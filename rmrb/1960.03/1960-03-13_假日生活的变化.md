    Changes in Holiday Life
    Yang Yunchang, a certain school of the People's Liberation Army

    In recent years, every holiday and Sunday, groups of people can be seen on campus, some carrying hoes and shovels to dig and loosen the soil; others carrying manure buckets, watering vegetables, and fertilizing the fields. On rainy days, some people habitually put on raincoats and walk through the mud to "inspect" or work in the vegetable garden. On holidays, people want to use it to engage in a few hours of production, and then rest and play. More and more people realize that after working for a few hours on holidays, taking a shower, reading a book, or watching a movie or visiting a park, they feel particularly happy and comfortable.

    Sometimes, in order to seize the weather and time, and strive for high speed, people often forget it's Sunday while working, and only say after being reminded, "Ah! So yesterday was Sunday!" In a school's voluntary labor activity, everyone fought hard for more than ten days. Family members who came home for the holidays also enthusiastically joined the ranks of labor. Primary school students on vacation also worked happily with uncles and aunts. The younger children couldn't pick up or dig, but they organized a water delivery team themselves, with sweat all over their little faces, running around and carrying water for most of the day.

    These things are small compared to the Great Leap Forward, the rapid and leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production. But it also reflects a side of the growth of people's communist ideology.

    This conscious habit of labor will enrich the content of holiday life and increase its fun.

    假日生活的变化
    解放军某校　杨运昌
    近年来，每到假日、星期天，只见校园内三五成群，有的扛起锄头、铁锹去挖地、松土；有的挑着粪桶、浇菜、肥田。下雨天，有人总是习惯地披着雨衣、踏着泥泞在菜园“视察”或劳动。假日，人们都想利用它搞上几小时的生产，而后再去休息、游玩。越来越多的人们体会到，在假日劳动几小时之后洗洗澡、看看书或者看电影、游公园，心情上就特别的愉快、舒坦。
    有时，为了抢天气抢时间、力争高速度，人们在劳动中往往是忘记了星期天，经人提醒后才说：“啊！原来昨天是星期天！”在一次校内的义务劳动中，大家一直奋战了十几天。假日回家来的家属也热情地投入了劳动的行列。放了假的小学生，也和叔叔阿姨们一起干的欢。年纪小的孩子们挑不起挖不动，但他们自己组织了送水队，一个个小脸上全是汗，跑来跑去端着水送了大半天。
    这些事和大跃进、工农业生产的日新月异、突飞猛进地发展比起来，是微小的。可是这也反映了人们共产主义思想成长的侧面。
    这种自觉的劳动习惯将会丰富假日生活的内容，增加乐趣。
