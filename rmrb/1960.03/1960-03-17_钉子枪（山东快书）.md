Si Dong doesn't talk short, doesn't talk long, but talks about Huang Caifang on our construction site. She hasn't been here at our construction site for a long time, only a year, but she has set a good example through diligent study and hard work; plastering, bricklaying, she is strong in all kinds of work, everyone says she is clever and skilled. One day, after Huang finished work and had dinner, she felt a pain in her neck, only because she had been nailing the ceiling with her head tilted today, twisting her neck so sore that it felt like she had been slapped. Little Huang covered her neck and lay on the bed, closing her eyes and thinking: Can this work be mechanized? Little Huang was thinking when suddenly there was a "bang," which startled her awake. It turned out that her nephew Mao Mao was being naughty, pointing a toy gun at her. Mao Mao said, "Auntie, why are you unhappy and just
  sleeping? Why don't you take me out for a stroll?" Little Huang said, "Good Mao Mao, please don't bother me, Auntie's neck hurts today." Mao Mao said, "Who hit Auntie's big neck? I will definitely shoot him with this gun." Saying that, he shot out another cork, and the cork hit the ceiling. Little Huang thought to herself when she saw it, Mao Mao's little gun, there is something to it, if the cork can be replaced with an iron nail, and the trigger is pulled, the iron nail will be shot out, the spring will nail the nail to the ceiling, then there is no need to tilt the neck and have a sore tendon. Little Huang took Mao Mao's toy gun to look at it, looked at it left and right, examining it carefully. After looking at it for a long time, she turned around and ran, she ran to the Party branch of the construction site in one breath. Little Huang said, "Branch Secretary, I want to make an innovation
  suggestion, to change the way of nailing ceilings, which saves effort and is more efficient." The Branch Secretary said, "Innovative operations are really good, I don't know what your idea is?" Little Huang hurriedly handed over the toy gun, which made the Branch Secretary confused. Little Huang said, "This thing can shoot corks, if the spring is stronger, it can also nail nails to the wall." The Branch Secretary said that this method can be tested, the Party will definitely help you realize this good idea. Little Huang was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth, she immediately ran to the machine shop, busily disassembled the little gun to see, looked at the barrel, and then looked at the spring. She took out a notebook and tore off a large piece of white paper with a "chila" sound, took off her fountain pen from her chest, and sat at the table to draw a blueprint. After drawing the blueprint, she looked for parts, and found iron pipes and springs. After Little Huang gathered the materials, she asked the fitter Lao Ma to help, and the Branch Secretary also came to participate in the battle. In one night, they made a "nail gun." The next morning, everyone took it to the construction site to test it, and in a flash, a group of people came. They saw Little Huang aiming the "gun" at the ceiling, and with a "bang" an iron nail was nailed to the ceiling. Everyone clapped and laughed when they saw it, and said, "Okay, okay, this method is very appropriate." Technician Xiao Meng took the "nail gun" and said, "This thing is really good to use, it can liberate the heavy labor of nailing ceilings, but the efficiency is not high enough, can it be changed to a 'machine gun'?"
  (Aside) Gosh! You want to shoot continuously! When the Branch Secretary heard this, he praised repeatedly:
  "Xiao Meng's opinion is a good idea, let's form a 'three-way combination' group, cadres, workers, and technicians discuss together, and change this 'single shot' to a 'machine gun'." Xiao Meng said: "We just lack design materials." Little Huang said, "Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry!" After speaking, she turned around and ran out, and ran into the toy department of the department store in one breath, and shouted to buy a gun. The salesperson said, "I don't know which one you want to buy, there are 'Luger', 'Mauser', and 'big cover guns'." Little Huang said, "I will buy several kinds if there are several kinds, I want to buy all kinds of guns."
  (Aside) Gosh! This is going to open an arsenal! Little Huang bought a large number of guns and ran back to the machine shop. Everyone disassembled this one, looked at that one, examining each one carefully. After looking, they started to make the "gun", working for three nights in a row, changing it, testing it, changing and testing, and finally made a "machine gun". The day of the test was really lively, the construction site was like an ocean of people, Little Huang stood on the springboard, picked up the "gun", ping ping pong pong the sound shook the sky, and she nailed ten square meters in one minute, saving effort, safe, and efficient. This one said, from now on, there is no need to use hands to nail the ceiling; that one said, a new one has been added to the history of construction
  chapter; the Party Branch Secretary happily opened his mouth:
  "To carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in a big way, everyone must use their brains to come up with ideas."

    钉子枪（山东快书）
    斯冬不说短，不说长，说一说咱们工地上的黄采芳。她来咱工地一年日子不算长，勤学苦练作出了好榜样；抹灰、砌砖她的工作样样强，人人说她心灵手巧不外行。这一日，小黄下班吃过了饭，只觉得，脖子疼的慌，只因为，她今天歪着脑袋钉天花板，扭得脖酸筋胀好像挨了一巴掌。小黄她手捂脖子床上躺，两眼一合想主张：这活计能不能搞个机械化？小黄正在打主意，忽听得“叭”的一声响，吓得她睁眼一跳下了床。原来是她侄儿毛毛来淘气，拿着玩具手枪对她放。毛毛说：“姑姑你为啥闷闷不乐光
  睡觉，为啥不领我出去逛荡逛荡。”小黄说：“乖毛毛你快别来缠我，姑姑今个脖子疼得慌。”毛毛说：“谁打了姑姑的大脖子，我一定给他这一枪。”说着“叭”的又打出一颗软木塞，软木塞一下子打在天棚上。小黄她一看心暗想，毛毛的小枪儿，可有文章，要能把软木塞换个铁钉子，一扣板机铁钉就出膛，弹簧把钉子钉在天棚上，那可就不用歪着脖筋疼得慌。小黄她拿过毛毛的手枪看，左看右看细端详，看罢多时，转身就跑，她一口气跑到工地党支部。小黄说：“支部书记我要提个革新
  建议，钉天棚改改样，又省力来效率强。”支部书记说：“革新操作可实在好，不知你有啥主张？”小黄忙把手枪儿递过去，只弄得支部书记莫名其妙。小黄说：“这东西能打软木塞，弹簧再强些，也能把钉子钉墙上。”支部书记连说这个办法可试验，党一定帮助你实现这个好主张。小黄乐的合不上嘴，立刻跑到机械房，忙把小枪卸开看，看看枪筒，又看弹簧。她顺手掏出个笔记本，“吃啦”一声扯下白纸一大张，胸前摘下自来水笔，坐在桌前画图样。画好了图样，又找零件，找来了铁管和弹簧。小黄把材料凑齐后，又去请钳工老马来帮忙，支部书记也赶来参战，一夜工夫，造好了一杆“钉子枪”。天明后，大家伙拿到工地去试验，一刹时来了人一帮，只见小黄把“枪”对准天花板，“叭”一声一颗铁钉子钉在天棚上，大家一见拍手乐，都说“行，行，这个办法挺妥当。”技术员小孟拿过这杆“钉子枪”，他说：“这东西可真够好使，钉天棚的笨重劳动得解放，可就是效率还不算太高，能不能改成‘机关枪’？”
  （夹白）吓！还要打连发呢！支部书记闻言连声称赞：
  “小孟的意见是好主张，咱们组成个‘三结合’小组，干部、工人、技术人员一块商量，把这杆‘单打子’改成‘机关枪’。”小孟说：“就是缺少设计资料。”小黄说：“别忙，别忙，你别忙！”说完转身往外跑，一口气走进百货公司玩具部，开口就嚷买手枪。营业员说：“不知你要买哪样，有‘橹子’、‘匣子’还有‘大盖枪’”。小黄说：“有几种来我买几种，我要把各式各样的枪儿都买上。”
  （夹白）吓！这要开兵工厂啦！小黄买了大批枪儿跑回机械房。大伙儿卸开了这个，看那个，一个一个看端详。看罢动手把“枪”做，一连熬了三个晚上，改了试，试了改，试试改改，终于制成了一杆“机关枪”。试验那天可真够热闹，工地上人群似海洋，小黄站在跳板上，端起“枪”，乒乒乓乓震天响，一分钟就钉完十平方米，又省力，又安全，效率又强。这个说，从此钉天棚不用手；那个说，建筑史上又添了新的一
  章；党支部书记欢欢喜喜开了腔：
  “大闹技术革新和技术革命，人人要开动脑筋出主张。”
