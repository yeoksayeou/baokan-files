    Waste is Not Waste
    Zhang Xianjia
    Having read the comprehensive utilization page on the seventh edition of the March 6th People's Daily, I learned that many things we used to call waste actually have a lot of uses. "Waste is not waste" has made me deeply moved.
    First, I thought of Tao Kan of the Jin Dynasty. This man, who advocated cherishing every minute, also cherished waste. He used to collect bamboo heads and wood scraps discarded by bamboo and wood workers. People laughed at him at the time. Later, when shipbuilding was short of nails, he took out the bamboo heads, cut them into bamboo nails, and built the ship. Another day, after a heavy snow, the road was slippery, so he spread the wood scraps on the road, making it easier for people to walk. Only then did people realize that the bamboo heads and wood scraps he collected were not useless after all. Tao Kan can be said to be a person in ancient times who was mindful of waste utilization.
    However, the bamboo heads and wood scraps collected by Tao Kan were only used to make bamboo nails and pave roads, and their use was not very great. Moreover, when he collected them, he may not have foreseen these two uses. This is very different from our current waste utilization and comprehensive material utilization. Now, not only bamboo heads and wood scraps have great uses, but also fish scales, pig bile, and even sludge and waste gas have become useful things. Take wood scraps, for example. They can be used to make plywood, rayon, artificial wool, alcohol, glucose, and can also be used to burn bricks, feed pigs, etc., which is much more, much greater, and much more far-reaching than Tao Kan's use of them to pave roads.
    I also thought of the problem of "waste land" and the problem of "waste time." In our socialist construction's Great Leap Forward years, every piece of land and every minute were fully utilized by the heroic figures of our new era. Just as there is no waste and no idlers now, abandoned land and moments of time will not be wasted.
    Take the situation in my commune as an example: Since the establishment of the People's Commune, there really are no idlers. Loafers have long been eliminated, old men take care of livestock, old women look after children in nurseries, and even the children in nurseries use their playtime to dig wild vegetables in the fields to supplement their non-staple food. The elderly in the Homes for the Aged do not want to be idle either, wanting to grow vegetables and raise chickens to increase the wealth of society. With agriculture as the foundation and a vigorous grasp of production, there is no waste land in the countryside. Under the slogan of "Every inch of land must be contested," all waste land has been reclaimed. After expanding the cultivated area, even the gaps in front of and behind houses are planted with melons and vegetables. There are many old graves in the wheat fields, and this year they are all planted with pumpkins, making them embellishments in the green wheat fields. People in the cities may say that there must be a lot of waste in the countryside, right? That's not right! The same is true in the countryside. The so-called waste has also been fully utilized. Not only are human and animal manure already excellent fertilizers, but even waste wall and house soil are watered with human manure and urine to make soil fertilizer; various wild plants are also fully utilized, either as non-staple food or as livestock feed. As for the farmers' preciousness of time during the Great Leap Forward in production, it goes without saying. Currently, they are vigorously grasping wheat field management, spring plowing and production, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, planting vegetables and reclaiming wasteland. Everyone starts early and works late, fighting hard. Rejoicing at the spring rain, they will immediately accumulate water to preserve moisture; encountering a temperature drop, they will immediately light fires to prevent frost. Truly, every minute and every second is tightly grasped. In the Great Leap Forward countryside after communization, many places have achieved no idlers, no waste land, no waste, and no waste time.
    Let us achieve no idle people, no waste land, no waste materials, and no waste time on all fronts of socialist construction! Let every person, every piece of land, every piece of material, and every moment of time fully play its role in our socialist construction!

### 废物不废

    废物不废
    张先甲
    看到3月6日人民日报第七版综合利用专页，知道我们过去所说的许多废物，其实是有很多用处的，废物不废，不禁深有所感。
    首先想到了晋朝的陶侃，这个主张要爱惜每一分光阴的人，对于废物，也是很爱惜的。他曾经把竹木工弃置不用的竹头、木屑都收集起来。当时人们都笑他。后来，造船正好缺少钉子，他把竹头拿了出来，削成竹钉，造成了船。又一天大雪之后，路滑难行，他把木屑都撒在路上，便利了人们的行走。这样，人家才知道他收集的竹头、木屑之类，其实并非无用之物。陶侃可说是古人中对于废物利用的有心人了。
    不过，陶侃所收集的竹头、木屑，只不过是用来造竹钉和铺路，用处并不很大。而且他在收集时也很可能并没有预见到就有这两项用途。这和我们目前的废物利用、物资综合利用是有很大不同的。我们现在，岂仅是竹头、木屑之类有很大的用处，像鱼鳞、猪胆，乃至污泥、废气也都成为有用之物了。就拿木屑来说，就可以做胶合板、人造丝、人造毛、酒精、葡萄糖，还可以用来烧砖、喂猪等等，比陶侃用来铺路，用途就多得多和大得多，意义更深远得多了。
    我还连想到“废地”的问题，“废时”的问题。在我们社会主义建设大跃进的年代里，每一块土地，每一分光阴，在我们新时代的英雄人物手下，都充分发挥了它的作用。正同现在没有废物、没有闲人一样，废弃的土地，片刻的光阴，也是不会让它浪费的。
    就拿我所在的公社情况来说吧：自从成立了人民公社以后，真是没有闲人了。二流子早就被消灭，老大爷照料牲口，老大娘在托儿所看小孩，托儿所的小孩也利用游戏时间在地里挖野菜补充副食。敬老院的老人们也都不愿闲着，要种种菜，养养鸡，为社会生产增加一分财富。以农业为基础，大抓生产以后，农村中也已经没有废地了。在“寸土必争”的口号下，所有废地都开了荒。扩大了耕地面积之后，连宅前屋后的隙地，也都种上了瓜类和蔬菜。麦地里有好多座老坟，今年也都种上了南瓜，让它成为青青麦地里的点缀。城市里的人也许说，农村中的废物一定很多吧？那才不对呢！农村中也是一样，所谓废物也都得到了充分的利用，不但人畜粪便早就是上好的肥料，连废墙屋土也都浇上人粪尿作成土化肥；各种野生植物，也在充分利用，或作副食品，或作牲畜饲料。至于在生产大跃进的日子里，农民们对于光阴的宝贵更不必说，目前正在大抓麦田管理，春耕生产，积肥送肥，种菜开荒。大家起早贪黑，努力奋战，喜逢春雨，马上就要积水保墒；偶遇降温，立刻就要燃火防霜冻，真是一分一秒时间也都紧紧抓住。在公社化后的大跃进的农村中，很多地方做到了无闲人，无废地，无废物，无废时了。
    让我们在社会主义建设各个战线上都做到人无闲人，地无废地，物无废物，时无废时吧！让每一个人、每一块地方、每一件物资、每一刻光阴都为我们的社会主义建设充分发挥它的作用吧！
