The Preparatory Committee for the 50th Anniversary of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day held a grand reception tonight in the magnificent banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People, warmly celebrating the 50th Anniversary of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day.

Vice Premier Chen Yi thanked the ambassadors and their wives, chargés d'affaires and their wives for attending the reception, and wished them good health. He thanked the female experts and wives of experts from the Soviet Union and other countries for their help in China's construction, and wished them good health.

The banquet hall, illuminated by spotlights, was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and unity. More than 4,000 Chinese and foreign women representatives gathered to frequently raise their glasses to congratulate the glorious festival of working women around the world, and to toast the unbreakable friendship and unity of the people and women of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, the great unity of the people and women of the world, and the defense of world peace and the happiness of women and children.

Peng Zhen, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Mayor of Beijing, Li Fuchun, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Lu Dingyi, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, Member of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Guo Moruo and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Zhang Zhizhong, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the reception.

Also invited to attend the reception were women's delegations from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, and Japan, as well as representatives from the International Democratic Women's Federation. At 6:00 PM, Peng Zhen, Chen Yi, and Li Fuchun, accompanied by Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Vice Chairmen Deng Yingchao, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Shi Liang, Zhang Yun, Yang Zhihua, Liu Qingyang, and Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, entered the banquet hall, at which time the audience burst into warm applause.

Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke first at the reception, extending the warmest congratulations on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation to the foreign friends and women representatives from all walks of life in the capital who attended the reception today.

Cai Chang said that as the people of our country are striving for the sustained leap forward in our socialist construction, and are advancing triumphantly to better and comprehensively realize the 1960 construction plan, tens of thousands of women red banner pacesetters and advanced red banner collectives have emerged throughout the country, and the broad masses of women have reported good news from all fronts. At this time, we are particularly happy to be able to gather with friends from all countries to celebrate the 50th anniversary of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day.

Cai Chang said that today's gathering is a symbol of the unity of women of all countries. In order to defend world peace and for the happiness of women and children, Chinese women will unremittingly strengthen and consolidate the unity of women in socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen and consolidate the unity with women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for national democratic revolution, and strengthen and consolidate the unity with women in all peace-loving countries around the world. We know that the power displayed by the unity of women all over the world is of great significance to the great unity of the people of the world. The current situation is very good. The strength of the socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the world is unprecedentedly strong. It is precisely the East Wind continuing to prevail over the West Wind, the enemy rotting day by day, and we getting better day by day. At present, American imperialism is playing with peace tricks on the one hand and actively carrying out arms expansion and war preparations on the other. We must be highly vigilant against the conspiracy of American imperialism and thoroughly expose and smash it. Only in this way can the cause of peace and socialism surely achieve greater victory.

Finally, Cai Chang expressed the sincere gratitude and cordial greetings of Chinese women to the female experts and wives of experts from the Soviet Union and other countries present, for their tremendous brotherly assistance to China's socialist construction.

Kovrigina, head of the Soviet women's delegation, gave a toast at the reception. She congratulated all the women of China, especially the women who have obtained the red banner pacesetter and red banner collective, on achieving greater achievements in the future. She said that the fact that tens of thousands of Chinese women have won the honorary title of red banner pacesetter and red banner collective shows how highly the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government have evaluated the labor contributions of women. She said excitedly that the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government also highly value the labor of Soviet women. 253 Soviet women have won the title of Labor Hero, and tens of thousands of Soviet women have won the Labor Medal. She said that Soviet women assured the Party and the government that they would work more and better in the future. She asked everyone to raise their glasses and wish all Chinese sisters good health, wish them new achievements, and wish them a happy life.

Michiko Fujiwara, head of the Japanese women's delegation, gave a speech congratulating Chinese women on "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. She said that the facts of the Chinese women's movement prove that without socialism there would be no complete liberation of women. The Japanese people and Japanese women will make greater efforts in the future to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and overthrow American imperialism. She shouted: Long live the unity of the people of Japan and China! Long live world peace!

Mrs. Carov, representative of the International Democratic Women's Federation, gave a toast at the reception, wishing Chinese women happiness and wishing them a better future. She said that the outstanding achievements of Chinese women, their Great Leap Forward, is not only one of the most inspiring events in the fifty years of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, but also one of the most inspiring events in the history of all mankind. She finally shouted: Long live the great unity of women of all nations who love peace all over the world.

More than 1,900 people attended the reception, including ambassadors, chargés d'affaires, and diplomats from various countries to China and their wives, female experts from the Soviet Union and other countries who helped China's construction, and wives of experts, female foreign guests from various countries in Beijing, and international students.

Also attending the reception were female cadres who participated in the Long March, representatives of some "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetters" and "March 8th Red Banner Collectives" from various places and Beijing, heads of departments of the CPC Central Committee, departments of state organs, and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and leaders of Beijing.

    蔡畅说，当我国人民正在争取我国社会主义建设的持续跃进，为更好地全面地实现1960年的建设计划而高歌猛进的时候，我们全国涌现出了数以万计的妇女红旗手和红旗先进集体，广大妇女在各个战线上纷纷传来了捷报。在这个时候，我们能够和各国朋友欢聚一堂，庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年，使我们感到特别高兴。
    蔡畅说，今天我们的聚会，正是各国妇女团结的象征。为了保卫世界和平，为了妇女儿童的幸福，我们中国妇女将坚持不懈地加强和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义各国妇女的团结，加强和巩固同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲正在为民族民主革命而斗争的各国妇女的团结，加强和巩固同全世界一切爱好和平各国妇女的团结。我们知道，全世界妇女团结起来所显示的力量，对全世界人民大团结有着伟大意义。现在的形势好得很，社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的力量空前强大，正是东风继续压倒西风，敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。目前，美帝国主义正在一面玩弄和平手法，一面积极进行扩军备战。我们对于美帝国主义的阴谋必须提起高度的警惕，予以彻底揭露和粉碎。只要如此，和平和社会主义事业就一定能够取得更大的胜利。
