The victory of the People's Commune movement has accelerated the development of China's rural economy, especially the production teams that originally had slower economic development (roughly equivalent to the former advanced cooperatives), which we usually call poor teams, have seen an even more astonishing rate of development. In 1959, the first year after the realization of communization in China's rural areas, one-third of the poor teams across the country, that is, more than 70,000 poor teams, had caught up with the rich teams; another one-third of the poor teams reached the level of general teams; only one-third had not yet escaped the status of poor teams, but their economic conditions had also been improved to a certain extent. This is a major event with profound political and economic significance. We should take advantage of this great victory and advance, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, further accelerate the economic development of poor teams, and enable more poor teams to catch up with rich teams.

The concepts of "poor" and "rich" are just comparative terms, only describing that this part is poorer or richer than that part. The nature of this gap between rich and poor is fundamentally different from the vast gap between rich and poor caused by the private ownership of the means of production in the old society. The "poor" and "rich" differences between regions, communes, and production teams in our rural areas are only the differences in economic levels caused by the faster economic development of this part and the slower development of the other part. Whether it is the "poor areas" and "poor teams" with slower economic development or the "rich areas" and "rich teams" with faster economic development, their economic conditions are, without exception, much better than before liberation. We will not discuss the inhuman and dark rule imposed on the vast number of working peasants by the old society from the political and social system aspects, and the slave-like life that this rule caused to the vast number of peasants, which is still fresh in the memory of the people. Just from the perspective of farmers' income, we can see that the lives of the vast number of farmers have been greatly improved. During the first five-year plan period, the average income of farmers across the country increased by 30%; in the two years of 1958 and 1959, it increased by about 10% each year compared with the previous year. Such a speed is unprecedented in the history of China's rural economic development and has never occurred in the history of rural economic development in any capitalist country. Of course, this does not mean that China's rural economy is already very rich, or that the economic development level of some areas in China has reached a very rich level. We cannot say that. From the perspective of the national rural economic situation, including those relatively wealthy areas and units, China's rural economy is still relatively poor. Of course, this relatively poor situation is changing rapidly. It can also be affirmed that with the continued leap forward in agricultural production, especially the rapid development of mechanization, this relatively poor situation will disappear even faster. But at present, the production level of our rural areas is still relatively low, and the economic situation of our rural areas is still relatively poor. Only when all production activities that can use machines to replace manual labor are mechanized can we fundamentally change the current relatively backward state of agricultural production in our country and completely change the poor face of our rural areas. Therefore, whether it is areas and units that are relatively poor now, or areas and units that are relatively rich, they should try their best to develop their own economy, and the relatively poor areas and units need to develop their own economy with the greatest efforts and at a higher speed.

The difference in income in our rural areas includes the difference between this region and that region; within the same region, there is also the difference between this commune and that commune, or the difference between this production team and that production team; within the same production team, there are also differences in income between households. This article mainly discusses the difference between production teams. This difference in income is usually about one time, with the highest difference reaching two to three times, and the lowest being 40% to 50%. The production teams with low incomes have an annual income of only about 150 yuan per labor force. The production teams with high incomes can have an annual income of 500 yuan, or even 600 or 700 yuan per labor force. There are many reasons for this difference. For example, the quality of the soil, the amount of arable land, the length of the frost-free period, whether there is water conservancy or water damage, diversified operations or single operations, as well as the impact of national economic construction, etc., are all reasons for the speed of economic development and the level of farmers' income. However, the most fundamental and most important reason is the revolutionary drive of the cadres and peasant masses in these regions and units. We are dialectical materialists, that is, we recognize the role of objective conditions in the development of things, so we respect objective reality in our work and strictly proceed from objective reality and act in accordance with the laws of development of objective things. However, contrary to metaphysical mechanical materialists, we believe that the subjective initiative of the people is an extremely great force. In many cases, through the active efforts of the people, objective conditions can be changed, and objective laws can be recognized and mastered, so that they can benefit the people. For example, the impact of the length of the frost-free period on crop growth in agricultural production. At present, it is indeed difficult for us to extend the frost-free period in areas with short frost-free periods, but we can take other methods to avoid or reduce the unfavorable factors of short frost-free periods to develop agricultural production and rural economy in that area. For example, we can accelerate the maturity of crops as much as possible, or fully develop frost-resistant plants and plants that are not affected by frost, which can overcome the unfavorable factors of long frost periods to a large extent. Another example is that if the soil is not good, it can be solved by soil improvement; if there is no water conservancy or there is water damage, it can be overcome by water conservancy construction; and if there is less arable land, it can be solved by fully utilizing the potential of the land, increasing the multiple cropping index, implementing intercropping, and using all open space and vigorously reclaiming wasteland. In short, all these seemingly difficult to change objective unfavorable factors can be changed through the efforts of the people, rather than a destiny predetermined by the heavens.

As for other factors that cause slow economic development, such as single operation and failure to develop diversified operations, it is entirely a matter of the drive of the leaders there. China has good natural climate conditions and a wide variety of material resources above and below the ground, which are suitable for the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. As long as we have sufficient drive and try every means to find solutions, all people's communes can develop diversified operations well. There are conditions for developing animal husbandry in any region of our country; fisheries can be developed where there is water; trees can be planted everywhere, and forestry, fruit industry, sericulture, and other diverse and high-income operations can be developed. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery can all be comprehensively utilized, and their products all have the need for preliminary processing, which can be vigorously developed. Other sideline occupations, such as building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel, are growing exponentially with the development of national and commune economic construction, and people's communes everywhere can develop them in large quantities. Small amounts of mineral deposits, which are generally considered to have no industrial mining value, are mined by communes or production teams, which not only increases national wealth but also increases the income of communes and production teams. Diversified operations can be carried out in any place. The problem lies with the leaders, whether the leaders adopt a positive attitude and dare to think and act to operate more items, or are stubbornly conservative and do not operate more items.

In addition, there are some other factors that also affect the speed of economic development between regions and units, causing some differences in income. For example, rural areas located around large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining areas, and along railways, rivers, and highways, because their products can be quickly transported to cities, their selling prices will be higher; with the convenient conditions of advanced production technology in cities, the utilization rate of their by-products is also greater. Rural areas far from cities and transportation lines not only have to transport all products over a longer distance, spending more freight, but also many fresh products such as vegetables, fruits, and aquatic products are prone to spoilage and loss. In comparison, the income of rural areas around urban industrial and mining areas and near transportation lines is of course higher. This is the source of differential rent in capitalist society, as pointed out by Marx in "Das Kapital." Now, in our socialist country, the so-called differential rent and high land prices near cities no longer exist. At the same time, there is no such difference in the state's collection of agricultural taxes and other taxes. Therefore, this difference has a more significant impact on the speed of rural economic development and farmers' income. This is one situation. Another situation is that crop distribution formed due to soil, climate, production experience, and the overall economic construction layout of the country, such as food crop areas, cash crop areas, etc., also causes a certain degree of difference in economic development and farmers' income. With the development of the entire national economy, the rapid development of industrial raw material crops has been promoted; due to the stability of national prices, especially the stability of grain prices, this has formed a difference in income between cash crop areas and grain-producing areas. The difference in income between rural areas caused by these two situations is not a problem that can be completely solved by the drive of rural leaders, but is a problem of the overall economic construction layout of the country. It will be gradually and completely resolved in the process of the development of the entire socialist economic construction, the further development of the national transportation industry, and the agricultural mechanization movement. However, this does not mean that rural leaders and commune members are powerless. Through efforts and effective measures, this difference can still be narrowed. Some areas have increased their income by improving labor productivity and reducing costs; some areas have greatly improved transportation conditions by building roads, increasing income; and more places have vigorously developed industry and agricultural product processing, which not only improved labor productivity, but also improved the utilization rate of agricultural and sideline products, and also increased income, and so on.

From this, it seems that drive is a key to solving slow economic development and low income. This truth has not only been proven by the fact that a large number of poor teams have caught up with rich teams after communization, but also many such examples appeared before the communization in 1958. For example, the "poor stick" cooperative led by Comrade Wang Guofan of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, which is famous throughout the country, is located in deep mountains and valleys. When the agricultural cooperative was first established, the entire cooperative only had "three donkey legs." However, they had a great drive. As early as 1956, the first year of advanced cooperativization, they greatly changed the poor situation. The output of grain and cotton achieved the targets set by the "Agricultural Development Program" eleven years ahead of schedule. The average income per member reached 114.4 yuan, and the average income per household reached 536.9 yuan, exceeding the living standards of the past well-off middle peasants. The Dashan Agricultural Cooperative of Lijiazhai Township, Junan County, Shandong Province is also an example. This cooperative is also located in mountainous areas. With the spirit of the foolish old man who removed the mountains, they overcame the poor mountains and bad waters in 1956 and overcame the largest flood in 20 years and the largest wind disaster in 70 years. They also changed the poor situation and made the income of most members exceed the level of well-off middle peasants. Chairman Mao praised them and said: "The foolish old man removed the mountains, transformed China, and Lijiazhai is a good example." There are also many such agricultural cooperatives in other regions.

Of course, before communization, under the leadership of advanced cooperatives, although many rural areas were rapidly changing their original poor face, due to the small organizational scale of advanced cooperatives and the limitations of single operations, compared with the current situation after the people's communes, this change was greatly inferior in terms of both speed and extent. In the first year after communization—1959, about one-third of the poor teams across the country had caught up with the level of rich teams. Some regions with rapid development, such as Jilin, Shanxi, Guangxi, Liaoning, and Shanghai, have already had two-thirds of the poor teams catch up with or even exceed the level of rich teams; one-third of the poor teams have reached the level of general teams. Although the current poor teams have not yet caught up with the general teams and rich teams, they have also made great improvements. According to a survey of four communes, Dongshan and Nanfeng, in the Hainan Island area, the income gap between the rich teams (ie, the original advanced cooperatives) and the poor teams was 84% before communization, but it has now been reduced to 58%, and the income level of these poor teams has exceeded the level of the general advanced cooperatives before communization and is close to the level of the relatively wealthy advanced cooperatives before communization. In 1959, the income of the production teams that were still called "poor teams" in these four communes was 48.5 yuan per person on average, while the average income of the general teams before communization was only 41 yuan per person, and the rich teams were only a little more than 55 yuan.

After communization, the most important reason why so many poor teams were able to catch up with rich teams was of course the result of the cadres and members of these poor teams giving full play to their drive. But there are also some important factors, that is, the strong support of the state, the strong assistance of the rich teams, and the support of the people's communes to the poor teams in all aspects. After the Party and Chairman Mao put forward that agriculture is the development foundation of China's national economy based on China's specific conditions, and formulated the policy of "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture," the state strengthened its support for the people's communes, especially the poor teams, in all aspects. In 1959, the state issued a huge agricultural production investment of 1 billion yuan and supplied a large amount of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and other agricultural production materials. This year, the state's production investment in communes has increased by 50% compared with last year, reaching 1.5 billion yuan, and the supply of various agricultural production materials has also increased even more. Under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the communist style of the broad masses of people has been greatly promoted, and the broad rich teams have given selfless assistance to the poor teams and carried out communist large-scale cooperation, which is also an important reason for the rapid change of the poor teams. The Bahu and Xingnong production teams of the Xinnong People's Commune in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, were unable to build water conservancy projects and purchase irrigation and drainage machinery due to the weakness of manpower and material resources in the past, and thousands of acres of paddy fields were reduced in production every year due to lack of water. In the spring of 1959, with the assistance of the rich teams, a reservoir was built and a diesel water pump was purchased, and production developed rapidly, and the income of the members caught up with the rich teams. The establishment of the people's communes has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the poor teams to quickly change their backward appearance. The people's communes are large in scale and have abundant manpower and material resources. They can not only send strong leading cadres to the poor teams to "station and help" and strengthen the leadership of the poor teams politically and organizationally, but also provide strong support in terms of manpower and material resources. Due to the characteristics of "large in scale and public ownership" of the people's communes, and due to the implementation of the "unified leadership, multi-level accounting" system by the people's communes, they can provide care and convenience to the poor teams in terms of crop layout and production arrangements, allowing the poor teams to plant more crops with greater income and helping them develop more diversified operations with greater income. The Taojiabao and Dongwan poor teams of the Miaoqiao Commune in Jiangsu Province, under the unified leadership of the commune, carried out communist large-scale cooperation among the production teams and built a long-overdue channel. Due to the completion of this farmland capital construction project, more than 10,000 acres of paddy fields were freed from waterlogging disasters. Although they suffered from a drought of more than 80 days in 1959, the rice in both teams achieved unprecedented harvests and caught up with the income level of the rich teams.

Of course, it should be emphasized that the poor teams catching up with the rich teams mainly depends on the self-reliance of the poor teams, and the determination and drive of the poor teams. Although the amount of state aid is increasing year by year, the amount distributed to each poor team is still not very large; although the support of the rich teams and the communist large-scale cooperation are rising more and more under the unified leadership of the Party and the commune, after all, our people's communes are now implementing the three-level ownership system based on the production team ownership, and the poor teams should not and should not use the support of the rich teams without compensation too much. Therefore, on the one hand, we advocate that the rich teams should greatly promote the communist style and support the poor teams; on the other hand, we should encourage the poor teams to be self-reliant and pay attention to the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit and equivalent exchange. This is not only conducive to the rapid change of the poor teams, but also to the development of production by the rich teams and the promotion of the comprehensive and rapid development of the entire rural economy.

A large number of poor teams catching up with rich teams is not only a major issue related to the improvement of the lives of the broad masses of people, but also an important factor in promoting the better and more comprehensive leap forward of China's entire rural economy. Only when the economic development of more poor teams catches up with the rich teams can we raise the overall rural economic development of our country to a new and higher level. This is a matter of great economic significance and a glorious political task. This year, we should take all effective measures to make all the poor teams catch up with the general teams, and make more poor teams reach the level of the rich teams. We believe that as long as we better use the greatly increased assistance from the state, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, carry out communist large-scale cooperation, further promote the communist style of rich teams supporting poor teams, and the broad cadres and members of the poor teams give full play to their drive and implement hard work, practical work, and skillful work, we will definitely be able to successfully complete this historically significant task.

    充分发挥人民公社的优越性，加速穷队赶上富队
    人民公社运动的胜利，加速了我国农村经济的发展，特别是原来经济发展较慢的生产队（大体上相当于过去的高级社），即我们通常称为的穷队，发展速度更是惊人。1959年，我国农村实现公社化后的第一年，全国的穷队中已经有三分之一，即七万多个穷队赶上了富队；又有三分之一的穷队，达到了一般队的水平；只有三分之一还没有摆脱穷队地位，但它们的经济状况，也已经有了一定的改善。这是一件具有深刻政治意义和经济意义的大事情。我们应当在这一伟大胜利的基础上乘胜前进，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，进一步加速穷队经济的发展，使更多的穷队赶上富队。
      “穷”和“富”这两个概念，只是一种比较的说法，只是形容这一部分比那一部分较穷些或较富些而已。这种穷富差别的性质，同旧社会生产资料私人占有制所造成的穷富悬殊是根本不同的。我国农村中地区之间、公社之间、生产队之间“穷”、“富”差别，只是由于这一部分的经济发展速度快一些，另一部分发展速度慢一些而造成的经济水平高些低些的差别。无论经济发展速度较慢的“穷区”、“穷队”，还是经济发展较快的“富区”、“富队”，它们的经济状况同解放前比较起来，都已经毫无例外地好得多了。我们且不从政治方面和社会制度方面论述旧社会加在广大劳动农民头上的惨无人道的黑暗统治和这种统治给广大农民造成的奴隶式的生活，这是全国农民记忆犹新的；只从农民收入方面考察，就可以看出，广大农民的生活已经有了极大的提高和改善。在第一个五年计划期间，全国农民的平均收入增长了30％；在1958年和1959年两年间，每年又都比上一年增长了10％左右，这样的速度在我国农村经济发展史上是空前的，世界任何资本主义国家的农村经济发展史上也不曾有过。当然，这决不是说我国的农村经济已经很富裕，或者说我国农村已经有一部分地区的经济发展水平，达到了很富裕的水平。不能这样说。从全国农村经济状况看，包括那些比较富裕的地区和单位在内，我国农村经济还是比较穷的。当然，这种比较穷的状况正在迅速地变化着。也可以肯定，随着农业生产的继续跃进，特别是机械化运动的迅速发展，这种比较穷的状况会更快地消失。但是在目前，我国农村的生产水平毕竟还是比较低的，我国农村经济状况毕竟还是比较穷的。只有当一切可以使用机器代替手工劳动的生产活动都实现了机械化，我们才能够从根本上改变我国农业生产目前这种比较落后的状况，才能使我国农村的贫穷面貌彻底改观。因此，无论是现在比较穷的地区和单位，或是比较富的地区和单位，都应该千方百计地发展自己的经济，比较穷的地区和单位更需要以最大的努力和更高的速度发展自己的经济。
    我国农村收入的差别，有这个地区与那个地区之间的差别；在同一个地区之内，又有这个公社与那个公社之间的差别，或者这个生产队与那个生产队之间的差别；在同一个生产队内，各户之间的收入也有差别。本文论述的主要是生产队与生产队之间的差别。这种收入之间的差别通常相差一倍左右，相差最高的达到两倍到三倍，低的也有40％到50％。收入低的生产队，每个劳动力一年收入只有一百五十元上下。收入高的生产队，每个劳动力一年收入可以达到五百元、甚至六七百元。形成这种差别的原因很多。比如土壤好坏，耕地多少，无霜期长短，有无水利或水害，多种经营还是单一经营，以及作物布局和国家经济建设的影响等等，都是造成经济发展速度快慢，农民收入高低的原因。但是，最根本最主要的原因，还是这些地区和单位的干部和农民群众的革命干劲。我们是辩证唯物论者，即承认客观条件在事物发展中的作用，因而在进行工作中尊重客观，严格地从客观实际出发，按照客观事物的发展规律办事。但是，我们同形而上学的机械唯物论者相反，认为人民群众的主观能动作用是一个极其伟大的力量，在许多场合，经过人民群众的积极努力，客观条件是可以改变的，客观规律是可以被认识、被掌握，使它为人民造福的。譬如农业生产上无霜期长短对作物生长的影响问题，在目前我们的确还很难使无霜期短的地区延长无霜期，但是我们可以采取另外的办法避开或减少无霜期短的不利因素，来发展那个地区的农业生产和农村经济，比如尽可能加速作物的成熟期，或者充分发展有霜期植物和霜冻对它不起作用的植物，这就可以在很大程度上克服有霜期长的不利因素。又如土壤不好，这可以通过土壤改良来解决；无水利或有水害，又可以通过水利工程建设来克服；耕地少更可以通过充分利用土地潜力，增加复种指数，实行套种间作，以及利用一切空地和大力开荒等等办法来解决。总之，这一切看来是很难改变的客观不利因素，都是可以通过人民群众的努力来加以改变的，而不是天老爷注定了的命运。
    至于造成经济发展缓慢的其他因素，如经营单一，没有发展多种经营，则完全是那里的领导人的干劲问题。我国自然气候条件良好，地上地下的物质资源多种多样，适宜于农林牧副渔各种经济的发展。只要鼓足干劲，千方百计地想办法，各个人民公社都是可以把多种经营很好地发展起来的。我国任何地区都存在着发展畜牧业的条件；有水的地方就可以发展渔业；树更是到处能种活的，可以发展林业、水果业、蚕桑业等等花样多、收入大的经营。农林牧渔都是可以综合利用的，其产品都有初步加工的需要，都可以大力发展。其他的副业如砖瓦砂石等等建筑材料，随着国家和公社经济建设的发展，需要量正在成倍地增长，各地人民公社都可以大量发展。一般被称为没有工业开采价值的小量矿藏，公社或生产队开采，既增加了国家财富，也增加了公社和生产队的收入。多种经营，任何一个地方都是有条件进行的，问题在于领导人，在于领导人是否采取积极态度，敢想敢干地去多经营几项，还是顽固保守，不去多经营。
    另外还有一些因素，也影响着地区间和单位间的经济发展速度，造成收入之间的若干差别。譬如处在大中城市、工矿区周围和铁路、河流、公路两旁的农村，由于它们的产品能够迅速运往城市，因而售价就会高些；借助于城市的先进生产技术的方便条件，它的副产品的利用率也大些。而距城市和交通线较远的农村，不仅一切产品都要经过较长路程的运输，花去更多的运费，而且有许多新鲜产品如蔬菜、水果、水产等等容易发生腐烂损失。两相比较，当然城市工矿区周围和交通线附近的农村收入要更高些，这就是马克思在“资本论”中所指出的资本主义社会中的级差地租的来源。现在，在我们社会主义国家中，已经不存在这种所谓级差地租和城市附近地价高等等问题了。同时，国家征收农业税和其他税收，也不存在这种差别。因此，这种差别对农村经济发展速度和农民收入的影响就更加显著地显现了出来。这是一种情况。另一种情况是由于土壤、气候和生产经验以及国家整个经济建设布局等因素而形成的作物分布，比如粮食作物区、经济作物区等等，也使经济发展和农民收入发生某种程度的差别。随着整个国民经济的发展，促进了工业原料作物的迅速发展；由于全国物价稳定，特别是粮价稳定，这就形成了经济作物区和产粮区之间收入高低的差别。这两种情况造成的农村间收入的差别，不是农村领导人的干劲能够完全解决的问题，而是整个国家的经济建设布局问题，它将在整个社会主义经济建设发展过程中，在国家交通运输事业进一步发展和农业机械化运动的过程中，逐步地得到完全的解决。但是，这并不是说农村领导人和公社社员群众就无能为力了。经过努力和采取有效措施，这种差别还是能够缩小的。有些地区采取提高劳动生产率、降低成本的办法，增加了自己的收入；有些地区大兴道路，使交通运输状况大为改善，增加了收入；更多的地方大办工业和农产品加工，不仅提高了劳动生产率，更提高了农副产品的利用率，也增加了收入，等等。
    由此看来，干劲是解决经济发展较慢和收入较少的一个关键，这一真理不仅为公社化后大量的穷队赶上富队的事实所证明，在1958年公社化以前，也出现了很多这样的例子。比如全国闻名的河北省遵化县王国藩同志领导的“穷棒子”社，地处深山大沟间，刚成立农业社的时候，全社只有“三条驴腿”。但是，他们有一股很大的干劲，远在1956年即高级合作化第一年就大大地改变了穷困的面貌，粮、棉产量提前十一年实现了“农业发展纲要”规定的指标，社员每人平均收入达到了一百一十四元四角，每户平均收入达到了五百三十六元九角，超过了过去富裕中农的生活水平。山东省莒南县厉家寨乡大山农业社也是一个例子，这个社也处在山区，他们以愚公移山的精神，1956年战胜了穷山恶水，克服了二十年来最大的水灾和七十年来最大的风灾，也改变了贫穷面貌，使大部分社员的收入超过了富裕中农的水平，毛主席曾称赞他们说：“愚公移山，改造中国，厉家寨是一个好例”。其他地区也有很多这样的农业社。
    当然在公社化以前，在高级社的领导下，虽然有许多农村迅速改变着原来的贫穷面貌，但是，由于高级社组织规模较小，受经营单一等局限性的影响，同现在人民公社化后的情况比较起来，这种变化无论在速度上、程度上就显得大为逊色了。公社化以后的第一年——1959年，全国已有三分之一左右的穷队，赶上了富队的水平。有些发展快的地区，如吉林、山西、广西、辽宁和上海等地，已经有三分之二的穷队赶上甚至超过了富队的水平；三分之一的穷队达到了一般队的水平。目前的穷队虽然还没有赶上一般队和富队，但也有了很大的改善。据海南岛地区的东山、南丰等四个公社的调查，公社化以前富队（即原高级社）同穷队的收入相差84％，现在已缩小到58％，而且这些穷队的收入水平，都超过了公社化前一般的高级社的水平，接近了公社化前比较富裕的高级社的水平。1959年这四个公社中的仍然被称为“穷队”的生产队的收入，每人平均四十八元五角，而公社化以前的一般队的平均收入，每人只有四十一元，富队也只有五十五元多一点。
    公社化以后，所以能够有这样大量的穷队赶上富队，最重要的当然是这些穷队的干部和社员大鼓干劲的结果。但是还有一些重要的因素，这就是国家的大力支持，富队的大力援助和人民公社对穷队从各方面的支援。党和毛主席根据我国的具体情况，提出农业是我国国民经济的发展基础，制定了“工业和农业同时并举”的方针以后，国家从各方面加强了对人民公社特别是对穷队的支援。1959年国家发放了十亿元的巨额农业生产投资，并且供应了大量的农业机械、化学肥料和其他的农业生产资料。今年国家对公社的生产投资又比去年增加了50％，达到了十五亿元，各种农业生产资料的供应量也有了更大的增长。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，广大人民群众的共产主义风格大大发扬起来了，广大富队对穷队给予了无私的援助，进行了共产主义大协作，这也是穷队迅速改变面貌的重要原因。吉林省蛟河县新农人民公社的巴虎、兴农两个生产队，过去由于人力物力单薄，无力兴修水利和购买排灌机械，年年有上千亩的水稻因缺水减产。1959年春天，在富队援助之下，修建了水库，并买了一部柴油抽水机，生产迅速地发展起来，社员收入赶上了富队。人民公社的建立，为穷队迅速改变落后面貌创造了空前有利的条件。人民公社规模大，人力物力雄厚，不仅可以派坚强的领导骨干到穷队去“驻点帮助”，在政治上、组织上加强对穷队的领导；也能够在人力、物力上给予大力支援。由于人民公社“一大二公”的特点，由于人民公社实行着“统一领导，分级核算”的制度，更能够在作物布局、生产安排方面对穷队给予照顾和方便，让穷队多种植一些收入更大的作物，帮助他们多发展一些收入更大的多种经营。江苏省妙桥公社陶家桥、洞湾等穷队，在公社的统一领导下，各个生产队进行共产主义大协作，修建了一条年久失修的渠道，由于这项农田基本建设工程的完成，使一万多亩稻田解除了水涝灾害，1959年虽然遭受了八十多天的旱灾袭击，两个队的水稻都获得了空前大丰收，都赶上了富队的收入水平。
    当然，应当强调指出，穷队赶上富队主要还是靠穷队的自力更生，靠穷队的决心和干劲。国家的援助数量尽管年年增长，但分到每一个穷队的数量毕竟还是不太多的；富队的支援和共产主义大协作尽管在党和公社的统一领导下正在愈益高涨，但是，我们的人民公社现在所实行的毕竟还是以生产队所有制为基本的三级所有制，穷队不能也不应该过多地无代价地使用富队的支援。因此，我们一方面提倡富队要大大发扬共产主义风格，支援穷队，另一方面又要鼓励穷队自力更生，注意实行互助互利和等价交换的原则。这不仅对穷队迅速改变面貌，同时对富队发展生产和促进整个农村经济的全面地迅速地发展，都是有利的。
    大量的穷队赶上富队，不仅是一个关系着广大群众生活改善的大问题，也是促进我国整个农村经济更好更全面地跃进的重要因素。只有更多的穷队的经济发展赶上了富队，我们才能够使我国整个的农村经济发展到一个新的更高的水平。这是一件具有巨大经济意义的事情，也是一项光荣的政治任务。今年，我们应当采取一切有效措施，使全部的穷队都赶上一般队，使更多的穷队达到富队的水平。我们相信，只要更好地运用国家大大增加了的援助，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，开展共产主义大协作，进一步发挥富队支援穷队的共产主义风格，加上穷队广大干部和社员鼓足干劲，实行苦干、实干、巧干，我们一定能够胜利完成这一具有重大历史意义的任务。
