Editorial: Run Agricultural Middle Schools More, Better, and Faster

After two years of effort, agricultural middle schools, as a completely new thing in the history of education in our country, have gained a foothold in rural areas. This is a great victory. Now, rural areas across the country are vigorously running agricultural middle schools. The rapid development and growth of agricultural middle schools is not accidental. The consolidation and development of people's communes and the continued leap forward in agricultural production urgently require a large number of technical talents. At the same time, with the gradual improvement of their economic lives, the broad masses of farmers also have further demands for cultural revolution. Under such circumstances, the broad masses of people warmly support the Party's "walking on two legs" approach to running schools, running both full-time schools and spare-time schools and half-day schools. Thus, a completely new type of school—the agricultural middle school—emerged and quickly became consolidated. Agricultural middle schools are the product of the agricultural leap forward and the people's communes, and also the product of implementing the Party's education policy.

Two years is not a long time. However, agricultural middle schools have already achieved great success, cultivated a large number of students, and trained both red and expert teachers. The achievements of agricultural middle schools have far-reaching significance. From this, it can be hoped that after we have universally implemented primary education, secondary education, and spare-time education in our vast rural areas, we will cultivate a large number of junior construction talents in a very short period of time to realize agricultural modernization and to meet the needs of people's communes for running industry, education, scientific research, health services, childcare, and various agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery undertakings. All of this will be a step towards the great goal of eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, eliminating the differences between workers and peasants, and eliminating the differences between mental and physical labor. However, not everyone clearly recognizes the important significance of agricultural middle schools. Some people say that agricultural middle schools don't look like schools. May I ask, what looks like a school? Does only a full-time school look like a school? The Party's "walking on two legs" approach to running schools requires various forms of schooling, mobilizing the strength of the masses to the greatest extent, and cultivating talents at the fastest speed. We not only have the form of full-time schools that combine teaching with productive labor, but also the form of spare-time schools that combine productive labor with learning, and also the form of half-work, half-study, half-day agricultural middle schools. Despite the variety of forms of schooling, they all have the same purpose: to cultivate laborers with socialist and communist consciousness and culture. All types of schools have their own strengths and are needed for socialist construction. The view of only valuing full-time schools and neglecting spare-time and half-day schools is actually the idea of walking on only one leg instead of two. This is just the trouble of the old and corrupt educational views of the bourgeoisie. Some people also believe that agricultural middle schools are only useful for the present, and that when our country's education develops in the future, agricultural middle schools will no longer be needed. This view is also short-sighted. With the rise of our country's economic, cultural, and educational undertakings, agricultural middle schools will gradually consolidate and improve. This is an inevitable trend. The future of agricultural middle schools is infinitely broad. Running more and better agricultural middle schools today prepares for improving agricultural middle schools tomorrow. The role of agricultural middle schools in carrying out cultural and technical revolutions in rural areas is obvious. It is even more certain that it will play a greater role in the future.

The major task of agricultural middle schools at present is to cultivate technical talents and management personnel for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in the communes and for agricultural modernization. At the same time, agricultural middle schools will also prepare for the cultivation of higher quality talents for national construction, so that qualified young people can continue to improve. Over the past two years, agricultural middle schools in various regions have been consolidated and improved through rectification, and have achieved great results. We must build on this foundation and run more agricultural middle schools in accordance with the principle of "actively promoting, vigorously developing, consolidating in a timely manner, and continuously improving," and further improve agricultural middle schools. This is an urgent task in current rural education work.

Primary education has been basically universalized in our country. This year, a large number of graduates from senior primary schools will emerge across the country. In addition to the absorption of some by full-time middle schools, agricultural middle schools can also absorb a portion. Last year, all regions that ran agricultural middle schools absorbed a large number of graduates from senior primary schools. Now, while running the existing agricultural middle schools well, all regions must also make preparations for continued development as soon as possible. The provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees must make unified plans for the development of agricultural middle schools based on production plans, supplement and allocate teachers, formulate teaching plans, and seize existing key schools to promptly summarize experiences, organize inspections and evaluations, and promote the development and improvement of agricultural middle schools. The in-depth and specific leadership of the commune Party committee is the fundamental guarantee for running agricultural middle schools well. The commune Party committee should make specific arrangements for this year's major development based on needs. Agricultural middle schools can enroll students not only in the fall, but also in the spring. Areas that have not yet established agricultural middle schools should establish them quickly; areas where agricultural middle schools are not enough should increase the number of schools and classes, and absorb as many senior primary school graduates who have not yet been enrolled as possible to study.

Agricultural middle schools are schools collectively run by the masses. They grow up among the masses. Therefore, to run agricultural middle schools well, the commune Party committee must rely on the masses. In fact, the school buildings, equipment, farm tools, etc. of agricultural middle schools in various regions are all strongly supported by the masses. In the process of establishing agricultural middle schools in various regions, many activists in running schools have emerged. They do not want remuneration and only fulfill their obligations. They are willing to run schools, are able to run schools, and will run the schools better and better. Precisely because the masses regard agricultural middle schools as their own schools, the commune Party committee needs to establish close ties with the masses, help the masses, support production, and serve the masses wholeheartedly. The deeper the mass base of agricultural middle schools is, the more it will help their own consolidation and improvement. This principle is already very clear.

Politics takes command, and ideology comes first. The teachers of agricultural middle schools have established lofty communist ambitions and want to contribute their strength to changing the "poor and blank" face of the countryside in this glorious position. They are determined to "be in the agricultural middle school, have their hearts in the agricultural middle school, be red in the agricultural middle school, and be expert in the agricultural middle school." As long as you have lofty ambitions and are determined, what are you afraid of not being able to achieve results? The outstanding achievements of agricultural middle schools are not the result of their political thought planting red flags and exerting full effort? The commune Party committee should further help them politically and improve them ideologically on this basis. The higher the political and ideological consciousness of the teachers, the more beneficial it is to improving the political and ideological consciousness of the students. Political and ideological education should be regularized, the school should seriously teach political classes, and the commune Party committee should regularly give political current affairs reports to students. Teachers and students should study Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought rooted, everything will be easy to handle, and agricultural middle schools will be easy to run.

Agricultural middle schools should rationally arrange teaching, productive labor, and scientific and technological activities. Agricultural middle schools are half-day schools. In terms of the requirements of cultural and scientific basic courses, they are certainly different from full-time ordinary middle schools. However, as long as teachers teach diligently and students study attentively, the main subjects of agricultural middle schools, such as Chinese and mathematics, can catch up with ordinary middle schools. The county and commune should organize teachers from ordinary middle schools to guide the teachers of nearby agricultural middle schools separately to form a guidance network. Teachers of agricultural middle schools can also participate in teaching activities in ordinary middle schools. Agricultural middle schools should constantly summarize experience, establish a normal educational order, and complete the teaching plan on time. Agricultural middle schools should establish schools in production and gradually achieve economic self-sufficiency in production. Therefore, the close integration of productive labor and teaching is an important task. The commune Party committee should effectively solve specific problems in production and regularly check the production situation. With surplus production, the school can be developed and run better and better. The production policy of many agricultural middle schools is based on high-yield cash crops and sideline production (handicrafts), with agriculture and sideline production proceeding simultaneously. Experience has proven that this policy is feasible. All regions can arrange productive labor according to their own actual conditions. Teachers and students of agricultural middle schools should also learn humbly, study in depth, combine teaching and productive labor, and fully conduct agricultural science and technology activities to become an important base for the commune to improve production technology.

Agricultural middle schools are new things that have emerged under the socialist education system in our country. They fully meet the needs of the broad masses of people in our country and the needs of our country to develop agriculture at a high speed. They have strong vitality. New seedlings need to be diligently cultivated in order to grow strong. Under the leadership of the Party, it is hoped that ordinary middle schools, universities, scientific and technological units, production units, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and various mass organizations will cultivate agricultural middle schools together, so that they can bloom with wonderful flowers and bear rich fruits.

### 又多又好地办农业中学

    又多又好地办农业中学
    经过了两年的努力，农业中学作为我国教育史上的一种全新的事物已经在农村站住脚跟了。这是一个很大的胜利。现在全国各地农村都在大办农业中学。农业中学发展和成长得这样快，并不是偶然的。人民公社的巩固发展和农业生产的继续跃进，迫切需要大量的技术人才，而广大农民群众在经济生活获得逐步改善的同时，对于文化革命，也有了进一步的要求。在这样形势下，广大人民热烈拥护党的“两条腿走路”的办学方针，既办全日制学校，也办业余学校和半日制学校。于是，一种完全新型的学校——农业中学，便应运而生了，并且很快地巩固起来了。农业中学是农业大跃进和人民公社的产物，也是贯彻党的教育方针的产物。
    两年时间，不算太长。可是，农业中学已经取得了很大的成就，培养出大批的学生，也锻炼了又红又专的教师。农业中学所取得的成就，是有着深远的意义的。从此可以希望，我们广大的农村在普遍地举办了初等教育、中等教育和业余教育之后，我们将在很短的时间内，培养出大批的初级建设人才来实现农业现代化，和供给人民公社办工业，办教育，办科学研究工作，办卫生事业和保育事业，办农林副牧渔各业的需要。这一切，将是向着消灭城乡差别，消灭工农差别，消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别的伟大目标，迈进了一步。然而，农业中学所具有的重要意义，并不是所有的人都认识得很清楚。有人说，农业中学不像个学校样子。试问，什么才像个样子呢？难道只有全日制学校才像个样子吗？我们党的“两条腿走路”的办学方针，就是要求办学有各种各样的形式，在最大的范围内动员群众的力量，用最快的速度培养人才。我们不但有以教学为主结合生产劳动的全日制学校的形式，还有以生产劳动为主结合进行学习的业余学校的形式，而且还有农业中学这种半工半读的半日制学校的形式。尽管办学的形式多种多样，它们的目的都是一个：培养有社会主义、共产主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。各类学校各有所长，都是为社会主义建设所需要的。只重视全日制学校，轻视业余的和半日制的学校的看法，实际上是只要一条腿走路，不要两条腿走路的思想。这不过是资产阶级的陈腐的教育观点作怪罢了。又有人认为，农业中学只是眼前有用，将来我国教育事业发展了，就不需要农业中学了。这种看法也是近视的。随着我国经济文化教育事业的高涨，农业中学将会逐渐巩固和提高，这是必然的趋势。农业中学的前途是无限广阔的。今天多办和办好农业中学，就可以为明天提高农业中学作准备。农业中学对于在农村中开展文化革命和技术革命所起的作用，是有目共睹的。它将来要发挥更大的作用，也更是可以肯定。
    农业中学当前的重大的任务是：要为公社的农林牧副渔的全面发展和农业现代化培养技术人才和管理人员，同时，农业中学也将为国家建设培养具有更高质量的人才作好准备，使有条件的青年继续提高。过去两年来，各地农业中学，经过整顿，得到了巩固和提高，成绩很大。我们就要在这个基础上，本着“积极提倡、大力发展、及时巩固、不断提高”的方针多办一些农业中学，进一步把农业中学办好。这是当前农村教育工作中迫切的任务。
    我国小学教育已经基本普及。今年全国将有大批高小毕业生，除了全日制中学吸收一部分以外，农业中学也可以吸收一部分。去年凡是办了农业中学的地区，都吸收了大批高小毕业生。现在，各地在办好已有的农业中学的同时，还要及早做好继续发展的准备工作。省委、地委、县委，要根据生产规划，对发展农业中学作出统一规划，补充和调配师资，制定教学计划，并抓住已有重点学校，及时总结经验，组织检查评比，推动农业中学的发展和提高。公社党委的深入具体的领导，是办好农业中学的根本保证。公社党委应该根据需要，作出今年大发展的具体安排。农业中学不仅秋季可以招生，春季也可以招生。凡是没有办起农业中学的地区，应当迅速举办；凡是农业中学办得不够的地区，应当增加校数和班数，尽可能吸收没有入学的高小毕业生学习。
    农业中学是群众集体举办的学校，它生长在群众中间，所以，公社党委要办好农业中学，必须依靠群众。事实上，各地农业中学的校舍、设备、农具，等等，都是群众大力支援的。各地在兴办农业中学中，涌现了许多办学的积极分子，他们不要报酬，只尽义务。他们愿意办学，能够办学，并且会把学校越办越好。正因为群众把农业中学当作自己的学校，公社党委更需要使农业中学同群众建立密切的联系，帮助群众，支援生产，全心全意为群众服务。农业中学的群众基础打得越深厚，就越有助于自己的巩固和提高。这个道理已经是很明白的了。
    政治挂帅，思想先行。农业中学的教师立下共产主义大志，要在这个光荣的岗位上，为改变农村“一穷二白”的面貌贡献出自己的力量。他们下决心“身在农中，心在农中，红在农中，专在农中。”只要立了大志，下了决心，什么事情还怕做不出成绩来吗？农业中学的卓越成就，不正是他们政治思想插红旗，鼓足干劲做出来的结果吗？公社党委就要在这个基础上，进一步从政治上帮助他们，从思想上提高他们。教师的政治思想觉悟越高，对提高学生的政治思想觉悟越有好处。政治思想教育要经常化，学校要认真上好政治课，公社党委要定期向学生作政治时事报告。教师和学生，都要学习毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想生了根，一切事情就好办了，农业中学也就好办了。
    农业中学要合理安排教学、生产劳动和科学技术活动。农业中学是半日制的学校，在文化科学基础课程的要求上，它当然不同于全日制的普通中学。但是，只要教师努力教，学生用心学，农业中学的主要学科，比如语文、数学，等等，是可以赶上普通中学的。县、公社应该组织普通中学的教师，分别辅导附近农业中学的教师，形成辅导网。农业中学的教师，也可以去普通中学参加教学活动。农业中学要经常总结经验，建立正常的教育秩序，按时完成教学计划。农业中学要在生产中建立学校，并在生产中逐步做到经济自给。所以，生产劳动同教学紧密结合是一项重要任务。公社党委要切实解决生产中的具体问题，并定期检查生产的情况。生产有余，就可以发展学校，把学校越办越好。许多农业中学的生产方针，是以高产经济作物和副业（手工业）为主，农业和副业同时并举。经验证明，这个方针是可行的。各地可以根据自己的实际情况来安排生产劳动。农业中学师生还应该虚心学习，深入钻研，结合教学和生产劳动，充分进行农业科学技术活动，成为公社的提高生产技术的重要基地。
    农业中学是在我国社会主义教育制度下出现的新生事物。它完全适应我国广大人民群众的需要，适应我国高速度发展农业的需要。它是有强大的生命力的。新生的幼芽，需要殷勤培植，才能成长茁壮。在党的领导下，希望普通中学、高等学校、科学技术单位、生产单位、共青团、妇联和各群众团体，一齐来培植农业中学，让它放奇葩，结硕果。
