Title: Absurd Excuse

Cuba's every measure to safeguard its independence and sovereignty has provoked Washington's crude interference. On March 11, US State Department spokesman Tally even threatened Cuba for buying arms from foreign countries for self-defense, saying it was an "arms race" that "would only create tension in the region (the Caribbean)." A few days ago, when the Cuban government and public opinion accused the United States of obstructing Cuba's purchase of arms from Belgium and using despicable means to create the "La Coubre" ship explosion, US Secretary of State Herter flew into a rage and flatly denied it. Now, Tally's threatening remarks further admit that the United States is the obstructer and opponent of Cuba's purchase of arms.

The US government, in order to find an excuse for intervention, has not hesitated to put itself in an extremely absurd situation. Cuba is an independent sovereign country, and it certainly has the right to trade with any country, including buying arms. The United States has no right to interfere at all. Moreover, the Cuban government relies on the donations of the people to buy arms from foreign countries in order to defend the revolution and defend independence. The Cuban government and people have not threatened any country, but they have been subjected to increasingly serious threats and interference from US imperialism. It is entirely legitimate for them to take all necessary measures to strengthen self-defense. What does this have in common with an "arms race"? Doesn't the United States constantly proclaim its history of independence? But people know that the United States received a lot of military assistance from France, the Netherlands, and Spain during the War of Independence. 90% of the weapons used in the first two and a half years of the War of Independence were shipped in from Europe, especially from France. So, can it be said that the American people at that time and the newly independent American government were also engaged in an "arms race"?

The US State Department is now openly opposing Cuba's "arms race" and putting this charge on Cuba. This is a great irony to the United States itself! If the United States is really against the arms race, then shouldn't the United States itself be the first to stop the arms race immediately? However, the opposite is true. The United States has been engaged in a large-scale arms race. Even after the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have taken the initiative to take practical actions to reduce their troops, the United States is still engaged in a frenzied arms expansion and war preparation. Not only that, but US imperialism also relies on its military power to threaten and invade others everywhere. American planes continue to bomb Cuban cities and villages, burning Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields. American armed forces conduct provocative military exercises in the Caribbean region, conducting blatant intimidation against the Cuban and Latin American people. Isn't it precisely the United States itself that is creating tension in the Caribbean region? However, according to the US State Department, it seems that the United States' invasion and threat to others will not create tension, while anyone who opposes the United States' aggression and threat and rises to defend their independence and security is "creating tension." What an absurd imperialist logic! There is an old Chinese saying, "Only the magistrate is allowed to set fires, while the common people are not allowed to light lamps." This refers to those tyrannical and unreasonable reactionary rulers. US imperialism goes even further than this. It not only sets fires to burn down other people's homes and does not allow others to take measures to protect themselves, but also wants to pin its crimes on others!

However, no matter what excuses the United States finds, its interference, sabotage, and threats against Cuba will only further expose its ferocious features and arouse more resolute resistance from the Cuban people. The unextinguished smoke of the sugarcane fields has ignited the raging fire of the Cuban people's shared hatred for the enemy; the explosion of the "La Coubre" ship has awakened the Cuban people's roar to strengthen self-defense. It is precisely the Cuban people who are unwilling to succumb to American threats, intimidation, and interference who have won the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in the world.

    荒唐的借口
    林木
    古巴采取每一个维护独立主权的措施，几乎都引起华盛顿的粗暴干涉。3月11日，美国国务院新闻发布官塔利竟对古巴为了自卫而向外国购买军火的事情进行威胁，说什么这是“军备竞赛”，“只会造成这个地区
  （加勒比海）的紧张局势”。几天以前，当古巴政府和舆论界指责美国阻挠古巴向比利时购买军火，并用卑鄙手段制造“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件的时候，美国国务卿赫脱暴跳如雷，矢口抵赖。现在，塔利的威胁言论，倒是进一步供认了美国是古巴购买军火的阻挠者和反对者。
    美国政府为了寻找干涉的借口，不惜使自己落到了极端荒谬的境地。古巴是一个独立的主权国家，它当然有权同任何国家进行贸易，包括购买军火，美国根本无权干涉。而且，古巴政府依靠人民的捐献，向外国购买军火，是为了保卫革命，保卫独立。古巴政府和人民并没有去威胁任何国家，他们却受到美帝国主义的日益严重的威胁和干涉。他们采取一切必要的措施，来加强自卫，这完全是正当的。这同“军备竞赛”有什么共同之点呢？美国不是口口声声宣扬它的独立的历史吗？可是人们都知道，美国在独立战争中就从法国、荷兰、西班牙得到了大量军事援助，独立战争中头两年半所使用的武器90％都是从欧洲特别是从法国运进来的。那么，难道能够说当时的美国人民和刚刚独立的美国政府也是进行“军备竞赛”吗？
    美国国务院现在公然出来反对古巴进行“军备竞赛”，把这个罪名加到古巴身上，这是对美国自己的莫大讽刺！如果美国真是反对军备竞赛的，那么，不是别人，首先是美国自己，难道不就应该立即停止军备竞赛吗？但是，事实正好相反，美国一直在进行大规模的军备竞赛，甚至在苏联和其他社会主义国家主动采取了裁减军队的实际行动之后，美国仍然在进行疯狂的扩军备战。不但这样，美帝国主义还依靠它的军事力量，到处威胁别人，侵略别人。美国的飞机不断地轰炸古巴的城市和乡村，烧毁古巴的糖厂和蔗田，美国武装力量在加勒比海地区进行挑衅性的军事演习，向古巴和拉丁美洲人民进行露骨的恐吓。难道制造加勒比海地区紧张局势的，不也恰恰是美国自己吗？但是，按照美国国务院的说法，美国侵略别人，威胁别人，似乎不会造成紧张局势，而谁要是反对美国的侵略和威胁，起来保卫自己的独立和安全，谁倒是“制造紧张局势”，这是多么荒唐的帝国主义的逻辑！中国有一句古话，“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”，这是指那些蛮横无理的反动统治者而说的。美帝国主义比这种情况还要进一步，它不但放火烧毁别人的家园，不许别人采取保卫自己的措施，而且还想把自己的罪状栽到别人头上！
    但是，美国不论寻找任何借口，它对古巴的干涉、破坏和威胁，只会进一步暴露它的凶神恶煞的真面目，引起古巴人民的更坚决的反抗。甘蔗园的不熄的浓烟，燃起了古巴人民同仇敌忾的烈火；“勒库布尔号”轮船的爆炸声，唤起了古巴人民加强自卫的怒吼。正是这样不愿屈服于美国的威胁、恫吓和干涉的古巴人民，博得了世界上一切爱好和平人民的同情和支持。
