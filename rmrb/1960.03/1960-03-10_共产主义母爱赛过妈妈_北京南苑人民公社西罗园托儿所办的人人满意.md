Communist Motherly Love Surpasses Mothers
The Xiluoyuan Nursery of the Nanyuan People's Commune in Beijing is Run to Everyone's Satisfaction

(Reported by our newspaper) The Xiluoyuan Nursery of the Nanyuan People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, after two years of effort, has achieved good hygiene, good education, good arrangement of children's lives, good learning and unity among childcare workers, good democratic management, and high satisfaction from children's parents.

Xiluoyuan's childcare work began in early 1956 when the advanced cooperative was established. Initially, it was a seasonal childcare group that operated during the busy farming season and disbanded during the slack season. After the people's commune was established in 1958, it became a year-round nursery due to the needs of production development and the demands of commune members. Currently, five childcare workers care for fifty-four children in spacious and sunny rooms equipped with necessary facilities such as tables, chairs, teacups, thermoses, running water, and various toys. Children entrusted here have never experienced falls or collisions, nor have they suffered from major illnesses, and all are lively and healthy. The nursery not only ensures the children's physical health and safety but also allows thirty mothers to participate in production with peace of mind.

When the nursery first opened, due to the recent establishment of the commune and limited resources, there were only two dilapidated rooms and a few bed boards, and the equipment was very incomplete. In this situation, Zhang Yulan, the director of the nursery, took the lead in temporarily lending her spacious house, tables, chairs, water tank, and wooden basin to the nursery. She also mobilized everyone to wash old cloths for use as handkerchiefs and installed running water using bamboo tubes. When the nursery expanded in 1958 and the rooms were insufficient and finding rooms was difficult, they, based on the spirit of diligence and frugality in running all undertakings, mobilized mothers and all childcare workers to pick up city bricks during their rest time and built nine new rooms themselves. During the deep plowing and wheat planting in 1958, the nursery implemented full-day care, and the children did not have enough quilts for sleeping, so they mobilized the mothers to bring out cotton and old quilts, and the team supplemented some linings, making a set of bedding for each child. Childcare workers and mothers also squeezed in time to make many toys. In this way, relying on the support of the broad masses, the commune and team spent little money, and the children had everything they needed for bedding, use, and play. In order to save the team's expenses and ensure the children ate well, the childcare workers also used their rest time to raise two pigs, two rabbits, and four chickens, and planted a vegetable garden.

In addition to arranging a comfortable living environment for the children, they carefully and patiently took care of every detail of the children's lives, including eating, drinking, dressing, and sleeping, with consideration in every aspect. In the winter of 1958, some children in the nursery contracted measles. In order to avoid infection and prevent the children from going home for treatment, the childcare workers took on the responsibility of consulting doctors and obtaining medicine. Li Shuyu, a commune member, had three children who contracted measles, and two were seriously ill and needed hospitalization. However, she was unable to manage everything alone, so the director Zhang Yulan rushed to the hospital late at night to register and handle the procedures for her, and accompanied them to the hospital. She also took the child left at home without care back to her own home and asked her daughter-in-law to breastfeed them. She also walked several miles to the hospital every day to deliver food to Li Shuyu. Usually, when the children's clothes were dirty or torn, they would take the initiative to mend and wash them. If they couldn't finish during the day, they would work overtime at night. When the weather turned cold and mothers of many children didn't have time to make cotton clothes, they would make the cotton clothes for them. In order to keep the children healthy and prevent illness, they also conscientiously implemented various hygiene regulations. Every day after the children entered the nursery, they had to check their bodies. Before meals and after using the toilet, they had to wash their hands with running water. Used handkerchiefs and face towels were boiled and disinfected. They washed the children's hair and cut their nails every week. In the summer, when it was hot, they bathed the children every day. In addition, one person was responsible for environmental sanitation, sweeping the house and yard three times a day, washing the children's bedding once every half month, washing the pillows once a week, and regularly wiping the kang mats and glass. Therefore, the indoors, yard, and children could always be kept clean. At the same time, a kindergarten cafeteria was established, making easily digestible and nutritious meals according to the children's tastes. They not only made it delicious but also made it look good, so the children wanted to eat it at first sight. They carefully observed the children's eating habits every time they ate, noting who ate more, who ate less, and who didn't eat well, and promptly checked the reasons. They also checked the children's stools after defecation. If they found indigestion, they would change the diet and give them more boiled water to drink. In order to prevent the children from getting sick, they also took the initiative to contact the nearby health center to regularly conduct health check-ups for the children, administer vaccinations, etc. Due to the frequent hygiene work and attention to the children's nutrition, the children were all healthy, and basically eliminated eye diseases and dysentery last year.

They divided the children into classes according to age. Children who could crawl and sit played on the kang, and colorful paper and small toys were hung on the walls to amuse them. Children who could walk were taught to play games, led to take walks, and taught to sing nursery rhymes, so that the children could receive a good education from an early age. The childcare workers clearly divided the work according to their strengths. One person was in charge of overall leadership and also took care of a class of children. One person was responsible for hygiene work, and the other three each took care of a class of children. Because the division of labor was clear, it was not only convenient to properly arrange the children's lives and develop their intelligence but also improved the efficiency of childcare. Now, each person can take care of an average of a dozen children. The children are clean and tidy, do not cry or make trouble, and have developed good living habits of eating and sleeping on time. In order to take good care of the children, they also often go deep into the fields or to the commune members' homes to solicit mothers' opinions and improve their work.

In their daily work, they arranged the work in the nursery based on the principle of benefiting production and facilitating mothers. For example, during the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the people's commune movement in 1958, mothers participated in production early and late, and sometimes even worked at night, so the nursery established a night shift system. Whenever the children were sent, someone was there to take care of them. Last year, during the rush planting of Chinese cabbage, the commune engaged in large-scale production cooperation. Mothers all went to work several miles away, and it was inconvenient for the children to breastfeed. Under the leadership and assistance of the Party branch, the nursery set up a construction site nursery, and all the children inside and outside the nursery who had no one to take care of were managed by the construction site nursery, so that all 303 women who should have been on duty participated in the labor, overfulfilling the task of planting vegetables. The mothers were very satisfied. They said, "With such a nursery, what is there to worry about?"

    共产主义母爱赛过妈妈
    北京南苑人民公社西罗园托儿所办的人人满意
    本报讯　北京市丰台区南苑人民公社西罗园托儿所，经过两年的努力，作到了卫生好，教育好，孩子生活安排好，保育人员学习好，团结好，民主管理好，孩子家长很满意。
    西罗园托儿工作是在1956年初成立高级社的时候开始的。最初是农忙办、农闲散的季节性托儿小组。1958年人民公社化后，随着生产发展的需要和社员的要求才转为常年托儿所。现在五个保教人员收有五十四个孩子，在宽敞向阳的房子里，有桌、凳、茶杯、暖壶、流动水等必要的设备，和各种各样的玩具。寄托在这里的孩子从来没有发生过摔着、碰着的事故，也没有发生过大的疾病，个个活泼健壮。托儿所不但保证了孩子身体健康和安全，同时使三十个妈妈安心地参加了生产。
    托儿所刚开办时，因为公社刚成立，家底薄，只有两间破房，几块床板，设备很不齐全。在这种情况下，托儿所所长张玉兰首先带头把自己住的宽敞房子、用的桌子、凳子以及水缸、木盆拿出来暂借给托儿所，并发动大家用旧布洗净当手帕，用竹筒安装了流动水。1958年托儿所扩大了，房子不够用，找房又困难，她们本着勤俭办一切事业的精神，发动妈妈和全体保育员利用休息时间去拣城砖，自己动手盖了九间新房。1958年深翻种麦时，托儿所搞全日托，孩子睡觉被子不够，就动员妈妈们拿出了棉花和旧被，队里补了一些里子，给孩子们每人做了一套被褥。保育员和妈妈们还挤时间做了不少玩具，就这样依靠广大群众的支持，社、队没花上几个钱，孩子铺的、盖的、使的、用的、玩的都有了。为了节省队里开支，使孩子吃得好，保育员们还利用休息时间喂养了两口猪，两只兔，四只鸡，种了一块菜园。
    她们除了为孩子安排舒适的生活环境外，对于孩子们的吃、喝、穿、睡每个生活细节，都细心、耐心照料，处处体贴。1958年冬季，所里有的孩子出了麻疹，为了避免传染，不让孩子回家去治疗，请医生、拿药的事，都由保育员担下来。社员李淑玉三个孩子都出了麻疹，两个病重需要住院，但是她一个人顾东顾不了西，所长张玉兰就连夜赶到医院替她挂号，办手续，陪送他们去医院，又把留在家里没人照料的孩子抱回自己家里，叫儿媳给喂奶。她还每天走几里路到医院给李淑玉送饭。平常孩子的衣服脏了、破了，她们就主动给缝补、洗涤，白天做不过来，晚上就打夜班，天气冷了，孩子多的妈妈来不及做棉衣，她们就代替妈妈把棉衣做好。为了使孩子健壮不闹病，她们还认真地执行各项卫生制度，每天孩子入所后，都要检查身体，饭前、便后一定用流动水给孩子洗手，用过的手帕、脸巾都用开水煮沸消毒，每周给孩子洗头、剪指甲。夏天天热，每天都给孩子洗澡。另外还有一个人负责环境卫生，一天三遍打扫屋院，每半月给孩子拆洗被褥一次，每周洗一次枕头，经常擦炕席，擦玻璃。因此，屋内、院内，孩子都能经常保持干净。同时所内还成立了幼儿食堂，根据孩子口味做容易消化又有营养的饭菜。不但做的好吃，还做的好看，孩子一见就想吃。每次吃饭时都仔细观察孩子进食情况，那个吃的多，那个吃的少，谁吃饭不香都记下来，及时检查原因。孩子大便后也进行检查，如发现消化不良就换饮食，多给开水喝。为了防止孩子生病，她们还主动和附近的卫生所联系，定期给孩子作健康检查，打预防针等，由于卫生工作经常，又注意了孩子的营养，所以孩子个个健壮，去年基本上消灭了眼病和痢疾。
    她们把孩子按年龄分成班，会爬、会坐的孩子就在炕上玩，墙上吊些彩色纸和小玩具逗引他们。会走的孩子就教他们做游戏，领他们出去散步，教他们唱小歌谣等，使孩子从小就受到好的教育。保教人员根据每人的特长，明确的分了工。有一人专管全面领导工作，并兼带一班孩子。一人负责卫生工作，其他三人各带一班孩子，由于分工明确，不但便于妥善地安排孩子生活，发展孩子的智慧，也提高了看孩子的效率，现在每个人平均可以看十几个小孩，孩子们都干净利落，不哭也不闹，并且养成了按时吃饭、睡觉的良好的生活习惯。为了带好孩子，她们还经常深入田间或到社员家中去征求妈妈的意见，改进工作。
    日常她们一切都从有利生产、便利妈妈出发，安排所内工作，如1958年农业生产大跃进和人民公社化运动中，妈妈们起早贪晚地参加生产，有时还搞夜战，托儿所就建立了夜间值班制度，什么时候送，什么时候有人看。去年抢种大白菜时，社里搞生产大协作，妈妈们都到几里地以外去劳动，孩子吃奶不方便，托儿所在党支部的领导和帮助下，搞了工地托儿站，把所内所外没人看管的孩子全部由工地托儿站管，使全队三百零三个应出勤的妇女都参加了劳动，超额完成了种菜任务，妈妈们很满意。她们说：“有了这样的托儿所，还有什么不放心。”
