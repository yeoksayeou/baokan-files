The National Conference on Cultural Relics and Museum Work has concluded victoriously. The conference fully affirmed the achievements made in the cause of cultural relics and museums over the past decade, summarized and exchanged the rich experiences accumulated over the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and, based on the high-speed development of the entire national construction cause, put forward the future guidelines and tasks, providing a clear direction for further promoting the development of the cause of cultural relics and museums.

The cause of cultural relics and museums is an integral part of the socialist cultural cause and a powerful tool for the Party to carry out propaganda and education and ideological struggle on the ideological front. Over the past decade, the achievements in the work of cultural relics and museums have been tremendous. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and under the leadership of local Party committees, adhering to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements, a new situation of vigorous development has emerged. This is mainly reflected in the fact that museums in various places have broken with conventions, going up mountains, down to the countryside, and down to factories and mines, holding large-scale mobile exhibitions to conduct patriotic, socialist, and communist education for the broad masses of people. In the process of publicizing the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, the masses have self-organized tens of thousands of exhibitions. This is a completely new type of small museum and exhibition hall with a clear political direction and realistic content. These halls are characterized by a wide range of content, diverse forms, vividness, flexibility, and remarkable effects. For example, a large number of exhibitions such as "Comparison of the Past and Present," "Ten Years of Achievements," "Technological Innovation," and "Three Decades" can all promptly cooperate with the central tasks, closely integrate with politics and production, improve the people's ideological awareness, inspire the people's labor enthusiasm, and promote advanced technologies and experiences. The masses say that it is an "important place to point the direction, learn technology, commend achievements, and praise the bright future." In terms of cultural relics work, mass cultural relics work has been widely carried out in the past two years, emancipating the mind, breaking superstitions, and holding training courses throughout the country to popularize cultural relics knowledge, widely collecting revolutionary cultural relics, and a large number of mass amateur cultural relics protection organizations and active elements in protecting cultural relics have emerged, and in some areas, mass amateur cultural relics excavation teams have also been organized. These living facts have powerfully refuted the fallacies of some bourgeois experts who believe that the cause of cultural relics and museums can only deal with the past, not the present, can only be run by experts, not by the masses, can only be done slowly, not quickly, and can only be done on a small scale, not on a large scale. This has made the cause of cultural relics and museums the cause of the broad masses of the people and has opened up a new path for future development. At present, various places, mainly communes and production teams, have also set up many exhibition rooms to publicize the nature of science and technology, some of which are called agricultural technology museums. Some people say: "If you want to learn to be versatile, take a walk in the museum." This kind of exhibition will play a huge role in promoting industrial and agricultural production and promoting technological innovation and technological revolution.

This conference proves that the process of continuous development and continuous improvement of the cause of cultural relics and museums over the past ten years is also the process of continuous struggle against bourgeois ideology and continuous victory under the leadership of the Party's line and Mao Zedong Thought.

Putting politics in command or "putting objects in command" is a fundamental issue in the cause of cultural relics and museums. The characteristic of the work of cultural relics and museums is to use objects as examples to illustrate the class struggle and production struggle of human society, so as to achieve the purpose of educating the broad masses of the people. Some people one-sidedly emphasize the importance of "objects," resulting in phenomena such as "listing cultural relics, listing phenomena," "collecting for the sake of collecting," and "protecting for the sake of protecting." These phenomena are all manifestations of "putting objects in command," which in essence is a reflection of bourgeois viewpoints.

In the display and exhibition of museums, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, and there must be a clear political orientation. For example, in the display of modern revolutionary history, it is necessary to highlight the red line of the Party's line and Mao Zedong Thought; in the historical display, it is necessary to highlight the red line of class struggle and the people being the creators of history. The red line is the issue of political orientation. However, political orientation must be combined with historical authenticity. Marxists do not allow any distortion of historical truth. We use the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism, that is, the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, to observe and study all historical phenomena in order to find out the laws of historical change and respect the development of the dialectics of history. Listing historical phenomena does not mean scientifically explaining history. The naturalistic display of what the museum has cannot show the true face of history. Political orientation is to require the expression of the most essential things in historical events, that is, the original appearance of history. Only in this way can the people be educated with correct historical knowledge and revolutionary spirit.

It must be pointed out here that our opposition to "putting objects in command" does not mean that it is not necessary to protect and preserve these objects. The rich historical and cultural heritage remaining on the ground and underground is the crystallization of the labor and wisdom of the working people of all dynasties, and the most vivid, concrete, and reliable material examples to illustrate the history of social development and the creation of the world by labor. Doing a good job in its protection and management is of great significance for studying the history of the motherland, carrying out revolutionary tradition education, historical materialism education, patriotic education, and creating a socialist and national new culture for the people. However, we are by no means "displaying for the sake of displaying" or "protecting for the sake of protecting." Therefore, we do not need and cannot preserve everything that has existed in history and display it. As long as we implement "key protection and key excavation" for important and valuable historical relics and sites, we can achieve the purpose of providing educational materials and enriching historical scientific research materials for the masses. However, since it is a key point, it must be resolutely protected. For example, the Yin Ruins in Anyang, Dunhuang, Yungang, and Longmen Grottoes are not only the treasures of Chinese history, but also rare historical sites in the world. It should be vigorously protected. We must oppose and prevent the phenomenon of neglecting important historical relics and allowing them to be destroyed.

This conference also proved that as long as any cause adheres to the mass line, vigorously carries out mass movements, it will develop more, faster, better, and more economically, and vice versa, it will inevitably be less, slower, worse, and more expensive, and deserted. The development of the museum cause in the past two years has exceeded more than eight times that of the previous eight years, which is the result of adhering to the mass line and vigorously carrying out mass movements. Not only that, but in order to improve the quality of cultural relics and museum work, we must also adopt the mass line method, concentrate the experiences created by the masses, and then persist in it. Since the Great Leap Forward, in terms of cultural relics work, the masses have been engaged in cultural relics protection, the masses have been engaged in excavation, and the masses have written excavation reports; in terms of museum work, the broad masses have broken with conventions and successfully applied folk songs, paintings, storytelling, handicrafts, etc., which they like to hear and see, to exhibitions, greatly enriching the forms of exhibitions, thus strengthening the ideology, combat effectiveness, and flexibility of exhibitions. All of these show a clear national style and national characteristics. This is the creative development of the cause of cultural relics and museums in our country, and it is also a sign that the cause of cultural relics and museums in our country has entered a new stage of development.

The people of our country are working with soaring enthusiasm to build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense. As an integral part of the cultural cause, the cause of cultural relics and museums must adapt to the requirements of the development of the national construction cause, actively develop, improve quality, and better serve politics and production. The new direction affirmed by the great development of the cause of cultural relics and museums in the past two years has opened up broad prospects for the development of the cause of cultural relics and museums. We believe that as long as we strengthen the Party's leadership, resolutely implement the Party's general line for building socialism, adhere to the Party's mass line, and cultural relics and museum workers continue to improve their political and ideological level and conscientiously study their business, the cause of cultural relics and museums will inevitably achieve new and greater achievements.

### 坚持政治挂帅，积极发展文物、博物馆事业

    坚持政治挂帅，积极发展文物、博物馆事业
    全国文物、博物馆工作会议胜利闭幕了。会议充分肯定了十年来文物、博物馆事业所取得的成绩，总结和交流了十年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来所累积的丰富经验，并且根据国家整个建设事业高速度发展的形势，提出了今后的方针任务，为进一步推动文物、博物馆事业的发展提出了明确的方向。
    文物、博物馆事业是社会主义文化事业的一个组成部分，是党在思想战线上进行宣传教育和理论斗争的有力工具。十年来，文物、博物馆工作的成绩是巨大的，特别是1958年以来在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在各地党委的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，出现了一个蓬勃发展的新局面。主要表现在，各地博物馆打破陈规，上山、下乡、下厂矿，大办流动展览，向广大群众进行爱国主义、社会主义、共产主义教育。在宣传总路线、生产大跃进和人民公社化的过程中，群众自办了成千上万的展览会。这是一种完全新型的具有鲜明政治方向和现实内容的小型博物馆、展览馆。这些馆的特点是内容广泛，形式多样，生动灵活，效果显著。如大量的“今昔对比”、“十年成就”、“技术革新”、“三个十年”等展览，都能够及时配合中心任务，密切结合政治、结合生产，提高了人民思想觉悟，鼓舞了人民劳动热情，推广了先进技术和经验。群众说它是一个“指方向、学技术、表扬成绩、歌颂光明的重要场所”。在文物工作方面，两年来广泛开展了群众性的文物工作，解放思想、破除迷信，全国各地大办训练班，普及文物知识，广泛征集革命文物，涌现出大量群众性业余的保护文物组织和保护文物的积极分子，并且在有些地区还组织了群众业余文物发掘队。这些活生生的事实，有力地驳斥了有些资产阶级专家认为文物、博物馆事业只能搞古，不能搞今，只能专家办，不能群众办，只能慢办，不能快办，只能小办，不能大办的谬论。从而使文物、博物馆事业成为广大人民群众自己的事业，并为今后的发展开拓了崭新的道路。目前各地主要是公社和生产队，还办了不少宣传科学技术性质的展览室，有的叫做农业技术博物馆，群众有的说：“要学多面手，博物馆里走一走”。这种展览对于促进工农业生产、促进技术革新技术革命将起巨大的作用。
    这次会议证明：文物、博物馆事业十年来不断发展和不断提高的过程，也正是在党的路线和毛泽东思想的领导下，与资产阶级思想不断斗争和不断取得胜利的过程。
    政治挂帅还是“实物挂帅”，是文物、博物馆事业中的一个根本问题。文物、博物馆工作的特点是用实物做例证来说明人类社会的阶级斗争和生产斗争，以达到教育广大人民的目的。有些人片面强调“实物”的重要，以致产生“罗列文物，罗列现象”，“为征集而征集”，“为保护而保护”等现象。这些现象都是“实物挂帅”的表现，实质上也就是资产阶级观点的反映。
    在博物馆的陈列和展览中必须坚持政治挂帅，必须要有明确的政治倾向性。比方说，在现代革命史的陈列中，就必须突出党的路线和毛泽东思想的红线；在历史陈列中，就必须突出阶级斗争和人民是历史的创造者的红线。红线就是政治倾向性的问题。但是政治倾向性又必须和历史真实性相结合。马克思主义者对历史的真实丝毫也不允许歪曲，我们用马克思列宁主义的观点，也就是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点来观察和研究一切历史现象，为的是找出历史变迁的规律，尊重历史的辩证法的发展。罗列历史现象，并不等于科学地说明了历史。博物馆有什么摆什么的自然主义陈列，并不能表现出历史的真实面貌。政治倾向性就是要求表现历史事物中最本质的东西，也即是历史的本来面目，只有这样才能以正确的历史知识和革命的精神教育人民。
    在这里必须指出，我们反对“实物挂帅”，并不是说不必保护和保存这些实物。遗存在地上、地下的丰富历史文化遗产，是历代劳动人民劳动智慧的结晶，是说明社会发展史劳动创造世界最生动具体的最可靠的实物例证。做好对它的保护和管理工作，对于研究祖国历史，向人民进行革命传统教育、历史唯物主义教育、爱国主义教育和创造社会主义的、民族的新文化，都具有重大意义。然而我们绝不是“为陈列而陈列”，“为保护而保护”。因此我们不必要也不可能把一切历史上存在过的东西都保存下来，并加以陈列。我们只要对重要的有价值的历史文物、遗迹实行“重点保护、重点发掘”，也就可以达到向人民群众提供教育材料和丰富历史科学研究资料的目的。但是既然做为重点，就要坚决保护，如安阳殷墟、敦煌、云岗、龙门石窟等不仅是我国历史的瑰宝，也是世界上的稀有历史遗迹。就应当大力保护。我们必须反对和防止忽视重要历史文物任其遭受破坏的现象。
    这次会议上还证明任何事业只要坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，就会多快好省，蓬勃发展，反之，必然要少慢差费、冷冷清清。两年来，博物馆事业的发展超过前八年的八倍多，正是坚持群众路线、大搞群众运动的结果。不仅如此，为了提高文物、博物馆工作的质量，也必须采取群众路线方法，把群众创造的经验集中起来再坚持下去。大跃进以来，在文物工作方面群众搞文物保护、群众搞发掘、群众写发掘报告；在博物馆工作方面，广大群众打破常规，把自己喜闻乐见的民歌、绘画、说唱、手工艺等，成功地运用到展览中去，大大地丰富了展览的形式，因而更加强了展览的思想性、战斗性、灵活性。所有这些都显示出鲜明的民族风格、民族特点。这是我国文物、博物馆事业的创造性发展，也是我国文物、博物馆事业进入发展新阶段的标志。
    我国的人民正在以冲天的干劲，要将我们国家建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大的社会主义强国。作为文化事业一个组成部分的文物、博物馆事业必须适应国家建设事业发展的要求，积极发展，提高质量，更好地为政治、为生产服务。两年来文物、博物馆事业大发展所肯定的新方向，已经为文物、博物馆事业开辟了广阔的发展前途。我们相信，只要加强党的领导，坚决贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线，坚持党的群众路线，文物、博物馆工作者在不断提高政治思想水平，认真钻研业务，文物、博物馆事业就必然会取得新的更大的成绩。
