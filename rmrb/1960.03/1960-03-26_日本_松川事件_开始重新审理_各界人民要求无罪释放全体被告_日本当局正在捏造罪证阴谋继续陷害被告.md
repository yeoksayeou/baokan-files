Japan's "Matsukawa Incident" Begins Retrial
    People from All Walks of Life Demand the Unconditional Release of All Defendants
    Japanese Authorities are Fabricating Evidence in a Conspiracy to Continue Framing the Defendants

(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) The "Matsukawa Incident," fabricated by the American and Japanese reactionaries ten years ago to persecute the Japanese workers' movement, began its retrial at the Sendai High Court on the 21st. The 57 lawyers of the defendant's defense team, along with the 17 defendants, waged a struggle in court, strongly demanding an early verdict of not guilty for all defendants. In the square in front of the courthouse, more than 700 people, including the Sendai "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasures Council, union members, and the "Matsukawa Incident" Truth Investigation Group, held a rally demanding the unconditional release of all defendants.

The defendant's defense team strongly demanded the release of the "Suwa Record," which proves the defendants' innocence. This record refers to the labor-management dispute negotiation records between Suwa, the section chief of the "Toshiba Matsukawa Factory," and workers like Saburo Sugiura, who was later falsely accused as a defendant in the "Matsukawa Incident," on the eve of the "Matsukawa Incident" where American and Japanese reactionaries fabricated a train derailment in August 1949. The contents of this record completely prove that the defendants could not have been holding a meeting to plot the "overturning of the train" at the same time, thereby completely overturning the so-called "evidence" that the Japanese judicial authorities used in the first and second trials to falsely accuse the 17 defendants of "conspiring to overturn the train." The Japanese reactionary authorities concealed this record, which was extremely unfavorable to them, for nine years until it was exposed by the Japanese people in November 1958.

Chief defense lawyer Tatsuo Okabayashi pointed out that the trial work of the "Matsukawa Incident" has taken ten years and several months. The reason for such a long delay is that the judicial authorities hid the "Suwa Record" evidence. He said that the defendant's defense team demanded the release of this record, which proves the defendants' innocence.

The "Matsukawa Incident" was a political conspiracy by American and Japanese reactionaries to suppress the Japanese trade union movement in 1949 in connection with the derailment of a train near Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture. Under the resolute struggle of the Japanese people, the Japanese Supreme Court was forced to return the "Matsukawa Incident" to the Sendai High Court, which was conducting the second trial, for retrial last August. Prior to this, all 17 defendants who had been sentenced had been released on bail. Currently, the Japanese people are fighting to force the judicial authorities to declare all defendants not guilty. The Japanese authorities are doing everything possible to fabricate new "evidence" in an attempt to continue framing the innocent defendants.

### 日本“松川事件”开始重新审理  各界人民要求无罪释放全体被告  日本当局正在捏造罪证阴谋继续陷害被告

    日本“松川事件”开始重新审理
    各界人民要求无罪释放全体被告
    日本当局正在捏造罪证阴谋继续陷害被告
    本报综合报道　十年以前美日反动派为迫害日本工人运动而捏造出来的“松川事件”，21日在仙台高等裁判所开始重新审判。被告辩护律师团的五十七名律师和十七名被告一起在法庭上展开斗争，他们强烈要求及早宣判全体被告无罪。在裁判所前面的广场上，仙台“松川事件”对策协议会、工会会员以及“松川事件”真相调查团共七百多人举行大会，要求无罪释放全体被告。
    被告辩护律师团强烈要求公布证明被告无罪的“诹访记录”，这个记录是指1949年8月美日反动派捏造火车出轨的“松川事件”前夕，“东芝松川工场”的课长诹访和后来被诬陷为“松川事件”的被告杉浦三郎等工人举行劳资争议的谈判记录。这份记录内容完全证明被告不可能在同一个时间开会策划“颠覆列车”，从而彻底推翻了日本司法当局在第一审和第二审中诬告十七名被告“共谋颠覆列车”的所谓“证据”。日本反动当局把这份对它十分不利的记录，隐瞒了九年之久，直到1958年11月，才被日本人民揭发出来。
    主任辩护律师冈林辰雄指出，“松川事件”的审判工作已经用了十年零几个月的时间，所以拖得这样长，是由于司法当局隐藏了“诹访记录”的证据。他说，被告辩护律师团要求公开这份证明被告无罪的记录。
    “松川事件”是美日反动派在1949年就一辆火车在福岛县松川车站附近出轨事件策划的镇压日本工会运动的政治阴谋。在日本人民的坚决斗争下，日本最高裁判所被迫在去年8月把“松川事件”发回进行第二审的仙台高等裁判所重新审理。在这以前，被判刑的十七名被告已全部保释出狱。目前日本人民正在为迫使司法当局宣判全体被告无罪而奋斗。而日本当局正在千方百计地捏造新“证据”，企图继续陷害无辜的被告。
