Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 15th: Ho Chi Minh pointed out at the Vietnam Youth Activists Conference that Vietnamese youth should become new people in building a new society.
Pham Van Dong instructed the youth to live and work with a communist spirit.
Nguyen Lam called on the youth to have great ambitions and do great things, and to work selflessly for the interests of the collective.

The First Congress of Socialist Labor Youth Activists in North Vietnam solemnly opened in Hanoi this morning.

More than 600 young labor heroes, model workers, and advanced producers representing more than 100,000 young activists from all over North Vietnam gathered together and solemnly declared: They will always be at the forefront, making greater contributions to socialist construction and the cause of unifying the motherland, enthusiastically launching competitions, and resolutely striving to complete the national plan. The conference will commend their achievements, summarize their experiences, and push the patriotic competition movement of the youth in the North to a new climax.

Premier Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the Labor Party Central Committee and the government, extended warm congratulations to the conference, and praised the selfless labor and creative spirit of the young activists. He said that our society is a large garden, and young activists are the most beautiful flowers in the garden. This marks the superiority of the socialist system. These flowers could not appear in South Vietnam and capitalist countries. He said that the emergence of more than 100,000 young activists in the North shows the will of the Vietnamese people to build socialism, which is a decisive force in the cause of national unification.

Premier Pham Van Dong encouraged the representatives to the conference to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, make further efforts to launch competitions, always play a leading role, and strive to overfulfill the 1960 plan. They must work hard to study culture, science, and technology, and become socialist builders who are both red and expert. He also instructed the youth to establish a new style, live and work with a communist spirit, and achieve good study, good work, good thinking, and good labor discipline.

Next, Nguyen Lam, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League, delivered a report to the conference. Nguyen Lam outlined the achievements made in North Vietnam in 1959 and the contributions of the youth. When talking about the tasks for 1960, he called on the youth to establish a clear class viewpoint and the spirit of selfless labor for the interests of the collective; to have great ambitions and do great things, and to follow Chairman Ho Chi Minh's teachings of "diligence, thrift, integrity, and impartiality, and great public spirit." He finally assured the Labor Party Central Committee on behalf of the conference that the national youth league members and youth are determined to study hard, work bravely, give play to labor creativity, strive to overcome all difficulties, and resolutely struggle for the great cause of the motherland.

Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Le Thanh Nghi, member of the Political Bureau of the Labor Party Central Committee and Minister of Industry, Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Central Committee and Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and Nguyen Van Tao, Director of the National Competition Committee, attended today's meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 17th: President Ho Chi Minh attended the First Congress of Socialist Labor Youth Activists in North Vietnam today. He called on the more than 600 young representatives attending the conference to create even more outstanding achievements as a gift to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Third National Congress of the Labor Party.

In his speech, President Ho Chi Minh praised the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese youth for the liberation of the motherland and for the revolutionary cause, as well as the great contributions they have made in socialist construction since the restoration of peace. When talking about the current tasks of the youth in North Vietnam, he instructed the rural youth to actively participate in consolidating and developing mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and to work actively to comprehensively and overfulfill the production tasks of early and late rice crops; the youth working in factories and construction sites should follow the slogan of "more, better, faster, and more economical," and compete to increase production, improve product quality, and reduce production costs; the youth in all industries and departments must ensure the overfulfillment of this year's national plan and prepare for the five-year plan. President Ho Chi Minh quoted Marx as saying that under the socialist system, one day is equal to twenty years. He said that the people and youth of the Soviet Union, China, and Korea are turning this sentence into reality. He said that our people, especially our youth, must learn from and catch up with the people and youth of fraternal countries.

President Ho Chi Minh told the youth that they must realize that only under the socialist system can the strength and wisdom of the people and the youth be fully developed, so that they can become new people in building a new society. President Ho Chi Minh encouraged the youth to cultivate revolutionary qualities, to be humble, united and friendly, and to promote collectivism; the advanced must help the backward, and the backward must catch up with the advanced, and build the country with diligence and thrift; resolutely oppose individualism, selfishness, arrogance, complacency, greed for fame and gain, contempt for ordinary work, corruption and waste, etc.; must study hard and constantly improve political, cultural, and technical levels to serve the motherland and the people.

More than 600 young activists expressed their gratitude for President Ho Chi Minh's earnest teachings with warm cheers and lasting applause.
