　　Another high tide—a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution—is surging on the land of our motherland. In a matter of days, even ten days or so, the production technology of many enterprises has become quite different. New equipment has replaced old equipment, and mechanization and semi-mechanization have replaced manual labor. Individual automatic machine tools have formed automatic production lines. Each step forward here opens up a broader path for continued leaps in production.

　　However, new situations always bring new problems. The conversion of the acidic open-hearth furnace into a hot-blast alkaline open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is only an equipment reform in the ironmaking process of steelmaking production. On the one hand, it provides favorable conditions in terms of material equipment for improving desulfurization efficiency and improving steel quality. On the other hand, it has also brought about many new problems, such as workers not being familiar with the new equipment, short furnace life, and low iron output.

　　Faced with new problems, what attitude should be adopted? Chongqing Iron and Steel Company adopted the attitude of revolutionaries. They planted one hundred and eighty-nine "experimental plots," exposing contradictions and resolving contradictions one by one. In more than twenty days, they solved seventy-two of the company's ninety-one major key problems. This changed from subjective lagging behind objective to subjective being consistent with objective, from thinking lagging behind the situation to thinking adapting to the situation, and promoted the development of the situation.

　　Planting "experimental plots" is a leadership method advocated by our Party and Chairman Mao of "breaking through at one point to promote the overall situation," and is a great creation of applying Marxist epistemology to practical work. Knowledge comes from practice. Through practice, perceptual knowledge is obtained, experience is summarized, and it is elevated to rational knowledge, which is then promoted. Planting "experimental plots" is a good way to gain rich experience from practice. In the past two years, thousands upon thousands of "experimental plots" on the industrial, agricultural, and commercial fronts have summarized many good experiences, which have guided more general practice. The leadership method of planting "experimental plots" has also been mastered by more and more comrades engaged in leadership work. When the situation has new developments, and a large number of new problems that have never been encountered before appear in front of us, in order to adapt our thinking to the development of the situation, grasp new problems, solve new problems, and promote the situation to develop in a better direction, we must plant "experimental plots."

    在新形势面前
    吴滤
    又一个高潮——技术革新和技术革命的高潮，澎湃在我们祖国的大地上。几十天、甚至十几天的时间，许多企业的生产技术面貌已经大不相同了，新的设备代替了旧的设备，机械化和半机械化代替了手工劳动，单个的自动机床组成了生产自动线。这里的每一步前进，都为生产继续跃进开拓了更加宽阔的道路。
    然而，新的形势总会带来新的问题。重庆钢铁公司炼钢车间把酸性化铁炉改成热风碱性化铁炉，只是炼钢生产中化铁这一道工序的设备改革，它一方面为提高脱硫效率、提高钢的质量提供了物质设备上的有利条件；另一方面也带来了不少新的问题，例如工人一时还不熟悉新的设备，炉子寿命短，出铁率低等等。
    面对新问题，应当采取什么态度呢？重庆钢铁公司采取了革命者的态度。他们种下了一百八十九块“试验田”，逐个地揭露矛盾，解决矛盾，二十多天中把全公司九十一个重大关键解决了七十二个。这就从主观落后于客观变成主观同客观一致，从思想落后于形势变成思想适应于形势，并且推动了形势的发展。
    种“试验田”，是我们党和毛主席所倡导的“突破一点，推动全面”的领导方法，是把马克思主义的认识论运用于实际工作的一项伟大创造。认识来源于实践，经过实践，获得感性知识，总结经验，提升到理性知识，再加以推广。种“试验田”，是从实践中获得丰富经验的好办法。两年来，在工业、农业、商业等各个战线千千万万块“试验田”里，总结出许许多多的好经验，指导了更普遍的实践。种“试验田”的领导方法，也已经被愈来愈多的做领导工作的同志掌握了。当形势有了新的发展，大量从来没有接触过的新问题出现在我们面前的时候，要使思想适应于形势的发展，抓住新问题，解决新问题，推动形势朝更好的方向发展，就要去种“试验田”。
