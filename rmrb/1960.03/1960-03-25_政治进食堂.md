	The current rural situation is very good, and the masses are highly motivated. Under these circumstances, leaders at all levels need to care more about the lives of the masses. Where is the key to improving living conditions? The experiences of various regions in arranging the lives of the masses, published in this newspaper in recent days, prove that the focus should be on running public canteens well.

	How to run the canteens well? Where is the key to running the canteens well? Hebei Province answered this question with a clear slogan: "Politics enters the canteen, and the Party Secretary goes to the kitchen." Under this slogan, Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province went to the canteens, and wherever the Secretary went, the canteen quickly changed. The result of focusing on canteens is that more than 10,000 third-class canteens in the province have been upgraded to first and second-class canteens. These canteens have achieved diversification of food and the commune members are eating their fill and eating well.

	"Politics enters the canteen, and the Party Secretary goes to the kitchen" is an event of great political significance. How are your canteens doing? Has the Secretary gone to the canteen?

    政治进食堂
    目前农村形势非常好，群众干劲很足，在这种情况下，各级领导就更需要关心群众生活。搞好生活的关键在哪里？这几天本报连续发表各地有关安排群众生活的经验证明，要以办好公共食堂为重点。
    怎样办好食堂？办好食堂的关键又在哪里？河北省以鲜明的口号：“政治进食堂，书记下伙房”回答了这个问题。在这个口号下，河北全省各级党委纷纷下到食堂，书记所到之处，食堂很快就变了样。大抓食堂的结果是：全省已有一万多个三类食堂，提高到一、二类食堂，这些食堂做到了饭菜多样化，社员吃得饱吃得好。
    “政治进食堂，书记下伙房”，这是一项具有重大政治意义的事件。你们那里的食堂办得怎么样？书记是不是下到了食堂？
