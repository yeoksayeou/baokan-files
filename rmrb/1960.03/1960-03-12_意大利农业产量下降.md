    Decline in Italian Agricultural Output
    Italy's wheat production in 1959 decreased by 13.8% compared to 1958, barley decreased by 5.8%, and rice decreased by 3.5%.
    According to statistics, based on the general reduction of grain sowing area in various regions of Italy by 5% to 10% in 1958, the sowing area was further reduced in 1959.
    Due to the bankruptcy of a large number of small and medium-sized farmers, as many as 600,000 farmers flowed into the cities in 1959.

    意大利农业产量下降
    意大利小麦产量1959年比1958年减少了13．8％，大麦减少了5．8％，大米减少了3．5％。
    据统计，在1958年意大利各区的谷物播种面积普遍减少5％到10％的基础上，1959年播种面积又进一步削减。
    由于大批中小农民破产，1959年流入城市的农民就达六十万人。
