A Peaceful and Friendly Visit

    Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Khrushchev, visited India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan from February 10th to March 5th. During this visit, Comrade Khrushchev held friendly talks with Prime Minister Nehru, Prime Minister Ne Win, President Sukarno, and Prime Minister Daoud, respectively, on major issues in the international situation and issues of common concern in bilateral relations. They expressed a common desire to ease international tensions, achieve comprehensive and complete disarmament, and prohibit the use and testing of nuclear weapons, and unanimously hoped that the upcoming summit meeting would achieve positive results. At the same time, they reiterated in joint statements and communiqués that they would further promote friendly and cooperative relations with each other on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. In order to develop such friendly cooperation, the Soviet Union and India signed an agreement to use a Soviet loan of 1.5 billion rubles to build major projects to be included in India's Third Five-Year Plan, as well as agreements on cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation; the Soviet Union and Burma reached an agreement to sign a cultural agreement in the near future; the Soviet Union and Indonesia signed a second general agreement on economic and technological cooperation and a cultural cooperation agreement, and reached an agreement on a Soviet loan of 250 million U.S. dollars to help Indonesia develop its economy; the Soviet Union and Afghanistan also signed a cultural agreement. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the four Southeast Asian countries was a peaceful and friendly visit, and therefore received a warm welcome from the people of India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan wherever he went. The Chinese people are delighted to see the success of Comrade Khrushchev's trip to Southeast Asia, and are also delighted to see that the friendly relations between our great ally, the Soviet Union, and our friendly countries—India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan—have been further developed as a result of Comrade Khrushchev's visit.
    Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the four countries is of great significance for supporting the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of the East and the struggle against imperialist aggression. In his many speeches during the visit, Comrade Khrushchev sternly condemned the colonialists for their plunder and enslavement of Eastern countries. He pointed out that the anti-colonialist struggle is not over. Colonialists will not automatically abandon their positions, and they will use all their strength to maintain their rule. Organizing military-political blocs is a manifestation of collective colonialism. The conspiracies carried out by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization against Indonesia, Cambodia, and Laos are powerful proof. When talking about the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the revival of Japanese militarism, Comrade Khrushchev particularly emphasized that "this is a very dangerous trick." He said: "What is the purpose of the American troops staying in Japan? I don't think it is to prevent typhoons that sometimes rage in this area, but its spearhead is primarily directed at the People's China and the Soviet Union." "What is the Japanese government planning to continue to maintain foreign military bases on its territory and greatly expand its armed forces for? Do the Japanese ruling circles want to bring out the miraculous plans in their pockets again? Do they really think that the people of all countries have forgotten the aggressive actions of the Japanese militarists who tried to enslave the people of East Asia not long ago?" Comrade Khrushchev pointed out with full confidence, "The death knell of colonialism has sounded. Hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have risen to greet a new life and strive for national independence and the right to develop national independence. The tide of national liberation movements is getting higher and higher." "The day is not far off when the people of all countries will finally break free from the shameful shackles of colonialism." Comrade Khrushchev gave a high evaluation of the significance of the anti-colonialist struggle, and he pointed out that the issue of eliminating colonialism and the issue of maintaining world peace are closely linked. He said: "The sooner the colonialist countries lose their colonies, the sooner the colonialists no longer have the possibility of exploiting and oppressing the people of other countries, the sooner world peace can be established." Comrade Khrushchev clearly expressed the great sympathy and support of socialist countries for the anti-colonialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said, "Following Lenin's instructions, we have always and will always unswervingly and resolutely advocate that the people of all countries free themselves from the enslavement of colonialism." Precisely because of this, Comrade Khrushchev repeatedly emphasized during this visit that the Soviet people fully support the efforts of the people of India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan to develop their national economies and overcome poverty and backwardness. In Indonesia, Comrade Khrushchev reiterated that the Soviet government fully supports Indonesia's sovereignty over West Irian and its demands. He announced that in this just struggle, the Soviet people are completely on the side of the Indonesian people. It is very clear that the Soviet Union's solemn declaration against colonialism and imperialist aggression is a great encouragement and support to all people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for and maintaining independence, and at the same time a serious blow to colonialism and imperialism.
    Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the four Southeast Asian countries once again fully demonstrated the peaceful foreign policy of the socialist camp and their sincere desire to promote peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. Socialist countries have always unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy, insisting that the people of all countries practice peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, equality and mutual benefit. The socialist camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and maintain world peace. Especially in the recent period, the Soviet Union has taken a series of peaceful actions and initiatives: Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, the Soviet government's proposal for comprehensive and complete disarmament, the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to unilaterally reduce armed forces by another 1.2 million men, and the Soviet Union's initiative to convene an East-West summit meeting have all been warmly welcomed by the people of the world. Now, we are equally pleased to see that these peaceful actions and initiatives of the Soviet Union have also been approved and supported by India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan. This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the cause of world peace.
    The peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries is particularly evident in their economic and cultural relations with nationally independent countries. Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the four Southeast Asian countries provided a model of genuine international cooperation. The economic and cultural agreements signed between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan clearly show that the economic and cultural cooperation between socialist countries and these countries is entirely out of a desire to help these countries develop their national economies and improve the living standards of their people. This is in sharp contrast to imperialism's practice of aggression in the name of "aid." Comrade Khrushchev pointed out, "In the world, there are two different attitudes towards the issue of aiding economically underdeveloped countries. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries are striving to make our economic and technological cooperation with these countries promote the accelerated development of former colonies and semi-colonies, and are striving to make this cooperation strengthen their national independence. But in the West, some people use their 'aid' as a tool to promote neo-colonialist policies, as a tool to guarantee the interests of monopoly capital and to deepen the political division of the world into hostile blocs." He also pointed out, "Capitalist countries follow the laws of their society—'If you don't cheat, you can't sell it,' in other words, helping the weak today is so that the weak will come back to ask for help tomorrow. It just goes on and on endlessly. This is not called aid, this is an attempt to tie your hands and feet and enslave you, to turn this or that country into an object of exploitation for one country or some people." In contrast, the Soviet Union has consistently helped the people of all countries who have overthrown colonial rule to completely free themselves from all the shackles of subordination, eliminate economic backwardness, and achieve social progress and economic prosperity. The Soviet Union has already given these countries sincere assistance in the past. The Bhilai Steel Plant in India, built with Soviet assistance and producing one million tons of steel per year, is a prominent example. This time, the Soviet Union has provided India and Indonesia with huge loans for industrial development. All these facts will undoubtedly make more and more people in Southeast Asia see more clearly the peaceful policy pursued by socialist countries. The Indonesian "Eastern Star" wrote, "The Soviet Union's policy of providing economic assistance to other countries marks a new phenomenon in history: this assistance not only does not carry any political conditions, but also provides preferential terms." It believes that "this Soviet policy gives concrete content to the policy of peaceful coexistence."
    Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the four Southeast Asian countries further consolidated and developed the unity and cooperation between socialist countries and nationally independent countries. It vividly shows that the friendly relations between socialist countries and nationally independent countries have a deep foundation, and that this friendly relationship not only fully conforms to the common interests of both sides, but also is an important factor in promoting the cause of world peace. We believe that no matter how the imperialists slander, obstruct, and sabotage, the people of socialist countries and the people of nationally independent countries will make continuous efforts to consolidate and develop friendship with each other, thereby making new contributions to the cause of world peace and international cooperation.

    和平友好的访问
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志，从2月10日到3月5日，访问了印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗四个国家。在这次访问中，赫鲁晓夫同志先后同尼赫鲁总理、奈温总理、苏加诺总统和达乌德首相，就国际局势中的重大问题和双方关系中共同关心的问题，进行了友好的会谈。他们表示了对于缓和国际紧张局势、全面彻底裁军、禁止使用和试验核武器的共同愿望，并且一致希望即将举行的最高级会议取得积极的结果。同时，他们在共同声明和公报中都重申，要在和平共处的原则下，进一步促进彼此之间的友好合作关系。为了发展这种友好合作，苏联和印度之间签订了利用苏联十五亿卢布贷款来兴建将列入印度第三个五年计划的大工程项目的协定和文化科学技术的协定；苏联和缅甸达成了在最近将来签订文化协定的协议；苏联和印度尼西亚之间签订了第二个经济和技术合作总协定、文化合作协定，达成苏联贷款二亿五千万美元帮助印度尼西亚发展经济的协议；苏联和阿富汗也签订了文化协定。赫鲁晓夫同志对东南亚四国的访问，是一次和平友好的访问，因而所到之处受到了印度人民、缅甸人民、印度尼西亚人民和阿富汗人民的热烈欢迎。中国人民高兴地看到赫鲁晓夫同志东南亚之行的成功，也高兴地看到我们的伟大盟邦苏联同我们的友邦——印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗四国的友好关系，由于赫鲁晓夫同志的这次访问而获得进一步的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的四国之行，对于支持东方各国人民的反殖民主义斗争和反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，具有重大的意义。赫鲁晓夫同志在访问中的多次讲话中，严正地斥责了殖民主义者对东方国家的掠夺和奴役。他指出：反殖民主义的斗争还没有结束。殖民主义者不会自动放弃阵地，他们将用一切力量来保持自己的统治。组织军事政治集团，就是集体的殖民主义的一种表现形式。东南亚条约组织对印度尼西亚、柬埔寨和老挝所进行的阴谋活动，就是有力的证明。赫鲁晓夫同志在谈到日美军事同盟条约的签订和日本军国主义复活的时候，特别强调指出“这是一个很危险的把戏”。他说：“美国军队留在日本的目的何在？我想不是为了防止有时在这个地区肆虐的台风，而其矛头首先是指向人民中国和苏联。”“日本政府打算继续保持外国在它的领土上的军事基地和大大扩充它的武装部队，是为了什么呢？日本统治集团是不是想再把囊中的神妙的计划搬出来呢？莫非他们当真认为，各国人民已经忘却了不久以前还企图奴役东亚人民的日本军国主义者的侵略行动吗？”赫鲁晓夫同志满怀信心地指出，“殖民主义的丧钟响了，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的千千万万人民已经起来迎接新的生活，争取民族独立和民族独立发展的权利。民族解放运动的浪潮越来越高。”“各国人民最后挣脱殖民主义可耻的枷锁的日子，已经不远了。”赫鲁晓夫同志对反殖民主义斗争的意义给予很高的评价，他指出消灭殖民主义的问题和维护世界和平的问题是紧密联系着的。他说：“殖民主义国家丧失殖民地、殖民主义者不再有剥削和压迫他国人民的可能的时刻越快到来，世界和平就能够越快地确立”。赫鲁晓夫同志明确地表达了社会主义国家对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反殖民主义斗争的极大同情和支持。他说，“我们遵循列宁的遗训，过去和将来都始终不渝地坚决主张各国人民摆脱殖民主义的奴役。”正因为这样，赫鲁晓夫同志在这次访问中，一再强调苏联人民完全赞助印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗人民为发展本国经济和克服贫困落后而作的努力。在印度尼西亚，赫鲁晓夫同志重申苏联政府完全支持印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权和要求。他宣布，在这一正义斗争中，苏联人民是完全站在印度尼西亚人民一边的。很显然，苏联的这种反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义侵略的庄严的声明，是对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一切争取和维护独立的人民的极大鼓舞和支持，同时也是对于殖民主义和帝国主义的严重打击。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的东南亚四国之行，又一次充分地表现了社会主义阵营各国的和平外交政策和它们促进不同社会制度国家的和平共处的真诚愿望。社会主义各国始终不渝地奉行和平外交政策，坚持主张各国人民在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、平等互利的基础上实行和平共处和友好合作。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，为了缓和国际紧张局势，维护世界和平，作了不屈不挠的努力。特别是最近一个时期，苏联采取了一系列和平行动和倡议：赫鲁晓夫同志的访问美国，苏联政府提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，苏联最高苏维埃关于再次单方面裁减武装部队一百二十万人的决定，以及苏联关于召开东西方最高级会议的倡议，都受到全世界人民的热烈欢迎。现在，我们同样高兴地看到，苏联的这些和平行动和倡议，又得到印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗的赞同和支持。这无疑地将对世界和平事业产生积极的影响。
    社会主义各国的和平外交政策，特别明显地表现在它们同民族独立国家的经济与文化关系上。赫鲁晓夫同志的东南亚四国之行，提供了真正的国际合作的范例。苏联和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗所签订的经济和文化协定清楚地表明，社会主义国家同这些国家的经济和文化合作，完全是出于帮助这些国家发展民族经济和提高人民生活水平的愿望。这同帝国主义借“援助”之名，行侵略之实，形成尖锐的对照。赫鲁晓夫同志指出，“在世界上，对待援助经济上不发达的国家的问题，有两种不同的态度。苏联和其他社会主义国家竭力使我们同这些国家的经济技术合作促进过去的殖民地半殖民地加速发展，竭力使这种合作加强它们的民族独立。而在西方却有人利用自己的‘援助’作为推行新殖民主义政策的工具，作为保证垄断资本的利益和加深世界在政治上分裂成敌对集团的工具。”他还指出，“资本主义国家遵循着他们社会的法则——‘不欺骗，就卖不出去’，换句话说，今天帮助弱者是为了使弱者明天还来请求帮助。就是这样无止境地下去。这不叫援助，这是企图束缚住你的手脚而进行奴役，是把这个或那个国家变成一国或某些人的剥削对象。”与此相反，苏联则是一贯地帮助推翻了殖民主义统治的各国人民，使他们彻底摆脱从属地位的一切束缚，消灭经济落后，获得社会进步和经济繁荣。苏联过去已经给予这些国家以真诚的援助。苏联帮助印度建设的年产一百万吨钢的比莱钢铁厂就是一个突出的事例。这次苏联又向印度和印度尼西亚提供了发展工业的巨额贷款。所有这些事实，无疑会使东南亚各国越来越多的人更加看清社会主义国家所奉行的和平政策。印度尼西亚“东星报”写道，“苏联对其他国家给予经济援助的政策标志着历史上的一种新现象：这种援助不仅不带有任何政治条件，而且还提供优惠条件。”它认为，“苏联这种政策赋予了和平共处政策以具体内容”。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的东南亚四国之行，进一步巩固和发展了社会主义国家同民族独立国家的团结合作。它生动地表明，社会主义国家和民族独立国家之间的友好关系是有着深厚的基础的，这种友好关系不但完全符合双方的共同利益，而且是促进世界和平事业的一个重要的因素。我们相信，不论帝国主义者怎样进行污蔑、阻挠和破坏，社会主义各国人民和民族独立国家的人民将进行不断的努力，来巩固和发展彼此之间的友谊，从而对世界和平和国际合作事业作出新的贡献。
