    A Robust and Flourishing Seedling
    ——Observing the Strong Vitality of the Commune Ownership System from Fengshan Commune, Liucheng, Guangxi
    Shen Qing
    Like other people's communes, Fengshan People's Commune in Liucheng County, Guangxi, from the day it was established, saw the emergence of a new entity with vigorous youthful vitality – the commune ownership system.
    The commune ownership component of Fengshan Commune is still only a bud. It coexists with the production brigade ownership system and the production team ownership system, and in the immediate future, the production brigade ownership system will still be the basic one. Currently, what belongs to the commune are only three parts: commune-run enterprises, commune-run undertakings, and a portion of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds managed and used by the commune. Commune members usually call these "the commune's family assets."
    There is a reason why commune members say this.
    The New Road Opened Up by the Commune System
    Originally, the commune ownership system of Fengshan Commune, from its very beginning, brought benefits to the people.
    This story must begin with the commune's establishment of a horticultural farm.
    In the Fengshan area, Jiuxian Village was famous for its Ya pears, so its people were relatively wealthy. Before communization, many nearby advanced cooperatives wanted to develop more fruit trees as well. However, as the commune members said at the time, "The orchard is a treasure mountain, easy to approach but difficult to overcome 'three barriers.'" What were these "three barriers"? First, the advanced cooperatives had limited accumulated funds and no money to buy fruit seedlings. Second, they didn't know how to cultivate seedlings and lacked technical personnel for planting orchards. Third, orchards required dedicated management, but the advanced cooperatives had a small scope and limited labor, so they couldn't spare such a workforce. Once, several advanced cooperatives discussed establishing a "joint orchard team," but none could spare many laborers, and no one wanted to send their skilled "old experts" or allocate a large enough piece of land for a nursery. The "three barriers" remained insurmountable.
    In the autumn of 1958, the commune was established. Commune members said, "This time we have a new road." So, they wrote reports again and again, requesting the commune to establish a nursery. The commune had a larger organizational scale and a wider scope of activity, so the framework of the horticultural farm was quickly set up. Fourteen *li* of barren hills around Nandantan Brigade were designated, eighty-four young men and women were transferred from ten brigades, old fruit farmer Xie Futian was transferred from Jiuxian Village, and Party Branch Secretary Wen Jinlin was appointed as the farm's director. However, many difficulties remained. The grass on the barren hills grew taller than people, and tigers roamed about. There were no fruit seedlings, and no money to buy them. At the time, the commune could only allocate 600 yuan in start-up funds. But the commune Party committee and commune members were not intimidated by the difficulties. They made careful plans and studied ways to overcome the difficulties. The commune members of each production brigade were also very enthusiastic. The farm lacked tools, so each brigade sent a draft animal and a set of plows. They also said, "The commune has little money now, so we will advance the young people's food expenses for a month." The young people who were transferred to work at the horticultural farm were even more motivated. There was a lot of grass on the hills, so they cut hundreds of *dan*, sold it, and had funds to run the farm. In one breath, they opened up hundreds of *mu* of wasteland, burned thousands of *dan* of grass and wood ash, and scared away the tigers. They also planted dozens of *mu* of vegetables, sold them for several thousand yuan, and had more than enough funds to run the farm. Thirty young people traveled all over the barren hills and ridges of three nearby counties, collected more than three million wild pear seedlings, bought some, and collected some fruit tree branches from the production brigades. They cut them into small sections, used the "single bud grafting method," and planted more than two million fruit seedlings. In addition, they planted a total of 6,463,000 seedlings using direct seeding and grafting methods. When it was dry, the young commune members carried buckets of water to water them. When the grass was tall and couldn't be hoed, they pulled it out by hand, getting up early and going to bed late, and working diligently. As a result, by the spring of 1959, some fruit seedlings were already ready to be taken out of the nursery. After the farm transplanted 6,600 seedlings and supplied 45,500 seedlings to the commune's brigades, it also sold 59,900 seedlings to other places. It is estimated that from the winter of 1959 to the spring of 1960, another 1.87 million seedlings can be taken out of the nursery. In less than a year, this horticultural farm, which was started with only 600 yuan in cash, turned over 17,350 yuan in enterprise profits to the commune with the money from selling fruit seedlings and vegetables. It also purchased various tools and simple machines worth 6,621 yuan, and bought hundreds of technical reference books.
    The establishment of the horticultural farm educated both the commune members and the commune Party committee. During this period, the commune Party committee gradually clarified the following three principles: First, the establishment of people's communes and the establishment of the commune ownership system are the urgent demands of the masses. They hoped to rely on the commune ownership system to carry out undertakings that had been attempted many times in the era of advanced cooperatives but had not succeeded. Second, due to the characteristics of the commune, which are "large in scale and highly collectivized," the relations of production have developed in new ways compared to advanced cooperatives, making it relatively easy to establish commune-owned enterprises and undertakings. Third, although the establishment and development of the commune ownership system also requires the support of the state, it cannot rely solely on this. The main thing is to rely on the ambition and two hands of all commune members.
    Over the past year, the commune Party committee has acted in accordance with these principles, and as expected, the commune has taken the first step in "simultaneously developing industry and agriculture," and the commune-run enterprises and undertakings have become increasingly prosperous. Now, the entire commune has twelve commune-run enterprises and seven commune-run undertakings. Commune-run enterprises include horticultural farms, fish breeding farms, farm tool factories, saltpeter factories, fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, bamboo ware factories, clothing factories, paper mills, grain processing factories, building materials factories, and duck hatcheries. These enterprises were established by relying on the diligence and thrift of the masses. The total capital construction investment and production investment of the twelve enterprises was only 36,539 yuan; the current total asset value has grown to 248,107 yuan, an increase of nearly six times.
    The rapidly developing commune-run enterprises have provided a large amount of accumulation for the commune. From January to August 1959, the commune's accumulation increased by 100,1727 yuan on the basis of 1958. Among them, the part extracted from the profits of commune-run enterprises accounted for 95.41%, and the part extracted from the various production brigades accounted for 4.59%. The component of the commune ownership system is growing day by day in the entire commune. Now, the total value of the funds of the commune-run enterprises and commune-run undertakings in the entire commune, plus the public accumulation funds and public welfare funds managed and used by the commune, is equivalent to 21.21% of the total income of the ten production brigades in the year since the commune was established. What an exciting thing this is!
    Production Brigades Have a Strong Backing
    After the commune ownership component developed, the first great achievement was to promote the "overall prosperity" of the collective economy of the various production brigades. The commune members' comment was: With the commune having family assets, the production of the brigades has a strong backing.
    All this is mainly reflected in three major events.
    The first event was using the commune's accumulation and investment to solve the problem of insufficient funds for building small mountain reservoirs. The Fengshan area has always been severely dry. The old county chronicles record that from the end of the Qing Dynasty to 1934, there was a "severe drought" every three to five years, with "the drought demon causing disaster," "Wen Source drying up," or "no rain from the Dragon Boat Festival to the Double Ninth Festival." After each disaster, there was "great famine" and "great epidemic." This situation did not improve at all until before liberation. Some villages, which were too dry, abandoned rice and switched to growing sugarcane. After liberation, cooperation was realized, and the masses managed some small-scale water conservancy projects within a society, which eased the situation, but it was still not enough when a major drought occurred. There was a mountain depression called "Little Mountain," where building a dam to form a reservoir could make half of the commune's rice paddies waterlogged. Because of the large amount of labor required, advanced cooperatives could not afford it. After the establishment of the people's commune, large-scale cooperation was organized, mobilizing more than half of the labor force to repair the reservoir, and mobilizing commune members to invest and raise funds. The commune Party committee also took out 9,000 yuan from the commune's accumulation as expenses, so the dam was finally built, and the threat of drought was basically eliminated.
    With water, grain harvests were greatly increased. The summer grain in 1959 increased by 57.39% on the basis of a 31.68% increase in 1958.
    The second event was using materials, technology, and funds to help the production brigades overcome difficulties at several critical moments in production.
    In the spring of 1959, there was a shortage of lime needed for topdressing early rice. Burning lime required blasting stones, and blasting stones required saltpeter. At that time, none of the ten production brigades had saltpeter, so the commune's saltpeter factory rushed to produce three to four thousand *jin*. The stones were blasted open, and the entire commune burned more than 6.1 million *jin* of lime, with an average of 206 *jin* applied per *mu* of field. The commune members said, "The summer grain harvest was thanks to saltpeter."
    In late spring, more than 9,300 *mu* of sugarcane planted by the commune were infested with "cotton aphids," and it looked like yields would be reduced. The situation was very urgent. The production brigade cadres called the commune for help. The commune allocated 510,000 *jin* of native pesticides manufactured by its pesticide factory and 700,000 *jin* of native fertilizer produced by its fertilizer factory. After spraying pesticides and topdressing fertilizer, the sugarcane was saved.
    In early summer, just as sideline production was about to be vigorously developed, the commune-run duck hatchery hatched 77,773 ducklings, which were supplied to the various production brigades. Each person received an average of six ducklings, which immediately promoted a high tide of duck raising. Later, the commune fish fry farm supplied another 1.24 million fish fry, which promoted another high tide of fish farming.
    In the first eight months of 1959, the farm tool factory and the bamboo ware factory manufactured 32,886 pieces of simple farm machinery, new-style walking plows, various carts, and iron and bamboo farm tools, which were supplied to meet the needs of agricultural production in a timely manner. In addition, all professional farms conducted professional technical guidance for the production brigades and trained 120 to 130 professional technicians for the production brigades. They also supported the production brigades with 20,000 yuan in revolving funds.
    All of the above provided a strong impetus for the collective production of the production brigades. The commune ownership system and the production brigade ownership system complemented each other, promoting the overall surge in production in the commune: From January to August 1959, the industrial output value increased by 53.09% compared to the same period in 1958, the agricultural output value increased by 62.45%, the forestry output value increased by 23.87%, the livestock and poultry output value increased by 10%, the sideline production output value increased by 30%, and the fishery output value increased by 23.89%.
    The third event was that the commune's accumulation promoted the rapid development of collective welfare undertakings. After the commune was established, a total of 13,925 yuan was extracted from the commune's accumulation as a foundation to establish a home for the elderly, an obstetrics hospital, a health center, a pharmaceutical factory, and five private schools. It also helped the production brigades to open 74 canteens, 86 nurseries and kindergartens, and 10 clinics. Thanks to nurseries, kindergartens, and public canteens, 1,514 women were freed from housework and child-rearing and were all able to regularly participate in collective production.
    Thanks to the health center, obstetrics hospital, pharmaceutical factory, and medicinal herb garden, a semi-publicly funded medical system of "free treatment, free herbal medicine, cost price for Western medicine, and care for those in difficulty" was implemented throughout the commune. Due to the timely implementation of universal prevention and control work, malaria and smallpox were completely eliminated in 1959 on the basis of the gradual improvement of health conditions over the years.
    "Thickening Waist Three Times" and "Common Leap Forward"
    The second great achievement of the commune ownership system in Fengshan Commune was to help poor teams catch up with rich teams and promote the rapid and balanced economic development of the various production brigades, achieving a "common leap forward."
    Ertang and Longtian are two recognized poor teams (formerly advanced cooperatives). Before the commune was established, the average per capita income of nearby advanced cooperatives was 68.57 yuan, while Longtian only had 47.44 yuan, and Ertang had even less, only 37 yuan.
    Ertang was the poorest. The living conditions of all 237 households in the brigade before liberation were: "Worrying and grieving day after day, rice buckets hanging on carrying poles, looking for rice in the morning to cook for dinner, with no oil in the pot for every meal." After liberation, living standards improved step by step, especially after the establishment of the advanced cooperative. However, due to poor soil and lack of water, grain yields were only 140 to 150 *jin* per *mu*, and compared with other brigades, it was still relatively poor.
    The reason why Ertang was poor was due to three problems: one was drought, resulting in low grain yields; one was the lack of economic crops, and not even one *mu* of high-income sugarcane was planted; and the other was the lack of sideline business, with no orchards and no flocks of ducks. In the era of advanced cooperatives, the masses of Ertang also wanted to solve these problems, but building a small mountain reservoir required tens of thousands of workdays, and Ertang had a small labor force, so how could they do it? If the reservoir could not be built, a large labor force was needed for drought resistance, so where could they find people to engage in sideline business and plant sugarcane? Therefore, the problems could not be solved.
    After communization, with more people and more strength, the Little Mountain Reservoir was built. The commune members of Ertang Brigade had confidence in their hearts and began to plan for catching up with the rich teams. They were determined to "never lose ambition even when the mountains and rivers are exhausted, and spur the horse to catch up with the rich team." During the spring plowing in 1959, 100% of the brigade's labor force worked hard, deep plowing the paddy fields to a depth of seven inches. In the cold weather, the hands of the commune members holding the plow were frozen numb, but they did not stop working, warming their hands by the fire before holding the plow again. Sixty-five-year-old Wei Zheng even asked to go into the chest-high water to open the sluice gate and was busy repairing farm tools and delivering firewood to the commune members all day long. He said, "To catch up with the rich team, I, an old man, must also contribute some strength."
    After all, poor teams had a weak foundation. To catch up with rich teams, they also had to comprehensively develop diversified operations. One of the big heads was sugarcane. If they planted several hundred *mu* of sugarcane, they could increase their income by about one-third. However, the commune members of Ertang Brigade had never planted sugarcane before, and they did not have sugarcane seeds or "sugar presses." If they bought them, sugarcane seeds would cost 2,400 yuan, and "sugar presses" would cost 3,300 yuan. They did not have enough money. The commune members sent more than 100 people to the mountains to cut firewood and burn charcoal, earning nearly 1,000 yuan. The commune also extracted 5,254 yuan from the public accumulation to support them. With the money, the commune members planned day and night, carefully calculated, bought sugarcane seeds and "sugar presses," and planted the sugarcane. They did not know how to install the "sugar press," nor did they understand the pressing method. They were planning to send people to learn, but other production brigades took the initiative to support them. Xinwei Brigade sent people to assist in building the sugar-boiling stove, Toutang Brigade sent bamboo to build the factory, and Jiuxian Village Brigade sent technicians. People said, "Advanced cooperatives and advanced cooperatives are like uncles and brothers, production brigades and production brigades have become close brothers, why not help?" Subsequently, the commune's horticultural farm sent 2,000 fruit seedlings, the duck hatchery sent 1,000 ducklings, the fish farm sent 10,000 fish fry, and the pesticide factory sent a batch of pesticides. Not only did they plant sugarcane, but the sideline production was also booming. As a result, only one year after the establishment of the commune, Ertang Brigade surpassed the level of ordinary teams, greatly shortening the distance from the rich teams.
    Among the ten production brigades in the entire commune, the average per capita annual income of the three rich teams was 106.1 yuan, the average per capita annual income of the five ordinary teams was 90.2 yuan, and Ertang Brigade reached 91.1 yuan. The growth rate of Longtian Brigade was slightly slower, with an average per capita annual income of 62 yuan, which had not yet caught up with the ordinary teams, but it had increased by 14.56 yuan compared to before the commune was established. The commune members said: Since the commune had a family, our waists seem to have thickened three times.
    Not only Ertang Brigade was like this, but other brigades were also like this. Thanks to the help of the commune ownership system, the production of various brigades developed, and income generally increased. In the situation of "rich teams becoming richer and poor teams catching up with rich teams," the income of the major brigades rapidly tended to be balanced. In the year before communization, the average per capita income of rich teams was 99.7 yuan, ordinary teams was 60 yuan, and poor teams was 43 yuan; after communization, it became: the average per capita income of rich teams was 106.1 yuan, the average per capita income of ordinary teams was 90.2 yuan, and the average per capita income of poor teams was 81 yuan. That is to say, the income of commune members of rich teams has increased somewhat, with an average increase of 6.4 yuan per person, the growth rate of ordinary teams is relatively fast, with an average increase of 30.2 yuan per person, and the growth rate of poor teams is even faster, with an average increase of 38 yuan per person.
    This development of the various production brigades chasing each other has led to a general improvement in the lives of the commune members. In the summer harvest of 1959, the income of 2,482 households out of the 2,668 households participating in the distribution in the entire commune increased compared to the same period in 1958, and the income of the remaining households did not decrease. Among the households with increased income, 2,338 households had an increase of less than 60 yuan, 93 households had an increase of 60 yuan to 100 yuan, and 51 households had an increase of more than 100 yuan. The households with overdrafts before communization have now all become households with surpluses. The total sales of daily necessities in Fengshan Store increased by 41.03% compared to the same period in 1958. The amount of commune members' deposits in Fengshan Bank also increased by 60.53% compared to the same period in 1958.
    The rapid tendency of economic development of various production brigades to be balanced, the rapid catch-up of poor teams with rich teams, and the general improvement of commune members' lives have created conditions for the future implementation of a single commune ownership system in people's communes.
    A Glorious and Splendid Development Prospect
    The achievements made by the commune ownership system in Fengshan People's Commune are unattainable by advanced cooperatives. After the commune members realized this, they loved the commune even more and connected their destiny with the commune even more. The commune members, "going on a boat and hoping the boat will go high," enthusiastically looked forward to the rapid development of commune-run enterprises and commune-run undertakings, and the rapid growth of commune accumulation. Almost every day, people came to the commune to offer suggestions:
    "It would be great if the horticultural farm could be expanded more," "It would be great if the duck hatchery could be changed into a livestock and poultry breeding farm," "The grain processing factory should install an additional set of power rice milling machines," "The farm tool factory should add more workers," "The foundry workshop should add a blower, and the forging workshop should add a machine tool," and so on. The commune Party committee has formulated a plan to develop the commune ownership component according to the opinions of the commune members. According to this plan, the development of the people's commune ownership component will be very rapid.
    Like other people's communes, the commune ownership system bud in Fengshan Commune is growing vigorously. The broad masses of commune members have realized from a year of experience that this bud will soon sprout, grow into branches, blossom, and bear fruit, making the countryside lively and making this flower even redder and more fragrant. Because, it is precisely it that "represents the great, glorious, and splendid development prospects of our country's countryside."

    一颗茁壮旺盛的幼芽
    ——从广西柳城凤山公社看公社所有制的强大生命力
    沈青
    和其他的人民公社一样，广西柳城县凤山人民公社从成立的那一天起，就出现了一件有着旺盛青春活力的新事物——公社所有制。
    凤山公社的公社所有制成分还只是一颗蓓蕾，它和生产大队所有制、生产小队所有制同时存在着，而且在最近期间内，生产大队所有制还是基本的。目前，属于公社所有的只有这样三个部分：社办企业、社办事业和由公社掌握使用的一部分公积金、公益金。社员们通常把这些叫做“公社的家底”。
    社员们的这句话不是没有来由的。
    公社制度开辟的新道路
    原来，凤山公社的公社所有制，从一露头儿，就给人们带来了好处。
    这件事要从公社兴办园艺场的经过说起。
    在凤山一带，旧县村以盛产沙梨闻名，因此生活比较富裕。公社化以前，附近的许多高级社都想照样多发展一些果树。但是，正如社员们当时说的：“果园是座万宝山，宝山好上，难闯‘三关’。”哪“三关”？第一是高级社积累的资金有限，没有钱买果苗；第二是不会育苗，缺乏种果园的技术人材；第三，果园是需要专人管理的，但高级社的范围小，劳动力有限，抽不出这样一批劳动力。有一回，几个高级社商量办个“联营果园队”，可是谁也调不出许多劳动力来，更不愿把技术高的“老内行”派出来，也抽不出一整块足够作苗圃的地，“三关”仍然闯不过。
    1958年秋天，公社成立了。社员们说：“这回有了新路。”就一而再、再而三地写报告，要求公社成立一个苗圃。公社的组织规模大，活动范围广，园艺场的架子很快搭起来了。从南丹大队附近划出了十四里方圆的荒岭，从十个大队调来了八十四名男女青年，从旧县村调来了老果农谢福田，还派党支部书记文锦林担任场长。然而，困难仍然很多。荒岭上的草长得比人高，老虎出没无常；没有果苗，也没有钱去买，当时公社只能拨给六百元的开办费。但是公社党委和社员们没有被困难吓倒。他们仔细地作了筹划，研究了克服困难的办法。各个生产大队的社员们也十分热情，场里缺工具，每个大队便送来一头耕牛和一套犁耙。还说：“公社现在钱少，青年们的伙食费由我们垫支一个月。”调到园艺场工作的青年们更是干劲十足。岭上草多，他们割了几百担，卖了，有了办场的资金；一鼓作气，开出了几百亩荒地，烧得成千担草木灰，老虎也吓跑了。他们又种了几十亩蔬菜，卖得几千元，办场的资金绰绰有余了。有三十个青年，走遍了附近三个县的荒山野岭，采集了三百多万株野梨树苗，买了一些并向生产大队收集了一些果树枝条，截成小段，用“单芽嫁接法”，栽下了二百多万株果苗，加上用直播和接枝办法，共栽种了六百四十六万三千多株。旱了，青年社员们便一桶一桶地担水来淋；草高，不能锄，就用手拔，早起晚睡，辛勤经营。结果，到1959年春天，有一些果苗已经出圃，除去本场移植了六千六百株，供应公社各大队四万五千五百株以外，还卖给外地五万九千九百株。预计1959年冬到1960年春，又可以出圃一百八十七万株。不到一年工夫，这个只用了六百元现金办起来的园艺场，用卖果苗和卖菜的钱，向公社交了一万七千三百五十元的企业利润，自己还置办了价值六千六百二十一元的各种工具和简易机械，并且买了几百本技术参考书。
    兴办园艺场这件事，既教育了社员，又教育了公社党委。公社党委在这期间逐步明确了这样三条道理：第一条，成立人民公社，建立公社所有制是群众的迫切要求。他们希望依靠公社所有制，来举办在高级社时代试了多次都办不成的事业。第二条，由于公社的“一大二公”的特点，生产关系比高级社有了新的发展，就能够比较容易地兴办属于公社所有的企业、事业。第三条，建立和发展公社所有制，虽然也需要国家的支持，但是，不能单单依赖这些，主要的还是要依靠全体社员的志气和两只手。
    一年来，公社党委按照这几条去办事，果然使公社迈开了“工农业并举”的第一步，把社办企业和社办事业办得越来越兴旺了。现在，全公社已经有了十二项社办企业和七项社办事业。社办企业包括有园艺场、鱼种场、农具厂、硝药厂、化肥厂、农药厂、竹器厂、被服厂、造纸厂、粮食加工厂、建筑材料厂和孵鸭房。这些企业是依靠群众勤俭经营办起来的，十二个企业的基建投资和生产投资，总共才用了三万六千五百三十九元；现在的资产总值却已经发展到了二十四万八千一百零七元，增加了将近六倍。
    飞速发展着的社办企业，为公社提供了大量的积累。1959年1月到8月公社的积累在1958年的基础上，增长了十万零一千七百二十七元。其中，从社办企业利润里提取的部分占95．41％，从各个生产大队里提取的部分占4．59％。公社所有制的成分在全公社里日益增长着。现在，全公社的社办企业和社办事业的资金总值，加上由公社掌握使用的公积金、公益金，已经相当于建社一年里十个生产大队收入总数的21．21％。这是一件多么令人兴奋的事啊！
    生产大队的生产有了靠山
    公社所有制成分发展起来以后，建立的第一功，就是促进了各个生产大队集体经济“百业齐昌”。社员们的评论是：公社有了家底，大队的生产就有了靠山。
    这一切，主要表现在三件大事上。
    第一件，用公社的积累、投资解决了修建小山水库的资金不足的困难。凤山一带，一向酷旱。旧县志记载：从清末到1934年，大约每隔三几年就有一次“大旱”，“旱魃为灾”，“汶源干涸”，或“由端阳至重阳不雨”，每次灾后，都是“大饥”、“大疫”。这种情况直到解放前，毫无改善。有些村，实在旱得不行，就放弃水稻，改种甘蔗。解放后，实现了合作化，群众在一社之内，经营了一些小型的水利工程，松了一口气；但是遇上大旱，还是不行。有个山坳叫“小山”，筑坝成库，可以使全社半数的稻田成为饱水田。因为需工量大，高级社办不起。人民公社成立以后，组织了大协作，动员一半多的劳动力去修水库，并且发动社员投资，筹集资金。公社党委又从公社积累里拿出九千元做经费，这样大坝终于修成了，旱灾威胁基本消除。
    有了水，粮食就获得了大丰收。1959年的夏粮，在1958年增产31．68％的基础上，又增产了57．39％。
    第二件，在几次生产上的关键时刻，用物质、技术和资金，帮助生产大队闯过了难关。
    1959年春天，早稻追肥需要的石灰缺得很多。烧石灰要炸石头，炸石头要硝药。当时十个生产大队都没有硝药，公社的硝药厂赶忙生产了三、四千斤。石头炸开了，全公社烧成了六百一十多万斤石灰，每亩田平均放了二百零六斤。社员们说：“夏粮丰收多亏了硝药。”
    春末，公社种的九千三百多亩甘蔗生了“棉蚜虫”，眼看着就要减收，情况十分紧急。生产大队的干部给公社打电话请求帮助。公社便把自己农药厂制造的五十一万斤土农药和化肥厂生产的七十万斤土化肥拨出来，先喷药，后追肥，甘蔗才得救。
    夏初，正要大搞副业，公社办的孵鸭房孵出了七万七千七百七十三只仔鸭，供应给各个生产大队，每人平均得了六只，一下子就促成了一次养鸭的高潮，以后，公社鱼苗场又供应了一百二十四万尾鱼苗，又促成了养鱼的高潮。
    在1959年的前八个月里，农具厂和竹器厂制成了三万二千八百八十六件简易农械、新式步犁、各种车子和铁制、竹制的农具，及时供应了农业生产的需要。另外，所有的专业场，都对生产大队进行了专业性的技术辅导，并且为生产大队训练了一百二、三十名专业的技术工人。还支援给生产大队两万元的周转资金。
    以上种种，都使生产大队的集体生产得到了有力的推动。公社所有制和生产大队所有制相辅相成，促进了整个公社各项生产的高涨：1959年1月到8月，工业产值比1958年同期增长了53．09％，农业产值增长了62．45％，林业产值增长了23．87％，畜禽产值增长了10％，副业产值增长了30％，渔业产值增长了23．89％。
    第三件，公社的积累，促进了集体福利事业的飞跃发展。公社建立以后，共从公社积累里抽出了一万三千九百二十五元作基金，举办了一所敬老院、一所妇产院、一所卫生院、一所制药厂和五所民办学校。并且帮助各生产大队开办了七十四个食堂、八十六处托儿所和幼儿园、十处诊疗所。由于有了托儿所、幼儿园和公共食堂，一千五百一十四个妇女摆脱了家务和孩子的拖累，全部能够经常参加集体生产了。
    由于有了卫生院、妇产院、制药厂和药圃，就在全公社范围内实行了“治疗不收费，草药不要钱，西药收成本，困难有照顾”的半公费医疗制度。由于及时进行了全民性的防治工作，1959年在历年卫生条件逐步改善的基础上，完全消灭了疟疾和天花。
    “腰粗三围”和“共同跃进”
    公社所有制在凤山公社建立的第二功，是帮助穷队赶富队，促使各生产大队的经济发展迅速地趋向平衡，“共同跃进”。
    二塘和龙田，是两个被公认的穷队（过去是高级社）。公社建立以前，附近的高级社每人平均收入是六十八元五角七分，而龙田只有四十七元四角四分，二塘更少，才三十七元。
    二塘最穷。全大队二百三十七户，解放前的生活是：“一日忧来一日愁，米筒挂在扁担头，早晨找米晚餐煮，餐餐锅里不见油”。解放后，生活步步提高，特别是成立了高级社后，生活大有改善。但是，由于土瘦水缺，粮食亩产才一百四、五十斤，和其他大队比较起来，仍然是比较贫困的。
    二塘之所以穷，是穷在三个问题上：一个是旱，粮食产量低；一个是没有种经济作物，收入高的糖蔗，一亩也种不上；再一个是副业经营的少，果园没有一处，鸭子没有一帮。在高级社时代，二塘的群众也想解决这些问题，但是，修个小山水库要几万个工，而二塘劳动力又少，哪里办得了？水库修不成，需要大量劳动力来抗旱，哪里还抽得出人来搞副业、种甘蔗？因此，问题无法解决。
    公社化以后，人多力量大，小山水库修成了，二塘大队的社员们心里有底了，就开始盘算起赶富队的问题来。他们立志要“山穷水尽志不穷，快马加鞭赶富队”。1959年春深耕时，全队百分之百的劳动力都出工苦战，把稻田深耕七寸。天寒地冻，社员们扶犁的手冻麻了，也不停工，烘一会火扶一会犁。六十五岁的韦振更要求下到齐胸的水里去开水闸，还成天忙着修农具，给社员们送柴火，他说：“为了赶富队，我老人也要出些力量。”
    穷队毕竟底子薄。要赶上富队，还得全面发展多种经营。其中的一个大头是甘蔗。如果再种上几百亩甘蔗，就可以增加三分之一左右的收入。可是，二塘大队的社员们过去从来没有种过甘蔗，蔗种、“糖榨”也没有。买吧，蔗种要花二千四百元，“糖榨”要花三千三百元，钱不够。社员们就派一百多人上山砍柴烧炭，卖得近一千元。公社也从公共积累里提出了五千二百五十四元支援他们。钱有了，社员们就日夜筹划，精打细算，买了蔗种和“糖榨”，把甘蔗种上了。有了“糖榨”又不会安装，也不懂榨法，正想派人去学，别的生产大队却主动地来支援了。新维大队派人来协助砌熬糖灶，头塘大队送了竹子来盖厂房，旧县村大队派来了技术工。人们说：“高级社跟高级社是叔伯兄弟，生产大队跟生产大队就成为亲兄弟了，为什么不援助？”随后，公社的园艺场又送来了二千株果苗，鸭房送来了一千只鸭仔，鱼场送来了一万尾鱼苗，农药厂送来了一批农药，不仅种上了甘蔗，副业生产也搞得蓬蓬勃勃。结果是：公社建立才一年，二塘大队就超过了一般队的水平。大大缩短了和富队的距离。
    全公社的十个生产大队里，三个富队每人平均年收入是一百零六元一角，五个一般队每人平均年收入是九十元二角，二塘大队却达到了九十一元一角。龙田大队的增长速度稍慢，每人平均年收入六十二元，还没有赶上一般队，但是比公社化前却增加了十四元五角六分，社员们说：自从公社有了家庭，我们的腰好像粗了三围。
    不仅二塘大队如此，其他大队也是如此，由于公社所有制的帮助，各个大队的生产都有发展，收入普遍增加。在“富队越富，穷队赶富队”的情况下，各大队的收入迅速趋向平衡。公社化前一年，富队每人平均收入九十九元七角，一般队六十元，穷队四十三元；公社化后成为：富队每人平均收入一百零六元一角，一般队九十元二角，穷队八十一元。这就是说，富队社员的收入有所增加，每人平均增加六元四角，一般队的增长速度比较快，每人平均增加三十元二角，穷队的增长速度更快，每人平均增加三十八元。
    各个生产大队之间的这种你追我赶的发展，就使社员们的生活获得了普遍的改善。1959年夏收，全公社参加分配的二千六百六十八户社员，有二千四百八十二户的收入比1958年同期增加了，其余的户收入也没有减少。增收户里，增收了六十元以内的有二千三百三十八户，增收六十元到一百元的有九十三户，增收了一百元以上的有五十一户。公社化前的超支户，如今已经全部变成了有余户。凤山商店的日用品销售总额比1958年同期增长了41．03％。凤山银行社员存款额也比1958年同期增加了60．53％。
    各个生产大队的经济发展迅速趋向平衡，穷队迅速赶上富队，社员生活得到普遍改善，这些，就为将来在人民公社里实行单一的公社所有制，逐步地创造着条件。
    光辉灿烂的发展前途
    公社所有制在凤山人民公社立下的这些汗马功劳，是高级社所办不到的。社员们认识到这一点以后，就越发热爱公社，越发把自己的命运跟公社连结在一起。社员们“上船望船高”，热情地盼望着社办企业和社办事业快快发展，公社积累快快增长。几乎天天有人到公社提意见：
  “园艺场再扩大一些多好”，“把孵鸭场改成家畜家禽良种繁殖场就好了”，“粮食加工厂应该多安装一套动力碾米机”，“农具厂应该增加一些工人”，“铸工车间要加鼓风机，锻工车间要加机床”，等等。公社党委按照社员们的意见，已经制订了一个发展公社所有制成分的计划。按照这个规划，人民公社所有制成分的发展将是很快的。
    和其他的人民公社一样，凤山公社所有制这颗蓓蕾正在茁壮地生长。广大社员群众从一年的体验里已经认识到：这颗蓓蕾必将很快成芽、成枝、开花、结果，使农村里春意喧闹，使这朵鲜花更红更香。因为，正是它，“代表着我国农村伟大的光辉灿烂的发展前途”。
