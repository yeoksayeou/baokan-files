    Consolidate and Persist in Mass Amateur Creation
    Sichuan Province Gulin County Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    The amateur cultural and artistic activities in the Gulin mountain area are new buds under the sunshine of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and flowers blooming from the east wind of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the people's commune movement. To express their gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao, to express their revolutionary ambition, to encourage their enthusiasm and to meet the needs of their cultural life, the broad masses of people broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and launched a mass amateur literary and artistic creation upsurge. In particular, in the past year or so, under the active leadership of the county party committee, the masses have been mobilized to sing the praises of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, so that amateur literary and artistic creation closely serves the current political and production central tasks, and there has been a significant improvement in the quality of creation and the content of activities. At present, the number of amateur creators and art enthusiasts in the county has reached more than 50,000. There are creation groups in factories and rural clubs. In particular, more than 100 active industrial and agricultural amateur creators have been contacted through various means to form a strong literary and artistic creation team. In the past two years, the county-level has edited and published 15 kinds of mass-created publications and anthologies, with a total of more than 130 collections and more than 50,000 copies. The form of creation is also rich and colorful. Not only are there folk songs, but also long mountain songs and narrative poems, not only songs, dances, and dramas, but also novels, essays, and memoirs of revolutionary struggles, as well as Qingyin, Sichuan opera, and storytelling works. In a backward mountainous area like ours, located on the border and both poor and blank, before liberation, not to mention that the creations of workers and peasants could not enter the "Hall of Elegance," even the name "Gulin" had never appeared in newspapers and periodicals. However, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, according to incomplete statistics, the articles published by the masses of Gulin in national newspapers and periodicals have reached more than 20; more than 170 articles have been published in provincial newspapers and periodicals; and more than 110 articles have been published in prefectural newspapers and periodicals. The folk song "Chairman Mao is Like the Red Sun" created by Chen Tianjiang was selected into "Red Flag Ballads" as the first song. In the vast rural areas, there is a grand occasion of "where there are masses, there are songs." They deeply feel that it is difficult to express their feelings without composing and singing, just like the members of the Shuikou Commune sing: "The Yangtze River water never dries up, the inner words can't be finished, sing praises to the Communist Party, uneasy if not singing mountain songs." Precisely because of literary and artistic creation activities, enriching cultural and recreational life, the members are more energetic in production and more cheerful in spirit.
    The achievements of mass amateur creation in Gulin County are the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the result of the shining of the General Line. Its development process is also a process of struggle between two roads and two ideologies. For example, we have encountered this kind of argument: "Literary and artistic creation affects production."
  "Scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants, each lives in one industry, laborers can only labor, creation is something for intellectuals to do." These comrades do not enthusiastically encourage and actively support mass creation, but look on coldly and pick on it in many ways; instead of patiently guiding and striving to improve it, they comment and criticize it severely. However, because the county party committee strengthened the leadership of literary and artistic creation, resolutely implemented the Party's literary and artistic policy, launched a mass movement, and conscientiously implemented the principle of combining popularization and improvement, as well as adhering to the principles of amateur voluntariness and small-scale diversity, mass creation in Gulin County appeared in a prosperous situation in a short period of time.
    We have the following experiences in our work:
    1. Adhere to the orientation of serving workers, peasants and soldiers in literature and art, adhere to putting politics in command, and rely closely on the leadership of the Party. While leading the Great Leap Forward in production, the county party committee not only strengthened the organizational and ideological leadership of the entire cultural work, but also made appropriate arrangements for mass amateur creation and gave it great attention. In addition to conscientiously studying and implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts and policies, many responsible comrades of the party committee also vigorously mobilized the masses to create, and often wrote poems themselves to carry out combat mobilization in literary and artistic forms, which played a great role in encouraging the entire creative activity.
    We deeply feel that the momentum of the Great Leap Forward must be reflected in a certain form, and organizing the masses to participate in literary and artistic activities or carry out creation in accordance with the Party's literary and artistic policy just twists the Party's political and ideological work and cultural propaganda activities into one rope. This is the most colorful and most educational. In the past two years, the mass creation in our county has been closely combined with the current central work and the ideological reality of the masses, writing about the events of the time, singing about the local heroes, praising the great Party and Chairman Mao, and singing about the miracles created by the people, thus also powerfully cooperating with and promoting the development of political and production movements.
    In leadership work, it is necessary to oppose both laissez-faire and prevent simplification. The Party has instructed us more than once: we must actively lead, vigorously support, enthusiastically help, consolidate the organization, and rectify the ranks of mass literary and artistic creation. Due to the implementation of this correct instruction, in the past year, the quality of mass creation has improved, which is not only more in line with the requirements of the masses, but also more profoundly reflects the current real struggle.
    2. Rely on the backbone of workers and peasants and launch a mass movement. In the past two years, new people have emerged in large numbers on the literary and artistic front in Gulin County. Of the more than 200 works published in provincial-level and above newspapers and periodicals in our county, more than 95% were written by worker and peasant comrades. We deeply feel that worker and peasant authors are talented, they have distinct loves and hates, and their lives are rich. Once they master certain writing skills, they can write more outstanding works. For them, literary and artistic creation is not only possible, but also can be done well. Therefore, we are full of confidence in mobilizing active industrial and agricultural amateur creators and launching mass creation. The mass literary and artistic creation movement has produced a large number of worker and peasant authors, which has cultivated a strong reserve force for the proletarian literary and artistic team and transported new blood.
    3. Adhere to the principles of amateur voluntariness and small-scale diversity, vigorously popularize and actively improve. Chairman Mao said in "The United Front in Cultural Work": "All work for the masses must start from the needs of the masses, not from any good personal wishes." He also said: "Any work that requires the participation of the masses, if there is no consciousness and voluntariness of the masses, will become a mere formality and fail." The work in the past two years has proved that adhering to the principles of amateur voluntariness and small-scale diversity, and not blindly greedy for large and numerous, is an important factor in ensuring the quantity and quality of mass creation, and is also an important factor in promoting the consolidation and improvement of mass creation.
    We feel that without a large amount of popularization, revolutionary literature and art cannot become the literature and art of the national working people. Only on the basis of popularization can we better improve, and only under the guidance of improvement can we achieve a higher level of popularization. We have adopted the method of launching a mass movement, liberating our minds, writing and painting a lot, and seeking quality from quantity. This is completely necessary and conforms to the laws of development of things. However, after more than a year of mass literary and artistic self-education movement, the requirements of the masses have been improved, and the masses' appreciation level and creative activities cannot stay at the original level, which needs to be improved. This is just as Chairman Mao said: "The people demand popularization, and then they demand improvement." This improvement is the "improvement on the basis of popularization" that Chairman Mao said. This improvement is determined by popularization and at the same time gives guidance to popularization.
    Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, mass amateur creation in our Gulin mountain city has blossomed and borne fruit. However, our work is still far behind the situation of the Great Leap Forward and far behind the needs of the people. In order to encourage the labor production enthusiasm of the masses, build socialism at a high speed, and change the poor and blank face of the mountainous area as soon as possible, mass creation must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, further implement the policy of "serving politics, serving production, and serving workers, peasants and soldiers" and the principles of amateur voluntariness and small-scale diversity, actively improve on the basis of vigorous popularization, let go of mobilizing the masses, regularize the mass amateur creation movement, actively cultivate the backbone team, and improve the quality of book and publication publishing. It can be predicted that 1960 will not only be a year of continuous leap forward in economic construction, but also a greater harvest will be achieved on the literary and artistic front.

    把群众业余创作巩固起来，坚持下去
    四川省古蔺县文学艺术联合会
    古蔺山区的业余文化艺术活动，是毛主席文艺思想的阳光普照下的新芽，是工农业大跃进和人民公社化运动这股东风吹开的花朵。广大人民为了抒发对党和毛主席的感激心情，表达自己的革命雄心，鼓舞自己的干劲和满足自己文化生活的需要，破除迷信、解放思想，掀起了群众性的业余文艺创作高潮。特别是这一年多来，在县委的积极领导下，发动群众歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社，使业余文艺创作紧密地为当前的政治、生产中心工作服务，在创作质量和活动内容都有了显著的提高。目前参加业余创作和文艺爱好者，全县已达五万多人，工厂和农村的俱乐部都有创作组，特别是通过各种方式联系了一百多名工农业余创作积极分子，组成了一支有力的文艺创作队伍。两年来，县一级编辑出版了群众创作的刊物、选集等十五种，共一百三十余集，达五万余册。创作的形式，也丰富多彩。不仅有民歌，而且有长篇山歌、叙事诗，不仅有歌、舞、剧，还有小说、散文和革命斗争回忆录，以及清音、川剧和说唱作品。像我们这样一个地处边陲，又穷又白的落后山区，解放前不说工农群众的创作不能登“大雅之堂”，就连“古蔺”的名字也从未能在报刊上出现过。但1958年大跃进以来，据不完全统计，古蔺群众在全国性报刊上发表的文章即达二十余件；在省级报刊上发表的达一百七十多件；地专一级报刊上发表了一百一十多件。陈天江创作的民歌“毛主席像红太阳”，被选入“红旗歌谣”作为第一首。在广大的农村里，出现了“哪里有群众，那里就有歌声”的盛况。他们深深地感到，不编不唱就难以抒发自己的情怀，这就像水口公社的社员唱的：“长江水儿流不干，内心话儿说不完，声声歌颂共产党，不唱山歌心不安”。正由于搞了文艺创作活动，丰富了文娱生活，社员们生产更加有劲，精神更加愉快。
    古蔺县群众业余创作的成绩，是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利，是总路线光辉照耀的结果。它的发展过程，也是两条道路两种思想的斗争过程。比如说，我们就遇见过这种论调：“文艺创作影响生产”。
  “士农工商，各居一业，劳动者只能劳动，创作是知识分子搞的事”。这些同志对群众创作不是热情鼓励，积极支持，而是冷眼旁观，多方挑剔；不是耐心辅导，努力提高，而是评头品足，大泼冷水。但是，由于县委加强了对文艺创作的领导，坚决执行了党的文艺方针，大搞群众运动，认真贯彻了普及和提高相结合以及坚持了业余自愿、小型多样的原则，古蔺县的群众创作就在短时期内，出现了繁荣的局面。
    我们在工作中有以下几点体会：
    一、坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方针，坚持政治挂帅，紧紧依靠党的领导。县委在领导生产大跃进的同时，不但加强了对整个文化工作的组织领导和思想领导，而且对群众业余创作也作了适当的安排，给予了极大的重视。不少党委负责同志，除了认真地学习和贯彻毛主席的文艺思想和方针政策以外，还大力发动群众创作，自己也常常作诗，以文艺形式进行战斗动员，这对整个创作活动，起到了极大的鼓舞作用。
    我们深切地感觉到，大跃进的声势，必须要有一定的形式来反映，而按照党的文艺方针组织群众参与文艺活动或进行创作，则恰好使党的政治思想工作和文化宣传活动拧成了一股绳。这是最丰富多彩的，也是最具有教育意义的。两年来，我县的群众创作，由于紧密地结合了当前的中心工作和群众的思想实际，写当时的事迹，歌就地的英雄，颂伟大的党和毛主席，唱人们创造的奇迹，因而也有力地配合和推动了政治和生产运动的开展。
    在领导工作上，既要反对放任自流，也要防止简单化。党不止一次地指示我们：对群众文艺创作必须积极领导，大力支持，热情帮助，巩固组织，整顿队伍。由于执行了这一正确的指示，一年来，群众创作的质量提高了，既更符合群众的要求，也更加深刻地反映了当前的现实斗争。
    二、依靠工农骨干，大搞群众运动。两年来，古蔺县的文艺战线上新人辈出。我们全县刊登在省级以上报刊的二百多件作品中，95％以上是工农同志作的。我们深切地感觉到，工农作者是有才华的，他们爱憎分明，生活丰富，一旦掌握了一定的写作技巧，就能写出比较出色的作品来。文艺创作对他们说来，不只能搞，而且能搞得好。因此，我们对发动工农业余创作积极分子，大搞群众创作，充满了信心。群众文艺创作运动涌现了大批工农作者，就为无产阶级的文艺队伍培养了雄厚的后备力量，输送了新的血液。
    三、坚持业余自愿和小型多样的原则，大力普及，积极提高。毛主席在“文化工作中的统一战线”一文中说：“一切为群众的工作都要从群众的需要出发，而不是从任何良好的个人愿望出发。”又说：“凡是需要群众参加的工作，如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。”两年来的工作证明：坚持了业余自愿和小型多样的原则，不盲目贪大贪多，是保证群众创作的数量与质量的重要因素，也是促使群众创作巩固和提高的重要因素。
    我们感到没有大量的普及，革命的文艺就不可能成为全民性的劳动人民的文艺，只有在普及的基础上，才能更好地提高，也只有在提高的指导下，才能达到更高一级的普及。我们采取了大搞群众运动的办法，解放思想，大写大画，从量中求质，这是完全必要的，也是合乎事物发展规律的。但是经过一年多群众文艺的自我教育运动以后，群众的要求提高了，群众的欣赏水平和创作活动不可能停留在原有的水平，这就有待于提高。这正如毛主席所说的：“人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高。”这种提高，是毛主席所说的“在普及基础上的提高。这种提高，为普及所决定，同时又给普及以指导。”
    在党的领导下，在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，我们古蔺山城的群众业余创作，已经开花结果。但是，我们的工作还远远落后于大跃进的形势，远远落后于人民群众的需要。为了鼓舞群众的劳动生产热情，高速度的建设社会主义，尽快地改变山区的穷白面貌，今后群众创作必须更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，进一步贯彻“为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务”的方针和业余自愿、小型多样的原则，在大力普及的基础上积极提高，放手发动群众，使群众的业余创作运动经常化，积极培养骨干队伍，提高书刊出版质量。可以预料，1960年不只在经济建设上将是一个连续跃进之年，在文艺战线上也同样会获得更大的丰收。
