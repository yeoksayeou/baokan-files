Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Beijing Municipal Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, and Sports successfully concluded on the 29th, lasting four days. This congress was a rally to review the great achievements of the capital's cultural and educational work since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, exchange experiences, and promote the continued leap forward of the capital's cultural and educational work.

Comrade Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, spoke at the meeting on the 29th. He spoke about the current domestic and international situation and expressed the hope that everyone would make good arrangements for work, study, and rest during the continued leap forward, so as to ensure a balance between work and leisure, good health, and high morale, in order to guarantee the continuous advancement of work.

A total of 7,400 representatives of advanced units and advanced workers attended the congress. They represent education, science, childcare, medical services, sports, culture and art, news and publishing, etc., including cultural and educational institutions run by industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, streets, government offices, organizations, and the military. The representatives are outstanding figures selected from approximately 220,000 employees on the city's cultural and educational front. At the meeting, 257 red banner units, 1,912 advanced collectives, and 5,946 advanced workers were awarded red banners, certificates, and medals by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the CPC and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, due to upholding the principle of putting politics in command and extensively launching mass movements, Beijing's cultural and educational undertakings have witnessed a situation of great leap forward, great popularization, great improvement, and great prosperity. In the past two years, the number of universities and colleges and students enrolled in the capital has increased by 50%, and the number of secondary specialized schools has almost doubled. A scene of abundant harvests has emerged in the field of scientific and technological research. Literary and artistic undertakings have also made great development and improvement. Many new artistic works have shaped contemporary heroic figures, giving the audience great encouragement. The city has widely launched a patriotic health campaign, forming a medical and health care network covering urban and rural areas, and the communist style in health work is growing. Mass sports and national defense sports have been widely carried out, and the level of sports has improved by leaps and bounds. At present, the anti-illiteracy campaign is vigorously underway throughout the city, and 25 factories and mines have established amateur education systems from elementary school to university. In the process of the great popularization and great improvement of cultural and educational undertakings in the past two years, a contingent of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert and capable of engaging in both mental and physical labor is rapidly and gradually growing. A large number of new forces have emerged, possessing soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, daring to create, and making many outstanding achievements in their work.

Deng Tuo, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, delivered a report at the beginning of the congress. After summarizing the great achievements of the capital's cultural and educational work in the past two years, he emphasized that every victory on the cultural and educational front is a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached great importance to the significant role of cultural and educational work in the entire revolutionary cause and has put forward extremely valuable instructions on many aspects of cultural and educational work, which have become a guide that cannot be separated from work at any time. In order to achieve greater victories in future work, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and use this invincible ideological weapon to better arm everyone's minds. Deng Tuo said that our socialist construction is to prepare material and spiritual conditions for the realization of communism, so we must consider the grand goal of communism when observing problems, determining policies, and handling work. Deng Tuo encouraged the representatives present to establish the lofty aspirations of proletarian collectivism, carry forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and climb the peaks of culture, science, and technology. Deng Tuo finally hoped that all the representatives would be redder and more expert, and help the backward become advanced, continue to play a leading role, backbone role, and bridge role in the socialist competition movement, and strive to achieve a continued leap forward in 1960.

During the congress, more than 140 representatives exchanged advanced ideas and advanced experiences at the congress and in medium-sized meetings. Among them were teachers from universities and colleges, scientific workers, artists, doctors, athletes, as well as elementary school graduates who started village-run private elementary schools from scratch, outstanding nursery workers from rural women, and grassroots cultural work cadres who wholeheartedly served the masses. They offered treasures and sought advice at the meeting, expressing their determination to respond to the Party's call and strive to become more advanced and leap forward again.

During the congress, 646 units on the capital's cultural and educational front sent more than 4,200 enthusiastic congratulatory letters, good news reports, and letters of determination. Some units also sent newly trial-produced products to report good news to the congress.

    从1958年大跃进以来，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，由于坚持政治挂帅，广泛地开展了群众运动，北京的文教事业出现了大跃进、大普及、大提高、大繁荣的局面。两年来首都高等学校和在校学生数增加了50％，中等专业学校增加将近一倍；在科学技术研究领域中出现了一片丰收景象；文艺事业也有了很大的发展和提高，不少新的艺术作品塑造了当代的英雄人物，给予观众很大鼓舞；全市广泛开展了爱国卫生运动，形成了遍及城乡的医疗保健网，卫生工作中的共产主义风格正在成长；群众体育、国防体育运动广泛开展，体育运动的水平有了飞跃的提高。目前全市扫盲运动蓬勃开展，二十五个厂矿举办起从小学到大学的业余教育体系。两年来在文教事业大普及大提高过程中，一支又红又专、既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的工人阶级知识分子队伍正在迅速地逐步地成长，一大批新生力量涌现出来，他们有高涨的革命热情，敢于创造，在工作中做出许多优异的成绩。
