Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Under the cruel rule of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, Taiwanese women are living increasingly miserable and inhumane lives.

According to Taiwanese newspapers, the employment and lives of the vast majority of women in Taiwan are not guaranteed. Suicides occur almost daily in Taiwan. The Taiwan "United Daily News" reported on February 27th that Li Jianzu, a woman from Caotun Township, was forced by poverty to force her seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter to take poison, and then committed suicide herself. A farmer, Chen Zhangzhi, ran to Bitan to commit suicide, leaving behind three pitiful children. Many women sell their children or become prostitutes. According to the Chiang gang's "Ministry of the Interior," the number of "adopted daughters" in Taiwan increased to 190,000 in 1959. Many "adopted daughters" suffer abuse and torment from an early age, and when they grow up, they are resold by human traffickers and become prostitutes. In the past month alone, the number of prostitutes in the "Jiangshan Lou" red-light district in Taipei has increased from more than 800 to 1,090.

The rampant and overbearing behavior of the U.S. military in Taiwan has deepened the disaster for Taiwanese women. According to Taiwanese newspapers, in areas where U.S. troops are concentrated in Taiwan, in addition to the "military brothels" (comfort women establishments) commonly established by the Chiang Kai-shek clique for U.S. troops, the United States has also organized "maid clubs" in all U.S. military bases and U.S. residential areas in Taiwan, specifically for U.S. troops to vent their bestial desires. In Kaohsiung City alone, one "maid club" has 400 women dedicated to being raped by U.S. troops.

    自杀案件迭起　被迫沦为娼妓
    台湾妇女生活越来越悲惨
    新华社8日讯　在美帝国主义和蒋介石反动集团的残酷统治下，台湾妇女过着越来越悲惨的非人生活。
    据台湾报纸透露，在台湾，广大妇女的职业和生活毫无保障。台湾差不多每天都有自杀案件发生，台湾“联合报”2月27日报道，草屯镇妇女李简足，为生活所迫，强迫七岁儿子和五岁女儿服下毒药，然后自己服毒身死；农妇陈章枝跑到碧潭自杀，抛下了三个可怜的孩子。许多妇女卖儿卖女或者沦为娼妓。据蒋邦“内政部”宣布，1959年台湾的“养女”已增加到十九万人。许多“养女”自小受尽虐待和折磨，稍大后又被人口贩子辗转贩卖沦为娼妓。最近一个月内，仅台北“江山楼”娼妓区的妓女人数，就由原来八百多人增加到一千零九十人。
    美军在台湾横行霸道，更加深了台湾妇女的灾难。据台湾报纸透露，现在，在台湾美军聚居区，除了蒋介石集团在各地为美军普遍设立的“军中乐园”（军妓院）外，美国还在台湾所有军事基地和美军住宅区，组织了一种专供美军发泄兽欲的“下女俱乐部”。仅高雄市一个“下女俱乐部”，就有四百个妇女专供美军蹂躏。
