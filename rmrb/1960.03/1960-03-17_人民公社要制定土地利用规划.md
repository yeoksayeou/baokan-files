To ensure the continuous and comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, many people's communes are developing land use plans. This is a major event for people's communes in promoting the development of productive forces.

Developing a land use plan means, based on the soil, climate, and other natural conditions of each people's commune's location, considering the needs of the state and the people for various agricultural products, and the interdependent relationships between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, adapting to the development trends of water conservancy, garden-style farming, agricultural mechanization, and electrification, and referring to the original cultivation foundation, proposing plans for planting and utilizing land according to local conditions. This seeks to use land in the most rational and economical way, to allocate various basic constructions in the most appropriate manner, and to maximize the potential of the land, thereby promoting the universal increase in the production of various crops and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery.

The maximum rational utilization of land is an important symbol of the superiority of the socialist system and also a product of our country's people's communes. Land, the most important means of production in agriculture, was mostly monopolized by a few landlords and rich peasants in the old society. The cruel exploitative system restricted the productive enthusiasm of the laborers. In that era, there was no way to talk about the rational utilization of land; the countryside went bankrupt, agriculture was severely damaged, and the fertility of the land was constantly destroyed. The reform of the land system liberated the productive forces from the feudal system, and land utilization became more rational than in the past. However, the scattered and small-scale peasant economy, whether in terms of land ownership or the productive capacity of individual households, still seriously hindered the further rational utilization of land. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the land utilization rate gradually increased. Especially after the widespread establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives that abandoned the system of private land ownership, significant changes occurred in land utilization, beginning to break through the boundaries of scattered and small plots of land, initially realizing planting according to local conditions within a certain range. However, due to the relatively small scale of advanced agricultural cooperatives, their operating scope generally being limited to agriculture, and not yet completely shaking off the old farming habits of the small-scale peasant economy, as well as the weakness of manpower and resources, the maximum rational utilization of land was still subject to many restrictions. After the establishment of people's communes, the situation fundamentally changed. People's communes have a large organizational scale, a wide range of activities, and strong manpower and resources, and the artificial restrictions on the rational utilization of land have been finally broken. People are beginning to be able to rationally allocate land and effectively use land on large tracts, according to unified plans and actual needs. How can this possibility be most fully realized? The most important approach is to comprehensively and conscientiously develop land use plans.

Since 1958, a mass soil survey has been carried out nationwide, laying a good foundation for carrying out land use planning. In the past few years, a lot of experience has been accumulated in adjusting cropping zones and rationally utilizing land in increasingly large-scale collective production. In particular, the vigorous development of high-yield plots and garden-style farming in the past two years has preliminarily carried out land use planning. These are all favorable conditions for developing land use plans.

With a land use plan, the people's commune can adapt the planting of various crops and diversified operations to the basic characteristics of the local land, which can both increase the unit yield and total output of various crops, and correctly arrange diversified operations to make them closely coordinated and mutually promote each other. Some people's communes have made preliminary land plans, although they are not yet complete or accurate, but they have already played a positive role in the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. For example, the Xinxing People's Commune in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, immediately made unified arrangements for all the land after the establishment of the commune, based on the state plan and the characteristics of each management area. Hilly areas mainly plant soybeans and sugar beets, supplemented by corn and millet; mountainous and forested areas mainly develop animal husbandry, forestry, and silkworm farming; low-lying and watery areas mainly plant rice, supplemented by corn and sorghum; swamp areas mainly raise fish and harvest sheep grass; and plain areas mainly plant wheat and sorghum, supplemented by the development of transportation, weaving, and other sideline occupations. In this way, the potential of land and labor has been further exploited. In agriculture, the unit area yield of 50,000 mu of wheat in the whole commune in 1959 increased by 23% compared with the bumper harvest of 1958, and the total output increased by nearly two times. More than 20,000 mu of sugar beets were all arranged on the most suitable land, and the output also increased. Forestry and animal husbandry have also developed rapidly, and the income of commune members has greatly exceeded previous years.

Another benefit of developing a land use plan is that it is conducive to accelerating the transformation of the old and chaotic land utilization landscape, making it adapt to the requirements of agricultural mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy, and can better implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Hubei Province mobilized 3 million commune members to carry out large-scale land planning and land transformation, and now more than 14 million mu of cultivated land has achieved elementary garden-style farming, accounting for about one-quarter of the province's cultivated land area. Zhaoyang County in this province has a total of 2.18 million mu of cultivated land, more than half of which is uneven, with crisscrossing roads, scattered plots, and inconvenient cultivation. Last winter and this spring, under the leadership of the county party committee, a mass movement was launched to carry out farmland capital construction in accordance with the land use plan, turning 1.2 million mu of uneven land into flat land, and turning more than 130,000 scattered plots into more than 7,000 large areas of cultivated land; filling and digging unnecessary ditches and field ridges, and leveling unutilized wasteland and open space, expanding cultivated land by 100,000 mu; at the same time, according to the new plan, more than 3,000 water conservancy projects were built, and highways, main roads, and field roads were constructed. In this way, good conditions have been created for accelerating the realization of agricultural modernization.

The following issues should be noted when developing land use plans:

The interests of the state and the interests of the commune, the overall interests and the partial interests should be combined. The people's commune must not only obey the state's plan, but also give full play to the initiative of adapting to local conditions in accordance with the local natural conditions and referring to the past operating conditions. Not only should agriculture, as the basis of the entire national economy, be adapted to the development of the entire national economy, but also within agriculture, food crops and industrial raw material crops, agricultural crops, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery should all be developed in proportion. Only in this way can we ensure the high-speed development of the entire socialist economy. The formulation of land use plans must conform to the policy of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations." On the principle of ensuring the completion of the state plan, the production of grain, cotton, oilseeds, flax, tea, tobacco, sugar crops, silkworms, fruits, vegetables, medicinal materials, etc., should all be arranged on the most suitable land, and the production and operation focus of each commune should be determined according to local conditions. At the same time, when state organs and state-owned enterprises need to use land, such as when building roads and engaging in other basic constructions, they must also try to use barren land and bad land as much as possible, and occupy as little cultivated land and good land as possible, so as not to adversely affect agricultural production. The land occupied by projects that are planned to be built but have not yet started, even if they are to start construction in the second half of the year but are still idle in the first half of the year, should still be handed over to the people's commune to plant a season of early-maturing crops. Doing so is the truly global perspective. Within the scope of the commune, when it is necessary to occupy a part of the land in order to develop certain enterprises directly operated by the commune, and when it is necessary to adjust a part of the land between teams in order to make more rational use of the land, overall arrangements should be made in accordance with the principle of benefiting the development of the whole commune's production and in accordance with the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. According to the current three-level ownership based on the team, the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit should be followed, so that both the commune and the team, and between the teams, can achieve production benefits after the adjustment. During the adjustment, political and ideological work should also be done well, so that the cadres and the masses of each team can voluntarily do so.

The long-term interests should be combined with the current interests, not only to adapt to the long-term goal of fully realizing agricultural modernization within a few years, but also to adhere to the principle of benefiting the present. Among the various basic constructions, they should be distinguished in order of priority and urgency, and try to occupy as little cultivated land as possible, and use all non-cultivated land to arrange basic construction and other uses. For example, if roads and canals are planned, they do not necessarily have to be expanded very wide at once. It may be better to build them narrower according to current needs. New residential areas cannot be built in one or two years. The residential base must still be properly used before the new village is built. In short, there must be a clear and inspiring goal that must be achieved within a few years, and there must also be practical steps to achieve this goal. The standard for whether the land is used rationally or not depends on whether it is conducive to the development of production. Under certain conditions, the measures that are most conducive to the development of production are also the most rational. If the conditions change and the measures do not change accordingly, it will be unreasonable. If the conditions have not changed to the extent that it is necessary to completely change the measures, it would be unreasonable to completely change the measures prematurely.

Only by correctly handling the relationship between the interests of the state and the interests of the commune, the overall interests and the partial interests, and the long-term interests and the current interests, can we achieve the most rational and economical use of land.

We must adapt to the objective conditions of the land, and also pay attention to giving full play to people's subjective initiative. Investigating and studying the natural conditions of the land, such as soil, topography, and water sources, is on the one hand to adapt to it, and more importantly to transform it. We must strive to master the objective laws of land use; however, it is by no means to say that we should succumb to objective conditions, but to use objective laws to control nature and conquer nature, so that it becomes more conducive to the development of production under certain conditions. We must not only see the adaptability of various crops to different lands, but also see that the topography and soil quality of various lands can be transformed by manpower.

In most parts of the country, the development of land use plans by people's communes is still a new task, and the workload is also very large. However, as long as we concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party, and make full use of the experience in land use accumulated by the masses in production practice; and do a good job in cadre training, so that the broad masses of grass-roots cadres master scientific knowledge about land use, this work will surely be done well. In order to set an example for the development of land use plans, and also to adapt to the current needs of mechanization and water conservancy, we can first focus on doing a good job in the land use planning of mechanized farming areas and irrigation areas. Mountain areas, low-lying areas, dry-land areas, and rice areas, all different types of areas, must also establish advanced banners for the development of land use plans.

Spring plowing and production will soon be widely launched. A prominent feature of this year's agricultural production front is the combination of large-scale high-yield movement centered on vigorously developing high-yield plots, and expanding cultivated land area and striving for comprehensive increase in production; to correctly delineate high-yield plots, we must make a comprehensive plan for land use. Party committees and agricultural departments at all levels must conscientiously lead and effectively help all people's communes, and vividly and concretely express the great ambition of developing agricultural production at high speed and comprehensively and gradually changing the face of rural life through land use planning.

    人民公社要制定土地利用规划
    为了农业的持续的全面的跃进，许多人民公社正在制定土地利用规划。这是人民公社促进生产力发展的一件大事。
    制定土地利用规划，就是根据各个人民公社所在地的土壤、气候和其他自然条件，考虑到国家和人民对各种农产品的需要和农林牧副渔相互依存的关系，适应水利化、园田化、农业机械化和电气化的发展趋势，参照原有的耕作基础，提出因地种植和因地利用的方案，以求最合理地最节约地使用土地，最妥善地配置各项基本建设，最大限度地发挥土地潜力，从而促进各种农作物普遍增产，农林牧副渔全面发展。
    土地的最大限度地合理利用，这是社会主义制度优越性的重要标志之一，同时也是我国人民公社的产物。土地，这个农业最重要的生产资料，在旧社会，大部分为少数地主富农所垄断；残酷的剥削制度，束缚着劳动者的生产积极性。在那样的时代，根本说不上合理利用土地，农村破产，农业受到严重摧残，地力不断地遭受着破坏。土地制度的改革，把生产力从封建制度下解放了出来，土地的利用比过去合理了。但是，分散的细小的小农经济，无论就土地占有情况来说，还是就各家各户的生产能力来说，都仍然严重地阻碍着土地的进一步合理利用。随着互助合作运动的开展，土地利用率逐步提高；特别是抛弃了土地私有制度的高级农业社普遍建立之后，土地利用情况发生了重大的变化，开始突破了分散的狭小的地块的界限，初步实现了一定范围之内的因地种植。但是，由于高级农业社的规模仍然比较小，经营范围一般限于农业，而且还没有完全摆脱旧有的小农经济的耕作习惯，以及人力物力的薄弱等等因素，仍然使土地的最大限度的合理利用受到许多限制。人民公社建立之后，情况发生了根本的变化。人民公社组织规模大，活动范围广，人力物力强，在合理利用土地方面的人为的限制就最后地被打破了。人们开始能够在大片的土地上，按照统一计划和实际需要，最合理地支配土地，最有效地使用土地。怎样才能把这样的可能性最充分地发挥出来呢，最重要的一个作法就是全面地、认真地制定土地利用规划。
    1958年以来，在全国范围内开展了群众性的土壤普查工作，为开展土地利用规划工作打下了很好的基础。过去几年，在规模越来越大的集体生产中，也已经积累了不少关于调整耕作区划、合理利用土地的经验。特别是近两年大搞丰产方、大搞园田化，初步进行了土地利用规划。这些都是制定土地利用规划的有利条件。
    人民公社有了土地利用规划，就可以使各种农作物的种植和多种经营同当地的土地的基本特点相适应，既能够提高各种作物的单位产量和总产量，又能够正确安排多种经营，使之密切配合，互相促进。有些人民公社作了初步的土地规划，虽然还不够完备、精确，但已经对农、林、牧、副、渔的全面发展起了积极的作用。如黑龙江桦川县新兴人民公社，在建社以后立即根据国家计划和各管理区的特点，对全部土地作了统一安排。丘陵地区，以种植大豆、甜菜为主，辅以玉米、谷子；多山多林地区，以发展畜牧业、林业、养蚕业为主；低洼多水地区，以种植水稻为主，辅以玉米、高粱；沼泽地带以养鱼和打羊草为主；平原地区以种植小麦、高粱为主，辅以发展运输、编织等副业。这样，土地和劳力的潜在力量都进一步发挥出来了。在农业方面，1959年全社五万亩小麦单位面积产量比大丰收的1958年还提高了23％，总产量提高将近两倍。二万多亩甜菜全部安排到了最适宜的土地上，产量也提高了。林业、牧业也都迅速发展，社员收入大大超过往年。
    制定土地利用规划的又一个好处，就是有利于加速改造旧有的零乱的土地利用面貌，使它适应农业机械化、电气化、水利化的要求，能够更好地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。湖北省动员三百万公社社员，大规模地开展了土地规划和改造土地的工作，现在已有一千四百多万亩耕地实现了初级园田化，约占全省耕地面积的四分之一。这个省的枣阳县，共有耕地二百一十八万亩，一半以上都起伏不平，道路错综，田块分散，耕作不便。去冬今春，在县委领导下，按照土地利用规划大搞农田基本建设的群众运动，把一百二十万亩不平的土地变成了平整的土地，把十三万多块分散的土地变成了七千多块大片的耕地；填挖了不必要的沟渠、地埂，平整了未利用的荒场、空地，共扩大耕地十万亩；同时，按照新的规划，兴修了三千多处水利工程，修筑了公路、大路、田间道路。这样，就为加速实现农业现代化创造了很好的条件。
    在制定土地利用规划的时候，应当注意以下几个问题：
    要把国家利益和公社利益、整体利益和局部利益结合起来。人民公社既要服从国家的计划，又要按照当地的自然情况，参照历来的经营情况，充分发挥因地制宜的积极性。不但作为整个国民经济的基础的农业要同整个国民经济的发展相适应，在农业内部，粮食和工业原料作物，农作物和林、牧、副、渔，也都要按比例地发展。只有这样，才能保证整个社会主义经济高速度发展。制定土地利用规划，必须合乎“以粮为纲，全面多种经营”的方针，要在保证完成国家计划的原则下，使粮食、棉花、油料、麻类、茶叶、烟叶、糖料、蚕丝、果品、蔬菜、药材等等的生产，都安排在最适宜的土地上，并且因地制宜确定各社的生产经营重点。同时，国家机关、国营企业在需要使用土地的时候，例如在修筑道路和从事其它各项基本建设的时候，也必须尽量利用荒地、坏地，尽可能地少占用耕地、良田，以免使农业生产受到不利的影响。计划建筑而还没有开工的工程占用的土地，即使是下半年要开工而上半年还闲着，也应该仍然交给人民公社种植一季早熟作物。这样做，才是真正有全局的观点。在公社范围内，为了发展公社直接经营的某些企业需要占用一部分土地的时候，以及为了土地的更合理的利用而不得不在队与队之间调整一部分土地的时候，都应该按照有利于全社生产发展和按照互助互利的原则，统筹安排，按照目前的以队为基础的三级所有制，本着协作互利的精神，使社与队之间和队与队之间都能在调整后得到有利于生产的效果。在调整的时候还要做好政治思想工作，使各队干部和群众都能自愿地这样来做。
    要把长远的利益同目前的利益结合起来，既要适应若干年内全面实现农业现代化的远大目标，也要坚持以当前受益为主的原则。在各项基本建设之间要分别先后缓急，并且尽量少占用耕地，利用一切非耕地安排基本建设及其他用途。例如道路、渠道规划出来了，并不一定一下子都扩展得很宽，不妨先根据当前的需要修窄一点，新居民点不是一两年之内都能修建起来的。住宅基地在新村没有建筑以前，仍然要妥善利用。总之，既要有方向明确的、鼓舞人心的若干年之内一定要达到的目标，也要有达到这目标的切实的步骤。土地利用得合理不合理，标准就看对发展生产是不是有利。在一定的条件下，最利于发展生产的措施，也就是最合理的。条件变了，措施不随之而变，就会不合理。条件还没有变到需要完全改变措施的程度，就过早地完全改变措施，那也不合理。
    只有正确地处理国家利益和公社利益、整体利益和局部利益、长远利益和目前利益之间的关系，才能做到最合理地最节约地使用土地。
    要适应土地的客观情况，也要注意充分发挥人的主观能动性。调查研究土地的自然情况，如土壤、地形、水源等等，一方面是为了适应它，更主要的是为了改造它。对于土地利用的客观规律，必须力求掌握；但是，决不是说要屈服于客观条件，而是要运用客观规律驾驭自然、征服自然，使它在一定条件下变得更加有利于生产的发展。我们既要看到各种作物对不同土地的适应性，也要看到各种土地的地形、土质都是用人力可以改造的。
    在全国大部分地区，人民公社制定土地利用规划还是一项新的工作，工作量也很大。但是，只要在党的领导下集中广大群众的智慧，充分运用群众在生产实践中积累起来的利用土地的经验；并且做好干部培训工作，使广大基层干部掌握关于土地利用的科学知识，这项工作一定能够做好。为了树立制定土地利用规划的榜样，也为了适应当前机械化和水利化的需要，可以首先有重点地做好机耕区、灌溉区的土地利用规划。山区、洼地、旱作地区、水稻地区，各类不同的地区，也都要树立起来制定土地利用规划的先进旗帜。
    春耕生产很快就要普遍展开了。今年农业生产战线上的一个突出的特点是以大搞丰产方为中心的大面积高额丰产运动和扩大耕地面积、争取全面增产相结合；要正确地划定丰产方，就要对土地利用作出全面规划。各级党委和农业部门要认真领导和切实帮助各个人民公社，把高速度地全面地发展农业生产和逐步改变农村生活面貌的雄心壮志，通过土地利用规划，生动地具体地表现出来。
