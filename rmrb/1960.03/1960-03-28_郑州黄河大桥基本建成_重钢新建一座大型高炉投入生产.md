Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 27th: The newly built Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge completed the installation of its final steel beam on the 25th, marking the successful closure of the beam erection project. With this, this double-track railway bridge spanning the Yellow River has been basically completed.

　　That afternoon, red flags fluttered at the bridgehead, and more than a thousand bridge construction workers, holding flowers, proudly flocked to Jiahetan. At 5:25 PM, Yang Haifeng, Director of the First Bridge Engineering Office of the Railway Ministry's Bridge Engineering Bureau, announced: The newly built Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is beginning to erect its final steel beam. Dozens of installation workers quickly started the cranes, and the powerful double-arm bridge machine hoisted a steel beam covered with red flags, slowly descending amidst cheers. At 6:00 PM, the steel beam was safely and accurately erected on piers No. 35 and No. 36. Instantly, cheers, firecrackers, and the sound of drums and music merged into one.

　　The newly built Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is the longest permanent double-track railway bridge designed and constructed by China itself. The bridge is nearly three kilometers long.

　　The construction of the bridge received strong support from more than 50 units across the country. Shanhaiguan and Shenyang Bridge Factories, and railway departments in Beijing, Jinzhou, Jinan, Xi'an, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, and other places actively rushed to produce steel beams and transport all materials for the bridge. Many people's communes in Henan Province, many factories in Zhengzhou and Luoyang, and other units also provided support in terms of manpower and materials, providing favorable conditions for the early completion of the bridge.

　　Currently, the bridge construction workers are working at the fastest speed to complete the finishing work, so that the bridge can be handed over to the state for use as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 25th: A newly built 620-cubic-meter large blast furnace at Chongqing Steel Company produced its first batch of molten iron on the morning of the 24th.

　　The entire production process of this large blast furnace is mechanized and equipped with advanced technologies such as high pressure, high temperature, steam blowing, and automatic instrumentation. The molten iron from the blast furnace can be directly sent to open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking, or cast into small ingots by pig iron casting machines for later use. After it is put into production, it will be connected with some small and medium-sized indigenous blast furnaces built in Chongqing since the Great Leap Forward, forming a pig iron production network combining large, medium, and small scales, greatly improving Chongqing's ironmaking capacity. This is of great significance for ensuring the completion of Chongqing's steel production tasks this year, and also creates more favorable conditions for the continued leap forward in steel production in the future.

    郑州黄河大桥基本建成
    重钢新建一座大型高炉投入生产
    据新华社郑州27日电　新建郑州黄河大桥已于25日架完最后一孔钢梁，架梁工程胜利合拢。至此，这座横跨黄河的复线铁路桥梁，已经基本建成。
    这天下午，桥头红旗招展，一千多名建桥职工，手持鲜花，怀着自豪的心情拥向夹河滩。五时二十五分，铁道部大桥局第一桥梁工程处处长杨海峰宣布：新建郑州黄河大桥开始架设最后一孔钢梁。数十名装吊工迅速地开动吊车，威力强大的双臂式桥机吊着一孔挂满红旗的钢梁，在一片欢腾声中徐徐下落。六时整，钢梁安全、准确地架设在三十五号和三十六号桥墩上。顿时，欢呼声、鞭炮声和鼓乐声汇成一片。
    新建的郑州黄河大桥，是我国自己设计、自己施工的最长的一座永久性复线铁路桥梁。桥长近三公里。
    大桥的建设得到了全国五十多个单位的大力支援。山海关、沈阳桥梁厂，北京、锦州、济南、西安、成都、郑州等地铁路部门积极为大桥赶制钢梁和运输一切物资。河南省许多人民公社，郑州和洛阳的许多工厂，以及其它单位，也都在人力、物力等方面给予了支援，为提前建成大桥提供了有利条件。
    目前，建桥职工正在用最快速度结束收尾工程，以便尽早使大桥交付国家使用。
    新华社重庆25日电　重庆钢铁公司新建的一座六百二十立方米的大型高炉在24日上午流出第一炉铁水。
    这座大型高炉的生产过程全部是机械化的，同时拥有高压、高温、蒸汽鼓风、自动计器等先进技术装备。高炉流出的铁水可以直接送到平炉炼钢，或通过铸铁机铸成小锭子备用。它投入生产之后，就同重庆市大跃进以来建成的一些中小型洋高炉连成一气，形成了一个大中小相结合的生铁生产网，大大提高了重庆市炼铁能力。这对于保证完成重庆市今年的钢产任务具有重大意义，也为今后钢铁生产的继续跃进创造了更为有利的条件。
