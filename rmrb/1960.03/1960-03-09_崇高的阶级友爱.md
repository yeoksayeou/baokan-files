    Lofty Class Friendship
    Hao Shishan, First Secretary of the Pinglu County Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Guo Fenghang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Pinglu County Committee of the Communist Party of China and County Head

    On February 3rd, when sixty-one migrant workers in our county who were building the Fengnan Highway were in imminent danger due to food poisoning, the capital sent an airplane: traveling thousands of miles, delivering medicine through the night, allowing the sixty-one comrades to avert disaster.

    Late at night, the plane appeared over our county and dropped the emergency medicine, truly "a divine doctor descended from the sky." Everyone present was moved to tears. Everyone deeply felt the boundless warmth of the socialist family, the love of the Party and Chairman Mao for us, surpassing strict fathers and loving mothers, and the class friendship of the working people, as close as brothers and sisters. Migrant worker Dong Anwa's father was so moved that he shed tears, saying to everyone he met, "Chairman Mao is truly our great benefactor, even closer than our own parents!"

    The people of our entire county are extremely grateful for the kind concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and grateful for the enthusiastic support of the military and civilians of the capital. This lofty class sentiment makes people feel the warmth of the socialist family, just as migrant worker Zhou Fulu said: "The leadership of the Communist Party is good, the socialist family is warm, and the whole country is as close as one family." The people educated by the Party and Chairman Mao are like this: when one person is in trouble, ten thousand people help; when one place is in difficulty, all directions support; everywhere shines with the brilliance of class friendship. People are connected by a red thread, and the people of the whole country share the same breath and destiny. Could such a thing exist in the capitalist society where "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs" and "heaven and earth punish those who are not for themselves"? It is absolutely impossible. In the decadent, selfish, deceitful, and cruel old society, one couldn't even dream of it.

    This incident makes us deeply feel that the people of our country, under the cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao, have formed a high degree of communist style, and the relationship between people has undergone extremely profound changes. The doctors in the hospital, in order to help patients recover their health and reduce their pain as soon as possible, personally washed and dried their clothes and quilts, washed them, and emptied their bedpans. When patients asked them to rest, they said, "Doctors are here to serve patients wholeheartedly. As long as you are not in pain, we don't mind working a little harder." They stayed by the bedside day and night. The poisoned migrant workers were all very moved, saying, "Our doctors are too good. In the old society, even if you let the doctor ride a horse and sedan chair, they wouldn't come. Today's doctors personally wash our feet, bathe us, and empty our bedpans, even our own relatives wouldn't be so close." This truly embodies the new relationship between people. Compared with the slow doctors who would prolong illnesses in the old society, and those who took advantage of others' misfortune and harmed others for their own benefit, it is simply like heaven and earth.

    This fact deeply moved and educated the people of our county. Some workers asked to participate in labor before they were fully recovered. Now, they have recovered and returned to work. The people of the whole county and all the migrant workers are even more motivated, setting off one production upsurge after another. Production efficiency has increased by 80% compared to the past. They also said: they will strive to double it and complete the Fengnan Highway three months ahead of schedule, to repay the kind concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and to repay the enthusiastic support of the people of the capital and the people of all regions!

    崇高的阶级友爱
    中共平陆县委第一书记　郝世山
    中共平陆县委书记处书记兼县长  郭逢恒
    2月3日，当我县修筑风南公路的六十一位民工，因食物中毒，危在旦夕的时刻，首都派来了飞机：千里迢迢，星夜送药，使六十一位同志化险为夷。
    深夜，飞机出现在我县上空，投下了急救药品，真是“神医天降”，当时在场的人都感动得热泪盈眶。大家深切地感受到社会主义大家庭的万般温暖，党和毛主席对我们的热爱，胜过严父慈母，劳动人民的阶级情谊，亲如手足。民工董安娃的爹激动得挂下了两行热泪，逢人便说：“毛主席，真是咱们的大恩人，真比爹娘还亲啊！”
    我们全县人民万分感谢党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀，感谢首都军民的热情支援。这种崇高的阶级感情，使人感到社会主义大家庭的温暖，正如民工周福禄所说：“共产党领导就是好，社会主义大家庭就是温暖，咱全国亲如一家人。”党和毛主席教导下的人民就是这样的：一人有事，万人相助，一处困难，八方支援；到处都闪耀着阶级友爱的光辉。人与人之间用一根红线贯穿着，全国人民都在同呼吸共命运。这样的事实，在那“各个自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”“人不为己天诛地灭”的资本主义社会里会有吗？那是万万不能的。在腐朽的自私自利的、互相欺骗残酷无情的旧社会里，连做梦也梦想不到。
    通过这件事使我们深深感到我国人民在党和毛主席的培育下已经形成了高度的共产主义风格，人与人之间的关系起了极其深刻的变化。医院的医生，他们为使病人早日恢复健康和少受痛苦，亲自为病人洗衣晒被、洗澡倒尿盆。病人请求他们去休息，他们说：“医生嘛，就是全心全意为病人服务的，只要你们不痛苦，我们辛苦点没啥。”他们日夜不眠地守在病床边。中毒的民工都万分感动，说：“我们的医生太好了，在旧社会有病，让大夫骑马坐轿都接不来。今天的大夫亲自给我们洗脚洗澡倒尿盆，就是亲人也没有这么亲。”这真是充分体现了人与人之间新的关系。同旧社会的急病慢大夫；乘人之危、损人肥己的事比起来，简直是一在天上，一在地下。
    这件事实，深深地感动和教育了我县人民，有些工人病还没完全好就要求参加劳动。现在，他们已经痊愈出工了。全县人民和全体民工干劲更大了，掀起了一个又一个的生产热潮。生产效率比过去提高80％。他们还表示：要争取翻一番，提前三个月修好风南公路，以更大的成绩来答谢党中央和毛主席的关怀，答谢首都人民以及各地人民的热情支援！
