Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Agricultural middle schools, born in the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and the great revolution in education, are growing vigorously like newborn seedlings. In the past two years, more than 30,000 agricultural middle schools (including vocational middle schools) have been established across the country, with 2.96 million students. Students in agricultural middle schools account for 27% of the total number of students in junior secondary schools nationwide.

The agricultural middle schools (including other vocational middle schools such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery) in various places were established under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Thanks to the strong support of the masses and the hard work of teachers and students, they have developed rapidly. Especially after the people's communes were established, the Party committees in various places carried out a comprehensive consolidation, improvement, and enhancement of the agricultural middle schools, and they have developed in a healthier and more solid manner. Now, almost every people's commune has an agricultural middle school, which has become an integral part of the commune.

Agricultural middle schools are an important creation in China's educational revolution. For many years, secondary education could not enter the countryside, and middle school students could not be retained in the countryside. The development of agricultural middle schools has enabled junior secondary education to take root in the countryside. Since 1959, the proportion of agricultural middle schools in the enrollment of junior secondary schools has been increasing year by year. They undertake one-third to one-half of the task of popularizing junior secondary education and have become a vital force in developing socialist secondary education and cultivating rural junior construction talents in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. With agricultural middle schools, more graduates from higher primary schools have the opportunity to continue their studies. At present, in Jiangsu, Gansu, Hebei, Liaoning, Hubei, and other provinces, about 90% of higher primary school graduates continue to study in junior middle schools. The establishment and development of agricultural middle schools have prepared good conditions for freely popularizing primary education and for developing full-time, part-time, and spare-time senior middle schools and even establishing institutions of higher learning in the countryside in the future, more quickly and in greater numbers.

In undertaking the task of popularizing education, agricultural middle schools can not only be established in large numbers and quickly, but also can be established well and economically. At present, in order to cooperate with the scientific research and technological promotion work of the people's communes, agricultural middle schools in various places are carrying out activities such as small area comparison tests, high-yield and abundant harvest tests, and weather forecasts in teaching and production labor. These activities have strengthened students' production practice, enabled them to master a lot of production knowledge and labor skills, and made them a powerful assistant to the people's communes in promoting advanced production experience and improving technical levels. Agricultural middle schools have become an important base for cultivating various junior construction talents in the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of agriculture in our country. According to a survey in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, there are currently 9,143 students in agricultural middle schools in the county, all of whom have mastered one or more sideline and handicraft production technologies. Among them, 7,100 have mastered the basic operating techniques of local farmland water conservancy, some have learned animal husbandry, fertilizer production, bacterial fertilizer, and other technologies, and some have become tractor drivers and electricians. According to statistics from sixteen schools in Taojiang County, Hunan Province, 980 graduates have been sent to communes to serve as agricultural technicians, grass-roots cadres, postal and telecommunications workers, and to factories, mines, and state-owned farms to serve as technicians. These graduates actively complete the Party's tasks in their production posts, closely contact the masses, use both hands and brains, are skilled in both civilian and military affairs, and are praised by the Party committee and the masses. Among them, 187 have been rated as production models and advanced producers.

Agricultural middle schools in various places are gradually achieving self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency due to the implementation of part-work and part-study. In Shenyang, Xinmin, Yingkou, and other cities and counties in Liaoning Province, more than half of the agricultural middle schools have completely or largely solved the teachers' salaries, school miscellaneous expenses, and students' book fees from labor income; the students' food is generally provided by the commune, and the students do some voluntary labor for the commune. Therefore, the establishment of agricultural middle schools has greatly saved education funds and students' family expenses. According to a survey in Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province in 1959, it cost the state an average of 187.64 yuan per year to train a full-time middle school student, and the family burden was 108 yuan; while an agricultural middle school student only needed a subsidy of 18.2 yuan, and the family burden was 38 yuan. Compared with the two, the cost can be saved by 90%, and the family burden can be reduced by 64.8%. With this good method of agricultural middle schools, it is possible to freely popularize junior middle school education without greatly increasing the state's financial expenditure and the burden on the masses.

Strengthening Party leadership, adhering to political command, and implementing the mass line are the fundamental keys to the continuous growth and strengthening of agricultural middle schools, this new thing. Since the people's communes were established in Jiangsu Province, the Party committee secretaries of the people's communes have generally served concurrently as principals of agricultural middle schools. Party committees at all levels have also transferred cadres to agricultural middle schools to serve as full-time principals, deans of studies, and other leadership positions. At the same time, Party and League building work has been carried out among teachers and students, ensuring the consolidation and sound development of agricultural middle schools politically and organizationally. They also adopted the method of grasping both ends and leading the middle, grasping typical examples, setting examples, and universally launching a mass movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, helping the agricultural middle schools that are doing poorly to solve various specific problems, thereby greatly changing the face of agricultural middle schools, and the agricultural middle schools in the province are getting better and better.

    三万所农业中学根深叶茂
    培养出大批手脑并用文武双全的技术人材
    农业中学是我国教育革命中的一个重要创举。它的发展，使初中教育在农村里扎下了根，并为放手普及小学教育，以及更多更快地发展全日制、半日制、业余高级中学和建立高等学校准备了良好条件。
    据新华社15日讯　在工农业生产大跃进、教育大革命形势下诞生的农业中学，像一支新生的幼苗，正在茁壮地成长。两年来，全国各地已办起三万多所农业中学（包括职业中学），拥有学生二百九十六万人。农业中学的学生已经占全国初级中等学校在校学生数的27％。
    各地的农业中学（包括林牧副渔等其他职业中学）是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下兴办起来的。由于群众的大力支持和师生的辛勤努力，发展得很迅速，特别是在人民公社化以后，各地党委对农业中学进行了一次全面的整顿巩固和提高工作，发展得更为健康、扎实。现在，几乎每个人民公社都有了农业中学，成为公社的一个组成部分。
    农业中学是我国教育革命中的一个重要创造。多少年来，中等教育进不了农村，农村里也留不住中学生。农业中学的发展，使初中教育在农村里扎下了根。1959年以来，农业中学在初级中学的招生中所占的比例逐年上升，它对于普及初中教育担负着三分之一到二分之一的任务，已经成为我国多快好省地发展社会主义中等教育和培养农村初级建设人材的一支生力军。有了农业中学，更多的高小毕业生得到升学的机会。目前，江苏、甘肃、河北、辽宁、湖北等省继续升入初级中学学习的高小毕业生占90％左右。农业中学的兴办和发展，为放手普及小学教育，并为将来在农村中更多更快地发展全日制、半日制、业余的高级中学以至建立高等学校准备了良好的条件。
    农业中学在担负普及教育的任务中，不但能够办得多，办得快，并且能够办得好，办得省。目前，各地农业中学为配合人民公社的科学研究和技术推广工作，在教学和生产劳动中，开展小区对比试验、高额丰产试验、气象预报等活动。这些活动，加强了学生的生产实践，使学生掌握了许多生产知识和劳动技能，成了人民公社推广先进生产经验和提高技术水平方面的有力助手。在我国农业机械化、水利化、电气化培养各种初级建设人材方面，农业中学已经成为一个重要基地。据河北省武清县调查，全县现有农业中学学生九千一百四十三人，他们都已经掌握一种以上的副业、手工业生产技术，其中有七千一百人掌握了当地农田水利的基本操作技术，有的学会了畜牧饲养，制造化肥、细菌肥料等技术，也有的成了拖拉机手、电机手。湖南省桃江县根据十六所学校的统计，已经输送到公社担任农业技术员、基层干部、邮电员和输送到厂矿、国营农场担任技术工人的毕业生有九百八十人。这些毕业生在生产岗位上积极完成党的任务，密切联系群众，手脑并用，文武双全，受到党委和群众的好评。其中有一百八十七人已经被评为生产模范和先进生产者。
    各地农业中学由于实行了半工半读，正在逐步实现自给或半自给。辽宁省的沈阳、新民、营口等市、县有半数以上的农业中学从劳动收益中全部和大部解决了教师工资、学校公杂费和学生的书籍费；学生的伙食一般由公社供给，学生给公社作一部分义务劳动。因此，农业中学的开办，大大节省了教育经费和学生家庭的开支。据江苏省盐城专区1959年调查，每培养一个全日制中学生平均一年需要国家经费一百八十七点六四元，家庭负担一百零八元；而一个农业中学生只需要补助一八点二元，家庭负担三十八元。两者比较，经费可以节约90％，家庭负担可以减轻64．8％。有了农业中学这个好办法，就可以在不大增加国家财政开支和群众负担的情况下，放手地普及初中教育了。
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，是使农业中学这一新生事物不断成长壮大的根本关键。江苏省自从人民公社化以来，各人民公社的党委书记一般都兼任农业中学的校长。各级党委又抽调了干部到农业中学去担任专职校长、教导主任等领导职务。同时，在师生中进行了建党建团工作，从政治上、组织上保证了农业中学的巩固和健全发展。他们还采取抓两头、带中间的办法，抓住典型，树立榜样，普遍展开一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的群众运动，帮助办得较差的农业中学解决各种具体问题，从而大大改变了农业中学的面貌，全省的农业中学越办越好。
