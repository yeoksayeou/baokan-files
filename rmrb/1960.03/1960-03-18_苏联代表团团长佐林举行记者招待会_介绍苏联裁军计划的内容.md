Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 17th: According to a TASS special correspondent in Geneva: Soviet delegation head Zorin held a press conference at the Palais des Nations after the meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee of East and West on the 16th, introducing the basic contents of the Soviet comprehensive and complete disarmament plan.

Zorin said that the Soviet comprehensive and complete disarmament proposal put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, at the United Nations General Assembly on September 18, 1959, has been submitted to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee for detailed discussion. The Soviet disarmament plan stipulates that all measures for comprehensive and complete disarmament will be implemented in three stages over four years under corresponding international supervision.

Zorin said that the Soviet Union believes that the implementation of a comprehensive and complete disarmament plan should begin with the adoption of some major measures. “In this regard, the Soviet Union's starting point is to reach an agreement on a complete cessation of all types of nuclear weapons testing before the implementation of the comprehensive and complete disarmament plan begins, thereby taking the first step towards stopping the nuclear arms race and starting nuclear disarmament.”

Zorin said: “As a major measure in the first stage of a comprehensive and complete disarmament program, it is stipulated that the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the People's Republic of China should each be reduced to 1.7 million people, and the United Kingdom and France should be reduced to 650,000 people, while other countries should be reduced to levels that the United Nations General Assembly Special Session or the International Comprehensive and Complete Disarmament Conference will agree to. … While reducing armed forces, it is also necessary to reduce the conventional armaments of various countries within the corresponding scope.” He pointed out that the aforementioned number of armed forces reductions for major powers has already been mentioned in Western countries' documents and even in Western partial disarmament plans. Therefore, these figures should not provoke opposition from Western countries.

Zorin said that the implementation of this measure means that the total number of troops of the United States and the Soviet Union will each be reduced by 700,000, and the troops of other countries will also be reduced accordingly. The experience of the Soviet Union and many Western countries shows that, from an organizational and technical point of view, it is entirely possible to reduce approximately 700,000 armed forces within twelve or eighteen months. From a political point of view, this is also completely achievable. Zorin said: “It is precisely this significant reduction in armed forces that can prove the sincerity of major powers in eliminating international tensions and prove their determination to pursue peace and establish genuine trust between countries.”

When talking about the supervision of the reduction of armed forces in the first stage of the comprehensive and complete disarmament plan, Zorin said that the Soviet plan suggests "establishing an international supervisory body to which countries will provide information about their armed forces and conventional armaments. The supervisory body will begin work when the work of disbanding the troops that should be reduced during the first stage begins in order to ensure that international inspectors check whether countries accurately and conscientiously implement the measures agreed upon for this reduction."

Zorin said that in the second stage of comprehensive and complete disarmament, the remaining armed forces of various countries should be disbanded, all military bases in other countries' territories should be abolished, and all foreign troops currently stationed in other countries' territories should be withdrawn to their home countries and disbanded. The measures in the second stage, like those in the first stage, will be implemented under strict international supervision. The Soviet Union believes that one and a half to two years at most is enough time to implement these important measures.

Zorin then said that according to the Soviet comprehensive and complete disarmament plan, in the third stage, all kinds of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons should be destroyed, and the war machines of various countries should be completely destroyed. It will take about a year to achieve all of this.

Zorin finally pointed out that the Soviet comprehensive and complete disarmament plan is a thorough plan to solve the disarmament problem in the shortest possible time.

    苏联代表团团长佐林举行记者招待会
    介绍苏联裁军计划的内容
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社特派记者日内瓦讯：苏联代表团团长佐林在东西方十国裁军委员会16日的会议结束后在国联大厦举行了记者招待会，介绍苏联全面彻底裁军计划的基本内容。
    佐林说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫于1959年9月18日在联合国大会上提出的苏联的全面彻底裁军建议已经交给十国裁军委员会详细讨论。苏联裁军计划规定，在四年内分三阶段在相应的国际监督下实现全面彻底裁军的全部措施。
    佐林说，苏联认为，应当从采取某种重大的措施开始实现全面彻底裁军计划。“在这方面，苏联的出发点是：在开始实现全面彻底裁军计划之前达成完全停止各种类型的核武器试验的协议，从而向停止核军备竞赛和开始核裁军迈出第一步。”
    佐林说：“作为全面彻底裁军方案第一阶段的重大措施，规定把苏联、美国、中华人民共和国的武装部队人数各裁减到一百七十万人，英国、法国裁减到六十五万人，而其他各国则裁减到联合国大会特别会议或国际全面彻底裁军会议将同意的水平是合理的。……在裁减武装部队的同时还必须在相应范围内裁减各国的常规军备。”他指出上述裁减大国武装部队的人数已经在西方国家的文件中，甚至在西方局部裁军方案中提到过了，因此，这些数字不应当引起西方国家的反对。
    佐林说，这一措施的实现意味着美国和苏联军队总数将各自裁减七十万人，其他国家的军队也作相应的裁减。苏联以及许多西方国家的经验表明，从组织和技术观点看来，在十二个或十八个月内裁减大约七十万人的武装部队是完全办得到的。从政治考虑出发，这也是完全可以实现的。佐林说：“正是对武装部队的这种重大裁减，才能证明大国在消除国际紧张局势方面的诚意，证明它们是否有决心奉行和平和建立各国之间真正信任的政策。”
    在谈到全面彻底裁军计划第一阶段中对裁减武装部队监督的问题时，佐林说，苏联的计划建议“设立一个国际监督机构，各国将向这个机构提供有关自己的武装部队和常规军备的情报。在解散应当在第一阶段期间裁减的部队的工作开始时，监督机构就开始工作以便保证国际监察员检查各国是否准确和认真地实现就这一裁减商定的措施。”
    佐林说，在全面彻底裁军的第二阶段，要解散各国剩下的武装部队，取消在别国领土上的一切军事基地，把目前驻在别国领土上的一切外国军队撤回本国境内并予以解散。第二阶段的措施同第一阶段的措施一样，将在严格的国际监督下实行。苏联认为，要实现这些重要措施，有一年半最多两年的时间就够了。
    佐林接着说，根据苏联的全面彻底裁军计划，在第三阶段应当消毁各种核武器和火箭武器，完全消毁各国的战争机器。为实现这一切大约需要一年的时间。
    佐林最后指出，苏联全面彻底裁军计划是在最短期间内解决裁军问题的彻底的计划。
