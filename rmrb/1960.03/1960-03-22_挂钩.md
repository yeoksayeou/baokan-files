　　Hooking Up
　　The Qingfeng Textile Factory in Wuxi adopted the method of "each department connecting, comprehensive cooperation" and established a factory-commune hooking up relationship with the Guangyi People's Commune in Wuxi County. In just over three months, the benefits of "hooking up" have become clearly apparent.
　　Factory-commune hooking up is both a technical hooking up and an ideological hooking up. Only by establishing a clear ideology of serving agriculture can we generate positive actions to support agriculture. At first, the office staff of the Qingfeng Textile Factory always felt that they had "no hook to hang," but when they went to the commune for a survey and visit, they discovered that it was not that there were no hooks to hang, but that there were many hooks that could be hung. As a result, accounting staff helped the commune strengthen financial management, establish new-style account books, and improve accounting systems; warehouse management staff helped the commune manage seed personnel and improve their management level; even nursery workers in nurseries, chefs in kitchens, and staff in clubs found specific hooking up content in the commune according to their own business nature. It can be said that if these comrades did not have a firm ideology of serving agriculture and a sincere heart to serve agriculture, these good methods would not have been conceivable.
　　Now, many factories in various regions have adopted the form of factory-commune hooking up to support agricultural production. The widespread implementation of this approach will not only further accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture economically, but also add new, deeper, and richer content to the worker-peasant alliance politically.

### 挂钩

    挂钩
    无锡庆丰纺织厂采取“条条对口，全面协作”的办法，和无锡县广益人民公社建立了厂社挂钩关系，仅仅三个多月，“挂钩”的好处，就清清楚楚地表现出来了。
    厂社挂钩，是技术上的挂钩，也是思想上的挂钩。只有树立了明确的为农业服务的思想，才可能产生积极支援农业的行动。一开始，庆丰纺织厂的科室人员总认为自己“无钩可挂”，可是当他们到公社去进行了一次调查访问，发觉不是无钩可挂，而是可挂的钩多得很。于是会计人员帮助公社加强财务管理，建立新式账册，健全核算制度；仓库管理人员帮助公社管理种子的人提高管理水平；连托儿所的保育员、厨房里的大师傅、俱乐部的工作人员都根据自己的业务性质，在公社里找到了具体的挂钩内容。可以说，如果这些同志，没有一个坚定的为农业服务的思想，没有一颗热诚的为农业服务的心，这些好办法是想不出来的。
    现在，各地许多工厂都采用了厂社挂钩的形式来支援农业生产。这种做法的普遍推行，不仅在经济上将进一步加速农业的技术改造，而且在政治上给工农联盟增加了新的、更深刻、更丰富的内容。
