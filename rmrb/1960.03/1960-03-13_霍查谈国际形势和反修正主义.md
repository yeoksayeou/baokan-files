Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 11th. Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, met with women representatives from all over Albania in Tirana on the 9th and spoke to them about the current international situation, the struggle for peace, and the opposition to modern revisionism.

    Speaking on international issues, Hoxha focused on the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and Soviet assistance to Albania and newly independent nations in Asia and Africa. Hoxha said that the Soviet Union treats all people's democratic countries and all countries in the world that have been and are being liberated from the shackles of imperialism with internationalist spirit. Hoxha said that the people of newly independent Asian and African nations have lived for centuries under the rule of bloodthirsty imperialism and colonialism, so they will never forget that imperialism is their main enemy, just as our people cannot forget that the feudalism of the past and the imperialism of today are our number one enemies. Hoxha pointed out that the people of newly independent Asian and African nations are against imperialism and colonialism, and they, along with the people of other countries, are increasingly standing on the side of the powerful forces of peace.

    Hoxha then said that Albania is very closely linked with the Soviet Union and all other people's democratic countries, and we are in complete agreement with each other in the political, ideological, and economic fields, in the struggle against the imperialist warmongers and against modern revisionism, especially against the deadly enemy of the socialist camp and the international communist movement—Yugoslav revisionism. Although modern revisionists wear masks, and although they try their best to cover up the face of revisionism, they cannot hide the vicious essence of anti-communism.

    Hoxha said that the Albanian Labor Party, taking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an example, has been and will continue to wage an unyielding struggle against the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, which is beneficial to Albania and the entire socialist camp. Therefore, we should always be vigilant against the tricks and purposes of revisionism.

    Hoxha said that modern revisionists have not changed their goals; they can only change their tactics. However, the Marxist-Leninist parties of our countries will not be deceived by these tactics. They have rich combat experience in opposing the enemies of communism and know how to oppose and expose the hostile activities of all kinds of revisionists.

    Speaking on the issue of striving for peace, Hoxha said that we should do everything possible to fight to defend peace. To this end, we should work hard to make ourselves stronger than the enemies of peace at all times and in all aspects. In order to make us strong, we must do everything possible to consolidate the political and economic position of our country. All men and women in our country should do everything possible to work and maximize labor productivity. This is a concrete and effective help to strengthen peace against war. Hoxha also emphasized that in order to defend peace, we should also be vigilant against enemies at home and abroad.

    霍查谈国际形势和反修正主义
    现代修正主义者的假面具遮掩不了他们反共产主义的恶毒本质
    为了保卫和平应当使我们在任何时候都比和平的敌人更加强大
    新华社地拉那11日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查，9日在地拉那接见阿尔巴尼亚各地的妇女代表时，对她们谈到了当前国际形势、争取和平的斗争以及反对现代修正主义等问题。
    在谈到国际问题时，霍查着重谈到了苏联的和平外交政策以及苏联对阿尔巴尼亚和对亚非民族独立国家的援助。霍查说，苏联以国际主义精神对待所有的人民民主国家和世界上所有已经和正在从帝国主义桎梏下解放出来的国家。霍查说，亚非各民族独立国家的人民接连几个世纪生活在嗜血成性的帝国主义和殖民主义的统治下，所以他们决不会忘记帝国主义是他们的主要敌人，正像我国人民不能忘记过去的封建主义和今天的帝国主义是我们的头号敌人一样。霍查指出，亚非民族独立国家的人民是反对帝国主义和殖民主义的，他们和其他各国人民一起越来越多地站在强大的和平力量这一边了。
    霍查接着说，阿尔巴尼亚同苏联和所有其他人民民主国家非常紧密地连系在一起，在政治、思想、经济方面，在反对帝国主义战争贩子和反对现代修正主义、特别是反对社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的死敌——南斯拉夫修正主义的斗争中，我们彼此都是完全一致的。尽管现代修正主义者戴着假面具，尽管他们竭力企图遮掩修正主义的面目，但是，他们遮掩不了反共产主义的恶毒本质。
    霍查说，以苏联共产党为榜样的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党曾经并将继续为反对马克思列宁主义的敌人而进行不屈不挠的斗争，这是有利于阿尔巴尼亚和整个社会主义阵营的。所以，我们对修正主义的伎俩和目的应该永远保持警惕。
    霍查说，现代修正主义者并没有改变他们的目的，他们只能改变一下策略而已。但是，我们各国马克思列宁主义政党不会被这些策略所蒙骗，它们在反对共产主义的敌人方面有着丰富的战斗经验，懂得如何反对和揭露形形色色的修正主义者的敌对活动。
    在谈到争取和平的问题时，霍查说，我们应当竭尽全力为保卫和平而斗争。为此，我们应当努力工作，使我们在任何时候、在各个方面都比和平的敌人更加强大。为了使我们强大，我们就必须尽一切可能巩固我们国家的政治和经济地位。我国所有男女应尽一切力量来劳动，来最大限度地提高劳动生产率。这对加强和平反对战争就是一个具体的有效的帮助。霍查同时强调指出，为了保卫和平，还应当对国内外敌人提高警惕。
