Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 27th: The National Urban Patriotic Health Campaign Foshan On-Site Conference called on cities nationwide to rapidly launch a high tide of patriotic health campaigns to "learn from Foshan, catch up with Foshan, and surpass Foshan." Taking the ancient city of Foshan as an example, the goal is to rapidly change the face of urban sanitation, thereby promoting urban sanitation work to a new stage, adapting to the needs of urban construction and production development, and striving to achieve the great task of eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, as proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

This conference was an experience exchange meeting and also a mobilization meeting for the great leap forward in urban sanitation work. The conference was held on the 17th and closed on the 22nd. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including directors of health departments and bureaus, and responsible comrades from Party and government departments from 25 provinces, autonomous regions, and more than 50 large and medium-sized cities.

The conference summarized the experience of Foshan City in carrying out the patriotic health campaign. The conference believes that Foshan City's patriotic health campaign, under the leadership of the CPC Foshan Municipal Committee, has vigorously promoted mass sanitation campaigns with a spirit of continuous revolution, combining production and municipal construction, grasping the key sanitary construction issues related to production and life in various periods, relying on the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties, self-reliance, utilizing local materials, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. This has rapidly changed the sanitary appearance of the ancient city, achieved great results and valuable experience, opened up a correct path for fundamentally changing the sanitary appearance of the city, and has become a red banner for urban sanitation work across the country. The representatives affirmed that Foshan's experience is not only applicable to ancient cities and small and medium-sized cities, but also worthy of good study by large cities. The meeting also widely exchanged experiences in carrying out urban sanitation work across the country. Finally, Vice Minister of Health Zhang Kai made a summary of the meeting.

The meeting pointed out that national urban sanitation work has achieved great results and rich experience in the past decade. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, urban sanitation undertakings and sanitary construction have developed rapidly. The density of the "four pests" has been greatly reduced, diseases have been significantly reduced, and the urban sanitary appearance has been significantly improved. Seriously summarizing and promoting the existing advanced experience in various places is of great significance for promoting national urban sanitation work. According to the experience exchanged at the meeting, to do a good job in urban sanitation, first of all, the Party committee must attach importance to it, the secretary must take the lead, the cadres must take the lead, combine with production, make unified arrangements, and the business departments must serve as good advisers and assistants to the Party committee. Secondly, it is necessary to have a long-term vision, establish the ambition to fundamentally change the urban sanitary appearance and thoroughly improve environmental sanitation, and according to the city's long-term plan, combined with municipal construction, vigorously carry out basic sanitary construction, and systematically solve several key issues of urban sanitation. Ancient towns should focus on the transformation and construction of sewers, the transformation of toilets, the treatment of feces, garbage and sewage, the protection of water sources and the purification of drinking water, the renovation of roads, and the reconstruction of unreasonable houses with poor lighting and ventilation. Emerging cities should focus on planning and design, and overall arrangements, so that basic sanitary construction can be built with unified consideration and unified layout when the city is built. Third, urban sanitation work must vigorously promote mass movements, grasp the problems that the masses most urgently need to solve, and with the spirit of self-reliance, resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and carrying out various basic sanitary constructions and implementing various sanitary facilities. Fourth, cultivate advanced individuals and set up pacesetters in all walks of life, summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner, continuously revolutionize, and continuously improve, so as to drive the backward with the advanced and achieve an overall leap forward. Fifth, vigorously carry out mass health knowledge education, systematically popularize and improve the health knowledge of the masses, so as to make hygiene known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts; train health backbones among the masses, cultivate the health habits of the masses, and formulate practical and feasible health systems on the basis of mass awareness, so that sanitation work is often consolidated. Sixth, all departments should care about and actively do a good job in sanitation work, and the health departments should also take the initiative to strengthen close cooperation with various relevant departments.

The meeting believes that the existing achievements in urban sanitation work are far from meeting the needs of production development and the continuous improvement of people's lives. Therefore, urban sanitation work must make an overall leap forward, transforming China's original old cities into new socialist cities with modern industry, modern science and culture, and cleanliness and beauty. Doing a good job in urban sanitation is an important measure to achieve this requirement. The meeting proposed the current tasks of urban sanitation work are: (1) To strengthen the Party's leadership and improve the leadership institutions of the patriotic health campaign, correctly handle the relationship between urban sanitation work and production, make unified arrangements, eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and vigorously control and eliminate diseases. (2) Health departments at all levels should further clarify the great significance of vigorously carrying out urban sanitation work, fundamentally change the urban sanitary appearance, and make significant achievements in environmental sanitation, industrial sanitation, school sanitation, collective welfare sanitation, and industry sanitation management in a short period of time, and do a good job in urban sanitation work at high speed, high standards, and on a large scale. (3) Conscientiously implement the policy of "treating both the symptoms and the root causes, with emphasis on treating the root causes," combine urban planning and municipal construction, vigorously treat sewage ponds and sewage ditches, eradicate sewers, investigate and treat mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and carry out harmless treatment of garbage and feces. (4) Taking hospitals as the center, further implement the policy of expanding prevention, guiding local and industrial and mining sanitation work, earnestly doing a good job in district medical and epidemic prevention work, carrying out mass health knowledge education, running spare-time health schools on a large scale, training a large number of backbones, strengthening technical guidance for urban sanitation work, and doing a good job in regular sanitation work. (5) Cities have concentrated populations, high mobility, and seasonal infectious diseases are prone to occur and spread, so we must do everything possible to actively carry out prevention and treatment. (6) While comprehensively arranging people's production and life, we must strengthen the sanitation work of collective life, do a good job in the sanitary management of the food and beverage service industry; and pay attention to solving new problems in urban sanitation work, such as the planning of residential areas, the lighting and ventilation of factory buildings, schools, and dormitories, and environmental sanitation issues such as the protection of air pollution. (7) Carry out the movement of learning from advanced and catching up with advanced, conduct regular inspections and evaluations, and decide to organize a major evaluation of urban and rural sanitation work nationwide this year, organize several major inspections, and summarize and exchange experience in urban sanitation work in a timely manner, so as to promote the continuous leap forward of urban sanitation work.

Through visits and discussions, the meeting also criticized the thinking of blindly pursuing large-scale and foreign-style in transforming the appearance of ancient cities, the lack of confidence in eliminating mosquitoes and flies, and the lack of ambition and passive waiting in urban sanitation work, and improved ideological understanding. The representatives expressed their determination to "learn from Foshan, catch up with Foshan, and surpass Foshan," promote Foshan's experience in accordance with local conditions, and let Foshan's experience blossom and bear fruit in various places.

    这次会议总结了佛山市开展爱国卫生运动的经验。会议认为，佛山市的爱国卫生运动，在中共佛山市委的领导下以不断革命的精神大搞群众卫生运动，结合生产、结合市政建设，抓住各个时期涉及生产和生活的带有关键性的卫生建设问题，依靠群众的力量克服困难，自力更生，就地取材，土洋并举，迅速地改变了古老城市的卫生面貌，取得了巨大的成绩和宝贵的经验，为根本改变城市卫生面貌，开辟了一条正确的道路，成为全国城市卫生工作的一面红旗。与会代表肯定了佛山的经验，不仅在古老城市、中小城市是适用的，而且大城市也值得很好学习。会上还广泛交流了全国各地开展城市卫生工作的经验。会议最后由卫生部副部长张凯作了总结。
    会议指出，全国城市卫生工作在过去十年中取得了巨大成绩和丰富的经验，特别是1958年大跃进以来，城市的各项卫生事业和卫生建设都有了飞跃的发展，“四害”密度大大降低，疾病显著减少，城市卫生面貌显著改善。认真总结和推广各地已有先进经验，对于推动全国城市卫生工作具有重大意义。根据各地在会上交流的经验，要搞好城市卫生工作，首先要党委重视，书记挂帅，干部带头，结合生产，统一安排，业务部门当好党委的参谋助手；其次，要高瞻远瞩，树立从根本上改变城市卫生面貌、彻底改善环境卫生的雄心大志，根据城市远景规划，结合市政建设，大搞卫生基本建设，有计划地彻底解决城市卫生的几个关键性问题，古老的城镇主要应抓好下水道的改造和兴建，厕所的改造，粪便垃圾污水的处理，水源保护和饮用水净化，道路整修，改建采光、通风等不合理的住宅；新兴的城市应着重抓规划设计，抓统筹安排，使卫生基本建设在城市兴建时就统一考虑统一布局的建设起来。第三，城市卫生工作必须大搞群众运动，抓群众最迫切需要解决的问题，以自力更生的精神，坚决贯彻土洋并举等两条腿走路的方针，举办各项卫生基本建设及实施各项卫生设施。第四，在各行各业中培养先进，树立标兵，及时总结、推广先进经验，不断革命，不断提高，以先进带动后进，全面跃进。第五，大力开展群众卫生知识教育，系统地普及和提高群众的卫生知识，作到讲卫生家喻户晓，深入人心；训练群众中的卫生骨干，培养群众的卫生习惯，在群众自觉的基础上制定切实可行的卫生制度，使卫生工作经常巩固。第六，各个部门要关心、积极做好卫生工作，卫生部门也要主动加强与各有关部门密切协作。
    会议认为，城市卫生工作现有的成绩，还远不能满足生产的发展和人民生活不断提高的需要；因此，城市卫生工作必须全面大跃进，把我国原有旧的城市改造成为具有现代工业、现代科学文化和整洁美丽的社会主义的新城市，而搞好城市卫生工作是实现这个要求的重要措施。会议提出当前城市卫生工作的任务是：（1）要加强党的领导，并健全爱国卫生运动的领导机构，正确地处理城市卫生工作与生产之间的关系，统一安排，大除四害，大讲卫生，大搞控制和消灭疾病。（2）各级卫生部门要进一步明确认识大力开展城市卫生工作的重大意义，根本改变城市卫生面貌，对环境卫生、工业卫生、学校卫生、集体福利卫生及行业卫生管理等方面都要在短时期内作出显著成绩，高速度、高标准、大面积地作好城市卫生工作。（3）认真贯彻“标本兼施，以治本为主”的方针，结合城市规划和市政建设，大搞污水塘、污水沟的处理，根治下水道，调查并处理蚊蝇孳生地，进行垃圾粪便无害化处理。（4）以医院为中心，进一步贯彻扩大预防、指导地方和工矿卫生工作的方针，切实作好地段医疗和防疫工作，开展群众卫生知识教育，大办业余卫生学校，培养大批骨干，加强城市卫生工作的技术指导，做好经常性的卫生工作。（5）城市人口集中，流动性大，季节性传染病容易发生和流行，要千方百计地积极进行防治。（6）在全面安排人民生产和生活的同时，必须加强集体生活的卫生工作，搞好饮食服务行业卫生管理；并注意解决城市卫生工作中新出现的问题，如居民区的规划，厂房、学校和宿舍的采光、通风、大气污染的防护等环境卫生问题。（7）开展学先进赶先进运动，定期检查评比，决定今年内在全国范围内组织一次城市、农村卫生工作大评比，组织几次大检查，及时总结和交流城市卫生工作经验，推动城市卫生工作不断跃进。
    通过参观讨论，会议还对改造古老城市面貌贪大求洋的思想和对消灭蚊蝇缺乏信心以及对城市卫生工作缺乏雄心大志和消极等待的思想进行了批判，提高了思想认识。与会代表纷纷表示要决心“学佛山、赶佛山、超佛山”，因地制宜地推广佛山的经验，让佛山的经验在各地开花结果。
