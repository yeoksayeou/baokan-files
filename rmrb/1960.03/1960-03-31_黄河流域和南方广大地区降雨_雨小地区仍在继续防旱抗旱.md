Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: From March 23rd to 25th, the Yellow River Basin and vast areas of the south experienced another widespread rain (snow) event. Since March 24th, the Inner Mongolia region has also generally received snow. This spring rain (snow) has greatly helped the greening and jointing of wheat, as well as spring sowing and rice transplanting. Drought conditions have been alleviated to varying degrees in many previously drought-stricken areas. However, areas with less rain and snow still feel the drought. Most areas of Hebei, Shanxi, and Gansu, as well as parts of Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia, are continuing to fight the drought. The drought in the Hainan area of Guangdong Province in the south is still relatively severe.

Since March, Henan Province has had significant rainfall south of the Yellow River, generally above 50 millimeters, while rainfall north of the Yellow River has been less, around 20 millimeters. Most areas of the province, except for northern Henan, have either been thoroughly moistened or are basically catching up. Currently, various regions are continuing to vigorously dig wells and engage in water storage activities in reservoirs, ponds, canals, dams, and fields.

In Shaanxi Province, rainfall in southern Shaanxi and a few areas in Guanzhong has reached over 50 millimeters in the past month, while rainfall in northern Shaanxi has been around 10 millimeters, and the drought situation is still quite serious. Currently, various regions are adhering to the fight against drought. As of the 25th, the province had irrigated over 30 million mu of farmland (including drought-resistant point irrigation areas).

Shanxi Province experienced widespread rain and snow from March 23rd to 24th. Rainfall in southern and southeastern Shanxi was generally above 20 millimeters, while in central and northern Shanxi it was only one or two millimeters. Due to the small amount of rainfall, the drought situation is still continuing.

Gansu Province also had rain or snow from March 22nd to 24th. Except for the Linxia area, where rainfall reached over 15 millimeters, rainfall in Pingliang, Dingxi, Tianshui, and other regions generally did not exceed 10 millimeters. Hebei Province experienced rain in areas such as Handan from March 23rd to 24th, with rainfall of five or six millimeters. Shandong Province experienced widespread light rain from March 24th to 25th, with rainfall generally a few millimeters. Rainfall in Linyi and Qingdao was higher, above 10 millimeters. Since March 24th, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also experienced snow, with precipitation generally below 10 millimeters, and only two or three millimeters in the eastern region. The above provinces and regions are currently continuing to fight and prevent drought.

Southern provinces and regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu have generally had more rainfall since March. The drought situation in most areas of Guangdong Province has been alleviated, but some areas such as Hainan Island have had less rain, and the drought is still quite severe.

    黄河流域和南方广大地区降雨
    雨小地区仍在继续防旱抗旱
    据新华社29日讯　3月23日到25日，黄河流域和南方广大地区又获得了一次范围较大的雨（雪），内蒙古地区24日以来也普遍下了雪。这次春雨（雪）对小麦返青、拔节和春播插秧都起到很大作用，不少原来受旱的地区旱情有不同程度的缓和。但雨雪较小的地区仍感干旱。河北、山西、甘肃的大部地区，河南、山东、陕西和内蒙古的部分地区仍在继续抗旱。南方广东省的海南地区干旱仍比较严重。
    河南省3月以来，黄河以南雨量较大，一般在五十毫米以上，黄河以北雨量较小，有二十毫米。全省除豫北地区外，大部地区已经透墒或基本接墒。目前各地仍在继续大打机井和大搞库、塘、渠、坝、田的蓄水运动。
    陕西省一个月来，陕南和关中少数地区雨量达五十毫米以上，陕北地区雨量在十毫米左右，旱情还较严重。当前各地在坚持抗旱斗争，到25日全省已春灌农田三千多万亩（包括抗旱点浇面积）。
    山西省23日到24日普降雨雪。晋南、晋东南雨量一般在二十毫米以上，晋中、晋北只有一两毫米，由于雨量小，旱象还在持续。
    甘肃省22日到24日也下了雨或雪，除临夏地区雨量达十五毫米以上外，平凉、定西、天水等专区雨量一般都不超过十毫米。河北省23日到24日邯郸等地下了雨，雨量五、六毫米。山东省24日到25日全省普降小雨，雨量一般几毫米，临沂和青岛市雨量较大，在十毫米以上。内蒙古自治区24日以来也下了雪，降水量一般都在十毫米以下，东部地区降水量只有两三毫米。以上省区目前仍在继续抗旱防旱。
    南方的广东、广西、福建、江西、浙江、江苏等省区3月以来雨水一般较多，广东省的大部地区旱情已缓和，海南岛等部分地区少雨，干旱仍较严重。
