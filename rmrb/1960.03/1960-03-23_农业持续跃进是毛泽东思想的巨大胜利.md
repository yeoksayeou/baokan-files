The continuous great leap forward in China's national economic construction in 1958 and 1959 and the early realization of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan once again prove the brilliance and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought, and prove that the general line for building socialism, the development speed of the great leap forward, and the organizational form of the people's commune, these three magic weapons have unparalleled power to accelerate China's socialist construction.

Since the founding of New China, Anhui's agricultural production has been developing at a very fast pace. In the eight years before 1958, the total grain output increased by 13.2% annually. In 1958 and 1959, a comprehensive and continuous great leap forward was achieved, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries all achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan stipulated by the state have been achieved or exceeded. In 1958, the total value of agricultural and sideline products in the province increased by 21.6% compared with 1957. Although the province suffered a severe drought in 1959, it still increased by 16.5% compared with the extraordinary great leap forward in 1958. The continuous leap forward in agricultural production is rapidly changing the backwardness of agricultural production.

The achievement of these achievements has been achieved through arduous struggles. Anhui has always been prone to disasters, and the disasters have been severe. In the eight years before 1958, there were six major disasters, with an average disaster-affected area accounting for about one-third of the total cultivated land each year. In 1958 and 1959, it suffered even more severe droughts that had not been seen in over a hundred years. The drought-affected area in the province reached 50 million to 54 million mu (the total cultivated land in the province is 80 million mu), and the drought lasted for more than 100 days. Six disasters in eight years, the total grain output increased by 13.2%; two years of severe drought, a comprehensive great leap forward in agricultural production, can this not be said to be a miracle?

The fundamental reason why Anhui's agricultural production has been able to continue to leap forward in the face of frequent and severe disasters is that the Provincial Party Committee has conscientiously implemented Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line for socialist construction in leading agricultural production.

**Developing the National Economy Must be Based on Agriculture**

Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee have always placed agricultural issues in a primary position. As early as 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out: "Agricultural production is the first priority of our economic construction work" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 1, page 126). In the report "On Coalition Government," Comrade Mao Zedong further clarified the importance of agriculture in the entire national economy. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the development of agricultural production must adapt to the needs of the development of socialist industrialization. In the report "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized that correctly handling the relationship between agriculture and industry is the primary issue in developing the national economy in a faster, better, and more economical way. Subsequently, in the report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "When we make plans, handle affairs, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has a population of 600 million, and we must never forget this point." He also comprehensively elaborated on the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, pointing out that "heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market"; in China's socialist construction, "the development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture." This is an extremely important policy put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applying Marxism-Leninism in China's socialist construction.

The party organizations at all levels in Anhui Province, according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, have always regarded agricultural production as the central task and primary task of the entire party in Anhui. This is because, from concrete practice, we deeply realize that developing agriculture is a top priority task, and also an arduous and complex task. Agriculture occupies a large proportion of the entire national economy, with a large agricultural population, a dispersed front, and backward production technology; moreover, the growth of crops is greatly affected by nature. In general, crops are afraid of drought and flood, frost and freezing, insects and diseases. In agricultural production, we also encounter thousands of different situations such as different regions, different soil types, different crops, and different climates. Taking the Anhui region as an example, due to various historical and geographical reasons, there are frequent and severe disasters, and even in years of good harvests, there are often shortages within the bumper harvests. If this situation is not fundamentally changed, it will inevitably seriously affect the high-speed development of the entire national economy. When the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture, it made us more clear about the important position of agriculture in the entire national economy.

In order to grasp and improve agricultural production, since liberation, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has conducted serious investigations and research on the natural conditions and historical situation of the Anhui region, the farming habits and yield-increasing experiences of the masses of peasants, and has clarified the patterns of natural disasters in Anhui and found many key measures for increasing production. The first secretaries of party committees at all levels personally grasped agricultural production and personally engaged in experimental fields. From the province to the county, agricultural leading groups have been established to specifically grasp this aspect of work, and they have never relaxed their leadership over agricultural production in the slightest. All departments have also provided strong support for agricultural production. It is precisely because of the firm implementation of the policy of basing on agriculture that not only has agricultural production achieved continuous great leap forwards in the face of major disasters, but it has also powerfully promoted the great leap forward of industry and the entire national economy.

**The Collective is Better than the Individual, and the Large Collective is Better than the Small Collective**

As early as 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong called for "organizing," pointing out that this is the only way for the people to change from poverty to prosperity. After the land reform, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong instructed to strike while the iron is hot, and continuously adopt the method of typical demonstration and gradual promotion to carry out agricultural cooperativization. In 1955, in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong discussed that to accelerate the realization of socialist industrialization, it is necessary to accelerate the realization of agricultural cooperativization, pointing out that under China's conditions, there must be cooperativization first, and then large machines can be used. Comrade Mao Zedong made a brilliant analysis of China's situation, pointing out that due to the large population, insufficient cultivated land, frequent disasters, and backward management methods, the lives of the broad masses of peasants, although improved or greatly improved compared to before the land reform, many of them still have difficulties, and many of them are still not prosperous; "for them, there is no other way out except socialism." Based on this analysis, Comrade Mao Zedong asserted that "in the national countryside, a new upsurge of socialist mass movement is about to arrive." In 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong scientifically analyzed and summarized the new situation of socialist agricultural collectivization in China and the creations of the people, and pointed out the direction of the people's commune, thus rapidly launching an extremely great people's commune movement in the national countryside.

After the land reform, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee criticized the rich peasant line of "developing the rich peasant economy first, and then engaging in cooperativization," and clearly put forward that the central task of the party in the countryside is to immediately guide the broad masses of peasants to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. In 1951, under the call of "organizing to overcome disasters," mutual aid teams with socialist buds were universally organized in the rural areas of the province, and semi-socialist primary agricultural cooperatives were established on a trial basis in 1952. In 1953, when the mutual assistance and cooperation movement was developing rapidly, a gust of "opposing rash advance" suddenly blew, and the Provincial Party Committee resolutely resisted this evil wind, proposing to oppose laissez-faire and strengthen the party's leadership over the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, thus ensuring the victorious development of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement. In the first half of 1955, some people shouted that the cooperativization movement was "too fast," "too big," and "too bad," and put forward the erroneous policy of "resolutely contracting," "quickly dismounting," and "cutting cooperative societies." The Provincial Party Committee resolutely rejected this erroneous policy and insisted on accelerating the development of the cooperativization movement. In the second half of 1955, the province achieved the cooperativization of a completely socialist nature and completed the historical task of agricultural socialist transformation ahead of schedule. By resisting the evil wind, Anhui's agricultural cooperativization movement was relatively fast and relatively good, which played a great role in ensuring disaster resistance and increased production.

In the struggle against continuous disasters and in large-scale farmland capital construction, the broad masses of peasants deeply realized that the collective is better than the individual, and the large collective is better than the small collective. Therefore, the scale of Anhui's advanced cooperatives is relatively large. In the spring of 1957, there were more than 1,000 large cooperatives with more than 1,000 households in the province, and the largest cooperative had more than 8,000 households. By the high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction in the winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958, the broad masses of peasants broke the boundaries of societies, townships, and districts, carried out communist large-scale cooperation, and felt even more that the original advanced cooperatives could not meet the needs of production development. Merging small societies into large societies became a universal mass movement. Prior to this, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee had decided to merge supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives to implement "four cooperatives in one." In the spring of 1958, agricultural cooperatives universally established industries and welfare undertakings, and some agricultural cooperatives actually implemented the integration of government and society. Thus, it prepared sufficient conditions for the establishment of people's communes. Therefore, after Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "the people's commune is good" in August 1958, the broad masses of peasants enthusiastically established people's communes, and within a little more than two months, the province realized the people's commune system. When the people's commune was first established, the province was in the tense period of vigorously developing steel, vigorously resisting drought, and vigorously grasping the three autumns. Because the people's commune planned and arranged the labor force and funds in a unified way, it mobilized the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants and finally ensured the victory of the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture and the simultaneous development of five industries, creating the miracle of increasing production even in a severe drought. In 1959, the drought in Anhui Province was more severe than in 1958, but due to the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune, it once again withstood the test of the severe drought, making the entire agricultural production greatly increase compared to the extraordinary great leap forward in 1958. "A large ship sails the rivers and seas, and a large commune is good for resisting disasters. Chairman Mao's call to establish people's communes is in line with our wishes"; "A great change in one year (referring to land reform), a great change in eight years, a great leap forward in two years, and a great change in appearance." These words profoundly reflect the personal experience of the broad masses of peasants in Anhui. Now, the people's commune organization in Anhui has been further consolidated and is constantly improving after continuous rectification. The people's commune has shown the power to turn the tide in the severe droughts of the past two years, and it will surely play a more great role in the greater and more comprehensive leap forward in the future.

**Starting with Investigation and Research to Propose Methods for Reforming Agricultural Production**

As early as in the writings on building red base areas, Comrade Mao Zedong gave many instructions on improving the conditions for agricultural production. In 1948, in his speech at the meeting of cadres in Jin-Sui, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed to improve agricultural technology to make increased production possible. In 1955, in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong instructed that improving management, improving farming techniques, and increasing means of production are indispensable conditions for ensuring increased production.

Since liberation, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has continuously adopted some key measures that "require little effort and yield great results" based on studying the characteristics of the region and the experience of the masses. In the past, it relied on mutual assistance and cooperation organizations, and in the past two years, it has relied on the people's commune organization to use these weapons to fight against nature and develop agricultural production more, faster, better, and more economically.

In the winter of 1953, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee systematically investigated and studied how serious the disasters in Anhui were, why they were so serious, compared the water-resistant and drought-resistant performance of various crops, the early and late sowing periods, and the length of the maturity periods; investigated the original farming habits of the masses and the experience of avoiding disasters and resisting drought, clarified the reasons for the frequent and severe disasters in the Anhui region and the specific laws of the occurrence of disasters, and proposed three reform measures for agricultural production (referred to as "three reforms"). Later, on the basis of the "three reforms," it summarized the experience of the great leap forward in agricultural production in the past two years, and further proposed measures such as expanding the spring sowing area, expanding the area of converting to rice cultivation, completely using improved varieties, and vigorously reclaiming wasteland. Practice has proved that spring-sown crops have higher yields than wheat stubble crops, and can avoid the droughts and floods that often occur in July and August. When spring-sown crops and summer-harvested crops have bumper harvests, about half of the annual production increase task can be completed. In this way, there is a more solid foundation for further seizing a bumper harvest in the autumn, and there is a greater certainty to complete or exceed the annual production increase task. Converting dry land to rice cultivation can increase production by more than double. Using improved varieties is an effort-saving and effective measure for increasing production. As far as Anhui's current situation is concerned, reclaiming wasteland is still an important way to increase production.

Because these measures for developing agricultural production in Anhui Province were discovered from the broad masses under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line, through systematic investigation and research, they are in line with Anhui's objective reality and reflect the urgent desire of the people of Anhui to rapidly change their appearance. Therefore, once it was put forward, it was immediately supported by the broad masses and became an effective weapon for the broad masses to fight against nature. In 1954, the grain produced and increased according to the "three reforms" was only 678 million jin, but in 1958, it reached 4.676 billion jin, and in 1959, it reached 7.394 billion jin. The thousands of farmers in Anhui enthusiastically praised the "three reforms" as "a good magic weapon for increasing production," which is completely understandable.

**Grasping Farmland Capital Construction Centered on Water and Fertilizer on the Basis of Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for Agriculture**

In his report "Our Economic Policy" in 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed to strive to lead the peasants to solve problems such as labor, fertilizer, seeds, and water conservancy, and emphasized that "water conservancy is the lifeblood of agriculture." In 1950, Comrade Mao Zedong called for "making sure to repair the Huai River well." In 1955, in the forty-article program for agricultural development drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong, twelve production increase measures were proposed, and in 1958, eight fundamental measures were extracted from them and summarized as the famous "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. The proposal of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is a new development in agricultural science. It guides people to get rid of the passive position of waiting for nature's gifts, and encourages people to further grasp the laws of agricultural production, take the initiative to fight against nature, and fight for grain with nature.

The Anhui Provincial Party Committee, on the basis of comprehensively and systematically implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," proposed to vigorously grasp agricultural capital construction centered on water and fertilizer. It also promoted the agricultural technical operating procedures based on the "Eight-Character Charter" as the outline, which not only ensured the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" and adapted to local conditions, but also made the planting activities of various major crops have relatively complete procedures like industrial production, and advanced in an orderly manner.

Vigorously grasp water conservancy. In 1953, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, based on the specific laws of the long-term suffering from drought and flood disasters in the Huaibei area, proposed the Huai River management policy of closely combining "flood prevention and dike protection," "drainage and guaranteed harvest," and "converting planting to avoid disasters." In this policy, it also emphasized "mainly storing," focusing on large-scale, mainly mass-built, medium and small-sized water storage projects on the vast plains; emphasizing the combination of water storage and converting planting, and using the characteristics of water-resistant and high-yielding crops (rice) to transform water hazards into water conservancy and transform low-yield into high-yield. From 1956 to 1958, the Provincial Party Committee summarized the water management experience and proposed that overcoming natural disasters must "take water management as the key link," and proposed the policy of "trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mainly small-scale, supported by large and medium-sized, mainly storing, and minimizing drainage." Vigorously carry out river networkization and rice cultivation in the Huaibei Plain to transform Huaibei into Jiangnan. In mountainous and hilly areas, according to the new experience in Huai River management, it emphasized vigorously carrying out water conservancy, vigorously carrying out self-flowing irrigation, and completely eliminating water conservancy dead ends that are prone to drought and flood. The water management methods formulated by the Provincial Party Committee according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee have revolutionary significance in the history of water conservancy construction. These methods greatly promoted Anhui's water management struggle. Over the past ten years, the province has completed more than 10 billion cubic meters of earth and stone, built 91 large and medium-sized reservoirs, more than 300 large culverts, and more than 730,000 small canals, reservoirs, ponds, and dams (most of which were completed in the past two years). Now, the irrigated area in the province has reached more than 61 million mu, an increase of 2.5 times compared to 1949. A large number of river network projects have been carried out on the 35,000 square kilometers of land in Huaibei; some areas have basically achieved river networkization. A large number of reservoirs, ponds, and dams have been built in Huainan and Jiangnan areas, and 11 counties that have always been prone to drought and water conservancy dead ends have basically completed water conservancy. Vigorously developing water conservancy has provided a strong material foundation for ensuring increased production in the face of disasters over the past ten years. The water management struggle in the past winter and this spring has exceeded the task, and now it is advancing victoriously, striving to pass the water conservancy hurdle in a relatively short period of time.

Vigorously grasp fertilizer. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee has always attached importance to fertilizer, trying every means to broaden fertilizer sources and improve fertilizer quality. In the past, the Provincial Party Committee summarized and promoted the "ten-character method" of accumulating fertilizer created by the masses, such as "smoking, burning, digging, exchanging, sweeping, shoveling, composting, piling, picking up, and dredging," and at the same time adopted methods such as planting (widespread planting of green manure), raising (raising more livestock and poultry), and manufacturing (vigorously developing local chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer) to open up fertilizer sources. In order to improve fertilizer quality and save labor for accumulating and transporting fertilizer, the Provincial Party Committee proposed the principle of "two on-site and one detailed," emphasizing accumulating fertilizer on-site, applying fertilizer on-site, and accumulating more high-quality fertilizer. After Comrade Mao Zedong instructed to "raise pigs in large numbers," the Provincial Party Committee, on the basis of summarizing past fertilizer accumulation experience, proposed the policy of mainly raising, combining raising, planting, accumulating, and manufacturing. Raising pigs in large numbers, building pig farms in the fields in large numbers, planting green manure in large numbers, building fertilizer composting cellars in the fields in large numbers, and vigorously developing local chemical fertilizer and chemical fertilizer; and emphasizing the use of pig manure and green manure to seal and ferment, improve fertilizer efficiency, extract biogas, and then use biogas to process pig feed to achieve small investment, great results, mutual promotion, and multiple benefits.

In addition to grasping agricultural capital construction, Anhui has also made significant achievements in converting to improved varieties, rational close planting, improving soil, field management, and eliminating pests and diseases. Deeply implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is a fundamental measure for continuing to achieve a great leap forward in agriculture.

**Mechanization is a Fundamental Measure for Developing Agricultural Production**

In his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong said that machines must be used in all departments and places where machines can be used, in order to completely change the face of the social economy. In the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the character "工" (work/industry) occupies a very important position. In the great leap forward of socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out that "the fundamental way out for agriculture lies in mechanization," and made a grand plan for the realization of agricultural mechanization in the country, "small solutions within four years, medium solutions within seven years, and large solutions within ten years."

Due to the increasing cultivated land area and replanting index, the expanding scale of farmland capital construction, and the increasingly refined farming techniques, how to improve labor efficiency and overcome the contradiction of labor shortage is a key issue in the agricultural leap forward. In order to solve this problem, in addition to requiring the scientific organization and use of labor and making reasonable layouts to save labor, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee also requires that tool reform be taken as a fundamental measure to improve labor efficiency. In the tool reform, we firmly grasped the following aspects. First, we called on the broad masses to improve their socialist consciousness, carry forward the communist style, break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do, be ingenious, and vigorously engage in innovation. Second, we focused on breakthroughs, established role models, and spread from point to area to achieve comprehensive coverage. Because water management consumes a lot of labor, the Provincial Party Committee especially grasped the reform of water management tools, established high-efficiency role models in water management, and called on all fronts to learn from the experience of the high-efficiency water management movement, and to drive the reform of agricultural tools, transportation tools, processing tools, and cooking utensils. Moreover, in all tool reforms, it emphasized that leaders should go deeper, set an example, lead from points to areas, and achieve comprehensive blooming. Third, we implemented the three-way combination of leading cadres, technicians, and production personnel with leadership as the mainstay. With leadership as the mainstay, technicians and the masses can be united politically, and the correct direction can be pointed out for the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and all aspects of the forces can be mobilized to support the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Fourth, we started from foreign countries, started from the local, combined local and foreign, and continuously improved, and gradually moved towards semi-mechanization and mechanization on the basis of realizing tool improvement. In terms of power, we made full use of wind power, water power, electricity, and animal power. Fifth, we created, identified, and promoted simultaneously, linking them tightly and consistently. The achievements of Anhui's vigorous tool reform are tremendous. In the past few years, more than 30,000 kinds of new-style tools have been created and reformed, and more than 500,000 pieces have been promoted, which has played a great role in improving labor efficiency. In the past year alone, the province saved 2 billion labor days from tool reform.

In the past few years, Anhui has grasped the pilot work of mechanization and the construction of the agricultural machinery industry. Now there are 1,250 standard tractors with 18,700 horsepower and 230,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery. A system for manufacturing and repairing agricultural machinery has been initially established. At the level of people's communes alone, there are 2,100 agricultural tool machinery factories, and at the level of production brigades, 5,700 repair stations have been established. These factories and stations are responsible for repairing new-style agricultural tools and manufacturing improved agricultural tools. Large, medium, and small machinery factories established by provinces, districts, and counties, in addition to producing new-style agricultural tools, can also produce some more complex large-scale machinery. According to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, the party organizations at all levels in Anhui have taken agricultural mechanization and modernization as one of the central tasks, planning to fundamentally change the backward state of agricultural technology in a few years and establish it on a modern technological foundation. In order to accelerate agricultural mechanization, the party organizations at all levels in Anhui resolutely implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs. While vigorously developing agricultural machinery, we vigorously developed tool reform movements; while vigorously developing foreign and modern machinery factories, we vigorously developed local, semi-local and foreign, small and medium-sized machinery factories; while accelerating the production of modern agricultural machinery, we accelerated the production of semi-mechanized agricultural tools, improved agricultural tools, and small agricultural tools. The development of the agricultural machinery industry is closely combined with the mass tool reform movement to promote the continuous improvement of the level of tool reform, and more new-style machinery is used to equip agriculture.

While accelerating the construction of the agricultural machinery industry, Anhui has also made certain achievements in vigorously developing hydropower stations and water power stations, and in vigorously developing fertilizer plants and local fertilizer plants. We believe that under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, relying on the people's commune organization, and relying on the support of the growing modern industry, we will surely greatly accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization and modernization, and completely complete the historical task of agricultural technical transformation.

The continuous leap forward in agricultural production in Anhui is a great victory of the Provincial Party Committee in implementing Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line for socialist construction in leading agricultural production. However, our study of Mao Zedong Thought is still very insufficient. In the future, we must further study Mao Zedong Thought and use it to guide the high-speed leap forward in agricultural production, apply it to the entire national economic work, and apply it to all work. We must also further consolidate and improve the people's commune system, further mobilize cadres and the masses at all levels to study the key to increasing production, vigorously engage in agricultural capital construction, accelerate agricultural technical transformation, seize a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, and promote a comprehensive leap forward in the entire national economic construction.

    农业持续跃进是毛泽东思想的巨大胜利
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　王光宇
    1958年和1959年我国国民经济建设的连续大跃进和第二个五年计划主要指标的提前实现，再一次证明了毛泽东思想的英明和正确，证明了建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式，这三大法宝对于加速我国社会主义建设具有无比的威力。
    新中国建国以来，安徽的农业生产一直是以很快的速度向前发展的。1958年以前的八年间，粮食总产量每年递增13．2％。1958年和1959年实现了全面的连续的大跃进，农林牧副渔都获得了空前的大丰收，国家规定的第二个五年计划的主要指标，都已实现或超额实现了。1958年，全省农副业总产值比1957年增长21．6％，1959年全省虽然遭到严重旱灾，仍比特大跃进的1958年增长16．5％。农业生产的持续跃进，正在迅速地改变着农业生产的落后面貌。
    这些成就的取得，是经过艰苦的斗争的。安徽一向灾多、灾重。1958年以前的八年间，共有六次大灾，平均每年受灾面积占总耕地的三分之一左右。而1958年和1959年，更遭到了百余年未有的特大干旱。全省受旱面积达五千万亩到五千四百万亩（全省总耕地八千万亩），受旱时间都延续一百余天。八年六灾，粮食总产量递增13．2％；两年大旱，农业生产全面大跃进，这不能说不是一个奇迹。
    安徽的农业生产所以能够在灾多灾大的情况下持续跃进，根本的原因是省委在领导农业生产中认真贯彻了毛泽东思想和党的社会主义建设总路线。
    发展国民经济必须以农业为基础
    毛泽东同志和党中央一贯把农业问题放在首要地位。早在1934年，毛泽东同志就明确地指出：“农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位”（“毛泽东选集”第一卷一二六页）。在“论联合政府”的报告中，毛泽东同志进一步地阐明了农业在整个国民经济中的重要性。全国解放以后，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志指出农业生产的发展必须适应于社会主义工业化发展的需要。在“关于十大关系”的报告中，毛泽东同志强调正确处理农业和工业的关系，是多快好省地发展国民经济的首要问题。随后，毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中，强调指出：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”他并且全面地阐述了农业、轻工业、重工业之间的关系，指出“重工业要以农业为重要市场”；在我国的社会主义建设中，“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”。这是毛泽东同志创造性地运用马克思列宁主义在我国社会主义建设中提出的一个极其重要的方针。
    安徽省各级党的组织根据毛泽东同志的指示，一向都是把农业生产作为安徽全党的中心任务和首要任务。这是因为从具体实践中我们深刻地认识到，发展农业是一个头等重要的任务，又是一个艰巨复杂的任务。农业在整个国民经济中占有很大的比重，农业人口众多、战线分散、生产技术落后；而且，农作物的生长又受自然界的影响很大。一般作物都怕旱怕涝，怕霜怕冻，怕虫怕病。在农业生产中，还要遇到不同地区，不同土质，不同作物，不同气候等等千差万别的情况。以安徽地区来说，由于历史的、地理的种种原因，灾多灾大，即使是丰收之年，也常常丰中有歉。这种状况如不从根本上改变，势必严重地影响整个国民经济高速度的发展。当党中央和毛泽东同志提出发展国民经济必须以农业为基础以后，使我们更加明确了农业在整个国民经济中的重要地位。
    为了把农业生产抓紧、抓好，解放以来，安徽省委对于安徽地区的自然条件和历史情况，农民群众的耕作习惯和增产经验，作了认真的调查和研究，摸清了安徽自然灾害的规律，找出了许多关键性的增产措施。各级党委的第一书记都亲自抓农业生产，亲自搞试验田。从省到县都成立了农业领导小组，具体地掌握这方面的工作，从来都没有丝毫放松对农业生产的领导。各个部门对农业生产也都进行了有力的支持。正由于坚决贯彻了以农业为基础的方针，不仅农业生产在大灾的情况下实现了连续的大跃进，而且有力地促进了工业和整个国民经济的大跃进。
    集体比个体好　大集体又比小集体好
    早在1943年，毛泽东同志便号召“组织起来”，指出这是人民群众由穷苦变富裕的必由之路。土地改革以后，党中央和毛泽东同志指示要趁热打铁，不停顿地采取典型示范、逐步推广的方法进行农业合作化。1955年，毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中，论述了要加速实现社会主义工业化，必须加速实现农业合作化，指出在我国的条件下，必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。毛泽东同志对中国的情况作了精辟的分析，指出：由于人口众多，已耕的土地不足，时有灾荒，和经营方法落后，以致广大农民的生活，虽然在土地改革以后比较以前有所改善，或者大为改善，但是他们中间的许多人仍然有困难，许多人仍然不富裕；“对于他们说来，除了社会主义，再无别的出路”。基于这一分析，毛泽东同志断言“在全国农村中，新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来”。1958年毛泽东同志又科学地分析和总结了我国社会主义农业集体化的新情况和人民群众的创造，指出人民公社的方向，因而迅速地在全国农村中掀起了极其伟大的人民公社化运动。
    在土地改革以后，安徽省委批判了“先发展富农经济，然后再搞合作化”的富农路线，明确地提出了党在农村中的中心任务，是立即引导广大农民走互助合作的道路。1951年，在“组织起来，战胜灾荒”的号召下，全省农村普遍组织了具有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组，1952年试办了半社会主义的初级农业社。1953年，当互助合作运动迅速发展的时候，忽然吹来了一股“反对急躁冒进”的歪风，省委坚决顶住了这股歪风，提出反对放任自流，加强党对互助合作运动的领导，因而保证了互助合作运动的胜利发展。1955年上半年，又有些人大叫合作化运动“搞快了”、“搞大了”、“搞糟了”，提出了“坚决收缩”、“赶快下马”、“砍合作社”的错误方针，省委坚决拒绝了这一错误方针，坚持加速合作化运动的发展。1955年下半年，全省就实现了完全社会主义性质的合作化，提前完成了农业社会主义改造的历史任务。由于顶住了歪风，安徽农业合作化运动比较快、比较好，对保证抗灾增产起了极大作用。
    在和连续发生的灾害作斗争中，在大规模的农田基本建设中，广大农民深深认识到集体比个体好，大集体又比小集体好，因此，安徽高级社的规模比较大。1957年春，全省千户以上的大社有一千多个，最大的社有八千多户。到1957年冬、1958年春大兴水利建设的高潮中，广大农民打破了社界、乡界、区界，开展了共产主义的大协作，越发感到原有的高级社不能适应生产发展的需要，把小社并成大社，便成为普遍的群众运动。在此以前，安徽省委曾决定把供销社、信用社、手工业社和农业生产合作社合并，实行“四社合一”。1958年春，农业社又普遍办起了工业和福利事业，并有部分农业社实际上实行了政社合一。这样，便为建立人民公社准备了充分的条件。所以1958年8月，毛泽东同志指出“还是人民公社好”以后，广大农民便风起云涌地大办人民公社，不到两个多月的时间，全省就实现了人民公社化。人民公社刚刚建立的时候，全省正值大办钢铁、大力抗旱、大抓三秋的紧张时期，由于人民公社在劳动力、资金方面统一筹划、统一安排，调动了广大农民的冲天干劲，终于保证了工农业并举、五业并举的胜利，创造了大旱也能增产的奇迹。1959年，安徽省的旱灾比1958年严重，但是由于人民公社发挥了无比的优越性，终于再一次经受住了特大干旱的考验，使整个农业生产比特大跃进的1958年又大有增长。“船大行江海，社大好抗灾，毛主席号召建立人民公社，正符合我们的心愿”；“一年大翻身（指土改），八年大改变，二年大跃进，面貌大改观”。这些话语，深刻地反映了安徽广大农民的切身体会。现在，安徽的人民公社组织，经过不断的整顿，已经更加巩固，并在日益提高。人民公社在两年来的大旱中显示了回天之力，在今后更大、更全面的跃进中，必将发挥更加伟大的作用。
    从调查研究入手提出改革农业生产的办法
    远在有关建设红色根据地的论著中，毛泽东同志便对改善农业生产的条件作了许多指示。1948年，毛泽东同志在晋绥干部会议上的讲话中，指示要改良农业技术，务使增产成为可能。1955年，毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中指示，改善经营管理，提高耕作技术，增加生产资料，是保证增产必不可少的条件。
    解放以来，安徽省委不断从研究本地区的特点和群众的经验出发，采取了一些“花力少，收效大”的关键性的措施。过去是依靠互助合作组织，这两年来是依靠人民公社组织，运用这些武器向自然界作斗争，又多、又快、又好、又省地发展农业生产。
    1953年冬，安徽省委系统地调查和研究了安徽的灾害究竟严重到什么程度，为什么会这样严重，比较了各种作物耐水、耐旱的性能，播种期的迟早，成熟期的长短；调查了群众中原有的耕作习惯和避灾、抗旱的经验，弄清了安徽地区所以灾多、灾大的原因和发生灾害的具体规律，提出了农业生产的三项改革办法（简称“三改”）。以后，又在“三改”的基础上总结了两年来农业生产大跃进的经验，进一步提出了扩大春播面积，扩大改种水稻的面积，全部改用良种和大力开垦荒地等措施。实践证明，春播作物比麦茬作物产量高，又可以避开常在7、8月间发生的旱涝灾害，春播作物和夏收作物丰收了，便可完成全年增产任务的一半左右。这样，进一步夺取秋季大丰收就有了更加雄厚的基础，完成或超额完成全年增产任务，就有了更大的把握。旱地改种水稻，可以增产一倍以上。改用良种更是费力少收效大的增产措施。开垦荒地就安徽目前情况来说，仍然是增加生产的一个重要途径。
    由于安徽省发展农业生产的这些措施，是在毛泽东思想和总路线的指导下，经过系统的调查和研究，从广大群众中摸索出来的，它符合于安徽的客观实际，反映了安徽人民迅速改变面貌的迫切愿望。所以一经提出，便立即得到了广大群众的拥护，成为广大群众向自然作斗争的有效武器。1954年按照“三改”办法生产而增产的粮食只有六亿七千八百万斤，1958年即达四十六亿七千六百万斤，1959年即达七十三亿九千四百万斤。安徽千千万万的农民，热烈赞扬“三改”办法是“增产的好法宝”，这是完全可以理解的。
    在贯彻农业“八字宪法”的基础上大抓以水肥为中心的农田基本建设
    1934年，毛泽东同志在“我们的经济政策”的报告中，指示要努力领导农民解决劳动力、肥料、种子、水利等等问题，并强调“水利是农业的命脉”。1950年，毛泽东同志号召“一定要把淮河修好”。1955年，毛泽东同志在他拟定的农业发展四十条纲要中，提出了十二条增产措施，1958年又从中抽出了八条根本性的措施，概括成为有名的农业“八字宪法”。农业“八字宪法”的提出，是农业科学的新发展，它引导着人们摆脱等待自然恩赐的被动地位，鼓舞着人们进一步掌握农业生产的规律，主动地向大自然开战，与天争粮。
    安徽省委在全面、系统地贯彻“八字宪法”的基础上，提出了大抓以水肥为中心的农业基本建设。并且还推广了以“八字宪法”为纲的农业技术操作规程，既保证了“八字宪法”的全面贯彻，因地制宜，又使各种主要农作物的种植活动，像工业生产那样具有比较完整的规程，有条不紊地顺序前进。
    大抓水利。1953年间，安徽省委根据淮北地区长期遭受旱涝灾害的具体规律，提出了“防洪保堤”、“治涝保收”、“改种避灾”三者密切结合的治淮方针。在这一方针中又强调“以蓄为主”，着重在广大平原上进行大规模的、以群众兴办为主的中、小型蓄水工程；强调蓄水和改种相结合，利用既耐水又高产的作物（水稻）的特性，化水害为水利，变低产为高产。1956年至1958年间，省委总结了治水经验，提出了战胜自然灾害必须以“治水为纲”的方针，提出了“相信群众，依靠群众，小型为主，大中支持，以蓄为主，尽量少排”的方针。在淮北平原大搞河网化，水稻化，变淮北为江南。在山区、丘陵地区，则根据治淮的新经验，强调大搞水利化，大搞灌溉自流化，彻底消灭易旱易涝的水利死角。省委根据毛泽东同志和党中央的指示，制定的这些治水方法，在水利建设史上具有革命的意义。这些方法大大促进了安徽的治水斗争。十年来全省共完成土石方一百多亿，兴建大中型水库九十一座，大型涵闸三百多座，小型渠、库、塘、坝七十三万多处（其中大部分是在近两年多的时间里完成的）。现在，全省灌溉面积已达六千一百多万亩，比1949年增加了二点五倍。在淮北三万五千平方公里的土地上，已经做了大量的河网工程；部分地区已经基本上实现了河网化。淮南和江南地区都兴建了大量的水库、塘、坝工程，并有十一个一向易旱的水利死角县，基本上完成了水利化。大兴水利为保证十年来的有灾能增产，提供了强有力的物质基础。去冬今春的治水斗争，已经超额完成了任务，现在正在乘胜前进，力争在较短时期内过好水利大关。
    大抓肥料。安徽省委一贯重视肥料，想尽一切办法广开肥源，提高肥料质量。过去，省委总结和推广了群众创造的“熏、烧、挖、换、扫、铲、沤、堆、拾、捞”积肥“十字办法”，同时采用种（广种绿肥）、养（多养家畜家禽）、制（大搞土化肥、细菌肥料）等办法以开辟肥源。为了提高肥料质量，节约积肥运肥劳力，省委提出了“两就一细”的原则，强调就地积肥、就地施肥、多积优质肥。毛泽东同志指示“大养特养其猪”以后，省委在总结了过去的积肥经验的基础上，提出了以养为主，养、种、积、制并举的方针。大养其猪，大建田头养猪场，大种绿肥，大建田头沤肥窖，大搞土化肥、化肥；而且强调利用猪肥和绿肥密封发酵，提高肥效，提取沼气，再利用沼气加工猪饲料，做到投资小、收效大，相互促进，一举数得。
    除抓紧农业基本建设外，安徽在改用良种、合理密植、改良土壤、田间管理、消灭病虫害等方面，也都取得了显著的成绩。深入地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，是继续取得农业大跃进的根本措施。
    机械化是发展农业生产的根本措施
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中说，必须在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。在毛泽东同志所提出的农业“八字宪法”中，“工”字占着一个很重要的地位。在社会主义建设大跃进中，毛泽东同志进一步指出：“农业的根本出路在于机械化”，并就全国实现农业机械化问题，作出了“四年以内小解决，七年以内中解决，十年以内大解决”的宏伟规划。
    由于耕地面积和复种指数日益增加，农田基本建设规模日益扩大，耕作技术日益精细，如何提高劳动效率，克服劳动力不足的矛盾，是农业跃进的一个关键问题。为了解决这一问题，安徽省委除了要求科学地组织和使用劳力，作好合理布局，以节省劳动力而外，同时要求把工具改革作为提高劳动效率的根本措施。在工具改革中，紧紧抓住了这样几个方面。一是号召广大群众提高社会主义觉悟，发扬共产主义风格，破除迷信，敢想敢干，心红手巧，大闹革新。二是重点突破，大树标兵，由点到面，全面铺开。由于治水耗费的劳动量甚大，省委特别抓住了治水工具的改革，在治水方面树立了高工效标兵，号召各个战线学习治水高工效运动的经验，把农具改革、运输工具改革、加工工具改革、炊具改革带动起来，而且在所有的工具改革中，都强调领导深入一点，作出样子，以点带面，全面开花。三是贯彻以领导为主的领导干部、技术人员和生产人员三结合。领导为主，便可以从政治上把技术人员和群众团结起来，为技术革新和技术革命运动指出正确的方向，动员各方面的力量支持技术革新和技术革命运动。四是从洋处着眼，从土处着手，土洋结合，不断提高，在实现工具改良化的基础上，逐步向半机械化、机械化迈进。在动力方面，充分利用风力、水力、电力、畜力。五是边创造、边鉴定、边推广，环环扣紧，一以贯之。安徽大搞工具改革的成绩是巨大的，几年来共创造和改革了各种新式工具三万多种，推广了五十多万件，这对提高劳动效率起了很大作用，仅去年一年，全省就从工具改革中，节省了二十亿个劳动日。
    几年来，安徽抓紧了机械化的试点工作和农业机械工业的建设，现在已有拖拉机一千二百五十个标准台，一万八千七百马力，排灌机械二十三万马力，初步建立了农业机械的制造和修配系统。全省仅人民公社一级就办了农具机械厂二千一百个，大队一级就办起了修配站五千七百个。这些厂、站担负了修配新式农具和制造改良农具的任务。省、专、县建立的大、中、小型机械厂，除了生产新式农具，还能生产一部分较为复杂的大型机械。根据毛泽东同志和党中央的指示，安徽各级党的组织已把农业机械化、现代化作为中心任务之一，计划在若干年内根本改变农业技术的落后状况，使之建立在现代化的技术基础上。为了加速农业机械化，安徽各级党的组织坚决贯彻了土洋并举，两条腿走路的方针。在大搞农业机械的同时，大搞工具改革运动；在大办洋的、现代化的机械工厂的同时，大办土的、半土半洋的、中小型的机械工厂；在加速生产现代化农业机械的同时，加速生产半机械化的农具、改良农具、小农具，把农业机械工业的发展和群众性的工具改革运动密切结合起来，促进工具改革的水平不断提高，用更多的新式机械来装备农业。
    在加速农业机械工业建设的同时，安徽在大办水电站、水力站方面，大办化肥厂、土化肥厂方面，都已取得了一定的成绩。我们相信：在党中央和毛泽东同志英明正确的领导下，依靠人民公社组织，依靠日益壮大的现代工业的支持，我们一定可以大大地加快农业机械化、现代化的进程，彻底完成农业技术改造的历史任务。
    安徽农业生产持续跃进，是省委在领导农业生产中贯彻毛泽东思想和党的社会主义建设总路线的巨大胜利。但是，我们学习毛泽东思想还是很不够的，今后还要进一步学习毛泽东思想，把它用来指导农业生产的高速度跃进，运用到整个国民经济工作中去，运用到一切工作中去。我们还要进一步巩固和健全人民公社制度，进一步发动各级干部和群众研究增产关键，大搞农业基本建设，加快农业技术改造，夺取农业生产更大、更全面的跃进，促进整个国民经济建设的全面跃进。
