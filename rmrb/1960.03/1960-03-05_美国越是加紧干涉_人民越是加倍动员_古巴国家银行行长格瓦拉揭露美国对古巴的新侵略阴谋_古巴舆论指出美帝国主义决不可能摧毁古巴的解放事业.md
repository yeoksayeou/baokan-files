Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 2nd -- Che Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, said in a report to the student militia at the University of Havana tonight that the United States is preparing to invade Cuba and is planning new invasion plans, because this small colony in the Caribbean is impolitely saying things that only revolution can say, and demanding equal treatment. He said that the small, bearded figure, which originally appeared in American cartoons as a symbol of the Cuban revolution, is growing stronger in the Americas, and this is even inevitably reflected in the visits of dollar owners to Latin America. Whenever a nation wants to express its desire for liberation, they raise a picture of Castro as a symbol. This shows that we enjoy the highest status among the people of Latin America, who see in us all the noble and fighting spirit of the Cuban people.

Guevara condemned the United States' price policy in purchasing Cuban sugar as "economic enslavement" of Cuba, which has reduced Cuba to a "semi-colony" relying on a single economy, forcing Cuba to obtain "all its needed consumer goods from foreign markets."

He said that the United States purchases Cuban sugar at "so-called preferential prices" and then imposes preferential tariff conditions on Cuba in industrial products, "so that the products of Cuba itself and other countries are unable to compete with it." Guevara pointed out that the United States is instigating economic aggression against the Cuban government. He also said that Cuba's signing of trade and loan agreements with the Soviet Union is an effort by Cuba to "free its economy from complete dependence on sugar."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 3rd -- The imperialist behavior of the United States in attempting to threaten Cuba by reducing Cuba's sugar quota has aroused great indignation in Cuban public opinion.

Cuban labor leader Lazaro Peña said in a statement: The Cuban working class expresses great indignation at this imperialist threat. Neither Latin America nor the world will tolerate this threat.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation, various labor federations, and trade unions have all condemned the US imperialist plan to oppose Cuba's independent economic development.

The Cuban Revolutionary Directorate pointed out in its statement: In the face of the new aggression of US imperialism against the Cuban people, the people of Latin America and the world have expressed legitimate indignation. The Cuban National Tobacco Harvesters Association and many other mass organizations have also protested.

Today's "Revolución" published the full English text of the draft law to reduce Cuba's sugar quota in the United States, which has already been approved by Eisenhower. The newspaper condemned the United States for attempting to attack Cuba economically precisely when the Cuban government suggested resolving the problems between the two countries through negotiations. The newspaper said that this bill has revived the era of the "big stick." "National Daily" emphasized in its editorial that Eisenhower is unwilling to negotiate, but only attempts to economically suffocate the Cuban revolution.

According to today's report, rebel soldiers fired at another small plane from the United States flying over the Trinidad sugar factory in Las Villas province, forcing the plane to scurry away.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 3rd -- Cuban capital newspapers today strongly condemned the United States' threats of military and economic provocation against Cuba.

"Hoy" pointed out that the purpose of the large-scale military exercises conducted by the United States in the Caribbean region is to "demonstrate" in the Caribbean in order to overcome the wavering of Latin American governments in succumbing to Washington's policies, isolate Cuba, and intimidate the Latin American people. "Hoy" said that although they attempt to intimidate the people of Latin America, the only thing they will gain is the redoubled mobilization of the people of Latin America to support the Cuban revolution.

"Combate" commented that the reason why the United States refused to study the outstanding issues between the two countries has been clarified today, because it has announced the dispatch of 18,000 American soldiers to the Caribbean region and announced that the US Congress will pass a law to cut the limit of sugar cane imported from Cuba by 192,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 2nd -- Cuba's "Combate" published an editorial on March 2nd on Eisenhower's trip to South America, saying that Eisenhower's visit added another chapter to the history of the massive interference, aggression, and threats carried out by the US authorities against the people of Latin American countries. The editorial pointed out that if Eisenhower thinks he can conquer Cuba's national sentiments and make Cuba submit, he is also wrong. They can surround us, slander us, and attack us, but they cannot destroy the cause of Cuba's liberation.

    美国越是加紧干涉　人民越是加倍动员
    古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉揭露美国对古巴的新侵略阴谋
    古巴舆论指出美帝国主义决不可能摧毁古巴的解放事业
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉今天晚上在哈瓦那大学给学生民兵作报告时说，美国正准备对古巴实行侵略，并且计划着新的侵略计划，因为这个加勒比海的小小殖民地正在不礼貌地讲着只有革命才能讲的话，并且要求平等相待。他说，那个最初出现在美国漫画上的象征着古巴革命的矮小的大胡子，正在美洲壮大起来，这一点甚至不可避免地反映在美元所有者在拉丁美洲的访问中。每当一国人民想表达他们要求解放的愿望时，他们就举起卡斯特罗的像作为标志。这就表明，我们在拉丁美洲人民中享有最高的地位，他们在我们身上看到了古巴人民的一切崇高的和斗争的精神。
    格瓦拉谴责美国在购买古巴食糖方面的价格政策是对古巴的“经济奴役”，它使古巴沦为依靠单一经济的“半殖民地”，迫使古巴不得不从“外国市场获得它所需要的全部消费品”。
    他说，美国以“所谓的优惠价格”购买古巴食糖，然后把在工业品方面的优惠关税条件强加于古巴，“以便使古巴本国和其他国家的产品无力与之竞争”。格瓦拉指出，美国正在策动对古巴政府的经济侵略。他还说，古巴同苏联签订贸易和贷款协定是古巴为了使“经济摆脱完全依赖糖”的局面而作的一种努力。
    据新华社哈瓦那3日电　美国企图用降低古巴糖的分额来威胁古巴的这种帝国主义行径，激起了古巴公众舆论的极大愤慨。
    古巴工人领袖拉萨罗·培尼亚发表谈话说：古巴工人阶级对于帝国主义的这种威胁表示极大愤慨。无论是拉丁美洲还是全世界，都不会容忍这种威胁。
    古巴工人联合会、各工人联合会和工会都谴责美帝国主义反对古巴独立发展经济的计划。
    古巴革命指导委员会在它发表的声明中指出：面对着美帝国主义对古巴人民的新侵略，拉丁美洲和世界各国人民表示了正当的愤慨。古巴全国烟草收获者协会和其他许多群众团体也提出了抗议。
    “革命报”今天刊载了已经得到艾森豪威尔赞同的减少古巴在美国的糖定额的法律草案的英文全文，报纸谴责美国恰恰在古巴政府建议通过谈判来解决两国间问题的时候，企图从经济上攻击古巴。报纸说，这个法案使“大棒”时代又复活了。“国民日报”在社论中强调说，艾森豪威尔不愿意谈判，而只企图从经济上窒息古巴革命。
    据今天报道，起义军士兵向又一架在拉斯维利亚斯省特立尼达糖厂上空飞行的来自美国的小飞机开枪射击，迫使这架飞机鼠窜而逃走。
    据新华社哈瓦那3日电　古巴首都报纸今天强烈地谴责美国对古巴进行军事和经济挑衅的威胁。
    “今日报”指出，美国在加勒比海地区大规模地进行军事演习的目的是在加勒比地区“示威”，以便克服拉丁美洲政府对屈从华盛顿政策的动摇状态，孤立古巴和恫吓拉丁美洲人民。“今日报”说，虽然他们企图恫吓拉丁美洲人民，但是他们所能获得的唯一东西将是拉丁美洲人民加倍地动员起来，支持古巴革命。
    “战斗报”发表评论说，美国拒绝研究两国间悬而未决问题的理由今天澄清了，因为它已经宣布派一万八千名美国士兵到加勒比地区，并宣布美国国会将通过一项法律，把从古巴进口的蔗糖限额削减十九万二千吨。
    据新华社哈瓦那2日电　古巴“战斗报”3月2日就艾森豪威尔的南美之行发表社论说，艾森豪威尔的访问在美国当权者对拉丁美洲各国人民所进行的大量干涉、侵略和威胁的历史上又增添了一章。社论指出，如果艾森豪威尔认为可以征服古巴的民族感情而使古巴屈服的话，他也错了。他们可以包围我们，诽谤我们，进攻我们，但是却不可能摧毁古巴的解放事业。
