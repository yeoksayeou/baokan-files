Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 3rd: Wuhan Iron and Steel's ironmaking system workers held another "one-dragon" joint technology performance competition in late February. In nine days, with the common goal of high-yield and high-quality pig iron, they vigorously carried out technological innovation and revolution, and vigorously promoted communist collaboration, increasing the average daily output of pig iron by 922.6 tons compared to January.

This performance competition lasted from February 21st to 29th, with workers from 21 units participating, including the ironmaking plant, various mines, machinery, power plants, and related offices. The company established an ironmaking command headquarters to lead the overall work; each unit, with the goal of high-yield and high-quality pig iron, created conditions in all aspects to achieve this goal. Due to the high confidence and great enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, they further grasped the key and tackled the key, further deepening technological innovation and revolution. After the start of the performance competition, the workers of the ironmaking plant identified 346 key items, large and small, within two days, of which 164 belonged to the blast furnace. They immediately solved 48 items, which played a significant role in improving the daily output level.

The improvement of blast furnace smelting intensity put forward new requirements for raw material production, power systems, thermal engineering systems, and equipment maintenance departments. These departments actively took measures to vigorously support the blast furnace. The various mines guaranteed the supply of ore and limestone, the coking plant promptly supplied high-quality metallurgical coke, the transportation department quickly picked up and delivered raw materials, the power plant took the initiative to contact and deal with problems, and the machinery plant timely arranged for the blast furnace spare parts. This enabled the continuous rise in blast furnace production.

Now, the workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel's ironmaking system are advancing victoriously. They are determined to further increase the output of pig iron, ensure the early and overfulfillment of the first quarter's production plan, and strive for first place among the nation's giant blast furnaces.

    一条龙联合技术表演赛掀起生产新高潮
    武钢生铁日产量增加九百多吨
    新华社武汉3日电　武钢炼铁系统职工2月下旬又一次举行了一条龙联合技术大表演赛。他们在九天的时间里，以生铁高产优质为共同目标，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大搞共产主义协作，使生铁的平均日产量比1月份提高了九百二十二点六吨。
    这次表演赛从2月21日起到29日止，有炼铁厂、各矿山、机械、动力总厂及有关处室共二十一个单位的职工参加。公司成立了炼铁指挥部，领导全盘工作；各个单位以生铁高产优质为目标，从各个方面为实现这个目标创造条件。由于广大职工信心高，干劲大，进一步大力地抓关键、攻关键，使技术革新和技术革命进一步深入。炼铁厂职工在表演赛开始后，两天之内就查出大小关键三百四十六项，其中属于高炉的有一百六十四项，马上解决了四十八项，对日产水平的提高起了很大作用。
    高炉冶炼强度的提高，对原料生产、动力系统、热工系统、设备维修部门，都提出了新的要求。这些部门都积极采取措施，大力支援高炉。各个矿山保证了矿石和石灰石的供应，焦化厂及时供应了质量良好的冶金焦，运输部对原料取送迅速，动力厂主动联系处理问题，机械总厂对高炉备品备件及时进行了安排。这样就使高炉生产不断上升。
    现在，武钢炼铁系统的职工正在乘胜前进。他们决心进一步提高生铁产量，保证提前超额完成第一季度生产计划，在全国巨型高炉中争第一。
