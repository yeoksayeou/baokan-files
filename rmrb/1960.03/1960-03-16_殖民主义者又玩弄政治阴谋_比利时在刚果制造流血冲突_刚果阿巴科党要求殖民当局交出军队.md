Xinhua News Agency, March 15th, Elisabethville Dispatch: Belgian colonialists recently created another bloody conflict between Africans in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province in the Congo, and used this as an excuse to send military police to suppress it. According to statistics from the colonial authorities, thirteen Africans died, hundreds were injured, and about five hundred Africans were arrested by the Belgian authorities in this incident.

According to Belgian news agencies, this incident was a provocation by the CONAKAT party, which represents the interests of Belgian monopoly consortia, against Patrice Lumumba, chairman of the Congolese National Movement. Lumumba arrived in Elisabethville on the 11th and prepared to hold a mass rally there the next day, but was prohibited by the colonial authorities. That evening, the local situation began to become tense, and bloody incidents followed on the 12th and 13th.

After the armed conflict between the two parties, the Belgian colonial authorities immediately declared a state of "military occupation" and took the opportunity to mobilize police and troops to suppress it. Police and patrols in jeeps patrolled the city, using tear gas and making arrests everywhere. The Elisabethville city authorities also announced a city-wide curfew.

Reports say that the Belgian authorities also deployed aircraft to coordinate with ground forces during the suppression. One aircraft crashed.

This incident occurred after the Belgian government had already agreed that the Congo would achieve independence on June 30th this year, and therefore attracted attention. During the round table conference in Brussels to discuss the future of the Congo, Belgian monopoly consortia attempted to use the representatives of the CONAKAT party attending the meeting to split the wealthy Katanga Province from the Congo, which was unanimously condemned by the representatives of the Congolese nationalist parties.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th, Leopoldville Dispatch: As the Congolese general election draws nearer, the ABAKO party demanded on the 14th in its party publication "Our Congo" that the Belgian colonialists immediately hand over the army.

The party said, "Now is the time for the Belgians to hand over the security forces (colonial army)."

It is reported that there are currently 15,000 Belgian colonial troops in the Congo, led entirely by officers of the Belgian army. These forces are equipped with armored vehicles, reconnaissance aircraft, mortars, and machine guns. These colonial troops have long been a tool for Belgian colonialists to rule and suppress the African people.

    殖民主义者又玩弄政治阴谋
    比利时在刚果制造流血冲突
    刚果阿巴科党要求殖民当局交出军队
    新华社15日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：比利时殖民主义者最近又在刚果加丹加省的首府伊利沙伯维尔制造了非洲人之间的流血冲突事件，并且以此为借口派遣军警前往镇压。据殖民当局的统计，在这次事件中，有十三名非洲人死亡，几百人受伤，另有约五百名非洲人被比利时当局逮捕。
    据比利时通讯社透露，这次事件是代表比利时垄断财团利益的科纳卡党对刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴进行的一次挑衅行动。11日卢蒙巴到达伊利沙伯维尔，并准备第二天在那里举行一次群众集会，但是遭到殖民当局的禁止。当天晚上，当地的局势就开始紧张，在12日和13日接着发生了流血事件。
    在两个政党之间的武装冲突发生后，比利时殖民当局立即宣布“军事占领”状态，乘机动员警察和军队进行镇压。坐着吉普车的警察和巡逻队在市内四处巡逻，他们使用了催泪弹，并且到处捕人。伊利沙伯维尔市当局还宣布全市戒严和实行宵禁。
    有消息说，比利时当局在镇压时还出动了飞机在空中同地面部队联络。有一架飞机失事坠毁。
    这次事件发生在比利时政府已经同意刚果在今年6月30日实现独立之后，因此引起人们的注意。在布鲁塞尔举行圆桌会议讨论刚果前途问题期间，比利时垄断财团就曾企图利用出席会议的科纳卡党的代表把富饶的加丹加省从刚果分裂出去，结果遭到刚果民族主义政党代表的一致谴责。
    新华社15日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：随着刚果大选日益接近，阿巴科党14日在党的机关刊物“我们的刚果”上要求比利时殖民者立即交出军队。
    这个党说，“现在是比利时人交出治安部队（殖民军队）的时候了”。
    据报道，在刚果的比利时殖民军队现有一万五千人，完全由比利时军队的军官率领。这些部队装备有装甲车、侦察机和迫击炮、机关枪。这些殖民军队长期以来是比利时殖民者统治和镇压非洲人民的工具。
