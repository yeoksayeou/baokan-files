Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese government and people welcome and fully support the Nepalese government's consistent policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs. He said: The Chinese government is willing to further strengthen cooperation with the Nepalese government and jointly make more contributions to safeguarding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and world peace. Prime Minister Koirala said that problems between countries can be resolved through negotiations and direct contact, because negotiations and direct contact naturally lead to a friendly atmosphere. The Prime Minister said that his visit to China will lead to further development of friendly relations between the two countries. The speeches by the Premier and the Prime Minister were warmly welcomed.

The Nepalese Minister of Engineering and Transport, Ganesh Man Singh; Minister of Home Affairs and Justice, Surya Prasad Upadhyaya; Foreign Affairs Secretary, Nara Pratap Thapa; Secretary of Commerce and Industry, Vishwa Shankar Shukla; Major General Chetra Bikram Rana; Member of the Upper House, Maniharsha Jyoti; and the Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Kumar Mani Acharya Dixit, who accompanied Prime Minister Koirala on his visit, were all invited to the banquet. Also invited to the banquet were the Nepalese Consul General in Lhasa, Basnyat, and the Nepalese journalist delegation headed by Pa. De. Pande, the editor-in-chief of "New Society News."

Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Premiers of the State Council Bo Yibo and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Pan Zili all attended the banquet.

The grand banquet was held in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. Premier Zhou Enlai first gave a speech at the banquet. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he expressed a warm welcome and sincere respect to the distinguished guests.

The Premier said that China and Nepal are friendly neighbors. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries and the establishment of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles guiding the relations between the two countries, we have not only restored contact, but also continuously developed our friendship on a new basis. The development of friendly relations between China and Nepal is by no means accidental; it is the common aspiration of the people of the two countries and the interest of the people of both countries.

The Premier said: China and Nepal are both ancient countries and very young countries. The people of our two countries have inherited the tradition of mutual sympathy and support in the past struggle for national independence and against colonialism, and today they are conducting increasingly broad cooperation in the cause of national construction and the maintenance of world peace.

The Premier stated: The Nepalese government has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs. His Honorable Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed out that the Nepalese government has decided to adopt an independent neutral policy, will not participate in any military blocs under any circumstances, and will resolutely implement the well known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government and the people welcome and fully support this wise policy of the Nepalese government, because this policy not only conforms to the interests of the Nepalese people, but also helps to promote Asian-African solidarity and world peace. The Chinese government has always unremittingly adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has consistently advocated resolving all outstanding issues with other countries, especially with neighboring countries, through friendly consultation. Time and history have proven, and will continue to prove, that this policy of the Chinese government is firm and unshakable. We are pleased to see that this policy of the Chinese government has gained the trust and understanding of the Nepalese government and people. The Chinese government is willing to further strengthen cooperation with the Nepalese government and jointly make more contributions to safeguarding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and world peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying: I believe that your friendly visit will help to further consolidate and develop the friendship between our two countries, and will help to promote the unity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

Prime Minister Koirala then delivered a speech. He said: For the past three days, the Chinese government and people have given me a warm welcome and cordial hospitality, which has allowed me to personally experience your friendship and goodwill towards Nepal and the Nepalese people. This is indeed very satisfying to me.

The Prime Minister said: The fundamental problem facing our two countries is the development of the country. Although our political systems are different, Nepal and China both accept the principles of peaceful coexistence as the basic policy guiding relations between countries. We have the same goal of comprehensively developing our own countries, and we are making our best efforts to develop our countries as soon as possible to the best of our ability.

The Prime Minister said: As everyone knows, our foreign policy is a foreign policy of friendship and neutrality. We believe that not aligning with any power bloc, not participating in military alliances, and expressing opinions based on the merits of each international issue will help promote world peace. We also believe that world peace is a necessary condition for the economic development and prosperity of underdeveloped countries. Therefore, for the benefit of all, we support world peace. I believe that problems between countries can be resolved through negotiations and direct contact, because negotiations and direct contact naturally lead to a friendly atmosphere. I fully agree with Your Excellency's opinion that all differences on international issues should be resolved through peaceful negotiations. I believe that my visit to China will prove this once again and lead to further development of our friendly relations.

During the speeches of the Premier and the Prime Minister, there were bursts of warm applause in the hall. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of Nepal and China respectively.

When Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast at the banquet, he proposed a toast to the friendship between China and Nepal, to the further development and consolidation of our two countries' friendly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to the solidarity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

When Nepalese Minister of Home Affairs and Justice Upadhyaya proposed a toast, he proposed: to the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to the eternal friendship and unity of Asian and African countries, to the promotion of the cause of world peace, and to the eternal prosperity and strength of the People's Republic of China. Nepalese Minister of Engineering and Transport Singh proposed in his toast: To the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Nepal and China, two friendly countries, and to the upcoming meeting of the Prime Ministers of our two great friendly nations—China and India.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China were also invited to the banquet. The head of the diplomatic corps, Afghan Ambassador to China Samad, proposed a toast at the banquet on behalf of the diplomatic corps, proposing a toast to the prosperity and happiness of the people of China and Nepal, to the maintenance and development of friendship by governments and people of all countries, and to world peace.

    总理说：中尼两国都是古老的国家，又是十分年轻的国家。我们两国人民继承了过去在争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争中相互同情、相互支持的传统，今天又在国家建设和维护世界和平的事业中进行着日益广泛的合作。
