Crossing the Silver Bridge to the Golden Bridge
——Record of the Leap Forward Development of the Baofeng People's Commune in Ningxia
Han Daoren整理 (Compiled by Han Daoren)

    The Baofeng People's Commune in Shizuishan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is a joint Hui and Han commune formed by merging the original ten advanced agricultural cooperatives. The entire commune has seven brigades, 4,466 households, and 21,884 people, including 2,395 Hui households with 11,282 people. The entire commune is located at the tail end of four Yellow River irrigation canals, with low terrain, much water accumulation, high water levels, and severe soil salinization. Coupled with a small population and abundant land, cultivation has always been rough, making it a low-yield area.
    Starting from mutual aid teams in 1950 until the realization of communization in 1958, agricultural production and people's lives underwent tremendous changes. Taking 1957, the year before communization, as an example, the average grain yield of the Quyang Advanced Cooperative reached 202 jin, more than double that before liberation. Due to the rapid increase in members' income, their lives also underwent significant changes. In Fugui Village at the time of liberation, 63 households with 296 people had only 24 quilts, and 11 households had no houses to live in. In 1957, the number of houses in Fugui Village increased from 137 at the time of liberation to 201, and in 1958, it increased to 261.

    **Great Changes in One Year**
    The Hui and Han people of the Baofeng Commune were not satisfied with the achievements after cooperativization; they demanded greater development and improvement in production. The many problems encountered in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 made them deeply realize that to further develop production, it was necessary to break the limitations of advanced cooperatives. The Central Committee's resolution on establishing people's communes struck a chord with the commune members, and applications and pledges poured into the advanced cooperatives and township government like a tide. After consultations among cadres and discussions among the masses, people's communes were established on the basis of advanced agricultural cooperatives. After its establishment, the people's commune unleashed the tremendous power of "larger size and higher degree of public ownership." Many things that the original advanced cooperatives could not do are now being done. Production income and the lives of commune members have undergone significant changes. In 1959, the total grain output of the commune reached 21,914,556 jin, an increase of 61.06% compared to 1957, and an increase of 43.52% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The total income will reach more than 2.9 million yuan, an increase of 95.37% compared to 1957 and 65.63% compared to 1958. The portion of the 1959 distribution to commune members will reach 1,461,810 yuan, more than double that of 1957 and 78.45% more than 1958.
    With the high-speed development of production, public accumulation and production investment also increased rapidly. Public accumulation in 1959 increased 3.5 times compared to 1957, and two tractors, twelve disc harrows, and other new agricultural tools were purchased. After communization, due to the implementation of a distribution system combining wages and supply, not only was it guaranteed that 96% of households increased their income, ensuring the lives of the vast majority of commune members, but also the problem of overdraft households from previous years was solved. At the end of 1957, there were 567 households with savings, and the total amount of savings was 5,289 yuan. In the first nine months of 1959, the number of savings households increased fivefold, and the total amount of savings increased twenty-fivefold.
    With the development of production and the increase in income, collective cultural and welfare undertakings have also developed rapidly. 97% of school-age children in the commune were enrolled in schools, an increase of 56% compared to 1957. The commune also had 94 middle school students and 6 university students. Due to the consolidation and development of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, health clinics, and maternity hospitals, all commune members not only had no worries about food and clothing, but also liberated more than 2,500 women from cooking stoves, grinding stones and millstones.

    **Three Major Contradictions Readily Solved**
    After communization, by breaking the limitations of the original advanced cooperatives and uniformly planning land use and water drainage, further realizing planting according to local conditions, cultivation was facilitated, labor and animal power were saved, and production was increased.
    Because brigades differed in soil quality, terrain, land occupation, and production technology, the crops suitable for planting also differed. Therefore, the yields per unit area varied greatly. Even during the advanced cooperative period, each cooperative had to plant some of each type of crop, regardless of the yield. In 1959, before spring planting, the commune Party committee classified and ranked the land throughout the commune, uniformly planned crop planting, and determined planting plans according to the characteristics of each brigade. Miaotai Brigade, which was suitable for planting more autumn grain, increased its autumn grain area from 5,613 mu in 1958 to 7,796 mu; Yinhe and Quyang Brigades, which were suitable for planting more summer grain, expanded their summer grain planting area; Baofeng Brigade, which was suitable for planting hemp and vegetables, increased its hemp and vegetable planting area from 430 mu in 1958 to 958 mu. Other wasteland and lakes were also fully utilized.
    In order to facilitate cultivation, the commune also solved the problem of interspersed plots. The entire commune adjusted a total of 1,072 mu of interspersed plots. In the past, these lands had low yields for years due to inconvenient and rough cultivation. This situation was well known, but it was impossible to solve during the advanced cooperative period. After the establishment of the commune, this problem was solved very smoothly. After the land adjustment, distant land became nearby land, making it easy to process, fertilize, and manage. The interspersed plot of Baofeng Brigade in Quyang Brigade only yielded more than 80 jin of millet per mu in 1958. After being adjusted to Quyang Brigade in 1959, it yielded 410 jin of wheat per mu, increasing the total grain output by more than 100,000 jin.
    Before communization, there were some contradictions in the issues of ditch digging, water use, and drainage between advanced cooperatives, as the upstream and downstream or left and right banks were not a single economic unit, and water sources could not be fully utilized. Some projects could not be constructed due to poor mutual consultation. After communization, due to the unified planning for improving the water supply and drainage system and the unified arrangement for the planting and water use of summer and autumn crops, the contradictions between brigades were resolved, and water was relatively saved and irrigation and drainage were rationally managed.

    **Victory in Transforming Nature**
    Because people's communes have a wide organizational scope, a large population and great strength, they have enhanced the ability to resist natural disasters and transform nature. Things that could not be done during the advanced cooperative period can now be done.
    Saline-alkali land accounted for 60% of the total cultivated land in the commune, which was the biggest threat to agricultural production increase. During the advanced cooperative period, due to the small size and weak strength of the cooperatives, only small-scale digging and drainage could be carried out, which had little effect. In December 1958, the commune mobilized 705 laborers to dig drainage ditches. After the winter and spring construction, a 24.5-kilometer-long main drainage ditch was completed. Major brigades dug many small branch ditches and capillary ditches. With the improvement and strengthening of the drainage system, the groundwater level generally dropped, and salinization was significantly reduced. The entire commune drained more than 10,000 mu of accumulated water, turning 4,790 mu of bad land that originally did not sprout or sprouted very little into fertile fields.
    The "Huihui Canal" and "Tie Canal," which were responsible for irrigating more than 6,600 mu of the entire commune, were silted up every year, and the upper reaches could not communicate with the lower reaches. The Yinhe and Xinghuo Brigades, which benefited from the canals, did not have the strength to dig deeper and widen them. Therefore, a considerable part of the land had to be irrigated by means of third- and fourth-level water lifting. In order to help these two brigades, in the spring of 1959, Dongyonggu, Miaotai, Baofeng, and Xingsheng Brigades took the initiative to support Yinhe and Xinghuo Brigades in opening up the Huihui Canal and Tie Canal, turning more than 2,700 mu of land irrigated by water lifting into self-flowing irrigation. Yinhe Brigade unprecedentedly planted 440 mu of rice.
    On May 19, 1959, there was a late frost, and 43.9% of the commune's crops were affected. This kind of disaster was difficult to save in the past. After the disaster, the commune Party committee immediately organized a rush-planting commando team of more than 3,200 people, concentrated on working hard for five days in the most severely affected areas, replanting all the crops, replanting suitable crops, without delaying the farming season or affecting production increase.

    **Two Major Reforms in Cultivation Technology**
    In agricultural production, in addition to fully implementing various measures to increase production, two reforms were particularly focused on: One was to change low-yield crops to high-yield crops. Due to the habitual planting of millet, the yield of millet was low, and the increase in production was relatively small. After communization, due to the unified planning of the commune, the planting of high-yield crops such as rice and corn was increased. In 1959, the output increased by four to ten times compared to 1958. After corn was planted, it encountered seed mildew, frost, and damage from "ground tigers." Most of it was planted twice, and a few even planted three times. In the face of these disasters, thanks to the strong leadership of the commune Party committee and the tenacious struggle of the vast number of commune members, a bumper harvest was finally achieved, with a yield of 450 jin per mu, nearly double the yield of millet.
    Another reform was livestock sheds and manure accumulation methods. In the past, because livestock pulled manure everywhere in the sheds, and the manure accumulation method was "often without padding, padding only half of the circle," without adding decayed compost, not only was less manure accumulated, but the quality was also poor. After communization, Quyang Brigade was first used as a key point, with the key point as a school, four training courses and three observation meetings were held. Then, specialized teams for renovating sheds were organized with brigades as units, and specialized groups for livestock breeding and manure accumulation were organized in each team. In a very short period of time, the old sheds in the commune that were originally covered with some firewood were changed into new sheds that did not leak rain or snow at all, and the soil troughs were changed into brick troughs. In addition, 2,356 composting pits were dug, and the method of composting manure, grass, and soil in a rational proportion in a three-pit circle was universally implemented. After the change in sheds and manure accumulation methods, the quantity and quality of manure accumulation increased significantly. The fertilizer accumulated in the winter of 1959 has basically met the needs of the base fertilizer for the spring planting of 1960.

    **Diverse Economy in Full Bloom**
    The Baofeng Commune not only had a significant increase in grain production, but also achieved rapid development in cash crops, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, commune-run industries, and handicrafts. The planting area of cash crops such as vegetables, oil crops, and hemp increased by 60.4% in 1959 compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. It is estimated that the total output of vegetables will increase by more than thirty times compared to 1958, and hemp will increase by 3.3 times. Compared with the end of 1958, animal husbandry saw less breeding of cattle and donkeys, with the total number of heads being equal. Camels increased by 11.33%; sheep increased by 57.7%; pigs increased by two times; and chickens and ducks increased by four times. On the basis of the large-scale steel smelting in 1958, small-scale industries, handicrafts, and sideline production developed rapidly. The commune's directly affiliated industries include six small factories such as agricultural tool repair, papermaking, and lime, and two small coal mines were opened. The total industrial output value for the year will account for about 13.45% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The development of industry and handicrafts has played a significant role in the development of agricultural production. In the first nine months of 1959 alone, 12,569 pieces of agricultural tools of various sizes were manufactured and repaired for agricultural production, providing 31,000 yuan in funds for agriculture.
    Now, full-time cadres in various industries have been identified at all levels from the commune to the team, and specialized teams or groups for animal husbandry, industry, sideline occupations, vegetables, hemp, and horticulture have been organized according to the characteristics of major brigades and teams. The technical expertise of the vast number of people has been fully utilized, and the labor enthusiasm of commune members has been unprecedentedly high, with model deeds of love for the collective constantly emerging.

    **Hui and Han Commune Members Join Hands in a Leap Forward**
    Among the seven brigades in the entire commune, Dongyonggu, Miaotai, and Xingsheng Brigades are relatively wealthy; Quyang, Yinhe, Baofeng, and Xinghuo are poor brigades. The difference between rich and poor brigades reflects the de facto inequality in economic development between Hui and Han residents. Before communization, although the economy and culture of the Hui people had developed rapidly, the scope of operations and strength of the advanced cooperatives were small, so mutual support and learning between poor and rich brigades and between Hui and Han people were greatly restricted, and the gap between the rich and poor remained large. Since communization, although it has only been a little over a year, the differences between rich and poor brigades have been greatly reduced while developing together. According to 1959, the average income per person in Quyang Brigade will catch up with the average income per person in Miaotai Brigade, and the average grain possession per person is equivalent to 72% of the average possession per person in Miaotai Brigade. The average grain yield per mu is the same as that of Miaotai Brigade, and the average possession of draft animals and agricultural tools has basically caught up with the level of Miaotai. Although the production and income of Xinghuo, Yinhe, and Baofeng are still lower than those of rich brigades by 16.87% to 27%, the difference has been significantly reduced compared to the past.
    The reason why such great achievements can be achieved in such a short period of time is that the commune has strengthened its leadership, especially the leadership over the poor brigades, the poor brigades have worked hard to improve themselves, and the rich and poor brigades have cooperated and supported each other, encouraging and promoting each other. After communization, Quyang Brigade first proposed the fighting slogan of "Surpassing Xinghuo and Catching up with Miaotai," and Xinghuo Brigade worked hard silently and refused to fall behind. A competition movement to catch up with the rich brigades and for the rich brigades to help the poor brigades was launched throughout the commune. The current situation is that poor brigades take the lead everywhere and strive to be upstream in everything; rich brigades also do not relax and try every means to tap potential. The state's 70,000 yuan investment in the commune was distributed to the four poor brigades at 70%, and the commune also extracted 31,000 yuan of public accumulation and lent it to the poor brigades interest-free. All of these not only helped the poor brigades overcome their difficulties, but also greatly encouraged the cadres and commune members. With the narrowing of the economic gap between rich and poor brigades and the strengthening of mutual cooperation and support between Hui and Han commune members, the awareness of commune members has been unprecedentedly improved, and the unity between brigades and between Hui and Han people has also been unprecedentedly strengthened. In the summer of 1959, Yinhe Brigade, where the Hui people lived, lacked seeds when replanting late autumn crops due to the disaster, and Xingsheng Brigade took the initiative to supply 60,000 jin of seeds. During the summer levy, Xingsheng Brigade proactively borrowed 90,000 jin of wheat from Yinhe, Dongyonggu Brigade because the wheat had not been harvested yet, and transported it to the granary by car. In Baofeng Brigade, where the Hui people live, and Miaotai Brigade, where the Han people live, commune members used these few sentences to praise the unity and mutual assistance relationship after communization: "Baofeng and Miaotai are neighbors, but there was very little contact in the past. Since communization, mutual support has made us closer and more affectionate."

    The facts of the past year of communization have further strengthened the belief of the Hui and Han people of the Baofeng People's Commune in following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, continuing to consolidate and improve the people's commune, and resolutely taking the socialist road. At present, the vast number of cadres and commune members are more energetic, and their political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm are unprecedentedly high. Under the shining light of the general line of socialist construction, they are fighting to achieve a continued leap forward in 1960 and to build a more prosperous and happy new countryside.

    过了银桥走金桥
    ——记宁夏宝丰人民公社的飞跃发展
    韩道仁整理
    宁夏回族自治区石嘴山市宝丰人民公社是一个回、汉族联合社，由原来的十个高级农业社合并组成。全社共有七个大队，四千四百六十六户，二万一千八百八十四人，其中回族二千三百九十五户，一万一千二百八十二人。全社处在四条引黄灌溉渠的最末梢，地势低、积水多、水位高、土壤盐渍化严重，加上人少地多，历来耕作粗糙，因此，是个低产区。
    从1950年的互助组开始，到1958年实现公社化以前，农业生产和人民生活都有了巨大的变化。以公社化的前一年——1957年为例，当时渠羊高级社的粮食平均单产就达到了二百零二斤，比解放前提高二倍多。由于社员收入的迅速增长，社员的生活也有了突出的变化。解放时的富贵村，六十三户、二百九十六人，只有二十四条被子，有十一户人家没房子住。1957年富贵村的房子由解放时的一百三十七间增加到二百零一间，1958年增加到二百六十一间。
    一年来的巨大变化
    宝丰公社的回汉族人民，并不满足合作化后的成就，他们要求生产有更大的发展和提高。是1958年大跃进中遇到的许多问题，使他们深刻地体验到要进一步发展生产，就必须打破高级社的限制。党中央关于建立人民公社的决议的公布，正好打中了社员们的心坎，申请书、决心书，像潮水一样涌到了高级社和乡政府。经过干部协商和群众讨论，随即在高级农业社的基础上建立起了人民公社。人民公社成立后，发挥了“一大二公”的巨大威力。很多原来高级社办不到的事，现在办到了。生产收入和社员生活都起了突出的变化。全社1959年粮食总产量达到二千一百九十一万四千五百五十六斤，比1957年增长61．06％，比大跃进的1958年增长43．52％；总收入将达到二百九十多万元，比1957年增长95．37％，比1958年增长65．63％；1959年的社员分配部分将达一百四十六万一千八百一十元，比1957年增长一倍多，比1958年增长78．45％。
    随着生产的高速度发展，公共积累和生产投资也增加得很快。1959年的公共积累比1957年增长三点五倍，并且购置了两台拖拉机、十二台圆盘耙和其它新式农具。公社化后，由于实行了工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，不仅保证了96％的户增加收入，使广大社员的生活有了保障，历年的超支户问题也解决了。1957年底，社员存款的有五百六十七户，存款的总额是五千二百八十九元。而1959年的前九个月，存款户增长了五倍，存款总额增长了二十五倍。
    随着生产的发展和收入的增加，集体文化福利事业也得到了迅速发展。全社97％的适龄儿童入了学，比1957年增长56％；全社还有中学生九十四名，大学生六名。由于公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、卫生所、妇产院等集体福利事业的巩固发展，所有社员不仅可以吃穿不愁，把二千五百多名妇女从锅台、磨台、碾台下解放了出来。
    三大矛盾迎刃而解
    公社化以后，由于打破了原来高级社的限制，统一规划了土地利用和用水排水，进一步实现了因地种植，既便利了耕作，节约了劳力、畜力，又增加了生产。
    各队由于土质、地势、土地占有和生产技术都有差别，适宜种植的作物也不同。因此，单位面积产量相差很悬殊。就在高级社的时候，每个社不管产量高低，各样作物也都要种一些。1959年，公社党委在春播以前就对全社土地进行了分类排队，统一规划了作物种植，按照各队特点，确定播种计划。适宜多种秋粮的庙台队，秋粮面积由1958年的五千六百一十三亩增加到七千七百九十六亩，适宜多种夏粮的银河、渠羊队，扩大了夏粮播种面积；适宜种大麻、蔬菜的宝丰队，播种大麻、蔬菜的面积由1958年的四百三十亩增加到九百五十八亩。其它如荒地湖泊也得到了充分利用。
    为了便于耕作，公社还解决了插花地的问题。全社共调整插花地一千零七十二亩，这些土地过去由于耕作不便、耕作粗糙，历年来产量很低。这种情况是人所共知的，但在高级社时期却无力解决。公社成立以后，很顺利地解决了这个问题。土地调整以后，远地变成了近地，便于进行加工施肥和管理。宝丰队在渠羊队的插花地，1958年每亩只收八十多斤糜谷，1959年调整给渠羊队以后，每亩收四百一十斤小麦。共增产十多万斤粮食。
    公社化以前，高级社之间修渠、挖沟、用水、排水的问题，由于上下游或左右岸不是一个经济单位，存在着一些矛盾不能充分利用水源。有些工程由于相互协商不好而不能兴修。公社化以后，由于对改善输水排水系统作了统一规划，对夏秋作物的种植和用水排水作了统一安排，因而解决了队与队之间的矛盾，相对地作到了节约用水，合理排灌。
    改造自然的胜利
    人民公社由于组织范围广，人多力量大，增强了抵抗自然灾害、改造自然的能力，高级社时期办不到的事情现在能够办到了。
    全社盐渍土地占耕地总面积的60％，是农业增产的最大威胁。高级社时期，由于社小力薄，只能小挖小排，收效很小。1958年12月，公社调配了七百零五个劳力，挖排水沟，经过了冬春两季施工，挖成了长二十四点五公里的排水干沟。各大队开挖了许多小支沟和毛沟。随着排水系统的健全和改善，地下水位普遍下降，盐渍化显著减轻。全社排除积水万余亩，使四千七百九十亩原来不出苗或出苗很少的坏地变成了良田。
    担负着全社六千六百余亩灌溉任务的“回回渠”和“铁渠”，年年淤塞，上通下不通。受益的银河、星火两个大队，没有力量深挖和加宽。因此，有相当一部分土地不得不用三、四级提水灌溉的办法。为了帮助这两个队，1959年春季东永固、庙台、宝丰、兴胜大队主动支援银河、星火大队打通了回回渠和铁渠，把二千七百余亩提水灌溉的地变成了自流灌溉。银河大队破天荒地播种了四百四十亩水稻。
    1959年5月19日来了一场晚霜，全社43．9％的作物受灾，这种灾害在过去是难以挽救的。受灾以后，公社党委立即组织三千二百多人的抢种突击队，集中在受灾最严重的地区苦战五天全部重种，补种了适龄作物，没误农时，没影响增产。
    耕作技术的两大改革
    在农业生产上，除了全面贯彻各项增产措施之外，突出抓住了两项改革：一是改低产作物为高产作物。这里由于习惯种植糜谷，糜谷的产量低，增产幅度比较小。公社化以后，由于公社统一计划，增种高产作物的水稻和玉米，1959年比1958年增产四倍到十倍。玉米种下以后，遇到了籽种霉烂、霜冻和“地老虎”为害，多数种了两次，少数连种三次。在这些灾害面前，由于公社党委的坚强领导，广大社员的顽强战斗，终于获得了特大丰收，每亩产量达到四百五十斤，比糜谷单产提高将近一倍。
    另一个改革是牲畜圈棚和积肥方法。过去由于牲畜在圈内到处拉粪，又是采取“经常不垫，一垫半圈”，不加腐熟沤制的积肥方法，不但积肥少，而且质量差。公社化后，先把渠羊队做重点，以重点为学校，开了四次训练班、三次观摩会，接着以大队为单位组织了改造圈棚专业队，各小队组织了牲畜饲养和积肥专业组，在很短时间内，把全社原来只用些柴草搭盖的老圈棚，改成完全不漏雨雪的新圈棚，把土槽改成了砖槽。并且挖掘了二千三百五十六个沤肥坑，普遍实行了一圈三坑，粪、草、土合理配成，沤制腐熟的积肥方法。圈棚和积肥方法改变后，积肥的数量、质量有显著上升。1959年冬天积存的肥料已经基本上满足1960年春播底肥的需要。
    多种经济满堂红
    宝丰公社不仅粮食增产显著，经济作物、畜牧业、副业、社办工业、手工业也得到了迅速发展。蔬菜、油料、大麻等经济作物的播种面积1959年比大跃进的1958年扩大60．4％。预计菜蔬总产量将比1958年增长三十倍以上，大麻增长三点三倍；畜牧业和1958年年底相比，除牛、驴繁殖较少，总头数相等外，骆驼增长11．33％；羊增长57．7％；猪增长二倍；鸡、鸭增长四倍，在1958年大炼钢铁的基础上，小型工业、手工业和副业生产发展得都很快。公社直属工业，有农具修配、造纸、石灰等六个小型工厂，开挖了两处小煤矿。全年工业总产值将占到工农业总产值的13．45％左右。工业和手工业的发展，对农业生产的发展起了很大作用。仅1959年前九个月就为农业生产制造、修配大小农具一万二千五百六十九件，为农业提供资金三万一千元。
    现在，从公社到小队层层确定了各行各业的专职干部，根据各大队和小队的特点，组织有畜牧、工业、副业、蔬菜、大麻、园艺等专业队或专业组。充分发挥了广大群众的技术特长，社员的劳动积极性空前高涨，热爱集体的模范事迹不断涌现。
    回汉族社员携手跃进
    在全公社的七个大队中，东永固、庙台和兴胜等三个队比较富裕；渠羊、银河、宝丰、星火是穷队。穷富队之间的差别，反映了回、汉族居民在经济发展上的事实上的不平等。公社化以前，回族人民的经济和文化虽然有了飞快的发展，但是由于高级社经营范围小，力量弱，因而穷富队之间、回汉族之间的相互支援、学习，受到很大限制，穷富差别仍然很大。公社化以来，虽然只有一年多时间，穷富队在共同发展的同时，差别已经大大缩小。按1959年，渠羊大队每人平均收入将赶上庙台大队每人平均收入的水平，每人平均占有粮食相当于庙台大队每人平均占有量的72％，粮食平均单产和庙台大队相平，耕畜、农具的平均占有量也基本上赶上了庙台的水平。星火、银河、宝丰的生产和收入虽然还低于富队16．87％至27％，但是相差的距离已比过去显著缩小。
    在这样短的时间内，所以能够取得这样大的成绩，是公社加强领导，特别是加强对穷队的领导，穷队发奋图强，穷富队相互协作支援，互相鼓励促进的结果。公社化后，渠羊大队首先提出了“超星火、赶庙台”的战斗口号，星火大队更是埋头苦干，不甘落后。在全社范围内掀起了穷队赶富队，富队帮穷队的竞赛运动。现在的情况是，穷队处处带头，事事力争上游；富队也毫不松懈，千方百计地挖掘潜力。国家对公社的七万元投资，以70％分配给四个穷队，公社还抽出三万一千元公共积累无息贷给穷队，所有这些，不仅帮助穷队克服了困难，并且对干部社员起了极大的鼓舞作用。随着穷富队之间经济差别的缩小，回、汉社员之间相互协作支援的加强，社员觉悟的空前提高，队与队之间、回族与汉族之间的团结也空前加强了。1959年夏天，回民聚居的银河队由于受灾，重种晚秋作物时缺乏种籽，兴胜队等主动供给籽种六万斤；夏征时兴胜队由于麦子没有打出来，银河、东永固队等就主动借给小麦九万斤，并用车给送到粮库里。在回民聚居的宝丰队和汉民聚居的庙台队，社员用这样几句歌来赞美公社化后的团结互助关系：“宝丰庙台是近邻，过去来往少得很；自从有了公社化，相互支援亲又亲。”
    公社化一年来的事实更加增强了宝丰人民公社回、汉族人民跟着共产党和毛主席，继续巩固提高人民公社，坚决走社会主义道路的信念。当前广大干部和社员干劲更加充沛，政治热情和劳动积极性空前高涨，正在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，为实现1960年继续跃进，为建设更加繁荣幸福的新农村而奋战。
