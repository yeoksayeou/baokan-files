Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th: Shaanxi Province is actively combating drought to ensure early cotton planting and good sowing; Shandong has built over one million heated beds to cultivate sweet potato seedlings; Anhui is preparing spring crop seedlings such as early rice and sweet potatoes ahead of schedule; Cotton-producing areas in Hebei are vigorously establishing high-yield plots in preparation for planting cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th: Various regions in Shaanxi Province have successively convened on-site meetings and meetings of representatives from "Autumn Fragrance Fields" to conduct thorough inspections and comparisons of cotton field preparation work. Mobilizing the masses to address the current drought and the new situation of expanding high-yield plots, they are adopting methods of controlling drought early and vigorously promoting new technologies to improve the quality of preparation work and sowing time, ensuring a successful sowing season.

The cotton field preparation work in Shaanxi Province this year is better than in previous years in terms of deep plowing, irrigation, soil preparation to conserve moisture, and fertilization. The area of cotton fields with base fertilizer applied accounts for 72%, and an average of 25 to 30 jin of high-quality cotton seeds have been carefully selected per mu. On average, there is one row seeder per 100 mu in major cotton-producing areas. In light of the current situation in the province where the drought continues to develop, the ground temperature is high, and pests and diseases may appear earlier, the key to current cotton field preparation is how to ensure that land is prepared and moisture is conserved early according to the planned area, and to ensure early and good cotton planting.

On February 15, Sanyuan County proposed to cotton-producing areas throughout the province the initiative to focus on water, plant cotton well, and carry out a high-yield competition for large areas of cotton. The cotton-producing areas throughout the province responded enthusiastically, and Weinan, Dali, and other counties in the main cotton-producing areas launched large-scale inspections and comparisons of cotton field preparation.

In response to the drought situation, various regions in Shaanxi Province have vigorously expanded the irrigated area of cotton fields this year. Up to now, the area of cotton fields with irrigation facilities in the province has expanded from more than 1.6 million mu actually irrigated last year to 2.7 million mu, accounting for 60% of the planned cotton planting area.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th: Shandong Province plans to expand the area planted with sweet potatoes this year compared to last year. At present, people's communes in various places are enthusiastically rushing to build sweet potato seedling-raising heated beds and carrying out a campaign to raise sweet potato seedlings early, raise more seedlings, and raise strong seedlings, striving for timely transplanting of sweet potatoes and ensuring complete seedlings at one time.

According to statistics, most of the more than 500,000 sweet potato seedling-raising heated beds planned to be built in the Liaocheng and Jining Special Zones in southwestern Shandong have been completed, and many sweet potatoes have been placed on the beds for heating and germination; in Zibo Special Zone and Jinan City in central Shandong, more than 535,000 sweet potato seedling-raising heated beds have been built, completing more than 90% of the plan; Yantai Special Zone, where the sweet potato cultivation season is later, also started the heated bed construction activities earlier this spring, and the completed heated beds account for more than 50% of the planned number. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Agriculture as of the 3rd of this month, of the 2.47 million sweet potato seedling-raising heated beds planned to be built in the province, 1.53 million have been completed, with 1.04 billion jin of sweet potato seeds placed on the beds.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 12th: Various regions in Anhui are adopting a variety of effective seedling-raising methods to resolve the current contradictions of heavy spring plowing production tasks, strong seasonality, low temperatures, and tight stubble rotation, and are carrying out seedling-raising work for spring-sown crops such as early rice, sweet potatoes, and cotton ahead of schedule.

At present, more than 1 million jin of early rice seedling seeds have been sown throughout the province, more than 120 times more than in the same period last year; more than 500 million jin of sweet potato seeds have been raised, about three times more than in the same period last year, and cotton-producing counties have also started cotton seedling-raising work.

The planting area of various spring-sown crops in Anhui Province this year will be much larger than last year. Among them, the planned area of high-yield crops such as early rice and sweet potatoes will be expanded by one to two times compared to last year. Therefore, party committees in various places have been focusing on the preparation of seedling raising since before and after the Spring Festival, comprehensively promoted various simple and easy-to-use seedling raising methods, and trained a large number of seedling raising experts and popularized various seedling raising technologies through methods such as holding on-site meetings and running training courses.

The seedling-raising work of spring sweet potatoes in various places started even earlier. Now, people's communes in various parts of the province have built 500,000 hotbeds and more than 110,000 heated beds and soil greenhouses. The early-raised sweet potato seedlings have all germinated and are growing evenly and vigorously.

This year's cotton planting task in the province is also very heavy. According to local experience, early-sown cotton can generally increase production by 20% to 30% compared to summer-sown cotton. In order to solve the contradiction of stubble rotation, various places have universally promoted the square-block seedling-raising method and the nutrient pot seedling-raising method, which can not only raise seedlings early and sow early in a timely manner, but also ensure strong seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: The broad masses of cadres and commune members in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei are vigorously grasping the preparatory work for cotton planting; and establishing high-yield cotton plots to drive the preparation work for cotton planting to be done quickly and well. At present, many cotton-producing communes are stepping up spring irrigation of cotton fields to eliminate spring drought, while actively establishing greenhouses to cultivate cotton seedlings for some cotton fields planned for seedling transplanting. Neiqiu County in Handan Special Zone has already raised more than 155 million seedlings, creating conditions for early cotton growth, early boll setting, and early boll opening, and striving for a bumper harvest in cotton fields.

The vigorous development of the high-yield plot movement has effectively promoted the preparation work for cotton planting in various places. By the end of February, more than 73% of the cotton fields in the province had been deep-plowed, and the deep-plowed area exceeded three times that of last year; the area where base fertilizer was applied also increased significantly compared with the same period last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied was generally about 7,000 jin per mu, and more than 10,000 jin for high-yield fields. Thanks to the vigorous development of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, 70% of the cotton fields in the province now have water conservancy facilities, and the area of cotton fields that can be irrigated has expanded by 33% compared to last year.

    选好种育壮苗　力争及早春播
    陕西大力抗旱保证棉田早播种播种好　山东修起一百多万个热炕培育甘薯苗
    安徽提早培育早稻甘薯等春作物种苗　河北产棉区大搞丰产方准备播种棉花
    据新华社西安12日电　陕西省各地纷纷召开现场会议、“秋香田”代表会议，大查大比棉田备耕工作。动员群众针对当前干旱和丰产方扩大的新情况，采取以早治旱，大力推广新技术的方法，提高备耕工作质量和播种时间，保证过好播种关。
    陕西省今年的棉田备耕工作，无论在深翻、灌溉、整地保墒、施肥都比往年好。棉田施底肥面积占72％，每亩平均已精选优良棉种二十五到三十斤。主要产棉区平均百亩有一架条播机。根据当前全省旱象仍在持续发展，地温高，病虫害可能提早出现的情况，如何保证按计划面积提早整地保墒，保证及早种好棉花，就成为当前棉田备耕中的关键。
    2月15日，三原县向全省产棉地区提出以水为纲，种好棉花，开展棉花大面积高产竞赛的倡议。全省各产棉区纷纷响应，主要产棉区的渭南、大荔等县都展开了棉田备耕的大查大比活动。
    针对干旱情况，陕西省各地今年都大力扩大棉田灌溉面积。到现在为止，全省有灌溉设施的棉田已由去年实际灌溉的一百六十多万亩，扩大到二百七十万亩，占棉田计划播种面积的60％。
    据新华社济南12日电　山东省今年计划种植的甘薯面积比去年扩大。目前，各地人民公社正在热火朝天地赶修育苗热炕，开展甘薯早育苗、多育苗、育壮苗运动，力求甘薯适时移栽，一次全苗。
    据统计，鲁西南地区的聊城、济宁专区计划修建的五十多万个甘薯育苗火炕，大部分已经建好，并有许多甘薯已上炕加温催芽；鲁中地区的淄博专区和济南市，已建成甘薯育苗火炕五十三万五千多个，完成计划90％以上；栽培甘薯季节较晚的烟台专区，今春建炕活动也较早，建成的火炕已占计划数的50％多。据省农业厅截至本月3日统计，全省计划修建的二百四十七万个甘薯育苗火炕，已建成一百五十三万个，上炕薯种有十亿四千万斤。
    据新华社合肥12日电　安徽各地采取多种有效的育苗办法，解决当前春耕生产任务大、季节性强、气温低、茬口紧等矛盾，提早进行早稻、甘薯、棉花等春播作物的育苗工作。
    目前全省已播种早稻育苗种子一百多万斤，比去年同期多一百二十多倍；已育甘薯种子五亿多斤，比去年同期多三倍左右，棉产县也开始了棉花育苗工作。
    安徽省今年各种春播作物种植面积要比去年扩大很多。其中，高产作物早稻和甘薯，计划分别比去年扩大一倍到两倍。因此，各地党委在春节前后，就大抓育苗的准备工作，全面推广了简单易行的各种育苗法，并且通过召开现场会、办训练班等办法，培训了大批的育苗能手，普及各种育苗技术。
    各地春甘薯的育苗工作开始得更早。现在全省各地人民公社已建起温床五十万个和十一万多个火炕、土温室。早育的甘薯苗都已萌芽，长得又齐又旺。
    今年全省棉花种植任务也很大。根据各地经验，早播的棉花比夏种的棉花一般可增产20％至30％。各地为了解决茬口的矛盾，普遍推行了既能提早育苗、适时早播，又能保证壮苗的方块育苗法和营养钵育苗法。
    据新华社天津12日电　河北产棉区广大干部和社员，正在大抓棉花播种准备工作；并以建立棉花丰产方带动各项棉花播种准备工作做得又快又好。目前，很多产棉公社正在一面加紧棉田春灌消灭春旱，一面积极建立温室，为一部分计划育苗移栽的棉田培育棉苗。邯郸专区内丘县已经育苗一亿五千五百多万株，为棉花早生长早座桃早吐絮，争取棉田丰收创造了条件。
    大搞丰产方运动，有力地推动了各地的棉花播种准备工作。到2月下旬，全省73％以上的棉田都进行了深翻，深翻面积超过去年三倍；施上底肥的面积也比去年同期大大增加，一般每亩施肥量都达到七千斤左右，高额丰产田达到万斤以上。由于去冬今春大搞水利建设，全省已有70％的棉田有了水利设施，能够浇水的棉田比去年扩大33％。
