    以新的生产成就迎接自己的节日
    蒙古生产战线妇女劳动热情高涨
    新华社乌兰巴托电　据蒙古通讯社报道，蒙古人民共和国广大妇女在最近一个时期正以更大的热情积极地劳动着，力争以新的劳动成就庆祝自己的盛大节日——国际妇女节五十周年。
    哈特希耳出口基地的一个车间的女工组织了一个具有高度生产能力的突击队，名为“三八节五十周年突击队”。这个妇女突击队队员分别完成了今年1月份生产计划的百分之一百六十至二百，而2月份头两个星期中，她们已经完成了两周计划的百分之一百五十一至二百一十九。
    乔巴山省妇女委员会，为了庆祝国际妇女节五十周年而在全省妇女中进行着巨大的群众性的文化和政治教育工作。妇女委员会把自己的活动同解决现在正在国内进行的“向文化进军”运动的基本任务密切联系在一起。为了使妇女的普及教育提高一步，妇女委员会正在不断组织妇女到初级和中级夜校中去学习。在乔巴山省省会和各地方，一共建立了十个业余文化团体。参加这些团体活动的有二千多名劳动妇女。
