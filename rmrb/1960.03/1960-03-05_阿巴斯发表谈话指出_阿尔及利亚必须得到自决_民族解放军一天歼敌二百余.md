Xinhua News Agency, Tunis. A statement was issued by Abbas, Premier of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on February 29th, accusing the French government of refusing to hold negotiations on the conditions and guarantees for Algeria to exercise self-determination.

Abbas referred to the declaration made by French President de Gaulle on September 16, 1959, regarding the recognition of Algeria's right to self-determination. However, he pointed out that the French government has so far refused to negotiate the conditions and guarantees for Algeria to exercise self-determination, and has not provided any guarantees in this regard.

Abbas said, "On September 28th, we agreed to solve the problem through self-determination. We also emphasized that in order for this method to have a sincere and indispensable honest nature, it is necessary to discuss it." He said, "To do this, we demanded immediate negotiations on the conditions and guarantees for the implementation of self-determination. Because principle is one thing, and implementing the principle is another."

Abbas emphasized that there is no question of negotiating Algeria's future. The future of Algeria will be decided by the Algerian people themselves according to their own wishes.

In his statement, Abbas expressed his opposition to the French government's decision to hold "local elections" in Algeria this May and its conspiracy to split Algeria's territory. He said, "This kind of election and this threat to Balkanize our country, like all absurd methods, will only postpone negotiations indefinitely and delay the realization of peace."

Abbas pointed out that the riots launched by the extreme colonialists in Algeria in January had failed. "But it would be wrong to think that France and those in the army who advocate a military solution and their accomplices have been completely defeated." He pointed out, "The French government's decision to hold local elections in May is to reassure these colonialists."

Abbas said, "If self-determination is accepted without reservation, there is no reason to oppose negotiations on the guarantees necessary for the implementation of self-determination. To solve such an important problem, to enable our people to freely decide their own destiny, we say that holding such negotiations is inevitable."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 3rd. A military communique issued today by the Supreme Command of the Algerian National Liberation Army stated that on February 27th, the Algerian National Liberation Army killed 177 French soldiers, wounded 67, and captured 5 French soldiers.

The communique stated that Algerian nationalists also shot down three French military aircraft with anti-aircraft artillery, destroyed fourteen French military vehicles, damaged a French military train, and seized eighty-eight enemy weapons.

The communique said that the Algerian National Liberation Army had attacked six French military positions, engaged in six encounters with the enemy, and ambushed French convoys multiple times. At the same time, commandos of the Algerian National Liberation Army also attacked French military and police outposts and gathering places for French officers and soldiers in thirteen villages and towns.

    阿巴斯发表谈话指出
    阿尔及利亚必须得到自决
    民族解放军一天歼敌二百余
    据新华社突尼斯电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯于2月29日发表声明，指责法国政府拒绝就阿尔及利亚实行自决的条件和保证问题举行谈判。
    阿巴斯谈到法国总统戴高乐在1959年9月16日发表的关于承认阿尔及利亚自决权的声明。但是，他指出，法国政府到现在为止却一直拒绝就阿尔及利亚实行自决的条件和保证举行谈判，并且没有提供任何这方面的保证。
    阿巴斯说，“9月28日，我们同意用自决的办法解决问题。我们还强调指出，为了使这一办法具有真诚和必不可少的诚实的性质，有必要对它进行讨论。”他说，“为了这样做，我们要求立即谈判实行自决的条件和保证。因为原则是一回事，实行原则又是一回事。”
    阿巴斯强调指出，根本不存在就阿尔及利亚的前途举行谈判的问题。阿尔及利亚的前途将由阿尔及利亚人民按照他们的意愿由他们自己决定。
    阿巴斯在声明中表示反对法国政府关于今年5月在阿尔及利亚举行“地方选举”的决定和企图分裂阿尔及利亚的领土的阴谋。他说，“这种选举和这种妄图使我国巴尔干化的威胁，将像一切荒谬的办法一样，只会使谈判无期和拖延和平的实现。”
    阿巴斯指出，法国在阿尔及利亚的极端殖民主义分子在1月间发动的暴乱是失败了。“但是若认为法国和陆军中鼓吹武力解决的人及其同谍者已经完全被挫败，那便错了”。他指出，“法国政府决定在5月间举行地方选举，是为了让这些殖民主义分子感到放心”。
    阿巴斯说，“如果没有保留地接受自决，就没有理由反对谈判为实行自决所必需的保证。要解决这样重要的一个问题，要使我国人民能够自由地决定自己的命运，我们说，举行这种谈判是必不可免的。”
    新华社开罗3日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放军最高司令部今天发表的军事公报说，在2月27日这一天，阿尔及利亚民族解放军共打死法军一百七十七人，打伤六十七人，俘掳五名法国兵。
    公报说，阿尔及利亚民族主义者还用高射炮击落法国军用飞机三架，击毁十四辆法国军用车辆，炸坏一列法国军用火车，缴获敌人八十八件武器。
    公报说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军曾经袭击了六个法国军事阵地，同敌人进行六次遭遇战，并对法军车队进行多次伏击。和这同时，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的突击队还在十三个村镇袭击了法国军事和警察岗哨以及法国官兵的聚会地点。
