Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 11th. The Hong Kong British authorities recently implemented a measure to increase taxes, sparking widespread dissatisfaction among the vast majority of Hong Kong residents.

The Hong Kong British "Legislative Council" passed a bill on February 24, deciding to increase taxes on gasoline and cigarettes, and to increase charges for potable water. Gasoline tax was increased by 50%, cigarette tax by about 10%, and water charges for ordinary users increased by 25%, while construction and ship water usage increased by 50%. This tax increase decision was implemented immediately after the bill was passed.

The leaders of social organizations such as the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, the Kowloon Chamber of Commerce, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, as well as the heads of various industry associations most affected by the tax increase, such as the laundry, rubber, catering, textile, automobile, and barber industries, have successively published statements in newspapers in recent days. They unanimously pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' increase in tax rates, especially the increase in water charges, is unreasonable. This not only makes the burden on residents increasingly heavy, but also directly increases the difficulties for industry and commerce. Many Hong Kong newspapers have also published commentaries, pointing out that the tax increase measures are a heavy burden on residents.

Since the Hong Kong British authorities implemented the tax increase, it has already caused some price increases. The prices of gasoline, cigarettes, and paint oil rose on the same day the tax increase bill was passed. At present, industries such as laundry and automobiles, which are more affected by the tax increase, are also brewing to increase charges. In this way, the living burden of Hong Kong residents is becoming increasingly heavy.

    香港英国当局无理增加税收
    居民负担沉重群起反对
    新华社香港11日电　香港英国当局最近实施了一项增加税收的措施，引起香港广大居民的普遍不满。
    香港英国“立法局”在2月24日通过了一项法案，决定增加汽油、香烟税和增加食用水收费。汽油税增加50％，香烟税增加10％左右，水费普通用户增加25％、建筑及船舶用水增加50％，这项加税决定已在法案通过后立即实行。
    香港中华总商会、香港中华厂商联合会、九龙总商会、港九工会联合会等社会团体的负责人，以及受加税影响最大的洗染业、橡胶业、饮食业、纺织业、汽车业和理发业等各行业商会的负责人，连日来纷纷在报纸上发表谈话，一致指出香港英国当局增加税率，特别是增加水费，是不合理的，这不但使居民的负担越来越重，也直接使工商业增加了困难。香港许多报纸也纷纷发表评论，指出加税措施是对居民的一项沉重负担。
    香港英国当局实行加税后，已经引起部分物价的上涨。汽油、香烟、漆油的价格，在加税法案通过的当天就上涨了。目前，受加税影响较大的洗染、汽车等行业，也正酝酿增加收费。这样，香港居民的生活负担正在越来越加沉重。
