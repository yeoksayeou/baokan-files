Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 7th. Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, gave an interview to "People's Freedom" reporters on the social status and current tasks of Hungarian women.

In the interview, Kadar said that one of the greatest historical achievements in the fifteen years since the liberation of Hungary is the realization of equal rights for women. The people's democratic system has brought a happy and joyful new life to Hungarian women.

He said that only the complete and final victory of the socialist system can truly solve the social problems of women and working women. Today, socialist countries are effectively equipped with the political, economic, and cultural conditions to truly protect women's equal rights, lives, and the possibility of them exerting their specialties and talents in various fields.

Kadar said that the number of women in Hungary working in various sectors of the national economy in the last ten years is four times that of the twenty-five years before liberation. Today, there are 1.5 million women with paid incomes. Women account for 24% of the national university teachers and more than 10% of the judges. The number of female college students has doubled compared to the past. With the development of socialist construction, the role of women in politics, economy, and culture will be further strengthened.

Kadar emphasized that the Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) will provide greater possibilities for the creative labor and study of Hungarian women. We will continue to help develop public canteens and realize the mechanization of housework to reduce women's "second shift labor." He also emphasized that many factories and agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary are consciously using social forces to solve public canteens, build nurseries and kindergartens, and other examples that are worth promoting. Kadar pointed out that the current task of Hungarian women is to accelerate socialist construction together with the people of the whole country, actively participate in production labor and social activities, and constantly improve their cultural and technical level.

    卡达尔谈匈牙利妇女的当前任务
    妇女应积极参加生产和社会活动
    继续发展公共食堂，实现家务劳动的机械化，建筑托儿所  和幼儿园，以减轻妇女的“第二班劳动”
    新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔就匈牙利妇女的社会地位和当前任务向“人民自由报”记者发表了谈话。
    卡达尔在谈话中说，匈牙利解放十五年来取得的最大的历史成就之一，就是妇女实现了平等权利。人民民主制度给匈牙利妇女带来了幸福愉快的新生活。
    他说，只有社会主义制度取得彻底的和最后的胜利，才能够真正地解决妇女的社会问题和劳动妇女的问题。今天在社会主义国家中已经切实具备了政治、经济和文化条件，来真正保护妇女的平等权利、生活和她们在各个领域中发挥自己特长及才能的可能性。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利最近十年中参加国民经济各部门工作的妇女人数相当于解放前二十五年的四倍。今天有薪金收入的妇女达一百五十万人。全国大学教师中有24％是妇女，审判员中有10％以上是妇女。在高等学校学习的女大学生人数比过去增加了二倍。随着社会主义建设的发展，妇女在政治、经济和文化方面的作用将会进一步加强。
    卡达尔着重说，第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）将为匈牙利妇女创造性的劳动和学习提供更大的可能性。我们将继续帮助发展公共食堂，实现家务劳动的机械化，以便减轻妇女的“第二班劳动”。他还强调说，匈牙利各地不少工厂和农业生产合作社自觉地用社会力量来解决公共食堂、建筑托儿所和幼儿园等都是值得提倡的范例。卡达尔指出，目前匈牙利妇女的任务是同全国人民一起加速社会主义建设，积极参加生产劳动和社会活动，不断提高自己的文化技术水平。
