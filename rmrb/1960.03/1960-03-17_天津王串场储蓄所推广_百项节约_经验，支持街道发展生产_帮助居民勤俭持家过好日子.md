The Tianjin Wangchuanchang Bank Savings Office, under the leadership of the Party committee, actively participates in organizing the people's economic life, serving the central task well and achieving great development in savings work. Currently, more than 80% of the households in the Wangchuanchang Workers' New Village participate in savings.

Located in the Workers' New Village, a residential area for working people, the office's thirty employees regularly visit residents' homes to promote the benefits of thrift and savings. At the same time, they actively help residents manage their lives carefully, enabling them to eat well and save, dress well and save, and use things well and save. Under the leadership of the street Party committee and with the assistance of the Women's Federation and street activists, they have helped residents summarize more than 120 methods for saving grain, coal, oil, cloth, water, electricity, and extending the lifespan of daily necessities. The masses commonly refer to it as the "Hundred Savings" experience. The savings office employees also compiled these experiences into a booklet and mobilized social forces such as literacy teachers to widely publicize and impart them to residents through various forms, including oral presentations, drawings, peep shows, object exhibitions, and live demonstrations. This enabled the "Hundred Savings" experience to spread rapidly, further establishing a new atmosphere of thrift, savings, and support for national construction among the residents. In the Pioneer Production Cooperative, more than 800 households saved more than 20,000 jin of coal, 530 jin of grain, and over 400 chi of cloth in one month, while still eating, dressing, and using things well. With reduced expenses, savings deposits also increased, with term deposits increasing by more than 1,000 yuan in one month.

The employees of the Wangchuanchang Savings Office recognize that to guide mass consumption effectively, they must also help residents comprehensively arrange their lives. Building upon the "Hundred Savings," they adopted three methods: First, helping residents make plans for their living expenses; second, establishing different types of model households for thrift; and third, guiding residents' seasonal expenses, specifically helping the masses arrange their lives and plan consumption. The savings office also adopted a "matching" approach to help residents with various circumstances arrange their lives. They selected 35 typical households of different types from the thrifty households, including those with low income and heavy burdens who lived well, and those with high income who lived poorly. They publicized their expenses and methods of thrifty living among the masses. Each household had a role model to learn from and found methods for arranging their lives. For seasonal and holiday expenses, they helped each household make early arrangements and participate in savings, based on the spirit of being both enjoyable and economical and conforming to the masses' living habits, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. A prevailing atmosphere of thrift and careful management of life flourished in the Workers' New Village. More than 300 experts in thrift emerged among the residents, 61 of whom were named provincial, municipal, and district-level production and thrift pacesetters.

The employees of the Wangchuanchang Savings Office also actively organized the masses to participate in production and helped them increase their income in conjunction with their business work. Under the leadership and support of the street Party committee, the savings office assisted the street in organizing 15 types of production. The total income of the street masses increased by more than 18,000 yuan per month, which greatly expanded savings resources.

After the savings office understood the details of organizing production, it made full use of the bank's advantage of broad connections, actively linking up the street production cooperatives and industrial production departments, and engaging in the work of organizing production from various aspects. When there were production opportunities but a lack of labor, they conducted propaganda and education among the residents on the glory of labor, and organized idle labor to participate in production. When there were insufficient production tasks, they helped find production opportunities. When equipment was incomplete or raw materials were insufficient, they helped solve the problems of equipment and raw materials. When there was no technology, they helped find and train technical personnel. The savings office helped the Yangjing, Kangning, and Liming production cooperatives and the Eighth Garment Factory sign long-term contracts for processing work clothes, which brought production onto the right track. The income of the cooperative members increased, and savings deposits also increased from more than 800 yuan per month in the past to more than 1,900 yuan.

The savings office also incorporated the street savings agency business into the street's comprehensive service station, facilitating residents' deposit and withdrawal of funds. (Attached picture)

    天津王串场储蓄所推广“百项节约”经验，支持街道发展生产
    帮助居民勤俭持家过好日子
    本报讯　天津市王串场银行储蓄所在党委领导下，积极参加组织人民经济生活，既作到了很好地为中心工作服务，又使储蓄工作获得很大发展。目前，王串场工人新村居民80％以上的户都参加了储蓄。
    这个储蓄所设在劳动人民集居的工人新村，全所三十名职工，经常深入到居民家中，宣传勤俭持家，节约储蓄的好处；同时，积极帮助居民精打细算过日子，让居民吃好、吃省，穿好、穿省，用好、用省。他们在街党委的领导和妇联、街道积极分子的协助下，先后帮助居民总结出一百二十多项节约粮食、煤炭、油、布、水电和延长日用品使用寿命的方法。群众习惯称它为“百项节约”经验。储蓄所职工还把这些经验集印成册，并发动扫盲教师等社会力量，采取口头宣传、绘制图画、拉洋片、实物展览、现场表演等多种多样形式，在居民中广泛宣传、传授，使“百项节约”经验迅速传播开来，在广大居民群众中，进一步树立起勤俭持家、节约储蓄、支持国家建设的新风气。先锋生产社八百多户居民，在吃好、穿好、用好的前提下，一个月就节约了煤两万多斤，粮食五百三十斤，布四百多尺。开支节省了，储蓄存款也就更多了，一个月中，他们的定期储蓄增加了一千多元。
    王串场储蓄所职工，认识到要指导好群众消费，还必须帮助居民全面安排生活。他们在“百项节约”的基础上，采取了三种办法：一、帮助居民作生活开支计划；二、树立勤俭持家不同类型的标兵户；三、指导居民季节性的开支，具体地帮助群众安排生活，计划消费。储蓄所还采取了“对号入座”的办法，帮助各种不同情况的居民安排生活。他们从勤俭持家户中选出三十五个不同类型的典型户，既有收入少负担大、日子过得好的典型，又有收入多、富日子穷过的典型，将他们的开支情况和节俭过日子的方法，拿到群众中去宣传，家家户户有了学习的榜样，找到了安排生活的方法。对于季节性和过年过节的开支，他们本着既愉快，又节约，符合群众生活习惯的精神，帮助各户早作安排，参加储蓄，受到群众热烈欢迎。勤俭持家、精打细算过日子的风气在工人新村中大盛，全村居民中涌现出了三百多名勤俭持家能手，其中有六十一名被评为省、市、区级生产和勤俭持家红旗手。
    王串场储蓄所职工还结合业务工作积极组织群众参加生产、帮助群众增加收入。在街党委的领导和支持下，储蓄所协助街道上组织起十五种生产。全街群众总收入每月增加了一万八千多元，从而大大增辟了储蓄资源。
    储蓄所摸清了组织生产的底以后，就充分发挥银行联系面广的有利条件，积极为街道生产社和工业生产部门联系挂钩、“穿针引线”，从多方面展开了组织生产的工作。有生产门路缺乏劳动力，就向居民进行劳动光荣的宣传教育，组织闲散劳动力参加生产。生产任务不足，就帮助寻找生产门路。设备不全，原料不足，就帮助解决设备、原料。没有技术，就帮助寻找和培养技术人材。储蓄所帮助洋井、康宁、黎明等生产社和第八缝纫厂签订了加工工作服的长期合同，使生产纳入了正轨，社员的收入增加了，储蓄存款也由过去每月八百多元，上升到一千九百多元。
    这个储蓄所还把街道储蓄代办业务纳入了街道的综合服务站，便利了居民存取款项。（附图片）
