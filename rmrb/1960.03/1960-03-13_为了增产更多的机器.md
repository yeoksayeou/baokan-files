    To Produce More Machines
     Commentator of this newspaper
    The current situation on the mechanical industry front is excellent. A new high tide of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, is spreading like wildfire, powerfully promoting the steady rise of mechanical production. By the end of February, the national mechanical industry had completed more than 80% of its output value target for the first quarter, and the average daily output value had greatly exceeded the level of December last year. Among the 27 major products, most have completed more than 75% of the quarterly production plan, and some have even exceeded the planned quarterly output. In the trial manufacture of new products, the execution of contract tasks, and especially the balance of production, there has been an exciting good situation rarely seen in previous years.
    The good completion of the production plans in January and February has encouraged everyone's confidence in completing future tasks. However, as far as the whole year is concerned, this is only the beginning. Taking this step, we must see the next step. We must grasp it more tightly, strive to comprehensively and overfulfill the production tasks for the first quarter, and prepare for a greater leap forward in the second quarter.
    The mechanical industry is an important foundation for realizing the technical transformation of the national economy. The great leap forward in all walks of life has put higher and higher demands on the mechanical industry. The current upsurge of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization throughout the country has made this demand even more urgent and widespread. Whether it is industry, agriculture, or transportation, all require the mechanical industry to provide more equipment as soon as possible. Even within the mechanical industry, there are many weak links in various industries that also need to be supplemented with equipment as soon as possible. Mechanical workers across the country must see this situation clearly, consciously undertake this glorious task, and grasp the current work more tightly.
    For the current production and for preparing for the future, the mechanical industry must first focus on completing contract tasks and strive to deliver goods ahead of schedule according to the contract. The contract embodies the needs of the production and construction of various departments of the national economy. The timely and early completion of contract tasks is of great significance to the comprehensive completion of the enterprise's production plan and to supporting national construction. Therefore, the contract tasks for the first quarter must be completed as soon as possible, and the production arrangements for the second quarter must meet the requirements of the contract.
    Secondly, the early and overfulfillment of production tasks will inevitably increase the tasks of material work. In addition to doing everything possible to solve the raw materials needed for current production, all localities must make full preparations for the materials used in the next quarter's production and put them into production in a timely manner. On the one hand, it is necessary to seize the work of ordering goods (including urging and transporting) and open up supplementary sources of goods (such as using new materials, self-reliance, and mutual adjustment, etc.). On the other hand, it is necessary to seize material savings, especially to list saving materials from improving product design and innovating technology as an important task of the enterprise's technical work, and strive to produce more products on the basis of savings.
    Third, mechanical products include extremely complex cooperation and supporting work from production to delivery, and any negligence will affect the timely completion of the task. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the cooperation and supporting work. It must be grasped to the end and checked regularly. It is necessary to take care of the present and the future; it is necessary to grasp both quantity and quality. In particular, give full play to the spirit of communist cooperation and establish
  the style of "giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself."
    Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the production scheduling work at all levels. The rapid development of production will inevitably lead to new imbalances in equipment capacity, material supply, and technical strength. Strong and effective production scheduling work is needed to adapt to this situation. At present, it is particularly necessary to strengthen material scheduling work and create more ways to improve its efficiency. The material adjustment meetings and cooperation meetings held in Shanghai and other places adopt the method of mass movement and are more communist in style, which has a very good effect. This experience is worth promoting.
    This year's mechanical industry task is very heavy. To complete these tasks, the most fundamental thing is to further mobilize the masses under the leadership of the Party and vigorously engage in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. Only on the basis of the mass movement can the work be truly grasped tightly, and all measures can be truly implemented.

    为了增产更多的机器
     本报评论员
    当前机械工业战线的形势很好。以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮，如火燎原，有力地推动着机械生产节节上升。到2月底止，全国机械工业第一季度的产值任务已经完成了80％以上，平均日产值也大大地超过了去年12月份的水平，二十七种主要产品中，大部分已经完成了季度产量计划的75％以上，有的并已超过了季度计划产量。在新产品的试制、合同任务的执行，尤其是生产的均衡性等方面，都呈现了往年很少有的令人兴奋的好局面。
    1、2月的生产计划完成得好，鼓舞了大家完成今后任务的信心。但是，就全年说来，这还只是一个开始。走这一步，就要看到下一步，我们必须抓得更紧，力争全面超额地完成第一季度的生产任务，并为第二季度更大的跃进作好生产准备。
    机械工业是实现国民经济技术改造的重要基础。各行各业的大跃进，向机械工业提出了越来越高的要求，当前席卷全国的以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动的高潮，使这种要求变得更为急迫和广泛。无论工业、农业、交通运输、都要求机械工业尽快地给提供更多的装备。就是机械工业内部各个行业里，也有很多薄弱环节，同样地需要尽快地补充装备。全国机械职工要看准这个形势，自觉地把这个光荣的任务承担起来，把当前的工作抓得更紧。
    为了当前生产，又为了准备今后，机械工业首先要抓完成合同任务，力争提前按合同交货。合同体现了国民经济各部门生产建设的需要。合同任务的及时和提前完成，对于企业生产计划的全面完成，对于支援国家建设，都有重大的意义。因之，第一季度的合同任务要抓紧完成，第二季度的生产安排要符合合同的要求。
    其次，生产任务的提前和超额完成，必然加重材料工作的任务。各地除要千方百计地解决当前生产中需要的原料、材料外，更要对下一季度的生产用料作好充分的准备，并及时投入生产。一方面要抓紧订货工作（包括催、运），开辟补充货源（如采用新材料、自力更生及互相调剂等）。另一方面要抓紧材料节约，特别是把从改进产品设计、革新工艺中节约材料，列为企业技术工作的重要任务，力争在节约的基础上增产更多的产品。
    第三，机械产品从生产到交货都包括着极为复杂的协作关系和配套工作，任何一点疏忽都会影响任务的及时完成。因之，必须抓紧协作和配套工作。要一直抓到底，并经常检查。既要顾当前，又要顾今后；既要抓数量，又要抓质量。特别是充分发挥共产主义大协作的精神，树立
  “把方便让与别人，把困难留给自己”的风气。
    第四，要加强各级的生产调度工作。生产的飞跃发展，必然经常在设备能力、物资供应、技术力量各方面出现新的不平衡，要有强有力的生产调度工作，才能适应这种情况。目前特别需要加强材料调度工作，创造更多的方式来提高它的效率。在上海等地召开的材料调剂会议和协作会议，采用群众运动的方法，大比共产主义风格，效果很好，这种经验值得推广。
    今年机械工业任务很重。要完成这些任务，最根本的一条是要在党的领导下，进一步地发动群众，大搞以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。只有在群众运动的基础上，工作才能真正地抓得紧，一切措施也才能真正贯彻。
