    Destroying the Large Estate System, Establishing Cooperative Organizations
    Cuban Farmers Begin a New Life
    To strive for economic independence and develop agricultural production, the Cuban people are steadfastly carrying out land reform. In many areas, the large estate system has been destroyed, farmers have been allocated land, cooperatives have been established, and a new life has begun.

    A Symbol of a Happy Life
    The Sixteenth District of Las Villas Province is a relatively developed agricultural area. Several cooperatives have been established in this district, including the Belerrejo Tomato Cooperative, composed of 1,000 farmer households, the Federico Cadwevilla Tobacco Cooperative, composed of 134 farmer households, and the Banao Scallion Cooperative, composed of 37 farmer households.

    An agricultural and pastoral cooperative composed of 81 farmer households owns a total of 35 caballerias (approximately 201.45 Chinese mu per caballeria) of fertile land. Among them, 5 caballerias of land are planted with rice, 1 caballeria of land is planted with bananas, 2 caballerias of land are planted with tomatoes, 1 caballeria of land is planted with peppers and cassava, and another caballeria of land is planted with pumpkins. On the remaining 25 caballerias of land, a dairy farm has been established. Cooperative members can obtain milk for their own consumption from the farm. The 150 children in the cooperative can eat milk brought by their parents from the dairy farm every morning.

    While organizing cooperatives, people's stores have also been established in this district. In the people's store of the agricultural and pastoral cooperative, 81 cooperative members can buy grain and food at reasonable prices.

    Cooperatives and people's stores have become a symbol of a happy life in this area.

    Inheriting the Fighting Spirit of Martyrs
    In the White Lake area of Bayamo City, a cooperative named "Vicente Guasata" was recently established. This was originally an estate with 44 caballerias of land. Although the estate had fertile land and was close to the city, it had been barren in the past and became a habitat for wild storks.

    Now, this estate has been handed over to 38 farmer households. Two of them already live in comfortable houses built by the National Land Reform Commission, and housing for other farmers is also under construction. In addition, a primary school dormitory and a clinic have also been built.

    The farmers of the cooperative understand that they should create a better life with their own labor. They are determined to make full use of the land. At present, four caballerias of land have been sown.

    The members of the cooperative proudly named the cooperative "Vicente Guasata," because Guasata was a local revolutionary martyr who heroically sacrificed himself in the struggle against tyranny. The members are determined to inherit the fighting spirit of the revolutionary martyrs. They are extremely angry at the intervention activities of U.S. imperialism and are vigilantly preparing to defend their hometown and motherland with heroic struggle. (Attached picture)

    摧毁大庄园制度　建立合作社组织
    古巴农民开始了新的生活
    古巴人民为了争取经济独立，发展农业生产，正在坚定地进行土地改革。在很多地区，大庄园制度被摧毁了，农民们分得了土地，建立了合作社，开始了新的生活。
    幸福生活的象征
    拉斯维利亚斯省的十六区，是农业比较发达的一个地区。在这个区里，已经成立了好几个合作社。其中包括：由一千户农民组成的贝拉列霍西红柿合作社，由一百三十四户农民组成的费德里科·卡德维利亚烟草合作社和由三十七户农民组成的巴拿奥大葱合作社。
    一个由八十一户农民组成的农牧合作社，一共拥有三十五卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚约合二百零一点四五中国亩）的肥沃的土地。其中有五卡瓦耶里亚的土地种稻米，一卡瓦耶里亚的土地种香蕉，二卡瓦耶里亚的土地种西红柿，一卡瓦耶里亚的土地种辣椒和木薯，另一卡瓦耶里亚的土地种南瓜。在其余的二十五卡瓦耶里亚的土地上，建立了一个奶牛场。合作社员可以从场里得到自己食用的牛奶。合作社里的一百五十个儿童每天早晨可以吃到他们父母从奶牛场带来的牛奶。
    在组织合作社的同时，这个区也建立了人民商店。在农牧合作社的人民商店里，八十一户社员可以用合理的价格买到粮食和食物。
    合作社和人民商店，已经成为这一地区幸福生活的象征。
    继承烈士的战斗精神
    在巴亚莫城的白湖区，最近成立了一个以“维森特·盖萨塔”命名的合作社。这里原来是一个拥有四十四卡瓦耶里亚土地的庄园。这个庄园虽然土地肥沃，并且靠近城市，然而过去一直荒芜着，成为野鹳的栖息地。
    现在，这个庄园交给了三十八户农民。其中两户已经住在全国土改委员会建筑的舒适的房子里，别的农户的住房也正在建造中。此外，还建造了一所小学生宿舍和一个医务所。
    合作社的农民懂得，应该用自己的劳动来创造更好的生活。他们决心充分利用土地。目前，有四卡瓦耶里亚的土地已经播种了。
    合作社的社员们自豪地用“维森特·盖萨塔”为合作社的命名，因为盖萨特是当地的一位在反暴政斗争中英勇牺牲的革命烈士。社员们决心继承革命烈士的战斗精神。他们对美帝国主义的干涉活动感到无比愤怒，正在警惕地准备着用英勇的战斗来保卫家乡和祖国。（附图片）
