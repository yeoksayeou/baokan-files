Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: Relevant central departments are vigorously transferring and supplying various building materials and means of production needed to settle returned overseas Chinese.

　　In order to settle returned overseas Chinese, many state-owned overseas Chinese farms need to build a large number of dormitories, and many places need to build or expand supplementary schools and secondary technical schools for returned overseas Chinese students. The relevant central departments have allocated all the cement, linoleum, glass and other materials needed for these construction projects. Some means of production, such as steel and machine tools used for production, which some state-owned overseas Chinese farms need when settling returned overseas Chinese, have also been arranged by relevant central departments for factories in various places to produce and supply.

　　The central departments concerned attach great importance to the supply of materials needed for the resettlement of returned overseas Chinese. The State Planning Commission and the Economic Commission have held special meetings for this purpose. The Ministry of Construction Engineering has decided to give priority to the allocation and supply of building materials needed for the resettlement of returned overseas Chinese. The Shanghai Waterproof Materials Factory under the Ministry quickly delivered all the materials within three days after receiving the notice to allocate a large number of linoleum. The freight department of the Ministry of Railways has listed the timely transportation of various materials needed for the resettlement of returned overseas Chinese as an important task at present.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th Dispatch: The majority of overseas Chinese who returned to Guangzhou from Indonesia since January this year have been properly settled and have happily embarked on their work or studies.

　　Since January this year, four batches of overseas Chinese, totaling more than 3,000 people, have returned to Guangzhou via Shenzhen. Most of these returned overseas Chinese are from Indonesia. Apart from a small number of people who voluntarily returned to their hometowns and were employed by the local people's communes, the majority were assisted by relevant departments in finding employment or education. At present, except for the 1,200 returned overseas Chinese who returned to China on the 25th and are currently undergoing registration procedures for employment and education, the majority of the returned overseas Chinese who returned before this have been properly settled. According to statistics from relevant departments, more than 270 people have been settled in state-owned overseas Chinese farms or state-owned farms in Guangdong Province, more than 490 people have been settled in supplementary schools for overseas Chinese students in Beijing, Jimei, Guangzhou and other places, more than 280 people have been assisted by the government to return to their original homes in Fujian, Guangxi and other places for employment, and a number of overseas Chinese technicians have been assigned to work in industrial, mining, and enterprise.

　　More than 40 returned overseas Chinese, including Li Minghua, Yu Deli, and Zhong Zhaogan, returned to Guangzhou from Indonesia in January this year and were assigned to the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island to participate in production. The farm arranged for them to work in the farm's comprehensive factory, citronella processing factory and other departments according to their respective specialties.

　　More than 200 returned overseas Chinese who returned to Guangzhou on February 18 have been assigned to the Yingde State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm in Guangdong to participate in production. When they arrived at the farm, the old farm members held a grand welcome meeting for them. Some returned overseas Chinese were so moved that they burst into tears. The returned overseas Chinese Zhuang Lianping said to the reception staff: "The motherland's government and people are closer than our own mothers."

　　Overseas Chinese technicians who returned from Indonesia this year have been assigned to work in industrial and mining enterprises in Guangdong Province. After taking up their posts, they all expressed that they would actively produce in their new posts to repay the care of the motherland and the people. The returned overseas Chinese Cai Mingjin was assigned to work in the first workshop of the Overseas Chinese Sewing Machine Factory. On his first day at work, the veteran workers took the initiative to guide him in his operation and carefully told him what he should pay attention to in production. At first, he could not understand Cantonese, so the workers taught him by gesturing. This enthusiastic help moved him very much. After he got off work on his first day, he went home and studied how to improve labor efficiency. On his first day at the factory, he only produced more than 200 oil pipe springs for sewing machines, but on the second day he produced more than 700 pieces, and on the fourth day he produced more than 990 pieces.

　　Nearly 200 returned overseas Chinese students who were assigned to the Guangzhou Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Secondary Remedial School have officially started their remedial classes on February 1. The returned overseas Chinese student Li Qunhua was in economic difficulty because her father's small business in Indonesia had closed down and her brother had recently become unemployed. After learning about her situation, the school not only provided her with meals, but also gave her cotton clothes and quilts. She said: "The motherland is just like my own mother. If I stayed in Indonesia, where would I have the opportunity to study?"

    中央有关部门大力供应华侨所需物品
    新近回广州的一批华侨得到妥善安置
    新华社29日讯　中央有关部门大力调拨、供应安置归国侨胞所需的各种建筑材料和生产资料。
    为了安置归国侨胞，许多国营华侨农场需要兴建大批宿舍，许多地方需要兴建或扩大归国华侨学生补习学校和中等技术学校。这些建筑工程所需要的大批水泥、油毡、玻璃等材料，中央有关部门已如数拨给。一些国营华侨农场在安置归侨时需要的部分生产资料，如生产用的钢材、机床等，也已由中央有关部门安排各地工厂生产和供应。
    中央各有关部门，十分重视安置归侨所需的物资供应工作。国家计划委员会、经济委员会曾为此专门召开了会议。建筑工程部决定优先调拨、供应安置归侨所需的建筑材料，这个部所属的上海防水材料厂，在接到调拨大批油毡的通知后，在三天内就迅速交齐了物资。铁道部货运部门把及时运送安置归侨所需的各种物资，列为当前的一项重要任务。
    据新华社广州28日电　今年1月以来从印度尼西亚回到广州的华侨，已经大部分得到妥善安置，愉快地走上工作或学习岗位。
    从今年1月份到现在，先后有四批华侨约三千多人，经深圳回到广州。这些归侨大部分是从印度尼西亚回来的。他们当中除了小部分人自愿回到自己的家乡，由当地人民公社安置就业外，大部分是由有关部门帮助安置就业或就学。目前，除了25日回国的一千二百名归侨，正在办理登记就业、就学手续外，在这以前回来的归国侨胞，大部分都已经得到妥善安置，据有关部门统计，安置在广东省国营华侨农场或国营农场的有二百七十多人，安置到北京、集美、广州等地华侨学生补习学校就学的有四百九十多人，由政府帮助回原籍福建、广西等地就业的有二百八十多人，另外还有一批华侨技术工人被安置到工矿、企业中工作。
    归侨黎明华、余德力、钟诏乾等四十多人，今年1月间从印度尼西亚回到广州后，被安置到海南岛兴隆华侨农场参加生产。农场按照他们各人的特长分别安排到农场的综合工厂、香茅加工厂等部门工作。
    2月18日回到广州的一批归侨，已有二百多人被安置到广东英德国营华侨农场参加生产。他们到达农场时，农场的老场员为他们举行了盛大的欢迎会。有些归侨因此感动得热泪盈眶。归侨庄联平对接待人员说：“祖国政府和人民比亲娘还亲。”
    今年从印度尼西亚回来的华侨技术工人，被分别安置到广东省的工矿企业中去工作。他们走上工作岗位后，都表示要在新的岗位上积极生产，报答祖国和人民的关怀。归侨蔡明进被分配到华侨缝纫机厂第一车间工作，头一天上班，老工人便主动指导他操作，细心地告诉他在生产中应该注意的事项。他最初听不懂广州话，工人们就用手比划着教他。这种热情帮助使他非常感动，他第一天下班后回到家里，就研究怎样提高劳动效率。他入厂第一天只造出二百多件缝纫机的油管弹簧，第二天就造出七百多件，到第四天造出了九百九十多件。
    被安置到广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校补习的近二百多个归国华侨学生，已经在2月1日正式开始补习功课。归侨学生李群华因为父亲在印度尼西亚经营的小生意停业了，哥哥也在最近失业，经济困难。学校知道她的情况后，除了供给她膳食外，还发给她棉衣棉被。她说：“祖国真像我的亲生娘，如果留在印度尼西亚，我哪里还有就学的机会。”
