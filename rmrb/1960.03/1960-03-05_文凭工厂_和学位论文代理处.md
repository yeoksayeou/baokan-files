So-Called Western "Civilization"

"Diploma Mills" and Thesis Agencies
    A booklet entitled "American Diploma Mills," recently published by the American Education Association, stated that at least 200 "diploma mills" are operating in 37 states in the United States. In the past year alone, 750,000 "students" have registered with these "factories," and their business is extremely profitable, with annual revenues as high as $75 million.

    These "diplomas" are not only sold domestically in the United States, but are also supplied to those who need them in 42 countries.

    At the same time, there are agencies in the United States that write exam papers and theses for college students and professors. According to the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," someone in New York spent $3,000 to have an agency write a doctoral dissertation. College students exchange semester exam papers for $50 or $350.

   “文凭工厂”和学位论文代理处
    不久前在美国教育协会出刊的一本题为“美国文凭工厂”的小册子中说，在美国的三十七个州里，至少有二百个“文凭工厂”在营业。仅仅在最近一年内，就有七十五万名“学生”向这些“工厂”登记注册，而它们的营业额也是利市百倍，一年收入竟高七千五百万美元之巨。
    这种“文凭”不但在美国国内销售，而且还供应四十二个国家的需求者。
    同时，在美国还有代大学生和教授作考卷和学位论文的代理处。据“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”揭露，纽约有人花三千元请代理处代写博士论文。学院的学生则以五十元或三百五十元换取学期考试的考卷。
