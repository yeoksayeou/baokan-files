　　Our Intimate Person

　　Speaking of Comrade Zhou Youren, Deputy Secretary of the High Temple People's Commune Party Committee, the masses praise him as "Our Intimate Person."

　　Once, Hanyang was hit by an exceptionally severe flood, the worst in a century. More than three thousand migrant workers and people engaged in flood fighting within the embankment were under serious threat. At that time, the Fifth District Party Committee sent Zhou Youren to Dengjiakou with an urgent letter, asking for boats to rescue the people inside the dike. Zhou Youren walked and ran to Tongjin, only to be blocked by a breach in the road. The breach was more than three zhang (about 10 meters) wide, with rapid currents, and pigs, chickens, and furniture floating down from upstream were swirling in the water. Should he try to cross? There were no boats around, and he wasn’t a good swimmer. He might lose his life if he went into the water. Should he take a detour? That would take time, and every minute and second of delay was related to the safety of thousands of people. What should he do? The safety of thousands of people was paramount. He had to find a way to swim across. Just then, a wooden axle from an ox cart floated down from upstream. Zhou Youren gritted his teeth, ran upstream for several zhang, jumped into the water, grabbed the axle, and, using all his strength, struggled to swim to the other side. Once he reached Dengjiakou, boats were dispatched. Comrade Zhou Youren thought: I should set an example and let the masses go first. He and seven teachers helped the masses move their belongings onto the boats. After the boats left, he and the teachers advanced along the dike, wading through the water, but were blocked by the flood and forced to climb to the top of a tree. This half-submerged tree looked so small in the vast expanse of water, and the menacing water snakes kept climbing onto the tree. Some people were afraid of being bitten by snakes, so Comrade Zhou Youren voluntarily sat on the lowest branch of the tree, using a stick to drive the snakes away. They sat there for two days and two nights, hungry and cold. Some people complained that they shouldn't have stayed behind, some were pessimistic and despondent, and some even wrote their names on their clothes, preparing for their bodies to be identified after death. However, Comrade Zhou Youren optimistically encouraged everyone, saying, "Comrades, the Party and the people will never forget us, and they will definitely send people to find us. Even if a few of us sacrifice ourselves to ensure the safety of thousands of people, what's so bad about that?" The district committee sent boats to find them, and after searching for two days, they finally found them in the tree.

### 我们的贴心人

    我们的贴心人
    提起高庙人民公社党委副书记周友仁同志，群众称道他是“我们的贴心人”。
    有一次，汉阳遭到了百年难遇的特大洪水的袭击。垸内三千多抢险的民工和群众，受到严重威胁。当时，五区区委派周友仁送急信到邓家口去，调船来抢救堤内的人。周友仁连走带跑地到了通津，又遇着缺口拦住了路。这缺口三丈多宽，水流急湍，上游漂来的猪、鸡和家具在水里只打旋旋。抢渡吧，左右无船，自己的水性又不熟，说不定一下水就会送掉性命。绕道走吧，要耽误时间，一分一秒钟的拖延都关系着几千人的安全。怎么办？几千人的安全要紧，无论如何也得想法游过去。正好上游又漂来一根牛车的木车轴，周友仁咬紧牙根，往上游抢行了几丈远，跳下水去，抓住车轴，顺着水势，用尽全身力气，到底挣扎着游到了对岸。一到邓家口，船只调来了。周友仁同志想：应该作榜样，让群众先走。他就和七个教师一起帮群众搬东西上了船。船走后，他和教师们沿堤涉水前进，结果被大水阻住，被迫爬上了树顶。水势不断上涨，这半截树在一片汪洋的大水中显得那么渺小，欺侮人的水蛇还不断地攀到树上来。有人怕蛇咬，周友仁同志就自动坐在树干最下一层用棍子赶蛇。这样又饿又冷地坐了两天两夜。有人抱怨先前不该留在后面，有的人悲观失望，甚至把姓名写在衣襟上，准备死后别人好认尸。周友仁同志却乐观地鼓励着大家说：“同志们，党和人民绝不会忘记我们，一定会派人找我们的。就算我们几个人牺牲了，换出了几千个人的安全，这又有什么不好呢？”区委派人出来找他们的船只，寻找两天终于从树上发现了他们。　　　　　（附图片）
