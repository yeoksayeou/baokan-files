Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: People's Liberation Army units are actively assisting local departments in carrying out militia construction work, resulting in a significant improvement in the political awareness and military skills of the vast numbers of militiamen.

The assistance given by various units to militia construction is conducted under the unified leadership of local Party committees at all levels, and in close coordination with people's armed forces departments and militia organizations at all levels. Based on the principle of "labor as the primary task, combining labor and military affairs," and tailored to the production circumstances and characteristics of militias in various regions, the units flexibly adopt forms such as mobile, decentralized, substitute training, and centralized training where conditions permit, vigorously assisting local militia organizations in carrying out military and political training. During the training process, cadres of the units and outstanding soldiers serving as militia instructors frequently go deep into the fields, construction sites, workshops, and training grounds, laboring, studying, and engaging in recreational activities alongside the vast numbers of militiamen, using production breaks to impart the advanced experience of the troops and guide the militiamen in operations. Responsible cadres of many units also regularly give political lessons to the local militia teams, conducting national defense education and education on the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army and the militia. The units also systematically train a group of militia instructors who can explain general military theory and perform practical operations, both solving the problem of instructors in militia training and enabling militia training to be further closely integrated with production and adapted to local conditions. Many units, based on local specific conditions, closely integrate militia training with the militias' production specialties and study specialties, achieving significant results.

With the vigorous assistance of the PLA units, the vast numbers of militiamen in various regions have consciously and widely launched military training activities. Through conscious and arduous study and training activities, the political awareness and military skills of the vast numbers of militiamen have been universally improved, and their organizational discipline has been significantly strengthened, thereby directly promoting the improvement of production efficiency and receiving enthusiastic praise from leaders at all levels and the broad masses of the people.

In the process of assisting militia construction, the units have also learned rich production knowledge and the fine work style of diligent labor and hard struggle from the militiamen on various fronts. In particular, the great enthusiasm and soaring drive of the vast numbers of militiamen in building socialism have greatly educated and encouraged the officers and soldiers of the units.
