Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: After enduring a severe 49-day ordeal and surviving the longest drift in human history, the four Soviet heroes, Tsyganshin, Fedotov, Kryuchkovsky, and Poplavsky, returned to Moscow on a Soviet "Tu-104" plane at 4 p.m. on the 29th, from Paris. These four Soviet soldiers were rescued by the American aircraft carrier "Kearsarge" in the Pacific Ocean, 1,000 nautical miles northwest of Midway Island. They arrived in France on the 28th after sailing from San Francisco on the 23rd of this month.

Today afternoon, a large crowd of welcomers gathered early at Vnukovo Airport, with representatives from Moscow's factories, organizations, and the military.

A mass rally attended by thousands of people was also held at the airport to welcome the four Soviet soldiers back home.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: Since the four young Soviet soldiers conquered the ocean, withstood the severe 49-day ordeal with dauntless spirit, and successfully returned to their homeland, working people throughout the Soviet Union have expressed their thoughts, feeling proud of the heroic deeds of these young Soviet people and that the Soviet people have such sons. The parents of soldier Fedotov said in a telegram to Comrade Khrushchev that their son and the other three comrades withstood this test, mainly because they were raised in the Soviet country, which is led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and marches from victory to victory.

In Turbovo, the hometown of soldier Kryuchkovsky, people are congratulating Kryuchkovsky's mother. The elderly Soviet woman said: The joy I felt after hearing this news is hard to express in words. I want to express my heartfelt, motherly gratitude to the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, because it was under its education that my son was able to overcome difficulties.

The famous Soviet writer Sholokhov said in a telegram to the editorial department of "Komsomolskaya Pravda": The Soviet Komsomol and the Soviet army are excellently cultivating young eagles.

Antonov, a young worker at the Vladimir Ilyich factory in Moscow, said that the reason why these four Soviet soldiers were able to conquer the ocean was because they were filled with love and loyalty to their great motherland.

The young people of the Kazakh Tishkulsky State Farm, who recently conquered the wilderness, said that in our work of developing the wilderness, we also had a great struggle with nature, but the difficulties we encountered were too small compared with theirs. The achievements of these four people encourage us to work better. We must learn from them and use greater perseverance and determination to fight nature and build our motherland into a better place. Leontiva, a student at the Moscow Institute of Chemical Technology, also expressed in her feelings that she would learn from their example, always remain steadfast in the struggle against difficulties, and always maintain revolutionary optimism for the cause of communism.

    四勇士英雄事绩鼓舞着苏联人民
    莫斯科集会欢迎祖国的英雄儿子归来
    据新华社莫斯科29日电　经受住四十九昼夜严重考验、度过了人类历史上最长一次漂流的苏联四勇士齐甘申、费多托夫、克留奇科夫斯基、波普拉夫斯基，29日下午四时乘苏联“图—104”飞机自巴黎回到莫斯科。这四位苏联士兵是在太平洋中途岛西北西一千海里处漂流时被美国航空母舰“歧沙治号”救起的。本月23日从旧金山乘轮船于28日到达法国。
    今天下午，在伏努科夫飞机场上很早就聚集起了众多的欢迎者，莫斯科各工厂、机关团体和军队都有代表前来欢迎。
    为欢迎这四位苏联士兵归来，在飞机场上还举行了有数千人参加的群众大会。
    据新华社莫斯科29日电　自从四位苏联青年士兵战胜海洋，以大无畏的精神经受住了四十九天严重考验，并且顺利返回祖国以后，苏联各地劳动人民纷纷发表感想，为苏联青年这一英勇事迹和苏联人民有这样的儿子而感到骄傲。士兵费多托夫的父亲和母亲在给赫鲁晓夫同志的电报中说，他们的儿子和其他三个同志经受住了这个考验，这主要是因为他们是在苏联共产党领导下由胜利走向胜利的苏维埃国家中教养长大的。
    在士兵克留奇科夫斯基的故乡图尔鲍沃，人们都在向克留奇科夫斯基的母亲祝贺。这位年老的苏联妇女说：我听到这个消息后的愉快心情是难以用言语表达的。我要向苏联列宁共产主义青年团表示衷心的、母亲的感谢，因为正是在它的教育下才使得我的儿子克服了困难。
    苏联著名作家萧洛霍夫在给“共青团真理报”编辑部的电文里说：苏联共青团和苏联军队卓越地培养着年青的雄鹰。
    莫斯科弗拉基米尔·伊里奇工厂青年工人安东诺夫说，这四个苏联士兵所以能够战胜海洋，是因为他们对伟大的祖国充满了热爱与忠诚。
    在不久前征服了荒地的哈萨克季什库利斯基国营农场的青年们说，我们在开发荒地的工作中，也曾与自然进行了巨大的斗争，但是我们遇到的困难同他们比起来真是太小了。他们四个人的功绩鼓舞着我们更好地工作，我们一定要向他们学习，并且用更大的毅力和决心来和自然斗争，把我们的祖国建设得更美好。莫斯科化工学院的学生列奥季娃在发表感想时也表示，要学习他们的榜样，在同困难斗争中一定永远坚定不移，对共产主义事业永远抱着革命的乐观主义。
