Baghdad "People's Solidarity" published the National Program of the Iraqi Communist Party on January 10. The following is a summary:

    The preface to the program states: "The Iraqi Communist Party is struggling to complete the tasks of our glorious revolution—the July 14 Revolution. Our party, in determining these tasks, bases itself on the revolutionary nature, the conditions of our country, and the characteristics of our society, and is guided by the principles of scientific socialism."

    The program continues: Iraq's revolution "has overthrown the reactionary semi-colonial and semi-feudal monarchical system, has taken significant steps in destroying the economic, legal, and ideological foundations of this system, and has established an independent (anti-imperialist) democratic (anti-feudal and anti-reactionary) republic on its ruins."

    The program emphasizes: "The July 14 Revolution, which is fundamentally aimed at freeing the people from imperialist control, feudal exploitation, and the tyranny of the old era, is also a 'people's revolution' involving millions of peasants, workers, and other masses. Under the historical conditions of the present era, due to the establishment and consolidation of the socialist camp, the increasing depth of progressive ideas, and the pioneering role played by the working class in social development, this revolution possesses a more distinct 'popular' nature and importance."

    The program states: "As a liberating democratic revolution, the main tasks of our revolution are: to eliminate the forces of imperialism and the remnants of its exploitation, to make the country's independence complete and strengthened, to eliminate feudalism and its remnants in the countryside, to distribute land to the peasants, to industrialize the country, to open up democratic freedoms for the people, and to raise the people's living standards, health, and cultural level." Undoubtedly, "the realization of these tasks is inseparable from defending the republic and consolidating its path of liberation and democracy." The program points out that these main tasks in the current historical stage of Iraq are liberating and democratic tasks that are not directed against capitalist-bourgeois production relations. "Therefore, the realization of these tasks is not for the benefit of one class but is in the interests of all the people's patriotic classes—workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie (laborers, handicraftsmen, professionals, small farmers, and intellectuals), and the middle bourgeoisie, i.e., the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national bourgeoisie (industrialists, merchants, farmers, contractors, and national capitalists)."

    The program continues, stating that determining the social forces of the revolution also requires considering the national structure of Iraqi society. Iraqi society is basically composed of two main nationalities—the Arab nationality and the Kurdish nationality—and some minority nationalities, with the Arab people constituting the majority of society. "This necessitates emphasizing the legitimate national rights of the Kurdish people, implementing the principle of equality for minority nationalities, and establishing the idea that all nationalities comprising the people of the Republic of Iraq share democracy."

    The program points out: "The Iraqi Communist Party emphasizes the fact that Iraq is part of the great Arab homeland. Its Arab people are linked to the people of other Arab countries by historical, linguistic, and other common national characteristics. Due to imperialist control and long-term fragmentation, some different economic, political, and cultural conditions have formed among the Arab countries. For this reason, the Arab unification movement has the nature of a liberation movement whose purpose is basically to unite the struggle of the peoples of all Arab countries for liberation and democracy. Therefore, the basic task facing the Arabs is to strengthen their solidarity in struggle and consolidate the cooperation between their liberated countries, as a way to mature the most ideal form of union among them in accordance with the free will of the people and their legitimate desire for unification." The program continues: "The Iraqi revolution is considered a contribution of great significance to strengthening the Arab liberation movement. Therefore, consolidating the Republic of Iraq and strengthening its achievements of liberation and democracy are actually in the interests of the people of all Arab countries. According to this meaning, the fraternal Arab peoples of all countries are considered a strong pillar of the Iraqi people and their liberated republic."

    The program states that the Iraqi people's relentless struggle against imperialism and against the reactionary forces of counter-revolution is objectively linked to the struggle of the people and progressive forces of all countries in the Middle East and around the world. "Therefore, the Iraqi people consider these forces to be strong and steadfast pillars of their just struggle to consolidate the republic and complete the tasks of the revolution. Among these forces are the Soviet Union, the socialist countries, friendly countries, independent countries, as well as the workers' movement, national liberation movement, and peace forces throughout the world."

    When discussing the enemies of the Iraqi national forces, the program points out that these "are imperialism, feudalism and their lackeys and agents—domestic treacherous forces and elements and their espionage networks that conspire against the Republic of Iraq and collude to undermine its national independence and its democratic path." The program continues, stating that "under the policy of opposing the enemies of the revolution to defend the republic, strengthen its liberation-democratic path, and complete the tasks of the new historical stage, the people's patriotic classes and forces—with the support of the forces of peace and freedom throughout the world—work together to achieve the common goals of the people's patriotic classes." The program believes: "There are contradictions between these classes, between their economic interests. These contradictions are usually expressed as some form of political and ideological contradiction. This is manifested in the political programs and actions and ways of thinking of the political parties and politicians representing these classes. Therefore, these contradictions naturally manifest themselves as differences and contradictions in the viewpoints of these parties, especially in relation to the complex issues raised at the present stage. However, these contradictions and differences, no matter how political and ideological their form, are in fact only secondary contradictions within the people compared to the actual contradictions between the revolutionary forces and their hostile forces. Therefore, these contradictions cannot hinder cooperation between the various patriotic political forces to achieve fundamental common tasks that are in the interests of all national classes, and to finally defeat the forces of counter-revolution." "Therefore, the issue of the national united front has extremely great political and historical significance."

    The program emphasizes: "Since workers and peasants constitute the basic and largest social forces in our country, their consolidated alliance becomes a solid foundation for establishing and developing a national front between all anti-imperialist classes and forces, and for the benefit of all of them."

    The program also states: "Cooperation between the various patriotic classes and forces does not mean ignoring the economic, political, and ideological contradictions between them, nor does it mean the dissolution of any political party or group, but rather that each party and group must and can maintain its organizational entity and promote its principles and ideas through democratic means. This naturally does not exclude constructive brotherly mutual criticism among the parties that is in the interests of the people. The concept of cooperation in the national front means putting secondary contradictions and differences in second place, and establishing long-term cooperation between the patriotic classes and, subsequently, between their political representatives, in the economic and political spheres, based on a common national program."

    The program explains that this program of the Iraqi Communist Party does not include socialist goals. The realization of this program will only create material conditions for the country's development towards socialism.

    The final part of the preface states: "Under the independent democratic republican system of Iraq established by the immortal July 14 Revolution, the Iraqi Communist Party will steadfastly adhere to the path of peaceful democracy in its work to achieve all its goals."

    Chapter 1 of the program, "Defending the Republic and Consolidating its Liberation-Democratic Path," states that the Iraqi Communist Party believes it is necessary to "wage a resolute struggle against the enemies of the revolution at home and abroad"; it is necessary to "follow a policy that is in harmony with the will of the people and guarantees the rights of the people," which requires "enabling the people to enjoy their democratic freedoms, freedom of opinion and belief, and freedom to express opinions and beliefs through writing and speech, freedom of assembly, demonstration, strike, and organization of political parties, trade unions, and social organizations," as well as "establishing democratic institutions to complete the foundation of the democratic regime, through which the people can plan national policies (through legal representatives freely elected by the people to the National Assembly and other institutions, through newspapers, patriotic parties, and other democratic means)."

    Chapter 1 of the program also points out: "The Arab unification movement has emerged in modern history as a movement whose essence lies in unifying the struggle of the peoples of Arab countries against imperialism, anti-Zionism, and reactionary feudal systems in order to strive for liberation, democracy, and progress." "Therefore, the path of solidarity struggle by the Arab people to achieve these goals and strengthen political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the liberated Arab countries is the path that can realize and develop the best form of connection between these countries. If we do not pay attention to the unique conditions and circumstances of these countries, do not truly respect the free will of their people, do not pay attention to the need to consolidate the solidarity of the Arabs in the anti-imperialist struggle, and do not establish and develop the democratic achievements and various progressive aspects of the Arab liberation movement, and realize the rights of workers, peasants, and working masses, then this connection cannot serve the interests of the Arabs and their legitimate desire for unification."

    Therefore, the program points out that it is necessary to "consolidate national independence and strengthen the achievements of liberation and democracy that have been achieved by some of the Arab people"; "support the Arab people in Algeria, Oman, and other places who are waging anti-imperialist struggles, and other Arab people who are struggling against reactionary systems, against autocracy, and to eliminate foreign bases and imperialist forces"; "recover the rights plundered from the Arabs in Palestine and deal with the danger of world Zionism and its base, Israel"; "free the Arab League from the way it is dominated and manipulated by reactionary forces and turn it into an effective tool for Arab unity" and "strengthen the friendship and cooperation of Arab countries with countries that truly and sincerely support the Arab liberation movement, especially with socialist countries, and devote efforts to consolidating Afro-Asian solidarity."

    The final part of Chapter 1 points out that the Iraqi Communist Party believes it should "pursue an independent national foreign policy." The basis of this policy is: "defending and consolidating national independence, opposing aggressive treaties and blocs, adhering to the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the principles of peaceful coexistence"; "firmly pursuing a policy against imperialism, preventing the danger of war, and defending peace" and "establishing and consolidating friendly cooperative relations with socialist countries, neutral countries, and other countries that respect our independence and establish relations with us in accordance with the principles of active neutrality and peaceful coexistence and on the basis of sincere friendship and mutual benefit, on the basis of national interests."

    In the second chapter of the program, "Economic Policy," it is pointed out that the basic requirement for making Iraq's national independence complete is to guarantee and complete Iraq's economic independence. Therefore, the Iraqi Communist Party believes that "economic independence is of extremely important significance for consolidating our republic and its progress."

    The program points out: "Realizing this fundamentally requires establishing an independent national economy—free from the exploitation of foreign companies and banks, aimed at increasing industrial and agricultural production. This will be achieved through the completion of land reform, the establishment of national industry in accordance with the direction of a planned economy, the development of natural resources and wealth, the utilization of animal husbandry, the prosperity of commerce, and the strengthening of currency." "In this regard, it is required that the state must use all its capabilities to lead and guide the important sectors of the national economy—not to compete with or weaken national capital, but to open up development paths for it and introduce it into the overall economic plan. This also requires the state to intervene from time to time to eliminate monopolies and speculation, and to eliminate behaviors that hinder the prosperous development of our national economy."

    When discussing the methods to achieve these goals, the program states that we should "realize national industrialization, which will be achieved through mobilizing national resources and production capacity, protecting national industry, and encouraging national capital to develop towards industry"; we should "complete land reform on the basis of making land reform a fundamental reform, in order to eliminate feudal exploitation and the remnants of feudal forces in the countryside, enable millions of peasants to obtain land rights, and improve agricultural production"; we should "prosper and strengthen commerce," "guarantee the legitimate interests of merchants, producers, and others engaged in commercial activities on the basis of supplying the people with necessary goods at the lowest prices, and contribute to protecting and strengthening the national economy"; we should "formulate a sound fiscal policy to ensure the strengthening of currency and provide funds for commercial and company production enterprises in a way that is in line with the tasks of strengthening the national economy and the interests of the people."

    The program also specifically points out that we should "formulate an oil policy in accordance with the interests of the motherland," "increase Iraq's share of oil revenues, and determine relations with oil companies on a purely economic and commercial basis." The program believes that we should "limit the privileges of the companies to the scope of the currently exploited oil wells. Iraq should conduct geological exploration in other areas and make the oil discovered in these areas belong to Iraq."

    Chapter 3 of the program, "Labor and the Working Class," points out: "The working class (as the developing vanguard of the country's basic productive forces) and all working masses play a major role in defending the republic and ensuring its progress and prosperity. The working class (which is the most progressive, most conscious, most selfless, and least selfish class of all social classes) understands that the path to alleviating exploitation and obtaining its own rights is inseparable from developing the revolution on the path of liberation-democracy and building a prosperous national economy." Therefore, we should work to guarantee the legitimate rights of workers.

    Chapter 4 of the program, "Peasant Rights," points out: "Peasants are the main pillar of the revolution and the basic productive force of the country. Therefore, our revolution is essentially considered a peasant revolution, a revolution aimed at freeing millions of peasants from feudal exploitation and tyranny. It goes without saying that liberating this extremely large social force is a prominent symbol of the democratic nature of the revolution and a basic condition for developing our national economy and consolidating the new social system." Therefore, we should "work to take all measures sufficient to ensure that peasants can obtain land rights, help them make the best possible use of the land, enable them to have a considerable standard of living, and guarantee them democratic rights."

    The final chapter of the program, "People's Livelihood," says: "The basic goal of the revolution lies in raising the people's living standards, health, and cultural level. If the realization of these goals fundamentally depends on the development of the national economy and the resulting increase in production and national income, the government can—and it is its urgent task—formulate effective plans within the scope of available resources to solve poverty, unemployment, disease, ignorance, and eliminate backward phenomena in the people's lives."

    伊拉克共产党民族纲领（摘要）
    本报讯　巴格达“人民团结报”1月10日发表了伊拉克共产党民族纲领。摘要如下：
    在这个纲领的序言中说：“伊拉克共产党为完成我们的光荣革命——7月14革命的任务而斗争。我们党在确定这些任务时是以革命性质、我国的条件和我国社会的特点为依据和以科学的社会主义原则为指导的。”
    纲领接着指出：伊拉克的革命“业已打倒了反动的半殖民主义半封建主义的君主制度，已在摧毁这种制度经济的、法律的和思想的基础方面跨进了重大的几步，并在这一制度的废墟上建立了一个独立的解放的反帝）民主的（反封建和反对反动派）共和国。”
    纲领着重指出：“基本上是以使人民摆脱帝国主义控制、封建剥削和旧时代的横暴为方针的7月14日的革命，也是千百万农民、工人和其他人民群众卷入的一个‘人民革命’。在当代的历史条件下，由于社会主义阵营的建立和巩固，由于进步思想日益深入人心以及工人阶级在社会发展中所发挥的先锋作用，这个革命就具有着更为鲜明的‘人民性’和重要性。”
    纲领说：“我们的革命作为一个解放的民主的革命，它的主要任务是：肃清帝国主义势力及其剥削的残余，使国家的独立达到完备和得到加强，肃清封建及其在农村中的残余，把土地分给农民，国家工业化，给人民开放民主自由，提高人民的生活、健康和文化水平。”无疑，“实现这些任务是同保卫共和国和巩固其解放的民主的道路分不开的。”纲领指出，伊拉克当前历史阶段的这些主要任务，是一些不针对资本主义——资产阶级生产关系的解放的民主的任务。“因此，实现这些任务，并不是为了一个阶级的利益而是符合所有人民爱国阶级——工人、农民、小资产阶级（劳动者、手工业者、自由职业者、小农和知识分子）、中等资产级阶即反帝反封建的民族资产阶级（工业家、商人、农民、承包商和民族资本家）的利益的。”
    纲领接着说，确定革命的社会力量，也要求考虑到伊拉克社会的民族结构。伊拉克社会基本上是由两个主要民族——阿拉伯族和库尔德族——和一些少数民族构成的，而阿拉伯人民构成社会多数，“这就必须强调库尔德人民合法的民族权利，对少数民族实现平等原则，确立伊拉克共和国人民所由组成的一切民族共享民主的思想。”
    纲领指出：“伊拉克共产党强调这一事实：伊拉克是阿拉伯大祖国的一部分。它的阿拉伯人民同阿拉伯民族其他各国人民有着历史、语言和其他共同的民族特点的联系。由于遭受帝国主义控制和长期被割裂，阿拉伯各国之间就形成了一些不相同的经济、政治和文化条件。由于这一原因，阿拉伯统一运动就具有了一个其目的基本上在于统一各国阿拉伯人民争取解放和民主的斗争的解放运动的性质。因此，阿拉伯人所面临的基本任务就是：加强他们斗争中的团结，巩固他们的已解放国家间的合作，作为他们间按照人民自由意志及其对统一的合法愿望而使一种最理想的联合形式趋于成熟的途径。”纲领接着说：“伊拉克革命被认为是对加强阿拉伯解放运动作出的一次具有重大意义的贡献。因此，巩固伊拉克共和国和加强其解放的民主的成果，实际上是符合所有阿拉伯各国人民的利益的。根据这一意义，兄弟的各国阿拉伯人民被认为是伊拉克人民及其解放了的共和国的一个坚强支柱。”
    纲领说，伊拉克人民对帝国主义和对反革命的反动势力进行的无情斗争，在客观上同中东及全世界各国人民和进步力量的斗争联在了一起。“因此，伊拉克人民认为这些力量是他们为巩固共和国和完成革命任务而进行的正义斗争的强大的坚定的支柱。在这些力量中有苏联、社会主义国家、友好国家、独立国家以及全世界的工人运动、民族解放运动和和平力量。”
    在谈到伊拉克民族力量的敌人时，纲领指出，这“就是帝国主义、封建主义及其走狗和代理人——国内的叛卖力量和分子及其反伊拉克共和国和伙同破坏其民族独立与它的民主道路的阴谋间谍网。”纲领接着说，“在反对革命敌人以保卫共和国、加强其解放—民主道路和完成新的历史阶段的任务的方针下，人民的各爱国阶级和力量——在全世界和平和自由力量的支持下——通力合作，以实现人民各爱国阶级的共同目标。”纲领认为：“这些阶级之间，在它们的经济利益之间——是有矛盾的。这些矛盾通常表现为政治上的和思想意识上的某种形式的矛盾。这表现在代表这些阶级的政党和政治家的政治纲领和行动与思想方式上。因此，这些矛盾就很自然地又表现为这些政党在观点上的分歧和矛盾，特别是在现阶段所提出的复杂问题方面。但是，这些矛盾和分歧，不管怎样具有政治上的和思想意识上的形式，事实上，和革命力量同其敌对力量之间实际存在的矛盾相比，只不过是人民内部的次要矛盾。因此，这些矛盾不能够阻碍各爱国的政治力量之间进行合作以实现符合一切民族阶级利益的根本性的共同任务，和最后击败反革命力量。”“因此，民族统一阵线问题就具有着极其巨大的政治和历史意义。”
    纲领着重指出：“由于工人和农民构成我国基本的和最大的社会力量，所以他们的巩固联盟，就成为建立和发展所有反帝阶级和力量之间的、并是为了他们全体利益的民族阵线的牢固基础。”
    纲领又说：“各爱国阶级和力量之间的合作，并不意味着无视他们之间经济上、政治上和思想意识上的矛盾，也不意味着任何一个政党和政治集团的溶解，而是每个政党和集团必须也能够保持其组织实体和通过民主方式宣传其原则和思想。这自然并不排除各方之间进行符合人民利益的建设性的兄弟般的相互批评。在民族阵线中合作的概念，意味着把次要矛盾和分歧推到第二位，确立各爱国阶级之间进而在它们的政治代表者之间在经济和政治范围内根据一个共同的民族纲领实行长期合作。”
    纲领说明，伊拉克共产党的这个纲领，并不包括社会主义目标。实现这一纲领只不过为国家向社会主义发展创造物质条件。
    在序言的最后部分谈到：“在为不朽的7月14革命所建立的伊拉克独立民主共和制度下，伊拉克共产党在为实现自己的所有目标而进行的工作中将坚定不移地遵循和平民主道路。”
    在纲领的第一章“保卫共和国和巩固其解放—民主道路”中说：伊拉克共产党认为必须“对国内外革命敌人进行坚决斗争”；必须“遵循一种同人民意志相协调并保证人民权利的政策”，而这需要“使人民能够享有自己的民主自由，见解和信仰及通过写作和言论以表达见解和信仰的自由，集会、示威、罢工、组织政党、工会与社会团体的自由”，以及“建立民主机构使民主政权基础趋于完备，人民通过这些机构能够规划国家政策（通过人民自由地选到国民议会和其他机构去的合法代表、通过报纸、爱国政党和其他民主手段）”。
    在纲领的第一章中还指出：“阿拉伯统一运动在现代史上已作为一个这样的运动而出现：这个运动实质上目的在于统一阿拉伯各国人民反帝、反犹太复国主义、反对反动的封建制度以争取解放、民主和进步的斗争。”“因此，阿拉伯人民为实现这些目的和加强已解放的各阿拉伯国家之间在政治、经济和文化上合作而实行团结斗争的道路，就是可能实现和发展这些国家间最好的联系形式的道路。如果不注意这些国家各国特有的条件和情况、不真正尊重它们人民的自由意志、不注意巩固阿拉伯人在反帝斗争中的团结的必要性以及确立和发展阿拉伯解放运动中的民主成果和各个进步方面、实现工人、农民和劳动群众的权利，那么这种联系就不可能为阿拉伯人利益及其对统一的合法愿望服务”。
    因此，纲领指出，必须“巩固民族独立，加强一部分阿拉伯人民所已取得的解放和民主成果”；“支持阿尔及利亚、阿曼等地进行反帝斗争的阿拉伯人民和其他为反对反动制度、反对专制和肃清外国基地与帝国主义势力而进行着斗争的阿拉伯人民”；“收复阿拉伯人在巴勒斯坦被掠夺的权利，对付世界犹太复国主义及其基地以色列的危险”；“使阿拉伯联盟摆脱支配和玩弄反动手腕的方式，把它变成一个为阿拉伯团结服务的有效工具”以及“加强阿拉伯国家同真实而诚挚地支持着阿拉伯解放运动的国家首先是同社会主义国家的友谊和合作，致力于巩固亚非团结”。
    在第一章的最后指出，伊拉克共产党认为应该“奉行一种独立的民族的对外政策”。这一政策基础为：“保卫和巩固民族独立，反对侵略性条约和集团，坚持万隆会议决议和和平共处原则”；“坚定不移地奉行一种反对帝国主义、防止战争危险和保卫和平的政策”以及“在民族利益基础上同社会主义国家、中立国家和其他尊重我们的独立并依照积极中立和和平共处原则和在真挚友谊与互利基础上同我们建立关系的国家——建立和巩固友谊合作关系”。
    在纲领的第二章“经济政策”部分中指出：使伊拉克的民族独立趋于完备的基本要求是，保证和完成伊拉克的经济独立。因此，伊拉克共产党认为：“经济独立，对巩固我们共和国及其进步来说，是具有极其重要的意义的”。
    纲领指出：“实现这一点，在根本上要求建立一个独立的——摆脱外国公司和银行剥削的、目的在于提高工农业生产的——民族经济。这将通过完成的土地改革，根据一个计划经济的方针建立民族工业，开发自然资源和财富，利用畜产，繁荣商业，加强货币”。“在这方面，要求国家必须以其所有能力来领导和指导民族经济中的重要部门——不是为了同国民资本竞争或加以削弱，而是为了给它开辟发展道路，把它引入总的经济计划。这也要求国家不时进行干预，以取缔垄断和买空卖空，取缔阻碍我国民族经济繁荣发展的行为。”
    谈到实现这些目标的方法时，纲领说，应该“实现国家工业化，这将通过动员国家资源和生产能力，保护民族工业，鼓励国民资本，使之向工业发展”；应该“在使土地改革成为根本性改革的基础上完成土改，以便肃清农村的封建剥削和封建势力残余，使千百万农民获得土地权利，提高农业生产”；应该“繁荣和加强商业”，“在以最低廉价格供给人民必须商品的基础上保证商人、生产者和其他从事商业活动者的合法利益，为保护和加强民族经济作出贡献”；应该“制定一个健全的财政政策，以保证加强货币，通过符合于加强民族经济和人民利益任务的方式给商业和公司生产企业提供资金”。
    纲领还特别指出，应该“根据祖国利益制定石油政策”，“提高伊拉克在石油收益中的份额，在纯粹经济的和商业的基础上确定同石油公司的关系”。纲领认为，要“把各公司的特权限制于目前被开采的油井范围之内。伊拉克在其他地区进行地质勘探，并使这些地区所发现的石油归伊拉克所有。”
    在纲领的第三章“劳动和工人阶级”中指出：“工人阶级（作为国家基本生产力量的正在发展着的先锋）以及所有劳动群众在保卫共和国及保证其进步和繁荣方面起着重大作用。工人阶级（它是各社会阶级中最进步、最有觉悟、最不自私、最不斤斤谋求本阶级私利的阶级）懂得：减轻剥削和获得自己权利的道路，是同使革命在解放—民主道路上发展和建设一个繁荣的民族经济分不开的”。因此，应该致力于保证工人的合法权利。
    纲领在第四章“农民权利”部分中指出：“农民是革命的主要支柱，是国家的基本生产力量。因此，我们的革命在实质上被认为是农民革命，是以使千百万农民摆脱封建剥削和横暴为目的的革命。不言而喻，解放这一极其巨大的社会力量，是革命的民主性质的突出的标志，是发展我国民族经济和巩固新社会制度的基本条件”。因此应该“致力于采取一切足以保证使农民能够得到土地权利、帮助他们尽可能最好地利用土地、使他们有相当生活水平和保证他们有民主权利的一切措施。”
    纲领的最后一章“人民生活”部分中说：“革命的基本目标在于提高人民的生活、健康和文化水平。如果说实现这些目标根本上有赖于民族经济的发展以及由此而来的增加生产和国民收入的增加，但是，政府有可能——也是它的迫切任务——在具有充足资源的范围内制定有效计划，以解决贫困、失业、疾病、愚昧和消灭人民生活中的落后现象。”
