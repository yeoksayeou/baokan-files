Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th. Hebei Province is deeply unfolding an agricultural technical innovation and tool reform movement centered on achieving large-area high-yield production of "1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes" in the drought resistance movement. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months, the province has reformed, created, and repaired more than 10 million pieces of water conservancy and agricultural machinery; more than 20 counties have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of rice and flour processing; 70% of the ten-thousand-pig farms and thousand-pig farms have basically achieved semi-mechanization and improvement, and most canteens have reformed all or part of their cooking utensils. Through technical innovation, a large number of laborers have been freed up to participate in drought resistance and spring plowing production.

The technical innovation movement on the agricultural front in Hebei Province has emerged under the excellent situation of high-speed development of industry and agriculture. After the large-scale farmland capital construction last winter, the conditions for agricultural production have undergone fundamental changes; the county and commune industries throughout the province have formed a manufacturing and repair network that can both manufacture small agricultural machinery and power machinery, and undertake mechanical repair tasks. Therefore, when the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to "vigorously carry out technical innovation centered on tool reform," a magnificent mass movement of "everyone attacking technology, everyone offering ideas" quickly formed throughout the province.

The close cooperation of workers, peasants, and merchants is one of the characteristics of the current technical innovation in Hebei Province's agricultural front, and it is also a further development of the worker-peasant alliance. Many factories have implemented the method of "linking factories and communes, taking responsibility to the end," or planting "experimental fields" in people's communes, vigorously supporting the development of agricultural technical innovation. The Party Committee Secretaries or factory directors of twelve factories, including Chengde City General Machinery Factory, personally took charge and formed leading groups to support agriculture, and led workers and technicians to go deep into the communes to investigate the needs of agricultural technical transformation. According to the requirements of the communes, they formulated plans for the factory's machinery manufacturing, repair, installation, and technical personnel training. When they learned that some county and commune industries lacked equipment, raw materials, and labor for manufacturing drought-resistant machinery in the current drought resistance struggle, they vigorously carried out technical innovation, tapped production potential, and took the initiative to take out some lathes, planers, diesel engines, and other mechanical equipment to support the seventeen comprehensive farm tool repair factories in the communes. At the same time, they adopted the methods of "sending out" and "inviting in," drawing more than 30 technicians from the factory to spread technology to county and commune factories and inviting more than 130 agricultural commune members to the factory to study. In this way, in just two months, the county and commune industries repaired various agricultural and water conservancy tools totaling 144,600 pieces. Commercial employees in various places also went to the forefront of technical innovation to actively support rural technical transformation. The commercial departments in Shijiazhuang Prefecture sent a large number of business personnel to go deep into factories to help solve problems such as raw materials, equipment, and tools, and organized factories to mutually adjust more than 60 tons of raw materials.

In the mass movement of vigorously carrying out technical innovation, all localities conscientiously implemented the policy of "starting from reality, adapting to local conditions, focusing on indigenous methods, using indigenous methods first and then foreign methods, improving and upgrading, and forming complete sets," which not only solved the problem of insufficient technical materials, but also effectively stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for technical innovation. The Yaotou Production Team in Shulu County, because it adopted the method of starting with indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods, created and reformed 86 kinds of tools in more than 20 days, and made the tools for irrigation, cultivation, pig raising, transportation, and other seven aspects into complete sets, greatly improving work efficiency.

In order to make the manufacturing and use of machinery complete, factories and schools have adopted various methods to cultivate agricultural machinery and technical talents for the communes. Colleges and secondary vocational schools in Baoding Prefecture have added short-term professional training classes for communes, or dispatched teachers to rural areas to teach technology, and some schools have established bases in communes for "three combinations" of labor production, scientific research, and technology transfer. In the past month or so, the schools have sent nearly a thousand people deep into the communes and high-yield plots to teach technology.

The new tools invented in various places have been promptly promoted. Since January, provinces, prefectures, cities, counties, and communes have held many on-site meetings for tool inspection, visits, and competitions. The new tools that have been evaluated and finalized have been quickly and widely promoted in various places. After the low-pressure steam water pump successfully trial-produced by Xinle County was promoted throughout the region, a climax of rushing to manufacture low-pressure steam water pumps was immediately set off. In less than a month, more than 2,500 oil drum boiler low-pressure steam water pumps were produced and put into the drought resistance struggle, which made the spring irrigation progress in the region increase sharply from 200,000 mu per day to more than 340,000 mu.

The development of the agricultural technical innovation movement has powerfully promoted the "thousands of millions" large-area high-yield movement. The guaranteed irrigation area in the province has increased from 45 million mu last year to more than 70 million mu, and the spring irrigation area has reached more than 31.8 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 17th. Zhejiang Province is training technical backbones on a large scale, establishing technical research organizations, and establishing technical extension networks to make full preparations for the universal adoption of advanced technologies and new tools in various productions this year. At present, the province has trained more than 1.8 million technical backbones and farm tool operators, averaging more than 2,000 people per commune and more than 50 people per production team.

Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province attach great importance to technical training, and regard training technical backbones as a powerful measure to universally promote advanced experience and promote agricultural technical transformation. According to the local production content, prefectures, counties, and people's communes have formulated plans for training technical forces, and adopted various methods to train technical forces in various aspects such as rice, cotton, jute, sericulture, as well as operators of new tools such as electric plows, double-share plows, rice transplanters, and water pumps. In addition to running training classes at all levels, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, Wenzhou, and Hangzhou and other regions have successively organized technical report groups and promotion groups, which are composed of pacesetters and high-efficiency skilled workers from all aspects to make reports and conduct on-site performances in various places. Production brigades and production teams of various communes generally adopt methods such as running technical night schools, holding on-site meetings and exhibitions, and inviting in and sending out to train farmer technicians and farm tool operators.

At present, the trained technical backbones are spread all over the communes and production teams in the province. Many communes and production teams have established technical research organizations. A strong technical extension network has been formed throughout the province. Many production teams in Ningbo Prefecture have technical captains, cultivators, seeders, soil personnel, fertilizer personnel, and plant protection personnel. Many production teams in Jinhua Prefecture have also established technical research groups.

The various technicians and farm tool operators who have been trained have become the backbone forces in using new farm tools and adopting new technologies in the current spring plowing production. After Pinghu County specially trained steam seedling cultivation technicians, more than 3,600 steam seedling cultivation rooms were quickly established throughout the county, and most of the early rice in the county this year can be cultivated by steam seedling cultivation. After more than 300 farmer technicians in Qingshan Commune in Anji County specially learned the experience of Guangming Team in preventing rotten seedlings, they promoted the entire commune's more than 2,000 mu of seedling fields to do all kinds of equipment to prevent rotten seedlings. Under the leadership and promotion of technicians throughout the province, the early rice sown this year has universally adopted finely selected fine varieties, and more than 90% of the early rice seedling fields are semi-dry seedling fields that are easy to cultivate strong seedlings.

    新华社天津17日电　河北省在以“千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯”大面积高额丰产为中心的抗旱运动中，深入展开农业技术革新和工具改革运动。据不完全统计，两个月来全省已改制、创制和修配水利、农业机具一千多万件，二十多个县实现了米面加工机械化和半机械化；70％的万猪场、千猪场基本实现了半机械化和改良化，大部食堂改革了全部或部分炊具。通过技术革新，已节省出大批劳力参加抗旱和春耕生产。
    河北省农业战线技术革新运动是在工农业高速度发展的大好形势下出现的。经过去冬大规模的农田基本建设，农业生产条件已发生了根本变化；全省县、社工业已经形成一个既能制造小型农业机械和动力机械，又能担负起机械修配任务的制造、修配网。因而当省委提出“以工具改革为中心大搞技术革新”的号召后，很快在全省形成了一个规模壮阔的“人人攻技术、个个献计策”的群众运动。
    工农商大协作是当前河北省农业战线技术革新的特点之一，也是工农联盟的进一步发展。许多工厂都实行了“厂社挂钩、一包到底”，或在人民公社种“试验田”的办法，大力支持农业技术革新的开展。承德市通用机械厂等十二个工厂的党委书记或厂长都亲自挂帅组成了支援农业的领导小组，并带领工人和技术人员，深入公社调查农业技术改造的需要。根据公社的要求，制定本厂的机械制造、修配、安装、技术人员培训等计划。当他们了解到当前抗旱斗争中有些县、社工业缺乏制造抗旱机械的设备、原材料、劳力以后，便大闹技术革新狠挖生产潜力，主动拿出一些车床、刨床、柴油机等机械设备，支援公社的十七个综合性的农具修配厂。同时，采取“派出去”“请进来”的办法，从工厂抽出三十多名技术工人到县社工厂传播技术并请来一百三十多名农业社员到工厂学习。这样，仅两个月的时间县社工业就修配了各种农业、水利工具十四万四千六百多件。各地商业职工也走上技术革新第一线，积极支援农村技术改造。石家庄专区各商业部门，派出大批业务人员，深入工厂帮助解决原料材料、设备、工具等问题，并且组织厂与厂互相调剂原料材料六十多吨。
    在大搞技术革新的群众运动中，各地认真贯彻了“从实际出发，因地制宜，以土为主，先土后洋，改进提高，配套成龙”的方针，不仅解决了技术物料不足问题，而且有效地激发了广大农民技术革新的积极性。束鹿县摇头生产队，由于采取了土法上马、土洋结合的方法，二十多天就创制、改制了八十六种工具，并使灌溉、耕作、养猪、运输等七方面的工具配套成龙，大大提高了工作效率。
    为了使机具制造和使用配套，各工厂、学校都采取多种方式为公社培养农业机械技术人才。保定专区各高等学校、中等专业学校，为公社增添了短期专业训练班，或抽调教师下乡传授技术，有的学校在公社建立了劳动生产、科学研究、传授技术“三结合”的基点。一个多月来，各学校抽出了近千人深入公社、丰产方传授技术。
    各地发明创造的新工具都得到及时推广。1月份以来，省、专区、市、县、公社都召开了多次工具检查、参观、比武等现场会。使已经评选定型的新工具，很快地在各地普遍推广。全区推广新乐县试制成功的低压蒸汽水车以后，马上掀起了一个赶制低压蒸汽水车的高潮。在不到一个月时间里，生产出二千五百多架油桶锅炉低压蒸汽水车投入了抗旱斗争，使全区春灌进度由日浇地二十万亩激增到三十四万多亩。
    农业技术革新运动的发展，有力地推动了“千百万”大面积丰产运动。全省保浇面积已由去年的四千五百万亩增加到七千万亩以上，春灌面积已达三千一百八十多万亩。
    新华社杭州17日电　浙江省各地正在大规模培训技术骨干，成立技术研究组织，建立技术推广网，为今年各项生产普遍采用先进技术和新工具作好充分准备。目前全省已经培训各种技术骨干、农具手一百八十多万人，平均每个公社有两千多人，每个生产队有五十多人。
    浙江省各级党委十分重视技术训练工作，把培训技术骨干作为普遍推广先进经验，促进农业技术改造的有力措施。各专区、县、人民公社都根据当地生产内容，制订培训技术力量规划，采取多种多样方式，培训水稻、棉花、黄麻、蚕桑等各方面的技术力量，以及电犁、双铧犁、插秧机、抽水机等新工具的操作手。嘉兴、宁波、金华、温州和杭州等地区除层层办训练班外，都先后组织技术报告团、促进团，由各方面的标兵和高工效能手到各地巡回做报告，进行现场表演。各公社的生产大队、生产队，一般是采取举办技术夜校、开现场会、展览会以及请进来、派出去等办法，培训农民技术员和农具手。
    目前，已经培训的技术骨干，遍布全省各公社、生产队。许多公社、生产队已经建立了技术研究组织。全省各地已形成了强大的技术推广网。宁波专区许多生产队都有了技术队长、栽培员、种子员、土壤员、肥料员和植保员。金华专区的许多生产小队，也成立了技术研究小组。
    经过训练的各种技术员和农具手，都在当前春耕生产中成为使用新农具采用新技术的骨干力量。平湖县专门训练了蒸汽育秧技术手以后，全县迅速建立起三千六百多间蒸汽育秧室，今年全县大多数早稻可用蒸汽育秧。安吉县青山公社三百多农民技术员专门学习了光明队不烂秧的经验以后，推动全社两千多亩秧田全部做好防止烂秧的各种设备。全省各地在技术员的带头推动下，今年已播早稻普遍采用精选的良种，90％以上早稻秧田都是便于培育壮秧的半旱秧田。
