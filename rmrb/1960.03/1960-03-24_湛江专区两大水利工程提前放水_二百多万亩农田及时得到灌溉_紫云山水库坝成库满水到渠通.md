Zhanjiang Special Zone's Two Major Water Conservancy Projects Release Water Early
    Over Two Million Mu of Farmland Irrigated in Time
    Ziyun Mountain Reservoir Dam Completed, Reservoir Full, Water Reaching Canals

    (Our report) The two large-scale water conservancy projects in Zhanjiang Special Zone, Guangdong Province—the Hepu Reservoir and the northern section of the Leizhou Youth Canal—have released water ahead of schedule to meet the needs of spring plowing. These two projects, which are changing the historically drought-prone face of the Zhanjiang Special Zone, were originally planned to function only during the late-season planting. However, driven by the fight against drought, and after two months of intensive work by hundreds of thousands of people, they are now serving spring agricultural production ahead of schedule. The Hepu Reservoir (including the 62-kilometer-long Huhai Canal connecting the reservoir and the 214-kilometer-long main canal) began releasing water along its entire length at the beginning of this month, allowing 2.1 million mu of farmland in Hepu County to be irrigated early. The northern section of the Leizhou Youth Canal and its large and small canals have been completed, and water has been released ahead of schedule to irrigate more than 200,000 mu of surrounding farmland. The entire 178-kilometer-long canal project is 86% complete and is currently being rushed day and night, striving to complete one section and benefit from it.

    The Leizhou Youth Canal and the Huhai Canal of the Hepu Reservoir are two magnificent projects of moving mountains and creating seas, transforming mountains and rivers. The Youth Canal includes the Hedi Reservoir, which can store 1 billion cubic meters of water, and three other reservoirs, a 178-kilometer-long main channel with a bottom width of over 30 meters, and 100 main canals with a total length of over 400 kilometers, with a total earth and stone work volume of 100 million cubic meters. The Hedi Reservoir, which irrigates an area of 2.5 million mu, and the three Jiegua projects—Wuling, Changqing, and Jiangtou Reservoirs—which irrigate an area of 500,000 mu, were completed successively by the end of last year. The Hepu Reservoir project includes the reservoir area and the irrigation area. The reservoir area consists of three reservoirs—Xiaojiang, Shaishengjiang, and Liuhu—and a water transmission corridor connecting these three reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of over 1.1 billion cubic meters; the irrigation area has a 62-kilometer-long Huhai Canal with a bottom width of 28 meters and 13 main canals with a total length of 210 kilometers, with a total earth and stone work volume of over 39.6 million cubic meters (excluding branch, bucket, and capillary canals, etc.). The construction of these two magnificent projects has transformed the formerly drought-stricken area of "drought occurs after three days without rain" into a water network area with crisscrossing canals and self-flowing irrigation. It can also develop nearly 4 million mu of fertile wasteland in the irrigation area into an ideal planting base for tropical and subtropical crops and sugarcane and oil crops. At the same time, many small hydropower stations can be built along the canal, with a power generation capacity of over 20,000 kilowatts. These two canals can also be used for navigation by motorized sailing boats of 40 to 50 tons, connecting inland rivers, the sea, and mountain traffic. For example, the Youth Canal connects the traffic of Guangdong and Guangxi and connects the waterway from Guangzhou Bay to Tokyo Bay, shortening the 400-kilometer waterway from Zhanjiang to Beihai that detours around the Qiongzhou Strait.

    These two projects were originally planned to be invested 360 million yuan by the state and completed during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Now, the state has only subsidized 55 million yuan, and they have been basically completed in more than a year. Since the start of construction, more than 300,000 migrant workers have built their own sheds, brought their own food, and brought their own tools from the communes. The wages of the migrant workers are all paid by the communes. Except for important equipment and large tools supplied by the state, all other materials are solved by the communes. According to statistics from Leibei County, the grain, equipment, tools, wages, and vegetable funds taken out by the communes throughout the county totaled more than 30 million yuan, averaging more than 900,000 yuan per commune. Especially when this year's spring plowing was seriously threatened by drought, because the commune was large in scale, and workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers were integrated, it was possible to allocate and use manpower and material resources on a larger scale in a unified manner, so that both counties mobilized more than 70% of the labor force to rush to repair day and night, and the eight non-beneficiary communes also mobilized a large number of manpower and material resources to support.

    (Our report) The builders of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir in Jiangxi Province use the idea of ​​treating the entire reservoir as a single chess game to guide the unified coordination of water storage, irrigation, utilization, and management, keeping pace with each other, and maximizing the utilization efficiency of the reservoir, so that the irrigation area of ​​more than 300,000 mu can all be realized in the spring.

    Treating the entire reservoir as a single chess game is the fundamental reason why the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir's dam was completed with full water, and water reached the canals, with the supporting construction and rapid formation of a water conservancy system, including water storage, irrigation, utilization, and management. At the beginning, the idea of ​​four-part support was not clear enough. The command of the reservoir and canal projects was not completely unified, so the progress of the reservoir and the canal was very inconsistent. After discovering the above problems, the Fengcheng County Party Committee promptly adopted the method of "treating the entire reservoir as a single chess game", assigning the canal project to the unified command of the reservoir, transferring the reservoir command personnel to strengthen the leadership of the canal project, and unifying the allocation of labor, so that the progress of the reservoir and canal projects was consistent. When the Fengcheng County Party Committee and the Reservoir Party Committee completed the earth dam project, they inspected the water transmission equipment of the reservoir on the one hand, and at the same time closely linked the various water storage projects, so as to achieve the start of the closing project, the reservoir was able to store water, and with the completion of the closing project, the reservoir blocked and stored 60 million cubic meters of water for spring plowing production, realizing the completion of the dam and the filling of the reservoir.

    Ensuring that the reservoir intercepts floods during the rainy season and exerts irrigation efficiency in spring plowing production is the fundamental requirement for leading the construction of the reservoir. When the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir project entered the final stage, the Fengcheng County Party Committee and the Reservoir Party Committee organized a large number of people to step up the canal project. When the dam was closed, the 150-mile-long irrigation trunk canal was fully completed. At the same time, under the guidance of the idea of ​​treating the entire reservoir as a single chess game, the people's communes in the beneficiary areas also organized forces in a timely manner and dug branch canals in combination with land leveling. The small water-crossing equipment on these canals was also fully installed when the project was completed, so that water reached the canals and met the spring water needs of more than 300,000 mu of land.

    In terms of reservoir organization and management: Because the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir Party Committee realized that building a reservoir and managing a reservoir are equally important, when the reservoir construction task was 70% completed, the county party committee equipped cadres according to the needs of the reservoir, canals, and beneficiaries, and established a complete set of organizational management institutions. A reservoir management office, soil and water conservation station, irrigation water management station, hydropower station, shipping station, and hydrological geology and meteorological outpost were established. In order to fully develop the reservoir's capacity, farms such as breeding and animal husbandry were also established.

    Comprehensive utilization of the reservoir's water resources is the entire purpose of building the reservoir. After the establishment of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir management organization, it purchased equipment and built a 3,000-kilowatt hydropower station. The people's communes near the reservoir also used the reservoir with an area of ​​more than ten square miles and the canal with a width of nine meters and a total length of one hundred and fifty miles to develop the shipping industry. The newly built eight wooden sailing boats have begun to take on shipping tasks. The high mountains in the water storage area around the reservoir lack tree cover, causing serious soil erosion. In order to maintain the reservoir for a longer period of time, the soil and water conservation station has cultivated a nursery and prepared more than one million seedlings, which are transplanted with emphasis. It has also signed contracts with nearby people's communes, planning to plant more than 4,000 mu of forests and completely control the area of ​​soil erosion. In the middle of the reservoir, there is a small mountain with an area of ​​five square kilometers. Now the poultry farm of the reservoir management department has hatched more than 100 nests of improved breed poultry and used the arc-shaped mountain in the water as a base for breeding. In addition, pig, bee, rabbit and other livestock farms are also being actively prepared. Because the reservoir has fish farming conditions such as wide area and deep water, the management department responsible for fish farming has gone to purchase fish fry, planning to raise 20 million fish in the reservoir this year.

    湛江专区两大水利工程提前放水
    二百多万亩农田及时得到灌溉
    紫云山水库坝成库满水到渠通
    本报讯　广东省湛江专区的两项大型水利工程——合浦水库和雷州青年运河北段，提前放水供应春耕需要。这两项改变湛江专区历史性干旱面貌的工程，按照原定计划要在种植晚造时才能发挥作用，但是在抗旱斗争的推动下，经过几十万群众两个月的突击，现在已提前为春耕生产服务。合浦水库（包括连接水库的长达六十二公里的湖海运河和长二百一十四公里的干渠）于本月初旬开始全线放水，使合浦县二百一十万亩农田提早得到灌溉。雷州青年运河北段和大小渠道已经完成，提前放水灌溉了周围二十多万亩农田。全长一百七十八公里的运河全线工程已完成86％，目前正在日夜抢修，力争完成一段受益一段。
    雷州青年运河和合浦水库的湖海运河是两宗移山造海、改造山河的宏伟工程。青年运河包括一个贮水十亿公方的鹤地水库和另外三个水库，一条长一百七十八公里，底宽三十多米的主河道和一百条共长四百多公里的干渠，土石方工程量共达一亿公方。灌溉面积达二百五十万亩的鹤地水库和三宗灌溉面积达五十万亩的结瓜工程——武陵、长青和江头水库，已于去年底先后建成。合浦水库工程包括库区和灌区两部分。库区由小江、晒盛江、六湖三个水库以及连接这三个水库的输水走廊组成，共可蓄水十一亿多公方；灌溉区有长六十二公里、底宽二十八米的湖海运河和十三条共长二百一十公里的干渠，土石方工程量（不包括支、斗、毛渠等灌溉渠道）共达三千九百六十多万公方。这两宗宏伟工程的兴建，使原来“三日不雨便成旱”的苦旱地区变成渠道纵横、自流灌溉的水网地带，还可以把灌溉区内近四百万亩肥沃荒地全部开发起来，成为理想的热带、亚热带作物和甘蔗、油料作物的种植基地。同时，运河沿线可以建立许多小型水电站，发电量可达二万瓩以上。这两条运河还可以通航四、五十吨的机帆船，沟通了内河外海和山区的交通。如青年运河贯通了两广的交通和沟通广州湾到东京湾的航道，从湛江到北海可以缩短绕道琼州海峡的四百多公里航道。
    这两宗工程原计划由国家投资三亿六千万元，安排在第三个五年计划期间内建成。现在，国家只补助五千五百万元，在一年多时间内就基本完成了。施工以来，三十多万民工都是由公社自搭工棚、自带粮食、自带工具。民工的工资全部由公社支付。除重要器材和大型工具由国家供应外，其余物资全部由公社解决。据雷北县统计，全县各公社拿出的粮食、器材、工具、工资、菜金等，折合款项共达三千多万元，平均每个公社达九十多万元。特别是在今年春耕受到严重旱患威胁的时候，由于公社规模大，工农商学兵结成一体，所以能在更大范围内统一调配和使用人力、物力，使这两个县都出动了占70％以上劳动力日夜突击抢修，非受益的八个公社也出动了大批人力、物力支援。
    本报讯　江西紫云山水库的建设者用全库一盘棋的思想，指挥蓄水、灌溉、利用和管理统一配合，步调一致，最大限度地发挥水库利用效能，使三十多万亩灌溉面积，春季全部实现水利化。
  全库一盘棋，是紫云山水库坝成水满，水到渠成，蓄水、灌溉、利用、管理一齐配套，迅速形成水利系统的基本原因。开始，由于四配套的思想不够明确。水库和渠道工程的指挥也没有完全统一，因而库与渠的进度很不一致。中共丰城县委发现上述问题后，及时采取“全库一盘棋”的办法，把渠道工程划归水库统一指挥，抽调水库指挥人员加强渠道工程的领导，统一调配劳力，使水库与渠道两项工程进度一致。丰城县委和水库党委在土坝工程结束时，一面对水库输水设备进行检查，同时就使各项蓄水工程紧紧衔接起来，从而达到合拢工程开始，水库便能蓄水，并随着合拢工程的完成，水库即为春耕生产拦蓄了六千万方水，实现了坝成库满。
    保证水库雨季拦蓄洪水在春耕生产中发挥灌溉效能，是领导水库施工的根本要求。丰城县委和水库党委在水库工程进入收尾阶段时，又组织了大批力量，加紧渠道工程，到坝一合拢，长达一百五十华里的灌溉干渠也就全面完工。同时，各受益地区人民公社在全库一盘棋的思想指导下，也都及时组织力量，结合平整土地开挖了支渠。这些渠上的小型过水设备，也在工程完工时全部安装好，达到水到渠成，满足三十多万亩地的春耕用水。
    在水库组织管理方面：由于紫云山水库党委认识到，建好一座水库与管好一座水库具有同等重要意义，因而在水库施工任务完成70％的时候，即根据水库、渠道和受益的需要，由县委配备干部，建立了一套完整的组织管理机构。成立了水库管理处、水土保持站、灌溉用水管理站、水电站、航运站和水文地质、气象哨。还为充分发展水库能力，成立了养殖、畜牧等场。
    综合利用水库的水利资源，是兴建水库的全部目的。紫云山水库管理组织建立以后，即购置器材，修建了发电三千瓩的水电站。水库附近的人民公社，还利用面积达十余平方里的水库和面宽九米、总长一百五十华里的渠道，发展航运事业。新造的八只木帆船，已开始担负航运任务。水库周围蓄水区的高山，由于缺乏树木披护，造成严重的水土流失现象。为保持水库有较长使用年限，现在水土保持站培育了苗圃，准备了一百多万株树苗，有重点地进行移栽，还和附近各人民公社签订合同，计划造林四千多亩，全部控制水土流失的面积。水库当中有一座面积达五平方公里的小山，现在水库管理部门的家禽场，自己孵了一百多窝良种家禽，利用这座水中的弧山做基地进行饲养。此外，还积极筹备了猪、蜂、兔等畜牧场。由于水库具有面广水深等养鱼条件，负责养鱼的管理部门，已去采购鱼苗，计划今年水库养鱼二千万尾。　（洪崖）
