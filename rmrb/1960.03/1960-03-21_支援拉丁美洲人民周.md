    Support Latin American People's Week
    The people of Latin American countries are holding "Support Latin American People's Week" starting from March 20th. During this week, the people of Latin American countries will launch various gatherings, demonstrations and other activities, expressing their strengthening of solidarity and mutual support in the struggle to safeguard national independence and fight for freedom and democracy.
    "Support Latin American People's Week" was initiated by sixty-six parties and people's organizations in Latin American countries, including the Cuban Workers' Federation, the Cuban "July 26th Movement," the Cuban People's Socialist Party, the Cuban Revolutionary Directorate, the Cuban Federation of University Students, the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and Sovereignty, the Cuban Catholic Young Men's Action Federation, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Nicaraguan Socialist Party, the Nicaraguan Republican Movement, and the Dominican Liberation Movement. The purpose of holding this week is to strengthen international solidarity and cooperation and mutual support throughout Latin America in the struggle against US imperialism, so as to take joint action to more effectively oppose colonialism and dictatorial rule, and to promote a deeper and broader development of the Latin American national democratic movement.
    These sixty-six parties and people's organizations in Latin American countries issued a joint statement on February 17, 1960, calling on mass organizations and people from all walks of life in Cuba and throughout Latin America to hold "Support Latin American People's Week" from March 20 to 26. The statement also called on the people of Latin America to hold various gatherings and protests during the Support Week to express their support for the Cuban revolution, which has been attacked by US imperialism and dictatorial governments and is facing the threat of armed intervention; to support the struggle of the Venezuelan people who are constantly threatened by military rebels serving foreign monopoly groups; to support the heroic struggle of patriots in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Haiti to liberate their people from cruel and bloody dictatorial rule; to support the independence demands of Puerto Rico, which is still a US colony, and the demands for the release of Albizu Campos and others who have been arrested for their desire for their country to achieve freedom and independence; to support the demands for respect for the democratic freedoms of the Argentine people and the trade union rights of workers; to support the struggle of the Panamanian people and the struggle of the Guatemalan people.

    支援拉丁美洲人民周
    拉丁美洲各国人民从3月20日起举行“支援拉丁美洲人民周”。在这一周内，拉丁美洲各国人民将展开各种集会、示威等活动，表示他们在维护民族独立和争取自由民主的斗争中加强团结和互相支援。
    “支援拉丁美洲人民周”是由古巴工人联合会、古巴“7月26日运动”、古巴人民社会党、古巴革命指导委员会、古巴大学生联合会、古巴保卫和平和主权运动、古巴天主教男青年行动联合会、波多黎各国民党、尼加拉瓜社会主义党、尼加拉瓜共和运动党、多米尼加解放运动等拉丁美洲国家的六十六个党派和人民团体发起的。举行这个周的目的是加强整个拉丁美洲在反对美帝国主义斗争中的国际团结合作和互相声援，以采取联合行动来更有力地反对殖民主义和独裁统治，使拉丁美洲民族民主运动更深入和广泛的发展。
    拉丁美洲国家的这六十六个党派和人民团体曾于1960年2月17日发表联合声明，号召古巴和全拉丁美洲的群众组织和各阶层人民在3月20日到26日举行“支援拉丁美洲人民周”。声明还号召拉丁美洲人民在支援周中举行各种集会，提出抗议，以表示支持遭到美帝国主义和独裁政府攻击和面临武装干涉威胁的古巴革命；支持经常遭受为外国垄断集团效劳的军事叛乱分子威胁的委内瑞拉人民的斗争；支持多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和海地的爱国者争取把他们的人民从残酷和血腥的独裁统治下解放出来的英勇斗争；支持现在还是美国殖民地的波多黎各的独立要求和关于释放阿耳维苏·坎波斯及其他由于渴望自己国家取得自由和独立而被捕的人的要求；支持尊重阿根廷人民的民主自由和工人的工会权利的要求；支持巴拿马人民的斗争，支持危地马拉人民的斗争。
