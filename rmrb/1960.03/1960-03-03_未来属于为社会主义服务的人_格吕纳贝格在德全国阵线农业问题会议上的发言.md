The Future Belongs to Those Who Serve Socialism
Grüneberg's Speech at the National Front Agricultural Issues Conference in Germany

Editor's Note: The "Neues Deutschland" published on January 30th a summary speech by Grüneberg, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and chairman of the Party Central Committee's Agricultural Committee, at the National Front conference studying agricultural issues, titled "The Future Belongs to Those Who Serve Socialism." This summary speech pointed out the main tasks currently on the agricultural front in the German Democratic Republic, and emphasized that agricultural production cooperatives are the progress and future of the countryside, that cadres should live and work with the peasants, and carry out effective persuasive education work. The main content is excerpted below:

Agricultural Cooperatives are the Progress and Future of the Countryside

Our peasants must see that the socialist construction of agriculture helps to consolidate our country. Increasing commodity production and the socialist transformation of agriculture are closely linked. Acting in this way will ensure the prevention of the war planners' attempts.

We carried out land reform. At that time, we were thinking about how to develop a new life in the countryside. Later, we established tractor stations to greatly reduce the labor of the peasants. We knew then that establishing tractor stations was not the final step in wisdom. Today, we face even greater tasks. Today, our countryside is embarking on a more beautiful, cultural road.

In recent years, along with the socialist transformation of the countryside, we have also made great achievements in increasing agricultural production. However, this National Front conference once again shows that we are far from satisfied with the achievements we have made. In industry, we have achieved great achievements, but in order to achieve even greater achievements, the working class has organized socialist labor teams and socialist labor collectives. This has also played a role in the rapid development. If we also want to achieve such development in the countryside and quickly overcome the backward remnants of the countryside, then there is no other possibility but to follow the path taken by the working class, that is, to engage in socialist, collective labor.

It is clear from this conference that if we want to accomplish the great goals of the Seven-Year Plan and the main economic tasks put forward by the "Big Five," all forces in the countryside united in the National Front must pay attention to increasing commodity production. This is only possible on the basis of socialist agriculture. Agricultural production cooperatives, this is the progress and future of the countryside. It is important for maintaining peace that peasants work on a cooperative basis, and it is a great task currently to be solved in the countryside to give residents more goods, more meat, oils and milk.

The completion of this task can tell West Germans and (West German) peasants that it is worthwhile to fight against West German militarism and for a peaceful, democratic Germany, and to strive for a vision like the German Democratic Republic. We are building socialism in the center of Western Europe, which makes the capitalist world, especially the people of West Germany, have to consider what attitude they should take towards the German Democratic Republic. Socialist transformation and its positive role in increasing commodity production will have a great influence on the positive forces and peace forces in West Germany.

Here I would like to answer some individual farmers' opinions. Why is it so important for individual farmers to join the cooperatives? The production of individual agricultural operations has reached its limit. Achieving higher commodity production means a great contribution to the cause of peace. We are convinced that it will not be long before West German farmers come to us to see how our agriculture is moving forward and what our countryside is like.

Increasing agricultural production is primarily a matter of increasing labor productivity, and the greatest potential for developing production is the peasants

Science and technology should occupy a greater place in agriculture. Now more than ever, it is necessary to enable farmers to master professional knowledge. It is clear that in order for agriculture to have such development, there must be a group of people with skills, a high level of cultural education, and great talents and knowledge in science and technology and the development of animal husbandry and crop production.

Everyone—even individual farmers—understands that increasing agricultural production is primarily a matter of increasing labor productivity. For example, due to the application of the herringbone milking machine, labor productivity has increased by an average of 400%. This is of course unattainable by individual operations. In the final analysis, decisively increasing agricultural labor productivity is also one of the most important tasks.

The greatest potential for developing agriculture is the people in the countryside themselves. It is possible to utilize the existing potential in the countryside by summarizing many individual experiences and making them serve the interests of the collective. However, we must also expose the shortcomings and mistakes that hinder agricultural development with extraordinary optimism, even though this may sometimes cause pain to some people. If we want to move forward, we cannot be satisfied with what we have achieved, and we must learn to fight.

In order to complete the great task of developing agriculture, socialist labor collectives should be composed of scientists and practitioners

This year we plan to increase the number of dairy cows by 120,000. In 1959, the number of dairy cows only increased by 20,000, and this year we want to increase by 100,000 or more. This requires discussing with every farmer, youth, and everyone in every village how to complete this task.

Our goal is to reach the highest level in the world as soon as possible, and this task is not small. But are the laboring farmers in the countryside worthy of fighting for such a huge and interesting task? When we complete the Seven-Year Plan, milk production will increase to 200%, and milk production will increase by 100% in seven years, which no country in the world has done. This also means that we still have a lot of work to do.

These two facts alone tell us how great the prospects are for our agriculture. It also tells us that science alone cannot solve this task, and it urgently requires us to absorb scientists on a larger scale. For example, if we want to increase the milk production per dairy cow to 3,600 kilograms to 4,000 kilograms, we must reach a production of 8,000 kilograms to 12,000 kilograms or 14,000 kilograms during the peak milk production season. This puts a huge task before science, but science alone cannot complete it. To this end, we should have a great collective including scientists and practitioners. The best road people can take is to establish socialist labor collectives of scientists and practitioners.

Agricultural cooperatives have helped the growth of new people in the countryside Not long ago, I attended a conference of young breeders. It can be seen from that conference that the socialist transformation of agriculture has also greatly promoted the improvement of the technical level of young people. One of the young Communist Youth League members who attended that conference, who was no more than twenty years old, led production in a cooperative. She reported on how she has reached the world level in terms of per-hectare yield of certain agricultural production today. She said that the reason why she was able to mobilize the youth of the whole village to increase agricultural commodity production was because they had cooperatives there. The diverse talents of young people can be brought into play in cooperatives.

Another young woman said at the meeting: Her father had an individual economy, and he did not allow his daughter to participate in the poultry breeding training class. He said, "Then you don't work for me anymore, because, after all, our few chickens are not enough for a poultry breeder!" What does this fact illustrate? It is clear that this type of problem that is constantly being discussed in the countryside today, that is, the problem related to socialist transformation, also helps the formation and growth of new people in the countryside.

The new countryside has created conditions for everyone to fully develop their interests in technology, crops, and animal husbandry.

Agriculture is not isolated, and enterprises should send personnel to support agriculture

In order to live better, we have to utilize all the existing potential in agriculture. Is this just the task of agriculture? No! Here, our friends and workers in industry have made it very clear that they also have a great obligation to agriculture. For example, in terms of feed supply, industry can still do a lot of work, such as chemistry, which can develop urea, etc. Everyone can see that agricultural issues are not isolated issues that can only be discussed and resolved in the countryside, but go far beyond this scope.

Some friends have raised the question: How can we most effectively support cooperatives? Think about it, what does a cooperative with 1,000 hectares to 2,000 hectares of land need after receiving the technical equipment from the tractor station? It needs experienced mechanics and highly skilled engineers. These people should directly ensure the integrity of the technical equipment and its correct and rational application in the cooperative. Yes, we have no other choice but to consider whether it is possible to send trained workers and engineers from industrial enterprises to the cooperatives to master and lead the machinery yards there.

We should create an atmosphere in which all enterprises should undertake certain obligations to increase agricultural commodity production. If we want to complete the great task of increasing agricultural commodity production, we must not only utilize the potential in agriculture, but also utilize the potential in industry.

Cadres should live and work with the peasants and carry out effective persuasive education work

Everyone can see that we can talk about one problem after another, but the main topic we are discussing is still: to maximize the development and increase of agricultural commodity production, we must advance the socialist transformation of the countryside. I think this is the main and important task of the local committees of the National Front in Democratic Germany.

Today, 50% of the cultivated land belongs to the socialist sector, and this fact alone requires us to change the working methods of various parties, mass organizations, and the National Front. The new situation is that the various parties and mass organizations of the National Front are united in solving the main economic tasks and have launched a broad mass movement for this purpose. If we want to achieve great results, we should take a different path from the past. Everyone should learn to correctly estimate the development of society, such as its development in the countryside, and change work and working methods accordingly. This question is also placed before the state cadres. Only when the state cadres truly become the organizers of the economy will we correctly solve all tasks and overcome shortcomings and errors.

Our task is: various parties, mass organizations, and state cadres should live and work together with the peasants in the countryside and carry out effective persuasive education work.

Cultivate agricultural cadres more and faster

The great task of our National Front conference is to organize our agriculture so that it is superior to West German agriculture in all aspects. However, in order to prove the superiority of agricultural production, all forces united in the National Front, various parties and organizations, must develop agricultural production cooperatives and increase agricultural commodity production with all their knowledge and ability.

I have said that colleges should break through the narrow scope of scientific work. Today, we need a huge collective of scientists in various regions, and we need to train cadres in all aspects of our agriculture more and faster. Training cadres has become a very urgent issue, because in the face of such rapid socialist development, we cannot always ask a peasant who only has ten hectares of land today to correctly lead a cooperative with five hundred or one thousand hectares of land tomorrow.

In the past few years, we have sent agronomists from tractor stations to production cooperatives. This has helped us greatly. But this is not enough today. In this regard, rural colleges can meet future needs to a greater extent. At the same time, all forces in society, such as economists, engineers, technicians, teachers, etc., should contribute their strength, even though they have no direct relationship with agriculture.

You can see that the development of socialist agriculture raises new problems that need to be solved every day, providing opportunities for cooperation for the staff of the National Front. Our institutions in various counties, various parties and mass organizations, and state organs should quickly learn to feel that they are responsible for agricultural production cooperatives. We must all be very clear that the huge tasks that agriculture needs to solve at present are not only the affairs of the peasants themselves, but the tasks of all citizens of the German Democratic Republic. The contribution we should make in agriculture is: to make every citizen of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany recognize that the vision and the future can only belong to countries like the German Democratic Republic.

    未来属于为社会主义服务的人
    格吕纳贝格在德全国阵线农业问题会议上的发言
    编者按　“新德意志报”1月30日刊登了德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员、党中央农业委员会主席格吕纳贝格在全国阵线研究农业问题的会议上作的总结发言，题目是
  “未来属于为社会主义服务的人”。这个总结发言指出了德意志民主共和国农业战线上当前的主要任务，并强调指出农业生产合作社是农村的进步和未来，干部应与农民同生活，同劳动，并进行有效的说服教育工作。现将主要内容摘录于后：
    农业社是农村的进步和未来
    我们的农民必须看到，农业的社会主义建设是有助于巩固我们的国家的。提高商品生产和对农业的社会主义改造是紧密结合在一起的。这样来行动，就能保证阻止战争策划者的企图。
    我们进行过土地改革。那时，我们就在想，如何才能发展农村的新生活。后来我们建立了拖拉机站，以便大量地减轻农民的劳动。我们那时就知道，建立拖拉机站并不是智慧的最后一步。今天，我们面前有着更大的任务。今天我国农村正走上一条更美好的、文化的道路。
    最近几年来，与农村社会主义改造的同时，我们在提高农业生产方面，也取得了巨大的成就。可是，这次全国阵线会议又一次表明，我们还远不能满足于已取得的成就。在工业方面我们已取得了伟大成就，但是，为了取得更大的成就，工人阶级组织了社会主义劳动队和社会主义劳动集体。这也对突飞猛进的发展速度起了作用。如果我们也想在农村取得如此的发展，迅速克服农村的落后残余，那么没有别的可能，只能也走工人阶级所走的道路，即社会主义地、集体地从事劳动。
    从这次会议可以看清，如果要完成七年计划的伟大目标和“五大”提出的主要经济任务，团结在全国阵线中的农村中的一切力量必须注意提高商品生产。这只有在社会主义农业的基础上才有可能。农业生产合作社，这就是农村的进步和未来。农民在合作的基础上从事劳动，这对维护和平是重要的，给居民更多的商品、更多的肉类、油脂和牛奶——这是农村当前应解决的伟大任务。
    这个任务的完成可以告诉西德人和（西德）农民，为反对西德军国主义和争取一个和平、民主的德国而斗争，为像德意志民主共和国这样的远景而努力，是值得的。我们在西欧的中心建设着社会主义，这就使资本主义世界，尤其是西德的人们不得不考虑，他们应对德意志民主共和国采取怎样的态度。社会主义改造和它对提高商品生产的积极作用，会对西德的正面力量、和平力量发生极大的影响。
    在这里我想回答一些个体农民的意见。为什么个体农民入社这么重要？个体农业经营的生产已发展到顶头了。取得更高的商品生产就意味着对和平事业的巨大贡献。我们深信，不会太久之后，西德农民便会跑来我们这里，看看我们的农业是怎样朝前迈进，看看我们的农村是怎样的了。
    提高农业生产首先是提高劳动生产率的问题，发展生产的最大潜力是农民
    应该让科学和技术在农业中占有更多的地位。现在比以往任何时候都更需要使农民掌握专业知识。很清楚，要使农业有这样的发展，就必须有一批有技能，有高度文化教养，在科学技术和发展畜牧业及农作物生产方面有巨大的才能和知识的人。
    每个人——甚至个体农民——都懂得，提高农业生产，首先是提高劳动生产率的问题。例如，由于应用了鱼骨形挤乳器，劳动生产率就平均提高了400％。这当然是个体经营所不能达到的。归根结底，决定性地提高农业劳动生产率，也是最重要的任务之一。
    发展农业的最大潜力就是农村的人们自己。把许多个人的经验加以总结，使其为集体的利益服务，这样才有可能使农村现有的潜力得到利用。可是，我们也必须以异常的乐观精神揭露阻碍农业发展的缺点和错误，尽管这有时会使某些人感到疼痛。我们要想前进，就不能满足于已取得的东西，就必须学会战斗。
    为了完成发展农业的巨大任务，应由科学家与实践家组成社会主义劳动集体
    今年我们准备增加乳牛十二万头。1959年，乳牛只增加了二万头，今年我们要增加十万或更多头。这就要求在每个农村同每个农民、青年和每个人讨论如何才能完成这个任务。
    我们的目标是尽快地达到世界最高水平，这个任务不小。可是，农村的劳动农民值得为这样一个巨大的、有趣的任务而奋斗吗？我们在完成七年计划时，牛奶产量将提高到200％，七年内，奶产量将提高100％，这在世界上还没有一个国家做到过。这也就是说，我们还有不少的工作要做。
    单是这两件事实便告诉了我们，我国农业有着多么巨大的远景。它也告诉我们，光靠实践是不能解决这项任务的，它迫切地要求我们更大范围地吸收科学家参加。例如，我们要使每头乳牛的产奶量提高到三千六百公斤到四千公斤，我们就必须在产奶量最高季节达到八千公斤到一万二千公斤或一万四千公斤的产量，这给科学提出了巨大的任务，可是光靠科学，它也不能得到完成。为此，我们应有一个包含科学家和实践家在内的伟大的集体，人们可走的最好的道路就是建立科学家和实践家的社会主义劳动集体。
    农业社帮助了农村新人的成长不久前我参加了一次青年饲养员的会议。从那次会议可以看出，农业的社会主义改造也大大地促进了青年的技术水平的提高。参加那次会议的有一位女青年联盟盟员，年纪不会超过二十岁，在一个合作社领导生产。她报告了她今天是怎样已在某些农业生产的每公顷产量方面达到世界水平的。她说，她之所以能够动员全村的青年去提高农业商品生产，是因为她们那儿有合作社。青年们多方面的才能可以在合作社中得到发挥。
    另外一位女青年在会上说：父亲有着一个个体经济，他不允许女儿去参加家禽饲养训练班，他说：“那你就别再在我这儿工作，因为，毕竟我们这几只鸡还够不上要一个家禽饲养员！”这个事实说明了什么呢？很清楚，今天在农村不断提出讨论的这类问题，即有关社会主义改造的问题，它同时也帮助了农村新人的形成和成长。
    新的农村为每个人创造了条件，他可以全面发展他在技术、作物、畜牧生产方面的爱好。
    农业不是孤立的，各企业应派遣人材支援农业
    为了生活得更好，我们不得不利用农业中现存的一切潜力。这是否只是农业的任务呢？不是的！在这里，我们的朋友们和工业中的工人已说得很清楚，他们对农业也承担有巨大的义务。例如，在饲料供应方面，工业还可以做许多工作，譬如化学方面，可以发展尿素等。大家可以看到，农业问题并不是孤立的、只能在农村讨论和解决的问题，而是远远超出了这个范围。
    有的朋友提出了这样的问题：怎样才能最有效地支援合作社？大家想一下，一个拥有一千公顷到二千公顷土地的合作社，在接受了拖拉机站的技术设备之后，需要的是什么，他需要有经验的机械师和有高度技术的工程师。这些人应直接在合作社中保障技术设备的完整及其正确的、合理的应用，是的，我们没有其它办法而不得不考虑，是否有可能将各工业企业中学成了的工人和工程师派遣到合作社去，以掌握和领导那里的机械场。
    我们应该造成这样一种气氛，即所有的企业，应对提高农业商品生产承担一定的义务。如果我们要完成提高农业商品生产的巨大任务，那么不仅要利用农业中的潜力，而且也要利用工业的潜力。
    干部应与农民同生活、同劳动，并进行有效的说服教育工作
    大家可以看到，我们可以一个问题接着一个地谈，但我们讨论的主要题目仍旧是：要最大限度地发展和提高农业商品生产，就必须使农村的社会主义改造向前发展。我认为，这是民主德国全国阵线各地方委员会的主要的和重大的任务。
    今天已有50％的耕地属于社会主义领域，单是这一事实就要求我们各党派、群众团体和全国阵线改变工作方法。新的情况是，全国阵线的各党派和群众团体团结一致地解决着主要经济任务，并为此而掀起了广泛的群众运动，如果我们想取得巨大的成绩，我们就应该走一条和以往不同的道路，每人都应学会正确地估计社会的发展，例如它在农村的发展，并依据它来改变工作与工作方法。国家机关干部面前也摆着这个问题，只有当国家干部真正成为经济的组织者时，我们才会正确地解决一切任务，克服缺点和错误。
    我们的任务是：各党派、群众团体和国家干部应共同与农民在农村生活，与他们共同劳动，并进行有效的说服教育工作。
      更多和更快地培养农业干部
    我们全国阵线会议的巨大任务是要组织我国的农业，使它在各方面都比西德农业优越。可是，为了证明农业生产的优越性，团结在全国阵线中的一切力量，各党派和团体就必须以全部知识和能力来发展农业生产合作社和提高农业商品生产。
    我已经说过，各学院应突破狭窄的科学工作范围。今天，我们在各专区都需要一个巨大的科学家集体，更多、更快地培养我国农业的各方面干部。培养干部已成为十分急迫的问题，因为在社会主义如此迅速发展的情况下，我们总不能要求一个今天只有十公顷地的农民，明天就能正确地领导一个拥有五百或一千公顷地的合作社。
    过去几年，我们曾把拖拉机站的农艺师派遣到生产合作社。这对我们有过极大帮助。但是今天这已经不够了。在这方面，农村学院可以较大程度地满足将来的需要。同时，社会上的一切力量，如经济学家、工程师、技术人员、教师等，尽管他们与农业并无直接的关系，但也应贡献自己的力量。
    你们可以看到，社会主义农业的发展每天都提出需要解决的新问题，向全国阵线的工作人员提供了合作的可能。我们各县的机构、各党派和群众团体，以及国家机关应该很快学会感到自己应对农业生产合作社负责。我们大家一定很清楚，目前农业要解决的巨大任务，并非只是农民自己的事，而是全体德意志民主共和国公民的任务。我们在农业方面应作出的贡献是：让每个德意志民主共和国和西德的公民认清，远景和未来只能属于像德意志民主共和国这样的国家。
