Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th: A large number of factories and enterprises in Wuhan City completed their February production plans ahead of schedule. Among them, 219 factories and enterprises completed their February production plans in only half a month to twenty days.

Since February, a new upsurge in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has emerged throughout the city, promoting a sharp rise in production. The Jiang'an Vehicle Factory, a Red Flag unit that attended the National Heroes Conference, while vigorously improving the level of mechanization, established fourteen production assembly lines. The flatcar assembly team originally produced eight vehicles per day with twenty-four workers; now, with fourteen workers, they produce sixteen vehicles per day. The entire factory completed the February plan eight days ahead of schedule, with a total output value exceeding the plan by 23.3%. The plan for newly manufactured and overhauled freight cars was fully completed. The average monthly labor productivity exceeded the plan by 4.8%, and the cost of comparable products decreased by 3.5%.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: In Chongqing, by the 25th, 127 factories and mines had completed their February production plans four to eleven days ahead of schedule.

Strengthening leadership and boosting morale are the primary reasons why these factories and mines completed their monthly plans ahead of schedule. The Chongqing Radio Factory Party Committee implemented a system of daily reports, inspections every three days, and evaluations every five days. When problems were discovered, solutions were immediately found, enabling the February plan to be completed ahead of schedule and in an all-round and overfulfilled manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: Twenty-nine electrical machinery factories in Shenyang City have completed their February production plans six days ahead of schedule. The actual output increased by 10.5% compared to last month, and the average daily production level increased by 8%.

    武汉、重庆、沈阳大批工厂上月任务出色完成
    据新华社武汉28日电　武汉市大批工厂企业提前完成了2月份生产计划；其中有二百一十九个工厂企业，完成2月份的生产计划只用了半个月到二十天。
    2月份以来，全市技术革新、技术革命运动出现了一个新的高潮，促使生产直线上升。曾出席全国群英会的红旗单位江岸车辆厂，在大力提高机械化程度的同时，建立了十四条生产流水线，台车组装原来二十四人日产八辆车，现在十四人日产十六辆车。全厂提前八天全面完成了2月份计划，总产值超额23．3％，新造和大修货车的计划全部完成，全月劳动生产率超额4．8％，可比产品成本降低3．5％。
    据新华社重庆28日电　重庆市到25日止，已有一百二十七个厂矿分别提前四天到十一天完成了2月份生产计划。
    加强领导、大鼓干劲，是这些厂矿提前完成月计划的首要原因。重庆无线电厂党委实行一天一汇报，三天一检查，五天一评比制度，发现问题立即找办法解决，使2月份计划提前全面超额完成。
    据新华社沈阳28日电　沈阳市二十九个电机工业工厂已提前六天完成2月份的生产计划，实际产量比上月增长10．5％，平均日产水平提高8％。
