Xinhua News Agency, March 30th, dispatch from Cape Town: Defying the white government’s barbaric suppression and new threats, the people of South Africa continued to strike and demonstrate against the "Pass Laws" on the 29th, and organized the return of the "passes" they were forced to carry to the South African authorities.

　　In the Cape Town area, 50,000 African laborers did not report to work yesterday, and construction work on all major projects continued to be suspended. In the port of Cape Town, all ships were paralyzed due to the dockworkers' strike. The vast majority of workers in some major service departments, such as bakeries, slaughterhouses, and milk farms, also continued to strike. In Johannesburg, the vast majority of African workers continued to refuse to go to work in factories and shops opened by white people.

　　Africans in many places continued to hold demonstrations. In a suburb of Cape Town, about 1,600 Africans demonstrated in front of the local police station to protest the "Pass Laws." In Welkom, a gold mining area, South Africans wrote slogans such as "No Passes" on the walls of the local courthouse and on police vehicles at night. In Grabouw, forty miles east of Cape Town, 2,500 striking workers defied the police authorities' orders to disband and marched in formation. They also organized the throwing of "passes" restricting their movement at the entrance of the city government. Similar incidents also occurred in other parts of South Africa.

　　At the same time, in some parts of South Africa, demonstrations broke out yesterday by Africans fighting for their right to live. In the town of Ermelo, 124 miles from Johannesburg, hundreds of Africans demonstrated against the authorities' increase in rents. The authorities sent police to suppress them and attempted to force the Africans to go to work. When this attempt failed, the police actually opened fire on the demonstrators.

　　The South African Federal authorities not only stubbornly disregarded the condemnation and protests of the South African people and world opinion, insisting on implementing the heinous policies of racial discrimination and persecution, but also announced that they would carry out even more frenzied suppression.

　　The South African Federal Minister of Justice, Erasmus, requested the parliament on the 29th to authorize the South African government to adopt new laws ten times more severe than the current "punishments" to suppress the just struggle of Africans for their most basic rights, that is, to change the original clause of fifty pounds fine or six months imprisonment to five hundred pounds fine and five years imprisonment, plus the punishment of ten lashes.

　　Erasmus also threatened that in addition to deploying police to continue suppressing people everywhere, the government has also ordered the army and air force to be on "alert," and that "the navy and other defense forces are also ready to strike at any time."

　　At the same time, the South African Federal Court is continuing to try Albert Luthuli, President of the African National Congress, attempting to add the charge of "treason" to him.

　　However, the facts of the past ten days have proved that all these new despicable means of the South African Federal Government will also be unable to stop the increasingly large-scale and deeper struggle of the awakened South African people. Luthuli said in court on the 29th that the goal of the African National Congress is to "remove the shackles of oppression on us." He also told a reporter from the "Rand Daily Mail," "The unity and cooperation of all strata of our people demonstrate the sincere desire and urgent need to abolish all racial inequality and discrimination."

    南非人民坚决要粉碎压迫的枷锁
    联邦当局不顾世界舆论谴责宣布要进行更疯狂的镇压
    非洲人罢工示威和反对“通行证法”运动日益深入扩大
    新华社30日讯　开普敦消息：南非人民不顾白人政府的野蛮镇压和新的威胁，在29日继续举行罢工和示威反对“通行证法”，并且有组织地把强迫他们携带的“通行证”退还给南非当局。
    在开普敦地区，昨天有五万名非洲劳工没有上工，所有大工程的建筑工作继续停顿。在开普敦港口，所有船只由于码头工人的罢工而陷于瘫痪。一些主要服务部门如面包店、屠宰场和牛奶场，绝大部分工人也继续罢工。在约翰内斯堡，绝大多数非洲工人继续拒绝到白人开设的工厂和店铺去工作。
    许多地方的非洲人继续举行示威游行。在开普敦郊区，约有一千六百名非洲人到当地警察局前面举行示威，抗议“通行证法”。在金矿地区韦耳科姆，南非人民晚上在地方法院墙上和警察车辆上写上
  “不要通行证”等标语。在开普敦以东四十英里的格拉布夫等地，有二千五百名罢工工人不顾警察当局要他们解散的命令，列队举行了示威游行。他们还有组织地把限制他们行动的“通行证”扔在市政府门口。南非其他一些地方，也发生了类似的事件。
    同时，在南非一些地方，昨天还爆发了非洲人争取生活权利的示威斗争。在离约翰内斯堡一百二十四英里的埃梅洛镇，数百名非洲人举行示威游行，抗议当局提高房租。当局派警察去镇压，并企图强迫非洲人去上工。当这种企图遭到失败后，警察居然向示威者开枪。
    南非联邦当局不但蛮横地不顾南非人民和全世界舆论的谴责和抗议，坚持执行罪恶的种族歧视和迫害政策，而且还宣布要进行更加疯狂的镇压。
    南非联邦司法部长伊来斯马斯29日要求议会授权南非政府采取比现行“惩罚”严厉十倍的新法律来镇压非洲人为争取最起码权利的正义斗争，即把原来的五十英镑罚款或六个月的徒刑的条款改为五百英镑罚款和五年徒刑，另外还加上鞭打十下的惩罚。
    伊来斯马斯还威胁说，除出动警察继续在各地镇压之外，政府也已经命令陆军和空军“警戒”，“海军和其他国防力量也已准备好随时出击”。
    南非联邦法庭同时还在继续审讯非洲人国民大会主席卢图利，企图以“叛国”罪名加在他身上。
    但是，十天来的事实证明，南非联邦政府所有这些新的卑鄙手段也将阻挡不了觉醒的南非人民规模日益扩大的更深入的斗争。卢图利29日在法庭上说，非洲人国民大会的目标是要“铲除压在我们身上的压迫的枷锁”。他并且对“兰德每日邮报”的记者说，“我们人民一切阶层的团结和合作表明了废除一切种族不平等和歧视的真诚愿望和迫切需要。”
