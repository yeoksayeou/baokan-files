Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 20th: The basic construction departments in Tianjin are comprehensively utilizing industrial waste on a large scale, opening up new material sources for building construction. In January and February of this year, the city's construction projects have already used 56,700 tons of industrial waste to replace building materials such as ash, sand, and stone, accounting for 35.2% of the total materials used in the two months. Moreover, the quality of the projects is generally good.

Fully utilizing local resources such as industrial waste is a major technological innovation for the basic construction departments in Tianjin to break through weak links in construction projects and ensure a high-speed leap forward in basic construction. According to preliminary investigations by the basic construction departments, there are currently more than 100 types of local resources, including industrial waste, that can be used to replace building materials. Slag alone amounts to 1.4 million tons per year in the city. More than 40 types of substitutes have now been successfully tested, including slag, iron slag, tailing slag, coal ash powder, waste dolomite powder, alkali residue, and shells. Among them, 22 types of waste have been promoted and used in construction projects by construction units, and the results are very good. When undertaking the construction of the Telecommunications Bureau office building, the Fourth Construction Engineering Company used more than 420 tons of steel slag instead of gravel to cast 260 cubic meters of concrete components. The quality fully met the design requirements, and the cost was reduced by 65% compared to using gravel. The Third Construction Engineering Company established a building material processing base – a production test plant – using coal ash powder from power plants and slag from factories to make silicate blocks, replacing all cement, sand, and stone materials. This type of block is stronger than red bricks and is a new type of building material to replace red bricks for building large buildings. Currently, this test plant can produce more than 11,000 cubic meters of silicate blocks per year, which can be used to build more than five four-story buildings with a total area of 2,600 square meters, saving 600,000 red bricks. Four new material buildings with a total of more than 5,000 square meters have been built using this type of block and have been put into use as civil residences or office buildings for government agencies.

According to the needs of this year's basic construction, the Tianjin Municipal Basic Construction Leading Department has formulated a comprehensive plan for the large-scale utilization of industrial waste, deciding to use industrial waste to replace 1 million tons of building materials this year. The Bureau of Construction Engineering, the Bureau of Building Materials, and other units have established specialized institutions to be responsible for developing industrial waste processing bases and preparing for the construction of slag, steel slag, and shell processing plants. In this way, not only is a strong guarantee provided for the high-speed development of basic construction, but also an average of three fewer trains per day are used to transport building materials from other places, saving transportation capacity.

This newspaper reports: The Shanxi Province building materials industry departments have utilized local natural resources to successfully trial-produce and promote 28 new materials, including diabase cast pipes, lightweight expanded stone materials, leaf resin plastics, large gypsum hollow partition boards, and lightweight concrete.

Based on the situation of the continuous leap forward in basic construction and the rapid increase in the demand for building materials, the Shanxi Province Building Science Research Department and other departments have actively carried out work to exploit local natural resources and expand the sources of building materials. They used diabase stone, which has large reserves locally, and after more than 30 experiments, successfully trial-produced diabase cast pipes to replace cement and steel for making water supply and drainage pipes. Diabase cast pipes are strong and durable, and have a longer lifespan than seamless steel pipes. Shanxi Province has decided to produce them in large quantities. In the research and development of lightweight, high-strength building materials, Shanxi Province has used phyllite to produce lightweight expanded stone materials. This new material is very light, and when fired into large blocks, it can replace both blue bricks and red bricks, and can also speed up construction progress. They used pumice to make lightweight concrete, lightweight heat-resistant concrete, acid-resistant concrete, acid-resistant mortar, silicate products, and pumice powder welding rods; they used natural small-particle pumice to dry-pave on roofs, replacing foam concrete as an insulation layer. They also used high-strength gypsum to make large gypsum lightweight partition boards, and so on. The advantages of gypsum lightweight partition boards are that the surface is smooth and beautiful, no painting is required, and installation is convenient, which can speed up construction.

Building science researchers have also extracted resin from leaves to replace phenolic resin to make plastic products, which are used to replace small hardware and make electrical parts.

Shanxi has large reserves of natural resources such as diabase, gypsum, phyllite, and pumice, and mining is relatively convenient. At present, Datong City, which has large pumice reserves, has established a comprehensive pumice utilization base. The relevant departments have also made arrangements for the comprehensive utilization of gypsum in Taiyuan, the production of expanded stone materials in Houma City, and the production of wet-milled slag concrete in southeastern Shanxi, which can all be produced in large quantities soon to meet the needs of building construction.

    就地取材  保证高速度建设
    天津建筑业用的工业废料占用材量十分之三
    山西利用天然资源制成二十多种新建筑材料
    据新华社天津20日电　天津市基本建设部门大规模地综合利用工业废料，为建筑施工开辟了材料来源。今年1、2月份，全市建筑工程已经利用工业废料代替灰、砂、石等建筑材料五万六千七百多吨，占两个月使用材料总量的35．2％。而且工程质量普遍良好。
    充分地利用工业废料等地方资源，是天津市基本建设部门突破建筑工程中的薄弱环节，保证基本建设高速度跃进的一项重大的技术革新。据基本建设部门的初步调查，目前全市可以用来代替建筑材料使用的工业废料等地方资源多达一百多种，仅炉渣一项，全市一年就有一百四十万吨。现在已经试验成功可以代用的有炉渣、铁渣、调渣、煤灰粉、废白云石粉、碱渣、贝壳等四十多种。其中有二十二种废料已经由施工单位分别在建筑工程中推广使用，效果都很好。第四建筑工程公司在承作电信局办公楼工程时，用四百二十多吨钢渣代替石子浇筑了二百六十立方米混凝土构件，质量完全合乎设计要求，成本比使用石子降低65％。第三建筑工程公司建立了一个建筑材料加工基地——生产试验厂，利用发电厂的煤灰粉、工厂的炉渣等制成硅酸盐砌块，代替全部水泥、砂、石等材料。这种砌块比红砖强度还高，是代替红砖建筑大楼的新型建筑材料。目前这个试验厂一年可生产一万一千多立方米硅酸盐砌块，这些砌块可以建成总面积二千六百平方米的四层楼房五幢多，可节约六十万块红砖。利用这种砌块已经先后建成了四幢共五千多平方米的新料楼，作为民用住宅或机关办公楼，交付使用。
    根据今年基本建设的需要，天津市基本建设领导部门已经制定了大规模利用工业废料的全面规划，决定今年要利用工业废料代替一百万吨建筑材料。建筑工程局、建筑材料局等单位，都分别成立了专业机构，负责开辟工业废料加工基地和筹建炉渣、钢渣、贝壳加工厂等工作。这样，不但为基本建设的高速度发展提供了有力的保证，而且平均每天可少用三列火车由外地装运建筑材料，节省了运力。
    本报讯　山西省建筑材料工业部门利用当地的天然资源，试制成功和推广了辉绿岩铸管、轻质膨胀石材、树叶树脂塑料，大型石膏空心隔墙板、轻质混凝土等二十八种新材料。
    根据基本建设不断跃进，建筑材料需要量迅速增加的情况，山西省建筑科学研究部门等积极开展了挖掘地方天然资源，扩大建筑材料来源的工作。他们利用当地储量多的辉绿岩石，经过三十多次试验，试制成功了辉绿岩铸管，代替水泥、钢铁，制作上、下水管道。辉绿岩铸管质强耐用，比无缝钢管寿命还长，山西省已经决定大量生产。在研究和发展轻质、高强度的建筑材料方面，山西省已经用千枚岩烧制成轻质膨胀石材。这种新材料很轻，烧制成大型的砌块，既能代替青砖和红砖使用，又能加快施工进度。他们用浮石制成了轻质混凝土、轻质耐热混凝土、耐酸混凝土、耐酸砂浆、矽酸盐制品、浮石粉电焊条；用天然小颗粒浮石干铺在屋面上，代替泡沫混凝土作保温层。他们还用高强度石膏制成了大型石膏轻质隔墙板，等等。石膏轻质隔墙板的优点是表面光滑美观，不用粉刷，安装方便，可以加快施工速度。
    建筑科学研究人员还从树叶中提取出树脂代替酚醛树脂，制成塑料制品，用来代替小五金和做电器零件。
    山西各地蕴藏有大批辉绿岩、石膏、千枚岩、浮石等天然资源，开采也比较方便。目前，浮石储量大的大同市已经建立了浮石综合利用基地。有关部门对太原的石膏综合利用、侯马市膨胀石材的生产、晋东南湿碾矿渣混凝土的生产等，也作了安排，不久都可以大批生产，供应建筑施工的需要。
