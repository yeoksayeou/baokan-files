　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 29th. Under the guidance of the ideology of turning drought into a good thing, a large-scale struggle against drought has been launched in various parts of Yunnan. Through the pragmatic, arduous, and skillful work of people of all ethnic groups, the water storage capacity of newly built and existing water conservancy projects in various regions can now guarantee the timely transplanting of approximately 90% of the rice paddies, and the water needs of corn and cash crops are also basically guaranteed. At present, various regions are continuing to rush to repair small-scale water conservancy projects and manufacture water-lifting tools, striving to fully irrigate all farmland and achieve continued leaps forward in agriculture this year.
　　Most areas of Yunnan have not had soaking rain for several months, and the spring drought is becoming increasingly serious. Due to the drought, the temperature in recent months has also been one to two degrees higher than the same period in previous years. However, based on past drought resistance experience and careful observation of crop growth, as long as water conservancy is well managed and farmland irrigation is guaranteed, spring drought is not only not harmful, but can also promote the accelerated growth of crops and achieve a bumper harvest due to increased ground temperature. For example, in Zhaotong Prefecture, located in a high and cold mountainous area, the winter wheat harvested in 1959 and the winter wheat to be harvested this year are both the excellent Nan Da Er Si Yi Jiu variety. Last year's wheat took five months and ten days from sowing to heading; while this year's wheat took less than five months from sowing to heading.
　　The fact that high temperatures during the spring drought can promote the accelerated growth of crops under conditions where water is available has further encouraged the broad masses of commune members to strive for continued leaps forward. Under the leadership of the Party, people of all ethnic groups have invested in a large-scale struggle against drought. Water conservancy projects that can be completed before planting are being accelerated, and a method of simultaneous construction and storage is being adopted, striving for these projects to play a role in spring plowing and production. The more than two hundred large and medium-sized projects currently under construction in the province have stored more than 610 million cubic meters of water. Together with the original water conservancy projects, the province has stored more than 7.5 billion cubic meters of water, and the effective water volume for the spring planting has increased by 2.3 billion cubic meters compared to last year, strengthening the ability to resist drought. Various people's communes have also seized the opportunity to rush to repair a large number of small-scale and temporary water conservancy projects. More than 150,000 temporary canals and river dams have been built throughout the province. In Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, which has the most severe drought in previous years, hundreds of thousands of drought-fighting troops are searching for water sources all over the mountains. In a short period of time, more than 8,900 wells and ponds have been dug, and more than 7,000 ditches have been sealed for irrigation, increasing the irrigated area by more than 170,000 mu.
　　In the struggle against drought, various regions have improved the utilization rate of reservoir water by 20% by calculating water accounts level by level, allocating water to fields, and establishing a water conservation system. For example, after calculating the four major accounts of reservoir inflow, water use, drainage, and evaporation in the Xihe Reservoir in Qujing County, three measures were taken to save water: establishing water distribution stations, promoting shallow water irrigation, and minimizing water transmission losses. As a result, the irrigated area increased from the original 28,600 mu to 89,800 mu.
　　Various regions are also seizing the opportunity to install pumping machinery, rush to repair and manufacture water lifting tools. The 202 new electric pumps and 459 gas pumps added to the province this year must be installed before the end of March. More than 100,000 various water lifting tools have been prepared in various regions. At present, the 24 larger lakes on the Yunnan Plateau are supplying water to farmland day and night.

### 兴水利灭干旱　把坏事变好事  云南掀起大规模抗旱斗争  力争全部农田都能充分灌溉，无雨也要丰收

    兴水利灭干旱　把坏事变好事
    云南掀起大规模抗旱斗争
    力争全部农田都能充分灌溉，无雨也要丰收
    新华社昆明29日电　在变干旱为好事的思想指导下，云南各地掀起了大规模的抗旱斗争。经过各族人民实干苦干巧干，现在各地新修和原有的水利工程，蓄水量已能保证约90％的稻田及时插秧，玉米和经济作物的用水，也基本上有了保证。目前各地正在继续抢修小型水利工程和制造提水工具，力争全部农田都能得到充分的灌溉，争取今年农业继续跃进。
    云南大部分地区已有几个月没有下过透雨，春旱日趋严重。由于干旱，近几个月来的气温也比往年同期高一至二度。但是根据历年抗旱经验和仔细观察农作物的生长情况，只要水利搞好，保证农田灌溉，春旱不仅没有坏处，反而由于地温增高，能够促使农作物加速成长，获得丰收。例如地处高寒山区的昭通专区，1959年收获的越冬小麦和今年即将收获的越冬小麦，都是南大二四一九优良品种，去年的小麦从播种到抽穗历时五个月零十天；而今年的小麦从播种到抽穗还不到五个月。
    在有水的条件下春旱气温高，能促进农作物加速成长的情况，进一步鼓舞了广大社员力争继续跃进的信心和干劲。各族人民在党的领导下，投入了规模巨大的抗旱斗争。对栽种前能完工的水利工程正加紧进行施工，并采取边修边蓄的办法，力争这些工程都能在春耕生产中发挥作用。现在全省正在兴修的两百多处大中型工程已蓄水六亿一千多万立方米，加上原有的水利工程，全省已蓄水七十五亿多立方米，大春有效水量比去年增加二十三亿立方米，加强了抗御旱象的能力。各个人民公社还抓紧时机抢修了大批小型的、临时性的水利工程，全省已兴修了十五万多件临时性的水渠和拦河坝。历年干旱最严重的楚雄彝族自治州，数十万抗旱大军，满山遍野的寻找水源，在短时间内，已打井挖塘八千九百多件，封沟灌流七千多件，新增灌溉面积十七万多亩。
    各地在抗旱防旱斗争中，通过逐级算水账，把水落实到田，建立节约用水的制度，一般使水库水的利用率提高了20％。如曲靖县西河水库算了水库来水、用水、排水和蒸发量等四笔大账后，采取设立配水站、推行浅水灌溉和尽量减低输水损耗率三条措施，节约用水，使灌溉面积由原来的两万八千六百多亩增加到八万九千八百多亩。
    各地还抓紧时机安装抽水机械，抢修和赶制提水工具。今年全省新添的二百零二台电动抽水机和四百五十九台煤气抽水机，都要抢在3月底以前安装好。各地已经备好的各种提水工具共达十万多件。现在，云南高原上较大的二十四个湖泊，正日夜不停向农田供水。
