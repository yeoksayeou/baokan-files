    Their Thoughts Shine with the Light of Communism
    Saving State Property: Heroes Risk Their Lives

    Near Kiev, in the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union, on a night so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, flames suddenly erupted into the sky. A technical repair station was on fire. Young people attending an evening party at a nearby club rushed to the scene of the fire.

    It turned out that thirteen tractors were parked in the repair shop. The flames grew larger and larger, and it was impossible to quickly extinguish them. The only way out was to drag the tractors out.

    Boris Arkhipenko, a collective farm driver and Communist Party member, was the first to bravely rush into the burning building. Others followed. In the thick smoke and flames, these brave people dragged the tractors out one by one. When only a few tractors remained in the shop, the roof collapsed. Arkhipenko unfortunately sacrificed his life. Another Communist Party member, Vladimir Pukaz, continued to rescue the tractors until they were all out of danger.

    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Republic issued a commendation for the heroic Communist Party member Arkhipenko, who died a martyr. Pukaz was also rewarded.

    Promoting Class Friendship: Helping Comrades in Need

    One day, the sleeper impregnation factory in the Orenburg Oblast of the Soviet Union held a report meeting with the theme "Communist Sprouts in Daily Life." At the end of the report, Comrade Sevettova, chairman of the factory's women's committee, asked the comrades present to stay for a moment.

    Sevettova said to everyone, "One of our comrades is in difficulty. His wife is seriously ill and in the hospital. His five children at home are left unattended. Their room is also not big enough. I'm talking about Comrade Zhilev, a very modest person. He was allocated a plot of land to build a house, but now he has no energy to build it. Everyone should help him..."

    Before she could finish, a worker stood up and said, "The most important thing is to help Comrade Zhilev build a house before it gets cold in the autumn. I am a stove builder, and I guarantee to help him build a stove in my spare time."

    The workers present spoke up one after another:

    "My brother and I are carpenters, and we are responsible for laying the floor and making the doors and windows."

    "I am a glazier, and glazing is my specialty."

    "The women present guarantee to take turns going to his home to take care of the children, help with cooking and laundry."

    It is impossible to list all the speakers and suggestions for volunteering to help. It is worth mentioning that Comrade Zhilev himself was not at the meeting that day.

    A few months later, with the help of the factory comrades, Zhilev's house was built, and his wife's illness was cured. Under the care of the collective, his family lived a warm and happy life.

    他们的思想闪耀着共产主义的光芒
    抢救国家财产  英雄奋不顾身
    苏联乌克兰共和国的基辅近郊，一个伸手不见五指的晚上，突然一股火舌腾空而起。一个技术修理站的建筑物失火了。在近旁的俱乐部里正在举办青年晚会，青年们争先恐后地向失火地点奔去。
    原来在修理车间里停放着十三台拖拉机。火焰越烧越大，当时要迅速扑灭火焰已经不可能。唯一的出路是：把拖拉机拖出来。
    集体农庄司机、共产党员鲍里斯·阿尔基敏科首先奋不顾身地冲进燃烧着的建筑物里。其他的人也跟着冲进去。在浓烟烈火中，这些英勇的人把拖拉机一台台地拖出来。当车间里只剩下最后几台拖拉机时，屋顶崩陷了。阿尔基敏科不幸牺牲。另一位共产党员弗拉基米尔·普卡兹继续抢救拖拉机，一直到全部出险。
    乌克兰共和国最高苏维埃主席团通令嘉奖英勇牺牲的共产党员阿尔基敏科。普卡兹也受到奖励。
    发挥阶级友爱  帮助困难同志
    有一天，苏联奥林布尔州枕木防腐工厂举行报告会，报告的题目是“日常生活中的共产主义幼芽”。报告结束时，工厂妇女委员会主席谢维托娃请到会的同志暂留一下。
    谢维托娃向大家说：“我们厂里有一位同志发生了困难。他的妻子生了重病，住在医院。家里的五个小孩无人照顾。房间也不够用。我说的是日列夫同志，他是一个很谦逊的人。本来已经拨给他盖房子的地段，现在他也无余力修建。大家应该帮助他，……”
    话未说完，一位工人站起来说：“最主要的是要帮助日列夫同志在秋凉前盖起房子来。我是砌炉工，我保证在业余时间帮他砌一个炉子。”
    到会的工人争先恐后的发言：
    “我们弟兄俩是木工，我们负责铺起地板，做好门窗。”
    “我是玻璃工，镶玻璃是我拿手的活。”
    “我们到会的妇女保证按次序地到他家里去照料小孩，帮助烧饭、洗衣。”
    发言的人和志愿帮助别人的建议无法一一列举。有必要提出的是，日列夫同志本人当天并没有在会场上。
    过了几个月，在工厂同志们的帮助下，日列夫的房子盖起来了，他妻子的病也好了。他的一家，在集体的关怀下，过着温暖幸福的日子。
