Double Planting for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Double Harvest for Grain and Livestock
By our commentator

Immediately launching a spring breeding and reproduction campaign for large livestock nationwide, ensuring that all mature female animals are impregnated, striving to achieve full mating, full success, full birth, full survival, and full vigor, is a very important task for increasing large livestock at high speed, and also one of the central tasks of spring production in rural areas.

"If you don't sow in spring, you won't reap in autumn," this saying also applies to animal husbandry production. Spring is a great season for breeding large livestock. This is not only because female animals are highly fertile and easily conceive in spring, but more importantly, breeding in spring allows offspring to be born in late winter and early spring of this year or next year, which can better complete this year's plan for increasing large livestock. Moreover, the time of birth can be staggered from the busy farming season, which has little or no impact on draft labor; after the young animals are born for a month or two, it is time for spring grass to sprout, and the livestock can eat fresh and tender feed, which is beneficial to the health of both the mothers and their young. Therefore, all localities should seize this crucial opportunity and launch a concentrated breeding campaign for large livestock.

Some people say, "March for Yellow, September for Water," believing that yellow cattle can only be bred in the third month of the lunar calendar, and water buffalo can only be bred in the ninth month of the lunar calendar; they also believe that large livestock can only have one calf every two years, not one calf per year. In fact, these are reflections of the very slow development of productivity and the extreme fragility of the rural economy in the era of small-scale farming. With the victory of the people's commune movement, the feeding and management of large livestock have been greatly improved due to the adoption of collective feeding methods. The condition of livestock in various places this winter and spring is generally better than in previous years, which has created favorable conditions for early breeding. This year, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Hebei and other provinces started breeding work as early as January. Early breeding and early reproduction are extremely beneficial to the high-speed development of large livestock. Not only is it necessary for large livestock to have one calf per year, but it is also possible. Many communes that have developed large livestock at high speed have already achieved this. For example, in Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, last year 10% of the adult cows gave birth to two calves in two years, and now they are pregnant again. In addition, everyone knows that dairy cows have one calf per year; what dairy cows can do, water buffalo and yellow cattle can also gradually do; the key here is to strengthen livestock feeding management and breeding work.

In order to do a good job in spring breeding, people's communes in various places must quickly organize forces, go deep into the stables, conduct inspections stall by stall and head by head, find out the situation of the female animals, formulate breeding plans, and assign them to production teams; and adopt the method of assigning people to specific animals and guaranteeing mating and conception, implementing this to the feeding rooms. The feeding management of female animals must be strengthened to ensure that they are in heat as soon as possible; breeding sires should be given more grass and feed to enhance their breeding ability. When breeding, we must adopt the method of selecting superior breeds locally and organizing mutual cooperation and surplus-deficit adjustment between regions and communes to solve the difficulty of insufficient breeding stock. Communes and teams should all establish breeding stations, implement the "walking on two legs" approach of both natural mating and artificial insemination, vigorously promote artificial insemination technology, train breeding technicians, and organize a strong professional team for breeding work.

Spring is not only the peak season for breeding and calving of large livestock, but also the busy season for agricultural production. There are indeed some contradictions between breeding and agricultural production, and if arrangements are not made in advance, they will affect each other. Various localities can make arrangements as early as possible and promote various methods according to local conditions, such as "batch mating," "night and early morning mating," "fieldside and troughside mating," "mobile patrol mating," "dispersed inspection and centralized mating," and "training scattered livestock and withdrawing female animals for mating." At the same time, we must also find a way out by vigorously carrying out tool reforms to appropriately reduce the labor intensity of livestock, and especially give necessary care to female animals. Female animals that are currently scattered on the short-distance transportation front and on water conservancy construction sites in rural areas, as well as in enterprises and government agencies, should all be bred in a timely manner to avoid missed mating and empty pregnancies.

During the breeding season, agricultural and animal husbandry departments at all levels should strengthen their leadership in the spring breeding campaign, organize several breeding climaxes, create momentum, boost morale, and carry out large-scale appraisals and inspections. Mate once, check once, and if the mating is not successful, mate again in time, so that all female animals can be fully mated and successfully conceived in the spring.

    农牧双播种，粮畜双丰收
    本报评论员
    在全国范围内，立即开展一个大牲畜的春季配种繁殖运动，使所有的成龄母畜全部怀胎，力争实现全配、全准、全产、全活、全壮，是高速度增殖大牲畜的一项十分重要的工作，也是农村春季生产的中心任务之一。
      “春不种，秋不收”，这句话同样适用于畜牧业生产。春季是繁殖大牲畜配种的大好季节。这不仅因为春季母畜发情旺盛，容易准胎，更重要的是，春季配上种，大都能在今年冬末和明年春初产仔，就能更好地完成今年大牲畜的增殖计划。而且产仔时可以错开农忙季节，对使役影响不大，或没有影响；仔畜出生一两个月后，又到了春草萌发的时候，牲畜能吃到青嫩饲料，有利于母畜、仔畜的健康。因此各地应该抓紧这个关键性的时机，开展大牲畜的突击配种运动。
    有人说：“黄三水九”，认为黄牛只能在农历3月配种，水牛只能在农历9月配种；还认为大牲畜只能两年一胎，不能一年一胎。其实，这些都是小农经济时代生产力发展十分缓慢，农村经济十分脆弱的反映。随着人民公社运动的胜利，由于采取集体饲养的办法，大牲畜的饲养管理已经大有改进。去冬今春各地牲畜的畜膘普遍比往年好，这就为提早配种创造了有利条件。今年陕西、浙江、河北等省早在1月即开展配种工作。早配种、早繁殖，对于大牲畜的高速度发展好处极大，大牲畜一年一胎不仅必要，而且可能。不少高速度发展大牲畜的公社已经做到了这一点。例如江苏省盱眙县去年就有10％的成年母牛都是两年生了两个犊，而现在又怀了胎。另外，大家都知道奶牛都是一年一胎；奶牛能够作到，水牛、黄牛也能逐步做到；这里的关键在于加强牲畜的饲养管理和配种工作。
    为了作好春季配种工作，各地人民公社要迅速组织力量，深入厩舍，逐槽逐头进行检查，摸清母畜情况，制定配种繁殖计划，下达到生产队；并采取定人、定畜和包配、包准的办法，落实到饲养室。对母畜更要加强饲养管理，让它们及早发情；对种公畜要加草加料，增强配种能力。配种时要采取就地选优并组织地区间、公社间互相协作、余缺调剂的办法，解决种畜不足的困难。社社、队队都建立配种站，实行本交与人工授精并举的“两条腿走路”的方针，大力推广人工授精的技术，培训配种技术员，组织起一支强有力的配种工作的专业队伍。
    春季既是大牲畜配种产仔的旺季，又是农业生产的繁忙季节，配种繁殖和农业生产确实存在着一定程度的矛盾，事先安排不好，就会互相影响。各地可及早安排，因地制宜地推广“分批配”、“夜间清晨配种”、“地头槽头配种”、“游动巡回配种”、“分散检查、集中配种”、“训练散畜，抽出母畜配种”等种种办法。同时还要从大搞工具改革上找出路，适当减轻牲畜的劳役强度，特别是对母畜要给予必要的照顾。对于目前分散在农村短途运输战线和水利工地上、以及企业、机关单位的母畜，都应及时配种，不使漏配空怀。
    配种季节中各级农牧部门要加强对春季配种运动的领导，组织几次配种高潮，造声势，鼓干劲，开展大评比、大检查，配一遍，查一遍，没有配准的，及时再配，以便使所有的母畜在春季全配全准。
