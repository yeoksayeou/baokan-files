Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 24th: According to TASS, the head of the Soviet delegation to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, Zorin, stated on the 23rd that if the East and West reach an agreement on the substantive issues of complete and thorough disarmament measures, then the Soviet Union has always believed that the issue of supervision is solvable.

The Soviet delegation's spokesperson on the 23rd informed reporters of the content of the speech made by the head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting held that day. Zorin provided supplementary explanations on the disarmament supervision system at the meeting on the 23rd.

The delegation emphasized that the issue of supervision should be specifically discussed in conjunction with specific disarmament measures, while avoiding the discussion of supervision issues from being detached from the practical tasks of resolving the issue of complete and thorough disarmament and formulating corresponding treaties.

Zorin then said that the Soviet delegation will strive to promote the resolution of the issues arising during the negotiation process. This is the Soviet Union's principled position. The Soviet Union has, more than once, demonstrated this principled position of the Soviet Union in practice. For example, during the negotiations on the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests, the Soviet Union made tremendous efforts to resolve the issues arising in the negotiations. The intolerable delays that have arisen in these negotiations are by no means the responsibility of the Soviet Union.

The reason why the issue of stopping nuclear weapon tests has not been resolved for so long is that some countries want to continue conducting certain nuclear weapon explosions. The negotiations on stopping nuclear weapon tests convincingly demonstrate that the Soviet Union is willing to solve the issue of supervision.

    苏联出席裁军会议代表团指出
    应该结合裁军措施讨论监督问题
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表团团长佐林23日在东西方十国裁军会议上说，如果东西方就全面彻底裁军措施的实质问题达成协议，那末，苏联一向认为监督问题是可以解决的。
    苏联代表团发言人23日把苏联代表团团长佐林在当天举行的十国裁军委员会会议上的发言内容通知了记者。佐林在23日会议上对裁军的监督制度作了补充说明。
    代表团强调指出，应该结合裁军的具体措施，具体地讨论监督问题，而避免使监督问题的讨论脱离解决全面彻底裁军问题和制定相应条约的实际任务。
    佐林接着说，苏联代表团将努力促使解决谈判过程中产生的问题。这是苏联的原则立场。苏联已经不止一次地在实践中表明了苏联这种原则立场。例如，在禁止核武器试验谈判过程中，苏联为解决谈判中产生的问题作了巨大的努力。这次谈判中产生令人不能容忍的拖延情况绝不是苏联的责任。
    目前停止核武器试验问题所以迟迟未能解决是因为某些国家想继续进行某种核武器爆炸。停止核武器试验的谈判令人信服地表明了苏联是愿意解决监督问题的。
