Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar—In the first spring after the realization of agricultural and pastoral collectivization in Mongolia, the Mongolian grasslands are reporting good news of a bumper harvest in the livestock industry. According to a communique released by the Mongolian National Bureau of Statistics on the 14th, as of March, the country had already received 1,334,700 newborn livestock, with a survival rate of 94.9%. The number of surviving newborn livestock this year has doubled compared to the same period in 1959.

Some state-owned farms and regions have achieved outstanding results in newborn livestock survival. The newborn livestock survival rate of five state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, including Baluntulun and Jirgelangtu, reached 100%. Ten provinces across the country achieved a newborn livestock survival rate of over 98%.

According to the plan for the final year (1960) of Mongolia's Three-Year Plan for developing the national economy, the total number of livestock in the country will increase from over 23,895,000 head last year to 24,300,000 head, an increase of 1.6%. This year, under the encouragement of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Congress, the broad masses of Mongolian herdsmen have brought into play even greater enthusiasm for labor, taking measures to further consolidate agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives economically and organizationally. Since last winter, they have been simultaneously ensuring the safe wintering of livestock and making preparations for lambing and protecting the lambs. This has played a good role in ensuring the increase in livestock this spring and has created important conditions for the smooth completion of this year's livestock increase plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 17th—The movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," first initiated a year ago by a labor team of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Bureau, has swept the country. Driven and influenced by this movement, Mongolian cultural and artistic circles have recently organized "Intellectual Socialist Collaboration Groups."

The task of the "Intellectual Socialist Collaboration Group" is to assist the "Socialist Labor Teams" in improving the cultural and technical level of their members, promoting advanced experiences, and helping them arrange their spare time activities. The first "Intellectual Socialist Collaboration Group" in Mongolian cultural and artistic circles was composed of the "Labor Daily" president, poet Darza, painters, doctors, artists, and others. They have established close ties with the labor teams. At present, more than ten such "Collaboration Groups" have emerged in Ulaanbaatar.

In Mongolia, the "Socialist Labor Team" movement, with the slogan "Work, study, and live in a socialist way," began at the beginning of last year. The first to receive the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team" was the labor team of the locomotive repair plant of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Bureau. It put forward the working slogan of "Better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today," advocating carrying out production with a fighting spirit to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution's victory (1961). After this call was issued, it was immediately responded to by many production teams. In December of last year, a production team led by tractor driver Darza of the Kharkhorin State Farm won the title of "Socialist Labor Team," becoming the first "Socialist Labor Team" on Mongolia's agricultural and pastoral front. Duma, a wool-washing worker at the Mongolian Industrial Joint Factory, is the first female captain of a "Socialist Labor Team" in the country. Her wool-washing production team was awarded this glorious title on the eve of the "March 8" International Working Women's Day.

Now, eight "Socialist Labor Teams" have emerged throughout Mongolia. The movement to strive for this glorious title has become a good form for carrying out socialist labor emulation campaigns in various sectors of the national economy. More than two hundred production teams are striving to become "Socialist Labor Teams," and in the Ulaanbaatar railway system alone, more than 1,800 workers are participating in this movement.

    蒙古新春新气象
    畜牧业丰收新生幼畜头数比去年同期增加一倍
    知识界成立协作组帮助工人提高文化技术水平
    新华社乌兰巴托电　在蒙古全国实现了农牧业合作化以后的第一个春天，蒙古草原上传来了畜牧业丰收的喜讯。据蒙古国家统计局在14日发布的公报说，截至3月份为止，全国已经接幼畜一百三十三万四千七百头，成活率达到94．9％。今年成活的幼畜头数比1959年同期增加一倍。
    一些国营农场和地区在幼畜成活方面取得了出色成绩，巴伦图伦、吉尔格朗图等五个国营农牧场的幼畜成活率高达100％，全国有十个省份的幼畜成活率达到98％以上。
    按照蒙古发展国民经济三年计划的最后一年（1960年）的计划，全国牲畜头数将由去年的二千三百八十九万五千多头增殖到二千四百三十万头，即增加1．6％。今年，蒙古广大牧民在蒙古人民革命党第十三届四中全会决议的鼓舞下，发挥更大的劳动积极性，采取措施来从经济和组织上进一步巩固农牧业生产合作社。他们从去年冬天以来就一面保证牲畜安全过冬，一面作好接羔、保羔准备。这对今年春天的牲畜增殖起了很好的保证作用，并为顺利完成今年牲畜增殖计划创造重要条件。
    新华社乌兰巴托17日电　一年前由乌兰巴托铁路局一个劳动队首先发起的争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动已经席卷全国。在这个运动的推动和影响下，蒙古文化艺术界最近又纷纷组织“知识分子社会主义协作组”。
    “知识分子社会主义协作组”的任务是协助“社会主义劳动队”提高队员的文化、技术水平，推广先进经验，帮助他们安排业余生活。蒙古文化艺术界的第一个“知识分子社会主义协作组”是由“劳动报”社长、诗人达尔扎和画家、医师、艺术家等组成的。他们同劳动队建立了密切的联系。目前，乌兰巴托已出现十多个这样的“协作组”。
    在蒙古，以“用社会主义方式来工作、学习和生活”为口号的“社会主义劳动队”运动是去年初开始的。第一个获得“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的是乌兰巴托铁路局机车修理厂劳动队。它提出了“今天比昨天好，明天比今天好”的工作号召，倡议以战斗的精神来进行生产，迎接蒙古人民革命胜利四十周年（1961年）。这个号召发出后，立刻得到许多生产队的响应。去年12月，哈尔霍林国营农场一个由拖拉机手达尔扎所领导的生产队获得了“社会主义劳动队”的称号，成为蒙古农牧业战线上第一个“社会主义劳动队”。蒙古工业联合工厂洗毛女工杜玛是全国“社会主义劳动队”第一个女队长，她所领导的洗毛生产队是在“三八”国际劳动妇女节前夕获得这个光荣称号的。
    现在，蒙古全国已经出现八个“社会主义劳动队”。争取这个光荣称号的运动已经成为国民经济各部门开展社会主义劳动竞赛的良好形式。已有二百多个生产队在争取成为“社会主义劳动队”，仅乌兰巴托铁路系统就有一千八百多名工人参加了这个运动。（附图片）
