    New Shoes Prepared for You with Love
    Zhao Wen
    Wang Xueting, a saleswoman in the shoe and hat section of the "March 8th" store of the Changchun Sixth Department Store, suddenly received a letter one day. She opened it and saw that it was written by a worker. The letter read: "...I want to buy a pair of size 46 leather shoes, but I haven't been able to buy them for a long time. The pair of sneakers on my feet have been patched and sewn again and again, and I really can't wear them anymore. I don't have a home, and no one can make them for me. I read about your exemplary deeds in the newspaper, so I wrote this letter to ask you to help solve this problem..." After reading the letter, Wang Xueting was both happy and surprised. She was happy that this worker comrade trusted her so much, and surprised that she had never seen such a large size shoe before, and whether she could buy it. So, whenever she had time, she ran to the shoe factory, and finally found one that agreed to make a pair. When she gave the shoes to the worker, he was so moved that he couldn't speak...
    Over the past few years, under the education and cultivation of the Party, Wang Xueting has been serving the broad masses of people with such enthusiasm. She has been repeatedly selected as a labor model in Changchun City, a people's representative of the province, and an activist in socialist construction in the province and city.
    When Wang Xueting first started working as a saleswoman, she did not have enough understanding of commercial work. Once, during her time off, she went to another department store to buy shoes for her child. There were not many people in front of the counter, but she called out several times before the saleswoman slowly walked over. When Wang Xueting finished looking at one pair and asked to see another pair, the saleswoman impatiently said, "Are you planning to buy them or not?" Wang Xueting felt very suffocated when she heard this, and left without saying a word. This unpleasant incident troubled her for a long time. She thought: How much of an impact does a saleswoman's bad attitude have on the customer's spirit! Commercial work is also a part of the Party's work and should be valued. So she secretly resolved to improve her work.
    One day, a male customer came to buy shoes with four children. The children's clothes were not ragged, but they were very dirty. Four pairs of small feet, either with toes exposed, or with heels exposed. Wang Xueting thought: The children's feet are dirty and wet, even if they put on new shoes, they won't be warm. She said kindly to the customer, "Please wait a moment, I'll be right back." The customer was about to get angry when Wang Xueting came out, carrying a basin of warm water and a towel. She said, "Children, let me wash your feet and then put on new shoes." After their feet were washed and they put on new shoes, the children were overjoyed. The male customer said embarrassedly, "Comrade, I'm sorry for my attitude just now, please forgive me." Then he said, "The children's mother has been paralyzed for more than a year, and no one takes care of them. Yesterday I got paid, and I thought the children should change their shoes, so I took them out to buy them today; but when I went to a store just now, the saleswoman嫌 (xián - disliked) that the children's feet were dirty, and insisted that they didn't have such a large size, so I left with the children in a fit of pique..." Wang Xueting quickly comforted him: "Don't be sad, this is what our saleswomen should do." She asked the customer to tell her the address, preparing to take time to help him take care of the children in the future; but the customer refused to tell her no matter what, and left with many thanks.
    In the fading twilight, Wang Xueting got off work; however, she did not go home, but went to Zhao Da Niang's house on Yongchun Street. It turned out that Wang Xueting had learned in advance that there were three people in Zhao Da Niang's family, her son was an apprentice in a factory, Zhao Da Ye was often away on business, and only Zhao Da Niang was at home, her eyes were dim, and she was suffering from paralysis, so Wang Xueting wanted to ask her if she needed to buy anything. When she learned that Zhao Da Niang was short of light bulbs, she bought them the next day and sent them over. Zhao Da Niang said with emotion, "You are really a good girl taught by Chairman Mao, even closer to me than my own son." Also, an old woman living on Erma Road had come to the store several times to buy pointed-toe rain boots, but she hadn't been able to buy them. This kind of rain boot is not produced by the rubber factory in Jilin Province, but is imported from Tianjin and Shanghai, so it is often out of stock. Wang Xueting saw that the old woman was tired of running back and forth, so she said to the old woman, "You tell me your address, and I'll send it to you when the goods arrive." The old woman told her the address with some skepticism, thinking: "How could this happen? I haven't seen it in half my life." As luck would have it, this batch of goods arrived that night, and Wang Xueting immediately sent it to the old woman after work. The old woman was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth: "I thought you were just saying it, I didn't expect you to really send it." This old woman often went to see Wang Xueting afterwards, just like her own mother.

    为你准备好心爱的新鞋
    赵汶
    长春市第六百货商店“三八”门市部鞋帽组的营业员王雪亭，一天突然接到一封信。她拆开一看，原来是个工人写的。信上写道：“……我想买一双46号的皮鞋，可是买了很久都买不着。我脚上的一双球鞋已经补了又补，缝了又缝，实在不能穿了。我没有家，没人给做。我曾在报纸上看到过你的模范事迹，所以写了这信请你帮助解决……”看过信后，王雪亭又喜又惊。喜的是这位工人同志如此信任自己，惊的是这样大码子的鞋从来没有见过，是否能买得着。于是她一有空就往鞋厂跑，终于找到一家答应给订做一双。当她把鞋送给那位工人的时候，他感动得说不出话来……
    几年来，在党的教育培养下，王雪亭就是这样热情地为广大群众服务着。她多次被选为长春市的劳动模范、省人民代表，省、市社会主义建设积极分子。
    王雪亭最初作售货员时，对商业工作还没有足够的认识。一次趁休班的时候，她到另一个百货商店去给小孩买鞋。柜台前人并不多，可是她叫了几声，那位营业员才慢慢地走了过来。当王雪亭看完一双，要求再拿一双看看时，那营业员不耐烦地说：“你打不打算买？”王雪亭听见很憋气，没说二话就走了。这件不愉快的事情使她久久不能平静。她想：营业员的态度不好对顾客精神上的影响多大啊！商业工作也是党的工作的一部分，应该重视。于是她暗地下定决心，一定要改进工作。
    一天，一位男顾客带着四个小孩子来买鞋。孩子们衣服并不破旧，但是却很脏。四双小脚，不是露了脚趾头，就是露了脚后跟。王雪亭想：孩子的脚又脏又湿，就是换了新鞋也不暖和。她就和蔼地对顾客说：“请你等一下，我马上就来。”那知那位顾客刚要发火，王雪亭出来了，端了一盆温水，拿了一块毛巾。她说：“小朋友，我给你们洗洗，再换上新鞋。”脚洗完了，换上新鞋，孩子们都高兴得不得了。那位男顾客窘迫地说：“同志，我刚才态度不好，请你原谅。”接着他又说，“孩子妈瘫痪一年多了，没人照顾他们。昨天发了工资，想着孩子们该换鞋了，今天抽空领他们出来买；可是刚才到一个商店去，那个营业员嫌孩子脚脏，硬说没有那样大的号，我一赌气领着孩子走了……”王雪亭忙安慰他：“你别难过了，这是我们营业员应该做的事情。”她要顾客把地址告诉她，准备以后抽空去帮助他照管孩子；但是那位顾客无论如何也不肯说，千谢万谢地走了。
    暮色苍茫中，王雪亭下班了；然而她并没有回家，却朝永春街赵大娘家走去。原来王雪亭事先了解到，赵大娘家三个人，儿子在工厂当学徒，赵大爷有事经常不在家，家里只有赵大娘，她两眼昏花，又患着瘫痪症，因此王雪亭想去问问她需要买什么东西不。当她知道赵大娘缺电灯泡时，第二天就买好给送去了。赵大娘感动地说：“真是毛主席教导出来的好姑娘，比我儿子对我还亲哩。”又有一位住在二马路的老大娘来商店买了几次尖头雨鞋都没买着。这种雨鞋吉林省的橡胶厂不生产，靠天津、上海进货，因此常常缺货。王雪亭看见老大娘跑来跑去怪累的，就对老大娘说，“你把地址告诉我，等来了货我给您送去。”那位老大娘半信半疑地把地址告诉她，心里想：“那会有这号事呢？我活了半辈子都没有见过。”事也凑巧，当天晚上这批货就到了，王雪亭下班后立刻就给老大娘送去。老大娘乐得合不上嘴：“我还寻思你只是说说呢，哪想真的送来了。”这位老大娘以后经常去看王雪亭，真好像她妈妈一样。
