Henan's 330,000 Mess Halls are Solid as a Rock
All Rural People Participate in Public Mess Halls; People Eat Well, Eat Their Fill, and Work Hard
All Mess Halls are Year-Round and Permanent, and the Vast Majority Have Complete Management Systems

(Reported by our newspaper) Henan Province's 330,000 rural public mess halls are as solid as a rock; they cannot be blown over by the wind or scattered by lightning. Public mess halls not only improve the lives of the vast majority of commune members but also serve as an important guarantee for consolidating the people's commune system; they are also a large classroom for cultivating the communist ideological consciousness of the broad masses of peasants in daily life.

The entire rural population of Henan Province participates in public mess halls, and all mess halls are year-round and permanent. After more than a year of construction and improvement, the vast majority of mess halls now have a complete set of management systems, achieving diversification of food and "one hall, multiple stoves," saving grain and firewood. Various localities have also universally carried out cooking utensil reforms. 45% of the mess halls in the province have realized semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, and more than half of the mess halls have vigorously developed the mess hall's own production base, achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and other non-staple foods, while 40% of the mess halls have achieved semi-self-sufficiency.

Over the past year, rural public mess halls in Henan Province have liberated a large number of laborers. Before communization, about ten million women in the province spent their time around the cooking stove all year round. After the establishment of public mess halls, the entire province uses less than two million cooks and management personnel, and women have become the main force in agricultural production. Public mess halls ensure that commune members go to work quickly and in full force. Generally, each laborer can work one or two hours more each day, further developing their labor potential. Last year, Henan was able to achieve a great agricultural harvest despite a severe drought that lasted for more than 100 days. This is closely related to the fact that the mess halls throughout the province were well-run and consolidated, and the labor potential of the commune members was fully utilized. Secondly, it can better ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and save. According to surveys, the living standards of more than 80% of the commune members in the province have significantly improved compared to before joining the public mess halls. In many well-run advanced mess halls, the food has far exceeded that of the "top-notch" wealthy middle peasants in the past. Diseases in the vast countryside have been greatly reduced, and the physical fitness of farmers has been greatly enhanced. Public mess halls not only improve and raise the living standards of commune members but also greatly change people's spiritual outlook. The vast majority of mess halls in the province have simple dining rooms, which are not only collective dining halls but also halls for discussing production and various tasks, as well as classrooms for conducting political and cultural education for commune members. Many mess halls also have libraries and reading boards attached to the dining rooms. Public mess halls have become the center of life and political and cultural activities for the broad masses of commune members, making political and ideological education at various times more thorough. With the further consolidation of public mess halls, the remnants of patriarchalism are further eliminated, democratic and harmonious families are thriving, and everyone is in a happy mood.

The reason why the rural public mess halls in Henan Province are well-run is that Party committees at all levels have conscientiously strengthened their leadership over the mess hall work. From the provincial Party committee to the commune Party committee, welfare offices or welfare departments were established level by level, with the first secretary taking the lead and a secretary specifically in charge. The Henan Provincial Party Committee has emphasized more than once that public mess halls are the main positions for consolidating the people's communes, thus arousing the high attention of Party organizations at all levels. In their daily work, Party committees at all levels have conscientiously implemented the policy of grasping both production and life, arranging, deploying, and inspecting life at the same time as arranging, deploying, and inspecting production. Party committee secretaries at all levels also personally took action, taking the lead in carrying out "experimental fields" for cadres in mess hall work, and also transferred a large number of cadres to participate in mess hall work. Xinxiang Prefecture alone released more than 20,000 full-time cadres and production team branch secretaries to serve as cooks and administrators in the mess halls. Various localities have paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of backward mess halls. Party committees at all levels often transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside, led by the secretaries, to check the teams and mess halls one by one, helping backward mess halls to specifically plan and arrange their lives.

At the same time, Party committees at all levels also paid great attention to purifying the ranks of cooks and management personnel, selecting outstanding Party members, Youth League members, and activists from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds with high political consciousness and impartiality to work in public mess halls. According to incomplete statistics, poor and lower-middle peasants account for 90.7% of cooks and management personnel, and Party and Youth League members account for 34%, consolidating and establishing the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, which has become an important guarantee for the rapid consolidation and improvement of public mess halls. In leading and launching the mass movement to run public mess halls well, all localities have given full play to the role of a complete set of democratic management institutions such as the dining commune member representative meeting and the food management committee. A considerable number of mess halls in the province have now formed a system of holding dining commune member representative meetings regularly. Major issues such as living arrangements, family production base, financial income and expenditure, and management systems are all discussed and decided by the commune member representative meeting or the dining commune member meeting. The food management committee is democratically elected by the commune member representative meeting or the dining commune member meeting. They formulate short-term living plans, adjust daily life, and take turns helping with cooking according to the decisions of the commune member representative meeting, and help study and improve work. In addition, public mess halls in various localities have also universally implemented the "five-on-the-wall" method, including grain consumption standards, living plans, food recipes, financial income and expenditure, and monthly settlement of grain surplus. They have also established suggestion boxes, opinion books, and mobilized commune members to democratically manage and supervise finances, which have played a great role in promoting the consolidation and improvement of mess halls. In order to ensure that the broad masses of commune members eat their fill and eat well, all localities have universally implemented the policy of planned grain use, fixed quotas per person, quotas to households, grain to mess halls, eating with certificates, and saving for oneself. At the same time, they have also established grain and vegetable storage systems, and universally implemented the special storage, special management, and special use of rations, seeds, feed, and reserve grain. The mess halls vigorously grasped vegetable production and collected substitute foods. Last autumn, the entire province launched a campaign of 1,000 jin of fresh vegetables and 100 jin of dried vegetables per person. Public mess halls also used various crop straws and wild plants to produce starch in large quantities. According to statistics from only four prefectures, more than 900 million jin of starch have been produced since last autumn.

Since last autumn, a mass movement to vigorously develop the family production base of mess halls has been universally launched throughout the province. At present, the vast majority of mess halls in the province not only have their own vegetable bases and raise a certain number of pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks but also have established their own flour mills, tofu workshops, and pickle gardens and other small workshops. More than half of the mess halls in the province have achieved "five flavors complete" and self-sufficiency or surplus in vegetables, meat, and eggs due to the vigorous development of the family production base of the mess halls.

Various localities in Henan Province have also conscientiously carried out a large-scale cooking utensil reform movement. At present, the province has promoted a total of 93,200 various improved mills and power mills, more than 270,000 improved stoves, built 180,000 free-flowing water wells, and created and promoted a complete set of advanced cooking utensils such as all-purpose vegetable cutting machines, vegetable washing machines, automatic combined noodle pressing machines, stuffing chopping machines, dumpling wrapping machines, and dishwashing machines, totaling more than 1.3 million pieces. According to preliminary calculations, the province has saved more than 1 million laborers and more than 500,000 head of livestock due to the cooking utensil reform.

    河南三十三万个食堂坚如磐石
    全部农村人口都参加了公共食堂，人们吃得饱、吃得好、干劲足
    所有食堂都是常年的、固定的，绝大部分都有完整的管理制度
    本报讯　河南省三十三万个农村公共食堂坚如磐石，风吹不垮，雷打不散。公共食堂不仅改善了广大社员的生活，而且成为巩固人民公社制度的重要保证；又是在日常生活中培养广大农民共产主义思想觉悟的大课堂。
    河南省的农村人口全部都参加了公共食堂，而且所有食堂都是常年的、固定的。经过一年多的建设和提高，现在绝大部分食堂都有了一套完整的管理制度，达到了饭菜多样化和“一堂多灶”，用粮用柴有节约。各地还普遍开展了炊具改革，全省已有45％的食堂实现了炊具半机械化，半数以上的食堂在大力发展食堂家底生产以后，做到蔬菜肉类等副食品自给，40％的食堂做到了半自给。
    一年多来，河南省农村的公共食堂解放了大批劳动力。公社化以前，全省约有一千万妇女长年围着锅台转。建立了公共食堂后，全省占用的炊事和管理人员不到二百万人，妇女成了农业生产的主力军。公共食堂保证了社员上工快，出工齐，一般每个劳力每天可多做工一两小时，进一步发挥了劳动潜力。去年河南在持续一百多天的严重干旱情况下，能够取得农业大丰收，是和全省食堂办得好，办得巩固，充分发挥了社员的劳动潜力，有着十分密切的关系。其次，能够更好地保证社员吃饱，吃好，吃省。据调查，全省有80％以上的社员的生活水平比入公共食堂以前有显著提高。许多办得好的先进食堂里，饭菜已经大大超过了过去当地“拔尖”的富裕中农。广大农村的疾病大大减少，农民的体质大大增强。公共食堂不仅改善和提高了社员生活，而且大大改变了人们的精神面貌。全省绝大多数食堂都有简易餐厅，既是集体的饭堂，又是讨论生产和各项工作的会堂，也是向社员们进行政治、文化教育的课堂。不少食堂还在餐厅里附设了图书馆、阅报栏。公共食堂已经成为广大社员的生活和政治、文化活动的中心，使各个时期的政治思想教育更加深透了。随着公共食堂的更进一步巩固，家长制的残余进一步消除，民主和睦家庭大兴，人人心情舒畅。
    河南省的农村公共食堂所以办得好，是由于各级党委认真加强了对食堂工作的领导。从省委到公社党委，逐级建立了福利办公室或福利部，第一书记挂帅，有一位书记专管。中共河南省委不只一次地强调指出：公共食堂是巩固人民公社的主要阵地，从而引起了各级党组织的高度重视。在日常工作中，各级党委都认真贯彻了生产、生活一齐抓的方针，在安排、布置和检查生产的同时，也安排、布置和检查生活。各级党委书记还亲自动手，带头在食堂工作中大搞干部“试验田”，还抽调了大批干部参加食堂工作，单是新乡专区就放了两万多名脱产干部和生产队支部书记到食堂担任炊事员和管理员。各地都特别注意了加强对后进食堂的领导，各级党委经常抽调大批干部下乡，由书记带领，分片包干，逐队、逐食堂检查，帮助后进食堂具体地计划和安排生活。
    与此同时，各级党委还十分注意纯洁炊事员和管理人员队伍，选拔优秀党员、团员和有高度政治觉悟、为人公正的贫农、下中农出身的积极分子到公共食堂里去工作。据不完全统计，炊事员和管理人员中，贫农、下中农占90．7％，党、团员占34％，巩固树立了贫农、下中农的领导优势，成为迅速巩固和提高公共食堂的重要保证。在领导开展办好公共食堂的群众运动中，各地都充分发挥了就餐社员代表会和伙食管理委员会等一整套的民主管理机构的作用。全省相当多的食堂现在都已经形成了定期召开就餐社员代表会的制度。有关生活安排、家底生产、财务收支、管理制度等重大问题，都经过社员代表会或就餐社员大会讨论决定。伙食管理委员会是由社员代表会或就餐社员大会民主选举的，他们根据社员代表会决定，安排制定小段生活计划，调剂日常生活，并且轮流值日帮厨，帮助研究改进工作。此外，各地公共食堂还普遍实行了吃粮标准、生活计划、饭谱、财务收支、粮食节余月终结算等“五上墙”的方法，建立鸣放栏、意见箱、意见簿，发动社员民主管理与监督财务，对于促进食堂的巩固和提高，都起了极大作用。为了保证广大社员吃饱、吃好，各地普遍实行了计划用粮，按人定量、指标到户、粮食到食堂、凭证吃饭、节约归己的政策。同时还建立粮食、蔬菜保管制度，普遍实行了口粮、种子、饲料、储备粮的专仓、专管、专用。食堂大抓蔬菜生产和采集代食品。去年秋季全省展开了每人千斤鲜菜、百斤干菜运动。公共食堂还利用各种农作物秸秆和野生植物大制淀粉，仅据四个专区统计，去秋以来共制成淀粉九亿多斤。
    去年秋季以来，全省便普遍开展了大搞食堂家底生产的运动。目前全省绝大部分食堂不仅有了自己的蔬菜基地，喂养了一定数量的猪、羊、鸡、鸭，并且建立了自己的粉坊、豆腐坊和酱菜园等各种小型作坊。全省有半数以上的食堂由于大力发展了食堂的家底生产，已经做到了“五味俱全”和蔬菜、肉类、蛋品等自给或有余。
    河南省各地还认真开展了大规模的炊具改革运动。目前全省共已推广各种改良磨和动力磨九万三千二百盘，改良锅灶二十七万多个，修建吃水自流井十八万眼，创制和推广万能切菜机、洗菜机、自动联合压面条机、剁馅机、包饺机、洗碗机等一整套的先进炊具共一百三十多万件。根据初步计算，全省因为进行了炊具改革，共节省劳力一百多万个，畜力五十多万头。
