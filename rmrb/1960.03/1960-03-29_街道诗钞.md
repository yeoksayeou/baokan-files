    Street Poetry Collection
    Happy events abound on Red Flag Street,
    Everyone sings the song of cooperation,
    You help me, I assist you, becoming the fashion,
    Small drops of strength gather into a river.

    One patch, one heart,
    Each stitch, deep affection,
    Washed and mended, worn on the body,
    Producing, never forgetting the mender.

    Neighborhood Auntie Er, her heart full of joy,
    Listened to the Party Committee's words, wholeheartedly running the canteen.
    Finding Li Ersao in the east, calling Wang Daniang in the west,
    Many people, great strength, immediately set up the canteen.

    Before dawn, the street is noisy,
    Gongs and drums resounding, the canteen opened.

    街道诗钞
    红旗街上喜事多，
    人人都唱协作歌，
    你帮我助成风尚，
    点滴力量汇成河。
    一个补钉一颗心，
    针针线线情意深，
    洗净补好穿身上，
    生产不忘缝补人。
    街坊二大娘，心里喜洋洋，
    听了党委话，一心搞食堂。
    东找李二嫂，西叫王大娘，
    人多力量大，立刻办食堂。
    大天还没亮，街上响叮当，
    敲锣又打鼓，食堂开了张。
