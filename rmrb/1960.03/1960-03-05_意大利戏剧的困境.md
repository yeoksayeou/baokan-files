    The Predicament of Italian Drama

    For several years, Italian drama has been in a difficult situation. Currently, this predicament has deepened to a "decisive" stage. According to statistics, the total number of theater tickets sold in 1950 was seven million, which dropped to four million by 1958. Especially in small cities, the audience seems to have completely lost interest in drama.

    The root of this predicament can be seen from the following facts. The expenses of the Italian drama industry are quite high. Of its total income, 30% must be paid for royalties and taxes, and another 25% for theater rentals, leaving only a portion of the money to cover all other expenses. Even if the performed play is popular, the troupe's other expenses must be raised separately. In this way, the troupe has no choice but to accept state subsidies, and accepting subsidies requires listening to the government's "advice." If the "advice" is not accepted and the government does not like the repertoire, the subsidy will be stopped immediately. Therefore, many troupes have stopped performing to this day.

    意大利戏剧的困境
    几年来，意大利的戏剧一直处在困难的处境中，目前，这种困境已加深到“决定性”阶段。据统计，1950年售出的戏票总数为七百万张，到1958年已下降至四百万张，尤其在小城市中，观众似乎完全失去了对戏剧的兴趣。
    从以下的事实即可看出这种困境的根源是什么。在意大利戏剧业的花费是相当大的。在它的全部收入中必须抽出30％付交版税和捐税，另外25％作剧场的租金，只有把仅剩下的一部分钱用来应付其他所有的开支。即使所演出的剧本很受欢迎，剧团的其他开销也必须另外设法筹措。这样，剧团就非接受国家的补助不可，而接受补助就必须听从政府的“劝告”。如不接受“劝告”而演出政府所不喜欢的剧目时，补助即刻停止。因此，至今还有许多剧团停止演出。
