Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, made a speech entitled "National Sisters! Whip the Horse and Spur it On, Achieve a Continued Great Leap Forward in 1960" at the celebration and commendation meeting welcoming "March 8th" and holding high the red flag for a collective leap forward. The abstract is as follows:

　　The "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is coming soon. In order to welcome this glorious revolutionary festival, our nine people's organizations and the Central People's Broadcasting Station jointly hold this radio conference. I would like to express my warmest congratulations to you, congratulations on the great achievements you have made in socialist construction, and congratulations to the ten thousand "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives for winning supreme glory!

　　At today's meeting, commending and rewarding the "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives is of great significance. Since 1958, under the glorious light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and on the unprecedentedly broad road opened up by the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, the women's movement in our country has embarked on a new stage of realizing complete liberation. Women across the country have made tremendous progress and significant changes in their political thinking, production, learning, and life, and have made great contributions to socialist construction. These ten thousand advanced individuals and advanced collectives are a concentrated reflection of the tremendous progress and significant changes of women across the country; they are the best representatives of the hardworking and brave working women of our country. Commending and rewarding them is their glory, and it is also the glory of our sisters across the country, and it sets an example for our sisters across the country to learn from.

　　The "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives who are commended this time concentrate on demonstrating the excellent qualities of women in our country. That is:

　　First, resolutely listen to the words of the Party and Chairman Mao, and be infinitely loyal to the cause of socialism and communism.

　　From their advanced thoughts and advanced deeds, we deeply realize that only by infinitely loving the Party and Chairman Mao, and going wherever the Party and Chairman Mao point; resolutely supporting the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; firmly taking the socialist road, and cherishing the lofty ideal of realizing communism, can we contribute everything to the current socialist construction, even at the cost of sacrificing our own lives. When we commend the models for the women across the country, we cannot but remember the heroic Xiang Xiuli. She gloriously sacrificed herself to rescue state property, protect the safety of people's lives, and prevent serious explosions. She is a red flag that will never fade, and her infinite loyalty to the cause of socialism and communism, and her courageous and fearless spirit will always be the power to inspire us to move forward. Among our ten thousand "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives, there is also Xu Xuehui, whom everyone is already familiar with. In order to defend the property of the motherland, she tenaciously fought with six knife-wielding bandits. She is a living Xiang Xiuli. There are also Yi Shijuan from Shanghai, Shen Jilan from Shanxi, Yang Yucui from Hunan, Song Xinru from Hebei, Wen Xianglan from Henan, and Fan Xiucai from Gansu. They have all consistently and resolutely taken the socialist road and have consistently taken the lead in production, making outstanding achievements as distinct red flags. They are all good daughters of the Party and the people, and they are also good examples for us to constantly learn from. As long as everyone possesses their ambition and lofty ideals, we will be able to achieve major victories in production and work no matter when and where we are.

　　Second, love labor, actively labor, do not talk about conditions, do not care about rewards, and have a high degree of communist labor spirit.

　　From the examples of the "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives, we can see that each of them is for the purpose of changing the poor and blank face of the motherland, for the noble purpose of realizing the high-speed construction of socialism, and preparing to transition to communism. Therefore, they can fully develop the communist labor spirit, do not talk about conditions, do not care about rewards, work hard and practically, race against time, and consciously and heroically labor. Like the nationally famous female worker Wei Fengying of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory in Shenyang, she has realized 127 technical innovations in more than six years, constantly completed tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded quotas, and created huge wealth for the country. Now she is doing the work for 1969. She never cares about material treatment and personal gains and losses, but is only wholeheartedly for socialism and communism. Like the Tibetan sister Nima Bugu, she took a firm stand in the struggle to quell the rebellion, and tirelessly mobilized the masses to transport ammunition to support the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion. There are also Guo Xian, the female hero in Henan Province who controlled the river; Xu Xiuying, a versatile Mongolian girl on the animal husbandry front; all are not for fame or profit, but wholeheartedly for the red flag of socialism. For socialist construction, we must all continue to develop this spirit of communist labor, and everyone should become a highly conscious social laborer.

　　Third, promote the communist style of collaboration, be selfless and impartial, prioritize the collective, support each other, and take care of the overall situation.

　　Socialist cause is a collective cause. All work needs to be carried out under the leadership of the Party, relying on the strength of the collective, working together, promoting each other, and improving each other in order to complete tasks successfully. The more people and collectives can support each other, the greater the power will be. Mutual assistance and love, and large-scale collaboration, are a brilliant manifestation of the relations of production in our socialist society and are a good way to promote the improvement of the overall social production level.

　　Now, putting the overall interests of socialist revolution and construction first, selflessly supporting others, and seeking common improvement in the communist style have been greatly developed among the people and women of our country; countless advanced figures and deeds of selflessness, putting others first, leaving difficulties to themselves, and making things convenient for others, are emerging everywhere. Like the nationally famous Yi Shijuan group, they not only unite their own group like one person, but also learn from each other with their competitors, exchange experiences, and take the initiative to teach each other as soon as they have new creations. Whoever has technical problems, everyone tries to solve them. They have driven the competition movement of textile workers across the country and have universally improved the technical level. Like the nationally famous cotton planting expert Zhang Qiuxiang, she selflessly helped her competitor overcome difficulties and surpassed herself. They all regard helping others as their own obligation and happiness, care about the collective, engage in large-scale collaboration, and take care of the overall situation, starting from the fundamental and long-term interests. This is the new moral quality of the people and women of our country, and we must constantly promote it.

　　Fourth, develop the spirit of continuous revolution, dare to think and dare to act, and continue to move forward.

　　Our ambition is not only to build socialism, but also to realize the great ideal of communism. Therefore, at any time we are not satisfied with the achievements we have made, and we must strive to move forward in the spirit of continuous revolution. On the road to advancement, we will always encounter some difficulties. But with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the endless power of the broad masses, we can overcome and overcome any difficulties and continue to move forward.

　　From our ten thousand "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives, there are countless such figures and deeds. Like Qu Shuzi, a female lathe worker at Jinan Second Machine Tool Factory, she is a hero who is not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulties, and dares to innovate and create. In August 1959, she completed the workload of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. The quality of the products reached 100%, and she began to work on the work of May 1964. But she was not satisfied. At the end of last year, she successfully trial-produced a screw cap threading machine, which changed the original manual operation to mechanical operation. The original 14 hours and 40 minutes of work now takes only 80 minutes to complete, and the quality is better. Recently, she developed an automatic screw rod punching machine, which can increase work efficiency by 474 times, increase the utilization rate of raw materials to 100%, and save a lot of cutting tools and fuel. She also made the ambition to completely change the screw processing process of her standard parts workshop to automation in 1960. She said: The road is made by people, and the work is done by people. If you stop when you encounter difficulties, when will you reach the communist society? What a heroic statement, only communist fighters have such heroic spirit! There are also Xu Yongji from Xi'an, who dared to attack technical frontiers soon after leaving school, and Zheng Xingzhen from Guizhou, who adopted indigenous methods and continuously conducted scientific research, and have made outstanding contributions to science and technology. We are also very happy to see Han Lanying, the director of the canteen of the Hengshui People's Commune in Henan Province, Cai Bangqiong, a childcare worker in Sichuan, the kindergartens and nurseries in Taiyang Village in Shanxi Province, as well as the Chunhua Street Service Station in Harbin, and the Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Station in Beijing, etc., all of which are red flag pacesetters and red flag collectives that implement the spirit of continuous revolution in organizing collective life. They proceed from production everywhere, think about the masses in everything, and do everything possible to run collective life and welfare undertakings and social service undertakings well; they dare to think and dare to act, and engage in large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, and constantly improve labor efficiency and service quality. Their hard work not only effectively solves the burden of women's housework and children, but also further promotes the development of collective production, promotes the improvement of people's collectivist thinking, and increases the happiness of collective life. They have seen from the most concrete facts that these undertakings themselves are a part of the entire production undertaking, and that production and life promote each other. These seemingly ordinary labors are a noble undertaking in the entire socialist construction; the holding, development, consolidation, and improvement of these undertakings are not small things, but big things; these undertakings have infinitely broad development prospects. Now they are developing towards the direction of comprehensively organizing the collective life of the masses with the spirit of continuous revolution, and further realizing the socialization of housework labor. We must all constantly develop this spirit, further overcome inferiority, liberate our minds, and make ourselves brave, firm, and revolutionary warriors of continuous revolution, and make more new contributions to socialist construction.

　　Fifth, study hard and constantly improve the level of politics, theory, culture, and science.

　　Many sisters have set a good example for us to learn from. Many working-class sisters have studied Chairman Mao's works very well, studying and practicing at the same time, applying them to their work, handling problems, and improving their professional level. Like Wei Shuqin, a salesperson in Harbin, she has studied "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Historical Materialism" and other books in the past year, and wrote more than a dozen papers, and served as a lecturer in the theory study lecture group; she also combined her work to develop an electric shoe fitting device and an electric door. She also took the initiative to sign a master-apprentice contract with new comrades, covering teaching and learning. In terms of cultural learning, especially in terms of literacy, a new climax has been formed among women. The advanced collective in literacy in Qinggu Management District, Wangxian Commune, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, completely eliminated illiteracy in a few months, and universally entered spare-time schools, attacking the scientific and technological fortress. At the same time, they also promoted Mandarin. There is also Li Jinglan, an outstanding elementary school teacher in Lanzhou, who loves children and loves the people's education cause. She said: To educate children, we must have the strong confidence of a soldier attacking a fortress, and the patience and care of a gardener cultivating flowers and plants. She studied hard and actively improved the quality of teaching. The students in the class she taught achieved excellent results in 96% of the cases. So many new people and new things on the theoretical and cultural front are the manifestations of the vast army of women in our country marching towards theory, science, and culture. As long as we break the mystery of learning theory, culture, and science, and study hard and practice diligently, we can learn anything and learn anything well. Everyone must realize Chairman Mao's instruction as soon as possible: "We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."

　　Dear sisters! The "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives have set an advanced example for us. We must unite as one and actively learn from their excellent qualities and advanced experience. The sisters who have been elected as "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives must give full play to the spirit of continuous revolution, always be full of vitality, and constantly make new achievements, and truly become red flags that will never fade; at the same time, they must continue to closely contact the masses, and give full play to the backbone role, bridge role, and leading role among the masses, and better achieve: "Heroes are all around, and advanced people are everywhere." Actively help the surrounding partners and move forward together.

　　The current situation in our country is very good, and we must continue to work hard to seize the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960. Our women must better implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, continue to exert their soaring energy, work heroically, actively participate in technical innovation and technical revolution, and constantly improve labor productivity. The most important thing at present is to actively participate in the nationwide movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and further exert our active role in various production labors. Use our brains, study technology, do what, reform what, innovate in every line, innovate in everything, boldly create, and strive to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations at high speed. In modern enterprises, we must realize automation and semi-automation. In agriculture, we must realize mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification as soon as possible.

　　While actively participating in social labor, our sisters should pay attention to their health and safety, and pay attention to hygiene during menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation.

　　We must also actively participate in and vigorously run collective life and welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, and continue to develop and run public canteens, breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, kindergartens, service stations, sewing groups, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly, etc. From organizing major housework, to developing into a comprehensive organization of collective life, further realizing the socialization of housework labor, transforming scattered, trivial, and ignorance-making housework labor into a collective socialist economic undertaking; gradually making collective life the main way of life in socialist society, in order to adapt to the needs of continuous development of production and meet the urgent requirements of our sisters.

　　We must also continue to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and constantly improve socialist and communist consciousness. Step by step, we must improve our culture, strive to learn scientific knowledge, boldly conduct scientific research, and be determined to climb the peak of cultural science.

　　In order to give full play to the role of our sisters in various positions, everyone must be determined to become advanced women who are red, diligent, clever, and thrifty, and actively participate in the labor competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. In the competition, we must continue to develop the spirit of continuous revolution. The advanced must strive to be more advanced, be not arrogant or impetuous, work hard and unremittingly, learn while working, and always move forward. The backward must strengthen their confidence, improve their ambition, study hard, and strive to change from backward to advanced. Our socialist construction is constantly leaping forward, and we must all go all out and continuously revolutionize and move forward forever.

　　Dear sisters, let us unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, whip the horse and spur it on, leap forward and leap forward again, and bravely advance to realize a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1960!

    全国姐妹！快马再加鞭，实现1960年的继续大跃进！
    蔡畅在首都“三八”广播大会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社5日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅在庆功表模迎“三八”、高举红旗齐跃进广播大会作了题为“全国姐妹！快马再加鞭，实现1960年的继续大跃进。”的讲话，摘要如下：
      “三八”国际劳动妇女节就要到了。为了迎接这个光辉的革命节日，我们九个人民团体和中央人民广播电台联合举行这个广播大会。我向你们表示最热烈的祝贺，祝贺你们在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就，祝贺万个“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体获得的无上光荣！
    在今天的大会上，表扬和奖励“三八”红旗手和“三八”红旗集体，是具有重大意义的。自从1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社开辟的空前宽阔的道路上，我国妇女运动，开始走上了实现彻底解放的新阶段。全国姐妹们不论在政治思想上、生产上、学习上和生活上，都有了巨大的进步和显著的变化，对社会主义建设作出了伟大的贡献。这一万个先进人物和先进集体，正是全国姐妹们这种巨大进步和显著变化的集中反映；她们是我国勤劳、勇敢的劳动妇女的最好代表。表扬和奖励她们，是她们的光荣，也是我们全国姐妹、大家的光荣，又为我们全国姐妹树立了学习的榜样。
    这次受表扬的“三八”红旗手和“三八”红旗集体，集中表现了我国妇女的优良品质。这就是：
    第一、坚决听党和毛主席的话，对社会主义、共产主义事业无限忠诚。
    从她们先进思想、先进事迹中，使我们深深体会到只有无限地热爱党和毛主席，党和毛主席指向哪里，就奔向那里；坚决拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗；坚定地走社会主义道路，怀着实现共产主义的崇高理想，才能在当前社会主义建设中贡献自己的一切，甚至不惜牺牲自己的生命。在我们全国妇女庆功表模的时候，不能不追念英雄的向秀丽。她就是为抢救国家财产，保护人民生命安全，制止严重的爆炸事故，光荣牺牲的。她是一面永不褪色的红旗，她对社会主义、共产主义事业的无限忠诚，勇敢无畏的精神永远是鼓舞我们前进的力量。在我们的万个“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体中，还有大家已经熟悉的徐学惠，为了保卫祖国的财产，顽强的、同六个持刀的匪徒搏斗，她就是活着的向秀丽。还有上海的裔式娟、山西的申纪兰、湖南的杨玉翠、河北的宋欣如、河南的文香兰、甘肃的樊秀才等，她们都是一贯坚决走社会主义道路，一贯在生产上带头，作出了出色成绩的鲜明的红旗。她们都是党和人民的好女儿，也是我们要不断向她们学习的好榜样。只要大家都具备她们这样的雄心壮志和崇高理想，我们就不论在什么时候，在什么地方，都能取得生产上、工作上的重大胜利。
    第二、热爱劳动，积极劳动，不讲条件，不计报酬，高度的共产主义劳动精神。
    从“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体的事例中，我们可以看出，她们个个都是为着改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，都是为着实现高速度建设社会主义，并准备向共产主义过渡的崇高的目的，因此她们能充分发扬了共产主义的劳动精神，不讲条件，不计报酬，苦干实干，分秒必争，自觉的英勇的劳动。像全国闻名的沈阳东北机器制造厂女工尉凤英，六年多来，她实现技术革新一百二十七项，不断提前超额完成任务，为国家创造了巨大的财富，现在她正在作1969年的活。她从不计较物质待遇和个人得失，只是一心为社会主义、共产主义。像藏族姐妹尼马布古在平叛斗争中，立场坚定，并且不辞辛苦，动员群众运送弹药支援平叛的解放军。还有像河南省治理鸠山的女英雄郭仙；牧业战线上的多面手蒙古族姑娘徐秀英；都是不为名、不为利，一心只为社会主义的红旗。为了社会主义建设，我们大家都要继续发扬这种共产主义劳动的精神，人人成为具有高度自觉的社会劳动者。
    第三、大兴共产主义协作之风，大公无私，集体为重，互相支援，照顾全局。
    社会主义事业，是集体的事业，一切工作都需要在党的领导下，依靠集体的力量，共同协作，彼此促进，互相提高，才能出色地完成任务。人与人、集体与集体之间，越能互相支援，力量就越大。互助友爱、大搞协作，是我国社会主义社会生产关系的一个光辉表现，是促进整个社会的生产水平提高的好方法。
    现在，把社会主义革命和建设的整体利益放在第一位，无私地支援别人，求得共同提高的共产主义风格，在我国人民和妇女中，已经大大发扬；无数舍己为公，先人后己，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的先进人物和事迹，到处涌现。像全国闻名的裔式娟小组，她们不仅本组团结得像一个人，而且和竞赛对手，互相学习，交流经验，一有新的创造，就主动互相传授，谁有技术难题，就大家设法解决。她们带动了全国纺织工人的竞赛运动，普遍地提高了技术水平。像全国闻名的植棉能手张秋香，无私地帮助竞赛对手克服困难，超过自己。她们都把帮助别人当作自己的义务和快乐，关心集体，大搞协作，照顾全局，从根本的、长远的利益出发，这是当前我国人民和妇女的新的道德品质，我们要使它不断地发扬光大。
    第四、发扬不断革命的精神，敢想敢干，不断前进。
    我们的雄心壮志是不但要建设社会主义，还要实现共产主义的伟大理想。因此，任何时候我们都不满足于已有的成就，要本着不断革命的精神，努力前进。在前进的道路上，总会遇到一些困难。但是有党和毛主席的领导，有广大群众无穷无尽的力量，任何困难，我们都能战胜它、克服它，继续前进。
    从我们的万个“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体中，就有说不尽的这样的人物和事例。像济南第二机床厂女车工曲淑姿，就是不畏艰苦、不怕困难、勇于革新、敢于创造的英雄。1959年8月她提前超额完成了第二个五年计划的工作量，产品质量达到百分之百，开始干1964年5月的活了。但她并未满足，在去年年底，试制成功螺丝帽套丝机，使原来的手工操作改成用机械操作，原来十四小时零四十分钟的活，现在只用八十分钟就做成了，而且质量更好；最近她又制成了一台自动冲螺杆机，能提高工效四百七十四倍，使原料利用率提高到百分之百，还节约了大量刀具和油料。她还立下雄心一定要在1960年把她所在的标准件工段的螺丝加工工序，全部改为自动化。她说：路是人走的，活是人干的，如果遇到困难就停下，什么时候才能到共产主义社会？这是多么豪迈的话，只有共产主义战士，才有这样英勇的气魄！还有像刚刚离开学校不久，就敢于猛攻技术尖端的西安的徐永基和采用土法上马、不断地进行科学研究的贵州郑兴珍，都对科学技术作出了出色的贡献。我们还非常高兴地看到像河南横水人民公社食堂主任韩兰英，四川的保育员蔡邦琼，山西省太阳村的幼儿园和托儿所，以及哈尔滨的纯化街服务站、北京的二龙路邻里服务所等，这些都是在组织集体生活方面贯彻不断革命精神的红旗手和红旗集体。她们处处从生产出发，事事为群众着想，千方百计地办好集体生活福利事业、办好社会服务事业；她们敢想敢干，大搞技术革新和技术革命，不断地提高劳动效率和服务质量。她们的辛勤劳动，不但切实地解决了妇女的家务孩子的牵累，而且进一步促进集体生产的发展，促进人们集体主义思想的提高，增进集体生活的幸福。她们从最具体的事实中看清了这些事业本身，就是整个生产事业中的一部分，生产和生活是相互促进的，这些看来都是平凡的劳动，却是整个社会主义建设中的一项崇高的事业；这些事业的举办、发展、巩固和提高，不是小事，而是大事；这些事业都具有无限广阔的发展前途。现在她们又以不断革命的精神，朝着全面组织群众集体生活的方向发展，进一步实现家务劳动社会化。我们大家一定要不断地发扬这种精神，进一步克服自卑，解放思想，使自己成为勇敢的、坚定的、具有革命胆略的不断革命的战士，为社会主义建设作出更多的新的贡献。
    第五、刻苦学习，不断提高政治、理论水平和文化、科学水平。
    许多姐妹，已经为我们树立了学习的好榜样，有不少工农劳动姐妹学习毛主席著作，学得很好，边学习，边实践，用到工作中，处理问题，提高了业务水平。像哈尔滨市售货员魏淑琴，她一年来学习了“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“历史唯物主义”等书，写了十几篇论文，当了理论学习讲习团的讲师；她还结合工作，研究出电动的试鞋器和电动拉门。她还主动和新同志签订师徒合同，包教包学。在学习文化方面，尤其是扫盲方面，在妇女中已经形成了一个新的高潮。山西万荣县王显公社青谷管理区扫盲先进集体，在几个月的时间内全部扫除了文盲，而且普遍进了业余学校，大攻科学技术堡垒，同时，还推广了普通话。还有像兰州市优秀小学教师李景兰，热爱儿童、热爱人民教育事业，她说：教育儿童，要有像战士攻堡垒的坚强信心，要有像园丁培植花草的耐心与细心。她刻苦钻研，积极提高教学质量。她所教班级的学生，优秀成绩占96％。在理论文化战线上的这么多新人新事，正是我国妇女浩浩荡荡向理论、科学、文化进军的表现。只要我们打破学习理论、文化、科学的神秘感，勤学勤练，我们就什么都可以学，什么都可以学得好。大家一定要早日实现毛主席指示的：“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”
    亲爱的姐妹们！“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体已经为我们树立了先进的榜样。我们要团结一心，积极学习她们的优良品质和先进经验。当选为“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体的姐妹们，更要充分发扬不断革命精神，永远朝气蓬勃，不断做出新成就，真正成为永不褪色的红旗；同时要继续密切联系群众，在群众中充分发挥骨干作用、桥梁作用、带头作用，更好地做到：“英雄左右皆好汉，先进周围一片红。”积极帮助周围伙伴，共同前进。
    当前我们国家形势好得很，我们要继续努力，夺取1960年的继续大跃进。我们妇女要更好地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，继续发挥冲天干劲，英勇劳动；积极参加技术革新和技术革命，不断地提高劳动生产率。当前最主要的是积极参加手工操作机械化、半机械化的全民运动，在各种生产劳动中，进一步发挥自己的积极作用。开动脑筋，钻研技术，作什么，改革什么，行行革新，事事革新，大胆创造，争取高速度实现手工操作机械化、半机械化。在现代化企业中要实现自动化、半自动化。在农业方面，要尽快的实现机械化、水利化、电气化。
    我们姐妹在积极参加社会劳动的同时，要注意身体的健康和安全，注意经期、孕期、产期、哺乳期的卫生。
    我们还要积极参加和大力办好集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，继续发展和办好公共食堂、哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园、服务站、缝纫组、妇产院和敬老院等等。从组织主要家务，向全面组织集体生活发展，进一步实现家务劳动社会化，把分散的、繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造成为集体的社会主义经济事业；逐步使集体生活成为社会主义社会的主要生活方式，以适应生产不断发展的需要和满足我们姐妹的迫切要求。
    我们还要继续有计划地努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作，不断的提高社会主义、共产主义觉悟。步步提高文化，努力学习科学知识，大胆进行科学研究，立志攀登文化科学高峰。
    为了在各种岗位上充分发挥我们姐妹们的作用，人人要立志成为红、勤、巧、俭的先进妇女，积极参加比、学、赶、帮的劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，要继续发扬不断革命的精神，先进的争取更先进，不骄不躁，努力不懈，边干边学，永远前进。后进的要加强信心，提高志气，苦钻苦学，力争变后进为先进。我们的社会主义建设正在不断跃进，我们大家都要鼓足干劲不断革命，永远前进。
    亲爱的姐妹们，让我们紧紧团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，快马再加鞭，跃进跃进再跃进，为实现1960年更好更全面的大跃进而奋勇前进。
