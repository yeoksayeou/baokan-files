    A New Type of Socialist Competition
    ——On the Korean "Chollima Workteam" Movement
    Ou Yuanfang, Cai Xiuben, Wang Yuzhang
    Amidst the high tide of socialist construction, Korean workers, building on the vigorous Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse) Campaign, have since March of last year launched a new type of socialist competition with even higher standards than the Chollima Campaign – the "Chollima Workteam" Movement. The central slogan of the movement is: "Work, live, and study in the spirit of communism." This movement not only greatly promotes production and accelerates the development of socialist construction, but also cultivates workers into new people with a high degree of communist consciousness and a high level of culture and technology.
    Although this movement has been underway in Korea for less than a year, 2,646 workteams, comprising more than 50,000 people, have already participated in the campaign to win the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam," and 174 workteams have already obtained this title. The conscious work attitude, the indomitable will to overcome difficulties, the spirit of diligent study, and the selfless and mutually supportive character of the "Chollima Workteam" comrades are deeply moving.
    A Communist Attitude Towards Labor
    Workers participating in the "Chollima Workteam" movement are rapidly establishing a communist attitude towards labor. For the sake of the motherland, the people, and socialism, they disregard compensation and are unafraid of difficulties and hardships, throwing themselves selflessly into labor.
    The Choi Yeon-ok "Chollima Workteam" of the Ciangwon Dokheung Mine, in order to create a multi-machine, multi-face mining method, gave the prepared faces to other workteams and went to open a new roadway 1,420 meters long. Initially, opening a new roadway meant less mining and lower wages (piece rate), and the working conditions were extremely difficult. However, they did not dwell on these things. Team leader Choi Yeon-ok took the lead, carrying a heavy rock drill, braving the torrential rain-like mountain water falling in the mine, and working hard day and night on steep slopes of seventy or eighty degrees, opening a new roadway. Subsequently, they used the multi-machine, multi-face mining method, creating an astonishing record of a tunneling team advancing 17.3 meters in eight hours. In the first nine months of last year, they tunneled 2,500 meters, equivalent to eleven times the annual plan.
    The Qiu Ming-fu "Chollima Workteam" of the Chongjin Artificial Fiber Factory, using their spare time, manufactured exhaust fans and blowers, removing carbon gas from the workshop, making the air clean and harmless, and benefiting everyone. They also taught themselves to repair machines, and all the machines in the workshop were inspected and repaired by themselves, freeing up repair workers to participate in labor elsewhere, saving labor for the country. They said, "As long as it benefits the country, we don't mind working harder ourselves."
    At the Hwanghae Iron Works, the tapping hole of a blast furnace once became clogged. At that time, the temperature inside the furnace was very high, and removing the blockage was an extremely difficult task. All sixteen workers of the Li Bing-jian "Chollima Workteam" competed to do it. Park Young-geum and seven other young workers said to the veteran workers: "You are older and more skilled, and injuries would affect production." To some of the younger workers, they said, "You are young and inexperienced and prone to danger." Then, they rushed to the tapping hole, braving the flames and high heat, and selflessly completed the task of clearing the blockage.
    In order to cultivate the communist spirit of the workers, the "Chollima Workteam" pays great attention to political and ideological education. For example, the Li Bing-jian workteam mentioned earlier strives to study party history and regularly conducts revolutionary tradition education. They also launched the "Red Notebook Movement," where everyone regularly records problems in their own ideology and work style in a "Red Notebook," records their own strengths and weaknesses, and then circulates them for collective discussion, engaging in criticism and self-criticism. In this way, they combine self-education with collective assistance, striving to make the entire team outstanding workers with a high degree of communist consciousness.
      Pioneers of the Technical Revolution
    The "Chollima Workteam," responding to the call of the Party, is doing an excellent job in implementing the technical revolution. They take the lead, open up paths, and lead everyone forward. The Zhao Ying-xie "Chollima Workteam" of the Heiling Coal Mine created a method of simultaneously extracting thick coal seams in their entirety, increasing labor productivity by more than seven times and saving a large amount of manpower and pit props. This creation was quickly推广 (extended, popularized) to seventeen coal mining sites, setting off a high tide of technical innovation throughout the mine. As a result, this coal mine overfulfilled its first Five-Year Plan by 40% two and a half years ahead of schedule in June of last year.
    The Zhu Cheng-yi "Chollima Workteam" of the Ryongsong Machinery Plant is a red banner in technological innovation. Zhu Cheng-yi created a lathe tool that can cut over 40 millimeters deep and 1.5 to 2 millimeters wide. The time required to cut a large shaft for a hydroelectric generator was reduced from 154 hours to 40 hours. The factory named this type of lathe tool the "Zhu Cheng-yi Lathe Tool."
    Korea's rapid steelmaking expert and old labor hero of the Songjin Steel Plant, Ahn Sang-jo, also leads his workteam in participating in the "Chollima Workteam" movement. They boldly adopted advanced steelmaking technologies such as continuous oxidation and air blowing, shortening the time for a ten-ton electric furnace to melt a furnace of steel from nine hours and five minutes to seven and a half hours.
    Mutual Assistance and Cooperation for Common Progress
    Since the launch of the "Chollima Workteam" movement, the style of mutual assistance, cooperation, and advanced units leading the less advanced to progress together has become a lofty virtue among Korean workers.
    The team leader of the Pyongyang Silk Reeling Factory's "Chollima Workteam," Ji Xue-shi, is a model of helping others. After leading her team to obtain the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam," this twenty-three-year-old girl voluntarily requested to work in a backward team that was unable to complete its production plan. When she arrived at this workteam with many new workers, she cared for and educated these new workers in all aspects, told them revolutionary stories, helped them wash clothes and tidy up their rooms, and taught them the method of operating with both hands. In this way, the workers in the team quickly united around Ji Xue-shi, and their skills also improved rapidly, completing the production plan every day.
    The Choi Rye-soon workteam of the Pyongyang Textile Factory is also a "Chollima Workteam" famous for helping others. They often take the initiative to send people to help relatively backward teams, and only after they have caught up with the advanced teams do they withdraw their own people and go to help another team. There are seven workteams in their workshop, and the Choi Rye-soon team always completes its quota early, but they do not immediately leave work. They always go to help other teams in different directions, and only after all seven teams have completed their quotas do they leave work together. When we visited this team, team leader Choi Rye-soon had already proposed to the factory that she hoped to be sent to a backward team to work.
    The Chen Ying-yuan workteam of the Gangseon Steel Plant, which first initiated the "Chollima Workteam" movement, is also a model of mutual assistance and cooperation. In steelmaking, charging materials is the most intense battle. After work every day, the Chen Ying-yuan workteam not only tidies up all the tools neatly, but also mobilizes all the members to help the next shift charge materials, so that the next furnace of steel can be smelted quickly and well. Now, every steelmaking workteam in the Gangseon Steel Plant has done this.
    Comprehensively improving technical and cultural levels is one of the important conditions for striving for the title of "Chollima Workteam." Each "Chollima Workteam" or workteam participating in the campaign to win this title uses methods of mutual assistance to launch a surge of learning technology and culture. For example, the Che Sun-hee "Chollima Workteam" of the Huichon Machine Tool Factory has a total of eleven people, with an average age of twenty-one and an average length of service of one year and eight months. In this workteam, some workers have a cultural level of junior high school or above, but their technical level is not high; other workers have a relatively high technical level, but their cultural level is very low. They pair workers with high technical skills and low cultural levels with those with high cultural levels and low technical skills, teaching and learning from each other, quickly improving the technical and cultural levels of the entire team. Before participating in the competition, the Li Bing-jian workteam of the Hwanghae Iron Works had two fourth-grade workers, seven fifth-grade workers, four sixth-grade workers, and three eighth-grade workers; after participating in the "Chollima Workteam" movement, within half a year, they became ten sixth-grade workers, three seventh-grade workers, and three eighth-grade workers. Their goal is to strive to enable everyone to reach the level of engineer or technician within four or five years. In order to improve their cultural level, all the workers in the team attend spare-time schools, two attend spare-time universities, three attend spare-time vocational schools, and the rest attend spare-time middle schools.
          Comprehensively Caring for People
      "Chollima Workteams" comprehensively care for everyone in the team. In addition to helping each other in politics, technology, and production, they also care for each other in life. In the Kim Eun-sil "Chollima Workteam" of the Pyongyang Textile Factory, 80% of the workers are war orphans who lost their parents in the war. They grew up in China and only returned to North Korea last year. Team leader Kim Eun-sil cares for these younger sisters like an older sister, arranging their time for political study and technical study, and also designating Friday as "Women's Day." On this day, after work, Kim Eun-sil teaches these younger sisters to knit sweaters, sew clothes, and embroider, making them feel the warmth of home. If anyone gets sick, everyone asks about their well-being and takes their place at work, ensuring that the attendance rate in the team reaches 100%. The whole team is like a family of sisters.
      "Chollima Workteams" also care about the families of the workers. There is a "Chollima Workteam" in the No. 2 Calcium Carbide Furnace of the Pukgung Chemical Factory. One of the slogans they put forward is: "Not only arm our own thoughts, but also arm the thoughts of our families." They often visit workers' families, carry out ideological work, and help each other solve difficulties. The children in the workers' residential area did not have a playground, so the "Chollima Workteam" workers used their spare time to build a children's park for them. When we visited the workers' dormitory at the Hwanghae Iron Works, we saw that the workers' dormitories were cleaned inside and out. The family members said: "We want to be a true family of a Chollima Workteam." They take good care of housework and actively take the lead in participating in street work.
        Lofty Honor
    This new type of competition, the "Chollima Workteam" movement, has now rapidly spread like wildfire to factories, mines, enterprises, and other departments in northern Korea. Not only workers, but also artists, shop assistants, and doctors... have all joined this movement. Not long ago, a sales team in the West Pyongyang Department Store won the title of "Chollima Sales Team." The obstetrics and gynecology department of the Pyongyang Red Cross Hospital has also received the title of "Chollima Department."
    Obtaining these titles is a lofty honor for the employees in Korea. However, striving for this honor is not an easy task. Because the "Chollima Workteam" movement is a high-level form of socialist labor competition in Korea, the competition conditions are more demanding than those of general labor competitions. The "Chollima Workteam" must first and foremost overfulfill the plan by item, specification, and by day, month, and quarter. This is the most basic. The competition conditions also include exemplary compliance with labor discipline, mutual assistance, learning culture and technology, and improving communist consciousness, etc. According to the general competition conditions, the workteams participating in the competition, combined with the situation of their own teams, formulate specific goals to strive for, register with the factory trade union committee, and formally participate. After the workteam has achieved the goals they have set in the competition, they must be reviewed and approved by the factory's employee congress, then submitted to the trade union committee of the province (equivalent to the provincial level in our country) for review and approval, and finally submitted to the Standing Committee of the National Federation of Trade Unions for review and approval, and officially granted the title of "Chollima Workteam." The review by the National Federation of Trade Unions is very strict. In late December 1959, 120 workteams participating in the competition submitted applications. After review by the Standing Committee of the National Federation of Trade Unions, only 89 were approved. One team had met all other conditions, but its attendance rate was only 97%, so it did not pass. According to regulations, the attendance rate must be at least 99% to be considered qualified. The National Federation of Trade Unions will award banners, badges, and red manuals to all workteams that have won this glorious title. The "Chollima Workteams" that we saw all hung banners in their workplaces, and the workers wore badges on their chests as a high honor.

    新型的社会主义竞赛
    ——记朝鲜的“千里马作业班”运动
    欧远方　蔡修本　王玉章
    在社会主义建设的高潮中，朝鲜工人在轰轰烈烈的千里马竞赛运动的基础上，从去年3月开始展开一种比千里马竞赛运动标准更高的新型的社会主义竞赛——“千里马作业班”运动。运动的中心口号是：“以共产主义的精神来工作、生活和学习。”这个运动不仅大大推动生产，加速社会主义建设的发展，而且把工人培养成有高度共产主义觉悟的，有高度文化、技术水平的新人。
    这个运动在朝鲜开展虽然还不到一年，但已有包括五万多人的二千六百四十六个作业班参加争取“千里马作业班”的光荣称号，并已有一百七十四个作业班获得了这个称号。“千里马作业班”工人同志们的自觉的劳动态度、战胜困难的顽强意志、努力学习的精神以及大公无私、团结互助的品德，是十分动人的。
    共产主义的劳动态度
    参加“千里马作业班”运动的工人，都迅速树立起共产主义的劳动态度。为了祖国、人民和社会主义，他们不计报酬、不怕艰难困苦，在劳动中忘我地冲锋陷阵。
    慈江道德兴矿山的崔莲玉“千里马作业班”，为了创造多机台多掌子面的采矿法，把已经开好的掌子面让给别的作业班，自己去开一条一千四百二十米长的新巷道。开新巷道起初采矿少，拿工资少（计件工资），而且劳动条件十分艰苦。但是，他们不计较这些。班长崔莲玉带头抱着沉重的凿岩机，冒着矿井中落下来的倾盆大雨般的山水，在七、八十度的陡坡上日夜苦干，开出了一条新巷道。接着，他们运用多机台多掌子面采掘法，创造了一个掘进小组在八小时内掘进十七点三米的惊人纪录。他们在去年头九个月就掘进了二千五百米，等于全年计划的十一倍。
    清津人造纤维工厂的秋明福“千里马作业班”，利用业余时间制造了排风器和搧风机，把车间内的碳瓦斯排出，使车间的空气清洁无害，为大家造福。他们还自己学会了检修机器，全车间的机器都自检自修，腾出了修理工到别处参加劳动，为国家节约劳动力。他们说：“只要对国家有利，我们自己多辛苦点没有什么。”
    在黄海制铁所，有一次高炉的出铁口发生块结。当时炉内的温度很高，去除块结是一件极艰苦的工作。李炳建“千里马作业班”十六个工人都争着去干。朴永金等七个青年工人向老工人们提出：“你们年纪大、技术高，受了伤会影响生产。”对一些年纪比较小的工人，他们说：“你们年纪轻、没有经验，容易发生危险。”接着，他们就抢先投向出铁口，冒着火焰和高热，奋不顾身地完成了清除块结的任务。
    为了培养工人同志的共产主义精神，“千里马作业班”十分注意政治思想教育。例如前面提到过的李炳建作业班，他们努力学习党史，经常进行革命传统教育。他们还开展“红本子运动”，每人都经常在“红本子”上记录自己的思想作风中的问题，记载自己的优缺点，然后互相传看，集体讨论，展开批评和自我批评，这样，把自我教育和集体帮助结合起来，努力使全班都成为具有高度共产主义觉悟的优秀工人。
      技术革命的先锋
    “千里马作业班”响应党的号召，在实行技术革命方面搞得很出色。他们打先锋、辟道路，带领大家前进。黑岭煤矿赵应燮“千里马作业班”创造了厚层煤全层同时采掘法，把劳动生产率提高了七倍以上，节约了大量的人力和坑木。这个创造很快就推广到十七个采煤场，在全矿掀起了一个革新技术的高潮。结果，这个煤矿在去年6月就提前二年半超额40％完成了第一个五年计划。
    龙城机械厂的朱成一“千里马作业班”，是革新技术的一面红旗。朱成一创造了一把车刀，能切削四十多毫米深、一点五到二毫米宽；切削一根水轮发电机大轴所费的时间，由一百五十四小时缩短到四十小时。工厂把这种车刀命名为“朱成一车刀”。
    朝鲜的快速炼钢名手、城津炼钢厂的老劳动英雄安相兆也率领着他的作业班参加“千里马作业班”运动。他们大胆采用了连续氧化法、空气吹入法等先进炼钢技术，使十吨电炉炼一炉钢的时间，由九小时零五分缩短到七小时半。
    互助协作共同前进
    自从“千里马作业班”运动开展以后，互助协作、先进带动落后共同前进的作风，已经成为朝鲜工人的一种崇高风尚。
    平壤缫丝厂“千里马作业班”班长吉学实是帮助别人的模范。这个二十三岁的姑娘在领导本班取得了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号以后，就自动要求到一个完不成生产计划的落后班去工作。她到了这个新工人很多的作业班，就从各方面关心、教育这些新工人，给她们讲革命故事，帮她们洗衣服、整理房间，把双手并用的操作法教给她们。这样，班内的工人很快就都团结在吉学实的周围，技术上也进步得很快，每天都完成了生产计划。
    平壤纺织厂的崔礼顺作业班也是一个帮助别人出名的“千里马作业班”。她们经常主动派人去帮助比较落后的班，等到它赶上了先进班以后，才抽回自己的人，再去帮助另一个班。她们所在的车间共有七个作业班，崔礼顺班每天都提早完成定额，但是她们并不马上下班，她们总是分头去帮助其他班，一定要等到七个班都完成了定额，才一起下班。我们去访问这个班的时候，班长崔礼顺同志已经向工厂提出，希望派她到一个落后班去工作。
    最先发起“千里马作业班”运动的降仙炼钢厂陈应源作业班也是互助协作的模范。在炼钢工作中，装料是一场最紧张的战斗。陈应源作业班每天下班以后，不仅把工具都收拾得齐齐整整，全班人马还一齐出动，帮助下一班装料，使下一炉钢炼得又快又好。现在，降仙炼钢厂的每个炼钢作业班都已经这样作了。
    全面提高技术水平和文化水平，是争取“千里马作业班”称号的重要条件之一。每个“千里马作业班”或参加争取这个称号的作业班，都用互相帮助的办法，展开学习技术、文化的热潮。例如，熙川机床厂车顺熙“千里马作业班”共有十一个人，平均年龄二十一岁，平均工龄一年零八个月。在这个作业班内，一部分工人有初中以上的文化水平，但技术水平都不高；另一部分工人技术水平比较高，但文化水平却很低。他们就把技术高、文化低，和文化
  高、技术低的工人配成对，互教互学，迅速提
  高了全班的技术、文化水平。黄海制铁所的李炳建作业班，在没有参加竞赛以前，全班有四级工二人，五级工七人，六级工四人，八级工三人；参加“千里马作业班”运动后，半年内变为六级工十人，七级工三人，八级工三人。他们的目标是，争取在四、五年内使每个人都达到工程师或技术员的水平。为了提高文化水平，全班工人都上业余学校学习，上业余大学的有二人，上业余专科学校的三人，其余都上了业余中学。
          全面关心人
      “千里马作业班”全面关心班内的每一个人。他们除了在政治、技术和生产等方面互相帮助之外，在生活上也互相关心。平壤纺织工厂的金恩实“千里马作业班”里，80％的工人是在战争中失去父母的战灾孤儿，她们在中国长大，去年才回到朝鲜。班长金恩实像姊姊一样关心这些小妹妹，替她们安排好政治学习和技术学习的时间，还把星期五定为“妇女日”。这一天，劳动完了以后，金恩实教这些小妹妹织毛线、缝衣服和刺绣，使她们感到家庭的温暖。有谁生了病，大家都来问寒问暖，并且替她上班，保证班内的出勤率达到百分之百。全班就像一个家庭的姊妹一样。
      “千里马作业班”对工人家属也很关心。本宫化学工厂二号电石炉有一个“千里马作业班”，他们所提出的口号中有这样一条：“不仅武装自己的思想，还要武装自己家属的思想”。他们经常访问工人家庭，进行思想工作，并且互相帮助解决困难。工人住宅区的儿童没有游戏场，“千里马作业班”工人就利用业余时间给他们修了一个儿童公园。我们访问黄海制铁所工人宿舍时，看到工人们的宿舍里里外外都打扫得干干净净。家属们说：“我们要做一个名副其实的千里马作业班家属”。她们把家务照料得很好，还积极带头参加街道工作。
        崇高的荣誉
    “千里马作业班”运动这个新型竞赛，目前已经像燎原之火一样，迅速燃地遍了朝鲜北部的厂矿、企业和其他部门。不仅是工人，艺术家、商店店员和医生……，都投入了这个运动。不久以前，西平壤百货店有一个售货小组，获得了“千里马售货小组”的称号。平壤市红十字医院的妇产科，也得到“千里马科”的称号。
    获得这些称号对朝鲜的职工们是一种崇高的荣誉。但是，争取这种荣誉并不是一件容易事。因为“千里马作业班”运动是朝鲜社会主义劳动竞赛的高级形式，竞赛条件比一般劳动竞赛要求高。“千里马作业班”首先必须出色地按项目、规格，按日、月和季度超额完成计划。这是最基本的。竞赛条件中还包括模范遵守劳动纪律、团结互助、学习文化技术、提高共产主义觉悟等等。参加竞赛的作业班根据总的竞赛条件，结合本班的情况，订出具体奋斗目标，向工厂职业同盟委员会登记，作为正式参加。作业班实现了自己在竞赛中提出的奋斗目标后，要由本厂的职工大会审查通过，然后提交道（相当于我国的省一级）的职业同盟委员会审查通过，最后提交全国职业总同盟常委会审查批准，正式给予“千里马作业班”的称号。职业总同盟的审查是很严格的。1959年12月下旬，有一百二十个参加竞赛的作业班提出申请，职业总同盟常委会审查后，只批准了八十九个。有一个班其他条件都已具备，就是出勤率只达到97％，没有通过。按规定，出勤率至少要达到99％才算合格。凡是获得这项光荣称号的作业班，职业总同盟就给它们颁发锦旗、证章和红色手册。我们所看到的“千里马作业班”，都把锦旗挂在自己工作的地方，工人把证章佩在胸前，作为一种很高的荣誉。
