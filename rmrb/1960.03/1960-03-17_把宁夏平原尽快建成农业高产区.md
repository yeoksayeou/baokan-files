    Build the Ningxia Plain into a High-Yield Agricultural Area as Quickly as Possible
    Hao Yushan, Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region

    The Ningxia Plain in the Yellow River irrigation area of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, known as "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," has 3.22 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for slightly more than 27% of the total sown area of ​​Ningxia. However, it bears more than 60% of the region's total grain production task. This irrigation area, with a long history, has suffered from soil salinization due to the lack of drainage facilities in the past, coupled with the primitive irrigation method of flooding for thousands of years. Before liberation, there was a folk song circulating here: "Mountain floods overflow, canal water inundates, the Yellow River backflows and drainage is difficult, fertile land turns into saline-alkali flats." After liberation, especially during the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of the entire region improved irrigation management and excavated drainage projects totaling 3,900 kilometers in length, with a total earthwork volume of 35 million cubic meters. Observation wells and saline-alkali land improvement experimental stations were also widely established. By the end of 1959, 2.23 million mu of the 3.22 million mu of farmland had drainage capacity, initially achieving simplified drainage ditch networks, improving saline soil, greatly reducing the degree of salinity, and more than doubling the cultivated area. The average yield per mu of grain increased from 250 jin in 1957 to over 400 jin in 1959.

    These facts fully demonstrate that in this large area of ​​saline-alkali land historically left over, as long as the soil is improved on a large scale and rapidly, the rapid development of agricultural production can be guaranteed. At present, although the improvement of soil in the Yellow River irrigation area of ​​our region has achieved great results, there are still more than 1 million mu of land in the existing cultivated land of the entire irrigation area that are severely saline, lacking seedlings, or even experiencing reduced production or crop failure, and 1.16 million mu of alkali wasteland and lakes that have not been transformed due to salinity, which need to be vigorously improved. The already improved saline-alkali land also needs to be further improved on the existing basis to ensure that the unit area yield of agriculture continues to rise. This is also the central task of water conservancy construction in the irrigation area at present. The Yellow River irrigation area will not only become an industrial base in our region in terms of development, but the objective situation also requires it to be a high-yield agricultural base. Because the high-speed development of industry and the rapid increase in urban population require better implementation of the policy of "planting more and harvesting more" and "high yield and more harvest," and turning this low-yield area into a high-yield area as soon as possible. The biggest obstacle to the development of agricultural production in this area is soil salinization. Therefore, quickly removing this obstacle is not only of great significance to industrial construction, but also of great political and economic significance to improving the economic level of the people's communes. Therefore, according to the plan, we must strive to eradicate the harm of soil salinization in the shortest possible time in order to achieve the goal of both expanding the planting area and rapidly increasing the unit area yield.

    Soil is the foundation of crops and also the foundation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In accordance with the spirit of the central government's instruction on improving soil salinization, "prevention first, combining prevention and treatment, taking water as the key link, and comprehensive management," soil improvement in our region must be based on water and soil, with equal emphasis on soil and fertilizer, and equal emphasis on drainage and irrigation. We must combine drainage ditch networks, large-system small-plot field management, salt washing and siltation, deep plowing, application of more organic fertilizer, and planting rice to fundamentally improve saline-alkali land. Among them, a fundamental and major measure we are taking is to simultaneously promote large-scale drainage ditch networks and large-system small-plot field management. This year, we will vigorously develop drainage ditch networks in the Yellow River irrigation area and large-system small-plot field management, complete drainage projects on more than 1 million mu of farmland, and complete 300,000 mu of salt washing and siltation projects to achieve the task of one mu of small-plot fields per person. Within two years, we will complete the improvement of 2 million mu of saline-alkali land and the task of small-plot field management on more than 3.2 million mu. In this way, grain output can be increased by at least several hundred million jin per year.

    Practice has proven that drainage ditch networks are an effective measure to improve soil salinization. Only by determining the drainage ditch network distance according to the soil conditions and the different conditions of surface waterlogging and groundwater level, and building drainage ditch networks, can surface waterlogging be eliminated and the groundwater level be lowered. Drainage is like the veins in the human body; large and small arteries are an organically connected whole. If the main ditches are excavated but the branch and capillary ditches are not excavated accordingly, they still cannot play an effective drainage role. The drainage ditch network is to build the main ditches and branch and capillary ditches into a network in a planned manner, becoming an overall drainage system. According to underground observation and drainage flow data, in recent years, due to the effect of drainage ditch networks, the degree of salinization in the Yellow River irrigation area has changed from "over-input" to "over-output." The amount of salt discharged has increased year by year, and the groundwater level has generally dropped by about one meter. This shows that drainage can not only discharge the salt in the Yellow River water, but also discharge the original salinity, gradually reducing the saline components in the soil. Therefore, we have unswervingly adopted the measure of drainage ditch networks to improve saline-alkali land, and we will complete the drainage ditch network as soon as possible according to the plan.

    Practice has proven that accelerating the realization of large-system small-plot field management is a fundamental measure to eliminate salinization in the Yellow River irrigation area and an effective method to better implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In particular, combining drainage ditch networks with small-plot field management can quickly eradicate the harm of salinization. Otherwise, draining on one side and importing a large amount on the other side will be difficult to eliminate the harm of salinity. Because small-plot field management can truly achieve the requirements of level ground like a mirror, straight ridges like lines, irrigation and drainage, and economical water use, it is also the key to implementing small-plot shallow irrigation and changing flood irrigation.

    The problem of water waste in the Yellow River irrigation area and the salinization caused by flood irrigation are serious. According to hydrological data from 1959, the Yellow River irrigation area receives 3.227 billion cubic meters of water annually. Among them, 1.049 billion cubic meters are discharged, and the return water reaches 32.5%. The original design drainage capacity of the first drainage ditch in the Hexi irrigation area was 20 cubic meters per second, but the actual drainage flow has reached 36 cubic meters per second. This kind of flood irrigation causes the groundwater level to rise, the degree of salinization to increase, and the drainage project to be difficult to maintain its proper role. Due to large plots and flood irrigation, the number of field corners and salt corners has increased year by year, generally accounting for about 5% to 10% of the actual harvested area. That is to say, the amount of crop harvest will also be reduced accordingly. In contrast, according to the experiment of Wang Taibao Agricultural Experimental Farm, in 1959, after changing 560 mu of wheat fields from 2 to 4 mu plots to 3 to 4 fen small plots, the water consumption per mu decreased from 430 cubic meters to about 200 cubic meters. The unit area yield increased from 492 jin in 1958 to 604 jin, an increase of 22.8%. Many other small-plot field management experiments in other areas have also proven that it is an effective measure to save water, reduce salinity, and increase yield. At the same time, it is expected that the area of ​​paddy fields in our region will expand to about 8 million mu in the next few years. Based on the runoff during the dry season of Qingtongxia and the current method of flood irrigation, it can only maintain more than 3 million mu of paddy fields. If large-system small-plot field management is realized in advance, and each cubic meter per second of water is used to irrigate 30,000 mu of land instead of 10,000 mu, the current dry season flow can also expand to irrigate 9 million mu of paddy fields. Therefore, it is necessary to unswervingly realize large-system small-plot field management, and strive to complete the task of 3.22 million mu of field management in two years, so as to eliminate saline soil and create good conditions for mechanization and high-yield base development.

    Improving soil and eliminating salinization is a process of growth of new things, and it will inevitably encounter many temporary difficulties. There will also be a new struggle between the old and the new, the advanced and the backward on the ideological front. In the past, some areas had the habit of flood irrigation, and more than 30% of the water in a canal flowed into the Yellow River, so the amount of water in the canal had to be increased by half, and the corresponding canal had to be increased by half, and the drainage ditch had to be increased by half. This requires us to make up our minds to dig into our thoughts and eliminate the "habit theory." As long as we reform the old habits, flood irrigation can be changed. Some people also say that rice cannot be grown in severely saline-alkali areas. After ideological revolution, not only can rice be grown, but also the yield is very high. Since this life can be reformed, the life of changing large plots to small plots can of course also be reformed. Some people say that changing large plots to small plots takes up a lot of land and requires a lot of labor. This is a wrong statement. According to the experiment of Lingwu Farm, a 2-mu plot of land cost 18 workdays; after becoming a small plot, the use of a ridge-building machine only took two or three workdays. This is a good proof. As for some people saying that small-plot field management will reduce the land area, this is even more inconsistent with the actual situation. Engaging in small-plot field management will not only not reduce the land area, but will also increase the land area. In fact, the horizontal soft ridges of small-plot field management are basically also planting areas, which are also conducive to ventilation and light to ensure a bumper harvest. Therefore, as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, hold high the red flag of the general line, adhere to the mass line, vigorously launch mass movements, and vigorously launch high-efficiency movements centered on tool reform, we will be able to overcome various ideological obstacles and complete this glorious task in the shortest possible time, thereby making our region a high-yield area from a low-yield area and laying a good foundation for continued leaps forward.

    把宁夏平原尽快建成农业高产区
    宁夏回族自治区副主席　郝玉山
    宁夏回族自治区黄河灌区的宁夏平原，素称“塞上江南”，这里有耕地三百二十二万亩，约占宁夏全部实种面积27％强，但它却担负着全区60％以上的粮食生产任务。这个具有悠久历史的灌区，由于过去没有排水设施，加上千年来采用大水漫灌的原始灌溉方法，造成了土壤盐渍化。解放前，这里流传着这样一首民谣：“山洪漫，渠水淹，黄河倒灌排水难，良田变成盐碱滩”。解放后，尤其在1958年和1959年的连续大跃进中，全区人民在党的正确领导下，经过改善灌溉管理，开挖了长达三千九百公里的排水工程，其工程量仅土方一项就达三千五百万方。并普遍地建立了观测井、盐碱地改良试验站。截至1959年底，在三百二十二万亩农田中，有排水能力的已达二百二十三万亩，初步实现了排水简易沟网化，改良了盐渍地，盐渍程度大大降低，耕地面积扩大了一倍多，粮食平均亩产量由1957年的二百五十斤提高到1959年的四百斤以上。
    这些事实充分说明，在这个历史上遗留下来的大面积盐渍化地区，只要大规模地迅速地改良土壤，就可以保证农业生产迅速发展。目前我区引黄灌区土壤改良虽然获得了巨大成绩，但是全灌区现有的耕地中，还有盐渍严重，缺苗甚至减产、失种的地一百余万亩，有因盐渍而没有改造的碱荒、湖泊等一百一十六万亩，需要大力改良。已经改良过的盐碱地，也还需在现有的基础上进一步提高，保证农业单位面积产量不断上升。这也是灌区内当前兴修水利的中心任务。引黄灌区在发展上不仅将成为我区工业基地，而且客观形势要求也必将是一高产的农业基地。因为工业的高速度发展和城市人口的迅速增加，就要求更好地贯彻多种多收与高产多收的方针，尽快地把这个低产区变为高产区。而发展农业生产在这个地区存在的最大的绊脚石就是土壤盐渍化，因此迅速搬掉这块绊脚石，不仅对工业建设有重要意义，对提高人民公社的经济水平，也有重大的政治意义和经济意义。因此，根据规划，我们必须争取在最短时期内根除土壤盐渍化的危害，以达到既扩大种植面积，又迅速提高单位面积产量的目的。
    土是农作物的基础，也是农业“八字宪法”的基础。按照中央指示的改良土壤盐渍化“以防为主，防治并重，以水为纲，综合治理”方针的精神，我区改良土壤必须以水土为主，土肥并重，排灌并重；并把排水沟网化、大系小畦园田化、洗盐淤田、深耕、多施有机肥料、种植水稻等措施结合起来，从根本上改良盐碱地。其中，我们采取的一项根本的主要措施，就是大搞排水沟网化和大系小畦园田化同时并举。今年要大搞引黄灌区排水沟网化，大系小畦园田化，完成一百余万亩农田的排水工程，三十万亩洗盐淤田工程，实现每人一亩小畦园田化的任务。并在两年内，完成二百万亩盐碱地的改良和三百二十多万亩小畦园田化的任务。这样，每年至少可增产粮食几亿斤以上。
    实践证明：排水沟网化是改良土壤盐碱化的有效措施。只有把排水干沟和排水支沟按照土壤情况及地上渍水、地下水位的不同情况，拟定排水沟网距离，建成排水沟网化，才能排除地面渍水和降低地下水位。排水就像人体中的脉络一样，大小动脉是有机联系的整体。如果大干沟开挖了，而不相应地开挖支毛沟，仍然不能发挥有效的排水作用。排水沟网化就是要把大干沟和支毛沟有计划地建成网状，成为一个整体的排水系统。根据地下观测和排水流量资料记载，引黄灌区近几年来，由于排水沟网化的作用，盐渍化程度已由“入超”变为“出超”，排出的盐量逐年增多，地下水位普遍降低一米左右。这说明，排水不仅可以把黄河水中的盐排出去，还可把原来的盐渍排掉，使土壤中盐渍成分逐步减少。因此，我们坚定不移地采取了排水沟网化的改良盐碱地的措施，按照规划，尽快地实现排水沟网化。
    实践证明：加速实现大系小畦园田化，是消灭引黄灌区盐渍化的治本措施，也是更好地贯彻农业“八字宪法”的一项有效的方法。特别是把排水沟网化和小畦园田化结合起来，就可迅速根治盐渍化的危害。否则，一面排出，一面大量输入，是难以消灭盐碱危害的。因为小畦园田化真正能达到地平如镜，埂直如线，有灌有排和经济用水的要求，也是实行小畦浅灌、改变大水漫灌的关键。
    引黄灌区浪费水的问题和大水漫灌形成的盐渍化是严重的。根据1959年水文资料记载：引黄灌区每年进水三十二亿二千七百万立方米。其中排出的就有十亿四千九百万立方米，回归水竟达32．5％；河西灌区第一排水沟原设计排水能力为二十秒公方的流量，实际排水流量已达三十六秒公方。这种大水漫灌，造成地下水位上升、盐渍化程度增加和排水工程难以维持它应有的作用。由于大畦大水漫灌，使田嘴子、盐嘴子逐年增加，一般要占实际收获面积5％到10％左右。那就是说，农作物收获量也要相应的减少。与此相反，据王太堡农业试验场的试验，1959年把五百六十亩小麦田，由二至四亩的田块改成三至四分小畦后，每亩用水由四百三十立方米降到二百立方米左右；单位面积产量由1958年的四百九十二斤，提高到六百零四斤，增产22．8％。其它地区许多小畦园田化的试验也都证明，它是节约用水、减少盐渍、提高产量的有效措施。同时，预计在最近几年内，我区水田面积将要扩大到八百万亩左右，依据青铜峡枯水期的径流量和现在的大水漫灌办法，仅能维持三百余万亩水田。如提前实现大系小畦园田化，每秒公方水由灌溉万亩地提高灌溉三万亩地的话，目前的枯水流量也能扩灌九百万亩水田。因此，要坚定不移地实现大系小畦园田化，力争两年完成三百二十二万亩园田化的任务，为消灭盐渍地，给机械化和高产基地化创造良好条件。
    改良土壤，消灭盐渍化是新生事物成长的过程，必然会遇到许许多多的、暂时性的困难。在思想战线上也将会有一场新的和旧的、先进的和落后的斗争。过去有些地区有大水漫灌的习惯，一条渠道的水有30％多流入黄河，这样渠道水量要增加一半，相应的渠道也要增加一半，排水沟也要增加一半。这就必须下决心挖思想，破除“习惯论”；只要革掉旧习惯的命，大水漫灌是可以改变的。也有人说，重盐碱地区不能种水稻，经过思想革命以后，不但能种水稻，而且产量很高。这个命既然能革，大畦变小畦的命当然也能革。有人说大畦变小畦占地多，费工大。这是一种错误的说法。据灵武农场试验，一块二亩大的田块，费十八个工；变成小畦以后，采用了筑埂器，只花两三个工。这就是一个很好的证明。至于有人说小畦园田化会使土地面积减少，这更不符合实际情况。搞小畦园田化，不但不会减少土地面积，而且会增加土地面积。实际上，小畦园田化的横软埂，基本上也是种植面积，也利于通风光保丰收。因此，只要坚持政治挂帅，高举总路线的红旗，坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，大搞以工具改革为中心的高工效运动，就一定能够克服各种思想障碍，在最短时间内完成这一光荣任务，从而使我区由低产地区变为高产地区，为继续跃进打下良好基础。
