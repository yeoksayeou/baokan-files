Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: San José dispatch: The people of Costa Rica held a rally on the evening of the 21st in the Latin Theater in the capital, San José, attended by approximately three thousand people, to support the Cuban Revolution and strongly protest the aggression of U.S. imperialism against the Cuban people. This mass rally was organized by the Costa Rican Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution, whose members are workers, students, and intellectuals from various political parties. Cuban Ambassador Juan José Fusa attended the rally. The organizers of the meeting, parliamentarians Palina Marcial Aguiluz and Rafael Cordero Croceri, as well as Fermín Alvarado, a representative of the youth organization of the National Republican Party, also participated. Outside the venue, approximately three thousand more people were unable to enter because the theater was filled with enthusiastic participants.

The rally decided to begin registering volunteers in Costa Rica who are willing to fight to defend Cuban sovereignty, in order to participate in the fighting in the event of an imperialist armed invasion of Cuba. In his speech, parliamentarian Aguiluz affirmed: The revolution of the entire Latin America has begun, and Latin America is determined to defend its sovereignty, independence, and the supreme interests of its people. The U.S. State Department should be clear that we are a people who demand respect for our free will. If Cuba is attacked, all of Latin America will go to defend Cuba.

Parliamentarian Cordero Croceri said that the world has changed, and U.S. imperialism is no longer the master who can impose its barbaric policies on underdeveloped countries. Imperialism cannot divide us. They can only make us more united so that when the time comes, we can take up arms to defend Cuba, making it inviolable. The path taken by the Cuban people in the revolution is also the path that the people of other countries in Latin America should and can take.

Fermín Alvarado, the representative of the youth organization of the National Republican Party, said that if imperialism attacks the Cuban people, university students are determined to take up arms and stand with Castro.

A leader of the Nicaraguan Revolutionary Youth Organization who attended the rally warned that whoever touches Cuba, the countries of Latin America will raise their iron fists against the imperialist aggressors.

At the rally, representatives of Costa Rican trade union organizations presented a Costa Rican flag to the Cuban ambassador, expressing the fraternal friendship between the workers of the two countries. In his reply speech, Cuban Ambassador Fusa said, I feel that the people of Costa Rica are great allies of the Cuban people and the Cuban Revolution. He said that the Cuban Revolution will never retreat in the face of aggression from “merchants who trade in the blood and sweat of others.” The rally screened news films about the first anniversary of the Cuban revolutionary government and the explosion of the "La Coubre" ship.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 22nd: On the twenty-third anniversary of the Ramos Sunday Massacre, when U.S. soldiers opened fire on a demonstration of Puerto Rican patriots in Ponce, people from all walks of life in Havana held a tribute to Puerto Rico on the evening of the 21st. This was part of the activities of the Week of Support for the Latin American Peoples.

Excited Cuban workers, militiamen, students, and women participating in the rally expressed their warm support for Puerto Rico's struggle to break free from U.S. rule and achieve independence. They repeatedly stood up and cheered the name of Alvizu Campos, the famous Puerto Rican patriot imprisoned by the United States, demanding his immediate release by the U.S. authorities.

Juan Huarbe, the Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, spoke, condemning the United States for its military occupation of Puerto Rico against the will of the Puerto Rican people, turning Puerto Rico into a barracks for waging aggressive wars. He said that every square meter of land is covered with weapons. He revealed that there is a nuclear warhead missile base and an atomic bomber base in Puerto Rico, both of which store nuclear bombs. The entire island of Puerto Rico is covered with sea, land, and air military bases and military training camps, and recently, an exercise involving 20,000 U.S. Marines is being held in a training camp. He said that despite the constant suppression of patriots, Puerto Rico will inevitably break free from the colonial shackles of the United States and gain liberation.

Leslie Rodriguez, the leader of the Cuban National Association of Normal School Teachers, said that the Cuban people support Puerto Rico, which is suffering from U.S. colonial enslavement, in its struggle for political independence and economic liberation.

The famous Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén recited his poems exposing the false essence of the so-called "Free Associated State" imposed on Puerto Rico by the United States and opposing U.S. racial discrimination. His recitation was warmly welcomed.

    据新华社23日讯　圣约瑟消息：哥斯达黎加人民21日晚在首都圣约瑟的拉丁剧院举行了一次约有三千人参加的大会，支持古巴革命和强烈抗议美帝国主义对古巴人民的侵略。这次群众大会是由哥斯达黎加的古巴革命之友协会组织的，这个协会的成员是各政党的工人、学生和知识分子。古巴大使胡安·何塞·富萨出席了大会。会议的组织者和议员帕利纳·马西亚尔·阿吉卢斯和拉斐尔·科尔德罗·克罗塞里以及民族共和党青年组织的代表费尔明·阿耳瓦拉多都参加了大会。在会场外面，还有大约三千人由于剧院被热情的参加者挤满而不能进去。
    大会决定开始在哥斯达黎加登记愿为保卫古巴主权而战的志愿者，以便在帝国主义武装侵略古巴时参加战斗。议员阿吉卢斯在他的发言中肯定说：全拉丁美洲的革命已经开始，拉丁美洲决心保卫主权、独立和它的人民的最高利益。美国国务院应该清楚，我们是要求尊重我们的自由意志的人民。如果古巴遭到了侵略，全拉丁美洲都将去保卫古巴。
    议员科尔德罗·克罗塞里说，世界已经变了，美帝国主义已经不再是可以把它的野蛮政策强加于不发达国家的主人了。帝国主义不能分裂我们。他们只能使我们更加团结起来，以便当时间到来时拿起武器保卫古巴，使它不受侵犯。古巴人民在革命中所走的道路也是我们拉丁美洲其他各国人民应该而且能够走的道路。
    民族共和党青年组织的代表费尔明·阿耳瓦拉多说，如果帝国主义进攻古巴人民的话，大学生决心拿起武器，和卡斯特罗站在一边。
    参加大会的尼加拉瓜革命青年组织领导人警告说，谁要碰一碰古巴，拉丁美洲各国就将举起反对帝国主义侵略者的铁拳。
    会上，哥斯达黎加工会组织的代表把一面哥斯达黎加国旗献给了古巴大使，表示两国工人间的兄弟友谊。古巴大使富萨在致答词时说，我感到哥斯达黎加人民是古巴人民和古巴革命的伟大盟友。他说，古巴革命永远也不会在“以别人血汗来做买卖的商人”的侵略面前退却。大会放映了关于古巴革命政府一周年和“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸的新闻电影。
    据新华社哈瓦那22日电　在美国士兵向蓬塞的波多黎各爱国者的示威游行开枪扫射造成拉莫斯星期日大屠杀的二十三周年的时候，哈瓦那各界人民在21日晚间举行了向波多黎各致敬的大会。这是支援拉丁美洲人民周的活动的一部分。
    参加大会的兴奋的古巴劳动者、民兵、学生和妇女表示热烈支持波多黎各争取摆脱美国统治以取得独立的斗争，他们好几次起立欢呼被美国监禁的波多黎各著名爱国者阿耳维苏·坎波斯的名字，要求美国当局立即释放他。
    波多黎各国民党对外关系书记胡安·胡亚尔贝发言谴责美国违反波多黎各人民的意志对波多黎各实行军事占领，把波多黎各变成进行侵略战争的兵营。他说，每平方米的土地上都满布着武器。他揭露，波多黎各境内有一个核弹头导弹基地和一个原子轰炸机基地，这两个基地都贮存有核炸弹。整个波多黎各岛遍布着海、陆、空军事基地和军事训练营地，最近正在一个训练营地举行两万美国海军陆战队的演习。他说，尽管对爱国者不断地进行镇压，波多黎各必将摆脱美国的殖民桎梏而获得解放。
    古巴全国师范教师协会领导人莱斯列·罗德里格斯说，古巴人民支持遭受美国殖民奴役的波多黎各争取政治独立和经济解放的斗争。
    古巴著名诗人尼古拉斯·纪廉朗诵了他揭露美国强加于波多黎各的所谓“自由联邦州”的虚伪实质和反对美国种族歧视的诗篇，他的朗诵受到了热烈的欢迎。
