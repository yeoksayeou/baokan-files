    Man Makes Rain When Heaven Doesn't
    Bumper Harvest Depends on Man, Not Heaven
    Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Guangdong Launch Massive Drought Resistance Campaigns
    Henan
    Large Numbers of Cadres and Workers Go to the Front Lines; Nearly Ten Million Commune Members are Full of Fighting Spirit
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 4th: Henan Province's massive drought resistance and spring irrigation campaign is rapidly advancing. The broad masses of people's commune members are determined to overcome the spring drought and strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year and timely planting of spring crops. Currently, the number of commune members participating in the drought resistance struggle has increased to more than 9.5 million, and the use of various water sources for drought resistance and spring irrigation has also nearly doubled compared to mid-February. By the end of February, the province had irrigated more than 50 million mu of wheat with reviving water, of which more than 10 million mu had been irrigated more than twice, and 45 million mu of wheat fields had been cultivated, and 60 million mu had been fertilized. While irrigating wheat with reviving water, various localities are also seizing the opportunity to vigorously carry out spring plowing and spring irrigation. The province has already plowed 25 million mu of land, irrigated 10 million mu with bottom moisture, and applied 22 million mu with base fertilizer.
      "Taking the victory over the spring drought and striving for a bumper summer wheat harvest as the overriding central task at present," is the call issued by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the people of the province. The broad masses of cadres and people in various localities actively responded to the call of the Provincial Committee, and the drought resistance and wheat irrigation activities quickly entered a climax. More than 100,000 cadres and 60,000 technical workers in the province have gone deep into the drought resistance front lines to lead the drought resistance struggle and repair drought resistance tools in a timely manner. Various factories have also made manufacturing drainage and irrigation machinery and supporting drought resistance their main production task at present. Relevant departments are giving priority to drought resistance work. In the drought resistance struggle, various localities have particularly strengthened their leadership over mountainous areas, sandy lands, and hilly areas with scarce water sources, mobilizing commune members to find water sources in every possible way to eliminate spring irrigation dead ends. Xinxiang Prefecture organized a 10,000-person wheat field management promotion group to focus on areas with difficult water sources such as high mountains, hills, and beaches, and adopted methods such as digging wells to find springs, opening mountain springs, and diverting water uphill to develop water sources, so that 1.84 million mu of the district's 2.75 million mu of wheat fields with poor water conservancy conditions were irrigated with reviving water in a timely manner. Due to the lack of water sources in Hulonggang, Junxian County, wheat fields were rarely irrigated in the past. This year, the people's communes on the hill adopted methods such as shallow wells to find springs, digging wells at the foot of the hill, pumping water to the hill, and diverting water through pipes across ditches to turn Hulonggang into a water-rich area. More than 20,000 mu of wheat on the hill have been irrigated with reviving water in a timely manner. Vigorously digging mechanized wells and making full use of groundwater is an important measure taken by various localities to overcome drought. The province has invested 660,000 laborers in digging mechanized wells. By the end of February, more than 20,000 new mechanized wells had been completed, and more than 17,000 were under construction. At present, the high tide of mechanized well digging has not only formed in the plains but is also developing towards the hilly areas.
    Various localities are also focusing on water conservancy projects and matching machinery to increase drought resistance and wheat irrigation capabilities. According to statistics from Nanyang and Luoyang Prefectures and Zhengzhou City, 575 newly built reservoirs have achieved reservoir completion and channel opening, and more than 160,000 large and small channels have been excavated and renovated, and more than 28,000 mechanized wells have been equipped with water lifting tools.
    Shaanxi
    Major Inspection Promotes Drought Resistance Struggle; Five Thousand Technical Workers Go to the Countryside to Provide Support
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 4th: Commune members in various parts of Shaanxi Province are vigorously fighting drought and strengthening preparations for spring planting. As of March 2, the province had irrigated more than 26.8 million mu of overwintering crops and fallow land, and carried out timely spring plowing, land preparation, and moisture conservation. Yulin and Hanzhong Prefectures have harrowed and conserved moisture on more than 3.267 million mu, and in the Guanzhong area, the high-yield cotton fields, which account for nearly half of the total cotton field area, have generally achieved deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, moisture conservation, loose top and firm bottom, no caking, and no cracks. Moisture-preserving sowing has gradually unfolded from south to north. As of February 26, the three prefectures in southern Shaanxi had planted more than 1.3 million mu of potatoes, the two prefectures in northern Shaanxi had planted 120,000 mu of spring peas and spring wheat, and the two cities of Xi'an and Xianyang and the three prefectures in southern Shaanxi had also planted 320,000 mu of spring vegetables.
    Since the beginning of spring, Shaanxi Province has not experienced any significant rainfall, and the drought situation continues to develop. In order to push the drought resistance struggle to a higher level, all secretaries of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, except those who were out of town on official business, went deep into various parts of the province to inspect and promote drought resistance work. The provincial government dispatched more than 2,000 cadres to the countryside to fight drought with the masses, and transferred more than 5,000 technical workers from cities such as Xi'an to rural areas to inspect and repair drainage and irrigation machinery and agricultural tools. Party committees at all levels have also vigorously strengthened drought resistance leadership and launched mass drought resistance and spring preparation campaigns through major inspections, major evaluations, and organized visits. Hanzhong and Ankang Prefectures organized inspection groups of thousands and tens of thousands of people to inspect and evaluate drought resistance work in communes and teams.
    In the fight against drought and the protection of spring planting, various localities, in addition to vigorously carrying out water conservancy finishing projects, have also launched large-scale well-digging activities. In Bin County alone, more than 5,500 wells were dug in 20 days, exceeding the original plan by tenfold. Production and supply units of various drainage and irrigation machinery have also launched major cooperation and decided to manufacture and repair all the drainage and irrigation machinery and waterwheels lacking in various places in the near future. Various factories are also rushing to produce water lifting tools, striving to get them out of the factory ahead of schedule for matching supply.
    While ensuring irrigation of summer fields, various localities are trying to expand the irrigation area of autumn fields as much as possible, especially prioritizing the irrigation of fields that are about to be sown. In the Wenquan River Irrigation Area of Tongchuan City, after implementing the quota-based water use method, large amounts of water are used in zones, small amounts of water are used centrally; water is used dispersedly at night and centrally during the day; channel water is used to irrigate long ridges and distant lands, well water is used to irrigate small ridges and nearby lands; uneven land is irrigated during the day, and flat land is irrigated at night; wheat fields are irrigated first, followed by fallow land; high land is irrigated first, followed by low-lying land; and sunny slopes are irrigated first, followed by shady slopes. As a result, the area irrigated per cubic meter of water per second has increased from 670 mu to 2,342 mu. The Shuangwang Management Area of Chengguan Commune in Weinan County has adopted a method of rational water distribution between summer and autumn fields, so that all wheat and cotton fields can be irrigated in a timely manner.
    Shanxi
    Fight Drought When There Is Drought, Prevent Drought When There Is No Drought; Increase Sources of Water, Reduce Waste, and Return Every Drop to the Field
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 4th: Shanxi Province's drought resistance and prevention campaign, centered on vigorously developing water conservancy, is gaining momentum. Under the slogan of "Man Makes Rain When Heaven Doesn't," more than 3 million people in the province have invested in the struggle to rush to build water conservancy projects and spring irrigation. Since the beginning of spring, the irrigated area expanded and improved in various localities has reached more than 8 million mu, and more than 60,000 horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery have been put into irrigation. The province has already spring-irrigated 4 million mu of cultivated land, greatly exceeding the progress of the same period in previous years.
    Since last winter, there has been little rain and snow in Shanxi Province. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of commune members in the people's communes in various localities, based on the spirit of fighting drought when there is drought and preventing drought when there is no drought, have exerted soaring energy, trying every possible means to increase sources of water, reduce waste, and strive to return every drop to the field. Under the slogan of "Ensuring a Bumper Harvest in Wheat Fields Without Rain, and Ensuring Full Seedlings in Autumn Fields Without Rain," Jin Southeast Prefecture has invested 300,000 people in the campaign to match thousands of reservoirs with ten thousand channels. Jinzhong Prefecture promoted the power-driven well-digging machine successfully created by Taigu County, and now more than 10,000 wells of various types have been completed, and more than 6,000 are under construction. The characteristics of water conservancy construction in northern Shanxi are focusing on the "three highs" competition of high speed, high work efficiency, and high quality. Now, an average of more than 200 water conservancy projects are completed every day, giving play to benefits in a timely manner. The district has newly added more than 1,100 reservoirs and ponds alone.
    New situations have also emerged in the rational water use activities in various localities. Huofen County has focused on rational water use and water conservation, so that the county's water utilization rate has increased by 63% compared to the past, and the irrigated area has expanded by 57%. The average area irrigated per day and night with 1.3 flows of water in the county has increased from 950 mu in the past to 2,200 mu. Each flow irrigates an average of 76,000 mu. Houma City's Quwo, Qucun, and other communes have successfully trial-produced artificial rainmaking vehicles and have begun installing underground pipelines and testing underground irrigation in high-yield fields. After seeing these projects, commune members praised, "Man makes rain when heaven doesn't, and a bumper harvest depends on man, not heaven."
    In order to fully support the drought resistance and prevention struggle, the province's industrial and commercial departments are carrying out activities to "do a good deed for agriculture." Factories above the county level in Jinan Prefecture have also dispatched more than 2,100 technical workers to form drainage and irrigation machinery repair teams, carrying tools and spare parts deep into the fields for mobile inspection and repair.
    Guangdong
    Blocking Rivers to Divert Water for Irrigation; Early Rice Planting Basically Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 4th: The people of Guangdong Province, with the heroic spirit of "man will conquer nature," have launched a high tide of water storage and conservation and water saving to prevent and resist drought. From the end of February, in just over ten days, all rivers, large and small, except the Xijiang River, were completely blocked to divert water for irrigation. The matching work of water conservancy projects is also being accelerated with concentrated efforts. At present, the early rice planting work in the province has been basically completed, and more than 17.2 million mu of spring-planted miscellaneous grains and cash crops have been planted. The province's more than 5.1 million drought resistance troops are trying every possible means to lift and divert water day and night to irrigate the fields, preparing for rice transplanting. Hainan Island, which has an earlier season, has transplanted more than 2.18 million mu of early rice.
    The rainfall in Guangdong Province this winter and spring has been greatly reduced compared to previous years. Last month, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions calling on the entire party and the entire people to mobilize urgently to comprehensively prevent and resist drought, ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing and spring planting, and ensure a bumper early harvest. Party committees at all levels have also made drought resistance, rush planting, and rush sowing the overriding central task at present.
    Since Guangdong Province has many rivers, all localities have closely grasped the blocking of rivers as the center in the mass movement of storing, conserving, and saving water. Now the province has completed more than 126,000 blocking river projects. Except for the Xijiang River, all usable rivers have been completely blocked or are being blocked. After successfully completing the blockade of the Han River on February 25, the people's communes in the Chaoshan Plain enabled 1.2 million mu of farmland to obtain irrigation. Then, they began the pioneering work of "diverting Han to relieve Rong," splitting mountains and opening canals, diverting the water of the Han River to the Rong River through a 19.5-kilometer canal, and then blocking the Rong River to irrigate more than 120,000 mu of drought-stricken farmland on both sides. This project also fully started on February 26. According to the current extremely incomplete statistics, the irrigated area expanded through blocking rivers in the province has reached several million mu. While vigorously carrying out blocking rivers, the original water conservancy army concentrated its efforts to vigorously grasp project matching, striving for the projects completed this spring to catch up with the needs of spring plowing water as early as possible. In addition, various localities have also dug 61,770 wells and springs, and repaired more than 190,000 dikes and ditches according to different characteristics.

    新华社郑州4日电　河南省声势浩大的抗旱春浇运动正在迅速地向前发展。广大人民公社社员决心战胜春旱，力争今年小麦大丰收和适时种好春播作物。目前，全省参加抗旱斗争的社员已经增加到九百五十多万人，利用抗旱春浇的各种水源，也比2月中旬增加了将近一倍。到2月底为止，全省已浇小麦返青水五千多万亩，其中有一千多万亩浇了两遍以上，有四千五百多万亩麦田经过中耕，六千万亩施了返青肥。在大浇小麦返青水的同时，各地还抓紧时机大力春耕春浇，全省已春耕地两千五百万亩，春浇底墒水一千多万亩，施底肥两千二百万亩。
      “把战胜春旱争取夏季小麦大丰收，作为当前压倒一切的中心工作”，是中共河南省委向全省人民发出的号召。各地广大干部、群众积极响应省委号召，使抗旱浇麦活动迅速进入高潮。全省有十万多名干部和六万多名技术工人深入抗旱前线，领导抗旱斗争和及时修理抗旱工具；各个工厂也把制造排灌机械、支援抗旱作为当前主要生产任务，各有关部门对于抗旱工作都先办快办。在抗旱斗争中，各地特别加强了对水源缺乏的山区、沙地和丘陵地区的领导，动员社员千方百计大找水源，消灭春浇死角。新乡专区组织了麦田管理万人促进团，大抓高山、丘陵、滩地等水源困难地区，采取了打井下泉、开山泉、引水上山等办法开发水源，使全区二百七十五万多亩水利条件不好的麦田，有一百八十四万亩已及时浇了返青水。浚县火龙岗由于缺乏水源，过去麦田很少春浇，今年岗上的人民公社采取浅井下泉、岗下打井、抽水上岗和隔沟架水管引水等办法，把火龙岗变成了水龙岗，全岗已及时浇灌小麦返青水两万多亩。大打机井，充分利用地下水，是各地战胜干旱所采取的一项重要措施。全省投入打机井的劳力已达六十六万人。到2月底为止，已打成新机井两万多眼，正在施工的还有一万七千多眼。目前，打机井高潮不但在平原地区形成，还在向丘陵地区发展。
    各地还大抓水利工程和机具配套工作，增加抗旱浇麦力量。据南阳、洛阳两个专区和郑州市的统计，已有五百七十五座新建的水库，做到库成渠通，开挖和整修了大小渠道十六万多条，给两万八千多眼机井套好了提水工具。
    陕西
    大检查促进了抗旱斗争  五千技术工人下乡支援
    新华社西安4日电　陕西省各地社员大力战胜干旱，加强春播准备工作。到3月2日，全省已灌溉越冬作物、休闲田二千六百八十多万亩，并及时春耕、整地和保墒。榆林、汉中两个专区已经耙耱保墒三百二十六万七千多亩，关中地区占棉田总面积将近一半的丰产方棉田，一般都做到了深翻、肥足、保墒、上虚下实、无板结、无裂缝。抢墒播种面积已由南到北逐步展开。到2月26日，陕南三个专区已种洋芋一百三十多万亩，陕北两个专区已种春豌豆、春小麦十二万亩，西安、咸阳两市和陕南三个专区还播种了三十二万亩春菜。
    陕西省入春以来到现在仍未落过透雨，旱情还在继续发展。为了把抗旱斗争推向更高潮，中共陕西省委书记处除因公在外地的书记外，其他书记都深入全省各地检查推动抗旱工作。省级机关抽调了二千多个干部下乡和群众一齐抗旱，并从西安等城市抽调了五千多名技术工人到农村巡回检修排灌机械和农具。各地党委也都大力加强了抗旱领导，通过大检查、大评比、组织参观等，开展了群众性的抗旱备耕运动。汉中、安康两个专区都组织了千人、万人的检查团，到社、队检查、评比抗旱工作。
    在战胜干旱保春播中，各地除大力突击水利扫尾工程外，还开展了大规模打井活动。单是邠县，二十天中就打井五千五百多眼，超过了原计划的十倍。各排灌机械生产、供应单位，也展开了大协作，决定在最近把各地缺少的排灌机械和水车全部制成、修好。各工厂还在赶制提水工具，力争提前出厂配套供应。
    各地都在保证夏田灌溉的同时，尽量扩大秋田的灌溉面积，特别是尽先灌溉马上要播种的田地。铜川市温泉河灌区，实行定额计划用水方法后，大水分区用，小水集中用；晚上分散用，白天集中用；渠水浇长畦、远地，井水浇小畦、近地；白天浇不平的地，晚上浇平地；先浇麦田，后浇休闲地；先浇高地，后浇低洼地；先浇阳坡地，后浇阴坡地。使每秒公方水浇地面积由原来的六百七十亩增加到二千三百四十二亩。渭南县城关公社双王管理区采用夏秋田合理分水的办法，使麦田和棉田全部得到适时灌溉。
    山西
    有旱就抗无旱就防  开源节流滴水归田
    新华社太原4日电　山西省以大抓水利为中心的抗旱防旱运动，声势越来越大。在“天不降雨人降雨”的口号下，全省已有三百多万人投入了突击兴修水利工程和春浇的斗争。各地入春以来扩大和改善的灌溉面积已达八百多万亩，投入灌溉的排灌机械已有六万多马力。全省已春浇耕地四百万亩，大大超过了往年同期的进度。
    山西省从去冬以来境内雨雪稀少。各地人民公社广大社员，在党的领导下，根据有旱就抗无旱就防的精神，都发挥了冲天干劲，千方百计的开源节流，力争滴水归田。晋东南专区在“麦田无雨保丰收，秋田无雨保全苗”的口号下，已有三十万人投入了千库万渠配套运动。晋中专区推广了太谷县创造成功的动力打井机，现在已打成各种水井一万多眼，正在施工的还有六千多眼。晋北地区水利建设的特点是大抓高速度、高工效、高质量的“三高”竞赛，现在平均每日有二百多件水利工程竣工，及时发挥效益；仅水库池塘工程全区就新增加了一千一百多座。
    各地合理用水活动也出现了新的局面。霍汾县大抓合理用水，节约用水，使全县水的利用率比过去提高了63％，扩大浇地面积57％。全县一点三的流量的水，每昼夜平均浇地面积已由过去的九百五十亩增加到二千二百亩。每个流量平均浇地七万六千亩。侯马市曲沃、曲村等公社试制成功人工降雨车，并在丰产方内开始安装地下管道和试行地下灌溉。社员看了这些工程，赞扬说，“天不下雨人下雨，丰收由人不由天。”
    全省工商部门为了全力支援抗旱防旱斗争，正在开展“为农业办一件好事”的活动。晋南专区县营以上的工厂，还抽出了两千一百多名技术工人，组成排灌机械检修队，带着工具和零件深入田间巡回检修。
    广东
    封江堵河引水灌溉  早稻播种基本完成
    新华社广州4日电　广东全省人民以人定胜天的英雄气概，掀起一个蓄水保水和节约用水的防旱抗旱高潮。从2月下旬起在短短十多天时间内，就把除西江以外的大小河流全面堵塞引水灌溉；水利工程的配套工作，也在集中全力加速进行。目前，全省早稻的播种工作已基本上完成，春种的杂粮和经济作物已种了一千七百二十多万亩，全省五百一十多万抗旱大军，正千方百计，日夜提水、引水灌田，准备插秧。季节较早的海南岛，已插下早稻二百一十八万多亩。
    广东省去冬今春的降雨量比往年大大减少。中共广东省委在上月就发出指示，号召全党全民紧急动员起来，全面防旱、抗旱，保证春耕、春种的顺利进行，确保早造大丰收。各级党委也都把抗旱抢播抢种，作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。
    由于广东省河流多，各地在蓄水保水节约用水的群众运动中，都紧紧抓住封江堵河作为中心，现在全省已完成封江堵河的工程十二万六千多处，除西江以外，凡可以利用的河流，都已全部被封堵起来，或正在进行封堵。潮汕平原各人民公社在2月25日胜利完成封锁韩江，使一百二十万亩农田获得灌溉后，接着又开始了“引韩济榕”的创举，劈山开渠，把韩江的水通过十九点五公里的渠道引到榕江，再把榕江堵起来，来灌溉两岸十二万多亩受旱农田，这个工程也已在上月26日全面动工。据目前极不完全的统计，全省通过封江堵河而扩大的灌溉面积已达数百万亩。在大搞封江堵河的同时，原有的水利大军，集中力量大抓工程配套，力争今春建成的工程，能提早赶上春耕用水的需要。此外，各地还根据不同特点，挖成井泉六万一千七百七十眼，修陂筑圳等十九万多处。
