    Danilov Discusses Soviet Film Work
    Film Art Should Face Real Life
    Czech Playwrights and Directors Go Deep into Construction Sites and Rural Areas
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Soviet Deputy Minister of Culture Danilov published an article in the "Soviet Culture Newspaper" on the 1st, discussing several issues in film work.
    Danilov wrote in the article that the recent directive issued by the Soviet Minister of Culture on the issue of film scripts emphasized that film studios and the cultural ministries of all the republics must focus their main attention on creating film scripts that reflect important modern themes, scripts that reflect the lives and labor of the Soviet people and their struggle, under the leadership of the Communist Party, for the victory of communism in our country, and for peace and the friendship of all nationalities.
    Danilov mentioned in the article that all film studios had made serious revisions to their feature film production plans for this year during January and February. These revisions mainly involved adding a large number of films with modern themes to the plans. Danilov cited the plans of many film studios to expand the production of films reflecting modern life.
    Danilov focused on cultivating film scriptwriting talent, saying that a two-year advanced film scriptwriting training class will be established in Moscow, primarily accommodating young people from the republics. During their studies, each student should complete a script that can be made into a film.
    When discussing the issue of film actors, Danilov said that it is necessary to comprehensively consider the training and use of film actors, and to allow talented young actors to appear on the screen at the age of seventeen or eighteen, rather than waiting until they are twenty-three or twenty-four.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Second Czechoslovak Film Festival concluded on February 27th.
    The First Czechoslovak Film Festival was held last February. Over the past year, Czechoslovak film work has taken a step forward in reflecting real life and improving the ideological content of films, following the instructions of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Of the twenty-seven feature films produced in 1959, twenty-two were based on real life. Of the thirty-six feature films planned for production this year, twenty-six reflect real life. These films will have a more pronounced tendency to approach real life than before. Czechoslovak filmmakers are working hard to implement the instructions of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, striving to make workers, peasants, and other laborers the heroes in films. In order to bring films closer to people's lives, Czechoslovak film scriptwriters and directors have gone deep into industrial centers, construction sites, and villages to collect materials.
    Currently, the Czechoslovak film industry has put forward the demand to reflect real life more profoundly, to make films that can inspire the working people to move forward, and truly become the party's powerful assistant in educating the people.

    据新华社讯　苏联文化部副部长达尼洛夫在1日的“苏维埃文化报”上发表文章，谈到了电影工作中的若干问题。
    达尼洛夫在文章中写道，在不久前颁发的苏联文化部长关于电影剧本问题的指令中强调指出，必需集中制片厂以各加盟共和国文化部的主要注意力去创作体现重要的现代主题的电影剧本，创作反映苏联人民的生活、劳动和他们在共产党的领导下为共产主义在我国胜利、为和平和各族人民的友谊斗争的剧本。
    达尼洛夫在文章中提到，所有制片厂在1、2月份内都对今年的故事片生产计划做了认真的修改，这些修改主要是在计划中增添了大量现代主题的影片。达尼洛夫举出许多制片厂扩大拍摄反映现代生活的影片的计划。
    达尼洛夫着重谈到了培养电影剧本创作力量，他说在莫斯科将成立为期两年的高级电影剧本写作训练班，首先容纳来自加盟共和国的青年。在学习期间，每个学员都应完成能拍摄成影片的剧本。
    在谈到电影演员的问题时，达尼洛夫说需要全面考虑培养和使用电影演员，并让有才能的青年演员在十七一十八岁时就能上银幕，而不是等到二十三—二十四岁。
    据新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克第二届电影节已经于2月27日结束。
    捷克斯洛伐克第一届电影节是去年2月举行的。一年来，捷克斯洛伐克电影工作沿着捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央的指示，在反映现实生活和提高影片的思想性方面迈进了一步。在1959年拍摄的二十七部故事片中，有二十二部是以现实生活为题材的。今年计划拍摄的三十六部故事片中，有二十六部是反映现实生活的。这些影片将比以前具有更明显的接近现实生活的倾向。捷克斯洛伐克电影工作者正在为贯彻捷克斯洛伐克共产党的指示，努力使工人、农民，及其他劳动者成为影片中的英雄人物。为了使电影更接近人民生活，捷克斯洛伐克电影剧本作家和导演深入到工业中心、建筑工地和村庄去收集资料。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克电影界提出了更深刻地反映现实生活，使影片能激励劳动人民前进，真正成为党的教育人民的有力助手的要求。
