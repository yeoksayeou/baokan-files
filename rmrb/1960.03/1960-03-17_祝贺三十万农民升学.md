    Congratulations to 300,000 Farmers Entering Higher Education
    300,000 farmers in Jiangsu Province have graduated from spare-time primary schools and have entered spare-time secondary schools. This is a major event.
    In the past, farmers were always considered "mud-legged" people, illiterate and suffering the pain of being blind to words. But now? They have not only become literate, but have also graduated from spare-time primary schools and have entered spare-time secondary schools, becoming middle school students. How fast this change is!
    In the past, schools were out of reach for the working people. Now, the Party and the government care about farmers' learning and have prepared many conditions for their spare-time learning. With the establishment of the People's Communes, things have become even easier. Production organizations are also learning organizations, and schools are located right at their doorsteps, just a step away. Our country was "poor and blank." Poverty and blankness are interconnected. Due to economic poverty, cultural blankness was formed. However, cultural blankness also slowed down the speed of economic development. Poverty and blankness were produced under the social system of man exploiting man. Today, our country has established a socialist social system, the ownership has changed, the labor force has been liberated, the productivity has greatly increased, and the economic construction has developed by leaps and bounds, making it possible to gradually change the cultural blankness and improve the cultural level of the people. At the same time, economic construction requires workers with higher cultural levels to adapt to its needs. Our great ambition is to enable every worker to have a high degree of political consciousness, a high level of culture, and production skills. Our goal is to gradually eliminate the differences between mental and physical labor left over from capitalist society. Therefore, we require every worker not only to change the face of poverty with hard work, but also to change the face of blankness with diligent study. The enrollment of 300,000 farmers in secondary schools in Jiangsu Province is a great and encouraging event. On a national scale, of course, there are even more farmers entering higher education.
    After a period of time, they may be able to enter spare-time universities. In order to complete the cause of socialist construction, we must have a great improvement in the cultural level of the whole people, requiring that the popularization of primary education for the entire people be further developed to the popularization of secondary education, and from the popularization of secondary education, we will take a step to popularize higher education. Today, the enrollment of 300,000 farmers in secondary schools in Jiangsu Province is excellent news. We wish them to study hard, be both red and expert, and become culturally conscious laborers with communist consciousness.
    The "scholarly families" of the past, the monopolizers of cultural knowledge, often boasted in their small courtyards that "learned men chat and laugh, and no uncultured men come and go." However, looking at the scenery of today, it is very different. In the vast countryside, hundreds of millions of farmers are no longer "uncultured men." Not only that, they have also become middle school students and will become college students. They can use both their hands and their brains, which cannot be compared with those so-called "learned men."

### 祝贺三十万农民升学

    祝贺三十万农民升学
    江苏省三十万农民，在业余初等学校毕业，升入了业余中学。这是一件大事。
    农民，在过去，一向被认为是“泥腿子”，目不识丁，尝尽了睁眼瞎子的痛苦。现在呢？他们不但识了字，而且在业余初等学校毕了业，还升入到业余中学，当了中学生。这个变化有多快啊！
    过去，学校是与劳动人民无缘的。现在，党和政府关心农民的学习，为他们的业余学习准备了好多的条件。人民公社成立了，事情就更好办了，生产组织就是学习组织，学校办在家门口，抬腿就到。我们国家“一穷二白”。穷和白是互相联系的。由于经济上的穷，才形成了文化上的白。但是，文化上的白，也延缓了经济发展的速度。穷和白是在人剥削人的社会制度下产生的。我们国家今天已经建立了社会主义的社会制度，所有制改变了，劳动力解放了，生产率大大提高了，经济建设飞跃发展了，就有可能来逐步改变文化上的白的面貌，提高人民的文化水平。同时，经济建设需要具有更高的文化水平的劳动者来适应它的需要。我们的雄心大志是，使每一个劳动者具有高度的政治觉悟，高等的文化水平和生产技能。我们的目的是要逐渐消灭资本主义社会所遗留下来的脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别。因此我们要求每一个劳动者，不仅用辛勤劳动来改变穷的面貌，而且用刻苦学习来改变白的面貌。江苏省三十万农民升中学，是一件鼓舞人心的大喜事。就全国来说，当然还有更多的农民升学。
    他们过了一个时期以后，就有可能升入业余大学。为了完成社会主义的建设事业，我们必须要有全民的文化水平的极大的提高，要求对全体人民由普及初等教育进而达到普及中等教育，而由普及中等教育提高一步，即普及高等教育。今天，江苏省三十万农民入中学是一个极好的消息，祝他们努力学习，又红又专，成为有共产主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。
    过去的“书香门第”，文化知识的垄断者，常常夸耀他们的小院子里“谈笑有鸿儒，往来无白丁”。可是，放眼量量今天的风物，已经大不同了。在广大农村里，上亿农民不再是“白丁”。不仅如此，他们还当上了中学生，还要当上大学生，又能动手，又能动脑，比起那些所谓“鸿儒”来，也是不可以道里计的了。
