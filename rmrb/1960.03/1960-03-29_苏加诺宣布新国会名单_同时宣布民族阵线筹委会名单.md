Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 27th: Indonesian President Sukarno announced the list of the newly formed parliament tonight. He said that this parliament will exercise its powers after he goes abroad for a visit.

The former parliament, elected in the 1955 general election, was ordered by President Sukarno to cease exercising its powers on March 5th because it failed to cooperate with the government as expected.

The newly organized parliament has a total of 261 members. Among them, political party representatives have 130 seats, and professional group representatives have 131 seats. Among the 130 seats belonging to political parties, the three major political parties obtained 110 seats. The seat allocation is as follows: Indonesian National Party, 44 seats; Indonesian Communist Party, 30 seats; Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, 36 seats. The remaining seats belong to smaller political parties.

The right-wing Masyumi Party, which used to have more than 50 seats in parliament and was often opposed to President Sukarno, has been excluded this time. Some smaller political parties have also been excluded from the new parliament. The seats of the three major political parties are also fewer than before.

The list of the new parliamentary speakers has not yet been announced.

When President Sukarno announced the list of the new parliament at the Presidential Palace on the 27th, he said that he called this parliament, which includes representatives from political parties and professional groups, the "Cooperation Parliament." This parliament will "cooperate with the government under Guided Democracy."

Those who attended the ceremony tonight included: Djuanda, the chiefs of staff of the Navy and Air Force, and several ministers. The Army Chief of Staff did not attend the ceremony because he is not currently in Jakarta. Former Speaker of the Parliament, Sartono, also did not participate in the ceremony.

The smaller parties' seats in the new parliament are: Christian Party, 6 seats; Catholic Party and Indonesian Islamic League Party, 5 seats each; Perti Islamic Party, 2 seats; Common People's Party and Indonesian Party, 1 seat each. Among the members of professional groups, army personnel (including nine officers) occupy 15 seats, while the navy and air force each occupy 7 seats. Police, 5 seats; Village Guard, 1 seat. Farmers and workers each occupy 25 seats.

President Sukarno also announced the list of members of the National Front Preparatory Committee tonight. The chairman of this committee is Arudji Kartawinata of the Indonesian Islamic League Party, and the secretary is Lieutenant Colonel Achmadi. The members of this committee include representatives from various political parties and the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, including former Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo of the National Party, Aidit of the Communist Party, the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the Common People's Party, and members of other parties. Sukarno said that this committee will complete its task before May.

    同时宣布民族阵线筹委会名单
    新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今晚宣布了新组织的国会的名单。他说，这个国会将在他出国访问以后行使职权。
    在1955年大选中选出来的前国会是在3月5日奉苏加诺总统的命令停止行使职权的，因为它不能像预期的那样同政府进行合作。
    新组织的国会共有二百六十一名议员。其中，政党代表有一百三十席，专业团体代表有一百三十一席。在属于政党的一百三十席当中，三个大政党得到一百零十席。席位分配如下：印度尼西亚国民党四十四席。印度尼西亚共产党三十席。印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会三十六席。其余的席位属于小政党。
    右翼政党马斯友美党过去在议会中有五十多席，经常是反对苏加诺总统的，这次被排除掉了。有些小政党也被排除在新国会外面。三个大政党的席位也比以前少了一些。
    新国会议长的名单尚未宣布。
    苏加诺总统27日在总统府宣布新国会名单的时候说，他把这个包括政党和专业团体代表的国会叫作“合作国会”。这个国会“将在有领导的民主下同政府合作”。
    出席今天晚上的仪式的有：朱安达、海军和空军的参谋长和若干部长。陆军参谋长没有出席仪式，因为他现在不在雅加达。前议长沙多诺也没有参加仪式。
    较小的党派在新国会中的席位是：基督教党六席。天主教党和印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党各五席，白尔蒂伊斯兰党两席。平民党和印度尼西亚党各一席。在专业团体的议员中，陆军人员（包括九名校官）占十五席，而海军和空军各占七席。警察五席，乡村警卫队一席。农民和工人各占二十五席。
    苏加诺总统今天晚上还宣布了民族阵线筹备委员会委员的名单。这个委员会的主席是印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党的阿鲁季·卡塔威纳塔，书记是阿赫马迪中校。这个委员会的委员中包括各政党和争取解放西伊里安民族阵线的代表，其中有前总理、国民党的沙斯特罗阿米佐约，共产党的艾地，印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会、平民党以及其他党派的成员。苏加诺说，这个委员会将在5月以前完成它的任务。
