Xinhua News Agency report: Socialist countries' newspapers have been commenting on the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference in recent days, exposing the Western countries' conspiracy in the so-called "disarmament" plan.
    Soviet "Pravda": The Essence of the Western Plan is to Collect Intelligence Without Disarmament

    Soviet "Pravda" published a commentary by its Geneva correspondent, Grishchenko, on the 20th, stating that the so-called "disarmament plan" proposed by the West does not stipulate complete and thorough disarmament, but only some individual measures without a specified date for implementation. The commentary pointed out that the main focus of the Western proposal is on collecting intelligence about the other side's armed forces. Even some Western figures admit that their proposal is not for the purpose of complete and thorough disarmament.

    In a commentary on the 18th regarding the Western disarmament plan, Grishchenko said that the characteristic of this plan is that it contains all the shortcomings of the original US, British, and French plans.

    Grishchenko pointed out that collecting information about armed forces without disarmament is the true meaning of the Western plan.

    Korean "Rodong Sinmun": The United States is Frenziedly Preparing for War Under the Guise of "Talks"

    Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 18th stating that at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, "the Soviet proposal suggests that all countries in the world achieve complete and thorough disarmament within four years. However, the disarmament 'plan' proposed by the five Western countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Italy, at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee is completely contrary to the expectations of people all over the world."

    The commentary pointed out, "The fact is very clear that, in order to restore the long-bankrupt 'policy of strength,' the US imperialists are more frantically engaged in arms expansion and war preparations than ever before, using a two-faced tactic behind the smoke screen of empty talk about 'peace' and 'talks.'" The commentary said that people all over the world are closely watching whether the Western countries, headed by the United States, have sincerity in this disarmament conference.

    Vietnamese "Nhan Dan": The Western Plan is Essentially Against Disarmament

    Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on the 18th, criticizing the disarmament plan proposed by the West at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, saying, "The so-called disarmament plan, which was masterminded by the United States under the domination of the idea of an arms race, is essentially a plan against disarmament."

    The editorial said that the only measure proposed in the Western countries' plan is supervision, and the purpose of supervision is to spy on other countries' military bases.

    The editorial praised the Soviet Union for its disarmament carried out with practical actions and its efforts for disarmament. The editorial pointed out that, in contrast to the Soviet Union, "although the United States and Western countries have announced their support for disarmament, they are actually very enthusiastic about the arms race. The United States and its servant countries have been increasing their military budgets, the United States has been exporting missiles and atomic weapons abroad, and has declared that it reserves the 'freedom' to test nuclear weapons. The United States has also proposed a ten-year war preparedness plan to the North Atlantic Group."

    Romanian "Scinteia": The West Conspires to Turn the Disarmament Conference into a Smoke Screen for Arms Expansion

    Romanian "Scinteia" condemned certain Western groups in an international review on the 20th for conspiring to turn the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting into a smoke screen for continuing arms expansion. The commentary said, "The people of all countries will never allow this attempt to succeed."

    The commentary said that the West's so-called "universal disarmament plan" does not stipulate any deadlines or specific disarmament measures. The "supervision" it suggests is not supervision of disarmament measures, but supervision of armaments. The plan does not mention stopping nuclear weapons testing, nor does it remain silent on the elimination of foreign military bases.

    Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo": The Enemies of Peace are Playing a Two-Faced Game

    Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" pointed out in a commentary on the 19th that the so-called "disarmament plan" proposed by Western countries at the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting clearly shows that in Western countries, the forces opposing the easing of international tensions still have the upper hand. The enemies of peace dare not openly oppose disarmament, dare not openly oppose the will of the people of all countries, so they are playing a two-faced game.
    Hungarian "Népszabadság": The West Pushes Disarmament Measures into the Distant Future

    Hungarian "Népszabadság" said in a current affairs review of "International Week" on the 19th that the plan proposed by Western countries at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting did not propose a date for achieving disarmament at all, and even partial and specific disarmament measures were pushed into the distant future. According to this plan, the first stage of "disarmament" will be used to collect various intelligence without taking any specific disarmament measures. The plan does not mention the elimination of military bases abroad, nor does it mention the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing.

    社会主义国家报刊评十国裁军会议
    揭露西方国家阻挠裁军的阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：社会主义国家的报刊连日纷纷就十国裁军会议发表评论，揭露西方国家提出的“裁军”计划的阴谋。苏联“真理报”：西方计划的实质是收集情报而不裁军
    苏联“真理报”20日发表驻日内瓦记者格里希申科的评论说，西方提出的所谓“裁军计划”规定的不是全面彻底裁军，而只是一些没有规定实现日期的个别措施。评论指出，西方建议的主要注意力是放在搜集对方武装力量的情报上。连西方有些人物也承认，他们的建议不是为了全面彻底裁军的目的。
    格里希申科18日在评论西方的裁军计划时说，这个计划的特点是包含了美英法原来的计划的全部缺点。
    格里希申科指出，收集关于武装部队的情报，而不进行裁军，这就是西方计划的真正涵义。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”：美国在“会谈”烟幕下猖狂备战
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”18日发表评论说，在十国裁军会议上，“苏联的提案建议世界各国在四年内实现全面彻底的裁军。但是，美、英、法、加、意等五个西方国家在十国裁军委员会提出的裁军‘计划’，是和全世界人民的期待完全背道而驰的”。
    评论指出，“事实很明显，美帝国主义者为了恢复早已破产的‘实力政策’，以两面手法，在空谈‘和平’、‘会谈’的烟幕后面，比任何时候都猖狂地进行着扩军备战。”评论说，全世界人民密切注视着以美国为首的西方国家在这次裁军会议上有无诚意。
    越南“人民报”：西方的计划实质上是反对裁军
    越南“人民报”18日发表社论抨击西方在十国裁军会议上提出的裁军计划说，“西方国家在军备竞赛思想支配下提出的由美国一手策划的所谓裁军计划，实质上是反对裁军的计划。”
    社论说，西方国家的计划所提出的唯一的措施是监督，而监督的目的是窥探别国的军事基地。
    社论赞扬了苏联以实际行动实行的裁军和为裁军所作的努力。社论指出，同苏联相反，“美国和西方国家虽然宣布赞成裁军，但实际上却非常热中于军备竞赛。美国及其仆从国家一直在增加军事预算，美国一直在向国外输出导弹和原子武器，并且声明它保留试验核武器的‘自由权’。美国还向北大西洋集团提出十年备战计划”。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”：西方阴谋把裁军会议变成扩军烟幕
    罗马尼亚“火花报”20日在国际述评中谴责西方某些集团阴谋把十国裁军委员会会议变成继续扩军的烟幕。评论说：“各国人民永远不会允许这种企图得逞”。
    评论说，西方的所谓“普遍裁军计划”没有规定任何期限和具体的裁军措施。它所建议的“监督”，不是对裁军措施的监督，而是对军备的监督。这个计划对停止核武器试验只字不提，对取消国外军事基地也保持缄默。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”：和平的敌人正在耍两面手法
    保加利亚“工人事业报”19日在评论中指出，西方国家在日内瓦十国裁军委员会会议上提出的所谓“裁军计划”，清楚地表明，在西方国家中，反对缓和国际紧张局势的势力仍然占着上风。和平的敌人不敢公开反对裁军，不敢公开反对各国人民的意志，因此正在耍弄两面手法。匈牙利“人民自由报”：西方把裁军措施推到遥远未来
    匈牙利“人民自由报”19日在“国际一周”的时事述评中说，西方国家在十国裁军委员会会议上提出的计划，根本没有提出实现裁军的日期，即使连局部和具体的裁军措施也被推到了遥远的未来。根据这个计划，“裁军”的第一阶段将是用来收集各种情报，而不采取任何具体的裁军措施。计划既没有提到要取消在外国的军事基地，也没有提到要禁止核武器试验。
