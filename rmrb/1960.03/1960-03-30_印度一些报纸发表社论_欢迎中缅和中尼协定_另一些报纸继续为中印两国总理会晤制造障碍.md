Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 28th. Some Indian newspapers have published editorials welcoming the border agreements signed between China and Nepal.

The Bengali newspaper "Freedom" said in an editorial on the 27th, "Because China has successively signed border agreements with Myanmar and Nepal, it has dealt two huge blows to the conspiracies of imperialism and various reactionaries." The resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue will give the imperialist conspiracies a third blow, which is also inevitable.

The editorial pointed out that working together to eliminate the border disputes left over by past imperialist rulers is an urgent task. Imperialism is not only trying to maintain these disputes, but also conspiring to expand them, attacking the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and undermining the unity of Asian and African countries.

The editorial said that the successful signing of the Sino-Myanmar border agreement and the Sino-Nepal border agreement have exposed the lies of imperialism and reactionaries. The fabrication of "aggression from China" has burst like a soap bubble. Moreover, through the signing of the Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship, the unity and friendship between China and Myanmar have been strengthened. Nepal will receive considerable unconditional and selfless financial and technical assistance. This assistance will help Nepal in its struggle for economic independence.

The editorial said that imperialism and India's reactionaries are still plotting new conspiracies to hinder China and India from reaching an agreement. The editorial said, "If we remain vigilant against imperialism and remain loyal to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, any disputes between our two countries (India and China) will be easy to resolve. The agreements signed between China and Myanmar and China and Nepal prove this. Therefore, on the eve of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to our country, an excellent background has been created."

The Hindi newspaper "Hindustan Daily" said in an editorial on the 26th that the "survey and demarcation of the border" between China and Nepal "has been finalized, and the uncertain state of the border will end from now on." The editorial, in discussing the Sino-Nepal economic assistance agreement, said, "China has once again demonstrated its goodwill towards Nepal. China will provide Nepal with 100 million Indian rupees for its economic development." The editorial said that it was announced that the Chinese Premier will visit Nepal to discuss and sign a Sino-Nepal treaty of peace and friendship with Nepal. This should be welcomed.

The newspaper also praised the friendly and neutral policy pursued by the Nepalese government.

"Glory" published an editorial on the 26th on the Sino-Nepal border agreement, saying that this agreement will be universally welcomed. The editorial said, "The Sino-Myanmar (border) agreement has already changed the atmosphere, and the Sino-Nepal (border) agreement has undoubtedly made the atmosphere even more pleasant." The editorial also said that the talks between the Chinese and Indian premiers will also produce results. The signing of the Sino-Nepal border agreement has made the prospect of China and India reaching an agreement on the border issue better than before. The editorial said that the Sino-Nepal (border) agreement is not only important for Sino-Nepal relations, but will also affect the talks between the Chinese and Indian premiers.

"The Tribune" said on the 25th: "The Sino-Nepal agreement is a good omen for the Nehru-Zhou Enlai talks in Delhi." The newspaper said, "Zhou Enlai's acceptance of Nehru's invitation to hold talks has increased hope, despite the pessimistic tone of some people." However, the newspaper groundlessly accused China of creating complex and difficult situations. It said, "Whether these hopes are realized now depends on China." However, some Indian newspapers are trying to minimize the significance of the Sino-Nepal border agreement, spreading skepticism about it, and continuing to create obstacles to the upcoming meeting between the Chinese and Indian premiers.

"Hindustan Flag Daily" distorted the facts on the 27th, saying that China can afford to be generous on both the Myanmar and Nepal issues because these disputes are insignificant. It also attacked, saying, "The Chinese government has been eager to offset the bad things it has done to India by being particularly friendly to Myanmar - and now to Nepal."

    印度一些报纸发表社论
    欢迎中缅和中尼协定
    另一些报纸继续为中印两国总理会晤制造障碍
    新华社新德里28日电　印度一些报纸发表社论，欢迎中国和尼泊尔签订的边界协定。
    孟加拉文“自由报”27日的社论说，“由于中国先后同缅甸和尼泊尔签订了边界协定，给予帝国主义和各种反动派的阴谋以两次巨大的打击。”而中印边界问题的解决，将给予帝国主义的阴谋第三次打击，这个打击也是不可避免的。
    社论指出，同心协力地来消灭过去帝国主义统治者遗留下来的边界争端，这是一项迫切的任务。帝国主义不仅试图保持这种争端，并且阴谋扩大这种争端，攻击和平共处五项原则和破坏亚非国家的团结。
    社论说，中缅边界协定和中尼边界协定的成功签订，使帝国主义和反动派的谎言暴露无遗了。关于“来自中国的侵略”的捏造像肥皂泡般地破灭了。不仅如此，通过中缅友好条约的签订，中缅的团结和友好已经加强了。尼泊尔将得到可观的无条件的和无私的财经和技术援助。这种援助有助于尼泊尔争取经济独立的斗争。
    社论说，帝国主义和印度的反动派还在策划新的阴谋，阻挠中印达成协议。社论说，“如果我们对帝国主义保持警惕，并且仍忠于和平共处五项原则，我们（印中）两国的任何争端将易于解决。中国先后同缅甸和尼泊尔签订的协定证明了这一点。因此，在中国周恩来总理访问我国前夕，已经创造了极好的背景。”
    印地文“印度斯坦日报”26日的社论说，中国和尼泊尔的“边界的勘察和划定已成定局，边界的不确定状态就将从此结束”。社论在谈到中尼两国的经济援助协定时说，“中国再一次表明它对尼泊尔的善意。中国将给予尼泊尔一亿印度卢比，供它从事经济发展之用。”社论说，据宣布，中国总理将访问尼泊尔，同尼泊尔讨论和签订尼中和平友好条约。这是应该欢迎的。
    这家报纸还赞扬尼泊尔政府奉行的友好和中立政策。
    “光荣报”在26日就中尼边界协定发表社论说，这项协定将受到普遍欢迎。社论说，“中缅（边界）协定已经使气氛有了改变，中尼（边界）协定无疑使气氛有了进一步的令人愉快的改变。”社论又说，印中两国总理的会谈也将产生成果。中尼边界协定的签订，使印中两国就边界问题达成协议的前景比以前好了。社论说，中尼（边界）协定不仅对中尼两国关系来说是重要的，而且对印中两国总理的会谈也将发生影响。
    “论坛报”25日说：“中尼协定对于尼赫鲁和周恩来的德里会谈是一个吉兆。”这家报纸说，“周恩来接受尼赫鲁邀请来进行会谈，已增加了希望，尽管若干人士发出悲观论调。”但是这家报纸毫无根据地指责中国制造复杂和困难局势。它说，“这些希望是否实现，现在取决于中国。”但是，印度有一些报纸竭力缩小中尼边界协定的意义，就这项协定散播怀疑论调，并且继续为中印两国总理即将举行的会晤制造障碍。
    “印度斯坦旗报”27日歪曲说，在缅甸和尼泊尔这两个问题上，中国都可以表现得很慷慨，因为这些纠纷是无足轻重的。它并攻击说，“中国政府一直急于要以对缅甸——现在是对尼泊尔——特别友好的做法，来抵消它对印度所做的坏事”。
