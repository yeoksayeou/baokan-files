Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: April 4th is the great festival of the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. Szigeti, Chargé d'Affaires of the Hungarian Embassy in China, held a press conference this afternoon to introduce the brilliant achievements Hungary has made in the past fifteen years.

Szigeti said that Hungary has achieved historically unprecedented achievements in these short fifteen years. In our country's fifteen years, industrial production has increased nearly threefold, socialist types of management have become dominant in agricultural production, and agricultural production increased by 10% in 1958 and 1959. National income doubled from 1949 to 1959, and the people's living standards also increased by 50%. There has also been great development in cultural education and health services. Now the Hungarian people are carrying out a socialist labor competition to achieve the targets of the second five-year plan.

Szigeti said that the Hungarian working people, tempered in struggle, have constantly received fraternal support and assistance from socialist countries in the past and present. The Hungarian people will never forget this support and will always be grateful for these selfless actions of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries.

After the press conference, a Hungarian documentary film was shown.
