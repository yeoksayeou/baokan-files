Xinhua News Agency report: Chengdu. Sichuan Province's Party committees at all levels are taking various measures to strive to elevate the agricultural production level of all counties in the province to the level of advanced counties. Currently, the spring production campaign vigorously unfolding throughout the province has seen a new leap forward characterized by the whole population being of one mind, putting forth tremendous effort, and doing things uniformly. Various production tasks are advancing in a coordinated manner: More than 50 million mu of spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed have generally been top-dressed and irrigated three or four times, and high-yield fields have been top-dressed and irrigated five or six times. The growth of seedlings has greatly exceeded previous years, with first- and second-class seedlings accounting for about 90%. The sowing of early spring crops and preparations for major spring production have also been done quickly and well. By early March, the province's early corn sowing plan had been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. More than 2.3 million mu of early rice seedlings have been cultivated, and the sweet potato sowing plan has also been basically completed. In spring sowing, advanced techniques such as cultivating strong seedlings in batches and directional close planting have been universally implemented. Advanced experiences such as warm-bed seedling cultivation of cotton and sweet potatoes, which were used in a few advanced counties last year, have been widely promoted throughout the province this year. The sowing and seedling cultivation time of various major spring crops is, on average, one to two solar terms earlier than in previous years.

Sichuan Province has achieved bumper harvests for ten consecutive years. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, agricultural production has made tremendous achievements. Grain, cotton, oil, and various economic crops have all developed at high speed. However, compared between communes and communes, counties and counties, there are still three situations: advanced, intermediate, and backward. The increase in production varies, and the increase in production in a few advanced counties is quite prominent. The per-plant yield of various "King" crops planted in large quantities in various places is several times or even dozens of times higher than the general yield. These differences show that there is still huge potential for increasing production in various places.

In order to rapidly improve the agricultural production level of the entire province to the level of advanced counties, Party committees at all levels have prominently focused on grasping the advanced, widely establishing high-yield pacesetters, and rapidly spreading their advanced thinking and various advanced experiences in leading agricultural production. Lezhi County and Wusheng County, the province's red flag counties, do not have good natural conditions, but the whole Party and the entire population of these two counties were of one mind and put forth tremendous effort, continuously realizing a comprehensive leap forward in various productions and works in 1958 and 1959. At the beginning of this year, these two counties created a new situation of magnificent and comprehensive leap forward. Not only were spring crops planted more and grown better, but also the preparations for various major spring productions were more sufficient and solid than in any previous year. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee earnestly summarized the advanced experiences of these two counties and called on the entire province to learn from them. So far, whether in plains, hills, or mountainous areas, and for various crops such as grain, cotton, and oil, high-yield counties have been established as pacesetters, and a complete set of increased production experiences has been accumulated. Responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels went deep into the masses and treated various advanced experiences emerging in production and work with full enthusiasm, and promptly summarized and promoted them once they were discovered. Since last winter, the province and various special districts have widely convened more than 100 on-site meetings on wheat, rapeseed, cotton, and sweet potatoes, taking various high-yield counties as bases, and vigorously exchanging and promoting advanced experiences. Neijiang Special District adopted methods combining politics and technology, and combining leadership and the masses. By combining theory with practice, it summarized and refined the scattered and piecemeal experiences of various counties last year into more than 200 relatively systematic experiences. Then, with high-yield counties of various crops as classrooms and advanced experiences as teaching materials, technical backbones were trained. Recently, the district trained more than 3,000 technical backbones for rice, cotton, sugarcane, peanut, and other crops for major spring production, averaging seven to eight people per commune. After these technicians went back, they held various training classes to impart technology layer by layer, so that the advanced experience of individual high-yield counties quickly spread to every corner of the district. In addition to earnestly summarizing the high-yield experiences of various crops, Pi County and other places also organized the creators of high-yield experience into agricultural technology reporting groups, which went to various places to make reports on tour and explain on the spot.

Sichuan's people cultivate all kinds of "King" crops, promote high-yield paths, and widely carry out the "Learn From, Catch Up With, Surpass, and Help" emulation campaign, which has effectively promoted the rapid improvement of general production levels. This year, after the province universally promoted the experience of Zhong County, a high-yield rapeseed county, more than one billion rapeseed "King" plants were planted. Various places also carried out a heated competition for general fields to learn from the rapeseed "King" and implement high-standard field management, promoting general fields to learn from advanced fields.

The upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced is surging throughout the province. In order to catch up with Lezhi County, cadres and farmers in many areas, led by leading cadres at all levels, went to visit overnight, some with quilts and some with rations. In just two months, more than 30,000 cadres and farmers from more than ten special districts and more than 100 counties throughout the province went to Lezhi County for visits and learning. Many visiting cadres and farmers called back overnight to spread advanced experiences, and some launched debates on the spot to formulate catch-up plans. Nanchong, Wenjiang, Neijiang and other special districts also generally adopted the method of linking general counties with advanced counties to carry out cooperative competitions and promote each other.

For some counties and communes whose production level is lower than the provincial level, various places have carried out specific analysis. To sum up, most of them are due to the weak cadre force, remote areas, and poor natural conditions. Therefore, various places have prescribed the right medicine and taken different measures according to different situations. For areas with a weak cadre force, the main thing is to send more cadres to strengthen leadership. According to incomplete statistics, the province has recently dispatched more than 120 county-level leading cadres to various weak links on the agricultural front. Various places have also selected a large number of cadres with firm positions, full enthusiasm, and in-depth style, and established strong leadership cores at all levels. Preliminary statistics from Fuling, Wanxian, and other nine special districts show that more than 12,000 activists have recently been selected to fill the leadership positions at the commune, management area, and production team levels. Neijiang Special District organized a professional team of more than 1,000 people to tackle backward areas and specifically help backward areas with low production levels. For areas that are remote and have poor natural conditions, and for poor communes and teams, various places mainly strengthen their ideological education and encourage them to establish lofty ambitions and rely on their own efforts. Neijiang County specially convened a meeting of representatives of 49 poor teams in the county. Through organizing debates, everyone realized that the fundamental problem of rapidly changing the poor situation lies in further boosting revolutionary enthusiasm and tapping the potential for increasing production. After discussion, the ambition to catch up with rich teams was greatly stimulated, and production plans for catching up with rich teams and changing the situation were formulated. After mobilizing the masses to find the reasons and make plans, the cadres and members of Guangling District Team, a poor team in Zhongxing Commune, Wulong County, were ambitious and high-spirited. In just three days, all the wheat in the team was hoeed and watered twice, and more than 85% of the land for major spring production was deep-plowed. At the same time, the state also vigorously provides support and assistance to poor communes and teams in terms of funds, technology, and materials. Many areas have formulated plans for the advanced to drive the backward, and rich teams to help poor teams. Industrial, financial, economic, and cultural and educational departments have also worked together enthusiastically to help, so that "if one place has difficulties, everyone will help."

    一条心大鼓革命干劲　一股劲大挖增产潜力
    四川要把各县农业生产提高到先进县水平
    增产经验迅速传播　“学赶超帮”竞赛热烈展开　春季生产运动波澜壮阔
    本报讯　四川省各级党委采取各种措施，力争将全省各县的农业生产水平都提高到先进县的水平。目前，全省各地蓬勃开展的春季生产运动出现了全民一条心、一股劲、一个样的新的跃进局面，各项生产工作正齐头并进：五千多万亩小麦、油菜等小春作物已普遍追肥、灌水三四次，高产田追肥灌水五、六次，苗稼生长大大超过往年，一、二类苗占90％左右。早春作物播种和大春生产准备，也做得又快又好。到3月上旬全省早玉米播种计划已提前超额完成，培育早稻秧苗二百三十多万亩，甘薯播种计划也基本完成。在春播中，各地普遍贯彻分批培育壮秧、定向密植等先进技术。去年少数先进县的棉花、甘薯温床育苗等先进经验，今年已在全省普遍推广。各种大春作物的播种育苗时间，平均比往年提早一至二个节令。
    四川省连获十年丰收，特别是1958年大跃进以来，农业生产取得了巨大成就。粮、棉、油以及各种经济作物都得到高速度的发展。但是，公社与公社、县与县之间比较起来还存在着先进、中间和落后的三种状况，增产幅度各有不同，少数先进县增产幅度相当突出。各地大量种植的各种作物“王”的单株产量，更是数倍甚至数十倍地超过一般产量。这些差别表明，各地农业生产仍然存在着巨大的增产潜力。
    为了把全省农业生产水平迅速提高到先进县的水平，各级党委在领导农业生产中都突出地注意抓先进，广树高产标兵，并把他们的先进思想和各种先进经验，迅速传播。全省红旗县——乐至县和武胜县自然条件并不好，但是这两个县全党全民一条心、一股劲，连续实现了1958年1959年各项生产和工作的全面跃进。今年一开始，这两个县又创造出一个波澜壮阔、全面跃进的新形势。不仅小春作物种得多、长得好，而且大春各项生产准备比任何一年充分、扎实。最近省委认真总结了这两个县的先进经验，号召全省学习。到目前为止，全省无论是平坝、丘陵和山区，以及粮、棉、油等各种作物，都树立有高产县作标兵，并积累了成套的增产经验。各级党委负责同志深入群众、满腔热情对待生产和工作中涌现出的各种先进经验，一经发现就及时加以总结推广。去冬以来，全省和各专区以各高产县为基地，广泛召开了小麦、油菜、棉花、甘薯等现场会一百多次，大力交流和推广先进经验。内江专区采取政治与技术相结合、领导与群众相结合等办法，就实论虚、虚实结合，把去年各县分散零星的经验，总结提炼成比较系统的经验达两百多项。然后又以各种作物高产县为课堂，先进经验为教材，培养技术骨干。全区最近为大春生产训练的水稻、棉花、甘蔗、花生等技术骨干就有三千多人，平均每个公社有七至八人。这些技术人员回去后又举办各种训练班，层层传授技术，使个别高产县的先进经验迅速普及到全区各个角落。郫县等地除认真总结各项作物的高产经验外，还将高产经验的创造者组成农业技术报告团，到各地巡回报告，就地讲解。
    四川全民培植各种作物“王”，大搞高产路，广泛开展“学、赶、超、帮”的竞赛运动，有力地促进了一般生产水平的迅速提高。今年全省普遍推广油菜高产县忠县的经验后，种植了油菜王十多亿株。各地还开展了一般田向油菜“王”看齐的高标准田间管理的热烈竞赛，推动了一般田向先进田看齐。
    全省各地广泛开展的学先进，赶先进，超先进的竞赛热潮汹涌澎湃。为了追赶乐至县，许多地区的干部和农民，都由各级领导干部亲自带领，有的带上被盖，有的背上干粮，星夜赶去参观。仅两个月时间，全省就有十多个专区，一百多个县的三万多干部和农民去乐至县进行参观学习。不少参观访问的干部和农民都连夜打电话回去传播先进经验，有的还就地开展辩论，制订追赶规划。南充、温江、内江等专区还普遍采取一般县与先进县挂钩，开展对手协作竞赛，相互促进。
    对于生产水平低于全省水平以下的部分县、社，各地进行了具体分析，归纳起来，大都是由于干部力量弱、地区偏僻和自然条件差等原因。因此，各地对症下药，根据不同情况，采取了不同措施。对于干部力量弱的地区，主要是增派干部，加强领导。据不完全统计，全省最近增派到农业战线各薄弱环节的县一级领导干部就有一百二十多人。各地还选拔了大批立场坚定，干劲十足，作风深入的干部，层层树立坚强的领导核心。涪陵、万县等九个专区的初步统计，最近选拔了一万二千多名积极分子，充实公社、管理区和生产队各级领导岗位。内江专区组织了一千多人的突击落后地区专业队，具体帮助生产水平较低的落后地区。对于地区偏僻、自然条件较差的地区和穷社穷队，各地主要是加强他们的思想教育，鼓励他们树立雄心大志，自力更生。内江县专门召开了全县四十九个穷队的代表会，通过组织辩论，大家认识到迅速改变穷困面貌的根本问题在于进一步鼓足革命干劲，大挖增产潜力。经过讨论大大激发了追赶富队的志气，行行制订了追赶富队改变面貌的生产规划。武隆县中兴公社的穷队广岭区队发动群众找原因订规划后，广大干部和社员雄心勃勃、斗志昂扬。仅三天时间全队小麦即全部二薅二淋，大春土地85％以上完成了深翻。与此同时，国家还在资金、技术、物资等方面大力给穷社穷队以支援和帮助，许多地区制订了先进带动落后，富队帮穷队的规划，工业、财经、文教等部门也一齐动手，热情帮助，做到了“一地有困难、大家来支援”。（附图片）
