    A Bouquet of Flowers Dedicated with Utmost Loyalty
    Today, this newspaper published some letters, thank you letters from mothers, children, and women in different work positions. Thank you to the aunties who serve the children, thank you to the hard-working people in the canteens, and thank you to the thoughtful service stations. This is not an ordinary bouquet of thank-you notes, but a true bouquet of flowers that never fades.
    Female workers will use outstanding work achievements to thank the aunties; kindergarten teachers will study politics and culture well and take better care of the children; elementary school students will strive to be top students. Can all this be compared to an ordinary bouquet of flowers! It represents people's lofty hearts and expresses their hearts of striving upwards and constantly making progress. They are willing to express this brightness in their thoughts, and would never tell an irrelevant person, only that respected person. This is a flower that is always full of the breath of spring and has infinite vitality, predicting an even greater victory for socialism in our country.
    To whom should such precious and noble flowers be dedicated? Only to those who dedicate their utmost loyalty to socialist construction. These people leave the difficulties to themselves and make things convenient for others for the sake of socialist construction. Their work principle is to make everyone satisfied. Whether it is adults or children, whether it is day or night, no matter what the job is, they must do it perfectly. They never think of asking others for thanks or praise, but sincere thanks and praise always follow them. These selfless people who are dedicated to benefiting others, under the care and cultivation of the Party, their loyalty becomes more and more red, then, the flowers in people's hearts are always presented to these people with a communist style.

    一束鲜花献丹心
    今天本报发表了一些来信，是妈妈、孩子和不同工作岗位上的妇女的感谢信。感谢那些为孩子们服务的阿姨，感谢那些在食堂里辛勤劳动的人们，感谢那些周到的服务站。这不是一束平常的感谢信，而是真正的开不败的鲜花。
    女工要用出色的工作成绩，感谢阿姨；保育员要学好政治和文化，把孩子带得更好；小学生要做一个优等生。所有这些，难道是一束普通的鲜花所能比拟的吗！它代表着人们崇高的心，表达了人们天天向上、不断进取的心。他们愿意把自己思想上这种亮光表现出来，决不会告诉一个不相干的人，只能是那敬爱的人。这是永远充满春天气息、带有无限生命力的鲜花，预示着我国社会主义更大的胜利。
    这样珍贵而崇高的鲜花献给谁呢？只有献给那些为社会主义建设一片丹心的人。这些人为了社会主义建设，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。他们的工作准则，就是要使人人满意。不管是大人、小孩，不管是白天黑夜，也不管是什么工作，都要做得尽善尽美。他们从没有想到要别人感谢和赞仰，可是，真诚的感谢和赞仰却永远跟随着他们。这些毫不利己、专门利人的人，在党的关怀和培养下，丹心越炼越红，那末，人们心灵的鲜花，总是捧献给这些具有共产主义风格的人的。
