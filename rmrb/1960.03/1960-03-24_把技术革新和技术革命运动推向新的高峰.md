    Push the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement to a New Peak
    Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    In the sustained leap forward of China's national economy, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage, which is an important part of the new stage of China's socialist construction. Judging from the situation in Jilin Province, the new development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is mainly reflected in the following aspects: the movement has a large scale and a national character, and the broad masses of workers have shown a high degree of awareness and bold pioneering spirit, and a boiling scene like the mass steelmaking in 1958 has appeared. The content of technical innovation has developed from simply innovating operation methods and production tools to innovating the entire process, changing product design, and transforming the entire equipment structure, and then forming a trend of large-scale and comprehensive technical transformation of the entire enterprise and the entire industry with planning and leadership. The movement has developed the experience of socialist competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, and advanced experience has been promoted from decentralized individual items to industry-wide supporting sets; in the movement, many enterprises have also made considerable progress in adopting new technologies, cutting-edge technologies, and creating new products and cutting-edge products. Mass scientific and technological research is very active, and comprehensive utilization is vigorously promoted, further enriching the content of technical innovation and technical revolution. In terms of the leadership of the movement, a new situation has emerged in which "everyone moves together from top to bottom, everyone grasps both large and small, and both indigenous and foreign methods are used together," and the combination of centralized leadership and vigorous mass movement is closely combined, so the movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth.
    Production Technology Level Greatly Improved
    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has promoted the further development of productive forces, promoted the great improvement of production technology level, and also promoted profound changes in people's mental state. In the past three months, hundreds of automatic production lines and continuous production lines have appeared in Jilin Province, and the level of mechanization and automation in various sectors of the province's national economy has been significantly improved. In the industrial sector, the proportion of workers engaged in manual labor has decreased from 61.8% at the beginning of the year to 53.8%. Tens of thousands of people have abandoned axes, sledgehammers, shovels, and shoulder pads, and have been liberated from heavy physical labor, thereby changing the technical appearance of production in some departments. Due to the technological changes in production, a large amount of labor, equipment, and investment have been saved, and labor productivity has been greatly improved. Like the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Jilin Chemical Company Dye Factory, which have both realized the plan of turning one factory into three factories, the phenomenon of equipment renovation and production doubling, such as "one person tops a gang, one machine tops several machines, and one factory tops several factories," has become a general trend, thus overfulfilling the plans for developing the national economy in January and February. At the same time, due to the improvement of working conditions, the broad masses of workers are beaming with joy. They praise the technical revolution and the Communist Party. A poem by a porter wrote: "In the past, we used our shoulders to carry, sweat dripping and our waists and legs aching. Although we had enough energy, the efficiency was low, and sometimes the workshop ran out of raw materials; now we have realized a continuous line, and every worker smiles. We have saved 160 people and increased efficiency by 8.5 times." Workers in Liaoyuan City said: "The Party's leadership is really good, the technical revolution is a treasure, everyone uses their hands and brains, and manual operations are gone; indigenous methods produce machines, and output and quality are greatly improved." Obviously, a series of changes caused by the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are of great economic and political significance. Because the continuous progress of technology, the rapid increase of labor productivity, and the leap forward development of productive forces will surely accelerate the process of China's socialist construction and thus rapidly change China's "poor and blank" face. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "China can only completely complete the socialist transformation in terms of social and economic system, and in terms of technology, use machine operations in all departments and places where machine operations can be used, so that the social and economic face can be completely changed." (On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation)
    The emergence of the new situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is not accidental. This is due to the fact that the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the broad masses of workers and people are eager to change China's "poor and blank" situation and strongly expect to build socialism at a higher speed; due to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning and encourage efforts, and to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy; due to the encouragement of the continuous leap forward of the national economy, the completion of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and the slogan of catching up with Britain in ten years; due to the inspiration of the anti-rightist rectification and socialist education movement, all positive factors have been mobilized. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers and people have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and are full of vigor and high morale, and have emerged with infinite power and wisdom to create history. "Add strength to strength, add skill to skill, make innovations, and race against time"; "The Foolish Old Man moves the mountain too slowly, we must learn from Erlang to carry the mountain." These bold words fully demonstrate their grand ambitions and heroic spirit. This revolutionary spirit has generated a strong heat, pushing the waves of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement forward. On this blank paper of our motherland, beautiful pictures have been drawn and moving poems have been written.
    It is a Production Movement and also a Mass Ideological Remolding Movement
    Jilin Province's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, with "five-izations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, continuousization), "double doubling" (equipment renovation, doubling of production capacity), and "three improvements" (improving ideology, technology and culture, and enterprise management level) as its content, is developing in a more extensive and deeper direction. In order to push the movement to a new peak, we must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and strengthen ideological and political work. Like any other work, politics is the commander and soul of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement; ideological work must precede the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.
    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a production movement and also a mass ideological remolding movement. The development process of technical innovation and technical revolution is also a process of ideological struggle. The erroneous thoughts that hinder the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are nothing more than the old set of empiricism, the unrealistic dogmatism, the lack of confidence, and the pessimistic thoughts that only see the shortcomings of new things. And empiricism and the habitual forces of conservatism are the main aspects. The essence of these thoughts is the manifestation of right-leaning conservative thought, and the manifestation of the worldview of cowards and lazy people. If these erroneous thoughts are not eliminated, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will be like a woman with bound feet, swaying and progressing slowly, or even accomplishing nothing. In the technical revolution movement, Jilin Province held high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, organized the workers and people to speak out freely and debate, carried out criticism and self-criticism, broke the "theory of production reaching the top," "the theory of special circumstances," and "the theory of only conditions"; criticized the "mysterious viewpoint" of technology and the "hand-reaching" mentality, broke superstitions, improved the ideological awareness of the masses, enhanced the sense of ownership of the masses, swept away the worldview of cowards and lazy people, promoted the communist style, and boosted greater revolutionary enthusiasm. As a result, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement quickly formed a huge wave, magnificent. Many comrades lived in the workshop and stayed on site in order to make innovations; they devoted themselves to technology and forgot to eat and sleep in order to overcome key problems; the broad masses of people worked selflessly without regard to remuneration. Many "amateur factories" and "amateur design groups" appeared in the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and thousands of people participated in voluntary labor. Helping each other and promoting each other, "giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself" has become a new moral fashion. This communist spirit of the workers and people is priceless. This is the true meaning of "ideology is red, innovation is even redder," just as a worker's poem says: "Work hard and forget to eat and sleep, not afraid of the difficulty of forming a complete set, if you want a great technical revolution, ideology must be both red and expert."
    People are the decisive factor in promoting technological progress and production development. The greater the change in people's mental outlook, the more revolutionary enthusiasm there will be, and the faster the development of production technology will be. Therefore, in the technical revolution movement, we must do a good job in the political and ideological education of the masses, educate the masses with the communist ideology of "everyone for me, me for everyone," and constantly improve the ideological awareness of the masses, establish a communist attitude towards labor, so as to promote the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. We cannot educate the masses with the idea of ​​one-sided material incentives. Because only one-sidedly emphasizing material incentives will numb people's minds and lead to the bad consequences of developing individualism and economism. We should correctly combine the principles of political education and material encouragement, first political education, and then material encouragement. Of course, we cannot deny the individual's material interests, but put the individual's interests in the collective interests, and the individual's interests must obey the collective interests, and the current interests must obey the long-term interests. We must educate the masses to have lofty ideals, always be full of vigor, ambition, and work hard. Lenin said: Materialists are the most "idealistic," the most hard-working, the most fearless of death, and cannot be bought with money, because they have ideals, and their eyes are always forward. Lenin's words are worth remembering forever.
    Experience has proved that if we firmly grasp political and ideological work, and at the same time care about the lives of the masses and cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, then the contradictions between new things and conservative ideas, the contradictions between individualism and collectivism, and the contradictions between advanced and backward that occur in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement can be continuously overcome. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "The working class should transform the entire society in the class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself." (On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People)
    Starting from Reality and Adhering to Walking on Two Legs
    In order to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new peak, we must proceed from reality and adhere to the policy of walking on two legs. We must determine the focus of reform based on the specific conditions of different regions and different enterprises, and concentrate our efforts to solve them. At present, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, focusing on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual labor and heavy physical labor. Judging from the situation in Jilin Province, there is still a large amount of manual labor in the lifting, handling, mining, crushing, construction, packaging, forging, casting, riveting, and fitter trades, and in the brewing, tanning, shoemaking, catering, and other service industries. Therefore, we must take active measures to gradually mechanize or semi-mechanize manual operations. Of course, enterprises with a high level of mechanization or that have already been mechanized should also actively develop towards automation or semi-automation. In other words, both new, old, large, and small enterprises must improve step by step on the existing basis in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution, and gradually develop from low-level to high-level, so as to achieve the goal of saving labor, improving labor productivity and production capacity, and building socialism at a high speed. At the same time, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs and running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The modification or manufacture of equipment should be both indigenous and foreign. If it can be foreign, it should be foreign; if it cannot be foreign, it should be indigenous. It should be gradually improved from indigenous to foreign. We must emphasize relying on the masses, self-reliance as the main thing, and striving for foreign aid as the supplement, using local materials, using waste materials, making do with what is available, spending less money, doing more things, and even doing things without spending money.
    Adapt to the Development of Productive Forces and Continuously Adjust Production Relations
    In order to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new peak, we must also pay attention to continuously adjusting production relations and continuously adapting the superstructure to the developing economic base.
    At present, the management work and the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in factories and mines are generally compatible, but there are also incompatibilities. The reason why it is said to be compatible is that the continuous improvement of the level of enterprise management has promoted the continuous development of technical innovation and technical revolution movement and the continuous development of productive forces; the reason why it is said that there are still incompatibilities is that the development of the mass movement will inevitably break the old production order and require the establishment of a new production order, requiring further improvement of enterprise management work.
    This situation is not surprising at all, which is precisely where the superiority of the socialist system lies. Our task is to discover this incompatible situation in a timely manner and solve it in a timely manner. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "After the mass movement develops, it will destroy some of the original production order. However, what it destroys is the old order that is not conducive to the development of production, and at the same time, it establishes a new order that is conducive to the development of production. In 1958, through the mass movement, we adjusted the relationship between people in enterprises, implemented the system of workers participating in management and cadres participating in labor, and implemented the system of close combination of leading cadres, workers, engineering and technical personnel, and management personnel under the leadership of the Party committee, and at the same time, with leadership, we reformed the unreasonable rules and regulations, which greatly improved the management level and production level of enterprises. The socialist system is not a static and solidified thing. To change the old order with leadership and establish a new order is to fully exert and develop the superiority of the socialist system. And to do this, we must rely on the masses of the people, fight against all traditional habits that restrict the development of productive forces, and continuously adjust production relations and the superstructure so that they meet the needs of the development of social productive forces. As long as we do this, we will be able to promote the rapid development of technical innovation and technical revolution, promote the rapid development of social productive forces in our country, and maintain the continuous leap forward of the national economy." (The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China)
    The central issue of improving enterprise management now is to strengthen the leadership of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, combine centralized leadership with vigorous mass movement, and combine the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with production. This first requires us to conduct overall planning. The purpose of overall planning is to make the leaders have a bottom line in their hearts and the masses have a clear understanding. This requires us to grasp the current focus in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution and the stage theory of revolutionary development, to make long-term plans and short-term arrangements, not only to grasp the current focus, but also to look further ahead, and to prepare for the next step as soon as we take the first step, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has not only clear and far-reaching goals, but also practical principles, policies, and specific measures; the planning must follow the mass line, explain the situation to the workers and people, explain the tasks, point out the direction, mobilize the masses to fully discuss, propose projects, propose measures, concentrate them, and then implement them, assign people and projects, and implement them at all levels. We must also continuously revise the plan according to the development of the movement and propose new innovation topics. The second is to use the method of production "great battle" to organize the masses to realize the plan. The so-called production "great battle" is to review the work in a period, exchange experiences, organize competitions; concentrate the wisdom of the masses, encircle and annihilate the key; expose contradictions, strengthen new weak links, conduct comprehensive balance, make new overall arrangements, incorporate scattered and partial activities into a "chess game," and promote the overall development of the movement. After the battle, there is generally a period of rest and recuperation, summarizing experience, talking about ideas, improving management, and preparing ideologically, organizationally, technically, and materially for the next step. Therefore, each battle is a triple harvest of production, technology, and ideology. This is in line with the law of the mass movement rising and falling.
    Consolidate and Improve the System of "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations"
    Another important aspect of improving enterprise management is to continue to consolidate and improve the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." With the development of technical innovation and technical revolution, the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" has also undergone new developments.
    Regarding "two participations": Leading cadres participating in labor and studying problems with workers and breaking through key problems together has become a habit, which is one of the characteristics of China's socialist enterprise management; the experience of workers participating in management has also become richer, and the participation of workers in management has formed a system that "cannot be disrupted." At present, the characteristics of workers' participation in management are three: First, almost all members of the group participate in management work, and participate in the management of all work of the enterprise, including design work, which reflects the broadest mass base of socialist enterprise management; second, the workers' management group is an administrative grassroots organization, which relies on collective leadership and methods of persuasion and education and the mass line to carry out work, not simply relying on administrative orders to carry out work. Many factory management groups have also established a leading group composed of leading cadres and activists from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to uniformly arrange tasks and arrange activities; third, ensuring the absolute leadership of the Party, workers' management is carried out on the basis of democracy and under centralized guidance. This system of workers' participation in management has further demonstrated its powerful vitality in the current mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. Practice has proved that the workers' management group has become the link between the Party and the masses, the capable assistant of administrative management, the field for workers to learn enterprise management, and the school for enterprises to train cadres.
    Regarding "one reform": Establishing certain rules and regulations is of course important in enterprise management, and the masses must also be educated to abide by reasonable rules and regulations. However, the rules and regulations in enterprises cannot be immutable, and must be continuously eliminated from various rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces and bind the enthusiasm of the masses with the development of the mass movement, with both destruction and establishment, so that they serve the mass movement and play a role in promoting the development of productive forces and encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses. Judging from the current situation, there are several rules and regulations that must be immediately rectified: The technical management system must be quickly followed up; with the realization of mechanization and automation, the changes in production tools and equipment, the original set of technological procedures cannot be fully adapted. In order to ensure the normal production after technical innovation, it is necessary to revise the old technological procedures or formulate new technological procedures, even if there is a temporary regulation; product inspection and equipment maintenance systems must also take corresponding measures with the development of the movement to ensure the improvement of product quality and ensure the normal operation of equipment, improve equipment utilization, and extend equipment life; the economic accounting system should also be strengthened, and the advanced experience of economic accounting and economic activity analysis in the team must be promoted; because the results of technical innovation and technical revolution will inevitably cause changes in labor organization, it is also necessary to strengthen labor management and properly resettle surplus personnel.
    Regarding "three combinations": The system of "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel has played a huge role in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Many factories have appeared with lively and active organizational forms such as "three combinations" groups, "service teams," and "guidance teams." The role of old workers in the "three combinations" is very significant. They not only participate in various design work, but also participate in scientific research work and march towards cutting-edge technology. They are production practitioners, have rich practical experience, and their participation in innovation activities is often twice the result with half the effort. The vast majority of engineering and technical personnel have also shown great revolutionary enthusiasm in this movement, supporting the suggestions of the masses and working with the workers to research and manufacture. Practical activities have further enriched their knowledge and also strengthened their connection with the masses. With the help of technical personnel, workers have also improved their scientific and technological and theoretical level. At the same time, the "three combinations" within the factory have also developed outside the factory, "linked" with scientific research institutions and universities. Many scientists, researchers, professors, lecturers, and students have gone deep into production, deep into reality, and deep into the masses to help study the key technical problems in production and carry out scientific research work on cutting-edge technology. This is the most vivid manifestation of the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants, and the combination of mental workers and manual workers. This is of profound significance in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In addition, this communist style of mutual combination and cooperation inside and outside the factory has also spread to the scope between factories, between industries, and between urban areas. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, mutual support is provided, and cooperation is implemented in terms of technical research, technical strength, and materials and equipment. If one person has something to do, everyone comes to help. If one place is innovative, all parties support it. This communist spirit of cooperation fully embodies the socialist relationship of comradely mutual assistance and cooperation and fully embodies the superiority of the socialist system.
    Timely Summary and Promotion of Advanced Experience
    In order to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new peak, we must also firmly grasp the important link of promoting advanced experience. Make the individual and partial advanced production level quickly become the social production level.
    The history of human society is the history of production. Production is always in a state of development and change. New production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies. Every major creation and invention in production technology often causes a major reform of production technology and causes a huge development of production. Therefore, the various advanced experiences created in the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement are our valuable social wealth. And promoting these advanced experiences is the key to promoting the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, consolidating and expanding the results of the movement, and is also the key to accelerating the development of the socialist construction cause. Therefore, on the one hand, we must actively support all budding new things, help every advanced producer and advanced collective realize their innovation initiatives, and at the same time, we must actively promote their effective advanced experience. In order to effectively promote advanced experience, we must classify and sort out existing experience, summarize and compare it, and after technical appraisal and repeated testing, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and strive for perfection. Such experience, promoted from popularization to improvement, will enable people to avoid detours and achieve great results. Production "great battle," "great supporting," "great cooperation," "great competition," and "great evaluation" are good ways to comprehensively promote advanced experience. The promotion of advanced experience must be realistic and tailored to local conditions, and avoid mechanically copying. It is necessary to combine learning from others' experience with one's own creation, and combine popularization with improvement. Learning and promoting advanced experience is related to the speed of socialist construction. In the promotion of advanced experience, it is necessary to strengthen the education of workers and engineering and technical personnel, especially to make them understand that not only should they respect science and use existing scientific theories to appraise and improve advanced experience, but they can also summarize and develop and even create new scientific theories from advanced experience. Constantly overcome ideological obstacles and material and technical difficulties in promoting advanced experience. This is a meticulous and arduous work. Those who travel a hundred miles are half way to ninety. Whether advanced experience can be promoted and whether it can be implemented throughout is also a test for the leaders of each enterprise.
    According to the development of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, it is urgent to summarize and promote the experience of realizing mechanization in mining, raw material industry, and transportation, because the proportion of manual operations and heavy physical labor in these departments is very large, and they are also weak links in the current national economic development. Accelerating the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization in these departments is of great significance to the in-depth development of the entire technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and is also of great significance to the comprehensive leap forward of the entire national economy.
    In addition, in the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, summarizing and promoting the experience of comprehensive utilization is worthy of our special attention. Comprehensive utilization is an important part of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Comprehensive utilization can not only make the best use of everything and solve the problem of insufficient raw materials and materials, but also create more wealth for the country. Judging from the situation in Jilin, the potential for comprehensive utilization in the forest industry and the chemical industry is very large. Many factories in these industries have in fact developed in the direction of joint enterprises or comprehensive factories for comprehensive utilization. Therefore, on the one hand, we must promote the experience in scientific research on comprehensive utilization, and on the other hand, we must summarize and promote the experience in running small joint enterprises or comprehensive factories, which will play a major role in the development of the national economy.
    Cultural Revolution Must Be Carried Out at the Same Time
    In order to adapt to the needs of the current technical innovation and technical revolution, a cultural revolution must be carried out at the same time. At present, what hinders the development of productive forces in our country is technical backwardness and cultural backwardness. To make productive forces further develop, we must have both technology and culture. While carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must launch a upsurge in learning culture and learning science and technology, so that the broad masses of workers can master the weapons to overcome all scientific and technological fortresses, so as to accelerate the process of technical revolution and quickly realize the tasks in technical transformation.
    In fact, in the development process of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the broad masses of workers have a very urgent demand for learning culture and learning technology. In many enterprises, a upsurge in learning culture and learning technology has been formed. In order to adapt to the requirements of the new situation of the technical revolution, the Jilin Chemical Company put forward the slogan of "scientific research forming a network and education forming a system." According to the policy of education serving the proletariat, education combining with production, and factories running schools, they adopted the method of running schools at three levels of the company, factory, and workshop; adopted the form of combining amateur education and formal education, combining long-term education and crash education, and combining political education and technical and cultural education, forming a complete education system in the entire enterprise. They followed the principle of "combining production, teaching according to aptitude, and being flexible and diverse" to run 96 spare-time schools from primary school to university. In addition, they also run a set of formal schools from primary school to university. The two sets of educational organizations train talents together. In addition, they also held Marxist-Leninist self-study classes to enable cadres to systematically study Mao Zedong's works. In recent years, the average cultural level of all employees of the company has been raised from the level of senior primary school to the level of junior high school, and a large number of talents have been trained for the country. At the same time, they have also widely carried out mass scientific research work, realizing the plan of "scientific research forming a network." Combining the research work of scientific research institutions with the mass research work. Everyone is doing experiments and research everywhere. Scientific research work has formed a large-scale mass movement. At present, the company already has 879 scientific research groups, including 6,249 employees. They plan to reach 1,000 groups and 10,000 people in 1960. This is really an exciting idea.
    The fact that the Jilin Chemical Company runs schools on a large scale and carries out mass scientific research work tells us that it is not only necessary but also possible to run vocational and spare-time education for employees on a large scale in enterprises, vigorously popularize scientific and cultural knowledge, and appropriately run higher education on the basis of popularization; and carrying out mass scientific research work and combining the research work of scientific research institutions with the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is the basic way to rapidly improve the level of science and technology, strengthen the scientific research team, and march towards cutting-edge technology. It can be seen that the policy of "one main, two secondary, and three combinations" put forward by the Party Central Committee is completely correct. Factories run schools on a large scale, being both factories and schools, producing both products and talents. This is the direction to achieve the task of cultural revolution more, faster, better, and more economically. While carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must do everything possible to take various measures to continuously improve the cultural level of the workers, popularize scientific and technological knowledge, and widely carry out the movement to study Mao Zedong's works and popularize the education of Marxist-Leninist theory. In this way, we can train the working class of our country into a strong contingent with consciousness, discipline, and scientific and cultural knowledge, climb to the peak of world science, culture, and technology, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible, and move towards a communist society.

    把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高峰
    中共吉林省委第一书记　吴德
    在我国国民经济持续跃进中，技术革新和技术革命运动已经进入了一个新阶段，这是我国社会主义建设新阶段的重要内容之一。就吉林省的情况看来，技术革新和技术革命运动的新发展，主要表现在以下几方面：运动的声势浩大，具有全民性的规模，广大职工群众表现了高度的自觉性和大胆首创精神，出现了像1958年全民大炼钢铁那样的沸腾景象。技术革新的内容从简单地革新操作方法、生产工具，发展到革新整个工艺过程，改变产品设计，改造全部设备结构，进而形成了整个企业，整个行业有计划有领导地大规模地全面技术改造的潮流。运动中发展了比、学、赶、帮的社会主义竞赛的经验，先进经验由分散的单项的进而按行业配套成龙，全面推广；运动中不少企业在采用新技术、尖端技术、创制新产品和尖端产品方面也有了相当的进展。群众性的科学技术研究工作十分活跃，同时大搞综合利用，进一步充实了技术革新和技术革命的内容。在运动的领导方面，出现了“上下一齐动，大小一齐抓，土洋一齐搞”，集中领导和大搞群众运动紧密结合的新形势，因而运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。
    生产技术水平大大提高
    技术革新和技术革命运动，促进了生产力进一步的发展，促进了生产技术水平的大大提高，同时也促使人们的精神状态都发生了深刻的变化。吉林省在近三个月来出现了成百上千条自动生产线和连续生产线，全省国民经济各部门机械化、自动化的水平显著提高。工业方面从事手工劳动的工人从年初的61．8％，降低为53．8％，已有几万人丢掉了斧头，扔下了大锤，放下了铁锹，甩掉了垫肩，从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，从而改变了某些部门的生产技术面貌。由于生产技术上的变革，节省了大量的劳动力、大量的设备和投资，大大提高了劳动生产率，像长春第一汽车制造厂和吉林化学公司染料厂都已实现了一厂变三厂的计划那样，“一人顶一帮，一机顶数机，一厂顶数厂”的设备翻新、生产翻番的现象成了普遍的趋势，因而超额完成了1、2月份发展国民经济的计划。同时，由于劳动条件的改善，职工群众喜气洋洋，他们歌颂技术革命，歌颂共产党。一首搬运工人的诗中写道：“过去搬运用双肩，汗流满面腰腿酸，干劲虽足效率低，有时车间原料断；如今实现连续线，工人个个笑开颜，节省人力一百六，效率提高八倍半。”辽源市工人说：“党的领导真正好，技术革命是个宝，人人动手又动脑，手工操作不见了；土法生产搞机器，产量、质量大提高。”显然，由于技术革新和技术革命运动深入发展而引起的一系列的变化，是具有重大的经济意义和政治意义的。因为技术的不断进步，劳动生产率的迅速提高，生产力的飞跃发展，必将加速我国社会主义建设事业的进程，从而迅速地改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。正如毛主席所指出的：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”（关于农业合作化问题）
    技术革新和技术革命运动的新形势的出现不是偶然的。这是由于党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动深入人心，广大职工群众迫切要求改变我国“一穷二白”的状况，强烈地期望以更高的速度建设社会主义；由于党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的伟大号召；由于国民经济持续地跃进、第二个五年计划主要指标提前三年完成，和十年赶上英国的口号的鼓舞；由于反右整风和社会主义教育运动的激励，因而调动了一切积极因素。在毛泽东思想指导下，广大职工群众破除了迷信，解放了思想，意气风发，斗志昂扬，涌现出创造历史的无穷无尽的力量和智慧。“劲添劲，巧加巧，闹革新，争分秒”；“愚公移山嫌太慢，要学二郎把山担。”这些豪言壮语，充分显示了他们的宏图大志和英雄气概。这种革命的精神状态就产生了一股强大的热力，推动技术革新和技术革命运动的波涛，滚滚向前。在我们祖国这张洁白的纸上绘出了美丽的图画，写下了动人的诗篇。
    是生产运动也是群众自我改造的思想运动
    吉林省的技术革新和技术革命运动以“五化”、（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、连续化）“双翻”（设备翻新、生产能力翻番）、“三提高”（提高思想、技术和文化、企业管理水平）为内容，正向更加广泛，更加深入的方向发展。为了把运动推向新的高峰，我们必须高举毛泽东思想的红旗，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，加强思想工作和政治工作。像任何其他工作一样，政治是技术革新和技术革命运动的统帅和灵魂；技术革新和技术革命运动必须思想工作先行。
    技术革新和技术革命运动是生产运动，也是群众自我改造的思想运动，技术革新和技术革命的发展过程也是思想斗争过程。妨碍技术革新和技术革命运动发展的错误思想，不外是老一套的经验主义，脱离实际的教条主义，缺乏信心的自卑感，以及对待新生事物光看缺点，这也不是，那也不行的悲观思潮。而经验主义，因循守旧的习惯势力是主要方面。这些思想实质上都是右倾保守思想的表现，都是懦夫、懒汉的世界观的表现。这些错误思想如果不加以清除，技术革新和技术革命运动就会如同小脚女人走路一样，摇摇摆摆，进展迟缓，乃至一事无成。吉林省在技术革命运动中，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，组织职工群众的鸣放辩论，开展批评和自我批评，打破了“生产到顶论”、“情况特殊论”、“唯条件论”；批判了技术“神秘观点”和“伸手派”思想，破除了迷信，提高了群众的思想觉悟，增强了群众主人翁的感觉，横扫懦夫、懒汉的世界观，发扬了共产主义风格，鼓起了更大的革命干劲，结果是技术革新和技术革命运动迅即形成巨浪，波澜壮阔。许多同志为了闹革新，住在车间，宿在现场；为了攻关键，钻技术，废寝忘食；广大群众不计报酬，忘我的劳动。长春第一汽车制造厂就出现了许多“业余工厂”、“业余设计组”，数以千计的人参加义务劳动。互相帮助，互相促进，“把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己”成了一种新的道德风尚。职工群众这种共产主义精神是千金难买的。这才是“思想红，革新更红”，正像一首工人的诗所说：“废寝忘食苦钻研，不怕成龙配套难，若想技术大革命，思想必须红又专”。
    人是推动技术进步、生产发展的决定因素。人的精神面貌的变化越大，革命干劲就越足，生产技术的发展就越快，因此在技术革命运动中必须做好对群众的政治思想教育工作，要以“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义思想教育群众，不断提高群众的思想觉悟程度，树立共产主义劳动态度，从而推动技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。不能以片面物质刺激的思想去教育群众。因为，只片面地强调物质刺激，就会麻痹人们的思想，导致发展个人主义和经济主义思想的恶果。应当把政治教育和物质鼓励的原则正确地结合起来，首先是政治教育，其次才是物质鼓励。当然，不能否认个人的物质利益，而是把个人利益放在集体利益之中，个人利益必须服从集体利益，目前利益必须服从长远利益。要教育群众有远大理想，永远朝气蓬勃，壮志满怀，埋头苦干，列宁说：唯物论者是最“唯心的”，最刻苦的，最不怕死的，拿钱不能收买的，原因是他们是有理想的，任何时候眼睛都是向前的。列宁这句话是值得我们永远记取的。
    经验证明：如果紧紧抓住政治思想工作，同时关心群众生活，爱护群众的积极性，那么在技术革新和技术革命运动中发生的新生事物和因循守旧思想的矛盾，个人主义和集体主义的矛盾，先进与落后的矛盾，就能不断得到克服。正如毛主席所指出的“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”（关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题）从实际出发坚持两条腿走路
    为了把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高峰，必须从实际出发，坚持两条腿走路的方针。要根据不同地区，不同企业的具体情况，实事求是地确定改革的重点，集中力量加以解决。目前，技术革新和技术革命运动是以机械化、半机械化为中心，着重变革手工劳动和笨重体力劳动的机械化、半机械化。就吉林省情况来看，在起重、运搬、采掘、破碎、建筑、包装、锻、铸、铆、钳几个工种，和酿酒、制革、制鞋、饮食业及其他一些服务行业中，还大量的存在着手工劳动，因此必须积极采取措施，使手工操作逐步机械化或半机械化。当然，在机械化水平较高或已经机械化了的企业，也要积极向自动化或半自动化发展，换句话说，就是无论新、旧、大、小企业都要根据不断革命精神，在现有基础上提高一步，逐步地由低级往高级方向发展，从而达到节省劳动力，提高劳动生产率和生产能力，高速度建设社会主义的目的。同时，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，必须坚决贯彻两条腿走路和勤俭办企业的方针，设备的修改或制造，应该土洋并举，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，由土到洋，逐步提高。必须强调依靠群众，自力更生为主，争取外援为辅，就地取材，利用废料，因陋就简，少花钱，多办事，甚至不花钱也能办事。
    适应生产力的发展　不断调整生产关系
    为了把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高峰，还要注意不断调整生产关系，不断使上层建筑适应于发展中的经济基础。
    目前，厂矿企业中的管理工作和技术革新、技术革命的群众运动，整个来说是相适应的，但是又有不相适应之处。所以说是相适应的，是因为企业管理水平的不断提高促进了技术革新和技术革命运动的不断发展和生产力的不断发展；所以说还有不相适应之处，是因为群众运动的发展必然会又冲破旧的生产秩序，要求建立新的生产秩序，要求企业管理工作的进一步改善。
    这种状况丝毫也不值得奇怪，这正是社会主义制度优越性的所在。我们的任务就是要及时地发现这种不相适应的状况，及时地加以解决。刘少奇同志说：“群众运动发展起来以后，是会要破坏一些原有的生产秩序的。但是，它所破坏的是不利于生产发展的旧秩序，而在同时又建立了有利于生产发展的新秩序。在一九五八年，我们通过群众运动，在企业中调整了人与人之间的关系，实行了工人参加管理、干部参加劳动的制度，实行了领导干部、工人、工程技术人员和管理人员几方面在党委领导下密切结合的制度，同时有领导地改革了不合理的规章制度，结果就大大地提高了企业的管理水平和生产水平。社会主义制度不是一成不变的凝固的东西。有领导地改变旧秩序，建立新秩序，就是充分发挥和发展社会主义制度的优越性。而要这样做，就要依靠人民群众，同一切束缚生产力发展的传统的习惯势力作斗争，不断地调整生产关系和上层建筑，使之适合社会生产力发展的需要。只要我们这样做，就能够推动技术革新和技术革命的迅速发展，就能够推动我国社会生产力的迅速发展，就能够保持国民经济的持续跃进。”（马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利）
    现在改进企业管理的中心问题是加强对技术革新和技术革命群众运动的领导，使集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合，使技术革新和技术革命运动同生产相结合。这就首先要求我们进行全面规划。全面规划的目的是为了使得领导心中有底，群众心中有数。这就要根据不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论的精神，长计划，短安排，既要抓住当前的重点，又要看得更远，走第一步，就要为下一步作准备，使技术革新和技术革命运动既有明确远大的奋斗目标，又有切合实际的方针、政策和具体的措施；订规划必须走群众路线，向职工群众讲清形势，交代任务，指明方向，发动群众充分讨论，拟订项目，提出措施，集中起来再贯彻下去，按人按项目，层层落实。还要根据运动发展的情况不断修订规划，提出新的革新课题。其次是运用生产“大会战”的方法去组织群众实现规划。所谓生产“大会战”，就是把一个时期内的工作进行检阅，交流经验，组织竞赛；集中群众智慧，围歼关键；暴露矛盾，加强新的薄弱环节，进行综合平衡，作新的全面安排，把分散的、局部的活动，纳入“一盘棋”内，推动运动全面开展。会战后，一般要有一段休整时期，总结经验，漫谈思想，改进管理，又为下一步做好思想上、组织上、技术上和物质上的准备工作，因而每次会战都是生产、技术、思想三丰收。这是符合群众运动一起一伏的规律的。
    巩固和健全“两参一改三结合”的制度
    改进企业管理的另一个重要方面，是要继续巩固和健全“两参一改三结合”的制度。随着技术革新和技术革命的发展，“两参一改三结合”的制度也有了新的发展。
    关于“两参”：领导干部参加劳动，和工人共同研究问题、一起突破关键已经成了习惯，这是我国社会主义企业管理的特色之一；工人参加管理的经验也更加丰富起来，工人参加管理已经形成“打不乱”的制度。目前工人参加管理的特点有三：一是几乎所有的小组成员都参加了管理工作，而且参加了包括设计工作在内的企业所有工作的管理，这就体现了社会主义企业管理最广泛的群众基础；二是工人管理小组是行政基础组织，它是依靠集体领导和说服教育、群众路线的方法进行工作，不是单纯依靠行政命令进行工作。许多工厂管理小组还建立了包括党、行政、工会和共青团的小组领导干部和积极分子组成的领导小组，统一布置任务，安排活动；三是保证了党的绝对领导，工人管理是在民主的基础之上和集中的指导之下进行的。这种工人参加管理的制度，在目前开展的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，进一步显示了它的强大的生命力。实际证明，工人管理小组已经成为党联系群众的引带，行政管理的得力助手，工人学习企业管理的园地和企业培养干部的学校。
    关于“一改”：建立一定的规章制度，在企业管理中当然是重要的，也必须教育群众遵守合理的规章制度。但是企业中的规章制度不能是一成不变的，要随着群众运动的发展，不断消除各种规章制度中妨碍生产力发展，束缚群众积极性的种种缺陷，有破有立，使之服务于群众运动，发挥促进生产力发展，鼓舞群众积极性的作用。就目前的情况看来，有几种规章制度必须立即着手加以整顿：技术管理制度必须迅速跟上去；随着机械化、自动化的实现，生产工具和设备的改变，原有的一套工艺规程已不能完全相适应，为了保证技术革新后正常投入生产，就必须修订旧的工艺规程或者制订新的工艺规程，即使有个临时规定也好；产品检验，设备维修制度也必须随着运动的发展采取相应的措施，以保证产品质量的提高和保证设备的正常运转，提高设备利用率，延长设备寿命；经济核算制也要加强，必须推广班组经济核算和经济活动分析的先进经验；由于技术革新和技术革命的结果必然要引起劳动组织的变化，因此还要加强劳动管理工作，妥善安置多余人员。
    关于“三结合”：领导干部、工人、工程技术人员“三结合”的制度，在技术革新和技术革命运动中发挥了巨大作用，许多工厂出现了“三结合”小组、“服务队”、“辅导队”等生动活泼的组织形式，在“三结合”中老工人的作用十分显著，他们不仅参加各种设计工作，而且参加了科学研究工作，向尖端技术进军，他们是生产实践者，有丰富的实际经验，有他们参加的革新活动常常是事半功倍。绝大多数工程技术人员在这次运动中也表现了极大的革命热情，支持群众的建议，并和工人一起研究、制造，实践活动进一步丰富了他们的知识，也密切了他们和群众的联系。由于技术人员的帮助，工人也提高了科学技术和理论水平。同时，厂内的“三结合”又发展到厂外，和科学研究机关、大专学校“挂钩”，许多科学家、研究员、教授、讲师和学生，深入生产、深入实际、深入群众，帮助研究生产中的技术关键问题和进行尖端技术的科学研究工作，这是知识分子和工农群众相结合，脑力劳动者和体力劳动者相结合的最生动的表现。这在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中是具有深刻意义的。此外，这种厂内厂外相互结合、相互协作的共产主义风格，还普遍到厂与厂之间、行业与行业之间，和市区之间的范围。在技术革新和技术革命运动中相互支援，在技术研究方面、技术力量方面、物资器材方面实行协作。一人有事，众人来帮，一处革新，四方支援，这种共产主义协作之风，充分体现了社会主义的同志式的互助合作的关系，充分体现了社会主义制度的优越性。
    及时总结和推广先进经验
    为了把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高峰，还要狠抓推广先进经验这个重要的环节。使个别的、局部的先进生产水平迅速变为社会的生产水平。
    人类社会的历史就是生产的历史，生产永远是处在发展变动的状态中，新的生产技术不断的代替旧的生产技术，生产技术上每一个重大的创造和发明往往引起生产技术的重大改革，引起生产的巨大发展。因此，当前技术革新和技术革命运动中所创造的各种先进经验，是我们的宝贵的社会财富。而推广这些先进经验，是推动技术革新和技术革命运动深入发展，巩固和扩大运动的成果的关键，也是加速社会主义建设事业发展的关键。所以，我们一方面要积极支持一切萌芽的新生事物，帮助每一个先进生产者和先进集体实现他们的革新倡议，同时，更要积极推广他们所创造的行之有效的先进经验。为了有效地推广先进经验，就要对现有经验分类排队，归纳比较，经过技术鉴定和反复的试验，取长补短，精益求精，配套成龙，这种由普及而提高的经验，推广出去，就会使人少走弯路而收到很大效果。生产“大会战”、“大配套”、“大协作”、“大竞赛”、“大评比”，是全面推广先进经验的好办法。推广先进经验一定要实事求是，因地制宜，切忌生搬硬套，要把学习别人的经验和自己的创造相结合，把普及与提高相结合。学习和推广先进经验是关系到社会主义建设速度问题，在推广先进经验中要加强工人和工程技术人员的教育，特别是要他们懂得，不仅要尊重科学，用现有的科学理论去鉴定和提高先进经验，而且可以从先进经验中总结和发展乃至创造新的科学理论。不断克服推广先进经验中的思想上的障碍和物质、技术上的困难。这是一件细致而又艰巨的工作，行百里者半九十，先进经验能否推广，能否贯彻始终，对于每个企业的领导者来说也是一种考验。
    根据当前技术革新和技术革命运动的发展情况，亟需总结和推广采矿原料工业交通运输方面实现机械化的经验，因为这些部门手工操作和笨重体力劳动的比重很大，而且又是当前国民经济发展中的薄弱环节。加快实现这些部门的机械化和半机械化，对整个技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展有重大意义，对整个国民经济的全面跃进也有重大意义。
    此外，在当前技术革新和技术革命运动中，总结和推广综合利用的经验，是值得我们特别重视的，综合利用是技术革新和技术革命运动的一个重要内容。综合利用不仅可以物尽其用，解决某些原料和材料不足的问题，而且可以为国家创造更多的财富。从吉林的情况看，在森林工业、化学工业等方面综合利用的潜力很大。这些产业中的许多工厂，事实上已经朝着综合利用的联合企业或综合工厂的方向发展。因此，一方面要推广综合利用的科学研究方面的经验，另一方面要总结推广举办小型联合企业或综合工厂的经验，这在国民经济的发展中将发生重大作用。
    文化革命必须同时进行
    为了适应当前技术革新和技术革命的需要，必须同时进行文化革命。目前妨碍我国生产力发展的是技术落后和文化落后，要使生产力进一步发展，就必须既有技术又有文化。必须在开展技术革新和技术革命运动的同时掀起一个学习文化、学习科学技术的热潮，使职工群众掌握攻克一切科学技术堡垒的武器，以便加速技术革命的进程，迅速实现技术改造方面的任务。
    事实上，在技术革新和技术革命运动的发展过程中，广大职工群众学习文化、学习技术的要求是十分迫切的。在不少企业中，学习文化和学习技术的热潮已经形成。吉林化学公司，为着适应技术革命新形势的要求，提出了“科学研究成网，教育成系”的口号，他们根据教育为无产阶级服务，教育与生产结合，工厂办学校的方针，采取公司、工厂、车间三级办学的办法；采取业余教育和正规教育相结合，长期教育和速成教育相结合，政治教育和技术文化教育相结合的办学形式，在全企业中形成了一个完整的教育体系。他们按照“结合生产，因材施教，灵活多样”的原则，办起从小学到大学的业余学校九十六所。另外还办起从小学到大学一套正规学校。两套教育组织一齐培养人材。另外还举办了马克思列宁主义自修班，使干部系统地学习毛泽东著作。几年来，全公司职工的平均文化水平已由高小程度提高到初中程度，为国家培养了大批人材。同时，他们还广泛开展了群众性的科学研究工作，实现了“科学研究成网”的计划。把科学研究机关的研究工作和群众性的研究工作相结合。人人搞试验，处处搞研究，科学研究工作形成了大规模的群众运动。目前全公司已经有八百七十九个科学研究小组，包括六千二百四十九名职工，他们计划1960年要达到千组万人。这真是令人兴奋的设想。
    吉林化学公司大办学校和大搞群众性科学研究工作的事实告诉我们，在企业里大办职工业余教育，大力普及科学文化知识，在普及基础上适当地办高等教育，不仅是必要的而且是可能的；而开展群众性的科学研究工作，把科学研究机关的研究工作和技术革新、技术革命的群众运动相结合，是迅速提高科学技术水平，壮大科学研究的队伍，向尖端技术进军的基本途径。由此可见，党中央提出的“一主二从三结合”的方针是完全正确的。工厂大办学校，既是工厂又是学校，既出产品又出人材，这是多、快、好、省地实现文化革命的任务的方向。在技术革新和技术革命运动开展的同时，千方百计地采取种种措施，不断提高职工群众的文化水平，普及科学技术知识，并且要广泛地开展学习毛泽东著作运动，普及马克思列宁主义理论教育。这样，把我国工人阶级培养成为一支有觉悟有纪律有科学文化知识的强大队伍，攀登世界科学文化技术的高峰，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，并向共产主义社会迈进。　（文内插题是本报编辑加的）
