Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 20th: The Baghdad "People's Unity Newspaper" published on March 2nd on the first page, under the title "Maintaining National Independence and Completing Revolutionary Tasks are Organically Linked to the Issue of Democracy," a statement by Zaki Khairi, a member of the founding committee applying for the establishment of the Iraqi Communist Party (People's Unity Party). The statement elaborated in detail the glorious history and lofty status of the Iraqi Communist Party in the cause of the Iraqi people's struggle for and consolidation of national independence before and after the July 14th Revolution, the immense trust the people have in it, and its firm stance to continue fighting for the cause of the nation and the working class. The statement recounted the process of Zaki Khairi and thirteen others applying for the establishment of the Iraqi Communist Party.

The statement said, "Our application to establish the Iraqi Communist Party precisely reflects a historical reality that has occurred and developed in more than twenty-five years of arduous and bloody struggle. During these years of hardship, Iraqi Communists have waged a heroic struggle against the unjust and reactionary policies imposed on the Iraqi people by imperialism and implemented by its agents. The people know that the Iraqi Communist Party is the conscious and faithful defender of the people's interests, and at no time in its glorious history has it ever withdrawn from the battlefield of struggle. The Iraqi Communist Party stood at the forefront of the unyielding forces in the Iraqi people's liberation battle, which finally achieved victory in the immortal July 14th Revolution."

The statement said, "Since the outbreak of the revolution, Communists, together with other loyal forces among the people, have heroically and resolutely resisted aggression and conspiracies, defended the national regime and the achievements of the people, and spared no sacrifice or effort to complete these noble tasks. In this tenacious struggle full of loyalty, sacrifice, and selflessness, the Iraqi Communist Party has once again proven how it upholds the people's rights and how faithful it is to its duty to liberate and consolidate the independence of the motherland."

The statement continued, "Therefore, it is no accident that the masses of the people view our party with affection and trust. The masses of the people regard our party as a firm patriotic force with a glorious history of struggle and great sacrifices, thereby gloriously earning the trust of the masses and reflecting their aspirations."

The statement pointed out that when the working class and the conscious masses of the people take this attitude towards our party, they understand the true colors of certain separatist and opportunistic groups. These groups have tried in vain to fabricate our party's philosophy and goals or to deviate it from the correct path of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, all these groups have been spurned or purged. It is these historical facts that have given our party this status, and it is the will of the working class and the people that has created the party, making it a patriotic political force that has won the trust and support of the masses.

The statement said, "When we submitted our application for approval for our party to conduct legal activities, we reflected this reality and faithfully embodied the desire of Iraqi Communists to exercise their legitimate right to engage in political activities in accordance with the law. After the dark regime, which has been eliminated, forced our party to conduct secret activities for a full twenty-five years, we then believed that the government's fulfillment of our request was a great honor for the revolution and our new republican era."

The statement said, "Granting a party like ours, which enjoys the deep trust and support of the broad masses of the people, the freedom of political activity is naturally a major national issue, not only in the interests of the working class and the working masses united around our party, but also because doing so is in the interests of defending the independence of the republic and completing the tasks of the revolution, in fact, it is also in the interests of all patriotic classes of the people."

Zaki Khairi then recounted the process of applying for the establishment of the Iraqi Communist Party (People's Unity Party).

The statement said, "When the Law on Associations and Political Parties was promulgated, we had some reservations about this law. However, in order to unite with the national regime and to establish a positive spirit in the relationship between us and it, we did not care about these reprehensible points, and we believed that the problem was not in the provisions of this law, but in guaranteeing the implementation of this law and the people who implement this law. In all cases, what can be expected is the democratic nature of the policies pursued by the government and how the government develops this democratic nature in a way that is beneficial to the people."

"We thus submitted an application to establish our party in accordance with the law, and took care to comply with all the restrictions and conditions required by this law."

The statement said, "However, a few days before the statutory deadline expired, we received a reply from the Ministry of the Interior. These replies were actually aimed at obstructing our legalization."

The statement pointed out that the Ministry of the Interior's response subjected the Law on Associations to its first practical test. We have been subjected to particularly unfair treatment, one of the results of which is to obstruct the Iraqi Communist Party from obtaining the approval of the Ministry of the Interior, thereby undermining the Law on Associations at the beginning of its practical application, while also undermining the fundamental principles of the Constitution. Nevertheless, we accepted the Ministry of the Interior's reply in a spirit of magnanimity and eagerness to cooperate, and we satisfied all the requirements suggested by the Ministry of the Interior. After the Sayeg group was approved under the name of "Communist Party," we took another major step and made a great sacrifice, changing the name of the party. All the history, glory, and sacrifices of our party are inseparable from this name. We did this to prove our positive attitude, to prove our cooperation with the authorities, and to prove our extreme willingness to abide by the law, so as not to allow any excuse that could obstruct the approval of our party to engage in legal activities. But all our positive steps have obviously been treated negatively, subjected to unfair treatment that can be proven by looking at the reasons for rejection put forward by the Ministry of the Interior."

The statement said, "Obviously, approving a political party itself cannot create a political party, let alone create a communist party. If it does not come from the hearts of the people, does not receive the sympathy and support of the people, does not faithfully and sincerely represent the interests of the people, and does not steadfastly abide by the guidance and principles of the highest theory of social development—Marxism-Leninism—it is impossible to become a communist party. Our party is precisely such a party, while that spurned opportunistic group that misappropriated our party's name, history, and glory, and tried its best to obstruct our party from obtaining the right to engage in legal activities, is not."

This is a fact that the people all know. The entire people are unanimous on this point, that is: the application we have submitted in fact and in reality represents the Iraqi Communist Party—its entity, its goals, its history, and its realistic existence as a prominent national force in our country's political life. If the group that was approved under the guise of this party's name, despite its desperate struggles, has repeatedly failed and still failed to meet the minimum statutory number of people to establish a political party, then the number of adult citizens who stand with other true patriotic parties to support our party's application has reached nearly 200,000 to this day. They are all workers, peasants, intellectuals, laborers, and working people from all walks of life."

The statement said, "When we submitted our application to establish a party in accordance with the law, we were merely asking to enjoy the inherent legal rights, just like other loyal national forces. Because giving legitimate political party opportunities will enable Communists and the millions of workers around them to have more appropriate conditions to serve their cause, the cause of all patriotic classes of the people, and will also help them make greater efforts to defend the security and development of the republic, enable them to more effectively do their best to realize the unity of national forces, and obtain the best form of cooperation with the patriotic authorities in the task of struggling to protect the motherland from danger, consolidate our country's independence, and defend our revolutionary achievements."

The statement concluded, "We will test the law again. Because we have the people's consciousness, trust, and support, this has further strengthened our belief in the justice of our current cause and our right to engage in legitimate political party activities. We will always be loyal to our glorious Iraqi working class, always selflessly serve the noble people, and always raise high the banner of Marxism-Leninism in the sky of our beloved motherland."

    维护民族独立和完成革命任务是同民主问题有机地联系一起的
    扎基·赫里就申请成立伊拉克共产党（人民团结党）问题发表的声明
    新华社20日讯　巴格达消息：巴格达“人民团结报”3月2日在第一版在“维护民族独立和完成革命任务是同民主问题有机地联系一起的”标题下，发表了申请成立伊拉克共产党（人民团结党）的建党委员会成员扎基·赫里的一篇声明。声明详细阐述了伊拉克共产党在7月14日革命以前和以后伊拉克人民争取和巩固民族独立的事业中的光荣历史和它的崇高地位，人民对它的巨大信任，以及它将继续为民族和工人阶级的事业而奋斗的坚定立场。声明叙述了扎基·赫里和其他十三人申请成立伊拉克共产党的经过。
    声明说，我们为建立伊拉克共产党而提出的申请正是反映了在二十五年多的艰苦流血斗争中发生和发展了的一个历史现实。在这多年的艰苦岁月里，伊拉克共产党人曾为反对帝国主义强加给伊拉克人民的、它的代理人所执行的不义的反动政策而进行了英勇的斗争。人民都知道，伊拉克共产党是人民利益的有觉悟的忠实保卫者，在它的整个光荣历史的任何一个时期里，它从来没有退出过斗争的战场。伊拉克共产党在伊拉克人民解放战斗中就是这样地站在不屈力量的最前列的，这个斗争终于在不朽的7月14日革命中取得了胜利。
    声明说，自从革命爆发以来，共产党人同人民中的其他忠诚力量一起英勇而果敢地抗御侵略和阴谋，保卫着民族政权和人民所取得的成果，为完成这些崇高任务而不惜牺牲，不惜任何努力。在这个坚韧不拔的充满着忠诚、牺牲和忘我精神的斗争里，伊拉克共产党再次证明它是如何坚持人民权利和如何忠于它对解放和巩固祖国独立事业的职责的。
    声明接着说，“因此，人民群众用亲切和信任的眼光来看待我们党就不是偶然的了。人民群众把我们党看成是一支坚定的爱国力量，它有光荣的斗争历史并作出过巨大的牺牲，从而光荣地博得了人民群众的信任，反映了人民群众的愿望。”
    声明指出，当工人阶级和有觉悟的人民群众对我们党采取这种态度的时候，他们是了解某些分裂主义和机会主义集团的真面目的。这些集团曾经枉费心机地力图假造我们党的哲学和目标或使它离开马克思列宁主义的正确路线。因此，所有这些集团都已被唾弃或被清洗了。正是这些历史事实使我们党有了这样的地位，正是工人阶级和人民的意愿创造了党，使党成了一支荣获群众信任和支持的爱国政治力量。
    声明说，“当我们提出要求批准我们党进行合法活动的申请时，我们反映了这个现实，并且忠实地体现了伊拉克共产党人要求依法从事政治活动的合法权利的愿望。在已被消灭的黑暗政权迫使我们党进行了整整二十五年的秘密活动以后，我们当时认为政府方面满足我们的要求乃是革命和我们新的共和时代的一个莫大的光荣。”
    声明说，给予像我们这样一个深受广大人民信任和支持的党以政治活动的自由权自然是一个重大的国家问题，不仅是符合工人阶级及团结在我党周围的劳动群众的利益，而且也是因为这样做符合保卫共和国独立和完成革命任务的利益，事实上，也即是符合爱国人民各阶级的利益。
    扎基·赫里接着叙述了申请成立伊拉克共产党（人民团结党）的经过。
    声明说，当结社和政党法公布的时候，我们对这一法律有些保留。但是我们为了要同民族政权团结，为了要在我们和它之间关系上确立一种积极精神，我们也就没有在意这些值得指责的地方，我们认为问题不是在于这项法律的条文，而是在于保证贯彻这一法律和执行这项法律的人。在所有情况之下，可以期望的是政府所奉行的政策的民主性以及政府如何使这种民主性向着有利于人民的方面发展。
    我们就这样提出了依法建立我党的申请，并注意遵守所有限制和这一法律所要求的条件。
    声明说，但是在法定期限到期前几天，我们接到了内政部的答复。这些答复实际上它的目的是在于阻挠我们合法化。
    声明指出，内政部给我们的答复使结社法经受了第一次实际考验。我们受到了特殊的不公正的待遇，其结果之一就是阻挠伊拉克共产党获得内政部的批准，从而使结社法在一开始实际运用时就遭受破坏，同时也破坏了宪法基本原则。尽管如此，我们以宽大为怀和渴望合作的精神来接受内政部的答复，我们就满足了内政部建议的各项要求。当萨耶格集团以“共产党”名义被批准之后，我们又采取了一个重大步骤，付出了很大的牺牲，改变了党的名字。我们党所有的历史、光荣和牺牲都是与这名字不可分离的。我们这样做是为了要证明我们所抱的积极态度，证明我们同当局合作，证明我们极愿意遵守法律，不让有任何可以阻挠批准我党从事合法活动的借口。但是我们所有的积极步骤显然受到了消极对待，受到了一看内政部所提出的拒绝理由就可以得到证明的不公平待遇。
    声明说，显而易见，批准政党本身并不能制造出一个政党，更不可能制造出一个共产党来。如果不是出自人民的心，得不到人民的同情和拥护，不忠实地诚挚地代表人民的利益，不坚定不移地遵守最高的社会发展理论——马克思列宁主义理论——的指导和原则，就不可能成为共产党。我们的党正是这样的党，而盗用我党名称、历史、光荣，并竭力阻挠我党取得合法活动权利的那个被唾弃的机会主义集团则否。
    这是人民都知道的一个事实。全体人民对于这一点是无异议的，即：我们所提出的申请在实际上和事实上是代表伊拉克共产党——它的实体、它的目标、它的历史和它作为我国政治生活中一个杰出的民族力量的现实存在的。如果说，假借这个党的名义而被批准了的集团，尽管使尽了绝望的挣扎，但仍连续失败，仍然未能具备建立一个政党的最低法定人数的话，那么，同其他真正的爱国政党站在一起支持我党申请的人截至今天为止已近二十万成年公民。他们都是工人、农民、知识分子、劳动者和各方面的劳动人民。
    声明说，当我们依法提出建党申请时，我们只不过是同其它忠诚的民族力量一样，要求享受固有的法律权利。因为给予合法的政党活动机会将使共产党人和周围的千万劳动者有更多的适当条件，来为他们的事业、为人民所有爱国阶级的事业服务，也将有助于他们为保卫共和国的安全及其发展作出更大的努力，使他们更有效地为实现民族力量的统一尽力，并在使祖国免遭危险、巩固我国独立和保卫我国革命成果的斗争任务中取得同爱国当局合作的最好形式。
    声明最后说，“我们将再度考验法律。由于我们有人民的觉悟、信任和支持，这就更加加强了我们对自己目前的事业的正义性和我们从事合法的政党活动权利的信念。我们将永远忠于我们光荣的伊拉克工人阶级，永远忘我地为高贵的人民服务，永远在亲爱祖国的天空中高高举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜。”
