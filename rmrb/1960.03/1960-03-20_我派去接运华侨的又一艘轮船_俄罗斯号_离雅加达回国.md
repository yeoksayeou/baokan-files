Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th. The ship "Russia," sent by the Chinese government to transport returning overseas Chinese, left Tanjung Priok, Jakarta, this morning for home. On board were 1,200 displaced overseas Chinese from West Java.

Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia; Wu Zhizhi, the Chinese representative to the Joint Committee for the Implementation of the Treaty on Dual Nationality between China and Indonesia; Li Jusheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy and Consul General in Jakarta; and all the counselors and consuls of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General went to the port to see them off. The jubilant overseas Chinese gathered on the deck, singing heartily and shouting slogans such as "Long live the Motherland!", "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!", and "Long live Chairman Mao!".

The overseas Chinese returning on the "Russia" were from Bogor, Cimahi, Karawang, Majalengka, and Cigombong in West Java. They boarded the ship yesterday and were cared for by Consul General Li Jusheng and the staff of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General. When they left the reception center in Jakarta, many overseas Chinese went to see them off.

Before their departure, the displaced overseas Chinese from Majalengka wrote a letter to Ambassador Huang Zhen, the Embassy, the Consulate General, and their fellow overseas Chinese. The letter said, "When we felt that our future was bleak, the motherland summoned us and sent a ship to bring us back home, so that we overseas Chinese who have suffered here can return to the motherland and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. How honored we are!" They also expressed their determination in the letter, saying, "We must work hard to learn from the people of the motherland and contribute all our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland."

    我派去接运华侨的又一艘轮船
    “俄罗斯号”离雅加达回国
    新华社雅加达19日电　中国政府派来接运华侨回国的轮船“俄罗斯号”今天上午离开雅加达的丹绒不碌回国。船上载着来自西爪哇的一千二百名流离失所的华侨。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇、为实施中国和印度尼西亚关于双重国籍问题条约的联合委员会的中国代表伍治之、中国大使馆参赞兼驻雅加达总领事李菊生、中国大使馆和总领事馆的全体参赞和领事都到港口欢送。兴高采烈的侨胞聚集在甲板上尽情歌唱，高呼“祖国万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”和“毛主席万岁！”等口号。
    乘“俄罗斯号”轮船回国的华侨是从西爪哇的茂物、芝马墟、加拉横、马惹拉惹和芝甘比来的。他们是在昨天上船的，他们受到李菊生总领事以及中国大使馆和总领事馆工作人员的照顾。当他们离开雅加达的招待处时，许多侨胞都去欢送他们。
    从马惹拉惹来的那些流离失所的华侨在临别之前曾写给黄镇大使、大使馆、总领事馆和华侨同胞们一封信。信中说，“当我们感到前途渺茫的时候，祖国向我们召唤，并派船来接我们回国，使我们在这里受苦受难的华侨能够返回祖国，参加祖国的社会主义建设。我们是多么光荣啊！”他们在信里还表示决心说，我们一定要努力向祖国人民学习，为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献出全部力量”。
