Our Big Family
Wen Shan

We are about to move. Let's rearrange our lives and organize them properly.

Let us all be comrades-in-arms when we work, and the dearest of siblings in life.

Let all people be completely liberated from trivial housework; let the collective care more about the individual, and the individual care more about the collective.

Let the broken fences of lonely and indifferent individualism be forever demolished from life; let people live in tall and magnificent palaces, from the soul to the body.

Let the remnants of exploitative consciousness and base psychology be washed clean in the hot springs of the communist spirit; let people never despise others, nor look down on themselves.

Let the old saying "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep" become a historical relic, and let Mencius' ideal of "Respecting the elderly of my own family, and extending that respect to the elderly of others; loving the young of my own family, and extending that love to the young of others" become the most common and ordinary reality in life.

Let's go see the house first.

How can we describe the feeling that this scene evokes in our hearts? It's like watching a Soviet movie right after liberation, when beautiful high-rise buildings appeared on the screen – new residences built by the Soviet government for workers. An old grandmother, a little grandson, holding a radio and carrying suitcases, happily moved in. ... The happy life of socialism once strongly touched our hearts, but at that time, we always felt it was far away from us. Considering that in the Soviet Union, from the years when Mayakovsky ate horse meat, "holding two small carrots" and "carrying a few damp, thin pieces of firewood under his arm," "going to his lover's house as a guest," to the time when those movies were made, a full third of a century had passed! Who could have imagined that in just ten years, all of this would appear before our eyes?!

Moreover, soon, such residential areas will "replace" all the old housing in Beijing. And the further we go, the better and more beautiful they will be built. We will turn all the poor and remote areas of the past into prosperous communist residential areas and work areas, and turn "city" and "countryside" into historical terms. A Chilean friend, after visiting our country, said in his article: "All of China is under construction. All socialist countries are under construction... It can even be said that the construction crane has become a symbol of socialism. No one, absolutely no one, can deny that China is engaged in construction. I would say they are actively building, building according to the General Line and the Great Leap Forward method." We are building because the future is ours.

Look! Beneath the broad blue sky of the motherland, please admire these tall and beautiful residences for the workers. Light green, egg-yolk yellow, pink, ochre, what vibrant colors! Look! What artistic shapes, almost like spring clothes carefully made by a clever girl. Small balconies filled with sunshine, large glass windows like bright eyes; department stores and cinemas are nearby; a well-equipped nursery is right next to the residence. ...

I don't want to talk about the many facilities that meet the needs of various family situations; the Party's care for the people is like the sunshine that fills every home—it is designed so well that no residence is not illuminated by the sun. I only hear that the delicate railings made of iron wire on the balcony seem to turn into a kind voice:

"Little baby, grow up happily, our superior system is protecting you, all the good things are yours."

The construction worker comrades are smiling, watching our joyful expressions. These artists who understand the value of their works, we are appreciating their art, and they are appreciating their enthusiastic audience.

The March cold wind carries flying sand, telling us how the comrades who persisted in construction in the severe winter had to work. Now they are smiling and leveling the cement on the steps, not even wearing gloves. I suddenly remembered the great sculptor Rodin, working diligently in a studio without a fire in winter, completely forgetting the severe cold.

We all understand in our hearts what makes us feel warm in the cold wind and makes us laugh in the face of hardship and difficulty. In the cement mortar of these buildings built for the workers is mixed the sweat of our beloved border defense soldiers; it is the brothers on the steel base that gave them their bones; the martyrs who stormed the iron gates of the Winter Palace, and the heroic spirits who will forever stand on the snowy mountains, are surveying the picturesque landscape for which they gave their lives with satisfied hearts, pointing and talking about the rich fruits of victory. We are excited not because of mere material enjoyment, but because we understand that loneliness, displacement, hunger, cold, disease, and all spiritual insults and persecutions have been eradicated from the millennia-long life of the laboring people; because today's scenes are just the "beginning of humanity" in communism! I see that the baby crawling around naked on the kang of a commune member today will be driving a cosmic rocket and soaring into the sky. ...

How wonderful! Our life is full of light and the glory of labor! Everyone consciously and seriously works! Every ounce of strength is contributed to the common happiness of the working people, and contributed to the towering, golden communist mansion.

How big is our home! This whole area is our big family! Our kitchen and dining hall are in the public canteen; the children's cots are in the beautiful nursery; this several hundred meters of open space is our yard... But, after saying all this, we are only talking about our residence, our home—the real home is even bigger: one door is on the west coast of the Pacific, and the other door is east of the Elbe River.

### 我们大家的家

    我们大家的家
    闻山
    我们快要搬家了。让我们把自己的生活，再重新好好地安排，妥善地组织。
    让我们大家，工作时像并肩作战的战友；生活里，是最亲爱的手足兄弟。
    让所有的人从琐碎的家务劳动中彻底解放出来；让集体更关心个人，个人也更关心集体。
    让孤独冷漠的个人主义的破篱笆，从生活中永远拆毁；让人们从心灵到肉体，都居住在高大辉煌的殿宇。
    让剥削意识的残余和卑下的心理，在共产主义精神的温泉中漂洗干净；人永远不贱视别人，也不看轻自己。
    让“各人自扫门前雪”这句古话化为历史陈迹，让孟夫子“老吾老，以及人之老；幼吾幼，以及人之幼”的理想，成为生活中最普遍最平凡的事实。
    先去看看房子吧。
    怎么形容眼前这一片景物在我们心里引起的感觉呢？就像刚解放时看苏联电影，银幕上出现了美丽的高楼大厦——这是苏维埃政府给工人盖的新住宅。老奶奶、小孙子，抱着收音机，提着皮箱，欢天喜地的搬进去。……社会主义的幸福生活，曾经强烈地打动过我们的心，但那时候，总觉得它离我们很远。算算苏联，从玛雅可夫斯基吃马肉，“拿着两个小小的胡萝卜”“腋下夹着几根潮湿的细瘦的木柴”，“到爱人家里去做客”的年月，到演那样的电影，足足过了一个世纪的三分之一！谁能想到，仅仅转眼十年，这一切就在眼前出现？！
    而且不久，这样的住宅区就要将全北京的旧住房“取而代之”。并且越往后，盖的就越好，越加美丽。我们将把所有过去的穷乡僻壤，变成共产主义繁华的居民点和工作区，把“城市”和“乡村”变成历史用语。一位智利朋友在我国参观后回去，他在文章中说：“全中国都在建设着。一切社会主义国家都在建设着，……竟可以说，盖房子的起重机，成了社会主义的标志，没有人，绝对没有人能否认中国正在从事建设，我要说他们是在积极地建设。按照总路线和大跃进的办法建设。”我们建设，因为未来是我们的。
    看呵！在祖国宽朗的蓝天之下，请欣赏这一幢幢高大美丽的劳动者的住宅。浅绿的，鹅黄色的，粉红的，赭石的，多么鲜艳的颜色！看呵！多么富于艺术性的造型，简直就像聪明的姑娘精心制作的春装。一个个盛满阳光的小阳台，一扇扇像明亮的眼睛一样的大玻璃窗；百货公司、电影院，就在邻近；设备齐全的托儿所，紧靠着住宅一旁。……
    我不想去说那许多适合各种情况的家庭需要的设备；党对人的关怀，就像那充满每个家庭的阳光——这里设计得那样好，没有一套不被阳光照耀的住宅。我只听到，那阳台上铁丝织成的精致的栏杆，似乎化做一个慈祥的声音：
  “小宝宝，幸福地成长吧，我们优越的制度在保护着你，一切美好的东西都是你们的。”
    建筑工人同志们微笑着，看着我们欢喜的神态。这些懂得自己的作品的价值的艺术家，我们在欣赏着他们的艺术，他们却在欣赏着自己的热情的观众。
    3月的寒风夹着飞沙，它告诉我们在严冬里坚持建设的同志得怎样工作。现在他们笑容满面地在平整着台阶上的水泥，手套也不戴，我忽然想起伟大的雕刻家罗丹，冬天在不生火的工作室里辛勤地劳动，完全忘记了严寒。
    我们心里都明白，是什么使我们在寒风中感到温暖，使我们在艰苦困难之前欢笑。这一幢幢为劳动者建造的楼房，它的水泥浆里，拌和着我们亲爱的边防军战士的汗水；是钢铁基地上的兄弟，给了它们筋骨；冲进冬宫的铁门的烈士，和永远屹立在雪山上的英灵，正怀着满意的心情，巡视着他们为之献身的如画江山，对着丰盛的胜利果实，指点谈说。我们内心激动，不是因为区区的物质享受，而是因为我们了解：孤苦伶仃，流离失所，饥寒疾苦，和一切精神上的侮辱、迫害，都从劳动人民几千年牛马生活中从根消灭；是因为，今日的种种景象，只不过是共产主义的“人之初”！我看到，今天在公社社员炕头上光着小屁股到处爬的娃娃，将会驾驶着宇宙火箭，凌空飞去。……
    多好啊！我们充满了光明与劳动的荣耀的生活！每一个人都自觉地严肃地工作！每一分力量，都贡献给劳动人民共同的幸福，贡献给高插云霄、金光闪闪的共产主义大厦。
    我们的家有多大啊！这一大片，都是我们大家的家！我们的厨房和膳厅，在公共食堂；孩子的小床，在漂亮的托儿所；这几百米的空地，是我们的院子……可是，上面说来说去，说的还只是我们的住宅，我们的家——真正的家还大着呢：一个门口，在太平洋西岸，另一个门，在易北河以东。
