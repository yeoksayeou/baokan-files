Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th: The "Pravda" today published an international commentary entitled "Victory of the Bandung Spirit," commenting on the results of the Sino-Nepalese talks. The commentary believes that the agreement on border issues signed by the Chinese and Nepalese governments is a new victory for the Bandung Spirit.

    The commentary said that China and Nepal are harmonious neighbors. The friendship between the two countries has a history of more than fifteen centuries. The governments of the two countries have made many efforts to strengthen these ties. Recently, the leaders of the two governments held talks in an extremely friendly atmosphere. In the talks, great attention was paid to the border issues left over from past colonialism, and an agreement on the border issue between the two countries was signed. This agreement is in the interests of both countries.

    The commentary said that according to the unanimous opinion of the Chinese and Nepalese newspapers and the public, the Sino-Nepalese talks are a new milestone in the development of Sino-Nepalese relations.

    The commentary said that two months ago, the Sino-Burmese agreement was also signed in Beijing. The agreement paved the way for a smooth resolution of the border issue between China and Burma. In the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, China and Burma solemnly declared their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, expressed their desire for friendship and peace, and their desire to resolve all disputes through consultation.

    The commentary said that peace-loving people are very satisfied with the results of the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese talks. The achievements of the talks once again prove that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are constantly gaining victory in Asia. The Bandung Spirit has achieved a new victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 27th: "Neues Deutschland" published an article on the 27th commenting on the Sino-Nepalese talks, saying that the Sino-Nepalese talks once again proved the vitality of the Bandung Spirit and proved that the extremely complex problems can be solved by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    The article said that just a few weeks after China and Burma signed an agreement on border issues, the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal also reached an agreement on the border issue between the two countries. The article pointed out that there is no doubt that the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese agreements on border issues are beneficial to both sides.

    The article emphasized that the belief of the Asian people in uniting against the dark forces of imperialism points out the significance of the Sino-Nepalese agreement on border issues to us. Not long ago, Western schadenfreude commentators were still barking that the Bandung Spirit had died, presuming that the problems that had been unresolved for decades would alienate China from its friendly neighbors. The purpose of the Cold War offensive against China was also to politically isolate neutral countries in Southeast Asia from the powerful People's China. However, as in the past, the imperialists miscalculated again.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 28th: The Czechoslovak "Red Right News" today published a commentary by its Beijing correspondent Marek entitled "China and Nepal Set an Example" on the results of the talks between the Chinese and Nepalese governments.

    The commentary said that the three documents signed by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China and Prime Minister Koirala of the Kingdom of Nepal—the Sino-Nepalese Joint Communiqué, the Sino-Nepalese Agreement on the Border Issue between the Two Countries, and the Sino-Nepalese Economic Assistance Agreement—have opened a new stage in the relations between the two countries and become a reliable guarantee for further and more effective cooperation between the two countries.

    The commentary said that the results of the Sino-Nepalese talks will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed by all peace-loving forces in Asia, and it will be regarded as a contribution to world peace and a model for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

    The commentary pointed out that the Joint Communiqué and the Agreement on the Border Issue between the Two Countries completely shattered the slanders and scaremongering spread by those who are unwilling to resolve outstanding international issues peacefully and amicably. Last year, there were such lies as: saying that Chinese troops entered the Nepalese border or were concentrated near the Nepalese border, and so on. The Nepalese government has repeatedly stated that these are all lies.

    The commentary pointed out that shortly after the Sino-Burmese talks on resolving similar issues, the agreement signed between China and Nepal clearly proved that the road to resolving the most complex issues through mutual consultation and friendly negotiations is clear.

    The commentary said that the People's Republic of China provides Nepal with economic assistance in accordance with the signed economic agreement. This assistance is a model of selfless assistance without any political conditions attached, an ironclad proof of the vitality of the Bandung principles, and a vital proof of the idea of Asian solidarity and cooperation.

    The commentary said that following the victorious talks in Beijing, Premier Zhou Enlai will soon visit Nepal and discuss and sign a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries, which will add new glory to the existing Sino-Nepalese agreement.

    中尼两国和睦相处　万隆精神富有活力
    兄弟国家报纸赞扬中尼协定的重大意义
    新华社莫斯科28日电　“真理报”今天发表题为“万隆精神的胜利”的国际评论，评述中国和尼泊尔会谈结果。评论认为，中尼两国政府签订的关于边界问题的协定，是万隆精神新的胜利。
    评论说，中国和尼泊尔是和睦的邻居。两国友谊已有十五多世纪的历史。两国的政府作了许多努力，来加强这些联系。最近，两国政府的领导人在极其友好的气氛中举行了会谈。在会谈中，对于过去殖民主义遗留下来的边界问题给予了很大的注意，并签订了关于两国边界问题的协定，这一协定符合两国的利益。
    评论说，根据中尼两国报刊和公众的一致意见，中尼会谈是发展中尼两国关系的新的里程碑。
    评论说，两个月以前，在北京也签订了中缅协定。协定铺平了顺利解决中缅两国边界问题的道路。在中缅友好和互不侵犯条约中，中缅两国庄严地宣布了尊重彼此的独立、主权和领土完整，表示了友谊和平的愿望，以及用协商的办法解决一切争端问题的愿望。
    评论说，爱好和平的公众对中缅和中尼会谈的结果感到非常满意。会谈的成就再一次证明，和平共处五项原则在亚洲不断获得胜利。万隆精神又获得了新的胜利。
    新华社柏林27日电　“新德意志报”27日发表一篇评中国和尼泊尔会谈的文章说，中尼会谈再次证明了万隆精神的生命力，证明了可以用和平共处五项原则来解决极其复杂的问题。
    文章说，在中缅两国签订关于边界问题的协定后刚刚几个星期，中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国之间也达成了关于两国边界问题的协定。文章指出，毫无疑问，中缅两国和中尼两国关于边界问题的协定，对双方都是有利的。
    文章强调说，亚洲各国人民团结一致反对帝国主义黑暗势力的信念，给我们指出了中尼关于边界问题的协定的意义。不久以前，西方的幸灾乐祸的评论还狂吠万隆精神已经死去了，妄自以为数十年以来悬而未决的问题会使中国与友好的邻国疏远。对中国的冷战攻势的目的也在于使东南亚中立国家在政治上与强大的人民中国隔绝开来。可是，同过去一样，帝国主义者又失算了。
    新华社布拉格28日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”今天以“中国和尼泊尔做出榜样”为题，发表了该报驻北京记者马雷克就中国和尼泊尔两国政府会谈结果所写的评论。
    评论说，中华人民共和国总理周恩来和尼泊尔王国首相柯伊拉腊所签订的三个文件——中尼两国政府联合公报、中尼关于两国边界问题的协定和中尼两国经济援助协定揭开了两国关系的新阶段，成为两国之间进一步更加有效合作的可靠保证。
    评论说，中尼会谈的成果无疑将受到亚洲一切爱好和平力量的热烈欢迎，它将被视作对全世界和平的贡献和不同社会制度国家和平共处的典范。
    评论指出，联合公报和关于两国边界问题的协定彻底粉碎了那些不愿意和平友好地解决悬而未决的国际问题的人所散布的污蔑和恐怖消息。在去年一年中，就出现过这样的谎言：说什么中国部队进入尼泊尔边境或在尼泊尔边境附近集中，等等。尼泊尔政府不只一次的声明也都指出这些都是谎话。
    评论指出，在解决类似问题的中缅会谈之后不久，中尼两国所签订的协定又明显地证明了通过相互协商和友好谈判解决最复杂问题的道路是畅通的。
    评论说，中华人民共和国依照所签订的经济协定提供给尼泊尔以经济援助。这种援助是无私的、不附带任何政治条件的帮助的典范，是万隆原则生命力的铁证，是亚洲各国团结和合作思想富有生命力的铁证。
    评论说，继北京的胜利会谈之后，周恩来总理不久将去尼泊尔访问，并在那里讨论和签订两国之间的和平友好条约，这就会为现有的中尼协定增添新的光辉。
