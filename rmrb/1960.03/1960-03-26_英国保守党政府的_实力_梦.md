From the halls of the British Parliament to the teahouses on the streets of London, people are discussing how much disaster the inhabitants of the British Isles would suffer if a new world war were to break out.

This question has become increasingly urgent and realistic in people's confused and uneasy minds because some American missile bases have been established along the east coast of Britain, and the British government has also announced that it will further increase military spending and devote special attention to the race for rockets and nuclear armaments to support the American "policy of strength."

Since Britain has been acting as America's sidekick for many years, some British people are very familiar with the war intentions of the American government. It is precisely because the United States is far behind the Soviet Union in the development of science, technology, and missiles that the American government is eager to use British territory across the Atlantic as a rocket outpost for nuclear war preparations. A growing number of British people have realized and felt the serious harm that the policies of the United States and British governments will bring to the British people.

The British government openly admitted in its 1957 Defense White Paper that "it is currently impossible to provide sufficient protection to our people so as not to be affected by the consequences of a nuclear weapons attack." More recently, the Secretary of State for Defense also stated in a speech last month that "defense is impossible." He said: "Because we know that if a war breaks out, it will only bring destruction to our country, and complete destruction." In recent parliamentary debates, clear-headed members of parliament also questioned the government, since the government knows that the defense policy cannot guarantee the safety of the people and will instead cause harm to the people, why does the government still implement such a policy? They asked: "Is this horrific, useless, and suicidal policy really necessary?"

But the British government is still trying to justify its policy of strength by using the so-called "threat of Soviet aggression," which forces Britain to adopt this policy of "nuclear deterrence." The recently published British Defense White Paper greatly increased military spending in the name of countering the "Communist military threat." The White Paper shows that Britain's military spending this year will reach a record high of more than 1.6 billion pounds. These expenses will be mainly used to develop missiles and modernize "nuclear forces." The White Paper admits that the British government's "overall defense policy" of implementing the nuclear arms race "has not undergone major changes." It said that while developing the "Blue Water" missile, Britain is studying new weapons for launching long-range nuclear missiles from airplanes or submarines and plans to build nuclear submarines.

While vigorously developing nuclear armaments, Britain is also constantly strengthening conventional weapons as a "necessary supplement to nuclear armaments." When talking about doing so, the British White Paper admits that it is to "help maintain the stability of politically sensitive areas (referring to colonies) for which it (Britain) has special responsibility." This is actually to maintain its colonial interests and suppress the increasingly high tide of national independence movements.

All of this shows that Britain is struggling to follow in the footsteps of the American "policy of strength," trying to maintain its status as a major power in the Western camp at all costs. It is significant that when Britain published its Defense White Paper, there was news that the United States "hoped that Britain would hand over control of its independent nuclear force to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." British authorities said that they "have not considered changing Britain's policy of maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent force." Sir Hailsham, the Lord Privy Seal and Minister for Science and Technology of the British government, also declared that for a long time to come, Britain's share in the Western nuclear deterrent force "is not only an important part, but may also be an indispensable part." Moreover, Britain will "spare no effort" in obtaining the most modern nuclear weapons.

However, the ordinary people of Britain are increasingly dissatisfied with the policy of strengthening arms expansion and war preparation under the guise of anti-Sovietism. The statement of the Political Committee of the British Communist Party pointed out that this "is an absurd action" that has nothing to do with Britain's defense, but is merely the "crazy behavior" of the "cold war planners of nuclear strategy and colonial wars." Even former Defense Minister and right-wing Labor MP Shinwell said: "I don't see that the Russians need war. They have a lot of what they need without having to engage in hostile conflict. Therefore, it seems to me that nuclear strategy no longer has any real value."

In order to uphold the nuclear strategy policy, the British government and its backers are also attempting to cleverly decorate it by boasting about the effectiveness and power of British weapons. In this year's Defense White Paper, regarding the weapons section, it listed eleven types of missiles and twelve types of aircraft that the government is constantly manufacturing. Defense Secretary Watkinson repeatedly boasted: "Britain's nuclear deterrent force is more powerful and important to Western allies than its critics imagine." The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" even gleefully revealed a fierce look, saying: "If Britain has sixty rockets, then it can wipe out all the important centers of the Soviet Union from Arkhangelsk to the Black Sea." Isn't this a bit of an overestimation of one's own capabilities? Thirty British Labor MPs were much more sober in a motion impeaching the government. It said: The nuclear armament policy does not provide defense, but instead endangers Britain to self-destruction.

As for the missile weapons that the government is determined to possess, the situation is also not good. According to the current White Paper, the missile named "Blue Water" a year ago is still at the top of the list of missile weapons that the British government is developing. But unfortunately, this missile, made in imitation of American rockets, inherited all the inferior performance and weaknesses of American rockets. If this weapon is successfully developed, it will be a bulky rocket powered by slow-firing liquid fuel. It must be placed deep underground to ensure safety, thus becoming a fixed target for attack.

Labor's George Wigg said mockingly of this clumsy weapon: "This is something that can only satisfy the primitive instincts of mankind. Every infantryman knows that he always tries to get his head close to the ground because he feels safer that way, although it is not safe. Therefore, putting this thing in a hole is better."

The Secretary of Defense also admitted the poor performance of the "Blue Water" rocket and asked Parliament to give more money and more flexibility to manufacture newer mobile weapons, such as nuclear submarines. However, military experts still do not believe in the effectiveness of launching missiles from underwater by submarines, and the cost of such plans is also extremely expensive.

John Gollan, the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, said in a recent public speech that when 400 million pounds have already been spent on the "Blue Water" missile, and the weapon has become obsolete before it has had time to be launched, "we are now talking about how nuclear submarines will roam the ocean and launch the last desperate blow when Britain turns into a sea of fire. Isn't this madness enough?"

Labor MP George Wigg explained this by saying that since digging holes underground doesn't work, we are now trying to find holes underwater.

The Secretary of Defense himself also emphasized the rapid changes in the field of modern weapons and pointed out the difficulties encountered in keeping up with these changes. People are already wondering how long Britain can avoid stumbling in participating in this competition. In 1948, it was estimated that the cost of developing guided missiles was one million pounds. But the latest estimate is 40 million pounds, which is forty times the original estimate. The development cost of the "Blue Water" missile is estimated to be around 600 million pounds. But this once-darling thing may be thrown into the waste weapon heap before it is made. This is a bottomless pit into which the British government is putting its country. Norman Gibbs, a professor of war history at Oxford University, pointed out in a recent article that Britain will be unable to afford expensive armament programs under modern industrial technology conditions.

However, regarding the huge military spending burden on the British people, the Secretary of Defense has repeatedly tried to prove that this money is well spent. The Secretary of Defense believes that the cost is not too high. He calculated that the average cost of defense borne by each person in the country per week is only the money to buy three packs of cigarettes. But for a working-class family of four, this means that he has to pay the cost of forty-eight packs of cigarettes per month. Considering that British cigarettes are expensive (three to four shillings a pack, equivalent to 1.5 yuan RMB), this amount of money is also very large. The British people retorted and ridiculed, saying that we know that this money will all go up in smoke.

Recently, the British government also wants to force the British people to take out more money to invest in this bottomless pit.

According to reports, it has agreed with the United States to establish so-called early warning radar networks to prevent missile attacks in Yorkshire, northern England, and other places. It is expected that when completed in a few years, it can provide four minutes of warning time.

Labor MP Zilliacus questioned the government, since the government announced that once a war breaks out, it will evacuate 40% to 45% of the population (nearly 12 million people) from highly industrialized areas, how will the government implement this plan with only four minutes of warning time? The government spokesperson was speechless.

From the policies announced by the government, the British people concluded that the British government is mainly concerned with establishing a position of strength in nuclear weapons and conventional weapons so that it can maintain its status as a major power and maintain its colonial rule in the Middle East, Africa, the Far East, and other colonies mentioned in the White Paper, while completely disregarding the safety of the British people. But the British people have used increasingly powerful actions to show their firm opposition to the British government pushing them into the abyss of destruction.

    英国保守党政府的“实力”梦
    彭迪
    从英国的议会大厅起直到伦敦街头巷尾的茶馆里，人们都在纷纷议论着如果一次新的世界大战爆发，居住在不列颠诸岛上的人们，将蒙受多大的灾难。
    这个问题在人们混乱不安的心中所以变得日益迫切和现实，是因为美国的一些导弹基地已沿着英国的东海岸建立起来，而英国政府也宣布将进一步增加军事开支，并特别致力于火箭和核军备的竞赛，以支持美国的“实力政策”。
    由于英国多年来就一直充当着美国的小伙计，一些英国人士对于美国政府的战争意图是十分熟悉的。正是因为美国在科学技术和导弹的发展上面远远地落后于苏联，美国政府才急于利用大西洋彼岸的英国领土作为从事核战争准备的火箭前哨基地。日益众多的英国人士已经体会和感觉到美国和英国政府的政策将给英国人民所带来的严重危害。
    英国政府在1957年的国防白皮书里也曾公开承认过“目前还无法对我国人民提供足够的保护，以便不受核武器攻击的后果的影响”。近些时候，国防国务秘书在上月的一次演说里也曾表示“无法进行防御”。他说：“因为我们知道，如果一旦爆发战争，只会给我国带来破坏，而且是彻底的破坏”。在最近的议会辩论里，头脑清醒的议员们也质问政府，既然政府明知防御政策不能保证国民的安全，而且反而会对人民造成危害，为什么政府还要执行这样的政策呢？他们质问：“这种骇人的、无益的和自杀的政策是否确实必要？”
    但是英国政府仍然企图拿所谓由于苏联的“侵略威胁”因而英国不得不采取这种“核威慑”的政策作借口，为它的实力政策辩护。最近英国政府发表的国防白皮书就是以对付“共产党军事威胁”为名而大大增加军费。白皮书表明今年英国军费将达十六亿多英镑创纪录数字。这些费用将主要用来发展导弹和“核力量”的现代化武器。白皮书承认，英国政府实行核军备竞赛的“总的防御政策没有重大改变”。它说英国在发展“蓝光”导弹的同时，正在研究从飞机或潜水艇发射远程核导弹的新武器，并且打算制造核潜水艇。
    英国在大力发展核军备的同时，也不断加强常规武器作为“对核军备的必要补充”。英国白皮书在谈到这样做的时候承认是为了“帮助维持它（英国）负有特殊责任的政治敏感地区（指殖民地）的稳定”。这实际上就是为了维护它的殖民利益，镇压越来越高涨的民族独立运动。
    这一切说明英国正在步履艰难地追随美国“实力政策”的后尘，不惜一切力量企图维持它在西方阵营中的大国地位。意味深长的是：英国发表国防白皮书的时候，有消息说美国“希望英国把它的独立的核力量的控制权交给北大西洋公约组织”。而英国权威人士表示，他们“没有考虑改变英国保持独立核威慑力量的政策”。英国政府掌玺大臣兼科学建设大臣黑尔什姆爵士也宣称：在今后一个很长的时间里，英国在西方核威慑力量中所占的一份，“不仅仅是一个重要的部分，而且可能是一个不可缺少的部分”。而且英国在取得最现代化的核武器方面将“绝不留情”。
    但是英国的普通人民对于在反苏幌子下加强扩军备战的政策日益不满。英国共产党政治委员会的声明中指出，这“是一种荒谬绝伦的行动”，它同英国的国防毫无关系，而只是“核战略和殖民战争的冷战策划者”的“疯狂行为”。甚至前任国防大臣、右翼工党议员辛威尔也说：“我看不出俄国人需要战争，他们拥有大量所需要的东西而无须进行敌对冲突。因此在我看来，核战略已经不再具有任何真正的价值了”。
    为了坚持核战略政策，英国政府和帮腔者还在借着吹嘘英国武器的效果和威力，企图进行巧妙装饰。今年的国防白皮书有关武器部分中，举出了政府在不断制造中的十一种导弹和十二种类型的飞机。国防大臣沃金森三番五次地吹嘘说：“英国的核威慑力量对西方盟国说来，比它的批评者所想像的更为有力和重要。”保守党的“每日邮报”还洋洋得意地露出一副凶相说：“如果英国拥有六十支火箭，那么，就可以把苏联的从阿尔汉格尔到黑海边的一切重要中心消灭干净。”这不是未免太不自量力了吗？还是三十名英国工党议员在一项弹劾政府的动议中说得清醒得多。它说：核武装政策起不了防御作用，反而有使英国自找灭亡的危险。
    至于政府决心拥有的导弹武器，景况也颇不妙。按照目前的白皮书，一年前英国以“蓝光”命名的导弹在英国政府正在发展着的导弹武器名单中仍然名列前茅。但是不幸的是这一仿造美国火箭制成的导弹却承继了美国火箭的全部低劣性能和弱点。如果这个武器发展成功，它将是一种笨重的、用发火缓慢的液体燃料发动的火箭，它必须深入地置放在地面下以保安全，从而成了受攻击的一个固定靶子。
    工党的乔治·惠格在嘲笑这一笨拙的武器时说：“这是一种只能满足人类原始本能的玩艺。每一个当过步兵的人都懂得，他总是尽量设法把头向地面接近，因为他觉得这样就会比较安全，尽管这也并不安全。因此，把这种东西放在地洞里，是会好一些。”
    国防大臣也承认“蓝光”火箭的性能低劣，并要求议会给予更多的钱和更多灵活性来制造更新式的流动武器，像核潜艇之类。可是军事专家们至今并不相信由潜艇从水面下发射导弹的有效性，另外这类计划的费用也是极端昂贵的。
    英国共产党总书记高兰在最近一次公开演说中曾说，当在“蓝光”导弹上已花了四亿英镑，这个武器还没有来得及发射就已经变得陈旧的时候，“我们现在却又谈论在不列颠变成火海的时候核潜艇怎样漫游大洋并发射出最后的绝望的一击。难道这种疯狂还不够吗？”
    工党议员乔治·惠格对这点解释说，由于在地面下挖洞的办法行不通，我们现在又设法在水面下找洞了。
    国防大臣本人还强调了在现代武器领域中情况变化的迅速，并指出跟上这种变化所遇到的困难。人们已在怀疑，英国在参加这一竞赛中究竟能使自己在多长时间中不跌跤子。在1948年的时候人们估计发展定向导弹的费用是一百万英镑。但是最近的估计则是四千万英镑，也就是四十倍于原来的估计。“蓝光”导弹的发展费用估计在六亿英镑左右。但是这个一度是宠儿的东西在制成以前就可能被丢入废武器堆中。这是英国政府使它的国家落入的一个无底洞。牛津大学的战争史教授诺曼·吉布斯在最近一篇文章中指出，在现代工艺技术条件下英国将无力担负昂贵的军备计划。
    但是，对于压在英国人民身上的巨额军费负担，国防大臣却一再企图证明这笔钱花得很有价值。国防大臣认为代价还不算太高。他计算全国人口每人每周平均负担的国防费用，只有买三包香烟的钱。但对一个四口之家的工人家庭来说，这就意味着他每月就须付出四十八包香烟的代价，如果考虑到英国香烟昂贵（三至四先令一包，合人民币一元五角），这笔钱的数目也就很大。英国人民也反唇相讥说，我们知道这些钱都是要烟消云散了。
    最近，英国政府还想迫令英国人民拿出更多的钱来投进这个无底洞。
    据报道，它已同意和美国在约克郡、北英格兰等地设立所谓预防导弹攻击的早期警报雷达网，预计几年之后完工时，可以给予四分钟的警报时间。
    工党议员齐里亚克斯责问政府说，既然政府宣布一旦战争爆发，将从高度工业化地区撤出40％至45％的人口（几达一千二百万人），如果仅有四分钟警报时间，政府将如何执行这项计划？政府发言人瞠目不能答。
    英国人民从政府宣布的政策中得出结论，英国政府主要关心的是，在核武器和常规武器方面建立实力地位，以便能够保住大国地位，并维持它在中东、非洲、远东以及白皮书上提到的其他殖民地的殖民统治，而对英国人民的安全是完全置于脑后的。但是英国人民已经用日益有力的行动来表明：坚决反对英国政府把他们推向毁灭的深渊。
