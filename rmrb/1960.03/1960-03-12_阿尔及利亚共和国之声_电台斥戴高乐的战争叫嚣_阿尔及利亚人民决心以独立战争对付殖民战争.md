Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 10th: "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio, in a commentary on March 8th on de Gaulle's recent clamoring that France would continue its colonial war in Algeria, pointed out that since de Gaulle had declared war and rejected peace, then "we must answer war with war."

The radio station said that de Gaulle "stated in different tones that the war might last for several years and would end with the victory of the French army." The radio station then pointed out: "De Gaulle sees wishes as facts. In reality, de Gaulle and all the regressive conquest-supporters with him will realize that the French occupation forces in Algeria can never defeat our army. The war waged by the French occupation forces in Algeria will never end in victory. In fierce battles, French officers and soldiers will be wiped out in Algeria. The victory that de Gaulle speaks of will ultimately lead the French army to dig its own grave in Algeria."

The radio station said, "De Gaulle anticipates a long war, and we are not at all surprised by this. We have always said that our war will be long-term and will come at a great cost. We often teach our troops that in order to crush the French's evil actions and achieve freedom and independence in the future, we will fight for generations if necessary." The radio station pointed out that although Algeria is willing to achieve independence through peaceful negotiations, "since de Gaulle has announced war to us, and not peace, and since he has openly exposed his true colors, effective negotiations are no longer possible."

"De Gaulle wants to defeat us, to eliminate us, and he hopes that our people will become slaves. We hope he understands well that we would rather be twelve million corpses than twelve million slaves, and our resistance has no end. Our people are so numerous that we should firmly believe that our cause is sacred."

The radio station also said, "The Algerian people and the Algerian motherland will exist forever." "Our motherland has a glorious past written by its martyrs and heroes. It will cultivate future generations of new people who will take on the same tasks as those who fought in prisons, concentration camps, courts, villages, and mountains in the past, along with soldiers, male and female guerrillas, and the soldiers of the glorious Algerian National Liberation Army, and will deal heavy blows to the enemy."

    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台斥戴高乐的战争叫嚣
    阿尔及利亚人民决心以独立战争对付殖民战争
    新华社10日讯　开罗消息：“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台8日在评论戴高乐最近表示法国要在阿尔及利亚继续进行殖民战争的叫嚣时指出，戴高乐既然宣布要战争，而不要和平，那么“我们要以战争来答复战争”。
    电台说，戴高乐“用不同的口气说出战争可能延续几年之久，并将以法军的胜利而结束。”电台接着指出：“戴高乐把愿望看成了事实。实际上，戴高乐和同他在一起的一切开倒车的征服主义者都会体会到法国在阿尔及利亚的占领军永远也不能战胜我们的军队。法国占领军在阿尔及利亚进行的战争，永远不会胜利结束。在激烈的战斗中，法军官兵将在阿尔及利亚被消灭。戴高乐所说的胜利将使法军终于在阿尔及利亚自掘坟墓。”
    电台说，“戴高乐预计战争时间还会很长，我们对此丝毫不感到惊讶。我们一直说我们的战争将是长期的，还将付出很大的代价。我们经常教导我们的军队，为了在将来粉碎法国人的罪恶行动和取得自由和独立，必要时我们将打几代的仗。”电台指出，尽管阿尔及利亚愿意通过和平谈判取得独立，但是“既然戴高乐向我们宣布要战争，而不要和平。他既然公然暴露出了他本来面目，就不再可能进行有效的谈判。”
    “戴高乐要击败我们，要消灭我们，他希望我国人民成为奴隶。我们希望他很好地了解到，我们宁愿成为一千二百万具尸体，而不愿成为一千二百万名奴隶，我们的抵抗没有止境。我国人民如此众多，我们应当深信我们的事业是神圣的。”
    电台又说，“阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚祖国将永远存在。”“我们祖国有着它的烈士和英雄写下的光荣过去。它将培养未来的一代代的新人，他们将根据过去在监狱、在集中营、在法庭上、在乡村和山区的人的斗争，同军人、男女游击队员和阿尔及利亚光荣的民族解放军战士担任一样的任务，将沉重地打击敌人。”（附图片）
