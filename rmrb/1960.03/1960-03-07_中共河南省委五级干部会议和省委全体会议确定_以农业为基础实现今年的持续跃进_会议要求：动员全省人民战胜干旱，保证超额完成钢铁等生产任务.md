    The Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China Held a Five-Level Cadre Meeting and a Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee to Determine the Realization of a Sustained Leap Forward This Year Based on Agriculture.
    The Meeting Demanded: Mobilize the People of the Entire Province to Overcome Drought and Ensure the Overfulfillment of Production Tasks such as Steel.
    (Our report) Continuing to resolutely implement the general line of socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, continuing to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encouraging enthusiasm, continuing to promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, fully utilizing the subjective initiative of the people, fully utilizing the power of the people's communes, fully tapping the potential of all aspects, and uniting the people of the entire province to strive for the realization of a sustained leap forward in 1960. This is the fighting task of the entire party in Henan Province for 1960, as proposed by the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China at the five-level cadre meeting held from February 4th to 19th. Simultaneously with the five-level cadre meeting, the Provincial Party Committee also held its fifteenth plenary session.
    This meeting mainly summarized the rich experiences of the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 based on the spirit of the central government's instructions, and discussed the plan (suggestions) for the development of the national economy in Henan Province in 1960. It mobilized the entire party and the people of Henan to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better implement the party's general line for building socialism, and strive for the realization of a sustained leap forward in 1960. The meeting listened to the report "Striving for the Realization of a Sustained Leap Forward in 1960" made by Comrade Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the report "Regarding the Plan (Suggestions) for the Development of the National Economy in Henan Province in 1960" by Comrade Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Secretariat, and finally a summary by Comrade Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Secretariat.
    Comrades attending the meeting, through listening to reports, studying and discussing, summarized the experiences of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, recognized the excellent international, domestic, and provincial situation, clarified the great significance of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and correctly handling the proportional relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry; raised the consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's works; and discussed the plan (suggestions) for the development of the national economy in the province in 1960, clarifying the goal of realizing a sustained leap forward in 1960. The meeting also placed special emphasis on carrying out the struggle against drought in the rural areas, overcoming the threat of spring drought, doing a good job in spring plowing production, striving for a bumper harvest of summer wheat, ensuring the completion and over-completion of industrial production plans for steel, coal, machinery, etc., and carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements more extensively and deeply, guiding the technical revolution to develop in the direction of overall and comprehensive innovation in all industries. Specific studies were conducted, and effective measures were taken. The meeting pointed out that the current economic situation in Henan, like the rest of the country, is characterized by a sustained leap forward. This situation of sustained leap forward has been affirmed since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party last year. Thanks to the "three magic weapons" of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, thanks to the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, thanks to the rectification movement carried out within the party and the in-depth socialist and communist education conducted among the broad masses, the face of Henan has undergone significant changes, laying a good foundation for future sustained leap forward. The meeting situation shows that in 1959, all sectors of the national economy in Henan achieved great victories on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in the province increased by 39.1% compared to 1958. Among them, the total value of industrial output increased by 66.3%, and the total value of agricultural output increased by 21.9%. Compared with 1958, major industrial and agricultural products have greatly increased. Total grain output increased by 13.75%, total cotton output increased by 15.1%, total flue-cured tobacco output increased by 19.4%, total oilseed output increased by 39.6%, pig iron (including a very small amount of native iron) increased by 27.5%, steel increased by 89.3%, steel products increased by 206 times, coal increased by 35.6%, and basic construction, transportation, commerce, and scientific, cultural, and educational aspects have all seen tremendous development. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the material living standards of the people have also improved accordingly. The total wages of employees increased by 30%, and the state's expenditure on labor insurance, medical expenses, welfare funds, and other welfare undertakings for employees increased by 28.5%. The average distribution income of members of the rural people's communes also increased by 13.4%. Since entering 1960, Henan has continued to maintain a sustained leap forward. In January of this year, the total value of industrial output exceeded the monthly plan by 4.27%, and many industrial products exceeded the production level of December 1959, achieving a good start, a red month, and a complete success. The labor competition centered on technical innovation and technical revolution is developing vigorously. The large-scale water conservancy construction movement, tool reform movement, and mass movement for developing power in the rural areas are progressing rapidly. The water conservancy construction task of completing 4 billion cubic meters of earthwork and stonework originally planned to be completed in the winter and spring has been overfulfilled before the Spring Festival. The pig raising and fertilizer accumulation movement and the drought resistance and wheat irrigation movement have achieved great results. The tool reform has also developed from individual tool reforms to complete sets of tool reforms, and from the improvement of agricultural tools towards partial mechanization and semi-mechanization. With the development of the technical revolution movement, a new upsurge of cultural revolution has been launched. A large number of advanced figures have emerged on all fronts. Now, whether in cities or in the countryside, the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution is being carried out on a large scale and in an all-round way, which has created a good start for the sustained leap forward in 1960.
    In order to realize a sustained leap forward in 1960, the meeting believes that it is necessary to clarify the guiding ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and correctly handling the proportional relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. This is the most essential issue for the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. Only the high-speed development of agriculture can gradually meet the needs of people's lives, provide more food and raw materials for industry, and expand the market for industrial products. This shows that the development of agriculture is the foundation for the development of industry and all undertakings. The more agriculture develops, the more consolidated the position of industrialization will be. The development of industry, in turn, accelerates the technical transformation of agriculture, further consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis. At the same time, industry must vigorously support agriculture. Industrial sectors such as steel, machinery, and coal, as well as commercial and transportation sectors, must vigorously support agriculture. Scientific, cultural, educational, and other departments should also serve agriculture. The development of agriculture must take grain as the key link, and develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in an all-round way, implementing the simultaneous development of food crops and cash crops, without neglecting either.
    At present, Henan Province is at a crucial juncture of spring production. The meeting called on the people of the entire province to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take advantage of the excellent situation of sustained leap forward, and further launch a large-scale, both vigorous and down-to-earth spring production movement. In particular, in the face of the current threat of spring drought, it is necessary to mobilize the people of the entire province to overcome drought, strengthen wheat field management, ensure a bumper harvest of wheat, and quickly prepare for spring plowing. It is necessary to overcome the complacency of some cadres and the masses, establish the belief that man can conquer nature, resist drought for as long as it lasts, until the final victory. In terms of water conservancy construction, it is necessary to better implement the policy of building and utilizing simultaneously, vigorously develop well-drilling and spring tapping, develop sources of water and conserve water, utilize all surface water and groundwater, and give full play to project benefits, vigorously grasp project support, and serve drought resistance and wheat irrigation. At the same time, it is also necessary to vigorously grasp the production of various vegetables and do a good job in spring afforestation. It is necessary to take pigs as the key link and comprehensively develop animal husbandry. In terms of pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, it is currently necessary to focus on the three key aspects of increasing pig herds, improving the reproduction rate, and improving the survival rate, and carry out a "three no's and two more's" movement: no thin pigs, no disease, no deaths, and more reproduction and more fertilizer accumulation.
    On the industrial front, the meeting pointed out: It is necessary to establish ambitious goals and ensure the over-completion of the production tasks of steel, iron, steel products, and non-ferrous metals. It is necessary to do a good job in coal washing, coking, basic mine construction, and the production of coke and ore, improve the utilization coefficient of converters and blast furnaces, try every means to reduce the coke ratio, vigorously develop coke and ore reserves, and give full play to the power of "small local groups." Wherever there are steel production resources, counties and people's communes can establish small-scale, indigenous steel industries based on the needs of agricultural production to solve the raw material and material problems in agricultural technical transformation. All party members and the broad masses of workers on the industrial front must further establish the idea of industry serving agriculture and vigorously supporting agriculture. This year, industrial support for agriculture should focus particularly on the production of irrigation and drainage machinery and power machinery to ensure the basic realization of irrigation and drainage mechanization throughout the province. At the same time, it is also necessary to assist counties and communes in developing agricultural implement manufacturing industries, developing rural electricity, developing pesticide manufacturing industries, developing rural transportation, and cultivating technical personnel.
    In order to successfully complete the above tasks, the meeting believes that it is necessary to further carry out the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs." On the one hand, it is necessary to widely carry out the mass movement of transforming heavy labor and manual operations into semi-mechanization and mechanization. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop towards high, large, precise, advanced, and new technologies. Currently, on the industrial front, it is necessary to guide the technical revolution movement to the direction of overall and comprehensive innovation in all industries, with large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization as the center, and vigorously carry out technical transformation of "small local group" enterprises; continue to systematically transform the technical equipment of old enterprises, comprehensively improve the mechanization level of modern enterprises, and move towards semi-automation and automation. On the agricultural front, it is necessary to systematically carry out tool reforms in irrigation and drainage, cultivation, transportation, agricultural and sideline product processing, and cooking, taking self-reliance, starting from local methods and gradually adopting foreign methods, and improving tools as the main focus, combined with the vigorous support of industry, to gradually realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture. The meeting required party committees at all levels to earnestly strengthen leadership over the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, conduct in-depth ideological mobilization among the broad masses, closely integrate technology with production, break through weak links, and promote the rapid development of production.
    The meeting pointed out that further consolidating and developing the people's communes is the organizational guarantee for the high-speed development of various socialist undertakings and the realization of a sustained leap forward. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the people's communes, adhere to putting politics in command, constantly summarize and promote the advanced experience of people's commune operation and management, and rapidly improve operation management and living welfare management. It is necessary to formulate plans including the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery under the principle of being active and reliable.
    In order to guarantee the sustained leap forward of the socialist cause, the meeting especially emphasized: conscientiously and systematically studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works and arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought is the most important political task of the entire party in Henan. Party committees at all levels must earnestly strengthen leadership over study, make plans, and establish a regular study system. In particular, it is necessary to systematically establish theoretical teams and strengthen theoretical work.
    The comrades attending the meeting were full of confidence and high morale, and expressed that they would certainly take advantage of the excellent situation, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize and organize the people of the entire province, and strive for the realization of a sustained leap forward in 1960.

    中共河南省委五级干部会议和省委全体会议确定
    以农业为基础实现今年的持续跃进
    会议要求：动员全省人民战胜干旱，保证超额完成钢铁等生产任务
    本报讯　继续坚决贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，继续发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，充分发挥人民群众的主观能动作用，充分发挥人民公社的威力，充分挖掘各方面的潜力，团结全省人民，为实现1960年的持续跃进而奋斗，这是中共河南省委在2月4日至19日召开的五级干部会议上，提出的1960年河南全党的战斗任务。在召开五级干部会议的同时，省委还召开了第十五次全体会议。
    这次会议，主要是根据中央的指示精神，总结1959年继续大跃进的丰富经验，讨论1960年河南省发展国民经济的计划（建议）。动员河南全党和全省人民，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，更好地贯彻执行党的建设社会主义总路线，为实现1960年的持续跃进而奋斗。会议听取了中共河南省委第一书记吴芝圃同志所作的“为实现1960年的持续跃进而奋斗”的报告、书记处书记赵文甫同志“关于河南省1960年发展国民经济计划（建议）”的报告，最后由书记处书记杨蔚屏同志作了总结。
    到会同志，通过听报告、学习和讨论，总结了两年来大跃进的经验，认清了国际、国内和本省的大好形势，明确了发展国民经济以农业为基础，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，正确处理农业、轻工业、重工业之间比例关系的重大意义；提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性；并讨论了1960年全省发展国民经济的计划（建议），明确了实现1960年持续跃进的目标。会议还特别着重对当前农村中开展抗旱斗争，战胜春旱威胁搞好春耕生产，争取夏季小麦大丰收，保证完成和超额完成钢铁、煤炭、机械等工业生产计划，以及更加广泛深入地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，把技术革命引向全行业、全面革新的方向发展等问题，都作了具体研究，并采取了有效措施。会议指出，目前河南同全国一样，经济形势的特点是持续跃进。这种持续跃进的形势，从去年党的八届八中全会以后，就已经肯定下来了。由于有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社“三大法宝”，由于有了1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，由于在党内开展了整风运动和在广大群众中深入进行了社会主义和共产主义教育，河南的面貌已经发生了显著的变化，为今后持续跃进奠定了良好的基础。会议情况表明：1959年，河南国民经济各部门在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了巨大的胜利。1959年全省工农业总产值比1958年增长39．1％。其中，工业总产值增长66．3％，农业总产值增长21．9％。同1958年相比，工农业主要产品都有极大的增长。粮食总产量增长13．75％，棉花总产量增长15．1％，烤烟总产量增长19．4％，油料总产量增长39．6％，生铁（包括极少数土铁）增长27．5％，钢增长89．3％，钢材增长206倍，煤炭增长35．6％，基本建设、交通运输、商业，以及科学文化教育等方面，都有巨大的发展。随着工农业生产的发展，人民群众的物质生活水平也有相应的提高。职工工资总额增长30％，国家用于职工的劳动保险金、医药费、福利费，以及其他福利事业的开支增长28．5％，农村人民公社社员的平均分配收入也增长了13．4％。进入1960年以来，河南仍是持续跃进的形势。今年1月份，工业总产值超额4．27％完成了月计划，许多工业产品都超过了1959年12月份的生产水平，实现了开门红，全月红，满堂红。以技术革新和技术革命为中心的劳动竞赛，正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。农村中大规模的水利建设运动，工具改革运动以及大办动力的群众运动，更是一日千里。原订在去冬今春完成的四十亿土石方的水利建设任务，已经在春节前超额完成。养猪积肥和抗旱浇麦运动，已经取得了巨大的成绩。工具改革也由单个的工具改革发展到成套的工具改革，由农具的改良朝着部分机械化和半机械化的方向迈进。随着技术革命运动的发展，掀起了文化革命的新高潮。各个战线都涌现出了大批先进人物。现在不论城市和农村，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约的群众运动，正在大规模地全面开展，这就为1960年的持续跃进，创立了良好的开端。
    为了实现1960年的持续跃进，会议认为，必须明确以农业为基础的指导思想，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合、正确处理农业、轻工业、重工业之间的比例关系，这是国民经济高速度按比例发展的最本质的问题。只有农业的高速度发展，才能逐步满足人民生活的需要，才能给工业提供更多的粮食和原料，扩大工业品的市场。这说明农业的发展是工业和一切事业发展的基础，农业愈发展，工业化的阵地就愈巩固。工业的发展又反过来加速农业的技术改造，使工农联盟在新的基础上进一步巩固和发展。同时，工业必须大力支援农业。钢铁、机械、煤炭等工业部门及商业、交通运输部门，都要大力支援农业。科学文化、教育等部门，也都要为农业服务。发展农业必须以粮为纲，农林牧副渔全面发展，实行粮食作物和经济作物同时并举，不能偏废。
    目前，河南省正处在春季大生产的紧要关头。会议号召全省人民高举毛泽东思想的红旗，乘持续跃进的大好形势，进一步掀起大规模的、既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的春季大生产运动。尤其是目前面临春旱威胁，必须动员全省人民战胜干旱，加强麦田管理，保证小麦大丰收，并迅速做好春耕准备工作。要克服部分干部和群众存在的麻痹思想，树立人定胜天的信念，旱到什么时候，抗到什么时候，一直到最后胜利。在水利建设方面，要更好地贯彻边建设边利用的方针，大搞打机井下泉，开源节流，把地上水和地下水全部利用起来，并充分发挥工程效益，大抓工程配套，为抗旱浇麦服务。同时，还要大抓各种蔬菜生产，并做好春季植树造林工作。要以猪为纲，全面发展畜牧业。在养猪积肥方面，目前必须大抓猪群，提高繁殖率，提高成活率三个关键，开展一个无瘦猪、无病疫、无死亡和繁殖多、积肥多的“三无两多”运动。
    在工业战线上，会议指出：必须树立雄心大志，保证超额完成钢、铁、钢材和有色金属的生产任务。要搞好洗煤、炼焦、矿山基本建设和焦炭、矿石生产，提高转炉、高炉利用系数，千方百计降低焦比，大搞焦炭和矿石储备，充分发挥“小洋群”的威力。凡是有钢铁生产资源的地方，县和人民公社可根据农业生产的需要，举办小型土法生产的钢铁工业，解决农业技术改造中的原料和材料问题。工业战线全体党员和广大职工，必须进一步树立工业为农业服务、大力支援农业的思想。工业对农业的支援，今年特别要抓紧排灌机械和动力机械的生产，保证全省基本实现排灌机械化。同时还要协助县、社发展农具制造工业，发展农村电力，发展农药制造工业，发展农村交通运输，培养技术人材。
    为了胜利完成上述任务，会议认为：必须进一步开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，要坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，一方面要广泛开展变笨重劳动和手工操作为半机械化和机械化的群众运动，一方面要向高、大、精、尖、新发展。当前在工业战线上，要把技术革命运动引向全行业、全盘革新的方向，以大搞机械化、半机械化为中心，大搞“小土群”企业的技术改造；继续有计划地改造老企业的技术设备，全面提高现代化企业的机械化程度，向半自动化、自动化迈进。在农业战线上，要有计划地进行排灌、耕作、交通运输、农副产品加工和炊事等方面的工具改革，以自力更生，由土到洋，改良工具为主，结合工业的大力支援，逐步实现农业的半机械化和机械化。会议要求各级党委必须切实加强对技术革新和技术革命运动的领导，在广大群众中深入进行思想发动，把技术与生产密切结合起来，突破薄弱环节，促进生产的迅速发展。
    会议指出：进一步巩固和发展人民公社，是各项社会主义事业高速度发展、实现持续跃进的组织保证，各级党委必须加强对人民公社的领导，坚持政治挂帅，不断总结和推广人民公社经营管理的先进经验，迅速提高经营管理和生活福利管理。要在积极可靠的原则下，制定出包括农林牧副渔全面发展的计划。
    为了保证社会主义事业的持续跃进，会议特别强调指出：认真系统地学习毛泽东主席著作，以毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，是河南全党最重要的政治任务。各级党委一定要切实加强对学习的领导，作出规划，建立经常的学习制度。特别是要有计划地建立理论队伍，加强理论工作。
    到会同志信心百倍，斗志昂扬，纷纷表示，一定乘大好形势，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，动员和组织全省人民，为实现1960年持续跃进而奋斗。
