Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: News from Tokyo: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party published a statement in today's "Akahata" newspaper, lodging a serious protest in the name of the Japanese people against Adenauer's visit to Japan, and firmly demanding that he get out of Japan quickly.

The statement pointed out that Adenauer's visit to Japan is not a good thing for world peace or the Japanese people. Because Adenauer is the closest friend of US imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces, and an advocate of Hitler's militarism and fascism.

The statement revealed that Adenauer's visit to Japan, under the guise of "Japanese-German friendship," supports the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and Japanese reactionary forces, as well as the US-Japan military alliance, enabling Japan and West Germany to promote revanchism and militarism together. The statement pointed out that such "Japanese-German friendship" will once again make the people of Japan and West Germany victims of war and fascism.

The statement emphasized that the Japanese people will never forget what Hitler and Hideki Tojo did, and the Japanese people will definitely make a correct response to the tricks of Hitler and Tojo's successors—Adenauer and Nobusuke Kishi.

The statement called on Japanese workers, farmers, citizens, intellectuals, and people from all groups and parties who are launching a struggle against the ratification of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" to take action and resolutely oppose the conspiracies of US imperialism and the Japanese and West German reactionaries.

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement today pointing out that when West Germany has become militarized with the support of the United States, and when a US-Japan military alliance has been formed due to the signing of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," the Socialist Party opposes any conspiracy to restore the previous anti-communist military alliance through talks between Nobusuke Kishi and Adenauer.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: News from Tokyo: The Japan Peace Committee and the National Relief Association jointly dispatched representatives today to submit a letter of protest to the West German Embassy in Japan, lodging a serious protest against West German Chancellor Adenauer's activities in Japan.

The letter of protest strongly condemned Adenauer for openly reviving German militarism and Nazism, suppressing the West German people, and attempting to strengthen cooperation with the Nobusuke Kishi government through this visit to prepare for launching a new war.

Those who went to the West German Embassy to protest included Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, and Hideo Namba, Vice Chairman of the National Relief Association.

Yesterday, when Adenauer arrived at Tokyo Haneda Airport by plane, a protest group dispatched by the Japanese Communist Party and about five hundred Tokyo citizens demonstrated at Haneda Airport, shouting "Adenauer Get Out!"

Xinhua News Agency, 25th: News from Tokyo: West German Chancellor Adenauer arrived in Tokyo tonight from Hawaii after visiting the United States for an eight-day visit.

In a statement made at Haneda Airport today, Adenauer specifically mentioned that West Germany and Japan received "the help of their common friends" after the war.

Adenauer had secret talks with President Eisenhower during his stay in the United States. He is scheduled to meet with Nobusuke Kishi tomorrow, who recently signed the US-Japan military alliance with the United States. It is revealed that these two, as the main executors of the US aggressive policy in Asia and Europe, will also discuss issues related to the highest-level meeting, the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," and the economic expansion of Japan and West Germany to underdeveloped countries.

    不许日德军国主义加紧勾结策划战争阴谋
    日本人民要阿登纳滚回去
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会在今天的“赤旗报”上发表声明，以日本人民名义对阿登纳的访日提出严重抗议，并且坚决要求他迅速滚出日本。
  声明指出，阿登纳的访日对于世界和平和日本人民都不是好事情。因为，阿登纳是美帝国主义和日本反动势力的最亲密的朋友，并且是希特勒军国主义和法西斯主义的鼓吹者。
    声明揭露，阿登纳访日是在“日德亲善”的幌子下支持岸信介内阁和日本反动势力以及日美军事同盟，使日本和西德一道推行报复主义和军国主义。声明指出，这样的“日德亲善”将再一次使日本和西德人民充当战争和法西斯主义的牺牲品。
    声明强调说，日本人民是绝不会忘记希特勒和东条英机的所作所为的，日本人民一定会对希特勒和东条的继承人——阿登纳和岸信介的把戏作出正确的答复。
    声明呼吁正在为反对批准新日美“安全条约”而展开斗争的日本工人、农民、市民、知识分子和各团体以及各党派人士行动起来，坚决反对美帝国主义和日本、西德反动派的阴谋。
    日本社会党今天发表声明指出，当西德在美国支持下已经军国主义化的时候，当由于签订新日美“安全条约”而形成日美军事同盟的时候，社会党反对任何通过岸信介和阿登纳会谈恢复以前的反共军事同盟的阴谋。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本和平委员会和国民救援会今天联合派遣代表向西德驻日大使馆递交抗议书，对西德总理阿登纳到日本活动提出严重抗议。
    抗议书强烈谴责阿登纳公然复活德国军国主义和纳粹主义，镇压西德人民，并且企图通过这次访日加强同岸信介政府的合作，为发动新战争作准备。
    前往西德大使馆抗议的有日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎和国民救援会副会长难波英夫等人。
    昨天，当阿登纳乘飞机到达东京羽田机场时，日本共产党派出的抗议团和东京市民约五百人在羽田机场示威，高喊“阿登纳滚回去”！
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：西德总理阿登纳在访问美国后今晚从夏威夷到达东京，作历时八天的访问。
    阿登纳今天在羽田机场发表的谈话中，特别提到西德和日本在战后受到“它们共同的朋友的帮助”。
    阿登纳在美国期间曾经同艾森豪威尔总统密谈。他预定明天同最近刚刚同美国签订了日美军事同盟的岸信介会谈。据透露，这两个作为美国侵略政策在亚洲和欧洲的主要执行者，还将讨论有关最高级会议问题，新日美“安全条约”问题以及日本和西德向不发达国家进行经济扩张等问题。（附图片）
