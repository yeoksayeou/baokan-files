Xinhua News Agency, March 13th dispatch from Paris: The French newspaper "l'Humanité Hebdo" published on March 13th an article by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, on Khrushchev's upcoming visit to France, entitled "Salute to the Messenger of Peace."

Thorez wrote that there is every reason to expect that Khrushchev will be received with a warm welcome by the French people, the ordinary French people who yearn for peace. The French will welcome Khrushchev, the representative of the great Soviet people who made significant sacrifices in the common war against Hitler. The French will welcome a participant in the Battle of Stalingrad. The French will welcome a tireless fighter for peace and rapprochement between all peoples. It is hoped that this Franco-Soviet meeting will achieve further progress in easing tensions and eliminating the Cold War.

Thorez said that the time has come to end the abnormal situation that continues to exist in West Berlin and throughout Germany. The city of Berlin is still under a military occupation regime; Germany remains divided; fifteen years after the end of hostilities, a peace treaty has still not been concluded. This situation has favored and continues to favor the rampant activities of West German militarists, who have rebuilt their army and armed it with atomic weapons, and are establishing military bases in Spain and even on French soil. The Soviet government has proposed granting West Berlin the status of a free city until Germany is fully reunified, and has proposed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. These proposals are fully in line with the interests of France and the cause of peace.

Thorez pointed out that the head of the Soviet government put forward a plan for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations. He said that the rapid and supervised implementation of this plan would also be very beneficial to France, because one-third of the French budget is used for armaments, including atomic weapons, and there are many foreign military bases in France. Therefore, this Soviet proposal has aroused a wide response in France.

Thorez said that Khrushchev will be seen by the vast majority of French people as a messenger of peace. All of France says "Welcome" to Khrushchev and expresses the hope and belief that his visit and his talks with the French President will contribute to peace and the traditional friendship between the French and Soviet peoples.

Raymond Guyot, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, emphasized in "l'Humanité" on the 12th that expanding cultural ties between France and the Soviet Union is of great significance for strengthening the friendship between the two peoples. He hoped that the upcoming talks between the head of the Soviet government and the French President will further strengthen these ties. Guyot also emphasized that expanding economic, cultural, travel, and scientific ties between France and its great friend is a characteristic of Franco-Soviet friendship at this stage. He hoped that the "traditional friendship between the people of the two countries will continue to strengthen."

    多列士发表文章指出
    法国人民欢迎赫鲁晓夫访法
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国“人道报星期刊”13日刊载了法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士就赫鲁晓夫即将到法国的访问所写的一篇文章，题目是“向和平的使者致敬”。
    多列士写道，有一切理由预料赫鲁晓夫将受到法国人民、法国热望和平的普通人热诚的接待。法国人将欢迎在反对希特勒的共同战争中作出重大牺牲的伟大的苏联人民的代表赫鲁晓夫。法国人将欢迎一个斯大林格勒战斗的参加者。法国人将欢迎争取和平和各国人民之间的接近的不知疲倦的战士。人们希望这次法苏会晤将能在缓和紧张局势和消除冷战方面取得进一步的成就。
    多列士说，现在已经是结束继续存在于西柏林和整个德国的不正常局势的时候了。柏林城目前仍然处在军事占领制度下；德国仍然分裂为二；敌对行动结束以后十五年仍然还没有缔结和约。这种局势过去和现在都有利于西德军国主义者的猖獗活动，他们已重建了他们的军队，并且已用原子武器装备起来和正在西班牙甚至在法国本土上建立军事基地。苏联政府建议在德国完全恢复统一以前给予西柏林以自由城市的地位，并且建议缔结对德和约。这些建议完全符合法国的利益和和平事业的利益。
    多列士指出，苏联政府首脑在联合国提出了全面和彻底裁军的计划。他说，迅速和有监督地实现这一计划对法国来说也是非常有利。因为法国预算的三分之一用于武装，其中包括原子武装，而且在法国有许多外国军事基地。因此苏联这个建议在法国引起广泛反应。
    多列士说，赫鲁晓夫将被极大多数的法国人看作是和平的使者。整个法国都向赫鲁晓夫说“欢迎”，并表示希望和相信他的访问和他将同法国总统的会谈有助于和平和法苏两国人民之间的传统友谊。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员雷蒙·居约12日在“人道报”上强调指出，扩大法苏两国的文化联系对加强两国人民之间的友谊具有重大的意义。他希望苏联政府首脑和法国总统即将举行的会谈将使这种联系进一步加强。居约还强调指出，扩大法国和它的伟大朋友之间的经济、文化、旅行和科学方面的联系是现阶段法苏友谊的特点。他希望法苏“两国人民之间传统的友谊不断加强。”
