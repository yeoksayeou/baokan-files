Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei Province is focusing on field management of wheat, barley, and other crops while engaging in busy spring plowing to strive for a bumper summer grain harvest this year, changing the past situation in southern regions of emphasizing autumn harvests and neglecting summer harvests.

The area of summer grain crops in Hubei Province this year has increased by more than half compared to last year. About 80% of the wheat fields were deep ploughed during the autumn sowing, generally ensuring sufficient base fertilizer, and universally promoting advanced technologies such as strip planting with close spacing. Around the Spring Festival, weeding and topdressing were carried out once in most areas; many areas even carried out topdressing and weeding two or three times, and wheat seedlings are generally growing well. However, many of this year's summer harvest crops in the province are planted on newly reclaimed wasteland. In order to ensure a large-scale increase in the production of wheat and other summer fields, since the beginning of spring, a high tide of field management with the large-scale application of wheat jointing fertilizer as the main task has been launched. Jingzhou Prefecture launched a "six catches up" (mountains catch up with plains, alluvial fields catch up with terraces, distant fields catch up with nearby fields, newly reclaimed fields catch up with mature fields, large fields catch up with experimental fields, coarse grains catch up with staple grains) balanced production increase campaign. All summer harvest crop fields in the area have been cleared of ditches once; more than 1.3 million mu of land with poor growth have been topdressed and weeded once. Jiangling County in this prefecture mobilized the masses to apply fertilizer to more than 90,000 mu of wheat fields and weed 80,000 mu in one week.

In strengthening field management of summer harvest crops, various regions have used many successful experiences from the Great Leap Forward in the past two years. First, strengthen the leadership of the Party, and cadres take the lead. Yunmeng, Hongan, Ying shan, Xishui, Sui County, Zhaoyang and other counties have several
thousand cadres taking the lead in carrying out high-yield experiments in third-class seedling fields, making models, and driving the masses to seize the upgrade of third-class seedlings. After more than 5,000 cadres above the level of team leader in Ying shan County took the lead in carrying out high-yield experiments in third-class seedling fields, the county's third-class wheat fields rapidly decreased from 120,000 mu to 70,000 mu. Second, insert red flags, organize evaluations and competitions. Yun County recently launched a high tide of topdressing, weeding, and pest control through field management inspections and evaluations. Yidu area regarded Herong Commune in Dangyang County, which had good summer harvest crop management, as a red flag, and called on people's communes in the whole area to learn from it. The Qiaobian Commune in Yichang County originally believed that the commune's summer harvest crops had generally been topdressed twice and weeded twice, which was good; after carrying out the "Learn from Herong, Catch up with Herong" campaign, they found that some wheat seedlings were not growing up to standard, and immediately formed more than 500 shock teams to rush to topdress and weed, so that the wheat seedlings quickly grew well.

(By our reporter) The Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu, where winter wheat planting area accounts for one-half of the total area of Gansu Province, is seizing spring irrigation and attacking the key to wheat regreening. So far, the area has irrigated 2.31 million mu of wheat fields and applied topdressing to 5.41 million mu, creating good conditions for a bumper wheat harvest. Since the winter of last year, there has been little rain and snow in the area. According to meteorological forecasts, there will also be a lack of rain from March to June this year. The Pingliang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued an emergency instruction, requesting that on the basis of the significant achievements already made in wheat field management, a decisive battle be launched against drought to ensure the realization of a bumper harvest.

In seizing the wheat regreening stage, Party committee secretaries at all levels have personally participated in labor and guided the masses to combine water storage with current irrigation, using all water sources for large-scale and skillful irrigation, striving to ensure that wheat fields are irrigated in a timely manner and that seedlings are guaranteed to be well watered. The people of Jingchuan County, which obtained a bumper wheat harvest last year, proposed to all counties in the area to carry out the current wheat field management competition, with the condition that quick irrigation of regreening water and more application of regreening fertilizer should promote early wheat regreening. The county mobilized more than 100,000 laborers, and in more than 20 days, applied 5,000 to 7,000 jin of regreening fertilizer per mu to 700,000 mu of wheat fields, irrigated 160,000 mu of wheat fields with regreening water, cultivated, weeded and harrowed 370,000 mu of wheat fields, and repaired and prevented frost furnaces for more than 400,000. According to the latest inspection, the tillering rate of the county's 1.3 million mu of wheat fields has increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year. Qingyang County is now combining the repair, storage and irrigation according to the characteristics of plateau irrigation to achieve side-by-side repair and irrigation, in addition to irrigating 470,000 mu, and also building dams in gullies and drilling wells at the source to store 8.2 million cubic meters of water, which not only guarantees the needs of wheat fields, but also protects 80% of the county's cultivated land from drought. Ning County is actively preparing five "defense lines", carrying out round-the-clock irrigation in areas with water conservancy facilities, and universally carrying out water carrying and point watering in other areas. The people's communes in the whole area located along the Jing River have also adopted the method of building dams to intercept water in sections of the Jing River, and using pumps and waterwheels to draw water to irrigate fields.

All people's communes in the area have universally established and improved wheat field management professional teams and irrigation professional teams, and promoted the "five-determination" responsibility system of determining land plots, determining personnel, determining indicators, determining measures, and determining quality, so as to ensure that every area has a commander and every plot has soldiers, so that wheat field management achieves the requirements of garden management, standardized technology, professional management, and frequent inspection and evaluation. In irrigating regreening water, all regions have also paid attention to economical water use and improved irrigation effectiveness and water use rate. The Jinghe People's Commune in Pingliang City held a forum for old farmers and technicians to study irrigation methods suitable for local conditions. The experience of irrigating according to weather, land and soil moisture conditions was implemented in the irrigation, which greatly improved the quality and efficiency of irrigation, and ensured that no drop was missed and every ridge was irrigated. While managing general fields, the whole prefecture focused on the careful cultivation of 1.5 million mu of high-yield squares and high-yield fields, and the processing and management of third-class fields, adding water and fertilizer to strive for perfection, and requiring that all 120,000 mu of third-class wheat fields in the area be upgraded by the end of the month.

    确保小麦和其他夏收作物大面积平衡增产
    湖北全面加强田间管理
    甘肃平凉专区以春灌为中心猛攻小麦返青关
    新华社武汉电　湖北省各地在繁忙的春耕生产同时，大抓小麦、大麦等作物的田间管理，力争今年夏季粮食大丰收，改变了过去南方地区重秋收轻夏收的情况。
    湖北省今年的夏收粮食作物面积，比去年增加二分之一以上。去秋播种时80％左右的麦地都进行了深耕，一般做到了底肥充足，并普遍推行了条播密植等先进技术。春节前后，各地又普遍锄草、追肥各一次；不少的地区还追肥、锄草两三次，各地麦苗都生长良好。但是，全省今年夏收作物不少是种在新垦荒地上。为了确保小麦和其他夏田大面积增产，入春以来，各地掀起了以大追小麦拔节肥为主的田间管理高潮。荆州专区，开展了“六赶”（山区赶平原、冲田赶畈田、远田赶近田、新垦田赶熟田、大田赶试验田、杂粮赶主粮）平衡增产运动，全区夏收作物田普遍清过一次沟；生长较差的一百三十多万亩，都增追一次肥和锄一次草。这个专区的江陵县，发动群众一周间给麦田追肥九万多亩，锄草八万多亩。
    在加强夏收作物田间管理工作中，各地运用了过去两年大跃进中许多成功的经验。首先，加强党的领导，干部带头。云梦、红安、应
  山、浠水、随县、枣阳等县都有几
  千干部带头在三类苗田里搞丰产试验，作出样板，带动群众大抓三类苗升级工作。应山县小队长以上的五千多名干部，带头在三类苗田里搞丰产试验后，使全县三类苗麦田迅速由十二万亩下降到七万亩。其次，插红旗，组织评比、竞赛。郧县最近通过田间管理大检查、大评比，掀起追肥、锄草、除虫高潮。宜都地区把夏收作物管理好的当阳县河溶公社作为红旗，号召全区人民公社学习。宜昌县桥边公社原来认为全社夏收作物已普遍追了两次肥，锄了两道草，不错了；开展“学河溶、赶河溶”活动后，发现有的麦苗长得还不够标准，立即组成五百多个突击组，突击追肥、锄草，使麦苗迅速长好。
    本报讯　冬小麦播种面积占甘肃全省二分之一的平凉专区，正大抓春灌，猛攻小麦返青关。到目前为止，全区已灌溉麦田二百三十一万亩，施追肥五百四十一万亩，为小麦丰收创造了良好条件。去年入冬以来，全区雨雪稀少，据气象预报今年3至6月也将缺雨，中共平凉地委已发出紧急指示，要求在麦田管理已取得重大成绩的基础上，和旱灾展开决战，保证实现丰收到手。
    全区各地在大抓小麦返青关中，各级党委书记都亲自参加劳动，指导群众把蓄水和现灌结合起来，利用一切水源大灌巧灌，力争做到麦田块块适时灌溉，苗苗保证喝饱。获得去年小麦大丰收的泾川县人民，以快灌返青水、多施返青肥促使小麦早返青为条件，向全区各县提出开展当前麦田管理竞赛运动。全县出动了十万多名劳力，在二十多天中就给七十多万亩麦田每亩施返青肥五至七千斤，给十六万亩麦田灌了返青水，中耕锄草和镇压耙耘麦田三十七万亩，修防霜炉四十多万个。据最近检查，全县一百三十多万亩麦田分蘖率比去年同期增加了30％以上。庆阳县正根据高原灌溉特点，以修蓄灌相结合做到边修边灌，除已灌溉四十七万亩外，并在沟壑打坝和源面凿井蓄水八百二十多万立方米，这不仅保证了麦田需要，还使全县80％的耕地免受干旱威胁。宁县积极准备五道“防线”，在有水利设施的地区日夜轮灌，其它地区则普遍开展担水点浇。全区位于泾河沿岸的各人民公社还采取在泾河分段筑坝截水的办法，用抽水机和水车抽水灌田。
    全区各人民公社都普遍成立和健全了麦田管理专业队和灌溉专业队，推行了定地块、定人员、定指标、定措施和定质量的“五定”责任制，作到方方有帅、块块有兵，使小麦田间管理实现管理园田化、技术规格化、管理专业化和检查评比经常化的要求。在灌溉返青水中，各地还注意了经济用水，提高灌溉实效和用水率。平凉市泾河人民公社召开了老农和技术员座谈会，研究了因地制宜地灌溉方法，灌溉中贯彻看天看地看墒情的经验，使灌地质量和效率大大提高，作到点滴不漏畦畦灌通。全专区在管理一般田的同时，狠抓一百五十万亩丰产方和丰产田的精心培育和三类田的加工管理，加水加肥精益求精，要求在月底前使全区十二万多亩三类麦田全部升级。
