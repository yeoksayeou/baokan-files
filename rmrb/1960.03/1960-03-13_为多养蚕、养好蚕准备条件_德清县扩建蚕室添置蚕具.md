To prepare conditions for raising more silkworms and raising them well, Deqing County expands silkworm rearing rooms and adds silkworm rearing tools.
    (Our newspaper reports) Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, in order to adapt to the needs of the rapid development of silkworm production this year, has, through comprehensive planning and fully mobilizing the masses, quickly launched a high tide of basic construction such as building silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools. The county has newly built and renovated 15,131 silkworm rearing rooms, and added more than 41,500 silkworm trays, more than 100,000 silkworm bags, and more than 148,000 silkworm nets.
    Before carrying out basic construction of sericulture, the Deqing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized members of the communes to conduct a major debate on "whether or not to engage in basic construction of sericulture." Everyone affirmed that to increase the number of silkworms raised and improve the quality of silkworm cocoons, it is necessary to vigorously carry out basic construction, and therefore actively demanded the addition of silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools, so as to avoid raising "ground silkworms" and to increase silkworm cocoon production many times over. Members of the Gaoqiao Commune said: We can rely on the commune to build silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools, and change the backward method of raising "ground silkworms." They believe that "ground silkworms" have four disadvantages: first, the cocoon production per silkworm egg card is about 25% lower than that of "platform silkworms"; second, the cocoon layer rate is about 30% lower than that of "platform silkworms"; third, the utilization rate of the silkworm rearing room is low; and fourth, "ground silkworms" are prone to silkworm diseases, requiring more medicine and labor. Based on the urgent demands of the masses, and after comprehensive planning, the County Committee decided to mobilize the masses to newly build and repair 22,800 silkworm rearing rooms in the winter and spring seasons, and add 2 million silkworm trays, 120,000 small silkworm nets, and 4 million grass rope nets. After completing this batch of construction tasks, the county's spring silkworm rearing capacity this year can reach 160,000 cards (more than 98,000 cards last year). And "ground silkworms" can be avoided, which will greatly increase cocoon production. Adding silkworm trays and silkworm nets can also increase work efficiency by one to two times, and the county can save more than 80,000 labor forces.
    What methods should be used to increase silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools? The county's experience is: mobilize the masses, rely on their own efforts; use indigenous methods, combine indigenous and foreign methods; use local materials, make do with whatever is available. At the beginning, a few people believed that if we were to engage in basic construction, we should do it in a foreign style, so they felt that materials and construction forces could not be resolved all at once, and it would be difficult to complete the construction task before the spring silkworm season. In order to solve this problem, the Deqing County Committee, together with the masses and technicians, used local bamboo, rice straw, and soil to build a batch of simple silkworm rearing rooms in the Xinyi Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in October last year. This kind of silkworm rearing room has skylights on the top and opposite windows on the north and south sides. Old bamboo curtains coated with lime are used as the roof, which is well ventilated and translucent, and is completely suitable for silkworm rearing. The materials, manpower and design for building this batch of silkworm rearing rooms were all solved by themselves. The cost per room was 36 yuan, and 46 labor days were used. After making a model, the County Committee immediately adopted methods such as publishing introductions in newspapers, organizing visits, sending masters to teach other communes, and sending people from various communes to study, and quickly promoted this experience. After learning this experience, the Gusu Silkworm Rearing Room of Xinshi Commune built five new simple silkworm rearing rooms in two days. After visiting the simple silkworm rearing rooms, the Ganshan Commune newly built 147 simple silkworm rearing rooms. In addition, the county also found more than 30 kinds of substitutes for making silkworm trays. For example, the Xingfu Production Team of Chengguan Commune used old trays, old mats, reed curtains, etc. to make more than 800 simple silkworm trays, with a cost of only 18 cents per tray.
    In carrying out the work of building silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools and other basic construction, the communes have fully demonstrated the superiority of the communes, and have transferred 25%-30% of the labor force to form professional teams, with dedicated personnel responsible for this work. At the same time, the communes also rationally used public accumulation. The amount of public accumulation used was determined according to the proportion of local sericulture production. In addition, they also implemented the principle of equivalent exchange to handle the economic problems of using old materials from commune members' families in the construction of silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools. Commune members generally reflected: "To build houses and engage in construction, we rely entirely on the great strength of the commune."
    At present, the county's work of building silkworm rearing rooms and adding and repairing silkworm rearing tools is continuing.

### 为多养蚕、养好蚕准备条件  德清县扩建蚕室添置蚕具

    为多养蚕、养好蚕准备条件
    德清县扩建蚕室添置蚕具
    本报讯　浙江省德清县为了适应今年蚕桑生产高速度发展的需要，通过全面规划，充分发动群众，迅速掀起了修建蚕室、蚕具等基本建设的高潮。全县已新建改建蚕室一万五千一百三十一间，添置蚕匾四万一千五百多只、蚕袋十万多副、蚕网十四万八千多只。
    在开展蚕桑基本建设以前，中共德清县委组织各公社社员开展了一次“要不要搞蚕桑基本建设”的大辩论。大家肯定了要增加养蚕数量，提高蚕茧质量，就一定要大搞基本建设，因而积极要求增添蚕室蚕具，做到不养“地蚕”，使蚕茧产量成倍地提高。高桥公社社员说：我们依靠公社完全可以建造蚕室蚕具，改变养“地蚕”的落后方法。他们认为“地蚕”有四个坏处：一是平均每张蚕种的产茧量比养“台蚕”低25％左右；第二是茧层率比“台蚕”低30％左右；第三是蚕室的利用率低；第四是“地蚕”容易发蚕病，多花药物和劳动力。县委根据群众的迫切要求，经过全面规划，决定在冬春两季发动群众新建、修建蚕室二万二千八百间，增添蚕匾二百万只，小蚕网十二万只，草绳网四百万只等。完成这批修建任务以后，今年全县的春蚕饲养量，就可以达到十六万张（去年九万八千多张）。并且可以不养“地蚕”，将大大增加产茧量。增添蚕匾蚕网后，还可以提高工效一倍到二倍，全县可以节约劳动力八万多个。
    用什么办法来增加蚕室蚕具呢？这个县的经验是：发动群众，自力更生；土法上马，土洋结合；就地取材，因陋就简。开始时，有少数人认为要搞基本建设就搞洋的，因此觉得材料、建设力量不可能一下子解决，要在春蚕期以前完成修建任务有困难。为了解决这个问题，德清县委在去年10月就同群众、技术员一起，在城关公社的信谊生产队利用土竹、稻草、泥土建造了一批简易蚕室。这种蚕室上有天窗，南北有对口窗，用旧竹帘涂石灰做房顶，通风透光，完全适于养蚕。建造这批蚕室的材料、人力和设计等都是自己解决的，每间成本三十六元，用工四十六个。做出样子以后，县委立即采取登报介绍、组织参观、派出师傅到其他公社教、各公社派人来学习等方法，迅速地推广了这个经验。新市公社姑嫂养蚕室学习这一经验以后，两天内就造起五间新的简易蚕室。干山公社派人参观简易蚕室以后，新造了简易蚕室一百四十七间。此外，全县还找到三十多种制造蚕匾的代用品。如城关公社幸福生产队利用旧匾、旧席、芦帘等，制成了八百多只简易蚕匾，每只成本只有一角八分。
    在开展兴建蚕室蚕具等基本建设的工作中，各公社都充分发挥了公社优越性，抽调25％—30％的劳动力组成专业队，专人负责搞这个工作。同时，各公社还合理地使用了公共积累。根据当地蚕桑生产比重的大小，确定使用公共积累的多少。此外，他们还贯彻执行了等价交换的原则，处理修建蚕室蚕具中使用社员家有旧料的经济问题。社员普遍反映：兴土木，搞建设，全靠公社力量大。
    目前，这个县的建造蚕室、添修蚕具的工作正在继续进行。
