Economic Crops Go Uphill, Releasing Farmland for Grain
Hengfeng County Solves Land Competition Conflict Between Grain, Oil, and Cotton Crops in Mountainous Areas

(Our report) Hengfeng County, Jiangxi Province, has successfully resolved the conflict between oilseeds, fodder, economic crops, and grain for land, ensuring the comprehensive implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward." Hengfeng County has many mountains, a large population, and little land. Of the county's 157,000 mu of cultivated land, 80% is in mountainous areas, with less than two mu per person on average. Apart from the nearly 40,000 mu of overwintering crops, only 117,000 mu can be used this spring. According to the plan, 120,000 mu of rice needs to be planted this year; the county currently raises 180,000 pigs, requiring at least 60,000 mu of fodder land. More than 14,000 mu of oil crops such as peanuts, sesame, and soybeans need to be planted to meet the needs. Economic crops such as jute, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, and tea also require appropriate planting areas. In this way, the county is short of 76,500 mu of land, forming a serious contradiction between grain, oil, cotton, and fodder for land. If the contradiction of competition for land among the four crops is not reasonably arranged, it will not only affect the implementation of the production policy of taking grain as the key link, but also limit the production of oil and cotton and the pig-raising industry, which are major indicators.

To this end, the Hengfeng County Party Committee organized a mass debate, mobilizing the whole people to find land and measures. The broad masses put forward many good ideas and methods for expanding cultivated land and giving full play to land utilization. These methods are concentrated in: turning to the mountains for oil, developing the production of woody tea oil in mountainous areas; using water surfaces, sandbars, wasteland, and forest fields to grow fodder; and using mountains and dry land to replace the paddy fields occupied by economic crops, thereby completely solving the contradiction of mutual competition for land among grain, oil, cotton, and fodder.

Turning to the mountains for oil, developing woody oilseeds, and releasing farmland is a fundamental measure for mountainous areas to take grain as the key link. The mountainous area of Hengfeng County is more than ten times larger than the farmland area. Although many rocky mountains cannot be used, there are also many usable lands in mountain valleys and corners. In addition, the people in these areas have always had the habit of cultivating woody tea oil, so they have good conditions for developing woody oilseeds. After the mass debate on "taking grain as the key link," it not only laid an ideological foundation for the development of woody oilseeds, but also found many effective measures to release grain crop area by developing woody oilseeds: both grasping the reclamation and management of old tea oil forests and grasping the expansion of new tea oil forests to increase tea oil production. Now Hengfeng County has established a tea oil production headquarters, the communes have established command posts, and the production teams have established tea oil professional teams.

More than 10,000 commune members throughout the county live on the mountains and eat on the mountains. In one month, they have reclaimed more than 100,000 mu of old tea forests and planted more than 20,000 mu of new tea oil forests. As a result, the county can overfulfill the task of domestic sales and transfer of tea oil. In the plain areas, in addition to the rape already planted in winter, the originally planned planting area of more than 10,000 mu of oil crops can all be released for planting early rice. Due to the fundamental solution of the grain and oil land competition problem, the three contradictions of grain and oil competing for time, fertilizer, and labor have also been resolved. There is no longer a time conflict due to early rice transplanting, weeding, and rape harvesting; nor is there a labor conflict due to the transplanting and weeding of double-season late rice and the weeding of sesame and beans. More importantly, after overcoming the contradiction of grain and oil competing for land, double-season rice can be transplanted two seasons earlier, thereby avoiding the threat of late frost. At the same time, woody oilseeds do not need fertilization, so grain crops can get 500,000 dan more fertilizer.

Developing fodder production in mountains, water, forests, field ridges, and sandbars is the main way for mountainous areas to raise pigs without occupying basic farmland. Hengfeng County quickly formed a pig feed production inspection team and found three ways to overcome the contradiction between grain and feed for land: (1) Using new tea forests to vigorously develop agroforestry intercropping. This alone makes fodder occupy more than half less farmland. (2) Making full use of field ridges to grow fodder. So far, 3,300 mu of fodder crops such as vegetables and beans have been planted on field ridges. (3) Developing aquatic fodder production. More than 20,000 mu of ponds and reservoirs in the county that are easy to grow aquatic fodder are now planted with water hyacinth. This aquatic plant feed can produce 70,000 jin per mu, becoming an important source of pig feed. In this way, plus rice bran, distiller's grains, corn cobs, and wild fodder collected in the mountains, the more than 60,000 mu of pig feed land required can all be solved.

Hengfeng County has five kinds of economic crops: jute, tobacco, sugarcane, cotton, and mat grass. Among them, except for mat grass, which is a paddy field crop, the others can be grown in dry land. However, in the past, the planting of dry and wet crops was very chaotic, and dry crops also occupied paddy fields. At the beginning of this year's preparation for farming, a thorough adjustment was made, and all dry crops were changed to dry land.

At the same time, nearly 1,000 mu of sandbars were reclaimed along the river to increase irrigation water sources, so that aquatic crops returned to paddy fields. In this way, the area of economic crops has increased by more than doubled, and the area of rice crops is not affected by the area of economic crops.

After all the contradictions between oil crops, economic crops, pig feed, and grain for land were resolved, the area of these three crops increased by nearly doubled compared with the past, and at the same time, the annual total grain output target of 100 million jin was fully guaranteed.

    经济作物上山　让出农田种粮
    横峰县解决山区粮、油、棉花作物争地矛盾
    本报讯　江西横峰县成功地解决了油料、饲料、经济作物与粮争地的矛盾，保证“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针得到全面贯彻。横峰县山多、人多、地少。全县十五万七千多亩耕地，80％是山区，每人平均不到二亩地。这些耕地除去近四万亩越冬作物外，今春能够使用的只有十一万七千多亩。按照计划：今年水稻即需种十二万亩；目前全县已养猪十八万头，所需饲料地最少也要六万亩。花生、芝麻、黄豆等油料作物，也要种植一万四千多亩才能满足需要。黄麻、甘蔗、烟叶、棉花、茶叶等经济作物，也必需有适当的播种面积。这样全县缺地七万六千五百亩，形成了粮、油、棉、饲料争地的严重矛盾。四项作物争地的矛盾，如果得不到合理安排，不仅要影响以粮为纲的生产方针的贯彻，而且四大指标中的油、棉生产和养猪事业也将受到限制。
    横峰县委为此组织全民辩论，发动全民找土地，全民找措施，广大群众提出了许多扩大耕地、充分发挥土地利用率的好主意，好办法。这些办法集中起来，就是：向山要油，发展山区木本茶油生产；利用水面、洲地、荒地、林间田种植饲料；以山岭、旱田，代替经济作物占用的水田，从而彻底解决了粮、油、棉、饲料互相争地的矛盾。
    向山要油，发展木本油料，让出农田，是山区以粮为纲的根本措施。横峰县山区面积比农田面积要多十倍以上，其中虽有许多石山不能利用，但山冲、山角也有不少能用的土地。再加这些地区的群众历来就有培育木本茶油的习惯，因而就具有了发展木本油料的良好条件。经过“以粮为纲”全民辩论，不仅为发展木本油料打下了思想基础，而且还找到了以发展木本油料，让出粮食作物面积的多条有效措施：既抓老茶油林垦复管理，又抓新茶林扩种，以提高茶油产量。现在横峰县成立了油茶生产指挥部，公社成立指挥所，各生产队成立了油茶专业队。
    全县有一万多名社员，住在山上、吃在山上，一个月垦复了十几万亩老茶林，栽种了二万多亩新茶油林。全县因此能超额完成茶油内销和上调的任务。平原地区除去冬已种的油菜，原计划播种的一万多亩油料作物面积，可以全部让出来种早稻。由于油粮争地问题的根本解决，油粮争时、争肥、争劳力的三个矛盾，也就随之得到解决，不再因早稻插秧、耘禾与收割油菜而造成时间矛盾；也不再因二季晚稻插秧耘禾与芝麻、豆类锄草而造成劳力矛盾。更为重要的是粮油争地矛盾克服以后，二季稻可以提前二个季节插秧，从而避免了后期霜冻威胁。同时，木本油料不需施肥，因而稻谷作物就可以多得五十万担肥料。
    向山、水、林和田塍、洲地发展饲料生产，是山区养猪不占基本农田的主要途径。横峰县迅速组成了猪饲料生产检查组，找出克服粮食、饲料争地矛盾的三条办法：（1）利用新茶林大搞农林混作。单这一项，就使饲料少占农田一半以上。（2）充分利用田塍种植饲料。到目前为止，已在田塍上种了三千三百亩菜类、豆类等饲料作物。（3）发展水面饲料生产。这个县二万多亩水塘和便于种植水生饲料的水库，现在都已种上水浮莲。这种水生植物饲料每亩可产七万斤，成为养猪饲料一项重要来源。这样，再加米糠、酒糟、玉米芯和上山采集的野生饲料，所需六万多亩养猪饲料地就可全部得到解决。
    横峰县经济作物的种类有黄麻、烟叶、甘蔗、棉花、席草等五种。其中除席草是水田作物外，其他都可以旱地种植。可是过去水旱作物种的很混乱，旱作物也占用了水田。今年备耕一开始就进行了彻底调整，把所有旱作物都改种到旱田。
    同时在河边开垦了近千亩洲地，增加灌溉水源，使水作物归水田。这样，经济作物既增加一倍以上的面积，水稻作物面积也不受经济作物面积的影响。
    油料作物、经济作物、猪饲料与粮食争地矛盾全部解决后，这三项作物面积就比以前增加了将近一倍，同时全年一亿斤粮食总产量的指标也得到了充分的保证。
