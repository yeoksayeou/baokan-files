Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th - The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany recently published an outline commemorating the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day "March 8th".

The outline stated that the equal rights obtained by women are one of the great achievements of the German Democratic Republic. In the German Democratic Republic, men and women are building socialism together. Of the 466 members of the People's Chamber, 114 are female members, 26.8% of the country's judges are women, and women account for 43.9% of office staff.

The outline stated that to date, more than 102,000 women have been awarded the title of "Model Worker of the Five-Year Plan," 24 are "Labor Heroes," and 7 have received the title of "Glorious Inventor." Thirty-three women have been awarded state prizes, one woman has received the gold "Fatherland Merit" medal, and 158 women have received the title of "Master Athlete."

The outline stated that in West Germany, women are paid differently for the same work, and the Democratic Women's League is banned. The women of the German Democratic Republic believe that helping their sisters in West Germany is one of the most important tasks in their struggle against West German militarism and imperialism. The women of the German Democratic Republic have set an example for West German women in their struggle for liberation and genuine equality.

The outline concluded by calling on the women of the German Democratic Republic to dedicate all their strength to completing the Seven-Year Plan and striving for the victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic.

    德国统一社会党发表提纲
    号召妇女全力建设社会主义
    据新华社柏林24日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会最近发表了纪念国际“三八”妇女节五十周年的提纲。
    提纲说，妇女获得平等权利，是德意志民主共和国取得的伟大成就之一。在德意志民主共和国，男子和妇女在一起建设社会主义。在人民议院的四百六十六名议员中有一百一十四人是女议员，全国法官中有26．8％是妇女，职员中妇女占43．9％。
    提纲说，到目前为止，已有十万二千多名妇女获得了“五年计划劳动模范”的称号，二十四人是“劳动英雄”，七人得到了“光荣发明家”的称号。有三十三位妇女被授予国家奖，有一位妇女获得了金质“祖国功勋”奖章，一百五十八位妇女得到了“运动健将”的称号。
    提纲说，在西德，妇女同工不同酬，妇女民主联合会遭到禁止。德意志民主共和国的妇女认为，帮助她们在西德的姐妹们，是她们反对西德军国主义和帝国主义的斗争中的最重大的任务之一。德意志民主共和国妇女为西德妇女争取解放和真正的平等树立了榜样。
    提纲最后号召德意志民主共和国妇女们为完成七年计划和争取社会主义在德意志民主共和国的胜利而献出一切力量。
