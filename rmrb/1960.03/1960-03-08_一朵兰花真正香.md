    A single orchid is truly fragrant.
    Seventeen or eighteen years old,
    Her name is Lan Hua,
    A pair of large eyes hidden under her hat,
    A medal shining brightly.
    When she first entered the factory, she didn't talk much,
    She studied knives and guns for six months under a master,
    At the martial arts competition last New Year's Day,
    She stood tall and proud on the stage.
    One after another, innovation proposals blossomed,
    Strings of silver fruits filled the granary.
    Why do the targets jump every month?
    Why do red flowers adorn her chest every month?
    The General Line is a headlight,
    Illuminating her eyes and making her heart bloom;
    The Leader's works are the sun and moon,
    Opening up the broad chest of the proletariat!

    一朵兰花真正香
    年纪十七八，
    名字叫兰花，
    一对大眼帽下藏，
    一颗奖章发着光。
    刚进厂时话不多，
    六个月拜师学刀枪，
    去年元旦比武会，
    挺胸昂首擂台上。
    一件件革新建议开了花，
    一串串银果落满仓。
    为啥指标月月跳？
    为啥红花月月戴胸上？
    总路线是盏车头灯，
    眼睛照亮心花放；
    领袖著作是日月，
    敞开了无产阶级宽胸膛！
