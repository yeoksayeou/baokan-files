Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 21st: U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Bonsal, returned to Havana on the 20th. Before departing from New York, Bonsal issued a statement saying that his return to Havana indicated the U.S. government's "willingness to continue negotiations with the Cuban government."

However, even as U.S. officials are promoting continued "negotiations" with Cuba, attacks and threats against Cuba from the U.S. side have further intensified. The day before Bonsal returned to Havana, Senator Bridges, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, clamored that "the Cuban situation is deteriorating." He emphasized that "the (U.S.) government should and must adopt a tougher policy towards Cuba." Senator Smathers viciously attacked the Cuban government in the U.S. Senate on the 18th, calling it a "communist-controlled government." U.S. Secretary of State Herter, in a television interview on the 20th, repeated the same slander against the Cuban government when discussing U.S. relations with Cuba. He threatened that the actions of some people within the Cuban government "seem to be following the communist way." As everyone knows, seven years ago, the U.S., under the pretext of so-called "communist infiltration," launched an armed overthrow of the Arbenz government in Guatemala.

### 美国加紧威胁古巴  布里奇斯鼓吹对古巴采取强硬政策

    美国加紧威胁古巴
    布里奇斯鼓吹对古巴采取强硬政策
    据新华社21日讯　哈瓦那消息：美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔20日回到哈瓦那。邦沙尔在纽约动身前发表声明说，他这次返回哈瓦那表明了美国政府“愿意同古巴政府继续谈判。”
    可是，正当美国官方宣传要同古巴继续进行“谈判”时，来自美国方面的对古巴的攻击和威胁进一步加剧了。在邦沙尔回到哈瓦那的前一天，美国参议院共和党政策委员会主席布里奇斯大肆叫嚣“古巴局势日益恶化”。他强调“（美国）政府应该而且必须对古巴的政策强硬起来”。参议员斯马瑟斯18日在美国参议院恶毒地攻击古巴政府是一个“受共产党控制的政府”。美国国务卿赫脱20日在电视谈话中谈到美国同古巴的关系时，同样重复了对古巴政府的上述诽谤。他恫吓说，古巴政府内部某些人的行动“看来好像在遵循共产党的方式”。大家知道，七年前美国就是在所谓“共产主义渗入”的借口下，发动了对危地马拉阿本斯政府的武装颠复。
