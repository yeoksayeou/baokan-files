    Steaming Hot, Full of Joy, March Opens with Good News:
    Steel Production Great Leap Forward in Full Swing
    Shigang Completes First Quarter Steel Production Plan 27 Days Ahead of Schedule
    Angang, Chonggang, Taigang, and Yegang See Rapid Production Increases in First Five Days of March
    Shigang

    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company fought bravely, and the first quarter's steel production plan was successfully completed 27 days ahead of schedule on the 4th, fulfilling one of the guarantee conditions of the initiative three days ahead of schedule. So far, the average daily steel output of the entire company since the beginning of this year has increased by 25.64% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and the average qualified rate of steel ingots has reached over 99%, with both output and quality setting the highest records since the plant was established.

    After the initiative was issued, the enthusiasm of Shigang's workers doubled. Each workshop, section, group, and individual formulated guarantee conditions to realize the initiative. Everyone worked together to tackle key production issues and vigorously improve operations. The converter steelmaking workers launched a rapid steelmaking competition, with each shift formulating combat plans before the shift. During the competition, workers used different wind pressures and volumes according to the changes in each furnace of steel during the early, middle, and late stages of smelting, as well as the different characteristics of new and final furnaces. At the same time, they organized large-scale collaborations of ironmaking, casting, and crane operations around the converter, reducing the time for smelting each furnace of steel from 41 minutes to 32 minutes, increasing steel production levels by 14.5%.

    From the beginning of the steel production battle, Party and government leaders of the steelmaking plant went to the front line of production. Targeting the problem that ironmaking furnaces could not be turned on according to the plan, resulting in insufficient molten steel supply for the converters, they worked with the workers to study the plan for opening, stopping, and repairing the ironmaking furnaces according to the plan, which was quickly implemented, ensuring a balanced and sufficient supply of molten iron. The leaders of the electric furnaces went deep into the site every day, conducting technical analysis furnace by furnace with the workers, improving operations in a timely manner, and strengthening the coordination between processes, increasing the daily production level of electric furnace steel by 10%.

    The workers also carried out a mass safety production inspection, strengthened the maintenance and repair of weak equipment, and reduced downtime for maintenance.

    Now, the workers of this company have put forward new goals. They are determined to make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, and guarantee to increase the production of 20,000 tons of high-quality steel for the country by the end of the month, while actively preparing for the second quarter's production.
    Angang

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 6th: Hundreds of thousands of iron and steel workers in Angang are working hard to achieve the targets of responding to the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. Now, from blast furnaces to open-hearth furnaces, from rolling mills to mines, everywhere is full of enthusiasm and joy, presenting a new scene of the Great Leap Forward. From March 1st to 5th, the average daily output of these five days increased by 1,449 tons of pig iron, 93 tons of steel, and 328 tons of steel compared with February.

    After responding to the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the enthusiasm of all the workers in Angang's factories and mines was not only further increased, but also many leading cadres, from the company manager to the factory and mine directors, from the Party committee secretary to the workshop director, went deep into the production site. Some even brought their bedding and lived in the factories, fighting alongside the workers day and night. The company's first joint technical performance competition week for March has been launched fiercely. The determination letters, guarantee letters, challenge letters, and production reports of everyone striving to be a production pioneer have been flying to Party organizations at all levels in Angang.

    In order to realize the friendly competition contract signed with the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking plant, all the workers of the Angang Ironmaking Plant launched a major competition among ten blast furnaces to learn from Shigang and surpass Shigang. In this competition, the workers of No. 1 blast furnace took the lead, with the average daily output of pig iron in the first four days of March exceeding the plan by 16.37%. The workers of the other nine blast furnaces are vigorously chasing after No. 1 blast furnace, striving to be the most advanced in March production. The workers of No. 4 blast furnace adopted measures such as increasing the amount of air blown, increasing the amount of raw materials, and deepening the iron notch, and produced more than 440 tons of pig iron for the country in the first four days of March alone. The workers of the No. 10 giant blast furnace are not to be outdone. Within the first four days of March, they increased the daily output level of pig iron by 18.14% compared with February.

    Stepping into March, the steel production battle of the workers of Angang's three major steelmaking plants is even more in full swing. After the workers of the First Steelmaking Plant enthusiastically discussed the March combat plan, they held a swearing-in competition meeting for all the workers in the plant on the 4th. Representatives of each furnace and section took to the stage to compete and put forward new guarantee conditions. In the corridors of the workshops and on the walls of the open-hearth furnace operating rooms, guarantee letters and determination letters of various colors were posted everywhere. The workers of No. 9 open-hearth furnace went all out to tackle the "furnace body barrier" and produced 550 tons more high-quality steel than planned in the first four days of March. The three open-hearth furnaces of this plant started major repairs simultaneously on March 3rd. After discussion, the workers adopted the method of small-scale mechanized construction and decided to shorten the originally planned construction time by three days, so that the open-hearth furnaces could produce more high-quality steel for the country. The Second Steelmaking Plant also launched a technical innovation movement targeting key production issues. In the first five days of March, the average daily production of high-quality steel was more than 600 tons more than in February.

    The vast number of workers in the rolling steel system, raw material system, and transportation system also actively participated in the March steel production competition. The workers of Angang's thirteen rolling mills, which increased steel production by more than 67,000 tons for the country in January and February, produced 1,084 tons more steel than planned in the first five days of the March competition. The workers of the mining, sintering, coking, and transportation departments carried out a communist collaboration competition to ensure a sufficient quantity of raw materials and transportation vehicles, and promote the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel production.
    Chonggang

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 6th: After the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company responded to the Shigang initiative, the production level rapidly increased. In the first five days of March, the daily steel production level increased by 11.9% compared with the same period last month, steel production increased by 2.7%, and steel quality also greatly improved.

    Since the beginning of March, the workers of Chonggang's units have focused on the current key production issues and weak links, and vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. The workers of the large open-hearth furnace plant fought for two days and two nights, and used local methods to build a waste steel preheating furnace, which shortened the smelting time by 40 minutes. They also made a steel beating machine, which greatly improved mold release efficiency. The workers of each steelmaking plant have also achieved good results in tackling the key problems of short life and low iron melting rate of ironmaking furnaces. The life of ironmaking furnaces has been increased from more than one day in the past to more than three days. The large rolling mill focused on the four major key issues of slagging and roll breakage in gas furnaces, and vigorously carried out technical innovation, which promoted the rise in production.
    Taigang

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 6th: After the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company responded to the Shigang initiative, they adopted many effective measures to promote the step-by-step increase in production. The average daily output from March 1st to 5th increased by 12.2% in pig iron, 29% in small steel, and 3.6% in steel compared with the previous month.

    Since entering March, under the encouragement of the company's Party committee's call to align with the advanced technical and economic indicators on the national iron and steel front, the workers of Taigang have quickly launched a technical competition upsurge, with factories conducting large-scale military training and everyone performing on a large scale, filled with a leap forward atmosphere everywhere. The workers of the Second Rolling Mill carried out a technical competition centered on high quality, high yield, low roll temperature, low consumption, and safety assurance. From the 1st to the 5th, they repeatedly set ten new production records, and the average completion of the daily plan in the first five days of this month was 129%. Everyone in the First Steelmaking Plant participated in the competition, and each shift conducted evaluations, which greatly promoted production. From the 1st to the 4th, they created four new records in slag cleaning and smelting. The sintering section of the first workshop of the Ironmaking Plant debated and experimented during the competition, further breaking superstitions and liberating their minds. On the 3rd, they successfully tested the ore-wrapping sintering, which ensured the "fine grain" supply for the blast furnace.
    Yegang

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 6th: After the workers of Daye Steel Plant responded to the Shigang initiative, everyone was full of vigor and enthusiasm, and they overfulfilled the steel and iron production plans for the first five days of March. Among them, steel exceeded the quota by 3.63%, and iron exceeded the quota by 12.83%; product quality also significantly improved.

    Stepping into March, Daye Steel Plant closely integrated technical innovation and technical revolution with the completion of the national plan. They convened a five-level cadre meeting including the plant, department, workshop, section, and team. By communicating the situation, assigning tasks, handing over difficulties, and handing over methods from top to bottom, and conducting large-scale discussions, proposing plans, and setting guarantees from bottom to top, they quickly launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "fourizations" (hot air gasification, single-machine automation, production continuity, and operation mechanization) and "two sharps" (cutting-edge products, cutting-edge technologies). According to the statistics of the First and Second Steelmaking Departments and other three units alone, more than 100 major innovation proposals were put forward in the first five days of March, of which more than 30 have been successfully tested.
