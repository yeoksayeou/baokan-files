Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, March 11th: More than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Fujian Province held a grand meeting in Jimei, Xiamen today to warmly welcome the Indonesian Chinese who returned to Fujian Province on the 6th and 10th to participate in construction or study.

    The meeting was presided over by Li Wenling, Mayor of Xiamen. At the beginning of the meeting, Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, on behalf of the Fujian Provincial People's Committee and the 15 million people of the province, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the overseas Chinese who had returned to the warm embrace of the motherland after all kinds of hardships. He said: "The motherland has sufficient strength and full conditions to properly arrange your lives, work, and studies." He warmly welcomed the returned overseas Chinese to participate in socialist construction in Fujian Province, and encouraged the returned overseas Chinese to continue to carry forward the tradition of loving the motherland and the spirit of hard work, and contribute their strength to the various production and construction undertakings of the motherland.

    Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, in his speech, on behalf of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the people of the province, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the overseas Chinese who had returned to the motherland, and expressed great concern about the situation of the overseas Chinese who are still residing in Indonesia.

    After narrating the great achievements made in all aspects of Fujian Province since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Lin Yixin said: "Fujian has 120,000 square kilometers of land, fertile geology, mild climate, and mineral resources that are 'numerous, extensive, rich, and complete'. The rich mountainous areas are in urgent need of construction, and the southern Fujian area is suitable for vigorously developing the production of tropical and subtropical crops. The socialist construction undertakings in Fujian Province, whether in industry, agriculture, or science and culture, need more and more people to participate." He encouraged the returned overseas Chinese to build the great motherland and the lovely hometown of Fujian faster and better.

    Liu Changjiang, a returned overseas Chinese, spoke on behalf of all the returned overseas Chinese at the meeting. He said: We have suffered the pain of displacement overseas. Today, we are returning to the motherland to participate in construction, and we all feel extremely excited. Without the strong motherland under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, it would be impossible for us to return to the warm embrace of the motherland. In the future, we will resolutely obey the unified arrangements of the country and repay the country's care and love for us with practical actions. Li Chengqun, a representative of returned overseas Chinese students, also spoke at the meeting, expressing that in the future, they will definitely listen to the Party, study hard, strive to improve their political and ideological awareness, and strive for a triple harvest of ideology, study, and labor to repay the care of the people of the motherland.

    Also attending the meeting were Wang Hanjie, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese and Director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Wu Jinnan, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Lin Zhuguang, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Gao Jianfeng, Head of the Jinjiang Prefecture, Chen Di, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Longxi Prefecture, and heads of various departments and people's organizations in Xiamen.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, March 11th: The 1,011 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who were persecuted and came to Fujian on the second special train from Guangzhou arrived in Fujian on the 10th, disembarking in Xiamen and Zhangzhou respectively, and were warmly welcomed and cordially received by more than 6,000 people from all walks of life in the province. Together with the more than 800 returned overseas Chinese who arrived in Fujian on the 6th, they will participate in socialist construction and study in Fujian.

    On the Xiamen Gaoqi-Jimei seawall, a "Welcoming Relatives Gate" was erected, and the chest wall from the railway tracks of Jimei Railway Station to the seawall was filled with people welcoming them.

    When the train carrying this group of returned overseas Chinese arrived, people waved flowers, beat gongs and drums, set off firecrackers, and sang the song "Welcome Overseas Relatives Home." The returned overseas Chinese excitedly waved their handkerchiefs and scarves at the train windows to thank their relatives for their welcome.

    As soon as the returned overseas Chinese got off the train, Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, and Li Wenling, Mayor of Xiamen, stepped forward to warmly welcome them, shook hands with them, and talked cordially with the returned overseas Chinese along the way. When the seventy-two-year-old granny Fang Fu with white hair got off the train, she was wearing the clothes given to her by the government, and someone was helping her along the way. At this time, she was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes. Her family was driven to a dead end by powerful groups in Cirebon, Indonesia, and decided to return to China with her son, but they were repeatedly obstructed by local powerful groups. The mother and son were imprisoned in a concentration camp for more than three months and suffered all kinds of torture. When she saw Lin Yixin, she repeatedly said: "The motherland is good, the motherland is my real home, I am relieved." Lin Yixin held the old lady's hand and comforted her, saying: "Back in the motherland, you will no longer be bullied!"

    Also present at the seawall that day to welcome the overseas Chinese were Wang Hanjie, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, Lin Zhuguang, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and heads of various people's organizations and relevant departments in Xiamen. Gao Jianfeng, Deputy Commissioner of Jinjiang Prefecture, Ke Chaoyang, Deputy County Head of Tongan County, Zhang Qingguang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of Yongchun County, and others also came from afar to welcome their relatives returning from overseas.

    Another group of returned overseas Chinese who disembarked in Zhangzhou City was warmly welcomed by Hong Yezi, Secretary of the Longxi Prefectural Party Committee and Director of the Longxi Prefectural Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, Tian Zhuang, Mayor of Zhangzhou City, and more than 2,000 people from all walks of life in Longxi Prefecture. Wu Jinnan, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and Director of the Office of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, also went to welcome them.

    据新华社厦门11日电　福建省各界人民三千多人今天在厦门集美举行大会，热烈欢迎6日和10日回到福建省参加建设或学习的印度尼西亚侨胞。
    大会由厦门市市长李文陵主持。大会开始，福建省副省长陈绍宽代表福建省人民委员会和全省一千五百万人民，向历尽千辛万苦胜利回到祖国温暖怀抱的侨胞们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。他说：“祖国有足够的力量和充分的条件，来妥善安排你们的生活、工作和学习。”他热烈欢迎归侨们到福建省参加社会主义建设，勉励归侨们继续发扬热爱祖国的传统和勤劳的精神，为祖国各项生产建设事业贡献自己的力量。

    林一心在叙述了福建省解放十年来特别是1958年大跃进以来各方面所取得的巨大成就以后说：“福建有十二万平方公里的土地，地质肥沃，气候温和，矿藏资源‘多、广、富、全’，富饶的山区亟待建设，闽南地区适合于大力发展热带和亚热带作物的生产。福建省的社会主义建设事业，无论工业、农业或科学文化等事业，都需要有越来越多的人参加。”他勉励归侨们把伟大的祖国和可爱的家乡——福建建设得更快更好。
    归侨刘长江代表全体归侨在会上讲话。他说：我们在海外受到流离失所之苦，今天回到祖国参加建设，莫不感到万分的兴奋。如果没有中国共产党和毛主席英明领导的强大祖国作靠山，我们是不可能回到祖国的温暖怀抱的。今后我们坚决服从国家的统一安排，用实际行动来报答祖国对我们的关怀和爱护。归侨学生代表李承群也在会上讲话，表示今后一定听党的话，认真学习，努力提高政治思想觉悟，争取思想、学习、劳动三丰收，来报答祖国人民的关怀。

    据新华社厦门11日电　从广州乘第二列专车来福建的在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的一千零十一名归国华侨，10日到达福建，分别在厦门、漳州下车，受到全省各界人民六千多人的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。他们将和6日到达福建的八百多名归国华侨一起，在福建参加社会主义建设和学习。
    厦门高（崎）集（美）海堤上，竖立着“迎亲门”，从集美火车站的铁轨旁到海堤的胸墙上，站满欢迎的人群。
    当载着这批归国华侨的火车开来的时候，人们挥舞鲜花，敲着锣鼓，燃放鞭炮，唱着“欢迎海外亲人归来”的歌曲。归侨们在车窗口激动地挥动着手帕、围巾，感谢亲人的欢迎。
    归国华侨们一下车，中共福建省委书记处书记、福建省接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任林一心，福建省副省长陈绍宽，厦门市市长李文陵等都上前热情欢迎，和他们握手，一路上和归国华侨亲切的谈叙。头发苍白的七十二岁大娘方富下车时，身上穿的是政府送给她的衣服，一路上有人扶着她走，这时她激动得热泪满眶。她一家人在印度尼西亚井里汶曾被有势力集团逼得无路可走，才决心和儿子回国，但又横遭当地有势力集团百般阻挠，母子俩被关到集中营三个多月，受尽了折磨。她见到林一心时连声说：“祖国好，祖国是我真正的家，我放心了。”林一心拉着大娘的手，安慰她说：“回到祖国，再也不受人欺负了！”
