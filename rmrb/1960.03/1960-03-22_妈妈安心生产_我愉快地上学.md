    Mom Can Focus on Production, I Can Happily Go to School
    In 1958, my mom left home and joined production. To allow her to focus on production, I started helping with household chores. I cooked for my mom, took my younger brother to kindergarten, and sometimes helped tidy up the house, fetch water, and wash clothes. Because I was slow, I often missed school, which made me anxious and affected my studies.
    Soon, a street canteen was established near my home, which was great! Every morning, my mom and I ate a hot meal at the canteen, then she went to the street factory while I went to school without any worry. After class, I played table tennis with my classmates and happily participated in extracurricular activities. I finished my homework early almost every day and read many extracurricular books like "Railway Guerrilla" and "Red Flag Fluttering." My grades improved day by day, and I was soon selected as the flag bearer of the Young Pioneers.
    The street canteen has brought me many benefits. I must study hard and strive to be an excellent student to repay the Party and Chairman Mao for their care for us.

    妈妈安心生产　我愉快地上学
    1958年，我妈妈走出家门，参加了生产。我为了使妈妈一心生产，开始帮着做些家里的零杂活。我帮妈妈做饭，送小弟弟上幼儿园，有时还帮着收拾屋子，打水洗衣裳。因为我动作慢，常常赶不上上学，心里着急，影响了一些功课。
    不久我家附近成立了街道食堂，这下子可好啦！每天早上，我和妈妈在食堂吃过热腾腾的饭后，妈妈上街道工厂，我安安心心的去上学。课后和同学们打乒乓球，愉快地参加课外活动。每天的作业，我差不多都提早做完，还看了“铁道游击队”“红旗飘飘”等许多课外书籍，我的学习成绩一天比一天好，不久被选为少先队的旗手。
    街道食堂给我带来了很多好处，我一定要好好学习，争取做一个优秀生，来报答党和毛主席对我们的关怀。
