The Japanese Government Opens the Door
Massive Influx of American Capital

In Japan, due to the Kishida Nobusuke government's policy of opening the door to American capital, American private capital is pouring into Japan in large quantities, seriously threatening Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises.

According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the largest American starch manufacturer, Corn Products Refining Company, is currently planning to sign contracts with the Japanese companies "Ajinomoto" and "Toyo Seikan" to establish a glucose manufacturing company in Japan with a capital of 200 million yen. It is currently applying to the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry for approval.

Under the guise of "Japan-U.S. economic cooperation," the Kishida Nobusuke government recently implemented so-called "trade liberalization," relaxing restrictions on foreign investment in Japan. This has opened the way for further penetration of American capital into Japan. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," from April to October of last year, the total amount of foreign capital investment in Japan (including shares, corporate bonds, etc.), with the United States accounting for the largest proportion, was 82.5 billion yen. Since 1949, the total amount of foreign capital investment in Japan has been 261.7 billion yen.

The newspaper pointed out that, as of the end of last year, among the 208 Japanese companies in various industries that have absorbed foreign capital, there were already 44 companies in which foreign capital accounted for more than 50% of the total shares.

Since the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," American capital has further intensified its pace of penetration into Japan. American monopoly capital is using its existing technical agreements with Japanese companies in an attempt to make the Japanese economy even more subordinate to itself.

According to the United Press International publication "Trends and Observations," 70% of the technical agreements signed by Japanese companies with foreign companies last year were signed with American companies. The number of joint ventures is increasing. The bulletin pointed out that there are currently more than 20 companies requesting permission to establish Japan-U.S. joint ventures.

Japanese commentators believe that what is particularly evident is that foreign companies are stepping up their efforts to buy up shares in Japanese companies.

### 日本政府门户开放  美国资本大量入侵

    日本政府门户开放
    美国资本大量入侵
    在日本，由于岸信介政府执行了为美国资本开放门户的政策，美国私人资本正在大量涌入日本，使日本的中小企业遭到严重威胁。
    据“日本经济新闻”报道，美国最大的淀粉制造商谷物加工公司目前正在计划同日本“味之素”、“东洋制罐”两个公司签订合同，准备在日本设立一家二亿日元资本的葡萄糖制造公司，为此正在向日本通商产业省申请批准。
    岸信介政府最近在“日美经济合作”的名义下，实行所谓“贸易自由化”，放宽了外国在日投资的限制。这为美国资本进一步渗入日本打开了道路。据“朝日新闻”报道，从去年4月到10月，以美国为大宗的外国资本的对日投资总额（包括股分、公司债券等）共有八百二十五亿日元，而从1949年以来的外国资本的对日投资总额为二千六百一十七亿日元。
    这家报纸指出，截至去年年底为止，吸收外国资本的日本二百零八个各行业公司中，外国资本占总股份50％以上的公司已经有四十四家。
    新日美“安全条约”签字以后，美国资本更加加紧了向日本渗入的步伐。美国垄断资本利用它同日本公司的现有的技术协定企图使日本经济更加从属于自己。
    据联合通讯社出版的“动向和观察”公报说，去年日本公司同外国公司签订的技术协定有70％是同美国公司签订的。合股公司的数目正在增加。公报指出，目前要求允许开办日美合股企业的公司已有二十多家。
    日本评论员们认为，表现特别明显的是，外国公司正在加紧收买日本企业的股票。
