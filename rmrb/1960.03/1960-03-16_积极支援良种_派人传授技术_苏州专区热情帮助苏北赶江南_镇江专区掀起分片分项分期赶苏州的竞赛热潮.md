Actively Support Improved Varieties, Send Personnel to Impart Technology
    Suzhou Prefecture Enthusiastically Helps Northern Jiangsu Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu
    Zhenjiang Prefecture Launches a Competition Craze to Catch Up with Suzhou in Stages, Sections, and Items

    (Our dispatch) The four million people of Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are promoting the spirit of communism by comprehensively supporting the people of Northern Jiangsu in terms of manpower, materials, and technology. They are helping the people of Northern Jiangsu, who are currently competing with them, to overcome difficulties and improve their farming skills and production levels.
    Suzhou Prefecture is a region in Jiangsu Province with a relatively high level of cultivation and production. It has a long-standing habit of intensive farming, and grain yields have been high for many years. Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, following the competition movement of studying and catching up with Suzhou launched by Nantong, Xuzhou, Huaiyin and other prefectures, Yancheng, Zhenjiang and other prefectures have launched a magnificent mass movement to catch up with Southern Jiangsu and surpass Suzhou. Amidst the calls to catch up, the people of Suzhou Prefecture, with even greater enthusiasm, launched a new high tide of comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. They are determined to reach new heights; at the same time, they regard helping the people of Northern Jiangsu catch up with them as a glorious obligation. In the past few years, the people of Suzhou have supported Northern Jiangsu with hundreds of millions of catties of improved varieties of rice, wheat, rapeseed, etc., and have sent thousands of experienced farmers and technicians to help the people of Northern Jiangsu cultivate rice and improve rice management techniques for a long time. The people of Southern and Northern Jiangsu have forged a close communist cooperative friendship.
    This year, the people of Suzhou have loudly put forward the slogan "Support Northern Jiangsu to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu," and are supporting the people of Northern Jiangsu in all aspects. In order to quickly catch up with the grain production level of Suzhou, Yancheng region decided this year to change more than 3.7 million mu of indica rice to japonica rice, but lacked a large amount of improved rice varieties. The people of Suzhou immediately selected improved varieties from the best commercial grain, and supported Yancheng Prefecture with 26.5 million catties of Huangkezao early rice improved varieties. At the same time, they also supported Yangzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang and other prefectures with more than 48.8 million catties of improved rice varieties. In order to quickly transport more than 70 million catties of improved varieties to various parts of Northern Jiangsu for timely sowing, Suzhou Prefecture mobilized all the porters in the region in the face of difficulties in spring plowing production labor and transportation, and went all out to help pack and transport the seeds.
    When visiting delegations from various parts of Northern Jiangsu came to Suzhou to visit, from the prefectural committee to the county committee, the commune party committee, the production team, and even the masses, they enthusiastically and unreservedly introduced various production experiences and various cultivation techniques for wheat (barley, naked barley, wheat), rice, etc. When the Yancheng Prefecture delegation visited Jiangyin County, the hometown of the "Huangkezao" improved rice variety, Dai Xinshi, the first secretary of the county party committee, explained in detail how the county party committee grasped key factors for increasing production such as season, stubble arrangement, fertilizer, and seeds, and the "five earlies" experience of early heading, early transplanting, early fertilization, early processing, and early harvesting of rice.
    In order to more effectively help Northern Jiangsu improve its farming skills, Suzhou Prefecture, according to the requirements of various parts of Northern Jiangsu, has selected nearly 500 farmers who are ideologically sound, physically strong, and have rich experience in growing rice and making grass pond mud to cross the Yangtze River and go to Yancheng, Yangzhou, Nantong and other places in Northern Jiangsu to impart production techniques. From planting to harvesting, they cultivated rice and spread technology together with the people of Northern Jiangsu, and helped the farmers of Northern Jiangsu cultivate a technical team for rice cultivation through methods such as masters teaching apprentices, learning by doing, and teaching while doing.
    The people of Suzhou Prefecture not only support and help the people of Northern Jiangsu, but also earnestly learn from the enthusiasm and production experience of the people of Northern Jiangsu and other regions, humbly listen to and solicit opinions from all parties, learn from others' strengths, and make up for their own shortcomings, so as to continuously promote production and improve production. Changshu and Jiangyin counties, which have the highest grain yields in this prefecture, sent county party secretaries to lead commune party secretaries to Yangzhong County, Zhenjiang Prefecture, to visit and learn advanced experiences such as leveling land, garden-like cultivation, and standardized wheat field management. After visiting the Hongqiao Brigade of Youfang Commune in Yangzhong County, the cadres of the First Brigade of Zhitang Commune in Changshu County immediately took the Hongqiao Brigade as a model to learn from, and adopted methods such as production brigade cadres being responsible for plots, production team cadres being responsible for weirs, and "field leaders" being responsible for fields to vigorously promote the gardening of wheat field management. When accompanying the visiting delegation from Jintan County, Zhenjiang Prefecture, the comrades in Jiangyin County solicited more than 20 constructive opinions and convened a telephone conference to implement them.

    (Our dispatch) The five million people of Zhenjiang Prefecture, Jiangsu, have launched a competition craze to catch up with Suzhou in stages, sections, and items, and to exceed Suzhou in agricultural and sideline income.
    Zhenjiang Prefecture is a close neighbor of Suzhou Prefecture. Although most of the area is hilly and mountainous, the water sources, fertilizers, soil quality, and cultivation level are not as good as those of Suzhou. However, encouraged by the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the cadres and masses in the region have further established their determination to completely change the face of the hilly and mountainous areas, and have established their ambition to quickly catch up with and surpass the production level of the Suzhou region. After discussion, the cadres and masses in the region fully recognized the favorable conditions for catching up with Suzhou. In the mountainous areas, the benefits of mountains and rivers can be greatly developed; in the polder townships and plains, the conditions in most areas are not inferior to those in Suzhou, and the low-lying fields in some areas are even less than those in Suzhou Prefecture, which is conducive to flood control and lowering the groundwater level. On the basis of mobilizing cadres and the masses for discussion, the CPC Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee loudly put forward the slogan "Catch up with Suzhou this year, walk shoulder to shoulder next year, and lead the way the year after," and quickly launched a competition craze of "learning from Suzhou, catching up with Suzhou, and exceeding Suzhou in agricultural and sideline income." Various places have also determined specific steps to catch up with and surpass Suzhou in stages, sections, and items according to their own conditions.
    In order to strive to catch up with and surpass Suzhou in the short term, the Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee has adopted four major revolutionary measures in light of the characteristics of the region, namely, vigorously carrying out water conservancy construction, vigorously grasping pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, adjusting crop layout, and developing diversified economies.
    Since the mass movement of catching up with and surpassing Suzhou has been vigorously carried out, a brand-new situation has emerged in production. The broad masses of cadres and masses are vigorously engaged in farmland capital construction such as water, fertilizer, and soil. The 400,000-strong water conservancy army in the region has boosted its enthusiasm again and again, and the average daily work efficiency per person has increased from the original 1.6 cubic meters to more than 4 cubic meters, and the daily progress of earthwork in the region has jumped from the original 500,000 cubic meters to more than 2.5 million cubic meters. In one and a half months, more than 2,300 pig farms and more than 80,000 new pig houses have been built in the region, and more than 700,000 pigs have been raised. Now every commune and team in the region has a collective pig farm. While vigorously grasping pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, all localities have launched a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movement to vigorously create grass pond mud and accumulate natural fertilizers. In one month, the region has accumulated and produced more than 26.7 million dan of refined and crude fertilizers, and the average base fertilizer for each mu of spring and summer crops has reached more than 38 dan.
    In order to make agricultural and sideline income quickly catch up with and exceed Suzhou Prefecture, all localities have made full use of the favorable conditions of hilly and mountainous areas to vigorously develop mountainous areas and develop diversified operations.
    In the movement to catch up with and surpass Suzhou, the entire region organized 500,000 people, and after a seven-day assault, 300,000 mu of wheat were universally top-dressed with green fertilizer once, with 60 dan of top-dressing fertilizer per mu. Now the wheat seedlings are growing green and lush, and the growth is better than in any previous year. Under the slogan of "Leading with the word 'early' and taking the initiative in everything," all localities are comprehensively preparing for spring plowing and production. All localities are proceeding from reality to vigorously carry out contiguous planting, reclaim wasteland, and expand the autumn sowing area.

    苏州专区热情帮助苏北赶江南
    镇江专区掀起分片分项分期赶苏州的竞赛热潮
    本报讯　江苏省苏州专区四百万人民发扬共产主义精神，在人力、物力和技术上全面支援苏北人民，帮助正同他们竞赛的苏北人民克服困难，提高耕作技术水平和生产水平。
    苏州专区是江苏省耕作水平和生产水平较高的一个地区，素有精耕细作习惯，历年来粮食产量较高。从大跃进的1958年起，继南通、徐州、淮阴等专区开展学苏州赶苏州的竞赛运动以后，盐城、镇江等专区又掀起了气势壮阔的赶江南、超苏州的群众运动。苏州专区人民在一片追赶声中，以更大的干劲，掀起了农林牧副渔全面跃进的新高潮，他们立志要更上一重天；同时把帮助苏北人民赶上自己当作一项光荣的义务。几年来，苏州人民支援了苏北各地上亿斤水稻、小麦、油菜等良种，派了数千名有经验的农民和技术员长期地帮助苏北人民栽培水稻，提高水稻管理技术，苏南苏北人民已结下了亲密的共产主义协作友谊。
    今年，苏州人民响亮地提出“支援苏北赶江南”的口号，从各方面支援苏北人民。盐城地区为了迅速赶上苏州地区的粮食生产水平，今年决定将三百七十多万亩籼稻改为粳稻，但是缺少大量的水稻良种。苏州人民马上从最好的商品粮中选出良种，共支援盐城专区黄壳早水稻良种二千六百五十万斤。同时，还支援扬州、南通、镇江等专区的水稻良种四千八百八十多万斤。为了使七千多万斤良种迅速运到苏北各地，适时播种，苏州专区各地在春耕生产劳力、运输等困难的情况下，动员了全区全部搬运工人，全力以赴，帮助装包起运。
    苏北各地的参观团来苏州地区参观时，从地委到县委、公社党委、生产队以至群众，都热情地毫无保留地介绍各种生产经验和三麦（大麦、元麦、小麦）、水稻等各项栽培技术。盐城专区参观团在“黄壳早”水稻良种家乡的江阴县参观时，县委第一书记戴心思详细地介绍了县委如何抓季节、抓茬口搭配、抓肥料、抓种子等重要增产关键和早落谷、早移栽、早施肥、早加工、早搁稻的“五早”经验。
    为了更有效地帮助苏北地区提高耕作技术水平，苏州专区根据苏北各地的要求，已经挑选出近五百名思想好、身体健壮、有丰富种植水稻经验和制造草塘泥经验的农民跨过长江，奔赴苏北的盐城、扬州、南通等地传授生产技术。他们从种到收，和苏北人民一道培植水稻，传播技术，并通过师傅带徒弟等方法，边做边教，帮助苏北农民培养一支水稻栽培的技术队伍。
    苏州专区人民不但支援和帮助苏北人民，还认真地学习苏北地区和其他地区人民的干劲和生产经验，虚心听取和征求各方面的意见，取人之长，补己之短，不断地促进生产，提高生产。这个专区粮食产量最高的常熟、江阴等县，都由县委书记带领公社党委书记到镇江专区扬中县参观学习平整土地、园田化和麦田管理规格化等先进经验。常熟县支塘公社第一大队的干部到扬中县油坊公社红桥大队参观学习后，立即以红桥大队为学习榜样，采取生产大队干部包片、生产小队干部包圩、“田长”包田的办法，大搞麦田管理园艺化。江阴县的同志在陪同镇江专区金坛县参观团参观时，征求了二十多条建设性意见，就召开电话会议，进行贯彻。
    本报讯　江苏镇江专区五百万人民掀起了分片、分项、分期赶苏州，农副业收入超苏州的竞赛热潮。
    镇江专区是苏州专区的紧壁近邻，虽然全区大部分是丘陵山区，水源、肥料、土质以及耕作水平都不及苏州。但是，在取得连续两年大跃进的鼓舞下，全区干部群众进一步确立了彻底改变丘陵山区面貌的决心，树立了迅速赶上和超过苏州地区生产水平的雄心壮志。全区干部和群众经过讨论，充分认识到赶苏州的有利条件。在山区可以大兴山水之利；在圩乡和平原，大部分地区的条件也不亚于苏州，有些地区的低洼田还比苏州专区少一些，有利于防涝和降低地下水位。中共镇江地委在发动干部群众讨论的基础上，根据本地区的条件，响亮地提出了“今年赶苏州，明年并肩走，后年走前头”的口号，迅速掀起了“学苏州、赶苏州、农副业收入超苏州”的竞赛热潮。各地又都根据自己的条件，确定了分片分项分期赶苏州、超苏州的具体步骤。
    为了争取短期内赶上和超过苏州，镇江地委根据本地区的特点，采取了四大革命措施，即大搞水利建设，大抓养猪积肥、调整作物布局和发展多种经济。
    赶苏州超苏州的群众运动蓬勃开展以后，生产上出现了一个崭新的局面。广大干部群众大搞水、肥、土等农田基本建设。全区四十万水利大军，干劲一鼓再鼓，平均每人每天工效由原来的一点六方提高到四方以上，全区土方日进度由原来五十万方跃增到二百五十多万方。全区一个半月建造猪场二千三百多个，新建猪舍八万多间，增养生猪七十多万头，现在全区社社队队都有集体养猪场。各地在大抓养猪积肥的同时，开展了规模壮阔的大造草塘泥大积自然肥料的积肥造肥运动，全区一个月中积造精粗肥料就达二万六千七百多担，平均每亩春播和夏播作物的基肥已达三十八担多。
    为了使农副业收入迅速赶上和超过苏州专区，各地都充分利用丘陵山区的有利条件，大力开发山区，发展多种经营。
    在赶苏州超苏州的运动中，全区组织五十万人，经过七天突击，三十万亩的麦子普遍追施了一次返青肥，每亩追肥六十多担，现在麦苗生长一片油绿，长势胜过以往任何一年。各地在“早字领先，万事主动”的口号下，全面做好春耕生产的各项准备。各地都因地制宜，大搞连片种植，开垦荒地，扩大秋播面积。
