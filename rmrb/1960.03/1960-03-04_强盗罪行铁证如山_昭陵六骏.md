    Ironclad Evidence of Robbery
    The Six Steeds of Zhaoling
    Shou Jin

    The world-renowned Six Steeds of Zhaoling are precious cultural relics of China's 600 million people and treasures in the history of world art. However, the American imperialists actually chiseled them and stole the two best ones, Saluzi and Quanmaogua, to the United States. These two stolen goods are now hidden in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia.

    Zhaoling is the tomb of Emperor Taizong Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty, located on Jiuzong Mountain in Qian County, Shaanxi (formerly Liquan County). The Tang Dynasty was the heyday of China's feudal society, and the stone carvings in the mausoleum also reflected the magnificent and powerful characteristics of this era. The Six Steeds are stone bas-reliefs in the Xuanwu Gate of Zhaoling, divided into east and west rows, with three in each row. According to "Ce fu yuan gui," these six steeds were the six steeds that Li Shimin rode in the wars to establish the Tang Empire. Li Shimin cherished the achievements of these warhorses, so he carved statues to commemorate them.

    "Jin Shi Lu" states that there were also eulogies written by Li Shimin on the stone horses, and the words were written by Ouyang Xun, a great calligrapher of the early Tang Dynasty. The blank space on the horse's head is where the eulogy was engraved. However, after more than a thousand years of wind and rain erosion, the handwriting is difficult to identify. The "Chang'an Zhi" and "Quan Tang Wen" both record the eulogies of the Six Steeds. From these records, we know that the first horse on the east side is called Tele Biao, which was ridden during the battle with Song Jingang; the second horse is called Qingzhui, which was ridden during the battle with Dou Jiande; the third horse is called Shifa Chi, which was ridden during the battle with Wang Shichong and Dou Jiande; the first horse on the west side is called Saluzi, which was ridden during the attack on Luoyang; the second horse is called Quanmaogua, which was ridden during the battle with Liu Heita; the third horse is called Baitiwu, which was ridden during the battle with Xue Rengao.

    The Saluzi in the picture is the best-carved of the Six Steeds and the only one with a human figure. The "Tang Shu: Biography of Qiu Xinggong" records the story of this horse: Li Shimin and Wang Shichong fought on Mangshan Mountain in Luoyang. He wanted to test the opponent's strength, so he led dozens of cavalry out of the battle. During the fight, the accompanying cavalry was scattered, and only Qiu Xinggong accompanied him. Wang Shichong's troops chased after them and shot Li Shimin's horse. Qiu Xinggong bravely shot in all directions, and the pursuers dared not approach. Qiu Xinggong pulled out the arrows from the horse's body and gave his horse to Li Shimin, and alone took a long knife and broke through the siege on foot to return to the formation. Later, in order to commend his meritorious service, Li Shimin specially engraved the scene of pulling out the arrow on the stone.

    In the stone carving, the horse's drooping head and the person's movements express a kind of intimate feeling. The decorations of the person and the horse are also described very realistically. The armor and battle robe worn by the person, and the sword and Hulijing (arrow bag) worn, are the attire of ordinary warriors in the Tang Dynasty. Cutting the horse's mane into three braids was also a fashion at the time, called Sanhua.

    The other five statues, Quanmaogua and Tele Biao, show the slow walking posture of the horses, and the other three show the galloping posture of the horses, all of which are very powerful. When the horse gallops, its four feet rise, its muscles are tense, and its nostrils are panting, which is very expressive.

    The Six Steeds of Zhaoling are one of the representative works of depicting horses in the Han and Tang Dynasties, and it reflects the artistic tradition of realism in our country.

    强盗罪行铁证如山
    昭陵六骏
    寿晋
    举世闻名的昭陵六骏，是我国六亿人民的珍贵文物，也是世界艺术史上的瑰宝。然而，美帝国主义者竟然将它们凿坏，并将其中最好的两座，飒露紫和拳毛騧盗运到美国。现在这两件赃物正窝藏在费城大学博物馆。
    昭陵是唐太宗李世民的坟墓，座落在陕西乾县（原醴泉县）的九嵕山。唐代是我国封建社会的鼎盛时期，陵中的石雕也反映了这个时代的雄伟和强盛的特色。六骏是昭陵玄武门内的石浮雕，分东西两列，每列三座。根据“册府元龟”，这六骏就是李世民在建立唐帝国的战争中所乘的六匹骏马。李世民追念这些战马的功绩，所
  以刻像来作纪念。
    “金石录”说，石马上还有李世民作的赞语，字是初唐的大书法家欧阳询写的。现在马头上的一块空白处，就是刻赞语的地方。不过，经过一千多年风雨的侵蚀，字迹已难以辨认了。“长安志”和“全唐文”中都录有六骏的赞语。从这些记载，知道东面第一匹叫特勒骠，是和宋金刚作战时乘的；第二匹叫青骓，是和窦建德作战时乘的；第三匹叫什伐赤，是和王世充、窦建德作战时乘的；西面第一匹叫飒露紫，是攻洛阳时乘的；第二匹叫拳毛騧，是和刘黑闼作战时乘的；第三匹叫白蹄乌，是和薛仁杲作战时乘的。
    图片上的飒露紫是六骏中雕刻得最好，也是唯一有人像的一座。“唐书”“丘行恭传”记有这匹马的故事：李世民和王世充在洛阳邙山作战，他想试探对方的虚实，率领数十骑出阵。在格斗中，随从的骑兵失散了，只有丘行恭随行。王世充的部队追来，射中李世民的马，丘行恭奋勇四射，追兵都不敢近。丘行恭便将马身上的箭拔出，并将自己的马让给李世民，独自拿着长刀，徒步突围回阵，后来李世民为着表彰功劳，特地将拔箭的情形刻在石上。
    石刻中，马的垂头和人的动作，表达了一种亲切的感情。人和马的装饰也描写得很真实。人着的甲胄和战袍，佩的刀和胡錄（箭袋），是唐代一般武士的装束。将马鬃剪成三辫，也是当时的一种风尚，叫做三花。
    其他五座雕像，拳毛騧和特勒骠表现了马缓步行进的神态，另外三座表现了马的奔驰神态，都十分强劲有力。马奔驰时，四足腾起，筋肉紧张，鼻孔喘息，极富于表现力。
    昭陵六骏是汉唐两代描写马的代表作之一，它反映了我国现实主义的艺术传统。
