    Grasp Production and Transportation Together
    Today, this newspaper publishes news about how the Beijing Guanghua Wood Factory has grasped both production and transportation, completely solving the factory's internal transportation problems and ensuring continued leaps forward in production. This is one of many similar cases in recent times. This event provides successful experiences for solving the current contradiction between production and transportation, and is worthy of attention from comrades engaged in industrial and mining work and those engaged in transportation work.
    Internal factory and mine transportation is an important component of enterprise production and an important part of the entire transportation industry. It connects various production workshops internally and connects with transportation trunk lines externally, having a significant impact on both enterprise production and overall transportation. Enterprise production begins with transportation, is linked by transportation, and ends with transportation. Production can only begin when raw materials and fuel are transported in; the unified production process carried out by various workshops can only be sustained by continuous transportation; the entire production process of any enterprise is only completed when its products are transferred to another production field as means of production, or transferred to the consumer field as commodities. For the entire transportation industry, internal factory transportation is the overture and epilogue of trunk line transportation. Large numbers of empty vehicles come here to load goods, and large numbers of loaded vehicles come here to unload goods. If internal factory transportation is not done well, goods cannot be loaded or unloaded, which affects the acceleration of vehicle turnover and the smooth flow of trunk line transportation.
    Strengthening internal factory transportation is an urgent issue for ensuring the leap forward in enterprise production and ensuring the smooth flow of overall transportation. The production of many of our original factories and mines has developed rapidly, but the internal transportation of some factories and mines cannot meet the needs of large-scale production development. Although newly built modern large enterprises mostly have corresponding transportation systems and relatively advanced transportation equipment, the production of these modern large enterprises has developed extremely rapidly in the two years of continuous great leaps forward. Some factories are equivalent to two or even several factories, and this has also resulted in a situation where internal transportation is not adapted. Newly built small and medium-sized enterprises, especially small enterprises, during the Great Leap Forward, mostly did not have time to strengthen the construction of internal factory transportation in the past, and mainly used manual handling. With the transition of "small indigenous groups" to "small modern groups," the construction of internal factory transportation in these enterprises has also become an increasingly urgent issue in production. From the perspective of the development of the entire transportation industry, with the expansion of the transportation network and the strengthening of transportation planning and organization, the connection between the local and the overall is closer, and the impact of internal factory transportation on trunk line transportation is greater. The blockage of a station or a wharf often affects the transportation of one or even several lines. With the great development of factory production, internal factory transportation has temporarily become a weak link, which is a difficulty in the process of advancement. As long as we are determined to tap potential and engage in mass transportation, difficulties can certainly be overcome. At the same time, solving the transportation problem will inevitably greatly promote the development of production. The experiences of Guanghua Wood Factory and other factories fully prove this.
    The experiences of Guanghua Wood Factory and other enterprises prove that internal factory transportation can quickly keep up with the development of the situation of production leap forward. Here, the most important issue is that enterprise leaders must establish the idea of "grasping production and transportation together," and must have corresponding organizational measures. In the past, some comrades believed that "the task of the enterprise is to manage production, and transportation is a matter for the transportation department." They did not regard transportation as an important link in the production process, but as something outside of production. Therefore, in building factories and arranging production, they often neglected transportation conditions, and did not check transportation conditions when inspecting production. Now, the huge impact of transportation on production has been recognized by more and more comrades. However, some comrades often place the responsibility for solving internal factory transportation problems on professional transportation departments. Of course, professional transportation departments have the responsibility to support the production of factories and mines as much as possible, and also have the responsibility to help factories and mines build and manage internal transportation systems. However, enterprise transportation is ultimately the enterprise's own business. Only by grasping it ourselves, and grasping transportation like grasping production, can internal factory transportation be done well, and can the continued leap forward in production be guaranteed. Of course, internal factory and mine transportation is a regular work, which cannot be done well by holding a few meetings. The important thing is to have practical organizational measures to implement the simultaneous grasp of production and transportation. It now appears that it is entirely necessary for enterprises to establish special transportation management agencies, and for large factories and large basic construction sites to establish full-time transportation deputy factory directors and transportation deputy managers. Leaders of small and medium-sized enterprises must also have someone assigned to manage transportation. The enterprise's party organization must strengthen its leadership over transportation and have someone specifically responsible for transportation work. This is not only an organizational measure for doing a good job in internal factory transportation, but also a political guarantee for doing a good job in internal factory transportation.
    From what aspects should internal factory transportation be strengthened? The experiences of Guanghua Wood Factory and other enterprises prove that the most important thing is to carry out a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, and to engage in large-scale transportation construction. The reason why internal factory transportation lags behind the development of enterprise production, in addition to ideological and organizational reasons, is that the most important thing is that equipment is backward and relies mainly on manual labor. Without a radical technological innovation and technological revolution, the face of internal factory transportation cannot be fundamentally changed. Is it possible to engage in large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution in internal factory transportation and rapidly change the face of internal factory transportation? Yes, it is. We already have the experience of running indigenous railways and small modern railways on a large scale, the experience of vehicularization, cablewayization, and river transportationization, and the experience of mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading. As long as we adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs," relying on our own efforts, combining modern and indigenous methods, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and continuously improving and developing from low to high, the situation where internal factory transportation lags behind production development will inevitably change quickly. The Beijing Guanghua Wood Factory is one example, and the rapid realization of mechanized and semi-mechanized internal factory transportation in factories and mines throughout Tianjin is also an example.
    Now, the spearhead of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is pointing at the backward links that are the most labor-intensive, use the most people, and have the greatest impact on production. Internal factory transportation is precisely one of these backward links. Let us take advantage of this great opportunity, grasp production and transportation together, and let internal factory transportation have a great revolution!

### 生产运输一齐抓

    生产运输一齐抓
    今天本报发表了北京光华木材厂一手抓生产、一手抓运输，使厂内运输问题全部得到解决，保证了生产继续跃进的新闻。这是最近一个时期许多同类事例中的一个。这件事情，为解决当前生产和运输的矛盾提供了成功的经验，很值得做工矿工作的同志和做运输工作的同志注意。
    厂矿内运输是企业生产的一个重要组成部分，也是整个运输事业的一个重要组成部分。它内连各个生产车间，外接运输干线，对于企业的生产和整个的运输都有很大的影响。企业的生产从运输开始，以运输为纽带，也以运输为终结。只有把原料、材料、燃料运进来，生产才能开始；只有依靠不间断的运输，才能把由各个车间分工进行的统一的生产过程持续下去；任何企业的产品，也只有当它作为生产资料转移到另一个生产领域，或是作为商品转移到消费领域的时候，它的全部生产过程才算结束。对于整个运输事业说来，厂内运输是干线运输的序曲和尾声。大批空车来这里装货，大批重车到这里卸货。厂内运输搞得不好，装不上车，卸不下货，都影响着车辆周转的加速和干线运输的畅通。
    加强厂内运输，对于保证企业生产的跃进，对于保证整个运输的畅通，都是一个迫切的问题。我们许多原有的工厂矿山，生产发展得很快，但是，有些厂矿的厂内运输却不能适应生产大发展的需要。新建的现代化大企业虽然大都有相应的运输系统，有比较先进的运输设备，但在两年的连续大跃进中，这些现代化大企业的生产发展极快，有的一个厂顶两个厂，甚至顶几个厂，这样，也出现了厂内运输不相适应的情况。大跃进中新建的中小型企业，特别是小型企业，在过去的一段时间中，大都没有来得及加强厂内运输的建设，主要是采用人工搬运。随着“小土群”向“小洋群”过渡，这些企业厂内运输的建设，也日益成为生产中的迫切问题。就整个运输事业的发展情况来看，随着运输网的扩大和运输计划性、组织性的加强，局部和整体的联系更加密切了，厂内运输对于干线运输的影响也更大了，一个车站，一个码头的堵塞，常常影响一条、甚至几条线路的运输。工厂生产大发展，厂内运输暂时成了薄弱的环节，这是前进中的困难。只要我们下定决心挖掘潜力，大搞群众运输，困难就一定能够被克服，同时，解决了运输的问题，也必然会大大促进生产的发展。光华木材厂以及其他工厂的经验完全证明了这一点。
    光华木材厂等企业的经验证明，厂内运输是可以迅速跟上生产跃进的形势发展的。这里，最重要的问题是，企业领导干部要树立“生产运输一齐抓”的思想，并且要有相应的组织措施。过去有个时期，有些同志认为“企业的任务是管生产，运输是运输部门的事情”。他们不把运输看作是生产过程的一个重要环节，而把运输看作是生产以外的事情，因而建设工厂、布置生产，常常忽视运输条件，检查生产情况也不检查运输情况。现在运输对生产的巨大影响已经被愈来愈多的同志认识到了。但是，有些同志却常常把解决厂内运输问题的责任，放在专业运输部门的身上。当然，专业运输部门有责任尽一切可能支援厂矿企业的生产，也有责任帮助厂矿企业建设和管理厂内运输系统。但是，企业的运输毕竟是企业自己的事情，只有自己抓起来，像抓生产一样地抓运输，厂内运输才能办好，生产继续跃进才有保证。当然，厂矿内运输是一项经常工作，并不是开几次会，就能办好的；重要的是要有切实的组织措施来贯彻生产运输一齐抓。现在看来，企业内部建立专管运输的机构，大的工厂、大的基本建设工地，设立专职的运输副厂长、运输副经理，是完全必要的。中小企业的领导干部中也要有人分工管运输。企业的党组织更要加强对运输的领导，并且有专人来负责运输工作。这不仅是办好厂内运输的组织措施，更是办好厂内运输的政治保证。
    从哪些方面加强厂内运输呢？光华木材厂等企业的经验证明，最重要的是开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，大搞交通建设。厂内运输所以落后于企业生产的发展，除了思想上、组织上的原因之外，最重要的就是设备落后，主要依靠手工劳动，没有一个翻天复地的技术革新和技术革命，厂内运输的面貌是不可能根本改观的。大搞厂内运输的技术革新和技术革命，迅速改变厂内运输的面貌，有没有可能呢？有的。我们已经有了大办土铁路和小洋铁路的经验，有了车子化、索道化、河运化的经验，有了装卸机械化和半机械化的经验，只要我们坚持贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，自力更生，洋土并举，因地制宜，就地取材，由低级到高级，不断地完善，不断地发展，厂内运输落后于生产发展的情况，必然会很快转变。北京光华木材厂是一个例子，天津全市厂矿迅速实现厂内运输机械化和半机械化也是一个例子。
    现在，技术革新和技术革命运动的矛头，正指向劳动最笨重、用人最多，对生产影响最大的落后环节。厂内运输正是这种落后环节之一。让我们乘着这个大好时机，生产运输一齐抓，让厂内运输来一个大革命！
