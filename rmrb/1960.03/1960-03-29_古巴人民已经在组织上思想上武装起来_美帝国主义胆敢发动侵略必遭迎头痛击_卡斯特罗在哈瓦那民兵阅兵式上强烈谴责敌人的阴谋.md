Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 27th: Fifty thousand militiamen held a grand parade and demonstration in Havana this afternoon. Cuban Prime Minister Castro sternly warned the aggressors who were waiting for an opportunity to invade Cuba at the parade, saying that the invaders would not only fight against the Cuban army, but also against the 50,000 militiamen who participated in the review today, and against all Cuban workers, farmers, and students. He said: The enemy should not expect us to fight only in the countryside and mountains. No, we will also fight in the cities. We will defend every street, every section, and every house. We will not give up an inch of land. If the enemies of Cuba attempt to invade Cuba, they will have to pay a high price. It would be better for them not to carry out such an invasion.

The militiamen participating in the review then raised their rifles and national flags and shouted: Swear to defend the motherland!

Prime Minister Castro, in referring to the "visits" of former dictator Batista's Army Chief of Staff Pedraza to Washington, New York, Miami, and the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and the military preparations being carried out in the United Fruit Company's territory in Honduras, said that the enemy is organizing and preparing for an attack; however, the Cuban people are also organizing and preparing for self-defense. They arm one mercenary, and we arm fifty revolutionaries.

Castro said, "It is not accidental that we are being attacked by North American capital. If the Cuban revolution had occurred in Saudi Arabia, it would be the same for North American monopoly capital. This is not just a matter of distance, nor is it just a geographical or political issue. This is a matter of economic exploitation."

Prime Minister Castro emphasized that standing behind the Cuban rebel army is the entire Cuban people, and standing behind the entire Cuban people are the people of all countries around the world who are prepared to fight to defend the Cuban revolution. He said: Wherever there are workers and peasants who have been liberated or are still oppressed, wherever there are exploited people, wherever there are honest men and women, there are armies determined to defend human dignity and human rights, and to defend the Cuban revolution.

Prime Minister Castro strongly condemned the foreign forces for instigating divisive propaganda in order to create an excuse to interfere in Cuba. He said that these foreign forces know that to invade Cuba, they will encounter much more difficulty than they did in Guatemala. Therefore, they are trying to deceive and divide the people, vainly attempting to provoke struggles within the people. But the people are very clear, and they have revolutionary consciousness. The Cuban people are not only well-armed organizationally, but also well-armed with revolutionary ideas. The people are strong because they are united. They have only one thought—the thought of the motherland; only one concept—the concept of revolution; only one flag—the Cuban flag.

The militiamen being reviewed then shouted in unison: Unity, unity, unity!

Cuban Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro pointed out in his speech that this grand militia demonstration is a warning to the aggressors. He said that the Cuban people have prepared everything, not to die, but to live, to win, and to defend the motherland. He said that not only the Cuban people, but also the people of Venezuela and Bolivia have begun to organize volunteer teams to defend the Cuban revolution. Because the people of Latin American countries know that defending the Cuban revolution is defending the revolution of Latin America, because the disasters they suffer are common. Raúl Castro cited an example to prove this point, saying that the "northern neighbor" of Latin America provided 47 million US dollars in "aid" to twenty Latin American republics in 1954, but only one American monopoly organization—Venezuelan Mobil Oil Company—announced that its profits seized in the same year reached 333 million US dollars. Raúl Castro also condemned Cuban reactionary commentator Conte Agüero, who carried out anti-communist propaganda, as a "traitorous separatist." At this time, male and female militiamen shouted in unison, "Kill Conte!"

This grand militia review was held at the Freedom City Air Force Airport. Worker, employee, student, and women militiamen, carrying rifles, marched with firm steps past the reviewing stand. Participating in the review were also peasant militiamen from the famous revolutionary base of the Sierra Maestra, wearing palm hats. The militiamen also carried out military exercises to capture enemy positions. (Attached picture)

    古巴人民已经在组织上思想上武装起来
    美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略必遭迎头痛击
    卡斯特罗在哈瓦那民兵阅兵式上强烈谴责敌人的阴谋
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　五万民兵今天下午在哈瓦那举行盛大的阅兵示威。古巴总理卡斯特罗在阅兵式上严正警告伺机侵犯古巴的侵略者说，侵略者不仅要同古巴军队作战，而且要同今天参加检阅的五万民兵作战，同古巴所有的工人、农民和学生作战。他说：敌人不要妄想我们仅仅在农村和山区作战。不，我们还要在城市里作战。我们将保卫每一条街道，每一个地段和每一所房屋。我们将一寸土地也不退让，古巴的敌人如果企图侵略古巴，他们就得付出高昂的代价。对他们说来，还是不进行这种侵略为妙。
    参加检阅的民兵们这时高举步枪和国旗高呼：誓死保卫祖国！
    卡斯特罗总理在谈到前独裁者巴蒂斯塔的陆军总监佩德拉萨在华盛顿、纽约、迈阿密和多米尼加、尼加拉瓜的“访问”以及在洪都拉斯美国联合果品公司的领地内进行的军事准备时说，敌人正在组织和准备进攻；但是，古巴人民也正在组织和准备自卫。他们武装起一个雇佣兵，我们就武装起五十个革命者。
    卡斯特罗说，“我们从北美大资本那里受到攻击，并不是偶然的。假如古巴革命发生在沙特阿拉伯，对北美大垄断资本来说，那将是同样的。这不光是个距离的问题，也不光是个地理问题或政治问题。这是一个经济剥削的问题。”
    卡斯特罗总理着重指出，站在古巴起义军背后的是古巴全国人民，站在古巴全国人民后面的是准备为保卫古巴革命而斗争的全世界各国人民。他说：凡是有已经获得解放或者还被压迫的工人和农民的地方，凡是有被剥削的人民的地方，凡是有正直的男子和妇女的地方，都有决心保卫人的尊严和人权、保卫古巴革命的军队。
    卡斯特罗总理强烈谴责外国势力为制造干涉古巴的借口而煽动分裂主义的宣传。他说，这些外国势力知道，要侵略古巴，他们遇到的问题将比在危地马拉遇到的困难得多。因此，他们企图蒙骗和分裂人民，妄想在人民内部挑起斗争。但是人民是清清楚楚的，他们具有革命的觉悟。古巴人民不仅在组织上武装得很好，而且在革命思想上也武装得很好。人民是强有力的，因为他们是团结的。他们只有一个思想——祖国的思想；只有一个观念——革命观念；只有一面旗帜——古巴国旗。
    受检阅的民兵这时一齐高呼：团结，团结，团结！
    古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗在讲话中指出，这次盛大的民兵示威是对侵略者的警告。他说，古巴人民已经准备好一切，不是准备好去死，而是准备好去活，去取得胜利，去保卫祖国。他说，不仅是古巴人民，委内瑞拉和玻利维亚两国的人民也开始组织保卫古巴革命的志愿队。因为拉丁美洲各国人民知道，保卫古巴革命就是保卫拉丁美洲的革命，因为他们受到的灾难是共同的。劳尔·卡斯特罗举例证明这个论断说，拉丁美洲“北部的邻居”1954年向拉丁美洲二十个共和国提供了四千七百万美元的“援助”，可是仅仅一个美国垄断组织——委内瑞拉美孚油公司宣布它在同一年攫取的利润就达三亿三千三百万美元。劳尔·卡斯特罗还谴责进行反共宣传的古巴反动评论员孔特·阿古埃罗是一个“卖国的分裂分子”。这时男女民兵一致高呼“打死孔特！”
    这次盛大的民兵检阅是在自由城的空军机场举行的。工人、雇员、学生和妇女民兵扛着步枪，迈着坚定的步伐从检阅台前走过。参加检阅的还有来自著名的革命根据地马埃斯特腊山的戴着棕榈帽的农民民兵。民兵们还进行了攻占敌人阵地的军事演习。（附图片）
