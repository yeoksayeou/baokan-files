How to Organize County and Commune Industries to Serve Agriculture
An Haitian, First Secretary of the Sui County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Since 1959, according to the Party's policy of promoting industry and agriculture simultaneously and local industries serving agriculture, we have continuously strengthened specific leadership over county and commune industries, giving full play to their role in supporting agriculture. From spring plowing, summer harvesting and planting, drought resistance to autumn harvesting and planting, and the winter water conservancy construction movement, we have continuously organized five major battles to support agriculture with industry, creating and modifying more than 700,000 various tools, greatly advancing agricultural technological transformation throughout the county.

Our main experiences in organizing industry to support agriculture over the past year are as follows:

I. County and commune industries should provide overall planning for agricultural support, fight battles in stages, seize the initiative every season, advance step by step, mobilize the masses, and tackle key problems together. Agricultural production has a strong seasonality, which also brings a "seasonality" to the production of local industries serving agriculture. In the past, our understanding of this was unclear, and local industries always grasped the manufacturing of agricultural tools on an ad-hoc basis. Although some efforts were made, they were always "following the horse's tail," fighting passive battles. In 1959, we resolutely changed this passive situation, providing topics for industry in advance based on the long-term plans and short-term arrangements of agricultural production, arranging production in advance, and turning from passive to active.

In this way, we were able to grasp the main contradictions in industrial support for agriculture, stay ahead of the season, and organize continuous battles with leadership, preparation, and steps, launching a massive mass movement. Last January, we focused on supporting spring plowing, targeting the most backward tools in spring sowing and field management, and focused on the "three implements" (i.e., reforming old-style hoes into dual-purpose weeding tools, reforming wheat and cotton loosening tools, and cotton seedling pot-making tools). The new tools increased work efficiency by one to forty times compared to the old tools. In March, we focused on supporting wheat harvesting, ensuring the full supply of general harvesting tools and focusing on the reform of wheat processing tools and rural canteen cooking utensils, greatly saving labor. In April, we focused on drainage and irrigation tools; in July, we focused on supporting drought resistance, concentrating on the repair and maintenance of power (pumping machines) and the reform of water lifting tools, ensuring that more than 150 of the county's 165 pumping machines operated day and night; and converting 800 manual foot-operated waterwheels into animal-powered waterwheels. In early August, we focused on supporting autumn harvesting and planting, concentrating on deep plows and seed drills, creating and improving a total of 40,000 various deep plows and close-planting seeding tools. In early September, we focused on supporting mountain and river management, rushing to produce nearly 80,000 carts, bringing the total number of carts to 150,000, basically achieving cart transportation and eliminating manual carrying of soil, fertilizer, and grain at all water conservancy construction sites and most rural areas. When organizing each battle, we prepared one or two months in advance, first with agriculture providing the topics, industrial departments going deep into the countryside to investigate and gather information, collecting raw materials, and conducting trial production and sample selection and finalization in advance according to the season and tools. Therefore, once a battle was launched, it quickly formed a magnificent mass movement.

Because we effectively organized continuous battles of industrial support for agriculture, the mass movement of agricultural technological transformation continued to develop, wave after wave, each wave higher than the last, with better and more tools, and the enthusiasm of the masses growing.

II. Organizing continuous battles and launching a mass movement to reform tools cannot be done with a disorganized army. We must focus on key points, establish red flags, create models, and gradually promote them from point to area. At the same time, innovation must be preceded by experimentation, production must be preceded by trial production, and technical training must be conducted after sample selection and finalization. This is to adhere to the mass line method of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Last winter and this spring, our county vigorously promoted cart transportation. Not long ago, the county held a cart parade, concentrating various carts to repair roads, inspect and compare them, test the quality and work efficiency of the carts, select samples, and repeatedly study and select them. Finally, three superior and high-quality cart types were determined: animal-drawn carts, dual-purpose human and animal-drawn carts, and human-drawn carts, with unified specifications. Currently, technology is being widely taught and promoted. This is fast, economical, and ensures quality, which the masses are very satisfied with. When manufacturing carts, all parts of the county organized cart transportation corps and cart transportation combat groups composed of 2,000 workers and 6,000 farmers. Workers made models and farmers imitated them; workers served as teachers and farmers as apprentices. This way, industry led agriculture and agriculture assisted industry, resulting in one worker turning into five workers, and the county's daily cart production increased from 1,000 to 2,500, with relatively good quality.

III. In order to enable local industries to better support agriculture, we must continuously expand county and commune industries and establish a four-level (county, commune, district, team) agricultural machinery repair and assembly network. How to expand and equip local industries? The main reliance is on self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and arming ourselves. In the past, some people believed that agricultural mechanization was all "foreign gadgets" and that the county and rural areas had no way to do it. At the end of 1958, the farm tool factories of all communes in the county had only a few baking ovens, and the management districts had no factories at all. After we proposed industrial support for agriculture and vigorously reformed tools at the beginning of 1959, we first criticized the erroneous ideas of fearing difficulties, "waiting for large and foreign," and reaching out for assistance from above among some cadres. The county party committee first established the red flags of the Lishan Commune and Wanhe Commune farm tool factories in developing commune-run industries through self-reliance, summarized their experiences, and promoted them throughout the county. For example, over the past year, the Lishan Commune has mobilized all factory workers to boldly innovate and reform and install more than 20 kinds of machine equipment such as thread rolling machines, milling machines, cylinder boring machines, woodworking planers, circular saws, band saws, and combined indigenous and foreign spring hammers, using waste machine parts and self-opened furnace casting methods, enabling many processes in the factory's casting, forging, machining, refining, and woodworking workshops to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization.

In addition to actively expanding and equipping itself to serve agricultural production, the county and commune industries in our county also adopt the practice of "the hen laying eggs" to vigorously help management districts and production teams establish and improve mechanical repair and assembly stations and groups, and continuously improve the technical level of agricultural machinery and farm tool repair and manufacturing. The factories, stations, and groups at all levels have both a certain division of labor and implement large-scale collaboration, supporting and promoting each other from top to bottom, making greater contributions to industrial support for agriculture and gradually promoting agricultural technological transformation.

    怎样组织县社工业为农业服务
    中共随县县委第一书记　安海田
    自1959年以来，我们根据党的工业与农业同时并举和地方工业为农业服务的方针，不断地加强了县、社工业的具体领导，充分发挥它们支援农业的作用，由春耕、夏收夏种、抗旱到秋收秋种和冬季的兴修水利运动，连续组织了工业支援农业的五大战役，创制和改制各种工具七十多万件，使全县农业技术改造获得很大成绩。
    我们一年来在组织工业支援农业的工作中，主要有以下三点体会：
    一、县、社工业支援农业要全面规划，分段作战，季季赶早，步步提前，发动群众，齐攻关键。农业生产有强烈的季节性，这也就给为农业服务的地方工业带来生产上的“季节性”。过去，我们对这点认识不明确，地方工业制造农具总是现用现抓，搞也搞了，老是放“马后炮”，打被动仗。1959年我们坚决改变了这种被动局面，根据农业生产的长计划短安排，为工业提前出题，提前安排，提前生产，由被动变主动。
    这样，就使我们在工业支援农业上能够抓住主要矛盾，走在季节前面，有领导有准备有步骤地连续组织战役，大搞群众运动。我们去年元月大抓支援春耕，针对春播和田间管理中最落后的工具，主攻了“三器”（即旧式锄改为两用锄草器，改革麦棉松土器、棉花制钵器），新制工具比旧式工具分别提高工效一倍至四十倍。3月大抓支援麦收，除了保证一般收割工具充分供应外，又主攻了小麦加工工具和农村食堂炊具的改革，大大节省了劳力。4月抓排灌工具，7月抓支援抗旱，主攻了动力（抽水机）修配和提水工具的改革，使全县一百六十五台抽水机经常保证一百五十台以上昼夜运转；把八百部人力脚踏水车改为畜力水车。8月上旬大抓支援秋收秋种，主攻了深耕犁和条播器，创造、改良的各种深耕犁和密植播种工具共达四万件。9月初大抓支援治山治水，赶制车子近八万部，连同原有的车子达十五万部，所有水利工地和大部分农村运土、运肥、运粮基本实现了车子化和基本消灭了人力肩挑。我们在组织每次战役的时候，都提前一两个月就进行准备，首先由农业出题目，工业部门深入农村调查摸底，筹集原材料，按季节按工具提前试制和选样定型，所以当一个战役铺开之后，很快就形成了波澜壮阔的群众运动。
    由于有效地组织了工业支援农业的连续性战役，就使农业技术改造的群众运动不断向前发展，一浪催一浪，一浪高一浪，工具越改越好越多，群众劲头越来越大。
    二、组织连续战役，大搞工具改革的群众运动，不能乱兵上阵，一定要搞好重点，树立红旗，做出样板，由点到面，逐步推广。同时，要革新还必须先试验，生产先试制，经过选样定型，并进行技术培训。这也就是坚持“多快好省”的群众路线方法。去冬今春我县大搞车子化，不久前全县曾举行了一次车子大检阅，把各种车子集中起来边修公路，边检查评比，检验车子的质量和工效，从中选样定型，反复研究挑选，最后确定了畜拉车、人畜两用车和人拉车三种优等优质的车型，统一规格。目前正在广泛传授技术，大加推广。这样既快且省，确保质量，群众很满意。制造车子时，全县各地组织了两千工人和六千农民的车子化兵团、车子化战斗组等，由工人做出样板，农民仿造；工人当师傅，农民当徒弟。这样以工带农，以农助工，结果原来一个工人变成了五个工人，全县每日造车子由一千部增加到二千五百部，质量也都比较好。
    三、为了使地方工业更好地支援农业，就得不断地扩大县、社工业，建立四级（县、社、区、队）农业机械修配网。如何扩大和装备地方工业？主要是靠自力更生，土洋并举，自己武装自己。过去有些人认为搞农业机械化都是些“洋玩艺”，县和农村没有办法。1958年底，全县各公社的农具厂仅有几盘烘炉，各管理区根本没有工厂。1959年初我们提出工业支援农业、大搞工具改革以后，首先在部分干部中批判了害怕困难，“望大待洋”，伸手向上要的错误思想。县委首先树立了历山公社和万和公社两个农具厂自力更生发展社办工业的红旗，总结他们的经验，全县推广。如历山公社一年来发动全厂职工，大胆革新，利用废机件和自己开炉铸造的办法，改革安装了过丝床、铣床、搪缸机、刨木床、圆盘锯、皮带锯以及土洋结合的弹簧锤等二十几种机器设备，使全厂的铸、锻、车、炼、木等车间，许多工序都实现了半机械化和机械化。
    我县县社工业除了为农业生产服务而积极扩大和装备自身以外，还采取母鸡下蛋的做法，大力帮助管理区和生产队建立健全机械修配站、组，不断提高农业机械和农具修配制造的技术水平。各级厂、站、组之间既有一定的分工，又要实行大协作，上下互相支援，互相促进，为工业继续支援农业、逐步促进农业技术改造作出更大的贡献。
