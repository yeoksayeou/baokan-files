Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th: The Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces issued a statement saying that American interventionists and the heads of their loyal lackey, the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," are currently intensifying their activities, continuing to undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, expanding the civil war, persecuting and massacring the people, implementing warlordism and dictatorial policies, and attempting to rapidly transform Laos into a new colony and war base of American imperialism.

The statement, published in the March 22nd issue of "Lao Patriotic News," was issued by the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces after a recent cadre meeting to study the current situation in Laos and the directives of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front. The statement expressed warm support for the correct propositions and line of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The statement pointed out that the Lao reactionaries, under the direction of American interventionists, are plotting conspiracies to seize a majority of seats in the National Assembly, in order to turn the new National Assembly into a tool to serve their traitorous and harmful policies. They act arbitrarily and illegally amended the Lao election law, making it the most reactionary election law. They continue to imprison Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, preventing them from freely participating in the general election. They also use American aid funds to buy votes and deceive, threaten, and force people to vote for them. At the same time, they continue to conduct "sweeps" in various places. Now, they have mobilized ten main battalions and thousands of "village guards" and bandits to begin large-scale "sweeps" in Lower Laos, in order to coordinate with the 10,000 troops of the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem group in "sweeps" along the Lao-South Vietnamese border.

The statement said that despite various obstacles, the Lao Patriotic Front is still making every effort to participate in the general election and has sent representatives to participate in the election. This proves that the Lao Patriotic Front always puts the interests of the motherland and the people above all else, and always hopes to peacefully resolve the country's existing problems on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces hopes that the Royal Government will recognize its responsibility to the people and to history, and avoid exacerbating the tense situation in Laos.

The statement, in referring to the atrocities of the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" continuing to dispatch troops to conduct "sweeps" and kill people, said that the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people's armed forces and fight resolutely to the end to defend their homes and protect the lives and property of the people, and will never allow the motherland to fall under the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys.

The statement concluded by saying that the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces believes that the Lao people, with their patriotic spirit and tradition of unyielding struggle, will surely be able to crush all the enemy's conspiracies and win a glorious victory.

    不让祖国陷于美国及其走狗统治之下
    老挝人民武装决心战斗到底
    寮国战斗部队第二营声明拥护爱国战线党中央的指示
    据新华社河内29日电　寮国战斗部队第二营发表声明说，美国干涉者和它的忠实走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们，目前仍在加紧活动，继续破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，扩大内战，迫害、残杀人民，实行军阀、独裁政策，企图使老挝迅速地变成美帝国主义的新的殖民地和战争基地。
    刊载在3月22日“老挝爱国新闻”上的这项声明，是寮国战斗部队第二营在最近举行的干部会议上研究了老挝当前局势和老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的指示以后发表的。声明对老挝爱国战线党正确的主张、路线表示热烈拥护。
    声明指出，老挝反动派在美国干涉者的指使下，正在策划阴谋，妄图霸占国民议会多数席位，以便把新的国民议会变成为他们叛国殃民的政策服务的工具。他们独断专行，非法地修改了老挝的选举法，使之成为最反动的选举法。他们继续监禁苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人，阻挠他们自由参加大选。他们还用美国的援助款项收买选民，并且欺骗、威胁和强迫人民投他们的票。同时，他们继续在各地进行“扫荡”。现在又调集十个主力营和成千名“乡卫队”、土匪等开始在下寮进行大规模的“扫荡”，以便配合南越吴庭艳集团的一万军队在老挝—南越边界沿线的“扫荡”。
    声明说，尽管受到种种阻挠，老挝爱国战线党仍然作出一切努力来参加大选，并且派出代表参加竞选。这证明了老挝爱国战线党时刻都把祖国和人民的利益置于一切之上，时刻都希望在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上和平解决国家存在的问题。寮国战斗部队第二营希望王国政府认清自己对人民、对历史所负的责任，避免加剧老挝的紧张局势。
    声明在谈到“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们继续派遣军队进行“扫荡”、杀害人民的暴行时说，寮国战斗部队第二营将同人民的武装力量并肩一起，坚决战斗到底，以保卫家乡，保护人民的生命财产，决不让祖国陷于美帝国主义及其走狗统治之下。
    声明最后说，寮国战斗部队第二营相信，具有爱国主义精神和不屈斗争传统的老挝人民，一定能够粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，获得光荣的胜利。
