    Prevention First, Control Pig Diseases
    Sichuan Launches Spring "Four Diseases, Three Injections" Disease Prevention Campaign
    Dayao County, Yunnan Improves Feeding Management, Spring Pig Epidemics Greatly Reduced
    (Our Newspaper) News: Sichuan is implementing the principle of "prevention first," taking early action, and extensively launching the "Four Diseases, Three Injections" campaign to prevent spring pig epidemics.
    "Four Diseases, Three Injections" was proposed by Sichuan Province based on the historical patterns of pig diseases and the need to strengthen disease prevention in collectively raised pigs. "Four Diseases" refers to the four major pig diseases with a wide prevalence and significant harm in the province: swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine pneumonia, and piglet paratyphoid; "Three Injections" refers to an average of three preventive injections per pig.
    To ensure the realization of this year's leap forward plan for increasing the number of pigs in the province by 50% compared to last year, and striving to double it, all localities attach great importance to pig disease prevention and control work, and deployed this work as early as January. From the special districts and counties to the communes and management areas, organizations have been established at all levels to strengthen the specific leadership of the "Four Diseases, Three Injections" disease prevention campaign, and mobilize the masses to vigorously launch a campaign. Wusheng County adopted the methods of early treatment, universal treatment, and continuous treatment. The county organized more than 230 veterinarians and more than 2,200 animal epidemic prevention personnel to implement contract responsibility by area, taking medicine to the countryside, and cooperating with more than 15,000 breeders in the county to comprehensively carry out emergency injections. In just ten days, swine fever vaccine was universally injected into more than 300,000 pigs in the county, and swine pneumonia vaccine was injected into some pigs. During the "Four Diseases, Three Injections" campaign launched in Wanxian Special District from February 2nd to 10th, more than 80% of the pigs in the district received preventive injections. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of February, more than one million pigs in the province had been injected with preventive vaccines.
    To ensure the medicines needed for the "Four Diseases, Three Injections" disease prevention campaign, all localities, following the principle of "mainly indigenous, combining indigenous and foreign methods," mobilized the masses to produce indigenous veterinary drugs on a large scale. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300 swine fever rabbit-adapted vaccine manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, producing more than 35 million milliliters of vaccine.
    While vigorously injecting preventive vaccines into pigs, all localities have universally strengthened pig feeding management and sanitation to improve the pigs' disease resistance.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Telegram: Dayao County, Yunnan Province, is implementing the principle of improving feeding management as the main approach and drug prevention and control as a supplementary approach. The incidence of spring pig epidemics has decreased from 20% in the same period last year to 1%. The number of live pigs in the county has increased from more than 215,000 at the beginning of January to more than 240,000. One commune, nineteen management areas, and three hundred and fifty-two production teams have reached the level of one pig per person; nine management areas and one hundred and twenty-five production teams have achieved one pig per mu of land.
    The Dayao County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that with the great development of the pig raising industry, the past small-scale pig raising experience of "no skill is needed in raising pigs, just keep the sty dry and feed them well" can no longer adapt. It is necessary to summarize a set of epidemic prevention and hygiene work experience suitable for large-scale collective pig raising in a timely manner. Therefore, from the county party secretary to the leading cadres at all levels of the commune, management area, and production team, and the animal husbandry cadres, all went deep into the pig farms, together with veterinarians and breeders, to establish "experimental plots" for pig raising and epidemic prevention. Based on the experience of the "experimental plots" at all levels, the county party committee summarized that epidemic prevention work in collective pig raising should implement the principle of improving feeding management as the main approach and drug prevention and control as a supplementary approach. The county first solved the problem of pigsties. There are many hilly areas in the county, and cave pig farms can be built by digging caves in the mountains (caves are warm in winter and cool in summer). In just over a month, the county dug 22,335 caves and repaired and newly built more than 10,000 pigsties. Each pig farm feeds pigs in separate sties according to boars, sows, fattening pigs, lean pigs, sick pigs, and pigs of different sizes and strengths, avoiding the spread of epidemics and mutual biting, so that the pigs can sleep well and eat well. The pigsties are disinfected regularly, the walls are whitewashed with lime, the sties are smoked with fire, and they are padded and cleaned frequently. Grazing is carried out regularly every day, so that the pigs are healthy, and have strong disease resistance. Sick pigs are strictly isolated.
    At present, Dayao County has established a veterinary hospital, communes have established veterinary stations, management areas have established veterinary teams, and pig farms and production teams have one or two veterinarians.

    以防为主  防治猪病
    四川开展春季“四病三针”防疫运动
    云南大姚县改善饲养管理春季猪疫大大减少
    本报讯　四川各地贯彻执行“预防为主”的方针，及早动手，广泛开展防治春季猪疫的“四病三针”运动。
    “四病三针”是四川省根据历年猪只发病规律和集体饲养猪只必须加强防疫工作的特点提出来的。“四病”是指全省流行面较广、危害性较大的四种主要猪病：猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和仔猪副伤寒；“三针”是指平均每头猪预防注射三针。
    为了保证实现今年全省养猪头数比去年增加50％，力争翻一番的跃进计划，各地特别重视猪病防治工作，早在1月份就部署了这一工作。从专区、县直到公社和管理区，都层层建立了机构，加强了“四病三针”防疫运动的具体领导，并发动群众，大力开展突击。武胜县采取早期治、普遍治、连续治的方法，全县组织了二百三十多名兽医和二千二百多个牲畜防疫员，实行分片包干，带药下乡，配合全县一万五千多名饲养员全面开展突击注射，仅十天时间就给全县三十多万头猪只普遍注射了猪瘟预防针，部分猪只注射了猪肺疫预防针。万县专区在2月2日到10日开展“四病三针”突击运动中，全区80％以上的猪只进行了防疫注射。据不完全统计，到2月下旬，全省注射防疫针的猪只已达一百多万头。
    为了保证“四病三针”防疫运动中所需的药物，各地按“以土为主，土洋结合”的原则，发动群众大造土兽药。据不完全统计，全省兴办猪瘟兔化疫苗制造厂三百多个，生产疫苗三千五百多万毫升。
    在大力注射猪只预防针药的同时，各地普遍加强了猪只饲养管理和清洁卫生工作，以提高猪只抗病能力。
    据新华社昆明电　云南省大姚县贯彻以改善饲养管理为主、药物防治为辅的方针，春季猪疫发病率已由去年同期的20％下降到1％。全县生猪已由1月初的二十一万五千多头繁殖到二十四万多头；有一个公社、十九个管理区、三百五十二个生产队已达到一人一头猪；有九个管理区、一百二十五个生产队已实现一亩地一头猪。
    中共大姚县委认为，随着养猪事业的大发展，过去所谓“养猪不用巧，厩干食饱”的小规模养猪经验已经不能适应，必须及时总结一套适合大规模集体养猪的防疫卫生工作经验。因此，从县委书记到公社、管理区、生产队的各级领导干部和畜牧业干部，都深入到猪场，同兽医、饲养员一起建立养猪防疫“试验田”。县委根据各级“试验田”的经验，总结出集体养猪的防疫工作应当贯彻以改善饲养管理为主、药物防治为辅的方针。全县首先解决了厩舍问题。县内丘陵地多，可以就山挖窑洞建猪场（窑洞冬暖夏凉）。全县一个多月就挖窑洞二万二千三百三十五个，并修补、新盖厩舍一万多间。各猪场按公猪、母猪、肥猪、瘦猪、病猪以及大小强弱等分厩喂养，避免了疫病流行和互相咬伤，让猪睡好吃好。厩舍定期消毒，用石灰粉刷墙壁，用火烟熏厩，勤垫勤起。每日定时放牧，使猪只身体健壮，抗病力强。有病猪就严格隔离。
    目前，大姚县建立了兽医院，公社都建立了兽医站，管理区成立兽医组，养猪场和生产队都有一两个兽医员。
