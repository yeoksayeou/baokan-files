    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 6th: The movement initiated by the Rebel Army television station to donate double the amount of money previously donated to purchase airplanes and weapons, in the wake of the "La Coubre" ship explosion, has become a new symbol of the Cuban public's opposition to the United States' inhuman policy of collective massacre of the Cuban people and its barbaric interventionism. From morning till night, the Cuban people, including the elderly, children, and the disabled, stand in long lines to donate to the television station and speak out against the crimes of U.S. imperialism.

    A black worker said that the explosion did not kill communists, nor did it kill Catholics, but it killed Cubans. Our strength lies in unity.

    An excited young militiaman said that I am a supporter of peace, but in order to defend our motherland, we must buy weapons. They are a large and powerful country, and we are a small country, but we have a noble spirit. A small businessman said angrily and humorously that we must buy weapons and take up arms to make the Americans angry!

    An unemployed old man, trembling as he put a peso into the donation box, said that although I am unemployed, I want to do everything I can to defend the motherland. I believe that the revolution will give me work soon.

    A child, handing over five cents he had saved for snacks, said, "My name is Roberto, I am eight years old, and I am strong enough to take up arms to defend the revolution and the children. We do not want to grow up to be slaves of the United States." An office worker suggested on television that people without money should donate scrap steel and iron. Then an old lady brought in scrap iron.

    A well-dressed bank clerk said that if the United States calls everything patriotic communism, then I am a communist, although I am now a devout Catholic.

    People from all walks of life participated in the donation movement, including upright expatriates and foreign tourists in Cuba. A Spanish woman said that I am as indignant as the Cubans about this inhumane crime and excited about the achievements made in Cuba.

    Three American small businessmen from Florida also donated two dollars each. They said, "We are very happy to be able to support the Cuban revolution, and when we return to the United States, we will tell our neighbors the truth about Cuba."

    Many Cubans voluntarily took out the dollars they had saved, without keeping a penny. They said, "We don't want to keep dollars at home." Every corner of Havana, the streets, buses, cafes, cinemas, and homes are shrouded in an atmosphere of indignation. The United States, due to its shameless interference and criminal sabotage, has completely lost its prestige among the people of its nearest neighbor, Cuba.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: According to a report from Havana by Prensa Latina on March 7th, the arms explosion on the "La Coubre" ship on the 4th caused nearly 15 million pesos in damages (one peso equals one dollar). The "National Daily" said that the docks and shops in the Pan American port were completely destroyed by the explosion, and many buildings in the surrounding area were also seriously damaged.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: The National Women's Federation today sent a telegram to the Cuban Revolutionary Women's League, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialist-instigated counter-revolutionary elements for the crime of creating an arms explosion in Havana Harbor, and extending sincere condolences to the families of the victims and the injured in this incident.

    The telegram said: "Chinese women strongly protest the U.S. imperialists' barbaric crimes of attempting to strangle the Cuban revolution and harm the Cuban people, and firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people and women. We firmly believe that the U.S. imperialists' aggressive conspiracy will be shamefully defeated by the heroic resistance of the Cuban people and women. All justice-upholding and peace-loving people and women around the world stand with you. Your struggle to defend the fruits of revolutionary victory and safeguard national independence will surely achieve final victory."

    Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Cuban Socialist Youth League, the Cuban University Students' Federation, and the July 26th Movement Student Department, protesting the crime of U.S. imperialism in manufacturing the "La Coubre" ship explosion incident, and expressing condolences and sympathy to the victims and injured in this incident.

    The telegram said: "Today, the Cuban people and youth and students, in the face of the U.S. imperialists' barbaric atrocities and frenzied threats, have united more strongly and are determined to defend their revolution and vow not to retreat. Such people are invincible. The logic of U.S. imperialism is to make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until its demise. Victory will not belong to U.S. imperialism, but to the revolutionary Cuban people. Chinese youth and students resolutely stand with you and fight together to the end against U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that your just struggle will surely achieve victory."

    誓以实际行动来反击美国侵略者的破坏活动
    古巴全国掀起捐献武器热潮
    我妇联、青联、学联抗议美国制造军火爆炸事件的罪行
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件中的一个死难者的家属在起义军电视台发起的比过去捐献加倍的钱来购买飞机、武器的运动，已经变成古巴公众反对美国惨无人道地集体屠杀古巴人民的野蛮干涉主义政策的新的标志。从清晨到深夜，古巴人民，包括老人、儿童和残废的人，排着长长的行列来到电视台进行捐献，并且发言抗议美帝国主义的罪行。
    一位黑人工人说，爆炸不是杀害了共产党员，也不是杀害了天主教徒，而是杀害了古巴人。我们的力量在于团结。
    一位青年民兵激动地说，我是和平拥护者，但是为了保卫祖国，我们一定要购买武器。他们是个大的强国，我们是一个小国，但是我们具有崇高的气节。一个小商人激愤而诙谐地说，我们一定要购买武器和拿起武器，让美国佬发怒吧！
    用颤抖的手把一个比索投入捐献箱的一位失业老人说，虽然我是一个失业者，但是我也想尽我的一切可能来保卫祖国。我相信不久以后革命会给我工作。
    一个孩子在交出买点心的五分钱时说，我叫罗伯托，今年八岁，我有力气拿起武器来保卫革命和儿童，我们不想长大起来做美国的奴隶。一位职员在电视中提议没有钱的人捐献废钢废铁。接着一位老太太就拿来了废铁。
    一个穿得很讲究的银行职员说，假如美国把具有爱国精神的一切都说成是共产主义的，那末我就是共产主义者，虽然我现在是一个虔诚的天主教徒。
    参加捐献运动的有社会各阶层人物，包括正直的侨民和在古巴的外国旅客。一位西班牙妇女说，我像古巴人一样为这种惨无人道的罪行感到愤慨，并为在古巴所取得的成就而感到兴奋。
    三个佛罗里达州的美国小商人也每人捐出二块美元。他们说，我们很高兴能够支持古巴革命，当我们回美国时，我们将把古巴的真实情况告诉我们的邻居。
    很多古巴人自愿地拿出他们存有的美元，一分钱也不留。他们说，我们不想把美元留在家里。哈瓦那的每一个角落，大街上、公共汽车里、咖啡馆、电影院和家里都笼罩着愤慨的气氛。美国由于它的无耻干涉和罪恶破坏已在离它最近的邻国古巴人民中完全丧失威信了。
    新华社7日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社7日自哈瓦那报道，4日发生的“勒库布尔号”轮船军火爆炸事件造成了近一千五百万比索（一比索等于一美元）的损失。“国民日报”说，泛美港口的码头和商店由于爆炸而全部毁坏了，附近地区的很多建筑物也因为这次爆炸受到严重损害。
    新华社7日讯　全国妇女联合会今天致电古巴革命妇女联盟，强烈抗议美帝国主义指使反革命分子在哈瓦那港制造军火爆炸事件的暴行，并向这次事件中的死难者的家属和受伤者致以深切的慰问。
    电报说：“中国妇女强烈抗议美帝国主义企图扼杀古巴革命、残害古巴人民的野蛮暴行，并坚决支持古巴人民和妇女的正义斗争。我们坚信，美帝国主义的侵略阴谋在古巴人民和妇女的英勇抗击下必将遭到可耻的失败。全世界一切主持正义和爱好和平的人民和妇女，是和你们站在一起的。你们保卫革命胜利果实、维护民族独立的斗争，一定能够获得最后的胜利。”
    新华社7日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会，今天致电古巴社会主义青年联盟、古巴大学生联合会和7月26日运动学生部，抗议美帝国主义制造“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件的罪行，并向这次事件中的死难者和受伤者表示哀悼和慰问。
    电报说：“今天，古巴人民和青年学生在美帝国主义的野蛮的暴行和疯狂的威胁面前，更加坚强地团结了起来，决心保卫自己的革命，誓不后退。这样的人民是不可战胜的。美帝国主义的逻辑是捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡。胜利的将不是美帝国主义，而是革命的古巴人民。中国青年和学生坚决和你们站在一边，为反对美帝国主义而共同斗争到底。我们坚信你们的正义斗争一定取得胜利。”
