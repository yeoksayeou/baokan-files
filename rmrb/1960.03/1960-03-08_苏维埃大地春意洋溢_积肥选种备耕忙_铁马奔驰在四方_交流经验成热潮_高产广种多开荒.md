Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th: The first spring of the sixties has arrived on the vast Soviet land, and work to strive for a new harvest has been widely launched in the Soviet fields. Although areas such as Siberia are still experiencing biting cold winds and snow-covered ground, everywhere presents a busy scene of accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, selecting seeds, and overhauling agricultural tools; while in Kuban, Ordzhonikidze, and other places in the southern part of the Russian Federation, and in various parts of the Armenian Republic, the sun is warm, the spring water is full, and thousands of tractors are galloping across the fields.

From the plans formulated by various regions, it can be seen that applying more soil and manure, learning advanced experience, rationally utilizing land, adjusting the planting area structure, and planting more high-yield crops are new features and new atmospheres in this year's agricultural production.

This year, the fertilizer accumulation work in various regions is better than in previous years. As early as the end of last year, the soil and manure accumulated in various regions reached more than 370 million tons, an increase of more than 70 million tons compared with 1958. Agricultural workers in Ukraine, Turkmenistan, Latvia, Georgia and other republics, and state farms in Belarus have completed the fertilizer accumulation tasks ahead of schedule. The amount of local fertilizer transported to the fields in the Russian Federation is much larger than in previous years. Belarus will apply 60 million tons of organic fertilizer this year, of which at least 40 tons will be applied per hectare of corn and sugar beet. At the same time, lime is being applied to acidic land in large quantities. Agricultural workers in Stalin Oblast transported more than 600,000 tons of manure in January alone, which is equal to the total amount transported by the entire oblast in 1953.

The mechanical repair work is also progressing well. For example, various republics such as Ukraine have already overhauled various machines. The Russian Federation has issued special instructions for this purpose. Many states have also decided to sow within the best time and strive to shorten the sowing period. How to tap potential and learn advanced experience to improve production has become the focus of attention in various regions. The activity of learning from the advanced experience of Konstantinovka District in Stalin Oblast, Ukraine, has become a hot trend. This district decided to harvest 200 poods of grain per hectare in the next two to three years. According to the republic's call, Stalin Oblast held special lectures. The secretary of the state party committee, the chairman of the state Soviet, the chairmen of various collective farms, the directors of state farms, and agronomists all participated in the lectures to jointly study the advanced experience of this district. In addition, training courses for studying various advanced experiences have been held in various regions, and 4,000 people are studying. Many graduates of ten-year secondary schools are learning various machine operating methods and studying the advanced experience of innovators. This year, all parts of the Soviet Union are paying special attention to taking measures to expand the planting area and plant more high-yield crops—corn—and reduce the planting area of low-yield crops. Kazakhstan, one of the largest granaries in the Soviet Union, decided to strive to harvest 24.5 million tons of grain this year. To this end, the republic will reduce the planting area of oats and autumn-sown rye, and at the same time plant 2.1 million hectares more corn than last year, which can increase the republic's grain by 2 million tons and feed by 40%. The corn planting area in the Ukrainian Republic this year will be more than 2 million hectares more than last year. The corn planting area in Belarus and Estonia will be about twice as much as last year. This year, the Uzbek Republic has utilized the land that was not well utilized in the past, thus expanding the planting area by 65,000 hectares. In addition, Altai, Krasnoyarsk Territory, and Bryansk, Tyumen and other states will continue to reclaim some wasteland to increase this year's grain output.

    苏维埃大地春意洋溢
    积肥选种备耕忙  铁马奔驰在四方
    交流经验成热潮  高产广种多开荒
    新华社莫斯科7日电　六十年代的第一个春天，已经来到辽阔的苏维埃大地，争取新的丰收的工作已经在苏联田野上广泛展开。虽然西伯利亚等地区还是寒风刺骨、冰雪封地，但到处都呈现着积肥、运肥、选种、检修农具等一片繁忙的备耕景象；而在俄罗斯联邦南部的库班、奥尔忠尼启则等地和亚美尼亚共和国各地，阳光和煦，春水盈盈，田野上千百台拖拉机在纵横奔驰。
    从各地制订出的计划中可以看出，多施土肥和粪肥、学习先进经验、合理地利用土地、调整播种面积结构多种高产作物，是今年开始农业生产中的新特点、新气象。
    今年，各地的积肥工作做得比往年好。还在去年年底，各地积的土肥和粪肥就达三亿七千多万吨。比1958年增加了七千多万吨。乌克兰、土库曼、拉脱维亚，格鲁吉亚等共和国的农业劳动者和白俄罗斯国营农场都提前完成了积肥任务，俄罗斯联邦往地里运送的地方肥料大大多于往年。白俄罗斯今年要施用有机肥料六千万吨，其中玉蜀黍和甜菜每公顷土地至少施用四十吨。同时，正在大量向酸性地施用石灰。斯大林州的农业劳动者仅在1月份就运送了六十多万吨厩肥，这等于1953年全州全年运送的数量。
    机械检修工作进行得也很好。如乌克兰等共和国早已检修好各种机械。俄罗斯联邦为此特别发了指示。许多州还都决定在最好的时间内播种，并力争缩短播种期限。如何挖掘潜力、学习先进经验以提高产量，已成为各地注意的中心。乌克兰斯大林州学习康斯坦丁诺夫卡区先进经验的活动已经形成热潮。这个区决定在最近二至三年内每公顷收获二百普特谷物。根据共和国的号召，斯大林州举办了专门的讲座。州委书记、州苏维埃主席、各集体农庄主席、国营农场场长、农艺师都参加讲座，共同研究这个区的先进经验。此外，各地已经举办了研究各种先进经验的训练班，有四千人在学习。许多十年制中学毕业生在学习各种机器操纵法，研究革新者们的先进经验。全苏各地今年特别注意采取措施，来扩大播种面积，并多种高产作物——玉蜀黍，减少低产作物的播种面积。苏联最大谷仓之一哈萨克共和国决定在今年争取收获二千四百五十万吨谷物。为此，共和国将减少燕麦、秋播黑麦的播种面积，同时比去年多种二百一十万公顷玉蜀黍，这能为共和国增加二百万吨谷物和40％的饲料。乌克兰共和国今年的玉蜀黍播种面积要比去年多二百多万公顷。白俄罗斯和爱沙尼亚共和国的玉蜀黍播种面积将比去年多一倍左右。乌兹别克共和国今年把过去利用不好的土地都利用起来，因而可扩大播种面积六万五千公顷。此外，阿尔泰、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区和布利安斯克、丘门等州还要继续开垦部分荒地，以增加今年的谷物产量。
