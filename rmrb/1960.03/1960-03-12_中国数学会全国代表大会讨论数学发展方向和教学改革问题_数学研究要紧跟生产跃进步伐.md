Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 11th: The Chinese Mathematical Society recently held its Second National Congress in Shanghai, focusing on discussing two major issues in mathematical work: the direction of mathematical development and the reform of mathematics teaching. A total of one hundred and twenty-eight mathematics scientists and mathematics teacher representatives from all over the country attended the conference, and representatives from the Ministry of Education and other relevant departments also attended.

This conference was convened under the following circumstances: On the one hand, in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, after the national mathematics community criticized the academic view that theory was divorced from practice in past mathematics research work, the majority of mathematics workers devoted themselves to research in the socialist construction cause and achieved fruitful results, bringing mathematics work into a new stage. On the other hand, due to the rapid development of China's socialist construction, modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture all require advanced mathematics; the development of modern natural sciences, especially cutting-edge science and technology, requires higher mathematical theoretical tools; practical work has raised more and more complex mathematical theoretical problems, and the objective situation requires mathematical science to develop at a higher speed and higher quality. Therefore, this conference, on the basis of summarizing the experience of mathematics research work since the Great Leap Forward, continued to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, looked forward to the 1960s, and put forward opinions on the future direction of mathematical development and mathematics teaching reform, so that mathematics research work and teaching work can meet the needs of socialist construction.

During the meeting, Hua Luogeng, Chairman of the Mathematical Society, made a work report on the past eight years of the Chinese Mathematical Society, Guan Zhaozhi of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences made a speech on the direction of mathematical development, and Ding Ersheng, a representative of the Mathematics Department of Beijing Normal University, made a speech on suggestions for modernizing the content of mathematics textbooks for primary and secondary schools.

After ten days of enthusiastic and serious discussions, the representatives unanimously agreed that the Party's principle of combining theory with practice and of serving proletarian politics, socialist construction, and communist construction is also the only correct path for the future development of mathematics and the guiding principle for mathematics research work. Since mathematics is closely related to natural sciences, engineering technology, national economy and other aspects, combining the tasks of these aspects to develop mathematics should be a major direction in the future. Specifically, it is necessary to take the research of mathematical problems in five aspects, namely cutting-edge technology and major projects, modern physics, automation, national economy, and large-scale calculation tasks, as the key to drive the development of the entire mathematical science in the future. For example, differential equations are closely related to engineering technology and high-speed flight sounding technology, information theory is closely related to electronics, automatic control is closely related to electronic computers, functional analysis is closely related to modern physics, and probability theory, mathematical statistics, and programming mathematics are closely related to the national economy. Necessary attention and development should also be given to some mathematical branches that cannot be linked to these tasks for the time being.

Regarding the reform of mathematics teaching, which is related to the fundamental issue of how the country can train construction talents more, faster, better, and more economically, the conference had a very enthusiastic discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that the current mathematics textbook system in primary and secondary schools in China was basically formed before the 16th and 17th centuries, and the content is very outdated, far from meeting the needs of modern production and the development of cutting-edge science and technology for mathematical knowledge. According to this teaching system, a middle school student who has studied mathematics for twelve years has not learned the mathematical tools that have been widely used in modern production, cutting-edge science and technology, and the national economy, such as analytic geometry, calculus, differential equations, probability theory, mathematical statistics, and mathematical logic; for the calculation tools and calculation methods commonly used in modern production, such as approximate calculation, calculation tables, and slide rules, only very little introduction is made; and there is no mention of computers at all. In the current mathematics textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the interconnected contents of various subjects, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, are artificially separated and taught separately in each subject, which are not related to each other and are also unfavorable to the cultivation of students. Therefore, everyone believes that the reform of mathematics teaching has reached the point where it is ripe for success and imperative.

All the representatives held a full discussion on the modernization plan of mathematics textbook content for primary and secondary schools proposed by the Mathematics Department of Beijing Normal University. They unanimously agreed that this plan breaks the old system and is full of the revolutionary spirit of bold creation, and the direction is correct; however, the following points should also be paid attention to in the reform: (1) The current mathematics textbook content for primary and secondary schools is poor, outdated, isolated, fragmented, cumbersome, repetitive, and lags behind the actual situation of socialist construction. It is necessary to thoroughly reform the curriculum setting, textbook content, that is, the entire mathematics education system for primary and secondary schools, break the old system, especially the Euclidean geometry system, and re-establish a system that meets the needs of socialist construction; (2) The new mathematics education system for primary and secondary schools must serve socialism, especially modern production and cutting-edge science and technology. Therefore, middle schools must teach some modern mathematical knowledge, such as analytic geometry, mathematical analysis, probability theory and mathematical statistics, strengthen the cultivation of students' calculation ability and the use of calculation tools; (3) The new mathematics textbooks for primary and secondary schools must have a rigorous theoretical system, which should reflect the spirit of combining theory with practice, try to combine numbers and shapes, combine concepts and calculations, eliminate artificial restrictions on flexible and powerful tools and appropriate calculation methods, and highlight the position of mathematical analysis, a modern branch of mathematics; (4) The weight and difficulty of the new mathematics textbooks for primary and secondary schools should be in line with the students' learning level and the objective process of cognitive development. Concepts should be introduced from reality as much as possible, from concrete to abstract, from shallow to deep, and attention should be paid to preparing for the ability to accept more difficult concepts as early as possible through training. Based on the above requirements, everyone put forward several supplementary revision plans on the basis of the BNU plan, which will be submitted to relevant departments for research.

Finally, the conference re-elected the Council of the Chinese Mathematical Society, electing a new council of thirty-nine members, with Hua Luogeng as the chairman of the council.

    中国数学会全国代表大会讨论数学发展方向和教学改革问题
    数学研究要紧跟生产跃进步伐
    进行教育体系大革命为现代化生产和尖端科学技术服务
    新华社上海11日电　中国数学会最近在上海举行第二次全国代表大会，集中讨论了数学工作中的两个重大问题，即数学发展方向问题和数学教学改革问题。出席大会的，有来自全国各地的数学科学工作者和数学教师代表共一百二十八人，教育部等有关部门也派代表列席。
    这次大会是在这样的形势下召开的：一方面，在1958年工农业生产大跃进中，全国数学界批判了过去数学研究工作中存在的理论脱离实际的学术观点以后，广大数学工作者投身到社会主义建设事业中进行研究，获得了丰硕的成果，使数学工作进入了一个新的阶段。另一方面，由于我国社会主义建设事业飞跃发展，现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化到处需要高等数学；近代自然科学，特别是尖端科学技术的发展，需要更高的数学理论工具；实际工作中提出了愈来愈多、愈来愈复杂的数学理论问题，客观形势要求数学科学更加高速度、高质量地向前发展。因此，这次大会在总结大跃进以来数学研究工作经验的基础上，继续高举毛泽东思想红旗，展望六十年代，提出了今后的数学发展方向和数学教学改革的意见，使数学研究工作和教学工作适应社会主义建设事业的需要。
    会议期间，数学会理事长华罗庚作了中国数学会八年来的工作报告，中国科学院数学研究所关肇直作了关于数学发展方向问题的发言，北京师范大学数学系代表丁尔升作了关于中小学数学教材内容现代化建议的发言。
    代表们经过十天热烈的认真的讨论，一致认为，党的理论与实际相结合，科学工作为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设，为共产主义建设服务的方针，同样是今后数学发展的唯一正确的道路，也是数学研究工作的方针。由于数学与自然科学、工程技术和国民经济等各方面有密切的联系，因此结合这些方面的任务发展数学，应当是今后的一个主要方向。具体说来，就是要以研究尖端技术和重大工程、现代物理、自动化、国民经济、大量计算任务等五个方面的数学问题为纲，以此来带动今后整个数学科学的发展。如微分方程与工程技术、高速飞行探空技术，信息论与电子学，自动控制与电子计算机，泛涵分析与现代物理学，概率论数理统计、规划数学与国民经济等等，都有着非常密切的关系。对于某些一时还不能联系上这些任务的数学分支，也应给以必要的重视和发展。
    关于数学教学改革，关系到国家如何多快好省地培养建设人材的根本问题，大会讨论非常热烈。大家一致认为，目前我国中小学数学教材体系基本上还是十六、十七世纪以前形成的，内容十分陈旧，远远满足不了现代化生产及尖端科学技术发展对数学知识的需要。按照这个教学体系，一个中学生学了十二年数学，还根本学不到现代化生产、尖端科学技术和国民经济中已经广泛使用了的数学工具，如解析几何、微积分、微分方程、概率论、数理统计、数理逻辑等；对于现代化生产中常用的计算工具和计算方法，如近拟计算、计算用表、计算尺等，只作了极少的介绍；关于计算机，则只字未提。现行的中小学数学教材中，还把互相联系的各科内容，如算术、代数、几何、三角等，人为地割裂开来，分散在各科讲授，彼此不相关联，也对培养学生不利。因此大家认为，数学教学改革已经到了瓜熟蒂落、势在必行的地步。
    全体代表围绕北京师范大学数学系提出的中小学数学教材内容现代化方案，进行了充分的讨论。他们一致认为，这个方案打破了旧的系统，富有大胆创造的革命精神，方向是正确的；但改革中还应注意以下几点要求：（1）现行中小学数学教材内容贫乏、陈旧、孤立、割裂、繁琐、重复、落后于社会主义建设实际，必须对课程设置、教材内容，即整个中小学数学教育体系进行彻底革命，打破旧系统，特别是欧几里德几何体系，重新建立符合社会主义建设需要的体系；（2）新的中小学数学教育体系必须为社会主义服务，特别是为现代化生产和尖端科学技术服务。因此，中学校必须讲授某些现代化数学知识，和解析几何、数学分析、概率论与数理统计等，加强对学生计算能力的培养及计算工具的使用；（3）新的中小学数学教材必须有严谨的理论体系，这个体系应体现理论联系实际的精神，尽量作到数与形的结合，概念与计算的结合，消除人为的对灵活有力工具与恰当运算方法的限制，并突出数学分析这一近代数学分支的地位；（4）新的中小学数学教材的分量和难易程度，应符合学生的学习水平和认识力发展的客观过程，概念尽量从实际引入，由具体到抽象，由浅入深，并注意通过培养训练，及早为接受较难概念的能力作好准备。根据以上要求，大家在北师大方案的基础上，提出了几个补充修正方案，准备交给有关部门研究。
    最后，大会改选了中国数学会理事会，选出新的理事共三十九人，华罗庚为理事会理事长。
