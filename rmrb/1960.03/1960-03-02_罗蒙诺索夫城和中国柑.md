    Lomonosov City near Leningrad was originally called "Oranienbaum" during the time of the Russian Tsars. And "Oranienbaum" was attached to a citrus orchard with greenhouses belonging to the capital city of Petersburg. "Oranienbaum" is a foreign word, derived from the French word "orange." Russians call tangerines "Apelsin," which is a combination of two foreign words, "Apel" and "Sina." "Apel" means "apple"; "Sina" means "China," which means Russians call tangerines "Chinese apples."
    Tangerines were transmitted from China to India, and then from India to ancient Rome. Roman gardeners once covered unripe tangerines with clay or plaster molds to make the ripe tangerines into the shape of cups, bowls and other utensils. Later, the French found tangerine seeds and cultivated Chinese tangerines on French soil. In the twelfth century, the Russians imported Chinese tangerine seedlings from France and planted them in wooden barrels and raised them in greenhouses. Since then, Chinese tangerines have passed on their descendants on Russian soil. (Compiled by Wen Hong)

    罗蒙诺索夫城和中国柑
    列宁格勒市附近的罗蒙诺索夫城在俄国沙皇时代原叫“奥兰年堡”。而“奥兰年堡”是附属于彼得堡京城的一片带有暖室的柑子园。“奥兰年堡”是个外来语，是从法国字“柑”来的。俄国人把柑叫做“阿别尔西那”，这是由两个外来语“阿别尔”与“西那”合成的。“阿别尔”是“苹果”之意；“西那”是“中国”之意，也就是说俄国人把柑叫做“中国苹果”。
    柑从中国传到印度，又从印度传到古罗马，罗马花匠曾把未成熟的柑用粘土模或石膏模罩起来而使成熟的柑变为杯、碗等各种器皿的形状。后来法国人找到了柑种就在法国土地上培养起中国柑来。俄国人在十二世纪时从法国进口中国柑苗，并把柑树苗栽在木桶里，养在暖室中，从此中国柑就在俄国土地上传下了后代。　（文宏编译）
