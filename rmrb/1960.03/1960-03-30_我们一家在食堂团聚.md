	"Our Family Reunited at the Canteen"
	Cai Yichun

	A few days ago, taking advantage of work, I came to the canteen of the Liu Chen Production Team in the Changqing Management Area of the Changsheng People's Commune in Aohan Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. As soon as I entered the room, I saw a young woman with a blue cloth apron tied around her waist and her sleeves rolled up, skillfully cutting cabbage. After cutting a few, she put down the knife and went to add firewood to the stove, then lifted the lid of the pot and used a rice paddle to turn over the boiling cornmeal rice, covered the pot, and ran back to cut vegetables. Judging from her free and easy, clean and neat work, you could tell at a glance that she was a red and expert hand. Upon inquiry, it turned out that this was Wang Caixia, a well-known model cook in the commune's public canteen.

	In September 1958, as soon as the commune's public canteen was established, she volunteered to serve as a cook. She said, "It doesn't matter if I start early and work late to cook for everyone. With the canteen, the women in our production team don't have to get up early and work late to cook." How much she loves canteen work! But who knew that Wang Caixia had separated from her mother-in-law and affected her relationship with her husband because of cooking at home!

	Wang Caixia is twenty-one years old this year. She married Wang Xuekuan from the same team in 1957. The young couple competed with each other in labor and took care of each other in life. Wang Caixia has a good physique, and when she works, not to mention the girls, even the young lads can't keep up with her. Last autumn, when deep plowing the land, the young men plowed two ridges, and she plowed three. When the news spread, even the director of the management area's women, Ji Yulan, didn't believe it. She specially ran five miles to visit the site. Sure enough, the young men were sweating profusely, and they hadn't even finished two ridges, but Wang Caixia had finished plowing three ridges and stood on the edge of the field shouting, "Come on, young men!"

	Wang Caixia is a very competitive person, and she wants to be ahead of others in whatever she does. Sometimes, when she is eating, as soon as the whistle blows for work in the fields, she puts down her rice bowl and says to her mother-in-law, "Mom, please clean up the table and wash the dishes after you finish eating. The whistle has blown for work, and I have to go." After saying that, she picks up her farm tools and runs off. Often, because of these things, her mother-in-law is dissatisfied and often tells others, "Our daughter-in-law only cares about outside work and doesn't care about the family. She always pushes some odd jobs onto me." Once, her mother-in-law said to Wang Caixia, "Tidy up the housework neatly before you go. Don't wait for me to do everything. I can't do it for you for the rest of my life." Wang Caixia was also very angry when she heard this. She thought to herself, "It's not like you can't walk or move. You still complain about doing some odd jobs." So she argued with her mother-in-law. Wang Caixia said, "I work all day in the fields, and when I come home, I still have to get up early and work late to cook. Sometimes you, old woman, are unwilling to tidy up the table and wash the dishes, and you still tell others that I only care about outside work and don't care about the family." The two women often argued and quarreled over cooking and washing dishes. Finally, the two women couldn't live together because of cooking and separated. Although Wang Xuekuan knew that the separation wasn't Wang Caixia's fault, he still complained that she wasn't good to her mother-in-law, and the young couple's relationship wasn't as good as before.

	In 1958, the commune was established, and canteens were set up in each production team. Wang Caixia was overjoyed and was the first to sign up to be a cook. Ji Yulan, the director of the management area's women, joked with her, "You, the daughter-in-law, separated from your mother-in-law because of cooking. Why are you asking to be a cook now?" She said, "I don't not want to cook, I'm just afraid that cooking will affect our women from working in the fields." Then, the production team leader, Liu Chen, asked her, "Wang Caixia, are you willing to live with your mother-in-law again?" She blushed and said, "I agree to live with my mother-in-law, but I'm afraid my mother-in-law is unwilling." The mother-in-law had long been willing to live together again. She said, "I won't argue about cooking anymore. Who wouldn't want to live with their son and daughter-in-law?"

	Now, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are very close. Once, Wang Caixia woke up in the middle of the night and saw that the moonlight was very bright. Thinking that it was dawn, she jumped up to go to the canteen to cook. Her mother-in-law grabbed her and said, "Silly child, it's moonlight, it's not even midnight yet. Go back to sleep. I'll wake you up when it's time to get up." The relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is so good, not to mention the relationship between the young couple. Whenever her mother-in-law talks about the canteen with others, she says, "The canteen is really good, it has reunited our family."

### “我们一家在食堂团聚”

    “我们一家在食堂团聚”
    才仪春
    前几天，我趁工作方便，来到了内蒙古自治区敖汉旗长胜人民公社长青管理区刘臣生产队食堂。一进屋就看见一个年青妇女，腰上扎着条蓝市布围裙，卷着袄袖，正在熟练地切着白菜。切几棵后，放下菜刀又去添灶膛里的柴禾，然后揭开锅用饭铲子把开锅的包米饭翻了翻个，盖上锅又跑回来切菜。从她干活的洒脱、干净俐落，一看就知道她是个又红又专的能手。一打听，原来这就是公社有名的公共食堂模范炊事员王彩霞。
    在1958年9月公社公共食堂一成立，她就自告奋勇的担任了炊事员。她说：“我给大伙做饭起点早、贪点黑算不了什么，有了食堂，咱们生产队的妇女就都不用起早、摸黑做饭了。”她是多么热爱食堂工作啊！可是，谁知道王彩霞就因为在家烧火做饭的事，还和婆婆分了家，影响了夫妻感情呢！
    王彩霞今年二十一岁，1957年和本队王学宽结了婚。小两口在劳动上比赛着干，生活上互相体贴。王彩霞身板好，干起活来不用说姑娘们，青年小伙子们也休想拉下她一步。去年秋天深翻地时，小伙子们翻两条垅，她就翻三条垅。事情传开了，就连管理区妇女主任纪玉兰也不信，她特意跑了五里地去现场参观，一看可不是，小伙子们累的满头大汗，两条垅还没到头，人家王彩霞挖完三条垅站在地头上高喊：“小伙子们加油哩！”
    王彩霞是个很要强的人，无论干啥都要走在别人前头。有时她正在吃饭，下地干活的哨子一响，她把饭碗一撂，就向婆婆说：“妈，吃完饭你拾掇桌子洗洗碗吧，吹下地哨子了，我该走了。”说完拿起农具就跑了。往往就因为这些事，引起了婆婆的不满，时常和外人说：“我们那媳妇是顾外不顾家，有些零活来不来就往我身上推了。”有一回她婆婆向王彩霞说：“把家里的活计拾掇俐索再走，别都等着我做，我不能给你们做一辈子。”王彩霞一听也很生气，心里想：你不是走不动爬不动的，干点零活还说三道四的。就和婆婆顶起嘴来了。王彩霞说：“我白天干一天活，回家还得起大早贪大黑的做饭，有时你老人家拾掇拾掇桌子洗一洗碗就不愿意了，还和外人说我顾外不顾家。”娘两个经常因为做饭、洗碗顶嘴吵架。娘两个终于因为烧火做饭的事过不到一起，把家分开了。王学宽虽然知道分家不怨王彩霞，可是老埋怨她对婆婆不好，小两口的感情也不如过去好了。
    1958年成立了公社，在各生产队建立了食堂。这下子王彩霞可乐坏了，她第一个报名当炊事员。管理区妇女主任纪玉兰和她开玩笑说：“你这个媳妇，因为烧火做饭和婆婆分了家，这回怎么又要求当炊事员呢？”她说：“我不是不愿意做饭，我是怕做饭影响咱们妇女下地干活。”接着，生产队长刘臣问她：“王彩霞，你愿和婆婆合在一起吗？”她红着脸说：“我同意和婆婆在一起过，就怕我婆婆不愿意。”婆婆呢，早就愿意再在一块过了，她说：“这回再也不因为烧火做饭的事顶嘴了。谁还不愿意和儿子、媳妇在一起过呢？”
    现在，婆媳两个可好了，有一次，王彩霞睡到半夜，看见月亮地很亮，寻思天明了呢，一骨碌爬起来就要到食堂做饭去。她婆婆一把拉住她说：“傻孩子，这是月亮地，天还没到半夜呢，好好睡吧。到起来的时候妈召唤你。”婆媳感情是这样好，人家小两口的感情还用说吗。她婆婆和别人一谈起食堂来就说：“食堂可真好，使我们一家人团聚了。”
