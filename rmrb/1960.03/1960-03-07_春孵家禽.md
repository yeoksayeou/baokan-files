Spring Incubation of Poultry
Chickens and ducks hatch early, grow fast, and lay more eggs
Shuangshi Brigade starts spring incubation early

The Shuangshi Brigade of the Wulidui Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, appropriately advanced the poultry incubation time. Now, the entire brigade has hatched more than 22,000 chicks and ducklings, and another 35,000 eggs have been placed in incubators.

Last spring, the brigade hatched a total of 45,000 poultry, of which 17,500 were hatched five days before the Beginning of Spring (lichun). Chickens hatched early weighed an average of more than two catties each by August, and more than half of them began laying eggs. Chickens and ducks hatched after the Awakening of Insects (jingzhe) only weighed an average of one and a half catties by August, and the time when more than half of them began laying eggs was two months later than those hatched earlier. The brigade actively develops poultry farming, and 28 public canteens have built incubation rooms.

The entire brigade has also trained more than 300 incubation technicians to guide the incubation work. Now, the spring incubation work in the entire brigade is continuing.

Binhai County Builds Many Hatcheries

The number of poultry hatcheries in the communes of Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, has increased from the original seven to twenty-eight.

The communes in the county have expanded and developed hatcheries in accordance with the requirements of large-scale development of poultry. In the construction of hatcheries, they adopted indigenous methods, making use of whatever was available. In order to facilitate the timely purchase of seed eggs, the commune hatcheries and the production brigades have signed contracts for the purchase of seed eggs and the supply of chicks.

Beijing Heping Commune Hatches Large Numbers of Ducklings

The poultry production team of the Heping Commune in Chaoyang District, Beijing, started incubation work more than two months earlier than in previous years, and by the end of February, it had hatched more than 23,000 ducklings.

The production team originally lacked experience in raising ducklings and the equipment was not complete. After sending people to learn from other places, the members have mastered the operating procedures of incubation and overcome the difficulties of lack of experience and insufficient equipment. For example, without warm kangs (heated platforms) in the duck houses, they used old materials to build temporary warm beds to keep the ducklings from freezing; lacking green fodder, they adopted the method of frequent feeding and watering to ensure high survival rate and fast growth of the ducklings.

Baking Room Incubation of Chickens

The Qinghai, Shalong, and Banqiao management areas of Xiangyun County, Yunnan Province, recently used baking rooms to hatch 715 chicks, with a survival rate of 90 percent.

The method of incubating chickens in baking rooms is simple and easy. Small baking rooms (seven feet square) are built in a sheltered, warm, well-ventilated, and sunny place, with windows opened on all four sides. Simple chicken incubation racks are set up in the baking room, covered with a layer of rice bran, and the chicken nests are prepared and the eggs are placed in them. Then a fire is lit in the baking room, and the eggs are turned three times a day. In about twenty days, the chickens can hatch. After the chicks are born, they can be raised in the baking room for a day or two before being released for feeding.

    春孵家禽
    鸡鸭孵化早长得快产蛋多
    双狮大队提前春孵
    湖南宁乡县五里堆公社双狮大队适当提早家禽孵化时间，现在全队已孵出小鸡、小鸭共二万二千多只，还有三万五千枚种蛋已上桶开孵。
    去年春季，这个大队共孵化家禽四万五千只，其中有一万七千五百只是在立春前五天开孵的。提早孵出的鸡，到8月间，每只平均体重二斤多，其中有一半以上开始生蛋。而在惊蛰开孵的鸡鸭，到8月间，平均体重只有一斤半，其中一半以上生蛋的时间比早孵的晚两个月。这个大队积极发展家禽饲养，有二十八个公共食堂建起了孵房。
    全队还培养了三百多名孵化技术人员，指导孵化工作。现在，全队的春孵工作，正在继续开展。

    滨海县大建孵化场
    江苏省滨海县各公社的家禽孵化场已由原来的七个发展到二十八个。
    这个县各公社根据大量发展家禽的要求，都扩大和发展了孵化场。在兴建孵化场时，采取了土法上马，因陋就简的办法。为了便利及时收购种蛋，公社的孵化场和各生产大队订立了收购种蛋和供应雏鸡的合同。
    北京和平公社孵出大批雏鸭
    北京市朝阳区和平公社家禽生产队，比往年提早两个多月开始孵化工作，到2月底已孵出雏鸭二万三千多只。
    这个生产队原来孵育小鸭的经验不足，设备也不齐全，经过派人到各地学习，现在社员们掌握了孵化的操作规程，克服了缺乏经验和设备不足的困难。例如鸭舍里没有暖炕，他们就利用旧材料临时搭暖床，使小鸭不受冻；缺乏青饲料，就采取勤喂勤饮水的办法，使小鸭成活率高，长得也快。
    烤房孵鸡
    云南省祥云县青海、砂龙、板桥等管理区最近用烤房孵出小鸡七百一十五只，成活率达百分之九十。
    烤房孵鸡的办法简单易行，在避风、暖和、空气好、阳光充足的地方建造小烤房（七尺见方），四面开窗。烤房内设简易孵鸡架，架上铺上一层米糠，垫好鸡窝，放好蛋。然后在烤房内生火，每天翻蛋三次，二十天左右，就能破壳出鸡。小鸡出世以后，在烤房内养一两天，就可以放出来饲养。
