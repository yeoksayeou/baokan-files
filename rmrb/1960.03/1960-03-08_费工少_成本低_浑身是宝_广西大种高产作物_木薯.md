Labor-saving, Low-cost, and Valuable All Over:
    Guangxi Promotes High-Yield Crop – Cassava
    Nanning, March 7th (Our Dispatch) – The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is vigorously developing cassava production. This is a production increase measure that requires little labor, has low costs, and yields great results.
    This year, the Autonomous Region plans to plant six million mu of cassava, more than three times the planted area of last year. To date, 5.5 million mu of cassava have been planted.
    Cassava is a high-yield economic crop in subtropical regions. Local cassava can produce 600 to 1,000 jin per mu, and excellent varieties can yield up to 2,000 jin per mu. Cassava can not only be eaten by people, but also can be processed into various industrial raw materials, and cassava leaves can be used to raise fish, silkworms, and feed pigs. Therefore, the masses unanimously praise: "Cassava is good, cassava is good, cassava is a treasure all over."
    Cassava has strong adaptability and can be planted in virgin land, cultivated wasteland, sandy soil, and red soil; after planting, it does not require as much intensive management as staple food crops. Therefore, it can avoid the contradiction of competing with other food crops for land and labor.
    Many areas in Guangxi have traditionally planted cassava, but because they did not know how to utilize it comprehensively in the past, most of it was only used for food or feed, and this "treasure" did not attract people's attention. In early August of last year, the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience of the Luodong Original Seed Farm in increasing cassava production and the experience of comprehensive processing and utilization. This experience was quickly promoted throughout the Autonomous Region. As a result, a mass movement to develop cassava production was enthusiastically launched in various parts of the Autonomous Region. Since last winter, various regions have vigorously reclaimed wasteland for planting cassava, based on the characteristic of Guangxi having a lot of wasteland. To date, the entire Autonomous Region has reclaimed more than 10 million mu of wasteland. (You Yanling)

    费工少　成本低　浑身是宝
    广西大种高产作物——木薯
    本报南宁7日电　广西僮族自治区大力发展木薯生产。这是一项费工少、成本低、收效大的增产措施。
    今年自治区计划种木薯六百万亩，比去年扩大种植面积三倍多。到目前为止，已种下木薯五百五十万亩。
    木薯是亚热带的一种高产经济作物。当地木薯每亩可产六七百斤到一千斤，优良品种亩产可达二千斤。木薯不仅可以人吃，加工后可作多种工业原料，薯叶可以养鱼、养蚕、喂猪。因此群众一致称赞说：“木薯好，木薯好，木薯全身都是宝。”
    木薯的适应性强，无论生荒地、熟荒地、沙壤土、红壤土都能种植；种植后又不要像主粮那样花费很多人工精管。因此，它可以避免与其他粮食作物争地、争劳力的矛盾。
    广西许多地区历来都有种植木薯的习惯，但由于过去不会综合利用，大多只用来作食用或饲料，这个“宝”就未引起人们的重视。去年8月初，中共柳州地委总结了洛东原种场种植木薯增产的经验和加工综合利用的经验后，这一经验便迅速地在全自治区推广开来。于是，一个发展木薯生产的群众运动便在自治区各地热烈展开。去冬以来各地根据广西荒地多的特点，大力进行开荒种木薯。到目前为止，全自治区已开荒一千多万亩。　　　（游延苓）
