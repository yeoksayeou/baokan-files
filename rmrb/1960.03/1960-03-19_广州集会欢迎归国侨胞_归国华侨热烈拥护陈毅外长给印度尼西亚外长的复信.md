Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 18th. Xu Rongguan, a representative of the more than 1,200 Indonesian overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland yesterday aboard the "Zhizhalianga" ship, said at a welcome rally held in Guangzhou today that Foreign Minister Chen Yi’s letter of reply to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on March 15th once again demonstrated the motherland's concern for overseas Chinese and its positive attitude towards resolving the Indonesian Chinese issue. He said that all of us returned overseas Chinese wholeheartedly support the suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his reply.

This returned overseas Chinese, who had lived in Indonesia for more than 20 years, said that although the Indonesian authorities have stated that they will no longer obstruct and will provide assistance to overseas Chinese who wish to return to China, in fact, when overseas Chinese return to China, they still encounter various unreasonable obstructions and difficulties. Our return this time was delayed for more than 20 days in Jakarta because Indonesian vested interest groups used various excuses to obstruct it. We returned overseas Chinese are all indignant at the various obstructions by Indonesian vested interest groups.

The welcome rally was held by the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China. At the beginning of the rally, Zhong Qingfa, Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, on behalf of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, extended a warm welcome and sincere greetings to the overseas Chinese who returned to the warm embrace of the motherland yesterday.

Zhong Qingfa said that under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, Indonesian vested interest groups have launched anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, forcing our overseas Chinese in Indonesia to lose their livelihoods and fall into extreme hardship. The motherland government has expressed serious protests. He said that the motherland government has dispatched batches of ships to Indonesia to pick up overseas Chinese returning to China, and we will continue to send more batches of ships to Indonesia to pick up overseas Chinese. However, the Indonesian side has taken the opposite attitude. While verbally saying that they are willing to assist overseas Chinese in returning to China, they are actually obstructing overseas Chinese from returning, causing various difficulties for overseas Chinese who want to return, which cannot but arouse indignation.

Zhong Qingfa said that the powerful motherland is the backing of the overseas Chinese. Since Indonesia will not let you live there, and you are willing to return to the motherland, we express a warm welcome. Your return will add to the strength of the motherland's socialist construction. Your lives and work will soon be properly arranged.

Yang Changquan, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese Office, extended a warm welcome to the returned overseas Chinese on behalf of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese. He gave a detailed introduction to the development of various construction undertakings in Fujian Province at the meeting and warmly welcomed the returned overseas Chinese to settle in Fujian.

A soiree was also held at the Overseas Chinese Guest House tonight to welcome this group of returned overseas Chinese.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 18th. This afternoon, more than 600 Indonesian overseas Chinese arrived at Huangpu Port aboard the "Da Bao An" ship and were warmly received by the people of the motherland.

At 3:30 pm, the "Da Bao An" ship slowly sailed towards the port. The reception staff and returned overseas Chinese students who went to the wharf to greet the overseas Chinese warmly applauded to welcome the returned overseas Chinese. The returned overseas Chinese stood on the deck of the ship and kept shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the New China!" to the welcomers. The returned overseas Chinese youths forgot the fatigue of the journey and were still playing the harmonica on the deck, singing "Unity is Strength" in unison. The singing and applause resounded throughout Huangpu Port.

The overseas Chinese were warmly received as soon as they landed. Zhong Qingfa, Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, members Li Mei, Cai Zhongchang, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and others who came to greet them, shook hands with the overseas Chinese cordially to congratulate them on returning to the embrace of the motherland. The reception staff helped the old and the young, took luggage for the overseas Chinese, put them on the train, and sent them to the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Remedial School and the Sanyuanli Overseas Chinese Guest House for rest.

Among this group of Indonesian returned overseas Chinese, there were more than 200 overseas Chinese students, and some were white-haired old carpenters. Liu Bin, a 75-year-old carpenter, pointed to a broken iron bucket he was carrying, which contained a pair of old wooden clogs, a pair of bamboo chopsticks, and a mouthwash cup. He said with great emotion: I have worked hard in Indonesia for 50 years, and now I am returning with nothing but a few old clothes and this broken iron bucket. If it were not for the care and help of the motherland, I am afraid this old life would not have been able to return.

    广州集会欢迎归国侨胞
    归国华侨热烈拥护陈毅外长给印度尼西亚外长的复信
    据新华社广州18日电　昨天乘“芝楂连加”号轮船回到祖国的一千二百多名印度尼西亚侨胞的代表徐荣官，今天在广州举行的欢迎大会上说，陈毅外长3月15日写给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的复信，再一次表明了祖国政府对海外华侨的关怀，以及对解决印度尼西亚华侨问题的积极态度。他说，我们全体归侨衷心拥护陈毅外长在复信中所提出的建议。
    这位在印度尼西亚居住了二十多年的归侨说，印度尼西亚当局虽然表示对愿意回国的华侨不再阻挠并且给予帮助，但是事实上，当华侨回国的时候，仍然受到种种无理阻挠和刁难。我们这次回国，就是因为印度尼西亚有势力集团用种种借口阻挠，在雅加达逗留了二十多天之久。对于印度尼西亚有势力集团的种种刁难，我们归侨无不愤慨。
    这个欢迎大会是由中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室举行的。大会开始时，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室主任、华侨事务委员会办公厅主任钟庆发，代表中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会和华侨事务委员会，向昨天回到祖国温暖怀抱的侨胞表示热烈的欢迎，并致以亲切的慰问。
    钟庆发说，印度尼西亚有势力集团在美帝国主义煽动下掀起反华排华活动，使我国在印度尼西亚的侨胞被迫丧失生计，陷于极端困苦的境地，祖国政府曾表示严正抗议。他说，祖国政府已经派出一批二批的船只去印度尼西亚接运华侨回国，我们还继续派更多批的船只去印度尼西亚接运华侨回来。但是，印度尼西亚方面却采取相反的态度，他们口头上也说愿意协助华侨回国，但实际上却阻挠华侨回国，使要求回国的华侨受到种种刁难，这不能不使人对此表示愤慨。
    钟庆发说，强大的祖国是华侨的靠山。既然印度尼西亚不让你们住下去，你们愿意回到祖国来，我们表示热烈欢迎。你们回来，祖国社会主义建设又增添一分力量。你们的生活、工作将很快就会得到妥善的安置。
    福建省接待和安置归国华侨委员会办公室副主任杨长全，代表福建省接待和安置归国华侨委员会，对归侨们表示热烈欢迎。他在会上详细地介绍了福建省各方面建设事业的发展情况，热诚地欢迎归侨们到福建去安家。
    今天晚上，在华侨招待所里还举行了晚会，欢迎这批归国的华侨。
    据新华社广州18日电　今天下午，又有六百多名印度尼西亚侨胞乘“大宝安”号轮船抵达黄埔港，受到祖国人民的热情接待。
    下午三时三十分，“大宝安”号轮船徐徐向港岸驶来，前往码头迎接侨胞的接待工作人员和归国华侨学生们，热烈鼓掌欢迎归侨。归侨们站在轮船的甲板上向欢迎的人们不断高呼“毛主席万岁！”、“新中国万岁！”归侨青年们忘了旅途的疲劳，还在甲板上吹着口琴，同声歌唱“团结就是力量”。歌声掌声响彻了黄埔港。
    侨胞们一上岸，就受到了热情的接待。前来迎接他们的中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室主任钟庆发、委员李梅和全国侨联常务委员蔡钟长等，亲切地同侨胞们握手，祝贺他们回到祖国的怀抱。接待工作人员扶老携幼，给侨胞们拿行李，把他们送上火车，送他们分别到广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校和三元里华侨招待所休息。
    这批印度尼西亚归侨中，有二百多名华侨学生，另外有一些人是白发苍苍的老木工。七十五岁的老木工刘彬指着随身提的一个破铁桶，里面装了一对旧木屐、一对竹筷子和一个漱口盂，他万分感慨地说：我在印度尼西亚辛苦了五十年，如今回来除了几套旧衣服和这个破铁桶，一无所有。如果不是祖国的关怀和帮助，这条老命怕也回不来了。
