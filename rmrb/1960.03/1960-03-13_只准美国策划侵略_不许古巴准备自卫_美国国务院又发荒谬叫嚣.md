Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 12th: U.S. State Department Press Officer Tally issued a threatening statement yesterday regarding the Cuban government's purchase of arms for self-defense. He insisted that Cuba's purchase of defensive weapons was an "arms race," and said that the U.S. government "has taken note of the Cuban government's purchase of a large quantity of arms"; the U.S. government "has ample reason" to believe that "any kind of arms race in the Caribbean will only create a more tense situation in the region."

The U.S. authorities' statement, issued after fabricating the "La Coubre" ship explosion incident, shows that the U.S. is not only desperately trying to prevent Cuba from obtaining weapons for self-defense, but is also plotting to use this issue to instigate armed intervention against Cuba. When exposing the U.S.'s intention in fabricating the "La Coubre" incident, the Cuban "Revolution Newspaper" pointed out on the 7th that the U.S. was attempting to focus attention on the fact that Cuba was acquiring arms, thereby inciting dictatorial countries in the Caribbean, such as the Dominican Republic, which have always been hostile to Cuba, to "take action" against Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: TASS, New York, March 11th: The United States is intensifying its campaign against the Cuban revolutionary government.

Tompkins, a commentator for the "New York American Journal," clamored for the use of the Monroe Doctrine, saying that in 1954, "the United States and other members of the Organization of American States used this doctrine to remove" the Guatemalan government.

An editorial published in the "New York Mirror" still issued its usual provocative tune, clamoring to "take some steps against Castro now."

In addition, in the United States, there is an increasingly rampant clamor to use "Voice of America" and other powerful radio stations located in the United States and its colony of Puerto Rico to launch a large-scale subversive campaign against Cuba.

    只准美国策划侵略　不许古巴准备自卫
    美国国务院又发荒谬叫嚣
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官塔利昨天就古巴政府为进行自卫而购买军火这件事发表威胁性的谈话。他硬说古巴购买自卫武器是什么“军备竞赛”，说美国政府“注意到古巴政府已经购买了大量军火”；美国政府“有充分的理由”认为，“在加勒比海进行的任何种类的军备竞赛将只会造成这个地区的更加紧张的局势”。
    美国当局在制造“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件以后发表的这项声明，表明美国不仅在拼命阻挠古巴获得自卫的武器，而且在阴谋利用这个问题策动对古巴进行武装干涉。古巴“革命报”7日在揭露美国制造“勒库布尔号”事件的用意时曾经指出，美国企图使注意力集中在古巴正在获得军火这件事情上，从而唆使加勒比海一贯敌视古巴的多米尼加等独裁国家对古巴“采取行动”。
    据新华社11日讯　塔斯社纽约11日讯：美国加紧进行反对古巴革命政府的运动。
    “纽约美国人日报”评论员汤普金斯叫嚣运用门罗主义，他说，1954年“美国和美洲国家组织的其他成员国就是运用这个主义除掉了”危地马拉政府的。
    “纽约镜报”发表的编辑部的文章中仍然发出了它那种惯用的挑衅老调，叫嚷“现在就对卡斯特罗采取某种步骤”。
    此外，在美国，越来越猖狂地叫嚷用“美国之音”和其他设在美国和它的殖民地波多黎各的强大电台，对古巴开展大规模的颠覆运动。
