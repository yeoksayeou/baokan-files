Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, 22nd: News from Johannesburg: A large-scale protest demonstration by Africans against the "Pass Laws" erupted in the Transvaal Province of the Union of South Africa on the 21st. The white authorities dispatched large numbers of soldiers and police, using jet aircraft, armored vehicles, machine guns, tear gas, and other means to carry out bloody suppression. According to preliminary figures, 56 Africans have been killed and 245 wounded.

On the morning of that day, in Vereeniging, 36 miles south of Johannesburg, approximately 12,000 Africans held a demonstration in front of the police station in Sharpeville, a nearby African township, to protest the "Pass Laws" that the South African authorities have long imposed on them. The white authorities initially ordered hundreds of soldiers and police equipped with six armored vehicles to beat the Africans with batons and throw tear gas at them. After their attempts to disperse the demonstrators failed, the colonial military police then opened fire on the demonstrators with rifles and machine guns, and dispatched a squadron of jet aircraft to swoop down and intimidate the Africans. However, the Africans were not intimidated; instead, these aircraft aroused even greater anger among them.

Subsequently, the white authorities of the Union of South Africa sent reinforcements and used two army transport vehicles, two buses, and a truck to transport a large number of armed police to suppress the demonstration. In addition, the authorities also mobilized the "Civilian Commando," organized by white colonists under the army, to help with the suppression.

After the incident, the road outside the police station was covered in blood. A Reuters reporter admitted that "the air was filled with the stench of blood and death," and that "on the road in the square of this African township, lay the bloody corpses of men, women, and children, looking like a battlefield." A news photographer took photos of "more bloodshed than he had ever seen in South Africa."

On the same day, similar African protest demonstrations also occurred in two other African townships not far from Vereeniging, Bophuthatswana and Evaton. These demonstrations were also subjected to the barbarous suppression by the military police, resulting in many African casualties.

This massive demonstration erupted after the Pan Africanist Congress launched a movement. Three days prior, the Pan Africanist Congress had announced the launch of an "active action" movement and called on Africans to not go to work but to go to the police stations to return their passbooks.

According to Western news agencies, the leaders of the South African Pan Africanist Congress have been arrested by the police.

The atrocities of the white military police have enraged the Africans in South Africa. They sabotaged telephone lines in many places. In Vereeniging, train and bus drivers went on strike, taxis stopped running, many Africans did not go to work, and thousands of people gathered in the streets to protest the atrocities of the South African authorities.

At the same time, the movement against the "Pass Laws" is rapidly unfolding in various locations. In major cities such as Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg, police also suppressed protest demonstrations held by Africans against the "Pass Laws." In Johannesburg, demonstrators continuously shouted slogans such as "Africa, Africa!" (Attached photo)

    抗议种族歧视的“通行证法”
    南非非洲人举行大规模示威
    白人当局进行疯狂镇压　示威群众死伤三百余人
    新华社22日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非联邦德兰斯瓦尔州21日爆发了巨大规模的非洲人反对“通行证法”的抗议示威。白人当局出动大批军警并且使用了喷气式飞机、装甲车、机关枪、催泪弹等进行血腥镇压。据初步数字，已有五十六名非洲人被打死，二百四十五人被打伤。
    当天上午，在约翰内斯堡以南三十六英里的未里尼琴，大约一万二千名非洲人在附近非洲人市镇沙佩维尔的警察局前举行示威，反对南非当局长期以来强加在他们身上的“通行证法”。白人当局最初下令配备有六辆装甲车的数百名军警用警棍殴打非洲人，并向他们投掷催泪弹。在他们驱散示威群众的企图失败之后，殖民军警又用步枪和机关枪扫射示威群众，并调去一队喷气式飞机向非洲人俯冲恫吓。但是非洲人并没有被吓倒，这些飞机反而激起非洲人更大的愤怒。
    随后，南非联邦白人当局又派了援军，并用两辆陆军运输车、两辆公共汽车和一辆卡车载运大批武装警察去镇压。另外，当局还调集了陆军所组织的由白人殖民者组成的“平民突击队”去帮助镇压。
    事件发生后，警察局外面的路上流满了鲜血。路透社记者承认，“到处是血腥和死亡的气息”，“在这个非洲人市镇的广场的路上，躺着男人、女人和小孩的血肉模糊的尸体，看来好像一个战场一样”。一位新闻摄影记者拍下了他“在南非从未见过那样多的流血的照片”。
    当天，在离未里尼琴不远的另外两个非洲人市镇博普赫朗和埃瓦顿地方，也发生了类似的非洲人抗议示威，这些示威也遭到军警的野蛮镇压，有许多非洲人伤亡。
    这次巨大示威是在泛非主义者大会发起运动之后爆发的。在这之前三天，泛非主义者大会曾经宣布发起采取“积极行动”的运动，并号召非洲人不去工作，而到警察所去退还他们的通行证。
    据西方通讯社报道，南非泛非主义者大会的领袖们已被警察逮捕。
    白人军警的暴行激怒了南非的非洲人，他们破坏了许多地方的电话线。在未里尼琴城，为了抗议南非当局的暴行，火车汽车司机举行罢工，出租汽车停驶，许多非洲人不上工，成千的人聚集在街上。
    同时，反对“通行证法”的运动正在各地迅速展开。在开普敦、德班和约翰内斯堡等大城市，也都发生了警察对非洲人为反对“通行证法”而举行抗议示威进行镇压的事件。在约翰内斯堡，示威群众不断高呼“非洲，非洲！”等口号。（附图片）
