Thousands of Rivers and Streams Return to the Fields
Henan: 800,000 People Start Digging Wells and Repairing Old Wells

(Reported by this newspaper) In Henan Province, over 800,000 people, organized into more than 20,000 specialized well-digging teams, are battling across hills and plains, vigorously digging machine wells and building mechanical irrigation and drainage stations. Currently, the province has completed over 30,000 machine wells, with over 20,000 more under construction.

During the well-digging campaign, various regions have been adapting to local conditions, making comprehensive plans, and establishing specialized command centers in the well-digging areas to concentrate manpower and resources, thereby greatly accelerating the speed of well-digging. Kaifeng Prefecture, based on varying natural conditions and soil types, has launched a large-scale "ten million mu," "million mu," and "one hundred thousand mu" machine well area campaign. In some Yellow River irrigated areas and the banks of the Shahe River and east of the Grand Canal in non-Yellow River irrigated areas, a "ten million mu" machine well area is being established. In the old course of the Yellow River, where the terrain is high and the water table is low, a two-million mu machine well area is being established. Each county, based on regional characteristics, is also establishing Yellow River irrigated area machine well areas, low-lying and flood-prone area machine well areas, and upland and mountainous area machine well areas, creating a complete well-canal dual insurance system with large areas nested with small areas.

While digging machine wells, various regions are also paying attention to fully utilizing existing earthen wells and old wells, installing springs within old wells. In mountainous areas unsuitable for digging machine wells, they are vigorously searching for mountain springs, making every effort to open up water sources and expand irrigation areas. While completing 30,000 machine wells, the province has also installed springs in over 16,000 old wells and newly dug over 68,000 earthen brick wells.

The completed machine wells in various regions are demonstrating their great power in the current fight against drought. After the completion of the first million-mu machine well area in Nanyang Prefecture, over 100 water pumps and over 2,000 waterwheels were quickly installed within the area. Thirty thousand professional laborers were organized, and the machine wells alone irrigated over 400,000 mu of land. Combined with gravity irrigation from canals, 98% of the wheat fields in the area were universally watered with reviving water. Over 75% of the more than 10,000 machine wells completed in Xuchang Prefecture have been put into use for drought resistance and wheat irrigation.

Shanxi Learns from Others' Experiences to Expand Irrigation Area

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province is making every effort to expand irrigation areas in the current drought resistance and prevention campaign. Some areas have also launched a competition centered on learning from the experience of reasonable water use in the Xinglong Gorge Irrigation Area of Gansu to expand irrigation areas.

After learning the practices of the Xinglong Gorge Irrigation Area, the Maohe Irrigation Area in Datong City strengthened water conservancy project maintenance and irrigation management, implemented planned water use, and irrigated 500 mu of land with a flow rate of 0.45, averaging 110,000 mu of land irrigated per flow rate. The Zhongmin Irrigation Canal in Yicheng County, which achieved a record of irrigating 110,000 mu of land per flow rate in the winter irrigation last year, recently renovated the rivers, canals, and land in the entire irrigation area under the slogan of "Learn from Xinglong, Catch up with Xinglong." One cubic meter of water per second can irrigate more than 140,000 mu of land per day and night, an increase of 48% in utilization rate compared to the past. According to statistics, among the irrigation areas with more than 10,000 mu in the province, six irrigation areas have reached the standard of irrigating more than 100,000 mu of land with a flow rate of one.

In promoting the advanced experience of the Xinglong Gorge Irrigation Area, various regions have paid attention to summarizing local experience in rational water use in conjunction with local conditions, making rational water use more effective. After summarizing the experience of group well confluence and combined water diversion to irrigate distant and high lands, the Xiaoyan and Qiaotou management areas of Chengguan Commune in Pingyao County expanded the county's high-land irrigation area to 110,000 mu.

Gansu Digs Wells, Springs and Repairs Canals to Speed Up Spring Irrigation Progress

(Reported by this newspaper) Since March 11, the average daily spring irrigation area in Gansu Province has increased by 1.8 times compared to the average daily irrigation area in February.

Wherever wells and springs can be dug in Gansu Province, they are now being dug in large quantities. Various regions have used well water and spring water to irrigate 560,000 mu of farmland. Currently, ice and snow are beginning to melt, and river water volume is increasing. Various regions are rushing to renovate old canals to expand the diversion and water conveyance capacity of old canals. Ninety-eight of the one hundred and twenty-six reservoirs completed in advance in Pingliang Prefecture have begun to store water.

Spring sowing in Gansu has begun on a large scale, and overwintering crops have just revived, both of which urgently need irrigation water. In its instructions requiring all parts of the province to subordinate everything to drought prevention and resistance, the Provincial Party Committee has made a priority of rushing irrigation and speeding up irrigation as the focus of current drought prevention and resistance. More than 1.88 million laborers throughout the province have been invested in the drought resistance campaign. It is estimated that in ten days, a large number of irrigation projects in various regions will be completed in advance, and the irrigation speed can be greatly accelerated. By the end of April, the province's spring irrigation plan can be completed ahead of schedule. (Attached image)

    千水万水一齐归田
    河南八十万人动手打机井修旧井
    本报讯　河南省八十多万人组成的二万多个打井专业队，鏖战山岗原野，大打机井，大建机械排灌站。目前，全省已打成机井三万多眼，正在施工的还有二万多眼。
    在打机井运动中，各地因地制宜，全面规划，并在机井方里建立专门的指挥方，集中人力物力，因而大大加快了打井的速度。开封专区根据自然条件、土质的不同掀起了大搞千万亩、百万亩、十万亩的机井方运动。在部分黄灌区和非黄灌区的沙河两岸、运河以东建立一个“千万亩”机井方，在地势高、水位低的黄河故道地区，建立一个二百万亩机井方，各县还根据地区特点，建立黄灌区机井方，低洼易涝地区机井方，岗地、山地机井方，大方套小方，组成了一个完整的井渠双保险体系。
    各地在打机井的同时，还都注意充分运用原有的土井、旧井，在老井内下泉，并在不适宜于打机井的山区，大找山泉，千方百计的开辟水源，扩大灌溉面积。全省在建成三万眼机井的同时，在旧井下泉一万六千多眼，新打土砖井六万八千多眼。
    各地已打成的机井，在当前抗旱斗争中大展神威。南阳专区第一个百万亩机井方建成以后，迅速在方内安装了一百多部抽水机和二千多部水车，组织三万名专业劳力，仅用机井就浇地四十万亩以上，加上渠道的自流灌溉，方内98％的麦田都普遍浇了一遍返青水。许昌专区已打成的一万多眼机井，75％以上都投入了抗旱浇麦。
    山西学习外地经验扩大浇灌面积
    据新华社太原电　山西省各地在当前抗旱防旱运动中千方百计扩大灌溉面积。部分地区还以学习甘肃兴隆峡灌区合理用水经验为中心开展了扩大灌溉面积的竞赛活动。
    大同市茂河灌区学习兴隆峡灌区的作法后，加强水利工程养护和灌溉管理，实行计划用水，以零点四五个流量的水浇地五百亩，平均每个流量浇地十一万亩。在去年冬浇中就创造了一个流量水浇地十一万亩成绩的翼城县种民灌溉渠，在“学兴隆、赶兴隆”的口号下，最近整修了全灌区的河渠、土地，一秒立方米水每昼夜能浇地十四万亩以上，利用率比过去提高了48％。据统计，在全省万亩以上的灌区中，已有六个灌区达到了一个流量的水浇地十万亩以上的标准。
    在推广兴隆峡灌区的先进经验中，各地都注意结合总结当地合理用水经验，使合理用水越发有成效，平遥县城关公社小沿、桥头等管理区，总结出群井汇流，合流引水浇远地、高地的经验后，全县高地灌溉面积扩大到十一万亩。
    甘肃打井挖泉修渠加快春灌进度
    本报讯　甘肃省从3月11日以来，平均每天春灌面积比2月份平均每天的灌溉面积提高了一点八倍。
    甘肃省各地凡是可以打井挖泉的地方，现在都在大量打井挖泉，各地已利用井水和泉水灌溉农田五十六万亩。目前冰雪开始消融，河水水量增大，各地正突击整修旧有渠道，扩大旧渠引水量和输水能力。平凉专区提前完成的一百二十六座水库，已有九十八座开始蓄水。
    甘肃春播已大面积开始，越冬作物也刚刚返青，都急需灌水。省委在要求全省各地一切服从防旱抗旱的指示中，把突击灌溉、加快灌溉速度作为当前防旱抗旱的中心。全省投入抗旱运动的劳力已达一百八十八万多人。据估计，十天以后，各地还将有大量的灌溉工程提前完工，灌溉速度可大大加快，到4月底，全省春灌计划可提前完成。（附图片）
