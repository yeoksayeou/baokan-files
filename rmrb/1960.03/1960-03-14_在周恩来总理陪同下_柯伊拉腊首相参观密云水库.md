Xinhua News Agency, 13th - The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Koirala, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, today visited the massive construction project of the Miyun Reservoir.

The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by Wang Xian, the chief commander of the reservoir, Liu Peng, and Ji Yunsheng, the deputy chief engineer, and others. Today, Nepal's Minister of Engineering and Transportation, Singh, Minister of Interior and Justice, Upadhyaya, Foreign Affairs Secretary Thapa, and other accompanying Nepalese dignitaries, as well as a Nepalese journalist delegation led by Pande, all went to visit the reservoir.

In the reservoir's auditorium, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Koirala sat side by side, and Wang Xian, the chief commander of the reservoir, introduced the situation of the reservoir to the Nepalese guests. Prime Minister Koirala and the Nepalese guests were very interested in the reservoir project. The Prime Minister asked how many laborers were working. Wang Xian said that at most there were 210,000 people from 180 people's communes, and currently there are more than 83,000 people. The Prime Minister then asked if the reservoir was designed by Chinese engineers and technicians themselves. Wang Xian replied that it was entirely designed by China itself. At this time, Premier Zhou Enlai introduced to the Prime Minister that the main projects of the Miyun Reservoir were designed by teachers and students of the Department of Water Conservancy of Tsinghua University, which is the result of the combination of education and labor production in our country.

After leaving the reservoir's auditorium, the Premier and the Prime Minister successively ascended the two tall main dam projects, overlooking the panoramic view of the reservoir and visiting the construction of the reservoir. Despite the wind and sand, Prime Minister Koirala and the Nepalese guests were very interested in the visit. The Prime Minister especially carefully visited the scene where rope traction machines and belt conveyors transported soil from a very long distance to the dam, replacing a lot of manual labor. On the Chaohe main dam, Prime Minister Koirala and Premier Zhou Enlai met a young technical worker. The young technical worker excitedly told the Prime Minister and the Premier that he was only twenty-two years old. When he first came to the reservoir construction site from the Sijiqing People's Commune, he was just an ordinary laborer who did not understand any technology. Due to working and studying at the reservoir, he has now become a skilled bulldozer operator. Prime Minister Koirala shook hands with him warmly. Now, on the construction site of this reservoir, more than 6,000 people have been transformed from ordinary laborers into technical workers.

Today, the distinguished guests also visited the Huairou Reservoir on the way to the Miyun Reservoir by train. There, Li Hua, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Huairou County Committee, Xie Jing, Deputy County Mayor of Huairou County, and Zhao Guangren, Director of the Reservoir Management Office, all came to warmly welcome the distinguished guests.

Accompanying the distinguished guests on the visit were Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gu Zhuoxin, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Qian Zhengying, Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Pan Zili, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, and others.

After returning to Beijing, the distinguished guests visited the newly built Beijing Railway Station.

The wife of Prime Minister Koirala visited Guangji Temple this morning and was warmly welcomed by Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China. (Attached picture)

    柯伊拉腊首相参观密云水库
    新华社13日讯　尼泊尔王国柯伊拉腊首相由周恩来总理陪同，今天参观了密云水库规模宏大的建设工程。
    贵宾们受到了水库总指挥王宪、刘鹏，副总工程师纪云生等的热烈欢迎。今天，尼泊尔工程和交通大臣辛格，内政和司法大臣乌帕德亚亚，外事秘书塔普和随行的其他尼泊尔贵宾，以及以潘德为首的尼泊尔新闻工作者代表团都前往水库参观。
    在水库的大礼堂里，周恩来总理和柯伊拉腊首相并肩坐在一起，水库总指挥王宪向尼泊尔的贵宾们介绍了水库的情况。柯伊拉腊首相和尼泊尔的贵宾们对这个水库工程非常感兴趣。首相问有多少民工在工作。王宪说，最多时有来自一百八十个人民公社的二十一万人，目前有八万三千多人。首相又问这个水库是不是中国工程技术人员自己设计的，王宪回答说，完全是中国自己设计的。这时，周恩来总理向首相介绍说，密云水库的主要工程都是清华大学的教师和水利系的学生设计的，这是我国教育同劳动生产相结合的结果。
    走出了水库大礼堂以后，总理和首相先后登上两座高大的主坝工程，眺望水库全景，参观水库兴工情况。尽管风沙扑面，但是柯伊拉腊首相和尼泊尔贵宾参观的兴趣很高。首相特别仔细地参观了绳索牵引机和皮带传送机从很远的地方把土运到坝上的情景，它们代替了很多人工劳动。在潮河主坝上，柯伊拉腊首相和周恩来总理会见了一位
  年青的技术工人。这位年青的技术 工人兴奋地告诉首相和总理，他只有二十二岁，刚从四季青人民公社来到水库工地的时候，他还是一个一点技术不懂的普通民工，由于在水库上工作和学习，现在他已经变成一位熟练的推土机手了。柯伊拉腊首相同他热情地握手。现在在这个水库的工地上，已有六千多人由普通民工变成技术工人了。
    今天，贵宾们在乘火车前往密云水库途中还参观了怀柔水库。在那里，中共怀柔县委副书记李华、怀柔县副县长解静和水库管理处主任赵广仁，都来热情欢迎贵宾。
    陪同贵宾们参观的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫，国家计划委员会副主任顾卓新，对外贸易部副部长雷任民，水利电力部副部长钱正英，北京市副市长吴晗，中国驻尼泊尔大使潘自力等人。
