Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 22nd: While vigorously manufacturing and promoting rice transplanters, Guizhou Province is stepping up training of "three-skilled" rice transplanter operators (proficient in operating, repairing, and explaining) to ensure that 50% of the province's paddy fields use rice transplanters this year. At present, the province has trained more than 146,000 rice transplanter operators, and various places are continuing to vigorously train them to achieve two rice transplanter operators per machine.

Judging from the situation of promoting rice transplanters throughout the province last year, in order to maximize the benefits of rice transplanters, in addition to the manufactured rice transplanters meeting the specifications, there must be rice transplanter operators with a certain level of technical skill to operate them in order to ensure high transplanting efficiency and good quality. Therefore, all localities carried out comprehensive planning early and trained a large number of rice transplanter operators. In the past two months, various places have adopted methods such as short-term centralized training, on-site performance visits, master-apprentice instruction, and inviting in and sending out, setting off a wave of enthusiasm for learning and using rice transplanters among the masses. Throughout the province, a trend of "making rice transplanters everywhere, everyone learning to use rice transplanters" has generally emerged. Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture alone opened 252 rice transplanter operator training classes. Tongren County, which first advocated rice transplanter mechanization in the province, has more than 15,000 rice transplanter operators. After hard work, they have basically reached the technical level of Huang Baolan, Guizhou's "rice transplanter red flag bearer." Not only can they operate, repair, and explain, but they have also initially mastered the manufacture and technical appraisal of simple rice transplanters. Many people have been rated as experts or pacesetters.

Rice transplanting skill activities have been widely carried out throughout the province. Party committees at all levels have established a system of centralized evaluation, level-by-level assessment, and field competitions, with party secretaries and cadres taking the lead in learning to use rice transplanters. Before the transplanting season arrived in various places, "fast early rice seedlings" were cultivated and a large number of pine needles were collected to replace seedlings, allowing rice transplanter operators to practice in the fields, effectively improving the technical level of rice transplanter operators.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd: County and commune industrial workers in the Panyu area of ​​Fan-Shun County, Guangdong, have recently imitated 6,700 Guangxi 59-3 type rice transplanters in the past ten days or so, making this area have one rice transplanter for every 85 mu of land on average, basically realizing mechanical transplanting replacing human labor.

In order to speed up the manufacturing speed of rice transplanters and ensure quality to meet the needs of early rice transplanting, the county leadership transferred more than 2,400 carpenters, blacksmiths and other relevant technicians from the county level and communes, brigades, and factories in the Panyu area, all concentrated in Bengshagang, Shiqiao Town, to rush the work. The county-owned factories cleared out a large number of raw materials from the warehouse to supply the needs of manufacturing rice transplanters. The workers of the county agricultural machinery factory first made samples, drew diagrams of the parts, gave centralized explanations and on-site performances, so that the carpenters and blacksmiths from the communes and brigades factories quickly mastered the technology of manufacturing rice transplanters. In the process of rushing the work, the workers carried forward the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, and boldly carried out technical innovations. Zhang Xi and Han Mei, workers at the machinery factory, changed the iron seedling clips from manual chiseling to mechanical chiseling, increasing the efficiency from 26 per hour to 326. Chen Jinhong, a technician from Shilou Commune, used iron sheet to make a sleeve die, changing the past method of hammering by hand, which increased the production efficiency by five times and ensured that the sleeve sizes were uniform and the heights were consistent, all meeting the specifications and quality requirements. Technicians from Wanqingsha Commune used indigenous methods to make a screw-making machine, increasing the number of screws made from 360 per day to more than 800. The carpenters also created a scriber, which increased efficiency by more than ten times. Li Fu, an installation technician from Shawan Commune, worked hard to study the installation of the rotary shaft and changed the installation method, increasing efficiency by six or seven times compared to the past, greatly speeding up the installation speed of the rice transplanter.

    贵州训练大批插秧机手
    广东番禺地区基本实现插秧机械化
    新华社贵阳22日电　贵州省在大力制造、推广插秧机同时，加紧培训会插、会修、会讲的“三会”插秧机手，以保证今年全省50％的稻田使用插秧机插秧。目前全省已培训出插秧机手十四万六千多人，各地仍在继续大力培训，以实现每部插秧机配备两个插秧机手。
    从去年全省推广插秧机的情况看，要使插秧机充分发挥效益，除了制造的插秧机必须符合规格要求以外，还需要有一定技术水平的插秧机手来操作，才能保证插秧工效高、质量好。因此，各地都及早进行全面规划，大量培训插秧机手。两个月来，各地采取短期集中训练、临田表演参观、师傅带徒弟和请进来派出去等方法，在群众中掀起学习和使用插秧机的热潮。全省普遍出现了“处处大造插秧机、人人学用插秧机”的风气。仅黔东南苗族侗族自治州就开了插秧机手训练班二百五十二次。曾向全省首倡插秧机化的铜仁县，有一万五千多名插秧机手，经过苦钻苦练，基本达到了贵州“插秧机红旗手”黄宝兰的技术水平，不仅会插、会修、会讲，还初步掌握了简易插秧机的制造和技术鉴定，不少人已被评为能手或标兵。
    全省广泛开展了插秧练武活动。各级党委都建立集中评比、层层鉴定和田间比武的评比检查制度，党委书记和干部都带头学习使用插秧机。各地在插秧季节未到以前，就培育了“快速早稻秧”和搜集大批松毛代替秧苗，让插秧机手临田练武，有效地提高了插秧机手的技术水平。
    新华社广州22日电　广东番顺县番禺地区的县、社工业职工，在最近十多天里仿制出了六千七百部广西五九—三型插秧机，使这个地区平均八十五亩田有一部插秧机，基本上实现了机械插秧代人忙。
    为了加快插秧机的制造速度和保证质量，满足早稻插秧需要，县领导机关抽调番禺地区县级和公社、大队、工厂的木工、锻工和其他有关技术工人二千四百多人，全部集中在市桥镇崩砂岗赶制。县属工厂在仓库中清理出大批原料材料，供应了制造插秧机的需要。县农具机械厂的职工先做出样本，画出零件的图样，进行集中讲解和现场表演，使公社和大队工厂来的木工和锻工迅速掌握了制造插秧机的技术。在赶制中，职工们发扬了敢想敢干的精神，大胆地进行了技术革新。机械厂工人张锡、韩妹，把铁质秧夹由手工凿改为用机械凿制，使效率由每小时二十六只提高到三百二十六只。石楼公社技工陈锦洪用铁片制成一个轴套工模，改变了过去用手工锤打的方法，使生产效率提高了五倍，并且保证了轴套大小均匀，高低一致，全部合乎规格质量要求。万顷沙公社技工用土办法制成一部螺丝绞床，从每天绞制螺丝三百六十只提高到八百只以上。木工们还创造了一个划线器，工效提高了十多倍。沙弯公社安装技工李福，艰苦钻研回旋轴的安装工作，改变了安装方法，工效比过去提高六、七倍，大大加快了插秧机的安装速度。
