Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The coal industry system is vigorously carrying out model worker selection competitions for various jobs nationwide, organizing large-scale summarization, exchange, matching, and promotion of advanced experiences.

From December of last year to the present, model workers for the four jobs of prop setting, prop removal, electric conveyor maintenance, and electric conveyor moving in coal mines nationwide have been selected at each level. The fifty-seven national model workers who were selected are now taking the complete set of experiences in these four areas that were recently summarized and are forming six promotion teams to go to various regions to spread and promote them. The model workers at all levels for the twenty-three jobs related to coal mine capital construction, including shaft and tunnel excavation and design, have also been fully selected and are further summarizing and exchanging these model workers' advanced experiences to match them into complete sets. Model worker selection competitions for other jobs are being widely carried out. According to statistics from the Fushun, Fuxin, Kailuan, and Datong Mining Bureaus, the number of people participating in the selection competitions at all levels generally accounts for more than 90% of the total number of employees.

After a special study of this vigorously developing situation, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union believe that the model worker selection competition is a new form of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements on the coal industry front, and a new development in the in-depth development of socialist emulation and the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement by the broad masses of coal mine workers since the Great Leap Forward. Through the continuous selection of model workers and the summarization and promotion of their advanced experiences, the production level originally achieved by only a few model workers can be quickly transformed into the production level of the broad masses, thereby effectively promoting the great development of coal mine production and construction. Judging from the model worker selection competitions currently being carried out in various mines, this movement has already shown the following three main characteristics:

First, it fully mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, enabling everyone to participate in the ranks of technical innovation. The model workers for various jobs in the national coal mine system are selected step by step from the group, pithead, mine, mining bureau, management bureau to the national level, using a combination of on-site skill demonstrations and experience exchanges. The selection competition greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of workers to catch up with the advanced and strive for the top. In order to win in the skill demonstrations, the workers in various mines usually intensified their "martial arts practice" and tried every means to improve their operating skills. During the skill demonstration period, new achievements and new experiences appeared everywhere. According to statistics from the Datong Mining Bureau, in the two selection competitions held by the bureau in December of last year and January of this year, eleven major production bottlenecks were overcome, two hundred and seventy-seven new records were created, and 85% of the workers improved their production efficiency in "martial arts practice."

Second, it timely concentrates the best advanced experiences in the country, and after layer-by-layer summarization and improvement, finally achieves matching and standardization. The experiences of the four jobs of prop setting, prop removal, electric conveyor moving, and electric conveyor maintenance, which have been preliminarily matched and standardized by the coal industry department, are summaries of the advanced operating experiences of model workers at all levels. These experiences can adapt to the various different geological and equipment conditions of coal mines in my country.

Third, it uses the fastest speed to promote complete sets of advanced experiences into production. Through on-site skill demonstrations, symposium exchanges, and summarizing advanced experiences in complete sets, these experiences are simultaneously mastered by model workers at all levels participating in the skill demonstrations. In order to give full play to the role of these model workers, the Ministry of Coal Industry has currently established advanced experience promotion stations in the six mining areas of Benxi, Pingxiang, Chongqing, Tongchuan, Xuzhou, and Liaoyuan. After each set of advanced experience is matched, promotion teams composed of the selected national model workers will go to each station to teach the complete set using on-site performance methods. It is estimated that each set of advanced experience can be quickly promoted to all mines across the country in just one or two months.

Now, the Ministry of Coal Industry has further formulated a plan for carrying out model worker selection competitions. It is planned to select 100,000 model workers at all levels from more than 100 jobs in the national coal mine system this year, and at the same time, match and standardize all the advanced experiences in twenty aspects such as production, capital construction, geological exploration, mining machinery manufacturing, and transformation of small coal mines, and promote them universally throughout the country. The coal mine management bureaus and mining bureaus of various provinces have also made model worker selection competitions one of the main forms of leading workers to carry out socialist emulation and technical innovation movements. Some have also formulated a system of regular competitions to make the selection of model workers a regular activity.

### 煤炭系统广泛开展标兵选拔赛  各地先进经验大总结、大交流、大配套、大推广

    煤炭系统广泛开展标兵选拔赛
    各地先进经验大总结、大交流、大配套、大推广
    据新华社15日讯　煤炭工业系统正在全国范围内蓬勃开展各工种的标兵选拔赛，组织先进经验大总结、大交流、大配套和大推广。
    从去年12月到现在，全国煤矿中支柱、回柱、维护电溜子和移电溜子四个工种的标兵，已经逐级选拔完毕。被选拔出来的五十七名全国标兵，正带着不久前总结出来的这四方面的成套经验，组成六个推广队，分赴各地传播推广。煤矿基本建设有关井筒、巷道掘进和设计方面的二十三个工种的各级标兵，也已经全部选拔出来，正在进一步总结和交流这些标兵的先进经验，使它们配组成套。其他各工种的标兵选拔赛正在广泛进行。据抚顺、阜新、开滦、大同等矿务局的统计，参加各级标兵选拔赛的人数，一般都占到职工总数的90％以上。
    煤炭工业部和煤矿工会全国委员会专门研究了这一蓬勃发展的形势以后，认为标兵选拔赛是煤炭工业战线上集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的新形式，是大跃进以来广大煤矿职工深入开展社会主义竞赛、大闹技术革新和技术革命运动的新发展。经过不断地选拔标兵和总结推广标兵的先进经验，可以使原来只有少数标兵达到的生产水平，迅速变成广大群众的生产水平，从而有效地促进煤矿生产建设的大发展。从各矿正在开展的标兵选拔赛情况来看，这一运动已经显示出的特点主要有以下三个：
    首先，它充分调动广大职工群众的积极性，使人人参加到技术革新的行列里来。全国煤矿系统各工种的标兵，是从小组、坑口、矿、矿务局、管理局一直到全国，用现场比武和经验交流相结合的方式逐级选拔出来的。选拔赛大大激发了职工们赶先进、争上游的热情。为了在比武中取得优胜，各矿职工平时就加紧“练武”，千方百计提高操作技术水平；在比武期间，更是到处出现新成绩、新经验。据大同矿务局统计，这个局在去年12月和今年1月举行的两次选拔赛中，就攻破了十一个重大的生产关键，创造了二百七十七次新纪录，并有85％的工人在“练武”中提高了生产效率。
    其次，它把全国最好的先进经验及时集中起来，经过层层总结提高，最后达到配套定型。煤炭工业部门已经初步配套定型的支柱、回柱、移电溜子和维护电溜子四个工种的经验，就是集中了各级标兵的先进操作经验总结起来的。这些经验可以适应目前我国煤矿各种不同的地质和设备条件。
    第三，它用最快的速度，把成套的先进经验推广到生产中去。经过现场比武，座谈交流和成套地总结先进经验，这些经验就同时为参加比武的各级标兵所掌握。为了充分发挥这些标兵的作用，目前煤炭工业部已在本溪、萍乡、重庆、铜川、徐州、辽源六个矿区设立了先进经验推广站，每项先进经验配套以后，就由选拔出来的全国标兵们组成推广队，分别到各站用现场表演的办法成套地传授。每套先进经验估计只要一两个月就能迅速推广到全国各个矿山。
    现在，煤炭工业部已经进一步订出开展标兵选拔赛的规划。计划今年在全国煤矿系统的一百多个工种中，选拔出十万个各级标兵，同时把生产、基本建设、地质勘探、矿山机械制造和改造小煤矿等二十个方面的先进经验，全部配套定型，并在全国普遍推广。各省煤矿管理局和矿务局，也已经把标兵选拔赛作为领导职工开展社会主义竞赛和技术革新运动的主要形式之一。有的还订出了定期比赛的制度，使选拔标兵成为经常性的活动。
