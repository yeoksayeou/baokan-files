Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, March 14th: Prime Minister Abbas of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic delivered a radio address in Tunis today, condemning de Gaulle's recent clamor that France would continue its colonial war in Algeria. He stated that de Gaulle had "closed the door to negotiations and the realization of peace in Algeria," and therefore "the Algerian people and government will continue the national liberation war until independence is achieved."

French President de Gaulle delivered a speech to officers of the French colonial army in Algeria on March 3rd, emphasizing that "only after France achieves armed victory will it be possible to resolve the Algerian problem," and "France must remain in Algeria. In what form? That depends on the Algerians." In response to de Gaulle's clamoring, Prime Minister Abbas pointed out that France should be held responsible for continuing the Algerian war.

Abbas said that since November 1, 1954, the Algerian National Liberation Army has fully demonstrated that it is a fantasy for French colonialists to believe they can use force to crush the heroic resistance of the Algerian people and their will to fight for independence.

He continued, "As for the threat to divide Algeria into ethnic and religious regions, hold local elections, and plan to formulate a law for Algeria in collusion with handpicked elected representatives, the result can only be the continuation of the war."

He said, "In accepting the principle of self-determination as the basis for resolving the Algerian issue, we insist that the faithful implementation of the principle of self-determination must be guaranteed. We have no doubt what the 'free choice' of the Algerian people will be, if this choice is made under indispensable guarantees."

Abbas finally pointed out that de Gaulle wants to continue colonial rule by adopting new methods. Therefore, "we will continue the national liberation war until independence is achieved. Colonialism leaves us no other choice."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 13th: The headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army issued a military communique on the 13th, announcing that from March 8th to 10th, the Algerian army killed 522 French soldiers and wounded 243.

The communique said that during this period, the Algerian army launched fierce attacks on 58 French strongholds, engaged in combat with enemy troops in 13 other locations, and ambushed enemy troops and military convoys 23 times. Algerian sabotage teams also took extensive action against French transportation lines and military facilities. The communique said that during this period, the French army lost 51 military vehicles, two aircraft, and 274 weapons.

    阿尔及利亚人民决心战斗到独立
    阿巴斯总理斥戴高乐的殖民战争叫嚣
    民族解放军连续出击重创法国侵略军
    新华社14日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯今天在突尼斯发表广播演说，谴责戴高乐最近表示法国要在阿尔及利亚继续进行殖民战争的叫嚣。他说，戴高乐已经“关闭了在阿尔及利亚举行谈判和实现和平的大门”，因此“阿尔及利亚人民和政府将继续进行民族解放战争，直到获得独立时为止”。
    法国总统戴高乐本月3日曾经在阿尔及利亚对法国殖民军队的军官发表演说，强调“只有在法国取得武装胜利后，才有可能解决阿尔及利亚问题”，“法国必须留在阿尔及利亚。采取什么形式？这要取决于阿尔及利亚人”。针对着戴高乐的这次叫嚣，阿巴斯总理指出，法国应对继续进行阿尔及利亚战争负责。
    阿巴斯说，自从1954年11月1日以来，阿尔及利亚民族解放军已经充分表明，法国殖民主义者认为他们能够用武力来粉碎阿尔及利亚人民的英勇抵抗和阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的意志，这都是空想。
    他接着说，“至于威胁要把阿尔及利亚分割为种族的和宗教的地区，举行地方选举以及策划在圈定的当选代表的共谋下为阿尔及利亚制订一个法规，其结果只能使战争继续下去。”
    他说，“在接受自决原则作为阿尔及利亚问题解决的基础的时候，我们坚持必须保证忠实执行自决原则。我们毫不怀疑，阿尔及利亚人民的‘自由选择’将是什么，如果这种选择是在不可缺少的保证之下进行的话。”
    阿巴斯最后指出，戴高乐想通过采用新的方法来继续殖民统治。因此，“我们将继续进行民族解放战争，直到获得独立时为止。殖民主义使得我们没有其它路可走。”
    新华社开罗13日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放军总部13日发表军事公报宣布，从3月8日到10日，阿尔及利亚军队打死了法军五百二十二人，打伤了二百四十三人。
    公报说，在这期间，阿尔及利亚军队向法军的五十八个据点发动了猛攻，在其他十三个地方和敌军发生了战斗，并且伏击了敌军和军事运输队二十三次。阿尔及利亚的破坏队也对法军的交通线和军事设施采取了广泛的行动。公报说，在这期间，法军损失了五十一辆军用车、两架飞机和二百七十四件武器。
