Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 4th dispatch: French President De Gaulle left Paris yesterday without announcement and arrived in Algeria.

After arriving in Algeria, De Gaulle delivered several speeches to officers of the French colonial army at various French military strongholds near Constantine. According to Western news agencies, De Gaulle emphasized in these speeches that "France must remain in Algeria." He said that the form in which it remains would depend on the "wishes" of the Algerian residents. De Gaulle's words fully illustrate what he means by Algerian people's "self-determination."

In his speeches, De Gaulle insisted on fighting the colonial war in Algeria to the end. He said that the French army must achieve final victory, and everything depends on this. He said that if victory is not clearly achieved on the battlefield first, then there is nothing to talk about.

De Gaulle stated that first, "peace must be restored by force," in other words, the armed forces of the Algerian people must be eliminated first, and then, after a few years, "the Algerian people will have the right to state their demands." He then used some words to indicate that even then he would not let Algeria become independent. He said he believed that Algerians "will not choose independence" but "will choose to be linked to France."

However, De Gaulle's speeches also revealed the French ruling group's embarrassment in the Algerian colonial war. He told the officers that the Algerian war would continue for many years. He also said that the Algerian issue has become the most intense, difficult, and disheartening problem facing France today.

It is reported that De Gaulle's purpose in going to Algeria this time is to "restore the trust of the extreme colonialists in the local and French armies in him and dispel their doubts about his 'self-determination' plan." As everyone knows, in January, extreme colonialists launched an armed rebellion against De Gaulle in Algiers, and many French officers in the area secretly supported this rebellion.

    丢开“自决”骗局　露出狰狞面目
    戴高乐叫嚷决不放下屠刀
    坚持要用武力维持在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治
    新华社4日讯　阿尔及尔消息：法国总统戴高乐昨天未经宣布就离开巴黎来到阿尔及利亚。
    戴高乐到达阿尔及利亚后在君士坦丁附近的法军各据点对法国殖民军队的军官发表了几次演说。据西方通讯社报道，戴高乐在这些演说中强调“法国必须留在阿尔及利亚”。他说，至于采取什么形式留在这里，将取决于阿尔及利亚居民的“意愿”。戴高乐这些话充分说明了他所谓的阿尔及利亚人民“自决”究竟是什么东西。
    戴高乐在演说中坚持要把法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争打到底。他说，法国军队必须最后取得胜利，一切将取决于此。他说，如果首先不在战场上不容分辨地取得胜利，就什么也谈不上。
    戴高乐表示，首先“必须通过武力恢复和平”，换句话说，先消灭了阿尔及利亚人民的武装力量，然后在几年以后，“阿尔及利亚人才有权说出他们的要求”。他接着用一些话表明，即使在那时他也不会让阿尔及利亚独立的。他说，他相信阿尔及利亚人“不会选择独立”，而“将会选择同法国联系在一起”。
    但是，戴高乐在演说中也流露了法国统治集团在阿尔及利亚殖民战争中焦头烂额的窘态。他向军官们说，阿尔及利亚战争还要长年累月打下去。他还说，阿尔及利亚问题已经成为法国今天面临的最激烈、最困难和最使人寒心的问题。
    有消息说，戴高乐此次去阿尔及利亚的目的是要使当地和法国军队中的极端殖民主义分子“恢复对他的信任和消除他们对他提出的‘自决’计划的怀疑”。大家知道，在1月间，极端殖民主义分子曾在阿尔及尔发动反对戴高乐的武装暴乱，而当地许多法国军官是暗中支持这次暴乱的。
