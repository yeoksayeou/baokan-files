Glimpses of Cuba
    Li Bingquan

It has been almost two months since I left Cuba. Every time I see news about Cuba in the newspapers, the scenes of the Cuban people's fighting life reappear before my eyes. I stayed in Cuba for a week this January. Although the visit was short, I saw the solemn work of the Cuban people, the progress of Cuban social reforms, and felt the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the Cuban people.

The victory and progress of the Cuban people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution have become the banner of the Latin American people's struggle. In Cuba, we vividly saw the Latin American giant stand up. Farmers who had lived under the watch of guns for generations are now taking up guns to defend the sugarcane fields. What a great change this is! In 1959, Cuba began land reform, started reclaiming land controlled by foreign capital, and abolished the blood-sucking hacienda system. U.S. imperialism cursed the land reform, asserting that Cuba's sugar production would inevitably decrease, but the Cuban people responded to the imperialists with the fact of a huge increase in national income. In 1960, land reform made a big step forward, and more than five hundred cooperatives have been organized, and production is increasing. The United States again tried to strangle the Cuban economy by reducing sugar purchases and lowering sugar prices. But Cuba is not isolated, and the people of the world are supporting Cuba. The Soviet Union's purchase of Cuban sugar stabilized sugar prices and promoted production. During this year's sugarcane harvest season, U.S. imperialism simply tore off its mask and sent planes to bomb sugarcane fields at night, with more than thirty consecutive bombings, burning more than 200 million kilograms of sugarcane. But the answer the imperialists received was: angry Cuban people organized people's militias, armed themselves, and resolutely resisted aggression. The raging fire of anti-intervention spread throughout the island of Cuba, and the claws of imperialism were thwarted.

U.S. imperialism stretches out layers of dense blood-sucking disks, clinging tightly to the people of Latin America. The United States thought that by controlling Cuba's sugar, or Chile's copper, or Bolivia's tin and Colombia's coffee, it could strangle the throat of Latin America and arbitrarily control the fate of the people. But in Cuba, we saw the scene after a volcanic eruption. How heroically the people who had suffered from imperialist oppression insisted on fighting, eradicating the forces of imperialism, and resolutely not allowing the past days to return. The fate of the hacienda system is no exception. The hacienda system caused a situation where large areas of land were wasted on the one hand, and a large number of farmers were bankrupt and displaced on the other, which seriously hindered and destroyed the productive forces. In Cuba, sugarcane and tobacco farmers used to have only three or four months of work a year, and the rest of the days were "dead season" with no food or clothing. Now we have also seen the people moving forward with land reform, like a surging torrent, unstoppable for the people to reap the fruits of land reform. U.S. imperialism once raised a butcher, Batista, in Cuba, who bloodily suppressed the people, but the ending was that the broadest masses of people united to oppose the dictator, carried out a long-term armed struggle, and achieved victory. This victory shook the entire Latin America. Every reform of the Cuban people, like a spring breeze and raging fire, quickly spread throughout Latin America. U.S. imperialism vainly attempted to isolate Cuba from Latin American countries, but it had no way to cut off the flesh-and-blood connection between the Cuban people and the Latin American people.

What is most unforgettable is that the hardworking Cuban people are carrying out intense work and rapidly changing the face of life. In the center of Havana, the newly built building of the Land Reform Committee is brightly lit all night. People coming and going to discuss work are waiting for interviews at the reception. Here you can hear the heartbeat of Cuba. It was in this building that we heard introductions about the achievements of land reform, about the prospects for developing a diversified economy, about the grand plan for carrying out afforestation, about the equally grand plan for carrying out rural education and eliminating illiteracy, and so on. In education, the former Batista barracks are being converted into schools. Regarding the economy, national industries are being developed to change the single economic situation, first of all, the production of rice is being developed, and the prospect is to achieve self-sufficiency within three to five years. There are big plans for afforestation, for example, in Pinar del Río province in the west, there used to be pine trees and rivers, but in the difficult years, farmers cut down trees to burn charcoal, the trees were cut down, and the rivers dried up. Now we must restore the forest belt and rivers, the people hold mass meetings, collect seeds, and support the afforestation movement. Also in this province, the people are filling in swamps, building water conservancy projects, and large teams of rebel soldiers are participating in the construction.

We visited cooperatives in Pinar del Río province, saw the fertile land, and also saw the results of land reform—farmers have work, land, houses, and people's stores. Now farmers have work all year round and are eating their fill for the first time. We saw that new villages have been built next to the old thatched huts. Houses painted in brilliant tropical colors are radiant. We also saw the thriving people's stores. In the past, farmers' wages were paid with shopping tickets, and they could only exchange things in the shops opened by the estate owners, and be exploited again. Now the farmers have gotten rid of this slave life, and we saw the happy crowd receiving wages. That night, we met the on-duty farmers' patrol team, who were armed and vigilantly guarding the fields and gardens, protecting the fruits of land reform.

The visit to Cuba has made us more deeply aware that in the 1960s, the flames of struggle in Latin America will be ignited even more vigorously and burn even higher.

    古巴见闻
    李炳泉
    离开古巴快两个月了。每从报纸上看到古巴的新闻时，古巴人民战斗生活的景象就又重现眼前。今年1月，我在古巴住了一个星期。虽然来去匆匆，但看到了古巴人民庄严的工作，看到古巴社会改革的进展，感受到古巴人民高涨的革命热情。
    古巴人民反帝反封建革命的胜利和进展，已经成为拉丁美洲人民斗争的旗帜。我们在古巴形象地看到，拉丁美洲巨人站起来了。世世代代在枪口监视下生活的农民，现在拿起枪来保卫甘蔗田。这是多么大的变化！1959年，古巴开始土改，开始收回了外国资本控制的土地，废除了吸血的大庄园制。美帝国主义诅咒土改，断言古巴的糖一定要减产，但是古巴人民却用国民收入巨大增长的事实，回答了帝国主义者。1960年，土改进展了一大步，五百多个合作社已经组织起来，生产在增长。美国又用减少买糖、压低糖价的办法，企图扼杀古巴的经济。但是古巴不是孤立的，全世界人民在支援古巴。苏联购买古巴的糖，就稳定了糖价，促进了生产。今年甘蔗收割季节里，美帝国主义索性撕开假面具，黑夜派飞机轰炸甘蔗田，接连三十多次轰炸，烧毁两亿多公斤甘蔗。但是帝国主义者得到的答复是：愤怒的古巴人民全民组织民兵，武装起来，坚决反抗侵略。反干涉的熊熊大火，烧遍了古巴全岛，帝国主义的魔爪受到了挫伤。
    美帝国主义伸出层层密密的吸血盘，紧贴在拉丁美洲人民身上。美国满以为控制了古巴的糖，或是智利的铜，或是玻利维亚的锡和哥伦比亚的咖啡，就可以扼住拉丁美洲的喉咙，随心摆布人民的命运。但在古巴，我们却看到了火山爆发后的景象。受尽帝国主义压榨的人民，是怎样英勇地坚持战斗，根除帝国主义的势力，决不容许过去的日子再回来。大庄园制的命运也不例外，大庄园制造成的一方面大片土地荒废，一方面大量农民破产流浪的状况，严重阻碍和破坏了生产力。在古巴，蔗农和烟农过去一年只有三、四个月有工作，其余的日子就是无衣无食的“死季”。现在我们也看到了人民一往直前地进行土地改革，好像奔涛澎湃，一泻千里，谁也拦不住人民去收获土改的果实。美帝国主义曾在古巴豢养了一个屠户巴蒂斯塔，血腥镇压人民，但结局是最广泛的人民团结起来反对独裁者，进行长期的武装斗争，取得了胜利。这胜利震撼了整个拉丁美洲。古巴人民的每一改革，就像春风烈火，迅速传遍拉丁美洲。美帝国主义妄想把古巴从拉丁美洲国家孤立起来，但它决没有办法切断古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民血肉相关的联系。
    使人最难忘的是古巴勤劳的人民，在进行着紧张的工作，迅速改变生活的面貌。在哈瓦那市中心，新建的土改委员会的大楼彻夜灯火通明。川流不息地接洽工作的人，在传达处等候接见。在这里可以听得到古巴心脏的跳动。就在这座大楼里，我们听到关于土改的成果的介绍，关于发展多种经济的前景的介绍，关于开展造林运动的宏大计划，关于开展乡村教育、扫除文盲的同样宏大的计划等等。在教育方面，正在把过去巴蒂斯塔的兵营改为学校。关于经济，正在发展民族工业，改变单一经济状况，首先是发展稻米的生产，前景是三、五年内作到自给。关于造林有很大的计划，譬如在西部的皮那尔德里奥省，过去有松树和河，但在苦难的年代里，农民伐树烧炭，树伐光了，河也干了。现在要重新恢复林带和河流，人民开群众大会，搜集种子，支持造林运动。也在这个省里，人民在填平沼泽，兴修水利，大队的起义军战士参加了建设。
    我们访问了皮那尔德里奥省的合作社，看到了肥得出油的土地，也看到了土改的成果——农民有了工作、土地、房屋和人民商店。现在农民全年都有工作，第一次吃上了饱饭。我们看见在旧日的茅屋旁边，已经兴建了新村。涂着绚丽的热带色泽的房舍，焕发着光采。我们也看到生意兴隆的人民商店。过去，农民的工资是用购物票支付，只能在庄园主开的商店里换东西，再受一次剥削。现在农民已经摆脱了这种奴隶的生活，我们看到了正在领取工资的欢乐的人群。这天晚上，我们遇见出勤的农民巡逻队，他们武装起来，警惕地保卫田园，保卫土改得来的果实。
    在古巴的访问，使我们更深切地认识到，在六十年代里，拉丁美洲的战斗的火焰将点燃得更旺，烧得更高。
