Xinhua News Agency, March 20th - A nationwide upsurge in the spring mating of large livestock is underway, striving to surpass this year's breeding plan.

A significant feature of this year's spring mating campaign for large livestock is the full play given to the superiorities of the people's communes. They have rationally resolved the contradiction between mating and labor, the contradiction between feeding costs and use-value. They have universally established stud farms, breeding farms, and young stock farms, vigorously promoting the breeding of improved varieties.

Across the country, efforts are being intensified to conduct a concentrated spring mating campaign for large livestock, striving to over fulfill this year's large livestock breeding plan.

In previous years, spring mating of large livestock in the north generally started at the end of spring, but this year it began as early as the Spring Festival. Since the beginning of spring, about half of the barren female livestock in Liaoning, Henan, and Hebei have been mated. Currently, approximately 80% of the breeding-age female livestock nationwide, including those already pregnant last year, have been mated. The number of spring matings in various regions has increased compared to the same period last year, with Hebei increasing by more than double and Liaoning increasing by more than triple. Some counties have essentially achieved full mating and pregnancy for all breeding-age female livestock. Some female livestock that were rarely spring-mated in the past are also being bred this year.

Ensuring full pregnancy through spring mating is crucial for the development of large livestock this year. Large livestock have a long gestation period: over nine months for cattle, and eleven months for donkeys and horses, usually with only one offspring per pregnancy. Only by successfully mating in early spring can we ensure the great development of livestock this year. Moreover, spring is the season when female livestock are most likely to be in heat, making successful mating easier, and the calving period can be staggered with the busy farming season. Therefore, Party committees at all levels have recently further strengthened their leadership in this work. People's communes in Shaanxi Province had already broken down the large livestock breeding plan to the production teams at the beginning of the year. After the breeding plan was implemented, regions such as Tianjin, Handan, Baoding, Tangshan, and Shijiazhuang in Hebei immediately carried out a comprehensive inspection to check the implementation of the plan. While inspecting, Deng County and Tanghe County in Henan Province launched competitions revolving around the breeding plan. Shanxi Province launched a "one-full, two-high, three-fast, four-good" competition for full mating and pregnancy, requiring full mating, high conception rate, high utilization rate of breeding stock, fast estrus of female livestock, fast mating, fast conception, good estrus of female livestock, good adjustment of breeding stock, and good feeding management of both male and female livestock.

The nationwide zonal inspection of spring mating and breeding recently organized by the Ministry of Agriculture prominently inspected the implementation and execution of the spring mating plan, exchanged spring mating experiences, and powerfully promoted the development of the large livestock spring mating campaign.

Solving the contradiction between plowing animals' mating and labor, and the contradiction between feeding costs and use value, are key measures that various regions have prominently grasped in this year's large livestock spring mating campaign. This year, North China and Northeast China both started mating two months earlier, staggering it with the busy labor periods of spring plowing and sowing in April and May. Regarding mating methods, most areas across the country have adopted methods such as batch mating, leading stud animals to the fields for mating, mating early in the morning, mating at night, mating at the trough, and mobile patrol mating, to minimize the overlap of mating and labor time. After the people's communes in Henan adopted these methods, 88% of the breeding-age female livestock have been mated and are pregnant. Many regions have also appropriately reduced the labor intensity of female livestock. Agricultural areas near pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia temporarily transferred in a batch of castrated animals to replace some of the female livestock in labor, allowing the female livestock to mate and become pregnant. Many communes in Jilin, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces trained idle livestock for labor, replacing estrus female livestock for mating. In order to ensure pregnancy and improve breeding survival rates, some people's communes in some areas concentrated the scattered female livestock in livestock farms for feeding before and after delivery. Dazhixindian Commune in Penglai, Shandong Province, carefully feeds female livestock in livestock farms for half a month before and after delivery. From May of last year to January of this year, all 150+ young livestock delivered by the livestock farm survived, and all female livestock were heat-mated after delivery, with an accurate pregnancy rate of up to 97%. The main method for southern cattle-raising areas to solve the contradiction between feeding costs and use-value is to make overall arrangements, developing comprehensive utilization of draught cattle for labor, milking, and meat, and accelerating the development of draught cattle.

Establishing stud farms, breeding farms, and young stock farms in the people's communes is an effective way to develop large livestock at high speed. Since the people's communes were established, Jilin Province has established more than 2,400 stud farms, breeding farms, and young stock farms. Provinces such as Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Hunan, and Yunnan are all planning to establish stud farms, breeding farms, and young stock farms on a large scale. Shandong Province plans to establish breeding bases for improved varieties in nineteen counties in the Yimeng Mountains and western and northern Shandong to accelerate the breeding of large livestock.

Establishing a mating and breeding network and promoting improved variety breeding are other powerful measures in this year's large livestock spring mating campaign. Communes in various regions are focusing on local selection and optimization, and are establishing stud stations and artificial insemination stations on a large scale. The mating and breeding network in Heilongjiang Province has taken initial shape. Famous local improved varieties of livestock, such as the Sanhe horse of Inner Mongolia, the Hequ horse of Gansu, the Yili horse of Xinjiang, the Shandong Yellow cattle, the Nanyang Yellow cattle of Henan, the Qinchuan cattle of Shaanxi, the Jinnan Yellow cattle, the Dingxian donkey of Hebei, and the Biyang donkey of Henan, as well as various introduced improved varieties of livestock, have all been further promoted this year. The number of female livestock mated with these improved varieties this year has increased compared to the same period last year. In provinces such as Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin, female livestock mated with improved-variety male livestock account for about half of all mated female livestock. Jilin, Henan, and Hebei provinces have established more than 10,000 mating stations. Henan has basically achieved a mating station in every commune and an insemination point in every team. This spring, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and regions have also vigorously promoted the experience of "one horse mates with three thousand," which not only powerfully promotes the spring mating work, but also is particularly conducive to the breeding of improved varieties.

    全国春季配种运动形成高潮
    大家畜百分之八十怀孕
    各地人民公社发挥巨大优越性，合理解决配种和使役的矛盾、饲养成本和使用价值的矛盾，普遍建立种畜场、繁殖场和幼畜场，大力推广良种繁殖，是今年开展大家畜春配运动的显著特点。
    新华社20日讯　全国各地都在加紧突击大家畜的春季配种工作，力争超额完成今年的大家畜增殖计划。
    往年北方大家畜的春配，一般都在春末开始，今年提早在春节就开始了。辽宁、河南、河北入春以来已有一半左右的空怀母畜配上了种。现在全国春配的母畜，连同去年已怀孕的母畜，约占适龄母畜的80％左右。各地春配数量都比去年同期增多，河北增加一倍多，辽宁增加三倍多，还有一批县已基本上做到了适龄母畜全配满怀。往年很少春配的一些母畜，今年也配种繁殖。
    春配保满怀是今年发展大家畜的关键。大家畜怀孕期长，牛九个多月，驴、马十一个多月，一般是一胎一仔。只有在早春配准了，才能保证今年牲畜大发展。而且春季是母畜发情旺的季节，容易配准，产仔期又能和农忙错开。因此，最近各级党委都进一步加强了对这一工作的领导。陕西省的人民公社早在年初就已把大家畜繁殖计划落实到生产队。河北天津、邯郸、保定、唐山、石家庄等地区在繁殖计划落实以后，立即开展了全面大检查，检查计划执行情况。河南邓县、唐河等七县一边检查，一边还围绕繁殖计划展开了竞赛。山西省开展了“一全二高三快四好”的全配满怀竞赛，要求做到全配，受胎率高、种畜利用率高，母畜发情快、配种快、受胎快，母畜发情好、种畜调剂好、公畜和母畜饲养管理好。
    农业部最近组织的全国分区春配繁殖大检查，突出地检查了春配计划落实和执行情况，交流了春配经验，有力地推动了大家畜春配运动的发展。
    解决耕畜配种和劳役的矛盾、饲养成本和使用价值的矛盾，是今年大家畜春配运动中各地突出抓住的一项关键性的措施。华北地区和东北地区今年都提早两个月配种，错开了4、5月春耕春播的大忙使役期。在配种方式上，全国大部地区都采用分批配、牵种公畜下田配、清早配、夜间配、槽头配、游动巡回配等办法，尽量使配种、使役时间错开。河南各人民公社采用这些办法后，有88％的适龄母畜都已配种怀了孕。许多地区还适当减轻了母畜的劳役强度。内蒙古临近牧区的农业区，从牧区临时调进一批阉畜顶替一部分母畜劳役，使母畜配种怀孕。吉林、江苏、江西、四川等省许多公社训练闲散牲畜使役，替换发情母畜配种。为了保胎和提高繁殖成活率，有些地区的人民公社把分散的母畜，在产前产后集中在畜产院饲养。山东蓬莱大辛店公社让母畜在产前产后在畜产院精心饲养半月，从去年5月到今年1月，畜产院接产的一百五十多头仔畜全部成活，而且全部母畜都在产仔后进行了热配，准胎率高达97％。南方养牛地区解决饲养成本和使用价值的矛盾，主要办法是全面安排，发展耕牛使役、挤乳、肉食等综合利用，加速发展耕牛。
    人民公社建立种畜场、繁殖场和幼畜场，是高速度发展大家畜的有效办法。吉林省从人民公社化以来已经建立种畜场、繁殖场、幼畜场二千四百多处。辽宁、黑龙江、山西、山东、河北、湖北、湖南和云南等省，都计划大办种畜场、繁殖场、幼畜培育场。山东省计划在沂蒙山区和鲁西、鲁北等地区的十九个县建立良种繁殖基地，加速繁殖大家畜。
    建立配种殖繁网，推广良种繁殖，是今年大家畜春配运动的另一项有力措施。各地公社都以就地选优为主，大办种畜站和人工授精站。黑龙江省的配种繁殖网已初步形成。著名的内蒙古三河马、甘肃河曲马、新疆伊犁马、山东黄牛、河南南阳黄牛、陕西秦川牛、晋南黄牛、河北定县驴、河南泌阳驴等数以百计的当地良种牲畜和各种引进良种牲畜，今年都进一步推广了。用这些良种配种的母畜今年比去年同期增多。黑龙江、辽宁、吉林等省用良种公畜配种的母畜，约占全部已配母畜的一半。吉林、河南、河北三省已建立配种站一万多处。河南已基本上实现了社社有配种站、队队有输精点。黑龙江、内蒙古等省区今春还大力推广了“一马配三千”的经验，不仅有力地推动春配工作，而且特别有利于良种繁殖。
