Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 9th – West Germany and the United States are crudely putting pressure on the Republic of Guinea regarding its establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic.

    The Bonn Press Office announced that the West German cabinet meeting today decided to issue an ultimatum to Guinea, coercing Guinea to issue a statement within two or three days denying the establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic. Otherwise, the West German government would sever diplomatic relations with Guinea. West German government spokesman Eckardt also announced today that the West German government delegation scheduled to go to Guinea has decided not to go. The West German government has also recalled its ambassador to Guinea.

    The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," which often reflects the views of the West German government, pointed out in an editorial today that the Bonn ruling clique is extremely alarmed by Guinea's recognition of the German Democratic Republic because they fear that Guinea's action will trigger a "chain reaction in other countries," thus becoming a "serious" problem.

    The United States government also hurried to join Bonn in putting pressure on Guinea. U.S. State Department spokesman Tally even said on the 7th that Guinea's recognition of the German Democratic Republic was a "serious disregard for the principle of self-determination." U.S. Ambassador to Guinea Morrow also received instructions from Washington to express "regret" to President Touré.

    几内亚承认德意志民主共和国
    西德和美国暴跳如雷
    据新华社波恩9日电　西德和美国就几内亚同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系一事对几内亚共和国粗暴地施加压力。
    波恩新闻局宣布，西德内阁会议今天已经决定向几内亚提出最后通牒，胁迫几内亚在两三天内发表声明否认同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系，否则，西德政府就要同几内亚断绝外交关系。西德政府发言人埃卡特今天还宣布，预定要到几内亚去的西德政府代表团已决定不去了。西德政府并且召回了驻几内亚大使。
    经常反映西德政府意见的“法兰克福汇报”今天在社论中指出，波恩统治集团所以对几内亚承认德意志民主共和国极为惊慌，是因为他们害怕几内亚这个行动会引起“其他国家的链锁反应”，因而成为“严重的”问题。
    美国政府也赶紧出来同波恩一起向几内亚施压力。美国国务院新闻发布官塔利7日竟说，几内亚承认德意志民主共和国是“严重地忽视自决原则的做法”。美国驻几内亚大使莫罗也接到华盛顿的指示，要他向杜尔总统表示“遗憾”。
