(Reported from Tianjin, March 12th) A new method adopted by the machinery industry departments of Hebei Province in supporting agricultural technical transformation involves establishing "experimental fields" in people's communes, summarizing the experience of agricultural tool reform, and improving the production of agricultural machinery. This approach closely integrates factory technicians with skilled craftsmen in rural areas, resulting in the manufacturing of a large number of new-style implements suitable for local farming conditions, accelerating the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agricultural production, and rapidly improving the industrial production and technical levels.

The specific method used by machinery factories in Hebei Province to "cultivate experimental fields" in rural areas is as follows: Each factory selects one or several production teams in a commune as a regularly contacted base. The factory, led by the Party Secretary or Director, forms specialized organizations such as a technical research committee and a new-style agricultural tool trial production team, comprised of engineering technicians and skilled workers. They regularly visit communes and production teams to consult with farmers, organize discussions to understand the needs of agricultural production, and determine the projects for new products. At the same time, they form technical groups with local skilled craftsmen to summarize the experience of rural tool reform, develop preliminary design schemes for new-style agricultural tools, submit them to the factory for design and manufacturing, and after successful trial production, send them to communes and production teams for on-site demonstrations and trials, soliciting the opinions of experienced farmers for repeated modifications until the farmers are satisfied. The factory then finalizes the design and puts them into mass production. From October of last year to now, in just over four months, the province has produced more than 300 types and over 17.75 million pieces of new-style agricultural implements. These include not only mechanized large-scale agricultural machinery such as automatic reed harvesters, universal feed crushers, tractor-drawn rolling, harrowing, leveling, and ridging machines, and low-pressure steam water wheels, but also semi-mechanized sets of high-efficiency implements for deep plowing, ridging, sowing, rice transplanting, inter-row cultivation and field management, transportation, and agricultural and sideline product processing.

After the agricultural machinery factories in various parts of Hebei "cultivated experimental fields" in rural areas, agricultural machinery production became closely integrated with rural tool reform, factory technical theory with rural production experience, and workers with experienced farmers. This allowed for the production of agricultural tools that are simple in structure, low in cost, highly efficient, and tailored to actual needs, in accordance with local conditions and seasonal requirements. After establishing a fixed contact system with more than 500 commune production teams, the 260-plus large, medium, and small-sized agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair factories in Tianjin, within four months, worked with farmers to research and trial-produce more than 100 types of mechanized and semi-mechanized new-style agricultural production and agricultural and sideline product processing implements, generally increasing production efficiency by several to dozens of times. When the Qizhou Agricultural Tool Factory in Anguo County held a forum with experienced farmers in its "experimental field"—the Qizhou Commune—the farmers pointed out: the entire commune's farmland had achieved advanced garden-style management, with each plot leveled like a mirror and the ridges as straight as a line, but this required too much labor. Workers Zhang Yuqing and Zheng Ruiyan from the factory systematically studied the characteristics of various land-leveling tools and created a tractor-drawn land-leveling combined machine that mechanized the five processes of rolling, harrowing, leveling, and ridging, leveling more than 300 mu of land per day and saving more than 700 laborers.

Through "cultivating experimental fields," Hebei Province's machinery industry has not only supported agriculture but also strengthened itself, raising the production technology level of the province's machinery industry to a new level. Many agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants and small agricultural tool factories in the province have improved their design capabilities by regularly going into the countryside to understand the needs of agricultural production and systematically summarize and study the experience of farmers' tool reforms. They have evolved from being able to manufacture only small agricultural tools such as hoe blades, waterwheels, and sickles to now being able to design and manufacture mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural machinery themselves. The Xingjiawan Agricultural Machinery Factory in Julu County, which used to have only 20 old belt-driven lathes and about 200 workers, could only produce simple agricultural tools such as iron shovels and hoe blades. In supporting agricultural technical transformation, the factory had no models or drawings to produce agricultural machinery, so the workers went deep into the countryside to summarize the experience of farmers' tool reforms. Lacking machine equipment, they made some simple machine tools themselves. Now, the factory has developed into an agricultural machinery factory with 52 technical equipment such as center lathes, universal milling machines, and gantry planers, and more than 470 workers. It can not only repair and assemble large agricultural machinery such as tractors but also design and manufacture 35 types of agricultural machinery on its own.

In industrial support for agriculture, the method of vigorously developing experimental fields has solidified the cooperative relationship between industry and agriculture. The relationship between workers and peasants has also been further consolidated and developed on the new foundation of agricultural technical transformation. Workers not only produce a large number of convenient and efficient agricultural implements for farmers, but also help farmers summarize their tool reform experience and impart new technologies. Farmers regard the factory as their own "arsenal" and actively help the factory solve production difficulties. In order to support the county's water conservancy efforts, workers at the Linmingtou Agricultural Machinery Factory in Yongnian County worked with well-drilling team farmers to develop a power-driven well-drilling machine that increased well-drilling efficiency by more than 12 times. The factory plans to manufacture 47 well-drilling machines to free the county's farmers from the heavy physical labor of manual well-drilling that had lasted for decades. However, they were short 500 meters of seamless steel pipe and could not mass-produce them immediately. Upon hearing this, the farmers delivered the old manual well-drilling hammers with seamless steel pipes that they had used in the past, solving the shortage of seamless steel pipes. As of early February, the factory had produced 23 well-drilling machines and sent them to the communes. Whenever a new type of agricultural implement is successfully trial-produced, workers at the mechanical factories in Baoding City directly deliver it to the "experimental field" with gongs and drums, handing it over to experienced farmers for trial use and evaluation. Farmers use the new implements to improve labor productivity and also go to the factory with gongs and drums to report their new production achievements to the veteran workers. In agricultural technical transformation, workers and farmers cooperate and support each other, greatly promoting the double leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    河北省贯彻工业支援农业方针的新形式
    机械厂在公社大办“试验田”
    本报天津12日电　河北省机械工业部门在支援农业技术改造中，采取各种方式，在人民公社中“种试验田”，总结农具改革的经验，改进农业机械的生产。采取这种办法，使工厂技术人员与农村的能工巧匠密切结合起来，制造出大批适合当地耕作条件的新式机具，加速了农业生产机械化半机械化，又迅速提高了工业的生产水平和技术水平。
    河北省各机械工厂在农村“种试验田”的具体作法是：每一个工厂都选择一个到几个公社的生产队作为经常联系挂钩的基点。工厂由党委书记或厂长亲自挂帅，吸取工程技术人员和技术工人组成技术研究委员会、新式农具试制小组等专业组织，定期深入到公社、生产队访问农民，组织座谈，了解农业生产需要，确定新制产品的项目。同时与当地能工巧匠共同组成技术小组，总结农村工具改革经验，订出新式农具的初步设计方案，上交工厂进行设计制造，试制成功后，再送到公社、生产队通过现场表演、试用，征求老农意见，反复修改，直到农民使用满意，工厂再最后定型成批投入生产。从去年10月到现在，四个多月时间，全省已生产出三百多种、一千七百五十多万件新式农业机具，其中不仅有机械化的自动割苇机、万能饲料粉碎机、机引轧、耙、平、整、筑畦联合机、低压蒸汽水车等大型的农业机械，还有半机械化的深耕、培埂、播种、插秧、中耕和田间管理、运输、农副产品加工等成套的高工效机具。
    河北各地农业机械工厂在农村“种试验田”以后，农业机械的生产与农村工具改革、工厂技术理论与农村生产经验、工人与老农紧密结合起来，从而因地制宜、因时制宜地生产出结构简单、成本低、效率高、切合实际需要的农具。天津市全市二百六十多个大中小型农业机械制造厂和农具制修厂，与五百多个公社生产队建立了固定的联系制度以后，四个月时间，和农民一道研究试制成一百多种机械化半机械化的新式农业生产、农副产品加工机具，生产效率一般的都提高几倍到几十倍。安国县祁州农具厂在“试验田”——祁州公社召开老农座谈会时，农民提出：全社耕地实现了高级园田化，每一块地都作到地平如镜，埂直如线，用劳动力太多。这个厂工人张玉庆、郑瑞烟二人系统地研究了各种平整土地的工具的特点，创造出一种机引平整土地联合机，使轧地、耙地、平整、筑畦等五道工序机械化，每天平整土地三百多亩，节约七百多名劳力。
    河北省机械工业通过“种试验田”，不仅支援了农业，而且也武装了自己，使全省机械工业的生产技术水平更上一层楼。这个省许多农业机械修配厂和小型农具厂，由于经常深入农村，从了解农业生产需要和系统的总结研究农民工具改革经验中，提高了设计水平，由原来只能制造锄板、水车、镰刀等小型农具，现在发展成能自己设计、制造机械化半机械化农业机械。巨鹿县邢家湾农业机械厂，过去全厂只有二十台“老掉牙”的旧皮带车床，二百来名工人，只能生产铁锨、锄板等简单农具。这个厂在支援农业技术改造中，生产农业机械没有样板、图纸，工人们就深入农村，总结农民工具改革的经验。没有机器设备，就自己制造一些简易机床。现在，这个厂已发展成为拥有五十二台元车、万能铣床、龙门刨床等技术设备，四百七十多名工人的农业机械厂，不仅能修配拖拉机等大型农业机械，而且自己还能设计制造三十五种农业机械。
    在工业支援农业中，采取大搞试验田的方法，使工业和农业的协作关系固定下来；工人和农民的关系，也在农业技术改造新的基础上，获得进一步巩固和发展。工人不仅为农民生产出大量的操作方便、效率又高的各种农业机具，而且还帮助农民总结工具改革经验，传授新技术，农民把工厂当作自己的“兵工厂”，主动地帮助工厂解决生产中的困难。永年县临洺头农机厂工人为了支援全县水利化，同打井队农民一道研究出一种动力打井机，打井效率提高十二倍多。这个厂计划制造四十七台打井机，使全县农民从几十年来人力打井的笨重体力劳动中解放出来。但是，缺五百米无缝钢管不能马上大批生产，农民听说后连夜将过去的五十套无缝钢管的旧人力打井锤送到工厂，解决了无缝钢管缺乏的困难。截至2月上旬，这个厂已生产出二十三台打井机，送往公社。保定市各机械厂每试制成功一种新式农业机具，工人们都是敲锣打鼓地直接送到“试验田”，交付老农试用鉴定。农民使用新机具，提高了劳动生产效率，也敲锣打鼓到工厂向老工人汇报生产新成就。工人、农民在农业技术改造中，互相协作支援，大大促进了工农业生产双跃进。
