　　The workers in the light textile industry of Nanjing are launching a vigorous revolutionary movement of comparing with famous brands, catching up with famous brands, and creating famous brands. Their slogan is "Modestly learn to compare with famous brands, work hard to catch up with famous brands, and dare to think and act to create famous brands." They also put forward "Compare with famous brands and learn modestly, catch up with famous brands with full confidence, and create famous brands with soaring enthusiasm." From these slogans, we can not only see their great ambitions, but also the working class's spirit of continuous revolution and absolute dissatisfaction.

　　The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory has been doing a very good job in this spirit of comparison, catching up, and creation. This factory was established in 1952. At the beginning, there was no machinery and equipment, and all production was manual. The leaders were all transferred from the army and were not experts in this field. They could only produce a few products such as washbasins and mugs. However, in the second half of 1956, only a few years after the establishment of the factory, the quality of the products reached the second place in the country, second only to the Shanghai Enamel Factory, which had more than 40 years of production history. In September 1957, the product quality was rated as the first in the country, catching up with the best famous brands. After less than a year, many technical indicators of product quality in terms of internal quality and appearance have reached the world's advanced level.

　　This spirit of comparing with famous brands, catching up with famous brands, and creating famous brands is actually the specific application of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development in technological innovation and technological revolution. Comparing, catching up, and creating are precisely three stages: comparison is the beginning, catching up is the process, and creation is the goal. The three stages are closely linked, one step is higher than the other, and walking will be more energetic step by step. With this idea of continuous revolution, new material and technical forces will be created, and new material and technical forces will in turn consolidate and enrich the idea of continuous revolution.

　　By comparing, we can know the level, distinguish between advanced and backward. To catch up with famous brands, we must first dare to compete, dare to compare with famous brands, and not be intimidated by the brand names of famous brands. The workers said it well, "See who has the most courage to compare with famous brands!" "See who dares to compare with the best famous brands!" What is a famous brand? It is the trademark of a good commodity. Comparing with famous brands means competing with the best things, which is a manifestation of not being willing to be inferior to others. Factories compare with factories, communes compare with communes, and poor teams compare with rich teams. You compare with me, I compare with you. Everyone compares, everything compares, and the atmosphere of large-scale comparison prevails throughout the country.

　　What if the comparison is not as good as others? Catch up! If you dare to compare, you must dare to catch up. If you fall behind, you must catch up quickly. To catch up, you must carefully study the strengths of others and your own weaknesses, and find out where the problem lies. Since it is a "famous brand", it always has something better than ordinary products, so we must strategically despise difficulties and tactically pay attention to difficulties. We must not only learn modestly, but also study diligently and work hard. Although catching up is after all advancing along the path that others have taken, there are teachers to learn from and methods to follow, and contradictions are easier to solve. However, this is also an important step. Taking this step will encourage the vigorous fighting spirit of the majority of workers to innovate technology and promote workers to have more confidence in their wisdom and strength.

　　After comparing and catching up, we are still not satisfied. What happens after catching up? Still without stopping, starting to create our own! What's so great about famous brands? It is nothing more than being created by new brands. They were not famous when they first came out. They only became famous and became famous brands because of their good quality. "Man proposes, God disposes", "If you work hard, you can do it too". As long as we "work hard", new brands can surpass old famous brands, and old famous brands can also catch up with new famous brands. Famous brands are created. Whoever is good is a famous brand, has credit, and is loved and used by people. Without technological innovation and revolution, new famous brands cannot be created. If old famous brands stop moving forward or slow down a little, they will be suppressed and replaced by new brands later. Haven't some famous brands in the past been forgotten? Creating famous brands requires solving more hidden and complex problems, and taking paths that others have not taken. It is difficult to discover and solve these problems without a lot of exploration. This requires the spirit of continuous revolution, and we must take the victories we have achieved as the starting point for striving for new victories.

　　What is the result of you chasing me, advancing side by side, constantly comparing, constantly catching up, and constantly creating? Production has developed and socialist construction has advanced by leaps and bounds. The history of production development is the history of producers constantly carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution and improving labor productivity in practice. The spirit of comparing, catching up, and creating famous brands is a driving force for promoting productivity improvement and continuous revolution.

    比·赶·创
    顾明
    南京市轻纺工业职工，正在轰轰烈烈地展开一个比名牌、赶名牌、创名牌的革命运动，他们的口号是“虚心学习比名牌、鼓足干劲赶名牌，敢想敢为创名牌”，又提出“比名牌虚心学习，赶名牌信心百倍，创名牌干劲冲天”。从这些口号里不仅可以看出他们的雄心大志，也可看出我们工人阶级的不断革命和绝不满足的豪迈精神。
    这种比、赶、创的精神，西安人民搪瓷厂早就做得很好。这个厂是1952年建立的，初办时没有什么机器设备，生产全是手工操作，领导人全是从部队转业的外行，只能产面盆、口杯几种产品。可是在1956年后半年，建厂仅仅几年时间，产品质量就达到全国第二，仅次于已经有四十多年生产历史的上海搪瓷厂，1957年9月，产品质量被评为全国第一，赶上了最好的名牌货。又经过不到一年的时间在产品质量的内质和外观上的许多技术指标，已达到了世界先进水平。
    这种比名牌、赶名牌、创名牌的精神，实际就是毛泽东同志不断革命和革命发展阶段论的理论在技术革新和技术革命中的具体运用。比、赶、创，这正是三个阶段：比较是开始，追赶是过程，创造才是目的。三个阶段一步紧接着一步，一步比一步更高，走起来也会一步比一步更有劲。有这种不断革命的思想，就会创造新的物质技术力量，新的物质技术力量，反过来又巩固和丰富了不断革命的思想。
    比了可以知高低，分先进后进，要赶名牌货，首先就要敢于较量，敢于和名牌比，不为名牌货的牌子吓住。工人们说得好，“看谁比名牌最有勇气！”“看谁最敢和最好的名牌比高低！”名牌是什么？它就是好商品的商标，和名牌比这就是说要和最好的东西较量一番，是不甘居人下的表现。厂和厂比，公社和公社比，还有穷队和富队比，你比我，我比你。人人比，事事比，大比特比的风气盛行全国。
    比了不如人怎么办？赶！既敢比就一定敢赶。落后了就要急起直追，赶就要认真研究别人的长处和自己的弱点，找出问题的所在。既然是“名牌货”，它总有比一般产品高明的地方，因此就要战略上蔑视困难，在战术上重视困难，既要虚心学习，又要刻苦钻研，踏踏实实地干。虽然赶毕竟是沿着别人走过的道路前进，是有师可学有法可效的，矛盾比较容易解决。不过这也是重要的一步，走了这步，就会鼓舞广大工人革新技术的旺盛斗志，促使工人更加相信自己的智慧和力量。
    比了，赶了，还不满足。赶上之后又如何？仍然马不停蹄，人不下鞍开始自己创造！名牌有什么了不起呢？无非也是由新牌子创起来的，一出来也并不是就有名的，只是由于质量好才有了名成为名牌货。“事在人为”，“有为者，亦若是”。只要“有为”，新牌可以胜过老的名牌，老的名牌也可再赶上新的名牌。名牌是创出来的，谁好谁就是名牌，就有信用，为人喜买乐用。在技术上不革新、不革命，新的名牌是创不出的，老的名牌停步不前或稍一走慢，也会被后来的新牌子压下去，取而代之，过去一些名牌货不是已经被人忘了吗？创名牌要解决更隐蔽更复杂的问题，走别人所没走过的道路，不下一番探求的工夫是很难发现和解决的。这就要有不断革命的精神，要把已经取得的胜利做为争取新的胜利的起点。
    你追我赶、并肩前进、不断地比、不断地赶、不断地创造的结果是什么呢？生产发展了，社会主义建设突飞猛进了。一部生产发展的历史，就是生产者自己在实践中，不断进行技术革新和技术革命、提高劳动生产率的历史。比名牌、赶名牌、创名牌的比、赶、创的精神，就是推动生产率提高，不断革命的一种动力。
