On March 14th, in the square of Mangshi, the capital of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, more than 10,000 people from various ethnic groups in the border area held a grand gathering with Burmese friends to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement. This was another grand gathering of border people following the Sino-Burmese border people's carnival held here in December 1956, attended by the prime ministers of both countries. On this auspicious day of historical significance for the development of friendly relations between China and Myanmar, people naturally recalled the traditional and profound friendship between the border people of the two countries. On the border, stories embodying this friendship are like the trees on Gaoligong Mountain and the sand grains in the Ruili River—truly endless and inexhaustible.

Chinese Godmother

In the Ruili County area of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the borders between Chinese and Burmese people are intertwined. One winter morning last year, a Burmese peasant woman from Mangxiu Village, Mai Hanrui, carried her sick daughter from Shunha Village in Ruili County, China, to Namhkam in Myanmar for medical treatment. While walking on the road in Shunha, her daughter cried violently for a while and then suddenly stopped. The mother immediately stopped and sat under a large banyan tree by the roadside to breastfeed her child. However, the child wouldn't eat, and her breathing gradually weakened. Seeing her beloved daughter dying, the mother cried anxiously. Fortunately, Bao Jianfen, a health worker from the Shunha Township Health Station in Ruili County, happened to pass by and discovered them. Bao Jianfen immediately led the young mother to the health station and gave the sick child emergency treatment, including injections, medication, and artificial respiration. After half an hour, the little girl cried "wah wah." The mother took the child from the health worker's hand, and the child ate when breastfed. She immediately turned from tears to laughter, repeatedly saying to Bao Jianfen with excitement: "Good sister, thank you! Without you, my child would have been dead." As she spoke, she took out several kyats and handed them to Bao Jianfen, insisting that she accept them. Bao Jianfen firmly refused, and the mother said that she was a passing foreigner. Upon hearing this explanation, Bao Jianfen quickly said to her: "Whether you are Chinese or Burmese, we are all relatives; how could we stand by and watch someone die?" Bao Jianfen not only didn't take her money but also gave her a packet of medicine, telling her to take it over three days, and the child's illness might be cured. The mother took the medicine, shedding tears of gratitude. She recognized Bao Jianfen as her daughter's godmother, and before leaving, she said, "When my child grows up, I will definitely bring her to visit her Chinese godmother!"

Friendship Ferry

The Ruili River, like a silver ribbon, flows winding through the Ruili Dam. The Dai border people of China and Myanmar live in the depths of the bamboo forests on both sides of the river, with the sounds of chickens and dogs audible between the villages. The border people of the two countries get along amicably, as close as family, and have forged close friendships through their comings and goings on the ferry.

In Jiele Township, Ruili, there is a Hefe Ferry. This ferry is a vital passage between Muse in Myanmar and Ruili in China. Since ancient times, this ferry has been jointly operated by representatives from Mangxiu Village in Myanmar and Hefe Village in Ruili, China, who are dispatched by their respective villages. The ferry management personnel of the two countries jointly serve the travelers of both countries, living in the same house, eating at the same table, singing the same song of peace, and being as close as brothers and sisters. Their love and cooperation ensure the smooth operation of the Hefe Ferry and promote economic and cultural exchanges between the border people of the two countries. Therefore, this ferry has become a bridge connecting the friendship between the two countries, and some people call it the "Friendship Ferry."

Unity Water

In 1958, like the rest of the country, Ruili County in the frontier of the motherland also launched a vigorous upsurge in water conservancy construction. The famous Unity Canal was completed during the Great Leap Forward. This eighteen-kilometer-long canal diverted water from the Ruili River to irrigate more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields, realizing the sixty-year wish of the people of all ethnic groups in Ruili. The spring plowing season was advanced, cultivation techniques were improved, and bumper harvests were achieved year after year.

After the Unity Canal was extended to Hesai Township, rice seedlings could be planted even when it didn't rain, resulting in increased production year after year. Manghuangdong, a Burmese village near Hesai Township, was very happy and envious to see that we could ensure a good harvest even without rain by building the Unity Canal. So they also learned from the farmers of Hesai, plowing and sowing early, and improving their techniques. However, Manghuangdong lacked water. They sent representatives to visit relatives and asked for help. The commune members of Hesai Township, knowing this, readily agreed to share some water with their neighbors, who were overjoyed. Last year, the farmers of Manghuangdong used this unity water to achieve increased production. Every time they saw this water, they were reminded of the help they received from the farmers of Hesai and the friendship between the border people of the two countries.

The border people of China and Myanmar faithfully follow the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the prime ministers of the two countries, helping each other and uniting closely, making the border between the two countries a peaceful and friendly border.

    和平友好的边境
    新华社记者　郗保常　黄昌禄
    3月14日，在云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州首府芒市的广场上，边境各族人民一万多人举行盛大集会，同缅甸朋友一起欢庆中缅友好和互不侵犯条约、中缅两国边界问题协定的签订。这是继1956年12月在这里举行的有两国总理参加的中缅边民联欢会后，边境各族人民的又一次盛会。在这个对中缅两国友好关系的发展具有历史意义的喜庆日子里，人们自然地联想起两国边境人民之间的传统深厚友谊。在边境上，凝结着这种友谊的故事有如高黎贡山上的树木，有如瑞丽江中的沙粒，真是说不完，写不尽。
    中国干妈妈
    在德宏傣族景颇族自治州的瑞丽县一带，中缅两国边民林连林、田连田。去年冬天的一个早晨，缅甸芒修寨的农妇买喊瑞背着生病的女儿，从我国瑞丽县顺哈寨绕道到缅甸南坎给女儿看病。正走在顺哈的路上，她的女儿猛哭了一阵后，突然不哭了。这位母亲立刻停下来，坐到路边的一棵大青树下给孩子喂奶。可是，孩子不吃了，呼吸也慢慢微弱下去。母亲眼看自己心爱的女儿快死了，急得直哭。正在无法可想的时候，幸好被路过这里的瑞丽县顺哈乡卫生站的卫生员包建芬发现了，包建芬立即领着这位年轻的母亲到卫生站，对病孩进行急救，打针、喂药，同时进行人工呼吸。过了半小时，小女孩“哇哇”地哭了。这位母亲从卫生员手中接过小孩，喂奶也吃了，她马上破涕为笑，激动得不断地对包建芬说：“好姐姐，谢谢你！没有你，我的小孩是没命了。”说着她便拿出几元缅币递给包建芬，一定要她收下。包建芬坚决不收，这位母亲说，她是外国人路过的。包建芬听到这一解释，连忙对她说：“不管是中国人还是缅甸人，大家都是亲戚嘛，那能见死不救呢？”包建芬不但没有收她的钱，还包了一包药给她，告诉她这包药分做三天吃完，孩子的病就可能好了。这位母亲收下药后，感激得流泪，她代替女儿认下包建芬做干妈，临走时还说：“孩子长大了，我一定要领她来看望中国的干妈妈！”
    友谊的渡口
    瑞丽江像一条银色的带子，弯弯曲曲地流过瑞丽坝子中间。中缅两国的傣族边民住在江两岸的竹林深处，村寨之间鸡犬相闻。两国边民友好相处，亲如一家，在往来过渡中，更结下了亲密的友谊。
  在瑞丽的姐勒乡，有一个合肥渡口。这个渡口是缅甸的木姐同我国瑞丽两个城镇之间往来的要道。自古以来，这个渡口就是由江对岸缅甸的芒修村和我国瑞丽的合肥村互派代表，合作经营。两国的渡口管理人员，共同为往来的两国旅客服务，他们同住在一间房子，同桌子吃饭，同唱一支和平歌，亲如手足。他们之间的友爱和合作，保证了合肥渡口的畅通，促进了两国边民经济、文化的交流。于是这个渡口成了联系两国友谊的桥梁，因此有人叫它作“友谊的渡口”。
    团结水
    1958年，祖国边疆瑞丽县也和全国一样，掀起了轰轰烈烈的水利建设高潮。著名的团结大沟在跃进高潮中修通了，这十八公里长的水沟，把瑞丽江里的水引出灌溉了四万多亩水田，实现了瑞丽各族人民六十年来的愿望，春耕季节提早了，耕作技术也改进了，连年都获得了大丰收。
    当团结大沟修到贺赛乡以后，这里天不下雨，也能把秧栽下，连年增产。靠近贺赛乡的缅甸村寨叫芒晃东，看见我们修了团结大沟，无雨也能保丰收，很为我们高兴，又很羡慕。于是他们也学着贺赛农民的样子，早犁田，早撒秧，提高技术。可是，芒晃东这地方的水很缺少。他们就派代表来串亲戚，要求给予帮助。贺赛乡的社员知道后，就慨然答应把水分一部分给邻居，邻居们真是高兴万分。去年，芒晃东农民利用这股团结水，获得了增产。他们一看见这股水，就想起贺赛农民对他们的帮助，就想起了两国边民的友谊。
    中缅两国边境人民就是这样忠实地遵循着两国总理倡导的和平共处五项原则，互相帮助，亲密团结，使两国的边境成为和平友好的边境。
