Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 25th: "Lao Patriotic News" pointed out that since the US imperialists and their lackeys launched the civil war, the Lao people's heroic anti-American patriotic struggle has achieved great victories and formed an increasingly powerful struggle movement of the entire nation.

The newspaper said in a commentary published on March 12 that in the past seven months, the Laotian combat forces and people's armed forces have heroically resisted the continuous "sweeps" carried out by the Royal Army equipped with US weapons, and have annihilated, captured, and won over more than 3,000 people from the Royal Army, seizing more than 800 various weapons.

The commentary pointed out that while carrying out the anti-"sweep" struggle, the Lao people have also carried out the struggle to safeguard the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. To date, hundreds of thousands of Lao people have held rallies demanding that the Royal Government stop the civil war, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, oppose the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" ringleaders launching a coup and dissolving the National Assembly, and demand the protection of the people's democratic rights, freedoms, and peaceful lives.

The commentary said that in February, 31,956 people in various places wrote petitions to the King. People in Vientiane, including staff, military police personnel, and monks, distributed thousands of leaflets and carried out the above-mentioned struggles through thousands of petitions.

The commentary emphasized that the American interventionists and their lackeys cannot suppress the entire Lao nation, which has a tradition of heroic and unyielding struggle and defeating foreign aggressors.

    老挝人民决不向干涉者低头  反美救国斗争声势日益浩大
    新华社河内25日电　“老挝爱国新闻”指出，自从美帝国主义及其走狗发动内战以来，老挝人民进行英勇的反美救国斗争已经获得了巨大胜利，并形成了整个民族的日益强大的斗争运动。
    这家报纸在3月12日发表的一篇评论中说，过去七个月中，寮国战斗部队和人民武装力量英勇地抗击了用美国武器装备起来的王国军队所进行的连续“扫荡”，并且歼灭、俘掳和招降了王国军队中三千多人，缴获了八百多件各类武器。
    评论指出，老挝人民一方面进行反“扫荡”斗争，一方面进行了维护日内瓦协议和万象协议的斗争。到目前为止，已有数十万老挝人民举行集会，要求王国政府停止内战，恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由，反对“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们发动政变和解散国会，要求保障人民的民主、自由权利和安宁生活。
    评论说，2月间，各地就有三万一千九百五十六人写建议书给国王。万象人民其中包括职员、军警人员和僧侣散发了成千张传单和通过成千份建议书进行上述斗争。
    评论强调指出，美国干涉者和它的走狗，镇压不了具有英勇不屈地斗争和战胜外来侵略者的传统的老挝全民族。
