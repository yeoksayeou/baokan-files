Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: The full text of the speech by Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital in support of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference Day, is as follows:
Comrades, friends:
The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will be held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, from April 11th to 15th. At this conference, representatives of the people of Asian and African countries and regions will exchange views on major issues such as strengthening the unity of the Asian and African people and opposing imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity will also send a delegation to participate in the conference. We believe that the holding of the conference will further develop and consolidate the friendly unity of the Asian and African people in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and further encourage and promote the victorious advance of the African national independence movement. This not only conforms to the strong aspirations of the 1.7 billion Asian and African people, but also conforms to the common interests of the people of the world in opposing imperialist aggression and maintaining world peace. The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the convening of this conference and sincerely wish the conference a success.
We are pleased to see that since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo in early 1958, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Movement has developed significantly, and the struggles of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism and for national independence have continued to rise and have achieved greater and greater victories.
	The struggle of the Asian people to win and safeguard national independence
	has dealt a severe blow to imperialist aggression.
In Asia, the Iraqi people used the flames of national revolution to break the chains of the Baghdad Pact, severely打击[dǎ jī: strike; hit] the imperialist aggression in the Middle East. With the firm support of peace-loving countries and people around the world, the Lebanese people defeated the Anglo-American imperialist armed aggression. The people of Oman and South Yemen have also launched tenacious struggles against British imperialism. Through mass movements that are larger and more powerful than ever before, the Japanese people have unyieldingly launched struggles against the Japan-U.S. military alliance and against the revival of Japanese militarism, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist plot to foster Japanese militarist forces and plot new wars in the Far East.
	The people of all regions of Africa have generally awakened, and
	the torrent of national revolution is surging forward irresistibly.
In the past two years, the face of Africa has undergone tremendous changes. The African people have generally awakened, and the flames of national revolution have spread throughout the African continent. In particular, the successive holding of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the All-African People's Conference, and the Conference of Independent African States has greatly encouraged the will of the African people to fight for independence and freedom. New independent countries are emerging one after another. Currently, ten countries out of the fifty-nine countries and regions in Africa have achieved independence, and four more countries—Congo, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria—will declare independence this year. The people of some countries that have already achieved independence are still waging persistent struggles to abolish foreign military bases, withdraw foreign troops, and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The heroic Algerian people, in their long-term armed struggle against French colonialists, have become stronger in battle, dealing heavy blows to the French aggressors and setting a glorious example for the cause of liberation of the African people. The Cameroonian people are also waging a tenacious struggle to demand the withdrawal of French aggressor troops and the realization of the complete independence of their motherland. At present, the people of Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, Somaliland, Zanzibar, and other places are carrying out various forms of anti-colonialist struggles for national independence. The South African people's struggle against racial discrimination is also becoming increasingly widespread and intense. In many regions of Angola, a widespread struggle against Portuguese colonialism has been launched. Now, the struggles for liberation in various regions and among various nationalities of Africa have converged into a torrent of national revolution, surging forward irresistibly, greatly shaking the decaying colonial system of imperialism, and becoming an important component of the world's people's struggle against imperialism and for the defense of peace. 1960 will be a year of continued upsurge in the African national independence movement. We express our firm support to our African brothers standing at the forefront of the anti-colonialist struggle, and we wish them continued new victories in this struggle.
	The new aggression and new conspiracies of the United States in Asia
	cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the people of Asian countries.
A series of major victories achieved by the Asian and African people in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence have dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist forces of war. At present, colonialism and imperialism, in order to wage a dying struggle and carry out new aggression, are fabricating new conspiracies. On January 19th of this year, the United States, in collusion with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, signed a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," making Japan a U.S. nuclear war base and a source of serious war danger. The United States not only continues to赖在[lài zài: hang around; be unwilling to leave] South Korea and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also openly launched a "Matador" missile at Osan, South Korea, on February 26th, carrying out new provocations against peace in Korea and the Far East. In Indochina, the United States has consistently obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, intensified war preparations in South Vietnam, conspired to expand the Lao civil war, and incited its followers to undermine the Geneva Accords. In the Middle East, the United States is using the Central Treaty Organization and Israel to intensify military threats and subversive activities against Arab countries. The United States still霸占[bà zhàn: forcibly occupy; seize] our territory of Taiwan, constantly侵犯[qīnfàn: intrude on; infringe on] our territorial waters and airspace, and recently conducted large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These actions by the United States seriously threaten peace and security in Asia and cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the people of Asian countries.
	U.S. imperialism is infiltrating the African continent from all sides, and
	it is the most dangerous enemy of Africa's struggle for independence.
In Africa, imperialist colonial forces are not reconciled to their defeat. When they realize that barbaric suppression alone cannot stop the African people's liberation struggle, they retreat in order to advance, making certain concessions in form in an attempt to disintegrate the African people's struggle, split the African people's unity, so as to continue to maintain their crumbling colonial rule in this region. Of particular note is that while actively supporting the bloody suppression of the African people by the old colonial powers, U.S. imperialism, on the other hand, is using the guise of "sympathizing" with African independence, using the provision of "aid" as a pretext, to infiltrate the African continent from all sides, attempting to replace the position of the old colonialists. People can clearly see that it is U.S. imperialism that is acting as an accomplice to the French colonialists in slaughtering the people of Algeria and Cameroon; it is U.S. imperialism that is using its air force bases in Africa to help Belgium transport colonial troops to suppress the Congolese people. The United States also maintains military bases in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Ethiopia, Congo, and Liberia, and stations armed forces in many parts of Africa. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is a new but also the most dangerous enemy of Africa's struggle for independence. No matter how eloquently U.S. imperialism speaks, the essence of its neo-colonialism is being seen through by more and more African people. In the face of the African people's powerful struggle, neither neo-colonialism nor old colonialism can escape the fate of failure.
	Asian-African unity is the fundamental guarantee for the liberation of the Asian and African people.
	The spirit of the Five Principles is increasingly showing its great vitality.
In order to smash the new conspiracies of imperialism, the Asian and African people must further strengthen their unity. Asian-African unity is the fundamental guarantee for the liberation of the Asian and African people. The Bandung Conference five years ago laid the foundation for Asian-African unity. Since then, the national independence movements of the two continents of Asia and Africa have been linked together, promoting and influencing each other, and developing wave after wave. Therefore, imperialism is very hostile to Asian-African unity. They sow discord everywhere, spread disharmony, and try every means to undermine this unity. The purpose of their doing so is to divert the target of the Asian and African people's struggle, isolate the Asian and African countries from each other, and lose mutual support, so that they can be defeated one by one. The more imperialism tries to undermine Asian-African unity, the more the Asian and African people realize the value of Asian-African unity and strive to maintain this unity. The tortuous development of the past year shows that Asian-African unity can withstand tests and cannot be undermined by any force. Among Asian and African countries, as long as everyone adopts an attitude of friendly mutual concessions and adheres to the method of peaceful consultation, there is no problem that cannot be resolved fairly and reasonably. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, not only are not, as some people say, "outdated" or "withered," on the contrary, the spirit of the Five Principles shows its great vitality more and more with the passage of time. The people of Asian and African countries must always recognize our common enemies, clarify our goals of struggle, spare no effort to consolidate and develop our great unity, and push the cause of liberation of the Asian and African people to a higher stage. This is where the fundamental interests of the Asian and African people lie.
	The Chinese people have a common task with the Asian and African people.
	We unite, sympathize with and support each other.
Comrades and friends, the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries have long suffered from imperialist and colonialist aggression and oppression. The Chinese people and the Asian and African people face the task of opposing imperialism, defending world peace, and developing their national economies. This common experience and task naturally unite us, sympathize with each other, and support each other. In the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese people have received the sympathy and support of the people of Asian and African countries. The Chinese people have also consistently regarded supporting the liberation struggle of all oppressed nations as their lofty international duty. Whenever imperialism carries out aggression in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, we firmly support the people there in repelling the aggressors. In the past two years, we have launched large-scale mass actions to support the Iraqi and Lebanese people's struggle against U.S. and British imperialist aggression and interference, the Congolese people's struggle against Belgian colonial rule, and the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance. We have also held "Algeria Week," "Cameroon Day," "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," "Africa Freedom Day," "Kenya Day," "Uganda Day," and many other activities to support the African people's struggle for independence and freedom. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Asian and African people as their own struggle, and feel infinitely excited about every victory they achieve. In the struggle against imperialism and for the defense of peace, the Chinese people will always stand with the Asian and African people!
At present, the international situation is very favorable to the struggle of the Asian and African people for winning and safeguarding national independence. With the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace and progressive forces of the world, the just cause of the Asian and African people will surely achieve greater victories.
Our era is an era in which Asia, Africa, Latin America and all the oppressed people of the world are striving for complete liberation, and it is an era in which imperialism and colonialism are heading for complete failure. The Asian and African people unite, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America unite, the people of the world unite, and advance courageously towards our common great goal!
Long live world peace!

    中国人民把亚非人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争
    廖承志在首都人民支持亚非人民团结大会日大会上的讲话
    新华社24日讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在首都各界人民支持第二届亚非人民团结大会日大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们、朋友们：
    第二届亚非人民团结大会将要在4月11日至15日在几内亚首都科纳克里召开。在这次大会上，亚非各国和各地区人民的代表将就加强亚非人民团结，反对帝国主义、殖民主义等重大问题交换意见。中国亚非团结委员会并将派一个代表团去参加大会。我们相信，大会的举行，必将进一步发展和巩固亚非人民在反对帝国主义、殖民主义的共同斗争中的友好团结，进一步鼓舞和推动非洲民族独立运动的胜利前进。这不仅符合十七亿亚非人民的强烈愿望，同时也符合全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的共同利益。中国人民热烈欢迎和支持这次大会的召开，衷心预祝这次大会的成功。
    我们高兴地看到，自从1958年初在开罗举行的第一届亚非人民团结大会以来，亚非人民团结运动有了显著的发展，亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，不断高涨，并且取得了越来越大的胜利。
    亚洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争
    给帝国主义的侵略活动以严重的打击
    在亚洲，伊拉克人民用民族革命的烈火烧断了巴格达条约的锁链，严重地打击了帝国主义在中近东的侵略活动。黎巴嫩人民在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决支持下，使英美帝国主义的武装侵略遭到了可耻的失败。阿曼人民和也门南部人民也掀起了反对英帝国主义的顽强斗争。日本人民通过一次比一次声势浩大的全民性运动，不屈不挠地展开了反对日美军事同盟、反对复活日本军国主义的斗争，对美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义势力在远东策划新战争的阴谋给了沉重的打击。
    非洲各地区人民已经普遍觉醒起来
    民族革命的洪流汹涌澎湃势不可当
    两年来，非洲的面貌已经发生了巨大的变化，非洲人民已经普遍觉醒起来，民族革命的烈火燃遍了整个非洲大陆。特别是亚非人民团结大会、全非人民大会和非洲独立国家会议的先后举行，大大鼓舞了非洲人民为独立自由而斗争的意志。新的独立国家一个接着一个地诞生。现在，在非洲五十九个国家和地区中已经有十个国家取得了独立，今年，还将有四个国家——刚果、索马里兰、多哥和尼日利亚——宣布独立。一些已经取得了独立的国家的人民还在为取消外国军事基地、撤退外国军队，维护国家主权和领土完整进行着坚持不懈的斗争。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在长期反对法国殖民者的武装斗争中，越战越强，给予法国侵略者以沉重的打击，并且为非洲人民的解放事业树立了一个光辉的榜样。喀麦隆人民也正在为要求撤退法国侵略军、实现祖国的完全独立进行着顽强的斗争。目前，尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚、坦噶尼喀、乌干达、怯尼亚、刚果、卢安达—乌隆迪、索马里兰、桑给巴尔等地的人民都在开展着各种形式的反殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。南非人民反抗种族歧视的斗争也日趋广泛和强烈。在安哥拉的许多地区，普遍地掀起了反对葡萄牙殖民主义者的斗争。现在，非洲各个地区、各个民族争取解放的斗争，已经汇合成为一股民族革命的洪流，汹涌澎湃，势不可当，大大动摇了帝国主义腐朽的殖民体系，成为全世界人民反对帝国主义、维护和平的斗争的重要组成部分。1960年将是非洲民族独立运动继续高涨的一年，我们向站在反对殖民主义前列的非洲弟兄们表示我们坚决的支持，并且预祝他们在这一斗争中不断取得新的胜利。
    美国在亚洲进行新的侵略和新的阴谋
    不能不引起亚洲各国人民高度的警惕
    亚非人民在反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争中所取得的一系列重大胜利，给予帝国主义战争势力以沉重的打击。目前，殖民主义和帝国主义为了进行垂死的挣扎和进行新的侵略，正在制造新阴谋。今年1月19日，美国同日本岸信介政府相勾结，签订了新的日美“安全条约”，使日本成为美国的核战争基地，和严重战争危险的策源地。美国不但至今仍赖在南朝鲜不走，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并且公然于2月26日在南朝鲜乌山发射“斗牛士”式导弹，对朝鲜和远东地区的和平进行新的挑衅。在印度支那，美国一贯阻挠越南的和平统一，加紧在南越的备战活动，阴谋扩大老挝内战，并且唆使它的追随者破坏日内瓦协议。在中近东，美国正在利用中央条约组织和以色列，加紧对阿拉伯国家进行军事威胁和颠覆活动。美国至今还霸占着我国的领土台湾，不断地侵犯我国的领海领空，最近更同蒋介石集团在台湾海峡举行了大规模的军事演习。美国的这些行动严重地威胁着亚洲的和平和安全，不能不引起亚洲各国人民高度的警惕。
    美帝国主义从各方面渗入非洲大陆
    它是非洲争取独立的最危险的敌人
    在非洲，帝国主义殖民势力并不甘心它们的失败。当它们发现单靠野蛮的镇压手段已经无法阻止非洲人民的解放斗争的时候，它们便以退为进，在形式上做出某些让步，企图瓦解非洲人民的斗争，分裂非洲人民的团结，以便继续维持它们在这一地区摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。特别值得注意的是，美帝国主义一方面在积极支援老牌殖民国家对非洲人民的血腥镇压，而另一方面却打着“同情”非洲独立的幌子，以提供“援助”为名，从各方面渗入非洲大陆，企图代替老牌殖民主义者的地位。人们可以清楚地看到，正是美帝国主义在充当法国殖民主义者屠杀阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆人民的帮凶；正是美帝国主义利用它在非洲的空军基地帮助比利时运送殖民军队去镇压刚果人民。美国还在摩洛哥、突尼斯、利比亚、埃塞俄比亚、刚果、利比里亚保有军事基地，在非洲许多地方驻扎着武装部队。这一切都说明，美国帝国主义是非洲争取独立的一个新的但也是最危险的敌人，不管美帝国主义怎样花言巧语，它的新殖民主义的本质正在被愈来愈多的非洲人民所看穿。在非洲人民的强大斗争面前，新殖民主义也好，老殖民主义也好，都同样逃脱不了失败的命运。
    亚非团结是亚非人民解放的根本保证
    五项原则精神日益显示伟大的生命力
    为了粉碎帝国主义的新阴谋，亚非人民必须进一步加强团结。亚非团结是亚非人民争取解放的根本保证。五年前的万隆会议奠定了亚非团结的基础。从此，亚非两大洲的民族独立运动联成了一气，互相推动，互相影响，一浪盖过一浪地向前发展。因此，帝国主义十分仇视亚非团结，它们到处挑拨离间，散布不和，千方百计地企图破坏这种团结。它们这样做的目的是要转移亚非人民的斗争目标，使亚非国家彼此孤立起来，失去相互支持，以便于它们各个击破。帝国主义越是要破坏亚非团结，就越使得亚非人民认识亚非团结的可贵，并且努力去维护这种团结。过去一年的曲折发展，说明亚非团结是经得起考验的，是任何力量都破坏不了的。在亚非国家间，只要大家采取友好互让的态度，坚持和平协商的方法，就没有什么问题不可以得到公平合理的解决。和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，不仅不像某些人所说的已经“过时”或者已经“枯萎”了，相反地，五项原则的精神随着时间的推移，却更加显示出它伟大的生命力。亚非各国人民必须永远认准我们的共同敌人，明确我们的斗争目标，不遗余力地巩固和发展我们的伟大团结，把亚非人民的解放事业推向一个更高的阶段，这是亚非人民的根本利益所在。
    中国人民同亚非人民有共同任务
    我们团结一致互相同情互相支援
    同志们，朋友们，中国人民同亚非各国人民都曾长期遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫。中国人民同亚非人民都面临着反对帝国主义维护世界和平和发展本国经济的任务。这种共同的经历和任务，使我们很自然地团结在一起，互相同情，互相支援。中国人民在反对美帝国主义侵略，维护主权和领土完整的斗争中，得到了亚非各国人民的同情和支持，中国人民也一贯把支持一切被压迫民族的解放斗争视为自己崇高的国际义务，每当帝国主义在亚非和世界其他地区进行侵略的时候，我们都坚决地支持那里的人民回击侵略者。两年来，我们曾经发动过大规模的群众行动，支持伊拉克、黎巴嫩人民反对美英帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争，支持刚果人民反对比利时殖民统治的斗争，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争。我们还举行了“阿尔及利亚周”、“喀麦隆日”、“帝国主义滚出非洲日”、“非洲自由日”、“怯尼亚日”、“乌干达日”和其他许许多多的活动来支持非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争。中国人民从来都把亚非人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，对于他们的每一个胜利都感到无限的兴奋。在反对帝国主义、维护和平的斗争中，中国人民将永远同亚非人民站在一起！
    目前，国际形势十分有利于亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界和平、进步力量的支持下，亚非人民的正义事业一定会取得更大的胜利。
    我们的时代是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切被压迫人民争取彻底解放的时代，是帝国主义和殖民主义走向彻底失败的时代。亚非人民团结起来，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，朝着我们共同的伟大目标奋勇前进！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
