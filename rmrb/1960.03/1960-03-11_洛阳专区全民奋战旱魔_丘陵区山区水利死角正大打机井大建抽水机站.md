    Luoyang Special Zone's People Fight Against the Drought Demon
    In Hilly and Mountainous Areas, Water Conservancy Dead Ends Are Being Targeted with Vigorous Well Drilling and Construction of Pumping Stations
    Factories and Mines Dispatch Workers, Deploy Power Machinery, and Vigorously Support Drought Resistance
    Editor's Note: In leading the broad masses in the fight against drought, the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee has done a good job of carefully analyzing the local situation, conducting water conservancy deployments, and taking different measures for different regions. In particular, actively surveying and planning, vigorously building pumping stations, and vigorously drilling wells in mountainous and hilly areas with poor water conservancy conditions are measures for fundamentally defeating drought and realizing water conservancy in mountainous areas. At the same time, the rapid mobilization and organization by the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee of various factories and mines to enthusiastically and actively support the fight against drought is a guarantee for closely combining workers and peasants, cities and villages, to overcome drought and win a bumper wheat harvest.
    (Reported by our newspaper) A mass movement climax of drought resistance for watering wheat and spring sowing has formed in Luoyang Special Zone, Henan. Since last winter, there has been a rare shortage of rain and snow in western Henan, and rainfall in March, April, and May is still low. The Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee fully estimated this serious situation, believing that it is necessary to concentrate all forces to overcome the drought. Currently, from cities to villages, from factories and mines to government offices and schools, everyone is taking comprehensive action. Nine work groups led by the First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee have rushed to the front lines of drought resistance; the county party committees have drawn more than 30,000 people to invest in the fight against drought; factories and mines are rushing to manufacture water conservancy machinery, and dispatching technicians to drought resistance construction sites to repair machinery and impart technology; financial and trade, cultural and educational, and health departments have also made plans to resolutely serve drought resistance.
    Since the Luoyang Special Zone's drought resistance for watering wheat began at the end of January, great achievements have been made. In the entire area of 2.5 million mu with self-flowing irrigation facilities, watering has been carried out once, and in some areas twice, with very good watering quality. The current mass drought resistance movement is developing in three directions: (1) In areas where water conservancy has already been realized, namely the plains along the Ru, Yi, Luo, and Jian Rivers, in order to thoroughly overcome the drought, wells are being vigorously drilled to implement a double insurance of wells and canals. For example, the Yanshi County Party Committee decided that before the end of March, one thousand more wells should be drilled on the 400,000 mu of self-flowing irrigated land to ensure a bumper wheat harvest. (2) The construction of medium and small-sized water conservancy projects in various places is being accelerated, striving to build and use them simultaneously. In the entire area, more than 2,100 projects are under construction. Due to the implementation of simultaneous construction and storage, and simultaneous storage and use, 630,000 mu of land have been watered, and 1.2 million mu can be watered before the end of March. (3) Hilly and mountainous areas that are water conservancy dead ends are the main focus of the current drought resistance movement. Relying on carrying loads on shoulders and using pots and jars to water drop by drop can only save the seedlings and cannot withstand the test of prolonged drought. Therefore, decisive drought resistance measures are being taken in various places: vigorously drilling wells and building pumping stations to draw water up the mountains. More than 2,400 machine wells are under construction in the entire area, of which 636 have been completed, and 54,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated; 540 pumping stations are being built, of which 237 have been completed, and most have started watering the land. In Mengjin County, 48 machine wells have been drilled on the Mangshan Ridge, and the plateau, which has not been irrigated for thousands of years, has realized water networking. The County Party Committee decided to drill 500 machine wells on the Mangshan Ridge in March, so that 150,000 mu of wheat can be guaranteed a bumper harvest even without rain. In Yiyang, 15,000 people have been invested in the pumping station construction movement, and 132 pumping stations have been built, with 220 power machines installed, which can irrigate 44,000 mu of wheat and 3,000 mu of large autumn land. The county also conducts surveys and planning for each ditch, ridge, and river basin, and vigorously develops groundwater; in order to adapt to the characteristics of dispersed land and lack of water sources in mountainous areas, it is determined to build an irrigation system that stores, pumps, diverts, and irrigates. The severe drought has forced people to open up the road to water conservancy in the Mangshan and hilly areas.
    The more the drought develops, the more urgent the demand for agricultural drought resistance machinery in rural areas. The entire area has 50,000 horsepower of mechanical equipment, of which 30,000 horsepower is incomplete or damaged and not repaired. In order to strengthen industrial support for the drought resistance movement, the Prefectural Party Committee organized relevant departments to establish a leading group for industrial support for drought resistance, and set up an office. Counties, cities, factories, and mines have also made specific plans and studied support measures. A total of 431 mechanical repair groups, with a total of 3,040 people, have been organized in the entire area. Each factory in Luoyang City organized 36 teams, led by the responsible comrades of the factory, and implemented the method of five guarantees (guarantee equipment, guarantee matching, guarantee installation, guarantee maintenance, guarantee technical training), went deep into the countryside to repair machinery, and all factories in the city also transferred a large number of power machinery to support drought resistance. In the drought resistance movement, the established fixed cooperation system between factories and counties and communes has played a huge role. The Luoyang Tractor Factory organized 11 repair teams, bringing 2,700 horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery to Yanshi, Linru, and Mianchi and other places to fight drought. The Mengjin County Machinery Factory completed 100 sets of "rocket cones" in one day and one night. This communist style of the working class is warmly welcomed by the peasants. In Qingyang County, Gansu, the Liangfeng Commune excavated open channels to divert water to the original. This ditch is 23 meters deep.

    洛阳专区全民奋战旱魔
    丘陵区山区水利死角正大打机井大建抽水机站
    厂矿企业派出工人调集动力机械大力支援抗旱
    编者按　洛阳地委在领导广大群众进行抗旱斗争中，认真分析本地情况，进行水利站队，对不同地区采取不同措施的作法很好。特别是对水利条件不好的山区丘陵区，积极勘查规划，大建抽水机站，大打机井，这是山区从根本上战胜干旱、实现山区水利化的措施。同时，像洛阳地委这样迅速动员和组织各个厂矿企业热情地、主动地支援抗旱斗争，这是使工人和农民、城市和乡村密切结合起来，战胜干旱夺取小麦大丰收的保证。
    本报讯　河南洛阳专区抗旱浇麦、抗旱春播已形成群众运动高潮。去冬以来，豫西地区雨雪奇缺，3、4、5月雨量仍然偏少，中共洛阳地委充分估计了这一严重情况，认为当前必须集中一切力量战胜干旱。目前，从城市到农村，从厂矿、企业到机关、学校全面行动起来。由地委第一书记挂帅组成的九个工作团，已经奔往抗旱前线；各县委已抽调三万多人，投入抗旱斗争；厂矿、企业一面赶制水利机具，一面派出技术人员到抗旱工地检修机具和传授技术；财贸、文教、卫生等部门，也作出规划，坚决为抗旱服务。
    洛阳专区抗旱浇麦从1月底开始以来，取得了很大成绩。全区二百五十万亩有自流灌溉设施的地方，已普浇一次，有些地区浇了两次，浇灌质量都很好。当前群众抗旱运动正向三个方面发展：（一）对已经实现水利化的地区，即汝、伊、洛、涧河两岸平川地区，为了彻底战胜干旱，正大打机井，实行井、渠双保险。如偃师县委决定3月底前，要在四十万亩自流灌溉的土地上，再打一千眼井，以确保小麦大丰收。（二）各地正在兴建中的中、小型水利工程，正在加快速度，争取边建设，边使用。全区二千一百多处正在修建工程，由于实行边修边蓄，边蓄边用，已经浇地六十三万亩，3月底前可浇地一百二十万亩。（三）丘陵、山区水利死角地区是当前抗旱运动的主要锋芒。这些地区依靠采取担担挑挑，盆盆罐罐点浇的方法，只能起救苗的作用，经受不起长期干旱的考验。因此，各地正采取决定性的抗旱措施：大打机井和建设抽水机站，引水上山。全区正在施工的机井有二千四百多眼，已完成六百三十六眼，五万四千亩麦田得到灌溉；建抽水机站五百四十处，已完成二百三十七处，大都开始浇地。孟津县在邙山岭上打成了四十八眼机井，几千年来不能灌溉的高原实现了水网化。县委决定在邙山岭上，3月份打成五百眼机井，这样就可以保证十五万亩小麦无雨也丰收。宜阳已有一万五千人投入建站运动，目前已建成抽水机站一百三十二处，安装好二百二十部动力机械，可浇麦四万四千亩，大秋地三千亩。这个县还逐沟、逐岭、逐流域进行勘查规划，大搞地下水；为适应山区土地分散，水源缺乏的特点，决心建成一个蓄、抽、引、灌的灌溉系统。严重的干旱迫使人们打开了邙山、丘陵地区水利化的道路。
    旱情越发展，农村对农业抗旱机械的要求越迫切。全区有五万马力的机械设备，其中三万马力不成套，或损坏没有修好。为了加强工业对抗旱运动的支援，地委组织有关部门成立了工业支援抗旱领导小组，并设立了办公室。各县、市、厂矿也具体规划，研究支援措施。全区共组织机械修配组四百三十一个，共三千零四十人。洛阳市各工厂组织三十六个队，由工厂负责同志率领，实行五包（包设备、包配套、包安装、包维修、包技术培训）的办法，深入农村修配机具，全市各工厂还调出大批动力机械支援抗旱。在抗旱运动中，已建立起来的厂与县、社的固定协作制度，发挥了巨大作用。洛阳拖拉机厂组织了十一个修理队，带了二千七百马力的排灌机械到偃县、临汝、渑池等地抗旱。孟津县十五个机械厂一天一夜完成一百套“火箭锥”。工人阶级这种共产主义风格，受到农民热烈欢迎。甘肃庆阳县两峰公社开挖明渠引水上原，这条沟深二十三米。
