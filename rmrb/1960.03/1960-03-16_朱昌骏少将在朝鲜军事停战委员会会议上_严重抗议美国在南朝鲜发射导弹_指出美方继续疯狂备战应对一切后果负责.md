Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 15th: At the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting today, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged a serious protest against the US side's crime of blatantly launching "Matador" missiles in South Korea in serious violation of the armistice agreement.

The US Air Force's 58th Missile Combat Squadron, stationed in South Korea, launched "Matador" missiles in Osan, South Korea, from 15:30 to 16:00 on February 26th.

At the meeting convened at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, Major General Zhu Changjun said that the US launch of "Matador" missiles completely violated the preamble and spirit of the armistice agreement, and was a gross violation of Article 13D, Article 17, Article 24, Article 35, and Article 61 of the armistice agreement. It was also a provocative act of preparing a new war in Korea and ravaging peace in Asia and the world. Major General Zhu Changjun also protested the US side's continued introduction of various new weapons such as "Matador," "Nike Hercules," and "Hawk" missiles into South Korea in violation of the armistice agreement. He emphasized that for a long time, the US side has been systematically and step-by-step expanding its armaments and preparing for war in South Korea, and today this arms race activity by the US side has developed to an extremely rampant level.

Major General Zhu Changjun revealed that "In order to adapt to the needs of the US's arms expansion and war preparation on a global scale under the new situation, US Commander-in-Chief Magruder submitted a plan to the US military authorities last year to expand armaments and prepare for war in South Korea. This plan not only calls for the illegal introduction of new weapons, including various missiles, to enhance the US military's atomic attack capability, but also for vigorously equipping the Syngman Rhee puppet army with modern weapons. US Secretary of the Army Bruck stated without concealment in January of this year that US military authorities are carefully studying Magruder's above-mentioned plan."

Major General Zhu Changjun said: "US Army Chief of Staff Lemnitzer publicly declared before the US Congress not long ago that the US military occupying South Korea 'hopes to possess the most modern equipment'."

Major General Zhu Changjun then pointed out that, in fact, Magruder's above-mentioned plan has been frantically put into practice. Magruder admitted on February 26th that the US Department of Defense had allocated funds to the US military occupying South Korea in order to expand its military equipment. He also claimed that "the situation will become completely satisfactory within three months."

On March 3rd, Syngman Rhee's puppet Minister of National Defense, Kim Jung-yeol, announced at a press conference that the equipment of the US military occupying South Korea and the Rhee puppet army had undergone "significant improvements." Not only that, the US side even launched illegally introduced missiles this time. This behavior of the US side in violating the armistice agreement has seriously threatened peace in Korea and the security of the Korean-Chinese side.

Major General Zhu Changjun strongly demanded that the US side immediately remove all illegally introduced missiles and atomic weapons from South Korea, stop launching these new weapons, and severely punish the masterminds and relevant US personnel who organized and directed the introduction and launch of the missiles in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement.

During the nearly three-hour meeting, the US chief representative, Medaris, dared not directly address the issues raised by the Korean-Chinese side, but unreasonably rejected the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

Major General Zhu Changjun sternly warned the US side that if the US side continues to prepare for war frantically, then the US side will not only accelerate its own demise, but must also bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    朱昌骏少将在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上
    严重抗议美国在南朝鲜发射导弹
    指出美方继续疯狂备战应对一切后果负责
    新华社平壤15日电　板门店消息：朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上就美方严重违反停战协定公然在南朝鲜发射“斗牛士”式导弹的罪行提出严重抗议。
    盘踞在南朝鲜的美国空军第五十八导弹战斗队在2月26日十五时三十分至十六时在南朝鲜乌山发射了“斗牛士”式导弹。
    朱昌骏少将在这次由朝中方面建议召开的会议上说，美方发射“斗牛士”式导弹的行为完全违背了停战协定的序言和它的精神，是对停战协定的第十三款卯项、第十七款、二十四款、三十五款和六十一款的粗暴的破坏，也是在朝鲜准备新战争和蹂躏亚洲和世界和平的挑衅行为。朱昌骏少将还抗议美方违反停战协定继续把“斗牛士”式、“奈克·赫尔克里士”式和“隼”式导弹等各种新式武器运入南朝鲜。他强调指出，长时期来美方就在南朝鲜有计划有步骤地扩军备战，而今天美方的这种备战活动已经发展到极其猖狂的地步。
    朱昌骏少将揭露说，“为了适应美国在新形势下在全世界范围内的扩军备战的需要，美方总司令马格鲁德去年向美国军事当局提出了一项在南朝鲜扩军备战的计划。这项计划不仅要求非法运入包括各种导弹在内的新式武器，以增强美军的原子攻击能力，而且还要用现代化武器大力装备李承晚伪军。美国陆军部长布鲁克在今年1月毫不掩饰地说，美国军事当局正在仔细研究马格鲁德的上述计划”。
      朱昌骏少将说：美国陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔不久前在美国国会作证时公然宣称强占南朝鲜的美军“希望拥有最新式的装备”。
      朱昌骏少将接着指出，事实上马格鲁德的上述计划，已经在疯狂地付诸实施。马格鲁德在2月26日承认，美国国防部已经拨款给强占南朝鲜的美军以便扩充军备。他还声称“三个月内情况就会变得完全令人满意”。
      3月3日，李承晚伪国防部长官金贞烈在记者招待会上宣布，强占南朝鲜的美军和李伪军的装备已经有了“显著的改善”。不仅如此，美方这次竟发射了非法运入的导弹。美方这种违反停战协定的行为，使朝鲜和平和朝中方面的安全遭到了严重的威胁。
    朱昌骏少将强硬要求美方立即把一切非法运入的导弹和原子武器运出南朝鲜，停止发射这些新式武器，并且根据停战协定的规定，严厉惩罚组织指挥运入和发射导弹的主谋者和有关的美方人员。
    在近三个小时的会议过程中，美方首席委员麦达思一直不敢正面谈论朝中方面提出的问题，只是无理地拒绝朝中方面的要求。
    朱昌骏少将严正警告美方，如果美方继续疯狂地准备战争，那么美方不仅将加速自取灭亡的过程，而且必须对由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任。
