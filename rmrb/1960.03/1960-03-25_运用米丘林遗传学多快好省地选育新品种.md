    Selecting New Varieties Rapidly, Economically, and Effectively by Applying Michurin Genetics

    China is world-renowned for its rich resources of crop varieties. This is the result of China's diverse geographical conditions and the long-term selection by the working people. At present, according to incomplete statistics, there are 2,444 varieties used in production, of which 1,027 are new varieties selected and bred after liberation. In the past ten years, not only has the number of new varieties increased rapidly, but also the quality has greatly improved. They generally have characteristics such as high yield, fertilizer resistance, and disease resistance, and are more suitable for mechanized harvesting. Many varieties have been demonstrated and promoted, and have played a significant role in increasing production.
    The rapid development of crop breeding work in China is due not only to putting politics in command and implementing the policy of combining scientific research institute breeding with mass breeding, but also to the application and promotion of Michurin genetics, which is a very important factor.
    Michurin genetics was established and developed by Michurin and his successors in production practice. Its theory and methods are permeated with dialectical materialism, and its goal is to transform nature and increase production. Therefore, the theory of Michurin genetics is easily accepted by the broad masses, and its methods are easily adopted by breeding workers.
    Directed Cultivation Theory is the Direction of China's Breeding Work
    Michurin genetics' theory about the unity of organisms and environmental conditions, and its directed cultivation theory, pointed out the direction for China's breeding work. For many years, under the influence of formal genetics theory, people believed that species were innate and immutable; that although environmental conditions could cause variations in organisms, these variations were undirected and could not be inherited; and that hybrid breeding could only rearrange the original traits of the two parents, and there could be no other creative role in selecting suitable individuals from hybrid offspring. All these arguments actually mean that mankind can only wait for and enjoy the gifts of nature, and breeding work can only select existing things, and is therefore limited.
    The above-mentioned arguments of formal genetics have long been overturned by Michurin's numerous research results. The research results of genetics in China also show the falsity of those arguments. For example, a large number of plant stage development analyses conducted in China can show that plant development characteristics are closely related to the latitude, terrain, and altitude of the place of origin, that is, related to temperature, humidity, airflow, and the length and intensity of sunlight. Regions with different conditions produce varieties with different developmental characteristics. This is a conclusive example of the dialectical unity between organisms and environmental conditions.
    From our research work, we have also seen many phenomena of changes in plant heredity through changes in living conditions. For example, the initial transfer of northern apples and peaches to the south, and the northward push of rubber trees and eucalyptus trees originating in subtropical regions, were not smooth, but after several years of cultivation and adaptation, they can gradually grow and develop normally in the new regions. Another example is the use of changing the sowing date to sow spring millet in late autumn, which not only improves vitality but also causes many obvious variations in the shape of the ear; sowing spring wheat in late autumn, and then sowing the obtained seeds at the normal sowing date for winter wheat, can transform spring wheat into winter wheat.
    In our country, we also use low-temperature cultivation to breed new cotton varieties with higher cold resistance, short fruit branches, and compact plant shapes; we use methods such as transplanting, removing tillers, increasing fertilizer application, spraying biological stimulants, and controlling the interrelationship between growth and development to breed coriaceous, winter-type branching wheat; and we increase the salt tolerance of wheat by gradually increasing the salt content of the soil, and there is a tendency to transform it into a xerophytic plant. All of these not only indicate that genetic performance changes with changes in living conditions, but also that it can be changed in a directed manner toward the aspects needed by humans through artificial control, and finally become new and superior varieties.
    Michurin genetics has found an effective way to breed using selection methods. In the past, under the theory of the immutability of species, some people believed that humans could only select pre-existing superior systems or genetically different individuals from complex and impure variety populations, and that once a variety was purified, further selection was ineffective. They believed that even if variant individuals occurred in purified varieties, these were somatic cell variations and could not be inherited; on the contrary, according to the principles of Michurin genetics and the years of experience of production practitioners, the changes in varieties are endless, and even if not all variant individuals produced by a variety can be inherited, it is not impossible to select more superior varieties from superior varieties. In fact, in the practice of breeding work in China, there are many such examples. For example, Luchai No., Nantao Early, Nantao No. 16, and Dwarf Nantao No. selected from the superior rice variety Nantao No., Yapeng Cotton selected from Daizi Cotton, and Xuzhou 209 selected from Sizi Cotton Erbi, all have advantages that exceed their original varieties and are now being demonstrated and promoted as new varieties.
    Not only that, according to the theory of formal genetics, when using individual selection methods for breeding, the collection of single ears or single plants becomes a heavy task, often requiring eight or nine years or more. Michurin genetics theory believes that the collection and selection of single ears or single plants should be given careful observation and evaluation in many aspects, so new and superior varieties can be selected at a lower cost and faster.
    The Selection of Hybrid Parents is the Key to the Success or Failure of Breeding Work
    When conducting hybrid (mating and combining plants of different families, genera, species, varieties, or varieties) breeding, in the past, parents were selected based on visible characteristics and traits, hoping to select individuals with certain beneficial traits of both parents in the hybrid offspring for breeding through sexual hybridization. This approach can only succeed if a large number of crosses are carried out and there are many hybrid offspring, otherwise it is often in vain.
    Michurin genetics has made very important improvements to hybrid breeding, regarding the selection of hybrid parents as the key to the success or failure of the work. Although the traits of hybrid parents are used as one of the selection conditions, it is considered more important to have a full understanding of the history of the two parents, the environmental conditions of their place of origin and their differences, the stage development characteristics, age, health status and their differences, etc. Michurin genetics attaches so much importance to the selection of parents because it is based on the law of dominance it revealed. This law indicates that the manifestation and concealment of traits can change with the changes in the internal and external conditions of the hybrid parents, and with the changes in the comparison of the genetic transmission power between the two parents. In the hybrid experiments conducted on peas in China in recent years, it has been seen that with the extension of the storage period of pollen, in the hybrid offspring, the traits of the male parent that were originally considered to be dominant became recessive, which is inconceivable in formal genetics that understands dominance and recessiveness as fixed and unchanging. However, facts show that only by mastering the law of dominance can hybrid breeding be carried out more successfully. As everyone knows, Academician Lysenko bred a new early-maturing wheat variety in two and a half years based on the results of stage development characteristics analysis. In recent years, under the inspiration of Michurin genetics, the efficiency and speed of hybrid breeding work in China have also been improved.
    Creating New Plant Types with Asexual Hybridization Methods
    The application of asexual hybridization (plant mating and combination completed by vegetative organs—stem, bud, root grafting is called asexual hybridization) methods to create new plant types was initiated and developed by Michurin and his successors, and the application of this method in breeding has become increasingly widespread. In recent years, some capitalist countries have also begun to conduct research in this area and have obtained asexual hybrids.
    Asexual hybridization research has achieved rich results in China, and some excellent varieties have been bred. For example, using upland cotton Daizi No. 14 as rootstock to nourish and cultivate island cotton, a new strain (named Longrong No. 3) with a long fiber of more than 40 mm and a maturity period no later than upland cotton has been bred; and using the apple variety "Guoguang" as rootstock to nourish and cultivate the "Marshal" variety, a hybrid with both fragrance, beauty, and storage resistance (named "Guoshuai") has been bred. In addition, there are some examples in China of applying grafting methods in production practice to create the first generation of hybrids with strong vitality, and there have been production increase effects.
    A large number of experiments have shown that asexual hybrids are largely the same as sexual hybrids in terms of genetic phenomena, but asexual hybridization has special significance in breeding work. Because grafting is easier than pollination to obtain hybrids between many distantly related plants, and the diversity of hybrid offspring is also wider, which opens up a broad road for the breeding of new varieties.
    Breeding New Varieties with Distant Hybridization Methods
    Breeding with distant hybridization (including sexual and asexual) methods was also proposed by Michurin, and Michurin created many miracles in this regard. However, when Michurin succeeded in distant hybridization, conservative scientists ridiculed him for being ignorant, and even today some people still hold a skeptical attitude. These people are observing the problem through the lens of formal genetics, and they neither understand nor study how to overcome the incompatibility between distantly related types.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, scientists and especially farmer breeders in China have broken superstitions and emancipated their minds, and have made many achievements in distant hybridization. For example, a farmer breeder in China hybridized barnyard grass and rice to breed a hybrid rice with more than 1,100 grains per ear. Research institutions hybridized rye and wheat, and treated the first-generation seedlings with colchicine to obtain hybrid wheat with more than 90 grains per ear, a thousand-grain weight of more than 50 grams, and stiff stalks that can resist three types of rust. When hibiscus and cotton were hybridized, some cotton plants with a fiber length of 48 mm and a ginning percentage of 50% appeared in the offspring. All of the above-mentioned excellent performances of these distant hybrids in the offspring cannot be obtained by intervarietal hybridization.
    Why does formal genetics believe that distant hybridization cannot be used for breeding work? Because distant hybridization is not easy to succeed, and even if it succeeds, the resulting hybrids may not be able to bear fruit, but these difficulties have long been overcome by Michurin genetics. Based on his years of observation and research, Michurin saw that in order to make distant hybridization possible, it is necessary to find ways to bring the biological characteristics of the two sexual factors closer, to shake the heredity of the parents, and to prevent the physiological processes and reproductive functions of the hybrids from being destroyed to the extent that they cannot be carried out. Thus, he created various ingenious measures to overcome the incompatibility between distantly related types and the infertility of distant hybrids. These measures have also been used very effectively in breeding work in China in recent years.
    For example, in the above-mentioned hybridization of cotton and hibiscus, the maternal parent was a hybrid between Zhongmian and Daizi cotton, and its heredity had great plasticity; in the hybridization of barnyard grass and rice, the maternal parent rice was a hybrid, and the paternal parent barnyard grass was introduced from afar, and its place of origin had very different local conditions from the hybridization site, which means that the heredity of the former was not yet conservative, and the heredity of the latter had been shaken, which all conforms to the principles of Michurin genetics for creating distant hybrids. In addition, there are also studies in China on hybridizing loofah and cucumber, and hybridizing willow and poplar trees, which have all been successful. The success of the former is due to first using loofah as rootstock to conduct asexual cultivation of cucumber to bring it closer to the biological characteristics of loofah, and then pollinating it with the mixed pollen of the two; the success of the latter is due to adding small pieces of poplar pistil and its juice to the willow pistil before pollinating the willow with poplar pollen to help the germination of poplar pollen. The success of these research works is also a victory for Michurin genetics.
    From the above, it can be seen that Michurin genetics has not only made fundamental reforms to the commonly used methods of systematic selection and intervarietal sexual hybridization, but also created new methods with broad prospects such as asexual hybridization, distant hybridization, and directed cultivation. In another sense, the roads that have been restricted and blocked by formal genetics in breeding work for many years have been broadened and opened up one by one by Michurin genetics. The work that was previously considered to be luck-based, limited, and sieve-like has become directional, controllable, unlimited, and creative. This change undoubtedly provides huge possibilities for selecting new varieties rapidly, economically, and effectively.
    Of course, in addition to the above-mentioned methods, there are other breeding methods. Any method, if not used in combination with other methods, is not easy to obtain good results, or it will take more years. For example, when breeding with the directed cultivation method, it is best to use hybrid materials with shaken heredity or materials introduced from afar; when breeding with the distant hybridization method, in addition to best using the above-mentioned materials, after obtaining hybrids, it is also advisable to give corresponding environmental conditions for directed cultivation, so it is easy to obtain the expected results quickly and well. This should be done even more when breeding with artificial mutation methods, because although this method has also had some development in the past ten years, it is still basically in the exploratory stage to this day. If it is used alone as the main means, the chance of success is extremely rare. Artificial mutation, as a breeding method, should well absorb the experiences of success and failure over the years.
    In order to develop China's agricultural production at high speed, breeding work must conscientiously follow the policy of combining scientific research institute breeding with mass breeding, widely apply the theory and methods of Michurin genetics, and select a large number of excellent varieties rapidly, economically, and effectively.

    运用米丘林遗传学多快好省地选育新品种
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所副所长中国科学院遗传研究所副所长  祖德明
    我国农作物品种资源丰富闻名于世界。这是我国地理条件多样和劳动人民积年累月选择的结果。目前，据不完全统计，生产上应用的品种计二千四百四十四个，其中解放后新选育的良种，就有一千零二十七个。十年来，不仅新品种数量增加很快，在质量上也大有提高，一般具有丰产、耐肥、抗病等特性，较适于机械化收割。有不少品种已在示范推广，起了显著增产作用。
    我国作物育种工作能够得到这样快的发展，除了政治挂帅，贯彻科学研究机关育种与群众育种相结合的方针外，运用和提倡米丘林遗传学，也是一个非常重要的因素。
    米丘林遗传学是米丘林及其继承者在生产实践中确立和发展起来的，它的理论和方法贯穿着辩证唯物主义，它的奋斗目标是改造自然，提高生产。所以米丘林遗传学的理论容易为广大群众所接受，它的方法也容易为育种工作者所采用。
    定向培育理论是我国育种工作的方向
    米丘林遗传学关于有机体和环境条件的统一，及其定向培育的理论，为我国育种工作指出了方向。多年来，在形式遗传学理论影响之下，人们以为物种是天生的，不变的；认为环境条件虽能使生物体发生变异，但这种变异是不定向的，而且不能遗传；还认为杂交育种只能使两亲原有的性状重新搭配，在从杂种后代中选取合乎需要的个体方面，不能再有其他创造性的作用。所有这些论断，实际上是说，人类只能等待和享受自然界的恩赐，育种工作只能选取现存的东西，因而是有限的。
    形式遗传学的上述论断，早已被米丘林的大量研究成果所推翻。我国遗传学的研究成果也说明了那些论断的虚伪性。例如，在我国所作大量的植物阶段发育分析工作中都可以表明，植物发育特性和原产地的纬度、地势、海拔有密切关系，也就是和温度、湿度、气流、日照长度和强度有关。这些条件不同的地区产生发育特性不同的品种。这就是生物体与环境条件具有辩证统一关系的确凿例证。
    从我国的研究工作中，还看到了不少通过改变生活条件使植物遗传性发生变化的现象。例如，将北方苹果和桃移向南方，将原产于亚热带的橡胶树和桉树向北推移，最初都不顺利，但经数年的培育和适应过程，即能逐渐在新地区正常生长发育。又如采用改变播种期的方法，将春播的谷子于晚秋播种，结果除生活力提高外，还能使穗形产生许多明显的变异；将春小麦于晚秋播种，所获种子再于冬小麦正常播期播种，即可变春小麦为冬小麦。
    我国还有用低温培育的方法，育成了耐寒力较高、果枝短而株形紧凑的新棉花品种；用移植、去分蘖、增施肥料、喷射生物刺激素以及控制生长和发育的相互关系等方法，育出了角质的冬性的分枝小麦；以逐渐增加土壤含盐量的方法，提高了小麦的耐盐性，并有使其转变为旱生植物的倾向。所有这些不仅指明，遗传性能随生活条件的变化而改变，而且可以通过人为控制，使其定向地朝着人类需要的方面改变，最后成为新的优良品种。
    米丘林遗传学为用选择的方法进行育种找到了有效途径。过去在物种不变的理论支配下，有些人认为人类只有在庞杂不纯的品种的群体中，选取早已存在的优良系统或遗传性不同的个体，品种一旦纯化之后，再行选择是无效的。他们认为纯化了的品种，纵有变异个体发生，但这是体细胞的变异，不能遗传；与此相反，根据米丘林遗传学的原理和生产实践者多年的经验，品种的变化是永无休止的，一个品种所产生的变异个体，纵然不是都能遗传，但从优良品种选育更优良的品种，不是不可能的。事实上，在我国育种工作的实践中，有不少这样的例子。例如，从水稻良种南特号选出的陆财号、南特早、南特十六号、矮脚南特号，从岱字棉选出的鸭棚棉，从斯字棉二比选出的徐州二○九，都具有超出其原品种的优点，现已作为新品种在示范推广中。
    不仅如此，按照形式遗传学的理论，在运用个体选拔的方法进行育种时，单穗或单株的采取，成为繁重的工作，常常需要八、九年以上的时间，米丘林遗传学的理论认为单穗或单株的采选，应该给以多方面细心的观察和评价，如此可以用较少的代价较快地选育出新的良种。
    杂交亲本的选择是育种工作成败的关键
    在进行杂交（不同科、不同属、不同种、不同变种、或不同品种间的植株交配结合）育种时，过去都是以可见的特征和特性为依据来选用亲本，希望通过有性杂交，在杂种后代中选到兼有两亲某些有利性状的个体进行育种。这种作法只有进行大量杂交，拥有繁多杂种后代的情况下，才有可能成功，否则往往徒劳无获。
    米丘林遗传学对杂交育种作了非常重要的改进，把杂交亲本的选择作为工作成败的关键。杂交亲本的性状虽然被作为选择条件之一，但认为更重要的是，对于两亲的历史，两亲的原产地环境条件及其差异，两亲的阶段发育特性、年龄、健康程度及其差异等等情况，进行充分的了解。米丘林遗传学之所以如此重视亲本的选择，是以其所揭发的显性规律为依据的。这个规律指明，性状的显现和隐匿是能随着杂交亲本内在条件和外在条件的变化、随着两亲间遗传传递力的对比关系的变化而变化的。在我国近年来对豌豆所进行的杂交试验中，即曾看到，随着花粉贮藏期间的延长，在杂种后代中，父本性状原认为应表现为显性的性状变成了隐性，这在把显性和隐性理解为固定不变的形式遗传学看来是不可思议的。但是事实说明，只有掌握了显性规律，才能较为得心应手地进行杂交育种。大家知道，李森科院士根据阶段发育特性分析的结果，用两年半的时间便育出了一个新的早熟的小麦品种。近几年来，我国杂交育种工作在米丘林遗传学启示之下，也提高了效率和速度。
    用无性杂交方法创造植物新类型
    应用无性杂交（植株交配结合借营养体——茎、芽、根嫁接完成的叫做无性杂交）方法创造植物新类型是由米丘林及其继承者们倡始和发展起来的，这一方法在育种上的应用已越来越广泛。近年来，有些资本主义国家也开始进行这方面的研究，并获得了无性杂种。
    无性杂交的研究在我国得到了丰富的成果，育出了一些优良品种。例如，用陆地棉岱字十四号为砧木教养海岛棉的方法，育出了一个具有四十毫米以上的长绒而成熟期不晚于陆地棉的新品系（名为长绒三号）；又以苹果品种“国光”为砧木教养“元帅”品种的方法，育出了既有香味、美观又耐贮藏的杂种（名为“国帅”）。此外，在生产实践上应用嫁接方法创育生活力强盛的杂种第一代，在我国也有一些例子，并有了增产效果。
    大量试验表明，无性杂种在遗传现象上是和有性杂种大同小异的，但在育种工作上，无性杂交具有特殊的意义。因为在许多远缘植物间进行嫁接比授粉容易获得杂种，杂种后代的多样性也较广泛，这就为新品种的育成，开辟了宽广的道路。
    用远缘杂交的方法培育新品种
    用远缘杂交（包括有性的和无性的）的方法育种也是由米丘林提出的，米丘林在这一方面创造了许多奇迹。但是，当米丘林进行远缘杂交成功时守旧的科学家曾经讥笑他为无知，甚至今天仍有人抱着怀疑的态度。这些人都是戴着形式遗传学的眼镜来观察问题的，他们既不晓得也不研究如何克服远缘类型间的不可杂交性。
    近几年来，我国科学工作者特别是农民育种家，在党的领导下，破除迷信，解放思想，在远缘杂交方面作出了许多成绩。例如，我国农民育种家以稗草与水稻杂交，育出了一穗结一千数百粒的杂种水稻。研究机关以黑麦与小麦杂交，并以秋水仙精处理其第一代幼苗，获得了一穗九十多粒、千粒重五十多克，且秆硬、能抗三种锈病的杂种小麦。以朱槿与棉花杂交，在后代中出现了一部分纤维长四十八毫米、衣分达50％的棉株。所有以上这些远缘杂种在后代中的优异表现，都是品种间杂交所不能得到的。
    为什么形式遗传学认为远缘杂交不可能用来进行育种工作呢？因为远缘杂交不易成功，即使成功了，所得杂种不一定能结实，但这些难关早被米丘林遗传学攻破了。米丘林根据自己多年的观察和研究看出，要想使远缘杂交成为可能，必须设法使两性因素的生物学特性相互接近，使亲本的遗传性发生动摇，使杂种生理过程和生殖机能不致破坏到不能进行的程度，于是创造了种种巧妙的措施，克服了远缘类型间的不可杂交性和远缘杂种的不孕性。这些措施在我国几年来的育种工作中也已运用得很有成效。
    例如，上述棉花与朱槿的杂交，母本是中棉同岱字棉间的杂种，其遗传性具有很大的可塑性；稗草与水稻的杂交，母本水稻是一杂种，父本稗草是从远处引进的，其原产地风土条件与杂交地点有很大不同，就是说，前者遗传性还未保守，后者遗传性业已动摇，这都符合米丘林遗传学创造远缘杂种的原则。此外，我国还有关于丝瓜与黄瓜杂交，柳树和杨树杂交的研究，都得到了成功。前者的成功是由于先以丝瓜为砧木，对黄瓜进行无性教养，使其接近于丝瓜的生物学特性，然后再授以两者的混合花粉；后者的成功是由于在给柳树授以杨树花粉之前，在柳树柱头上加上杨树柱头的小块及其浆汁，以助杨树花粉的发芽。这些研究工作的成功，也都是米丘林遗传学的胜利。
    由上可见，米丘林遗传学不仅对以往通用的系统选择和品种间有性杂交等育种方法作了根本性的改革，而且还创造了无性杂交、远缘杂交和定向培育等等有广大前途的新方法。从另一个意义上说，就是在育种工作上多年来被形式遗传学所局限和堵塞的道路，一一被米丘林遗传学拓宽和打通。过去认为碰运气的、有限量的、过筛子似的工作，变成了可以定向控制的、无限量的、创造性的工作。这种变化无疑是为多快好省地选育新品种提供了巨大可能性。
    当然，育种方法除上述几种外，还有其他的方法。任何一个方法如不与其他方法综合应用，都不易得到良好结果，或者要费较多的年限。例如，用定向培育法育种时，最好利用遗传性动摇了的杂种材料或从远处引进的材料；利用远缘杂交方法育种时，除也最好利用上述材料外，在获得杂种之后，还宜给以相应的环境条件，进行定向培育，这样容易又好又快地得到预期成果。在以人工引变的方法育种时，更应如此，因为这个方法近十年来虽也有一些发展，但直到今日，基本上还属于摸索阶段，如作为主要手段单独使用，成功的机会是极其稀少的。人工引变作为一项育种的方法，应该很好地吸取多年来的成败经验。
    为了高速度地发展我国的农业生产，育种工作必须切实遵循科学研究机关育种与群众育种相结合的方针，广泛运用米丘林遗传学的理论和方法，多快好省地选育出大量的优良品种。
