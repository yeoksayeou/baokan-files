County-Run Industries Can Achieve Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization at High Speed
Dong Qimin, First Secretary of the Yicheng County Party Committee, Shanxi Province; Sun Zongdi, Executive Secretary

The local industry of Yicheng County has undergone rapid development since liberation. By the end of October 1959, the county already had sixty-four factories and mines, with a total industrial output value twenty times higher than in 1949. However, the entire local industry was basically manual operation. Before November of last year, only five of the county's twenty-two local state-owned factories and mines had achieved semi-mechanized production, while the remaining 77% of the factories and mines were still operating manually. Workers engaged in semi-mechanized and mechanized production accounted for only 31.28% of the total number of workers. This technologically backward situation not only affected the improvement of labor productivity and the rapid development of industrial production, but also prominently exposed the contradiction between industrial development and labor shortages.

In order to solve this problem, under the correct leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Jinan Prefectural Party Committee, the county Party committee examined the reasons for the slow progress and low efficiency in the past, adopted the policy of putting politics in command and launching a mass movement, and called on all employees to "work hard for a month to basically achieve mechanization." As a result, after twenty days of hard work, significant achievements were made. As of December 20 last year, fourteen of the county-run twenty-two factories and mines had achieved mechanization, four had achieved semi-mechanization, with workers using mechanical production accounting for 64% of the total number of workers, and semi-mechanized production accounting for 30%. Seven of the nine commune factories had achieved complete sets of processes, adopting semi-mechanized and mechanized production. During the movement, a total of more than 170 types of tractor cylinder heads, power saws, threading machines, steam hammers, cold forging hammers, etc., were created and imitated. Even fuel injection nozzles, which were difficult to manufacture and not easy to buy, were successfully trial-produced by the machinery factory of Nanliang Commune and put into production. Since then, the industrial history of manual operation in our county has come to an end, and the broad masses of employees have been liberated from heavy physical labor, bringing local industry into a new stage in terms of production and equipment.

As long as the Party Committee leads, nothing is impossible

To quickly change the "poor" and "blank" face of local industry, we must unswervingly and at high speed carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Putting politics in command and strengthening the leadership of the Party are the decisive factors for ensuring high speed. In the past, we did not have enough understanding of this point. Therefore, the progress of the technical innovation movement in the first half of last year was not very fast, and the effect was not very great. In late November of last year, the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held an industrial on-site meeting in Houma City, which gave us great inspiration and encouragement. It was unanimously believed that as long as Houma could do it, we would definitely be able to do it. It was immediately decided to establish a technical innovation and technical revolution steering committee headed by the First Secretary, and put forward the slogan of "Learn from Houma, Catch up with Houma, and Surpass Houma." We were determined to fight for a month to change the old face of manual operation. At the beginning of the movement, some people said: "Technical innovation is good, but Yicheng cannot do it," "It is easy for large factories to do, but small factories cannot do it," "It is worthwhile to do complete sets, but it is not cost-effective to do sporadic ones," "Without raw materials, it is just asking for trouble," and so on. The county Party committee had also long anticipated that in order to successfully carry out this movement and achieve the intended purpose, the key issue lay in thoroughly sweeping away the ideological obstacles on the road to advancement. Therefore, a meeting of four-level cadres above the level of group leaders of factories and mining enterprises in the county was immediately convened to analyze the favorable conditions for vigorously engaging in technical innovation and introduce the advanced experience of brother counties. During the deliberation and discussion, the cadres attending the meeting posted more than 27,000 big-character posters and put forward 15,858 rationalization proposals. After item-by-item study, 10,643 rationalization proposals were adopted. After the meeting, each factory and mine also established a technical innovation guidance group, formulated an innovation plan, and decided on reform projects. A planned, led, and vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched; ten days later, 6,827 rationalization proposals had been realized, 298 kinds of tools had been innovated, a total of 2,271 pieces, the work efficiency had been increased by two to seven times, seventy-five laborers had been saved, and a value of 45,610 yuan had been created. The workers reflected: "As long as the Party committee leads, nothing is impossible." This is exactly the case.

The power of the masses can turn the tide

"The power of the masses can turn the tide, and the wisdom of the masses is infinite." After the technical innovation movement was launched, the problem of raw material difficulty was placed before us. This problem not only tested the vigorous mass movement, but also tested the cadres at all levels who led the movement. The county Party committee adopted the policy of "self-reliance as the main, and necessary support as the auxiliary" to deal with the difficulty of raw materials, and put forward the slogans of "Compared to Houma's starting from scratch, learn from Houma's adapting to local conditions, catch up with Houma's making do with whatever is available, surpass Houma's using local methods instead of foreign ones," and mobilized workers to summarize and promote emerging things. As a result, a climax in which everyone could "speak if they can speak, and act if they can act, with each showing their own unique abilities" quickly swept the county. Xin Sheng Coal Mine, which attended the National Heroes Congress, on the basis of "four localizations", after five days and five nights of hard work, realized the automation of transportation above the mine, the mechanization of coal cutting with grooved hand-cranked machines, the lighting of electric lights above and below the mine, and the mining of coal by mine cars. The county Party committee seized this example, organized visits on the one hand, and used written notices on the other. Subsequently, three machinery factories and 240 workers, after ten days of battle, innovated 67 kinds of tools, a total of 170 pieces, increased work efficiency by two to seven times, saved 75 laborers, and created a value of 45,610 yuan, and a new situation emerged: local rail, mechanization of sand screening, blower for forging workshops, steam hammers, semi-mechanization of cold forging, mechanization of threading, circular saws in woodworking workshops, mechanization of grooving, mechanization of mortising, power sawing... The innovative examples of these advanced units greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. "Make the best use of people's talents, make the best use of materials, make coarse wood into fine work, refine waste materials, improve operations, make comprehensive use, use wood instead of iron, find substitutes, make small repairs, make small repairs big, and make thousands of repairs," the flowers of technical innovation using local methods instead of foreign ones, first local and then foreign, bloomed everywhere, and the difficulty of raw materials was solved. The workers of the Pima Shoe Factory, through the method of "three craftsmen (leather, flax, and shoes) becoming one craftsman", used rotten coffin boards to make 16 kinds of new tools such as leather punching machines, so that the whole factory achieved mechanized production, increasing efficiency by one to twelve times, saving the country 65,700 yuan in investment. The construction company, within five days, used waste materials to successfully trial-produce 15 kinds of new tools, a total of 30 pieces, such as tamping machines and universal winches, increasing efficiency by more than 30 times, saving the country more than 23,000 yuan in investment. According to the statistics of 31 county and commune-run factories and mines in December, there were 21 kinds of castings instead of forgings, a total of 150 pieces. The use of wood instead of iron alone saved the country an investment of 839,100 yuan. Practice has proved that the policy of "using local methods instead of foreign ones, first local and then foreign" is very correct. The workers of the Machinery Factory No. 1 said: "Listen to what Shangdang says, wood is used as steel frames, which saves money and is light, and the effect is the same."

Communist Style is Fully Developed

Organizing cooperation, sharing resources, and fully developing the communist style of "leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others" is the best way to solve difficulties in the process of high-speed mechanization. At the beginning of the movement, the county Party committee specifically convened a cooperation meeting of responsible cadres from industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, post and telecommunications, communes, and relevant departments, criticized the tendency of departmentalism that only cared about oneself and did not care about others, put forward the call for the whole county to be one and cooperate with each other, and required every unit, every leading cadre, and even every production team and every worker to vigorously promote the communist spirit of "first others then oneself, advanced promotes backward, backward learns from advanced." Each factory, mine, and department, in accordance with the requirements of the county Party committee, established a cooperation system, determined the content of cooperation. In this way, the atmosphere of industrial-agricultural cooperation, industrial-commercial cooperation, and inter-factory cooperation quickly formed in the county, and the effect was immediately visible. The Pima Shoe Factory and other four units lacked power tools, and the Machinery Factory No. 1 supported them with four diesel engines that they did not need for the time being to carry out technical innovation. In addition to taking out five power machines, the commercial department also adjusted a part of the equipment to vigorously support the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the industrial sector. With the division of cooperation zones and the development of cooperation competitions, the phenomenon of factories and mines, workshops, and teams blaming each other disappeared, and the departmentalism of "keeping a hand" was also swept away. What replaced it was the new fashion and new atmosphere of "going up when encountering difficulties, giving way when encountering convenience, learning when encountering experience, and helping when encountering backwardness." According to the statistics of seven county-run machinery factories and mines, in the twenty days from December 1 to 20, they processed and repaired 7,420 parts for brother factories and mines. The Machinery Factory No. 1 lowered its own power consumption to help the Clothing Factory, Cotton Textile Factory, and other four units achieve mechanization. The advantage of doing so is that it not only promoted the high speed, high standard, and high quality of the technical innovation movement, but also improved the communist consciousness of the broad masses of employees and ensured the overall victory of the technical innovation movement in the county. In addition, the factories and mines implemented the method of combining cadres, workers, and technicians, which further accelerated the speed of semi-mechanization and mechanization. The factory director, workers, and technicians of the Chengguan Commune Machinery Factory, after adopting the method of "three-way joint trial, on-site operation," created and imitated 28 kinds of new tools, 53 pieces, in five days. In the process of supporting agricultural production, the machinery factory successfully trial-produced horse-drawn wheat harvesters, fertilizer drills, and so on. Facts have proved that through cooperation and the method of three combinations, it can not only support the four modernizations of agriculture, but also arm the factories and mines themselves.

Vigorous Competition Movement

Widely establishing pace-setters, planting red flags everywhere, and comprehensively carrying out the competition movement of comparing, learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping are the best ways to win the victory of the technical innovation movement. At the same time as convening the four-level cadre meeting of factories and mines, the county Party committee adopted the method of "grasping everything when going down, and then dividing the work when returning," and coordinated the technical innovation movement with the comparing, learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping movement, advancing side by side and promoting each other. The Technical Innovation Committee and the Competition Committee of the County Party Committee were one and the same, headed by the First Secretary. The Technical Committees of each bureau respectively established three groups for production, innovation, and cooperation. Under the unified leadership of the Party branches of factories and mines at all levels, they implemented line leadership, block contracting, divided forces, and each was responsible for their own responsibilities. The Party branch secretary engaged in innovation and competition, and the factory director engaged in cooperation and production. The competition standard with the content of technical innovation and three mores (more suggestions, more improvements, and more applications) was determined, and the system of reporting daily, evaluating and winning red flags every ten days, and summarizing and rewarding monthly was adhered to. At the same time, in the process of vigorously grasping technical innovation, giving concern to the lives of employees was put on the agenda of Party committees at all levels, with the two being given equal importance and closely integrated. In this way, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees increased day by day, and the heroic labor attitude effectively promoted the technical innovation movement. Each enterprise successively sent 395 skilled craftsmen to advanced places such as Xinjiang and Taiyuan to study and learn from experience, and organized three on-site meetings of large-scale training, large-scale competition, large-scale praise, large-scale rewards, large-scale mobilization, large-scale summary, large-scale visits, large-scale learning, large-scale publicity, and large-scale promotion. The competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward was in full swing in every factory and mine. On the stage, fathers and sons and husbands and wives were not separated, you chased me, and strived to be upstream; in innovation, masters and apprentices were not separated, you helped me learn, and climbed the technical peak together. Therefore, the technical innovation movement was full of vitality, and in one month, 11 advanced pacesetter factories and mines, 148 advanced workshops and teams, and 310 advanced individuals emerged, accounting for one-fourth of the total number of workers. The workers praised the technical innovation movement and said: "Leap forward flowers bloom everywhere, bright and dazzling, as long as you have the ambition to soar to the sky, all kinds of flowers will never fail."

    县营工业能够高速度实现机械化和半机械化
    中共山西省翼城县委第一书记　董启民　常务书记　孙宗堤
    翼城县的地方工业，在解放后有了突飞猛进的发展。到1959年的10月底，全县已经有六十四个厂矿，工业总产值比1949年增长了二十倍。但是，整个地方工业基本上是手工操作。去年11月以前，全县二十二个地方国营厂矿中，只有五个厂矿实现了半机械化的生产，其余77％的厂矿仍然是手工操作。半机械化和机械化生产的工人，仅占工人总数的31．28％。这种技术落后的状况，一方面影响了劳动生产率的提高和工业生产的飞跃发展，另方面还突出地暴露了发展工业同劳力不足的矛盾。
    为了解决这个问题，县委在山西省委、晋南地委的正确领导下，检查了过去进度慢、效果低的原因，采取政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的方针，向全体职工提出了“苦战一个月，基本实现机械化”的号召。结果，经过二十天的苦战，就取得了重大成绩。截至去年12月20日止，县营的二十二个厂矿，有十四个实现了机械化，四个实现了半机械化，采用机械生产的工人，占工人总数的64％，半机械化生产的占工人总数的30％。九个公社工厂，有七个工厂达到了工序配成套，采用了半机械化和机械化生产。在运动中，共创制和仿制了拖拉机缸盖、动力大锯、套丝机、汽锤、冷锻锤等一百七十余种，就连不会造也不容易买到的喷油嘴，也被南梁公社的机械厂试制成功，投入了生产。从此，我县的工业结束了手工操作的历史，广大职工群众从笨重体力劳动中解放出来了，使地方工业从生产上和装备上进入了一个新阶段。
    只要党委领导，没有办不成的事
    要迅速改变地方工业“穷”“白”的面貌，就必须坚定不移地高速度地开展技术革新和技术革命运动。而政治挂帅，加强党的领导，是保证高速度的决定因素。过去我们对这一点是认识不足的，因此，去年前半年技术革新运动的进度不很快，效果也不很大。去年11月下旬，中共晋南地委在侯马市召开了工业现场会议，给了我们极大的启示和鼓舞，一致认为只要侯马能办到的事情，我们就一定能够办到。立即决定以第一书记为首，成立技术革新和技术革命指导委员会，提出了“学侯马、赶侯马、超侯马”的口号。决心大战一个月，改变手工操作的旧面貌。运动开始，一些人说：“技术革新好是好，就是翼城办不到”，“大厂好搞，小厂办不到”，“整套的值得搞，零星的不合算”，“没有原料，自找麻烦”等等。县委也早已预料到，要把这次运动成功地搞起来，达到预定目的，关键问题在于彻底扫清前进道路上的思想障碍。所以，立即召开了全县厂矿企业小组长以上的四级干部会议，分析了大闹技术革新的有利条件，介绍了兄弟县的先进经验。在酝酿和讨论中，到会干部贴出了大字报二万七千余张，提出了合理化建议一万五千八百五十八条。经过逐项研究，采纳了合理化建议一万零六百四十三条。会后各厂矿也成立了技术革新指导组，订出了革新计划，决定了改革项目。一个有计划、有领导、有声势的技术革新和技术革命运动，便风起云涌地开展起来了；十天之后，就有六千八百二十七条合理化建议实现了，革新了工具二百九十八种，共二千二百七十一件。职工们反映：“只要党委领导，没有办不成的事。”事实也正是这样。
    群众力量能回天
    “群众力量能回天，群众智慧无穷尽”。技术革新运动掀起之后，摆在我们面前的问题是原料困难。这个问题不仅考验着轰轰烈烈的群众运动，而且也考验着领导运动的各级干部。县委在对付原料困难上，采取了“自力更生为主，必要支援为辅”的方针，提出了“比侯马白手起家、学侯马因地制宜、赶侯马因陋就简、超侯马以土代洋”的口号，发动职工总结与推广了新生的事物。因而一个“会说就动口，会作就动手，八仙过海，各显神通”的人人当能工巧匠的高潮，马上席卷全县。出席全国群英会的新胜煤矿，在“四土化”的基础上，经过五天五夜的苦战，又实现了坑上运输自动化、沟槽手摇割煤机械化、坑上坑下电灯照明化、运煤矿车化。县委抓住这个实例，一面组织参观，一面用文字通报。随之三个机械厂、二百四十名职工，经过十天战斗，革新了工具六十七种，共一百七十件，工效提高二到七倍，节约劳力七十五个，创造价值四万五千六百一十元，出现了土道轨化、筛沙机械化、锻工车间烘炉鼓风机化、汽锤化、冷锻半机械化、套丝机械化、木工车间圆盘锯化、打槽机械化、开榫凿铆机械化、大锯动力化……的新局面。这些先进单位的革新实例大大鼓舞了职工的干劲。“人尽其才、材尽其用，粗木细作，废料精制，改进操作，综合利用，以木代铁，找代用品，碎补小，小补大，千连万补都上马”的以土代洋、先土后洋的技术革新之花到处开放，原材料困难迎刃而解。皮麻鞋厂的职工，通过“三匠（皮、麻、鞋）变一匠”的方法，用烂棺材板制成了打皮机等十六种新工具，使全厂实现了机械化生产，功效提高一至十二倍，为国家节省投资六万五千七百元。建筑公司在五天内，利用废料，试制成功了打夯机、万能卷扬机等十五种、共三十件新工具，功效提高三十多倍，为国家节省投资二万三千余元。据县、社营三十一个厂矿12月一个月的统计，以铸代锻的二十一种、共一百五十件。仅以木代铁一项，就为国家节省投资八十三万九千一百元。实践证明，“以土代洋，先土后洋”两条腿走路的方针，是十分正确的。机械一厂的职工说：“听上党的话，木头作钢架，省钱又轻便，效果一样大”。
    共产主义风格充分发扬
    组织协作，互通有无，充分发扬“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的共产主义风格，将全县所有厂矿变成一个统一的整体，这是高速度发展机械化过程中解决困难的最好办法。运动开始，县委专门召开了工业、农业、商业、交通、邮电、公社和有关部门负责干部的协作会议，批判了只顾自己，不顾别人的本位主义倾向，提出全县一体、互相协作的号召，要求各个单位每个领导干部，直到每个生产小组和每个职工，都应大兴“先别人后自己，先进促后进，后进学先进”的共产主义精神。各厂矿和各部门按照县委要求，分别挂钩，建立了协作制度，确定了协作内容。这样，工农协作、工商协作、厂际协作的气氛，在全县很快形成，效果立竿见影。皮麻鞋厂等四个单位缺少动力工具，机械一厂把自己暂时用不着的四部柴油机支援了他们开展技术革新。商业部门除拿出五部动力机械外，还调剂了一部分器材，大力支援工业方面的技术革新和技术革命运动。随着协作区的划分，协作赛的开展，厂矿与厂矿、车间同车间、小组与小组之间互相扯皮的现象没有了，“留一手”的本位主义也一扫而光。取而代之的是“见困难就上，见方便就让，见经验就学，见后进就帮”的新风尚和新气象。据七个县营机械厂矿统计，12月1日到20日的二十天中，为各兄弟厂矿加工和修理的零件达七千四百二十件。机械一厂把自己的用电量压低，协助服装厂、棉纺厂等四个单位实现了机械化。这样作的好处是，既促进了技术革新运动的高速度、高标准、高质量，而且提高了广大职工的共产主义觉悟，保证了全县技术革新运动的全面胜利。加之各厂矿实行干部、工人和技术员三结合的办法，更加快了半机械化和机械化的速度。城关公社机械厂的厂长、工人、技术员，采用“三堂会审，就地操作”的方法以后，五天内创造和仿制了二十八种、五十三件新工具。机械工厂在支援农业生产的过程中，试制成功了马拉小麦收割机、追肥耧等。事实证明，通过协作和三结合的方法，不仅可以支援农业四化，而且还可以武装厂矿自己。
    轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动
    广树标兵，大插红旗，全面开展比、学、赶、超、帮的竞赛运动，是取得技术革新运动胜利的最好方法。县委在召开厂矿四级干部会议的同时，就采取“下去一把抓，回来再分家”的方法，把技术革新运动，同比、学、赶、超、帮运动统一步伐，齐头并进，互相促进。县委的技术革新委员会和竞赛委员会两位一体，由第一书记挂帅，各局的技术委员会分别设立生产、革新、协作三个小组，在各级厂矿党支部统一领导下，实行条条领导，块块包干，分兵把口，各负其责。党支部书记搞革新，抓竞赛，厂长搞协作，抓生产。确定了技术革新和三多（提的多、改的多、用的多）为内容的竞赛标准，坚持了每日排队发通报、每旬评比夺红旗，每月总结奖励的制度。同时，在大抓技术革新的过程中，把关心职工生活提到各级党委的议事日程上来，二者并重，紧密结合。这样广大职工的干劲与日俱增，英雄的劳动态度又有效地促进了技术革新运动。各企业先后派出三百九十五个能工巧匠到先进的新绛、太原等地留学取经，组织了三次大炼武、大比武、大表扬、大奖励、大动员、大总结、大参观、大学习、大宣传、大推广的现场会。比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进的竞赛，在每个厂矿都搞得热火朝天。擂台上不分父子和夫妻，你追我赶，力争上游；搞革新不分师傅和徒弟，你帮我学，共同攀登技术高峰。因此，技术革新运动万紫千红，一个月内涌现出先进标兵厂矿十一个，先进车间和小组一百四十八个，先进人物三百一十个，占工人总数的四分之一。职工歌颂技术革新运动说：“跃进花朵处处开，鲜艳夺目放光彩，只要立下凌霄志，万紫千红永不败”。
