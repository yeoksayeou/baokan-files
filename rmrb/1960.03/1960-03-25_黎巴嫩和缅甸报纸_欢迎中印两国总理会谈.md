Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 23rd: “Al Nahar” published an article today warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue with Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

“Al Nahar” said that all those who strive for peaceful coexistence were very pleased to hear the news of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, because the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Premiums will play an important part in consolidating and developing the traditional friendly relations between the two countries. The newspaper hoped that the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Premiers would produce good results.

The newspaper strongly condemned the imperialists and all international reactionaries for attempting to use the Sino-Indian border dispute to ignite the flames of international hatred, create artificial discord between the two countries, and slander China's peaceful foreign policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, March 23rd: Myanmar’s “The Nation” published an editorial today saying that the upcoming meeting between the Chinese and Indian Premiers in New Delhi to discuss the border issue between the two countries is a very pleasing event. The editorial pointed out that Myanmar and China have already resolved their border issues that had not been resolved for over a hundred years, and that the border issue between India and China could also be resolved.
