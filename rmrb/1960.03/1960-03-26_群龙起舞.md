    Group of Dragons Dancing

    The reform of agricultural tools has entered a new stage of comprehensive renovation and integrated sets. In many places, not only farming tools and water conservancy tools, but also feeding tools and cooking tools are being renovated in complete sets, from low to high, from manual operation to semi-mechanization. For example, in farming tools, from cultivation, management, and harvesting, and in feeding tools, from cutting, steaming, cooking, feeding, and manure disposal, they have gradually become integrated sets. The entire front line of agricultural tool reform is truly like a group of dragons dancing, full of vitality.
    The rapid development of the agricultural tool reform movement is the inevitable product of the continuous leap forward in agricultural production and a powerful guarantee for the sustained leap forward in agriculture. After the comprehensive implementation of the agricultural production policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development, the demand for labor in rural areas has increased. This requires further reform of tools to greatly improve labor productivity in order to solve the contradiction of labor shortage. After the universal establishment of high-yield fields and the gradual implementation of garden-style cultivation, the planning and operational continuity of agricultural production have also been greatly strengthened compared to the past. This not only requires reforming tools to improve labor efficiency but also requires the tools of each production process to be interconnected.
    Comprehensive renovation and integrated sets are a great task. The completion of this task requires close cooperation and joint efforts from all parties, but the main thing is to give full play to the talents of the broad masses of laborers and the potential of commune industries, and to solve the problem independently. The broad masses of peasants have an urgent desire to get rid of heavy manual labor and also have the power to solve this problem. The four tools in the cotton sowing process of Jiangbei Commune in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, were jointly created by several farmers, carpenters, and semi-agricultural and semi-industrial commune members, and the effect is very good. This matter once again proves that as long as the wisdom and strength of the laboring masses can be fully utilized, it is entirely possible to reform tools in sets. Of course, this does not mean that all tools must be created and invented by ourselves, and that we should not learn from others if they already exist. If such a circle is drawn, it will tie our hands and feet, waste our strength, and hinder the development of the technological innovation movement. The correct approach should be like Jiangbei Commune, which neither relies solely on others nor actively learns from others' experiences. Jiangbei Commune adopted this method for tool reform: new tools that have been created elsewhere and are suitable for local use are organized for imitation; those that are basically usable but not completely suitable are modified; and those that are needed locally but not available elsewhere are created by ourselves. Imitating and transforming new tools from other places can make full use of the achievements of tool reform in other places, quickly improve our own labor efficiency, and because it avoids repeating the old path taken by others, eliminates unnecessary labor and time waste, and facilitates the concentration of greater efforts to reform and create tools that are not available elsewhere but are needed locally. Only by closely combining these methods can our tool reform movement achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and can the tool reform movement be pushed to a new climax to meet the needs of great production development.

    群龙起舞
    张克
    农村工具改革已经进入全面革新、配套成龙的新阶段。很多地方不单是耕作工具、水利工具，而且包括饲养工具和炊事工具都正在从低到高、从手工操作到半机械化，进行着成套革新。如耕作工具中从耕种、管理、收获，饲养工具中从切割、蒸煮、喂食和粪便处理都已逐渐配套成龙，整个农村工具改革战线上真像群龙起舞，气象万千。
    农村工具改革运动的迅速发展，是农业生产连续跃进的必然产物，也是农业持续跃进的有力保证。在全面贯彻以粮为纲、全面发展的农业生产方针以后，农村对劳动力的需要日益增多，这就必须进一步改革工具，大大提高劳动生产率，才能解决劳力不足的矛盾。在普遍建立丰产方逐步实行耕作园田化以后，农业生产的计划性和操作上的连续性也比过去大大加强，这就不仅要求改革工具提高劳动效率，而且要求各个生产过程的工具互相衔接。
    全面革新，配套成龙，是一个伟大的任务。这个任务的完成，需要各方面密切协作共同努力，但主要的是发挥广大劳动群众的才智和公社工业的潜力，自力更生地去解决。广大农民有摆脱笨重手工劳动的迫切愿望，也有解决这个问题的力量。江西彭泽县江北公社棉花播种工序内的四项工具，就是由几个农民、木工、半农半工的社员联合创造的，效果很好。这件事情再一次证明，只要能够充分发挥劳动群众的智慧和力量，成套地改革工具是完全可能办到的。当然，这并不是说一切工具都要自己去创造发明，别处有了也不去学习。如果划了这样的圈子，就会束缚住自己手脚，浪费自己的力量，就会妨碍技术革新运动的开展。正确的做法应该像江北公社那样，既不单纯地依赖别人，还要积极地学习别人的经验。江北公社就是采取这种办法进行工具改革的：外地已经创造出来，又适合本地使用的新工具便组织仿制；基本能用又不完全合适的就加以改制；本地需要，外地又没有的，就自己创造。仿造和改造外地新工具，可以充分利用外地工具改革的成果，迅速提高自己的劳动效率，又因为避免了重复他人走过的老路，杜绝了不必要的劳力和时间的浪费，便于集中更大的力量去改革去创造外地还没有、本地又需要的工具。只有把这些办法紧密地结合起来，我们的工具改革运动才能做到多快好省，才能够把工具改革运动推向新高潮，满足生产大发展的需要。
