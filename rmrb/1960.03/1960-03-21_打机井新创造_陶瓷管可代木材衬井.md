Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th—The Baicheng Special District of Jilin Province is promoting the experience of the Tao'an Town People's Commune in using ceramic pipes to replace wood for lining the inner walls of machine-drilled wells, accelerating the progress of well drilling and improving the quality of machine-drilled wells.

Using ceramic pipes instead of wood lining can save five cubic meters of wood for each machine-drilled well. Moreover, ceramic has strong corrosion resistance, so the masses call these machine-drilled wells "ten-thousand-year wells." Ceramic pipes can be fired locally.

The Baicheng Special District is known as the "Eight Hundred Li Dry Sea," which has historically suffered from severe drought and very little surface water. In order to overcome drought, a machine-drilled well campaign has been widely launched in recent years. According to custom, wood is used for lining wells. Due to the lack of wood, the well-drilling campaign has been limited to some extent. After the promotion of the experience of using ceramic pipes to replace wood this time, it will greatly promote the machine-drilled well campaign, quickly drill more machine-drilled wells to fight drought; at the same time, it will save a large amount of wood for the country, save well-drilling investment for the commune, and promote the development of the commune's ceramics industry.

    打机井新创造
    陶瓷管可代木材衬井
    新华社长春20日电　吉林省白城专区推广洮安镇人民公社用陶瓷管代替木材衬机井内壁的经验，加快打井进度，提高了机井质量。
    用陶瓷管代替木衬，打一眼机井可节约五立方米木材。而且陶瓷抗蚀能力强，群众把这种机井称为“万年井”。陶瓷管可以就地烧制。
    白城专区素称“八百里旱海”，历来干旱严重，地上水很少。为了战胜干旱，几年来普遍开展了打机井运动。按照习惯，打井都用木材作衬。由于木材缺乏，打井运动受到一定限制。这次推广用陶瓷管代替木材的经验以后，将大大促进打机井运动，迅速打更多的机井抗旱；同时将为国家节约大量木材，为公社节约打井投资，并促进公社陶瓷业的发展。
