Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. The following are excerpts from the speech by Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the National Science and Technology Association, at the radio conference "Celebrating Achievements and Praising Models to Welcome March 8th, Holding High the Red Banner and Leaping Forward Together":

    Our country is in a new period of rapid development; under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our socialist cause has seen an unprecedented and even greater leap forward. The Party's call to carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution has inspired the people of the whole country, rapidly forming a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. With the heroic spirit of "women can do anything, and do it well," the broad masses of women have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and developing the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, actively throwing themselves into the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. On all production fronts and in welfare service fronts, a large number of female experts, red banner bearers, and clever girls have emerged, fully demonstrating the infinite power and wisdom of women. In the "Female Experts, Red Banner Bearers, and Clever Girls" movement carried out in various provinces, hundreds of thousands and millions of production experts have emerged. The majority of the ten thousand "March 8th Red Banner Bearers" and "March 8th Red Banner Collectives" commended at today's conference are advanced producers who have emerged in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The organizations of the Science and Technology Association are spread throughout urban and rural areas of the country, and women members account for a considerable proportion of the members of the National Science and Technology Association. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces, there are more than 500,000 women members, all of whom are active participants in scientific and technological activities and an important new force on China's scientific and technological front.

    At present, China's technical innovation and technical revolution movement is developing more widely and deeply. On the industrial front, places that employ a large amount of labor are vigorously promoting semi-mechanization and mechanization, and places that have already been mechanized are actively realizing automation and semi-automation. On the agricultural front, it is necessary to carry out technical transformation of agriculture so that agriculture can gradually achieve modernization. At the same time, in the vigorous development of poultry and livestock breeding, and in service departments such as canteens and laundries, technical innovation and tool reform movements are in full swing. Women comrades, it is hoped that you will actively participate in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, give full play to the spirit of being practical, hardworking, and clever in your respective work positions, actively participate in various scientific and technological activities, use your brains to find clever ways, realize more technical innovations, and excellently complete production tasks. At the same time, summarize and promote advanced experience and advanced technology so that existing achievements can fully blossom. Here, the women members of the Science and Technology Association and all active participants in scientific and technological activities will certainly play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridging role. Women with a certain level of education and who have mastered some science and technology should not only improve themselves on the existing basis, but also actively help others and make progress together. Our science associations at all levels regard the work of training technical cadres and popularizing scientific knowledge as their important tasks, and contribute our greatest strength to the upsurge of national mass education. We are willing to be a good assistant to the Party in this regard and help women comrades to march towards science more quickly.

    Our country needs thousands upon thousands of scientific and technological talents with a certain amount of knowledge. It is hoped that you will hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, work hard to learn science and engage in technology, and make progress every day. Science is not mysterious. Science comes from labor practice. As long as you have great ambitions, continue to break superstitions, liberate your minds, and work boldly and conscientiously, and conduct research, you will surely conquer the scientific fortress and climb the peak of science.

    要树立雄心大志　做科学技术主人
    茅以升在首都“三八”广播大会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社5日讯　全国科学技术协会副主席茅以升在“庆功表模迎三八、高举红旗齐跃进”广播大会上的讲话，摘要如下：
    我们国家正处在一个飞跃发展的新时期；在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们社会主义事业出现了史无前例的更大跃进。党提出开展技术革命、文化革命的号召，鼓舞着全国人民，迅速地形成了一个技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。广大妇女群众以“妇女什么也能干，什么也干得好”的英雄气概，热烈响应了党和毛主席的号召，破除迷信、解放思想，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，积极投入了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。在各个生产战线和生活福利战线上，涌现出大批的女能手、红旗手、巧姑娘，充分显示了妇女的无穷力量和智慧。在各省开展的“女能手、红旗手、巧姑娘”运动中，都有几十万、几百万的生产能手涌现出来。今天大会表扬的一万个“三八红旗手”和“三八红旗集体”中绝大部分都是在技术革新和技术革命运动中涌现出来的先进生产者。科学技术协会的组织遍布全国城乡，在全国科协的会员中，妇女会员就占了相当比例。据十个省不完全的统计，共有妇女会员五十多万名，这些都是科学技术活动中的积极分子，是我国科学技术战线上的重要的新生力量。
    在当前，我国的技术革新和技术革命运动正在更加广泛、更加深入的发展。在工业战线上，占用劳动力很多的地方，正在大搞半机械化、机械化，已经机械化的地方，正在积极实现自动化、半自动化。在农业战线上，要对农业实行技术改造，使农业逐步实现现代化。同时，在大搞家禽家畜的饲养中，在食堂、洗衣等服务部门中，都热火朝天地进行着技术革新和工具改革运动。妇女同志们，希望你们积极投入以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，在各自的工作岗位上，充分发挥实干苦干加巧干的精神，积极参加各种科学技术活动，开动脑筋找窍门，实现更多的技术革新，出色完成生产任务。同时，总结和推广先进经验和先进技术，使得已有的成果全面开花。在这里，科学技术协会的妇女会员以及一切科学技术活动中的积极分子，一定会发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。具有一定文化修养和掌握了一些科学技术的妇女，不仅自己要在现有基础上提高一步，而且应该积极地帮助别人，大家共同跃进。我们科协的各地组织，都把培养技术干部和普及科学知识的工作当作自己的重要任务，在全国大办业余教育的高潮中贡献出我们的最大力量。我们愿在这方面当好党的助手，帮助妇女同志们更快地向科学进军。
    我们的国家需要千千万万个具有一定知识的科学技术人才，希望你们高高举起毛泽东思想的红旗，努力学科学搞技术，天天迈进。科学并不是神秘的，科学出于劳动实践，只要立下雄心壮志，继续不断地破除迷信，解放思想，大胆地踏实地进行工作，进行研究，就一定会攻克科学堡垒，攀上科学的高峰。
