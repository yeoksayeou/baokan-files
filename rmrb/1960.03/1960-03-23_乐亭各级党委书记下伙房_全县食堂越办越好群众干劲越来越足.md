Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 22nd: Party secretaries at all levels in Leting County, Hebei Province, go down to the kitchens and vigorously cultivate "experimental plots" for canteens, resulting in better and better canteens throughout the county.

Currently, 97.6% of the rural population in the county eat in the people's commune's public canteens. In order to improve the canteens and promote continued leaps in production, the Leting County Party Committee grasped both production and daily life. The county's first secretary first cultivated a canteen "experimental plot" in the Cuiweinian Production Team of the Yangezhuang Commune. Subsequently, party organization secretaries in all thirty-five communes, two hundred and twenty-eight brigades, and over one thousand four hundred villages throughout the county also went down to the kitchens to cultivate "experimental plots." Many brigade cadres moved to the canteens to eat with the commune members, and many of them also served as administrators and cooks. After the party secretaries at all levels went down to the kitchens, the vast number of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and grassroots cadres further cared about the canteens and became even more motivated to run the canteens well.

After the party secretaries at all levels went to the canteens, they first helped administrators and cooks strengthen grain management and vigorously develop non-staple food production. Now, all canteens in the county implement planned grain use, and 81% of the canteens implement methods of rationing grain per person, eating with tickets, and returning savings to the individual. One hundred and fifty brigades have independently established grain warehouses and strictly implement grain management and receipt systems. After taking these measures, not only was grain saved, but the commune members were also satisfied with their meals. At the same time, most canteens raised pigs and chickens, and planted spring vegetables, which not only improved the meals but also increased the canteen's income.

Significant progress has also been made in the reform of canteen cooking equipment. Currently, the county has manufactured, reformed, and promoted eleven types of major cooking equipment such as vegetable cutting machines, dishwashing machines, and universal steamers. The main operating processes of one hundred and fifty-one canteens have been semi-mechanized.

Under the leadership of the Party, public canteens have implemented the class line and established canteen management committees with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone. Party secretaries at all levels have specifically helped canteens establish and improve various democratic management systems.

Now, canteens are not only places for collective meals but have also become centers for political and cultural entertainment activities for commune members. According to statistics from more than two thousand seven hundred canteens, nearly one hundred thousand slogans and propaganda posters have been posted in the dining halls. More than two thousand four hundred evaluation boards and glory platforms have been set up. More than three thousand seven hundred dining hall reading groups have also been established, and more than two thousand propagandists and reporters regularly conduct propaganda and mobilization work on current affairs policies and central tasks in the canteens. Commune members said: "When the secretary goes down to the kitchen, not only is the food delicious, but you learn everywhere, and everyone is happy."

    乐亭各级党委书记下伙房
    全县食堂越办越好群众干劲越来越足
    新华社天津22日电　河北乐亭县各级党委书记下伙房，大搞食堂“试验田”，全县食堂越办越好。
    现在，全县97．6％的农村人口都已在人民公社的公共食堂吃饭。为了把食堂办得更好，促进生产继续跃进，中共乐亭县委一手抓生产，一手抓生活，县委第一书记首先在阎各庄公社崔魏埝生产队搞了食堂“试验田”，随后，全县三十五个公社、二百二十八个大队和一千四百多个村的党组织书记，也都先后下伙房搞“试验田”。许多大队干部搬到食堂与社员一同吃饭，其中许多人还兼任了管理员和伙食员，各级党委书记下伙房以后，广大党员、团员、基层干部也都进一步关心食堂，更加干劲十足地要把食堂办好。
    各级党委书记下到食堂之后，都首先帮助管理员和炊事人员加强了口粮管理和大搞副食品生产。现在，全县各食堂都实行了计划用粮，有81％的食堂实行了以人定量、凭票吃饭、节约归己的办法，有一百五十个大队单独建立了口粮仓库，严格执行口粮管理和领取制度。采取这些办法后，既节省了粮食，社员们又吃得满意。同时，多数食堂都养了猪、鸡，种了春菜，不仅改善了伙食，还增加了食堂收入。
    食堂炊具改革也有了很大成绩。现在全县已制造、改革和推广了切菜机、刷碗器、万能屉等主要炊具十一种，有一百五十一个食堂的主要操作过程已经实现了半机械化。
    各公共食堂在党的领导下，贯彻了阶级路线，成立了以贫农、下中农为骨干的食堂管理委员会。各级党委书记都具体帮助食堂建立和健全了各项民主管理制度。
    现在，食堂不仅是集体吃饭的场合，而且成了社员政治活动和文化娱乐活动的中心。据两千七百多个食堂统计，饭厅中共张贴标语、宣传画近十万张，设评比榜，光荣台二千四百多处，还建立了三千七百多个饭厅读报组，有两万多名宣传员、报告员经常在食堂进行时事政策及中心工作的宣传鼓动工作。社员们说：“书记下伙房，不光饭菜香，处处长学问，人人喜洋洋。”（附图片）
