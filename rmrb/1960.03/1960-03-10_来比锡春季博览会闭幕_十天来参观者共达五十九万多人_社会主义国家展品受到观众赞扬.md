Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. The Leipzig Spring Fair closed on the evening of the 8th. Over 590,000 visitors from eighty countries around the world visited this large-scale fair over the ten days, and the exhibits from socialist countries aroused warm praise from the visitors.

The host of the fair, the German Democratic Republic, showcased at the fair the significant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in developing the national economy during the first year (1959) of the Seven-Year Plan. Many exhibits had signs reading "New Product," and many of these were also noted as creations of "Socialist Labor Collectives." Many industrial products, especially heavy machinery, optical instruments, and chemical products, received high praise from visitors. The large "telecommunication cable braiding machine" is one of the 1,100 new designs or improvements in the machinery industry of the German Democratic Republic this year. Audiences were very interested in this new world-class product, which is dozens of meters long and rotates at forty revolutions per minute.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, visited the fair. During his visit, he said that the fair showed that the industry of the German Democratic Republic, especially the machine-building industry, has made a huge leap forward through socialist reconstruction.

This year's Leipzig Spring Fair once again proved that it is a center for East-West trade. The German Democratic Republic reached trade agreements worth 4.23 billion marks with the countries participating in the fair, an increase of 23.9% compared to the trade volume of the Spring Fair last year.

The fair was also a meeting place for people from all walks of life in the East and West. A total of fifty-two countries participated in the exhibition. All socialist countries sent government delegations to participate. Eighteen Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and most capitalist countries in Europe had official, semi-official, or well-known social figures visit the fair, and the leaders of the Party and government of the German Democratic Republic conducted extensive contacts with them.

    今年的来比锡春季博览会再次证明，它是东西方贸易的一个中心。德意志民主共和国在这次博览会期间和参加博览会的国家达成四十二亿三千万马克的贸易协议，较去年春季博览会的贸易额增加23．9％。
    博览会也是东西方各方面人士会见的一个场所。在这次博览会上，共有五十二个国家参加展出。各个社会主义国家都派有政府代表团参加。十八个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家、欧洲的大部分资本主义国家都有官方、半官方或著名社会人士参观了博览会，德意志民主共和国的党和政府领导人和他们进行了广泛的接触。
