Kashgar's Cultural and Educational Undertakings Develop Rapidly to Cultivate Talent for Socialist Construction

    (Our dispatch) The cultural and educational undertakings in Kashgar Prefecture, southern Xinjiang, are developing rapidly. At present, the prefecture has developed to forty-seven secondary schools, including senior high schools, junior high schools, and normal schools, and seven hundred and sixty-five primary schools. From Bachu and Yuepu Lake counties on the edge of the Tarim Desert to Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau, every county now has a middle school. Primary school education has been popularized throughout the region. On average, each management area in the eighty-four people's communes has one or several primary schools. The total number of primary school students is 3.36 times that of the time of liberation, and the total number of middle school students is 47 times that of the time of liberation. Since 1958, Kashgar Prefecture has launched a large-scale literacy campaign. So far, six literacy-free communes have emerged in the region, accounting for about 65% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in the region, and about 445,300 people have been lifted out of illiteracy. On the basis of the great achievements in literacy, counties have successively established 5,214 spare-time primary and secondary schools. More than 176,000 young and middle-aged people are studying here.
    Before liberation, the cultural and educational undertakings in Kashgar Prefecture were very backward. At that time, there were only two middle schools and eighty-nine primary schools. Poverty forced 65.4% of school-age children to drop out of school. Among the young and middle-aged people in the vast rural areas, illiteracy accounted for 93%. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government vigorously supported the cultural and educational undertakings of ethnic minorities, adopted all means to train ethnic teachers, increased cultural and educational funding, and successively trained more than 6,500 primary school teachers and 1,778 middle school teachers, and established more than 53,000 square meters of school buildings. In the past ten years, more than 10,900 students have graduated from secondary schools, most of whom have reached the countryside and become a new force on the rural cultural front.
    The development of education has also promoted the development of other cultural undertakings. In addition to adding Xinhua Bookstore outlets in various counties (cities) in the region, there are also 41 community-run bookstores. Many communes have established libraries, and production brigades have established reading rooms. The number of reading groups in the region has increased to 14,890. In addition, rural amateur opera troupes, film projection stations, slide projection stations, and amateur song and dance troupes have also developed greatly. There are 573 amateur song and dance troupes in the people's communes, and 1,476 rural clubs.

    为社会主义建设培养人材
    喀什文化教育事业发展迅速
    本报讯　南疆喀什专区的文化教育事业发展迅速。目前全专区的高级中学、初级中学和师范学校等中等学校已发展到四十七所，小学七百六十五所。从塔里木大沙漠边缘的巴楚、岳普湖等县直到帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县，已经做到县县有中学。全区的小学教育已经普及，八十四个人民公社中，平均每个管理区都有一所到几所小学校。小学生总人数为解放时的三点三六倍，中学生总人数为解放时的四十七倍。喀什专区从1958年开始，展开了大规模的扫盲工作，到目前为止，全区出现了六个无盲公社，占全区青壮年总数65％左右，约四十四万五千三百多人已经摘掉了文盲的帽子。在扫盲获得巨大成绩的基础上，各县先后兴办了五千二百一十四个业余小学和业余中学。有十七万六千多名青壮年在这里学习。
    喀什专区解放前文化教育事业十分落后，当时只有两所中学，八十九所小学。贫穷迫使65．4％的学龄儿童失学。在广大农村的青壮年中，文盲占到了93％，解放以后，党和人民政府大力扶持少数民族文化教育事业，采取一切办法培养民族师资，增加文化教育经费，先后培养了六千五百多名小学教员和一千七百七十八名中学教员，建立了五万三千多平方米的校舍。十年来，中等学校毕业学生达一万零九百多人，其中大部分到达农村，成为农村文化战线上一支新生力量。
    教育事业的发展，也促进了其他文化事业的发展。全区各县（市）除增设新华书店门市部外，还出现了四十一处社办书店，很多公社都成立了图书馆，生产大队建立了阅览室，全专区读报组发展到了一万四千八百九十个。此外，农村业余剧团、电影放映站、幻灯站，业余歌舞剧团也有很大发展，各人民公社的业余歌舞团就有五百七十三个，农村俱乐部有一千四百七十六座。
