    Time Mistake
    In the People's Daily's February 21st, first-page editorial, "Comprehensively Arrange the Livelihood of Commune Members," the fourth paragraph mentions, "As early as the First Revolutionary Civil War period, Comrade Mao Zedong told us to 'care about the lives of the masses and pay attention to methods of work.'" Here, the period when this work was published is incorrect. It should be "As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War period..." The same error also appears in the March 16th, second-page short article, "Good Methods to Help Residents' Dining Halls." We hope to strengthen verification work.

    时间弄错了
    人民日报2月21日一版社论“全面安排社员生活”，第四段谈到“早在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志就告诉我们要‘关心群众生活，注意工作方法’。”这里把这篇著作发表的时期写错了，应为“早在第二次国内革命战争时期……”。3月16日二版短文“帮助居民食堂的好办法”中也有同样错误。希望加强核对工作。
