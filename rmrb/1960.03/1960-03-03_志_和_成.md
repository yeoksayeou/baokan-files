"Where there is a will, there is a way," is an old Chinese saying. With ambition, there is a main direction for doing things, and it is possible to achieve something. The greater the ambition, the more things will be accomplished. To undertake the great cause of socialism and communism, we must establish lofty ambitions.

However, "ambition" is not equal to "achievement." Turning "ambition" into "achievement" requires a process of arduous struggle. Having "ambition" is an ideal, a possibility. To turn this ideal, this possibility, into reality, we must go through hard work, deeply understand objective things, and create conditions to ultimately achieve "success." The female communist Su Wenhong, with her great ambition and indomitable spirit, after practice and learning, created the "particle size analyzer," which accurately calculated the Yangtze River's silt, making a huge contribution to the socialist motherland.

"Ambition" is also a reflection of class ideology. The ambition of the bourgeoisie lies in creating greater profits for the individual; the ambition of the proletariat lies in striving to realize the liberation of all mankind and the great cause of socialism and communism. Therefore, whether "ambition" can be transformed into "achievement" depends not only on individual hard work, but also on the specific historical and social environment. In the socialist motherland, there is the leadership and support of the Communist Party, as well as the cooperation and assistance of all aspects, which can promote its success. In the process of Su Wenhong's creation and invention, she encountered numerous difficulties. Who supported her? The Party. Who encouraged her? Also the Party. Who sent her to study theoretical knowledge? Also the Party. In this way, her "ambition" was transformed into "achievement."

In the great Mao Zedong era, under the leadership and support of the great Chinese Communist Party, a broad world has been opened up for the realization of the socialist ambitions of millions of heroic sons and daughters. Truly, "the sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly." We must, like Su Wenhong, establish the lofty ambition to realize the great cause of socialism and communism, carry forward the spirit of overcoming difficulties, and transform grand ambitions into a beautiful reality!

### “志”和“成”

    “志”和“成”
    “有志者，事竟成”，这是我国的“老话”。有了志，办起事情来，就有了主攻方向，就可能干出一番事业。志越大，办的事情就会越多。办社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业，就要树立雄心大志。
    但是，“志”还不等于“成”。要把“志”变为“成”，必须经过艰苦奋斗的过程。有“志”，是一个理想，是可能性。要把这个理想、这个可能性变为现实，就要经过艰苦的努力，深刻地认识客观事物，创造条件，才能克抵于“成”。女共产党员苏温洪，立下了雄心大志，又具有百折不挠的精神，经过实践和学习，创造了“粒径计”，结果算清了长江的泥沙账，为社会主义祖国作出了巨大贡献。
    “志”，又是阶级意识形态的反映。资产阶级的志愿，在于创造更大的利润，是为了个人；无产阶级的志愿，在于努力实现全人类的解放事业，实现社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业。因此，“志”能否变为“成”，除了个人艰苦奋斗外，离不开特定的历史和社会的环境。在社会主义祖国，就有共产党的领导和支持，以及各方面的协作和帮助，就能促其成功。苏温洪在创造发明的过程中，碰到了重重困难，支持她的是谁？是党。鼓舞她的又是谁？也是党。派她去学习理论知识的是谁？也是党。这样，她的“志”，才变为“成”。
    在伟大的毛泽东时代，在伟大的中国共产党领导和支持下，给千百万英雄儿女的社会主义志愿的实现，开辟了广阔的天地。真是“海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”。我们要像苏温洪那样，立下为实现社会主义和共产主义伟大事业的雄心大志，发扬战胜困难的精神，把宏大的志愿，变为美好的现实！
