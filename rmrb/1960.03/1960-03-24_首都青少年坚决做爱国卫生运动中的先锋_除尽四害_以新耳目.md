Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The "Capital Youth Patriotic Health Campaign Swearing-in Rally" held today at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace called on the city's youth, under the leadership of Party and Youth League organizations, to summon greater revolutionary vigor and resolutely act as pioneers in the Patriotic Health Campaign, joining the people of the capital in immediately launching a new upsurge in the Patriotic Health Campaign that is both vigorous and grand.

This rally was jointly convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Committee of the Communist Youth League of Organizations Directly Under the Central Committee, and the Committee of the Communist Youth League of Central Government Organs, among other units. More than 4,000 people attended the rally, including active members of the youth in health work and cadres of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers.

Chen Kehan, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Secretariat of the CPC, spoke at the meeting. He said that our health work is a great people's health work and an important component of the cultural revolution. Doing a good job in health and sports can promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, promote the technical revolution and cultural revolution, and accelerate socialist construction. Chen Kehan pointed out that it is wrong to oppose health work to production and learning; the more intense production and learning are, the more we must pay attention to hygiene. We must thoroughly eliminate the bad habits of neglecting hygiene in the old society, change customs, and develop new communist moral habits and lifestyles that love labor, pay attention to hygiene, and care about public interests. After outlining the tremendous achievements made in the capital's health work in recent years, Chen Kehan said that in the future, we must continue to extensively mobilize the masses, carry out publicity on a large scale, vigorously conduct competitions and comparisons, create a powerful mass movement, further improve environmental sanitation, improve the sanitation of all collective welfare undertakings, eliminate breeding conditions for mosquitoes and flies, eliminate the four pests of rats, bedbugs, mosquitoes, and flies, and eradicate infectious diseases, so as to achieve cleanliness everywhere and health for everyone. Chen Kehan asked the capital's youth to: participate in one physical exercise each, develop good hygiene habits, and become models and pacesetters for sports and hygiene; actively participate in the Patriotic Health Campaign, publicize it to the broad masses of people, popularize hygiene knowledge, and make everyone take pride in hygiene and feel ashamed of unhygienic behavior. Everyone should hold fly swatters or other tools, eliminate the four pests on a large scale, and make great innovations in eliminating the four pests; boldly create, research, and promote various simple and effective methods; and help the masses do a good job in the sanitation of collective welfare undertakings such as canteens and nurseries, public health work, and environmental sanitation. Chen Kehan said that the capital's youth should immediately join the movement, achieve results in a short period of time, and make the capital look new and become one of the most hygienic cities in the country.

Wang Wei, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said at the meeting that in the past few years, the people and youth of the whole country, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party and Chairman Mao, have carried out a mass Patriotic Health Campaign and achieved great results. Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene have become a good social atmosphere in our country. At present, our country's socialist construction is leaping forward continuously at an unprecedented speed. The youth of the whole country should closely follow the development of the situation, stand at the forefront of this year's health campaign, and make everyone contribute and everyone make meritorious contributions.

Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, also encouraged the capital's youth at the meeting to organize various shock teams to fight for forty days, so that the Patriotic Health Campaign can achieve new results and welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day.

Subsequently, advanced units and activists in the Patriotic Health Campaign from industry, agriculture, commerce, academia, and the military in Beijing spoke at the meeting, and they all expressed their response to the call of the conference. Feng Xiaomo, Deputy Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the Third General Machinery Factory, which has won the Health Red Flag twice in a row, said at the meeting: In the past two years, because the entire factory has achieved three cleanness standards, four absences, and six-sided brightness, the health level of employees has been greatly improved, and the incidence rate has decreased significantly, decreasing by 44.1% in 1958 compared to 1957, and by 33.4% in 1959 compared to 1958. They are determined to make all young employees active members in eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, exercising, and eliminating diseases.

Fu Rongguang, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Youth League of the Wenquan Production Brigade of the Yongfeng People's Commune in Haidian District, assured at the meeting that they would immediately mobilize the youth to launch a pupa-digging campaign and vigorously carry out physical exercise activities at the same time. Huang Xiaozhen, representative of the Young Pioneers of Beimencang Primary School, Tan Bin, a young man from the street, Liu Baoling, representative of the Hongxing Dumpling Shop Youth League Group, Si Qin, representative of Beijing Medical College, as well as representatives of the youth of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison and the Youth League Committee of Central State Organs, who have received nine commendations and awards at the national and Beijing levels for two consecutive years, also spoke at the meeting, expressing their firm response to the call of the Party.

The conference finally announced the decision of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League on organizing the city's youth to play a greater active role in the Patriotic Health Campaign.

    共青团中央书记处书记王伟在会上说，几年来，全国人民和青少年，在党和毛主席的领导和鼓舞下，开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动，获得了巨大的成绩。除四害讲卫生，已经成为我国良好的社会风气。目前，我国社会主义建设正以史无前例的高速度，持续向前跃进，全国青少年应紧紧跟上形势发展，在今年卫生运动中站在卫生运动的前列，做到人人有贡献、个个立功劳。
    北京市副市长王昆仑也在会上勉励首都青少年组织各种突击队大战四十天，使爱国卫生运动取得崭新的成绩，迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    接着，北京市工、农、商、学、兵等方面的爱国卫生运动中的先进单位和积极分子在会上发言，他们一致表示响应大会的号召。连续两次获得卫生红旗的第三通用机械厂团委副书记冯孝墨在会上说：两年来由于全厂做到了三洁、四无、六面光，使职工健康水平大大提高，发病率显著下降，1958年比1957年下降44．1％，1959年比1958年下降33．4％。他们决心要使全体青年职工都成为除四害、讲卫生、练身体、灭疾病的积极分子。
    海淀区永丰人民公社温泉生产大队共青团总支书记傅荣光在会上保证要立即发动青少年展开挖蛹运动，同时，大力开展体育锻炼活动。连续两年来获得全国和北京市九次表扬和奖励的北门仓小学少先队代表黄小箴、街道青年谭斌、鸿兴饺子铺团小组代表刘宝玲、北京医学院代表斯勤以及北京驻军某部青年代表、中央国家机关团委会等单位的代表也都在会上讲话，表示坚决响应党的号召。
