Editor's Note

	It's Better to Take Action Early
	The temperature was relatively high last winter and this spring, and most areas have been dry since the beginning of spring, making it easy for pests and diseases to occur and develop. All localities should, like Jiangsu Province, recognize the situation and organize forces as early as possible to carry out widespread prevention and control, which is extremely important for ensuring a bumper harvest of summer crops this year.
	The timing and location of agricultural pests are often complex. On the one hand, we must vigorously develop forecasting stations. On the other hand, we must also rely on the masses to detect pests at any time, report them in time, and eliminate them in time. Jiangsu Province has more than 57,000 informants, which has created a vast network for eliminating pests. Jiangsu Province's practice of building indigenous pesticides on a large scale, based on the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," is also worth promoting.
	The availability of highly effective therapeutic agents for wheat rust is encouraging news. Since aminosulfonic acid is a new drug for the prevention and control of wheat rust, it is hoped that relevant departments will vigorously organize recycling, accelerate allocation, and that agricultural science departments will provide specific guidance to farmers on its use.

    早动手为强
    去冬今春气温较高，入春以来大部地区干旱，病虫害很易发生和发展。各地应该像江苏省那样，认清形势，及早组织力量，普遍进行防治，这对保证今年夏收作物丰收，有极其重要的关系。
    农业害虫发生时间、出现地点往往是很复杂的，一方面我们既要大力发展预测站，另一方面还必须依靠群众，随时发现虫害，及时报告、及时消灭。江苏全省设有情报员五万七千多人，这就给消灭害虫布下了天罗地网。江苏省还根据“土洋并举”方针大造土农药，也是值得提倡的作法。
    麦锈病有了高效治疗剂，这是振奋人心的消息。由于对氨基苯磺酸在防治小麦锈病上是一种新药，希望有关部门大力组织回收、加速调拨，农业科学部门要具体指导农民使用。
