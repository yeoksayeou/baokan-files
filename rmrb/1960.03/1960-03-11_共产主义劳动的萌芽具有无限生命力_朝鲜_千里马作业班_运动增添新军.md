Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the "Chollima Workteam" movement has been underway among the Korean working people for a year, and this new bud of communist labor has grown and is continuing to develop. Currently, more than 3,000 production teams with over 50,000 workers are participating in the movement to win the title of "Chollima Workteam".

By the end of February this year, the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea had awarded the title of "Chollima Workteam" to 228 advanced production teams.

This movement has expanded to department stores, barbershops, hotels, hospitals, and theaters. Doctors, photographers, sculptors, and singers have also joined the movement.

The "Chollima Workteam" movement was initiated by the furnace production team of the Kangson Steel Works in South Pyongan Province.

Participants in this movement compete with each other not only in fulfilling production plans, but also in cultural and technical studies, and in cultivating a communist style and morality in work and at home. Through the struggle to raise communist consciousness, they have increased their sense of responsibility in production, bravely overcome difficulties, and strengthened comradely cooperation in their work.

The high speed of socialist economic construction in northern Korea is mainly due to their leading role in technical innovation in production and in the realization of the technical and cultural revolution. All workers participating in the "Chollima Workteam" movement have excellently completed the targets they guaranteed to the state and the people.

Today, the "Chollima Workteam" movement is developing towards improving quality. Through advanced workteams and workshops helping backward workteams and workshops, neighboring factories cooperate with each other so that everyone can become a winner in the socialist competition.

The initiator of this new movement is Kil Hak-sil, the leader of the "Chollima Workteam" at the Pyongyang Silk Mill. She voluntarily took over the most backward workteam in the factory and, within a few months, raised the team to an advanced level.

In the "Chollima Workteam" movement, some "Chollima Workshops" and "Chollima Factories" have emerged. (Attached picture)

    共产主义劳动的萌芽具有无限生命力
    朝鲜“千里马作业班”运动增添新军
    目前已有二百二十八个先进生产队获得光荣称号
    运动已扩展到百货公司、理发店、旅馆、医院和戏院
    新华社平壤9日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：“千里马作业班”运动在朝鲜劳动人民中开展一年以来，这种共产主义劳动的新的萌芽已经成长并且正在继续发展。现在，已经有三千多个生产队的五万多劳动人民参加了争取“千里马作业班”称号的运动。
    到今年2月底，朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会已经授予二百二十八个先进生产队“千里马作业班”的称号。
    这个运动已扩展到百货公司、理发店、旅馆、医院和戏院。医生、摄影师、雕塑家和歌唱家也参加了这个运动。
    “千里马作业班”运动是平安南道降仙炼钢厂熔炉生产队倡议的。
    这个运动的参加者，不仅在执行生产计划方面，而且在文化和技术学习方面以及培养在工作中和家庭中的共产主义作风和道德方面，互相竞赛。通过提高共产主义觉悟的斗争，他们提高了生产中的责任感，勇敢地克服困难和加强工作中的同志协作。
    朝鲜北部社会主义经济建设的高速度发展，主要由于他们在生产技术革新方面以及实现技术和文化革命方面起了带头作用。所有参加“千里马作业班”运动的工人都出色地完成了他们向国家和人民保证的指标。
    今天，“千里马作业班”运动正在向提高质量方面发展。通过各先进工作队和先进车间帮助落后的工作队和车间，邻近的工厂之间互相进行协作，以便大家都成为社会主义竞赛的优胜者。
    这个新的运动的倡议者是平壤丝织厂“千里马作业班”班长吉学实。她自动接管了工厂中最落后的作业班，并且在几个月内，把这个小队提高到先进的水平。
    在“千里马作业班”运动中，已出现了一些“千里马车间”和“千里马工厂”。（附图片）
