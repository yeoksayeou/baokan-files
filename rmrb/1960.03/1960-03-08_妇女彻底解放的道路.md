The Road to Complete Emancipation of Women
郑治洲

Fifty years ago, the International Socialist Women's Congress, based on the suggestion of Clara Zetkin, a prominent female activist in the international workers' movement, designated March 8th as International Working Women's Day to strengthen the solidarity and liberation struggle of international working women. This marked the combination of the women's liberation movement with the proletarian revolutionary movement and the strengthening of the proletarian revolutionary movement, foreshadowing the brilliant prospect of the inevitable victory of the women's liberation movement.

Since the emergence of class antagonism in human society, working women have been subjected to dual oppression. They are not only oppressed by the exploiting classes, but also occupy an unequal position with men in society and within the family. Originally, in primitive communes, women, like men, were equal members of society. The only difference between them and men was the social division of labor, not the difference in social status. With the emergence of class society, with the emergence of private ownership of the means of production and the patriarchal family based on private ownership, men became the "patriarchs" who controlled the economic power of the family, and women retreated to the humble position of domestic slaves. As Engels said: “In the ancient communistic household, which comprised several pairs and their children, the administration of the household, entrusted to the women, was just as much a public, a socially necessary industry as the procuring of food by the men. With the patriarchal family, and still more with the single monogamous family, a change came. Household management lost its public character. It no longer concerned society. It became a private service; the wife became the head servant, excluded from all participation in social production.” (The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, p. 70) "The first class antagonism that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression coincides with the enslavement of the female sex by the male." (The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, pp. 62-63) In class society, women belonging to different classes have essentially different positions in society due to their different class status. Although women of the exploiting classes are in a subordinate position to men in the families of the exploiting classes, they, together with the men of their class, jointly oppress the working people and live a life of leisure. Determined by their class nature, their attitude towards the working people is completely consistent with that of the men of their class. Women among the working people, together with men, are subjected to the enslavement and exploitation of the exploiting classes. Within the working people, there is also discrimination against and oppression of women, which is due to the influence of the ideology of the exploiting classes and the fact that men generally occupy a dominant position in the family economy. The development of human history shows that the social root cause of the oppression of working women is the private ownership of the means of production, and the most fundamental oppression they suffer is class oppression. Therefore, Marxists have always believed that if women are to be liberated, class oppression must be eliminated and private ownership of the means of production must be abolished; and that the women's liberation movement is an important component of the entire proletarian revolutionary movement, and without the active participation of the broad masses of women, the proletarian revolutionary cause cannot succeed.

The practice of the international communist movement has powerfully proved and will continue to prove that the path of women's liberation guided by Marxism is completely correct. Now, in socialist countries that account for one-third of the world's population, working women have been liberated due to the victory of the proletarian revolution, and they, together with all the working people, have become the masters of the new society. The bourgeoisie has also talked about equality between men and women, which played a certain progressive role during the bourgeois revolution against feudal rule. However, the bourgeoisie has no intention of touching the foundation of private ownership, but only uses the capitalist form of exploitation to replace the feudal form of exploitation, and only puts a capitalist yoke on the necks of both male and female workers. The bourgeoisie's so-called equality between men and women is essentially to allow proletarian women to be exploited by capitalists as unlimitedly as men. As for equality between men and women within the bourgeoisie, it only means replacing complex feudal ties with naked monetary relations. The fact that capitalist countries allow some bourgeois women to participate in politics is only an embellishment of bourgeois democracy and has nothing to do with the liberation of the broad masses of working women. In fact, although the bourgeoisie has been in power in many countries for more than a hundred years, it still has not given women a completely equal position with men in law, and women in general are subject to various unreasonable restrictions in employment, education, and participation in elections. The status of working women is even more miserable. In those countries, the bourgeoisie also aggravates the exploitation of working women by means of unequal pay for equal work between men and women. As Lenin said: "Capitalism cannot even completely achieve formal equality (legal equality, the 'equality' of the well-fed and the hungry, the propertied and the propertyless). One of the most obvious manifestations of this incompleteness is inequality between men and women." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 374) The broad masses of working women who still live in the capitalist world can no longer endure the situation they are in, and they are becoming more and more awakened and united, actively participating in the struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace, strive for national independence, and strive for social progress, and are striving to win and defend women's rights. Although women in capitalist countries still have to go through arduous, complex, tortuous struggles on the road to liberation, it can be determined that with the development and strengthening of the proletarian revolutionary forces in various countries and the victory of the proletarian revolution, they will surely win their liberation. This is the inevitable trend of historical development.

Following the Marxist theory of women's liberation, the Chinese Communist Party has always closely integrated leading the liberation movement of Chinese women with leading the revolutionary and construction undertakings of the entire Chinese people. In various historical periods of revolution and construction, the Party has formulated the policies and tasks of the women's movement based on the general tasks of revolution and construction at that time and the special requirements of the masses of women, and correctly led the struggle for women's liberation. Every victory of our country's revolution and construction is inseparable from the active participation of the broad masses of women; and every victory of the revolution and every step forward in the cause of socialist construction has moved the women's liberation movement forward.

In old China, the oppression of the broad masses of women by the feudal system was particularly deep. Comrade Mao Zedong once profoundly analyzed the oppressed situation of the masses of women in old China. He said: "Chinese men are generally subject to the control of three systematic powers, namely: (1) the state system (political power) from one country, one province, one county to one township; (2) the family system (clan power) from ancestral temples, branch temples to parents; (3) the underworld system from the Yama, the City God to the Land God, and the fairy system from the Jade Emperor to various gods and monsters – collectively referred to as the ghost and god system (divine power). As for women, in addition to being subject to the above three powers, they are also subject to the control of men (husband power). These four powers – political power, clan power, divine power, and husband power – represent the entire feudal patriarchal ideology and system, and are the four extremely large ropes that bind the Chinese people, especially the peasants."
（"Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume I, p. 33）The invasion of imperialism into China further aggravated the suffering of Chinese women. Imperialism colluded with feudal forces to exploit the Chinese working people extremely cruelly. In particular, the many wars of imperialist aggression against our country caused countless Chinese people to lose their families and lives, and women were brutally trampled on. The broad masses of Chinese women particularly longed for liberation. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they actively participated in the democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. In the long revolutionary war and various arduous and complex revolutionary struggles, they demonstrated the spirit of hard work, perseverance, heroic sacrifice, and made brilliant contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. The victory of the Chinese democratic revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China ended the history of Chinese women being enslaved and oppressed for thousands of years, and the masses of women, together with all the working people, became the masters of the new China. With the victory of a series of democratic reform movements such as land reform and the implementation of the Marriage Law, the feudal shackles on women left over from the old society were lifted. The state clearly stipulates through the Constitution and many other laws that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of life, such as political, economic, cultural, social, and family life.

The complete victory of the democratic revolution is a great victory for the Chinese people and a great victory for the women's liberation movement in China. However, when private ownership of the means of production still exists in society, and when women are still confined to the small circle of the family and excluded from social production activities, they are still in a position of not completely equal to men in fact. In this sense, they have not been completely liberated. To completely liberate women, it is necessary to eliminate private ownership of the means of production, realize the socialization of housework, and allow women to participate extensively in social labor. After studying the history of the development of the whole human society, Engels correctly pointed out: "The emancipation of women becomes possible only when woman can take part in production on a large, social scale, and domestic work no longer claims anything but an insignificant amount of her time." ("The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State", p. 70) Lenin also said: "As long as women are engaged in housework, their status will inevitably be limited. To completely liberate women and to make them truly equal to men, there must be public economy, and women must participate in common productive labor." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 25) He also said: "Only where they begin a wholesale reorganisation of petty domestic work into large-scale socialist economy can there be any real emancipation of women, any real communism." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 29, p. 390) Under the leadership of the Party, Chinese women were not satisfied with the results brought about by the victory of the democratic revolution. After completing the democratic revolution, they actively participated in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and continued to move towards the goal of complete liberation of women pointed out by the proletarian revolutionary teachers.

In the new historical period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In order to build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production activities." He also pointed out: "True equality between men and women can only be achieved in the process of socialist transformation of the entire society." ("The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" Volume I, p. 357) With the deepening of the socialist revolution and the development of socialist construction, the important significance of these instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong became increasingly clear.

Under the guidance of the Party's general line for the transition period, our country successfully completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in 1956, and abolished private ownership of the means of production. From then on, the social root cause of the oppression of women for thousands of years was eradicated. In the rural areas of the country, due to the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the individual economy based on households was transformed into a socialist collective economy. In agricultural production cooperatives, women, like men, are members and owners of the collective property of the agricultural production cooperative. More than half of the women with labor power participated in the collective labor of agricultural production cooperatives. Compared with the era of individual economy, the opportunities for the broad masses of women to participate in various social and political activities and to learn cultural technology have greatly increased. The traditional patriarchal system has been fundamentally shaken. The status of women in society and in the family has been greatly improved.

Immediately after the successful completion of the socialist revolution on the economic front, Chinese women, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. On the basis of the comprehensive victory of the socialist revolution, in 1958, a great leap forward situation appeared on all fronts of socialist construction in our country, and the people's communes were realized in the rural areas of the country. This situation requires the broad masses of women to universally participate in social labor, and opens up extremely broad space for them to participate in social labor. At the same time, under the education and encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the great leap forward situation, the broad masses of women liberated their minds, raised their awareness, and also urgently demanded to participate in social labor and devote themselves to the hot construction upsurge. In order to meet the needs of rapid production development and the urgent demands of the broad masses, especially the masses of women, collective welfare undertakings were widely held in the rural areas of the country and the streets of many cities, fundamentally solving the contradiction between women's participation in social production and taking care of housework, thereby further liberating women's labor force. According to preliminary statistics at the end of 1959, the number of people participating in canteens in rural areas across the country accounted for an average of about 73% of the total rural population, and provinces with the most widespread development, such as Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan, accounted for more than 90%. Rural nurseries and kindergartens generally received about 70% of the children who needed to be admitted. In the city streets, collective welfare undertakings are also developing rapidly and vigorously. According to preliminary statistics from ten provinces and regions such as Sichuan and Hebei, there are more than 20,000 urban resident canteens, with more than 4 million people eating there; there are more than 36,000 civil-run childcare organizations in urban streets, receiving 1.4 million children. Since 1958, the number of women participating in labor in rural areas has increased unprecedentedly. According to statistics in 1959, the number of women regularly attending work in various regions across the country generally reached 90%. Women have become a main force on the agricultural production front. Women's important role in industrial production is also very significant. Since the Great Leap Forward, the number of female employees has greatly increased, from more than 3 million in 1957 to more than 8 million in 1959. Not only do female employees account for a large proportion in light industrial sectors such as the textile industry, but also in industrial sectors such as steel, construction, and petroleum, where few women participated in the past, now a large number of women are working side by side with men. In addition, there are many urban housewives who have participated in street industrial production and various social service undertakings. According to statistics from eleven cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Chengdu in 1959, more than 380,000 women participated in street industrial production, accounting for 76% of the total number of employees in street industries in these cities. Among them, the proportion of women in Beijing is the highest, reaching 95%. The widespread participation of the masses of women in social labor has not only contributed to socialist construction and improved the life of the family, but also profoundly changed their spiritual outlook. They have improved their socialist and communist awareness, broken the past sense of inferiority and timidity, and promoted a new style of daring to think, speak, and do. They are full of vitality and soaring enthusiasm in labor, and thousands of heroic model figures have emerged on various fronts. For these reasons, their social status has been further improved.

Since 1958, the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the establishment and development of people's communes have brought China's women's liberation cause into a new stage of development.

During the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, residents of many city streets launched a movement to vigorously run industries and social service undertakings. This movement is booming and is now developing more and more widely. This is a matter of great significance. It points out a very good way to accelerate the construction of new socialist cities, and has a huge role in organizing urban housewives to participate in social labor and changing their lifestyles. The new socialist city is built on the economic foundation of large-scale industry and public ownership, which requires the people of the city to comprehensively organize political, economic, cultural and other aspects of life. In the past, although people who produced, worked, and studied in factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools were highly organized, there were still a large number of street residents, mainly housewives, who had not been organized in terms of production and life. The large-scale establishment of street industries and social service undertakings provides very favorable conditions for solving this problem. Street industry is an assistant to large-scale industry, the production objects are diverse, the business methods are flexible, and even the length of time to participate in production can vary according to the specific situation of each person, which makes it particularly easy to organize housewives to participate in production. The universal establishment of public canteens, nurseries, life service stations, and other institutions in urban streets can make housework more and more widely socialized. The life service station is a new type of social service organization. The service content ranges from dismantling, washing, sewing, and repairing, cleaning rooms to purchasing goods and taking care of patients. Almost all household chores can be handled on behalf of others. This not only liberates a large number of women's labor forces, but also allows the broad masses of female employees to not have to worry about household chores, and wholeheartedly do a good job in production. In addition to work, they can also have more time to study and participate in other social activities. In some urban industrial and mining areas, due to the adjustment of employee dormitories according to factories, workshops, types of work, and shifts, a new type of residential area is being formed that comprehensively organizes employee production, life, and political and cultural education, which is also greatly conducive to organizing employee families to participate in social labor. While organizing housewives to participate in social labor, many cities have also widely organized them to carry out political study and cultural and technical study in order to meet their urgent desire to study. Now, in the city, you can see everywhere the new atmosphere of "everyone labors, every household has no idle people", and the new communist customs are further greatly promoted.

The establishment of the people's commune is another transformation with great historical significance in our country's society, and it has extremely far-reaching significance for the realization of the complete liberation of women in our country. It is a very good organizational form for the complete liberation of women in our country.

The role of the people's commune in promoting the complete liberation of women can be clearly seen from the following aspects:

First, the original agricultural production cooperatives generally had a small production scale and were mainly engaged in agriculture and some sideline occupations, while the people's communes have the characteristics of being large in scale and public in nature, and can organize manpower and material resources on a larger scale to carry out agricultural basic construction and gradually realize the semi-mechanization, mechanization, and electrification of production; at the same time, the people's communes implement the policy of combining industry and agriculture and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery, and expand the scope of production activities unprecedentedly. Therefore, the people's communes have significantly greater advantages than the original agricultural cooperatives in rationally arranging women's labor force and fully exerting the role of women.

Second, after rural cooperativization, production has been collectivized, but consumption is still based on the family, and there are few collective welfare undertakings, mainly some temporary busy season canteens and nurseries, etc. Women still have to bear heavy housework, which hinders them from regularly and peacefully participating in collective production labor and various social activities. This situation has fundamentally changed after the establishment of the people's commune. The people's commune is not only the organizer of collective production, but also the organizer of collective life. It can universally hold collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc., so that women can be liberated from housework.

Third, the people's commune currently implements a distribution system that combines wages and supply, on the one hand, it provides the most important and most reliable social insurance for every male and female worker, and at the same time, the wages are paid to each worker, and women can receive their own wages. In the past, although women could participate in the labor of agricultural cooperatives to earn work points, the distribution was carried out on a household basis, and the income of each household was generally controlled by the parents, so the influence of the traditional patriarchal system remained. Now, women not only participate in social labor, but also can obtain a completely independent position economically, so the remnants of the patriarchal system are further broken.

Fourth, the people's commune is a basic-level social organization that combines government and commune and combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, which greatly facilitates the broad masses of women to participate in social and political activities and learn cultural technology, helps them improve their political awareness and cultural and technical level, so that many women can quickly get rid of the past backward and closed state, so as to adapt to the needs of the ever-developing socialist construction. Not only that, the people's commune is also a powerful weapon for accelerating socialist construction, and is the best form for our country's rural areas to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and to transition from socialism to communism in the future. In a communist society, women will fully realize complete liberation. At that time, the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of the masses of women and the entire people will be greatly improved, and they will all become laborers with a high level of culture, science and technology.

Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, Chinese women have embarked on the victorious road to realize complete liberation and are striding forward towards their great goal.

    妇女彻底解放的道路
    郑治洲
    距今五十年前，国际社会主义妇女大会，根据国际工人运动杰出的女活动家蔡特金的建议，为了加强国际劳动妇女的团结和解放斗争，确定每年3月8日为国际劳动妇女节。这标志着妇女解放运动同无产阶级革命运动的结合和无产阶级革命运动的壮大，预示着妇女解放运动必然胜利的光辉前景。
    自从人类社会出现阶级对立以来，劳动妇女就一直受着双重的压迫，她们不但受着剥削阶级的压迫，而且在社会上和家庭内都处于同男子不平等的地位。本来，在原始公社里，妇女同男子一样都是社会上平等的一员，她们和男子之间，只有社会分工的不同，而没有社会地位的差别。随着阶级社会的出现，随着生产资料私有制和以私有制为基础的家长制家庭的产生，男子成为掌握家庭经济大权的“家长”，妇女退居卑微的家庭奴婢的地位。正如恩格斯所说的：“在包括许多对夫妇和他们子女的古代的共产制的家庭经济中，委托给妇女去处理的家务，正如男子获得食物一样，同为一种公众的、社会所必需的职业。随着家长制家庭底发生，尤其是随着一夫一妻制个体家庭底发生，形势就改变了。家事的处理丧失了自己的公众的性质。它不再涉及社会了。它变成为一种私人的服务；妻成为主要的家庭女仆”。（“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”第70页）“头一个在历史上出现的阶级对立，是与个体婚制下夫妻间对抗底发展相一致的，而头一个阶级的压迫是与男性对女性的奴役相一致的。”（“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”62—63页）在阶级社会里，属于不同阶级的妇女，她们在社会上的地位，由于阶级地位的不同而有本质的不同。剥削阶级的妇女虽然在剥削阶级的家庭中处于依附男子的地位，但是她们同本阶级的男子一起，共同压迫劳动人民，过着不劳而获的生活。由于阶级本性所决定，她们对待劳动人民的态度，是和本阶级的男子完全一致的。劳动人民中的妇女和男子一起，受着剥削阶级的奴役和剥削。在劳动人民内部，也存在着歧视妇女、压迫妇女的现象，这是由于受了剥削阶级的思想影响和男子一般在家庭经济中居于支配地位。人类历史的发展表明：劳动妇女受压迫的社会根源是生产资料私有制，她们所受的压迫，最基本的是阶级压迫。因此，马克思主义者从来就认为，妇女要得到解放，必须消灭阶级压迫，废除生产资料私有制；并且认为，劳动妇女的解放运动是整个无产阶级革命运动的一个重要组成部分，没有广大妇女群众的积极参加，无产阶级革命事业就不可能获得成功。
    国际共产主义运动的实践，有力地证明了并将继续证明马克思主义所指引的妇女解放的道路，是完全正确的。现在，在占全世界三分之一人口的社会主义国家，由于无产阶级革命的胜利，劳动妇女已经获得了解放，她们同全体劳动人民一起，成了新社会的主人。资产阶级也谈过男女平等，这在反对封建统治的资产阶级革命时期，曾经有过一定的进步作用。但是，资产阶级一点也不想触动私有制的根基，只是用资本主义的剥削形式代替封建的剥削形式，只是在男女劳动者的脖子上换上一副资本主义的枷锁。资产阶级的所谓男女平等，实质上就是要无产阶级的妇女和男人同样受资本家的无限制的剥削。至于在资产阶级内部，所谓男女平等，那只是意味着用赤条条的金钱关系来代替复杂的封建羁绊。资本主义国家允许一些资产阶级妇女参政，那也只是资产阶级民主的一种点缀，同广大劳动妇女的解放是毫不相干的。事实上，尽管资产阶级在许多国家当政了一百多年之久，到现在仍然没有给予妇女在法律上同男子完全平等的地位，一般妇女在就业、受教育、参加选举等方面要受到种种无理的限制。劳动妇女的地位更为悲惨。在那些国家里，资产阶级还通过男女同工不同酬的办法，加重对劳动妇女的剥削。正如列宁所说的：“资本主义连形式上的平等（法律上的平等，饱食者和挨饿者、有产者和无产者的‘平等’）也不能彻底作到。这种不彻底性的最鲜明表现之一，就是男女间的不平等。”（“列宁全集”三十卷，第374页）目前还生活在资本主义世界的广大劳动妇女，已经愈来愈不能再忍受她们所处的境遇，她们正一天天更加觉醒起来，更加团结起来，积极参加各国人民保卫和平、争取民族独立、争取社会进步的斗争，并为争取和维护妇女的权利而努力斗争。资本主义国家的妇女，尽管在争取解放的道路上还要经历艰苦复杂、迂回曲折的斗争，但是，可以断定：随着各国无产阶级革命力量的发展壮大和无产阶级革命的胜利，她们必将争得自己的解放。这是历史发展的必然趋势。
    中国共产党遵照马克思主义关于妇女解放的理论，一贯把领导中国妇女的解放运动同领导整个中国人民的革命和建设事业紧密地结合在一起。在革命和建设的各个历史时期，党都根据着当时革命和建设的总任务和妇女群众的特殊要求，制订了妇女运动的方针和任务，正确地领导了妇女的解放斗争。我国革命和建设的每一胜利，都是和广大妇女群众的积极参加分不开的；而革命的每一次胜利和社会主义建设事业的每一步进展，又使妇女解放运动向前迈进一步。
    在旧中国，封建制度对于广大妇女群众的压迫是特别深重的。关于旧中国妇女群众受压迫的状况，毛泽东同志曾经深刻地分析过。他说：“中国的男子，普通要受三种有系统的权力的支配，即：（一）由一国、一省、一县以至一乡的国家系统（政权）；（二）由宗祠、支祠以至家长的家族系统（族权）；（三）由阎罗天子、城隍庙王以至土地菩萨的阴间系统以及由玉皇上帝以至各种神怪的神仙系统——总称之为鬼神系统（神权）。至于女子，除受上述三种权力的支配以外，还受男子的支配（夫权）。这四种权力——政权、族权、神权、夫权，代表了全部封建宗法的思想和制度，是束缚中国人民特别是农民的四条极大的绳索。”
   （“毛泽东选集”第一卷，第33页）帝国主义侵入中国，更加重了中国妇女所受的苦难。帝国主义和封建势力勾结起来，极其残酷地剥削中国劳动人民。特别是帝国主义侵略我国的多次战争，使无数我国人民家破人亡，妇女惨遭蹂躏。广大的中国妇女特别渴望获得解放。在中国共产党的领导下，她们积极参加了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的民主革命。在长期的革命战争和各种艰苦复杂的革命斗争中，她们表现了艰苦卓绝、英勇牺牲的精神，对中国人民的解放事业作出了辉煌的贡献。中国民主革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，结束了几千年来中国妇女被奴役被压迫的历史，妇女群众和全体劳动人民一起成了新中国的主人。随着土地改革、贯彻婚姻法等一系列民主改革运动的胜利，旧社会遗留下来的对于妇女的封建束缚得到了解除。国家通过宪法和其他许多法令明确地规定：妇女在政治、经济、文化、社会和家庭等各个方面的生活中，享有同男子平等的权利。
    民主革命的彻底胜利，是中国人民的伟大胜利，也是中国妇女解放运动的伟大胜利。但是，当社会上还存在着生产资料私有制，当妇女还被束缚在家庭的小圈子里而被排斥在社会生产活动之外的时候，她们事实上还处在同男子不完全平等的地位，从这个意义上说，她们还没有得到彻底解放。要彻底解放妇女，就必须消灭生产资料私有制，实现家务劳动社会化，让妇女广泛参加社会劳动。恩格斯在研究了整个人类社会发展的历史之后，正确地指出：“妇女底解放，须以一切女性底重行参加社会劳动为其头一个先决条件；而要达到这一点，又要求个体家庭不复再是社会经济的单位。”（“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”第70页）列宁也说过：“妇女要是忙于家务，她们的地位总不免要受到限制。要彻底解放妇女，要使她们与男子真正平等，就必须有公共经济，必须让妇女参加共同的生产劳动。”（“列宁全集”三十卷，第25页）他还说：“只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”（“列宁全集”二十九卷，第390页）在党的领导下，中国妇女并没有满足于民主革命的胜利所带来的成果，在完成了民主革命后，她们又积极参加了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，朝着无产阶级革命导师所指出的妇女彻底解放的目标继续前进。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新的历史时期，毛泽东同志指出：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。”他并指出：“真正的男女平等，只有在整个社会的社会主义改造过程中才能实现。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”上册，第357页）随着社会主义革命的深入和社会主义建设的发展，毛泽东同志这些指示的重要意义，就看得愈来愈清楚了。
    在党的过渡时期总路线的指引下，我们国家于1956年胜利地完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，废除了生产资料私有制，从此，几千年来妇女受压迫的社会根源就从根拔掉了。在全国农村，由于实现了农业合作化，以一家一户为单位的个体经济改造成了社会主义的集体经济。在农业生产合作社中，妇女和男子一样都是社员，都是农业合作社的集体财产的所有者。半数以上的有劳动力的妇女参加了农业合作社的集体劳动。比起个体经济时代来，广大妇女参加各种社会政治活动和学习文化技术的机会大大增加了。传统的家长制已经根本动摇。妇女在社会上和家庭里的地位大大提高了。
    紧接着完成了经济战线上的社会主义革命之后，我国妇女和全国人民一道，在党的领导下，又取得了政治思想战线上的社会主义革命的伟大胜利。在社会主义革命全面胜利的基础上，1958年，我国社会主义建设各个战线上出现了大跃进的形势，全国农村实现了人民公社化。这种形势，要求广大妇女普遍参加社会劳动，并且为她们参加社会劳动开辟了极其广阔的天地。同时，广大妇女在党的社会主义建设总路线和大跃进形势的教育、鼓舞下，解放了思想，提高了觉悟，也迫切要求参加社会劳动，投身到热火朝天的建设高潮中去。适应生产迅速发展的需要和广大群众特别是妇女群众的迫切要求，集体福利事业在全国农村和许多城市的街道广泛地举办起来，从根本上解决了妇女参加社会生产和料理家务的矛盾，从而进一步解放了妇女的劳动力。全国各地农村参加食堂的人数，据1959年底初步统计，平均约占农村总人数的73％，发展最普遍的如河南、湖南、四川、云南等省，已占90％以上。农村托儿所和幼儿园一般接收了需要入托儿童的70％左右。在城市街道中，集体福利事业也正在迅速蓬勃地发展。据四川、河北等十个省区的初步统计，城市居民食堂有二万多个，入伙人数四百多万人；城市街道民办托儿组织有三万六千多个，收托儿童一百四十万人。1958年以来，农村妇女参加劳动的人数空前增长。在全国各个地区，妇女经常出勤人数根据1959年统计，一般达到90％。妇女成了农业生产战线上的一支主力军。妇女在工业生产中的重要作用也很显著。大跃进以来，女职工的人数大大增加，由1957年的三百多万人猛增到1959年的八百多万人。不但在纺织工业等轻工业部门中女职工占有很大的比例，而且，在过去很少有妇女参加的钢铁、建筑、石油等工业部门中，现在都有大批妇女和男子并肩劳动。此外，还有许许多多的城市家庭妇女参加了街道工业生产和各种社会服务事业。据北京、天津、武汉、成都等十一个城市1959年统计，参加街道工业生产的妇女有三十八万多人，占这些城市街道工业职工总数的76％。其中，北京市妇女所占的比例最高，达到95％。妇女群众广泛参加社会劳动，不仅为社会主义建设贡献了力量，改善了家庭的生活，并且也使她们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。她们提高了社会主义和共产主义的觉悟，打破了过去那种自卑畏缩心理，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的新风格，在劳动中生气勃勃，干劲冲天，在各个战线上涌现出成千成万的英雄模范人物。由于这些原因，她们的社会地位更加提高了。
    1958年以来，社会主义建设的大跃进和人民公社的建立和发展，使我国妇女解放事业进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    在社会主义建设的大跃进中，许多城市的街道居民掀起了大办工业和社会服务事业的运动。这个运动方兴未艾，目前正日益广泛地发展起来。这是一件具有重大意义的事情，它指出了一条加速建设社会主义新城市的很好途径，对于组织城市家庭妇女参加社会劳动和改变她们的生活方式有着巨大的作用。社会主义的新城市是建立在大工业和全民所有制的经济基础上的，它要求城市人民把政治、经济、文化等各方面的生活全面地组织起来。过去，虽然在工厂、企业、机关、学校中生产、工作、学习的人们，已经高度地组织起来了，但是还有为数众多的街道居民，主要是家庭妇女，她们还没有从生产上和生活上组织起来。街道工业和社会服务事业的大量举办，就为解决这个问题提供了十分有利的条件。街道工业是大工业的助手，生产对象多种多样，经营方式灵活，甚至参加生产的时间长短也可以因各人的具体情况而有所不同，这就特别便于组织家庭妇女参加生产。在城市街道普遍建立公共食堂、托儿所、生活服务站等机构，可以使家务劳动愈来愈广泛地社会化。生活服务站是一种新型的社会服务组织，服务内容从拆洗缝补、清扫房间到代购物品、照顾病人，几乎所有家务琐事都可以代办。这样不但能解放大量的妇女劳动力，而且使广大女职工不必再为家务琐事操心，一心一意搞好生产，在工作之余，也可以有更多的时间进行学习和参加其他社会活动。在一些城市工矿区，由于按工厂、车间、工种、班次调整了职工宿舍，正在形成全面组织职工生产、生活和进行政治、文化教育的新型居民点，这也大大有利于组织职工家属参加社会劳动。许多城市在组织家庭妇女参加社会劳动的同时，为了满足她们要求学习的迫切愿望，还广泛地组织了她们进行政治学习和文化技术学习。现在在城市里，到处可以看到“人人都劳动，户户无闲人”的新气象，共产主义的新风尚进一步大大地发扬起来。
    人民公社的建立，是我国社会又一次具有伟大历史意义的变革，对于实现我国妇女的彻底解放，有着极其深远的意义。它是我国妇女彻底解放的很好组织形式。
    人民公社对于促进妇女彻底解放的作用，从以下几个方面可以看得很清楚：
    一、原来的农业生产合作社一般生产规模较小，主要只是从事农业和一些副业，而人民公社却具有一大二公的特点，能够在更大的范围内组织人力物力，进行农业的基本建设，逐步实现生产的半机械化、机械化和电气化；同时，人民公社实行工农业并举和农林牧副渔五业全面发展的方针，空前地扩大了生产活动的范围。因此，人民公社在合理安排妇女劳动力和充分发挥妇女的作用方面，比起原来的农业合作社有显著的更大的优越性。
    二、农村合作化以后，生产已经集体化了，但是消费仍然是以家庭为单位，集体福利事业很少，主要是一些临时性的农忙食堂和托儿所等，妇女还要担负繁重的家务劳动，这就妨碍她们经常地安心地参加集体生产劳动和各种社会活动。这种情况，在人民公社建立以后，有了根本的改变。人民公社不仅是集体生产的组织者，也是集体生活的组织者。它能够普遍地举办公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业，使妇女从家务劳动中解放出来。
    三、人民公社目前实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，一方面给每一个男女劳动者提供了最重要的最可靠的社会保险，同时，工资发到每个劳动者手里，妇女可以自己领到工资。过去，妇女虽然可以参加农业合作社的劳动挣工分，但是那时分配是以家庭为单位进行的，各个家庭的收入一般都由家长支配，这样，传统的家长制的影响还残留着。现在，妇女不但参加了社会劳动，而且在经济上可以取得完全独立的地位，因而就进一步破除了家长制的残余。
    四、人民公社是政社合一和工农商学兵相结合的社会基层组织，这就大大便利了广大妇女群众参加社会政治活动和学习文化技术，帮助她们提高政治觉悟和文化技术水平，使许多妇女能够迅速摆脱过去那种落后闭塞的状态，以适应社会主义建设日益发展的需要。不仅如此，人民公社还是加速社会主义建设的强有力的武器，是我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制和在将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好形式。在共产主义社会里，妇女将完全实现彻底的解放，那时，妇女群众与全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质都将极大地提高，都将成为具有高度的文化、科学技术水平的劳动者。
    我国妇女在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，已经走上了实现彻底解放的胜利道路，正朝着自己的伟大目标阔步前进。
