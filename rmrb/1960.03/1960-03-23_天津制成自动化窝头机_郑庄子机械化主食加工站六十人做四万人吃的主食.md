Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, employees of the Tianjin Municipal Food and Welfare Company created an automated cornbread machine. This automated cornbread machine only requires one person to operate and can produce 6,000 cornbread cakes per hour. Using the automated cornbread machine to steam cornbread increases work efficiency by 186 times compared to manual operation, saving a large amount of labor and greatly reducing the labor intensity of cooking staff.

The automated cornbread machine was successfully trial-produced by Teng Zijing, a member of the Technology and Infrastructure Department of the company and a Communist Party member, under the leadership of the Party, relying closely on the masses, along with more than 20 employees. The new machine has been tested three times with good results.

This automated cornbread machine operates continuously. Corn kernels are placed in the grain hopper on the machine. When the switch is turned on, the corn kernels enter a steel mill via an elevator to be ground into fine powder. After automatic sieving, they enter a spiral mixing machine via an elevator. An automatic water supply pipe adds water to mix the dough. Then, a dough distributor distributes the mixed dough into a row of cornbread molds, which are automatically punched with holes by an automatic hole-punching machine and then automatically enter the steaming box. After about ten minutes, boxes of steamed cornbread are poured out from the other end of the machine, and the cornbread molds automatically return.

More than 80% of the components of the automatic cornbread machine created by the employees of the Tianjin Municipal Food and Welfare Company are made of wood, resulting in low manufacturing costs. The entire machine occupies only 1.5 square meters of floor space. Therefore, it is suitable for large canteens in rural people's communes, factories, and streets. Many representatives from people's communes and factories have visited the machine and praised it enthusiastically.

According to the Hebei Daily, the Zhengzhuangzi district store in Hedong District, Tianjin, has established a large-scale mechanized staple food processing station. Sixty staff members produce a variety of staple foods sufficient for 40,000 people to eat at the same time. The staple foods are diverse, high-quality, low-priced, and hygienic, and are very popular among the masses. This mechanized staple food processing station has created favorable conditions for better organizing the people's economic life.

Currently, this staple food processing station has taken over all the staple food production for 269 residents' canteens, 34 schools, and organization canteens in the entire Zhengzhuangzi area. The entire station can produce 169 kinds of staple foods. A five-pound steam boiler can steam 120 pounds of steamed buns every eight minutes. The automatic oven can bake a batch of sesame cakes or pot cakes every four minutes, producing 7,000 pounds of staple food per day. The cornmeal cakes and sesame sauce sesame cakes baked by the oven are golden brown and crispy. The noodles cut by the noodle-cutting machine are thin and even.

    天津制成自动化窝头机
    郑庄子机械化主食加工站六十人做四万人吃的主食
    据新华社天津电　天津市饮食福利公司职工在技术革新和技术革命运动中，创造出一台自动化窝头机。这台自动化窝头机，只要一个人照料，每小时能制成六千个窝头。利用自动化窝头机蒸窝头，工作效率比人工操作高一百八十六倍，不仅节省了大批劳动力，还大大减轻了炊事人员的劳动强度。
    自动化窝头机是这个公司技术基建科科员、共产党员滕子敬，在党的领导下紧紧依靠群众，同二十多名职工一起试制成功的。新机器经过三次开车试验，效果良好。
    这台自动化窝头机是连续作业的，把玉米粒放在机器上的粮斗里，一扭开关，玉米粒就通过升降机进入钢磨磨成细粉，经过自动过筛，再通过升降机进入螺旋合面机，由自动给水管渗水把面合好后，再由拨面器把合好的面拨在一排窝头模子里，经过自动打眼机打眼，自动进入蒸箱，约十分钟的时间，一箱箱蒸熟了的窝头就从机器的另一端倒出，窝头模子又自动回去。
    天津市饮食福利公司职工创造的这台自动窝头机，80％以上的部件是用木材制成的，制造成本较低。整个机器只占一点五平方米地面。因此，它适用于农村人民公社、工厂和街道的大型食堂。许多人民公社和工厂的代表参观了这台机器以后，都热烈赞扬。
    据河北日报消息　天津市河东区郑庄子地区商店建立起一座机械化的大型主食加工站，六十个工作人员做出足够四万人同时食用的各种主食，而且主食的花样多、质量高、收费低、卫生好，很受群众欢迎。这座机械化主食加工站给更好地组织人民经济生活，创造了有利条件。
    现在，这个主食加工站已经把郑庄子全街二百六十九个居民食堂、三十四个学校、机关食堂的主食全部包起来。全站能生产一百六十九种主食。一个五磅气的蒸汽锅炉，每八分钟可蒸一百二十斤馒头。自动烤炉，每四分钟可烤一炉烧饼或锅饼，一天能烤出主食品七千斤，由烤炉烤出的玉米面饼和麻酱烧饼，焦黄香脆。用切面机切出的面条，又细又匀。
