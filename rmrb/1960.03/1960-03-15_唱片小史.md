	A Short History of Records
	The history of records is only a little over seventy years. The first record was born in 1888. At that time, singers and speakers had to stay close to the microphone of the recorder to speak and sing in order to make the vibrating diaphragm vibrate and engrave spiral sound patterns of uneven depth and thickness on the record. If it is unfolded, it is a small groove about half a kilometer long. Initially, the sound patterns were etched on wax plates, and each wax record could be played five or six times.
	The first records were single-sided recordings, with the record factory's trademark and content summary pasted on the back. Double-sided single-hole records began to appear in 1903.
	Because wax records could not be played many times, soft rubber, hard rubber, glass, and ceramics were tried to make records. Later, it was discovered that shellac (glue refined from the hard shells of beetles) was the most suitable. Making records with shellac is better than using any natural substance. Scientists have tried using steel to make records, and the results show that they are damaged twenty times faster than shellac records. This is because shellac is elastic and tough, and has extremely high resistance to the pressure of the stylus. However, because shellac records contain some mineral fillers in addition to shellac, they not only emit tearing noises under the stylus pressure but also produce granular hard objects. Therefore, shellac records are not very ideal either.
	Since the advent of plastics, scientists have begun to use plastics to make records, achieving very good results. The invention of plastic records not only made it possible to record sound patterns more densely and extend playing time, but also reduced the weight of the records, making them easier to carry. Shellac records have a speed of 78 revolutions per minute, while plastic records have a speed of 33 1/3 revolutions per minute.
	Since the invention of multi-speed electric record players, record technology has been improved accordingly, and even denser and slower-turning records have appeared in the world. On January 17th of this year, the Beijing Evening News reported that the China Record Factory had successfully trial-produced dense, slow-turning records that can play for up to one hundred and fifty-three minutes at a speed of 16 2/3 revolutions per minute, and is also trial-producing 8 1/9 rpm records that can play for about five hours.
	In recent years, stereophonic electric record players have also been invented. The pickup heads of these record players are equipped with two styluses that are fixedly spaced apart, and the records have double spiral grooves. The sound produced by this type of record player is more realistic and can be considered a revolution in the record industry.

    唱片小史
    唱片的历史不过七十多年。第一张唱片诞生于1888年。那时歌唱家和演说家必须紧挨着录音器的话筒说唱才能使震动膜振动而刻划在唱片上深浅粗细不匀的螺旋状音纹。如果把它展开是条长约半公里的小沟。最初把音纹划在蜡板上，每个蜡制唱片可唱五、六次。
    最初的唱片是单面录音的，反面贴上唱片工厂的商标和内容提要。双面录音的单孔唱片是在1903年开始出现的。
    因蜡制唱片不能唱许多次，曾用软橡胶、硬橡胶、玻璃、陶瓷等试制唱片，后来发觉用虫胶（甲虫的硬壳炼熬的胶）最适宜。用虫胶制唱片比用任何一种天然物质都好。科学家曾试用钢材做唱片，结果比虫胶唱片损坏的时间要快二十倍，这是因为虫胶富弹力而又坚韧，对唱针的抗压力极大的缘故。但由于虫胶唱片中除虫胶外还有一些矿物质等填充物，在针的刺压下不仅发出撕裂声，还产生颗粒状硬物，因此虫胶唱片也不是很理想的。
    自从塑料问世后，科学家开始用塑料制唱片，达到了很好的效果。塑料唱片的发明不仅使录制音纹更为紧密和放唱时间延长，并且减轻了唱片体重，便于携带。虫胶唱片转速为每分钟78转，塑料唱片速度为每分钟33 1/3转。
    自多种转数电唱机发明后，唱片技术随之改进，更为密纹慢转的唱片出现于世。今年1月17日北京晚报曾报道：中国唱片厂试制成功可放唱长达一百五十三分钟、转速为每分钟16 2/3转的密纹慢转唱片，并且正在试制一种放唱达五小时左右的8 1/9转唱片。
    近年来立体声电唱机又发明出来，这种唱机的唱机头上装有彼此相隔固定距离的两颗唱针，唱片为双螺旋纹。这种唱机发出来的声音更为逼真，可算是唱片工业上的革命。
