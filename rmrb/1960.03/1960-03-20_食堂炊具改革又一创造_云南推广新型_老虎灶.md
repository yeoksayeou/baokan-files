Another Creation in Canteen Cookware Reform
Yunnan Promotes New Type of "Tiger Stove"
The benefits of the "Tiger Stove" are: saves more than 60% of fuel; has strong firepower and multiple burners, allowing simultaneous cooking of rice and dishes, saving cooking time and reducing kitchen staff by 23%; can burn any fuel and can be widely promoted in cities and rural areas.

Kunming, March 19th (reported by this newspaper) - Yunnan Province is vigorously promoting a new type of tiger stove that can save a significant amount of fuel and improve the efficiency of kitchen labor. According to investigations, the use of this new type of tiger stove can save 60% to 80% of coal compared to old stoves, and reduce kitchen staff by about 23%. Relevant leading departments believe that the creation and promotion of the new type of tiger stove is an important treasure in the current reform of canteen cooking tools.

This new type of tiger stove was created by the kitchen staff of the Chengguan District Canteen in Kaiyuan County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture. Based on the original dragon stove, bagasse stove, and rice husk stove, they collectively researched and improved the stove by integrating the advantages of various stove types. The characteristics of the new tiger stove are: one fire door with three cooking pots, a large and deep ash pit (1.45 meters long, 6 centimeters wide, and 1.7 meters deep), long and wide furnace bars (1.2 meters long, 2 centimeters wide, and sloped), and a tall chimney (about 7 to 9 meters high). Building a new type of tiger stove requires 2,300 bricks (or adobe), 2 cubic meters of river sand, 1,000 kilograms of lime, 20 long clay furnace bars, 6 short ones, as well as steaming pots and gas transfer pipes, with a total cost (including materials and labor) of more than 200 yuan.

The results of promoting this new type of tiger stove in various parts of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture prove that it has the following major advantages: First, it uses less fuel but has strong firepower. For example, the nine public canteens in Kaiyuan County's Chengguan District generally serve 400 to 700 people each. Before using the tiger stove, these nine canteens burned 125 tons of coal per month, equivalent to 28 kilograms of coal per person per month. After switching to the tiger stove, they only burned 21.5 tons per month, equivalent to 4.8 kilograms of coal per person per month. Comparing before and after, the tiger stove saves 82.8% of coal compared to the old stove. Because fuel is saved, a significant amount of transportation capacity and labor for transporting fuel is also saved. Second, because the firepower is very strong, with several burners on one stove, equipped with three cooking pots, rice cooking, water boiling, and stir-frying can be done simultaneously, saving cooking time. In the past, the nine public canteens in Kaiyuan County's Chengguan District generally needed four to five hours to cook a meal. The kitchen staff had to get up at three or four o'clock in the morning every day and were busy all day long; sometimes, due to poor planning, they could not guarantee timely meals, affecting the commune members' work. After switching to the tiger stove, each meal only takes two and a half hours to prepare. Commune members reflected that in the past, people waited for food, but now food waits for people. The kitchen staff can also spend four to five hours a day studying culture and politics, and their rest time is also guaranteed. Third, because steaming rice, stir-frying, and boiling water can be done simultaneously, the cooks can use the time while steaming rice to stir-fry and boil water, which saves more labor than the old stove. Before switching to the tiger stove, the nine canteens in Kaiyuan County's Chengguan District had 67 cooks, with one cook preparing meals for an average of 68 people. After switching to the tiger stove, the number of cooks was reduced to 51, with one cook able to prepare meals for an average of 87 people. The nine canteens saved a total of 16 laborers, who participated in other production. Fourth, this stove can burn any fuel, and can be promoted in cities, rural areas, institutions, schools, or military units. Sawdust, weeds, dead branches, fallen leaves, crushed coal, lump coal, etc., anything that can burn can be used. The masses praised it, saying, "The tiger stove is not picky, it can eat anything!"

After this major reform of cooking utensils appeared, the relevant leading departments in Yunnan Province immediately sent a working group to conduct investigations and appraisals. Currently, this new type of tiger stove is being promoted throughout the province. Kunming City has established a command headquarters specifically for promoting the new type of tiger stove. Provincial-level agencies and schools, the Kunming garrison, Kunming municipal-level agencies, schools, factories, and Wuhua and Panlong districts have established command sub-headquarters for promoting the tiger stove. Each command sub-headquarters has organized the administrative staff and kitchen staff of its affiliated units to carry out technological innovation of the stove. Kunming City requires that all existing old stoves in the city be converted to tiger stoves in about 20 to 30 days, striving to reduce coal consumption to the lowest level from April onwards.

### 食堂炊具改革又一创造  云南推广新型“老虎灶”

    食堂炊具改革又一创造
    云南推广新型“老虎灶”
    “老虎灶”的好处是：节约燃料60％以上；火力旺，火眼多，煮饭做菜同时进行，节省做饭时间，节约炊事人员23％；什么燃料都能烧，可在城市、农村普遍推广。
    本报昆明19日电　云南省正在大力推广一种能够节约大量燃料、提高炊事劳动效率的新型老虎灶。据调查，采用这种新型老虎灶以后，用煤可较旧灶节省60％到80％，炊事人员可减少23％左右。有关领导部门认为，新型老虎灶的创造和推广，是当前食堂炊事工具改革中的重要一宝。
    这种新型老虎灶，是红河哈尼族彝族自治州开远县城关区食堂炊事人员创造的。他们根据原有的一条龙灶、蔗渣灶、粗糠灶等几种不同类型的炉灶，经过集体研究，综合了各种灶型的优点而改进成功。新型老虎灶的特点是：一个火门三口锅，灰槽大而深（长一米四五、宽六厘米、深一米七），炉条长而宽（长一米二、宽二厘米成斜坡形），烟囱高大（七至九米左右）。建一个新型的老虎灶，需要砖二千三百块（也可以用土坯代替），河沙两方，石灰一千公斤，长的土炉条二十根、短的六根，以及蒸气甑和过气管等材料，全部成本（包括材料、人工在内）共二百多元。
    这种新型老虎灶在红河哈尼族彝族自治州各地推广的结果证明，它有如下几大好处：第一，燃料用的少，但火力很旺。譬如开远县城关区九个公共食堂，每个食堂一般都有四百至七百人吃饭，这九个食堂在未使用老虎灶以前，每月要烧煤一百二十五吨，合每人每月用煤二十八公斤，改用老虎灶以后，每月只烧二十一吨半，每人每月合煤四公斤八两。使用前后比较，老虎灶比旧灶节约煤82．8％。由于节约了燃料，相应地也节约了运输燃料的大量运输力和劳动力。第二，因为火力很旺，一个灶上几个火眼，装三口锅，煮饭、烧水、炒菜同时进行，节省做饭时间。开远县城关区九个公共食堂，过去煮一顿饭一般需要四至五个小时，炊事人员每天早上三、四点钟就要起床，一天忙到晚；有时因为计划不周，还不能保证按时吃饭，影响社员出工。改用老虎灶以后，每顿饭只用两个半小时就做好了。社员反映，以前是人等饭，现在是饭等人。炊事人员每天也可以抽出四至五个小时学习文化和政治，休息时间也有了保证。第三，因为蒸饭、炒菜、烧水等能够同时进行，煮饭的炊事员可以利用蒸饭时间炒菜、烧水，这就比旧灶省人力。开远县城关区九个食堂在改用老虎灶以前，有炊事员六十七人，一个炊事员平均做六十八个人的饭。改用老虎灶以后，炊事员减为五十一人，平均一个炊事员能做八十七人的饭。九个食堂共省出了劳动力十六个，参加了其他生产。第四，这种灶烧什么燃料都行，无论城市、农村、机关、学校或部队都可以推广。锯末、野草、枯枝、落叶、碎煤、大煤等，凡是能燃火的东西都可以烧。群众称赞它说：“老虎灶不拣嘴，什么都能吃！”
    炊事用具的这一重大改革出现之后，云南省有关领导部门立即派出工作组进行了调查和鉴定。目前这种新型老虎灶正在全省推广。昆明市已专门建立了推广新型老虎灶指挥部。省级机关和学校、昆明驻军、昆明市级机关、学校、工厂以及五华、盘龙区等已经成立了推广老虎灶指挥分部。各指挥分部已分别组织所属单位的事务人员、炊事人员进行炉灶的技术革新。昆明市要求在二十天至一个月左右的时间，把全市现有的旧灶全部改成老虎灶，力争从4月起把煤耗降低到最低的水平。
