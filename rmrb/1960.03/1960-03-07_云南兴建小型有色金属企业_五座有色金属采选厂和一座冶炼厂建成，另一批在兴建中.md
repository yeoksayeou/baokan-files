Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 4th. Small-scale non-ferrous metal enterprises using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods are blossoming everywhere in Yunnan. The province has already completed five small-scale non-ferrous metal mining and processing plants and one smelting plant; and some small-scale plants are under construction. With the exception of Kunming City, each special district or autonomous prefecture in the province is building or already has its own small-scale non-ferrous metal industry.

These small-scale enterprises have many advantages, such as low investment, easy access to equipment, rapid construction, ease of operation, and full utilization of dispersed resources. In particular, they can quickly produce non-ferrous metals to meet the current needs of construction. The equipment for building small-scale mining and processing plants and smelting plants can mostly be manufactured by factories within the province, and the basic construction projects are almost entirely undertaken by the localities themselves. The enterprises that have been put into production are also operating normally. Various technical and economic indicators are steadily rising, and some indicators are comparable to those of large-scale foreign enterprises. Yunnan Province has many varieties of non-ferrous metal ores, widely distributed, and abundant reserves. During the mass movement to vigorously develop industry in 1958, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the "walking on two legs" policy of combining large, medium, and small scales and combining indigenous and foreign methods, launched a mass movement of indigenous copper smelting throughout the province while accelerating the construction of modern large-scale enterprises. In that year, the province's production of crude copper increased more than twenty-three times compared to 1957, and the production of other non-ferrous metals also developed simultaneously. Last year, on the basis of indigenous copper smelting, the province carried out geological exploration and site selection for non-ferrous metals, and began to transition to "small-scale foreign groups." The Provincial Department of Metallurgy and other departments first concentrated their efforts on building the province's first small-scale mining, processing, and smelting enterprise using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods in Machangqing, Dali City, and used this plant as a training class to train hundreds of technical personnel for the autonomous prefectures and special districts who could master the construction and production of "small-scale foreign group" enterprises. At the beginning of this year, the Provincial Party Committee determined the construction policy for small-scale non-ferrous metal enterprises. The relevant industrial departments in the province vigorously assisted in solving the problems of equipment, materials, and other issues needed in construction, and the Department of Metallurgy also established a special office to lead this work, so that the flowers of small-scale non-ferrous metal "foreign groups" quickly blossomed throughout the province.

    云南兴建小型有色金属企业
    五座有色金属采选厂和一座冶炼厂建成，另一批在兴建中
    新华社昆明4日电　用土洋结合的方法生产的小型有色金属企业在云南遍地开花。全省已经建成五座小型有色金属采选厂和一座冶炼厂；还有一些小型厂正在建设。除昆明市以外，全省各专区或自治州都正在建设或已经有了自己的小型有色金属工业。
    这种小型企业具有投资少、设备容易解决、建设快、容易操作和可以充分利用分散资源等的许多优点。特别是能够很快生产出有色金属，满足当前建设的需要。建设小型采选厂和冶炼厂的设备，大部分都可以由省内工厂制造，基本建设工程几乎完全由各地自己担负。已投入生产的企业，生产也很正常。各项技术经济指标稳步上升，有的指标还可与大洋企业媲美。云南省的有色金属矿品种多，分布广，藏量也很丰富。在1958年大办工业的群众运动中，中共云南省委根据大中小结合和土洋结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，在加速建设现代化大型企业的同时，在全省开展了一个群众性的土法炼铜运动。这一年，全省生产的粗铜比1957年增加二十三倍多，其它有色金属的生产也同时有了发展。去年，全省在土法炼铜的基础上，对有色金属进行了地质勘探和选点工作，开始向“小洋群”过渡。省冶金厅等部门首先集中力量在大理市马厂箐建成了全省第一座用土洋结合的方法生产的小型采选冶炼企业，用这个厂作训练班，为各自治州和专区培养出了几百个能掌握“小洋群”企业建设和生产的技术人材。今年初，省委确定了小型有色金属企业的建设方针。省里有关工业部门大力协助解决建设中需要的设备、材料等问题，冶金厅也专门成立办公室领导这一工作，使有色金属小洋群的花朵很快开遍全省。
