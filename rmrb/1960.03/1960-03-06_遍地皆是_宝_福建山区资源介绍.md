Everywhere is a “Treasure”
——An Introduction to Resources in the Mountainous Areas of Fujian

"Green Vault" - Sea of Trees
    Taking the train on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, after passing through the Tieniu Pass at the foot of Wuyi Mountain, you enter the mountainous area of Fujian, where mountains are connected and lush forests and bamboos are everywhere. Fujian is located in the subtropical and temperate zones, with a mild climate, abundant rainfall, and rich products, producing timber, Mao bamboo, tea, rice, medicinal materials, animal skins, and various wild plants.

    Fujian is one of China's main forest areas. The mountainous forest area reaches more than 38 million mu, and the timber reserves reach more than 230 million cubic meters. Since liberation, timber production has increased rapidly. In 1959, the province produced 3.5 million cubic meters of timber, an increase of 13 times compared with 250,000 cubic meters in 1950.

    Fujian not only has inexhaustible forests, but also has a wide variety of trees. Among them, camphor trees, sassafras trees, and eucommia ulmoides are all valuable and rare tree species.

    The camphor tree is one of the special tree species in southern China. Fujian ranks first in the country in camphor trees, the largest being up to 14 zhang high with a trunk circumference of four or five zhang. Its wood is solid, with beautiful texture, fragrant, resistant to insects, and resistant to water and moisture. It is a good material for manufacturing ships, boxes, cabinets, wardrobes, and art crafts. Because its branches, trunks, roots and leaves all contain volatile oil, it can be used to make camphor and camphor oil, which are important raw materials for medicine and industry.

    Sassafras is one of the rare tree species in the world. Sassafras has a fine and straight texture, is fragrant, resistant to borers, and not easy to catch fire. It is also elastic and contractible. Iron nails are driven in, and the cracks close automatically. It is an ideal material for shipbuilding industry. Sassafras fruit can also be used to squeeze oil for lighting lamps.

    Deciduous trees with high economic value - Eucommia ulmoides also grow here. Its bark and leaves contain silvery-white elastic filaments, which can be used to extract rubber. The bark is also a good medicine for treating high blood pressure.

Natural Steel - Bamboo Forest
    Fujian is one of the regions with the most bamboo production in China. The bamboo forest area is 4.7 million mu, and there are more than 560 million bamboo materials of various types. There are many types of bamboo and a wide range of uses. In addition to the common Mao bamboo, Ma bamboo, green bamboo, Lou bamboo, Gang bamboo, bitter bamboo, yellow bamboo, etc., there are also dozens of types such as cotton bamboo, stone bamboo, water bamboo, flower bamboo, purple bamboo, red bamboo, and square bamboo. Bamboo can be used by people at any time from shoots to mature wood. Bamboo shoots are a delicious food and can also be made into dried bamboo shoots for long-distance sales and long-term storage. Young bamboo can be used to make paper, and various bamboos can also be used to make furniture, agricultural tools, fishing gear and other tools and daily necessities. Bamboo has strong tensile strength, compressive strength, and bending resistance. Some people call it "natural steel", which can be used to replace steel bars in general reinforced concrete buildings. In addition, bamboo can also be used to manufacture rayon, fiberboard, and plastics. Now, Fujian's annual bamboo production has increased from more than 7 million in 1950 to more than 25.8 million last year.

Fragrance in the Valley - Min Tea
    Take a bus north from Shaowu Station on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, and you will soon enter the Wuyi Mountain tea area. There is a burst of tea fragrance between the winding streams and the overlapping peaks. Now the spring tea has begun to show its buds, and it will soon be picked in large quantities.

    The main tea producing areas in Fujian are spread over more than 30 counties including Fu'an, Zhenghe, Chong'an, and Anxi, and it is one of the six major tea areas in China. In 1959, tea production reached more than 200,000 dan, an increase of nearly two times compared with the early days of liberation. The tea produced includes black tea and green tea made by fermentation and non-fermentation, oolong tea (also known as green tea) made by semi-fermentation, and white tea made by exposing the buds and leaves of tea trees to the scorching sun without kneading, fermentation, and baking, as well as scented tea made from green tea and scented with fragrant flowers produced in Fujian. This is the tea area with the most varieties of tea in the country. Among them, Wuyi Zhengyan Narcissus, Wuyi Zhengyan Qizhong, Anxi Tieguanyin, Bailin Gongfu, Zhenghe Gongfu and Shiting Green, Bai Mudan and other world-renowned top-quality teas. Wuyi Zhengyan Narcissus and Zhengyan Qizhong, because the tree species grow on the cliffs of the Wuyi Mountain scenic area and are nourished by mist and dew all year round, the color is verdant and the fragrance is pleasant after skillful processing. It was praised as "Qi Ming" in tea more than a thousand years ago.

A Wide Variety of Wild Plants
    In the deep mountains and dense forests of Fujian Province, there are various wild plants with high economic value. According to preliminary surveys, more than 1,500 kinds of wild plants have been discovered and utilized in the province, and there are nearly 1,000 kinds of wild medicinal materials. Last year, the province purchased 1.35 million dan of wild plants (excluding medicinal materials), an increase of 1.35 times compared with 1958, which not only increased the income of communes and members by more than 27 million yuan, but also opened up a large number of raw material sources for light industry and the chemical industry.

    Among the large number of wild plants, acorns, which have been newly discovered and utilized in recent years, have now become important raw materials for food, light industry, and the chemical industry. Acorn kernels are rich in starch, sugar, protein, fat, etc., and can be used to replace grains and beans to make wine, noodles, cakes, tofu, etc. Acorn distiller's grains are also good feed. Acorn shells can be used to extract important raw materials for industry. The remaining residue can also be made into pulp to make high-grade paper. Therefore, it is called a wild plant that is "full of treasures".

    The broad masses of commune members sing in songs: "When the gate of the mountainous area is opened, treasures are revealed everywhere. There is tea, bamboo and timber, fruits and oil crops are planted all over the mountains; countless wild plants, coal, iron, copper and zinc are buried underground, water resources are everywhere, and factories and power stations are built; with the axe to open the mountains we will create a happy life."

    遍地皆是“宝”
    ——福建山区资源介绍
   “绿色金库”——树海
    乘坐鹰潭—厦门铁路的火车，穿过武夷山麓的铁牛关以后，就进入了山岭连亘、遍地茂林修竹的福建山区。福建地处亚热带和温带，气候温和，雨量充沛，物产富饶，盛产木材、毛竹、茶叶、稻谷、药材、兽皮和各种野生植物。
    福建是我国的主要林区之一。山区森林面积即达三千八百多万亩，木材蓄积量达二亿三千多万立方米。解放以来，木材产量迅速增加，1959年全省生产木材三百五十万立方米，比1950年的二十五万立方米增加了十三倍。
    福建不仅有采伐不尽的森林，而且树的种类繁多，其中樟树、檫树和杜仲等都是贵重和稀有树种。
    樟树是我国南部特产树种之一。福建的樟树占全国第一，最大的高达十四丈、干围达四、五丈。它的木质坚实，纹理美丽，有香气，能避免虫害又能耐水湿，是制造船只、箱柜、衣橱和美术工艺品的良好材料。由于它的枝干根叶都含有挥发性油，可以制樟脑和樟脑油，是医药和工业重要原料。
    檫树是世界上稀有树种之一。檫树纹理细密通直，有香气，能避蛀、又不易着火，并且富有弹性和紧缩性，铁钉钉入，裂缝即自动闭合，是造船工业上的理想用材。檫的果实，还可榨油点灯。
    这里还生长着经济价值很高的落叶乔木——杜仲。它的树皮和树叶都含有银白色的弹性细丝，可以提炼橡胶。树皮还是一种治高血压病的良药。
    天然钢材——竹林
    福建是我国产竹最多的地区之一。竹林面积有四百七十万亩，生长各种竹材五亿六千多万根。竹子的种类很多、用途很广，除了常见的毛竹、麻竹、绿竹、篓竹、刚竹、苦竹、黄竹等外，还有棉竹、石竹、水竹、花竹、紫竹、红竹、四方竹等几十种。竹子从笋到成材，随时都可供人们利用。竹笋是美味食品，又可制成笋干，便于远销和久藏。幼竹可以制纸，用各种竹子还可以制成家具、农具、渔具等工具和日用品。竹子的抗拉力、抗压力和耐弯曲力都很强，有人称它为“天然钢材”，可以代替钢筋建筑一般混凝土钢筋建筑物。此外，竹子还可用来制造人造丝、纤维板和塑料。现在福建竹子年产量已由1950年的七百多万根，增加到去年的二千五百八十多万根。
    幽谷生香——闽茶
    从鹰潭—厦门铁路邵武车站改乘汽车北行，不久即进入了武夷山茶区。在溪涧盘旋、层峦叠翠之间。传来阵阵茶香。现在春茗已开始露芽，不久就可大量采摘了。
    福建茶叶主要产地，遍布在福安、政和、崇安、安溪等三十多个县份，是我国六大茶区之一。1959年茶叶产量达二十多万担，比解放初期增加近两倍。所产茶叶中有经过发酵和不发酵制成的红茶和绿茶，有经过半发酵制成的乌龙茶（又称青茶），还有不经过揉捻、发酵和烘焙而将茶树的芽、叶，在烈日下曝晒而成的白茶，还有用绿茶为原料，用福建盛产的香花窨制而成的花茶。这里是全国茶叶品种最多的茶区，其中武夷正岩水仙、武夷正岩奇种、安溪铁观音、白琳工夫、政和工夫和石亭绿、白牡丹等都是世界闻名的极品名茶。武夷正岩水仙、正岩奇种，由于树种生长在武夷山风景区的悬崖绝壁之间，长年饱受雾露润养，经过加工巧制后，颜色青翠、幽香扑鼻，早在一千多年前就被誉为茶中“奇茗”。
    种类繁多的野生植物
    在福建省深山密林里，生长着各种各样的经济价值很高的野生植物。据初步调查，全省已经发现和利用的野生植物有一千五百多种，有野生药材近千种。去年全省收购的野生植物（不包括药材）即达一百三十五万担，比1958年增加一点三五倍，既增加了公社和社员二千七百多万元的收入，又为轻工业、化学工业增辟了大量原料来源。
    在大量的野生植物中，而近年新发现和利用的橡子，现在也已经成为食品、轻工业和化学工业的重要原料。橡子仁含有丰富的淀粉、糖分、蛋白质、脂肪等，可以代替粮食和豆类用来酿酒和作粉条、糕点、豆腐等。橡子酒糟又是良好的饲料。橡子壳可以提炼工业的重要原料。最后剩下的渣滓还可制成纸浆，制造高级纸。因此被称为是“混身是宝”的野生植物。
    广大社员都编歌唱道：“山区大门一打开，遍地财宝显出来。有茶有竹有木材，水果油料满山栽；野生植物无其数，煤铁铜锌地下埋，水力资源遍地有，工厂电站办起来；有了公社开山斧，幸福花儿满山开。”（蔡清河、陈启桐）
