　　This Move Should Be Timely

　　After the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is fully launched, enterprise leaders have many things to grasp, and rectifying labor organization and improving production management are the most urgent.

　　Technical revolution is a revolution of developing productive forces. At present, due to the realization and promotion of a large number of innovation proposals, a new situation has emerged in enterprises, characterized by: the degree of semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation is rapidly increasing. Manual operation has decreased, equipment efficiency has improved, production processes have been shortened, process regulations have become more reasonable... and so on. In a word, productive forces are developing greatly.

　　In socialist society, the relationship between productive forces and production relations, superstructure and base is both adapted and contradictory. At present, in industrial and mining enterprises, this contradiction is manifested in the fact that enterprise management lags behind the development of productive forces. Currently, the mass movement of technical innovation is vigorously developing, and the liberation of productive forces has entered a new stage. Therefore, the trend of requiring the improvement of enterprise management is becoming stronger and stronger.

　　Under the socialist system, from the fundamental nature of social production relations, it is adapted to the development of productive forces, and it opens up broad avenues for the development of productive forces. However, if our work is not done in a timely manner, that is to say, when productive forces have greatly developed, if the production relations and the superstructure are not adjusted appropriately in time, it will hinder the further development of productive forces. The purpose of our large-scale technical innovation is to greatly improve labor productivity. When the further development of productive forces is restricted, how can every enterprise leader not be anxious?

　　Of course, just being anxious is of no use. The only way is to promptly grasp the improvement of enterprise management and promptly grasp the adjustment of labor organization. Like the factories in Hefei and the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, timely adjustment of labor organization in the technical innovation movement can promptly push the technical innovation movement further.

    此举要及时
    技术革新和技术革命的群众运动全面铺开以后，企业领导方面要抓的事情很多，而整顿劳动组织，改进生产管理却是急中之急。
    技术革命就是发展生产力的革命。目前，由于大量革新建议的实现和推广，企业里出现了一种崭新的局面，其特点是：半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化的程度在迅速提高。手工操作减少了，设备效率提高了，生产流程缩短了，工艺规程更加合理了……如是等等，一句话，生产力正在大发展。
    在社会主义社会中，生产力和生产关系、上层和基础是又相适应又相矛盾。目前在工矿企业中，这一矛盾就表现在企业管理落后于生产力的发展方面。当前，技术革新的群众运动正在蓬勃开展，生产力的解放，已经跨进了一个新的阶段。因此，要求改进企业管理的趋势，就越来越强烈了。
    在社会主义制度下，从社会生产关系的根本性质来说，它是适应于生产力发展的，它为生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路。但是，如果我们的工作做得不及时，也就是说，当生产力大大发展以后，生产关系和上层建筑如果不及时地加以适当的调整，就会妨碍生产力进一步的发展。我们大搞技术革新的目的，就是要大大提高劳动生产率，当生产力的进一步发展受到束缚的时候，每个企业领导人怎么能不着急呢？
    当然，光着急是无济于事的，唯一的办法就是要及时抓改进企业管理，及时抓调整劳动组织。像合肥市各工厂和贵阳矿山机器厂那样，在技术革新运动中及时调整劳动组织，就能把技术革新运动及时推进一步。
