Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala:

Your Excellency Prime Minister Koirala and Madam, Distinguished guests from Nepal, Friends, Comrades:

Today, we have the opportunity to gather with His Excellency Prime Minister Koirala and Madam, and the distinguished guests from Nepal, and we feel very honored. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to our distinguished guests.

China and Nepal are friendly neighbors. Our two peoples began friendly exchanges more than a thousand years ago and formed a close friendship. Although our friendly relations were once interrupted in modern times due to colonialist aggression, we are pleased that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries and the determination to use the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles guiding relations between the two countries, we have not only resumed contact, but also continuously developed our friendship on a new foundation. In early 1957, I visited your beautiful country at the invitation of the Nepalese government. During that visit, I was honored to receive the warm hospitality of His Majesty King Mahendra, the Nepalese government, and the people, and deeply felt the sincere friendship of the Nepalese people towards the Chinese people. All of this left me with precious and unforgettable impressions. Prime Minister, during your visit to our country this time, I believe you will also feel the same sincere friendship that our people hold for the Nepalese people. The development of Sino-Nepalese friendly relations is by no means accidental; it is the common aspiration of the two peoples and the interest of both countries.

China and Nepal are both ancient countries and very young countries. Our two peoples have inherited the tradition of mutual sympathy and support in the past struggle for national independence and against colonialism, and today are engaged in increasingly broad cooperation in the cause of national construction and the maintenance of world peace. The Chinese people are eager to get rid of the long-term economic and cultural backwardness and build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible. We have already achieved some success, but our task is arduous, and we still need to make long-term and greater efforts. We also warmly hope that Nepal and other Asian and African countries will be able to quickly get rid of the backwardness caused by colonial rule and become prosperous and strong countries with developed industry and agriculture. We have always expressed concern and admiration for the Nepalese government and people's urgent desire to build the country and develop the ecomony. We sincerely wish them success.

The Nepalese government has consistently pursued the policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs. Prime Minister, you have pointed out many times that the Nepalese government has decided to adopt an independent neutral policy, will not participate in any military bloc under any circumstances, and will resolutely implement the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government and people welcome and completely support this wise policy of the Nepalese government, because this policy not only conforms to the interests of the Nepalese people, but also helps promote Asian-African unity and world peace. The Chinese government has always unremittingly adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and has always advocated resolving all outstanding issues with other countries, especially with neighboring countries, through friendly consultations. Time and history have proven, and will continue to prove, that this policy of the Chinese government is firm and unwavering. We are pleased to see that this policy of the Chinese government has been trusted and understood by the Nepalese government and people. The Chinese government is willing to further strengthen cooperation with the Nepalese government to jointly make more contributions to upholding the Five Principles and world peace.

Prime Minister, your visit gives us the opportunity to frankly exchange views on strengthening friendly cooperative relations between China and Nepal and other issues of common concern to the two countries. I believe that your friendly visit will definitely help further consolidate and develop the friendship between our two countries, and will also help promote the unity of Asian and African countries and world peace. We also sincerely hope that during your visit in Beijing and other parts of our country, you will be able to offer valuable opinions on our construction work.

I propose:

For the friendship between China and Nepal,
For the unity of Asian and African countries,
For the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,
For world peace,
For the prosperity of the Kingdom of Nepal and the happiness of the people,
For the health of His Excellency Prime Minister Koirala and Madam, and all the distinguished guests,
For the health of His Majesty King Mahendra of Nepal,
Cheers!

    在欢迎柯伊拉腊首相宴会上的讲话
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社12日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊宴会上的讲话尊敬的柯伊拉腊首相阁下和夫人尼泊尔的贵宾们朋友们，同志们：
    今天，我们有机会同柯伊拉腊首相阁下和夫人以及尼泊尔的贵宾们欢聚一堂，感到十分荣幸。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，向我们的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    中国和尼泊尔是友好的邻居。我们两国人民早在一千多年以前就开始了友好往来并且结成了亲密的友谊。尽管我们的友好关系在近代曾经由于殖民主义的侵略而一度中断，但是，我们感到高兴的是，自从我们两国建立外交关系并且确定以和平共处五项原则作为指导两国关系的基本原则以来，我们不仅恢复了联系，而且在新的基础上不断地发展我们之间的友谊。1957年初，我应尼泊尔政府的邀请访问了你们美丽的国家。在那次访问中，我荣幸地得到马亨德拉国王陛下、尼泊尔政府和人民对我们的热情款待，深深体会到尼泊尔人民对中国人民的真挚友情。这一切都给我留下了珍贵而难忘的印象。首相阁下，在你这次来我国访问中，我相信你也会感到我国人民对尼泊尔人民所抱有的同样真挚的友情。中尼友好关系的发展决不是偶然的，它是两国人民的共同愿望，也是两国人民的利益所在。
    中尼两国都是古老的国家，又是十分年轻的国家。我们两国人民继承了过去在争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争中相互同情、相互支持的传统，今天又在国家建设和维护世界和平的事业中进行着日益广泛的合作。中国人民热望摆脱长期以来经济、文化上的落后状态，把我国尽快地建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。我们已经取得了一些成就，但是，我们的任务是艰巨的，我们还需要做出长期的、更大的努力。我们同样热情地希望尼泊尔和其他亚非国家也都能够迅速地摆脱殖民统治所造成的落后，成为工农业发达的繁荣富强的国家。我们对于尼泊尔政府和人民迫切要求建设国家和发展经济的愿望和努力，一向表示关切和钦佩。我们衷心地祝愿他们获得成功。
    尼泊尔政府在国际事务中一贯奉行和平中立政策。首相阁下曾经多次指出，尼泊尔政府决定采取独立的中立政策，在任何情况下都不会参加任何军事集团，并且将坚决执行著名的和平共处五项原则。中国政府和人民欢迎并且完全支持尼泊尔政府这一明智的政策，因为这一政策不仅符合尼泊尔人民的利益，而且有利于促进亚非团结和世界和平。中国政府始终不懈地坚持和平共处五项原则，并且一贯主张通过友好协商的办法解决同别国特别是同邻国之间的一切悬而未决的问题。时间和历史已经证明，并且将继续证明，中国政府的这一政策是坚定不移的。我们高兴地看到，中国政府的这一政策得到了尼泊尔政府和人民的信任和理解。中国政府愿意同尼泊尔政府进一步加强合作，共同为维护五项原则和世界和平作出更多的贡献。
    首相阁下，你的来访使我们有机会就加强中尼之间的友好合作关系和两国共同关心的其他问题坦率地交换意见。我相信，你的友好访问必将有助于进一步巩固和发展我们两国间的友谊，并且将有助于促进亚非国家的团结和世界和平。我们还衷心地希望阁下在北京和我国其他地方的参观中，能够对我们的建设工作提出宝贵的意见。
    我提议：
    为中尼两国的友谊，
    为亚非各国的团结，
    为和平共处五项原则的胜利，
    为世界和平，
    为尼泊尔王国的繁荣和人民的幸福，
    为柯伊拉腊首相阁下和夫人，以及全体贵宾们的健康，
    为尼泊尔国王马亨德拉陛下的健康，
    干杯。
