Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 2nd: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today condemning the imperialist nuclear arms race and calling for complete and thorough disarmament, as well as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East.

	The Secretariat's statement was issued to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the "Bikini Island Incident." Six years ago, on March 1st, the United States tested a hydrogen bomb on Bikini Island, causing casualties to Japanese fishermen.

	The statement said that the imperialists have consistently used their nuclear weapons to intimidate the people of all countries in their struggle for independence and peace, and to aggravate world tensions.

	The statement condemned France's despicable crime of conducting atomic tests in the Sahara and its attempt to take this criminal action again.

	The statement also said, "At the same time, we cannot ignore the new 'Security Treaty' signed between the United States and Japan, because this treaty attempts to divide Afro-Asian solidarity, perpetuate the current abnormal and dangerous situation in the Far East, and, just like helping West Germany, revive Japan as an imperialist power possessing nuclear weapons."

	The statement said that the more the imperialists try to intimidate the people's struggles and divide their unity, the firmer the people's position becomes, and the more consolidated Afro-Asian solidarity becomes.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: TASS, Geneva: World public opinion has been watching the progress of the three-nation conference on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, which has lasted for more than a year and a half, with extreme unease. Tsarapkin, the Soviet representative attending the meeting, received a delegation from the World Peace Council on February 29, composed of Wen Youzhang, a member of the Presidium of the World Peace Council, Fernand Vigne, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, and Artur Maniev, a member of the World Peace Council.

	The World Peace Council delegation expressed concern about the protracted nature of the negotiations to ban nuclear weapon tests and were very concerned about the reasons for this unsatisfactory situation.

	In response, Tsarapkin pointed out that the conference had indeed been at a standstill for nearly nine months. The real reason for this situation is that certain influential groups in the United States, particularly the Pentagon and the Atomic Energy Commission, are attempting to obstruct the conclusion of an agreement completely banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons by using the pretext of technical difficulties in supervision. Recently, the US delegation at the Geneva conference proposed limiting the scope of the treaty banning nuclear tests.

	The purpose of this US proposal is to exempt underground nuclear explosions of a certain magnitude from the treaty. Undoubtedly, this proposal would lead to the resumption of nuclear weapon tests and would intensify the nuclear arms race.

	Tsarapkin told the World Peace Council delegation that he fully sympathized with the concerns of world public opinion about the abnormal and prolonged stagnation of the Geneva negotiations. He also pointed out that if the negotiations failed to achieve the prompt conclusion of a treaty halting all kinds of nuclear weapon tests, it would be a threat to the cause of peace.

    亚非人民团结理事会发表声明
    谴责帝国主义进行核军备竞赛
    查拉普金揭露美国力图阻挠禁止核试验谈判
    新华社开罗2日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，谴责帝国主义的核军备竞赛，并且号召全面彻底裁军以及在中欧、远东和中东建立无核武器区。
    书记处的这项声明是为了纪念“比基尼岛事件”六周年。六年前的3月1日，美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹，使日本渔民受到伤亡。
    声明说，帝国主义者一贯利用他们的核武器来恐吓各国人民争取独立和和平的斗争以及加剧世界紧张局势。
    声明谴责法国在撒哈拉进行原子试验的卑鄙罪行以及它打算再次采取这一罪恶行动的企图。
    声明还说，“与此同时，我们不能忽视美国同日本所签订的新‘安全条约’，因为这一条约企图分裂亚非团结、长期保存远东目前不正常的和危险的形势，并且正像帮助西德那样，来使日本作为拥有核武器的帝国主义力量而复活。”
    声明说，可是，帝国主义者愈是要恐吓人民的斗争，分裂他们的团结，人民的立场就愈加坚定，亚非团结就愈加巩固。
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：世界公众一直极其不安地注视着已经持续一年半以上的三国不继续试验核武器会议的进程。出席会议的苏联代表查拉普金2月29日接见了由世界和平理事会主席团委员文幼章、世界和平理事会书记处书记费南·维涅和世界和平理事会委员阿图尔·马涅夫组成的世界和平理事会代表团。
    世界和平理事会代表团对禁止试验核武器谈判的旷日持久表示忧虑，并且很关心这种不能令人满意的情况的原因究竟何在。
    查拉普金在回答时指出，近九个月来，会议的确处于停滞状态。这种情况的实际原因是：美国的某些有影响的集团、特别是五角大楼和原子能委员会企图以监督的技术困难作借口阻碍签订完全禁止试验原子武器和氢武器的协议。不久前，美国代表团在日内瓦会议上建议限制禁止核试验条约的有效范围。
    美国的这个建议的目的在于使具有一定威力的地下核爆炸不受条约的约束，无疑，这个建议会导致核武器试验的恢复，会使核军备竞赛加剧。
    查拉普金对世界和平理事会代表团说，他完全同情世界公众由于日内瓦谈判不正常的长期停滞而产生的忧虑。他并且指出，如果谈判不能使停止核武器的各种试验的条约迅速签订，将会是对和平事业的威胁。
