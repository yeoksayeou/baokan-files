Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 29th. After three days of enthusiastic discussion, Anshan Iron and Steel workers have formulated specific measures, determined to respond to the initiative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company workers with practical actions to complete the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule. Their goal is: to go all out, fight hard in March, ensure March exceeds February, and compared to February, guarantee steel exceeds by 14.4%, pig iron exceeds by 8.5%, and steel materials exceed by 7.3%, to ensure the first quarter plan is completed ahead of schedule and in an all-round manner, and to make full preparations for the continued leap forward in the second quarter.

Since entering the 1960s, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines have further launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement. From the beginning of the year to February 26th, the company's workers have proposed more than 410,000 technical innovation proposals, breaking through many key production bottlenecks, and pushing the production level of steel, iron, and steel materials to a new peak. The initiative put forward by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company workers has further stimulated the soaring enthusiasm of Anshan Iron and Steel workers. They are determined to work hard in March and be vanguards in the high tide of steel production.

The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant unanimously guaranteed to complete the first quarter steel production plan one day ahead of schedule, achieving a monthly red banner in the first quarter. Their measures are: to vigorously increase the charge volume of open-hearth furnaces, greatly shorten steelmaking time, resolutely maintain the open-hearth furnace body, and increase the furnace bottom utilization coefficient in March from 10.34 in the first 28 days of February to 11.2, creating the highest level of monthly furnace bottom utilization coefficient since the start of operation.

The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant signed a friendly competition contract with the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant on February 15th, and the initiative of Shijingshan workers has further stimulated their enthusiasm and determination. With the support of the raw material system workers, all workers in the plant guaranteed to learn from Shijingshan, surpass Shijingshan, and fully realize the competition conditions. The workers of the national red banner blast furnace—Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 Blast Furnace—decided to increase the blast furnace utilization coefficient from 2.351 in January to 2.5 in March, overfulfilling the first quarter plan and winning the national large blast furnace championship. Since the No. 9 Blast Furnace underwent a medium repair according to plan in early February, the utilization coefficient has steadily increased to above 2.4.

The ambition of the rolling steel system workers is even greater, and their enthusiasm is even higher. The workers of the No. 1 Blooming Mill firmly guaranteed to complete the first quarter billet production plan four days ahead of schedule, creating good conditions for brother rolling mills to complete the plan ahead of schedule. The workers of the No. 1 Medium Plate Mill planned to transform the existing old equipment and realize mechanization and semi-automation of the entire process from steel heating and rolling to final shearing.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st. The workers of Shanghai's steel industry enthusiastically responded to the initiative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, determined to work hard in March, and on the basis of completing the first quarter production plan, strive to increase steel production by 10% and steel materials production by 20%, and make full preparations for the second quarter production.

After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's initiative was put forward, the Shanghai Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau and various steel plants held meetings of cadres and workers to study how to push steel production to a new peak of high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, and comprehensive leap forward in conservation at the fastest speed. The workers of Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant decided to strive to double the production level of converters within one year starting from March, make the converter workshop an alloy steel workshop within three months, and realize full mechanization and semi-mechanization of steelmaking within half a year.

While focusing on current production, all factories have put forward a series of specific measures. In terms of cupola furnaces, various factories have decided to vigorously promote the three major measures of alkaline hot blast cupola furnaces that can immediately increase production and quality and save pig iron coke, "New Thai-style" cupola furnaces that use waste heat to increase temperature, and water-cooled tuyeres; in terms of converters, vigorously grasp effective innovation measures such as hot air blowing and adding coal powder to increase temperature; in terms of open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces, it was decided to focus on multi-charging, rapid refining, and mechanized charging; in terms of rolling steel, widely promote the advanced experience of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and Hua Feng Steel Plant's coal powder injection burners and new technologies such as rolling mill roller tables.

Due to the large-scale technical innovation in Shanghai's steel plants, the production level has been continuously rising. The output of steel in January increased by 137% compared with the same period last year; by February 25th, the average daily output increased by 5.3% compared with January.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. All the workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Company responded to the initiative of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and decided to continue to make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, to ensure the completion of the first quarter steel and steel materials production plan two to three days ahead of schedule, and to prepare for the second quarter of steel production. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the company's Party committee has made specific arrangements for raw materials, transportation, and spare parts. The company's leading cadres have also decided to take charge of specific areas and go deep into various factories and mines to assist in mobilizing the masses to launch a new production upsurge. The company's current main technical measures to improve blast furnaces are: vigorously increasing blower capacity, increasing wind temperature, improving the quality of artificial rich ore, and strengthening blast furnace maintenance, and strive to produce more high-quality pig iron. In terms of electric furnace steelmaking, measures such as raw material preheating and double-linked steelmaking of electric furnace converters will be adopted to shorten the smelting time and improve the quality of steel in every possible way.

The No. 1 Steel Plant of this company, which has maintained the national large and medium-sized blast furnace utilization coefficient championship for 23 consecutive months, completed the February pig iron production plan more than two days ahead of schedule, with an average blast furnace utilization coefficient of 2.401. The goal they put forward for a big effort in March is: to increase the average utilization coefficient of a medium-sized blast furnace to three, the quality of pig iron should all meet national standards, and strive to complete the first quarter pig iron production plan ten days ahead of schedule.
