    Me and the Passengers
    Fan Guoying, Ticket Seller on Beijing Bus Route 13

    One cold winter morning, the northwest wind was blowing hard. I was busy selling tickets on the bus. Because it was so cold, my hands were frozen and unresponsive, and it took a long time to tear a ticket. The bus was approaching Sanlihe Station when suddenly a pregnant woman stood up from her seat, took off her woolen gloves, and stuffed them into my hands, saying with a smile and a touch of affection, "Look how frozen you are! Why don't you wear gloves?" "No, it's not convenient to tear tickets with gloves on," I said anxiously, trying to put the gloves back into her hands, and added, "You must be cold too!" But she quickly stuffed the gloves into my pocket and said with a bit of annoyance, "You take such good care of the passengers every day. I'm not even very far along in my pregnancy, but you already noticed I needed a seat. If your hands get frostbite, how will you work?" With that, she got off the bus in a hurry. At that moment, I was so touched by the gloves that I didn't know what to do. Only when the bus started moving again did I remember that I hadn't chased after her to return them. Coincidentally, she rode my bus again the next day. After I explained repeatedly and showed her my own gloves, she finally took her gloves back.

    The passengers' concern and support for me made me deeply feel how warm and close the relationships between people are in our socialist country! It also shows that in our country there is no high or low status in work, only a difference in the division of labor. All work is respected and supported by the broad masses of the people, and they will praise you even if you only do a little bit of what you should do. I remember once, an old woman came to take the bus with a lot of things. I went up to help her carry her things onto the bus, found her a seat, and asked her where she was getting off. She said she was transferring to Route 31 at Pinganli, but she didn't know where Pinganli was. I promised to tell her when we arrived. But after a while, I worried that if I forgot to tell her, it would cause her a lot of trouble. Besides, it would be too tiring for her to walk to the Route 31 bus station with so many things. Therefore, I found another passenger who was going to Pinganli, asked him to tell the old woman when we arrived, and asked him to take her to the Route 31 bus station. The passenger happily agreed. When we arrived, he helped the old woman, holding her hand with one arm and carrying her things with the other, and got off the bus. At that time, several passengers praised me for my good service attitude and for taking such good care of the elderly. I was really a little embarrassed.

    Sometimes, because I was careless and negligent, I made mistakes in my work. The passengers not only didn't blame me, but also encouraged me. Once, two blind people took my bus. When they got on the bus, they repeatedly told me to tell them when we arrived at Di'anmen Station. But I forgot, and only remembered after we had passed three stops. I was so anxious that my face turned red. I quickly apologized to the blind people and helped them walk to the bus stop across the street, telling them to take the bus back three stops to get off. The blind people not only didn't get angry with me, but also said, "You're so kind, thank you."

    Whenever I encounter difficulties, passengers always volunteer to help me. For example, the last bus has to pull down the hook on the bus stop sign that says "Last Bus Has Passed," but because I'm short, I can't reach it. A passenger who takes the last bus every day takes the initiative to get off the bus to do this work for me. Sometimes when he's not there, other passengers go down to help pull the hook.

    When I first started working, my business skills were low, and I didn't have the idea of serving passengers wholeheartedly, so I sometimes had conflicts with passengers. I felt that this work was really difficult and I wasn't very enthusiastic about the passengers. Later, the Party organized us to carry out the study of "For whom do we labor, for whom do we serve," and invited veteran workers to tell us how ticket sellers were scolded and abused in the old society, and how ticket sellers' work is respected by the people now. They also introduced the advanced deeds of many excellent ticket sellers. These made me realize the significance of ticket selling work and examine my past wrong ideas. I worked hard to study my profession. Every day, when I had free time, I went to the bus to learn from the service attitude of excellent ticket sellers. At night, I practiced speaking in bed.

    After my service attitude improved, I felt that my work became easier.

    Over the past year or so, I have made friends with many passengers. Often, passengers whose names I don't know shake hands with me when they get off the bus and say they would like to be my friend. Some old women treat me like a mother. One old woman often takes my bus with her child. Every time, I help her carry the child and help her get on the bus, which moves her so much that she says, "I really wish I had a daughter like you." Once, she invited me to her house for dumplings on Tuesday, but unfortunately I had to work that day and couldn't go. A few days later, she saw me and said angrily, "Why didn't you come that day? I waited for you at the entrance of the alley for a long time." Some passengers, if they don't see me for a few days, ask other ticket sellers, "What happened to that little Fan? Is she all right?"

    我和乘客们
    北京十三路公共汽车售票员　范国英
    一个深冬的早晨，西北风刮得很紧，我在车上忙着售票，因为天太冷，两手冻得不听使唤，撕一张票要花很多时间。车子快到三里河站了，突然有一位孕妇从座位上站起来，脱下自己手上的毛手套，塞到我的手里，并微笑着而又带点疼爱的口气说：“看你冻的！干吗不戴上手套？”“不，戴手套撕票不方便。”我说着急忙把手套塞回她的手里，又说：“你自己也冷呀！”可是她很快地又把手套塞到我的衣袋里，还生气地说：“你每天那么热情地照顾乘客，我刚怀孕没多久，你就看出我需要座位，要是你的手冻坏了，怎么工作？”说完她就急匆匆地下车走了。当时我拿着这副手套感动得不知怎么好，等到车子开动，才想起没有追上去还给她。第二天凑巧她又坐了我的车，经我再三解释又拿出自己的手套给她看，她才把她的手套拿回去了。
    乘客对我的关怀、支持，使我深深感到：在我们社会主义国家里，人与人的关系是多么温暖、亲密！从这里也可以看出：在我们国家里工作没有高低之分，只有分工的不同；任何工作都受到广大人民的尊重和支持，而且你只做了一点点应做的工作，人家就表扬你。记得有一次，有一个老大妈来搭车，她拿了很多东西，我迎上去帮她把东西搬上车，找到座，又问她到哪里下车。她说到平安里换三十一路车，可是不知平安里在哪里？我答应到站一定叫她。但过了一会，我又担心万一我忘了叫，一定会给老太太增加很多麻烦，再说她拿那么多东西要走到三十一路车站也太费力，因此，我就找到了另一位到平安里的乘客，托他到站叫老大妈，并且请他送大妈到三十一路车站。这个乘客很高兴地答应了，到站后他一手扶着大妈，一手抱着东西下车走了。这时车里有好几位乘客都夸我服务态度好，对老人那么照顾，当时我真有点不好意思。
    有时候，我因为大意疏忽，工作上出了错，乘客不但不责备我，还鼓励我。有一次，两位盲人坐我的车，上车时他们一再跟我说到地安门站叫他们下车，可是我却忘记了，等到过了三站才想起来。当时急得我满面通红，忙向盲人道歉，并扶他们走到马路对面的车站，告诉他们往回坐三站就下车。盲人不但没向我生气，还说：“你真太好了，谢谢你。”
    在我遇到困难的时候，乘客总是自告奋勇地帮助我。比如末班车要把站牌上写着“末班车已过”的钩子拉下来，但是因为我个子矮，拉不来，有一个每天都坐末班车的乘客就主动下车帮我做这工作。有时他不在，别的乘客就下去帮助拉钩。
    我刚刚参加工作时，因为业务水平低，加上没有树立一心为乘客服务的思想，因此有时和乘客闹矛盾，心里觉得这工作真不好干，对乘客态度一点也不热情。后来党组织我们开展了“为谁劳动为谁服务”的学习，并请老工人给我们讲旧社会的售票员如何挨骂受气，现在的售票员工作又如何受到人民的尊重，还介绍了许多优秀售票员的先进事迹。这些使我认识了售票工作的意义，检查了过去的错误想法。我努力钻研业务，每天有空就到车上学习优秀售票员的服务态度，晚上在被窝里也练习讲话。
    服务态度改进以后，我觉得工作好做了。
    一年多来，我和许多乘客交了朋友。常常有不知道名字的乘客下车时和我握手，说愿意和我做朋友。有的老大妈更是像母亲一样对我。有一个老大妈常常抱着孩子坐我的车，每次我都帮她抱孩子，扶她上车，感动得她说：“我真想有你这么一个闺女。”有一次她约我星期二到她家吃饺子，可是不巧那天我有工作没有去，过了几天她看到我，生气地说：“那天你干吗不来？我在胡同口等了你半天。”有的乘客几天不见我，就向别的售票员打听：“那个小范怎么不见了，她身体好吧？”
