    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The American Black people's movement against racial discrimination has entered its sixth week and has swept across dozens of cities in eight states.

    On March 8, six hundred Black youths held a demonstration in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest the governor and education authorities' expulsion of nine students from Alabama State (Black) University for participating in "sit-in demonstrations" two weeks prior. The city authorities dispatched large numbers of military police who used tear gas and batons to attack the unarmed youths, and arrested thirty-seven people. Black youths were extremely indignant at the authorities' suppression measures and said that they would hold demonstrations in the future to protest.

    On the same day, seven hundred Black students at Tuskegee Institute, forty-three miles outside of Montgomery, went on strike in support of the nine expelled students.

    The struggle of Black people has achieved initial victories in some places. In North Carolina and Ohio, Black people have successfully sat down and eaten at the snack bars of several restaurants and stores.

    As the movement of Black people against racial discrimination rises, white racists have also stepped up their terrorist activities. They burned crosses in front of Black people's homes (a warning to kill Black people), threw bombs, and made threatening phone calls. In Texas, white racists even kidnapped a Black man named Turner on the night of the 7th, hung him upside down in a tree outside the city, and then used a knife to carve six K's (the symbol of the Ku Klux Klan) on his chest and abdomen.

    When condemning the above atrocities, Rouse, the secretary of the Southwestern Field Office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that Eisenhower is everywhere in South America touting "democracy" and "brotherhood," and now he should come to the American South to talk about "democracy" and "brotherhood."

    对于被压迫的屈辱地位忍无可忍
    美国黑人展开反种族歧视斗争
    据新华社讯　美国黑人反对种族歧视运动已经进入第六个星期，并且席卷了八个州数十个城市。
    六百名黑人青年8日在亚拉巴马州蒙哥马利市举行示威游行，抗议州长和教育当局开除因为在两星期前参加“静坐示威”的亚拉巴马州立（黑人）大学的九名学生。市当局出动了大批军警用催泪瓦斯和警棍冲击徒手的青年，还逮捕了三十七人。黑人青年对当局的镇压措施十分愤慨，他们表示以后还要举行示威抗议。
    在蒙哥马利市外四十三英里的杜斯克基学院的七百名黑人学生在同一天举行罢课，声援被开除的九名学生。
    黑人的斗争在一些地方已经取得了初步胜利。在北卡罗来纳州和俄亥俄州，黑人在几家饭店和商店的小吃部顺利地坐下来吃东西。
    随着黑人反对种族歧视运动的高涨，白色种族主义分子也加紧了恐怖行动。他们在黑人住所前燃烧十字架（要杀害黑人的警告），扔炸弹和打电话进行恫吓。在德克萨斯州，白色种族主义分子还在7日晚把一个名叫特纳的黑人劫持到郊外，把他倒吊在树上，然后用刀子在他的胸部和腹部刻上六个K字（三K党的标志）。
    美国全国有色人种协进会西南菲尔德的书记劳斯在谴责上述暴行时说，艾森豪威尔在南美到处宣传“民主”和“兄弟关系”，现在他应该到美国南部来谈谈“民主”和“兄弟关系”了。
