Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: The Jiaozuo Coal Mine completed its February raw coal production plan two days and eight hours ahead of schedule. The average daily output increased by 3.55% compared to January. The consumption of pit props per thousand tons of coal decreased to 15.05 cubic meters, a reduction of 14% compared to the previous month.

In order to ensure the continuous leap forward in coal production, the mine's workers launched a thorough technical innovation and technical revolution campaign in February. The Party organizations of each mine led the workers and masses, using the "three-way combination" method of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, to vigorously carry out technical performance competitions, production sports meets, and pace-setter selection competitions, thereby greatly promoting production by integrating relatively sporadic and dispersed advanced technologies and advanced experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th: The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau and the Lu'an Mining Bureau have completed their February raw coal production plans three days ahead of schedule with overfulfilled quotas.

Since the beginning of February, the Xishan Mining Bureau has comprehensively carried out technical performance competitions centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, which has continuously improved production efficiency. The workers of the Lu'an Mining Bureau also launched a vigorous technical innovation campaign in February, and therefore completed the monthly raw coal production plan ahead of schedule and excellently.

    增产煤炭多炼钢
    焦作、西山等矿提前完成2月产煤任务
    据新华社郑州29日电　焦作煤矿提前两天零八小时完成2月份原煤生产计划，平均日产量比1月份提高3．55％；千吨煤坑木消耗量下降为十五点零五立方米，较上月降低14％。
    这个矿职工为保证煤炭生产持续跃进，2月份深入开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。各矿党组织领导职工群众，运用领导干部、工人、技术人员“三结合”的方法，大搞技术表演赛、生产运动会、标兵选拔赛等，把比较零星、分散的先进技术和先进经验配成套，因此大大促进了生产。
    据新华社太原28日电　太原西山矿务局和潞安矿务局已提前三天超额完成2月份原煤生产计划。
    进入2月份以来，西山矿务局全面开展了以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术表演赛，促使生产效率不断提高。潞安矿务局职工在2月份也开展了热火朝天的技术革新运动，因而提前出色地完成了月度的原煤生产计划。
