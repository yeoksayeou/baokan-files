	Along the west bank of the lower reaches of the Luan River in Hebei Province, on the continuous stretch of sandy beaches, grows a large, dense forest – this is the commune-run forest farm of the Changning Commune in Leting County.

	In the past, this area was plagued by rampant wind and sand, and much of the fertile land was submerged by river sand. The blowing sand posed a serious threat to agricultural production. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the people here have launched a tree planting and afforestation campaign, but because the advanced cooperatives had limited manpower and land, the afforestation work progressed very slowly. The situation changed dramatically after the establishment of the People's Commune. In the spring of 1959, the Changning Commune mobilized more than 10,000 people at once, and in two days, they afforested more than 2,800 mu, with neat row spacing and excellent quality. In the autumn of that year, the production brigades contracted tasks and planted more than 1,000 mu of trees. In order to develop forestry production in a more planned way and consolidate the results of afforestation, the commune built a forest farm here.

	Starting anything is always difficult. To rapidly expand the forest area, it is necessary to vigorously develop tree nurseries. However, these forest farm workers, who had just come from the farmland, lacked forestry knowledge and encountered many difficulties in managing the nurseries. According to the experience introduced in books, mulberry seedlings must be grown in fields covered with shade sheds, but this would cost a lot of money. After several brainstorming sessions, they finally found a solution: using topsoil mixed with fine sand on the seedbeds to replace the shade sheds, maintaining the topsoil's looseness. More than twenty mu of mulberry seedlings were successfully cultivated using this local method without building shade sheds. To date, they have cultivated more than twenty varieties of seedlings using experience from other places and their own experiments and research. The area of fixed nurseries has increased from forty mu in the past to two hundred mu, with an annual output of more than 1.5 million seedlings. The seedling cultivation technical team has also expanded rapidly, and many workers have transformed from being "laymen" to relatively skilled technicians. The workers of the entire farm have thus brought into play their collective wisdom and aroused their revolutionary drive, and difficulties have been overcome one by one. They brought their own tools when there weren't any, collected tree seeds everywhere, dug wells when there wasn't any water, and used broken parts to assemble two waterwheels when there weren't any. To solve the housing problem, the workers managed the nurseries and pruned trees during the day, so they used the evenings to make bricks and transport lumber, spending only 300 yuan to build twenty-eight rooms. In order to fundamentally solve the economic expenses of the forest farm's production, they comprehensively planned the forest land production, intercropping corn, millet, soybeans, vegetables, and other crops in the newly planted young forest area and the newly planted orchard. Last year alone, they harvested 100,000 jin of grain, 150,000 jin of vegetables, and 120,000 jin of fodder, achieving self-sufficiency in grain, vegetables, and fodder with a surplus. In addition, the forest farm used some vacant land as pastures to raise livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and rabbits. In 1959, the total income reached more than 60,000 yuan, and after deducting production investment and employee wages, they turned over more than 33,000 yuan to the commune, expanding the commune's public accumulation.

	To the west of the forest farm, more than fifty new houses have been built, which is the new campus of the Changning Commune's Forestry Middle School. The colorful Changning Forest Farm has added a new element – the experimental field for the students of the Forestry Middle School.

    滦河西岸一片青
    穆云飞
    沿着河北省滦河下游的西岸，在绵延不断的沙滩上，生长着大片茂密的树林，这就是乐亭县长凝公社的社办林场。
    过去，这里风沙猖獗，大部良田被河沙掩没。风吹沙旋，严重的威胁着农业生产。几年来在党的领导下，这里的人们展开了植树造林工作，但是因为高级社人力少，土地少，造林工作进展很慢。人民公社成立以后情况就大不相同了。1959年春季，长凝公社一次就动员了一万多人，在两天里，就造林二千八百多亩，而且行距整齐，质量很好。当年的秋季又由各生产大队分包任务，连续种树一千多亩。为了更有计划的发展林业生产，巩固造林成果，公社在这里建起了林场。
    凡事总是起头难，要迅速的发展林业面积，需要大力发展林木苗圃。但是，这些刚从庄稼地里走来的林场职工，林业知识非常缺乏，经营苗圃遇到很多困难。按照书本的经验介绍，培育桑苗必须在田间搭盖阴棚，但是这样要花钱很多。经过几次诸葛亮会，他们终于找到了解决问题的方法，利用畦面表土掺细沙代替了阴棚，保持了表土松软。二十多亩桑苗在没有搭盖阴棚的情况下，用这个土办法培育成功了。到目前，他们利用外地经验和自己试验研究而培育出来的树苗已有二十多种，固定苗圃的面积由过去的四十亩增到二百亩，每年产苗一百五十多万株。育苗技术队伍也迅速扩大了，很多职工由过去的“门外汉”变成了比较熟练的技术人员。全场职工就这样发挥了集体智慧，鼓起了革命干劲，困难一个个被克服了。没有工具自己带，没有树籽到处采，没有水井自己挖，没有水车就利用一些破烂零件凑成两辆。为解决住的问题，职工们白天经营苗圃整修树木没时间，就利用晚上打坯搬运木料，只花了三百元就盖好二十八间房子。为了从根本上解决林场生产上的经济开支问题，他们对林地生产进行了全面规划，在新植幼林区和新植的果园内，间种了玉米、谷子、大豆、蔬菜等农作物，只去年一年就收粮十万斤，蔬菜十五万斤，饲草十二万斤，达到了粮食、蔬菜、饲草自给有余。此外林场利用一些空闲地作牧场，饲养猪、羊、鸡、兔等家畜、家禽。1959年全年收入达六万多元，除去生产投资和职工工资外，还上缴公社三万三千多元，扩大了公社的公共积累。
    林场的西面，新建了五十多间新屋，这是长凝公社的林业中学的新校址。丰富多彩的长凝林场又增添了一个新内容——林业中学学生们的试验场。
