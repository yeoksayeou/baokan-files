Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 24th: Chinese Ambassador Wang Bingnan, representative to the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, issued a statement here this afternoon at 7:00 PM (Warsaw time) regarding the sentencing of American spy criminal Harry Houghton by the Chinese judicial authorities. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　American Harry Houghton has been sentenced to imprisonment by the Chinese judicial authorities on March 18, 1960, in accordance with the law, for engaging in espionage activities and plotting to subvert the Chinese government in China. Ambassador Wang Bingnan notified US Ambassador Beam of this situation during the Warsaw meeting on March 22nd. Ambassador Beam surprisingly protested this. Ambassador Wang Bingnan flatly rejected Beam's protest, pointing out that Harry Houghton's crimes were serious, the evidence was conclusive, and there was no denying it; China, not the United States, had reason to protest. The so-called protest by the United States further confirmed that Harry Houghton's criminal activities in China were precisely a link in the US government's consistent conspiracy to subvert the Chinese government.

　　Ambassador Wang Bingnan also pointed out that the Chinese government has always protected law-abiding foreigners and respected freedom of religious belief, but will never allow imperialist spies to engage in activities to subvert the Chinese government under the guise of religious activities. As for humanitarianism, international law, and the code of conduct among civilized nations, it is precisely the United States, which insists on occupying Chinese territory, antagonizing the Chinese people, and plotting to subvert the Chinese government, that is violating these principles. The Chinese court has every right to punish any foreign spies who violate Chinese law. The dignity of Chinese law and judicial sovereignty will not allow US interference.

    出席中美会谈的我国大使王炳南发表声明
    中国法律尊严不容美国干涉
    美国的所谓抗议更证实华理柱的罪行是美国政府一贯图谋颠覆中国政府的阴谋活动中的一个环节
    新华社华沙24日电　今天下午七时（华沙时间），我出席中美大使级会谈代表王炳南大使在此间发表关于中国司法当局判处美国间谍罪犯华理柱徒刑的声明。声明全文如下：
    美国人华理柱因在中国进行间谍活动、图谋颠覆中国政府，已在1960年3月18日被中国司法当局依法判处徒刑。王炳南大使在3月22日华沙会谈中将这一情况通知了美国大使比姆。比姆大使竟然对此提出抗议。王炳南大使断然拒绝了比姆的抗议，并指出华理柱罪行严重、证据确凿、无可抵赖；有理由提出抗议的是中国，不是美国。美国的所谓抗议更加证实了华理柱在中国的犯罪活动正是美国政府一贯图谋颠覆中国政府各种阴谋活动中的一个环节。
    王炳南大使并指出，中国政府一贯保护守法的外侨，一贯尊重宗教信仰自由，但是，决不容许帝国主义间谍分子，以宗教活动为外衣，从事颠覆中国政府的活动。至于说到人道主义、国际法和文明国家之间的行为准则的话，那么，违反这些原则的恰恰是坚持侵占中国领土、敌视中国人民、阴谋颠覆中国政府的美国。中国法院有一切权利惩处违犯中国法律的任何外国的间谍分子。中国法律的尊严和司法主权决不容许美国干涉。
