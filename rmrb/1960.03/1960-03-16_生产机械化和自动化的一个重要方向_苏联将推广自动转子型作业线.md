An Important Direction for Production Mechanization and Automation
    The Soviet Union Will Promote Automatic Rotor-Type Assembly Lines
    This type of assembly line can greatly increase the efficiency of parts processing and reduce labor intensity
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th. “Pravda” recently published an article by Abramov, secretary of the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, proposing an important direction for production mechanization and automation: automatic rotor-type assembly lines. According to tests, the productivity of this type of assembly line is many times higher than that of any other type of automatic equipment. The Soviet government and party organizations have already formulated plans to promote this experience.
    The automatic rotor-type assembly line was designed by Soviet engineer Koshkin. Its basic characteristic is that the parts are processed during transportation on the assembly line. This gives the assembly line particularly great efficiency and very high productivity. On the so-called multi-variety rotor-type assembly line, several kinds of parts with different shapes and sizes but similar technological processes can be processed simultaneously. Currently, this type of assembly line can perform pressure processing (stamping, forging, etc.), heat treatment, coloring, assembly, and inspection operations very well. Methods for performing metal cutting on this type of assembly line are currently being studied.
    Abramov's article emphasizes that the rotor line production method is more advantageous than any other method in the production of some smaller parts with large production needs. Producing these parts using this method can bring the country huge benefits worth billions of rubles.
    According to tests in the Moscow Oblast, this type of assembly line is particularly effective in the production of metal products such as automobiles, agricultural machinery, instruments, as well as electrodes and battery spare parts. For example, in the battery factory in this oblast, the 24,000 battery covers that were originally produced daily by 126 workers can now be completed by two assembly lines operated by only 12 workers. In the "Sulfonated Phenol Formaldehyde Resin" factory, the use of this type of assembly line can reduce the labor intensity of producing certain plastic parts to one-fourteenth, reduce the production area to one-sixth, and reduce the number of workers engaged in the production of these parts to one-fifteenth.
    The entire cost of installing this type of rotor-type assembly line can be recovered in just a few months. This is incomparable to any other type of automatic equipment.
    Currently, the State Automation and Machine Building Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers has established a rotor-type assembly line department to formulate a plan to establish dozens of experimental rotor lines in industrial sectors. The Moscow Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, together with the National Economic Council, has compiled a catalog of parts processed by rotor lines, including approximately 800 types of parts and products of various shapes and sizes. A specialized enterprise for manufacturing rotor-type assembly lines, with its own design organization, is currently being established based on the Klin Machine Tool Factory. (Attached picture)

    生产机械化和自动化的一个重要方向
    苏联将推广自动转子型作业线
    这种作业线可以大大提高零件加工效率并减低劳动强度
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联“真理报”最近刊登苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会书记阿布拉莫夫的一篇文章，提出了生产机械化和自动化的一个重要方向——自动转子型作业线。据试验，这种作业线的生产率比其它任何型式的自动装备要高出许多倍。苏联政府和党组织已经制订计划推广这一经验。
    自动转子型作业线是苏联工程师科什金设计的。它的基本特点就是，作业线上的零件在运送过程中进行加工。这就使得作业线具有特别巨大的效率和很高的生产率。在所谓多品种转子型作业线上可以同时加工若干种外形和尺寸不同而工艺过程类似的零件。现在这种作业线已经可以很好地进行压力处理
  （冲压、锻造等等）、热处理、上色、装配以及检查等操作。目前正在研究在这种作业线上进行金属切削处理的方法。
    阿布拉莫夫的文章着重指出，在生产需要量很大的一些较小的零件方面，转子线生产方法要比其它任何方法都有利。这些零件采用这种方法生产，可为国家带来数以十亿卢布计的巨大收益。
    根据莫斯科州的试验，这种作业线在生产汽车、农业机器、仪表等金属制品和电极、蓄电池备件等方面，是特别有效益的。例如，在这个州的蓄电池工厂里，原来每天由一百二十六位工人生产的二万四千个蓄电池盖，只需要十二个工人操作的两条作业线就可以完成。在“磺烃酚醛塑胶”工厂里，使用这种作业线可以使生产某些塑料零件的劳动强度减少到十四分之一，生产场地缩减到六分之一，从事这些零件生产的工人可以缩减到十五分之一。
    安装这种转子型作业线，只要几个月就可以回收全部成本。而这是其它任何一种型式的自动装备都无法相比的。
    现在，苏联部长会议国家自动化和机器制造委员会已经建立了一个转子型作业线部来制订在工业部门建立几十条试验性转子线的计划。苏共莫斯科州委已经同国民经济委员会一起编制出了转子线加工零件目录，目录上包括约八百种各种型式和尺寸的零件和制品。目前正在以克林机床厂为基础建立一个带有自己设计机构的制造转子型作业线的专门企业。（附图片）
