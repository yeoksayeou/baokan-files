Xinhua News Agency, March 26th, Paris dispatch: According to TASS from Paris, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, after visiting the former residence of Lenin in Paris on the morning of the 25th, continued talks with French President de Gaulle at the Élysée Palace.

On the afternoon of the 25th, Khrushchev and his entourage attended a banquet held in his honor by the French Association of Diplomatic Journalists. Khrushchev was welcomed by French journalists and journalists from other countries attending the banquet. Khrushchev delivered a speech after the banquet.

Khrushchev expressed the hope that the Soviet Union and France would expand contacts and ties in all aspects. He said that broad cooperation between the Soviet Union and France would increase France's friends and also increase the Soviet Union's friends, and would not, as some newspapers have said, "harm the harmony between France and its Western allies." He said that we came to France to jointly formulate ways to further develop Soviet-French friendly relations with its government.

Referring to the upcoming summit conference, Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union believes that the main purpose of the conference is to seek a common language and common methods for the peaceful resolution of these issues on controversial international issues.

Referring to the issue of disarmament, Khrushchev refuted the Western argument that arms must be stepped up to achieve a "balance of power." He pointed out that this argument is an excuse for the arms race. Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union proposes taking a positive attitude to resolve the issue of disarmament. The Soviet Union's disarmament proposals should not simply be dismissed with a shake of the head or regarded as "propaganda." Let other countries also engage in this kind of "propaganda" and unilaterally greatly reduce their armed forces.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that the Soviet government will continue to steadfastly strive to further ease international tensions in the future, and the Soviet Union will spare no effort to promote the development of the international situation along the path of strengthening peace and friendship among nations.

Khrushchev answered questions raised by reporters after his speech.

In the afternoon, Khrushchev attended the opening ceremony of the joint Soviet-French exhibition "Documents on Soviet-French Relations," which reflects the traditional friendly ties between the Soviet Union and France. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech. He pointed out that the history of relations between the two countries over many centuries shows that when these two largest continental countries in Europe form an alliance, those who are hostile to them have to consider the strength of this alliance. He also said that the commonality of the tasks of the Soviet Union and France in ensuring their security and the security of Europe creates good preconditions for expanding the economic, political and cultural ties between the two countries, for jointly strengthening peace and striving to establish a European collective security system.

Later, Khrushchev held talks with a large number of members of the French National Assembly and Senate at his residence. The members of parliament who met with Khrushchev included Schumitran, Chairman of the French National Assembly France-Soviet Friendship Group, Buchi, Vice Chairman of the French Senate France-Soviet Friendship Group, French Communist Party members Dorlez, Duclos and other people belonging to different political parties.

In the evening, Khrushchev and de Gaulle watched the famous French composer Bizet's opera "Carmen" at the French "Grand Opera House."

On the morning of the 26th, Khrushchev and his entourage left Paris by plane for Bordeaux.

    赫鲁晓夫继续在巴黎访问
    发表演说指出西方所谓“实力平衡”论调是为军备竞赛辩解
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫25日晨参观了在巴黎的列宁故居后同法国总统戴高乐在爱丽舍宫继续会谈。
    25日下午，赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员出席了法国外交记者协会为他举行的宴会。赫鲁晓夫受到参加宴会的法国记者和其他国家记者的欢迎。赫鲁晓夫在宴会后发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫表示希望苏法两国在各方面扩大接触和联系。他说，苏联和法国广泛的合作将增加法国的朋友，也将增加苏联的朋友，而且也不会像一部分报纸所说的那样“损害法国和它的西方盟国的和睦”。他说，我们到法国来是为了同它的政府共同拟定进一步发展苏法友好关系的途径。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到即将举行的最高级会议时指出，苏联认为，会议的主要目的在于，在有争执的国际问题上寻求共同的语言和共同和平解决这些问题的方法。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到裁军问题时驳斥了西方所谓必须加紧武装以取得“实力平衡”的论调。他指出，这种论调是为军备竞赛辩解的。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联建议采取积极态度来解决裁军问题。对于苏联的裁军建议不能简单地摇摇头或看作是“宣传”。让别的国家也来进行这种“宣传”，并单方面地大大裁减自己的武装部队吧。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联政府今后仍将坚定不移地为进一步缓和国际紧张局势而奋斗，苏联将不惜力量来促使国际局势沿着加强各国和平和友谊的道路发展。
    赫鲁晓夫在演说后答复了记者们提出的问题。
    下午，赫鲁晓夫出席了苏联和法国联合举办的“苏联和法国关系文献”展览会的开幕式，这个展览会反映了苏、法两国传统的友好联系。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯主持了开幕式并在会上致词。他指出，许多世纪来两国关系的历史表明，当欧洲这两个最大的大陆国家结成同盟时，同它们为敌的人就不得不考虑这个同盟的实力。他还说，苏法两国在保障它们的和欧洲的安全方面的任务的共同性，为扩大这两国的经济、政治和文化联系，为共同加强和平、争取建立欧洲集体安全体系创造了良好的前提。
    以后，赫鲁晓夫在他的寓所同法国国民议会和参议院的大批议员进行了谈话。同赫鲁晓夫会见的议员中包括法国国民议会法苏友好小组主席许米特兰、法国参议院法苏友好小组副主席布希、法国共产党议员多列士、杜克洛和其他属于不同政党的人士。
    晚上，赫鲁晓夫同戴高乐一起在法国“大歌剧院”观看了著名的法国作曲家比才的歌剧“卡门”。
    26日上午，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员乘飞机离开巴黎前往波尔多。
