Shanxi is focusing on weak links in production this year, vigorously transforming low-yield areas and low-yield fields, which has led to a general upsurge and overall leap forward in current spring production work.

After investigation and ranking by various regions in Shanxi Province, there are approximately 15 million mu of low-yield fields, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the province's cultivated land. These low-yield fields are mostly distributed in the Lüliang, Wutai, and Taihang mountainous areas, as well as some low-lying and saline-alkali areas in the plains. After liberation, through land reform and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, especially since the realization of communization, yields have continuously increased, even doubling. However, because these areas have thick stones and thin soil, vast land and sparse population, and rough cultivation with deeply ingrained historical habits, coupled with a lack of water conservancy facilities, the rate of yield increase is slower compared to cultivated land in areas with better conditions. Secondly, the 41% of the province's wheat fields that are planted with replanted wheat, due to replanting after the wheat harvest, late sowing, and insufficient fertilizer, have yields per unit area far lower than wheat fields that are not replanted. This greatly affects the high-speed and comprehensive development of agricultural production in the province. Therefore, transforming low-yield areas and low-yield fields has become the decisive key to improving agricultural production in the province and achieving continued leaps forward.

In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels in Shanxi Province have adopted the method of putting politics in command, strengthening Party leadership, and mobilizing the masses to carry out ideological and technological revolutions since last winter. The Jin southeast area universally discussed the high-yield typical example that emerged in a low-yield area during the first year of people's communization – the Lucun Commune in Tunliu County – thereby universally establishing ambitious goals to eliminate low-yield areas and low-yield fields in 1960. The Jin north area held cadre meetings in poor management areas, backward management areas, and disaster-stricken management areas, criticizing the ideas of "only conditions matter," backwardness, and being content with low yields, overcoming negative emotions. They also specifically analyzed the favorable conditions brought about by the Great Leap Forward and people's communes for transforming low-yield areas and low-yield fields, greatly mobilizing positive factors. All low-yield areas and communes/management areas with low-yield fields in the area boosted their morale, formulated plans to surpass and catch up with the level of local wealthy management areas.

To ensure the transformation of low-yield areas and low-yield fields, various regions have taken a series of measures to strengthen leadership and support for low-yield areas. Under the unified arrangement of the Party committees, a group of leading cadres and technical personnel were dispatched to lead and research measures to transform low yields into high yields, and "experimental fields" were universally established. The Jin southeast area also convened a field conference for cadres from low-yield counties, communes, and management areas at the Lucun Commune in Tunliu County to exchange experiences on transforming low yields into high yields in one year. The Jin south District Committee of the Communist Party of China also launched a "plain helps mountain" collaboration throughout the district, organizing thirteen plain counties to support mountainous low-yield counties in terms of mechanical power and other aspects. To solve the fertilizer problem in cotton and wheat producing areas, the Shanxi Province leadership departments prioritized concentrating support for chemical fertilizers. The masses in low-yield areas reflected: "Ideas are clear, methods are new, and support comes from all sides."

By adopting the above methods, the province has already built five million mu of terraced fields on low-yield slopes and improved more than six million mu of soil. The amount of fertilizer accumulated and applied in all low-yield areas and low-yield fields has doubled compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 26th. The people of Shandong are firmly relying on large-area high-yield wheat plots as a battleground to win an all-round victory in the wheat's greening stage. Currently, wheat throughout the province is growing luxuriantly due to sufficient water and fertilizer. The large areas of high-yield fields have expanded from more than 20 million mu to 30 million mu. Many high-yield wheat seedlings, on the basis of universal topdressing and irrigation last winter, have received two additional waterings and two additional fertilizations, growing like chives, generally reaching six to seven inches in height, with four to five tillers per plant, averaging around one million to one and a half million plants per mu.

The rapid development of large-area high-yield wheat plots not only demonstrates the achievements of wheat field management but also vividly shows the superiority of the larger size and higher degree of public ownership of the people's communes. It not only connects small plots of land into large garden fields, which can promote comprehensive and balanced yield increases, but more importantly, it has triggered a major revolution in the entire agricultural cropping system and accelerated the pace of basic farmland construction. For example, advanced counties and cities such as Linqing, Gaotang, and Licheng, and regions with developed commune-run industries, have selected key plots, equipping them as model high-yield plots with mechanization, semi-mechanization, and partial electrification, or turning them into "five-red bases" with red ideology, red production, red technology, red culture, and red talent cultivation. These high-yield wheat fields are managed as meticulously as embroidery, striving for perfection, becoming better and better.

To build the 30 million mu of large-area high-yield wheat plots into a solid grain production base, comprehensive arrangements have been made from ideological leadership to scientific research, from production and life to cultural learning. Counties, communes, and teams have all established high-yield plot management committees or headquarters, equipped with full-time cadres for leadership, responsible for ideological mobilization, production tasks, and technological revolution, from the major battle of the wheat greening stage to the summer harvest, from spring sowing to autumn harvest, contracting for responsibility, and grasping from beginning to end. Many communes' ten-thousand-mu plots have agricultural science research stations, meteorological stations, and red and expert schools; thousand-mu plots have scientific and technical groups; and hundred-mu plots have technicians, meteorologists, pest and disease observers, soil surveyors, and archivists. Some high-yield plots have also established temporary residences, set up field canteens, and brought the four types of schools (Party schools, Youth League schools, technical night schools, and spare-time cultural schools) to the fields, along with medical and health services, agricultural tool repair, and so on. Some have also installed a set of advanced propaganda tools such as telephones, loudspeakers, and wired broadcasting in the high-yield plots, truly turning the high-yield plots into a strong fortress for the production, life, and political and cultural learning of the vast number of commune members, as well as wheat field management.

Party committees at all levels rely on high-yield fields to provide strong support and technical guidance to general fields and third-category seedlings, enabling all types of wheat seedlings to be upgraded and achieve an all-round leap forward. Of the province's total of 7.87 million mu of third-category seedlings, 3.16 million mu have been upgraded. Preliminary investigations show that among the more than 68 million mu of wheat, first-category seedlings account for more than 54%, second-category seedlings account for about 36%, and third-category seedlings account for about 10%, changing the situation of a large middle and small ends of previous years.

    山西大力改造低产区低产田  山东迅速发展大面积丰产方
    本报太原26日电　山西省今年突出地抓生产落后环节，大力改造低产区低产田，已使当前春季生产工作共同高涨全面跃进。
    山西省经过各地调查排队共有一千五百万亩左右低产田。占全省耕地面积近四分之一。这些低产田大部分分布在吕梁、五台、太行山区和部分平川低洼、盐碱化地区。这些低产田解放以后经过土地改革和互助合作运动，特别是实现公社化以来，产量都不断提高，而且成倍提高，但是由于这些地区石厚土薄、地广人稀、耕作粗糙，历史习惯没有根除，再加以缺乏水利设施，比起条件较好的地区耕地增产速度就显得落后了一步。其次，占全省麦田总面积41％的回茬麦地，由于麦收后进行复种，播种晚土地不能休闲，肥料不足，单位面积产量远远赶不上不进行复种的麦田。这就大大影响到全省农业生产高速度全面发展。因此，改造低产区低产田就成了提高全省农业生产实现继续跃进的决定性的关键。
    针对这一情况，山西省各级党委从去冬开始，就采取了政治挂帅，加强党的领导，发动群众大搞思想革命和技术革新的办法。晋东南专区普遍讨论了人民公社化第一年在低产区涌现出来的高产典型——屯长县路村公社，从而普遍树雄心立大志，要把低产区低产田消灭在1960年。晋北专区各县分别召开了穷管理区、后进管理区和遭灾管理区的干部会议，一方面批判了唯条件论、落后论和甘居低产的思想，克服消极情绪；一方面具体分析大跃进、人民公社为改造低产区低产田带来的有利条件，大调积极因素，全区所有低产区和有低产田的公社、管理区都鼓起斗志，制出计划，都要超过和赶上当地富裕管理区水平。
    为了保证低产区低产田翻身，各地采取了一系列措施加强了低产区的领导和支援。各地在党委的统一安排下，都抽调了一批领导干部和技术人员领导和研究低产变高产的措施，普遍建了“试验田”。晋东南专区还召集低产县、公社、管理区干部在屯长县路村公社召开了一年由低产变高产的经验交流现场会议。中共晋南地委还在全专区开展了“川帮山”大协作，组织十三个平川县从机械动力等方面对山区低产县进行支援。为了解决棉麦产区肥料问题，山西省领导部门优先集中支援化肥。低产区群众反映：思想明朗办法新，多方支援送上门。
    采取以上办法，目前全省已在低产坡地上修好梯田五百万亩；改良土壤六百多万亩，所有低产区低产田积肥和施肥数量比去年增加了一倍。
    本报济南26日电　山东人民紧紧依靠大面积麦田丰产方为阵地，夺取小麦返青的全面胜利。现在，全省小麦由于水勤肥足，生长茂盛，大面积丰产田，已由二千多万亩扩大到三千万亩，很多丰产麦苗，在去冬普追普浇的基础上，又施到两水两肥，长得像韭菜一样，一般都长到六、七寸高，每株分蘖四、五个，每亩平均一百万株到一百五十万株左右。
    小麦大面积丰产方的迅速发展，不但表明了麦田管理的成就，而且最生动地显示了人民公社一大二公的优越性。它不仅把小块土地联成大块园田，可以促进全面平衡增产，更重要的是，它引起了整个农业耕作制度上的大革命，加速了农田基本建设的步伐。例如临清、高唐、历城等先进县市和社办工业发达的地区，选择重点方田，装备成机械化、半机械化和部分电气化的标兵丰产方，或者把它变成了思想红、生产红、技术红、文化红、培养人材红等“五红基地”。这些丰产麦田，管理得如同绣花一样，精益求精，越管越好。
    为了把三千万亩小麦大面积丰产方建设成为稳固的粮食生产基地，从思想领导到科学研究，从生产生活到文化学习都配起套来。县、社、队都建立丰产方管理委员会或指挥部，配备专职干部领导，按方包思想发动，包生产任务，包技术革命，从大战小麦返青关到夏收，从春播到秋收，包干负责，一抓到底。许多公社的万亩方都有农业科学研究站、气象站、红专学校，千亩方有科学技术组，百亩方有技术员、气象员、病虫观察员、土壤测报员、档案员。有些丰产方还建立了临时居住点，办起了田间食堂，党校、团校、技术夜校、业余文化学校等四校到方，医药卫生、农具修配到方等等。还有的在丰产方内安装了电话、喇叭、有线广播等一套先进的宣传工具，把丰产方真正变成广大社员的生产、生活和政治文化学习中心以及麦田管理的坚强堡垒。
    各级党委依靠丰产田对一般田和三类苗，给予大力的支援和技术指导，使各类麦苗节节升级，全面跃进。全省共有七百八十七万亩三类苗，已有三百十六万亩升级。初步调查表明，在六千八百多万亩小麦中一类苗已占54％以上，二类苗占36％左右，三类苗占10％左右，改变了历年中间大两头小的局面。
