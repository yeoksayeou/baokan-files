Unified Vehicle Inspection Ensures "One-Dragon" Transportation
    Shenyang Railway Bureau and Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Practices Further Unleash Transportation Potential

    (Our report) Shenyang Railway Bureau and Benxi Iron and Steel Company, on the basis of carrying out "One-Dragon" transportation great collaboration, the railway and the factory are also collaborating to protect the "dragon" and ensure the "dragon", implementing unified inspection, unified repair, and unified care of vehicles, further tapping into transportation potential. The reduction of vehicle dwell time alone is equivalent to adding more than 290 operational vehicles to the country every month on average; and it has greatly improved the quality of vehicle maintenance, with the qualified rate of trains consistently maintained above 94%.

    Since the railway and factory implemented the "One-Dragon" transportation great collaboration, both parties felt that if corresponding changes were not made in the technical and business management of vehicles, personnel organization, technical operation processes, and vehicle maintenance, the potential of vehicles could not be further realized. In the past, both parties had vehicle inspectors at the handover points, handling the handover according to the constraints of the contract. And both parties had different conditions and constraints. Some railway vehicles loaded with goods destined for Benxi Steel could not directly enter Benxi Steel; and for vehicles returning from Benxi Steel after unloading, railway vehicle inspectors, according to contractual constraints, would not repair some that could be repaired. This not only affected transportation but also affected production.

    In order to change this situation, the Benxi Vehicle Depot of the Shenyang Railway Administration and the Transportation Department of Benxi Iron and Steel Company held several railway-factory vehicle worker collaboration meetings, conducted discussions, further clarified the importance of railway-factory collaboration in protecting the "dragon" and ensuring the "dragon," and established the communist spirit that the railway and factory are one family. Both parties, in the vehicle work of the railway and factory, broke boundaries and abolished the constraints of the original contract.

    On the basis of unified thinking, unified inspection and unified repair were implemented for both railway cars and Benxi Steel cars. If railway cars were damaged inside the Benxi Steel factory, the railway side would take the initiative to repair them. The required materials and accessories were mutually supported and shared, based on the principle of local availability. In order to prevent vehicle damage due to careless loading and unloading or shunting operations, both parties took preventive measures, uniformly established a vehicle care system, and launched a mass vehicle care campaign. Railway and factory vehicle personnel regularly conducted vehicle care publicity in various factories, mines, workshops, and vehicle-using units, and put forward suggestions and requirements for vehicle care measures. According to preliminary statistics, each mechanized loading and unloading point can reduce an average of 150 damaged and faulty vehicles and 300 empty vehicles leaving the factory per month.

    After implementing these measures, the technical handover procedures for vehicles were reduced. The previous four procedures were reduced to one unified inspection and credit handover by the railway for vehicles leaving the factory. This not only reduced duplicate operations but also shortened the single operation time of vehicles and accelerated vehicle turnaround. At the same time, the quality of train and vehicle maintenance has been significantly improved, ensuring transportation safety. There have been no train delays for six consecutive months.

### 统一检修车辆　保证“一条龙”运输  沈阳铁路局和本溪钢铁公司的作法进一步发挥了运输潜力

    统一检修车辆　保证“一条龙”运输
    沈阳铁路局和本溪钢铁公司的作法进一步发挥了运输潜力
    本报讯　沈阳铁路局和本溪钢铁公司在开展“一条龙”运输大协作的基础上，路厂又协作护龙保龙，实行车辆统一检查、统一修理和统一爱护，进一步挖掘了运输潜力。仅车辆缩短停留的时间，就等于平均每月给国家增加运用车二百九十多辆；并且大大提高了车辆的检修质量，列车合格率经常保持在94％以上。
    自从路厂实行了“一条龙”运输大协作以后，双方感到如果在车辆的技术业务管理上，人员组织上、技术作业过程上及车辆维修保养上不作相应的改变，车辆的潜力便不能得到更大的发挥。过去双方在交接线上都设有检车人员，按照合同的约束办理交接。而双方都有不同条件的约束，铁路车辆有的装往本钢的货物不能直接进入本钢；由本钢装卸后返出的车辆，路方检车人员按照合同约束，有的能修的也不修。这不仅影响运输，也影响生产。
    为了改变这种情况，沈阳铁路管理局本溪车辆段和本溪钢铁公司运输部，曾先后召开几次路厂车辆职工协作会议，进行了座谈讨论，进一步明确了路厂协作对护龙保龙的重要性，树立了路厂是一家的共产主义风格。双方在路厂车辆工作上，打破界限，废除了原合同的约束。
    在统一思想的基础上，不论铁路车还是本钢车，都实行了统一检查，统一修理。铁路车在本钢厂内发生破损，铁路方面便主动修理，所需材料、配件，本着就地取用的原则，互相支援，互通有无。为了防止由于装卸不慎或调车作业冲撞以致损坏车辆，双方都采取了预防措施，统一建立了爱护车辆的制度，开展了群众性的爱车运动，路厂车辆人员经常到各厂矿车间、各用车单位进行爱车宣传，并向他们提出爱车措施的建议和要求。据初步统计，各机械化装卸地点，平均每月可减少一百五十破损故障车辆和减少空车出厂三百辆。
    实行这些办法以后，减少了车辆技术交接手续，过去的四道工序，减少为出厂的车辆路方一次统一检查信用交接。这样既减少了重复作业，又缩短了车辆一次作业时间，加速了车辆周转。同时，列车和车辆检修质量有显著提高，保证了运输安全，曾连续六个月没有发生列车晚点现象。
