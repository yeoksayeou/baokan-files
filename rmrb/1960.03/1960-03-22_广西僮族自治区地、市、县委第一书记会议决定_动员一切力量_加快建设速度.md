Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Prefectural, Municipal, and County Party Committee First Secretaries' Conference Decides
    Mobilize All Forces and Accelerate Construction Speed

    (Our dispatch) To better continue implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, adhere to taking agriculture as the foundation, and under the condition of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, implement the Party's policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture to achieve the continued leap forward in the national economy in 1960, mobilize the strength of the entire Party and all the people, resolutely overcome all difficulties, and accelerate the speed of construction to lay a favorable foundation for rapidly changing Guangxi's backward industrial outlook. This is the basic task for Guangxi's development of the national economy plan for 1960 proposed by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China at the conference of first secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county party committees held from February 10th to 20th.
    The meeting listened to Comrade He Ximing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the "Report (Draft) on the National Economic Plan for 1960," and after repeated discussions, Comrade Wu Jinnan, Secretary of the Secretariat, gave a summary of the conference. During the discussion of the draft of Guangxi's 1960 National Economic Plan, the comrades present analyzed the excellent international and domestic situation, especially the current excellent situation in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, summarized the experiences of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, and improved their consciousness in studying Mao Zedong Thought. After listening to the report (draft) of the Guangxi 1960 National Economic Plan, everyone unanimously believed that it was a plan for sustained leap forward, felt very excited, and expressed their determination to do a good job in their respective regions to ensure the realization of the plan.
    The meeting believed that 1959, like the rest of the country, was a year of great leap forward in Guangxi's national economy. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the entire region increased by 30.5% compared to 1958. Other transportation, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, etc., also greatly overfulfilled the original planned targets. And at the beginning of this year, the situation on the industrial and agricultural fronts is particularly good again. In February, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, on the industrial and transportation front of the autonomous region, entered a new stage on the basis of pace-setter competitions and team competitions, through rectification and socialist education, forming a magnificent and surging high tide. Due to the extensive and in-depth development of the movement, the comprehensive overfulfillment of the production plan was guaranteed. In February, the total industrial output value of the region increased by 7.6% compared to January; the average daily output value in January and February increased by 35.07% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. By the end of March, the accumulated completion of the quarterly plan was 76.57%. In agriculture, due to the further consolidation and development of the people's communes, its superiority has become more apparent. Under the unified leadership, hierarchical management, and rational allocation of labor by the communes, large-scale water conservancy projects were undertaken last winter and this spring, increasing the water-retaining irrigation area by seven million mu in the entire region. Last year's winter crops amounted to 13.39 million mu, an increase of 176% compared to the 4.84 million mu in 1958. As of the end of January this year, the average amount of fertilizer per mu was 250 dan, of which the amount of refined fertilizer increased by more than double compared to last year. In addition, like the technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial front, the reform of rural industries is also developing towards partial mechanization and semi-mechanization. The arrangement of rural life has been basically implemented, especially the grain situation is better than last year, which is extremely beneficial to further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. Now, whether in urban or rural areas, the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, is being carried out on a large scale and comprehensively, creating a good start for the sustained leap forward in 1960.
    In order to realize the continued leap forward in 1960, the meeting believed that it is necessary to combine taking agriculture as the foundation, prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and rapidly developing agriculture, and correctly handle the proportional relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. Only when the proportions of industry and agriculture are coordinated can the entire national economy develop at a high speed. Taking agriculture as the foundation and rapidly developing agriculture is not only not contradictory to prioritizing the development of heavy industry, but also mutually conditional and mutually promoting. Agriculture should take grain as the key, and at the same time, attention should be paid to the comprehensive development of cash crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Corresponding arrangements should be made for Guangxi's main light industrial raw materials: sugarcane, tobacco, and hemp. Taking agriculture as the foundation and rapidly developing agriculture requires strengthening industrial support for agriculture to promote the technological transformation of agriculture, gradually realizing agricultural mechanization, and ensuring the continued leap forward in agricultural production. Industrial departments should complete the manufacturing tasks of materials and equipment allocated for agricultural use on time, with quality and quantity guaranteed, and ensure complete sets of supplies. Commercial and material departments should do a good job in organizing, allocating, and transporting the sources of production materials, ensuring timely supply without delaying the farming season. Focusing on intensive farming and increasing yield per unit area on the one hand, and expanding planting area and harvesting more on the other hand, are two extremely important measures to realize the continued leap forward in agriculture this year. Now, the expanded planting area in the entire region has exceeded 10 million mu. At present, it is necessary to ensure that 14 million mu of early rice are planted during the transplanting season, planted early, planted well, and managed well to achieve a bumper harvest regardless of rain for early rice and intercropped dryland crops, and achieve a great increase in production despite severe drought. The meeting emphasized that there should not be any complacency or 麻痹思想 because of last year's bumper harvest and this year's production preparations being better than last year. We must think of the worst and prepare to overcome all kinds of difficulties, and every link must be tightly connected and never relaxed. From now on, we should be fully vigilant against drought, make preparations, vigorously carry out drought prevention and resistance, greatly accumulate animal, plant, and mineral fertilizers, rapidly develop pig raising, sow green fodder, eliminate pregnancy failures in pigs, and do a good job in epidemic prevention.
    While industry supports agriculture, agriculture must also vigorously support industry, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and ensure the key construction of industry. This year, Guangxi's key industrial construction project tasks are huge. The completion of these key projects is a crucial measure related to changing Guangxi's backward industrial outlook, rapidly catching up with the national level, promoting the technological transformation of agriculture, and laying the foundation for future industrialization. The meeting called on: the entire Party and the people of the entire region must make the greatest efforts and do everything possible to support key projects, provide people when needed, provide raw materials when needed, and ensure the smooth completion of these key projects. On the entire industrial front, it is also necessary to further strengthen leadership, continue to carry out the socialist education movement against right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigorous efforts, combine the current mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy with technological innovation and technological revolution, and fully utilize the potential power of people and materials.
    In order to better implement the general line and ensure the sustained leap forward in socialist construction, the meeting particularly emphasized the need to conscientiously and systematically study Mao Zedong's works, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to transform the objective world and the subjective world. This is an important political task for the entire Party in Guangxi. Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership over learning, make plans, and establish a regular learning system; at the same time, expand the theoretical ranks and strengthen theoretical work.

    广西僮族自治区地、市、县委第一书记会议决定
    动员一切力量  加快建设速度
    本报讯　更好地继续贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，坚持以农业为基础，在优先发展重工业的条件下执行党的建设实行工农业同时并举的方针，实现1960年国民经济的继续  跃进，动员全党全民的力量，坚决克服一切困难，加快建设速度，为迅速改变广西工业落后面貌打下有利基础。这是中共广西僮族自治区委员会在2月10日至20日召开的地、市、县委第一书记会议上，提出的1960年广西发展国民经济计划的基本任务。
    会议听取了中共广西僮族自治区委员会书记处书记贺希明同志“关于1960年国民经济计划的报告”（草案），经过反复讨论，最后由书记处书记伍晋南同志作了大会总结。在讨论广西1960年国民经济计划草案时，到会同志分析了国际、国内特别是广西僮族自治区当前的大好形势，总结了两年大跃进的经验，提高了学习毛泽东思想的自觉性。听了广西1960年国民经济计划（草案）的报告，大家一致认为，它是一个持续的跃进计划，感到十分兴奋，表示决心搞好本地区的工作，保证计划的实现。
    会议认为，1959年广西和全国一样，是国民经济大跃进的一年。全区工农业总产值比1958年增长30．5％。其他交通运输、商业、文化教育事业等，也都大大超额完成了原定的计划指标。而今年一开始，工农业战线上的形势又特别好。2月份自治区工业交通战线以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，在标兵赛、班组赛的基础上，通过整风和社会主义教育，进入了一个新的阶段，形成一个波澜壮阔，汹涌澎湃的高潮。由于运动的广泛深入开展，保证了生产计划的全面超额完成。2月份全区工业总产值比1月份增长7．6％；1、2月份平均日产值比去年第四季度增长35．07％。到3月底止，累计完成季计划76．57％。在农业方面，由于人民公社的进一步巩固和发展，更加显示它的优越性。在公社统一领导、分级管理和合理调配劳动力之下，去冬今春大兴水利，全区增加了保水灌溉面积七百万亩，去年冬种作物一千三百三十九万亩，比1958年的四百八十四万亩增长了176％，积肥到今年元月底止，平均每亩有肥料二百五十担，其中精肥比去年增加一倍多，此外，与工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命一样，农村的工改革也正朝着部分机械化、半机械化的方向发展，农村生活安排已基本落实，特别是粮食的形势比去年好，这样对进一步发挥群众的积极性极为有利。现在不论城乡和农村，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约的群众运动，正在大规模的全面开展，为1960年持续跃进，创立了良好的开端。
    为了实现1960年的继续跃进，会议认为，必须以农业为基础，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合，正确处理农、轻、重之间的比例关系，只有工农业的比例协调了，整个国民经济才能高速度的发展。以农业为基础，迅速发展农业，同优先发展重工业，不仅没有矛盾，而且是互为条件，互相促进的。农业以粮为纲，同时应注意经济作物和林、牧、副、渔的全面发展，对广西主要轻工业原料：甘蔗、烟、麻要作出相应安排。以农业为基础，迅速发展农业，必须加强工业对农业的支援，以促进农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业机械化，保证农业生产的继续跃进。工业部门应该把分配给农业用的材料和设备，按时、按质、按量完成制造任务，保证成套供应；商业和物资部门应该做好生产资料的货源组织、分配和调运工作，保证及时供应，不误农时。一手抓精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，一手抓扩种，多种多收，这是实现今年农业继续跃进的两项极为重要的措施。现在，全区扩种面积已突破一千万亩以上。目前，要保证一千四百万亩早稻抢上插秧季节，早插，插好，管好，实现早稻和间种播种的旱地作物无雨保丰收，大旱大增产。会议强调，不能因为去年丰收，今年的生产准备又比去年好，而有任何一点自满和麻痹思想。必须从坏处着想，准备克服各种各样的困难，要环环扣紧，毫不放松。从现在起，就应充分警惕旱灾，作好准备，大力进行防旱抗旱；大积动、植、矿肥，迅速发展养猪，播种青饲料，消灭猪的空怀，作好防疫工作。
    与工业支援农业的同时，农业也必须大力支援工业，加强工农联盟，保证工业的重点建设。今年，广西工业基建重点工程任务巨大。这些重点工程的建成，是关系到改变广西工业落后面貌、迅速赶上全国水平、促进农业的技术改造、为今后工业化打下基础的带关键性的措施。会议号召：全党全区人民必须尽最大努力，千方百计支援重点工程，要人有人，要原料给原料，保证这些重点工程的顺利建成，在整个工业战线上，还必须进一步加强领导，继续开展反右倾、鼓干劲的社会主义教育运动，把当前群众性的增产节约运动和技术革新技术革命结合起来，充分发挥人和物的潜在力量。
    为了更好的贯彻执行总路线，保证社会主义事业的持续跃进，会议特别强调认真系统地学习毛泽东著作，以毛泽东思想作指导，改造客观世界和主观世界。这是广西全党的重要政治任务。各级党委应加强对学习的领导，作出规划，建立经常的学习制度；同时，扩大理论队伍，加强理论工作。
