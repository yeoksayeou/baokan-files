    Malaya Postpones Local Council Elections Again
    Kuala Lumpur dispatch: The government of the Federation of Malaya announced on the 11th that it would postpone the elections for all 117 autonomous municipal, city, and village-level local councils across the country again until April next year. According to the "Local Government Election Ordinance," the current local councils at all levels should have been re-elected last year. However, it is reported that the ruling MCA-MIC Alliance was worried that holding elections at that time with the opposition parties being strong would be detrimental to itself, so it decided to postpone the elections for a year.
