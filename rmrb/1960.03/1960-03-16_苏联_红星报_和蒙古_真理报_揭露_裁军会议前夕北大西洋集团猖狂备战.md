Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th. The Soviet "Red Star" published an article today saying that the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is frantically stepping up its war preparations on the eve of the opening of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting. One of the most dangerous and provocative measures in this regard is the decision to establish a multi-national mobile special nuclear force equipped with nuclear weapons. The article said that it is very obvious that the purpose of announcing this aggressive plan on the eve of the start of important international negotiations is to create new obstacles in the path of eliminating the "Cold War" and stopping the arms race.

    The article pointed out that the provocative action of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization leadership in announcing the establishment of a multi-national mobile special nuclear force on the eve of the start of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference has been openly endorsed by the US leadership group. The article said that there is no doubt that the establishment of this force is the proposal of the US Pentagon, which came up with this idea to strengthen the US "military aid" to Western European countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and further turn their armed forces into appendages of the US military. The Pentagon also plans to continue to strengthen its military activities in Europe in the future in order to turn the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive group into a "nuclear power," thereby strengthening the US's nuclear potential on the European continent.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 15th. The Mongolian "Truth" published an editorial today saying that the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee should conduct serious discussions on the basis of a full understanding of the Soviet proposals, and achieve practical results expected by the people of the world in the area of complete and thorough disarmament, instead of getting bogged down in endless empty talk.

    The editorial said that the countries of the North Atlantic Group are massively expanding their armaments, and are reviving and arming the West German aggressive army with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. The Bonn reactionary government, headed by Adenauer, is frantically expanding its army and preparing for war and establishing military bases in foreign countries with a revanchist heart. In Asia, the United States is arming and reviving Japanese militarism with new weapons, turning Japanese territory into US military bases. The editorial emphasized that warmongers do not want to resolve international disputes through negotiations, and attempt to hinder agreements on issues that could be resolved through negotiations. The fact that the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Tests has lasted for a year and a half without any practical results is a good proof of this.

    The editorial also said that the whole world clearly sees that the US government is repeatedly delaying the talks on the pretext of some minor technical issues, and hindering an agreement on the complete prohibition of nuclear tests as the first step towards disarmament.

    苏联“红星报”和蒙古“真理报”揭露
    裁军会议前夕北大西洋集团猖狂备战
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联“红星报”今天发表文章说，北大西洋公约组织领导机构在十国裁军委员会开会的前夕猖狂地加紧了备战活动。这方面最危险的挑衅性措施之一就是关于建立配备核武器的多国家机动特种核部队的决定。文章说，十分明显，在重要的国际谈判开始的前夕宣布这一侵略性计划，其目的是为了在消除“冷战”和停止军备竞赛的道路上制造新的障碍。
    文章指出，在十国裁军会议开始的前夕北大西洋公约组织领导机构宣布建立多国家机动特种核部队，这一挑衅行动特别得到了美国领导集团的公开赞同。文章说，毫无疑问，建立这种部队是美国五角大楼的主张，出这一主意是为了加强美国对北大西洋公约集团中西欧国家的“军事援助”，并进一步把它们的武装部队变成美国军队的附属品。五角大楼还计划在今后继续加强在欧洲的军事活动，以便把北大西洋公约侵略集团变成“核强国”，从而加强美国在欧洲大陆的核潜力。
    新华社乌兰巴托15日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表社论说，十国裁军委员会应该在充分理解苏联建议的基础上进行认真讨论，并在全面彻底裁军问题方面达到全世界人民期望的实际结果，而不应该使它陷入无休止的空谈。
    社论说，北大西洋集团各国正在大量扩充军备，并且复活和以核武器及火箭武器来武装西德侵略军，以阿登纳为首的波恩反动政府怀着复仇主义的心正在疯狂地扩军备战和在外国建立军事基地。在亚洲，美国正在以新式武器武装和复活日本军国主义，把日本的土地变成美国的军事基地。社论强调说，好战分子不希望通过谈判解决国际争端问题，并且企图阻挠就那些本来有条件通过谈判解决的问题达成协议。关于不继续核试验的日内瓦会议已经延续一年半之久，但毫无实际结果的事实就是个很好的证明。
    社论又说，全世界都清楚地看到美国政府以一些细小的技术问题作为借口一再拖延会谈，阻挠就作为裁军第一步的关于彻底禁止核试验问题达成协议。
