Xinhua News Agency, London, March 21st: The African Organisation Committee in London has condemned the recent actions of the U.S. government in suppressing Black people.

	The committee sent a telegram to President Eisenhower last week, expressing regret over the arrest of six hundred Black students for demonstrating against racial discrimination in Georgia and South Carolina. In a press release issued this week, the committee called attention to the fact that forty-one Black people in Tennessee were also arrested for entering two public libraries.

	The committee pointed out that racial democracy is an indivisible part of democracy. The committee said: "Racial discrimination is an immoral act. A constitution that condones immoral acts is itself immoral."

	The committee pointed out that the United States has recently expressed concern about African affairs, but Americans "must first put their own house in order."

    伦敦非洲人组织致电抗议美当局迫害黑人
    新华社伦敦21日电　伦敦的非洲组织委员会谴责美国政府最近镇压黑人的行动。
    委员会上星期打电报给艾森豪威尔总统，对六百名黑人学生由于在佐治亚州和南卡罗来纳州示威反对种族歧视而遭逮捕一事表示遗憾。委员会在本星期发表的新闻公报中请大家注意：在田纳西州，还有四十一名黑人因进入两个公共图书馆而被捕。
    委员会指出，种族民主是民主不可分割的一部分。委员会说：“种族歧视是一种不道德的行为。宽恕不道德行为的宪法本身就是不道德的。”
    委员会指出，最近美国对非洲的事情表示关心，但是美国人“必须首先把自己家里的事情管好。”
