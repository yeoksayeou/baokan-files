Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 17th: The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution on the industrial and transportation fronts of Hunan Province is advancing at a high speed and with irresistible force. From the beginning of this year to the end of February, workers and staff in the province's industrial and transportation sectors have implemented 770,000 rationalization proposals, including more than 53,900 major innovations. Approximately 150,000 people across the province have been freed from manual labor and heavy physical work. The total industrial output value of the province for January and February both exceeded planned targets, with the production tasks completed in these two months accounting for 73% of the first quarter's plan.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front in various parts of Hunan Province focuses primarily on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, targeting the weak links in production that rely heavily on manual labor, and driving overall development across all sectors. At the start of the movement, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, recognizing that the transportation sector employed the most labor and that the bottleneck in transportation lay in the slow pace of port loading and unloading, decided in February to prioritize technical innovation and technical revolution in port and wharf loading and unloading. It organized 300,000 loading and unloading transportation workers throughout the province to engage in a major effort to mechanize and systematize loading and unloading at ports, stations, and warehouses. Leaders at all levels went deep into the front lines, promptly recognizing model workers and advanced experience and holding on-site meetings to promote the rapid development of the movement. From the beginning of February to March 6, in a span of just over thirty days, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading increased from the original 5% to 53.6%, and loading and unloading efficiency increased by 1.5 times. Previously, the province's loading and unloading transportation sector needed to add 50,000 workers to complete its tasks; now, not only is there no need to add personnel, but 20,000 workers can be transferred to support other production departments. After breaking through the bottleneck of port loading and unloading across the province, the Provincial Committee proposed a new main direction, namely, focusing on the technical transformation of mines, requiring the basic realization of "one-stop" mechanization of mining and transportation by the end of June. Currently, the vast number of mine workers in the province are responding to the call of the Provincial Committee and have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

This guiding ideology of attacking weak links and driving overall development is also being successfully applied in various industries and departments, yielding equally significant results. For example, workers in the machinery system have focused on the weak links of the first molding process and the final fitting and assembly processes in machinery production, vigorously promoting the mechanization of manual operations. The castings blank production of Changsha Water Pump Factory often failed to keep up with processing needs, so the factory's Party Secretary adopted a hands-on approach, leading workers to focus on the casting process. After ten days of hard work, all ten processes in the molding workshop, including molding sand treatment, feeding, and scrap iron handling, were mechanized, increasing the degree of mechanization to over 60%, thereby fundamentally reversing the passive situation where castings blanks could not be supplied in the past. Some industrial and mining enterprises with a high degree of mechanization are developing towards semi-automation and automation. From the beginning of the year to the end of February, the province has created 276 automatic production lines, 1,068 assembly lines, and 1,359 single-machine automated equipment, and there have also emerged six unmanned sections and workshops.

Although Hunan Province has taken breaking through weak links as the main direction of technical innovation and technical revolution, the correct application of the leadership methods of using points to lead the area and the large scale of the movement have meant that its impact has long exceeded a single system or department. Therefore, the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the province has swept across all departments and industries, forming a mass movement involving all the people. In Changsha and Yiyang, the bamboo ware industry, which uses manual production, has created advanced production tools for splitting bamboo, realizing mechanical operation of processes such as splitting bamboo and putting down the bamboo knives of thousands of years. From the beginning of February to the end of February, the canteens of 147 county-run factories and mines in Hengyang Prefecture manufactured more than 1,200 pieces of advanced cooking equipment such as vegetable cutting machines and dishwashing machines, basically achieving the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking equipment.

This newspaper reports that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Guangzhou is being widely carried out on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade fronts of the city. By the end of February, the city had 16 automated factories, 2 semi-automated factories, 49 automated workshops, 37 semi-automated workshops, 183 automated production lines, 348 semi-automated production lines, 951 single-machine automated devices, and 1,243 single-machine semi-automated devices. In just over a month, the proportion of manual operations in the city has decreased from the original 58% to 44%. Approximately 20,000 workers have in this period put down the heavy tools used for thousands of years, replaced them with simple machines, and significantly improved labor efficiency.

Technicians, apprentices, ordinary workers, cooks, technicians, and leading cadres in various industries have enthusiastically participated in the movement. Workers at the South Railway Station manufactured nine belt conveyors, three electric motors, and 588 other various types of indigenous machines, and established four mechanized operation lines and eight mechanized linkage lines. This has made the round-trip loading and unloading of materials from barges on the Pearl River to trains and from trains to automobiles easy and fast. The innovation projects on the financial and trade front covered a wide range, such as the catering industry's reform of cooking tools for baking cakes, cutting vegetables, and washing. Photography workers created AC electronic flash units and automatic film receiving machines. In order to reduce labor intensity, the trade and department store industries created bamboo splitting machines and cotton batting machines. The realization of these innovation projects has increased work efficiency by several times to dozens of times.

The city's industrial, commercial, financial, and banking sectors are extensively carrying out large-scale collaboration activities to jointly solve problems in raw materials, fuel, transportation, and funds. For example, due to the development of production and the further development of the technical innovation movement in the Northern District, raw materials and materials could not keep up with demand. Under the leadership of the District Committee, the district organized a "one-stop" large-scale collaboration among the 138 factories and enterprises under the five bureaus of the District Waste Products Company specializing in district-level mechanical and electrical, chemical, textile, light industry, and handicraft sectors, with all parties working together to recycle waste materials and provide mutual support. Since January of this year, 3,080 tons of recycled waste materials have been recovered, supplying 1,070 tons of raw materials and materials to various factories. The city's scientific and technological circles have dispatched more than 700 people to factories to work with workers to tackle technical bottlenecks, help various enterprises identify and promote advanced machinery, and hold classes to train technical personnel. This has vigorously promoted the development of the technical innovation movement.

    主攻薄弱环节　带动全面开花
    湖南技术革新运动声势浩大成效卓著
    广州各行各业协力革新手工操作比重迅速降低
    据新华社长沙17日电　湖南省工业、交通运输战线上的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，正以破竹之势高速度地向前发展。从今年年初到2月底止，全省工业、交通部门职工已经实现了七十七万条合理化建议，其中重大革新有五万三千九百多项。全省约有十五万多人已从手工操作和笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。全省1、2月份工业总产值都超额完成了计划，两个月完成的生产任务，占第一季度计划的73％。
    湖南省各地工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，主要以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心，主攻手工操作多的生产薄弱环节，带动各行各业全面开花。运动一开始，中共湖南省委根据交通运输部门占用劳力最多，而交通运输的薄弱环节又在于港口装卸工作跟不上的这种情况，在2月份确定以港口码头装卸搬运为技术革新和技术革命的重点，组织全省三十万装卸运输职工，大闹港口、车站、仓栈的装卸机械化和机械系统化。各级领导都深入下去，及时插红旗、树标兵，召开现场会议，交流先进经验，推动了运动迅速发展，从2月初到3月6日的三十多天中，装卸机械化和半机械化的程度就由原来的5％提高到53．6％，装卸效率提高一点五倍。原来全省装卸运输部门需要增加五万劳动力，才能完成任务，现在不但不增加人，还可以抽调两万人支援其他生产部门。在全省突破港口装卸薄弱环节以后，省委又提出了新的主攻方向，即以矿山的技术改造为重点，要求在6月底以前，基本上实现矿山开采和运输“一条龙”土机械化。目前，全省广大矿山职工正响应省委的号召，掀起了技术革新和技术革命运动。
    这种猛攻薄弱环节、带动全面的指导思想，也在各行各业各部门成功地运用着，同样收到显著的效果。如机械系统的职工，就突出地抓住机械生产第一道造型工序和最后一道钳工和装配工序的薄弱环节，大搞手工操作机械化。长沙水泵厂铸件毛坯生产经常跟不上加工的需要，工厂党委书记就采取一竿子插到底的办法，率领职工猛攻铸造关。经过十天奋战，型铸车间的型砂处理、加料、碎铁等十道工序全部实现了机械生产，机械化程度上升到60％以上，从而根本上扭转了过去铸件毛坯供应不上的被动局面。一些机械化程度较高的工矿企业，则向半自动化和自动化方向发展。全省从年初到2月底止，已经创造了二百七十六条生产自动线，一千零六十八条生产流水线，一千三百五十九台单机自动化设备，还出现了六个无人工段和车间。
    虽然湖南省把突破薄弱环节作为技术革新和技术革命的主攻方向，但是由于各级领导正确运用以点带面、有点有面的领导方法，加上运动规模声势浩大，其影响早就超过一个系统，一个部门。因此目前全省的技术革新和技术革命运动，已席卷各个部门、各个行业，形成了全民性的群众运动。长沙市和益阳等地用手工生产的竹器行业，创造了破篾等先进生产工具，使破篾等工序实现了机械操作，放下了几千年来的篾刀。衡阳专区一百四十七个县属的工厂矿山的食堂，从2月初到2月底的二十多天中，共制造各种切菜机、洗碗机等先进炊具一千二百多件，基本上实现了炊具机械化和半机械化。
    本报讯　广州市技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全市工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸等战线上广泛开展。到2月底，全市已出现了自动化工厂十六个，半自动化工厂两个；自动化车间四十九个、半自动化车间三十七个；自动化生产线一百八十三条，半自动化生产线三百四十八条；单机自动化九百五十一台，单机半自动化一千二百四十三台。一个多月来，全市的手工操作比重已由原来58％降低到44％。约有两万名工人在这个期间放下了千百年来沿用的笨重工具，换上简易机具，劳动效率显著提高。
    各行各业的技工、徒工、普通工、炊事员、技术员、领导干部都热情地参加运动。铁路局南站职工制造了板带运输机九台，电动机三台以及其他各种土机具五百八十八件，并建立了四条机械化作业线和八条机械化联动线，这样就使物资从珠江畔的驳船上到火车上，又从火车上到汽车上的往返装卸工作进行得既轻松又迅速。财贸战线的革新项目包括的范围很广，如饮食业改革了烘饼、切菜、洗涤等炊事工具。摄影业职工们自制了交流电子闪光灯和冲胶卷自动收件机等。贸易行业和百货行业为了减轻劳动强度，分别创制了开篾机和弹棉胎机。这些革新项目的实现，使工作效率提高了数倍以至数十倍。
    全市工、商、财、银各行各业正在广泛展开大协作活动，共同解决原材料、燃料、运输、资金等方面的问题。例如北区由于生产的发展和技术革新运动的进一步开展，原料、材料赶不上需要。这个区便在区委的领导下，组织了区废品公司专区属机电、化工、纺织、轻工、手工五个分局所属的一百三十八个工厂企业的“一条龙”大协作，各方一齐动手，回收废旧物资，进行互相支援。今年1月以来回收的废旧物资即达三千零八十吨，供应了各工厂原料、材料一千零七十吨。全市科学技术界抽出了七百多人下厂和工人们一道攻打技术关键，帮助各个企业鉴定和推广先进机具，并且开班讲授，培养技术人材。这都有力地促进了技术革新运动的开展。
