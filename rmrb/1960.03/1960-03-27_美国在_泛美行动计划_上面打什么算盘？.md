What is the US up to with the "Pan-American Action Plan"?
Shen Deji

When US President Eisenhower delivered a speech to the Brazilian Congress on February 24th, he stated that the United States would "endorse" Brazilian President Kubitschek's "Pan-American Action Plan," namely, the US would fund and participate in "developing Latin America's economy." He also stated that he would request an early meeting of the Committee of Nine to "accelerate the formulation of specific plans needed to implement this plan." As everyone knows, after Kubitschek proposed the "Pan-American Action Plan," the United States initially expressed verbal support for the plan, and then adopted a perfunctory and evasive attitude towards it for quite some time. Now, Eisenhower, during his visit to South American countries to promote the new American "Monroe Doctrine," has again expressed "endorsement" for this plan. This cannot help but raise the question: how could the US monopoly groups, which have always brutally plundered and exploited Latin American countries, be willing to spend money to help participate in "developing Latin America's economy"? What calculations are behind the US's "enthusiasm" for the "Pan-American Action Plan"?

If one notes the changes in the US's attitude towards this plan in the past and the development of US policy towards Latin American countries, it is not difficult to see that the US is now attempting to use the "Pan-American Action Plan" as a tool to promote "Pan-Americanism" in conjunction with its "big stick policy" towards Latin American countries; and through this plan, which has been tampered with to its advantage, to intensify its economic plunder of Latin American countries.

The "Pan-American Action Plan" was proposed by Brazilian President Kubitschek after US Vice President Nixon's visit to Latin America in 1958 triggered a strong anti-American wave. This anti-American wave reflected the deepening economic crisis faced by Latin American countries at that time due to the predatory policies of US imperialism and the strong dissatisfaction of these countries with US policy. Against this general political and economic background, Kubitschek proposed the "Pan-American Action Plan" in a letter to Eisenhower on May 28, 1958. The basic content of this plan is: politically, to rely on the United States to get rid of the "insignificant rearguard position" of Latin American countries in international affairs; economically, to rely on US "aid" and investment to stabilize and develop the Latin American economy. Shortly after Kubitschek proposed this plan, Brazilian Communist Party General Secretary Prestes pointed out to reporters from the Brazilian newspaper *Imprensa* that the only positive aspect contained in this plan was that it formally expressed the national bourgeoisie's desire to change the backward economic situation. However, he emphasized: it would be wrong for the government to want to gain some benefit by relying on the "Pan-American Plan" advocated by the Brazilian president.

In the nearly two years since Kubitschek proposed this plan, the United States has not taken any practical actions to help "develop Latin America's economy." On the contrary, the United States has attempted to exploit the illusions of the national bourgeoisie in some Latin American countries about relying on the United States, as reflected in this plan, focusing on how to use this plan to serve the US policy of controlling and plundering Latin American countries.

In this regard, it is most noteworthy that the United States has played various tricks in the past to try to politically link this plan with the "Pan-American system," which was formulated by the United States for the purpose of controlling, plundering Latin American countries, and suppressing the national democratic movement in the region, making it a tool to intensify the promotion of "Pan-Americanism." As early as the end of 1958, the French weekly *Tribune des Nations* pointed out that the reason why the United States agreed to convene the American "Committee of Twenty-One" to discuss this plan was "to restore the luster to Pan-Americanism, which had been more or less tarnished by the tomatoes thrown at Nixon." Before the American "Committee of Twenty-One" held its first meeting at the end of 1958 to discuss this plan, the United States had already tampered with it. Originally, Kubitschek, when proposing the "Pan-American Action Plan," considered that the "Organization of American States" had already been discredited, and therefore advocated implementing his plan outside the scope of this organization. However, the United States insisted that any joint action by American countries should be carried out within the scope of the "Organization of American States," and finally Kubitschek abandoned his position in this regard. As everyone knows, the "Organization of American States," which was pieced together by the United States in 1948, has been an important tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and engage in subversive activities in Latin America for more than ten years.

At the second meeting of the American "Committee of Twenty-One" held in Buenos Aires in 1959, the United States even more blatantly revealed its sinister intentions in this regard. At the end of this meeting to discuss the "Pan-American Action Plan," the United States strongly advocated adding the following sentence to the final declaration of the meeting: "The meeting places economic issues and common security issues on the same level, which shows a major achievement." However, the US's attempt to link the "Pan-American Action Plan" with the US's military and political plans in Latin America was opposed by representatives of Latin American countries attending the meeting. Representatives from Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Uruguay refused to sign the declaration, and the meeting finally had to cancel the declaration and only issued a press communiqué. But the setbacks suffered by the United States did not make it abandon its conspiracy to use the "Pan-American Action Plan" politically to serve it. Eisenhower's recent promotion of the new "Monroe Doctrine" in South America while expressing "endorsement" of the "Pan-American Action Plan" is enough to illustrate the US's intentions in this regard.

As for the economic aspect, Kubitschek's proposal was originally a plan to "seek skin from a tiger." The US's actions in Latin America have always been to seize by skill and plunder, and it is impossible to provide real assistance to "develop Latin America's economy." In August 1958, the Brazilian government requested a loan from the US government to develop Brazilian oil, but it was rejected by former US Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles' "reason" was: the United States cannot spend money on such "speculative" investments. Dulles's words typically show that the profit-seeking US monopoly groups can never use capital to help backward countries develop their economies. This is the fundamental reason why the United States has long been unwilling to participate in this plan. Later, the United States was forced by the situation to express "support" for this plan, but it also did not intend to provide Latin American countries with real assistance that would help their economic development, but attempted to tamper with the positive aspects of this plan regarding the request for economic development, in order to turn it into a plan that would actually allow the United States to intensify its plunder of Latin American resources based on unilateral preferential conditions that are beneficial to it through private investment in easily profitable sectors. The US's approach in the process of negotiations between Latin American countries and the United States on this plan clearly shows this. After Kubitschek specifically negotiated with the United States on the issue of attracting US private investment, the United States further proposed harsh conditions such as guaranteeing the free transfer of profits from US private investment, guaranteeing no confiscation of private property, and not taxing US investment. Later, the US's unreasonable position was fiercely criticized by representatives of Latin American countries at the first meeting of the American "Committee of Twenty-One," resulting in the meeting ending in discord.

At the second meeting of the American "Committee of Twenty-One," the United States, through the "Fifteen-Nation Working Group" it manipulated, once again put forward such conditions to Latin American countries: Latin American capital importing countries must "reconsider their policies, legislation, and administrative guidelines to improve investment conditions." The US's harsh demands were strongly opposed by representatives from Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay, who believed that these demands were an infringement on the sovereignty of Latin American countries.

However, the US's practice of forcing Latin American countries to agree to give the United States more favorable conditions to facilitate its private investment activities is one of the main contents of the US's policy of economic plunder of Latin American countries. Milton Eisenhower, Special Advisor to Eisenhower on Latin American Affairs, in a report submitted to Eisenhower in January 1959, in addition to proposing other strategies for aggression and plunder of Latin American countries, emphasized advocating increasing private investment in Latin American countries, and suggested inducing Latin American countries to "maintain a friendly attitude towards private competitive enterprises that will invest private capital." Rockefeller family representative in Latin America with huge investment interests, New York Governor Rockefeller also recently repeatedly advocated increasing US private investment in Latin American countries, and suggested establishing a "Pan-American Economic Alliance" controlled by US monopoly capital. While Eisenhower expressed "endorsement" for the "Pan-American Action Plan" in the Brazilian Congress, he emphasized that he "felt proud" of the huge amount of investment that the United States owns in Brazil, which extracts huge profits every year. It seems that the main conspiracy hidden behind Eisenhower's "endorsement" attitude towards this plan is to try to use this plan to open up a more favorable path for US monopoly capital to invest in Latin America.

In January of this year, the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank," which the United States had refused to participate in, was declared established. Establishing this bank is one of the main economic contents of the "Pan-American Action Plan." Latin American countries originally wanted to establish this bank in order to develop their economies by borrowing US capital through this institution. However, the United States obtained control of this bank by occupying 45% of the bank's capital. At the same time, according to the provisions of the bank's charter, this bank will closely cooperate with the US Export-Import Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development controlled by the United States to jointly invest in Latin America. The investments of these banks are always attached with harsh political and economic conditions. In this way, the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank" will only be used to serve the US's policy of intensifying control and plunder of Latin American countries.

It is worth noting that the United States still insists that these countries must first accept the harsh conditions put forward by the United States in terms of providing loans to Latin American countries. This was clearly demonstrated by US Secretary of State Herter's statement at a press conference held in Washington on March 9. In answering questions from reporters, Herter made it clear that the policy of the International Monetary Fund that when granting loans to countries like Brazil, they must first "formulate some kind of stabilization agreement or anti-inflation measures" has "not changed." As everyone knows, countries like Argentina have been forced to implement so-called "economic stabilization plans" after accepting US loans, which has allowed the United States to gain many economic privileges in this country and plunged the country's economy into increasingly difficult circumstances. In answering another question, Herter also said that the United States "will not immediately" increase the funds of the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank." He said, "The Pan-American Bank must start slowly, perhaps so slowly that people will feel disappointed." It is extremely obvious that even if the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank," which only has 1 billion US dollars in funds, lends money to Latin American countries under extremely harsh political and economic conditions, it will be far from meeting the needs of Latin American countries to develop their economies in terms of quantity.

Currently, the United States has a huge investment of 13 billion US dollars in Latin American countries. According to materials published by the United Nations, during the period of 1946-1954, US companies could obtain a profit of 3.17 US dollars for every US dollar invested in Latin America. Because these blood-sucking capital of the United States controls the economic lifeline of Latin American countries and extracts the maximum profit, coupled with the US's "cheap buying and expensive selling" policy and other plundering methods, Latin American countries are in a state of shrinking national industries and extreme economic difficulties. The "Pan-American Action Plan" originally proposed by Kubitschek is a product of the increasingly acute economic contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries. The United States' current attempt to use this plan to serve its predatory policies, and intensify the influx of its large amount of private capital into Latin American countries, will only lead to the bankruptcy of the national economies of these countries, thereby deepening the contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries and arousing even stronger opposition from the Latin American people to US imperialism.

    美国在“泛美行动计划”上面打什么算盘？
    申德诒
    美国总统艾森豪威尔2月24日在巴西国会发表演说的时候，曾经表示美国将“赞同”巴西总统库比契克提出的“泛美行动计划”，即由美国出资参加“开发拉丁美洲的经济”。他还表示将要求早日举行九国委员会会议，以便“加速制订实现这项计划所需的具体规划”。大家知道，在库比契克提出“泛美行动计划”以后，美国最初在口头上对这项计划表示支持，随后在相当一个时期中对它采取了敷衍、应付的态度。而目前，艾森豪威尔在他这次到南美国家推销美国的新的“门罗主义”的时候，却又对这项计划表示了“赞同”。这不能不使人们提出这样的问题：一向对拉丁美洲国家进行残酷的掠夺和剥削的美国垄断集团怎么会愿意拿出钱来帮助参加“开发拉丁美洲的经济”？美国在对“泛美行动计划”表示“热心”的背后究竟打着什么样的算盘呢？
    如果人们注意到美国过去一个时期对这项计划的态度的变化以及美国对拉丁美洲国家政策的发展，就不难看出：美国目前正在企图利用“泛美行动计划”，作为同它对拉丁美洲国家的“大棒政策”相辅而行的推行“泛美主义”的工具；并且通过已经被它篡改得对它有利的这项计划，对拉丁美洲国家加紧进行经济掠夺。
    “泛美行动计划”是巴西总统库比契克在美国副总统尼克松1958年到拉丁美洲访问激起强大的反美浪潮以后提出的，这次反美浪潮反映了当时拉丁美洲各国由于美帝国主义对它们的掠夺政策而遭遇的经济危机的深刻化以及这些国家对美国政策的强烈不满。在这个总的政治和经济背景下，库比契克在1958年5月28日写给艾森豪威尔的信中，提出“泛美行动计划”。这项计划的基本内容是：在政治方面依靠美国来摆脱拉丁美洲国家在国际事务中所处的“毫不显著的后卫地位”；在经济方面依靠美国的“援助”和投资以稳定和发展拉丁美洲的经济。巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯在库比契克提出这项计划后不久，就曾经对巴西“新闻报”记者指出，这一计划中包含的唯一积极方面是正式表现出了民族资产阶级关于改变落后的经济状态的要求。但是，他着重说：如果政府想依靠巴西总统所倡议的“泛美计划”来获得某种好处，那就错了。
    在库比契克提出这项计划以后的近两年中，美国并没有采取任何实际行动来帮助“开发拉丁美洲的经济”。与此相反，美国却企图利用这项计划中反映出的拉丁美洲某些国家中的民族资产阶级依赖美国的幻想，着重策划怎样利用这项计划来为美国控制和掠夺拉丁美洲国家的政策服务。
    在这方面，最值得注意的是，美国在过去一个时期中玩弄了种种手法，企图使这项计划在政治上同美国制订的目的在于控制、掠夺拉丁美洲国家和镇压这个地区的民族民主运动的“泛美制度”联系起来，使它成为加紧推行“泛美主义”的工具。法国“国际论坛”周刊早在1958年底就曾经指出，美国所以同意召开美洲“二十一国委员会”会议来讨论这项计划，其目的就“在于使被尼克松所挨的西红柿多多少少污损了的泛美主义恢复光彩”。而在1958年底举行的美洲“二十一国委员会”会议开始就这项计划进行讨论以前，美国就在这方面做了手脚。原来，库比契克在提出“泛美行动计划”时，就考虑到“美洲国家组织”已经声明狼借，因此主张在这个组织的范围以外推行他的计划。但是，美国却坚持美洲国家的任何共同行动都应该在“美洲国家组织”范围内进行，并且终于使库比契克在这方面放弃了他的主张。而大家知道，在1948年由美国一手拼凑起来的“美洲国家组织”，十多年来一直是美国用以干涉拉丁美洲国家内政和在拉丁美洲搞颠复活动的重要工具。
    在美洲“二十一国委员会”于1959年在布宜诺斯艾利斯举行的第二次会议上，美国更加露骨地表明了它在这方面的阴险图谋。在这次讨论“泛美行动计划”的会议结束的时候，美国曾经极力主张在会议的最后宣言中加上这样一句话：“会议把经济问题和共同安全问题列在同一水平上，这表明是一个重大的成就”。可是，美国企图把“泛美行动计划”同美国在拉丁美洲的军事、政治计划联系起来的阴谋遭到与会的拉丁美洲国家代表的反对。智利、墨西哥、古巴和乌拉圭等国的代表拒绝在宣言上签字，会议最后只好取消了这项宣言，而只发表一项新闻公报了事。但是美国所遭到的挫折并没有使它放弃在政治上利用“泛美行动计划”来为它服务的阴谋。艾森豪威尔最近在南美一面标榜新的“门罗主义”；一面表示“赞同”“泛美行动计划”，足以说明美国在这方面的用心。
    至于在经济方面，库比契克提出的本来就是一项“与虎谋皮”的计划。美国在拉丁美洲的行径一贯是巧取豪夺，它是不可能提供真正的援助来“开发拉丁美洲的经济”的。1958年8月，巴西政府曾经向美国政府要求贷给一笔款项来开发巴西的石油，却遭到美国前国务卿杜勒斯的拒绝。杜勒斯提出的“理由”是：美国不能花钱进行这种“投机性的”投资。杜勒斯的这句话典型地表明，唯利是图的美国垄断集团决不可能把资本用来帮助落后国家来发展经济。这就是美国长期不肯参加这项计划的根本原因。其后，美国迫于形势而不得不表示“支持”这项计划，却也丝毫没有打算向拉丁美洲国家提供真正有助于它们的经济发展的援助，而是企图篡改这项计划关于要求发展经济的积极一面，以便把它变成一项实际上使美国可以根据片面对它有利的优惠条件通过对容易获利的部门的私人投资来加紧掠夺拉丁美洲资源的计划。在拉丁美洲国家同美国就这项计划进行谈判的过程中，美国的做法清楚地表明了这一点。美国前国务卿杜勒斯在库比契克向美国提出帮助克服巴西经济困难的要求以后，曾经干脆拒绝了这些要求，而只是主张拉丁美洲国家更多地吸引美国的私人投资。及至库比契克具体同美国谈判关于吸引美国私人投资的问题时，美国却又进一步提出要保证美国私人投资的利润可以自由转移、保证不没收私人财产、不对美国投资抽税等苛刻条件。其后，美国的这种无理立场在美洲“二十一国委员会”第一次会议上遭到拉丁美洲国家代表的猛烈抨击，结果使得会议不欢而散。
    在美洲“二十一国委员会”第二次会议上，美国通过由它操纵的“十五国工作小组”再次向拉丁美洲国家提出这样的条件：拉丁美洲的资本输入国必须“重新考虑他们的政策、立法和行政方针以改善投资条件”。美国的这种苛刻要求遭到古巴、墨西哥和乌拉圭代表的强烈反对，他们认为这些要求是对拉丁美洲国家主权的侵犯。
    但是，美国迫使拉丁美洲国家同意给予美国更加优惠的条件以利于它的私人投资活动的做法，是美国对拉丁美洲国家的经济掠夺政策的主要内容之一。艾森豪威尔对拉丁美洲事务特别顾问密尔顿·艾森豪威尔于1959年1月向艾森豪威尔提出的报告中，除了提出其它方面的侵略和掠夺拉丁美洲国家的策略以外，就曾经着重鼓吹加紧向拉丁美洲国家增加私人投资，并且建议诱使拉丁美洲国家对“将要投入私人资本的私人竞争企业保持友好的态度”。在拉丁美洲拥有巨大投资利益的洛克菲勒家族的代表、美国纽约州州长洛克菲勒最近也一再鼓吹增加美国对拉丁美洲国家的私人投资，并且建议成立一个由美国垄断资本控制的“泛美经济联盟”。艾森豪威尔在巴西国会中对“泛美行动计划”表示“赞同”的同时，着重对美国在巴西拥有的每年榨取巨额利润的巨额投资表示“感到自豪”。看来，艾森豪威尔对这项计划的“赞同”态度背后隐藏着的主要图谋，就是企图利用这项计划，为美国垄断资本向拉丁美洲投资打开更加有利的道路。
    今年1月，美国曾经拒绝参加的“泛美经济开发银行”已经宣告成立。建立这家银行是“泛美行动计划”在经济方面的主要内容之一。拉丁美洲国家要求建立这家银行，本来是想通过这个机构借助美国资本来开发自己的经济。但是，美国却通过占有这家银行的45％的资本，取得了对这家银行的控制权。同时，根据银行章程的规定，这家银行将同美国进出口银行和由美国控制的国际复兴开发银行密切配合，对拉丁美洲联合进行投资。这些银行的投资是一贯附有苛刻政治和经济条件的。这样，“泛美经济开发银行”将只能被用来为美国加紧控制和掠夺拉丁美洲国家的掠夺政策服务。
    值得注意的是，美国在给予拉丁美洲国家以贷款方面仍然坚持这些国家必须事先接受美国提出的苛刻条件，美国国务卿赫脱3月9日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上的发言清楚地表明了这一点。赫脱在答复记者提出的问题时明白表示，国际货币基金组织在给予像巴西这样的国家以贷款的时候必须使它们事先“制定出某种稳定协议或反通货膨胀的措施”的政策，“没有变化”。大家知道，像阿根廷这样的国家由于在接受美国贷款以后被迫推行所谓“稳定经济计划”，而使美国在这个国家中获得很多经济特权，并且使本国经济陷入日益困难的境地。赫脱在答复另一个问题时还说，美国“不会马上”增加“泛美经济开发银行”的基金。他说，“泛美银行必须慢慢开始，可能慢得使人感到失望。”极其明显，仅仅拥有十亿美元资金的“泛美经济开发银行”即使以极为苛刻的政治、经济条件向拉丁美洲国家贷款，也远远不能在数量上满足拉丁美洲国家发展经济的要求。
    目前，美国在拉丁美洲国家有一百三十亿美元的巨额投资。据联合国公布的材料，1946—1954年期间，美国各公司对拉丁美洲每一元的投资就可以获得三元一角七分的利润。由于美国的这些吸血榨髓的资本控制了拉丁美洲国家的经济命脉和榨取了最大限度的利润，再加上美国对拉丁美洲国家的“贱买贵卖”政策和其他掠夺手段，才使得拉丁美洲国家处于民族工业萎缩、经济极端困难的境地。库比契克原先提出的“泛美行动计划”正是美国同拉丁美洲国家间这种经济矛盾日益尖锐化的产物。而美国目前转而企图利用这项计划来为它的掠夺政策服务，加紧向拉丁美洲国家倾入它的大量私人资本，到头来只会使这些国家的民族经济陷于破产的境地，从而加深美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的矛盾，激起拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义的更加强烈的反对。
