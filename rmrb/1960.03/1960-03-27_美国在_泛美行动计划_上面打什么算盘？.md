What is the US up to with the "Pan-American Action Plan"?
Shen Deji

When US President Eisenhower delivered a speech to the Brazilian Congress on February 24th, he stated that the United States would "endorse" Brazilian President Kubitschek's "Pan-American Action Plan," namely, the US would fund and participate in "developing Latin America's economy." He also stated that he would request an early meeting of the Committee of Nine to "accelerate the formulation of specific plans needed to implement this plan." As everyone knows, after Kubitschek proposed the "Pan-American Action Plan," the United States initially expressed verbal support for the plan, and then adopted a perfunctory and evasive attitude towards it for quite some time. Now, Eisenhower, during his visit to South American countries to promote the new American "Monroe Doctrine," has again expressed "endorsement" for this plan. This cannot help but raise the question: how could the US monopoly groups, which have always brutally plundered and exploited Latin American countries, be willing to spend money to help participate in "developing Latin America's economy"? What calculations are behind the US's "enthusiasm" for the "Pan-American Action Plan"?

If one notes the changes in the US's attitude towards this plan in the past and the development of US policy towards Latin American countries, it is not difficult to see that the US is now attempting to use the "Pan-American Action Plan" as a tool to promote "Pan-Americanism" in conjunction with its "big stick policy" towards Latin American countries; and through this plan, which has been tampered with to its advantage, to intensify its economic plunder of Latin American countries.

The "Pan-American Action Plan" was proposed by Brazilian President Kubitschek after US Vice President Nixon's visit to Latin America in 1958 triggered a strong anti-American wave. This anti-American wave reflected the deepening economic crisis faced by Latin American countries at that time due to the predatory policies of US imperialism and the strong dissatisfaction of these countries with US policy. Against this general political and economic background, Kubitschek proposed the "Pan-American Action Plan" in a letter to Eisenhower on May 28, 1958. The basic content of this plan is: politically, to rely on the United States to get rid of the "insignificant rearguard position" of Latin American countries in international affairs; economically, to rely on US "aid" and investment to stabilize and develop the Latin American economy. Shortly after Kubitschek proposed this plan, Brazilian Communist Party General Secretary Prestes pointed out to reporters from the Brazilian newspaper *Imprensa* that the only positive aspect contained in this plan was that it formally expressed the national bourgeoisie's desire to change the backward economic situation. However, he emphasized: it would be wrong for the government to want to gain some benefit by relying on the "Pan-American Plan" advocated by the Brazilian president.

In the nearly two years since Kubitschek proposed this plan, the United States has not taken any practical actions to help "develop Latin America's economy." On the contrary, the United States has attempted to exploit the illusions of the national bourgeoisie in some Latin American countries about relying on the United States, as reflected in this plan, focusing on how to use this plan to serve the US policy of controlling and plundering Latin American countries.

In this regard, it is most noteworthy that the United States has played various tricks in the past to try to politically link this plan with the "Pan-American system," which was formulated by the United States for the purpose of controlling, plundering Latin American countries, and suppressing the national democratic movement in the region, making it a tool to intensify the promotion of "Pan-Americanism." As early as the end of 1958, the French weekly *Tribune des Nations* pointed out that the reason why the United States agreed to convene the American "Committee of Twenty-One" to discuss this plan was "to restore the luster to Pan-Americanism, which had been more or less tarnished by the tomatoes thrown at Nixon." Before the American "Committee of Twenty-One" held its first meeting at the end of 1958 to discuss this plan, the United States had already tampered with it. Originally, Kubitschek, when proposing the "Pan-American Action Plan," considered that the "Organization of American States" had already been discredited, and therefore advocated implementing his plan outside the scope of this organization. However, the United States insisted that any joint action by American countries should be carried out within the scope of the "Organization of American States," and finally Kubitschek abandoned his position in this regard. As everyone knows, the "Organization of American States," which was pieced together by the United States in 1948, has been an important tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and engage in subversive activities in Latin America for more than ten years.

At the second meeting of the American "Committee of Twenty-One" held in Buenos Aires in 1959, the United States even more blatantly revealed its sinister intentions in this regard. At the end of this meeting to discuss the "Pan-American Action Plan," the United States strongly advocated adding the following sentence to the final declaration of the meeting: "The meeting places economic issues and common security issues on the same level, which shows a major achievement." However, the US's attempt to link the "Pan-American Action Plan" with the US's military and political plans in Latin America was opposed by representatives of Latin American countries attending the meeting. Representatives from Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Uruguay refused to sign the declaration, and the meeting finally had to cancel the declaration and only issued a press communiqu√©. But the setbacks suffered by the United States did not make it abandon its conspiracy to use the "Pan-American Action Plan" politically to serve it. Eisenhower's recent promotion of the new "Monroe Doctrine" in South America while expressing "endorsement" of the "Pan-American Action Plan" is enough to illustrate the US's intentions in this regard.

As for the economic aspect, Kubitschek's proposal was originally a plan to "seek skin from a tiger." The US's actions in Latin America have always been to seize by skill and plunder, and it is impossible to provide real assistance to "develop Latin America's economy." In August 1958, the Brazilian government requested a loan from the US government to develop Brazilian oil, but it was rejected by former US Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles' "reason" was: the United States cannot spend money on such "speculative" investments. Dulles's words typically show that the profit-seeking US monopoly groups can never use capital to help backward countries develop their economies. This is the fundamental reason why the United States has long been unwilling to participate in this plan. Later, the United States was forced by the situation to express "support" for this plan, but it also did not intend to provide Latin American countries with real assistance that would help their economic development, but attempted to tamper with the positive aspects of this plan regarding the request for economic development, in order to turn it into a plan that would actually allow the United States to intensify its plunder of Latin American resources based on unilateral preferential conditions that are beneficial to it through private investment in easily profitable sectors. The US's approach in the process of negotiations between Latin American countries and the United States on this plan clearly shows this. After Kubitschek specifically negotiated with the United States on the issue of attracting US private investment, the United States further proposed harsh conditions such as guaranteeing the free transfer of profits from US private investment, guaranteeing no confiscation of private property, and not taxing US investment. Later, the US's unreasonable position was fiercely criticized by representatives of Latin American countries at the first meeting of the American "Committee of Twenty-One," resulting in the meeting ending in discord.

At the second meeting of the American "Committee of Twenty-One," the United States, through the "Fifteen-Nation Working Group" it manipulated, once again put forward such conditions to Latin American countries: Latin American capital importing countries must "reconsider their policies, legislation, and administrative guidelines to improve investment conditions." The US's harsh demands were strongly opposed by representatives from Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay, who believed that these demands were an infringement on the sovereignty of Latin American countries.

However, the US's practice of forcing Latin American countries to agree to give the United States more favorable conditions to facilitate its private investment activities is one of the main contents of the US's policy of economic plunder of Latin American countries. Milton Eisenhower, Special Advisor to Eisenhower on Latin American Affairs, in a report submitted to Eisenhower in January 1959, in addition to proposing other strategies for aggression and plunder of Latin American countries, emphasized advocating increasing private investment in Latin American countries, and suggested inducing Latin American countries to "maintain a friendly attitude towards private competitive enterprises that will invest private capital." Rockefeller family representative in Latin America with huge investment interests, New York Governor Rockefeller also recently repeatedly advocated increasing US private investment in Latin American countries, and suggested establishing a "Pan-American Economic Alliance" controlled by US monopoly capital. While Eisenhower expressed "endorsement" for the "Pan-American Action Plan" in the Brazilian Congress, he emphasized that he "felt proud" of the huge amount of investment that the United States owns in Brazil, which extracts huge profits every year. It seems that the main conspiracy hidden behind Eisenhower's "endorsement" attitude towards this plan is to try to use this plan to open up a more favorable path for US monopoly capital to invest in Latin America.

In January of this year, the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank," which the United States had refused to participate in, was declared established. Establishing this bank is one of the main economic contents of the "Pan-American Action Plan." Latin American countries originally wanted to establish this bank in order to develop their economies by borrowing US capital through this institution. However, the United States obtained control of this bank by occupying 45% of the bank's capital. At the same time, according to the provisions of the bank's charter, this bank will closely cooperate with the US Export-Import Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development controlled by the United States to jointly invest in Latin America. The investments of these banks are always attached with harsh political and economic conditions. In this way, the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank" will only be used to serve the US's policy of intensifying control and plunder of Latin American countries.

It is worth noting that the United States still insists that these countries must first accept the harsh conditions put forward by the United States in terms of providing loans to Latin American countries. This was clearly demonstrated by US Secretary of State Herter's statement at a press conference held in Washington on March 9. In answering questions from reporters, Herter made it clear that the policy of the International Monetary Fund that when granting loans to countries like Brazil, they must first "formulate some kind of stabilization agreement or anti-inflation measures" has "not changed." As everyone knows, countries like Argentina have been forced to implement so-called "economic stabilization plans" after accepting US loans, which has allowed the United States to gain many economic privileges in this country and plunged the country's economy into increasingly difficult circumstances. In answering another question, Herter also said that the United States "will not immediately" increase the funds of the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank." He said, "The Pan-American Bank must start slowly, perhaps so slowly that people will feel disappointed." It is extremely obvious that even if the "Pan-American Economic Development Bank," which only has 1 billion US dollars in funds, lends money to Latin American countries under extremely harsh political and economic conditions, it will be far from meeting the needs of Latin American countries to develop their economies in terms of quantity.

Currently, the United States has a huge investment of 13 billion US dollars in Latin American countries. According to materials published by the United Nations, during the period of 1946-1954, US companies could obtain a profit of 3.17 US dollars for every US dollar invested in Latin America. Because these blood-sucking capital of the United States controls the economic lifeline of Latin American countries and extracts the maximum profit, coupled with the US's "cheap buying and expensive selling" policy and other plundering methods, Latin American countries are in a state of shrinking national industries and extreme economic difficulties. The "Pan-American Action Plan" originally proposed by Kubitschek is a product of the increasingly acute economic contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries. The United States' current attempt to use this plan to serve its predatory policies, and intensify the influx of its large amount of private capital into Latin American countries, will only lead to the bankruptcy of the national economies of these countries, thereby deepening the contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries and arousing even stronger opposition from the Latin American people to US imperialism.
