    The Invincible Power
    Feng Luo, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory
    The Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory is the first modern large-scale viscose joint enterprise in China. The complete set of equipment in the factory is manufactured according to the latest designs, and the degree of automation and continuity of the production process is relatively high. Building such a modern and technically complex enterprise was entirely new to us.
    The factory's original construction plan stipulated that the first phase of the project would be completed in three years, and that the first phase would have to be fully constructed and installed before trial production could begin. Could we speed up the construction and strive to put it into production ahead of schedule? The Party Committee carefully analyzed the conditions of all aspects of the factory and believed that it was possible to adopt the policy of simultaneous construction and production, with some equipment put into production ahead of schedule, driving the acceleration of all civil engineering and installation work, and putting it into production ahead of schedule. However, many difficulties remained. For example, some projects had to be constructed and installed in advance, some equipment was being manufactured abroad, and some auxiliary workshops could not keep up for a while, and so on.
    Faced with these difficulties, we resolutely implemented the general line of socialist construction of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, adhered to putting politics in command, and launched a vigorous mass movement. With the Party branch of the workshop as the center, we strengthened the leadership of the Party, and cadres went deep into construction sites and workshops to study the weak links in production together with workers and technicians, so as to discover problems in time and organize forces to solve them in time. At the same time, a "six-comparison red flag" competition to compare with, learn from, and catch up with the advanced was launched throughout the factory, setting off a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution to race against time for progress and efficiency. In the mass movement, many technical and equipment difficulties were overcome one by one. The development of the matter was in accordance with the Party Committee's scheduled plan. The first system of the first phase of the project was put into production before "July 1" last year, one year ahead of schedule. The second system was put into production at the end of last year, and the third and fourth systems have basically installed all the equipment. As a result of partial early production, the factory's production process has now become normal and stable, which has made technical preparations for the official full production before "May 1" this year.
    The factory construction and production work over the past two years have made us deeply realize the infinite power of the Party's putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement. The result of putting politics in command is that all the factory's employees have established the proletarian ambition and the firm belief in overcoming all difficulties, so that they dare to do things that predecessors did not dare to do. For example, in order to put into production ahead of schedule, carbon disulfide must be produced in advance. However, according to the original construction plan, the carbon disulfide workshop was to be constructed at a later time, and the equipment was ordered from abroad and could not be obtained for a while. Under this circumstance, the employees immediately started the experimental work of producing carbon disulfide by indigenous methods. Carbon disulfide is highly toxic and easily explosive. In the eyes of ordinary people, it cannot be produced except with foreign equipment. However, the employees broke this conservative idea. They believed that the earliest production of carbon disulfide must have started with indigenous methods. Since the predecessors had already produced it, we must be able to produce it. At the same time, the predecessors did not understand the hazards of carbon disulfide as clearly as we do now in the experimental process. We can better prevent it, and the initiative is in the hands of people. As a result, we not only safely produced carbon disulfide and met the needs of production, but also, in the process of continuous production and continuous improvement, enabled the employees of the carbon disulfide workshop to better understand the problems in the production of carbon disulfide, learn from the experience that is not easy to find in the production of carbon disulfide by foreign methods, and create conditions for better production by foreign methods.
    Putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement not only mobilized the revolutionary drive of the masses, but also concentrated the infinite wisdom of the masses, thus giving full play to people's initiative in understanding and mastering the use of objective laws. For example, when we tested the effectiveness of the spinning machines, the output broke through the original design capacity. The workers in the workshop thought: Since the laboratory can spin silk beyond the design capacity, it shows that the machine itself has a higher capacity than the prescribed design capacity. Therefore, while accelerating the speed of the car, they vigorously improved the operating methods, so that the average output of the spinning machines that have been put into production in the factory exceeded the design capacity by the end of last year.
    The high-speed construction process and the high-speed commissioning of production have made us clearly see that once the masses are mobilized and the subjective initiative of the people is fully exerted, it will be the most powerful force. Technology and equipment, all these are necessary material conditions, but it is people who master technology and equipment and make them play a huge role. If you think that the technology is complex and you have no experience, and you obediently listen to the dictates of technology, equipment, etc., there is no high speed at all. Marx said: "The most powerful productive force is the revolutionary class itself." This clearly points out the great role of the revolutionary class in transforming the objective world. Any technology, machinery, and equipment are produced to meet the needs of mankind. Therefore, it is not immutable in the face of people. As long as people need it and strive to master its regularity, they can find ways to improve and enhance it.
    The Party's policy of putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement is invincible. The reason why this is the case is that it combines the invincible guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism with the soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the masses. This is an invincible force.

    无往不胜的力量
    中共保定化学纤维联合厂委员会书记　冯洛
    保定化学纤维联合厂是目前国内第一个现代化的大型粘胶联合企业。工厂的全套设备都是按照最新设计制造的，生产过程的自动化、连续化程度都比较高。建设这样一个现代化的、技术复杂的企业，对我们说来是全然陌生的。
    工厂原来的建设计划规定第一期工程三年建成，第一期工程要全部建设安装完毕才能投入试生产。能不能加快建设速度，争取提前投入生产呢？党委会仔细地分析了全厂各方面条件，认为采取边建设、边生产的方针，以部分设备提前投入生产，带动全部土建、安装工程加速进行，提前投入生产是可能的。但是，困难仍然很多。如有的工程必须提前施工安装，有的设备正在国外制造，有的辅助车间一时还跟不上来等等。
    面对着这些困难，我们坚决贯彻了多快好省的社会主义建设总路线，坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，以车间党支部为中心，加强党的领导，干部深入工地、车间，和工人、技术人员一起研究生产中的各个薄弱环节，做到及时发现问题，及时组织力量加以解决；同时，又在全厂展开比先进、学先进、赶先进的六比红旗竞赛，掀起与时间争进度、争工效的技术革新与技术革命的群众运动。在群众运动中，许多技术、设备难关都一一突破了。事情的发展，正是按照党委的预定计划，提前一年，在去年“七一”前使第一期工程的第一系统投入了生产。去年年底第二系统投入生产，第三、四系统基本上安装好了全部设备。由于部分提前投入生产的结果，现在全厂生产工艺流程已经做到正常、稳定，为今年“五一”前正式全部投入生产作好了技术准备。
    两年来的建厂和生产工作，使我们深深体会到党的政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的无限威力。政治挂帅的结果，使全厂职工都树立起了无产阶级的雄心大志和战胜一切困难的必胜信念，这样，也就敢于做前人不敢做的事。比如，为了提前投入生产，必须提前生产二硫化碳。但是，按原来的施工计划，二硫化碳车间是在后一些时间施工的，而且设备是国外订货，一时不能到手。在这种情况下，职工们立即开始了土法生产二硫化碳的试验工作。二硫化碳毒性强，易爆炸，在一般人看来是除了洋法设备不能生产的。但是职工们打破了这种保守的观念，他们认为最早的二硫化碳生产肯定是土法搞起的，既然前人已经生产过，我们就一定能生产。同时，前人在试验过程中对二硫化碳的危害性不如我们现在了解得清楚，我们就能更好地防范，主动权是掌握在人手里的。结果，我们不但安全地生产出了二硫化碳，满足了生产的需要，而且在不断生产不断改进的过程中，使二硫化碳车间的职工更好地摸清了生产二硫化碳中的问题，学到了用洋法生产不易发现的经验，为更好地用洋法生产创造了条件。
    政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，不但调动了群众的革命干劲，也把群众的无限智慧集中起来了，这样就充分地发挥人们认识并掌握利用客观规律的能动性。比如我们在试验纺丝车的效能的时候，产量突破了原来的设计能力。车间的工人想：既然实验室里能超过设计能力纺丝，就说明机器本身的能力比规定的设计能力高。于是他们在加快车速的同时，大力改进操作方法，使全厂已经投入生产的纺丝机，平均产量在去年底就超过了设计能力。
    高速度地建设进程和高速度地投入生产的情景，使我们清楚地看到：一旦群众发动起来，人的主观能动作用得到充分发挥，将是一股最强大的力量。技术、设备，这一切都是必要的物质条件，但是掌握技术、设备，使之发生巨大作用的却是人。如果以为技术复杂，没有经验，就俯首帖耳地去听从技术、设备等等的摆布，就根本没有高速度。马克思说：“最强大的一种生产力是革命的阶级本身”，这清楚地指出了革命的阶级在改造客观世界中的巨大作用。任何技术、机器设备都是适应人类的需要而产生的，因此它在人们的面前并非一成不变的，只要人们需要，努力去掌握它的规律性，就能找出改进、提高它的道路。
    党的政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的方针是无往不胜的。其所以如此，就是因为它把马克思列宁主义的无往不胜的指导思想与群众的冲天干劲和无穷智慧结合起来，这就是一支无往不胜的力量。
