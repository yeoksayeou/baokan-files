    Determined to Be a Worker Mastering Marxism-Leninism
    Zhang Baoju, Worker at Harbin Clothing Factory

    In the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have gradually felt that if the working class wants to thoroughly liberate itself, eliminate classes, complete the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and realize the great communist mission, it is absolutely impossible without the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Actual struggles have made me feel the urgent need to study Marxism-Leninism further. In May 1958, I began the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism. In the past year or so, I have studied "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and a total of twenty-one philosophical works by Lenin and Stalin. In addition, I also studied some other philosophical books and magazines. During the learning process, thanks to the help of the Party and comrades, I overcame various difficulties and achieved many successes.

    My learning process was not smooth sailing. The first obstacle I encountered was ideological resistance. I thought the theory was profound and unattainable. In the past, it was all studied by intellectuals and professors. I am an ordinary worker who has only attended school for two years. Can I learn it? I felt a little afraid when I picked up the book. Under the encouragement of the Party's call to liberate thought and dare to think and act, and seeing the news in the newspapers about workers in Shanghai and Tianjin studying theory, I thought of a Chinese proverb: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." Would I be frightened by difficulties and not learn? No. Why can't I learn what others can learn! As long as I have the determination, I will definitely learn it and learn it well. When I started reading, I encountered a lot of nouns, such as contradiction and matter, that I couldn't understand and couldn't get into. After reading only two paragraphs, my head was dizzy and I wanted to sleep. What should I do? My approach was to write down the nouns and paragraphs I didn't understand and ask others for advice, discuss them with comrades who had a higher level, not to memorize the nouns by rote, but to focus on understanding the general meaning. Doing this, I slowly understood, but couldn't remember, so I combined the theoretical viewpoints I learned with the problems in production. This way of learning not only gave me a deep understanding of the principles, but also solved the problems in my actual work, so my interest in learning became stronger and stronger. Now self-study has become a habit. If I don't study for a day, it feels like there are many things I haven't done. Then there is the question of time. Production is busy during the day, and there are meetings in the evening. How can I find time to study? The rapid development of socialist construction means that production cannot be stopped for a moment, and meetings must be attended, but I must not give up learning because of these difficulties. I must fight for time and squeeze out time to study. I used the time from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day to persist in studying.

    Through two years of study, I have further strengthened my proletarian stand, established a materialist viewpoint, improved my ability to analyze things, gradually been able to look at problems from a dialectical point of view, improved my work style, and promoted my work.

    The purpose of our studying Marxist-Leninist theory is to transform the world, use the theory we have learned to guide our thinking, transform our thinking; use the theory we have learned to guide our work, and improve our work. In this way, our study of theory must be combined with the transformation of our thinking, with production practice, and with class struggle.

    How can we combine studying theory with transforming our thinking? This is what I did in the learning process: I used the theoretical viewpoints I learned to compare my own thoughts and examine my own thoughts. In the past, I thought that I had been participating in the revolution for decades, but I had made very slow progress because the leaders did not pay enough attention to me and did not help me, so I developed a complaining mood. I rarely thought about my own shortcomings, so I could not actively seek the help of comrades, and my work was not proactive and positive enough. After studying, I established the viewpoint of the connection and development of things, and realized that the internal cause plays a decisive role in the development of things. I linked this to examining the reasons for my slow progress, which was mainly due to insufficient subjective effort. Therefore, I paid attention to constantly obtaining the help of leaders and comrades, worked hard to study, and constantly overcame my shortcomings, so my progress was faster than in the past. After learning the principle of mutual restriction, I used this principle to check my own thoughts and found that my thoughts were contrary to this principle. For example, when I was the group leader in the second workshop, our group had three seventh-grade workers, while other groups didn't have any. Our group's production was very smooth, while other groups' production was very chaotic, and the output was very low. In order to take care of the overall work, the leaders transferred our group's seventh-grade workers to other groups. At that time, I was very dissatisfied, and my thoughts were not resolved for a long time. After I learned the principle of the universal connection and mutual restriction of things, I used this principle to check my own thoughts and realized that this was because I didn't understand how to look at the connection of things comprehensively, but used an isolated and one-sided viewpoint to look at the problem. Therefore, I only cared about my own group and didn't care about other groups, which was departmentalism. I realized that our various groups are also interconnected and mutually restricted. Although our group completed the task, if other groups could not complete the task on time, then the entire workshop would not be able to complete the task. Through this examination, I discovered and recognized my wrong thoughts, and constantly paid attention to overcoming them and changing them, so I gradually established a comprehensive and connected viewpoint of looking at problems. This transformed my thinking and improved my understanding; at the same time, it also deepened my understanding of the theory I had learned.

    Combining the study of theory with practical work means using the theory we have learned to guide our work and solve problems in our work. This is an important aspect of our learning for application. I deeply feel that to understand anything, we cannot stay at one point, we must rise from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge in order to understand the essence and the overall situation of things. Otherwise, in our work, we will be deceived by the temporary superficial phenomena, fail to grasp the essence, and make empiricist mistakes. For example, in the past, the workshop often experienced shutdowns. I only saw the superficial phenomenon that the previous process was busy and the next process had no work to do. I did not see that this was due to the improvement of a certain link in the production method or tools, which caused a temporary imbalance in production. I did not actively try to improve it, but instead complained that some people were not active and waited passively. After learning the viewpoint of looking at problems comprehensively, and combining it with my work, I realized the cause of the problem, and the problem was solved correctly. For example, in our production, we often encounter such a situation: whenever the leaders call for improving product quality, there is often a phenomenon of reducing quantity; and when we emphasize improving productivity, there is often an increase in the rate of defective products. In the past, I never tried to solve this problem very well. When I learned the law of mutual transformation of quality and quantity, and understood the relationship between quality and unity, I used it to guide my work. I realized that the leadership's emphasis on high quality is to require us to achieve high quality on the premise of high output. If the output is very low, even if the quality is high, it will not meet the needs of the people. Emphasizing high output also requires us to achieve high output on the basis of high quality, because no matter how high the output is, if the product quality is not up to standard and there are always defective products, then this high output will lose its meaning. Because I understood the relationship between quality and quantity, and unified quality and quantity, I was able to work hard to overcome difficulties and ensure both high quality and high output, and was continuously rated as a production red banner bearer. On the other hand, through the combination of theory and practical work, I more deeply understood the principle of quality unity. Through this process of practice - understanding - re-practice - re-understanding, my theoretical level has also been continuously improved.

    Combining the study of theory with class struggle means using the theory we have learned to arm our minds, stand firm on the class stand, and fight against all kinds of thoughts and behaviors that harm the Party and the interests of the people. For example, during a period last year, some people attacked the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. This was because they closed their eyes and did not look at reality, denied the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and exaggerated some individual and local shortcomings into the general. This was very absurd and extremely wrong. Based on the theory I had learned, I analyzed their fallacies by raising them to the level of theory, and realized that this was because they replaced the great socialist objective reality with the subjective wishes of the bourgeoisie, and it was entirely a product of subjective idealism and empiricism. Based on my understanding, I actively publicized the greatness and correctness of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and refuted various absurd remarks. In this way, in the struggle to defend socialism, I did more to fulfill my responsibilities. And in this struggle, I also greatly improved my ideological consciousness and theoretical level.

    This is my understanding of the "three combinations" that must be implemented in the study of theory.

    In addition, writing study心得 (xīndé - reflections, notes on what you have learned), and writing articles are also important aspects of learning for application and consolidating and improving learning outcomes. In the past two years, in addition to insisting on writing study心得, I have also written more than 20 articles and lecture notes. Five of them have been published in newspapers and magazines. This not only improved my level of understanding, but also improved my writing ability.

    It is the duty of a Communist Party member not only to study Marxism-Leninism, but also to actively promote Marxism-Leninism to the masses. In the past two years, I have given lectures to factory and outside workers, street residents, farmers, industrialists and businessmen, and Party school students many times. And I usually promote to everyone what I have learned in theory. This not only urged myself to study and deepened my understanding of the study, but also exercised and improved my ability to publicize Marxism-Leninism, and better fulfilled the duty of a Communist Party member.

    The reason why I have achieved these results is entirely due to the cultivation and education of the Party and the help of my comrades. This is only the beginning of my study. This little achievement is only a "drop in the ocean" compared with the requirements of the socialist cause. I am determined to continue to work hard under the leadership of the Party, without arrogance or impatience.

    This year, I plan to study Chairman Mao's economic works, continue to practice writing articles, and actively do a good job in learning guidance and lecturing in our factory. I will complete the basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism within three years, and make myself a worker who masters Marxist-Leninist theory.

    决心做个掌握马克思列宁主义的劳动者
    哈尔滨服装厂工人  张宝驹
    几年来，在党的培养教育下，我逐渐地感到工人阶级要彻底解放自己，消灭阶级，完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设，实现共产主义伟大使命，不以马克思列宁主义为指导，是绝对不行的。实际斗争使自己进一步感到迫切需要学习马克思列宁主义。在1958年的5月，我开始了马克思列宁主义的理论学习。一年多来，学习了“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和列宁、斯大林的哲学著作共二十一篇。此外，还学习了一些其他哲学书籍和杂志。在学习过程中，由于党和同志们的帮助，克服了各种困难，取得了不少成绩。
    我的学习过程并不是一帆风顺的。首先遇到的是思想阻力，认为理论深奥，高不可攀，过去都是知识分子、教授学的，我是一个普通工人，才念过两年书，能学吗？拿起书来有些惧怕。在党提出解放思想，敢想敢干口号的鼓舞下，又看到报纸上刊登出上海、天津工人学理论的消息，想起了中国的一句谚语：“天下无难事，就怕有心人”，难道我会被困难吓住而不学吗？不。别人能学的我为什么不能学呢！只要有决心就一定能学会、学好。开始读书时，又遇到一大堆名词，什么矛盾啦，物质啦，看不懂，钻不进去。拿起书来读不上两段就头昏脑胀想睡觉。怎么办呢？我采取的办法是把不懂的名词、段落记下来向别人请教，和水平高的同志讨论，不去死扣名词，着重了解大意，这样做慢慢懂得了，但记不住，我就把学到的理论观点和生产中的问题结合起来学，这样学不仅对原理了解得深刻，而且解决了实际工作中的问题，从而学习兴趣越来越浓。现在自学已成习惯，一天不学就好像有很多事没作似的。再就是时间问题，白天生产忙，晚间要开会，怎样抽时间学呢？社会主义建设飞快的发展，生产一刻也不能停止，会议必须参加，但决不能因这点困难放下不学，要争时间，挤时间来学，我利用每天晚九点至十点的时间坚持学下来。
    经过两年来的学习，我进一步坚定了无产阶级立场，树立了唯物主义观点，提高了分析事物的能力，逐渐地能够运用辩证法的观点看问题，改进了作风，推动了工作。
    我们学习马克思列宁主义理论的目的，就是要改造世界，用学到的理论指导思想，改造思想；用学到的理论指导工作，改进工作。这样，我们学习理论就必须和改造思想相结合，和生产实际相结合，和阶级斗争相结合。
    怎样使学习理论和改造思想相结合呢？我在学习过程中是这样做的，就是用学到的理论观点来对照自己的思想和检查自己的思想。我过去认为，参加革命几十年，进步很慢，原因是领导对我不重用，不帮助，因而产生了埋怨情绪。很少想到自己有什么缺点，所以不能主动的争取同志们的帮助，工作也表现得不够主动、积极。经过学习，树立了事物联系和发展的观点，了解到事物发展起决定作用的是内因，联系检查了自己进步慢的原因，主要是自己主观努力不够。从而注意了经常取得领导和同志们的帮助，努力学习，不断克服缺点，进步就比过去快。我在学了互相制约的原理之后，用这一道理对照着检查了自己的思想，发现了自己的思想有和这一原理相违背的地方。比如我在二车间作小组长的时候，我们小组有三个七级工，别的小组却一个也没有。我们小组的生产很顺当，别的小组生产很乱，产量很低。领导为了照顾全面工作，就抽调我们组的七级工到外组去。当时自己是很不满意的，思想上很长时间没解决问题。当我学了事物的普遍联系和互相制约的原理之后，运用这一原理，对自己思想进行了检查，认识到这是不懂得全面地看事物的联系，而是用孤立片面的观点看问题，因而才只顾自己小组，不顾别的小组，这是本位主义思想。认识到我们各个小组之间也是互相联系，互相制约着的，虽然我们小组完成了任务，而其他小组不能按时完成任务，那么全车间也就不能完成任务。通过这一检查，我发现和认识了自己的错误思想，并时刻注意克服它，改掉它，也就逐渐地树立了全面地联系的看问题的观点。这就改造了我的思想，提高了我的认识；同时，也加深了我对所学到的理论的认识。
    学习理论和实际工作相结合，就是用学到的理论来指导自己的工作，解决工作中的问题，这是我们学以致用的重要方面。我深深地体会到，认识任何事物都不能停留在一点上，必须从感性认识上升到理性认识，才能明了事物的本质和全局，否则工作中会被一时的表面现象所迷惑，抓不住本质，就会犯经验主义的错误。如过去车间常常出现停工现象，我只看到上工序忙，下工序无活干的表面现象，没有看到这是由于某一个环节生产方法或工具有了改进，而出现生产上暂时不平衡的本质，自己没有主动设法改进，反而埋怨有的人不积极，而消极等待。学习了全面看问题的观点以后，把它和工作结合起来，才认识到问题产生的原因，使问题得到了正确的解决。再如我们在生产中，常常出现这样的情况，就是每当领导上一号召提高产品质量，就常常要出现减低数量的现象；而一强调提高生产率的时候，又会出现次品率增多的现象。过去自己总没去很好地解决这一问题。当我学了质和量互变的规律，认识了质量的统一关系之后，用它来指导工作，认识了领导上强调优质，是要我们在高产的前提下优质。如果产量很低，即或质量再高也不会满足人民的需要。强调高产，也是要我们在优质的基础上高产，因为产量再高，如果产品质量不合格，总出次品，那么这种高产也就失去了意义。由于我认识了质和量的关系，把质和量统一起来，因而我就能努力克服困难，保证了既优质又高产，连续被评为生产红旗手。另一方面，通过理论和实际工作的结合，我更深刻地理解了质量统一的原理，通过这种实践——认识——再实践——再认识的过程，我的理论水平也获得了不断的提高。
    学习理论和阶级斗争相结合，就是用学到的理论，把自己的头脑武装起来，站稳阶级立场，同各种损害党损害人民利益的思想和行为进行斗争。比如去年一个时期有些人攻击党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社，这是他们闭眼不看现实，否定大跃进的伟大成绩，把某些个别的局部的缺点夸大成一般，这是非常荒谬的，是极端错误的。我根据自己所学到的理论，把他们的谬论提高到理论上来分析，认识到这是他们以资产阶级的主观愿望来代替伟大的社会主义的客观现实，完全是主观唯心主义的经验主义的产物。我根据自己的认识，积极地宣传了总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大和正确，批驳了种种荒谬言论。这样，我在保卫社会主义的斗争中，更多地尽到了自己的责任。并且在这场斗争中，也大大地提高了自己的思想觉悟和理论水平。
    这就是我对学习理论必须实行“三结合”的体会。
    此外，写学习心得，写文章，也是学以致用，巩固和提高学习成果的一个重要方面。两年来我除了坚持写学习心得外，还写了文章和讲稿二十余篇。在报刊杂志上发表了五篇。这不仅提高了我的认识水平，而且也锻炼了我的写作能力。
    共产党员的义务不仅要学习马克思列宁主义，而且还要积极向广大群众宣传马克思列宁主义。两年来，我向厂内外职工、街道居民、农民、工商业者、党校学员讲课多次。而且平时学到一点理论，就向大家进行宣传。这样作既督促了自己学习和加深了对学习的理解，也锻炼和提高了宣传马克思列宁主义的能力，更好地尽到一个共产党员的义务。
    我所以取得这些成绩，完全是党的培养教育和同志们帮助的结果。这仅仅是我学习的开始，这一点成绩和社会主义事业的要求相比只不过是“沧海一粟”，我决心在党的领导下，不骄不躁，继续努力。
    今年我计划学习毛主席的经济著作，继续练习写文章，积极作好本厂的学习辅导和讲课工作。在三年内学完马克思列宁主义基本理论知识，使自己成为一个掌握马克思列宁主义理论的劳动者。
