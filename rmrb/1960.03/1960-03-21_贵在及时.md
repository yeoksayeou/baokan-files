Timeliness is Key

    Every leader has personally experienced the importance of summarizing work.

    The purpose of summarizing experience is not an end in itself, but to further guide work. Since it is to guide work, there will be a question of effect. For example, whether the effect is good, whether the role is significant, whether the problem is solved, and so on. And the effect depends not only on the quality of the experience itself, but also on whether the summary, promotion, and application are timely. Many tasks are done excellently, and the experience is very successful, but because it is not summarized in time, or the promotion and application are not timely, the effect of these experiences is greatly reduced.

    Timely summary of experience, timely promotion, and timely application are leadership methods that emphasize timeliness. It is especially important to master this leadership method during the unprecedented upsurge of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. As a result of the masses' great efforts in technical innovation, industrial and mining enterprises have seen a new situation of high-speed production development. Today's manual operation may become mechanized overnight, and in a few days, it may develop into automation. In the face of such a situation, can leadership methods that do not emphasize timeliness work? With high-speed production, leadership must be highly efficient, otherwise it will not be able to keep up. If the leadership cannot keep up, it will certainly not be able to walk in front of the movement and actively promote production.

    The Guiyang Railway Bureau and the Yicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shanxi Province timely summarized the experience of the technical innovation movement, which is an important reason for the rapid progress of the movement there.

    贵在及时
    总结工作的重要性，每个领导人都有过切身的体会。
    总结经验的本身并不是目的，目的是在进一步指导工作。既然是指导工作，就会存在一个效果问题。举如效果好不好，作用大不大，解决不解决问题等等。而效果不仅决定于经验本身的质量高低，而且还决定于总结、推广、运用得及时不及时。有许多工作做得很出色，经验很成功，但是由于没有及时总结，或推广运用不及时，结果使得这些经验的效果大大减色。
    及时总结经验、及时推广、及时运用，这是一种讲究时效的领导方法，特别是在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动空前高涨的时期，掌握这种领导方法尤为重要。广大群众大闹技术革新的结果，工矿企业出现了生产高速度发展的新局面，今天的手工操作，一夜之间也许就变成了机械化，不几天，可能又发展成为自动化。在这样的形势面前，领导方法不讲究时效能行吗？生产高速度，领导必须高效率，否则就跟不上。领导跟不上，当然就无法走在运动的前面，无法积极地推动生产前进。
    贵阳铁路局、中共山西翼城县委及时总结技术革新运动的经验，这是他们那里的运动进展迅速的一个重要原因。
