Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: The communist spirit of learning from the advanced, helping the backward, supporting each other, and seeking progress together is being continuously promoted among the working people on the Soviet industrial production front. The movement of advanced workers helping backward units, first initiated by Communist Party member Gaganova last year, has gradually developed in Soviet industrial departments from individual advanced producers helping one backward unit to collectives helping and supporting each other. Many advanced collectives in industrial enterprises have successively established connections with other collectives. Not long ago, all the employees of the Kulanovno Fine Wool Factory in the Moscow region voluntarily helped the neighboring Troitsk Fine Wool Factory to improve all its technical and economic indicators to the level of advanced enterprises. Since the establishment of the connection between the two factories, the production situation of the Troitsk Fine Wool Factory has greatly improved. The factory sent experts to the Kulanovno factory to learn new methods of processing thick woolen cloth, and subsequently increased the percentage of first-grade products by 5.6% in the first month.

　　The Kulanovno Fine Wool Factory also helped the Troitsk Fine Wool Factory to find many production potentials, which enabled the factory to recently decide to complete the seven-year production plan ahead of schedule in five years. The Troitsk Fine Wool Factory had not done a good enough job in employee learning in the past, and the Kulanovno Factory also gave it great help. For example, they organized study evenings and invited employees from the Troitsk Fine Wool Factory to participate, introducing them to the experience of combining work and study. Under the leadership of the Kulanovno Fine Wool Factory, the Troitsk Fine Wool Factory has now formulated a three-year plan for employees' spare-time learning, and young employees have signed up to participate in the study.

　　The wave of collectives helping collectives surged forward, and the example of the Kulanovno Fine Wool Factory's concern for collectives was immediately emulated by other enterprises. For example, the employees of the Karabanovo Cotton Textile Factory in the Moscow region recently decided to help another factory that had difficulties in reducing production costs. They sent two comprehensive work teams composed of technicians, textile workers, foremen, economists, and accountants to support the factory, identify the problems, and formulate new measures to reduce production costs.

　　In addition to the form of one collective helping another, several collectives are now helping each other in the Soviet Union. For example, seven of the largest cotton textile joint enterprises in the Soviet Union, including Gloknov, Oleknov, Tashkent, Keson, Ivanovo, Leningrad, and the "Three Mountains" Textile Factory, have established regular and fixed contacts, launched competitions with each other, and exchanged experiences. Representatives of the seven enterprises held a meeting and decided that the seven collectives would learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses in the future, and exchange advanced technical information, rationalization proposals, and inventions in order to become advanced enterprises together. They also decided that the seven collectives would guarantee to overproduce products worth 127 million rubles beyond the plan each year, and increase labor productivity by 4.5%.

　　Many advanced mines and work teams in the Donbass coal mining sector are also actively discussing the issue of helping fraternal collectives catch up with advanced levels.

　　Some advanced production units of the Stalino Oblast Coal Mining Joint Enterprise have proposed to use the method of mutual assistance to ensure that there will be no backward mines or backward work sections within the enterprise in the near future. Some advanced work teams of the "Lutchinkov" Coal Mining Trust in this state have sent personnel to work in work teams that need help. Many advanced enterprises in the two cities of Konstantinovka and Kadievka in Donbass have put forward the goal of striving to ensure that there are no backward enterprises in the two cities.

    学习先进　帮助落后　互相支援　共求进步
    共产主义精神在苏联工业战线发扬光大
    一个集体帮助一个集体几个集体之间互相帮助
    新华社莫斯科电　学习先进、帮助落后、互相支援、共求进步的共产主义精神，正在苏联工业生产战线上的劳动人民中不断发扬光大。由共产党员加干诺娃去年首倡的先进帮助后进的运动，现在在苏联工业部门已经逐渐从个别先进生产者帮助一个后进单位发展到集体之间互相帮助、互相支援，许多工业企业的先进集体都相继同别的集体建立了联系。莫斯科州库兰夫诺细绒工厂全体职工不久前自愿帮助邻近的特罗伊特斯克细绒工厂把一切技术经济指标提高到先进企业的水平。这两个工厂建立联系以来，特罗伊特斯克细绒工厂的生产情况大有起色，这家工厂派了专家到库兰夫诺工厂学习了新的加工厚呢绒的方法，随后在第一个月内就使一级产品增加了5．6％。
    库兰夫诺细绒工厂还帮助特罗伊特斯克细绒工厂找出了许多生产潜力，使得这个工厂最近决定用五年时间提前完成七年生产计划。特罗伊特斯克细绒工厂过去在职工学习方面搞得不够好，库兰夫诺工厂也给了它极大的帮助。例如，组织学习晚会并邀请特罗伊特斯克细绒工厂的职工参加，向他们介绍如何把工作和学习结合起来的经验。在库兰夫诺细绒工厂的带动下，现在特罗伊特斯克细绒工厂已制定了职工业余学习的三年计划，青年职工都纷纷报名参加学习。
    集体帮助集体的热潮前浪推后浪，库兰夫诺细绒工厂的关心集体的榜样立即被其他企业仿效，如莫斯科州卡拉巴诺沃棉纺织工厂职工最近也决定帮助另一个在降低生产成本上有困难的工厂，他们派出了两个由技术员、纺织工人、工长、经济学家和会计员组成的综合工作队去支援这家工厂，为这家工厂找出问题所在并订出了降低生产成本的新措施。
    除了一个集体帮助另一个集体的形式外，现在在苏联还出现了几个集体间的互相帮助。例如，格洛克诺夫、奥列克诺夫、塔什干、刻松、伊凡诺佛、列宁格勒和“三山”纺织厂等七个苏联最大的棉纺织联合企业已经建立了经常固定的联系，互相展开竞赛，交流经验。这七个企业的代表开会决定，七个集体之间在今后互相取长补短，交换先进技术资料、合理化建议和创造发明，以求共同成为先进企业。他们还决定，七个集体每年要保证超计划生产价值一亿二千七百万卢布的产品，并把劳动生产率提高4．5％。
    顿巴斯的煤矿开采部门的许多先进矿井和工作队也都在纷纷讨论帮助兄弟集体赶上先进水平的问题。
    斯大林诺州采煤联合企业的一些先进生产单位都提出要用互相帮助的办法在最近期间使本企业内没有一个落后的矿井，没有一个落后的工作段。这个州的“鲁特钦科夫”采煤托辣斯的一些先进工作队已派出人员到需要帮助的工作队中去工作。顿巴斯的康斯坦丁诺夫卡和卡季耶夫卡两个城市的许多先进企业都已提出奋斗目标，要争取使两个城市没有一个落后企业。
