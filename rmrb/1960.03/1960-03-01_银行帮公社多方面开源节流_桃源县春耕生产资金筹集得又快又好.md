    Banks Help Communes Open Up New Revenue Streams and Curtail Spending
    Taoyuan County's Spring Planting Production Funds Raised Quickly and Effectively

    (Our dispatch from Changsha, 29th) Under the leadership of the Taoyuan County Committee, the banks and credit cooperatives of Hunan Province have actively and proactively assisted communes in organizing and coordinating production funds from various aspects, effectively meeting the needs of spring planting production funds.

    This year, the early rice planting area in Taoyuan County has expanded by 21% compared to last year. In order to accelerate agricultural technology transformation, this year's capital construction expenditures are also higher than in previous years. Therefore, the production funds needed this year have greatly increased compared to last year. Due to the expansion of the replanting area and the early production season, a large amount of production funds must also be used in advance. Looking at the first quarter alone, 11.61 million yuan in cash needs to be disbursed, accounting for 63.4% of the total expenditure for the first half of the year. In response to the above situation, at the end of last year, the Taoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the vast number of cadres and the masses to quickly take effective measures, fully tap the potential of funds, achieve increased revenue and reduced expenditure, and make up for the funding shortfall. Under this call, banks and credit cooperatives took the lead and actively invested in the preparation of production funds. The banking sector drew more than 60 cadres to form seven inspection teams, and before the Spring Festival, they went deep into the communes and production teams to conduct investigations.

    Based on the information gathered in the survey, more than 400 bank and credit cooperative cadres throughout the county went deep down, established more than 360 business bases, and helped the communes and teams calculate their production needs, their own funds, material accounts, and national support accounts, so that cadres and commune members had a clear understanding and clarified the direction of their efforts.

    In order to make the plan more practical and completely solve the funding problem, the banking sector has taken a series of effective measures. The first is to vigorously organize idle funds in rural areas and vigorously promote rural savings. Before and after the Spring Festival, the county organized a propaganda team of more than 40,000 teachers, students, and commune and team cadres, and used various forms of publicity to promote the benefits of saving and supporting production. The county, communes, and brigades all established savings promotion committees, and savings service stations were set up in production teams, with one savings assistant for every ten households. From January to now, the idle funds organized through savings in the county have reached more than 860,000 yuan.

    Secondly, assisting commune members in clearing inventory materials. After clearing, there were still a lot of materials scattered in the warehouses of the communes and teams, such as peanuts, cotton, and tung oil. The banking sector, in conjunction with the commercial sector, frequently carried out large-scale purchasing campaigns. Through the purchase of inventory materials, a total of more than 570,000 yuan was collected. Bank cadres also mobilized the production teams to clean up and repair more than 170,000 pieces of various farm tools. In addition, the inventory of cash and current deposits was cleared, and a total of more than 350,000 yuan was collected.

    Third, vigorously assist communes in developing diversified operations. This year, the state's supply of commodity production materials cannot fully meet the needs. In this case, the banking sector immediately assisted the communes and teams to take the method of taking materials locally, manufacturing locally, and supplying locally, and vigorously carried out self-sufficient production. Up to now, the county has produced more than 2.1 million dan of local fertilizer, more than 10,000 dan of local pesticides, and 820,000 dan of lime. In addition, the communes and teams also organized 3,390 iron, wood, and bamboo workers to manufacture more than 270,000 pieces of farm tools of various sizes. According to preliminary estimates, the above-mentioned self-sufficient production can save more than 1.53 million yuan in cash expenditure. There is even more income in terms of commodity production. The county has found 82 ways to produce, such as digging medicinal materials and making grass paper. From January to now, it has exchanged more than 3.65 million yuan in cash.

    Fourth, help communes and brigades establish accounts and financial management systems. After these systems were generally established, the county quickly reduced non-productive expenditures by more than 210,000 yuan.

    Through these effective measures, the People's Bank of Taoyuan County has solved the county's production funding problem quickly and well. All the production funds needed during the spring planting production period in the county have been fully prepared.

    银行帮公社多方面开源节流
    桃源县春耕生产资金筹集得又快又好
    本报长沙29日电　湖南省桃源县银行、信用部门在县委领导下，积极主动地从多方面协助公社组织和统筹安排生产资金，有效地满足了春耕生产资金的需要。
    今年，桃源县早稻播种面积比去年扩大21％，为了加速农业技术改造，今年基本建设支出也多于往年，因此今年所需要的生产资金较去年大为增加。由于今年复种面积扩大、生产季节提前，大量的生产资金也必须提前使用。就第一季度来看，要支出现金一千一百六十一万元，占上半年总支出的63．4％。针对上述情况，中共桃源县委在去年年底就号召广大干部和群众迅速采取有效措施，充分挖掘资金潜力，做到开源节流，弥补资金差额。在这一号召下，银行和信用部门一马当先，积极投入安排生产资金的准备工作。银行部门抽出六十多个干部组成七个检查组，在春节前深入到各公社和生产队作了调查。
    根据调查中了解的情况，全县四百多个银行、信用干部都深入下去，建立了三百六十多个业务基点，帮助各社、队算生产需要账，自有资金、物资账，国家支援账，使干部、社员心中有底，明确了奋斗方向。
    为了使规划更加落实，彻底解决资金问题，银行部门采取了一系列的有效措施。首先是大力组织农村闲散资金，大搞农村储蓄。春节前后，全县组织了教师、学生、社队干部等四万多人的宣传队伍，利用各种宣传形式，宣传节约储蓄、支援生产的好处，县、社和大队都成立了节约储蓄促进委员会，并以生产队为单位设立了储蓄服务站，每十户有一个协储员。元月份到现在，全县通过储蓄组织的闲散资金已达八十六万多元。
    其次，协助社员清理库存物资。经过清理，各社、队散存在仓库的物资如花生、棉花、桐油等还不少，银行部门与商业部门结合，经常开展大收大购运动，通过收购库存物资，共收入五十七万多元。银行干部还发动各生产队清理和整修了各种农具十七万多件。另外，清理库存现款和往来存款，共收集了三十五万多元。
    第三，大力协助公社开展多种经营。今年国家供应的商品性生产资料不能完全满足需要。在这种情况下，银行部门立即协助各社、队采取就地取材、就地制造、就地供应办法，大搞自给性生产。到目前止，全县已生产出土化肥二十一万多担，土农药一万多担，石灰八十二万担。另外，各社、队还组织了铁、木、篾工三千三百九十人，自制大小农具二十七万多件。以上这些自给性的生产，据初步估计可节省现金支出一百五十三万多元。在商品性生产方面，收入就更多了。全县已找到挖药材、做草纸等生产门路八十二种，从元月份到现在，已换回现金三百六十五万多元。
    第四，帮助公社、大队建立账目和财务管理制度。这些制度普遍建立后，全县很快就削减了非生产性开支二十一万多元。
    桃源县人民银行通过这些有效措施，使全县生产资金问题解决得又快又好。全县春耕生产期间所需要的生产资金已经全部备足。
