　　Bumper Harvest of Grains, Flourishing of Six Domestic Animals, Lush Green Trees
　　Baicheng Combines and Promotes Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Forestry
　　(Our Dispatch) The Baicheng area of Jilin Province is giving full play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, adopting the policy of "equal emphasis on agriculture and animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously strengthening forestry construction," and skillfully arranging and combining agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry to promote each other and achieve comprehensive and high-speed development.
　　The Baicheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the Party's guidelines and policies and the characteristics of the area, conducted multiple investigations and research, and formulated the policy of "equal emphasis on agriculture and animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously strengthening forestry construction" according to local conditions. This policy fully utilized the advantages of the people's communes' large organizational scale and wide range of activities, and adopted various measures to solve problems such as having more cultivated land but less labor in the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. This transformed the mutually contradictory relationships between the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry into mutually promoting relationships. Local Party organizations, adhering to the principle of "taking grain as the key link, farming where suitable, raising livestock where suitable, and planting trees where suitable," implemented comprehensive planning and unified arrangements through division of labor and the establishment of specialized organizations, achieving planting according to local conditions, rational grazing, rational land use, and rational resource utilization. For example, in land use planning, they ensured the continuous expansion of cultivated land area while fixing pastures to prevent grassland from being destroyed. Large amounts of barren cultivated land were taken out of cultivation for afforestation. Forest belts and networks were intercropped with grain. To solve the labor shortage, all areas focused on key tasks without neglecting general tasks according to different seasons and production tasks. For example, during busy farming seasons, they appropriately merged livestock herds and drew some labor from animal husbandry to support agricultural production; after weeding, they appropriately transferred agricultural labor to collect and store feed to support animal husbandry. In forestry, agricultural work was the priority during busy farming seasons, combined with afforestation and forest cultivation. Many communes achieved "specialization in one skill with multiple capabilities, and one person with multiple jobs" in labor utilization, with herders also serving as forest rangers and field guards; warehouse keepers also serving as feeders and night watchmen.
　　To ensure the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and with a long-term perspective combined with current interests, the Prefectural Committee vigorously strengthened the leadership of forestry construction. Specialized organizations were established at all levels throughout the area, and various methods were adopted to train more than 6,000 farmer-forestry technicians. Communes extensively launched mass seedling cultivation campaigns, establishing 226 nurseries and commune-run forest farms, resolving the difficulty of insufficient seedlings. Party organizations at all levels included forestry in their main agenda when leading agricultural production, making long-term preparations and short-term intensive efforts, and conducting year-round afforestation and forest cultivation campaigns in conjunction with agricultural production. To carry out the "one spring plowing, two sowings" campaign, various areas created many methods. Qian'an, Tongyu, and other counties implemented three-shift mating (field-side, trough-side, midday), setting up stations in the fields, mating at night, and sending semen to the teams, which ensured both timely sowing and timely mating of livestock. Various areas also adopted the "walking on two legs" policy of purebred, crossbred, local improved breeds, and artificial insemination combined with natural mating, which further accelerated the breeding rate of livestock and improved the quality of livestock.
　　Adopting the method of combining agriculture and animal husbandry to develop animal husbandry also provided productive power and high-quality fertilizer for agricultural development. To accelerate livestock breeding and improvement, specialized scientific management was implemented, and 13,645 livestock farms were established in the fields throughout the area. These livestock farms provided large amounts of manure because they were close to farmland. In 1959, 37.5 million tons of fertilizer were applied, most of which was animal manure, increasing the unit fertilizer application rate by 25% compared to 1958. The Qianjin Management District of the Longyan People's Commune in Da'an County raised 1,457 pigs in 1959, averaging 3.5 pigs per household. Because more highly effective pig manure fertilizer was applied, grain production increased by 47% compared to 1958. The development of agriculture also promoted the development of animal husbandry. In Zhenlai County, just ten communes planted more than 3,000 hectares of feed crops in 1959, ensuring the supply of feed. In particular, the great development of forestry created favorable natural conditions for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry and provided a rich material foundation. Last year, the area intercropped forests with grain on more than 35,000 hectares, planting forests and harvesting more than 90,000 tons of grain.
　　The close combination and mutual promotion of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry led to comprehensive and high-speed development. Last year, the total grain output of the entire area increased by 9.1% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with an average per capita grain possession of 1,700 jin, an increase of 20% compared to 1958. Large livestock increased by 9.8% compared to 1958, pigs increased by more than 40%, and sheep and goats increased by 39%. Nearly 300,000 hectares of shelterbelts and timber forests, economic forests, etc. were created, and the forest cover rate increased from 2.5% in the early days of liberation to 9.1%. Now, farmland shelterbelts are intertwined into networks, mobile sand dunes are covered in green, green corridors have been built along roads, and everywhere presents a thriving scene of "bumper harvests of grains and flourishing of six domestic animals."

    五谷丰登　六畜兴旺　绿树成荫
    白城农牧林相互结合相互促进
    本报讯　吉林省白城地区充分发挥人民公社的无比优越性，采取“农牧并重，农牧结合，大力加强林业建设”的方针，把农、牧、林三者巧安排，巧结合，相互促进，获得全面高速度的发展。
    中共白城地委根据党的方针、政策和这个地区的特点，曾经进行了多次调查研究，因地制宜地制定了“农牧并重，农牧结合，大力加强林业建设”的方针，充分发挥了人民公社组织规模大、活动范围广的优越性，采取多种多样的措施，解决了在农、牧、林的发展上出现的耕地多劳力少等问题。使农业、牧业、林业发展之间的互相矛盾的关系，变成了互相促进的关系。各地党组织都本着“以粮为纲，宜农则农，宜牧则牧，宜林则林”的原则，通过全面规划，统一安排，实行分工分业，建立专业组织，作到了因地种植，合理放牧，合理利用土地，合理利用资源。例如在土地规划使用上，保证耕地面积不断扩大，同时固定了牧场，使草原不被破坏。大量的瘠薄耕地都停耕造林。林带林网则实行林、粮间种。为了解决劳力不足，各地都按不同季节和生产任务，既突出重点，又不放松一般。比如每到农忙季节，就适当合并畜群，从畜牧业抽出一部分人力支援农业生产；锄后又适当调动农业劳力，收贮饲料，支援牧业。在林业上，农忙季节，则以农为主，结合进行造林育林。很多公社在劳力使用上做到“一专多能，一人多职”，放牧员兼护林员，又是护田员；保管员兼饲养员，又是更夫。
    为了保证农、牧业的发展，从长远打算着眼，又结合目前利益，地委大力加强了林业建设的领导。全区从上到下层层建立专业机构，并且采取各种办法培养了六千多名农民林业技术员。各公社广泛开展了群众性育苗运动，建立苗圃和社办林场二百二十六处，解决了苗木不足的困难。各级党组织在领导农业生产中，都把林业列入了主要日程，长期准备，短期突击，结合农业生产开展常年造林、育林运动。各地为了开展“一个春耕，两个播种”运动，创造了许多办法。乾安、通榆等县执行了三头配种（地头、槽头、晌午头）、田间设站、夜间配种、送精到队等方法，既不误农时，又使牲畜适时配种。各地还采取纯种、杂种、地方良种和人工授精与本交配种的“两条腿走路”的方针，更加速牲畜的繁殖率，也提高了牲畜的质量。
    采取农、牧结合的办法发展了畜牧业，也为农业的发展提供了生产动力和优质肥料。为了加速牲畜繁殖改良，实行专业化的科学管理，全区在田间建立了一万三千六百四十五处畜牧场。这些畜牧场由于靠近农田，提供了大量粪肥。1959年施肥三千七百五十万吨，其中大多是畜粪，单位施肥量比1958年提高25％。大安县龙沿人民公社前进管理区1959年养猪一千四百五十七口，每户平均有三头半，由于多施了肥效高的猪粪肥，粮食产量比1958年提高47％。农业的发展又促进了牧业的发展。镇赉县仅十个公社在1959年就种了三千多公顷饲料地，保证了饲料的供应。特别是林业的大发展，为农、牧业的发展创造了良好的自然条件，提供了丰富的物质基础。去年，全区采取林、粮间种，面积达三万五千多公顷，既植林又收获了粮食九万多吨。
    农、牧、林紧密结合，相互促进，获得了全面高速度的发展。去年，全区粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年提高9．1％，平均每人占有粮食达一千七百斤，比1958年提高20％。大家畜比1958年增长9．8％，猪增长40％以上，绵羊、山羊增长39％。营造防护林和栽植用材林、经济林等近三十万公顷，森林被复率由解放初期的2．5％增到9．1％。现在农田防护林交织成网，流动的沙丘穿上了绿色新装，道路两旁造起了绿色的长廊，到处呈现着“五谷丰登、六畜兴旺”的欣欣向荣景象。
