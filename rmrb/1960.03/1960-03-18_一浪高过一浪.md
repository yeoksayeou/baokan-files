    One Wave Higher Than Another

    In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in factories in the Wuchang District of Wuhan City, in order to further change the technical outlook of the entire district, the slogan of "one heart, one mind, district-wide collaboration, and vigorously promoting 'seven transformations'" was proposed. This slogan not only reflects the ambitions of the workers in Wuchang District to change the technical status quo, but also introduces a leadership method of carrying out large-scale technical innovation collaboration in an organized, led, and planned manner.

    The process of technical innovation is often from shallow to deep, from low to high, and from simple to complex. Since the vigorous promotion of technical innovation, factories and enterprises have reformed many major key projects. In the future, continued reform is needed. The content of the reform is not only numerous in projects and broad in scope, but the degree of difficulty and complexity will certainly exceed the past. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to strengthen organization and leadership, strengthen planning, further promote the communist spirit, dare to think and act more boldly, and better solve difficult technical problems with one heart and one mind.

    Promoting the communist spirit is not only necessary for further vigorously promoting technical innovation, but also a reflection of the technical revolution movement. Countless facts prove that all inventions and creations are the result of daring to think and act, and are the result of the support and help of all parties. It can be seen that the great harvest of technical innovation must also be a great harvest of promoting communist ideology. The great liberation of productive forces will inevitably promote a great change in people's thinking; the climax of the technical revolution must also be a climax of the great promotion of communist ideology. Strengthening organizational leadership and planning in this regard can promote this climax.

    The situation before us is: due to the progress of technology, the progress of thought has been greatly promoted; the progress in thinking, in turn, promotes the progress of technology. Such a spiral advancement has created a new situation of one wave higher than another. The practice of Wuchang District in vigorously promoting communist collaboration in an organized, led, and planned manner is a good leadership method for further deepening technical innovation.

    一浪高过一浪
    武汉市武昌区各工厂在大闹技术革新技术革命的群众运动中，为了进一步改变全区的技术面貌，提出了一条心、一个劲、全区协作，大闹“七变”的口号。这个口号不仅反映了武昌区职工改变技术现状的雄心壮志，而且也介绍了一种有组织、有领导、有计划地开展技术革新大协作的领导方法。
    技术革新的过程，往往是由浅入深、由低到高、由简到繁的。大闹技术革新以来，厂矿企业改革了许多重大的关键项目，今后，需要继续改革。改革的内容，不仅项目多、方面广，而且繁难复杂的程度，肯定要超过以往。在这样的情况下，加强组织领导，加强计划性，进一步发扬共产主义风格，更加敢想敢干，更好地一条心、一个劲地解决繁难的技术问题，就显得特别重要了。
    发扬共产主义风格，这不仅为进一步大搞技术革新所必需，而且也是技术革命运动的反映。无数的事实证明，所有的发明创造，无一不是敢想敢干的结果，无一不是在各方面的支持帮助下取得的结果。由此可见，技术革新的大丰收，也必然是发扬共产主义思想的大丰收。生产力的大解放，必然会推动人们思想面貌的大改变；技术革命的高潮，也必然是共产主义思想大发扬的高潮。加强这方面的组织领导和计划性，就可以推动这个高潮。
    摆在我们面前的形势是：由于技术的进步，大大推动了思想的进步；思想上的进步，反过来又推动了技术的进步。这样螺旋式地前进，就造成了一浪高过一浪的新形势。武昌区这种有组织、有领导、有计划地大搞共产主义协作的作法，就是进一步深入开展技术革新的一种好的领导方法。
