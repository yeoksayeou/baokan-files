The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council have issued instructions on vigorously promoting spring fishing production, calling on regions and units with fishery production tasks to mobilize the masses and actively make all preparations to strive for an all-round bumper harvest in spring production in the sea, lakes, rivers, and streams.

Of the three main fishing periods in a year, spring, autumn, and winter, the spring fishing season is the main harvest season for fishery production. At sea, economic fish such as large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, cuttlefish, mackerel, and prawns migrate northward for spawning, with dense schools of fish that are easy to catch. Historically, the production volume during this season accounts for about half of the total annual marine fishery production. In freshwater, spring is also the peak season for catching mature fish and fish fry and fingerlings. Therefore, grasping spring fishing production is not only of great significance for completing the annual fishery production but also lays a good foundation for future development of freshwater aquaculture.

Striving for a greater bumper harvest in spring fishing production plays a huge role in improving people's lives and supporting national construction. Aquatic products such as fish and shrimp are nutritious and have always been delicious foods for people in coastal areas and those near rivers and lakes. Even some areas that did not eat aquatic products in the past are now raising and eating fish. Aquatic products have become a popular non-staple food for the masses. Fish, shrimp, and other aquatic products are also important export commodities for our country. One ton of frozen fish fillets can be exchanged for 8.2 tons of steel, and one ton of fresh prawns can be exchanged for 6 tons of steel. A bumper spring harvest can not only further improve people's lives but also better organize exports and exchange for machinery and industrial equipment from abroad, supporting national construction.

The main characteristic of the spring fishing season is its short duration. Therefore, to achieve a bumper harvest in spring fishing production, it is necessary to ensure that fishing boats go to sea in time for fishing. Missing the opportunity will result in a large reduction in production. Therefore, doing a good job of all preparatory work before the spring fishing season and ensuring more production time during the spring fishing season is the key to striving for an all-round bumper harvest in spring production. In the preparatory work, the first is to put politics in command and do a good job in ideological work, so that all fishermen and employees of state-owned aquatic enterprises deeply understand the political and economic significance of striving for a bumper harvest in spring fishing production. Secondly, it is necessary to effectively do a good job in material preparation. Having fishing tools and sufficient fishery supplies is the only way to ensure a bumper harvest in the spring fishing season. At the beginning of this year's fishing season, Fujian Province caught 1.25 million dan of fish products in 20 days due to the good material preparation work, an increase of 42% compared with the same period last year. In the preparation of material resources, special attention should be paid to the repair and addition of boats and nets. Boats and nets are the basic tools for fishing production. More boats and nets that are strong and easy to use ensure increased production. Coastal areas should seize the time to organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers to inspect and repair boats and nets, ensuring that all boats are repaired and all nets are mended before going to sea. Dalian City in Liaoning Province has put forward the slogan "Let the boats wait for the sea, not the sea wait for the boats." Coastal fishing areas have adopted the method of "everyone participates, men and women are not idle, digging internally and searching externally, mobilizing inside and out," and have repaired more than 460 large boats and mended more than 27,000 fishing nets ahead of schedule. All fishing areas in the country should do the same.

Safety is a very important issue in fishery production. Only by achieving safe production can we achieve a greater harvest. Before going to sea, a thorough safety production inspection must be carried out, and effective measures must be taken to make up for all possible loopholes that may cause accidents, and thorough safety arrangements must be made. In this regard, various fishing areas have accumulated rich experience, such as forming fleets according to the tonnage and wind resistance performance of fishing boats, implementing motorized sailing boats leading wooden sailing boats, large boats leading small boats, those with high technology leading those with low technology, those familiar with fishing grounds leading those unfamiliar with fishing grounds, those with radios leading those without radios, etc. These are all good ways to ensure safe production and should be seriously promoted.

Freshwater fishing is an important part of the entire spring fishing production. Only by achieving a bumper harvest in freshwater fishing can we achieve an all-round bumper harvest in the spring fishing season. In freshwater fishery production, we must focus on two links: fish fry production and mature fish fishing. While vigorously catching mature fish, this year we should pay special attention to the capture of fish fry and fingerlings. Spring is the season when freshwater fish lay eggs in large quantities and is a critical time for catching fish fry. Every year during this period, provinces along the Yangtze River set up a large number of seedling nets in the river to catch fish fry. In order to adapt to the needs of the great development of fishery production, this year we must add nets, improve fishing methods, catch large quantities of fish fry and fingerlings, and vigorously improve the survival rate of fish fry, providing more fish fry and fingerlings for the development of freshwater aquaculture in our country.

Close cooperation between various departments, especially fishery departments and commercial departments, is an important guarantee for an all-round bumper harvest in the spring fishing season. The spring fishing season requires many types and large quantities of materials; the spring fishing season produces concentrated fish catches, high commodity rates, and strong freshness of fish products. This requires aquatic product supply and marketing departments and commercial departments to do a good job in material supply and procurement, as well as processing, refrigeration, and transportation. In some places, on the basis of improving the original procurement points, mobile procurement points and sea procurement boats have been added. This method can both purchase more fish products, meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets, and facilitate fishermen, allowing them to have more production time. This is a good way to achieve multiple goals at once and should be universally promoted.

The spring fishing season is approaching. In the fishing season, every moment is precious. Party committees in various fishing areas must vigorously strengthen their leadership over spring fishing production, do a good job in all preparatory work, and ensure that this year's spring fishing season achieves an all-round bumper harvest.

    争取春季渔汛大丰收
    中共中央和国务院发布了关于大力做好渔业春汛生产工作的指示，号召有渔业生产任务的地区和单位，发动群众，积极做好一切准备，争取海、湖、江、河春汛生产全面丰收。
    渔业生产一年之内有春汛、秋汛、冬汛三个主要的捕鱼期。春汛是渔业生产中的主要收获季节。在海洋方面，大黄鱼、小黄鱼、墨鱼、鲐鱼等经济鱼类和对虾，自南向北作产卵洄游，鱼群密集，便于捕捞。历年来，这个汛期的生产量，占全年海洋渔业生产的一半左右。在淡水方面，春季也是捕捞成鱼和鱼苗鱼种的旺季。因此，抓好春汛生产，不仅对于完成全年渔业生产具有重要的意义，同时也为今后发展淡水养殖业，打下良好的基础。
    争取春汛生产更大丰收，对于改善人民生活，支援国家建设都有巨大作用。鱼虾等水产品，营养丰富，历来是沿海和临近江河湖泊地区人民的鲜美食品。就是过去一些不吃水产品的地区现在也养鱼吃鱼了。水产品已经成为广大群众所喜爱的一种副食品。鱼虾等水产品也是我国重要的出口商品，一吨冻鱼片可换回八点二吨钢材，一吨鲜对虾可换回六吨钢材。春汛大丰收不仅可以进一步改善人民生活，也可以更好地组织出口，从国外换机器和工业设备，支援国家建设。
    春汛的主要特点是时间短促。因此，要获得春汛大丰收，就必须保证渔船及时出海进行捕捞。错过时机，就要大量减产。因此，做好春汛前的一切准备工作，保证在春汛期间有更多的生产作业时间，是争取春汛生产全面丰收的关键。在准备工作中，首先是实行政治挂帅，做好思想工作，要使全体渔民和国营水产企业职工深刻认识争取春汛生产大丰收的政治意义与经济意义。其次要切实做好物资准备工作。有了捕捞工具和充足的渔需物资，才能保证春汛大丰收。今年年初渔汛期间，福建省由于物资准备工作做得好，二十天中捕捞鱼产品一百二十五万担，比去年同期增产42％。在物质资料准备中，要特别重视船网的修补和添置。船和网是捕鱼生产的基本工具，船网多，结实好使，增产就有了保障。沿海各地要抓紧时间，组织所有的整半劳动力投入检查和修补船网工作，保证在出海以前，把所有的船只都修好，把所有的网都补牢。辽宁省旅大市提出了“要叫船等海，不叫海等船”的口号，沿海渔区采取了“人人动手，男女不闲，内挖外找，里外动员”的办法，已提前修好四百六十多只大船，补好两万七千多片渔网。全国各渔区都应该这样做。
    安全问题是渔业生产中的一个十分重要的问题，只有作到了安全生产，才能取得更大的丰收。出海前要认真作好安全生产检查，一定要采取切实有效措施弥补一切可能发生事故的漏洞，并进行周密的安全部署。这方面，各渔区已经积累了丰富的经验，比如按照渔船吨位、抗风性能进行编队，实行机帆船带木帆船，大船带小船，技术高的带技术低的，熟悉渔场的带不熟悉渔场的，有收音机的带没有收音机的等等，都是保证安全生产的好办法，应该认真推广。
    淡水捕捞是整个春汛生产的一个重要的组成部分。取得淡水捕捞的丰收，才能取得春汛的全面大丰收。在淡水渔业生产中，要抓紧鱼苗生产和成鱼捕捞两个环节，在大力捕捞成鱼的同时，今年应特别重视鱼苗鱼种的捕捞工作。春季是淡水鱼大量产卵的季节，是捕捞鱼苗的紧要关头，每年在这个时期，长江沿岸各省都在江里大量架起捕苗绠网捕捞鱼苗。为了适应渔业生产大发展的需要，今年要增添网具，改进捕捞方法，大量捕捞鱼苗鱼种，并大力提高鱼苗的成活率，为发展我国的淡水养殖业提供更多的鱼苗鱼种。
    各个部门特别是渔业部门和商业部门密切协作，是春汛全面丰收的一个重要保证。春汛需要的物资品类多，数量大；春汛生产鱼货集中，商品率高，而且鱼品的鲜活性强；这就需要水产供销部门和商业部门作好物资供应和收购工作以及加工、冷藏、运输等工作。有些地方，在健全原来收购点的基础上，增设流动收购点、海上收购船。这种办法，既能够多收购鱼产品，满足国内外市场的需要；又便利了渔民，使他们有更多的生产时间。这是一项一举两得的好办法，应当普遍推广。
    春汛时间已经迫近，汛期一刻金不换，渔区各地党委要大力加强对春汛生产的领导，做好一切准备工作，保证今年春汛获得全面丰收。
