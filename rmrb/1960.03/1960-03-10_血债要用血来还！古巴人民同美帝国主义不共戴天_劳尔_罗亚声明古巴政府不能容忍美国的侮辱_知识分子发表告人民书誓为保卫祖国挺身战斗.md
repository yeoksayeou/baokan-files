Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 8th – The Cuban government today rejected the threatening statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Herter on March 7th to the Cuban Chargé d'Affaires. Herter's statement was made after Cuban Prime Minister Castro condemned the United States for the "La Coubre" ship explosion incident.

Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa issued a statement to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Havana this afternoon, announcing the Cuban government's official position:

"First, the Cuban Revolutionary Government rejects the statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter to the Cuban Chargé d'Affaires in Washington, Enrique Patterson, because it is insulting. Second, we demand that the U.S. government, when speaking to representatives of the Cuban government, absolutely respect their diplomatic positions in accordance with diplomatic practice and refrain from insulting personal dignity. Third, we protest the tone of the aforementioned statement, which slanders and offends our national dignity, and we await the note that (the U.S.) has announced it will issue, in order to make an appropriate reply to Your Excellency's government."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 8th – Cuban women have begun activities nationwide to celebrate the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day. The celebrations are being carried out under the banner of opposing U.S. aggression and resolutely defending the revolution. At rallies held in the capital and other cities, Cuban women condemned the despicable sabotage of the "La Coubre" ship and denounced the instigator of the incident, U.S. imperialism.

Under the auspices of the Cuban Revolutionary Women's League, a grand and enthusiastic celebration was held in Havana. At the meeting, the women unanimously rose and applauded the adoption of a telegram to Washington, opposing the U.S. State Department's statement on the "La Coubre" ship explosion on March 5th, which expressed "hypocritical and sanctimonious" condolences to the Cuban people without mentioning the Cuban government. Women's militias also participated in the meeting. The meeting decided to launch a large-scale people's donation campaign to purchase weapons and aircraft, and decided to further develop the movement to organize women's militias. Speakers at the meeting expressed their desire for peace, supported the cessation of nuclear testing and universal disarmament, and expressed their support for the people of Latin America under the oppression of tyranny.

The Secretary-General of the Spanish Women's League, exiled in Cuba, said at the meeting that they would take up arms to defend Cuba against imperialist aggression.

The Cuban women's celebrations for the "March 8th" International Women's Day will last for a week.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 8th – One hundred and fifty-nine prominent Cuban intellectuals, writers, and artists today issued a proclamation to the Cuban people regarding the U.S.-engineered "La Coubre" ship ammunition explosion, which resulted in the loss of 72 Cuban lives and injured more than 200 people.

The proclamation pointed out that hostile forces at home and abroad are conspiring to launch an aggression against Cuba. Foreign mercenaries, fascists, Nazis, Cuban traitors from the "White Rose" organization, and Trujillo supporters are the vanguard of the invasion of Cuba. The proclamation also stated that the U.S. press has been carrying out a series of attacks against our country for months, the main purpose of which is to create pretexts for direct intervention on our soil, or to land Marines already stationed in Puerto Rico.

The proclamation emphasized that we intellectuals, writers, and artists know that this merely means that the Cuban revolution has reached a decisive moment. Today, any pacifist foolishness on our part would benefit the enemy. Therefore, we should stand up and face the war, and we are determined to defend the motherland. If necessary, we will defend it with our lives.

The proclamation was signed by Marinello Guillén, Carlos Rafael Rodríguez, Violeta Casal, Isabel Monal, and Carlos Franqui, director of "Revolución" newspaper, among others.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 8th – The Cuban "26th of July Movement" organ "Revolución" published an editorial today condemning the U.S. government's attempt to evade its undeniable responsibility for the criminal sabotage of the "La Coubre" ship.

The editorial said that the United States is screaming hysterically that it is "threatened." This U.S. hysterical cry is merely to cover up the aggression it intends to carry out.

Referring to the active preparations by U.S. imperialism for armed intervention in Cuba, the editorial emphasized that the aggression is ready, and all that is lacking is the creation of the diplomatic conditions needed to launch the aggression. Napalm bombs, flamethrowers, and planes carrying atomic bombs are all ready. Therefore, what does it matter to those who dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to carry out a massacre in a small Caribbean country?

"National Daily," in an editorial it published, pointed out that the "La Coubre" ship was blown up by those who stubbornly refused to allow the Cuban revolutionary government to purchase weapons for self-defense. The editorial emphasized that no one can deny that planes are concentrated at some airports in Florida in the United States for the purpose of attacking Cuba.

Referring to the next step in the U.S.'s aggressive plot in engineering the "La Coubre" ship explosion, an editorial published by "Combat Newspaper" pointed out that United Press International, a conspiratorial accomplice with close ties to Wall Street, provided the answer. Its March 5th dispatch boasted of the U.S.'s role in overthrowing the democratic government of Guatemala, which was overthrown two days after its self-defense weapons were transported into the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 8th – The Cuban "Revolución" once again pointed out that the ones who engineered the explosion of the "La Coubre" were the same guys who unhesitatingly dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The corpses of those who died under the poisonous hands of the imperialists are constantly being discovered, and the unbearable scenes are arousing the Cuban people's increasingly strong hatred of the imperialists. In Havana harbor, due to ships sailing out and stirring up the seawater in the bay, incomplete corpses of the dead continue to surface. A Cuban boy found his father's foot because he recognized the pattern tattooed on it.

An indignant mother, standing in front of her son's remains, wept and questioned the imperialists who committed this crime: Why did you kill my son, his young children still need his care.

Havana newspapers continue to publish photographs of missing persons and the desperate missing persons notices of their families. The Cuban maritime police continue to search for the remains of the dead and are constantly making discoveries. More than 1,000 members of the Ministry of Health's revolutionary teams are still working in the rubble of Havana Harbor. The strong odor permeating the affected area indicates that Cuban victims killed by the imperialists are still buried under the rubble.

    血债要用血来还！
    古巴人民同美帝国主义不共戴天
    劳尔·罗亚声明古巴政府不能容忍美国的侮辱
    知识分子发表告人民书誓为保卫祖国挺身战斗
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴政府今天拒绝了美国国务卿赫脱7日对古巴代办发表的威胁性声明。赫脱的这篇声明是在古巴总理卡斯特罗就“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件谴责美国后发表的。
    古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚今天下午对美国驻哈瓦那外交代办发表声明，宣布了古巴政府的正式立场：
  “第一，古巴革命政府拒绝美国国务卿克里斯琴·赫脱先生向古巴驻华盛顿代办恩里克·派特逊发表的声明，因为它是侮辱性的。第二，我们要求美国政府在对古巴政府代表讲话时要根据外交惯例绝对尊重他们的外交职务，不得污辱个人人格。第三，我们抗议上述声明中中伤和冒犯我们民族尊严的语气，我们等待着（美国）已经宣布要发出的照会，以便向阁下的政府作出适当的答复。”
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴妇女开始在全国展开庆祝国际妇女节五十周年的活动。庆祝活动是在反对美国侵略和坚决保卫革命的标志下进行的。在首都及其他一些城市举行的集会上，古巴妇女谴责对“勒库布尔号”轮船的卑劣的破坏，并且斥责这一事件的制造者美帝国主义。
    在古巴革命妇女联盟的主持下，在哈瓦那举行了盛大和热烈的庆祝大会。会上妇女们一致起立鼓掌通过了致华盛顿的电报，反对美国国务院5日就“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件发表的声明不提古巴政府而向古巴人民表示“虚伪的和伪善的”哀悼。妇女民兵也参加了这次大会。大会决定开展大规模的购买武器和飞机的人民捐献运动，决定进一步开展组织妇女民兵的运动。在会上发言的人表示了和平的愿望，支持停止核试验和普遍裁军；并且表示支援在暴政压迫下的拉丁美洲人民。
    流亡在古巴的西班牙妇女联盟总书记在会上说，她们将拿起武器保卫古巴，反对帝国主义侵略。
    古巴妇女为“三八”国际妇女节举行的庆祝活动将延续一周。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　一百五十九位杰出的古巴知识分子、作家和艺术家今天就美国制造的“勒库布尔号”轮船军火爆炸事件发表了告古巴人民书，这次爆炸事件使七十二个古巴人丧失了生命，二百多人受伤。
    告人民书指出，国内外敌对势力正在阴谋对古巴发动侵略。外国雇佣兵、法西斯分子、纳粹分子、“白玫瑰”组织中的古巴卖国分子和特鲁希略分子是入侵古巴的先锋队。告人民书又说，美国报界数月来就对我国进行着一系列的攻击，这些攻击的主要目的是制造借口，以便直接在我国土地上进行干涉，或是使已经安顿在波多黎各的海军陆战队登陆。
    告人民书强调指出，我们知识分子、作家和艺术家知道，这仅仅意味着，古巴的革命已经面临决定性的时刻。今天我们这方面如果抱有和平主义的愚蠢态度是对敌人有利的。因此，我们应挺身而出应付战争，并决心保卫祖国。假如需要就用生命来保卫它。
    在告人民书上，签名的有马里内略·纪廉、卡洛斯·拉斐尔·罗德里格斯、比奥莱塔·卡萨耳、伊萨维耳·莫纳耳和“革命报”社长卡洛斯·弗兰吉等人。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴7月26日运动机关报“革命报”今天发表社论，谴责美国政府企图逃避它对“勒库布尔号”轮船进行罪恶破坏所负的无可否认的责任。
    社论说，美国声嘶力竭地威胁说它“受到威胁”。美国这种歇斯底里的叫喊不过是为了掩饰它所要进行的侵略。
    在谈到美帝国主义积极准备对古巴进行武装干涉时，社论强调指出，侵略已经准备就绪，所差的只不过是创造发动侵略所需要的外交条件。凝固汽油弹、火焰喷射器和载有原子弹的飞机都已经准备好。因此，对在广岛和长崎扔过原子弹的那些人来说，在一个小小的加勒比海国家进行屠杀又有什么关系呢？
    “国民日报”在它发表的一篇社论中指出，“勒库布尔号”轮船是被这样一些人炸毁的，他们顽固地不允许古巴革命政府购买自卫用的武器。社论强调指出，任何人都不能否认飞机集中在美国佛罗里达的一些机场上是为了进攻古巴。
    在谈到美国在制造“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件的下一步侵略阴谋时，“战斗报”发表的一篇社论指出，合众国际社这个与华尔街有血肉联系的阴谋帮凶做了回答。它5日的一条消息夸耀美国在推翻危地马拉民主政府中的作用，危地马拉民主政府是在它自卫用的武器运到国内两天后被推翻的。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴“革命报”再次指出，制造爆炸“勒库布尔号”事件的，就是那些毫不迟疑地在广岛和长崎扔原子弹的家伙。
    在帝国主义者毒手下死难的人的尸体不断被发现，令人不忍卒睹的情景激起古巴人民对帝国主义者的日益强烈的仇恨。在哈瓦那港，由于船只驶出搅动了港湾中的海水，残缺不全的死难者的尸体继续浮出水面。一个古巴男孩找到了他的父亲的脚，因为他认出了脚上刺的花纹。
    一位义愤填膺的母亲在她的儿子的遗体面前，哭着责问制造这次罪行的帝国主义者：为什么杀害了我的儿子，他的小孩子还需要他的照管。
    哈瓦那报纸继续刊登失踪者的像片和他们的家属的绝望的寻人启事。古巴的海上警察继续在寻找死难者的遗体，并且时有发现。卫生部革命队的一千多名队员仍在哈瓦那港口的瓦砾中工作。出事地区弥漫着的强烈臭气表明，在碎石堆下还埋着被帝国主义者杀害的古巴死难者。
