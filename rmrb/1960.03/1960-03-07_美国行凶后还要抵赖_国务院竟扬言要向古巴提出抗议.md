Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Washington Dispatch: The U.S. State Department, through a statement issued by one of its officials, Francis Tally, on the 5th, denied any connection between the United States and the "La Coubre" ship explosion in Havana Harbor, Cuba, and again threatened Cuba, declaring that it would "immediately through diplomatic channels" express the U.S. government's "strong protest" to Cuba.

Prime Minister Castro, in his speech at the funeral for the victims of the explosion on the 5th, revealed that U.S. officials had prevented Cuba from purchasing weapons from Belgium, and pointed out that the culprits behind this sabotage should be sought among U.S. government officials.

Earlier, the U.S. State Department had issued a hypocritical statement on the 5th, feigning "deep sorrow" over the explosion and expressing that it "shared the grief and shock that this disaster brought to the Cuban people." However, the Associated Press, in commenting on this statement by the U.S. State Department, pointed out the fact that this provocative statement by the U.S. State Department expressed its hostility towards the Cuban revolutionary government. It said, "Under normal circumstances, such a cable (referring to the statement expressing 'condolences' – editor) would have been addressed by the government and people to the government and people"; but "the State Department's formal statement deliberately omitted any mention of the Cuban government," "reflecting the strained relations between the United States and Cuba's Castro regime," and "indicating that (the United States) does not like the government itself."

While the U.S. government threatened to issue a "protest" to Cuba, U.S. politicians and newspapers once again issued calls against the Cuban government. U.S. Congressman Cunningham issued a statement on the 5th, threatening the Cuban government to "immediately release" the American Chapman, who was arrested in connection with the explosion, and blatantly clamoring that the United States "has already let Castro go unpunished for too long." Another Congressman, Porter, attacked the Cuban "Revolution Newspaper" for revealing the United States' involvement in the "La Coubre" explosion as "ridiculous and hysterical." The "New York Times" also published an editorial on the 5th, attacking Prime Minister Castro and the Cuban "Revolution Newspaper," and shouting that the United States "felt extremely indignant" at Cuba's legitimate accusations.

### 美国行凶后还要抵赖  国务院竟扬言要向古巴提出抗议

    美国行凶后还要抵赖
    国务院竟扬言要向古巴提出抗议
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院在5日由它的一名官员弗朗西斯·塔利发表声明，抵赖美国同在古巴哈瓦那港口发生的“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件的关联，并且再次威胁古巴，扬言要“立即通过外交途径”向古巴表示美国政府的“强有力的抗议”。
    卡斯特罗总理5日在为这次爆炸事件中死难者举行的葬礼中讲话时，曾经揭露美国官员阻止古巴向比利时购买武器的交易，并且指出，应该从美国政府的官员中寻找进行这次破坏活动的祸首。
  早些时候，美国国务院曾经在5日发表一篇伪善的声明，假惺惺地表示对这次爆炸事件“深为难过”，并且表示“分担这次灾难给古巴人带来的悲哀和震惊”。但是，美联社在评论美国国务院的这项声明时指出了这个事实：美国国务院这项挑拨性声明，表示了它对古巴革命政府的敌意。它说，“在正常的情况下，这样一封电报（指表示“慰问”的声明——编者）本来是要由政府和人民致达政府和人民的”；而“国务院的正式声明却有意略而不提任何古巴政府”，“是反映了美国同古巴的卡斯特罗政权之间的紧张关系”，“是表明（美国）对政府本身并不喜欢”。
    在美国政府扬言要向古巴提出“抗议”的同时，美国政界人士和报纸再次发出反对古巴政府的叫嚣。美国众议员肯宁安5日发表声明，威胁古巴政府“立即释放”被它逮捕的与爆炸案有关的美国人查普曼，并且公然叫嚷美国“早已经让卡斯特罗不受惩罚得太过分了”。另一名众议员波特尔攻击古巴“革命报”揭露美国同“勒库布尔号”爆炸事件有关的报道是“荒唐可笑和歇斯地里的”。“纽约时报”也在5日发表的一篇社论中攻击卡斯特罗总理和古巴“革命报”，并且大叫美国对古巴的正当指责“感到极其愤懑”。
