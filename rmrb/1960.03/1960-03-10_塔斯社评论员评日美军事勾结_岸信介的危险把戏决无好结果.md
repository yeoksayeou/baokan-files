Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: TASS published a commentary on March 8th by commentator Kharikov, stating that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government is hastily accelerating the ratification of the US-Japan military treaty in the Diet. During the Diet debates, the actions of Kishi Nobusuke and his colleagues have reached a level of blatant recklessness. In Japan, the masses are protesting daily against the military collusion between Japan and the United States. It is worth noting that even within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, powerful groups led by Ishibashi, Miki, and Kono are calling on the Diet to consider the strong dissatisfaction of the Japanese and foreign public with the US-Japan military agreement, and to treat this agreement with a critical attitude.

The commentary pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke has even raised territorial claims to the Soviet Union's Kuril Islands. This behavior can only be seen as a blatant manifestation of revanchist tendencies, which will absolutely not help improve Soviet-Japanese relations or the cause of peace in the Far East. It can only be seen as an attempt to revise international agreements, which the Kishi Nobusuke government has no right to do at all.

The commentary stated that as for the Soviet Union, its rights to the Kuril Islands, especially Kunashir and Etorofu Islands, are indisputable. There is no need to conduct historical research; we only need to cite important international documents such as the Crimean Agreement. In this agreement signed by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on February 11, 1945, the return of the Kuril Islands, southern Sakhalin, and their adjacent territories to the Soviet Union was clearly and definitively resolved.

The TASS commentator then emphasized that while the Kishi Nobusuke government is making absurd territorial claims to the Kuril Islands, it is completely indifferent to the fate of Japanese territories such as Okinawa. Although the war has ended fifteen years ago, these territories are still separated from Japan and have essentially become American territories and US military bases aimed at Japan's neighbors. No international agreement stipulates the separation of these islands from Japan, but the Kishi Nobusuke government remains silent on this issue, disregarding the oppression of its compatriots by foreign occupiers. This behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke government once again shows that it has sacrificed national interests and is serving American plans by signing a military agreement with the United States.

The commentator concluded by saying that as for the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempts to revise international agreements and its shameless territorial claims to the Soviet Union, such dangerous tricks will not have any good results.

### 塔斯社评论员评日美军事勾结  岸信介的危险把戏决无好结果

    塔斯社评论员评日美军事勾结
    岸信介的危险把戏决无好结果
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社8日发表评论员哈里科夫的一篇评论说，日本岸信介政府正匆忙地加速在国会批准日美军事条约，在国会辩论的过程中，岸信介及其同僚的行径简直达到了肆无忌惮的地步。在日本，群众每天都在反对日本同美国的军事勾结。值得注意的是，甚至在执政的自由民主党内部，以石桥、三木、河野为首的有势力集团也呼吁国会考虑日本国内外公众对日美军事协定的强烈不满，呼吁它以批判的态度对待这个协定。
    评论指出，岸信介居然对属于苏联的千岛群岛提出了领土要求。这种行径只能被认为是复仇主义倾向的露骨的表现，这绝对无助于改善日苏关系，无助于远东的和平事业。这只能被认为是企图修改国际协定，而这一点，岸信介政府是根本没有权利的。
    评论说，至于苏联，它对千岛群岛、特别是对国后岛和择捉岛的权利是无可争论的。不必进行历史研究，我们只援引像克里米亚协定这样的重要国际文件就够了。在美、英、苏三国于1945年2月11日签署的这个协定中，十分明确肯定地解决了把千岛群岛、库页岛南部及其毗连领土归还苏联的问题。
    塔斯社评论员接着强调说，岸信介政府一方面对千岛群岛提出了荒诞的领土要求，另一方面却对冲绳岛等等日本领土的命运完全漠不关心。虽然战争已经结束十五年了，但是这些领土仍然同日本分割着，并且实质上成了美国的领地，成了矛头指向日本邻国的美国军事基地。任何国际协议也没有规定把这些岛屿同日本割裂开，可是岸信介政府却不顾他的同胞遭受外国占领者的压迫，对这个问题缄默不言。岸信介政府的这种行径再一次表明，它由于同美国签定了军事协定，丧失了民族利益，而为美国的计划效力。
    评论员最后说，至于说到岸信介政府想修改国际协定的企图和向苏联提出无耻的领土要求，那么这种危险的把戏不会有任何好的结果。
