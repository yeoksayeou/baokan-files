Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant

    This newspaper reports that the Liulihe Cement Plant in Beijing has learned from the experience of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, in adjusting worker dormitories. Combining this with the plant's specific situation, and relying on the masses, they have adjusted worker dormitories to make living arrangements more rational, greatly benefiting production.
    Before adjusting the dormitories, the plant's Party committee conducted thorough ideological mobilization among the workers and established a dormitory adjustment committee. After conducting a "three-check" (check population, check housing area, check furniture), they proposed a rational distribution plan, which was discussed and approved by the workers' representative assembly before implementation.
    The specific practices of this plant in adjusting dormitories are: dividing dormitory areas according to workshops (single workers also live together in separate rooms within the family dormitory area), and allocating housing based on work sections and shifts. Each larger workshop's dormitory area has its own canteen and club. The management of dormitories, except for housing repairs and allocation, which are managed by the plant's administrative section, is handled by the workshops. Under the unified leadership of the Party branch, the trade union is responsible for organizing activities, the Communist Youth League is responsible for clubs and recreational activities, and the family committee is responsible for hygiene and organizing mutual aid, mediating disputes, and other tasks.
    After the adjustment of worker dormitories, leading cadres eat, live, work, and enjoy entertainment together with the workers, which facilitates comprehensive care for people, and ensures that production, life, and education are all addressed together. Because dormitory areas are divided by workshop, neighbors know each other well and have close relationships, and the spirit of mutual assistance and love is greatly promoted. Workers live in concentrated areas, which facilitates the organization of meetings and social and cultural activities. Thus, the dormitory area has become an important base for promoting production, organizing life, and strengthening political and cultural education. In addition, due to the rational adjustment of dormitories, the potential of housing has been tapped, allowing the plant to accommodate another two hundred and five households of workers who originally lived outside the plant without increasing the number of houses. At the same time, one thousand square meters of housing area was freed up to set up workshop canteens and clubs.

Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine

    This newspaper reports that the Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhaogezhuang Mine has adjusted the collective dormitories for new workers according to workshop and shift, achieving a triple harvest in production, life, and education.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, this mine has continuously added a large number of new workers. Due to the shortage of dormitories, the mine adopted the method of arranging accommodation for each batch as they arrived, resulting in the situation that new workers from the same workshop were scattered in seven dormitory areas, in dozens or even hundreds of rooms. It was difficult for workshop cadres to effectively educate the new workers. New workers on different shifts lived in the same room, some coming and others going, some sleeping while others talked, which interfered with each other's rest. Poor rest also affected production.
    After the new worker dormitories were adjusted according to workshop and shift, five improvements were achieved: First, political and ideological education improved. After the dormitory adjustment, the workshop strengthened its leadership over the dormitory, promptly grasped the ideological situation of the new workers, and was able to conduct education in a timely manner, which played a significant role in improving the workers' political consciousness and establishing communist moral qualities. Second, workers' rest improved. After living according to shifts, the new workers' daily routines and work schedules were consistent, ensuring that everyone had sufficient sleep and rest time. Third, attendance rate increased, and safe production improved. Due to the strengthening of communist education and the workers getting good rest, absenteeism was greatly reduced. For example, before the adjustment of the Seventh and Third District dormitory, the attendance rate of new workers was only 70%, but after the adjustment, it reached 100%. The workers' spirits were also more full during production. Fourth, cultural and sports activities were well developed. The dormitories were filled with songs, the sound of reading, and laughter. The workers happily said: "There are good mentors at work, and good dormitories after work, these are the two most satisfying things." Fifth, hygiene improved. After the dormitory adjustment, mass hygiene competitions were launched. The new workers consciously maintained regular environmental and personal hygiene, quickly eliminated the "four pests," and achieved environmental beautification and indoor cleanliness.

### 调整宿舍三丰收  职工生活得更好　政治文化学习　加强生产劲头更足

    调整宿舍三丰收
    职工生活得更好　政治文化学习　加强生产劲头更足
    北京琉璃河水泥厂
    本报讯　北京市琉璃河水泥厂学习山西省阳泉市调整职工宿舍的经验，结合本厂具体情况，依靠群众调整了职工宿舍，使居住情况更加合理，大大有利于生产。
    在调整宿舍之前，厂党委在职工中进行了充分的思想动员，并且成立了调整宿舍委员会经过“三查”（查人口、查住房面积、查家具），提出合理的分配方案，经职工代表大会讨论通过后实行。
    这个厂调整宿舍的具体做法是：按车间划分宿舍区（单身职工也在家属宿舍另辟房间集中居住），根据工段、班次分配房屋。各较大车间的宿舍区都办了食堂和俱乐部。宿舍的管理工作，除房屋修缮、分配等由工厂行政科负责管理外，其余都交给车间管理。在党支部的统一领导下，工会负责组织生活，共青团负责俱乐部和文娱活动，家属委员会负责卫生和组织互助、调解纠纷等工作。
    职工宿舍调整以后，领导干部与职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同娱乐，便于全面关心人，做到了对生产、生活、教育一起抓；由于按车间划分宿舍区，左邻右舍彼此了解，来往亲密，互助友爱的风气大大发扬；职工居住集中，便于组织会议和开展社会、文化活动。这样就使宿舍区成了推动生产、组织生活和加强政治、文化教育等工作的重要基地之一。另外，由于合理调整了宿舍，挖掘了房屋的潜力，使这个厂在不增加房屋的情况下，又多容纳了原来住在厂外的二百零五户职工，同时腾出一千平方米面积的房屋办了车间食堂和俱乐部。
    开滦赵各庄矿
    本报讯　开滦煤矿赵各庄矿按车间、班次调整新工人集体宿舍，作到了生产、生活、教育三丰收。
    大跃进以来，这个矿陆续增加了不少新工人。由于宿舍少，矿上采取的办法是来一批安置一批，结果出现了这样的情况：同一车间的新工人分散住在七个宿舍区，几十个甚至几百房间里。车间干部不容易对新工人很好地进行教育。不同班次的新工人居住在一个房间，你来我走，你睡觉他谈天，互相妨碍休息。由于休息不好，也影响生产。
    新工人宿舍按车间、班次调整以后，作到了五好：一、政治思想教育好。调整宿舍后，车间加强了对宿舍的领导，及时掌握了新工人的思想情况，能及时进行教育，对提高职工政治思想觉悟、树立共产主义道德品质起了很大作用。二、职工休息好。按班次居住以后，新工人起居上班，行动一致，保证了每个人都有充分的睡眠和休息时间。三、出勤率高，安全生产好。由于加强了共产主义教育，职工休息得好，缺勤现象大大减少。如七三区宿舍调整以前，新工人出勤率只达到70％，调整后达到百分之百。职工们在生产中精神也更饱满。四、文娱体育活动开展好。宿舍里到处是歌声、读书声、欢笑声。工人们高兴地说：“上班有好师傅，下班有好宿舍，是两件最称心的事。”五、卫生好。调整宿舍后，开展了群众性的卫生竞赛，新工人们自觉地保持了经常性的环境卫生和个人卫生，迅速消灭了“四害”，实现了环境美化，室内整洁化。
