Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 11th: According to today's "Mainichi Shimbun" report, Kenzo Matsumura, one of the leaders of the non-mainstream faction of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, told the newspaper's reporters yesterday that forcibly ratifying the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" under the current circumstances would make it impossible to improve Sino-Japanese relations. He advocated that the new "Security Treaty" must be fully discussed and that there is no need to rush its ratification.

Matsumura expressed his opposition to Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's "unified interpretation" expressed at the Diet meeting on February 26 regarding the scope of the new "Security Treaty" applying to the "Far East" including China, Korea, and a part of Soviet territory. Matsumura pointed out that this interpretation means that "Japan and the United States have great concern about disputes in Korea and Taiwan," which makes people suspect that it hides the ideas of the former Japan-Germany-Italy alliance and the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Matsumura said that according to this treaty, Japan will be dragged into American military operations in the event of disputes in Korea, Taiwan, and Jinmen and Matsu Islands. He said that after the conclusion of the new "Security Treaty," the significance of Japan providing bases to the US military has fundamentally changed, and Japan will inevitably bear "joint responsibility" with the United States.

Matsumura also pointed out that the so-called "prior consultation" in the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" is also unreliable. He said he hopes to take action on this matter together with former Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi.

    松村谦三说如批准日美条约
    日中关系将不能改善
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：据“每日新闻”今天报道，日本自由民主党非当权派领袖之一的松村谦三昨天对这家报纸的记者说，在目前情况下强行批准新日美“安全条约”，就不可能改善日中关系。他主张必须充分讨论新“安全条约”，不必急于批准。
    松村表示反对岸信介首相2月26日在国会会议上发表的关于新“安全条约”适用于“远东”的范围包括中国、朝鲜和苏联一部分领土的“统一解释”。松村指出，这种解释意味着“在朝鲜和台湾发生纷争时，日美两国对此持有很大的关心”，这会使人怀疑，在这里面隐藏着当年日、德、意三国同盟和“大东亚共荣圈”的想法。
    松村说，根据这项条约，在朝鲜、台湾和金门、马祖岛发生纷争时，日本将被卷入美国的军事行动。他说，在缔结新“安全条约”后，日本提供基地给美军这件事的意义已从根本上起了变化，日本必将同美国承担“共同责任”。
    松村还指出，新日美“安全条约”中的所谓“事先协商”也是不可靠的。他表示他希望同前首相石桥湛山一起在这件事上展开行动。
