(By our newspaper) The CCP Hebei Provincial Committee convened a five-level cadre meeting from February 10th to 14th. The meeting summarized the experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1959, deployed the province's tasks for this year, and called on Party organizations and the vast number of Party members, cadres, and the masses throughout the province to hold high the banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, continue to advance, strive for the best, and strive for first place, to resolutely realize this year's continued leap forward plan.

The meeting was presided over by Comrade Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Comrade Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a report on the current situation and the work tasks of Hebei Province in 1960.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the current situation in Hebei Province is extremely good. In terms of economic construction, after two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, all aspects have experienced high-speed leaps and development. In 1959, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 40.3% on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Hebei Province's industry has laid the foundation for the technical transformation of the entire national economy. The continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production for two consecutive years has basically achieved grain self-sufficiency throughout the province, which is a huge achievement of historical significance. From then on, agricultural production in Hebei Province began to enter a new stage of stable and high yield. This year, whether from the "open door red," "monthly red," and "daily red" achievements of industry, or from the spring plowing preparations in the rural areas, the growth of wheat, and the overall situation of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, everything is better than in previous years, and represents a new situation of continued leap forward.

Under this excellent situation, the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee put forward the general task for 1960, which is to better implement the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results; to better implement the Party's fundamental policy of developing both industry and agriculture simultaneously; and to strive for a continued leap forward in the national economy on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. In order to achieve this task, the arrangement of the 1960 national economic plan should implement the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation, giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and combining it with the rapid development of agriculture, so as to better handle the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. On the agricultural front, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of taking grain as the key, combining grain and livestock, combining grain and cash crops, and achieving comprehensive and high-speed development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. On the industrial front, continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key, giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and comprehensively leaping forward. On the financial and trade front, we must proceed from production and promote the high-speed development of the national economy through exchange and distribution, so as to better guarantee the needs of the people's lives. On the cultural and educational front, continue to implement the policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, closely cooperate with economic construction, launch an even larger-scale cultural revolution upsurge, vigorously run technical education, vigorously run spare-time education, vigorously run normal education, and rapidly improve the political, scientific, and cultural level of the workers and peasants, and cultivate a strong scientific and technological force and a theoretical force that is both red and expert.

The meeting believed that it is necessary to launch a campaign to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong on all fronts, establish the idea of building socialism at high speed, oppose various right-leaning sentiments that attempt to delay the speed of construction and stagnate, and various violations of the General Line, and establish the idea of unifying the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development. Enable the revolution to advance from one stage to another and from one victory to another without missing the opportunity.

The meeting believed that in order to successfully realize the great tasks of 1960, it is necessary to launch a mass movement to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. In agricultural production, accelerate agricultural technical reform and strive to change the face of agriculture in Hebei Province as soon as possible. To this end, it is necessary to focus on the following aspects: First, accelerate the realization of agricultural water conservancy. While concentrating efforts on completing the six major reservoir projects, it is also necessary to vigorously build medium-sized and small reservoirs, and continue to develop farmland water conservancy and soil and water conservation projects. Expand the irrigated area by 10 million mu. Second, accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, vigorously carry out the tool reform movement, implement the simultaneous development of mechanization and semi-mechanization, and widely promote effective new-style and improved farm tools, increasing the area of mechanized farming by more than 10%. Third, vigorously develop pig raising and manure accumulation and actively develop chemical fertilizers, realizing an average of one pig per person in rural areas. In order to increase chemical fertilizers, while actively establishing large, medium, and small foreign chemical fertilizer plants, mobilize the masses to vigorously produce indigenous chemical fertilizers. Fourth, gradually realize electrification. At the current stage, the main task is to mobilize the masses to build power stations according to local conditions. In industrial production, the focus should be on vigorously developing semi-mechanization and mechanization, and where conditions permit, development should be in the direction of automation and semi-automation.

In order to achieve the overall tasks of 1960, it is necessary to focus on the following specific tasks at present: In rural areas, we must extensively carry out the large-scale high-yield movement of achieving 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. Further strengthen animal husbandry production, and pig production must be guaranteed to increase month by month to achieve the plan of one pig per person in the province's rural population; attach great importance to the development of large livestock, focus on spring mating, focus on epidemic prevention, and ensure the continued leap forward in large livestock production this year. The arrangement and overall handling of spring afforestation, fishing season production, and vegetable production should also be properly arranged and handled. The season for spring plowing production has arrived. "An inch of spring is worth an ounce of gold." The whole Party and the whole people should immediately mobilize and rapidly launch a vigorous upsurge of spring plowing production throughout the province. Launch a spring plowing and sowing campaign centered on drought prevention and resistance. Resolutely overcome the spring drought and ensure timely sowing. Check the wheat fields plot by plot, manage them according to category, attack water and attack fertilizer to win a great harvest of summer crops. In industrial production, it is currently necessary to focus on two issues: First, the production plans for steel and coal must be completed on a daily and ten-day basis. All localities must conscientiously grasp the organization of increased production and conservation of steel, iron, and coal, using coal to ensure steel, and rapidly improve production; Second, industry must vigorously support agriculture. Spring sowing is about to begin, so we must strive to seize the time to speed up the production of agricultural machinery and ensure timely, high-quality, and high-quantity supply. Secondly, we must conscientiously grasp the manufacture, repair, and matching of semi-mechanized farm tools and small farm tools. Organize technical forces to provide technical support to the People's Communes.

    中共河北省委召开五级干部会议部署今年任务
    乘大好形势　争生产上游
    本报讯　中共河北省委于2月10日至14日召开了五级干部会议。会议总结了1959年大跃进的经验，部署了今年全省各项任务，号召全省各级党组织和广大党员干部、群众，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，继续前进，力争上游，力争第一，为坚决实现今年的继续跃进计划而奋斗。
    会议由省委第一书记林铁同志主持，由省委书记处书记刘子厚同志作了当前形势和河北省1960年工作任务的报告。
    会议一致认为：河北省当前形势极好。在经济建设方面，经过两年的连续大跃进，各方面都有着高速度的飞跃发展，1959年全省工农业总产值，在1958年大跃进的基础上，增长了40．3％。河北省的工业已经为整个国民经济的技术改造奠定了基础。农业生产连续两年的大跃进，全省已基本上实现了粮食自给，这是一个有历史意义的巨大成就。从此，河北省的农业生产开始进入了一个稳定高产的新阶段。今年，无论从工业实现开门红、月月红、日日红方面，还是从农村春耕准备、小麦生长情况和整个农林牧副渔的情况来看，都比往年更好，都是继续跃进的新形势。
    在这种大好形势下，中共河北省委提出了1960年总的斗争任务，就是更好地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地贯彻执行党的总路线，更好地贯彻执行党的发展工业和发展农业同时并举的根本方针，在1959年大跃进的基础上，争取国民经济的继续跃进。为实现这个任务，1960年国民经济计划的安排，应当贯彻以农业为基础，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的原则，更好地处理农业、轻工业、重工业各部门之间的关系。在农业战线上，要认真贯彻以粮为纲、粮畜并举、粮食与经济作物并举，农林牧副渔全面高速度发展的方针；在工业战线上，继续贯彻执行以钢为纲，优先发展重工业，全面跃进的方针；在财贸战线上，必须从生产出发，通过交换和分配，促进国民经济的高速度发展，更好地保证人民生活的需要；在文化教育战线上，继续贯彻为无产阶级政治服务和教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，紧密配合经济建设，掀起一个更大规模的文化革命高潮，大办技术教育，大办业余教育，大办师范教育，迅速提高工农群众的政治、科学、文化水平，培养出一支强大的又红又专的科学技术队伍和理论队伍。
    会议认为要在各个战线上开展学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作。树立高速度建设社会主义的思想，反对在建设上企图延缓速度、停滞不前等各种违背总路线的右倾情绪，树立不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相统一的思想。使革命不失时机地从一个阶段前进到另一个阶段，从一个胜利前进到另一个胜利。
    会议认为，要胜利实现1960年的伟大任务，必须掀起一个大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。在农业生产上，加紧农业技术改革，力争尽快地改变河北省的农业面貌。为此要突出地抓住以下几个方面：一、加速实现农业的水利化。在集中力量完成六大水库工程的同时，还要大力修建中、小型水库，继续发展农田水利和水土保持等工程。扩大灌溉面积一千万亩。二、加速实现农业机械化，大搞工具改革运动，实行机械化同半机械化同时并举，广泛地推广行之有效的新式农具和改良农具，增加机耕面积10％以上。三、大搞养猪积肥和积极发展化肥，实现农村人口每人平均一口猪。为了增加化肥，在积极兴办大、中、小型洋化肥厂的同时，发动群众大搞土化肥。四、逐步实现电气化，在当前阶段，主要是发动群众因地制宜地办电。在工业生产上，要以大搞半机械化、机械化为中心，有条件的要向自动化、半自动化方向发展。
    为了实现1960年的总任务，当前要突出抓紧以下几个方面的具体任务：在农村，要广泛开展千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯的大面积丰产运动。进一步加强畜牧生产，养猪生产要保证月月上升，实现全省农村人口一人一猪的计划；高度重视大牲畜的发展，大抓春配，大抓防疫，保证今年大牲畜生产持续跃进。对春季造林、渔汛生产以及蔬菜生产等等，也要统筹安排，全面搞好。当前春耕生产的季节已经到来了，“春光一刻值千金”，全党全民应该立即动员起来，迅速在全省掀起一个声势浩大的春耕生产高潮。开展以防旱抗旱为中心的春耕播种运动。坚决战胜春旱，保证适时播种。对麦田要逐块检查，分类管理，攻水攻肥，夺取夏收作物大丰收。在工业生产上，当前要突出地抓两个问题，第一，一定要按日按旬完成钢铁、煤炭的生产计划。各地必须切实抓紧组织钢、铁、煤炭的增产和节约，以煤保钢，生产迅速提高；第二，工业要大力支援农业，春播即将开始，对农业机械要争取时间抓紧生产，保证按时、按质、按量的供应。其次，对半机械化农具、小农具的制造、修配要切实抓紧。组织技术力量；给人民公社以技术支援。
