    I Conquered Illiteracy Mountain
    Wang Lingyun, Liancun People's Commune, Ye County, Henan

    Before liberation, I couldn't read a single character. Now, with four children, I've entered a part-time middle school. Thinking about this, I truly have no words to express my gratitude to the Party.

    I am thirty-eight years old this year, from a poor peasant background. Before liberation, I couldn't keep myself warm or have enough to eat. I suffered countless hardships and oppressions. After liberation, I was emancipated. However, I was still illiterate. After the land reform, I used the land certificate I was given as scrap paper to cut shoe patterns, which frightened me so much that I didn't dare to go home for several days. From that time on, I resolved to learn to read and write.

    In the winter of 1950, I joined the literacy class. Something I never dreamed of actually came true, and I was so happy that I hummed tunes while walking. The neighbors gossiped, saying: "Someone in their fifties! Still going to school with a bunch of kids!" Even my mother-in-law made sarcastic remarks. At the time, I wasn't intimidated by other people's ridicule. I thought: with the Communist Party and Chairman Mao standing up for me, telling me to go to school, what am I afraid of? So I just kept studying hard.

    Secretary Zhao of our village has always been very supportive of my studies. Once, the county notified him to attend a literacy meeting. Unfortunately, his child died, and someone from his family came to call him back. He said: "My child's death is my personal matter, and I can skip that. The literacy meeting is related to the cultural emancipation of hundreds of commune members in the village, and I can't delay it." This incident deeply moved me. The Party cares so much about the cultural learning of the commune members, how can I not work harder? I said to Secretary Zhao: "If I don't conquer Illiteracy Mountain, I will be letting the Party down."

    Through continuous learning, I have not only improved my cultural level, but also understood many revolutionary principles. I often think: Communism is like heaven, but how can you get there without culture? Thinking of this further strengthened my confidence in learning. For ten years, I have not interrupted my studies for a single day.

    Every day, I get up before dawn and work until dusk, taking care of the family's food, clothing, and needs properly, so as to avoid any complaints from my family. The diapers and dirty clothes that the children soiled were always taken to the pond to wash before dawn, for fear of affecting production and learning. Over the years, I have not slept a full night. I remember one snowy night, I was reviewing algebra when the lamp set my headscarf on fire. I didn't realize it until my hair started to burn. Every night, I put the two older children to sleep and then carried the youngest one to night school. Once, my child was sick, and I was also sick, but I still carried the child to class. For ten years, I have never put down my cultural bag. I read whenever I have time. Now I have completed the main courses of junior high school and read 125 extracurricular books. I can read novels such as "Liu Hulan," "Zhao Yiman," and stories about Mr. Lu Xun, "My Family," and other books. After reading these books, my writing ability and simple grammar knowledge have improved. Now I can write clapper talk, rhyming verses, and general articles. (Attached picture)

    我攻倒了文盲山
    河南叶县廉村人民公社　王凌云
    解放前，我一个大字不识。现在，有了四个孩子，却进了业余中学。想起这件事，我对党真有说不出的感激。
    我今年三十八岁，贫农成份，解放前，衣不保暖，饭不糊口。不知受了多少熬煎和压迫。解放后，翻了身。可是，仍然目不识丁。土改后，我把分到的土地证当成废纸剪鞋样子了，吓的我几天不敢回家。从那时起，我决心学文化。
    1950年冬天，我进了扫盲班。做梦也没想到的事，居然实现了，我高兴得走路都哼着小曲。邻居风言风语地说：几十岁的人啦！一群孩子，还上学！就连婆婆也扳着脸说怪话。当时，我没有被别人的讥笑吓倒，我想：有共产党和毛主席给我作主，叫我上学，我还怕啥。就一个劲的去学习。
    俺村赵支书，平时对我学习就很支持。一次，县里通知他去开扫盲会议，不幸，他的孩子死了，家里来人叫他回去。他说：孩子死了是我个人的事，可以不去。扫盲会议关系全村几百名社员文化翻身，我不能耽搁。这件事深深地感动了我。党这样关心社员的文化学习，我怎能不加油干呢？我给赵支书说：“攻不倒文盲山，我对不起党。”
    经过不断的学习，我不光提高了文化水平，还懂得了不少革命道理，我常想：共产主义像天堂一样，可是没有文化怎能上呢？想到这里，更增加了我学文化的信心。十年来，我没有一天间断过学习。
    每天都是起五更打黄昏，把全家吃的穿的弄的妥妥贴贴。免得家人对我有意见。孩子屙的尿布和脏衣服，总是天不亮拿到塘边去洗，怕影响生产和学习。几年来，我没有睡过整夜觉。记得在一个雪夜里，我正复习代数，灯火烧着了我的头巾，直到烧着头发时我才感觉到。每天晚上，我把较大的两个孩子哄睡了，抱着小的去夜校学习。有一次孩子病了，我也病了，还是抱着孩子去上课。十年来，我身边没有放下过文化袋。有空就读书。现在已经读完了初中的主要课程，并阅读课外书籍一百二十五册，能看“刘胡兰”、“赵一曼”等小说和关于鲁迅先生的故事、“我的一家”等书。看了这些书籍以后，增长了我的写作能力和简单的语法知识。现在我已经能写快板、顺口溜和一般文章了。（附图片）
