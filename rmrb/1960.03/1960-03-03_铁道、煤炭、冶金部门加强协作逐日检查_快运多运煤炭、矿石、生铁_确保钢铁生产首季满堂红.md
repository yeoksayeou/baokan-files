Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The national railway transport departments are taking various measures to strengthen the transportation of materials such as coal, ore, and pig iron, to ensure the continued leap forward of the steel industry.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, the national average daily loading of coal in February increased by nearly 300 railcars compared to January, and metal ore increased by more than 250 railcars. The continuous strengthening of transportation work has resulted in Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company currently receiving a relatively sufficient supply of the ore they need, and having reserves of a certain amount of ore. The reserves of metallurgical coal for iron and steel enterprises in Baotou, Benxi, Wuhan, Beijing, and other places have also recently begun to increase.

To meet the needs of the continued leap forward of China's steel industry, the transportation volume of metallurgical raw materials such as coal, ore, and pig iron has increased significantly this year. To do a good job in the transportation of these materials, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry established a daily reporting system starting in mid-February. They check daily the completion of the national key iron and steel enterprises and key coal mines' daily plans for coal loading, coal transportation, coal unloading, and coal inventory. Stations in the location of the key iron and steel enterprises and coal mines also check four times a day. When problems are discovered, they are immediately submitted to the joint office composed of these departments for timely resolution. For the ore transportation and supply situation of some key iron and steel enterprises that rely on supplies from other places, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have also adopted a method of daily reporting and daily inspection. After the establishment of the daily reporting system, the transportation organization of coal, ore, and other materials has become more detailed.

While strengthening transportation organization, key coal mines and steel plants have vigorously launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization to improve loading and unloading efficiency within the mines and plants. According to incomplete statistics, eight coal mines including Fengfeng, Jingxing, Fushun, Hegang, and Shuangyashan, are building coal loading and storage facilities near the mine area stations. Within March, eight landslide platforms and more than 30 coal storage warehouses will begin to be used. These facilities will greatly shorten the coal loading time. Under the leadership of the municipal party committee, the relevant units in Hegang City established three groups to focus on short-distance transportation in the coal mine area, building coal storage warehouses, and improving loading and transportation equipment. The city plans to build 25 large, medium, and small coal bunkers at coal loading locations in the mine area to achieve "production can continue for three days without a train, and loading can continue for three days without production." Hegang Coal Mine and Hegang Station also established a road and mine transportation technical team to organize the overall planning and transformation of road and mine transportation equipment, improve the connection of train operations between the two parties, and accelerate vehicle turnover.

The Ministry of Railways recently specially inspected the coal transportation work of the eight railway bureaus in the main coal-producing areas, and instructed the railway bureaus to resolutely implement the transportation policy of "taking coal transportation as the key link" formulated by the Ministry of Railways. In vehicle dispatch, priority should be given to ensuring the needs of coal transportation, so that the railways transport as much as the coal mines produce. At the same time, in places where conditions permit, the original coal stored in the mining area should be transported out. The Hengshan Mine of Jixi Mining Bureau is preparing to take the method of "moving the railway line" to move temporarily idle and unused railway lines to the place where the coal is stored, so that some of the coal that has been stored for a long time can be transported out.

### 铁道、煤炭、冶金部门加强协作逐日检查  快运多运煤炭、矿石、生铁  确保钢铁生产首季满堂红

    铁道、煤炭、冶金部门加强协作逐日检查
    快运多运煤炭、矿石、生铁
    确保钢铁生产首季满堂红
    新华社2日讯　全国铁路运输部门采取各种措施，加强煤炭、矿石、生铁等物资的运输，保证钢铁工业继续跃进。
    据铁道部统计，2月份全国每天平均装运的煤炭，比1月份增加将近三百车，金属矿石增加二百五十多车。运输工作的不断加强，使得鞍山钢铁公司、石景山钢铁公司和太原钢铁公司目前需要的矿石得到较充分的供应，而且储备了一定数量的矿石。包头、本溪、武汉、北京等地钢铁企业冶金用煤的储备量，最近也开始有所增加。
    适应我国钢铁工业继续跃进的需要，今年煤炭、矿石、生铁等冶金原料的运输量显著增加。为了做好这些物资的运输工作，铁道部、煤炭工业部和冶金工业部从2月中旬起建立了日报制度，逐日检查全国各重点钢铁企业、重点煤矿每天装煤、运煤、卸煤和库存煤等计划完成的情况，各重点钢铁企业和煤矿所在地的车站还一日检查四次；发现问题后，立即交由这些部门组成的联合办公室及时解决。对于一些依靠外地供应矿石的重点钢铁企业矿石运输、供应情况，铁道部和冶金工业部也采取了逐日报告、逐日检查的办法。日报制度建立后，煤炭、矿石等物资的运输组织工作就更加细致了。
    在加强运输组织工作的同时，各重点煤矿和钢铁厂都轰轰烈烈地开展了以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，提高矿内、厂内的装卸效率。据不完全统计，峰峰、井陉、抚顺、鹤岗、双鸭山等十个煤矿，正在矿区车站附近建设的装煤、储煤设备，3月份内就可以有八座滑坡站台、三十多座储煤仓开始使用。这些设备将使煤炭的装车时间大大缩短。鹤岗市的有关单位在市委的领导下，成立了三个小组，抓煤矿区短途运输、修建储煤仓和改进装运设备的工作；全市计划在矿区装车地点修建二十五座大、中、小型煤仓，要做到“三天不来火车照样生产，三天不生产照样装车”。鹤岗煤矿和鹤岗车站还成立了路矿运输技术小组，组织路矿运输设备的总体规划和改造，改进双方火车运行的衔接工作，加速车辆周转。
    铁道部最近专门检查了主要煤炭产区的八个铁路局的煤炭运输工作，指示各铁路局坚决贯彻铁道部制定的“以煤运为纲”的运输方针，在车辆调度上首先保证运煤需要，做到煤矿生产多少，铁路运出多少。同时在有条件的地方，把矿区原来的存煤运出来。鸡西矿务局恒山矿就准备采取“线路搬家”的办法，把暂时闲置未用的铁路线迁移到存煤的地方，使一些存放已久的煤炭能运出来。
