Facing Production, Caring for the Masses
Chongqing Luoqisi Savings Office Provides Multi-faceted Services to Residents

(本报讯) The staff of the Luoqisi Savings Office of the Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China, Nanan District, have established the idea of serving production and the masses. They actively participate in organizing people's production and life and have achieved remarkable results.

This savings office is located in a large factory area. In 1959, according to the district committee's instructions on conscientiously organizing the people's economic life, under the leadership of the Party committee, they participated in the "People's Economic Life Organization Committee" composed of factories, streets, banks, shops and other departments. They actively cooperated with relevant departments, starting from caring for production and serving production, organizing workers' families to participate in production, developing collective welfare undertakings for residents, and serving production and residents' lives.

They found that after the factory's production had multiplied, the supply of certain auxiliary materials was insufficient, and auxiliary labor was also lacking. At the same time, some workers' families were very enthusiastic about participating in labor, but could not find a way to produce for a while. Therefore, they reported the situation to the street Party committee. Under the unified leadership of the street Party committee, they actively participated in organizing more than 2,000 workers' families to set up eight civilian-run factories, producing a large number of refractory materials and processing a large number of quartz, yellow sand, etc., to supply the needs of the factory. In addition, they also organized a short-distance transportation team to help the factory with transportation. These civilian-run factories and transportation teams have been consolidated and developed due to the savings office's active assistance in establishing accounting and settlement systems, training accounting personnel, etc., which has strongly supported the factory's production leap forward.

In order to solve the housework problems of workers' families after participating in labor, under the leadership of the street Party committee, the savings office staff cooperated with various departments to prepare for the construction of twelve civilian-run canteens, twelve civilian-run nurseries, and eight life service stations to handle more than 20 service items such as laundry and sewing.

In the process of participating in the organization of the people's economic life, this savings office constantly carries out propaganda activities for building the country and managing the household with diligence and thrift. On the basis of helping workers arrange their lives, they carry out savings business. For example, some young workers do not know how to arrange their lives, so the savings office staff vigorously publicizes the benefits of saving on the one hand, and goes deep into a Communist Youth League group to specifically help arrange their lives, and then promotes the experience in an all-round way. Now, more than 90% of the young workers in the factory regularly save.

Due to the active work of this savings office, it has become a strong assistant to the Party committee in organizing the people's economic life. The factory and street Party committees have paid more attention to the work of the bank and actively strengthened leadership, which has made the bank's own business unprecedentedly developed. Now, the factory has a savings committee, the workshop has a savings agency, and the canteen has a savings agent, making savings work a mass work. The amount of savings has greatly increased compared with the past.

    面向生产　关心群众
    重庆锣旗寺储蓄所多方面为居民服务
    本报讯　中国人民银行重庆市分行南岸区锣旗寺储蓄所职工，树立一切为生产服务、为群众服务的思想，积极参予组织人民的生产和生活，取得显著成绩。
    这个储蓄所设在一个大工厂区。1959年，他们根据区委关于认真组织好人民经济生活的指示，在党委领导下，参加了由工厂、街道、银行、商店等部门组成的“组织人民经济生活委员会”，积极协同有关部门从关心生产、服务生产出发，组织职工家属参加生产，发展居民集体福利事业，为生产和居民生活服务。
    他们发现工厂在生产成倍增长以后，某些辅助材料供应不足，辅助劳动力也感缺乏，同时有些职工家属要求参加劳动的情绪很高，却一时找不到生产门路，于是把情况汇报给街道党委，在街道党委统一领导下，积极参加组织了二千多名职工家属，办起八个民办工厂，生产了大批耐火材料，加工了大批石英、黄砂等，供应了工厂的需要，另外还组织了一个短途运输队帮助工厂运输。这些民办工厂和运输队，由于储蓄所积极帮助建立账目结算制度，培训财会人员等，都得到了巩固和发展，有力地支持了大工厂的生产跃进。
    为了解决职工家属参加劳动后的家务问题，储蓄所职工在街道党委领导下，同各部门协作配合，筹建了十二个民办食堂、十二个民办托儿所，并办起八个生活服务站，办理洗衣、缝补等二十多个服务项目。
    这个储蓄所在参加组织人民经济生活的活动中，随时开展勤俭建国、勤俭持家的宣传活动。在帮助职工安排生活的基础上，开展储蓄业务。例如，有些青年工人不会安排生活，储蓄所职工便一方面大力宣传节约的好处，一方面深入一个团小组具体帮助安排生活，取得经验全面推广。现在，全厂青年工人中，90％以上都经常储蓄。
    由于这个储蓄所积极工作，成为党委组织人民经济生活的有力助手，工厂和街道党委都更加重视银行的工作，积极加强领导，使银行本身的业务空前发展。现在，厂有储蓄委员会，车间有储蓄代办所，食堂设有储蓄代办员，使储蓄工作成了群众性的工作。储蓄额比过去有很大增长。
