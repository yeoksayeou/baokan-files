    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation issued a statement on the 10th regarding the U.S. government's persecution of Winston, saying: "When we heard the news that the U.S. government was brutally persecuting Henry Winston, the outstanding son of black people, the outstanding fighter for democracy and peace in the United States, and one of the leaders of the American Communist Party, we felt great indignation. We Chinese women strongly condemn the U.S. government's criminal act of violating basic humanitarian principles and persecuting Winston."
    The person in charge said, "This barbaric act of the U.S. government exposes the lies recently touted by the U.S. rulers that all U.S. citizens enjoy 'freedom' and 'justice,' and reveals the true face of the U.S. government in implementing fascist rule internally. The U.S. government's attempt to suppress the progressive forces in the United States and suppress the American people's demands for peace and democracy with such brutal means is doomed to fail. On the contrary, it will inevitably arouse stronger opposition from the broad masses of the American people to its strangling of democracy and its implementation of aggressive and war policies."
    The person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation finally said: "We Chinese women resolutely support the American people in their protest against this atrocity by the U.S. government in defending human rights. If the U.S. government continues to persecute Winston, it will inevitably arouse severe condemnation from all righteous and peace-loving people in the world."
    The person in charge of the All-China Youth Federation issued a statement on the 11th, protesting the reactionary crime of the U.S. government in persecuting Winston.
    The person in charge said: "Chinese youth have learned that Henry Winston, the outstanding peace and democratic fighter and black leader in the United States, almost completely lost his sight and was paralyzed in both legs after undergoing major brain tumor surgery, but the U.S. government cruelly refused to parole him for treatment and insisted on sending him back to prison, attempting to physically destroy this great life. Chinese youth express great anger and the strongest protest against this inhuman and reactionary atrocity of the U.S. authorities."
    The person in charge said: "Chinese youth firmly believe that the U.S. government's shameless atrocity of persecuting Winston will not only fail to stop the American people's just struggle for democracy and freedom, but on the contrary, will more thoroughly expose the reactionary essence of American fake democracy and fake freedom, and further expose U.S. imperialism as the number one enemy of all peace-loving and democratic people in the world."
    The person in charge finally said: "Chinese youth resolutely support the American people and youth's just struggle to support Winston, and solemnly demand that the U.S. authorities immediately stop this atrocity and restore Winston's freedom."

    我全国妇联、青联负责人发表谈话
    强烈抗议美国政府迫害温斯顿
    本报讯　中华全国妇女联合会负责人10日就美国政府迫害温斯顿一事发表谈话说：“当我们听到美国政府残暴地迫害黑人优秀的儿子、美国民主与和平的杰出斗士、美国共产党领导人之一亨利·温斯顿的消息时，感到很大的愤慨。我们中国妇女对美国政府这种违反起码的人道原则、迫害温斯顿的罪恶行为，表示强烈的谴责。”
    负责人说，“美国政府的这种野蛮行为，揭穿了美国统治者最近还在吹嘘的美国全体公民享有‘自由’和‘正义’的谎言，暴露了美国政府对内实行法西斯统治的真实面貌。美国政府企图用这种残暴的手段来压制美国的进步力量，并且压制美国人民对和平民主的要求是办不到的。正相反，势必引起美国广大人民对它的扼杀民主以及所执行的侵略政策和战争政策更加强烈的反对。”
    全国妇联负责人最后说：“我们中国妇女坚决支持美国人民为维护人权而对美国政府的这一暴行所进行的抗议。美国政府如果继续迫害温斯顿，必将引起全世界一切正义和爱好和平人民的严厉谴责。”
    中华全国青年联合会负责人11日发表谈话，抗议美国政府迫害温斯顿的反动罪行。
    负责人说：“中国青年得悉美国杰出的和平和民主的战士、黑人领袖亨利·温斯顿，在他进行切除脑瘤的大手术后双目几乎完全失明和双腿瘫痪的时候，美国政府却残忍地不让他假释出狱进行治疗，强要把他送回监狱去，企图从肉体上毁灭掉这个伟大的生命。中国青年对美国当局这一灭绝人性的反动暴行表示极大的愤怒和最强烈的抗议。”
    负责人说：“中国青年坚信，美国政府迫害温斯顿的无耻暴行不但不能阻止美国人民争取民主自由的正义斗争，相反地，更彻底地戳穿了美国假民主和假自由的反动本质，更进一步揭露了美帝国主义是全世界一切爱好和平与民主人士的第一号敌人。”
    负责人最后说：“中国青年坚决支持美国人民和青年声援温斯顿的正义斗争，并严正要求美国当局立即停止这一暴行和恢复温斯顿的自由。”
