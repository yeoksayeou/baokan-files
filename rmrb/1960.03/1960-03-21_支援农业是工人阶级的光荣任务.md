Supporting Agriculture is the Glorious Task of the Working Class
Lü Ying, First Secretary of the CPC Luoyang Municipal Committee

Industry and agriculture are the two most important material production sectors in the national economy. These two sectors are interdependent, mutually restrictive, and mutually promoting. As early as 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong comprehensively expounded the important position of agriculture in the entire national economy in his article "On Coalition Government." He said: "The peasants—they are the main body of China’s industrial market. Only they can supply the richest food and raw materials and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out that the development of agricultural production must adapt to the needs of socialist industrialization, and based on the practice of socialist construction in our country, he clearly put forward the idea of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously"; he emphasized that after agriculture realizes cooperativization, it should gradually realize agricultural technological transformation. Only by rapidly transitioning technologically backward agriculture to the basis of advanced technology and large-scale production can we guarantee the sustained high-speed and proportional leap forward of the entire national economy, and can our worker-peasant alliance be further consolidated and developed on a new basis.

Clarify Tasks, Assign Responsibilities, Conduct Research, Plan at All Levels

Luoyang City, like other parts of Henan Province, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Regional Party Committee, has carried out a series of work in the areas of industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural construction, and has achieved certain results. Judging from the development situation in recent years, it can be roughly divided into three stages: Before 1957, Luoyang City was in a period of industrial capital construction, and the industrial base was relatively weak. Apart from the original few local state-owned enterprises that had manufactured some new-style agricultural tools, partially adapting to some of the needs put forward by agriculture during the period of agricultural cooperativization, most of the support was seasonal in terms of manpower and materials. From 1957, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, on the one hand, the rural areas realized the people's commune system, which put forward more urgent requirements for industrial support for agriculture; on the other hand, the industrial enterprises built by the state in Luoyang had successively been put into or partially put into production, and small and medium-sized local enterprises had also been universally established. Therefore, various enterprises and departments not only gave great support to the vast number of peasants in the large-scale development of iron and steel, water conservancy construction, drought resistance, flood prevention, and busy farming seasons, but also established relatively fixed cooperative relationships with surrounding counties and communes, and provided equipment and technical assistance to county and commune industries, further strengthening the ties between urban and rural areas, and between workers and peasants, initially forming a huge collaborative network for industrial support for agriculture. Recently, various units have universally established or strengthened specialized institutions for supporting agriculture, planning at all levels, assigning responsibilities, strengthening fixed contact and cooperation with cooperative areas, and some have even established a monthly meeting system for leaders from both sides to further support county and commune industries with complete sets of equipment, thereby bringing industrial support for agriculture into a new stage of organized and led mass movement. According to incomplete statistics, in 1959, a total of 7,991 units (sets) of farming machinery, 1,879 units (sets) of irrigation and drainage machinery, 414 tons of scrap copper, and 1,998 tons of chemical fertilizers and pesticides were provided to the rural areas; more than 250 various technical personnel were trained for the rural people's communes. At the same time, thirty-five small and medium-sized factories directly serving agriculture have been established and expanded in the suburbs and rural areas of western Henan. In addition to ensuring the overfulfillment of the state plan and increasing the production of large numbers of tractors to support agricultural construction, the tractor factory also processed more than 90,000 tractor parts for all parts of the country, and processed and repaired more than 130,000 units (sets) of various equipment. The local state-owned Luoyang Machine Tool Factory produced batches of complete sets of simple machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, and planers suitable for small factories, which were supplied to rural community-run industries. All of these have played a significant role in supporting agricultural technological transformation.

Supporting Agriculture Promotes Industry, Creates Markets and Generates Capital

Industrial support for agriculture and the realization of agricultural technological transformation is not only the urgent requirement of agriculture itself and the vast number of peasants, but also the common desire of developing industry and the vast number of workers. According to the Marxist-Leninist principle of expanded reproduction, to accelerate the realization of national industrialization and develop socialist construction at high speed, we must adhere to the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Only by giving priority to the development of heavy industry can we continuously equip various departments of the national economy with advanced technology and promote the comprehensive upsurge of the national economy. However, the development of heavy industry must not be separated from agriculture and light industry and carried out in isolation. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," our country is a large agricultural country with a rural population accounting for more than 80% of the country's total population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture. Only then will industry have raw materials and markets, and will it be possible to accumulate more capital for the establishment of a strong heavy industry. Therefore, the speed of agricultural development not only directly affects the material and cultural life of the people, but also plays a decisive role in the speed and scale of industrial development. This truth has been proven by the practice of socialist construction in our country in recent years. Accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture can also continuously transfer a large amount of labor to industrial departments. In this regard, we have a relatively deep understanding. Luoyang City is a newly emerging industrial city. In recent years, the construction and development of large-scale industrial enterprises in Luoyang City have been carried out with the strong support of all parts of the country, including the vast rural areas. In recent years, the peasants of the western Henan region and other places have supplied all the materials and manpower needed for capital construction. Judging from the huge construction team that has been formed in Luoyang City, among the more than 134,000 workers, about 100,000 are young and middle-aged peasants from the western Henan region and the rural areas of the entire province.

In order to enable the development of agriculture to meet the needs of industrial development and promote the development of industry, it is necessary to greatly improve agricultural labor productivity and the commodity rate of products so as to free up more agricultural labor to support industrial construction and meet the needs of the comprehensive development of various construction undertakings. This requires industry to strengthen its support for agriculture and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture. Now, not only has the consolidation and development of the people's communes opened up broad prospects for realizing agricultural technological transformation, but also because my country's socialist industrialization already has a preliminary foundation, the potential for urban support for agriculture is also growing. Taking Luoyang City as an example, in the first month of 1960, various units provided 265 units (sets) of various mechanical equipment, 1,055 transportation vehicles, and 44,728 pieces of various agricultural tools to support agriculture, and processed and repaired more than 3,000 pieces of tools and equipment for agriculture. These figures are several times or even dozens of times higher than the same period last year. The agricultural tools alone are equivalent to more than 80% of the total for last year. This also shows that while accelerating socialist industrialization, actively promoting the technological transformation of agriculture is not only urgently needed, but also entirely possible.

Strengthen Propaganda and Education Work, Organize a Network to Support Agricultural Technological Transformation

The experience of the Luoyang area proves that to carry out the movement of industrial support for agricultural technological transformation well, first, we must adhere to putting politics in command. It is necessary to vigorously and meticulously conduct ideological education on industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas among the vast number of employees and cadres. Only when the vast number of people and cadres correctly understand the dialectical relationship between developing industry and developing agriculture, and regard supporting agriculture as the glorious historical task incumbent on the entire Party and the working class, can their initiative and consciousness be brought into full play.

Second, on the premise of ensuring the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of state plans, we must do everything possible to tap the production potential of existing enterprises, actively develop small and medium-sized enterprises serving agriculture under the leadership of modern large-scale enterprises, and form a network for supporting agricultural technological transformation combining large, medium, and small enterprises. Luoyang City's approach is as follows: According to the needs of agriculture and the possible conditions of various enterprises, we will help the suburbs and the nearby counties and people's communes to further develop and expand county and commune factories in a more planned and systematic way, provide them with equipment and technical assistance, help them grow from small to large, from indigenous to modern, and establish their own industrial bases as soon as possible, becoming an important force in realizing agricultural technological transformation. At the same time, we adopt the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to regularly or irregularly go deep into the rural areas to provide roving services, helping peasants repair machinery and solve technical problems. Through activities such as training courses, special lectures, production internships, and on-site guidance, we have trained many technical talents for the rural areas, such as tractor drivers, drivers, pump operators, machinists, and electricians, to adapt to the needs of production development and the comprehensive technological transformation of agriculture. In addition, while widely establishing cooperative relationships with rural areas, Luoyang City has also fixed cooperative areas and assumed full responsibility. Large factories in Luoyang City generally take responsibility for one or several counties, medium-sized factories take responsibility for one or several communes, and small factories take responsibility for one commune. There are many benefits to doing this. It enables each enterprise to have regularly connected rural bases, timely understand rural needs, and facilitate enterprises in formulating long-term and short-term plans to support agriculture, and supervise and check their implementation; it facilitates close relations between workers and peasants and further consolidates the worker-peasant alliance. Of course, while emphasizing the implementation of fixed support priorities, it is also very necessary to establish extensive cooperation with other vast rural areas within our capacity.

In the process of achieving the above achievements and experience in Luoyang City, we deeply feel that strengthening Party leadership, establishing and improving specialized institutions, and constantly checking the implementation of the situation is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in industrial support for agriculture.

According to the instructions of the Provincial and Regional Party Committees, the Municipal Party Committee studied and formulated a plan to support the rural areas last winter, putting forward specific requirements and measures; at the beginning of this year, it specially discussed and formulated a plan to support agriculture in 1960. Now, all supporting and supported units have further established and improved specialized institutions for industrial support for agriculture, and set up dedicated offices. This allows for unified leadership, facilitates discussions between the two sides, and strengthens supervision and inspection, thereby avoiding the past busy and chaotic phenomenon of some supported units, large and small, going to the factory for assistance, with many things to deal with, scattered energy, and affecting the planned solution of some major problems.

    支援农业是工人阶级的光荣任务
    中共洛阳市委第一书记　吕英
    工业和农业，是国民经济中最主要的两个物质生产部门。这两个部门是相互依存、相互制约、相互推动的。早在1945年，毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”一文中就全面的阐明了农业在整个国民经济中的重要地位。他说：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志又进一步指出农业生产的发展必须适应于社会主义工业化发展的需要，并且根据我国社会主义建设的实践，明确提出了“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”；强调指出在农业实现合作化以后，应该逐步的实现农业技术改造，只有使技术落后的农业迅速地转移到先进技术的大生产的基础上，才能保证整个国民经济高速度和按比例的持续跃进，才能使我国的工农联盟在新的基础上得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    明确任务　分工包干  调查研究　层层规划
    洛阳市和河南全省各地一样，遵循党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，在省委、地委的正确领导下，在工业支援农业、城市支援农村建设方面，曾经进行了一系列的工作，取得了一定的成绩。从几年来的发展情况看，大体上可分为三个阶段：1957年以前，洛阳市正处在工业基本建设时期，工业基础比较薄弱，除了原有的几个地方国营企业曾制造了一些新式农具，部分的适应了当时农业合作化时期对工业提出的一些需要外，一般的多是季节性人力、物力支援。从1957年起，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，一方面由于农村实现了人民公社化，对工业支援农业提出了更迫切的要求；另方面，国家在洛阳兴建的工业企业已经相继投入或部分投入生产，地方的中、小型企业也普遍兴办起来。因而，各类企业和各部门不仅在大办钢铁、兴修水利、抗旱、防汛和农忙季节给广大农民以大力的支援，而且和周围县、社建立了比较固定的协作关系，给县、社工业以设备和技术上的援助，进一步密切了城市与农村、工人与农民之间的联系，初步形成了一个庞大的工业支援农业的协作网。最近各单位普遍建立或加强了支援农业的专门机构，层层规划，分工包干，加强对协作区的固定联系和协作，有的还建立了一月一次的两方领导人员碰头联系制度，进一步以成套的装备支援县社工业，从而使工业支援农业进入了一个有组织、有领导的群众性运动的新阶段。据不完全的统计，1959年共支援农村耕作机械七千九百九十一台（件），排灌机械一千八百七十九台（件），碎铜废料四百一十四吨，化肥、农药一千九百九十八吨；为农村人民公社培训了各种技术人员二百五十多名。同时，已经为郊区和豫西农村建立和扩建了三十五个直接为农业服务的中、小型工厂。拖拉机厂除了保证超额完成国家计划，增产大批拖拉机支援农业建设外，还给全国各地加工了拖拉机零件九万多件，加工修理了各种设备十三万多台（件）。地方国营洛阳机床厂生产了成批的适用于小型工厂的车、铣、刨等成套简易机床，供应了农村社办工业。所有这些，对支援农业技术改造起了很大的作用。支援农业　促进工业　既有市场　又有资金
    工业支援农业，实现农业的技术改造，不仅是农业本身和广大农民的迫切要求，而且也是发展工业和广大工人的共同愿望。根据马克思列宁主义扩大再生产的原理，加速实现国家工业化，高速度的发展社会主义建设事业，必须坚持重工业优先发展的方针，只有优先发展重工业，才能不断的用先进技术装备国民经济各个部门，促进国民经济的全面高涨。但是重工业的发展决不能脱离农业和轻工业而孤立地进行，正如毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话中所说的，我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的80％以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举。工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。因此，农业发展的快慢不仅直接影响人民群众的物质文化生活，而且对工业发展的速度和规模也起着决定性的作用。这一真理，已为几年来我国社会主义建设的实践所证明。加速农业的技术改造，还可以不断地给工业部门输送大量的劳动力。在这方面，我们有着比较深刻的体会。洛阳市是一个新兴的工业城市，几年来洛阳市大规模工业企业的兴建和发展，一直是在全国各地包括广大农村在内的大力支援下进行的。几年来豫西地区以及各地农民供应了基本建设所需要的一切物资和人力。从现在洛阳市已经形成的庞大建设队伍来看，在十三万四千多名工人中，有十万人左右是来自豫西地区和全省农村的青壮年农民。
    为了使农业的发展能够适应工业发展的需要，并促进工业的发展，必须大大提高农业劳动生产率和产品的商品率，以便腾出更多的农业劳动力支援工业建设和满足各项建设事业全面发展的需要。这就要求工业必须加强对农业的支援，加速农业的技术改造。现在，不仅由于人民公社的巩固发展，为实现农业技术改造开辟了广阔的前途，而且由于我国社会主义工业化已经有了初步基础，城市支援农业的潜力也越来越大。以洛阳市为例，在进入1960年的头一个月内，各单位拿出支援农业的各种机械设备就有二百六十五部（台），运输机械一千零五十五辆，各种农具、工具四万四千七百二十八件，并为农业加工修理工具、器械三千件以上。这些数字都比去年同期增长了几倍以至十几倍。单是农具、工具一项，就等于去年全年的80％以上。这也说明在加速社会主义工业化的同时，积极推进农业的技术改造，不仅是迫切需要的，也是完全可能的。
    加强宣传教育工作组织支援农业技术改造网
    洛阳地区的经验证明，要很好地开展工业支援农业技术改造运动，首先，要坚持政治挂帅。要在广大职工和干部中大张旗鼓地、反复细致地进行工业支援农业、城市支援农村的思想教育。只有当广大群众和干部正确理解了发展工业同发展农业之间的辩证关系，把支援农业看做是全党和工人阶级责无旁贷的光荣历史任务，才能最充分地发挥他们的主动性和自觉性。
    其次，在保证全面完成和超额完成国家计划的前提下，千方百计地挖掘现有企业的生产潜力，在现代化大型企业的带动下，积极发展为农业服务的中、小型企业，组成大、中、小企业相结合的支援农业技术改造网。洛阳市的做法是这样的：根据农业需要和各个企业的可能条件，更有计划、有系统地帮助郊区和帮助附近的县和人民公社进一步发展和扩建县、社工厂，给以设备和技术上的援助，帮助他们由小到大、由土到洋，尽快的建立起自己的工业基地，成为实现农业技术改造的重要力量，同时，采用了领导干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”形式，定期或不定期的深入农村巡回服务，帮助农民检修机具，解决技术难题。通过训练班、专题讲课、生产实习、现场指导等活动，为农村培养了很多的拖拉机手、司机、司泵、车工、电工等技术人才，以适应生产发展和农业技术全面改造的需要。此外，洛阳市在和农村广泛建立协作关系的同时，还固定了协作区，包干负责。洛阳市的大型厂一般都包一县或数县，中型厂包一社或几社，小型厂包一社，这样作的好处很多。它可以使各个企业有经常联系的农村基点，及时了解农村需要，便于企业制定支援农业的长期和短期的规划，并督促、检查执行；便于密切工人和农民之间的关系，进一步巩固工农联盟。当然，强调实行固定支援重点的同时，在力所能及的情况下，和其它广大农村建立广泛的协作，这也是十分必要的。
    洛阳市在取得以上成绩和经验的过程中，我们深深感到加强党的领导，建立和健全专门机构，不断的检查执行情况是搞好工业支援农业的根本保证。
    市委根据省、地委的指示，在去年冬季就研究制定了支援农村的方案，提出了具体要求和措施；今年初又专门讨论制订了1960年支援农业的规划。现在各个支援与被支援单位都进一步建立和健全了工业支援农业的专门机构，设立有专门负责的办公室。这样做可以统一领导，便于双方商讨问题，加强督促检查，从而避免了过去某些被支援的大小单位都到厂求援，头绪繁多，分散精力，影响有计划的对一些重大问题的解决的忙乱现象。
