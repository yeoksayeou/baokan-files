Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 27th: The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Conference convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China began on March 26th. The purpose of this conference is to boost morale, vigorously conduct comparisons, summarize experience, strengthen leadership, and push the vigorously developing technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the city, with mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation as its content, to a new climax; and with this as the center, further promote the work of the city's industrial and agricultural production and construction, as well as transportation, finance and trade, science and culture, and other fronts, to a better and more comprehensive leap forward situation.

    A Technical Revolution Movement, Also a Production Revolution Movement, and a Thought Revolution Movement

    Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the opening meeting on the 26th. He said that the current excellent international and domestic situation is very favorable for us to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year. The situation in Shanghai is as good as in the rest of the country. The industrial output value in the first quarter of this year will definitely be higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. The "routine" that production in the first quarter has always been lower than in the fourth quarter of the previous year has been reversed. This year, on the industrial and agricultural production and construction fronts, as well as on other fronts, the prominent new things are: technical innovation and technical revolution have had new and greater development, and have become a conscious and great revolutionary movement of the masses. It is a technical revolution movement, also a production revolution movement, and also a thought revolution movement. This movement has developed very rapidly, its scale is unprecedentedly broad, its momentum is incomparably grand, its content is extremely rich, and its effect is particularly significant. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has not only improved the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, but also, from reforming and creating new tools and new equipment to adopting and creating new technologies, new processes, and new materials; from improving the quality of general products to creating a large number of high-quality, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new products; from changing product design to adjusting and improving production organization and labor organization, it has caused tremendous changes in production technology and the face of factories and enterprises, forming a comprehensive and large-scale torrent of technical transformation. The great practice of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has driven the great development of scientific research and cultural revolution. With the deepening of the technical revolution, many new topics have been put forward for scientific research work, and the working people increasingly need to learn culture and technology.

    In Technical Revolution, We Have Found a New Path for Developing Science and Technology with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results

    Comrade Ke Qingshi analyzed that the distinct characteristics of Shanghai's technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the past two months are: First, the movement has become a nationwide revolutionary movement. From neighborhood small factories to modern large factories, from manual production departments to advanced precision production departments, from the original backward departments to the original advanced departments, almost all have been involved in the movement. In the movement, the appearance of an advanced thing has caused a series of chain reactions, setting off a competition craze of catching up with each other. From one workshop to one factory, from one factory to the entire industry, it changes several times a day, constantly renewing itself, continuously revolutionizing, and the entire factory and industry are undergoing a great transformation, showing a moving scene of large-scale harvests. Transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, culture and education, and other departments, as well as neighborhoods and agencies, are also vigorously carrying out technical innovation, creating a hot atmosphere of everyone innovating, everything innovating, and every industry innovating.

    Second, in implementing the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, indigenous methods have shown great power. Many innovations in the movement have not relied on foreign equipment, but almost entirely on the masses relying on their own efforts and using indigenous methods to create indigenous equipment. It is precisely because of the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main method, that the technical innovation and technical revolution have quickly formed a vigorous mass movement. Indigenous methods are native-grown and simple, but they are by no means backward, but advanced and scientific. Indigenous methods have strong vitality, not only can solve key problems in production, but also can manufacture cutting-edge products. Major technical innovations must be carried out, and minor ones cannot be discarded. Workers say: "Major innovations are treasures, minor innovations are gems, and small pawns crossing the river can capture chariots and cannons." Therefore, to push the movement to a new climax, we must continue to break the superstition of valuing foreign over indigenous and valuing major over minor.

    Third, in the movement, the "five simultaneously" method (researching, designing, trial-producing, applying, and improving simultaneously) has been widely used, breaking the old conventions of mechanically dividing into three stages of scientific research, design, and trial production. This has enabled many innovations and creations to be gradually improved and enhanced in the process of use and practice, becoming an important form of technical management in enterprises. Facts have proved that adopting the "five simultaneously" method is a very effective way to achieve technical revolution with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and to cultivate and strengthen the technical force with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    Fourth, with good ideology and high style, people's mental outlook has undergone extremely profound changes. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the broad masses have further broken superstitions, emancipated their minds, dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to do, their courage has become greater and greater, their pioneering spirit is more sufficient, and their style is higher. Wang Linhe, a worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, did not lose heart even after 370 trials, and finally succeeded in developing the high-voltage bridge. Many workers have become "innovation enthusiasts," creating a boiling revolutionary atmosphere, and the revolutionary enthusiasm, revolutionary wisdom, and revolutionary perseverance hidden in the broad masses have been fully developed. There has been great development of the communist spirit of cooperation in the movement, becoming a new revolutionary fashion. Within factories, between factories, schools, and scientific research institutions, between industries and departments, between urban and rural areas, and even between family relatives, "three combinations" for innovation have appeared everywhere. Zhu Heng, an advanced producer at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, is called the "brain trust." This time, he helped his wife and female workers with many good ideas, enabling them to remove the binding tables used for manual coil winding for many years overnight.

    It can be seen from the above characteristics that: Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we have not only found a new path for developing science and technology with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in socialist transformation, but also in technical revolution.

    Comrade Ke Qingshi then analyzed the reasons for the rapid development of this movement. He said that the country's need to achieve continued leap forward this year has placed higher and greater demands on Shanghai. Therefore, objectively, Shanghai needs to better support the whole country with all its strength through technical innovation and technical revolution. This is one. Second, the workers themselves have strong demands. They are increasingly aware that relying on the existing technical foundation and not carrying out comprehensive technical transformation will not be able to adapt to the situation of continuous leap forward. They hope to get rid of heavy physical labor as soon as possible so that their enthusiasm and wisdom can be used more effectively. Third, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We have had rich experience from the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, and we also have more solid material and technical conditions than in the past. In this way, external and internal causes, coupled with the correct leadership of the Party, have become a great force, making it possible to carry out the technical revolution with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    We Must Treat the Great Technical Revolution Movement Actively, Enthusiastically, and with All Our Efforts

    This situation shows that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage. It is an important guarantee for the further great liberation and great development of social productive forces in our country, and for the continuous leap forward of socialist construction in our country. It strongly proves that the general line of socialist construction has a vigorous vitality, enabling us to build a strong socialist country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In this great movement, whoever adopts a positive, enthusiastic, and all-out attitude towards it, and stands at the forefront of the movement, can make the power of the general line even greater; whoever adopts a negative, right-leaning conservative attitude towards it will limit or even stifle the vitality of the general line, and even embark on a path that violates the general line.

    Comrade Ke Qingshi said that the current development of the movement is still uneven. The situation of mobilizing the masses is roughly: 40% of the units have been mobilized more deeply and thoroughly, 50% are not so deeply and thoroughly, and the masses in about 10% of the units have not yet been truly mobilized. The enthusiasm of our cadres is very high. They stand at the forefront of the movement like dragons and tigers, leading the movement forward, but some comrades are still lagging behind the situation. There are three reasons for this lag: First, although some comrades support the general line and agree to vigorously carry out the technical revolution, they have not consciously realized that in implementing the technical revolution, there is also a struggle between two methods: greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. One method is to be greedy for big and foreign, to be done by a few experts, and the movement is cold and clear. This is the method of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results in technical revolution. The other method is to rely on our own efforts, combine indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main method, and boldly mobilize the masses. The movement is vigorous and lively. This is the method of greater, faster, better, and more economical results in technical revolution. We must adhere to the latter method and reject the former method. Second, some comrades have not learned the art of leading such a large-scale technical revolution movement. They are not good at combining top-down leadership with bottom-up mobilization, not good at seizing the new sprouts that appear among the masses, making great publicity, creating momentum, and leading the movement forward, or do not understand that the movement should have work and rest, and advance in a wave-like manner. Therefore, although they are very anxious in their hearts and their motives are good, they are not good at analyzing the situation, grasping the key, busy and chaotic, and the results are not great, as criticized by the masses: "Ideology is advanced, but methods are backward." Third, there are still a few cadres who lack enthusiasm, do not understand the principle of continuous revolution, and do not recognize the importance of giving play to people's subjective initiative. There are also a few people who are content with the status quo and lack revolutionary enthusiasm. Their world outlook cannot reflect the revolutionary demands of the proletariat. Comrade Ke Qingshi called on all cadres to study hard, correct their shortcomings, help each other, and use the method of "one study, two corrections, and three helps" to quickly change the shortcomings of leadership lagging behind the situation.

    Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out that according to the requirements of the situation, Shanghai's tasks in the future are arduous and great. Not only must we complete and overfulfill the state plan, but also make Shanghai's industry move forward in great strides towards high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products; we must constantly change the face of our entire production, and further liberate the broad masses of workers from heavy labor; we must do everything possible to save raw materials, fully utilize raw materials comprehensively, and create more new raw materials; we must make Shanghai's scientific research work develop rapidly and vigorously, especially vigorously carry out the mass movement of scientific research, generally improve the cultural and technical level of the masses, and strive to climb the peak of science and technology; we must vigorously carry out cultural revolution, vigorously run spare-time education, and strive to meet the urgent needs of the working masses to learn culture and technology. To make Shanghai one of the national bases for high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products, and one of the national scientific and technological research centers. This is the glorious combat task of the entire party and the entire people of Shanghai.

    He said: To accomplish these tasks, the key is to develop the technical innovation and technical revolution movement more widely, more deeply, and more persistently. We must constantly sum up experience so that the broad masses of cadres can master the art of leading the technical revolution movement and lead the movement better.

    To Lead the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement, Grasp Six Words: Consolidate, Popularize, and Improve

    Comrade Ke Qingshi said that to lead the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must grasp six words: consolidate, popularize, and improve.

    In terms of consolidation, most of the technical innovation achievements we have already achieved are scientific, but some are not so perfect, and some new technologies have not been skillfully mastered by everyone. Consolidation is a process from imperfection to perfection, and from unfamiliarity to familiarity. This is also a process of struggle. The new processes, new equipment, new operating methods, and new technologies created by each factory, if they are good, must be consolidated one by one, and no one is allowed to be discarded. In the past, many good innovations and creations in the movement were lost because they did not pay attention to consolidation and improvement. The masses' energy and time were wasted. We must learn this lesson.

    In terms of popularization, we must comprehensively popularize the latest and most progressive technologies and experiences created by the masses that are effective in the same type of work and the same industry, so that they can fully blossom and bear fruit. With the development of the technical revolution movement, in improving production organization and labor organization, and enterprise management (including rules and regulations), it is also necessary to summarize experience and promote it.

    In terms of improvement, the technical revolution movement must be summarized and improved in a timely manner. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement develops in waves, one wave after another, one wave higher than another, and will develop forever. This is called continuous revolution. Therefore, we are required to organize the second climax before the first wave has subsided, so that the movement can continue to move forward. At the same time, technical innovation is also constantly developing and improving. Manual operations that have not been innovated need to be innovated, and those that have already been innovated must continue to be innovated. New inventions and creations, which are now considered the best and most advanced, will become outdated after a while. We must continuously revolutionize and continuously improve. There is no end to the progress of science and technology.

    He said that consolidation, popularization, and improvement are closely related. Correctly mastering these three links is also implementing the spirit of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolution. In this way, we can follow the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and make the movement advance continuously along the correct, scientific, and nationwide track.

    Comrade Ke Qingshi said that the most fundamental guarantee for accomplishing the above tasks is to strengthen the Party's leadership. In factories and enterprises where the movement is not deep or thorough and is lagging behind, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership, seize learning, consult with the masses, take measures, and change the situation. Departments with achievements in the movement should not be complacent either. Now the whole country is enthusiastically learning from Shanghai, catching up with Shanghai, and surpassing Shanghai. We should express a warm welcome. "The latecomer surpasses the former" is the law of the development of things. The places that are behind Shanghai will definitely catch up with and surpass Shanghai. This is a good thing. The people of Shanghai must carry forward the communist style and do everything possible to help others surpass themselves. There should not be any reservations. We must learn from everything that others are advanced. If we lag behind, we will catch up quickly. Can't we also "the latecomer surpasses the former"? In this way, you chase me and I chase you, and we can build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We must always learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. The key lies in having great enthusiasm. The problem of enthusiasm is the problem of fully developing subjective initiative. Enthusiasm does not fall from the sky, but comes from whether everyone serves the people wholeheartedly, and whether they are loyal to the revolutionary cause, and loyal to the cause of socialism and communism.

    Comrade Ke Qingshi finally called on Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, oppose right-leaning, boost morale, conduct comparisons, strive for the top, summarize experience, and formulate plans, so that technical innovation and technical revolution can advance along the correct, scientific, and nationwide track, and make the Party's general line exert greater power.

    以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为内容
    上海技术大革命运动沿着全民轨道前进
    柯庆施同志在工业会议上讲话，要求以不断革命精神，总结经验，抓紧巩固、推广和提高
    据新华社上海27日电　中共上海市委召开的上海市工业会议，3月26日开始举行。这次会议的目的是大鼓干劲，大搞评比，总结经验，加强领导，把全市正在蓬勃发展的以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为内容的技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高潮；并以此为中心，进一步把全市工农业生产建设以及交通运输、财政贸易、科学文化等各条战线的工作，推向一个更好更全面跃进的局面。
    是一个技术大革命运动，也是一个生产大革命运动，一个思想大革命运动
    中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志，在26日的开幕会上作了报告。他说，当前国际国内的大好形势对我们今年实现更好更全面的跃进十分有利。上海的形势和全国一样好，今年第一季度工业产值肯定可以高过去年第四季度，历来第一季度生产低于上年第四季的“常规”已经翻过来了。今年，在工农业生产建设战线上以及其他各条战线上，突出的新事物是：技术革新和技术革命有了新的更大的发展，已成为群众自觉的伟大的革命运动。它是一个技术大革命运动，也是一个生产大革命运动，又是一个思想大革命运动。这个运动发展十分迅猛，规模空前壮阔，声势无比浩大，内容极为丰富，效果也特别显著。技术革新和技术革命运动，不仅提高了机械化半机械化程度，而且从改革和创造新工具、新设备，到采用和创造新技术、新工艺、新材料；从提高一般产品的质量，到大量创制高、精、尖、新产品；从改变产品设计，到调整和改进生产组织、劳动组织，引起生产技术和工厂企业面貌的极大的变化，汇成了全面的大规模的技术改造的洪流。技术革新和技术革命运动的伟大实践，带动了科学研究工作和文化革命的大发展，随着技术革命的深入，对科学研究工作提出了许多新的课题，劳动人民也越来越需要学习文化、技术。
    在技术革命方面，我们已找到了一条多快好省发展科学技术的新道路
    柯庆施同志分析了两个多月来上海技术革新和技术革命运动的鲜明的特点是：第一，运动已经形成为全民性的革命运动。从里弄小厂到现代化大厂，从手工生产部门到高级精密的生产部门，从原来的落后部门到原来先进的部门，几乎全部卷入了运动。在运动中，一个先进事物的出现，就引起了一连串的连锁反应，掀起了你追我赶的竞赛热潮。从一个车间到一个厂，从一个厂到整个行业，一天几变，日新月异，不断革命，整个工厂、行业大翻身，出现了大面积丰收的动人景象。交通运输、基本建设、财贸、文教等各个部门，以至里弄、机关，也在大搞技术革新，造成人人革新、事事革新、行行革新的热气腾腾的局面。
    第二，在贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针中，土洋结合，而土法大显威风。运动中很多革新不是依靠洋设备，而几乎全是依靠广大群众自力更生，运用土办法，创制土设备来实现的。正是因为土洋结合，以土法为主，技术革新和技术革命很快形成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动。土办法是土生土长的、简易的，但决不是落后的，而是先进的、科学的。土办法有强大的生命力，不仅能解决生产上的关键问题，而且可以制造出尖端产品。技术革新大的要搞，小的也不能丢。工人说：“大革新是珍，小革新是宝，小卒子过河可以吃车马炮。”因此，要把运动推向新的高潮，就必须继续破除重洋轻土的迷信和重大轻小的观念。
    第三，在运动中，广泛运用了“五边”（边研究、边设计、边试制、边运用、边改进）的方法，破除了过去机械地划分为科学研究、设计、试制三阶段的陈规。这就使许多革新、创造在使用、实践过程中逐步改善和提高，成为企业中技术管理的重要形式。事实证明，采取“五边”方法，这是多快好省地实现技术革命，多快好省地培养和壮大技术队伍的极有成效的方法。
    第四，思想好，风格高，人们的精神面貌起了极为深刻的变化。广大群众根据毛主席的指示，进一步破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢说敢做，胆子越来越大，闯劲更足，风格更高。沪光科学仪器厂工人王林鹤，试验三百七十一次也不灰心，最后还是搞成功了高压电桥。许多工人成了“革新迷”，造成沸腾的革命气氛，广大群众蕴藏着的革命干劲、革命智慧和革命毅力充分发挥出来了。上海电机厂有两个工人睡在上下铺，都为了各自的一个革新难关，翻来复去睡不着，睡在下铺的工人偶见上铺工人翻身使床上的铁条伸缩不停，得到了启发，大叫：“关键找着了！”有一个女工，过去别人叫她“四不来”（讲话讲不来，生产快不来，脑筋动不来，到上海玩回不来），现在已变成了“样样来”，搞成功了不少革新。运动中，共产主义协作精神有了极大的发展，成为新的革命风尚。在工厂内部，工厂、学校、科学研究机关之间，各行业、各部门、城乡之间，甚至家庭亲属之间，到处出现了“三结合”搞革新。上海电机厂的先进生产者朱恒，人家叫他“智多星”，这次又帮助他的妻子和女工们出了很多好主意，使她们一夜搬掉了多年来手工包线圈用的包扎台。
    从以上特点可以看出：在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，我们不但在社会主义改造方面，而且也在技术革命方面找到了一条多快好省地发展科学技术的新的道路。
    柯庆施同志接着分析了这一运动迅猛发展的原因。他说，全国今年要实现继续跃进，对上海提出了更高更多的要求，因此客观上需要上海通过技术革新、技术革命，更好地尽一切力量支援全国，这是一。第二，工人群众本身有强烈的要求，他们愈来愈认识到依靠现有的技术基础，不进行全面的技术改造，不可能适应持续跃进的形势。他们希望早日摆脱繁重的体力劳动，使他们的干劲和智慧更有用武之地。第三，由于党的正确领导，总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝深入人心，我们有了两年来大跃进的丰富经验，也有了比过去更为雄厚的物质技术条件。这样，外因和内因，加上党的正确领导，就成为伟大的力量，使多快好省地进行技术革命成为可能。
    必须积极的、热情的、全力以赴的对待伟大的技术革命运动
    这种形势表明，技术革新、技术革命运动已经进入到一个新的阶段，它是我国社会生产力进一步大解放、大发展，以及使我国社会主义建设持续跃进的重要保证。它强烈地证明社会主义建设总路线具有旺盛的生命力，使我们能够更加多快好省地建设社会主义强国。在这一伟大的运动中，谁采取积极的、热情的、全力以赴的态度对待它，站在运动的前列，就能使总路线的威力更加发挥；谁要是采取消极的、右倾保守的态度对待它，就会限制以至窒息总路线的生命力，以至走上违背总路线的道路。
    柯庆施同志说，目前运动的发展尚不平衡，发动群众的状况大致是：40％的单位发动得较深透，50％不那么深透，还有10％左右的单位的群众尚未真正发动起来。我们广大干部的干劲是很大的，他们生龙活虎般地站在运动的前头领导运动前进，但也有些同志仍然落后于形势。这种落后的状况有三种原因：第一，有些同志虽然拥护总路线，赞成大搞技术革命，但他们没有自觉地认识到，在实行技术革命中，也同样存在着多快好省和少慢差费两种方法的斗争。一种方法是贪大求洋，由少数专家动手，运动冷冷清清，这是技术革命少慢差费的方法；另一种是自力更生，土洋结合，土法为主，放手发动群众，运动轰轰烈烈，这是技术革命多快好省的方法。我们要坚持后一种方法，拒绝前一种方法。第二，有些同志没有学会领导这样大规模的技术革命运动的领导艺术。他们不善于把自上而下的领导和自下而上的发动结合起来，不善于抓住群众中出现的新苗头，大张旗鼓、大造声势，领导运动前进，或者不懂得运动要有劳有逸、波浪式前进的规律。因此，尽管心里很急，动机很好，但是不善于分析形势，抓住关键，忙忙乱乱，成效不大，正如工人群众所批评的那样：“思想先进，方法落后”。第三，还有少数干部干劲不足，不懂得不断革命的道理，不认识发挥人的主观能动作用的重要性。还有少数人安于现状，缺乏革命热情，他们的世界观，不能反映无产阶级的革命要求。柯庆施同志号召所有干部努力学习，改正缺点，相互帮助，用一学、二改、三帮的办法，迅速改变领导落后于形势的缺点。
    柯庆施同志指出，根据形势的要求，今后上海的任务是艰巨的，伟大的。不但要完成和超额完成国家计划，而且要使上海的工业向高、精、尖大踏步前进；要使我们整个生产面貌不断变化，使广大工人群众从笨重的劳动中进一步解放出来；要千方百计地节约原材料，充分地综合利用原材料，创造更多的新原料；使上海的科学研究工作日新月异地发展起来，特别要大搞科学研究的群众运动，普遍提高群众的文化技术水平，努力攀登科学技术高峰；要大搞文化革命，大办业余教育，努力满足工人群众学文化、学技术的迫切需要。使上海成为全国高、精、尖基地之一，成为全国科学技术研究中心之一。这是上海全党、全民的光荣的战斗任务。
    他说：要完成这些任务，关键是更广泛、更深入、更持久地发展技术革新和技术革命运动。我们要不断总结经验，使广大干部都能掌握领导技术革命运动的艺术，把运动领导得更好。
    领导技术革新和技术革命运动要抓六个字：巩固，推广，提高
    柯庆施同志说，领导技术革新和技术革命运动，要抓六个字：巩固，推广，提高。
    在巩固方面，我们已经实现的技术革新成果，绝大部分是科学的，但有些还不是那么完善，有的新技术还没有为所有的人所熟练地掌握。巩固就是一个从不完善到完善、从不习惯到习惯的过程，这也是一个斗争的过程。各厂创造的新的工艺，新的设备，新的操作方法，新的技术，凡是好的必须有一条巩固一条，不许丢掉一条。以往运动中有许多好的革新创造，就是因为没有注意巩固提高，运动来时搞一阵，运动过后便丢掉了，群众的精力和时间都白费了。必须接受这个教训。
    在推广方面，要把群众创造的行之有效的最新最进步的技术和经验，在同工种同行业中全面推广，使它全面开花结果。随着技术革命运动的发展，在改善生产组织和劳动组织、企业管理（包括规章制度）等方面，也需要总结经验，加以推广。
    在提高方面，技术革命运动要及时总结、提高。技术革新和技术革命运动是波浪式发展的，一波又一波，一波高一波，永远发展下去。这就叫不断革命。因此要求我们在一波未平时又组织第二个高潮，使运动不断前进。同时，技术的革新也是不断发展，不断提高的。没有革新的手工操作需要革新，就是已经革新的还要继续革下去。新的发明创造，现在认为是最好最先进的，过些时候又会显得落后了。一定要不断革命，不断提高，科学技术的进步永远没有止境。
    他说，巩固、推广、提高这三者有密切联系。正确掌握好这三个环节，也就是贯彻了不断革命论和革命阶段论的精神。这样，我们就能遵照中央和毛主席的指示，使运动沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道不断前进。
    柯庆施同志说，实现以上任务，最根本的保证，是加强党的领导。在运动不深不透和落后的工厂企业，需要加强党的领导，抓紧学习，和群众商量，采取措施，改变面貌。运动有成绩的部门，也不要自满。现在全国学上海、赶上海、超上海很热烈，我们应该表示热烈欢迎。“后来居上”是事物发展的规律，比上海落后的地方一定会赶上和超过上海，这是一件好事。上海人民要发扬共产主义风格，尽一切力量帮助人家超过自己，不应该有一点保留。凡是人家先进的，我们一定要学习。如果落后了，就急起直追，我们不是一样可以“后来居上”吗？这样你追我赶，我赶你追，就可以又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义。我们永远要学先进、赶先进、超先进。关键在于要有一个很大的干劲。干劲问题，就是充分发挥主观能动性问题。干劲不是从天上掉下来的，而是来自每一个人是否全心全意为人民服务，是否忠于革命事业，忠于社会主义、共产主义事业。
    柯庆施同志最后号召各级党委加强领导，反右倾，鼓干劲，搞评比，争上游，总结经验，订出规划，使技术革新、技术革命沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道前进，使党的总路线发挥更大的威力。
