    Transferring Personnel Where There are Shortages, Sending Fertilizer Where There is a Lack, Fully Cooperating, Supporting Spring Ploughing
    Helping Backward Units Catch Up with Advanced Units
    Datong County, Qinghai Province, and Wuzhong Commune, Ningxia, Promote the Communist Spirit of Cooperation
    (By Our Reporter) As spring sowing is about to fully commence, Datong County, Qinghai Province, has organized shock brigades throughout the county to assist backward production teams in spring ploughing production. These backward production teams, with the support of manpower and materials from advanced production teams, and inspired by the communist spirit, are catching up in production. Consequently, the spring ploughing production in the county has seen an even more magnificent mass movement.
    Since winter, the mass movement of spring ploughing production in Datong County, centered on water and fertilizer, has been surging forward wave after wave. Especially after the provincial party committee issued the call for drought prevention and resistance, a spring ploughing blitz, and early sowing by seizing moisture, the 140,000 people of all ethnic groups in the county are even more high-spirited and full of fighting spirit, racing against time to complete various preparations for completing the spring sowing tasks early, quickly, and well. Judging from the spring ploughing preparation work, there is full confidence in completing this year's spring sowing tasks early, quickly, and well. However, the preparation progress of a very small number of production teams, especially the fertilizer transportation work, is relatively slow. Because the fertilizer link is relatively weak, it also affects the progress of other production work. In order to comprehensively do a good job in the current spring ploughing preparation work, the county party committee decided to mobilize the masses and, on the basis of voluntary participation, in accordance with the communist spirit of cooperation and the principle of equivalent exchange, organize shock brigades to support backward production teams in terms of manpower and materials.
    The advanced production teams in each commune regard supporting the backward production teams in developing production as their due obligation. More than 3,000 strong laborers and capable cadres were transferred to form a corresponding number of shock brigades to help backward production teams transport fertilizer. The Hongguang and Daitongzhuang production teams of Shuobei Commune transferred a total of 220 laborers to help the Lijiapu production team transport fertilizer; they also provided some fuel for fertilizer production.
    This work of helping backward teams has also been extended to between communes. Shuobei Commune formed a shock brigade of one hundred people and fifty large carts, carrying tools and grain, to assist the Hualin Brigade of Dongxia Commune, more than twenty miles away, with spring ploughing. Jingyang Commune also organized a shock brigade of one hundred people to support the Jile Production Team of Chengguan Commune. Qingshan Commune transferred three hundred strong laborers to help Duolin Commune.
    The county-wide great collaboration movement to help the backward fully reflects the high communist spirit of the broad masses. When advanced teams organized shock brigades to support backward teams, they held meetings of commune members for mobilization. The broad masses of commune members enthusiastically signed up at the meetings, considering participation in the shock brigade the greatest honor. The commune members of the Hongguang Production Team of Shuobei Commune who remained at home expressed to the commune members who were supporting outside teams: We will definitely exert greater effort to do a good job in production, hoping that they will support the backward teams with peace of mind.
    This mass movement to help the backward is also the result of party organizations at all levels further implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's working method of grasping both ends to promote the middle. By organizing advanced teams to help backward teams, on the one hand, the actual difficulties of backward teams are solved in terms of manpower and materials. More importantly, backward teams are encouraged to have great ambitions and establish great aspirations to catch up with advanced production teams. With the help of the Qingshui Production Team, the Yaozhuang Production Team of Jingyang Commune used only six days to replenish the fertilizer for more than 500 mu of land, reaching about 15,000 jin per mu. Cadres and masses have checked their own production and work, and they all feel that the backwardness in production is mainly due to the fact that their thinking cannot keep up with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. They expressed that they must exert great effort to reach the level of advanced production teams in a short period of time; the attendance rate and labor efficiency of commune members have been significantly improved.
    (By Our Reporter) Wuzhong Commune of Wuzhong City, Ningxia Autonomous Region, organized a large-scale collaboration between large brigades and production teams during spring sowing to ensure that the spring sowing task of the entire commune is fully completed before the "Awakening of Insects."
    Wuzhong Commune plans to sow 31,200 mu of wheat this year, an increase of more than 30% over last year. Due to the implementation of intensive cultivation, the total number of man-days per mu in spring sowing has increased by 97% compared to last year. With the expansion of the sown area and the increase in labor input per unit area, how can we ensure that the spring sowing task of the entire commune is fully completed before the "Awakening of Insects"? The commune party committee made a detailed analysis and study. According to the calculation of the labor force, animal power, and many material conditions of the entire commune, it is possible to complete it in time. However, after a specific inspection, it was found that among the 154 production teams in the 23 large brigades of the entire commune, 8 large brigades such as the Five-Star Brigade and 35 production teams had less labor and animal power, a large sowing task, many ploughed furrows to be adjusted, and some teams also lacked fertilizer and seeds, making it difficult to complete the task on schedule; some teams had surplus labor and animal power in addition to completing the task. Based on this situation, the commune party committee convened a meeting of party general branch secretaries of major brigades in early February to uniformly plan the sowing work of the entire commune and carry out collaboration between major brigades and production teams to ensure the comprehensive completion of the spring sowing task before the "Awakening of Insects." On the one hand, the commune will use all 11 tractors and other means of production to support large brigades and production teams with weak sowing power; on the other hand, major brigades will find their own opponents and sign collaboration contracts on the premise of equivalent exchange. The 7 stronger brigades such as the Xinsheng Brigade transferred 110 heads of draught animals, 42 vehicles, and 6,000 carts of fertilizer to support 8 weaker brigades. At the same time, 154 production teams also signed collaboration contracts under the leadership of the party general branch of the large brigade, and 35 weaker production teams received support from other teams. After the Chenyuantan No. 1 Brigade received 5,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer from the Xinsheng Brigade, the commune members said with emotion: Without the commune, there would be no such good fertilizer. Now that people have delivered it to our door, we must work harder and answer the help of the Xinsheng Brigade with greater harvests.

    缺人调人　缺肥送肥　全力协作　支援备耕
    帮助后进单位迎头赶先进
    青海大通县宁夏吴忠公社大兴共产主义协作之风
    本报讯　青海大通县在春播即将全面开展的时候，在全县范围内，组织突击队，帮助备耕生产中的后进生产队。这些后进生产队由于得到先进生产队的人力、物力的支援，以及共产主义风格的鼓舞，生产迎头赶上。从而，全县的春耕生产，出现了规模更加壮阔的群众运动。
    入冬以来，大通县的以水、肥为中心的备耕生产群众运动，一浪高过一浪，始终蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。尤其是省委发出防旱抗旱、突击春耕、抢墒早播的号召以后，全县十四万各族社员，更加意气风发、斗志昂扬，争分夺秒地为又早、又快、又好地完成春播任务，进行各项准备工作。从春耕准备工作看来，早、快、好地完成今年的春播任务，是有充分把握的。但是，也有极少数生产队的备耕进度，尤其是肥料的运送工作，却比较缓慢。由于肥料这一个环节比较薄弱，也影响到其他生产工作的进展。为了全面地做好当前备耕工作，县委决定发动群众，在自觉自愿的基础上，按照共产主义协作精神和等价交换的原则，组织突击队，从人力、物力方面支援后进生产队。
    各公社先进的生产队都把支援后进的生产队发展生产，当成自己应尽的义务。共抽调了三千多个强壮劳动力和得力干部，组成相应数目的突击队，帮助后进生产队运送肥料。朔北公社红光、代同庄等四个生产队，共抽调了二百二十个劳动力，帮助李家堡生产队运送肥料；还支援了部分造肥的燃料。
    这种帮助后进队的工作，还被扩大到公社与公社之间，朔北公社由一百人和五十辆大车，组成了突击队，携带工具、粮食，到二十多里外的东峡公社桦林大队，协助春耕。景阳公社也组织了一百人的突击队，支援城关公社极乐生产队。青山公社则抽调了三百个强壮劳动力，帮助多林公社。
    全县范围的帮后进的大协作运动，充分反映了广大群众的高度的共产主义风格。先进队在组织突击队支援后进队时，都召开了社员大会进行动员，广大社员在会上踊跃报名，以参加突击队为最大光荣。朔北公社红光生产队在家的社员，向支援外队的社员表示：一定鼓足更大干劲，搞好生产，希望他们安心地支援后进队。
    这种帮后进的群众性运动，也是各级党组织进一步贯彻执行毛泽东同志的抓两头带动中间的工作方法的结果。通过组织先进队帮助后进队，一方面从人力、物力上解决后进队的实际困难，更重要的是鼓舞后进队立大志、树雄心，迎头赶上先进的生产队。景阳公社窑庄生产队在清水生产队的帮助下，只用六天时间，就补足了五百多亩地的肥料，每亩达到一万五千斤左右。干部、群众纷纷检查自己的生产和工作，都觉得生产上的落后，主要是由于思想赶不上大跃进的形势，表示一定要鼓足干劲，在短期内达到先进生产队的水平；社员的出勤率和劳动效率都有了显著提高。
    本报讯　宁夏自治区吴忠市吴忠公社在春播中组织各大队、生产队之间的大协作，保证全公社春播任务在惊蛰以前全面完成。
    吴忠公社今年计划播种小麦三万一千二百亩，比去年增加30％多。由于实行精耕细作，在春播中每亩地的用工总数比去年增加97％。播种面积扩大，单位面积用工增加，如何保证全公社春播任务提早到
  “惊蛰”以前全面完成？公社党委作了详细的分析和研究。根据全公社的劳、畜力和许多物质条件计算，是可以及时完成的。但是，经过具体检查以后，发现全公社二十三个大队一百五十四个生产队中，有五星等八个大队和三十五个生产队劳畜力较少，播种任务大，调槎子多，部分队还缺少肥料和种子，按期完成任务有困难；有些队完成任务之外，劳畜力还有富余。根据这个情况，公社党委在2月上旬召开的各大队党总支书记会议上，统一筹划全公社的播种工作，在各大队、生产队之间开展协作，确保“惊蛰”前全面完成春播任务。一方面，以公社所有的十一台拖拉机和其他生产资料，支援播种力量薄弱的大队和生产队；另一方面，在等价交换的前提下，各大队自找对手签订协作合同。新生等七个力量较强的大队，抽调出耕畜一百一十头、车四十二辆、肥料六千车，支援八个力量薄弱大队。与此同时，一百五十四个生产队也在大队党总支领导下互订协作合同，力量较单薄的三十五个生产队分别得到其他队的支援。陈袁滩一大队得到新生大队五千斤优质肥的支援后，社员们感动地说：没有公社就别想有这么好的肥料。现在人家给送上门来了，咱们一定要加劲猛干，用更大的丰收来回答新生大队的帮助。
