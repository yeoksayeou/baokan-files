    Innovating Equipment While Training Workers
    Bada Rivet Factory Runs Training Classes to Ensure Automatic Production Lines Fully Demonstrate Their Power
    (Our newspaper's Guangzhou, March 14th dispatch - reporter Zhao Ying) The Guangzhou Bada Rivet Factory, after building two modern automatic production lines, faced the difficulty of insufficient technical personnel. To overcome this, they proposed matching the enthusiasm for mechanization and automation with vigorous efforts to train technical personnel. In a short period, they cultivated a group of workers capable of mastering new technologies, ensuring the rapid commissioning of the two production lines.
    Over a month ago, the factory's employees spent several days and nights rapidly building automatic production lines for twelve-millimeter and eight-millimeter screws. Each of these two automatic lines consists of three new, modern machines: a cold heading machine, a trimming machine, and a thread rolling machine. They are complex in structure and have high technical requirements. At that time, the entire factory had only three experienced technicians who could operate and maintain these machines; however, each automatic line required three workers per shift. Therefore, after the two automatic lines were built, due to a shortage of technical personnel, only one automatic line actually operated for one shift. The factory originally planned to send people to similar factories in Shenyang to learn; however, various sectors urgently needed this specification of screws, and only operating both lines for two shifts could meet the demand. Therefore, the factory's Party branch promptly studied this situation and decided to match the enthusiasm for mechanization and automation with vigorous efforts to train technical personnel.
    In late February, a self-reliant training class that closely combined theory and practice was started under the leadership of the factory's Party branch. Without teachers, the factory's technical section assisted, and the three experienced technicians who had already mastered the automatic production lines, Huang Zhi (recently promoted to engineer), Qu Biao (promoted to technician), and Ye Zhuoneng, director of the automatic production line workshop, combined their operational experience to give lectures. These lectures were integrated with on-site teaching, apprenticeship, live demonstrations, and other methods. Because the experienced technicians taught conscientiously and received theoretical assistance from the technical section, the lectures were very effective. After the first lesson on "Operating Methods and Machine Concepts" in late February, the learners generally understood the machine's structure, performance, and usage. The experienced technicians were meticulous and thorough yet boldly delegated responsibility during on-site teaching and apprenticeship in daily production. For example, during on-site teaching about changing specifications, the technicians disassembled the machines on the spot, demonstrated the process once, and then asked everyone to raise questions until they learned. After the participating workers made some progress, the experienced technicians allowed everyone to perform practical operations, while they pointed out and checked from the side, explaining afterwards. The participating workers also engaged in mutual teaching and learning activities. For example, worker Qu Tingzu made rapid progress and operated well, so he gave a live demonstration, explaining the technology and his learning process, which was very inspiring to others.
    Currently, among the twenty-three workers in the first batch participating in the training, sixteen can operate independently. With the rapid growth of technical personnel, the situation of having machines but no one to use them has changed. Starting from February 28th, the number of automatic lines in production increased from one to two. In March, both automatic lines operated for two shifts. The output of products also continued to rise. For example, the automatic line producing twelve-millimeter screws produced five hundred pieces on February 22nd, and then rose sharply. By March 4th, the daily output had soared to 28,656 pieces. To more skillfully master operating techniques, the factory established a technical learning leading group and also formulated new rules and regulations to meet the needs of new technologies. The main method is to combine leadership and the masses to formulate operating procedures for automatic production lines. First, the technical section drafts procedures based on operating principles and the practical experience of experienced technicians, then submits them to the masses for discussion, and then revises and finalizes them. In addition, technical grade standards are also being developed accordingly to ensure that all aspects of work keep up with the needs of new technologies.

    一面革新设备　一面培训工人
    八达铆钉厂自办训练班保证自动线充分发挥威力
    本报广州14日电　记者赵颖报道：广州市八达铆钉厂在建成两条现代化的生产自动线以后，为了克服技术力量不足的困难，提出用大搞机械化、自动化的劲头来大抓技术力量的培训工作。在短短时间内，他们就培养出一批能够掌握新技术的工人，保证两条生产自动线迅速投入了生产。
    一个多月前，这个厂的职工以几昼夜的时间迅速建成了十二毫米和八毫米螺丝钉生产自动线。这两条自动线各由冷镦机、切边机、搓丝机等三台新的现代化机器组成，构造复杂、技术要求高。当时全厂能操作、维修这些机器的，只有三个老技工；而每条自动线每班就需要三个工人操作。因此，两条自动线建成以后，由于技术力量不足，实际上只有一条自动线，开一班生产。厂里原计划派人到沈阳同类工厂去学习；但是，目前各方面迫切需要这种规格的螺丝，两条线开两班才能满足需要，因此这个厂的党支部及时研究了这一情况，决定以大搞机械化、自动化的劲头来大抓技术力量的培训工作。
    2月下旬，一个自力更生、理论与实践紧密结合的训练班在工厂党支部的领导下开办了。没有教师，就在厂的技术股协助下，由已经掌握生产自动线的老技工黄志（最近提拔为工程师）、区标（提拔为技师）和生产自动线车间主任叶卓能三人结合操作实践进行讲课，并且和现场教学、带徒弟、现场表演等各种方法结合起来一并进行。由于老技工教学认真，又得到了技术股从理论上的协助，因此讲课的效果很好。2月下旬在讲第一课“操作方法和机器概念”后，学的人一般都能了解机器的构造、性能和使用方法。老技工在现场教学和在日常生产中带徒弟时，都做到了既细致周到又大胆放手。如在关于调换规格的现场教学中，技工们当场解剖，作完一遍，又让大家提问题，直到学会为止。当参加学习的工人有了一定的进步以后，老技工又放手让大家进行实际操作，自己则在一边指点、检查，做完后再进行讲解。参加学习的工人，也展开互教互学活动。如工人区庭佐学习进步快，操作较好，就由他作现场表演，一边讲技术，一边讲学习经过，对其他的人很有启发。
    目前，这个厂在第一批参加学习的二十三个工人中，已有十六人能单独操作。随着技术力量的迅速成长，有机器没人用的情况已经改变。从2月28日开始，便由原来的一条自动线投入生产增加到两条线都投入了生产。3月份，这两条自动线开足了两班。产品的产量也不断上升。如生产十二毫米螺丝的自动线在2月22日生产了五百支，以后就直线上升，到3月4日，日产量已猛增到二万八千六百五十六支。为了更熟练地掌握操作技术，这个厂成立了技术学习领导小组，还针对新技术的需要制订新的规章制度。主要是用领导和群众结合的办法制订生产自动线的操作规程；先由技术股根据操作原理和老技工的实践经验作出规程草案，再交群众讨论，然后修订确定。此外，还正在相应作出技术等级标准等，以便使各方面工作跟上新技术的需要。
