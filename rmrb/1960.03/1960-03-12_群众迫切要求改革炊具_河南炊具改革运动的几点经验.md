    The Masses Urgently Demand Reform of Cooking Utensils
    ——Some Experiences from the Cooking Utensil Reform Movement in Henan
    Henan Provincial People's Committee Agricultural Tool Reform Office
    The large-scale, mass-based reform movement of cooking utensils and agricultural product processing tools in Henan Province has been vigorously developing for the past two years. With the great leap forward and bumper harvest in agricultural production, the tasks of processing agricultural products have greatly increased. At the same time, after the realization of collective living in the People's Communes, the old-fashioned cooking utensils originally used by individual households can no longer meet the needs of public canteens. Vigorously engaging in the reform of cooking tools and processing tools has become an urgent demand of the broad masses. The Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have firmly grasped this demand of the masses and launched a reform movement of cooking utensils and processing tools throughout the province, which has now achieved great results. The province has created, imitated, and reformed approximately 2.3 million pieces of advanced cooking utensils and processing tools, including more than 70,000 improved mills, more than 30,000 improved stoves, and more than 120,000 self-flowing water systems. More than 40% of the province's 300,000+ canteens have basically achieved semi-mechanization in terms of major cooking utensils (individual canteens in urban industrial and mining areas have initially achieved mechanization of cooking utensils). The province has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in the processing of grain (milling), cotton (ginning), and sweet potatoes (slicing). Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses have created many advanced cooking utensils and processing tools that are highly efficient, of good quality, low cost, and easy to operate. The "Yudong No. 1" combined rapid automatic mill manufactured by Wuqiang Commune in Shangqiu County mills more than 30,000 catties of flour per day. Areas with suitable conditions have universally promoted water mills, wind-powered mills, and biogas mills, initially utilizing natural energy. Suixian County has universally promoted hand-operated universal water pumps, which can meet the water needs of a 200-person canteen with 20 minutes of operation by one person. In terms of stoves, single-burner, double-burner, multi-burner return-air stoves, and small-mouth forced-air stoves have been widely promoted, generally saving half the fuel. In terms of cooking utensils, versatile vegetable cutting machines, vegetable washing machines, automatic combined noodle pressing machines, egg beaters, meat grinders, dumpling making machines, dishwashers, etc., have also been created. In terms of sweet potato processing, there are various processing tools that are hand-cranked, foot-pedaled, and power-driven. Once these tools have power, with a little improvement, they can become mechanized tools. At present, the province's cooking tools and processing tools are rapidly developing towards universalization, systematization, and from semi-mechanization to mechanization.

    After the reform of cooking utensils and processing tools, great changes have taken place in all aspects. First, labor and animal power have been saved. According to preliminary statistics, in the reform of cooking utensils alone, the province has saved more than one million laborers and more than 500,000 head of livestock, powerfully strengthening the front line of production. Second, the labor intensity of cooks has been reduced, labor conditions have been improved, and the appearance of canteens has been renewed. After the reform of cooking utensils, the working hours of cooks have been reduced from more than ten hours to about eight hours. Cooks not only have time for rest, recreation, and study, but especially can concentrate on improving cooking techniques, improving the quality of food, achieving food diversification, so that the masses can eat their fill, eat well, and save money. The reform of cooking utensils has also greatly helped canteens save various expenses and reduce costs. The most prominent is the stove reform, which generally reduces coal consumption from about one catty per person per day to about half a catty. After stove improvement throughout the province, more than 7 billion catties of coal can be saved in a year. After the reform of cooking utensils, canteen staff can take out part of their time to engage in vegetable growing, animal husbandry, and small workshops, so that the canteen's financial resources become richer day by day, enhancing the material basis for regulating and improving life. The reform of cooking utensils and processing tools has further demonstrated the superiority of the People's Communes, consolidated and improved public canteens, improved people's lives, and promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    The reason why we have been able to achieve the above achievements is mainly because we have strengthened the leadership of the Party, grasped tightly and fiercely, thoroughly criticized right-leaning tendencies, mustered full energy, implemented the policy of self-reliance, local material procurement, adapting to local conditions, focusing on indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and adopted the method of vigorously launching mass movements. We have focused on the following links in leading this movement:

    First, strengthening the leadership of the Party is the key to rapidly launching the reform movement of cooking utensils and processing tools. From April 1958 to January of this year, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee successively convened six provincial-level tool reform conferences. Wu Zhipu, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally took charge of this matter. Through these meetings, experiences were summarized and exchanged, problems in the progress were solved, and the progress of the movement was greatly promoted. Each special district, county, and commune implemented the leadership of the First Secretary, with professional secretaries responsible. In addition to the First Secretary taking charge, Shangqiu County also established a stone mill improvement committee headed by the agricultural secretary. In the work of cooking utensil reform, they conscientiously implemented the policy of procuring materials locally, focusing on indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, clearly focusing on tools with great efficiency, labor saving, and simple technology, and making reform plans at all levels. For example, in the reform of cooking utensils, we seized "four-izations" (milling powerization, cooking utensil semi-mechanization, water self-flowing, and stove improvement); in the reform of processing tools, we focused on the processing of grain, cotton, and sweet potatoes. The reform of these tools can not only save a lot of labor, but also drive the development of the entire movement.

    Second, conscientiously implementing the policy of focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, self-reliance, local material procurement, and adapting to local conditions is the central link in launching a mass-based reform movement of cooking utensils and processing tools. Facts have proven that the current modified and created cooking utensils and processing tools are largely indigenous. Focusing on indigenous methods is suitable for our current material conditions and technical conditions, and it can mobilize the whole people to vigorously engage in tool reform. Focusing on indigenous methods does not mean that we do not want foreign methods. In urban suburbs and communes with good technical conditions, foreign methods have also begun to appear. The development law of cooking utensil reform is also from indigenous to foreign, from simple to complex, from the reform of individual tools to systematic sets, from semi-mechanization to mechanization. For example, the stone mill improvement in our province has gone from adding ball bearings to the original mill to a multi-fan mill pulled by one horse, and then to a wooden flour mill (the wooden flour mill in Qixian County is powered by a small steel mill); sweet potato slicing has gone from hand-cranked, foot-pedaled to horse-drawn, all the way to power-driven; from a simple slicer to a systematic set of crushing and flour-making. The materials needed for the reform of cooking utensils and processing tools implemented the policy of procuring materials locally and self-reliance. In the improved mill movement, Xuchang Special District, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, raised 360,000 catties of iron and more than 10,000 cubic meters of wood. If some materials are lacking, try to find substitutes, such as using cloth belts instead of leather belts, and bamboo poles and ceramic tubes instead of steel pipes, etc. In this way, in addition to the state supplying only a small amount of higher-grade raw materials, most of the materials were solved by the masses raising their own funds.

    Third, organize technical teams, strengthen technical guidance, and develop the reform movement of cooking utensils and processing tools quickly, well, and economically. A large-scale tool reform movement requires a lot of technical power. In order to solve this problem, various places have universally adopted a combination of professional teams and mass-based invention and creation methods. In the movement to realize the "four-izations" of cooking utensils in Xinxiang area, in addition to mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, everyone invented and created, and everyone took action, they also mobilized more than 90,000 skilled craftsmen to form more than 10,000 professional teams to go deep into the front lines to help the masses create, imitate, research, appraise, and promote the products created by the masses, which greatly accelerated the development of the movement. Local industries provided strong technical assistance, dispatching technical personnel to go deep into canteens to provide guidance. Organize cooperation between communes and communes, teams and teams, and canteens and canteens, adopting the methods of inviting in and sending out to solve technical difficulties. Organize technical guidance stations and counseling groups, use the methods of masters mentoring apprentices and running short-term technical schools and training classes to train a large number of new technical forces in a timely manner. Some use advanced units as schools, advanced cooking utensils as teaching materials, and specific operations for teaching, and inventors as lecturers to train technical personnel. Because the mass line method of learning from practice and practicing in learning was adopted, not only was the difficulty of insufficient technical power smoothly solved, but also a large number of technical personnel who created tools and used tools were trained. At the same time, mass-based inventions and creations must be combined with scientific research and timely sample selection and finalization, and the inventions and creations of the masses must be collected in a timely manner, and after scientific sample selection and finalization, they should be promoted according to local conditions. We must both invent, appraise, produce, promote, and use at the same time, and improve and improve again in use. Only in this way can we ensure the continuous improvement of product quality and make the movement develop rapidly.

    群众迫切要求改革炊具
    ——河南炊具改革运动的几点经验
    河南省人民委员会农具改革办公室
    河南省炊具和农产品加工工具大规模的群众性的改革运动，两年来有了蓬勃的开展。随着农业生产的大跃进、大丰收，农产品加工任务大大增加；同时，在人民公社实现生活集体化之后，原来一家一户所使用的旧式炊具已不能适应公共食堂的需要。大搞炊事工具和加工工具的改革，已成为广大群众的迫切要求。中共河南省委、省人委紧紧抓住了群众这一要求，在全省范围内开展了炊具、加工工具的改革运动，现已取得巨大成绩。全省已创制、仿制、改制先进炊具、加工工具约二百三十万件，其中改良磨七万多盘，改良灶三万多个，自流水十二万多处。全省三十多万个食堂，有40％以上，在主要炊具方面基本上实现了半机械化（城市工矿的个别食堂已经初步实现了炊具机械化。）全省在粮（磨面）、棉
  （轧花）、红薯（切片）等加工方面，已基本实现了机械化和半机械化。广大群众在党的领导下，创造了许多功效高、质量好、成本低、操作简便的先进炊具和加工工具。商丘县坞墙公社制造的豫东一号联合快速自动磨，日磨面粉三万余斤。有条件的地区普遍推广了水磨、风力磨、沼气磨，初步利用了自然能源。睢县普遍推广了手压万能抽水机，一人操作二十分钟，能满足一个二百人食堂用水的需要。在炉灶方面，普遍推广了单眼、双眼、多眼回风灶、小口吹风灶等，一般能节省一半燃料。在炊具方面还创制了万能切菜机、洗菜机、自动联合压面条机、打蛋机、剁馅机、包饺子机、洗碗机等。在红薯加工方面，有手摇的、脚踏的、动力的多种多样的加工工具。这些工具一旦有了动力，再稍加提高，便可成为机械化的工具。目前，全省的炊事工具和加工工具正向普遍化、系统成套化和由半机械化向机械化的方向迅速发展。
    炊具和加工工具改革后，使各方面发生了很大的变化。首先节省了劳畜力。据初步统计，仅炊具改革一项，全省节省出劳力一百多万人、畜力五十余万头，有力的加强了生产第一线。其次，减轻了炊事员的劳动强度，改善了劳动条件，食堂的面貌为之一新。炊具改革后，炊事员的劳动时间由十几个小时降低到八小时左右。炊事员不仅有了休息、娱乐和学习的时间，特别是能集中精力改进做饭技术，提高饭菜质量，达到饭菜多样化，使群众可以吃饱、吃好、又节省。炊具的改革还大大帮助食堂节省了各种开支，降低了成本。比较突出的是锅灶改革，一般由原来每人每日烧煤一斤左右降低到半斤左右。全省经过炉灶改良，一年可节省煤七十多亿斤。炊具改革后，食堂工作人员可拿出一部分时间，从事种菜、饲养业和小作坊，使食堂的家底一天天雄厚起来，增强了调剂和改善生活的物质基础。炊具和加工工具的改革，进一步显示了人民公社的优越性，巩固提高了公共食堂，改善了人民的生活，促进了工农业生产的发展。
    我们所以能够取得上述的成绩，主要是加强党的领导，抓紧抓狠，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，贯彻了自力更生、就地取材、因地制宜、土法为主、土洋结合的方针，采用了大搞群众运动的方法。我们在领导这一运动中着重抓了如下几个环节：
    一、加强党的领导是迅速开展炊具和加工工具改革运动的关键。自1958年4月到今年1月，省委、省人委先后召开了六次全省性的工具改革会议。省委第一书记吴芝圃同志亲自抓这件事。通过这些会议，总结交流了经验，解决了前进中的问题，大大推动了运动的进展。各专、县、社都实行了第一书记挂帅，专业书记负责。商丘县除第一书记挂帅外，又以农业书记为首成立了石磨改良委员会，在炊具改革工作中，认真贯彻就地取材、土法为主、土洋结合的方针，明确以效力大、节省劳力多、技术简便的工具为中心，层层作出改革规划。如在炊具改革中，我们抓住“四化”（磨面动力化、炊具半机械化、吃水自流化、炉灶改良化）；在加工工具改革中，着重抓了粮食、棉花和红薯的加工。这几种工具的改革不仅可以节省大量的劳动力，而且带动了整个运动的开展。
    二、认真贯彻执行土法为主、土洋结合、自力更生、就地取材、因地制宜的方针，这是开展群众性炊具和加工工具改革运动的中心环节。事实证明，当前改制和创造的炊具和加工工具大量是土的。以土为主是适合我们当前的物质条件和技术条件的，它能发动全民大闹工具改革。以土为主不是不要洋的，在城市郊区和技术条件好的社也开始出现了洋的。炊具改革的发展规律同样是由土到洋，由简单到复杂，由个别工具的改革到系统成套，由半机械化到机械化。如我省石磨改良，是由原磨加滚珠轴承到一马拉多扇磨，再到木制面粉楼（杞县的木制面粉楼，动力带小钢磨）；红薯切片由手摇、脚蹬到马拉，一直到动力带；从单纯的切片机发展到粉碎、打粉的系统成套化。炊具和加工工具的改革所需要的物料，贯彻了就地取材，自力更生的方针。许昌专区在改良磨运动中，根据等价交换的原则，自筹了铁三十六万斤、木料一万多立方米。有的材料缺，尽量找代用品，如用布带代皮带，竹竿和陶瓷管代替钢铁管等。这样除国家只供应了少量的较高级的原材料外，绝大部分材料都依靠群众自筹解决了。
    三、组织技术队伍，加强技术指导，多快好省地开展炊具和加工工具改革运动。大规模的工具改革运动，需要很多技术力量。为了解决这一问题，各地普遍地采取了专业队伍和群众性的发明创造相结合的办法。新乡地区在实现炊具“四化”运动中，除发动群众献策献计，个个发明创造，人人动手以外，还调集了能工巧匠九万多名，组成了一万多个专业队，深入现场帮助群众创造、仿制、研究鉴定和推广群众所创造的产品，这就大大的加速了运动的开展。地方工业在技术上大力帮助，指派技术人员深入食堂进行指导。组织社与社、队与队、食堂与食堂大协作，采用请进来派出去的办法，解决技术上的困难。组织技术指导站和辅导团，以师带徒和办短期技术学校、训练班等方法，及时地培训了大批的新生技术力量。有的则以先进单位为学校，以先进炊具为教材，具体操作进行教学，以创造发明者为讲师来培训技术人员。由于采用了从实践中学习、在学习中实践的群众路线的方法，因而不仅顺利地解决了技术力量不足的困难，而且培养了大批的创造工具和使用工具的技术人员。同时，群众性的发明创造，必须与科学研究和及时选样定型相结合，将群众的发明创造及时地集中起来，经过科学选样定型，因地制宜地推广下去。既要作到边发明、边鉴定、边生产、边推广、边使用，又要在使用中再改进、再提高。只有如此，才能保证产品质量的不断提高，使运动迅速地向前发展。
