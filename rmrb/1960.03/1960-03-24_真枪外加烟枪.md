    Real Guns Plus Opium Pipes
    A Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Illustration by Hua Junwu
    Advisor, advisor,
    So deeply devoted. Caring is meticulous,
    "Aid" disregards all costs.
    Weapons of every kind are complete,
    Airplanes, missiles, atomic cannons;
    Narcotics of various types are numerous,
    Opium, heroin, morphine needles.
    Real guns are used to spearhead for America,
    Opium pipes can boost the spirit of the surviving soldiers.
    Complementing each other with infinite wonders,
    What distinction is there between smuggling and official transport?
    Who would have thought that a lackey would deliberately cause trouble,
    And a dignified Allied officer would act as a drug dealer.
    Why not stage a strategic retreat,
    To avoid the storm and carry on as before.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Taipei: The U.S. invading forces in Taiwan are using military aircraft to engage in smuggling and drug trafficking activities, transporting large quantities of narcotics from Japan, Hong Kong and other places to Taiwan.

    The news says that the Chiang gang's "Taiwan Provincial Police Department" announced on March 16 that the "major international aerial smuggling and drug trafficking group case" involving U.S. military personnel has been solved. Many pieces of evidence were "found in the residence of Jerome Miller, who served in the Air Force Group of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Taiwan." The criminal Jerome Miller confessed that "this smuggling and drug trafficking group started in the summer of 1957" and that "the total value of smuggling and drug trafficking was approximately US$751,200." The U.S. Military Advisory Group in Taiwan also admitted that "two U.S. military personnel" "used their positions to facilitate the private transportation of drugs" and that "they accepted a reward of $100 for each pound of drugs transported, bringing drugs (from Japan and Hong Kong) into Taiwan."

    The news says that now, the drug smuggling criminal Jerome Miller, under the protection of the American invading army, has fled to Tokyo, Japan, and is at large. (Attached picture)

    真枪外加烟枪
    池北偶诗　华君武画
    顾问，顾问，
    一往情深。关怀无微不至，
    “援助”不计血本。
    武器一应俱全，
    飞机、导弹、原子炮；
    毒品种类繁多，
    鸦片、白面、吗啡针。
    真枪用来替美国打头阵，
    烟枪可以使残兵提精神。
    相辅相成妙处无穷，
    分什么走私和公运？
    没想到奴才故意捣蛋，
    堂堂盟军官员当毒贩。
    干脆来一个金蝉脱壳，
    避过了这阵风照样干。
    新华社讯　台北消息：侵台美军利用军用飞机从事走私贩毒活动，把大批毒品从日本、香港等地运往台湾。
    消息说，蒋帮“台湾省警务处”3月16日宣布，由美国军人参加的“国际空中走私贩毒集团巨案”已经侦察破案。许多犯罪证物是在侵台“美军顾问团空军组任职的杰美密勒住宅中查获”的。罪犯杰美密勒供述，“此一走私贩毒集团自1957年夏天开始”，“走私及贩毒约计共值美金七十五万一千二百元”。侵台美军顾问团也承认，“两个美国军人”“利用职务上的方便私运毒品”，“他们曾接受以每运一磅毒品即获一百美元的酬劳，将毒品（由日本及香港）带进台湾”。
    消息说，现在，走私贩毒罪犯杰美密勒，在美国侵略军的保护下，已逃往日本东京，逍遥法外。（附图片）
