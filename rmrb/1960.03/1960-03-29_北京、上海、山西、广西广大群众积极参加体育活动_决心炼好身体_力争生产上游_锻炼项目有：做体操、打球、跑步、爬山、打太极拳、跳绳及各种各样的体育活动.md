Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: A spring mass sports campaign is sweeping through Beijing.

The vast numbers of workers on all fronts are responding enthusiastically to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, engaging in 20 minutes of sports activities centered around broadcast calisthenics or production exercises every day, a trend that has taken hold throughout the city. Even many street women and patients with chronic illnesses, who rarely came out to exercise in the winter, are now active in the warm sunshine doing exercises. Female workers at the Fusui Jing Civilian Lighting Fixture Processing Factory, led by their factory director, are all participating in exercise, except for pregnant women and patients. In addition to adhering to broadcast calisthenics, they also engage in shuttlecock kicking, rope skipping, tug-of-war and other sports. Units like this, where "everyone participates and everyone exercises," are constantly emerging.

Outdoor activities such as mountain climbing, boating, shooting, and model airplane flying are also very active. On Sundays, red scarf climbing team flags can already be seen flying on the Western Hills of Beijing's suburbs. On the lakes of Beihai, Zhongshan Park, and the Summer Palace, boating athletes are showing off their skills. In Chaoyang District, non-live ammunition shooting competitions with 50,000 participants have begun in conjunction with militia training.

Currently, under the leadership of the Party committees, all districts in the city have made preliminary plans for sports activities in April and May. Activities in various places are mostly centered around broadcast calisthenics, mobilizing more people to participate in various exercises, and conducting a series of ball games and track and field meets, pushing the spring sports campaign to a new climax.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 27th: A large-scale mass sports activity has unfolded in Shanghai. Currently, more than three million people regularly participate in various sports activities.

Every morning, from the green areas along the Bund, various parks, to the streets and alleys, there are groups of people practicing Tai Chi, long-distance running, and freehand exercises in the faint morning light. In the hundreds and thousands of sports venues throughout the city, various practice and competition activities continue all day long.

Under the leadership of the Party, Shanghai's mass sports movement has implemented the policy of serving labor production and national defense construction. The movement is developing more widely and deeply, and the people's physique is constantly being strengthened. After participating in sports activities, the more than 5,000 workers of the Meat United Processing Factory have become physically stronger, more energetic, and more motivated, and many have become pioneers in production and technological innovation. Seventeen young people from the Five-Star Production Team of Zhangze People's Commune in Songjiang County, who have persisted in physical exercise, are becoming increasingly healthy, and their labor efficiency in water conservancy construction has increased by 30% compared to the past.

Sports activities have also been carried out in densely populated downtown areas. In many buildings along Nanjing Road, employees and shop assistants engage in tug-of-war, shuttlecock kicking, and rope skipping in the corridors. They also use stairs as running tracks for symbolic mountain climbing exercises. Many small factories scattered in the alleys have also launched a variety of activities in their small spaces.

This newspaper reports: A mass sports movement involving millions of factory and mine workers, commune members, cadres, school teachers and students, and soldiers in Shanxi Province is becoming increasingly active. Currently, six million people in the province have participated in physical exercise activities, broadcast calisthenics have been popularized in more than 30 counties, more than one million people have met the standards of the Labor and Defense System at all levels, and more than 300,000 athletes and more than 200,000 ordinary shooters have emerged, along with 60 master athletes.

In vigorously carrying out mass sports activities, Shanxi Province has closely integrated them with labor production, which has not only strengthened the people's physique, but also more effectively promoted production. From the Party secretary and factory director to every worker and service staff member of the Xinjiang Textile Factory regularly insist on participating in various sports exercises. The health of the workers has been greatly improved, and occupational diseases have been basically eliminated. The sports exercise teams composed of young people as the backbone in Wanrong and Jishan counties have also become a strong shock force in production. They go to wherever the task is most difficult and excellently complete various production tasks.

The mass sports activities in Shanxi Province are diverse and tailored to local conditions and individual preferences. In addition to carrying out exercises around more than a dozen major items such as track and field, gymnastics, basketball, football, table tennis, and shooting, various places also engage in some activity programs with unique local styles according to local traditional customs, such as martial arts, track and field, and stone lock lifting, so that everyone can learn a set of fitness methods.

This newspaper reports: Guangxi has widely carried out various mass sports activities. At present, almost every commune and brigade in the entire autonomous region has basketball courts and teams, and many rural youths actively carry out various sports activities using production gaps, holidays, and festivals. The Zhonghe People's Commune in Donglan County, where the Zhuang people live, has a group of outstanding women's basketball team members who are not only brave generals on the court, but also skilled workers in production. Now, they are all good female commune members who are good at production, have good health, and are good at sports exercise. Before going to work every day, they always go to the court to high jump, long jump, and race. They also jump a few times when they rest in the fields. The Party Secretary of Limu Commune in Gongcheng County personally took the lead in participating in exercise, and the brigade and team cadres also grasped sports work. They have few sports supplies, so they use stones instead of shot puts, bamboo poles instead of javelins, and highways instead of tracks, and sports exercise has become a common practice throughout the commune.

After the widespread development of sports activities, the physique of the commune members has been strengthened, they are more energetic when working, and the relationship between various ethnic groups has been further improved. The Zhongnong Brigade of the Napo Commune in Mubian County has a militia company with 108 members of Zhuang, Han and other ethnic groups. After the development of sports activities, holiday life is very active. The situation of mutual non-communication between ethnic groups and between men and women in the past has been eliminated. Some women have also automatically changed their clothing that is inconvenient for production, and all ethnic groups are more closely united. (Attached picture)

    北京、上海、山西、广西广大群众积极参加体育活动
    决心炼好身体　力争生产上游
    锻炼项目有：做体操、打球、跑步、爬山、打太极拳、跳绳及各种各样的体育活动
    据新华社27日讯　北京正在掀起一个春季群众性体育锻炼热潮。
    各个战线上的广大职工们，精神焕发地响应市委提出的号召，每天进行二十分钟以广播操或生产操为中心的体育锻炼，已经在全市形成风气。连冬季里不常出来活动的许多街道妇女、慢性病患者，也活跃在和煦的阳光下做操。福绥境民用灯具加工厂的女职工在厂长带领下，除孕妇和病人外，都参加锻炼，她们除坚持广播操外，还进行踢毽子、跳绳、拔河等运动。像这样“全体出马，人人作操”的单位，正在不断出现。
    爬山、划船、射击、航空模型等野外活动也很活跃。星期天，北京郊区的西山上已有红领巾的爬山队旗飘扬。北海、中山公园、颐和园的湖面上，划船健儿正大显身手。朝阳区结合民兵训练，有五万人参加的射击竞赛的非实弹射击已经开始。
    现在，全市各个区在党委领导下，已经对4、5月份体育活动作了初步规划，各地活动大都以广播操为中心，发动更多人参加各种锻炼，并进行一系列球类、田径运动会，把春季体育锻炼推向新高潮。
    据新华社上海27日电　一个大规模的群众性体育活动，已经在上海展开。目前，经常参加各种体育活动的人数有三百万以上。
    每天清晨，从黄浦江边的绿化区域、各个公园，以至马路上、里弄中，到处都有成群结队的人，在晨光曦微中打太极拳、练习长跑、做徒手操等。全市成百上千的体育场所，各种练习、竞赛活动终日不断。
    上海市群众性的体育运动，在党的领导下，贯彻了为劳动生产、为国防建设服务的方针，运动开展得越来越广泛深入，人民的体质不断增强。肉类联合加工厂的五千多职工，参加体育活动以后，体质增强，精力更加充沛，干劲更足，许多人成了生产和技术革新中的闯将。松江县张泽人民公社五星生产队的十七个青年，坚持体育锻炼，身体越来越棒，在兴修水利时劳动效率比过去提高了30％。
    在人口密集的市中心区，也开展了体育活动。南京路两旁的许多大楼里，职工、店员们在走廊里拔河、踢毽子、跳绳，他们还以楼梯当跑道，作象征性爬山运动。分散在里弄中许多小型工厂，在狭小的场地内，也展开了多种多样的活动。
    本报讯　山西省由数百万厂矿职工、公社社员、机关干部、学校师生、部队官兵参加的群众性体育运动，日趋活跃。目前，全省有六百万人参加了体育锻炼活动，三十多个县普及了广播操，有一百余万人达到了劳卫制各级标准，并涌现出三十余万名等级运动员和二十余万名普通射手，六十个运动健将。
    山西省在大力开展群众性的体育运动中，由于紧密结合了劳动生产，不仅增强了人民的体质，而且更有力地推动了生产。新绛纺织厂从党委书记、厂长，到每个职工和服务人员经常坚持参加各种体育锻炼，职工的健康状况大大改善，基本上消灭了职业病。万荣、稷山两县以广大青年为骨干组成的体育锻炼队也成为生产上一支强有力的突击力量，他们看到哪里的任务最艰巨，就到那里去突击，出色地完成了各项生产任务。
    山西省群众性体育活动的项目多种多样，并作到了因地、因人，各取所好。各地除围绕着田径、体操、篮球、足球、乒乓球、射击等十几个主要项目进行锻炼外，还根据当地传统习惯，搞一些有地方独特风格的活动项目，如武术、田径、举石锁等，使人人都能学会一套健身法。
    本报讯　广西各地广泛开展了各种各样的群众性的体育活动。目前，全自治区各个公社、大队几乎都有了篮球场和球队，不少农村青年利用生产空隙、假日、节日，积极开展各种体育活动。僮族聚居的东兰县中和人民公社有一批出色的女子篮球队员，她们不仅是球场上的骁将，而且是生产上的能手。现在，她们都是社里生产好身体好体育锻炼好的女社员。她们每天出工前，总要到球场上跳高、跳远、赛跑。在田里休息时也要跳上几跳。恭城县栗木公社党委书记亲自带头参加锻炼，大队、小队干部也都抓体育工作，他们体育用品少，就用石头代铅球，竹竿代标枪，公路代跑道，全社体育锻炼成风。
    广泛开展体育运动后，社员体质增强了，干起活来更有劲，而且使各族社员之间的关系得到进一步的改善。睦边县那坡公社重农大队有一个基干民兵连，有僮、汉等族社员一百零八人，开展体育运动后，假日节日生活非常活跃，民族之间、男女之间过去互不往来的情况消除了，一些妇女把不方便生产的服装也自动改掉了，各民族更加亲密团结了。（附图片）
