Agricultural Technology Innovation Must Also "Form a Complete Set"
Abstract of *Dazhong Daily* Editorial, Shandong

The Qianshahai Production Team of the Chenji People's Commune in Chengwu County, through vigorous technological innovation and revolution, has basically achieved semi-mechanization and improved farm implements in the entire sweet potato production process. Various advanced tools "form a complete set," allowing them to fully exert their functions and increase the efficiency of all sweet potato production tasks by four times. This advanced experience is worthy of attention from all regions. Moving from single-item innovation to complete-set innovation, from single-item promotion of advanced experience to "comprehensive integration," from improving farm tools to semi-mechanization, this is a new development in the technological revolution movement on the agricultural production front.

The "complete set" integration of advanced tools and advanced experiences is a successful experience from the Great Leap Forward in the industrial front in recent years. The process of "complete set" integration and complete promotion of advanced tools and advanced experiences is also a process of making mass innovation and revolution popular and improved at a faster rate. By concentrating the diverse creations of the masses, comprehensively integrating them, conducting comparative research, evaluation, and appraisal to eliminate the crude and retain the refined, complement each other, continuously improve, and continuously elevate, we can enable the technological innovation and revolution movement to develop more deeply and extensively towards a higher level, and promote continuous leaps in production. At the same time, the result of "complete set" integration will inevitably make all production links mutually adapt, mutually promote, and comprehensively improve the level of production. From this, we can see that the experience of "comprehensive integration" is not just a specific working method issue, but an application of Chairman Mao's mass line of "from the masses, to the masses, concentrate, persevere."

Although the agricultural production process and the industrial production process are different, the plowing, sowing, weeding, and harvesting of a crop are also a unified production process that is interconnected and mutually influential. After the tools in one link are reformed, the other links need to adapt to it. Especially after the realization of people's communization, with the high concentration of production and great reforms in the farming system, large-scale high-yield areas of thousands and tens of thousands of mu have been universally established, and the planning and continuity of production have been greatly strengthened. Manual operation tools in many production processes have been replaced by semi-mechanized tools, modern tools, and various improved tools. In this situation, we should reform the tools of one operation into the tools of the entire process at a faster rate, and rapidly develop from the tool reform of one production process to a comprehensive tool reform, to achieve a comprehensive and high-speed leap in production. The reason why the work efficiency of the Qianshahai Production Team in planting and harvesting sweet potatoes has increased fourfold is that they have grasped the key to tool reform: "complete set" integration and comprehensive reform, making flat ridges compatible with ditching and ridging, and planting compatible with flat ridges; making transportation and harvesting compatible, and slicing compatible with transportation.

The key to doing a good job in the "complete set" integration of advanced tools and advanced experiences lies in strengthening Party leadership and vigorously developing mass movements. Party organizations at all levels must put the "comprehensive integration" work on the agenda and rapidly evaluate and appraise the existing creations of the masses to achieve complete promotion. This requires the implementation of the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, technical personnel, and peasant masses under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, implementing the mass line, concentrating the creations of the local masses, and widely absorbing advanced experiences from other places, so as to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

Currently, many regions are experiencing drought, and drought resistance to protect wheat and drought resistance for spring sowing have become the overriding central tasks in the rural areas of these regions. The technological innovation and revolution on the agricultural front must closely focus on drought resistance for spring sowing and drought resistance to protect wheat. First, the advanced tools and advanced experiences in this regard must be integrated into a complete set; at the same time, breeding tools, cooking tools, and the upcoming wheat harvesting tools must also be rapidly "integrated into a complete set" to further improve work efficiency, save labor, and create favorable conditions for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

    农业技术革新也要“配套成龙”
    山东大众日报社论摘要
    成武县陈集人民公社前沙海生产队，通过大搞技术革新与技术革命运动，使甘薯生产的整个过程，基本上实现了半机械化和农具改良化，各种先进工具
  “配套成龙”，得以充分发挥作用，使甘薯生产全套农活的工效提高四倍。这一先进经验，很值得各地重视。由单项革新到成套革新，由单项推广先进经验到“综合配套成龙”，由改良农具到半机械化，这是农业生产战线上技术革命运动的一个新发展。
    先进工具与先进经验的“配套成龙”，这是工业战线上在近年来大跃进中的一条成功经验。先进工具和先进经验的“配套成龙”和成套推广的过程，也是使群众的创造革新以更快的速度普及和提高的过程。把群众中多种多样的创造集中起来，综合配套，进行一番比较研究，评选鉴定，达到去粗取精，互相补充，不断改进，不断提高，就可以使技术革新与技术革命运动，越来越深入广泛地向更高的水平发展，促进生产持续跃进。同时，“配套成龙”的结果，也必然会使各个生产环节互相适应，互相推动，全面地提高生产水平。从这里，我们可以看到，“综合配套成龙”的经验，不只是一个具体工作方法问题，而是毛主席关于从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去的群众路线的运用问题。
    农业生产过程和工业生产过程虽然不同，但是，一项作物的耕、种、锄、割，也都是一个互相关联、互相影响的统一的生产过程。一个环节上的工具改旧换新之后，就需要其他环节与之相适应。特别是实现人民公社化后，生产高度集中，耕作制度有了很大改革，千亩万亩的大面积丰产方普遍地建立起来，生产的计划性和操作的连续性大大加强，许多生产工序中的手工操作工具，已经为半机械化工具、现代工具和各种改良工具所代替，在这种情况下，我们就应当以更快的速度，使一项操作的工具改革发展到整个工序的工具改革；从一个生产工序的工具改革，迅速发展为全面工具改革，实现生产的全面的高速度跃进。前沙海生产队从种植到收获甘薯的工效之所以提高了四倍，就是由于他们抓住了工具改革“配套成龙”、全面改革这个重要关键，使平垅与封沟起垅相适应，栽秧又与平垅相适应；使运输和收割相适应，切片又与运输相适应。
    搞好先进工具和先进经验“配套成龙”的关键，在于加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。各级党组织必须把“综合配套成龙”工作摆到议事日程上来，把现在群众中已有的创造，迅速地进行评比鉴定，做到成套的推广。这就必须在党委统一领导下，实行领导干部、技术人员、农民群众“三结合”，贯彻群众路线，既集中当地群众的创造，又广泛吸收外地的先进经验，这样才可达到多快好省。
    当前，许多地区发生旱象，抗旱保麦、抗旱春播已成为这些地区农村压倒一切的中心任务。农业战线上的技术革新与技术革命，必须紧紧围绕抗旱春播、抗旱保麦工作，首先要把这方面的先进工具和先进经验配起套来；同时，在饲养工具、炊事工具和即将到来的麦收工具，也要迅速“配套成龙”，进一步提高工效，节约劳力，为农业大丰收创造有利条件。
