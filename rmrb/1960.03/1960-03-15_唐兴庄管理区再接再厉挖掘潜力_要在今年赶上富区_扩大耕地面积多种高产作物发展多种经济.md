The Tangxingzhuang Management Area, a relatively low-production area in the Jicun People's Commune of Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, with the spirit of continuous revolution, is determined to transform from poor to rich within 1960 and catch up with the local wealthiest Nanpu Management Area.

The Tangxingzhuang Management Area has a large population but little land, with saline-alkali low-lying land accounting for one-third, and insufficient water sources. Over the years, the yield of grain and cotton has been very low. In 1959, with the help of the commune, the Tangxingzhuang Management Area chose the local wealthiest Nanpu Management Area as its target and launched a "learn from Nanpu, catch up with Nanpu" campaign to catch up with the rich. After a short year of hard work, the backward economic situation has changed significantly. The unit yield of grain in the entire management area increased by 30.6% compared to 1958. The per-mu yield of cotton increased by 22.6%. The average income per commune member was 75.2 yuan, and the income including family sideline production reached 85 yuan, an increase of 29% compared to 1958. After a recent summary evaluation, compared with the Nanpu Management Area, the average per-mu yield of grain was still 77 jin lower, cotton was 67 jin lower, and the average income of commune members was 21.3 yuan less.

After a comprehensive summary and analysis, the members of the Tangxingzhuang Management Area found that the subjective reasons for the backwardness were that the land was not fully and rationally utilized. The grain planting area was slightly smaller than in 1958. When arranging the crop planting ratio, there was a disadvantage of average land utilization, and there were not enough high-yield crops such as corn and alkali-resistant crops with great economic value were planted; In the struggle against saline-alkali damage, only palliative measures such as laying sand, replanting, and replanting were adopted, and a reasonable drainage and irrigation system was not established, the land was not leveled, and the water use system of flood irrigation was not reformed. As a result, the investment was large, the labor was high, the irrigation was less, and the serious lack of seedlings and broken ridges could not be eliminated; Only agriculture was grasped, and there was a lack of comprehensive and rational planning for multiple productions such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery; The development of animal husbandry production was also very slow, and large livestock were only used for service, and no attention was paid to breeding, resulting in empty pregnancies of female animals; There were also not many avenues for sideline production; The leadership was also relatively weak.

After a comprehensive analysis and recognition of their weaknesses, the members of the Tangxingzhuang Management Area put forward a set of guidelines for implementing both agricultural production and diversified operations; both grain and cash crops; both collective production and commune members' family sideline production; and both diligence and thrift. In terms of agricultural production, with the help of the commune, 566 mu of land were transferred from the Jicun Management Area this year, which solved the problem of large population and little land; The crop planting ratio has been reasonably adjusted, and the planting area of grain crops has been expanded by 34% compared with last year. Among them, the high-yield crop corn increased to 1,000 mu, which is nearly twice as large as last year; The replanting area of wheat should account for more than 70% of the total area, which greatly increases the utilization rate of the land. In addition, it is also planned to increase the planting of crops such as hemp, sunflower, fennel, and rapeseed, which have great economic value and are suitable for growing in alkaline land. While vigorously grasping agricultural production, actively develop multiple productions such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. They plan to manage orchards such as grapes and peach trees well, change the shortcomings of not paying attention to the breeding of large livestock, and ensure that all 26 eligible female animals are fully mated, fully pregnant, fully alive, and fully grown this year; The lambing rate of 205 eligible ewes will reach more than 95%, ensuring that there is one sheep for every three people; Vigorously run collective pig farms, rabbit farms, chicken farms, and duck farms to ensure that each person has two pigs, two chickens, five rabbits, and half a duck. This year, the income from animal husbandry will reach more than 52,700 yuan, accounting for 9.2% of the total income, an increase of more than 3.2 times compared with last year. Make full use of the local favorable conditions of more saline-alkali land and proximity to the mountains, and actively expand sideline productions such as earth salt, saltpeter, brine, weaving, and processing brooms; Expand and build wood factories, sewing factories, shoe factories, oil mills, vinegar houses, and engage in transportation in a big way, attracting wealth from all directions. Through this planned, proportional, purposeful, and step-by-step comprehensive implementation of the five industries, the total income of the entire management area can increase by 1.64 times compared with last year this year, and the average income per commune member can reach more than 166 yuan, an increase of more than one time compared with last year, and it can completely catch up with the local wealthiest Nanpu Management Area.

    唐兴庄管理区再接再厉挖掘潜力
    要在今年赶上富区
    扩大耕地面积多种高产作物发展多种经济
    本报讯　山西省汾阳县冀村人民公社生产水平比较低的唐兴庄管理区，本着不断革命的精神，决心要在1960年内由穷变富，赶上当地最富裕的南浦管理区。
    唐兴庄管理区人多地少，盐碱低洼地占了三分之一，水源也不足，历年来粮、棉产量都很低。1959年唐兴庄管理区在公社的帮助下，选择了当地最富裕的南浦管理区作为自己的追赶对象，掀起了“学南浦、赶南浦”穷赶富的热潮。经过短短一年的奋战，经济落后的面貌显著改变。全管理区粮食单位产量比1958年提高了30．6％。棉花亩产提高了22．6％。社员每人平均收入七十五元二角，连同社员家庭副业收入达八十五元，比1958年增长了29％。最近经过总结评比，与南浦管理区相比较，粮食平均亩产量还低七十七斤、棉花低六十七斤，社员平均收入相差二十一元三角。
    唐兴庄管理区社员们经过全面总结分析，找出了落后的主观原因是，在土地利用上不够充分合理，粮食种植面积比1958年稍有缩小，安排作物种植比例的时候，有平均利用土地的缺点，没有多种玉米等高产作物和经济价值大抗碱的作物；在与盐碱害作斗争中，仅采取铺沙、改种、补种等治标的办法，没有建立合理的排灌系统、平整土地、改革大水漫灌的用水制度，结果投资大，用工多，浇地少，严重的缺苗断垅仍无法杜绝；只抓农业，对林、牧、副、渔业等多种生产，缺泛全面合理的规划；畜牧生产发展也十分缓慢，大牲畜只顾使役，不注意繁殖，造成了母畜空怀；副业生产门路也不多；领导力量也比较薄弱。
    唐兴庄管理区的社员们，经过全面分析认清了自己的弱点以后，提出来贯彻既抓农业生产，又抓多种经营；既抓粮食又抓经济作物；既抓集体生产，又抓社员家庭副业生产；既抓勤，又抓俭一整套方针。在农业生产方面，今年在公社的帮助下，由冀村管理区调剂给土地五百六十六亩，解决了人多土地少的问题；作物种植比例作了合理调整，粮食作物的种植面积比去年扩大了34％。其中高产作物玉米增加到一千亩，比去年扩大了将近两倍；小麦的复播面积要占到总面积的70％以上，大大提高了土地的利用率。另外还计划增种经济价值大又适合碱地生长的大麻、向日葵、茴香、菜籽等作物。在大抓农业生产的同时，积极发展林、牧、副、渔业等多种生产。他们计划经营好葡萄、桃树等果木园，改变不注意繁殖大牲畜的缺点，今年二十六头适龄母畜保证全配、全怀、全成活、全长大；二百零五只适龄母羊产羔率达到95％以上，保证三个人平均有一只羊；大力举办集体养猪场、养兔场、养鸡场、养鸭场，保证每人有两口猪，两只鸡、五只兔和半只鸭。今年畜牧业的收入达到五万二千七百多元，占到总收入的9．2％，比去年提高三点二倍多。充分利用当地盐碱地多，靠山近的有利条件，积极扩大土盐、硝、卤水、编造、加工笤箒等副业生产；扩建和新建木厂、缝纫厂、制鞋厂、油坊、醋房、大搞运输，从四面八方招财进宝。通过这样有计划，按比例，有目的，有步骤地全面实行五业并举，今年全管理区生产的总收入可比去年增长一点六四倍，社员每人平均收入可达到一百六十六元以上，比去年增加一倍多，完全可以赶上当地最富裕的南浦管理区。　　（武赞庭）
