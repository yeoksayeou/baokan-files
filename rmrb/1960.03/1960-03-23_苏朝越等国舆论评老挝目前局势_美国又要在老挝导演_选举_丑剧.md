Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Various countries' public opinion has been commenting on the increasingly serious current situation in Laos.

TASS commentator Kharikov said on the 17th that the Lao Royal Army had launched new large-scale "mopping-up" operations in the southern region, and the entire Royal Army had been thrown into the "suppression" of patriotic forces. Although the election campaign has not officially started, the Lao reactionaries, supported by foreign countries, have already begun to play their tricks. In order to falsify the upcoming elections, the reactionaries have arbitrarily tampered with the election law, and most of the people will in effect be deprived of the right to vote.

The commentator pointed out that the Lao reactionaries intend to put a democratic fig leaf over themselves. The political tricks they are playing under the guise of holding National Assembly elections are primarily for foreign consumption. When a military coup took place in Laos this January, someone apparently reminded the organizers of the coup that it would be easier for them to establish a military dictatorship if they staged an election. It seems that this approach was also at the instigation of others. In any case, the startling coincidence of the talks between General White, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in the Pacific, and the General Staff of the Lao Royal Army, with the beginning of the "suppression" operations in many parts of Laos, gives reason to make this judgment. Kharikov said that the current Lao government has stated that it considers the upcoming elections to be a prelude to "national reconciliation." However, if the upcoming elections are a challenge to the Geneva Accords, if the elections are conducted under conditions of terror, and if someone wants to use the elections to turn the Lao National Assembly into a mouthpiece for a military dictator under U.S. protection, then what "national reconciliation" or peaceful settlement will there be in Laos?

"Democratic Korea" published a commentary on the 20th, condemning U.S. imperialism for intensifying its interference in Lao affairs as the Lao National Assembly elections (April) approach.

The commentary pointed out that the Lao reactionaries, following U.S. imperialism, are intensifying their "mopping-up" operations and persecuting progressive forces, illegally revising the election law, and carrying out other conspiracies in an attempt to manipulate the elections. The commentary said that the U.S. imperialist aggressors are now frantically trying to repeat in Laos the brutal "election" farce that was recently carried out in South Korea to maintain the puppet Lee Seung-man's "presidential" throne. The Korean people, together with the Lao people, must never allow such conspiracies by U.S. imperialism.

The commentary emphasized that U.S. imperialism's criminal acts of interference in Laos are a serious threat to the peace of Indochina and Asia, and a rude challenge to the people of this region. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs must immediately cease their actions against the Lao people and must immediately release Prince Souphanouvong and all other patriots who have been imprisoned.

The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 17th, accusing the Lao reactionary group of engaging in "dangerous collusion" with the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group in the military field. The commentary said that if the intervention of U.S. imperialism is not stopped in time, and if the collusion between the Lao extreme reactionary group and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to undermine the Geneva Accords is not stopped, then Laos will fall into an extremely dangerous situation.

The commentary pointed out that the Lao Royal Army is currently conducting large-scale "mopping-up" operations in Lower Laos. Many American-equipped corps are moving east along the Mekong River to slaughter the Lao people, in coordination with the Ngo Dinh Diem group's army's "mopping-up" operations along the Lao-Vietnamese border.

The commentary pointed out that this "mopping-up" operation by the Lao reactionary group is to prepare for the upcoming "general election," using bayonets and rifles to threaten the Lao people and force them to vote for their people. However, the purpose of the activities of the reactionary Lao militarists, at the instigation of U.S. imperialist interventionists, is not just this.

The Cambodian "Unity" newspaper said in a commentary on the upcoming elections in Laos on the 14th that this election is completely controlled by the Lao ruling group, which not only launched a civil war, but also illegally tampered with the Lao election law.

The newspaper pointed out that under these circumstances, the Lao Patriotic Front cannot nominate its candidates. Not only does this party not have freedom of activity, but because the party's leaders are still in prison, and some have had to flee or take up arms to defend themselves.

The newspaper pointed out that no one would think that this election, which is controlled by the ruling party, would have any meaning.

### 苏朝越等国舆论评老挝目前局势  美国又要在老挝导演“选举”丑剧

    苏朝越等国舆论评老挝目前局势
    美国又要在老挝导演“选举”丑剧
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论纷纷评论日趋严重的老挝目前局势。
    塔斯社评论员哈里科夫17日说，老挝王国军队在南部地区展开了新的、大规模的“扫荡”，全部王国军队都投入了对爱国力量的“讨伐”。虽然选举运动还未正式开始，但是受到外国支持的老挝反动派早已开始耍弄他们的花招。反动分子为了伪造即将举行的选举，私自篡改了选举法，大多数人民实际上将被剥夺选举权。
    评论员指出，老挝反动派在打算给自己盖上一层民主的遮羞布。他们在举行国民议会选举的幌子下所耍的政治把戏，首先是耍给国外看的。当今年1月老挝发生军事政变的时候，显然有人提醒过政变的组织者：如果演一出选举剧，将会更便于他们建立军事独裁统治。看样子，这样做法也是出于别人的唆使。无论如何，像美国驻太平洋地区陆军总司令怀特和老挝王国军队总司令部的会谈同老挝许多地区“讨伐”行动的开始这样惊人地巧合，使人有理由作出这种判断。哈里科夫说，老挝现政府曾经声明说，它认为即将举行的选举是达到“全国和解”的前奏。但是，如果即将举行的选举是对日内瓦协议的挑战，如果选举在恐怖的情况下进行，如果有人想借助选举把老挝国民议会变成在美国庇护下的军事独裁者的传声筒，那么，在老挝还会有什么“全国和解”或和平调解可言呢？
    “民主朝鲜报”20日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义在老挝国民议会选举（4月）临近时，更加加紧了对老挝事务的干涉。
    评论指出，老挝反动分子追随美帝国主义加紧进行“扫荡”和迫害进步力量，非法地修改了选举法，并且进行其他阴谋，以图操纵选举。评论说，美帝国主义侵略者现在疯狂地又要在老挝重演像不久前在南朝鲜所进行的维护李承晚傀儡“总统”宝座那样的残暴的“选举”丑剧。朝鲜人民同老挝人民一起决不能容许美帝国主义的这种阴谋活动。
    评论强调说，美帝国主义对老挝的罪恶的干涉行为，是对印度支那和亚洲和平的严重威胁，也是对这个地区人民的粗暴挑战。美帝国主义和它的走狗必须立即停止反对老挝人民的行为，必须立即释放被监禁的苏发努冯亲王等一切爱国者。
    越南“人民报”17日发表评论，指责老挝反动集团正在同美国—吴庭艳集团进行军事上的“危险的勾结”。评论说，如果不及时制止美帝国主义的干涉，制止老挝极端反动的集团同吴庭艳集团为破坏日内瓦协议而进行的勾结，那末，老挝将会陷入极其危险的境地。
    评论指出，目前老挝王国军队正在下寮大举“扫荡”。许多美式装备的兵团正在沿着九龙江向东蠢动屠杀老挝人民，以配合吴庭艳集团的军队沿着老越边境进行的“扫荡”。
    评论指出，老挝反动集团的这种“扫荡”，是为了给即将举行的
  “大选”作准备，利用刺刀和枪杆向老挝人民进行威胁，迫使老挝人民给他们的人投票。但是，反动的老挝军阀主义分子在美帝国主义干涉者的唆使下所进行的勾当，其目的不只是这一点。
    柬埔寨“统一报”14日在评论老挝即将举行的选举时说，这次选举完全是由老挝统治集团一手包办的，他们不仅发动了内战，而且还非法篡改了老挝的选举法。
    这家报纸指出，在这种情况下，老挝爱国战线党不可能提出它的候选人。这个党不仅没有活动的自由，而且由于这个党的领袖们还被关在监狱中，还有一些也不得不逃亡或者拿起武器进行自卫。
    这家报纸指出，谁也不会认为，在执政党包办下举行这次选举会有任何意义。
