Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 11th - Cambodia's "Unity Daily" said today that peace-loving people welcome the upcoming meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru. The newspaper expressed its belief that this meeting will bring the relationship between the Chinese and Indian people closer. The newspaper recalled that since the Sino-Indian border dispute arose, imperialists and reactionaries have spared no effort to intensify and expand the dispute in order to undermine Sino-Indian friendship. Some Indian reactionaries even incited the Indian government to declare war on China. Imperialists also attempted to undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and change the neutral course of some Asian and African countries.

The newspaper said that, finally, Nehru accepted Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for negotiations. The newspaper expressed its firm belief that this meeting will bring the relationship between the Chinese and Indian people closer.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Helsinki News: The "People's News," the organ of the Finnish People's Democratic League, recently published an editorial on the upcoming talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India on the border issue between the two countries, pointing out that the holding of these talks is the result of China's unremitting efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the issue.

The editorial praised Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru at the end of February, saying that the letter "excellently demonstrated China's willingness to seek reconciliation." It also said: China's restraint is "based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and also on the idea that Asians themselves should solve Asian problems."

The editorial criticized the United States for "trying its best to undermine Asian-African solidarity" and pointed out that the United States is trying to sow discord between China and other Asian countries. It said: "The United States is not indifferent to the development of China's relations with its neighbors."

The editorial pointed out: "Resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute is not an easy task, because this border, which is more than two thousand kilometers long, has never been precisely defined. In addition, the influence of Britain's past colonial rule over India can still be seen in this issue. (However,) if both sides show goodwill, the dispute can be resolved."

The editorial finally emphasized: "If the two sides of the highest-level Sino-Indian meeting follow the spirit of peaceful coexistence and Bandung, then tensions can be eased. The recent border agreement between China and Burma is a good example in this regard."

    柬埔寨“统一报”
    欢迎中印两国总理会晤
    芬兰“人民新闻”赞扬周总理复信
    新华社金边11日电　柬埔寨“统一报”今天说，爱好和平的人民都欢迎周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理即将会晤。这家报纸表示相信，这次会晤将使中印两国人民的关系更加密切。这家报纸回顾说，自从发生中印边界争端以来，帝国主义和反动派不遗余力地企图加剧和扩大这一争端，以便破坏中印友谊。印度某些反动分子甚至鼓动印度政府向中国宣战。帝国主义还企图破坏和平共处五项原则，改变一些亚非国家的中立路线。
    这家报纸说，最后，尼赫鲁接受了周恩来总理提出的进行谈判的建议。这家报纸表示深信，这次会晤将使中印两国人民的关系更加密切。
    新华社11日讯　赫尔辛基消息：芬兰人民民主联盟机关报“人民新闻”最近就中国和印度两国总理即将就两国边界问题举行会谈一事发表社论，指出这次会谈的得以举行是中国方面为谋求问题的和平解决而不懈努力的结果。
    社论赞扬周恩来总理在2月底给印度总理尼赫鲁的复信，说这封信“极好地表明了中国谋求和解的意愿”。它还说：中国方面的克制态度是“基于和平共处的原则，也是基于亚洲人自己应该解决亚洲问题的观念”。
    社论抨击美国“正在竭力破坏亚非团结”，并且指出美国在竭力挑拨离间中国同其他亚洲国家的关系。它说：“在关于中国同它的邻国关系的发展上，美国并不是不过问的。”
    社论指出：“解决中印边界纠纷不是一件轻而易举的事情，因为这条有两千多公里长的边界从来没有精确地划定过，此外，在这个问题中仍然可以看到英国过去对印度的殖民统治的影响。（但是，）如果双方表现出善意，纠纷是能够解决的。”
    社论最后强调说：“如果中印最高级会议的双方遵循和平共处和万隆精神，那么紧张是可以缓和的。中国和缅甸之间最近的边界协定，就是这方面的一个良好榜样”。
