Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th — West German Chancellor Adenauer met with Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke on the 26th. According to reports, they discussed strengthening "cooperation" between Tokyo and Bonn, opposing a summit meeting, and carrying out economic expansion into underdeveloped countries.

    According to a Tokyo radio report, Adenauer said to Kishi Nobusuke during the meeting that "the threat of international communism still exists" and that "the unity of the liberalist camp must be further strengthened."

    Referring to the upcoming East-West summit meeting, Adenauer said, "It is inconceivable that international tensions can be eased by holding only one or two summit talks." Kishi Nobusuke expressed his "agreement" with Adenauer's remarks.

    Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke also reached a consensus on the issue of West Germany and Japan jointly carrying out economic expansion into underdeveloped countries.

    At a press conference held after his meeting with Kishi Nobusuke, Adenauer said that West Germany and Japan should "strengthen cooperation politically and economically in order to resist the threat of communism."

    When asked about the disarmament issue, Adenauer said: "Disarmament is only possible when you are strong, not weak." Adenauer also threatened that if the Soviet Union did not accept the United States' so-called "Open Skies" proposal at future disarmament conferences, it would "only face the continued expansion of armaments by Western countries."

    In answering reporters' questions, Adenauer exposed the political aims of his and Kishi Nobusuke's talk about economic "aid" to underdeveloped countries. He said that "economic aid programs must be considered more from a political perspective than just an economic one."

    阿登纳岸信介臭味相投
    反对最高级会议　对外进行经济扩张
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：西德总理阿登纳26日同日本首相岸信介举行了会谈。据报道，他们在会谈中讨论了加强东京—波恩之间的“合作”、反对最高级会议、以及向不发达国家进行经济扩张等问题。
    据东京电台报道，阿登纳在会谈中对岸信介说，“国际共产主义的威胁仍然存在”，“必须进一步加强自由主义阵营的团结”。
    在谈到不久将举行的东西方首脑会议时，阿登纳说，“不能设想只举行一两次首脑会谈，国际紧张局势就能得到缓和”。岸信介对阿登纳的谈话表示“同意”。
    阿登纳和岸信介还在西德和日本共同向不发达国家进行经济扩张问题，取得了一致意见。
    阿登纳在同岸信介会谈后举行的记者招待会上说，西德和日本为了“抵抗共产主义的威胁，两国要在政治上和经济上加强合作”。
    当记者问到有关裁军问题时，阿登纳说：“只有在你是强大而不是弱小的时候，裁军才有可能”。阿登纳还威胁说，在未来的裁军会议上，如果苏联不接受美国的关于所谓“开放天空”的建议，它就“只有面对西方国家继续扩军”。
    阿登纳在回答记者问题时暴露了他和岸信介所谈论的对不发达国家进行经济“援助”的政治目的。他说，“经济援助计划必须多从政治角度而不是只从经济角度来考虑”。
