    Zhangshu Commune Focuses on Canteens to Comprehensively Arrange Life
    All "Three Category Canteens" Eliminated in the Commune; Members Eat Well, Economically, and Satisfied.
    Laundry and Sewing Service Organizations Established Centered on Canteens, Enabling Members to Concentrate on Production
    (Our Dispatch) The Zhangshu Commune in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, while vigorously grasping spring plowing production, mobilized the entire Party to comprehensively and meticulously arrange the lives of commune members, focusing on grain and canteens. This further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the commune members and pushed spring plowing production to a new high tide.
    Because the lives of commune members were well arranged, the masses had great enthusiasm. The number of people working in the entire commune every day reached more than 25,000. The 48,130 mu of paddy fields averaged 765 dan of fertilizer per mu, and the fertilizer accumulation efficiency increased from the original 80 dan per person per day to 120 to 150 dan. More than 24,400 mu of fields were plowed three times and harrowed four times, and more than 35,000 mu of green manure and spring-harvested crops were generally cultivated and fertilized two to five times, greatly promoting the development of spring plowing and large-scale production.
    With the continuous leap forward in production and the people's communization, this commune has achieved bumper harvests year after year. Not only has grain production increased, but animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed accordingly, and the living standards of the vast number of commune members have significantly improved. After communization, the entire commune formed 739 canteens and generally established kindergartens. The vast number of women participated in production, and household labor was basically socialized. According to the instructions of the higher Party committee to "grasp production with one hand and life with the other," the commune Party committee believed that arranging the lives of commune members was an important task at present, and decided to comprehensively arrange firewood, cooking oil, vegetables, medical and health care, etc., focusing on grain and canteens. The grain department adopted the method of "one pole to the end," uniting "collection, management, and use" into one rope. Of the 36,060,000 jin of grain harvested by the entire commune last year, in addition to the requisitioned grain, in the spirit of "looking ahead and behind, using abundance to make up for scarcity, continuous flow, and leaving room," the commune members' food grain, seed grain, feed grain, and reserve grain were uniformly arranged, and were stored separately and used for special purposes. According to the principle of "unified grain management, monthly grain distribution, quantitative allocation per person, quotas to households, grain to the canteen, and surplus returned to the individual" stipulated by the provincial Party committee, the production brigade uniformly controlled the grain management authority, and specifically adopted the "four unifications and one fixation" management method of "unified storage, unified arrangement, unified processing, unified system, and fixed personnel management." A number of warehouses were built with the brigade as a unit, concentrating the past 1,300 scattered warehouses into 369; the income and expenditure system was further tightened, cards were set up for each warehouse, warehouses were sealed and locked, and grain was issued with one scale. For the food grain of commune members, according to the spirit of "eat more during busy farming seasons, eat less during slack farming seasons, have both dry and thin food, and mix grain and vegetables," the grain consumption quota was determined to households and grain to the canteen. In particular, from spring plowing production to this year's new harvest, the monthly grain consumption was comprehensively arranged, so that commune members could eat their fill, eat well, and eat economically.
    In order to arrange the people's lives centered on grain, the commune Party committee and the grain department prominently grasped the key link of running the canteen well. They adopted the method of running "grain schools" to train grain processors and custodians in batches, so that they could learn grain processing, storage techniques, and improve cooking methods. Three thousand and fifty people have been trained so far. After training, the cooking skills of the cooks have been significantly improved. In order to take care of the different needs of the elderly, children, patients, and pregnant women, each canteen has both dry and thin food for each meal, which is very convenient for the commune members. In order to save grain and plan grain use, they established a system of "quotas to households and surplus returned to the individual." From November last year to February this year, the commune members saved more than 120,000 jin of food grain. In order to enable commune members to eat better during the spring plowing season, the entire commune combined cadres going deep into the work groups to implement each cadre contracting to run a canteen well, requiring not only good leadership in production, but also running the canteen well. While running the canteen well, they firmly grasped the method of growing more vegetables and eating more vegetables to adjust meals and improve life. The entire commune extracted 790 people to cultivate and manage the existing 8,900 mu of vegetable gardens, so that each canteen had a vegetable plot. On the other hand, measures were taken to seize every opportunity to launch a mass melon and vegetable planting campaign. Now, more than 5,000 mu of melons and vegetables are planted using open spaces. Because the vegetables are full of gardens, 562 of the 739 canteens in the entire commune can eat more than three jin of fresh vegetables per person per day, and the remaining canteens can also eat more than two jin. Due to the above measures, of the 739 canteens in the entire commune, 229 are classified as Category One and 510 are classified as Category Two. There are no Category Three canteens in the entire commune.
    The commune Party committee considered that it is easy to get sick in the spring. In order to protect the health of the commune members, the 48 medical personnel of the entire commune were organized into medical and prevention teams to go deep into the fields to carry out medical and prevention work. Because women are working, there is no time for household labor such as sewing clothes, washing clothes, making shoes, and mending socks. Many canteens organize women who are not suitable for field work to wash clothes, make shoes, and sew and mend clothes and socks. For example, after the shoe-making group of the No. 9 production team of Longtan Brigade was established, all 35 women who could go to the fields were able to work. The commune Party committee also made arrangements in terms of cultural entertainment.
    The reason why this commune has made good arrangements for the lives of its members is because the leaders attach importance to it. The county Party committee paid attention to grasping the arrangement of the lives of commune members when arranging to grasp production. The commune also established a life welfare office, which is specifically responsible by a secretary. Every meeting of the commune pays attention to studying and arranging the living problems of the commune members, and also requires all departments to combine their own work and do everything possible to serve production and the lives of the commune members. For example, the grain department regards grasping the grain use of the canteen as a regular task and sends cadres to the canteen; the supply and marketing cooperative transports enough fuel needed by the commune members every month, and processes pickles for the canteen, and supplies the canteen with soy sauce, tempeh and other seasonings every month according to the plan. In order to better serve the commune members, shops and service departments have improved their service methods. In addition to extending the service hours of the stores, they have also set up service counters to sew buttons and do sewing and mending for free; they have also organized a dozen hawkers to deliver goods to the courtyards and fields in separate packages. The financial department also helps commune members plan their money and carry out savings. All departments closely revolve around the central work of the Party and serve production and life.

    樟树公社以食堂为重点全面安排生活
    全社消灭了“三类食堂”，社员吃得好、吃得节省、吃得满意
    以食堂为中心成立洗衣、缝补服务组织，使社员安心生产
    本报讯　湖南省湘阴县樟树公社在大抓春耕生产的同时，全党动手，以粮食为中心，以食堂为重点，全面细致地安排社员生活，进一步激发了社员生产的积极性，把春耕生产推向了一个新的高潮。
    由于对社员生活安排得好，群众干劲很大，全公社每天出工人数达到二万五千多人；四万八千一百三十亩稻田，平均每亩积肥已达七百六十五担，积肥工效由原来每人每天八十担上升到一百二十担至一百五十担；二万四千四百亩田作到了三犁四耙，三万五千多亩绿肥和春收作物普遍进行了二至五次中耕追肥，大大地促进了春耕大生产的开展。
    随着生产持续跃进和人民公社化以来，这个公社获得连年大丰收，不仅粮食增产，牧、副、渔业也相应的有了大发展，广大社员生活水平显著提高。公社化后，全社组成了七百三十九个食堂，普遍地成立了幼儿园，广大妇女参加了生产，家务劳动基本社会化。公社党委根据上级党委提出的“一手抓生产、一手抓生活”的指示，认为安排好社员的生活是当前的一项重要工作，决定以粮食为中心，以食堂为重点，对烧柴、食油、蔬菜、医疗卫生等等，全面进行安排。粮食部门采取了“一竿子插到底”的办法，把“收、管、用”拧成一股绳。对全社去年收获的三千六百零六万斤粮食，除征购粮外，本着“瞻前顾后，以丰补歉，细水长流，留有余地”的精神，把社员口粮、种子粮、饲料粮、储备粮等统一进行了安排，实行分仓保管、专粮专用。并根据省委规定的“粮食统管，按月发粮，以人定量，指标到户，粮食到堂，节余归己”的原则，由生产大队统一掌握粮食管理权限，同时具体采用了“统一储存、统一安排、统一加工、统一制度，固定专人管理”的“四统一定”的管理办法，以大队为单位建了一批仓库，把过去分散的一千三百多处仓库集中成为三百六十九处；进一步严格了收支领发制度，逐仓设立卡片，封仓落锁，坚持一杆秤发粮。对于社员口粮，根据“农忙多吃，农闲少吃，有干有稀，粮菜混吃”的精神，确定用粮指标到户，粮食到堂，特别是从春耕生产到今年接新止，对每月用粮全面进行了安排，使社员既吃得饱，吃得好，又吃得省。
    为了安排好以粮食为中心的人民生活，公社党委和粮食部门突出地抓住办好食堂这一环节。他们采用开办“粮校”的办法，分批轮训粮食加工员、保管员，使他们学会粮食加工、保管技术和改进烹调方法，前后已训练了三千零五十人。经过训练，炊事员烹调技术有了显著的提高。各个食堂为了照顾老、幼、病人、孕妇等不同情况的需要，每餐饭有干有稀，社员都感到很方便。为了节约用粮，计划用粮，他们建立了“指标到户，节余归己”的制度，从去年11月到今年2月，全社社员共节余下来口粮十二万多斤。为了使社员春耕期间吃得更好，全公社结合干部深入作业组，实行每个干部包干办好一个食堂，要求不但领导好生产，还一定要办好食堂。在办好食堂的同时，他们紧紧抓住了多种蔬菜、多吃蔬菜这一调剂伙食、改善生活的方法，全社共抽出七百九十人对现有的八千九百亩菜园进行培育管理，使每个食堂都有一片菜地。另一方面采取见缝插针的办法，发动群众性的扩种瓜菜运动。现在利用空坪隙地种的瓜菜就有五千多亩。由于蔬菜满园青，全社七百三十九个食堂中就有五百六十二个每天每人可吃三斤以上的鲜菜，其余的食堂也吃到二斤以上。由于采取以上措施，全社七百三十九个食堂中，划为一类的有二百二十九个、二类的五百一十个，全社已没有三类食堂了。
    公社党委考虑到春天容易生病，为了保护社员身体健康，把全社四十八个医务人员分别组成医疗预防队，深入田间进行医疗预防工作。由于妇女出工，没有时间进行缝衣、洗衣、做鞋、补袜子等家务劳动，不少食堂把不适合田间劳动的妇女组织起来，洗衣、做鞋和缝补衣袜。如龙潭大队九生产队做鞋组成立后，使三十五个能下田的妇女全部出工了。在文化娱乐方面，公社党委也进行了安排。
    这个公社对社员生活所以安排得好，是因为领导重视。县委在布置抓生产时，注意抓社员生活安排，公社还成立了生活福利办公室，由一位书记专门负责。公社每次会议，都注意研究安排社员生活问题，也要求各部门结合本身的工作，千方百计地为生产服务，为社员生活服务。如粮食部门把抓好食堂用粮作为一项经常工作，派干部深入食堂；供销部每个月都运足社员需要的燃料，并为食堂加工酱菜，每月按计划供应各食堂酱油、豆豉等调料。商店和服务部门为了更好地为社员服务，改进了服务方法，除门市部延长服务时间外，还设立了服务台，无偿代缝衣扣、缝缝补补等；还组织了十几副货郎担，分片包干送货到屋场、到田间。金融部门还帮助社员计划用钱，开展储蓄。各部门都紧紧围绕党的中心工作，为生产为生活服务。（附图片）
