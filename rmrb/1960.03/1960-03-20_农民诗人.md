　　Peasant Poet

　　When people mention Zhang Quanlai, a member and labor model of the Taodong People's Commune in Tao'an County, Baicheng Prefecture, they all praise him as a peasant poet.

　　Zhang Quanlai used to be an uneducated and suffering person. After liberation, Zhang Quanlai was emancipated, had houses and land, and had enough to eat and wear. Only then did he begin to learn culture painstakingly. He took books to the fields, wrote during breaks, and stayed up late at night with a bean oil lamp to read. Sometimes he didn't sleep until very late. In this way, in less than two years, Zhang Quanlai could write letters and keep accounts. At this time, Zhang Quanlai couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart and began to write poetry. The branch secretary also encouraged him to compose, write, and sing more. From then on, Zhang Quanlai had even more enthusiasm for writing poetry. He looked for themes while working, composed poems whenever he saw something new, and then sang them to everyone. During the drought, he composed a poem and sang: "The people of Taodong have high aspirations, take the Taohe River as a water ladle, not afraid of the sky not raining, we will irrigate wherever it is dry."

　　During the time of vigorously developing people's communes, Zhang Quanlai also composed poems to sing the praises of the people's communes: "The commune is like a cornucopia, the pot is filled with happy people, everyone works together to run the commune, and black soil can be turned into gold."

　　The peasant poet Zhang Quanlai is like this, engaging in production on the one hand and actively creating on the other. In the past few years, he has composed more than a thousand poems.

    农民诗人
    提起白城专区洮安县洮东人民公社社员、劳动模范张权来，人们都称赞他是个农民诗人。
    张权过去也是没有文化的受苦的人。解放后，张权翻了身，有了房子和土地，吃穿有余，这才开始苦心地学文化。他下地带书，歇工就写，夜间回家点起豆油灯就看，有时候夜间很晚还不睡。这样，不到二年，张权就能写信记账了。这时，张权压抑不住内心的激动，就开始编写诗歌。支部书记也鼓励他多编多写多唱。从此，张权编诗歌的劲头更足了。他一面干活一面找题材，见着新的事就编，然后就给大家唱。抗旱的时候，他编出诗歌唱道：“洮东人民志气豪，拿起洮河当水瓢，不怕老天不下雨，那块旱来那块浇。”
    在大办人民公社的时候，张权又编诗歌来歌唱人民公社：“公社好似聚宝盆，盆里装满幸福人，大家齐心办公社，黑土都能变成金。”
    农民诗人张权，就是这样一面搞生产，一面积极创作。几年来，他共编了一千多首诗歌。
