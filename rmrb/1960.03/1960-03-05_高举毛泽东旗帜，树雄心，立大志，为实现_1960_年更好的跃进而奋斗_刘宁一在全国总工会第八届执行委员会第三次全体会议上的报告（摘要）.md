We are facing an unprecedentedly excellent situation. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, China's working class, peasant masses, revolutionary intellectuals, and all working people are united and have achieved a great victory in the continuous leap forward of 1959, based on the great leap forward of 1958, completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule; especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, the people of the whole country have been working with soaring fighting spirit and selfless labor, launching an unprecedentedly high tide of the movement to increase production and practice economy, making China's socialist construction enter a new stage of high-speed development. With the rapid development of socialist construction, the three magic weapons for building socialism proposed by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong—the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune—are increasingly showing their infinite power and proving to be incomparably correct and great. The broad masses of workers and the people of the whole country love the Party and Chairman Mao even more, and have a greater understanding that Mao Zedong Thought is a weapon that is invincible and conquers all. The working masses of our country and the people of the whole country firmly believe that with the three magic weapons, we will definitely be able to accelerate socialist construction and create conditions for the future transition from socialism to communism.

Currently, a magnificent situation of prosperity and comprehensive development is emerging in all regions and all aspects of the country. The mass workers' movement is also developing vigorously.

Through the efforts of workers across the country, 1960 began with an unprecedentedly good start on all fronts, completing the January production plan ahead of schedule. Not only did output continue to rise, but also quality, variety, cost, labor productivity, and other indicators exceeded the plan, continuing to show a new atmosphere of comprehensive leap forward.

In the continuous leap forward of the national economy, the mass movements of technological revolution and cultural revolution are advancing rapidly. On the industrial, capital construction, transportation, and financial and trade fronts, the broad masses of workers have given full play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and have begun to strive for the large-scale realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual labor and automation and semi-automation of mechanical operation. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on China's industrial front has also converged with the technical transformation movement on the agricultural front, becoming a nationwide torrent of technical revolution. While carrying out the technical revolution, the country has also launched a high tide of cultural revolution. The broad masses of workers are setting lofty aspirations and boosting their energy, learning culture and science and technology. Cultural, educational, and scientific research personnel across the country are also closely combining with the production front, improving their work, working hard to study, and striving to climb the peak of science and culture.

After two years of continuous leap forward, the communist consciousness of the working masses in our country has reached an unprecedented height. In enterprises, cadres, workers, and technicians are even more united as one. Communist cooperation is developing more and more extensively. The collectivist spirit of the working masses has greatly increased, the communist style has been greatly promoted, and a large number of advanced collectives and advanced producers have emerged. The socialist competition of comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward is even more in full swing than ever before.

All of the above shows that the working masses of our country have been more closely united and organized under the red banner of the Party's General Line, and are working with the people of the whole country, with the spirit of continuous revolution and the lofty aspirations of the proletariat, determined to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in the next ten years; basically establish China's complete industrial system; basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture in our country, and build our country into a powerful socialist country.

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations at all levels in our country have cooperated closely with relevant parties, resolutely implemented the Party's General Line, actively and proactively responded to the Party's call, and completed the tasks assigned by the Party. In the mass work centered on production, combining production, life, and education, the vast majority of trade union cadres have gone deep into production and among the masses, enabling trade union organizations to play the role of a communist school and become a strong assistant to the Party.

In 1960, under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations must hold high the banner of Mao Zedong even higher, continue to implement the Party's General Line, deeply mobilize and unite the entire working masses to foster lofty aspirations, with the spirit of continuous revolution and the noble communist style, comprehensively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, vigorously support agricultural technical transformation, deeply carry out cultural revolution, comprehensively organize economic life, and ensure the continuous rise of production. We must complete the national plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and achieve a continued great leap forward in the national economy.

1.  Extensively Carry Out the Movement to Study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's Works

Mao Zedong Thought is a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the revolution, and it is a sharp weapon to guide China's revolution and socialist construction to continuous victory. Comrade Mao Zedong combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the creative spirit of the people, and his works have enriched the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. Our Party's experience fully proves that Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, will become a huge material force. Therefore, trade union organizations must, under the leadership of the Party, extensively carry out the movement to study Marxism-Leninism and study Mao Zedong's works among the working masses, so that the broad masses of workers can master and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all actions and work.

To enable the broad masses of workers to master Mao Zedong Thought, the first thing to do at present is to further publicize the three magic weapons for building socialism in our country. The three magic weapons are the great product of Chairman Mao's creative combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions, and they are a major contribution to Marxism-Leninism. The current socialist education movement on all fronts mainly aims to enable the broad masses of workers to further understand the great significance of the three magic weapons, further draw a clear line between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, more consciously use the three magic weapons, accelerate socialist construction, and enable the working masses to more deeply understand Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of combining continuous revolution with the theory of the stages of revolutionary development guides us to develop from one revolutionary stage to another at the right time, and from one victory to another. We must repeatedly publicize Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of continuous revolution to the working masses, educate the working masses with the situation and tasks of the 1960s and the great ideal of communism, so that they not only fully understand the current situation, but also fully recognize the great future, have the determination to realize the current tasks, and have lofty ideals, constantly struggle, and move forward forever.

The most important purpose of studying Mao Zedong Thought is to understand the world and transform the world with the proletarian world outlook, and to transform oneself while transforming the world. After the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and after the socialist education movement, the broad masses of workers have shown an unprecedentedly high surge of communist spirit. "Leave the difficulties to yourself, give the convenience to others," "Go to the difficulties, give up the honors, learn from the advanced, help the backward" are concrete manifestations of the high communist consciousness of the working masses. This is the mainstream of the current workers' thought. However, the domestic bourgeoisie in our country has not been completely eliminated. At the same time, with the increasing development of construction, people from peasant and petty-bourgeois backgrounds and even elements from exploiting classes have successively entered the ranks of the working class. Therefore, bourgeois ideology and various non-proletarian ideologies will often invade the ranks of the working class. Therefore, we must constantly promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology among the working masses, establish communist ideology, break individualism, and enable the broad masses of workers to establish a firm proletarian world outlook, muster their energy, strive for the top, and continuously push the mass movement forward, so that socialist construction will continue to leap forward.

From practice, the broad masses of workers in our country have fully realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth and is the guarantee for the continuous victory of our cause. They are all eager to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and have launched a movement to study Mao Zedong's works with great enthusiasm. This movement is a popularization movement of Marxism-Leninism, which will greatly improve the political consciousness and ideological level of the working masses, promote the development of Marxism-Leninism, and will have an extremely far-reaching impact on China's socialist and communist cause. Under the leadership of the Party, the trade union must cooperate with the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and other parties to carry out this movement more extensively.

2.  Comprehensively Carry Out the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement Centered on Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization

At present, the broad masses of workers across the country are vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization. Workers in many enterprises have also gradually realized the linkage production line, single-machine automation, and automatic production line based on the original equipment. China's technical innovation and technical revolution have entered a new stage.

Vigorously promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization can accelerate the technological transformation of enterprises and promote the continuous leap forward of China's national economy. After ten years of construction, China's material and technical foundation and scientific research work have been greatly strengthened, and the cultural and technical level of workers has been greatly improved. Especially after breaking superstition and emancipating the mind, the communist style has been greatly improved, which has created favorable conditions for the further development of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. At the same time, in our enterprises, the proportion of manual operations is still quite large. Even in modern large-scale enterprises with a high degree of mechanization, there are still a considerable number of manual labor and great equipment potential. In short, no matter which industry, no matter whether it is a large, medium, or small enterprise, it is urgently necessary to replace manpower with machinery and comprehensively improve technology in order to ensure a substantial increase in production. Therefore, as soon as the Party issued a call, the broad masses of workers in all regions, all industries, and all types of enterprises, large, medium, and small, plunged into the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution.

Vigorously promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization can rapidly increase labor productivity, not only can increase production without increasing personnel, but also can save a lot of labor force to support other departments. At the same time, it guarantees quality and improves quality.

All regions and all enterprises should formulate plans for mechanization and semi-mechanization in a comprehensive manner according to their specific circumstances. First of all, they should focus on those places where manual operations and heavy physical labor occupy the most labor force, and strive to quickly realize semi-mechanization and mechanization, and develop in the direction of semi-automation and automation where possible; in places with a high degree of mechanization, they should comprehensively improve the level of mechanization and vigorously develop semi-automation and automation. While vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, we must also rationally improve labor organization and production organization, widely reform tools, improve operation methods, adopt advanced technology, pay attention to saving and comprehensively utilizing raw materials, open up new sources of raw materials, improve product design, and create advanced and sophisticated new products.

In order to rapidly improve our production capacity and technical level, we need to guide the masses to break through the weak links in production. The initial rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was originally a weak link in the overall improvement of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel rolling capacity during the Great Leap Forward. The factory Party committee mobilized workers to focus on the initial rolling mill and shearing machine in key processes to carry out technical revolution with concentrated efforts, and continuously break through weak links. Each time, the production capacity was improved one step, and finally the entire process from rolling to hoisting was realized "Dual operation", which greatly increased the production capacity of the entire factory and increased the production of tens of thousands of tons of steel billets per month, changing the original backward situation. Many of our advanced enterprises have mobilized the masses to find the key, analyze the key, and take revolutionary measures to overcome the key, from imbalance to balance, from new imbalance to new balance, so that the enterprise production can continue to develop rapidly.

In order to establish China's complete industrial system and realize the modernization of science and technology, there are now many workers in various places who are marching towards modern science and technology with the firm support and enthusiastic care of the Party and have achieved outstanding results.

In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must resolutely implement the spirit of self-reliance as the main focus and the principle of "walking on two legs" by combining foreign and indigenous methods. If you can use foreign methods, use foreign methods; if you can't use foreign methods, use indigenous methods. In the Great Leap Forward, the working masses created indigenous methods such as "ants gnawing bones" and "building block" machine tools to build large machines. The significance of these mass creations is great. Recently, workers in many factories have also quickly established automated production lines by first starting with indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. It is not right to want to be perfect and 100% modern from the beginning. Of course, it is also not right if you do not pay attention to improving after starting with indigenous methods.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must widely develop communist cooperation. Mutual cooperation between enterprises, especially between enterprises, schools, and scientific research institutions, is very beneficial to the development of technical revolution, scientific research, and teaching work. Within factories and enterprises, we must adhere to the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians. The "one-dragon" cooperation of production, supply, transportation, and sales that developed in 1959 is a good way to promote various departments to improve their work, improve technology, and achieve common development, and it needs to be continued and promoted.

Since the Great Leap Forward, all localities have universally and deeply carried out the socialist competition of comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward, and the forms of competition are rich and colorful. The technical performance competitions, production sports meetings, production battles, key problem tackling competitions, and chain competitions carried out in various places have effectively promoted the development of technical innovation and technical revolution. In the process of competition, we must firmly grasp the summarization and promotion of advanced experience and combine creation with learning. We must promptly convene on-site meetings, organize advanced experience promotion teams and observation teams, hold exhibitions, and other methods to widely organize workers to learn advanced experience, especially the advanced experience of the national and local mass heroes conferences, and continue to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

To smoothly carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, the most fundamental guarantee is to adhere to putting politics in command. Under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations must strengthen ideological and political work among the working masses. Trade union organizations must also be good at discovering and caring for new things, and constantly promote the creative spirit of the masses. It should be noted that after a nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement is vigorously launched, some shortcomings will inevitably arise. In the creative activities of the broad masses, some difficulties will inevitably be encountered, and even some setbacks will be encountered. We must never be alarmed by this, let alone dampen the enthusiasm and creative enthusiasm of the masses. In addition, we must promptly mobilize the masses to improve and strengthen enterprise management, implement the system of two participations, one transformation, and three combinations, and improve technical management with the development of the movement; we must educate the masses to pay attention to safe production, and always pay attention to researching and solving new problems arising in the movement, so that the movement can move forward smoothly.

3.  Vigorously Support Agricultural Technical Transformation and Further Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance

Our country has entered a new historical period of carrying out agricultural technical transformation on a large scale. Within about ten years, gradually realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture and build our country's agriculture on the basis of modern technology. This is a new great historical task that the Party has put forward to us. At present, the large-scale water conservancy construction and the universal tool reform in rural areas urgently require industrial support for a large number of drainage and irrigation equipment, construction tools, agricultural machinery, and transportation tools. Therefore, whether it is to achieve the long-term goal or to adapt to the current situation of the great leap forward in agriculture, all workers across the country are required to actively mobilize and regard supporting agricultural technical transformation as a new content of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and an unswerving glorious responsibility.

Under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations must educate the broad masses of workers to recognize that agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy, recognize the great significance of developing agriculture to promote industrial development, further establish a firm view of serving the development of agriculture, and launch a mass movement to support agricultural technical transformation. The working masses in the agricultural machinery, fertilizer, and pesticide manufacturing departments that directly serve agriculture have the main task of striving to complete production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill them, and providing more and better products for agricultural technical transformation. We must take the initiative to organize cadres and workers to go to the countryside to understand the use of products and the opinions of farmers on the products, and constantly improve product quality and add new varieties. At present, it is particularly important to ensure that the production tasks of drainage and irrigation equipment and agricultural machinery are completed ahead of schedule in order to meet the needs of spring plowing and spring sowing. Other, more numerous factories and mining enterprises, while first ensuring the completion of the production tasks of their own enterprises, must mobilize the masses to adopt various effective forms to do everything possible to support agricultural technical transformation.

Factory-commune linking is an effective form of mass industrial support for agricultural technical transformation. This form has a fixed object, clear responsibilities, and is easy to develop long-term plans and specific measures, giving play to the enthusiasm and initiative of both parties.

Organizing service teams and helping to establish repair and distribution networks is another good form. Many places have organized this activity, and according to needs and possibilities, they go to help nearby people's communes repair machinery, help farmers become familiar with and master technology, and have achieved great results.

With the development of agricultural technical transformation, rural areas need more and more technical talents. Many enterprises have organized technical training teams to regularly go to nearby people's communes to teach technology, train apprentices, and solve technical difficulties; or cooperate with relevant departments to run short-term training classes, inviting people's communes to send people to learn. These are effective ways to help people's communes cultivate technical forces.

Another important aspect of supporting agricultural technical transformation is to help commune-run industries. Trade union organizations should actively and proactively coordinate with relevant departments, use forms such as on-site meetings and advanced experience promotion teams to summarize and exchange advanced experience, help commune-run industries improve their technical level and management level, improve product quality, reduce costs, and increase varieties. Local county and town trade unions should treat the mass work of supporting agricultural technical transformation and commune-run industries as their regular central task.

Financial and trade, transportation, cultural and educational, and other fronts are also closely related to agricultural technical transformation. The broad masses of workers in these areas should make full use of their existing experience and better fulfill their responsibilities in supporting agricultural technical transformation. Trade union organizations at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party, give full play to the masses according to the characteristics of the industry and make remarkable achievements.

4.  Deeply Carry Out Cultural Revolution

Cultural revolution and technical revolution are closely linked. The more production technology improves, the more workers need higher scientific and cultural knowledge. With the great leap forward in production and the development of technical innovation and technical revolution, workers' cultural and technical education has also greatly developed and improved, and a new situation of continuous upward movement has emerged. By last December, more than 16.8 million workers had participated in spare-time study, an increase of more than 50 percent compared with 1958. Now, many large and medium-sized enterprises have a worker education system from literacy, elementary to junior college, and many places have formed a set of worker education networks organized by factories, factories jointly, factories and schools jointly, and regions. Worker education has implemented the Party's education policy and has played a significant role in improving workers' political awareness and promoting the technical revolution.

The current task of workers' spare-time education is to further implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, resolutely eliminate illiteracy among existing workers, promptly popularize elementary education, vigorously run secondary and higher education, and quickly cultivate technical forces.

Socialist enterprises must not only produce new products, but also cultivate new people, so as to achieve "production leads education, and education promotes production," a double leap forward in production and education. Conducting worker spare-time education must not only be combined with the current needs of production, but also pay attention to the long-term needs of production and construction development; it must not only learn what is needed, but also systematically improve cultural and technical levels; it must not only attach importance to political education, but also grasp cultural education; it must not only develop greatly in quantity, but also pay attention to consolidation and improvement, and further develop on the basis of consolidation and improvement.

Running spare-time worker education must rely on the masses to be self-reliant, and at the same time, vigorously promote cooperation. Last year, many factories ran schools on a large scale by working hard and "finding teachers themselves if there were no teachers, and making equipment themselves if there was no equipment;" on the other hand, they also carried out joint school running between factories and factories, factories and schools, scientific research units, organs, troops, etc., which promoted worker education and improved the work of various units.

Earnestly implementing the principles of "combining with production, unified arrangement, teaching students according to their aptitude, and being flexible and diverse" can smoothly carry out worker spare-time education. Part-work and part-study is a new thing produced in the Great Leap Forward, which must be valued and earnestly summarize the existing experience.

Worker spare-time education should be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party, with the cooperation of all parties, level-by-level responsibility, and a combination of blocks and lines. Trade union organizations must shoulder this important responsibility assigned by the Party. Trade unions at all levels must establish full-time institutions and have a chairman or vice-chairman in charge of this work. Trade unions must closely cooperate with enterprise administrative departments, education administrative departments, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and other relevant parties to run worker spare-time education well. We must organize workers' cultural activities well, actively carry out mass sports activities, and strengthen militia work.

5.  Comprehensively Arrange and Organize the Lives of the Working Masses

It is our Party's consistent policy to not only do a good job in production, but also do a good job in life. When arranging and organizing the lives of the working masses, we should earnestly implement the Party's policy of "gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity" and "proceeding from a population of 600 million, taking overall consideration and making appropriate arrangements." Improving the material lives of the masses must be conducive to strengthening unity, conducive to promoting the improvement of the political awareness of the masses, and conducive to the high-speed development of production. The working masses put it well: "We want politics in command, not money in command." Only by closely combining politics and economy, continuously improving the masses politically, enabling the working masses to correctly understand the relationship between the individual and the country, the relationship between production and life, making the current interests subordinate to the long-term interests, and fully promoting the communist labor attitude can our construction cause advance at a high speed.

In recent years, on the basis of the development of industry and agriculture in our country, the material and cultural lives of workers across the country have also been greatly improved. A large number of workers' families have been employed, and the income of workers' families has also increased to varying degrees. Especially in order to adapt to the great development of production and the needs of workers' lives, in the past one or two years, industrial and mining enterprises and urban streets have greatly developed collective living welfare undertakings, which have not only greatly improved the lives of the working masses and strengthened the spirit of collectivism, but also promoted the continued advancement of production and construction.

With the continuous great leap forward of the national economy, the broad masses of workers' families participate in social labor, and people's living habits and lifestyles have also undergone a series of changes, and the degree of socialization of housework and collectivization of life has been further improved. This objective situation urgently requires us to take on greater responsibilities and earnestly and comprehensively arrange and organize the economic lives of the working masses. Particular attention should be paid to strengthening collective living welfare undertakings.

Under the unified leadership of the Party, trade unions must coordinate with relevant parties, rely on the strength of the masses themselves, and do a good job in the collective living welfare undertakings of the working masses in a planned and step-by-step manner. According to the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, we must fully mobilize the masses, be self-reliant, make do with what is available, adapt to local conditions, overcome difficulties, and run collective living welfare undertakings more, faster, better, and more economically.

Raising pigs and growing vegetables and other non-staple food production has a direct relationship with the improvement of the lives of the masses, and we should make full use of favorable conditions to greatly develop it.

With the development of production, factories and mining enterprises in various places have added many worker canteens and improved the service quality of the canteens. In the future, we should establish more canteens as needed and vigorously carry out the mechanization of canteens to run the existing and newly built canteens better.

Since the Great Leap Forward, nurseries and kindergartens in various forms have greatly developed. However, they still cannot meet the growing needs of the working masses and must continue to be held in large numbers.

Adjusting dormitories according to workshops, types of work, and shifts can unify production organization and life organization, strengthen the unity and mutual assistance of workers, and facilitate the organization of workers' cultural and technical learning. All those who have the conditions can refer to this principle and make adjustments. New factories should also be organized to live in groups according to workshops and shifts. At the same time, we must mobilize the masses to strengthen dormitory management.

While grasping collective living welfare undertakings, we must also continuously improve the work of wage rewards, labor insurance, and the protection of female workers in accordance with new situations. The mass work of paying attention to hygiene, eliminating the four pests, and preventing diseases must be done regularly. The masses' mutual aid savings association should also continue to be run well. We must take the initiative to care for and help the few workers who have difficulties.

To meet the various needs of the lives of the masses, in recent years, service stations have been set up in many industrial and mining enterprises across the country, especially on urban streets. There are many service items, ranging from buying rice, flour, and non-staple foods on behalf, fetching water and cooking meals, and dismantling and washing sewing and mending to entrusted children, taking care of housework, cleaning and hygiene, etc., in every possible way. Service stations not only undertake the trivial housework of the masses, but also become a strong assistant to state-owned commercial and service departments, and organize the economic life of the masses well. With the development of production and the further changes in people's lifestyles, service undertakings will gradually develop into modern economic undertakings. Trade union organizations at all levels must treat this work from a political height, actively support, consolidate, and improve this service undertaking, and through this work, closely combine political work and work for the service of the masses, so as to better encourage the working enthusiasm of the working masses.

Now, various places are more deeply mobilizing the broad masses of urban residents, carrying out cooperation between large, medium, and small enterprises, further organizing the masses to participate in production, and actively developing street industries and running collective welfare and cultural and educational undertakings. This is of great significance for comprehensively organizing the political, economic, and cultural lives of the urban people, transforming old cities and building socialist new cities. Trade union organizations must enthusiastically support and actively participate in this work.

Comrades, the tasks before us are very glorious and arduous. In order to complete this task, we must resolutely implement the Party's General Line and the Party's labor movement policy, earnestly understand and master the Party's principles and policies, arrange our own work around the Party's political tasks and central work, educate and organize the masses to actively complete the Party's central tasks, and play the role of an assistant to the Party.

Mass work is the cause of the whole Party. Trade unions must firmly establish the overall concept, overcome the remnants of guild thinking, and actively and proactively cooperate closely with administrative departments, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and other relevant parties in order to better complete the Party's tasks.

As a mass organization under the leadership of the Party, trade unions must continuously educate the masses with communist ideology and educate themselves. In our work, we must earnestly implement the Party's mass line. We must be good at grasping the mainstream, grasping the advanced, grasping the typical, and strengthening specific guidance to the grassroots. Doing a good job in group work is the foundation for doing a good job in trade union work. We must attach importance to the cultivation of groups and earnestly summarize experience.

To complete this year's tasks, the most fundamental guarantee is to resolutely use Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all our actions. Every trade union cadre must earnestly study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, deeply and systematically understand and master Mao Zedong Thought, and publicize Mao Zedong Thought. The long-term revolutionary and construction practice of our country proves that no matter how difficult and complex the task is, as long as Mao Zedong Thought is in command, it will surely be victorious; and once it deviates from Mao Zedong Thought, it will inevitably make mistakes. Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely unite around the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, foster lofty aspirations, and strive to achieve a better and more comprehensive great leap forward in 1960!

    高举毛泽东旗帜，树雄心，立大志，为实现1960年更好的跃进而奋斗
    刘宁一在全国总工会第八届执行委员会第三次全体会议上的报告（摘要）
    我们正面临着空前未有的大好形势。在党和毛泽东同志领导下，我国工人阶级、农民群众、革命知识分子和全体劳动人民团结一致，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，又取得了一九五九年连续大跃进，提前三年完成第二个五年计划的伟大胜利；特别是在党的八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲的号召后，全国人民更是以昂扬的斗志，忘我的劳动，掀起了空前高涨的增产节约运动，使我国社会主义建设进入了高速度发展的新阶段。随着社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，党和毛泽东同志所提出的建设社会主义的三大法宝——党的总路线，大跃进和人民公社越来越显示出无限的威力，越来越证明无比正确和伟大。广大职工和全国人民更加热爱党，热爱毛主席，更加认识到毛泽东思想是战无不胜，攻无不克的武器。我国职工群众和全国人民坚信：有了三大法宝，就一定能够加速社会主义建设，并且为将来实现由社会主义向共产主义过渡创造条件。
    目前，全国各个地区和各个方面都呈现了欣欣向荣、全面发展的宏伟局面。职工群众运动也在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
    经过全国职工的努力，一九六○年一开始就在各个战线上实现了空前未有的开门红，提前完成了一月份的生产计划，不仅是产量持续上升，而且，质量、品种、成本、劳动生产率等各项指标都超额完成了计划，继续出现了全面跃进的新气象。
    在国民经济连续跃进中，群众性的技术革命和文化革命运动，正在一日千里地前进。在工业、基本建设、交通运输和财贸战线上，广大职工群众都高度发挥了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，开始为大规模实现手工劳动机械化、半机械化和机械操作自动化、半自动化而努力奋斗。我国工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，还和农业战线上的技术改造运动汇合起来，成为全民性的技术革命巨流。在进行技术革命的同时，全国还掀起了文化革命的高潮，广大职工纷纷立大志、鼓大劲，学习文化和科学技术。全国文化、教育和科学研究人员也正在和生产战线密切结合，提高自己的工作，刻苦钻研，努力攀登科学文化高峰。
    经过两年的连续大跃进，我国职工群众的共产主义觉悟空前高涨。在企业中，干部、工人和技术人员更是连成一片心，拧成一股劲。共产主义大协作愈来愈广泛地发展着。职工群众中的集体主义精神大高涨，共产主义风格大发扬，先进集体和先进生产者大量涌现。比先进，赶先进，学先进，帮后进的社会主义竞赛比以往更是热火朝天。
    以上一切说明，我国职工群众已在党的总路线红旗下更加紧密地团结和组织起来，正在和全国人民一起，以不断革命的精神，无产阶级的雄心壮志，决心要在今后十年中，在主要工业产品产量方面，赶上和超过英国；基本上建立起我国完整的工业体系；基本上实现我国工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，把我国建设成一个强大的社会主义国家。
    大跃进以来，我国各级工会组织，在党的领导下，与有关方面通力合作，坚决贯彻执行了党的总路线，积极主动地响应党的号召，完成了党所交给的任务。在以生产为中心，生产、生活、教育相结合的群众工作中，绝大多数工会干部都是深入生产，深入群众，使工会组织发挥了共产主义学校的作用，成为党的有力助手。
    一九六○年，工会组织要在党的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东旗帜，继续贯彻执行党的总路线，深入动员和团结全体职工群众树雄心，立大志，以不断革命的精神和崇高的共产主义风格，全面开展技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，大力支援农业技术改造，深入进行文化革命，全面组织经济生活，保证生产持续上升，一定要提前和超额完成国家计划，实现国民经济继续大跃进。
    一、广泛开展学习马克思列宁主义毛泽东著作的运动
    毛泽东思想就是马克思列宁主义普遍真理和革命具体实践相结合的典范，是指导中国革命和社会主义建设不断取得胜利的锐利武器。毛泽东同志把马列主义普遍真理同人民群众创造精神结合起来，他的著作，丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。我党的经验充分证明，毛泽东思想一被群众掌握就会变成巨大的物质力量。因此，工会组织必须在党的领导下，在职工群众中广泛开展学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的运动，使广大职工群众掌握和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想作为一切行动和工作的指针。
    要使广大职工群众掌握毛泽东思想，在当前，首先要进一步宣传我国建设社会主义的三大法宝。三大法宝是毛主席创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国实际结合起来的伟大产物，是对马克思列宁主义所作出的重大贡献。目前各个战线上正在进行的社会主义教育运动的目的，主要是使广大职工群众进一步认识三大法宝的伟大意义，进一步划清资本主义和社会主义两条道路的界限，更加自觉地运用三大法宝，加速社会主义建设，并且使职工群众更深入地领会毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东同志的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想，引导我们适时地从一个革命阶段发展到另一个革命阶段，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。我们要反复向职工群众宣传毛泽东同志的不断革命的思想，以六十年代的形势任务和共产主义伟大理想教育职工群众，使他们不仅充分认清当前的形势，而且还充分认识到伟大的未来，既有实现当前任务的决心，又有崇高的理想，不断奋斗，永远前进。
    学习毛泽东思想最主要的目的就是要以无产阶级世界观来认识世界、改造世界，并在改造世界的同时，改造自己。经过党的八届八中全会关于反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动决议的贯彻执行，经过社会主义教育运动，广大职工群众表现了从来没有过的共产主义精神大高涨。“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”，“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”，就是职工群众高度共产主义觉悟的具体表现。这是当前职工思想的主流。但是，我国国内资产阶级还未完全消灭，同时，随着建设事业的日益发展，农民和小资产阶级出身的人以至剥削阶级出身的分子，陆续涌入工人阶级的行列。因而，资产阶级思想和各种非无产阶级思想还会经常侵袭工人阶级的队伍。所以，我们必须不断地在职工群众中兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想，立共产主义思想，破个人主义思想，使广大职工群众树立起坚定的无产阶级世界观，鼓足干劲，力争上游，把群众运动不断地向前推进，使社会主义建设不断跃进。
    我国广大职工群众从实践中已经充分认识到毛泽东思想就是真理，是我们事业不断取得胜利的保证。他们都迫切要求以毛泽东思想来武装自己，以高度的热情开展了学习毛泽东著作的运动。这个运动就是马克思列宁主义的普及运动，它将大大提高职工群众的政治觉悟和思想水平，促进马克思列宁主义的发展，对我国社会主义和共产主义事业必将发生极为深远的影响。工会要在党的领导下，和共青团，妇联及其他方面共同协作，把这个运动更广泛地开展起来。
    二、全面开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动
    目前，全国广大职工群众都在大搞机械化、半机械化，不少企业的职工还在原有设备的基础上，逐步实现了联动生产线、单机自动化和自动化生产线，我国的技术革新和技术革命已经进入到一个新的阶段。
    大搞以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，就能加速企业的技术改造，促进我国国民经济持续跃进。经过十年的建设，我国的物质技术基础和科学研究工作都有了很大的加强，职工的文化技术水平有了很大的提高，尤其是经过破除迷信，解放思想，大大提高了共产主义风格，这就为技术革新和技术革命群众运动的进一步发展创造了有利条件。同时，在我们的企业里，手工操作的比重还相当大。就是机械化程度较高的现代化大企业中，也有相当数量的手工劳动和很大的设备潜力。总之不论那一个行业，也不论是大中小企业都迫切需要用机械代替人力，全面提高技术，才能保证生产大幅度地增长。因此，一经党发出号召，全国各地方、各产业、大中小各类企业的广大职工群众，就都投入了技术革新和技术革命的热潮。
    大搞以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，就能迅速提高劳动生产率，不但可以做到增产不增人，而且还可大量节约劳动力，支援其他部门。同时保证质量、提高质量。
    各个地方和各个企业都要根据具体情况，全面制定机械化半机械化的规划。首先应当对准那些占用劳动力最多的手工操作和笨重体力劳动的地方，努力迅速实现半机械化、机械化，并在可能的条件下向半自动化、自动化方向发展；在机械化程度较高的地方，就要全面提高机械化水平，大力开展半自动化和自动化。在大搞机械化、自动化同时、还要合理地改善劳动组织和生产组织，广泛改革工具，改进操作方法，采用先进工艺，重视节约和综合利用原材料，开辟原料新的来源，改进产品设计，并且创制高级、精密的新产品。
    为了迅速地提高我们的生产能力和技术水平，我们需要引导群众去突破生产中的薄弱环节。鞍钢初轧厂在大跃进中本来是鞍钢轧钢能力全面提高的薄弱环节，工厂党委便发动职工先后以关键工序上的初轧机、剪断机为重点，集中力量大闹技术革命，不间断地突破薄弱环节，每次都使生产能力提高一步，最后从轧制到吊装的全部工艺过程都实现了“双路作业”，使全厂生产能力有很大的提高，每月可以增产几万吨钢坯，改变了原来的落后面貌。我们许多先进企业就是这样发动群众找关键、分析关键、采取革命手段，攻破关键，从不平衡到平衡，从新的不平衡到新的平衡，使企业生产不断地迅速发展。
    为了建立我国完整的工业体系和实现科学技术的现代化，现在各地都有不少职工在党的坚决支持和热情关怀下向现代科学技术进军，取得了出色的成绩。
    在大闹技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们要坚决贯彻自力更生为主的精神和洋土结合“两条腿走路”的方针。能洋就洋，不能洋就土。在大跃进中，职工群众创造了“蚂蚁啃骨头”、“积木式”机床等土办法，造出了大机器，这些群众性创造的意义很大。最近，不少工厂的职工，又先用土法上马，土洋结合的方法，迅速建立了自动化生产线。那种只想一开始就十全十美，百分之百的现代化，是不对的。自然，土法上马后，不去注意提高也是不对的。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，要广泛地发展共产主义协作。企业和企业之间，特别是企业、学校、科学研究机关之间互相协作，对于技术革命、科学研究工作和教学工作的发展都很有益处。在工厂企业内，必须坚持领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合的方法。1959年发展起来的产、供、运、销“一条龙”大协作，是促进各个部门改善工作，改进技术，达到共同发展的好办法，需要继续发展和推广。
    大跃进以来，各地都普遍地、深入地开展了比先进、赶先进、学先进、帮后进的社会主义竞赛，竞赛的形式丰富多采。各地开展的技术表演赛，生产运动会，生产大会战，攻关赛，连环赛等，都有力地推动了技术革新和技术革命的开展。在竞赛过程中，要紧紧抓住总结和推广先进经验，使创造和学习相结合。我们要及时召开现场会议，组织先进经验推广队、观摩队，举办展览会等方法，广泛组织职工学习先进经验特别是全国和各地群英大会的先进经验，继续认真学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验。
    要顺利地开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，最根本的保证，就是要坚持政治挂帅。工会组织要在党的领导下，在职工群众中加强思想政治工作。工会组织还要善于发现和关怀新生事物，不断发扬群众的创造精神。应当看到，在一个全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动轰轰烈烈开展起来后，不可避免地会产生一些缺点，在广大群众创造活动中，也必然会遇到一些困难，甚至会遭到一些挫折。我们对此决不能大惊小怪，更不能挫伤群众的干劲和创造热情。此外，我们还要随着运动的发展，及时动员群众改善和加强企业管理，贯彻两参一改三结合的制度，改进技术管理；要教育群众重视安全生产，并且随时注意研究和解决运动中产生的新问题，使运动顺利向前推进。
    三、大力支援农业技术改造，进一步巩固工农联盟
    我国已进入了大规模地进行农业技术改造的新的历史时期。要在十年左右的时间内，逐步实现农业的机械化和电气化，把我国的农业建立在现代化技术的基础上，这是党向我们提出的一个新的伟大的历史任务。目前，农村中大规模的水利建设和普遍的工具改革，迫切需要工业支援大量的排灌设备、施工工具、农业机械、运输工具。因此，无论是为了实现远大的目标，或者是为了适应目前农业大跃进的形势，都要求全国职工积极动员起来，把支援农业技术改造作为巩固工农联盟的新内容和义不容辞的光荣责任。
    工会组织必须在党的领导下，教育广大职工认识农业是发展国民经济的基础，认识发展农业对促进工业发展的重大意义，进一步树立起坚强的为发展农业服务的观点，掀起支援农业技术改造的群众运动。直接为农业服务的农业机械、化肥和农药制造部门的职工群众，主要的任务就在于争取提前和超额完成生产任务，为农业技术改造提供更多更好的产品。要主动地组织干部和工人到农村去了解产品的使用情况和农民对产品的意见，不断改进产品质量，增加新的品种。当前特别重要的是要保证提前完成排灌设备和农业机具的生产任务，以满足春耕春播的需要。其它为数更多的厂矿企业，在首先保证完成本企业生产任务的同时，要发动群众采取各种有效形式千方百计地去支援农业技术改造。
    厂社挂钩是群众性的工业支援农业技术改造的一种有效形式。这种形式对象固定，责任明确，便于订出长远规划和具体措施，发挥双方的积极性和主动性。
    组织服务队，帮助建立修配网，是另一个良好的形式。许多地方已组织了这种活动，根据需要和可能，去帮助附近的人民公社检修机械，帮助农民熟悉和掌握技术，取得了很大成绩。
    随着农业技术改造的发展，农村越来越需要更多的技术人材。有不少企业组织了技术传授队，定期到附近人民公社传授技术，培养徒弟，解决技术困难问题；或协同有关部门办短期训练班，请人民公社派人来学习，这些都是帮助人民公社培养技术力量的有效办法。
    支援农业技术改造的另一个重要方面，就是帮助社办工业。工会组织要积极主动地协同有关部门，运用现场会议、先进经验推广队等形式，总结与交流先进经验，帮助社办工业提高技术水平和管理水平，提高产品质量，降低成本和增加品种。各地县镇工会更应把支援农业技术改造和社办工业的群众工作当为自己经常的中心任务。
    财经贸易、交通运输、文化教育等各个战线，也都和农业技术改造有着密切的关系。这些方面的广大职工都应该充分利用已有的经验，在支援农业技术改造中，更好地负起自己的责任。各级工会组织都要在党的领导下根据产业的特点，放手发动群众，作出显著成绩。
    四、深入开展文化革命
    文化革命和技术革命是密切相联的。生产技术越提高，越要求工人有更高的科学文化知识。随着生产的大跃进，技术革新和技术革命的开展，职工的文化、技术教育也有了很大的发展和提高，出现了持续向上的新局面。到去年十二月，参加业余学习的职工有一千六百八十多万人，比一九五八年增长了百分之五十以上。现在，许多大中型企业已经有了从扫盲、初等到大专的职工教育体系，很多地方已经形成了厂办、工厂联办、厂校联办、地区举办的一套职工教育网。职工教育贯彻执行了党的教育方针，对提高职工政治觉悟、促进技术革命起了显著的作用。
    当前职工业余教育的任务是：进一步贯彻执行教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，坚决扫除现有职工中的文盲，及时普及初等教育，大办中等和高等教育，迅速培养技术力量。
    社会主义企业既要生产新产品，又要培养新人，做到“生产带教育，教育促生产”，生产、教育双跃进。进行职工业余教育既要结合当前生产的需要，也要注意生产建设发展的长远需要；既要用什么学什么，又要系统地提高文化、技术水平；既要重视政治教育，也要抓紧文化教育；既要在数量上大发展，又要注意巩固、提高，在巩固、提高的基础上又进一步发展。
    举办业余职工教育要依靠群众自力更生，同时大搞协作。去年不少工厂一方面穷干苦干，“没有教师自己找，没有设备自己造”，大举办学；另一方面又开展工厂与工厂，工厂与学校、科学研究单位、机关、部队等等之间的联合办学，推动了职工教育，改善了各单位的工作。
    认真地贯彻“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的原则，才能顺利地开展职工业余教育。半工半读是大跃进中产生的新事物，必须重视，认真地总结已有的经验。
    职工业余教育要在党的统一领导下，各方协作，层层负责，块块条条相结合地去进行。工会组织要把党交给的这项重大责任承担起来。各级工会都要建立专职机构，有一位主席或副主席主管这项工作。工会要和企业行政部门、教育行政部门、共青团、妇联等各有关方面，亲密合作，办好职工业余教育。要组织好职工的文化活动，积极开展群众性的体育活动，加强民兵工作。
    五、全面安排和组织职工群众生活
    既要搞好生产，又要搞好生活，是我们党的一贯的方针。我们在安排和组织职工群众生活问题时，应该认真贯彻党的“在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步地改善职工的生活”和“从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针。改善群众的物质生活，必须有利于加强团结，有利于促进群众政治觉悟的提高，有利于生产的高速度发展。职工群众说得好：“要政治挂帅，不要钞票挂帅。”只有把政治与经济密切地结合起来，从政治上不断地提高群众，使职工群众正确认识个人和国家的关系、生产与生活的关系、使当前利益服从于长远利益，充分发扬共产主义的劳动态度，才能使我们的建设事业高速度地前进。
    几年来，在我国工农业发展的基础上，全国职工物质和文化生活也获得了巨大的改善。职工家属大量就业，职工家庭收入也有了不同程度的增加。特别是为着适应生产大发展和职工生活需要，近一两年来工矿企业、城市街道大量发展了集体生活福利事业，不仅大大改善了职工群众的生活，加强了集体主义精神，而且促进了生产建设事业的继续向前发展。
    随着国民经济的连续大跃进，广大职工家属参加社会劳动，人们的生活习惯、生活方式，也发生了一系列的变化，家务劳动社会化和生活集体化程度有了进一步提高。这种客观形势，迫切要求我们负起更大的责任，认真地全面安排和组织好职工群众的经济生活。特别要注意加强集体的生活福利事业。
    工会必须在党的统一领导下，协同有关方面，依靠群众自己的力量，有计划、有步骤地搞好职工群众的集体生活福利事业。根据勤俭建国和勤俭办一切事业的方针，充分发动群众，自力更生，因陋就简，因地制宜，克服困难，把集体生活福利事业办得又多、又快、又好、又省。
    养猪、种菜等副食品生产对群众生活的改善有着直接关系，我们应该充分运用有利条件，使之大量发展。
    随着生产的发展，各地厂矿企业都增设了许多职工食堂，提高了食堂服务质量。今后我们应该根据需要建立更多的食堂，大力开展食堂机械化的运动，把已有和新建的食堂办得更好。
    大跃进以来，各种形式的托儿所、幼儿园虽然有了很大发展。但是仍然不能满足职工群众日益增长的需要，必须继续大量举办。
    按车间、工种、班次调整宿舍，可以使生产组织和生活组织趋于统一，加强职工的团结互助，便于组织职工的文化技术学习。凡有条件的，都可以参照这个原则，加以调整。新建工厂，也最好按车间、班次编组住宿。同时要发动群众加强宿舍管理。
    在抓集体生活福利事业的同时，对于工资奖励工作、劳动保险工作、女工保护工作也必须适应新的情况不断加以改进。群众性的讲卫生、除四害、预防疾病的工作，必须经常做好。群众的互助储金会也应该继续办好。对少数有困难的职工，我们必须主动给以关心和帮助。
    适应群众生活的各种需要，近年来，在全国许多工矿企业中，特别是在城市街道上，大量办起了服务站。服务项目多种多样，从代买米面副食品，打水做饭、拆洗缝补到受托儿童、照顾家务、清洁卫生等等，无微不至。服务站不但承担了群众的家务琐事，还成为国营商业和服务部门的有力助手，很好地组织了群众的经济生活。随着生产向前发展和人们生活方式的进一步变化，服务性事业必将会逐步发展成为现代化的经济事业。工会各级组织要把这一工作提到政治高度来看待，要积极扶植巩固和提高这种服务性的事业，要通过这一工作，把政治工作和为群众服务的工作紧密地结合起来，更好地鼓舞职工群众的劳动热情。
    现在，各地正在更加深入发动广大城市居民，开展大中小企业的协作，进一步组织群众参加生产，积极发展街道工业，举办集体福利和文化教育事业。这对全面组织城市人民的政治、经济和文化生活，改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市，有着重大意义，工会组织必须热忱支持，积极参加这一工作。
    同志们，摆在我们面前的任务是十分光荣而又繁重的。为了完成这一任务，我们必须坚决贯彻党的总路线和党的工运方针，认真领会和掌握党的方针政策，围绕党的政治任务和中心工作，安排本身的工作，教育和组织群众积极地完成党的中心任务，发挥党的助手作用。
    群众工作是全党的事业。工会必须牢固地树立起整体观念，克服行会思想的残余，积极主动地同行政部门，共青团和妇联等有关方面密切协作，才能更好地完成党的任务。
    工会作为党的领导下的群众组织，必须不断以共产主义思想教育群众，并且教育自己。在工作中要认真贯彻党的群众路线。我们要善于抓主流，抓先进，抓典型，加强对基层的具体指导。搞好小组工作是搞好工会工作的基础。我们必须重视对小组的培养，并且认真总结经验。
    要完成今年的任务，最根本的保证就是要坚决以毛泽东思想作为我们一切行动的指南。每个工会干部都必须认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，深入系统地领会和掌握毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想。我国长期的革命和建设实践证明，无论是多么艰巨复杂的任务，只要毛泽东思想挂了帅，都一定能胜利；而一旦离开了毛泽东思想，就必然要犯错误。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想旗帜，紧密地团结在党和毛泽东同志的周围，树雄心，立大志，为实现一九六○年更好更全面的大跃进而英勇奋斗吧！
