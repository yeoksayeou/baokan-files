Several Questions on Consolidating and Developing People's Communes
Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee

    People's communes, after a year and a half of growth and expansion, have blossomed and borne fruit on the land of China, fully demonstrating their vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority in all aspects. The continuous high-speed development of China's national economy for two consecutive years is inseparable from the establishment, consolidation, and development of people's communes. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have found the best social organization form, the people's commune. It can not only guide peasants from the current basic team ownership to basic commune ownership, and from the socialist collective ownership to the socialist ownership by the whole people, but also transition from socialism to communism in the future. With the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, our socialist construction cause will be invincible. This is the result of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's creative development of Marxism-Leninism, and a glorious victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The 1,210 people's communes and more than 330,000 public canteens in Henan Province, after implementing the spirit of the Central Zhengzhou Conference, have undergone systematic rectification and consolidation; after more than a year of production practice and the test of severe natural disasters; since last winter, after the Party rectification and commune rectification movements, a systematic socialist education has been carried out, and they have embarked on a more consolidated and sound development path. It will further promote the continuous Great Leap Forward of the entire national economy in Henan Province. In the process of development, people's communes have encountered many new problems that need further study and resolution. Here, I would like to offer some opinions on the development of commune economy, business management, and income distribution.

    On the Issue of Developing the Commune Economy

    At present, the three-level management and team-based system implemented by the people's communes in Henan Province is adapted to the current needs of productivity development and the level of mass awareness, and has played a huge role in the consolidation and sound development of people's communes. With the development of production, the transition from basic team ownership to basic commune ownership, and then from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, is an inevitable trend of political and economic development. Over the past year, the economy of the commune, the production brigade, and the production team of the people's communes in Henan Province has greatly developed. The commune-level economy accounts for 16.4% of the total output value, the production brigade accounts for 72.7%, and the production team accounts for 6.4%. In 1959, the public accumulation of the commune increased by one-fold compared with 1958. In addition, the income from sideline occupations of commune members accounts for 4.5%. Although the commune ownership is still partial at present, it is the core force and main material basis for driving the entire production of the people's communes to continue to move forward, and it represents the great hope and great future of the people's communes. It is obviously wrong not to see this trend and direction of development, and not to have a guiding ideology of continuous revolution. But it must also be recognized that further consolidation and development of people's communes "must be based on a certain degree of development of productive forces. The relations of production must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces, and only when the productive forces develop to a certain state will certain changes in the relations of production be caused." Therefore, we must vigorously develop productive forces, implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing multiple economies, simultaneously developing commodity production and self-sufficient production, and simultaneously developing planting and animal husbandry, and agriculture and commune industry, to develop agricultural production at high speed. As far as the situation in Henan Province is concerned, the main task at present is to give full play to the potential and role of the basic team ownership to promote the development of production; at the same time, it is necessary to actively and gradually develop the commune-owned economy, help poor teams catch up with rich teams, gradually realize agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization, and continue to strengthen the political education of commune members and improve their socialist and communist consciousness, so as to lay a solid foundation for continuous progress economically, organizationally, and ideologically. We must follow the principles of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to guide the development of the people's commune economy and better and faster consolidate and develop the people's communes.

    To develop the commune-owned economy, we mainly rely on expanding public accumulation and developing commune-run enterprises. We must give full play to the potential of existing commune-run enterprises in terms of labor, capital, equipment, and resources, and actively develop them in light of local conditions, using local materials, and relying on our own efforts. Practice has proved that appropriately developing the commune-owned economy plays a significant role in developing production, strengthening the commune-owned system, and consolidating people's communes. In particular, commune-run industry generally accounts for about 80% of the commune-owned economy, which is of great significance for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture and realizing the industrialization of communes. There are various forms that can be adopted to develop the commune-owned economy: (1) Commune-owned and commune-operated. This mainly involves developing commune-run factories and mines, agricultural machinery stations, power stations, agricultural experiment fields, large-scale forestry, animal husbandry, horticulture, fish farms, and short-distance transportation. (2) Joint commune-brigade operation or commune-owned brigade-operated. This mainly involves developing smaller-scale fertilizer plants, livestock and poultry farms, and sideline food processing plants that are closely related to agricultural production. The specific methods are: first, the commune invests, and the production team provides labor, and the income is divided; second, the commune and the team jointly invest, and the production team provides labor, and the income is divided. (3) Joint operation between teams. This mainly involves developing pastures, forest farms, and horticultural farms that are suitable for production brigades to establish but that a single brigade cannot afford to establish. (4) Commune-run farms, forest farms, pastures, fish farms, and various specialized teams. These farms and teams are directly affiliated enterprises or contracted units of the people's communes, implementing the "several guarantees and several determinations" or the "three guarantees and one reward" system. They are under the unified leadership and accounting of the people's communes, and the wages and supplies are also the responsibility of the people's communes. (5) Joint state-commune operation. This mainly involves processing enterprises jointly run by state finance and trade departments and people's communes, with unified leadership and income sharing. In some areas, counties and communes jointly raise funds to establish fertilizer plants, comprehensive agricultural and livestock farms, etc. The above forms can be adapted to local conditions and experiences can be created.

    Of the original 6,300 poor teams in Henan Province, 23.8% have caught up with the rich teams, and 48.1% have caught up with the general teams. We should continue to strengthen the leadership and support for poor teams, and strive to basically eliminate poor teams this year. We must mobilize and educate the cadres and members of poor teams, establish lofty ambitions, make great efforts, rely on their own efforts, and work hard. We must conscientiously summarize the experience of poor teams catching up with rich teams, analyze the reasons, grasp the key, and comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery production in light of local conditions. We must improve the Party organization, fully mobilize the masses, consolidate the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, and effectively change the backward political outlook of some production teams. The state's investment in people's communes this year must use no less than 60% of the funds to support poor teams to develop production. People's communes can also allocate certain funds to support poor teams according to specific circumstances. Party committees and relevant departments at all levels must include the work of poor teams catching up with rich teams on the agenda, make plans, designate special personnel to be responsible, conduct regular inspections, and strengthen specific leadership. The standards for poor teams to catch up with rich teams are roughly four: first, the production conditions such as water conservancy and basic construction have basically changed; second, the yield per unit area, the average income of commune members, and the rich teams are basically balanced; third, production is steadily increasing and there is a certain amount of grain reserves; fourth, backward teams should be transformed, and the Party and League organizations should be improved, and the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants should be established.

    While developing the commune-owned economy, it is necessary to develop the economy of the production brigade. It is necessary to appropriately develop the commune-owned economy on the condition of giving full play to the enthusiasm of the brigade economy. In terms of capital arrangement, allocation of means of production, and allocation of labor, it is necessary to take into account both the development of the commune-owned economy and the development of the brigade economy. At present, the economy of the production brigade still has great potential. In particular, the development of agricultural production mainly relies on the production brigade, which should be vigorously promoted. This is of great significance for developing production, strengthening the commune-owned economy, and consolidating and developing people's communes. The commune-owned economy and the economy of the production brigade should be comprehensively considered, comprehensively arranged, and appropriately divided. Anything that is more advantageous for the production brigade to handle should be handled by the production brigade. When some projects are more advantageous for the people's communes to operate, they should be discussed, decided through a certain meeting, and operated by the commune in the form of joint commune-team operation or the commune according to the principle of equivalent exchange.

    The small part of the ownership of the production team still plays a certain role in giving play to the production enthusiasm of the production team, tapping production potential, developing production, and increasing the income of commune members. According to the implementation in Henan Province, the small part of the ownership of the production team generally accounts for 5%-10% of the total income of the production brigade. This ratio is appropriate. The income of this part of ownership is mainly super-production rewards. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the tasks assigned by the production brigade and obeying the state market management, the production team can manage scattered land, small fish ponds, and small-scale sideline production.

    On the Issue of Business Management

    Over the past year or so, the business management of people's communes in Henan Province has greatly improved. Many experiences have been created in various places, and many good management methods have been implemented. In particular, the province-wide, in-depth criticism of the erroneous practices of "contracting work and output to households" in a few areas has clearly defined the boundaries between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and clarified the direction of advancement, thereby enabling the business management of people's communes to be further developed. This has been of great educational significance to the Party organizations and the people in Henan at all levels, and has played a significant role in the consolidation and development of people's communes. At present, in terms of production and labor management, the vast majority of production brigades implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system for the production teams; the production teams establish a collective production responsibility system, and implement quota-based small-section contracting for the work teams; and the method of evaluating work and recording points is implemented for commune members. Practice has proved that these methods are very good, as they can not only give full play to the production enthusiasm of the production teams and commune members, but also establish a clear production responsibility system.

    (1) The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" System:

    Guarantee Output - According to the state plan, the actual output of the previous year, and changes in production conditions, the output target is determined in the spirit of being proactive, reliable, and leaving room for maneuver. The output target should generally be equivalent to or slightly higher than the actual output of the previous year. For food crops, the area, yield per unit area, and total output are guaranteed, and for cash crops, the output value is also guaranteed. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery production are also guaranteed to the contracting units according to tasks and output value. The method of guaranteeing output is: one is to uniformly divide the land and set the output by the production brigade, and the other is to divide the production teams into types and set the output according to the ratio.

    Guarantee Work - Most of them are based on production tasks, production conditions, operating procedures for various crops, labor quotas, and labor bearing capacity, and determine the total number of work, and appropriately include miscellaneous work based on the total number of work. The remaining work belongs to the team, and extra work is not compensated. A few are based on the amount of labor in the contracting unit, the number of attendance days, and calculate the total labor days as the total number of work; the miscellaneous work is reimbursed according to the actual expenses. The former method is better than the latter. After guaranteeing the work, if there are extraordinarily large natural disasters and excessive use of labor for farmland capital construction, the number of work can be appropriately increased. There are three methods for guaranteeing sideline work: one is to determine work based on income (set price, set quality); the second is to reward commissions based on the amount of completed tasks; and the third is to implement five determinations and two rewards for animal husbandry, namely, determining leadership, determining tasks, determining fatness, determining work points, and determining breeding, rewarding for increased fatness, and rewarding for breeding.

    Guarantee Investment - Most of the seeds, feed, fertilizer, pesticides, and coal for flue-cured tobacco are uniformly controlled by the brigade, but they must be used for special purposes and allocated to the production team according to the production season. For small farm tools repair costs, lamp oil costs, office expenses, and livestock medical expenses, there are generally three methods: one is to directly guarantee the production team, which is controlled and used by the production team, and savings are returned to the team, and overspending is not compensated. The second is that the funds target is distributed to the production team, but no cash is paid, and the brigade uniformly controls it, and the production team receives physical objects according to the plan. There is also a method to guarantee investment based on the average per mu. Among the above three methods, the first one is better.

    Reward Method - People's communes universally implement the principle of rewarding more and punishing less. Most of the production teams have surplus production and have won awards; a few teams have reduced production, and have been dealt with differently according to different situations. For the distribution of the surplus part, most of the teams follow the ratio of two, three, and five (20 for the brigade, 30 for the production team, and 50 for the commune members), some teams follow the ratio of three, two, and five, and individual teams follow the ratio of three, three, and four. Under the current situation, the first ratio is generally more appropriate. To correctly implement the principle of rewarding more and punishing less, the following points should be achieved: First, in distribution, it is necessary to first do a good job in political and ideological work, mobilize the masses, and report the actual output. As long as there are no other special circumstances, the majority of teams should be able to have output to exceed and awards to be won. Second, summer pre-award, annual unified accounting. Generally, cash should be rewarded, and a portion of grain can also be rewarded on the premise of completing the state procurement task. Third, some production teams, although they have not completed the guaranteed output task, have increased production compared with the previous year, or have made significant achievements in resisting natural disasters, can also be given appropriate material or honorary awards. Fourth, for teams with reduced production, it is necessary to analyze the reasons, and those that have reduced production due to insufficient subjective efforts under the conditions, must be penalized. Generally, no penalties are given for reduced production caused by excessively high output targets or severe natural disasters.

    In short, the three guarantees and one reward system is a major issue in the business management of people's communes and an important guarantee for realizing the national plan. The leadership must implement it throughout the year, grasp it tightly, make a good guarantee at one time, and implement it in the production team. In this way, we can further mobilize the production enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of commune members and ensure the realization of the production plan. Due to the continuous changes in crop planting plans and production conditions, it should be checked and revised three times before and after spring sowing, before and after summer harvest and summer planting, and before and after autumn harvest and autumn planting. The final verification will be made during the fall distribution and settlement. In carrying out this work, we must adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, hold representative meetings, analyze and study, not only have sufficient enthusiasm, but also leave room for maneuver, and not only have advanced indicators, but also have proactive and reliable measures. At present, we should combine spring production and commune rectification work and conscientiously check the three guarantees work this year, especially the three guarantees work for wheat and spring-sown crops must be done well.

    (2) Establishing and Improving the Collective Production Responsibility System:

    Establishing and improving the collective production responsibility system and strengthening labor management is an important issue in developing production, consolidating and improving people's communes. With the high-speed development of production and the need to adapt to the production mode of large collectives, production management and labor organization must gradually realize the baseization of production and the specialization of labor. At present, the labor organization of the production team should be mainly based on perennial work teams, and various types of specialized teams (groups) should be established according to needs. The production team should generally divide several operating areas for management according to the work team and the area under its jurisdiction.

    The production team mainly promotes the collective production responsibility system of quota-based small-section contracting for the work team or specialized team. Its practice is: first, the production team unifies the plan, unifies the leadership, and unifies the quota, and proposes a small-section production plan based on the season, farm work, and operating scope, and contracts the work to the work team or specialized team. Second, organize production and carry out labor competition. Third, in the process of realizing small-section contracting, the production team should appropriately adjust labor, livestock, and farm tools according to the situation. Fourth, evaluation and acceptance, commendation of advanced. Large farm work is accepted by the team, and small farm work is accepted by the team. Fifth, under the principle of adhering to collective labor, for some farm work that is not suitable for collective operation, it can be done by individuals, and responsibility is assigned to individuals. For example, managing scattered fruit trees, collecting manure, etc.

    The above methods are not immutable. Various places can adapt to local conditions and continuously enrich and improve them in practice. But its main key is to promote collective labor suitable for the profession and suitable for large-scale production, establish a collective production responsibility system, and also allow certain farm work to be the responsibility of individuals.

    (3) Evaluation of Work and Recording Points: The production team and the work team mainly implement the evaluation of work and recording points for the commune members. This is a good way to give play to the production enthusiasm of the masses and implement the policy of more pay for more work. Some places in Henan Province have continued to adopt the method of basic wages plus bonuses, which should be continued and experience summarized. For the evaluation of work and recording points, in specific implementation, forms such as fixed points and flexible evaluation, recording work by piece, and fixed points and fixed recording are flexibly adopted according to different farm work. After the task is completed, work tickets are issued to the commune members, and small summaries are made every ten days, and a final summary is made at the end of the month, and wages are paid according to work points. With the gradual development of tool reform and semi-mechanization and mechanization, it is necessary to continuously revise labor quotas and improve labor efficiency, so that labor quotas are adapted to the new situation of technological innovation.

    (4) Carrying forward the communist spirit and implementing labor cooperation is an effective experience in organizing large-scale production, and must be continued. The forms of cooperation are generally: several brigades jointly organize labor, jointly raise funds, and cooperate in carrying out basic construction; when a production team fails to complete the production task, other teams are organized to cooperate; in order to complete a certain sudden production task, large-scale operations are organized, such as rushing to harvest and plant, and overcoming natural disasters. When carrying out labor cooperation, attention should be paid to solving the contradiction between cooperation and the production team's contracted work plan. According to the experience of various places, there are four ways to solve this contradiction: (1) According to the farming season, the commune and the team need to formulate a cooperation plan, and include the cooperative labor in the annual contracted work and labor allocation plan. (2) The production team draws 5%-10% of the mobile labor to form a cooperative specialized group or a commando group, who participate in cooperation when there is something to do, and participate in the production of this team when there is nothing to do. (3) When it is necessary to draw more labor to participate in cooperation, it should be drawn proportionally according to the amount of labor in each team, and should not be over-concentrated. (4) The team and the team sign a cooperation contract, help each other, exchange work, and support each other. No matter what form is adopted, the principle of equivalent exchange and distribution according to work should be resolutely implemented.

    (5) Strengthening planning management, democratic management, and financial management:

    Strengthen planning management. The people's commune is the organizer of production and also the organizer of life. Production, exchange, consumption, and accumulation must be planned. People's communes, production brigades, and production teams should formulate plans for industrial and agricultural production, labor, finance, and distribution according to the state plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions. Through planning, mobilize all positive factors and promote the comprehensive, high-speed, and proportionate development of industrial and agricultural production.

    Strengthen democratic management. Commune members participate in the discussion of the production plan, commune members participate in the formulation of labor quotas, commune members participate in the acceptance of the quality of farm work, commune members participate in the opinions of labor allocation, give full play to democracy, and mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members. At the same time, we must educate commune members to abide by labor discipline: obey the leadership, listen to commands, not be late, not leave early, not be absent from work without reason; ensure quality and quantity, complete tasks; safeguard collective interests, cherish public property; cooperate with each other, unite and love each other, and strive to be model commune members.

    Strengthen financial management and establish and improve financial systems. First, establish a financial budget and final accounting system. Strengthen the concept of economic accounting and pay attention to economic results. Second, establish an expenditure approval system. Use funds reasonably and reduce non-productive expenditures. Third, establish a grain management system. Communes and teams must strengthen grain management, establish grain management institutions, and implement the four-warehouse management method of ration grain, seed grain, feed grain, and reserve grain. Seed grain, feed grain, and reserve grain are managed by the people's commune and the production brigade respectively. The ration grain index of commune members should be allocated to households, the grain should be distributed to the canteen, and the savings should belong to the commune members themselves. Fourth, establish a system for the safekeeping and use of materials and tools. Fifth, financial openness. Income distribution, production costs, public accumulation, labor work points, food management, etc. must be cleared daily and settled monthly, and announced regularly. Sixth, purify the financial team and actively absorb poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in financial work. Each special area and county should hold short-term training courses to train financial and grain management personnel, improve the financial guidance system, and establish a financial guidance network (station) to do a good job in the financial work of the people's communes.

              On the Issue of Income Distribution

    The distribution and final accounting work of the people's communes in Henan Province is normal and healthy. Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1959, the diversification of operations was well grasped. As a result of the distribution, the state procurement task was completed, public accumulation was increased, it was ensured that more than 90% of commune members increased their income, and more than 20% of the people's communes had grain reserves. In the distribution, the spirit of the basic team ownership and the partial commune ownership was further embodied, the mutual relations between the state, the people's communes, the production brigades and the commune members were properly handled, and the principles of distribution according to work and equivalent exchange were implemented. Before the year, in conjunction with the distribution, the life of the commune members was comprehensively arranged once, thereby ensuring the vigorous production enthusiasm of the masses.

      (1) Correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption. The amount of accumulation and the speed of improvement in the level of consumption are mainly determined by two factors: one is determined by production, and the other is determined by distribution. Our principle should be: on the basis of production development, ensure that more than 90% of the commune members increase their income on the premise of actively expanding public accumulation. The distribution work of the people's communes in Henan Province in 1959 accounted for 45.4% of all deductions, and 54.6% of the distribution of commune members. Among them, in cash crop areas and urban suburbs, all deductions and commune member distribution accounted for 50% each, and in a few disaster areas and poor teams, all deductions accounted for 35% and commune member distribution accounted for 65%. This ratio is appropriate.

    The current issue that should be paid attention to is that the current production is not completely stable, the basic life of the masses must be guaranteed, and the living standards of commune members must be gradually improved. Therefore, too much cannot be deducted now, and the deduction ratio should be gradually increased in the future with the development of production on the premise of ensuring that more than 90% of commune members increase their income.

      (2) In order to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the people's communes, the production brigades and the commune members, according to the experience of various places, in the process of distribution, on the basis of mobilizing the masses to verify the output, according to the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the state procurement task and ensure the life of the commune members, and on the premise of continuous development of production, achieve "cultivating three and surplus one," and that all communes have grain reserves. Generally, the national public grain task should be completed first; and the amount of ration grain, seed grain, and feed grain should be reserved according to the standards stipulated by the state; ensure the completion of the national unified purchase task; and appropriately arrange reserve grain. The distribution work of the people's commune itself should first deduct ration grain, feed grain, seeds, and wages, and then extract public accumulation in proportion.

    The distribution work should adopt the method of pre-distribution and then final accounting, and distributing grain first and then distributing money. There should be two pre-distributions after the summer and autumn harvests each year, and the final accounting should be carried out at the end of the year, and all should be completed before the end of December. The distribution indicators are generally allocated according to the expected actual output of 80%-85%, and the remaining part is uniformly settled at the time of final accounting. Each year before the summer and autumn harvests, the county, people's commune, and production brigade should formulate a distribution plan; after the summer and autumn harvests, the first secretary should take the lead, and the leading cadres, the masses, and accounting personnel should be combined to focus on the distribution work. Meetings of cadres and representatives of people's communes should be held to implement policies, verify output, and distribute, so as to combine the inside and outside of the meeting, combine the leadership and the masses; carry out free and frank discussions, and exchange policies; calculate accounts, purchase grain, and distribute, combining rich harvests, collection, management, and use; and solve the problems of national procurement, people's commune accumulation, commune member distribution, three guarantees and one reward, and life arrangements in a unified way.

    (3) The distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system is the socialist distribution system according to work, in which the supply part has communist factors. Practice over the past year or so has proved that this distribution system is suitable for the current development of productive forces. In most production brigades in Henan Province, the wage part accounts for 60% and the supply part accounts for 40%. The supply part is slightly larger in a few poor teams and disaster-stricken teams. This ratio is appropriate. In terms of the wage system, most areas have insisted on paying wages on a monthly basis; some areas pay them once every few months or once a quarter. Insisting on paying wages on time is the main form of embodying the principle of distribution according to work. It is the urgent requirement of the vast number of commune members and has a great effect on stimulating commune members' enthusiasm for production and promoting the development of production. According to the experience of various places, to ensure that wages are paid on time, it must be done: first, organize special labor and engage in diversified operations to ensure that there is always monetary income. Second, the people's communes and production brigades must always maintain a certain amount of the wage fund. It is necessary to establish a separate project for special purposes. Third, the wages that should be paid to commune members must be guaranteed to be paid to the workers themselves. Fourth, if the problems of oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and coal used by the canteen can be solved or basically solved in the small part of the ownership of the production team and the home production of the canteen, the production brigade can focus on guaranteeing the payment of wages. The method of the production brigade paying wages to the production team is mostly to pre-pay on a monthly basis according to the total number of contracted work, and some are paid according to the wage level of the labor force. In terms of the supply system, the production brigades in the province that implement the food supply system account for 39.6%; the production brigades that implement the grain supply system and the basic grain supply system account for 46.5%; and the production brigades that implement the half-grain supply system account for 13.8%. The supply system has guaranteed the lives of commune members and has shown its great superiority. The masses are very satisfied. However, with the development of production, the half-grain supply system should be gradually changed to the full-grain supply system, and the grain supply system should be gradually improved to the food supply system according to the actual conditions in various places.

      (4) The issue of the home production of public canteens. Over the past year or so, the home production of public canteens in Henan Province has greatly developed, which has played a great role in improving the lives of commune members and consolidating public canteens. Practice has proved that developing canteen home production is a good experience. The so-called canteen home production refers to the vegetable land operated by the canteen itself, the livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens and ducks raised by the canteen, the small workshops such as tofu workshops, powder workshops, and pickled vegetable gardens run by the canteen, and the surplus part of the canteen. This part of the production is self-sufficient and is mainly used for collective consumption in the canteen to improve the lives of commune members. It is a supplement to the supply system and has communist factors. The experience of doing a good job in home production is mainly: first, adhere to the production policy of self-sufficiency, and carry it out on the premise of ensuring the collective production of the production team. It is not allowed to engage in commercial activities, and the surplus part should be sold to the state. At present, large-scale collective pig raising has just developed, and canteen pig raising should first guarantee the needs of the state, and then be self-sufficient. Second, the home production of the canteen and the small part of the ownership of the production team should generally be separated, and separate accounts should be established and managed separately. Some of them are doing very well together, and there is no need to force them to separate, but the accounts should be announced to the masses regularly. Third, the labor force for home production should mainly rely on the spare time of the chefs, or the labor saved by the reform of cooking utensils. When necessary, the production team can mobilize auxiliary labor or organize and use the time before and after the commune members' meals to help. The production costs and feed mainly rely on self-reliance, and the brigade and the production team can temporarily borrow a small amount of funds when there are difficulties. Fourth, the specific uses of home production are mainly to solve the expenses of oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, vegetables, fuel, etc. in the canteen; expand home production investment; repair the restaurant; and add and repair canteen cooking utensils; and extract a certain proportion as a bonus for personnel participating in home production. Fifth, the party branch and the team committee of the production team should have a special person responsible for leading the canteen home production, relying on the masses, democratically managing, and publishing accounts regularly. For home production, we should actively strengthen leadership, summarize experience, and constantly consolidate and improve it, but we must also pay attention to ensuring that it is carried out on the premise of doing a good job in the collective production of the production team.

        On Strengthening the Leadership of People's Communes

    The issue of developing the commune economy, the issue of business management, and the issue of income distribution are important links in the current consolidation and development of people's communes, but the most important thing is political and ideological work. We must adhere to the principle of combining putting politics in command and material interests, but at any time we must put political work in the first place. The struggle between the two roads is long-term, and the education of farmers is also long-term. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and constantly conduct socialist and communist education to commune members, education on the Party's general line for socialist construction, education on the worker-peasant alliance, education on loving the country and loving the community and safeguarding collective interests, and establish the forward-looking thinking of continuous revolution. At the same time, we must be vigilant to prevent the attacks of capitalist ideology and resolutely fight against capitalist ideology. Resolutely change the political outlook of backward teams and establish the absolute leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants. We must strengthen the leadership of weak areas, decentralize cadres, and send working groups to go deep into the grassroots, and require that the face of backward teams be completely changed in the first half of this year.

    The central link in consolidating and developing people's communes lies in the high-speed development of agricultural production. We must fully mobilize the masses, muster greater enthusiasm, and adhere to the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery production. We must carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, fully implement the "eight-character constitution" for agricultural production increase, properly arrange labor, and improve labor efficiency. At present, spring plowing production has already begun. We should focus on grasping wheat field management, overcoming spring drought, striving for a bumper wheat harvest, and making practical preparations for spring plowing production to ensure timely cultivation and set off a larger-scale production upsurge.

    On the basis of the rectification movement, improving the level of leadership and improving the style of cadres, and further strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, is also an important guarantee for consolidating and developing people's communes. Continue to adhere to the system of cadres taking turns to be commune members, and continue to carry forward the excellent style of cadres and the masses eating, living, working, and discussing together. In our work, we must adhere to the Party's mass line, and the greater the task and the busier the work, the more we must consult with the masses on everything. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must care about the lives of the masses and pay attention to the combination of work and rest. All tasks must not only be done vigorously, but also be solid; they must not only have soaring enthusiasm, but also have a spirit of scientific analysis. And we must fully utilize the holding of on-site meetings, holding exhibitions, organizing counseling groups, and promoting advanced experience. Leading cadres must engage in experimental fields and high-yield plots, participate in production and lead production. We must insert red flags, set up pacesetters, and carry out the red flag competition movement of "learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping."

    The people's communes in Henan Province have embarked on a more consolidated and healthy development stage. With the development of the socialist construction cause, especially the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the great development of the people's commune economy, many new problems will inevitably arise that we need to study and solve. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious light of the General Line, the people's communes will definitely be run better, and its future is infinitely bright.

    关于巩固和发展人民公社的几个问题
    中共河南省委书记处书记　史向生
    人民公社经过一年半的成长壮大，已经在中国的大地上开花结果，从各方面充分显示了它的旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性。我国国民经济连续两年的高速度发展，是和人民公社的建立、巩固和发展分不开的。我国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，找到了人民公社这一最好的社会组织形式，它不仅能引导农民由目前的基本队所有制逐步过渡到基本社所有制，由社会主义的集体所有制逐步过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，而且又能在将来由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义。我们有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，我国社会主义建设事业就能够无往而不胜。这是毛主席和党中央创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的结果，是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。河南省一千二百一十个人民公社和三十三万多个公共食堂，经过贯彻执行中央郑州会议精神，进行了系统的整顿和巩固工作；经过一年多来生产实践和严重自然灾害的考验；去冬以来，又经过了整党、整社运动，系统地进行了社会主义教育，已经走上了更加巩固和健全发展的道路。它将进一步促进河南省整个国民经济的持续大跃进。人民公社在发展过程中，出现了许多新的问题，需要进一步研究解决。这里，仅就发展公社经济、经营管理、收入分配等方面谈一些意见。
    关于发展公社经济的问题
    目前，河南省人民公社实行的三级管理、队为基础的体制，是适应当前生产力发展需要和群众觉悟水平的，对于人民公社的巩固和健全发展起了巨大作用。随着生产的发展，由基本队所有制过渡到基本社所有制，并进而由社会主义的集体所有制逐步过渡到社会主义全民所有制，这是政治经济发展的必然趋势。一年来，河南省人民公社的社有经济、生产大队和生产队的经济，都有了很大发展。公社一级经济占总产值的16．4％，生产大队占72．7％，生产队占6．4％。1959年公社的公共积累比1958年增长一倍。此外，社员家庭副业收入占4．5％。目前公社所有制虽然还是部分的，但是它是带动人民公社整个生产继续向前发展的核心力量和主要的物质基础，是代表着人民公社的伟大希望和伟大前途。看不到这个趋势和发展方向，没有不断革命的指导思想，这显然是错误的。但是也必须认识，人民公社更进一步的巩固和发展，“必须以一定程度的生产力发展为基础。生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质，只有生产力发展到某种状况才会引起生产关系的某种变革”。因此，我们必须大力发展生产力，贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展多种经济，实行商品性生产和自给性生产同时并举，种植业和畜牧业同时并举，农业和公社工业同时并举的两条腿走路的方针，高速度地发展农业生产。就河南省情况来说，当前的主要任务是充分发挥基本队所有制的潜力和作用，促进生产的发展；同时，要积极地、逐步地发展社有经济，帮助穷队赶上富队，逐步实现农业半机械化、机械化，继续不断地加强对社员的政治教育，提高社员的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，以便从经济上、组织上、思想上打下继续不断前进的坚实基础。我们必须遵照党中央和毛主席所指示的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理，来指导人民公社经济的发展，更好、更快地巩固和发展人民公社。
    发展社有经济，主要是依靠扩大公共积累和发展社办企业。要充分发挥现有社办企业的劳力、资金、设备、资源等潜力，因地制宜，就地取材，自力更生积极发展。实践证明，适当发展社有经济，对于发展生产，壮大社有制巩固人民公社，都起了重大作用。特别是社办工业，一般占社有经济的80％左右，它对于加速农业技术改造，实现公社工业化，更具有重大意义。发展社有经济，可以采取多种多样的形式：（一）社有社营。主要是发展社办厂矿、农业机械站、电力站、农业试验场、大型林业、畜牧、园艺、渔场以及短途运输等。（二）社队合营或社有队营。主要是发展较小规模的与农业生产有密切联系的肥料厂、家畜家禽饲养场、副食品加工厂等。其具体办法，一是公社投资，生产队出劳力，收益分成；二是社队共同投资，生产队出劳力，收益分成。（三）队与队联合经营。主要是发展适宜于生产大队兴办而一个大队又无力兴办的牧场、林场、园艺场等。（四）社办农场、林场、牧场、渔场以及各种专业队等。这些场、队是作为人民公社的直属企业或承包单位，实行几包几定或三包一奖制。由人民公社统一领导，统一核算，工资、供给也由人民公社负责。（五）国家和公社合营。主要是国家财贸部门和人民公社合办的加工企业，统一领导，收入分成。有些地区，县、社共同集资，举办化肥厂、综合农、牧场等。以上这几种形式，可以因地制宜，创造经验。
    河南省原有六千三百余个穷队，已经赶上富队的占23．8％，赶上了一般队的占48．1％。应该继续加强对穷队的领导和支持，力争在今年内基本上消灭穷队。要发动和教育穷队的干部与社员，树雄心，立大志，发奋图强，自力更生。认真总结穷队赶富队的经验，分析原因，抓住关键，因地制宜地全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔生产。健全党的组织，充分发动群众，巩固贫农和下中农的领导优势，切实改变某些生产队的政治落后面貌。国家今年投资于人民公社的资金，必须以不少于60％的部分用于扶持穷队发展生产。人民公社也可以根据具体情况拿出一定资金支持穷队。各级党委和有关部门，必须把穷队赶富队的工作列入议事日程，作出规划，指定专人负责，定期检查，加强具体领导。穷队赶上富队的标准大体有四个：一是水利和基本建设等生产条件基本上改变面貌；二是单位面积产量、社员平均收入和富队基本趋于平衡；三是生产稳定上升，并且有一定的粮食储备；四是落后队要加以改造，健全党、团组织，树立贫农、下中农的领导优势。
    在发展社有经济的同时，必须发展生产大队的经济。必须在充分发挥大队经济的积极性的条件下来适当发展社有经济，无论在资金的安排、生产资料的调拨和劳动力的调配等等方面，都要既照顾到社有经济的发展，又照顾到队有经济的发展。目前，生产大队的经济，仍有很大的潜力，特别是发展农业生产，主要还是依靠生产大队，应该大力促进其发展。这对于发展生产，壮大社有经济巩固发展人民公社，都有很大的作用。社有经济和生产大队经济，要统筹兼顾，全面安排，适当分工。凡是由生产大队举办较为有利的，应当由生产大队去办。有些项目由人民公社经营更为有利时，应当经过酝酿，通过一定会议作出决定，并且按照等价交换的原则，由社队合营或公社经营。
    生产队的小部分所有制，对于发挥生产队的生产积极性，挖掘生产潜力，发展生产，增加社员收入，仍有一定作用。根据河南省执行的情况，生产队小部分所有制一般占生产大队总收入5％—10％。这个比例是适当的。这部分所有制的收入，主要是超产奖励。在保证完成生产大队分配的任务和服从国家市场管理的前提下，生产队可以经营零星土地、小型鱼塘、小宗副业生产。
    关于经营管理问题
    一年多来，河南省人民公社的经营管理工作有很大提高，各地创造了不少经验，实行了许多好的管理办法。特别是在全省范围内广泛深入地批判了少数地区“包工包产到户”的错误作法，划清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的界限，明确了前进的方向，从而使人民公社的经营管理工作得到了新的发展。这对河南各级党组织和人民群众都有极大的教育意义，对于人民公社的巩固和发展起了重大的作用。目前，在生产和劳动管理方面，绝大多数生产大队对生产队实行了三包一奖制；生产队建立集体生产责任制，对作业组实行定额小段包工；对社员实行评工记分办法。实践证明，这些办法是很好的，既能充分发挥生产队和社员的生产积极性，又能建立明确的生产责任制。
    （一）三包一奖制：
    包产——根据国家计划，上一年度的实产以及生产条件变化等情况，按照积极可靠，留有余地的精神，确定包产指标。包产指标，一般应相当于上年实产或比上年实产稍高一些。粮食作物包面积、单产、总产，经济作物还要包产值。林、牧、副、渔各业也按任务和产值分别包到承包单位。包产的方法，一种是由生产大队统一划方定产，一种是将生产队划分类型按比例定产。
    包工——多数是根据生产任务，生产条件，各种农作物操作规程，劳动定额和劳力负担能力，确定总包工数，并且按包工总数适当包杂活工，余工归队，超工不补。少数是根据承包单位的劳力多少，出勤天数，计算出总劳动日，作为总包工数；杂活用工，实报实销。两种办法以前一种较好。包工后，如果遇有特大自然灾害和农田基本建设用工过多时，可以适当增加包工数。副业包工有三种办法：一是以收入定工（定价格、定质量）；二是按完成任务多少提成奖励；三是畜牧业实行五定二奖，即定领导、定任务、定膘情、定工分、定繁殖，增膘奖、繁殖奖。
    包投资——多数是种籽、饲料、化肥、农药、烤烟用煤等由大队统一掌握，但必须专款专用，按生产季节分配到生产队。小件农具修补费、灯油费、办公费、牲口医药费等，一般有三种办法：一种是直接包给生产队，由生产队掌握使用，节约归队，超者不补。另一种是资金指标分到生产队，不付现金，由大队统一掌握，生产队按计划领取实物。还有一种是按地亩平均包投资。上述三种办法，以第一种为好。
    奖励办法——各人民公社普遍执行了多奖少罚的原则。多数生产队是超产的，得了奖；少数队减产，分别不同情况，也作了处理。超产部分的分配，多数队按照二、三、五的比例（大队二十、生产队三十、社员五十），部分队按照三、二、五的比例，个别队按照三、三、四的比例。在目前情况下，一般以第一种比例较适当。正确贯彻执行多奖少罚的原则，应作到以下几点：第一，在分配时，必须首先做好政治思想工作，发动群众，报实产量。只要没有其他特殊情况，应该作到使多数队有产可超，有奖可得。第二，夏季预奖，全年统算。一般应奖励现金，在完成国家征购任务前提下，也可以奖一部分粮食。第三，有些生产队虽然没有完成包产任务，但是比上年增产，或者抗拒自然灾害成绩显著，也可给予适当的物质奖或荣誉奖。第四，对减产队要分析原因，条件具备但因主观努力不够而减产者，必须受罚。因为包产指标过高，严重自然灾害袭击等原因而造成减产者，一般不予处罚。
    总之，三包一奖制是人民公社经营管理工作中的重大问题，是实现国家计划的重要保证。在领导上必须贯彻全年，抓紧抓好，一次包好，落实到生产队。这样，就能进一步调动广大社员的生产积极性、主动性，保证生产计划的实现。由于作物种植计划和生产条件的不断变化，应该在春播前后、夏收夏种前后、秋收秋种前后，进行三次检查修订。秋后分配决算时，最后核定。在进行这一工作时，必须坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，召开代表会议，进行分析和研究，既要鼓足干劲，又要留有余地，既要有先进指标，又要有积极可靠的措施。目前应该结合春季生产和整社工作，把今年的三包工作认真检查一次，特别是对小麦和春播作物的三包工作，必须确实做好。
    （二）建立与健全集体生产责任制：
    建立和健全集体生产责任制，加强劳动管理，是发展生产，巩固提高人民公社的重要问题。随着生产高速度发展和适应大集体生产方式的需要，生产管理、劳动组织必须逐步实现生产基地化，劳动专业化。目前生产队的劳动组织，应当以常年作业组为主，并且根据需要建立各种类型的专业队（组）。生产队一般应根据作业组和所辖范围，划分若干个作业区进行管理。
    生产队对作业组或专业队主要推行定额小段包工的集体生产责任制。其作法：第一，生产队统一计划，统一领导，统一定额，根据季节、农活、作业范围提出小段生产计划，向作业组或专业队进行包工。第二，组织生产，开展劳动竞赛。第三，在实现小段包工过程中，生产队应根据情况，对劳力、牲口、农具进行适当调剂。第四，评比验收，表扬先进。大农活由队验收，小农活由小组验收。第五，在坚持集体劳动为主的原则下，对于某些不适于集体操作的农活，可以由个人去做，责任到人。例如管理零星果木，收集粪便等。
    上述办法，也不是一成不变的。各地可以因地制宜，在实践过程中，不断丰富和提高。但其主要关键是发扬适合专业、适合大生产的集体劳动，建立集体生产责任制，同时也允许某些农活责任到人。
    （三）评工记分：生产队、作业组对社员主要实行评工记分。这是目前发挥群众生产积极性，贯彻执行多劳多得政策的好办法。河南省有些地方继续采用了基本工资加奖励的办法，应该继续实行，总结经验。对于评工记分，在具体执行中，主要是根据农活的不同，灵活采用死分活评、按件记工、死分死记等形式。在任务完成后，发给社员工票，按旬小结，月终总结，按工发资。随着工具改革和半机械化、机械化的逐步发展，要不断修订劳动定额，提高劳动效率，使劳动定额与技术革新的新情况相适应。
    （四）发扬共产主义精神，实行劳动协作，是组织大生产的一项行之有效的好经验，必须继续坚持。协作的形式一般是：几个大队统一组织劳力，统一筹集资金，协作进行基本建设；某一个生产队生产任务完不成时，组织其他队进行协作；为了完成某项突击性生产，组织大兵团作战，如进行抢收抢种，战胜自然灾害等。在进行劳动协作时，要注意解决协作和生产队包工计划之间的矛盾。根据各地经验，解决这个矛盾的办法有四个：（1）根据农事季节，需要社、队制订协作计划，把协作用工列入全年包工和劳动调配计划之内。（2）生产队抽出5％—10％的机动劳力组成协作专业组或突击组，有事参加协作，无事参加本队生产。（3）需要抽调较多劳力参加协作时，应根据各队劳力多少，按比例抽调，不要过分集中。（4）队与队订立协作合同，互相帮工、换工，有来有往，互相支援。不论采取哪种形式，都应当坚决执行等价交换、按劳分配的原则。
      （五）加强计划管理、民主管理和财务管理：
    加强计划管理。人民公社是生产的组织者，又是生活的组织者。生产、交换、消费和积累，都必须有计划。人民公社、生产大队和生产队，都应当根据国家计划和因地制宜的原则，制订工农业生产计划和劳力、财务、分配计划。通过规划，调动一切积极因素，促进工农业生产全面的、高速度按比例的发展。
    加强民主管理。生产计划社员参加讨论，劳动定额社员参加制定，农活质量社员参加验收，劳力调配社员参加意见，充分发扬民主，调动社员的积极性。同时，要教育社员遵守劳动纪律：服从领导，听从指挥，不迟到，不早退，不无故旷工缺勤；保质保量，完成任务；维护集体利益，爱护公共财产；互相协作，团结友爱，争取当模范社员。
    加强财务管理，建立与健全财务制度。第一，建立财务预决算制度。加强经济核算观念，注意经济效果。第二，建立开支审批制度。合理使用资金，减少非生产性开支。第三，建立粮食管理制度。社、队要加强粮食管理工作，建立粮食管理机构，实行口粮、种籽、饲料、储备粮四分仓的管理办法。种籽、饲料、储备粮，分别由人民公社、生产大队管理，社员口粮指标应分配到户，粮食分到食堂，节约归社员自己。第四，建立物资和工具保管使用制度。第五，财务公开。收入分配、生产费用、公共积累、劳动工分、伙食管理等，要日清月结，定期公布。第六，纯洁财务队伍，积极吸收贫农、下中农参加财务工作。各专、县要举办短期训练班，训练财务、粮食管理人员，健全财务辅导制度，建立财务辅导网（站），以作好人民公社的财务工作。
              关于收益分配问题
    河南省人民公社的分配决算工作，是正常的、健康的。由于1959年农业生产的持续大跃进，多种经营抓得好，分配的结果，完成了国家征购任务，增加了公共积累，保证了90％以上的社员增加收入，并且有20％以上的人民公社存有储备粮。在分配中，进一步体现了基本队有制和部分社有制的精神，妥善处理了国家、人民公社、生产大队和社员之间的相互关系，贯彻执行了按劳分配、等价交换的原则。年前结合分配，又全面安排了一次社员生活，从而保证了群众的旺盛的生产情绪。
      （一）正确处理积累和消费的关系。积累的多少和消费水平的提高的快慢，主要决定于两个因素：一是决定于生产，二是决定于分配。我们的原则应当是：在生产发展的基础上，保证90％以上社员增加收入的前提下，积极扩大公共积累。河南省人民公社1959年的分配工作，各项扣除占45．4％，社员分配占54．6％。其中经济作物区和城市郊区，各项扣除和社员分配各占50％，少数灾区和穷队，各项扣除占35％，社员分配占65％，这个比例是适当的。
    当前应该注意的问题，是现在生产还不完全稳定，群众基本生活必须保证，而且还要使社员生活水平逐步有所提高。因此，现在还不能扣除过多，今后应该随着生产的发展，在保证90％以上社员增加收入的前提下，逐步增加扣除比例。
      （二）为了正确处理好国家、人民公社、生产大队和社员的关系，根据各地经验，在分配的过程中，要在发动群众核实产量的基础上，根据统筹兼顾，全面安排的方针，既要保证完成国家征购任务，又要保证社员生活，并在生产不断发展的前提下，做到耕三余一，社社都有储备粮。一般应先完成国家公粮任务；并且按照国家规定的标准，留够口粮、种籽、饲料；保证完成国家统购任务；适当安排储备粮。人民公社本身的分配工作，应当首先扣除口粮、饲料、种子、工资以后，再按比例提取公共积累。
    分配工作，应该采取先预分后决算，先分粮后分钱的办法。在每年的夏收秋收后，进行两次预分，年终进行决算，在12月底以前全部结束。分配指标，一般按预计实产80％—85％进行分配，其余部分在决算时统一结算。每年在夏收秋收之前，县、人民公社、生产大队要制定分配方案；在夏收秋收之后，要由第一书记挂帅，领导干部、群众、财会人员三结合，集中抓好分配工作。要召开干部会和人民公社代表会，贯彻政策，核实产量，进行分配，作到会内会外相结合，领导与群众相结合；开展鸣放辩论，交心交底交政策；边算账、边征购、边分配，丰产丰收，收、管、用相结合；统一解决国家征购、人民公社积累、社员分配、三包一奖、生活安排等问题，一次落实，一气呵成。
    （三）工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，是社会主义的按劳分配制度，其中供给部分则带有共产主义因素。一年多来的实践证明，这种分配制度是适合当前生产力的发展的。河南省大多数生产大队工资部分占60％，供给部分占40％。少数穷队和受灾队供给部分稍大一些。这个比例，是适当的。在工资制方面，大多数地区坚持了按月发工资；部分地区几个月发一次或一季度发一次。坚持按期发放工资是体现按劳分配原则的主要形式，是广大社员的迫切要求，对激发社员生产积极性，促进生产发展都有很大作用。根据各地经验，保证按期发放工资，必须作到：第一，组织专门劳力，大搞多种经营，保证经常有货币收入。第二，人民公社和生产大队都要经常保持一定数目的工资基金。要另立项目，专款专用。第三，应该发给社员的工资保证要发到劳动者本人手里。第四，如能在生产队小部分所有制和食堂家底生产中，解决或基本解决了食堂的油、盐、酱、醋和用煤问题，生产大队就可以把重点放在保证发放工资上。生产大队对生产队发放工资办法，多数是按包工总数按月预发，也有的是按劳动力的工资级别发放。在供给制方面，全省实行伙食供给制的生产大队占39．6％；实行粮食供给制和基本粮食供给制的生产大队占46．5％；实行半粮食供给制的生产大队占13．8％。供给制保证了社员生活，已经显示了它的巨大优越性，群众十分满意。但是，随着生产的发展，应该根据各地实际情况，努力地把半粮食供给制逐步改变为全粮食供给制，把粮食供给制逐步提高为伙食供给制。
      （四）公共食堂家底生产问题。一年多来，河南省公共食堂的家底生产有很大发展，对于改善社员生活，巩固公共食堂发挥了很大作用。实践证明，发展食堂家底生产，是一条好经验。所谓食堂家底生产，就是食堂自己经营的蔬菜地，食堂饲养的猪、羊、鸡、鸭等家畜家禽，食堂举办的自给性的豆腐坊、粉坊、酱菜园等小型作坊，以及食堂的节余部分。这部分生产，是自给性的，主要用于食堂集体消费，改善社员生活。它是供给制的补充，带有共产主义因素。搞好家底生产的经验主要是：第一，坚持自给性的生产方针，在保证搞好生产队集体生产的前提下进行，不得从事商业活动，多余部分应当卖给国家，目前大集体养猪刚刚发展起来，食堂养猪仍应首先保证国家需要，而后自给。第二，食堂家底生产和生产队小部分所有制，一般应当分开，单独建账，分别管理。有的在一起搞得很好的，也不必强求分开，但要定期向群众公布账目。第三，家底生产的劳动力，主要应靠炊事人员的业余时间，或利用炊具改革节省的劳力担负。必要时，生产队可以发动辅助劳力或组织利用社员饭前饭后的时间给以帮助。生产费用和饲料，主要依靠自力更生解决，有困难时，大队和生产队可以暂借少量资金。第四，家底生产的具体用途，主要是解决食堂的油、盐、酱、醋、菜、燃料等费用；扩大家底生产投资；修补餐厅；添置、修理食堂炊具；抽出一定比例作为参加家底生产人员奖励金。第五，生产队党支部和队委会要有专人负责领导食堂家底生产，依靠群众，民主管理，并且定期公布账目。对于家底生产，应当积极加强领导，总结经验，不断巩固提高，但是也要注意，必须在保证搞好生产队集体生产的前提下进行，不能无限制地扩大，更不能削弱生产大队和生产队的所有制来扩大食堂家底生产。
        关于加强人民公社的领导问题
    关于发展公社经济问题，经营管理问题，收益分配问题，是当前巩固发展人民公社的重要环节，但是更主要的还是政治思想工作。必须坚持政治挂帅和物质利益相结合的原则，但是，任何时候都必须把政治工作放在首要地位。两条道路斗争是长期的，对农民教育也是长期的。必须以毛泽东思想为指导，经常地向社员进行社会主义、共产主义教育，党的社会主义建设总路线的教育，工农联盟的教育，爱国爱社和维护集体利益的教育，树立不断革命的前进思想。同时，要提高警惕，防止资本主义思想的袭击，并对资本主义思想进行坚决斗争。坚决改变落后队的政治面貌，树立贫农、下中农的绝对领导优势。必须加强对薄弱地区的领导，下放干部、派遣工作组，深入基层，要求今年上半年彻底改变落后队的面貌。
    巩固和发展人民公社的中心环节，在于高速度地发展农业生产。必须充分发动群众，鼓足更大干劲，坚持以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的方针。大搞技术革新和技术革命，全面贯彻执行农业增产“八字宪法”，妥善安排劳力，提高劳动效率。目前春耕生产已经开始，应当突出抓紧麦田管理，战胜春旱，争取小麦大丰收，并且切实作好春耕生产准备，保证适时耕种，掀起更大规模的生产高潮。
    在整风运动的基础上，提高领导水平，改进干部作风，进一步密切党和群众的关系，也是巩固与发展人民公社的一项重要保证。继续坚持干部轮流下放当社员的制度，继续发扬干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的优良作风。在工作中，必须坚持党的群众路线，任务越大，工作越忙，越要遇事同群众商量。群众干劲越大，越要关心群众生活，注意劳逸结合。各项工作既要搞得轰轰烈烈，又要扎扎实实；既要有冲天干劲，又要有科学分析的精神。并且要充分运用召开现场会议，举办展览馆，组织辅导团，推广先进经验。领导干部要大搞试验田、丰产方，参加生产领导生产。要插红旗，树标兵，开展“学、赶、超、帮”的红旗竞赛运动。
    河南省人民公社已经走上了更加巩固和健全发展的阶段，随着社会主义建设事业的发展，尤其是农业生产的连续大跃进，人民公社经济的大发展，必然会出现许多新的问题，要我们去研究去解决。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，人民公社一定能够办得更好，它的前途是无限光明的。
