    For Sixty-One Class Brothers
    Collective Creation by the Central Academy of Fine Arts
    I. Accident: Food Poisoning
    Sixty-one laborers constructing a highway near Zhangcun in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, unfortunately suffered from food poisoning. The county party committee dispatched people to rush to the rescue.
    II. Saving Brothers: Perilous Crossing of the Yellow River
    Treatment required the special medicine "Dimercaprol." The county party secretary sent people to find the medicine. The boatmen broke the old rule of the Yellow River never ceasing its ferry service, sailing directly to Sanmenxia City.
    III. To Beijing: Urgent Telegram for Help
    After searching everywhere nearby, the special medicine could not be found. The county party committee decided to ask the capital for help.
    IV. Ministry of Health: Decisive Action
    After receiving the call, the Ministry of Health decided to immediately prepare the medicine and contacted the Air Force and others to request support in delivering the medicine.
    V. Special Pharmacy: Medicine Delivered by Car
    The Beijing Bamiancao Special Medicine Store, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched people to transport the special medicine from a warehouse thirty miles away.
    VI. Offering Good Advice: Clever Installation of Lights
    In order to install lighting equipment for the airdropped medicine box, employees of the Beijing Wuzhou Electrical Goods Store quickly devised a way to equip the medicine box with electric lights.
    VII. Comforting Relatives: Affection as Deep as the Sea
    Commune members of Zhangcun Commune in Pinglu County brought a large number of comforting gifts from all directions to the poisoned laborers.
    VIII. Medicine Dropped: Cheers from the Crowd
    Pilots of an Air Force unit overcame various difficulties and transported the medicine box from Beijing to the skies above Pinglu County, using parachutes to drop it at the designated location.
    IX. Celebrating New Life: Credit Belongs to the Party
    The "miracle drug" was very effective, and the sixty-one class brothers escaped danger. Old Man Wu said excitedly to his son: "Chairman Mao is your real parent!"
    X. Singing Triumphant Songs: Eternally Passed Down
    The poisoned laborers quickly recovered their health and returned to the construction site, throwing themselves into the battle with even greater enthusiasm. This song of communist triumph will be passed down for eternity.
