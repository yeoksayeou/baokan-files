    A Sea of Flowers, A World of "Kings"
    By our reporter, Yu Jingqi

    In March, with the spring deep, the Chengdu Plain is at the peak season for exuberant growth of vegetation and the blooming of all kinds of flowers. The more than 40,000 mu of rapeseed in Xindu County, after a winter of careful cultivation, have all entered the flowering period. Crowds of people from various counties in the province and even many provinces across the country come to visit in an endless stream. Here, everyone is excited and sings praises of the rapeseed of Xindu!

    What is it that attracts people's hearts so much? What makes people so intoxicated? A visitor answered in the guestbook: "Your rapeseed is a sea of flowers, a world of 'kings'! The secret of nature has been revealed, and the label of low yield for rapeseed has been removed. Your enthusiasm and wisdom have set a shining example for us to learn from!"

    The Land is Full of "Kings"
    These few short sentences express the reason for the common sentiment. Look! In the rapeseed fields, in the command fields, along the roads, by the rivers, in front of houses, and behind houses, everywhere are "Rapeseed Kings"; they are in patches, in rows, each tall and with many branches, each plant heroic and vigorous.

    Planting "Rapeseed Kings" in Xindu only started last year. This year, planting "Rapeseed Kings" has rapidly developed into a mass movement. From towns to villages, men, women, old and young, all participate, and the county has planted more than five million plants.

    The "Rapeseed Kings" of Guihu Commune are famous far and wide. The professional team led by Zhao Yuefen, a member of the Communist Youth League in Guihu Commune, manages over 230 "Rapeseed Kings." The spacing between the rapeseed plants is five chi (approximately 1.67 meters) in both directions. The soil underneath is built into raised beds, each bed is three chi (approximately 1 meter) square and half a chi (approximately 17 centimeters) high, with the rapeseed planted in the center. The fields are as clean as a mirror, with not a single weed to be found, and the soil shines with a dark oily luster. The more than 230 "Rapeseed Kings" in front of the First Canteen of this commune have now mostly grown to be more than one person tall, with a stem circumference of about two meters, and more than four hundred branches per plant, with some reaching one thousand six or seven hundred. Each branch is topped with numerous flower buds. The flowers on the first branches are in full bloom, each bright golden yellow, exquisite and translucent; the verdant green seed pods below are densely layered; the entire flowering branch is like a flower umbrella inlaid with jewels, standing gracefully. These "Kings" have already greatly exceeded the growth level of last year's "Kings" at the same stage. And now, there are still two months before the maturity period. As long as water and fertilizer are sufficient, the number of branches will increase, and more flowers will bloom.

    Learning from the "Kings" and Catching Up with the "Kings"

    However, this is not the whole world of "Kings." Due to the development of the movement to learn from and catch up with the "Kings," many large areas of rapeseed have also reached the growth level of the "Kings." In those golden, glittering large areas of rapeseed fields, they grow exceptionally well. Each plant is more than one person tall, in clumps and clusters, with branches and leaves connected, flowers and fruits overlapping, like myriad stars. Standing in this sea of "Kings," one feels as if they are in a celestial paradise, strongly feeling that in our era, the world is in our hands.

    The more than nine mu of rapeseed fields managed by the Liu Jiaqun team of Sanhe Commune were still a large area of third-class seedlings two months ago, because this area of rapeseed was sown half a month late. But now, what appears before our eyes is a completely different scene: the rapeseed in the fields has already rivaled the general "Rapeseed Kings" there. Liu Jiaqun and her partners are still not stopping. Carrying dung buckets, they run through the fields, shouting to the rapeseed: "Grow faster! Grow bigger!"

    When the county party committee issued a high standard field management campaign, calling on large areas of rapeseed to learn from and catch up with the "Kings," they immediately and without hesitation included this area of rapeseed in the "learn from the Kings, catch up with the Kings" plan. Some people worried for them, thinking that the conditions of this field were too poor, and it would be a waste of effort. But they replied: "With the Party, the People's Commune, and enthusiasm, these are the best conditions." They immediately ran to Guihu Commune to visit and learn the experience of managing the "Kings," and upon returning, they formulated a comprehensive combat program: Catch up with double the measures!

    These young people, described by the commune members as "little tigers," immediately changed the original seven-day interval for topdressing to three days, changed each ladle of manure watering four plants to watering two plants, separated out the seedlings with poor growth and gave them "special treatment," adding more water and fertilizer and giving special care; changed the originally planned one or two irrigations to frequent irrigation. For the past two months, they have guarded the fields day and night, just like mothers nurturing infants. Their shoulders are swollen from carrying, their clothes are worn out, but they are becoming more and more excited. Not long ago, aphids appeared in the fields, so they boiled pesticide solution overnight and went to the fields the next day. For several days in a row, they ate in the fields and slept nearby, turning over the rapeseed leaves one by one to spray the pesticide, finally quickly and thoroughly eliminating the pest.

    Also during this period, under the leadership of the commune party committee, all the commune members launched one after another mass movement to accumulate fertilizer, shoveling turf, emptying toilets, digging thousand-legged mud and old wall mud, and transporting large quantities of manure from dozens of miles away; when chemical fertilizer was insufficient, the entire commune launched a crash program to develop sideline occupations, using the income from collecting crushed stones for sale to purchase large quantities of ammonium sulfate; when the weather was dry and the water was shallow, the entire commune mobilized hundreds of commune members to dam all the rivers in two days, raising the water level. As they originally said, the commune is their source of strength for learning from and catching up with the "Kings," as well as the strength of other teams and groups.

    Good Leaders
    In front of each "Rapeseed King," each high-yield demonstration plot, and each command plot in Xindu, there are responsibility signs marked with the names of the responsible party leaders and cadres at all levels. They personally cultivate the "Kings," explore experience, and then lead the implementation in the command plots, driving the entire county's rapeseed fields to emulate the "Kings." They are the cultivators, supporters, and promoters of the "Kings." We have encountered Wang Haixiang, the first secretary of the county party committee, several times in front of the "Rapeseed Kings." This veteran cadre and female comrade from the north had never even seen rapeseed in her hometown, but now she has become the leader of the high-yield rapeseed movement in the county. Last year, she and other leading cadres of the county party committee jointly cultivated the "Rapeseed Kings" and summarized many important experiences such as applying sufficient base fertilizer, appropriately widening the plant spacing, rational close planting, and early sowing and early planting. This year, she personally planted two large "Rapeseed Kings," one of which has reached more than 1,600 branches and is nearly two meters high. People talk about how she led cadres and the masses to launch a crash program of inter-tillage in the heavy rain; how she and the commune members jointly researched the application of insulation fertilizer to the "Kings"; from the bottom of their hearts, they express their boundless love and respect.

    Because of this, the high-yield rapeseed movement is so widespread and in-depth in Xindu. Not only young people, women, and old farmers, but even 70- or 80-year-olds and elementary school children have also joined this upsurge. People challenge, compete, and the standards of field management are getting higher and higher, and the area of high-yield fields is getting larger and larger. Now, no ordinary rapeseed fields can be found in the county. Whether from the planning or the actual growth situation, all have become high-yield fields. And what is particularly noteworthy is that the area of rapeseed fields reaching the level of the "Kings" is still increasing. Several thousand mu have caught up with the level of last year's "Kings," and thousands of mu have caught up with the level of this year's "Kings" (general Kings). The rapeseed in the county is truly a scene of competing to be "Kings."

    花的海洋，“王”的世界
    本报记者　于竞祁
    3月春深，川西平原上正是草木竞长、群芳斗艳的季节。新都县的四万多亩油菜，经过一冬精心培植，已全部进入花期。从全省各县以至全国不少省份来参观的人群川流不息。在这里，人人为新都油菜而振奋，而歌唱！
    是什么这样地吸引了人们的心灵？是什么使人如此陶醉？一个参观者在留言簿上做了回答：“你们的油菜是鲜花的海洋，是‘王’的世界！大自然的秘密被揭开了，油菜低产帽子被摘掉了。你们的干劲和智慧，为我们树立了光辉的学习榜样！”
    大地皆“王”
    简短的几句话，道出了人心相共的缘由。看吧！油菜园里，指挥田中，路边、河旁、房前、屋后，到处都是“油菜王”；它们一片片、一排排，个个高大多枝，株株英姿雄发。
    种“油菜王”在新都还是从去年才开始的。今年种“油菜王”便迅速发展成为全民的运动，从城镇到乡村，男女老少齐动手，全县种了五百多万株。
    桂湖公社的“油菜王”是远近驰名的。桂湖公社共青团员赵跃芬领导的专业小组管理的那二百三十多株“油菜王”，油菜株与株间纵横株距都是五尺，下面培土为厢，每厢见方三尺，厢高半尺，中央种着油菜。田内光洁如镜，找不到一点杂草，土壤泛出黑油油的光彩。这个公社第一食堂前面二百三十多株“油菜王”，如今大都长到一人多高，株围直径两米左右，每株分枝四百个以上，多的已达一千六、七百个。每个分枝顶上都花蕾累累。第一分枝上的花都已盛开，朵朵鲜艳金黄，玲珑透剔；下部翠绿的菜荚密密层层；整个花枝像一把把镶满珠宝的花伞，亭亭玉立。这些“王”都已经大大超过去年“王”的同期生长的水平。而现在离成熟期还有两个月，只要水肥充足，分枝还会增多，花也还会多开。
    学“王”赶“王”
    然而这还不是“王”的世界全部。由于学“王”赶“王”运动的开展，许多大面积油菜也已达到“王”的生长水平。在那金光闪闪的大面积油菜田里，它们长得特别出众。每一株都是一人多高，一团团，一簇簇，枝叶相连，花果重叠，繁星万点。站在这种“王”海中，恍若置身天外仙境，使人强烈地感到，在我们的时代里，世界是在我们的手中。
    三河公社刘家群小组管的九亩多油菜田，两个月前还是一大片三类苗。因为这片油菜播种晚了半个月。但现在，出现在眼前的却是另外一番景象：田里的油菜已经和那里一般的“油菜王”媲美了。刘家群和她的伙伴们却还不罢手。挑着粪桶在田间飞跑，向油菜高喊着：“快点长吧！再往大长！”
    当县委发出开展高标准田间管理运动，号召大面积油菜学“王”赶“王”的时候，她们就毫不犹豫地把这片油菜列入学“王”、赶“王”计划。有人替她们担心，认为这片田条件太差，要白费劲。但她们回答说：“有党、有人民公社、有干劲，这就是最好的条件。”她们马上跑到桂湖公社去参观，学习了管“王”的经验，回来就制订了全盘战斗纲领：用加倍的措施赶上去！
    这些被社员们形容为“小老虎”的青年们，立刻把原来七天追肥一次改成了三天，把每瓢粪水浇四株改成浇两株，把生长太差的苗分出来开“小灶”，多加水肥，给特殊照顾；把原订浇灌一到两次水改成了勤浇勤灌。两个月来，她们就像母亲抚育婴儿一般，日夜守护在田间。肩膀挑肿了，衣服磨破了，人却愈干愈欢。不久前，田里发生了蚜虫，她们连夜熬药水，第二天就下田。她们一连几天，吃在田里，睡在附近，把油菜叶子一片一片地翻过来喷药，终于迅速而彻底地消灭了虫害。
    也就在这个期间，全社社员在公社党委领导下开展了一次又一次的全民突击积肥运动，铲草皮，掏厕所，挖千脚泥和老墙泥，到几十里外去运回大批粪便；化肥不够，全社又突击搞副业，用采集碎石出售的收入购回大批硫酸錏；天旱水浅，全社抽出几百个社员两天就闸堵了全部河道，提高了水位。正如她们原来所说的，公社是她们的、也是别的队、组的学“王”赶“王”的力量的泉源。
    好带路人
    在新都一株株“油菜王”、一片片丰产片和指挥片前，到处都插着标着负责管理的各级党的负责人和干部姓名的责任牌。他们亲手培植“王”，摸索经验，又领导在指挥片中贯彻推行，带动全县油菜田向“王”看齐。他们是“王”的培育者、支持者和提倡者。我们曾几次在“油菜王”前遇到县委第一书记王海香。这位来自北方的老干部和女同志，在家乡连油菜都没见过，但现在已成为全县油菜高产运动的带路人。去年，她就和县委其他领导干部共同培育了“油菜王”，总结了重施底肥、适当放宽株行距、合理密植、早播早栽等许多重要经验。今年，她又亲自种植了两株大“油菜王”，其中一株分枝已达一千六百多枝，高近二米。人们谈论着她如何冒着大雨领导干部、群众突击中耕；如何和社员一道研究出给“王”施保温肥；从心底流露出无比的敬爱。
    正因为如此，油菜高产运动在新都如此广泛和深入。不仅青年、妇女、老农，连七、八十岁的老人和上小学的儿童也都投入了这一热潮。人们挑战、竞赛，田间管理标准愈来愈高，高产田面积愈来愈大，如今全县已找不到油菜一般田。无论从规划上，从实际生长情况来看，全部都成了高产田。而特别引人注目的是达到“王”的水平的油菜田还在不断增加。有几千亩已赶上去年“王”的水平，上千亩赶上了今年“王”的水平（一般王），全县油菜真是一片竞相称“王”的景象。
