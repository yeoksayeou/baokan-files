Hebei Steel "Small Native Groups" Vigorously Innovate to Strive for Overproduction
Small Blast Furnaces Launch "Two-Five-Nine" Competition
Every Blast Furnace Strives for a Utilization Coefficient of Two or More, a Full-Staff Efficiency of Five Tons or More, a Pig Iron Qualification Rate of 90% or More, and a Coke Ratio Reduced to Below 0.9

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 17th dispatch) Nearly 100,000 "Small Native Group" iron smelting workers in Hebei Province are carrying out a "Two-Five-Nine" (small blast furnace average utilization coefficient reaching two or more, full-staff efficiency of five tons or more, pig iron qualification rate of 90% or more, and coke ratio reduced to below 0.9) red flag competition movement centered on the technical transformation of small blast furnaces. Starting from the beginning of March, in just ten days, the utilization coefficient of 46 small blast furnaces throughout the province has reached two or more, and the average utilization coefficient of more than 100 small blast furnaces has reached 1.2 or more.

The "Two-Five-Nine" red flag competition movement is a new development in the high tide of iron smelting production. After two months of mass movements for technical innovation and technical revolution, fundamental changes have taken place in the steel "Small Native Groups". By the end of February, the vast majority of small blast furnaces in the province had undergone a second technical transformation. Benchmark furnaces with utilization coefficients of three, four, five, and above ten appeared repeatedly. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of production processes such as ore crushing, in-plant transportation, and mining increased from 33.3% last year to 51.1%. 28,000 workers have put down hand hammers, carrying poles, and hand drills, and are using simplified drilling machines, ore crushers, and track vehicles and other mechanized and semi-mechanized tools. Labor productivity has more than doubled. Nearly two hundred simple coking furnaces throughout the province have been put into production, and the operating skills of coking workers have also improved significantly. All this shows that the steel "Small Native Groups" in Hebei Province have entered a new stage. The "Two-Five-Nine" red flag competition movement was proposed on this basis.

After the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward this competition goal, it was immediately enthusiastically responded to by the vast number of iron smelting workers. A mass high-yield competition between factories, furnaces, and shifts quickly unfolded throughout the province. The workers of the iron smelting plants in the Baoding area adopted the method of finding weak links in each furnace and formulating innovation plans for each link, and formulated guarantee measures to achieve "Two-Five-Nine." In early March, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the nine iron smelting plants in the whole area reached 1.3, and the pig iron qualification rate was above 80%. On March 11, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in six factories in the whole area reached 3.14, the coke ratio was 0.88, the qualification rate was 94%, and the full-staff efficiency reached 6.15 tons, reaching the "Two-Five-Nine" standard. According to the weak links of its own plant, the Jiajiaying Iron Smelting Plant in Zhangjiakou Prefecture promoted seven advanced experiences such as multiple fans, parallel hot blast stoves, increasing air supply pipes, and increasing air inlets to achieve large-scale high-temperature operation. From March 1 to 7, the seven small blast furnaces in the plant overfulfilled the production plan every day. The average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces reached 1.8, the production qualification rate reached 91.4%, and the coke ratio dropped to 0.94.

Comprehensively grasping the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, making the equipment before and after the furnace and to the left and right of the furnace complete, and the transportation networked, is an important link in realizing the "Two-Five-Nine" competition. To this end, each factory universally carried out small blast furnace ranking, identified weak links, and adopted the method of assigning personnel, setting time, concentrating efforts, and carrying out phased assaults to carry out technical transformation and equipment matching. After the preliminary transformation of the iron smelting plants in Handan Prefecture in the winter and early this year, the utilization coefficient of 124 small blast furnaces in the whole area increased to above one. However, links such as ore crushing, powder ore sintering, and in-plant transportation could not keep up. In this competition, in order to break through this weak link, the party committee secretaries of each plant and mine personally took command, mobilized workers, and vigorously attacked the mechanization and semi-mechanization of ore crushing, sintering, and in-plant transportation, and carried out equipment matching. At present, 90% of the ore crushing and screening of medium and small blast furnaces in the whole area have realized mechanization and semi-mechanization. In-plant transportation has realized the rail and vehicle system, increasing labor productivity by one to two times. The ore particle size is uniform, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces has increased to 1.5, and the quality of pig iron has also improved significantly.

In the red flag competition, in order to achieve "Two-Five-Nine" for each furnace and a full house in the first quarter for each factory, many local party committee secretaries, metallurgical bureau directors, factory directors, and other leading cadres went deep into the front line, working and directing production at the same time. At the same time, adopting the leadership method of breaking through one point and driving the overall situation, vigorously grasping benchmark furnaces and benchmark factories, promoted the overall leap forward in pig iron production.

    河北钢铁小洋群大闹革新力争超产
    小高炉掀起“二五九”竞赛
    座座高炉争取利用系数达到二以上，全员效率五吨以上生铁合格率百分之九十以上，焦比降到零点九以下
    本报天津17日电　河北省近十万名“小洋群”炼铁职工，正在开展一个以小高炉技术改造为中心的“二、五、九”（小高炉平均利用系数达到二以上、全员效率五吨以上、生铁合格率90％以上、焦比降到零点九以下）红旗竞赛运动。从3月初开始，仅十天时间，全省已有四十六座小高炉的利用系数达到了二以上，有一百多座小高炉平均利用系数达到一点二以上。
    “二、五、九”红旗竞赛运动，是炼铁生产高潮的新发展。经过两个月来的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，钢铁“小洋群”已经发生了根本的变化。到2月底，全省绝大部分的小高炉进行了第二次技术改造，利用系数一度在三、四、五和十以上的标兵炉，一再出现；矿石破碎、厂内运输和采矿等生产工序机械化半机械化程度，由去年的33．3％提高到51．1％；有两万八千名工人放下了手锤、扁担和手钎，使用上简易打眼机、矿石破碎机和轨道车等机械化半机械化机具；劳动生产率提高了一倍多。全省已有近二百座简易炼焦炉投入了生产，炼焦工人的操作水平也有了显著提高。这一切表明，河北省钢铁小洋群，已经进入了一个新的阶段。“二、五、九”红旗竞赛运动，就是在这个基础上提出来的。
    当中共河北省委提出这一竞赛目标以后，立即受到了广大炼铁职工的热烈响应。一个群众性的厂与厂、炉与炉、班与班之间的大面积高产竞赛很快就在全省开展起来了。保定地区各炼铁厂职工采取炉炉找薄弱环节，环环制订革新计划的办法，订出了实现“二、五、九”的保证措施；全区九个炼铁厂，3月上旬，小高炉平均利用系数达到了一点三，生铁合格率都在80％以上。3月11日，全区有六个厂的小高炉，利用系数达到三点一四，焦比为零点八八，合格率为94％，全员效率达到六点一五吨，达到了“二、五、九”的标准。张家口专区贾家营炼铁厂根据本厂的薄弱环节，推行了多风机、多热风炉并联、加大送风管、增加进风口等七项先进经验，实现了大风高温操作，从3月1日到7日，全厂七座小高炉日日超额完成生产计划，小高炉平均利用系数达到了一点八，生产合格率达到了91．4％，焦比降到零点九四。
    大抓小高炉的全面技术改造，使小高炉炉前炉后，炉左炉右设备成套，运输成网，是实现“二、五、九”竞赛的重要环节。为此，各厂普遍地进行了小高炉排队，找出薄弱环节，采取定人、定时、集中力量，分期突击的办法，进行技术改造和设备配套。邯郸专区各炼铁厂经过去冬和今年年初的初步改造，全区有一百二十四座小高炉利用系数提高到一以上。但是矿石破碎、粉矿烧结、厂内运输等环节跟不上。在这次竞赛中，为突破这个薄弱环节，各厂矿党委书记亲自挂帅，发动工人，猛攻矿石破碎、烧结、厂内运输机械化半机械化，进行设备配套。目前，全区中小型高炉已有90％的矿石破碎、筛分实现了机械化半机械化；厂内运输实现了轨道、车子化，提高劳动生产率一倍到两倍；矿石粒度均匀，小高炉平均利用系数提高到一点五，生铁质量也有显著提高。
    在红旗竞赛中，为了作到炉炉实现“二、五、九”，厂厂作到首季满堂红，许多地区党委书记、冶金局长、厂长等领导干部深入第一线，边劳动、边指挥生产。同时，采取突破一点带动全面的领导方法，大抓标兵炉和标兵厂，促进了生铁生产全面跃进。
