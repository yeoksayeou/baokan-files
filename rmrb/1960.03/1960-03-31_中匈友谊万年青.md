Sino-Hungarian Friendship is Evergreen
By our reporter Zhu Yuemei

On the eve of the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation, I came to Yanzhou and visited the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine Tractor Station. Deputy Station Director Liang Wenhua enthusiastically introduced the station's situation to me.

In the winter of 1955, during the high tide of China's agricultural cooperativization, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the government sent a batch of the most precious gifts—a complete set of equipment for a tractor station. At the same time, five Hungarian experts, Vatayrna, Viles, Banhasi, Bidi, and others, also came to Yanzhou. During their year and a half in China, the experts demonstrated a lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism and the Hungarian people's brotherly friendship towards the Chinese people. In those days, the Hungarian experts successively held two training classes for machine operators and one training class for management cadres, passing on their knowledge and experience to their Chinese brothers without reservation. In the fields of Qufu, Zou County, and Jining, Jixiang and Jinxiang near Weishan Lake, the experts' sweat was shed, and their footprints left. Regardless of the hot summer and severe winter, day and night, they often worked tirelessly, forgetting to eat and sleep.

It was during the wheat harvest of 1956 when it was drizzling. The harvester harvesting wheat at Jiuguan broke down. It was already 11 o'clock at night. The driver told the station about the situation. The station's technician, Mi Shouqi, was in a fix: Should he call the experts? They had gone to Wangyin, thirty miles away, during the day to inspect and guide work, and didn't return until 9 pm; if he didn't call, the experts had instructed: "Anytime, anywhere, if there is a machine failure, you must report it immediately." In the end, he called. Expert Bidi, who had just fallen asleep, rushed to the scene without even putting on his coat. Look at him, sometimes under the machine body, sometimes lying on the ground looking up at the sky, rainwater and sweat mixed together, his whole body covered with wheat chaff and mud. After two hours of emergency repairs, the machine returned to normal. Mi Shouqi looked at his watch, it was already three o'clock in the morning. He urged the expert to return to the station to rest, but the expert waved his hand and held up one finger, saying: Wait another hour and see. Only after an hour, when the harvester was repaired, he said: "Completely good!" and then returned to the station. At that time, the east was already reddish.

Four years is just a brief moment in history. During this period, the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine Tractor Station, under the illumination of the general line and under the care of the Hungarian Embassy in China, has developed into an agricultural mechanization center in the Lunan area. The number of tractors owned by the station has increased from thirteen in 1957 to thirty. In 1958, all thirteen GS-35 tractors achieved more than 10,000 mu of work. The agricultural mechanization school attached to the station, which was built that year, will be expanded this year into a secondary specialized school accommodating 2,000 students, specializing in training intermediate agricultural machinery technical personnel. Li Baolin, the director of the repair workshop in 1957, is now the director of the repair and assembly plant. He told me enthusiastically: We have not disappointed the experts' expectations. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 liberated our minds. We have developed from a repair workshop with fifteen workers into a repair and assembly plant with more than 180 workers, repairing 400 standard units per year and able to manufacture more than 50 kinds of accessories. To support agricultural mechanization, we are now trial-producing 20-horsepower diesel engines. He said that the output value plan completed in January and February alone was 388% of the first quarter of last year.

The Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine Tractor Station is a fertile field for cultivating the flowers of Sino-Hungarian friendship. In the past four years, it has trained and delivered more than 700 technical personnel and management cadres to China's agricultural front. What is particularly exciting and gratifying is that most of the agricultural technicians personally trained by Hungarian experts are now technicians, captains, and drivers. Chi Xiuting is one of them.

Chi Xiuting was transferred from the army in 1954 and came to Yanzhou to build the station with Hungarian experts. Under the personal help and guidance of experts such as Banhasi and Bidi, after a year and a half, he learned various agricultural machinery operations and became an excellent driver, a tillage team leader, and is now the director of the metalworking workshop of the repair and assembly plant.

In the summer of 1956, when Chi Xiuting was driving the bundler sent by the Hungarian people to work on the farm for the first time, he accidentally damaged the swing gear bearing. He told expert Bidi. In that wheat-ripening weather, the earth was scorching hot. However, expert Bidi lay under the bundler and worked for several hours, his whole body covered in mud and sweat pouring down like rain. Chi Xiuting couldn't bear it any longer, and said, "Comrade Bidi, take a break!" The expert, while rushing to repair the machine, said in a stern tone: "The wheat harvest is more important!"

When Chi Xiuting recalled these old events, he said to the reporter with infinite gratitude: "Sino-Hungarian friendship has taken root in my heart."

These days, people from all walks of life in Qufu County are busy preparing for activities to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. When I came to the Balipu Production Brigade (formerly the Friendship Agricultural Cooperative) of Yanzhou Commune, Deputy Brigade Leader Chen Yongshu (formerly the director of the Friendship Cooperative) said: "Every festive season makes me miss my relatives even more. The 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation is coming soon, to be honest, how I miss the experts! Several years have passed, but every event that happened when the experts were here is like yesterday." He said meaningfully: "After the establishment of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Tractor Station, our advanced agricultural cooperative of more than 500 households was born. It's strange to say, the old middle peasant Xu Wenxiang bought thirteen mu of land from others and hadn't finished paying for it. When he saw the tractors and chaff cutters working here, he went to the branch secretary Zhou Qinghe and said: 'Old Zhou, this thing is useful, I have to join the cooperative too.' After the cooperative was established, more than 2,000 members unanimously agreed to name the cooperative 'Friendship Agricultural Cooperative' to commemorate the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people. With the help of the tractor station and the experts, we had a bumper harvest in the first year. The average yield of wheat per mu was 170 jin, 50 jin more per mu than in 1955. That year, the wheat harvest coincided with continuous rainy days. The threshing machines at the station were threshing grain here day and night, and the experts came almost every day to ensure our high yield and bumper harvest." Chen Yongshu was completely immersed in happy memories. He said: "The experts cared too much about our Balipu. On April 4, 1956, when I went to the station to participate in the celebration of Hungary's Liberation Day, expert Viles said to me first in Chinese: 'Balipu!' and hugged me tightly. When I think back, I still feel warm."

In March this year, the workers of the repair and assembly plant put forward the slogan "We will dedicate new achievements to the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation." A heated competition unfolded between the workshops of the repair and assembly plant. As soon as the big-character poster guaranteeing the completion of the first quarter's plan five days ahead of schedule to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation was posted by the metalworking workshop, the repair workshop immediately responded to the challenge with the condition of completing the first quarter's plan six days ahead of schedule as a gift. The drivers of the three tractor teams who were compacting the dam on the Nishan Reservoir construction site in Qufu County were even more enthusiastic. There is a twenty-two-year-old girl named Zhang Lanqin. In 1956, she resigned from her position as the deputy director of the former Yanzhou Xiguan Advanced Agricultural Cooperative and became the first batch of farm tool operators on the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Tractor. Inspired by the internationalist spirit of the Hungarian people and experts, she studied the technology of using agricultural machinery with the greatest enthusiasm. For three years, she has been a maintainer of high efficiency, good quality, fuel saving, and safe production, and has been rated as an advanced producer every time. Now she is the deputy captain of the tillage team. On March 16, she said at the drivers' meeting: "Comrades, April 4 is the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. I propose that we complete 40 shifts of work in 19 days, accelerate water conservancy construction, and dedicate it to the festival. What do you think?"

"Fully agree!" Fifty-six drivers shouted in unison. The construction site immediately boiled. Countless big-character posters were posted: "Strictly abide by the machine operation regulations and maintenance system," "Ensure safe production," "Ensure low compaction quality," "Ensure early completion of tasks"... They really meant what they said. Twelve tractors, dragging stone rollers weighing more than 10,000 jin, galloped on the embankment day and night, completely replacing the heavy manual labor of ramming. According to the Water Conservancy Headquarters, one minute of work for each tractor is equivalent to one day's work for a laborer.

The nine drivers who were repairing farm tools at the tractor station were even more unwilling to lag behind. Everyone proposed to complete the farm tool repair tasks ten days ahead of schedule on April 4 to welcome the summer harvest and planting as a gift to the Hungarian people on their great festival!

    中匈友谊万年青
    本报记者　朱曰梅
    匈牙利解放十五周年前夕，我来到兗州，访问了中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站。副站长梁文华热情地向我介绍了这个站的情况。
    1955年冬季，正当我国农业合作化高潮时，匈牙利社会主义工人党和政府送来了一批最珍贵的礼品——一个拖拉机站的全套设备。同时，瓦岱尔纳、维莱斯、班哈西、比迪等五位匈牙利专家也来到了兗州。专家在中国一年半的时间内，表现了崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神和匈牙利人民对中国人民的兄弟般的友谊。在那些日子里，匈牙利专家先后举办了两次机务人员训练班和一次管理干部训练班，把他们的知识和经验，毫无保留地传给了中国弟兄。在曲阜、邹县，以及微山湖附近的嘉祥、金乡等县的土地上，都洒下了专家的汗水，留下了专家的脚印。他们不顾炎夏和隆冬，不分白天和晚上，常常废寝忘食，通宵达旦地工作。
    那是1956年麦收的事，这天正下着毛毛雨，去旧关麦收的收割机发生了故障。这时已经晚上十一点钟了。驾驶员把情况告诉了站部。站部的技术员米寿祺可难坏了：叫专家吧，他们白天去三十里外的王因检查指导工作，晚上九点才回来；不叫吧，专家又有嘱咐：“任何时候，任何地方，机器发生毛病都要马上告诉。”最后，他还是叫了。刚刚入睡的比迪专家一听，连外衣也没穿就奔向现场。你看他，一会儿在机身底下，一会儿又躺在地上仰面朝天，雨水、汗水汇在一起，全身粘满了麦糠和泥土。经过两个小时的抢修，机器恢复了正常。米寿祺看了看表已经深夜三点了，他催着专家回站休息，但专家把手一摆，伸出一个指头说：再等一个小时看看。直到一小时后，把收割机修好了，他说：“完全良好！”然后方才回站。那时，东方已泛起绛红色。
    四年在历史上只是短暂的一瞬间，就在这个期间，中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站在总路线的照耀下，在匈牙利驻华大使馆的关怀下，已发展成为鲁南地区的农业机械化中心。这个站拥有的拖拉机已由1957年的十三台增加到三十台，1958年十三台GS—35拖拉机全部达到万亩以上工作量，这年建成的站附设的农业机械化学校，今年要扩建成容纳二千名学生的中等专业学校，专门培养中等农业机械技术人材。1957年的修理车间主任李宝林，现在已是修配厂的厂长了。他兴致勃勃地告诉我：我们没有辜负专家的期望，1958年的大跃进解放了我们的思想，我们这里已从由十五个工人的修理车间，发展成为一百八十多个工人、年修四百修理标准台并能制造五十多种配件的修配厂。为支援农业机械化，现在正在试制二十马力柴油机。他说，仅1、2月份完成的产值计划就为去年第一季度的388％。
    中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站，是一块培育中匈友谊之花的良田。四年多来，它先后为我国农业战线培养和输送了七百多名技术人员和管理干部。令人特别兴奋和欣慰的是，匈牙利专家亲自培养的那批农业技术人员，现在大部分都成了技术员、队长和车长，迟秀亭就是其中的一个。
    迟秀亭1954年从部队转业后，来到兗州和匈牙利专家们一起建站。在班哈西、比迪等专家的亲手帮助和培养下，经过一年半的时间，他学会了农业机械各种作业，成了优秀的驾驶员，当了机耕队长，现在是修配厂金工车间的主任了。
    1956年夏季，当迟秀亭第一次驾驶着匈牙利人民送给的割捆机在农场工作时，因为不慎，摇背齿轮轴承坏了。他告诉了比迪专家。在那麦熟的天气，大地被晒得滚烫。可是比迪专家伏在割捆机底下一连工作了好几个小时，全身是泥，汗流如雨。迟秀亭再也忍不住了，他说：“比迪同志，休息一会吧！”专家一面赶修机器，一面用严厉的口吻说：“还是麦收重要！”
    迟秀亭回忆起这些旧事时，怀着无限感激的心情对记者说：“中匈友谊已在我心里扎下了根子。”
    这些日子，曲阜县各界人民正在忙着筹备庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年的活动。当我来到兗州公社八里铺生产大队时（原友谊农业社），大队副队长陈永书（原友谊社社长）说：“每逢佳节倍思亲。匈牙利解放十五周年快来了，说实话，我是多么想念专家们啊！事情已经过去几年了，但专家在这里时的每一件事都同昨天一样。”他意味深长地说：“中匈友谊拖拉机站建立后，我们五百多户的高级农业社就诞生了。说也怪，老中农徐文祥买了别人十三亩地还没交完钱，一看在我们这里工作的拖拉机、铡草机，就找着支部书记周庆和说：‘老周，这玩艺儿可管用，我也得入社啦’。社诞生后，二千多名社员为了纪念中匈人民的友谊，一致同意把社名定为‘友谊农业社’。我们在拖拉机站和专家的帮助下，头一年就获得了大丰收。每亩小麦平均产量一百七十斤，比1955年每亩多收五十斤。那年麦收正碰着连阴天，站上的脱谷机日夜地在这里脱谷，专家们几乎每天都来，保证了我们丰产丰收。”陈永书完全沉入了幸福的回忆中。他说：“专家对我们八里铺太关怀了，1956年4月4日我到站上参加庆祝匈牙利解放日时，专家维莱斯用中国话首先对我说：‘八里铺的！’并紧紧拥抱我，我回想起来，现在还觉着热呼呼的。”
    今年3月间，修配厂的工人提出了“我们要以新的成绩，向匈牙利解放十五周年献礼”的口号。修配厂车间与车间展开了热烈的竞赛。金工车间保证提前五天完成第一季度计划向匈牙利解放十五周年献礼的大字报刚刚贴出，修理车间马上以提前六天完成第一季度计划为献礼条件向金工车间应了战。正在曲阜县尼山水库工地上压堤的三个机耕队的驾驶员，更是干劲冲天。这里有个年方二十二岁的姑娘张兰琴，1956年她辞去了原兗州西关高级农业社副社长的职务，当了中匈友谊拖拉机上的第一批农具手。她在匈牙利人民和专家的国际主义精神的鼓舞下，以最大的热情钻研使用农业机械的技术，三年来她一直是效率高、质量好、节约油料、安全生产的保持者，每次都被评为先进生产者，现在已是机耕队的副队长了。3月16日这天，她在驾驶员会议上说：“同志们，4月4日是匈牙利解放十五周年的节日，我提议，我们用十九天完成四十个班次的工作量，加速水利建设，向节日献礼，你们看怎样？”
    “完全同意！”五十六个驾驶员一齐振臂高呼。工地上立刻沸腾起来了。无数的大字报贴出来了：“严格遵守机车操作规程和保养制度”，“保证安全生产”，“保证压低质量”，“保证提前完成任务”……真是说到做到。十二台拖拉机拖着万斤多重的大石碾，夜以继日地奔驰在大堤上，全部代替了人们的笨重的体力劳动——打夯。据水利指挥部计算，每台拖拉机工作一分钟，就等于一个劳动力一天的工效。
    在拖拉机站检修农具的九名驾驶员，更不甘落后，大家提出，提前十天在4月4日完成农具检修任务，迎接夏收夏种，作为对匈牙利人民伟大节日的献礼！（附图片）
