West Germany on the Road to Atomic Armament
Li Yue
　　
Under the aegis of the United States, West German militarists are frantically rushing down the road to preparing for atomic war. Bonn has become a dangerous breeding ground for new wars in Europe.
　　
Although Adenauer, Strauss and other ringleaders of the Bonn ruling clique have repeatedly argued that they do not want to hinder the easing of the international situation, and even portray themselves as supporters of disarmament, their actions have ruthlessly exposed their lies.
　　
Large-scale Expansion of Army, Navy and Air Force
　　
Facts are the most eloquent testimony. According to statistics, as of early February this year, the strength of the West German Federal "Defense Forces" totaled 250,000, already accounting for three-quarters of its projected total strength of 350,000 to be completed in 1961. The West German army now has seven divisions, with 154,500 men, making it the largest ground force in Western Europe. Four of these seven divisions were built last year. On March 12, General Norstad, the Supreme Commander of the European Forces of the North Atlantic Group, praised West Germany in Washington for completing its "quota" last year and making "the greatest progress" in military construction and training. The West German Navy has now built 16 flotillas, with a force of 22,000 men. The Air Force has built 12 squadrons, with a force of 60,000 men. In addition, there are 13,500 men in the so-called "local defense force."
　　
The Bonn Ministry of Defense announced in early February this year that the construction of the West German "Defense Forces" has entered its "final stage" this year. In the next two years, the army will complete the planned 12 divisions and 200,000 men. The Navy and Air Force will complete the planned 22 flotillas (25,000 men) and 28 squadrons (100,000 men) in 1963, respectively. The so-called "local defense force" will also reach 25,000 men in 1963.
　　
The West German army is almost entirely composed of former Hitler "Defense Forces" officers with rich "experience" in fascist warfare, who serve as middle and senior commanders. Now these past executioners are taking up weapons of mass destruction with the help of the United States, preparing for an atomic war. In order to make the troops flexible and mobile to meet the requirements of modern atomic warfare, the army completed the reorganization of the existing troops into brigades as basic units at the end of last year. As many as 4,000 army, navy and air force officers and soldiers have been trained in the United States to become the backbone force in the use of atomic weapons. The Bonn Ministry of Defense also plans to specifically strengthen the "combat capability" of the training troops this year.
　　
Atomic Armament is Accelerated
　　
In the past year, the work of atomic armament has been accelerated. Last year, West Germany began to establish two "Honest John" missile battalions and one "Nike" missile battalion, and tested the launching of "Honest John" missiles; in addition, it purchased "Matador" atomic missiles. In December last year, the Defense Committee of the West German Parliament approved the Ministry of Defense's purchase of 150 of the latest US "Mars" atomic bombs with a range of 1,200 kilometers. In January this year, the West German Defense Committee decided to purchase the US "Sergeant" missiles and planned to equip three battalions with this type of missile. According to the Bonn Ministry of Defense, by the end of this year, at least four "Nike" missile battalions will be built, each with four batteries and forty-eight launchers. Before long, the number of such missile battalions will increase to six. At the same time, the West German Navy and Air Force are also being equipped with new torpedoes, atomic missiles and atomic bomb bombers. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said not long ago: "As a result of close cooperation with the United States, West Germany has become a nuclear-equipped country." From a practical point of view, this assertion is not at all excessive. West Germany not only equips its troops with American atomic weapons, but is also actively preparing to produce its own atomic weapons with the support of the United States. Last summer, the United States signed an "atomic agreement" with West Germany, stipulating that the two countries exchange "nuclear military intelligence." In October last year, the Western European Union, under pressure from the United States, approved West Germany's production of "Hawk" missiles and "Sidewinder" missiles, which is actually the first step in canceling the provisions of the "Paris Agreement" that prohibit West Germany from producing atomic weapons. Recently, West Germany has officially signed agreements with France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands to jointly produce "Hawk" missiles. According to West German sources, West Germany has the industrial base and technical conditions for the production of atomic weapons. A document published by the Bonn government in January this year shows that there are currently 260 companies in West Germany producing various atomic energy equipment and related devices, including radioactive devices and nuclear fuel. It is revealed that West Germany has explored five uranium mines, and the first uranium mine began production in October last year. In addition, Farbwerke Hoechst, a chemical industry group, is building a new factory for the production of heavy water (nuclear fuel). After it is put into production, West Germany's annual production of heavy water will reach about 150 tons, equivalent to 83% of the current annual production in the United States.
　　
For a long time, West Germany has been using a decentralized form to carry out atomic research work in many large concerns and scientific research institutions. For example, the "Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science Research" in Gottingen has many research institutes related to atomic science. Some large concerns in the electrical, chemical, and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, such as Farbwerke Hoechst, AEG, and Alfred Petersen Metallurgical Company, have their own atomic research institutions. According to a decision by the Bonn government, some heads of large concerns and financial giants (including Abs, chairman of Deutsche Bank) jointly formed an "Atomic Commission" in 1955, known as the "Atomic Pantheon," as an "advisory body" to the Bonn Atomic Energy Department. In the summer of 1959, these monopoly giants formed an "Atomic Association" to further unite the relevant units and uniformly adjust atomic research work. In December last year, the West German Parliament approved a "Atomic Law" of the Bonn government, which aims to prepare for the production of atomic weapons under the guise of "peaceful use of atomic energy."
　　
The Bonn Ministry of Defense itself is also using a lot of money to develop new weapons, including atomic weapons. According to the Munich "Deutsche Wochenzeitung," the total cost of atomic armament in West Germany for the fiscal year ending April 1, 1961 will reach 57 billion marks. As for West Germany's participation in the work of the Saint-Louis Atomic Research Institute in France and France's atomic bomb tests in the Sahara with a lot of money and scientific personnel, it is already an open secret.
　　
Missile Bases are Everywhere
　　
As a "shield" in the North Atlantic Group's atomic war plan, West German territory is covered with missile bases. The largest and most numerous missile bases belong to the United States. It is estimated that West Germany has spent at least billions of marks on US missile bases. The largest missile base of the US military in Europe is located in Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate. Some small towns next to this city have been expanded into American-style modern cities, filled with American military personnel. Next to the main road near Pomhut, there are US military missile force garrisons and arsenals stretching for several kilometers, all of which are closely guarded by the US military. A car was warned by the US military with gunfire on this section of the highway because it was driving a little slower. Next to the main road near Darmstadt in Hesse, the US military hides missile installations behind a row of small trees. But when preparing for exercises, the missile launchers are erected and can be seen from a distance. In Bavaria, Grafenwoehr and Foelsden, adjacent to the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, are also important military bases of the US military in Europe, equipped with missile installations.
　　
Military Exercises are Unscrupulous
　　
The West German "Defense Forces" are also increasing their own missile bases. In North Rhine-Westphalia, a semi-circular missile zone centered on the Ruhr heavy industrial area is being established. Missile launch pads are also located in the forest area northeast of Bonn. According to reports from the Social Democratic Party's news agency, Schleswig-Holstein, where the West German Navy and Air Force bases are concentrated, will become the number one missile fortress of the North Atlantic Group. At least eight missile launch pads will be set up on the Baltic coast of this state. It is said that the air force exercise field in this state already accounts for almost one-eighth of the state's land area. Residents of many cities live in the roar of aircraft all day long. On the highway from Hamburg to Bremen, cars often have accidents due to low-flying aircraft. Local residents have continued to protest due to the harassment and damage.
　　
The West German army and the US military stationed in West Germany also frequently hold provocative military exercises. In the past year, at least six large-scale exercises have been held. The attack directions of these exercises are aimed at the German Democratic Republic from the north, west, and southwest. At the end of January and the beginning of February this year, the unprecedented large-scale "Winter Shield" exercise jointly conducted by the US Seventh Army and the West German army was held in an area of about 6,000 square kilometers adjacent to the borders of the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia. A total of 60,000 officers and soldiers participated in this exercise, and the content of the exercise was the so-called "first phase of the offensive." Atomic weapons were also used in the exercise, and more than 200 officers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization visited the launch of "Honest John" missiles on the spot. It is revealed that in this large-scale exercise, many soldiers and West German civilians were killed and injured, and property losses amounted to 9 million marks. Bonn's war preparations have increasingly and widely affected the daily lives of West German residents. According to a recent announcement by the Ministry of the Interior, while planning to build a national "air defense alarm system" by the end of 1961, air-raid shelters must also be set up in all newly built houses. In order to drive the people to serve the military authorities' war preparations, the Bonn government passed an "Emergency Service Law" in February this year, stipulating that even in peacetime, residents have the "obligation" to engage in "emergency service."
　　
War Mongering is Increasingly Rampant
　　
The Bonn government inherited Hitler's mantle in its war preparations: on the one hand, it stepped up military construction, and on the other hand, it used psychological warfare to drive the people to endure sacrifices for their war preparations. In this situation, West German war propaganda is also becoming more and more rampant. Schramm, an American war agitator who appeared in West Germany as a journalist, has given more than 20 speeches in major cities in West Germany since last summer, and has also published long articles in the "Stern" pictorial in succession, openly clamoring for atomic war. He put forward such a logic: if he accurately knew that the Soviet Union was going to "launch an offensive" on a certain day, then he would use "all means" to start a "preemptive war" a few days before, but because he did not know when the Soviet Union would launch an offensive, he should simply launch a war of aggression. This war agitator himself admitted that he was a "friend" with more than 30 members of the Christian Democratic Union (Adenauer Party) and knew many ministers of the Bonn government. His speeches everywhere were hosted by militarist groups such as the "Association for Saving Freedom" and the "Research Society for National Political Public Opinion Work," which were chaired by important figures of the Adenauer Party. Peter Kleist, a diplomatic official and old Nazi of the Hitler fascist era, wrote a book last year entitled "Khrushchev - Fifty Kilometers Before Hamburg," advocating strengthening the arms race, carrying out an anti-Soviet war, and shouting that "war cannot be postponed." There are many similar books, some even openly saying that they want to "liberate" the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and "fight all the way to the Urals." Many generals of the Hitler "Defense Forces" use the form of memoirs to distort historical facts and promote Hitler's "brilliance" and "bravery." In addition, according to statistics, 15 to 20 million copies of war pamphlets and brochures that promote fascist war and encourage young people to "not think," just "fight tenaciously" and "fight bravely and kill the enemy" were published in West Germany last year alone.
　　
People only need to think about how Adenauer, Strauss and others are clamoring for anti-Soviet, anti-communist and "liberating" the German Democratic Republic and other clichés, and they will not be surprised at all by the proliferation of West German war propaganda.
　　
However, the German people, who have been poisoned by two wars, will not be as easily deceived by militarists as they were in the past. Bonn's atomic war preparations have aroused increasingly strong opposition from the people. Although the Bonn government has stepped up its suppression and persecution of the people's anti-atomic armament movement in the past year or so, the West German people's struggle against Bonn's atomic war preparation policy has become more and more extensive and in-depth. At the same time, the broad public in Western Europe is also deeply disturbed by the US support for West Germany's atomic war preparations. Under the instigation of the United States, the Bonn ruling clique is following the old path of Hitler's launching of a war of aggression. However, the voices of the people of the world demanding to stop the evil activities of the US and West German war forces are rising and will continue to rise.

    西德在原子备战的道路上
    李越
    波恩军国主义者在美国扶植下，正在准备原子战争的道路上疯狂地奔跑。波恩已经成为新战争在欧洲的危险策源地。
    尽管阿登纳、施特劳斯等波恩统治集团头目再三辩解说，他们并不想阻挠国际局势的缓和，甚至把自己说成是裁军的拥护者，然而他们的行动却无情地揭穿了他们的谎言。
    海陆空军兵力大扩充
    事实是最雄辩的见证人。据统计，到今年2月上旬为止，西德联邦“国防军”的兵力共有二十五万人，已经达到它预计在1961年建成的全部兵力三十五万人的四分之三。西德的陆军现有七个师，十五万四千五百人，已经成为西欧大陆上一支人数最多的地面部队。这七个师里有四个师是在去年建成的。北大西洋集团欧洲军最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德3月12日在华盛顿夸奖西德去年完成了“定额”，在建军和训练上取得了“最大的进步”。西德的海军现在已经建成十六个分舰队，拥有兵力两万二千人。空军已建成十二个中队，兵力六万人。另外还有所谓“地方防御军”一万三千五百人。
    波恩国防部在今年2月初宣布西德“国防军”的建设今年进入了它的“最后阶段”。今明两年，陆军就将完成十二个师，二十万人的预定计划。海、空军将在1963年分别完成二十二个分舰队（两万五千人）和二十八个中队（十万人）的预定计划。所谓“地方防御军”也将在1963年达到两万五千人。
    西德的军队，几乎完全由富有法西斯战争“经验”的前希特勒“国防军”军官充任中、上级指挥官，现在这些过去的刽子手正在美国帮助下，拿起了大规模杀人武器，准备着一场原子战争。为了使部队灵活、机动以适应现代原子战争的要求，陆军在去年年底就完成了把现有部队改编成以旅为基本单位的工作。在美国受训成为使用原子武器的骨干力量的陆海空军官兵已达四千人。波恩国防部还计划在今年特别加强训练部队的“作战能力”。
    原子武装加速进行
    最近一年来，原子武装的工作正在加速进行。去年西德开始建立了两个“诚实的约翰”式导弹营和一个“奈克”式导弹营，并且试验放射了“诚实的约翰”式导弹；另外还购买了“斗牛士”式原子导弹。去年12月，西德议会国防委员会批准国防部购买美国最新式的射程达一千二百公里的“马斯”式原子弹一百五十个。今年1月份西德国防委员会又决定购买美国的“中士”式导弹，并计划用这种导弹装备三个营。据波恩国防部宣布，到今年底，将至少建成四个“奈克”式导弹营，每个营拥有四个炮队和四十八个发射台。再过不久，这种导弹营将增加到六个。与此同时，西德的海、空军也在用新式鱼雷、原子导弹和原子弹轰炸机进行装备。“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊不久前说：“西德由于同美国紧密合作的结果，已经成为一个核装备的国家”。从实际情况看，这一论断是毫不过分的。西德不仅用美国的原子武器装备自己的军队，而且还在美国支持下积极准备自己生产原子武器。去年夏天，美国同西德签订了一项“原子协定”，规定两国交换“核军事情报”。去年10月西欧联盟又在美国压力下批准西德生产“鹰”式导弹和“响尾蛇”式导弹，这实际是取消“巴黎协定”中不许西德生产原子武器等规定的第一步。最近西德已经同法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰正式签订协定，共同生产“鹰”式导弹。据西德人士估计，在原子武器生产方面，西德是具备工业基础和技术条件的。波恩政府今年1月份公布的一份材料表明，西德现有二百六十家公司生产各种原子能设备和有关的装置，包括放射性装置和核燃料等。据透露，西德已经勘探出五处铀矿，去年10月第一座铀矿已经开始生产。另外法本化学工业集团正在建造的一个生产重水（核燃料）的新工厂。投入生产后，西德的重水年产量将达一百五十吨左右，相当于美国目前年产量的83％。
    西德长期以来就利用分散的形式，在许多大康采恩和科学研究机构中进行原子研究工作。例如设在戈丁根的“马克思—普兰克科学研究促进会”，就设有许多有关原子科学的研究所。电气、化学、有色冶金等工业部门的一些大康采恩，例如法本化学工业集团的赫希斯特化学公司、通用电气公司、阿耳弗雷特·裴特尔森冶金公司等都设有自己的原子研究机构。根据波恩政府的决定，一些大康采恩负责人和金融巨头（包括德意志银行董事长阿布斯），在1955年共同组成了一个被称做“原子群神”的“原子委员会”，作为波恩原子能部的“谘询机构”。1959年夏天，这些垄断巨头们又组成了一个“原子协会”，以进一步联合各有关单位，统一调整原子研究工作。去年12月，西德的议会批准了波恩政府的一项“原子法”，目的是在“和平利用原子能”的幌子下进行生产原子武器的准备工作。
    波恩国防部本身也在用大量经费从事发展包括原子武器在内的新式武器。据慕尼黑“德意志周报”透露，到1961年4月1日为止的财政年度，西德用于原子武装的全部费用将达五百七十亿马克。至于西德以大量金钱和科学人员参加法国圣路易原子研究所的工作和法国在撒哈拉的原子弹试验，则已经是公开的秘密了。
    导弹基地到处皆是
    作为北大西洋集团原子战争计划中的“盾牌”的西德领土上，遍布了导弹基地。而最大最多的导弹基地是属于美国的。人们估计西德为美国导弹基地花的钱，起码有数十亿马克。美军在欧洲最大的导弹基地，就设在莱因兰—普伐尔葛州的凯撒劳登城。这个城旁边的一些小村镇，已经扩建成为美式现代化城市，到处充塞着美国军事人员。在波姆胡特城附近的大公路旁边，有连绵数公里的美军导弹部队驻地和军火库等，都由美国军队严密守卫。曾经有汽车在这段公路上因开得稍为慢了一点，而受到美军的鸣枪警告。在黑森州的达姆城附近大公路旁边，美军把导弹装置隐蔽在一排小树背后。但是到了准备演习时，导弹发射器就竖立起来，远远就能看见。在巴伐利亚州，邻近德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的格拉芬瓦尔和佛埃尔斯登，也都是美军在欧洲的重要军事基地，设有导弹装置。
    军事演习肆无忌惮
    西德“国防军”自己的导弹基地也正在增多。在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州，正在建立一个以鲁尔重工业区为中心的半圆形导弹地带。在波恩城东北方的森林地带，也设有导弹发射台。据社会民主党的新闻机关报道，西德海、空军基地集中的石勒苏益格—荷尔施泰因州，将成为北大西洋集团的第一号导弹堡垒。这个州的波罗的海海岸，将至少设置八个导弹发射台。据说这个州的空军演习场已经几乎占到全州土地面积的八分之一。许多城市的居民整天生活在飞机轰鸣声中。从汉堡到不来梅的一段公路上，汽车常常因碰上飞机低飞而发生事故。当地居民因不堪骚扰和损害，曾不断提出抗议。
    西德军队和驻西德美军还频繁地举行挑衅性的军事演习。去年一年中，仅大规模演习就至少举行了六次。这些演习的攻击方向是从北、西、西南三个方面针对着德意志民主共和国的。今年1月底2月初，美国第七军和西德军队联合举行的空前大规模“冬季盾牌”演习，是在紧邻德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克边境、面积约六千平方公里的地方举行的。这次演习共有六万名官兵参加，演习的内容是所谓“进攻的第一阶段”。在演习中还使用了原子武器，有二百多名北大西洋公约组织的军官到现场参观了“诚实的约翰”导弹的发射。据透露，这次大演习中，兵士和西德平民死伤很多，财产损失达九百万马克。波恩的备战活动已经越来越广泛地影响到西德居民的日常生活。据内政部不久前公布，计划到1961年末建成全国的“防空警报系统”的同时，还要在所有新建的住宅都设有防空洞。为了驱使人民为军事当局的备战活动服务，波恩政府在今年2月通过了一项“紧急服役法”，规定即便在和平时期，居民也有从事“紧急服役”的“义务”。
    战争叫嚣日益猖狂
    波恩政府在备战中继承了希特勒的衣钵：一面加紧建军，另一方面又用心理战驱使人民为它们的战争准备忍受牺牲。在这种情况下，西德的战争宣传也越来越嚣张。以记者身份出现在西德的美国战争煽动家施拉姆，从去年夏天以来已经在西德各大城市举行了二十多次演讲，还在“星”画报上连续发表长篇文章，公开叫嚣原子战争。他提出这样一种逻辑：如果他准确知道苏联要在某一天“发动进攻”，那么他将用“一切手段”在前几天开始一个“先发制人的战争”，但是因为他并不知道苏联什么时候会发动进攻，所以就干脆应当发动侵略战争。这个战争煽动家自己承认，他同三十多个基督教民主联盟（阿登纳党）议员是“朋友”，并且认识波恩政府的许多部长。他在各处演讲都是由阿登纳党的重要人物所主持的什么“拯救自由协会”、“国家政治舆论工作研究会”等等军国主义团体所组织的。一个希特勒法西斯时期的外交官员、老纳粹分子彼得·克拉斯脱，去年写了一本名字叫“赫鲁晓夫——在汉堡前边五十公里”的书，主张加强军备竞赛，进行反苏战争，并且叫喊“战争不能推迟”。类似这样的书还有不少，有的甚至公然说要“解放”东欧社会主义国家，并且“一直打到乌拉尔”。许多希特勒“国防军”的将军们利用回忆录的形式歪曲历史事实，宣扬希特勒的“英明”“勇敢”。此外宣扬法西斯战争、鼓励青年们“不用思考”，只管“顽强战斗”，“奋勇杀敌”的战争小丛书、小册子，据统计在西德去年一年就发行了一千五百万到二千万册。
    人们只要想到阿登纳、施特劳斯等人是怎样叫嚣反苏反共和“解放”德意志民主共和国等滥调的，对于西德战争宣传的泛滥，也就丝毫不会感到奇怪了。
    但是经过两次战争荼毒的德国人民，是不会再像过去那样易受军国主义者的欺骗的。波恩的原子备战已经激起人民越来越强烈的反对。尽管最近一年多来波恩政府加紧镇压和迫害人民反对原子武装的运动，可是西德人民反对波恩原子备战政策的斗争却越来越广泛、深入。同时西欧广大公众也对美国扶植西德进行原子备战感到深刻不安。波恩统治集团在美国怂恿下正走着希特勒发动侵略战争的老路。但是世界人民要求制止美国和西德战争势力这种罪恶活动的呼声，正在并且将继续不断地高涨。
