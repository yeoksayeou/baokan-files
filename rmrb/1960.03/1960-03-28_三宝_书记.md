    "Three Treasures" Secretary
    Li Bangning, Zundao Commune, Mianzhu County, Sichuan
    Our commune's Party Secretary was sent down from the county during the "Four Autumns" production last year. He's tall, with a thin face, and hands and feet that are long and large. He wears a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers.
    We folks up here in the mountains enjoy teasing people. No matter who comes here, if they stay for ten days or half a month, and you find something special about them, you're sure to give them a nickname. This new Party Secretary, he's got nimble legs, he speaks well, and he interacts with a lot of people, so of course he's going to get a "title." At first, someone started saying that the Party Secretary had three "treasures," and people started calling him "Three Treasures" Secretary behind his back.
    Actually, the three "treasures" are all ordinary things. One is straw sandals. Except for when he gets back to the commune at night to wash his feet and change into cloth shoes, whether it's sunny or rainy, windy or snowy, even in the coldest days of winter, he wears straw sandals. Some of the old women, seeing how hardworking he is, felt sorry for him and pulled him aside, saying, "You! In the dead of winter, when it's so cold, why don't you wear a pair of cloth shoes!" He always answers with a smile, "I'm used to wearing straw sandals, and I don't feel cold. Wearing straw sandals lets me cover more ground in a day, visit more districts, and learn more new agricultural production experiences from the commune members." So the young fellows made up a rhyme: "Light and nimble are the straw sandals, carrying the Secretary all around, he can run all over the commune in half a day, dozens of li are nothing to say."
    The second is a manure basket. As soon as the Secretary arrived, he wove two baskets himself. Carrying them with a hoe, he walked along, picking up manure along the way. Each time he filled a load, he gave it to a nearby district, averaging fifty jin of manure a day. After the story of the Secretary picking manure spread, the young fellows made another doggerel verse: "The Secretary has a manure basket, he uses it to collect manure every day, manure fertilizer grows a thousand jin of grain, accumulate manure a thousand loads, grain ten thousand measures."
    The third is a satchel. Some time ago, an elderly military dependent in the Fifth District saw the Secretary coming to the district every other day with a bag hanging on his body. He actually mistook him for a postman and stopped him one day to ask, "Comrade! Has there been any letter from our Shuisheng in the army?" The Secretary was stumped. The Secretary's satchel can be called a "treasure trove," it has everything. The first layer contains a toothbrush and towel; the second layer contains documents, newspapers, Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and some books of different sizes; the third layer contains red paper, a brush, and a square inkstone, plus an ink stick. There is another layer inside the satchel, which is empty. He puts anything he thinks is worth putting in it. Sometimes, if he finds insects in the rapeseed, he pulls out the seedlings and puts them in the bag; or if he sees that the dregs fertilizer hasn't been sifted finely, he'll grab a handful and put it in... The cadres in the district are most afraid of what's in this fourth layer. As soon as they see him rummaging in there, they know something's gone wrong. Because what he pulls out is either third-class seedlings or pests and diseases, and no one can argue. The first two "treasures" have poems, so there's no need to say anything about this "treasure." The poem goes: "The Secretary's satchel is heavy, each layer has its use, the last layer has great power, whoever it finds will blush."
    Strangely enough, before the name "Three Treasures" Secretary spread, people were very interested in these "three treasures," but after the name "Three Treasures" Secretary became known, after a long time, people gradually mentioned it less and less. It turned out that several of our commune's Party Secretaries had all become "Three Treasures" Secretaries, and there were also many "Three Treasures" Branch Secretaries, "Three Treasures" Directors, and even many "Three Treasures" Production Team Leaders and "Three Treasures" Commune Members.

### “三宝”书记

    “三宝”书记
    四川绵竹县遵道公社　李邦宁
    我们公社的党委书记是打去年“四秋”生产开始的时候，才从县上派下来的。高高的个子，瘦瘦的脸，一双手和两只脚板又长又大，一身蓝布棉袄裤。
    我们山边边上的人生来就好逗趣，不管是谁，只要来这儿呆上十天半月，你有什么特殊的地方叫人们发觉的话，准会给你起上个外号。这党委书记是新来不久的，腿又勤，话说得又好，接触的面又广，当然免不了要得上个“头衔”。起先，不知是谁传说党委书记有三件“宝贝”，人们在背后都管他叫“三宝”书记。
    其实三件“宝贝”都是平常东西。一件是草鞋。除开晚上他回到公社洗脚要换上布鞋外，不管天晴下雨、刮风飘雪，就是数九天，他也穿草鞋。有些老大娘看着他这样刻苦，怪心痛地拉着他说：“你呀！十冬腊月这么冷的天气，咋不穿双布鞋哟！”他总是笑迷迷地回答说：“穿惯草鞋了，也不觉着冷。穿草鞋一天能多跑点路，多转几个管区，好向社员多学习些新的农业生产经验。”小伙子们于是就编个顺口溜：“偏耳草鞋轻又巧，载着书记到处跑，半天跑遍全公社，几十里路说就到。”
    第二件是粪筐。书记一来就自个儿编了两个筐筐，用一把锄头担起，走一路，拣一路。每拣满一担，就交给附近管区，平均每天要拣五十斤粪。书记拣粪的事情传开后，小伙子们又编了一首打油诗：“书记有担粪筐筐，天天拣粪拿它装，粪肥百挑千斤谷，积粪千担万斤粮。”
    第三件是挎包。前些日子第五管区有个军属老大爷，看见书记三天两头到管区来时身上总挂个包包，竟把他错当成了邮递员，一天拦住他问：“同志！我们水生在部队上有信来没有？”一下把书记问倒了。书记这个挎包称得起“百宝囊”，啥子都装得有。第一层装的是牙刷、毛巾；第二层装的是文件、报纸、毛泽东选集和一些大小不一的书本；第三层装的是红纸、毛笔和一块四四方方的砚台，外带一条墨。挎包紧里面还有一层，是空的，遇着什么他认为值得装的就往里塞。有时发现菜子有虫，他就把苗拔出来装进包里；或者遇到渣肥没有筛细，也抓上一把装起……。这第四层袋里装的东西，管区的干部最害怕。他们一见他朝里翻，就晓得又出岔子了。因为他翻出来的东西不是三类苗就是病虫害，谁也休想辩护。前两“宝”都有诗，这一“宝”就不消说了。诗句是：“书记挎包装得重，一层都有一层用，最后一层威力大，相中了谁谁脸红。”
    说也怪，“三宝”书记的名字没有传开以前，人们对这“三宝”很感兴趣，可是“三宝”书记的名字叫开后，日子一长，提的人反而渐渐少了。原来我们公社的几个党委书记跟着全都成了“三宝”书记了，而且还出现了许多“三宝”支书、“三宝”主任，甚至还出现了不少“三宝”生产队长和“三宝”社员。
