Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 29th - The World Agricultural Fair in New Delhi closed after eighty-one days, during which over three million people visited the Chinese Exhibition Hall. Visitors to the Chinese pavilion included the President, Vice President, and Prime Minister of India, high-ranking officials, people from all walks of life, and large numbers of farmers from across India, as well as many foreign visitors.

During the approximately two and a half months leading up to the World Agricultural Fair's closing on February 29th, the Chinese pavilion held over eight hundred small seminars and discussions. Chinese agricultural experts and people's commune leaders explained various aspects of Chinese agriculture to several thousand Indian farmers, scholars, university professors, and agricultural students.

The small agricultural tools displayed in the Chinese pavilion were very popular with Indian farmers. Many visitors surrounded the exhibits, drawing or photographing diagrams, and requesting detailed brochures on the various agricultural machines and superior seeds.

Over sixteen thousand Indian visitors wrote their impressions in the guest book. They said: "The Chinese pavilion is of extremely great significance to underdeveloped countries, we can learn a lot"; "The Chinese pavilion proves that only people liberated from enslavement can achieve great achievements."

Many Indian visitors asked Chinese friends for autographs and requested to take photos with members of the Chinese exhibition group. Especially in the final days before the Chinese pavilion was to close, visitors flocked to the Chinese pavilion every day, staying there until late at night. Indian visitors assured their Chinese friends: "The border dispute between the two countries will be resolved through the friendly efforts of the two prime ministers and peoples." They warmly welcomed the upcoming visit of the Chinese Premier to India and sincerely wished "the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples to last forever."

During the fair, personnel from the Chinese exhibition group and the exhibition halls of many Indian states frequently made friendly visits to each other. They exchanged experiences in agricultural production and agricultural products. The exhibition hall of Madras State in India, which participated in the fair, referred to the technical materials of the Chinese wooden rice transplanter, and with the help of the staff of the Chinese Pavilion, manufactured a rice transplanter, which was displayed in their exhibition hall.

During the fair, the Chinese exhibition group visited the Soviet pavilion, the German Democratic Republic pavilion, the Polish pavilion, and the Mongolian pavilion. They also visited the Burmese pavilion, the Iraqi pavilion, the Afghan pavilion, and the Ceylon pavilion to learn about the agricultural production experiences of these countries. The Soviet pavilion was next to the Chinese pavilion, and the Soviets warmly invited the Chinese to visit their exhibition hall. Soviet agricultural machinery expert Mirza Akhmedov, upon hearing that the Chinese experts needed materials on advanced agricultural machinery, personally delivered the relevant materials to the Chinese pavilion and invited the Chinese experts to watch him operate the machinery.

The director of the Burmese pavilion, accompanied by Burmese rice experts, visited the Chinese pavilion twice and watched the film on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." They exchanged experiences on rice production with Chinese experts. When the Chinese exhibition group visited the Burmese pavilion, they presented the exhibition group with twelve varieties of Burmese rice.

The close friendship formed between a milkman from Delhi and Chen Bingyin, the leader of the Chinese exhibition group and the leader of the Chaya Mountain People's Commune, typically illustrates the Indian working people's friendship toward the Chinese people. When the milkman first visited the Chinese pavilion, Chen Bingyin had a friendly conversation with him, explained many questions he raised, and they became friends. The milkman and his family brought various Indian foods and fruits to the Chinese pavilion to see Chen Bingyin. In the last few days before the closing, the milkman came every day, trying to spend a few minutes with Chen Bingyin. They also took pictures together as souvenirs and exchanged addresses. Today, he came to the Chinese pavilion for the fifteenth time to say goodbye to Chen Bingyin. He said, "I will never forget this friendship."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 29th - The World Agricultural Fair in New Delhi, which lasted for eighty-one days, closed on the evening of the 29th.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru presided over the closing ceremony, which was attended by more than four thousand guests. Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan presented awards to each foreign exhibition hall, outstanding domestic exhibition halls, and units. In his speech, Radhakrishnan said that through this first international-scale agricultural fair held in India, India has learned a lot from the participating countries. He said that 70% of India's population is engaged in agriculture, but it still needs to import food, which is a national shame. He expressed his hope that this deficiency will be overcome by farmers through hard work and increased knowledge of agricultural production.

In his speech, Nehru expressed his hope that the Indian farmers who have visited this fair will spread the wealth of knowledge they have gained to others in the countryside, so that India's entire agriculture can benefit.
