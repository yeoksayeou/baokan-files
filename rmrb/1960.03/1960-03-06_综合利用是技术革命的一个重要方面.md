    As the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization surges forward, the scale of comprehensive resource utilization in our country is expanding day by day. Scientific research departments have made it an important research project, and many enterprises regard it as an important aspect of the current technological revolution. For example, Jilin Dyestuff Chemical Plant has decided to make the comprehensive utilization of waste water, waste gas, and waste residue an important part of technological innovation and technological revolution. Comprehensive resource utilization is a revolution in resource utilization. Vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization can use existing resources to produce more, better, and cheaper means of production and means of livelihood, create more wealth, support the continued Great Leap Forward, and accelerate socialist construction.
    Why is comprehensive utilization an important aspect of the technological revolution? This is because the implementation of comprehensive utilization can most rationally, economically, and fully utilize resources. For example, coal is mostly used directly as fuel for power generation, trains, ships, cooking, and heating. This is one way to utilize coal. In terms of the utilization of coal's thermal energy, generally only 20%-25% is utilized, as low as about 10%, and as high as only 45%-50%. In other words, burning coal directly leaves about one-half to three-quarters or even more of the resource unutilized. Coal contains even more valuable industrial raw materials, such as tar and benzene, which are wasted. If comprehensive utilization is implemented, that is, before combustion, it is processed through dry distillation and gasification, then a large amount of tar, gasoline, and raw materials for manufacturing plastics, dyes, synthetic rubber, and chemical fertilizers can be extracted from the coal. For example, using high-temperature dry distillation to process 10 million tons of coal can yield about 400,000 to 500,000 tons of tar and about 50,000 to 60,000 tons of refined benzene. From 400,000 to 500,000 tons of tar, 24,000 to 30,000 tons of gasoline and 100,000 to 200,000 tons of light and heavy diesel can be extracted. Using 50,000 to 60,000 tons of refined benzene can manufacture more than 33,000 to 40,000 tons of Kapron (a kind of synthetic fiber), which is equivalent to the use of about 5 million to 5.5 million dan of cotton. The gas and coke (or semi-coke) produced by coal after processing are still good fuels, and the coal ash residue after combustion can also be used to manufacture cement and extract valuable rare metals. Coal is one of the largest resources in our country, with a production of 347.78 million tons last year. Let's not even talk about comprehensively utilizing all the coal, but just say that we process 100 million tons annually. Then, how great is the wealth we get from coal!
    Coal is like this, and so are other large-scale resources such as petroleum gas and natural gas produced during crude oil processing, industrial waste liquid, sewage sludge, mine tailings, seawater, wood, various agricultural and sideline products, wild plants, animal viscera and scraps, and fish waste. Without comprehensive utilization, some have only one or very few uses, and some have no use at all. Some are not only useless but also harmful. For example, the waste gas of some chemical plants will kill trees if they touch them, and if they touch wet clothes, the clothes will change color; waste liquid flowing into the ground will corrode sewers and destroy the soil. Urban sewage sludge breeds bacteria and is harmful to hygiene. Recycling and comprehensively utilizing these waste gases, waste liquids, and sewage sludge can produce many useful things. Therefore, the implementation of comprehensive utilization can turn a large number of "waste products" into treasures, a large number of "harmful things" into beneficial things, and one thing for one use into multiple uses. Truly achieve the full use of everything and fundamentally overcome the waste of resources.
    Some people regard the comprehensive utilization of resources as a temporary measure to solve the contradiction of insufficient raw materials. They believe that the reason why we need to comprehensively utilize resources now is only because the industry is not developed enough, and the developed resources cannot meet the needs. In the future, when the industry is developed and the developed resources are sufficient, comprehensive utilization will not be necessary. This view is incorrect. With this view, a passive attitude will be adopted towards the comprehensive utilization of resources. It is true that the comprehensive utilization of resources can more effectively overcome the contradiction of insufficient raw materials and materials, but this is by no means an expedient measure, but a long-term technical policy for socialist construction. Because the development of production technology is not only reflected in the progress of equipment and tools, but also in the rational and economical use of resources. We must carry out a technological revolution, not only to revolutionize backward equipment and tools, and use modern equipment and tools in production, but also to revolutionize the backward state of resource utilization and highly comprehensively utilize resources. Comprehensive resource utilization is one of the main signs of industrial modernization and one of the main signs of measuring a country's industrial technical level. It is not that resources are comprehensively utilized only when the industry is not developed, but that the more developed the industry, the more resources must be comprehensively utilized; the higher the degree of industrial modernization, the higher the degree of comprehensive resource utilization.
    Some people think that our country is vast and rich in resources, and its natural resources are among the few in the world, and we can survive without comprehensive utilization. This view is also incorrect and incompatible with our socialist system. In capitalist countries, capitalists only carry out comprehensive resource utilization when they can guarantee maximum profits. In order to seek maximum profits, deliberately abandoning certain resources and causing great waste to society is common in capitalist society. Socialism is not like this. Chairman Mao repeatedly told us to build the country diligently and thriftily, run factories diligently and thriftily, run cooperatives diligently and thriftily, run schools diligently and thriftily, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily. "Thrift" means saving. Opposing waste and practicing thrift is a fundamental principle of socialism. We must not only use funds thriftily and use labor thriftily, but also use all resources thriftily. When our country was "poor and blank," we had to do this, and we will have to do this even when we become rich and strong in the future. Therefore, the abundance of natural resources in our country does not mean that we can waste them carelessly, but only means that the world for comprehensively utilizing resources is extremely broad, and only means that the task of comprehensively utilizing resources is extremely arduous. In socialist construction, we must not only gradually develop all the resources that can be utilized, but also give the developed resources the most rational, economical, and full utilization. The socialist system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system. We must not only catch up with and surpass the major capitalist countries in terms of construction speed, output and quality of industrial and agricultural products, and labor productivity, but also catch up with and surpass the major capitalist countries in terms of comprehensive resource utilization. We should have such great ambitions.
    Since comprehensive resource utilization is a product of modern industrial technology, especially a product of modern chemical industry, is it necessary to wait until science and technology are very developed, the technical level of modern industry is very high, and a large number of scientific and technical talents proficient in various businesses have been cultivated before we can start comprehensive resource utilization? Of course not. Comprehensive resource utilization requires some scientific and technological knowledge. There is a distance between not knowing comprehensive utilization and knowing comprehensive utilization, but this is not an insurmountable gap, but can be quickly eliminated. Learning is the way to eliminate this distance. How to learn? Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, and use is also learning, and it is more important learning." He also said: "Revolutionary war is a matter for the people. Often, they don't learn it well before they do it, but they learn it while doing it. Doing it is learning." Chairman Mao's words are equally applicable to learning the skills to fight against nature. In the past year or two, we have adhered to learning in practice and adhering to learning comprehensive utilization in comprehensive utilization. Therefore, in comprehensively utilizing coal, wood, rice, corn, sorghum, and sugarcane, we have begun to build a number of comprehensive production factories or workshops, manufactured some products, and cultivated a number of technical talents. Of course, there is a process from not knowing to knowing, from knowing little to knowing a lot. In the beginning, the comprehensive utilization of resources may not be sufficient, and there may be various shortcomings, such as some costs being relatively high, and some qualities not being ideal, etc., which are all unavoidable. These shortcomings can only be quickly overcome by adhering to learning in practice and improving in practice. Learning comprehensive utilization skills in the practice of comprehensive utilization will not only most rapidly develop our country's comprehensive resource utilization cause, but also powerfully promote the development of our country's science and technology.
    The learning of comprehensive utilization in practice that we are talking about refers not only to the practice of small-scale scientific experiments, but also to the production practice of mass movements for large-scale comprehensive utilization. Small-scale scientific experiments are needed, and it is more important to widely carry them out in large, medium, and small enterprises. The idea that comprehensive resource utilization must have the latest modern equipment is also one-sided. It is good to have modern equipment, but comprehensive utilization can also be carried out temporarily without modern equipment. For example, Hunan Qunli Coal Mine, which has comprehensively utilized coal to produce 25 products such as gasoline, diesel, carbolic acid, paraffin wax, ammonia water, plastics, and coke, is mainly based on indigenous equipment and indigenous methods, and has been built up by combining indigenous and foreign methods. The staff and workers of the Yichun Forest Area have erected simple stoves and installed an iron pot, and can also use "waste products" such as pine roots, bark, and pine needles to extract more than ten kinds of forest chemical products such as rosin and tannin extract. These vivid facts powerfully prove that whether or not resources can be comprehensively utilized does not depend on whether the equipment is foreign or indigenous, nor does it depend on whether the factory is large or small. The decisive factor is still people's mental state. The workers said well: "Dare to think to be able to think it out, dare to do to be able to do it." If politics is not in command, even thinking is not dared, and no matter how big the factory is and no matter how foreign the equipment is, no significant achievements will be made. With politics in command, the staff and workers have established lofty ambitions to climb the peak of comprehensive utilization technology, dare to think and dare to do, and are not afraid of difficulties. Not only can large enterprises do it, but also medium and small enterprises can do it; not only can they do it with foreign equipment and foreign methods, but also with indigenous equipment and indigenous methods. Especially since the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization has been vigorously carried out, the production capacity of many enterprises has increased several times, and it is urgently necessary to expand the comprehensive utilization of resources, open up new sources of raw materials and materials, expand the variety of raw materials and materials, and increase the quantity of raw materials. Therefore, enterprises in the metallurgical industry, chemical industry, electric power industry, petroleum industry, coal industry, building materials industry, light industry, transportation industry, and various agricultural and sideline product processing, regardless of size, regardless of foreign or indigenous, should all regard the comprehensive utilization of resources as an important aspect of the current technological revolution, make plans, rely on the masses, and actively implement it. Of course, in promoting comprehensive utilization, we must proceed from reality, large if possible, small if possible, foreign if possible, indigenous if possible, from small to large, from low-level to high-level, and carry out comprehensive utilization by combining large, medium, and small, combining foreign and indigenous, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale.
    Comprehensive resource utilization often involves several economic sectors. We must advocate close cooperation between departments and comprehensive business operations of enterprises. The comprehensive utilization of certain resources may not be economical from the perspective of the department providing the raw materials, but it is very economical from the perspective of the department using the raw materials. When all the accounts are added up, it is beneficial to the country. The comprehensive utilization of some resources may not be economical from the perspective of the department using the raw materials, but it is very economical for other departments, and it is also beneficial to the country when all the accounts are added up. In this case, we must establish an overall concept and oppose departmentalism. Every department and enterprise must proceed from the overall situation and, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, divide the work and cooperate. As long as it is beneficial to the overall situation, we must actively handle the products produced by comprehensive utilization, whether they belong to the scope of our own department or to the scope of other departments; we must actively handle those that we can use, and we must actively handle those that are supplied to others; we must actively handle those that are "cost-effective" to ourselves, and we must actively handle those that are "not cost-effective"; we must actively handle those for which the conditions are already available, and we must actively create conditions for those for which the conditions are not yet available. Taking on the difficulties ourselves and leaving the convenience to others, this communist style of cooperation must be greatly promoted in the work of comprehensive utilization.
    Comprehensive resource utilization is a major matter related to the overall interests of the country's socialist construction. Our work of comprehensive resource utilization has just begun, and many major technical problems remain to be solved, many important comprehensive utilization fields remain for us to occupy, and specialized institutions for comprehensive utilization must also be established. However, with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the spirited 650 million people, our future is boundless in terms of comprehensive resource utilization. We must muster our energy and, in the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, greatly advance the work of comprehensive resource utilization!

### 综合利用是技术革命的一个重要方面

    综合利用是技术革命的一个重要方面
    随着以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的迅猛开展，我国综合利用资源的规模正在一天天扩大。科学研究部门已把它作为一项重要的研究项目，许多企业更把它作为当前技术革命运动中的一个重要方面，例如吉林染化厂就决定把综合利用废水、废气、废渣作为技术革新和技术革命的重要内容之一。综合利用资源是资源利用的革命。大力开展综合利用，就可以利用现有的资源，生产出更多、更好、更便宜的生产资料和生活资料，创造更多的财富，支援继续跃进，加速社会主义建设。
    为什么说综合利用是技术革命的一个重要方面呢？这是因为实行综合利用，才能最合理、最节约、最充分地利用资源。例如煤炭，我们现在大都直接用来作发电、火车、轮船、烧饭和取暖的燃料。这是利用煤炭的一个方法。按照煤炭热能的利用来讲，一般只利用了20％—25％，低的只有10％左右，高的也不过45％—50％。也就是说，用煤来直接燃烧，大约有二分之一到四分之三甚至更多的资源没有得到利用。煤里含有价值更大的工业原料，如焦油、苯等都白白地浪费了。如果实行综合利用，即在燃烧之前，经过干馏、汽化加工处理，那么就可以从煤里提炼出大量的焦油、汽油以及制造塑料、染料、合成橡胶、合成纤维、化学肥料的原料。如用高温干馏方法每加工处理一千万吨煤，仅焦油就可收四十到五十万吨左右，精苯五、六万吨左右。从四、五十万吨焦油里，可以提炼汽油二万四千到三万吨，轻重柴油十万到二十万吨。用五、六万吨精苯，可以制造三万三千多吨到四万吨卡普隆（一种合成纤维），约相当于五百到五百五十万担棉花的用途。煤炭经过加工处理所产生的煤气和焦炭（或半焦），仍然是很好的燃料，燃烧后的煤灰渣还可以制造水泥，还可以从中提炼贵重的稀有金属。煤炭是我国产量最大的资源之一，去年就生产了三亿四千七百八十万吨。我们且不说把所有的煤都综合利用，只说每年加工处理一亿吨吧，那么我们从煤炭里得到的财富是多么巨大啊！
    煤炭是这样，其他如原油加工时产生的石油气、天然气、工业下脚废液、污水污泥、矿碴、海水、木材、各种农副产品、野生植物、畜类内脏和下脚、鱼类废弃物等等大宗资源，也是这样。不实行综合利用，有的只有一种或极少几种用途，有的完全没有用途；有的不但没有用，而且还有害。例如有些化工厂的废气，碰到树木，树木就会枯死，碰到湿衣服，衣服就变颜色；废液流到地下，就腐蚀下水道，破坏土壤。城市污水污泥滋长细菌，有碍卫生。把这些废气、废液、污水污泥加以回收，综合利用，就可以制成很多有用的东西。所以，实行综合利用，就可以变大量的“废物”为宝物，变大量的“有害之物”为有利之物，变一物一用为多用。真正做到物尽其用，从根本上克服资源的浪费。
    有人把资源的综合利用，看做解决原材料不够的矛盾的临时措施。他们认为，现在所以需要综合利用资源，只是因为工业还不发达，开发的资源不能满足需要，将来工业发达了，开发的资源充足了，综合利用就不必要了。这种看法是不对的。有了这种看法，对资源的综合利用，就会采取消极态度。不错，综合利用资源，可以比较有效地克服某些原料材料不足的矛盾，但是，这绝不是权宜之计，而是社会主义建设的长远的技术方针。因为生产技术的发展，既表现在设备工具的进步上面，也表现在合理地节约地利用资源上面。我们要进行技术革命，不仅革落后设备和工具的命，在生产中使用现代设备和工具，还革利用资源方面落后状态的命，高度地综合利用资源。综合利用资源，是工业现代化的主要标志之一，是衡量一个国家工业技术水平的主要标志之一。不是工业不发达才综合利用资源，而是工业越发达越要综合利用资源；工业现代化程度越高，资源的综合利用程度越高。
    有的人认为我国地大物博，自然资源之丰富，是世界上少有的，不搞综合利用也能过得去。这种看法也是不对的，和我们的社会主义制度不相容的。在资本主义国家。资本家只有在能够保证最大限度利润时才进行资源的综合利用。为了谋求最大限度的利润，故意废弃某些资源不用，给社会造成极大的浪费，在资本主义社会中是屡见不鲜的。社会主义却不是这样。毛主席一再告诉我们，要勤俭建国，勤俭办工厂，勤俭办合作社，勤俭办学校，勤俭办一切事业。“俭”就是节约。反对浪费，厉行节约是社会主义的根本原则。我们不但要节约地使用资金，节约地使用劳动力，还要节约地使用一切资源。我们国家“又穷又白”的时候，要这样办，就是将来又富又强起来了，也要这样办。所以，我国自然资源之丰富，决不意味着可以满不在乎地浪费，而只意味着综合利用资源的天地是极其广阔的，只意味着综合利用资源的任务极其繁重。在社会主义建设中，我们不只要把一切可以利用的资源都逐步开发出来，而且要把开发出来的资源，给以最合理、最节约、最充分的利用。社会主义制度比资本主义制度具有无比的优越性，我们不但要在建设速度方面、在工农业产品产量和质量方面、在劳动生产率方面赶上和超过资本主义大国，还要在资源的综合利用方面赶上和超过资本主义大国。我们应当有这样的雄心大志。
    综合利用资源，既然是现代工业技术的产物，特别是现代化学工业的产物，那么是不是一定等到科学技术非常发达，现代工业技术水平非常高，精通各种业务的科学技术人才大量造就起来以后，才能开始综合利用资源呢？当然不是。综合利用资源，是需要懂得一些科学技术知识的。从不懂得综合利用到懂得综合利用之间有个距离，但这并不是不可逾越的鸿沟，而是可以迅速消灭的。学习就是消灭这个距离的方法。怎样学习呢？毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”又说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”毛主席这些话，同样适用于学习跟自然作战的本领。最近一、二年来，我们坚持了在实践中学习，坚持了在综合利用中学习综合利用，所以在综合利用煤炭、木材、稻谷、玉米、高粱、甘蔗等方面，开始建设了一批综合生产的工厂或车间，制造了一些产品，造就了一批技术人才。当然，从不懂到懂，从懂得不多到懂得多，要有一个过程。在开始的时候，资源的综合利用可能不够充分，可能有这样那样的缺点，如有的成本比较高，有的质量不够理想等等，这都是难免的。这些缺点，也只有坚持在实践中学习，在实践中提高，才能迅速地克服。在综合利用的实践中学习综合利用本领，不仅能够最迅速地发展我国的综合利用资源事业，而且将有力地推动我国科学技术的发展。
    我们所讲的在实践中学习综合利用，不仅是指小型的科学试验的实践，而且是指大搞综合利用的群众运动的生产实践。小型的科学试验是需要的，更重要的是在大中小型企业中广泛地开展。以为综合利用资源一定要有最新的现代设备的想法，也是片面的。有现代设备固然好，暂时没有现代设备也可以搞综合利用。例如已经综合利用煤炭生产汽油、柴油、石碳酸、石蜡、氨水、塑料、焦炭等二十五种产品的湖南群力煤矿，就是以土设备、土办法为主，用土洋结合的办法搞起来的。伊春林区的职工，架起了简陋的炉灶，安上一口铁锅，也能利用松根、树皮、松针叶等“废物”提炼出松香、栲胶等十多种森林化工产品来。这些活生生的事实有力地证明，能不能综合利用资源，并不决定于设备是洋的还是土的，也不决定于工厂是大的还是小的，决定的因素还是人们的精神状态。工人们说得好：“敢想才能想得出，敢做才能做得到。”政治不挂帅，连想都不敢想，工厂再大，设备再洋，也不会做出显著的成绩来。政治挂了帅，职工群众树立了攀登综合利用技术高峰的雄心壮志，敢想敢干，不畏艰难，不但大型企业可以搞，中小型企业也可以搞；不但用洋设备、洋办法可以搞，用土设备、土办法也可以搞。特别是以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来以后，许多企业的生产能力成倍地提高，就迫切需要通过扩大资源的综合利用，开辟原料材料的新来源，扩大原料材料品种，增加原材料的数量。因此，冶金工业、化学工业、电力工业、石油工业、煤炭工业、建筑材料工业、轻工业、交通运输业和各种农副产品加工的企业，不分大小，不分洋土，都应当把综合利用资源作为当前技术革命中的一个重要方面，作出规划，依靠群众，积极实行。当然，在推广综合利用的工作中，必须要从实际出发，能大则大，能小则小，能洋则洋，能土则土，从小到大，从低级到高级，以大中小结合、洋土结合、大搞群众运动的方法来进行综合利用。
    综合利用资源，往往牵涉若干经济部门，必须提倡各部门之间的密切协作和企业综合经营。某些资源的综合利用，从提供原料的部门来说，可能并不经济，但从使用原料的部门来说却十分经济，算起总账来，对国家有利。有些资源的综合利用，从使用原料的部门来说，可能并不经济，但对其他部门却十分经济，算总账也对国家有利。在这种情况下，必须树立整体观念，反对本位主义。每一个部门和企业，都要从全局出发，在党委的统一领导下，分工合作。只要对全局有利，综合利用所生产出来的产品，是属于自己部门范围的固然要积极地办，属于别的部门范围的也要积极地办；自己用得着的固然要积极地办，供给别人使用的，也要积极地办，属于别的部门范围的也要积极地办；于自己“合算”的固然要积极地办，“不合算”的也要积极地办；条件已经具备的固然要积极地办，条件还不具备的，也要积极创造条件。困难自己担当起来，方便留给别人，这种共产主义的协作风格，在综合利用的工作中，必须大大发扬。
    综合利用资源，是关系到国家社会主义建设整体利益的大事情。我们的资源综合利用工作还刚刚开始，许多重大的技术问题还有待于我们解决，许多重要的综合利用领域有待我们去占领，还要建立起综合利用的专门机构。但是，我们有党和毛主席的领导，有意气风发的六亿五千万人民，在综合利用资源方面，我们的前途是无量的。我们必须鼓足干劲，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，把综合利用资源的工作大大推进一步！
