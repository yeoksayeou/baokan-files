    This newspaper reports: Wuxi Qingfeng Textile Factory is actively supporting agriculture. They have further developed the experience of factory-commune cooperation. All the factory's workshops, departments, and even units such as canteens, hospitals, nurseries, and clubs, are using the method of "matched departments, comprehensive cooperation" to comprehensively and deeply support the people's communes.

    This factory has done a lot of work to support agricultural production in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In December last year, the factory decided to partner with Guangyi Commune in Wuxi County. The factory's Party Committee Secretary took personal command and established a Support Agriculture Committee. The workshops and departments also established corresponding leading groups. Subsequently, the factory's Party Committee organized responsible cadres from various departments to go deep into the partner commune to investigate the situation, understand the needs, and jointly formulate plans for agricultural technical transformation with the commune cadres. After returning to the factory, the commune's plans were distributed to all factory workers for discussion, and specific plans for supporting agriculture were formulated from the bottom up by each department and the entire factory. Based on the commune's focus on vegetable production and its goal of basically achieving water conservancy and mechanization within two years, they focused on current production, rushing to manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery and trial-produce agricultural machinery for planting vegetables and breaking soil. On the other hand, they used even greater efforts to help the commune arm and develop commune-run industry, improving the commune's own ability to carry out technical transformation. Based on the existing industrial situation in the commune, it was decided to first equip the agricultural machinery manufacturing plant and the brick, woodworking, and other three factories. At the same time, based on the commune's need to develop vegetable production and pig raising, they helped the commune establish sulfuric acid, alcohol, and veterinary drug factories. The commune-run agricultural machinery factory lacked casting equipment, so the Qingfeng Textile Factory's electromechanical workshop sent surplus casting equipment such as iron melting furnaces and sandboxes to the agricultural machinery factory, helping to establish a casting section. They also sent technicians to the factory to provide technical guidance. In just one month, the agricultural machinery factory was able to cast water pumps. The commune brick factory purchased an old brick-making machine from another place last year, but it had been sitting in the warehouse because they didn't know how to install it. After learning about this, the Qingfeng Textile Factory immediately sent Yu Aju, an eighth-grade master from the electromechanical workshop, to help with the installation. Yu Aju didn't return to the factory until the workers at the brick factory learned how to use the technology. In order to reduce the labor intensity of the brick workers when climbing the kiln, the electromechanical workshop also sent a 30-meter-long conveyor belt. With the help of the Qingfeng Textile Factory, the factory innovated its technology, and the brick-making efficiency quickly increased from an average of 2,000 bricks per person per day to 4,000 bricks.

    Recently, they have also used the method of factory-commune joint ventures to help the commune build three new factories: sulfuric acid, alcohol, and veterinary drugs. The factory allocated a portion of the funds from running "subsidiary factories" and the workshops actively collected and manufactured some equipment as investment in the commune, which will be repaid by the commune year by year. The three factories were quickly established in this way and have already trial-produced products such as chemical fertilizers, highly effective pesticides, pig feed, and medicines for treating pig diseases.

    The office staff of this factory also found a direction to support agriculture by going to the commune for investigation and visits. The accounting staff of the finance management department found some confusion in the financial management system of the commune's agricultural machinery factory and immediately sent two accountants to help. In less than a month, they helped the accountants of the agricultural machinery factory clear up the original accounts, establish new accounts, and established a team economic accounting system, greatly improving the factory's financial management. The factory's supply and marketing department sent people to the commune to investigate the warehouse management work. Based on the factory's warehouse management experience, they helped the commune's experiment station establish a card registration system for the receipt, storage, and payment of seeds, quickly reversing the chaotic situation in the past where there were many varieties of seeds and no one in charge of managing them. The staff of the production planning department originally thought that there was nothing to do in the countryside, but now they have also established contact with the Dinging Village Brigade to help formulate production plans.

    Driven by the workshops and departments, the factory's nurseries, health clinics, canteens, clubs, and other departments have also taken active action, and according to their own work content, they have gone to the countryside to establish contact with the relevant departments of the commune. The director and nursery staff of the factory's nursery have gone to the Youdu Brigade of this commune four times to teach children's care knowledge and help train childcare workers and educators. The factory's health clinic helped the commune hospital establish a health station between the two most remote brigades, Mao'an and Changshanfang, and supported some medical equipment to help train medical and health workers. The factory's canteen also established contact with the Mao'an Brigade canteen, introduced advanced rice steaming experience, and helped them improve canteen management. The factory's club extracted more than 2,000 books to expand the commune's library and began to tutor the commune's amateur cultural troupe.

    Qingfeng Textile Factory's adoption of this method of "matched departments, comprehensive cooperation" has powerfully promoted the comprehensive development of the commune's production and management, and further stimulated the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses of commune members. Recently, the production teams of this commune have proposed to the commune Party committee that the contracted production target of vegetables this year should be increased from the original 15,000 catties per mu to 20,000 catties per mu, and guarantee to achieve one pig per mu, so as to better support the urban people.

    无锡庆丰纺织厂把厂社挂钩的经验推进一步
    条条对口　全面支援农业
    车间帮助发展生产　科室协助搞好管理　食堂等辅导办好福利事业
    本报讯　无锡市庆丰纺织厂积极支援农业。他们进一步发展了厂、社挂钩的经验，全厂各车间、科室，以至食堂、医院、托儿所、俱乐部等单位以“条条对口，全面协作”的办法，全面深入地支援人民公社。
    这个厂几年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，对支援农业生产做了不少工作。去年12月，工厂确定与无锡县的广益公社挂钩，并由厂党委书记亲自挂帅，建立了支援农业委员会，各车间、科室也都相应地建立了领导小组。随后，厂党委组织各部门的负责干部深入到挂钩的公社调查情况，了解需要，并与公社干部共同制订了进行农业技术改造的规划。回厂后，把公社的规划发给全厂职工讨论，自下而上地制订了各部门和全厂的支援农业的具体计划。他们根据这个公社以蔬菜生产为主的特点，以及在两年内基本实现水利化、机械化等要求，一方面从当前生产着眼，突击赶制排灌机械和试制起菜、碎土等农业机械；另一方面，则以更大的力量，帮助公社武装和发展社办工业，提高公社本身进行技术改造的能力。他们根据这个公社现有工业的情况，决定首先武装农业机械制造厂和制砖、木器等三个工厂；同时，根据这个公社发展蔬菜生产和养猪事业的需要，帮助公社建立了硫酸、酒精和兽药等三个工厂。社办的农业机械厂缺少铸造设备，庆丰纺织厂的机电车间就把本车间多余的熔铁炉、砂箱等铸造设备送给农业机械厂，帮助建立了铸造工段，同时还派出技术工人到厂内进行技术指导。仅一个月的时间，这个农机厂就能铸造水泵了。公社制砖厂去年从外地购来了一台旧的制砖机，由于不会安装，一直搁在仓库内。庆丰纺织厂知道后，立即派机电车间的八级老师傅余阿菊去帮助突击安装，一直到制砖厂工人学会了使用技术，余阿菊才回厂。为了减轻制砖工人上窑爬坡时的劳动强度，机电车间还送来了一件三十米长的输送带。这个厂由于在庆丰纺织厂的帮助下，革新了技术，制砖效率很快由每人每天平均二千块提高到四千块。
    最近，他们又用厂社合办方式，帮助公社新建了硫酸、酒精和兽药三个工厂。工厂从办“子厂”的资金中拨出一部分现款，各车间积极地筹集和制造了一些设备，作为向公社投资，以后由公社逐年偿还。三个工厂就这样很快地办了起来，并已试制出化肥、高效农药、猪饲料和治猪病的药剂等产品。
    这个厂的科室人员通过到公社去调查访问，也找到了支援农业的方向。财务管理科的会计人员，发现公社农业机械厂在财务管理制度上有些混乱，随即抽出了两个会计前去帮助。不到一个月，他们就帮助农业机械厂的会计清理了原有账目，建立了新账，并建立了班组经济核算制度，使这个厂的财务管理大为改观。工厂供销科则派人到公社调查了仓库管理工作的情况。他们根据工厂仓库管理经验，帮助公社试验站建立了对种籽的收进、保管和付出卡片登记等制度，迅速扭转了过去由于种子品种繁多而又无专人管理的混乱情况。生产计划科的职工，原来认为到农村没什么工作好做，现在也与丁村大队建立了联系，帮助制订生产计划。
    在车间和科室的带动下，工厂的托儿所、保健所、食堂、俱乐部等各部门也都积极行动起来，根据自己的工作内容，纷纷下乡与公社的有关部门建立了联系。工厂的托儿所所长和保育员曾先后四次到这个社的尤渡大队去传授幼儿保育知识，帮助培养保育员和教养员。工厂保健所帮助公社医院在最偏僻的毛岸和长善坊两个大队之间建立了一个保健站，并支援了部分医疗设备，帮助培训医务卫生员。工厂的食堂也与毛岸大队食堂建立了联系，介绍先进的蒸饭经验，帮助他们改进食堂管理。工厂的俱乐部抽出了二千多本图书，扩大了公社的图书室，并且开始辅导公社的业余文工团。
    庆丰纺织厂采取这种“条条对口，全面协作”的办法，有力地促进了公社的生产和管理等各项工作的全面发展，进一步激发了广大社员的革命干劲。最近，这个公社的各生产队纷纷向公社党委提出，要求把今年蔬菜的包产指标，由原来每亩一万五千斤提高到二万斤，并保证实现一亩一头猪，以便更好地支援城市人民。
