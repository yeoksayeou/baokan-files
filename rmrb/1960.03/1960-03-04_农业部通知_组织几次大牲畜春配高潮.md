Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice requiring all areas to seize the crucial spring season, immediately mobilize, and launch a large-scale mating and breeding campaign for large livestock, striving for a major development of China's large livestock this year.

The notice pointed out that large livestock have long gestation periods, with cows requiring nine months and horses and donkeys even longer, and generally only producing one offspring at a time. Therefore, to achieve significant development in large livestock, it is necessary to strengthen spring mating efforts.

The notice said that in 1959, the breeding situation of large livestock in most regions and communes had begun to improve, with a few regions and communes developing very well. However, on a national scale, large livestock remain the weakest link in animal husbandry, and a major development in large livestock must be achieved in 1960. Quickly complete mating preparation work. This work includes: formulating mating plans and distributing them to production teams, adopting the "two fixeds" (fixed person, fixed animal) and "two guarantees" (guarantee mating, guarantee pregnancy) method, implementing them in the feeding rooms, strengthening the feeding and management of female animals to promote early estrus, adding grass and feed to breeding males to enhance their mating ability; adopting the method of prioritizing local selection of superior breeding stock and organizing inter-regional, inter-commune, and surplus/deficiency adjustments to solve the difficulty of insufficient breeding stock; establishing mating stations in every commune and team, vigorously developing artificial insemination work, training insemination technicians, and promptly resolving the issue of artificial insemination equipment.

The notice believes that in terms of mating methods, all regions should adopt various methods such as batch mating, leading breeding males to the fields for mating, early morning mating, and nighttime mating to overcome the contradiction between mating and draft work. Female animals that are too dispersed should be appropriately concentrated during the peak mating season. Female animals used for short-distance rural transportation, water conservancy and other construction sites, as well as enterprises and government agencies, should be mated in a timely manner to avoid missed matings and empty pregnancies.

The notice requires all regions to do a good job in protecting pregnancies and assisting in calving for the existing 16 million pregnant livestock nationwide, ensuring that pregnant livestock do not abort and that all offspring survive. People's communes should establish maternity hospitals and young animal breeding farms to provide good feeding and management conditions for pregnant animals and offspring.

The notice concluded by pointing out that all regions should earnestly strengthen leadership over the spring mating and breeding campaign, and organize several mating peaks in the spring. Conduct large-scale appraisals and inspections, mating once and inspecting once, and female animals that have not been successfully mated should be remated in a timely manner.

    农业部通知
    组织几次大牲畜春配高潮
    新华社3日讯　农业部最近发出通知要求各地抓紧春季关键季节，立即动员起来，开展一个大规模的大牲畜配种繁殖运动，力争我国的大牲畜在今年有个大的发展。
    通知指出，大牲畜怀孕期长，牛需要九个月，马、驴更长，而且一般都是一胎一仔，因此，要争取大牲畜大发展，必须加强春配工作。
    通知说，1959年多数地区和公社大牲畜的增殖情况已经开始好转，有少数地区和公社发展得很好。但是，就全国范围来讲，大牲畜仍然是畜牧业最薄弱的一环，1960年必须实现大牲畜的大发展。迅速做好配种准备工作。这些工作包括：拟定配种计划下达到生产队，并采取两定（定人、定畜）两包（包配、包准）办法，落实到饲养室，对母畜加强饲养管理，促其及早发情，对种公畜加草加料，增强配种能力；采取就地选择优良种畜为主，组织地区间、公社间、余缺调剂的办法，解决种畜不足困难；社社、队队建立配种站，大力开展人工授精工作，培训配种技术员，及时解决人工授精器材问题。
    通知认为，在配种方式上，各地应采取分批配、牵种公畜下田配、清早配、夜间配等多种办法，克服配种和使役的矛盾。母畜过于分散的，在配种旺季，应适当集中。各地用于农村短途运输、水利等工地，以及企业机关单位的母畜，都应及时配种，不使漏配空怀。
    通知要求各地做好全国现有的一千六百万头孕畜的保胎、接产工作，使孕畜不流产，仔畜全成活。各人民公社应该建立母畜产院和幼畜培育场，对孕畜和仔畜给以良好的饲养管理条件。
    通知最后指出，各地应切实加强对春季配种繁殖运动的领导，在春季组织几次配种高潮。开展大评比，大检查，配一遍，查一遍，没有配准的母畜，要及时再配。
