In the Vistula River Delta
By our reporter Li Ke

    Fighting for Land with the Sea

    We spent the whole day driving through the Vistula River Delta, an area the locals call Żuławy. Before we set off, Comrade Biestka, the Minister of Agriculture of the Polish United Workers' Party's Gdańsk Provincial Committee, proudly told us: "In the Żuławy region, you will witness firsthand how human power has triumphed over nature." Indeed, after touring the delta at the mouth of the Vistula River, anyone would be amazed at the great things that the hands of the people can accomplish. High and wide seawalls hold back the turbulent waters of the Baltic Sea. From a high point, one can see the shimmering sails on the sea, with the depths shrouded in a layer of mist. But on this side of the seawall, in a place below sea level, lies an endless expanse of fertile land.

    The Vistula River Delta is a large depression, two to three meters below sea level. Unlike other river deltas formed by silt deposition, it was mainly reclaimed from the sea by human effort. As early as the fifteenth century, the diligent and intelligent local people gradually built a 530-kilometer-long seawall, separating the Żuławy region from the sea. At the same time, they built dikes along both banks of the Vistula River, drained the seawater, and diverted river water to irrigate the fields. The total length of the water diversion and drainage channels built in the area exceeds the length of the Earth's equator. As a result, the Vistula River Delta became known throughout Europe as a fertile area very early on.

    At the end of World War II, the German fascists breached the seawalls and river dikes, and the Żuławy region became a vast swamp. Villages, roads, and irrigation and drainage ditches were all submerged. The Hitler bandits had arrogantly declared that it would be impossible for the Poles to restore it within fifty years. However, the local residents were not intimidated by the difficulties. In 1946, they heroically began to restore the area, determined to reclaim it from the sea. Comrade Pugashevsky, a hydraulic engineer who has been working here since the beginning of the restoration, described the situation at the time to us: "We had many difficulties then. There was a shortage of manpower, no tools, and no electricity. Ninety-nine thousand hectares of the 130,000 hectares of land in the Żuławy region were submerged, with about 100 million cubic meters of accumulated water. But our determination to restore and rebuild this area was not shaken by the enormous difficulties we faced. Without machines, we used our hands; without electricity, we relied on manpower. First, we blocked the breaches, and then we drained the water." Then, he pointed to the field in front of us and said, "You see, after overcoming all kinds of difficulties and working hard day and night for three or four years, we finally restored and rebuilt it."

    A Land of Water Networks

    Walking into the Żuławy region is like entering a water network formation. The area is crisscrossed with ditches and rivers, with flowing water, and ponds and weirs scattered everywhere. The water of the Vistula River flows from a high position along the dense irrigation canals, across the fields, and across the pastures, nourishing the boundless land. Now, the total length of the irrigation main canals excavated and built by the farmers is 3,000 kilometers. If the large and small canals are connected, the total length is more than 17,000 kilometers. There is an irrigation canal every short distance on the field, and the water in the canal flows all year round. Due to the infiltration of water, the field between the channels always maintains a certain humidity, so there is no need to release water to irrigate the field. The water in the irrigation canal finally flows into the drainage ditch, and is re-discharged into the Vistula River through the pumping station.

    Maintaining the dikes and dredging the channels is an arduous task, and the farmers have to pay a lot of labor every year. We saw state farm workers and agricultural group farmers widening and digging channels, and many people were using ditching machines. According to the farmers, a machine can replace fifty to sixty people.

    In addition to the irrigation canal system, there is also a complete modern drainage system. Because Żuławy is two or three meters below sea level, the water flowing from the Vistula River into the irrigation canal cannot be discharged. In addition, rainwater and infiltrated groundwater often make many areas into lakes. Engineer Pugashevsky, who accompanied us on the visit, often pointed to his feet and reminded us: "After every rain, the water here can be over your head." In order to quickly drain the accumulated water, 130 powerful pumping stations have been built throughout the Żuławy area, pumping water day and night. We specifically visited two pumping stations. Each station has two or more pumps. One pumping station has a pump with a diameter of more than two meters, which can pump 700 cubic meters of water per second. Each pumping station is automated, and only one person per shift is required to manage it.

    Here, the action of water completely obeys the command of people, and people are the masters who have conquered this area.

    A Fertile Land

    Thanks to the establishment of a complete drainage and irrigation system, the Vistula River Delta has become the most fertile place in the country without fear of drought or flooding. The yield per unit area here is more than twice the national average. Currently, the yield of grain per hectare here can reach 40 quintals, while the national average yield of grain per hectare is only 15 quintals. The yield of sugar beet and oil crops in the Żuławy region is also particularly high. The water and grass here are luxuriant, and it is also an excellent pasture. During our visit, we saw herds of cattle and horses leisurely strolling on the grassland, and flocks of ducks and geese playing in the ponds and rivers. The output of meat and milk per 100 hectares of land in the Żuławy region is also higher than in general areas of the country.

    The nearly 100,000 people living here are not satisfied with the existing achievements. They want to build it more beautiful and richer with their own labor. Thousands of farmers are building fish ponds and artificial lakes to turn the water town into a land of fish and rice. Trees are being planted throughout the region. Last year alone, hundreds of thousands of poplars and fruit trees were planted. In a few years, the poplar trees lining the roads and the cherry orchards and apple orchards all over the area will decorate this land even more beautifully with their green leaves,鮮flowers and rich fruits.

    在维斯杜拉河三角洲
    本报记者　李克
    与海争田
    我们整日乘汽车穿行在当地人称之为茹拉瓦地区的维斯杜拉河三角洲上。当我们出发之前，波兰统一工人党革但斯克省委农业部长别斯特卡就自豪地向我们说：“在茹拉瓦地区，你们会亲眼看到人力如何战胜了自然。”的确，在维斯杜拉河入海口的三角洲上周游一遭之后，任何人都要惊叹，人民的双手可以做出多么伟大的事情。高大宽阔的海堤挡住了波涛汹涌的波罗底海的海水，登高可以望见海上的波光帆影，海上深处像笼罩着一层烟雾；而在海堤的这一边，在低于海平面的地方，则是一望无际的沃野。
    维斯杜拉河三角洲是一块大洼地，它比海平面要低两三米，和所有其他河流三角洲靠淤积形成的原因不同，它主要是用人力向海洋夺取的。远从十五世纪开始，当地勤劳智慧的人民就利用地势陆续培修了一条全长五百三十公里的海堤，把茹拉瓦地区和大海隔离开来，同时沿维斯杜拉河两岸修了河堤，抽干了海水，引河水灌溉田地。全区修筑的引水排水渠道的总长度超过了地球赤道的长度。因此，维斯杜拉河三角洲很早就成了知名全欧的肥沃地带。
    第二次世界大战结束时，德国法西斯掘开了海堤河堤，茹拉瓦地区顿成一片泽国。村落、道路、排灌沟渠全部淹没。希特勒匪徒们曾狂妄地宣称：波兰人在五十年内无法把它恢复起来。可是当地居民并没有被困难吓倒，1946年他们就以英雄的气概动手恢复这一地区，要把它从海水手里重新夺过来。陪我们参观的水利工程师普加谢夫斯基同志从恢复一开始就在这里工作，他向我们描述当时的情景说：“那时我们困难很多，人力少，没有工具，也没有电力，茹拉瓦地区十三万公顷土地中有九万九千公顷泡在水里，积水约有一亿立方米。可是我们要把这块地区恢复重建的决心并没有因面临的巨大困难而动摇。没有机器我们用手，没有电力就用人力，首先堵塞了决口，然后就是排水。”接着，他指着面前的田地说：“你看，度过了种种难关，夜以继日地苦干了三四年，我们到底把它恢复重建了起来。”
    水网地带
    走进茹拉瓦地区，就像进了水网阵，全区到处沟渠河道纵横交错，水流淙淙，池塘堰坝星罗棋布，维斯杜拉河水居高临下，沿着密如蛛网的灌溉渠流过田野，流过牧场，滋润着无边的土地。现在，农民挖掘修建成的灌溉总渠的长度加起来有三千公里，如果把大小渠道接连起来，总长有一万七千多公里。田地上隔不远就有一道灌溉渠，渠里终年有水流动，由于水的浸润作用，渠道之间的田地永远保持着一定的湿度，所以这里无须放水浇田。灌溉渠里的水最后流入排水沟，经过抽水机站重新排入维斯杜拉河。
    维修堤防和疏浚渠道是一项繁重的工作，农民们每年都要付出大量劳动。我们看见国营农场的职工和农业小组的农民正在加宽和挖渠道，不少人使用着挖沟的机器，据农民们说，一部机器可以代替五十人到六十人工作。
    这里除了灌溉渠道系统之外，还有一套完善的现代化的排水系统，因为茹拉瓦比海平面要低两三米，从维斯杜拉河流入灌溉渠的水无法渲泄，再加雨水和渗透出来的地下水，常使许多地区成为湖泊。陪我们参观的普加谢夫斯基工程师就常常指着脚下提醒我们说：“每逢雨后，这里水深可以没顶。”为了能把积水迅速排出去，茹拉瓦全区建立了一百三十个强大的抽水机站，昼夜不停地把积水排走。我们特地参观了两座抽水机站，每个站都有两部以上的抽水机，有一个抽水机站的抽水机的直径有两米多，每秒可抽水七百立方米。各抽水机站都是自动化的，每班只需一个人管理。
    在这里，水的动作完全要听从人的命令，人是征服了这块地区的主人。
    一片沃野
    维斯杜拉河三角洲由于建立了完善的排灌系统，不虑天旱水淹，成了全国最肥沃的地方。这里的单位面积产量高出全国平均单位面积产量一倍以上，目前这里每公顷谷物的产量可达四十公担，而全国每公顷谷物的平均产量不过十五公担，茹拉瓦地区的甜菜、油料作物的产量也特别高。这里水草茂盛，还是优良的牧场。我们参观时就到处看到成群的牛马在草地上悠闲地漫步，看到鸭群鹅群在池塘和河边戏水。茹拉瓦地区每一百公顷土地上的肉类和牛奶的产量也高过全国一般地区。
    住在这里的近十万人民并没有以现有的成就为满足，他们要用自己的劳动把它建设得更美丽更富饶。成千的农民在修建养鱼池和人工湖，要把水乡变成鱼米之乡。全区都在种树，仅去年就种了几十万株白杨和果树，几年后，夹道的白杨和遍布全区的樱桃园、苹果园，将用它们的绿叶鲜花和丰盛的果实把这块土地装饰得更加美丽。（附图片）
