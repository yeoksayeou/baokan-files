Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 4th: For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have toiled, bending their backs to transplant rice seedlings. In the first spring of the 1960s, this labor will be largely replaced by various types of rice transplanters made using both indigenous and foreign methods. Initially created in 1956, rice transplanters have been continuously improved and refined over the years. Following large-scale production trials last year, they have now reached the stage of large-scale promotion and use. This is a significant step towards the mechanization of agriculture in our country.

Currently, throughout the country, especially in the southern rice-growing regions, a vigorous upsurge in the promotion and use of rice transplanters is underway, taking advantage of the favorable spring weather. In southern provinces and regions such as Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and northern provinces and regions such as Jilin and Ningxia, Party committees at all levels have recently assigned special personnel or established specialized organizations to strengthen leadership in the manufacturing, promotion, and training of rice transplanter operators. In Hunan Province, leading groups or headquarters for the promotion of rice transplanters have been established from the provincial level down to the county (city) level. Counties and cities are using methods such as convening on-site meetings and holding training classes to train more than 76,000 iron and woodworking craftsmen who can manufacture rice transplanters. As of February 20th, the province had manufactured 160,000 rice transplanters, and many more can be produced before the early rice transplanting season, striving to implement machine transplanting for more than 30% of the province's early rice. At present, commune members in various places are braving the cold to go to the fields, using pine needles instead of seedlings, and practicing operating techniques intensively. Guizhou Province, which had the largest area of rice transplanted using rice transplanters last year, is continuing to exert great effort this year, striving to increase the number of rice transplanters promoted from nearly 70,000 last year to 250,000. Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangsu, and other provinces and regions, which promoted less in previous years, are catching up rapidly, vigorously tackling ideological, manufacturing, and usage challenges. Party committee secretaries at all levels are personally taking action, convening on-site meetings or organizing technical demonstration teams to deeply disseminate rice transplanter manufacturing and usage techniques and benefits. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has specially organized teams of iron and woodworking craftsmen to manufacture rice transplanters professionally and train them at all levels to ensure the quality of the rice transplanters. Northern provinces such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning are also rapidly getting started by adopting methods such as "learning from experience" from other provinces.

The use of rice transplanters for transplanting rice, based on production practices over the past few years, especially the larger-scale production in 1959, has fully demonstrated the advantages of high work efficiency, good quality, increased production, and reduced labor intensity. In more than 20 counties and cities in Guizhou Province, such as Tongren and Xiuwen, over 380,000 mu of rice were transplanted last year using the Liling No. 2 simple rice transplanter, saving more than 600,000 man-days compared to manual transplanting, an average saving of nearly two man-days per mu. Due to the use of rice transplanters, labor intensity was reduced, allowing women and semi-able-bodied laborers to fully play their role in the demanding and technically challenging task of transplanting rice, further alleviating the labor shortage during the rush harvest of early rice and the rush transplanting of late rice. At the same time, because machine transplanting is more uniform, neater, and consistent in depth than manual transplanting, with a higher qualification rate, it also achieved increased production compared to manual transplanting. According to investigations, the 36,000 mu of rice transplanted by machine in Jiangxi Province last year generally increased production by 6.5% to 15% compared to manual transplanting. The situation in other regions is roughly the same. Therefore, the broad masses of people's commune members warmly welcome rice transplanters. Farmers in Meitan County, Guizhou, expressed their joy in using rice transplanters in mountain songs: "Since ancient times, manual transplanting has been considered skillful, but now machines fly in the fields, ensuring quality and quantity with high efficiency, no more sore backs or aching legs. At first glance, it's like a dragon playing in the water, and in the blink of an eye, a green veil is woven."

The large-scale promotion and use of rice transplanters this year is the result of the continuous creation, improvement, and enhancement of rice transplanters by the broad masses and agricultural scientific workers under the leadership of the Party, giving full play to the spirit of daring to think and daring to act over the past few years. Our country's work on the creation and experimentation of rice transplanters began as early as 1956. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, in the vigorous tool reform movement, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses of workers and peasants who dared to think and dared to act also threw themselves into the ranks of creating rice transplanters with infinite wisdom. They combined with professional scientific research teams to rapidly advance the creation and experimentation of rice transplanters. According to incomplete statistics, to date, more than 90 types of rice transplanters that have been created and modified to a relatively mature level have been achieved in various places. Among them, seven types have been identified and decided to be promoted after national professional conference appraisals and finalizations. They are the Liling No. 2 Type A rice transplanter, the Jiangxi-59 type rice transplanter, the Guangxi 59-3 type rice transplanter, the Hanchuan 59-23 type rice transplanter, the Shanghai Nanhui No. 1 rice transplanter, the Nan 105-B type rice transplanter, and the Zhejiang Agricultural No. 4 rice transplanter. These rice transplanters are both indigenous and foreign, as well as semi-indigenous and semi-foreign. They all have the characteristics of high work efficiency, good quality, and convenient use. Moreover, most are simple to manufacture, and general counties and communes can use local materials to process and manufacture them. The main rice transplanters promoted and used in various places this year are these seven types. In addition, some regions have also selected other types of rice transplanters suitable for local use based on technical conditions and manufacturing capabilities for manufacturing and promotion.

The new task after the full-scale promotion and use of rice transplanters is: how to realize the tool serialization of the entire rice transplanting process, including seedling cultivation, seedling pulling, seedling washing, and seedling transportation, to adapt to the needs of improving the work efficiency of rice transplanters, and to achieve mechanization more comprehensively and deeply. In this regard, relevant departments have already begun research, striving to create a complete set of semi-mechanized high-efficiency tools for the entire rice transplanting process before the late rice transplanting this year to solve this problem. In addition, on the basis of promoting existing rice transplanters, various regions will continue to study and experiment with the use of power machinery to pull rice transplanters, creating conditions for the realization of rice transplanting mechanization and automation.

Relevant parties pointed out: After a large number of rice transplanters are promoted, there is no doubt that their advantages will be brought into play on a large scale. However, it must be estimated that all types of rice transplanters still have certain shortcomings. In addition, due to the rush in manufacturing, technical proficiency is lacking, and some products that do not meet the required standards will naturally appear. Furthermore, if rice transplanter operators are not skilled enough, the phenomenon of poor transplanting will inevitably occur, and some may be slower and worse than manual transplanting. These problems must be taken into account, and there must be unwavering confidence. If problems arise, there should be no regrets or retreat. We must forge ahead and we will certainly be victorious.

    全国大规模推广插秧机
    各地在推广中，信心百倍，深入解决技术问题，让插秧机彻底代替笨重的手工操作
    新华社广州4日电　我国农民千百年来弯腰曲背的水稻插秧劳动，在六十年代的第一个春天，将要大面积地被土法制造和洋法制造的各种型号的插秧机代替。在1956年初步创制成功的插秧机，经过几年来的不断改进提高，特别是经过去年的大面积生产试验，目前已发展到大规模推广使用的阶段。这是我国农业迈向机械化的重要的一步。
    现在，全国各地，特别是南方水稻地区，正趁大好春光，掀起一个轰轰烈烈、推广使用插秧机的高潮。南方湖南、贵州、四川、广东、广西，和北方吉林、宁夏等省、区，各级党委最近都抽调专人或成立专门机构，对插秧机的制造、推广和培训插秧机手等工作加强了领导。湖南省从省到县（市）都成立了插秧机推广领导小组或指挥部，各县、市用召开现场会议和举办训练班的方法，培训出能制造插秧机的铁木工人七万六千多人，到2月20日止，全省已制造出插秧机十六万部，早稻插秧前还可造成很多，可争取全省30％以上的早稻实行机插。目前各地公社社员正冒寒下田，以松毛代秧苗，大练特练操作技术。去年使用插秧机插秧面积占全国第一位的贵州省，今年继续鼓足干劲，争取把插秧机的推广部数由去年的将近七万部增加到二十五万部。往年推广较少的四川、广西、广东、湖北、江苏等省、区，正急起直追，猛攻思想、制造、使用关。各级党委书记亲自出动，召开现场会议或组织技术表演队，深入传播插秧机制造、使用技术和好处。广西僮族自治区为保证插秧机的质量，特地组织铁木匠专业制造插秧机队伍，层层训练。北方地区的吉林、黑龙江、辽宁等省也正采取向外省“取经”等办法迅速上马。
    使用水稻插秧机插秧，经过过去几年特别是1959年较大面积的生产实践，完全证明具有工效高、质量好、能增产和减轻劳动强度的优越性。贵州省铜仁、修文等二十多个县市，去年用醴陵二号简易插秧机栽插水稻三十八万多亩，比手插共节省人工六十多万个，平均每亩节省将近两个工；由于使用插秧机插秧，能减轻劳动强度，使妇女、半劳动力在插秧这个劳动强度大、技术要求高的农活上，也充分发挥了作用，进一步减轻了抢收早稻和抢插晚稻期间劳力紧张的程度。同时，由于机插比手插均匀、整齐，深浅一致，合格率高，因此，还获得了比手插增产的效果。据调查，江西省去年机插的三万六千亩水稻，一般比手插增产6．5％到15％。其他地区的情况大致相同。因此，广大人民公社社员热烈欢迎插秧机，贵州湄潭县农民用山歌唱出了他们使用插秧机的喜悦：“自古插秧手称能，如今机器田中飞，保质保量效率高，腰不酸来腿不疼，初看好似龙戏水，转眼青纱已织成”。
    今年各地能够大规模地推广使用插秧机，是过去几年广大群众和农业科学工作人员，在党的领导下，发挥敢想敢干的精神，对插秧机不断创制、改进和提高的结果。我国对插秧机的创制、试验工作，早在1956年就开始了。从1958年大跃进以来，在轰轰烈烈的工具改革运动中，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，敢想敢干的广大工农群众，也以无穷的智慧投入了创制插秧机的行列，他们和科学研究专业队伍相结合，把插秧机的创制和试验迅速地推向前进。据不完全统计，到目前为止，各地创制、改制比较成熟的插秧机已达九十多种。其中，经过全国性的专业会议鉴定定型决定推广的已有七种。它们是醴陵二号甲型插秧机、江西——五九型插秧机、广西五九——三型插秧机、汉川五九——二三型插秧机、上海南汇一号插秧机、南一零五——B型插秧机和浙农四号插秧机。这批插秧机有土有洋，也有半土半洋的，都具有工效高、质量好、使用方便的特点，而且多数制造简单，一般县、社都可以就地取材，加工制造。今年各地推广使用的主要就是这七种插秧机。另外，有些地区，还根据技术条件、制造能力，选择了适合当地使用的其他型号的插秧机，进行制造推广。
    全面推广使用插秧机后的新课题是：如何实现育秧、拔秧、洗秧、运秧等整个插秧过程的工具系列化，以便适应插秧机提高工效的需要，和更全面更深入地实现机械化。对此，有关部门已经着手进行研究，力争在今年晚稻插秧以前，创造出一整套整个插秧过程使用的半机械化高工效工具，以解决这个问题。此外，各地在推广现有插秧机的基础上，还将继续研究试验使用动力机械牵引插秧机插秧，为实现水稻插秧机械化和自动化创造条件。
    有关方面指出：大量推广插秧机之后，无疑义会在大面积上发挥它的优越性。但是，必须估计到，所有各种型号的插秧机，都还存在着一定的缺点。加上在赶制中，技术不熟练，自然出现一些不合规格要求的。再加上插秧机操作手技术不熟练，插不好的现象必然会出现，有些比手插还要慢，还要差。这些毛病必须估计到，必须有坚定的信心，出了毛病不后悔，不退缩，勇往直前，一定能够胜利的。
