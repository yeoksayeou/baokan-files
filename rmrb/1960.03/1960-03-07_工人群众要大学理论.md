    Worker Masses Need University Theory
    Li Wen
    A new upsurge of worker masses studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is now forming throughout the country. This is a major event in the ideological life of our working class, and further promoting this study movement is a very important task.
    Regarding the theory of Marxism-Leninism, should workers study it? Do they need to study it? Can they study it? Our answer is affirmative. Marxism has already solved this problem theoretically, and practical life has also answered this problem.
    Theory originally arises from practical struggle; only with the practice of production struggle can there be natural science, and only with the practice of class struggle can there be social science. Marxist theory is a product of the workers' movement. It summarizes the history of human production struggle and class struggle, reflects the fundamental interests of the working class, and points out a path for the thorough emancipation of the working people. The working class participates directly in production struggle, and it is the most advanced and most revolutionary class. From their position, they are the most suited, the most in need, and the most capable of understanding Marxist theory. When Marx and Engels jointly created Marxist theory, they did so for the working class. After Marxist theory came out, it was immediately enthusiastically welcomed by the working class. Marx wrote in the postscript to the second edition of "Das Kapital": "The understanding that 'Das Kapital' rapidly gained in wide circles of the German working class is the best wage for my labor." Marxism-Leninism has class character; only by standing on the position of the working class can it be truly grasped.
    The facts in our country also prove this point. The trend of worker masses learning theory flourished during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and this was not accidental. In 1957, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on us, and the first to refute them were the worker masses. The worker masses had the strongest reactions and most passionate emotions towards the rightists' anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party put forward the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." The worker masses were full of energy, feeling the glory of being the leading class and also the importance of the leading class's responsibility. The worker masses wanted to go all out to overfulfill production tasks, realize the Great Leap Forward, participate in production management, implement technological innovation, and so on. These objective needs made them feel that they must improve themselves. They realized that they must study theory, study Marxism-Leninism, and study Chairman Mao's works in order to grasp the objective laws in practical work, fully develop their subjective initiative, and learn the ability to manage the country. In particular, Chairman Mao's proposal to promote the communist style of "daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do" greatly enlightened them and helped them eliminate the mystery of theory. In this way, the worker masses' learning theory formed a high tide in 1958. The result of learning theory was the improvement of workers' political consciousness and professional skills. Last year, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the call to further develop the movement to increase production and practice economy. In order to combat right-leaning tendencies and encourage enthusiasm, the worker masses felt the need to further study theory and further arm their minds. Therefore, a new upsurge in studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works has formed. The results of this study movement have already been significant. Production continues to leap forward, and thinking continues to improve. Many workers have also written very good study notes and papers. For example, the philosophy self-study group of the No. 7 Department Store in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, has achieved great results in less than two years since its establishment in May 1958. This self-study group has produced many labor models and red-banner pacesetters, advanced workers, and an excellent study model and labor model, Wei Shuqin. Some members of this study group initially felt that their education level was low, afraid of not understanding, and thought that Marxist theory was too profound and unattainable. The members of the group discussed whether to study theory and whether they could study theory. The conclusion was that they must study and they certainly could study. Sure enough, they studied diligently, persisted unremittingly, and learned very well. Their service attitude was greatly improved, and their professional skills were also greatly improved, achieving integration of being both red and expert. This is just one example, and there are many such good models across the country. Therefore, the idea that workers are "roughnecks" who cannot learn theory is completely wrong.
    The number of workers learning theory across the country is unprecedented. This study should be seen as a popularization movement of Marxism-Leninism. The purpose of the study is to raise communist consciousness, improve understanding, and improve work. Of course, popularization and improvement cannot be separated, and improvement should also be carried out on the basis of popularization. At present, the worker masses have adopted a learning method that combines theory and practice, using the "arrow" of theory to shoot the "target" of practice, which is correct. The reason why the worker masses urgently feel the need to study theory is due to the demands of practical struggle (production struggle, class struggle), due to contradictions that need to be resolved, and after they have learned theory, they use it to solve problems in practical struggle.
    It can be expected that with the development of the movement of worker masses studying theory, the communist ideological consciousness of the worker masses will continue to greatly improve, and new and great achievements will be made in work and production.

    工人群众要大学理论
    理文
    工人群众学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，现在已经在全国各地形成了一个新的高潮，这是我国工人阶级思想生活中的一件大事，进一步推动这个学习运动，是一项十分重要的任务。
    对于马克思列宁主义的理论，工人应该不应该学？需要不需要学？能够不能够学？我们的回答是肯定的。马克思主义早已从理论上解决了这个问题，实际生活也已经回答了这个问题。
    理论本来是从实际斗争中产生的；有了生产斗争的实践，才有自然科学，有了阶级斗争的实践，才有社会科学。马克思主义的理论是工人运动的产物，它总结了人类进行生产斗争和阶级斗争的历史，反映了工人阶级的根本利益，为劳动人民的彻底解放指出了一条道路。工人阶级是亲身参加生产斗争的，他们又是最先进最有革命性的阶级，从他们所处的地位来看，他们是最应该，最需要，也最能够领会马克思主义的理论的。马克思和恩格斯在共同创立马克思主义理论时，本来也就是为工人阶级的。马克思主义的理论出来以后，马上就受到工人阶级的热烈欢呼。马克思在“资本论”第二版跋中写道：“资本论迅速在德意志工人阶级广大范围内得到的理解，对于我的劳动，是最好的工资。”马克思列宁主义是有阶级性的，只有站在工人阶级的立场上，才能真正掌握它。
    我国的事实也正是证明了这一点。工人群众学理论之风，是在1958年大跃进中大兴起来的，这不是偶然的。1957年资产阶级右派对我们发动了猖狂的进攻，首先出来驳斥他们的是工人群众。工人群众对右派的反党反社会主义的谬论，反应最强烈，情绪最激昂。1958年大跃进中，党提出了“两参一改三结合”的方针，工人群众干劲冲天，他们感到做领导阶级的光荣，也感到做领导阶级责任的重大。工人群众要千方百计超额完成生产任务，实现大跃进，要参加管理生产，要实行技术革新，等等，这些客观需要使他们感到必须提高自己。他们认识到，必须学习理论，学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，才能掌握实际工作中的客观规律性，充分发扬主观能动性，才能使自己学会管理国家的本领。特别是毛主席提出要发扬“敢想敢说敢做”的共产主义风格，大大地启发了他们，帮助他们破除了对理论的神秘感。这样，工人群众学理论就在1958年形成了高潮。学理论的结果是提高了工人的政治觉悟和业务能力。去年党的八届八中全会提出了进一步开展增产节约运动的号召，为了反右倾、鼓干劲，工人群众觉得有进一步学习理论，进一步武装自己的头脑的必要。因此形成了学习毛泽东同志的著作的新高潮。这个学习运动成绩已经很显著。生产继续跃进，思想不断提高。有不少工人还写出了很好的学习心得和论文。例如黑龙江省哈尔滨市第七百货商店有一个哲学自学小组，从1958年5月成立到现在，不到两年，已经获得了很大的成绩。这个自学小组里出了不少劳动模范和红旗手、先进工作者，还出了一个优秀的学习模范兼劳动模范魏淑琴。这个学习小组的有些成员最初也觉得自己文化低，害怕学不懂，认为马克思主义理论太深奥，高不可攀。小组的成员讨论了要不要学理论？能不能学理论？结论是一定要学，一定能学。果然，他们刻苦钻研，坚持不懈，学得很好，服务态度大大改进了，业务能力也大大提高了，做到了红专结合。这只是一个例子，全国像这样的好的典型还很多。所以，那种认为工人是“大老粗”，学不了理论的思想是完全错误的。
    现在全国各地学习理论的工人数目之多是空前的，应该把这个学习看成是马克思列宁主义的普及运动。学习的目的，是提高共产主义觉悟，提高认识，改进工作。当然，普及和提高是不能分开的，在普及的基础上也要提高。目前工人群众都采取了理论和实际结合的学习方法，用理论之“矢”来射实际之“的”，这是对的。工人群众之所以迫切感到需要学习理论，是由于实际斗争（生产斗争、阶级斗争）提出的要求，是由于有矛盾需要解决，而他们学习了理论以后，就用来解决实际斗争中的问题。
    可以预期，随着工人群众学习理论的运动的开展，工人群众的共产主义思想觉悟将继续大大提高，在工作上和生产上将会取得新的巨大的成绩。
