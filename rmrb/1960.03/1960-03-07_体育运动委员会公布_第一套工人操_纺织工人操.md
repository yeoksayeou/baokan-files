Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission today announced the first set of workers' exercises: Textile Workers' Exercises.

These exercises are designed based on the characteristics of textile workers’ labor production, where upper and lower limb activities are more frequent and prone to causing localized fatigue, as well as the physiological characteristics of women. The entire set of exercises is divided into eight sections, including stretching, squatting, leg kicks, lateral flexion, back extension, body rotation, full body movement, and relaxation exercises. Among them, there are more trunk activities, so that the muscles and joints that are not or less active in labor production can also be activated by doing workers' exercises.

The amount of exercise in this set is moderate, taking about four minutes to complete once. The movements are simple and relatively graceful, making it very suitable for textile workers to exercise before and after labor or during production breaks. Regularly doing this set of workers' exercises will have a very good effect on enhancing physical fitness and improving labor productivity.

This set of exercises was compiled by the State Sports Commission in conjunction with relevant departments after multiple studies and discussions, and after experimentation among textile workers. The action diagrams of the entire set of exercises will be published in newspapers and magazines such as Workers' Daily, China Youth Daily, Sports News, New Sports, and Textile Workers. The music for this set of textile workers' exercises is also being prepared.

    体育运动委员会公布
    第一套工人操——纺织工人操
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国体育运动委员会今天公布了第一套工人操——纺织工人操。
    这套体操是根据纺织工人在劳动生产中上肢和下肢活动较多，容易引起局部疲劳的特点，和根据妇女的生理特征而编制的。全套操共分八节，包括伸展、下蹲、踢腿、体侧屈、体后屈、体转、全身和放松运动。其中躯干活动较多，能使在劳动生产中没有或较少活动的肌肉和关节，通过做工人操也得到活动。
    这套操运动量适中，作一遍约需四分多钟，动作简单而且比较优美，很适合纺织工人在劳动前后或生产间隙进行锻炼。经常做这套工人操，对增强体质和提高劳动生产率，将会起很好的作用。
    这套体操是由国家体委会同有关部门经过多次研究、讨论，并在纺织工人中实验后编制出来的。全套体操的动作图解将在工人日报、中国青年报、体育报和新体育、纺织工人等报刊上登载，这套纺织工人操的乐曲也正在配制中。
