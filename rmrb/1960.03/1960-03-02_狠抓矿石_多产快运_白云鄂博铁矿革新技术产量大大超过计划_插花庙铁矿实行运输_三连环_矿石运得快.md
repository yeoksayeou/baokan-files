Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 30th -- Following the spirit of "look at the second step after taking the first" and "sooner rather than later," the Baiyun Obo Iron Mine of Baogang had already completed 84% of its first-quarter plan by February 27th.

This iron mine, from the very beginning of this year, has been grasping and grasping firmly, based on the current excellent situation. The workers are determined to be pioneers in steel production. After achieving a "full house" in production in January, they immediately put forward the slogan of "Surpass January in February." The actual iron ore output completed in February has increased by 23% compared to the plan issued by the head office, which is eleven times that of the same period last year.

At the beginning of this year, while assigning tasks to the workers, the iron mine's Party committee mobilized them to launch a large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution around five key issues: large ore size, drilling efficiency, electric shovel loading efficiency, transportation, and mechanical maintenance and repair. The workers of the main mine workshop, in their "breakthrough," experimented with and promoted the new method of using large drilling machine drill bits on small drilling machines for drilling holes, which increased drilling efficiency by 15%. Subsequently, they successfully experimented with electric arc gouging, creating conditions for overcoming the large ore size challenge. In order to ensure that the output of ore fully meets the needs of electric shovel loading and transportation, the East Mine workshop, led by the Party branch secretary, with cadres participating in labor, strengthened the maintenance of drilling machines, improved mechanical utilization, and completed the February drilling plan ahead of schedule on the 18th.

This newspaper reports that the Chahuamiao Iron Mine of the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant in Hunan, adapting to local conditions, using simple and crude methods, relying on its own efforts, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, has adopted self-made techniques. It uses a double-line circulating automatic ore unloading system and a "three-link" system of cableway conveyors, native winches, and light railways to form a complete in-mine transportation system, which speeds up ore transport, realizes reduced manpower, increased production, high work efficiency, and low cost.

Previously, this mine had more than fifty single-line simple cableways. Under normal circumstances, each shift could only transport about eight tons of ore sand, and the daily transport volume was only about 150 tons. Now, using only a small number of double-line circulating automatic ore unloading cableways, it can transport more than 1,500 tons per day, which is more than twenty-five times higher in work efficiency than single-line simple cableways. Each single-line simple cableway requires ten to sixteen people to operate, with all ore loading and unloading done manually. After adopting the double-line circulating automatic ore unloading cableway, each cableway only requires four to six people to operate, and it can automatically unload ore, and some can even automatically load ore.

The double-line circulating automatic ore unloading cableway device is simple and can save a large amount of raw materials for manufacturing equipment. The use of this type of double-line circulating automatic ore unloading cableway in the entire mine can save a total of more than 400,000 yuan per year in raw material consumption costs and wages.

### 狠抓矿石　多产快运  白云鄂博铁矿革新技术产量大大超过计划  插花庙铁矿实行运输“三连环”矿石运得快

    狠抓矿石　多产快运
    白云鄂博铁矿革新技术产量大大超过计划
    插花庙铁矿实行运输“三连环”矿石运得快
    新华社包头30日电　包钢白云鄂博铁矿本着走第一步看第二步和赶早不赶晚的精神，到2月27日已经完成第一季度计划的84％。
    这个铁矿今年一开始就根据当前大好形势，紧抓、狠抓，职工们决心当好钢铁生产的先行官。他们在实现了1月份生产满堂红以后，紧接着就提出了2月超1月的口号。2月份实际已经完成的铁矿石产量，比总公司下达的计划提高了23％，等于去年同期的十一倍。
    今年年初，铁矿党委在向职工交代任务的同时，就发动职工围绕大块、穿孔效率、电铲装车效率、运输、机械维护检修等五个关键问题，大闹技术革新和技术革命。主矿车间的职工在“攻关”中，试验推广了在小穿孔机上使用大穿孔机钻具钻眼的新方法，使钻眼效率提高15％。接着，他们又试验成功电弧凿眼法，为攻下大块关创造了条件。东矿车间为了使矿石产量充分满足电铲装运需要，由党总支书记挂帅，干部参加劳动，加强穿孔机的维护工作，提高机械利用率，使2月份的穿孔计划在18日就提前完成。
    本报讯　湖南涟源钢铁厂插花庙铁矿，因地制宜，因陋就简，自力更生，采取土法上马，土洋结合的办法，利用双线循环自动卸矿和索道运输机与土卷扬机、轻便铁轨三连环，组成了完整的矿内运输系统，加快了矿石运输速度，实现了减人增产、高工效、低成本。
    这个矿原先架设有五十多条单线简易索道，在正常情况时，每班也只能溜运八吨左右矿砂，一天的运量不过一百五十吨左右。现在只使用少数双线循环自动卸矿索道，每日就可以运一千五百多吨，比单线简易索道提高工效二十五倍以上。单线简易索道每条要十到十六人操作，装矿卸矿全用人力。采用双线循环自动卸矿索道后，每条只要四人到六人操作，并能自动卸矿，有的还能自动装矿。
    双线循环自动卸矿索道装置简单，能够大量节约制造设备的原料材料。全矿使用这种双线循环自动卸矿索道，每年可以节约原料材料损耗费用和工资等费用共四十多万元。
