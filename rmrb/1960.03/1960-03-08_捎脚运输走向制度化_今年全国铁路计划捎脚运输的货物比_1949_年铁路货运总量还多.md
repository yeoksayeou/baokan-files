Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The by-product transportation created by Chinese railway workers during the Great Leap Forward has seen new developments this year. Currently, the daily by-product transportation volume of the national railway has increased from more than 150,000 tons at the beginning of the year to over 280,000 tons. The by-product transportation volume in January and February is almost equal to 60% of the total by-product transportation volume of the entire last year. The transported goods have expanded from commercial goods to grain, mineral building materials, and steel. The regions implementing by-product transportation have also expanded from some railway bureaus to the entire national railway system, from relatively short-distance by-product transportation within the jurisdiction of one railway bureau to long-distance, inter-bureau by-product transportation between various railway bureaus. This rapidly growing new thing, by-product transportation, is developing into one of the important transportation methods in China's railways, standing shoulder to shoulder with traditional full carload and less-than-carload transportation, complementing each other.

Currently, the main forms of by-product transportation in the railway sector are: using returning empty vehicles to carry goods; using the remaining tonnage of loaded vehicles to carry goods; and using cabooses, locomotives, passenger cars, baggage cars, and other vehicles to carry goods. Practice in various regions has proven that this is a good way to utilize returning empty vehicles, tap transportation potential, and accelerate the circulation of materials. This year, the Ministry of Railways decided to vigorously develop by-product transportation as an important measure to complete the railway freight plan. The national railway plans to transport 65 million tons of goods by by-product transportation, a figure that is 9.9 million tons more than the total national railway freight volume in 1949. Workers in more than 20 railway bureaus across the country have launched a by-product transportation competition since February.

Recently, railway workers in various regions have created many new experiences in by-product transportation, and these experiences are promoting the development of by-product transportation towards planning, organization, and institutionalization.

The sign of by-product transportation moving towards planning is that various railway bureaus have incorporated by-product transportation into their monthly, ten-day, and daily transportation operation plans, making it an integral part of the transportation plan. When studying the transportation operation plan for each ten-day period, the Nanchang Railway Bureau must study and determine the source of goods for by-product transportation, and then determine the number of vehicles and train numbers for by-product transportation according to the quantity of goods to be transported. Because by-product transportation is incorporated into the transportation operation plan, many materials in Jiangxi Province that could not be transported before, such as the limestone in Xiazhen along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the iron ore in Shangrao, and the moso bamboo in Yiyang, have been promptly carried away by returning empty freight cars, supporting industrial and agricultural production.

The "one-dragon" by-product transportation experience created by workers in units such as the Linfen Railway Office and the Fengtai Train Section has made by-product transportation more organized. Their experience is: within the railway system, with the dispatching department as the center, organize the station and the train conductors of the trains carrying by-product goods to cooperate with each other; at the same time, the railway department cooperates with the production, handling, and sales departments to do a good job in every work in the entire process from formulating the plan, loading the car, to the arrival of the goods at the destination warehouse. The Ministry of Railways is promoting this experience, and in some areas, railway and commercial departments have jointly established "one-dragon" by-product transportation offices.

In order to institutionalize by-product transportation, the Ministry of Railways has formulated a set of by-product transportation methods, which are being implemented on the national railways; railway departments in Shanghai, Nanchang, Hangzhou and other places have also specially set up by-product transportation dispatchers. After the Hangzhou Railway Bureau set up such dispatchers, the daily by-product transportation volume doubled.

### 捎脚运输走向制度化  今年全国铁路计划捎脚运输的货物比1949年铁路货运总量还多

    捎脚运输走向制度化
    今年全国铁路计划捎脚运输的货物比1949年铁路货运总量还多
    新华社7日讯　我国铁路职工在大跃进中创造的捎脚运输今年以来又有新的发展。目前全国铁路每天的捎脚运输量，已经由年初的十五万多吨提高到二十八万吨以上，1、2月份的捎脚运输量几乎等于去年全年捎脚运输总量的60％；捎运的货物已经由商业物资发展到粮食、矿物性建筑材料和钢材等；实行捎脚运输的地区，也由原来的部分铁路局扩展到全国铁路部门，由原来一个铁路局管辖以内比较近距离的捎运，发展为各铁路局之间的长距离的跨局捎运。捎脚运输这个迅速成长起来的新生事物，正在发展成为我国铁路的重要运输方式之一，它同历来的整车、零担运输平起平坐，相辅而行。
    目前铁路部门捎脚运输的主要形式是：利用回空车辆捎货；利用载重车辆剩余的吨位捎货；利用守车、机车、客车、行李车等车辆捎货。各地实践证明，这是利用回空车辆和挖掘运输潜力、加速物资流转的好办法。今年，铁道部决定把大力开展捎脚运输作为完成铁路货运计划的一条重要措施。全国铁路计划捎脚运输六千五百万吨货物，这个数字比1949年全国铁路货运总量还多九百万吨。全国二十多个铁路局的职工，从2月份起展开了捎脚运输竞赛。
    最近，各地铁路职工在捎脚运输中又创造了许多新的经验，这些经验正推动着捎脚运输朝向计划化、组织化、制度化的方向发展。
    捎脚运输走向计划化的标志是，各铁路局把捎脚运输纳入了月、旬、日的运输作业方案，使它成为运输计划的一个组成部分。南昌铁路局在研究每旬的运输作业方案时，都要研究和确定捎脚运输的货源，然后根据捎运物资的数量，确定捎运的车数和车次。由于把捎脚运输纳入了运输作业方案，使江西省许多以前无法运出的物资，如浙赣铁路沿线下镇的石灰石，上饶的铁矿石，弋阳的毛竹等，都及时利用回空货车捎走了，支援了工农业生产。
    临汾铁路办事处和丰台列车段等单位职工创造的“一条龙”捎脚运输经验，使捎脚运输走向了组织化。他们的经验是：在铁路内部，以调度部门为中心，把车站和捎运货物的列车车长组织起来，互相配合；同时，由铁路部门和生产、搬运、销售部门协作配合，做好从制定计划、装车到货物运达目的地仓库全部过程中的每一工作。铁道部正在推广这个经验，有些地区的铁路和商业部门已经联合建立了“一条龙”捎脚运输办公室。
    为了使捎脚运输制度化，铁道部已经制订了一套捎脚运输办法，在全国铁路实行；上海、南昌、杭州等地铁路部门，还专门设置了捎脚运输调度员。杭州铁路局设置这样的调度员后，每天捎运量增加了一倍左右。
