    Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, Continually Enriches Experience in Political and Ideological Work
    Establishes a Complete Socialist Education Network
    (Reported by this newspaper) In the continued Great Leap Forward movement of 1959, the CCP Yuncheng County Committee developed the "Three-Three-One-Two" political and ideological work network.  "Three Schools and One Station" were established in the communes, and "One Group and Six Members" were established in the production teams.  Organizations were established at all levels, from the commune down to the district and team, and points were set up everywhere, forming a complete socialist and communist education network. Enormous political work was carried out, and a comprehensive Great Leap Forward was achieved.
    The "Three-Three-One-Two" system was created by the Sanluli Party Branch in the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958 (i.e., carrying out political and ideological work through three schools—Party school, Communist Youth League school, and commune members' Red and Expert school; three days—Party Day, Communist Youth League Day, and Three-Love and Three-Diligence Day; one club; and two rooms—library and exhibition room). Last year, the county party committee persisted in this political and ideological work network and promoted it throughout the county, carrying out a large-scale socialist and communist education movement, greatly strengthening the Party's political and ideological work and implementing the mass line. Especially after publicizing and implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of people were even more enthusiastic, high-spirited, and in high spirits, and a new high tide of leap forward quickly appeared. A brilliant achievement was obtained in the overall Great Leap Forward with industrial and agricultural production as the center: the county-run industry overfulfilled the annual output value plan ahead of schedule by 46 days with 0.14%; the county's 820,000 mu of wheat achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 205 jin per mu, an increase of 19.6% compared with 1958; although cotton suffered from a rare severe drought in a century, it also achieved a large-scale high-yield bumper harvest, with 470,000 mu of cotton fields, of which 93,427 mu yielded 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, 71,000 mu yielded more than 100 jin, 21,248 mu yielded 150 jin, 11,618 mu yielded more than 200 jin, and 188 mu reached 1,000 jin of seed cotton.
    The achievements of the Great Leap Forward are the result of repeated struggles against conservative ideas. Last spring, when the county party committee proposed: mobilize all positive factors, exert greater efforts, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, some people with conservative ideas believed that the conditions were not good and that production had reached its peak. For this reason, the county party committee convened a meeting of 10,000 people, printed 35,000 copies of nine typical materials on continuous bumper harvests and progressively increasing yields, and organized 100,000 propaganda troops to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda, so that the broad masses of people realized that "whether there is a bumper harvest or not depends entirely on ideological redness." The masses also cited specific facts: The Jiacun Management District of the Jiezhou Commune is full of saline-alkali land. In 1957, a revolution in soil was carried out, resulting in a bumper harvest of 53 jin of ginned cotton per mu. An old farmer said: "This is the first time he has seen it in his life, it's really amazing." Immediately afterwards, a spring plowing upsurge centered on wheat field management swept the county. In just a few days, more than 7 billion jin of fertilizer were accumulated and produced, and topdressing was applied to 130,000 mu of third-class fields, and spring watering and harrowing were carried out. The old conservative ideas were reversed, and new conservative ideas came again. During spring sowing and summer planting, some cadres and masses believed that cotton could not be densely planted. In response to the above situation, in addition to conducting in-depth investigation and research on key points, the county party committee also held several forums of "native and foreign experts" attended by old farmers, labor models, and technical cadres, conducted careful research and discussion, formulated a "Plan on the Degree of Dense Planting of Cotton and Corn," and used the county newspaper and wired broadcasting for systematic publicity and reporting; at the same time, the county party committee also convened a propaganda meeting of more than 500 people, printed 120,000 copies of propaganda materials, and organized 115,000 propaganda troops to launch a profound discussion among the people, reversing the conservative ideas of some cadres and farmers, and correctly implementing the eight-character constitution for agriculture. Cadres and the masses generally reflected: "Political education has been greatly strengthened, the results of propaganda are truly brilliant, ideological production has achieved a double victory, and the Party's policies are shining brightly." Through this series of struggles on the ideological front, they fully boosted their energy and strengthened their confidence in continuing the leap forward. Therefore, the broad masses of cadres and people showed a heroic spirit in the face of the rare severe drought in the late summer and early autumn of last year. In this series of struggles, the county party committee learned a lesson: only by holding high the red flag of the general line and repelling the conservative ideas that began to emerge time and time again can we adhere to the Great Leap Forward and move forward bravely.
    Regularly conducting ideological investigations, understanding the masses' thoughts, and ensuring that the leadership is clear-headed and prescribing the right medicine is a prerequisite for doing a good job in political and ideological work. Whenever a movement or central task arrives, the county party committee dispatches a certain amount of manpower to deeply understand the ideological situation of the broad masses of people at all levels in several different types of areas (management area or production team, group) that are relatively advanced, relatively backward, and intermediate, and then take effective measures to carry out propaganda in light of the actual situation. From last spring to now, 13 ideological investigations have been conducted. In addition to strengthening ideological investigation at the county level, all communes insisted on implementing the system of holding a special party committee meeting once a month to study propaganda work and ideological trends inside and outside the party. From the ideological investigation, the county party committee realized that not only should ideological investigation be grasped during major changes, but also during peacetime; not only should it be grasped during difficult times, but also during smooth times; not only should advanced ideas be grasped, but also backward ideas; not only should advanced units and regions be grasped, but also backward units and regions.
    Vigorously promote and develop the "Three-Three-One-Two" political and ideological work system, closely combining this system with large-scale shock movement, so that political and ideological work can not only form a vigorous mass movement, but also be solid, in-depth and meticulous. The "Three-Three-One-Two" is a set of mature experiences, and the county party committee has consistently adhered to it and promoted it throughout the county. In order to create experience and continuously develop while adhering to the system, when conveying the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the county party committee sent working groups to the Sanluli Management District of the Shangguo Commune and the Kao Lao Commune to provide key assistance, creating commune-level "Three Schools" (Party School, League School, Red and Expert School or Art School), "One Station" (theoretical, cultural and educational, propaganda, literary and art teaching reporting station, some called guidance station) and the production team's "One Group and Six Members" (propaganda group is equipped with a newspaper reader, broadcaster, compiler, blackboard newspaper member, reading administrator, singing instructor). The "Three Schools and One Station" lead the "Three-Three-One-Two" of various management areas, and the "One Group and Six Members" carry out extensive, small-scale and diverse propaganda activities. In this way, a socialist education network has been formed from the commune, management area to the production team. Another new development of "Three-Three-One-Two" is that it has moved from fixed position activities to the fields, construction sites, canteens, factories and mines, and to all corners, so it has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in all battlefields of large-scale cooperation and large-scale corps operations and all collective places, giving full play to its great power. It has truly achieved that production and education are not delayed, and that production and ideology both reap bumper harvests.
    In the movement to strengthen political and ideological work, carry out mass cultural and artistic activities, and promote a comprehensive leap forward in work, Yuncheng County has cultivated a contingent of Marxist-Leninist propaganda, and this contingent has more than 15,000 theoretical, cultural and educational, and other literary and artistic propaganda backbones. In order to strengthen the training of this contingent and enable them to continuously improve their level, in addition to concentrating them for short-term training before each movement, the party organizations of the communes or management areas also systematically organized them to study at the county party school and the commune party school according to plan. In addition, the county party committee and the commune party committee also printed and distributed 1 million copies of propaganda materials and teaching materials to them this year. This enables them to always maintain a clear head.

    山西运城县不断丰富政治思想工作经验
    建立了一套完整的社会主义教育网
    本报讯　中共山西运城县委在1959年继续大跃进运动中，发展了“三三一二”的政治思想工作网。在公社建立“三校一站”，生产队建立“一组六员”，上至公社，下至区、队，层层建组织，处处都设点，形成了一套完整的社会主义和共产主义教育网，进行了巨大的政治工作，获得了全面大跃进。
      “三三一二”是该县三路里党支部在1958年大跃进运动中创造出来的（即通过三校——党校、团校、社员红专学校；三日——党日、团日和三爱三勤日；一部——俱乐部；二室——图书室、展览室进行政治思想工作。）。去年，县委把这套政治思想工作网一直坚持下来并推广到全县，进行了规模巨大的社会主义与共产主义教育运动，大大加强了党的政治思想工作，贯彻了群众路线。特别是宣传贯彻了党的八届八中全会的决议以后，广大群众更是干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，意气风发，很快出现了一个新的跃进高潮。以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进获得了辉煌的成果：县营工业超额0．14％提前四十六天完成了全年产值计划；全县八十二万亩小麦获得了大丰收，平均亩产达二百零五斤，比1958年提高了19．6％；棉花虽然遭受百年不遇的特大旱灾，但是也获得了大面积的高额丰产，四十七万亩棉田，其中亩产皮棉八十斤的有九万三千四百二十七亩，百斤以上的七万一千亩，一百五十斤的二万一千二百四十八亩，二百斤以上的一万一千六百一十八亩，达到千斤籽棉的一百八十八亩。
    大跃进的成就，是与保守思想进行反复斗争的结果。去年春季，当县委提出：调动一切积极因素，鼓足更大干劲，实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进时，一部分抱有保守思想的人，认为条件不好，生产到顶了。为此，县委召开了万人大会，印刷了九种三万五千份连年丰收、节节高产的典型材料，组织了十万宣传大军进行广泛、深入的宣传，使广大群众认识到“丰收不丰收，全在思想红”。群众还举出了具体事实：解州公社贾村管理区尽是盐碱滩地，1957年大闹土壤革命，争得了亩产皮棉五十三斤的大丰收，老农说：“这是他一辈子头一次见到，真了不起”。紧接着，一个以麦田管理为中心的春耕热潮，席卷全县。只有短短几天时间，就积肥、造肥七十多亿斤，给十三万亩三类田普施了追肥，并且进行了春浇和耙耱。旧的保守思想反掉了，新的保守思想又来了。在春播和夏种的时候，部分干部和群众认为棉花不能密植。针对上述情况，县委除深入重点进行调查研究外，还多次召开了老农、劳动模范和技术干部参加的“土洋专家”座谈会，进行了缜密的研究讨论，制定了“关于棉花、玉茭密植程度方案”，利用县报和有线广播进行了系统的宣传报道；与此同时，县委还召开了五百余人的宣传会议，印刷了十二万份宣传品，组织了十一万五千人的宣传大军，在全民中展开了一场深刻的讨论，扭转了部分干部和农民中的保守思想，正确的贯彻了农业八字宪法。干部和群众普遍反映：“政治教育大大加强，宣传战果真辉煌，思想生产双胜利，党的政策放光芒”。通过思想战线上的这一系列的斗争，全面鼓足了干劲，坚定了继续跃进的信心。因此，广大干部与群众在去年夏末秋初百年不遇的特大旱灾面前，表现了一种英雄气概。在这一系列的斗争中，县委学到了一条经验，就是只有高举总路线红旗，一次又一次地击退了开始露头的保守思想，才能坚持大跃进，勇猛向前。
    定期进行思想考察，摸透群众思想，作到领导头脑清醒，对症下药，这是做好政治思想工作的一个前提。每当一个什么运动或者中心工作到来之前，县委都要抽派一定力量，深入比较先进的、比较落后的和中间的几种不同类型地区（管理区或生产队、组）深入了解各阶层广大群众的思想情况，然后针对实际情况，采取得力措施，开展宣传。从去年春天到现在，共进行了十三次思想考察。除县上加强了思想考察以外，各公社都坚持执行了每月一次党委会议专门研究一次宣传工作和党内外思想动向的制度。从思想考察中，县委体会到不仅大变动时期要抓思想考察，而且平时也要抓；不仅困难时候抓，而且顺利时候也要抓；不仅要抓先进的思想，而且也抓落后的思想；不仅抓先进单位和地区，而且要抓落后的单位和地区。
    大力推广与发展“三三一二”的政治思想工作制度，把这种制度和大搞突击运动紧密的结合起来，既使政治思想工作形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，又能使它扎扎实实，深入细致地持续下来。“三三一二”是一套成熟的经验，县委把它一直坚持下来，推广到全县。为了在坚持制度的同时，创造经验，不断发展，在传达党的八届六中全会的时候，县委就派出工作组到上郭公社的三路里管理区和考老公社进行重点帮助，创造了公社级的“三校”（党校、团校、红专校或艺校），“一站”（理论、文教、宣传、文艺传授报告站，有的叫指导站）和生产队的“一组六员”（宣传组设有读报员、广播员、编写员、板报员、读书管理员、教唱员）。通过“三校一站”领导各管理区的“三三一二”，用“一组六员”开展广泛的小型多样的宣传活动。这样就从公社、管理区直到生产队形成了一套社会主义教育网。“三三一二”的另一个新发展，就是由固定的阵地活动，搬到了田间、工地、食堂和厂矿，搬到了各个角落，于是它就在大协作、大兵团作战的各个战场和所有的集体场所，都生了根、开了花、结了果，发挥了巨大的威力。真正做到了生产教育两不误，生产思想双丰收。
    在加强政治思想工作，大搞群众性的文化艺术活动，推动全面工作大跃进的运动中，运城县已经培养了一批马克思列宁主义的宣传队伍，这支队伍仅理论、文教和其它文艺宣传骨干就有一万五千多人。为了对这支队伍加强培养，使他们的水平能够不断提高，公社或管理区党组织除在每次运动前，把他们集中起来进行短时期训练外，还有计划的组织他们到县委党校和公社党校进行了系统的学习。此外，县委和公社党委在今年还给他们印发了一百万份宣传资料和教材。这就使他们始终保持了清醒的头脑。
