Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 18th: The Soviet government today gifted a Mi-4 helicopter, along with its parts, accessories, and medical equipment, which was exhibited at the Soviet exhibition held here, to the Cuban government.

	While presenting these gifts to Castro, Vasily Merkulov, head of the Soviet trade delegation, conveyed "the boundless admiration of the Soviet people for the heroic Cuban people." He said that the Soviet government, having learned of the "La Coubre" tragedy, decided to donate this medical equipment to help alleviate the suffering of the victims.

	Castro, on behalf of the revolutionary government, thanked the Soviet Union for the gifts and condemned the United States' refusal yesterday to sell helicopters to Cuba as "an act of aggression by one country against our progress and economic liberation." Castro emphasized that the helicopters gifted by the Soviet Union, as well as those previously purchased from the United States, were only used for the peaceful work of land reform and not for war purposes, as the United States claimed as a pretext for refusing to sell the aircraft. He said that the United States had sold ten helicopters to Cuba, but later refused to sell Cuba helicopter parts, which was an international fraud.

	Also participating in the gift-giving ceremony were Núñez Jiménez, Director of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform of Cuba, and Soviet experts in Havana. These experts will explain all matters related to the donated items to Cuban technicians.

    苏联赠古巴直升飞机
    卡斯特罗谴责美国拒售飞机
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　苏联政府今天把它在这儿举行的苏联展览会上展出的一架米—4直升飞机及其零件、配件和医疗器材赠送给古巴政府。
    在向卡斯特罗致送这些礼品时，苏联贸易代表团团长瓦西里·麦尔库洛夫转达了“苏联人民对英勇的古巴人民的无限钦佩的心情”。他说，苏联政府获悉“勒库布尔号”惨剧后，决定捐献这些医疗器材，以便有助于减轻受难者的苦痛。
    卡斯特罗代表革命政府感谢苏联赠送的礼物，并且谴责美国昨天拒绝卖给古巴直升飞机是“一个国家反对我国进步和经济解放的侵略行动”。卡斯特罗强调指出，苏联赠送的直升飞机和以前向美国买来的直升飞机都只用于土地改革的和平工作，而不是像美国拒绝出售飞机的借口所说的那样是为了战争的目的。他说，美国曾经卖给了古巴十架直升飞机，但是后来拒绝卖给古巴直升飞机的配件，这是国际骗局。
    参加赠礼仪式的还有古巴土地改革全国委员会主任努涅斯·希门尼斯和在哈瓦那的苏联专家。这些专家们将向古巴技术人员讲解有关赠送的这些物品的一切问题。
