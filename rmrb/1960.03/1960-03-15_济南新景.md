    New Scenes of Jinan
  　Ge Zhenying
    Jinan is one of China's famous historical cities. The earliest records of Jinan can be found in the Spring and Autumn period: "In the eighteenth year of Duke Huan, in the spring, the king's first month, the Duke met with the Marquis of Qi at Luo." Luo is present-day Jinan, formerly known as Lixia. In the early Han Dynasty, Emperor Wen enfeoffed this place to Bi Guang, the son of Prince Daohui, and named it the Kingdom of Jinan, because this place was located south of the Ji River.
    The mountains and rivers of Jinan are very famous. Daming Lake, Thousand Buddha Mountain, and Baotu Spring are collectively known as the three major scenic spots. In addition, there are seventy-two famous springs such as Jin Line and Pearl, and more than twenty famous mountains such as Golden Bull and Phoenix.
    Daming Lake is not large, covering only a thousand acres. However, the lake and mountain scenery is very beautiful, and it is simple and elegant, with a unique flavor. Tang poets Du Fu, Li Bai, Li Yong, Gao Shi, and others gathered at Lixia Pavilion in the heart of the lake to compose poems. Du Fu's poem "Accompanying Li Beihai at the Banquet at Lixia Pavilion" contains the lines "This ancient pavilion is to the east of the sea, and there are many famous scholars in Jinan," which were later inscribed on the vermilion door frame of Lixia Pavilion by Qing Dynasty calligrapher He Shaoji.
    Thousand Buddha Mountain was formerly known as Mount Li. Legend has it that "Shun cultivated Mount Li" is the current Thousand Buddha Mountain. Therefore, it is also known as Shun耕 Mountain. At the foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain, south of Jinan City, there is Shun Well, also known as Shun Spring, which is also one of the seventy-two famous springs.
    Jinan's scenic spots are most loved for its springs. Baotu Spring ranks first among the seventy-two famous springs and is the main source of the Xiaoqing River. The spring water gushes out from the ground, clear and transparent, pure and sweet. When Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty went south, he passed through Jinan and used this spring water as a beverage, and named it the "First Spring under Heaven." Now, this beautiful spring water has become the public property of the working people and is enjoyed by the working people.
    The historical city of Jinan has experienced countless disasters before liberation. Warlords such as Zhang Zongchang and Han Fuju had all occupied this place. The "May 3rd" Massacre even witnessed a large-scale slaughter by Japanese invaders. Under the long-term dark rule of the puppet regime and the Kuomintang, Jinan had completely become a semi-feudal and semi-colonial consumer city, and the famous historical sites were also in decline and desolation. Daming Lake had not been dredged for a long time, sewage accumulated, mosquitoes and flies bred, and epidemics were prevalent among the residents along the lake. The temples and Buddha statues on Thousand Buddha Mountain had also collapsed and eroded, and were in a dilapidated state. The trees on the mountain had been completely cut down. As for the famous springs such as Baotu and Jin Line, many were occupied by bureaucrats and compradors as private gardens.
    The narrowness of the roads in old Jinan was also very famous. For example, Yuandong Street, Yuanxi Street, and Puli Street were originally the most prosperous areas of Jinan City. However, the average road width was less than seven meters. If cars traveling in opposite directions wanted to pass each other, they had to slow down to almost a snail's pace. As for the pedestrians on both sides, they had to stand facing the wall at this moment. Therefore, traffic accidents occurred frequently, directly endangering people's lives.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Jinan are carrying out large-scale construction at an amazing speed. It is changing year by year, day by day, and moment by moment. Taking the construction of roads as an example, in the past ten years, a total of 379 kilometers of various roads have been built. The newly paved roads are longer than the total length of all roads in the city before liberation by 59 kilometers. The original Yuanxi Yuandong Street and the newly opened Communist Youth League Road have been combined into an east-west trunk line. The road surface is straight and the width is 25 meters, which is a complete change from the past.
    The southeast suburbs of Jinan are the newly built cultural district. Since liberation, basic construction has been carried out in this area almost every day. Now, more than a dozen tall and magnificent buildings have been erected here. Cultural and educational institutions such as the Normal College, the Institute of Technology, the Institute of Physical Education, the Art School, the Finance and Economics College, and the Film Studio are all concentrated in this area. Other institutions such as Shandong University and Shandong Medical College are also located not far from here. It is no exaggeration to say that the equipment, teachers, experts, and students concentrated in this small area are far more than all of Shandong had before liberation.
    Compared with the southeast suburbs, the changes in the northwest suburbs are even greater. Originally, there were only a few dilapidated factories and a few scattered chimneys here. Now, it is filled with dozens of newly built and expanded factories, and countless huge chimneys soar into the sky. Jinan is no longer a consumer city, but has been built into a production city with modern equipment and huge production capacity.
    Before liberation, Jinan could only produce white cotton cloth, gray cotton cloth, red and blue cotton cloth, and native silk. Now it can produce more than a hundred kinds of printed cloth, colored cloth, woolen cloth, and silk. In 1958, the total output of the textile industry increased by more than five times compared with the highest annual output before liberation (1936).
    Before liberation, Jinan—no, it should be said that the entire China—had never produced a modern machine. But now, in Jinan city alone, the diesel engines and gantry planers produced have been sold overseas and exhibited at industrial exhibitions in Leipzig, India, Japan, and other countries, and have won extremely high international reputation. A self-designed, electrically controlled universal combined gantry planer has been successfully trial-produced and has been sent to the Beijing Industrial Exhibition Hall with red silk hanging on it. This planer is precisely designed and has extremely high technical level, and can be compared with the best planers of the same type in the world.
    The automobile manufacturing industry is still a young industry in New China. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of Jinan City, with the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, established their own automobile industry. The first Yellow River brand automobile was born before the "May 1st" Labor Day in 1958. The achievements of the people of Jinan are great. Before liberation, Jinan, or even Shandong, can be said to have had no iron and steel industry at all. Real iron and steel production only began after the Great Leap Forward. Through large-scale iron and steel production, from scratch, from small to large, from small indigenous groups to small foreign groups and large foreign groups, a solid foundation was laid for Jinan's iron and steel industry.
    With the changes in the entire face of Jinan, Jinan's mountains and rivers and scenic spots also fully show their splendor. The old city along the lake on the east, west, and north sides of Daming Lake has been demolished, leveled, and greened. The lake water has also become flowing water, making the original stinky water very fragrant and pleasant. The sewage discharged from the lake contains a lot of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other components. Irrigating with this water has increased the yield of vegetables such as spinach and tomatoes in the suburbs by as much as ten times. The Lixia, Nanfeng, Beiji, and Tie Gong Pavilions have all been renovated.
    Baotu Spring Park has also been renovated and expanded, and the park area has been expanded by more than twenty times. Baixue Tower, where the Ming Dynasty scholar Li Cangming lectured, stands at the entrance of the park. Jin Line, Ma Pao, Shuyu, and Liuxu Springs have all been incorporated into the park. According to legend, Shuyu Spring was the former residence of the Song Dynasty female poet Li Qingzhao, and the spring was named after the "Shuyu Collection". Now, the park is planted with flowers and trees, and ponds and canals are dug, and the appearance is completely new.
    The Great Leap Forward that began in 1958 added another scenic spot to Jinan's famous scenic spots. This scenic spot is even more dazzling than the other scenic spots. In the past, the northern suburbs were known for the fragrance of lotus flowers for ten miles, but now they are known for the fragrance of rice for a hundred miles. This is the location of the Beiyuan People's Commune, which was visited by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. Beiyuan rice is full of grains and has a very high yield. Since the establishment of the commune, especially after Chairman Mao's visit, the members have been building their beautiful pastoral homes with soaring enthusiasm. Now the Beiyuan People's Commune, together with the people's communes across the country, is leaping towards the goal of greater prosperity.

    济南新景
  　戈振缨
    济南是我国历史名城之一。有关济南的记载，最早见于春秋：桓公“十有八年，春，王正月，公会齐侯于泺”。泺，就是现在的济南。古称历下。至汉初，文帝以此地封与悼惠王之子辟光，命名为济南国。因为这个地方处在济水之南的缘故。
    济南山水，是十分著名的。大明湖、千佛山、趵突泉合称三大名胜，此外，还有金线、珍珠等七十二名泉，金牛、凤凰等二十余名山。
    大明湖并不大，占地不过千亩。但，湖光山色，十分秀丽，并且朴素、淡雅，别具风味。唐诗人杜甫、李白、李邕、高适等曾于湖心历下亭宴集赋诗。杜甫所作的“陪李北海宴历下亭”诗中，有“海右此亭古，济南名士多”两句，后曾由清代书法家何绍基书写，镌刻在历下亭的朱红门框上。
    千佛山古称历山。传说“舜耕历山”就是现在的千佛山。因此，又名舜耕山。千佛山下，济城南关，有舜井，又名舜泉，也是七十二名泉之一。
    济南名胜最为人喜爱的还是它的泉水。趵突泉居七十二名泉之首，是小清河的主要发源地。泉水自地下喷涌而出，清澈透明，清纯甘美。清乾隆皇帝南下时，路经济南，就以此泉水为饮料，并封为天下第一泉。现在，这美好的泉水，已成为劳动人民的公共财产，为劳动人民所享用了。
    历史名城济南，解放前，经历过无数灾难。张宗昌、韩复渠等土匪军阀，都曾在此盘据过。“五三”惨案，更曾经过日寇的大屠杀。而在敌伪和国民党的长期黑暗统治下，济南已经完全沦为半封建半殖民地的消费城市，名胜古迹也败落荒芜了。大明湖因为久不疏浚，污水汇集，蚊蝇孳生，沿湖居民，疫疠流行。千佛山的庙宇、佛像，也倒塌剥蚀，残破不堪。山上树木，被砍伐一光。至于趵突、金线诸名泉，也多被官僚、买办占为私人花园。
    旧济南，道路的狭窄，也是十分著名的。比如院东、院西大街和普利大街，原是济南市最繁华的地带。但，路宽平均却不到七米，对头汽车要想错车，必须将速度放慢到几近于乌龟爬行的程度。至于两边行人，此刻便只好面壁而立了。因此，交通事故经常发生，直接危害人们的生命安全。
    解放后，济南人民在党的领导下，以惊人的速度，进行着规模巨大的建设。它是年年在变，天天在变，时刻在变。即以修筑的道路而言，十年来，共修筑各种道路长达三百七十九公里。新增铺的道路，其长度比解放前全市道路长度的总和还多五十九公里。原来的院西院东大街和新辟的共青团路，合筑成一条东西干线，路面平直，宽度为二十五米，较之过去已完全改观了。
    济南东南郊是新建的文化区。解放以来，这个地区几乎每天都在进行基本建设。现在，这里已经矗立着十数处高大宏丽的建筑物。如师范学院、工学院、体育学院、艺术专科学校、财经学院、电影制片厂等等文化教育机构，都集中在这个地区。其他如山东大学、山东医学院，也都设在与此相距不远的地方。可以毫不夸张地说，这个小小的地区所集中的大专院校的设备、师资、专家、学生，比之解放前十个山东所有的还要多得多。
    和东南郊比较，西北郊的变化则更大。原来这里只有破破烂烂几座工厂，疏疏落落的几支烟囱。现在，这里却布满了新建、扩建的几十座工厂，无数支巨大的烟囱高插云空。济南不再是一个消费城市，已经建设成为一个具有现代化设备的、生产能力巨大的生产城市了。
    解放前，济南只能生产白细布、灰细布、红、蓝细布和土茧绸。现在却能够生产上百种以上花布、色布、线呢、丝绸。1958年纺织工业总产量较解放前最高年产量（1936年）增长了五倍以上。
    解放前，济南——不，应该说整个中国，都不曾生产过一台现代化的机器。而现在，仅仅济南一市，生产的柴油机、龙门刨，就已经远销国外，并在来比锡、印度、日本等工业展览会上展出过，获得极高的国际声誉。一台自行设计的、用电力控制的万能联合龙门刨床又试制成功了，并已经披采挂红送进了北京工业展览馆。这台刨床，设计精密，技术水平极高，可以与世界同类机器中最优秀的刨床媲美。
    汽车制造工业，在新中国来说，也还是一项年轻的工业。在1958年大跃进的高潮中，济南市的工人们，在党的领导之下，以敢想敢干的精神，建立了自己的汽车工业。第一辆黄河牌汽车，在1958年“五一”节前诞生了。济南人民的成就是伟大的。解放前，济南，甚至山东，可以说根本没有钢铁工业。真正的钢铁生产，还是从大跃进以后才开始的。通过大办钢铁，从无到有，从小到大，从小土群到小洋群，大洋群，就这样给济南的钢铁工业打下强固的基础。
    随着济南整个面貌的变化，济南的山水名胜也充分显示出自己的丰采。大明湖东、西、北，沿湖的旧城已经拆除，加以平整、绿化，湖水也变成活水，使得原来那一湾臭水，变得十分清芬宜人。湖里排出的污水，因为含氮、磷、钾等成分很多，引水灌溉，使郊区的菠菜、蕃茄等蔬菜，增产竟达十数倍。历下、南丰、北极、铁公诸亭，也都重加修葺。
    趵突泉公园也已重修扩建，园地扩大二十余倍。明代学者李沧溟讲学的白雪楼，即耸立于公园入口处。金线、马跑、漱玉、柳絮诸泉，也都划入园内。相传，漱玉泉乃宋代女诗人李清照故居，该泉即因漱玉集而得名。现在园内广植花木，挖塘开渠，面貌焕然一新。
    1958年开始的大跃进，使济南名胜又多了一景。这一景较之其余诸景，更加丰采夺目。在过去，以十里荷香知名的北郊，如今更以百里稻香而闻名了。这里就是中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席曾经访问过的北园人民公社所在地。北园大米，颗粒饱满，产量极丰。自公社成立，特别自毛主席访问以后，社员们更以冲天干劲，建设自己美好的田园。现在北园人民公社，和全国各人民公社一起，正向着更加繁荣昌盛的目标跃进。
