    Dedicating Her Heart to Millions of Builders
    ——On Wu Xiuying, a Female Sales Clerk at the Shanghai Daming Department Store
  　Cao Qi
    During the Spring Festival, in a hospital ward, there was a young woman, going from bed to bed, cordially greeting everyone, asking if they needed any more supplies. As soon as the patients saw her, they raised themselves from their beds, enthusiastically calling her "Little Sister," "Good Daughter," "Good Comrade," vying for her to sit by their bedside. Was she a nurse in the hospital? Was she a relative of one of the patients? No, she was Wu Xiuying, a sales clerk at the Daming Department Store. Recently, she told me about the path she had taken:
    Who are they?
    Two years ago, when I first entered the Daming Department Store, I was not at ease with my work, feeling that serving others was inferior. At that time, I was only twenty years old and already had two children, my mind filled with housework and children. However, many things at work deeply touched me. One day, a customer who looked like a worker came to my counter in a hurry and asked me, "Someone like me, what size pants should I buy?" I wasn't sure, so I said, "Why don't you buy a pair and try them on? If they don't fit, come back and exchange them." He looked at me, and said in frustration, "If I had known you would answer me like this, I would have simply gone to a tailor shop to get measured. Don't you know how tense our production is!" Watching the customer leave in disappointment, I felt sad, although I still didn't truly understand the full meaning of my work. But these things made me want to know, what kind of people are these hurried customers? Why do they often make so many requests and ask so many questions of me?
    I began to notice that the people who came to my counter were not ordinary people, but workers, sailors... They were builders who selflessly labored for the happiness of the people, and they told me many things that I will never forget. Those dockworkers pointed to the surrounding stores and proudly told me, "Look, the beautiful enamel basins, the snow-white cotton sweaters, we carry them all, bag after bag! We're also working on quick loading and unloading." Fishermen told me that in order to catch fish for everyone to eat, they often fought stubbornly against the wind and waves on the sea for days and nights. I began to realize how much profound meaning was contained in the phrase "serve the people" that the Party branch secretary kept telling me. My work was not simply buying and selling; I was serving the millions of heroic people who dedicated themselves to the cause of socialism!
    Glorious Commission
    From that moment on, I felt that my work was a glorious commission entrusted to me by these heroic builders. But without the skills, I couldn't fulfill my responsibilities. From that moment on, I tried my best to learn.
    There was an old worker in the store with more than ten years of experience, and he told me many things I had never thought of. He said that when a customer walks from the entrance to your counter, you should be able to estimate how tall he is, how wide his shoulders are, and what colors would suit his complexion. This inspired me to not only study the work inside the counter but also to familiarize myself with all related knowledge. There are cloth shops and tailor shops near our store, and the salespeople eat in the same cafeteria. I ate two bowls of rice, eating the first bowl with an old tailor, asking him: What are the general types of body shapes? How can I cut fabric most economically? ... For the second bowl, I sat with an old man from the cloth shop and asked him about the characteristics of various fabrics and how to maintain them... After work, I went to the cloth shop and tailor shop, standing next to the old men and carefully observing. This way, the knowledge I learned was solid. Usually, I also tried on clothes of various sizes, comparing them to my own figure; visited advanced units... Really, after I mastered this knowledge, as soon as a customer walked up to my counter, I had everything figured out for him. As soon as he stopped, I would show him this and that, explaining everything to him. Sometimes, some customers came to buy clothes for others, and I was not sure about the size, I felt like I was missing something. At night, I would take a few different sizes of clothes and go to the customer's house to measure them again. Only then could I sleep peacefully that night. Once, a very young comrade wanted to buy the smallest size shirt for adults. He was holding a ten-yuan note, wanting to give it to me, but also wanting to put it back in his pocket. Looking at him, I remembered an article I had read in the "Youth Daily": some apprentices are not good at managing their lives, wearing silk scarves around their necks in the cold weather, but barefoot. I asked, and he was indeed an apprentice, because he wanted to buy a shirt and also save money for the bus, afraid that he didn't have enough money. I picked out the largest size shirt for an average person for him and calculated a detailed account for him with the remaining money. Before leaving, he happily called me "Big Sister," saying, "You are really our 'Chief of Staff' for life!" I strongly felt how much trust they placed in the salespeople! I couldn't help but think that this was the greatest happiness in my life.
    For a Common Ideal
    The Spring Festival was approaching, and I got up early in the morning to visit the trade union at the factory, noted down the workers' needs on a list, collected the goods, and set up a stall at the factory during the workers' meal breaks. The worker comrades surrounded me with smiles, and I felt even more that outside my counter, there was a vast world, and there were many selfless builders everywhere who needed my care. I was very busy before the Spring Festival and couldn't get away. On the first day of the New Year, I took the time to go to the hospital. As soon as I entered the ward, the patients happily made various requests to me.... Before leaving, a younger female patient asked me to come to her bedside and said to me, "I have spent my third Spring Festival in the hospital, and my illness is not completely cured. Everyone is leaping forward, but what about me? ... Seeing you serving us like this makes me even more sad." I tried my best to comfort her, hoping that she would recover quickly and return to the ranks of construction. I heard that her mouth was very dry and she wanted to eat apples. What should I do? The next morning, I took my child for a walk on the street to see where I could buy apples. I was so happy, I finally bought apples, more than a pound! I dragged the child and ran to the hospital in one breath. As soon as that female comrade saw me, she hugged me tightly and said excitedly, "Little sister, I really don't know what to say to you! My husband has already brought me apples. You can give these apples to the new patient across the room, she has a high fever and needs them more than I do." I was so moved at that moment that tears flowed down my face. In our society, the relationship between people is so noble, caring for others more than caring for oneself for a common ideal. As a salesperson, I will never stop making my heart redder and dedicating my heart to the millions of heroic people who have dedicated themselves to the cause of socialism.
    Listening to this young person's talk, I felt as if a warm current was slowly flowing through my chest. When a person has a red heart to serve the proletariat, is selfless, and is dedicated to benefiting others, then he can become a true communist fighter. When he uses such a red heart to sincerely serve others, he not only satisfies others materially, but more importantly, the brilliance of his communist ideology and morality also influences others and inspires people to move forward.

    把心献给千千万万建设者
    ——记上海大名百货商店女营业员吴秀英
  　曹琦
    春节，在一家医院的病房里，有一位年轻的女同志，挨着一个个床位走过去，亲切地向每一个人问候，问大家还需要添些什么用品？病人一见了她，都从床上抬起了上身，热烈地叫她“小妹妹”、“好女儿”、“好同志”，争着要她坐到自己的床边上来。她是医院里的护士吗？是哪一个病人的亲人吗？不，她是大名百货商店的营业员吴秀英。最近，她向我叙述了自己所走过的一段道路：
    他们是谁？
    两年前，我刚进大名百货商店的时候，还不安心工作，觉得为别人服务，是低人一等。那时，我还只二十岁，已经有了两个孩子，一脑子的家务事、孩子。但是，工作中有许多事情深深地触动了我。有一天，一个工人模样的顾客，匆匆忙忙来到我的柜台前面，问我：“像我这样的人，买一条裤子要多大的尺寸？”我弄不清楚，就说：“你先买一条试试看，不合身再来调好了。”他看看我，懊恼地说：“要是我早知道你这样回答我，我干脆到裁缝店去量了。你不知道，我们生产有多么紧张！”眼看着顾客失望而去，我心里就难过起来了，虽然这样，我还没有真正懂得我工作的全部意义。但是，这些事情，却使我产生了一种要求，我想要了解，究竟那些来去匆忙的顾客是些什么样的人？他们为什么常常对我提出那么许多要求和问题？
    我开始注意到，到我柜台前面来的，不是普普通通的人，是工人、海员……他们是为了人民幸福而忘我劳动的建设者，他们告诉了我许多使我永远忘不了的事情。那些码头工人，指着四周的商店，自豪地跟我说：“你看，漂亮的搪瓷面盆，雪白的棉毛衫，都是我们一包包背在身上运来的！我们还在搞快装快卸哩。”捕鱼工人告诉我，为了捉鱼给大家吃，他们常常几天几夜，在大海上和风浪顽强搏斗。我开始体会到，党支部书记一直向我说的“为人民服务”这句话，是包含着多少深刻的意义，我的工作，不是简简单单的你买我卖，我是在为那些献身给社会主义事业的千千万万个英雄的人民服务！
    光荣的委托        
    从这时起，我感到：我的工作，就是这些英雄的建设者对我的一种光荣委托。但是，没有本领，就不能尽到责任啊，也就从这时起，我就想尽办法学习。
    店里有位十几年工龄的老工人，他告诉了我许多原来我想不到的经验。他说，一个顾客从大门口走近你柜台的时候，你就应该算好他的身材有多高，肩膀有多宽，他的肤色应该配那些花色。这些，启发了我不但要研究柜台里面的工作，而且要熟悉一切有关的知识。我们店的附近有布店、裁缝店，营业员都在一个食堂里吃饭，我吃两碗饭，第一碗饭就和裁缝店老伯一面吃，一面向他请教：身材大体有几种类型？怎样剪裁最省布？……第二碗饭，我又和布店老伯伯坐在一起，向他请教各种布料的特色，应该怎样保养？……下了班，我再到布店、裁缝店去，站在老伯伯旁边仔细观察，这样，学到的知识就牢固了。平时，我还试穿各种尺寸的衣服，拿自己的身材作比较；访问先进单位……真的，我掌握了这些知识以后，每一个顾客一走近我的柜台，我就什么都给他算好了，他一立定，我就把这件拿给他看看，那件拿给他看看，为他作各种说明。有时候，有些顾客代别人来买衣服，尺寸没有把握，我心里就好像缺了什么似的。晚上，带了几件不同尺寸的衣服，再到顾客家里去量一遍。这样，这个晚上我才能睡得安心。有一次有一个年纪很轻的同志，要买大人穿的尺寸最小的衬衫，他拿着一张十元钞票，想交给我，又想放回自己的口袋。我看着他，想起了从前在“青年报”上看到过的一篇文章：有些艺徒不善于安排生活，大冷天，脖子上围了花绸围巾，下面却赤着脚。我一问，果然是个艺徒，因为他要买件衬衫，还要留车钱，怕钱不够。我为他挑了一件中人穿的尺寸最大的衬衫，还为他把剩下来的钱算了一笔细账。临走，他高兴得叫我“大姐姐”，他说“你真是我们生活上的‘参谋长’！”我强烈地感到，他们对营业员，寄予多么大的信任！我不能不认为，这就是我生活中最大的幸福。
    为了共同的理想
    春节就要到了，我一早就起来，到工厂去访问工会，把工人同志的需要记在单子上，领好货色，等工人吃饭休息的时候，到工厂去摆摊子。工人同志笑嘻嘻地把我围了起来，我就更加觉得：在我的柜台外面，有着一个非常广阔的天地，到处都有许多忘我的建设者，需要我去关心他们。春节前我工作很忙，走不开。初一那天，我抽空到医院去了。一走进病房，病人都高兴地向我提出各种要求……。临走的时候，有一个年纪比较轻的女病人，叫我到她床跟前，跟我说：“我在医院已经过了第三个春节，病还没有全好，大家都在大跃进，而我呢？……看到你这样为我们服务，我心里更加难过了。”我努力安慰她，希望她快点把病治好回到建设的行列中去。我听说她嘴巴很干，想吃苹果，怎么办呢？第二天，一早我就带了我的小孩子在马路上兜，看看哪里能买到苹果。真高兴，苹果终于买到了，一斤多！我拖了孩子，一口气奔到医院，那位女同志一看见我，激动得紧紧抱着我说：“小妹妹，我真不知道跟你说什么好！刚才我爱人已给我带来苹果，这些苹果，你送给对面那位新来的病人吧，她热度高，比我更需要。”我当时也感动得眼泪都流下来了，在我们的社会里，人和人的关系，是这样的崇高，为了共同的理想，关心别人胜于关心自己。作为一个营业员，我将永远不停地把心锻炼得更红，把心献给千千万万献身给社会主义事业的英雄的人民。
    听了这位年轻人的谈话，我好像感到，有一股热流在我的胸中缓缓流过，一个人，当他有了一颗为无产阶级服务的红心，毫不利己，专门利人，那么，他就能够成为一个真正的共产主义战士；当他是用这样一颗红心赤诚地为别人服务，就不但使别人得到物质上的满足，更重要的是，他的共产主义思想和道德所发出的光辉，也影响着别人，激励着人们前进。
