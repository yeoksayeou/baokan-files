    Provide Sufficient Feed for Livestock
    Romania Expands Planting of Silage Corn

    Romania's total number of pigs, cattle, and sheep will increase by 6.5% this year compared to last year, and the planting area for silage corn used as feed will more than double compared to last year. Last year, the total number of pigs, cattle, and sheep increased by 5% compared to 1958.

    This year, in order to rapidly develop animal husbandry, the Romanian Workers' Party and the government have taken many measures, the most important of which is promoting a large increase in the planting area of silage corn. According to experimental results, using silage corn as feed can greatly increase milk production and reduce the production cost of milk. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to plant 250,000 hectares of silage corn this year (an increase of 136% compared to 1959), and will expand it to one million hectares in the next few years.

    为牲畜提供充分饲料
    罗扩种青贮玉蜀黍
    罗马尼亚的猪牛羊的总头数今年将比去年增加6．5％，用作饲料的青贮玉蜀黍的播种面积将比去年扩大一倍多。去年，猪牛羊的总头数比1958年增加了5％。
    今年，为了迅速发展畜牧业，罗马尼亚工人党和政府采取了许多措施，其中最主要的是提倡大量增加青贮玉蜀黍的播种面积。根据实验的结果，用青贮玉蜀黍作饲料能大大增加牛奶的产量和降低牛奶的生产成本。农林部决定在今年播种青贮玉蜀黍二十五万公顷（比1959年增加136％），在今后数年中将扩大到一百万公顷。
