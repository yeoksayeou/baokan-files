    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 25th: The Vietnam News Agency published a commentary today stating that Vientiane Radio announced on March 24th the names of nine representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front who were approved to participate in the election. However, the names of Prince Souphanouvong and the other seven members of the Lao Patriotic Front were not on the list, and they remain imprisoned.
    The commentary said that, clearly, under the powerful struggle of the people of all strata in Laos and the condemnation of progressive world opinion, the pro-American elements in the Lao authorities did not dare to openly reject all the election applications submitted by the representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front. They were forced to announce the list of some candidates of the Lao Patriotic Front, but still did not allow the main leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front to participate in the general election. They are still sending troops to "sweep" and persecute the people, and slaughter cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front and former resistance personnel. The commentary pointed out that this practice of the Lao authorities exposes their hypocrisy, as they have repeatedly announced that they respect the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and recognize the right of the Lao Patriotic Front leaders to participate in the general election.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 29th: According to "Lao Patriotic News," the "sweeps" conducted by the Kingdom's army in various parts of Laos, driven by the U.S. imperialists and the warlord heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," have caused serious damage to the lives and property of the people.
    The newspaper said in its March 20th issue that the Kingdom's army, wherever it goes, wantonly destroys crops, prohibits the people from harvesting, destroys rice fields, builds airports and military camps, burns granaries, and kills oxen. According to preliminary statistics for 1959, they destroyed a total of 1,534 mu of rice fields. In the first three months of this year alone, they burned 320 houses and killed 156 oxen.
    The Kingdom's army also forced the people to "merge villages," driving the people from small villages to large villages, and forcing the people to live in areas around the Kingdom's army strongholds.
    The newspaper pointed out that at present, the lives of the people are very painful in all the places that have been "swept" by the Kingdom's army, with serious shortages of clothing, food, agricultural tools, and medicines, and various diseases are prevalent and spreading among the people.

    越南通讯社揭露
    老挝亲美分子在耍两面手法
    被迫公布爱国战线党部分候选人名单但仍监禁苏发努冯等人
    据新华社河内25日电　越南通讯社今天发表评论说，万象电台3月24日公布了被批准参加竞选的老挝爱国战线党九名代表的名单，但是在上述名单中没有苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党另外七名议员的名字，他们仍然被监禁。
    评论说，显然，在老挝各阶层人民的强大斗争和世界进步舆论的谴责下，老挝当局中的亲美分子不敢公然全部拒绝老挝爱国战线党各代表提出的竞选申请书，他们被迫公布老挝爱国战线党部分候选人的名单，但是仍然不让老挝爱国战线党主要领导人参加大选，仍然在派军队去“扫荡”和迫害人民，屠杀老挝爱国战线党干部和前抗战人员。评论指出，老挝当局的这种做法，揭穿了它们的假面具，因为过去它们曾经多次宣布要尊重日内瓦协议和万象协议、承认老挝爱国战线党领导人参加大选的权利。
    据新华社河内29日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”报道，美帝国主义和“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀头目们驱使王国军队在老挝各地进行的“扫荡”，使人民的生命财产遭到严重的损失。
    这家报纸在3月20日出版的一期中说，王国军队在所到之处，大肆破坏庄稼，禁止人民收割，毁坏稻田，修建机场和军营，烧毁谷仓，杀死耕牛。据1959年的初步统计，他们共破坏了一千五百三十四亩稻田。今年头三个月就烧毁房屋三百二十间，杀死耕牛一百五十六头。
    王国军队还强迫人民“并村”，把小村庄的人民赶到大村庄去，强迫人民在王国军队据点周围地区居住。
    这家报纸指出，目前，凡是经过王国军队“扫荡”的地方，人民的生活非常痛苦，缺衣、缺食、缺农具、缺药品的现象严重，各种疾病在人民中流行和蔓延。
