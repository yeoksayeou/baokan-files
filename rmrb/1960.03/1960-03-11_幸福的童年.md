Happy Childhood

Under the people's democratic regime, Romanian children live a happy life.

From birth, children receive proper care. The country currently has more than 1,600 maternity hospitals, 3,500 hospitals and clinics, and approximately 8,000 child health units.

Pediatricians regularly care for children's growth, helping mothers prevent disease and helping them to reasonably breastfeed children; watching over them day by day. Doctors and nurses regularly visit children's homes. The diagnoses they give and the medicines and vitamins they prescribe are free.

When working mothers go to work, their children are placed in nurseries (if they are infants) or in day-care kindergartens (over three years old). Under the careful guidance of educators, they spend a pleasant and rewarding day.

Children's cultural life is also very rich. Puppet theaters have been opened for young audiences in Bucharest and twenty other cities. Many theaters specialize in children's plays written by famous writers. Two film studios, one producing cartoons and the other producing puppet films, specialize in producing children's films.

Romanian children enjoy the love of all the people.

    幸福的童年
    在人民民主政权下，罗马尼亚儿童过着幸福的生活。
    从出生时起，儿童就得到妥善照顾。全国目前有一千六百多所产妇所，三千五百所医院和诊疗所，约八千个儿童卫生单位。
    小儿科医生们经常关心儿童的成长，帮助母亲预防疾病，也帮助她们合理地哺育儿童；逐日地看护他们。医生和护士定期地访问儿童的家庭。他们给予的诊断和所开的药品和维他命都是免费的。
    参加工作的母亲们上班工作时，孩子就放在托儿所里（如果是婴儿的话），或者放在日托幼儿园里（三岁以上）。他们在教养员的精心教导下，度过了愉快而有益的一天。
    儿童的文化生活也很丰富。布加勒斯特和其他二十个城市为小观众开设了木偶剧院。很多剧院专为儿童演出由著名作家所写的儿童剧本。两个电影制片厂，一个生产卡通片，另一个生产木偶片，专门摄制儿童影片。
    罗马尼亚儿童享有全体人民对他们的爱护。
