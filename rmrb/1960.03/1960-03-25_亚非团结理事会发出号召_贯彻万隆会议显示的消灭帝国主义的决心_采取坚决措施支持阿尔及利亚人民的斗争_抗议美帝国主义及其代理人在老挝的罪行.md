Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 23rd – The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a call today, urging the people and governments of Asian and African countries to strengthen their struggle to implement the Bandung Principles, eliminate imperialism, and strive for peace.

In a call to the people and governments of Asian and African countries to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference (opened on April 18, 1955), the Secretariat stated that the Bandung Conference demonstrated the unity of the Asian and African peoples and their full determination to completely eliminate imperialism. No force in the world can stop the movement of Asian and African peoples striving for national independence, and no one can stop the struggle of people around the world striving for peace.

The call, announced at a press conference, strongly condemned imperialism and colonialism, and demanded the abolition of all military blocs and military bases, and the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Asian and African countries. The call also demanded that atomic energy should be used for peaceful purposes, and Africa and Asia must become nuclear-weapon-free zones.

Referring to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference and the two All-African People's Conferences, the call stated that these conferences supported the Bandung Principles and played a significant role in the struggle against colonialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 23rd – The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today, calling on the people and governments of Asian and African countries to take decisive diplomatic, economic, and trade measures against France to support the Algerian people. The statement also called on people to join the African Volunteer Corps and fight alongside the Algerian national fighters.

The statement, issued for the "Algeria Day" to be held on the 30th of this month, said that this year, "Algeria Day" will be held on the eve of some important events in the history of the people of Asian and African countries. The General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference will hold a meeting in Accra at the end of March, and the African Emergency Conference against French atomic bomb tests in Africa and the Second Session of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference will be held in Accra and Conakry in April respectively. At all these meetings, the Algerian question will be the main issue to be discussed. The statement said that, in addition, there is constant news that the African people are very willing to participate as volunteers in the fighting in Algeria.

Referring to de Gaulle's recent bellicose remarks, the statement said that de Gaulle once attempted to confuse world opinion and make it believe that he really hoped to solve the Algerian problem. Now he has exposed his true colors. He even arrogantly said that the independence of Algeria is impossible and that he will not negotiate with the leaders of Algeria. The statement concluded by saying that the struggle of the heroes of Algeria is a struggle against imperialism, and its victory will mark the end of the imperialist system in Africa. It is for this reason that the African people will never stop supporting the Algerian fighters.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 23rd – The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council once again strongly protested against the heinous acts taken by the U.S. imperialists and their agents in Laos, and demanded the resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

A press release issued by the Secretariat here today said that the U.S. imperialists and the Laotian reactionary clique blatantly violated the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements and continued to ravage the democracy of Laos. They not only launched a civil war in Laos but also threatened the peace of the entire Indochina and Southeast Asian regions.

The press release pointed out that the U.S. imperialists, on the one hand, continued to send a large number of military personnel and transport a large number of weapons to Laos militarily, and on the other hand, intensified their interference in the democratic life of the Laotian people politically. The press release said that after taking over the Vientiane regime, the military clique supported by the United States is preparing to put the National Assembly in a state of permanent recess. In fact, this clique has arbitrarily tampered with the original election law. At present, Prince Souphanouvong and his colleagues are still in prison and cannot participate in the elections.

The press release pointed out that this is the reason why the Laotian people have stepped up their struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Laotian reactionary clique.

The Secretariat finally called on the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people to make every effort to establish democracy in Laos and promote peace in Indochina.

    亚非团结理事会发出号召
    贯彻万隆会议显示的消灭帝国主义的决心
    采取坚决措施支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争
    抗议美帝国主义及其代理人在老挝的罪行
    新华社开罗23日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处在今天发表的一项呼吁书中，要求亚非各国人民和政府为贯彻执行万隆原则和消灭帝国主义和争取和平而加强斗争。
    书记处在为纪念万隆会议（1955年4月18日开幕）五周年向亚非各国人民和政府发出的呼吁书中说，万隆会议显示了亚非人民的团结和他们为彻底消灭帝国主义的充分决心。世界上任何力量都不能阻止亚非人民争取走向民族独立的运动，谁也不能阻止世界各地争取和平的人民斗争。
    在记者招待会上宣布的这项呼吁书严厉谴责了帝国主义和殖民主义，并且要求取消一切军事集团和军事基地，要求一切外国军队立即撤出亚非国家。呼吁书还要求，原子能应当用来为和平服务，非洲和亚洲必须变为无核武器的地区。
    呼吁书在谈到亚非人民团结大会和两届全非人民大会时说，这些大会支持万隆原则，并且在反对殖民主义的斗争中起了显著的作用。
    新华社开罗23日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，号召亚非各国人民和政府对法国采取坚决的外交、经济和贸易措施以支持阿尔及利亚人民。声明还号召人们参加非洲志愿军团同阿尔及利亚民族战士并肩作战。
    这篇为本月30日举行“阿尔及利亚日”而发表的声明说，今年，“阿尔及利亚日”将在亚非各国人民的历史上发生某些重要事件的前夕举行。全非人民大会总务委员会将在3月底在阿克拉举行会议，反对法国在非洲进行原子弹试验的非洲紧急会议和亚非人民团结大会第二届会议将在4月分别在阿克拉和科纳克里举行。在所有这些会议上，阿尔及利亚问题将是要讨论的主要问题。声明说，此外，不断有消息表明，非洲人民非常愿意作为志愿军参加在阿尔及利亚的战斗。
    声明在谈到戴高乐最近的好战谈话时说，戴高乐一度企图迷惑世界舆论，并使它相信，他的确希望解决阿尔及利亚问题。现在，他已经暴露了他的真面目。他甚至嚣张地说，阿尔及利亚的独立是不可能的，他将不同阿尔及利亚的领袖进行谈判。声明最后说，阿尔及利亚的英雄们的斗争是矛头针对帝国主义的斗争，它的胜利将标志着帝国主义制度在非洲的终结。正是为了这个理由，非洲人民将决不停止对阿尔及利亚战士的支持。
    新华社开罗23日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处再次强烈抗议美帝国主义者和它在老挝的代理人所采取的罪恶行为，并要求恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。
    书记处今天在这里发表的新闻公报说，美帝国主义者和老挝反动集团罪恶昭彰地违反日内瓦协议和万象协议，继续蹂躏老挝的民主。他们不仅在老挝发动了内战，并且威胁着整个印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。
    新闻公报指出，美帝国主义一方面在军事上，继续派遣大批军事人员和运送大批武器到老挝去，在政治方面又加紧干涉老挝人民的民主生活。公报说，由美国扶植的军事集团在接管万象政权后，正在准备使国民议会处于永远休会状态。事实上，这个集团已经任意篡改了原来的选举法。目前，苏发努冯亲王和他的同事们仍被关在狱中，不能参加选举。
    公报指出，这就是老挝人民加紧进行反对美帝国主义和老挝反动集团的原因。
    书记处最后号召亚非各国人民和所有爱好和平的人民为建立老挝的民主和促进印度支那的和平而作出一切努力。
