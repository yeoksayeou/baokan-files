    A Vivid Historical Picture
    ——Reading "Legends and Stories of the Nian Army"
    Wang Yiqi, Wei Gang
    We were filled with excitement and joy after reading the newly discovered "Legends and Stories of the Nian Army."
    These stories are one of the fruitful results achieved in the widespread collection of folk tales (especially modern revolutionary legends) that began in various places on the basis of the mass folk song collection movement since the Great Leap Forward; it is a new achievement in the collection and sorting out of folk literature after the "Boxer Rebellion Stories."
    The Nian Army Uprising was a large-scale peasant revolutionary war in modern China. It lasted for fifteen or sixteen years, involved about eight or nine provinces, and numbered hundreds of thousands of people. It was a loyal ally of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom at the time and an important pillar of the anti-Qing movement north of the Yangtze River. The Taiping Army directly promoted the Nian Army Uprising, and the Nian Army also gave strong support to the Taiping Army. It was not only a bridge to promote the northward development of peasant uprisings, but also a barrier to resist the Qing government's southward attack. Although it finally moved towards failure due to the historical limitations of peasant uprisings, the Nian Army continued to persist in the struggle after the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, and had a certain impact on the development of modern Chinese revolutionary history.
    The Nian Army Uprising, which occupied an important position in the modern peasant movement, has always been slandered and vilified by the reactionary ruling classes of the past, calling them "Nian bandits," "Red Beards," "White Strikers" ... and so on.
    Now, the Nian Army legends and stories collected from the mouths of the working people use vivid artistic images to fully show the profound social causes and justice of the Nian Army Uprising, so that people can correctly understand the true face of the Nian Army and its revolutionary spirit, and restore the glorious reputation it deserves.
    These Nian Army stories first widely and deeply reflect the historical background and social conditions at that time.
    Since the Opium War, China had gradually fallen into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty bowed their knees to foreign countries, ceded power and humiliated the country; and they cruelly suppressed the people internally. In addition, there were years of drought and famine, and the people were hungry and cold; while bureaucrats, landlords, gentry, bullies, etc. continued to exploit and extract, forcing the people to have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth. Therefore, they "rose up" and launched an armed struggle against the Qing Dynasty's rule and officials, local tyrants, and bullies. As soon as the horn of the uprising sounded, all parties responded, and the spark quickly turned into a prairie fire, burning across the vast plains of central China. These historical situations are vividly reflected in the oral creations of the working people. For example, the story "Making a Scene for Grain" truly reveals the motivation for the uprising of Zhang Lexing, the leader of the Nian Army alliance. At that time, the Huaibei area where Zhang Lexing lived was "nine disasters in ten years, either flooding or drought," "the rich are fat and white, and the poor are hungry and swaying," "a three-year-old child is sold on the street, and cannot be exchanged for half a ladle of flour from the rich." The people of Zhang Lexing's hometown (Chiheji - present-day Guoyang County, Anhui Province) really couldn't live, so they had to bite the bullet and borrow grain from the local rich man's family, willing to pay the interest of "double donkey rolls," and said all the good things; but the rich man not only refused to lend, but also called the lackeys to beat the poor - "Beat them to death, no matter!" At this time, the villagers could no longer bear it, and under the leadership of Zhang Lexing, they raised their sticks and loudly announced that "the grain beaten by the poor should be managed by the poor!..." They opened the gate of the rich man's granary and divided the grain. From this time on, "Chiheji area became lively - today this village beats the landlord (rich man), tomorrow that village divides the grain of the landlord, the rich...moved to Dezhou (Bozhou), and the state official was also anxious, and sent down messengers, small teams, to go to the countryside to handle the case," but because the cases were everywhere, they could not be handled! Sometimes "if you are not careful, even the messengers will not be able to return!" As a result, the state official was at a loss. - At this time, the poor people "realized that the united force is great, thirty people in a class, fifty people in a group, all organized, everywhere beating the old rich, dividing the grain, smashing the prison shops, resisting the official soldiers.... Later, they all submitted to Zhang Laoluo, and in less than a year, gathered hundreds of thousands of people...."
    The "start" and "joining the Nian" situations of other famous leaders of the Nian Army, such as Ren Zhu, Gong De..., were roughly similar.
    It can be seen that the Nian Army Uprising was the result of being "forced to rebel by the officials, and had to rebel" under the reactionary rule at that time.
    Secondly, these stories vividly depict the heroic and magnificent battles of the Nian Army with vigorous and heroic brushstrokes, and shape many brilliant images of Nian Army heroes.
    The stories describe the heroic and tenacious battles of the Nian Army very well. They are full of a strong atmosphere of optimism, and the overall tone is majestic and profound, making people feel refreshed and high-spirited after reading them. The same is the description of war, but it can show the unique style of each specific battle. In these battle stories, there are descriptions of the Nian Army's powerful military power, such as "Lu Wang Defeats Li Hongzhang"; there are descriptions of the Nian Army's resourcefulness, such as "Fighting Gao Gong" and "Gong Blind Man's Ingenious Capture of Mengcheng"; there are descriptions of the Nian Army's tenacious and magnificent battles, such as "Burning Longshan" in "Pepper King" (using caves to fight, resisting the enemy's smoke and fire, and finally breaking through victoriously); there are descriptions of winning more with less, and winning the strong with the weak, such as "Battle of Changzhigou"... and so on. It's really rich and diverse, and colorful! Among them, the battle scene of "Lu Wang Defeats Li Hongzhang" is the most wonderful. In this wonderful story, the working people have drawn a picture for us like an iron torrent.
    These stories, through the description of battles, also shaped many vivid peasant heroes. - These peasant heroes stand in front of the readers with their different styles and unique personalities, flying high and full of spirit. Such as Zhang Lexing's foresight, mature and calm; Lu Wang Ren Zhu's magnificent demeanor, and decisive command; Gong De's free and easy, witty and resourceful; Pepper King and Chen Gongbao's bravery and valor...; in addition, there are many female heroes, such as Miss Cai, Chen Bagu, Li Sanniang...; there are also young talents, such as Zhang Wuhai, Zhang Biangeng (this little "Nian child" of ten years old, was able to kill the famous Seng Gelinqin with a stone)... Reading these stories is like being in the gallery of ancient peasant heroes, full of various kinds of treasures, and you can't take them all in.
    Most of these heroes are real people in history; but in folk tales, after the talented artistic processing of the working people, their images are permeated with a strong romantic spirit; therefore, their qualities, personalities and images are more moving. - This should be said to be a major achievement of the Nian Army stories in artistic creation. Third, these stories also truthfully and movingly reflect the strict discipline and good relationship between the army and the people of the Nian Army. The reason why the Nian Army was able to develop rapidly and disrupt the rule of the Qing government to a certain extent and confront the rulers of the Qing Dynasty was mainly because the wars they waged had obvious revolutionary and just qualities. Their resistance activities, to a certain extent, reflected the expectations and requirements of the working people at that time. This is clearly expressed in stories such as "Chasing Sheep," "Seeing a Doctor," and "Returning Things to the Owner." In "Double Seat Mountain," Zhang Laoluo avenged the spirits of the dead and solemnly shouted: "I will avenge thousands of years of grievances, and I will plant the grass and trees on the barren mountain!" The strict discipline of the Nian Army was also an important reason why it won the support and love of the broad masses of the people at that time. The fact that the Nian Army won the hearts of the people was undeniable even by the reactionary ruling class. For example, the traitorous executioner Zeng Guofan once bluntly said in his memorial: "The harassment of the officers and soldiers is abnormal, and it is almost as miserable as the bandits passing by like mats and the soldiers passing by like washing; the people in the fortresses regard the officers and soldiers as enemies, and have forgiving words for the bandits, and even those who follow the bandits are not ashamed." Zuo Zongtang also mentioned in his letter to his son that the people in Zhili and Shandong "especially hate the soldiers; if they see them, they must kill them, and if they kill them, they must poison them...." (Both are seen in Fan Wenlan's "Modern History of China," page 158) The Nian Army was completely different from these "officers and soldiers" who were like bandits, they were indeed disciplined and worked for the welfare of the people. For example, the story "Returning Things to the Owner" describes how the Nian Army helped a woman who had been robbed by a rogue to redeem her original items even in the emergency of the war; later, because the rogue relied on his power to be fierce, he was killed, avenging the woman and eliminating harm for the local people. In the story "Look, Are They Green Eyes?" the strict military discipline of the Nian Army and their respect for women are even more movingly described. Li Cheng, the flag leader of the Nian Army, once fought with Seng Gelinqin's troops and rescued more than 300 young women who had been looted by the Seng bandits, temporarily placing them in a large courtyard, locking the door, and sending soldiers to guard them, waiting for Li Cheng to come back to deal with them. These women, because they were deceived by the enemy's propaganda, mistakenly believed that the Nian Army were all "red beards," "green eyes," and "did all kinds of evil," and were very afraid in their hearts. When they saw the Nian Army soldiers covering their eyes with red cloth to comfort them and send them food, their doubts began to waver, and they bravely asked: "Why do you cover your eyes with red cloth?" At this time, the Nian Army soldiers told them: "This is the rule of our Nian Army, in front of women, it is not allowed to say village words (impolite words), and it is not allowed to look at women randomly." - Therefore, their doubts and fears were all eliminated, and what replaced them was heartfelt gratitude.
    In short, the Nian Army stories, whether from the perspective of ideological content or artistic achievements, can be said to be rare treasures in modern folk literature, worthy of our attention. However, the stories we have read so far are only a part of the materials excavated in Guoyang and Mengcheng counties in Anhui, which is far from enough to see the full picture of the Nian Army Uprising. These areas are the birthplace of the Nian Army, and the legends and stories about the Nian Army are extremely rich, and should continue to be vigorously and deeply collected and sorted out. Other areas where the Nian Army operated (this area is very vast) must also be circulating a large number of legends and stories. Therefore, we eagerly hope that the relevant departments in all areas where the Nian Army operated can pay attention to this work, organize forces, and systematically excavate these stories buried in the memories of the elderly as soon as possible, so that they can become the precious spiritual wealth of the people in the socialist era.
    [Note] More than 20 articles of "Legends and Stories of the Nian Army" have been published successively in "Folk Literature" September 1959 issue, 1960 issue 1 and 2, as well as Shanghai "Folk Literature Collection" ninth book, "Anhui Folk Story Collection" and other books and periodicals.

    生动的历史图景
    ——读“捻军的传说故事”
    王一奇　蔚钢
    我们读了新近发掘出来的“捻军的传说故事”，心里充满了兴奋和喜悦。
    这些故事是大跃进以来，在全民采风运动的基础上，各地开始广泛地搜集民间故事（尤其是近代革命传说故事）当中所取得的丰硕成果之一；是继“义和团故事”之后，在民间文学搜集整理工作上一个新的收获。
    捻军起义，是我国近代一次规模巨大的农民革命战争。它前后共持续了十五六年，活动地区约八九省，人数曾达到几十万，它是当时太平天国的忠实盟军，是长江以北抗清运动的重要支柱。太平军给捻军起义以直接推动，捻军也给太平军以有力的支援。它一方面是促使农民起义向北发展的桥梁，同时又是抵挡清廷向南进攻的屏障，虽然最后终于因为农民起义的历史局限性，仍然是走向了失败的道路，但是太平天国革命失败以后，捻军还继续坚持了斗争，对中国近代革命历史的发展，有着一定的影响。
    在近代农民运动中占重要地位的捻军起义，一向遭到历来的反动统治阶级的诽谤和诬蔑，称它们为“捻匪”、“红胡子”、“白撞手”……等等。
    现在，从劳动人民口头上搜集到的捻军传说故事，用生动的艺术形象，充分显示了捻军起义的深刻的社会原因及其正义性，使人们正确地认识到捻军的本来面目和它的革命精神，给捻军恢复了它应得的光荣名誉。
    这些捻军故事，首先是广泛而深刻地反映了当时的历史背景和社会状况。
    自鸦片战争以来，中国逐渐沦入半殖民地、半封建的境地，清朝的统治者，对外屈膝求和，丧权辱国；对内则残酷镇压。加上当时连年荒旱，人民饥寒交迫；而官僚、地主、豪绅、恶霸等，仍然进行剥削、榨取，逼得人民上天无路，入地无门。于是，“揭竿而起”，展开了反对清朝统治和官吏、土豪们的武装斗争。起义的号角一响，四方群起响应，星星之火，很快地变成了燎原的烈焰，燃遍了中国中部的广大平原。这些历史情况，在劳动人民的口头创作中，都得到了鲜明的反映。如“闹粮”这篇故事，就真实地揭示了作为捻军盟主的张乐行起义的动因。当时，张乐行所生活着的淮北地区，是“十年九灾，不淹就旱”，“财主撑得白胖，穷人饿得打晃”，“三岁孩子大街卖，换不来财主的半瓢面”。张乐行的家乡（雉河集——今安徽涡阳县）的人民，实在无法生活了，只好硬着头皮去向当地大财主家借粮，宁愿出“双驴打滚”的利息，并说尽了好话；但大财主不但不借，反而叫狗腿子打穷人们——“打死勿论！”这时乡亲们实在忍无可忍了，就在张乐行的领导下，举起了棍棒，大声宣布了“穷人打的粮食，应归穷人管！……”打开了财主家粮仓的大门，分了粮食。从这时起，“雉河集一带，可闹腾起来了——今个这个寨打日子主儿（财主），明个那村分财东的粮食，有钱的……都往德州（亳州）里挪，州官也着了急，派下差人，小队子，下乡办案”，但因遍地都是案子，办也无法办！有时“一不小心，连差人也回不去！”结果，弄得州官一筹莫展。——这时，穷人们“才知道联合一块力量大，三十人一班，五十人一伙，都组织起来了，到处打老财，分粮食，砸监店，拒官兵……。后来，都归顺张老洛了，没撑一年，聚有几十万人……。”
    捻军其他一些著名领袖，如任柱、龚德……等人的“起手”、“入捻”情况，也都和这大致相似。
    可以看出，捻军起义，是在当时的反动统治之下，“官逼民反，不得不反”，而被“逼上梁山”的结果。
    其次，这些故事，以雄劲豪迈的笔触出色地描写了捻军英勇壮烈的战斗，并塑造了不少捻军英雄的光辉形象。
    故事对捻军的英勇顽强的战斗，是描写得非常出色的。充满着浓烈的乐观主义气氛，整个基调是雄壮的，浑厚的，使人读了，精神振奋，意志昂扬。同是描写战争，却又能显示出每个具体战斗的独特的风貌。在这些战斗故事中，有描写捻军的强大的军事威力的，如《鲁王大败李鸿章》；有描写捻军的足智多谋的，如《打高公》、《龚瞎子智取蒙城》；有描写捻军顽强壮烈的战斗的，如《胡椒大王》中的《火烧龙山》（利用山洞作战，抵住了敌人的烟熏火烧，终于胜利突围）；有描写以少胜多、以弱胜强的，如《大战长直沟》……等等。真是丰富多样，彩色缤纷！其中以《鲁王大败李鸿章》的战斗场面写得最精彩。在这篇精彩的故事中，劳动人民为我们绘制了一幅铁流似的画图。
    这些故事通过战斗的描写，还塑造了不少栩栩如生的农民英雄人物。——这些农民英雄人物带着各自不同的风貌和独特的性格，神采飞扬、精神抖擞地站立在读者的面前。如张乐行的深谋远虑、老练沉着；鲁王任柱的气度恢宏、指挥若定；龚得的洒脱旷达、机智多谋；胡椒大王和陈公豹的骠悍骁勇……；此外，还有很多妇女英雄人物，如蔡小姐、陈八姑、李三娘……；也有少年俊杰，如张五孩，张便耕（这个十来岁的小“捻童”，竟能用一块石头把赫赫有名的僧格林沁砸死）……。使人读了这些故事，宛如置身于古代农民英雄人物的画廊中，琳琅满目，应接不暇。
    这些英雄人物，大都是历史上实有其人；但在民间传说中，经过劳动人民的天才的艺术加工，使得他们的形象渗透着浓厚的浪漫精神；因此，他们的品质、性格与形象，显得更为动人。——这应当说是捻军故事在艺术创造上的重大成就。第三，这些故事，还真实地、动人地反映了捻军的严明的纪律和良好的军民关系。捻军之所以能迅速发展，在一定时期内扰乱了清廷的统治，和清朝统治者相对抗，主要是因为它们所进行的战争具有明显的革命性和正义性。它们的反抗活动，在一定程度上反映了当时的劳动人民的期望与要求。这在《撵绵羊》、《瞧病》和《赎物还主》……等故事中，都有鲜明的表现。在《双座山》中，张老洛为死难的精灵复仇，庄严地喊出过：“千年的冤仇我来报，枯山的草木我来栽！”捻军的纪律严明，也是它获得当时广大群众的拥护和爱戴的重要原因。捻军深得民心的事实，连反动的统治阶级也无法抹煞。如汉奸刽子手曾国藩在奏折中，曾直言不讳地说：“官兵骚扰异常，几有贼过如篾、兵过如洗之惨；民圩仇视官兵，于贼匪反有恕词，即从贼亦无愧色。”左宗棠在给他儿子的信中，也提到：直隶、山东一带人民“专以兵勇为仇；见则必杀，杀则必毒……。”（均见范文澜著《中国近代史》一五八页）捻军和这些贼匪一样的“官兵”完全不同，他们确实是纪律严明，为人民谋福利的。如《赎物还主》这篇故事，描写了捻军在战事紧急的情况下，还帮助了一个被恶棍抢劫的妇女赎回原物；后来因为这个恶棍恃强逞凶，就把他杀了，为妇女出了气，为当地人民除了害。在《你看，是绿眼睛吗？》这篇故事中，更是十分感人地描写了捻军的严明的军纪，和他们对妇女们的尊重。捻军的旗主李成，有一次和僧格林沁部队作战，把被僧贼掠去的三百多名年轻妇女全部救回，暂时安置在一个大院里，锁上门，并派遣士兵把守，等候李成回来处理。这些妇女因为受了敌人的欺骗宣传，误认捻军都是些“红胡子”、“绿眼睛”、“无恶不作”的人，心中非常害怕，当她们看见捻军大兵眼上蒙着红布来进行安慰并给她们送菜饭的时候，疑虑才开始动摇，就大着胆子问道：“你们为什么用红布把眼睛蒙起来呢？”这时捻军士兵告诉她们说：“这是俺捻军的规矩，在妇女面前，不准说村话（不文雅的话），不准乱看妇女。”——于是，她们的疑虑、恐惧全部消除了，代之而来的是出自衷心的感激。
    总之，捻军故事，无论从思想内容或艺术成就哪一方面来看，都可以说是近代民间文学中不可多得的珍品，值得我们重视。不过，目前我们所读到的这些故事，还只是安徽涡阳、蒙城两县所挖掘出来的一部分材料，远不足以窥见捻军起义的全貌。这些地区，是当年捻军的发祥之地，关于捻军的传说故事的蕴藏，是极其丰富的，应当继续大力地、深入地搜集整理。捻军活动的其他地区（这个地区是非常广阔的），必然也同样地流传着大量的传说故事。因此，我们热切地希望一切有捻军活动的地区的有关部门，都能注意这项工作，组织力量，有计划的、系统的把这些埋藏在老人们记忆中的故事，早日挖掘出来，使它成为社会主义时代人民的宝贵的精神财富。
   〔注〕《捻军的传说故事》在《民间文学》1959年9月号、1960年1、2月号，以及上海《民间文学集刊》第九本，《安徽民间故事集》等书刊上已陆续发表了二十多篇。
