    At 3:00 p.m., Chairman Zhu De announced the opening of the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly. The band played the national anthem.
    Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan on behalf of the State Council.
    In his report, Li Fuchun summarized in detail the great achievements of China's national economic development in 1959 and the main experiences since the Great Leap Forward, elaborated on the guiding principles and tasks for national economic development in 1960, and called on the people of the whole country to further carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic development plan.
    Li Fuchun said that in 1959, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in China continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in the national economy on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The figures listed in the report show that in 1959, China's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 31.1% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, of which the total industrial output value increased by 39.3% compared with 1958, and the total agricultural output value increased by 16.7% compared with 1958; the total amount of basic construction investment within the state budget increased by 24.5% compared with 1958, and all economic sectors continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward development speed in 1959; science, education, culture, sports, and health undertakings have also been greatly developed. The result of the two years of the Great Leap Forward is that China has completed the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. He said that this is a great victory for the Chinese people, and this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.
    Li Fuchun emphasized that the continuous Great Leap Forward for two years has proved that the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great creation with extremely rich content. Its starting point is: the people are the creators of history and the most active factor of the productive forces. Li Fuchun said that in order to continuously give play to the initiative of the people, we have followed the principle of combining the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the development stage of revolution in Marxism-Leninism, as expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong, and continuously and reasonably resolved the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. Constantly reforming the relations of production and the superstructure according to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces has opened up broad roads for the continuous development of productive forces. He said that after the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production achieved a decisive victory in 1956, a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts was carried out in 1957. In 1958 and 1959, a series of reforms were carried out in the management system, rules and regulations, labor relations, and leadership methods in enterprises and state organs under the ownership by the whole people. In particular, a set of "walking on two legs" policy was implemented in socialist construction. In all economic work, the Party's leadership was continuously strengthened, politics was put in command, and large-scale mass movements were launched. All this has comprehensively and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the people, thus enabling China's socialist construction to achieve a continuous Great Leap Forward.
    When talking about these rich experiences, he particularly pointed out the important significance of the development of people's communes in China. He said: Due to the improvement of the people's political consciousness and the development of the Great Leap Forward situation, the vast rural areas of China have realized the people's communeization. This kind of people's commune, which is larger in scale, has a higher degree of public ownership, combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates government and commune, is the best social grass-roots organizational form for accelerating China's socialist construction. In the future, it will be the best organizational from for China's rural areas to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialist society to communist society. It has further mobilized and organized the strength of more than 500 million farmers in China. He said that now, all cities across the country are vigorously running people's communes, vigorously running street industries, vigorously running suburban agriculture, vigorously running public welfare undertakings, and vigorously running public canteens, widely organizing the economic life of residents, further organizing the urban people, and liberating thousands of urban housewives from household labor and enabling them to participate in social labor. All this is not only conducive to the development of production and construction, but also conducive to the thorough transformation of urban social life.
    Li Fuchun said that the great practice of 1958 and 1959 has enabled us to gain rich experience. These experiences tell us that under the socialist system, it is entirely possible to develop the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward. It is an objective inevitability. The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are the three magic weapons for China's entire socialist construction period, and they are the products of Mao Zedong Thought. The banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Earnestly studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future.
    Li Fuchun said that 1960 is an extremely important year for the development of socialist construction in China. The efforts of the people of the whole country to strive for the continued leap forward of the national economy this year will lay the foundation for the continuous leap forward during the Second Five-Year Plan period and even the entire 1960s. He said that in 1960, we must better implement the Party's general line of building socialism, and strive for a comprehensive and better leap forward in the national economy on the basis of the continuous leap forward in the past two years. In order to realize this task, the arrangement of the 1960 national economic plan should further determine that agriculture is the foundation and industry is the leading factor, so that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined; we should continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key in industry and grain as the key in agriculture, and making overall arrangements, and further strengthen the transportation industry, power industry, and mining industry, so as to more appropriately handle the relationship between heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, and between various industries within each sector, so that the national economy can leap forward better.
    Li Fuchun said that agriculture plays an extremely important role in developing the national economy, and it is the foundation of the national economy. Accelerating the development of agriculture and conscientiously implementing the forty articles of the agricultural development outline is the central link for developing China's socialist planned economy at a high speed and in proportion. In 1960, agricultural production should continue to take grain as the key, and on the premise of ensuring increased grain production, make overall arrangements for the production of various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicines, and miscellaneous crops, and implement simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and strive for the overall and great development of agriculture. Putting animal husbandry in the same position as crop cultivation, and putting pig raising in the first place in animal husbandry, is an important step to promote the comprehensive development of agriculture.
    In order to develop agriculture faster, in 1960, while further giving play to the superiority of the people's communes, we must actively promote the technical transformation of agriculture and improve agricultural labor productivity. He said that in the past ten years, China's worker-peasant alliance has gone through two stages, namely the land reform stage and the collectivization stage. Under the condition that the people's communeization has been realized in the rural areas, we should promote the worker-peasant alliance to a new stage, so that industry can actively support agriculture, and agriculture can gradually be established on a modern basis. In terms of agricultural mechanization, our goal is: from 1959, strive to solve the problem in four years on a small scale, solve it in seven years in medium-size projects, and solve it in ten years on a large scale, and strive to basically realize agricultural mechanization and water conservancy in the whole country in about ten years, and realize a considerable degree of electrification. In order to promote the rapid development of agriculture, all departments such as industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, and health must regard supporting agriculture as their important task. Among the universal support for agriculture from all departments, heavy industry bears a particularly important task. In 1960, 1.1 million tons of steel distributed by the state for the manufacture of agricultural machinery and tools will be about double that of 1959. In 1960, agricultural machinery power will increase by more than 5 million horsepower. In this year, the area of mechanized cultivation will reach more than 100 million mu, and the area of mechanical irrigation will reach more than 200 million mu.
    Li Fuchun said that in 1960, large-scale basic construction will continue to be carried out. In addition to continuing to pay attention to the construction of necessary large-scale projects, industry, transportation, and various localities and people's communes should continue to actively develop a number of "small modern" enterprises and "small indigenous" enterprises, and at the same time improve the production level of the original "small modern" enterprises and "small indigenous" enterprises. In places with coal and iron, a number of new "small modern" enterprises or "small indigenous" enterprises for coal mining, coking, iron smelting, and steel making should be actively established to drive the development of "small modern" enterprises and "small indigenous" enterprises in other industries, and to meet the needs of production and construction development, build the necessary number of small modern railways or small indigenous railways according to the possible conditions in various places.
    Vice Premier Li Fuchun then made explanations on the arrangement of the 1960 plan indicators in nine aspects: heavy industry, heavy industry supporting agriculture, agriculture, light industry, rural people's commune industry, urban people's commune industry and urban street industry, transportation industry, commerce, labor wages, scientific research, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings. The total industrial and agricultural output value in 1960 will reach 298 billion yuan, an increase of 23% compared with 1959. Among them, the total industrial output value will be 210 billion yuan, an increase of 29%; the total agricultural output value will be 88 billion yuan, an increase of 12%. Basic construction investment will be 32.5 billion yuan (investment raised by local governments and enterprises themselves, about 6 billion yuan, is not included in this figure), an increase of 21.7%.
    Various major industrial and agricultural products included in this year's plan have a large increase. Steel (excluding indigenous steel) will be 18.4 million tons, an increase of 38%; coal will be 425 million tons, an increase of 22%; the output of grain and cotton will increase by about 10%. Cotton yarn will be 9 million pieces, an increase of 9%; cotton cloth will be 7.6 billion meters, an increase of 1.3%; sugar will be 1.3 million tons, an increase of 15%. The output value of rural people's commune industry will increase by about 50% compared with 1959; the output value of urban people's commune industry and street industry will increase by about 100%. The freight volume of various modern transportation tools will increase by 42% compared with 1959. The total retail sales of social commodities in 1960 will increase by 14% compared with 1959. In 1960, the labor productivity of the industrial sector will increase by about 25%, and the average wage of employees is planned to increase by 6%.
    After listing the development plans for scientific research and cultural, educational, and health undertakings in 1960, Li Fuchun said that all provinces, cities, autonomous regions, special districts, and counties should actively develop secondary schools and universities that serve local production and construction under the guidance of the state plan. In the field of scientific research, it is necessary to mobilize forces from all sides, work hard to learn, study, and master the latest scientific and technological achievements in the world, summarize the rich experience of mass practice, and strive to realize the twelve-year scientific and technological plan in a relatively short period of time. In the field of cultural undertakings, implement the policy of "overall planning, active development, key construction, and improving quality" to ensure that cultural undertakings better cooperate with and promote the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, serve the technical revolution and cultural revolution, and set off a climax of building socialist culture. In the field of health undertakings, continue to vigorously carry out mass health campaigns to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate major diseases. Continue to vigorously carry out mass sports activities in urban and rural areas.
    Li Fuchun pointed out that the 1960 national economic plan is a plan for continued leap forward, and it is also a plan that can be completed and overfulfilled through efforts. If we successfully realize this plan, we may be able to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 ahead of schedule.
    In the last part of his report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun talked in detail about the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as its content that the Chinese people are carrying out. He said that the great march of the Chinese people to conquer backward technology has begun to be launched throughout the country. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement with broad mass participation is the inevitable result of continuous economic revolution, political revolution, ideological revolution, and cultural revolution, and the inevitable product of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. This movement will accelerate the process of China's industrial modernization, agricultural modernization, and scientific and cultural modernization, further increase the speed of socialist construction, and further improve the communist consciousness and scientific, technological, and cultural level of the people.
    Li Fuchun said that we have already achieved the speed of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and we should also strive for the speed of the Great Leap Forward in technological improvement. He called on the people of the whole country to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement more widely and more deeply, so that it can be continuously consolidated, developed, and improved, and so that it can move forward along the correct, scientific, and national road.
    Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, then delivered a report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft. He said that the implementation of the 1959 national budget was good. As a result of the implementation, both revenue and expenditure exceeded the budget approved by the First Session of the Second National People's Congress in April 1959, and revenue was greater than expenditure, with a slight surplus.
    Li Xiannian said that the 1959 national final account revenue was 54.16 billion yuan, equivalent to 104.1% of the original budget of 52.01 billion yuan. In the 1959 final account revenue, the revenue of enterprises and institutions was 104.9% of the original budget; various taxes were 102.9% of the original budget; and other revenue was 105.7% of the original budget.
    The 1959 national final account expenditure was 52.77 billion yuan, equivalent to 101.5% of the original budget of 52.01 billion yuan. In the 1959 final account expenditure, economic construction expenditure was 32.17 billion yuan, 101.5% of the original budget; social, cultural, and educational expenditure was 5.86 billion yuan, 102.3% of the original budget; national defense expenditure was 5.8 billion yuan, 100% of the original budget; and administrative management expenditure was 2.9 billion yuan, 107.7% of the original budget. In addition, there were debt expenditures of 970 million yuan, foreign aid expenditures of 350 million yuan, other expenditures of 290 million yuan, and additional bank credit funds of 4.43 billion yuan.
    In 1959, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure offset each other, resulting in a surplus of 1.39 billion yuan. These surpluses are the surpluses of the local budgets, which, together with the local surpluses of 1.77 billion yuan carried over from 1958, totaled 3.16 billion yuan, which will be carried over by the local governments to 1960 for arrangement and use and will not be included in the state budget.
    Li Xiannian pointed out: The vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy launched under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on opposing right-leaning and encouraging hard work played a decisive role in the Great Leap Forward of the national economy and the realization of the national budget in 1959. He said that after the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, the leap forward situation of China's national economy, which began in 1958 with both high speed and proportional development, has been established, and China's financial work has also entered a new situation with the leap forward of production. The characteristics of this new situation are: more revenue, more expenditure, more construction; more revenue, more expenditure, more construction; rational and economical use of funds, both ensuring the high-speed development of the national economy and maintaining the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure. The state's finances, like the entire national economy, originally developed at a high speed during the First Five-Year Plan period, and have entered a new stage of continuous leap forward at an even higher speed since 1958. This is reflected in the higher speed growth of fiscal revenue; the further expansion of the scale of basic construction expenditure; the more rational and economical use of construction funds; and further changes in the composition of fiscal expenditure. The proportion of economic construction and cultural construction expenditure in the entire fiscal expenditure averaged 79.6% in 1958 and 1959, while it averaged 63.9% during the First Five-Year Plan period; the proportion of national defense expenditure and administrative expenditure in the entire fiscal expenditure averaged 17% in 1958 and 1959, while it averaged 30.9% during the First Five-Year Plan period. The proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan of the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China once proposed that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the proportion of economic and cultural construction expenditure must be increased to 60% to 70%, and the proportion of military expenditure and administrative management expenses must be reduced to about 20%. This requirement has been realized three years ahead of schedule and even better.
    Li Xiannian then reported on the arrangement of the 1960 national budget. He pointed out that this budget draft was compiled according to the requirements of the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960. This is a budget that accelerates the development of industry, vigorously supports agriculture, and actively develops cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings. It is also a budget that looks ahead and behind, and is both active and reliable. He said that the 1960 national budget revenue is 70.02 billion yuan, and the budget expenditure is 70.02 billion yuan, with a balance between revenue and expenditure. Compared with the 1959 final accounts, revenue increased by 29.3% and expenditure increased by 32.7%, which is basically in line with the indicators of industrial and agricultural production growth stipulated in the draft national economic plan.
    Li Xiannian specifically explained the revenue and expenditure of various types of the 1960 national budget. He said that in the 1960 national budget revenue, the payments of state-owned enterprises under ownership by the whole people, including profits and taxes, are 65.43 billion yuan, accounting for 93.4% of the total budget revenue. The vast majority of the increase in the 1960 national budget revenue comes from the increase in the payments of state-owned enterprises, which is an important sign that China's financial foundation is as solid as a rock. Despite the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, the burden of rural people's communes continues to remain stable. In 1960, the various burdens of rural people's communes will decrease from 5.8% in 1959 to 5.3% of the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations, which is a very beneficial policy for the development of China's agricultural economy.
    Li Xiannian emphasized in his report that more than 80% of the 1960 national budget expenditure is used for economic and cultural construction expenditure, which is an important feature of our national budget. Military expenditure accounts for 57.1% of the US government's budget expenditure for the 1960-1961 fiscal year. In sharp contrast, the proportion of national defense expenditure in China's budget is only 8.3%, and the proportion of national defense expenditure has been decreasing year by year in recent years. This fact fully demonstrates the ardent desire of the Chinese people to engage in peaceful labor and the firm determination to reduce national defense expenditure and accelerate socialist construction; at the same time, it also fully exposes the true face of US imperialism, which is fake peace and real war preparations. Li Xiannian also stated in his report that the distribution of basic construction investment in the 1960 budget further paid attention to the mobilization of local initiative under the unified leadership of the central government, paid attention to the rational arrangement of large, medium, and small enterprises, and strengthened the weak links such as railways, electricity, and non-ferrous metals. At the same time, it also further strengthened the support for agricultural production and people's communes. While supporting the high-speed development of production and construction, the 1960 national budget also actively supports the high-speed development of cultural, educational, health, and scientific undertakings.
    Li Xiannian said that the realization of the national budget is not only a major economic task, but also a major political and mass task. Under the leadership of the Party, we must adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, strive to increase production, practice thrift, and successfully complete the task. He said that the primary task of financial and economic workers is to promote the comprehensive leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. Financial departments must actively and proactively support production, participate in and organize production, and give full play to the role of financial departments in promoting production, ensuring needs, regulating distribution, increasing accumulation, and supporting construction. In industrial and commercial enterprises and basic construction units, it is necessary to actively carry out mass economic accounting movements. In rural people's communes, it is necessary to improve financial management, improve financial systems, practice diligence and thrift in running communes, and in all public institutions and state organs, it is necessary to further implement the principle of practicing thrift, strive to improve work efficiency, save all expenses that can be saved, and oppose corruption and waste.
    Li Xiannian finally called on all state workers, all economic workers, and the people of the whole country to unite and strive to complete and over fulfill the 1960 national budget.
    The reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian were interrupted by thunderous applause from the venue from time to time.
    Today, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress submitted a written work report to the Congress, and the Congress also approved the report of the Credentials Committee on the qualification of the deputies who were elected by-election.
    Today's meeting ended at 6:00 p.m.
    Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China, as well as some foreign guests in Beijing, were invited to attend today's meeting as guests of the Congress.
    Tomorrow - the 31st, the deputies will read the national economic plan and national budget and final account documents and related materials. (Attached pictures)

    国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任李富春，代表国务院向大会作关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告。
    李富春在报告中详细总结了1959年我国发展国民经济的巨大成就和大跃进以来的主要经验，阐述了1960年发展国民经济的方针任务，并且号召全国人民进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，为完成和超额完成今年发展国民经济的计划而奋斗。
    李富春说，1959年，我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续实现了国民经济的大跃进。报告列举的数字表明，1959年我国工农业总产值比大跃进的1958年增长了31．1％，其中，工业总产值比1958年增长39．3％，农业总产值比1958年增长16．7％，国家预算内的基本建设投资总额比1958年增长24．5％，所有经济部门在1959年都继续取得了大跃进的发展速度；科学、教育、文化、体育、卫生事业也都得到了大发展。两年大跃进的结果，已使我国提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。他说，这是我国人民的伟大胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    李富春强调指出，两年的连续大跃进，证明了党中央和毛泽东同志规定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是一个伟大的创造，有着极其丰富的内容。它的出发点是：人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素。李富春说，为了不断地发挥人民群众的积极性，我们遵循了毛泽东同志所阐明的马克思列宁主义关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，不断地合理解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾。根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。他说，当1956年生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利以后，接着在1957年进行了政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命。1958年和1959年在全民所有制的企业和国家机关中，在管理体制、规章制度、劳动关系、领导方法等方面进行了一系列的改革。特别是在社会主义建设中，贯彻执行了一套“两条腿走路”的方针。在一切经济工作中，不断地加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，开展大规模的群众运动。这一切就全面地充分地调动了人民群众的积极性，因而使我国的社会主义建设事业出现了连续大跃进。
    他在谈到这些丰富的经验时，特别指出我国人民公社的发展的重要意义。他说：由于人民群众政治觉悟的提高，由于大跃进形势的开展，我国广大农村实现了人民公社化。这种规模更大、公有化程度更高、工农商学兵相结合、政社合一的人民公社，是加快我国社会主义建设的最好的社会基层组织形式，在将来，是我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制、由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好的组织形式。它进一步地把我国五亿多农民群众的力量调动起来和组织起来。他说，现在，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动。这一切，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造。
    李富春说，1958年和1959年的伟大实践，使我们取得了丰富经验。这些经验告诉我们：在社会主义制度下，用大跃进的速度发展国民经济，是完全可能的。是客观的必然性。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国整个社会主义建设时期的三个法宝，这是毛泽东思想的产物。毛泽东思想的旗帜，就是胜利的旗帜。认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证。
    李富春说，1960年是我国发展社会主义建设事业的极为重要的一年。全国人民努力争取这一年国民经济的继续跃进，就将为第二个五年计划期间以至整个六十年代的连续跃进奠定基础。他说，1960年，我们要更好地贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，在过去两年连续跃进的基础上，争取国民经济全面的更好的跃进。为着实现这个任务，1960年国民经济计划的安排，应当进一步地确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合；应当继续执行工业以钢为纲、农业以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，并且进一步加强运输业、动力工业、采掘工业等部门，以便更加适当地处理重工业、轻工业、农业各部门之间及各部门内部各行各业之间的关系，使国民经济跃进得更好。
    李富春说，农业对于发展国民经济有着极端重要的作用，它是国民经济的基础。加快农业的发展，认真地贯彻实行农业发展纲要四十条，是高速度，按比例地发展我国社会主义计划经济的中心环节。1960年的农业生产应当继续以粮为纲，在保证粮食增产的条件下，全面安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂各类农作物的生产，并且实行农林牧副渔同时并举，争取农业的全面大发展。要把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位，而在畜牧业中又把养猪放在首要地位，这是促进农业全面发展的重要步骤。
    为了更快地发展农业，在1960年，要在进一步发挥人民公社的优越性的同时，积极地推进农业的技术改造，提高农业的劳动生产率。他说，在过去十年中，我国工农联盟经历了两个阶段，即土地改革阶段和合作化阶段。在农村已经实现了人民公社化的条件下，我们应当把工农联盟推进到一个新的阶段，使工业积极支援农业，使农业逐步地建立在现代化的基础上。在农业机械化方面，我们努力的目标是：从1959年起，争取四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决，在十年左右的时间争取在全国范围内基本上实现农业机械化和水利化，并且实现相当程度的电气化。为了促进农业的迅速发展，工业、运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各部门，都要把支援农业当做自己的重要任务。在各部门普遍支援农业中间，重工业负有特别重要的任务。1960年由国家分配的用于制造农业机械和农具的钢材，为一百一十万吨，比1959年增长一倍左右。1960年农业方面将增加机械动力五百多万马力。在这一年机耕面积将达到一亿亩以上，机械灌溉面积将达到二亿亩以上。
    李富春说，1960年将继续进行大规模的基本建设，除了继续注意必要的大型项目的建设以外，工业、交通运输以及各个地方和人民公社，都应当继续积极地发展一批“小洋群”企业和“小土群”企业，同时提高原有的“小洋群”企业和“小土群”企业的生产水平。在有煤有铁的地方，都要积极建立一批新的采煤、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢的“小洋群”企业或“小土群”企业，以带动其他行业的“小洋群”企业和“小土群”企业的发展，并且适应生产建设发展的需要，根据各地自己的可能条件，建设必要数量的小洋铁路或小土铁路。
    李富春副总理接着就重工业，重工业支援农业，农业，轻工业，农村人民公社工业、城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业，交通运输业，商业，劳动工资，科学研究和文教卫生事业等九个方面，对1960年计划指标的安排分别作了说明。1960年的工农业总产值将达到二千九百八十亿元，比1959年增长23％。其中工业总产值二千一百亿元，增长29％；农业总产值八百八十亿元，增长12％。基本建设投资三百二十五亿元（地方和企业自筹的投资约六十亿元不在此数之内），增长21．7％。
    列入今年计划的各项工农业主要产品都有很大增长。钢（不包括土钢）为一千八百四十万吨，增长38％；煤炭四亿二千五百万吨，增长22％；粮食、棉花的产量各增长10％左右。棉纱九百万件，增长9％；棉布七十六亿米，增长1．3％；糖一百三十万吨，增长15％。农村人民公社工业的产值，要比1959年增长50％左右；城市人民公社工业和街道工业的产值，增长一倍左右。各种现代运输工具的货运量要比1959年增长42％。1960年社会商品零售总额比1959年增长14％。1960年工业部门的劳动生产率提高25％左右，职工平均工资拟增加6％。
    李富春在列举了1960年科学研究和文教卫生事业的发展计划后说，各省、市、自治区，各专区和县，在国家计划指导下，都要积极地发展为本地方生产建设服务的中等学校和高等学校。在科学研究事业方面，要动员各方面的力量，努力学习、研究和掌握世界上最新的科学技术成就，总结群众实践的丰富经验，为争取在比较短的时间内实现十二年科学技术规划而奋斗。在文化事业方面，实行“全面规划，积极发展，重点建设，提高质量”的方针，以保证文化事业更好地配合和促进工农业生产的大跃进，为技术革命和文化革命服务，掀起建设社会主义文化的高潮。在卫生事业方面，要继续大力开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的群众卫生运动。继续大力开展城乡的群众性的体育运动。
    李富春指出，1960年国民经济计划是继续跃进的计划，又是经过努力可以完成和超额完成的计划。胜利地实现这个计划，我们就可能争取用比十年更少的时间，在工业主要产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，并且提前实现1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要。
    李富春副总理在报告的最后一部分，详细谈到了我国人民正在开展的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为内容的技术革新和技术革命运动。他说，我国人民征服落后技术的伟大进军，已经在全国范围内开始发动起来了。具有广泛群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，是不断进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、文化革命的必然结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物。这一运动必将加快我国工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的进程，进一步提高社会主义建设的速度，进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和科学技术文化水平。
    李富春说，我们在社会主义建设上已经取得了大跃进的速度，在技术改进上也应当争取大跃进的速度。他号召全国人民把技术革新和技术革命运动更广泛地、更深入地开展起来，使它不断地巩固、发展和提高，使它沿着正确的科学的全民的道路前进。
    国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念，接着作了关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。他说，1959年国家预算的执行情况是良好的。执行结果，收入和支出都超过了1959年4月第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所通过的预算，并且收入大于支出，略有结余。
    李先念说，1959年国家决算收入五百四十一亿六千万元，相当于原预算数五百二十亿一千万元的104．1％。1959年决算收入中，企业和事业收入为原预算的104．9％；各项税收为原预算的102．9％；其他收入为原预算的105．7％。
    1959年国家决算支出五百二十七亿七千万元，相当于原预算五百二十亿一千万元的101．5％。1959年决算支出中，经济建设费三百二十一亿七千万元，为原预算的101．5％；社会文教费五十八亿六千万元，为原预算的102．3％；国防费五十八亿元，为原预算的100％；行政管理费二十九亿元，为原预算的107．7％。此外，还有债务支出九亿七千万元，对外援助支出三亿五千万元，其他支出二亿九千万元，增拨银行信贷资金四十四亿三千万元。
    1959年国家财政收支相抵，结余十三亿九千万元。这些结余是地方预算的结余，连同1958年滚存下来的地方结余十七亿七千万元共为三十一亿六千万元，将由地方结转到1960年安排使用，不列入国家预算。
    李先念指出：在党的八届八中全会关于反右倾鼓干劲的号召下开展起来的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，对于1959年国民经济的大跃进和国家预算的实现起了决定性的作用。他说，经过1959年的继续大跃进，我国国民经济从1958年开始出现的既有高速度又有按比例发展的跃进局面，已经奠定下来了，我国财政工作随着生产的跃进，也进入了一个新的局面。这个新局面的特点是：多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设；合理地节约地使用资金，既保证国民经济的高速度发展，又保持财政收支的平衡。国家财政同整个国民经济一样在第一个五年计划期间本来就是高速度地向前发展的，1958年以来则进入了一个更高速度的连续跃进的新阶段。这表现在财政收入更高速度地增长；基本建设支出的规模更加扩大；建设资金的使用更加合理和节约；财政支出的构成有了进一步的变化。经济建设和文化建设支出在整个财政支出中所占比例，1958年和1959年平均为79．6％，而第一个五年计划期间平均为63．9％；国防费和行政费在整个财政支出中所占比例，1958年和1959年平均为17％，而第一个五年计划期间平均为30．9％。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会第一次会议关于第二个五年计划的建议中曾经提出在第二个五年中，必须使经济文化建设支出的比重提高到60％到70％，使军费和行政管理费用的比重下降到20％左右，这个要求，已经提前三年，并且更好地实现了。
    李先念接着报告了1960年国家预算的安排。他指出这个预算草案是根据1960年国民经济持续跃进的要求编制的。这是一个加速发展工业、大力支援农业和积极发展文化教育科学事业的预算，也是一个瞻前顾后，既积极而又可靠的预算。他说，1960年国家预算收入七百亿二千万元，预算支出七百亿二千万元，收支平衡。同1959年决算比较，收入增长29．3％，支出增长32．7％，这和国民经济计划草案所规定的工农业生产增长的指标是基本上适应的。
    李先念具体说明了1960年国家预算各类收入和支出情况。他说，1960年国家预算收入中，全民所有制的国营企业的缴款，包括利润和税收为六百五十四亿三千万元，占预算收入总数的93．4％。1960年国家预算收入的增长绝大部分是来自国营经济缴款的增加，这是我国财政基础固若磐石的一个重要标志。尽管农业生产连年跃进，但是农村人民公社的负担仍然继续保持稳定。1960年农村人民公社的各项负担，占农副业总产值的比例，将从1959年的5．8％下降到5．3％，这是对于发展我国农业经济极为有利的一种政策。
    李先念在报告中强调指出：1960年国家预算支出80％以上用于经济和文化建设的开支，这是我们国家预算的重要特点。美国政府1960年——1961年度的预算支出中军费占57．1％，同这种情况根本相反，我国预算支出中国防费所占的比重只有8．3％，而且国防费的比重几年来是逐年降低的。这个事实充分说明了我国人民从事和平劳动的热烈愿望和节减国防经费加速社会主义建设的坚强决心；同时，也充分揭露了美帝国主义假和平、真备战的本来面目。李先念在报告中还说明，1960年预算支出中对于基本建设投资的分配，进一步注意了在中央统一领导下地方积极性的发挥，注意了大中小型企业的合理安排和铁道、电力、有色金属等薄弱环节的加强。同时也进一步加强了对农业生产和人民公社的支援。1960年国家预算在支持高速度发展生产建设的同时，还积极支持文教卫生和科学事业的高速度发展。
    李先念说，实现国家预算不仅是一项重大的经济工作，而且是一项重大的政治工作和群众工作，必须在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，努力增加生产，厉行节约，才能胜利地完成任务。他说，财政经济工作者的首要任务是促进工农业生产的全面跃进。财政部门必须积极主动地支援生产。参与和组织生产，充分发挥财政部门在促进生产、保证需要、调剂分配、增加积累、支援建设等方面的作用。在工商企业和基建单位要积极开展群众性经济核算运动，在农村人民公社要改善财务管理，健全财务制度，实行勤俭办社，在一切事业单位和国家机关要进一步执行厉行节约的原则，努力提高工作效率，节约一切可以节约的开支，反对贪污浪费。
    李先念最后号召全体国家工作人员、全体经济工作人员和全国人民一致行动起来，为完成和超额完成1960年国家预算而奋斗。
    李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，不时被会场雷鸣般的掌声所打断。
