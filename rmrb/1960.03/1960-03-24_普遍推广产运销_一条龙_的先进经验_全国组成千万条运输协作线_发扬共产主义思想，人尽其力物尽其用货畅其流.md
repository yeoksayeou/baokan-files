Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, the "one-stop" transportation collaboration experience created by workers at Qinhuangdao Port and railway station in Hebei Province more than half a year ago has been fully promoted throughout the country. Currently, on the transportation lines from railways to highways, water transport to land transport, trunk lines to branch lines, and long-distance to short-distance, tens of millions of "one-stop" collaborative transportation lines have been formed. These are playing a huge role in accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships, improving freight speed, and promoting the leap forward in production and construction.

The "one-stop" transportation collaboration involves comprehensive cooperation between production, supply, transportation, and sales departments, between various modes of transportation, and between various links within the transportation departments. It forms an advanced transportation line that is interconnected, closely linked, and accelerates direct delivery from the origin of the goods to the destination. It reduces or eliminates non-productive downtime of vehicles and ships during freight transport, achieving the goals of fast loading, fast transportation, fast unloading, and fast handling, completing transportation tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner.

According to statistics, the national railways have already organized one thousand such collaborative transportation lines, many of which guarantee the transportation of key materials such as coal, ore, steel, grain, and timber. In the coastal areas of the South and North, and on major inland river shipping routes such as the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, more than one hundred collaborative transportation lines of water-land combined transport and river-sea combined transport have also been organized. In Liaoning Province, crisscrossed by railways, the railway trunk lines have basically formed a collaborative transportation network, and a new train operation diagram has been implemented according to the requirements of the collaborative transportation lines. The approximately eight thousand collaborative transportation lines organized by Hebei Province connect the vast majority of factories, mines, and many people's communes in the province; Sichuan Province has launched a "ten thousand dragons movement" in cities and villages. These colorful "one-stop" collaborative transportation lines in various regions mainly take the following forms: "one-stop" transportation lines for railway and waterway trunk lines; short-distance "one-stop" transportation lines in a region mainly based on highways and inland rivers; "one-stop" loading and unloading lines in a city area centered on stations and ports; "one-stop" transportation lines within factories and mining enterprises.

The vigorous promotion of "one-stop" transportation collaboration in various regions has tapped a large amount of transportation potential and powerfully promoted the development of production and construction. More than ninety years ago, Marx wrote in "Das Kapital," "Simple cooperation can also produce great results." This great prediction of his has been fully proven by the enormous effect of the "one-stop" transportation collaboration. In February of this year, the average turnover time of freight cars nationwide was 0.15 days shorter than in the first half of 1959 before the "one-stop" transportation collaboration was launched. The increased transportation capacity due to the accelerated vehicle turnover is equivalent to loading more than 1,600 more cars and transporting more than 70,000 tons of goods per day. The navigation rate of cargo ships directly under the Ministry of Communications also increased from about 40% in the first half of 1959 to over 48%. In Anshan Iron and Steel, because this kind of large-scale collaboration has connected the transportation inside and outside the factory into a whole, the coal transported from Fushun to Anshan Iron and Steel can be transported directly from the coal mine pit to the car dumper next to the Anshan Iron and Steel blast furnace, and the total transportation time is halved compared with the past. Nearly four hundred trains transporting raw materials with fixed time, fixed route, fixed quantity, and fixed variety have been organized on the railway transportation lines inside the Anshan Iron and Steel plant area, ensuring steel production. On the transportation line dedicated to transporting "general merchandise" from Shanghai via Qinhuangdao to Qiqihar, the entire water and land transportation process has been shortened from 25 days to seven days because the vehicles and ships are properly matched for transshipment and the goods are not unloaded to the ground. Four people's communes, including Fanshan People's Commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province, broke down the boundaries of the communes and jointly carried out "one-stop" transportation collaboration between communes. They unified the deployment of transportation capacity of several communes, rationally organized the sources of goods, implemented relay transportation, eliminated empty vehicles, reversed the situation of long-term accumulation of materials, and also increased the sideline income of the communes.

Recently, the staff of the industrial and transportation departments of Leshan Prefecture in Sichuan have created an experience of joint contracted production and contracted transportation "one-stop" collaboration, making the transportation work more closely integrated with production. Their approach is: with four steel plants as the core, they organized the four departments of steel, coal, mining, and transportation to jointly carry out large-scale collaboration and competition to achieve high steel production. As a result, the average daily pig iron production in Leshan Prefecture increased from more than 800 tons to more than 1,100 tons; the daily output of car tons for automobile transportation increased by 24% compared with the highest month of last year; the mooring time of wooden boats was also shortened by two-thirds; and a new situation of leap forward in production and transportation has emerged.

"One-stop" transportation collaboration has not only promoted the development of transportation and production, but also greatly promoted communist ideology in the production, supply, transportation, and sales departments. On the tens of millions of collaborative transportation lines, the noble style of "leaving difficulties to oneself and sending convenience to others" is popular everywhere. In order to ensure that the "one-stop" transportation line is transported in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, many loading and unloading workers propose "vehicles arrive, people are present, and goods are ready" to ensure fast loading and unloading; the staff of the transportation department try their best to load more and transport faster, racing against time; the production workers of factories and mining enterprises also propose "all people are of one mind to protect the red 'dragon'," and strive to increase production and transport more. The "Peace No. 55" ship sailing between Shanghai and Qingdao has created a miracle of traveling back and forth between Shanghai and Qingdao seven times a month due to the large-scale collaboration between ports and ships, and the fastest voyage only took ninety-eight hours.

    普遍推广产运销“一条龙”的先进经验
    全国组成千万条运输协作线
    发扬共产主义思想，人尽其力物尽其用货畅其流
    据新华社23日讯　新华社记者报道：半年多以前，河北省秦皇岛港口和铁路车站职工所创造的“一条龙”运输大协作的经验，已经在全国各地全面推广。目前，从铁路到公路、水运到陆运、干线到支线、长途到短途的交通运输线上，组成了千千万万条“一条龙”协作运输线，对于加速车船周转、提高货运速度和促进生产建设事业的跃进，正在发挥着巨大的作用。
    “一条龙”运输大协作，就是通过生产、供应、运输、销售各部门之间、各种不同运输工具之间以及运输部门内部各个环节之间的全面协作，从货物的产地到销地，组成一线相连、环环紧扣、加速直达的先进运输线；减少或消灭货运途中车船的非生产停留时间，达到快装、快运、快卸、快搬的目的，多快好省地完成运输任务。
    据统计，全国铁路已经组织了一千条这样的协作运输线，其中许多是保证煤炭、矿石、钢铁、粮食、木材等重点物资的运输线。在南方和北方沿海，长江、珠江等内河航运干线上，也组织了一百多条水陆联运、江海联运的协作运输线。铁路纵横交错的辽宁省，铁路干线已经基本上形成为一个协作运输网，并且根据协作运输线的要求实行了新的列车运行图。河北省组成的约八千条协作运输线，联系着全省绝大部分工厂、矿山和许多人民公社；四川省在城市和农村，开展了“万龙运动”。各地这些丰富多彩的“一条龙”协作运输线，主要的形式是：铁路、水路干线的“一条龙”运输线；以公路内河为主的一个地区的短途“一条龙”运输线；以车站、港口为中心的一个市区范围内的“一条龙”装卸搬运线；厂矿企业内部的“一条龙”运输线。
    各地大力推行“一条龙”运输大协作的结果，挖掘出了大量的运输潜力，并有力地促进了生产、建设事业的发展。九十多年前，马克思在“资本论”中写道：“简单的协作，也可以生出伟大的结果来。”他的这一伟大预言已经为“一条龙”运输大协作的巨大效果所充分证明。今年2月份，全国货车平均周转时间，比开展“一条龙”运输大协作以前的1959年上半年，缩短了零点一五天，由于车辆周转加快所增加的运力，等于每天多装一千六百多辆车，多运七万多吨货物。交通部直属江海货运船舶的航行率，也由1959年上半年的40％左右提高为48％以上。在鞍钢，由于这种大协作把厂内厂外的运输连成了一个整体，从抚顺运进鞍钢的煤，可以从煤矿坑口一直运到鞍钢高炉旁的翻车机卸车，全程运输时间比过去缩短了一半。鞍钢厂区内部的铁路运输线上，组织了近四百条定时、定线、定量、定品种的运输原材料的列车，保证了钢铁生产。从上海经过秦皇岛到齐齐哈尔的一条专运“百货”的运输线上，由于做到了车船对口换装，货不落地，水陆运输全程由过去的二十五天缩短到了七天。河北省怀来县矾山等四个人民公社，打破了社界，联合起来，大搞公社与公社之间的“一条龙”运输大协作，对几个公社的运力进行统一调度，合理组织货源，实行接力运输，消灭了车辆空驶，扭转了物资长期积压的局面，还增加了公社的副业收入。
    最近，四川乐山专区工业、交通部门的职工，又创造了一种联合包产、包运“一条龙”大协作的经验，使运输工作和生产更加紧密地结合起来。他们的作法是：以四个钢铁厂为核心，组织了钢铁、煤炭、矿山和交通四个部门，共同为实现生铁高产，开展大协作和竞赛。这样，乐山专区每天平均的生铁产量，由原来的八百多吨提高到了一千一百多吨；汽车运输的车吨日产量，比去年最高的月份还提高了24％；木船停港时间也缩短了三分之二；出现了生产运输跃进的新局面。
    “一条龙”运输大协作不仅促进了运输和生产的发展，而且在生产、供应、运输和销售部门大大发扬了共产主义思想。在千千万万条协作运输线上，到处流行着“把困难留给自己、把方便送给别人”的崇高风尚。为了保证“一条龙”运输线运得又多又快又好又省，许多装卸工人提出“车到人有货现成”，保证快装快卸；运输部门的职工们千方百计地多装快运、分秒必争；厂矿企业的生产工人也提出“万众一心保红‘龙’”，努力增产多运。上海、青岛间航行的“和平五五号”轮，就是由于港湾、船舶之间的大协作，创造了一个月在上海、青岛间往返七次的奇迹，其中最快的一个航次只用了九十八个小时。
