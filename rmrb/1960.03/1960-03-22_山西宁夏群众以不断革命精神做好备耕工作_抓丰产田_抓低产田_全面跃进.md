(Reported by this newspaper) In the roaring wave of drought resistance, farmers in various parts of Shanxi are tensely and joyfully starting the spring sowing season ahead of schedule.

Currently, from the Taihang Mountains and the Jinnan Plain in the south, to the Great Wall inside and outside Jinbei in the north, the vanguard battle of spring sowing – sowing of spring wheat, millet, sunflower, and hemp – has been generally launched. This year, various places are vigorously resisting drought and seizing moisture to sow, and the sowing date is one solar term earlier than in previous years. The sown area has reached 800,000 mu.

The situation of spring sowing work in Shanxi Province this year is very good, and the material preparation is more abundant than in any previous year. Under the slogan of "One year of farming, two years of preparation," a large-scale spring plowing movement with water conservancy, pig raising, deep plowing, and land preparation as the main content was launched throughout the province from November last year. The spring preparation work was 40 to 50 days earlier than in previous years, thus greatly winning time, gaining the initiative, and achieving excellent results. The autumn plowing area in the province reached 95% of the area that should be cultivated, more than double that of the previous year, and the depth generally increased. Through vigorously grasping the accumulation of fertilizer centered on pig raising, the province has now exceeded the winter-spring fertilizer accumulation plan by 8.6%. Seeds have long been prepared throughout the province, and Fanshi, Wenshui, Xinding, and other counties have held mass seed competition meetings. The province has treated more than 13 million mu of stubble roots and frozen more than 70% of the cotton seeds, so the density of pests and diseases this spring is half that of previous years. Tool reforms in various places are closely combined with the production season, with 500,000 newly added or improved tools and 1.5 million small farm tools supplemented. In addition, to meet the new requirements of agricultural production this year, various places have widely carried out technical training. In cotton alone, various places have trained 130,000 technical backbones and relied on this force to teach more than 1.6 million commune members cotton planting techniques.

A new thing that marks Shanxi Province's agricultural production entering a new stage is the large-scale development of high-yield squares, ridges, and ditches. As of now, the high-yield area in the province has reached 16.57 million mu, accounting for 26.7% of the province's cultivated land. This year, Shanxi Province further implemented the policy of multiple planting and multiple harvests and high yield and multiple harvests, and clearly put forward the measures of grasping three fields (high-yield fields, low-yield fields, and returning fields), and grasping high-yield squares and general fields together, so the preparation work for all types of cultivated land has been fully developed and is all good. Jinbei Prefecture, which has a vast land area, has newly expanded cultivated land by 3 million mu this year.

Shanxi Province's preparation work is all good, everything is good, and one step ahead leads to initiative in every step. The biggest threat to production at present is the widespread drought in the province. The Jinnan area has basically had no thorough rain since October last year. However, the Shanxi farmers, who are historically rich in drought resistance experience, and the people's communes that have been tested by the special drought last year and achieved a bumper harvest, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a mass movement of resisting drought when there is drought and preventing drought when there is no drought since the drought just started to appear. With the development of the drought, a production movement to create conditions for spring sowing from all aspects and to conquer the drought demon has entered a new climax. The spring irrigation area in the province is constantly expanding, and the daily irrigation progress in Jin Southeast Prefecture has increased from 22,400 mu to 51,000 mu. Jinbei area grasps both large and small water sources, blocking rivers, dams water, digging springs, and carrying water, and has now spring irrigated 2 million mu of cultivated land. In the spring production movement, Party committees at all levels adhere to the principle of putting politics in command and vigorously grasping political and ideological education. Wang Qian, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, personally led responsible cadres from various places to conduct cross-check mobile on-site meetings for spring production. The biggest feature of this provincial-level inspection is starting with political and ideological education. After the drought occurred, some cadres and commune members lacked the due assessment and correct understanding of the drought situation. In some areas, drought resistance work was not well mobilized. In response to these situations, Party committees at all levels, on the one hand, criticized paralysis and inertia, and on the other hand, organized the masses to take countermeasures against drought resistance and drought prevention. Some communes clearly put forward the idea that relying on the sky for production is the idea of lazy people and cowards, and stimulated the commune members' fighting spirit against natural disasters. Because ideological work this year has been fully mobilized, the fighting atmosphere of people's communes in various places to win the battle against drought is getting stronger and stronger, and a new situation of a good start in preserving moisture, resisting drought, and spring planting has emerged this year.

(Reported by this newspaper) A mass movement with grain as the key link, expanding planting area, developing low-yield to high-yield, high-yield to higher-yield, alkaline land to fertile land, and dry land to paddy field, has been formed in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

In this movement, Party committees at all levels in the Autonomous Region educated cadres and the masses with the spirit of continuous revolution, and delegated a large number of cadres to strengthen the leadership of the forefront of production and weak teams. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, people of all ethnic groups are full of energy, catching up with the season and seizing time, striving to take the initiative in everything, so that a good situation of being early in everything and taking the initiative in every step has emerged in the agricultural production front of the region this year. More than 5,000 large and small canal projects and drainage ditch network projects have been completed in the mountainous areas and irrigation areas, so that the 14 large and medium-sized reservoirs just built in the arid mountainous areas last year can play the role of irrigation and ensure that 500,000 mu of farmland are irrigated. In the Ningxia Plain in the Yellow River irrigation area, nearly 100 kilometers of simple canal projects of the Yellow River Qingtongxia West Main Canal have been completed, laying the foundation for expanding planting area in the large-scale land reclamation under the Helan Mountains this year. The fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movement in the region completed 80% of the annual fertilizer demand shortly after the Spring Festival, and the quality was generally improved. This year, the region plans to expand the area of summer crops by 530,000 mu and the area of cash crops by 230,000 mu. One million mu of spring wheat in 12 counties and cities in the Yellow River irrigation area was sown 10 days to half a month earlier than in previous years, and the sown area was expanded by 200,000 mu compared with last year. Because the task of spring wheat sowing has progressed early, quickly, and well, in addition to freeing up their hands to sow hemp, oil crops, sugar beets, cotton and other cash crops and preparing for summer plowing and summer planting, the people's communes have also transferred a part of the labor force to the mass movement of large-scale spring repair of drainage ditches and soil improvement. In the arid mountainous areas in the south, members of all ethnic groups launched a drought resistance movement of harrowing, rolling, storing water, and preserving moisture two months ago. Therefore, although there has been little rain and snow in Ningxia this winter and spring, most of the summer fields have basically reached the point where the soil is moist and the fertilizer is sufficient, ensuring that planting is not delayed.

At present, the counties in the mountainous areas have sown more than 1.1 million mu of wheat, accounting for more than 60% of the sowing plan.

The mass movement of turning low-yield into high-yield and high-yield into higher-yield is manifested in the meticulous and comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and the improvement of cultivation techniques. The "Three Million" movement launched throughout the region this year, which consists of reclaiming and planting one million mu, developing one million mu of small and large-scale terraced fields, and building one million mu of large drainage ditch networks, has now completed 800,000 mu of small and large-scale terraced fields. These terraced fields generally have flat land, straight ridges, and irrigation and drainage. Guyuan Prefecture in the southern mountainous area is rich in oil crops, and the annual planting of oil crops accounts for more than 80% of the region's oil crop planting area. However, due to the past extensive cultivation, the yield of oil crops was not high. This year, the Guyuan Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China summed up the experience of the masses in planting oil crops for many years and put forward the "Eight Major Reforms" to vow to win a bumper harvest of oil crops this year, which greatly changed the past extensive cultivation habits.

In order to realize various innovations in agricultural production and improve the level of cultivation technology, the region trained 100,000 agricultural technicians before spring sowing, formulated cultivation technical regulations such as rational close planting, widely carried out soil application and seed dressing and seed soaking, and promoted more than 100,000 pieces of spring farming tools, which greatly improved cultivation technology and improved labor efficiency.

    山西宁夏群众以不断革命精神做好备耕工作
    抓丰产田　抓低产田　全面跃进
    本报讯　在轰轰烈烈的抗旱声浪中，山西各地农民紧张、欢乐地提早揭开春播序幕。
    目前，南起太行山区、晋南平原，北至晋北长城内外，春季播种的前哨战——春小麦、谷子、向日葵、大麻播种工作已经普遍展开。今年各地大力抗旱抢墒下种，播种日期比往年提早了一个节令。播种面积已达八十万亩。
    山西省今年春播工作形势非常良好，物质准备比任何一年都雄厚。在“一年庄稼二年闹”的口号下，从去年11月全省就以水利、养猪、深耕、整地为主要内容展开了大规模的备耕运动。备耕工作比往年提前了四十天到五十天，因而大大地赢得了时间，取得了主动，做出了优异的成绩。全省秋耕面积达到了应耕面积的95％，超过上年一倍，深度普遍有了增加。经过大抓以养猪为中心的积肥工作，目前全省已超过了去冬今春积肥计划8．6％。全省种子，早已准备就绪，繁峙、文水、忻定等县并举行了群众性的赛种大会。全省已处理根茬一千三百多万亩，把70％多的棉籽进行了冷冻，因此今春病虫害的密度比往年减少了一半。各地工具改革与生产季节紧密结合，新增加改良工具达五十万件，增补小农具一百五十万件。此外，适应今年农业生产新的要求，各地广泛地开展了技术训练，仅棉花一项，各地即训练了十三万技术骨干，并依靠这批力量向一百六十多万社员传授植棉技术。
    标志着山西省农业生产跨进新阶段的新生事物，是大搞丰产方、梁、沟，截止目前全省丰产方面积已达一千六百五十七万亩，占全省耕地的26．7％。山西省今年在进一步贯彻多种多收和高产多收两条腿走路的方针中，明确地提出了抓三田（丰产田、低产田、回茬田）的措施，丰产方和一般田一起抓，因而各类耕地备耕工作全面发展、全面好。土地广阔的晋北专区今年还新扩大耕地三百万亩。
    山西省备耕工作是一项好、项项好，一步赶先、步步主动。当前生产上的最大威胁是全省普遍性的干旱现象，晋南地区从去年10月间开始到现在基本上没降透雨。但是历史上富有抗旱经验的山西农民，和经历去年特大旱灾获得丰收的考验的人民公社，在党的领导下从旱象刚一露头起就展开了有旱抗旱，无旱防旱的群众运动。随着旱象的发展，一个从各个方面为春播创造条件的征服旱魔的生产运动，进入了一个新的高潮。全省春浇面积不断扩大，晋东南专区灌溉日进度由二万二千四百亩增加到五万一千亩。晋北地区大水小水一齐抓，见河就拦，见水就堵，见泉就挖，见水就担，目前全区已春浇耕地二百万亩。在春季生产运动中，各级党委坚持贯彻政治挂帅，大抓政治思想教育。中共山西省委书记王谦同志亲自带领各地负责干部进行了春季生产交叉检查流动现场会议。这次全省性的大检查，最大的特点是从政治思想教育入手。旱象发生以后，部分干部、社员对旱情形势缺乏应有的估计和正确的认识。某些地区抗旱工作没有很好的动起来，各级党委针对这些情况，一面批判麻痹思想，一面组织群众采取抗旱防旱对策。有些公社明确提出了靠天生产是懒汉懦夫思想，激发社员与自然灾害的斗志。由于今年思想工作发动充分，因此各地人民公社抗旱必胜的战斗气氛越来越浓，今年保墒抗旱春种一开始就出现了旗开得胜的新局面。
    本报讯　一个以粮为纲，扩大种植面积，开展低产变高产、高产更高产、碱地变良田、旱田变水田的群众运动，已经在宁夏回族自治区形成。
    自治区各级党委在这一运动中，都以不断革命精神教育干部和群众，并下放大批干部加强生产第一线和薄弱队的领导。在各级党委的领导下，各族人民干劲十足，赶节令、抢时间，事事争取主动，使今年全区农业生产战线上一开始就出现一早百早、步步主动的大好形势。山区和川区兴修和整修大小五千多条渠道工程和排水沟网工程已经完成，使干旱山区去年刚修成的十四座大中小型水库，能够发挥灌溉效益，保证五十万亩农田得到灌溉。在黄河灌区的宁夏平原完成近百公里的黄河青铜峡西总干渠简易渠道工程，为今年在贺兰山下大面积的垦荒扩大种植面积打下了基础。全区积肥、造肥运动，在春节后不久就完成全年需肥量的80％，而且质量普遍提高。今年全区夏田作物面积计划扩大五十三万亩，经济作物面积扩大二十三万亩。黄河灌区十二个县市百万亩春小麦比往年提前十天到半月播种完毕，播种面积比去年扩大了二十万亩。由于春小麦播种任务进展得早、快、好，各人民公社除了腾出手来提早播种麻、油料、甜菜、棉花等经济作物和夏耕夏种的备耕工作外，已有一部分劳动力转入春季大修排水沟和改良土壤的群众运动。在南部干旱山区，各族社员两个月前就开展耙耱、磙压、蓄水、保墒的抗旱运动。因此，去冬今春宁夏地区虽然雨雪稀少，但是大部分夏田都基本上达到墒保肥足，保证了不误农时播种。
    现在山区各县已抗旱播种小麦一百一十多万亩，占到播种计划的60％以上。
    低产变高产，高产更高产的群众运动，表现在细致和全面地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，改进耕作技术。全区掀起的今年垦荒种植百万亩，大搞大系小畦园田化百万亩，大修排水沟网化百万亩的“三百万”运动，到现在已完成了大系小畦园田八十万亩，这些园田一般都达到地平埂直，有灌有排。南部山区的固原专区盛产油料，每年种植油料作物占全区油料种植面积的80％以上。但是由于过去耕作粗放，油料产量不高。今年中共固原地委总结了群众多年来种植油料作物的经验，提出了誓夺今年油料大丰收的“八大改革”，大大改变了已往耕作粗放的习惯。
    为了实现农业生产的各种革新和提高耕作技术水平，全区在春播前训练了十万人的农业技术员，制订了合理密植等耕作技术规程，广泛进行了土壤施药和拌种、浸种工作，推广春耕工具十万多件，大大改进了耕作技术和提高了劳动效率。
