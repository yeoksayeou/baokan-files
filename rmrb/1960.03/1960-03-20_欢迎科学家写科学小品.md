    Welcome Scientists to Write Popular Science Articles
    On February 28th, this newspaper opened the column "Uses of Mathematics" on page eight, and published a popular science article by Comrade Hua Luogeng entitled "How to Calculate Leaf Area." Many readers have written to express their welcome, believing that the principles are explained in a simple and profound way, providing simple calculation methods that are also very applicable and helpful to rural workers and village teachers. Readers hope that other scientists can also write popular science articles for the newspaper that are both accessible and relevant to current work.

    欢迎科学家写科学小品
    2月28日本报八版辟了“数学的用场”一栏，发表了华罗庚同志的一篇科学小品“怎样计算叶面积”。不少读者来信表示欢迎，认为道理讲得深入浅出，提供了简易的计算方法，也很适用，对农村工作者和乡村教师都有帮助。读者希望其他科学家也能为报纸写通俗的、结合当前工作的科学小品。
