The Female Hero Who Started From Scratch
    Guo Jian

    Speaking of Sun Jinglan, the director of the Hongqi Refractory Material Factory, almost every woman in Shenyang knows her. She is a red banner for women running industries and a female hero who started from scratch.

          Where there's a will, there's a way
    In the early summer of 1958, more than a dozen women from the Sixth Residents' Committee of Dashizi Street, Dadong District, Shenyang City, gathered together for a heated discussion.

      "Socialist construction is making great leaps forward everywhere. Can we stay at home in peace?" The young Sun Jinglan looked anxiously at her sisters.

    "We can't stay at home, we should also contribute to socialism!" Wu Rongzhen, Fan Suxian, Li Shuhua, and others answered eagerly. Yes, they should step out of their homes and participate in the great socialist construction, but what should they do? They thought about it and thought about it, and then it occurred to them: sewing and washing are women's strengths, so let's set up a sewing and washing team! They brought washing basins, soap boxes, needles, and thread from their homes, and the sign for the sewing and washing team was also hung up. However, because housewives had not yet participated in social production at that time, finding work became a problem, and the sewing and washing team "closed down" in less than a month. "Let's knit sweaters!" someone suggested, but there was still not much work to do. After two failures, some people lost heart and said, "Running a factory is not something old women can do; it's impossible!" Sun Jinglan still refused to admit defeat. She tossed her short hair and said decisively, "Where there's a will, there's a way. What's there to fear about difficulties?" She also patiently explained to the dispirited sisters, "The whole country is making great leaps forward. Can we sit at home and wait for others to build socialism?" This improved and unified everyone's understanding, and the group persisted and did not "disband."

    Difficulties can only scare away the timid. Sun Jinglan and the others were not intimidated by difficulties. Instead, they became more determined to run a factory. After visiting the Shenhe District Small Hardware Factory, their enthusiasm grew even more! Large machine tools could not be produced for the time being, but small commodities such as hairpins and buttons could always be produced, and these were also needed for people's lives!

    To start a factory, there must be factory buildings. Everyone looked around and found two dilapidated chicken coops. The houses could be used, but they were too dirty. Sun Jinglan looked at everyone and said, "Let's clean them up." She took off her shoes and jumped in first. Everyone followed closely and gave it a thorough cleaning. Now that they had the buildings, what about the equipment? Everyone brought axes, hammers, kitchen knives... from their homes, and Sun Jinglan went everywhere to borrow "presses." The Shenhe District Small Hardware Factory agreed to support the women with four "presses," but they needed a letter of introduction from the government.

    Sun Jinglan found the Party branch secretary, who, after listening to her account of starting the factory, immediately wrote a letter of introduction and said to her, "Running a factory is a good thing. You must rely on the masses. Come to me if you have any difficulties, and we will study them together." Sun Jinglan felt warm in her heart, both happy and excited, and tears finally filled her eyes.

    Getting orders was the key to whether the factory could start operating. Sun Jinglan left early and returned late every day, running to almost every factory. She couldn't bear to spend money on transportation, so she walked. Her spirit of not being afraid of difficulties and her good desire to contribute to the socialist mansion moved the staff of the Hardware Company, and in the end, they gave them part of the task of stripping steel wires. The factory started operating. The women, who had been revolving around the cooking stove for many years, became workers from this day on. Their happiness was indescribable, and they all worked selflessly.

            Ambitious Aspirations
    After the Party put forward the call to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry, it aroused Sun Jinglan and the others' ambitious aspirations. They wondered: Could we serve the steel marshal? They decided to set up a refractory material factory. Sun Jinglan visited Technician Zhang at the steel brick factory. Technician Zhang smiled and said, "It's a good thing to support the marshal's ascent, and I can help. However, it's not simple! Building a refractory kiln requires 50,000 refractory bricks..." What to do? After some discussion, the women decided to use green bricks to build a large kiln and use a mixture of soil, sand, and lime instead of cement. But where to get so many bricks? After research, some dismantled their two-door fireplaces; some tore down decorative walls; some even dug up the brick floor in their own homes. With everyone contributing, within two days, 50,000 bricks were neatly stacked in the factory yard. They didn't have sand, so they used local materials and dug in the yard. When they dug down eight or nine feet, they could no longer throw the soil up with shovels, so they used their aprons to hoist it up. Once the raw materials were gathered, they invited two knowledgeable people and began to build the large kiln.

    During the construction of the large kiln, Sun Jinglan, Fan Sumei, Mu Suchun, and others worked on scaffolding more than ten meters high to build the chimney; braving wind and rain, they worked hard day and night. When they were really sleepy, they danced a Yangko to refresh themselves. When they couldn't find suitable tools, they mixed mud with their feet; when they couldn't find trowels, they smeared plaster with their hands; when they got hurt, they applied some medicine and continued working. They rebuilt when they broke it down. No one was discouraged, and no one looked distressed.

    When transporting materials, Sun Jinglan and the others borrowed a large cart from the rubber-wheeled cart cooperative and transported it back from Tiexi at night when others were resting. From Tiexi District to Sun Jinglan's factory, the round trip was fifty li, and each cart carried more than two tons of materials. They walked and rested. Sun Jinglan pulled the cart and didn't know how many times her hands and feet were broken. She endured the pain and encouraged everyone to overcome the difficulty of transporting materials. Two old bricklayers were moved by their hard work and said: We are only in our sixties, and we can still work for socialism for a while. They asked to stay and work as workers. From then on, the factory had male workers for the first time.

    Sun Jinglan and women like Guan Weiming also learned how to fire the kiln and watch the fire. They stayed by the kiln day and night. They cheered when they succeeded and cried when they produced waste products. The Party organization found that they had technical difficulties and transferred a technician from the Zhaoxin Factory. This technician also stayed by the kiln with them day and night. When others advised him to rest, he said, "In the past, I never cried when I produced waste products, which shows that your dedication is stronger than mine. I have to learn from you."

            Lofty Style
    Sun Jinglan and the dozen or so housewives, like a blazing torch, ignited a high tide of vigorously developing factories everywhere. In less than half a year, they established small hardware, refractory material, and casting factories, and 348 housewives participated in production. They loved the factory more than their homes and did not leave the factory after work. If they were chased back to rest, they would leave through the front door and sneak back in through the back door; if they were chased away from the drying workshop, they would go to the crushing workshop to work. They moved their own stoves to the factory, and some brought teapots and teacups given by relatives and friends at their weddings for everyone to use. Tables, chairs, water tanks, water buckets... The factory's possessions grew day by day, and no one knew who brought them. When asked, no one would admit it. When the factory lacked fuel, they brought their own coal to burn; on rainy days, the women rushed to cover the products with their own quilts. They never cared about their own things, but they carefully calculated every penny of the factory's money. In order to make a few aprons and a quilt for overnight stays, Sun Jinglan led everyone to discuss it several times. In the end, no one agreed to spend money, and everyone wanted to find their own solutions. When Sun Jinglan went to Beijing last year to attend the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction for Youth, she refused to buy a sleeper berth. She even used her own money to buy a train ticket to Tangshan to learn production technology during the meeting breaks.

    When other residents' committees also wanted to set up factories, Sun Jinglan and the women she led took the initiative to hand over all the small hardware factory and casting factory, which they had painstakingly built, without any compensation. They said: If everyone runs factories, there will be more people and more strength, which will accelerate socialist construction even more!

    Sun Jinglan is now the director of the Hongqi Refractory Material Factory. Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the General Line, the refractory material factory has developed at a high speed. The factory buildings have expanded from the original two rooms to forty-eight rooms; there was only one small hand-operated "press" originally, but now there are twenty machines of various sizes; the number of workers has increased from the original thirteen to three hundred today; the products have also expanded from the past only producing refractory bricks to now producing more than seventy products; the monthly output value has increased from 200 yuan to 50,000 yuan (100,000 yuan including external processing). Among the products they produce, except for four kinds of industrial ceramics, all the rest are civilian products. Since the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy was launched this year, not only are the production targets rising day by day, but the labor conditions have also been greatly improved. From the crushing and forming to the firing workshop, mechanization and semi-mechanization have been achieved. Through the in-depth development of technical performance competitions, more than 80% of the women have reached the technical level of sixth- or seventh-grade workers in state-owned factories.

    Sun Jinglan, a year ago, was still an ordinary housewife. Because she resolutely listened to the Party's words, underwent severe tests in the crucible of vigorously developing industry, and rapidly improved her communist consciousness, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China at the end of 1958 and became a vanguard fighter of the working class.

    白手起家的女英雄
    郭健
    提起红旗耐火器材厂厂长孙景兰，在沈阳市的妇女中几乎无人不知，无人不晓。她是妇女办工业的一面红旗，也是白手起家的女英雄。
          天下无难事
    1958年夏初，沈阳市大东区大什字街第六居民委员会十多名妇女，凑在一块儿热烈的讨论开了。
      “社会主义建设处处都在大跃进，咱们呆在家里能安心吗？”年轻的孙景兰焦急地看着姐妹们。
    “不能呆在家里，咱也应该为社会主义添砖盖瓦呀！”吴荣珍、范素贤、李淑华等，都争先回答。对，应该走出家庭，参加伟大的社会主义建设，可是干啥好呢？她们左核计、右核计，有了，缝缝洗洗是妇女的拿手，就成立个缝洗小组吧！她们从家里拿来洗衣盆、肥皂盒和针头线脑的，缝洗小组的牌子也挂出去了。可是因为当时家庭妇女还没有参加社会生产，揽活成了问题，缝洗小组没坚持一个月就“关板”了。“咱们织毛衣吧！”有人这样提议，可是仍然没多少活干。两次失败后，有的就泄了气，说：“办工厂不是老娘们干的，不行啊！”孙景兰还是不认输，她把短头发一甩，斩钉截铁地说：“天下无难事，就怕有心人，困难怕啥？”她还耐心地对个别泄劲儿的姐妹们解释：“全国都在大跃进，咱们能坐在家里等别人建成社会主义吗？”这样提高和统一了大家的认识，小组坚持没有“散伙”。
    困难只能吓退那些胆小的人，孙景兰她们不但没被困难吓倒，反而更加坚定了办工厂的信心。她们参观了沈河区小五金厂以后，劲头更大了！大机床一时生产不出来，像发卡、钮扣等小商品，总是能生产出来吧，这也是人民生活所需要的呀！
    开办工厂得有厂房，大家找来找去，找到两间破鸡舍。房子能用，就是太脏。孙景兰看看大家，说了声“咱们动手打扫”，就脱光脚，第一个跳了进去，大家紧跟着也进去了，来了个彻底的清扫。房子有了，设备怎办？大家把家里的斧头、锤子、菜刀……都拿来了，孙景兰又到处去借“压力”。沈河区小五金厂答应支援妇女们四台“压力”，可是要政府给开个介绍信。
    孙景兰找到了党支部书记，党支部书记听她讲了办工厂的经过，当时就给开了介绍信，还对她说：“办工厂是好事，要注意依靠群众，有什么困难来找我，咱们共同研究。”孙景兰觉得心里热烘烘的，又高兴又激动，她终于流下了满眶热泪。
    揽任务是工厂能不能开工的关键，孙景兰每天早出晚归，几乎挨着个工厂跑。舍不得花车钱，就徒步走。她这种不怕困难的精神，这种一心想为社会主义大厦添砖盖瓦的美好愿望，感动了五金公司的工作人员，最后，给她们一部分剥钢丝的任务。工厂开工了。围着锅台转了多年的妇女，从今天开始变成了工人。她们那个高兴劲儿就不用提了，都忘我地工作着。
            雄心大志
    党提出大炼钢铁的号召以后，又激起了孙景兰她们的雄心大志，她们琢磨：我们能不能为钢铁元帅服点务呢？她们决定办个耐火器材厂。孙景兰到钢砖厂拜访了张技师。张技师笑了笑说：“支援元帅升帐是好事，我可以帮助。不过，这可不简单哪！砌个耐火窑就得五万块耐火砖……”怎办？妇女们核计一阵，决定用青砖砌大窑，用三合土代替水泥。可是，上哪儿弄这么多砖呢？经过研究，有的拆二门；有的扒花墙；有的把自己家的砖地也起了，众人捧柴火焰高，不到两天时间，五万块砖整整齐齐堆到工厂院子里了。没沙子，她们就地取材，在院子里挖。当挖到八、九尺深的时候，用锹已经扔不上来了，她们就用围裙往上吊。原材料弄齐了，请来两位懂行的就动手建起大窑来。
    修建大窑过程中，孙景兰和范素梅、慕素春等到十多米高的跳板上修烟囱；冒着风吹雨淋，日夜苦干，实在困了，她们就扭一阵秧歌提提精神，找不到应手的工具，就用脚和泥；找不到抹板子，就用手抹灰；哪儿碰破了，上点药水再干。修坏了再重来，没有一个人灰心，没有一个人面现难色。
    运料时，孙景兰她们从胶车社借一台大车，趁人家休息的时候，夜里从铁西往回运。从铁西区到孙景兰她们工厂，往返有五十华里，一车料两吨多，她们走走歇歇。孙景兰驾辕，也不知手脚碰破了多少次，她忍着疼痛，鼓励大家一定突破运料这一关。两名老瓦工被她们的苦干精神感动了，说：我们才六十多岁，还能为社会主义干一阵子哪，请求留下来当工人。从此，工厂里头一次有了男工。
    孙景兰和关维明等妇女们又学会了烧窑、看火。她们整日整夜地守在窑旁，烧成了就欢呼，烧出废品就抱着耐火材料掉泪。党组织发现她们技术上有困难，从肇新工厂调来了一名技师。这位技师也和她们一起日夜守在窑旁，别人劝他休息时，他说：“过去，我出废品可没哭过，说明你们的事业心比我强，我得向你们学习。”
            崇高的风格
    以孙景兰为首的十几名家庭妇女，像一个熊熊的火把，到处点燃起大办工厂的高潮。不到半年的光景，经她们的手就办起了小五金、耐火器材、铸造等工厂，参加生产的家庭妇女有三百四十八人。她们爱厂胜家，下班也不离开工厂。如果撵她们回去休息，她们从前门走了，又从后门溜回来；从干燥车间被撵走，又到粉碎车间干起活来。她们把自己家的炉子搬到工厂来，有的把结婚时亲友们赠送的茶壶、茶碗带来给大伙使用。桌、椅、水缸、水桶……工厂的东西一天天多起来，谁也弄不清是谁拿来的。问谁谁都不认账。工厂燃料不足，她们把自己家的煤拿来烧；雨天，妇女们争先把自己盖的被子苫在产品上。她们对自己的东西从不计较，对工厂的一分钱也要精打细算。为了做几条围裙和一床借宿用的被子，孙景兰领导大家讨论好几次，最后，谁也不同意花钱，都要自己想办法解决。孙景兰去年到北京开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子代表会议，说什么也不买卧铺。利用会议休息的时间，自己还拿钱买车票去唐山学习生产技术。
    当其它居民委员会也要办工厂时，孙景兰和她所领导的妇女，就主动地把自己费尽心血办起来的小五金厂和铸造厂，全部无代价地交出去了。她们说：大家都办工厂，人多力大，对社会主义建设更能加快啦！
    孙景兰现在已经是红旗耐火器材厂的厂长。一年来，在党的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，耐火器材厂高速度地发展着。厂房从原有的两间扩展到四十八间；原来只有一台手扳小型“压力”，现有大小机器二十台；工人由原有的十三人发展到今天的三百人；产品也由过去仅生产耐火砖到现在生产七十多种产品；月产值由二百元发展到五万元（连对外加工共十万元）。在他们生产的产品中，除四种工业用陶瓷品外，其余全部是民用产品。今年开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动以来，不但生产指标指日上升，劳动条件也有很大改善。从粉碎、成型到烧成车间，都实现了机械化和半机械化。经过技术表演赛的深入开展，妇女中80％以上达到国营工厂六、七级工的技术水平。
    孙景兰，一年前还是一个普通的家庭妇女，由于她坚决听党的话，在大办工业的洪炉中经受起严重的考验，迅速地提高了共产主义觉悟，在1958年底，光荣地参加了中国共产党，成为工人阶级的先锋战士。
