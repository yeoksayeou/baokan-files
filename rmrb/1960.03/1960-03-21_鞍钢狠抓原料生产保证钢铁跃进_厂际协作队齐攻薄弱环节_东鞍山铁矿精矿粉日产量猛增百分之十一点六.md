Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Telegram – Anshan Iron and Steel's raw material production has been continuously increasing recently. In late February and early March, the production of iron ore, concentrated ore powder, and artificial rich ore all set new records since operations began.

The speed of raw material production growth is the key to determining the magnitude of the leap forward in steel production. As early as the beginning of February, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee focused heavily on this weak link. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the employees of the raw material production departments were full of vigor and momentum, determined to let the blast furnaces "eat their fill and eat well," and vowed to seize continuous great leaps forward in steel production in March and the first quarter.

In the battle to attack the key to raw material production, the relevant factories and mines universally carried out communist large-scale collaboration. More than a dozen factories and mines, such as the Sintering General Plant and the Northern Machinery Repair Plant, voluntarily contributed technical forces and machinery and equipment to help the Dong Anshan Mine employees surround and attack the flotation filtration barrier. With the strong support of the raw material departments, Anshan Iron and Steel's pig iron production level in the first four days of March increased by 8.8% compared to February.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th – Anshan Iron and Steel Company promotes the communist collaboration style in a big way, forming plant-to-plant collaboration teams to help Dong Anshan Iron Mine innovate flotation operation technology, so that the output of concentrated ore powder has increased rapidly. Comparing March 1st to 12th with the same period in February, the average daily output of concentrated ore powder increased by 11.6%, and the average iron content also increased by 0.2%.

Dong Anshan Iron Mine is one of the main raw material bases of Anshan Iron and Steel. This year, the requirement for concentrated ore powder supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel has been increased by more than double compared to last year. However, the flotation workshop of this mine has only been put into production for more than a year, and the workers' operating skills are not yet proficient enough, and the output of concentrated ore powder could not be increased for a while, becoming a weak link in the mine's production. Therefore, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee decided to mobilize relevant factories and mines, and on February 12th, a plant-to-plant collaboration team was formed to help Dong Anshan Iron Mine innovate flotation operation technology. This plant-to-plant collaboration team was composed of more than 30 experienced veteran workers, technical innovation experts, engineering technicians, and management cadres from ten units including the Sintering General Plant, Dagushan Iron Mine, Water Supply Plant, Electric Repair Plant, three Machinery Repair Plants, and the Mechanical Department, Power Department, and Mining Technology Department.

After the plant-to-plant collaboration team arrived at Dong Anshan Iron Mine, according to the decision of the mine's Party Committee, they disseminated their advanced experience through on-site technical demonstrations. Before the technical demonstration, all members of the plant-to-plant collaboration team held a meeting to concentrate and match the advanced operation methods brought by each unit, and sorted out a set of more advanced operation methods. In the demonstration, Meng Fanzeng, a veteran worker from the Sintering General Plant, attracted attention by using advanced operation methods such as increasing the amount of air and adding chemical reagents, so that the iron content in the tailings discarded after flotation was reduced from 28% to 12%, and the lowest was reduced to 10.5%, thus increasing the output of concentrated ore powder. Ball mill worker Gu Dongsheng flexibly adjusted the amount of medicine added according to the changing composition of the ore, so that the slurry concentration, which fluctuated greatly, quickly returned to normal, and production steadily increased.

The Party Secretary and Mine Director of Dong Anshan Iron Mine personally led the cadres of various sections and workshops and more than 100 workers from the flotation workshop to observe and study the collaboration team members' performances at the technical demonstration site. They not only carefully observed each action, but also recorded each advanced experience of the performers one by one. After the performance, a forum discussion was held. The next day, a joint operation technology performance was carried out throughout the mine to consolidate the advanced operation methods that had been learned and further improve the operation level of the flotation workers.

Through the technical demonstration of the collaboration team, not only the operation technology level of this mine was improved, but also the management work was improved. Many advanced operating experiences were enriched in the technical demonstration, and were finally listed as operating procedures, and a set of management system was established.

    鞍钢狠抓原料生产保证钢铁跃进
    厂际协作队齐攻薄弱环节
    东鞍山铁矿精矿粉日产量猛增百分之十一点六
    据新华社鞍山电　鞍钢的原料生产最近以来不断增长。2月末3月初，铁矿石、精矿粉和人造富矿的生产，都创造了开工以来的新纪录。
    原料生产增长的快慢，是决定钢铁生产跃进幅度大小的关键。鞍钢党委早在2月初，就大抓狠抓这一薄弱环节。原料生产部门职工在党委领导下干劲冲天，气势磅礴，决心让高炉“吃得饱吃得好”，誓夺3月份和第一季度钢铁生产不断大跃进。
    在猛攻原料生产关键的战斗中，有关厂矿普遍开展了共产主义大协作。烧结总厂、北部机修厂等十几个厂矿，都自动拿出技术力量和机器设备，帮助东鞍山矿职工围攻浮选过滤关。在原料部门的大力支援下，3月头四天鞍钢的生铁生产水平比2月份增长了8．8％。
    据新华社鞍山20日电　鞍山钢铁公司大兴共产主义协作之风，组成厂际协作队，帮助东鞍山铁矿革新浮选操作技术，使精矿粉产量飞速上升。以3月1日到12日与2月份同期相比，精矿粉平均日产量提高了11．6％，平均含铁量也提高了0．2％。
    东鞍山铁矿是鞍钢主要原料基地之一，今年供应鞍钢的精矿粉要求比去年增加一倍以上。但是，这个矿的浮选车间投入生产才一年多，工人操作技术还不够熟练，精矿粉产量一时提不高，成为全矿生产中的薄弱环节。因此，鞍钢党委决定发动有关厂矿，在2月12日组成了帮助东鞍山铁矿革新浮选操作技术的厂际协作队。这支厂际协作队是由烧结总厂、大孤山铁矿、给水厂、电修厂、三个机修厂和机械处、动力处、矿山技术处十个单位的有经验的老工人、技术革新能手、工程技术人员和管理干部三十多人组成的。
    厂际协作队到东鞍山铁矿以后，根据矿党委决定，通过现场技术表演，传播了他们的先进经验。在技术表演以前，厂际协作队全体成员曾举行会议，把各个单位带来的先进操作方法集中配套，整理出一套更先进的操作方法。在表演中，烧结总厂老工人孟凡增，引人注目地运用加大空气量和加药剂等先进操作方法，使浮选以后废弃的尾矿内的含铁量，由28％下降到12％，最低下降到10．5％，这样就增加了精矿粉的产量。球磨工谷冬生根据矿石成分多变的情况，灵活地调整加药量，使波动很大的矿浆浓度很快正常起来，生产稳步上升。
    东鞍山铁矿的党委书记、矿长亲自率领各科室、车间干部和浮选车间一百多名工人，到技术表演现场观摩学习协作队员们的表演。他们不但仔细地观察每个动作，还一一记录表演者的每项先进经验。表演以后，举行了座谈讨论。第二天，还开展了全矿联合操作技术大表演，巩固已经学到的先进操作方法，进一步提高浮选工人的操作水平。
    通过协作队的技术表演，不但提高了这个矿的操作技术水平，而且改进了管理工作。许多先进操作经验在技术表演中得到充实，最后被列为操作规程，建立了一套管理制度。
