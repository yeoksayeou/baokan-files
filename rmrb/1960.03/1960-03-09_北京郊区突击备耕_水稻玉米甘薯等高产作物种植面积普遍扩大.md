Xinhua News Agency Report: The mass movement to prepare for spring planting in the suburbs of Beijing is developing vigorously and deeply, presenting an excellent situation of continued comprehensive leap forward.

Striving to plant more high-yield crops is a characteristic of this year's spring plowing in the suburbs of Beijing. People's communes are preparing to sow seeds in fields planned for high-yield crops. Daxing County plans to increase the area planted with high-yield crops such as rice by 40% compared to last year. The planting plan has been basically implemented down to the teams and the land; of the 200,000 mu of farmland prepared for rice cultivation, 130,000 mu have already completed field construction. Tong County plans for high-yield crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, multi-spike sorghum, and rice to account for 94% of the grain crop area, an expansion of 21% compared to last year. These high-yield crop plots were generally deep-plowed and deeply turned over before winter. The Yongledian People's Commune expanded its rice area from 20,000 mu last year to 50,000 mu, of which 35,000 mu have already received 10,000 jin of fertilizer. In order to cultivate 210,000 mu of high-yield crops such as corn, multi-spike sorghum, and sweet potatoes, Miyun County is preparing for spring irrigation, and more than 5,800 mu of barren land has been preliminarily improved.

In the preparation for spring plowing, all regions have given full play to the superiority of the People's Communes, promoted the spirit of communist cooperation, launched major crash programs, and engaged in large-scale operations, accelerating the progress of various productions. After completing its fertilizer delivery task, the Dazhongsi Brigade of the Haidian People's Commune in the Haidian District voluntarily dispatched manpower and fifty large carts to support the Qinghe Brigade in delivering manure, working from three in the morning until ten at night. Under the slogan "Early is best, attack fertilizer vigorously," the entire commune promoted large-scale cooperation and fought hard for nine days, transporting over 110 million jin of fertilizer, doubling the amount of fertilizer applied compared to last year, and advancing the fertilizer delivery time by one month. The Shayu Management Area of the Qiaozi People's Commune in Huairou County is located in the deep mountains with infertile land. In order to solve the problem of spring irrigation water, the Dongtai Production Team and the Sancha and Zhuanghu teams jointly collaborated to dig mountain springs and open canals, solving the spring irrigation water for thousands of mu of high-yield corn plots.

    北京郊区突击备耕
    水稻玉米甘薯等高产作物种植面积普遍扩大
    据新华社讯　北京郊区准备春播的群众运动，正在汹涌澎湃地深入开展，呈现着继续全面跃进的大好局面。
    力争多种高产作物，是北京郊区今年春耕中的一个特点。各人民公社正在计划种植高产作物的田中进行播种准备工作。大兴县今年计划种植的水稻等高产作物面积，比去年增加40％。种植计划已经基本落实到队、到地；准备改种水稻的二十万亩田地，已有十三万亩完成了田间工程。通县今年计划种植的玉米、甘薯、多穗高粱、水稻等高产作物占粮食作物面积的94％，比去年扩大21％。这些高产作物的地块，在冬前就普遍进行了深耕深翻。永乐店人民公社水稻面积从去年的两万亩扩大到五万亩，其中三万五千亩已送肥万斤。密云县为了种好二十一万亩玉米、多穗高粱、甘薯等高产作物，正在准备春灌，土质瘠薄的土地已经有五千八百多亩经过初步改良。
    各地在备耕运动中，充分发挥人民公社优越性，发扬共产主义协作精神，展开大突击，大兵团作战，加快了各项生产的进度。海淀区海淀人民公社大钟寺大队在完成本队送肥任务以后，主动抽出人力和五十辆大车支援清河大队送粪，从清晨三点一直干到晚上十点。全社在“一早百早，猛攻肥料”的口号下，大兴协作，大战九天，已经运出肥料一亿一千多万斤，施肥量比去年翻了一番，送肥时间比去年提早一个月。怀柔县桥梓人民公社沙峪管理区地处深山，土地贫瘠。为了解决春灌用水，洞台生产队和三岔、庄户两个队共同协作凿山泉，开渠道，解决了千亩玉米丰产方的春灌用水。
