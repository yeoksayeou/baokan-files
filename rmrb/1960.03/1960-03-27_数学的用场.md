How to Cut Wood into Beams

A tree! After removing the branches and leaves, peeling off the bark, and sawing off both ends, what remains is the trunk, generally a cylinder. How should it be cut into a beam to best withstand pressure? Without calculation, one might think cutting it into a square prism would suffice, but that's not actually the case! According to the considerations of material mechanics, the following method is best and most resistant to pressure.

Divide the diameter AB of the tree trunk into three equal parts. At one of the division points, C, draw a line perpendicular to AB, intersecting the circumference at D. A rectangle with sides AD and BD as the cross-section of the beam can best withstand pressure. In other words, placing such a beam with the short side horizontal and the long side vertical makes it most resistant to pressure.

What is the theoretical basis? Material mechanics proves that the strength of a beam with a rectangular cross-section of base length b and height length h is proportional to the product bh². Thus, our problem transforms into determining the length x (=BC) that maximizes bh². (Now b=BD, h=AD), using d to represent the diameter AB.

Since triangle BDC is similar to ABD, we get b²=dx. For the same reason, h²=d(d-x). Therefore, our problem transforms into finding x that maximizes (bh²)² = dx[d(d-x)]² = d³x(d-x)², where the range of x is from 0 to d. Since d³(d/3)(d-d/3)²=d³4d³27=427d6 and only when x=d/3, the equals sign can appear. Therefore, we obtain that only when x=d/3, the left side can equal the right side; in other cases, the left side must be less than the right side. This is our theoretical basis. When x=d/3, h=√(2/3)d, b=√(1/3)d, so d:h:b=√3:√2:1. Therefore, the ratio of height to base of such a beam is √2 ≈ 1.4... which is almost 7/5, so we can also use a height-to-base ratio of 7 to 5 as the requirement. If it is cut into a square prism, then b=h=1/√2d, and its strength is proportional to bh²=1/√8d³. The ratio of the strength of the cutting method introduced here to the strength of the square prism is 1/√3⋅2/3:1/√8, which is approximately a 9% increase in strength, while the ratio of material used is, i.e., a 10% saving in material. Therefore, with this cutting method, the strength is increased by 9%, and the material is saved by 10%.

    怎样开木料做成横梁
    树！去掉枝叶，剥掉树皮，锯掉两头剩下树干，成为木料，一般可以作为一个圆柱体。怎样把它切成横梁才最受得起压力，不经计算也许会以为切成正方形的方柱就行了，实际不然！根据材料力学的考虑，以下的方法最好，最经得住压力。
    把树干的直径AB分为三等分，在分点之一C作AB的垂直线，交圆周于D，以AD与BD为边的长方形为横截面的横梁，最受得起压力，也就是把这样的横梁以短边水平向，长边垂直向地安放，最受得起压力。
    理论根据是什么？材料力学证明，一个底长为b，高长为h的长方形为横截面的横梁的强度与乘积bh2成比例，于是我们的问题一变而为取多么长x（＝BC）使bh2最大。（现在b＝BD，h＝AD），用d表直径AB。
    由于三角形BDC与ABD相似，所以得b2＝dx，同样理由h2＝d（d－x），因此我们的问题一变而为求X使
    （bh2）2＝dx〔d（d－x）〕2＝d3x（d－x）2最大，这儿x的变化范围是o到d。由于且仅当x＝d3时，等号所能出现，因此得且仅当x＝d3时，左边才可能等于右边，其它的情况，左边一定小于右边，这便是我们的理论根据。当x＝d3时，h＝√23d，b＝√13d，所以d∶h∶b＝√3∶√2∶1，所以这样横梁的高与底的比，是√2＝1．4……差不多是75，所以也可以用高底之比是7比5来要求。如果切成方柱，则b＝h＝1√2d，其强度与bh2＝1√8d3成比例。这儿所介绍的切法的强度与方柱的强度之比是1√3·23∶1√8，约增强了9％，但用材料的比是，即节约用材10％，因此，这样的切法，强度加强了9％，而材料节约了10％。
