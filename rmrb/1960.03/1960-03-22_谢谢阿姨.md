    Thank you, Auntie
    I love children the most, and I always play with them for a while after getting off work every day. But one day, my youngest son, Kewei, suddenly turned red and developed a high fever. I rushed him to the hospital, and the doctor diagnosed him with hepatitis, saying, "The child has hepatitis and needs to be isolated and recuperated for a while." What should I do? I have to go to the factory, who will take care of the child? How can I prevent the other three children from getting infected? I was worried when the doctor suggested that I go to the kindergarten sanatorium of the Dasantiao Street Nursery to see if there were any beds available. I went to take a look, and it turned out that the aunties and nurses in this sanatorium were all my neighbors. After being trained by the hospital, they had learned the skills to care for diseases such as hepatitis. I entrusted my child to them with peace of mind and went to work.
    The aunties and nurses were so good to the children. The dozens of children in the sanatorium were arranged according to the severity of their conditions. They took their temperatures, gave them medicine, paid attention to their diet and nutrition, and took care of them day and night, even more carefully than their mothers. The seriously ill children improved in a few days, and the mildly ill children recovered even faster. When my child, Kewei, left the sanatorium, he not only gained a lot of weight, but also became more polite and sensible.
    Children living in our era are so happy. I will definitely work hard in production and thank the Party for its care and the aunties and nurses for their care with outstanding achievements.

    谢谢阿姨
    我最爱孩子，每天下班后，总要和孩子们玩一会。可是，有一天，小儿子克威突然满脸通红，发起高烧来。我急忙带孩子上医院，大夫诊断后说：“孩子得的是肝炎，要好好隔离，调养些日子就好了。”怎么办呢？自己要上工厂，谁来照顾这孩子呢？怎样才能避免其他三个孩子传染上呢？我正发愁，大夫介绍我到大三条街道托儿所的幼儿疗养所去看看有没床位？我跑去一看，原来这疗养所的阿姨、护士都是自己的街坊，她们经过医院的培养，已经学会护理肝炎等病的技术，我很放心地把孩子交给她们，就上工去了。
    阿姨、护士们对孩子可好啦，所里几十个孩子，按病情轻重安置，每天给他们量温度，吃药，注意饮食营养，日夜护理，真比妈妈还照顾得周到。重病的孩子不几天就转轻了，轻病的好得更快。我的孩子克威出所时不但体重增加了许多，而且变得更加有礼貌、懂事了。
    生活在我们时代里的孩子真是幸福，我一定努力生产，以出色的成绩来感谢党的关怀和阿姨、护士们的照顾。
