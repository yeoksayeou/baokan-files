    Mr. Yu Feian's meticulous flower and bird paintings were once loved by the broad masses. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House has recently published "Selected Works of Yu Feian's Meticulous Flower and Bird Paintings," exquisitely printing more than thirty representative works from the author's lifetime. This is very beneficial for many later scholars or readers who like Mr. Yu Feian's painting art.
    Yu Feian liked raising flowers, birds, insects, and fish from a young age. At the age of twenty-three or four, he studied painting with a folk painter in his spare time. Initially, he learned freehand flower and bird paintings and landscape paintings, and only began learning meticulous flower and bird paintings at the age of forty-six. At that time, the opening of the Palace Museum gave him a good opportunity to learn. From Chen Laolian of the late Ming Dynasty, tracing back to the Five Dynasties and the Northern Song Dynasty, such as the works of Huang Quan, Huang Jucai, Cui Bai, Zhao Chang, and Zhao Ji, he made extremely detailed studies and put in great effort to copy them. However, before liberation, many of his creations could hardly be said to have any innovation. His creative thinking was not liberated, and he mostly pursued the brushwork and ink charm of the ancients. As Mr. Yu Feian himself said, in an environment where brush and ink are supreme, elegance is valued, court paintings are despised, and folk paintings are looked down upon, it is really not easy to create new flower and bird paintings. After liberation, the new life stimulated his creative enthusiasm, enriched his creative inspiration, and the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" inspired him to create boldly. In this way, the ancient brush and ink techniques he had learned in the past could truly be inherited and developed; the rich experience of flowers, plants, and insects accumulated over decades could also be applied to his creations, achieving "taking nature as a teacher." It can be said that only after liberation did Yu Feian's art gradually reach a wonderful realm. The works in this selection are mostly made after 1949, which powerfully illustrates this fact.
    Because of its detailed depiction, meticulous painting is prone to falling into stiffness or, due to insufficient skill, being too weak. In short, it inevitably seeks form but loses spirit. Mr. Qi Baishi knew this well. He once said: "Large ink brush paintings rarely achieve likeness in form; fine ink brush paintings rarely achieve likeness in spirit." Yu Feian's paintings do not have this problem. He often took "achieving both form and spirit" as his creative requirement, and also "brought forth new ideas from time to time" in terms of subject matter and conception. For example, "Magnolia and Oriole" and "Red Apricot and Partridge" in the selection are both excellent works that have long been welcomed by readers. Beautiful birds on branches, full of spring, are full of vibrant vitality, which is inspiring to see. In terms of color, he absorbed the strengths of folk paintings, which are rich, bright, and highly decorative. These flower and bird paintings do not have originality in their inscriptions and themes, but through the "vivid and fragrant" images, they cultivate people's positive and healthy aesthetic feelings.

    “于非暗工笔花鸟选集”
    沈鹏
    于非暗先生的工笔花鸟画曾受到广大群众的喜爱。人民美术出版社最近出版了“于非暗工笔花鸟选集”，精印了作者生前的三十余幅代表作品。这对许多后学者或是喜欢于非暗先生的绘画艺术的读者都是非常有益的。
    于非暗自幼喜欢养花鸟虫鱼，二十三四岁时在业余从一位民间画师学习绘画，最初学的是写意花鸟和山水画，到四十六岁才开始学工笔花鸟。当时适逢故宫开放，给予他很好的学习机会。从明末的陈老莲，上溯两宋五代，如黄鉴、黄居宷、崔白、赵昌、赵佶诸家的作品，他都作过极其细致的研究，并用很大的功夫临摹。但是在解放前，他的许多创作还很难说有什么革新，创作思想没有解放，追求的多是古人的笔情墨趣。正如于非暗先生自己说的，在笔墨至上，淡雅是尚，轻视院体画，轻视民间画的环境里，要创作新的花鸟画，这真是不太容易的事。解放后，新的生活激发了他的创作热情，丰富了他的创作灵感，党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针启发他大胆创作。这样，过去学到的古人笔墨，才真正得以继承和发展；数十年间对花卉草虫的丰富体验，也才得以运用到创作上来，作到了“以造化为师”。可以说，只是在解放以后，于非暗的艺术才逐渐臻于妙境。这本选集里的作品，绝大部分是1949年以后所作，便有力地说明了这个事实。
    工笔画由于刻划细致，容易流于僵硬呆板，或因工力不足而失于柔弱，总之是不免求其形而失其神。齐白石老先生深知此中三昧，他说过：“大墨笔之画，难得形似；纤细墨笔之画，难得神似。”于非暗的画就没有这个毛病。他常以“形神兼到”作为自己创作的要求，并在取材构思上，还能“时出新意”。例如选集里的“玉兰黄鹂”、“红杏山鹧”等，都是早已受到读者欢迎的佳作。好鸟枝头，春意盎然，充满了蓬勃的生气，看了令人振奋。在设色上，他吸收了民间绘画的长处，浓重艳丽，装饰性很强，这些花鸟画，没有在题词取材上别出心裁，却透过“活色生香”的形象，培养人们积极向上的情绪和健康的美感。
