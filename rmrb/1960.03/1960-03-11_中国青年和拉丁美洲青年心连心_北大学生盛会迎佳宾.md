Xinhua News Agency, March 9th. Peking University students held a gathering on the evening of March 8th to warmly welcome representatives of student organizations from five Latin American countries – Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, and Venezuela – who are currently visiting China.

As the representatives of the five countries' student organizations entered the venue, students throughout the hall enthusiastically shouted:

"Chinese students resolutely stand with Cuban and Latin American students and people, fighting to the end against U.S. imperialism's aggression and defending world peace!"

"Chinese students resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialist interference and aggression!"

Zhang Bingguang, Chairman of the Peking University Student Union, first expressed his highest respect at the welcoming ceremony to the Latin American people and youth who are waging a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and in defense of national independence. Zhang Bingguang said that the visit of student representatives from the five Latin American countries to China will undoubtedly increase the solidarity and friendship between Chinese students and Latin American students. Chinese students will always stand on the side of the Latin American people and students, fighting to the end against U.S. imperialism and defending world peace.

Representatives of the five countries' student organizations spoke in succession. When they spoke of the heroic struggle of the Latin American people and students against U.S. imperialism, they won prolonged cheers and applause from the audience. Vivas, a representative of the Cuban University Student Federation, said that the Cuban revolutionary struggle will never retreat in the face of U.S. imperialist interference and aggression, and it will firmly continue to the final goal. Paulero, Chairman of the Argentine University Student Federation, said that Argentine students are struggling against U.S. imperialism to defend national sovereignty. Meleires, Vice Chairman of the Brazilian National Student Union, said that Brazilian youth are facing the same moment China faced ten years ago.

Bindo, Secretary-General of the Honduran University Student Federation, emphasized that the anti-imperialist struggle has become the common goal of youth and people in Latin American countries. He said that, as a revolutionary writer from Honduras said, Latin American students must hold a book in one hand and a gun in the other. Figueroa, a representative of the Venezuelan University Student Federation, said that the victory of the Chinese revolution has greatly strengthened the forces of the anti-imperialist struggle and greatly strengthened the forces of the Latin American people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

In their speeches, they also expressed their determination to tell their classmates about the great achievements of the new China and the learning and labor of Chinese students for the socialist construction of the motherland, and they will definitely work to strengthen the unity and friendship between Latin American and Chinese students.
