One's Own “Brickyard”
	Wang Zhong

	The fact that Wang Baojing went to university made many people happy. As an educator, I am naturally particularly excited.

	"University," this resounding and "mysterious" word, once aroused the yearning of many people! However, in old China, the laboring people were oppressed by the three great enemies, living a life like beasts of burden. Not to mention universities, even elementary schools were inaccessible. At that time, in the Northwest region, a graduate of a higher primary school wrote the following couplet at the entrance of his home: The first line was: "Never before in a hundred years has there been such a thing"; the second line was: "The number one person within fifty li." The horizontal inscription read: "Higher Primary School Graduate." A higher primary school graduate was so arrogant and put up the sign of "I am the number one in the world." This precisely illustrates the pitifulness and ridiculousness of education in old China! In the old society, the laboring people were cut off from books and writing.

	Today, in the new China, hundreds of millions of children of the laboring people are enrolled in schools, and workers and peasants themselves are also studying in spare-time schools or half-day schools. "Everyone goes to school, and every household has the sound of reading." "An eighty-year-old man studies culture, opening his eyes to spend his old age." This is not something that can be expressed by the phrase "Never before in a hundred years has there been such a thing." Therefore, Wang Baojing's going to university made the older generation in his hometown exclaim with emotion: "There has never been such a thing in all the wonders of the past and present!" "Baojing's going to university is Chairman Mao promoting us peasants!" Yes, Wang Baojing's going to university is not just a matter for Wang Baojing alone, nor is it just a matter for their village. This matter reflects the great victory of our Party's education policy, and it means that thousands upon thousands of laboring people are embarking on the broad road to knowledge, and the difference between mental and manual labor is being gradually eliminated.

	Bourgeois education serves bourgeois politics. They cultivate young masters, young ladies, and young gentlemen, regarding the university as a "forbidden palace" in the cultural world, and keeping the laboring people out beyond the high "palace walls." Not only that, but they also create various "theories" to uglify and slander the children of the laboring people, saying that they have "no talent" and "can only smell cow dung." The opposite is true. It is precisely those bourgeois "experts" who say that the children of the laboring people have no talent who are the real fools. For those who diligently "study" "Whether Wang Xifeng has big feet or small feet?" "How much protein does a scorpion's tail contain?" and are obsessed with writing "A History of Gambling in China," wouldn't it be appropriate to give them the title of "Number one muddlehead in the world!" If these people are not thoroughly reformed, how can they adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward?

	Wang Baojing's going to university, and the good news of thousands upon thousands of laboring people entering various types of schools to study, precisely illustrates that a group of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert are growing and becoming stronger. They are our main force in building socialism and communism. Lenin once said that in the early days of the revolution, we could only "use the bricks that the capitalists picked up to hit us to build communism!" Because "we have no other bricks!" ("Lenin on National Education," page 316, published by People's Education Press) Obviously, it is not feasible for us to only use such "bricks" to build tall buildings for a long time.

	Today, it is no longer the time for us to exclusively use "bricks picked up by capitalists to hit us" to build socialism. We have already built our own cultural, scientific, and technological "brickyard," using brand new bricks and tiles—working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert—to build socialism and communism. Even the original bourgeois intellectuals, more and more of them, have recognized their true and bright future, are willing to accept the leadership of the Party and the working class, and completely transform themselves to become intellectuals of the working class. Wang Baojing has entered university, and more people like Wang Baojing are also stepping through the door of the university, with a bright future ahead, and this is only the first step. How can we not cheer for the expansion of the ranks of the working-class intellectuals?!

### 自己的“窑厂”

    自己的“窑厂”
    王重
    王保京上大学这件事，使许多人为之高兴，我作为一个教育工作者来说，自然是格外兴奋了。
    “大学”，这个响亮而又“神秘”的字眼，曾经引起多少人的向往啊！但是，在旧中国，劳动人民受着三大敌人的压迫，过着牛马般的生活，不要说是大学，就是连小学也是无法问津的。那时，就在西北地区有一个高小毕业生回乡后在大门口写了这样一副对联：上联是：“百年以来无此事”；下联是：“五十里内第一人”。横匾上写道：“高小毕业”。一个高小毕业生竟然如此目空一切，打起“老子天下第一”的招牌，正是说明旧中国教育的可怜和可笑！旧社会劳动人民是与书本、笔墨绝缘的。
    今天，新的中国却有亿万劳动人民的子弟入学，工人农民自己也在业余的学校或半日制学校学习。“人人都入学，户户读书声”。“八十老公学文化，睁开双眼过晚年。”这就不是“百年以来无此事”一句话所能表达的了。所以，王保京上大学，他家乡老一辈的人感慨万千：“今古奇观里也没这号事情啊！”“保京上大学是毛主席提拔咱们农民啊！”是的，王保京上大学，并不是王保京一个人的事情，也不是他们一个村的事情。这件事反映了我国党的教育方针的伟大胜利，是意味着千千万万劳动人民正走上了知识化的康庄大道，脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别正在逐步消灭。
    资产阶级教育是为资产阶级的政治服务的。他们培养少爷、小姐、公子哥儿。把大学当成文化界的“禁宫”，把劳动人民拒之于高高的“宫墙”之外。不仅如此，还制造各种“理论”，丑化和污蔑劳动人民的子弟。说他们是“没有天才”，“只能闻牛屁股。”事实恰恰相反，正是那些说劳动人民子女没有天才的资产阶级“专家”才是真正的笨伯。对于那些孜孜“研究”“王熙凤是大脚还是小脚？”“蝎子尾巴含蛋白质多少？”和醉心于编写“中国赌博史”的“专家”，不是把“天字第一号的糊涂虫”的称呼送给他们也当之无愧吗！这些人如果不彻底改造，怎么能够适应大跃进的形势呢？
    王保京的上大学，和千千万万劳动人民进入各种类型的学校学习的喜事，正说明一批又红又专的工人阶级知识分子正在成长壮大起来。他们是我们建设社会主义、共产主义的主力军。列宁曾经说过，在革命的初期，我们只能“用资本家挑来打我们的砖头建设共产主义！”因为“我们没有别的砖头！”（“列宁论国民教育”，第316页，人民教育出版社出版）很显然，我们长期都只用这样的“砖头”来建设高楼大厦是不行的。
    今天，我们不是专用“资本家挑来打我们的砖头”来建设社会主义的时候了，我们已经建起了自己的文化科学技术的“窑厂”，用崭新的砖瓦——又红又专的工人阶级知识分子来建设社会主义和共产主义了。就是原来的资产阶级知识分子，也有越来越多的人，认识了他们的真正的光明前途，愿意接受党和工人阶级的领导，彻底脱胎换骨，使自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。王保京进大学了，更多的像王保京这样的人也正在跨进大学之门，鹏程万里，这才是第一步。我们怎能不为工人阶级知识分子的队伍的扩大而欢呼呢？！
