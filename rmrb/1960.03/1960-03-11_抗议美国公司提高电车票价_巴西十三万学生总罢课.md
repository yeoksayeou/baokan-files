    Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, March 10th: 130,000 students in Brazil held a general strike yesterday to protest the American-owned "Brazilian Tram, Light and Power Company's" increase in tram fares and the police's use of violence against students opposing the American company.
    The general strike was held based on a call issued by the Brazilian National Student Union on the evening of March 8th.
    The chairman of the Brazilian National Student Union, Conrado, told reporters that they will meet with President Kubitschek to demand that the American company maintain the original fare and that the Minister of Justice be dismissed. He said that when students protested the American company's increase in fares, the Minister of Justice actually ordered the police to use violence against students at the Brazilian National Student Union and the Law School of the University of Brazil.
    He said that the strike would not stop unless the Minister of Justice, Armando Falcão, was removed from office.
    Since the American company increased tram fares from three cruzeiros to five cruzeiros on March 5th, students in the capital have held daily rallies and demonstrations and prevented trams from running, and these students have been violently suppressed by the police.
    Students in São Paulo held a rally in the city center square on March 8th, condemning the Minister of Justice for ordering the police to use violence at the behest of imperialist trusts.
    The students' protests against the American company have received support from the Brazilian public. Sales Neto, a councilor of the National Democratic Union in the Rio de Janeiro City Council, spoke in the Rio de Janeiro City Council on March 8th in support of the students' just actions. The Brazilian National Student Union has received telegrams and letters of support from all over Brazil, including telegrams and letters of support from metallurgical, aviation and other trade union organizations in São Paulo, as well as trade union leaders from the city of Campinas.

    抗议美国公司提高电车票价
    巴西十三万学生总罢课
    据新华社10日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西十三万学生昨天举行总罢课，抗议美资“巴西电车、电灯和电力公司”提高电车票价以及警察对反对美国公司的学生使用暴力。
    总罢课是根据巴西全国学生联合会8日晚上发出的号召举行的。
    巴西全国学生联合会主席康拉多向记者发表谈话说，他们将去会见库比契克总统，要求使美国公司维持原来的票价，并且要求免除司法部长的职务。他说，当学生们抗议美国公司提高票价时，司法部长竟命令警察对在巴西全国学生联合会和巴西大学法学院的学生使用暴力。
    他说，不撤销司法部长阿曼多·法耳考的职务，罢课便不停止。
    自从美国公司自5日起把电车票价由三克鲁赛罗增加到五克鲁赛罗后，首都的学生连日集会示威并且阻止电车行驶，这些学生遭到警察的暴力镇压。
    圣保罗的学生们8日在市中心广场举行了集会，谴责司法部长奉帝国主义托辣斯之命叫警察行使暴力。
    学生对美国公司的抗议得到了巴西公众的支持。里约热内卢市议会全国民主联盟的议员萨莱斯·内托8日在里约热内卢市议会发言支持学生的正义行动。巴西全国学生联合会收到了来自巴西各地的表示支援的电报和信件，其中有圣保罗的冶金、航空等工会组织以及卡姆彼那斯城各工会领袖的支援电报和信件。
