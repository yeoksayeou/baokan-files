　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th -- Seoul dispatch: Thousands of people in Masan, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, broke out in large-scale demonstrations on the afternoon of the 15th, protesting the Syngman Rhee clique's manufacturing of the "election." This day was the date stipulated by the Syngman Rhee clique for the so-called "presidential election."

　　Starting from 6:00 PM, thousands of citizens and students surrounded the Masan municipal government office of the puppet Rhee regime, shouting "Election invalid." Angry masses set fire to the North Masan police station and smashed four other police stations and the city party headquarters of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party. The masses also destroyed a police car and cut off power lines. The city was plunged into complete darkness by night.

　　The Syngman Rhee clique frantically mobilized all the police and puppet Rhee troops stationed in the area, using tear gas and water cannons to suppress the people madly. However, the masses, with very high morale for the struggle, fought stubbornly against the military police. As of 10:30 PM on the 15th, seven people had died and seventy-three were injured on both sides.

　　After this incident occurred, the Syngman Rhee clique was thrown into chaos. They transferred police and the 39th Division of the puppet Rhee army from the areas near Masan to Masan to carry out brutal suppression and, from 10:40 PM last night, prohibited reporters from reporting the truth of the incident. At the same time, more than 700 citizens and students in Seoul held demonstrations on the 15th, opposing the "election" manufactured by the Syngman Rhee clique.

　　According to South Korean Tonga News Agency reports, at noon on the 13th, more than fifty college students held a demonstration in front of the US Embassy in Seoul. They were suppressed by Syngman Rhee's police, and seventeen or eighteen students were arrested. On the same day, more than two hundred college students in Osan, not far south of Seoul, also held demonstrations, and nine students were arrested.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th -- Seoul dispatch: After all the bloody suppression, the Syngman Rhee clique monopolized the South Korean presidential "election" held on the 15th. According to Seoul radio today, Liberal Party candidates Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong were "elected" as pseudo-president and pseudo-vice-president.

　　This is the second time in eight years that Syngman Rhee has "won" an election against a dead man. Cho Byeong-ok, the Democratic Party candidate who was the only one running against Syngman Rhee for "president" this time, suddenly died in the United States on February 15th. Although Syngman Rhee no longer had an opponent, according to the South Korean "constitution," he had to obtain one-third of the votes to be elected. Lee Ki-poong's main opponent this time was still Chang Myon of the Democratic Party. Lee Ki-poong had been defeated by Chang Myon in the "vice-presidential" election four years ago.

　　The opposition parties in South Korea, such as the Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, have declared that this "election" is "illegal and invalid."

　　According to South Korean Hapdong News Agency reports, "This election was conducted in a tense atmosphere and under strict guard." Dozens to hundreds of fully armed police and secret agents guarded each polling station, and police and military police patrolled the streets on horseback, monitoring every move of the voters. On the 15th, voters were forced into groups of three from early morning and taken to the polling stations, where they were monitored by the secret service organization, the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," and forced to cast votes "supporting" Syngman Rhee. At the second polling station in Busan, some voters were beaten by secret agents after the fact for refusing to vote for Syngman Rhee. It was reported that a dozen people were beaten to death in the "election" on the 15th. In order to facilitate fraud, the Syngman Rhee clique sent thugs to drive out and beat the Democratic Party's "election" supervisors from polling stations in Seoul, Chuncheon, Cheorwon, Daejeon, Jeonju, and other places.

　　In many polling stations, the Syngman Rhee clique had already stuffed bundles of forged "ballots" supporting Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong, equivalent to 40% of the total number of voters, into the ballot boxes on the evening of the 14th, the day before the "election."

　　In the second polling district of Namgok-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, more than fifty members of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" collectively "represented" all the voters in the district in casting votes for Syngman Rhee.

　　In some places, the Syngman Rhee clique also fabricated ballot boxes with false bottoms, secretly replacing them with all the votes supporting Syngman Rhee.

　　The Syngman Rhee clique's fascist methods and shameless fraud have aroused strong opposition from the South Korean people. Following the demonstration by residents of Masan City on the 15th, another four to five hundred people demonstrated in the streets of Seoul today. A young man gave a speech saying: "We must mobilize and fight against the Liberal Party that murders our compatriots!"

    独裁统治压不住人民的斗争怒火
    南朝鲜群众举行大示威
    李承晚在刺刀支持下又当上伪总统
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜庆尚南道马山市15日下午爆发了数千人民反对李承晚集团制造“选举”的大示威。这一天，是李承晚集团规定进行所谓“总统选举”的日子。
    从下午六时开始，数千名市民和学生包围了李伪马山市政府办公厅，高呼“选举无效”。愤怒的群众放火焚烧了北马山市警察派出所的房子，并且捣毁了另外四个警察派出所和李承晚的自由党市党部。群众还破坏了一辆警察使用的汽车，切断了电线。这个城市到夜晚已陷入完全的黑暗中。
    李承晚集团慌忙地动员了驻扎在当地的全部警察和李伪军，使用催泪弹和水龙疯狂地进行镇压。但是斗争情绪十分高昂的群众一直顽强不屈地同军警搏斗，到15日晚十时半为止，双方有七人死亡，七十三人受伤。
    这一事件发生后，李承晚集团慌乱不堪，他们又把邻近马山地区的警察和李伪军陆军三十九师调来马山，进行残暴的镇压，并从昨晚十时四十分起禁止记者们报道这一事件的真相。与此同时，汉城市在15日也有七百多名市民和学生举行游行示威，反对李承晚集团制造的“选举”。
    另据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，13日中午，有五十多名高等学校学生在美国驻汉城的大使馆前举行示威。他们遭到了李承晚警察的镇压，有十七、八名学生被捕。这一天在汉城以南不远的乌山也有二百多名高等学校的学生举行游行示威，有九名学生被捕。
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：经过一切血腥镇压，李承晚集团包揽了在15日举行的南朝鲜的总统“选举”。据汉城今天广播，自由党的候选人李承晚和李起鹏“当选”为伪总统和伪副总统。
    这是李承晚八年来第二次同一个死人竞选“得胜”。这次唯一和李承晚竞选“总统”的民主党候选人赵炳玉已经在2月15日突然死在美国。李承晚虽然已经没有竞选对手，但是，按照南朝鲜“宪法”的规定，他必须获得三分之一的选票才能当选。李起鹏这次主要的竞选对手仍为民主党的张勉，李起鹏在四年前竞选“副总统”时曾经败于张勉。
    南朝鲜的民主党，民主社会党等在野党已经宣布这次“选举”是“非法和无效的”。
    据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，“这次选举在紧张的气氛和森严的警戒中进行”。每个投票所都有数十名到上百名的武装到牙齿的警察和特务看守，街道上有警察和宪兵骑着马巡逻和监视着选民的一举一动。15日，选民们从清晨起就被强迫编成三人小组带到投票所，在特务组织——“反共青年团”的监视下投
  “支持”李承晚的票。在釜山第二投票所，有的选民由于拒绝投李承晚的票而在事后遭到特务的毒打，据报道，15日有十来个人在“选举”中被打死。为了便于舞弊，李承晚集团派出打手从汉城、春川、铁原、大田、全州等地的投票所内把民主党的“选举”监督人驱逐出去，有的还加以殴打。
    在许多投票所，李承晚集团在“选举”的前一天——14日晚上就把相当于选民总数40％的伪造的支持李承晚和李起鹏的“选票”成捆投进票箱。
    在汉城市中区甲区南谷洞第二投票区，五十多名“反共青年团”竟集体“代理”这个区的全部选民投李承晚的票。
    有的地方，李承晚集团还制造了活底“票箱”，暗中换上全部支持李承晚的票。
    李承晚集团这种法西斯手段和无耻的舞弊，激起了南朝鲜人民的强烈反对。继15日马山市居民举行示威之后，今天在汉城又有四、五百名群众在大街上示威。一个青年讲演说：“要总动员起来，同杀害同胞的自由党战斗”。
