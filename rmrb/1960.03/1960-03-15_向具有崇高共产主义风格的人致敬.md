    Saluting Those with Lofty Communist Style
    ·Southern Daily Reporters and Correspondents Collective Writing·
    On February 26th, a fire broke out at the Makou Paper Mill in Yingde County, Guangdong Province. Forty-nine public security cadres and people's police officers stationed at the Makou Pyrite Mine bravely rescued state property. Due to the explosion of oil drums, twelve people sacrificed their lives, and the rest were all injured. The Party and the government mobilized all forces to rescue the injured comrades. Relevant departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places promoted a noble communist style and did their best to support the rescue. This is another triumphant song of communism. Dozens of police officers and cadres rushed into the fire to save state property.
    At around 5:40 PM on February 26th, the public security cadres and people's police officers stationed at the Makou Pyrite Mine in Yingde County had just finished dinner. Some were bathing, and some were chatting and laughing. Suddenly, a police officer brought an urgent message:
    "A fire has broken out at Ximiao!"
    The police officers and cadres quickly gathered. Jiang Wenxiong, the deputy district captain of the police detachment, and Ma Delin, the squad leader of the mining workshop, said to everyone: "We are the people's police, and we cannot stand by and watch the people's property suffer losses. The mine leaders have decided to immediately organize a rescue team. Whoever wants to go, please sign up!"
    Everyone stood up and said, "I'll go! I'll go!"
    Forty-nine police officers and cadres were approved to join the firefighting team. Gao Junsheng, the deputy director of the workshop who had fractured his hand bone during a mission, also took a hoe and became a temporary firefighter.
    They ran the seven-mile distance in just twenty minutes and arrived at the scene. They saw that the fierce fire had engulfed three buildings of the Makou Paper Mill. One barrel of diesel had already exploded. They rushed into the fire without delay.
    Bucket after bucket of mud and sand was poured onto the flames, and the fire near the oil drums gradually died down. The motor was rescued, and several barrels of diesel were also about to be rescued. Unexpectedly, at this moment, another barrel of diesel that had been overheated for too long exploded. Fierce flames burst in all directions, shooting at the heroic people's police. Deng Guangfu, Ruan Enyu, and twelve other police officers gave their glorious lives to save state property; the rest were all burned and collapsed on the ground.
    The Good Police and Good Cadres Who Gave Their Lives for State Property Must Be Saved.
    After the diesel explosion, the flames burned fiercely again. There were still unexploded diesel barrels in the fire, and people had to be evacuated quickly. Slightly injured police officers first took on this responsibility. Police officer Zhang Beixian, who was knocked to the ground by the explosion, had his clothes and hat on fire. He took off his clothes and hat, jumped into a nearby stream to extinguish the flames on his body, and ignored his injured feet to rush back into the fire to rescue his comrades. He saw Lai Zhiheng, a clerk from the mining workshop, engulfed in flames, so he dragged him into the water and then turned around to save Zhong Guanshui, using his own clothes to put out the flames on Zhong Guanshui's body. He selflessly went in and out of the fire three times to rescue his comrades, and when he rescued the fourth comrade, he fainted halfway.
    Kong Qingsheng, a fifty-three-year-old communist party member and deputy squad leader of the mining workshop, had his hands swollen from burns, yet he still ran into the fire to take off the clothes of comrades who were on fire. Jiang Wenxiong, the deputy district captain, had his hands burned, and he also ran into the fire again and again to find his comrades and direct the rescue. His comrades repeatedly advised him to leave the fire, but he said firmly, "No, the Party told me to lead the team here, and I must be the last to leave!"
    The members of the people's commune also rushed to help with the rescue after hearing the news. Some members brought out bed boards and door panels from their homes to use as temporary stretchers. A little over an hour after the incident...
    The news of the fire and injuries quickly reached the county committee. Liu Zhixiang, the first secretary of the county committee, said decisively: "Saving people is the priority now. We must immediately mobilize for rescue work!" Then he immediately left the office and, together with Feng Ping, the secretary of the county committee, drove straight to Makou in a jeep...
    Many telephones simultaneously transmitted the county committee's mobilization order: "Bus station, immediately stop all transportation and concentrate the vehicles in Makou to rescue the wounded..."
    "People's Hospital, immediately send medical personnel to Makou..."
    A little over an hour after the incident, all the injured had been sent to the hospital.
    In the county people's hospital, several county committee secretaries and doctors were carrying out rescue work together. Secretary Liu said to all the medical staff: "You must do everything possible to rescue them. The Party committee supports you. If you need people, we'll provide people; if you need skin, we'll provide skin; if you need blood, we'll provide blood..."
    The Party cares about the injured who shed blood to save state property. The situation was immediately reported to the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee of the CPC. Zheng Xingyan, the first secretary of the prefectural committee, immediately convened a temporary meeting of secretaries and commissioners and decided to send the best cars and drivers, and the best doctors to Yingde County to participate in the rescue work. The situation was quickly reported to the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC. Under the direction of the provincial committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Medical College in Guangzhou immediately sent doctors and nurses to Yingde County to participate in the rescue.
    To help the injured through the shock, blood transfusions must be administered immediately. Many county cadres, workers, farmers, students, residents... flocked to the hospital from all directions, forming a blood donation team of more than two thousand people, stretching from the hospital all the way to the street. They competed to donate their blood to the injured. The first to donate blood was Deputy County Head Su Hongjiong.
    Time passed second by second. At Yingde Hospital, medical staff worked tirelessly all night, never leaving their posts. The patients who were already staying in the hospital, upon hearing that these burn patients had arrived, asked the doctors to quickly go and participate in the rescue work, and they took care of themselves. Late at night, a large number of medical personnel from all the factories, mines, farms, communes, and troops in Yingde County rushed over. Doctors sent by Shaoguan Prefecture and the province also arrived to help.
    Now, the most precious thing is medicine. A telegram, sent by a specialist from Shaoguan City, arrived overnight. It was not enough, and more needed to be replenished immediately. At three o'clock in the morning, Zhang Wenting, a cadre from the Yingde County Pharmaceutical Company, rushed to Shaoguan to purchase medicine. He ran breathlessly to the train station, but the train was about to leave, and the ticket seller refused to sell him a ticket.
    "I need to go to Shaoguan to buy medicine to save the injured!"
    Hearing that it was to rescue the burned police officers and cadres, the ticket seller said: "Hurry up and get on the train first, and I'll make up your ticket for you!"
    The train carried Zhang Wenting to Shaoguan City, arriving at four o'clock. He went to the warehouse of the Shaoguan Procurement and Supply Station of Guangdong Pharmaceutical Company and knocked on the door. The storekeeper, Chen Fuxian, had just fallen asleep. Hearing that the person knocking was there to rescue the injured, he immediately opened the door, turned on the lights, and looked for the medicine according to the purchase order. Then, he personally rode a tricycle and delivered the medicine to the train station.
    To transport the injured to Guangzhou as quickly as possible, the county committee called the Yingde Railway Station, which in turn called the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, requesting that the southbound train stop at Yingde Station to carry the injured. The duty director of the Railway Bureau immediately instructed: "Stop for as long as needed!" The "Peace" express train from Beijing to the south extended its stop at Yingde Station from thirteen minutes to over an hour, waiting for the injured to board before departing. More than ten stations along the way opened green signals for the train, allowing it to speed towards Guangzhou...
    The Medical Team from Guangzhou
    On the evening of the 26th, at nearly ten o'clock, Zhang Wenbin, the director of the Provincial Health Department's office, was reading documents in his dormitory when the phone rang. It was a call from the Provincial Committee. "What?...Dozen of people are injured in Yingde County. We need to send people for emergency treatment. Take the 11:20 train...OK, organize people immediately..." With just over an hour before the train left, Zhang Wenbin was extremely nervous. After hanging up, he made a series of phone calls to various hospitals from the Health Department dormitory.
    The communists of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital had just finished their party meeting and returned to the hospital when they received Zhang Wenbin's notification. Liang Xiquan, the deputy secretary and deputy director of the Party Branch, immediately made an emergency mobilization to organize a rescue medical team. The situation of the injured was not yet known in detail, so a complete set of surgical staff and equipment had to be prepared. All the hospital's medical staff and employees were mobilized. Liang Xiquan decided to lead the team to Yingde himself. More than a dozen nurses in the operating room, upon hearing that people were being sent to rescue the soldiers who were injured for state property, rushed into the operating room regardless of whether they were off duty or on duty, packing medicines and equipment while requesting to be sent themselves. Luo Aizhen, who was on duty, picked up the duty nurse's basket and said, "I am ready, just approve me to go!" Her request was finally approved. After more than half an hour of arrangement, a medical rescue team of fourteen people, including internal and external doctors and nurses, set off. Boxes of medicines and equipment were sent to the prepared emergency vehicle early, and just as it was about to leave, someone suddenly got into the car. Everyone looked and saw that it was Wu Guangxi, an attending surgeon. He had just finished surgery for a patient, working hard all night and one day, and had just gone to bed when he heard the news of the rescue. He hurriedly got out of bed, not even bothering to put on his coat, and rushed over.
    The ambulance drove to the train station, and the train was whistling, seemingly about to leave. At this moment, a comrade waiting for them at the station said to the medical team: "Are you going to Yingde? All the procedures have been completed, get on the train, it's just waiting for you to leave!" Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. On this train, there were also two doctors from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Medical College, who were also rushing to Yingde to participate in the rescue work.
  Hospitals in all departments cooperate to rescue class brothers
    It was decided to transfer some of the more seriously injured class brothers from Yingde to the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Medical College and the Army Hospital in Guangzhou for treatment. As soon as this news was transmitted from Yingde to Guangzhou, all hospitals immediately made all preparations for them. It was the first time that the Provincial People's Hospital had accepted such a large number of burn patients, and they did not originally have a specially established isolated burn ward, but in order to rescue the lives of class brothers, they took on the task. But time was so tight, and the task was to convert several ordinary wards into isolation rooms in a few hours. At this time, the entire hospital was mobilized, and administrative staff also worked as temporary carpenters and masons, and many medical staff personally participated in the disinfection work. Finally, before the injured arrived, they had prepared everything. All departments of surgery transferred doctors with the most experience in rescuing burns to work in the burn ward, and each department concentrated the best nurses in the ward area. Li Lianqiong, a "five-good party member" and head nurse who had studied the experience of rescuing Qiu CaiKang in Shanghai, was also transferred from other departments. The First People's Hospital, Workers' Hospital, and Red Cross Hospital of Guangzhou City all sent doctors and nurses to participate in the work.
    The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Medical College, although there was a burn area and experience in treating burn patients, it was the first time to accept a whole batch of burn patients at once. In order to strengthen medical strength, they specially transferred Wang Jifu, the attending physician with experience in treating burns, from other departments. Kuang Gongdao, the director of surgery, had been suffering from stomach problems these days, and the leaders decided to give him a vacation. At this time when manpower was most needed, he took the initiative to ask the leaders to revoke this decision and personally went to the ward to participate in the rescue.
    Doctors and nurses guarded the wounded's beds, spending many days and nights. The strong will of the wounded greatly encouraged them and made them forget their fatigue. When the leaders came to comfort the wounded, some of the wounded had difficulty speaking, but they still used all their strength to say: "Leaders, don't worry, we're fine." They never moaned about their pain, and in a semi-coma, they still kept thinking about saving state property. These facts educated the doctors and nurses, and they all did everything they could to save the lives of these strong people!
    When the General Hospital of the Army stationed in Guangzhou troops heard the news, the entire hospital immediately took the initiative to propose to take some of the injured class brothers to the hospital for treatment. After the patients arrived at the hospital, in addition to specialized medical staff being responsible, consultations with the directors of various departments were held every day.
    In order to rescue the injured class brothers, all departments of the hospital vigorously cooperated. Each patient had to undergo dozens of tests every day, such as blood routine, blood chloride, and urination. The staff of the testing laboratory worked day and night. The blood bank ensured that whole blood was available when whole blood was needed, and plasma was available when plasma was needed; the nutrition room had someone specifically in charge of the nutrition of burn patients, trying every means to make things that the patients liked to eat to increase their physical strength.
    Give what is needed
    On the afternoon of March 2, the cadres of the Guangdong Provincial Materials Bureau were studying. Suddenly, two uninvited guests wanted to find the bureau chief to discuss important matters. The bureau chiefs had all gone to a meeting, and Lin San, the deputy director of the office, received the guests. These two guests were Cha Shulan and Zhao Qingkun, the vice presidents of the Provincial People's Hospital, who came to look for oxygen cylinders and glass, slippers, cotton cloth, iron window screens, and wood for the isolation room.
    Lin San said without waiting for the two presidents to explain the reasons in detail, "I understand everything, what else do you need, just ask, we will definitely do our best to do it." The study was immediately stopped, and some went to this warehouse to extract oxygen cylinders, and some went to that warehouse to extract glass. Timber, slippers, cotton cloth, etc. were managed by other units, and Lin San called these units, hoping that they would do their best to assist in the rescue work. When Cha Shulan arrived at the Provincial Planning Commission, a section chief greeted him and said, "We just received a notice from the Materials Bureau that you need timber, go to the Timber Management Office to pick it up immediately!" The Timber Management Office immediately extracted a part of the timber waiting for construction to support the Provincial People's Hospital. In order to rescue class brothers, whichever unit was requested, that unit strongly supported it. The cadres of the Provincial Textile Products Department sent batch after batch of cloth to the cars of the Provincial People's Hospital; the Provincial Department of Department Stores sent slippers; the Provincial Production Materials Department sent iron window screens, and everything the hospital needed was supplied. They also repeatedly stated: "For the sake of the injured, we will do our best to support them!"
    Plasma sent from thousands of miles away
    Patients with large-area burns need a large amount of blood to replenish. All units that knew this news posted many large-character posters, requesting blood donation. The Provincial Health Department and its directly affiliated units, from leading comrades to all personnel, signed up to donate blood, and the medical staff of the Provincial People's Hospital also posted large-character posters requesting blood donation. More than a dozen medical staff from all over the country who were studying at Zhongshan Medical College also jointly requested blood donation. These days, more than 100 employees of the Provincial People's Hospital have donated their blood to their class brothers; the people of Yingde County have also sent 120,000 cc of blood.
    Burn patients also need plasma, but various hospitals did not have time to prepare it for a while. Zhao Qingkun, vice president of the Provincial People's Hospital, had previously worked at Nanjing First People's Hospital, and she thought that some solutions might be found there. So, on the evening of the 29th, she sent a telegram to Nanjing First People's Hospital, requesting the transfer of plasma. After receiving the telegram, Nanjing First People's Hospital replied with a long-distance call the next morning, saying that it would be sent by plane with the flight at 3 pm. However, the blood transfusion station in Nanjing City, which was responsible for supplying plasma, had just run out of plasma, and it would take three days to make it again. The staff of the blood transfusion station considered: "How can it be done if we have to wait for three days?" They came up with a solution: to send the unfinished plasma separately to various hospitals, and exchange it with the finished plasma that each hospital had. In this way, a total of 20,400 cc were extracted. When the staff was anxiously waiting for the plasma, a message suddenly came: "Today's flight will not be operating." Everyone's mood became even more tense.
    Nanjing First Hospital immediately reported this situation to the higher levels and received the support of the CPC Nanjing Municipal Committee, which decided to ask Shanghai to send a special plane to help send the plasma to Guangzhou. At dawn the next day, the plane left Nanjing City, crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, and landed in Guangzhou after four hours. When the plane left the sky over Nanjing City, the broad masses of Nanjing City knew the news and went to the blood transfusion station to request blood donation. In order to support their class brothers, 200 people had already donated blood and continued to support Guangzhou.
    Cadres from medical departments across the country who were participating in the National Third Category Materials Exchange Conference in Guangzhou learned the news from the Provincial Pharmaceutical Department and tried every means to provide support. A cadre from the Medical Bureau of the Health Department of the Central Military Commission made a special phone call back, and the next day, 1,250 cc of plasma was transported by plane from Beijing. The staff of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Station knew that glucose solution was a necessary drug for rescuing burn patients, took the initiative to contact Shanghai, and urgently transferred 400 bottles of glucose solution to Guangzhou.
    In our country, when some people encounter difficulties, how many people reach out their hands of friendship and assistance to them. Now, after rescue, most of these thirty-seven class brothers have escaped danger, and nineteen people have returned to their jobs. Let us learn from these people with lofty communist styles and salute them! (With pictures)

    向具有崇高共产主义风格的人致敬
    ·南方日报记者和通讯员集体采写·
    2月26日，广东省英德县马口造纸厂失火，驻马口硫铁矿的四十九名公安干部和人民警察，奋勇抢救国家财产，因油桶爆炸，有十二个人献出生命，其余全部负伤。党和政府动员了一切力量抢救负伤的同志，北京、上海、南京等地的有关部门，都发扬了崇高的共产主义风格，尽力支援抢救。这又是一曲共产主义的凯歌。为了抢救国家财产，几十名民警和干部冲进火海
    2月26日下午五时四十分左右，驻在英德县马口硫铁矿的公安干部和人民警察刚吃过晚饭，有的在洗澡，有的在谈笑。忽然，一位警察传来急促的声音：
    “西庙起火啦！”
    警察和干部迅速集中，民警队副区队长蒋文雄和采矿车间分队长马德林向大家说：“我们是人民的警察，不能眼看人民财产受损失，矿的领导决定立刻组织抢救队伍。谁愿去，请报名！”
    所有的人都站出来说：“我去！我去！”
    四十九名民警和干部被批准参加这支救火队伍。曾经在执行任务中跌断过手骨的车间副主任高俊升，也拿着锄头，当上临时的消防队员。
    他们仅用二十分钟便跑完了七里的路程，赶到了出事地点。他们看见烈火烧着了马口造纸厂的三幢房子，刚才已经爆炸了一桶柴油，他们急不及待地就往火场里冲。
    一桶一桶的泥沙，撒在火焰上，油桶附近的火，逐渐熄灭了。马达抢救出来了，几桶柴油眼看也快抢救出来了。不料在这个时刻，又有一桶受热过久的柴油爆炸。凶恶的火焰四处迸射，射向英勇的人民警察的身上。邓光福、阮恩裕等十二位民警，为抢救国家的财产献出了光辉的生命；其余全部被烧伤，晕倒在地上。要救出为了国家财产而献身的好民警、好干部
    柴油爆炸后，火焰又猛烈地燃烧起来。火场内还有未爆炸的柴油，必须赶快把人们救出去。轻伤的警察首先把这个责任担当起来。被震倒在地上的警察张北先，上衣和帽子都着了火，他把衣帽一脱，跳进附近的小溪里，淹灭身上的火，脚?伤了也不顾，又重新冲进火海里抢救战友。他见到采矿车间的文书赖智恒全身着火，便把他拖进水里，转过身又去救钟观水，用自己的衣服来扑灭钟观水身上的火苗。他这样忘我地三进三出抢救战友，当把第四个战友抢救出来的时候，走到半途就昏迷过去了。
    五十三岁的共产党员、采矿车间副中队长孔庆升，双手被烧肿了，他还跑进火场里替烧着了衣服的同志脱去衣服。副区队长蒋文雄双手被烧伤，也一次又一次地跑到火场里，寻找战友，指挥抢救。同志们再三劝他离开火场，他斩钉截铁地说：“不能，党叫我把队伍领来，我一定要最后离开！”
    人民公社的社员听到消息后，也纷纷赶来协助抢救。一些社员把家里的床板和门板拿出来作临时担架。在事情发生的一个多小时后……
    起火和伤人的消息，很快传到了县委会，县委第一书记刘志祥斩钉截铁地说：“现在救人要紧，必须立刻动员进行抢救工作！”接着马上走出办公室，同县委书记冯平等乘吉普车直奔马口……。
    许多部电话机同时传出县委的动员令：“汽车站，立即停止一切载运，把汽车集中到马口抢救伤员……”
    “人民医院，立即派出医务人员到马口……”
    在事情发生的一个多小时后，全部伤员已经送到医院了。
    在县人民医院里，几位县委书记和医生一道进行着抢救工作。刘书记对全体医护人员说：“你们必须想尽一切办法抢救，党委支持你们，要人有人，要皮给皮，要血给血……”
    党关心着为抢救国家财产而流血的伤员们。情况立刻报告了中共韶关地委会，地委第一书记郑星燕立即召开书记、专员的临时会议，决定派出最好的汽车、最好的司机，送最好的医生到英德县参加抢救工作。情况很快又报告了中共广东省委员会。在省委指示下，广州市的广东省人民医院、中山医学院第一附属医院，立即派出医生和护士前往英德县参加抢救。
    为了帮助伤员度过休克关，必须立即输补血液。英德县许多机关干部、工人、农民、学生、居民……从四面八方涌向医院去，组成了二千多人的输血队伍，从医院一直排到大街。他们争着要把自己的血液，输送到伤员的身上。第一个输血的是副县长苏鸿炯。
    时间一分一秒地过去了，在英德医院里，医护人员整夜不眠地抢救，不离开自己的岗位一步。原来住在医院的伤病员，听到这些烧伤病员来到，请求医生赶快去参加抢救工作，他们自己照料自己。深夜，英德县所有工矿、农场、公社和部队的大批医务人员，都赶来了，韶关专区和省派来支援的医生也赶来了。
    现在，最宝贵的东西是药。一个电报，韶关市星夜派专人送来了。还不够用，要马上补充。凌晨三点钟，英德县医药公司的干部张文廷赶去韶关采购。他气呼呼地跑到火车站，列车即将开行，售票员拒绝售票。
    “我要到韶关买药，抢救伤员！”
    听说是为了抢救烧伤民警和干部，售票员说：“你赶快先上车，我替你补票！”
    列车把张文廷载到韶关市，已是四时了。他来到广东医药公司韶关采购供应站仓库敲门。保管员陈福先刚睡下不久，听到敲门的人说是为了抢救伤员，立即打开大门，亮了电灯，按采购单找药。接着，又亲自骑了三轮车，把药送去火车站。
    为了最迅速地把伤员运到广州，县委的电话到了英德火车站，英德车站的电话又到了广州铁路局，要求南下的火车在英德站停下来载运伤员。铁路局值班局长马上指示：“需要停多少时间，就停多少时间！”从北京南下的“和平号”特别快车，在英德车站停车的时间，从十三分钟延长到一个多钟头，等到伤员上车后才开。沿途十多个站都为这列列车打开了绿色的讯号，让列车飞驰向广州……从广州来的医疗队
    26日晚上，快到十点钟时，省卫生厅办公室主任张文彬正在宿舍里看文件，电话铃响了，是省委来的电话。“什么？……英德县有几十个人受伤，要派人去急救，坐十一点二十分开的火车，……，好的，马上组织人力，……”。离开车时间只有一个多钟头，张文彬的心情异常紧张，放下电话，就在卫生厅宿舍，向各医院发出一连串的电话。
    广东省人民医院的共产党员们，刚刚开完了党员大会回到医院，便接到了张文彬的通知。党总支副书记、副院长梁锡全马上作紧急动员，组织抢救医疗队。受伤的人的情况还知道得不详细，因此必须准备全套的手术人员和器械。全院医护人员、职工都动员起来了。梁锡全决定亲自带队到英德去。手术室的十多个护士，听说要派人去抢救为国家财产而受伤的战士，不管下了班的还是值着班的，都一齐涌进了手术室，一面收拾药物、器械。一面请求派自己去。正在值班的罗爱珍，她一手挽起了值班护士篮子说：“我准备好啦，就批准我去吧！”她的要求终于得到批准了。经过半小时多的安排，一支包括内外科医生、护士等十四个人的医疗抢救队伍出发了。一箱箱的药物、器械早送上准备好的救急车，在快要开走的时候，一个人又突然钻上车里来了，大家一看，原来是外科主治医生吴光熙。他刚替病人做完了手术，忙过了一个夜晚和一个白天，才上床睡了不久，听到抢救消息，他急忙从床上爬起来，外衣也来不及穿，便赶来了。
    救护车开到火车站，火车在呜呜地叫，看样子是快要开车了。就在这个时候，车站上迎接他们的一位同志对医疗队说：“你们是去英德的吗？一切手续办好了，上车去吧，就等着你们开车啦！”大家才松了一口气。就在这列火车上，还有中山医学院附属第一医院的两位医生，他们也是赶往英德参加抢救工作的。
  为了抢救阶级兄弟医院各部门互相配合
    一部分伤势较重的阶级兄弟，决定从英德转到广州市的广东省人民医院、中山医学院附属第一医院和陆军医院去治疗。这个消息一从英德传到广州，各医院都立刻为他们做好了一切准备工作。省人民医院还是第一次接受这样大量烧伤的病人，他们原来是没有专门设立隔离严密的烧伤病房，为了抢救阶级兄弟的生命，他们把任务承担下来了。但时间这么紧迫，在几个小时内，要把几个普通的病房改装为隔离室。这时，全院都动员起来了，行政人员也当起了临时木工、泥水工，许多医护人员亲自动手参加了消毒工作。终于在伤员还没有到来前，他们已准备好一切了。外科的各个部门都把最有抢救烧伤经验的医生抽调到烧伤病房来工作，各科室也把最优秀的护士集中到病区来。曾经到上海学习过抢救丘财康经验的“五好党员”、护士长李莲琼，也从别的部门调来了。广州市第一人民医院、工人医院、红十字会医院都派出医生和护士来参加工作。
    中山医学院附属第一医院虽然设有烧伤区，也有过治疗烧伤病人的经验。但是，一下子接受整批的烧伤病人还是第一次。为了加强医疗力量，他们特别把治疗烧伤有经验的主治医生王吉甫，从别的部门抽调回来。外科主任邝公道这几天闹胃病，领导决定他休假了，在这个最需要人力的时刻，他主动要求领导撤消这个决定，亲自到病房参加抢救。
    医生、护士守护在伤员的床前，度过了许多个昼夜。伤员们的坚强意志，使他们受到很大的鼓舞，忘记了疲劳。当首长们来慰问伤员的时候，一些伤员说话很困难，但他们还是用尽全身的气力来说：“首长，你们放心吧，我们没有什么。”他们对自己的痛楚，总不哼一声，在半昏迷中还念念不忘抢救国家财产。这些事实教育了医生和护士，他们都尽一切力量来挽救这些坚强的人的生命！
    驻广州部队陆军总医院听到这个消息时，全院人员立即主动提出要把一部分受伤的阶级兄弟接到医院来治疗。当病人到达医院以后，除了有专门医护人员负责之外，每天还举行有各科主任参加的会诊。
    为了抢救受伤的阶级兄弟，医院的各个部门都大力做好配合工作。每个病人每天都要作血常规、血的氯化物、大小便等几十次检验，检验室的工作人员夜以继日地工作着。血库保证做到要全血有全血，要血浆有血浆；营养室专门有人管烧伤病人的营养，多方设法做一些使病人喜爱吃的东西，使他们增强体力。需要什么，给什么
    3月2日下午，广东省物资局的干部们正在学习。突然，两位不速之客要找局长商量要事。局长们都去开会了，办公室副主任林三接待了客人。这两位客人是省人民医院的副院长查树兰和赵庆坤，他们是为了伤员来找氧气瓶和隔离室用的玻璃、拖鞋、棉布、铁窗纱和木材的。
    林三不等到两位院长详细说明原委，就说：“我全明白啦，你们还有什么要求，尽管提出来吧，我们一定尽力去办。”学习马上停止下来了，有的去这个仓库提取氧气瓶，有的去那个仓库提取玻璃。木材、拖鞋、棉布等是其他单位管理的，林三又打电话给这些单位，希望他们尽力协助做好抢救工作。当查树兰到达省计划委员会的时候，一位科长迎接他，说：“我们刚接到物资局的通知，你们需要木材，马上到木材管理处去领吧！”木材管理处立即抽出一部分等着施工用的木材支援省人民医院。为了抢救阶级兄弟，向哪一个单位提出要求，那一个单位便大力支持。省纺织品处干部们把一匹匹的布送上省人民医院的汽车；省百货处送上了拖鞋；省生产资料处送上了铁窗纱，医院需用的一切，都得到供应了。他们还再三地表示：“为了伤者，我们尽力支援！”千里送来的血浆
    大面积烧伤的病人，需要有大量的血液来补充。凡是知道这个消息的单位，都贴出了很多大字报，要求献血。省卫生厅和直属各单位，从领导同志到全体人员都签名献血，省人民医院的医护人员都贴出了要求献血的大字报。在中山医学院进修的来自全国各地的十多名医护人员，也联名要求献血。这些天来，省人民医院已经有一百多位职工把自己鲜血输给了自己的阶级兄弟；英德县的人民也送来了十二万公撮的血液。
    烧伤病人还需用血浆，而各个医院一时都没有来得及准备。省人民医院副院长赵庆坤从前曾在南京第一人民医院工作，她想那里可能想出一些办法来。便在29日晚上，发了一个电报到南京第一人民医院，要求调拨血浆，南京第一人民医院接到电报后，就在第二天早上回了一个长途电话，说下午三点钟就随着班机送来。但是南京市负责供应血浆的输血站，恰巧刚用完了血浆，马上再制也要三天后才行。输血站的工作人员考虑到：“要等三天时间，怎么能行呢？”他们想出一个办法：把未制成的血浆，分别送到各个医院去，和各个医院调换已经制成的血浆。这样，一共抽调出了二万零四百个公撮。工作人员正紧张地为血浆着急的时候，突然，一个消息传来了：“今天的班机不开。”大家的心情更加紧张。
    南京市第一医院马上把这个情况向上级报告，得到中共南京市委的支持，决定请上海派出专机协助把血浆送到广州。第二天凌晨，飞机离开了南京市，越过了千山万水，四个小时后，在广州着陆了。当飞机离开南京市上空时，南京市的广大群众都知道了这个消息，纷纷到输血站要求献血，为了支援自己的阶级兄弟，有二百人已献出了鲜血，继续支援广州。
    正在广州参加全国第三类物资交流大会的来自全国各地医药部门的干部，从省医药处那里知道了消息，都想尽办法来支援。中央军委卫生部医药局一位干部特地挂了电话回去，第二天就从北京用飞机运来了一千二百五十公撮的血浆。上海医药站的工作人员，知道葡萄糖液是抢救烧伤病人必需用的药品，主动和上海联系，把四百瓶的葡萄糖液急调来广州。
    在我们的国家里，当一些人遭遇到困难的时候，有多少人向他伸出了友谊援助的双手。现在，这三十七个阶级兄弟，经过抢救，绝大部分已经脱险，有十九个人已经回到工作岗位。让我们向这些具有崇高共产主义风格的人学习，向他们致敬！（附图片）
