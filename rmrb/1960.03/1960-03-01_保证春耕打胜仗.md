    Guarantee a Victory in Spring Ploughing
    Hanyang County Bus Station, Wang Longyi
    Cars speed like the wind,
    Car horns blare continuously,
    Car lights flash brightly,
    Supporting spring ploughing day and night.
    Not afraid of high mountains or long roads,
    Not afraid of uneven roads,
    Not afraid of mountains of tasks,
    Once the engine starts, difficulties vanish.
    We must transport seeds to the countryside,
    We must send farm tools to the villages,
    We must transport fertilizer to the communes,
    To guarantee a victory in spring ploughing.

    保证春耕打胜仗
    汉阳县汽车站　王隆义
    汽车奔驰快如风
    汽车喇叭响连天
    汽车灯光闪闪亮
    支援春耕日夜忙
    不怕山高和路远
    不怕道路不平坦
    不怕任务堆成山
    马达一响困难完
    要把种籽运农村
    要把农具送下乡
    要把肥料运公社
    保证春耕打胜仗
