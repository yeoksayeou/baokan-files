To establish forestry production bases for all types of forestry products, to establish forestry farms wherever there are bases, and for each forestry farm to strive for high yields.

Basing forestry production, operating forestry through forestry farms, and cultivating fast-growing and high-yielding trees—this is the direction of China's forestry development. The "three-izations" of forestry mark a new stage in China's forestry construction.

Basing forestry production means, based on the requirements of national economic development and the characteristics of various regions, using the favorable conditions of people's communes, through planning and design, rationally arranging the layout of forestry production, delineating regions, concentrating into contiguous areas, and afforesting and cultivating forests in a planned way. Operating forestry through forestry farms means establishing forestry farms in areas with afforestation and silvicultural tasks, setting up full-time personnel, organizing professional teams, and strengthening the management of trees. Cultivating fast-growing and high-yielding trees means, in the process of afforestation and silviculture, implementing the basic technical measures for tree cultivation and management, so that trees grow faster, mature earlier or bear fruit earlier, and increase the yield per unit area. The "three-izations" of forestry are a unified whole, and must be fully and systematically implemented in order to develop forestry production in a faster, better, and more economical way. Only by establishing forestry bases, where trees are concentrated in contiguous areas, facilitating management, can there be a foundation for large-scale forestry farms; only by running forestry farms well can forestry bases be further consolidated and continue to develop; and the standard for running forestry farms well is to achieve fast-growing and high-yielding trees. It can be said that basing is the guiding principle, forestry farm operation is the organizational guarantee, and high yield is the technical guarantee and the goal to strive for. Our slogan is: "Every type of forestry product has a base, forestry farms are established everywhere there is a base, and every forestry farm strives for high yield."

Forestry production is an indispensable and inseparable part of national construction and the commune economy. It is closely related to industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. The speed of forestry production development directly affects the development speed of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives. From the perspective of developing agricultural production, it is urgently necessary to use forests to combat natural disasters. Mountainous and semi-mountainous areas in our country account for more than 70% of the country's total land area, and our country also has a long coastline and large desert areas. These areas, due to the lack of forest cover and protection, often cause serious soil erosion and suffer from wind and sand erosion. Although, since liberation, Chinese people have vigorously managed mountains, rivers, and deserts, the conditions for agricultural production have been greatly improved. However, natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and sand still threaten agricultural production. Vigorously planting trees and forests and establishing shelterbelts is an important measure to avoid and reduce natural disasters and ensure stable agricultural production increases. Forestry also has a great relationship with animal husbandry. Greening barren mountains and sandy land can not only protect and expand pastures, but also increase water and grass resources; the branches, leaves, and fruits of some trees are also good feed for livestock. Therefore, the development of forestry production will inevitably promote the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and the development of animal husbandry will also promote the development of agriculture and forestry. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are interdependent and mutually promote each other, and none is dispensable.

From the perspective of developing industrial production, light industry, heavy industry, transportation, and capital construction all require a large amount of timber and forestry by-products. A coal mine with an annual output of one million tons requires 20,000 cubic meters of mine props every year; laying one kilometer of railway requires 320 cubic meters of timber; more timber is needed to manufacture agricultural machinery and various farm tools; building an ordinary factory building of 1,000 square meters requires 130 cubic meters of timber. In addition, timber is also an important raw material for rayon and papermaking, and forestry chemical products are indispensable materials for light industry, chemical industry, leather making, machinery and other industrial production.

Developing forestry production has a more direct relationship with improving people's lives. Woody oil crops and dried and fresh fruits are favorite non-staple foods for urban and rural people. Rural construction and furniture making also require some timber and paint. In many places, cooking and heating also require firewood and charcoal. At the same time, planting trees and forests has a significant effect on changing the climate and beautifying the environment.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached importance to and cared about the development of forestry production. Like other production departments, China's forestry production has also experienced a continuous great leap forward in recent years. In 1958, the national afforestation area reached 260 million mu, exceeding the total afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan period; in 1959, the national afforestation area reached 280 million mu, exceeding the great leap forward of 1958. Forestry production has developed rapidly, but the requirements of socialist construction for forestry are also getting higher and higher. It is necessary to afforest and cultivate forests on a larger area and in a more planned way, so that more trees can survive, grow faster, and more abundant timber, fruits, and other forest products can be harvested. How can this goal be achieved? Based on the experience of the masses' many years of production practice, especially the experience since the Great Leap Forward, and based on the favorable conditions after the people's communeization, the best method is to realize the "three-izations" of forestry—basing, forestry farm operation, and fast-growing and high-yielding.

Basing forestry production is the product of the people's communes and the starting point for China's large-scale forestry development and construction. The facts in many regions have proved that wherever forestry bases are established, the afforestation work is large-scale, fast-paced, and of good quality. Last year, Hunan Province launched a movement to "learn from Jinlong Mountain and catch up with Jinlong Mountain" to build large-scale timber forests and oil-tea forests. In less than a year, the province has built more than 3,500 Jinlong Mountain-style forests with a total area of more than 8 million mu. From October last year to early February this year, Hebei Province has built more than 1.97 million mu of timber forests for mine props, and established timber forest bases for mine props in major coal mining areas such as Kailuan and Fengfeng. Afforestation is a prerequisite for the development of forestry production, but afforestation is only the first step in forestry production. After having a large number of concentrated and contiguous forestry bases, it is also necessary to strengthen the tending and management of trees. Only by doing a good job in tending and management can trees grow fast and yield high. Commune-run forestry farms and state-owned forestry farms are the best professional organizations for managing and managing trees. With this professional organization of forestry farms, we can strengthen the tending of young forests and the management of mature forests, and we can also prepare for seasonal, mass afforestation movements, such as seed collection and seedling raising. With forestry farms, there is also a position for cultivating technical talents. We can establish high-yield experimental forests and experimental nurseries in forestry farms to discover and cultivate more fast-growing and high-yielding forests, and research and summarize better tending and management methods. With forestry farms, it is also convenient to implement the forestry production policy of developing diversified operations with forestry as the main focus, realizing the combination of forestry and grain, the combination of forestry and sideline occupations, and the combination of forestry and animal husbandry, promoting the development of the entire forest area, and increasing national income and commune accumulation. In short, with forestry farms, we can better achieve fast-growing and high-yielding trees. Trees have always been considered to be slow-growing and low-yielding. For example, Chinese fir, even in the southern provinces with warm climate and abundant rainfall, takes 25 years to mature. Now, because the masses have carried forward the communist style of daring to think and act in the process of afforestation and silviculture, mastered the laws of tree growth, and fully implemented the six basic measures of adapting trees to local conditions, meticulous land preparation, fine varieties and strong seedlings, appropriate close planting, tending and protection, and reforming tools, many places have achieved Chinese fir maturation in ten years or eight years. In addition, various places have also successfully cultivated eucalyptus trees that mature in seven years, paulownia trees that mature in six years, poplar trees and locust trees that mature in five years, and so on. These advanced experiences have broken superstitions and shattered the theory that trees are slow-growing and low-yielding. Carrying out the fast-growing and high-yielding tree movement is a pioneering work of the Chinese people and a major event in the development of forestry production. It is not an expedient measure to solve the current contradiction between the supply and demand of timber and forest products, but the fundamental direction for the development of forestry production in our country. Newly built forest areas should focus on cultivating fast-growing and high-yielding tree species; existing forests should also gradually realize fast-growing and high-yielding trees through forest renewal and transformation.

Spring is the best season for planting trees and forests, and it is also a critical season for completing the annual afforestation tasks. Party organizations at all levels should seize the opportunity, in accordance with the direction of realizing the "three-izations" of forestry, mobilize the masses to actively carry out the spring afforestation movement. Our afforestation and silvicultural work has a certain foundation and has accumulated rich experience. After the realization of people's communeization, it has created extremely favorable conditions for the "three-izations" of forestry. The people's communes are large in scale and public, with strong manpower and material resources, and unified land use. They can comprehensively plan, unify organization and allocate labor in accordance with the policy of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations," concentrating afforestation in contiguous areas and establishing forestry bases. Since 1958, various places have widely carried out the movement to build thousands of mu of forests, ten thousands of mu of forests, oil-tea hills, and walnut ditches, laying the foundation for forestry basing. As long as we strengthen Party leadership, rely on the strong strength of the people's communes, adhere to putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements in a big way, and promote and further develop the advanced experience of afforestation and silviculture, we will surely achieve a major victory in realizing the "three-izations" of forestry in the near future.

    样样林产有基地，处处基地设林场，个个林场搞丰产
    林业生产基地化，林业经营林场化，林木培育速生丰产化——这是我国林业发展的方向。林业的“三化”，标志着我国林业建设走上了一个新的阶段。
    林业生产基地化，就是根据国民经济发展的要求和各地的特点，运用人民公社化的有利条件，经过规划设计，合理地安排林业生产的布局，划定地区，集中成片，有计划地造林育林。林业经营林场化，就是在有造林营林任务的地方，设立林场，设置专职人员，组织专业队伍，加强对林木的经营管理。林木培育速生丰产化，就是在造林营林的过程中，贯彻执行林木培育管理的基本技术措施，使林木加快成长，提前成材或者提前结果，并提高单位面积产量。林业“三化”是一个统一的整体，必须全面系统地贯彻执行，才能使林业生产多快好省地发展起来。只有建立起林业基地，林木集中成片，便于管理，大办林场才有基础；林场办好了，就能使林业基地进一步巩固和继续发展；而办好林场的标准就是实现林木速生丰产。可以说，基地化是纲，林场化是组织保证，丰产化是技术保证，也是奋斗目标。我们的口号是：“样样林产有基地，处处基地设林场，个个林场搞丰产。”
    林业生产是国家建设和公社经济的不可缺少、不可分割的一个重要部分，它同工农业生产以及人民生活都有密切的关系，林业生产发展的快慢，直接影响着工农业生产的发展速度和人民生活的改善程度。从发展农业生产来看，迫切需要运用森林来同自然灾害作斗争。我国山区、半山区的面积占全国土地总面积的70％以上，我国还有很长的海岸线和大片的沙漠地区。这些地区，由于缺乏森林复盖和防护，常常造成严重的水土流失和遭受风沙的侵袭。虽然，解放以后，经过我国人民大力治山、治水、治沙，使农业生产的条件有了很大的改善。但是，水、旱、风、沙等自然灾害，仍然威胁着农业生产。大力植树造林，建立防护林带，是避免和减少自然灾害、保证农业稳定增产的一项重要措施。林业同畜牧业的关系也很大。绿化荒山沙地，既能保护和扩大牧场，也能增加水草资源；有些树木的枝、叶和果实又是牲畜的好饲料。因此，林业生产的发展，必然促进农业和畜牧业的发展，而畜牧业的发展又促进农业和林业的发展，农、林、牧三者相互依存，相互促进，缺一不可。
    从发展工业生产来看，不论轻工业、重工业、交通运输业和基本建设，都需要大量的木材和林副产品。一个年产一百万吨的煤矿，每年需要二万立方米矿柱；铺设一公里铁路，需要三百二十立方米木材；制造农业机械和各种农具需要的木材更多；建造一个一千平方米的普通厂房，需要木材一百三十立方米。此外，木材还是人造纤维和造纸的重要原料，林木化学产品是轻工、化工、制革、机械等工业生产不可缺少的材料。
    发展林业生产对于改善人民生活还有更直接的关系。木本油料榨的油以及干鲜果品等是城乡人民喜爱的副食品。农村建筑、造家具也需要一些木材和油漆。在许多地方，做饭、取暖还需要薪炭。同时，植树造林对改变气候和美化环境都有很重大的作用。
    党中央和毛泽东同志一向重视和关怀林业生产的发展。我国的林业生产也和各个生产部门一样，几年来出现了连续大跃进的局面。1958年，全国造林面积达二亿六千万亩，超过了第一个五年计划期间造林面积的总和；1959年全国造林面积达二亿八千万亩，又超过了大跃进的1958年。林业生产发展得很快，但是社会主义建设事业对林业的要求也越来越高，必须更大面积地、更有计划地营林造林，使树活得更多、长得更快，木材、果实和其它林产品收获得更丰盛。怎样才能达到这个目的呢？根据群众多年生产实践的经验，特别是大跃进以来的经验，根据人民公社化以后的有利条件，最好的方法就是实现林业“三化”——基地化，林场化，速生丰产化。
    林业生产基地化，是人民公社的产物，也是我国林业大发展、大建设的起点。许多地区的事实证明，哪里建立起了林业基地，那里的造林工作就规模大，进度快、质量好。湖南省去年掀起了“学金龙山、赶金龙山”营造大面积用材林和油茶林的运动，不到一年的时间，全省已营造金龙山式林三千五百多处，总面积八百多万亩。河北省从去年10月到今年2月上旬，已营造矿柱用材林一百九十七万多亩，并在开滦、峰峰等主要煤矿区建立了矿柱用材林基地。造林是林业生产发展的先决条件，但是，造林只是林业生产的第一步，有了大量集中成片的林业基地以后，还必须加强林木的抚育管理。只有把抚育管理工作做好了，才能使树木速生丰产。社办林场和国营林场是经营管理林木最好的专业组织。有了林场这个专业组织，既可以加强幼林的抚育和成林的管理，又可以为季节性、群众性的造林运动做好采种、育苗等准备工作。有了林场，也就有了培养技术人材的阵地。可以在林场建立丰产试验林和试验苗圃，发现和培育更多的速生丰产林，研究总结更好的抚育管理方法等等。有了林场，还便于实行以林为主发展多种经营的林业生产方针，实现林粮结合、林副结合、林牧结合，促进整个林区生产的发展，增加国家收入和公社的积累。总而言之，有了林场，就能够更好地实现林木速生丰产。林木一向被人们认为是慢生低产的，比如杉木，即使在气候温暖、雨量充沛的南方各省，也需要二十五年才能成材。现在，由于群众在造林营林的过程中，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，掌握了林木生长的规律，全面地执行了适地适树、细致整地、良种壮苗、适当密植、抚育保护、改革工具等六项基本措施，很多地方实现了杉木十年、八年成材。此外各地还培育成功了七年成材的桉树、六年成材的泡桐、五年成材的杨树和洋槐等等。这些先进经验，破除了迷信，打破了林木慢生低产论。开展林木速生丰产运动，是我国人民的一项创举，是发展林业生产的一件大事，它不是解决当前木材和林产品供求矛盾的权宜之计，而是我国发展林业生产的根本方向。新建的林区，应该以营造速生丰产林种为主；现有森林，也要通过森林更新和改造，逐步实现林木速生丰产化。
    春季是植树造林的最好季节，也是完成全年造林任务的关键季节，各级党组织应该抓紧时机，按照实现林业“三化”的方向，发动群众积极开展春季造林运动。我国的造林营林的工作已经有了一定的基础，积累了丰富的经验。实现人民公社化以后，更给林业“三化”创造了极为有利的条件。人民公社一大二公，组织规模大，人力物力雄厚，土地统一利用，可以按照“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营”的方针，统筹规划，统一组织和调配劳力，集中成片地造林，建立林业基地。 1958年以来，各地广泛开展了营造千亩林、万亩林、油茶山、核桃沟的运动，给林业基地化打下了基础。只要加强党的领导，依靠人民公社的强大力量，坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，推广和进一步发展造林营林的先进经验，就一定能够在不久的将来取得实现林业“三化”的重大胜利。
