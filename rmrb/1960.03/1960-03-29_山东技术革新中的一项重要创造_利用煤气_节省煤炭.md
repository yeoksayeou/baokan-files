A Major Innovation in Shandong's Technological Revolution
Utilizing Gas to Save Coal
Experience proves: Adopting new gas technology can widely use low-quality coal, greatly reduce coal consumption, shorten firing time, improve product quality, improve working conditions, and reduce product costs.

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) A mass movement to promote the use of gas is being widely carried out in all walks of life in Shandong Province, and it has achieved significant results.
    The utilization of gas is a major technological innovation in coal combustion and also a major technological innovation in the comprehensive utilization of coal. This major technological innovation, after appraisal by provincial leading organs and relevant scientific departments, has proven to have the following major benefits: First, production is no longer restricted by the quality of coal. In the past, many enterprises could only use high-quality coal. After the implementation of indigenous gas generators, low-quality coal can be widely used, and coal consumption can generally be reduced by 30% to 50%. It is estimated that after the promotion of gas utilization in Shandong Province alone, 1.8 million tons of coal can be saved this year; second, the firing time is shortened, and the product quality is guaranteed. When coal is directly burned in kilns, the temperature inside the kiln is difficult to control evenly, and the product quality is not easily guaranteed, and the firing time is also prolonged. After using gas combustion, the temperature is uniform and easy to control, so the product quality is guaranteed. After Jinan Tonglixing File Factory used gas for production, the hardness of the product was higher than that of high-carbon steel used before, thereby saving a lot of high-quality steel. After Yantai Bearing Factory used gas to treat ball bearings, the product qualification rate reached 100%; third, labor conditions and environmental hygiene have been improved. In the past, coal addition workers added coal and removed ash under high temperatures all day long, and the labor intensity was very high. After using gas, high-temperature operations are eliminated, thus reducing labor intensity. At the same time, the reduction of coal ash due to gas burning has greatly improved the environmental sanitation of factories and cities; fourth, due to the reduction of coal consumption and the improvement of product quality, the product cost has been reduced, generally by 10% to 30%, and some can even be reduced by 50%.
    Since the successful trial of gas firing kilns by Zibo Porcelain Factory last year, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has attached great importance to it, and held an on-site meeting in October last year to pilot the promotion in some industries throughout the province. In January of this year, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee formally issued a decision to universally promote this advanced experience throughout the province, requiring all walks of life to take immediate action, fully mobilize the masses, and regard the promotion of gas utilization as the main measure to save coal, and requiring all industries to formulate specific promotion plans to achieve results in the short term, and strive to comprehensively realize gasification in the first half of the year. The municipal and prefectural party committees and relevant departments have resolutely implemented the decision of the Provincial Party Committee, and have successively established leading groups for the promotion of gas and corresponding offices, and formulated specific promotion plans for various regions and industries. Responsible cadres in all regions and industries throughout the province personally took command, focusing on the progress of furnace construction, the quality of furnace construction, the supply of raw materials, technical guidance, safety, and energy-saving effects. During the process of furnace construction, the broad masses of workers put forward the slogan of action: "If we don't have technology, everyone will study hard; if we don't have time, we will work in our spare time; if we don't have materials, we will find substitutes; everything is for gasification." Many workers used holidays or other spare time to complete the task of furnace construction in a few days and nights. In terms of operating technology, many units have gradually mastered the operating technology of gas furnaces from the process of learning by doing, and put forward four determinations (determining the furnace, determining the personnel, determining the operating procedures, and determining the shift handover system), six diligences (diligently watching the fire, diligently stoking the fire, diligently waving the material, diligently punching the material, diligently removing ash and slag, and diligently contacting the boiler), and three combinations (leading cadres, technicians, and the masses of workers) operating system to ensure the normal operation of the furnace. As of March 15, statistics showed that more than 11,000 gas generators have been built in the province, and more than 8,000 have been put into production.
    According to the practice of Shandong's active promotion of gas utilization in the first quarter of this year, the gas produced by the indigenous gas generator can not only be used to fire ceramics, glass, bricks, tiles, and refractory materials, but also to burn boilers, reverberatory furnaces, carry out forging and metal heat treatment, as well as burn lime, burn cement, burn calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, burn ore, bake steel, iron ladle, burn hot air kilns, melt iron, generate electricity, and even start internal combustion engines mixed with liquid fuels. Many canteens in organs, schools, streets, and people's communes also widely use gas to cook and prepare meals.
    At present, the mass movement to promote gas utilization in this province is developing more widely. The future trend is: on the one hand, the scattered small gas generators will be further developed into larger gas stations; on the other hand, from indigenous to foreign, we will engage in comprehensive coal utilization and strive to recover coal tar in the short term to create more wealth for the country.

    山东技术革新中的一项重要创造
    利用煤气　节省煤炭
    经验证明：采用煤气新技术，可以广泛使用低质煤，大大降低煤耗，缩短烧成时间，提高产品质量，改善劳动条件，降低产品成本
    本报讯　山东省各行各业普遍展开推广煤气利用的群众运动，已收到显著效果。
    利用煤气是煤炭燃烧方面的一项重大技术革新，也是煤炭综合利用方面的一项重大技术革新。这一重大技术革新经过省级领导机关和有关科学部门的鉴定，证明有以下几大好处：一、生产上可不再受煤质的限制。过去许多企业只能用优质煤，推行土煤气发生炉以后，就可以广泛使用低质煤，而且一般均能降低煤耗30％到50％。据估算，仅山东一个省推广煤气利用以后，今年就可以节约煤炭一百八十万吨；二、缩短了烧成时间，保证了产品质量。用煤直接烧窑，窑内温度很难控制均匀，产品质量不容易保证，烧成时间也要延长。采用煤气燃烧后，温度均匀，容易控制，因此产品质量得到了保证。济南同立兴制锉厂利用煤气生产以后，产品硬度比以前用高炭钢还高，从而节约了大量优质钢材。烟台轴承厂采用煤气处理滚珠以后，产品合格率达到了100％；三、改善了劳动条件和环境卫生。过去加煤工人整天在高温下加煤除灰，劳动强度很大。采用煤气以后，解除了高温作业，因此减轻了劳动强度。同时，由于烧煤气减少了煤灰，大大改善工厂和城市的环境卫生；四、由于煤耗的降低和产品质量的提高，因而降低了产品成本，一般均在10％到30％，有的甚至可以降低50％。
    自从去年淄博瓷厂试验用煤气烧窑成功以后，中共山东省委就给予极大的重视，并于去年10月召开现场会议，在全省部分行业中试点推行。今年1月，省委、省人委又正式发出在全省范围内普遍推广这一先进经验的决定，要求各行各业，立即行动起来，充分发动群众，把推广利用煤气作为节约煤炭的主要措施，并要求各行业订出具体推广计划，在短期内收到效果，力争上半年全面实现煤气化。各市、地委和有关部门都坚决贯彻省委这一决定，先后成立了推广煤气领导小组和相应的办事机构，并制订出各地区、各行业的具体推广计划。全省各个地区和各行各业都由负责干部亲自挂帅，大抓建炉进度、建炉质量、原材物料供应、技术指导、安全和节约效果。广大职工在建炉过程中，纷纷提出“没有技术大家钻，没有时间业余干，没有材料找代挖，一切为了煤气化”的行动口号。很多职工，利用假期或其他业余时间，突击几昼夜完成建炉任务。在操作技术上，不少单位从边做边学的摸索过程中，逐步掌握了煤气炉的操作技术，提出了四定（定炉、定员、定操作规程、定交接班制度），六勤（看火勤、拨火勤、挥料勤、打钎勤、落灰除渣勤、与锅炉上联系勤），三结合（领导干部、技术人员和工人群众）的操作制度，保证了炉子的正常运行。截至3月15日统计，全省已经建成煤气发生炉一万一千多座，已经投入生产的有八千座以上。
    根据今年第一季度山东积极推广煤气利用的实践证明，土法煤气发生炉所产生的煤气，不仅能烧制陶瓷、玻璃、砖瓦和耐火材料，还能烧锅炉、反射炉，进行锻造和金属热处理，以及烧石灰，烧水泥，烧制钙镁磷肥，烧矿石、烘烤钢、铁水包，烧热风窑，化铁，发电以至和液体燃料混合发动内燃机。不少机关、学校、街道和人民公社的食堂，也广泛利用煤气，烧饭做菜。
    目前，这个省推广煤气利用的群众运动，正在更广泛地发展着。今后的趋势是：一方面使分散的小煤气发生炉，进一步向较大型的煤气站方面发展；一方面，是由土到洋，大搞煤炭综合利用，争取在短期内能回收煤焦油，为国家创造更多的财富。
