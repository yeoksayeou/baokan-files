Handing Over the Keys to Her
Liu Feng

Shanghai female worker Li Yingdi, seeing that the family service station worker Liu Yufeng did everything earnestly, meticulously, and thoughtfully, treated Liu Yufeng as one of her own family and handed over the house keys to Liu Yufeng. When handing over the keys, Li Yingdi solemnly said to Liu Yufeng:

"You are the head of the household sent by the Party. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party truly care for us. I will definitely do a good job in production."

These few words were spoken with such sincerity, earnestness, and filled with boundless gratitude and trust. Handing over the keys seems like a small matter; however, this small matter reflects the tremendous change in the relationship between people in the new era. Mutual care, mutual help, and mutual trust, this is the new type of relationship between people in the socialist big family, and it is also a characteristic of our entirely new era. Currently, in the tide of organizing the people's economic life in many cities, there are truly thousands upon thousands of service workers like Comrade Liu Yufeng who are trusted by the people.

People trust the service workers so much and entrust them with full power as housekeepers, and there is sufficient reason for this. This is because the service workers are new types of people with a noble communist style and are completely trustworthy. Look at Liu Yufeng: When Qiao Xiulan, a female worker from the No. 21 State Cotton Mill, was recuperating at home due to arthritis, Liu Yufeng went to her home to provide services. In the morning, she would take her children to school, buy groceries, fetch water, and empty the chamber pot for her. When she saw dirty clothes, she would take them away and wash them. Isn't this selfless work attitude of doing whatever needs to be done, completely disregarding conditions and personal gain or loss, a concrete manifestation of a high degree of communist ideological consciousness? Liu Yufeng has to wash thirty-two chamber pots every morning, send a batch of children to school, and provide door-to-door service to thirteen families. When she has free time, she also helps the laundry group with washing, sewing sock bottoms, and making shoes. Although she does a lot of work, because she often attends meetings and does not record work points, her salary is one-third to one-half less than other service workers. Someone suggested that work points should also be recorded for attending meetings, but Liu Yufeng believes that as long as she can do something beneficial for the people, it is the greatest pleasure. She can use less since her income is small, so she resolutely did not accept this good intention. Liu Yufeng's service attitude is entirely about consciously working for the welfare of the entire society, rather than haggling over personal treatment and remuneration. Isn't this a noble communist work attitude?

Why do Liu Yufeng and so many service workers have this high degree of communist style? Because they have deeply understood the importance of social service work under the education of the Party, and they understand that they can contribute to the cause of socialist construction and do their part to realize the beautiful ideal in any work post. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Liu Yufeng's husband asked her to participate in production like many housewives. Going to the factory was certainly a great thing, but Liu Yufeng saw that the neighborhood also needed people to run collective welfare undertakings, and she couldn't leave it alone, so she didn't go to the factory. Cherishing the grand ambition of seeking welfare for the masses, she worked diligently and made outstanding contributions in the collective welfare undertaking post, and won the glorious title of National "March 8th Red Banner Bearer".

Comrade Mao Zedong had already told us in the editor's note to the article "Mobilizing Women to Join Production Solved the Difficulty of Insufficient Labor Force": "Chinese women are a great human resource. This resource must be tapped and struggled for the construction of a great socialist country." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") Comrade Liu Yufeng is a remarkable developer of human resources. The public canteens, nurseries, and service stations in cities and people's communes are liberating Chinese women for the second time. Thousands upon thousands of women are stepping onto the production front without any worries, and are investing in the great cause of socialist construction. Service workers, cooks, and nursery workers with a communist style, who are completely trustworthy like Liu Yufeng, are emerging in large numbers every moment, from every place, and every corner! They become everyone's heads of household, accepting the large bunches of keys handed over by the masses filled with trust and gratitude.

    把钥匙交给她
    刘丰
    上海女工李英娣看到家庭服务站服务员刘玉凤，样样事情都做得认真、细致、周到，就把刘玉凤当成自己家里人一样，把房屋钥匙也交给了刘玉凤。交钥匙的时候，李英娣郑重地对刘玉凤说：
    “你是党派来的当家人，毛主席、共产党真关心我们，我一定把生产搞好。”
    这几句话说得如此真诚、恳切，充满了无限的感激和信任。交钥匙，看来是一件小事；然而这件小事却反映出了新时代人与人之间关系的巨大变化。互相关怀，互相帮助，互相信任，这是社会主义大家庭中人们之间的新型关系，也是我们这个全新的时代的特征。目前，在许多城市组织人民经济生活的浪潮中，像刘玉凤同志这样受到人们的信任的服务员，真是成千上万，数不胜数。
    人们这样信任服务员，委以管家的全权，是有充分的理由的。这是因为服务员是具有高尚的共产主义风格的完全可以信赖的新型人物。请看刘玉凤：当国棉二十一厂女工乔秀兰患关节炎在家休养时，刘玉凤就到她家上门服务。早上替她送小孩上学，还替她买菜、挑水、倒马桶、看到脏衣服拿去就洗。像这种看到啥就做啥，完全不讲条件，不顾个人得失的忘我的工作态度，不正是高度的共产主义思想觉悟的具体表现么？刘玉凤每天早上要洗刷三十二只马桶，送一批孩子们上学，到十三家上门服务，一有空还帮洗衣组洗衣、上袜底、做鞋子。她做的工作虽多，可是因为常常开会，不记工分，所以她的工资比别的服务员少三分之一到一半。有人建议开会也记工分，可是刘玉凤认为：只要能为人民做些有益的事情，就是最大的愉快，自己收入少，可以用得省些，所以她坚决没有接受这个好意。刘玉凤的服务态度，完全是为了整个社会福利事业进行自觉的劳动，而不是斤斤计较个人的待遇报酬。这不正是高尚的共产主义的劳动态度么？
    为什么刘玉凤和许许多多的服务员具有这种高度的共产主义风格呢？因为她们在党的教育下深深地了解到社会服务工作的重要性，了解到在任何工作岗位上都可以为社会主义建设事业做出贡献，都可以为实现美好的理想尽一分力量。1958年大跃进的时候，刘玉凤的丈夫曾要求她跟很多家庭妇女一样去参加生产。到工厂去当然是件大好事，但是刘玉凤看到里弄办集体福利事业也需要人，她不能丢下不管，她就没有去工厂。她抱着为群众谋福利的宏愿，勤勤恳恳地工作，在集体福利事业的岗位上作出了出色的贡献，荣膺了全国“三八红旗手”的光荣称号。
    毛泽东同志在“发动妇女投入生产，解决了劳动力不足的困难”一文的按语中，早就告诉我们：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”）刘玉凤同志正是一个了不起的人力资源的发掘者。城市和人民公社的公共食堂、托儿所和服务站，正使我国妇女获得了第二次的解放。千千万万的妇女正在无牵无挂地纷纷走上了生产战线，投入伟大的社会主义建设事业。像刘玉凤这样具有共产主义风格完全可以信赖的服务员、炊事员、保育员正在每时每刻，从每个地方，每个角落，大批地涌现出来！她们成为大家的当家人，收下群众充满了信任和感激心情交来的大把大把的钥匙。
