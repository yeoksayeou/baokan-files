    US Dumps Tobacco, Wood Products, and Rags
    Causing Huge Trade Deficit in South Vietnam
    In South Vietnam, according to statistics published by Saigon's "Economic Bulletin" in January of this year, American economic aggression has caused a huge trade deficit in South Vietnam. In the first ten months of 1959, South Vietnam's imports were more than three times its exports. Exports amounted to 1.8 billion (South Vietnamese currency), while imports reached more than 6 billion.
    During this period, the United States and Japan ranked first and second respectively in South Vietnam's imports, while France was squeezed into third place, and West Germany was fourth. While thousands of tons of South Vietnamese tobacco are suffering from a lack of sales and 60% of the ceramics industry has been forced to shut down, the total amount of tobacco imported by the United States into South Vietnam increased by 16.6 million yuan compared to the same period last year, and the import volume of ceramic products increased by 365 tons.
    Four hundred sawmills and five hundred woodworking factories in South Vietnam have been forced to shut down, but the United States has imported large amounts of wood and wooden furniture into South Vietnam. Even more ridiculous is that the imports even included 20 million yuan worth of old clothes and rags.

    美国倾销烟叶木器破布
    造成南越大量贸易入超
    在南越，据西贡“经济公报”今年1月发表的统计数字表明，美国经济侵略造成了南越巨额入超。在1959年头十个月中，南越进口达出口额的三倍多。出口额是十八亿元。（南越币），而进口额却达到六十多亿元。
    这一期间，南越进口的中外货，美国和日本分别占第一和第二位，法国被排挤到第三位，第四位是西德。正当南越成千吨的烟叶苦于没有销路、陶瓷业十分之六被迫停产的时候，美国向南越输入的烟叶总额却比前年同期增加一千六百六十万元，陶瓷制品进口量增加了三百六十五吨。
    南越四百家锯木厂和五百家木器厂已被迫停产，但是美国却向南越输入了大量的木料和木器家具。更可笑的是，进口货中居然还有价值二千万元的旧衣和破布。
