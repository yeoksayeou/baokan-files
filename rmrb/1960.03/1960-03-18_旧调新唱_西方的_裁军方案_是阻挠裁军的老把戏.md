    Singing the Old Tune
    The West's "Disarmament Plan" is an Old Trick to Obstruct Disarmament
    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: A reporter from this agency reports: The Western "disarmament" plan, announced by the U.S. State Department on the 14th and formally presented by the British representative at the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting yesterday, would be more aptly named a "non-disarmament" plan.
    This plan begins by stating its aim to achieve "universal disarmament," but its spirit and specific provisions are thoroughly permeated with the old trick of Western countries for the past fifteen years to obstruct the resolution of disarmament issues—using supervision to replace disarmament, attempting to create a situation of supervision without disarmament, so that Western countries can freely engage in arms expansion and war preparations.
    The Western "disarmament" plan stipulates that universal disarmament be "achieved" through three stages. The plan emphasizes that the first thing to do in the first stage is to "gradually establish an international disarmament organization" responsible for "supervising and approving all disarmament measures." The tasks of this organization in this stage will be to "collect information on (countries') existing troop numbers (active duty troop numbers) and the military equipment of the land, sea, and air forces of various countries," obtain reports from countries regarding their "proposed plans for launching space devices" and their military expenditures, and so on. During this period, the maximum limit for the armies of the Soviet Union and the United States is 2.5 million each, and the troop levels of other countries are not specifically stipulated but are "to be agreed upon."
    The Western plan also stipulates that many issues should be "jointly studied" in this first stage. These issues include: so-called measures to ensure compliance with agreements on not placing weapons of mass destruction in orbit or in outer space, agreements on advance notification of missile launches and publication of missile launch sites and manufacturing locations, and agreements on not continuing to produce fissile materials for weapons; adopting some so-called "safeguards against surprise attack" measures, such as aerial and ground inspections, and so on. Obviously, these are all issues related to the problem of "supervision."
    Thus, in the first stage of the three stages for implementing universal disarmament as stipulated in the Western plan, not a trace of actual disarmament can be found. Besides "supervision," there is only "supervision." And the "international disarmament organization" that presides over these "supervision" measures is, in fact, a military intelligence gathering agency. Given the Western countries' eagerness to collect military intelligence from socialist countries, especially information about the Soviet Union's exploration of outer space and missiles, it is hard not to conclude that the Western countries have ulterior motives in making such provisions. As for stipulating a maximum limit on armed forces, everyone knows that the current number of U.S. armed forces is around 2.5 million, so this provision is meaningless.
    The Western plan stipulates that the second stage will only be entered "after the research work on those issues to be jointly studied" in the first stage "has been successfully completed." In the second stage, the main items stipulated in the Western plan are: implementing the "supervision" measures that were "jointly studied" in the first stage, setting a limit of 2.1 million troops for the Soviet Union and the United States, and "commencing the establishment of international organizations to maintain world peace," and so on.
    According to the Western plan, the "ultimate goal" of the third stage is supposedly to "gradually reduce the armed forces and armaments of all countries to the level needed to maintain domestic security and fulfill obligations undertaken under the United Nations Charter." The plan simply mentions the measures to achieve this goal: prohibiting the production of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, further reducing the stockpiles of these weapons, supervising missile stockpiles and finally destroying missiles, reducing troops, etc. However, the plan emphasizes that these measures should be implemented in "stages." In this stage, it is also stipulated that the work of "completing the establishment of international organizations and arrangements for maintaining world peace" should be "completed."
    The Western plan completely fails to specify the duration of each stage, or even the time limit for implementing certain specific measures. As a result, the first and second stages (stages that stipulate no disarmament but require "joint research" and gradual implementation of a large number of complex supervision measures) are bound to be endlessly long, and actual disarmament measures will be pushed to the distant future, while Western countries will be able to legally engage in large-scale arms expansion and war preparations without any restrictions. It is worth noting that this provision in the Western plan is fully in line with the current plans of the United States and other Western countries to buy time to develop missiles and other military capabilities.
    The Western plan deliberately avoids mentioning disarmament measures that are currently ripe and fully capable of being resolved. In this plan, which spans thousands of words, one cannot find a single sentence mentioning the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The plan also does not mention the abolition of military bases abroad or the reduction of troops stationed abroad.
    U.S. Secretary of State Herter recently openly dismissed disarmament measures such as banning nuclear weapons and abolishing military bases abroad as "empty slogans," indicating that the United States has absolutely no intention of accepting them.
    The Western plan does not elaborate on the "establishment of international organizations and arrangements to maintain world peace" that it emphasizes. However, U.S. Representative Eaton made it clear when peddling the Western plan at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting on the 15th that the United States was referring to "establishing an international force within the framework of the United Nations" in this regard. And everyone knows that the United States is currently consistently trying to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by establishing and controlling "international police forces" under the banner of the United Nations.

### 旧调新唱  西方的“裁军方案”是阻挠裁军的老把戏

    旧调新唱
    西方的“裁军方案”是阻挠裁军的老把戏
    新华社17日讯　本社记者报道：美国国务院14日公布的而由英国代表昨天在日内瓦十国裁军委员会会议上正式提出的西方“裁军”方案，如果定名为“不裁军”方案，倒是名副其实的。
    这个方案一开头说什么要争取实现“普遍裁军”，但是这个方案的精神和其中的具体规定却彻头彻尾地贯穿着西方国家十五年来阻挠解决裁军问题的老把戏——用监督来代替裁军，企图造成有监督而无裁军的局面，以便西方国家放手进行扩军备战。
    西方这个“裁军”方案规定，普遍裁军通过三个阶段来“实现”。方案强调在第一阶段首先要做的事是“逐步建立一个国际裁军组织”，负责“一切裁军措施的监督和批准”事宜。这个组织在这一阶段要做的事情将是“搜集有关（各国）现有军队人数（现役军队人数）和各国陆海空军军备的情报”，取得各国关于它们“拟议中的发射空间装置的计划”以及它们的军费开支情况等等的报告。在这期间苏美两国军队的最高限额各为二百五十万人，其他国家军队水平没有具体规定，而有待“商定”。
    西方的方案还规定在这个第一阶段中要“共同研究”许多问题，这些问题包括：所谓采取措施来确保关于不把大规模毁灭性武器置于轨道或置于外层空间的协议、关于事先就发射导弹作出通知和公布导弹发射场和制造地点的协议、和关于不继续制造裂变物质用于武器方面的协议得到遵守，采取一些所谓“保障免遭突袭”的措施，如空中和地面的视察等等。很明显，这些全是同“监督”问题有关的问题。
    这样，在西方方案规定的实施普遍裁军的三个阶段的第一阶段中，就找不到一丝一毫的实际着手裁军的影子，除了“监督”还是“监督”。而主持这些“监督”措施的
  “国际裁军组织”实际上是一个收集军事情报机关。鉴于西方国家热中于收集社会主义国家军事情报，特别是苏联在探索外层空间和导弹方面的情报，很难不令人得出结论，西方国家作出这种规定是别有用心的。至于规定武装部队最多限额，大家知道，目前美国武装部队的数量就是二百五十万人左右，因此这一规定是没有意义的。
    西方方案规定，只有在第一阶段那些要共同研究的问题的研究工作“顺利完成以后”才进入第二阶段。而在第二阶段中，西方方案规定的主要项目是：把第一阶段那些“共同研究”了的“监督”措施付诸实施，并为苏美两国确定军队为二百一十万的限额，“着手建立保持世界和平的国际组织”等等。
    根据西方方案，第三阶段的“最终目标”据说是“把各国武装部队和军备逐步裁减到维持国内安全和履行根据联合国宪章所承担的义务所需要的水平”。方案简单地提到达到这一目标的措施：禁止生产核武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器、进一步把这些武器的储存裁减，监督导弹储存并最后销毁导弹，裁减军队等。但是方案强调这些措施要“分阶段”实行。在这一阶段，还规定要“完成建立维护世界和平的国际组织和安排的工作”。
    西方方案完全没有规定每一阶段的期限，甚至没有规定实施某些具体措施的期限。这样一来，第一、二两个阶段（规定不裁军却要对大量繁杂的监督措施进行“共同研究”和逐渐付诸实施的阶段）就必然是漫长得无边无际的，实际裁军的措施将被推到遥远的将来，而西方国家将可以合法地毫无拘束地大事扩军备战。值得指出的是，西方方案这种规定同美国和其他西方国家目前争取时间发展导弹和其他军事实力的打算是完全符合的。
    西方方案对于当前已经成熟、完全有条件解决的裁军措施故意避而不谈。在这个长达数千言的方案中，人们完全看不到任何一句谈到要停止核武器试验的话。方案也只字不提取消在国外的军事基地以及裁减在国外的驻军问题。
    美国国务卿赫脱不久前就公然把禁止核武器和撤销各国在国外的军事基地等裁军措施说成是“空洞口号”，表示美国绝对无意接受。
    西方的方案对于它所强调的要“建立维护世界和平的国际组织和安排”，没有详细加以说明。但是美国代表伊顿15日在十国裁军委员会会议上兜售西方的方案时已经明白表示，在这方面美国指的是要在“联合国的范围内建立一支国际部队”。而大家知道，美国目前一贯竭力企图通过挂着联合国招牌的“国际警察部队”建立和对它的控制来干涉其他国家内政。
