	The Heroic Struggle of Latin American Women
	Women in Latin American countries are engaged in a heroic struggle for peace, national independence, and women's rights. Women in these countries are increasingly realizing that imperialist aggression and plunder are the root causes of their profound suffering. The heroic women of Latin America have a long tradition of struggle against colonialism and for freedom and independence. In recent years, Latin American women have more actively participated in the struggle against imperialism and dictatorial rule, demanding the defense of national resources and the improvement of working and living conditions.
	The victory of the Cuban Revolution at the beginning of last year opened a new chapter for the Latin American people's struggle against imperialism and dictatorship. In this revolution, Cuban women demonstrated heroic fighting spirit. From the very first day of the struggle against the Batista reactionary dictatorship, women made significant contributions. In the rebel army, amidst the flames of war, they took on the tasks of propaganda, transportation, and liaison. Many women took up arms and directly participated in the fighting. Women in the mountains, under the threat of enemy air raids, bravely continued their nursing, communications, broadcasting, and other work. They also established schools to improve the cultural level of the peasants and participated in the peasants' struggle for land. After the victory of the Cuban Revolution, U.S. imperialism repeatedly plotted to subvert the new Cuba from both outside and inside. Cuban women, together with the people of the whole country, rose up to participate in the struggle to defend the fruits of the revolution and defend the republic. Recently, U.S. imperialism has desperately torn off the mask of "mutual respect" and "non-interference," and openly sent planes to bomb Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields time and time again. Cuban women were filled with righteous indignation and resolutely rose up to help harvest sugarcane, preventing it from being destroyed by the enemy. They also actively participated in the militia and military training.
	Women in Latin American countries felt boundless anger towards the United States' interference in Cuba and its suppression of national democratic movements. In their struggle, they increasingly demanded strengthened unity and mutual support in order to further carry out the anti-imperialist struggle. In November 1959, an unprecedentedly large-scale women's conference in Latin American history was held in Santiago, the capital of Chile. Two hundred delegates from fifteen Latin American countries attended the conference. The convening of this conference was a major event in the struggle of Latin American women. Based on the actual conditions in Latin America, the conference decided on the tasks for future struggle: to fight against imperialism, to recover and defend national wealth, to implement land reform, to expose military treaties, and to abolish military bases.

    拉丁美洲妇女的英勇斗争
    拉丁美洲各国妇女为争取和平、民族独立和妇女权利而进行着英勇的斗争。这些国家的妇女日益深刻地体验到：帝国主义的侵略和掠夺，是妇女遭受深重苦难的根源。英勇的拉丁美洲妇女具有长期的反对殖民主义、要求自由独立的斗争传统。近几年来，拉丁美洲妇女更积极地投入了反帝、反独裁统治、要求保卫民族资源、要求改善劳动和生活条件的战斗。
    去年年初，古巴革命的胜利为拉丁美洲人民反帝、反独裁的斗争打开了新的局面。在这次革命中，古巴妇女表现出了英勇的战斗姿态。从打击巴蒂斯塔反动独裁政权的第一天起，妇女们就作出了不少的贡献。她们在起义军中，在战火纷飞之下，担任宣传、运输、联络的任务。好些妇女拿起了武器，直接参加了战斗。山区里的妇女们，在敌人空袭的威胁下，仍旧勇敢地进行着自己的护理、通讯、广播等等工作，她们还开办了学校，提高农民文化水平，并参加了农民争取土地的斗争。在古巴革命胜利后，美帝国主义一再阴谋从外部和内部对新生的古巴进行颠覆，古巴妇女和全国人民一道起来参加了保卫革命果实和保卫共和国的斗争。最近美帝国主义穷凶恶极地撕破了“互相尊重”、“不干涉”的假面具，公然派飞机一次又一次地轰炸古巴的糖厂和甘蔗园。古巴妇女义愤填膺，毅然起来帮助抢收甘蔗，免遭敌人破坏。她们还积极参加了民兵及军事训练。
    拉丁美洲各国妇女对于美国干涉古巴、镇压民族民主运动的行为感到无比的愤怒。她们在斗争中越来越要求加强团结和互相支援，以便进一步开展反帝斗争。1959年11月在智利首都圣地亚哥召开了拉丁美洲历史上空前大规模的妇女代表大会。参加大会的有拉丁美洲十五个国家的二百名代表。这次大会的召开是拉丁美洲妇女斗争中的一件大事。大会根据拉丁美洲的实际情况，决定了今后斗争的任务：为反对帝国主义、收回和保卫国家财富，为实行土地改革、揭露军事条约、撤销军事基地而斗争。
