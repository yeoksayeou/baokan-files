Habits and Changing Habits

    After discovering that new equipment was not being fully utilized during technical innovation, the Shenyang Shirt Factory conducted an investigation and research. The investigation revealed an important reason: some workers were unwilling to use the new equipment because they felt it was not easy to handle.

    Not easy to handle means unfamiliar, unaccustomed. People have developed certain production habits from long-term use of a particular tool. These habits are not necessarily a bad thing for production. However, current production conditions are changing rapidly. Today's manual operation may become semi-mechanized or mechanized tomorrow, and automated in the near future.

    As production conditions change, the tools used become more advanced and complex. In that case, our habits must be changed to adapt to the needs of the new situation. In fact, many workers are doing this and doing it very well. However, in real life, the issue of changing habits is not that simple.

    Habits are formed over many years, and changing them requires revolutionary zeal. First, we must have the conviction in our minds: in our era, many tall, sophisticated machines and equipment have been transformed. Is there any reason why a person's habits cannot be changed? More importantly, we must recognize that changing old habits is of great benefit to the development of production. Second, we must strengthen technical education. When workers learn new technologies, they can quickly master new equipment, and old habits will be easier to change.

    习惯和改变习惯
    沈阳衬衣厂在技术革新中发现新设备没有完全使用起来以后，就进行了调查研究。调查的结果有个重要的原因，就是有些工人对新设备感到不顺手便不愿意使用。
    不顺手，就是不习惯。过去长期使用着一种工具，人们就养成了一定的生产习惯。这种习惯，对于生产来说并不是坏事。可是，目前生产条件正发生着迅速的变化，今天的手工操作，明天可能是半机械化、机械化，再过一个时期，可能是自动化。
    生产条件变化了，使用的工具更高级更复杂了。那末，我们的习惯就得改，改得适应新情况的需要。事实，有许多工人是这样做的，而且做得很好。但是，在实际生活当中，改变习惯的问题，并不那么简单。
    习惯是多年养成的，要改变它，也要有一股革命干劲。首先在思想上要有这样的信念：在我们的时代，许多高大精密的机器设备，都把它改造了，一个人的习惯，有什么改不了的呢？更重要的是，要认识到，改变了旧习惯，对发展生产有着很大的好处。其次，是要加强技术教育。职工们学会了新技术，就能迅速掌握新设备，旧习惯也就容易改变了。
