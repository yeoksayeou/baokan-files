Far and Near
Black Dragon River, Harbin First Tool Factory Worker, Bǐng Dìyuán

"Die from stuffing when there's food, starve when there's none." This refers to people who don't know how to manage their lives. But in production, things like this often happen.

For example: During the high-yield campaign month, some people, in order to complete the daily or monthly leap forward plan, clearly could process products that fully meet quality standards using small materials. However, for the sake of immediate speed, they considered small materials troublesome and used batches of large materials without any consideration. When large materials were needed for production later on, they had already been used up, and going back to using small materials, some were indeed unusable. What to do? They would either request the higher-ups to allocate materials that could have been saved for later use, or stop work and wait for materials. This not only affected the failure to implement the leap forward targets of the unit, but also affected the leap forward of other units.

The reason why some comrades do this is because they suffer from nearsightedness. Their gaze only reaches three inches from themselves, and cannot reach further, unable to correctly combine the relationship between far and near.

In the Great Leap Forward, how should we understand and treat the relationship between far and near? Here, we cannot deviate from the viewpoint of dialectical materialism: the relationship between far and near, between long-term leap forward and immediate leap forward, is contradictory and opposing, but also unified and inseparable. The current leap forward plan is an inseparable part of the long-term leap forward plan. To complete the long-term plan, we must start from completing the current plan. Without the implementation of the current leap forward plan, the long-term leap forward will become empty talk. Therefore, we do everything from near to far, and cannot abandon the near for the far, and cannot suffer from farsightedness. However, on the other hand, our completion of the current leap forward plan is also for the realization of a greater leap forward in the future. Every step forward we take now should prepare for further progress. We must never only care about immediate interests and disregard long-term interests. We must not only look at today and not tomorrow, and we cannot suffer from nearsightedness. The problem is very clear: whether it is nearsightedness or farsightedness, it is one-sided and harmful.

If we all correctly recognize the relationship between far and near, and correctly recognize the relationship between completing the long-term leap forward plan and the current leap forward plan, we will better overcome the difficulties in the leap forward and promote our socialist cause to continue to leap forward.

    远和近
    黑龙江哈尔滨第一工具厂工人　邴第元
   “有饭撑死，没饭饿死”。这是指人不会过日子。可是在生产中，往往也有这样的事。
    例如：在高产运动月中，有些人为了完成当日或当月的跃进计划，明明用小料就可以加工出完全合乎质量标准的产品，然而，为了眼前的快，嫌小料费事，就把成批的大型材料毫不可惜地使用了。当以后生产正需要大型材料时，大料却已经用完，再去搬用小料，有的又确实使用不上。怎么办呢？不是请求上级拨给本来可以留待以后再用的材料，就是停工待料。这样，不但影响本单位的跃进指标不能落实，而且还影响其他单位的跃进。
    有的同志之所以这样做，是由于患了近视。目光只射到离自己三寸的地方，而不能射得更远，不能把远和近的关系正确地结合起来。
    在大跃进中，应当怎样来认识和对待远和近的关系呢？在这里，也不能离开辩证唯物主义的观点：远和近之间，长远跃进和眼前跃进之间是矛盾对立的，又是统一而不可分割的。当前的跃进计划是长远跃进计划的不可分割的部分。要完成长远的计划，必须从完成当前的计划做起，没有当前跃进计划的落实，长远的跃进就会成为空谈。所以我们做任何事情都是由近及远，不能舍近求远，不能患远视。但是，另一方面，我们完成当前的跃进计划又是为了今后实现更大的跃进，我们当前的每一步前进，都应该给进一步的前进作准备，绝不能只顾眼前利益，不顾长远的利益，不能只看今天，不看明天，不能患近视。问题很明白，无论近视或远视，都是片面的，都是有害的。
    如果我们大家都正确地认识到远和近的关系，正确地认识到完成长远的跃进计划和当前的跃进计划的关系，我们就会更好地克服跃进中的困难，推动我们的社会主义事业不断地向前飞跃。
