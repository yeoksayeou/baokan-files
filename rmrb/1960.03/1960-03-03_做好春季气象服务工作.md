    Do a Good Job in Spring Meteorological Services

    As the climate warms and the earth revives, a vigorous upsurge in spring plowing, spring sowing, and spring field management production has gradually unfolded from south to north. Meteorological work is the vanguard of agricultural production and must be ahead of production, fully committed to doing a good job in spring meteorological services.

    Seizing favorable weather conditions, expanding planting areas, planting well, and planting at the right time can ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural production. The key lies in whether the temperature and humidity conditions are suitable for sowing and whether the seedlings will be suddenly attacked by cold waves and low temperatures during emergence. Suitable temperature and humidity conditions will lead to early germination and complete emergence; avoiding sudden attacks by cold waves and low temperatures will prevent seed spoilage and seedling rot. According to meteorological forecasts, the average temperature in most areas in March this year will be slightly higher than normal, but the frost season will end slightly later than in previous years. Moreover, varying degrees of drought have already occurred in the Yellow River basin and most parts of southwestern China. Therefore, in spring agricultural production, it is necessary to fully utilize the role of meteorological work in seizing the favorable timing and rushing to spring plowing and spring sowing to compete with the weather for time.

    How can we fully utilize the role of meteorological work and do a good job in spring meteorological services?

    First, we must strengthen leadership and close cooperation. Meteorological departments in various regions should, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, cooperate closely with agricultural departments, using methods such as small-scale symposiums to jointly study the suitable sowing period for local spring crops, and identify the suitable sowing period in order to guide the masses to sow at the right time. This year, the Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Department, based on the fact that early rice in the central and southern regions is often harmed by rainstorms, and the flowering period of early rice in the northern region is often harmed by cold dew wind, and in conjunction with relevant departments, conducted a more comprehensive study from various aspects such as plant physiology, cultivation, seeds, plant protection, and agricultural meteorology, and put forward opinions on the suitable sowing period for early rice. This approach is very good and deserves to be promoted.

    Second, we must vigorously mobilize the masses and give full play to the role of the vast number of meteorological service stations, meteorological service posts, especially the people's commune meteorological service outposts and production brigade meteorological service groups. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and the weather and climate changes are extremely complex, while the impact of climatic conditions on crops varies. Under these complex circumstances, to identify the suitable sowing period for various local crops, especially the main crops, to achieve timely early sowing, to protect crops from frost damage, and to ensure that continuous crops have sufficient growing periods, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, carry out mass prediction and forecasting work, and combine local and current meteorological conditions, agricultural conditions, and mass experience well. After joint discussion and research by professional departments and the broad masses, we can adapt our work to the time, place, and circumstances, and build our work on a solid and reliable foundation.

    At present, meteorological departments in various regions should further strengthen the forecasting of suitable sowing periods for various local crops, especially the main crops, strengthen mass soil moisture surveys and soil moisture measurement and reporting work, in order to take measures to prevent spring drought, seize the opportunity, sow in a timely manner, and fully ensure the completion of spring sowing tasks. In addition, meteorological departments at all levels should also particularly strengthen the prediction and forecasting of disastrous weather such as cold waves, strong winds, and frost during the spring sowing period, in order to strengthen the field management of overwintering crops, guide the masses to take timely protective measures, and strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops.

### 做好春季气象服务工作

    做好春季气象服务工作
    气候转暖，大地回春，一个轰轰烈烈的春耕、春播和春季田间管理生产运动高潮，已经从南到北逐步展开。气象工作是农业生产的尖兵，必须走在生产的前面，全力做好春季气象服务工作。
    抓住有利的天时，扩大播种面积，种得好，种得适时，就能保证农业生产的大丰收，关键在于播种时的温度、湿度条件是否适宜，出苗时是否会受到寒潮和低温的突然袭击。温度、湿度条件适宜，就会及早发芽，出苗齐全；而躲过寒潮和低温的突然袭击，就会避免坏种和烂秧。根据气象预测估计，今年大部地区3月份平均气温将较常年稍高，但霜冻又比往年结束略晚，而黄河流域和西南大部分地区已发生不同程度的旱象。因此，在春季农业生产中，如何与天争时，掌握住有利时机，突击春耕、春播，就需要充分发挥气象工作的作用。
    怎样充分发挥气象工作的作用，做好春季气象服务呢？
    首先，必须加强领导，密切协作。各地气象部门，要在各级党委统一领导下，与农业部门密切协作，通过小型座谈会等方式，共同研究当地春耕作物适宜播种期问题，找出当地适宜的播种期，以便指导群众适时播种。今年广东省气象部门，根据中部、南部地区早稻常受暴风雨为害，北部地区早稻开花期常受寒露风为害等情况，和有关部门一起，从植物生理、栽培、种子、植保、农业气象等各个方面，进行了比较全面的研究，提出了适宜的早稻播种期的意见，这种做法很好，值得提倡。
    其次，要大力发动群众，充分发挥广大气象服务台、气象服务站，特别是人民公社气象服务哨和生产大队气象服务小组的作用。我国幅员广大，物产丰富，天气、气候变化极为复杂，而农作物受气候条件的影响又各不相同。在这种错综复杂的情况下，要找出当地各种农作物特别是主要作物的适宜播种期，做到适时早播，使作物不受冻害，并保证连作的作物有足够的生长期。这就必须充分发动群众，开展群众性的预测预报工作，把当地、当时的气象条件、农业条件和群众经验很好地结合起来，经过专业部门和广大群众共同讨论、研究，就能作到因时、因地、因事制宜，把工作建立在切实可靠的基础之上。
    目前，各地气象部门要进一步加强当地各种农作物特别是主要农作物适宜播种期的预报工作，加强群众性的查墒和土壤水分测报工作，以便采取措施，防止春旱，掌握时机，适时下种，全力保证春播任务的完成。此外，各级气象部门还应特别加强春播期间寒潮、大风、霜冻等灾害性天气预测预报工作，以便加强越冬作物的田间管理，指导群众及时采取防护措施，力争夏季作物大丰收。
