Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 26th: Loading and unloading operations at major ports in Jiangsu Province have achieved an average of 70% mechanization and semi-mechanization.

According to preliminary statistics, in the past fifty days, Jiangsu Province's ports have manufactured more various transport machines than in the entire last year; the number of cranes and earthen docks added have reached 56% and 70% of the total added last year, respectively; ground rails, cableways, chutes, and various transport vehicles have also greatly increased. Employees of the Suzhou City Transportation Company recently formed ten mechanized and serialized loading and unloading operation transport "dragons" at a batch of docks. The Zhenjiang City Port Authority innovated 170 tools in one month; the city's transportation company also simultaneously realized 24 innovations.

Due to the increased level of mechanization in port loading and unloading operations, many encouraging new phenomena have emerged in production. More than 200 docks in ten cities and counties, including Wuxi, Nantong, and Suzhou, have realized serialized loading and unloading operations, which not only reduces labor intensity but also doubles loading and unloading efficiency. With the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency, the throughput of ports throughout the province has increased by more than 50% compared to before, and the non-productive time of ships arriving at ports has also relatively decreased.

The port technical innovation and technical revolution movement has broad mass participation. Not only do the loading and unloading workers actively participate, but office cadres and technicians are also highly motivated, saying "Go to work to produce, after work to innovate, production is the hero, innovation is the expert."

    江苏主要港口技术大改造
    70％装卸作业实现了机械化和半机械化
    据新华社南京26日电　江苏省各主要港口的装卸作业，平均已有70％实现了机械化和半机械化。
    据初步统计，最近五十天来，江苏省各港口制造的各种运输机，比去年全年制造的还多；添置的起重吊杆和土码头，也分别达到去年一年添置量的56％和70％；地轨、索道、溜槽、各种搬运车辆也都大大增加。苏州市运输公司的职工，最近在一批码头上组成了十一条机械化、系列化的装卸作业输送“龙”。镇江市港务局在一个月的时间内革新了一百七十件工具；这个市的运输公司也同时实现了二十四项革新。
    由于港口装卸作业机械化程度的提高，生产上已经出现了许多令人鼓舞的新气象。无锡、南通、苏州等十个市县已经有二百多个码头实现了装卸作业系列化，不仅减轻了劳动强度，而且使装卸效率成倍提高。装卸效率提高后，全省港口吞吐量比以前增加了50％以上，船舶到港非生产时间也相对地下降。
    港口技术革新和技术革命运动具有广泛的群众性，不仅装卸搬运工人积极地参加，科室干部、技术人员也都是“上班搞生产，下班闹革新，生产是英雄，革新是能手”，积极性很高。
