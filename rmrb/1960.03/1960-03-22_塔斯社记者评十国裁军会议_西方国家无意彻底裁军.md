Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 20th. TASS special correspondent Pavlov reports: The first week of work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference is coming to an end. In the first few meetings, the delegations have already shown differences on important issues. These meetings have also largely demonstrated the attitude with which the Western delegations came to Geneva.

Pavlov pointed out that, regardless of the world's need for comprehensive and complete disarmament, Western countries have not yet shown the seriousness they should have in solving this task. Western countries have not yet actually expressed their attitude towards the Soviet Union's plan for comprehensive and complete disarmament. So far, the Soviet plan remains the only practical and feasible plan received by the Disarmament Committee for solving the task of comprehensive and complete disarmament.

The Western countries' silent attitude towards the Soviet plan at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference clearly shows their attitude and purpose in coming to Geneva.

Pavlov pointed out that well-informed sources say that Western representatives are annoyed by the term "comprehensive and complete disarmament." However, Western representatives have not objected to this specific plan in principle, nor do they dare to openly oppose the proposition of comprehensive and complete disarmament, because doing so would show that their vote in favor of comprehensive and complete disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly was merely made under the pressure of world opinion.

Among the delegations participating in the Ten-Nation Committee, there is a growing view that the joint plan submitted to the committee by Western countries is just a hodgepodge of partial measures on disarmament, which does not even propose the task of comprehensive and complete disarmament.

Pavlov concluded by saying that it is said that the head of a certain Western delegation once said that Western countries will begin "actual work" next week. It is hoped that Western countries will fulfill their promise and begin detailed discussions on the Soviet Union's plan for comprehensive and complete disarmament.

    塔斯社记者评十国裁军会议
    西方国家无意彻底裁军
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦19日讯：塔斯社特派记者巴甫洛夫报道说，十国裁军会议第一周的工作即将结束。在头几次会议上，各国代表团已经在重要问题上表现出分歧。这几次会议在很大程度上也表明了西方的代表团是抱着什么态度到日内瓦来的。
    巴甫洛夫指出，西方国家不顾世界对全面彻底裁军的需要，目前还没有对解决这个任务表现出应有的认真态度。西方国家实际上还没有对苏联的全面彻底裁军计划表示自己的态度。到目前为止，苏联的计划仍然是裁军委员会所收到的为解决全面彻底裁军任务的唯一切实可行的计划。
    西方国家在十国裁军会议上对苏联的计划采取这种沉默的态度清楚地表明，他们是抱着什么态度和为了什么目的到日内瓦来的。
    巴甫洛夫指出，消息灵通人士说，西方代表对“全面彻底裁军”一词感到恼火。但是，西方代表在原则上没有对这个具体计划提出异议，他们也不敢公开反对全面彻底裁军的主张，因为这样做就会表明，他们在联合国大会上投票赞成全面彻底裁军只不过是在世界舆论的压力下作出的。
    在参加十国委员会的代表团中越来越广泛地流传着这样一种见解：西方国家提交给委员会的联合计划只是有关裁军的局部措施的大杂烩，它甚至没有提出全面彻底裁军的任务。
    巴甫洛夫最后说，据说西方某一代表团团长曾经说，西方国家在下星期将着手进行“实际工作”。人们希望西方国家将履行自己的诺言，开始详细讨论苏联关于全面彻底裁军的计划。
