    Drawing Water Over a Thousand Li to Irrigate the Hilly Areas of Huainan
    The Shi-Pi-Hang Irrigation Project is Being Speeded Up
    The Water Control Army is Vigorously Carrying Out Technical Innovation to Strive to Irrigate Five to Seven Million Mu of Farmland This Spring

    (Our dispatch) The second phase of the Shi-Pi-Hang Irrigation Project, which traverses central Anhui for a thousand li, has made tremendous achievements since construction began last winter. The majority of the work above the branch canals is nearing completion. Fifteen inlet gates and underground culvert projects have been completed, accounting for 75% of the plan, and both canal head projects have been completed. At present, the water control army here is advancing triumphantly, striving to use the water from this project to irrigate five to seven million mu of paddy fields this spring.
    The Shi-Pi-Hang Irrigation Project is one of the large-scale water conservancy projects in Anhui Province. It draws water from the Meishan, Foziling, Xianghongdian, Mozitan, and Longhekou reservoirs on the three major rivers in the Dabie Mountains—the Shi River, Pi River, and Hangbu River (with a total storage capacity of more than 6 billion cubic meters)—and sends it through artificially excavated canals to more than 12 million mu of farmland in the hilly areas of Huainan.
    The construction of this project is extremely arduous. More than 80% of the canals must pass through undulating hilly areas. Where they pass, mountains are opened and ridges are split, valleys are crossed and gullies are filled. There are 43 mountain ridges with a cutting depth of more than 10 meters. The largest Pinggang cutting ridge project is 2.5 kilometers long and 23 meters deep; there are 33 low-lying areas with a filling height of more than 10 meters, extending 38 kilometers. The largest Chewangji filling gully project in Shouxian County is more than 4 kilometers long, with a filling height of 17 meters, and the highest is 24 meters. There are more than 20,000 various water gates, underground culverts, aqueducts, and ship locks, which can build 587 hydroelectric stations, 129 pumping stations, and 154 medium and small-sized reverse regulating reservoirs.
    After the completion of the Shi-Pi-Hang Irrigation Project, the maximum water diversion flow can reach 525 cubic meters per second, which can irrigate more than 12 million mu of farmland in Jinzhai, Huoqiu, Liu'an, Shouxian, Shucheng, Lujiang, Feidong, Feixi, and the suburbs of Hefei City in the Liu'an area, and Dingyuan County in the Bengbu area. Moreover, 76% of the area can be irrigated by gravity flow. Canals above the branch canals can be navigated by ships ranging from 100 to 2,000 tons, connecting to the Yangtze River in the south and reaching the Huai River in the north. Canals and rivers crisscross within the irrigated area, allowing the passage of wooden boats. By utilizing the water level difference for power generation, the annual power generation can reach more than 140 million kilowatt-hours, and the water surface can also be used to vigorously develop aquaculture.
    The hilly area of Huainan is a drought-prone area. Before liberation, "a minor drought would occur if it didn't rain for five days, a major drought would occur if it didn't rain for ten days, seedlings would turn yellow if it didn't rain for half a month, and crops could be burned if it didn't rain for a month." Although a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects have been built after liberation, there has been no systematic management and no backbone projects, and agricultural production is still threatened by drought. In order to completely solve the drought problem in this area, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with the district and municipal committees of the Huainan area, conducted research and decided, based on the principle of relying mainly on the communes and supplementing with state support, to develop the Shi, Pi, and Hang three major rivers early, and divert sufficient water sources to irrigate the vast hilly areas. In the winter of 1958, a battle with nature was fully launched in the Huainan area. This project has already begun to partially exert its benefits last year. Under the unprecedented drought in decades, it released water to irrigate more than one million mu of farmland, ensuring a bumper harvest.
    After entering the second phase of construction last winter, despite the deeper and deeper mountains being cut, the higher and higher gullies being filled, and the more frequent rainy and snowy days, thanks to the soaring revolutionary drive and drilling spirit of the broad masses, they vigorously engaged in technical innovation, universally adopted the soil splitting method to loosen the soil, used chamber blasting when encountering rocks, and used a large amount of mechanical power and animal power to transport soil. Under the conditions of steep slopes and long roads, the average work efficiency has increased by about one time compared with the first phase of the project. Most of the equipment and funds required for this project are raised by the people's communes themselves, and the state only provides necessary assistance. Funds raised by the masses account for 70% of the total project funds.
    Now, under the encouragement of the slogan "Work hard this spring to completely complete the branch canals, dig more distributary canals and irrigate more land, and ensure a great agricultural harvest," the broad masses of workers have redoubled their efforts and launched a new upsurge in water control.

### 千里引水灌溉淮南丘陵地区  史淠杭灌溉工程加紧修建  治水大军大搞技术革新力争今春灌田五百万至七百万亩

    千里引水灌溉淮南丘陵地区
    史淠杭灌溉工程加紧修建
    治水大军大搞技术革新力争今春灌田五百万至七百万亩
    本报讯　横贯安徽中部，长达千里的史淠杭灌溉工程的第二期工程，从去冬开工以来，已经取得巨大的成绩。分干渠以上工程大部分已接近完成，进水闸、地下涵洞工程已完成的有十五座，占计划75％，两处渠首工程已经完工。目前，这里的治水大军高歌猛进，力争今年春灌中引用这个工程的水灌溉五百万到七百万亩水稻田。
    史淠杭灌溉工程是安徽省大型水利工程之一，它引用大别山区的三条大河流——史河、淠河、杭埠河上的梅山、佛子岭、响洪甸、磨子潭、龙河口五个水库的蓄水（总蓄水量六十多亿立方米），通过人工开挖的渠道，送到淮南丘陵地区的一千二百多万亩农田里。
    这项工程施工非常艰巨，80％以上的渠道要穿过丘陵起伏地区，所经之处开山劈岭，跨壑填冲，切深在十米以上的山岭就有四十三处，最大的平岗切岭工程，长二点五公里，切深二十三米；填高十米以上的洼冲有三十三处，长达三十八公里，最大的寿县车王集填冲工程，有四公里多长，填高十七米，最高的二十四米。各种水闸、地下涵洞、渡槽、船闸等大小建筑物共有两万多座，可以建造水电站五百八十七座，抽水机站一百二十九座，中小型反调节水库一百五十四座。
    史淠杭灌溉工程完成后，最大引水流量可达五百二十五秒公方，能灌溉六安专区的金寨、霍丘、六安、寿县、舒城、廬江，合肥市的肥东、肥西、郊区，蚌埠专区的定远等县市一千二百多万亩农田，而且76％的面积都可自流灌溉。分干渠以上的渠道，可行驶一百吨到二千吨的轮船，南通长江，北达淮河，灌区内河渠交错，可通行木船。利用水位落差发电，每年发电量可达一亿四千多万度，并可利用水面大量发展养殖事业。
    淮南丘陵地区是个易旱多灾的地区，解放前“五天不雨小旱，十天不雨大旱，半月不雨青苗黄，一月不雨禾可燎”。解放后虽然兴修了大量的小型水利工程，但没有进行系统的治理，没有骨干工程，农业生产仍受旱灾威胁。为了彻底解决这个地区的干旱问题，中共安徽省委同淮南地区的地、市委作了研究，在以社办为主，国家支持为辅的原则下，决定提早开发史淠杭三大河流，引用充足的水源，灌溉广大的丘陵地区。1958年冬，一场与大自然的决战就在淮南地区全面展开，这个工程去年就已开始部分地发挥效益，在数十年所未有的大旱下，放水灌溉了一百多万亩农田，保证了丰收。
    去年冬天进入第二期工程施工后，尽管山岭越切越深，沟壑越填越高，雨雪天较多，由于广大群众发挥了冲天的革命干劲和钻劲，大闹技术革新，普遍采用劈土法松土，遇着石头用洞室爆破，大量的使用了机械动力、畜力运土，在坡陡路长的情况下，平均工效比第一期工程提高一倍左右。这项工程所需器材、资金，大部分是由人民公社自筹解决，国家只给予必要的援助，群众自筹经费占工程总经费70％。
    现在，广大民工在“大干一春，彻底完成分干渠，多挖支渠多灌溉，保证农业大丰收”的口号鼓舞下，干劲倍增，掀起了新的治水高潮。
