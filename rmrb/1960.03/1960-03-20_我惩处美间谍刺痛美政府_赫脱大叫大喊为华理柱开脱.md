Xinhua News Agency, 19th, Washington Dispatch: The trial of American spy Walsh by Chinese judicial organs has exposed and struck at the US imperialist plot to subvert the Chinese people's democratic regime, greatly infuriating the US government.

US Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on the 18th, attempting to cover up Walsh's crimes, thereby exonerating US imperialism for directing Walsh to engage in espionage and subversive activities. Dulles shouted that Walsh was "an innocent American citizen" whose "sole mission was religious," and portrayed Walsh's orders to lie dormant in China after liberation under the guise of religion to engage in espionage as stemming from his "devotion to the spiritual welfare of his Catholic co-religionists." However, Dulles completely dared not touch upon the specific crimes, based on conclusive evidence and admitted by Walsh himself, for which the Chinese court sentenced this veteran American spy in his statement.

Dulles also claimed that the United States would make trouble about this in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. He said that he would instruct the US ambassador to Poland to raise the "strongest protest" at the next Sino-US ambassadorial meeting.

    我惩处美间谍刺痛美政府
    赫脱大叫大喊为华理柱开脱
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：中国司法机关对美国间谍分子华理柱的审判揭露和打击了美帝国主义颠覆中国人民民主政权的阴谋，美国政府因此大为恼火。
    美国国务卿赫脱18日发表一篇声明，企图掩盖华理柱的罪行，从而替指使华理柱从事间谍颠覆活动的美帝国主义开脱责任。赫脱叫喊什么华理柱是“一个无辜的美国公民”，“他的唯一使命是宗教性的”，并且把华理柱奉命在解放后潜伏中国以宗教外衣为掩护从事间谍活动说成是出于他“对他的天主教教友的精神福利的献身精神”。但是赫脱对于中国法庭判处这个老牌美国间谍所依据的证据确凿而且华理柱本人也已供认不讳的具体罪行，在他的声明中却完全不敢触及。
    赫脱还声言美国要在华沙中美大使级会谈中就此无理取闹。他说，他将指示美国驻波兰大使在下一次中美大使级会谈中提出“最强硬的抗议”。
