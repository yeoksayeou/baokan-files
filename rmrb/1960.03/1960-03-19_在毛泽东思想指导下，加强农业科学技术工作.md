    Strengthen Agricultural Science and Technology Work Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought
    Zhao Shouyi, Alternate Secretary of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee
    (I)
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have recently emphasized the task of strengthening the agricultural front and accelerating the realization of agricultural technological transformation. To accomplish this task, we must vigorously strengthen agricultural science and technology work under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Lenin主义 with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, is the only correct ideology to guide our country's revolution and construction. No work can be separated from this guiding ideology, and agricultural science and technology work is no exception. Some people think that "Mao Zedong Thought can only guide social science, but not natural science." This is completely wrong. Of course, the research object of natural science has no class nature, but the people who study and master natural science do have a class nature. The research of natural science cannot be free from the guidance of a certain worldview, and the application of natural science cannot be free from the guidance of certain principles and policies. Comrade Mao Zedong has a complete set of theories on the development path of science. For example, science serves production, theory is combined with practice, "let a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend," and so on. Only by following these theories of Comrade Mao Zedong can we adhere to the socialist and communist political direction and adhere to the correct line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in scientific and technological work. Comrade Mao Zedong also set a brilliant example in using dialectical materialism to summarize China's agricultural production experience and agricultural scientific research achievements. Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, and continuously developed the specific content of various production increase measures; recently, he also put forward the principle that agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry depend on each other and are indispensable. These principles have not only promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also creatively developed the theory of agricultural science. Therefore, agricultural science and technology work must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology.
    Like all parts of the country, Shaanxi Province's agricultural science and technology work has developed by adhering to the direction of scientific development pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, opposing the bourgeois tendencies of technology divorced from politics, theory divorced from practice, and experts divorced from the masses; it has developed under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's "walking on two legs" policy; and it has developed by carrying out experimental research around the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter." At present, 52 counties and cities and most people's communes in the province have established agricultural scientific research institutions. From the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi to the Guanzhong Plain, from the Qinling Mountains to both sides of the Han River, scientific and technological networks are crisscrossed; professional researchers and farmers are integrated into a common practice; more than one million farmers are engaged in various experimental studies around the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter"; and new achievements in scientific research and technological innovation are fruitful and emerge in endlessly. The rapid development of agricultural science and technology work has powerfully promoted the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. In 1958, Shaanxi Province's agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest; in 1959, although it suffered a hundred-day drought unseen in decades, the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations still increased by more than 12% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the past, we have achieved such great results under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought; in the future, we must more consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, more effectively strengthen agricultural science and technology work, and realize the task of agricultural technological transformation as soon as possible, so as to push our agricultural production and agricultural science to a new peak.
    (II)
    To strengthen agricultural science and technology work, we must adopt correct policies. In this regard, Comrade Mao Zedong has many valuable suggestions. Our deepest understanding is that the development of agricultural science and technology work must adopt a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies that combine popularization and improvement, combine learning modern science and carrying forward good traditions, and combine individual experiments and comprehensive research.
    Combining Popularization and Improvement
    "Combining popularization and improvement" and "giving equal importance to foreign methods and indigenous methods" are correct policies for developing science and technology, and are an important part of Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking on economic construction and also on scientific and technological work. The purpose of our agricultural science and technology work is to arm agriculture with the most advanced technology and to climb to the peak of world agricultural science at the fastest speed. On this issue, we must have lofty aspirations and ambitions, and we must never be content with mediocrity. Some people think that agriculture is very simple, just spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvesting, and winter storage, without profound knowledge, and only needs popularization but not improvement. This is a short-sighted view, and it is the view of lazy people and cowards. In fact, agriculture has to manage the sky, the land, and the crops, to master the changeable and varied weather conditions, and to study living animals and plants, which is by no means a simple matter. Especially now, to realize agricultural modernization, to apply advanced science and technology to such complex agricultural production, without a very high level of science and technology, it is obviously impossible. Therefore, we must vigorously grasp improvement and fiercely attack the cutting edge. To achieve this goal, there are two possible paths: one is to ignore popularization and improve in isolation, only grasping modern science and technology, and not grasping the simple and easy-to-use science and technology that directly serve current production; the other is to give equal importance to indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, to improve on the basis of popularization, and to popularize under the guidance of improvement. Facts have proved that the former is a path of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results, while the latter is a path of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The latter path has many benefits. First of all, it is easy to grasp from simple to complex, and can immediately solve a large number of problems existing in current production. For example, the Yan'an Yanhui Canal construction site has fully realized the土mechanicalization and earth excavation blasting, basically eliminating shoulder carrying and manual digging, with each person completing 23 cubic meters of earth per day, which is 5 to 6 times higher than the general work efficiency. In 1959, the province adopted the method of burying soil and cutting leaves, effectively controlling the spread of wheat stripe rust. Liu Xiuying, a pig-raising expert in 鄠County, created a method of artificially controlling male and female traits, which solved the problem of mass breeding of sows. These facts all show that indigenous methods can solve major problems.
    Secondly, from indigenous to foreign, and from indigenous methods comes foreign technology, which can train the workforce, accumulate experience, and lay a solid foundation for rapid improvement. For example, in the process of farm tool improvement and semi-mechanization, it is possible to better understand the different natural conditions, crop varieties, and cultivation methods in various farming areas, so that agricultural machinery can adapt to these characteristics; it can enable the masses of farmers to gradually master the ability to use agricultural machinery, and cultivate a group of skilled technology innovators from the masses, to train cadres and accumulate experience for the comprehensive realization of mechanization and electrification.
    Indigenous and foreign methods cannot be completely separated. Foreign technology is contained within indigenous methods, and greatness comes from the ordinary. The most advanced things often arise from simple and easy-to-use science and technology. For example, the Yulin Prefecture adopted the method of using water to draw sand and flushing sand to level the land, turning hundreds of thousands of acres of desert into fertile fields. The most prominent among them is the Guidebao Commune and the Huayuangou Production Team in Yulin County, which created a high-yield record of an average yield of 1,500 kilograms per mu of sandy land. Fan Yuqi and Xiong Deyou, farmers in Sanyuan County, used acupuncture to treat swine fever, with a cure rate of 80% to 90%. The masses said: "Don't be afraid of swine fever, just give a shot from Fan and Xiong." Using water to draw sand and acupuncture to treat swine fever are both indigenous methods, but they are also the most advanced technologies.
    In short, the development of everything has a process from low level to high level, and we must master this law. In the field of agricultural science and technology work, we must not only establish the ambition to climb to the world's peak, but also advance step by step in a down-to-earth manner; we must not only look at foreign technology, but also start with indigenous methods; we must not only attack the cutting edge fiercely, but also focus on the scientific and technological problems that directly serve current production; and we must combine the two well.
    Combining Learning Modern Agricultural Science and Carrying Forward Good Traditions
    The technical level of our country's agricultural production has both backward and advanced aspects. That is to say, the production tools are backward, mainly using hand tools and animal power tools; the farming methods are advanced, with good traditions of intensive cultivation that have gradually formed over thousands of years and have been fully developed since the Great Leap Forward. The level of our agricultural science also has both backward and advanced aspects. That is to say, the theory of agricultural science is not systematic enough; the experience of agricultural production is incomparably rich. We must fully estimate this situation of being both backward and advanced. On the one hand, we must firmly realize the technological transformation of agriculture; on the other hand, we must maintain and carry forward the good tradition of intensive cultivation. On the one hand, we must learn and study modern agricultural science; on the other hand, we must use modern agricultural science to summarize and improve the rich experience of agricultural production in our country. Combining these two aspects well can create agricultural science and technology achievements that are both modern and have Chinese characteristics, and climb to the peak of world agricultural science.
    Comrade Mao Zedong is best at cleverly combining modern agricultural science with the rich experience of agricultural production in our country. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase is a product of the combination of the two. Comrade Mao Zedong systematically, centrally, and vividly summarized the basic factors of agricultural production increase as soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and work, and creatively proposed principles and measures in line with the laws of natural development in each of the production increase factors. For example, in terms of soil, according to the principle that deep plowing can promote soil ripening and the experience popular among farmers that "deep plowing one inch of soil will produce one more dou of grain," the policy of improving soil centered on deep plowing was proposed. In terms of fertilizer, according to the tradition of using organic fertilizer in our country's agricultural production and the experience popular among farmers that "more pigs mean more fertilizer, and more fertilizer means more grain," the policy of taking pig raising as the center and implementing both organic and inorganic fertilizers was proposed. In terms of water conservancy, according to the law that water can be harmful and beneficial, the debate on the two water control lines of water storage and drainage in our country's history was summarized, and the policy of prioritizing water storage was proposed. Comrade Mao Zedong's creative contributions have not only guided and promoted the continuous leap forward in our country's agricultural production, but have also greatly enriched the content of agricultural science.
    We must learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's example, combine the realization of agricultural modernization with the carrying forward of the good traditions of agricultural production in our country, and combine the learning of modern agricultural science with the summarizing of the production experience of the masses of farmers; at present, we must pay special attention to solving the problem of mutual adaptation between agricultural mechanization and intensive cultivation. For example, in the cultivation process of agriculture in our country, the most active and meticulous work is field management, and the saying "three points for planting and seven points for management" is popular among farmers. In order to adapt to the needs of field management, agricultural mechanization should not only focus on large-scale machinery for plowing, planting, harvesting, and threshing, but also consider small-scale, precision machinery for field management. Furthermore, terraced fields, zone planting, intercropping, etc., are unique cultivation systems and methods in our country. How agricultural mechanization adapts to these characteristics must also be specifically studied and appropriate measures must be taken. In short, our agricultural mechanization must simultaneously meet the needs of increasing labor productivity and increasing yield per unit area. We must not be satisfied with the original cultivation technology and delay the progress of mechanization, nor can we only focus on realizing mechanization and abandon our country's inherent good traditions and rich experience.
    Combining Single-Item Experiment and Comprehensive Research
    Natural phenomena are interconnected and mutually restrictive. Starting from this basic viewpoint, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong elucidated the dialectical relationship that the manure of animals is the food of plants, plants are the food of animals, and animals are the food of human beings, thereby determining the agricultural production policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Starting from this basic viewpoint, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that in the "Eight-Character Charter," soil is the foundation, water, fertilizer, and seeds are the prerequisites, rational close planting is the center, and protection, management, and work are the basic guarantees, thereby determining the direction of comprehensive application of various production increase measures. The direction of comprehensive development and comprehensive application pointed out by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong has played a huge role in the development of agricultural production and agricultural science. Taking the example of our Shaanxi Province, the Xiaoma Production Team of the Puj Commune in Xingping County implemented the comprehensive development of agriculture and animal husbandry. In more than a year, the number of live pigs increased by 20 times, the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland increased by more than 2 times, and the wheat yield increased by nearly 2 times. The Bayi Production Team of the Wuguan Commune in Shangnan County implemented the method of mixed farming and forestry on mountain slopes, which increased the economic income per mu of land by more than 40%. In terms of the comprehensive application of production increase measures, the effect is also very significant. According to the survey, the Dujiapo Production Team of the Yangling People's Commune in Xingping County had obviously different results in wheat planting depending on whether the comprehensive measures were well coordinated. Plot No. 12, the amount of sowing increased by 43.75% compared with the previous year, the amount of fertilizer applied increased by 12%, the plowing depth increased by 2 inches, and the comprehensive measures were well coordinated. As a result, the yield increased by 28.9%, labor productivity increased by 3.4%, and production costs decreased by 4%. Plot No. 11, the amount of sowing increased by 37.5% compared with the previous year, but too little fertilizer was applied and the plowing depth was not enough. As a result, the yield decreased by 48.6%, labor productivity decreased by 48.9%, and production costs increased by 131.2%. Another example is the problem of alternate bearing of apples. In the past, people only looked for the cause from the variety of fruit trees and mistakenly believed that this was an unchangeable natural law. In recent years, the Shaanxi Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station has looked for the cause from all aspects of soil, cultivation, fertilization, and pest control, and has taken comprehensive measures to finally solve this important scientific problem, making apple production abundant year after year, and the yield has risen linearly. These facts show that comprehensive development and comprehensive application are a path of greater, faster, better, and more economical results for developing agricultural production. Of course, we cannot ignore single-item experiments. Only through single-item experiments to deeply understand the specific laws of various factors can we better conduct comprehensive research. Therefore, in agricultural science and technology work, we must combine the experiments of laboratories and experimental farms with the experience of large-area high-yield production, and combine single-item experiments with comprehensive research. Start from the requirements of comprehensive application to conduct single-item experiments, explore new ways to increase production, and conduct comprehensive research on the basis of single-item experiments to find the internal connections between various production increase measures and achieve the purpose of comprehensive application. In agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, we must also pay attention to comprehensive utilization. In all places with water conservancy facilities, we should try our best to develop hydraulic machinery and hydroelectric power generation; when designing agricultural machinery, we should try our best to make one thing serve multiple purposes. Our agricultural scientists and technicians should strive to be multi-skilled and multi-talented, and advocate that experts from all walks of life strengthen cooperation, complement each other, and carry out research work from different disciplines and different angles around a common topic. The team of technical innovators in the vast countryside must also have both single-item experiments and comprehensive experiments; both division of labor and close cooperation.
    (III)
    The mass line and launching mass movements are the fundamental line of our Party. We must also launch mass movements in our scientific and technological work.
    Since 1958, driven by the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in Shaanxi Province, a mass movement to vigorously carry out agricultural science and technology work has unfolded. The situation of a few people engaging in scientific and technological work in isolation and coldness has been transformed into a vigorous and enthusiastic great march of thousands of farmers towards science and technology. This is a revolutionary change. It has made Shaanxi Province's agricultural science and technology work shine brightly and take on a new look.
    Due to the vigorous mass movement, the direction of agricultural science and technology work was completely resolved. In the vast ocean of mass movements, the bourgeois academic direction of being divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from the masses was suddenly swept away. The broad masses of farmers engage in science and technology not for science's sake, not to pursue personal fame and gain, but to serve proletarian politics, for socialist construction, for agricultural technological transformation and continuous leap forward in agriculture; they do not look for research topics in documents, nor do they determine research topics according to personal interests, but rather put forward many urgent and major problems from production, conduct experimental research according to the needs of production, and closely combine science and technology with production; they do not talk about war on paper, but rather use real swords and guns; the results they achieve in experimental research are not regarded as private property to be monopolized, but rather used for collective undertakings to promote the development of production. In this way, our agricultural science and technology work is guaranteed to develop at a high speed along the correct direction.
    Due to the vigorous mass movement, a situation of great leap forward in agricultural science and technology work has quickly emerged. Agricultural science and technology work is a major matter directly related to the food and clothing of millions of people. In addition, the natural conditions in the Shaanxi region vary greatly, the varieties of crops are diverse, and the cultivation techniques are also rich and colorful, making the task of carrying out agricultural science and technology work more arduous and complex. If we do not mobilize the masses and rely solely on a small number of professional researchers, we will not be able to complete this task. The facts of the past two years have fully proved that as long as we launch mass movements vigorously, the power will be infinite. Many research projects that were previously considered very difficult have now been completed. For example, the province-wide soil survey work was originally expected to take five years to complete, but once the masses were mobilized, a team of more than 4,000 technical cadres and more than 40,000 farmers was formed. In nine months, the details of the province's more than 60 million mu of soil were basically clarified, with a total of more than 160,000 soil profiles dug, which is 16 times more than what soil scientists across the country dug in 20 years before liberation. Many indicators that were previously unthinkable have now been achieved. The yield of the experimental fields planted by farmers has greatly exceeded the scientific experiments conducted by experts. For example, the Majiapo Production Team of the Chunhua Commune in Sanyuan County averaged 3,000 kilograms of grain per person. The high-yield field of the Gao Zhenxian Group of the Huayin Commune in Weinan County produced 3,290 kilograms of ginned cotton per mu. The masses of farmers have also put forward many valuable experiences and conclusions in production, breaking many stale so-called "scientific theorems," which have not only promoted production but also enriched agricultural scientific theory.
    Due to the vigorous mass movement, a new type of agricultural science and technology team has been rapidly cultivated. This team is vast and includes scientists, technicians, local experts, and advanced producers. They fight on all fronts of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the province. Among them, there are as many as 160,000 members of the Science and Technology Association alone. What is particularly encouraging is the emergence of a group of farmer scientists, such as Wang Baojing, who created the wide-row intercropping cultivation system, Zhang Qiuxiang, a national cotton planting expert, Yang Zengzhan, Ma Dekuan, and Li Caiwa, who implemented comprehensive measures such as diverting water to draw sand and planting trees and grass to turn the desert into fertile fields, Liu Hengjie, a "living Lu Ban" who vigorously engaged in farm tool reform, and Fan Yuqi and Xiong Deyou, who used acupuncture to treat swine fever, and so on. The characteristics of this new type of agricultural science and technology team are: they resolutely listen to the Party's words, and wherever the Party points, they rush there; they have mastered the thought of continuous revolution, despise all difficulties strategically, and have soaring revolutionary drive; they have broken down superstitions, liberated their minds, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and have lofty communist style; they have many people, many opinions, brilliant talents, and infinite wisdom. With such a team, engaging in agricultural science and technology work in a big way, waging war against nature, can achieve victory in every battle and be invincible.
    While launching mass movements vigorously, we have also attached importance to giving play to the role of professional teams, so that professional teams are closely combined with the broad masses. In the past two years, Shaanxi Province's professional agricultural science and technology team has made great progress (including many old experts who actively serve the socialist cause), but both in terms of quantity and quality, it still cannot meet the needs and must continue to be vigorously developed. The professional team is the backbone of agricultural science and technology work, and it is wrong not to pay attention to this. However, professional teams must never be divorced from the masses. Only under the leadership of the Party, participating in mass movements, first being students of the masses, and then being teachers of the masses, and combining their theoretical knowledge with the practical experience of the masses can they fully play their role. In this regard, we have taken many methods: such as establishing connections between scientific research institutions and people's communes and implementing large-scale collaboration; scientific research institutions establishing experimental points in people's communes and moving scientific research work to the fields; professional researchers planting experimental fields with farmers, reforming farm tools together, and summarizing experience together; organizing technical groups to go to the countryside on巡回, learning, summarizing, and promoting at the same time; inviting farmer scientists to scientific research institutions for "consultations" to jointly study problems; inviting farmer scientists to make reports to professional scientists and technicians to impart experience; these methods are very effective. At the same time, launching mass movements vigorously, constantly cultivating scientific and technological talents from the masses, can continuously strengthen and improve the professional team, and fundamentally change the face of the professional team. The reason why our professional team is full of vigor and has strong combat effectiveness is that they come from the masses and constantly draw new blood from the masses to nurture themselves. Therefore, from the perspective of strengthening the professional team, we must also launch mass movements vigorously.
    Whether agricultural science and technology work can launch mass movements in a big way depends on what attitude we use to treat mass movements and new things. The broad masses of farmers engaging in agricultural science and technology work in a big way is a new thing, and it is very good! Although their cultural level is temporarily still relatively low and their experimental research is generally still in the preliminary stage, they represent new forces and represent the correct direction. Therefore, they are the most promising and have the most prospects. We should treat them with full enthusiasm, resolutely protect them, and actively support them. We should never be hypercritical and demand perfection. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China strongly advocates and resolutely supports the new thing of farmers engaging in science and technology in a big way. The Provincial Committee has taken a series of measures to promote farmers to engage in science and technology in a big way and help the scientific and technological talents that have emerged among farmers to improve more quickly. For example, hiring them as researchers at scientific research institutions; sending special personnel to help them summarize experience and write books; creating good experimental research conditions for them in all aspects; holding "hero classes" to help them study; systematically selecting some people to go to universities for further study; organizing them to visit and study in other places; these methods have all achieved good results.
    At present, the mass movement of agricultural science and technology in Shaanxi Province has developed to a new stage. The characteristics of this stage are: "Heroes are in groups, and technologies are in sets." The large-scale and public people's communes, large-scale agricultural technological transformation, large-area high-yield areas, and large-scale operations have created unprecedentedly superior conditions for carrying out agricultural science and technology work, and have also put forward higher requirements for agricultural science and technology work. The single and fragmented experimental research of the past is no longer sufficient. We must engage in comprehensive and systematic scientific and technological research in a big way, so that experimental research institutions are densely networked and scientific and technological achievements are matched into dragons. The scientific and technological talents among farmers must also have greater development. The masses said it well: "A few flowers are not enough, only when the whole garden is blooming can it be spring." Recently, the Provincial Committee decided to launch the "100,000 Red Flag Units and Million Red Flag Hands" movement, which will push the province's agricultural production and agricultural science and technology work to a new climax. Now, regional competitions, boundary competitions, technical expert performance meetings, martial arts arenas, Autumn Fragrance Fields, high-yield fields, command fields are all being carried out enthusiastically. The "one main, two auxiliary, three combinations" movement is developing widely. Various places take production as the main task, vigorously grasp scientific and technological work, and a moving scene of "the whole Party grasping science, the whole people running science, everyone learning science, and science being used everywhere" has emerged; at the same time, education work is being vigorously grasped, with counties running secondary vocational schools and communes running junior vocational schools, cultivating a large number of agricultural science and technology teams. In this way, production, scientific research, and education are combined to achieve a triple harvest of production, scientific research, and technical teams.
    (IV)
    Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and agricultural science and technology is an important condition for ensuring the high-speed development of agriculture. Therefore, the Party's organization must further strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and use more strength to vigorously grasp agricultural science and technology work.
    The Party's correct leadership is to lead with Mao Zedong Thought. Putting politics in command means putting Mao Zedong Thought in command. Like other work, agricultural science and technology work can only move from victory to victory by acting in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's theories. Therefore, we must set off a high tide of learning and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought among agricultural scientists and technicians and farmers, and raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher in the field of agricultural science.
    In the field of scientific and technological work, the main task of the Party's leadership is to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses and scientific and technological workers, carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and ensure that scientific and technological work follows the socialist direction and develops at a high speed.
    Some comrades here believe that in socialist society, there is no resistance to the progress of science and technology. This view actually denies the internal contradictions of socialist society and denies class struggle. It should be affirmed that the socialist system, especially the people's commune system, has greatly liberated the productive forces and opened up broad roads for the development of science and technology. It is wrong not to recognize this. However, if we only see this side and not see the side that there is still resistance to technological progress, there will be a danger of denying contradictions and being divorced from politics. The so-called resistance is contradiction. And contradiction is universally present, and socialist society is no exception. Not only are there contradictions in socialist revolution and socialist construction, but there are also contradictions in technological revolution. The progress of science and technology always involves breaking old concepts and old habits, and always involves removing the lid and being unconventional. All of these will promote the development of socialist construction and the deepening of socialist revolution, and therefore, will inevitably be opposed by habitual forces and conservative forces, mainly by bourgeois intellectuals who have not been thoroughly reformed and a part of the well-to-do middle peasants. The resistance from bourgeois intellectuals is easy for people to understand, but the resistance from a part of the well-to-do middle peasants is not clearly understood by many people. In fact, a part of the well-to-do middle peasants are the representatives of conservative forces in the current countryside. They oppose both revolutionary changes in socio-economics and revolutionary changes in production technology. This is because modern production technology is always linked to large-scale collective production; while manual operation and backward production methods are always mutually dependent on individual small-scale production. In the summer of 1959, when a gust of wind against socialism blew up in the countryside, a part of the well-to-do middle peasants also launched a frenzied attack on technological innovation and the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, which is a good proof. In addition, due to differences in people's ideological understanding and inconsistencies between the subjective and objective, there will be greater or lesser resistance to the progress of science and technology.
    It can be seen that the view that there is no resistance to the progress of science and technology in socialist society is wrong. We must correct this view, adhere to putting politics in command in scientific and technological work, combine technological transformation with the transformation of people, and constantly carry out the struggle between two roads and two lines in scientific and technological work, so as to promote the smooth development of scientific and technological work from the perspective of political ideology.
    In scientific and technological work, we will also encounter many difficulties and resistances in terms of natural conditions and material conditions, and this is nothing to be surprised about. The process of scientific research is originally the process of overcoming difficulties and conquering nature. If there are no difficulties and no resistance, then what kind of scientific research is there? Shaanxi agricultural production has five major disasters, namely: drought, wind and sand, hail, pests and diseases, and soil erosion. These are the unfavorable factors we face. However, as long as we establish the ambition that "man can conquer nature," carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and resolutely fight against natural disasters, these unfavorable factors will stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses, promote the development of production, and become favorable factors. The more difficulties and the greater the resistance, the more likely it is to produce science and produce talents. The Weibei Plateau in Shaanxi Province is more seriously affected by drought, and in these places, the progress of water conservancy is the fastest, and there are also the most creative inventions in water conservancy machinery, which is a good proof that unfavorable factors have become favorable factors.
    In short, we must strengthen the Party's leadership under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, correctly implement a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies, rely on the masses, launch a mass movement of technological innovation and scientific research in a big way, and strive to climb to the peak of agricultural science and technology in a not-too-long period of time, so as to powerfully promote the modernization of agriculture in our country.

    在毛泽东思想指导下，加强农业科学技术工作
    中共陕西省委候补书记　　赵守一
    （一）
    党中央和毛泽东同志最近强调地提出了加强农业战线、加速实现农业技术改造的任务。为了完成这个任务，就必须在毛泽东思想指导下，大力加强农业科学技术工作。
    马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，是指导我国革命和建设事业的唯一正确的思想，任何工作都不能离开这个指导思想，农业科学技术工作同样不能例外。有人以为：“毛泽东思想只能指导社会科学，不能指导自然科学。”这是完全错误的。固然，自然科学的研究对象没有阶级性，但是，研究和掌握自然科学的人却是有阶级性的。自然科学的研究，不能不受一定的世界观的指导，自然科学的运用，不能不受一定的方针、政策的指导。关于科学的发展道路，毛泽东同志有一套完整的学说。例如，科学为生产服务，理论与实践结合，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，等等。只有遵循毛泽东同志的这些学说，才能在科学技术工作中，坚持社会主义、共产主义的政治方向，坚持多快好省的正确路线。毛泽东同志在运用辩证唯物主义总结我国农业生产经验和农业科学研究成果方面，也树立了光辉的榜样。毛泽东同志提出了农业增产的“八字宪法”，并且不断地发展了各项增产措施的具体内容；最近又提出了农林牧三者互相依赖、缺一不可的原理。这些原理不仅推动了农业生产的大跃进，而且创造性地发展了农业科学的理论。所以，农业科学技术工作一定要以毛泽东思想为指导思想。
    同全国各地一样，陕西省的农业科学技术工作是在坚持毛泽东同志指出的科学发展方向，反对技术脱离政治、理论脱离实际、专家脱离群众的资产阶级倾向中发展起来的；是在毛泽东同志规定的一套“两条腿走路”的方针指导下发展起来的；是在围绕农业“八字宪法”进行试验研究中发展起来的。现在，全省五十二个县、市和绝大部分人民公社，都建立了农业科学研究机构。从陕北高原到八百里秦川，从秦岭山麓到汉江两岸，科学技术网纵横交错；专业研究人员同农民群众互相结合蔚为风气；百万以上的农民围绕着农业“八字宪法”，展开了多种多样的试验研究；科学研究和技术革新的新成就硕果累累，层出不穷。农业科学技术工作的迅速发展，有力地推动了农业生产的持续跃进。1958年，陕西省的农业生产获得了史无前例的特大丰收；1959年，虽然遭受了数十年未有的百日大旱，但是农副业的总产值仍比大跃进的1958年增长了12％以上。过去，我们在毛泽东思想指导下取得了如此巨大的成绩；今后，我们要更加自觉地学习和运用毛泽东思想，更加有效地加强农业科学技术工作，尽快地实现农业技术改造的任务，把我们的农业生产和农业科学推向新的高峰。
    （二）
    加强农业科学技术工作，必须采取正确的方针。在这一方面，毛泽东同志有许多宝贵的提示。我们体会最深的是，开展农业科学技术工作必须采取普及和提高相结合、学习现代科学和发扬优良传统相结合、单项试验和综合研究相结合等一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。
    普及和提高相结合
    “普及和提高结合”，“洋法和土法并举”，这是发展科学技术的一条正确方针，是毛泽东同志关于经济建设也是关于科学技术工作的思想的一个重要内容。我们开展农业科学技术工作的目的，是要用最先进的技术把农业武装起来，用最快的速度攀登世界农业科学的高峰。在这个问题上，心要雄，志要壮，决不能甘居中游。有人以为农业很简单，仅仅是春耕夏耘秋收冬藏，没有高深的学问，只需要普及不需要提高，这是一种眼光短浅的看法，是懒汉懦夫的看法。事实上，农业要管天管地管庄稼，要掌握变化无常、千差万别的天时地利，要研究有生命的动物和植物，这决不是一件简单的事情。特别是现在，要实现农业现代化，要把先进的科学技术运用到如此复杂的农业生产中来，没有很高的科学技术水平，显然是不行的。因此，我们一定要大抓提高、猛攻尖端。为了实现这个目的，可以有两种途径：一种是忽视普及、孤立地提高，只抓现代化的科学技术，不抓那些简单易行的、直接为当前生产服务的科学技术；另一种是土洋并举，由土到洋，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。事实证明，前者是少慢差费的道路，后者是多快好省的道路。后一条道路的好处很多。首先，它由简到繁，易于掌握，能够立竿见影地解决当前生产中大量存在的问题。例如，延安延惠渠工地全面实现了土机械化和挖土爆破化，基本上消灭了肩挑背负和人力掘土的现象，每人每日完成二十三个土方，比一般工效高出五倍到六倍。1959年全省采用埋土切叶法，有效地控制了小麦条锈病的蔓延。鄠县养猪能手刘秀英创造的人工控制雌雄性的方法，解决了大量繁殖母猪的问题。这些事实都说明，土办法能够解决大问题。
    其次，由土到洋，土中出洋，可以训练队伍，积累经验，为迅速提高打下稳固的基础。譬如，在进行农具改良和半机械化的过程中，可以更好地了解各个农作区的自然条件、作物品种和耕作方法的不同情况，使农业机具能够适应这些特点；可以使农民群众逐步掌握运用农业机具的能力，并且从群众中培养出一批革新技术的能手，为全面实现机械化、电气化训练干部、积累经验。
    土和洋是不能截然分开的。土中有洋，伟大出于平凡。简便易行的科学技术中常常产生最先进的东西。例如，榆林专区采用以水拉沙、冲沙打地的方法，把几十万亩沙漠变为良田，其中最突出的是榆林县归德堡公社、花园沟生产队，创造了沙田平均亩产一千五百斤的高额丰产纪录。三原县农民范玉奇、熊德有运用针灸治疗猪瘟，疗效达到80％—90％。群众说：“不怕瘟疫缠猪身，只要范熊扎一针”。以水拉沙和针灸治猪瘟都是土办法，但也是最先进的技术。
    总之，一切事物的发展都有一个由低级到高级的过程，我们必须掌握这个规律。在农业科学技术工作方面，既要树立攀登世界高峰的雄心壮志，又要脚踏实地一步一步前进；既要从洋着眼，又要从土着手；既要猛攻尖端，又要大抓那些直接为当前生产服务的科学技术问题；要把两者很好地结合起来。
    学习现代农业科学和发扬优良传统相结合
    我国农业生产的技术水平，有落后的一面，也有先进的一面。就是说，生产工具是落后的，主要的使用着手工工具和畜力工具；耕作方法是先进的，具有几千年来逐步形成、并在大跃进以来得到全面发展的精耕细作的优良传统。我国农业科学的水平，同样有落后的一面和先进的一面。就是说，农业科学的理论是不够系统的；农业生产的经验是无比丰富的。我们必须全面估计这种又落后、又先进的状况。一方面要坚定地实现农业的技术改造；另一方面又要保持和发扬精耕细作的优良传统。一方面要学习和研究现代的农业科学；另一方面又要运用现代农业科学，总结和提高我国农业生产的丰富经验。把这两个方面很好地结合起来，就能创造出既是现代化又具有中国特点的农业科学技术成果，攀登世界农业科学的高峰。
    毛泽东同志最善于把现代农业科学同我国农业生产的丰富经验巧妙地结合起来。农业增产的“八字宪法”，正是两者结合的产物。毛泽东同志把农业增产的基本因素，最系统、最集中、最鲜明地概括为土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工等八个字，并且在每一项增产因素中，创造性地提出了合乎自然发展规律的方针与措施。例如，在土壤方面，根据深耕可以促进土壤熟化的原理，和农民群众中流行的“深耕一寸土，多打一斗粮”的经验，提出了以深耕为中心的改良土壤的方针。在肥料方面，根据我国农业生产一贯采用有机肥料的传统，和农民群众中流行的“猪多肥多、肥多粮多”的经验，提出了以养猪为中心，实行有机肥料和无机肥料并举的方针。在水利方面，根据水可以为患也可以兴利的规律，总结了我国历史上蓄水与泄水两条治水路线的争论，提出了蓄水为主的方针。毛泽东同志的这些创造性的贡献，不仅指导和推动了我国农业生产的持续跃进，同时也大大地丰富了农业科学的内容。
    我们必须学习毛泽东同志的榜样，把实现农业现代化和发扬我国农业生产的优良传统结合起来，把学习现代农业科学和总结农民群众的生产经验结合起来；在目前，特别要注意解决农业机械化同精耕细作互相适应的问题。例如，在我国农业的耕作过程中，田间管理的活路最多、作务最细，农民群众中流行着“三分种、七分管”的说法。为了适应田间管理的需要，农业的机械化，就不能仅仅着眼于耕、种、收、打的大型机具，而要同时考虑到用于田间管理的小型、精密机具。再如，水平梯田、区田、套种间作等等，是我国特有的耕作制度和耕作方法，农业机械化如何适应这些特点，也必须加以具体研究，采取适当措施。总之，我们的农业机械化，必须同时适应提高劳动生产率和提高单位面积产量两方面的需要，既不能满足于原有的耕作技术，延缓机械化的进度，又不能只顾实现机械化，而丢掉了我国固有的优良传统和丰富经验。
    单项试验和综合研究相结合
    自然现象是互相联系、互相制约的。从这个基本观点出发，党和毛泽东同志阐明了动物的粪便是植物的粮食，植物是动物的粮食，动物是人类的粮食的辩证关系，从而确定了农林牧副渔综合发展的农业生产方针。从这个基本观点出发，党和毛泽东同志又指出“八字宪法”中土壤是基础，水、肥、种是前提，合理密植是中心，保、管、工是基本保证，从而确定了各项增产措施综合运用的方向。党和毛泽东同志所指出的综合发展、综合运用的方向，在农业生产和农业科学的发展中，已经发挥了巨大的作用。就我们陕西省的事例来说，兴平县普集公社肖马生产队，实行了农、牧业综合发展，在一年多的时间里，生猪猛增二十倍，农田施肥量增加了两倍多，小麦产量提高了近两倍。商南县武关公社八一生产队在山坡地实行农林混种法，使每亩土地的经济收入增加了40％以上。在增产措施的综合运用方面，作用也很显著。根据调查，兴平县扬陵人民公社杜家坡生产队，在种植小麦方面，综合措施配合得好的和配合不好的，结果显然两样。十二号田块，播种量较上年增加43．75％，施肥量增加12％，耕深增加二寸，综合措施配合得好，结果产量增加了28．9％，劳动生产率提高了3．4％，生产费用降低了4％。十一号田块，播种量较上年增加37．5％，但是，肥料施得太少，耕的深度不够，结果减产48．6％，劳动生产率降低了48．9％，生产费用增加了131．2％。再如，苹果隔年结果的问题，过去人们仅仅从果树品种方面去找寻原因，错误地认为这是无法改变的自然规律。近几年来，陕西农业综合试验站从土壤、栽培、施肥、防治病虫害等各方面去找寻原因，采取综合措施，终于解决了这个重要的科学问题，使苹果年年丰产，产量直线上升。这些事实说明，综合发展、综合运用是发展农业生产的一条多快好省的道路。当然我们也不能忽视单项试验，只有通过单项试验深入了解各种因子的具体规律，才能更好地进行综合研究。因此我们在农业科学技术工作中，必须把试验室、试验农场的实验和大面积的丰产经验结合起来，把单项试验和综合研究结合起来。从综合运用的要求出发来进行单项试验，探索新的增产途径，在单项试验的基础上进行综合研究，找寻各项增产措施之间的内在联系，实现综合运用的目的。在农业机械化和半机械化当中，也要注意综合利用。在一切有水利设施的地方，要尽量发展水力机械和水力发电；在设计农业机具的时候，要尽量作到一物多用。我们的农业科学技术人员应当力求作到一专多能，并且提倡各行各业的专家加强协作，互相补充，围绕着一个共同的课题，从不同的学科和不同的角度来进行研究工作。广大农村中的技术革新的队伍，也必须既有单项试验，又有综合试验；既有分工，又能密切配合。
    （三）
    走群众路线，大搞群众运动，是我们党的根本路线。我们开展科学技术工作，也必须大搞群众运动。
    1958年以来，陕西省在工农业生产大跃进的推动下，一个大搞农业科学技术工作的群众运动展开了。少数人孤零零、冷清清地搞科学技术工作的状况，一变而为轰轰烈烈的、热气腾腾的千万农民向科学技术的大进军。这是一个革命性的变化。它使陕西省农业科学技术工作大放异彩，面貌一新。
    由于大搞群众运动，彻底解决了农业科学技术工作的方向问题。在群众运动的汪洋大海里，脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离群众的资产阶级治学方向，一下子冲垮了。广大农民搞科学技术，不是为科学而科学，不是追求个人名利，而是为无产阶级政治服务，为了社会主义建设，为了农业技术改造和农业持续跃进；他们不是从文献里找研究题目，不是按照个人的兴趣确定研究题目，而是从生产当中提出许多迫切的、重大的问题，根据生产的需要进行试验研究，把科学技术同生产紧密地结合起来；他们不是纸上谈兵，而是真刀真枪；他们在试验研究中取得的成果，不是当作私人财产，加以垄断，而是用于集体事业，推动生产的发展。这样，就保证了我们的农业科学技术工作，沿着正确的方向高速度地发展。
    由于大搞群众运动，迅速出现了农业科学技术工作大跃进的局面。农业科学技术工作，是直接关系到千百万人民吃饭穿衣的大事情，加以陕西地区自然条件千差万别，作物品种多种多样，耕作技术也是丰富多彩，开展农业科学技术工作的任务更加繁重和复杂。如果不发动群众，单靠少数专业研究人员，是不能完成这个任务的。两年来的事实充分证明，只要大搞群众运动，威力就无穷无尽。许多过去认为很困难的研究项目，现在完成了。像全省土壤普查工作，原来预计五年才能完成，可是一发动群众，组成了一支有四千多技术干部和四万多农民参加的队伍，九个月时间，就把全省六千多万亩土壤的底细基本上摸清了，一共挖了十六万多个土壤破面，比解放前全国土壤科学工作者在二十年中所挖的要多十六倍。许多过去连想也不敢想的指标，现在达到了。农民种的试验田，产量大大超过了专家们搞的科学试验。像三原县淳化公社马家坡生产队，平均每人收粮三千斤。渭南县华阴公社高贞贤小组的丰产田，亩产籽棉三千二百九十斤。农民群众在生产中还提出了许多宝贵的经验和结论，打破了许多陈腐的所谓“科学定理”，不仅推动了生产，而且丰富了农业科学理论。
    由于大搞群众运动，迅速地培养出一支新型的农业科学技术队伍。这支队伍浩浩荡荡，包括科学家、技术人员、土专家和先进生产者。他们战斗在全省农林牧副渔各个战线上。其中光是科学技术协会的会员，就有十六万之多。特别令人振奋的，是出现了一批农民科学家，像创造宽行套种间作耕作制度的王保京，全国植棉能手张秋香，实行引水拉沙和植树种草等综合措施，把沙漠变成良田的杨增占、马德宽和李财娃，大搞农具改革的“活鲁班”刘恒杰，用针灸治猪瘟的范玉奇和熊德有，等等。这支新型农业科学技术队伍的特点是：他们坚决听党的话，党指向哪里，他们奔向那里；他们掌握了不断革命的思想，在战略上藐视一切困难，有着冲天的革命干劲；他们破除了迷信，解放了思想，敢想敢说敢干，有着崇高的共产主义风格；他们人多议论多，才华焕发，智慧无穷。有了这样一支队伍，大搞农业科学技术工作，向大自然开战，就能够百战百胜，所向披靡。
    在大搞群众运动的同时，我们也重视了发挥专业队伍的作用，使专业队伍同广大群众密切结合。两年以来，陕西省农业科学技术的专业队伍，有了很大发展（其中包括许多积极为社会主义事业服务的老专家），但是无论在数量上和质量上，都还不能满足需要，必须继续大力发展。专业队伍是农业科学技术工作的骨干，不重视这一点，是不对的。但是，专业队伍决不能脱离群众，他们只有在党的领导下，参加群众运动，先当群众的学生，再当群众的先生，把自己的理论知识同群众的实际经验结合起来，才能充分地发挥作用。在这方面，我们采取了许多方法：如科学研究机关同人民公社建立联系，实行大协作；科学研究机关在人民公社建立试验点，把科学研究工作搬到田间；专业研究人员同农民一起种试验田，一起改革农具，一起总结经验；组织技术团下乡巡回，边学习、边总结、边推广；邀请农民科学家到科学研究机关“会诊”，共同研究问题；邀请农民科学家向专业科学技术人员作报告，传授经验；这些方法都是很有效的。同时，大搞群众运动，从群众当中不断培养出科学技术人材，又可以不断地壮大和提高专业队伍，并且从根本上改变专业队伍的面貌。我们的专业队伍之所以朝气勃勃，富有战斗力，就是因为他们来自群众，不断地从群众中吸取新的血液来哺育自己。所以，从加强专业队伍这一点来看，也必须大搞群众运动。
    农业科学技术工作能不能大搞群众运动，关键在于我们用什么态度对待群众运动，对待新生事物。广大农民大搞农业科学技术工作，这是一种新生事物，好得很！虽然他们的文化水平暂时还比较低，他们的试验研究一般地还处在初级阶段，但是他们代表新生力量，代表正确方向，因此，他们最有希望，最有前途。我们对待他们，应当满腔热情，坚决保护，积极扶植，决不应当吹毛求疵，求全责备。中共陕西省委对于农民大搞科学技术这一新生事物，是大力提倡和坚决支持的。省委采取了一系列的办法，促使农民大搞科学技术，帮助农民中出现的科学技术人材更快地提高。例如聘请他们担任科学研究机关的研究员；派专人帮助他们总结经验、著书立说；从各方面为他们创造良好的试验研究条件；举办“群英班”，帮助他们学习；有计划地选送一些人到高等学校深造；组织他们到外地参观学习；这些方法都收到了良好的效果。
    目前，陕西省农业科学技术的群众运动，已经发展到一个新的阶段。这个阶段的特点是：“英雄成群，技术成套”。一大二公的人民公社，大规模的农业技术改造，大面积丰产方，大兵团作战，为开展农业科学技术工作创造了前所未有的优越条件，同时也向农业科学技术工作提出了更高的要求。过去那种单项的、零碎的试验研究，已经很不够了，必须大搞综合的、系统的科学技术研究，使试验研究机构密集成网，科学技术成果配套成龙。农民当中的科学技术人材，也必须有更大的发展。群众说得好：“几朵花儿还不够，万紫千红才是春。”最近，省委决定开展“十万红旗单位和百万红旗手”运动，这个运动将会把全省农业生产和农业科学技术工作，推向新的高潮。现在，地区赛，边界赛，技术能手表演会，比武擂台，秋香田，丰产田，指挥田，到处搞得热火朝天。“一主二辅三结合”的运动，正在广泛发展。各地以生产为主，大抓科学技术工作，出现了“全党抓科学，全民办科学，人人学科学，处处用科学”的动人场面；同时大抓教育工作，县县办中技，社社办初技，大量培养农业科学技术队伍。这样，做到生产、科学研究和教育三结合，实现生产、科学研究和技术队伍三丰收。
    （四）
    农业是国民经济发展的基础，农业科学技术又是保证农业高速度发展的重要条件。因此，党的组织必须进一步加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，用更多的力量，大抓农业科学技术工作。
    党的正确领导，就是用毛泽东思想领导。政治挂帅，就是毛泽东思想挂帅。同其他工作一样，农业科学技术工作，只有按照毛泽东同志的学说办事，才能从胜利走向胜利。因此，我们必须在农业科学技术人员和农民群众中，掀起一个学习和宣传毛泽东思想的高潮，在农业科学领域里，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗。
    在科学技术工作方面，党的领导的主要任务，是调动广大群众和科学技术工作者的积极性，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，保证科学技术工作遵循社会主义的方向高速度地发展。
    我们这里有些同志认为，在社会主义社会里，科学技术的进步没有阻力。这种观点，实际上是否认了社会主义社会的内部矛盾，否认了阶级斗争。应该肯定，社会主义制度，特别是人民公社制度，大大解放了生产力，为科学技术的发展开辟了广阔的道路，不承认这一点是不对的。但是，如果只看到这一面，而看不到技术进步还有阻力的一面，就会产生否认矛盾、脱离政治的危险。所谓阻力，就是矛盾。而矛盾是普遍存在的，社会主义社会也不能例外。不仅社会主义革命和社会主义建设中存在着矛盾，技术革命中，同样存在着矛盾。科学技术的进步，总是要打破旧观念、旧习惯，总是要揭掉盖子、标新立异的。所有这些，都会促进社会主义建设的发展和社会主义革命的深入，因而，必然会受到习惯势力、保守势力的反对，主要会受到未经彻底改造的资产阶级知识分子和一部分富裕中农的反对。来自资产阶级知识分子方面的阻力，人们是容易理解的，而来自一部分富裕中农方面的阻力，许多人还认识不清楚。事实上，一部分富裕中农是目前农村中保守势力的代表。他们既反对社会经济方面的革命性变革，也反对生产技术方面的革命性变革。这是因为，现代化的生产技术总是同大规模的集体生产联系在一起的；而手工操作和落后的生产方法总是同个体小生产互相依赖的。1959年夏天，当农村中刮起一阵反对社会主义妖风的时候，一部分富裕中农对于技术革新和农业增产的“八字宪法”，也进行了猖狂的攻击，就是一个很好的证明。此外，由于人们思想认识的差别，主观和客观的不一致，对于科学技术的进步也会产生或大或小的阻力。
    由此可见，那种认为在社会主义社会中，科学技术的进步没有阻力的看法，是错误的。我们必须纠正这种看法，在科学技术工作中，坚持政治挂帅，把技术改造和对人的改造结合起来，经常地开展科学技术工作中两条道路和两条路线的斗争，从政治思想方面促进科学技术工作顺利的发展。
    在科学技术工作中，还会碰到许多自然条件和物质条件方面的困难和阻力，这也用不着奇怪。科学研究的过程，本来就是克服困难、征服自然的过程。如果没有困难、没有阻力，那还搞什么科学研究呢？陕西农业生产上有五大灾害，即：干旱、风沙、冰雹、病虫害和水土流失。这是我们面临的不利因素。但是，只要我们树立“人定胜天”的雄心壮志，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，坚决同自然灾害作斗争，这些不利因素又会激发群众的干劲，促进生产的发展，变成有利因素。困难越多、阻力越大的地方，往往就是出科学、出人材的地方。陕西省的渭北高原干旱比较严重，而这些地方，水利化的进展最快，水利机械方面的创造发明也最多，这就是不利因素变成有利因素的一个很好的证明。
    总之，我们一定要在毛泽东思想的指导下，加强党的领导，正确执行一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，依靠群众、大搞技术革新和科学研究的群众运动，力争在不太长的时间内攀登农业科学技术的高峰，有力地促进我国农业的现代化。
