Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Employees of the First Business Station of the Suzhou Shipping Company in Jiangsu Province recently successfully trial-produced a hold bottom unloader, breaking through a weak link in loading and unloading operations. This is of great significance for the comprehensive realization of port loading and unloading mechanization and serialization.

The hold bottom unloader is a machine that automatically unloads bulk materials such as coal, gravel, and yellow sand from the ship's hold to the shore. For many years, in small and medium-sized ports, the unloading of bulk materials relied entirely on manual labor, which was not only labor-intensive but also prolonged the time ships spent docked, affecting turnover. For example, a ship carrying eighteen tons of coal from the city's coal station to the unloading point—the Dongfeng Coking Plant—took about forty minutes to load and fifteen minutes to travel; however, manually unloading the coal onto the dock required six or seven workers working for more than three hours. With the unloader, this time is no longer needed. Workers simply turn on the power, and the machine rotates flexibly, allowing materials in the hold to fall through the movable hatch cover onto the conveyor belt, which carries them to the bow of the ship and unloads them onto a conveyor connected to the dock, directly transferring them to the shore. A ship carrying eighteen tons of coal can be unloaded in thirty minutes, five times faster than manual labor, and greatly reducing labor intensity.

Using this unloader in conjunction with other transport machines used on the docks creates a complete set of unloading machinery, enabling the complete mechanization of bulk material unloading, shortening the docking time of cargo ships, and accelerating ship turnover. In the past, a barge carrying eighteen tons of coal could only make four to five round trips between the coal station and the coking plant per day due to the long unloading time, but now it can make twelve to thirteen trips per day, meaning one ship can do the work of three.

This unloader mainly consists of a small 2.8-kilowatt motor and a conveyor belt. Except for the motor and twenty-two rollers of various sizes, the rest of the components are made of wood. The machine is only eight meters long and forty centimeters high, and is fixedly installed at the bottom of the ship's hold. When loading, wooden boards are first placed on both sides of the unloading surface, with a movable cover plate on top, and bulk cargo is piled on the cover plate. When arriving at the dock for unloading, simply start the motor, remove the movable cover plate, and the bulk cargo will automatically fall onto the conveyor belt and be sent to the conveyor on the dock connected to the unloader. The whole process requires only two people to manage and is more efficient than the original seven people manually carrying and lifting.

In recent years, the vast number of employees in the Suzhou transportation system have made many reforms in loading and unloading technology. However, the loading and unloading of bulk materials remained a weak link, relying on manual labor. In order to break through this weak link, the Suzhou Municipal Transportation Department Party Committee mobilized employees in the transportation system in late January to solve the technical problems of unloading from the hold. The First Business Station of the Municipal Shipping Company immediately established a technical innovation group with leading cadres, technicians, and workers to conduct special research. Based on the principle of the larger conveyor structures on the docks, they designed a small conveyor that could be placed in the ship's hold. After several trials and improvements, and with the support of relevant municipal departments and brother factories, they overcame difficulties in materials and manufacturing technology and successfully trial-produced this hold bottom unloader in just seven days. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation has sent people to the business station to summarize their experience and prepare to promote it in other shipping areas.

### 港口装卸机械化的一个薄弱环节突破了  苏州制成船底起舱机

    港口装卸机械化的一个薄弱环节突破了
    苏州制成船底起舱机
    新华社南京电　江苏省苏州市航运公司第一营业站职工最近试制成功一种船底起舱机，突破了装卸作业中的薄弱环节，对全面实现港口装卸机械化、系列化有着重大的意义。
    船底起舱机，是把船舱中的散装物资，如煤、碎石、黄砂等自动起卸到岸上的一种机器。多少年来，在中小港口起卸散货物资，全靠肩扛人抬，不仅劳动强度高，还延长了船只停靠码头的时间，影响周转。例如，一只载重十八吨的船从这个市的煤站运煤到卸货点——东风焦化厂，车子装货的时间约四十多分钟，途中航行十五分钟；而人力把煤起卸到码头上，却需要六、七个工人工作三个多小时。有了起舱机，就不需要这么长的时间了。工人只要打开电门，机器便灵活地转动起来，船舱里的物资就通过活路盖板口漏到输送带上，被带到船头，卸到接连码头上的输送机里，直接送到岸上。一只载装十八吨煤的船，三十分钟就卸完了，比人力扛快了五倍，并且大大减轻了劳动强度。
    用这种起舱机和码头上用的其他运输机配成整套卸货机械，使散装物资卸货全部实现了机械化，缩短了货船码头停靠时间，加速了船只的周转。过去一只载重十八吨的驳船，从煤站运到焦化厂，由于卸货时间长，一昼夜只能往返四到五次，而现在一昼夜能航行十二到十三次，一只船能抵上了原来三只船用。
    这台起舱机主要是由一个二点八瓩的小马达和输送带构成，除马达和二十二只大小滚筒外，其余部件都是用木料做的。机器只有八米长、四十厘米高，固定安装在船舱的底部。载货时，先在起舱面两侧隔上木板，上面装一活动盖板，把散装货物堆放在盖板上，到达码头卸货时，只要开动马达，抽开活动盖板，散装货物即可自动漏到输送带上，被送到与起舱机衔接的码头上的输送机上。整个工作只需要两个人管理，比原来七个人力扛抬效率还高。
    几年来，苏州运输系统的广大职工，在装卸技术上已经进行了很多改革。但是，散装物资的起卸工作仍是人力肩扛，一直是薄弱环节。为了突破这个薄弱环节，市交通部门党委在1月下旬发动运输系统的职工，解决起舱的技术问题。市航运公司第一营业站随即成立了有领导干部、技术人员和工人参加的技术革新组，进行专门研究。他们根据码头上较大型输送机构造的原理，设计了一个小型的可以放入船舱的输送机。经过数次试验和改进，在市有关部门和兄弟厂的支持下，克服了材料和制造技术的困难，先后仅七天时间，就把这台船底起舱机械试制成功了。现在，江苏省交通厅已经派人到营业站总结他们的经验，准备在其他航运地段推广。
