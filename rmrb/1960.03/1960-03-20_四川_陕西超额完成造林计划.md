Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 19th: Sichuan Province has completed its annual afforestation plan ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 18.3%. In addition to planting a large number of scattered trees, various regions have also extensively created thousands of mu forests and tens of thousands of mu forests on barren mountains.

While vigorously developing timber forests, various regions have paid special attention to developing economic forests based on local characteristics. Wanxian and Fuling regions have created more than 7 million mu of economic forests mainly of tung oil trees and oil tea trees; Nanchong, Neijiang, and Mianyang and other places have vigorously developed mulberry trees; Jiangjin, Jintang and other places have planted a large number of citrus trees; Yibin, Leshan, Ya'an and other places have vigorously expanded tea plantations. Various regions have also planted bamboo along rivers and around residences.

Currently, various regions are pressing ahead with victories and carrying out spring seedling cultivation activities. Leshan region has nearly completed its annual seedling cultivation task, and Meishan, Jiajiang and other counties are cultivating seedlings on more than 1,000 mu. Many areas are combining the planting of early spring crops and the sowing of major spring crops to implement intercropping of agriculture and forestry, tending newly planted young forests and existing old forests, and combining crop cultivation and livestock development to achieve livestock raising for the forest, striving to achieve a triple harvest of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry.

As early as last autumn and winter, Sichuan Province launched a vigorous seed collection campaign, collecting 40 million catties of various forest tree seeds, and made plans for the dispatch and transfer of seedlings. Since the beginning of this year, various regions have successively established afforestation and greening command organizations, led by the secretaries of Party committees at all levels, combined with agricultural production activities such as small spring field management, water conservancy construction, and manure accumulation and fertilizer production, setting off wave after wave of afforestation upsurge.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 19th: Shaanxi Province has completed its annual afforestation plan ahead of schedule. As of the 11th, the province's spring afforestation area reached 10,087,000 mu, exceeding the annual afforestation plan by 8.7%; in addition, more than 400 million individual trees were planted. At present, various regions are stepping up the tending of young forests.

Shaanxi's afforestation work this spring started early and was tightly grasped, giving full play to the power of the people's communes, concentrating on tackling afforestation in whole areas, so it started with a strong momentum, large scale, rapid progress, and good quality. Most areas dug fish-scale pits and opened horizontal ditches before afforestation.

Youths in various regions are very active and energetic in afforestation. Taking seed preparation as an example, the province's youths have collected more than 13,000 catties of various tree seeds and cultivated more than 300,000 mu of seedlings.

Developing towards forestry base construction, forest farm management, and high-yield forest cultivation is another feature of Shaanxi's afforestation this spring. The timber forest base built in Hanzhong region accounts for more than 40% of the total afforestation area. Shangluo region, which is famous throughout the country for walnuts, has newly built more than 2,800 walnut gullies, more than 12,000 walnut slopes, and more than 2,000 li of walnut roads, vigorously propagating walnuts. Many communes have combined the characteristics of their areas to build new economic forest bases for grapes, oil tea, rosin, persimmons, peaches, dates, and Chinese prickly ash.

    四川  陕西超额完成造林计划
    据新华社成都19日电　四川省已提前超额18．3％完成全年造林计划。各地除了种植大批零星树木以外，还在成片的荒山上，广泛营造千亩林、万亩林。
    各地在大力发展用材林时，特别注意根据各地特点发展经济林木。万县、涪陵两专区营造了以油桐、油茶为主的经济林七百多万亩；南充、内江、绵阳等地大力发展了桑树；江津、金堂等地大量栽植了柑桔；宜宾、乐山、雅安等地大力扩大了茶园。各地还在江河两岸和住宅周围种了竹子。
    目前，各地正乘胜挺进，开展了春季育苗活动。乐山专区已接近完成全年育苗任务，眉山、夹江等县，育苗都在千亩以上。不少地区正结合种植早春作物和大春播种，实行农林间作，抚育新栽幼林和原有老林，并把农作物的栽培管理和发展畜牧业结合起来，做到以牧养林，争取实现农林牧三丰收。
    四川省早在去年秋冬，各地就开展了轰轰烈烈的采种运动，采集了各种林木种子四千万斤，作好了苗木出山调运的规划。今年以来，各地又陆续建立了造林绿化指挥机构，由各级党委书记挂帅，结合小春田间管理、兴修水利、积肥造肥等农业生产活动，掀起了一浪赶一浪的造林高潮。
    据新华社西安19日电　陕西省已提前超额完成全年造林计划。到11日止，全省春季造林面积达到一千零八十七万亩，超额8．7％完成全年造林计划；此外，零星植树共四亿多株。目前，各地正抓紧幼林抚育工作。
    陕西今春造林工作动手早、抓得紧，充分发挥了人民公社的威力，集中突击整片造林，所以一开始就来势猛，规模大，进展快，质量好。大部分地区都先挖好鱼鳞坑，开出水平沟，然后才造林。
    各地青少年在造林中十分活跃，干劲很大。仅以种苗准备来说，全省青少年就采集了各种树种一万三千多斤、育苗三十多万亩。
    向林业基地化、经营管理林场化、林木培育丰产化的方向发展，是陕西省今春造林的另一特点。汉中专区营造的用材林基地占造林总面积40％以上。以核桃驰名全国的商?专区，新造核桃沟二千八百多条、核桃坡一万二千多面、核桃路两千多里，大力繁殖核桃。许多公社都结合本地区的特点，新建了葡萄、油茶、松香、柿、桃、枣、花椒等经济林木基地。
