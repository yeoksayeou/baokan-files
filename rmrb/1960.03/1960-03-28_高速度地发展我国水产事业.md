Two Years of High-Speed Development of China's Aquaculture Industry

Our people are marching towards nature. We must make full use of natural resources for socialist construction, advancing not only into plains and mountainous areas, but also into aquatic areas. The basic task of the aquaculture front is to continuously leap forward under the guidance of the Party's General Line, developing aquatic production at high speed and raising the aquaculture industry from a backward state to a modern level of science and technology, serving to improve people's lives and support the country's socialist construction.

Over the past decade, under the correct leadership of the Party, China's aquaculture industry, like other sectors of the national economy, has developed very rapidly.

China's total aquatic output increased from 3.12 million tons in 1957 to 5.02 million tons in 1959, an increase of 60.6%, with an average annual increase of 26.8%, doubling the average annual increase of 13.3% from 1953 to 1957. In particular, in 1958 and 1959, the absolute increase in China's aquatic production was 1.9 million tons, which was 131% of the cumulative increase of 1.45 million tons in the five years from 1953 to 1957. There is no doubt that this is a huge leap forward. If the average annual increase of 13.3% in China during the First Five-Year Plan was already incomparable to that of the three most developed capitalist countries in the aquaculture industry (Japan's average annual increase was 3%, the United States 2.8%, and the United Kingdom declined), then the great leap forward in China's aquaculture industry since 1958, with an average annual increase of 26.8%, is something that capitalist countries cannot even dream of.

1958 and 1959 were also the two years in which China's aquaculture field expanded the most. The area of marine and freshwater aquaculture has greatly expanded, and many water areas that were previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture, such as bays, beaches, lake branches, river ports, and so-called dead water, rapids, hard water, and sewage, can also be used for aquaculture after water surface renovation and water quality improvement. Some mountainous and plateau areas that never raised fish have also become lands of fish and rice, which has greatly changed the distribution of aquaculture production in China. The variety of aquaculture has also greatly increased. Many varieties that were previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture, such as bream, black fish, prawns, crabs, sea cucumbers, seahorses, kelp, and mussels, have undergone artificial incubation and domestication and have been artificially farmed, transforming wild species into domestic species, thereby further incorporating aquaculture production into planned production according to our will. In terms of fishing, new fishing grounds have also been opened up, and new varieties such as whales, seals, seahorses, and sea turtles, which did not exist in the past, have been developed. The three-dimensional utilization of water areas has also taken a big step forward. For example, the creation of all-purpose nets and all-purpose fishing has provided conditions for catching fish in the upper, middle, and lower layers; and the mixed stocking of fish of different water layers and habits has made fuller use of the water in three dimensions. In terms of the comprehensive utilization of aquatic products, more than 100 new products have been successfully trial-produced and refined in the past two years, such as alginic acid, fish scale glue, mannitol, iodine-soluble chitin, etc., which greatly improved the utilization rate and economic value of aquatic products and provided cheap and important raw materials for industry, agriculture, and medicine. As our understanding of nature gradually deepens, the infinite potential of water areas will be increasingly utilized by us.

1958 and 1959 were also the two years with the most inventions, creations, and technological innovations in China's aquaculture industry. In the past two years, we have implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and launched a vigorous mass technological innovation movement, thereby achieving significant results. For example, there are more than 2,500 mass technological innovation projects, and important technological innovations and inventions, such as the artificial incubation of silver carp and bighead carp, natural light seedling cultivation of kelp, water-vapor supercharging on fishing vessels, and rapid ice making in processing, have played an indispensable role in developing production, reducing costs, and improving labor productivity.

1958 and 1959 were also the two years with the richest experience in increasing aquatic production. In the past two years, the unit yield of marine and freshwater aquaculture has greatly increased, which is inseparable from the implementation of the "eight-character intensive farming method" in aquaculture: "Water" (improve water quality, increase water depth), "Seed" (strong seedlings), "Feed" (sufficient feed), "Density" (dense stocking, rational dense farming), "Mix" (mixed stocking of multiple varieties), "Rotation" (rotational stocking and harvesting), "Prevention" (prevention and control of diseases, insects, and pests), "Management" (specialized management). At the same time, it is also closely related to the implementation of the "five-character" measures for increasing production in fishing: "Find" (find fishing grounds), "Reform" (tool reform), "Combine" (multiple tools are used as rotation), "Protect" (protect resources), "Safety" (safe production). The experience of the past two years has proven that wherever the above measures can be comprehensively and rationally implemented in light of local conditions, higher yields can be obtained.

It can be seen that all the above achievements are victories of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and its "walking on two legs" policy in the aquaculture industry; they are victories of implementing political leadership and carrying out mass movements in the aquaculture industry; and they are also victories of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party, emancipating their minds, breaking superstitions, giving full play to their soaring enthusiasm, and creatively developing the aquaculture industry. The process of achieving these achievements is the process of gradually recognizing and mastering the objective laws of natural development and using them to transform nature. While transforming nature, we are also constantly improving ourselves.

Raising and Fishing Simultaneously is the Correct Policy for Developing Aquatic Production

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have gained a deeper understanding of the inherent regularity of the aquaculture industry and increased our awareness of extracting wealth from water by adhering to the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs, adhering to the Party's political leadership, and adhering to mass movements. Now, let's just talk about some of our preliminary experiences:

1.  Resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party and implementing the Party's mass line is the main guarantee for developing the aquaculture industry at a leaping speed. The essence of our Party's General Line for Socialist Construction is the mass line for socialist construction, which is true in industry, agriculture, and aquaculture. Without the vigorous mass movement with soaring enthusiasm, there would be no leaping speed in the development of the national economy, and there would be no high-speed development of the Great Leap Forward in aquatic production. Under almost the same conditions, whether enthusiasm is boosted or not, whether right-leaning emotions are overcome or not, will lead to two different results. For example, compared with 1957, there was not much difference in the labor force and production tools in the aquaculture industry in 1958. However, when the Party put forward the General Line for building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and when Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the idea of emancipating the mind, breaking superstitions, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and continuous revolution, the broad masses of workers and fishermen on the aquaculture front, like the industrial and agricultural masses across the country, immediately launched a production upsurge that swept across the mountains and seas, and a thriving situation emerged in the aquaculture industry. Breaking the "low-yield theory" of aquaculture production greatly increased the unit yield of fishing and aquaculture; breaking through the original boundaries of water areas that were considered suitable and unsuitable for aquaculture greatly expanded the area of aquaculture; breaking through the original boundaries of varieties that were considered suitable and unsuitable for aquaculture greatly increased the variety of production; breaking the superstition that science and technology were out of reach led to an endless stream of inventions and creations. These are not only unprecedented in the history of our country, but also difficult to compare with any year in the eight years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The total increase in production in two years exceeded the total increase in production in the previous five years by 31%, which is not only a quantitative difference, but also a qualitative leap. For example, although aquatic production continued to leap forward in the first half of 1959, the rate of development was only one-third of the annual plan compared with the same period in 1958, and two-thirds of the tasks had to be completed in the second half of the year. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the instruction to oppose right-leaning and boost enthusiasm, the broad masses of cadres and fishermen were overjoyed and enthusiastic, and immediately launched a magnificent new production upsurge of "autumn tide surpassing summer tide" and "slack season turning into peak season." The third quarter, which has always been considered the off-season for aquatic production, also turned into a big peak season, resulting in the early and over-fulfilled completion of the annual plan targets for production, procurement, supply, and export, and achieving the results of a continued Great Leap Forward. The facts of just a few months prove that relaxation makes the peak season slack, and encouragement makes the slack season prosperous. This fact has deeply educated the broad masses of cadres and fishermen, making them realize the power of the Party's General Line and the truth that man can conquer nature. It also made some people who once held the idea that the slack season can only be slack and that man cannot conquer nature admit defeat in the face of facts. Mechanical materialists believe that man can only be a slave to objective natural laws and that man is powerless to do anything about objective natural laws. Therefore, they deny man's subjective initiative and deny the truth that man can conquer nature. Dialectical materialists believe that once man recognizes and masters the objective laws of nature, man's subjective initiative can play a decisive role in objective things, and man can conquer nature.

The experience of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward tells us that in order to achieve the speed of the Great Leap Forward in the aquaculture industry, we must resolutely implement the Party's mass line. That is, in the aquaculture industry, we must both respect and master the laws of development of the aquaculture industry itself, and fully estimate the role of man's subjective initiative and mass movements; we must both rely on the workers and masses of state-owned fisheries and rely on the fishermen of the people's communes; we must both rely on and strengthen the professional aquaculture teams, and organize and lead seasonal aquaculture sideline teams whose main business is not fisheries; we must both give play to the work enthusiasm and specialized skills of engineering and technical personnel, and give play to the soaring enthusiasm and high creativity of the broad masses; we need both the financial and material support of the state, and we need to give full play to the enormous potential of the people's communes in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Only in this way can we implement the Party's General Line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the aquaculture industry, and can the aquaculture industry develop forward at a continuously leaping speed.

2.  In order to develop China's aquaculture industry at a higher speed and with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must also implement the policy of walking on two legs, simultaneously developing aquaculture and fishing, seawater and freshwater, and state-owned fisheries and commune fisheries. China's aquatic resources are extremely rich, with both vast oceans and numerous rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, and an increasing number of ponds; the potential for artificial marine and freshwater aquaculture is great, and the resources for natural fishing are also great. In order to fully utilize all aquatic resources in China's oceans and inland, we must mobilize the enthusiasm of state-owned and commune-owned, urban and rural, concentrated production areas and dispersed production areas, and professional fishermen and sideline fishermen. We must both develop marine production and freshwater production; we must both develop urban fisheries and rural fisheries; we must both focus on production in concentrated production areas and not relax production in dispersed production areas; we must both attach importance to state-owned fisheries and commune fisheries; we must both focus on fishing and aquaculture. In short, we must adopt a policy of walking on two legs in aquatic production. Neglecting any one aspect is a loss to the development of the aquaculture industry. The experience of the past two years has proven that in the process of implementing the policy of walking on two legs, aquaculture and fishing are a pair of major contradictions that play a decisive role in the development of the aquaculture industry. Because any kind of aquatic product is either obtained by fishing or by aquaculture. Fishing and aquaculture are two opposing and unified aspects of aquatic production, and the two are interdependent and mutually transformative. Only raising without fishing means that aquaculture loses its meaning; only fishing without raising means that fishing is limited by resources. Fishing for natural seedlings or parent fish transforms into aquaculture, and aquaculture transforms into fishing when it reaches maturity. Therefore, aquaculture and fishing are also mutually influencing and mutually promoting. When aquaculture develops, fishing must follow; when fishing reaches a certain level, aquaculture must make up for it. Therefore, simultaneously developing aquaculture and fishing is a correct policy for developing aquatic production at a high speed, with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the Great Leap Forward.

However, when implementing the simultaneous development of aquaculture and fishing, it must be emphasized with a certain focus with the transfer of time, place, and conditions. In areas facing the ocean and large water bodies such as rivers and lakes, fishing should generally be the main focus and aquaculture should be auxiliary; in areas with mountain ponds, reservoirs, ponds, river branches, and harbor beaches, aquaculture should generally be the main focus and fishing should be auxiliary; and in areas where both exist, aquaculture and fishing should be given equal importance. At the same time, when the market supply needs to take effect immediately, or when the object of aquaculture has grown up and reached the water-starting standard, fishing must be emphasized, otherwise production will be divorced from supply, and the means (aquaculture) will lose its purpose (fishing). However, from the perspective of the overall resource potential and development prospects, and from the perspective of developing China's aquaculture industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, aquaculture is a more promising aspect of the aquaculture industry.

Better and More Comprehensive Development of China's Aquaculture Industry

Can China's aquaculture industry continue to leap forward better and more comprehensively this year? The answer is entirely possible.

In 1960, China's aquaculture situation is even better. Under the guidance and brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the people's communes will exert their greater power. Driven by the continued leap forward in China's national economy and based on the Great Leap Forward in the aquaculture industry in the past two years, and coupled with other favorable conditions, such as the strengthening of the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over the aquaculture industry, the substantial increase in the state's support for the aquaculture industry in terms of policies and materials, and the early preparation of state-owned aquaculture enterprises and people's commune fisheries in terms of boat net tools and aquaculture seedlings, the development of aquaculture this year will achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward.

In order to better and more comprehensively develop China's aquaculture industry to meet the needs of national construction and the people's growing demand for aquatic products, we should continue to implement a series of two-legged policies such as relying on the Party, relying on the people's communes, launching mass movements, making great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution, implementing simultaneous development of aquaculture and fishing, simultaneous development of seawater and freshwater, simultaneous development of state-owned and commune-owned, and further comprehensively mobilize the positive factors of the aquaculture industry. Specifically, there are the following aspects:

First, we must vigorously develop urban fisheries and strive for rural communes to raise fish. Urban fisheries account for a large proportion of the total output. According to statistics from 39 large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing alone, the output in 1959 reached 457,000 tons, and the planned production this year is 825,000 tons. If all coastal and inland cities above the prefectural level are included, the output will account for more than half of the national total output. The development of urban fisheries has great advantages, with fertile water quality, abundant feed, strong scientific and technological forces, and modern production equipment, which can drive the development of aquaculture in the surrounding rural areas. At the same time, urban fisheries have a high commodity rate, can produce and supply locally, reduce transportation, reduce costs, and can supply more fresh and live products. Therefore, all localities should earnestly grasp it in accordance with the principle of "mainly relying on self-reliance and striving for foreign aid as a supplement." This year, they are required to fully or basically utilize urban water areas, and strive for cities south of the Huai River to achieve full or basic self-sufficiency; and cities north of the Huai River to strive to achieve full or basic self-sufficiency within two or three years. In this way, the urgent need and growing demand of the broad masses of urban people for aquatic products can be fundamentally solved. Implementing diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is one of the main characteristics of China's people's communes. The development of aquaculture by the people's communes can increase public accumulation, improve the lives of commune members, and support the further development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. All communes should organize perennial professional teams and seasonal sideline teams according to their own aquatic resource conditions to carry out aquaculture and fishing production, strive to expand the utilization area of water surfaces, implement the "eight-character" intensive farming method, improve fishing technology, improve labor productivity, and increase unit area yield. At the same time, implement the policy of simultaneously developing commodity production and self-sufficient production. A portion of small and medium-sized water areas will be decentralized to production teams to carry out semi-self-sufficient and semi-commodity production to solve the problem of commune members eating fish and increase the income of commune members. Larger or more concentrated water areas will be centrally managed by the commune in a unified way, signing production and sales contracts with the state to carry out commodity production, in order to support the needs of the people in urban areas, industrial and mining areas, and forestry and pastoral areas for aquatic products, and to strengthen the economic strength of the people's communes.

Second, strengthen marine and freshwater fishing production. In marine fishing, in addition to innovating some equipment and implementing the "five-character" measures for increasing production of "finding, reforming, combining, protecting, and safety" to increase output, institutions for telecommunications and weather forecasting should also be established and strengthened from top to bottom to ensure safe production. In the main fishing grounds, production organization and leadership during the fishing season should be strengthened to achieve unified arrangements and mutual cooperation. With the development of China's socialist industrialization and the increase in the capital accumulation of China's fisheries people's communes, the desire to realize the mechanization of China's marine fishing vessels, the nylonization of net fishing, and the telecommunications of production command is not far off.

In freshwater fishing, more effectively solving the fishing problems in large water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs has become an urgent task for current aquatic production and also a driving force for further developing freshwater aquaculture. There are still many natural lakes and "virgin seas" in China's remote provinces and regions, and aquatic resources are very rich. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation and a lack of manpower and production tools, very little fishing was carried out; in the future, necessary measures should be actively taken to develop these people's wealth as much as possible. As for the large water surfaces that have been stocked in recent years, efforts should be made to catch them. There are many advanced experiences of the masses across the country, which should be further summarized and promoted. At the same time, the use of motorized boats and sailboats and the experimental work of electric fishing should also be actively promoted. As long as the leadership in various places attaches importance to it, allocates the necessary labor force, solves the necessary tools, and launches mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, solving this problem is not difficult. If this problem is solved, the development of China's aquaculture industry, especially the aquaculture industry which has a decisive significance, will be even greater.

Third, actively carry out the construction of fishery bases in concentrated production areas, and at the same time strengthen the procurement of fishery goods and the supply of fishery materials in dispersed production areas. Concentrated fishery production areas are the largest areas of commodity production and the main source of market supply and exports for cities, industrial and mining areas, and forestry and pastoral areas. Various large, medium, and small fishery bases should be universally established in the three forms of state-owned, state-commune joint ventures, and commune management, and by combining indigenous and foreign methods, to improve the commodity production of aquatic products and further meet the people's needs for aquatic products. The construction projects should mainly focus on equipment such as cold storage, processing, storage, and transportation of fishery goods; as for adding production equipment such as boat net tools, the funds of the people's communes should be fully utilized, and the communes should be allowed to do more, so that the state's limited investment can focus on adding equipment necessary for controlling more fishery goods and other undertakings that the communes cannot currently undertake. A large-scale fishery base should be a complete system, and there should be overall planning and arrangements for production, procurement, supply and marketing, processing, transportation, scientific experimentation and research, and technical education. However, more small and medium-sized bases should be constructed from indigenous to foreign methods and by combining indigenous and foreign methods, depending on local conditions.

Although the scattered areas are wide and small, they can be combined to form more and can be changed from small to large. In order to support and promote the development of aquatic production in these areas and solve the procurement and processing of aquatic products, various fixed or mobile, professional or entrusted fishery goods procurement and fishery materials supply points and stations should be established. These points and stations are connected to the nearby fishery bases and obtain the support and guidance of the bases, so that the bases become the core and the points and stations become the satellites of the bases. All localities should appropriately establish and connect the fishery bases and fishery goods procurement points and stations, which will lay a solid foundation for the completion of the national aquatic system.

Aquatic products are important non-staple foods in people's lives, and "eating fish and eating meat" is an important symbol of people's prosperous lives. In addition to being used for food, aquatic products can also provide many important raw materials for industry, medicine, and feed or fertilizer for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other industries. Its connection with other national economies, especially with the entire agricultural front, is very close. And aquaculture is a mass production undertaking with small investment, quick results, and high returns. China has a coastline of tens of thousands of kilometers and more than 300 million mu of inland water surface, which is a major and inexhaustible source of wealth. Under the correct leadership of the Party, we have the General Line for Socialist Construction, the experience of the Great Leap Forward development speed, and the incomparably superior organizational form of the people's communes. The infinitely rich resources of nature can certainly be fully utilized by the Chinese people to serve China's socialist construction and the greater improvement of the people's lives.

    高速度地发展我国水产事业
    水产部副部长　金城
    高速度地发展我国水产事业的两年
    我国人民正在向大自然进军。我们要充分利用大自然的资源来进行社会主义建设，不仅要向平原、山区进军，而且也要向水域进军。水产战线的基本任务，就是要在党的总路线的指引下，不断跃进，高速度地发展水产生产，并把水产事业从落后的状况提高到现代化的科学技术水平，为改善人民的生活和支援国家的社会主义建设服务。
    十年来，我国水产事业在党的正确领导下，和其他国民经济部门一样，发展是十分迅速的。
    我国水产总产量由1957年的三百一十二万吨，提高到1959年的五百零二万吨，增长60．6％，平均每年递增26．8％，比1953年到1957年平均每年递增13．3％的速度增长了一倍。特别是1958年和1959年，我国水产增加的绝对量为一百九十万吨，为1953年到1957年五年增产累计一百四十五万吨的131％。毫无疑问，这是巨大的跃进。如果说，我国在第一个五年计划期间，每年平均递增13．3％的速度，已非日、美、英三个水产业最发达的资本主义国家所可比拟的（在此期间，日本每年平均递增速度为3％。美国为2．8％，英国下降），那末，1958年以来，我国水产事业每年平均递增26．8％的大跃进的速度，就更非资本主义国家所能梦想到的。
    1958年和1959年，也是我国水产领域扩展最大的两年。海、淡水养殖面积大大扩大了，许多过去认为不能养殖的水面，如海湾、海滩、湖汊、河港以及所谓死水、激流、硬水、污水等，经过水面整治和水质改良，也都能养殖了；有些从来不养鱼的山区和高原，也变成了鱼米之乡，这就大大改变了我国水产生产分布的面貌。养殖的品种也大大增加了，过去认为许多不能养殖的品种，如鲷鱼、黑鱼、对虾、螃蟹、海参、海马、海带、贻贝等品种，经过人工孵化和驯化，都进行了人工养殖，变野生为家养，从而把水产生产进一步按照我们的意志纳入计划生产之内了。捕捞方面，也开辟了新的渔场，并发展了过去所没有的鲸、海豹、海马、海龟等新品种的生产。对水域的立体利用，也向前迈进了一大步，如创造了万能网、万能钓，为捕捞上中下层鱼类提供了条件；又如各不同水层、习性鱼类的混合放养，更充分地进行了水的立体利用。在水产品的综合利用方面，两年来试制和提炼成功一百多种新产品，例如褐藻胶、鱼鳞胶、甘露醇、碘可溶性甲壳质等，大大提高了水产品的利用率和经济价值，为工业、农业、医药等提供了廉价的重要原料。随着我们对于自然界的认识的逐步深入，水域的无穷潜力将日益为我们所利用。
    1958年和1959年，也是我国水产业中发明创造和技术革新最多的两年。两年来，我们执行了土洋结合的方针，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众技术革新运动，因而取得重大的成就。例如，群众的技术革新项目达二千五百多种，重要的技术革新和发明创造，如鲢鳙鱼的人工孵化、海带的自然光育苗、渔轮上的水汽增压、加工上的快速制冰等等，对发展生产，降低成本，提高劳动生产率，都起了不可忽视的作用。
    1958年和1959年，也是水产增产经验最丰富的两年。两年来，海、淡水单位产量都有很大的提高，这和养殖方面执行“水”（改良水质、增加水深）、“种”（苗种健壮）、“饵”（饵料充足）、“密”（密放、合理密养）、“混”（多品种混合放养）、“轮”（轮放轮捕）、“防”（防治病虫敌害）、“管”（专人管理）的八字精养法分不开的。同时，也是和捕捞方面执行“找”（寻找渔场）、“改”（工具改革）、“兼”（多种工具兼作轮作）、“保”（保护资源）、“安”（安全生产）五字增产措施密切关联的。两年来的经验证明，哪里能够因地制宜、全面合理地贯彻以上措施，那里就能获得更高的产量。
    由此可见，所有上述成就，都是党的社会主义建设总路线和它的“两条腿走路”的方针在水产事业方面的胜利；是在水产事业中贯彻执行政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的胜利；同时，也是广大群众在党的领导下，解放思想、破除迷信，发挥了冲天干劲，创造性地发展水产事业的胜利。这些成就取得的过程，就是逐步认识和掌握自然发展的客观规律并用以改造自然的过程。在改造自然的同时，也不断地提高了自己。
    养殖和捕捞并举是发展水产生产的正确方针
    1958年大跃进以来，我们由于坚持党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，坚持党的政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动，因而使我们对于水产事业的内在规律性，有了进一步的认识，提高了我们从水中索取财富的自觉性。现在仅谈一下我们的一些初步体会：
    一、坚决依靠党的领导，贯彻执行党的群众路线，是以跃进的高速度发展水产事业的主要保证。我们党的社会主义建设的总路线，实质上就是社会主义建设的群众路线，这在工业上是如此，在农业上是如此，在水产事业上也是如此。没有干劲冲天的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就没有国民经济大跃进的发展速度，同时也就没有水产生产大跃进的高速度的发展。在几乎相同的条件下，鼓足了干劲和没有鼓足干劲，克服了右倾情绪和没有克服右倾情绪，就会出现两种不同的结果。例如，1958年和1957年比较，水产业中的劳动力和生产工具是没有多大的差别的，但是，当党提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线以后，当毛泽东同志提出解放思想、破除迷信，发扬敢想敢说敢干和不断革命的共产主义风格以后，水产战线上的广大职工和渔民群众同全国工农群众一样，立即掀起一个排山倒海、万马奔腾的生产高潮，出现了水产业蓬勃发展的局面。破除了水产生产的“低产论”，使捕捞和养殖的单位产量大大提高了；冲破了原先认为可养殖与不可养殖的水面的界限，使养殖水面大大扩大了；冲破了原先认为可养殖的与不可养殖的品种的界限，使生产的品种大大增加了；破除了科学技术高不可攀的迷信，使创造发明层出不穷地出现了。这些，不仅在我国历史上是空前的，就是建国以来的八年中的任何一年，也都是难于比拟的。两年增产的总和超过了前五年增产总和的31％，这不仅是量的差别，而且是质的飞跃。又如，1959年水产生产在上半年虽然继续跃进，但发展速度与1958年同期相比，产量只完成了全年计划的三分之一，而三分之二的任务要靠下半年完成。党的八届八中全会提出反右倾鼓干劲的指示以后，广大干部和渔民群众欢欣鼓舞，热情高涨，立即掀起了一个波澜壮阔的“秋汛超夏汛”、“淡季变旺季”的生产新高潮。历来被认为是水产生产淡季的第三季度，也变成了大旺季，结果使生产、收购和供应出口都提前超额完成了全年的计划指标，获得了继续大跃进的成果。短短几个月的事实证明，松劲使旺季变淡，鼓劲使淡季变旺。这个事实，深深地教育了广大干部和渔民群众，使他们认识到党的总路线的威力和人定胜天的真理。使一些曾经怀有淡季只能是淡季，人不能胜天的思想的人，也不得不在事实面前认输了。机械唯物主义者认为，人，只能做客观自然规律的奴隶，人对于客观自然规律是无能为力的，因此，否认人的主观能动性，否认人定胜天的真理。辩证唯物主义者认为，人，一经认识和掌握了客观的自然规律，人的主观能动性就能对客观事物起决定性的作用，人就能胜天。
    两年连续大跃进的经验告诉我们，要使水产业获得大跃进的速度，必须坚决贯彻执行党的群众路线。即在水产事业中，既要尊重和掌握水产业本身的发展规律，又要充分估计到人的主观能动性和群众运动的作用；既要依靠国营渔业的职工群众，又要依靠人民公社的渔民群众；既要依靠与加强水产的专业队伍，又要组织与领导季节性的、以渔业为副业的水产的副业队伍；既要发挥工程技术人员的工作热情和专门技能，又要发挥广大群众的冲天干劲和高度的创造性；既需要国家的财力和物力的支持，又需要使人民公社的人力、物力和财力的巨大潜力得以充分发挥。只有如此，才能在水产事业中贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，才能使水产事业以连续跃进的速度向前发展。
    二、为了以更高的速度和多快好省地发展我国水产事业，还必须实行养殖与捕捞、海水与淡水、国营渔业与公社渔业同时并举的两条腿走路的方针。我国水产资源极为丰富，既有广阔的海洋，又有众多的江河湖泊和日益增加的池塘水库；可以进行海、淡水人工养殖的潜力很大，可以进行天然捕捞的资源也很大。为了充分地利用我国海洋和内陆的一切水产资源，就要把国营与公社、城区与农村、集中产区与分散产区、专业渔民与副业渔民的积极性全部调动起来。既要发展海水生产，又要发展淡水生产；既要发展城区渔业，又要发展农村渔业；既要抓紧集中产区的生产，又不放松分散产区的生产；既要重视国营渔业，又要重视公社渔业；既要抓捕捞，又要抓养殖。总之，就是要在水产生产上采取两条腿走路的方针。忽视任何一个方面，对水产业的发展都是一种损失。两年来的经验证明，在执行两条腿走路方针的过程中，养殖与捕捞是对水产业的发展起决定作用的一对主要矛盾。因为，任何一种水产品不是由捕捞的方法得来，就是由养殖的方法得来。捕捞和养殖是水产生产的对立统一的两个方面，二者是相互依存、相互转化的关系。只养不捕，养殖就失去了意义；只捕不养，捕捞就受到资源的限制。捕捞到了天然苗种或亲鱼就转化为养殖，养殖到了成熟期就转化为捕捞。因此，养殖与捕捞又是相互影响、相互推动的，养殖发展了，捕捞就得跟上来；捕捞到一定的程度，养殖就得补上去。因此，养殖与捕捞同时并举，乃是一条大跃进的高速度、多快好省地发展水产生产的正确的方针。
    但是，实行养殖与捕捞并举时，必须随着时间、地点和条件的转移而有所侧重。在面临海洋和江河湖泊等大水面的地区，一般的应以捕捞为主，养殖为辅；在有山塘水库、池塘河汊、海港滩涂的地区，一般又应以养殖为主，捕捞为辅；而二者兼有的地区，则应养殖与捕捞并重。同时，当市场供应需要立即发生效果的时候，或者养殖的对象已经成长起来，达到起水标准的时候，就必须强调捕捞，否则生产就脱离了供应，手段（养殖）就失去了目的（捕捞）。但是，从整个资源潜力和发展前途来看，从多快好省地发展我国水产事业来看，养殖乃是水产业中较有发展前途的一个方面。
    更好更全面地发展我国水产事业
    今年我国水产业能否更好更全面地继续跃进呢？回答是完全可能的。
    1960年，我国的水产形势是更好了，在党的总路线的指引和光辉照耀下，人民公社将发挥它更大的威力，在我国国民经济继续跃进的带动下和两年来水产事业大跃进的基础上，以及加上其他的有利条件，如各级党委对水产事业的领导加强了，国家在政策和物质上给水产业的支援大大增加了，国营的水产企业和人民公社渔业在船网工具、养殖苗种等都及早作好了准备。因此，今年水产的发展将要实现更好更全面的跃进。
    为了更好更全面地发展我国的水产业，以适应国家建设和人民对水产品日益增长的需要，我们应该继续贯彻执行依靠党、依靠人民公社，大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新和技术革命，实行养殖和捕捞并举、海水和淡水并举、国营和公社并举等一系列两条腿走路的方针，并进一步全面地把水产业的积极因素调动起来，具体地说有以下几个方面：
    第一、要大力发展城区渔业，争取农村社社养鱼。城区渔业占总产量的比重很大，仅据北京等三十九个大中城市的统计，1959年产量即达四十五点七万吨，今年计划生产八十二点五万吨，如果将沿海和内陆专区以上城市都算起来，产量将占全国总产量的一半以上。城区渔业的发展有很大的优越性，水质肥沃，饲料充足，科学技术力量强和现代化生产设备多，可以带动周围农村水产的发展。同时，城区渔业商品率高，可以就地生产，就地供应，减少运输，降低成本，又可以供应更多的鲜活产品。因此，各地应当根据“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，认真地抓起来，要求今年将城区水面全部地或基本地利用起来，争取淮河以南城市做到全部自给或基本自给；淮河以北城市争取在二、三年内做到全部自给或基本自给。这样，就可以把广大城市人民迫切需要和日益增长的水产品供应问题，获得根本的解决。实行农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营，是我国人民公社的主要特点之一。人民公社发展水产业可以增加公共积累，改善社员生活，支援农林牧副业的进一步发展。各公社应该根据自己的水产资源情况，组织常年性的专业队伍和季节性的副业队伍，进行水产的养殖和捕捞生产，努力扩大水面的利用面积，贯彻执行“八字”精养法，改进捕捞技术，提高劳动生产率，提高单位面积产量。同时，贯彻执行商品性生产和自给性生产同时并举的方针。将一部分中小型水面下放到生产队，进行半自给性半商品性的生产，解决社员吃鱼问题和增加社员的收入。较大的或较集中的水面，则由公社集中统一经营，与国家订立产销合同，进行商品性的生产，以支援城市、工矿、林牧区人民对水产品的需要，并壮大人民公社的经济力量。
    第二、加强海、淡水的捕捞生产。在海洋捕捞方面，除革新一部分装备，实行“找、改、兼、保、安”五字增产措施，以提高产量外，还应当从上到下建立和加强电讯及气象预报的机构，以便保证安全生产。在主要渔场要加强渔汛期的生产组织与领导，以达到统一安排和相互协作的目的。随着我国社会主义工业化的发展，随着我国渔业人民公社资金积累的增加，实现我国海洋捕捞渔船机械化、网钓尼龙化、生产指挥电讯化的愿望，为期已经不远了。
    在淡水捕捞方面，更有效地解决江河湖泊和水库等大水面的捕捞问题，已经成为当前水产生产的急务，同时也是进一步开展淡水养殖业的动力。我国边远省区还有不少的天然湖、“处女海”，水产资源十分丰富。过去由于交通不便，人力和生产工具缺乏，捕捞的很少；今后应该积极采取必要的措施，将这些人民的财富尽可能地开发起来。至于几年来已经进行了放养的大水面，更应该千方百计地捕捞起来。全国各地群众的先进经验很多，应该进一步总结和推广。同时，机轮、机帆船的运用和电力捕鱼等试验工作也应该积极推行。只要各地领导上重视，调配必要的劳动力，解决必要的工具，开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，解决这个问题并不困难。这个问题解决了，我国水产事业的发展，特别是有着决定意义的养殖业，将会得到更大的发展。
    第三、积极进行集中产区的渔业基地建设，同时加强分散产区的渔货收购和渔需物资的供应。集中的渔产区是商品性生产最大的地区，是城市、工矿、林牧区的市场供应和出口的主要来源，应该采取国营、国家和公社联营、公社经营的三种形式和土洋结合的办法，普遍建立各种大中小型的渔业基地，提高水产品的商品生产，进一步满足人民对水产品的需要。建设的项目，应以渔货的冷藏、加工、储运等设备为主；至于增添船网工具等生产设备，应该充分利用人民公社的资金，让公社多办，使国家有限的投资着重增置那些为了掌握更多的渔货所必需的设备和其他非公社目前所能举办的事业。一个大型的渔业基地，应该是一个完整的体系，从生产、收购、供销、加工、运输、科学试验研究，以及技术教育等，都应该有总体的规划和安排。但是，更多的中小型基地，则应因地制宜地，采取由土到洋、土洋结合的办法，来进行建设。
    较分散的地区，虽然面广量小，但是集少可以成多，由小可以变大。为了支持和促进这些地区的水产生产的发展，解决水产品的收购和加工处理，应该设立各种固定的或流动的、专业的或委托的渔货收购和渔需物资供应的点和站。这些点和站，与邻近的渔业基地联系起来，取得基地的支援和指导，使基地成为核心，点、站成为基地的卫星。各地都把渔业基地和渔货收购点、站适当地建立与联系起来，这就为全国水产体系的建成打下了坚实的基础。
    水产品是人民生活中重要的副食品，“吃鱼吃肉”是人民生活富裕的一个重要标志。水产品除了食用以外，还可提供许多重要的工业、医药的原料和农林牧等业的饲料或肥料，它和其他国民经济特别是和整个农业战线的联系是十分密切的。而水产业又是一种投资小、收效快、收益大的群众性的生产事业。我国有一万数千公里的海岸线，三亿亩以上的内陆水面，真是一种取之不尽、用之不竭的重大富源。在党的正确领导下，我们有了社会主义建设总路线，大跃进发展速度的经验，又有了人民公社这样无比优越的组织形式，大自然无限丰富的资源一定可以为我国人民所充分利用，为我国社会主义建设和人民生活的更大改善而服务。
