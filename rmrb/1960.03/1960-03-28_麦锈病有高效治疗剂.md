Para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid can be absorbed by plants and can inhibit the development of rust fungi that have invaded the plant. The control effect on stripe rust is 80%; the control effect on leaf rust and stem rust is above 90%.

    This newspaper reports: Currently, China has a highly effective rust-killing agent for the prevention and treatment of wheat rust disease - para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid. This rust-killing therapeutic agent is different from general protective agents in that it can be absorbed by plants and is absorbed relatively quickly. Therefore, it is not afraid of being washed away by rain after spraying, and it can inhibit the development of rust fungi that have already invaded the plant. In 1959, field trials in winter wheat areas and spring wheat areas such as Fujian, Anhui, Henan, and Jilin proved that para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid has a very significant control effect on the three types of wheat rust. The control effect on stripe rust is 80%, and the control effect on leaf rust and stem rust is above 90%, while the effect of the commonly used lime sulfur mixture at Baume 0.5 degrees is only about 50%.

    The method of using para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is simple. It can be prepared into an aqueous solution and sprayed evenly on the plants; the concentration used is 0.4%, that is, every four grams of para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is dissolved in two *shi jin* of water. If it dissolves slowly in cold water, it can be dissolved in a small amount of warm water or boiling water first, and then diluted with cold water. When using, pay attention to whether the agent is completely dissolved, otherwise it will cause waste and the control effect will be affected to a certain extent. When the prevalence rate of rust disease reaches 0.1%-1%, spraying can be started. Apply 200 to 250 *jin* of aqueous solution per *mu* each time, for a total of two to three sprays, once every ten days to half a month, to obtain a good control effect.

    The chemical structure of para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is H2N-?-So3H. Its refined product is a white crystal, and the crude product is often grayish-white. The crude product of para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, a by-product of the manufacture of sulfa drugs, is a pale red flaky crystal. It is usually synthesized directly from sulfuric acid and aniline, and a large amount is also produced as a by-product when producing sulfa drugs, so pharmaceutical factories or chemical plants can organize large-scale recovery. International literature has mentioned that para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid has a therapeutic effect on individual rust diseases, but no field trials have been conducted, so it has not been introduced and applied in production practice.

    麦锈病有高效治疗剂
    对氨基苯磺酸能被植株内吸，可以抑制侵入植株体内的锈菌发育。对条锈防治效果为80％；对叶锈和秆锈防治效果为90％以上。
    本报讯  目前，我国防治小麦锈病有了一种高效灭锈剂——对氨基苯磺酸。这种灭锈治疗剂和一般保护药剂不同，它能被植株内吸，并且吸入的速度较快。因此喷用以后，不怕雨水冲洗，可以抑制已经侵入植株体内的锈病菌的发育。1959年，在福建、安徽、河南、吉林等冬麦区和春麦区进行大田试验证明：对氨基苯磺酸对三种小麦锈病的防治效果甚为显著。对条锈病的防治效果为80％，对叶锈病和秆锈病的防治效果为90％以上，而通常使用的波美0．5度石硫合剂的效果只有50％左右。
    对氨基苯磺酸的使用方法简便，将它配制成水溶液，均匀喷射在植株上即可；使用浓度为0．4％，即每四克对氨基苯磺酸溶解于二市斤水中。如果用冷水溶解较慢时，可先用少量温水或开水溶解后再以冷水稀释。使用时要注意药剂是否溶尽，否则既会造成浪费，防治效果也受一定影响。当锈病发生的普遍率达到0．1％—1％时即可开始喷射，每亩每次喷施二百至二百五十斤水溶液，共喷二至三次，每隔十天到半月喷射一次，可获得良好的防治效果。
  对氨基苯磺酸的化学结构为H2N-?-So3H。它的精制品为白色结晶，粗制品常呈灰白色，制造磺胺类药物副产的对氨基苯磺酸的粗制品，呈淡红色的片状结晶。通常以硫酸和苯胺直接合成，生产磺胺药物时也有大量副产，因此制药厂或化工厂可以大量组织回收。国际文献上曾提及对氨基苯磺酸对个别锈病有治疗效果，但未进行田间试验，因此在生产实践上未介绍应用。
