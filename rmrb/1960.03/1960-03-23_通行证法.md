    "Pass Laws"
    The "Pass Laws" are the most harmful of South Africa's seventy-odd racial discrimination laws. This law stipulates that every African over the age of sixteen must carry twenty-seven kinds of documents with them, and those whose documents are incomplete will be sent to white farms for forced labor. In recent years, the number of Africans sentenced to imprisonment under the "Pass Laws" and related laws has been increasing. In 1950, it was 217,300, and in 1956-1957, it increased to more than 643,000.
    As written in South Africa's "Drum" magazine: "The farmers hope to obtain laborers without spending a penny, and providing such labor has indeed become the main purpose of the pass system. The implementation of this system has turned the police and government officials into recruiters of cheap labor." In addition, it is also one of the main means for the South African government to maintain its reign of terror.
    The South African people, who are constantly engaged in heroic struggles against racial discrimination, have been fighting for the abolition of the "Pass Laws" for more than ten years. In 1952, the African National Congress of South Africa launched the "Defiance of Unjust Laws" campaign, demanding the abolition of discriminatory laws such as the "Pass Laws." On August 9, 1956, 20,000 women from several cities in South Africa gathered in Pretoria to demonstrate against the "Pass Laws." Since then, every year on August 9th, South African women have been fighting against the "Pass Laws" in various ways. In May 1959, the African National Congress of South Africa launched the anti-"Pass Laws" movement, and at its 47th annual meeting in December, it was decided to push the movement to a new climax this year. The resolution also stipulated that March 31st would be the African people's "Day Against Pass Laws." Fearing the increasingly strong resistance of the African people, the South African authorities have adopted bloody suppression methods, but this can only arouse greater anger among the South African people and strengthen their determination to fight.

### “通行证法”

    “通行证法”
    “通行证法”是南非七十余项种族歧视法令中为害最深的一项法令。这项法令规定：每一个年满十六岁的非洲人必须随身带着二十七种证件，证件不齐就要送到白人农场去强迫劳动。几年来，在“通行证法”和有关法律下被判处徒刑的非洲人数一直在增加，1950年是二十一万七千三百人，1956—1957年竟增加到六十四万三千多人。
    正如南非的“鼓声”月刊所写的：“农场主希望不花一文地获得劳工，提供这样的劳动力确乎已经成为通行证制度的主要目的。这种制度的实施已经把警察和政府官员变成廉价劳工的强募队。”此外，它也是南非政府维持恐怖统治的主要手段之一。
    为反对种族歧视而不断进行英勇斗争的南非人民，十多年来一直为取消“通行证法”而斗争。南非非洲人国民大会在1952年发动了“蔑视不公正法令”运动，要求取消“通行证法”等歧视性法令。1956年8月9日，南非几个城市的二万名妇女集合在比勒陀利亚市举行反“通行证法”示威。此后，每年8月9日南非妇女就以各种方式进行反对“通行证法”的斗争。1959年5月，南非非洲人国民大会发动了反“通行证法”运动，12月举行第四十七届年会上又决定要在今年把运动推向新的高潮，决议还规定3月31日为非洲人“反对通行证日”。由于害怕非洲人民越来越强烈的反抗，南非当局就采取了血腥镇压手段，但是，这只能激起南非人民更大的愤怒，加强南非人民的斗争决心。
