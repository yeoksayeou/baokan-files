Oh Hyun-joo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, said in his speech that the participation of young students in the construction of Pyongyang contributes to the construction of the democratic capital of the socialist motherland, and on the other hand, consolidates the knowledge they have learned on the construction site, and cultivates a persevering revolutionary spirit and communist qualities.
