　　Workers, Peasants, and Merchants Unite to Fight the Spring Drought
　　Henan's Industrial Sector Actively Rushes to Manufacture and Repair Irrigation and Drainage Machinery
　　Commercial Employees in Tianjin Counties Swiftly Transfer Drought-Resistant Materials
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou - Workers on the industrial front in Henan Province are vigorously manufacturing irrigation and drainage machinery and power equipment to support agriculture in combating drought and carrying out spring plowing.

    By February 20th, the province's agricultural machinery industry sector had produced 582 boiler-turbine sets, diesel engines, and gas engines with a total of over 12,000 horsepower, 518 water pumps, 5,656 waterwheels, and 529 rocket drills for well-drilling. This batch of well-drilling and irrigation equipment has been shipped to rural areas. Recently, the Provincial Industrial Department decided to provide 5,000 tons of cement, 1,000 tons of steel, and 5,000 cubic meters of timber and other water conservancy building materials to meet the needs of drought resistance in rural areas.

    The Luoyang First Tractor Factory, the Kaifeng Combine Harvester Manufacturing Factory, the Zhengzhou Heavy Machinery Factory, and other factories have organized forces to rush to manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery in addition to completing their production plans. Changge County organized more than 300 field mobile service teams to ensure that the "three factories" (iron, wood, and repair factories) reached the "ten-thousand-mu high-yield area," and the "three craftsmen" (iron, wood, and repair craftsmen) reached the fields, manufacturing various irrigation and well-drilling tools on the spot. They have now manufactured 331 rocket drills for well-drilling, supporting farmers in drilling 1,066 machine wells. They have also ensured that irrigation and drainage machinery is repaired as soon as it breaks down, with minor repairs done on-site and major repairs done within the area, increasing the county's daily spring irrigation progress from 42,000 mu to 61,000 mu. The Yongcheng County Machinery Factory workers manufactured a turbine waterwheel that can be operated by two people and irrigate 40 mu of wheat per day. Farmers praised it, saying, "Spring rain is as precious as oil, but we don't have to worry if it doesn't fall. With the new waterwheel, clear water flows everywhere."

    This newspaper reports that commercial employees in Tianjin's counties are making every effort to support the fight against drought.

    To organize the supply of drought-resistant materials, commercial departments have proactively contacted industrial departments and have signed 831 production and processing contracts for drought-resistant tools, totaling more than 3 million pieces. Commercial departments at all levels have also assisted communes and production teams in producing drought-resistant tools for their own use. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties, they quickly prepared 125,018 waterwheels, more than 20,000 water dragons, and 160,000 water buckets.

    After organizing the drought-resistant materials, the commercial departments in each county immediately transported them to the front lines of drought resistance. In addition to organizing professional supply teams, each county also established mobile delivery groups and field sales points, using 2,900 carts, bicycles, and wheelbarrows, setting off a high tide of delivering goods to teams, to fields, and to construction sites.

    工农商同心协力战春旱
    河南省工业部门积极赶制和修配排灌机械
    天津各县商业职工雷厉风行赶调抗旱物资
    据新华社郑州电　河南省工业战线的职工，正在大造排灌机械和动力设备，支援农业抗旱春耕。
    到2月20日为止，全省农业机械工业部门已经生产锅驼机、柴油机、煤气机五百八十二台共一万二千多马力，水泵五百一十八台，水车五千六百五十六部，打井火箭锥五百二十九部，这批打井、排灌设备已陆续运往农村。最近，省工业部门又决定提供五千吨水泥，一千吨钢材和五千立方米木材等水利建筑材料，适应农村抗旱需要。
    洛阳第一拖拉机厂，开封联合收割机制造厂、郑州重型机械厂等工厂，在完成生产计划以外，都组织力量赶制排灌机械。长葛县组织了三百多个田间流动服务队，做到三厂（铁、木、修配厂）到方（万亩丰产方），三匠（铁、木、修理匠）到田，就地制造各种浇灌和打井工具，现在已经制造打井火箭锥三百三十一部，支援农民打好机井一千零六十六眼，还作到了排灌机具随坏随修，小修不离井，大修不出方，使全县每天的春浇进度由四万二千亩提高到六万一千亩。永城县机械厂职工制造出一种汽轮水车，两个人操作，一天能浇麦四十亩。农民们赞扬说：“春雨贵似油，不下也不愁，有了新水车，清水遍地流”。
    本报讯　天津市各县商业部门职工全力支援抗旱斗争。
    为了组织抗旱物资货源，商业部门主动地同工业部门联系，已经签订了抗旱工具生产加工合同八百三十一份，达三百多万件。各级商业部门还协助各公社、生产队自产自用抗旱工具。仅据十个县的不完全统计，很快就备齐了水车十二万五千零一十八辆，水龙二万多架，水斗十六万个。
    各县商业部门组织到抗旱物资以后，马上向抗旱前线调运。各县除了组织专业供应大军以外，还建立了流动送货组和田间售货点，利用大车、自行车、小推车两千九百辆，掀起了送货到队、到方田、到工地的高潮。
