Changchun, March 16 (report from this newspaper) In the technical innovation and technological revolution movement, the Changchun Automotive Parts Factory is carrying out a comprehensive reform of department work, greatly improving the efficiency of department work and the level of enterprise management, promoting the in-depth development of the technological revolution movement, and ensuring continuous leap-forward in production.

Although the factory's department management level has greatly improved in recent years, some aspects of department work still cannot keep up with the needs of production development due to the continuous leap-forward in production. Especially after the level of mechanization and automation has been generally improved, the incompatibility of design, scheduling, reporting, and material supply has become even more prominent. Taking the Technology Department as an example, the design capacity of molds is only about fifty sets per month, while the production capacity has increased from forty sets to eighty to ninety sets per month. Although the technical staff is buried in their desks all day long, and sometimes work late into the night, they still cannot change the passive situation of the workshops urging for drawings and machines waiting for drawings. As for helping workers solve problems encountered in technical innovations, they are even more unable to attend to it.

In response to this situation, the factory's Party committee promptly put forward the slogan "Comprehensive reform of department management work, closely following the great renewal of production technology" to the department. Subsequently, a mass movement for the comprehensive reform of department management operations was launched throughout the factory.

In the comprehensive reform of department work, the factory adopted the practice of concentrating efforts to make key breakthroughs in the weak links of management work, which has achieved good results. For example, the Technology Department, based on the situation that the mold design capacity could not meet the needs of production, launched a debate, with everyone offering suggestions and thinking of solutions. As a result, they created a set of "parallel, standard, and serialized" design methods, breaking the original routine of product design, process preparation, and process equipment design being carried out sequentially by three groups. This simplified the original eight procedures of design, review, etc., into one, shortening the design cycle by two-thirds. Standardized design drawings were adopted in mold design, so that all molds were divided into ten series and seventeen structures according to processes such as punching, rolling, and drawing to create standard designs. In this way, the design efficiency increased by thirty to forty times at once.

In the comprehensive reform of production management work, the factory's business departments also jointly reformed scheduling, planning, production statistics, and other work with workshops and groups. They implemented a system of production scheduling charts and mass production statistics, which not only enabled department work to serve production better but also strongly promoted the development of production and technological innovation movements.

The departments, workshops, and groups also established product, output, and variety balance charts, production preparation instruction charts, and production key lists to guide production. These charts changed the previous scheduling method of schedulers relying only on two legs and a mouth, enabling the production of multiple varieties and complex processes to be closely coordinated rhythmically. Problems in production were quickly resolved, ensuring that the production balance rate increased from 60% to more than 90%, and ensuring the comprehensive overfulfillment of variety, output, and output value plans.

The comprehensive reform of department work has enabled the factory's "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system to be better implemented. Department personnel have freed themselves from tedious affairs and have more time to go deep into the workshops to study production, participate in production, and carry out technical innovations together with the workers.

    改进设计方法　提高管理水平　适应革新形势
    长春汽车配件厂全面改革科室工作
    本报长春16日电　长春汽车配件厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，进行科室工作的全面大改革，大大提高了科室工作的效率和企业管理的水平，促进了技术革命运动深入发展，并保证了生产持续跃进。
    这个厂的科室管理水平，几年来虽然有了很大的提高，但是由于生产不断跃进，科室工作的某些环节仍然跟不上生产发展的需要。特别是在机械化、自动化的水平普遍提高以后，设计、调度、表报、材料供应等方面不相适应的情况就更为突出。以技术科为例，设计模具的能力每月只有五十套左右，而生产能力却已由每月四十套提高到八十至九十套。技术人员虽然终日埋头案桌，有时忙到深夜，还是改变不了车间催图纸、机器等图纸的被动局面。至于帮助工人解决一些技术革新中遇到的问题，更是无暇顾及了。
    工厂党委针对这一情况，及时向科室部门提出了“科室管理工作大改革，紧紧跟上生产技术大翻新”的口号。接着，一个全面改革科室管理业务的群众运动，便在全厂开展起来了。
    在全面改革科室工作中，这个厂对管理工作的薄弱环节，采取了集中力量重点突破的做法，收到了良好的效果。如技术科根据模具设计能力不能满足生产需要的情况，展开了鸣放辩论，人人提建议、个个想办法，结果创造了一套“平行、标准、系列化”的设计方法，打破了原来产品设计、工艺编制、工艺装备设计三个组依次设计的常规，使原来的设计、审核等八道程序简化为一道，设计周期缩短了三分之二。在模具设计上采用了标准化设计图纸，使全部模具按冲孔、压延、拉形等工序分为十个系列，十七种结构做出标准设计。这样，设计效率一下就提高了三十至四十倍。
    在生产管理工作全面改革中，这个厂的业务科室，还和车间、小组共同改革了调度工作、计划编制、生产统计等工作。实行了生产调度图表化，生产统计群众化等制度，使科室工作不仅为生产服务得更好，而且有力地促进了生产和技术革新运动的发展。
    各科室、车间、小组还建立了产品、产量、品种均衡图表，生产准备指示图表，生产关键一览表等用来指挥生产。这些图表改变了过去调度员只凭两条腿一张嘴的调度方法，使多品种和复杂工序的生产得到了有节奏的紧密配合，生产中出现的问题很快就获得了解决，并保证生产均衡率由60％提高到90％以上，保证了品种、产量、产值计划的全面超额完成。
    科室工作的全面改革，使这个厂的“两参、一改、三结合”的制度得到了更好的贯彻。科室人员摆脱了繁琐的事务，有更多时间深入车间研究生产，参加生产，和工人一起大搞技术革新。
