    Guided by High Yield, with "Early" as the Center of Action
    Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi Meticulously Prepare for Cotton Sowing
    Henan Focuses on Combating Drought and Preserving Soil Moisture
    (Our Newspaper Zhengzhou, March 19th) People's communes in cotton-producing areas of Henan Province are actively and comprehensively carrying out cotton sowing preparations.
    Henan Province has experienced very little rain and snow this past winter and spring. At the start of the spring plowing season, the entire province launched a campaign of large-scale leveling and tilling of cotton fields, along with intensive spring irrigation and drought prevention to preserve soil moisture. In the Xinxiang area's Yellow River irrigation zone, counties and people's communes adopted a unified leadership approach, irrigating in staggered phases, batches, and sections to fully utilize river water. Mountainous and hilly areas built numerous pumping stations to draw water uphill, using basins and jars for point irrigation to accumulate sufficient subsoil moisture. While irrigating wheat for its greening stage, the area also irrigated 1.52 million mu of cotton fields, combining irrigation with harrowing to conserve moisture. The soil moisture content of over 3 million mu of irrigated cotton fields is around 20%. Counties and cities such as Anyang, Huojia, and Xinxiang divided labor into two shifts, irrigating wheat during the day and cotton fields at night, resolving the conflict between grain and cotton for water. Currently, 98% of Henan's cotton fields have undergone harrowing to preserve moisture and level the land in the spring, following winter plowing and harrowing, and the application of 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu on 80% of the area. In conjunction with land leveling, over 60% of the cotton fields have been transformed into garden-like plots.
    The broad masses of Henan have deeply realized from years of cotton yield increase experience that vigorously developing high-yield plots to drive large fields is a crucial key to achieving overall high yields. The area of high-yield cotton plots province-wide will expand from 30% last year to over 50% this year. On the basis of summarizing and promoting yield-increasing experiences, the Luoyang area has established 1,188,800 mu of high-yield plots this year, nearly doubling the 1959 figure, and launched a million-mu campaign for 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu throughout the area. After studying the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, farmers in the Xinyang area overcame the conservative thinking that the area was unsuitable for cotton due to high rainfall, and that cotton yields were low and inferior to rice cultivation, and comprehensively arranged the acreage for grain and cotton crops. The Xinxiang area not only established large-area high-yield plots in the plains but also established high-yield slopes, ridges, and gullies in the mountainous and hilly areas.
    This year, the promotion of cotton seedling cultivation and transplanting in the province is a prominent feature of cotton sowing preparations. Last year, various localities conducted key experiments in seedling cultivation and transplanting, with significant yield increases. This year, based on summarizing last year's yield increase experience, various localities are actively promoting soil-heated greenhouse square-grid seedling cultivation and nutrient pot heated-bed seedling cultivation methods. The Kaifeng area has invested 179,800 laborers in seedling activities, having cultivated seedlings on over 60,000 mu, which can be transplanted to 1.2 million mu of large fields, accounting for 40% of the planned 3 million mu of cotton sowing.
    Throughout the province, spring plowing and production also included universal cotton seed inspection, grain selection, sunning, germination testing, and improved seed allocation, tool maintenance, technical personnel training, and other tasks to ensure that all cotton fields are sown adequately and well in a timely manner.
    Shandong Vigorously Develops High-Yield Plots
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 18th. Shandong Province has made comprehensive, meticulous, and solid preparations for this year's cotton sowing. Currently, the more than 11 million mu of cotton fields planned for sowing province-wide have generally undergone plowing. The 5 million mu of cotton fields in the nine counties with high cotton production, such as Linqing, Gaotang, Guanxian, and Gaomi, have generally been harrowed twice, and the large-area high-yield plots have been harrowed five or six times or more. 50% of the cotton fields in various localities have been combined with deep plowing and manure application. The 4 million mu of cotton fields in the Liaocheng area have had 89% of base fertilizer applied, generally at a rate of 5,000 jin or more. In order to eliminate cotton pests, various localities have continuously carried out "sweeping campaigns" focused on eliminating cotton aphids and pink bollworms under the slogan of "eliminate in winter, sweep away residue in spring, and ensure that pests do not enter the fields." Cotton branches and leaves and pest breeding grounds have been treated to thoroughly destroy the source of pests.
    The province's cotton seeds have also been fully prepared. According to statistics from the Liaocheng and Zibo areas, the seeds selected by grain have accounted for more than 80% of all cotton seeds. Linqing, Gaotang, Xiajina, Guanxian and other places have completed all the grain selection and made germination tests. The irrigated area of the province has reached 4.5 million mu, an increase of 80% over the same period last year.
    Vigorously developing large-area high-yield plots is another feature of Shandong's cotton production this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 10,000-mu plots, 1,000-mu plots, and 100-mu plots have been made in various places, and the area of high-yield plots has reached more than 5 million mu, accounting for 50% of the total area. These large-area high-yield plots are all small squares connected to large squares, and large squares cover small squares. The ridges are very neat, and irrigation canals have also been opened.
    This year, Shandong has also made good technical preparations for sowing cotton. According to preliminary statistics, the province has trained more than 800,000 technicians, basically achieving the requirement of one technician per ten mu and one local expert per hundred mu. In order to vigorously promote technological innovation and scientific research, some areas have also adopted the method of building stations and fields in high-yield plots to strengthen technical research.
    Shanxi's Plans Implemented Down to the Team Level
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 18th. As the cotton sowing season approaches, people's communes in cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province are dispatching more than one million commune members to step up sowing preparations. On the main roads and small roads leading to cotton fields, vehicles and people transporting fertilizer are in an endless stream. Many commune members are harrowing to preserve moisture and irrigating day and night in cotton fields to prevent and combat drought. Female commune members are conducting a final inspection of cotton seeds and intensifying sunning and careful selection.
    In order to ensure good cotton planting, many counties and communes have held symposiums of cotton planting experts and technicians to summarize and promote the experience of high cotton yields in various places. The province has trained more than 130,000 backbone cotton planting technicians. Relying on these forces, cotton planting techniques have also been taught to 1.3 million commune members.
    This year, Shanxi's planned cotton planting area will be expanded by more than 2% compared with last year's harvested area. At present, the planting plan has been fully implemented to the team and the land. Cotton fields in various places have been plowed once, of which 67% have been deep ploughed seven inches or more. The amount of fertilizer prepared in various places is about 15% more than last year on average per mu, of which high-quality fertilizer accounts for 60%. With the development of large-scale water conservancy movement, irrigated cotton fields have accounted for 47% of the total cotton field area, more than doubling last year. Cotton seeds in various cotton-producing areas have also been fully prepared. This year, the planting area of ​​fine varieties can reach 96%.
    According to the policy of combining more planting with more harvesting and high yield with more harvesting, various places are vigorously developing high-yield cotton plots. More than 3,000 large-area high-yield cotton plots of 100 mu, 1,000 mu, and 10,000 mu have been established throughout the province, covering more than 35% of the total cotton field area. Most of these high-yield plots have contiguous land, flat ground, straight ridges, accessible roads, and a network of canals. The seventeen major cotton-producing counties in the province have arranged high-yield plots in good locations with fertile soil and water conservancy conditions, and high standards have been achieved in fertilizer, plowing, and seed preparation.

    河南山东山西棉花播种准备工作细致
    河南抓抗旱保墒
    本报郑州19日电　河南省产棉区人民公社，积极地全面进行棉花播种准备工作。
    河南省去冬今春雨雪很少，春耕开始时全省就开展了大平大整棉田，大抓春灌和防旱保墒工作。新乡地区引黄灌溉区各县和人民公社，采取统一领导，分期分批分段轮流浇水的办法，充分利用河水灌田。山区丘陵区大建抽水站，引水上山，出动盆盆罐罐点浇，蓄足底墒。全区在浇好小麦返青水的同时，春灌棉田一百五十二万亩，结合春灌进行了耙耱保墒，已浇水的三百余万亩棉田，土壤含水量20％左右。安阳、获嘉、新乡等县、市，把劳力分成两班，日浇小麦，夜灌棉田，解决了粮棉争水矛盾。目前，河南省98％的棉田，在冬翻冬耙和80％的面积亩施底肥万斤的基础上，春季又普遍进行了耙耱保墒，平整土地；结合土地平整，已有60％以上的棉田实现了园田化。
    河南省广大群众从历年棉花增产的经验中，深刻体会到大搞丰产方，以丰产方带动大田，是获得全面高产的重要关键。全省棉花丰产方面积将由去年30％，扩大到50％以上。洛阳专区在总结推广增产经验的基础上，今年建立了一百一十八万八千亩丰产方，比1959年扩大将近两倍，并在全区展开了百万亩双百斤皮棉丰产运动。信阳专区农民通过学习以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针后，克服了过去认为雨量大，不适宜种棉花；棉花产量低，不如种水稻的保守思想，全面安排了粮棉作物面积。新乡专区不仅在平原地区建立了大面积丰产方，还在山岗丘陵区建立了丰产坡、丰产岭、丰产沟。
    今年这个省推行棉花育苗移栽，是棉花播种准备工作的一个突出特点。去年，各地育苗移栽都进行了重点试验，增产效果显著。今年各地在总结去年增产经验的基础上，积极推行土温室方格育苗和营养钵火炕育苗法。开封专区投入育苗活动的劳力达十七万九千八百个，已育苗六万余亩，可移栽大田一百二十万亩，占计划播种棉花三百万亩的40％。
    全省各地在春耕生产中，还普遍进行了棉种检查、粒选、翻晒、发芽试验和良种调剂，工具检修，技术人员培训等等工作，以保证全部棉田适时种足种好。
    山东大搞丰产方
    新华社济南18日电　山东省今年棉花播种的准备工作做得全面细致踏实。目前，全省计划播种的一千一百多万亩棉田已普遍经过耕翻，盛产棉花的临清、高唐、冠县、高密等九个县的五百万亩棉田一般都耙耢了两遍，大面积丰产方都耙耢了五、六遍以上。各地结合深翻施粪的棉田达50％。聊城专区的四百万亩棉田，已有89％施了底粪，施肥量一般在五千斤以上。为了消灭棉花虫害，各地在“冬消灭，春扫残，保证虫害不进田”的口号下，连续开展了以灭除棉蚜、红铃虫为主的“扫荡战”。处理了棉花枝叶和虫害孳生地，彻底摧毁了虫源。
    全省棉田的种子也已经备足。据聊城、淄博两专区的统计，目前粒选的种子已占全部棉种的80％以上。临清、高唐、夏津、冠县等地已全部粒选完毕，并且作了发芽试验。全省灌溉面积已达四百五十万亩，比去年同期增加80％。
    大搞大面积丰产方，是今年山东棉花生产的又一特点。据不完全统计，各地已制成万亩方、千亩方、百亩方八千多个，丰产方面积达五百多万亩，占总面积的50％。这些大面积丰产方都是小方连大方，大方套小方，畦埂很整齐，并且还都开辟了灌溉渠道。
    今年山东播种棉花的技术准备工作也作得好。据初步统计，目前全省已经训练出八十多万名技术员，基本上达到了十亩有一个技术员，百亩一个土专家的要求。为了大闹技术革新和科学研究工作，有的地区还采取在丰产方内建站、建场的办法，加强技术研究。
    山西计划落实到队
    新华社太原18日电　棉花播种季节即将到来，山西各产棉区人民公社出动一百多万社员加紧进行播种准备工作。在通往棉田的大路小路上，运送肥料的车辆、人群络绎不绝；很多社员在棉田中耙耱保墒和日夜不停地灌溉，进行防旱抗旱；女社员正对棉籽做最后一次的检查，并且加紧翻晒和精选。
    为了确保种好棉花，许多县、社都召开了种棉能手技术座谈会，总结推广各地棉花丰产经验。全省共训练了十三万多名植棉技术骨干，依靠这些力量，还向一百三十万社员传授了植棉技术。
    今年山西棉花计划种植面积比去年收获面积扩大2％以上。目前种植计划已经全部落实到队到地。各地棉田都已翻耕了一遍，其中67％深耕七寸以上。各地准备的肥料，平均每亩占有量比去年增加15％左右，其中优质肥料占60％。随着大规模水利运动的开展，水地棉田已占棉田总面积47％，比去年增加一倍多。各棉区棉籽也已全部备妥，今年优良品种播种面积可达96％。
    根据多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，各地都大搞棉花丰产方。全省已经建立的棉花百亩、千亩、万亩大面积丰产方共达三千多个，面积占棉田总面积35％以上。这些丰产方，大部分土地连片，地平埂直，道路通达、渠道成网。全省十七个主要产棉县，都把丰产方安排在土质肥沃、有水利条件的好地点，肥料、耕翻、种籽准备等样样都实现了高标准。
