    Contracting by Region, Contracting by Task, Contracting to the End
    Jilin City Factories Fully Support Agriculture
    Changchun Dispatch from Our Newspaper, March 9th: Under the slogans of "Every Factory Provides Support, Every Team Makes a Contribution, Everyone Exerts Effort," the industrial and mining enterprises and the masses of workers in Jilin City have vigorously supported agriculture. In the past two months, Jilin City's industrial sector has supported the Jilin region (including the suburbs of Jilin City and the five counties under its jurisdiction: Panshi, Huadian, Jiaohe, Yongji, and Shulan) with 252 items of various types, totaling 70,412 pieces, including crushers, chaff cutters, machine tools, electric motors, and water pumps. In order to accelerate agricultural technical transformation and ensure the sustained leap forward in agricultural production, factories, mines, and enterprises in Jilin City are actively producing urgently needed agricultural machinery. At the same time, they are organizing service teams to support agriculture, help develop county and commune industries, repair and manufacture agricultural implement parts for the communes, or train technical personnel for the counties and communes. In the Jilin region, many vivid examples of "workers helping farmers" and "farmers supporting workers" have emerged, promoting a new communist spirit.
    The mass movement of industrial support for agriculture in Jilin City began universally after the Third Congress of the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in November of last year. During the nationwide steelmaking campaign in 1958, the Municipal Party Committee raised the issue of industrial support for agriculture, but it did not form a movement. In addition, in the long-term construction process in the Northeast, the idea of developing industry and fully supporting industry was repeatedly promoted, resulting in some people temporarily lacking sufficient understanding of the importance of developing agriculture and industrial support for agriculture. At the Third Municipal Party Congress, the central government's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and industry serving agriculture was discussed. Based on the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the local situation, accelerating industrial support for agriculture and carrying out agricultural technical transformation was taken as the central task. Through studying documents, analyzing the situation, and examining thinking, everyone realized the importance of industrial support for agriculture. Comrades in the industrial sector expressed their willingness to serve agriculture wholeheartedly and do their best to support agricultural technical transformation. After raising the awareness of these leading figures, the Municipal Party Congress passed a resolution to accelerate the realization of agricultural technical transformation. After in-depth publicity and implementation among the city's workers, because most of the workers came from rural areas and had deep feelings for the countryside, as long as the reasons were clearly explained and the direction was pointed out, once mobilized, a high tide of industrial support for agriculture quickly swept the city.
    Jilin City is a relatively developed heavy industrial city, which is a favorable condition for supporting agricultural technical transformation. As soon as the Municipal Party Congress concluded, various factories and enterprises, based on their own production characteristics and the requirements of agricultural production, actively supported agricultural technical transformation through methods such as assigning areas of responsibility and linking factories to communes. According to the plan of the Municipal Party Committee, their first step was to help mechanize the "logistics departments" of the communes, striving to free up a large amount of labor (the preliminary plan is that the implementation of mechanization throughout the region can free up 100,000 laborers). At the same time, they are helping each commune establish a machinery factory to lay the foundation for commune industry.
    At present, Jiangbei Machinery Factory is helping Shulan County establish a general machinery factory and three agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants. The Baishan Commune in the suburbs of Jilin City has also established a machinery factory with the help of a nearby factory. Fengman Power Plant organized 80 technicians to help the communes in Yongji County manufacture and design equipment for hydroelectric power stations and help install lines. Jilin Chemical Industry Company has extracted 12 cadres to help Jiaohe design a chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 2,000 tons of synthetic ammonia.
    According to the statistics of 32 units, it is planned to help counties and communes build 51 various factories this year (including 34 machinery factories and 6 chemical factories), and 16 factories have been basically completed.
    The second is that various machinery factories are stepping up the manufacture and supply of a large number of various agricultural implements that can immediately benefit current agricultural production, including chaff cutters, crushing machinery, and canteen tools that can replace agricultural "logistics" labor and heavy labor. Enterprises that undertake the task of supporting national and provincial construction are also squeezing out some of their strength to produce agricultural tools and machinery for the region, increase new products or new construction projects, without affecting the original production tasks. For example, Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory has extracted 11% of its production capacity for this purpose. Some enterprises, without affecting production, cleared out some surplus or old equipment, tools, and materials from the warehouse to support the countryside, according to the principle of equivalent exchange.
    The third is that many enterprises are training various technical workers for the communes. Some are sending people from the communes to the factories to become apprentices and learn technology, and some are sending technicians from various factory workshops to the communes for short-term rotations (three months, two months, etc.) to impart technology.
    In the upsurge of industrial support for agriculture, many vivid and moving events have occurred. Most of the workers in Jilin City come from farmers, are familiar with the countryside, and love the countryside. Hearing that they were going to install electric lights, set up factories, and repair tractors for the countryside, they said: "We come from the countryside, our homes are in the countryside, if we don't support agricultural production, who will?" Many workers take their tools and ride their bicycles to the communes to help repair agricultural tools or machinery during their days off. Their slogan is "Go to the commune to spend Sunday." They don't want rewards and don't even think about taking a day off. Under this encouragement and help, the countryside also actively supports the factories with various non-staple foods. Because the city vigorously supports the countryside and industry vigorously supports agriculture, the relationship between the city and the countryside and between workers and farmers is closer, and the worker-peasant alliance has been newly developed on a new basis. It has become a trend for workers and farmers to organize delegations to visit each other. Since the Municipal Party Congress, the districts and factories in the city alone have organized 191 delegations to visit the communes. Through visits, feelings have been deepened, information has been communicated, and mutual support has been actively and spontaneously provided.
    Jilin City's industrial support for agriculture has developed towards regularization. Factories, mines, and enterprises have generally established special organizations for supporting agricultural technical transformation. These organizations often send people to the communes and commune-run factories they are linked to for visits and assistance. The city, counties, and communes have all established agricultural technical transformation committees or leading groups, led by the Party Committee Secretary himself, with special organizations or personnel responsible for daily work. The Jilin Municipal Party Committee has also specifically divided the counties and communes responsible for supporting industrial and mining enterprises and urban areas, implementing "contracting by region, contracting by task, and contracting to the end," which has played a very good role in the planned support of industry to agriculture.

    包地区  包任务  一包到底
    吉林市各厂全面支援农业
    本报长春9日电　吉林市工矿企业和职工群众，在“厂厂有支援，班班有贡献，人人都出力”的口号下，对农业进行了大力的支援，两个多月来，吉林市工业部门已支援吉林地区（包括吉林市郊和市属磐石、桦甸、蛟河、永吉、舒兰五县）农村各种粉碎机、铡草机、机床、电动机、水泵等二百五十二项共七万零四百一十二件。吉林市各厂矿企业和工人，为了加速农业技术改造和保证农业生产的持续跃进，一面积极生产当前急需的农机具；一面纷纷组织支援农业的服务队，帮助发展县、社工业，或给公社修理、制做农具零件，或由各厂为各县、社培训技术力量。在吉林地区，出现了许多“工帮农”、“农援工”的生动事例，发扬了共产主义新风格。
    吉林市工业支援农业群众运动是从去年11月中共吉林市第三次代表大会后普遍展开的。在1958年全民炼钢时期，市委即曾提出工业支援农业的问题，但未形成运动，加之在东北长期的建设过程中，反复宣传发展工业、全力支援工业的思想，因之对于发展农业和工业支援农业的重要性，在有些人中一时认识不足。在市第三次党代表大会上，讨论了中央确定的国民经济以农业为基础和工业为农业服务的方针，根据省委的指示和当地情况，将工业支援农业、加速进行农业技术改造作为中心课题。通过学习文件、分析形势、检查思想，大家认识到工业支援农业的重要意义，工业部门的同志纷纷表示要全心全意为农业服务，尽最大力量支援农业技术改造。在提高了这些领导骨干的思想以后，市党代表大会通过了加速实现农业技术改造的决议。经过在全市职工中进行深入的宣传、贯彻，由于大多数工人都来自农村，同农村有深厚的感情，只要讲清道理，指明方向，一经发动，在全市范围内很快地掀起了工业支援农业的热潮。
    吉林市是一个工业比较发达的重工业城市，这是支援农业技术改造的有利条件。当市党代表大会刚一结束，各工厂企业就根据自己的生产特点和农业生产的要求，通过分片包干、厂社挂钩的办法，积极支援农业技术改造。根据市委的计划，他们的第一个步骤，是先帮助把公社的“后勤部门机械化，争取从中解放出大量劳动力（初步计划，全区实行机械化，可解放十万个劳动力）。同时帮助每个公社建立一个机械厂，奠定公社工业的基础。
    目前江北机械厂帮助舒兰县建立了一个通用机械厂、三个农业机械修配厂，吉林市郊白山公社也在附近一个工厂帮助下建立了机械厂。丰满发电厂组织八十名技工，帮助永吉县各公社制造和设计水电站的设备，帮助安装线路。吉林化学工业公司抽出十二名干部，帮助蛟河设计了一个年产二千吨合成氨的化肥厂。
    据三十二个单位的统计，计划在今年内帮助县、社建设各种工厂五十一个（其中机械厂三十四个，化工厂六个），有十六个工厂已经基本建成。
    其次是各机械工厂加紧制造和供应大批当前农业生产立即见效的各种农机具，包括可以代替农业“后勤”劳力多劳力重的铡草机、粉碎机械和食堂工具等。担负支援全国、全省建设任务的企业，在不影响原来生产任务的前提下，也挤出一部分力量为本地区生产农具和机械，增加新产品或新的建设项目，如吉林省机械厂就为此抽出了11％的生产能力。有些企业在不影响生产的条件下，按着等价交换的原则，把一部分多余的或者废旧的设备、工具和材料，从仓库中清理出来，支援农村。
    再其次是，很多企业为公社培训各种技术工人。有的是由公社送人到工厂去当徒弟学技术，有的是由工厂各车间派技术工人，短期轮换（三个月、两个月不等）到公社传授技术。
    在工业支援农业的热潮中，出现了许多生动感人的事例。吉林市的工人大部分出身于农民，熟悉农村也热爱农村。听说要给农村装电灯、设工厂、修拖拉机，他们说：“我们来自农村，家在农村，我们不支援农业生产谁支援？”许多工人公休的时候，带着工具，骑上自行车，到公社帮助修理农具或机械，他们的口号是“到公社去过星期天”。他们不要报酬，也没想到公休。在这种鼓舞和帮助下，农村也主动支援各种副食品给工厂。由于城市大力支援农村，工业大力支援农业，城、乡和工、农之间的关系更密切了，工农联盟在新的基础上有了新的发展，工人和农民组织代表团互相参观访问已成了风气。从市党代表大会以后，仅市内各区和工厂就组织了一百九十一个代表团到公社访问，通过参观访问密切了感情，沟通了情况，积极主动地互相支援。
    吉林市工业支援农业的工作已经向经常化发展。各厂矿企业普遍建立了支援农业技术改造的专门机构，这些机构经常派人到挂钩的公社和社办工厂去访问和进行帮助。市、县、公社都成立了农业技术改造委员会或领导小组，由党委书记亲自挂帅，设有专门机构或专人负责日常工作。吉林市委还具体划分了工矿和城区负责支援的县、社，实行“包地区、包任务、一包到底”，这对工业有计划地支援农业，起了很好的作用。
