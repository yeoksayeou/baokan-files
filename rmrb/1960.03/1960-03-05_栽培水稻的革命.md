    Revolution in Rice Cultivation

    An encouraging piece of good news has arrived: This year, China's paddy field areas will promote the large-scale use of rice transplanters. For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have been bending over to transplant rice seedlings by hand. Now, this arduous labor will be replaced by machinery.

    The promotion and popularization of rice transplanters will enable the vast paddy field areas of our country to take a big step towards agricultural mechanization. Although most of the rice transplanters we are currently using are still driven by human power, and these transplanters are newly developed and inevitably have some shortcomings, we must not underestimate their significance because of this. It should be affirmed that, after repeated tests in production practice, our rice transplanters will be continuously improved and gradually perfected. In the future, once there is a large number of power-driven machines, transplanting operations can be easily transitioned from semi-mechanization to complete mechanization. Therefore, the promotion and use of rice transplanters is a revolution in rice cultivation in our country.

      This year, China's rice planting area will be nearly 500 million mu. This is a crop that uses the most labor in all agricultural production. Because rice cultivation requires a lot of labor, coupled with the concentration of rice-producing areas, the labor situation appears particularly tight every year during the transplanting season. Especially in double-cropping rice areas, the harvesting of early rice and the transplanting of late rice are closely linked, and labor is particularly tight. Implementing mechanical transplanting can save labor, seize the season, complete the transplanting work in a timely manner, and ensure the smooth growth of rice.

    Rice is a high-yield crop. With the realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of transplanting and other operations, the contradiction of labor shortage can be solved, and the rice planting area can be appropriately expanded according to the needs of the country. Using mechanical transplanting is not only efficient but also of good quality, meeting the specifications for dense planting, and thus can produce more than manual transplanting. Not only that, in the future, with the realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of transplanting and other operations, a large amount of labor can be saved from rice production and invested in diversified operations. In this way, it will promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. It can be seen that the widespread application of rice transplanters will have a profound impact not only on rice production itself but also on the entire agricultural production.

    The promotion and use of a new production tool will never be smooth sailing. Various localities still lack experience in manufacturing and using rice transplanters, and it is also difficult to train enough highly skilled technicians in a short period of time. These are possible difficulties. But these are the difficulties in the growth of new things and can be completely overcome. We should have firm confidence. The past experience of promoting new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows has proved that the same new tool, due to its different encounters in different places, produces different effects. The key to the problem is whether people cherish it with full enthusiasm and whether they adopt a resolute attitude and meticulous measures to promote it. When starting to promote rice transplanters, it is necessary for us to revisit this experience in order to do this work better.

    Currently, various localities are organizing strong professional technical teams, stepping up the manufacturing of rice transplanters, and training operators to create conditions for the large-scale promotion of rice transplanters. We believe that through everyone's unremitting efforts, rice transplanters will become more and more perfect, and will soon become a tool for increasing production in the hands of the vast number of farmers. Once the brave, hardworking, and energetic farmers master this tool, they will surely be able to create more fruitful results in the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

### 栽培水稻的革命

    栽培水稻的革命
    一件振奋人心的喜讯传来了：今年我国水田地区将要大规模地推广使用插秧机。千百年来，我国农民都是弯腰曲背用手插秧，如今这项繁重的劳动将由机械来代替了。
    插秧机的推广和普及，将使我国广大水田地区向农业机械化跨进一大步。虽然我们现在使用的插秧机多数还是靠人力牵动的；这些插秧机诞生不久，也难免存在一些缺点，但是决不能因此低估它的意义。应该肯定，经过生产实践的反复考验，我们的插秧机将会不断改进，逐渐完善起来。将来一旦有了大量的动力牵引机械，插秧作业就可以比较容易地由半机械化过渡到完全的机械化。所以，插秧机的推广使用，是我国水稻栽培上的革命。
      今年我国水稻种植面积将近五亿亩。在全部农业生产中这是占用劳动力最多的一种作物。因为水稻栽培上用工很多，再加上水稻产区集中，每年到插秧季节，劳动力的情况显得特别紧张。特别是双季稻产区，早稻收割和晚稻插秧紧密衔接，劳力尤为紧张。实行机械插秧，就可以做到省人力，抢季节，及时完成插秧工作，保证水稻顺利生长。
    水稻是高产作物，随着插秧和其他作业半机械化和机械化的实现，解决了劳力不足的矛盾，就可以根据国家的需要适当扩大水稻播种面积；用机械插秧，不但效率高，而且质量也好，符合密植规格，因而也能比用手插秧增产更多。不仅这样，今后随着插秧和其他作业半机械化和机械化的实现，将可以从水稻生产方面节省出大量的劳动力投入多种经营，这样，就会促进农、林、牧、副、渔各业的全面发展。由此可见，插秧机的广泛应用，不仅对于水稻生产本身，而且对于整个农业生产都将发生深远的影响。
    一项新的生产工具的推广和使用，决不会是一帆风顺的。各地对于制造和使用插秧机还缺乏经验，一时也很难训练出足够的、十分熟练的技术人员，这些都是可能碰到的困难。但是这是新生事物成长中的困难，是完全能够克服的，应当有坚定的信心。过去推广双轮双铧犁等新式农具的经验证明，同样一种新工具，由于它在各个地方的遭遇不同，新工具所产生的效果也大小不一。问题的关键在于人们是不是满腔热情地爱护它，是不是采取坚决的态度和细致的措施去推广它。在开始推广水稻插秧机的时候，我们有必要重温一下这个经验，以便使这项工作做得更好。
    现在，各地正在组织强大的专业技术队伍，加紧插秧机的制造和训练操作手，为大规模推广插秧机创造条件。我们相信，经过大家不懈的努力，插秧机将会越来越完善，将会很快地成为广大农民手中的增产利器，勇敢勤劳、干劲冲天的农民，一旦掌握了这种利器，就一定能在1960年的农业生产的持续跃进中创造更丰硕的果实。
