Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan - The technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations has developed into a mass movement on a national scale in Hubei Province. The broad masses in various departments such as industry, transportation, agriculture, large-scale water conservancy construction sites, commerce, service industries, and science, culture, and education, have enthusiastically invested in this movement. A large amount of heavy physical labor and manual operations have been replaced by mechanized and semi-mechanized production. People joyfully describe this scene: "No one beside the hammer, iron smelting by electric button"; "No one sees people moving at the furnace, all workers operate machines"; "Only the roar of machines is heard, no more 'heave-ho' chants"; "Grain is sold without measures, oil is sold without ladles, storage without carrying"; "Rice is washed without hands, vegetables are cut without knives, food slides smoothly."

Workers on the industrial and transportation fronts are at the forefront of the movement. According to statistics from 2,917 industrial enterprises above the county level, from the end of last year to February 25th this year, 12,300 manual operations have been transformed into mechanization and semi-mechanization. At the same time, there have also emerged 124 automated and semi-automated production lines, and 1,051 automated and semi-automated single machines. Due to the increase in the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, more than 42,000 laborers have been saved and are being transferred to other construction posts. In terms of loading and unloading workers in transportation and construction and installation workers in basic construction, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has reached 62.9% and 51.3% respectively, both increased by about 15% compared to the end of last year.

In rural areas, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on realizing "four reforms and two eliminations" (i.e., reforming tools for cultivation, processing, water lifting, and transportation, and eliminating shoulder carrying and human-powered water drawing) is also flourishing. More than 200,000 people in Jingzhou Prefecture, after more than a month of hard work, created 560,000 improved farming tools, basically meeting the needs of spring plowing and production. Xiangyang Prefecture makes full use of hydropower as power, and has established more than 6,900 hydropower processing plants; this alone can save 140,000 laborers throughout the year.

In the commercial sector, from acquisition, processing, storage, transfer, sales, to catering, service and other aspects, technical innovation blossoms everywhere. According to incomplete statistics, more than 6,700 tools have been innovated in more than a month. The implementation of the integration of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research in the cultural and educational system has also greatly promoted the cultural revolution and the technical revolution.

This newspaper reports that the industrial front of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, and production and construction are showing a good and prosperous scene.

The industrial systems of metallurgy, coal, machinery, and light industry have developed the technical innovation movement very rapidly this year because they formulated a plan for comprehensive technical transformation at the end of last year. At present, more than 100 small coal kilns, accounting for one-third of the region's raw coal output, are manufacturing and installing wooden winches, wooden rails, earthen water pumps and other lifting, transportation, drainage and other machinery and equipment. Some small coal kilns are already installing small water pumps and electric winches, striving to completely eliminate heavy physical labor in the short term. The region's iron smelting production has developed from "small earthen groups" as the mainstay to "small foreign groups" as the mainstay. Due to the active promotion of the large-bellied furnace type and the implementation of technical measures such as increasing air volume and increasing air temperature, the utilization coefficient of the small blast furnaces in some iron plants has increased by more than doubled compared to the past.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, all localities resolutely implement the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," and adopt the method of starting from indigenous methods and gradually moving from indigenous to foreign, and particularly emphasize self-reliance and learning from foreign experience. In the technical innovation, many factories and mines adopt the "five determinations" method of determining people, time, projects, measures, and inspections, so that the technical innovation has both clear goals and specific measures, promoting the development of the movement. Some factories and mines have jumped from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization. The Pingluo County Farm Implement Factory originally had only one machine tool that was about to be scrapped. After hard work by the workers and self-made machinery, it now has 14 lathes and drilling machines and other equipment; the main processes of production in four of the seven workshops have realized semi-mechanization and mechanization, and production efficiency has increased by one to fifty times. The timber factory of the Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau used earthen machinery to replace manual operations in 13 processes such as planing and sawing. The work done by 220 workers in the past only requires 140 people now. After the coal system promoted more than 50 advanced experiences such as "four-shift cross-operation," production efficiency has been significantly improved. For example, the production and tunneling efficiency of the Shizuishan Coal Mining Bureau in January increased by 60% compared with the fourth quarter of last year.

This newspaper reports that the factories and mines in Urumqi City, Xinjiang, have made significant achievements in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. According to statistics, since the beginning of this year, in the factories and mines under the city's jurisdiction, 64 types of work have been mechanized and semi-mechanized from manual operations, and the backward situation of production with hammers, axes, carrying poles, and baskets for many years is rapidly changing.

At the beginning of this year, the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized the workers in the city's handicraft industry to carry out activities such as a technical innovation assault month and assault period. After the Tian Shan District Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium on technical innovation for leading cadres, technicians, and veteran workers in January, it immediately took the Red Flag Cage and Basket Wood Factory, which had made outstanding achievements in realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, as the banner, and launched a technical innovation competition upsurge of "comparing, learning, catching up, and helping" throughout the district. Since January, the district has successively trial-produced 25 advanced machines and tools such as drilling machines, cutting saws, three-purpose milling machines, and electric drilling machines, enabling 29 processes such as sewing, machine repair, and woodworking production to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization, increasing work efficiency by 10 to 30 times. In order to enable this movement to "break through one point and bloom in all directions," the Industry and Transportation Department of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have recently held on-site meetings in succession, focusing on introducing the experiences of the Red Flag Cage and Basket Wood Factory and other units in Tian Shan District in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, which has greatly promoted the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement in the city.

At present, the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement in the city has developed from some factory and mine production departments to transportation, loading and unloading, construction, agriculture, commerce, and service departments. In the past, it took twelve laborers 20 minutes to unload a truck of grain at the First Warehouse of the Urumqi Grain Bureau. Now, using grain conveyors for unloading and stacking, it only takes eight people five minutes, which can save more than 4,300 laborers throughout the year.

    锤旁不见人　打铁按电门　售粮不用斗　入仓不用背
    湖北宁夏各行各业有革新
    乌鲁木齐厂矿企业革新运动步步深入
    新华社武汉电　以手工操作机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命，已经在湖北省发展成为全民规模的群众运动。工业、交通、农业、大型水利工地、商业、服务业，以及科学文教等各部门的广大群众，都热情地投入到这一运动中来。大量笨重的体力劳动和手工操作为机械化半机械化生产所代替，人们欢欣鼓舞地形容这一景象：“锤旁不见人，打铁按电门”；“不见人动高炉起，全是工人开机器”；“只听机器轰轰响，不闻嗬唷号子声”；“售粮不用斗，打油不用吊，入仓不用背”；“洗米不用手，切菜不用刀，饭菜滑丝走”。
    工业、交通战线的职工站在运动最前列。据二千九百一十七个县以上工业企业统计，从去年年底到今年2月25日为止，已将一万二千三百项手工操作变为机械化半机械化。与此同时，还出现了自动化半自动化的生产流水线一百二十四条，自动化半自动化单机一千零五十一台。由于机械化半机械化程度的提高，已经节省出劳动力四万二千多人，正调往其他建设岗位。交通运输方面按装卸工人计算，基本建设方面按建筑安装工人计算，机械化半机械化程度已分别达到62．9％和51．3％，都比去年年底提高约15％左右。
    在农村，以实现“四改两消灭”（即改革耕作、加工、提水、运输等工具，消灭肩挑背驮和人力车水现象）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，也正在蓬勃发展。荆州专区二十多万人经过一个多月的奋战，创造出各种改良耕作工具五十六万件，基本上满足了春耕生产的需要。襄阳专区充分利用水力作动力，办起了水力加工厂六千九百多处；仅此一项，全年即可节约十四万个劳动力。
    在商业部门，从收购、加工、储存、调运、销售，一直到饮食、服务等各方面，都盛开技术革新花朵，据不完全统计，一个多月来共已革新工具达六千七百多项。文教系统实行教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合，对文化革命、技术革命也起了很大的推动作用。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区工业战线大搞技术革新和技术革命，生产建设呈现一片大好的繁荣景象。
    冶金、煤炭、机械、轻工等工业系统由于去年年底就制订了全面进行技术改造的规划，今年的技术革新运动开展得很迅速。目前，占全区原煤产量三分之一的百余处小煤窑，正在制造和安装木绞车、木轨道、土抽水机等提升、运输、排水等机器设备，部分小煤窑已在安装小型水泵、电力绞车，力争在短期内彻底消灭笨重体力劳动。全区炼铁生产已从“小土群”为主发展到以“小洋群”为主。由于积极推广大肚子炉的炉型，推行增加风量、提高风温等技术措施，有的铁厂小高炉的利用系数已比过去提高一倍多。
    各地在技术革新和技术革命运动中，坚决贯彻“土洋并举”方针，采取从土起步，逐步由土到洋的办法，并且特别强调自力更生和学习外地经验。不少厂矿在技术革新中，采取定人、定时、定项目、定措施、定检查等“五定”方法，使技术革新既有明确的目标，又有具体的措施，推进了运动的发展。有些厂矿已经由手工操作跃到了半机械化、机械化。平罗县农具厂原来只有一台快报废的机床，经过工人艰苦奋斗，自造机械，如今已有十四台车床和钻床等设备；七个车间中有四个车间的主要工序生产过程实现了半机械化和机械化，生产效率提高了一到五十倍。青铜峡水利工程局木工厂在刨、锯等十三道工序上用土机械代替了手工操作，过去全厂二百二十名工人做的活，现在只要一百四十人就行了。煤炭系统推广了“四班交叉作业”等五十多项先进经验以后，生产效率显著提高，如石嘴山煤炭矿务局元月份生产和掘进效率，就较去年第四季度提高了60％。
    本报讯　新疆乌鲁木齐市厂矿企业大闹技术革新和技术革命运动，收到显著成绩。据统计：今年以来，全市所属厂矿企业中，已经有六十四个工种由手工操作实现了机械化、半机械化，多少年来用锤子、斧子、扁担、筐子生产的落后面貌正在迅速改变着。
    今年一开始，中共乌鲁木齐市委就组织全市手工业行业职工开展了技术革新突击月、突击旬等活动。中共天山区委元月份召开了领导干部、技术人员、老工人技术革新座谈会以后，立即以实现机械化、半机械化取得突出成绩的红旗笼箩木器厂为旗帜，在全区范围内掀起了“比、学、赶、帮”的技术革新竞赛高潮。元月份以来，全区先后试制成功了打眼机、下料锯、三用铣床、电动钻床等二十五台先进机具，使缝纫、机器修理、木器生产等二十九道工序实现了机械化和半机械化，提高了工效十倍至三十倍。为了使这一运动能“突破一点，全面开花”，中共乌鲁木齐市委工业交通部、市工会，最近连续召开了现场会议，重点介绍了天山区红旗笼箩木器厂等单位大搞技术革新和技术革命的经验，对推动全市技术革新运动的深入开展起了很大作用。
    目前，全市机械化、半机械化运动已经从一些厂矿生产部门，发展到交通运输、装卸、建筑、农业、商业以及服务部门。乌鲁木齐市粮食局第一仓库，过去十二个劳动力二十分钟才能卸完一车粮食，现在采用粮食输送机来卸粮、码垛以后，只需八个人五分钟就行了，全年可以节省四千三百多个劳动力。
