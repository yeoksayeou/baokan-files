    The Situation in Laos
    Zeng Hao
    The current situation in Laos has aroused widespread attention from the world public. In the past two or three months, the political situation in Laos has been changing and developing mainly around the election issue. The Lao Royal Government announced that it would hold general elections on April 24, but it refused to release Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, and other leaders who were imprisoned; and continued the civil war, intensifying the "mopping-up" operations. At the same time, US imperialism's interference and aggression in Laos has intensified.
    In order to prevent the further deterioration of the situation in Laos, Phạm Văn Đồng, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a participant in the Geneva Conference and a signatory to the Geneva Accords, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the chairman of the International Commission for Laos on March 3 and 8 respectively, requesting them to take measures to stop US violations of Laos; restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos; and ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front also issued a statement requesting the Royal Government to immediately stop the civil war, restore the normal situation in Laos, and enable the general election to be conducted in accordance with the Constitution of the Kingdom of Laos and the original election regulations.

    One Year of Situation Evolution
    The current serious situation in Laos is inseparable from the evolution of its situation over the past year. 1959 was a year of great change in the situation in Laos. In that year, the Lao Royal Government, at the instigation of US imperialism, abandoned the Geneva Accords; refused the International Commission for Laos to continue its activities; and openly launched a civil war in May, attempting to eliminate the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. The United States not only controlled the Lao government and army through some pro-American politicians and soldiers in Laos, but also greatly expanded its military buildup in Laos, establishing many military bases to turn Laos into an "anti-communist fortress" and a new colony of the United States.
    Under these circumstances, whether the Geneva Accords could continue to be implemented in Laos, whether Laos would continue to follow the path of peace and neutrality, and whether the Lao people's desire for peace, independence, democracy, unity, and neutrality could be realized became very acute questions.
    Over the past year, a fierce struggle has unfolded between US imperialism and the Lao ultra-pro-American elements, who have been trying their best to undermine the Geneva Accords (and the Vientiane Agreements that arose from the Geneva Accords), and the Lao patriotic and democratic forces who are determined to uphold the Geneva Accords (and the Vientiane Agreements). This struggle has roughly gone through four rounds.
    The first round was the Sanaikone government's armed attack on two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units in May of last year. It used all means of coercion and inducement, and surrounded them with forces several times larger than these two battalions, attempting to wipe them out all at once. However, apart from some people being unreasonably persecuted, the vast majority of officers and soldiers of these two battalions, in order to defend the interests of the Lao people and oppose turning Laos into a military base of US imperialism, bravely broke through the encirclement and moved to new locations.
    The second round occurred in July and August of last year, when the Sanaikone government launched a movement throughout the country to persecute personnel of the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and arrested Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. However, this persecution movement did not intimidate the Lao patriotic and democratic forces, but instead aroused the indignation and resistance of the Lao people. People rose up in self-defense, forming a broad people's self-defense armed struggle that spread across several provinces in northern and central Laos.
    Immediately following was the third round. On the one hand, the United States intensified the transportation of large quantities of weapons and ammunition into Laos and sent military personnel to Laos to plan the expansion of the Lao civil war; on the other hand, it clamored for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the United Nations to send troops to Laos, attempting to turn the Lao civil war into an international war. Due to the warnings from the socialist camp and world public opinion, the US conspiracy to directly send troops failed. However, despite repeated objections from the Soviet Union, the United States, in the name of the United Nations Security Council, illegally dispatched a so-called "United Nations Fact-Finding Mission" to Laos to investigate the so-called "aggression" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The purpose of this conspiracy was to fabricate "external threats" to create a pretext for the United States to take direct military action. It was only because the "evidence" fabricated by the Lao authorities was too unconvincing that even such a pro-US "investigation" organization had to admit in its report that there was no basis for the claim that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had invaded Laos. Thus, this round also ended in the failure of US imperialism and the Lao ultra-pro-American elements.
    The fourth round was US imperialism instigating the Lao authorities to announce an illegal trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front; attempting to implement a high-pressure policy against the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and fundamentally blocking the path to negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. But this conspiracy also failed. As soon as the Lao authorities announced this decision, it was opposed by the Lao people and insightful people in the Lao government and army; and aroused condemnation from all countries and people concerned about peace in Indochina. As a result, the Lao authorities had to repeatedly announce postponements of the trial.

    New US Tactics in Laos
    After the conspiracies planned by US imperialism in Laos repeatedly failed, it changed to another set of deceptive tactics.
    The hallmark of this change was a statement issued by the US State Department on January 4 this year. At that time, the US military advisory group in Laos, on the orders of the US Department of Defense, was colluding with the Thai authorities to instruct pro-American Lao officers such as Phoumi Nosavan to launch a coup. The purpose of this coup was to move Laos further towards military dictatorship in order to kill Prince Souphanouvong and others, eliminate the Lao patriotic and democratic forces, and turn Laos into another US base of aggression in Southeast Asia. However, the US State Department, in its statement, pretended to say something like "We hope that the policies of the Lao government will not undergo changes that affect Laos' 'peaceful and neutral' international status." The statement also hypocritically stated that "Laos has always been peaceful and neutral." If we review the statements made by the US government and officials on the Laos issue in recent years, we will find that this is the first time that the rhetoric of Lao peace and neutrality has come from the mouth of a US official.
    Immediately following, the Lao interim government announced that it would hold general elections on April 24. Phoumi Nosavan, the main instigator of the coup in Laos at the end of last year and the current Lao Minister of National Defense, also echoed the same tune as the United States. On January 18, he publicly proclaimed: "There is still a possibility of peaceful coexistence between Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam"; "The Lao Patriotic Front, whose leaders are being imprisoned, has not been dissolved, and they can nominate candidates and participate in the election without any obstacles." But then he said something like "The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has supported domestic rebellion in Laos and created border disputes, thereby making the relationship between the two countries tense, and the issue of coexistence with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam depends on the attitude of this country (referring to Vietnam)."
    Phoumi Nosavan's remarks were intended to achieve many goals. First, he attempted to use the method of reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white to both justify his abandonment of peaceful coexistence and place all the responsibility on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Second, he falsely accused some leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the Lao people who are carrying out self-defensive armed struggles in various parts of Laos of being "rebels" and falsely accused them of "colluding" with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; in this way, he concealed the reactionary essence of the Lao authorities' unreasonable deprivation of the Lao patriotic and democratic forces' right to participate in the general election, illegal imprisonment, and "mopping-up" operations. Third, he also used the guise of "participating in the election without any obstacles" to lure other members of the Lao Patriotic Front to lay down their weapons and serve US imperialism.
    This is the concrete application of the US "peaceful victory strategy" in Laos.
    The reason why the United States wants to use new tactics in Laos, that is, the tactics of simultaneously advancing with "peaceful victory" and "victory through war," is not only to cooperate with the two-pronged approach it is currently taking around the world, but more importantly because it has suffered repeated failures in Laos over the past year.
    According to "Lao Patriotic News," in the second half of 1959 alone, the Lao Royal Army, under the direct command of US military advisors, launched more than 500 "mopping-up" battles. But the result was only to arouse wider resistance from the Lao people, causing great losses to the Royal Army. In the half-year of fighting, the Lao people killed 916 members of the Royal Army, wounded 876, and captured 151; as for weapons and ammunition, the People's Guerrilla Force captured even more. Due to this situation, while continuing to intensify the expansion of the Lao Royal Army and intensify the suppression of the Lao people, the United States also attempted to deceive and divide the Lao people by "peaceful" means.
    After Dag Hammarskjöld visited Laos in November of last year, Riley, Chief of Staff of the US Pacific Armed Forces, also visited Laos. The former went to "persuade" the Lao Royal Government to put on a peaceful and neutral posture, while the latter went specifically to Sam Neua Province and the Plain of Jars, where the Lao People's Self-Defense Armed Forces are more active, to arrange for larger "mopping-up" operations. On the surface, the two people's tasks seem to be different, but in reality, they are both serving the US's new two-pronged approach. Vientiane Radio once reported that the United States is extensively repairing heavy-duty airports in Laos, and the Muong Khong Airport in Bassac Province was completed on February 6. "Lao Patriotic News" also reported that the United States has newly built 30 military airports in Laos, most of which have been completed, including the aforementioned Muong Khong Airport, as well as Wattay, Ban Nam Thoum, the Plain of Jars, and other airports that can be used for heavy aircraft to land. US Pacific Army Commander-in-Chief White also rushed to Vientiane on February 19 to hold secret talks with Lao Defense Minister Phoumi Nosavan to accelerate the plan to build US military bases in Laos. According to "US News & World Report," published on January 25, "The Pentagon in Washington and the Ministry of Defense in London are actively formulating detailed plans. If necessary, the US and British 'police forces' can enter Laos after receiving notification." It also revealed that US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons had secret talks with senior French officials in order to coordinate actions in Laos. According to a Reuters report from Vientiane on March 11, "All Lao troops are being mobilized in order to launch a large-scale offensive against the Pathet Lao rebels immediately." "Lao Patriotic News" said that the Lao Royal Government is recently preparing to "try" Prince Souphanouvong and others.
    The above situation shows that while implementing the "peace strategy" in Laos, the United States has never and will never relax its "war strategy." And no matter which strategy it is, the United States has only one purpose in Laos: to completely eliminate the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and turn Laos into its war base and new colony.

    The Future Development of the Situation
    The evolution of the situation in Laos over the past year, especially the struggle between the United States and a small number of ultra-pro-American elements in Laos and the Lao people over the Lao general election issue in the past two or three months, clearly shows that there is a struggle between two paths in Laos.
    One path is the path of the United States dragging Laos into the aggressive military bloc system and turning Laos into a new colony of the United States. This path is not only unfavorable to the Lao people, but also not beneficial to the Lao Royal Government. Because if it follows the United States, it will become increasingly detached from the Lao people and increasingly place itself under the control of the United States, causing Laos to completely lose its independence and freedom.
    The other path is the path pointed out by the Geneva Accords, that is, Laos living in harmony with all its neighbors, not joining any military blocs, and not providing military bases for foreign countries, and adopting a path of national reconciliation and unity within the country that absorbs all citizens into the common life of the country. For the Lao people, this is a broad road. Even for the Lao Royal Government itself, taking this path is beneficial. Because this helps stabilize the political situation in Laos.
    Which path Laos will take ultimately depends not on the subjective wishes of US imperialism or anyone else, but on the choice of the broad Lao people. The Lao people have firmly demanded to take the path of peace and neutrality pointed out by the Geneva Accords in the past year. It can be expected that as long as they unite, heighten their vigilance, and persist in the struggle, they will eventually make the Kingdom of Laos a peaceful, independent, unified, democratic, neutral, and prosperous country.

    老挝的局势
    曾浩
    目前，老挝的局势已引起世界公众的普遍注意。最近两三个月来，老挝政局主要围绕着大选问题在变化发展。老挝王国政府宣布将在4月24日举行大选，但它却拒绝释放被监禁的老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王和其他领导人；并且继续进行内战，变本加厉地发动“扫荡”。与此同时，美帝国主义对老挝的干涉和侵略加剧了。
    为了阻止老挝的局势进一步恶化，日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的签字国越南民主共和国外交部长范文同，已经在3月3日和8日分别写信给日内瓦会议的两位主席和老挝国际委员会主席，要求他们采取措施制止美国侵犯老挝的行为；恢复老挝国际委员会的活动；保证日内瓦协议的实施。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会也发表声明，要求王国政府立即停止内战、恢复老挝的正常局势，使大选能根据老挝王国的宪法和原选举的规定进行。
    一年来局势的演变
    老挝当前的严重局势是同它一年来局势的演变分不开的。1959年是老挝局势发生巨大变化的一年。在这一年里，老挝王国政府在美帝国主义的唆使下毁弃了日内瓦协议；拒绝老挝国际委员会继续活动；并在5月间公然发动内战，企图消灭老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队。美国不仅通过老挝一些亲美的政客和军人控制老挝政府和军队，而且在老挝大事扩军备战，建立许多军事基地，要把老挝变成美国的“反共堡垒”和新殖民地。
    在这种情况下，日内瓦协议能否继续在老挝得到贯彻，老挝是否继续走和平中立的道路，老挝人民要求和平、独立、民主、统一和中立的愿望能否实现，就成了十分尖锐的问题。
    一年来，极力破坏日内瓦协议（以及根据日内瓦协议而产生的万象协议）的美帝国主义和老挝极端亲美分子同坚决维护日内瓦协议（以及万象协议）的老挝爱国民主力量之间展开了激烈的斗争。这一斗争大体上经历了四个回合。
    第一个回合是萨纳尼空政府在去年5月间对前寮国战斗部队两个营发动武装进攻。它使出了一切威逼利诱的手段，并且以数倍于这两个营的兵力进行包围，企图一举而全部消灭。但结果除了一部分人遭到无理的迫害而外，这两个营的绝大部分官兵为了捍卫老挝人民的利益、反对把老挝变成美帝国主义的军事基地，英勇地突破重围，转移到了新的驻地。
    第二个回合发生在去年7、8月间，萨纳尼空政府在全国范围内发动了一个迫害老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队人员的运动，并且逮捕了苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人。然而，这个迫害运动并没有把老挝爱国民主力量吓倒，反而激起老挝人民的愤慨和反抗。人们纷纷奋起自卫，形成了遍及老挝北部、中部好几个省的广泛的人民自卫武装斗争。
    紧接着就开始了第三个回合。美国一方面加紧将大量武器、弹药运入老挝，派遣军事人员去老挝策划扩大老挝内战；一方面大叫大嚷要东南亚条约集团和联合国出兵老挝，企图将老挝内战变成国际战争。由于社会主义阵营和世界公正舆论的警告，美国直接出兵的阴谋没能得逞。但是美国不顾苏联的一再反对，又以联合国安全理事会的名义，非法地派遣了一个所谓“联合国调查小组委员会”到老挝调查所谓越南民主共和国的“侵略”。这个阴谋的目的在于捏造“外来威胁”，为美国进行直接的军事行动制造借口。只是老挝当局伪造的“证据”太不像样，即使这样一个御用的“调查”组织，最后也不得不在它的报告中承认，说越南民主共和国侵略老挝是没有根据的。这样，这个回合又以美帝国主义和老挝极端亲美分子的失败而告终。
    第四个回合是美帝国主义唆使老挝当局宣布对苏发努冯亲王等老挝爱国战线党领导人进行非法审讯；企图对老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队实行高压政策，根本堵塞同老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队方面进行谈判的道路。但是这一阴谋也没有能够实现。老挝当局刚一宣布这一决定以后，就遭到了老挝人民以及老挝政府和军队里的有见识的人士的反对；引起了一切关心印度支那和平的国家和人民的纷纷谴责。结果，老挝当局不得不一再宣布延期审判。
    美国在老挝的新手法
    美帝国主义在老挝策划的阴谋连续遭到失败之后，便改用另外一套欺骗手法。
    这一改变的标志是美国国务院今年1月4日发表的一项声明。当时，美国驻老挝的军事顾问团，奉美国国防部的命令，正伙同泰国当局，指使富米·诺萨万等老挝亲美军官发动政变。这次政变的目的就在使老挝更加走向军事独裁，以便杀害苏发努冯亲王等人，消灭老挝爱国民主力量，将老挝变成它在东南亚的另一个侵略基地。但美国国务院在它的声明中却装腔作势地说什么“我们希望，老挝政府的政策不会发生影响到老挝的‘和平和中立的’国际地位的那种改变。”声明还假惺惺地表示“老挝始终是和平中立的。”如果回顾一下美国政府和官方人士近年来关于老挝问题的言论，就会发现，老挝和平中立的论调出诸美国官方之口，这还是第一次。
    紧跟着，老挝临时政府宣布将于4月24日举行大选。去年年底老挝政变的主要发动者、现任老挝国防大臣的富米·诺萨万也唱出了同美国相应的调子，他在1月18日公开宣传：“老挝和越南民主共和国还有和平共处的可能性”；“一些领导人正被监禁的老挝爱国战线党没有被解散，他们可以推举候选人和参加竞选而不会受到任何障碍。”但接着他又说什么“越南民主共和国支持了老挝国内的叛乱，制造了边界的纠纷，从而使两国关系处于紧张状态，同越南民主共和国的共处问题取决于这个国家（指越南）的态度。”
    富米·诺萨万这番谈话的用意是很多的。第一，他企图利用颠倒是非、混淆黑白的手法，既为自己放弃和平共处进行狡辩，又把责任统统推到越南民主共和国方面。第二，将“叛乱分子”的罪名强加在老挝爱国战线党的一些领导人以及在老挝各地进行自卫性武装斗争的前寮国战斗部队和老挝人民的头上，诬蔑他们同越南民主共和国有“勾结”；这样来掩饰老挝当局无理剥夺老挝爱国民主力量参加大选的权利、进行非法监禁和“扫荡”等措施的反动实质。第三，他还以“参加竞选而不会受到任何障碍”为幌子，来诱惑老挝爱国战线党其他人员放下武器，为美帝国主义效力。
    这就是美国的“和平取胜战略”在老挝的具体运用。
    美国所以要在老挝改用新的手法，也就是“和平取胜”和“战争取胜”同时并进的手法，不仅是为了配合它目前在全世界范围内所采取的两面手法，更主要的是由于它一年来在老挝连续遭到失败。
    据“老挝爱国新闻”报道，仅1959年下半年，老挝王国军队在美国军事顾问直接指挥下，就曾发动五百余次“扫荡”战。但结果只是激起老挝人民更广泛的反抗，使王国军队遭到很大损失。在半年战斗中，王国军队被老挝人民击毙九百一十六名，击伤八百七十六名，俘虏一百五十一名；至于武器弹药被人民游击队缴获的就更多了。由于这种情况，美国在继续加紧扩充老挝王国军队、加紧镇压老挝人民的同时，也企图用“和平”手段对老挝人民进行欺骗和分化。
    哈马舍尔德于去年11月间访问老挝之后，美国太平洋地区武装部队参谋长赖利也去老挝访问。前者是去“劝说”老挝王国政府装出一副和平中立的姿态，后者则专门到老挝人民自卫武装比较活跃的桑怒省和查尔平原去布置更大的“扫荡”。表面上看来，两个人任务不一，实际上都是为美国新的两面手法效劳的。万象电台就曾报道，美国正在老挝大修重型飞机场，其中巴色省的芒空机场已于2月6日修成。“老挝爱国新闻”也报道，美国在老挝新建了三十个军用机场，大部分已经建成，其中除上述芒空机场外，尚有瓦泰、弯南塔、查尔平原等机场可供重型飞机着陆。美国太平洋地区陆军总司令怀特也于2月19日赶到万象同老挝国防大臣富米·诺萨万举行秘密会谈，加紧进行在老挝修筑美军基地的计划。据1月25日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，“华盛顿五角大楼和伦敦的国防部正在积极地制订详细的计划。如果需要的话，美英的‘警察部队’在接到通知后就可以开入老挝。”它还透露美国国务院主管远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯曾同法国高级官员秘密会谈，以便在老挝配合行动。另据路透社万象3月11日报道，“老挝所有军队正在动员起来，以便马上对寮国叛乱分子发动大规模的进攻”。“老挝爱国新闻”说，老挝王国政府最近又准备对苏发努冯亲王等人进行“审判”。
    上述情况说明，美国在老挝施行“和平战略”的同时，决没有也不会放松它的“战争战略”。而且不管是哪一种战略，美国在老挝的目的只有一个：那就是彻底消灭老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队，把老挝变为它的战争基地和新殖民地。
    局势的发展前途
    一年来老挝事态的演变，特别是最近两、三个月来美国和老挝少数极端亲美分子同老挝人民围绕老挝大选问题而进行的斗争，清楚地表明，老挝存在着两条道路的斗争。
    一条道路是美国把老挝拉进侵略性军事集团体系，将老挝变成美国新殖民地的道路。这条道路不仅对于老挝人民是不利的，对于老挝王国政府也并不有利。因为如果它跟着美国走的话，就会越来越脱离老挝人民，而且越来越把自己置于美国的控制之下，使老挝完全丧失独立和自由。
    另一条道路是日内瓦协议所指出的道路，也就是老挝同所有邻国和睦相处，不加入任何军事集团和不为外国提供军事基地，在国内采取将全体公民都吸收到国家共同生活中去的民族和解和团结的道路。对于老挝人民来说，这是一条康庄大道。就是对老挝王国政府本身来说，走这条路也是有利的。因为这有助于老挝政治局势的稳定。
    老挝究竟走哪一条道路，这不决定于美帝国主义或者任何人的主观愿望，而决定于老挝广大人民的选择。老挝人民在过去一年中已经坚定地要求走日内瓦协议所指出的和平中立的道路。可以预期，只要他们团结起来，提高警惕，坚持斗争，他们终究会使老挝王国成为一个和平、独立、统一、民主、中立和繁荣的国家的。
