Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 5th: Overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia on the 29th expressed their infinite concern and longing for compatriots and relatives still displaced and destitute in Indonesia. They thanked the government for continuing to send ships to bring back Overseas Chinese and at the same time demanded that the Indonesian authorities bear the responsibility for repatriating Overseas Chinese, so that more Overseas Chinese can end their lives of suffering and return safely to their motherland to participate in socialist construction.

　　Xia Guanzhen, who returned from Riwina, Indonesia, said that after more than 20 of us left Indonesia and returned to the warm family of the motherland, we couldn't help but think of the many relatives who are still being persecuted by powerful groups in Indonesia. They are now displaced and destitute. When we set off to return to China, they all cried bitterly, entrusting us to convey their plight to relatives in the motherland and hoping to return to the motherland as soon as possible. More than 100 Overseas Chinese who returned from Ciwidey, Bandung, all deeply missed the compatriots who had been forcibly concentrated in Lembang with them by powerful Indonesian groups. Among them, more than 200 people have not returned to China and are living in very difficult conditions. They all eagerly hope to return to China as soon as possible. Wen Yaoqing, a returned Overseas Chinese from Garut, Bandung, said that since powerful Indonesian groups launched anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities, all Overseas Chinese who have been forced to relocate and many Overseas Chinese who are threatened with forced relocation have asked to return to China. Many people have lost all their property under persecution and are unable to return; some people cannot set off because of various obstacles. They are all eager to return, and when seeing them off, many Overseas Chinese repeatedly urged them to tell their relatives in the motherland about the situation of the Overseas Chinese. Ye Linxiang, an Overseas Chinese from Mayalazu, said that only more than 90 people returned from their area this time, and many more are waiting to return. An Overseas Chinese surnamed Liu left his wife and son, who had just given birth, in Bandung, and he misses them day and night.

　　Returned Overseas Chinese pointed out that the Indonesian authorities have a responsibility to repatriate Overseas Chinese who have been persecuted in the anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities, so that they can return safely to their motherland. A returned Overseas Chinese surnamed Ye said that I still have my own children there who cannot return. Using basic humanitarianism as a requirement, the Indonesian authorities should also be responsible for sending them back. Chen Yaxiang, a 70-year-old returned Overseas Chinese who has lived in Indonesia for more than 50 years, said that the persecution of Overseas Chinese by powerful Indonesian groups has caused many people to be displaced and destitute, and they have a responsibility to repatriate the Overseas Chinese to China. This is considered respecting the friendship between the two peoples.

    归国华侨提出严正要求
    印度尼西亚当局应承担遣送华侨回国责任
    新华社广州5日电　29日接运回国的印度尼西亚华侨，对尚在印度尼西亚流离失所、生计无着的侨胞和亲友，表示无限关心和想念，感谢政府继续派船接运华侨回国，同时要求印度尼西亚当局承担遣送华侨回国的责任，以使更多华侨早日结束痛苦的生活，平安回到祖国参加社会主义建设。
    一位从印度尼西亚惹维纳温回来的夏关振说，当我们二十多人离开印度尼西亚，回到祖国温暖大家庭以后，不能不想起还有许多亲人在那里继续受到印度尼西亚有势力集团的迫害。他们现在流离失所，生计无着，当我们启程回国时，他们都痛哭流泪，委托我们转致祖国亲人，报告他们的困苦，希望早日回到祖国来。从万隆芝维利回国的一百多华侨，都非常怀念曾经同他们一起被印度尼西亚有势力集团强迫集中到连旺的侨胞，其中还有两百多人没有回国，过着非常困苦的日子，他们都迫切期望早日回国。从万隆牙律回来的归侨温耀清说，自从印度尼西亚有势力集团开展反华排华活动以后，所有受到迫迁的华侨和许多遭受迫迁威胁的华侨，都纷纷要求回国，有不少人在迫害下损失了全部财产，没有能力回来；有些人因为受到种种阻难，不能起程。他们都归心似箭，在送行时，许多华侨都再三叮嘱他们一定要把华侨处境告诉祖国亲人。一位马也拉祖的华侨叶琳祥说，他们那里这次只回来九十多人，还有许多人在等待着回来。有一位姓刘的华侨，留下刚分娩的妻子和儿子在万隆，他日夜在思念他们。
    归侨们指出，印度尼西亚当局对反华、排华活动中受到迫害的华侨，有责任遣送他们平安回到祖国。一位姓叶的归侨说，我现在还有亲生的儿女在那边不能回来，用起码的人道主义来要求，印度尼西亚当局也是应该负责遣送他们回国的。在印度尼西亚居住五十多年的七十岁归侨陈亚祥说，印度尼西亚有势力集团迫害华侨，造成许多人流离失所，生计无着，就有责任把华侨遣送回国，这样才算尊重两国人民的友谊。
