Xinhua News Agency Report: Hubei Province's ramie planting area this year has expanded nearly twofold compared to last year. All ramie-producing areas are currently carrying out a large-scale, high-yield campaign, earnestly strengthening the management of spring ramie fields. The ramie planted in the Wuhan area this year has generally been weeded once or twice, with 100 to 200 loads of fertilizer applied per mu.

In order to change the phenomenon of low yields in the second and late harvests and strive for balanced production in all three seasons, all ramie-producing areas, based on past experience, have proposed vigorously developing manure storage pits, digging one manure storage pit for every ten to twenty mu of ramie fields, combined with the establishment of pig farms. They require fertilizer application three times each season, namely bud-promoting fertilizer, seedling-strengthening fertilizer, and growth fertilizer. At the same time, they require loosening the soil and weeding three or four times, doing a good job in preventing insects, waterlogging, and wind, vigorously developing irrigation and self-flow in ramie fields, achieving quick stripping, quick cutting of stalks, quick loosening of soil and weeding, and quick topdressing to create conditions for the next season's harvest. Many areas have implemented plans and measures down to the teams and plots. Yangxin, Huangshi, and other places have established specialized teams from top to bottom, led by dedicated personnel in charge of ramie production. Shishou, Jiangling, and other counties have recently held on-site ramie meetings and training courses, training a large number of ramie production experts.

This newspaper reports: Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, a nationally renowned ramie-producing area, under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, is actively developing ramie production in light of local conditions.

The county's ramie planting area this year has increased by more than 7,000 mu compared to last year, and the planned yield per mu is 50 jin higher than last year. In the development of ramie production, there has emerged a contradiction between ramie and grain and cotton for land, fertilizer, and labor. In order to solve these problems, the commune convened a forum of experienced farmers, starting from summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward, and found many effective methods: First, arrange new ramie land in hilly and mountainous areas that are sheltered from the north wind, near mountain nests, and have deep soil layers, to solve the problem of land competition between ramie and cotton. Second, use old ramie plants older than fifteen years to breed new plants. Third, carry out technological innovation to solve the contradiction of insufficient labor.

Currently, the entire county is carrying out a competition to strive for a bumper ramie harvest. Wang Zhongqun, the secretary of the Party branch of the Beifan Brigade of the Xiafan Commune, in order to change the face of low-yield fields, led more than 20 commune members to burn manure on the spot, increasing the amount of warm fertilizer by more than 300 loads per mu. The Dagge Commune has more red soil, so they fixed 110 people to carry mud to Chihu, and 285 mu out of the 325 mu of ramie land in the entire commune were also cultivated with soil, laying the foundation for achieving a bumper ramie harvest.

This newspaper reports: Luzhai County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is vigorously grasping kenaf production. The county has now sown more than 47,000 mu of kenaf, with the planting area expanding three times compared to last year, and the sowing time advanced by 25 to 30 days compared to last year. The land for sowing kenaf has generally been deeply ploughed, the seeds have been selected and disinfected, and sufficient base fertilizer has been applied, achieving rational close planting. Therefore, the emerging kenaf seedlings are robust and have now grown to three or four inches in height.

The Party committees at all levels in the county attach great importance to kenaf production. When they began to rush-plant kenaf this spring, some people thought that the time was still early and they could take their time, while others emphasized that there was insufficient labor and they could not rush-plant it. After mobilizing the commune members to discuss the benefits of early sowing and summarizing past experience, it was clarified that early sowing has three major benefits: First, it can increase production; second, it can avoid the situation where various farm tasks compete for labor during the busy spring plowing season; third, it can take the initiative in work and achieve careful management of various crops. On this basis, the entire county mobilized more than 40,000 people to rush-plant kenaf. Under the leadership of the First Secretary of the Party Committee, the Longcheng Commune organized a total of 4,800 people to carry out a sudden rush-planting, planting a total of 11,000 mu of kenaf, exceeding the planting task by 57%.

In order to strengthen the cultivation and management of kenaf, professional cadres from the County Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau established a 400-mu kenaf demonstration area in the Jiaotong Brigade of the Town Commune. Communes, production brigades, and production teams in all hemp-producing areas are vigorously developing kenaf experimental fields and high-yield plots. The county has successively held three on-site sowing meetings. Through visits, comparisons, and exchanges of production experience, 25,000 mu of hemp fields in the county have been designated as high-yield plots, laying the foundation for a bumper kenaf harvest.

    湖北力争苎麻三季平衡增产
    江西瑞昌扩大苎麻面积　广西鹿寨完成洋麻种植计划
    据新华社讯　湖北省今年苎麻种植面积比去年扩大将近一倍。各产麻地区目前正在开展大面积高产运动，认真加强春季麻田培育管理工作。武汉地区今年种植的苎麻，已经普遍除草一遍到两遍，每亩施肥一百担到二百担。
    为了改变过去二麻、后麻产量低的现象，力争三季平衡增产，各产麻区根据往年经验，都提出大搞粪垱化，每十亩到二十亩麻田挖一个粪垱，结合建立养猪场，要求每季麻施三次肥，即催芽肥、壮苗肥和长肉肥；同时要求松土除草三、四次，做好防虫、防渍、防风工作，大搞麻地灌溉自流化，做到快剥麻，快砍秆，快松土除草，快追肥，为下季丰收创造条件。许多地区都把规划、措施落实到队到地。阳新、黄石等地从上到下都建立专业班子，由专人领导苎麻生产。石首、江陵等县最近还先后召开苎麻现场会议和训练班，训练大批苎麻生产能手。
    本报讯　全国著名的苎麻产地——江西省瑞昌县，在以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针指导下，因地制宜地积极发展苎麻生产。
    这个县今年种植苎麻的面积比去年增加了七千多亩，计划亩产量比去年提高五十斤。在发展苎麻生产上，出现了苎麻与粮、棉争地、争肥、争劳力的矛盾。为了解决这些问题，公社召开了老农座谈会，从总结大跃进的经验入手，找到了很多有效的办法：一、将新麻地安排在避北风、靠山窝、土层深厚的丘陵山地，解决麻棉争地的问题。二、利用十五年以上的老麻繁殖。三、开展技术革新，解决劳力不足的矛盾。
    目前全县正在开展争取苎麻大丰收的竞赛，夏畈公社北畈大队党支部书记王忠群，为了改变低产田的面貌，带领二十多名社员就地烧火粪，每亩地增加了暖性肥料三百多担。大格公社红壤土较多，他们便固定了一百一十人到赤湖挑泥，全社三百二十五亩麻地，也有二百八十五亩培了土，为实现苎麻丰收打下了基础。
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区鹿寨县大抓洋麻生产，全县现已播种洋麻四万七千多亩，种植面积比去年扩大了三倍，播种时间比去年提早了二十五天到三十天。播种洋麻的土地普遍经过深耕，种子经过选种消毒，施足基肥，做到了合理密植，因此，出土的麻苗茁壮，现已长到三、四寸高。
    这个县的各级党委都很重视洋麻生产，今春开始抢种洋麻时，有的人认为时间还早，可以慢慢来，有的人强调劳动力不足，抢种不过来。经过发动社员讨论提早播种的好处和总结了往年的经验，明确了早播种有三大好处：一、可以增产；二、可以避免春耕大忙时节各项农活争劳力的情况；三、在工作上争取主动，可以做到精心管理各项农作物。在这个基础上，全县调动了四万多人抢种洋麻，龙城公社在党委第一书记的带动下，全社共组织四千八百多人突击抢种，共种洋麻一万一千亩，超额57％完成了种植任务。
    为了加强洋麻的培育管理，县农牧局的专业干部在城镇公社交通大队搞了四百亩洋麻的示范区。各麻区公社、生产大队、生产小队都大搞洋麻试验田、丰产片。县里先后召开了三次播种现场会议，通过参观评比、交流生产经验，全县有二万五千亩麻田划为丰产片，为洋麻大丰收奠定了基础。（附图片）
