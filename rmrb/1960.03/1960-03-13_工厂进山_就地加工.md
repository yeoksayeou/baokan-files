	Factories Enter the Mountains, Processing On-Site

	Our country's vast forests are distributed in remote mountainous areas, with long distances and inconvenient transportation, creating difficulties for the large-scale increase in timber production. The main method to solve this contradiction is to build timber processing plants and forest chemical plants in forest areas, shipping less raw wood and more finished wood. This not only saves transportation capacity and increases timber production but also fully utilizes many logging residues (roots, branches, leaves, and diseased and rotten wood), improves the utilization rate of forest resources, and increases the production of a large amount of timber and other forest products for the country.

	Factories entering the mountains, taking materials locally, processing them on-site, and then transporting finished and semi-finished products out of the mountains can greatly increase the loading capacity and save transportation capacity. According to statistics, a thirty-ton wagon can only load thirty cubic meters of raw wood, but it can load forty-five cubic meters of finished wood. Raw wood is transported from the forest area to large cities and must be processed before it can be used. Generally, the material yield of mixed processing of first-class and second-class materials does not exceed 75%. After thirty cubic meters of raw wood is processed, there are only twenty-two and a half cubic meters of finished wood. Calculated in this way, if two wagons of raw wood are transported from the forest area, one wagon can transport it out if it is processed into finished wood on the spot.

	Generally, units that need wood do not have wood processing plants, and they have to entrust nearby sawmills to process it. The general sawmills in large and medium-sized cities are small in scale, scattered in locations, and do not have dedicated line equipment. Therefore, after the wood-needing units transport the raw wood from the forest area, they must use trucks, animal-drawn vehicles, or human-powered vehicles to transport the raw wood from the railway station to the processing plant. After processing, the finished wood is transported to the construction site or the location where production is needed. This transshipment not only increases the burden on wood-needing units but also causes tension in urban short-distance transportation.

	Sawing wood in or near forest areas is an effective measure to comprehensively utilize wood, improve wood utilization, and increase wood production. Because establishing comprehensive processing enterprises in raw material bases can fully utilize the endless resources in forest areas; and combine the raw material situation and the needs of wood-needing units to rationally match the use of wood, so that large materials are used for large purposes, and small materials are used for small purposes. The remaining waste materials and shavings can also be used to manufacture various artificial boards and other forest products. Otherwise, transporting raw wood from the forest area thousands of miles to decentralized processing locations will inevitably lead to waste of wood. For example, some units only want long and large materials, not small and short materials, but in the process of processing raw wood, in addition to producing some long and large materials, many small and short materials will inevitably be produced. Conversely, some wood-needing units want to manufacture small wooden products, but what they receive are long and large raw wood, so they have to use large materials for small purposes, sawing large into small, and cutting long into short. In addition, setting up processing plants in forest areas can not only process raw wood, but also utilize a large amount of logging residues. Every blade of grass, every tree, every flower, and every fruit on the mountain are raw materials for production, and can be used to manufacture various artificial boards and valuable products such as rosin, tannin extract, pine needle oil, and camphor oil. If it can be processed on the spot, the country's forest resources can be fully utilized.

	Sawing wood in forest areas is of great benefit to the development of forestry production or supporting national construction. In the past year, many forest areas have developed the timber processing industry. Provinces and regions such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia have also moved thirty-four urban sawmill teams into the forest area, greatly increasing the forest area's sawing capacity. This is a good start and needs to continue to work hard in the future to increase the production of more timber and other forest products for the country. (Lin Jian)

    工厂进山　就地加工
    我国的大森林，都分布在偏远的山区，路途遥远，交通不便，给大量增产木材造成了困难。解决这个矛盾的主要方法，就是在林区兴建木材加工厂和林产化学工厂，少往外运原木，多往外运成材。这样不仅可以节省运输力，增加木材生产，而且可以把许多采伐剩余物（树根、枝桠、树叶以及病腐木等）充分利用起来，提高森林资源的利用率，为国家增产大量的木材和其它林产品。
    工厂进山，就地取材，就地加工，然后向山外运输成材和半成品，可以大大提高装载量，节约运输力。据统计，一个三十吨的车皮，装原木只能装载三十立方米，装成材可装四十五立方米。原木由林区运到大城市后，要经过加工才能使用。一般等内、等外材混合加工，出材率最多不超过75％。三十立方米原木加工后，只有二十二点五立方米成材。这样计算起来，从林区运出两车皮原木，如果就地加工成材，有一个车皮就可运出。
    一般需用木材的单位，大多数没有木材加工厂，要委托附近制材加工厂加工。各大、中城市一般的制材厂，都是规模小、厂址分散，没有专用线设备。因此，需用木材单位从林区运来原木后，必须由车站货物线上用汽车、畜力车或人力车把原木运到加工厂。加工后，再把成材运到工地或生产需要的地点。这样辗转搬运，不仅增加了需材单位的负担，而且造成城市短途运输的紧张。
    在林区或靠近林区制材，是木材综合利用，提高木材利用率，增加木材产量的有效措施。因为在原料基地建立综合性的加工企业，可以充分利用林区里无穷无尽的资源；并结合原料情况和需材单位的要求，合理搭配使用木材，做到大材大用，小材小用。对剩余废材碎料，还可以用来制造各种人造板及其它林产品。否则，把原木由林区千里迢迢运到使用地点分散加工，必然出现浪费木材的现象。如有的单位只要长材大料，不要小材短料，但原木在加工过程中，除了制出一些长材大料外，还必然带出很多小材短料。相反地，有的需材单位要制造小件木制品，而所领的又是长原木、大原木，只好大材小用，将大锯小，将长截短。此外，在林区里搞加工厂不但可以加工原木，同时还能把大量的采伐剩余物利用起来。山上的一草一木、一花一果都是生产原料，可以制造各种人造板以及松香、栲胶、松针油、樟木油等贵重的产品。如果能够就地加工，那就能对国家的森林资源充分地利用起来。
    在林区里制材，无论对发展林业生产，或支援国家各项建设，都有莫大的好处。一年来，好多林区发展了木材加工工业，黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古等省区，还将三十四个城市制材工组搬进林区，大大地增加了林区制材能力。这是一个良好的开端，有待今后继续努力，为国家增产更多的木材和其它林产品。（林　间）
