Nanchong Broadly Opens Up Spring Feed Sources
    This newspaper reports that Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, mobilized the masses to broadly open up feed sources, ensuring that more than 90% of the county's management areas have sufficient spring feed.
    With the great development of pig raising, Nanchong County needs about 40% more spring feed this year than in the same period last year. The Nanchong County Party Committee led the people of the county to launch a mass movement to broadly find spring feed. The specific methods are: First, vigorously collect wild green feed. The county organized more than 100,000 people to carry out a "one person, one handful of grass" movement during rest time. In this way, 6 to 7 million jin of green feed can be collected every day. Second, vigorously develop processed feed. Each commune uses existing sweet potato leaves, sweet potato vines, sweet potato sprouts, corn leaves, corn stalks, corn cobs, sorghum stalks, sorghum leaves, bean stalks, bean leaves, bean pods, grain husks, and rice straw, etc., as raw materials for pig feed, except for the part left for cattle to eat. Each of the county's more than 3,000 pig farms has a processing plant. According to incomplete statistics, the county can process about 200,000 jin of fragrant dry feed every day. Third, develop aquatic feed. At present, all the reservoirs, ponds, and weirs in the county with water have planted aquatic feed. These aquatic feeds can be harvested once a month in spring, summer, and autumn, and each mu of water surface can yield more than 10,000 jin of green feed per month. Fourth, strengthen field management of feed land and increase the yield per unit area. All localities have strengthened the management of feed land in a timely manner according to the principle of "special person, special land, special fertilizer." Although they have suffered from winter drought and spring drought, the feed yield has not been affected. Currently, kohlrabi, cabbage, broad beans, barley, oats, etc. are growing very well.
    Currently, commune members are actively intercropping spring feed; at the same time, they are applying top dressing to strive for high yields and more harvests.

    南充广辟春饲料来源
    本报讯　四川省南充县发动群众广辟饲料来源，保证了全县90％以上的管理区有充足的春季饲料。
    随着养猪的大发展，南充县今年需要的春季饲料比去年同期增加了40％左右。南充县委领导全县人民，展开了广找春季饲料的群众运动。具体办法是：一、大力采集野生青饲料。全县共组织了十万多人，利用休息时间，开展了一人一把草运动。这样，每天可采集青饲料六、七百万斤。二、大搞加工饲料。各公社把现存的红苕叶、红苕藤、红苕鼻子、玉米叶、玉米秆、玉米心、高粱秆、高粱叶、豆秆、豆叶、豆壳、谷壳和稻草等，除留给牛吃部分外，都作为猪饲料的原料。全县三千多个猪场，每个场都有加工厂。据不完全统计，全县每天约可加工出二十万斤香喷喷的干饲料。三、发展水生饲料。目前，全县有水的库、塘、堰一般都种植了水生饲料。这些水生饲料，在春、夏、秋三季每月可收获一次，每亩水面每月可收获青饲料一万多斤。四、加强饲料地的田间管理，提高单位面积产量。各地按专人、专地、专肥料的原则，及时加强了饲料地的管理，虽然遭到冬旱和春旱，饲料产量仍没有受到影响，目前牛皮菜、莲花白、胡豆、大麦、燕麦等长得很好。
    当前各公社社员正积极套种春季饲料；同时大施追肥，争取高产多收。
