Looking at Comprehensive Utilization from Two Products
Shanghai Taishan Organic Chemical Factory Chen Renzhi

Starting with Numbers
Currently, the consumption of raw materials for many chemical products is very high, especially in the organic chemical industry. Taking several major products of the pharmaceutical industry as examples, producing one ton of chloramphenicol requires 63 tons of raw materials, one ton of sulfathiazole requires 13.3 tons of raw materials, one ton of isoniazid requires more than 11 tons of raw materials, one ton of aspirin requires 17.7 tons of raw materials, and one ton of saccharin requires 10.5 tons of raw materials.

A large number of by-products produced in chemical industrial production, along with some solvents that do not participate in the reaction, are generally called "waste materials." However, from a chemical point of view, there is no waste in the world. However, it just so happens that in our chemical factories, tons, dozens of tons, or even hundreds of tons of valuable raw materials are turned into "waste gas," "waste liquid," and "waste materials" every day, running away from the sky, from the ground, and from the hands of us chemical workers. Isn't this a very regrettable thing?

Two Different Approaches
Regarding "waste materials," some people (including many insiders) believe that "waste materials" are always "waste materials," and no matter how hard you try, you can't make a big deal out of them. Plus, they are troublesome to handle, and it's not worth "making a fuss about." Therefore, they only passively think about how to destroy these waste materials. They spent several thousand yuan to build a waste water neutralization pool, and every day they used several laborers and a lot of lime to treat the waste water. But the waste water became more and more, and neither manpower nor material resources could cope with it. Some people also came up with a way to bury p-toluenesulfonyl chloride alive in a large pit, thinking that once it was buried in the ground, it would be safe. Who knew that it would continue to decompose underground, and the acid liquid would seep out, causing the surrounding plants to wither and the pipes to corrode. After a while, the ground would collapse with a bang.

However, what more people are thinking is: since chemistry does not recognize waste, wouldn't it be a violation of science and a waste of national resources if we call these originally useful things "waste materials" and try every means to destroy them? The Party branch supported this opinion and proposed to make large-scale comprehensive utilization and recycling one of the central contents of the technological revolution, and demanded that "no waste gas in the sky, no waste materials on the ground, and no waste liquid underground" be basically realized in 1959, so that everything is used to its fullest extent and waste materials become treasures.

Turning Losses into "Freebies"
Thanks to the active efforts of all the workers in the factory, great achievements have been made in comprehensive utilization. Taking saccharin and aspirin as examples: producing one ton of saccharin using the toluene chlorosulfonation method requires 10.5 tons of raw materials. Now, the products and by-products that have been recovered account for 71.7% of the input raw materials, the unrecovered part accounts for 8.7%, the water generated in the reaction accounts for 6.9%, and other consumption accounts for 4.7%. Among the eleven types of by-products that should be recovered, nine types have been recovered, except for salt and carbon dioxide. Among them, four types can be made into another fifteen products, including dichloral acrylic acid, a raw material for manufacturing sulfadiazine, and manganese carbonate, an important raw material for the telecommunications industry for manufacturing electronic computers and carrier wave machines. The other types are also urgently needed materials in the market, such as high-grade preservatives, raw materials for color films, and reagents. Taking the production of 100 tons of saccharin as an example, the total factory cost of saccharin is 2.5 million yuan, while the output value of its by-products after comprehensive utilization reaches 3.43 million yuan, and the profit reaches 2.57 million yuan. The profit from comprehensive utilization of by-products offsets the cost of saccharin, making it a freebie with a surplus. Through comprehensive utilization, a large amount of waste gas, waste liquid, and waste materials have been put to proper use. Costs have been reduced, labor protection issues have been resolved, and production has also been improved.

Take aspirin as another example. Aspirin is a very old, common, and simple antipyretic drug. Over the past decade since liberation, China's pharmaceutical industry has developed greatly, and many of the newest, most advanced, and complex drugs have been produced in large quantities. But no one makes aspirin, and we have always relied on foreign imports, which has made imperialist countries laugh at us. Why doesn't anyone make it? One of the reasons is that the output value is small, the cost is high, and the losses are very large. Starting from benzene, it takes 17.7 tons of raw materials to make one ton of aspirin, and the factory cost is 15,700 yuan, but the output value is only 5,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 10,700 yuan. Through comprehensive utilization, we recovered 7.5 tons, which, together with the product, accounts for 48% of the input raw materials, with a value of 90,000 yuan. Recovering glacial acetic acid to make the plant growth regulator sodium naphthylacetate or 2,4-D alone is worth 87,000 yuan. The output value has increased by about 18 times, turning a large loss into a large profit, which not only protects the people's health but also supports the great leap forward in agriculture. Aspirin itself has also become a "freebie" product.

The facts show that comprehensive utilization and recycling are not "making a fuss about," but are full of potential.

    从两个产品看综合利用
    上海泰山有机化工厂　陈任之
    从数字谈起
    现在很多化工产品的原材料消耗量很大，尤其在有机化学工业中更为突出。以医药工业的几种主要产品为例，制造一吨合霉素要六十三吨原料，制造一吨磺胺噻唑要十三点三吨原料，制造一吨异烟肼要十一吨多原料，制造一吨阿斯匹林要十七点七吨原料，制造一吨糖精要十吨半原料。
    在化学工业生产中产生的大量副产品连同一些不参加反应的溶剂等等，一般被我们称为“下脚废料”。但是从化学的观点来看，世界上根本没有废物。然而恰好在我们这些化工厂里，每天几吨、几十吨，甚至几百吨宝贵的原材料变成了“废气”“废液”“废料”，从天上，从地下，从我们这些化学工作者的手里跑掉了。这不是一件很可惋惜的事情吗？
    两种不同的做法
    对于“下脚废料”，有些人（其中包括很多内行）认为，“下脚废料”总是“下脚废料”，再卖力也做不出大文章来，加上处理起来又麻烦，不值得“小题大做”。因此只是消极的动脑筋，怎样把这些废料销毁了事。花了几千元钱搞了一个废水中和池，每天用几个劳动力和很多石灰来处理废水。但是废水越来越多，无论人力、物力都无法招架。也有人想了个办法，挖个大坑，把对甲苯磺醯氯活埋，以为这一入了土就安全了。谁知它在地下继续分解，酸液渗透出去照样使周围植物枯萎，管道腐蚀，日子稍久，这块地就轰的一下塌陷了。
    但是，更多人所想的却是：既然从化学的观点不承认世界上有废物，那么我们把这些本来有用的东西叫做“下脚废料”，千方百计把它销毁掉，岂不是违反科学、浪费国家的物资吗？党支部支持这种意见，提出要把大搞综合利用、回收利用作为技术革命的中心内容之一，并且要求在1959年内基本上实现“天上无废气，地上无废料，地下无废液”，使物尽其用，废料成宝。
    赔本变“白吃”
    由于全厂职工积极努力，在综合利用方面取得了很大成绩。以糖精和阿斯匹林为例：用甲苯氯磺酸法生产糖精一吨，要用原料十吨半，现在已经回收的产品和副产品占投入原料的71．7％，尚未回收部分占8．7％，反应中生成的水占6．9％，其他消耗4．7％。在应该回收的十一种副产品中，除食盐和二氧化碳外，已经回收了九种。其中四种又可以制成另外十五种产品，包括制造磺胺嘧啶的原料二氯醛基丙烯酸，以及制造电子计算机、载波机的电讯工业重要原料碳酸锰等。其他几种也是市场迫切需要的物资，如高级防腐剂、五彩影片原料和试剂等。以制造一百吨糖精计算，糖精的全部工厂成本为二百五十万元，而它的副产品经过综合利用，产值达到三百四十三万元，利润达到二百五十七万元。副产品综合利用的利润和糖精成本相抵，是白吃糖精还有盈余。通过综合利用大量废气、废液、废料大都派了正当用场。成本降低了，劳动保护问题解决了，生产也提高了。
    再以阿斯匹林为例。阿斯匹林是一个很老的、普通的而且工艺过程很简单的解热药。解放十年来，我国医药工业有了很大的发展，很多最新的、高级的、复杂的药品都已大量生产。但就是阿斯匹林没人做，一直依赖国外进口，使得帝国主义国家嘲笑我们。为什么没人做呢？原因之一就是产值小，成本高，亏损很大。从苯开始做成一吨阿斯匹林要用十七点七吨原料，工厂成本是一万五千七百元，但产值仅五千元，亏损一万零七百元。通过综合利用，我们回收了七吨半，连同产品共为投入原料的48％，价值九万元，单回收冰醋酸制成植物刺激素萘乙酸钠或2．4D就值八万七千元，产值增长了约十八倍，从大亏损变为大盈余，既保障了人民的健康，又支援了农业大跃进，阿斯匹林本身也就变成“白吃”产品了。
    事实说明：综合利用和回收利用不是“小题大做”，而是大有可为。
