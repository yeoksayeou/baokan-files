Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 16th: Shanghai factories and enterprises are providing large-scale technical support to rural areas in the suburbs. A support team of more than a thousand workers has recently arrived in rural areas one after another to work alongside farmers in innovating production technology. The spearhead of innovation is currently aimed at pig-raising tools, with a plan to change the technical face of the pig-raising front in the suburbs in a short period of time to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry.

The technical support of factories and enterprises to the suburbs is carried out under the direct leadership and organization of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. In the past, Shanghai factories and enterprises often sent workers to the countryside to repair agricultural tools and impart technology, and have always had close ties with rural areas. In January of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made further arrangements to strengthen leadership over this work. According to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, twelve districts in the city organized visiting groups composed of technical workers of various types during the Spring Festival, combined with technical support activities, to visit the rural areas of eleven suburban counties for about a week. The district groups widely held discussions with rural cadres, commune members, and workers of commune-run factories to understand the needs of the countryside and prepare for the launch of large-scale technical support activities. On this basis, each district formulated a support plan, with districts and counties paired up, and 492 factories in each district paired up with people's communes in each county, dividing up the work and taking responsibility to the end, determining a focus for each period, and carrying out long-term and continuous technical support activities to the suburbs from helping rural areas carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, repairing agricultural machinery, installing machinery and equipment, and cultivating technical forces.

Shanghai workers, full of enthusiasm to support their farmer brothers, have rapidly developed the reform of pig-raising tools in a short period of time after going to the countryside. According to preliminary statistics, they have manufactured and modified more than 300 pieces of pig-raising tools. From feed cutting and crushing, water lifting in farms, pig feed transportation, and stove blowing to manure transportation, various high-efficiency pig-raising tools have emerged simultaneously. An electric and foot-operated dual-purpose feed cutter manufactured by workers in the Wusong District can cut both vegetable and root feeds, and the efficiency is more than 40 times higher than manual work when using electricity. Workers in the Zhabei District manufactured a cake feed crusher that can crush 3,000 catties of bean cake per hour, which is 50 to 60 times more efficient than manual crushing. A hand-cranked water pump manufactured by workers in the Jing'an District uses only one large and one small bamboo, one piece of rubber, and one small wooden frame, and can draw about three loads of water per minute from a depth of more than ten feet, which is suitable for small and decentralized pig farms.

In the previous period, farm tool factories in various people's communes in the suburbs had already produced a large number of pig-raising tools. Now, with the enthusiastic help of the workers who have gone to the countryside, the design has been improved, and the efficiency of some tools has been doubled. During this period, the workers who went to the countryside also manufactured stoves for burning pig feed with high efficiency and low coal consumption for rural areas, designed a gravity-flow water system for the entire pig farm, and modified threshing machines, cotton gins, and other agricultural tools for feed cutting. The modified threshing machines and cotton gins can still be used for threshing and cotton ginning as long as the rollers are replaced. The success of this modification has found a solution to the feed cutting problem in the cotton and rice producing areas of the suburbs.

While concentrating the main force on reforming pig-raising tools, Shanghai workers who have gone to the countryside are also carrying out technical support activities in many aspects of rural areas. In the previous period, the rapidly developing suburbs of Shanghai had successively added a large amount of mechanical equipment, and the repair and installation forces could not keep up for a while; the workers who went to the countryside brought tools with them to repair water pumps and tractors for the communes in the fields, and went to the commune farm tool factories to assist in the installation of machine tools. Some communes needed to install a complete set of equipment in newly built factories, and the workers also went to the site to guide the entire process. According to Jing'an District statistics alone, workers who have gone to the countryside have repaired and installed more than 20 pieces of water pumps, lathes, and generators for the communes. Workers from various districts also widely went to the commune's mechanical processing plants and farm tool manufacturing plants to perform operations, introduce advanced experience, and impart technology in many ways.

After the workers of various factories and enterprises went to the countryside, they showed the excellent qualities of the working class, such as selflessness and selfless labor, which gave the farmers a great education. The prosperous and thriving scene of the countryside after the communization and the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of the farmers also gave the workers great encouragement.

    上海千余工人结队下乡
    支援农民革新养猪工具改进生产技术
    据新华社上海16日电　上海工厂企业大规模地以技术支援郊区农村。一支由一千多工人组成的支援队伍，最近陆续到达农村，同农民并肩革新生产技术。革新矛头当前首先指向养猪工具，计划在短时期内改变郊区养猪战线的技术面貌，适应养猪事业高速度发展的需要。
    工厂企业对郊区的技术支援，是在中共上海市委直接领导和组织下进行的。上海工厂企业过去也常派工人下乡修理农具、传授技术，历来和农村有密切联系。今年1月份，中共上海市委作了进一步的部署，加强对这一工作的领导。市内十二个区根据市委指示，春节期间分别组织有各工种技术工人参加的访问小组，结合技术支援活动，到郊区十一个县农村作为时一周左右的访问。各区小组广泛同农村干部、公社社员和社办工厂工人座谈，了解农村需要，为大规模技术支援活动的展开作好准备。在这一基础上，各区分别订出支援规划，区与县对口挂钩，各区四百九十二个工厂和各县人民公社挂钩，分片包干，负责到底，确定一个时期一个中心，从帮助农村进行技术革新和技术革命、修理农业机具、安装机器设备、培养技术力量等方面，对郊区展开长期的持续的技术支援活动。
    满腔热情支援农民兄弟的上海工人，下乡后短短时间内，就使养猪工具改革迅速发展。据初步统计，他们制造、改装的养猪工具已在三百件以上。从饲料切割和粉碎、饲养场提水、猪食运输、锅灶鼓风一直到粪便输送，各种高效率的养猪工具已同时涌现出来。吴淞区工人制造的一台电动、脚踏两用饲料切割机，能兼切菜类和根块饲料，电动时工效比人工提高四十倍以上。闸北区工人制造出一台饼类饲料粉碎机，每小时能粉碎豆饼三千斤，比人工粉碎效率提高五十到六十倍。静安区工人制造的一种手摇吸水机，制造时只用大小毛竹各一根、橡皮一片、小木架一只，每分钟可从一丈多深处吸水三担左右，适合小型、分散的养猪场的需要。
    郊区各人民公社农具厂前一时期已制成大批养猪工具，现在在下乡工人热情帮助下，改进设计，使有些工具的效率成倍提高。这一时期，下乡工人们并为农村制造效率高、耗煤量少的烧猪食的锅灶，设计整个养猪场的用水自流化系统，改装脱粒、轧棉等农具用作饲料切割。改装后的脱粒机和轧棉机，只要掉换滚筒，仍可继续作脱粒、轧棉之用。这一改装成功，为郊区棉稻产区的饲料切割问题找到了一个解决途径。
    在集中主要力量改革养猪工具的同时，上海下乡工人也展开对农村多方面的技术支援活动。生产高速发展的上海市郊农村，前一时期陆续添置了大量机械设备，修理、安装力量一时跟不上；下乡工人就随带工具，在田头为公社检修水泵、拖拉机，到公社农具厂协助安装机床。有的公社新建工厂需要安装整套设备，工人也自始至终到现场指导。仅据静安区统计，下乡工人为公社修理和安装的水泵、车床、发电机等已有二十多件。各区工人还广泛地到公社的机械加工厂、农具制造厂表演操作，介绍先进经验，多方面传授技术。
    各工厂企业工人下乡后，表现出了大公无私、忘我劳动的工人阶级优秀品质，给农民以很大教育。公社化后农村的一片兴旺繁荣景象和农民空前高涨的生产热情，也给工人们很大鼓舞。
