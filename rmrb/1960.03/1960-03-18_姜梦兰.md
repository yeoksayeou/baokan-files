I met Jiang Menglan in the winter of 1945, the first winter after the liberation of Liuzhuang. Liuzhuang was a village by the river and near the swamp, often plagued by floods before liberation, making it impossible to cultivate the land. The people here relied on fishing and weaving mats to make a living. As soon as liberation came, the leadership sent me to this village for disaster relief. Introduced by the village cadres, the first household I visited was Jiang Menglan's family.

Snow was falling, and the northeast wind was blowing like knives. In a dilapidated courtyard without a gate near the village, there were two west-facing rooms that were about to collapse. The various colored papers pasted on the doors and windows were torn by the wind, and the wind howled inside. In the outer room, a disheveled woman was weaving a mat on the floor. I greeted her and walked in, but she only answered a couple of questions briefly before lowering her head again, concentrating on her weaving. "Is this Liu Changshun's home?" I wondered to myself. When I asked about her husband's name, she blushed as she answered, and I realized that she was a young woman in her twenties. Her face was very proper, but she was very thin. Her uncombed hair was like a pile of rotten grass, and her two frostbitten hands were swollen like mushrooms. She was wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket, and a child less than a year old was lying on her lap, crying incessantly. I advised her, "Sister-in-law, coax him and then weave!"

"Oh! What else can I do if I don't weave? Five people are waiting to eat!" Then she began to tell me about her family: a family of five, with only Liu Changshun being the mainstay; the two elders were both over sixty years old, the father-in-law was blind and unable to do anything, and the mother-in-law was paralyzed and bedridden all year round. She was Changshun's main helper, while also taking care of a child less than a year old. In the old society, they had nothing. Since she married into the family, she had never had a full meal, and on the day she gave birth to this child, she got out of bed and wove a mat. After I understood her family's situation, I quickly went back to discuss it with the village cadres and provided her family with 200 catties of millet as relief. I stayed in the village for half a month, helping the village to arrange production, and then left.

The second time I visited Jiang Menglan was in the summer of 1955, because she had set a record of weaving three mats a day and was selected to attend the county's production model meeting. I was there to summarize her experience.

The willows swayed gently, and the breeze caressed my face. The milky white Daqing River flowed slowly eastward. North of the embankment was a large reed field, stretching as far as the eye could see; south of the embankment was a lush green sea of rice, exceptionally pleasing. I slowed my pace, enjoying the beautiful scenery as I walked. Suddenly, a melodious song floated from the trees near the village: "The low-lying land has a great harvest, every month is like autumn throughout the year..." Interspersed with the laughter of women. I curiously followed the sound of the song.

Wow! It turned out to be a mat-weaving field. Looking carefully through the tall trees, it was full of people weaving mats. The tall trees were like huge natural umbrellas, forming a great cool shed. The mat weavers were gathered in groups of three or two under the trees, busy at work.

When a little girl led me to Jiang Menglan, I was stunned and couldn't recognize her. She was very different from before. Her face was round and plump, with a rosy glow. She had short hair cut to her neck, and wore a light pink short-sleeved jacket. Although she was ten years older, her expression was more lively than before. When she saw me, she warmly took my hand and asked about everything, talking non-stop. She told me about the changes in her family over the past ten years: now their village had established a large cooperative, her husband Changshun was the production team leader, and she herself was the leader of the mat-weaving team. Also, she had two more children, the eldest son was eleven years old and in school; the younger daughter was five years old and playing on her own; the youngest had just celebrated her first birthday and was in the temporary nursery of their cooperative. Their cooperative had a very good harvest last year, and the income from sideline occupations was also very high. Although it was still the two of them working, the work points they earned were more than enough for the whole family to eat and use. Finally, she stopped smiling and said solemnly:

"It's a pity that both my parents-in-law are gone. If they were still alive, they would be so happy!" Then she happily said:

"Everything is so satisfactory now, there's nothing to worry about. There's only one thing, that is, the two children are a handful. Besides taking care of them, I have to cook three meals a day. If there were a canteen, that would be great. I could weave more mats!"

"You really are, still thinking about eating in a canteen!" a middle-aged woman interrupted.

"The better it is, the better I want it!" She asked me, "Do you think that time will come?" Everyone laughed heartily at her question.

This was the third time I had visited Jiang Menglan. "This woman is really energetic! Weaving five mats a day! I wonder how she has changed again?" I thought as I got on my bicycle.

Arriving at the seventh workshop of the mat-weaving processing factory of the Satellite Commune, I found Jiang Menglan. A row of five interconnected new rooms, spacious and bright, with five coal stoves burning in the middle, the fire burning brightly. On a table against the wall was a five-tube radio, playing a piece of light music. On the floor, two rows of ten people sat facing each other on white reed mats, heads down, weaving intently. The soft reed strips moved back and forth in their arms like shuttles, no one looking up, what an intense scene! I asked the little girl next to me who was watching the time, and learned that they were having a competition. I didn't want to disturb them, so I stood aside and watched. Isn't that Jiang Menglan weaving the fastest against the north wall? Look how skillful her two hands are, almost flying, weaving a large piece in no time! "Jiang Menglan, one minute and twenty-five seconds!" Hearing the little girl's shout, I saw her smiling, lifting her head, letting out a long sigh, and standing up.

"So fast!" I couldn't help but exclaim. She suddenly noticed me: "Oh! It's you!"

The competition was over, and the bell rang in the canteen. She pulled me to her house, insisting that I eat at her house. I said, "Don't you eat in the canteen? Didn't you want a canteen a long time ago?"

"Yes. But since we have a guest today, let's take the food back and eat here. I'll get you some good dishes, you wait! I'll call him back to eat too. You don't come easily..." Saying that, she pushed me onto the kang and ran out. At this time, sitting on the edge of the kang, I noticed the furnishings in her room: these were three newly built main rooms, with snow-white walls and a large floral ceiling; against the north wall was a red lacquer cabinet, on which was placed a double-bell horseshoe clock, a crystal radio, and in the middle was a large framed picture, inside which were photos of their family and a certificate of merit, and looking up, there was a portrait of Chairman Mao. The room was tidied up very neatly and beautifully! It really didn't look like a family with four children.

In a little while, both of them came back, each carrying a lunch box. Liu Changshun shouted as soon as he entered the yard, "Has Comrade Wang arrived?" I quickly greeted him, and he took my hand and said, "Quick! Why haven't you come these past few years? Come in and sit!"

"Where are the children?" I asked, noticing that there were only three of us as we started to eat.

"They don't eat at home. Those who are going to school eat at school, and those who are going to kindergarten eat at kindergarten. They don't come back until dark," Jiang Menglan replied with a smile. "If it weren't for collectivization and the establishment of canteens and nurseries, how could I weave five mats a day? I couldn't handle these four children, let alone work!" She smiled so happily, even younger than when I first met her.

    姜梦兰

    我认识姜梦兰还是在1945年冬天，流庄解放后的第一个冬天。流庄是个靠河临淀的村子，解放前常闹水患，种不上地，这里的群众就靠打鱼、织席维持生活。刚一解放，领导上就派我到这村来救灾。经过村干部的介绍，我访问的头一户就是姜梦兰她家。
    天上下着小雪，刮着小刀子似的东北风。靠村边的一个没有大门的破院子里，有两间快要倒塌的西房。门窗上糊着的各色各样的纸，都被风吹破了，呼呼地往里灌风。外屋的地上，一个蓬头垢面的女人正在织席。我招呼了一声走进去，她只简单地答了两句问话，便又低下头，专心地织她的席。“这是刘常顺家吗？”我暗自怀疑着。当我问到她丈夫的名字，她红着脸答话的时候，我这才看清了她是个二十来岁的年青媳妇。脸庞长得很端正，只是很瘦，没有梳过的头发，乱蓬蓬的像烂草堆，两只冻裂的手，肿的像蘑菇。上身穿着一件破飞了花的棉袄，一个不满一岁的小孩趴在她的腿上，一个劲地哭。我就劝她：“大嫂子，哄哄他再织吧！”
    “咳！不织怎么着？五口人等着吃呢！”接着她就说起她的这个家来：一家五口，只有刘常顺是个顶事的，打冬网去了；两个老人都六十多了，公公是个瞎子，干不了事，婆婆是半身不遂，整年在炕上躺着。她就是常顺的一个主要帮手，还弄着个不满一岁的孩子。旧社会里他们一无所有。从她过门来就没吃过一顿饱饭，生这个孩子的时候，当天就下炕织了一片席。我了解清了她家的情况，忙回去和村干部研究，赈了她家二百斤小米。我在这村住了半月，帮助村里安排了生产，就离开了。
    第二次访问姜梦兰是在1955年的夏天，因为她创造了一天织三片席的纪录，被选为出席县的生产模范，我是去总结她的经验的。
    杨柳轻扬，和风拂面。乳白色的大清河水缓缓地向东流着，堤北是大片的苇田，一眼望不到边；堤南是一片葱绿的稻海，分外喜人。我放慢了脚步边走边欣赏这美好的景色，忽然一阵悦耳的歌声从村边的树丛中飘过来：“洼地大丰收哇，一年月月秋，……”间或掺杂着妇女的笑声。我好奇地顺歌声走去。
    嗬！原来是一个织席场。透过高大的树身仔细看去，里边尽是织席的。高高的大树像是一把把巨大的天然伞，搭成了一个很好的大凉棚。织席的人们，仨一群，俩一伙的凑在树下忙着。
    当一个小姑娘领我见到姜梦兰时，我不由一楞，怎么也不敢认她了。她和以前大不一样了，脸儿圆圆的、胖胖的，透着红润，剪着齐脖颈的短头发，穿着一件浅粉色短袖小褂，年纪虽然长了十岁，神情倒比以前活泼了，见了我就亲热的拉着手问长问短，说起话来没有完。她告诉我她家这十年间的变化：现在她们村已成立了全村的大合作社，她的丈夫常顺当了生产队长，她自己是织席组的组长。还有，她又添了两个孩子，那个大小子十一岁了，上了学；一个小闺女五岁，自己跑着玩去了；最小的才过第一个生日，在他们社的临时托儿组里。他们社去年收成很好，副业收入也很多，虽然还是她们两口子干活，得的工分一家子是吃用不完的。末后她收住笑脸沉重地说：“可惜就是公公婆婆都不在了，他们要活到现在，不定把俩老人乐成个什么样呢！”紧接着她又高兴地说：
    “这时候什么都称心如意，发愁的事没有了。只有一样，就是两个孩子累手，除了照顾他们，每天还得自己做三顿饭。要是有个食堂就好了。我还能多织些席哩！”
    “你真是，还想吃食堂！”旁边一个中年媳妇插嘴说。
    “越好越想好呗！”她问我说：“你说能有那时候吗？”问的大家都哈哈地笑起来了。
    这是第三次去访姜梦兰了。“这个妇女干劲真大呀！一天织五片席！她这个人，不知道又变得什么样了呢？”一跨上自行车，我就这样想着。
    来到卫星公社织席加工厂第七车间，我找到了姜梦兰。一扯五间通的新房，宽敞明亮，中间生着五个煤火炉子，炉火烧的正旺。靠墙的桌子上放着一架五灯收音机，正放着一段轻快的音乐。地上两排十个人面对面的坐在洁白的苇席上，低着头，紧张地织着。柔软的苇篾子在她们怀里穿梭般跳动着，谁也不抬头，好紧张的场面啊！我问了问旁边那个看着表的小姑娘，才知道她们正在比赛。我不好打搅她们，就站在一旁看着。靠北墙那个织的最快的不就是姜梦兰吗。看她那两只手是多么熟练，简直就像飞一样，一忽儿就织出一大片！“姜梦兰，一点零二十五分！”听到小姑娘的喊声，才看到她微笑着抬起头来，长长地吁了一口气，站起来。
    “好快！”我不禁喊出声来。她猛地发现了我：“唉呀！是你呀！”
    比赛全部结束了，食堂里响起了钟声。她把我拉到她家去，非要叫我在她家吃饭。我说：“你们不是在食堂里吃吗？你不是早就想要有个食堂吗？”
      “是呀。今天来了客，咱打回来吃吧，给你要几个好菜，你等着吧！我叫他也回来吃。你轻易不来……”说着把我往炕上一推，蹬蹬地跑出去了。这时我坐在炕沿上，才注意看她屋里的摆设：这是三间新盖的正房，雪白的墙壁，大花顶棚；靠北墙是一个红漆大柜，柜上摆着一个双铃马蹄表，一部矿石收音机，当中有一个大镜框，里边是她们一家人的照片和一张奖状，再往上看是一幅毛主席像。屋子里拾掇得非常整洁、漂亮！真不像是个有四个孩子的人家。
    一忽儿，她们两口子都回来了，每人提着一个饭盒，刘常顺一进院就喊：“是王同志来了吗？”我赶紧迎出去，他拉住我的手说：“快呀！你怎么这几年也不来了呢？屋里坐吧！”
    “孩子们呢？”开始动筷了，我才发现就我们三个人，忙问。
    “他们都不在家里吃，上学的在学校里吃，上幼儿园的在幼儿园吃，天黑了才回来呢。”姜梦兰笑着回答。“要不是公社化，成立了食堂、托儿所，凭什么我一天能织五片席？这四个孩子我就玩不转了，还干得了活吗？”她笑得那么快乐，比我第一次见她时还显得年青。
