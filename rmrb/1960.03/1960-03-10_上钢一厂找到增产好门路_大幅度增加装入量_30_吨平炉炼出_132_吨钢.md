Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant workers recently conducted a high-yield experiment on No. 2 open hearth furnace, significantly increasing the charging volume of the open hearth furnace and significantly increasing steel production. The experiment resulted in this open hearth furnace, designed to only hold thirty tons, continuously refining five heats of steel with a furnace output of over one hundred tons; the highest heat reached one hundred and thirty-two tons, setting the city's highest output record, and every heat of steel was of first-class quality.

　　The high-yield experiment on No. 2 open hearth furnace was successfully achieved by adopting measures such as double runners, double ladles, and double ground ingot cars for tapping. This high-yield experiment powerfully broke through the conservative thinking that the potential of open hearth furnaces had already been fully tapped and found the key to liberating open hearth productivity. According to the plant's calculations, as long as some steel ladles, ground ingot cars and other equipment are added in the future, the furnace output of No. 1 and No. 2 open hearth furnaces can be increased from the current eighty tons to one hundred tons to one hundred and thirty tons, which is equivalent to adding a new open hearth furnace of the same size.

　　The miracle created by Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant on open hearth furnaces is the result of the workers' humbly learning from advanced open hearth furnace units and establishing revolutionary ambitions. The two 30-ton open hearth furnaces of Plant No. 1, during the Great Leap Forward last year and the year before, repeatedly tapped the potential of the equipment by the masses of workers, and the furnace output increased from 30 tons to 45 tons, 65 tons, and 75 tons, with the highest reaching 84 tons. At this time, some cadres in the open hearth furnace workshop gradually developed complacent and conservative ideas, believing that the furnace output had more than doubled, and it would not be easy to increase it further. The Party branch of the open hearth furnace workshop organized a ideological discussion among the cadres, examined and criticized the erroneous thinking of some cadres who lacked ambition and were not humble in learning from advanced experience, and immediately organized more than 20 representatives to study at the casting steel workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, a national advanced open hearth steelmaking unit. Because of the ideological preparation at home, every representative who went to study had sharp eyes, and not only learned many advantages of the three plants in open hearth technology and operation, but also learned the ambition and soaring revolutionary spirit of the open hearth workers of the three plants.

　　All the workers and masses in the workshop went all out to strive for the realization of this innovation and overcame many difficulties. For example, there was only one tapping runner on the No. 2 open hearth furnace, and the workers worked hard overnight to rush out a second tapping runner. The charging machine on No. 2 furnace was being rushed to make, and dozens of tons of cold material had to be added manually; the workers on No. 1 furnace were rushing to repair No. 1 furnace, and at the same time, they selected the most skilled workers to help No. 2 furnace with charging. When the first heat of 105 tons of steel was released, the narrow tapping runner caused the molten steel to overflow fiercely, causing the tapping runner to leak. At that time, some workshop cadres did not dare to continue to increase the furnace output, saying that the output of the second heat should still be maintained at 100 tons. The Party branch secretary immediately convened an emergency meeting to analyze the cause of the tapping runner leak. After discussion, the workers unanimously believed that the problem of the tapping runner leak could be solved. Therefore, the furnace workers continued to increase the charging volume of the open hearth furnace, and the repair and masonry workers also rushed to raise the tapping runner behind the furnace. As a result, the second heat refined 132 tons of high-quality steel without any accidents.

    上钢一厂找到增产好门路
    大幅度增加装入量　30吨平炉炼出132吨钢
    据新华社上海电　上海第一钢铁厂职工最近在二号平炉上进行了一次大幅度地增加平炉装入量、大幅度地提高钢产量的高产试验。试验结果，这座设计能力只能装三十吨的平炉，接连炼出了五炉炉产量高达一百吨以上的钢；其中最高的一炉达到一百三十二吨，创造了全市产量最高纪录，炉炉钢都是一级品。
    二号平炉上的高产试验，是采用双槽、双包、双地铸车出钢的措施获得成功的。这次高产试验有力地冲破了平炉潜力已经挖掘到顶的保守思想，找到了解放平炉生产力的关键。据这个厂计算，今后只要增加一部分钢包、地铸车等设备，一号和二号平炉的炉产量都可以从目前的八十吨提高到一百吨到一百三十吨的水平，等于新增了一座同样大小的平炉。
    上钢一厂在平炉上创造的这个奇迹，是职工们虚心地向平炉先进单位学习和树立了革命的雄心大志后出现的。一厂两座三十吨平炉，在去年和前年大跃进中，经过工人群众一再挖掘设备潜力，炉产量从三十吨提高到四十五吨、六十五吨、七十五吨，最高达到八十四吨。这时，在平炉车间的某些干部中，逐渐地滋长了自满保守思想，认为炉产量翻了一番多，再要上去不太容易了。平炉车间的党总支在干部中组织了一次思想务虚，检查和批判了一部分干部缺乏雄心大志、不虚心学习先进经验的错误思想，并且马上组织了二十多个代表，到全国平炉炼钢先进单位——上钢三厂铸钢车间去学习。由于在家里经过务虚，去学习的代表人人眼睛雪亮，不仅把三厂平炉技术操作上的许多优点学回来，而且把三厂平炉工人的雄心大志和冲天的革命干劲也学回来了。
    全车间职工群众都全力以赴地为实现这项革新而奋斗，克服了许多困难。如二号平炉上只有一个出钢槽，工人们连夜突击赶制出第二个出钢槽。二号炉上加料机正在赶制，数十吨冷料要靠手工加进去；一号炉上的工人一面突击检修一号炉，一面抽出最熟练的工人来帮助二号炉上料。放第一炉一百零五吨钢的时候，因为出钢槽狭窄，钢水溢出猛，使出钢槽漏了。当时，某些车间干部不敢继续提高炉产量，说第二炉产量还是保持在装一百吨好。党总支书记马上召开紧急会议，分析出钢槽漏的原因。经过讨论，工人们一致认为，出钢槽漏的问题是可以想法解决的。于是，炉前工人继续增加平炉的装入量，检修和泥工也在炉后突击加高出钢槽。结果，第二炉就炼出了一百三十二吨优质钢，没有发生任何事故。
