    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th. People's communes in Sichuan are continuing to work hard under the battle cry of "linking every link, following every step, leaving no seedling behind, and not giving up a single plant," continuing to vigorously grasp the late-stage management of spring crops to ensure large ears and full grains, vowing to win an even greater bumper harvest of spring crops.
    The more than 50 million mu of spring crops planted in Sichuan Province this year have grown uniformly and strongly due to good sowing, diligent management, and careful attention. Wheat has generally begun to head, with strong seedlings and green leaves; rapeseed, peas, and broad beans have also begun to bloom in large quantities, and in some areas with earlier seasons, pods have already formed abundantly. Taking advantage of this excellent situation, leaders at all levels have loudly put forward the battle cry of "late-stage management should be more diligent, and we will not stop until the harvest begins," constantly encouraging the masses to establish the ambition to carry out the work to the end and vow to win high yields. A new upsurge of vigorously grasping the late-stage field management of spring crops has quickly been launched throughout the province. Under the slogan of "meticulously manage to the end to seize high yields, and vow to break the 1,000-jin barrier for spring crops," Jiang'an County fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes, concentrated the use of labor, mobilized more than 50,000 people in the county, formed more than 170 large corps, and adopted the spirit of "yellow first, then green, weak first, then strong, third-class first, then first-class" to carry out a concentrated campaign. In just five days, they universally applied water and fertilizer to more than 250,000 mu of spring crops in the county. After a comprehensive campaign to upgrade spring crops, the 430,000 mu of spring crops in Xichong County generally grew well.
    All localities have paid special attention to strengthening the leadership in weak links, focusing on "large amounts of water and fertilizer," and eliminating third-class seedlings in turn. After conducting inspections and evaluations, the party committees at all levels in the Jiangjin Special Zone have dispatched a large number of capable cadres to strengthen the leadership in backward areas. Xin Fan County also adopted the method of checking block by block and identifying row by row, registering third-class seedlings block by block, handing them over to party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres for contracting, signing contracts at all levels, and setting a deadline for elimination. The third-class weak seedlings, accounting for 4% of the total spring crop area in this county, were universally top-dressed with fertilizer within ten days, with an average application of more than 3,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, reports: Wheat fields in Hebei Province, where the farming season is relatively late, are gradually thawing, and wheat is successively entering the greening stage. In order to win a high and abundant wheat harvest, people's communes in various places have started wheat greening management about 20 days earlier than in previous years. As of mid-February, more than 22% of the wheat fields in the province had been irrigated with greening water, more than 40% had been top-dressed with greening fertilizer, and more than 30% had been weeded once.
    During the greening management, all localities have focused on water and fertilizer, and vigorously attacked third-class seedlings. During a general survey of wheat fields in Zunhua, Ji County, and Baodi counties, it was found that 40,000 mu of wheat that did not grow well were mainly due to the lack of water conservancy facilities and water shortage. Based on this, more than 20,000 laborers were immediately organized to sink more than 40 machine wells and brick wells in these wheat fields, and build more than 70 trunk and branch canals. They also adopted the method of combining engineering, machinery, and technology to ensure that every well has irrigation and drainage machinery and technicians, and that all channels can irrigate and drain, so that wheat has sufficient water to drink. While irrigating wheat with greening water, various localities closely combined this with skillfully top-dressing greening fertilizer, using the furrow application method to ensure that fertilizer is not lost, coarse fertilizer is applied to black soil, chemical fertilizer is applied to watery land, and thin manure is applied to loose soil. At the same time, the method of sweeping alkali and covering sand was universally adopted to transform saline-alkali wheat fields, which brought into play the fertilizer efficiency and made wheat grow vigorously.
    Due to the early and good work in various places and the careful cultivation of wheat seedlings, more than 3 million mu of third-class wheat seedlings in the province have been upgraded, and the average number of tillering stalks per mu has increased from the original 160,000 to 800,000, becoming first-class wheat fields.
    Hebei has historically had frequent spring droughts and winds, and unstable temperatures, and frost often occurs in spring. In order to prevent wheat from being attacked by frost, many communes have erected windbreaks next to the wheat fields. In many people's communes in Chengde and Baoding areas, meteorological stations have been established in high-yield wheat areas to strengthen weather forecasting, grasp the timing, so as to detect cold air, and prepare to irrigate and smoke to increase ground temperature and avoid frost.

### 加水加肥促使三类苗升级  四川河北狠抓小麦管理

    加水加肥促使三类苗升级
    四川河北狠抓小麦管理
    本报成都7日电　四川各地人民公社在“环环扣紧，步步紧跟，一苗不漏，一株不放”的战斗口号下，再鼓干劲，继续狠抓小春后期管理，保证小春穗大、粒饱，誓夺小春作物更大丰收。
    四川省今年种植的五千多万亩小春作物，由于播种好，管得勤，管得细，因此，各项作物苗稼生长整齐、健壮。小麦已普遍开始孕穗，苗壮叶青；油菜、豌豆、胡豆也大量开始开花，部分季节较早的地区已结荚累累。各级领导乘此大好形势响亮地提出“后期管理更加勤，不到开镰不收兵”的战斗口号，不断鼓舞群众树立一抓到底，誓夺高产的雄心大志。各地迅速掀起了狠抓小春作物后期田间管理新高潮。江安县在“精管到底夺高产，誓破小春千斤关”的口号下，充分运用人民公社的优越性，集中使用劳力，全县出动五万多人，组成了一百七十多个大兵团，采取先黄后青，先弱后壮，先三类后一类的精神，开展突击，仅五天时间就给全县二十五万多亩小春作物普遍施了一次水肥。西充县经过全面开展小春升级的突击运动，全县四十三万多亩小春作物普遍生长良好。
    各地特别注意加强薄弱环节的领导，以“大水大肥”为中心，轮番消灭三类苗。江津专区各级党委通过检查评比以后，都增派了大批得力干部加强后进地区的领导。新繁县还采取块块检查，行行鉴定的办法，将三类苗逐块登记，交给党、团员和干部负责包干，层层签订合同，限期消灭。这个县占小春总面积4％的三类弱苗，十天内普遍追了肥，平均施用优质肥三千斤以上。
    据新华社天津讯　农时季节较晚的河北省麦田逐渐解冻，小麦陆续进入返青阶段。为了夺取小麦高产多收，各地人民公社比往年提早二十天左右开始小麦返青管理。截至2月中旬，全省已有22％以上的麦田浇了返青水，40％以上追了返青肥，30％以上锄了一次。
    各地在返青管理中都以水、肥为主，猛攻三类苗。遵化、蓟县、宝坻三县在麦田普查中发现长得不好的四万亩小麦，主要是没有水利设施，小麦缺水。据此马上组织了二万多名劳力在这些麦田里打机井、砖井四十多眼，修干、支渠七十多条，还采取工程、机具、技术三配套的办法，达到井井有排灌机械、有技术员，一切渠道能灌能排，使小麦有了充足的水喝。在浇小麦返青水中各地紧密结合巧追返青肥，运用开沟追肥法，作到施肥不流失，黑土地追粗肥，水地追化肥，松土地追粪稀。同时，对盐碱麦地普遍采取扫碱盖沙的方法进行改造，发挥了肥效，使小麦生长旺盛。
    由于各地抓的早、抓的好，对麦苗精心培育，全省已有三百多万亩三类麦苗升了级，平均每亩分蘖株数已由原来的十六万株增长到八十万株，跃成一类麦田。
    河北各地历来春旱多风，气温不稳，往往春季发生霜冻。为了防止小麦遭受霜冻袭击，很多公社在麦田旁边插了风障。承德、保定地区许多人民公社在小麦丰产方里，建立气象站，加强气象预报，掌握天时，以便发现冷空气，即准备灌水熏烟，施有机肥，提高地温，避免霜冻。
