Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 11th: It was announced here today that Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on March 8 to Lieutenant General Bal, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos. In his letter, Pham Van Dong requested Bal to pay attention to the current serious situation in Laos and demanded guarantees that the Lao elections be conducted in accordance with the spirit of the Vientiane Agreements.

The letter stated, "Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Lao authorities are conducting election activities that violate the Vientiane Agreements and the Geneva Accords. They are attempting to exclude the Lao Patriotic Front from the elections and obstructing the party from engaging in legitimate political activities. This behavior grossly violates the Vientiane Agreements and contravenes the Geneva Accords."

The letter stated, "U.S. imperialism is still constantly trying every possible means to undermine the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements on the Laotian question, continuing to conspire to turn Laos into a U.S. military base, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The letter concluded, "As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on the Laotian question, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot but be concerned about the current serious situation in Laos, and requests you, in your capacity as Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, to take appropriate measures to promptly stop the acts of U.S. imperialism in Laos, restore the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, and ensure that the Lao elections are conducted in accordance with the spirit of the Vientiane Agreements. Currently, the priority is to negotiate with the Lao Royal Government, instigating them to restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front who are being detained, so that they can participate in the elections."

    范文同总理致函老挝国际委员会
    要求保障老挝大选按万象协议进行
    新华社河内11日电　这里今天公布了越南民主共和国外交部长范文同8日写给老挝国际监督和监察委员会主席巴尔中将的信。范文同在信中要求巴尔注意老挝当前的严重局势并要求保障老挝大选按照万象协议的精神进行。
    信中说，“老挝当局在美帝国主义嗾使下，正在进行违反万象协议和日内瓦协议的大选活动。他们力图把老挝爱国战线党排除在大选之外，并阻挠这个党从事合法的政治活动。这种行为粗暴地侵犯了万象协议，违反了日内瓦协议。”
    信中说，“美帝国主义仍然在不断千方百计地破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和万象协议，继续阴谋把老挝变成美国的军事基地，威胁越南民主共和国的安全，威胁印度支那和东南亚的和平”。
    信中最后说，“越南民主共和国政府作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方，不能不关心老挝当前的严重局势，并请求您以老挝国际监督和监察委员会主席的地位，采取应有的措施，及时制止美帝国主义侵入老挝的行为，恢复老挝国际监督和监察委员会的活动，保障老挝大选按照万象协议的精神进行，目前首先是向老挝王国政府进行交涉，嗾使他们恢复苏发努冯亲王和正被拘禁的老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由，使他们能够参加大选。”
