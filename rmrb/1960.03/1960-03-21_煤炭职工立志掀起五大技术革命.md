    Ministry of Coal Industry and others hold a radio conference to announce the launch of a mass movement to select 100,000 pacesetters, universally raising production levels
    Bo Yibo calls for creating conditions in terms of ideology, organization, materials, and technology for the entire decade of the sixties to continuously leap forward
    Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: The large-scale high-yield red flag emulation drive centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in the national coal industry system is surging forward with tremendous momentum. Today's Coal Industry Worker Technological Revolution Swearing-in Radio Conference held in Beijing called on coal workers across the country to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the red banner of the General Line, to advance triumphantly along the path of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulic operation, and semi-hydraulic operation, and to realize the continued leap forward of the coal industry in 1960.
    Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo spoke at the meeting. He said that coal is a means of production and means of livelihood directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The coal industry occupies an extremely important position in the entire national economy. The continuous leap forward of the coal industry has a significant impact on the continuous leap forward of the national economy. Therefore, the Party and the people require all coal mine workers to better implement the Party's General Line, to comprehensively and overfulfill the 1960 national plan, and to actively create conditions in terms of ideology, organization, materials, and technology for the continuous leap forward of the entire decade of the sixties, to develop the coal industry at high speed, so as to meet the ever-growing needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. Bo Yibo said that in the great mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution currently underway, coal workers have not lagged behind in this regard. He called on all coal workers to make more contributions in this great technological reform movement. He proposed that this year's technological innovation and technological revolution in the coal industry should focus on liberating heavy physical labor, simplifying production processes, and saving pit props, vigorously promoting mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulic operation, and semi-hydraulic operation. Bo Yibo said that coal workers have already made outstanding contributions to socialist construction in the continuous great leaps forward of 1958 and 1959. He encouraged coal workers to have communist ambitions and lofty aspirations and to achieve even more brilliant achievements in the first year of the sixties.
    Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, called on female workers on the coal industry front to actively participate in the large-scale high-yield red flag emulation drive centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and to strive to improve the production technology level of the coal industry and improve coal mining methods. Cai Chang also called on coal mine workers' families to cooperate with relevant parties to vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, to develop from organizing mainly household labor to comprehensively organizing collective life, to develop public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, service groups, etc., into complete sets and networks, to continue to improve, and to further implement the socialization of household labor.
    Today's radio conference was jointly organized by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Central People's Broadcasting Station. More than 1,000 representatives from coal mines across the country participated in today's conference.
    Minister of Coal Industry Zhang Linzhi spoke at the meeting. He said that this year, the production and construction plan of the coal industry is still a leaping forward plan. In order to achieve this year's continued leap forward, our working policy is: to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the red banner of the General Line, to extensively and deeply carry out the large-scale high-yield red flag emulation drive centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, to improve the political ideology and cultural level of the workers, to improve the level of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulic operation, and semi-hydraulic operation, to improve the level of enterprise management, to improve labor productivity, to comprehensively and overfulfill the national plan, and to further change the technological face of the coal industry.
    Zhang Linzhi said, therefore, we must give full play to soaring revolutionary energy and dauntless creative spirit, and carry out "five major revolutions," which are the great revolution of mining methods, the great revolution of liberating heavy physical labor, the great revolution of accelerating the progress of mining, tunneling, and drilling, the great revolution of simplifying production processes, and the great revolution of using less or no pit props. He said that in the process of making great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution, we must vigorously promote the 180 major advanced experiences and advanced technologies that proved effective in 1959, so that they can blossom and bear fruit in coal mines across the country; we must organize forces to overcome 18 high-level, precise, and cutting-edge technologies this year, and closely integrate general technologies with cutting-edge technologies; we must launch a mass movement of thousands of people participating in selecting 100,000 pacesetters in coal mines across the country, and transform the production level of a few advanced individuals into the production level of the broad masses.
    Zhang Linzhi mentioned in his speech that at the beginning of this year, coal production workers across the country launched the first shot of the leap forward and achieved the victory of "a good start and a complete victory." The production levels in January and February not only exceeded the production levels in the fourth quarter of last year, but also reached the planned level of the average monthly output for the whole year, creating a good start for completing and overfulfilling the annual coal production task.
    At today's radio conference, the results of the 1959 national coal industry large-scale high-yield red flag competition were announced. More than 1,600 units gloriously won the winning red flag and certificate, and they are the pioneers and flag bearers of the great leap forward of the coal industry in 1959. Now, their advanced experience is being widely promoted in coal mining enterprises across the country.
    Representatives from seven provinces, thirteen mining bureaus, thirteen coal mines, small coal kilns, eleven coal mine construction enterprises, thirteen coal mine exploration teams, and national coal mine design units and scientific research units spoke successively at the meeting, reporting on the situation of their technological innovation and technological revolution movements this year, as well as their ambitions and specific measures to achieve large-scale high yields.
    Chao Fuxiang, Director of the Liaoning Provincial Coal Administration, who won the large-scale high-yield red flag, said that Liaoning Province coal mine workers are preparing to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization of all heavy labor and manual operations before "July 1" this year; strive to complete the national plan one month ahead of schedule, and increase raw coal production by more than 26% compared with 1959. Xu Lin, representative of thirteen mining bureaus including Kailuan, Fuxin, Jixi, and Huainan, which have basically realized mining mechanization and semi-mechanization, said that the workers of these coal mines guarantee to increase the mechanization level of all production processes in these coal mines to 70% to 80% before "July 1"; complete the annual coal production plan 30 days ahead of schedule; reduce pit prop consumption by 25% to 60% compared with 1959; and reduce raw coal costs by 10% to 35% compared with 1959. Chen Zhengxing, Director of Tongxing Coal Mine in Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, spoke on behalf of more than 7,000 small coal kiln workers in Sichuan Province, and determined to adopt the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods this year to rapidly develop coal mine "small indigenous groups" enterprises into "small foreign groups" enterprises, to increase the production of more and better coal for the country. Yu Anjiang, captain of the "pioneer" of the coal industry - the 119 Geological Exploration Team, representing thirteen geological teams, said that they would do a good job as the pioneers of the coal industry and sound the drum for the continued leap forward of the coal industry in 1960.
    Today's radio conference was filled with a warm atmosphere from beginning to end. The representatives' bold statements on the central venue and the production good news uploaded from the production sites by coal mine workers across the country converged into a magnificent march to seize large-scale high yields of coal.
