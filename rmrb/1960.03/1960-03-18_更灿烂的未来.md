	A More Brilliant Future
	Lífū
	The spring is bright and the flowers are blooming. The broad masses of staff and workers in the "small-scale foreign groups" iron smelting enterprises in Hebei Province have launched a red flag emulation drive in this great spring season, determined to bring the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces to above two, the efficiency of all personnel to above five tons, the qualified rate of pig iron to above 90%, and the coke ratio to below 0.9. This new emulation target has made the red flag emulation of comprehensive technical transformation of small blast furnaces in the province even more magnificent and beautiful than in the past.
	The transition from small native furnaces and "small native groups" to small blast furnaces and "small-scale foreign groups" is a qualitative leap. However, the establishment of small blast furnaces and "small-scale foreign groups" is not the end of the transition, but the beginning of a new stage. We are adherents of the theory of continuous revolution. The socialist revolution must be carried through to the end, and labor productivity must be continuously improved. This is both our guiding ideology and our task, and it runs like a red thread through all aspects and tasks. We also view small blast furnaces and "small-scale foreign groups" with this attitude of continuous revolution. On the one hand, we firmly believe that the existing small blast furnaces can be both fast and efficient, and economical; on the other hand, we are never satisfied with the current level. In January this year, the national average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces was one. This time, the target of the Hebei Province red flag emulation is to reach an average of two or more, with some individual ones already reaching three or more. If the utilization coefficient of all small blast furnaces can reach the level of three or more, how much will the output of pig iron increase! At present, there is still an imbalance in the level of mechanization of small blast furnaces themselves. Generally speaking, the iron smelting part of small blast furnaces has now reached semi-mechanization. However, the degree of mechanization of mining, coal washing, coke production, transportation, etc., before, after, and around it is still very low. The comprehensive transition of "small-scale foreign groups" iron smelting enterprises from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization is another leap, and the current task is to accelerate the realization of this leap.
	Of course, the comprehensive technical transformation of small blast furnaces is not only for producing more iron today, but also for producing steel tomorrow. When small blast furnaces grow up, their sister, the small converter, must also grow up. The cause of socialist construction needs iron and, even more, steel. While vigorously promoting pig iron production, the current iron smelting enterprises, as long as conditions permit, should also actively prepare and steadily move towards integrated iron and steel enterprises.
	Our country has a vast territory. In this vast land, we not only need numerous small integrated iron and steel enterprises, but also numerous small fertilizer plants, small coal mines, small cement plants, small oil fields, small wild fiber processing plants... The Party's policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" is also a policy of developing small and medium-sized enterprises at high speed and in proportion. Now, some small blast furnaces are moving towards the grand goal of integrated iron and steel enterprises along the road of comprehensive transformation, presenting a more brilliant future to the people of the whole country.

    更灿烂的未来
    黎夫
    春光明媚，繁花似锦。河北省“小洋群”炼铁企业的广大职工在这大好春光里，掀起了红旗竞赛，决心把小高炉的平均利用系数达到二以上，全员效率达到五吨以上，生铁合格率达到90％以上，焦比降到零点九以下。这个新的竞赛指标，使得全省小高炉在全面技术改造的红旗竞赛中，比过去更壮大、更美丽了。
    由小土炉、“小土群”过渡到小高炉、“小洋群”，这是一个质的飞跃。但是建立了小高炉、“小洋群”，并不是过渡的完结，而是新的阶段的开始。我们是不断革命论者，社会主义革命要进行到底，劳动生产率要不断提高，这既是我们的指导思想，又是我们的任务，它像一根红线似地贯串在各个方面和各项工作中。对于小高炉、“小洋群”，我们也是用这种不断革命的态度来看待它。一方面，我们坚定地相信现有的小高炉既可以作到多快，又能够作到好省；另一方面，我们决不满足于现有水平。今年1月份全国小高炉平均利用系数是一，这次河北省红旗竞赛的指标是平均达到二以上，个别的现在已经达到三以上。如果所有小高炉的利用系数都能达到三以上的水平，那末生铁的产量该是增加多少啊！现在小高炉本身的机械化水平还存在不平衡现象。一般说来，小高炉炼铁部分现在已经达到半机械化了。但它的前后左右采矿、洗煤、炼焦、运输等机械化的程度还很低。“小洋群”炼铁企业全面地由手工操作到半机械化、机械化的过渡，这又是一个飞跃，当前的任务就是要加速实现这种飞跃。
    对小高炉进行全面的技术改造，当然不单单是为了今天多出铁，也是为了明天能出钢。小高炉成长了，它的姊妹——小转炉也要成长起来，社会主义建设事业，需要铁，更需要钢。现在的炼铁企业，在大力搞好生铁生产的同时，只要是有条件的话，也应该积极准备，坚定地逐步地向钢铁联合企业迈进。
    我们的国家幅员辽阔，在这个辽阔的土地上，我们不仅需要众多的小型钢铁联合企业，而且需要众多的小化肥厂、小煤矿、小水泥厂、小石油厂、小野生纤维加工厂……。党的“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，也是高速度和按比例地发展中小型企业的方针。现在有些小高炉正在沿着全面改造的道路向着钢铁联合企业的宏伟目标迈进，它在全国人民面前展现了更为灿烂的未来。
