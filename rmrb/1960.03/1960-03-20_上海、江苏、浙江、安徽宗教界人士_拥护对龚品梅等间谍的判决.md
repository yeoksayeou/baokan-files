Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 19th: Religious figures in Shanghai, along with representatives from Catholic dioceses and the Patriotic Catholic Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui who came to Shanghai to attend the public trial of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique and American spy Hua Lizhu [Fr. Alouisius Ford], held separate symposiums in Shanghai on the 18th, wholeheartedly supporting the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's verdicts against this counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique and the American spy. They unanimously agreed that these two verdicts were a great source of satisfaction and another serious blow to the American imperialists' conspiracy to subvert our people's democratic government.

At the symposium held by Catholic believers, Wu Wenyao, director of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Patriotic Catholic Association, said: "Over the past few years, we have adhered to the anti-imperialist patriotic movement and fought against the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique. Through this public trial, we have further realized the necessity of this struggle and its great significance in defending the socialist construction of our motherland."

Zhang Shirang, the over-eighty-year-old Acting Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, stated at the symposium: "The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique, under the joint planning of American imperialism and the Vatican, and under the personal command of American spy Hua Lizhu, conspired to overthrow our people's democratic government. This is an outrageous crime that the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The verdicts are completely correct."

Zhang Jiashu, a priest at the Xujiahui Cathedral in Shanghai, said: "We must heighten our vigilance, continue to carry out the anti-imperialist patriotic movement under the leadership of the Party, give play to our initiative, and contribute to socialist construction."

Li Weiguang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and Bishop of the Nanjing Diocese, and Wang Hao, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Patriotic Catholic Association, both solemnly pointed out at the symposium: "The trial of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique and American spy Hua Lizhu proves once again that American imperialism is our most ferocious enemy and the Vatican is an instrument of aggression for American imperialism. We must draw a clear line with the Vatican, strengthen self-reform, and adhere to the path of independence, self-reliance, and self-administration of the Church."

Tang Lüdao, Deputy Director of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Patriotic Catholic Association, emphasized in his speech that we must also strive to eliminate the influence of the ideological poison of the Vatican and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique, which we have suffered for a long time in the past, and hold high the red flag of the General Line and the anti-imperialist patriotic banner until this struggle achieves complete victory.

Bishops from Catholic dioceses in Bengbu, Anhui, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and priests, young believers, and nuns from Shanghai also angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique and American spy Hua Lizhu at the meeting.

Religious figures from Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism, and Islam in Shanghai also held a symposium on the 18th, unanimously supporting the people's court's verdicts. Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church, angrily said at the meeting: "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government have consistently implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief, and all legitimate religious beliefs and activities are protected. We in the religious community have also received the meticulous care and attention of the Party and the government, but we must never allow imperialists and counter-revolutionaries to use religion to carry out reactionary activities." He expressed his full support for the people's court's verdicts against the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and traitorous clique and American spy Hua Lizhu. They expressed their determination to strengthen their studies, strive for self-reform, always listen to the Communist Party, and follow the socialist road.

    上海、江苏、浙江、安徽宗教界人士
    拥护对龚品梅等间谍的判决
    据新华社上海19日电　上海宗教界人士和前来上海参加公审龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱案件的江苏、浙江、安徽等地天主教区及天主教友爱国会代表，18日分别在上海集会座谈，衷心拥护上海市中级人民法院对这个反革命叛国集团和美国间谍的判决。他们一致认为这两个判决是一件大快人心的事，是给美帝国主义颠复我国人民民主政权的阴谋又一次严重的打击。
    在天主教教友举行的座谈会上，上海市天主教友爱国会筹委会主任吴文耀说：几年来，我们坚持了反帝爱国运动，对龚品梅反革命叛国集团进行斗争，现在通过这次公开审判，我们更加看清了这个斗争的必要性和对保卫祖国社会主义建设的重大意义。
    八十多岁的天主教上海教区代主教张士琅在座谈会上发言说：“龚品梅反革命叛国集团在美帝国主义和罗马教廷的共同策划，并且在美国间谍华理柱亲自指挥下，阴谋推翻我国人民民主政权，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的滔天罪行，现在这样判决是完全正确的。”
    上海市徐家汇天主堂神甫张家树说：我们一定要提高警惕，在党的领导下，继续开展反帝爱国运动，发挥我们的积极性，为建设社会主义贡献力量。
    中国天主教友爱国会副主席、南京教区主教李维光和江苏省天主教友爱国会副主任汪皓都在座谈会上严正指出：对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的审判再一次证明，美帝国主义是我们最凶恶的敌人，罗马教廷是美帝国主义的侵略工具。我们必须与罗马教廷划清界线，加强自我改造，坚持走独立自主、自办教会的道路。
    上海市天主教友爱国会筹委会副主任汤履道在发言中，特别强调指出，我们还必须努力清除过去长时期所受的罗马教廷和龚品梅反革命叛国集团思想毒素的影响，高举总路线红旗和反帝爱国旗帜，直到这一斗争取得完全胜利为止。
    安徽蚌埠、江苏徐州、浙江温州等地天主教区主教及上海的神父、青年教友和修女等也都在会上愤怒指斥龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的滔天罪行。
    上海的基督教、佛教、道教、伊斯兰教等宗教界人士在18日也举行座谈会，一致拥护人民法院的判决。中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗在会上愤怒地说：中华人民共和国开国以来，党和政府一贯实行宗教信仰自由政策，凡是正当的宗教信仰和宗教活动都受到保护。我们宗教界也受到了党和政府无微不至的关怀和照顾，但是我们绝不能允许帝国主义和反革命分子利用宗教来进行反动活动。他表示完全拥护人民法院对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的判决。他们表示一定要加强学习，努力自我改造，永远听共产党的话，走社会主义道路。
