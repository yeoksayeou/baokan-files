Growing Vegetables, Raising Pigs, Operating Sidelines, Improving Commune Members' Lives
Ruyang County's Public Canteens Build Up a Foundation

(Our report) Public canteens in Ruyang County, Henan Province, are vigorously engaging in household production, which has played a very good role in consolidating and running the public canteens well and improving the lives of commune members. Each canteen, based on its own conditions, is engaged in vegetable production, raising chickens, ducks, rabbits, and fish, and establishing flour mills, tofu workshops, and other sideline production. According to current statistics, the county's 1,790 canteens have raised more than 63,000 pigs, averaging one pig for every three people or so, and established more than 18,800 mu of vegetable bases. In addition to improving the lives of commune members, some non-staple foods are also sold, generating an income of more than 1.66 million yuan last year alone. This money is generally used for the basic construction of the canteens. The Huangzhuang Canteen of the Beibao Brigade of the Santun Commune used the income from pig raising and vegetable growing to build five new simple dining rooms last year, which made the commune members love the public canteen even more.

In vigorously developing canteen household production, Ruyang County pays special attention to helping some canteens solve specific problems. When household production was first started, many canteens lacked funds, but the problem was quickly solved by adopting the method of "relying on the masses, self-reliance, commune members' investment, reasonable remuneration, and regular repayment." In order to both do a good job in canteen work and household production, all canteens in the county are vigorously grasping the reform of cooking utensils. According to incomplete statistics, 14,160 cooks have been saved as a result, which makes it possible to draw 6,793 people to engage in canteen household production. Some canteen cooks also reasonably arrange their time, turning one person into two (cook and household production worker), cooking and producing at the same time.

In order to further develop public canteen household production, Ruyang County also regularly conducts major inspections and appraisals to promote this work to be done better.

### 种菜养猪　经营副业　搞好社员生活  汝阳县公共食堂建立家底

    种菜养猪　经营副业　搞好社员生活
    汝阳县公共食堂建立家底
    本报讯　河南省汝阳县公共食堂大搞家底生产，对巩固和办好公共食堂，改善社员生活，起了很好的作用。各食堂根据自己的条件，分别进行蔬菜生产，饲养鸡、鸭、兔、鱼，建立粉房、豆腐房等各种副业生产。截至目前统计，全县一千七百九十个食堂，共养猪六万三千多头，平均三个多人有一头，建立蔬菜基地一万八千八百多亩，除改善社员生活外，还有部分副食品出售，去年一年就收入一百六十六万多元。这些钱一般都用于食堂的基本建设。三屯公社北保大队黄庄食堂，去年用养猪种菜收入，新盖简易饭厅五间，社员因此更加热爱公共食堂。
    汝阳县在大搞食堂家底生产中，特别注意帮助一些食堂解决具体问题。开始搞家底生产，有很多食堂资金不足，但是采用“依靠群众，自力更生，社员投资，合理报酬，定期偿还”的办法很快就得到解决。为了既搞好食堂工作，又搞好家底生产，全县各个食堂都大抓炊具改革，据不完全统计，全县因此节省炊事人员一万四千一百六十名，这就有可能抽出六千七百九十三人搞食堂家底生产。也有的食堂炊事员合理安排时间，一员变成两员（炊事员、家底生产员），一手做饭，一手生产。
    为了公共食堂家底生产进一步发展，汝阳县还定期开展大检查、大评比，以促进这项工作搞得更好。
