Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th. The "Pravda" published an editorial today stating that each new day of Khrushchev's visit to France clearly demonstrates how widely recognized and highly regarded the Soviet Union's lofty efforts in consolidating peace have become. The powerful Soviet socialist state appears before all of humanity as the standard-bearer in the struggle for peace and friendship among all peoples.

The editorial said that the warm welcome given to Khrushchev in France proves that the French people's hearts are filled with feelings of traditional friendship towards Russia and the Soviet Union. The glorious combat friendship forged by the people of the two great nations in the years of the fierce struggle against German militarism has not been erased from their memories and will not be erased. The Soviet people also have good feelings towards the French comrades who fought side by side and towards the hardworking and intelligent French people. We have personally experienced that the Franco-Soviet alliance has steadfastly promoted the strengthening of the security of both countries and is beneficial to the national interests of the Soviet Union and France.

The editorial pointed out that life unswervingly demands close cooperation between the Soviet Union and France. The development of the situation in Europe shows that whenever such cooperation is lacking, all sorts of warmongering adventurers have the opportunity to carry out incitement. It is no accident that now the broad public in France and other European countries are worried about the dangerous conspiracies of those West German militarists who are trying to launch new offensives along the old road of war.

The editorial said: In order to ensure that militarism and aggression no longer threaten European peace, it is necessary to end the remnants of World War II and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. It would benefit all participating countries of the former anti-Hitler alliance to treat things in this way, and the German people and the cause of peace would certainly benefit.

The editorial finally said that the broad masses of the French people and many political activists throughout the country are talking about: Now there is indeed the possibility for our two countries to unite and consolidate the cause of peace! Of course, it is difficult to eliminate all the accumulated dirt formed by years of "Cold War" all at once. But as long as we make joint efforts in mutual understanding and cooperation, we can remove all the barriers to closer relations between the two largest countries in Europe.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论指出
    法国人民热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫
    新华社莫斯科28日电　“真理报”今天发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫在法国访问的每一天新日程昭然若揭地表明，苏联在巩固和平方面的崇高努力在这里取得了多么广泛的承认和多么高的信誉。强大的苏维埃社会主义国家以争取和平和各国人民之间友谊的旗手出现在全人类的面前。
    社论说，在法国，热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫的事实证明，在法国人民的内心里充满着对俄国、对苏联传统友谊的情感。在他们的记忆中不曾磨灭掉也将不会磨灭掉关于两个伟大国家人民在反抗德国军国主义而进行残酷斗争的年代里所结成的光荣的战斗友谊的回忆。苏联人民对于并肩作战的法国同志、对于勤劳智慧的法国人民同样怀着良好的感情。我们亲身体会到，法苏联盟曾坚定不移地促进了两国安全的加强，有利于苏联和法国的民族利益。
    社论指出，生活坚定不渝地要求苏联和法国之间密切合作。欧洲事态的发展表明，什么时候没有这种合作，那时形形色色的好战冒险家就有机可乘进行煽动活动。现在，法国和欧洲其它国家的广大公众对那些妄想沿着战争老路作新进攻的西德军国主义者的危险阴谋感到耽心，这不是偶然的。
    社论说：为了使军国主义和侵略不再威胁欧洲和平，必须结束第二次世界大战的残余，缔结对德和约。以前反希特勒联盟的所有参加国用这种态度对待事情就会得到好处，德国人民以及和平事业当然也会得到好处。
    社论最后说，法国广大的群众和全国许多政治活动家都在谈论：现在我们两国之间的确存在着可能联合起来巩固和平事业！当然，很难一下子消除由于多年“冷战”所形成的所有积垢。但是只要在互相谅解和合作方面共同努力，就能够消除欧洲两个最大国家接近的所有壁障。
