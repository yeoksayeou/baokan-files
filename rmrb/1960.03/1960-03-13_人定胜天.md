The Victory of North Vietnam's Struggle Against Natural Disasters Last Year

Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, the people of North Vietnam achieved great victories in water conservancy construction and the fight against drought and floods last year, ensuring a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

In 1959, North Vietnam suffered from a series of natural disasters, including drought, floods, and waterlogging. The severe drought in the winter and spring of 1958-1959 lasted for three to four months. When autumn sowing began in 1959, the drought recurred, and after the autumn sowing, floods struck again. When the rice was heading, it was threatened by drought again.

However, the Vietnamese farmers were not intimidated by the disasters. Under the strong leadership of the Party, they bravely fought against natural disasters. Leading cadres at all levels personally participated in the disaster relief struggle. The rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement played a huge role in overcoming natural disasters.

In the fight against natural disasters, the broad masses displayed a spirit of heroism, tenacity, unity, and mutual assistance. Many villages concentrated thousands of people together to fight the drought. Some families, regardless of men, women, old, and young, worked hard for three days and three nights to save the rice.

North Vietnam achieved great success in the farmland water conservancy movement last year. A total of 15 million cubic meters of earthwork embankments and 140,000 cubic meters of stone revetment projects were built within a year. Some water conservancy projects capable of irrigating 120,000 hectares of paddy fields and many medium and small-sized water conservancy projects were completed. The irrigated area expanded by 16.5% within a year.

Due to the victory of the struggle against natural disasters, North Vietnam's agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest in 1959. The total agricultural output value increased by 8.2% compared to 1958, and the rice output increased by 13.4%. The unit area yield of early and late rice created unprecedented records.

    越南北方去年抗灾斗争的胜利
    越南北方人民在劳动党的领导下，去年在兴修水利和抗旱、抗洪斗争中获得了巨大的胜利，保证了农业生产的丰收。
    1959年，越南北方接连发生了旱、洪、涝等自然灾害。1958—1959年冬春季的严重旱灾延续三、四个月。1959年秋播时，旱灾又重演，秋播过后又遭到洪水。当稻子出穗时，又遭受旱灾的威胁。
    但是，越南农民并没有被灾害吓倒，他们在党的坚强领导下，英勇地同自然灾害展开了搏斗。各级领导干部亲自参加了抗灾斗争。农业合作化运动的迅速发展，在战胜天灾方面发挥了巨大的作用。
    在抗灾斗争中，广大群众发挥了英勇顽强和团结互助的精神。有不少乡村集中好几千人在一起共同抗旱。有些家庭不分男女老少，一连苦战三天三夜抢救稻子。
    越南北方去年农田水利运动获得很大成绩。一年内共修筑一千五百万土方堤坝，十四万石方护堤工程，建成了一些可灌溉十二万公顷稻田的水利工程以及许多中、小型水利工程。一年内灌溉面积扩大了16．5％。
    由于抗灾斗争的胜利，1959年越南北方农业生产获得大丰收，农业总产值比1958年增长8．2％，而稻谷产量增长了13．4％。早、晚稻的单位面积产量创造空前纪录。
