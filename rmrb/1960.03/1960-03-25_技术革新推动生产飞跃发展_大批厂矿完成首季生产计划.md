Technological Innovation Promotes Production Leaps
A Large Number of Factories and Mines Complete First Quarter Production Plans

The Fuxin Mining Bureau has completed its first quarter raw coal production plan eleven and a half days ahead of schedule. The average daily output increased by 20% compared to last year; the total labor productivity, raw coal quality, profits turned over to the state, and cost reduction, among other indicators, also exceeded the plan. Total labor efficiency increased by 37.4% compared to last year.

Since the beginning of this year, the coal mines under the Fuxin Mining Bureau have launched a wave of technological innovation, starting with the mechanization of coal hewing, which has promoted continuous production increases. From the beginning of the year to mid-March, a total of 6,626 technological innovations have been implemented, and 701 local and foreign experiences have been promoted. Two hundred and twenty types of experience have been incorporated into regulations. Among the technological innovation projects that have been implemented, 2,526 have increased efficiency by one to ten times or more.

The Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant completed its first quarter production plan thirteen days ahead of schedule. As of March 18, tractor production exceeded the quarterly plan by 1.8%, irrigation and drainage engine production exceeded the quarterly plan by 60.9%, and the total output value and commodity output value have reached 100.1% and 101% of the quarterly plan, respectively.

The first quarter production task of the First Tractor Plant was very heavy, but it was completed well. The main reason is that the plant leaders did a good job of grasping both the current situation and preparing for the future.

Workers at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant completed the first quarter production plan ten days ahead of schedule. As of March 21, the total output value of the plant had completed 100.24% of the quarterly plan, the commodity output value completed 102.67%, the product output completed 101.7%, the labor productivity increased by 10.7% compared to the highest month of December last year, the comparable product cost decreased by more than 10% compared to last year, and the product quality also improved significantly. Safe production was also achieved.

In the process of completing the plan, the plant adhered to the policy of putting politics in command and launching a mass movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. At the beginning of this year, the plant's workers began to march toward mechanization and automation; by mid-March, 114 pieces of equipment had achieved semi-automation and automation.

Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant has completed the first quarter production task ahead of schedule. As of March 19, the total output value completed by this factory has exceeded the quarterly plan by 5%; labor productivity completed the plan by 100.5%, and costs were reduced by 5.9% compared to the plan.

In the first quarter of this year, this factory completed two automated workshops, seven automatic production lines, and twenty-two single-machine automatic machine tools in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement; in addition, 2,644 innovative suggestions were implemented, increasing work efficiency by one to 610 times, saving a large number of labor and funds, thereby completing the first quarter production task in a faster, better, and more economical manner.

Nanjing Chemical Industry Company has entered the second quarter ahead of schedule. The first quarter industrial output value plan was overfulfilled on March 12; the output of nine major chemical products all exceeded the first quarter targets; the cost of comparable products was also lower than planned.

Due to the widespread and in-depth development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the company's production level in the first quarter of this year was greatly improved compared to the fourth quarter of last year, without increasing major production equipment. Chemical fertilizer increased by 90%, sulfuric acid increased by 7%, and synthetic ammonia increased by 9%.

Kunming Machine Tool Plant has comprehensively overfulfilled the first quarter production plan eleven days ahead of schedule. As of March 20, the total output value completed 102.13% of the quarterly plan, the machine tool output completed 100.4%, the profits turned over to the state completed 100.15%, the labor productivity completed 103.14%, and the comparable product cost was reduced by 0.57% compared to the plan.

Under the leadership of the Party Committee, this factory formulated technological transformation plans level by level from top to bottom at the beginning of this year, and a lively situation of "everyone making innovations, everyone starting work, every item having competitions, and every class beating drums" quickly appeared throughout the factory. From January to March 17, the factory implemented more than 8,100 technological innovation suggestions, increasing efficiency by one to 300 times.

Chongqing Radio Factory comprehensively overfulfilled the first quarter production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule. As of the 16th, the total output value of the factory completed 100.16% of the quarterly plan, an increase of 27.27% compared to the fourth quarter of last year; the varieties and output of major products also completed the plan; labor productivity completed 102.5%; product qualification rate completed 103.1%; and product cost was reduced by 41.13% compared to the plan. The factory also produced nine new products.

In the great battle of the first quarter, the factory's workers vigorously carried out the "12345" movement (that is, to realize the mechanization of one thousand manual operations, two mechanized and automated workshops, thirty automatic and assembly lines, four hundred single-machine automations, and save five thousand laborers). In just twenty-nine days, the factory summarized more than 1,100 major innovative experiences and promoted 950 of them, which multiplied production efficiency.

The workers of Hangzhou Universal Machinery Manufacturing Plant vigorously engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution, which powerfully promoted current production. So far, the first quarter production plan of this factory has been overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

At present, the degree of mechanization of this factory has increased from 35% at the end of last year to 82%. Due to the rapid increase in the degree of mechanization, the production capacity of the entire factory has doubled compared to before the innovation.

In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, Zhejiang Xiaoshan Motor Factory seized the opportunity to solve the new problems that appeared after the innovation, so that the innovation was closely integrated with production, and the first quarter plan was comprehensively overfulfilled ahead of schedule on March 14.

In late February, after the entire factory's employees used one day and two nights to realize the semi-automation of all machine tools, they vigorously grasped the use of new tools and new machines, and vigorously grasped the mechanization and semi-mechanization of casting and forging. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the casting workshop rapidly increased from the original 65% to about 80%. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
