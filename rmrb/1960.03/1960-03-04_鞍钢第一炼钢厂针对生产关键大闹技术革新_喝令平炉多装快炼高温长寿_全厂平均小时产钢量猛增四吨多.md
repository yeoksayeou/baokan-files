Anshan, March 3rd (Reported by this newspaper) – The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steel Plant, a vanguard on Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking front, is boldly reforming steelmaking operation techniques, demanding open hearth furnaces to "load more, refine faster, maintain high temperatures, and have long lifespans," making an all-round leap forward and pushing the steelmaking production technology to a new peak since the plant's opening. In the past ten days, the average hourly steel production of the entire plant has surged by 4.8 tons compared to January and more than 4 tons compared to the first nineteen days of February, setting a new record since the plant's opening. This has not only overfulfilled the February production plan but also prepared ample conditions for continued leaps forward in March.

The average hourly steel production is a concentrated reflection of the level of steelmaking production technology. The amount of average hourly steel production depends on the amount of new material charged per furnace, the length of smelting time, and the level of effective operation rate. In the past, due to inadequate furnace maintenance, the shape of the furnace cavity could not be maintained normally, affecting the further increase of the charged amount. Due to defects in the charging method, every time the charging amount was increased, the melting time would be prolonged, becoming two major keys to the continued leap forward in steelmaking production. After the plant's Party committee led the entire plant to overfulfill the January production plan by more than 6,000 tons, it conducted detailed investigations and research, and found that the main reasons for the inability to further increase the charging amount and the long melting time were problems in steelmaking operation technology. It promptly guided the enthusiasm and wisdom of the entire plant's workers to reform steelmaking operation technology. In the first twenty-odd days of February, the plant's workers put forward more than 6,700 innovation proposals focusing on key production areas, about twice as many as in January, promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and closely combining it with the promotion of production leaps forward.

The steel-grabbing warriors fighting on the open hearth furnaces formed a dozen or so "three-way combination" performance groups, simultaneously experimenting with and improving steelmaking operation techniques, and demonstrating and promoting successful experiences in an organized and planned manner, launching a comprehensive offensive against the two major keys of more loading and faster refining. Workers of the No. 4 open hearth furnace began experimenting in January and successfully developed a set of "three diligences, one accuracy, and three ruthlessness" experiences in maintaining the furnace body, maintaining the furnace body very well and creating an advanced achievement of "the furnace head does not block the fire, and the water jacket does not grow taller" when refining a hundred furnaces of steel. This time, they formed a furnace body maintenance performance group, transmitting and promoting their experience through performances, creating conditions for maintaining the open hearth furnace body and expanding the open hearth furnace loading amount. Han Weiyu, the furnace chief of the No. 1 open hearth furnace, while learning from the advanced experience of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, created the experience of repairing the back wall of the furnace, making the charging amount per furnace expand by 16.6%, setting off a competition in maintaining the furnace body and expanding the charging amount in the entire open hearth furnace and between open hearth furnaces. In the last ten days of February, the average output of each furnace of steel reached 280 tons for open hearth furnaces originally designed for 150 tons; and the output of each furnace of steel had stabilized at around 350 tons for open hearth furnaces originally designed for 180 tons, respectively increasing by more than 3% and 2% compared to January. The charging method performance group, composed of the Class B foreman, the No. 1 open hearth furnace chief, and the No. 6 open hearth furnace chief, shortened the melting time by about one hour when demonstrating a new charging method they had successfully researched. This successful performance attracted steelworkers to participate in the experimental research of improving the charging method. Within a few days, thirteen new charging methods appeared. These thirteen charging methods each had their own strengths. The plant's Party committee further organized furnace chiefs, relevant cadres, and technicians, and after analysis and research, they took the strengths of each and made up for the weaknesses, and finally summarized them into three complete charging methods, which were quickly promoted in all open hearth furnaces. Since late February, although the charging amount of the open hearth furnaces has been greatly expanded, the melting time has not only not been extended, but has been shortened from 5.22 minutes in January to 5.04 minutes in late February, enabling the open hearth furnaces to achieve an all-round great leap forward in high temperature, long life, more loading, and faster refining. While steelworkers were improving operation techniques, other work sections and types of work also achieved many major technical innovations, ensuring the steady rise of steelmaking production.

    鞍钢第一炼钢厂针对生产关键大闹技术革新
    喝令平炉多装快炼高温长寿
    全厂平均小时产钢量猛增四吨多
    本报鞍山3日电　鞍钢炼钢战线上的急先锋——鞍钢第一炼钢厂广大职工，大胆地改革炼钢操作技术，喝令平炉“多装，快炼，高温，长寿”，全面跃进，把炼钢生产技术水平推上开工以来的新高峰。最近十天来，全厂平均每小时的产钢量，比1月份猛增四点八吨，比2月头十九天增加四吨多，创造开工以来的最高新纪录，不仅超额完成了2月份的生产计划，而且为3月份的继续跃进准备了充分的条件。
    平均每小时产钢多少，是炼钢生产技术水平高低的集中表现。平均小时产钢量的多少，决定于每炉钢新入量多少，冶炼时间长短和有效作业率高低。过去，这个工厂由于炉体维护得不够好，炉腔的形状不能保持正常，影响装入量不能进一步增加；由于加料方法还有缺陷，每逢扩大装入量时，就会延长熔化时间，成为炼钢生产继续跃进的两大关键。这个工厂的党委，在全厂超额六千多吨完成1月份生产计划以后，经过细致的调查研究，找出装入量不能进一步增加和熔化时间长的主要原因，是炼钢操作技术上有问题，便及时把全厂职工的干劲和智慧引导到革新炼钢操作技术上来。2月的头二十多天，全厂职工围绕着生产关键，提出六千七百多件革新建议，等于1月份的两倍左右，推动技术革新和技术革命运动和促进生产跃进紧紧地结合起来。
    战斗在平炉上的夺钢战士，组成十几个“三结合”表演团，一面试验改进炼钢操作技术，一面表演推广成功的经验，有组织有计划地向多装、快炼两大关键展开全面进攻。四号平炉的工人们从1月间就开始试验，研究成功一套“三勤、一准和三狠”的维护炉体经验，把炉体一直维护得很好，创造出炼一百炉钢“炉头不挡火，水套不长高”的先进事迹。这次，他们又组成维护炉体表演团，通过表演传授和推广他们的经验，为维护好平炉炉体，扩大平炉装入量创造了条件。一号平炉炉长韩维玉，在学习上钢三厂先进经验的同时，创造出补好炉子后墙的经验，使每炉钢装入量扩大了16．6％，在全平炉和平炉之间，掀起了一场维护好炉体，扩大装入量的竞赛。在2月份最后十天里，原设计为一百五十吨的平炉，平均每炉钢的产量达到二百八十吨；原设计为一百八十吨的平炉，每炉钢的产量已经稳定在三百五十吨左右，分别比1月份提高3％和2％以上。由乙班工长、一号平炉炉长、六号平炉炉长等人组成的加料方法表演团，在表演他们研究成功的一种新加料方法时，使熔化时间缩短一小时左右。这一成功的表演，吸引着炼钢工人们纷纷参加到改进加料方法的试验研究里来，在短短几天之内就出现了十三种新的加料方法。这十三种加料方法各有所长。这个工厂的党委便进一步组织炉长、有关干部和技术人员，经过分析研究取长补短，最后归纳成三种完整的加料方法，很快就在所有平炉上推广开来。2月下旬以来，虽然平炉的装入量扩大了许多，可是熔化时间不但没有延长，反而由1月份的五点二十二分钟，缩短到2月下旬的五点零十四分钟，使平炉实现了高温、长寿、多装、快炼的全面大跃进。在炼钢工人们改进操作技术的同时，其他各个工段和工种，也实现了许多重大技术革新，保证了炼钢生产稳步上升。
