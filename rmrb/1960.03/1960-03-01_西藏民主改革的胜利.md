    The Victory of Democratic Reform in Tibet
    Zhang Jingwu
    Tibet is an inseparable part of our great motherland. The Tibetan people are one of the ethnic groups in the great family of the motherland with a long history. They have fulfilled their glorious responsibility in the creation and development of the motherland. However, due to the long-term rule of the feudal serf system and the invasion of imperialism for nearly a century, it is in an extremely backward state in terms of politics, economy, and culture.
    In May 1951, the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. Subsequently, the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, expelling imperialist forces, enabling the Tibetan people to achieve peaceful liberation and enjoy the right to national equality in the great family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Since the peaceful liberation, the Party and the Central People's Government have consistently adhered to the policy of national unity, national equality, gradual realization of national regional autonomy, and gradual realization of democratic reform in Tibet.
    Implementing social reform and taking the socialist road is the inevitable trend of historical development and the common requirement of all ethnic groups in our country. However, due to the different development characteristics of various ethnic groups in our country, the time, steps, and methods for carrying out social reform can be different. The Party's policy of carrying out social reform in Tibet was clearly stipulated in the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The agreement affirmed that Tibet should carry out social reform, and at the same time pointed out that the Tibetan local government should carry out reforms automatically. When the people put forward reform requirements, they should adopt the method of consultation with the upper-level figures in Tibet to resolve them. The Party's policy of peaceful reform fully took into account the development characteristics of the Tibetan ethnic group.
    In the nine years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party's work in Tibet has consistently followed the provisions of the Seventeen-Article Agreement. The Party vigorously carried out anti-imperialist patriotic united front work, carried out patient unity and education of upper-level figures, and united a group of patriotic and progressive upper-level figures. In order to help the Tibetan people gradually realize national regional autonomy, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established. Construction undertakings in Tibet, such as building roads, running schools, establishing hospitals, issuing agricultural loans, disaster relief, and trade work, have all been developed. All these good things that are beneficial to the Tibetan people were started after full consultation with upper-level figures.
    The original Tibetan local government and the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet have always colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, cruelly enslaving and exploiting the Tibetan people. They were unwilling to accept the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and they were firmly opposed to carrying out social reforms in Tibet. They not only opposed anything with reform nature, but even hindered and sabotaged any good deeds done by the Party for the Tibetan people. The central government has always adopted a patient attitude towards these upper-level elements. In order to wait for their awakening, the central government decided at the end of 1956 that no reforms could be carried out in Tibet within six years, that is, before 1962. When to reform in the future will be decided based on the situation in the future. In 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out once again in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "According to the Seventeen-Article Agreement between the Central Government and the Tibetan local government, the reform of the social system must be implemented, but when to implement it must be decided when the majority of the Tibetan people and leading figures believe it is feasible, and cannot be impatient. It has now been decided not to carry out reforms during the second five-year plan period. Whether to carry out reforms during the third five-year plan period will depend on the situation at that time." ① However, despite the central government's patient waiting, the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet not only remained unrepentant, but instead became even more intense, clamoring for "no change at all" and "never change," openly resisting the Party's policy of peaceful reform in Tibet.
    The original Tibetan local government and the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet regarded the central government's patient waiting as weakness and deception. They saw the leap-forward development of socialist transformation and socialist construction in the interior of the motherland and other ethnic minority areas, especially seeing that the Party's ethnic policies were increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in Tibet, and seeing that the awareness of the broad masses of the Tibetan people was constantly improving and urgently demanding reform, realizing that their feudal serf system could no longer be preserved for a long time. In order to maintain this extremely reactionary system and block the path to social reform in Tibet, they colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries and openly launched an all-out armed rebellion in March 1959. Wherever the rebels went, they killed, set fires, raped, and plundered, committing all kinds of evils. They were extremely isolated among the Tibetan people. Not only did the broad masses of Tibetan working people hate and oppose them, but even the patriotic and enlightened elements of the upper class in Tibet did not support them. The Central People's Government, in accordance with the demands of the Tibetan people, ordered the People's Liberation Army to quell the rebellion, and the rebellion was quickly quelled. The Party has always advocated peaceful reform and tried to avoid bloodshed. The reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet attempted to oppose reform by force and create bloodshed. In this way, the reactionary and ugly face of the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet was exposed without a doubt.
    When the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet launched the rebellion, they attempted to raise the banner of the nation, which was only to cover up the essence of their maintaining the interests of the reactionary serf-owner class. Facts have proved that the rebellion and the suppression of the rebellion were by no means a "national war," but a class war, a war launched by a small group of the most reactionary feudal serf-owners to oppose the Communist Party leading the broad masses of serfs to stand up. This was an irreconcilable class war.
    Marxism has always believed that in a class society, the essence of national issues is class issues. Marx and Engels said as early as in the "Communist Manifesto": "As the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end." ② In 1949, the democratic revolution in our country achieved basic victory, overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary government, the common domestic enemy of all ethnic groups, and expelling the imperialist invading forces, the common foreign enemy of all ethnic groups. On this basis, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed. Since then, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, all ethnic groups have united in the great family of the motherland to jointly build a socialist society, and the relations between ethnic groups have completely become new relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and friendship. The reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet attempted to usurp the national flag to carry out rebellious activities, which only further exposed their reactionary essence of betraying the motherland and opposing the people.
    The broad masses of the Tibetan people resolutely opposed the rebellion. They warmly supported and assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, and fought alongside the rebel forces to wipe out bandits, actively building roads and leading the way for the People's Liberation Army, reporting on enemy situations, sending tea and water, transporting supplies, and persuading surrender, etc. Thanks to the active support of the broad masses of the people, our army was invincible, and the rebels were defeated at the first touch, and the rebellion was quickly quelled. The reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet opposed peaceful reform, attempted to maintain the rule of the feudal serf system forever, and conspired to split Tibet from the motherland, openly launching a rebellion. The result was that they lifted a rock and hit their own feet, moving to the opposite side of things, accelerating their own demise, further consolidating the unity of the motherland, and promoting the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.
    Leading the serf class in Tibet to carry out democratic revolution, completely eliminating the feudal serf-owner class, completely liberating the Tibetan people, and transforming feudal serf Tibet into a new Tibet of people's democracy and socialism is the Party's firm and unwavering policy. Since the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet was determined to be an enemy of the people and launched a class war of life and death, in order to completely and ultimately end this war, the Party promptly decided on the policy of "suppressing the rebellion while reforming." This policy is completely correct, completely in line with the demands of the Tibetan people, and greatly encourages the Tibetan people.
    The broad masses of the Tibetan working people have long been urgently demanding reform. This reform was not imposed on the Tibetan people by anyone. The revolution in Tibet was produced by the feudal serf system in Tibet itself. In this social system, there are two major classes, serf-owners and serfs, as well as the remnants of the slave class. In rural Tibet, serf-owners, who account for less than 2% of the population, own all the land and serfs and slaves; serf-owner agents, who account for less than 3% of the population, directly rule the serfs on behalf of the serf-owners; serfs, who account for more than 90% of the population, do not have land ownership and are personally attached to the serf-owners, and more than 70% of their labor income is exploited by the serf-owners; slaves, who account for about 5% of the population, are completely owned by the serf-owners. The serf-owners in Tibet are the three major lords, namely the government (feudal government), temples, and nobles. The three major lords form a united whole, constituting the so-called ruling group of politics and religion. Serf-owners privately set up torture chambers and prisons for serfs, and arbitrarily imposed cruel punishments such as whipping, gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, drawing tendons, and breaking limbs. Serf-owners also forced high-interest loans on serfs, dispatched Ula corvee, and levied exorbitant taxes. The serfs suffered the hardships of cattle and horses and ate the food of pigs and dogs. This extremely backward, reactionary, cruel, and barbaric serf system severely restricted the development of social productive forces in Tibet, resulting in a state of stagnation and decline. If the serf system is not fundamentally overthrown, democratic reforms are not implemented, and productive forces are not liberated, it is fundamentally impossible for Tibet to develop, progress, and prosper. Therefore, the broad masses of the Tibetan working people urgently demand democratic reform.
    As early as after the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Tibet, the Tibetan working people complained to the People's Liberation Army and the working comrades of the local Party organizations about the crimes of the serf system, poured out their urgent desire for reform, sent letters requesting reform wrapped in Hada scarves, and ran around asking about the reform policies and dates. Due to the stubborn obstruction of the original Tibetan local government and the reactionary group of the upper class, this legitimate demand of the Tibetan working people to end their tragic serf life has not been realized. After the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet openly launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to maintain the serf system forever, it was very natural for the Tibetan people to demand the complete suppression of the rebellion and the immediate implementation of democratic reform. At the mass rallies held in various places to quell the rebellion, when the masses denounced the crimes of the rebellious group, they put forward demands for implementing democratic reforms and abolishing the serf system. They anxiously inquired, "When will the reform be implemented?" saying, "If the old system is not reformed, we will not be able to survive." When they learned that the Party had decided to "suppress the rebellion while reforming," they rejoiced with infinite joy that they were about to gain freedom. They enthusiastically cheered: "The sun of happiness shines on our heads, and in our generation, a good life is about to begin!" Now, the Tibetan people have launched an earth-shattering revolutionary struggle, and the broad masses of serfs who have stood up are determined to completely smash the shackles of the serf system that have been weighing on them for many years, and to carry out this revolutionary struggle to liberate themselves to the end.
    When we suppressed the rebellion and carried out democratic reforms in Tibet, imperialists and reactionaries from various countries clamored endlessly about "depriving the Tibetan people of their basic human rights and freedoms" and demanding that we "respect the unique way of life of the Tibetan people." In fact, in any place, no matter how "unique" the way of life is in form, as long as there is an exploitation system and as long as there is class oppression, the oppressed and exploited working masses there will inevitably have the desire to eliminate this exploitation and oppression, and they will sooner or later rise up in revolution. This is the universal law of social development, which has been proven by the history of all ethnic groups at home and abroad. The situation in Tibet is exactly like this. When imperialists and reactionaries from various countries talk about "deprivation," "human rights," and "freedom," and when they talk about the "unique way of life," they dare not explain at all what kind of "human rights" and "freedom" this is and what kind of "way of life" this is. If they are talking about the "human rights" and "freedom" of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, then these have long been completely deprived by the feudal serf-owner class before the revolution in Tibet occurred. Under the past serf system in Tibet, the broad masses of the Tibetan people never enjoyed the slightest bit of basic "human rights" and "freedom," while the serf-owners had the right and freedom to cruelly exploit, oppress, and massacre serfs. What the revolution in Tibet wants to deprive is none other than this right and freedom of the serf-owner class. Only by depriving the serf-owner class of this right and freedom can the broad masses of the people obtain genuine human rights and freedom. The imperialists' clamor for guaranteeing "human rights" and "freedom" is nothing more than an attempt to guarantee the right and freedom of the Tibetan serf-owner class to enslave serfs. Their clamor for respecting the "traditional and unique way of life" is nothing more than wanting us to never touch this barbaric and cannibalistic serf system in Tibet. Let them spread rumors and slander with all their might. The millions of serfs in Tibet have already stood up. They will use their own hands to bury the dark and reactionary serf system and establish a happy and bright democratic and socialist new Tibet.
    In the process of carrying out democratic reforms, the Party still adheres to the policy of peaceful reform that it has always advocated. This policy of peaceful reform is still applicable to upper-level figures who have not participated in the rebellion. The so-called peaceful reform is to implement a redemption policy for the means of production of the lords who have not participated in the rebellion, closely combine the full mobilization of the masses from the bottom up with the consultations with upper-level figures from the top down, completely eliminate the serf system, establish a new Tibet of people's democracy, and then gradually transition Tibet to a socialist society.
    Marx and Lenin both said that under certain historical conditions, it is permissible and beneficial for the proletariat to adopt a redemption policy towards the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Communist Party creatively applied this principle of Marxism-Leninism to the practice of the Chinese revolution, adopted a redemption policy towards the national bourgeoisie, and has achieved great victories. Regarding whether a redemption method can be adopted for the landlord class, Engels said in his book "The Peasant Question in France and Germany": "Whether this expropriation is to be compensated for or not depends, to a great extent, not on us but on the circumstances under which we obtain power, and particularly on the conduct of the landlords themselves." ③ The reason why a redemption policy can be implemented for the lords in Tibet who have not participated in the rebellion is because: the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been reorganized and exercises the functions of the Tibetan local government, and the people have grasped political power in Tibet; in other areas of the motherland besides Taiwan, not only have the democratic revolution and socialist revolution been completed, but socialist construction is also booming, and the 650 million people of the great motherland have given the Tibetan people great encouragement and support; the Party has carried out upper-level united front work in Tibet, uniting and educating patriotic upper-level figures, and these patriotic upper-level figures have stood on the side of safeguarding the unity of the motherland and national unity in the struggle against the rebellion; in particular, the awareness of the working people in Tibet has been unprecedentedly improved under the leadership of the Party; under the trend of the times and the will of the people, upper-level figures are willing to accept the Party's redemption policy and support the democratic revolution.
    In agricultural areas, the current revolutionary task is to fully mobilize the masses, first implement the "three antis and two reductions," namely, anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee, anti-personal dependence, and rent reduction and interest reduction; and second, distribute land, completely destroy the feudal serf system. The land, surplus houses, livestock, agricultural tools, etc. of the serf-owners who have not participated in the rebellion will be redeemed and distributed to the serfs. The land, houses, livestock, agricultural tools, etc. of the serf-owners who have participated in the rebellion will be confiscated and distributed to the serfs.
    During the democratic reform, the Party's main task in pastoral areas is to fully mobilize the masses, launch the "three antis" and "two benefits" (both herdsmen and herdowners benefit) movement, establish people's power, properly arrange the lives of herdsmen, so as to achieve the goal of comprehensive development of the animal husbandry economy. Since the situation in pastoral areas is different from that in agricultural areas, the Party's policy in pastoral areas is that, in addition to confiscating the livestock of rebellious lords and rebellious herdowners and distributing them to the original herders and poor herdsmen, the entire pastoral area will implement a policy of no struggle, no distribution of livestock, no division of classes, and both herdsmen and herdowners benefit, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of the herdsmen for herding and the enthusiasm of the herdowners for managing animal husbandry production.
    The Party's policy on religion is to respect freedom of religious belief and protect patriotic and law-abiding religious believers; but it is necessary to resolutely abolish the feudal privileges and feudal exploitation of temples, and resolutely crack down on all counter-revolutionary activities carried out using religion. The redemption policy is also adopted for the means of production occupied by temples that have not participated in the rebellion.
    The peaceful reform in Tibet is a special form of class struggle, which is carried out on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses to struggle and consulting with upper-level figures from the top down. In the stage of democratic revolution in Tibet, the Party's class line is: rely on poor serfs and slaves, unite middle serfs (including wealthy serfs) and all forces that can be united, attack rebellious and most reactionary serf-owners and serf-owner agents, completely eliminate the feudal serf system, and eliminate the serf-owner class.
    Only by fully mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of the people, raising the awareness of the masses, and making the revolutionary movement a conscious action of the people, forming a great revolutionary mass movement, can the revolution in Tibet achieve great victory. The Party divides the revolution in Tibet into two stages, the first stage is democratic revolution, and the second stage is socialist transformation. In the current stage of democratic revolution, it is divided into two steps, the first step is to implement "three antis and two reductions," and the second step is to redistribute land. The important significance of taking these two steps is to fully mobilize the masses and gradually raise the class consciousness of the masses.
    Marxism has always believed that the people are the creators of history, the people must liberate themselves, and the liberation of the people can never be realized by anyone taking over and doing things on behalf of the masses. The Party's leading role for the people is to point out the correct direction of struggle for the people, inspire the people to do it themselves, and strive for and create their own happy lives. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often taught Party members and cadres to follow the mass line, to believe in the masses, to rely on the masses, to learn from the masses, to consult with the masses on matters, and not to have the style of taking over and doing things on behalf of the masses and forcing orders on the masses. The Party organizations in Tibet strictly followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and conscientiously implemented the Party's mass line in leading the democratic revolution movement in Tibet.
    While quelling the rebellion in various parts of Tibet, Party committees at all levels transferred a large number of Tibetan and Han cadres from various organs and troops and organized work teams or work groups to go to the countryside to participate in the democratic reform movement. They went deep into the countryside, visited the poor and asked about their hardships, listening to the complaints and demands of the broad masses of serfs while investigating and understanding the social and economic conditions in the countryside. In the reform, the cadres learned from the masses to temper themselves while mobilizing the masses to inspire them to liberate themselves. After the work team went to the countryside, the cadres and the masses implemented the "three togethers and one heart" (eat, live, and work with the masses, and be of one heart with the masses), carrying forward the fine traditions of hard work and being one with the masses. The cadres and the masses ate zanba together, slept in cow sheds, pulled weeds and watered the fields, and carried water and swept the floor at home. The cadres publicized the Party's policies to the masses, and the masses poured out the crimes of the serf-owners and their own urgent demands to the cadres. In the movement, a large number of activists emerged. The activists sought advice from the cadres when something happened, and they also came up with ideas for the cadres. The masses generally reflected, "The Communist Party's cadres are truly the cadres of us poor people." Under the leadership of the Party, the "three antis and two reductions" movement was rapidly launched in various places. The masses in various places generally held complaint meetings to pour out their sufferings and dig out the roots of poverty. Serfs who had been treated as cattle and horses all their lives took the stage to complain, their voices filled with tears. The masses themselves burned piles of high-interest debt bonds and smashed the shackles of the Ula corvee system and personal dependence. Peasants in various places rose up one after another to establish their own organizations and formed peasant associations. They seriously discussed the candidates for the peasant associations that would work for them and elected the peasant association members they liked. The masses shouted, "All power to the peasant associations!" The peasant associations led the masses to distribute land, and the land was returned to its old home. This is the victory of the Party's ethnic policy and the policy of peaceful reform in Tibet. Because the Party's policies fully reflected the interests and demands of the masses of the Tibetan people, and because the Party fully mobilized the masses and implemented the mass line in the democratic reform movement in Tibet, the democratic reform movement in Tibet developed rapidly and healthily, and the political awareness of the working people was rapidly improved. Now, in the vast rural areas of Tibet, all the shackles of the serf-owners' rule over the people have been smashed, the prestige of the serf-owners has been completely defeated, the superiority of the working people has been established, and the vast rural areas are everywhere filled with a thriving new atmosphere.
    At present, the situation of the democratic revolution in Tibet is very good. The movement is developing normally, rapidly, healthily, and deeply, and has achieved great victories. There are a total of seventy-eight counties in the entire region (including the four urban districts and two suburban districts of Lhasa City, which are equivalent to county level). According to statistics at the end of January this year, democratic reform movements have been launched in fifty-seven counties with a population of approximately 790,000 in agricultural areas, of which the "three antis and two reductions" movement has been completed in forty counties with a population of approximately 610,000. Among these forty counties, land distribution has been completed in thirty-five counties with a population of approximately 470,000. In addition, the "three antis" and "two benefits" movement is being carried out in twelve counties with a population of approximately 70,000 in pastoral areas. In the vigorous democratic reform movement throughout the region, the broad masses have not only gained complete liberation politically and abolished the relationship of personal dependence, but also gained great economic benefits. As a result of the implementation of the policies of "whoever sows, harvests," "rent reduction and interest reduction," and the abolition of high-interest loans, the masses benefited from approximately 1 billion jin of grain, an average of 1,500 jin per person. In areas where land distribution has been completed, each person has been allocated an average of three and a half "kes" of land (one "ke" is approximately 25 jin, one "ke" of land is land that can sow one "ke" of seeds, approximately equal to one mu). Through struggle, the class consciousness of the masses has been greatly improved, and they sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their leadership. They said, "The sun of the Kashag (referring to the original Tibetan local government) shines on the three major lords and their agents, and the sun of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shines on us poor people." "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have made us the masters of the land."
    With the overthrow of the feudal serf system and the change of production relations, the productive forces of Tibetan society have been greatly liberated, and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants has been unprecedentedly high. At present, a high tide of agricultural production is developing vigorously throughout Tibet. The masses in various places have expressed that they will not delay reform and production, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. This production upsurge is also a mass movement of the broad masses of the people. It is a manifestation of the great creativity of the people in developing production and building a happy new life after overthrowing the feudal serf system. Peasants in various places are actively carrying out winter plowing, accumulating fertilizer, repairing water conservancy, improving agricultural tools, and organizing mutual assistance in production. In many places, farmland was only winter plowed once in previous years, but last year it was generally plowed twice, and some have been plowed three times. Due to being deeply exploited by the lords, Tibetan peasants in the past lacked enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer. Now, fertilizer accumulation competitions are being widely carried out in various regions. Agricultural production mutual aid groups have been organized in large numbers in various places, and in some districts and townships, more than 80% of households have joined agricultural production mutual aid groups, becoming a favorable factor for further developing rural mutual assistance and cooperation movements and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture. In pastoral areas, as a result of the implementation of the "three antis" and "two benefits" policy, the enthusiasm of the herdsmen for herding and the enthusiasm of the herdowners for management have been fully utilized, and it has been basically achieved that both people and livestock are safe, protecting livestock and laying a good foundation for the development of animal husbandry production and the prosperity of both people and livestock. Now, the Tibet region, whether in agricultural or pastoral areas, presents a new scene of vigorous production. With the development of production, the enthusiasm of the masses to study culture has also increased. People's-run primary schools have been widely established in various places, and cultural night schools for adults have been established. The hands that used to serve the serf-owners for a lifetime have picked up books for the first time. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the masses of the Tibetan people not only have the strength to overthrow the feudal serf system that has ruled them for thousands of years, but also have the strength to create a happy and prosperous future.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Tibetan people are continuing to implement the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies, working hard, further strengthening national unity, completely completing the democratic revolution, and working hard to build a new Tibet of people's democracy and socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The bright, happy, and prosperous socialist prospect is attracting the Tibetan people. Looking to the future, the Tibetan people are striding forward along the correct path pointed out by the Party.

    西藏民主改革的胜利
    张经武
    西藏是伟大祖国不可分割的一部分。西藏藏族是祖国各民族大家庭中具有悠久历史的民族之一，它在祖国的缔造和发展上，尽过自己的光荣责任。但是，由于封建农奴制度的长期统治和近百年来帝国主义的侵略，它在政治、经济、文化各方面都处于极为落后的状态。
    1951年5月，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议。接着，人民解放军进驻西藏，驱逐了帝国主义势力，使西藏人民获得和平解放，在祖国各民族的大家庭里享受民族平等的权利。和平解放以来，党和中央人民政府对西藏一贯坚持实行祖国统一、民族团结、民族平等、逐步实现民族区域自治和逐步实现民主改革的政策。
    实行社会改革，走社会主义道路，这是历史发展的必然趋势和我国各族人民的共同要求。但是，由于我国各个民族的发展特点不同，进行社会改革的时间、步骤和方式，是可以有所不同的。党在西藏进行社会改革的方针，在关于和平解放西藏办法的协议中作了明确的规定。协议肯定了西藏应该进行社会改革，同时又指出西藏地方政府应自动进行改革，人民提出改革要求时，得采取和西藏上层人士协商的办法来解决。党的这个和平改革的方针，充分照顾了西藏藏族的发展特点。
    和平解放西藏九年来，党对西藏的工作，一贯遵行十七条协议的规定。党大力开展了反帝爱国统一战线工作，对上层人士进行了耐心的团结教育，团结了一批爱国进步的上层人士。为了帮助西藏人民逐步实行民族区域自治，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。西藏的建设事业如修公路、办学校、设医院、发农贷、救灾和贸易工作等，都有所发展。所有这些对于西藏人民有利的好事情，都是在和上层人士进行充分协商后，才开始进行的。
    原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，一贯同帝国主义和外国反动派狼狈为奸，残酷奴役和剥削西藏人民。他们对西藏的和平解放是不甘心的，对于要在西藏进行社会改革更是坚决反对的。他们不仅反对任何带有改革性质的事情，甚至对党为西藏人民办的其他任何一件好事，也都横加阻挠和破坏。中央对这些上层分子始终采取耐心教育的态度。为了等待他们的觉悟，中央在1956年底曾经决定六年之内，即在1962年以前，在西藏可以不进行改革。以后什么时候改革还要根据将来情况再决定。1957年毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中又一次明确地指出：“按照中央和西藏地方政府的十七条协议，社会制度的改革必须实行，但是何时实行，要待西藏大多数人民群众和领袖人物认为可行的时候，才能作出决定，不能性急。现在已决定在第二个五年计划期间不进行改革。在第三个五年计划期内是否进行改革，要到那时看情况才能决定。”①但是，尽管中央这样耐心等待，西藏上层反动集团不仅仍然执迷不悟，反而变本加厉，叫嚷什么“根本不改”“永远不改”，公然抗拒党对西藏的和平改革方针。
    原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团把中央的耐心等待，视为软弱可欺。他们看到祖国内地和其他民族地区的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的飞跃发展，特别是看到党的民族政策在西藏日益深入人心，看到西藏广大人民群众的觉悟不断提高，迫切要求改革，意识到他们的封建农奴制度将不能再长久地保存下去的时候，为了维护这个极端反动的制度，堵塞住西藏实现社会改革的道路，他们勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，在1959年3月间公然全面地发动武装叛乱。叛匪所到之处，杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，无恶不作。他们在西藏人民中是极端孤立的。不但西藏广大劳动人民痛恨和反对他们，而且西藏上层的爱国开明分子也不支持他们。中央人民政府遵照西藏人民的要求，命令人民解放军讨平叛乱，而叛乱也迅速地被平息了。党一向主张和平改革，尽量避免流血，西藏上层反动集团却妄图以武力反对改革，制造流血事件。这样西藏上层反动集团的反动丑恶的面貌就暴露无遗了。
    西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱时，企图打起民族的幌子，这只是为了掩盖他们维护反动农奴主阶级利益的实质。事实证明，叛乱和平息叛乱绝不是什么“民族战争”，而是一场阶级战争，是一小撮最反动的封建农奴主为了反对共产党领导广大农奴阶级翻身而发动的一场战争，这是一场不可调和的阶级战争。
    马克思主义一向认为：在阶级社会里，民族问题的实质就是阶级问题。马克思和恩格斯早在“共产党宣言”中说过：“人对人的剥削一消灭，民族对民族的剥削就会随之而消灭。民族内部的阶级对抗一消失，民族之间的敌对关系就会随之消失。”②1949年，我国的民主革命取得了基本胜利，打倒了各民族共同的国内敌人国民党反动政府，驱逐了各民族共同的国外敌人帝国主义侵略势力。在这个基础上，中华人民共和国宣告成立。从此，各民族在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，团结在祖国大家庭内，共同建设社会主义社会，民族之间的关系完全变成了平等、团结、互助、友爱的新关系。西藏上层反动集团妄图盗用民族旗号进行叛乱活动，只不过更加暴露出他们背叛祖国、反对人民的反动本质罢了。
    西藏广大人民群众是坚决反对叛乱的，他们热烈拥护和支援人民解放军平息叛乱，并和平叛部队并肩剿匪，积极为人民解放军修路带路、报告匪情、送茶送水、运送物资、招降劝降等等。由于有广大人民群众积极支援，我军就所向披靡，而叛匪就一触即溃，叛乱得以迅速平息。西藏上层反动集团反对和平改革，企图永远维持封建农奴制度的统治，阴谋把西藏从祖国分裂出去，公开发动叛乱，结果是搬起石头打自己的脚，走到了事物的反面，加速了自己的灭亡，更加巩固了祖国的统一，并促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    领导西藏农奴阶级进行民主革命，彻底消灭封建农奴主阶级，彻底解放西藏人民，变封建农奴制度的西藏为人民民主的和社会主义的新西藏，这是党坚定不移的方针。西藏上层反动集团既然坚决与人民为敌，发动了你死我活的阶级战争，为了彻底地最终地结束这场战争，党及时地定出了“边平叛边改革”的方针。这个方针是完全正确的，是完全符合西藏人民的要求的，并且大大鼓舞了西藏人民。
    西藏广大劳动人民早就迫切要求改革了，这个改革不是任何人强加于西藏人民的，西藏的革命是由西藏的封建农奴制度本身所产生的。在这个社会制度里，有农奴主和农奴两大阶级，还有奴隶阶级的残余。在西藏农村中，占人口不到2％的农奴主占有全部的土地和农奴、奴隶；占人口不到3％的农奴主代理人，代表农奴主直接统治农奴；占人口90％以上的农奴，没有土地所有权，人身依附于农奴主，劳动收入的70％以上被农奴主剥削了去；占人口5％左右的奴隶，人身完全为农奴主所占有。西藏的农奴主就是三大领主，即官家（封建政府）、寺庙和贵族。三大领主结成一体，构成了所谓政教合一的统治集团。农奴主对农奴私设刑堂、监狱，随意施行鞭打、挖眼、割鼻、抽筋、断肢等酷刑。农奴主对农奴还强迫放高利贷，支派乌拉差役，横征苛税。农奴们受的是牛马苦，吃的是猪狗食。这个极端落后、反动、残酷、野蛮的农奴制度，使西藏社会生产力的发展，受到了严重的束缚，以致处于一种停滞衰退的状况。如果不从根本上推翻农奴制度，实行民主改革，解放生产力，要想西藏得到发展、进步和繁荣是根本不可能的。所以，西藏广大劳动人民迫切要求民主改革。
    早在西藏和平解放、人民解放军进驻西藏以后，西藏劳动人民就背着农奴主，向人民解放军和地方党组织的工作同志控诉农奴制度的罪恶，倾吐迫切要求改革的愿望，送来用哈达卷着的要求改革的信件，并且奔走相问改革的政策和日期。由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的顽固阻挠，西藏劳动人民这种迫切希望结束悲惨的农奴生活的正当要求，一直未能实现。当西藏上层反动集团妄图永远保持农奴制度而公开发动武装叛乱以后，西藏人民要求彻底平息叛乱和立即实行民主改革，这是很自然的。在各地举行的群众平叛大会上，群众在控诉叛乱集团的罪行的时候，纷纷提出了实行民主改革、废除农奴制度的要求。他们焦灼地打听“什么时候改革？”说：“旧制度再不改革，我们活不下去了。”当他们知道党决定“边平叛、边改革”以后，就怀着无限喜悦的心情庆幸自己即将获得翻身。他们热情欢呼：“幸福的太阳照到了我们头上，在我们这一代，美好的生活就要开始了！”现在，西藏人民已经掀起了一场翻天复地的革命斗争，站起来了的广大农奴群众决心彻底粉碎多少年来压在他们身上的农奴制度的枷锁，把这场解放自己的革命斗争进行到底。
    当我们在西藏平息叛乱和进行民主改革的时候，帝国主义和各国反动派喋喋不休地叫嚷什么“剥夺了西藏人民的基本人权和自由”，要求我们“尊重西藏人民的独特的生活方式”。其实，任何一个地方，不管那里的生活方式在形式上怎样“独特”，只要存在着剥削制度，只要存在着阶级压迫，那里的被压迫被剥削的劳动群众就必然会有解除这种剥削和压迫的愿望，就迟早要起来革命。这是社会发展的普遍规律，是古今中外各民族的历史所已经证明了的。西藏的情况也正是这样。帝国主义和各国反动派在谈到“剥夺”“人权”和“自由”的时候，在谈到“独特的生活方式”的时候，他们一点也不敢说明，这是什么样的“人权”和“自由”，是什么样的“生活方式”。如果说的是西藏广大人民的“人权”和“自由”，那么，在西藏的革命发生以前，这早已被封建农奴主阶级剥夺得干干净净了。在西藏过去的农奴制度下，广大的西藏人民从来没有享受过一点起码的“人权”和“自由”，而农奴主却有残酷地剥削农奴、压迫农奴、屠杀农奴的权利和自由。西藏的革命所要剥夺的不是别的，正是农奴主阶级的这种权利和自由。只有剥夺了农奴主阶级的这种权利和自由，广大人民才能获得真正的做人的权利和自由。帝国主义者叫嚣保障“人权”和“自由”，无非是妄图保障西藏农奴主阶级奴役农奴的权利和自由。他们叫嚷什么要尊重“传统的独特的生活方式”，无非是要我们永远不去触动西藏的这个野蛮的吃人的农奴制度。让他们去声嘶力竭地造谣、诽谤吧，西藏的百万农奴已经站起来了，他们将用自己的双手，埋葬黑暗、反动的农奴制度，建立起幸福光明的民主和社会主义的新西藏。
    在进行民主改革中间，党仍然坚持一向主张的和平改革的方针。这个和平改革的方针，对于未参加叛乱的上层人士还是适用的。所谓和平改革就是对未参加叛乱的领主的生产资料实行赎买政策，把自下而上的充分发动群众和同上层人士自上而下的协商密切结合起来，彻底消灭农奴制度，建立人民民主的新西藏，然后再使西藏逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
    马克思、列宁都曾说过，在一定历史条件下，无产阶级对资产阶级采取赎买政策是可以允许的，并且是有利的。中国共产党把马克思列宁主义这一原理创造性地运用到中国革命的实践中来，对民族资产阶级采取了赎买的政策，并且已取得伟大的胜利。关于对地主阶级可否采取赎买的办法，恩格斯在“法德农民问题”一书中说过：“至于这一剥夺是否要用赎买办法实行，这大半不是决定于我们，而是决定于我们取得政权时的情况，尤其是决定于大土地所有者老爷们自己的行为。”③在西藏对未参加叛乱的领主所以能够实行赎买政策，这是由于：西藏自治区筹备委员会经过改组，行使了西藏地方政府的职权，人民在西藏已经掌握政权；除台湾以外在祖国其他地区，不仅完成了民主革命和社会主义革命，而且正在蓬蓬勃勃地进行社会主义建设，伟大祖国的六亿五千万人民给予了西藏人民以巨大的鼓舞和支援；党在西藏开展了上层统一战线工作，团结教育了爱国上层人士，这些爱国上层人士在反对叛乱的斗争中站在维护祖国统一和民族团结这一边；特别是西藏的劳动人民在党的领导下，觉悟有了空前的提高；在大势所趋、人心所向的形势下，上层人士愿意接受党的赎买政策和拥护民主革命。
    在农业区，当前的革命任务是，通过充分发动群众，第一步实行“三反双减”，即反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役、反对人身依附和减租、减息；第二步分配土地，彻底摧毁封建农奴制度。对未参加叛乱的农奴主的土地和多余房屋、耕畜、农具等实行赎买，分配给农奴所有。对于参加叛乱的农奴主的土地、房屋、耕畜、农具等，则一律没收，分配给农奴所有。
    在民主改革期间，党在牧业区的主要任务是，充分发动群众，开展“三反”和“两利”（牧工牧主两利）运动，建立人民政权，妥善安排牧民生活，以达到全面发展畜牧业经济的目的。由于牧区的情况不同于农业区，党在牧区的方针是，除没收叛乱领主和叛乱牧主的牲畜分给原牧放者及贫苦牧民所有外，对整个牧区实行不斗争、不分配牲畜、不划阶级和牧工、牧主两利的政策，以充分发挥牧工放牧的积极性和牧主经营牧业生产的积极性。
    党在宗教方面的政策是尊重宗教信仰自由，保护爱国守法的宗教信徒；但要坚决废除寺庙的封建特权和封建剥削，并坚决打击利用宗教所进行的一切反革命活动。对未参加叛乱的寺庙所占有的生产资料，同样采取赎买政策。
    西藏的和平改革是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争，是在充分发动群众进行斗争的基础上，和上层人士自上而下协商进行的。在西藏民主革命阶段，党的阶级路线是：依靠贫苦农奴和奴隶，团结中等农奴（包括富裕农奴）和一切可能团结的力量，打击叛乱的和最反动的农奴主和农奴主代理人，彻底消灭封建农奴制度，消灭农奴主阶级。
    只有把广大人民群众充分发动和组织起来，提高群众的觉悟，使革命运动成为人民群众自觉的行动，形成伟大的革命的群众运动，西藏的革命才能取得伟大胜利。党把西藏的革命分为两个阶段，第一阶段是民主革命，第二阶段是社会主义改造。在当前民主革命的阶段里，又分为两个步骤，第一步是实行“三反双减”，第二步再分配土地。这样分两步走的重要意义就是为了充分发动群众，逐步提高群众的阶级觉悟。
    马克思主义一向认为，人民群众是历史的创造者，人民群众必须由自己来解放自己，人民群众的解放决不是由任何人站在群众之上来包办代替所能实现的。党对人民群众的领导作用就是给人民群众指出正确的斗争方向，启发人民群众自己动手，争取和创造自己的幸福生活。党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导党员和干部要走群众路线，要相信群众，依靠群众，向群众学习，有事和群众商量，对群众不能有包办代替和强迫命令的作风。西藏地区的党组织，在领导西藏地区的民主革命运动中，严格遵照了党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，认真贯彻了党的群众路线。
    西藏各地在平息叛乱的同时，各级党委从各机关部队抽调大批藏族和汉族干部，组织了工作队或工作组，下乡参加民主改革运动。他们深入农村，访贫问苦，一面倾听广大农奴的诉苦和要求，一面调查了解农村的社会经济情况。干部在改革中一面向群众学习，锻炼自己，一面发动群众，启发群众自己解放自己。工作队下乡后，干部和群众实行“三同一交”（和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，和群众交心），发扬了艰苦朴素和同群众打成一片的优良传统，干部和群众一起吃糌粑，睡牛棚，到田里拔草灌水，在家里背水扫地。干部向群众宣传党的政策，群众向干部倾诉农奴主的罪恶和自己的迫切要求。在运动中，大批积极分子涌现出来了。积极分子有事找干部出主意，他们也给干部想办法。群众普遍反映说：“共产党的干部，才真是我们穷人的干部。”在党的领导下，各地“三反双减”运动迅速展开。各地群众普遍召开吐苦水、挖穷根的诉苦大会，过去一辈子当牛做马的农奴，登台诉苦，声泪俱下。群众自己烧毁了成堆的高利贷债券，粉碎了乌拉差役制度和人身依附的枷锁。各地农民纷纷起来，建立自己的组织，成立了农民协会。他们认真地讨论了为自己办事的农民协会的候选人，选出了自己所喜欢的农民协会委员。群众高呼：“一切权利归农民协会！”农民协会领导群众分配了土地，土地还了老家。这是党的民族政策和和平改革的方针在西藏的胜利。由于党的政策充分反映了西藏人民群众的利益和要求，由于党在西藏民主改革运动中充分发动了群众和贯彻了群众路线，西藏民主改革运动发展得既迅速又健康，劳动人民的政治觉悟得到了迅速的提高。现在，西藏广大农村里，过去农奴主统治人民的一切枷锁都被粉碎了，农奴主的威风被彻底打垮了，劳动人民群众的优势已经树立起来了，广大农村到处是一片欣欣向荣的新气象。
    目前，西藏民主革命的形势很好，运动正在正常地迅速地健康地深入发展，并且已经取得重大胜利。全区共计七十八个县（包括拉萨市相当县级的四个城区、两个郊区）。根据今年1月底的统计，在农业区现在已有五十七个县约七十九万人口的地区开展了民主改革运动，其中有四十个县约六十一万人口的地区完成了“三反双减”运动，在这四十个县中，已有三十五个县约四十七万人口的地区完成了土地分配。另在牧业区的十二个县约七万人口的地区正在开展“三反”和“两利”运动。在全区轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动中，广大群众不仅在政治上获得了彻底解放，废除了人身依附关系，而且在经济上也获得了很大的利益。由于实行“谁种谁收”“减租减息”和废除高利贷等政策的结果，群众得益约合粮食十亿多斤，每人平均一千五百斤。在完成了分配土地的地区，每人平均分得了三克半土地（一克约二十五斤，一克土地即是能播种一克种子的土地，约合一亩）。通过斗争，群众的阶级觉悟大大提高，他们由衷地感激党和毛主席的领导。他们说：“噶厦（指原西藏地方政府）的太阳照在三大领主和他们的代理人的身上，共产党和毛主席的太阳照在我们穷人身上。”“共产党和毛主席使我们变成了土地的主人。”
    随着封建农奴制度的被推翻和生产关系的改变，西藏社会的生产力大大解放，广大农民群众的生产热情空前高涨。目前，西藏全区的农业生产高潮正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着。各地群众纷纷表示要做到改革和生产两不误，争取今年农业生产大丰收。这个生产热潮也是一个广大人民群众的运动，它是人民群众继推翻封建农奴制度后，在发展生产、建设幸福新生活方面的一种伟大创造力的表现。各地农民积极进行冬耕、积肥、整修水利、改良农具、组织生产互助。许多地方的耕地，往年只冬翻一次，去年已普遍翻过两次，有的已翻过三次。由于深受领主剥削，过去西藏农民对于积肥是缺乏积极性的，现在各地区正普遍地开展着积肥竞赛。农业生产互助组已在各地大量地组织起来，有些区乡已有80％以上的农户加入了农业生产互助组，成为将来进一步开展农村互助合作运动、对农业进行社会主义改造的有利因素。在牧业区，实行“三反”和“两利”政策的结果，充分发挥了牧工放牧的积极性和牧主经营的积极性，基本上做到了人畜两安，保护了牲畜，为发展畜牧业生产和人畜两旺打下了良好的基础。现在，西藏地区，无论农业区或牧业区都呈现出一片热火朝天积极生产的新景象。随着生产的发展，群众学习文化的积极性也高涨起来。各地普遍兴办起民办小学，建立了成年人的文化夜校，过去一辈子侍候农奴主的手，第一次拿起了书本。在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，西藏人民群众不但有力量推翻统治了他们千百年的封建农奴制度，更有力量创造美满幸福的未来。
    西藏人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，正在继续贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议的精神，反对右倾，鼓足干劲，更加加强民族团结，彻底完成民主革命，为多快好省地建设人民民主和社会主义的新西藏而努力工作。光明、幸福、繁荣的社会主义的远景，在吸引着西藏人民。西藏人民瞻望着未来，沿着党所指引的正确道路，正大踏步地向前迈进。
