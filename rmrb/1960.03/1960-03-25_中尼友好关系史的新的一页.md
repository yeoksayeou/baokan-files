    The Chinese people are very satisfied and warmly welcome the achievements made by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Koirala of the Kingdom of Nepal after several days of cordial and friendly talks. During the talks, the two sides discussed issues of common concern, especially those related to consolidating and further developing the friendly relations between the two countries, and signed the Sino-Nepalese Agreement on the Boundary Question and the Sino-Nepalese Economic Aid Agreement. At the same time, Prime Minister Koirala expressed his appreciation for the proposal made by our government to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries. The deep friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples has been further consolidated and developed, and a new page has been added to the history of friendly relations between the two countries.
    The Sino-Nepalese boundary issue is a problem left over from history that needs to be resolved through consultation between the two sides. There are some discrepancies in the entire boundary line between the two countries, which have not been scientifically drawn and formally demarcated. However, China and Nepal have always respected the existing traditional customary line and lived in harmony. In these talks, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and in the spirit of fairness, reasonableness, and mutual concession, friendly consultations were conducted, and finally an agreement on the boundary issue between the two countries was concluded. In the agreement, both parties decided to deal with three different situations separately, based on the existing traditional customary line, or according to the consistent drawing on the maps of the two countries, or according to the actual terrain and the actual jurisdiction of both parties, or in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, friendship and mutual concession, the joint committee will conduct on-the-spot surveys and investigations to determine the boundaries of the two countries and set up boundary markers. The two sides also agreed that, in order to ensure peace and friendship on the border, each side will not send armed personnel to patrol within 20 kilometers of its side of the boundary, except for administrative personnel and civil police. The Chinese government has always maintained that the historical background and current actual conditions should be considered, and the boundary issues between China and its neighboring countries should be comprehensively resolved through friendly consultations in accordance with the Five Principles, and the status quo should be maintained before the boundary is formally demarcated. We are pleased to see that the Nepalese government has also adopted the same position, thus resolving the boundary issue between the two countries. This powerfully proves that as long as both sides proceed from the common desire to safeguard independence and peace, proceed from the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, attach importance to friendship, and attach importance to the continuous consolidation and development of mutual friendly relations, then any outstanding disputes between Asian countries can be resolved, and the unity and friendship between Asian countries can be continuously developed.
    There is a traditional friendship of more than 1,500 years old between China and Nepal . Since establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries, especially since the signing of the Sino-Nepalese Agreement on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Commerce and Communications between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal and the Sino-Nepalese Economic Aid Agreement in 1956, Sino-Nepalese friendly relations have developed satisfactorily. This time, the proposal made by our government to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries has also been appreciated by Prime Minister Koirala. The two sides also agreed to discuss and sign this treaty during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Nepal at his invitation in the near future. We firmly believe that once the lasting peace and close friendship between China and Nepal are fixed in the form of a treaty, it will greatly promote the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and make greater contributions to strengthening Asian peace. At the same time, according to the Economic Aid Agreement signed by China and Nepal this time, China will provide the Nepalese government with unconditional gratuitous assistance totaling 100 million Indian rupees within three years to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. This once again shows that the Chinese people who are carrying out socialist construction are willing to help and cooperate with their friendly neighbor Nepal in accordance with the principles of non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, so as to accelerate the elimination of their respective economic and cultural backwardness and seek common prosperity. In addition, the two countries agreed to establish embassies in Beijing and Kathmandu respectively, which will also help to further strengthen mutual ties and cooperation. All this marks that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal have entered a new stage.
    Following the Sino-Burmese Agreement on the Boundary Question and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression not long ago, the Sino-Nepalese Agreement on the Boundary Question and the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship to be signed are another example of the unity and friendship of Asian countries. This is a new victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and a convincing proof that the Five Principles are full of vitality. Contrary to the wishes of imperialism to use the Sino-Nepalese and Sino-Burmese boundary issues to provoke discord and attempt to fish in troubled waters, China, Nepal and Burma have successfully resolved the boundary issues left over from history, thereby further consolidating and developing their mutual friendly relations. At a time when the international reactionaries headed by US imperialism are piecing together aggressive military blocs in Asia, concluding aggressive military alliance treaties, and carrying out subversion, aggression, and threats of war, China, Burma, and Nepal are jointly striving to promote the spirit of the Five Principles and promote friendly cooperation with each other, which will undoubtedly greatly help the cause of Asian and world peace. This has once again punctured the shameless slanders spread by imperialism, such as "China's expansion and aggression" and the "death" of the Five Principles, and once again attacked the vicious conspiracy of imperialism to create disputes, divisions and conflicts in Asia. We believe that under the shining light of the Five Principles in the Sino-Nepalese and Sino-Burmese Joint Communiqués, the relations of unity and friendship of all Asian countries can overcome all kinds of resistance and achieve increasingly significant development.
    Premier Zhou Enlai of our country pointed out: "Facts have repeatedly proved that among Asian and African countries, as long as they adopt an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual trust, and adhere to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, friendship and mutual concession, there is no problem that cannot be reasonably resolved through peaceful consultation." Prime Minister Koirala also stated: "Let us reaffirm our determination to continue our efforts to strengthen and consolidate the close friendship between our two countries in accordance with the lofty principles of peaceful coexistence." Now, this common belief of the leaders of China and Nepal has once again borne fruitful results after Prime Minister Koirala's visit to our country and the talks between China and Nepal. Prime Minister Koirala's visit has brought the deep friendship of the Nepalese people to the Chinese people, and also saw the sincere wishes of the Chinese people for the Nepalese people. Premier Zhou Enlai's return visit to Nepal in the near future will surely make the friendship between the two countries blossom with new flowers. As confirmed in the Joint Communiqué, "The continuous development of Sino-Nepalese friendly and cooperative relations not only conforms to the interests of the two peoples, but also conforms to the interests of the unity of Asian countries and world peace." The Chinese people, like the Nepalese people, sincerely hope that the friendship between China and Nepal will stand on the top of the world like the Himalayas and last forever!

### 中尼友好关系史的新的一页

    中尼友好关系史的新的一页
    中国人民以十分满意的心情，热烈欢迎我国总理周恩来和尼泊尔王国首相柯伊拉腊经过几天亲切友好的会谈取得的成就。在会谈中，双方就共同有关的问题，特别是有关巩固和进一步发展两国友好关系问题进行了讨论，签订了中尼关于两国边界问题的协定和中尼经济援助协定，同时，柯伊拉腊首相对我国政府提出的两国缔结和平友好条约的建议表示欣赏。中尼两国人民的深厚友谊从此得到了进一步的巩固和发展，两国友好关系的史册从此增添了新的一页。
    中尼两国的边界问题是历史上遗留下来的一个需要双方协商解决的问题。两国整个边界线存在某些出入，没有科学地画出和正式地标定。但是，中尼两国一向尊重现有的传统习惯线，和睦相处，在这次会谈中又本着和平共处五项原则，根据公平、合理和互让的精神，进行友好协商，终于缔结了关于两国边界问题的协定。双方在协定中决定，将分别三种不同情况，以现有的传统习惯线为基础，或按两国地图上一致的画法，或按实际地形和双方实际管辖情况，或根据平等互利、友好互让的原则，由联合委员会进行实地勘察和查明调整，具体确定两国的边界，并树立界桩。双方并且协议，为了确保边境的安谧和友好，每一方在边界本侧二十公里的地区内除了保持行政人员和民警以外，不再派出武装人员进行巡逻。我国政府一贯主张，应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际状况，根据五项原则，通过友好协商，全面解决我国同邻国之间的边界问题，而在边界正式划定之前维持现状。我们高兴地看到：尼泊尔政府也采取同样的立场，因而使得两国之间的边界问题获得了解决。这有力地证明，只要根据双方维护独立和和平的共同愿望，从和平共处五项原则出发，以友谊为重，以不断巩固和发展相互的友好关系为重，进行友好协商，那末，亚洲国家间的任何悬而未决的争端都是可以解决的，亚洲国家间的团结友好是可以得到不断发展的。
    我国同尼泊尔之间有着一千五百多年的传统友谊。自从两国建立外交关系，特别是在1956年签订了中尼保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定和中尼经济援助协定以来，中尼友好关系有了令人满意的发展。这次，我国政府提出的两国缔结和平友好条约的建议，又得到了柯伊拉腊首相的欣赏。双方并且同意将在我国周恩来总理不久应邀访问尼泊尔期间，讨论和签订这个条约。我们深信，中尼两国间的持久和平和亲密友谊一旦用条约的形式固定下来，就必将大大促进两国的友好合作关系，并且对加强亚洲和平作出更大的贡献。同时，根据中尼两国这次签订的经济援助协定，中国将在三年期间提供尼泊尔政府总值一亿印度卢比的不附带任何政治条件的无偿援助，以加强两国的经济合作。这又一次表明了正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民，愿意根据互不干涉内政和平等互利的原则，同自己的友好邻邦尼泊尔相互帮助，进行合作，以加速摆脱各自经济上和文化上的落后状态，求得共同的繁荣。此外，两国同意在北京和加德满都互设大使馆，这一决定也有利于进一步加强相互的联系和合作。这一切都标志着：中尼友好合作关系进入了新的阶段。
    中尼两国关于边界问题的协定和行将签订的中尼和平友好条约是继不久前中缅关于边界问题的协定和中缅友好和互不侵犯条约之后，亚洲国家团结友好的又一榜样。这是和平共处五项原则的新胜利，也是五项原则充满了生命力的令人信服的证明。同帝国主义利用中尼、中缅边界问题进行挑拨离间、企图混水摸鱼的愿望相反，中尼、中缅两国顺利地解决了历史遗留下来的边界问题，从而进一步巩固和发展了相互的友好关系。在以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派在亚洲拼凑侵略性的军事集团，缔结侵略性的军事同盟条约，进行颠覆、侵略和战争威胁的时候，中国、缅甸和尼泊尔共同努力发扬五项原则的精神，促进相互间的友好合作，这无疑大大有助于亚洲和世界和平事业。这就一次又一次地戳穿了帝国主义大肆散布的所谓“中国的扩张和侵略”、五项原则“死亡了”等等无耻谰言，一次又一次地打击了帝国主义在亚洲制造纠纷、分裂和冲突的恶毒阴谋。我们相信，在中尼、中缅联合公报中放出异采的五项原则的光辉照耀下，所有亚洲国家团结友好的关系，都可以排除各种阻力，取得日益重大的发展。
    我国周恩来总理指出：“事实一再证明，在亚非国家间，只要彼此都采取互相谅解、互相信任的态度，坚持平等互利、友好互让的原则，就没有任何问题不可以通过和平协商求得合理的解决。”柯伊拉腊首相也表示：“让我们重申决心继续努力，根据和平共处的各项崇高原则，来加强和巩固我们两国之间的亲密的友谊”。现在，中尼两国领导人的这个共同信念，经过柯伊拉腊首相的访问我国，和中尼两国的会谈，又一次结出了丰满的果实。柯伊拉腊首相的这次访问，为中国人民带来了尼泊尔人民的深厚情谊，也看到了中国人民对尼泊尔人民的真挚祝愿。不久我国周恩来总理的答访尼泊尔，也一定会使两国的友谊开出新的花朵。正如联合公报所确认的，“中尼友好合作关系的不断发展不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且也符合亚洲各国团结和世界和平的利益”。中国人民同尼泊尔人民一样，衷心地希望中尼两国的友谊，将会像喜马拉雅山一样矗立于世界之巅，万古长青！
