Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, March 21st. Chinese tea planting experts Liu Guoshi and Chen Yuping, who were invited by the Moroccan government to help develop the tea planting industry, gave a brief introduction to their research and investigations at a discussion meeting held at the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture this afternoon.

    At the discussion, they presented a report on the possibility of planting tea trees in Morocco and outlined the prospects for planting tea trees.
    The Moroccan Minister of Agriculture was interested in their report and decided to develop this work based on their report.
    With the help of the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Institute, as well as local officials and people, the Chinese experts found the most favorable locations for planting tea trees in Morocco and experimentally planted tea tree seeds there. The Moroccan people are very interested in being able to plant tea trees on their own land. Many local authorities have expressed the hope of planting tea trees within their own jurisdictions.
    King Mohammed V of Morocco once told Bai Ren, the Chinese Ambassador to Morocco, that he was very concerned about the work of the Chinese experts and hoped that their work would be successful. Green tea is the most popular drink among Moroccans, and the annual import volume is very large. In 1958, Morocco imported 17,000 tons of green tea, worth 7.82 billion Moroccan francs, most of which was imported from China.

    经过实地研究、调查和试种
    我国专家提出发展摩洛哥植茶业的报告
    摩农业大臣决定根据中国专家报告发展植茶业
    新华社拉巴特21日电　应摩洛哥政府邀请前来帮助发展植茶事业的中国植茶专家刘国士和陈禹平，今天下午在摩洛哥农业部召开的一次讨论会上，简短地介绍了他们所进行的研究和调查。
    在讨论会上，他们提出了关于摩洛哥种植茶树的可能性的报告，并且概述了种植茶树的前景。
    摩洛哥农业大臣对他们的报告感到兴趣，并决定根据他们的报告发展这项工作。
    在摩洛哥农业部农业研究所以及当地官员和人民的帮助下，中国专家们在摩洛哥找到了种植茶树最有利的地点，并且在那里试验性地种下了茶树种子。摩洛哥人民对于能在他们自己的土地上种植茶树非常感兴趣。很多地方当局表示希望在他们自己的管辖地区内种植茶树。
    摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世曾告诉中国驻摩洛哥大使白认说，他很关心中国专家的工作，希望他们的工作取得胜利。绿茶是摩洛哥人最喜爱的饮料，每年的进口量很大。在1958年，摩洛哥就进口了一万七千吨绿茶，价值七十八亿二千万摩洛哥法郎，其中的大部分是从中国进口的。
