Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Since the Great Leap Forward, China's science education film and news documentary film industry has flourished, playing a significant role in promoting the Party's policies, disseminating advanced experiences, educating the people, and popularizing cultural and scientific knowledge.

In the past two years, a total of 544 science education films and 2,236 news documentaries have been produced nationwide, equivalent to the total output in the first eight years after liberation. In terms of film quality, both the ideological content and artistic techniques have been greatly improved, and they are increasingly loved by the audience. For example, science education films such as "Ode to the Red Flag," "Triumphant Song of Life," "Large-Area High Yield of Wheat," "Eight-Point Charter for Guaranteed Harvest," "Chinese Ape-Man," "In the Dense Forests of Xishuangbanna," and "Mountain Canal" have all been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of viewers. The documentary "Under the Brilliant Illumination of the General Line" has been seen by over 80 million people, "Contemporary Heroes" by over 70 million people, and "Quelling the Rebellion in Tibet" by over 60 million people. Last year, the screening units in Tianjin held more than 30,000 special screenings of news documentaries and science education films, with an audience of over 33 million, accounting for 22.6% of the total audience. In many places, viewers call news cinemas "amateur universities," "political classrooms," and "technical schools."

The tremendous achievements in science education films and news documentary film industry are the victory of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and the result of strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, mass movements to vigorously develop the film industry have been launched throughout the country. All provinces and autonomous regions, except Tibet, have established their own film studios of varying scales. At present, including the eleven feature film studios, there are a total of thirty-three film studios in the country, twenty-three of which were newly built since 1958. These newly built film studios, adhering to the principle of "building factories while producing," adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to produce many excellent films quickly, efficiently, and economically. Among them, there are more than 1,500 science education films and news documentaries, which quickly and promptly reflect the Great Leap Forward in various places and promote the creative inventions of the masses, promoting the film industry to better serve politics, production, and workers, peasants and soldiers. During the Great Leap Forward, the Shanghai Science Education Film Studio and the August First Film Studio quickly and continuously produced more than 20 films on steelmaking technology, dozens of films on technical revolution in various industries, creative advanced experiences, and agricultural high-yield experiences. Last year, the Central News Documentary Film Studio produced twelve large-scale documentaries and one hundred and four short documentaries. They quickly produced educational films such as "Quelling the Rebellion in Tibet," "Millions of Serfs Stand Up," "Preventing Drought and Fighting Floods," and "Great Friendship." The color short documentary reflecting the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country met with the audience within three days. All these science education films and news documentaries have played a huge role in propaganda and education. For example, after watching the film "Electric Traction Plow," the workers of the Farm Tool Factory of the Flame Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, successfully imitated and produced a power traction plow driven by a locomotive boiler, which increased labor efficiency by five times, could cultivate more than 30 mu of land a day, and could save five labors and twelve animal powers every day. After watching the film "Vigorously Engaging in Technical Revolution," the laborers of the Gushitan Reservoir in Yexian County, Henan Province, broke superstitions, liberated their minds, dared to think and dare to do, and launched a mass movement to vigorously reform tools throughout the construction site. The "Plum Blossom Fish Scale Continuous Ramming Method" they created increased work efficiency by eight and a half times; coupled with the use of other self-made advanced tools, the entire project was completed ahead of schedule.

The local Party committees all attach great importance to the role of science education films and news documentaries, strengthened the construction and production leadership of film studios, not only helped film studios solve problems such as factory sites, financial resources, cadres and equipment, but also conducted a series of specific guidance. Many first secretaries of provincial Party committees personally selected topics, determined themes, revised explanatory words, and conducted reviews after the films were made, so that the ideological and artistic qualities of the films were continuously improved.

    科学教育和新闻纪录电影事业发展快作用大
    教育群众　普及科学知识
    新华社18日讯　我国科学教育电影和新闻纪录电影事业，大跃进以来蓬勃发展，在宣传党的政策、推广先进经验、教育人民群众和普及文化科学技术知识等方面，都发挥了巨大的作用。
    两年来，全国共生产科学教育片五百四十四本，新闻纪录片二千二百三十六本，相当于解放后前八年的产量的总和。影片质量方面，无论是思想内容或艺术技巧都有很大的提高，愈来愈广泛地受到了观众的喜爱。比如，科学教育片“红旗颂”、“生命的凯歌”、“小麦大面积丰收”、“八字宪法保丰收”、
  “中国猿人”、“在西双版纳密林中”、“山上运河”等都受到广大观众的热烈欢迎。纪录片“在总路线的光辉照耀下”的观众达八千多万人次，“当代英雄”的观众达七千多万人次，“平息西藏叛乱”的观众达六千多万人次。天津市放映单位去年举办了三万多次放映新闻纪录片和科学教育片的专场，观众达三千三百多万人次，占全部观众数字的22．6％。许多地方的观众把新闻电影院称作“业余大学”、“政治课堂”、“技术学校”。
    科学教育电影和新闻纪录电影事业获得巨大成绩，是党的总路线和毛泽东文艺思想的胜利，是加强党的领导、坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的结果。1958年大跃进以来，各地掀起了大办电影事业的群众运动，各省和自治区，除西藏外，都分别建立了自己的不同规模的电影制片厂。目前，全国连十一个故事片厂在内，共有电影制片厂三十三个，其中二十三个厂是1958年以来新建的。这些新建的制片厂，本着“边建厂、边生产”的方针，采取土洋结合的方法，多快好省地摄制了许多优秀影片。其中，有科学教育片和新闻纪录片一千五百多本，迅速、及时地反映了各地大跃进面貌和推广了群众的创造发明，促进电影事业更好地为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务。上海科学教育电影制片厂和八一电影制片厂，在大跃进中，迅速连续摄制了二十多本有关炼钢炼铁技术的影片，数十本各行各业大闹技术革命、创造先进经验的影片，以及农业丰产经验的影片。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂去年摄制了十二本大型纪录片和一百零四本短纪录片。他们迅速地摄制了“平息西藏叛乱”、“百万农奴站起来”、“防旱抗洪”和“伟大的友谊”等富有教育意义的影片；反映庆祝建国十周年的彩色短纪录片，三天内就和观众见面了。所有这些科学教育片和新闻纪录片，都发挥了巨大的宣传教育作用。如山西汾阳县火焰公社农具厂的工人看过影片“电力牵引犁”以后，模仿制作成功了用锅驼机带动的动力牵引犁，劳动效率提高五倍，一天可耕三十多亩地，每天能节省五个劳力、十二个畜力。河南叶县孤石滩水库的民工看过影片“大闹技术革命”以后，破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢干，使整个工地上掀起了大搞工具改革的群众运动。他们创造的“梅花鱼鳞连环打硪法”，提高工效八倍半；加上采用了其他自制先进工具，使整个工程因而提前完成。
    各地党委都非常重视科学教育片和新闻纪录片的作用，加强了对电影制片厂的建设和生产的领导，不仅帮助制片厂解决厂址、财力、干部和设备等问题，还进行了一系列的具体指导工作。很多省委第一书记亲自选择题材，确定主题，修改说明词，并且在影片制成后进行审查，使影片的思想性、艺术性不断提高。
