Everyone Handles Public Affairs, The Masses Manage Their Own Lives
    Experiences of the Shangxinjie Commercial Department in Nan'an District, Chongqing in Organizing People's Economic Life Under the Unified Leadership of the Party
    Investigation Team of the Finance and Trade Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Shangxinjie in Nan'an District, Chongqing, has a population of over 7,200 households and over 32,000 people, and is the political, economic, and cultural center of Nan'an District. Since the second half of 1958, with the rapid development of socialist construction, many residents of the entire street have successively participated in production, which has brought many new problems to people's daily lives. In particular, after many housewives participated in production and construction, the number of people engaged in housework has relatively decreased, and many workers have felt that their daily life problems such as eating, drinking water, washing clothes, and taking baths are not as convenient as before. This objective situation requires commercial departments to gradually organize social service labor to replace part of housework, in order to meet the various needs of urban people's economic life. According to this general requirement, under the unified leadership of the Party, the entire street, with the commercial department as the main body, relying on the masses, and cooperating with all parties, launched a mass movement to organize people's economic life. The entire work follows the principle of "everyone handles public affairs, the masses manage their own lives," helping the masses to comprehensively arrange, distinguish the priorities, and solve various trivial matters in eating, clothing, using, and housework. After continuous efforts from all parties, this street has basically achieved "three networks" (public canteen network, nursery network, and life service network) and "one -ization" (life collectivization), and the residents' living conditions and mental outlook have undergone great changes.

    Every Household is Busy with Production, No One is Idle

The vast majority of residents in this area have voluntarily organized themselves in terms of work, study, and life, and have begun to get used to collective life. At present, the number of people eating in collective canteens accounts for more than 90% of the total number of residents, and the number of children in nurseries accounts for 80% of all children in the area. Because the problems of eating and taking care of children have been solved, not only have those who originally participated in production been able to work with peace of mind, but also more housewives have walked out of their homes and happily participated in various production and service activities. In the past year, 7,191 residents have participated in production and construction, including 4,378 people who support state-owned enterprises, more than 770 people who engage in street industries, and 2,043 people who engage in street transportation and service industries. Housewives who have the ability to work have jobs, and the remaining semi-labor force and the old and weak are also organized to engage in some minor production and housework. The entire area has achieved "every household is busy with production, and no one is idle."

Most of the residents of Shangxinjie used to only consume and not produce. Now, not only do they produce a lot of non-staple food, but they have also established some street industries that serve large factories and nearby rural areas. In 1959, they produced a total of 4,625 tons of steel protection materials, 700,541 pieces of small commodities, and processed 74,013 pieces of semi-finished products for large factories. At the same time, they accumulated 113,543 yuan in construction funds for the state (profits and taxes turned over), and the tax revenue alone increased by more than double compared with 1958. With the continuous development of street production and service undertakings, the average monthly income per household of residents has reached 60 to 70 yuan, exceeding the living standards of ordinary residents in the city. Originally, there were more than 300 "five-guarantee" households on this street who had to rely on state relief funds to maintain their lives, but now all of them have been solved by the street itself. At the same time, organizing street residents and their families is conducive to carrying out systematic socialist education for the residents, and conducive to mobilizing the masses to participate in various social activities, making the entire street work appear to be a comprehensive leap forward. Now, Shangxinjie is not only a red flag unit for organizing people's economic life in the city, but also an advanced unit in women's work, public security work, and sanitation work.

    People's Mental Outlook is Completely New

The street residents have been tempered by collective labor and collective life, and their mental outlook has undergone tremendous changes. The idea of caring for others and helping others has been universally established, and the spirit of selfless labor and thrift has been greatly promoted. The entire street is a socialist family. The masses are accustomed to thrift and mutual assistance. For example, many people have savings in the bank. In 1959, the total amount of fixed savings in the entire street increased by 2.81 times compared with 1958, with an average of more than five yuan of fixed savings per household. Last year, a total of 277 service projects were opened in the entire street, of which 244 were voluntary services. At the same time, 300 domestic service workers were organized (each person is responsible for 23 families), specializing in providing services for the elderly, weak, sick, disabled, and young. Helping people in need and solving people's difficulties has begun to become a social trend.

Shangxinjie used to run a cultural school, but because many women were busy with housework, they came and went from time to time, and the teaching work was also intermittent. After the realization of life collectivization, people work during work hours and study after work, and cultural learning has become regularized. Now, the entire street has established a middle school and two spare-time schools, and many residents have enrolled. Those who originally did not know a single character have now all shed their illiteracy hats. At the same time, 124 reading groups have been organized, and a reading system has been established, so that a new atmosphere of everyone learning and reading newspapers every day has emerged throughout the street.

The rapid development of Shangxinjie's work in organizing people's economic life has greatly changed the face of the entire street. This reflects an urgent desire of the urban people. They demand to participate in production, develop production faster, and accelerate the socialist construction of our country through certain means. At the same time, it also reflects that the change of production mode will inevitably lead to the change of lifestyle, and this change of lifestyle is first of all the change of distribution relationship. Organizing people's economic life makes the socialist distribution form more perfect, so it has had a positive impact on people's production and life from the beginning. In the future, with the in-depth development of this work, it will also have a greater effect.

The actual situation in Shangxinjie also shows that organizing people's economic life is a further in-depth development of commercial work. Through the education of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, the staff and workers of the commercial department universally regard organizing people's economic life as a glorious task of their own, and regard economic work as political work and mass work, greatly strengthening their political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, improving supply methods, and doing everything possible to serve the masses, thus making commercial work more in-depth into the masses, in-depth into reality, and further embodying the characteristics and advantages of socialist commerce.

From the specific situation of Shangxinjie, the process of organizing people's economic life is the process of the Party constantly caring about the lives of the masses and leading the masses to manage their own lives; it is the process of the masses consciously organizing themselves and embarking on the road of life collectivization; it is the process of constantly developing production, constantly improving the ideological level of the masses, and constantly improving the lives of the masses. Its main content includes three aspects of work, that is: relying on the masses, reasonably distributing goods; organizing the masses to serve themselves, and managing their own lives; organizing residents to participate in production, increasing social wealth, solving market needs, and improving the living standards of residents. Relying on the masses and organizing the rational distribution of goods is one of the important contents of organizing people's economic life.

    Organizing Rational Distribution of Goods is One of the Important Contents of Organizing People's Economic Life

Organizing the rational distribution of goods is an important aspect of organizing people's economic life, and it is also a new supply method that is suitable for the current production situation and the requirements of the masses. Because the socialist national economy is developing proportionally, commerce, as the link between production, distribution, and consumption, must also organize supply and guide consumption under the guidance of the national plan. In the situation that the development speed of production in our country cannot yet adapt to the growth speed of social purchasing power, there will always be some or some commodities that cannot fully meet the needs of the people. Therefore, the most important thing in organizing the supply of goods is to rely on the masses to rationally distribute goods. Through this distribution method, certain special goods can be distributed to the people who need them most on the premise of guaranteeing general needs, and the scattered consumption can be adapted to planned production, so that the work of the commercial department can be more proactive. According to the practice of the Shangxinjie Commercial Department, the key to doing a good job in rationally distributing goods is to grasp three links: First, relying on the strength of the masses, fully understanding the changes in consumption, and effectively grasping the number of people supplied and the consumption characteristics of different types as the main basis for distributing goods. In this regard, the Shangxinjie store has determined that seven people are responsible for consumer research, one person manages approximately 1,000 households or more than 4,000 people. Under the help of street mass organizations, they have achieved "eight knows" (population, number of households, health conditions, pregnancy delivery period, religious beliefs, military families, southerners, northerners), "nine familiar" (lonely, old, sick, disabled, maternity, young children, single workers, old workers, senior technicians), so they are able to have a good idea when distributing goods. Second, determine different distribution methods according to the source situation and consumption needs in each period. The Shangxinjie store summarizes these different distribution methods into general supply (general daily necessities such as soap, matches, etc.), rationed supply (such as festive supplies and certain varieties of planned supply stipulated by the state, etc.), key supply (limited to a few varieties that are in short supply, according to actual needs, determine who should be allocated more and who should be allocated less), adapting to local conditions and flexibly grasping. This not only achieves a universal supply and general arrangement, but also achieves "guaranteeing key points and taking care of special needs." Third, everything is done through the masses and after consultation with everyone to ensure that the distribution of goods is reasonable. For example, the distribution of goods to collective consumption units is done by the store directly holding a forum for collective units, handing over family property, distributing it to factories (schools), and then distributing it to consumers by the collective units. The distribution of goods to residents in the block is done by the representatives of the residents' committee first meeting to study and determine the distribution principle, and then distributing it to households. For certain goods with special needs, it is also possible to unify understanding and carry out distribution through mass consultation as much as possible. Because of adhering to the mass line in the distribution of goods, the masses understand the commodity supply policy and the specific supply situation, and everyone can help each other and try to meet urgent needs, ensuring the smooth progress of the commodity distribution work and embodying the new cooperative relationship between people. Practice has proved that the rational distribution of goods is a new supply method that the masses are happy to accept. Since last year, the total number of goods supplied to consumers by the Shangxinjie store through this method accounts for more than one-third of the total sales of the store. With the active assistance of the masses, many goods have been distributed to the lower sections and delivered to homes, greatly facilitating the needs of consumers.

While carrying out the rational distribution of goods, the Shangxinjie store also paid attention to strengthening the front store supply work. The number of state-owned business outlets increased from the original 48 to 100. With the newly established service stations, there is approximately one business outlet for every 70 households, basically meeting the requirements of the masses and realizing ten things (eating, wearing, mending, washing and dyeing, sewing, daily necessities, sporadic housework, repairing, bathing, and haircutting) without leaving the section. During this period, the commercial department also developed some professional stores, maintained local special flavors and advanced technology, and solved the needs of the masses in many aspects.

    Developing Social Welfare Undertakings, The Broad Masses of Housewives Go to Social Labor Positions

The main content of organizing mass life is to establish "three networks" (public canteen network, nursery network, and self-service network) and realize "one -ization" (life collectivization). The "collective canteen network" is the main one among the "three networks." In this regard, in addition to helping collective units do a good job in meals, the commercial department of Shangxinjie focused its work on street collective canteens. Because the number of people eating in street collective canteens accounts for more than 90% of the total number of people in the street, doing a good job in street collective canteens will also solve the problem of eating for most residents. The collective canteen in Shangxinjie developed in the winter of 1958. After a year of continuous rectification, it has been consolidated. There are 23 canteens, all of which have achieved economic self-sufficiency and have surpluses. Three meals a day, two dry and one thin, two dishes and one soup for lunch and dinner, the residents eat well, eat enough, eat economically, and eat satisfactorily. In running the collective canteen well, the commercial department helped the residents do four things: (1) Make careful calculations and arrange food rations. For example, helping the canteen to increase the rice yield, which is now generally more than 3.5 kilograms of rice per kilogram, ensuring that everyone who eats together can eat enough. Usually, helping the canteen to improve the grain management system, prevent all kinds of loopholes, and achieve planned and controlled expenditures without asking the state for more grain. (2) Help the canteen arrange recipes, implement multiple uses for one dish, making coarse vegetables refined, and allowing the masses to eat a "vegetarian feast" made of beans and dried vegetables once a month, and everyone feels very comfortable. (3) Helping the canteen to come up with various ways to facilitate the masses, such as allowing people to buy as much as they eat, and take rice and vegetables home to cook on Sundays; allowing people who eat together to come to the canteen to cook. At the same time, it also handles business on behalf of customers, and residents can entrust the canteen to make some things they like to eat. Because these measures have been taken, everyone feels that eating in the collective canteen is very convenient. (4) Setting up some small restaurants (selling noodles), cold wine shops, small shops, barbershops, tiger stoves, and simple bathrooms near the canteen, so that the masses not only solve the problem of eating in the canteen, but also solve other life problems. There are many benefits to setting up various supply points with the canteen as the center. The most important is that the supply population is relatively fixed (generally, each canteen has about 400 people who eat together), which is convenient for the commercial department to grasp the consumption situation, arrange labor organization, and solve the needs of the masses.

The nursery network was established with the joint efforts of the commercial department and the Women's Federation. The entire street has now established 39 nurseries and stations of various types, with more than 3,000 children in nurseries, basically realizing nurseryization. In order to adapt to the different requirements of the masses, the admission forms of nurseries and stations are also diverse. They are generally divided into fixed admission and temporary admission. Temporary admission is divided into four forms, namely: temporary nurseries, which solve the problem of taking children when women go out temporarily (such as participating in central work in the district). Mobile nursery station, when holding a conference or concentrated study in the district, goes to the vicinity of the venue to collect children, so that women can attend meetings and study with peace of mind. Timed nursery station, located in traffic arteries and entertainment venues, specializes in serving housewives who have something to go to the city or watch movies; sending children to nurseries, charging by the hour, two cents per hour, one dime per day, and can take care of children's meals. Activity nursery station, organizes children aged three to seven who have not entered the nursery by means of timing, fixed point, and fixed person, teaches them to understand politeness, understand labor, and cultivate children's collective thinking. For children who are fixed in nurseries, the main thing is to constantly strengthen the education of childcare staff, exchange experience in taking care of children at any time, and promptly commend good people and good deeds, so that the work of nurseries (stations) can be continuously consolidated and improved. Since July last year, the children here have not had sores or diseases, and they do not even get prickly heat when the weather is the hottest, and their weight increases every month. The children grow up healthy, and the parents are relieved, and everyone is willing to put their children in the nursery (station).

Because the problems of eating and taking care of children have been solved, the main housework has been socialized. However, with more women participating in production, many trivial housework (such as mending clothes, household hygiene, etc.) require specific arrangements. According to this situation, the commercial department mobilized the masses of residents to engage in self-service on a large scale, forming an all-encompassing mass service network, solving the needs of the masses. In the past year, Shangxinjie has established 18 life service stations, 128 mutual aid groups, and a total of more than 1,200 service personnel. These service organizations are all over the streets and alleys, and the masses praise them very much. The service contents include mending, washing clothes, sewing shoes, polishing shoes, taking care of patients, buying rice and vegetables on behalf of others, cooking on behalf of others, cleaning on behalf of others, and handling weddings and funerals on behalf of others, and so on. In short, all the big and small things in the daily life of the masses are contracted by the service organization, and if they cannot be handled, they are handed over to the store for handling. Most of the service personnel in the service group are women over the age of 50 who cannot directly participate in production. Among them, those who are engaged in consignment sales of goods are given a 2% handling fee by the store every month based on the amount of consignment sales (the income from the handling fee is generally about 15 yuan); those who provide fixed services for certain families are given a few yuan of pocket money by these families every month; those who belong to the nature of mutual service do not receive any remuneration.

Because the "three networks" have been established, not only has the consolidation and development of life collectivization been guaranteed, but also the efficiency of commercial work has been improved. Through the role of the "three networks," the commercial department can use a small number of commercial personnel to do a good job in comprehensive supply and service work.

    Organizing Production Labor is the Fundamental Way to Improve the Lives of Residents

Organizing residents to participate in production is inextricably linked with organizing mass life. In order to use residents' idle labor force, participate in production, and increase supply, it is necessary to organize residents' production; in order to increase residents' income and improve residents' living standards, it is also necessary to organize residents' production. According to the situation in Shangxinjie, the main content of the masses' participation in production is: (1) Non-staple food production. At present, the residents of the entire street have planted 85 mu of vegetables and raised 178 pigs, and are striving to supply the main non-staple foods themselves. (2) Small commodity production. Ten small factories and workshops have been established to process some cotton yarn, towels, cloth blankets, etc. using scrap materials, with an annual output value of approximately 1.6 million yuan. (3) Repair business. Twenty-six repair shops have been established throughout the street, with 366 main business items, and an average of approximately 22,500 items are repaired every month. All residents' production income, except for 80% reserved for wages and expenses, is all used as street public accumulation. According to preliminary calculations last year, by organizing residents' production, the average income per person increased by 26 yuan per month, which has played a great role in improving the lives of residents.

Shangxinjie's organization of the people's economic life has always been carried out under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the District Party Committee, and many things have received strong support from the higher-level Party committees, so problems are solved quickly and thoroughly, the masses are very motivated, and they have always maintained a spirit of continuous leap forward. The work is getting higher and higher, forming a situation of one wave higher than another. The main methods are as follows:

    Strengthen the Unified Leadership of the Party

Establish organizations and unify leadership. Since the second half of 1958, the entire street has been under the unified leadership of the street Party branch. The Shangxinjie District Store is the main body, together with grain stations, banks, vegetable, coal, food, and other stores, as well as representatives from factories, schools, and mass organizations, jointly forming an "Organization of People's Economic Life Committee." The actual work is mainly done by the district store. An office is set up under this comprehensive unit to lead three central service stations. Each central service station has five resident service stations, and each station has several service personnel. This is a line outside the commercial department. Inside the district store, there is an "Organization of People's Economic Life Command," with full-time cadres assigned to contact the central service station. This is a line inside the commercial department. According to the decisions of the street Party branch, the district store grasps the two lines inside and outside, and promotes the entire work from the inside to the outside, thereby smoothly realizing the tasks of organizing people's economic life in each period.

    Strengthen Ideological Education

Strengthen education and unify understanding. Inside the commercial department, the main thing is to strengthen the education of political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, so that they become the guiding ideology for organizing people's economic life. At the same time, combined with actual work, we vigorously talk about the mass viewpoint, requiring commercial staff and workers to go deep into the masses, deep into the streets, understand the lives of the masses, help the masses solve difficulties, and seize typical cases to carry out special debates, strengthen the education of the mass viewpoint, and improve the consciousness of the broad masses of staff and workers. In collective welfare units, the main thing is to strengthen the education of increasing production and practicing economy, emphasizing that in all work, we must establish the idea of "running all undertakings diligently and thriftily," so many tasks are simple and crude, from small to large, first setting up the framework, and gradually improving. This not only solves the urgent needs of the lives of the masses, but also enables the entire work to be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    Engage in Communist Collaboration on a Large Scale

Engage in collaboration on a large scale and unify actions. In organizing people's economic life, Shangxinjie engaged in a mass movement, implementing a large-scale collaboration on one street, clarifying the division of labor, and unifying actions. For example, in addition to being responsible for comprehensively grasping residents' production, life, and education, the street Party branch also focuses on leading residents' production and improving the living standards of the masses. In addition to being fully responsible for organizing residents' production, the district store is also responsible for grasping the service network, points, and helping to run collective canteens well. The grain station is responsible for arranging food rations and improving the quality of meals. In addition to doing a good job in supply, the vegetable and food stores are also responsible for mobilizing the masses to raise pigs and grow vegetables to improve their lives. The Women's Federation is responsible for running the nursery network well. The bank is responsible for solving housing, equipment, and establishing a management system for collective canteens. Factories, mines, institutions, and schools mainly reflect the situation and publicize policies. District and street people's representatives and police stations are responsible for organizing the masses, mobilizing the masses, conducting publicity, and selecting and determining service personnel. All parties divide their labor, but also cooperate with each other, achieving that things have their destination and responsibilities have their specialization, realizing the great leap forward of all walks of life in the entire street, and promoting the comprehensive progress of the work of organizing people's economic life.

    Leap Forward Again and Again

Establish banners and continuously leap forward. In order to continuously promote the various tasks of organizing people's economic life, the Shangxinjie Party organization widely and deeply mobilized the masses and organized the entire street to jointly launch a red flag movement with the central content of "organizing people's economic life." The forms of competition are diverse, including opponent competitions and pacesetter competitions. And a regular summary and evaluation system has been established, with a monthly inspection and summary, and quarterly evaluation and awards. At present, the pacesetters and advanced workers who have emerged account for 20% of the total number of employees. At the same time, attention is also paid to cultivating various types of advanced units and pacesetters. Because the actual actions of these advanced units and pacesetters have influenced the surrounding masses, a "compare, learn, catch up, help" upsurge in organizing people's economic life has emerged. Through various forms of competition, the continuous leap forward of the work of each unit has been promoted.

    大家的事情大家办　群众的生活群众管
    重庆市南岸区上新街商业部门在党的统一领导下组织人民经济生活的经验
    中共重庆市委财贸部调查组
    重庆市南岸区上新街共有居民七千二百多户，三万二千多人，是南岸区的政治、经济、文化中心。自1958年下半年以来，随着社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，全街有很多居民陆续参加了生产，这在人们的日常生活上带来了很多新的问题。特别是很多家庭妇女参加生产建设以后，从事家务劳动的人相对的减少了，许多职工日常生活问题如吃饭、喝水、洗衣服、洗澡等等都感到不如以前方便了。这种客观情况要求商业部门逐步地组织社会的服务性劳动来代替一部分家务劳动，以满足城市人民经济生活上的各种需要。根据这一普遍要求，全街在党的统一领导下，以商业部门为主，依靠群众，协作各方，开展了一个组织人民经济生活的群众运动。整个工作按照大家的事情大家办，群众的生活群众管的原则，帮助群众把吃的、穿的、用的以及家务劳动中的各种琐事进行全面安排，分清缓急，加以解决。经过各方面的不断努力，这条街已经基本上实现了“三网”（公共食堂网、托儿所网、生活服务网）、“一化”（生活集体化），居民的生活情况与精神面貌都起了很大的变化。
    户户忙生产、家家无闲人
    这个地区绝大多数居民已从工作上、学习上、生活上自愿地组织了起来，并且开始习惯于集体生活。目前参加集体食堂吃饭的人数，占居民总数的90％以上，入托儿童占地区内全部儿童的80％。由于解决了群众的吃饭问题和带孩子问题，不但使原来参加生产的人安心工作，而且使更多的家庭妇女走出家门，兴高采烈地参加了各项生产和服务活动。一年以来，有七千一百九十一名居民参加了生产建设，其中支援国营企业的有四千三百七十八人，搞街道工业的有七百七十多人，搞街道运输和服务事业的有二千零四十三人。有劳动能力的家庭妇女都有了工作，剩下的半劳力和老弱也组织起来从事一些轻微的生产和家务劳动。整个地区做到了“户户忙生产，家家无闲人”。
    上新街的大部分居民过去只消费不生产。现在不但生产了很多副食品，而且还兴办了一些为大工厂和附近农村服务的街道工业。1959年共生产了保钢物资四千六百二十五吨，小百货七十万零五千四百一十件，并为大厂加工半成品七万四千零一十三件，同时还为国家积累建设资金（上缴利润和税收）十一万三千五百四十三元，仅税收一项即比1958年增长一倍以上。随着街道生产、服务事业的不断发展，居民每户每月平均收入已达六十至七十元，超过了全市一般居民生活水平。原来这条街有三百多家“五保”户要靠国家发救济金维持生活，现已全部由街道自行解决。同时，把街道居民及家属组织起来，有利于对居民进行系统的社会主义教育，有利于发动群众参加各种社会活动，使整个街道工作出现了全面跃进的情况。现在，上新街不但是全市组织人民经济生活的红旗单位，而且也是妇女工作、治安工作、清洁卫生工作的先进单位。
    人们的精神面貌焕然一新
    街道居民受到集体劳动和集体生活的锻炼，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。关心别人、帮助别人的思想普遍树立了，忘我劳动、勤俭节约的思想大大发扬了，整个街道就是一个社会主义大家庭。群众中节约成习，互助成风。例如很多人在银行有了存款，1959年全街定期储蓄比1958年增加了二点八一倍，每户平均有定期储蓄五元以上。去年全街共开办了二百七十七种服务项目，其中就有二百四十四种都是义务服务。同时，还组织了三百个家务服务员（每一人负责二十三家），专门为一些老弱残幼生活服务。济人之难，解人之困，已经开始成为社会风尚了。
    上新街过去办过文化学校，由于很多妇女忙于家务，时来时去，教学工作也随之时断时续。在实现生活集体化之后，上班时工作，下班时学习，文化学习正规化了。现在全街已办起一所中学和两所业余学校，很多居民都入了学，原来一字不识的人，现在全部摘掉了文盲帽子。同时，还组织了读报组一百二十四个，建立了读报制度，使全街出现了一个人人学习，天天读报的新气象。
    上新街组织人民经济生活工作的迅速发展，大大地改变了整个街道的面貌。这反映了城市人民的一种迫切愿望。他们要求通过一定的方式，使更多的人参加生产，更快地发展生产，加速我国社会主义建设。同时，也反映了生产方式的改变，不可避免地要引起生活方式的改变，而这种生活方式的改变，首先又是分配关系的改变。组织人民经济生活使社会主义分配形式更加完善，因此，它一开始就对人民的生产和生活起了积极的影响。今后随着这一工作的深入进行，它还将发生更大的作用。
    上新街的实际情况还表明了，组织人民经济生活是商业工作进一步深入的发展。通过总路线、大跃进、人民公社的教育，商业部门职工普遍把组织人民经济生活做为本身的一项光荣任务，把经济工作作为政治工作与群众工作来进行，大大加强了政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，改进了供应方法，千方百计地为群众服务，从而使商业工作更加深入群众，深入实际，进一步体现了社会主义商业的特点和优越性。
    从上新街的具体情况来看，组织人民经济生活的过程，是党不断关心群众生活，领导群众自己管理自己生活的过程；是群众自觉地组织起来，走上生活集体化道路的过程；是不断发展生产，不断提高群众思想水平，不断改善群众生活的过程。其主要内容包括三方面的工作，这就是：依靠群众，合理地分配商品；组织群众自我服务，由群众自己管好自己的生活；组织居民参加生产，增加社会财富，解决市场需要，提高居民生活水平。依靠群众，组织商品合理分配，是组织人民经济生活的重要内容之一
    组织商品合理分配，是组织人民经济生活的一个重要方面，也是适合当前生产状况和群众要求的一种新的供应方式。由于社会主义国民经济是按比例发展的，作为生产、分配和消费之间的纽带的商业，也必须在国家计划指导下组织供应，指导消费。在我国目前生产发展速度还不能适应社会购买力增长速度的情况下，总会有这一部分或那一部分商品不能完全满足人民的需要。因此，在组织商品供应中最重要的是依靠群众合理地分配商品，通过这种分配办法，可以在保证一般需要的前提下，把某些特殊商品分配给最需要的人，可以使分散的消费与有计划的生产相适应，可以使商业部门的工作更加主动一些。根据上新街商业部门的实践，做好合理分配商品工作的关键，要抓住三个环节：第一，依靠群众力量，全面了解消费变化情况，切实掌握供应人数及不同类型的消费特点，作为分配商品的主要依据。这一方面，上新街商店确定有七个专人负责消费调查研究工作，一个人大体上管一千户，四千多人，他们在街道群众组织的帮助下，做到了“八知”（人口、户数、健康情况、孕妇分娩期、宗教信仰、军烈属、南方人、北方人），“九熟”（孤、老、病、残、产、幼、单身工人、老工人、高级技术人员），因而在分配商品时能够心中有数。第二，根据各个时期的货源情况和消费需要情况，确定不同的分配办法。上新街商店把这些不同的分配办法归纳为普遍供应（一般日用品如肥皂、火柴等），定量供应（如节日用品和某些国家规定的计划供应品种等），重点供应（限于少数缺销品种，根据实际需要，确定哪些人多分一些，哪些人少分一些），因时制宜，灵活掌握。这样就不仅做到了普遍供应，一般都有安排，而且做到了“保证重点，照顾特需”。第三，一切通过群众，经过大家协商，做到商品分配合情合理。如对集体消费单位分配商品，是由商店直接召开集体单位座谈会，交出家底，分配到厂（校），再由集体单位分配到消费者手中。对地段居民分配商品，是由居民委员会的代表先开会研究确定分配原则，然后分配到户。对某些特殊需要的商品，也尽可能地通过群众协商，统一认识，进行分配。由于在分配商品中坚持走群众路线，使得群众了解了商品供应政策和具体供应情况，大家都能互助互让，尽量满足急需，保证了商品分配工作的顺利进行，体现了人与人之间的新的协作关系。实践证明，合理分配商品是群众乐于接受的一种新的供应方式。去年以来，上新街商店通过这一办法供应给消费者的商品总数，就占全店销售数的三分之一以上。在群众的积极协助下，很多商品实行了下段分配，送货到家，大大地便利了消费者的需要。
    在进行合理分配商品的同时，上新街商店也注意了加强门市供应工作，国营营业点由原来的四十八个增加到一百个，加上新设的服务站，大体上每七十户人家即有一个营业点，基本上适应了群众的要求，实现了十件事情（饮食、穿用、缝补、洗染、缝纫、日用必需品、零星家务、修配、洗澡、理发）不出段。这一时期，商业部门还发展了一些专业门市部，保持了地方上的特殊风味和高级技术，解决了群众多方面的需要。
    发展社会福利事业，广大家庭妇女走上社会劳动岗位
    组织群众生活的主要内容是建立“三网”（公共食堂网、托儿所网、自我服务网），实现“一化”（生活集体化）。“三网”之中又以“集体食堂网”为主。在这方面，上新街商业部门除了帮助集体单位搞好伙食外，工作重点放在街道集体食堂。因为参加街道集体食堂吃饭的人数占全街总人数的90％以上，搞好了街道集体食堂，也就解决了大多数居民的吃饭问题。上新街的集体食堂是在1958年冬季发展起来的，经过一年来的不断整顿，已经巩固下来了。现有食堂二十三个，全部做到了经济自给并有结余。每日三餐，两干一稀，中午、晚上两菜一汤，居民吃得好，吃得饱，吃得省，吃得满意。在办好集体食堂中，商业部门帮助居民做好了四件工作：（1）精打细算，安排口粮。如帮助食堂提高出饭率，现在一般都做到了每斤米出饭三斤半以上，保证了搭伙的人都能吃饱饭。平时则帮助食堂健全粮食管理制度，杜绝各种漏洞，做到了开支有计划、有节制，不向国家多要粮食。（2）帮助食堂安排菜谱，实行一菜多作，粗菜细作，每月还让群众吃得上一次用豆类、干菜做成的“素席”，大家都感到吃得很舒服。（3）帮助食堂想出各种便利群众的办法，如允许吃多少，买多少，星期日可以把饭、菜拿回家去做；允许搭伙人到食堂来做菜。同时还办理了代客加工业务，居民可以委托食堂做一些自己喜欢吃的东西。由于采取了这些措施，所以，大家都感到在集体食堂吃饭很方便。（4）在食堂附近设立了一些小食店（卖面）、冷酒馆、小卖部、理发店、老虎灶、简易浴室等，使得群众不仅在食堂解决了吃饭问题，还解决了其他生活上的问题。以食堂为中心设立各种供应点的好处很多，最主要的是供应人口较为固定（一般每个食堂搭伙人数在四百人左右），便于商业部门掌握消费情况，安排劳动组织，解决群众需要。
    托儿网是在商业部门与妇联的共同努力下建立的。全街现已办了各种托儿所、站三十九个，入托儿童在三千人以上，基本上实现了托儿化。为了适应群众不同的要求，托儿所、站的入托形式也是多种多样的。总的分为固定入托和临时入托两种。临时入托又分为四种形式，即：临时托儿所，解决妇女临时外出（如参加区内中心工作）时带孩子的问题。流动托儿站，在区内开大会或集中学习时，到会场附近收托儿童，让妇女安心开会和学习。计时托儿站，设在交通要道和文娱场所，专为有事进城或看电影的家庭妇女服务；送托儿童，以时计费，每时两分，每天一角，并可以代管孩子吃饭。活动托儿站，对三至七岁未入托的儿童，采取定时、定点、定人的办法加以组织，教他们懂得礼貌，懂得劳动，培养儿童集体思想。对于固定入托的儿童，主要是经常加强保育工作人员的教育，随时交流带孩子的经验，及时表扬好人好事，使托儿所（站）的工作不断得到巩固、提高。从去年7月份起，这里的儿童就未生过疮、害过病，天气最热的时候痱子都不长，并且体重每月均有增加。儿童长得健康，家长放心，大家都愿意把孩子放在托儿所（站）里。
    由于解决了群众的吃饭问题，带孩子问题，使得主要的家务劳动社会化了。但是，随着更多的妇女参加了生产，又提出了很多家务琐事（如补洗衣服、家庭卫生等）要求具体加以安排。根据这一情况，商业部门发动居民群众大搞自我服务，形成了一个包罗万象的群众服务网，解决了群众的需要。一年以来，上新街共建立了生活服务站十八个，互助组一百二十八个，各种服务员共一千二百多人。这些服务组织遍布全街的各个村巷，群众十分称赞。服务内容包括缝补、洗衣、绱鞋、擦鞋、照料病人、代人买米买菜、代人煮饭、代人打扫清洁、代办红白喜事，等等。总之，群众日常生活中的大小事物都由服务组织承包代办，办不了的再交商店办理。服务组的服务人员绝大部分是五十岁以上的、无法直接参加生产的妇女。在她们中间，凡是搞代销商品的，每月由商店按代销额给以2％的手续费（手续费的收入一般十五元左右）；固定为某些家庭服务的，每月由这些家庭贴补几块钱零用；属于互相服务性质的则一律不取报酬。
    由于建立了“三网”，不但保证了生活集体化的巩固和发展，而且提高了商业工作的效率。通过“三网”的作用，商业部门得以少数商业人员作好全面的供应工作与服务工作。
    组织生产劳动，是改善居民生活的根本途径
    组织居民参加生产与组织群众生活有着不可分割的联系。为了利用居民的闲散劳力，参加生产，增加供应，需要组织居民生产；为了增加居民收入，提高居民生活水平，也需要组织居民生产。根据上新街的情况，群众参加生产的主要内容是：（1）副食品生产。目前全街居民已种了八十五亩菜，养了一百七十八头猪，正在努力争取主要副食品供应自给。（2）小百货生产。成立了十个小型厂坊，利用边角废料加工一些棉线、毛巾、布毯等，每年产值约一百六十万元。（3）修配业务。全街办了二十六个修配店，主要业务项目有三百六十六种，每月平均修理物品约二万二千五百件左右。所有居民生产收入，除留出80％作为工资、费用开支外，其余全部作为街道公共积累。根据去年的初步计算，通过组织居民生产，使每人平均每月增加收入二十六元，对于改善居民生活起了很大的作用。
    上新街组织人民经济生活一直是在市委和区委的领导下进行的，很多事情得到了上级党委的大力支持，因而问题解决得快，解决得透，群众干劲很大，始终保持着不断跃进的精神，工作愈跃愈高，形成了一浪高一浪的局面。其主要作法有以下几点：
    加强党的统一领导
    建立组织，统一领导。从1958年下半年以来，全街即在街道党总支的统一领导下，以上新街地区商店为主，会同粮站、银行、蔬菜、煤炭、食品等商店，以及工厂、学校、群众团体代表等共同组成“组织人民经济生活委员会”，实际工作主要是由地区商店来做。在这个综合单位下面设有办公室，领导三个中心服务站，每个中心服务站下面有五个居民服务站，站下面设有若干服务员，这是商业外部的一条线。在地区商店内部设有组织人民经济生活指挥部，派有专职干部与中心服务站取得联系，这是商业内部的一条线。地区商店根据街道党总支的决定，掌握了内外两条线，就把整个工作从内到外推动起来了，从而顺利地实现了各个时期组织人民经济生活的任务。
    加强思想教育
    加强教育，统一认识。在商业内部，主要是加强政治观点、生产观点、群众观点的教育，使之成为组织人民经济生活的指导思想。同时结合实际工作，大讲群众观点，要求商业职工深入群众、深入街道，了解群众生活，帮助群众解决困难，并抓住典型事例，开展专题辩论，加强了群众观点的教育，提高了广大职工的觉悟。在集体福利单位中主要是加强增产节约的教育，强调在一切工作中必须树立“勤俭办一切事业”的思想，因而很多工作都是因陋就简，由小到大，先搭架子，逐步健全。这样既解决了群众生活急需，同时又使整个工作得有计划、有步骤地进行。
    大搞共产主义协作
    大搞协作，统一行动。在组织人民经济生活中，上新街大搞了群众运动，实行了一条街大协作，明确分工，统一行动。如：街道党总支除负责全面抓居民生产、生活、教育外，并重点领导居民生产，提高群众生活水平。地区商店除全面负责组织居民生产外，并负责抓好服务网、点和帮助办好集体食堂。粮站负责安排好口粮，提高伙食质量。蔬菜、食品两商店除作好供应外，并负责发动群众养猪种菜，改善生活。妇联负责办好托儿网。银行负责解决房屋、设备和建立集体食堂的管理制度。厂矿、机关、学校主要是反映情况，宣传政策。区、街人民代表、派出所负责组织群众，发动群众，进行宣传，选择并确定服务人员。各方分工，但又共同协作，做到了事有所归，责有所专，实现了全街各行各业的大跃进，促进了组织人民经济生活的工作全面进展。
    跃进再跃进
    树立旗帜，不断跃进。为了把组织人民经济生活的各项工作不断推向前进，上新街党组织广泛深入地发动群众，组织全街联合开展了以“组织人民经济生活”为中心内容的红旗运动。竞赛的形式多种多样，有对手赛、标兵赛等。并建立了定期总结、评比制度，一月一检查总结，一季评比给奖。目前已涌现出的标兵和先进工作者占职工总数的20％。同时还注意培养了各种类型的先进单位和标兵。由于这些先进单位和标兵的实际行动影响了周围群众，出现了一个在组织人民经济生活上的“比、学、赶、帮”热潮，通过各种竞赛形式，推动了各单位工作的不断跃进。
