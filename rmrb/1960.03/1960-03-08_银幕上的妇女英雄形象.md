Heroic Images of Women on the Silver Screen
Shi Liang, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation

    To commemorate the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Women's Federation jointly held a "March 8th" Film Week. The films screened during this film week fully reflect the great contributions made by women on all fronts during various revolutionary periods, especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, demonstrating that liberated women are an important force in building socialism. These films enthusiastically praise the heroic women of our country who have created heroic deeds in real life.

    Since 1958, under the guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism by going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better and economical results, the broad masses of women in urban and rural areas of our country have universally participated in social labor and become creators of social wealth. In rural areas, women are already a main force in agricultural production; in factories and enterprises, the ranks of female workers have rapidly expanded; in street-run industries, women are the main force; and in collective welfare undertakings and social services, women account for the majority. After participating in collective production and collective welfare undertakings, the broad masses of women have undergone fundamental changes in their spiritual outlook, and their economic, political, social, and family status has been greatly improved. All of this indicates that women in our country have begun to embark on a new stage of complete liberation. The main films of this film week have precisely captured the most typical examples and figures in the lives of women in our country, vividly and profoundly reflecting this historically significant change. "Smiling Faces" and "A Riot of Color is Always Spring" reflect the tremendous changes in all aspects of street housewives after being encouraged by the Great Leap Forward to bravely step out of their families and into social labor. "Five Golden Flowers" reflects the new atmosphere of our sisters of minority nationalities making a Great Leap Forward together in the warm socialist family. "Ice Sisters" and "Blue Sky Silver Flowers" show the growth of the younger generation of our country, reflecting the great ambitions and achievements of women in our country in enhancing their physical fitness and building and defending the motherland.

    The reason why women in our country can achieve such achievements in socialist construction is because they listen to the words of the Party and Chairman Mao, and go wherever the Party points. A group of housewives in "A Riot of Color is Always Spring" and "Smiling Faces" used to be housewives who did not understand any production or technology. Under the guidance and support of the Party and the promotion of the Great Leap Forward, they all moved from the narrow world of their families to the ranks of social labor. The Party's leadership and encouragement enabled them to overcome all difficulties, quickly master technology, make achievements in production and work, and receive the respect and care of society and their families. They deeply understand that all these changes and achievements are due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and therefore they love the Party and Chairman Mao even more. Their love and trust in the Party and Chairman Mao have become an inexhaustible source of strength for them to continue their efforts and strive for greater achievements.

    The broad masses of working women in our country have a high degree of awareness of socialist labor and demonstrate a selfless spirit in production. The five golden flowers in "Five Golden Flowers" are all full of vigor, energy, and a sense of pride in labor and revolutionary optimism. Under the education of the Party, working women in our country, like these five golden flowers, love labor, love life, and are diligent and brave. Such golden flowers are by no means just five, but thousands upon thousands, blooming in every corner of our motherland.

    Among the broad masses of working women in our country, mutual assistance and cooperation have become common practice, and the communist ideology of putting the public interest first and selflessness is greatly promoted.
  "Ice Sisters" and "Blue Sky Silver Flowers" are two films that precisely illustrate the process of the growth of these excellent qualities in the younger generation of our country. Among women in our country, selfless women with collectivist ideas like this are increasing, while selfish women are decreasing.

    These films also reflect the perseverance and tenacity of women in our country in mastering knowledge and technology, proving that women can do anything and do it well.

    These films also reflect the noble moral character of young people and women in our country in handling friendship, love, and family relationships.

    The new films "Jin Yu Ji" and "Youth in the Flames of War" being screened this time, as well as the re-screened old films "Daughter of the Party," "Zhao Yiman," "Hongxia," "Storm Over the South Island," "Red Seeds," and "Song of Youth," not only reflect the active participation of women in our country in the arduous struggles of various revolutionary periods, but also show the indomitable, forward-looking, and heroic deeds of women in our country. After watching these films, we are inspired to think about the past, compare it with the present, and look at the future, making us feel even more that our current happiness has not come easily; our responsibilities for the future are so great.

    The current socialist construction is continuing to leap forward, and women in our country are also continuing to create more and greater achievements in various work posts, and advanced collectives and advanced figures are emerging in greater numbers. Looking forward to the future, we are full of joy and confidence. We must learn from the women martyrs of the past, learn from the advanced figures of the present, rapidly improve our political and ideological awareness, improve our cultural and technical level, actively participate in the production increase and thrift campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, make great contributions, and create miracles. We must also vigorously run collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, more rapidly realize the socialization of housework, and dedicate all our strength to achieving the continued leap forward this year.

    银幕上的妇女英雄形象
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席　史良
    为了纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年，中华人民共和国文化部和中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会联合举办了“三八”节电影周。这次电影周上映的影片充分地反映了在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在各个革命时期，特别是大跃进以来，各个战线上的妇女所作出的伟大贡献，说明了解放了的妇女是建设社会主义的重要力量。这些影片热烈地歌颂了在实际生活中创造了英雄事迹的我国的英雄妇女。
    1958年以来，在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的照耀下，我国城乡广大妇女群众普遍地参加了社会劳动，成为社会财富的创造者。在农村，妇女已经是农业生产上的一支主力军；在工厂企业中，女职工的队伍迅速扩大；在街道民办工业中，妇女是主要的力量；在集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业中，妇女更占多数。广大妇女参加了集体生产和集体生活福利事业之后，在精神面貌方面已经发生了根本的变化，在经济、政治、社会和家庭地位方面都大大地提高了。这一切标明着我国妇女已开始走上了彻底解放的新阶段。这次电影周的主要影片，正是抓住了我国妇女生活中最典型的事例和人物，生动地也深刻地反映了这种具有历史意义的变革。“笑逐颜开”和“万紫千红总是春”，反映了街道家庭妇女在大跃进的鼓舞下，勇敢地走出家庭，投入社会劳动以后在各方面的巨大变化。“五朵金花”反映了我们少数民族的姊妹们，在社会主义的温暖大家庭中，一齐大跃进的新气象。“冰上姐妹”和“碧空银花”显示了我国青年一代的成长，反映了我国妇女在增强体质，建设祖国、保卫祖国的事业中的雄心大志和所获得的成绩。
    我国妇女在社会主义建设中能获得这样的成就是因为她们听党和毛主席的话，党指向哪里就奔向那里。“万紫千红总是春”和“笑逐颜开”中的一群家庭妇女，她们过去是一些什么生产也不懂，什么技术也不会的家庭妇女，在党的引导和支持下，在大跃进的推动下，她们都从家庭的狭小天地投入了社会劳动的行列。党的领导和鼓励，使她们排除了万难，很快地掌握了技术，在生产和工作中做出成绩，受到社会和家庭的尊敬和关怀。她们深深懂得这一切变化，这一切成就的获得，都是中国共产党和毛主席领导得来的，因而对党和毛主席更加热爱。对党和毛主席的热爱与信赖，又成为她们继续努力，争取更大成就的无穷无尽的力量的泉源。
    我国广大的劳动妇女对社会主义劳动有很高的自觉性，在生产中表现了忘我的精神。“五朵金花”中的五位金花，都朝气勃勃，浑身是劲，充满着劳动的自豪感和革命的乐观主义精神。我国劳动妇女在党的教育下正像五朵金花这样的热爱劳动，热爱生活和勤劳勇敢。像这样的金花决不只是五朵，而是千万朵，万万朵，开遍了我们祖国的每一个角落。
    在我国的广大劳动妇女中，互助协作已形成风气，先公后私，舍己为人的共产主义思想大为发扬。
  “冰上姐妹”和“碧空银花”两部片子，正是说明我国青年一代这种优秀品质成长的过程。在我国妇女中，像这种具有集体主义思想的大公无私的妇女正在越来越多，自私自利的妇女，已经越来越少了。
    在这些影片中，还反映了我国妇女掌握知识和技术方面的坚毅和顽强的精神，证明妇女什么也能干，什么也干得好。
    这些影片还反映了我国青年和妇女在处理友谊、爱情和家庭关系方面的崇高的道德风貌。
    这次上映的新片“金玉姬”、“战火中的青春”以及旧片重映的“党的女儿”、“赵一曼”、“红霞”、“南岛风云”、“红色的种子”和“青春之歌”等，不但反映了我国妇女积极地参加了我国各个革命时期的艰苦斗争，而且表现了我国妇女不屈不挠、前仆后继的斗争精神和英雄事迹。看了这些影片，启发我们想想过去，比比现在，看看将来，更觉得我们现在的幸福的得来是多么不容易；我们对未来的责任又是多么重大。
    当前社会主义建设正在继续向前跃进，我国妇女在各个工作岗位上，也继续不断地创造了更多更大的成绩，先进的集体和先进的人物更加大批地涌现出来。瞻望未来，我们充满着喜悦和信心。我们一定向过去的妇女先烈学习，向现在的先进人物学习，迅速地提高政治思想觉悟，提高文化技术水平，积极投入以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，立大功，创奇迹。我们还必须大办集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，更迅速地实现家务劳动社会化，为实现今年的继续跃进献出自己的一切力量。
