    Grasp the Key Link to Bring Along Everything Else
    Cheng Pu
    “Take Grain as the Key Link, Achieve Overall Leap Forward” – though it is only eight characters, in practical work, to arrange the intricate relationship between grain and other crops appropriately, to better reflect taking grain as the key link, bringing along everything else, and achieving overall leap forward, truly requires a lot of arduous and meticulous work.
    To develop grain production at a high speed, and also to develop oil crops, feed crops and other cash crop production at a high speed, this is a glorious and arduous task for the agricultural front under the new situation. We have all the basic conditions necessary to achieve this task. Of course, there are certain contradictions between grain production and other crop production, such as competition for land, fertilizer, and labor. However, under today’s conditions, these contradictions are entirely solvable. The Party's proposal of the policy of taking grain as the key link and achieving overall leap forward requires us to fully utilize the strong manpower and material resources of the people's communes, to fully leverage the superior conditions of the people's communes which are most conducive to developing diverse economies, to correctly handle certain possible contradictions between grain production and other crop production, to increase the production of more grain, and also to increase the production of more cotton, oil, sugar, hemp, tea, tobacco, fruit, medicinal herbs, vegetables, feed, and other agricultural products. Hengfeng County in Jiangxi Province, in order to solve the contradiction of other crops competing for arable land with grain crops, mobilized the masses to "find land, find measures," reclaim mountainous land, and fully utilize scattered idle land, planting oil crops, feed crops, and other cash crops as much as possible on mountainous land and other scattered dry land, freeing up a large amount of paddy fields to expand the planting of grain crops, ensuring a reliable guarantee for both the area of grain crops and the area of other crops. This is an example of correctly implementing the policy of taking grain as the key link and achieving overall leap forward.
    There are contradictions in any work, and the process of work development is a process of constantly discovering and resolving contradictions. To accomplish such a huge task as taking grain as the key link and achieving overall leap forward, it is impossible to avoid the various contradictions that objectively exist in production. The issue is not about having contradictions, but about what attitude to take towards contradictions. Communists should be far-sighted, have a comprehensive understanding, face contradictions squarely, and dare to take revolutionary measures to resolve contradictions in any work they undertake. Hengfeng County wanted to expand the planting area of grain and other crops, but felt that the existing arable land was insufficient. They did not take the easy way out, simply making circles on the existing arable land area, simply allocating the existing arable land according to a certain proportion, thereby weakening grain production or squeezing out other crop production, or failing to advance on both fronts. They took a revolutionary approach. They faced the contradictions squarely, dared to overcome the contradictions, changed the status quo, and took active and progressive measures such as extensively reclaiming mountainous land and fully utilizing scattered idle land, which expanded the county's arable land area, resolved the contradiction of grain crops, oil crops, cash crops, and feed crops competing for land, and also resolved the contradictions of these crops competing for labor and fertilizer. The comrades in this county, with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, created a great situation of grasping the key link to bring along everything else and achieving overall leap forward. From this, it seems that whether or not reasonable arrangements can be made in practical work to ensure the overall leap forward in the production of grain and other crops ultimately depends on whether people truly have the great ambition to develop production at a high speed. With this ambition, fully leveraging subjective initiative, one will not be constrained by contradictions in the work, and will be able to constantly overcome contradictions, break through obstacles, and advance by leaps and bounds.

    纲举目张
    程浦
    以粮为纲，全面跃进，虽然只有八个字，但是要在实际工作中把粮食和其他各种作物之间错综复杂的关系安排得恰到好处，更好地体现以粮为纲，纲举目张，全面跃进，确实需要做很多艰苦的、细致的工作。
    既要高速度地发展粮食生产，又要高速度地发展油料作物、饲料作物和其它经济作物的生产，这是新形势下农业战线的光荣而艰巨的任务。我们有着实现这个任务所必需的一切基本条件。当然，粮食生产和其他作物生产之间是有某些矛盾的，如争土地、肥料、人力等都有一些矛盾。但是，在今天的条件下，这些矛盾是完全可以解决的。党提出以粮为纲全面跃进的方针，就是要求我们充分运用人民公社强大的人力物力，充分发挥人民公社的最便于发展多种经济的优越条件，正确地处理粮食生产和其他作物生产之间可能发生的某些矛盾，增产更多的粮食，同时也增产更多的棉花、油料、糖料、麻类、茶叶、烟叶、水果、药材、蔬菜、饲料以及其他各种农产品。江西省横峰县为了解决其他作物和粮食作物争耕地的矛盾，发动群众“找土地，找措施”，开垦山地，充分利用零星闲散土地，把油料作物、饲料作物和其它经济作物尽量种到山地和其他零星旱地上，腾出大量水田扩种粮食作物，使粮食作物面积和其他作物面积都有了可靠保证。这是正确地贯彻执行以粮为纲全面跃进的方针的一个榜样。
    任何工作中都有矛盾，工作的发展过程就是不断发现矛盾、解决矛盾的过程。要完成以粮为纲全面跃进这样巨大的任务，要想避开生产中客观存在着的各种矛盾是不行的。问题不在于有矛盾，而在于用什么态度去对待矛盾。共产主义者从事任何工作都应当高瞻远瞩，洞察全局，正视矛盾，并且敢于采取革命性的措施去解决矛盾。横峰县要扩大粮食和其他作物的播种面积，但是感到现有耕地不足。他们不是采取省力的办法，只从现有的耕地面积上打圈子，把现有耕地按照某种比例简单分配一下，从而削弱粮食生产或排挤了其他作物生产，或者两方面都不能前进。他们是采取了革命的办法。他们正视矛盾，也勇于克服矛盾，变革现状，采取大量开垦山地充分利用零闲土地这样一些积极进取的措施，使全县的耕地面积扩大了，粮食作物、油料作物、经济作物、饲料作物争地的矛盾解决了，这些作物争劳力、争肥料的矛盾也随着解决了。这个县的同志们是凭着冲天的革命干劲干出了一个纲举目张，全面跃进的大好局面的。这样看来，能不能在实际工作中作出合理的安排，保证粮食和其他作物的生产全面跃进，归根到底还是要看人们是不是真正具有高速度发展生产的雄心大志；有了这种雄心大志，充分发挥了主观能动性，就不会被工作中的矛盾束缚手脚，就能不断地克服矛盾，突破障碍，大踏步前进。
