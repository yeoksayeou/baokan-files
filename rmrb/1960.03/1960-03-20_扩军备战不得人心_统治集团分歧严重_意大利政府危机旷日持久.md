    Expanding Armaments and Preparing for War is Unpopular; Divisions within the Ruling Clique are Serious
    The Italian Government Crisis Lingers
    (By Our Correspondent) Italy's political situation is currently unstable. Since the Seni government fell on February 24th, the Italian government crisis has remained unresolved.
    After the Seni government resigned, President Gronchi has been unable to find a new prime minister candidate capable of forming a government. Gronchi nominated Piziani, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party's parliamentary group in the Senate, to form a cabinet, but this was rejected. It is said that they have different views on how to resolve the government crisis. To date, right-wing party leaders continue to insist on the establishment of a government loyal to the interests of large monopoly capital and the clerical faction. The leadership of the Christian Democratic Party stated that if other parties want to participate in the government, they must agree to continue to implement the "Atlantic and European policies," that is, to follow the United States in stepping up arms expansion and war preparation, and continuing to act as a lackey in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.
    In order to ease popular discontent, the "left" wing within the Christian Democratic Party advocated slightly changing the government's current policies. At the same time, they also advocated wooing Nenni's Socialist Party, attempting to induce the Socialist Party to participate in the government, or at least maintain "benevolent neutrality" in parliament, in order to improve the situation of the Christian Democratic government. However, they have been vigorously obstructed by the right-wing forces within the Christian Democratic Party and other right-wing parties. Recently, the masses of people all over Italy have held rallies, demonstrations, and strikes, demanding that the government crisis be resolved according to their wishes. Most newspapers in Rome believe that, under such circumstances, it is difficult for the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party to resolve the government crisis in the old way, by engaging in this or that kind of collusion with some parties that had previously participated in the government coalition.
    The left-wing forces, led by the Italian Communist Party, and the broad masses of the people have firmly stated that only by changing the reactionary domestic and foreign policies pursued by previous Italian governments can the Italian government crisis be resolved and the Italian political situation be stabilized. The Italian Communist Party has issued several statements on the government crisis recently: A communiqué issued by the leadership of the Italian Communist Party on the 17th pointed out that the Christian Democratic Party is adopting delaying tactics, the purpose of which is to cover up the crux of the problem in the face of public opinion, postpone the moment of making political choices, and hide the growing internal contradictions. The party's leading group is attempting to wait until all parties are exhausted, and then use an ambiguous method to resolve this crisis. The communiqué stated, "A democratic solution to this cabinet crisis must be based on a program that includes correct policy actions and measures, and resolutely ensures that the constitutional provisions regarding the implementation of a peaceful and easing (of the situation) foreign policy are fully implemented."
    The communiqué called on all democratic forces to take action, resolutely struggle, break the resistance of domestic reactionary forces, and enable the crisis to be resolved quickly and democratically.

### 扩军备战不得人心　统治集团分歧严重  意大利政府危机旷日持久

    扩军备战不得人心　统治集团分歧严重
    意大利政府危机旷日持久
    本报讯　意大利的政局正在动荡不定中。从2月24日塞尼政府倒台以后直到现在，意大利的政府危机始终没有得到解决。
    在塞尼政府辞职后，总统格隆基一直没有能够找到一个能拼凑起政府的新总理人选。格隆基曾提名天主教民主党参议院议会党团主席皮齐阿尼组阁，但遭到拒绝。据说，他们两人在如何解决政府危机的问题上有不同的看法。直到目前，右翼政党领袖们仍坚持要成立一个忠于大垄断资本和教权派利益的政府。天主教民主党的领导机构声明：其他政党要参加政府，就必须同意继续执行“大西洋和欧洲政策”，也就是追随美国加紧扩军备战和在北大西洋侵略集团中继续充当小伙计角色的政策。
    为了缓和人民的不满情绪，天主教民主党内的“左”派就主张稍为改变一下政府的现行政策。同时他们还主张拉拢南尼的社会党，企图诱使社会党参加政府，或者至少在议会保持“善意的中立”，以改善天主教民主党政府的处境。但是，他们又受到了天主教民主党内右翼势力和其他右翼政党的竭力阻挠。意大利全国各地人民群众最近纷纷举行集会、游行示威和罢工，要求按照他们的意愿解决政府危机。罗马绝大多数报纸认为，在这样的情况下，天主教民主党领导人很难按照过去的老办法，通过同以前参加政府联盟的一些政党进行这种或那种勾结的办法来解决政府危机。
    以意大利共产党为首的左派力量和广大人民群众已经坚决表示，只有改变意大利历届政府所奉行的反动的内外政策，才能使意大利的政府危机得到解决，使意大利的政局得到稳定。意大利共产党最近多次就政府危机发表声明：意大利共产党领导机构17日发表公报指出，天主教民主党采取拖延手法，它的目的是在舆论面前掩盖问题的所在，推迟作政治抉择的时刻，并且把日益增长的内部矛盾隐藏起来。这个党的领导集团企图等到各方面都拖得疲塌了之后，便用一种暧昧的办法来解决这场危机。公报说，“民主地解决这次内阁危机必须以这样一个纲领为基础，这个纲领包括各项正确的政策行动和措施，并且坚决使宪法中关于执行和平和缓和（局势）的外交政策的规定得到完全的贯彻”。
    公报号召一切民主力量行动起来，坚决斗争，打破国内反动势力的顽抗，使危机得到迅速的和民主的解决。
