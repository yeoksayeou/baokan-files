    The Effect of Pig Manure on Crop Yield Increase and Soil Fertility Improvement
    Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

    Raising Pigs and Accumulating Fertilizer is a Way to Solve the Fertilizer Problem Quickly, Efficiently, and Economically

    Fertilizer is an important component of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and increasing fertilizer application and rational fertilization are fundamental conditions for ensuring increased crop yields. Since the Great Leap Forward, agricultural production has developed rapidly, and increasing fertilizer application has become even more important and urgent in conjunction with close planting, deep plowing, and water conservancy. The nutrients required by crops are mostly absorbed from the soil. Harvesting 1,000 jin of wheat requires the absorption of about 30 jin of nitrogen, 15 jin of phosphate, and 35 jin of potassium oxide from the soil. Opening up fertilizer sources mainly relies on rural organic fertilizers and the development of the chemical fertilizer industry. Rural organic fertilizers are large in quantity and wide in source, and are important fertilizers for agricultural production in our country. The advantage of organic fertilizer is that it is a complete fertilizer. In addition to providing the various nutrients absorbed by crops, it also contains a large amount of organic matter, which can improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil and cultivate soil fertility. Chemical fertilizers are not like this. They can only supplement the deficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients for crops, but cannot replace organic fertilizers. Raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer occupies a very important position both at present and in the future. The instructions issued by the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council on October 24, 1959, pointed out that "the main source of farm manure is the large-scale development of pig raising." This is completely correct.

    A pig is a small organic fertilizer factory. According to the test results of the Animal Husbandry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, a pig can excrete an average of 18 jin of manure per day, including 6 jin of manure and 12 jin of urine; a total of 6,500 jin of manure per year. Together with bedding materials such as litter, one pig can accumulate about 10,000 jin of high-quality pig stable manure a year. Applying 10,000 jin of good pig stable manure to one mu of land can basically solve the fertilizer problem. If every commune, team, and household raises pigs, reaching one pig per mu of land nationwide, the fertilizer needs of farmland will be basically met.

    Pig Manure Contains Nutritional Elements Especially Needed by Crops

    Pig manure is a very good organic fertilizer, containing a large amount of organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that are especially needed by crops. According to the chemical analysis conducted by our institute in cooperation with the Animal Husbandry Research Institute, pig manure contains a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but the nutrient content varies depending on the feed.

    Generally, pig manure contains 0.56% nitrogen, 0.4% phosphate, and 0.44% potassium oxide. Pig urine contains 0.3% nitrogen, 0.12% phosphate, and 0.4% potassium oxide. In this way, the manure excreted by a pig each year contains about 25.7 jin of nitrogen, 15.6 jin of phosphate, and 28.5 jin of potassium oxide. Among them, pig manure contains 12.6 jin of nitrogen, 9.9 jin of phosphate, and 11 jin of potassium oxide. In terms of nitrogen, the total amount excreted from pig urine is higher than that of pig manure when calculated throughout the year. In terms of potassium, pig urine is more than pig manure, while phosphate is higher in pig manure. Therefore, in the process of accumulating fertilizer, pig manure and pig urine should be equally valued and should not be neglected. While vigorously developing pig raising and accumulating fertilizer, the work of accumulating, storing and managing pig manure should be closely combined in order to accumulate more and better fertilizer and give full play to its fertilizer effect.

    Improve the Preservation and Management of Pig Manure

    Nitrogen is the easiest element to lose in pig manure. Most of the nitrogen in pig urine is in the form of urea, which is easily decomposed into ammonia gas and volatilized at room temperature, causing nitrogen loss. During storage, attention must be paid to this. The generally simple and easy method is to use materials rich in water absorption, such as straw, fallen leaves, dry soil, and peat, as bedding in the pigsty to absorb urine and reduce nitrogen loss. According to the test results of our institute, when pig urine is stored alone for 15 days, the nitrogen loss in the urine reaches 87%-94% of the total nitrogen content. The loss in pig manure is less, but it also reaches 17.5%. Therefore, fertilizer preservation is a very important task. The materials for bedding vary according to local conditions. If peat and straw are used as bedding, they should be crushed and chopped to increase the ability to absorb urine, preserve more nitrogen fertilizer, and quickly rot into high-quality stable manure. In areas where straw and peat are lacking for bedding, using soil as bedding is also a good method. According to our institute's test, at 20℃, the effect of soil in preserving nitrogen in pig urine is: if pig urine is not mixed with soil, the nitrogen loss accounts for 81% of the total nitrogen amount after 12 days; if pig manure is not mixed with dry soil, the loss is 12%. The more soil is added, the greater the effect on preserving nitrogen. However, considering the requirements of fertilizer preservation and saving labor, mixing with two to three times the amount of soil is more appropriate.

    Further tests have proven that clay loam soil has a better fertilizer preservation effect than silty loam soil. This is mainly because ammonium carbonate and ammonium ions produced by the decomposition of pig manure can undergo cation exchange with soil colloids and be preserved. Clay loam soil has a higher colloid content and a larger base exchange capacity, so its nitrogen retention capacity is also stronger. According to the experiment, the more soil is mixed, the better the effect on preserving nitrogen, but considering the requirements of fertilizer preservation and appropriately saving the labor of transporting soil, mixing three times the amount of soil is more appropriate. At the same time, using dry soil as bedding can immediately absorb pig manure and urine, which is more effective than using wet soil as bedding.

    When vigorously developing pig raising and accumulating fertilizer, and building pig farms on the fields, attention should be paid to renovating pigsties and pigpens. Where there are stones, stones should be used to pave the bottom. In areas where stones are lacking, three-in-one soil can be used to pave a hard bottom (hard pen) locally. This is a good way to accumulate more stable manure and an important measure to promote the rapid development of livestock. First of all, it accumulates more fertilizer and reduces the loss of manure and urine. A hard pen can accumulate more than twice as much fertilizer as a soft pen (a pen without a paved bottom). A hard pen will not allow pig manure to seep into the soil, and the quality of the accumulated fertilizer is also significantly improved. Hard pens also have the advantages of being easy to clean and wash, keeping the pen clean and hygienic, and reducing epidemics.

    In the mass movement of vigorously engaging in pig raising and accumulating fertilizer, various places have created many experiences in accumulating and preserving fertilizer. The pig farm of Xiaozhan People's Commune in Tianjin, based on Pavlov's principle of conditioned reflex and mastering the laws of pig excrement, uses signals such as shaking bells and blowing whistles to concentrate pigs to excrete manure in a certain place. This is convenient for management, greatly reduces the area and amount of bedding soil, and saves labor. Wangyue People's Commune in Changsha established manure pools at the bottom of the pigsty. When fertilizer is needed, the sluice gate of the manure pool is opened, and the pig manure flows to the field for irrigation. This is also a good method.

    The Yield-Increasing Effect of Applying Pig Manure to Crops

    The fertilizer effect of pig manure is multifaceted. It not only contains various nutrients needed by crops, but also contains rich organic matter, which can cultivate soil fertility, increase the yield of the current crop, and also have a significant yield-increasing effect on the next crop. Our institute conducted two consecutive years of fertilizer effect experiments on the same piece of land. Applying the manure of one pig for four months to one mu of land can increase the yield of corn by 43 jin to 82 jin that year. The fertilizer preservation method has a great relationship with the yield increase effect. Applying the same pig manure and using the method of soil bedding to preserve fertilizer increased the corn yield by 39 jin per mu compared to not using soil bedding to preserve fertilizer. This number is quite large, accounting for about 47% of the yield increase. Continuing to apply pig manure in the second year had a greater yield increase effect than in the first year. Applying 4,000 jin of pig manure per mu increased the corn yield by 134 jin in the first year. Without applying fertilizer in the second year, the residual effect of the first year could still increase the corn yield by 94 jin. Experiments and production practices have proven that the fertilizer effect of pig manure can continue for several years.

    In many areas of our country, due to the continuous application of a large amount of pig manure, soil fertility has been continuously improved, and large-scale, unprecedented high yields have been achieved. In Gangliu Brigade of Gangliu Commune in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, the yield of rice per mu increased to 588 jin in 1955. In 1957, with the continued development of pig raising, the yield of rice per mu increased to 667 jin. In 1958, the pig raising industry was further developed, with an average of one pig's fertilizer per mu of land, plus other yield-increasing measures, the yield of rice per mu jumped to 1,219 jin. In Diangu Brigade of Wangshi Commune in Qingfeng County, Henan Province, due to the annual development of pig raising, the amount of fertilizer applied to cultivated land has been continuously increased, coupled with other yield-increasing measures, and grain production has increased year by year. Examples like this are too numerous to mention.

    The Effect of Pig Manure on Improving Soil Fertility

    Applying pig manure can not only significantly increase crop yield, but also improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil, loosen the soil layer, and cultivate soil fertility. This is because pig manure is rich in organic matter, which produces humus during decomposition; humus can act on soil particles and become granular structured soil. This kind of soil has good air circulation, increased replacement, enhanced water and fertilizer retention capacity, deepened degree of ripening, improved soil cultivation, and can turn barren soil into fertile soil, and fertile soil into oily soil. The decomposition and transformation of organic matter in the soil mainly relies on the action of microorganisms to decompose insoluble fertilizers into nutrients that crops can absorb and supply to crops for absorption. Increasing the application of organic fertilizer increases the nutrients for soil microorganisms and improves the physical and chemical properties of the soil, creating a good environment for microorganisms. This greatly enhances soil microbial activity, improves soil nutrient conditions, and increases soil fertility. Datong Rice Production Team of Hongcheng Commune in Shaowu County, Fujian Province, after achieving one pig per mu of land in 1959, the soil changed from firm to loose, the soil color changed from gray-yellow to oily-black, and the soil aggregate structure also greatly increased due to the large increase in the application of pig manure. In the past, drought would occur after five days without rain, but now drought does not occur after more than ten days without rain. Xinjing Team of Xinjing Production Team of Xinjing Commune in the suburbs of Shanghai used to apply human manure and chemical fertilizers to vegetables for a long time, resulting in soil compaction and stunted vegetable growth. Since 1958, pig manure has been used as base fertilizer and top dressing, combined with the application of human manure and chemical fertilizers, and this situation has been completely changed. Farmers in Zhejiang and southern Anhui use pig manure to improve barren red soil (yellow mud), and the effect is very significant. There are also successful examples of using pig manure to improve barren sandy ginger soil in northern Anhui.

    Because pig manure is rich in organic matter, it produces humic acid during decomposition, which promotes root growth and helps crops absorb nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients in the soil more effectively. Organic matter produces carbon dioxide during decomposition. Increasing the carbon dioxide in the soil can not only strengthen plant photosynthesis, but also greatly help the dissolution of insoluble nutrients in the soil.

    Raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer can achieve multiple benefits. Adding bean cake to coarse feed for pigs, about 70%-80% of the nitrogen and most of the phosphate and potassium oxide will be excreted. After using bean cake as feed for pigs, using pig manure to fertilize fields reduces the fertilizer content slightly compared to directly applying bean cake to fertilize fields, and it is more economical. According to the test results of our institute and the Animal Husbandry Research Institute, adding about 100 jin of bean cake to coarse feed can increase the weight of live pigs by about 25 jin. Using this kind of manure to fertilize fields can also increase the yield of corn kernels by 80 jin compared to applying manure from pigs fed only coarse feed. For other feeds, such as using milk vetch green manure to feed pigs first, and then using pig manure as fertilizer, higher benefits can also be obtained compared to directly using green manure in the field. At present, in order to raise more pigs and raise them well, many communes have actively developed agricultural product processing industries and use industrial product residues to feed pigs. On the one hand, this has prospered the rural processing industry, and also promoted the development of pig raising, improved the quality and quantity of manure, and greatly increased the yield of crops. Vigorously developing the pig raising industry not only greatly increases fertilizer, but also promotes the comprehensive development of the rural economy, improves people's lives, and increases the income of commune members. We must resolutely implement the Party's instructions, strive to achieve one pig per mu of land, accumulate more and better fertilizer, and ensure a greater agricultural harvest.

    猪粪尿对作物增产和提高土壤肥力的作用
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所
    养猪积肥是多快好省地解决肥料问题的途径
    肥料是农业八字宪法的重要组成部分，增施肥料和合理施肥是保证农作物增产的基本条件。大跃进以来，农业生产飞速发展，在密植、深耕和水利化的同时，增施肥料，就显得更加重要和迫切。作物所需的养分大部分是从土壤吸收来的，收获一千斤小麦，就要从土壤里吸收三十斤左右氮素、十五斤左右的磷酸、三十五斤左右的氧化钾。肥源问题的开辟，主要依靠农村有机肥料，发展化学肥料工业。农村有机肥料数量大、肥源广，是我国农业生产的重要肥料。有机肥料的优点在于它是一种完全肥料，除供给作物所吸收的各种养分外，并还含有大量有机质，可以改善土壤理化性质，培养地力。化学肥料就不是这样。它只能补充作物氮、磷、钾等几种养分的不足，而不能代替有机肥料。养猪积肥，无论在目前或将来都占有非常重要的地位。党中央和国务院在1959年10月24日发布的指示中指出，“农家肥料的主要来源是大量发展养猪”。这是完全正确的。
    一头猪就是一个小型有机肥料工厂。根据中国农业科学院畜牧研究所的试验结果，一头猪平均每天可排泄粪尿十八斤，其中粪六斤，尿十二斤；每年合计排泄粪尿六千五百斤。再加上褥草等垫圈物，一头猪一年就可以积制优质猪厩肥一万斤左右。一万斤好的猪厩肥施到一亩地里，就可以基本上解决肥料问题。如果社社队队户户都养猪，达到全国一亩地一头猪，就基本上满足了农田肥料的需要。
    猪粪尿含有农作物特别需要的营养元素
    猪粪尿是一种很好的有机肥料，含有多量的有机质及农作物特别需要的氮、磷、钾等营养元素。根据我所与畜牧研究所合作进行化学分析，猪粪中含有多量的氮、磷、钾，不过由于饲料的不同，养分的含量也有一定的差异。
    一般猪粪含氮素0．56％，磷酸0．4％，氧化钾0．44％。猪尿含氮素0．3％，磷酸0．12％，氧化钾0．4％。这样一头猪每年排出的粪尿，约含氮素二十五点七斤，磷酸十五点六斤，氧化钾二十八点五斤。其中猪粪含氮十二点六斤，磷酸九点九斤，氧化钾十一斤。在氮素方面，按全年计算，从猪尿中排出的总量比猪粪为高，在钾素方面，猪尿多于猪粪，而磷酸则以猪粪含量较高。因此，在积肥过程中，对猪粪和猪尿要同样重视，不可偏废。在大量发展养猪积肥的同时，对猪粪尿的积攒保存，管理工作要紧紧地结合起来，才能积得更多更好的肥料，充分发挥它的肥效。
    改进对猪粪尿保存管理
    猪粪尿中，最易损失的是氮素。猪尿中的氮素大部是尿素形态，尿素在常温下容易分解成氨气而飞散，造成氮素的损失。在贮存时，必须要注意，一般简而易行的办法是，在猪圈中用富于吸收水分的物质，如藁秆、落叶、干土和草炭等作为垫料，以吸收尿液，减少氮素损失。根据我所试验结果，猪尿单独存放十五天，尿中氮损失达总氮量87％—94％，猪粪中的损失较少，但也达17．5％。因此，保肥是一件很重要的工作。垫圈的材料，根据各地条件不同，也有差异，如果用草炭、藁秆作垫料，要把它打碎和切碎，以增加吸收尿汁的能力，保存更多的氮素肥分，并早日沤成质量较高的厩肥。在缺乏藁秆和草炭等作褥草的地方，用土垫圈也是一个好办法。根据我所试验，在20℃情况下，土壤保存猪尿中氮素的效果是：猪尿不加土，十二天损失氮素占全氮数量81％；猪粪不加干土，损失12％。垫土数量越多，对保存氮素的作用也越大。但从保肥的要求和节省劳动力来考虑，以拌二——三倍的土较为适宜。
    又经试验证明，粘壤土保肥作用比粉砂壤土要好些。这主要因为猪粪尿分解生成的碳酸铵和铵离子，可以被土壤胶体进行阳离子交换作用，而被保存下来。粘壤土胶体含量较高，盐基交换量较大，所以保氮能力也较强。根据试验，拌土数越多，对保存氮素的作用也越好，但从保肥的要求和适当的节省运土劳力来考虑，拌土三倍较为适宜。同时用干土垫圈可以立刻将猪粪尿液汁吸取，比用湿土垫圈作用大。
    在高速发展养猪积肥，大建田头养猪场的时候，应注意改建猪圈猪栏。有石料的地方要用石料铺底，在缺乏石料地方可用三合土，就地取材铺成硬底（硬栏），这是多积厩肥的好办法，同时又是促进家畜迅速发展的一项重要措施。首先是积肥多，减少了粪尿流失，硬栏比软栏（没有铺底的栏圈）增加积肥一倍以上。硬栏不会使猪粪尿渗透入土，积的肥料质量也显著提高。硬栏又有便于打扫、冲洗，保持圈内清洁卫生，减少疫病等优点。
    在大搞养猪积肥的群众运动中，各地创造了不少的积肥保肥经验。天津小站人民公社养猪场，根据巴甫洛夫条件反射原理和掌握猪排泄粪尿的规律，用摇铃和吹哨等信号，把猪集中到一定地方排泄粪尿。这样就便于管理，大大减少垫土面积和垫土量，节约了劳动力。长沙望岳人民公社在猪栏底建立粪池，需肥时，打开粪池闸门，猪粪尿便结合灌溉自流到田，也是一项好方法。
    作物施猪粪尿的增产效果
    猪粪尿的肥效是多方面的。它不仅是含有作物所需要的各种养分，还含有丰富的有机质，可以培养地力，使当年作物产量增加，并且对下茬作物也有显著增产作用。我所曾在同一块地上连续举行两年肥效试验。用一头猪四个月的粪尿施在一亩地里，当年可增收玉米四十三斤到八十二斤。保肥方法对增产效果有很大的关系，施用同样的猪粪尿，采用垫土保肥的方法比不垫土保肥的，每亩增收玉米三十九斤。这个数字是相当大的，约为增产量的47％。第二年继续施用猪粪尿，增产效果都比第一年大。每亩施用猪粪四千斤，第一年增收玉米一百三十四斤，第二年不施肥，第一年残效还可增收玉米九十四斤。试验和生产实践都证明，猪粪的肥效可以继续好几年。
    我国不少地区由于连年施用大量猪粪尿，土壤肥力不断提高，获得了大面积的史无前例的高额丰产。广东两阳县岗刘公社岗刘大队，1955年水稻亩产提高到五百八十八斤，1957年随着养猪业的继续发展，水稻亩产又增到六百六十七斤，1958年养猪事业得到了进一步的发展，平均每亩田有一头猪的肥料，再加上其他增产措施，水稻亩产跃到一千二百一十九斤。河南清丰县王什公社点固大队，由于养猪事业的逐年发展，耕地施肥量不断增加，加上其他增产措施，粮食产量年年上升。这样例子，举不胜举。
    猪粪尿对提高土壤肥力的作用
    施用猪粪不但能显著增加农作物产量，而且能够改良土壤的物理化学性状，疏松土层，培养地力。这是因为猪粪中富含有机质，在分解过程中产生腐殖质；腐殖质可以对土粒发生作用，成为团粒结构的土壤。这种土壤空气流通，代换量增加，保水、保肥能力增强，熟化程度加深，土壤耕性改良，并能生土变熟土，熟土变油土。土壤中有机质的分解转化，主要靠微生物的作用，才能把不溶解的肥料分解为作物可吸收的养分，供给作物吸收。增施有机肥料，增加了土壤微生物的养分和改良土壤理化性状，给微生物创造了良好的环境。这就大大增强了土壤微生物活动，改善了土壤的养分条件，提高了土壤肥力。福建省邵武县红城公社大同水稻生产队，1959年实现了一亩地一头猪以后，由于大量增施猪粪尿肥，土壤由坚实变疏松，土色由灰黄变油黑，土壤团粒结构也大大增加。过去五天不雨就旱，变为十多天不雨不旱。上海市郊区新经公社新经生产队新经小队过去种蔬菜长期单纯施用人粪尿和化学肥料，结果使土壤板结，蔬菜有萎缩不长的现象。自1958年起，开始用猪粪尿作基肥、追肥，并结合施用人粪尿和化学肥料，现已完全改变了这种情况。浙江、皖南农民用猪粪尿来改良瘠薄的红土（黄泥），效果很显著。在皖北并且有用猪粪尿来改良瘠薄的砂姜土成功的事例。
    由于猪粪中富含有机质，在分解过程中，产生胡敏酸，促进根系生长，帮助作物更有效地吸收土壤中的氮、磷、钾和其他养分。有机物在分解过程中，产生二氧化碳。增加土壤中的二氧化碳，不但能加强植物光合作用，也对土壤里难溶性养分的溶解有很大帮助。
    养猪积肥可以一举数得。粗饲料加用豆饼喂猪，约有70％—80％的氮素和大部分的磷酸和氧化钾要排泄出来。豆饼作饲料喂猪后，利用猪粪尿肥田，比直接施用豆饼肥田减少肥分不多，而且经济。根据我所和畜牧研究所的试验结果，粗饲料里加用一百斤豆饼约可增加生猪体重二十五斤。用这种粪尿肥田，比施用只用粗饲料喂的猪的粪尿还可以增产玉米籽实八十斤。对其他饲料，如先用紫云英绿肥喂猪，再利用猪粪尿作肥料，较直接用绿肥下田，也获得较高收益。目前，各公社为了多养猪，养好猪，很多公社都积极开展了农产品加工工业，用工业产品渣滓来喂猪，一方面繁荣农村加工工业，同时也促进了养猪事业的发展，提高了粪尿的质量和数量，从而也大大增加了农作物的产量。大力发展养猪事业，不仅大量增加肥料，又能促进农村经济综合发展，改善人民生活，增加社员收入。我们要坚决贯彻执行党的指示，努力实现一亩地一头猪，积攒更多和更好的肥料，保证农业更大丰收。
