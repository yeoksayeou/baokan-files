　　This newspaper reports that, under the leadership and support of the Maojiachong Commune Party Committee in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, Zou Guangju, director of the Hua Mulan Forest Farm, organized more than fifty young female activists and established a "Hua Mulan Forest Farm." From the day the forest farm was established, they began afforestation on a barren hill in the Tianzhuang Brigade. After ten months of hard work, the original rocky barren hill has been covered with green clothes. Their forest farm was rated as a "First-Class Forest Farm" by the province and prefecture.

　　The barren hill of Tianzhuang Brigade covers an area of 387 mu. The soil is poor and the production conditions are very bad. No one has ever planted trees or grains there. The masses call this mountain "Grainless Mountain." When the forest farm was first established, some people thought that "afforestation on barren hills is an urgent task, so it is better to engage in agriculture." In response to these ideological problems, the farm committee explained the importance of developing treasure mountains and greening the motherland, and carried out education by focusing on examples. Under the education of the farm committee, the confidence of the members was enhanced. They expressed that they would cut through thorns, overcome all difficulties, and must make the forest farm rich and colorful.

　　In the march towards the barren hills, the principle of planting according to local conditions was conscientiously implemented. More than 300 mu of timber forest and 70 mu of economic forest were created in different plots according to different soil and terrain.

　　In order to make full use of land fertility, increase grain output, and promote the growth of trees, the members learned from foreign experience and sowed 86 mu of sweet potatoes, peanuts, etc. between the nan bamboo and fir forests. While cultivating crops, the trees benefited a lot, so both the crops and the trees grew very well.

　　Like agriculture, forestry must vigorously develop experimental mountains and boldly innovate. In the vigorous experiment, Zou Guangju, the director of the forest farm, engaged in half a mu of Chinese toon "experimental mountain," and other members engaged in nine mu of toon, fir, bamboo and other "experimental mountains." Through the "experimental mountain," the efficiency and quality of afforestation have been improved. All the planted nan bamboo survived, and the survival rate of Chinese tallow tree reached 99%.

　　Now the surrounding masses are all smiling when they mention the Hua Mulan Forest Farm. They say: "Women are not afraid of difficulties in afforestation, and they can make barren hills wear green garments."

### 造林不怕难　荒山穿绿衫  花木兰林场大搞“试验山”

    造林不怕难　荒山穿绿衫
    花木兰林场大搞“试验山”
    本报讯　湖南汉寿县毛家町公社花木兰林场场长邹光菊在公社党委的领导和支持下，组织了五十多个青年妇女积极分子，成立了一个“花木兰林场”。从林场建立那天开始，他们就在田庄大队的一座贫瘠的荒山上造林，经过十个月苦战，原来岩石裸露的荒山已披上了绿色新装。她们的林场被省和专区评为“甲等林场”。
    田庄大队这座荒山，面积有三百八十七亩，土质贫瘠，生产条件很差，从来没有人植树造林或种植过五谷，群众都称这山为“无粮山”。林场刚建立的时候，有的认为“荒山造林任务紧，不如搞农业”。场委会针对这些思想问题，讲明了开发宝山，绿化祖国的重要意义，并抓住实例进行教育。在场委会的教育下，增强了场员的信心。纷纷表示：披荆斩棘，排除万难，一定要把林场办得丰富多彩。
    在向荒山进军中，认真地贯彻了因地种植的方针，按不同的土质、地势分片造了用材林三百多亩，经济林七十亩。
    为了充分利用地力，增加粮食产量，促进林木生长，场员们学习了外地经验，在楠竹、杉木林间，播种了甘薯、花生等八十六亩。在培育农作物的同时，林木沾了不少光，因此农作物和林木都生长很好。
    林业和农业一样，必须大搞试验山，大胆革新。在大搞试验中，林场场长邹光菊搞了半亩香椿“试验山”，其他场员搞了椿、杉、竹等九亩“试验山”。通过“试验山”造林的工效和质量都提高了，栽的楠竹，全部成活，乌桕的成活率达99％。
    现在周围的群众提起花木兰林场都喜笑颜开了，他们说：“妇女造林不怕难，能叫荒山穿绿衫。”
