    "We must rely on people like us to do it!"
    Yao Renwei
    "The Party has proposed to catch up with or surpass international standards in science in a very short period of time. This depends on people like us to do it. Doing it will bring experience, and doing it will bring achievements." These are a few sentences from a letter written by Comrade Wang Yuanlin, the vice president of the Veterinary Hospital affiliated with Nanjing Agricultural College, who was illiterate before liberation, to the students of the Animal Husbandry Class 101 of Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural School.
    "We must rely on people like us to do it!" This sentence expresses the strongest self-esteem and self-confidence of the working class, and also shows the high sense of responsibility of the working people who, as masters of the country, have a sense of "taking the world as their own responsibility." Wang Yuanlin and many other worker-peasant comrades, precisely because they deeply realize that they are the masters of this country and that building socialism is their own noble responsibility, do not need to ask anyone for help. As long as the Party gives a call, they can go all out for any work task. Comrade Wang Yuanlin was illiterate before liberation. After liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, he studied diligently for seven years, completing the courses that others needed sixteen years to complete, and finally graduated from university last year.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: In order to build socialism, the working class must have its own team of scientific and technological cadres, and must have its own team of professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist-Leninist theorists. What Comrade Wang Yuanlin said, "We must rely on people like us to do it," is to recognize how important the national status of the working class and the working people is today; to recognize what kind of person the Party expects them to become.
    Do it, just do it like this! Please see, on the throne of our culture and science, a Wang Yuanlin has appeared, and thousands upon thousands of Wang Yuanlins are appearing and have already appeared.

### “就要靠我们这些人去干！”

    “就要靠我们这些人去干！”
    姚人为
    “党提出在很短的时间内，在科学水平上赶上或超过国际水平。这就要靠我们这些人去干，干就有经验，干就有成绩。”这是解放前还是文盲、现在是南京农学院附属兽医院的副院长王元林同志给江西省农业学校畜牧一百零一班同学的一封信里说的几句话。
    “就要靠我们这些人去干！”这句话表现了工人阶级最强的自尊心和自信心，也显示了劳动人民作了国家主人就有“以天下为己任”的一种高度的责任感。王元林和许许多多工农同志，就因为深刻地认识到自己是这个国家的主人，建设社会主义是本身的崇高职责。他用不着向谁求告，只要党一声号召，什么工作任务都能全力以赴。王元林同志解放前还是一个文盲，解放以后，在党的培养下，苦学七年，学完了别人需要十六年才能学完的课程，终于在去年大学毕业了。
    刘少奇同志说过：为了建成社会主义，工人阶级必须有自己的科学技术干部队伍，必须有自己的教授、教员、科学家、新闻记者、文学家、艺术家和马克思列宁主义理论家的队伍。王元林同志说的“要靠我们这些人去干”，就是认识到今天工人阶级劳动人民所处的国家地位是何等重要；认识到党所期望于自己的是成为怎样一种人。
    干，就这样干！请看，在我们文化科学的宝座上，出现了一个王元林，而且正在和已经出现成千上万个王元林。
