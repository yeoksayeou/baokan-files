    West Road Pingju Flowers Rebloom

    Recently, the China Pingju Theater excavated and performed the lost West Road Pingju "Night at the Flower Pavilion" in the capital, which was warmly welcomed and praised by the audience; from then on, the art of Pingju has added another beautiful flower. This is another victory for the Party's policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" in opera reform.
    Because West Road Pingju developed in Beijing more than sixty years ago and has unique local characteristics, it is also called "Beijing B蹦 (bèng)".
    "Beijing B蹦" once moved the working people of Beijing with its robust and unconstrained folk style, the tone of folk oral poetry in its repertoire, its soaring and passionate singing, and its beautiful performing arts.
    For example, the well-known poetic drama "Yang Ershe Begging for Alms" is one of the main repertoires of West Road Pingju. Other poetry-rich dramas such as "Selling Water," "Gu Cun Hunting Birds," "Night at the Flower Pavilion," and "Dou E Injustice" number more than sixty. This is a valuable treasure of folk literature.
    West Road Pingju and the Pingju currently popular throughout the country are twin lotus flowers; they are born from the same root, but the flowers are divided into two. They both originated and formed on the basis of the folk art forms of Lianhualuo and B蹦 music. Because West Road Pingju developed in Beijing and the western suburbs of Beijing, it was influenced by ancient opera genres in the western suburbs of Beijing, such as Bangzi, Lao Diao, and Hahaqiang, coupled with the creative labor of West Road Pingju artists, so the singing became high-pitched and passionate, and the rhythmic patterns were abundant. Compared with the current Pingju singing, the vocal range of male and female voices is twice as wide, so it has rich expressiveness.
    West Road Pingju has complete roles of sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted face male), mo (old male), and chou (clown), and each has its own singing style. There have been famous actors such as Jin Yezi, Tiao Lianhong, Wang Dianzuo, Wang Dianliang, Renrenle, Siyuexian, Xiaomifeng, Guo Qirong, and Guo Qifu. Due to the oppression and destruction of the reactionary government, this excellent opera genre was buried for more than thirty years. Currently, there are only three or four West Road Pingju old artists who are already in their sixties. Thanks to the support and care of the Pingju Theater Party, the most outstanding young actors have been selected to inherit and develop the art of West Road Pingju. Under the leadership of the Party, the art of West Road Pingju will be gloriously developed. With these two flowers, Pingju art will enhance its artistic expression and have a better weapon to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and socialist construction.

    西路评剧花重开
    胡沙
    中国评剧院近日在首都挖掘演出了失传已达三十多年的西路评剧“夜宿花亭”，得到了观众的热烈欢迎和赞扬；从此，评剧艺术又多了一支鲜丽的花朵。这是党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲改革政策的又一胜利。
    由于西路评剧是六十多年前在北京发展形成的具有独特地方色彩的剧种，因此她又名叫“北京蹦蹦”。
    “北京蹦蹦”曾以其刚健豪放的民间风格，民间口头诗歌情调的剧目，高亢激越的唱腔和优美的表演艺术感动过北京的劳动人民。
    比方像众所周知的诗剧“杨二舍化缘”，就是西路评剧的主要剧目之一。其它像“卖水记”、“古存打鸟”、“夜宿花亭”、“窦娥冤”等诗意浓郁的剧目约有六十多个。这是一笔宝贵的民间文学财富。
    西路评剧和目前流行全国的评剧是并蒂莲花，她们是同根而生，花分两朵。她们都是在民间艺术形式莲花落和蹦蹦音乐的基础上产生形成的。由于西路评剧在北京及京西一带发展，受到京西一带的古老剧种如梆子、老调和哈哈腔的熏陶，再加上西路评剧艺人的创造性的劳动，所以唱腔变得高亢激昂，板头丰富。男声和女声的唱腔和现行的评剧唱腔音域相比，均宽一倍，因此具有丰富的表现力。
    西路评剧生、旦、净、末、丑行当齐全，并各有各的唱腔。曾出现过像金叶子、挑帘红、王殿佐、王殿良、人人乐、四月仙、小蜜蜂、郭启荣、郭启富等著名的演员。由于反动政府的压迫和摧残，使这一优秀的剧种埋没了三十多年，目前仅剩下三、四个年已花甲的西路评剧老艺人。由于评剧院党的支持和关怀，选择了条件最优秀的青年演员来继承发展西路评剧艺术。西路评剧艺术将在党的领导下得到光辉的发展。评剧艺术有了这两支花朵，就更增强了自己的艺术表现力，多了一种更好的为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务的武器。
