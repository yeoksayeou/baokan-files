    Cowherd Becomes Engineer
   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Women's Day, female workers at the "Blagoev" spinning mill in the suburbs of Sofia are stepping up production to welcome the festival. In the roaring workshop, a comrade dressed as a female worker was enthusiastically explaining something to a female worker next to a spinning machine. The factory director, Dimitar Kuzov, introduced us: "This is the female engineer and member of the Bulgarian National Assembly you want to interview, Ivanka Mircheva... Before liberation, she was a cowherd and a maid..." At this moment, Comrade Mircheva, a sturdy and amiable woman who looked to be in her thirties, shook hands with us very warmly to say hello. In the factory director's office, she very excitedly recounted her past tragic experiences and her current happy life.
      Tragic Past
    Mircheva was born in the village of Novoselo in the Balkan Mountains of northern Bulgaria. Her family was very poor. There were four people in her family: her father, mother, older sister, and herself. They only had four decares (each decare equals 1.5 mu) of thin mountain land. To support his family, her father was forced to leave the village to work as a coal miner. Due to the capitalists' cruel exploitation of the workers and the harsh working conditions, her father contracted lung disease in 1935 and was fired and sent home. At this time, the burden of supporting the family fell on her mother's shoulders. Her mother had to work for landlords and rich peasants to earn some food and clothing and to treat her father's illness. Due to overwork and worry, her mother died less than two years after her father fell ill. Mircheva, just over ten years old, embarked on a difficult life path. To support her bedridden father and seek a livelihood, Mircheva herded cattle for wealthy people, and her fifteen-year-old sister worked as a maid in Sofia. Mircheva suffered all kinds of ridicule and torment from her masters. Mircheva told us about a very infuriating incident: The master had a bull that was naturally irritable. One day, to play with and ridicule this poor girl, the master gave her a rein and said to her, "Mircheva, as long as you tie one end of this rope to the bull's horn and the other end to your ankle, it won't be able to run." The naive ten-year-old Mircheva did not see through the intentions of the wolf-hearted master and did as she was told. As a result, the bull ran wildly, and Mircheva was dragged on the ground alive. Fortunately, the villagers discovered her early, so she was not dragged to death, but her whole body was seriously injured.
    After recovering from her injuries, Mircheva was no longer willing to herd cattle for wealthy families and be bullied. So she followed her sister to Sofia and began her life as a maid. At this time, she was only twelve years old. However, the work she did was the same as that of an adult. Due to being overworked, malnourished, and living in a damp hut, Mircheva developed severe arthritis at the age of fifteen. To make a living, she still endured the pain and insisted on working. Later, the arthritis affected her heart, her hands and feet swelled, and her condition was very dangerous, so she could no longer continue working. At this time, the ruthless master fired her…. Her sister worked hard to cure her sister's illness.
    Mircheva lived such a tragic life for eighteen years before liberation.
    Slaves Become Masters
    Like all poor women in Bulgaria, the sound of artillery fire during the national liberation in 1944 brought a new and happy life to Mircheva. The second year after liberation, Mircheva and her sister were introduced by the Central Council of Trade Unions to work in the "Blagoev" spinning mill near Sofia. At this time, her happiness and joy were indescribable. She loved her work very much, never haggled over prices, and humbly learned. She quickly mastered spinning techniques and overfulfilled her production tasks every month. From three months after entering the factory until nearly three years before going to school, she maintained the glorious title of "Production Shock Worker" and was a model for all the workers in the factory to learn from.
    Another excellent quality of Mircheva is that she is very happy to use her spare time to do things that are beneficial to the collective.
    In the early days of Bulgaria's liberation, there was a shortage of materials and economic difficulties. At that time, the Bulgarian Communist Party called on people from all walks of life across the country to contribute to the rapid restoration and development of the national economy. Mircheva and her partners actively responded to this important call from the Party. In order to produce more materials for the country and ensure the normal operation of the machines, she took some time off every Sunday, leading many partners to the workshop to wipe the machines and oil them. Before each shift, she rushed to the workshop to prepare for production for the entire work shift. During the summer and autumn harvests, she and her partners actively helped the military families in the rural areas near the factory to harvest crops and do farm work.
    Because Mircheva worked actively, had good ideological qualities, and a high level of class consciousness, she was accepted as a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1946. In 1957, she was elected as a member of the National Assembly by the voters of the Levski constituency in Sofia.
    Devote Everything to the Party
    During our visit, Mircheva said excitedly and sincerely: "All my knowledge and working ability are the result of the Party's cultivation. I am determined to dedicate everything to the Party and to the most beautiful cause of mankind—the cause of communism."
    In 1947, as the most outstanding worker in the factory, she was selected by the factory to study at the Sliven Secondary Textile Technical School. After graduating from here, because of her excellent academic performance, she was recommended by the state to study at the Sofia Institute of Technology for one year, and then went to study in the Soviet Union. In 1957, after graduating from the Moscow Textile Institute, she became a cotton spinning process engineer.
    At the end of 1957, Mircheva returned to work at the factory where she had worked—the "Blagoev" spinning mill in Sofia. Now she is the foreman of one of the three work shifts in the factory. She still maintains the excellent qualities of being honest and simple as a worker, working actively and responsibly, and being kind and friendly to comrades. When workers mention her, they affectionately call her "Our Mircheva."
    The work shift led by Mircheva, consisting of 150 workers, has overfulfilled its production tasks year after year for the past two years and has always been the best work shift in the factory in completing its tasks.
    In 1958, after the Party put forward the slogan of completing the Five-Year Plan in three or four years, their entire work shift proposed: We are determined to complete the production tasks stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan in three years and ten months!

    放牛娃当了工程师
   “三八”国际妇女节五十周年前夕，索非亚市郊区“布拉戈耶夫”纺纱厂的女工们加紧生产，迎接佳节。在机器轰响的车间里，一个女工装束的同志正在纺纱机旁热诚地向一个女工解释着什么。厂长季米特尔·库佐夫给我们介绍说：“这就是你们要访问的那位女工程师、保加利亚国民议会议员伊万卡·米尔切娃……她在解放前当过放牛娃，做过女佣人……”。这时，看上去有三十多岁的健壮而和蔼的米尔切娃同志极为热情地跟我们握手问好。在厂长办公室里，她非常激动地讲述了她的过去的悲惨遭遇和现在的幸福生活。
      悲惨的过去
    米尔切娃出生在保加利亚北部巴尔干山中的诺沃谢洛村。她的家境十分贫寒，一家四口人：父亲、母亲、姐姐和她，仅有四狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一亩半）薄山地。为了养活家小，父亲被迫离开村子到煤矿上当矿工。由于资本家对工人的残酷剥削，工作条件恶劣，1935年她的父亲患了肺病，被解雇回家。这时，全家生活的重担就落在她母亲的身上了。母亲只得给地主富农家作活，挣点吃穿，给父亲治病。由于劳累和愁闷，父亲病倒后不到两年，母亲就死了。米尔切娃十岁多一点就开始走上了艰难的生活道路。为了扶养卧病在床的父亲谋求生路，米尔切娃给富人放牛，她的十五岁的姐姐到索非亚市给人当佣人。米尔切娃受尽了主人的愚弄和折磨。米尔切娃对我们讲述了这样一个十分令人激愤的事：主人有一头生性暴躁的牛。有一天，主人为了玩弄和取笑这个穷女孩子，就给她一根缰绳，对她说：“米尔切娃，只要把这根绳的一头拴在那头牛的角上，另一头拴在你的脚脖子上，它就跑不动了。”不懂事的十岁多的米尔切娃，没有识破狼心狗肺的主人的用意，就照主人说的作了。结果，这头牛撒野地跑了起来，米尔切娃被活活地拖在地上。幸亏被村人发现得早，才没被拖死，但是全身都受了重伤。
    伤养好后，米尔切娃再也不愿给富人家放牛受气了。于是她就跟随姐姐到索非亚市开始了女佣人的生活。这时，她才满十二岁。但是，她作的活却与成年人一样。由于工作过于疲累，营养差，住在潮湿的小屋里，米尔切娃十五岁那年得了严重的关节炎病。为了糊口，她仍忍受着痛苦，坚持作工。后来，关节炎病影响到了心脏，手脚青肿，病情十分危险，不能继续作工了。这时，狠心的主人解雇了她……。她的姐姐千辛万苦地为妹妹治好了病。
    解放前的十八年中，米尔切娃就是过着这样悲惨的生活。
    奴隶成了主人
    像保加利亚所有的穷苦妇女一样，1944年全国解放的炮声给米尔切娃带来了崭新的幸福生活。解放后的第二年，米尔切娃就和她的姐姐一起由工会中央理事会介绍到索非亚市附近的“布拉戈耶夫”纺纱厂作工。这时，她的幸福和愉快的心情是无法形容的。她非常热爱她的工作，从来不讲价钱，虚心学习，很快就掌握了纺纱技术，月月超额完成生产任务。从入厂三个月以后，直到去学校学习以前的近三年中，她一直保持着“生产突击手”的光荣称号，是全厂工人学习的榜样。
    米尔切娃的另一个优良品质是非常乐于利用工余休息时间作一些有益于集体的事情。
    保加利亚解放初期，物资缺乏，经济困难。当时，保加利亚共产党号召全国各阶层人民为迅速恢复和发展国民经济作出贡献。米尔切娃和她的伙伴们积极地响应了党的这一重要的号召。为了给国家生产更多的物资，保证机器的正常运转，每逢星期日她都抽出一部分休息时间，带动许多伙伴去车间擦机器，给机器上油。每次上班前，她都抢先到车间去为全工作班作生产前的准备工作。夏收和秋收时，她又跟伙伴们一起，积极帮助工厂附近农村的军人家属收割庄稼，作农活。
    由于米尔切娃工作积极，思想品质好，阶级觉悟高，1946年她被接受为保加利亚共产党党员。1957年她被索非亚市列夫斯基选区的选民们选为国民议会议员。
    把一切献给党
    我们访问时，米尔切娃激动而诚挚地说：“我的一切知识和工作能力都是党培养的结果。我决心把一切献给党，献给人类最美好的事业——共产主义事业。”
    1947年她作为全厂最优秀的工人被工厂选送到斯里文市中等纺织技术学校学习深造。在这里毕业后，因为学习成绩优秀，被国家保送到索非亚市工学院学习一年后，就到苏联留学去了。1957年她在莫斯科纺织学院毕业后，成为棉纺工艺工程师。
    1957年末米尔切娃又重新回到了她工作过的工厂——索非亚市“布拉戈耶夫”纺纱厂工作。现在是全厂三个工作班中的一个班的工长。她仍然保持着作工人时的忠厚朴实，工作积极负责、对同志和蔼可亲等优良品质。工人们提起她时，都亲切地称她为“我们的米尔切娃”。
    米尔切娃领导的由一百五十个工人组成的一个工作班，两年来年年超额完成生产任务，一直都是全厂完成任务最好的一个工作班。
    1958年，党提出了三、四年完成五年计划的口号后，她们全工作班提出：决心在三年零十个月内完成第三个五年计划规定的生产任务！
