Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, March 3rd: The "Russia" and "Yakutsk" ships dispatched by the Chinese government to Indonesia to transport returning overseas Chinese compatriots arrived in Zhanjiang Port this morning, carrying more than 1,600 overseas Chinese who were persecuted and displaced in Indonesia. They were warmly welcomed and cordially received by more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City.

Today, this modern seaport in South China presented a joyous scene of welcoming relatives. The port area was newly decorated. Colorful flags fluttered in the wind on the roofs of a row of tall buildings and on the huge gantry cranes. Eye-catching huge welcome banners read: "The great motherland is the most powerful backing for overseas Chinese" and "Welcome overseas Chinese compatriots back to the embrace of the motherland." People from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City, dressed in festive costumes and holding colorful flags, gathered at the dock early in the morning to wait for their relatives returning from overseas.

"Motherland! My dear mother! We have finally returned to your embrace!"

As the ship slowly approached the shore at nearly nine o'clock, the dock suddenly resounded with gongs and drums, and firecrackers were set off. Lion dances began. Members of the cultural troupe from the Overseas Chinese Supplementary School, who had come specially from Guangzhou to welcome them, sang and danced to the music. The welcoming crowd applauded warmly, waving colorful flags and waving to the overseas Chinese on the ship. Seeing such a grand and enthusiastic welcome from the people of the motherland, and about to set foot on the soil of the motherland, the overseas Chinese compatriots cheered and jumped with excitement, waving and cheering to the crowd on the dock. Many people had tears in their eyes. A joyous atmosphere of family reunion filled the entire dock.

When the ship docked, the returning overseas Chinese raised banners with slogans such as "Motherland! My dear mother! We have finally returned to your embrace!" and "Participating in the socialist construction of the motherland is our common aspiration" as they disembarked. At this time, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Fang Fang, member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese and Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, who were standing at the forefront of the welcoming crowd, first walked to the front of the ship and shook hands with the overseas Chinese compatriots, extending a warm welcome and cordial greetings to them. The reception staff, customs officers, and medical personnel on the ship and on the dock enthusiastically helped the elderly and infirm overseas Chinese compatriots, helping them carry children and luggage. Wang Fengxi, the first returning overseas Chinese woman to disembark, suffered from lower limb paralysis in Indonesia and could not move. Medical personnel put her on a stretcher and immediately sent her to the medical station. The returning overseas Chinese, Luo Helin, was already seventy-two years old and had worked as a craftsman in Cimara, Indonesia, for more than fifty years. In early December last year, during the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia, he was knocked down and injured by six fully armed military police. Although more than two months had passed, his injuries had not yet healed. As soon as he disembarked, nurses and reception staff immediately stepped forward to help him and carry his luggage. The old man was so moved that he burst into tears and repeatedly said to the people, "Thank you for the care and concern of my relatives in the motherland." The elderly returning overseas Chinese, Qiu Qinyuan, was seventy-three years old, and his entire family of seven had returned. He suffered from athlete's foot and could not walk on his own. Two reception staff helped him from the ship to the dock and transported him to the welcome rally venue by car. He said excitedly: "The motherland is so good to us overseas Chinese! So good!"

Also present at the dock today to welcome the overseas Chinese compatriots were: Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; You Yangzu, Wang Yuanxing, Wu Yixiu, and Li Mei, members of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese; Cai Zhongchang, Standing Committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Tian Xin, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province; Yi Meihou, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Lu Shaowu, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Nong Kang, Director of the General Office of the People's Committee of the Autonomous Region; Li Long, Deputy Director of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the Autonomous Region; Pan Qingqi, Vice Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation of the Autonomous Region; Guo Ruiren, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Fujian Province; Mo Huai, Secretary of the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Commissioner, and Director of the Zhanjiang Special District Office for Reception and Placement of Returned Overseas Chinese; Jia Kui, Secretary of the Zhanjiang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Chen Zhiqun, Deputy Mayor of Zhanjiang City, and other responsible persons of Party and government organizations and overseas Chinese groups.

Overcoming all obstacles to return to the motherland is a manifestation of loving the motherland.

At half past eleven, the welcome rally for returned overseas Chinese began. Jia Kui, Secretary of the Zhanjiang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, first delivered a welcome speech, expressing a warm welcome on behalf of the people of the city to the overseas Chinese compatriots who had victoriously returned to the motherland.

Then Fang Fang spoke at the rally. On behalf of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, he extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the overseas Chinese compatriots who had returned safely to the embrace of the motherland. At the same time, he expressed his heartfelt thanks and high respect to all the Soviet crew members who transported the overseas Chinese compatriots back to their country.

Fang Fang said that the overseas Chinese in Indonesia have worked diligently for generations and have made indelible contributions to the economic and cultural development of the local area. However, a segment of powerful groups in Indonesia who are hostile to the friendship between the two peoples, listened to the instigation of imperialism and carried out large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities. The people of our motherland and the overseas Chinese living all over the world have expressed great indignation at this.

Fang Fang said: "We hope that the current anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese countercurrent in Indonesia is only a temporary phenomenon, because anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities only benefit imperialism, and are not conducive to the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist cause of the peoples of Asian countries, and are not conducive to the Indonesian people." He pointed out that the people of China and Indonesia have a deep friendship. During the forced relocation of overseas Chinese, the broad masses of Indonesian people expressed sympathy for them.

Fang Fang said that the returning overseas Chinese compatriots have suffered a lot of persecution and hardship in Indonesia, and overcoming all obstacles to return to the motherland is a manifestation of loving the motherland. He said that in the history of China, no government has ever cared for overseas Chinese like the current one, and sending ships abroad to pick up overseas Chinese compatriots is a groundbreaking initiative. He hoped that after returning to the motherland, the overseas Chinese would continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, carry forward the tradition of loving labor, work hard in production, manage their families diligently and thriftily, and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. He said that in order to take care of the situation that this group of overseas Chinese compatriots have lived together for a long time and jointly opposed persecution and jointly returned to the motherland, this group of overseas Chinese compatriots will all be settled in Guangxi for employment, work, and study.

Lu Shaowu welcomed the overseas Chinese compatriots to Guangxi to participate in socialist construction.

Lu Shaowu also spoke at the welcome rally. On behalf of the People's Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the 20 million people of all ethnic groups in the region, he extended condolences and welcome to the overseas Chinese compatriots who had returned to the motherland after experiencing many hardships, and welcomed the overseas Chinese compatriots to Guangxi to participate in socialist construction. Lu Shaowu said that in the past ten years, Guangxi has received more than 10,000 returned overseas Chinese compatriots. The Party and the government, according to the needs of the country and the aspirations and talents of the overseas Chinese, have arranged for them to work in factories, enterprises, and farms, or to study in schools. Many people have become labor models or advanced workers. In order to welcome more overseas Chinese to Guangxi, overseas Chinese farms have recently been planned and built in seven counties including Wuming, and an overseas Chinese secondary supplementary school is also being planned and built in Nanning. He said that Guangxi is a rich and beautiful place in southern China, suitable for growing subtropical economic crops, with many mineral deposits and abundant underground resources. When the overseas Chinese compatriots go there, they will surely be able to quickly take up work or study positions, give full play to their strengths, and serve the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

Deng Kunhe, an overseas Chinese born in West Java, spoke at the rally on behalf of this group of returning overseas Chinese compatriots. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the motherland's deep concern for overseas Chinese, and expressed his indignation at the persecution of overseas Chinese by powerful groups in Indonesia.

After the welcome rally, the overseas Chinese compatriots boarded彩车 (decorated floats) to rest in Chikan District. At this time, the crowds who lined the streets to welcome them beat gongs and drums and applauded warmly. The returning overseas Chinese also stretched out their hands from the car windows to wave frequently to the welcoming crowds. As the car slowly drove into Chikan District, the atmosphere of warm welcome was everywhere. The main street in the city, Zhongshan Road, was erected with three tall牌楼 (decorated archways) with welcome slogans written on them. Many organs, schools, shops, and high-rise buildings also hung welcome banners and posted colorful welcome slogans at their doors.

When the returning overseas Chinese compatriots arrived at the rest room, the reception staff immediately brought hot tea, and doctors and nurses were busy treating the sick overseas Chinese compatriots. The places where the overseas Chinese compatriots stayed today were all cleaned spotlessly, and many quilts and pillow towels were also new. After a short rest, the returning overseas Chinese began to eat the first fragrant lunch prepared for them by their relatives in the motherland.

    国门悬灯彩　迎接亲人归
    接运归国的又一批印度尼西亚华侨到湛江
    廖承志、方方等前往欢迎并致亲切的慰问
    新华社湛江3日电　我国政府派往印度尼西亚接运归国侨胞的轮船“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”，今天上午载着一千六百多名在印度尼西亚遭受迫害因而流离失所的华侨到达湛江港，受到湛江市各界人民三千多人的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。
    今天，这个华南现代化海港，呈现了一片迎接亲人的欢乐景象。港区装饰一新，在一排高大的建筑物的屋顶上，和庞大的龙门式起重机上，彩旗迎风招展，醒目的巨幅欢迎标语写着：“伟大祖国是华侨最有力的靠山”、“欢迎海外侨胞们回到祖国怀抱”。身穿节日盛装、手持彩旗的湛江市各界人民，一清早便汇集到码头上等候着海外归来的亲人。
   “祖国！我的亲娘！我们终于回到了你的怀抱！”
    近九时，当轮船缓缓靠岸的时候，码头上顿时锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，群狮起舞。特地从广州赶来欢迎的华侨补习学校文工团团员们，伴着乐曲载歌载舞。欢迎的人群热烈地鼓掌，挥舞着彩旗，向船上的侨胞们招手致意。看到祖国人民这样隆重热情的欢迎，自己就要踏上祖国土地，侨胞们都兴奋地欢呼、跳跃，向码头上的人群招手欢呼，不少人热泪盈眶。亲人团聚的欢乐气氛洋溢着整个码头。
    当轮船靠岸后，归侨们高举着“祖国！我的亲娘！我们终于回到了你的怀抱！”和“参加祖国社会主义建设是我们的共同愿望”等横额上岸。这时，站在欢迎群众最前列的中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员、华侨事务委员会主任廖承志，接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员、华侨事务委员会副主任方方，首先走向轮船前面和侨胞们握手，向他们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。轮船上和码头上的接待人员、海关人员和医务人员，热情地搀扶年老体弱的侨胞，帮助侨胞们抱孩子和拿行李。第一个下船的归侨妇女王凤兮，在印度尼西亚得了下肢瘫痪症，不能行动，医务人员用担架把她抬上汽车，立即送到医疗站。归侨罗和粦，已经七十二岁了，在印度尼西亚芝马拉野作了五十多年手艺工人。去年12月初在印度尼西亚排华活动中，被六个全副武装的军警摔倒和打伤，虽然已时隔两个多月了，但他受的伤，直到现在还没有好。他一下船，护士和接待人员立即上前搀扶他，为他拿行李。老人激动得热泪盈眶，一再地向人们说：“谢谢祖国亲人对我的关怀和照顾。”七十三岁的老年归侨丘钦元，全家七口人都回来了。他患脚气病自己不能走动，两个接待人员从船上扶他上码头，并用汽车送他到欢迎大会会场。他激动地说：“祖国对我们华侨太好了！太好了！”
    今天到码头上迎接侨胞们的还有：华侨事务委员会副主任庄希泉、黄长水、庄明理，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长连贯，接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员尤扬祖、王源兴、吴益修、李梅，全国归国华侨联合会常务委员蔡仲长，广东省华侨事务委员会主任田心，广东省归国华侨联合会主席蚁美厚，广西僮族自治区副主席卢绍武，自治区人民委员会办公厅主任农康，自治区接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员李隆，自治区侨联副主席潘清启，福建省华侨事务委员会副主任郭瑞人，中共湛江地委书记兼专员、湛江专区接待和安置归国华侨办公室主任莫怀，中共湛江市委书记贾奎，湛江市副市长陈志群等党政和归侨团体负责人。
    战胜一切阻挠回到祖国，这是热爱祖国的表现。
    十一时半，欢迎归侨大会开始。中共湛江市委书记贾奎首先致欢迎词，代表全市人民对胜利回到祖国的侨胞表示热烈的欢迎。
    接着方方在大会上讲了话。他代表中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会，对平安地回到祖国怀抱的侨胞们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。同时对接运侨胞回国的全体苏联船员，表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    方方说，在印度尼西亚的华侨，世代辛勤劳动，给当地的经济和文化发展作了不可抹煞的贡献。但是印度尼西亚一部分敌视两国人民友好的有势力集团，听从帝国主义的挑拨，大规模地进行反华排华活动。对此，我们祖国人民和旅居世界各地的华侨都表示极大的愤慨。
    方方说：“我们希望，目前印度尼西亚的反华排华逆流，只是暂时的现象，因为反华排华只有利于帝国主义，而不利于亚洲各国人民反帝国主义反殖民主义的事业，不利于印度尼西亚人民。”他指出，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民是有着深厚友谊的，这次在华侨被逼迁的过程中，广大的印度尼西亚人民就对他们表示同情。
    方方说，回来的侨胞们在印度尼西亚受到很多迫害和苦难，战胜一切阻挠回到祖国，这是热爱祖国的表现。他说，在中国的历史上，从来没有过那一个政府像现在这样关怀华侨，派船出国接运侨胞回国就是一个创举。他希望华侨回到祖国后，继续发扬爱国主义精神，发扬热爱劳动的传统，努力生产，勤俭持家，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设。他说，为了照顾这批侨胞长期生活在一起和这次共同反对迫害、共同返回祖国的情况，这批侨胞将全部安置在广西就业、工作和学习。
      卢绍武欢迎侨胞们到广西参加社会主义建设。
    卢绍武也在欢迎大会上讲了话。他代表广西僮族自治区人民委员会和全区两千万各族人民向经历千辛万苦回到祖国的侨胞们致以慰问和欢迎，欢迎侨胞们到广西参加社会主义建设。卢绍武说，十年来，广西共接待了一万多名归国侨胞，党和政府根据国家的需要，以及侨胞的志愿和才能，分别安置他们到工厂、企业和农场工作，或到学校学习，许多人已经成为劳动模范或先进工作者。为了欢迎更多的侨胞到广西去，近来已在武鸣等七个县筹建华侨农场，还在南宁筹建华侨中等补习学校。他说，广西是祖国南方的一个富饶美丽的地方，适于种植亚热带经济作物，矿藏很多，地下资源丰富。侨胞们去到那里，一定能够很快走上工作或学习岗位，可以发挥所长，为祖国社会主义建设事业服务。
    来自西爪哇的在侨居地出生的华侨邓昆和，代表这批归国侨胞在大会上讲话。他对祖国深切关怀华侨，表示衷心感激，对印度尼西亚有势力集团迫害华侨的行为表示愤慨。
    欢迎大会结束后，侨胞们坐上彩车到赤坎区休息。这时，夹道欢迎的群众敲锣打鼓、热烈鼓掌，归侨们也从车窗里伸出手来向欢迎的群众频频挥手致意。当汽车缓缓地驶入赤坎区时，到处都是热烈欢迎的气氛，市内的主要街道——中山路，搭起了三个高大的写着欢迎标语的牌楼；许多机关、学校、商店和高层建筑物的门口，也挂上欢迎的横额，贴上五颜六色的欢迎标语。
    归侨们到达休息室时，接待人员随即送来了热茶，医生、护士也忙着为患病的侨胞看病。归侨们今天住的地方，都打扫得干干净净，许多被褥和枕巾也都是新的。归侨们稍事休息后，便开始吃上祖国亲人为他们准备好的第一餐香喷喷的午饭。
