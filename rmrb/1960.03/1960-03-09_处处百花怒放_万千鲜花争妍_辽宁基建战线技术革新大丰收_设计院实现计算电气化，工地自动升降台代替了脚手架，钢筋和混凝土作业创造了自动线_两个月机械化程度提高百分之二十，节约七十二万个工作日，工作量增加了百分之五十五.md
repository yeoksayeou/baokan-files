   Liaoning's Capital Construction Front Achieves a Bumper Harvest in Technical Innovation
   Design Institutes Achieve Computerized Electrification, Automatic Lifting Platforms Replace Scaffolding on Construction Sites, Automatic Lines Created for Steel and Concrete Operations
   Mechanization Increased by 20 Percent in Two Months, Saving 720,000 Workdays, Workload Increased by 55 Percent

   Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 8th.  A massive mass movement to advance towards mechanization, electrification, automation, and prefabrication has been launched on the basic construction front in Liaoning Province. In the initial stage of the movement, the focus was on realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and a large-scale bumper harvest was quickly achieved. In the past two months, the construction and installation departments have created and imitated nearly ten thousand construction machines. Many of these machines have increased efficiency by multiples and hundreds of times, saving more than 720,000 workdays to date. The level of mechanization in basic construction throughout the province has increased by about 20% on the basis of last year, and the amount of work completed is 55% more than in the same period last year. Judging from the current situation, units with a better development of the movement can certainly achieve the goal of "increasing production without increasing manpower, one person doing the work of several people" this year.

   According to the situation that the construction tasks this year have increased by 30%, and the manpower is insufficient, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires the basic construction department to quickly innovate technology, and to achieve large-scale flowering and large-scale harvest, in order to achieve continuous leap forward. After this call was issued, the vast number of workers in geological exploration, design, and construction and installation departments throughout the province were involved in the wave of advancing towards "the four modernizations." They first aimed at the most cumbersome and labor-intensive types of work, and proposed specific innovation directions, goals, and measures. In just fifty days, they put forward more than 370,000 suggestions, almost equal to the total for the entire year last year. Because all localities have adopted the method of everyone making suggestions, everyone appraising, everyone selecting types, and everyone finalizing, more than 250,000 pieces have been realized so far, so that every type of work and every process has been innovated or advanced experience has been promoted. The masses describe this innovation movement as "all plants blooming together, flowers blooming everywhere." More than a dozen design institutes, where calculations are complicated and drawing and drafting consume a lot of manpower, have summed up their previous experience and realized computerized electrification in a very short period of time. Universal drawings and prefabricated drawings have replaced manual drawing and drafting. In the past, it took two weeks to calculate a three-story, five-span frame, but now one person can calculate it in just a few minutes by pressing the button of a computer. The workload completed by these design institutes in two months has exceeded the total for the first half of last year or the entire year, changing the situation in which design has long lagged behind construction. The characteristic of construction sites is high mobility and a lot of heavy labor. The steel, carpentry, cement, transportation, and other ten major types of work in the construction department have created lightweight, simple, easy-to-disassemble, and easy-to-assemble construction machinery in response to this characteristic. In the past, construction projects were covered with dense layers of scaffolding, which was both labor-intensive and energy-consuming. Automatic lifting platforms created in Lushun and other places have replaced scaffolding. This automatic lifting platform is very light and easy to assemble and disassemble. On construction sites, vertical and horizontal short-distance transportation is large in quantity and heavy. Now, small-scale mechanical transportation operation lines have appeared on major construction sites, generally saving half of the manpower and increasing efficiency by more than double.

   Under the guidance of the idea of continuous revolution, the construction departments in various places have been improving technology from modifying existing equipment to invention and creation, from semi-mechanization to mechanization and automation, thereby gradually improving work efficiency. The production relations on construction sites are also becoming more and more coordinated and closer. The steel bar processing of the No. 2 Construction Company of Lushun originally had more than a dozen single machines. On this basis, the employees modified one piece, matched one piece, and used one piece, so that each piece was as consistent as possible with the requirements of being connected into an automatic line. Finally, an automatic steel bar processing line was formed, which doubled the efficiency. In the past, concrete processing and pouring on construction sites required the most manpower, but there was very little mechanical equipment. Each production link was connected by shoulder-carrying and hand-pushing transportation methods, which was inefficient and often caused chaos on the construction site and uncoordinated production. The Shenyang construction department and scientific research departments cooperated and adopted a three-way combination approach, using very little money to create an automatic concrete operation line. From sand and gravel transportation to screening, loading, metering, mixing, and pouring, only a few workers control the electrical switches in the distance, and a set of machines automatically and continuously produces. In this way, the construction site is no longer chaotic, the various production links are organically linked, and the relationship between people in production is very coordinated and close. At present, the province is promoting the use of this automatic operation line in large quantities. The original seventy-one cement workers at the Shenyang Auditorium construction site only needed nine people after the automatic line was installed. The construction efficiency was increased by five times, and the project quality was all first-class. Therefore, the workers excitedly wrote poems to praise: "Cement workers smile, sand and gravel are automatically delivered, the big iron shovel is thrown away for mixing, and the workers get on the console." In addition, the province also created 739 automated single machines on the basis of general construction machinery, saving manpower and improving work efficiency.

   The important measures for the rapid, extensive, and in-depth development and large-scale harvest of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in Liaoning's basic construction department are to vigorously grasp the new technological trends, and adopt various methods such as selecting the essence, large-scale publicity, large-scale exhibitions, organizing visits, and holding on-site meetings to quickly promote and improve them. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a mobile on-site meeting, bringing together more than 370 cadres, innovation experts, and technical personnel from the basic construction front across the province to visit the new creations of the broad masses in Andong, Fushun, Lushun, and Shenyang, and implemented the method of watching, listening, performing, researching, and evaluating and comparing, selecting hundreds of new machines with simple structure, strong and practical. In the selection process, after joint research by various localities and departments, learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, selecting the best from the good, and finally finalizing the design, gradually moving from points to lines, from lines to surfaces, relatively perfecting and matching, creating conditions for various departments to promote independently, greatly reducing the amount of repeated research and trial production, and quickly presenting a situation of one flower blooming luxuriantly and hundreds of flowers competing for beauty. The Fushun Construction Bureau organized sixty "treasure hunting and experience teams" to take more than 2,000 "treasures" from Andong and other cities, and paired them into 126 "dragons" in a dozen days, so that the main types of work such as steel bar, carpentry, electrical work, cement work, and hoisting work basically realized mechanization, semi-mechanization, or automation, which was several times faster and better than the original planned self-innovation progress. The number of automatic lines and linkage lines in the construction department of the province was only a few dozen in January, but now it has reached more than 550. Due to the large-scale promotion of new technology and equipment, labor productivity is increasing every ten days and every month. Manpower savings were more than 250,000 workdays in January and reached more than 470,000 workdays in February.

   In order to make innovation suggestions immediately effective, the province's major construction companies and construction sites have established small and medium-sized machinery repair and manufacturing networks to be responsible for technical processing. Many suggestions can generally be self-reliantly manufactured into machines and used on construction sites within a few days after being adopted, selected, and finalized.

    处处百花怒放  万千鲜花争妍
    辽宁基建战线技术革新大丰收
    设计院实现计算电气化，工地自动升降台代替了脚手架，钢筋和混凝土作业创造了自动线
    两个月机械化程度提高百分之二十，节约七十二万个工作日，工作量增加了百分之五十五
   本报沈阳8日电　辽宁省基本建设战线开展了声势浩大的向机械化、电气化、自动化、工厂化进军的群众运动，运动的初期，以实现手工操作机械化半机械化为重点，迅速获得了大面积丰收。在过去的两个月中，建筑安装部门创造和仿制了近万台施工机械，许多机械都成倍成百倍地提高了效率，到现在已节约了七十二万多个工日。全省基本建设机械化程度在去年的基础上提高了20％左右，完成的工作量比去年同期多55％。从当前情况来看，运动开展较好的单位，“增产不增人，一人顶数人”的目标，今年肯定可以实现。
    中共辽宁省委根据今年建设任务增长幅度达30％，人力不敷需要的情况，要求基本建设部门迅速革新技术，并作到大面积开花，大面积丰收，以实现持续跃进。这个号召发出以后，全省范围内地质勘探、设计和建筑安装部门的广大职工，便卷入了向“四化”进军的浪潮。他们首先针对着本身最笨重、用人最多的工种，提出了具体的革新方向、目标和措施，仅五十天的时间，便提出了三十七万多件建议，几乎等于去年全年的总和。各地由于采取了大家建议、大家鉴定、大家选型、大家定型的办法，到目前已实现了二十五万多件，作到了每个工种、每个工序都有了革新或推广了先进经验。群众形容这次革新运动是“万卉齐放，遍地花开”。计算繁琐，描图、制图费去大量人工的十多个设计院，总结了以往的经验，在很短时间内就实现了计算电气化，万能图和装配式图代替了手工描图、制图。过去计算一个三层五跨框架要两个星期，现在一人按动计算机的电钮，只要几分钟就算了出来。这些设计院两个月完成的工作量，已分别超过了去年上半年或全年的总和，改变了长期以来设计落后于施工的局面。建筑工地的特点是流动性大，笨重劳动多。施工部门的钢筋、木工、水泥、运输等十个主要工种，都针对这个特点，创制了轻巧、简便、易拆、易装的施工机械。在过去，建筑工程上都搭着密密层层的脚手架，既费工又费力；旅大等地创造的自动升降台代替了脚手架，这种自动升降台十分轻便，又容易装拆。在工地上，垂直和水平两种短途运输，数量大，又笨重，现在各主要工地都出现了小型机械运输作业线，人力一般都节省一半，效率提高一倍以上。
    各地建设部门在不断革命的思想指导下，革新技术都是由改制原有设备，到发明创造，由半机械化到机械化、自动化，从而逐步提高工作效率，工地上的生产关系也越来越协调、越来越密切。旅大第二建筑公司的钢筋加工，原来有十多台单机，职工们在这个基础上改一件、配一件、用一件，使每一件都尽量符合连成自动线的要求，最后组成了钢筋作业自动加工线，成倍地提高了效率。过去，工地上混凝土加工、浇灌用人最多，但机械设备很少，各个生产环节大都是用肩担、手推的运输方式联接起来，效率不高，而且往往造成工地混乱，生产不协调。沈阳建筑部门和科学研究部门合作，采取三结合的形式，只用了很少的钱，就创造了混凝土自动作业线，从砂石运输到筛选、上料、计量、搅拌、浇灌等一系列工序，只有几个工人在远方控制电气开关，一套机器便自动连续生产。这样，工地上不乱了，各个生产环节有机地联系了起来，人们在生产中的关系非常协调、密切，目前全省正在大量推广使用这种自动作业线。沈阳大会堂工地水泥工原有七十一人，安装自动线以后只用九人就行了，施工效率提高了五倍，工程质量全是一级品。因此，工人们兴奋地写诗歌颂道：“水泥工人笑颜开，砂石不担自动来，搅拌扔掉大铁锹，力工登上操纵台”。此外，全省还在一般施工机械的基础上，创制了七百三十九台自动化单机，节省了人力，提高了工效。
    辽宁基本建设部门技术革新和技术革命运动能够这样迅速地广泛深入地发展，和取得大面积丰收的重要措施，是狠抓新技术苗头，采取选拔精华、大宣传、大展览、组织参观、开现场会议等各种办法，迅速推广和提高。中共辽宁省委最近召开了流动现场会议，集中全省基本建设战线上的干部、革新能手和技术人员三百七十多人，先后到安东、抚顺、旅大、沈阳参观了广大群众的新创造，实行边看、边听、边表演、边研究、大评大比的办法，选拔了数百种结构简单、坚牢实用的新机具；在选拔中，经过各地、各部门共同研究，取长补短、良中取优，最后定型，逐步作到了从点到线，从线到面，相对完善，配套成龙，为各部门自行推广创造了条件，大大减少了重复研究试制的工作量，很快就出现了一朵鲜花怒放，处处百花争艳的局面。抚顺建筑局组织了六十个“探宝取经队”，去安东等市取来了两千多件“宝”，十几天就配成了一百二十六条“龙”，使钢筋、木工、电气工、水泥工、起重工等主要工种，基本上实现了机械化、半机械化或自动化，比原计划自己革新进度快好几倍。全省建设部门的自动线和联动线1月份只有几十条，现在已达到五百五十条以上。由于新技术装备在大面积上推广，劳动生产率正逐旬逐月提高，人工节省1月份为二十五万多工日，2月份达到四十七万多工日。
    为了使革新建议立见成效，全省主要建筑公司和工地，都已分别建立了中小型机械修造网，负责技术加工，许多建议经过采纳、选型、定型以后，一般都能在几天之内，自力更生地造出机具来，用在工地上。
