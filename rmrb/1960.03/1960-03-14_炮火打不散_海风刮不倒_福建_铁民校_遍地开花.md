    Indestructible by Artillery Fire, Unfazed by Sea Winds:
    Fujian's "Iron People's Schools" Bloom Everywhere
    (Reported by this newspaper) The "Iron People's Schools," praised by the masses as evergreen for their long-term commitment to learning, have blossomed throughout the rural areas of Fujian Province.
    To date, a total of 6,162 Iron People's Schools have emerged, from the frontline coastal islands and fishing villages to the vast mountainous and forested areas and basic construction sites, averaging more than ten per commune. Driven by the Iron People's Schools, the province's efforts to eradicate illiteracy and promote spare-time education have been effectively consolidated and improved. Currently, 3.12 million young and middle-aged people in the province's rural areas are enrolled and consistently engaged in learning, of which 2.57 million are participating in spare-time primary and junior high school studies.
    The Iron People's School movement in Fujian Province has been launched on the basis of continuous great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and constant innovation in production technology in various people's communes. The vast number of young and middle-aged people in rural areas are eager to further improve their cultural, scientific, and technological levels in order to adapt to the rapid development of production and the implementation of technological revolution. Some masses even posted big-character posters criticizing those people's schools that could not provide year-round teaching, while praising the spare-time schools that could, calling them "Iron People's Schools." Party committees and education departments at all levels, based on the demands of the broad masses, have paid special attention to the leadership of literacy and spare-time education, establishing cultural revolution or technical revolution committees at all levels from the province to the commune, deeply summarizing the experiences of various "Iron People's Schools" in maintaining long-term teaching and continuous improvement, and deeply mobilizing the masses to launch a mass movement to create Iron People's Schools. From the province to the city, county, commune, and production brigade, one to several Iron People's Schools were established at each level, serving as models and strongholds for promoting rural spare-time education, enabling the Iron People's Schools to bloom universally throughout the province.
    The common characteristics of the Iron People's Schools are: 1. The secretaries of Party committees at all levels personally take charge, establishing unified organizations that lead both production and learning, uniformly arranging production and teaching time, and arranging spare-time education as a major task, conducting regular inspections and evaluations, so the enthusiasm of teachers and students in these Iron People's Schools is very high and their energy is full. 2. The vast number of grassroots cadres, while leading spare-time education well, can take the lead in adhering to learning and play the backbone and leading role of activists. According to statistics, all people's schools in the province now have about 200,000 such activists. 3. These Iron People's Schools all pay attention to cultivating and improving teachers, improving teaching methods, and improving teaching quality, so that the Iron People's Schools can improve step by step, so that the majority of students can learn something, learn to apply it, and can consistently participate in learning for a long time. 4. In teaching, the Iron People's Schools in various places can resolutely implement the teaching policy of combining production and serving production, achieving the integration of politics, culture, and technology. The teaching organization forms and time can adapt to production and be flexibly arranged, so learning can be regular and lasting. At the same time, the people's schools can become not only a place for the vast number of masses and cadres to learn culture and technology, but also a mass organization for conducting political and ideological education. For example, the 390 teachers and students of the Iron People's School on the Weitou Peninsula in Jinjiang County, a frontline coastal defense area, under the strong leadership of the local Party committee, have flexibly arranged study time based on the characteristics of the frontline's struggle against the enemy and production, and have insisted on year-round teaching in the seven years since the school was founded in 1953. When there is no shelling, they produce during the day and study culture at night. During artillery battles, while doing a good job in supporting the front, they seize the gaps to study in air-raid shelters, achieving centralized learning in peacetime and mobile and decentralized learning during tense production and support for the front. In learning, they also adopted the "four combinations" of politics, military affairs, culture, and technology, with Party committee members teaching politics, officers and soldiers teaching military affairs, and veteran farmers and technicians teaching agricultural science and technology. They also established experimental fields and combined learning with experiments and field practice. At the same time, they turned the people's school into an organization for carrying out the struggle against the enemy, with students combining cultural learning, writing slogans, tying kites, and printing propaganda materials to launch a political offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen. Therefore, they have not only continuously improved the political, military, cultural, and technical levels of the students, but also promoted support for the front and production and construction, and cultivated technical talents in all fields. Praised by the broad masses as the "Iron People's School" of frontline heroes that is "indestructible by artillery fire and unfazed by sea winds," it has become a model for people's schools throughout the province.
  After achieving the widespread establishment of Iron People's Schools in rural Fujian Province, rich experiences have been created for carrying out regular spare-time education in the vast rural areas, and good examples have been set. Party committees and education departments at all levels regard these Iron People's Schools as experimental fields and models for leading the rural cultural and technological revolution, summarizing a set of experiences for adhering to learning year after year and continuously improving, according to different regions and different seasons, and adapting to local conditions. They promote their advanced experiences through holding on-site meetings, observation meetings, and mass evaluation and appraisal meetings, driving the general people's schools to make common leaps forward, thereby promoting the continuous consolidation and improvement of spare-time education in rural areas throughout the province. After summarizing and promoting the diverse learning experiences created by the Iron People's Schools of Weitou Peninsula in Jinjiang County and Yingdu Commune in Nan'an County, Jinjiang Prefecture, the people's schools in various places generally adopted the methods of "four followings" which means that people's schools follow students, teachers follow students, students follow production, and books, blackboards, and teaching aids follow people, persisting in teaching during busy production, so the organization of people's schools has been maintained all year round, and learning has continued uninterrupted.

### 炮火打不散　海风刮不倒  福建“铁民校”遍地开花

    炮火打不散　海风刮不倒
    福建“铁民校”遍地开花
    本报讯　长期坚持学习被群众誉为四季常青的“铁民校”，已在福建省各地农村遍地开花。
    到目前止，从海防前哨岛屿、渔村，到广大山区、林区和基本建设工地，共计已出现铁民校六千一百六十二所，每个公社平均有十所以上。在铁民校带动下，有力地促进了全省农村扫盲和业余教育不断巩固提高。现在全省农村入学和坚持常年学习的青壮年达三百一十二万人，其中参加业余高小和初中学习的青壮年达二百五十七万人。
    福建省的铁民校运动，是在各地人民公社的工农业生产获得连续大跃进、生产技术不断革新的基础上开展起来的。广大农村青壮年在大跃进中都迫切要求进一步提高文化、科学和技术水平，以适应生产大发展和实行技术革命的需要。有的群众对那些不能常年教学的民校还贴出大字报，提出批评，对能常年教学的业余学校则进行表扬，称誉为“铁民校”。各级党委和教育部门根据广大群众的这种要求，都特别重视扫盲和业余教育的领导，从省到公社层层成立文化革命或技术革命委员会，深入总结各地“铁民校”长期坚持教学和不断提高的办学经验，深入发动群众开展群众性的创办铁民校运动，从省到市、县、公社和生产大队，层层办起了一所到数所铁民校，作为推动农村业余教育的标兵和据点，使铁民校能在全省各地普遍开花。
    铁民校的共同特点是：一、由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，建立了既领导生产又领导学习的统一机构，统一安排生产和教学时间，把业余教育当作一项主要工作进行安排，经常进行检查评比，因为这些铁民校师生的热情都很高、干劲十足。二、广大基层干部在领导好业余教育同时，都能带头坚持学习，并发挥积极分子的骨干和带头作用。据统计全省各民校现在共拥有这种积极分子二十万人左右。三、这些铁民校都注意培养和提高教师，改进教学，提高教学质量，使铁民校步步提高，使广大学员学有所得、学能致用，能够长期坚持参加学习。四、各地铁民校在教学中，都能坚决贯彻结合生产、为生产服务的教学方针，作到政治、文化、技术三结合，教学组织形式、时间都能适应生产，灵活安排，因而学习能够经常持久，同时又使民校成为既是广大群众和干部学习文化、技术的场所，又是进行政治思想教育的一种群众性组织。例如海防前哨的晋江县围头半岛铁民校的三百九十多名教师和学员，从1953年办学以来的七年中，在当地党委的坚强领导下，根据前线对敌斗争和生产的特点灵活安排学习时间，坚持进行常年教学。他们在不打炮时白天生产，晚上学习文化，炮战时，他们在作好支前工作的同时，即抓紧空隙时间，以防炮洞为课堂进行学习，作到在平时集中学，紧张生产和支前时机动学、分散学。在学习中还采取政治、军事、文化、技术“四结合”，由党委委员教政治，请部队官兵教军事，老农、技术员教农业科学技术，并建立试验田，结合学习进行试验和田间实习，同时又把民校变成一种开展对敌斗争的组织，由学员结合文化学习，写标语、扎风筝、印宣传品向金门蒋军展开政治攻势。因此，既不断提高了学员的政治、军事、文化、技术水平，又推动了支援前线和生产建设，培养各方面技术人才。被广大群众称赞为“炮火打不散、海风刮不倒”的前线英雄“铁民校”，因而变成全省民校的标兵。
  福建省农村在实现了铁民校遍地开花以后，为广大农村开展经常性的业余教育创造了丰富经验，树立了良好的榜样。各级党委和教育部门都把这些铁民校，作为领导农村文化技术革命的试验田和标兵，按照不同地区、不同季节，因地制宜地总结出一套常年坚持学习和不断提高的经验，通过召开现场会、观摩会、群众评比鉴定会等形式，推广它们的先进经验，带动了一般民校共同跃进，从而促进了全省农村业余教育都能不断巩固和提高。晋江专区在总结和推广了晋江县围头半岛和南安县英都公社等铁民校创造的多种多样坚持学习经验后，各地民校都普遍采用民校跟学生走、教师跟学生走、学生跟生产走，书本、黑板、教具跟人走等“四跟四走”的办法，在生产大忙中坚持教学，因而作到了民校组织常年不散、学习不断。
