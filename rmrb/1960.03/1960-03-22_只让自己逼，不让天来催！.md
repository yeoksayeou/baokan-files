	“Only Force Ourselves, Don’t Let Heaven Urge Us!”
	Jiao Hewen
	Fight drought! Fight drought! We must fight whenever there is drought. Whenever there are signs of drought, the Party leads the people to launch a drought resistance campaign. Our Jiahe County in Hebei Province, like many other places in the country, in view of the relatively little rain and snow last winter, took the initiative to launch a drought resistance campaign in advance last winter and at the beginning of this year. The Da Wupan Management Area of ​​Hao Village Commune launched a mass drought resistance collaboration just after the Spring Festival. They drained a small river and universally irrigated the land. The soil moisture in the entire management area is very good, and the land is ready, just waiting for sowing. At that time, after a rough calculation, there were at least twenty days before the time for spring sowing required soil moisture! What kind of style is this of securing soil moisture early before it's needed, and resisting drought in advance even before there is a drought? A commune member comrade said it clearly: “We farm whether heaven helps or not, and we have a bumper harvest whether heaven helps or not! We simply don’t plan to rely on heaven to give us timely rain this year. Even if heaven now gives me a thorough rain for spring sowing, our thinking of resisting drought cannot be relaxed. The drought resistance is only complete when the grain is in the barn.”
	Resisting drought in advance before the drought demon arrives, is it shooting at random? Wait and see, wait and see, if it happens to rain, wouldn't it save effort to irrigate the fields? This kind of thinking of hoping for heaven, waiting for heaven, and watching heaven lacks the ideological preparation for ensuring a bumper harvest without rain throughout the year, and the initiative is taken away by heaven. The result of passively hoping for heaven and waiting for heaven is being forced by heaven, forcing you to dig a well when you are already thirsty, forcing you to realize it's too late to resist drought when you need water, harming production, suffering losses, and being fooled. We hope that it will rain, but we do not rely on heaven for food. If it doesn't rain, we will also get the water needed for the crops throughout the year with our hard work to ensure a bumper harvest. “Only force ourselves, don’t let heaven urge us,” we must water conservancy the land, reform and improve the water lifting tools, and increase the strength of drought resistance, to fully grasp the initiative of a bumper harvest in agricultural production.
	Heaven, oh heaven! Whether it rains or not is up to you, whether we have a bumper harvest or not is up to us. Regardless of the amount of rain this year, we have made good plans for drought resistance. If you give us favorable weather for crops, we will of course say "Good!", If it doesn't rain all year, we will still ensure a bumper harvest. We are the masters of nature!

    “只让自己逼，不让天来催！”
    焦合文
    抗旱！抗旱！有旱必抗。每逢有了旱象，党就领导着人们展开抗旱运动。我们河北交河县和全国很多地方一样，鉴于去冬雨雪较少，还在去年冬天和今年一开春，就主动地提前展开了抗旱运动。郝村公社大吴潘管理区刚刚过了春节，就来了个全民抗旱大协作。把一条小河掏干了，把地普浇一遍。全管理区的地墒情很好，大地整装以待，只等播种。当时屈指一算，离春播用墒的时间起码还有二十多天呢！这种不等用墒就早先保下墒，没有发生旱象就提前抗旱，是一种什么风格呢？一位社员同志说的明白：“有天也种地，无天也丰产！我们今年根本就没打算老天下随心雨。就算现在老天给我的春播下场透雨，我们抗旱的思想也不能松弛，多久粮食打到囤里多久抗旱算完。”
    旱魔未来，提前抗旱，是不是无的放矢呢？等等看，等等看，侥幸下了雨，不是省得费力浇田了吗？这种盼天、等天、观望天的思想，就没有全年无雨保丰收的思想准备，主动权就被老天掌握去了。站在被动地位上盼天、等天的结果，是被天逼，逼得你临渴掘井，逼得你用水时候再想抗旱来不及，害了生产，吃亏，上当。我们希望老天下雨，但不靠天吃饭。老天不下雨，凭着我们的干劲，也要弄来全年庄稼需要的水，确保丰收。“只让自己逼，不让天来催”，我们要使大地水利化，使提水工具改革又健全，使抗旱力量大，充分掌握农业生产丰收的主动权。
    老天啊，老天！下雨不下雨在你，丰产不丰产在咱，不管今年雨量大小，我们抗旱的谱打好了，你来个风调雨顺咱当然叫“好！”，你全年不雨咱也保丰产，我们是大自然的主人！
