Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) spokesperson issued a statement today, strongly condemning the U.S. government's persecution of Henry Winston.

The spokesperson said: "Henry Winston, the outstanding representative of the American working class and the excellent son of the Black people, was sentenced by the U.S. government more than four years ago to eight years in prison under the notorious 'Smith Act' for the fabricated so-called 'conspiracy' crime. During his imprisonment, he suffered from a serious illness but did not receive timely diagnosis and treatment. The strong protests of the American people forced the U.S. authorities to allow Winston to be admitted to the hospital for emergency surgery. Now, when Winston has just undergone a major surgery to remove a brain tumor, is almost completely blind, and his legs are paralyzed, the U.S. authorities are cruelly refusing to grant him parole for medical treatment and are stubbornly sending him back to prison. The Chinese working class strongly condemns this inhuman and reactionary crime of the U.S. authorities with extreme indignation."

The spokesperson said: "We know that Henry Winston has been tirelessly and arduously fighting since his youth to realize the great cause of the working class, to strive for the democracy of Black people, and for world peace. Precisely because he is such an outstanding fighter for democracy and peace, all people who love justice and peace around the world admire him. But the American ruling class hates him for this reason and tries every means to persecute him, plotting to destroy his life physically.

"However, this extremely vicious act of the U.S. authorities can never stop the just struggle of the American working class and the American people for peace and democracy. On the contrary, it can only further expose the criminal essence of the U.S. ruling clique's policies of oppressing its own people and antagonizing the people of the world through aggression and war. The working class and the people of the world more clearly recognize from this atrocity that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of all peace-loving and democratic people."

The ACFTU spokesperson concluded: "We, the Chinese working class and all the people, resolutely oppose this barbaric behavior of the U.S. rulers. We firmly support the struggle of the American working class and the people to protest this atrocity of the U.S. authorities. If the U.S. government continues to persecute Winston, it will inevitably be severely judged by the people of justice."

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th, Washington dispatch: Thirty members of the Committee to Free Henry Winston began demonstrating in front of the White House on the 8th, demanding the freedom of this Black leader of the American Communist Party who was cruelly persecuted in prison.

The demonstrators, in a petition delivered to U.S. President Eisenhower, demanded that Winston not be sent from New York to a prison in Missouri in his current critical condition. They also demanded that Winston be paroled so that he could recover from his recent brain tumor surgery.

Winston's lawyer, John Abt, filed another application with the Federal Parole Board on the 7th for Winston to be released on bail for medical treatment. A group of leaders from the Black community in New York held an emergency meeting on the same day to discuss the issue of securing Winston's release for medical treatment.

    我全总负责人发表谈话
    强烈谴责美国政府迫害温斯顿
    美国正义人士继续斗争要求政府恢复温斯顿的自由
    新华社9日讯　中华全国总工会负责人今天发表谈话，强烈谴责美国政府迫害亨利·温斯顿。
    负责人说：“美国工人阶级的优秀代表、黑人的优秀儿子亨利·温斯顿，在四年多以前被美国政府根据臭名昭著的‘史密斯法’，以莫须有的所谓‘阴谋罪’判处了八年徒刑。在监禁期间，他身患重病，却得不到及时的诊治。美国人民强烈的抗议，迫使美国当局不得不准许温斯顿进医院进行紧急手术。现在，当温斯顿刚进行过切除脑瘤的大手术后，双目几乎完全失明、双腿已经瘫痪的时候，美国当局却残忍地不让他假释出狱进行医疗，硬要把他送回监狱去。中国工人阶级以非常愤慨的心情强烈地谴责美国当局这一残无人道的反动罪行。”
    负责人说：“我们知道，亨利·温斯顿是一位从青年时代起就一直为实现工人阶级的伟大事业、为争取黑人的民主和世界和平进行不懈的和艰苦的斗争。正因为他是这样一位杰出的民主与和平的斗士，全世界一切爱好正义与和平的人民都敬仰他。但美国统治阶级却因此对他恨之入骨。想尽办法来迫害他，阴谋从肉体上来毁灭他的生命。
      “但是，美国当局这一穷凶极恶的暴行，决不能阻止美国工人阶级和美国人民为和平民主所进行的正义斗争，相反地，只能更加暴露美国统治集团所实行的压迫本国人民和敌视全世界人民的侵略和战争政策的罪恶实质。全世界工人阶级和全世界人民从这一暴行中更清楚地认清美帝国主义是一切爱好和平民主人士的头号敌人。”
    全总负责人最后说：“我们中国工人阶级和全体人民坚决反对美国统治者这种野蛮行为，我们坚决支持美国工人阶级和人民为抗议美国当局这一暴行所进行的斗争。美国政府如果继续迫害温斯顿的话，它就必将遭到正义人们严厉的裁判。”
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：争取释放亨利·温斯顿委员会的三十名委员8日开始在白宫门前示威，要求恢复这一位在监狱中被残酷迫害的美国共产党黑人领袖的自由。
    示威者在一份交给美国总统艾森豪威尔的请愿书中要求不要把温斯顿在目前病况危急的时候从纽约送到密苏里州的监狱去。他们还要求假释温斯顿，使他能够在最近进行的切除脑瘤的手术以后恢复健康。
    温斯顿的律师约翰·艾布特7日向联邦假释委员会再次提出了保释温斯顿在外治病的申请。一批纽约黑人区领袖在同一天曾举行紧急会议，讨论争取保释温斯顿在外就医的问题。
