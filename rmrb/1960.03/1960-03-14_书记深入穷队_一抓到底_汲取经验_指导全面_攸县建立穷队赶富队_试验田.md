Secretary Goes Deep into Poor Teams, Grasping to the End, Drawing on Experience, Guiding Comprehensively
You County Establishes "Experimental Fields" for Poor Teams to Catch Up with Rich Teams
Xiangyin County's Financial and Trade Departments Provide Extensive Support to Poor Teams, Various Communes and Brigades Organize Cooperation and Mutual Assistance

(Reported by our newspaper) The You County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hunan Province, in order to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, has taken measures to launch a production emulation movement throughout the county for poor teams to catch up with rich teams, low-yield teams to catch up with high-yield teams, and backward teams to catch up with advanced teams.

In organizing this year's great production movement, the You County Committee grasped the issue of high-speed balanced development from the outset. Through a comprehensive summary of the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, it conducted a baseline survey of the production status of various communes and brigades throughout the county. The results of the survey showed that, in terms of income comparison, there were twenty-five poor teams, accounting for 14.5% of the total number of brigades, with a net income of only forty-two yuan per person; in terms of grain yield, there were ten low-yield teams, accounting for 5.8% of the total number of brigades, with an average yield of less than five hundred jin per mu; in terms of work foundation, there were six backward teams, accounting for 3.5% of the total number of brigades. The County Committee believes that helping poor teams catch up with rich teams, low-yield teams catch up with high-yield teams, and backward teams catch up with advanced teams is the key to further consolidating the communes and achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year. At the same time, the County Committee studied the reasons why these teams were poor, low-yield, and backward, and took corresponding measures to launch a production movement.

The County Committee decided to organize ten County Committee members, headed by Agricultural Secretary Zuo Yuanrong, eighteen Commune Party Committee secretaries and members, and thirty cadres to go to the teams, be responsible to the end, establish five "experimental fields" for "poor catching up with rich," draw on experience, and provide comprehensive guidance. In order to overcome the "theory of conditions only" and "pessimism" among cadres and members of poor teams, the whole county used the fact that Mutuan Brigade had changed from poor to rich after a year of hard work as a model to carry out discussions, establish the lofty ambition of self-reliance, eliminate feelings of inferiority, and mobilize everyone to tap potential. According to the characteristics of each team, plans for high-speed development of production were formulated. At the same time, the County Committee and Commune Party Committees organized large-scale support and cooperation for these teams. All departments in the county regarded "poor teams as their hometowns," and sent resident cadres to assist in the work for a long time. The financial and trade departments implemented the "eight priorities" (that is, financial investment, loan disbursement, reduction and exemption of preferential treatment, supply of means of production, product purchase, repair of farm implements, food arrangement, and seed allocation are all given priority), so that each mu of land in these teams generally had sixteen yuan of production funds, three hundred jin of lime, one hundred jin of native fertilizer, and fifty jin of pesticides, and the members had tools for work. The public accumulation used by the commune to help these teams in production accounted for 50%.

In order to change the face of low-yield areas, the County Committee and relevant Commune Party Committees, according to the characteristics of each brigade, mobilized the masses to carry out the following work: 1. Vigorously transform low-yield fields. Measures such as building culverts and opening ditches to drain waterlogging; cutting mountain shade to increase sunshine hours; mixing foreign soil to increase organic fertilizer; and establishing new irrigation systems were taken to thoroughly transform cold and waterlogged fields, mountain shade fields, viscous shallow mud fields, and overflow fields. 2. After improving the soil quality, increase the multiple cropping area, change single-season rice to double-season rice, and achieve two to three crops a year, while expanding the cultivated area. 3. Build large pig farms at the head of the fields to increase pig manure accumulation, produce native chemical fertilizers in large quantities, and organize expeditions to accumulate fertilizer, applying 700 dan of high-quality fertilizer per mu of land. 4. Use improved varieties such as early rice Nantao No., mid-season rice Wanlixian, and late rice late japonica. Through these efforts, the grain yield per unit area of the ten low-yield teams in the county this year is expected to increase by one to two times compared with 1959.

For the six backward teams in the county, the County Committee, after analyzing the situation, believed that the main reason was that these teams had not formed a leading core, and the Party and League organizations were not sound enough, and so on. Therefore, the County Committee is determined to change the face of the backward teams by seizing the spring plowing production and working hard for a month. The first is to effectively strengthen leadership. The County Committee added six Commune Party Committee secretaries and twenty cadres to these teams. Second, by grasping the formulation of production plans and the "three guarantees" and other work, the masses were mobilized to carry out airing views, contending, and debating, thereby improving the ideological awareness of the masses and forming a political atmosphere in which everyone strives to be advanced. Third, through democratic discussion, members with serious capitalist ideas were removed from the team cadres, and activists were elected to the leading positions of the brigade, production team, and work group. Fourth, the Party and League organizations were established and improved, so that every production team had Party and League branches, and every work group had Party and League groups. Fifth, through top-down discussions and bottom-up revisions, labor management and production management were improved, and various effective systems were formulated.

Thanks to the above measures, the upsurge of the emulation movement of poor teams catching up with rich teams, low-yield teams catching up with high-yield teams, and backward teams catching up with advanced teams in You County is surging forward.

(Reported by our newspaper) Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, has a total of ninety-five poor teams. After a year of struggle, forty-five of them have caught up with the rich teams, and the production level and member income of the remaining fifty have also been improved to varying degrees. This year, the County Committee is determined to change the economic face of all poor teams.

As early as January, the County Committee held an on-site meeting in Songjiang Brigade of Bishi Commune, which had already changed its impoverished face, summarized the experience of Songjiang Brigade in changing from poor to rich, and further promoted the work of changing poor teams. After the on-site meeting, a movement to transform poor teams and help poor teams catch up with rich teams was launched throughout the county. The County Committee transferred seven County Committee members and one hundred and six county and commune cadres to go deep into the poor teams and strengthen leadership. The secretaries of the Party committees at all levels also generally went deep into the poor teams to find problems and solve them. Chen Bingzhi, the first secretary of the County Committee, went deep into Tongpen Brigade, which was both a poor team and a backward team, after the meeting. Through investigation, he found that this team had many difficulties in spring plowing production, lacking plows, farm tools, and funds, and he and the Commune Party Committee secretary seriously studied solutions.

In terms of the supply of means of production and production funds, various departments also gave many considerations to the poor teams. In addition to providing 1.35 million yuan of production funds and 750,000 yuan of agricultural loans to these poor teams, the County Financial and Trade Department also dispatched thirty-nine cadres to specifically help the poor teams organize funds. The County Commercial Department also, according to the characteristics of each poor team, transferred a large number of lime, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and improved varieties, farm tools, and water pumps to support them, and also helped the poor teams develop diversified economies. For example, Xinmin Brigade lacked pig sources, so the Commercial Department transferred twenty sows and four boars from other places. The handicraft industry department also dispatched three hundred and eighty-eight iron, wood, and bamboo craftsmen to help each poor team establish fifty thousand-head pig farms and set up fifty-six small factories, accelerating the economic development of the poor teams.

In the movement to help poor teams catch up with rich teams, the communes and brigades also carried forward the spirit of communist cooperation, supporting and helping each other. For example, Tongpen Brigade of Bishi Commune lacked plows and firewood, so the neighboring Yuci Brigade supported them with twenty-five plows and four firewood sources; Xinhua Brigade of Chengnan Commune lacked sweet potato seedlings, so Yuanjia Brigade supported them with 11,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings.

    书记深入穷队　一抓到底　汲取经验　指导全面
    攸县建立穷队赶富队“试验田”
    湘阴县财贸部门多方支援穷队，各公社各大队组织协作互相帮助
    本报讯　中共湖南省攸县县委为了实现今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进，采取措施，在全县开展了穷队赶富队、低产赶高产、后进赶先进的生产竞赛运动。
    攸县县委在组织今年大生产运动中，一开始就抓住了高速度平衡发展的问题，通过全面总结去年大跃进的经验，对全县各公社、大队的生产状况进行了摸底排队。排队结果：从收入比较看，有二十五个穷队，占大队总数的14．5％，这些队的纯收入每人只有四十二元；从粮食产量看，有十个低产队，占大队总数的5．8％，这些队每亩产量平均不到五百斤；从工作基础比较看，有六个后进队，占大队总数的3．5％。县委认为，帮助穷队赶上富队，低产队赶上高产队，后进队赶上先进队，是进一步巩固公社，实现今年更好更全面跃进的关键。同时，县委研究了这些队其所以穷、低产和后进的原因，并采取了相应的措施，开展了生产运动。
    县委决定以农业书记左元戎同志为首组织十个县委委员，十八个公社党委书记、党委委员和三十个干部，分头到队，负责到底，建立了五个“穷赶富”的“试验田”，吸取经验，指导全面。为了克服穷队干部、社员中的“唯条件论”、“悲观论”，全县以睦联大队苦干一年由穷变富的事实为典型，开展讨论，树立自力更生的雄心大志，消除自卑情绪，发动大家挖潜力。根据各队的特点，制订出高速度发展生产的计划。同时，县委、公社党委对这些队组织了大支援大协作，全县各部门都以“穷队当家乡”，派驻干部长期协助工作。财贸部门实行了“八在先”（即财政投资、发放贷款、减免优待、生产资料供应、产品收购、农具修造、粮食安排、种子调拨等均优先照顾），使这些队每亩田一般都有了生产资金十六元，石灰三百斤，土化肥一百斤，农药五十斤，社员出工有工具。公社用于帮助这些队生产的公共积累占50％。
    为了改变低产地区的面貌，县委和有关公社党委根据各大队的特点，发动群众开展了下列工作：一、大力改造低产田。分别采取筑涵开沟排浸；砍山荫增加日照时间；掺客土增施有机质肥料；建立新的灌溉系统等措施，把冷浸田、山荫田、粘性浅泥田、过水田加以彻底改造。二、在改良土质以后，增加复种面积，改单季稻为双季稻，做到一年两熟到三熟，同时扩大耕地面积。三、大建田头猪场增积猪肥，大制土化肥，组织远征队积肥，每亩田施优质肥料七百担。四、使用早稻南特号、中稻万利籼、晚稻晚粳等良种。经过这些努力，全县十个低产队今年粮食单位面积产量，预计可比1959年增加一倍到两倍。
    对于全县的六个后进队，县委分析情况后认为，主要是这些队没有形成领导核心，党、团组织不够健全等等。因此，县委决心通过狠抓春耕生产，大干一月，改变后进队的面貌。首先是切实加强领导。县委给这些队加派了六名公社党委书记和二十名干部。其次，抓住制订生产规划和“三包”等工作，发动群众开展了鸣放辩论，从而提高了群众的思想觉悟，形成了人人争先进的政治空气。第三，通过民主讨论，清除了队干部中有严重资本主义思想的分子，把积极分子选举到大队、生产队、作业组的领导岗位上去。第四，建立和健全了党、团组织，做到了生产队都有党、团支部，作业组都有党、团小组。第五，通过从上而下的讨论和从下而上的修改，改善了劳动管理和生产管理，并制订了行之有效的各项制度。
    由于采取了以上措施，目前攸县穷队赶富队，低产赶高产，后进赶先进的竞赛高潮正滚滚向前。
    本报讯　湖南省湘阴县共有九十五个穷队，经过一年的奋斗，已经有四十五个赶上了富队，其余五十个的生产水平和社员收入也有不同程度的提高。今年县委决心改变所有穷队的经济面貌。
    早在1月份，县委便在已经改变穷困面貌的弼时公社松江大队召开现场会，总结了松江大队由穷变富的经验，进一步推动改变穷队的工作。现场会议后，一个改造穷队、帮助穷队赶上富队的运动，便在全县范围内开展起来。县委抽调了七名县委委员，一百零六名县、社干部，深入穷队，加强领导。各级党委书记也普遍深入穷队，发现问题，解决问题。县委第一书记陈秉芝同志，在会后便深入到既是穷队又是后进队的铜盆大队，通过调查，发现这个队在春耕生产上存在着许多困难，缺耕牛、缺农具、缺资金，便和公社党委书记一道认真研究了解决办法。
    在生产资料和生产资金的供应方面，各部门也给了穷队许多照顾。县财贸部门除投放给这些穷队生产资金一百三十五万元、农贷七十五万元以外，还下放了三十九名干部具体帮助穷队组织资金。县商业部门也根据各个穷队的特点，调出了大批石灰、化肥、农药和良种、农具、抽水机加以支援，并且还帮助穷队发展多种经济。如新民大队缺少猪源，商业部门便从外地调剂来母猪二十头、公猪四头。手工业部门也下放了铁、木、篾三匠三百八十八人，帮助各个穷队建立了千头养猪场五十个，办起小型工厂五十六个，加速穷队经济的发展。
    在帮助穷队赶上富队的运动中，各公社与公社、大队与大队还发扬了共产主义协作的精神，互相支援，互相帮助。如弼时公社铜盆大队缺少耕牛和柴禾，相邻的玉池大队便支援了他们耕牛二十五头，柴源四处；城南公社新华大队缺少薯种，袁家大队就支援薯种一万一千斤。
