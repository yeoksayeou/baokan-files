Changge Vigorously Seizes High-Yield Corn Methods
80,000 Mu of Corn Land Achieves High-Standard Garden Management

(Our newspaper Zhengzhou dispatch) Changge County, Henan Province, which has historically had high corn yields, is actively preparing to sow corn. Out of the county's 100,000 mu of spring-sown corn, more than 88,000 mu have reached advanced garden management standards after spring plowing and leveling.

The broad masses of cadres and people in Changge County realize that planting more corn can not only increase grain production but also increase feed. With feed, a large number of pigs can be raised, and more fertilizer can be accumulated, so that both agriculture and animal husbandry can achieve large increases in production. Currently, a mass upsurge of increasing corn planting and greatly developing pig raising has emerged in Changge County.

In order to achieve greater corn yields, the cornfields were universally deep-plowed, winter-irrigated, and fertilized last winter, and corn high-yield plots were planned at each level. The county party committee focused on both water and fertilizer, and carried out basic water and fertilizer construction in the high-yield plots. At present, a network of channels, machine well squares, water well groups, and ponds in series have been established in the high-yield plots, achieving well-channel communication and reservoir-pond connection, capable of storing and draining water, ensuring double insurance against drought and flood. More than 5,000 pig farms, manure ponds, and fertilizer factories have been established in the high-yield plots, and more than 188.8 million jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated and produced, with an average of about 15,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer applied per mu.

In order to further increase corn yields, the county has universally summarized corn high-yield experiences. The Zhifang Brigade of Pohu Commune carried out rational close planting, retaining 3,200 seedlings per mu, with a corn yield of 750 jin per mu. Another brigade adjacent to the Zhifang Brigade only planted 2,000 plants per mu, with a corn yield of more than 420 jin per mu. The commune leadership used this obvious example to educate the broad masses, breaking many erroneous views on close planting of corn. In the process of summarizing experience, the successful experience of two crops of corn a year, tested by Ma Tongyi, an agricultural labor model in the county, was also universally promoted. In 1958, Ma Tongyi used nutrient pot seedlings and transplanted them when the first crop of corn was pulled half a month before the Beginning of Autumn, and they grew up before the Cold Dew. The 13 mu of double-season corn yielded an average of 1,400 jin per mu, of which the second crop yielded 283 jin per mu. Last year, he continued the experiment, changing from nutrient pot seedlings to intercropping between rows. The 20 mu of double-season corn yielded an average of 1,625 jin per mu, an increase of more than 52% compared with corn under the same management. This year, the Mengpai Brigade, where Ma Tongyi is located, plans to cultivate 1,500 mu of double-season corn.

To ensure increased corn production, the Changge County Party Committee assigned a secretary to take charge and specifically lead this work. Leadership groups for corn production were established at each level from the county to the commune production team. While cadres at all levels were vigorously engaged in experimental fields, they also universally mobilized the masses to engage in corn experimental fields. All corn professional team members, in addition to contracting each row by zone, also conducted experimental fields with 150 to 200 corn plants per person, striving to achieve "one jin of cob, five jin of stalk" and create experiences for higher corn yields.

    长葛大抓玉米丰产方
    八万亩玉米地达到高标准园田化
    本报郑州讯　河南省历年玉米高产的长葛县，正积极准备播种玉米，全县十万亩春播玉米，经过春耕平整，已有八万八千多亩达到了高级园田化。
    长葛县广大干部和群众都认识到多种玉米不仅可以增产粮食，而且可以增加饲料。有了饲料，就可以大量养猪，多积肥料，使农牧业都获得大增产。现在长葛县已出现了一个增种玉米和大量发展养猪的群众热潮。
    为了使玉米获得更大的丰产，在去冬即对玉米地普遍进行了深翻、冬灌、施肥，并且逐级规划了玉米丰产方。县委一手抓水，一手抓肥，在丰产方大搞水肥基本建设。目前丰产方内已建立成渠道网、机井方、水井群、塘成串，达到井渠相通，库塘相连，能蓄能排，旱涝双保险。在丰产方内建立猪场、茅池、肥料厂五千多个，已积、造各种肥料一亿八千八百多万斤，每亩平均已施入优质肥料一万五千斤左右。
    为了进一步提高玉米产量，全县普遍总结了玉米丰产经验。坡胡公社芝芳大队进行合理密植，每亩留苗三千二百株，亩产玉米七百五十斤，而与芝芳大队相邻的另一个大队，每亩只种二千棵，玉米亩产四百二十多斤。公社领导上以这个明显的事例，向广大群众进行教育，打破了对玉米密植的许多错误看法。在总结经验过程中，还普遍推广了这个县的农业劳动模范马同义等经过两年试验的玉米一年两熟的成功经验。1958年马同义用营养钵育苗，在立秋前半月拔头茬玉米时移栽，到寒露前长成，十三亩双季玉米，平均亩产一千四百斤，其中第二茬亩产二百八十三斤。去年又继续试验，变营养钵育苗为行间套种，二十亩双季玉米平均亩产一千六百二十五斤，比同样管理的玉米增产52％以上。今年马同义所在的孟排大队计划要培育双季玉米一千五百亩。
    为确保玉米增产，中共长葛县委抽出一个书记挂帅，专门领导这项工作。由县到公社生产队逐级建立了玉米生产的领导小组。在各级干部大搞试验田的同时，还普遍发动群众搞玉米试验田，所有玉米的专业队员，除分片逐垄包干外，每人还搞一百五十至二百棵玉米进行试验田，力争达到“一斤棒，五斤棵”，创造玉米更高产量的经验。
