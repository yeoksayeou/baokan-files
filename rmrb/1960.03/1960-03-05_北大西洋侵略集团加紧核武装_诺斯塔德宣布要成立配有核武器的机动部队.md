Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Paris dispatch: The United States is accelerating its efforts to arm its Western European allies with nuclear weapons under its control.

	Its most recent step is to establish a "multinational mobile special force" within the North Atlantic bloc by next year. This force will be "equipped with conventional weapons and nuclear weapons for application where needed."

	The above news was announced yesterday by the commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, American General Norstad. At a press conference held at his headquarters in the suburbs of Paris, he said that this "mobile special force" would have its own navy and air force, and it would be an "all-encompassing" army, "able to be deployed immediately to the right place at the right time."

	Norstad revealed one factor that prompted the United States to take this new step. According to the United States Information Service, Norstad, while announcing the above plan, also "recalled" the "unease" felt by the American ruling group he represented regarding "the possibility that a series of political conferences between East and West might lead to some premature detente on the (North Atlantic) alliance."

	Norstad further discussed his plan. He said that initially, this force would have three battalions, with the United States, Britain, and France each contributing one battalion. However, he hoped that this force would be expanded to "include two more countries," and eventually further expanded to "include six, seven, eight, or more countries."

	Norstad himself did not specify which countries he hoped to include in this force. However, according to the Associated Press, "West German and Belgian troops may both join this single fighting force."

	The Associated Press believes that the "important significance" of establishing this "mobile special force" lies in the fact that the United States has "taken a step forward in sharing nuclear military power with its North Atlantic allies." The American news agency also said that this plan would "complement" Norstad's plan, proposed last December, to make the North Atlantic bloc the "fourth atomic power."

	The British "Daily Mail" pointed out last month that the essence of the United States' so-called plan to allow the North Atlantic bloc to control nuclear armaments lies in: allowing West Germany to possess nuclear weapons, preventing France from becoming an "atomic nation," and forcing Britain to hand over control of its own nuclear armaments to the United States. According to this plan, in the Western bloc, only the United States will "remain an independent hydrogen power" in the future.

	Norstad admitted that he had "disagreements with the governments of three countries" when imposing this plan, which allows the United States to "merge" the armed forces of its "allies" upon these countries. He also admitted that his dispute with France has not yet been resolved.

	American officials specifically issued statements to support Norstad. On the same day that Norstad announced his plan, U.S. State Department spokesman White said that the United States "knows" and "approves" of the plan.

	At the press conference, Norstad also talked about the current nuclear armed forces of the North Atlantic bloc. He said that the missile forces of the North Atlantic bloc had "doubled" in the past year. However, he emphasized that he was not satisfied with this and that there was still a "long way to go" to make the forces of the North Atlantic bloc "100% effective."

	In November 1958, Norstad said that the North Atlantic bloc had thirty missile battalions and must increase them to one hundred battalions by 1963.

### 北大西洋侵略集团加紧核武装  诺斯塔德宣布要成立配有核武器的机动部队

    北大西洋侵略集团加紧核武装
    诺斯塔德宣布要成立配有核武器的机动部队
    新华社3日讯　巴黎消息：美国正在加快步伐使它的西欧盟国在它的控制下用核武器武装起来。
    它最近的一个步骤是使北大西洋集团在明年内建立一支“多国家的机动特别部队”，这支部队将“备有常规武器及核武器，以便在需要的地方应用”。
    上述消息是北大西洋集团军队司令、美国将军诺斯塔德昨天宣布的。他在巴黎郊区他的总部举行的一次记者招待会上说，这支“机动特别部队”将拥有自己的海军和空军，它将是一支“样样齐备”的军队，“能够在恰当的时候立即调到恰当的地方”。
    诺斯塔德透露了促使美国采取这个新步骤的一个因素。据美国新闻处报道，诺斯塔德在宣布上述计划的同时，还“追述了”他所代表的美国统治集团对“东西方举行一系列政治性会议在（北大西洋）联盟方面可能导致某种过早的缓和”感到的“不安”。
    诺斯塔德进一步谈到他的计划。他说，在开始时，这支部队将拥有三个营，由美、英、法三国各出一个营。但是，他希望这支部队将扩大到“再包括两个国家”，最后进一步扩大到“包括六个、七个、八个或更多的国家”。
    诺斯塔德本人没有说明他希望把这支部队扩大到包括哪些国家。但是，据美联社透露，“西德和比利时的部队都可能参加这支单一的战斗部队”。
    美联社认为，成立这支“机动特别部队”的“重要意义”在于，美国“向着同它的北大西洋盟国分享核军事力量前进了一步”。这家美国通讯社还说，这个计划将用诺斯塔德去年12月提出的使北大西洋集团成为“第四原子国”的计划加以“补充”。
    英国的“每日邮报”上个月曾经指出，美国的所谓让北大西洋集团控制核武装的计划，其实质在于：让西德拥有核武器，不让法国成为一个“原子国家”，并且逼迫英国向美国交出它对自己的核武装的控制权。按照这项计划，在西方集团中，今后“将只有美国保持作为一个独立的氢力量”。
    诺斯塔德承认，他在把这项使美国得以“合并”它的“盟国”的武装部队的计划强加于这些国家的时候，“同三个国家的政府发生了争执”。他还承认，他同法国之间的争执目前还没有解决。
    美国官方特地发表声明来支持诺斯塔德。在诺斯塔德宣布他的计划的当天，美国国务院发言人怀特就说，美国“知道”而且“赞成”这个计划。
    诺斯塔德在记者招待会上还谈到北大西洋集团目前的核武装力量。他说，北大西洋集团的导弹部队在去年一年中“增加了一倍”。但是，他强调，他对这一点并不满意，还要“走很多路”来使北大西洋集团的部队“100％地有效”。
    1958年11月间诺斯塔德说，北大西洋集团有三十个导弹营，必须在1963年以前增加到一百个营。
