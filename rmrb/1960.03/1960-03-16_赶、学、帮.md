Catch Up, Learn, Help
Jiang Weicai

A vigorous socialist emulation movement has been launched in Jiangsu Province with "Northern Jiangsu catching up with Southern Jiangsu" and in the Zhenjiang region with "catching up with Suzhou, surpassing Suzhou." This emulation movement is characterized by three aspects: first, catching up; second, learning; and third, helping.

Catching up is a concrete manifestation of refusing to lag behind and striving for the top. In order to accelerate socialist construction, many backward regions are determined to catch up with and surpass advanced regions. These backward regions, in terms of objective conditions such as water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, and even farming techniques, are not as good as the advanced regions, but in terms of subjective conditions such as lofty aspirations and revolutionary drive, they are not behind the advanced regions. Things are constantly changing. Today's backwardness may be tomorrow's advancement. As long as backward regions have lofty aspirations and revolutionary drive, it is entirely possible to catch up with or surpass advanced regions. There are two completely different methods of catching up. One is to learn while catching up, learn from the experience of advanced regions, and apply advanced experience to one's own work. In this way, not only can one advance as rapidly as the advanced regions, but also avoid the long and winding roads that the advanced regions have taken; the other is to only catch up without learning, work hard with one's head down, relying on one's own exploration in everything, making slow progress while others advance quickly, and even repeating the long and winding roads that others have taken. It is very difficult to catch up with advanced regions in this way.

Learning is one of the main ways for backward regions to catch up with advanced regions. Learning is not only a matter for backward regions, but also for advanced regions. Any advanced region can only continue to move forward by constantly absorbing rich nourishment; otherwise, it may be left behind. The Zhenjiang region learns from the advanced experience of the Suzhou region, while the Suzhou region also learns from the brother regions that are catching up with it through visits and other methods. Both of these types of learning are worthy of great promotion. The more one learns, the faster one catches up.

Helping is inseparable from learning. Only when one is willing to learn and the other is willing to help can backward regions quickly catch up with advanced regions. Of course, for backward regions to catch up with advanced regions, they must mainly rely on their own efforts to boost morale and learn from advanced experience. However, advanced regions have a responsibility to help backward regions. "A single flower does not make spring, only a riot of color makes spring." This is the light of communist thought. The comrades in the Suzhou region deeply understand the meaning of this sentence. Therefore, they regard helping brother regions and advancing together as their greatest glory. They not only introduce their best experience to brother regions, but also provide various necessary material support. In fact, in our society, helping others advance is also spurring oneself forward, because when backward regions advance, advanced regions need to advance even more.

Catch up, learn, and help are concrete manifestations of the communist style. It is precisely because this style has taken deep root among the people of the whole country that we can see the socialist emulation upsurge of chasing and catching up everywhere. When one group of people walks ahead, another group of people closely follows to catch up. Precisely because of this, industrial production, agricultural production, and various other constructions are leaping forward year after year, month after month, day after day, and hour after hour. Many regions and units have already crossed 1960 and entered 1961, 1962, or 1963.

Long live catching up, learning, and helping! Long live the communist style!

    赶、学、帮
    姜韦才
    江苏省掀起了一个“苏北赶江南”、镇江专区“赶苏州、超苏州”专区轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛运动，这种竞赛运动的特点表现在三个方面：一曰赶，二曰学，三曰帮。
    赶，是不甘落后、力争上游的具体表现，为了加速社会主义建设，许多后进地区决心赶上先进地区，超过先进地区。这些后进地区，论客观条件，如水利、肥料、土壤以至耕作水平，都不及先进地区，论主观条件，如雄心壮志、革命干劲，并不落后于先进地区。事物是在不断变化着的，今天是后进，明天就可能是先进，只要后进地区有雄心壮志、革命干劲，完全有可能赶上或超过先进地区。赶，有两种完全不同的方法，一种是边赶边学，学习先进地区经验，把先进经验运用到自己的工作中去。这样，不仅可以和先进地区一样大步前进，而且可以避免先进地区曾经走过的远路、弯路；另一种是只赶不学，埋头苦干，事事靠自己摸索，别人前进得很快，自己前进得很慢；甚至还要重复别人走过的远路、弯路。这样就很难赶上先进地区。
    学，这是后进赶先进的主要方法之一。学，不仅仅是后进地区的事，也是先进地区的事，任何一个先进地区，只有不断地摄取丰富的养料，才有可能不断地前进，否则，就有被丢在后面的可能。镇江专区学习苏州专区的先进经验，而苏州专区也通过参观等办法向正在赶自己的兄弟地区学习。这两种学习，都值得大大提倡，这两种学习，都是学得愈多，赶的愈快。
    帮，和学是不可分割的，一个愿学，一个愿帮，后进地区才能够很快赶上先进地区。当然后进地区要赶上先进地区，主要靠自己鼓足干劲和学习先进经验。但是先进地区有责任帮助后进地区。“一花独放不是春，万紫千红才是春”。这是共产主义思想的光芒。苏州专区的同志们深深懂得这句话的含义。因此，他们把帮助兄弟地区和自己共同前进看做是自己最大的光荣，他们不仅把自己最好的经验介绍给兄弟地区，而且还给予各种必要的物质支援。其实，在我们社会里，帮助别人前进，也就是鞭策自己前进，因为后进地区前进了，先进地区就更加需要前进。
    赶、学、帮，是共产主义风格的具体表现。正因为这种风格在全国人民中深深扎下了根子，到处可以看到你追我赶的社会主义竞赛热潮，一批人走到了前边，另一批人就紧跟着赶上去。正因为如此，工业生产，农业生产和其他各种建设，年年跃进，月月跃进，日日跃进，时时跃进，许多地区许多单位早已跨过了1960年，进入了1961年或1962年1963年。
    赶、学、帮万岁！共产主义风格万岁！
