Rice hulls, also known as rice husks, are distinct from rice bran. Rice bran is the outer layer of rice grains, rich in protein, rice oil, and Vitamin B, making it a highly nutritious feed for pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and other poultry. Rice hulls, however, contain many indigestible substances and have little nutritional value, so they cannot be used as feed alone. In the past, in many rice-producing provinces (autonomous regions) of China, farmers used rice hulls as fuel, and industrial departments also used a small portion of rice hulls as filling material inside sealed packaging boxes for machinery and instruments. However, after comprehensive utilization, rice hulls can yield many important organic chemical raw materials, such as furfural, methanol, acetone, and so on. These raw materials can be further processed into plastics, synthetic fibers, pesticides, and other chemical products.

With the continuous increase in grain production in our country, under the leadership of the Party, our people have emancipated their minds and boldly created, doing a lot of work on the comprehensive utilization of rice hulls. First, rice hulls can be hydrolyzed to extract furfural, which can be used to produce synthetic fibers (nylon 66, nylon 6, nylon 610), pesticides, and plastics, all of which are used in large quantities in our country. The extraction of furfural from rice hulls can be done using indigenous methods. Second, rice hull dry distillation can be carried out at a temperature of around 400 degrees Celsius. Thermal cracking can yield methanol, acetone, acetic acid, light oil, asphalt, and so on. After dry distillation, there are two kinds of residue: black, called rice hull charcoal, and white, called rice hull ash. These can also be used to make activated carbon and water glass. Activated carbon can be used in large quantities in the sugar industry. Recently, some factories have used rice hull charcoal as a filler for phenolic plastics, replacing wood flour. Rice hull ash can also be made into water glass and white carbon black, which is used in the rubber industry and performs better than clay. The gas obtained from rice hull dry distillation is called rice hull gas, which can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines after washing. Every two kilograms of rice hulls is equivalent to one kilogram of coal.

The effect of comprehensive utilization of rice hulls is significant. After hydrolyzing and dry distilling 1,000 kilograms of rice hulls, the following products can be obtained: (See attached chart)

After comprehensive utilization, the total output value of the products obtained per ton can reach several hundred yuan.

Our country produces more than 50 billion jin of rice hulls annually. If one-fifth of this is used annually to process chemical raw materials, it will not affect the people's communes' power generation, gas production, internal combustion engine power, or farmers' household fuel. After utilizing 10 billion jin of rice hulls, the country can create 1.7 billion yuan of wealth annually. Our country is the world's largest producer of rice, and the source of rice hulls is abundant, which is rare in the world. The finished products produced by the comprehensive utilization of rice hulls, such as furfural and activated carbon, will also become the cheapest products. Since rice hulls are a large source of raw materials in our country, the industry of comprehensive utilization of rice hulls has all the conditions to become a unique organic chemical industry in our country.

The technological processes for rice hull hydrolysis and dry distillation are very simple, and the equipment can be either indigenous or foreign. If these factories can be established in various rural areas across the country, bringing technology to the countryside and cultivating chemical cadres nationwide, it will be of extremely important significance for expanding the chemical technology workforce. Because the technological process of comprehensive utilization of rice hulls includes many basic chemical unit operations, such as dry distillation, distillation, concentration, crystallization, filtration, washing, cooling, and precipitation, rice hull comprehensive utilization factories will become excellent bases for training chemical technicians.

Although our country has done a lot of work in the comprehensive utilization of rice hulls, due to the short time, there are still some technical problems that need to be solved. For example, the structure of large-scale internal combustion furnaces for rice hull dry distillation still needs to be further improved and enhanced. The research and application of the mixed liquid and tar liquid obtained from dry distillation, the fractionation of rice hull dry distillation, and the activated treatment methods of rice hull charcoal, etc. These problems can be completely solved by mobilizing the masses, discussing and researching together, and attacking the fortresses with the power of the masses, and will be quickly resolved. There are also many experiences that can be summarized, improved, and promoted step by step in a planned way, such as normal pressure hydrolysis. Changsha, Hunan, has successful experience, but currently consumes a lot of sulfuric acid. They plan to increase the yield of furfural (93% content) to six jin per hundred jin of rice hulls, consuming eight jin of sulfuric acid (93%) and ten jin of salt. Wooden steamers can be used under normal pressure.

Currently, Changsha in Hunan, and Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai in Jiangsu have adopted indigenous methods for the comprehensive utilization of rice hulls. However, some individual factories have poor product quality and high costs because the technology has not been fully mastered. On the other hand, some products are difficult to sell temporarily due to the large production in various places, or the raw materials cannot be fully supplied, and the factories cannot produce normally. This shows that the comprehensive utilization of rice hulls must also be included in the national plan and production should be planned according to the needs of various regions.

If the comprehensive utilization of rice hulls is fully developed in our country, turning waste into gold, it will undoubtedly become a new source of chemical raw materials in our country and will build a series of unique industries for our country. With the leadership of the Party, under the shining of the General Line, as long as we go all out, aim high, and give full play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to speak, we are confident that we can quickly solve the new problems brought about by new things in a short period of time. The desire to use rice hulls as fuel for portable boilers and to use rice hull gas as power for tractors will surely be realized.

    稻糠—化工原料丰富的源泉
    化学工业部副部长　侯德榜
    稻壳也叫稻糠，它和米糠是有区别的。米糠是大米的外皮，含有多量的蛋白质、米油和维他命乙等，是猪、鸡、鸭、鹅的最有滋养的饲料；而稻壳含有许多不消化物，营养料少，所以不能单独作饲料。过去，在我国许多产稻谷的省份（自治区），农民都用稻壳做燃料，工业部门也曾用一小部分稻壳作为机械、仪表密闭包装箱内的充填物。可是稻糠经过综合利用以后，可以得到许多重要的有机化工原料。例如糠醛、甲醇、丙酮等等，这些原料还可以进一步加工成塑料、合成纤维、农药和其他化工产品。
    随着我国粮食的不断增产，我国人民在党的领导下，解放了思想，大胆地创造，在稻糠综合利用上做了很多工作。一、稻糠经过水解可以提取糠醛，制成合成纤维（尼龙66、尼龙6、尼龙610）、农药和塑料等，这些产品在我国的用量很大。在稻糠内提取糠醛可以采用土法。二、稻壳干馏在四百度左右的温度中进行热裂，还可以得到甲醇、丙酮、醋酸、轻油、沥青等等。干馏后有两种残渣，黑的叫糠炭，白的叫糠灰，还可以制活性炭、水玻璃。活性炭可以大量用于制糖工业。近来有些工厂用糠炭做酚醛塑料的填充料，代替木粉。炭灰还可以制成水玻璃、制造白炭黑，用于橡胶工业，在性能上比用陶土好。稻糠干馏得到的气体叫糠煤气，经过洗涤，可做内燃机的燃料。每两公斤稻糠可抵一公斤煤。
    稻壳综合利用的效果很大，一千公斤稻壳经过水解和干馏以后，可以得到下列产品：（附图表）
    稻壳综合利用以后，每吨所得产品的总产值就可以得到数百元。
    我国每年所产稻糠总量五百亿斤以上。如果每年用五分之一加工生产化工原料，并不影响人民公社发电、发生煤气或发动内燃机动力和农民家庭燃料。一百亿斤稻糠利用以后，每年可为国家创造十七亿元的财富。我国是世界上产稻米最多的国家，而稻糠的来源丰富，又是世界上所少有的。稻糠综合利用所生产的成品如糠醛、活性炭也将成为最廉价的产品。稻糠既是我国数量很大的原料，因此，稻糠综合利用工业也就有一切条件成为我国独特的有机化学工业。
    稻糠水解和干馏的工艺流程很简单，设备可土可洋。这种工厂如果能在全国各个农村办起来，使技术下乡，在全国范围内培养化工干部，这对扩大化工技术队伍有极其重要的意义。因为稻糠综合利用的工艺过程包括许多基本的化工单元操作，如干馏、蒸馏、浓缩、结晶、过滤、洗涤、冷却和沉淀等等，稻壳综合利用工厂将成为培养化工技术人员极好的基地。
    我国在稻糠综合利用方面虽然做了很多工作，但因时间不长，还有些技术性的问题需要解决。如大型的稻壳干馏的内燃式炉子的结构，还有不少地方需要继续改进和提高。干馏所得的混合液和焦油液的研究和应用，稻壳干馏分馏和糠炭的活性处理方法等等，这些问题完全可以发动群众，共同讨论和研究，用群众的力量攻克堡垒，会很快得到解决。也有许多经验可以总结、提高和有步骤有计划地推广，如常压水解，湖南长沙就有成功的经验，只是目前消耗硫酸较多。他们准备把每百斤稻糠提高到产六斤糠醛（含量93％），消耗八斤硫酸（93％），十斤食盐。用常压故可用木甑。
    现在湖南长沙和江苏常州、无锡、苏州和上海等地已采用土法综合利用稻糠。但有个别工厂因技术没有完全掌握，产品质量差，成本高，另一方面，某些产品，因为各地生产很多，一时销不出去，或者原料不能充分供应，工厂不能正常生产。这说明稻壳综合利用也必须纳入国家计划，并应根据各地的需要，进行有计划的生产。
    稻糠综合利用若在我国全面发展，化废物为黄金，无疑地将成为我国化工原料的一个新的来源，而且将为我国建成一系列的独特的工业。我们有党的领导，在总路线的照耀下，只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，发挥敢想、敢干、敢说的共产主义风格，一些新事物带来的新问题，我们有信心能够在不长的时间内迅速解决。用稻糠为锅驼机的燃料，用糠煤气为拖拉机的发动能源的愿望，一定能够实现。
