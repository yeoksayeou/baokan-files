Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th - Support Latin American People's Week solemnly opened this morning in front of the monument to Cuba's national hero and outstanding anti-imperialist fighter of Latin America, José Martí. Representatives from Cuban political circles, mass organizations, and well-known figures from Latin America attended the opening ceremony. People laid flowers in front of Martí's monument.

Speakers at today's conference unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism as the number one enemy of the people of all countries and called for the establishment of a united front of the people of Latin American countries to expel U.S. imperialism and the dictators it supports from their lands.

Vicente Lombardo Toledano, President of the Latin American Workers' Confederation, said at the opening ceremony that the Cuban revolution heralded the beginning of a series of revolutions that will take place in Latin America. Whether U.S. monopoly organizations like it or not, Latin America will change its semi-colonial structure and eliminate its dependent status. He said that the struggle of the Latin American people is a life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism, which is the main obstacle to their progress. Lombardo Toledano condemned the exploitation of Latin American countries by U.S. investors. He said that the time has come for Latin Americans to recover the wealth that has been plundered from them by U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that the Cuban revolution opened up the era of the second great liberation revolution in the Americas and called for strong support for the Cuban revolution.

América Castilla, a member of the preparatory committee for Support Latin American People's Week, said that the activities of Support Latin American People's Week will set off a larger-scale struggle in Latin America. He demanded the release of Puerto Rican patriot Albizu Campos, who is imprisoned by the United States.

Farbrizio Ojeda, Chairman of the Patriotic Committee of Venezuela and Congressman who led the overthrow of the Jiménez tyranny, said in his speech that the Organization of American States and the so-called "continental solidarity" only served to strengthen imperialism's rule over Latin America. He condemned the United States for launching price wars on Latin American raw material exports, reducing import quotas, and threatening invasion.

René Anillo of the Cuban Revolutionary Directorate stated that the Cuban people support the people of Latin American countries who are under tyrannical rule and colonial oppression.

Patino Iglesias, a member of the Executive Committee of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, exposed the shameful faces of the imperialist aggressors who oppose the Cuban revolution. He said that the United States supported Trujillo in the Dominican Republic and supported other dictators. He emphasized that therefore, the struggle of the Latin American people is a struggle to expel the common enemy.

Those who attended the opening ceremony responded with warm applause to the proposals put forward by the speakers and the purpose of Support Latin American People's Week.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th - This afternoon, a tribute rally to the Latin American people was held here, as part of the activities of Support Latin American People's Week which began today. Speakers at the meeting expressed their opposition to dictatorial rule and their intention to support each other in the struggle against U.S. imperialist oppression.

The venue was crowded with excited workers and students, who cheered for the neatly uniformed male and female militiamen and rebel soldiers.

At the beginning of the meeting, the declaration of principles of the preparatory committee for Support Latin American People's Week was read. The declaration stated, "The force that keeps our people in backwardness and poverty and opposes the independent development and progress of our countries is the force of U.S. imperialism."

Captain Emilio Aragones, leader of the Cuban "July 26th Movement," condemned U.S. imperialism's consistent policy of military intervention and military occupation in Latin America throughout history, as well as its practice of installing dictators and puppets. He said that Cuba is the front line in defending the Latin American revolution. He said that despite imperialist aggression, Cuba will not lose the support of its fraternal peoples.

Juan Huarte, Foreign Relations Secretary of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, said that despite the United States storing atomic bombs in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican people will never succumb in their struggle for independence and against the U.S. oppressors. When he demanded the release of the Nationalist Party leader Albizu Campos, who was imprisoned in Puerto Rico, the participants all stood up and cheered, expressing their support for this demand.

Algerian Catholic priest Beranger also spoke at the conference. He said that Algerian patriots are determined to fight to the end and will never give up until they achieve independence.

The speakers at the meeting also included Dr. Tulio Avilo, a Dominican exile, René Depestre, a Haitian poet and democratic fighter, and Armando Amador, a Nicaraguan exile. They unanimously condemned the United States for supporting the dictatorial regimes in their countries and stated: Any aggression against Cuba is an aggression against the entire Latin America; defending and saving Cuba is the central task of Latin Americans.

The conference read out congratulatory telegrams from Chinese and Korean youth expressing their support for the Cuban revolution amid applause.

The Cuban Rebel Army Choir performed at the meeting, singing the Land Reform March, the Militia March, and other revolutionary songs.

Dr. Carlos Olivares Sanchez, Foreign Relations Secretary of the "July 26th Movement," pointed out in his concluding remarks at the conference that under the guidance of the slogan "Homeland or Death," the people of Latin American countries will fight against the common enemy—imperialism.
