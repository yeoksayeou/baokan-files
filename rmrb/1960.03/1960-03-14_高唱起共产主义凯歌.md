Singing Loudly the Paean of Communism
　　Lü Ming

　　After seeing the play "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" performed by the China Youth Art Theatre, I received another vivid lesson in communism. Through vivid stage images, the artists of the China Youth Art Theatre deeply conveyed to the broad audience the great class love of our people and the revolutionary optimism of the working people in overcoming all difficulties, as well as the Party and Chairman Mao's infinite care for the people. The old boatman in the play, full of spirit, driving his small wooden boat to cross the Yellow River at night and battling the raging waves, the heroic spirit of the People's Air Force overcoming the dangers of nature, the boiling scene of the people of Pinglu County waiting for the "miracle drug" sent by Chairman Mao... all are exciting and unforgettable.

　　From this performance, we saw the political enthusiasm and soaring drive of all comrades in the China Youth Art Theatre; in just a few short days, they sang a resounding paean of communism. As a play-loving audience member, I hope that our drama workers, who have a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, can sing more and better paeans of communism for our great era.

    高唱起共产主义凯歌
    吕明
    看了中国青年艺术剧院上演的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”，我又上了一堂生动的共产主义课程。中国青年艺术剧院的艺术家们通过生动的舞台形象，使广大观众深深地体会到我国人民伟大的阶级友爱和劳动人民克服一切困难的革命乐观主义精神，以及党和毛主席对人民的无限关怀。剧中老船工精神焕发，驾起小木船夜渡黄河同惊涛骇浪搏斗的气魄，人民空军战胜大自然险阻的英雄气概，平陆县人民等待毛主席送来“神药”的沸腾场景……都是激动人心，令人难忘的。
    从这个演出中，使我们看到了中国青年艺术剧院全体同志的政治热情和冲天干劲；虽然不过短短的几天，他们就唱出了一首响亮的共产主义凯歌。作为一个爱好话剧的观众，希望我们有着光荣的革命战斗传统的话剧工作者，能为我们这个伟大的时代唱出更多更好的共产主义凯歌。
