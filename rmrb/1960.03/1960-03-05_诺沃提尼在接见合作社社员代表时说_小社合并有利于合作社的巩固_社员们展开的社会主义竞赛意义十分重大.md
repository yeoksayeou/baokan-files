Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 3rd: Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Republic, said on the 2nd that the emulation campaigns and initiatives of members of unified agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia have achieved good results. He said that the achievements of socialist transformation of agriculture in our country are manifested not only in the fact that the land cultivated by cooperatives accounts for the vast majority of the country's cultivated land, but also mainly in the fact that cooperatives are constantly providing more and more agricultural products to the entire society. He expressed encouragement for the efforts made by some cooperatives in merging small cooperatives into large ones. Novotný made these remarks on the 2nd when receiving a delegation of cooperative members selected from various cooperatives in the Přerov region. This delegation reported to President Novotný on the great achievements they had made in agriculture last year. Novotný praised their achievements. He said that there are already many examples showing that the production tasks that the Přerov region cooperatives stipulated to be completed in 1965 will be able to be completed in 1963 or 1964. The guarantees put forward and the socialist emulation campaigns launched by the cooperatives to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of Czechoslovakia's liberation are of great significance. This kind of enthusiasm not only greatly promotes the increase of agricultural production, but also greatly affects the entire life of the countryside.
    Novotný emphasized the importance of merging small cooperatives into large ones. He pointed out that a cooperative with four to five hundred hectares of land can be considered as a basic unit. Merging cooperatives will be conducive to consolidating cooperatives and can improve their economic results and increase the wealth of the cooperatives.
    Novotný spoke about the importance of improving the management and organization of agricultural production, saying that thousands of new experts and tested staff will go to the cooperatives and local people's committees to work with the members to ensure the completion of agricultural production tasks.

    诺沃提尼在接见合作社社员代表时说
    小社合并有利于合作社的巩固
    社员们展开的社会主义竞赛意义十分重大
    新华社布拉格3日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记、共和国总统诺沃提尼在2日说，捷克斯洛伐克的统一农业合作社社员的竞赛和倡议获得了很好的效果。他说，我们国家农业社会主义改造的成绩，不仅表现在合作社所耕种的土地已占全国耕地的绝大部分，而且主要地表现在合作社不断向整个社会提供越来越多的农产品。他对一些合作社在并小社为大社方面所作的努力表示鼓励。诺沃提尼是在2日接见普累罗夫县各个合作社所选派的社员代表团时说这些话的。这个代表团向诺沃提尼总统报告了他们去年在农业方面所获得的巨大成就。诺沃提尼赞扬了他们所获得的成就。他说，已经有很多例子表明，普累罗夫县合作社规定在1965年完成的生产任务将能够在1963年或1964年完成。合作社为庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年而提出的保证和展开社会主义竞赛有十分重大的意义。这种积极性不仅大大地促进农业生产的提高，而且也大大地影响农村的整个生活。
    诺沃提尼强调指出了合作社并小社为大社的重要意义。他指出，拥有四百到五百公顷土地的合作社可以考虑作为一个基本单位。并社的做法会有利于合作社的巩固，并能改善它们的经济效果和增加合作社的财富。
    诺沃提尼在谈到了改善农业生产的管理和组织的重要意义，他说，全国将有几千名新专家和经过考验的工作人员到合作社和地方人民委员会去工作，以便同社员一起来保证农业生产任务的完成。
