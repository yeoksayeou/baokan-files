Beekeeping Has Many Benefits
By Our Correspondent

Beekeeping is a productive undertaking with multiple benefits. Its direct income greatly exceeds that of general agriculture. According to a survey in Conghua County, Guangdong, the annual income from a hive of bees is about 120 yuan, and one worker can manage 20 to 30 hives, worth more than 2,000 yuan. More importantly, beekeeping plays a huge role in increasing agricultural production. Bees are the "matchmakers" for the pollination of various crops, indirectly and significantly improving the yield and quality of crops. According to experiments conducted by twenty research units in 1959, rapeseed production increased by 50% with bees as pollinators compared to without bees, sunflowers by 30%, cotton by 23%, and fruits such as apples and citrus fruits doubled. It is thus evident that beekeeping is a sideline in the diversified operations of people's communes with multiple benefits and broad prospects for development.

Bees are also humanity's "friends of health." Its product, honey, is an excellent nutritional supplement, proven to treat chronic gastrointestinal diseases, hypertension, liver disease, kidney disease, and various other ailments. Another product of bees, "royal jelly" (a substance secreted by the hypopharyngeal glands of worker bees used to feed the queen bee), holds a unique position in medicine, capable of strengthening weakened individuals and having excellent therapeutic effects on neurasthenia, malnutrition, heart disease, diabetes, and more. Bee venom has special effects on treating rheumatic arthritis, and propolis is even more effective in treating corns. Beeswax has a wide range of uses and is in high demand in the electrical, aviation, automobile manufacturing, textile, and defense industries. Honey and beeswax are also popular export commodities; exporting one ton of honey can be exchanged for three tons of steel or six tons of chemical fertilizer.

Our country has a vast territory with extremely rich sources of nectar-bearing plants, including forests, grasslands, orchards, and farmland, allowing for the great development of beekeeping. China is one of the earliest countries in the world to practice beekeeping. As early as more than two thousand years ago, our ancestors raised bees. However, in old China, like other industrial and agricultural production, beekeeping production long failed to receive the development it deserved. After liberation, China's beekeeping industry underwent great changes. Especially under the impetus of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, beekeeping also witnessed a new era of vigorous development. In 1959, the number of bee colonies nationwide reached 4.95 million, an increase of 65% compared to 1958, equivalent to nine times that of 1949. The output of honey and beeswax also increased significantly. However, China's beekeeping production still has great potential for development. Calculated by land area, there is currently only one bee colony for every two square kilometers, which is very low compared to countries with developed beekeeping industries. From the perspective of unit yield, advanced apiaries can produce an average of 800 catties of honey per colony, while most apiaries produce only dozens of catties per colony. Therefore, people's communes in various regions still need to vigorously promote various advanced experiences and technological innovation measures in beekeeping production, accelerate the breeding of bee colonies, and improve the productivity of bee colonies.

Faster reproduction of bee colonies and greater increases in honey and wax production are the basic requirements of beekeeping production. The saying that "breeding bee colonies and increasing honey cannot be achieved simultaneously" is unfounded. The abundant production experiences of beekeeping in various regions in 1959 have proven with countless brilliant facts that bees, honey, and wax can be completely obtained with high yields and abundant harvests at the same time. The most outstanding example is the thousand-catty bee colony cultivated by the beekeeping production team of the Zhaixi People's Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang, reported in today's newspaper. Comrades Jiang Xiaomao and Xu Beichen of this beekeeping team, with their soaring enthusiasm of "people never leaving the bees, bees never leaving the flowers, chasing flowers to seize honey," created a new record last year of ten bee colonies producing a total of 14,160 catties of commercial honey in one year, with an average honey production of 1,416 catties per colony, 18 catties of wax, and the bee colonies also multiplied six times.

Honey source is the material foundation of beekeeping production, just like the relationship between feed crops and animal husbandry production. Various regions need to conduct a more comprehensive survey of the types, distribution, area, and flowering period of nectar-bearing plants, as a basis for planning the development of beekeeping production. Heilongjiang Province has now initially completed the survey of nectar-bearing plants throughout the province. According to the survey calculation, the province can accommodate 5 million bee colonies (approximately equal to the total number of existing bee colonies in the country), while currently there are only 200,000 bee colonies in the province, indicating that the potential for developing beekeeping production is very large.

Bees have a pollination-increasing effect on fruit trees, forest trees, and pasture seeds. At the same time, fruit trees, forest trees, and pastures are mostly good honey sources for beekeeping. Therefore, while establishing feed bases for animal husbandry, cultivating fruit trees on a large scale, and afforesting, various regions can combine the development of beekeeping production and study the implementation of their interconnected production measures. For example, using bees to pollinate fruit trees and pastures to increase production, while fruit trees and pastures provide a large amount of honey source for beekeeping production; developing animal husbandry with pasture, and using livestock manure as fertilizer for fruit trees and feed crops, and so on. This method of vigorously developing and comprehensively operating animal husbandry, fruit tree horticulture, afforestation, and beekeeping production will make the lives of our people become more prosperous and beautiful day by day!

    养蜂好处多
    本报评论员
    养蜂是一项有多种收益的生产事业。它的直接收益，大大高出于一般农业的收益。据广东从化县调查，一箱蜜蜂一年的收入约为一百二十元左右，一个劳力可以养二十到三十箱，价值当在二千元以上。更重要的是养蜂业对农业增产有巨大的作用。蜜蜂是各种农作物受粉的“月下老人”，它能间接地使农作物的产量和质量显著提高。根据1959年二十个研究单位的实验证明，有蜜蜂比没有蜜蜂作媒介，油菜可增产50％，向日葵可增产30％，棉花可增产23％，苹果、柑桔等增产一倍。由此可见，养蜂事业是人民公社多种经营中有多方面利益和广阔发展前途的一种副业。
    蜜蜂又是人类的“健康之友”。它的产品蜂蜜是极好的营养品，已经证明可以治疗慢性肠胃病、高血压、肝脏病、肾脏病等多种疾病。蜜蜂的另一种产品“王浆”（工蜂咽腺分泌的一种物质用来喂养蜂王），在医学上有它独特的地位，能使衰弱的人增强体力，对于神经衰弱、营养不良、心脏病、糖尿病等有很好的治疗效果。蜂毒对治疗风湿性关节炎，蜂胶对治疗鸡脚眼更有特殊的效果。蜂蜡用途很广，在电气、航空、汽车制造、纺织业以及国防工业方面都很需要。蜂蜜和蜂蜡也是很受欢迎的出口物资，出口一吨蜂蜜可换回三吨钢或六吨化肥。
    我国幅员广大，有极为丰富的森林、草原、果园、农田等蜜源植物，可以大大发展养蜂事业。我国是世界上最早养蜂的国家之一。远在两千多年以前，我们的祖先就饲养蜜蜂。但是在旧中国，正如其他工农业生产一样，养蜂生产也长期得不到应有的发展。解放以后，我国的养蜂事业起了很大的变化。特别是在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的推动下，养蜂业也出现了蓬勃发展的新面貌。1959年全国蜂群达到四百九十五万群，比1958年增长65％，等于1949年的九倍。蜂蜜和蜂蜡的产量也有很大增加。但我国养蜂生产还有很大的发展潜力。以国土面积计算，现在每二平方公里才有一群蜂，这同世界上养蜂业发达的国家比较起来是很低的。从单位产量上来看，先进的蜂场平均每群蜂可产蜜八百斤，而大部分蜂场每群蜂的产量不过几十斤。因此，各地人民公社还需要大力推广养蜂生产的各项先进经验和技术革新措施，加速蜂群的繁殖和提高蜂群的生产率。
    蜂群更快的繁殖，更多的增产蜜和蜡，是养蜂生产的基本要求。“繁殖蜂群和多收蜜不能兼得”的说法是没有根据的。1959年各地养蜂的丰产经验已经以无数光辉的事实证明了蜂、蜜、蜡三者完全可以同时获得高产丰收。最突出的是本报今天报道的浙江桐庐县窄溪人民公社养蜂生产队所培养的千斤蜂群。这个养蜂队的江小毛和徐北成同志以“人不离蜂、蜂不离花、追花夺蜜”的冲天干劲，在去年创造了十群蜂一年共产商品蜜一万四千一百六十斤，平均每群蜂产蜜一千四百一十六斤，产蜡十八斤，蜂群还繁殖了六倍的新纪录。
    蜜源是养蜂生产的物质基础，等于饲料作物之于畜牧生产的关系一样。各地需要更全面调查蜜源植物的种类、分布、面积和花期等情况，作为规划发展养蜂生产的依据。黑龙江省现在已初步完成了全省的蜜源植物的调查工作。根据调查计算，全省可容纳五百万群蜜蜂（约等于全国现有的蜂群总数），而目前全省仅有二十万群，可见发展养蜂生产的潜力是很大的。
    蜜蜂对果树、林木和牧草种子都有着授粉增产的作用，同时果树、林木和牧草又大都是养蜂的良好蜜源。因此，各地在建立畜牧业的饲料基地、大规模栽培果树、绿化造林的同时，都可以结合发展养蜂生产，研究实现它们之间的连锁性生产措施。例如利用蜜蜂为果树、牧草授粉增产，而果树、牧草又为养蜂生产提供大量的蜜源；以牧草发展畜牧业，以牲畜粪作为果树和饲料作物的肥料等等。这种大力发展和综合经营畜牧业、果树园艺、绿化造林以及养蜂生产的办法，将使我国人民的生活一天比一天变得更加富足美好！
