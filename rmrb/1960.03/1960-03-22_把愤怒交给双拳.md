A Song for the People of Latin America

    Give Anger to Fists
    Luojia
    My heart
    According to a report in the Cuban rebel army newspaper "Verde Olivo": In order to defend the Cuban Revolution, one million militiamen will be organized before May Day.
    My heart, my brothers offered their heads to this land,
    Falling down still kissing the blood-stained Cuban flag...
    The Havana Column Monument is summoning me:
    Defend the land embraced by my brothers with their lives!
    Li Baoli's heart is beating in my chest,
    Kang Jiale's blood is also boiling in my veins;
    Please take my heart to the ranks of the militia,
    The enemy of the machete is also the enemy of the red-tasseled spear!
    Give anger to fists
    On March 1st, the Panama Carnival parade passed through the Canal Zone occupied by the US military, hanging the Panamanian flag and distributing leaflets with "Yankees Go Home".
    This street is named Panama, this river is named Panama,
    Let the Panamanian flag fly high here!
    The red star symbolizes liberation, the blue star symbolizes freedom,
    The sixties are when your two stars shine brightly!
    Give hatred to fists, give anger to fists,
    Drive away the Americans, tear the flag of colonialism to shreds!
    Asia fights alongside you, Africa fights alongside you,
    Today! Working people everywhere are extending a helping hand to you...
    Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves
    On the eve of Eisenhower's visit to Latin America, residents of Puerto Rico living in the United States "saw him off." Holding signs with maps of the United States and Puerto Rico, a thick chain tightly locked Puerto Rico. …
    Looking at this chain of colonialism,
    I sing aloud the national anthem with sonorous syllables:
    "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves..."
    I want this war song to fly to Puerto Rico!
    I am immensely proud of my motherland,
    It was she who taught me this unforgettable song:
    "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves..."
    I will keep singing until you break free from the chains!

    ?The Cuban revolutionary government built a column monument in Havana to commemorate the immortal feats of the Chinese expatriates in the armed uprising against Spain. Inscribed on it: "Among the Chinese in Cuba, there is no deserter, no traitor."

    ?Li Baoli and Kang Jiale were both Chinese expatriates in the Cuban armed uprising forces against Spain. The former was praised by a Cuban president as "a model of patriotism and loyalty"; when the latter was seriously wounded and captured, he rebuked the enemy: "I am a lieutenant in the Cuban Liberation Army, kill me if you want!"

    ?The Panamanian flag consists of a red star and a blue star.

    把愤怒交给双拳
    珞珈
    我的心
    据古巴起义军机关报“绿色橄榄树报”报道：为了保卫古巴革命，将在“五一”劳动节前组织一百万民兵。
    我的父兄把头颅献给了这块土地，
    倒下去了还吻着血染的古巴国旗……
    哈瓦那的圆柱纪念碑在召唤着我：?
    保卫父兄们用生命拥抱过的土地！
    李宝力的心正在我的胸膛里跳跃，
    康家乐的血也沸腾在我的血管里；?
    请把我的心带到民兵的行列里吧，
    砍刀的仇敌也就是红缨枪的仇敌！
    把愤怒交给双拳
    3月1日，巴拿马庆祝狂欢节的游行队伍穿过了美军霸占的运河区，悬挂巴拿马国旗、散发“美国佬滚回去”的传单。
    这街道姓巴拿马，这河流姓巴拿马，
    让巴拿马的国旗在这儿高高地悬挂！
    红星象征着解放，蓝星象征着自由，
    六十年代，正是你双星高照的时候！?
    把仇恨交给双拳，把愤怒交给双拳，
    赶走美国佬，把殖民主义的旗帜撕个稀烂！
    亚洲和你并肩战斗，非洲和你并肩战斗，
    今天啊！到处的劳动人民都伸出了支援你的手……
    起来，不愿做奴隶的人们
    艾森豪威尔访问拉丁美洲前夕，居住在美国的波多黎各人为他“送行”。手里拿着标语牌，上面画着美国和波多黎各的地图，一条粗大的锁链紧锁着波多黎各。……
    望着这一条殖民主义的锁链，
    我大声唱着音节铿锵的国歌：
    “起来，不愿做奴隶的人们……”
    我要这只战歌飞往波多黎各！
    我为我的祖国感到无比骄傲，
    是她教会了我这支难忘的歌：
    “起来，不愿做奴隶的人们……”
    我要一直唱到你把锁链挣脱！
    ?古巴革命政府为了纪念中国侨民在反对西班牙的武装起义中的不朽功勋，在哈瓦那建立了一座圆柱纪念碑。上面铭刻着：“在古巴的中国人，没有一个是逃兵，没有一个是叛徒。”
    ?李宝力与康家乐均系古巴反对西班牙武装起义部队里的中国侨民。前者曾为一位古巴总统誉为“爱国主义和忠诚的典范”；后者伤重被俘时，怒斥敌人：“我是古巴解放军少尉，你们要杀就杀吧！”
    ?巴拿马国旗系由一红星与一蓝星组成。
