Hebei Mechanical System and Wuxi Diesel Engine Plant Issue Proposals to National Mechanical Workers
Rush-Produce Irrigation and Drainage Machinery　Launch Friendly Competitions
Hebei Guarantees Completion of the Year's Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Manufacturing Task in Half a Year
Wuxi Diesel Engine Plant Guarantees Completion of the First Quarter's Plan Half a Month Ahead of Schedule

    (This report) To support agriculture in fighting drought and ensure the sustained leap forward in agricultural production this year, the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Mechanical Industry and the Bureau of Agricultural Machinery have issued a proposal to the mechanical industry bureaus and agricultural machinery bureaus of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, calling for launching a competition to "vigorously rush-produce and repair irrigation and drainage machinery to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of this year's production tasks." Their specific goals are: to ensure that the year's irrigation and drainage machinery manufacturing task is completed in the first half of the year, and the task for the first half of the year is completed one month ahead of schedule. The annual tasks for agricultural irrigation and drainage electric motors, transformers, etc., are guaranteed to be completed before the end of May.

    The proposal states that in order to resolutely eliminate the spring drought, the workers on the mechanical industry front in the province have launched a mass movement to support agricultural drought resistance and ensure spring planting and summer harvest. The broad masses of workers have enthusiastically thrown themselves into this battle and have already achieved initial results. By the end of February, the province had completed more than 60,000 horsepower of agricultural irrigation and drainage power, more than 3,800 horsepower of agricultural irrigation and drainage motors, 6,800 kVA of transformers, and more than 7,000 agricultural water pumps. The entire repair task of agricultural irrigation and drainage power machinery is nearing completion. The broad masses of workers are determined to advance victoriously and resolutely guarantee the early, over-fulfillment, high-quality, and complete set completion of tasks; at the same time, they will ensure maintenance, installation, teaching, and use.

    Their measures are: First, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously promote mass movements, take supporting agricultural drought resistance as the current central task, concentrate forces, ensure key points, and guarantee that spring irrigation, spring plowing, and spring planting are not delayed. Second, vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution, focusing on the weak links in rushing to produce and repair irrigation and drainage machinery, vigorously engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization, and factories with conditions should advance towards automation and continuous operation to continuously improve labor productivity. At the same time, help rural areas vigorously promote the reform of various water lifting tools and give full play to the role of various water lifting tools. Third, vigorously promote collaboration and strengthen scheduling. Extensively carry out communist collaboration within and outside the province, organize all factories with the conditions to produce irrigation and drainage machinery, and closely cooperate with commercial, chemical, and other relevant departments to ensure the complete set and timely supply of machines, pumps, pipes, and belts. At the same time, strengthen production scheduling, strictly implement the inspection system, grasp production progress, and promptly schedule balance to ensure over-fulfillment of tasks. Fourth, overcome various difficulties and ensure the supply of raw materials: On the one hand, tightly grasp the organization and supply of materials for ordering irrigation and drainage machinery, and prioritize the use of existing raw materials that are suitable to support the production of irrigation and drainage machinery. On the other hand, adopt methods such as "production, tapping (tapping potential), substitution (substitution), finding (searching), and transformation (processing deformation)" to do everything possible to ensure production.

    (This report) In order to better support the rural drought resistance struggle and ensure a bumper summer harvest, the workers of the Wuxi Diesel Engine Plant have issued a proposal to brother factories in various provinces and cities to launch a friendly competition to "vigorously support agriculture and rush to produce agricultural irrigation and drainage power."

    In the proposal, they guarantee to complete 27,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage power in March, an increase of 23% compared to February. Complete the first quarter's production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, with an over-production of 34% horsepower for the entire quarter. At the same time, strengthen quality inspection to ensure the quality of machines; arrange for the production of spare parts to prevent machines from being shut down due to lack of spare parts. In the proposal, they also guarantee to strengthen service work in rural areas, expand the service team, help users repair machines according to needs, impart technology, train drivers, strengthen contact, and exchange advanced experiences in use and maintenance, so as to manage manufacturing, teaching, and use. They also guarantee to strengthen cooperation with railway transportation units, sign "one-dragon" contact contracts, and guarantee quick loading and quick transportation so that machines can be put into production in a timely manner.

    河北机械系统  无锡柴油机厂向全国机械职工发出倡议
    赶制排灌机械　开展友谊竞赛
    河北保证全年排灌机械制造任务半年完成
    无锡柴油机厂保证提前半月完成首季计划
    本报讯　为支援农业抗旱，保证今年农业生产的持续跃进，河北省机械工业局、农业机械局向全国各省、市、自治区机械工业厅（局）和农业机械厅（局）发出了掀起“大力赶制抢修排灌机械，保证提前和超额完成今年生产任务”的竞赛的倡议。他们的具体目标是：保证全年的排灌机械制造任务在上半年完成，上半年任务提前一个月完成。农业排灌电动机、变压器等全年任务保证在5月底以前完成。
    倡议书说，为了坚决消灭春旱，全省机械工业战线上的职工已经掀起了一个支援农业抗旱、保春播、保夏收的群众运动，广大职工个个热烈地投入了这场战斗，并已取得了初步成绩。到2月底，全省已完成农业排灌动力六万多马力，农业排灌电机三千八百多马力，变压器六千八百多千伏安，农用水泵七千多台。农业排灌动力机械的全部修理任务已接近完成。广大职工决心乘胜前进，坚决保证提前、超额和优质、成套地完成任务；同时做到保修、保装、保教、保用。
    他们的措施是：第一，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，把支援农业抗旱作为目前的中心任务，集中力量，确保重点，保证做到不误春灌春耕春播。第二，大搞技术革新和技术革命，围绕赶制和抢修排灌机械中的薄弱环节，大闹机械化半机械化，有条件的工厂并要向自动化、连续化进军，以不断提高劳动生产率。同时，帮助农村大搞各种提水工具的改革，充分发挥各种提水工具的作用。第三，大搞协作，加强调度，省内、省外广泛开展共产主义大协作，把有条件生产排灌机械的工厂全部组织起来，并和商业、化工等有关部门密切配合协作，确保机、泵、管、带成套和及时供应。同时，加强生产调度工作，严格检查制度，掌握生产进度，及时调度平衡，保证超额完成任务。第四，克服各种困难，保证原料材料供应：一方面抓紧排灌机械订货材料的组织供应，现有的各种原料材料只要合用的，就优先支援排灌机械的生产，一方面采取“产（生产）、挖（挖潜力）、代（代用）、找（寻找）、变（加工变形）”等方法，千方百计地保证生产。
    本报讯　无锡柴油机厂职工为了更好地支援农村的抗旱斗争，保证夏季大丰收，向各省、市兄弟工厂发出了开展“大力支援农业、赶制农业排灌动力”的友谊竞赛倡议。
