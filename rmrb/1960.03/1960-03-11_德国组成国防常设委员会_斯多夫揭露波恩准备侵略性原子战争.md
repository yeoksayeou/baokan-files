Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 10th. The Standing Committee on National Defense, under the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, was formed on the 9th. Paul Fröhlich, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, serves as the chairman of the committee.

The Standing Committee on National Defense was established by the tenth session of the People's Chamber held on February 10th. Gerald Goetting, Heinrich Homann, and Manfred Gerlach serve as vice-chairmen of the committee. Helmut Müller was elected as the committee's secretary.

At the meeting of the Standing Committee on National Defense held on the 9th, Minister of National Defense and Army General Stoph reported on the aggressive exercises conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under the name of "Winter Shield." After thorough discussion, the committee concluded that these exercises once again proved the correctness of the views recently put forward by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in his letter to Adenauer regarding the cessation of West German atomic armament; it also reconfirmed the facts repeatedly exposed by the People's Chamber and the government: Bonn is preparing for aggressive atomic war against the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia.

The meeting emphasized that the Bonn war-mongers, like the Hitler fascists of the past, are using words of peace to cover up their aggressive policies and are attempting to use deceptive propaganda to the people as an important prerequisite for realizing this aggressive plan.

They are not only using the same methods of war preparation, but also the same groups and the same gang who contributed to the preparation of World War II under the rule of the Hitler fascists.

The meeting pointed out that the Bonn war-mongers' plan threatening the survival of the German people must be told to the people, especially the people of West Germany, in order to stop the militarists.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 8th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement tonight on West Germany's preparations to establish military bases in foreign countries, especially in Spain, saying that all peace-loving people should be reminded that this action by the West German government once again proves that the German Democratic Republic's warnings about the aggressiveness and the danger of the policies of West German militarism are correct.

The statement, after refuting the claims made by some Western countries that it is possible to "supervise" West German armament and the claim by Bonn government officials that its "space is too narrow" to ensure West Germany's security, said that the West German government has long begun to establish a series of military bases in other countries, especially in Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Turkey, Italy, and others. Bonn's attempt to establish hegemony in Western Europe and the increasingly complete armament of West Germany are threatening European peace.

The statement said that for many years, the Adenauer government and the Spanish Franco regime have established political ties, and now, in addition to these political ties, they have supplemented them with military cooperation, which is the revival of the Hitler-Franco alliance. This proves that the West German ruling group is making all preparations to take military action alone at the appropriate time. The statement pointed out that there is no doubt that West Germany's allies will be dragged into a suicidal adventure.

The statement said that the West German government's measures to accelerate armament indicate that it opposes any international consultation and national understanding, especially the upcoming summit meeting. The statement concluded by saying that this line of the Bonn government once again illustrates the urgency of eliminating the remnants of World War II and eliminating the abnormal situation in West Berlin through the conclusion of a German peace treaty.

    德国组成国防常设委员会
    斯多夫揭露波恩准备侵略性原子战争
    德外交部声明指出西德军国主义复活威胁和平
    新华社柏林10日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院所属国防常设委员会已经在9日组成。德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员保罗·弗勒利希担任委员会主席。
    国防常设委员会是由2月10日召开的人民议院第十次会议决定成立的。担任这个委员会副主席的是格拉尔德·戈丁、海因里希·霍曼和曼弗雷德·格尔拉赫。赫尔穆特·缪勒当选为委员会秘书。
    在9日举行的国防常设委员会会议上，国防部长、陆军大将斯多夫就北大西洋公约组织以“冬防”为名进行侵略性演习问题作了报告。经过充分讨论后，委员会得出结论说，这种演习再一次证明，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希最近就停止西德原子武装等问题给阿登纳的信，所提出的看法是正确的；它也再一次证实了人民议院和政府屡次揭露的事实：波恩在对德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克进行侵略性的原子战争准备。
    会议着重指出，波恩战争贩子像过去希特勒法西斯一样，以和平的言词来掩盖他们的侵略政策，并且企图利用对人民的欺骗宣传来作为实现这个侵略计划的重要先决条件。
    他们不仅利用了同样的备战办法，而且还利用了同样的集团以及希特勒法西斯统治下对准备第二次世界大战出过力的那帮人。
    会议指出，必须把波恩战争贩子威胁德国人民生存的计划告诉人民，特别是西德人民，以便制止军国主义者。
    新华社柏林8日电　德意志民主共和国外交部今晚就西德准备在外国，特别是在西班牙建立军事基地一事发表声明说，应该提醒所有爱好和平的人们注意，西德政府的这一行动，再次证明，德意志民主共和国关于西德军国主义的侵略性及其政策的危险性的警告是正确的。
    声明在驳斥某些西方国家所说的有可能“监督”西德武装以及波恩政府人士所谓为了保障西德的安全，它的“空间太狭小”的说法之后说，西德政府早就着手在别国，特别是在挪威、丹麦、比利时、荷兰、法国、土耳其、意大利等国建立一系列的军事基地。波恩力图建立在西欧的霸权，正在日趋完备的西德的武装，威胁着欧洲和平。
    声明说，多年来，阿登纳政府和西班牙佛朗哥政权就建立了政治联系，现在，它们又在这种政治联系之外补充了军事上的合作，这是希特勒和佛朗哥同盟的复活。这证明，西德统治集团正在作一切准备，以便在适当时机采取军事上的单独行动。声明指出，不容怀疑的是，西德的盟国一定会被拖入自杀性的冒险中。
    声明说，西德政府加速武装的措施表明，它反对任何国际协商和民族谅解，特别是反对即将召开的最高级会议。声明最后说，波恩政府的这种路线，再一次说明，通过缔结对德和约来消除第二次世界大战的残迹和消除西柏林不正常局势的迫切性。
