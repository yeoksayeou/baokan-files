Thoughts After Reading Workers' Essays
    Yú Hǎi

    The above two essays were both written by worker comrades. (The two essays published on page 7 of the People's Daily on March 7 were also written by worker comrades.) It is a matter worth celebrating that workers are studying theory, writing articles, and authoring books.

    Throughout the country, a trend has begun to form in which the worker masses earnestly and enthusiastically study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Chairman Mao. The working class is the most advanced and most revolutionary class. In order to better transform the objective world and improve their ability to manage state affairs, they urgently demand to arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, raise their political awareness and ideological level, and better promote the continuous leap forward of socialist construction. This kind of study proceeds entirely from the actual needs of class struggle and production construction, serving the purpose of revolution.

    It is completely wrong if someone believes that the worker masses have a low level of education and cannot study theory. Theory is not that mysterious or unattainable. Please read these essays written by worker comrades to break this superstition. Originally, Marxist theory was the product of the workers' movement. The working people have rich experience in revolutionary struggle and production practice, and they are the most likely to master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the most complete embodiment of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific practice of our country's revolution. The worker masses have more favorable conditions for studying Mao Zedong Thought than intellectuals.

    The worker masses are best at using the method of closely integrating theory with practice when studying theory. They combine theoretical study with thought, with work, and with production, always treating Marxist-Leninist theory as a guide for their own thoughts and actions. Precisely because they use this method of study, many worker comrades, after studying Chairman Mao's works, are better at discovering contradictions and correctly resolving them in production and work, are good at correctly handling the relationship between the individual and the collective, the part and the whole, the advanced and the backward, and improve communist ideology, promote communist style, and do their work better.

    The worker masses studying theory is also a very important development in theoretical work. Further promoting this theoretical study movement is one of the important tasks at present.

    工人论文读后感
    于海
    上面这两篇论文，都是工人同志写的。（三月七日人民日报第七版所登载的两篇论文也是工人同志写的。）工人学理论、写文章、著书立说，是一件值得庆贺的事。
    工人群众认真地热情地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席著作，已经开始在全国各地形成风气。工人阶级是最先进、最革命的阶级。他们为了更好地改造客观世界，为了提高管理国家大事的本领，所以迫切要求用马克思列宁主义思想把自己武装起来，提高自己的政治觉悟和思想水平，更好地推动社会主义建设事业的持续跃进。这种学习，完全是从阶级斗争和生产建设的实际需要出发，为革命的目的服务。
    如果有人认为工人群众文化水平低，没法学理论，那是十分错误的。理论，并不是那样的神秘和高不可攀。请读一读这几篇工人同志写的论文，就可以破除这个迷信。本来，马克思主义的理论，就是工人运动的产物。劳动人民具有丰富的革命斗争和生产实践的经验，他们最容易掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义普遍真理与我国革命具体实践相结合的最完整的体现。工人群众学习毛泽东思想，有着比知识分子更加有利的条件。
    工人群众学习理论，最善于运用理论密切联系实际的学习方法。他们使理论学习和思想结合、和工作结合、和生产结合，时时刻刻把马克思列宁主义理论当作指导自己思想和行动的指南。正因为运用了这种学习方法，所以许多工人同志学习了毛主席的著作，在生产和工作中就更加善于发现矛盾和正确地解决矛盾，善于正确地处理个人和集体、局部和全部、先进和后进等关系，提高共产主义思想，发扬共产主义风格，把工作做得更好。
    工人群众学理论，这也是理论工作上的一个非常重要的发展。进一步推动这个理论学习运动，是当前重要工作之一。
