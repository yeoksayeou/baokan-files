Thought, Production, Life
    ——Written for the Launch of the Learning from Huang Fakun Movement in the Jingzhou Area
    Gong Tongwen

    Editor's Note:
    Huang Fakun, the Party Branch Secretary of the Shengli Production Team in the Yijiao Management District of the Linghe People's Commune, Jiangling County, Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, is a bright red banner in implementing the Party's mass line. Not long ago, the Jingzhou Sub-Team of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's Production and Livelihood Inspection Team and the Jingzhou Prefectural Party Committee jointly convened a broadcast meeting of over 200,000 cadres above the production team leader level and poor peasant representatives in the Jingzhou area, calling on cadres at all levels to learn from Huang Fakun's ideology, work style, and excellent qualities, and launching a movement to learn from Huang Fakun. Simultaneously with the broadcast meeting, the Jingzhou Prefectural Party Committee also issued a special notice instructing cadres throughout the area to study Huang Fakun's deeds and further strengthen the ties between cadres and the masses.

    How to boost morale, create a high tide, and improve production? Comrade Huang Fakun answered this question with his own experience: "Of all the thousands of ways, there are two essential ones: thought and livelihood." He also provided a vivid annotation to this answer: "When thought is hot, people are hot; when thought is cold, people are cold." "Without doing things yourself, you have no persuasive power." He used his exemplary actions to do ideological work, and he grasped production by grasping thought and livelihood.

    Seizing the season for transplanting rice seedlings – this is production. How did Comrade Huang Fakun grasp this production? To seize the season, we must quickly drain the waterlogged fields; to drain the waterlogged fields, we must quickly set up windmills. However, to set up windmills, there was no wood for the crossbeams and wind poles, and it was impossible to borrow or buy any. What to do? He dismantled his own house, using the roof beams as the windmill's crossbeams and wind poles. The windmill was set up, but the people watching the windmill were exposed to the sun and dew day and night. What to do? He simply moved his own dismantled house near the windmill and made it a work shed. The poor peasants sleeping in the work shed at night had no mosquito nets. What to do? He took out his own mosquito nets. The waterlogged fields were drained, but there were not enough seedlings. What to do? He took people to Nan Zhou to buy seedlings. On the road, some people had not brought dry rations. He gave them his own. As soon as they arrived at the fields, he jumped into the paddy fields and started pulling seedlings day and night. There was originally a danger of not seizing the season, but with his efforts, the season was seized. There was originally a danger of lacking seedlings, but with his efforts, there was no shortage of seedlings. The reason he was able to grasp such urgent tasks as seizing the season and ensuring enough seedlings so tightly and well was because his method was correct. He twisted thought, production, and livelihood into one rope to grasp them. As a result of this approach, the team he led—the Seventh Team of the Shengli Production Team in the Yijiao Management District of the Linghe People's Commune in Jiangling County—increased the unit area yield of rice from 550 jin in 1958 to 750 jin in 1959.

    After achieving a bumper harvest in a year of great disaster, a high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction was launched, and most of the labor force went to the water conservancy construction sites. Last December, around the 20th, when "the New Year" was approaching, Comrade Huang Fakun was still visiting other places and had not returned. At this time, some well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas took the opportunity to stir up the evil wind of disbanding the mess halls. On the one hand, they said how bad the mess halls were; on the other hand, they sold the mess halls' lotus roots and stole the mess halls' vegetables, making it so that everyone could not eat enough or eat well, affecting their work. If the mess halls were allowed to collapse like this, it would be terrible! Fortunately, Comrade Huang Fakun arrived in time. Braving the severe cold, he went into the water while sick and dug lotus roots for two days. He also personally cooked meals and prepared dishes. At the same time, he also did a lot of meticulous investigation and research. In this way, the conspiracy of the well-to-do middle peasants was exposed, the poor peasants were mobilized, and the mess halls were run well, and the commune members worked even harder. With this grasp, he comprehensively grasped thought, production, and livelihood.

    Comrade Huang Fakun's approach is very good! In terms of position, he was still a small team leader before February of this year; in terms of education level, he was not very literate. However, he has consistently and correctly resolved a major issue. That is, how should the relationship between thought, production, and livelihood be arranged? If it is arranged correctly, the work will be proactive; if it is not arranged correctly, it will be passive. And Comrade Huang Fakun has always maintained this initiative. Only those who share the fate and breathe the same air as the masses, who care about the masses at all times, and who have therefore taken root among the masses, can gain this initiative and can comprehensively grasp thought, production, and livelihood. Our work object is people, living people, each with their own thoughts, and each using their own thoughts to direct themselves. If we want the actions of the majority of people to obey the command of the leading organs, we must unify the thoughts of the majority of people. Without common thoughts, there will be no common actions, and of course there can be no large-scale production movement. Therefore, to grasp production, one must first grasp thought.

    Why develop production? Ultimately, it is to "maximally satisfy the constantly growing material and cultural needs of all members of society," that is, to improve livelihood. Workers do not work for the sake of working, but for the sake of improving livelihood. Farmers do not farm for the sake of farming, but for the sake of improving livelihood. Socialist-conscious workers and peasants participate in production not only to improve the livelihood of their families, but also to improve the livelihood of all members of society. If the lives of all those participating in production get worse and worse, there can be no large-scale production movement. Therefore, to grasp production, one must also grasp livelihood.

    How should the relationship between thought, production, and livelihood be arranged? The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong taught us, "We must pay attention to comprehensively grasping thought, grasping production, and grasping livelihood; we must care about people and correct the tendency of seeing things but not people." It is wrong to only grasp production and not grasp thought or livelihood, to confuse grasping production with grasping thought, and to believe that grasping production is grasping thought, and that production itself is a mass movement. It is also wrong to oppose production and livelihood, and to believe that paying attention to the lives of the masses will hinder production. Both of these errors are failures to "care about people" and "see things but not people."

    Comprehensively grasping thought, grasping production, and grasping livelihood is the hallmark of the mass viewpoint and the mass line, and it is also the task of the Party's leadership. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have driven the broad masses to invest in the great upsurge of socialist construction and have made them see a bright and splendid future, thus making them high-spirited, energetic, working without regard to remuneration, and working without conditions. Faced with such great masses, we should love them and care for them even more. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the lives of the masses; the more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be. The large-scale production movement that is currently being carried out in a booming manner is precisely the product of the combination of leadership and the masses, and it is precisely the product of comprehensively grasping thought, grasping production, and grasping livelihood.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Socialist factors are growing every day and every hour... A large number of intelligent, capable, fair, and active leaders have emerged from the masses." Comrade Huang Fakun is such a leader. He has withstood the test of victory, and he has also withstood the test of difficulties. In the face of victory, he took the lead in charging forward; in the face of difficulties, he also took the lead in charging forward. Difficulties always accompany victory, and difficulties are always interspersed in victory. In victory, it is impossible to avoid difficulties. Breaking through difficulties is a new victory. Comrade Huang Fakun demonstrated the heroic spirit of a firm proletarian revolutionary fighter in the face of difficulties, and therefore he has won the trust and love of the people. The people affectionately call him "Tuo Bo Zi" [translator's note: Tuo Bo Zi is a type of small tugboat], because he leads the people to ride the waves like a "Tuo Bo Zi," and because he carries heavy burdens and goes far like a "Tuo Bo Zi."

    The Shengli Production Team in the Yijiao Management District of the Linghe People's Commune in Jiangling County produced a Huang Fakun. Many counties, many communes, many management districts, and many production teams have their own "Huang Fakun." The Party comprehensively grasps thought, production, and livelihood through Huang Fakun-style leaders. Without a large number of such leaders, there is no way to realize the Party's leadership.

    The movement to learn from Huang Fakun is being launched in the Jingzhou area. Many cadres have compared their own words and actions with Huang Fakun's deeds and have examined themselves. Some said, "After listening to Comrade Huang Fakun's report, I only have two words: one is 'change,' and the other is 'catch up.'" Some said, "Compared with Comrade Huang Fakun, I feel that I am far behind. I swear not to be human if I don't catch up with Huang Fakun!" Through the movement to learn from Huang Fakun, more Huang Fakun-style leaders will emerge, and thought, production, and livelihood will be grasped even better. We hope that all localities will, like the Jingzhou Prefectural Party Committee, hold up their own Huang Fakuns as red flags!

    思想、生产、生活
    ——为荆州地区开展学习黄发坤运动而作
    龚同文
    编者按：
    中共湖北省荆州专区江陵县岭河人民公社丫角管理区胜利生产队支部书记黄发坤，是贯彻党的群众路线的一面鲜艳的红旗。不久前，中共湖北省委生产、生活检查团荆州分团和中共荆州地委，联合召开了荆州地区生产小队长以上干部和贫农代表二十多万人的广播大会，号召各级干部学习黄发坤的思想作风和优秀品质，开展了一个学习黄发坤的运动。在广播大会召开的同时，中共荆州地委还发出专门通知，指示全区干部学习黄发坤的事迹，进一步密切干部和群众的联系。
    如何鼓干劲，搞高潮，把生产搞得更好，黄发坤同志用自己的经验回答了这个问题：“千条万条，思想一条、生活一条。”他还为这个答案做了形象的注解：“思想是热的，人也是热的；思想是冷的，人也是冷的。”“做什么事不亲自动手就没有说服力。”他是用自己的模范行动来做思想工作的，他是通过抓思想、抓生活来抓生产的。
    抢季节插秧，这是生产。黄发坤同志怎么抓这个生产呢？要抢住季节，得赶紧排渍水，要排渍水，得赶紧架风车，可是，要架风车，没有做天梁和风杆的木料，借也借不到，买也买不到。怎么办？他就拆掉自己的房子，把屋梁做了风车的天梁和风杆。风车做起来了，看风车的人日晒夜露，怎么办？他干脆把自己的已经拆了的屋搬到风车附近做了工棚。晚上睡在工棚里看风车的贫农没有蚊帐，怎么办？他把自己的蚊帐拿出来。渍水排了，秧苗不够，怎么办？他带着人到南洲买秧，在路上，有的人没有带干粮。他把自己的干粮给了别人。一到地头，就跳下水田，不分日夜地扯起秧来。本来有抢不住季节的危险，他这一抓，抢住了季节。本来有缺秧苗的危险，他这一抓，秧苗不缺了。他之所以能够把抢季节、全秧苗这样万万火急的任务，抓的那么紧，抓的那么好，就是因为他的抓法对头。他是把思想、生产和生活扭成一股绳子去抓的。这样抓的结果，他所领导的小队——江陵县岭河人民公社丫角管理区胜利生产队第七小队，水稻的单位面积产量由1958年的五百五十斤提到1959年的七百五十斤。
    在大灾之年夺取了丰收之后，掀起了大办水利的高潮，大部分劳动力都到水利工地去了，去年腊月二十几，快“过年”了，黄发坤同志在外地参观，还没有回来，正在这个时候，一些资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，乘机兴起了解散食堂的妖风，一方面说食堂如何不好，另一方面卖食堂的藕，偷食堂的菜，弄得大家吃不饱，吃不好，影响干活。如果就这样让食堂垮下去，那还得了！幸好黄发坤同志赶来了，他冒着严寒，带病下水，连挖了两天藕，又亲自下厨做饭做菜，同时，还做了许多细致的调查研究工作。这样，把富裕中农的阴谋戳穿了，把贫农发动起来了，把食堂办好了，社员们干活更起劲了。他这一抓，又把思想、生产、生活全面地抓起来了。
    黄发坤同志的抓法好得很！论职位，他在今年2月以前，还是一个小队长；论文化水平，他识字不多，可是，他却一贯正确地解决了一个重大问题。这就是思想、生产、生活这三个方面的关系怎么摆法？摆对了，工作就主动，摆不对，就被动。而黄发坤同志一直是掌握了这种主动权的。只有和群众共命运、同呼吸，时时刻刻关心群众，因而在群众当中生了根的人，才能够取得这种主动权，才能够把思想、生产、生活全面地抓起来。我们的工作对象是人，是活人，各有各的思想，各人用自己的思想指挥自己。如果要大多数人的行动听从领导机关的指挥，这就一定要把大多数人的思想统一起来。没有共同的思想，也就没有共同的行动，当然也就不可能有大规模的生产运动。因此，要抓生产，首先非抓思想不可。
    为什么要发展生产？归根结底，是为了“最大限度地满足全体社会成员经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要”，也就是为了搞好生活。工人不是为做工而做工，是为搞好生活而做工。农民不是为种田而种田，是为搞好生活而种田。有社会主义觉悟的工人、农民，不仅是为了搞好一家人的生活而参加生产，而且是为了搞好全体社会成员的生活而搞好生产。如果所有参加生产的人，生活越来越不好，也就不可能有大规模的生产运动。因此，要抓生产，同时非抓生活不可。
    思想、生产、生活这三个方面的关系，到底怎么摆法？党中央和毛泽东同志教导我们，“必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，必须关心人，纠正那种见物不见人的倾向”。只抓生产，不抓思想，不抓生活，把抓生产和抓思想混为一谈，认为抓生产就是抓思想，认为生产本身就是群众运动的观点，是错误的。把生产和生活对立起来，认为重视群众生活，就会妨碍生产的观点，也是错误的。这两个方面的错误，都是不“关心人”，都是“见物不见人”。
    全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，是群众观点和群众路线的标志，也是党的领导任务。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，推动广大群众投入伟大的社会主义建设高潮，并且使他们看到了光辉灿烂的前途，因而意气风发，干劲冲天，工作不计报酬，劳动不讲条件，我们面对这样伟大的群众，应当更加热爱他们，关心他们。群众的干劲越大，党越是要关心群众的生活；党越是关心群众的生活，群众的干劲就会越大。目前正在轰轰烈烈地开展的大规模生产运动，正是领导和群众相结合的产物，正是全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活的产物。
    毛泽东同志说，“社会主义因素每日每时都在增长……群众中涌现出了大批的聪明能干公道积极的领袖人物。”黄发坤同志就是这样的领袖人物。他经受了胜利的考验，也经受了困难的考验。在胜利面前，他带头打冲锋，在困难面前，他也是带头打冲锋。困难总是伴随着胜利一起来的，困难总是夹在胜利中间的。在胜利中，不可能避免困难，冲破了困难，就是新的胜利。黄发坤同志在困难面前表现了坚定的无产阶级革命战士的英雄气概，因而他得到了人民群众的信任和爱戴。人民群众亲切地称呼他为“拖驳子”，这是因为他像“拖驳子”一样地带动了人民群众乘风破浪，这是因为他像“拖驳子”一样地任重而致远。
    江陵县岭河人民公社丫角管理区胜利生产队出了一个黄发坤，许多县，许多公社，许多管理区，许多生产队，都有自己的“黄发坤”，党就是通过黄发坤式的领袖人物去全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活的，没有大批的这样的领袖人物，就没有办法实现党的领导。
    学习黄发坤运动，正在荆州地区开展起来。许多干部对照黄发坤的事迹，检查了自己的言论和行动。有的说，我听了黄发坤同志的报告，回去以后只有两个字，一个是“改”，一个是“赶”。有的说，跟黄发坤同志一比，觉得自己差远了，不赶上黄发坤，誓不为人！通过学习黄发坤运动，将会涌现更多的黄发坤式的领袖人物来，将会把思想、生产、生活抓的更好。我们希望各地也像荆州地委一样，把自己的黄发坤当做红旗高高举起来！
