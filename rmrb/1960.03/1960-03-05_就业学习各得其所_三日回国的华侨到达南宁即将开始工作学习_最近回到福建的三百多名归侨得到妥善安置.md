Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 4th: The more than 1,600 overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland from Indonesia on the 3rd arrived in Nanning today from Zhanjiang on two trains at 3:40 PM and 4:20 PM, respectively, and were warmly welcomed and cordially received by more than 3,000 people from all ethnic groups in Nanning City.

Huang Changshui, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Wang Yuanxing, member of the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese; Lu Shaowu, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; and Pan Qingqi and Ma Nan, Vice Chairmen of the Guangxi Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, arrived in Nanning together with the returned overseas Chinese.

Today, from the platform to the square in front of the Nanning Railway Station, and all the way to the reception center, the street entrances were decorated with many banners with slogans such as: "Warmly welcome overseas Chinese to return to the warm embrace of the motherland," "Warmly welcome overseas Chinese to return to the motherland to participate in socialist construction," and "Extend cordial greetings to the persecuted overseas Chinese in Indonesia." As the train slowly pulled into Nanning Station, thunderous applause, cheers, firecrackers, gongs, drums, and Sheng (a Chinese wind instrument) and flute sounds rang out at the station, as people of all ethnic groups warmly welcomed their relatives who had finally returned to the embrace of the motherland after experiencing hardships and difficulties.

After the train came to a stop, the welcoming masses standing in the front row rushed forward to carry luggage for their relatives and helped the elderly and frail overseas Chinese off the carriages. At this time, Mo Naiqun, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, Yan Guangcai, Secretary of the Nanning Municipal Party Committee and Mayor, and other party and government leaders shook hands and greeted the overseas Chinese.

After the returned overseas Chinese arrived, a welcome meeting was held in the square in front of the railway station. At the meeting, Deng Kun and other overseas chinese representatives expressed their deep gratitude for the meticulous care of the motherland. He represented all the returned overseas Chinese in expressing that they will definitely work hard and study well in the future, and contribute to socialist construction together with the people of the whole country.

After the meeting, the returned overseas Chinese took public buses to the reception center to rest.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 4th: The more than 1,600 returned overseas Chinese who returned to Zhanjiang City from Indonesia on the "Russia" and "Yakutia" ships on the 3rd have already left by train for Nanning, Guangxi this morning, where they will be settled in various parts of Guangxi for work or study.

The people of Zhanjiang City got up before dawn today and went to the station with gongs and drums to see off the returned overseas Chinese. Mo Huai, Secretary of the Zhanjiang Prefectural Party Committee and Commissioner of the Zhanjiang Special District, and Director of the Reception and Settlement Office for Returned Overseas Chinese, as well as local relevant officials, also went to the station to see them off.

During their stay in Zhanjiang, Tian Xin, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province, visited them at their residence.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 4th: More than 300 returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students from Indonesia who have returned to Fujian Province in succession over the past two months or so have been properly settled according to the needs of the country and their personal wishes, and have embarked on productive or learning posts.

When the returned overseas Chinese returned to Fujian in batches and took up production and study posts, they were warmly welcomed and received by the local people and government. The state has provided essential clothing to returned overseas Chinese who have encountered difficulties in life due to the interception of private property by powerful groups in Indonesia. Huang Xingbang and other Indonesian returned overseas Chinese students who went to study at the Jimei Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Middle School Remedial School, who had financial difficulties, were given scholarships by the school. Returned overseas Chinese students who did not have cold-weather equipment received quilts issued by the school. Hu Bishun, a returned overseas Chinese settled in the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm, said excitedly after receiving cotton clothes and sanitary clothes for his entire family of ten from the state: "Although it is winter now, it is warmer than spring."

After arriving at their new posts, the returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students enthusiastically and vigorously participated in labor and study. More than 130 returned overseas Chinese who have been settled in the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm have all participated in work within their capabilities based on their labor ability, technology, and wishes. Some went to the farm's production team to engage in tropical and subtropical crop production and management, and some went to the farm's woodworking factory, repair shop, mechanic team, and sewing group to participate in production labor. Yu Shun, who had been a carpenter for more than 20 years overseas, enthusiastically worked with old farm members as soon as he arrived at the woodworking factory. He said, "I want to work hard with you to build new houses so that the new returned overseas Chinese who come later can live in new houses." Huang Yalang, Lin Yufeng and others, who did not have jobs in Indonesia, said happily after participating in the work of the sewing group: "The motherland is so good! There are canteens and nurseries, and there is work to do everywhere. We women are truly liberated." The 170 returned overseas Chinese students who went to study at the Jimei Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Middle School Remedial School have also begun a happy learning life. When they arrived at the school in batches, the school leaders immediately arranged classes according to their original levels and assigned special teachers to tutor them in remedial courses.

    今天，南宁车站从月台到站前的广场上，直到接待所，沿途街道口装挂着许多横幅，上面写着：“热烈欢迎侨胞回到祖国温暖的怀抱”、“热烈欢迎侨胞回祖国参加社会主义建设”、“向印度尼西亚受迫害的侨胞致以亲切的慰问”。当列车徐徐驶进南宁车站时，车站上雷鸣般的掌声、欢呼声、炮竹声、锣鼓声、笙笛声响成一片，各族人民热烈欢迎历尽艰难困苦终于回到祖国怀抱的亲人们。
    车停稳后，站在最前列的欢迎群众都争上前去为亲人们搬行李，扶着年老体弱的侨胞走下车厢。这时，自治区副主席莫乃群、中共南宁市委书记、市长阎光彩等党政负责人同侨胞们握手问好。
    当归侨到达后，在火车站前面的广场上举行了欢迎大会。会上，归侨邓昆和代表一千六百多名归侨，对祖国无微不至的关怀表示深切的感谢。他代表全体归侨表示今后一定好好工作、学习，同全国人民一道，为社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。

    归侨们在分批回到福建和走上生产、学习岗位时，都受到当地人民和政府的热情欢迎和接待。因印度尼西亚有势力集团截留私人财物生活发生困难的归侨，国家都发给他们必需的衣物。到集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习的印度尼西亚归侨学生黄兴邦等，经济有困难，学校发给助学金。没有御寒设备的归国华侨学生都领到了学校发给的棉被。安置在常山华侨农场的归侨胡必顺，在收到国家发给他全家老少十人的棉衣和卫生衣后，激动地说：“现在虽然是冬天，但却比春天还温暖。”
    归国华侨和归国华侨学生到新的岗位后，都热情奋发地参加劳动和学习。先后安置在常山华侨农场的一百三十多名归侨，都已根据他们的劳动能力、技术和志愿，参加了他们力所能及的工作。有的到农场生产队从事热带和亚热带作物生产和管理工作，有的到农场的木工厂、修配厂、机工队和缝纫组参加生产劳动。在海外当了二十多年老木工的余顺，一到木工厂就热情地同老场员们一起劳动，他说：“我要和你们共同努力把新房屋盖好，让以后来的新归侨都住上新房子。”在印度尼西亚时没有工作的归侨黄亚郎、林玉凤等，在参加缝纫组工作后，欢喜地说：“祖国多好啊！有食堂、托儿所，到处有工作做，我们妇女真的解放了。”到集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习的一百七十名归国华侨学生，也都开始了愉快的学习生活。当他们分批到达这个学校时，学校领导上即按照他们原来的程度编班，并指定专门教师辅导他们补习功课。
