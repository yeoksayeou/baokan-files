    At Least Five Mu of Rice Seedlings Transplanted a Day
    Zang Ze'wo, Hubei Xinzhou County Agricultural Bureau
    Hearing that a rice transplanter was to be tested,
    Old Bao'an shook his head unconvinced:
   “Since ancient times, transplanting rice means facing the mud,
    If not, I’ll concede to you!”
    Before the squad leader could shout "Start,"
    Rows of seedlings were already planted in the field,
    The surrounding crowd laughed in the field,
    Happily singing a tune of harvest!
    Gui Mei suppressed her laughter and called to Uncle Bao'an,
    He pretended to be deaf and turned his head away.
   “Uncle Bao'an, if you're not convinced, let's have a contest,
    Let's see if I can transplant at least five mu a day!”

    一天最少插五亩
    湖北新洲县农业局　臧泽渥
    听说要试插秧机，
    老保安摇头不服气：
   “自古插秧脸朝泥，
    要不把头输给你！”
    小队长还没喊“开始”，
    一行行秧苗插田里，
    四围的人群一田笑，
    乐的像是唱丰收调！
    桂梅忍笑喊保安伯，
    他装聋把头往一边扭。
   “保安伯，不服咱来比比武，
    看我一天最少插五亩！”
