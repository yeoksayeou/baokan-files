Experiences in Doing Investigative Research Work
Li Zhiming, Secretary of the CPC Hebei Hengshui County Committee

Using the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method of thinking to conduct investigative research work allows one to correctly reflect objectivity, discover contradictions, and resolve contradictions. It is a huge driving force in promoting the victorious and continuous advancement of socialist construction.

In Hengshui County, which was once known as an area with low agricultural production and no foundation for industrial production, a leap in industrial and agricultural production was achieved in 1958. Especially since 1959, under the correct leadership of the Party, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we have conducted in-depth investigative research work with the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method of thinking, discovered the main contradictions, solved the key to the work, and promoted the comprehensive and great development of various construction undertakings. The total industrial output value increased by 180% compared with 1958, laying the foundation for mechanization and semi-mechanization. In agriculture, it changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus-grain county, changing the entire county's face.

In doing investigative research work, standpoint is fundamental. The proletarian and bourgeois standpoints in investigative research work reflect two lines, two classes, and two ideologies. Due to the different interests represented by each class, the objects relied upon after going down to the grassroots are also different. Relying on poor peasants versus relying on landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants will naturally lead to two different results. For example, the grain policy is recognized by the broad masses of working people as a life-saving policy, while those hostile elements try every means to destroy and attack the grain policy by buying less and selling more. This is determined by their anti-socialist class standpoint. As people say: what kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of seed grows what kind of seedling, what class speaks what kind of words. If a proletarian revolutionary does not have a clear class standpoint in investigation work, he will lose his direction and deny the objectivity of things, inevitably making one-sided and untrue conclusions about objective things. Therefore, in investigative research work, we must first firmly stand on the proletarian standpoint, analyze problems and study problems from phenomenon to essence. Any neglect will lead to one-sided judgments, which is very dangerous.

In research work, viewpoint is the reflection of judging and understanding the objective world. Only with a firm proletarian standpoint and a proletarian viewpoint can we see the mainstream, perceive contradictions, truthfully reflect the objective world, give full play to people's subjective initiative, and enhance the confidence and determination to continuously revolutionize. In order to strengthen the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint, we must strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought, pay attention to politics at all times, conscientiously study the Party's actual work and experience, enhance the sense of responsibility for actual work, and resolutely observe and analyze problems comprehensively from the overall interests of the Party; we must resolutely abandon all kinds of bourgeois ideological influences and establish a strong proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method of thinking for analyzing and researching investigation problems.

The work style of investigative research is the key to specifically reflecting and understanding problems, discovering contradictions, and resolving contradictions. Only by being specific and in-depth, down-to-earth, believing in the Party, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, relying on workers and poor peasants, being good at analyzing the situation, and distinguishing right from wrong; both enthusiastically encouraging vigor and supporting new things, and advocating scientific analysis and seeking truth from facts, is this the method of conducting investigative research work with the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint. Some comrades are not good at going deep into reality and approaching the masses, they like to take a cursory look, or even hear things second-hand and echo what others say, so the problems they reflect are also subjective and one-sided, and even attempt to subjectively transform the objective, becoming empiricist egoists.

In 1959, the CPC Hengshui County Committee, in order to summarize the experience of investigative research work, adopted a series of measures such as industrial secretaries going to factories to the workshops, finance and trade secretaries working as salespersons, county party secretaries working as secretaries in communes, county party committee members working as management district secretaries, and department heads going down to become commune members to experience life and sum up experiences. Eighteen county party committee members went deep into the communes, districts, and teams to specifically experience life and sum up experiences. The second secretary of the county party committee went deep into Xiaozhai Commune to serve as the first secretary. After investigation and research, he summarized the "four togethers" (eating, living, laboring, and studying together with grassroots cadres and commune members) and "four commons" (common inspection, common research, common execution, and common responsibility) adapting to the new situation, established the advanced banner of the Dongxing Team, and launched a learn-from, catch-up-with, and surpass movement. In July 1959 alone, more than 300 major experiences were disseminated and promoted throughout the county, more than 80 on-site meetings of various kinds were held, and more than 13,600 pacesetters and models were established, which not only greatly encouraged the soaring enthusiasm of nearly one million people in the county and seized the great victory of industrial, agricultural production and various construction undertakings in 1959, but also created a wealth of experience for the continued leap forward this year. This is the flower bloomed and the fruit borne by grasping Mao Zedong Thought and using the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method of thinking to conduct investigative research work.

    做调查研究工作的体会
    中共河北衡水县委书记处书记  李志明
    用无产阶级的立场观点和思想方法作调查研究工作，就能正确的反映客观、发现矛盾、解决矛盾。它是推动社会主义各项建设事业胜利再胜利、前进再前进的巨大动力。
    在一向被称为农业低产区、工业生产没有基础的衡水县，1958年取得了工农业生产的飞跃发展。特别是1959年以来，在党的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，以无产阶级的立场观点和思想方法，进行了深入的调查研究工作，发现了主要矛盾，解决了工作关键，推动了各项建设事业全面大发展。工业总产值比1958年增长了180％，奠定了机械化、半机械化的基础，在农业上由缺粮县一跃而为余粮县，改变了全县面貌。
    作调查研究工作，立场是根本。无产阶级和资产阶级在调查研究工作中的立场，有着两条路线、两个阶级、两种思想的反映。由于各代表阶级利益的不同，因而下去后依靠的对象也就不同，依靠贫农与依靠地主、富农、富裕中农当然会得出两种不同的结果。例如，粮食政策被广大劳动人民公认为救命政策，而那些敌对分子却千方百计地以少购多销破坏攻击粮食政策。这是由于他们反社会主义的阶级立场所决定的。正如人们说的：什么藤结什么瓜，什么树开什么花，什么种长什么苗，什么阶级说什么话。无产阶级革命者，在调查工作中，如没有明确的阶级立场，将迷失方向，否认事物的客观性，势必对客观事物作出片面的、不真实的结论。因此，在调查研究工作中，首先要站稳无产阶级立场，从现象到本质，分析问题，研究问题，任何偏废，都将作出片面的判断，那是非常危险的。
    在研究工作中，观点是判断和认识客观世界的反映。既要有坚定的无产阶级立场，又要有无产阶级的观点，才能看清主流，察觉矛盾，真实的反映客观世界，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，增强不断革命的信心与决心。为了坚定无产阶级的立场观点，我们就必须加强毛泽东思想的学习，时刻关心政治，认真研究党的实际工作和经验，增强对实际工作的责任感，坚决从党的全局利益出发去全面的观察问题，分析问题；必须坚决摒弃各式各样的资产阶级思想影响，树立起坚强的无产阶级立场、观点和分析研究调查问题的思想方法。
    调查研究的工作作风问题，是具体反映和认识问题、发现矛盾、解决矛盾的关键。只有具体深入，踏踏实实，相信党，相信群众，依靠群众，依靠工人、贫农，善于分析形势，辨别是非；既热情地鼓舞干劲，支持新鲜事物，又要提倡科学分析和实事求是，这是用无产阶级立场观点调查研究工作的方法。有个别同志不善于深入实际和接近群众，喜欢走马观花，甚至道听途说，人云亦云，因此他反映的问题也是主观、片面，甚至企图主观改造客观，成为经验主义唯我主义者了。
    1959年，中共衡水县委为了总结调查研究工作的经验，采取了工业书记下厂到车间，财贸书记当售货员，县委书记到公社当书记，县委委员当管理区书记，部长下放当社员等一系列的措施，十八名县委委员深入到社、区、队具体体验生活，总结经验。县委第二书记深入到小寨公社当第一书记，经过调查研究，总结了适应新形势的四同（与基层干部和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习）、四共同（共同检查、共同研究、共同执行、共同负责），树立了东兴队的先进旗帜，展开了学、赶、超的运动。仅仅在1959年7月份后，全县就传播推广了较大的经验三百余条，召开各种各样的现场会八十余次，树起标兵模范一万三千六百多名，不仅大大鼓舞了全县近百万人民的冲天干劲，夺取了1959年工、农业生产及各项建设事业的巨大胜利，并且为今年继续跃进创造了丰富的经验。这就是掌握毛泽东思想、运用无产阶级立场观点和思想方法进行调查研究工作所开的花，结的果。
