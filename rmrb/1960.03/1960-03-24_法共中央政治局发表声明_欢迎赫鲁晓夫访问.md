Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 22nd: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement today welcoming the visit of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, to France.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union, today as at the beginning of its founding, resolutely struggles to defend peace. Khrushchev, on behalf of the Soviet Union, proposed a comprehensive disarmament proposal at the United Nations. Accepting this proposal would mean that humanity's material wealth could be used for peaceful endeavors.

The statement said: "The French people remember the enormous sacrifices made by the Soviets in the common war against Hitler. They know that when the soldiers of Stalingrad crushed the Nazi army on the banks of the Volga, they were also fighting for the freedom of the world, for the revival of enslaved France." The statement emphasized: "People still have vivid memories of the disasters of the Second World War. At a time when the remnants of Hitlerism and militarism are revived in West Germany, the people of France and the Soviet Union must understand each other, cooperate with each other, and work together to defend peace."

The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor also issued a statement tonight welcoming Khrushchev's visit.

    法共中央政治局发表声明
    欢迎赫鲁晓夫访问
    据新华社巴黎22日电　法国共产党中央委员会政治局今天发表声明，欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫来法国访问。
    声明指出，苏联今天像建国之初一样，坚决地为保卫和平而斗争。赫鲁晓夫曾代表苏联在联合国提出了全面裁军的建议，接受这个建议将意味着能把人类的物质财富用于和平事业。
    声明说：“法国人记得，苏联人在反对希特勒的共同战争中作出了巨大的牺牲。他们知道，当斯大林格勒的战士在伏尔加河边粉碎纳粹军队的时候，他们也是在为全世界的自由而战，为遭受奴役的法国的复兴而战。”声明强调指出：“人们对第二次世界大战的灾祸记忆犹新。当此希特勒主义的余孽和军国主义在西德复活的时候，法国和苏联两国人民必须互相谅解，互相协作，共同努力来保卫和平。”
    法国总工会执行局今晚也发表声明欢迎赫鲁晓夫来访。
