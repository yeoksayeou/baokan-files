Let Art Better Fulfill Its Educational Mission
Czechoslovak Film Art Symposium Held

    (本报讯　布拉格消息：2月22日到27日，在比尔森举行了捷克斯洛伐克第二届电影节。电影节前夕，捷克斯洛伐克的电影艺术工作者举行了一次讨论电影艺术的座谈会。2月14日“红色权利报”登载了这次座谈会的记录。)
    (Our dispatch from Prague) The second Czechoslovak Film Festival was held in Pilsen from February 22nd to 27th. On the eve of the film festival, Czechoslovak film artists held a symposium to discuss film art. The "Red Right Daily" published a record of the symposium on February 14th.

    At the symposium, Comrade Ai. Hoffman, director of the Barrandov Film Studio, emphasized the achievements. He said: "Most of the creative staff are treating their work with a high sense of responsibility. In terms of script editing, efforts are being concentrated on finding materials devoted to depicting the real situation of modern people."

    Ai. Hoffman listed some subjects that, although not yet up to the ideological requirements, attempted to focus on the relationship between factories and rural areas, and modern people. "Especially the artists who create these things, they strive to familiarize themselves as much as possible with the issues, people, environment, and places depicted in the films during the script writing and film preparation stages. They strive to prevent the film from being perceived as pure imagination, but rather as coming from observations of life. The leaders in the film industry are doing their best to support this effort. This is one of the keys to improving and resolving our current situation. Of course, this is also related to another issue, namely the level of ideological maturity. It is not enough to simply understand life -- what is important depends on what one sees in life, and on how one can reasonably process one's understanding in the correct way. Therefore, we are taking a series of measures to improve ideological levels."

    Bu. Gu’enz, the chief editor of the creative group, said: "I feel more and more strongly that it is not enough to just let writers get close to life. Some ideologically immature people may even clash with the reality of life, come to incorrect conclusions, and fall into naturalism. Today, we must do more work in arming playwrights ideologically."

    Comrade Yang. Kestelong from the Czechoslovak Kuerben-Daniek Factory in Stalingrad stressed that the Party's requirement is for art to fully fulfill its educational mission. "We don't want films to only depict things that are superficially interesting, nor do we want films to only express techniques. Artists cannot simply copy superficial things. The reason it is called art is that it is good at transforming the reality of life into the truth of art, and 'decocting' the sum of events in life into a 'soup' that is correct and genuine."

    At the symposium, it was pointed out that it is not enough to just connect with people through symposiums. Attention must be paid to the fact that film artists not only get to know people when they are discussing with them, but also get to know them in the future by living and eating with them. "Not only follow the working class, but must live with the working class." This is Bu. Gu’enz's view on this issue.

    让艺术更好地完成教育使命
    捷举行电影艺术座谈会
    本报讯　布拉格消息：2月22日到27日，在比尔森举行了捷克斯洛伐克第二届电影节。电影节前夕，捷克斯洛伐克的电影艺术工作者举行了一次讨论电影艺术的座谈会。2月14日“红色权利报”登载了这次座谈会的记录。
    在座谈会上，巴兰道夫电影制片厂厂长爱·霍夫曼同志强调指出了成绩的一方面。他说：“大部分创作人员都是以高度的责任感来对待工作的。在剧本编辑方面，正在集中力量寻找致力于描写现代人的真实情况的材料。”
    爱·霍夫曼列举了一些虽则还没有达到思想要求水平、然而却是试图重点表现工厂与农村以及现代人之间的关系等问题的题材。“特别是创作这些东西的艺术家们，他们在编写剧本和影片筹备拍摄阶段努力争取最大限度地熟悉那些问题、人们和环境以及影片所描写的地方的情况，他们努力使影片不致于被人感觉到是凭空想像出来的，而是出自于对生活的观察。电影方面的领导者对于这种努力是尽力支持的。这就是改善和解决我国目前情况的关键之一。当然，这也是与另外的、即思想的成熟程度问题相联系的。仅仅懂得生活是不够的——重要的是，取决于人在生活中之所见，取决于怎样合理地把自己的认识以正确的方式来进行加工整理。因此，我们采取一系列的措施来提高思想水平。”
    创作组主任编辑布·固恩茨说：“我越来越强烈地感觉到，仅仅让作家接近生活还是不够的。某些思想不成熟的人甚至还会与生活的现实性发生冲突，得出不正确的见解，陷入自然主义之中。今天在剧作家的思想武装方面，我们必须还要作更多的工作。”
    斯大林格勒捷克斯洛伐克郭尔本—达聂克工厂扬·柯斯特隆同志强调指出，党的要求是让艺术充分地完成自己的教育使命。“我们不希望电影只是描写那些表面上很有趣的东西，也不希望电影仅仅是表现技巧。艺术家不能仅仅是把表面的东西抄录下来。所以称之谓艺术，就在于它善于把生活的真实性变为艺术的真实性，把生活中事件的总和‘熬煎’成结果是正确的、真正的‘汤汁’。”
    在座谈会上，有人指出，仅仅以座谈会的方式来与人们联系还是不够的，必须注意到，电影艺术家不仅仅是在与人们进行讨论的时候去认识他们，而且要在将来与他们同吃同住的生活中去了解他们。“不仅只是跟着工人阶级走，而且必须与工人阶级共同生活。”这是布·固恩茨对这个问题的看法。
