Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 27th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated today at a press conference in Kyoto that, regardless of the strong opposition of the Japanese people, he will force the Diet to quickly approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Kishi said that he hopes the House of Representatives can approve the new "Security Treaty" around April 20th. He said, "It is already behind the planned schedule," and "Right now, my mind is filled with the matter of getting the new Security Treaty approved."

Kishi also said that he will consider reorganizing the cabinet after the Diet approves the new "Security Treaty," but regarding whether he will run for a third term as President of the Liberal Democratic Party, he has "not yet considered" it.

Japanese newspapers revealed that Kishi is releasing information such as "reorganizing the cabinet" and "no longer running for President of the Liberal Democratic Party" after the new "Security Treaty" is approved, plotting to divide the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party, attempting to use this as "bait" to gain their support for the approval of the new "Security Treaty."

    不顾日本人民的强烈反对
    岸信介要强使国会批准日美军事条约
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在京都的记者招待会上，表示他不顾日本人民的强烈反对，要强使国会迅速批准新日美“安全条约”。
    岸信介说，他希望众议院能在4月20日左右批准新“安全条约”。他说“目前已经比预定的计划推迟了”，“现在我的头脑里装满了使新安全条约获得批准这件事情”。
    岸信介还说他将在国会批准新“安全条约”后考虑改组内阁，而关于他是否竞选第三届自由民主党总裁一事，现在“还没有考虑”。
    日本报刊透露，岸信介正放出在批准新“安全条约”后“改组内阁”和“不再竞选自由民主党总裁”等空气，阴谋分化自由民主党内“反主流派”，企图以此为“饵”来换取他们对批准新“安全条约”的支持。
