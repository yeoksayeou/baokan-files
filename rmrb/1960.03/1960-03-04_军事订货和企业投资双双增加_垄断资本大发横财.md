    Military Orders and Corporate Investment Both Increase
    Monopoly Capital Amasses Wealth
    The Nobusuke Kishi government, colluding with U.S. imperialism to implement policies of military expansion and war preparations, continues to bring huge profits to Japanese monopoly capital.
    According to official Japanese materials, last year the profits of large Japanese corporations increased by 16.8%. Metallurgy companies increased their average income by 60% compared to 1958, and textile companies doubled their income.
    This year, the Japanese government has also decided to allocate 594.1 billion yen, squeezed from the laboring people through taxation, as investments in public corporations and monopoly capital enterprises. In addition, Japan's monopoly enterprises will obtain even greater benefits from the government's massive military orders.

    军事订货和企业投资双双增加
    垄断资本大发横财
    岸信介政府勾结美帝国主义实行扩军备战政策，给日本垄断资本继续带来巨额利润。
    据日本官方的材料，去年日本大公司的利润增加了16．8％，冶金公司比1958年平均增加收入60％，纺织公司的收入增加一倍。
    今年，日本政府还决定把从劳动人民身上榨来的税款，拨出五千九百四十一亿日元，作为对公营企业和垄断资本企业的投资。此外，日本的垄断企业还将从政府的庞大军事订货中取得更大的好处。
