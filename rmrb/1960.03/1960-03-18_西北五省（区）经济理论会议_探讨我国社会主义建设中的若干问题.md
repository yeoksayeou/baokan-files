    Northwest Five Provinces (Regions) Economic Theory Conference
    Discusses Several Issues in China's Socialist Construction

    The second issue of the "Economic Research" magazine in 1960 introduced the situation of the economic theory discussion meeting in the Northwest Five Provinces (Regions). The main points of the several major issues discussed at the meeting are introduced as follows:

    The Issue of High-Speed Development and Comprehensive Balance of the National Economy

    (1) Regarding the high-speed development of the national economy: Most people believe that high-speed development is the inevitable result of the effect of various socialist economic laws, and it is an inherent inevitable trend in socialist economic development. Therefore, it is governed by laws, but it is not an independent economic law. Some comrades believe that high-speed development is an independent economic law, which is determined by the socialist public ownership of the means of production and is confirmed by the fact that the national economies of socialist countries are developing at high speed.

    Everyone believes that the trend of China's national economic development is a sustained leap forward. This trend of sustained leap forward is determined by the following factors:

    1. The superiority of China's socialist system will be increasingly and fully demonstrated with the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the continuous development of socialist construction, and the continuous adjustment and improvement of socialist relations of production and the superstructure, so that the great leap forward situation will continue to emerge in China's socialist economic construction. 2. With the continuous development of production, the continuous innovation of technology, and the gradual realization of the technological transformation of the national economy, a solid material foundation will be laid for a sustained leap forward. 3. The general line of socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies will be further mastered by the vast number of cadres and the masses, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of cadres and the masses will be more fully utilized. 4. The leadership of the Party and the large-scale mass movement provide a fundamental guarantee for the sustained leap forward of China's national economy.

    At the same time, everyone also believes that the speed of the leap forward is different every year. Some years are higher, and some years are lower, forming a wave pattern on the basis of sustained leap forward. The main reasons are:

    1. The adjustment and improvement of socialist relations of production and the superstructure must go through a process of quantitative change to qualitative change. The promotion effect of the qualitative change period on the development of production is greater than that of the quantitative change period. In the future, the gradual transition of people's communes from the basic ownership of production teams to the basic ownership of communes, and from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, will greatly promote production. 2. The use of newly added fixed assets and newly added production capacity is different in different periods. Some years are more, and some years are less. 3. Under the current conditions, people cannot completely control extremely large natural disasters, so natural disasters still have a certain impact on agricultural production.

    (2) Regarding the relationship between high speed and proportionality: Most comrades believe that the relationship between high-speed development and proportional development of the national economy is a dialectical unity relationship. They are interdependent, mutually promoting, and mutually restricting. Unity is the main aspect, speed is in the main position, and proportion is in a subordinate position. The Party's general line of socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies are excellent examples of solving the speed and proportion problems. It enables China's national economy to develop at high speed and proportionally, and to seek balance in "high speed." As for the partial and temporary imbalances that occur in certain links in the development process, they are normal and should not be regarded as imbalances in the national economy, or equated with imbalances in the national economy.

    Individual comrades believe that the relationship between speed and proportion can be transformed into each other. That is, when the national economy is developing at high speed, speed is the main aspect of the contradiction; when the proportional relationship of the national economy is uncoordinated, proportion becomes the main aspect of the contradiction. Most comrades disagree with this view, believing that the socialist system guarantees the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy, and there will be no imbalances in the national economy. Therefore, speed always occupies a dominant position.

    Economic Issues of Rural People's Communes in China

    (1) Regarding the issue of the transition of rural people's communes from the basic ownership of production teams to the basic ownership of communes: Everyone believes that the current three-level ownership with production team ownership as the basic level implemented by people's communes is conducive to the rapid development of commune production. However, at the same time, it must be seen that it has certain limitations on the further development of the commune's productive forces and cannot stay at this level.

    Regarding the conditions and measures for transitioning to the basic ownership of communes, everyone unanimously believes that there are two aspects: economic conditions and political conditions. In terms of economic conditions, the main thing is to improve the level of productivity. The specific conditions and measures are: actively developing the economic strength of the commune level, so that it can play a leading role in the commune's economy, and at the same time, vigorously help poor teams develop production, so that poor teams can catch up with rich teams. These two aspects are a unified process that is interconnected. Regarding the sign of the dominant position of the economic strength of the commune level in commune production, most comrades believe that it is necessary to look at both the percentage of the total output value of the commune level and the percentage of the means of production. It is necessary to look at both quantity and quality. For example, the means of production such as commune-run industries and tractor stations play a very important role in commune production.

    To help poor teams catch up with rich teams, first of all, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over poor teams, strengthen the cadre force, help poor teams formulate long-term plans and annual plans for developing production and changing the backward situation, and educate cadres and members of poor teams to have lofty ambitions, establish lofty aspirations, and rely on their own efforts. In terms of material technology, it is also necessary to provide more assistance to poor teams, appropriately take care of the accumulation of profits from poor teams, and provide more national investment.

    Everyone believes that one of the fundamental problems of the transition is to develop rural productive forces, and the implementation of agricultural modernization is an important part of it. In particular, the gradual realization of agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization will greatly promote the transition from the basic ownership of production teams to the basic ownership of communes.

    Political conditions, that is, the improvement of the political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses of members, is an important condition for the transition to the basic ownership of communes. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels in rural areas must constantly conduct socialist and communist ideological education to the broad masses of members, gradually overcome localism and the remnants of private ownership ideology, recognize the superiority of changing from small collectives to large collectives, and create conditions for the smooth realization of gradual transition.

    (2) Regarding the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production: Everyone believes that the coexistence of self-sufficient production and commodity production in the production of people's communes is determined by the existence of two forms of socialist public ownership, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, and the division of labor in society. Only under the premise that the commune gives equal importance to both, and vigorously develops commodity production, can it meet the needs of national industrialization and the growing material and cultural life of the people; and only by giving equal importance to both can it increase the commune's monetary income, rapidly expand public accumulation, provide funds for the realization of agricultural technological transformation, and improve the lives of members; and create material conditions for the future transition from small collectives to large collectives and from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people. At the same time, the scale of the commune is large, the degree of collectivization is high, and grain production has had a huge increase, and it can uniformly arrange manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and has the favorable conditions for implementing the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production.

   The Issue of Commodity Production and the Law of Value in China Today

    This issue focuses on discussing the nature of several exchange relationships and how to use the law of value to serve socialist construction. After discussion, in addition to the different opinions on whether the nature of several exchange relationships is a commodity, everyone unanimously believes that the exchange between enterprises under ownership by the whole people and enterprises under collective ownership is commodity exchange under the leadership of the state plan, reflecting the relationship of mutual support and cooperation between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas; the exchange relationship between enterprises under collective ownership is also commodity exchange under the leadership of the state, reflecting the relationship of mutual cooperation and mutual exchange of needs; the exchange relationship between state-owned enterprises, whether it is commodity in substance or commodity in form, is directly managed by the state, reflecting the relationship of communist large-scale collaboration within the ownership by the whole people; the exchange relationship between the state and employees is a form of realizing distribution according to work, reflecting the relationship between national interests and individual interests and the comradely relationship between employees.

    Everyone believes that scientific analysis of these exchange relationships, exploring their regularity, and consciously using them, is of great significance to socialist construction. For example, understanding the characteristics of the exchange relationship within the ownership by the whole people enables us to recognize that workers are equal and mutually supportive, and their fundamental interests are consistent. Therefore, we must put politics in command and give top priority to the communist spirit; at the same time, there are differences in labor, and we must distribute according to work and implement economic accounting. Enterprises should implement equivalent exchange. Studying the exchange relationship between enterprises under ownership by the whole people and enterprises under collective ownership is of particularly important significance. The development of this relationship will closely link urban and rural areas, narrow the gap between workers and peasants, accelerate the pace of national industrialization and agricultural technological transformation, and promote the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people.

    Regarding the issue of using the law of value to serve socialism, most comrades believe that only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the law of value and the basic economic laws of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy can we correctly use the law of value to serve socialism. Most comrades believe that our country's policy of stabilizing prices and the relationship between prices and value is appropriate because: 1. Under the condition that prices are basically stable, the state has adjusted the price parity of industrial and agricultural products in recent years, appropriately reducing the prices of some industrial products and increasing the prices of agricultural and sideline products, so that the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products left over from history is gradually narrowing; 2. The state has given consideration to remote areas; 3. The state has adopted the method of appropriately increasing wages on the basis of continuous growth in production, and gradually improving the people's material and cultural living standards.

### 西北五省（区）经济理论会议  探讨我国社会主义建设中的若干问题

    西北五省（区）经济理论会议
    探讨我国社会主义建设中的若干问题
    1960年第二期的“经济研究”杂志上，介绍了西北五省（区）经济理论讨论会的情况。现将会上讨论的几个主要问题的主要论点介绍如下：
    国民经济高速度发展和综合平衡问题
    （1）关于国民经济高速度发展：多数人认为高速度发展是社会主义多种经济规律作用的必然结果，是社会主义经济发展所固有的必然趋势，因而它是具有规律性的，但它不是一个独立的经济规律。部分同志认为高速度发展是一个独立的经济规律，它是由社会主义生产资料公有制所决定，而且为社会主义阵营各国国民经济高速度发展的事实所证实。
    大家认为，我国国民经济发展的趋势是持久跃进的趋势，这个持久跃进的趋势是由以下几个因素决定的：
    1、我国社会主义制度的优越性将随着社会主义革命的不断深入和社会主义建设的不断发展、社会主义生产关系和上层建筑不断地调整和完善，越来越充分地发挥出来，使我国社会主义经济建设不断出现大跃进的局面。2、随着生产的不断发展，技术的不断革新，国民经济技术改造的逐步实现，将为持久跃进奠定雄厚的物质基础。3、社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针将进一步为广大干部和群众所掌握，将更充分地发挥广大干部和群众的积极性、创造性。4、党的领导和大搞群众运动为我国国民经济的持久跃进提供了根本保证。
    同时，大家还认为，每年跃进的速度是不一样的，有的年份高一些，有的年份低一些，形成持久跃进基础上的波浪式。主要的原因是：
    1、社会主义生产关系和上层建筑的调整和完善要经过一个量变到质变的过程，质变时期对生产的发展所起的促进作用比量变时期的作用要大。将来人民公社由生产队基本所有制逐步过渡到公社基本所有制，以及由社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，都将会对生产起巨大的促进作用。2、新增固定资产和新增生产能力的动用，在不同的时期是不同的，有的年份多一些，有的年份少一些。3、在当前的条件下，人们还不能完全控制特大的自然灾害，因而自然灾害对农业生产还有一定的影响。
      （2）关于高速度和按比例的关系问题：多数同志认为国民经济高速度发展和按比例发展的关系是辩证统一的关系，它们之间相互依存，相互促进，相互制约。其中统一是主要的，速度居于主要地位，比例处于从属的地位。党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针是卓越地解决速度和比例的典范，它使我国国民经济既能高速度发展，又能按比例发展，能够在“高速度中求平衡”。至于发展过程中在某些环节上出现局部的暂时的不平衡现象则是正常的，不能把它看作是国民经济比例失调，或者把它与国民经济比例失调等同起来。
    个别同志认为速度和比例的关系是可以互相转化的。即当国民经济高速度发展时速度是矛盾的主要方面；当国民经济比例关系不协调时，则比例成为矛盾的主要方面。多数同志不同意这种意见，认为社会主义制度保证了国民经济高速度按比例发展，不会出现国民经济比例失调的情况，因此速度始终都居于主导地位。
    我国农村人民公社经济问题
    （1）关于农村人民公社由生产队基本所有制过渡到公社基本所有制问题：大家认为，人民公社目前实行的生产队一级所有权是基本的三级所有制是有利于公社生产的迅速发展的。但同时必须看到它对公社生产力的进一步发展是有一定局限性的，不能停留在此水平上。
    对于过渡到公社基本所有制的条件和措施，大家一致认为有经济条件和政治条件两个方面。在经济条件方面，主要是提高生产力水平，具体条件和措施是：积极发展公社一级经济力量，使其能在公社经济中起主导作用，同时大力帮助穷队发展生产，使穷队赶上富队，这两个方面是相互联系的统一过程。对于公社一级经济力量在公社生产中占主导地位的标志问题，多数同志认为既要看公社一级总产值所占的百分比，又要看生产资料所占的百分比，既要看数量，又要看质量。如社办工业、拖拉机站等生产资料在公社生产中起着非常重要的作用。
    帮助穷队赶富队首先要加强党对穷队的领导，加强干部力量，帮助穷队制定发展生产改变落后面貌的长远规划和年度计划，教育穷队干部和社员要立大志，树雄心，自力更生。在物质技术方面也要多援助穷队，适当地照顾穷队积累提成并给予较多的国家投资。
    大家认为，过渡的根本问题之一是发展农村生产力，实行农业现代化是它的重要内容，特别是农业半机械化和机械化的逐步实现将大大的促进由生产队基本所有制向公社基本所有制的过渡。
    政治条件，即广大社员政治思想觉悟的提高是过渡到公社基本所有制的重要条件。因此，农村各级党组织必须不断地向广大社员进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育，逐步克服本位主义和私有制思想残余，认识由小集体变为大集体的优越性，为顺利的实现逐步过渡创造条件。
    （2）关于自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针问题：大家认为，人民公社生产中自给性生产和商品性生产同时存在，是由当前我国存在全民所有制和集体所有制两种社会主义公有制形式与社会分工决定的。公社只有在二者同时并举的前提下，大力发展商品性生产，才能满足国家工业化和人民群众物质文化生活日益增长的需要；也只有二者同时并举，才能增加公社货币收入，迅速扩大公共积累，为实现农业技术改造提供资金与改善社员的生活；并为将来由小集体过渡到大集体、由社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制创造物质条件。同时公社规模大集体化程度高，粮食生产已有了巨大的增长，可以统一的安排人力、物力、财力，具有实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的有利条件。
   当前我国商品生产和价值规律问题
    这个问题着重讨论了几种交换关系的性质和如何利用价值规律为社会主义建设服务两个问题。经过讨论后，除了对几种交换关系的性质是否是商品的问题仍有不同意见外，大家一致认为，全民所有制企业与集体所有制企业之间的交换，是国家计划领导下的商品交换，体现着工农之间、城乡之间，互相支援、互助合作的关系；集体所有制企业之间的交换关系也是国家领导下的商品交换，体现着互相协作、互通有无的关系；国营企业之间的交换关系，不论其为实质上的商品或形式上的商品，都是国家直接管理的，体现着全民所有制内部共产主义大协作的关系；国家与职工之间的交换关系，是实现按劳分配的形式，体现着国家利益与个人利益的关系和职工之间的同志关系。
    大家认为对这几种交换关系进行科学的分析，探明其规律性，从而自觉地加以利用，对社会主义建设有很大的意义。例如认识了全民所有制内部交换关系的特点，就能使我们既认识到劳动者彼此是平等互助关系，根本利益相一致，因此必须把政治挂帅，发扬共产主义精神放在首要地位；同时又有着劳动的差别，必须按劳分配，实行经济核算，企业之间要实行等价交换。研究全民所有制企业与集体所有制企业之间的交换关系具有特别重要的意义。这种关系的发展，会密切城乡关系，缩小工农差别，加快国家工业化和农业技术改造的步伐，促进集体所有制向全民所有制过渡。
    对于利用价值规律为社会主义服务的问题，多数同志认为，只有正确的认识和处理价值规律与社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的关系，才能正确的利用价值规律为社会主义服务。大多数同志认为，我们国家采取稳定物价的政策，价格与价值的关系是合适的，因为1、在物价基本稳定的情况下，几年来国家对工农业产品的比价进行了调整，适当的降低了一些工业品价格，而提高了农副产品的价格，使历史上遗留下来的工农业产品价格的剪刀差在逐渐缩小；2、国家对边远地区给予了照顾；3、国家采取了在生产不断增长的基础上适当提高工资的办法，逐步提高人民的物质文化生活水平。
