    Female Teacher in the Mine
    By our staff reporter Yao Guilan
    It's three o'clock in the morning, the cold wind is biting, and snow is falling heavily. Miners who have just finished their shift are waiting for their teacher in the clean classroom to start the lesson. With only a few minutes left until the class starts, someone suggests: The snow is so heavy and the weather is so cold, and the teacher lives so far away. I'm afraid she won't be able to make it. Let's study on our own!
    Before the words had faded, a "snowman" walked in from outside the door. This "snowman" was their teacher, Ding Yuqing, the female teacher in the mine who has repeatedly been awarded the title of "Excellent Teacher". For five years, she has stuck to her post, helping more than 800 miners remove their illiterate labels and master cultural weapons. When the workers of Benxi Coal Mine mention her, they all say: Ding Yuqing is the cultural sower of the mine.

            Listening to the Party's Words
    On a clear day in the autumn of 1954, Ding Yuqing came to Benxi Coal Mine's spare-time school for the first time. The bell rang, and she excitedly walked into the classroom with her books. The leaders had told her that there were more than fifty students in this class. But she waited for more than half an hour, and only six students came.
    The same thing happened for three consecutive days. She couldn't bear it anymore, so she went to the leading comrades to ask to go back to teaching elementary school. The conversation with the Party's leading comrades was like a key, opening the door to Ding Yuqing's memories. She remembered that when she was ten years old, she was so envious when she saw other children going to school. But every time she mentioned going to school, her father would sadly say, "Silly child, look, which miner's child can afford to go to school!" But her mother insisted on finding a way for her to go to school. She said: If the child wants to go to school, let her study for two years. Look at our family, we're all "staring-eyed illiterates."
    After only two years of schooling, she dropped out because her father was laid off. Later, her two older brothers also went down the coal pit to sell their lives, and it was only with great difficulty that they were able to support her for a few more years of schooling. She often thought: If it hadn't been for liberation, not to mention adult coal miners, even their children wouldn't have been able to go to school! But today, not only the children of miners, but even adult miners, the Party has arranged for them to study. Recalling these things, she couldn't sleep for several nights in a row. She secretly made up her mind: she must help the miners learn culture well.
    But why weren't the students coming to class? Every day after class, she talked with the students to understand what difficulties they had. It turned out that some teachers in the past did not fully consider the characteristics of adults in teaching, the progress was too fast, and the characters were written in cursive, so the workers could not remember them, and slowly they lost the confidence to come to class. Ding Yuqing believed that these were easy to solve, and she must guarantee that she would find a way to get the workers to come to school.
    One Sunday, the workers were all resting at home. Ding Yuqing came to the mine very early and visited the workers' residential areas in the mine house by house with her students. When class started on Monday, eleven of the thirteen students she had visited came to class. She accepted the students' suggestions and wrote the characters in large strokes, explaining the text carefully. She saw that some students couldn't write some characters, so she taught them by holding their hands. She wrote the lessons that had been missed in the past on the blackboard to help everyone review and make up the lessons. The students said, "The teacher is so enthusiastic that we can overcome any difficulty." After a month, the attendance rate of students reached more than 90%, and even those who had not participated in the study in the past also came to listen to the class.

          A Teacher and Also a Student
    One day in the mine, coal miner Li Renshan was swinging his axe to build a shed near the windlass that was rumbling loudly, when he suddenly noticed a person slowly climbing towards their working face. Judging from the clumsy way he climbed, he knew it was his first time down the mine. Who was this person? After climbing up to him, Li Renshan looked at him for a long time before he could see clearly that it was Ding Yuqing. He asked in surprise: "Teacher Ding, what are you doing down the mine?" Ding Yuqing said breathlessly: "I'm here to learn from you." In the mine, she carefully observed everything and constantly asked questions: What is this called? What is that used for? Her students enthusiastically told her: This is a scraper conveyor; that is called a crossbeam. She used the light of her miner's lamp to write these down in her notebook. In one shift, she wrote down dozens of coal mine terms.
    It turned out that after there were more and more students, a new problem arose - how to combine teaching with production so that students could learn quickly and remember firmly? To solve this problem, she held seminars and talked with students individually. Many people reflected: it is easy to recognize new characters, but it is difficult to remember them. Some people have also suggested: after recognizing new characters, if they can be used in production and used frequently, they will not be forgotten. She thought that the students' opinions made sense. From then on, whenever she had time, she went down the mine, using the mine as a classroom and the workers' labor as teaching material to study how to combine the text with the workers' production.
    The names of tools and the terms commonly used in production became the best materials for her to explain new characters or texts. This made it easier for students to understand and remember, and the effect was very good. Once, when she talked about the character "巷" (lane), she told the students: This "巷" character is the "巷" of "大街小巷" (streets and lanes), which is also the "巷" character of "巷道" (roadway) that workers often say. Some workers said meaningfully after hearing this: "The "巷" of "大街小巷" is the "巷道" that we miners say. I will never forget it in my life after the teacher explained it like this." Finally, Ding Yuqing, combined with various labors in the mine, compiled a literacy chart of about 1,500 characters suitable for the needs of coal miners. Whenever she gave a class, she would combine these into the text. Using this teaching method greatly accelerated the speed of literacy.

          The Miner's Confidante
    Once, Ding Yuqing was teaching a class, when suddenly a person came in, without taking off his work clothes, with a face full of "coal dust", busy finding a seat to sit down, and listening carefully to the class. Ding Yuqing recognized him at once as coal miner Zhang Yuxin, but why was he so late? And why has he been late for the past few days?
    After class, she stopped Zhang Yuxin and kindly asked him why he was always late these days, and if he had any difficulties. Zhang Yuxin told her shyly: A few days ago, the leaders asked him to be the squad leader, and there were more things to do as a squad leader. He had to go down the pit early and leave the pit late, so he often came late these days. Then he told her in detail the difficulties he encountered in his work. He said that when he became the squad leader, he had to make plans, arrange tasks, and report on production. He couldn't write, so he only relied on his brain to remember. Sometimes he remembered the front, but forgot the back. The first thing he had to do as a squad leader was to call the roll before going down the pit. But he couldn't recognize anyone's name except his own, so he had no choice but to ask someone else to call the roll for him every day.
    Ding Yuqing told him: "From tomorrow onwards, you can bring me the list of all the people in the squad, and I will help you study in your spare time." From then on, whenever he had time, Zhang Yuxin would go to Teacher Ding to learn. In less than half a month, Zhang Yuxin had learned the names of all forty-odd people in the squad. Twenty days later, Zhang Yuxin was able to call the roll himself at the pit entrance.
    Once, miner Jiang Diansheng didn't come to class for two or three consecutive days. Ding Yuqing asked others, but no one knew the reason. After class that day, she came to Jiang Diansheng's house. It turned out that Jiang Diansheng's wife had a backache and couldn't get out of bed, and her child had diphtheria. Because of the treatment, they had spent all their wages, and Jiang Diansheng was worried. After Ding Yuqing came back, she reported the situation to the leaders, and the trade union immediately subsidized Jiang Diansheng with fifty yuan. The next day, Jiang Diansheng was about to take his wife to the hospital to see a doctor, when Ding Yuqing saw him and said to Jiang Diansheng: "You go to sleep quickly, I will take your wife to see a doctor." When Jiang Diansheng insisted on not doing so, Ding Yuqing said like an elder sister: "There is a shift tonight, and you have to study after work, go to sleep quickly!" Jiang Diansheng was so moved that he didn't know what to do.
    Over the past few years, Ding Yuqing, the female teacher in the mine, has been enthusiastically caring for her students in this way. In order to let the workers master culture faster, she often climbed hills and crossed ridges to go to the students' homes to give extra lessons in her spare time. So far, she has been to more than 400 homes. The miners all said enthusiastically: Ding Yuqing is not only a teacher, but also the most intimate friend.

            Five Years as One Day
    From her home to the school, she had to go down a large winding mountain road, cross a small hill, and pass through a large tunnel, a distance of more than five miles. In the summer, she often held an umbrella and went back and forth on the mountain road in the pouring rain; in the winter, she often tied straw ropes to her shoes and held a wooden stick in her hand, battling in the piercing wind and snow. But she never complained of bitterness or said a difficulty. Once, at more than two o'clock at night, she was about to go out when she found that the wind and snow outside were very strong. She supported herself with a wooden stick and still went out. The biting north wind howled in front of and behind the mountain, constantly blowing open her repeatedly pressed placket, and the slanting snowflakes, like knives, beat against her face. The road was slippery and difficult to walk. When passing a hillside, she suddenly fell. The fall was very heavy. When she regained some consciousness, she realized that her head had hit a wooden stake, her nose was broken, and blood was flowing straight down. But what she thought of at this time was the workers waiting for her to teach, she resolutely picked up the stick, carried her bag, and walked forward carefully.
    Once, her youngest daughter was sick, not eating, with a high fever, and unconscious. This made her very anxious. She made up her mind at the time to take a day off the next day and take her child to see a doctor. But as soon as she lay in bed, her original plan was overturned by herself. She thought: If she took her child to see a doctor the next day, wouldn't more than 100 workers be delayed for a class? If she didn't take her child, she was afraid that something might happen to her. At this time, her heart was half on her child and half on her students. She thought: The workers insisted on eight hours of production in the mine and mined hundreds of tons of coal. They are already tired enough, but they still insist on studying on time, and they must overcome difficulties. A force to overcome difficulties encouraged her: Every minute of time is precious to the workers and must not be wasted. Finally, she carried her child and went to the emergency room overnight. The next day, before dawn, she appeared in the classroom again.
    Our Party is constantly teaching every Party member how to overcome difficulties and how to love every task of the collective. Ding Yuqing is a Communist Party member, and in accordance with the Party's instructions, she has done what she should do in her ordinary position.

    矿山女教师
    本报记者　姚桂兰
    深夜三点钟，寒风凛冽，大雪纷飞。刚刚下班的矿工，正在整洁的教室里等着老师来上课。到上课的时间只剩几分钟了，有人提议说：雪这么大，天这么冷，老师的家离得又远，怕不能来了，咱们自学吧！
    话还没有落音，只见门外走进一个“雪人”来。这个“雪人”就是他们的老师，就是屡次获得“优秀教师”称号的矿山女教师丁玉清。她五年如一日地坚守着自己的岗位，帮助八百多名矿工摘掉了文盲帽子，掌握了文化武器。本溪煤矿的工人，一提起她，都说：丁玉清是矿山的文化播种者。
            听党的话
    1954年秋天的一个晴朗的日子，丁玉清第一次来到了本溪煤矿业余学校。铃响了，她兴奋地拿着书本走进了教室。领导上曾告诉她，这个班有五十多名学生。可是她等了半个多小时，才等来了六名。
    一连三天都是这样。她再也忍耐不住了，就去找领导同志要求回去教小学。党的领导同志的谈话，像一把钥匙，打开了丁玉清回忆的大门。她想起，自己十岁那年，看见别的孩子去上学，自己多么羡慕。可是每次她一说上学，爸爸就伤心地说：“傻孩子，你看看，哪个矿工的孩子能上得起学呀！”倒是妈妈主张想办法让她上学，她说：孩子想上学，就让她念两年，你看咱们一家子，都是“瞪眼瞎”。
    刚刚上了两年学，因为爸爸被解雇，她也就失学了。后来她的两个哥哥也都去下煤洞卖命，好不容易才又供她念了几年书。她常常想：要不是解放了，不用说成年的煤矿工人，就是他们的孩子，也念不上书啊！可是今天，不但矿工的孩子，就连成年的矿工，党都安排好让他们学习。她回想起这些，一连好几宿都睡不着。她暗暗下定决心：一定帮助矿工学好文化。
    可是为什么学生们不来上课呢？每天下课后，她就和学生们交谈，了解他们有什么困难。原来是过去有的教师在教学上没有充分照顾成年人的特点，进度太快，字写的又草，工人们记不下来，慢慢地就没有信心来上课了。丁玉清认为，这都是容易解决的问题，一定要保证想办法让工人们都来上学。
    一个星期日，工人们都在家休息。丁玉清很早就来到矿山，同她的几个学生在矿山的工人住宅区里挨户访问。到星期一上课时，她访问过的十三个学生，有十一个都来上课了。她接受学生们的意见，一笔一画，把字写得大大的，仔细地把课文讲清楚。她看到学生们有的字不会写，便把着手去教他们。把过去拉下的课，写在黑板上帮助大家复习和补课。学生们说：“老师这样热心，我们再有天大困难，也能克服得了。”一个月之后，学生的出席率达到了90％以上，而且过去没参加学习的人，也都来听课了。
          是教师也是学生
    有一天在矿井里，采煤工李仁山正在哒哒哒轰鸣着的风镐附近，挥舞着斧头棚棚子，突然发现有一个人，正向着他们的掌子面慢慢地爬来，看爬的那股笨劲，就知道是头一次下井。这个人是谁呢？等爬到跟前，李仁山端详好半天，才看清是丁玉清。他惊讶地问：“丁老师，你下井做什么来了？”丁玉清喘着气说：“我是向你们学习来了。”在井下，她仔细观察每件事物，并不断地发问：这个叫什么？那是干什么呢？她的学生们，热情地告诉她：这就是刮板溜子；那就叫穿梁子。她借着矿灯的光，把这些都记在小本子上。一个班的工夫，她就记了几十种煤井下的术语。
    原来是这样，自从学生越来越多之后，又出现了一个新的问题——怎样才能把教学同生产结合起来，让学生学得又快，记得又扎实呢？为了这个问题，她召开过座谈会，找学生个别谈过话。很多人都反映：认生字容易，可要记住就难了。也曾有人建议：认识了生字之后，如果能在生产上用得着，经常用，就不会忘了。她一想，学生们的意见有道理。从那以后，一有时间，她就下矿井，把矿井当成课堂，把工人的劳动当成教材，研究如何把课文同工人的生产结合起来。
    工具的名称，生产上常用的术语，成了她讲解生字或课文的最好的材料。这样做，学生容易理解和记忆，效果很好。有一次讲到“巷”字，她就告诉学生：这个“巷”字，是大街小巷的巷，也就是工人常说的“巷道”的巷字。有的工人听了之后，意味深长地说：“这个大街小巷的巷，原来就是我们矿工说的‘巷道’的巷，老师这么一讲，我这一辈子也忘不了啦。”最后，丁玉清结合着井下的各种劳动，编写出一张适合于煤矿工人需要的约一千五百字的识字图表。每当一讲课，她便把这些结合到课文里去。运用这种教学方法，大大加快了扫盲速度。
          矿工的知心朋友
    有一次，丁玉清正在上课，突然进来一个人，连工作服都没脱，带着满脸“煤面子”，忙着找个位子坐下，便细心地听课。丁玉清一下子就认出来，是采煤工张玉新，可是他为什么来的这么晚呢？而且这几天都是来得很晚？
    下课后，她叫住了张玉新，就亲切地问他这几天为什么老是来得晚，是不是有什么困难？张玉新腼腆地告诉她：前些日子，领导上让他当班长，一当班长事就多啦，要早下坑、晚离开坑，所以这几天常常来的晚。跟着便一五一十地把他在工作上碰到的困难说了出来。说他当了班长，就要做计划，布置任务，汇报生产情况。他不会写，就只凭着脑子记，有时记住了前边，又忘掉了后边。当了班长，首先一项工作，就是在下坑前点名。可是他除了自己的名字以外，谁的名字也认不全，没有办法，每天只好请别人代点名。
    丁玉清就告诉他：“从明天起，你就把全班人的名单拿来，我帮助你在业余时间学习。”从那以后，一有时间，张玉新就到丁老师那里去学。不到半个月，张玉新就把全班四十多个人名学会了。二十天后，张玉新就能自己在坑口上点名了。
    有一次，矿工蒋殿生一连两三天没来上课，丁玉清问别人，别人都不知道什么原因。这天下课后，她便来到蒋殿生家里。原来蒋殿生的爱人腰痛的起不来炕，孩子得了白喉，因为治病，把工资花完了，蒋殿生正在发愁。丁玉清回来后，便把情况汇报给领导，工会马上补助了蒋殿生五十元钱。第二天，蒋殿生正要领着妻子到医院看病，丁玉清见了就对蒋殿生说：“你赶快去睡觉，我领你爱人去看病。”当蒋殿生执意不肯时，丁玉清便像大姐一样地说：“晚上还有班，下班后还要学习，快去睡吧！”蒋殿生感动得不知如何是好。
    几年来，矿山女教师丁玉清，就是这样热情地关怀着她的学生们。为了让工人快一些掌握文化，就在业余休息时间，她常常爬坡过岭到学生家里去给补课。到目前为止，她已经到过四百多家了。矿工们都热情地说：丁玉清不仅是老师，而且是最知心的朋友。
            五年如一日
    从她家到学校，要下一个大盘山道，翻过一个小山头，穿越一条大隧道，得走五里多路。夏天，她经常是撑着一把伞，顶着瓢泼大雨往返在山路上；冬天，经常是鞋上绑着草绳，手拿着一根木棍，战斗在刺骨的风雪里。可是她没有叫过一声苦，说过一个难。有一次，夜里两点多钟，她刚要往外走，发现外面风雪刮得很紧。她拄了一根木棍，还是走了出去。凛冽的北风在山前山后呼啸着，不时吹开她一再压着的衣襟，斜飘着的小雪粒，像刀子样扑打在脸上。路上滑得难走。在过一个山坡时，她忽然摔倒了。这一跤摔得很重。当她清醒一些，才发现自己的头撞在木桩上，鼻子也跌破了，血直往下流。可是她这时所想到的，是等着她上课的工人，她毅然拄起棍子，背好书包，小心地往前走去。
    有一次，她的小女儿病了，不吃饭，发高烧，昏迷不醒。这可把她急坏了。她当时下了狠心，准备第二天请一天假，带着孩子去看病。可是刚刚躺在床上，原来的打算又被自己推翻了。她想：如果第二天带孩子去看病，那么一百多名工人不要耽误一堂课么？有心不带孩子去，又怕孩子有个三长两短。这时，她的心一半放在孩子身上，一半放在学生身上。她想：工人在矿井里，坚持了八个小时生产，采出成百吨的煤炭，已经够累的了，他们还按时来坚持学习，自己也要克服困难。一种战胜困难的力量鼓舞着她：每一分钟的时间，对于工人们来说，都是宝贵的，决不能浪费工人一分钟。终于，她背起孩子，连夜去看了急诊。第二天天还没亮，她又出现在课堂上。
    我们的党时刻在教导着每个党员，应该怎样去战胜困难；应该怎样去热爱集体的每一项工作。丁玉清是一个共产党员，她按照党的指示，在平凡的岗位上，做到了她应做的工作。
