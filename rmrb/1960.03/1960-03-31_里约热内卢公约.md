    Rio de Janeiro Treaty

   The "Rio de Janeiro Treaty," also known as the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" or the "Western Hemisphere Mutual Defense Treaty," was imposed on Latin American countries by U.S. imperialism during the Pan-American Union (now the Organization of American States) conference held in Rio de Janeiro in 1947. This treaty is actually a tool used by the United States to strengthen its control and aggression against Latin American countries. In response to the rising national liberation movements and anti-dictatorial struggles in Latin American countries, the treaty specifically stipulates that if any American country "suffers an act of aggression which is not an armed attack" or faces other "threats," all countries should immediately agree on "collective defense" and "measures to be taken." Under U.S. manipulation, two special meetings were held in June 1959, attempting to invoke this treaty to "investigate" the situation in Nicaragua, using it as a pretext to interfere in Nicaragua's anti-dictatorial armed struggle. Since the victory of the Cuban revolution, the United States has been trying to use the Pan-American Treaty to establish a so-called "Organization of American States police force." Recently, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom has once again clamored to use the Pan-American Treaty to threaten and interfere with Cuba.

    里约热内卢公约
   “里约热内卢公约”又称“泛美联防公约”或“西半球联防公约”。它是一九四七年泛美联盟（即现在的美洲国家组织）在里约热内卢举行会议时由美帝国主义强加给拉丁美洲各国。这个公约实际上是美国借以加强控制和侵略拉丁美洲国家的工具。针对拉丁美洲各国日益高涨的民族解放运动和反独裁斗争，条约特别规定美洲任何一国“由于非武装攻击之侵略”或遭其他“威胁”时，各国应即商定“共同防御”和“所需采取之措施”。一九五九年六月在美国操纵下曾举行两次特别会议，企图援用这个条约以“调查”尼加拉瓜局势为名对尼加拉瓜的反独裁武装斗争进行干涉。古巴革命胜利以来，美国一直打算借用泛美公约来建立一支所谓“美洲国家组织警察部队”。最近美国助理国务卿鲁博特姆又叫嚷要利用泛美公约来对古巴进行威胁和干涉。
