    Elderly Workers Have Meager Incomes and Live Miserably
    France
    The French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" recently revealed that in France there are 1.5 million elderly workers whose daily pensions and "mutual aid funds" are only 2.84 francs (new francs, same below). The 290,000 elderly workers who are not eligible for pensions have even lower incomes, only 1.9 francs per day. Elderly workers also cannot enjoy the benefits of social insurance, and cannot get medical expenses and medicines when they are sick. Even for elderly workers with higher incomes, their daily income of less than 3 francs is only about one-third of the French minimum wage.

    老年工人收入微薄生活凄惨
    法国
    法国资产阶级报纸“战斗报”最近透露，法国有一百五十万老年工人每天所得的养老金和“互助基金”只有二点八四法郎（新法郎，下同），不够资格拿养老金的二十九万老年工人的收入还要少，每天只有一点九法郎。老年工人还不能享受社会保险的利益，在生病时不能得到医疗费和药品。即使是收入较多的老年工人，他每天不到三法郎的收入也只有法国最低工资的三分之一左右。
