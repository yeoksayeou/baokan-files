Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 22nd: Shanghai's iron and steel workers, focusing on vigorously promoting operational innovations and various advanced experiences in converters, open-hearth furnaces, and electric furnaces, have continuously increased production in March. Up to the 20th, the average daily steel production increased by 28% in the middle ten days of the month compared to the first ten days, and steel output increased by more than 4,000 tons compared to the first ten days.

Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's steel plants have universally promoted innovative technologies in converter workshops, such as hot-air alkaline iron furnaces and the utilization of pre-furnace waste heat; in open-hearth furnaces, they have promoted operations such as blowing compressed air into the molten pool, adding pulverized coal to the furnace head, and adding slag to the furnace back for desulfurization; in electric furnaces, they have promoted various measures for more loading and faster smelting, promoting a steady increase in steel production and quality, and a monthly decrease in raw material consumption. After entering March, the workers in each plant, focusing on high yield, high quality, low consumption, and multiple varieties, launched competitions between shifts and groups, promoting steel production to rise every ten-day period. In order to summarize and create high-yield experiences, the leaders of each plant and cadres at the workshop level also went deep into the workshops, sections, and groups to work alongside workers and technicians to carry out "experimental furnaces."

Through competitions between furnaces, the steel output of open-hearth and electric furnace workers has also continued to increase. For example, after winning the national high-yield red flag for small open-hearth furnaces in February, the open-hearth furnace of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant more closely grasped the implementation of various advanced experiences and measures in March. At the same time, it carried out a competition of more loading and faster smelting on the furnace. In twenty days, it created three new high-yield records in a row. The steel output increased from an average daily output of 378 tons in the first ten days to 489.5 tons in the middle ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 22nd: Since the middle of March, the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have launched a vigorous movement of "Being the Same as the Advanced Level." The entire company, from factories to workshops, from furnaces to workers, has established advanced pacesetters at all levels, and taken measures to catch up bravely, promoting a rapid increase in steel production. In this ten-day period, the company's average daily steel production level increased by 9.1% compared to the first ten days, steel materials increased by 33.4%, and iron and coke also increased respectively.

In the "Being the Same" movement, all units were determined to catch up with the most advanced level of the same type of equipment in national iron and steel enterprises, and have begun to achieve results. The workers of the open-hearth steelmaking plant proposed that in terms of utilization coefficient and furnace maintenance, they should catch up with Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 20 furnace, and make the charging volume of medium-sized open-hearth furnaces catch up with large open-hearth furnaces, and the smelting time the same as small open-hearth furnaces. The workers immediately took many measures around expanding the charging volume and shortening the smelting time. They overcame the difficulty of insufficient cranes and used small cranes to modify two small molten steel ladles, realizing a major innovation of dual-slot four-ladle steel tapping, which expanded the open-hearth furnace's charging volume by one-third at once, while the smelting time was shortened by 34 minutes compared to the average smelting time of the previous week, and the furnace output reached more than 200 tons.

Many units of workers organized amateur engineering commando teams, helping and supporting each other in the movement, which also vigorously promoted the increase in steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 22nd: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's production system held a joint technical demonstration competition and achieved a major victory. Compared with the first ten days of March, the average daily production of steel and iron in the middle ten days increased by 46% and 9.3% respectively.

In order to ensure the completion of iron and steel production tasks, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee decided to organize a joint technical demonstration competition of the production system, making a big noise in technical revolution and guaranteeing iron and steel. With the Party Committee's order, tens of thousands of workers from dozens of units and departments, such as ironmaking, steelmaking, coking, refractory materials, mining, fuel, and transportation, joined the battle. The workers of the steelmaking plant moved into the factory from the dormitory area more than ten miles away. Leading cadres divided their work to work with the shifts, finding and solving problems in production day and night together with the workers.

In the joint demonstration competition, the steelmaking workers focused on the key of batching and charging, summarized and promoted advanced batching and charging experience, and created methods such as electrified maintenance of loading machines and automatic gas reversing. The fundamental problem that used to affect the further improvement of pig iron production was the abnormal supply of sintered ore. This problem was also successfully resolved in the demonstration competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 22nd: Anshan Iron and Steel's thirteen rolling mills have completed the steel production plan for the first quarter ten days and eight hours ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 2,280 tons. The qualified rate of steel has also exceeded the plan by 0.82%.

On the basis of carrying out large-scale technical demonstration competitions last year, Anshan Iron and Steel's rolling mills have created a new form of key problem tackling demonstration competitions this year. This kind of demonstration competition can mobilize workers to put forward innovation suggestions and innovation operation methods around the key to production, and then through the demonstration competition, enable workers to quickly master and improve new operation technologies and break through the key to production. In February alone, the workers put forward more than 37,000 innovation suggestions, realized more than 21,000, and made the steel output exceed the plan by 7.5%, and increase by 3.7% compared with January. After entering March, in response to the proposal of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the key problem tackling demonstration competition was even more enthusiastic; from March 1st to 17th alone, more than 10,000 technical innovation suggestions were put forward, more than 7,000 were realized, 1,148 production keys were broken through, and 592 new production records were created. The average daily steel production level increased by 6.6% compared with February.

Now, the workers of each rolling mill are advancing victoriously, striving to increase the production of more steel to support the whole country in the last few days of the first quarter, while overhauling equipment, discussing plans, and doing a good job in preparing for the second quarter's production work.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 20th: Daye Steel Plant's iron and steel production plan for the first quarter has been completed ahead of schedule. As of March 16th, the cumulative output of steel and iron in the whole plant had completed the first quarter plan, exceeding the quota by 0.49% and 0.09% respectively; compared with the average daily output in the fourth quarter of last year, steel increased by 40.82% and iron increased by 47.76%.

This plant continued to fully utilize the experience of organizing "key problem tackling battles" that proved effective last year. Since January, the workers of the entire plant have organized four "key problem tackling battles" around the general direction of high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties, so that production keys are constantly broken through, and production levels are rising steadily. In the recent five days, the average daily steel production has surged by 19.96% compared to the first ten days of March, and the average daily steel production has surged by 25.32% compared to the first ten days of March.

In order to combine technical innovation and technical revolution well with the completion of the national plan, this plant has also used and developed the experience of grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping concretely last year, thereby achieving monthly red and full house red in the first quarter.

    上海
    据新华社上海22日电　上海钢铁战线职工在转炉、平炉、电炉上围绕着大搞操作革新和推行各种先进经验，使3月份生产不断上升。到20日止，钢的平均日产量中旬比上旬增长28％，钢材比上旬增产了四千多吨。
    上海各钢铁厂今年以来，曾经在转炉车间普遍推行热风碱性化铁炉和利用前炉余热的革新技术；平炉上推行熔池吹压缩空气、炉头加煤粉、炉后加渣料脱硫等操作；电炉上推行了各种多装快炼的措施，促使钢产量、质量稳步上升，原料材料消耗逐月降低。进入3月以后，各厂职工围绕着高产优质低耗多品种，展开了班与班组与组之间的竞赛，推动钢铁生产一旬高过一旬。为了总结和创造高产经验，各厂的领导和车间一级干部，还纷纷深入车间、工段、小组，跟班劳动，同工人技术人员一道大搞“试验炉”。
    平炉、电炉工人通过炉与炉之间的竞赛，钢产量也不断提高。如上钢一厂平炉，2月份夺得全国小型平炉高产红旗以后，3月份更抓紧各项先进经验和措施的贯彻，同时在炉上开展多装快炼竞赛，二十天中连创了三个高产新纪录，钢产量从上旬平均日产三百七十八吨提高到中旬日产四百八十九点五吨。
    重钢
    据新华社重庆22日电　重庆钢铁公司职工从3月中旬起开展了轰轰烈烈的“和先进水平一个样”的运动。全公司从各工厂到车间，从炉子到工人，都层层树立起先进标兵，并且采取措施勇猛追赶，促使钢铁产量迅速提高。这一旬，全公司钢的日产水平比上旬提高了9．1％，钢材提高33．4％，铁和焦也都分别有了提高。
    在“一个样”运动中，各单位都立志要赶上全国钢铁企业同类型设备最先进的水平，而且开始取得成绩。平炉炼钢厂的职工提出，在利用系数和维护炉体方面，要赶上上钢三厂和鞍钢二十号炉，并使中型平炉的装入量赶上大型平炉，冶炼时间同小型平炉一个样。职工们立即围绕扩大装入量和缩短冶炼时间，采取很多措施。他们克服吊车不足的困难，利用小吊车改装了两个小钢水包，实现双槽四包出钢的重大革新，使平炉装入量一下就扩大了三分之一，而冶炼时间却比前一周的平均冶炼时间缩短了三十四分钟，炉产达到二百吨以上。
    很多单位职工组织了业余工程突击队，在运动中互相帮助、互相支援，也有力地促进钢产量上升。
    武钢
    据新华社武汉22日电　武汉钢铁公司生产系统举行联合技术表演赛获得重大胜利。同3月上旬比较，中旬钢和铁的平均日产量分别提高了46％、9．3％。
    为了确保钢铁生产任务的完成，武钢党委决定以中旬为第一战役，组织一次生产系统的联合技术大表演赛，大闹技术革命，保铁保钢。党委一声令下，炼铁、炼钢、焦化、耐火、矿山、燃料、运输等几十个单位和部门的数万名职工，投入战斗。炼钢厂工人从十几里路外的宿舍区搬进了厂内。领导干部分工跟班劳动，日夜同工人一道发现和解决生产中的问题。
    在联合表演赛中，炼钢工人围绕配料和装料关键，总结推广了先进的配料装料经验，并且创造了带电检修上料机和煤气自动换向等方法。过去影响生铁产量进一步提高的根本问题，是烧结矿的供应不正常。在表演赛中，也顺利地解决了这一问题。
    鞍钢
    据新华社鞍山22日电　鞍钢十三个轧钢厂，已提前十天零八小时，超额两千二百八十吨胜利完成了第一季度的钢材生产计划，钢材合格率也比计划超过0．82％。
    鞍钢各轧钢厂在去年大搞技术表演赛的基础上，今年又创造了攻关表演赛的新形式。这种表演赛可以发动职工围绕生产关键，提出革新建议、革新操作方法，再通过表演赛，使工人很快掌握与提高新的操作技术，攻破生产关键。仅在2月份，职工们就提出革新建议三万七千多件，实现了两万一千多件，使钢材产量比计划超过7．5％，比1月份提高3．7％。进入3月份，各轧钢厂响应了石景山钢铁公司倡议以后，攻关表演赛更是热火朝天；仅3月1日到17日，就提出技术革新建议一万多件，实现了七千多件，攻破了一千一百四十八个生产关键，创造了五百九十二个生产新纪录，钢材平均日产水平又比2月份提高6．6％。
    现在，各轧钢厂的职工正在乘胜前进，力争在第一季度最后几天内，增产更多的钢材支援全国，同时检修设备、讨论计划，做好第二季度的生产准备工作。
    冶钢
    据新华社武汉20日电　大冶钢厂第一季度的钢铁生产计划已提前完成。到3月16日止，全厂钢、铁累计产量分别超额0．49％和0．09％完成了第一季度计划；同去年第四季度的平均日产量相比，钢提高了40．82％，铁提高了47．76％。
    这个厂继续充分运用了去年行之有效的组织“攻关战役”的经验。从1月份以来，全厂职工围绕高产、优质、多品种这一总的方向，先后组织了四次“攻关战役”，使生产关键不断突破，生产水平节节上升。在最近五天内，钢的平均日产量比3月上旬猛增19．96％，钢材平均日产量比3月上旬猛增25．32％。
    为了把技术革新和技术革命同完成国家计划很好地结合起来，这个厂还运用和发展了去年抓早、抓紧、抓具体的经验，从而实现了第一季度的月月红、满堂红。
