    Understanding the hearts of the people is the noble duty of every Communist Party member. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "An important sign of a good party member and a good leader is that he is familiar with the people's living conditions and working conditions, cares about the people's sufferings, and understands the hearts of the people; ... he consults with the masses when he has something to do, and the masses are willing to talk to him." (Political Report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party) The party members of Dongxiang County in Jiangxi Province understand this principle. They often talk with the masses to understand their voices, demands, and opinions. The masses regard the party members as confidants and turn to them for everything. They truly understand the hearts of the people.
    As everyone knows, any cause we communists undertake is a cause that is closely related to the masses and must rely on the masses' conscious efforts to complete. However, we cannot simply wait for the masses to become aware. Party organizations and party members must understand the hearts of the people, enlighten the masses, and explain the Party's policies. In our country, 600 million people's hearts are with the Communist Party and with the Party's great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and they want to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. This desire tightly connects 600 million hearts into one. Our Party deeply understands this heart and is now leading the people of the whole country step by step to realize their aspirations. However, people have universal and common demands, as well as their own individual and special demands. Therefore, party organizations and party members must listen to the voices of the masses and understand their hearts, so that they can address various opinions and solve their problems ideologically and practically. When Zong Gangsheng, a party member of Xiaohuang Commune in Dongxiang County, learned that commune member Song Shengbao had different opinions on the transformation of low-yield fields, he immediately led everyone in a discussion to address these different opinions, making everyone realize the benefits of transforming low-yield fields, and thus actively participate in the transformation of low-yield fields. It is evident that truly understanding the hearts of the people can enlighten and guide them based on their specific opinions, and lead them to take action.
    Understanding the hearts of the people should become increasingly deeper and more detailed. Because after the masses take action, practice will constantly present people with new situations and new problems, and people's thoughts will constantly change in the face of constantly changing situations. For example, some people's thoughts can adapt to the development of the situation, and therefore, they can firmly overcome the difficulties on the road ahead; some people's thoughts cannot adapt to the development of the objective situation, and they lack mental preparation in the face of the new situation, so they cannot firmly overcome the difficulties on the road ahead. At this time, party organizations and party members must often understand what new problems, new difficulties, and new ideological situations the masses have encountered in the new situation, understand the hearts of the people more deeply, then enlighten them again, raise their awareness again, and move forward again on a new basis.
    From this, it can be seen that understanding the hearts of the people is essential for leading the masses forward. To continuously lead the masses forward, it is necessary to continuously understand the hearts of the people, thereby guiding the people step by step along the path pointed out by the Party, so that our work improves and deepens step by step.
    In the process of contacting the masses, party members not only help the masses but also receive help from the masses. This is also of great significance for improving the level of party members and improving work. Party organizations in various places have already created many good methods. The practice of party members in Dongxiang County contacting households is one of the good methods. Party members can learn about the demands, opinions, and voices of each household and each person through household contact. At the same time, the contact between party members and the masses is relatively fixed and frequent, and mutual understanding will be greater and more profound. In Dongxiang County, the relationship between many party members and the masses is so close that they are like one family, which is a very good example.

    懂得人民群众的心
    怡清
    懂得人民群众的心，是每个共产党员的崇高义务。刘少奇同志说：“一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；……他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。”（党中央向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告）江西省东乡县的党员是懂得这个道理的，他们经常找群众谈心，了解群众的呼声、要求和意见，群众把党员当成知心人，有事都找党员谈，他们真正做到了懂得人民群众的心。
    大家知道，我们共产党人所进行的任何一项事业，都是群众切身的事业，也要依靠群众自觉的去完成。可是不能单纯等待群众的自觉，党组织和党员要懂得人民群众的心，要启发群众的觉悟，说明党的政策。在我们国家里，六亿人民的心向着共产党，向着党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，要多快好省地建设社会主义，这个要求把六亿颗心紧紧地连成了一颗心。我们的党是深深地懂得这颗心的，现在正在领导全国人民一步一步地实现自己的心愿。但是，人们有普遍的、共同的要求，也还有各自的、特殊的要求，所以，党组织和党员就要倾听群众的呼声，懂得他们的心，这样才能针对各种各样不同意见，从思想上和实际上解决他们的问题。东乡县小璜公社党员宗港生了解到社员宋生保对改造低产田存在不同意见时，立即针对不同意见，领导大家讨论，使大家认识到改造低产田的好处，从而积极参加改造低产田。可见，真正懂得群众的心，就能针对群众的具体意见启发、诱导，并领导群众行动起来。
    懂得人民群众的心，要越来越深入，越细致。因为群众行动起来以后，实践会不断向人们提出新的情况，新的问题，面对不断变化的形势，人们的思想也会不断发生变化。比如：有些人的思想能够适应形势的发展，因此，能够坚定地克服前进道路上的困难；有些人的思想不能适应客观形势的发展，在新的形势面前，缺少精神准备，就不能坚定地克服前进道路上的困难。这时，党组织和党员就要经常了解群众在新的情况中产生了哪些新的问题、新的困难、新的思想情况，更深地理解人民群众的心，再启发他们，再提高他们的觉悟，在新的基础上，再向前进。
    由此可见，懂得群众的心才能更好地领导群众前进，要不断领导群众前进，就要不断懂得群众的心，从而引导人民群众一步一步地沿着党所指引的道路前进，使我们的工作步步提高，步步深入。
    党员在联系群众当中，既帮助了群众，也得到了群众的帮助，对提高党员水平和改进工作，也有很大的意义。各地党组织已经创造了很多好办法，东乡县党员分户联系群众，就是好办法之一。党员可以通过分户联系，了解到每一户、每一人的要求、意见和呼声；同时党员和群众之间的接触比较固定和经常，相互之间的了解就会更多、更深刻。东乡县许多党员和群众之间的关系不分你我，亲如家人，这就是一个很好的例证。
