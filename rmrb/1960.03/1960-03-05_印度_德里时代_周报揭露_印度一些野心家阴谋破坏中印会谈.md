Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 4th: The latest issue of the Indian weekly "Delhi Times" published an editorial welcoming the upcoming meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru in April, and strongly condemned some extremely selfish and ambitious figures within and outside the Indian Congress for plotting to undermine the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks.

The editorial said, "We hope that the upcoming meeting (between the two Prime Ministers) will lead to happy results," but these people are not very happy about the talks. The editorial said, "If they are allowed to run rampant, India will be ruined," and Kripalani, the leader of the Praja Socialist Party, is one of them.

The editorial pointed out that they oppose the friendly meeting and reconciliation between the leaders of the two countries in order to achieve their ulterior motives, which is to alienate India and China, thereby mortgaging the present and future of Asian and African countries to foreign countries that have been ravaging Asia and Africa for years and centuries.

The editorial called on the people of India to rise up and smash their conspiracy.

According to the Indian Press Trust, Vinoba Bhave, the leader of the Indian "Land Gift Movement," said at a press conference held in Jurong on the 2nd that he welcomed Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to Delhi to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru. He said that the Himalayas are no longer a wall separating China and India. Bhave also criticized some people in India for threatening to hold demonstrations against Zhou Enlai. He said that this was an unwise step.

    印度“德里时代”周报揭露
    印度一些野心家阴谋破坏中印会谈
    新华社新德里4日电　最新一期的印度“德里时代”周报发表社论，欢迎周恩来和尼赫鲁即将在4月会晤，并且严词谴责印度会议内外一些极端自私的野心家阴谋破坏中印两国总理会谈。
    社论说，“我们希望即将举行的（两国总理）会谈将导致愉快的结果”，而这些人对会谈是不大高兴的。社论说，“如果任其横行，就将毁了印度”，而人民社会党首领克里帕拉尼就是其中的一个。
    社论指出，他们反对两国领袖友好地会晤，并且取得和解，是为了达到他们不可告人的目的，即离间印度和中国，从而把亚非国家的现在和未来抵押给这些年来和几百年来一直蹂躏亚非国家的外国。
    社论呼吁印度全国人民起来，粉碎他们的阴谋。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度“献地运动”领袖维诺巴·巴维2日在朱龙多举行的记者招待会上说，他欢迎中国总理周恩来即将来德里访问，同印度总理尼赫鲁会谈。他说，喜马拉雅山脉不再是隔开中印两国的一堵墙了。巴维也批评印度有些人扬言要举行示威反对周恩来。他说，这是不明智的步骤。
