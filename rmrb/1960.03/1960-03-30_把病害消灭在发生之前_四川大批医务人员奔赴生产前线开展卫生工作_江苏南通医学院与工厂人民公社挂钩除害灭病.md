Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 29th: Health departments in various parts of Sichuan Province are actively supporting spring plowing and production. Tens of thousands of health workers have gone to the forefront of production, working with commune members to vigorously improve sanitation in collective living areas, focusing on eliminating pests and diseases, to ensure that people are strong and horses are robust for spring planting.

Before the spring plowing season, health departments in various parts of Sichuan Province began training health workers and organizing medical teams to go to communes, construction sites, fields, and canteens to carry out health campaigns to eliminate pests and diseases. The Da County Special District trained more than 1,900 health workers and dispatched more than 5,800 medical personnel, organizing more than 1,500 mobile medical teams; in Kaijiang, Pingchang, Nanjiang and other places, medical personnel who went to the forefront of production have now reached 80%.

After these medical personnel arrived at the forefront of production, they generally adopted the method of dividing areas, assigning fixed points, and contracting responsibility, treating diseases, preventing diseases, publicizing spring health and epidemic prevention knowledge, and helping local cadres and commune members improve the cleanliness of collective living areas. In the Baishi Management Area of Shima Commune in the suburbs of Yibin City, all health personnel carried out prevention and treatment of diseases while conducting publicity. In a short period of time, 95.1% of the people in the entire management area underwent stool examinations, more than 80% were vaccinated against smallpox, and all malaria patients in the past three years were treated for relapse prevention. Medical and health personnel in various communes in Pixian County, led by the heads of commune hospitals, went to production teams as cooks, health workers, and commune members to help canteens improve cooking techniques and sanitation, help nursery staff master childcare knowledge, and improve the childcare and hygiene system; they visited commune members' homes to understand environmental sanitation conditions, investigated breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, and promptly mobilized commune members to manage them, which achieved good results.

Through the powerful organizational strength of the people's communes, health departments in various regions cooperated with spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation to mobilize the masses to carry out basic sanitation construction, eliminating diseases before they occur. This spring, Jiangjin County built more than 10,000 double-pit public toilets. This type of toilet is simple in structure, easy to store manure and seal, and can eradicate hookworms. Qionglai County's communes organized earthworkers, carpenters, and the masses to rush to repair canteens and toilets, adding a batch of sanitary equipment, ensuring that each canteen had a "separate stove," a water filtering sand jar, a gauze cover, and male and female bathrooms. This spring, Mianzhu County combined snail eradication with water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. Health workers, in coordination with commune cadres and the masses, adopted methods such as filling, excavating, burning, and using drugs to kill snails, repeatedly treating more than 8 million square meters of snail-infested areas throughout the county, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, filling many abandoned ditches, straightening bends, and opening some new ditches, expanding the cultivated area by about 10,000 mu.

Due to the focus on eliminating pests and diseases, and the vigorous efforts to improve the cleanliness of collective living areas such as canteens and nurseries, the spring health campaign has been very effective. In Pingwu County, a mountainous area in northern Sichuan, a mass campaign to eliminate pests and diseases was launched, focusing on collective living areas such as canteens, and the number of workers attending work regularly remained above 90%, with some areas reaching 98%. In many areas such as Nanchong County and Pingchang County, a large number of communes and management areas with no diseases and full production have emerged.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 28th: Nantong Medical College of Jiangsu Province, based on the characteristics of medical colleges, actively organized each class in the entire college to be linked with factories and people's communes respectively, establishing "health red flag areas" in these units or regions, popularizing health knowledge, and assisting the masses in carrying out health campaigns.

Each class in this college has now been linked with many units such as Wushan Commune, Dasheng Auxiliary Factory, Cotton Weaving Factory, Xinguang Road and Qixiu Road Residents Committee, and has formulated plans and measures based on investigations and visits. Under the unified leadership of the party organizations of the linked units, teachers and students often adopt various forms to conduct in-depth health publicity and education activities, help various units do a good job in eliminating pests and diseases, vigorously train various mass health care work backbones, and strengthen the health construction of factories and communes. Senior students, combined with clinical teaching, carry out various epidemic prevention and treatment activities in the "health red flag areas." Junior students focus on pest elimination and epidemic prevention, carrying out general epidemic prevention and treatment activities, creating conditions for entering clinical teaching. Each teaching and research group and each department of the affiliated hospital of the medical college, while actively participating in the activities of the "health red flag areas," combine their own specialties, vigorously carry out scientific research, tackle cutting-edge issues, and find the most effective technical measures to eliminate pests and diseases and improve the people's health level.

Many classes conducted health check-ups among residents and assisted in establishing a health care network. Recently, in coordination with Nantong City's patriotic health campaign, all teachers and students of the college fought in the rain in various "health red flag areas." In addition to eliminating a large number of rats, maggots, mosquito larvae, and overwintering mosquitoes and flies, they also thoroughly cleaned more than 7,000 toilets, garbage dumps, and other mosquito breeding grounds, filled more than 5,000 square meters of large and small pools, dredged more than 10,000 meters of dark ditches, fumigated more than 1,000 rooms, and conducted publicity activities in rural areas, factories, and neighborhood committees more than 15,000 times. They also carried out inspections of hookworm disease, malaria, and schistosomiasis in some areas.

The activity of Nantong Medical College linking with factories and communes to establish "health red flag areas" organically combines the emergency and regular, on-campus and off-campus, professional teams and mass movements in pest elimination and disease prevention work. At the same time, it also provides a good base for the school and affiliated hospital to further and comprehensively implement the party's education work and health work policies, improve the quality of teaching, prevention, and medical treatment, and strengthen the combination of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor.

    把病害消灭在发生之前
    四川大批医务人员奔赴生产前线开展卫生工作
    江苏南通医学院与工厂人民公社挂钩除害灭病
    新华社成都29日电　四川省各地卫生部门积极支援春耕生产，数以万计的卫生人员深入到生产第一线，同社员一起，以除害灭病为中心，大力搞好集体生活场所的卫生工作，保证人强马壮闹春播。
    四川省各地卫生部门早在春耕之前就动手培养训练卫生人员，组织医疗队伍，开赴各公社，深入工地、田间、食堂，开展除害灭病的卫生运动。达县专区训练了保健员一千九百多人，又出动五千八百多名医务人员组织了一千五百多个巡回医疗队；开江、平昌、南江等地的医务人员到生产第一线的，目前已达80％。
    这些医务人员到了生产第一线后，一般都采取了划片定点、包干负责的办法，有病治病、无病防病，宣传春季卫生防疫知识，帮助当地干部和社员群众搞好集体生活场所的清洁卫生。宜宾市郊区石马公社白石管理区全体卫生人员一边防治病疫，一边开展宣传，在短时间内，全管理区95．1％的人进行了粪便检查，80％以上的人接种了牛痘，对最近三年来的疟疾病患者全部作了抗复发治疗。郫县各公社的医务卫生人员，在公社医院院长率领下到生产队当炊事员、保健员和社员，帮助食堂改进烹调技术和清洁卫生工作，帮助保育人员掌握保育知识，健全保育卫生制度；在社员家了解环境卫生情况，调查蚊蝇等孳生场所，及时发动社员治理，收到很好的效果。
    各地卫生部门通过人民公社的巨大组织力量，配合春耕、积肥，发动群众大搞卫生基本建设，把病害消灭在发生之前。江津县今春大建双坑式公共厕所一万多个，这种厕所构造简单，便于贮粪、密封，可以根绝钩虫。邛崃县各公社组织土工、木工和群众，赶修食堂、厕所，增添了一批卫生设备，做到了每个食堂有“隔壁灶”、滤水沙缸、纱罩，有男女浴室。绵竹县今春把灭螺除害和水利建设、积肥运动结合进行，卫生人员协同各公社干部和群众，采取填塞、挖掘、烧毁和药物杀灭钉螺等办法，对全县八百多万平方米的有螺面积反复进行治理，积了大量肥料，填塞了不少废沟，去弯取直开了一些新沟，扩大耕地面积一万亩左右。
    由于以除害灭病为中心，大抓食堂托儿所等集体生活场所的清洁卫生，春季卫生运动收效很好。川北山区的平武县，以食堂等集体生活场所为中心，大搞除害灭病群众运动，出工人数经常保持在90％以上，一些地区达到98％。南充县、平昌县等许多地区还出现了大批无病疫、生产满堂红的公社和管理区。
    新华社南京28日电　江苏南通医学院根据医学院校的特点，积极组织全院各班分别与工厂、人民公社挂钩，在这些单位或地区内建立“卫生红旗区”，普及卫生知识，协助群众开展卫生运动。
    这个学院各班级现在已与五山公社、大生副厂、棉织厂、新光路和启秀路居民委员会等许多单位挂上了钩，并且在调查访问的基础上订出规划和措施。师生们在各挂钩单位党组织的统一领导下，经常采用多种形式，深入进行卫生宣传教育活动，帮助各单位做好除害灭病工作，大力训练各种群众卫生保健工作骨干，加强工厂和公社的卫生建设。高年级学生结合临床教学，在“卫生红旗区”内，开展各种疫病的预防、治疗活动，低年级学生以除害和做好疫病预防工作为主，开展一般疫病的防治活动，为进入临床教学创造条件。各教研组和医学院附属医院的各科室，在积极参加“卫生红旗区”的活动中，结合自己的专业，大搞科学研究，攻取尖端，找出最有效的除害灭病、增进人民健康水平的技术措施。
    许多班级在居民中进行了健康检查，协助建立卫生保健网。最近，配合南通市的爱国卫生运动，全院师生在各“卫生红旗区”冒雨作战，除消灭大量老鼠、蛆蛹、孑孓、越冬蚊蝇以外，还彻底清理了厕所、垃圾堆等蚊蝇孳生场所七千多处，填没大小水潭五千多平方米，疏通阴沟一万多米，烟熏房屋一千多间，深入农村、工厂、居委会进行宣传活动达一万五千多人次，还在部分地区进行了钩虫病、疟疾病和血吸虫病的检查工作。
    南通医学院与工厂、公社挂钩建立“卫生红旗区”的活动，把除害灭病工作中的突击和经常、校内和校外、专业队伍和群众运动等几个方面有机地结合起来。同时，也为学校和附属医院进一步全面贯彻党的教育工作和卫生工作方针，提高教学、预防医疗质量，为加强教学、科学研究、生产劳动三结合，开辟了良好基地。（附图片）
