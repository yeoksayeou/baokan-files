    Useless is Harmful, Used is a Treasure
    China Oil Factory Extracts More Than Twenty Important Raw Materials from Waste Gas
    (Reported by our newspaper) Shanghai China Oil Factory workers have extracted more than twenty important chemical raw materials, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and various lipid fragrances, from the waste gas of "oxidized paraffin."
    Last spring, in order to save oil for the country, the factory workers successfully trial-produced oxidized paraffin to replace oil. However, when oxidized paraffin was put into mass production, a harmful gas was emitted from the chimneys, which would irritate the skin upon contact and corrode metal equipment. The factory workers analyzed the composition of the oxidized paraffin waste gas and found that it contained valuable chemical raw materials such as formic acid and acetic acid. The Party branch called on everyone to resolutely recover the waste gas and vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization. Therefore, all the factory workers took action and, after many experiments, finally obtained more than twenty important chemical raw materials such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. Among them, formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids can be used as valuable pharmaceutical agents, solvents, and raw materials for the printing and other industries. Various lipid fragrances are important raw materials for the food industry. In the past, domestic production of these fragrances was not high, and most of them relied on imports. Shanghai needed nearly ten tons per month, while this factory can recover 9.5 tons of fragrances from the waste gas for every 100 tons of oxidized paraffin produced. After mass production, it can completely meet Shanghai's needs.

    不用是害  用了是宝
    中华油脂厂从废气中提出二十多种重要原料
    本报讯　上海中华油脂厂职工从“氧化石蜡”的废气中提取出甲酸、乙酸、丙酸、丁酸以及各种脂类香料等二十多种重要化工原料。
    去年春天，这个厂的职工们为了给国家节约油脂，试制成功氧化石蜡代替油脂。但是在氧化石蜡大批投入生产时，从烟囱里散发出来一种有害气体，人接触到会刺痛皮肤，金属设备碰到就会被腐蚀。这个厂的职工分析了氧化石蜡废气中的成分，发现有甲酸、乙酸等宝贵化工原料。党支部号召大家坚决回收废气，大搞综合利用。于是全厂职工纷纷行动起来，经过多次试验，终于取得了甲酸、乙酸、丙酸、丁酸等二十多种重要化工原料。其中甲、乙、丙、丁等酸类，可做贵重的药剂、溶剂及印刷等工业的原料。各种脂类香料，是食品工业的重要原料。这种香料过去国内生产不多，大部分靠进口，上海每月要用近十吨左右，而这家工厂每产一百吨氧化石蜡，可以从废气中回收九点五吨香料，大批生产后，完全能满足上海的需要。
