    Mother and Daughter
    Song Shaoming
    The bright moonlight illuminated the earth as if it were daytime. Baiyangdian Lake was like a clear, white mirror, so clean and bright.

    Ying'er returned from a meeting in the county, paddling her small boat, flying like a silver swallow. Under the moonlight, her plump face resembled a ripe apple, her dark, bright eyes like two pools of water, sweat soaked through her clothes, and her dark, short hair flew in strands…

    She reached the shore, moored the boat, and walked straight home. The sleeping village was peaceful and quiet. As she walked, she thought about what the secretary of the County Youth League Committee had said and planned what she should do tomorrow…

    Rounding the bend, she saw her house's window. Strange! On the bright window paper, the trembling figure of her old mother was still visible. How could her old mother, at her age, still be awake so late?

    Ying'er pushed open the half-closed fence gate and strode into the main room, where she saw piles of turnip stalks next to her mother. Her mother was picking at them, handfuls of turnip stalks jumping in front of her chest, her face, covered in spiderweb-like wrinkles, beaded with large drops of sweat. Ying'er asked:

    "Mom, where did you get these?"

    Her mother startled, hesitated for a moment before answering:

    "Just chopped them down today!"

    Ying'er's eyes flashed:

    "Did you get permission from the administrator?"

    "Not… yet…"

    "These things should be shared by everyone!"

    Ying'er's voice was stiff, her face alternating between white and purple. She thought: Mom has always been so easygoing, how can she value these little things so much? Humph, still has a selfish streak! Tears welled up in her eyes, and she turned and went out.

    Her mother knew her daughter had misunderstood. Humph, only when the truth comes out will you be happy! She picked at them, pile after pile, picked them all, put them in a basket, and carried them towards the garden.

    Administrator Old Man Fu Shun was watering, the waterwheel clanging. The ditches leading from the lake twisted and turned, like silver-white long chains. Ying'er's mother carried the basket of turnips to him and said:

    "Uncle Fu Shun, are you still not asleep?"

    "Not yet, aren't you asleep either?"

    "Sorry, I must have made you anxious!..."

    Old Man Fu Shun took a closer look and saw that she had picked the turnip stalks clean, and he smiled, stroking his goatee:

    "I was wondering where they went, so it was you..." He paused and said, "This time everyone can save some trouble, divide them up, and directly soak them in the jars..."

    After a few more words, Ying'er's mother went home. Her daughter hadn't returned yet, and she sighed with heartache: "Her heart is always set on the commune, always so proactive..." She tidied up a bit and went to sleep alone.

    A rooster's crow awakened Ying'er's mother. She opened her eyes and saw a cherry-red hue climbing up the window. She felt her daughter's bedding, empty: "Alas, being a Youth League branch secretary, you really need three heads and six arms..."

    The work bell rang. So many people on the street, young women and daughters-in-law, old men and old women… carrying nets, crowding towards the lake, chattering:

    "Haven't fished for forty days, this time we've really been holding back!"

    "The flood season just passed, the fish are nice and fat!"...

    At this moment, Sister-in-law Lao Biao from the front street came over, the person Ying'er's mother trusted most.

    "Oh my, I was wondering why the magpies were chirping so much, so it was you..."

    "Oh my, Sister, you know how much I've missed you!"

    They said affectionately, went into the house.

    After a few casual words, Sister-in-law Lao Biao leaned in to Ying'er's mother's ear and said in a hoarse voice, softly:

    "Sister, you're not someone who takes a copper coin for the moon, we have to leave a way out for the children. Ying'er holds an important role in the village, we can't be even a little bit selfish!" She paused, lowering her voice even further: "Ying'er said last night you..."

    Old Man Fu Shun suddenly came in. Last night, Ying'er's mother left the basket in the garden, and he came to return it, hearing the tail end of the conversation. He pressed:

    "What about last night?"

    Sister-in-law Lao Biao lowered her head and said nothing more. Old Man Fu Shun understood eight or nine tenths at a glance, so he said:

    "I know the whole story of last night, can't let a good heart be repaid with ingratitude!" Then, he told the whole story of the night before, vividly.

    Sister-in-law Lao Biao's eyes widened into straight lines after hearing it:

    "This, this was still Ying'er asking me to come! The child was afraid..." She poked Ying'er's mother with her hand: "You wretch, why didn't you say so sooner!"

    "No, I'm going to find Ying'er!" The old man said, walking out.

    Ying'er was leading people to fish. This area was a scene of boiling activity! Dozens of small boats, like a whirlwind, whizzing back and forth, this one dropping a large net with a swoosh, that one catching a big fish jumping on the net...

    "This one weighs at least three pounds!"

    "This one is guaranteed to be seven pounds!"

    On the shore, three cargo holds were already full!

    Old Man Fu Shun went straight to Ying'er, his voice like thunder:

    "You little girl, you're really bureaucratic!"

    Ying'er was stunned, and Old Man Fu Shun continued:

    "You wronged your mother, quickly go apologize..." Ying'er understood, just about to answer, when her mother threw a dark, blurry thing with a "whoosh." Her mother was panting:

    "Today you're fishing, how come you didn't tell your mother!" She pointed to the dark thing: "Use this new one..."

    Ying'er took a look, her mother had carried a net, looked very sturdy.

    "This..."

    "This is what your mother wove working at night!" her mother said.

    Ying'er was stunned, looked at everyone, and people's eyes converged on them. Looked at Uncle Fu Shun, the old man smiling contentedly; looked at her mother, standing straight and looking towards the red east, a clear wind blowing her white hair, strands of silver floating…

    What a beautiful morning, the colorful clouds dyed the earth, the earth reflected the blue sky, the whole world was a vibrant red, Baiyangdian was like a rose-colored silk, a cool breeze blowing, rippling with golden waves…

    母女
    宋绍明
    皎洁的月色，把大地照耀得像白昼一样。白洋淀像一面清白的大镜子，那么干净，那么明媚。
    映儿打县里开会回来，划着小船儿，像只银燕疾飞。月光下，她那丰润的脸膛像熟透的苹果，乌溜溜的大眼睛像两洼水，汗水浸透她的衣衫，黝黑的短发丝丝飞起……
    划到岸边，把船儿缆起，径直往家走去。酣睡的村庄，安详静谧。她走着，想着团县委书记的话，计划着明天该做的事……
    拐过胳膊肘弯，看到她家窗子。咦！明堂堂的窗纸上，还闪着老娘那颤巍巍的身影。老娘那把年岁，这么晚还没睡？
    映儿推开虚掩着的篱笆门，急步迈进堂屋里，见老娘身旁堆着一捆捆萝?梗子。老娘摘着，一把把的萝?梗在她胸前跳动，爬满蛛网似的皱纹的脸庞，滚着豆大汗珠儿。映儿问道：
    “妈，你这是哪儿来的？”
    老娘被吓得一颤，愕了会儿才答：
    “就今儿个劈下的！”
    映儿眼一忽闪：
    “通过管理员了么？”
    “还……没……”
    “这东西该大家分着吃才对！”
    映儿话音硬梆梆的，脸色一阵白一阵紫。她想：妈向来大大咧咧，咋这点玩艺儿倒放在眼里？哼，还有个自私根哩！她眼窝里浸着泪水，扭身出去了。
    老娘知道女儿误会了。哼，水落石出才让你欢喜哩！她一捆捆地摘着，摘着，摘完装进筐里，背着向园子走去。
    管理员福顺老汉正在浇水，水车叮儿叮儿作响。淀里引出的水沟弯弯曲曲，像一条条银白银白的长链子。映儿娘背着萝筐走到跟前，道：
    “福顺大爷，你还没睡？”
      “没哩，你也没睡？”
    “对不起，准让你着了急！……”
    福顺老汉临近一看，见她把萝?梗摘得净光光，抖动着山羊胡子笑了：
    “我说咋没哩，原来你……”停了停又说：“这回大家可省了事，分了，直接泡到缸里……”
    又拉扯几句，映儿娘才回家去。女儿还没回来，她心疼地叹口气：“一颗心挂在社里，总是那么积极……”又收拾收拾，独自睡了。
    一阵鸡啼把映儿娘吵醒，睁眼一望，一缕樱桃红色爬上窗子，一摸女儿的被窝儿，空空的：“唉，当个团支部书记，真该长三头六臂……”
    上工铃响了。街上这么多人呵，大姑娘小媳妇，老头老婆子……背着网，拥拥挤挤地向淀边走去，吵吵嚷嚷地说：
    “四十天没捞了，这回算憋足哩！”
    “汛期刚过，鱼儿正肥！”……
    这时，前街老表嫂走来了，这是映儿娘顶投心儿的人。
    “哎哟，我说喜鹊老叫哩，原来你……”
    “哎哟，大妹子，你知我多想你哩！”
    亲亲热热地说着，走进屋里去了。
    几句家常扯过去，老表嫂把嘴伸到映儿娘耳底，哑着嗓子，细声细语地：
    “大妹子，你可不是拿个铜钱当月亮的人，咱办事要给孩子留道儿，映儿在村上担着个重要角色，咱不能有半点儿自私！”停了停，把声音压得更低：“映儿说昨晚你……”
    福顺老汉忽地进来。昨晚，映儿娘把筐丢在园里，他赶来送筐的，听个话尾巴，追问道：
    “昨晚咋哩？”
    老表嫂低下头不再言语，福顺老汉一看就明白了八分，便道：
    “昨晚的事我可知底细，可不能拿片好心换个驴肝肺！”接着，哗哗地把昨晚的事情说了出来。
    老表嫂听完，两眼瞪成直棍儿：
    “这，这还是映儿托我来的哩！孩子怕……”她用手戳映儿娘一下：“个该死的，咋不早说哩！”
    “不成，我找映儿去！”老汉说着走出去。
    映儿在领着人捞鱼。这儿一片沸腾！几十只小船，像一股旋风，呼呼地卷来卷去，这儿刷拉拉罩下大网，那儿上网的跳着大鱼……
      “这条少说有三斤！”
    “这条保险有七斤！”
    岸边，三个舱早满啦！
    福顺老汉直奔映儿走去，开口像响雷：
    “你这丫头子真官僚主义！”
    映儿一怔，福顺老汉又说下去：
    “冤枉了你娘，快去赔礼……”映儿才明白，刚要答话，老娘“唿”地扔来个黑糊糊的东西。老娘气喘嘘嘘：
    “今儿个捞鱼，咋不肯跟娘说哩！” 她指那黑东西：“使使这新的……”
    映儿一看，娘背来的是网，看样子怪结实。
      “这……”
    “这是娘打夜作织的！”老娘说。
    映儿惊住了，望望大家，人们的眼光都汇聚在她们这里。望望福顺大爷，老汉笑迷迷地那么得意；望望老娘，直挺挺地望着红色的东方，清风吹拂着她的白发，飘起缕缕银丝……
    多么美好的清晨啊，彩霞漫染着大地，大地辉映着蓝天，漫天漫地红艳艳的，白洋淀上像铺上一块玫瑰色的绸子，清凉的风儿吹来，荡漾起金色的涟漪……
