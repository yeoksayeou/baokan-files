    Changde County Leaders Deeply and Meticulously Lead Spring Plowing
    Taking Grain as the Key Link to Comprehensively Arrange Labor, Vigorously Promote Tool Reform, and Improve Leadership Methods

    (Reported by this newspaper) Changde County, Hunan Province, plans to expand its cultivated land by 40,000 mu this year. Double-cropping rice will increase from 510,000 mu last year to 850,000 mu, striving to achieve an all-around leap forward in grain, cotton, pigs, and fisheries.

    In order to effectively implement the principle of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-around leap forward," the county party committee believes that the key lies in ensuring that the main battle line has sufficient labor (i.e., investing 70% to 80% of the labor force in agricultural production). How can production teams implement this decision? As early as mid-February, the county party committee organized cadres at all levels to go deep into the grassroots to investigate and solve problems as they were discovered. The first secretary of the Chongtian Commune Party Committee led the brigade and production team branch secretaries to concentrate on investigating the Hongzhuan Brigade for five days. They found that the brigade's labor was used in a dispersed manner, with an attendance rate of only 48% of the total population. Among the attending labor force, only 52% were engaged in grain production, 23% were engaged in animal husbandry, aquaculture, economic crops, and cash income, and 25% were engaged in living welfare. Due to the small amount of labor invested in grain production, tasks such as accumulating fertilizer and plowing fields were poorly done. The commune party committee decided to let the masses discuss and solve this problem. Finally, 266 laborers were drawn from various aspects to invest in grain production, and other industries were also rationally allocated. The experience of the Hongzhuan Brigade in deeply and meticulously solving problems was immediately promoted throughout the commune. All communes in the county also conducted such large-scale investigations, and labor was quickly arranged in accordance with the spirit of "taking grain as the key link."

    Although labor has been arranged, the contradiction of labor shortage brought about by large-scale production still exists. This requires vigorously carrying out tool reform. This year, it is necessary to transplant 520,000 mu of early rice (all planted with green manure) before and after the Grain Rain solar term. Relying on manual transplanting and old agricultural tools to turn over green manure fields will not be able to catch up with the season. The county party committee is determined to promote rice transplanters and reform green manure plowing tools. It has concentrated iron and woodworking craftsmen and plans to rush to manufacture 30,000 rice transplanters and train a large number of rice transplanter operators. In improving green manure plowing tools, it has proposed that cutting grass should be mechanized with rolling knives, plowing fields should be improved with double-shared plows, trampling and binding grass should be mechanized, and transportation should be mechanized with vehicles and boats, and lime spreading should be mechanized with tools. These tools have been improved and successfully trial-produced, increasing work efficiency by more than one time. Various communes have also improved transportation, processing, and cooking tools in many ways to free up labor for agricultural production.

    Through these methods, the county's labor shortage can be resolved.

### 常德县领导春耕深入细致  以粮为纲全面安排劳力，大抓工具改革，改进领导方法

    常德县领导春耕深入细致
    以粮为纲全面安排劳力，大抓工具改革，改进领导方法
    本报讯　湖南常德县今年计划扩大四万亩耕地，双季稻将由去年的五十一万亩扩大到八十五万亩，争取实现粮、棉、猪、渔全面跃进。
    为了切实执行“以粮为纲、全面跃进”，县委认为关键在于保证主攻战线有充足的劳力（即以70％到80％的劳力投入农业生产）。生产队如何贯彻执行这一决定呢？早在2月中旬，县委即组织各级干部，深入基层摸底，边发现问题，边解决。冲天公社党委第一书记带领大队、生产队支部书记集中在红专大队摸了五天底，发现这个大队劳力使用分散，出勤率只占总人数的48％，出勤劳力中搞粮食生产的只占52％，搞畜牧、水产、经济作物和现金收入的占23％，搞生活福利的劳力占25％。由于投入粮食生产的劳力少，积肥、翻田等工作作得很差。公社党委决定交由群众讨论解决这个问题，最后从各方面抽出了二百六十六个劳力投入粮食生产，其他各业也作了合理的调配。红专大队深入细致解决问题的经验立即在全公社推广。全县各公社也都通过这样大摸底、大调查，劳力很快根据“以粮为纲”的精神作了通盘安排。
    劳力虽然作了安排，但大生产带来劳力不足的矛盾仍然存在。这就需要大力进行工具改革。今年要抢在谷雨前后插完五十二万亩早稻（都种上了绿肥），凭手插秧，凭老农具翻绿肥田，怎样也不能赶上季节。县委决心推广插秧机，改革绿肥翻沤工具，集中了铁木工匠，计划赶造三万部插秧机和大量训练插秧机手；在改进绿肥翻沤工具上，提出了砍草滚刀化，翻田改良双铧犁化，踩钔草扎滚化，运输车船化，撒石灰工具化。这些工具都已改良试制成功，提高工效一倍以上。各个公社还从多方面改进运输、加工和炊事工具，以腾出劳力，投入农业生产。
    通过这些办法，全县劳力不足的困难可以得到解决。
