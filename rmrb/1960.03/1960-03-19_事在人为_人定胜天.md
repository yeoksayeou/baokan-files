	Where There's a Will, There's a Way; Humans Can Conquer Nature
	The people on both sides of the Dongliao River in Jilin Province have suffered greatly from floods in the past. Although the masses wished to control the water hazards, they could not realize this wish due to the lack of manpower in the past. With the establishment of the People's Communes, the commune Party committee issued a call to fundamentally control the Liao River. The vast majority of commune members actively responded to the call, but a few people were unconvinced. Someone said to Sun Baoqing, the Party branch secretary of the Eighth Production Team of the Wangben Management Area of the Shuangliao County Wangben People's Commune, "Old Sun, it's not like you don't know, during the puppet Manchuria era, landlords spent hundreds of silver dollars to build just one or two li of canals. Why should we bother with this?" Under these circumstances, Sun Baoqing did not waver. He thought, "What the Party committee said is right, 'Where there's a will, there's a way; humans can conquer nature.' Things that couldn't be done in the past can definitely be done today." So he said to the masses: Individual farming did not have the strength to build water conservancy projects and suffered from water damage. Primary cooperatives and advanced cooperatives built some water conservancy projects, and the whole village was able to harvest 400 to 800 shi of grain even in the case of serious floods. So with the People's Commune, if we build better water conservancy projects, won't we be able to increase grain production even more? Through the self-education of the masses, the broad masses further strengthened their confidence in doing a good job in water conservancy.
	A great water conservancy battle began. Sun Baoqing, like the commune members, fought day and night on the construction site. Finally, a gate was built at Qinghezui on the Liao River, and more than ten li of ditches were dug in the low-lying areas. Last year, the relentless flood of the Liao River poured down as usual, but due to the great role played by the water conservancy projects, agriculture was ensured a good harvest. Faced with this fact, people who were not very supportive of water conservancy in the first place also spoke up: "The power of the commune is greater than we thought; it has even subdued the Dragon King!"

    事在人为　人定胜天
    吉林省东辽河两岸的人们，过去饱受水灾的痛苦，虽然群众都有治理水害的愿望，但是因为过去人力单薄，没有实现这个愿望。人民公社成立了，公社党委提出了根治辽河的号召。绝大多数社员积极响应号召，可是有少数人思想没通。有人向双辽县王奔人民公社王奔管理区第八生产队党支部书记孙宝庆说：“老孙，你也不是不知道，伪满的时候，地主花了几百块现大洋才修上一、二里渠道，咱们又何必费这个劲呢。”在这种情况下，孙宝庆毫不动摇。他想：“党委讲的对，‘事在人为，人定胜天’，过去办不到的事，今天一定能够办到。”于是他向群众说：单干没有力量修水利工程，受了水害。初级社和高级社修了一些水利工程，全屯就在严重的水灾情况下，能打四百石到八百石粮食。那么有了人民公社，再修好水利工程，不是更能增产粮食吗？通过群众自我教育，广大群众进一步坚定了搞好水利的信心。
    一场水利大战开始了，孙宝庆和社员一样，日日夜夜的战斗在工地上。终于在辽河的清河嘴上修了闸门，在洼地里挖了十几华里沟渠。去年无情的辽河洪水又像往年一样倾泄下来，但是由于水利工程发挥了巨大作用，农业保住了丰收。面对这个事实，原先不大同意搞水利的人也说了话：“公社力量说不上有多大，连龙王爷都治服了。”
