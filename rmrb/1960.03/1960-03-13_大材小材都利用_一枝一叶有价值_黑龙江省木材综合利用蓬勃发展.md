Make Use of Big and Small Timber; Every Branch and Leaf Has Value
Heilongjiang Province's Comprehensive Timber Utilization Thrives

    (By our report) Comprehensive timber utilization in Heilongjiang Province is like a garden of colorful flowers blooming throughout the province's forest areas. After more than a year of development, it is now moving towards a forest product industrial base based on forest farm factory clusters, with modern enterprises as the backbone, a combination of large, medium, and small scale, with collaboration and division of labor, and reasonable distribution.

    Due to the initial adoption of a self-reliance and indigenous-foreign integration approach, comprehensive timber utilization in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province has greatly developed both the timber processing industry and the forest chemical industry, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

    In just over a year, the province's forestry system has established more than 700 small and medium-sized, indigenous-foreign integrated timber processing factories and forestry chemical factories. The variety of products has increased from twelve to fifty-nine, and the total output value has reached over 210 million yuan. New products such as fiberboard, pulp, paper, rosin, tannin extract, and oils have provided a large amount of raw materials for the building materials industry, light chemical industry, transportation, and mines.

    While vigorously developing comprehensive timber utilization, the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province have begun to transition from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups," from manual production to mechanized and semi-mechanized production; and from few products of low quality to many products of high quality. The Yidong Forestry Bureau in the Yichun forest area has built more than twenty small and medium-sized timber and forest chemical factories utilizing waste materials, forming a forest product industrial network where semi-finished products are produced on the mountain and refined products are produced at the foot of the mountain. At present, a new situation of great development, great construction, great improvement, and great leap forward in comprehensive timber utilization has emerged in the province's forest areas.

    The direct effect of comprehensive timber utilization in Heilongjiang Province is that it has opened up new avenues for fully utilizing forest resources and achieving rational forest management. Originally, only about 70% of the harvested timber could be utilized, with about 30% being unusable, either burned or discarded as "waste materials." According to the province's 1960 production of 15 million cubic meters of logs and 810,000 cubic meters of processed timber, there would be more than 4.4 million cubic meters of residual materials such as branches, cut-offs, slabs, and strips. If 60% of these residual materials could be utilized, it could replace more than 3.6 million cubic meters of good logs. This would play an extremely important role in supporting national economic construction.

    After the development of comprehensive timber utilization in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province, timber can now be "used for multiple purposes." The entire tree, including branches, trunk, bark, leaves, roots, and sap, can be used to produce over a thousand products through physical and chemical processing methods. Among the fifty-nine forest chemical products that have already been produced in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province, the fiberboard made from slabs, strips, and branches is known as "wood without defects." Furniture, wardrobes, sewing machine tabletops, ceilings, and partitions made from this wood are not only inexpensive but also strong, durable, and beautiful. The tannin extract extracted from the bark is also a very important raw material in the leather industry. Even sawdust, once it is utilized, can be used to manufacture bakelite, lamp holders, etc., with a quality no less than that of plastic.

    The development of comprehensive timber utilization in Heilongjiang Province has strengthened the connection between forestry and various sectors of the national economy. The fiberboard, rosin, alcohol, tannin extract, turpentine, etc., manufactured from the residual materials of timber harvesting and processing, will not only play an important role as raw materials for the light chemical and petroleum industries, but will also strongly support the development of agricultural production. According to calculations, if 24,000 tons of industrial alcohol and 6,000 tons of feed yeast are produced using wood chips as raw materials, 320 million catties of grain can be saved. At the same time, due to the development of comprehensive timber utilization, the small furniture, farm tools, and tools made from branches or cut-offs have also played a significant role in the tool reform of agriculture and basic construction.

    After more than a year of practice, the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province have found a way to develop comprehensive timber utilization in a faster, better, and more economical way. First, the guideline of having a center, a backbone, overall development, and a comprehensive leap forward was implemented. In the initial stage, each forest area first established small, indigenous-foreign integrated factory clusters centered on waste material processing; then gradually established timber processing plants and comprehensive forest chemical plants centered on timber processing, including the production of artificial boards. In terms of products, the focus was on timber substitutes, and the production of rosin, tannin extract, oil refining, pulp, paper, alcohol, etc., was comprehensively developed in accordance with local conditions. Second, comprehensive balance and proportionate development were carried out based on resource conditions. The guideline of overall consideration and comprehensive planning was implemented to achieve long-term management, rational layout, and processing on-site as much as possible. Third, the guideline of integrating indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, combining large, medium, and small enterprises, and gradually developing and improving was adhered to. The factory cluster in the Yidong Forestry Bureau forest farm required an investment of only more than 100,000 yuan, was built in two or three months, and has an annual output value of more than 400,000 yuan.

    大材小材都利用　一枝一叶有价值
    黑龙江省木材综合利用蓬勃发展
    本报讯　黑龙江省木材综合利用，有如万紫千红的花朵一样开遍全省林区；经过一年多的发展，目前正向着一个以林场工厂群为基础，以现代化企业为骨干，大中小结合，有协作分工，和合理布局的林产工业基地的方向发展。
    黑龙江省林区的木材综合利用，由于一开始就采取了自力更生、土洋结合的方针，使全省的木材综合加工工业和林产化学工业，像雨后春笋般地得到很大的发展。
    在一年多的时间里，全省林业系统已建立起中小型、土洋结合的木材加工工厂，和林业化学工厂达七百多处，品种由十二种增加到五十九种，生产总值已达二亿一千多万元，生产的纤维板、纸浆、纸、松香、栲胶、油脂等新产品，为建筑材料工业、轻化工业、交通运输和矿山提供了大量原材料。
    黑龙江省林区在木材综合利用大发展的同时，已经使开始由“小土群”发展起来的林场工厂向“小洋群”过渡，手工生产向机械化、半机械化生产过渡；由开始产品少、质量低向品种多、质量高的方向过渡。伊春林区的伊东林业局，兴建了二十多个中小型的利用废材加工的木材综合利用和林产化学工厂，形成了山上生产半成品，山下生产精制品的林产工业网。目前，全省林区已出现一个木材综合利用大发展、大建设、大提高、大跃进的新局面。
    黑龙江省木材综合利用的直接效果，为充分利用森林资源，实现林业合理经营，开辟了新的途径。原来采伐下来的木材，只能利用70％左右，有30％左右不能利用，或当做“废材”烧掉或扔掉。按全省1960年生产原木一千五百万立米，和加工成材八十一万立米计算，就有枝丫、截头、板皮、板条等余物四百四十多万立米。如果能利用这些剩余物的60％，就可代替三百六十多万立米的好原木。这对支援国家经济建设，将有极重要的作用。
    黑龙江省林区发展木材综合利用之后，使木材能够做到“一物多用”，整个树木包括枝、干、皮、叶、根、汁，经过物理和化学加工的方法，可生产千余种产品。现在黑龙江省林区已经生产出的五十九种林化产品中，有用板皮、板条和枝丫加工出来的纤维板，被人们称为“没有缺点的木材”。用这种木材做出来的家具、衣橱、缝纫机台板、天花板和隔板等，不仅价格便宜，而且又具有坚固、耐磨和美观的优点。从树皮中提炼出来的栲胶，在皮革工业中也是非常重要的原料。就是锯末一经被人利用起来，也能制造电木、灯头等，质量不亚于塑料。
    黑龙江省木材综合利用的发展，使林业和国民经济各部门的联系更加密切。依靠木材采伐和加工的剩余物，制造的纤维板、松香、酒精、栲胶、松节油等，不仅对轻化工业、石油工业都将起到重要原料的作用，而且将有力地支援农业生产的发展。据计算，如果以木屑作原料生产工业用的酒精二万四千吨、饲料酵母六千吨计算，就可以节省粮食三亿二千万斤。同时，由于木材综合利用的发展，利用枝丫或截头做的小型家具、农具和工具，对农业、基本建设的工具改革，也起了很大的作用。
    黑龙江省林区经过一年多的实践，找到了一条多快好省发展木材综合利用的道路。首先是贯彻了有中心、有骨干、全面发展、全面跃进的方针。在开始阶段，各林区先建立以废材加工为中心的小型的土洋结合的工厂群；而后逐步建立以木材加工为中心，包括人造板生产的木材综合加工厂和综合性林产化学工厂。在产品上是以代用木材为中心，因地制宜地全面发展松香、栲胶、炼油、纸浆、纸、酒精等生产。其次，根据资源情况搞好综合平衡、按比例发展。贯彻统筹兼顾、全面规划的方针，做到长远经营、合理布局，尽可能就地加工。第三，坚持了土洋并举，中小型为主，大中小结合，逐步发展逐步提高的方针。伊东林业局林场的工厂群，投资仅十多万元，两三个月就建成了，年产值达四十多万元。
