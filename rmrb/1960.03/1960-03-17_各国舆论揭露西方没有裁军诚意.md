    International Opinion Exposes Western Lack of Sincerity in Disarmament
    "Soviet Russia": The West Rehashes the Old Tune of Collecting Military Intelligence to Replace Disarmament
    "Labor News": The United States Continues to Expand Military Preparations in Order to Evade the Solution of the Disarmament Problem
    Hungarian "People's Freedom": The Western "Disarmament Plan" is a Step Backward Compared to the Old Plan
    Polish "People's Tribune": The West Abandons Specific Obligations and Pushes Disarmament into a Vague Future
    British "Daily Worker": The Western Plan Attempts to Avoid Taking Any Actual Disarmament Measures

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 16th - Today, "Soviet Russia" published an article commenting on the "Disarmament Plan" formally announced by Western countries on the 15th. The article said that in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly's unanimously approved decision on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee should formulate practical methods for achieving complete and thorough disarmament in the shortest possible time, and the participants of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee should contribute to the resolution of this issue. However, the "new" plan proposed by the West cannot but lead people to the conclusion that someone is attempting to delay genuine disarmament and make this important issue fall into endless discussion. The article said that these facts cannot but raise vigilance.

The article pointed out that the "Disarmament Plan" published by Western countries is a rehash by Western diplomats and military personnel of the old tune of replacing disarmament with the collection of military intelligence. The article said that the purpose of this plan is primarily to establish an international monitoring organization to collect intelligence materials related to troop equipment, military expenditures, and so on. The article said that even elementary school students understand that what is being discussed here is not the monitoring of disarmament, but something else with ulterior motives.

The article pointed out that the Western "Disarmament Plan" is very vague when it comes to the issue of disarmament. The plan makes no mention of the date of disarmament, but is obsessed with establishing so-called international armed forces. The article said that this is fundamentally inconsistent with the intention of genuine disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th - Romanian, Hungarian, and Polish newspapers today published commentaries on the issue of disarmament, pointing out that the Western countries, led by the United States, lack the sincerity to resolve the disarmament issue.

The Romanian "Labor News" commentary said that the "Cold War" spirit in the West has not dissipated, and there are still considerable forces in the West obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue. The commentary pointed out that from a series of facts, such as the Bonn government's conspiracy to establish military bases abroad, the United States' attempt to escape the constraints of not conducting nuclear weapons tests, and the continuous increase in military budgets in capitalist countries, it can be clearly seen that there are still many obstacles on the road to complete and thorough disarmament. The commentary condemned U.S. Secretary of State Herter for obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue. The commentary pointed out that Herter advocates establishing supervision without disarmament, and he even advocates continuing to expand military preparations. The commentary pointed out that proposing such a proposition is to evade the solution of the disarmament problem.

The Romanian "Youth Spark News" commentary pointed out that the Western countries, led by the United States, lack sincerity towards complete and thorough disarmament.

The Hungarian "People's Freedom" commentary pointed out that judging from the disarmament plan drafts proposed by both sides, the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee cannot be said to be easy. The commentary said that the West's new "Disarmament Plan" not only did not approach the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, but also took a step backward compared to the original British "Disarmament Proposal" aimed at prolonging disarmament. The commentary pointed out that the Western plan does not stipulate a time for disarmament, and at the same time continues to put the issue of supervision before the issue of disarmament, which will undoubtedly hinder the smooth progress of the Geneva talks.

The Polish "People's Tribune" published a commentary pointing out that the "Disarmament Plan" jointly proposed by Western countries before the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference is a disappointing document. The commentary said that it is difficult to call this plan a disarmament plan. It is in fact abandoning any specific obligations and pushing disarmament into a "vague future." The commentary said that the West's "Disarmament Plan" has not advanced the possibility of disarmament by even a single point.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 16th - Today's "Daily Worker" editorial sharply criticized the Western disarmament plan, saying that the Western proposals do not proceed from the current situation in the world, but indulge in empty talk about the future situation in outer space. The editorial pointed out, "Doing so seems to be an attempt to avoid taking any practical disarmament measures, which will lead to as much empty talk as possible and as little action as possible."

The editorial emphasized, "It is of course important that nuclear weapons should not be placed in space stations to intimidate the world, but we would be much safer today if we could dismantle American missile launch sites, eliminate American bombers carrying hydrogen bombs already circling over our heads, and eliminate the prospect of German (West German) fighter jets and bombers doing the same."

### 各国舆论揭露西方没有裁军诚意

    各国舆论揭露西方没有裁军诚意
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”：西方重弹收集军备情报来代替裁军的老调罗“劳动报”：美国继续扩军备战是为了回避裁军问题的解决匈“人民自由报”：西方“裁军计划”比过去老计划还要后退一步波“人民论坛报”：西方抛开具体义务而把裁军推到渺茫的未来英“工人日报”：西方的方案企图避免采取任何实际的裁军措施
    新华社莫斯科16日电　“苏维埃俄罗斯报”今天发表文章，评西方国家15日正式公布的“裁军计划”。文章说，根据联合国大会一致赞同的关于全面彻底裁军问题的决定，十国裁军委员会应在最短期内订出实现全面彻底裁军的实际办法，十国裁军委员会参加者应对解决这个问题作出贡献。然而，西方提出的“新”计划不能不使人得出结论：有人在企图拖延真正的裁军，企图使这一重要问题陷于无休止的讨论。文章说，这些事实不能不使人引起警惕。
    文章指出，西方国家公布的“裁军计划”是西方外交家和军人重弹要用收集军备情报来代替裁军的老调。文章说，这个计划的目的首先是要建立一种国际监督组织，来收集有关部队装备、军事支出等情报材料。文章说，连小学生也明白，这里谈的并不是监督裁军而是完全别有用心，另有企图。
    文章指出，西方的“裁军计划”在涉及到裁军的问题时含意十分模糊。在这个计划中对裁军的日期只字未提，可是对建立所谓国际武装部队却念念不忘。文章说，这根本不符合真正的裁军意图。
    新华社15日讯　罗马尼亚、匈牙利和波兰的报纸今天就裁军问题发表评论，指出以美国为首的西方国家没有解决裁军问题的诚意。
    罗马尼亚“劳动报”的评论说，西方的“冷战”精神并没有消散，在西方还存在着相当的阻挠解决裁军问题的势力。评论指出从波恩政府阴谋在国外建立军事基地、美国企图摆脱不进行核武器试验的约束、资本主义国家的军事预算不断增加这一系列的事实中可以清楚地看出，在全面彻底裁军的道路上还存在着许多障碍。评论谴责美国国务卿赫脱阻挠裁军问题的解决。评论指出，赫脱主张建立没有裁军的监督，他甚至主张继续扩军备战。评论指出，提出这种主张是为了回避裁军问题的解决。
    罗马尼亚“青年火花报”的评论指出，以美国为首的西方国家对全面彻底的裁军缺乏诚意。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”的评论指出，根据双方提出的裁军计划草案看来，十国裁军委员会的工作并不能说是轻松的。评论说，西方的新“裁军计划”不但没有接近苏联的全面和彻底裁军的建议，而且比原先英国提出的旨在拖长裁军时间的“裁军建议”还要退后一步。评论指出西方的这一计划没有规定裁军的时间，同时继续把监督问题放在裁军问题之前，毫无疑问，这会阻碍日内瓦谈判的顺利进行。
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表的评论指出，西方国家在十国裁军会议之前联合提出的“裁军计划”是个令人失望的文件。评论说，很难把这个计划叫作裁军的计划。它事实上是抛开任何的具体义务并把裁军推到“渺茫的未来”。评论说，西方的“裁军计划”没有把裁军的可能性向前推进一分。
    新华社伦敦16日电　今天“工人日报”的社论尖锐地抨击西方的裁军方案说，西方的建议不从现在世界上的形势出发，而空谈外层空间的未来情况。社论指出，“这么做看来是企图避免采取任何实际的裁军措施，这将使空谈尽量多而行动尽量少。”
    社论强调指出，“不应把核武器放在空间站来威吓世界，这当然是重要的，但是如果我们能够取消美国的导弹发射场，取消载着氢弹已经在我们头顶上盘旋的美国轰炸机以及消除德国（西德）战斗机和轰炸机也这么做的前景，那么今天我们就会安全得多了。”
