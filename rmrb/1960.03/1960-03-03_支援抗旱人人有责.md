Zhengzhou Workers Rush to Build Water Pumps
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting on February 26th with responsible cadres from various factories, mines, enterprises, and schools to implement the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on combating drought and irrigating wheat. The meeting called on the entire party and all the people to take immediate action with the greatest determination, concentrating manpower and resources to support the rural drought resistance struggle.
    Many factories and enterprises, in accordance with the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee's instructions, launched a mass movement to support drought resistance and wheat irrigation while mobilizing their workers. Workers at Zhengzhou Heavy Machinery Plant expressed their determination to support drought resistance. Repairman Niu Banghu said, "Supporting drought resistance is everyone's responsibility. I will strive to be among the first to go to the countryside and repair machines for drought resistance." Through ideological education, supporting drought resistance has become a driving force for production in this factory. By February 24th, the plant had completed the assembly of 100 diesel engines for the month five days ahead of schedule and had made preparations for March, ensuring the production of 200 twenty-horsepower diesel engines in March, doubling the February output. They also plan to complete the production of the 500 water pumps planned for the first quarter half a month ahead of schedule. The city's finance and trade, culture, and education systems also extensively explained the situation and the importance of supporting drought resistance to their employees. The commercial bureau system dispatched purchasing agents to expedite the procurement of drought relief materials, and various companies cleared their warehouses, sending water pumps, electric motors, and gas lamps to the front lines of drought resistance.

Guangdong Troops Repair Reservoirs
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in various parts of Guangdong have been actively mobilizing in recent days to enthusiastically help the local people's communes vigorously carry out drought resistance and spring plowing.
    After soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Bao'an County and members of the Buji Commune found a spring, they immediately took the initiative to suggest to the local Party committee that a reservoir be built. With the approval of the local Party committee, they quickly surveyed the terrain, determined the dam site, and began construction. The soldiers declared: the people's difficulties are our difficulties! We will not withdraw until the drought resistance struggle is victorious!
    On Hainan Island, where spring plowing started earlier, stationed troops helped communes plant large areas of green rice seedlings. In the Wenchang and Tunchang areas, troops recently helped plant 867 mu of rice, and accumulated and delivered 5,500 dan of fertilizer. Soldiers of a certain unit in the Leizhou Peninsula have been working alongside commune members in the fields for days, sowing a total of 1,366 mu, and also planting more than 1,000 mu of sugarcane.
    Troops stationed in the Shantou area have contributed more than 330,000 workdays to the communes. Sixteen of the eighteen water conservancy projects supported by the troops have been completed ahead of schedule, ensuring irrigation for more than 600,000 mu of land for spring plowing.

Shaanxi Scientific Community Helps Solve Drought Resistance Technology
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Under the call of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee for "the entire party and all the people to urgently mobilize to overcome the drought," a technical investigation team composed of scientific and technical forces has gone deep into the countryside to assist farmers in fighting the drought.
    The investigation team was initiated by the Provincial Science and Technology Association, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Provincial Department of Water Resources, and invited scientific and technical workers in agriculture, water conservancy, meteorology, botany, soil, and other fields to participate. After arriving at Yangling Commune in Xingping County, the investigation team adopted the method of visiting, holding discussions, inspecting, and summarizing experience to jointly discuss with commune members the solution to prominent technical problems in the current drought resistance. These areas are located on the high Yuan and Erdao Yuan, dozens of zhang high, making the task of drought resistance more arduous, but the commune members have set up camp on the fields and are doing everything possible to bring water to the Yuan to achieve a bumper harvest. The enthusiasm of the masses has greatly encouraged all members of the investigation team. They are determined to use scientific and technical forces to assist the masses in overcoming the drought.
