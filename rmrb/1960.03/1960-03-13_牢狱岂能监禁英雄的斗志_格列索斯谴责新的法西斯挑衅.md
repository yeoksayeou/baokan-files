    Prison Cannot Confine the Heroic Will
    Glezos Condemns New Fascist Provocations
    In a letter to the Secretariat of the International Organization of Journalists, he pointed out: The Western imperialist bloc is incorrigible. The resurgence of Nazi elements is the result of the policy pursued by global monopoly capital groups.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 12th. The Secretariat of the International Organization of Journalists has received a letter from Greek national hero Manolis Glezos, who is imprisoned in the Averoff prison in Athens. In this letter, Glezos condemns the recent new fascist provocations and attacks on democracy that have occurred in some European countries.
    Glezos wrote in the letter that the blatant painting of swastikas and the outbreak of anti-Semitic incidents are a warning to all people with democratic beliefs, to all who have suffered under Nazism and Fascism. Glezos said that it would be a sad mistake if we did not fully recognize the scale and meaning of the newly launched Nazi movement. The threat to democracy is serious because the resurgence of Nazi elements is the result of policies pursued by monopoly capital groups around the world.
    Glezos wrote that the Western imperialist bloc is incorrigible. They are using Hitler's "anti-Bolshevism" slogan to launch the Cold War, support West German remilitarization, and reinstate various war criminals.
    Glezos said that in Greece, anti-fascist fighters are persecuted, the spirit of national resistance is suppressed, while brutal war criminals are pardoned or secretly released. People who were injured and disabled in the struggle against fascism have been held in prisons and concentration camps for ten or even fifteen years. Freedom of the press and freedom of association are being deprived.
    Glezos finally expressed his gratitude to the people of all countries for protesting the Greek authorities' arrest and sentencing of Greek democrats.

    牢狱岂能监禁英雄的斗志
    格列索斯谴责新的法西斯挑衅
    他在给国际新闻工作者协会秘书处的信中指出：西方帝国主义集团是顽固不化的。纳粹分子的卷土重来是世界垄断资本集团奉行的政策的结果。
    新华社布拉格12日电　国际新闻工作者协会秘书处接到了被关在雅典阿维罗夫监狱的希腊民族英雄格列索斯的一封信。格列索斯在这封信中谴责最近在一些欧洲国家中发生的新的法西斯挑衅和对民主的进攻。
    格列索斯在信中写道，对于一切具有民主信念的人，对于一切曾经在纳粹主义和法西斯主义统治下受苦受难的人来说，肆无忌惮地涂卐字标记和反犹事件的爆发是一个警告。格列索斯说，如果我们不充分认识最近发动的新纳粹运动的规模和含义，这将是可悲的错误。民主所面临的威胁是严重的，因为纳粹分子的卷土重来，是世界各地垄断资本集团奉行的政策的结果。
    格列索斯写道，西方帝国主义集团是顽固不化的，他们利用希特勒提出过的“反布尔什维克主义”口号来发动冷战，支持西德重新军国主义化，并使各种战犯重新上台。
    格列索斯说，在希腊，反法西斯战士受到迫害，民族抵抗精神受到镇压，而残暴的战犯却获得赦免或者被私下释放。在反对法西斯的斗争中受伤和残废的人们被关在监狱和集中营里达十年，甚至十五年之久。新闻自由和工会自由都被剥夺。
    格列索斯最后对世界各国人民抗议希腊当局逮捕和判决希腊民主人士的行动表示感谢。
