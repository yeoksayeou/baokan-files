After watching the performance of the Chongqing Branch of the Sichuan Provincial Finance and Trade Workers' Amateur Art Troupe, we were not only greatly encouraged but also greatly surprised. This amateur art troupe from the finance and trade front has been established for less than a year, but in a short period of time and in addition to their busy work, they have created more than a hundred artistic programs that are timely, coordinate with political tasks, and are humorous and moving. These programs are all self-written, self-directed, and self-performed by them, using various artistic forms and giving full play to the power of collective creation.

The programs they performed praised the new people and new deeds in the Great Leap Forward, especially the new people and new deeds of "doing good things for the people's communes." For example, "The Pig-Raising Girl" is one of the excellent programs performed in response to the Party's call. It not only promoted pig-raising very well but also reflected the struggle between old and new ideas between a mother and daughter. The mother disliked the dirtiness of raising pigs and was unwilling for her daughter to take on the pig-raising work; however, due to the daughter's strong will and after the persuasion of the masses, the daughter finally got her wish. Another example is the group of young people in "The Song of the Purchasing Agent," who traveled all over the country to purchase materials to meet the needs of the people, showing their firm confidence and optimism in the performance. Furthermore, the new relationship between people in the new type of people's canteen reflected in the dance "Before the Opening" is so kind and beautiful. It is also worth mentioning the satirical ballad "American Satellite Upside Down," which used Sichuan's unique funeral gongs and drums and humorous singing, recitations, and performances to send off war peddlers and the culprit Eisenhower, making the entire audience laugh and feel relieved.

Another characteristic of this amateur art troupe is the particularly strong performance quality of the programs. According to the audience's preferences, they made good use of the traditional performing movements of opera and folk art forms to express the content of the programs. For example, the performances of the male chorus "Chasing Pigs in the Moonlight" and the female chorus "Hejiang Lychee" have very novel movements, making people feel particularly cordial and vivid, as if they were on the scene. They have loud and melodious voices, and their expressions are so rich and natural. Especially in some programs, the unexpected addition of a sentence or two of enlightening dialogue or special sound effects immediately brings the audience to the real world, which is particularly interesting.

In terms of tune creation, the ten or so comrades among them who write more are very talented. They are relatively bold in adapting folk tunes and creating new tunes, often breaking through the original forms and structures of folk songs or traditional tunes to make them meet the needs of new life content and new requirements. For example, several Sichuan Qingyin programs they performed, which were originally relatively fixed and musically strong with very beautiful tunes, were not directly copied. Large sections of Sichuan Qingyin such as "Xu Xuehui" and "The Pig-Raising Girl" have been adapted and enriched in terms of melody, and the original performance form of Sichuan Qingyin has been broken through in the singing, combined more with performance, making the singing full of drama. Actors Wang Zhengdong and Tang Yinglan (they are both employed staff) can sing and perform, sing excellently, and perform in an orderly manner. They are very talented.

Here, I would like to especially mention the creation of lyrics. In the programs they perform, many lyrics sparkle with the author's political enthusiasm and artistic imagination and expressive power between the lines. It can be seen that they are working hard to learn from the excellent traditions of Sichuan folk literature and have gained some results.

The Chongqing Branch of the Sichuan Provincial Finance and Trade Workers' Amateur Art Troupe is one of the tens of thousands of amateur art troupes in our country. They have become a strong amateur art troupe mainly because they listen to the Party, put politics in command, liberated their minds, dared to think and act, and dared to create. What is even more valuable is that they are not satisfied with the achievements they have made and have lofty ambitions to cultivate more amateur artistic talents for creation and performance, and strive to better promote the Party's central work through artistic forms.

It is hoped that they will further learn from the excellent traditions of Sichuan's rich operas, folk songs, and folk arts. While consolidating the existing foundation and maintaining the characteristics of amateur art troupes, they should learn more from professional and amateur groups across the country, strive to popularize and improve, and we believe that they will be able to make greater achievements.

    一支强有力的业余文艺队伍
    ——四川省财贸职工业余文工团重庆分团演出观后
    吴一立
    看了四川省财贸职工业余文工团重庆分团的演出之后，我们不但受到了很大的鼓舞，同时也感到很大的惊奇。这个财贸战线上的业余文工团成立还不到一年，但在短短的时间和紧张的工作之余，他们却创作出了一百多个能及时配合政治任务而又风趣动人的文艺节目。这些节目都是他们发挥了集体创作的力量，利用多种多样的文艺形式自编、自导、自演出来的。
    他们演出的节目歌颂了全民大跃进中的新人新事，特别是“为人民公社大办好事”的新人新事。如“养猪姑娘”就是响应党的号召演出的优秀节目之一，它不仅很好地宣传了养猪，而且反映了一对母女之间新旧思想的斗争。母亲嫌养猪肮脏，不愿女儿担任养猪工作；由于女儿的意志坚强，并经过群众的说服，最后使女儿如愿以偿。又如“采购员之歌”里的一群青年，为了满足人民的需要，不辞辛劳地跑遍全国采购物资，演出中充分表现了他们坚定的信心和乐观主义精神。再如舞蹈“开堂之前”所反映的新型的人民食堂里人与人之间新的关系，是那么亲切、美好。更值得一提的是讽刺说唱“美国卫星倒栽葱”，它对战争贩子和罪魁艾森豪威尔用了四川特有的送葬锣鼓和富于幽默感的歌唱、道白和表演给美帝国主义送葬，使全场观众大笑不已，人心为之一快。
    这个业余文工团的另一特点是节目的表演性特别强。他们按照观众的喜爱，很好地运用了戏曲和曲艺的传统表演动作来表现节目的内容，如男声小合唱“月夜赶猪”、女声小合唱“合江荔枝”等节目的表演都有很新颖的动作，使人感到特别亲切、生动，宛如身临其境。他们有着响亮悦耳的歌喉，他们的表情是那样丰富、自然，特别是在有的节目中意外地加了一句半句画龙点睛的说白或特殊的音响，立即把观众带到真实的境界，更是别饶风趣。
    在曲调创作上，他们中间的十来位写作较多的同志都是很有才能的。他们在改编民间曲调和创作新曲调上都比较大胆，常常能突破民歌或传统曲调的原有形式和结构，使它符合新的生活内容的需要和新的要求。如他们演出的几首原是比较定型而音乐性强、曲调非常美的四川清音节目也不是照搬的。像大段子四川清音“徐学惠”、“养猪姑娘”等，都在曲调上有所改编、有所丰富，而且在演唱上又突破了四川清音原有的表现形式，更多地结合了表演，使演唱富于戏剧性。演员王正栋、唐应兰等（她们都是在职员工）能唱能演，唱得出色，演得有条不紊。她们是很有才能的。
    这里要特别提一下歌词的创作。在他们演出的节目中，有很多歌词在字里行间闪烁着作者政治热情的火花，和富于艺术想像描绘的表现力。看得出他们是在努力向四川民间文学的优良传统学习，并有了一定收获的。
    四川省财贸职工业余文工团重庆分团是我们国家里数以万计的业余文工团中的一个。他们能成为一支强有力的业余文艺队伍，主要是由于听党的话，政治挂了帅，解放了思想，敢想敢作，勇于创造的结果。更可贵的是他们并不满足于已经取得了的成绩，而且还有远大的壮志雄心，要培养出更多的创作和演出的业余文艺人才，争取通过文艺形式更好地宣传党的中心工作。
    希望他们更进一步地向四川丰富的戏曲、民歌和曲艺的优良传统学习。在巩固现有的基础和保持业余文工团特色的同时，更多地向全国各专业和业余团体学习，努力普及，努力提高，我们相信，他们一定能够做出更大的成绩。
