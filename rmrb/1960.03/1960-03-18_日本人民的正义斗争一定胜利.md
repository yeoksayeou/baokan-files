Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee Secretariat today sent a telegram to the Japanese Peace Committee, forwarding it to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," firmly supporting the Japanese people's 13th national action to oppose the Diet's approval of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The telegram stated:

　　As the Japanese people from all walks of life are holding the 13th national unified action to oppose the Diet's approval of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee extends its heartfelt greetings to the Japanese people who are persevering in their struggle to defend peace, and expresses its full support for the just struggle of the Japanese people.

　　The people of the Asian and Pacific regions and countries around the world are eagerly hoping that the international tension will ease, opposing war, and demanding peace. However, the U.S. war clique is violating the strong wishes of the people of the world, intensifying international tensions everywhere, and preparing for new wars of aggression. The Japanese government's attempt to quickly approve and implement the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the Diet further exposes the collusion between U.S. war forces and Japanese militarist forces, conspiring to prepare new wars of aggression in Asia. The people of the Asian and Pacific regions resolutely oppose the U.S. aggressive policy and resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarist forces with U.S. support and their renewed harm to the people of Asian countries. They will join hands with the Japanese people, strengthen solidarity, and continue to work hard to defend the peace and security of the region and the world, and to jointly fight to defeat the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war.

　　We wish the Japanese people success in their 13th national unified action!

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The China Peace Committee and the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity today sent telegrams to the Japanese Peace Committee, the Japanese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and forwarded them to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," firmly supporting the Japanese people's 13th national unified action to oppose the Diet's approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The telegram stated:

　　At a time when the Japanese people are holding a massive 13th national unified action to oppose the Diet's approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the China Peace Committee and the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, on behalf of the Chinese people, firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and against the revival of militarism, and warmly wish you success and victory in this action.

　　U.S. imperialism is stepping up its war preparations and aggression activities, and the Kishi Nobusuke group, colluding with the United States, is also stepping up preparations to implement the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, accelerating Japan's nuclear armament and militarization, and has recently repeatedly issued aggressive clamors hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, openly clamoring to include our territory of Jinmen and Mazu within the scope of application of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. This ferocious war preparation activity of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, which endangers Japan and threatens Asian peace, cannot but arouse even stronger resistance from the broad masses of the Japanese people, and cannot but arouse great anger and opposition from the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries.

　　The Japanese people's 13th national unified action marks the continued development of the Japanese people's great, just, and patriotic movement. Glory and victory will surely belong to the heroic Japanese people who are fighting for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

    日本人民的正义斗争一定胜利
    日本阻止批准日美“安全条约”第十三次全国统一行动即将开始
    亚太和会、我国和大与亚非团结委员会致电日和平团体表示支持
    据新华社17日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处今天致电日本和平委员会转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约举行第十三次全国行动。电文说：
    值此日本各界人民为反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约而举行第十三次全国统一行动之际，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会谨向为保卫和平坚持奋斗的日本人民衷心致意，并表示对日本人民正义斗争的完全支持。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界各国人民，都热烈希望国际紧张局势走向和缓，反对战争，要求和平。但是，美国的战争集团却违反世界人民的强烈愿望，到处加剧国际紧张局势、准备新的侵略战争。日本政府企图迅速在国会批准并实施日美军事同盟条约，就更进一步揭露出美国战争势力和日本军国主义势力互相勾结，在亚洲准备新的侵略战争的阴谋，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民坚决反对美国的侵略政策，坚决反对日本军国主义势力在美国扶持下复活并重新祸害亚洲各国人民。他们将同日本人民一道，加强团结，继续努力，为保卫本区域和世界的和平与安全，为击败帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋，共同奋斗。
    敬祝日本人民第十三次全国统一行动的成功！
    据新华社17日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会，今天致电日本和平委员会、日本亚非团结委员会并转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对国会批准新的日美“安全条约”举行第十三次全国统一行动。电文说：
    在日本人民为反对国会批准新的日美“安全条约”举行声势浩大的第十三次全国统一行动时，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会代表中国人民，坚决支持日本人民为反对日美军事同盟、反对军国主义复活的正义斗争，并热烈预祝你们这次行动的成功和胜利。
    美帝国主义正加紧进行备战和侵略活动，和美国勾结一起的岸信介集团也在加紧准备实施日美军事同盟条约，加速日本的核武装和军国主义化，并在最近一再发出敌视中、苏和亚洲国家的侵略叫嚣，公然叫嚷把我国领土金门、马祖划入日美军事同盟条约的适用范围。美日反动派这种穷凶极恶、危害日本、威胁亚洲和平的备战活动，不能不激起广大日本人民更加强烈的反抗，不能不激起中国人民和亚洲各国人民极大的愤怒和反对。
    日本人民第十三次全国规模的统一行动，标志着日本人民的伟大的正义的爱国运动正在继续开展。光荣和胜利必将属于为独立、民主、和平和中立而斗争的英勇的日本人民。
