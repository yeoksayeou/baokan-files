Burmese Farmers Welcome Chinese Rice Transplanters
    Xie Lifu

    The news of the Chinese rice transplanter's demonstration at the Maubin Model Farm in Burma has caused a sensation throughout Burma. In particular, the Burmese farmers who toil diligently in the fertile rice fields all year round were overjoyed and came to visit one after another. In recent days, the Maubin Farm has received thousands of guests from all over Burma.

    On March 7, the two rice transplanters presented to the Burmese government by Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, made their first demonstration at the Burmese state-owned Maubin Model Farm. General Ne Win, Prime Minister of Burma, Foreign Minister U Chan Tun Aung, Brigadier General Aung Gyi, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burmese Army, and dozens of senior officials and agricultural experts attended the ceremony.

    Burma is an agricultural country known for its rice production, with 16.8 million acres of arable land (one acre equals 6.07 mu), of which 10.4 million acres are rice fields. For thousands of years, Burmese farmers have been transplanting rice by hand, bending over with their backs arched. Because rice cultivation requires a lot of manual labor, and because the rice-growing areas are concentrated, labor is particularly tight during the transplanting season. Burmese farmers have long been struggling to solve this problem. That's why the appearance of Chinese rice transplanters in Burma has been warmly welcomed. These Chinese rice transplanters are not only the crystallization of the Chinese people's innovation in agricultural technology, but also carry the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Burmese people. This will undoubtedly have an important significance in promoting the exchange of agricultural production experience between the two countries and consolidating the friendly relations between the two countries.

    The two rice transplanters given to Burma by China this time are both products of the Great Leap Forward in China in 1958. One of them is called "Hunan Liling No. 2", which was invented by He Jisheng, a member of the Qingshui River People's Commune in Liling County, Hunan Province. This machine is simple in structure, lightweight, low in cost, and highly efficient. One person pushing it can replace five laborers, and it can transplant three to four mu in ten hours. It is widely popular in the rice-growing areas of southern China and is very popular among farmers. He Jisheng, the creator of this rice transplanter, personally gave a demonstration for the audience here.

    The other one, called "Nanjing No. 105 Type B," was created collectively by the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute. It is pulled by livestock and can transplant 25 mu in ten hours, which is 25 to 30 times more efficient than manual transplanting.

    Using mechanical transplanting is a groundbreaking new thing in Burma. After two technicians and several Burmese farmers cooperated to carry out a successful demonstration performance, it was warmly applauded by Prime Minister Ne Win and all the audience. They believed that these two rice transplanters were very suitable for Burma's needs. The Burmese farmers unanimously praised them. A farmer named U Na Myaung, who was about forty years old, watched He Jisheng operate the "Hunan Liling No. 2" rice transplanter he invented with ease, continuously and evenly inserting seven tufts of rice seedlings into the soil. He said enviously to a farm woman holding a child, "This kind of rice transplanter is simple and practical, and it is very beneficial to our farmers." The Burmese woman replied, "This machine can also be used by our women. Getting used to it will not only increase production, but also free people from the suffering of bending over." A seventy-year-old Burmese man who had traveled dozens of miles to visit, touched the rice transplanter donated by China, looked at it again and again, touched it again and again, and was reluctant to let go. Finally, he said, "This gadget is too good. It can reduce our labor and save our working time, which is the best thing for us farmers."

    U Tun Wan, chief engineer of the state-owned farm, also praised it repeatedly, saying: "The biggest advantages of the 'Hunan Liling No. 2' rice transplanter are its simple structure, lightweight, cost-effectiveness, and high efficiency. As long as it is promoted in Burma, farmers will definitely like it. For a country like Burma, which is rich in timber, each of these rice transplanters will only cost 20 kyats (Burmese currency), so everyone can have one."

    Chinese rice transplanters have also aroused widespread interest in the Burmese media. Major Burmese newspapers have reported the successful demonstration of Chinese rice transplanters with prominent pages, including both pictures and texts. Many newspapers have also published commentaries and editorials. Editorials in the English-language "Guardian" and "Burma New Times" said that the promotion of Chinese rice transplanters in Burma would be an extremely important revolution in Burmese farming methods. They also said that in Burma, transplanting rice is a tiring job, which has always been done by rural girls and women, so the two machines donated by China will be warmly welcomed by Burmese farmers. The Burmese-language "Times" said: "We can imitate this kind of rice transplanter, so it is a good gift for an agricultural country like Burma."

    Recently, the Burmese Department of Agriculture, the Rural Development Corporation, and the Agricultural Implement Factory jointly held a meeting and decided to promote Chinese rice transplanters on a large scale. They plan to manufacture 1,500 units in the first batch, and also hold two training courses, and then promote them to various places together with the machines and people. Agricultural experts here estimate that if Chinese rice transplanters are widely promoted in Burma, at least 40 to 50 million labor days can be saved each year. This is a very practical help for the Burmese people. (Picture attached)

    缅甸农民欢迎中国插秧机
    解力夫
    中国插秧机在缅甸茂边模范农场表演的消息，轰动了整个缅甸，特别是终年在肥沃的稻田里辛勤劳动的缅甸农民，更是喜出望外，纷纷前来参观。近日来，茂边农场接待了数以千计的来自缅甸各地的客人。
    3月7日，中华人民共和国刘少奇主席赠送给缅甸政府的两台插秧机，在缅甸国营茂边模范农场作了首次表演。这一天，缅甸总理奈温将军，吴千吞昂外交部长，缅甸陆军副总参谋长昂季准将及几十位高级官员和农业专家们都出席了这个仪式。
    缅甸是一个产稻米著称的农业国，全国一千六百八十万英亩耕地（一英亩合六点零七市亩），其中一千零四十万英亩是稻田。千百年来缅甸农民都是弯腰曲背地用手插秧，因为水稻的栽培使用人工多，再加上水稻种植区集中，所以每到插秧季节，劳动力就显得特别紧张。缅甸农民一直苦于无法解决这个问题。正因为这样，中国插秧机在缅甸出现，受到了热烈的欢迎。这些中国插秧机不仅是中国人民在农业技术革新方面创造的结晶，而且带着中国人民对缅甸人民的深厚友谊。这无疑对于促进两国的农业生产经验的交流和巩固两国之间的友好关系，有着重要的意义。
    这次中国送给缅甸的两台插秧机，都是1958年我国大跃进的产品。其中有一台叫做“湖南醴陵2号”，是湖南省醴陵县清水江人民公社社员贺继生发明的。这台机器，构造简单，轻便，成本低，效率高，一个人推动可以代替五个劳动力，十小时内能插秧三亩到四亩，它在中国南方水稻区普遍流行，很受农民欢迎。创造这种插秧机的贺继生，在这里亲身为观众作了示范表演。
    另一台叫“南京105号B型”，是南京农业机械化研究所集体创造的。它是用畜力拉的，每十小时能插秧二十五亩，比人工插秧的效率高二十五倍到三十倍。
    使用机械插秧，在缅甸来说，还是破天荒的新事，当两位技术人员和几位缅甸农民合作进行了成功的示范表演之后，受到了奈温总理及全体观众的热烈鼓掌欢迎。他们认为这两台插秧机非常适合缅甸的需要。缅甸的农民们更是一致称好。一个年约四十岁上下的农民吴纳貌，当他看到贺继生轻便自如地操纵着他自己发明的那台“湖南醴陵2号”插秧机，一连把七撮秧苗连续不断地、均匀地插在泥土上的时候，羡慕地对一个抱着小孩的农妇说：“这种插秧机既简单又适用，对我们农民很有好处。”那个缅甸妇女回答说：“这种机器我们妇女也可以使用，用惯了一来可以提高生产；二来可以让人们不再受那弯着脊背的苦楚了。”一个特地从数十里外赶来参观的七十多岁的缅甸老人，抚摸着中国赠送的插秧机，看了又看，摸了又摸，总舍不得离手，最后他说，“这个玩艺儿太好了，它能减轻我们的劳动，又能节省我们的工作时间，这对我们农民来说，是再好也没有了。”
    国营农场的技术总工程师吴吞旺也赞不绝口地说：“‘湖南醴陵2号’插秧机最大的优点是构造简单，轻便，省钱和功效大，只要在缅甸一推广，保准农民会喜欢它。像这样的插秧机，在盛产木材的缅甸来说，每架只要花二十元（缅币）就可以人手一架了。”
    中国插秧机在缅甸舆论界也引起了广泛的兴趣。缅甸的主要报纸都以显著的版面，图文并茂地报道了中国插秧机成功表演的消息。其中不少的报纸还发表了评论和社论。英文“卫报”和“缅甸新时代报”的社论说，中国插秧机在缅甸推广，这在缅甸的耕作方法上将是一项极为重要的革命。它们还说，在缅甸，插秧是一种累人的工作，这向来是由农村姑娘和妇女们干的，因此，中国赠送的这两台机器将受到缅甸农民的热烈欢迎。缅文“时代报”说：“这种插秧机，我们可以仿造，因此对于像缅甸这样的一个农业国来说，它是一件好的礼物。”
    最近缅甸农业局、乡村发展公司和农具制造厂联合举行了会议，决定大量推广中国插秧机。他们计划首批制造一千五百台，还举办两个训练班，然后连机器带人一块儿到各地推广。这里的农业专家们估计，如果中国插秧机在缅甸普遍推广后，每年至少可节省四千万到五千万个劳动日。这对缅甸人民来说，是一项非常实际的帮助。（附图片）
