Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 27th: The great, nationwide technological innovation and technological revolution movement has brought about earth-shaking changes to the appearance of enterprises, the face of production, and the spirit of the masses of workers in Chongqing. The city has seen a new situation of better, comprehensive, and continuous leap forward this year.

Chongqing's comprehensive technological innovation and technological revolution movement, centered on semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation, has rapidly expanded from industrial, basic construction, and transportation departments to agriculture, finance and trade departments, schools, hospitals, government agencies, the military, and even street residents since it began in November last year, sweeping across all sectors of the city. 90% of the masses in the city have been involved in this movement. The content of technological innovation includes both production and life aspects, encompassing both general innovations and cutting-edge technologies. It has also developed from single-item tool and operational improvements to systemic and comprehensive reforms in all aspects such as equipment, product design, and process routes. The scale, scope, speed, and momentum of this movement have surpassed the mass movement of large-scale steel production in 1958.

Since the city's workers and masses have engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution, the appearance of enterprises has undergone tremendous changes. In the past three months, more than 45,000 manual operations in the city's industrial, basic construction, and transportation sectors have been semi-mechanized and mechanized, and more than 9,800 single machines have been semi-automated and automated. The number of production automatic lines and linked lines has reached 1,380. Due to the large-scale realization of "four transformations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation), the degree of mechanization in the city's industrial and mining enterprises has rapidly soared from 32.2% to the current 57.1% in just over three months, an average increase of 2.2% every ten days. Especially after the Harbin on-site meeting, the increase in the degree of mechanization has been even more significant, with an average increase of 4.24% every ten days. This has greatly changed the situation in the city's factories and mining enterprises, where there was a lot of manual labor and a low degree of mechanization. At the same time as the leap in the degree of mechanization in factories and mining enterprises, the appearance of enterprise management has also greatly improved, and the level of technical management, planning management, and other aspects in all walks of life has been significantly improved. This movement has also brought about a new look in agriculture, finance and trade, culture and education, and other departments. For example, the grain processing sector, which mainly relied on manual operation in the past, now has a mechanization rate of 98%. Twenty-two of the twenty-five grain stations have achieved full mechanization. More than 300 livestock farms in the city's agricultural sector have achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization.

Under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the beginning of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, all walks of life directed the spearhead of this mass movement towards breaking through the key and weak links in production. As a result, the city's production level has increased rapidly, and production plans have been completed very well. From January 1st to March 24th, the total industrial output value already completed in the city has increased by 65.7% compared to the same period last year. The problem of labor shortage in the city's comprehensive and continuous leap forward this year has been basically solved due to the improvement of mechanization and automation. The industrial front in the city has saved more than 69,000 laborers.

In this great movement, people's mental outlook has also undergone profound changes. The broad masses of people have greatly liberated their minds, greatly developed their wisdom, overcome difficulties, tackled cutting-edge technologies, and created miracles. They found materials themselves if they didn't have them, learned techniques themselves if they lacked them, and built equipment themselves if they didn't have it, displaying a highly tenacious spirit of overcoming difficulties. Yang Zejun, a fitter at the Chongqing Radio Factory, was determined to make an automatic program controller. He ran to more than a dozen bookstores and libraries, flipped through more than 1,000 books, and finally succeeded after more than 100 experiments. In the movement, the broad masses of people also greatly promoted the spirit of mutual cooperation and collectivism. If one person or one unit had difficulties, everyone came to help. They actively carried out innovation themselves and actively helped others to innovate. Chen Xingfu, a worker at the Chang'an Machinery Factory, not only implemented 600 innovation proposals himself in the movement and converted 36 machine tools into automated and semi-automated ones, but also helped others implement more than 5,000 innovations and improved 55 machine tools. This communist spirit of the working class and the broad masses of people in the city has become a powerful driving force for promoting the development of production and technological revolution.

In carrying out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, Chongqing has gained many successful experiences. The first is to combine production, comprehensively plan, organize battles, and carry out mass movements on a large scale. Under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, all units in the city, after a period of airing views and debates, unanimously recognized that this movement must directly serve production. In order to achieve this goal, all departments and units in the city, in carrying out the movement, carefully ranked the weak links and key issues in the current production, made comprehensive plans, and guided the spearhead of the mass movement to break through the weak links and complete and overfulfill production tasks. When formulating plans, all units proceeded from actual conditions, setting both long-term plans and short-term plans; grasping both general innovations and high-end, sophisticated technologies; and ensuring both widespread efforts and key breakthroughs, so as to continuously improve the level of production technology through technological innovation and technological revolution movements in a directed, planned, led, and organized manner. In the planning, all walks of life put forward the focus of the movement in response to the high proportion of manual operations and the shortage of labor. Before December last year, the proportion of manual operations in the city's factories, mines, basic construction, and transportation systems accounted for 67.8%. These manual operation areas have great potential and are often weak links in production. All walks of life seized this major key, carried out large-scale semi-mechanization and mechanization of manual operations, which played a significant role in saving a lot of labor, rapidly improving labor productivity, ensuring the completion of production tasks, and realizing this year's leap forward plan. In the planning, in addition to the "four transformations," all factories and mining enterprises also comprehensively carried out innovations in response to production characteristics and other major key issues. For example, steel plants also vigorously carried out hot blast alkaline iron furnaces, multi-loading and rapid smelting, electric furnace mixed steelmaking, and extending furnace life; coal mine systems vigorously carried out four-eight cross operations; and the power industry sector comprehensively promoted "four-in-one" ring power supply, etc. After the plan was formulated, the first method adopted by all walks of life in organizing the implementation was: deploying every few days, inspecting every few days, dividing into several stages, making demands, organizing battles, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. For city-wide key issues, the city's strength was organized to fight an annihilation war; for plant-wide key issues, the plant's strength was organized to fight an annihilation war. The city's promotion of "four-in-one" ring power supply was originally planned to be fully realized by the end of the second quarter. In this movement, after comprehensive planning and comprehensive mobilization to fight an annihilation war, it was basically realized in only twenty days.

Secondly, in the implementation of the plan, the Municipal Party Committee also uniformly led all units and organized city-wide cooperation. In the great cooperation, the boundaries of industries were broken, the circles of factories were jumped out of, helping each other, supporting each other, greatly accelerating the realization of the plan, and promoting the development of the movement. For example, in the large-scale mechanization of loading and unloading at docks and stations, the city organized 21 machinery factories to fight together with the transportation department, and the phenomenon of picking and carrying was basically eliminated within a week. In the process of organizing the implementation of the plan, all units also fully mobilized the masses to carry out activities to summarize and promote advanced experiences. General experiences were summarized by the masses themselves, major experiences were grasped by the leadership themselves, and a three-way combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians was adopted to systematically summarize and promote them within a limited time. This not only promoted the accelerated realization of the innovation plans of all walks of life, but also enabled production to achieve a large-scale harvest.

With the deepening development of the movement, after the degree of mechanization and automation increased, a series of new problems appeared in enterprise management. For example, as work efficiency improved, more stringent requirements were placed on the organization and supply of raw materials. After the degree of mechanization and automation increased, it was required to classify and adjust the original products, organize fixed and large-scale production; it was required to adjust labor organization and revise quotas; it was required that workers master new production technologies, etc. In response to the above problems, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized and led all factories and mining enterprises to comprehensively strengthen enterprise management. Among them, it focused on grasping the four major links of technical management, equipment transformation and product design innovation, planning management, and adjustment of labor organization. The center of strengthening technical management is to grasp technical procedures. The scientific research institutions in the city and the teachers and students of major colleges and universities formed ten professional groups, went to factories and mines to help workers conduct technical operation summaries. All factories and mines also adopted the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and engineering technicians to summarize the advanced experience of the masses and incorporate it into technical procedures in a timely manner. As of March 23, the city has summarized and finalized 11,892 "four transformations" projects. The Chang'an Machinery Factory established a special organization to inspect and evaluate the innovation and creations of the masses in the movement, summarized and improved them in a timely manner, incorporated them into the process plan, and formulated typical cutting specifications according to the same type of machine tools and the same type of parts. Up to now, the plant has revised 2,708 procedures, consolidated the achievements of the technological revolution, and promoted the universal improvement of the level of production technology. In terms of equipment transformation and product design innovation, on the one hand, after the degree of automation of equipment increases, product standardization is required, which requires classifying all parts of the product and making the parts standardized and universal; on the other hand, the new achievements of the technological revolution must be absorbed in product design to simplify the product structure and make the product more perfect. Many factories and mining enterprises are currently carrying out this work. Many factories and mining enterprises have also strengthened planning management, organized new balances based on the advanced factors appearing in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and adjusted labor organization in a timely manner. The labor saved has been transferred to strengthen weak links, form professional teams, support the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and organize training to support new units. The improvement of management work has played an important role in promoting technological innovation and technological revolution movement and the improvement of production.

    重庆技术革命推动持续跃进
    90％群众投入机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化的热潮
    机械化程度由32．2％飞升到57．1％；工业总产值比去年同期增长65．7％
    据新华社重庆27日电　伟大的、全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经使重庆市的企业面貌、生产面貌和职工群众的精神面貌，起了翻天复地的变化，全市今年出现了更好的全面持续跃进的新形势。
    重庆市以半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化为中心的全面的技术革新和技术革命运动，从去年11月份揭开序幕以来，迅速从工业、基本建设和交通运输部门扩展到农业、财贸部门、学校、医院、机关、部队，一直到街道居民，席卷了全市各行各业；全市90％的群众都投入了这一运动。技术革新的内容，既包括生产方面，又包括生活方面，既有一般革新，也有尖端技术；并从单项的工具、操作上的改进，发展到整个设备、产品设计、工艺路线等各个方面的系统、全面的大改革。这次运动的规模之大、范围之广、速度之快、来势之猛，都超过了1958年大办钢铁的群众运动。
    全市职工群众大搞技术革新和技术革命以来，企业面貌发生了巨大变化。三个多月来，全市工业、基本建设和交通部门，已有四万五千多项手工操作实现了半机械化和机械化，九千八百多台单机实现了半自动化和自动化，出现的生产自动线和联动线达一千三百八十条。由于“四化”的大量实现，全市工矿企业的机械化程度很快由三个多月前32．2％飞升到目前的57．1％，平均每十天提高2．2％。尤其在哈尔滨现场会议开过以后，机械化程度的上升更为显著，平均每十天提高4．24％。这样，就大大改变了全市厂矿企业手工笨重劳动多、机械化程度低的面貌。同厂矿企业机械化程度飞跃提高的同时，企业管理的面貌也大为改观，各行各业的技术管理、计划管理等水平，都显著提高了。这个运动同样使农业、财贸、文教等部门出现了崭新的面貌。如过去主要用手工操作的粮食加工部门，现在机械化的程度已经达到98％。二十五个粮站中，已有二十二个实现了全盘机械化。全市农业部门已有三百多个畜牧场实现了半机械化和机械化。
    在中共重庆市委的领导下，技术革新和技术革命运动一开始，各行各业就把这个群众运动的矛头引向突破生产关键和薄弱环节，因而全市的生产水平飞快提高，生产计划完成得很好。从1月1日到3月24日止，全市已经完成的工业总产值，比去年同期增长了65．7％。今年全市全面继续跃进中出现的劳动力紧张的问题，由于机械化、自动化程度的提高，已经基本解决。全市工业战线节约出的劳动力已达六万九千多人。
    在这个伟大的运动中，人们的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。广大群众思想大解放，智慧大发扬，大破难关，大攻尖端，大创奇迹。没有材料自己找，缺乏技术自己学，没有设备自己造，发挥了高度顽强的克服困难的精神。重庆无线电厂钳工杨泽君，立志要制成一部自动程序控制仪，跑了十多个书店和图书馆，翻了一千多本书，经过一百多次试验，终于获得成功。在运动中，广大群众还大大发扬了互相协作精神、集体主义精神。一人、一个单位有困难，大家都来帮助；自己大闹革新，同时积极帮助别人革新。长安机器厂工人陈兴富在运动中，不但自己实现了六百项革新建议，把三十六台机床改为自动化、半自动化，同时帮助别人实现五千多项革新，改进了五十五台机床。全市工人阶级和广大群众的这种共产主义精神，成了推动生产和技术革命运动向前发展的强大动力。
    在开展技术革新和技术革命运动中，重庆市取得了许多成功的经验。首先是结合生产、全面规划、组织战役、大搞群众运动。在中共重庆市委领导下，全市各单位经过鸣放辩论，一致认识到这项运动必须直接为生产服务。为了达到这个目的，全市各部门、各单位在开展运动中，都把当前生产中的薄弱环节和关键问题加以细致排队，进行全面规划，把群众运动的矛头引导到突破薄弱环节，完成和超额完成生产任务。在制定规划的时候，各单位都从实际情况出发，既定长期规划又订短期规划；既抓一般革新，又抓高大精尖；既要遍地开花，又要重点突出，以便有方向、有计划、有领导、有组织地通过技术革新和技术革命运动，不断提高生产技术水平。在规划中，各行各业都针对手工操作比重很大和劳动力不足的情况，提出了运动的重点。去年12月份以前，全市厂矿、基本建设、交通系统手工操作的比重占67．8％。这些手工操作的地方存在着很大的潜力，也往往是生产中的薄弱环节。各行各业抓住这一重大关键，大搞手工操作半机械化和机械化，对大量节约劳动力，迅速提高劳动生产率，保证完成生产任务，实现今年的跃进计划，起了重大作用。在制定规划中，除“四化”以外，各厂矿企业还针对生产特点和其它重大关键，全面进行革新。如钢铁厂还大搞热风碱性化铁炉、多装快炼、电炉混合炼钢和延长炉子寿命；煤矿系统大搞四八交叉作业；电业部门全面推广“四合一”环形供电等。规划订出以后，各行各业在组织实现当中，首先采取的办法是：几天一部署，几天一检查，分几个阶段，提出要求，组织战役，大搞群众运动。凡是全市性的关键问题，就组织全市力量打歼灭战；全厂性的关键，就组织全厂力量打歼灭战。全市推广“四合一”环形供电，原计划要在第二季度末才全部实现。这次运动中经过全面规划，全面动员打歼灭战，只花了二十天就基本上实现了。
    其次，在实现规划中，市委还统一领导各单位，组织了全市大协作。在大协作中，打破了产业界限，跳出了工厂的圈子，互相帮助，互相支援，大大加速了规划的实现，推动了运动的发展。如大搞码头、车站装卸机械化中，全市组织了二十一个机械厂同运输部门一起奋战，在一个星期内就基本消灭了挑抬的现象。在组织实现规划过程中各单位还充分发动群众大搞总结和推广先进经验的活动。一般经验依靠群众自行总结，重大经验领导亲自掌握，采取领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合办法系统总结，限期推广。这样，既促使了各行各业的革新规划的加速实现，又使生产实现了大面积丰收。
    随着运动的深入发展，机械化、自动化程度提高以后，在企业管理工作方面出现了一系列的新问题。如工效提高了，对原材料的组织供应提出了更加严格的要求。机械化、自动化程度提高以后，要求把原有产品分类、调整，组织定型的、大批的生产；要求调整劳动组织和修订定额；要求工人掌握新的生产技术等等。中共重庆市委针对以上问题，组织领导各厂矿企业全面加强了企业管理工作。其中着重抓紧了技术管理、设备的改造和产品设计的革新、计划管理、调整劳动组织这四大环节。加强技术管理的中心是抓技术规程。市里的科学研究机构和各大专学校的师生组成十个专业小组，分头到厂矿帮助工人进行技术操作总结。各厂矿也采取领导干部、工人和工程技术人员三结合的方法，总结群众的先进经验，及时纳入技术规程。到3月23日止，全市已总结定型的“四化”项目达一万一千八百九十二项。长安机器厂成立了专门的组织，对运动中群众的革新创造，进行了检查鉴定，及时加以总结提高，纳入工艺规划，并按同类机床、同类零件，制订出典型切削规范。到目前为止，全厂已经修订规程二千七百零八项，巩固了技术革命的成果，促进了生产技术水平的普遍提高。在设备的改造和产品设计的革新方面，一方面是设备的自动化程度提高以后要求产品定型，这就需要把产品的全部零件分类归口，使零件标准化、通用化；另一方面，在产品设计上必需吸取技术革命的新成果，简化产品结构，使产品更趋完善。目前不少厂矿都在进行这一工作。许多厂矿企业还加强了计划管理，根据技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的先进因素，组织新的平衡，并及时调整劳动组织。节约出的劳动力，已抽调出来加强薄弱环节，组成专业队伍，支援技术革新和技术革命运动，和加以组织训练，支援新单位。管理工作的改进，对推动技术革新和技术革命运动以及生产的提高，起了重要作用。
