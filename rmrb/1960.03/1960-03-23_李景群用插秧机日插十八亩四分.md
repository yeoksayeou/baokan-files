Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 22nd. "A hero uses a hero's machine, like a fierce tiger with wings," Li Jingqun, a rice planting expert famous in Guangxi last year, learned to use a rice transplanter this year and created a new record of planting 18.47 mu per day.

Li Jingqun is a female member of the Xin'di Commune in Cangwu County and a Communist Party member. Last year, she set the highest record for manual rice planting in the autonomous region with a yield of 3.76 mu per day. This year, she participated in a rice transplanter training class in the county. After diligent study and hard work, she mastered the operating techniques of the rice transplanter. At the beginning of spring planting, she taught four or fifty women how to use rice transplanters while also continuously studying techniques to improve her rice planting efficiency. On March 17, she used a Guangxi 59-3 type rice transplanter to plant 18.47 mu in twelve hours, all in 6×4 spacing, which was praised by the director of the prefectural women's federation and the secretary of the commune party committee who participated in the acceptance.

    李景群用插秧机日插十八亩四分
    新华社南宁22日电　“英雄人用英雄机，好似猛虎添双翼”，去年广西闻名的插秧能手李景群，今年学会使用插秧机，又创造了日插十八亩四分七厘的新纪录。
    李景群是苍梧县新地公社的女社员，共产党员。去年，她曾以日插秧三亩七分六厘的成绩，创自治区手插秧的最高纪录。今年，她参加县里插秧机手训练班学习，经过勤学苦练，掌握了插秧机的操作技术。春插开始，她一面带徒弟，教会了四、五十个妇女使用插秧机；一面不断钻研技术，提高自己的插秧工效。3月17日，她在十二个小时内，用广西五九—三型插秧机插秧十八亩四分七厘，规格全部为6×4，受到了参加验收的专区妇联主任和公社党委书记的赞扬。
