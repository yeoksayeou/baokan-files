Hebei's "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" High-Yield Movement is Immense in Scale
While Vigorously Grasping High-Yield Areas and High-Yield Plots, All Localities Spare No Effort in Grasping Low-Yield Areas and Eliminating Low-Yield Fields

The people of Hebei Province have made a great pledge to strive for the first great harvest of the 1960s. According to the principle put forward by the Provincial Party Committee of "Taking grain as the key link, combining grain and livestock, combining grain crops and cash crops, and promoting the all-round high-speed development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries," the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the province have comprehensively launched a large-scale high-yield movement of "1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton (ginned cotton), and 10,000 jin of potatoes" per mu over large areas.

The "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" large-area high-yield movement is a new development in the production upsurge of last winter and this spring. After the large-scale farmland capital construction of last winter and this spring, agricultural production conditions have undergone fundamental changes. By February 20, the province had newly built water conservancy projects to expand the irrigated area by more than 20 million mu, equivalent to four times the projects of the same period last year. The irrigated area in the province has reached more than 70% of the total cultivated land area, and 14 million mu have achieved irrigation mechanization. On the basis of water and river management, 46.4% of the province's cultivated land has been squared, and 35% has been converted into garden fields. Great achievements have also been made in the movement for deep plowing, soil improvement, and fertilizer accumulation and production. At the same time, after two years of continuous great leaps forward in agricultural and industrial production, better conditions have been provided for the continued high-speed development of agriculture this year. Last year, 23 counties in the province achieved a grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu, and 3 counties (cities) achieved more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. High-yield models of 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of ginned cotton, and 10,000 jin of potatoes per mu are found throughout the province. All this shows that agricultural production in Hebei Province has entered a new stage of comprehensive and sustained leap forward from low yield to high yield and higher yield. Therefore, when the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on this situation, proposed to launch a large-area high-yield movement of 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton, and 10,000 jin of potatoes throughout the province, it immediately received enthusiastic responses from party committees at all levels and the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the province. All localities have universally held oath-taking rallies for the leap forward, and have launched various forms of large-area high-yield competition movements for "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" high-yield plots, high-yield fields, high-yield teams, and high-yield ditches, in accordance with local conditions. Xinglong County, based on its regional characteristics, put forward high-yield targets of "10,000 jin of vegetables, 10,000 jin of potatoes, 100 jin of ginned cotton, 100 silkworms, and 3,000 jin of pears per mu." The cadres and masses of the entire county have launched a "each person accumulates 1,000 jin of fertilizer, irrigates half a mu of land" high-yield competition assault, determined to expand the irrigated area to 70% before spring sowing, and to apply 20,000 jin of fertilizer to all land. The "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" movement has greatly boosted the revolutionary spirit and production enthusiasm of the masses.

Vigorously grasping high-yield areas and high-yield plots, focusing on low-yield areas, and eliminating low-yield fields in an effort to achieve balanced high yields everywhere is an important aspect of the in-depth development of the "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" large-area high-yield movement. In order to achieve the requirements of "low yield leaping to high yield, high yield becoming higher yield," party committees at all levels have universally classified and ranked the production status of each production team, and have transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to focus on low-yield areas and backward areas while vigorously grasping high-yield areas and high-yield plots, organizing competitions to "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward." In this movement, various localities have adopted the following methods: First, the secretary takes command, cadres are assigned fixed points, responsibilities are divided, and the work is carried out to the end, strengthening the leadership of backward areas and low-yield areas. Zhuozhou County recently transferred more than 950 cadres, led by 9 county committee members, to take charge of all the low-yield teams in the county and launch a large-scale production assault in low-yield areas. Second, wherever the yield is low, plots are established there to transform low yield into high yield. The Zhangcheng Commune in Jingxing, Shijiazhuang City, is entirely terraced fields with very low yields. Now, by vigorously developing high-yield plots, the areas closer to the relatively flat roads are designated as high-yield roads, the contiguous sloping lands are designated as high-yield terraces, and the deep mountainous areas are divided into high-yield ditches, ridges, and depressions according to natural topography, vigorously carrying out farmland capital construction in accordance with local conditions, and quickly changing the production landscape. Third, in areas bordering counties and in remote areas, joint command headquarters are organized to carry out red banner competitions. Through this method, Baoding Prefecture has transformed 71% of its 700,000 mu of alkaline land, and 520,000 mu of its 920,000 mu of dry wheat have been transformed into paddy fields.

The "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" high-yield movement is closely integrated with intensive cultivation, promoting the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement. In the "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" movement in Shulu County, in order to accelerate the speed of various agricultural tasks, the experience of the Fangtian Red Banner Team of the Yaotou Production Team of the Fanjiacun Commune, which focused on reforming tools, improving work efficiency, and quality, was promoted throughout the county. More than 300 production teams in the county quickly reformed and created 53 types of tools for leveling land, transporting fertilizer, and drainage and irrigation, totaling more than 37,000 pieces. The Beimengzhuang Management Area of the Shuangmiao Commune in Jiaohe County originally lacked 200,000 laborers. After reforming the tools, not only was the labor shortage made up, but also 10,000 laborers were saved, strengthening intensive cultivation and farmland capital construction.

In the "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" movement, all localities have also paid attention to vigorously grasping high-yield crops, expanding the area of multiple cropping, and improving agricultural cultivation techniques. For example, Tianjin City decided to expand the planting area of three high-yield crops, rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, by 78% this year compared to last year, of which the area of high-yield fields should reach 30% to 50% of the planting area. In order to achieve this requirement, Tianjin held a city-wide agricultural science and technology leap forward conference and specialized meetings on rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, deciding to vigorously promote intercropping, relay cropping, and mixed cropping methods. Throughout the province, by mobilizing the masses to revise plans, the planting area of high-yield crops will be expanded by more than 11 million mu compared to last year, and the sown area will be increased by more than 5 million mu compared to last year.

At present, the people of the whole province are responding to the Provincial Party Committee's call for a "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" large-area high-yield, and are comprehensively launching a new production upsurge centered on preventing, resisting, and eliminating drought. The labor force of 3 million people, under the slogan of "Ensure sowing without rain in spring, ensure harvest without rain for a hundred days," is actively engaged in the struggle to prevent and resist drought, and is launching a major spring irrigation assault. So far, more than 28 million mu of land have been irrigated in the province, including 12 million mu of wheat returning green water and more than 16 million mu of bare land. And more than 2.1 million mu of wheat have been top-dressed with fertilizer.

    夺取大面积亩产“千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯”
    河北“千、百、万”丰产运动规模宏大
    各地在大抓高产区、丰产方的同时千方百计狠抓低产区、消灭低产田
    本报天津2日电　河北省人民立下雄心壮志，力夺六十年代第一个大丰收。全省广大干部群众，根据省委提出的“以粮为纲，粮畜并举，粮食作物与经济作物并举，农林牧副渔全面高速度发展”的方针，全面地展开了一个规模宏大的“千斤粮、百斤棉（皮棉）、万斤薯”的大面积丰产运动。
    “千、百、万”大面积丰产运动，是去冬今春生产高潮的新发展。经过去冬今春大规模的农田基本建设，农业生产条件已经发生了根本变化。到2月20日，全省新修水利工程扩大水地面积已达二千多万亩，相当于去年同期工程的四倍。全省水浇地达到全部耕地面积的70％以上，并且有一千四百万亩实现了灌溉机械化。在治水治河的基础上，占全省耕地面积的46．4％的土地，实现了方田化，35％的土地实现了园田化。深耕改良土壤和积肥造肥运动，也取得了巨大的成就。同时，经过两年农业和工业生产连续大跃进，为今年农业继续高速度发展提供了更好的条件。去年全省有二十三个县达到粮食亩产四百斤以上，三个县（市）皮棉达到百斤以上。亩产千斤粮、百斤皮棉、万斤薯的丰产典型遍及全省。这一切表明，河北省的农业生产已经进入一个由低产到高产，高产更高产地全面持续跃进的新阶段。因此，当中共河北省委根据这一形势提出在全省范围内开展一个千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯的大面积丰产运动的号召后，立即得到全省各级党委和广大干部群众的热烈响应。各地都普遍地召开了跃进誓师大会，因地制宜地掀起了多种形式的“千、百、万”丰产方、丰产田、丰产队、丰产沟的大面积丰产竞赛运动。兴隆县根据地区特点，提出了“万斤菜、万斤薯、百斤皮棉百张蚕，和亩产三千斤梨”的丰产指标。全县干部群众已经展开了一个“每人积千斤肥，灌半亩田”的丰产竞赛大突击，决心在春播前把水浇地扩大到70％，全部土地施肥达到两万斤。“千、百、万”运动，大大鼓舞了群众的革命干劲和生产积极性。
    大抓高产区、丰产方，狠抓低产区，消灭低产田，力争块块均衡高产，是“千、百、万”大面积丰产运动深入发展的一个重要方面。各级党委为了实现“低产跃高产，高产更高产”的要求，对各生产队的生产工作状况，普遍进行了分类排队，并抽调了大批干部下乡，在大抓高产区、丰产方的同时，猛攻低产区、后进区，组织“学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的竞赛。在这一运动中，各地采用了以下几种方法：一，书记挂帅，干部定点，分工包干，一抓到底，加强后进区、低产区的领导。涿县最近抽调了九百五十多名干部，由九个县委委员带领，把全县的低产队包下来，展开了低产区生产大突击。二，哪里低产，就在那里建方，变低产为高产。石家庄市井陉障城公社全部是梯田，产量很低。现在通过大搞丰产方，把靠近公路较平坦的地方划为丰产路，把连成片的坡地划为丰产坪，深山区按自然地形划为丰产沟、岭、洼，因地制宜大搞农田基本建设，很快地改变了生产面貌。三，在县与县交界的地区和边远地区，组织联合指挥部，开展连边红旗竞赛。保定专区通过这一办法，七十万亩碱地已改造好71％，全区九十二万亩旱麦，已有五十二万亩变成水田。
    “千、百、万”丰产运动和精耕细作密切地结合起来，促进了技术革新运动的深入开展。束鹿县在“千、百、万”运动中，为了加快各项农活的速度，在全县推广了范家庄公社摇头生产队以改革工具、提高工效和质量为中心的方田红旗队的经验，全县有三百多个生产队迅速地改制和创制了平地、送粪、排灌等工具五十三种，三万七千多件。交河县双庙公社北孟庄管理区原来缺少二十万个劳动力，经过改革工具，不仅补足了劳力的缺数，还节余了万名劳动力，加强了精耕细作和农田基本建设。
    在“千、百、万”运动中，各地还注意了大抓高产作物，扩大复种面积，改进农业耕作技术。如天津市决定今年水稻、玉米、甘薯三种高产作物的种植面积比去年扩大78％，其中丰产田的面积要达到种植面积的30％到50％。为了实现这一要求，天津召开了全市的农业科学技术跃进大会和水稻、玉米、甘薯专业会议，决定大力推行间作套种混种耕作方法。全省各地通过发动群众修订计划，高产作物种植面积将比去年扩大一千一百多万亩，播种面积将比去年增加五百多万亩。
    目前，全省人民响应省委“千、百、万”大面积丰产号召，正在全面地展开以防旱抗旱灭旱为中心的生产新高潮。三百万人的劳动大军在“春季无雨保播种，百日无雨保丰收”的口号下，积极地投入了防旱抗旱的斗争，展开春灌大突击。到目前为止，全省已浇地二千八百多万亩，其中灌小麦返青水一千二百万亩，灌溉白地一千六百多万亩。并有二千一百多亩小麦施了追肥。
