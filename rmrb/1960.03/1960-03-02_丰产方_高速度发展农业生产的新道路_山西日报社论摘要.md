    High-yield plots (ridges) represent socialist agricultural large-scale production and construction. They connect large areas of land, planting the same crop according to natural conditions and production plans, linking small plots to large plots, and encompassing large plots with small plots. Furthermore, they implement high-standard farmland capital construction and meticulous farming practices according to unified measures, better comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," with each word being a complete set, and comprehensively carrying out technological transformation. According to the actual situation in various regions, high-yield plots generally feature double-insured irrigated land, and high-yield ridges are level terraces. Correspondingly, they have established supporting pig farms, livestock farms, fertilizer plants, field toilets, and other fertilizer bases; and have carried out deep plowing to a depth of seven inches to one foot. From this, it can be seen that establishing large-scale contiguous high-yield plots (ridges) has opened up a new path for rapidly increasing farmland yields. This path is: focusing on high-yield agricultural plots to launch a large-scale, high-yield movement, and using this to drive increased production in general farmland, better implementing the principle of "diversified planting for more harvests and high yields for more harvests," greatly increasing yield per unit area and total output. At the same time, because high-yield plots involve connecting large areas of land, conducting high-standard farmland capital construction centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, and implementing high-standard, scientific, and meticulous farming with the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" as the guiding principle, this will not only cause major changes in the original high-yield fields, but also cause even greater changes in the original low-yield fields, with unit area yields leaping upward.
    Engaging in high-yield plots (ridges) brings many benefits and great advantages; it not only has tremendous practical significance but also profound historical significance. It is a directional issue for developing agricultural production at high speed in the new stage of socialist construction and greatly promoting the consolidation and development of the people's commune system. With the further development of the high-yield plot (ridge) movement, it will inevitably break through the small-scale collective management based on management districts and gradually develop towards large-scale collective management, thereby promoting a faster and continuous great leap forward in agricultural production, promoting the faster development of commune-run economies, and creating more favorable conditions for gradually realizing agricultural modernization and gradually transitioning to commune ownership. Party leaders at all levels in rural areas and departments of agriculture, industry, commerce, culture, and education, as well as all rural cadres, should adopt an attitude of wholehearted enthusiasm and actively feasible measures to strengthen leadership over the high-yield plot (ridge) construction movement, support this construction movement in all aspects; and they should be far-sighted, seeing both the present and the future; treating it as the fundamental key to winning a great leap forward in agricultural production this year, grasping it firmly, grasping it thoroughly; and also treating it as a long-term plan to fundamentally reform the farmland cultivation system, rationally arranging it, constantly improving it, and guiding this movement to develop healthily.
    From the current perspective, what issues should be paid special attention to when strengthening leadership over the high-yield plot (ridge) construction movement? According to the experience of various regions, first of all, a comprehensive plan should be made. Because the construction of high-yield plots (ridges) involves a series of issues: such as how to renovate and establish new canals, how to repair transportation, where to establish various factories (farms), where to plant trees and grass, where to raise fish and generate electricity, etc., all striving for rational layout, mutual promotion, convenient production, and labor saving. As for the extent and scope to which a commune or a management district should engage in high-yield plots (ridges), it should be determined according to the specific conditions of local labor, technology, and materials. The general requirement is the combination of commune, district, and team, the combination of large, medium, and small, from small to large, from low to high, seizing the right moment, and not delaying spring plowing. Which plots should be operated uniformly by the commune, which plots should be operated by the district, and which plots should be operated by the team? According to the experience of various regions, generally communes operate ten-thousand-mu plots, districts operate thousand-mu plots, and teams operate hundred-mu plots, and there are also forms of joint operations between communities and joint operations between districts. The orientation and all construction within the plots must also consider long-term construction and agricultural technology transformation issues. While vigorously engaging in high-yield plots (ridges), a comprehensive arrangement should also be made for the construction and planting of general farmland to ensure the completion of the sowing plan and prevent focusing on one thing and losing sight of another.
    Whether high-yield plots (ridges) can be done well ultimately depends on how well the capital construction work centered on water, fertilizer, and soil is done. High-yield plots must be guaranteed irrigated land, must have a reliable fertilizer base, must level the land, and, according to the management requirements of garden-style farming, change outdated terrain, orientation, and farmland facilities. As for non-productive construction, it can be done gradually, do not rush it, and do not spread too thin. In the construction of high-yield plots (ridges), the principle of "making do with what is available and building plots (ridges) diligently and thriftily" should be implemented. All past constructions that can still play a role now should be preserved.
    With the emergence of large-scale high-yield plots (ridges), the old management system and leadership methods must be changed accordingly. In view of the fact that most of the current high-yield plots (ridges) are jointly operated by several management districts or more than a dozen management districts within a commune, this requires the commune to strengthen unified leadership, organize professional teams, and strengthen large-scale collaboration between various management districts. To adapt to this new form of production organization and management, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work and organizational work within the plots (ridges). That is, cadres of communes and management districts should participate in production within the plots (ridges), establish command fields, guide large plots with small plots; and absorb active elements from the masses to participate in the leadership of high-yield plots (ridges). It is necessary to strengthen technical management within the plots (ridges), advocate the three-way combination of cadres, commune members, and technicians to ensure that high-yield plots (ridges) are well managed, so that each plot becomes a model field in the large-scale high-yield movement, and drives general fields to achieve an all-round bumper harvest.

    丰产方——高速度发展农业生产的新道路
    山西日报社论摘要
    丰产方（梁），是社会主义农业的大生产、大建设，它把大面积的土地联成一片，按照自然条件和生产计划，种植同一种作物，小方联大方，大方套小方；并且按照统一的措施，高标准地进行农田基本建设，高标准地实行精耕细作，更好地综合贯彻执行农业八字宪法，字字成套，全面地进行技术改造。从各地实际进行的情况来看，丰产方一般是双保险水地，丰产梁是水平梯田；并且建立了相适应的养猪场、牧畜场、肥料厂、田间厕所等肥料基地；深翻七寸到一尺左右。由此看出：大面积的连片建立丰产方（梁），就为高速度地提高农田产量开辟了一条新的道路，这条道路就是：以农田丰产方为中心，开展大面积高额丰产运动，并以此带动一般农田的增产，更好地贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收两条腿走路的方针，大大提高单位面积产量和总产量。同时，由于丰产方是大面积的土地联成一片，以水肥土为中心进行高标准的农田基本建设，以农业八字宪法为纲实行高标准的科学的精耕细作，这就不仅要使原来的高产田发生大变化，同时要使原来的低产田发生更大的变化，单位面积产量将要飞跃提高。
    大搞丰产方（梁）好处多得很，优越性大得很；不仅有巨大的现实意义，并且有深远的历史意义，是社会主义建设进入新阶段高速度发展农业生产，大大促进人民公社制度巩固和发展的一个方向性的问题。随着丰产方（梁）运动的进一步发展，必将突破以管理区为单位的小规模的集体经营，逐步向着大规模的集体经营发展，从而促进农业生产的更高速度的连续大跃进，促进社办经济的更快发展，为逐步实现农业现代化和逐步向公社所有制过渡，创造更为有利的条件。农村各级党的领导和农业、工业、商业、文教等部门，以及所有农村干部，都应该采取满腔热情的态度，和积极可行的措施，加强对丰产方（梁）建设运动的领导，从各方面支援这个建设运动；并且要高瞻远瞩，目光四射，既看到现在，也看到将来；既要当作是今年夺取农业生产大跃进的根本关键去大抓、狠抓，抓到底；又要当作是从根本上改革农田耕作制度的长远大计，合理布局，不断改进，引导这个运动健康地向前发展。
    从当前来看，加强对于丰产方（梁）建设运动的领导，有哪些问题应该特别注意呢？根据各地的经验，首先要作好全面规划。因为丰产方（梁）的建设，牵涉到一系列的问题：如渠道如何破旧立新，交通如何整修，各厂（场）何处建立，何处种树种草，何处养鱼发电，等等，都力求布局合理，互为促进，便利生产，节约劳力。至于一个社、一个管理区的丰产方（梁）搞到什么程度？范围多大？要根据当地的劳力、技术、物资等具体情况而定。总的要求是社、区、队结合，大中小结合，由小到大、由低到高，抓住火候，不误春耕。哪些方由社统一经营，哪些方由区经营，哪些方由队经营？各地的经验，一般是社营万亩方、区营千亩方、队营百亩方，也还有采取社区合营、区区联营的形式。方位以及方内的一切建筑，还必须考虑到长远的建设和农业技术改造的问题。在大搞丰产方（梁）的同时，对一般农田的建设、种植等，也要做通盘安排，保证完成播种计划，防止顾此失彼。
    丰产方（梁）能不能搞得好，归根到底要看以水、肥、土为中心的基本建设工作做得如何。丰产方必须是保证水地，必须有可靠的肥料基地，必须平整土地，并根据园田化的管理要求，将过时的地形、方位和农田设施，加以改变。至于非生产性的建设可以逐步去搞，不要操之过急，不要铺大摊子。在丰产方（梁）的建设中，要贯彻因陋就简、勤俭办方（梁）的原则，凡是过去已有的建设，只要是当下还能发挥作用的，就要把它保存下来。
    大面积丰产方（梁）的出现，旧的管理制度与领导方法，必须作相应的改变。鉴于目前大多数丰产方（梁）是一个公社内的几个管理区或是十几个管理区联合经营的，这就要求公社加强统一领导，组织专业队，加强各管理区之间的大协作。为适应这种新的生产组织和管理形式，要加强方（梁）内的政治思想工作、组织工作。这就是，公社、管理区的干部，要参与方（梁）内的生产，建立指挥田，以小方指导大方；并要吸收群众中的积极分子，参加丰产方（梁）的领导。要加强方（梁）内的技术管理，提倡干部、社员、技术人员三结合，保证把丰产方（梁）经营好，使方方成为大面积高额丰产方运动中的标兵田，把一般田也带动起来，取得全面丰收。
