    Deep Condolences, Angry Protests
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    On March 4th, the ship "La Coubre," carrying weapons for the Cuban revolutionary government, suddenly exploded in Havana harbor. In this explosion, according to incomplete statistics so far, 333 people were injured and 72 died. This is a shocking tragedy perpetrated by foreign criminals and counter-revolutionaries. This is a challenge to the dignity of the Cuban people and all mankind! The people of our country express deep condolences to the victims of this incident, profound sympathy to the injured, and angry protest against the planners of this barbaric crime!
    Who are the murderers? Why did they commit such an inhuman atrocity? The Cuban people, the Latin American people, and the people of the world all see this very clearly. The Cuban government has already arrested an American linked to the explosion. Cuban Prime Minister Castro pointed out that the explosion of the "La Coubre" was the result of sabotage premeditated at the port of origin, and the investigation has confirmed this. He said that the culprits who carried out the sabotage should be sought among officials of the U.S. government. The U.S. government had exerted pressure to prevent Cuba from purchasing weapons needed to defend its sovereignty. The U.S. military attaché and consuls put pressure on the Belgian government to prevent it from selling weapons to Cuba, and when this plot failed, it prepared this criminal sabotage. This is another intervention by the United States to prevent Cuba from obtaining weapons. Everyone knows that the United States hates the Cuban revolution to the core and will stop at nothing to strangle it. It constantly sends planes to bomb Cuban cities and villages, burning Cuban sugarcane fields; it threatens Cuba by reducing sugar import quotas, wanting to suffocate Cuba's economic life; it even openly declared in a note to Cuba on February 29th that the United States has the right to take "any steps" in Cuba! Therefore, as "Revolución" pointed out, those who carry out economic aggression against Cuba, direct the burning of Cuban sugarcane fields from the air, and use war criminals to serve their barbaric purposes cannot be unconnected with the murder of March 4th.
    It is disgusting that the day after the explosion, the U.S. Embassy in Havana shamelessly "expressed on orders" the United States' "deep sadness" for this "tragedy" and even asked to "share the grief and shock that this disaster has brought to the Cuban people"... Enough, the United States is creating and increasing Cuba's disasters every day, while wanting to "share" Cuba's "grief," what a hypocritical and ugly face! Not only that, but this "expression" by the United States deliberately avoided "government-to-government condolences." According to the Associated Press, "the handling of this statement again reflects the strained relations between the United States and Castro's regime in Cuba," and "omitting the government in this telegram shows that it does not like the government itself." It can be seen that even in this extremely hypocritical "condolence," there is a malicious intention of the United States towards the Cuban revolutionary government and people. U.S. imperialism is trying every possible way to strangle the Cuban revolution, and any barbaric and despicable means will be used. It is therefore absolutely necessary for the Cuban people to maintain a high degree of vigilance against enemies at home and abroad at all times.
    Now, the Cuban people, in the face of the barbaric atrocities and mad threats of U.S. imperialism, are more united and acting more heroically. Six million Cubans share a common hatred and are ready to fight, determined to defend their revolution. Countless moving scenes are appearing in revolutionary Havana and revolutionary Cuba. Tens of thousands of Havana citizens are lining up at all medical stations, ready to donate blood for the injured. A large number of workers and staff responded to the call of the Rebel Army Television, swearing to donate twice as much money to the country as they had previously donated in order to buy weapons again to defend the revolution. Workers all over Cuba held a nationwide strike, and all Cuban militias held demonstrations to protest against the provocateurs. On March 5th, 500,000 people in Havana participated in the funeral of the victims of the explosion and a demonstration protesting against U.S. crimes. This revolutionary spirit can fully illustrate that the Cuban people are invincible. The famous Cuban labor leader Lázaro Peña said well: The pain of the Cuban people is expressed as a common anger against events with all the characteristics of criminal sabotage. Imperialists believe that the Cuban people cannot win through revolution, but we answer them: "We can win!"

    沉痛的哀悼  愤怒的抗议
    本报评论员
    3月4日，给古巴革命政府运载武器的轮船“勒库布尔号”，在哈瓦那港突然发生爆炸。在这次爆炸中，据到目前为止的不完全统计，有三百三十三人受伤，七十二人死亡。这是外国罪犯和反革命分子所制造的骇人听闻的大惨案。这是对古巴人民和全人类尊严的挑战！我国人民对这次事件的死难者表示沉痛哀悼，对受伤者表示深切慰问，对这个野蛮罪行的策划者表示愤怒的抗议！
    谁是谋杀者？他们为什么要制造如此灭绝人性的暴行？这是古巴人民、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民都看得很清楚的。古巴政府已经逮捕了一名与这次爆炸事件有关的美国人。古巴总理卡斯特罗指出，“勒库布尔号”的爆炸事件是在起载港口蓄谋准备的破坏造成的，所作的调查证实了这一点。他说，应该从美国政府的官员中寻找进行破坏的祸首。美国政府曾经施加压力阻止古巴购买保卫主权所需要的武器。美国武官和领事向比利时政府施加压力不让它向古巴出售武器，当这个图谋失败之后它就准备了这次罪恶的破坏。这是美国为防止古巴得到武器而再次进行的干涉。谁都知道，美国对古巴革命恨之入骨，为了扼杀古巴革命，无所不用其极。它不断派飞机轰炸古巴的城市和乡村，烧毁古巴的甘蔗田；它用降低食糖进口限额来威胁古巴，想要窒息古巴的经济生活；它甚至在2月29日给古巴的照会中公开宣布美国有权在古巴采取“任何步骤”！因此，正如“革命报”所指出的，那些对古巴实行经济侵略，指挥从空中焚烧古巴甘蔗田，并使战犯为他们的野蛮目的效劳的人，不可能与3月4日的谋杀没有关连。
    令人作呕的是，爆炸事件发生的第二天，美国驻哈瓦那大使馆居然恬不知耻地“奉命表示”美国对这个“悲剧”“深为难过”，并且还要求“分担这次灾难给古巴人民带来的悲哀和震惊”……算了吧，美国天天在制造和增加古巴的灾祸，一边却要“分担”古巴的“悲哀”，真是好一副假慈悲的丑相！不但这样，美国这个“表示”，还故意避开了“政府对政府的慰问”，据美联社报道，“这个声明的处理再次反映了美国同古巴的卡斯特罗政权之间的紧张关系”，“在这种电报里略而不提政府是表明对政府本身并不喜欢”。可见，即使在这个极端虚伪的“慰问”中，也包藏着美国对古巴革命政府和人民的祸心。美帝国主义千方百计地想要扼杀古巴革命，任何野蛮和卑鄙的手段都会使得出来，可见古巴人民时时刻刻对国内外敌人保持着高度警惕，是完全必要的。
    现在，古巴人民，在美帝国主义的野蛮的暴行和疯狂的威胁面前，更坚强地团结起来，更英勇地行动起来了。六百万古巴人民同仇敌忾，枕戈待旦，决心保卫自己的革命。无数动人的景象出现在革命的哈瓦那和革命的古巴。成千上万的哈瓦那市民在所有的医疗站排着长长的队伍，准备为受伤的人输血。大批工人和职员响应起义军电视台的号召，宣誓向国家捐出相当以前捐款的两倍的钱，以便再次购买武器保卫革命。古巴各地工人举行了全国性罢工，古巴所有的民兵都举行了示威，向挑衅者抗议。3月5日，哈瓦那有五十万人参加了爆炸事件的死难者的葬礼和抗议美国罪行的示威游行。这种革命的气概可以充分说明古巴人民是不可战胜的。古巴著名工人领袖拉萨罗·培尼亚说得好：古巴人的悲痛表现为对具有罪恶破坏的一切特征的事件的共同愤怒。帝国主义认为古巴人民不可能靠革命取得胜利，但是我们回答他们：“我们能够胜利！”
