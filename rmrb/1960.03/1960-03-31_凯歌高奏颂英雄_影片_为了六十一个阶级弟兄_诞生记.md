    Triumphant Song Praising Heroes
    ——The Making of the Film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers"
    Xin Wen
    These are the final scenes of the documentary art film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers": The Fengnan Highway, built by the sixty-one class brothers themselves, is open to traffic. Large trucks loaded with supplies head towards Sanmenxia. The recovered workers, radiant with health, stand on the trucks and wave to the cheering crowds. In the distance, the Sanmenxia construction site is a sea of flags, flood control dams stand in the rushing torrents, cranes swing their giant arms, and a magnificent communist paean soars into the clouds.
    During these eighty minutes of screening time, the audience is deeply inspired by the spirit of the times revealed by the film – the communist style. Every heroic image in the film, full of class affection, every phrase sparkling with the light of communist thought, every piece of music overflowing with the spirit of revolutionary optimism, takes the audience into a realm of sublimity. When the plane carrying the "miracle drug" takes off from the Capital Airport, flying through the night sky to Pinglu; when a small boat braves the turbulent currents, and the screen shows a close-up of the old boatman's tense but determined face; when the doctor says kindly to the critically ill worker, "Comrade, hold on a little longer, the plane from the capital with the 'miracle drug' will arrive soon"; when the old man says to his rescued son, "Chairman Mao is your real father and mother"... With the changing scenes, how many viewers wipe away tears of gratitude again and again at the same time as the characters on the screen, shouting from the bottom of their hearts, "Long live the Communist Party, long live Chairman Mao!" Even the factory director, directors, and photographers who have been engaged in film work for decades – these "behind-the-scenes people" who have watched the rushes so many times that they can even recite every line – still cannot suppress their excitement when they finally watch the finished film.
    This film is the crystallization of collective wisdom, a product of communist collaboration, and another example of how artistic creation can be carried out quickly, well, and economically. The entire film, from scriptwriting to completion of filming, took only sixteen working days. Its creation process is also a communist triumphal song!
    Who is conducting this triumphal song? Who is the director of this film? Its commander-in-chief is the Party's General Line, Mao Zedong Thought, and the lofty communist style of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers"; its director is millions of people full of communist spirit.
    Script Written in 22 Hours
    Late at night, Xie Tian, director of the Beijing Film Studio, and Chen Fangqian, assistant director, are rushing to write the script. The more they write, the more excited they become. When they are most excited, they dance and gesture, even improvising "music".
    The night before, the Party committee approved their request to write the script and mobilized all the actors and staff of the studio to write it with them. They were determined to respond to the Party committee's call, fight against time with the communist style of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," and shorten the completion time from three days to one day. The other directors and actors also held an emergency meeting that night. At eight o'clock the next morning, a studio-wide mass movement to rush the script began. While the directing and acting scriptwriting core group collectively discussed the script outline, all the studio staff were also enthusiastically discussing the news reports about the Pinglu incident. Everyone used their brains and put forward nearly a hundred suggestions. Letters of determination from the staff flew to the desks of the scriptwriting core group like snowflakes:
    "The film must be understandable to the peasants."
    "Shoot simultaneously in Beijing and Pinglu, working on two fronts to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results!"
    Thinking of this, they worked even harder. At one o'clock in the morning, the climax of the whole play - "The Airdrop of Medicine Chests at Shengren Ravine" began.
    "Four piles of firewood are lit;
    Everyone holds their breath and listens for the sound of the plane. Suddenly someone shouts: 'Here it comes!'
    Thousands of hands are raised high;
    People flock to the parachute like a tide;
    Amidst cheers, the medicine chest is passed along in a long, dragon-like line of people..."
    As they wrote, they became "characters in the play" again. They left their desks, ran around, and almost simultaneously sang the melody of "The East is Red, the Sun Rises," and a moving "split-screen" was produced.
    Day broke, a thick pile of manuscripts accumulated, and cigarette butts piled up into small mounds. Assistant directors Zhao Yuan and Dong Kena, who were assigned to write other sections, came to "join forces" with their original drafts one after another. After they read it aloud from beginning to end, the clock pointed to six o'clock. The task of completing the first draft in twenty-four hours was completed in twenty-two hours.
    Red Hearts Linked Together
    As soon as the news that the Beijing Film Studio had decided to shoot "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" was published in the newspaper, countless helping hands immediately stretched out from all directions. As soon as the script was written, the heads of many art units in Beijing discussed the collaborative plan for shooting the film. They said to the heads of the Beijing Film Studio: "You can choose the actors, whoever you want, we will give them to you, they will be at your beck and call."
    Achieving this was not a simple matter. These days, several theaters were also rushing to rehearse "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," and some were rushing to rehearse congratulatory programs for the National People's Congress and the "May Day" holiday. However, each theater, with the communist style of the Pinglu incident, helped the Beijing Film Studio arrange an unprecedentedly strong cast. Some directors and actors who participated in this collaboration said: "It is a great honor to be able to show even just a back view in this film promoting communist style." It was this style that brought people together from their busy schedules, and a "symphony of great collaboration" began:
    The famous actress Shu Xiuwen, who was recuperating, heard that a middle-aged actress was needed to play the Minister of Health, so she went to her attending doctor and said, "Let me be discharged from the hospital a few days early to play the role. This is a political task!" Because her illness had basically recovered, the attending doctor granted her request.
    The shooting of the scene at the Beijing Special Pharmaceutical Business Department involved six or seven art units, and the shooting time coincided with the performance time of each unit. What should be done? The director of the China Children's Theater said: Zhao Qiansun, the main actor in the drama "A Revolutionary Family," can participate in the shooting. His role will be filled by someone else. Bai Fengxi from the China Youth Art Theater ran into the temporary studio - the Special Pharmaceutical Business Department - without even removing her makeup after stepping off the stage. It turned out that she was playing the same role - Little Li - on stage and in the film.
    The "August 1st" Film Studio sent out the main actors and special effects staff to assist in the shooting. The teachers of the Central Academy of Fine Arts had just agreed on the poster design with the Beijing Film Studio, and the representatives of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House brought the poster drafts to solicit opinions.
    The scope of the great collaboration quickly expanded from Beijing to Tianjin, Shanxi, and Sanmenxia, and from the literary and artistic circles to more than a dozen different departments, including industry, commerce, transportation, construction sites, people's communes, troops, government agencies, and schools. When the Beijing Railway Bureau heard that the film crew was going to Pinglu, it immediately added a special car to the already full train. Letters from the masses were sent to the Beijing Film Studio. Some sent in their own scripts and newspapers with news reports about the Pinglu incident, and in the letters they instructed: "The places marked with red lines are the shots that I think are most meaningful and must be filmed well!" The air force unit that was responsible for airdropping the "miracle drug" selected the captain, mechanics, and other personnel to form a cooperation group to listen to the "commands" of the Beijing Film Studio. A close-up of an aircraft instrument in the film was operated behind the scenes by the "nameless hero," instrument operator Xia Kechun.
    The Battle of Politics Leading Art
    On the bustling Bamiancao Street in the capital, a young man was riding a motorcycle, sweating profusely, and speeding along. He suddenly stopped in front of the Special Pharmaceutical Business Department. The person riding the motorcycle was Yu Yang, who played Lao Wang, the car driver who picked up medicine for the sixty-one class brothers. In order to play this scene well, he tested the car at high speed at this busy intersection four or five times. It was exactly the time when people were getting off work in the evening, and at least sixty or more cars, bicycles, and more than a hundred pedestrians passed through here every minute. But Yu Yang was thinking: "When I picked up the medicine, I was so anxious, how could the car not be fast?" Fortunately, there were so many police officers assisting in maintaining order, and so many viewers were supporting them. Yu Yang boldly and conscientiously practiced, and each time he pushed the car, weighing several hundred pounds, onto the sidewalk, half a foot high, panting for breath. It was not until the director shouted "Stop" that he realized that his two close-fitting clothes were all soaked with sweat.
    Yu Yang's lines were only eight words long, the shortest in the whole film. But everyone said he acted well. Yu Yang said with a smile: "From the day we read the news reports about the Pinglu incident, we thought: If we encountered such a thing again, we would do the same. I have rarely sweated so much in my films!"
    All the actors were like this.
    In Pinglu, they were filming a scene where Hao, the secretary of the county Party committee, visited the workers in the hospital after they recovered. Zhang Ping, who played Secretary Hao, had to speak for more than two minutes, which was the longest and most difficult scene in the whole film. On the day of filming, new lines were added temporarily. Time was tight, and everyone was worried about Zhang Ping. The camera started rolling. Zhang Ping thought of the Party giving the sixty-one class brothers a second life, and of Secretary Hao's kind instructions when he studied the lines with him before filming, and a burst of heat welled up in his heart. He felt that his mind was more flexible and his mouth seemed easier to use. The more he spoke, the smoother it became, and the higher his tone became. The image of a county Party committee secretary full of revolutionary optimism reappeared in front of the camera. When the director shouted "Okay, stop," the surrounding viewers cheered in unison. Gao Hongtao, a photographer with many years of experience, was so excited that he forgot to turn off the camera switch.
    The acting was fast and good. The actors said: This is really a battle of politics leading art.
    The Style of the People of Pinglu
    Pinglu, unforgettable ten days of filming life! Sincere class friendship closely linked the people of Pinglu and Beijing together.
    The film crew could not hear a single word of "difficulty" in Pinglu. From six-year-old children to seventy-year-old men, from eggs to tractors, 5,000 extras, and more than 300 large and small props, as long as the film crew needed them, people were at their beck and call, and things were readily available. When the Puju Opera Troupe heard that they needed their assistance in filming, 30 to 40 actors immediately lined up in a long snake formation, "feel free to choose." An old man heard that his cotton-padded jacket was suitable for the old boatman's costume in the film, and immediately sent it over, leaving without even leaving his name.
    The people of Pinglu regarded filming this film as their obligation and promoting communist style as their responsibility. It was this feeling that moved more than 3,000 workers to cross mountains and ridges, bring their own props and dry food, and come to Shengren Ravine to assist in the filming of the "airdrop" scene; it was also this feeling that encouraged Li Zhongkui, the 69-year-old production team leader, to travel 30 miles of mountain road for three consecutive nights to reach the film crew. This old man with a silver beard hanging on his chest appeared in a close-up shot of the "airdrop" scene. He smiled and looked up at the plane sent by the capital, revealing infinite gratitude. After he finished filming this shot, he said: "How many days has it been since the plane delivered the medicine? I wanted to express my feelings to the Party and Chairman Mao, and now I have finally fulfilled my wish."
    The county Party committee actively led this filming battle. In the piercingly cold late at night, on the turbulent banks of the Yellow River, and in front of the steep walls of the Fengnan Highway, whenever the film crew was shooting important scenes, the secretaries of the county Party committee could be seen standing with the director, brainstorming ideas. Once, the county Party committee's expanded meeting had just ended, and the meeting place immediately became a "temporary studio," and all the members of the county Party committee became "actors." When the audience saw the realistic performances of those county Party committee members in this scene, did they ever think that this was their first time on the screen?
    Night Battle on the Yellow River
    "Swear to sing the red flag with a red heart" became the common belief of the film crew. When filming the scene of the old boatman crossing the Yellow River at night, the director and actors used the heroic spirit of the old boatman to express this heroic character.
    At the Maojin Ferry, cliffs stood on both sides of the bank, and the river rushed straight down. From a distance, the roar of the waves could be heard. Although no stormy waves could be seen on the surface of the water, the water was deep and the current was rapid. A whirlpool could knock a person into the bottom of the river! The Pinglu film crew of the Beijing Film Studio launched an intense battle on this rushing water.
    On a small boat like a park yacht, two actors were on the bow, the lighting worker holding a strong light in the middle, and the photographer holding the machine standing at the stern. The small boat was hit and rocked by the waves. Because the load was too heavy, the stern sank and water poured into the cabin. At the moment when people jumped to the nearby prepared large boat, the photographer captured the tense expressions of the "old boatman" and the "pharmacist."
    The Pinglu part of the film was finished, and the film crew returned to Beijing. Passing through the Maojin Ferry, the twilight was dim, and the moonlight illuminated the Yellow River like a tumbling and roaring golden python. The director and photographer felt that this scene was more real and moving than the night scene filmed the day before, so they immediately decided to seize one hour before getting on the train to shoot a night scene. Director Chen Fangqian carried a horse lamp and ran and swayed on the beach on the opposite bank. It was dark, he couldn't see the road, he walked with one foot deep and one foot shallow, slipped into the water, climbed up, and ran again. The photographer looked from the bank in the distance, the horse lamp flickering on and off, much like the sparks flickering in the distance. This scene, symbolizing the flickering of the horse lamp on the small boat, became a very exciting shot in the film.
    In the "Recording Studio" and "Printing Factory"
    The "battlefield" shifted to the recording studio, editing room, and Beijing Film Printing Factory.
    In the recording studio and editing room, people broke the conventional practice of first editing the entire film and then recording the sound, and started a "flowing operation" of editing a section and recording a section. Musicians Li Huanzhi, Qu Xixian, and Wang Zhenya became busy people here. According to Qu Xixian's suggestion, several main narrations in the film adopted a singing form. As soon as the theme song reflecting the pulse of the times - "Communist Triumphal Song" - was recorded, it was immediately sung by its first listeners. After listening to the recording, Li Huanzhi said with satisfaction: "Although the music was composed by three people, divided into sections, and they had not seen the rushes beforehand, the common political enthusiasm made the theme of promoting the communist style as a red line run through the whole song, and the effect and rhythm were very harmonious with the plot."
    The 500 employees of the Beijing Film Printing Factory had already fulfilled their promise to the Beijing Film Studio when they printed the first batch of rushes more than ten days ago: "We guarantee that you will have no worries." The employees printed the first batch of rushes in two hours and twenty minutes, far behind the old record of printing the rushes in twenty-four hours. Before the film had even started shooting, they had already set up a general headquarters for printing the film while ensuring the progress of their daily work. Each time the rushes were printed, all eight processes in the factory launched an intense "relay race," not only continuously ensuring high speed and high quality, but also comprehensively promoting the leap forward in all aspects of work through the printing of this film.
    On the 30th, 58 cinemas and clubs in Beijing screened the film. The more than 890 copies rushed by the Beijing Film Printing Factory will be distributed nationwide before April 5th.
    The birth of the film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" once again tells people: Under the leadership of the Party, treating the reality of the Great Leap Forward with full enthusiasm, more resolutely implementing the mass line, and better implementing communist collaboration, we can reflect our great and heroic era quickly and well!

    凯歌高奏颂英雄
    ——影片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”诞生记
    辛文
    这是纪录性艺术片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”最后几个场景：六十
  一个阶级弟兄亲手筑成的风南公路通车了，一辆辆满载物资的大卡车驶往三门峡。康复后的民工容光焕发，站在卡车上向欢腾的人群招手。远方，三门峡工地旗帜飘扬，一座座拦洪坝矗立在激流中，起重机摇着巨臂，气势磅礴的共产主义凯歌高唱入云。
    在这八十分钟的放映时间里，观众深深为影片所揭示的时代精神——共产主义风格鼓舞着。影片中每一个充满着阶级深情的英雄形象，每一句闪烁着共产主义思想光辉的语言，每一段洋溢着革命乐观主义精神的音乐，都把观众带进了崇高的境界。当载着“神药”的飞机从首都机场升起，穿过夜空飞向平陆时；当一叶扁舟冲过奔腾的激流，银幕上显现出老艄公紧张而又坚定的面部特写时；当医生亲切地对生命垂危的民工说：“同志，再坚持一会儿，首都送‘神药’的飞机马上就要到了”时；当老汉对中毒获救的儿子说：“毛主席才是你的亲爹娘”时……，随着画面的转换，有多少观众一次又一次地在和银幕上的人物同时擦拭着感激的热泪，从心底里呼喊着“共产党万岁，毛主席万岁”呵！就连从事电影工作几十年的厂长、导演、摄影师——这些连续看过多少次样片，甚至能够背得出每句台词的“幕后人”，在最后看完这部影片时，也仍然抑止不住自己的激动。
    这部影片是集体智慧的结晶，共产主义大协作的产儿，艺术创作能够多快好省进行的又一例证。全片从编剧到拍摄完成只用了十六个工作日，它的创制过程也是一曲共产主义凯歌！
    谁在指挥这曲凯歌？谁是这部影片的导演？它的总指挥是党的总路线，是毛泽东思想，是“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”那种崇高的共产主义风格；它的导演是千万个充满共产主义风格的人们。
    22小时编出剧本
    深夜，北京电影制片厂导演谢添、副导演陈方千正在赶编剧本。他们越写越兴奋，最激动时就手舞足蹈地表演起来，还顺口配着“音乐”。
    头天晚上，党委批准了他俩编剧的请求，并且发动全厂演员、职工同他们一起编这个剧本。他们决心响应党委号召，用“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”那种共产主义风格，同时间搏斗，把完稿时间由三天缩短到一天。其他的导演、演员们这天晚上也举行了紧急会议。第二天早晨八点，一个全厂性的赶编剧本的群众运动开始了。在导演、演员的编剧核心组集体讨论剧本提纲时，全厂职工也在热烈讨论平陆事件的通讯，人人开动脑筋，提出了近百条建议。职工们的决心书雪片似地飞向编剧核心组的案头：
    “影片要让农民看得懂。”
    “北京、平陆同时拍摄，双管齐下，多快好省！”
    一想到这些，他俩的劲儿更足了。凌晨一点，全剧的高潮——“圣人涧空投药箱”动笔了。
    “四堆柴火点燃起来了；
    大家屏息着听飞机声，忽然有人喊：“来啦！”
    几千双手高高举起；
    人们潮水般涌向降落伞；
    一片欢呼声中，药箱在像一条长龙般的人群中传动……
    写着写着，他俩又变成了“剧中人”。他们离开案头，跑着跑着，几乎同时唱出了“东方红，太阳升”的旋律，一个动人的“分镜头”产生了。
    天亮了，稿子积了厚厚一迭，香烟头堆成了小堆。分工写另几段戏的副导演赵元、董克娜先后带着原稿来“会师”。他们从头到尾朗诵了一遍以后，时针指向六时，原定二十四小时完成初稿的任务，二十二小时完成了。
    颗颗红心连在一起
    报纸上一刊出北影决定拍摄“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的消息，数不清的支援之手立刻从四面八方伸过来。剧本刚刚写好，北京许多艺术单位的负责人就在一起讨论了拍摄这部影片的大协作方案。他们对北影的负责人说：“演员由你们挑，要谁给谁，随叫随到。”
    要做到这一点，并不是简单的事。这几天，好几个剧院也在赶排“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”，有的在为人民代表大会和“五一”节赶排献礼剧目，但是各个剧院以平陆事件的共产主义风格，协助北影为这部影片安排出一个阵容空前强大的演员表。参加这次协作的一些导演、演员们说：“能在这部宣扬共产主义风格的影片中照上一个背影也是很大的光荣。”正是这种风格使人们从百忙中汇聚在一起，一曲“大协作交响乐”开始了：
    疗养中的著名演员舒绣文听说需要一个中年女演员扮演卫生部长，就去找主治大夫说：“让我提前几天出院，去演一次吧，这是个政治任务！”主治大夫因为她的病已基本痊愈，准许了她的请求。
    拍摄北京特种药品经营部的戏，牵涉六七个艺术单位，拍摄时间同各单位演戏的时间又正好矛盾，怎么办？中国儿童剧院的导演说：话剧“革命的一家”的主要演员赵钱孙可以参加拍摄工作，他的角色由别人替补。中国青年艺术剧院的白峰溪下了舞台连装也不卸就跑进了临时摄影棚——特种药品经营部，原来她在舞台上和影片中饰演的是同一个角色——小李。
    “八一”电影制片厂抽出主要演员和特技工作人员来协助拍摄，中央美术学院教师们刚同北影商定好海报的图案，人民美术出版社的代表又带着海报画稿前来征求意见了。
    大协作的范围迅速从北京扩及到天津、山西、三门峡，从文艺界扩大到工业、商业、交通运输、工地、人民公社、部队、政府机关、学校等十多个不同的部门。北京铁路局听说摄制组要赶赴平陆，立即在已经满员的列车后边加挂了一辆专车。一封封群众来信寄向北影。有的寄来了自己编写的剧本和刊有平陆事件通讯的报纸，并且在信中嘱咐道：“划红道道的地方是我认为最有意义的镜头，一定要拍好！”曾经担负空投“神药”任务的空军某部抽调机长、机械师等组成协作组听候北影“调遣”，影片中有一个飞机仪表的特写镜头，就是“无名英雄”、仪表员夏克春在幕后操纵的。政治带动艺术的战斗
    在车水马龙的首都八面槽大街，一个小伙子满头大汗骑着摩托车飞驶而来，突然停在特种药品经营部门前。骑在车上的是于洋，他扮演为六十一个阶级弟兄取药的汽车司机老王。他为了演好这场戏，在这个热闹的十字路口高速试车四、五次了。这正是傍晚下班的时候，这里每分钟至少要通过六十多辆大小汽车、自行车和一百多个行人。可是于洋在想：“取药时我的心那么急，车怎么能不快？”好在有这么多的民警协助维持秩序，有这么多的观众都在支持他们。于洋又大胆地认真地练下去，而且每次都把几百斤重的车子推上人行道旁半尺高的路崖，累的上气不接下气。直到导演喊“停”，他才发现贴身两件衣服全被汗湿透了。
    于洋的台词只有八个字，是全片中最短的。可是大家都说他演的好。于洋笑着对大家说：“我们从阅读平陆事件通讯那一天起就想：假如再遇到这样的事，我们也会这样做。我拍电影以来还很少出这么多真汗呢！”
    所有的演员也是这样。
    平陆，正拍县委郝书记在民工病愈后到医院慰问的一场戏。饰演郝书记的张平的台词要说二分多钟，是全片中最长、最难演的。拍戏那天，又临时加了新词。时间紧迫，大家都为张平捏了一把汗。摄影机开动了。张平想到党给六十一个阶级弟兄以第二次生命，想到拍戏以前郝书记同他研究台词时的亲切嘱咐，一股热力油然而生。他感到脑筋更灵巧，嘴巴也似乎更好使了。他越说越顺畅，音调越来越高昂，一个充满革命乐观主义精神的党委书记的形象再现在摄影机前。当导演喊“好，停”时，四周参观的人们齐声喝采。有多年经验的摄影师高洪涛，竟兴奋得连摄影机的开关也忘关了。
    戏演得又快又好。演员们说：这真是一场政治带动艺术的战斗。
    平陆人的风格
    平陆，难忘的十多天的拍摄生活！真挚的阶级友爱把平陆人和北京人紧紧地联结在一起。
    摄制组在平陆听不到一个“难”字。从六岁孩童到七十老翁，从鸡蛋到拖拉机，五千人的群众演员，三百多件大小道具，只要摄制组需要，人，随叫随到，物，应有尽有。当蒲剧团听说需要他们协助拍戏时，三四十名演员立即排成一字长蛇阵，“任凭挑选”。一位老汉听说他的棉袄适合给影片中老艄公做服装，立刻送来，连名字也不留就走了。
    平陆人民把拍这部电影看成是自己的义务，把宣扬共产主义风格当做自己的责任。正是这种心情，使三千多民工翻山越岭，自带道具、干粮，来到圣人涧协助拍摄“空投”场面；也正是这种心情，鼓舞着六十九岁的老生产队长李中奎接连三个夜晚，跋涉三十里山路，赶到摄制组来。这位胸前垂着银须的老汉出现在“空投”一场的一个特写镜头中，他微笑地仰视着首都派来的飞机，流露出无限感激的神情。他拍完这个镜头以后说：从飞机送药到现在多少天了，我就想向党和毛主席表表心情，如今总算如愿了。
    县委积极地领导着这次拍摄的战斗，在寒风透骨的深夜，在波涛汹涌的黄河边，在风南公路的陡壁前，凡是摄制组拍摄重要场面时，都可以看到县委的书记们同导演站在一起，出谋划策。一次，县委扩大会议刚刚结束，会场立刻变成了“临时摄影棚”，全体县委委员变成了“演员”。当观众们看到这场戏中那些县委委员逼真的表演时，可曾想到他们是第一次上银幕的么？
    夜战黄河
    “誓以红心唱红旗”，成为摄制组人员的共同信念。在拍摄老艄公夜渡黄河这场戏的时候，导演、演员就是以老艄公那种英雄精神来表现这个英雄人物的。
    茅津渡口，两岸峭壁陡立，河水奔腾直泻，远远就听到了波涛的怒吼声。水面上虽然看不到惊涛骇浪，可是水深流急，一个漩涡，就可以把人打进河底！北影平陆摄制组在这奔腾的水面上展开了一场紧张的战斗。
    在像公园游艇那样的小船上，船头载着两个演员，中间是手举强光灯的照明工人，摄影师抱着机器站在船尾。小船被浪涛拍打着，摇晃着，由于负荷过重船尾下沉，船舱涌进了水，人们在跳到邻近准备好的大船上去的瞬间，摄影师把“老艄公”和“司药员”的紧张神态拍摄下来。
    平陆部分的戏拍好了，摄制组返回北京，路经茅津渡口，这时暮色苍茫，月光照耀得黄河好像一条翻腾呼啸的金蟒。导演、摄影师感到这个情景，比前一天拍的夜景更真实、动人，于是立即决定在上火车以前的一小时抢拍一个夜景。导演陈方千提着马灯，在对岸的水滩地上边跑边晃。天黑了，看不见道，他深一脚浅一脚地走着，滑到水里，爬起来，再跑。摄影师从这岸遥遥望去，马灯忽明忽暗，很像在远方闪烁着的星星之火。这个象征着小船上马灯忽隐忽现的场面，成为这部影片中一个很精采的镜头。
    在“录音室”、“洗印厂”里
    “战场”转移到录音室、剪辑室和北京电影洗印厂。
    在录音室、剪辑室里，人们打破了先把全片剪接完毕再录音的常规，展开了剪辑一段、录一段的“流水作业”。音乐家李焕之、瞿希贤、王震亚成为这里的忙人。根据瞿希贤的建议，影片中几段主要的旁白采用了歌唱形式。那反映时代脉搏的主题歌——“共产主义凯歌”刚一录完，立刻被它的第一批听众传唱开来。李焕之听过录音以后满意地说：虽然这次配曲的是三个人，分段担任，而且事先没看过样片，但是共同的政治热情，使共产主义风格大发扬这一主题像红线那样贯穿全曲，效果、节奏同剧情都很和谐。
    北京电影洗印厂五百多职工早在十几天前洗印第一批样片的时候，就实现了他们向北影提出的诺言：保证你们无后顾之忧。职工们用两小时二十分钟洗出第一批样片，把二十四小时洗印出样片的老纪录远远地甩在后面。他们在影片还未开拍的时候，就一边保证日常工作的进行，一边成立了洗印这部影片的总指挥部。每次洗印样片，全厂八个工序都展开了紧张的“接力赛”，不仅持续地保证了高速度、高质量，还通过这部影片的洗印，全面地带动了各项工作的跃进。
    30日，北京五十八家影院和俱乐部上映了这部影片。北京电影洗印厂赶洗的八百九十多个拷贝，将在4月5日以前发行全国。
    影片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的诞生，再一次告诉人们：在党的领导下，满腔热情地对待大跃进的现实生活，更坚决地贯彻执行群众路线，更好地实行共产主义大协作，就能又快又好地反映我们这个伟大的英雄时代！
