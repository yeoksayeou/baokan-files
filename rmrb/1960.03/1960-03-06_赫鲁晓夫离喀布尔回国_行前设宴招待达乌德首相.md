Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 5th March -- TASS reported from Kabul: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, and his entourage left friendly Afghanistan on the 5th, filled with the fraternal sentiments of the Afghan people, and flew back to Moscow.

Early in the morning of the 5th, Khrushchev, accompanied by Prime Minister Daoud and his entourage, went to Bagram Airport. The airport was decorated with the national flags of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, and honor guards lined up to bid farewell to the distinguished guests.

Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah, Marshal Shah Wali, First Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammed, Foreign Minister Naim, Speaker of the National Assembly Nuruzai, Afghan government personnel, senior officials of state organs, and others came to see Khrushchev off.

Khrushchev reviewed the honor guard and then approached the microphone to deliver a warm farewell speech.

Khrushchev said that during his visit to Kabul, he and the Afghan King, Prime Minister, and other members of the Afghan government had frank and friendly exchanges of views on extremely important international issues and Soviet-Afghan relations. During these sincere talks, both sides had a full understanding of the issues discussed and pointed out that direct contact between the leaders of the two countries was of great benefit to further strengthening mutual trust.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet-Afghan joint communiqué issued today will help the development of relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. This is a good foundation for further expanding the political, economic, and cultural ties between our two countries. "As we are about to depart, we express our deep conviction that the meetings and talks in Kabul will help strengthen the good neighborly and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan and consolidate peace in the Near and Middle East."

The Afghan King delivered a farewell speech to Khrushchev, saying: "Please convey to the Soviet people our assurances of harmony and friendship. Please also convey that our friendship is unbreakable."

Before his departure, Khrushchev held a banquet on the 4th to entertain Prime Minister Daoud.

Khrushchev said in his speech at the banquet that the Afghan government has consistently pursued a policy of neutrality and non-participation in military alliances, which helps to mobilize the strength of the entire Afghan nation to complete the most important domestic tasks and enhance Afghanistan's international prestige. This policy is in line with the national interests of the Afghan people and the Afghan government's desire to further strengthen political and economic independence. Khrushchev expressed his belief that all attempts to steer Afghanistan away from its neutral path and push it into military alliances will inevitably fail.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people fully understand the strong desire of the Afghan people and government to eliminate long-term backwardness and ensure national progress. The Soviet Union is always ready to provide Afghanistan with experience and is willing to provide Afghanistan with economic and technical assistance without any political conditions.

Khrushchev added that the Soviet government's policy towards Afghanistan has always been sincere and fraternal. Lenin, the great founder of the Soviet Union, paid great attention to and was interested in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. In the instructions to the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Russian Federal Republic to Afghanistan, which Lenin personally participated in drafting, he demanded that the development of friendship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan be the main goal of the work. The points elaborated in this instruction have now become the basis of the Soviet government's policy towards Afghanistan.

Khrushchev said that Afghan-Soviet friendship is strengthening and developing year by year. We believe that the historical significance of Afghan-Soviet cooperation lies in the fact that the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, with different political and economic systems, have set an example of peaceful coexistence and selfless cooperation.

Afghan Prime Minister Daoud said in his speech at the banquet that the long-standing friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union is based on mutual trust. He said that the feelings expressed by the Afghan people when meeting their Soviet friends once again demonstrate that the friendship between the two peoples is the foundation for further developing good-neighborly relations.

When talking about the Afghan government's foreign policy, Daoud pointed out that the important principles of the Afghan government's foreign policy are the principles of neutrality and independence. He said that Afghanistan has never allowed any country to interfere in its internal affairs. Afghanistan's relations with all countries are based on these principles.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th March -- TASS reported from Moscow: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, returned to Moscow by plane this afternoon after visiting Indonesia, India, Burma, and Afghanistan.

At Vnukovo Airport, Khrushchev was warmly welcomed by representatives from all walks of life in Moscow. Soviet party and government leaders who came to welcome him included: Aristov, Brezhnev, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Pospelov, and others.

After meeting with the welcomers, Khrushchev left the airport by car for the Lenin Central Stadium in Moscow to attend a mass rally held there.

    赫鲁晓夫离喀布尔回国
    行前设宴招待达乌德首相
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和随行人员5日满载阿富汗人民的兄弟盛意离开友好的阿富汗，乘飞机回莫斯科。
    5日一清早，赫鲁晓夫在达乌德首相的陪同下和随行人员到巴格拉姆机场。机场上装饰着苏阿两国国旗，仪仗队列队欢送贵宾。
    阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿、沙阿·华利元帅、第一副首相阿里·穆罕默德、外交大臣纳伊姆、国民议会议长努鲁塞、阿富汗政府人员、国家机关高级官员等人前来为赫鲁晓夫送行。
    赫鲁晓夫检阅了仪仗队，然后走近扩音器发表热情的告别谈话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在喀布尔访问期间，我们同阿富汗国王、首相以及阿富汗政府其他成员就极重要的国际问题和苏阿关系问题坦率友好地交换了意见。在这些诚恳会谈的过程中，双方对所讨论的问题有充分的互相谅解，并且指出，我们两国领导人的直接接触对进一步加强互相信任有很大好处。
    赫鲁晓夫说，今天发表的苏阿联合公报有助于苏联同阿富汗之间关系的发展。这是进一步扩大我们两国的政治、经济和文化联系的良好基础。“我们在临行时表示深信，喀布尔的会晤和会谈将有助于加强苏联同阿富汗的睦邻友好关系和巩固中近东和平。”
    阿富汗国王向赫鲁晓夫致告别词说：“请向苏联人民转达我们对和睦和友谊的保证。还请转达：我们的友谊是牢不可破的。”
    临行以前，赫鲁晓夫在4日举行宴会招待达乌德首相。
    赫鲁晓夫在宴会上发表讲话说，阿富汗政府始终不渝地奉行着中立和不参加军事联盟的政策，这种政策有助于动员阿富汗全国的力量来完成最重要的国内任务和提高阿富汗的国际威望。这种政策符合阿富汗人民的民族利益和阿富汗政府进一步加强政治、经济独立的愿望。赫鲁晓夫表示相信，想使阿富汗离开中立道路并把它推向军事联盟的一切企图必将遭到失败。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人完全理解阿富汗人民和政府对消除长期落后状况、保证民族进步的强烈愿望。苏联随时准备向阿富汗提供经验，并且愿意给阿富汗没有任何政治条件的经济和技术援助。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，苏联政府对阿富汗的政策始终是诚挚的、兄弟般的。苏联的伟大创始人列宁曾经对苏联和阿富汗的关系非常注意和感到兴趣。列宁曾经在直接参加起草的给俄罗斯联邦共和国驻阿富汗的全权代表的指示中要求把发展苏联同阿富汗的友谊作为主要的工作目标。这一指示所阐明的各点现在已经成了苏联政府对阿富汗的政策的基础。
    赫鲁晓夫说，阿富汗—苏联的友谊一年比一年地加强和发展。我们认为，阿富汗—苏联合作的历史意义就在于具有不同政治和经济制度的苏联和阿富汗作出了和平共处和无私合作的榜样。
    阿富汗首相达乌德在宴会上讲话时说，阿富汗和苏联之间的多年友谊是建立在互相信任的基础上的。他说，阿富汗人民在会见苏联朋友时所表达的感情再次表明，两国人民的友谊是进一步发展睦邻关系的基础。
    达乌德谈到阿富汗政府外交政策时指出，阿富汗政府外交政策的重要原则是中立和独立的原则。他说，阿富汗从来也不允许任何国家干涉它的内政。阿富汗同所有国家的关系正是建立在这种原则的基础上的。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在访问印度尼西亚、印度、缅甸和阿富汗之后，在今天下午乘飞机回到莫斯科。
    在伏努科夫机场上，赫鲁晓夫受到了莫斯科各界代表的热烈欢迎。前来这里欢迎他的苏联党政领导人有：阿里斯托夫、勃列日涅夫、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、科兹洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、波斯别洛夫等人。
    赫鲁晓夫同欢迎者见面后，乘车离开机场前往莫斯科列宁中央运动场，参加在那里举行的群众欢迎大会。
