    Khrushchev requested that this notification be conveyed to French President de Gaulle, and expressed his extreme regret that he could not make a state visit to France on the originally scheduled date.
    According to the diagnosis of the attending physician, Khrushchev's cold requires seven to ten days to recover. Therefore, Khrushchev proposed to de Gaulle that the date of the visit be postponed by seven to ten days.

    赫鲁晓夫延期访法
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联驻法国大使受苏联政府委托12日晚间通知法国外交部：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫因患流行性感冒不能在3月15日到达巴黎。
    赫鲁晓夫请求把这个通知转达给法国总统戴高乐，并且对他不能在原定日期到法国作国事访问表示极为遗憾。
    据主治医生诊断，赫鲁晓夫的感冒需要七天至十天才能好。因此，赫鲁晓夫向戴高乐提议把访问的日期推迟七天至十天。
    法兰西共和国总统接到这个通知后表示遗憾，并请求向苏联部长会议主席转达：他祝赫鲁晓夫早日痊愈。双方商定，关于赫鲁晓夫到达巴黎的准确日期将由两国政府尽速商定。
