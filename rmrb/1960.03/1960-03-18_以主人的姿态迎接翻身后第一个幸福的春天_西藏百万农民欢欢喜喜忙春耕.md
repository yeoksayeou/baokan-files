    With the Attitude of Masters, Welcome the First Happy Spring After Emancipation
    A Million Tibetan Peasants Joyfully Busy with Spring Plowing
    More than 100,000 Pieces of Farm Tools Improved Throughout the Region; Main Agricultural Areas Expand Cultivated Land by More Than 50,000 *Ke* (*Ke* is a unit of area roughly equivalent to *mu*)
    (Our Lhasa dispatch, March 17th) As the spring warms and the snow melts on the Tibetan Plateau, and the earth thaws, a million Tibetan peasants, now emancipated, are launching a vigorous spring plowing and sowing campaign to welcome this year's bumper agricultural harvest.
    Now, at every dawn, the vast countryside boils with activity. Peasants in groups lead their cattle to the fields. As the morning sun rises, tens of thousands of *ke* of fertile land are awakened by iron plows. The peasants hang red tassels, symbolizing joy, on the horns of the oxen and light pine smoke at the edge of the fields to celebrate their joyful mood as they begin their first spring plowing as masters of the land.
    In Lhasa and Shannan, the main agricultural areas of Tibet, this year's spring plowing began more than half a month earlier than in the past, and the speed of progress is also unprecedented. Currently, most of the land has been plowed two or three times to a depth of seven or eight inches to over a foot. The plowed land is being leveled and irrigated at an accelerated pace, and the peasants are striving to complete all spring plowing within ten days to seize the favorable time for spring sowing. This year's spring plowing in these two agricultural areas is being carried out with particular care. Past fallow land and previously abandoned corners of fields have been plowed and utilized, increasing the cultivated area by more than 50,000 *ke* compared to last year. In the warmer climates of Nyingchi, Bomi, and Yadong, spring sowing is nearing completion, and the early-sown wheat, highland barley, and rapeseed are growing vigorously. The Tibetan peasants there are watering, topdressing, and strengthening field management. In Qamdo, Xigaze, Gyantse, and Ngari, where thawing is later, efforts are being stepped up to transport fertilizer, repair canals, select seeds, and vigorously engage in preparatory work for plowing.
    During spring plowing and sowing, Party organizations at all levels in the countryside have fully mobilized and organized the masses, launching competitions and collaborations, conducting timely inspections and evaluations, and providing specific assistance to farmers' associations and agricultural production mutual aid teams in various villages. They have repeatedly studied and revised patriotic production increase plans and measures, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the emancipated Tibetan peasants. Many peasants have proposed to double this year's agricultural output compared to last year, and are carrying out production competitions for "thousand-jin villages" and "thousand-jin teams." At the same time, each farmers' association will also cultivate large areas of high-yield fields of several hundred *ke*.
    Before the spring plowing and sowing, thorough preparations were made in the rural areas. In the preparatory work, close attention was paid to water, soil, fertilizer, seeds, and farm tool reform, and significant achievements were made.
    In the past, under the rule of feudal serfdom, Tibetan peasants lived in poverty. "After threshing highland barley, their hands were empty, and they had no grain throughout the year," resulting in low morale. Generally, land was not fertilized, and even the fields near the residences of feudal lords were only fertilized with 100 to 200 *jin* per *ke*. This past winter and spring, in areas that have undergone democratic reforms, the production enthusiasm of the emancipated peasants has soared to unprecedented levels, and a high tide of manure accumulation and composting has been launched in rural areas. Under the leadership of the Party, the emancipated peasants have acted together, working day and night to accumulate human and animal manure, and vigorously engage in making compost, smoked manure, bone meal, and soil fertilizer. In Zhanang County in Shannan alone, 160 soil fertilizer plants were established, producing 780,000 *jin* of soil fertilizer. Since the beginning of spring, peasants have transported over 7 billion *jin* of base fertilizer to the fields. At the same time, a million emancipated Tibetan peasants have worked hard throughout the winter and spring, toiling day and night to build water conservancy projects by splitting mountains and filling rivers. In the agricultural areas of Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, Xigaze, and Qamdo alone, more than 10,400 canals and 1,500 reservoirs and ponds have been newly built, expanding the irrigated area by more than 200,000 *ke*. The irrigated area of farmland in Lhasa, Shannan, and Xigaze has reached over 90%.
    During the preparatory work, blacksmiths and carpenters in various parts of Tibet were organized to work with the masses to carry out farm tool reform. As of the end of February, more than 100,000 pieces of farm tools had been improved throughout Tibet. These farm tools have played a significant role in spring plowing and sowing, accelerating the speed of spring plowing and sowing.
    Peasants in various places have selected good seeds before spring plowing. This year, the amount of seeds sown per *ke* will be increased by two to three *sheng* compared to the past to allow for appropriate dense planting. (Image attached)

### 以主人的姿态迎接翻身后第一个幸福的春天  西藏百万农民欢欢喜喜忙春耕

    以主人的姿态迎接翻身后第一个幸福的春天
    西藏百万农民欢欢喜喜忙春耕
    全区改革农具十万多件，主要农业区扩大耕地面积五万多克
    本报拉萨17日电　西藏高原春暖雪消，大地解冻，翻身后的百万藏族农民为迎接今年农业生产的大丰收掀起了春耕、春播的热潮。
    现在，每当黎明，广大农村就沸腾起来，农民们成群结队?喝着耕牛走向田野，当朝阳升起时，上万克（一克相当于一亩）肥沃的土地已在铁犁下苏醒过来。农民们把象征喜庆的红缨挂在牛角上，在田头燃起了预祝丰收的松烟，表示他们成为土地的主人后开始第一个春耕的欢乐心情。
    西藏主要农业区的拉萨和山南今年的春耕工作比过去提前了半个多月，进展的速度也是空前的。目前，绝大部分的土地已翻耕了两三遍，深达七八寸到一尺以上。翻耕过的土地正在加紧平整和春灌，农民们争取在十天内全部完成春耕，抓紧大好时光进行春播。今年这两个农业区的春耕工作做得特别精细。过去的休闲地和一向荒废的田头地角都加以翻耕利用，耕地面积较去年扩大了五万多克。气候温暖的林芝、波密和亚东等地，春播即将结束，早播的小麦、青稞、油菜已长得很茁壮，那里的藏族农民正在浇水追肥，加强田间管理。解冻较晚的昌都、日喀则、江孜和阿里地区，目前正在加紧运肥、修渠、选种，大搞备耕活动。
    春耕春播中，党在农村中的各级组织充分地发动和组织了群众，大搞竞赛协作，及时检查评比，具体帮助各乡农民协会和各农业生产互助组，反复研究和修订了爱国增产计划和措施，大大地鼓舞了西藏翻身农民的生产干劲。许多农民提出要让今年的农业产量比去年翻一番，并开展千斤乡和千斤组的生产竞赛，同时，每个农民协会还要搞几百克土地的大面积丰产田。
    春耕春播前，各地农村都进行了充分的备耕工作。备耕工作中，狠狠抓住了水、土、肥、种和农具改革，并取得了很大的成绩。
    过去，西藏农民在封建农奴制度统治下，生活困苦，“打完青稞两手光，一年四季没有粮”，生产情绪低落。一般的土地都不施肥，封建领主住宅附近的田地里每克地也仅施肥一、二百斤。去冬今春，经过民主改革的地方，翻身农民生产热情空前高涨，各地农村掀起了积肥、造肥的高潮。翻身农民在党的领导下，一齐行动起来，日夜突击，挖积人粪、畜粪，并大搞沤肥、熏肥、骨肥和土化肥，仅山南札囊县就办起了一百六十个土化肥厂，制造了七十八万斤土化肥。入春以来，农民们已把七十多亿斤基肥运送到了地里。与此同时，西藏百万翻身农民们还大干一冬，苦战一春，披星戴月，劈山填河大兴水利。仅拉萨、山南、林芝、日喀则、昌都等农业区就新修起一万零四百多条水渠和一千五百多个水库、水塘，扩大灌溉面积二十多万克。拉萨、山南、日喀则的农田水利灌溉面积已达到了90％以上。
    备耕中，西藏各地的铁工、木工都组织起来和群众一道大搞农具改革。截至2月底，西藏全区已改革农具十万多件。这些农具在春耕春播中都发挥了很大的作用，加快了春耕春播的速度。
    各地农民在春耕前都选好了良种，今年每克地播种的种籽要比以往增多二、三升，以便适当密植。（附图片）
