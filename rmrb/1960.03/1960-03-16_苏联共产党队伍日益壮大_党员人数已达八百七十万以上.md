    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: An article published in the latest issue (Issue 5) of the Soviet magazine "Party Life" states that as of January 1st this year, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has 8,017,000 full members and 691,000 probationary members. Among them, more than one million are new members with a Party standing of no more than three years.

    The article writes that since the 20th Congress of the CPSU (1956), the local organizations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have greatly improved the work of adjusting the composition of Party members. For example, in 1956, the proportion of worker Party members in the Party's probationary members reached 59.5%, and by 1959 it had increased to 65.4%. In Omsk and Kurgan regions, people of worker and collective farm member origin accounted for more than 84% of the probationary members. Among the staff members admitted to the Party last year, experts in industry, agriculture, and other sectors of the national economy accounted for 65.2%, and most of these experts were formerly workers and peasants.

    The number of rural Party members is also increasing rapidly. For example, when the Ryazan region vigorously developed animal husbandry production last year, it greatly expanded the work of recruiting Party members from among animal husbandry workers.

    The article says that many regions are now paying attention to recruiting advanced producers from important industrial sectors into the Party. The proportion of women among newly admitted Party members has also increased. For example, women accounted for 17.7% of the Party members admitted last year, which is much higher than in 1958.

    苏联共产党队伍日益壮大
    党员人数已达八百七十万以上
    新华社莫斯科15日电　最近一期（第五期）苏联“党的生活”杂志发表的一篇文章说，截至今年1月1日为止，苏联共产党已有八百零一万七千名正式党员和六十九万一千名预备党员。其中有一百多万名党龄不超过三年的新党员。
    文章写道，苏共第二十次代表大会（1956年）以后，苏联共产党各地方组织大大改善了调整党员成分的工作。例如，在1956年工人党员在全党的预备党员中所占的比重已达59．5％，到1959年则增加到65．4％，而在鄂木斯克、库尔干州的预备党员中，工人和集体农庄庄员出身的人已占84％以上。在去年吸收入党的职员中，工农业和国民经济其它部门的专家占65．2％，而这些专家绝大部分从前都是工人和庄员。
    农村党员也在迅速增加着。例如，梁赞州去年大搞畜牧业生产时大大扩大了在畜牧工作者中吸收党员的工作。
    文章说，许多地区现在都在注意吸收重要工业部门中的先进生产者入党。在新吸收的党员中，妇女占的比重也有增加。例如，去年吸收的党员中，妇女占17．7％，这比1958年增加了很多。
