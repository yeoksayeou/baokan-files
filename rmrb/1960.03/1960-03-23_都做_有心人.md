All Should Strive to be "People with Initiative"
Jiang Hui

Currently, the mass movement for technical innovation and technical revolution is developing vigorously across the country. The worker and peasant masses are the main force in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Learning culture, science, and technology has become a matter of utmost urgency for the worker and peasant masses. Since liberation, the worker and peasant masses have become masters of the country, their lives improving steadily, and the Party has provided them with excellent learning conditions. Under the Party's cultivation and education, the cultural, scientific, and technological levels of the broad worker and peasant masses have gradually improved, and their intelligence and talents have begun to be brought into play. Many workers and peasants who have come from laboring backgrounds, through diligent self-study, have become both red and expert worker-peasant intellectuals. The deeds of Gou Wenbin, the deputy director of the Chongqing Enamel Factory, who is featured in this newspaper today, is a good example of the worker and peasant masses advancing towards culture, science, and technology.

The deeds of Gou Wenbin's diligent self-study prove that the worker and peasant masses can completely conquer the fortresses of culture, science, and technology, and become masters of culture and science. Some people believe that culture, science, and technology are profound and unpredictable, and that "roughnecks" dare not touch them. This kind of inferiority complex is undesirable. It is true that the worker and peasant masses have difficulties learning a relatively systematic and complex set of cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge today because they have lacked education for a long time. However, cultural and scientific knowledge is ultimately the crystallization of the struggle for production and the class struggle, originally created by the working people. Because the worker and peasant masses have relatively rich experience in the struggle for production and the class struggle, they have an advantage in learning compared to young students. The superstitious idea that "roughnecks" dare not touch culture and science must be broken. Otherwise, the worker and peasant masses not learning culture will seriously affect the speed of technical innovation and technical revolution, and the speed of national construction. Of course, no one is "born knowing." Anyone, from ignorance to knowledge, must go through a process of diligent learning. If one is discouraged by difficulties because they cannot learn something at once, the result will be that they will never learn it. The key here is determination. There is an old Chinese saying: "Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it." Gou Wenbin is such a "person with initiative." When he began to study culture and science on his own, formulas, elements, and theorems were like a jumble in his brain; he couldn't remember them or learn them. However, when the Party pointed out to him that the working class must master culture and science in order to carry out the great cause of changing the world, he made up his mind that no matter how great the difficulties, he would not waver. With determination, he also found the knack for learning. If he couldn't remember what he learned, he would study it repeatedly to deepen his impression; if he was busy with work and had little time, he would find ways to squeeze in time to study; if he didn't understand something, he would think hard about it or ask others for advice. Gou Wenbin persevered in his diligent self-study, day after day for ten years, and finally conquered the fortress of culture and science. Let us all learn from Gou Wenbin's spirit of perseverance and fearlessness in learning, and all strive to be "people with initiative," to master culture, science, and technology more quickly, and to accelerate the socialist construction of our motherland.

    都做“有心人”
    江晖
    现在，全国技术革新和技术革命的群众运动正轰轰烈烈的开展。工农群众是技术革新和技术革命运动中的主力军。学习文化科学和技术，已经成为工农群众当前刻不容缓的大事。解放以来，工农群众成了国家的主人，生活步步上升，党为他们准备下极好的学习条件。广大工农群众在党的培养教育下，文化科学和技术水平逐步提高，他们的聪明才智开始得到发挥，不少工农出身的劳动者，刻苦自学，已经成为又红又专的工农知识分子。今天本报发表的重庆搪瓷厂副厂长苟文彬刻苦自学的事迹，就是工农群众向文化科学和技术进军的好榜样。
    苟文彬刻苦自学的事迹证明，工农群众完全可以攻破文化科学技术的堡垒，成为文化科学的主人。有人认为，文化科学和技术高深莫测，“大老粗”不敢去碰，这种自卑心理是要不得的。工农群众由于长期没有文化，今天要来学一套较系统的复杂的文化科学技术知识是有困难的。但是文化科学知识归根到底是生产斗争和阶级斗争的结晶，原本是劳动人民创造的，工农群众由于有较丰富的生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验，学习起来比之青年学生，又有他们有利的一面。“大老粗”不敢碰文化科学这种迷信观念必须破除。否则，工农群众不学文化就会严重地影响技术革新和技术革命的速度，和国家建设的速度。当然，人非“生而知之”，任何人从无知到有知，都要经过刻苦学习的过程。如果因为一时学不会就被困难吓退，那么，其结果是永远学不会。这里关键在于决心。中国有一句老话：“世上无难事，只怕有心人”。苟文彬便是一个“有心人”。他在开始自学文化科学的时候，什么公式、元素、定理，脑子里像一团乱麻，记不住也学不会。可是，当党向他指出：工人阶级要干改天换地的伟大事业，一定要掌握文化科学，他就下了决心，多大的困难也不动摇。有了决心，也找到了学习的窍门。学了记不住，他就三番四复地学，加深印象；工作忙，时间少，他就想法挤时间学；学不懂，就苦苦思考，或者请教别人。苟文彬这样不懈不怠地刻苦自学，十年如一日，终于攻破了文化科学的堡垒。让我们都来学习苟文彬那种坚毅不拔大无畏的学习精神，都来做一个“有心人”，更快地掌握文化科学和技术，加速进行我们祖国的社会主义建设。
