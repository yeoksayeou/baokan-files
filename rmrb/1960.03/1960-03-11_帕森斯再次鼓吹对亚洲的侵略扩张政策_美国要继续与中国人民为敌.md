Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 9th— Parsons, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, once again delivered a speech hostile to the new China before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 8th.

Parsons asked the U.S. Congress to approve the U.S. government's "Mutual Security Program" (i.e., "aid" to foreign countries) for the 1961 fiscal year in order to support the reactionary regimes in Asia under the U.S.'s wing and be hostile to the new China. In order to get American taxpayers to contribute large sums of money to support this policy of aggression, he used a large part of his speech to repeat the anti-communist cliches of China's "aggression" and "threat to free Asian countries" while turning black into white. He also demanded that the U.S. continue to implement its current policy towards Asia, a policy centered on hostility towards China. He said that the United States only had two mutually exclusive policies before it: either continue to take actions "necessary to contain or defeat the aggression of Communist China," or put forward suggestions that would be regarded by China and other Asian countries as "weak or exhausted." Parsons emphasized that "the United States has no intention whatsoever of even considering the latter policy."

Parsons admitted that "it seems clear that in the coming decades, Communist China may become one of the important countries in terms of overall economic development, especially the development of heavy industry," and that "the situation regarding Communist China is as tricky as ever" (for the United States). Parsons believes that the United States must "constantly keep in mind" the "challenge of Communist China in the 1960s." He concluded: "Considering the prospect of further development of Communist China's strength, the future importance of the Mutual Security Program becomes even clearer."

Parsons particularly emphasized the importance of strengthening military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam. He called them "indispensable forces in America's forward defense strategy" and believed that it was urgently necessary to "maintain" and "refresh" these forces.

    帕森斯再次鼓吹对亚洲的侵略扩张政策
    美国要继续与中国人民为敌
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责远东事务助理国务卿帕森斯8日在美国众议院外交委员会又一次发表敌视新中国的演说。
    帕森斯要求美国国会批准美国政府1961财政年度的“共同安全计划”（即“援”外计划），以支持美国卵翼下的亚洲反动政权，来和新中国为敌。为了要美国纳税人拿出大量金钱来支持这一侵略政策，他在演说中用很大篇幅颠倒黑白地重复中国“侵略”、“威胁亚洲自由国家”的反共滥调，并且要求坚持执行美国目前对亚洲的政策，即以敌视中国为中心的政策。他说：美国面前只有两种非此即彼的政策，要末继续采取“为遏止或击败共产党中国的侵略”所必需的行动，要末就只有提出会被中国和其他亚洲国家认为是“软弱或疲惫”的建议。帕森斯强调说，“美国一点也不想那怕是考虑一下后一种政策”。
    帕森斯承认，“看来很明显，在今后的年代中，从总的经济发展、特别是重工业发展来看，共产党中国可能成为重要国家之一”，“关于共产党中国的情况（对美国）像以前一样棘手”。帕森斯认为美国要把新中国在“六十年代的挑战”“经常放在心上”。他作出结论说：“考虑到共产党中国力量进一步发展的前景，共同安全计划今后的重要性也就显得更清楚了。”
    帕森斯特别强调加强对台湾蒋介石集团、南朝鲜李承晚集团和南越吴庭艳集团军事援助的重要性。他把它们称为“美国前沿防御战略必不可少的部队”，认为迫切需要“维持”和“刷新”这些部队。
