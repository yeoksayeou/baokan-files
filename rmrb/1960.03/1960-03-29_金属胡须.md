    Metal Whiskers

    Do you know the strength of ordinary copper and iron wires? A copper wire with a cross-sectional area of one square millimeter can be broken by applying only 40 kilograms of pulling force. An iron wire of the same thickness can be broken by applying only 60 kilograms of pulling force. In recent years, due to production needs, metallurgical workers have been striving to improve the strength of metals. They have adopted two methods: one is to add strength enhancers—alloy elements—to steel; the other is to implement heat treatment to cause changes in the crystals within the metal that are conducive to increased strength. After a series of efforts, the strength of metals has increased approximately eight to ten times compared to the past. Currently, the tensile strength of ultra-high-strength steel has reached over 320 kilograms per square millimeter.
    However, at the same time, physicists, based on the coupling theory between metal atoms, pointed out from calculations that the strength of ordinary metals could be increased by a thousand times compared to the existing highest strength. “A thousand times!” This figure greatly surprised metallurgical workers, who, despite trying every means, only achieved 1% of this figure. Thus, some began to study the reasons why the actual strength of metals differed so much from the theoretical strength. Later, the reason was found: it was due to dislocations in the crystal structure of actual metals. With the help of electron microscopes, people discovered that all metals smelted using existing methods had dislocations. Because dislocations occur in the crystal structure that makes up the metal, it cannot strongly resist external forces, causing its strength to plummet. Therefore, if dislocations in the metal can be eliminated, it can have the strength it should have, which is the same as the theoretical value. Currently, this dislocation-free metal has been born in the laboratory.
    In 1952, someone observed in the laboratory that the fine metal wires made in special equipment, when their diameter was as small as one micron (one-thousandth of a millimeter), their strength approached the theoretical value. These fine wires, only one-seventieth the thickness of a human hair, are called metal whiskers. Further research revealed that metal whiskers only have theoretical strength when they are this thin. When their diameter is increased to ten to twenty microns, their strength is almost the same as the actual strength. This situation requires metallurgists to further investigate the reasons why metal whiskers have high strength and how to increase their diameter without affecting the decrease in strength.
    Although this problem has not yet been well resolved, and metal whiskers are certainly not yet ready to enter the stage of mass production, the research situation has opened the door to the secrets of metal strength for metallurgical workers. When they were struggling to increase the strength of metals many times over, the appearance of metal whiskers opened up a new world for them.
    We can imagine that in an era of mass production of metals with a strength a thousand times higher than the current one, how light and strong all the heavy machinery and buildings will be, and the service life will be at least ten times longer than now! Bridges made of metal wire will replace heavy steel bridges, television towers will soar into the clouds...

    金属胡须
    王俊夫
    你了解普通铜丝和铁丝的强度吗？断面面积是一平方毫米的铜丝只需加上四十公斤的拉力就能拉断它，同样粗细的铁丝也只需加上六十公斤的拉力就能拉断它。近年来由于生产上的需要，冶金工作者一直在努力提高金属的强度。他们采用的方法有两个，一是在钢铁中加入强度增强剂——合金元素；另一个办法是实行热处理，使金属内的晶体发生有利强度增高的变化。经过一系列的努力后，金属强度比过去大约提高了八倍到十倍。目前超高级强度钢的抗拉强度已达到每平方毫米三百二十公斤以上。
    然而与此同时，物理学家根据金属原子间的偶合理论从计算结果中指出，普通金属的强度能比现有的最高强度提高一千倍。“一千倍！”这个数字使冶金工作者们大为惊讶，他们想尽了办法，却只达到这个数字的1％。于是就有人开始去研究金属的实际强度与理论强度相差如此之远的原因，后来原因被查明了，原来这是由于实际金属的晶体结构中发生错位所造成的。人们通过电子显微镜的帮助，发现所有用现有方法冶炼出来的金属都有错位产生。由于组成金属的晶体结构中产生了错位，就使得它不能很坚强地抵抗外力，致使它的强度一落千丈。因此，如果能够消除金属中的错位，那么就能使它具有应有的、和理论值相同的强度了。目前这种无错位的金属已经在实验室中诞生了。
    1952年，有人在实验室中观察到在特殊的设备中所作出的金属细丝，当它的直径小到一微米（千分之一毫米）时，它的强度就接近于理论的数值。这种粗细只及一根头发丝的七十分之一的细丝，人们称它为金属胡须。进一步研究发现，金属胡须只有在这样细的情况下才具有理论的强度，当把它的直径增大到十至二十微米时，它的强度又跟实际的强度差不多了。这种情况使得金属学家们必须进一步去追究金属胡须具有高强度的原因以及如何能把它的直径增大而不影响强度降低的方法。
    目前这个问题虽然还没有很好的解决，金属胡须当然还不能走入大量生产的舞台。但是研究的情况已经给冶金工作者打开了金属强度秘密的大门。当他们苦于不能成倍地提高金属强度的时候，金属胡须的出现在他们面前开辟了新的天地。
    我们可以想像，在大批生产强度比现在高一千倍的金属的时代里，一切笨重的机器与建筑物将是如何地轻巧和牢固，使用的寿命至少比现在提高十几倍！金属丝做的大桥将代替笨重的钢桥，电视塔将高耸入云霄……。
