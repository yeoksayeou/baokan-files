Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 20th: The various units within Hefei's cultural and educational system are vigorously promoting a communist style of cooperation. The noble spirit of "You help me, I help you, support each other, promote each other," "Giving convenience to others, leaving the difficulties to oneself," and "One flower does not make a spring, a riot of color makes spring" has become a common practice. The great cooperation has powerfully promoted the sustained great leap forward in cultural and educational work.

The great cooperation in Hefei's cultural and educational departments was launched under the situation of the Great Leap Forward. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party resolutely implemented the policy of cultural and educational work serving proletarian politics, serving socialist construction, and "walking on two legs." Cultural and educational undertakings have greatly developed and improved in both quantity and quality. Cultural and educational units are running factories and farms on a large scale, and factories and communes are running schools, health, and cultural undertakings on a large scale. In the past, general units lacked experience in these newly established undertakings. In addition to actively creating conditions themselves, they urgently needed assistance from professional units. The broad masses of intellectuals on the cultural and educational front have also further improved their political and ideological awareness through the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, and they are eager to carry out cooperation within the same industry to improve their professional level. At the same time, they also demand cooperation with production departments and other departments in order to better integrate with production and serve production. Under this situation, the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to extensively carry out communist great cooperation in the city's cultural and educational front in a led, planned, organized, and purposeful manner to meet the needs of the new situation. As a result, schools, hospitals, and theater troupes cooperated with factories and communes, schools cooperated with schools, urban hospitals supported commune hospitals, and professional theater troupes helped amateur theater troupes, quickly forming a broad cooperative network in the city covering cultural and educational departments, cultural and educational departments and industrial and agricultural production departments, urban cultural and educational units and rural cultural and educational units, and professional cultural and educational units and amateur cultural and educational units.

The forms and content of the communist great cooperation carried out on Hefei's cultural and educational front are constantly developing and improving in the process of practice. The scope of cooperation has expanded from within a single unit to between units of the same profession and between units of different professions. The content of cooperation has expanded from experience exchange, technical support, and equipment support to all aspects of the entire work process. The forms of cooperation are also diverse, among which the main ones are: counterpart pairing cooperation, contracted cooperation, and regional cooperation.

Counterpart pairing cooperation is the establishment of mutual support relations between two units of the same or different professions in certain aspects of their work. According to statistics from the city's urban and suburban areas, fifteen middle schools are respectively paired with fifteen factories, eleven middle schools are paired with communes, twenty-two hospitals and medical colleges are respectively paired with seventy communes, and three professional theater troupes are paired with seventeen factories. They support and cooperate with each other. For example, when schools are paired with factories, factories support schools in running factories, and schools help factories in running schools. After many schools were paired with factories, the schools organized teachers and students to participate in labor in the factories during some of the prescribed labor time, conducted physics and chemistry experiments in conjunction with labor, and at the same time helped the factories to carry out spare-time education and other cultural activities; factory technicians went to the factories run by the schools to provide technical guidance and help the schools make teaching aids (blowers, motors, etc.).

Contracted cooperation is when one unit contracts for another unit within its business scope. For example, Anhui Medical College contracts for the Hechao Commune Hospital, not only providing business guidance and technical strength and medical equipment support, but also being responsible for treating diseases that the commune hospital cannot treat. The Provincial Hospital sends medical staff with higher medical skills to the Changlinhe Commune Hospital in Feidong to directly help these hospitals to independently handle general surgery. In addition to hospitals, this form of cooperation has also begun to be carried out by schools for factories and communes.

Cooperation zones are collaborations between cultural and educational units of the same profession in the same region, such as cultural cooperation zones, teaching cooperation zones (tutoring zones), and sports cooperation zones. So far, middle schools and above in the urban area have organized three school cooperation zones, with fifteen participating schools and seven hundred and forty-eight teachers. Sixteen urban cultural cooperation zones have been established, with 139 participating units including factories, agencies, and schools, with a total of 10,565 people. There are nine sports cooperation zones, including more than eighty grassroots units. The units in the cooperation zone support each other, exchange what one has for what one needs, and improve together. After the establishment of the teaching cooperation zone, it not only played a great role in improving teaching quality, but also suburban middle schools provided urban middle school students with production areas, and urban middle schools helped suburban middle schools solve the difficulty of insufficient teaching instruments. Some teaching instruments that still cannot be resolved in this cooperation zone are also exchanged between cooperation zones.

Through great cooperation, the development of the number and the improvement of the quality of cultural and educational undertakings have been greatly accelerated. State-run hospitals are paired with communes, helping communes to establish many medical institutions. Schools, due to the establishment of teaching cooperation zones, focused on lesson preparation, open teaching, and exchange of teaching experience, improved the business level of teachers, and solved difficulties in teaching. For example, the second cooperation zone of middle schools is composed of nine suburban schools. Most of them are newly built schools, and 80% of the teachers are new and lack teaching experience. After the establishment of the cooperation zone, seven teaching research groups were established according to the subjects, and forty-seven teaching activities were held within half a year. Based on the spirit of mutual learning and mutual assistance between new and old teachers, teaching research was carried out, and the business level of new teachers was rapidly improved. The City Opera Troupe used to have poor martial arts skills. After the Provincial Peking Opera Troupe helped them practice their skills, many dramas with martial arts elements can be performed. They said: "Without the help of the Peking Opera Troupe, the quality of our performances would not have improved so quickly." The actors of the Peking Opera Troupe also improved themselves by tutoring others.

Great cooperation has enabled the Party's cultural and educational policy to be rapidly implemented and has promoted cultural and educational work to be better integrated with production and serve production. After the East District Private Vocational Middle School was paired with eight local state-owned factories in the district, in addition to leaving some students in the school factory for internships, the remaining 400 students were assigned to factory workshops in batches to study. Now, 95% of the students have basically mastered various techniques such as forging and riveting, casting, metalworking, woodworking, modeling, sheet metal, wire drawing, and embroidery. Some have been able to turn sand-casting parts and independently perform production operations such as tables and chairs. Through great literary and artistic cooperation, great production cooperation has also been promoted. For example, after the establishment of the Aviation Road Literary and Artistic Cooperation Zone in the Railway Station District, the workers of eight factories often held parties and performed on the same stage, and their relationship became closer. During the Spring Festival, the Kangle Malt Sugar Factory, which participated in this literary and artistic cooperation zone, had tight tasks and lacked cutting boards, and the woodworking factory rushed to make them overnight, so that they overfulfilled their production tasks.

Great cooperation has also strengthened the connection between intellectuals and workers and peasants and promoted the ideological transformation of intellectuals. Due to the development of cooperation, the spirit of collectivism has been greatly promoted. In the beginning, some units had individualistic and departmentalistic ideas such as "fear of trouble" and "fear of suffering losses." Through cooperation, they personally experienced that cooperation played a role in learning from each other's strengths, helping each other, and promoting each other, thus showing many vivid examples of "putting others before oneself and sacrificing oneself for others." For example, the Hefei Printing Factory sent three technicians to the Hefei No. 3 Middle School Printing Factory to teach technology, helped 50 students learn typesetting and other technologies, and gave the best disc machine to the No. 3 Middle School to help the No. 3 Middle School Printing Factory solve the difficulty of insufficient equipment. The No. 3 Middle School also transferred Chinese and history teachers to the printing factory to serve as teachers in the workers' spare-time school and used the prescribed labor time to organize students to help the Hefei Printing Factory solve the problem of insufficient labor.

### 你帮我　我帮你　互通有无　共同跃进  合肥文教系统大兴协作之风  加速了文教事业的发展，促进了党的文教方针迅速贯彻

    你帮我　我帮你　互通有无　共同跃进
    合肥文教系统大兴协作之风
    加速了文教事业的发展，促进了党的文教方针迅速贯彻
    新华社合肥20日电　合肥市文教系统中各单位之间，大兴共产主义协作之风。“你帮我、我帮你、互相支援、互相促进”，“把方便让给别人、把困难留给自己”，“一朵鲜花不是春、万紫千红才是春”的高尚风格已蔚为风气。大协作有力地推动了文教工作的持续大跃进。
    合肥文教部门的大协作，是在大跃进的形势下开展起来的，大跃进以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，中共合肥市委坚决地贯彻执行了文教工作为无产阶级政治服务、为社会主义建设服务和“两条腿走路”的方针，文教事业在数量上和质量上有了很大的发展和提高。文教单位大办工厂、农场，工厂、公社大办学校、卫生和文化事业。对这些新办事业，一般单位过去都缺乏经验，除了本身积极创造条件外，还迫切需要专业单位予以协助。文教战线上的广大知识分子，经过整风运动及反右派斗争，政治思想觉悟也进一步提高，迫切要求同行业之间开展协作，来提高业务水平，同时也要求和生产部门及其他部门协作，以便更好地和生产结合，为生产服务。在这种形势下，中共合肥市委决定在全市文教战线上有领导、有计划、有组织、有目的地广泛地开展共产主义大协作，以适应新的形势的需要。于是，学校、医院、剧团和工厂、公社协作，学校和学校协作，市区医院支援公社医院，专业剧团帮助业余剧团，在全市范围内很快形成了一个文教部门之间、文教部门与工农业生产部门之间、市区文教单位与农村文教单位之间、专业文教单位与业余文教单位之间的广泛的协作网。
    合肥文教战线开展共产主义大协作的形式和内容，是在实践过程中不断发展不断提高的。协作的范围，从一个单位内部扩展到同一专业的单位之间和不同专业的单位之间。协作的内容，从经验交流、技术支援、设备支援，扩展到整个工作过程的各个方面。协作的形式也多种多样，其中主要的有：对口挂钩协作、包干协作和地区协作等三种形式。
    对口挂钩协作，就是同一专业或不同专业的两个单位在业务的某些方面，建立相互支援的联系。据这个市的市区和郊区统计，有十五个中等学校分别与十五个工厂挂钩，有十一个中等学校与公社挂钩，有二十二个医院和医学院校分别与七十个公社挂钩，三个专业剧团与十七个工厂挂钩。他们相互支援，相互协作。如学校和工厂挂钩，工厂支援学校办工厂，学校帮助工厂办学校。许多学校与工厂挂钩后，学校组织师生利用一部分规定的劳动时间到工厂参加劳动，结合劳动进行物理、化学实验，同时帮助工厂开展业余教育和其他文化活动；工厂技术人员到学校办的工厂进行技术指导，帮助学校制教具（鼓风机、电动机等）。
    包干协作，是一个单位在业务范围内把另一个单位包下来。如安徽医学院包干合巢公社医院，不仅进行业务上的指导以及技术力量、医疗设备上的支援，而且还负责医治公社医院无法医疗的疾病。省立医院派医疗水平较高的医务人员到肥东长临河公社医院工作，直接帮助这些医院能够独立处理一般手术。这种协作形式，目前除医院开展较普遍外，学校对工厂、公社办的学校也开始这样做。
    协作区，是同一地区同一专业的文教单位的协作。如文化协作区，教学协作区（辅导区），体育协作区等。到目前为止，市区中等以上学校共组织了三个学校协作区，参加的学校十五个，教师七百四十八人。市区文化协作区已建立十六个，参加的有工厂、机关、学校等一百三十九个单位，人数达一万零五千六百五十人。体育协作区共有九个，包括八十多个基层单位。协作区的单位之间，互相支援，互通有无，共同提高。教学协作区建立后，不仅对提高教学质量起很大作用，而且郊区中学供给市区中学生产园地，市区中学帮助郊区中学解决教学仪器不足的困难，有些教学仪器在本协作区内仍不能解决的，还在协作区与协作区之间，互通有无。
    通过大协作，文教事业数量的发展和质量的提高都大大加快了。国家办的医院和公社挂钩，帮助公社建立了不少医疗机构。学校由于建立了教学协作区，重点备课，公开教学，交流教学经验，提高了教师的业务水平，解决了教学中的困难。如中等学校第二协作区是由九所郊区学校组成的，大部分是新建学校，教师80％是新的，缺乏教学经验；协作区建立后，根据学科分别成立了七个教学研究组，在半年内举行教学活动四十七次，根据新老教师互相学习、互相帮助的精神，开展教学研究，迅速提高了新教师的业务水平。市庐剧团过去武功较差，经过省京剧团帮助练功之后，许多带武打的戏都能表演了。他们说：“如果没有京剧团的帮助，我们演出质量不会提高这样快。”京剧团的演员通过辅导别人，也提高了自己。
    大协作使党的文教方针得到了迅速贯彻，促进了文教工作更好地与生产结合，为生产服务。东市区民办职业中学与该区八个地方国营工厂挂钩后，除将部分学生留在学校工厂实习外，其余四百多名学生均分批分配到工厂车间学习，现在95％的学生基本上分别掌握了锻铆、铸工、金工、木工、模型、白铁、拉丝、刺绣等工种技术，有的已能翻砂车床零件，单独进行桌、椅等生产操作。通过文艺大协作，还推动了生产大协作。如车站区航空路文艺协作区建立后，有八个工厂的职工由于经常举行联欢，同台演出，彼此之间的关系密切了；春节期间，参加这个文艺协作区的康乐饴糖厂，任务吃紧而缺案板，木器厂就连夜为他们赶制，使他们生产超额完成了任务。
    大协作还加强了知识分子与工农群众的联系，推动了知识分子的思想改造。由于协作的开展，集体主义精神大大发扬。开始时，有的单位存在着“怕麻烦”、“怕吃亏”等个人主义和本位主义思想，通过协作，他们亲身体会到协作起到了取长补短，相互学习，相互帮助，相互促进的作用，从而出现了许多“先人后己，舍己为人”的生动事例。如合肥印刷厂派出三个技工到合肥三中印刷厂教授技术，已帮助五十名学生学会排字等技术，并把最好的圆盘机送给三中，帮助三中印刷厂解决设备不足困难，三中也抽调语文、历史教师到印刷厂担任职工业余学校教师，并利用规定的劳动时间，组织学生到合肥印刷厂帮助解决劳力不足问题。
