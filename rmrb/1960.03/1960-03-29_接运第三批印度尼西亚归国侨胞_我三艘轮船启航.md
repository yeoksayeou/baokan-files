Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, March 27th. The 956 returned overseas Chinese (including 305 returned overseas Chinese students) who returned to the motherland from Indonesia on the ships "Tjitarum" and "Tjiwani", arrived in Xiamen from Guangzhou on the 27th. They were warmly welcomed at the station by Shi Yao, Deputy Mayor of Xiamen and Deputy Director of the Xiamen Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, and representatives from all walks of life in Xiamen.

The returned overseas Chinese were very grateful for the cordial care of the motherland. Lu Yawang, an old miner who had worked in the Bangka tin mines for nearly 30 years, is over 60 years old and still single. This time, he brought back only a broken rattan box that he had used for more than 20 years and a bamboo basket, containing a blanket that he had used for 30 years, a torn mosquito net, a teapot, and four bowls. He said with emotion: "If it were not for the powerful motherland as our backing, I don't know when I would be able to return to the motherland." While many returned overseas Chinese recounted the unreasonable persecution they suffered from powerful groups in Indonesia, they also excitedly talked about the friendship between them and the Indonesian people. Yang Yaxiang, an electrician and auto mechanic who returned from a village near Sukabumi, had trained more than 200 Indonesian apprentices there, all of whom are now able to work independently. When he was forced to return to China, the apprentices came to his home day and night to see him off.

After staying in Xiamen for a day or two, this group of overseas Chinese, with the exception of the returned overseas Chinese students who will stay at the Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School for further study, will be settled at the state-owned Yongchun Beikeng Overseas Chinese Tea and Fruit Farm and the Jinjiang Shuangyang Overseas Chinese Farm to participate in production and construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, March 27th. The Chinese government's ship for picking up overseas Chinese, the "Yakutia", set sail from Zhanjiang Port on the morning of the 27th to pick up the third group of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia.

The "Yakutia" arrived at Zhanjiang Port at 8:00 a.m. on the 26th. Staff from relevant departments and stevedores loaded a large amount of supplies needed for picking up the overseas Chinese onto the ship in less than 24 hours, enabling the ship to set sail ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 28th. The Chinese government's ships for picking up overseas Chinese, the "Russia" and the "Fuan", set sail from Guangzhou and Zhanjiang today, respectively, for the third time to Indonesia.

    接运第三批印度尼西亚归国侨胞
    我三艘轮船启航
    新华社厦门27日电　从印度尼西亚乘“芝楂连加”、“芝万宜”号轮船回到祖国的九百五十六名侨胞（其中有三百零五名是归国华侨学生），27日由广州到达厦门。他们在车站上受到了厦门市副市长、厦门市接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任施耀和厦门市各界代表的热烈欢迎。
    归侨们对祖国的亲切关怀非常感激，在邦加锡矿工作近三十年的老矿工吕亚旺已经六十多岁，还是单身汉，他这次带回的行李只有一只用了二十多年的破藤箱和一个竹篮，里面装着一条盖了三十年的毯子、一顶破蚊帐和一个茶壶、四个碗，他感慨地说：“要不是有强大的祖国做靠山，我不知何时才能回到祖国”。不少归侨在叙述他们受到印度尼西亚有势力集团无理迫害的情况的同时，也兴奋地谈到了他们和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊。从苏加武眉附近一个村庄回国的电机、汽车修理工人杨亚祥在那里时培养了二百多个印度尼西亚学徒，这些学徒现在都已经能够独立工作。当他被迫回国时，学徒们不分昼夜地到他家里来送别。
    这批侨胞在厦门逗留一两天后，除归国华侨学生留在集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习外，其他侨胞将分别到国营永春北硿华侨茶果场和晋江双阳华侨农场安家落户，参加生产建设。
    新华社湛江27日电　中国政府接运华侨的船只——“亚库契亚”号，27日上午由湛江港口起航，开往印度尼西亚接运第三批归国华侨。
    “亚库契亚”号轮船于26日上午八时到达湛江港，有关部门工作人员和装卸工人不到二十四小时就把大批接侨所需的物资装运上船，使这条船能够提前起航。
    新华社广州28日电　中国政府派出接运华侨的轮船“俄罗斯”号和“福安”号，今天分别从广州和湛江起航，第三次开往印度尼西亚。
