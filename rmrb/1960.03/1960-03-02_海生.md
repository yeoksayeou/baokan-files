    A Chinese woman returning to China aboard the "Hai Huang" ship gave birth to a child at sea. This good news added joy to the people who came to Huangpu Port on the 29th to welcome the returned overseas Chinese.

    The course of events was as follows: Ten hours after the "Hai Huang" ship set sail from Indonesia—at just after three o'clock on the morning of February 24th—a woman named Yan Guilian suddenly felt abdominal pain, and it seemed she was about to give birth. She was a twenty-five-year-old young woman, and although her husband and two children were by her side, childbirth was not like other things, especially on a ship. She remembered her third son, who was born in Indonesia and died of illness because he was not well cared for. Who knew what would happen to this one!? She was a little worried, touching her belly and saying to her husband, Huang Meizhen, "Alas! How unlucky, that it has to be at this time."

    The ship's medical staff knew and carefully helped her to the delivery room. Doctor Yu Zhitii said to her with full confidence: "Don't worry, it's just like in a hospital here."

    This Doctor Yu and two nurses conducted a detailed examination of all pregnant women as soon as the returned overseas Chinese boarded the ship. These medical personnel were not accustomed to life at sea, especially Doctor Yu, who had never been to sea before and would get seasick and vomit at the slightest wind or wave. This brought some difficulties to the work. On the day Yan Guilian gave birth, there was a Force 7 gale, and the waves rose like mountain peaks, the ship swaying from side to side, and even those who didn't get seasick found it difficult to stand on the ship. Doctor Yu happened to vomit at this time. However, they were not deterred by the wind and waves, and the doctor and nurses supported each other, finally stood firm, and the work proceeded smoothly. After an hour, the child was finally born safely, emitting a "呱呱" cry. At this time, Yan Guilian smiled, Huang Meizhen smiled, and the doctors and nurses also smiled happily...

    Soon, the good news spread throughout the ship, and people congratulated Huang Meizhen and his wife. Some said that the child was born at a good time, and some said that you have been an overseas Chinese for generations, and this one can be considered born on the land of the motherland, because sitting on this ship means returning to the embrace of the motherland! In the five days after the child's birth, all the medicines and food needed by the mother and child were supplied by the ship, and nothing was lacking. The three medical personnel also took turns looking after them day and night.

    Huang Meizhen was very moved to see his wife being so meticulously cared for by the relatives of the motherland. He couldn't help but think of his family's three generations working in Indonesia, enduring hardship, and still being persecuted in the end, and so on. He was filled with emotion, feeling both happy and sad, and his eyes became moist. When the ship entered the territorial waters of the motherland, he specifically asked Doctor Yu to leave a mailing address so that he could send her a photo of the child in the future. He also wanted Doctor Yu to give his newborn son a name. Doctor Yu said, "The child was born at sea, how about calling him 'Haisheng'?" Huang Meizhen happily agreed.

    "Haisheng" returned to the motherland on the "Hai Huang" ship. As soon as the ship docked, medical personnel sent by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Medical College in Guangzhou took the mother and child to the hospital for hospitalization. When a nurse in white clothes held "Haisheng" and stepped on the land of the motherland, the people welcoming them on the shore immediately gathered around, and some enthusiastically shouted: "Welcome, new brother!" Someone asked Yan Guilian what her feelings were after returning to the motherland, she just repeated one sentence: "Thank you motherland! Thank you motherland!" Her husband, Huang Meizhen, added: "We will raise Haisheng well and bring him up to build the motherland in the future!"

    海生
    新华社记者　关振东
    乘“海皇”号轮船回国的一位华侨妇女，在海上生了一个小孩。这一喜讯，给29日到黄埔港欢迎归侨的人们增添了欢乐。
    事情的经过是这样的：在“海皇”号轮船从印度尼西亚启航后的十个小时——2月24日清晨三点多钟，船上一个名叫颜桂莲的妇女突然感到腹痛，看来是要分娩了。她是一个二十五岁的少妇，虽然丈夫和两个儿女都在身旁，可是生孩子不比别的，何况是在船上。她想起在印度尼西亚生的第三个儿子，就是因为料理不好，害病死掉了。谁知道这个又会怎样呢！？她有些担心，扪着肚子对丈夫黄美珍说：“唉！真不凑巧，偏偏在这个时候。”
    船上的医务人员知道后，细心地把她扶到产房里去。医生于至悌充满信心地对她说：“不用担心，这儿跟医院里一样。”
    这个于医生和两个护士，在归侨们刚上船时，就对所有孕妇进行了详细的检查。这些医务人员都不习惯海上生活，尤其是于医生从来没有出过海，一碰上风浪就要晕船呕吐。这给工作带来了一些困难。颜桂莲生小孩那天，正七级大风，海浪像一个个山峰一样涌起来，轮船左右摇摆，就是不晕船的人，也难在船上站得住脚。于医生偏在这时又呕吐起来。可是，她们没有被风浪难住，医生和护士三个人互相搀扶着，终于站稳了，工作顺利地进行着。经过了一个钟头，孩子终于平安地降生，发出了“呱呱”的哭声。这时，颜桂莲笑了，黄美珍笑了，医生和护士们也高兴地微笑了……
    不久，这一喜讯传遍了全船，人们纷纷向黄美珍夫妇道喜。有的说这孩子生得好时辰，有的说，你历代都是侨生，这个算是在祖国的土地上出世的了，因为坐上这轮船，就算回到祖国的怀抱里了！小孩出世以后的五天里，母子所需的药物、食品全部由船上供应，什么也不缺。三个医务人员还日夜轮流看护他们。
    黄美珍看见祖国的亲人这样无微不至地照顾着他的妻子，十分感动。不禁想起他家三代在印度尼西亚做工，受尽辛苦，到头来还是受到迫害等等往事，感触万千，心里一阵高兴，一阵难过，眼睛就潮湿了。当轮船进入祖国领海时，他特地要于医生留下一个通讯地址，以便将来替孩子照了相片寄给她。他还要于医生替他新生的儿子起个名字。于医生说：“孩子是在海上出世的，就叫‘海生’好吗？”黄美珍高兴地赞同了。
    “海生”乘着“海皇”号海轮回到了祖国。船一靠岸，广州市中山医学院附属医院派来的医务人员，就把他们母子俩接去住院。当穿着白色衣服的护士抱着“海生”踏上祖国的土地时，在岸上欢迎的人们马上围拢来，有人还热情地喊着：“欢迎你，新兄弟！”有人问颜桂莲回到祖国后有什么感想，她只是重复着一句话：“感谢祖国！感谢祖国！”她的丈夫黄美珍补充说：“我们要好好地把海生养育成人，将来建设祖国！”
