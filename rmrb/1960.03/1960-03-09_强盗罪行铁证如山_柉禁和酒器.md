Ironclad Evidence of Robbery
Fan-jin and Wine Vessels

    From the early 20th century, American imperialism began to plunder our country's ancient bronzes. A set of Fan-jin and wine vessels unearthed in Baoji, Shaanxi, is the most important and famous of these plundered items from this period. It is currently in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

    At the end of the Yin Dynasty and the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, the aristocracy was prone to excessive drinking, so the Duke of Zhou specially wrote a "Wine Announcement" to admonish the aristocracy of the Western Zhou, teaching them not to be as "wasteful and indulgent in wine" as the Yin people. Now we often find sets of drinking utensils in the tombs of the Yin and early Western Zhou dynasties. The wine vessels used by the aristocracy at that time were mostly cast in bronze (copper-tin alloy) and were sculpted very exquisitely. These wine vessels have different names because of their different uses.

    The set of wine vessels unearthed in Baoji dates from the early Western Zhou Dynasty and may not be from the same tomb. In the photograph, the rectangular piece at the bottom is called "Fan-jin," which is like a small kang table today. In the tomb, some wine vessels were placed on the jin, so there are still traces on the surface of the jin. The two rows of wine vessels on the jin, the one in the middle of the back row is called "zun," and the two next to it are called "you," both used for holding wine, like today's wine pots or wine bottles. The you have handles, making them easy to carry. In the front row from left to right, the first piece is called "jiao," the second is called "gu," the third is called "zhi," and the fourth is called "jue," all used for drinking wine, like today's wine glasses. The jiao and jue have three legs and can also be placed on the fire to warm the wine, and the gu can also be placed in hot water to warm the wine. The other pieces not on the jin, the three small ones on the left are zhi, the large one is called "he," and the one on the right is called "jia." The he and jia are used for holding wine and can also be used to warm wine.

    The jin and the set of wine vessels on it are decorated with exquisite taotie patterns, kui patterns, and bird patterns (taotie and kui are both mythical beasts imagined by the ancient people). These are rare works of art from the early Western Zhou Dynasty. Only two fan-jin have been found, making them even rarer cultural relics. These wine vessels not only illustrate the extravagance of the aristocracy at that time, but also reflect the high achievements of our ancient working people in bronze casting technology and工艺美术 (gongyi meishu - arts and crafts).

### 强盗罪行铁证如山  柉禁和酒器

    强盗罪行铁证如山
    柉禁和酒器
    二十世纪初叶，美帝国主义就开始掠夺我国的古代铜器了。陕西宝鸡出土的一套柉禁和酒器是这个时期的掠夺品中最重要和最著名的一宗。现在美国纽约市艺术博物馆。
    殷末周初，贵族酗酒成风，所以周公曾特地做一篇“酒诰”来训诫西周的贵族，教他们不要像殷人那样“荒腆于酒”。现在我们在殷代和西周早期的墓葬中，就常常发掘出成组的饮酒用具。当时贵族用的酒器，大多是青铜（铜锡合金）铸的，塑造十分精美。这些酒器，因为用途不同，也就有各种不同的名称。
    宝鸡出土的一套酒器是西周初年的，可能不是同一个墓中的器物。照片中，下面一件长方形的叫“柉（音凡）禁”，就是现在的小炕几。在墓内时，有些酒器是放在禁上的，所以现在禁面上还留有痕迹。禁上的两排酒器，后排中间的一件叫“尊”，旁边的两件叫“卣”（音酉），都是盛酒用的，像今天的酒壶或酒瓶。卣有提手，携带很方便。前排从左到右，第一件叫“角”，第二件叫“觚”（音孤），第三件叫“觯”（音支），第四件叫“爵”，都是饮酒用的，像今天的酒杯。角和爵有三条腿，还可以放在火上温酒，觚也可以放在热水中温酒。另外几件不在禁上的，左边三件小的是觯，大的叫“盉”（音禾），右边的一件叫“斝”（音贾）。盉和斝是盛酒用的，也可以温酒。
    禁和禁上的一套酒器都装饰着精致的饕餮（音滔铁）纹、夔纹和鸟纹，（饕餮和夔都是古时人们想像中的怪兽）。这些都是西周初期不可多得的艺术品。柉禁只发现过两件，更是罕见的文物。这些酒器既说明当时贵族的奢侈，也反映了我国古代劳动人民在青铜冶铸技术和工艺美术上的高度成就。　（寿晋）
