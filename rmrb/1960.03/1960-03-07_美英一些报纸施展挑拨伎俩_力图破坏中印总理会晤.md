Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: After Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru on February 26th was published, some newspapers in the United States and Britain became very fearful of the improvement of relations between China and India, two major Asian countries. They have employed various tricks to provoke discord between China and India, attempting to sabotage the Sino-Indian Prime Ministerial meeting.

The New York "Daily Mirror," in an editorial published on March 1st regarding Premier Zhou's reply, wantonly slandered China and provoked Sino-Indian relations. This American newspaper even advocated that India abandon its peaceful and neutral policy and seek imperialist "protection." It said that in the past, "it was Britain that defended India from Russian aggression. After Britain left, India has no power to defend its borders from Communist China's aggression." It believes that India "may pay a great price" for its peaceful neutrality.

The Washington "Evening Star," in its editorial on the same day, in addition to clamoring the hackneyed tune of "Chinese aggression," also attempted to discredit Premier Zhou's expression of a desire for friendly consultation with India in his reply, and did its utmost to exaggerate the differences between China and India.

The British "Guardian" published a report on February 29th, coinciding with the American newspapers in disparaging the wording of Premier Zhou's letter. This newspaper also repeated the slander that China had made "extensive territorial demands" on India.

The British "Birmingham Post" published an editorial on the same day, discrediting China's consistent position of peacefully resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute. It said that China's "methods of handling domestic and foreign affairs are not something that makes people feel optimistic." While Indian public opinion is calling for creating an atmosphere conducive to Sino-Indian negotiations, this British newspaper said with ulterior motives, "We must always be vigilant and not be deceived by expectations and hopes for a minute."

    美英一些报纸施展挑拨伎俩
    力图破坏中印总理会晤
    新华社6日讯　周恩来总理2月26日给尼赫鲁总理复信发表后，美国和英国的一些报纸十分害怕中印这两个亚洲大国间的关系得到改善，它们施展出各种伎俩挑拨中印关系，力图破坏中印总理的会晤。
    纽约“每日镜报”在3月1日就周总理的复信发表的社论中恣意诬蔑中国，挑拨中印关系。这家美国报纸居然鼓吹印度放弃和平中立政策，寻求帝国主义“保护”。它说，过去“保卫印度不受俄国侵略的是英国。英国走了以后印度没有任何力量来保卫边界不受共产党中国的侵略。”它认为，印度为和平中立主义“可能付出很大的代价”。
    华盛顿“明星晚报”在同一天的社调中，除了叫嚷“中国侵略”的滥调外，还力图诋毁周总理复信中对印度所表示的友好协商的愿望，并且竭力把中印之间的分歧加以夸大。
    英国的“卫报”2月29日刊登了一篇报道，同美国的报纸不约而同地诋毁周总理的信的措词。这家报纸也重复中国对印度提出了“大块领土要求”的诬蔑。
    英国“伯明翰邮报”同一天发表社论，诋毁中国一贯采取的和平解决中印边界争端的立场。它说，中国“处理内政外交的方法是没有什么使人感到乐观的。”当印度舆论呼吁创造有利于中印谈判的气氛的时候，这家英国报纸却别有用心地说，“必须经常保持警惕，一分钟也不能被期望和希望所欺骗。”
