Develop Workers' and Peasants' Education, Cultivate Technical Talents from Workers and Peasants

In 1958 and 1959, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, all undertakings throughout the country achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and workers' education also witnessed a sustained leap forward. By the end of 1958, approximately over ten million workers in industrial, capital construction, transportation, finance and trade systems across the country were participating in spare-time learning. By the end of 1959, this number had grown to seventeen million, an increase of over 50% compared to 1958. Many industrial and mining enterprises have initially established spare-time education systems and created many experiences. For example, the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, which this newspaper has reported on, cultivated advanced technical talents. The Shanghai textile factories persisted in year-round learning, spare-time schools of all levels and types blossomed everywhere in Taiyuan City, the Jilin Chemical Company achieved systemized education and networked research, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company cultivated apprentices, the Jiangling Machinery Factory in Sichuan implemented both factory-level and workshop-level schooling, and the spare-time education experiences of units such as the Harbin Coal and Sundries Store, the Hunan Xiangjiang Machinery Factory, and the Shandong Linqing Shipping Team were all relatively good examples. Today, this newspaper introduces Guangxi, Fushun Mining and Coal, Lanzhou Chemical Plant, and Kunming, which are only a few of them.

Promoting the Growth of the Proletarian Technical Contingent
Rapid Development of Workers' Spare-Time Education in Various Regions

Guangxi: Vigorously Running Workers' Spare-Time Education Cultivated a Large Number of Technical Personnel

This Dispatch: Guangxi's vigorous efforts in running workers' spare-time education have yielded fruitful results. 59% of the engineering and technical personnel in the industrial and transportation systems of the entire autonomous region were cultivated through workers' spare-time education.

The Party committees at all levels in Guangxi attach importance to cultivating technical talents and strengthening leadership over workers' spare-time education, adhering to the principle of walking on two legs: in addition to cultivating technical personnel from full-time and part-time schools, they also vigorously run workers' spare-time schools. According to recent incomplete statistics, enterprises in the industrial and transportation, agriculture and forestry, and finance and trade sectors have established more than 1,000 workers' spare-time schools of various levels and types, with over 350,000 workers enrolled.

After systematic spare-time education, the political thinking, technical level, and cultural outlook of the vast number of workers have undergone fundamental changes. The illiteracy and semi-illiteracy rate, which accounted for 70% to 80% of the workers in the early days of liberation, has been reduced to only about 15% by the end of last year. With the improvement of workers' cultural and technical levels, more than 3,800 technical talents have been cultivated from among them. The Nanning and Baise Regional Transportation Bureaus have opened technical schools to train drivers, adopting a method that combines education and productive labor. From 1958 to January this year, they have trained a total of 686 drivers. In addition to equipping the bureau with the necessary drivers, enabling the full implementation of two-shift day and night transportation, they have also allocated a portion to counties, communes, agencies, and factories and mines to undertake long-distance transportation tasks in mountainous areas.

Many workers have improved their cultural and technical levels through learning, and have more fully played a exemplary, leading, and backbone role in production.

The Party committees at all levels implement grasping production with one hand and grasping education with the other, and strengthen leadership over workers' spare-time education based on the principles of "combining with production, unified arrangement, teaching according to aptitude, and flexibility and diversity." In solving the problem of teachers, various localities have adopted a variety of methods to cultivate a large number of spare-time teachers, ensuring the smooth development of spare-time education.

Fushun Coal Mine

Miners Engage in Large-Scale Spare-Time Cultural Learning After Eliminating Illiteracy

This Dispatch: After basically shaking off illiteracy, the miners of Fushun Coal Mine are further speeding up and engaging in large-scale spare-time cultural learning.

The Fushun Coal Mine, where the illiteracy rate was originally as high as over 85%, has now basically eliminated illiteracy among its miners. As of mid-January, 96% of young and middle-aged miners recognize 1,500 characters and can read, write, and use them. The remainder have also basically completed literacy courses. At the same time, 99.1% of the newly literate workers have entered spare-time primary schools. The coal mine has established more than 190 schools of various levels and types, including 13 universities, enabling the vast number of workers to quickly climb the peak of science and culture.

In eliminating illiteracy, the Fushun Coal Mine, based on the production characteristics of the mine, primarily relies on classes, while also flexibly using various methods to widely organize workers to participate in spare-time learning. In order to take care of the rest of night shift workers, classes are held before work. In order to solve the learning problems of workers with high mobility and those working underground, they have set up tutoring stations in all corners of the mine, so that some workers who cannot attend classes due to shift work and the need to go down the mine early can receive timely tutoring after work. For a small number of workers engaged in mobile production, organized teaching and learning are implemented. For a small number of workers living far from the mine and scattered mobile production workers, self-study groups are organized. The method of using small blackboards to enter mine pits and mine shafts is also adopted to deliver culture to the doorstep. Through these methods, workers working on the surface, underground shift workers, and scattered workers can learn at any time.

In order to enable miners to learn quickly, remember firmly, and learn enthusiastically, in addition to compiling literacy textbooks based on the characteristics of coal mines, teachers also vigorously improve teaching methods and increase teaching efficiency. They also vigorously promote the "radical character recognition method" based on the strong understanding ability of miners, so that miners can "infer three things from one instance" after learning one character. In addition, many mining areas and factories widely use the "everything speaks" literacy method, writing the names of various objects on them, so that miners can learn wherever they go, and learn whatever they see. After this coal mine vigorously promoted this set of experience, the speed of literacy was greatly accelerated. The total number of people who eliminated illiteracy last year was equal to the total of the past eight years.

Lanzhou Chemical Plant

Established a "One-Stop" Education System

This Dispatch: The Lanzhou Chemical Plant vigorously runs workers' schools, establishing a one-stop education system from literacy, primary school, middle school to university, rapidly improving the cultural and technical level of workers, and becoming a model for factory and mine-run schools in Lanzhou City.

The Lanzhou Chemical Plant's spare-time education is composed of 46 Red and Expert Schools, one secondary vocational school, one night university, and one half-work, half-study chemical engineering college. There are a total of eight literacy classes, 105 higher primary classes, 86 junior middle school classes, 16 senior middle school classes, and 10 university classes.

When the Lanzhou Chemical Plant started running schools in 1956, it did not implement the "one-stop" system. There were only literacy, higher primary, junior middle, and night university, but no senior middle school classes. As a result, workers who graduated from junior middle school could not continue their studies, and the source of students for the night university also became a problem. It was also difficult for workers transferred from other factories to join classes midway.

In 1958, the factory's Party committee decided to equip workers' spare-time education with complete sets of small, medium, and large schools, connecting them end to end to form a "dragon." Therefore, 16 senior middle school classes and one chemical engineering college (four university classes) were added to the factory. In this way, every worker can start from literacy without leaving production and continue studying uninterruptedly until graduation from university. This creates learning conditions for both veteran workers and provides convenience for workers transferred from other factories to join classes midway. All of the workers who entered the factory before October 1959, as well as cooks and childcare workers who were illiterate, have now become literate. Workers with a cultural level below lower primary, accounting for 31% of the total number of factory workers, have reached the higher primary level. Workers with a higher primary level, accounting for 30% of the total number of workers, have improved to the junior middle school level. The number of workers with a junior middle school level in the entire factory has more than doubled compared to before. The proportion of workers with a senior middle school level was originally only 8.5% of the total number of factory workers, and has now reached 14.7%. 267 workers are studying at the Chemical Engineering College and Night University.

In the process of running "one-stop" education, the Lanzhou Chemical Plant mainly adopts three grasps in leadership (grasping the implementation of the Party's education policy, grasping teaching quality, grasping the ideological work of teachers and students), and unified arrangement of study time. Various relatively complete learning systems have been formulated, and evaluations and inspections are frequently carried out. At the same time, learning is closely integrated with production, so that the cultural revolution and the technical revolution complement each other. In the past year, workers have put forward more than 10,000 rationalization proposals, and a large number of inventions, creations, and technological innovations have emerged. (Sun Jing)

Kunming Factories and Mines Vigorously Promote Collaboration in Running Workers' Spare-Time Education

This Dispatch: In vigorously running workers' spare-time education, Kunming's factories and mines adopt the method of large factories helping small factories, advanced factories helping backward factories, conducting activities in groups, and vigorously promoting collaboration, which has promoted the rapid development of workers' spare-time education.

Since vigorously running workers' spare-time education, many large factories in Kunming City, due to the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy by the Party Committee, have grasped production with one hand and education with the other, established spare-time education organizations, equipped teachers, and properly arranged study time. Therefore, the workers' spare-time education work in these factories has been very successful. The number of workers enrolled generally accounts for about 90% of the total number of workers, and the attendance rate is also very high. Through learning, the current production has been powerfully promoted. However, the workers' spare-time education work in many small factories cannot be carried out very well, and some even cannot start classes for a long time due to a lack of teachers.

In order to enable every factory to better carry out workers' spare-time education work, so that they can both produce products and produce talents, many large factories in Kunming City have promoted the communist style, vigorously promoted collaboration, divided into fifteen groups by region, and actively helped small factories solve various specific difficulties in workers' spare-time education work. Their main methods of vigorously promoting collaboration are: 1. Large factories hold part-time teacher spare-time training classes, and while training teachers in their own factories, accept part-time teachers from various small factories in the group to participate in learning, in order to solve the problem of insufficient teachers in small factories. 2. Large factories send excellent teachers with rich teaching experience to small factories to give demonstration lectures, or study and prepare lessons together with small factory teachers, which also improves the teaching level of small factory teachers. 3. Large factories donate teaching materials to small factories or help small factories compile teaching materials, so that the problems of insufficient manpower and lack of teaching materials in small factories can be solved. 4. Factories in the group gather together twice a month, convened by the large factory in charge, to report on learning progress, exchange teaching experiences, and solve problems existing in the work of small factories that large factories can handle in a timely manner.

    发展工农业作教育  培养工农技术人材
    1958年和1959年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全国各方面的事业全面大跃进，职工教育工作也出现了持续跃进的局面。1958年底，全国工业、基本建设、交通运输、财政贸易等系统的职工，参加业余学习的约为一千多万人，到1959年底已经发展到一千七百万人，1959年比1958年增加了50％以上。许多工矿企业初步建立了业余教育的体系，创造了很多经验。如本报曾经报道过的北京电子管厂培养高级技术人材，上海各纺织厂坚持常年学习，太原市各级各类业余学校遍地开花，吉林化学公司教育成系、研究成网，武汉钢铁公司培养徒工，四川江陵机器厂厂部办学和车间办学并举，以及哈尔滨煤炭一商店、湖南湘江机器厂、山东临清船队等单位的业余教育的经验，都是一些比较好的典型。今天本报介绍的广西、抚顺矿煤、兰州化工厂、昆明，只是其中的几个。
    促进无产阶级技术大军的成长
    各地职工业余教育迅速发展
    广西  大办职工业余教育培养了大批技术人员
    本报讯　广西大办职工业余教育开花结果。全自治区工业交通系统中的工程技术人员，有59％是通过职工业余教育培养出来的。
    广西各级党委重视培养技术人材和加强对职工业余教育的领导，坚持两条腿走路的方针：除从全日制和半日制的学校培养技术人员外，同时大办职工业余学校。据最近的不完全统计，工交、农林、财贸三方面的企业已建立了各级各类职工业余学校一千多所，职工入学人数达三十五万多人。
    广大职工经过系统的业余教育，政治思想、技术水平、文化面貌已发生了根本变化。解放初期占职工人数70％到80％的文盲和半文盲，到去年底降低到只占15％左右；随着工人文化和技术水平的提高，从中培养出了三千八百多名技术人材。南宁和百色专区的交通运输局，开办了培训驾驶员的技术学校，采取教育和生产劳动相结合的办法，从1958年到今年1月份共培训出六百八十六名驾驶员，除配齐局里所需要的驾驶员，得以全面实行双班日夜运输外，还抽出一部分配到县、公社、机关和厂矿担负山区长途运输的任务。
    许多工人经过学习提高了文化和技术水平，在生产中更充分地发挥了模范、带头、骨干作用。
    各级党委实行一手抓生产，一手抓教育，并根据“结合生产，统一安排，因材施教，灵活多样”的原则，加强对职工业余教育的领导，在解决师资问题上，各地采取了多种多样的办法，培养出大批业余师资，保证了业余教育顺利的开展。　（龚成华）
    抚顺煤矿
    矿工脱盲后大搞业余文化学习
    本报讯　抚顺煤矿的矿工基本上摆脱文盲状态后，正进一步快马加鞭大搞业余文化学习。
    原来文盲高达85％以上的抚顺煤矿，现在已经基本扫除了矿工文盲。到1月中旬为止，青壮年矿工中，96％的人认得一千五百个字，并能读、能写、能用，其余的人也基本学完了扫盲课程。同时并有99．1％的脱盲职工进入了业余初级小学。煤矿已办起一百九十多所各级各类学校，其中大学有十三所，使广大职工能够迅速地攀登科学文化高峰。
    抚顺煤矿扫除文盲工作中，根据矿山的生产特点，以上课为主，同时灵活运用各种办法，广泛组织工人参加业余学习。为了照顾夜班工人休息，就在上班前上课。为了解决流动性大的工人和井下作业工人的学习问题，他们在矿山各角落遍设补课站，使有些因为倒班和需要提前下井不能上课的工人，下班后能够及时补课；对少数流动生产的工人，组织包教保学；对住家离矿远的少数工人和分散流动生产工人组织自学小组。还采用小黑板下矿坑、矿井的办法，送文化上门。通过这些办法，使井上、井下倒班工人和分散作业工人随时都能学习。
    为了使矿工学得快、记得牢、学得起劲，教师除了根据煤矿特点自编扫盲教材外，并大力改进教学方法，提高教学效率。他们还根据矿工的理解能力强的特点，大力推行“偏旁识字法”，使矿工学了一个字能够“举一返三”。此外，许多矿区、工厂普遍采用“万物说话”的扫盲方法，在各种物件上写上它的名称，让矿工走到哪里学到那里，见到什么就学什么。这个煤矿大力推行这套经验后，大大加快了扫盲速度。去年一年扫除文盲总数，等于过去八年的总和。
    兰州化工厂
    建立“一条龙”教育体系
    本报讯　兰州化工厂大办职工学校，建立了从扫盲、小学、中学到大学的一条龙教育体系，迅速提高了职工的文化技术水平，成为兰州市厂矿办学的标兵。
    兰州化工厂业余教育，是由四十六所红专学校、一所中等专业学校、一所夜大学、一所半工半读的化工学院组成的。共有扫盲班八个、高小班一百零五个、初中班八十六个、高中班十六个、大学班十个。
    兰州化工厂1956年开始办学时没搞“一条龙”，只有扫盲、高小、初中和夜大学，没有高中班。结果，初中毕业的职工不能继续学习，而夜大学的学生来源也成问题，外厂转来的职工插班也有困难。
    1958年工厂党委决定要使职工的业余教育小中大配成套，首尾相连成“龙”，于是在厂里增设了高中班十六个、化工学院一所（大学四个班）。这样，使每一个工人不脱离生产，就可以从扫盲开始不间断地一气读到大学毕业。既给老职工创造学习条件，也给外厂转进来的职工中途插班以方便。1959年10月以前进厂的工人以及炊事员、保育员中的文盲已经全部脱盲；占全厂职工总数31％的初小文化程度以下的工人，已达到高小水平；占职工总数30％的高小工人已经提高到初中程度。全厂初中程度的职工比原来增加了一倍多；高中程度的原来仅占全厂职工总数的8．5％，现已达到14．7％。有二百六十七名职工在化工学院和夜大学学习。
    兰州化工厂在办“一条龙”教育过程中，领导上主要采取三抓（抓党的教育方针贯彻执行，抓教学质量，抓教员与学员的思想工作），统一安排学习时间。制订了各种比较完整的学习制度，经常进行评比检查。同时，使学习紧密结合生产，使文化革命与技术革命相辅相成。去年一年中，职工提出了一万多件合理化建议，出现了大量的发明创造与技术革新。　（孙晶）
    昆明厂矿办职工业余教育中大搞协作
    本报讯　昆明各厂矿企业在大办职工业余教育中采用大厂帮小厂，先进帮落后，分片活动，大搞协作的办法，促进了职工业余教育的迅速发展。
    大办职工业余教育以来，昆明市许多大型工厂由于党委贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，作到一手抓生产，一手抓教育，建立了业余教育的组织机构，配备了教师，妥善地安排了学习时间。因此，这些厂的职工业余教育工作很有成绩，入学职工一般都占职工总人数的90％左右，出勤率也很高。通过学习，有力地推动了当前生产。但是不少小厂的职工业余教育工作却不能很好开展起来，有的甚至因缺乏师资长期不能开课。
    为了使每个工厂都能把职工业余教育工作更好地开展起来，作到既出产品又出人材，昆明市许多大厂都发扬了共产主义风格，大搞协作，按地区分成十五个片，分片活动，积极帮助小厂解决业余教育工作中的各种具体困难。他们大搞协作的方法主要是：一、大厂举办兼职教师业余训练班，在培训本厂教师的同时，接受片内各小厂的兼职教师参加学习，以便解决小厂教师不足的困难。二、大厂抽出教学经验丰富的优秀教师到小厂作示范讲课，或是和小厂教师一起研究备课，这也提高了小厂教师的教学水平。三、大厂赠送教材给小厂或是帮助小厂编写教材，使小厂人力不足和缺乏教材的问题得到解决。四、片内各厂每月在一起集会二次，由大厂负责召开，会上互相汇报学习情况，交流教学经验，小厂工作上存在的问题，凡是大厂能办到的都及时地帮助解决。　（沈清泉）（附图片）
