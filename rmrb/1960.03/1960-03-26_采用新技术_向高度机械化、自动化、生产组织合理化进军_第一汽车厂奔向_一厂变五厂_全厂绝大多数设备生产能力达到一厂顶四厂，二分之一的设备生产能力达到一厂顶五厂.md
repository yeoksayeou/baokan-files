    Adopting New Technologies, Advancing Towards High Mechanization, Automation, and Rationalization of Production Organization
    The First Automobile Works Strives for "One Factory Becoming Five"
    The production capacity of the vast majority of equipment in the factory reaches the equivalent of one factory becoming four, and the production capacity of one-half of the equipment reaches the equivalent of one factory becoming five.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 25th: In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the First Automobile Works mobilized all employees to vigorously promote "One New and Three Transformations," scaling the heights of automotive industrial technology. Over the past two months, they have comprehensively improved the enterprise's production and technical level, taking another big step towards the grand goal of "One Factory Becoming Five."
    The goal of "One Factory Becoming Five" was proposed by the factory during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The specific content of this goal is to increase the original design capacity of 50 vehicles per shift to 250 vehicles per shift. After the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, and especially the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution launched this time on a factory-wide scale, with the main content being the adoption of new technologies and advancing towards high mechanization, automation, and rationalization of production organization (referred to as "One New and Three Transformations"), the vast majority of the factory's equipment has now reached a production capacity of 200 vehicles per shift, and nearly one-half of the equipment has reached a production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift.
    The "One New and Three Transformations" movement is a movement to comprehensively change the technical face of the enterprise. This is a new development and a new stage in the technical innovation movement of the First Automobile Works. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, after the tempering of the Great Leap Forward since 1958 and communist education, the political consciousness of the factory's employees has become increasingly high, and the demand for building socialism at high speed has become increasingly strong, and they are increasingly dissatisfied with small changes and small innovations. Therefore, as soon as the "One New and Three Transformations" movement was launched throughout the factory, its momentum was extraordinary. It was not only fierce but also involved a wide range, with a large scale and great impact, causing profound changes in many aspects of work. The factory's employees are full of energy and have amazing boldness. As the factory's workers said, "The more we work, the more we dare to think, the more we think, the more we dare to do; the more we think, the higher we aim, the more we do, the bigger we make it." Bold and ambitious slogans representing the will and spirit of the workers have appeared in every workshop. Workers in the engine workshop said, "Moving mountains like the Foolish Old Man is too slow, we must learn from Erlang and carry the mountains!" Foundry workers proposed, "In the past, we squatted to work, now we stand to work, and in the future, we will sit to work." Assembly workers proposed, "No need to lift large parts by hand, small parts move automatically." Chassis workers even wrote a poem saying, "I am a worker, the worker is the master, what the master says counts, if I tell you (referring to the machine tool) to be automatic, you wouldn't dare disobey!"
    Because this movement has "One New and Three Transformations" as the direction, "250 vehicles per shift" as the goal, and a year-long plan as guidance, with plans at every level, it has driven work in all aspects and achieved immediate results. In less than two months, the number of automated production lines in the factory has increased from the original one to 192. The rate of automated and semi-automated equipment has increased from the original 27% to 43.5%. On the assembly line, the degree of mechanization has increased from 70% to over 80%. More than 580 people in the factory have been freed from manual and heavy physical labor. Manual operations such as warehouse transportation, casting cleaning, parts loading and unloading, and inspection have been quickly armed with various machines. In order to adapt to the needs of reforming processes and highly automating production, many workshops and groups throughout the factory have readjusted production equipment according to new floor plans, making the production layout and work arrangements more reasonable and the connection between processes more compact. More than 8,300 various new technologies have been adopted and promoted throughout the factory. For example, in casting and forging, there are automatic and silent molding, precision casting, flashless extrusion forging, gear rounding machines, program control, ultrasonic drilling, conductive grinding, electrostatic spraying, and radio-controlled crane operation. The adoption of these new technologies has not only increased labor efficiency many times over but also fundamentally changed the operating environment for workers. The emergence of these innovative achievements has saved the factory 5,629 square meters of production area, more than 200 pieces of equipment, and more than 1,000 workers, effectively promoting the early completion of production tasks. The average daily output of cars in the factory has now exceeded two and a half times that of the same period last year.
    The great achievements of the First Automobile Works in vigorously promoting "One New and Three Transformations" eloquently answer the question of whether modern enterprises need to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, as well as what kind of revolution to carry out and how to carry it out. In the past, some people in the factory believed that "modern factories cannot be changed" or "only small changes can be made, not big changes." Now, this erroneous view has been shattered by facts. Indeed, the equipment of the First Automobile Works is modern, with a degree of mechanization of over 70% on the assembly line, and automated and semi-automated machine tools account for 27.6%. However, it is still not a fully mechanized and highly automated factory, and there are still more than 30% of manual operations and heavy auxiliary labor in production. At the same time, there is no end to technical innovation, and with the continuous development of industry, many new technologies and cutting-edge technologies related to the automotive industry must also be widely adopted. In the "One New and Three Transformations" movement, the revolutionary measures of replacing manual labor with mechanized operation, transforming from mechanized and semi-mechanized to highly mechanized, automated, and automatic production lines, and using program control to retrofit universal equipment have all increased production capacity correspondingly by multiples or even dozens of times. Wang Fucheng, the creator of the factory's first locally-made automated production line, after realizing the automation of the drilling machine process, connected four machine tools together to form an automated production line, increasing production efficiency from 110 vehicles per shift to 310 vehicles per shift, reducing the original four operators to one. The brake drum production line in the rear axle workshop of the chassis workshop only adjusted the equipment and installed mechanical arms, and the production capacity immediately jumped from 90 vehicles per shift to 200 vehicles per shift. The 3,500-ton press used to press automobile beams used to be the heaviest labor for loading and unloading parts in the entire factory, with a dozen workers manually feeding and removing the blanks every day; now, using the automatic feeding table created by the workers themselves, only two people standing next to the equipment and operating the button can easily and happily complete the task. These achievements fully demonstrate the great significance of the "One New and Three Transformations" movement in changing the face of the enterprise and rapidly improving the level of production technology, thereby further enhancing the confidence of the factory's employees in carrying out the technical revolution. Now, the factory's technical innovation movement is continuing to advance rapidly. (Attached picture)
    Changchun First Automobile Works, the journal bearing group of the engine workshop successfully designed an automatic production line for journal bearings connected by two presses from blanking to forming, increasing the shift output to 1,280 vehicles, increasing work efficiency by more than seven times compared with the past, and saving two manpower and one press.

    采用新技术　向高度机械化、自动化、生产组织合理化进军
    第一汽车厂奔向“一厂变五厂”
    全厂绝大多数设备生产能力达到一厂顶四厂，二分之一的设备生产能力达到一厂顶五厂
    新华社长春25日电　第一汽车制造厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，发动全厂职工大搞“一新三化”，攀登汽车工业技术高峰，近两个月来全面提高了企业的生产和技术水平，使全厂向“一厂变五厂”的宏伟目标又迈进了一大步。
    “一厂变五厂”这一目标，是这个工厂在1958年大跃进中提出的。这一目标的具体内容就是要把班产汽车五十辆份的原设计能力，提高到班产二百五十辆份。经过1959年的继续大跃进，特别是这次开展的全厂规模的以采用新技术、向高度机械化、自动化、生产组织合理化（简称“一新三化”）进军为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，现在全厂的绝大多数设备都已达到了班产二百辆份的生产能力，有近二分之一的设备生产能力已经达到班产二百五十辆份。
    “一新三化”运动是全面改变企业技术面貌的运动。这是第一汽车制造厂技术革新运动的新发展、新阶段。在总路线的光辉照耀下，经过1958年以来大跃进的锻炼和共产主义教育，这个工厂职工的政治觉悟越来越高，高速度建设社会主义的要求日益强烈，越来越不满足于小改小革。因此，“一新三化”运动在全厂一展开，气势就异常磅礴，不但来势猛烈，而且涉及范围广，声势大，影响大，使许多工作发生了深刻的变化。全厂职工干劲十足，气魄惊人，正如这个厂的工人所说的“越干越敢想，越想越敢干；越想越敢想，越干越敢干；越想越高，越干越大。”各个车间都出现了代表工人意志和气魄的豪言壮语。发动机车间工人说：“愚公移山嫌太慢，要学二郎把山担！”铸工造型工人提出：“过去蹲着干，现在站着干，将来要坐着干。”装配工人提出：“大件不用手，小件自动走。”底盘工人更写诗说：“我是工人，工人是主人，主人说话就算，要你（指机床）自动，你敢不答应！”
    这次运动由于有“一新三化”作方向，有“班产二百五十”辆份作目标，又有全年的规划作指导，层层都有规划，因此带动了各方面的工作，收到立竿见影的效果。全厂在不到两个月的时间，自动化生产线就由原来的一条增加到一百九十二条；自动化和半自动化设备上升率，从原有27％提高到43．5％；在流水生产线上，机械化程度已由70％提高到80％以上。全厂有五百八十多人摆脱了手工和笨重体力劳动。厂内仓库运输、铸件清理、零件装卸、检查等手工操作工序，已经迅速地被各种机械武装起来。为了适应改革工艺和生产高度自动化的需要，全厂有不少工部和小组，都已按照新的平面布置，重新调整了生产设备，使生产平面布置和工作安排得更加合理，工序之间的衔接更加紧密。全厂采用和推广的各种新技术已达八千三百多项。例如在铸、锻方面的自动无声造型、精密铸造、无飞边挤压锻造、齿轮圆拉机、程序控制、超声波钻孔、导电磨削、静电喷漆，以及用无线电控制天车运行等。这些新技术的采用，不但使劳动效率成倍上升，而且也从根本上改变了工人的操作环境。这些革新成就的出现，已使全厂节省出五千六百二十九平方米生产面积、二百多台设备和一千多名工人，有效地推动了生产任务的提前完成。现在全厂汽车的平均日产量，已经超过了去年同期的两倍半。
    第一汽车制造厂大搞“一新三化”的巨大成就，雄辩地解答了现代化企业是否需要进行技术革新和技术革命，以及革什么命和如何革法的问题。过去厂里曾有一些人认为“现代化大厂不能改动”，或“只能小改不能大改”；现在，这种错误观点已被事实冲破了。的确，第一汽车制造厂的设备是现代化的，在流水生产线上，机械化程度达到70％以上，自动和半自动化机床占27．6％。但是，它仍然不是全盘机械化和高度自动化的工厂，在生产中还有30％以上的手工操作和笨重辅助劳动。同时，技术革新是永远没有止境的，随着工业的不断发展，许多同汽车工业有关的新技术和尖端技术，也必须广泛采用。在“一新三化”运动中出现的以机械化操作代替手工劳动，从机械化半机械化转变为高度机械化、自动化、自动生产线，用程序控制改装万能设备等革命措施，都使生产能力相应地有了成倍的甚至几十倍的增长。全厂第一条土洋结合自动生产线的创造者王福成，在实现钻床工序自动化之后，又把四台机床连接起来变成自动化生产线，使生产效率由班产一百一十辆份提高到三百一十辆份，把原来四人操作减为一人。底盘车间后桥工部刹车鼓生产线，只将设备作了调整，安装了机械手，生产能力便立即由班产九十辆份跃进到二百辆份。压制汽车大梁用的三千五百吨大压床，过去上下料是全厂零件装卸最重的劳动，每天要十几个工人用手把毛坯送进送出；现在使用上工人自己创造的自动送料台，只要两个人站在设备旁边操纵电钮，就能轻松愉快地完成任务。这些成就充分说明“一新三化”运动对于改变企业面貌、迅速提高生产技术水平的重大意义，因此进一步增强了全厂职工进行技术革命的信心。现在，这个厂的技术革新运动正在继续向前猛进。（附图片）
