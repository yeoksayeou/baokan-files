Jiangsu Plain Builds Large Quantities of Timber Forests

Their experiences are: putting politics in command and launching mass movements; correctly handling the contradiction between grain, cash crops, and land for afforestation; taking seedlings as the center, grasping development on one hand and high yield on the other; combining short-term and long-term benefits, using the short-term to support the long-term; and combining large, medium, and small-scale afforestation, implementing local production and local supply.

(Dispatch from our newspaper) Jiangsu Province, in the greening and afforestation movement of last winter and this spring, vigorously developed timber forests, creating good experiences for solving the problem of timber self-sufficiency in plain areas quickly, well, and economically.

Jiangsu Province is basically a plain area with a very poor historical foundation in forestry production, and most of the timber needed relies on supply from other provinces.

In order to quickly and fundamentally solve the problem of timber self-sufficiency, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed a long-term plan for developing forestry specialties as early as 1958, requiring the province's timber forest area to reach eight million mu by 1962. This plan greatly encouraged the people of the province, who, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels, set high goals and lofty ambitions, held high the red flag of the General Line, gave full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and vigorously developed timber forests, achieving great results. In the last winter and this spring alone, the province built 1.63 million mu of timber forests, accounting for 40% of the total area of timber forests built in the past ten years. Now the total area of timber forests in the province has reached 5.9 million mu. These timber forests, if harvested ten to fifteen years after planting, can be harvested from 400,000 to 600,000 mu each year. Calculated at an average of ten cubic meters of wood produced per mu (including some sparsely planted areas in the past), 4 to 6 million cubic meters of wood can be produced each year, which is more than three times the province's current annual timber consumption. With the addition of bamboo, shrubs, fiberboard, and other substitute wood materials, it is possible to basically achieve timber self-sufficiency in about ten years. If the Provincial Party Committee's plan can be realized as scheduled, Jiangsu Province's timber self-sufficiency problem can be fundamentally solved.

In vigorously developing timber forests, Jiangsu has implemented the policy of taking grain as the key, making overall arrangements, and developing diversified operations, rationally arranging the layout of grain, cash crops, and forestry, and correctly handling the issue of competition for land between developing timber forests and developing grain production and cash crops. Although Jiangsu Province has an average of only about two mu of arable land per agricultural population, it still has more than 14 million mu of barren mountains, wastelands, and beaches suitable for afforestation, with great potential. Therefore, various localities regard barren mountains, wastelands, and beaches as the main battlefields for developing timber forests. In this way, not only is the area of arable land guaranteed not to shrink, but also the area of arable land is expanded due to land reclamation and afforestation and the implementation of agroforestry intercropping, which promotes the development of grain and cash crops.

In order to develop timber forests at high speed, various localities have conscientiously implemented the forestry production policy of "taking seedlings as the center, grasping development on one hand and high yield on the other" put forward by the Provincial Party Committee, vigorously grasping seedlings and development, and strengthening the tending and management of forest gardens to promote the rapid growth of trees.

How to develop timber forest farms and people's communes, reduce afforestation investment, and solve the economic benefits before trees mature is an important issue in developing timber forests at high speed and on a large scale. In addition to implementing the principle of self-collection and self-cultivation to solve seedlings, greatly reducing national and commune investment, various localities have universally promoted the method of "combining short-term and long-term benefits, using the short-term to support the long-term" throughout the province. In developing timber forests, various localities have vigorously engaged in diversified operations, combining diversified operations with income in the current year with timber forest production with income only in many years, and using the "short" of diversified operations to support the "long" of timber forests. According to incomplete statistics, of the province's more than 1,700 state-owned and commune- and team-run forestry specialty farms and nurseries, more than two-thirds have achieved self-sufficiency in grain, funds, fertilizers, and feed within one or two years due to the adoption of the method of "combining short-term and long-term benefits, using the short-term to support the long-term."

In terms of the scale of timber forest construction, various localities, based on the needs of national construction and people's lives and the specific conditions of their regions, and in accordance with the principle of local production and local supply, have implemented a combination of large, medium, and small-scale, with large-scale as the main focus. Various localities have used barren mountains, wastelands, and beaches to build large-scale bases with areas of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mu. While building large-scale timber forest bases, various localities have also made full use of "four sides" scattered land to engage in medium and small-scale timber forests to solve the needs of communes for timber and people's lives for timber. At present, various localities are seizing the great opportunity before spring sowing to carry out a greening "three wastelands" shock movement centered on the construction of timber forests.

### 江苏平原大量营造用材林

    江苏平原大量营造用材林
    他们取得的经验是：政治挂帅，大搞群众运动；正确处理粮食、经济作物和造林用地的矛盾；以种苗为中心，一手抓发展，一手抓丰产；长短结合，以短养长；造林规模大中小相结合，实行就地生产，就地供应。
    本报讯　江苏省在去冬今春绿化造林运动中，大力发展用材林，为平原地区多快好省地解决木材自给创造了很好的经验。
    江苏省基本上是个平原地区，历史上林业生产基础很差，所需木材绝大部分依靠外省供应。
    为了迅速地从根本上解决木材自给的问题，中共江苏省委早在1958年就提出了发展林业特产的远景规划，要求到1962年全省用材林面积达到八百万亩。这个规划大大鼓舞了全省人民，他们在省委和各级党委的领导下，树雄心、立大志，高举总路线红旗，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，大力发展用材林，取得了很大成绩。仅去冬今春全省就营造了用材林一百六十三万亩，占十年来营造用材林总面积的40％。现在全省用材林总面积已达五百九十万亩。这些用材林按栽后十年到十五年成材，每年能采伐四十万到六十万亩，平均每亩（包括以往一部分稀植的在内）以生产木材十个立方米计算，每年就可生产木材四百万到六百万立方米，比全省现在全年木材消费量还增加三倍左右。加上竹子、灌木、纤维板等代用木料，这样，在十年左右的时间内，有可能基本上达到用材自给。如果能够如期实现省委规划的话，江苏省的木材自给问题就可以根本解决。
    江苏各地在大力发展用材林中，贯彻了以粮为纲，全面安排，发展多种经营的方针，合理安排了粮食、经济作物和林业的布局，正确处理了发展用材林与发展粮食生产、经济作物争地的问题。江苏省虽然平均每个农业人口仅有二亩左右耕地，但还有一千四百多万亩宜于植林的荒山、荒地、荒滩，潜力很大。于是，各地就把荒山、荒地、荒滩、作为发展用材林的主要阵地。这样，不仅保证了不缩小耕地面积，而且由于开荒造林，实行林农间作，还扩大了耕地面积，促进了粮食和经济作物的发展。
    为了高速度地发展用材林，各地认真贯彻执行了省委提出的“以种苗为中心，一手抓发展，一手抓丰产”的林业生产方针，大抓种苗、大抓发展，加强了林园的抚育管理，促使林木迅速成材。
    怎样发展用材林的林场和人民公社，减少造林投资，和解决林木成材以前的经济收益，是高速度、大规模地发展用材林的一个重要问题。各地除了贯彻自采自育的原则解决种苗，大大减少国家和公社投资以外，在全省范围内普遍推广了“长短结合、以短养长”的方法。各地在发展用材林中，大搞多种经营，使当年就有收益的多种经营与多年才有收益的用材林生产结合起来，以多种经营之“短”，养用材林之“长”。据不完全统计，全省一千七百多个国营和社、队营的林业特产场圃，由于采取了“长短结合，以短养长”的方法，其中有三分之二以上的场圃在一两年内就做到了粮食、资金、肥料、饲料等自给。
    在营造用材林的规模上，各地根据国家建设、人民生活的需要和本地区的具体条件，本着就地生产、就地供应的原则，实行了以大为主导、大中小相结合。各地利用荒山、荒地、荒滩兴建了几万、几十万亩面积的大型基地。各地在搞大型用材林基地的同时，还充分利用“四旁”零星土地搞中、小型用材林，以解决公社用材和人民生活用材的需要。目前，各地正抓紧春播前的大好时机，开展了以营造用材林为中心的绿化“三荒”突击运动。（附图片）
