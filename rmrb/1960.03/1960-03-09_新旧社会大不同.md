    The Great Differences Between the Old and New Societies
    After reading the “Urgent Rescue Over a Thousand Li” published in your newspaper on February 7th, my heart remained stirred for a long time. After Hu Chunlin, a salesman from the Beijing Bamiantao Special Drug Store, received a phone call from the Secretary of the Pinglu County Party Committee requesting immediate support of a special drug due to food poisoning of migrant workers, the store's Party branch immediately established an emergency supply team; an Air Force unit immediately agreed to dispatch a special plane to airdrop the medicine; in order to facilitate finding the airdropped medicine at night, employees of the Wuzhou Electrical Appliance Store worked overnight to skillfully install lights on the medicine box. All of this fully embodies the warmth of our revolutionary big family.
    Recalling twenty-five years ago, my elder brother needed an injection of an expensive injectable drug due to a serious illness. Although there was a western pharmacy right next door to my house, because we had no money, the pharmacy owner refused to give us credit, and my elder brother's life was in danger. What could we do? In desperation, my mother had to harden her heart and sell me, who was less than one year old, to someone else (I didn't get in touch with my family until 1958). Due to the lack of timely treatment, my elder brother died not long after I was sold.
    But today, the comrades of the Beijing Special Drug Store and the Air Force unit and the Wuzhou Electrical Appliance Store can work together so wholeheartedly to rescue the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. How kind and precious is this revolutionary friendship between class brothers! This noble communist spirit of caring for others and helping others can only be produced under a superior social system.

    新旧社会大不同
    读了你报2月7日刊载的“千里急救”，心中久久不能平静下来。北京八面槽特种药品商店的业务员胡春林接到平陆县委书记因民工食物中毒请求立即支援特效药的电话后，商店党支部马上成立了紧急供应小组；空军某部立刻答应派遣专机投送药品；为了便于在夜间找到空投药品，五洲电料行职工又连夜在药物箱上巧装电灯。这一切充分体现了我们革命大家庭的温暖。
    回忆二十五年以前，我大哥因患重病需要注射一种价格昂贵的注射剂。虽然我家隔壁就是一家西药铺，因为没有钱，药铺老板不肯赊欠，大哥的性命危在旦夕，怎么办呢？在无可奈何的情况下，母亲只好狠了狠心，把不到一岁的我卖给了人家（直到1958年，我才同家里取得联系）。由于治疗不及时，在我被卖出后不几天，我大哥就死了。
    可是，今天，北京特种药品商店和空军某部、五洲电料行的同志为了急救千里以外素不相识的人的生命，却能那样同心同力，这种阶级兄弟间的革命友爱是多么的亲切而可贵！这种关心别人帮助别人的崇高的共产主义风格，只有在优越的社会制度下才能产生。
