    Specialization and Collaboration
    —An Important Question for Accelerating Industrial Technological Progress
    En. Karchev, Deputy Minister of Industry of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party
    The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a plenary session at the end of January this year to discuss issues of industrial and technological progress. This plenary session is of extremely great significance for realizing the Party's grand program of accelerating the development of the national economy and further improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people. The plenary session discussed important and mature issues such as the development of heavy industry, ensuring the raw material base of heavy industry, production collaboration and specialization, and accelerating the technological progress of the entire industry.
    The plenary session was convened against the backdrop of an unprecedented surge in the creative enthusiasm of workers, engineers, technicians, economic workers, and scientific workers. In the various reports, discussions, and resolutions of the plenary session, particular attention was paid to the issue of production specialization and collaboration.
    As the plenary session pointed out, one characteristic of our industry, especially the machine-building industry, is the wide variety of products. Our machine-building industry mainly carries out specialized production according to departments (such as agricultural machinery manufacturing plants, textile machinery plants, food industry machinery manufacturing plants, etc.). In addition, specialized production is also carried out according to product types. Examples of this include metal cutting machine tool plants, electric motor and transformer factories, electric cart factories, and steam boiler plants.
    The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party pointed out the achievements made in specialization and collaboration, and at the same time put forward the task of utilizing all possibilities to further improve specialization and collaboration.
    The further specialization of our industry will be carried out on the basis of fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation with socialist countries. Specialization will be carried out according to the following guidelines: reducing the variety of products in many enterprises by merging the same and technologically similar production processes, expanding and reconstructing existing specialized enterprises, and establishing new specialized enterprises.
    The specialization of enterprises will be carried out gradually and in stages, while taking into account the long-term plans for the development of industry and the entire national economy, the current equipment status and structure, the skill level of engineering and technical personnel and workers, and the recommendations of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and bilateral agreements signed with some socialist countries. The result of this will inevitably be the expansion of batch production, thereby increasing labor productivity and reducing product costs.
    In his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held on June 9, 1959, Todor Zhivkov pointed out: "Only by following the path of specialization and collaboration domestically and with the socialist camp countries can we eliminate the duplication in the production of machinery, equipment, and other industrial products in our country, reduce the variety of products, and increase the profitability of industrial enterprises."
    This is particularly relevant to the machine-building industry, because the machine-building industry is the leading sector, and it plays a decisive role in improving the technical level of our entire industry.
    In order for the machine-building industry to meet the needs of the national economy for machinery, equipment, and parts, a task has been put forward: to resolutely transition to detailed and centralized specialization according to technical operating procedures, and to raise specialization to a higher level. After this task is completed, standardized and uniformly sized parts and products produced by machine-building factories will be widely used. This is a prerequisite for organizing batch production, improving technology and technical operating procedures, and mastering the production of new types of machines and equipment in a short period of time.
    In many industrial sectors in our country, the conditions for establishing enterprises that carry out detailed specialized production already exist. According to the resolution of the plenary session, specific plans for industrialization and collaboration are currently being formulated with the participation of a wide range of experts and scientific workers. After analyzing the production status of some machine-building factories, finer specialization will be implemented based on the similarity of product structure and technical operating procedures.
    In order to further develop and specialize the telecommunications industry, preliminary plans have been made to separate certain products and produce them separately in new specialized enterprises. This will greatly expand the production of products that are conducive to the development of our country.
    In order to fully meet the needs of the national economy for standard cutting tools and measuring tools, the "Bolshevik" factory in Gabrovo will be expanded. At the same time, efforts are being made to reduce the variety of tool production and increase the batch production of certain major products through collaboration with factories in socialist countries. The plenary session pointed out the decisive significance of tools and equipment for the production of new machines, and therefore decided to specialize the tool workshops of machine-building factories, equip these workshops with modern machines, improve the technical operating procedures of tool production, and improve their quality.
    Adhesive materials (conducting devices, pulleys, etc.) occupy a large position in the standard parts of the machine-building industry, so many factories themselves produce a part of these parts. Therefore, the plenary session decided to transfer the production of adhesive materials to specialized enterprises.
    Foundry workshops will continue to be further specialized in order to more fully meet the country's needs for steel castings. This will be achieved through the expansion of collaboration among some enterprises and economic administrative regions. This will inevitably expand the batch production of castings, promote the mechanization of the entire production process, increase labor productivity, and reduce product costs.
    The plenary session pointed out the direction and possibilities of industrial specialization in our country, and also noted that improving our machine-building industry to achieve detailed specialization and collaboration is closely linked to the development of the machine-building industry in other socialist countries, member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.
    We do not need to add more machine-building industry sectors to completely meet our country's needs for all kinds of machines and equipment with our own strength. This can be achieved by relying on mutual collaboration among socialist countries in production and expanding and strengthening ties between countries, which may play a huge advantage for socialist international labor division. Therefore, it also creates the conditions for transitioning to large-scale mass production, thereby increasing labor productivity and reducing product costs.
    Close cooperation with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the implementation of the Party Central Committee's resolution on the specialization and collaboration of our industry, are prerequisites for realizing socialist expanded reproduction at a higher speed and accelerating the pace of our country's development.

    专业化和协作
    ——加速工业技术进步的重要问题
    保加利亚共产党中央工业部副部长  恩·卡尔切夫
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会在今年1月底召开全会，讨论了工业和技术进步问题。这次全会对于实现党所制订的加速发展国民经济和进一步提高劳动人民物质和文化生活水平的宏伟纲领，具有极其重大的意义。全会讨论了有关发展重工业、保证重工业的原料基地、生产的协作和专业化，以及加速整个工业的技术进步等重要的、成熟的问题。
    全会是在工人、工程师、技师、经济工作者、科学工作者的创造积极性空前高涨的情况下召开的。在全会的各项报告、讨论和决议中，引起特别注意的是关于生产的专业化和协作问题。
    正如全会所指出的，我国工业，特别是机器制造业有一个特点，那就是产品名目繁多。我国的机器制造业主要是按照部门进行专业化生产的（如农业机器制造厂、纺织机器厂、食品工业机器制造厂等）。另外，还按照品种进行专业化生产。属于这方面的有金属切削机床厂、电动马达和变压器工厂、电动小车厂、蒸汽锅炉厂等。
    保共中央全会指出了在专业化和协作方面取得的成就，同时提出了利用一切可能进一步改善专业化和协作的任务。
    我国工业的进一步专业化，将在同社会主义各国兄弟般的互助合作的基础上进行。专业化将按照这样的方针进行：减少许多企业产品的品种，其方法是把同样的和技术操作过程相类似的生产进行合并，扩大和改建现有的专业化企业，建立新的专业化企业。
    企业的专业化将逐步地、分阶段地进行，同时要考虑到工业和整个国民经济发展的远景计划、现有的设备状况和结构、工程技术人员和工人的熟练程度，还要考虑到经济互助委员会的建议和同一些社会主义国家签订的双边协定。这样作的结果，必然会扩大产品的成批生产，从而提高劳动生产率，降低产品的成本。
    托多尔·日夫科夫在1959年6月9日召开的保共中央全会上作的报告中指出：“只有走国内及同社会主义阵营国家实行专业化和协作的道路，我们才可能消灭我国机器、设备和其他工业品生产中的重复现象，减少产品的名目和提高工业企业的赢利性。”
    这特别与机器制造业有关，因为机器制造业是主导部门，它在提高我国整个工业的技术水平方面起有决定性的作用。
    为了使机器制造业满足国民经济对机器、设备和零件的需要，提出了一项任务：以坚决过渡到按照技术操作规程进行细致的、集中的专业化的办法，把专业化提到更高的水平。这项任务完成后，机器制造厂生产的标准化的、规格统一的零件和产品将会得到广泛的利用。这是为了组织成批生产，改进技术和技术操作规程，为了在短期间掌握新型机器和设备的生产的先决条件。
    在我国许多的工业部门中，已经具备建立进行细致专业化生产的企业的条件。根据全会的决议，目前正在广大专家和科学工作者参加之下制订工业化和协作的具体计划。对一些机器制造厂的生产状况进行分析后，将要根据产品的结构和技术操作规程相近的情况，实行较细致的专业化。
    为了使电讯工业得到进一步的发展和专业化，已经制订了使某些产品分开单独在新的专业化企业里生产的初步计划。这样作就可以大大扩大那些对我国来说具备有利条件发展的产品生产。
    为了充分满足国民经济对标准的切削工具和测量工具的需要，将要扩建加布罗沃市的“布尔什维克”工厂。同时，正在设法减少工具生产的品种，并通过同社会主义国家工厂的协作来增加某些主要产品的成批生产。全会指出了工具和设备对于生产新机器的决定意义，因此决定要使机器制造厂的工具车间专业化，用现代化机器充实这些车间，改进工具生产的技术操作规程并提高其质量。
    粘合材料（传导装置、皮带轮等），在机器制造业的标准零件中占有很大的位置，因此很多工厂自己在生产一部分这种零件。因此，全会决定把粘合材料的生产转移给专门的企业生产。
    将要使铸造车间继续进一步专业化，以便更加充分地满足国家对钢铁铸件的需要。这将通过扩大一些企业和经济行政区的协作的办法来实现。这样作必然会扩大铸件的成批生产，促使整个生产过程机械化，提高劳动生产率并降低产品成本。
    全会指出了我国工业专业化的方向和可能性，同时并注意到改进我国机器制造业，使其实现细致的专业化和协作，是同其他社会主义国家、经济互助委员会会员国机器制造业的发展密切联系的。
    我们没有必要再增加一些机器制造业部门，完全用自己的力量满足我国对各式各样机器和设备的需要。这一点可以依靠社会主义国家在生产方面的相互协作，扩大和加强各国之间的联系来作到，这样就可能发挥社会主义国际劳动分工的巨大优越性。因此也就创造了过渡到大规模的大批的生产，从而提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本的条件。
    密切同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的合作，实现党中央关于我国工业专业化和协作的决议，是实现以更高的速度进行社会主义扩大再生产和加快我国发展速度的先决条件。
