Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 9th: Shandong Province's anti-drought army of over 8.5 million people, fighting from February 26th to March 6th for ten days, irrigated over 40 million mu of wheat with greening water, loosened soil to conserve moisture on over 16.8 million mu of wheat fields, and top-dressed over 50 million mu with returning green fertilizer, achieving victory in the first crucial stage for a good wheat harvest – the greening stage.

Since the beginning of spring, there has been very little rainfall in Shandong. People's Communes in various areas responded to the call of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to "make drought prevention and resistance the overriding central task of the moment," launching a vigorous anti-drought and wheat-watering campaign. Penglai County mobilized 120,000 people, launching a massive campaign to combat drought and water wheat. By the end of February, the entire county's 820,000 mu of wheat had been top-dressed with returning green fertilizer and watered.

In the anti-drought campaign, various areas actively explored new water sources and expanded irrigation areas. Wulian County adopted methods such as repairing, digging, diverting, intercepting, blocking, merging, inverting, and erecting to dig new water sources. Due to these measures, the wheat fields in the plains and highlands, near and far from water, were irrigated with adequate water. Rongcheng County, an area with poor water conservancy conditions, through the hard work of the broad masses of commune members, built over 4,400 dams on 578 large and small rivers in three days, intercepting over 9 million cubic meters of water; at the same time, they dug pits, ponds, and mountain springs, and tapped underground springs, expanding the irrigated area by over 215,000 mu, ensuring that all the county's wheat fields were watered.

Various areas also focused on repairing and manufacturing water-lifting tools during the anti-drought campaign. The Changwei area mobilized factory workers to repair 637 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery, and over 30,000 waterwheels and simple water-lifting tools, strongly supporting the anti-drought struggle. The Jinan area organized over 9,200 iron and wood workers to go deep into the fields to repair water-lifting tools as soon as they broke.

Commercial, health, and other departments also actively supported the anti-drought struggle. The Liaocheng city commercial department cleared out waterwheels, fertilizers, diesel engines, and other materials from warehouses and rushed them to the countryside, and actively dispatched 17 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery to support drought resistance. The Wulian County health department organized 287 medical personnel to go deep into the fields, working and providing medical treatment at the same time.

Party secretaries at all levels and the broad masses of cadres went to the front lines to participate in and lead the anti-drought effort. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally went to Penglai County to convene an on-site meeting on wheat field management, summarizing experiences and promoting them. Li Jiping, First Secretary of the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee, deeply summarized the experience of the Laoguanzhai Commune in Linqing City in digging underground springs of hundreds of feet in water ports to expand the irrigated area, and immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote it. Due to the personal leadership of the first secretaries of Party organizations at all levels and the participation of cadres in production, the anti-drought campaign was greatly promoted.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 9th: Under the slogan "Ensure Sowing Without Spring Rains, Ensure Summer Harvest Without Hundred Days of Rain, Ensure a Good Harvest Despite Summer and Autumn Droughts and Floods," Hebei Province has launched a magnificent struggle to prevent, resist, and eliminate drought. As of March 5th, the province's protected irrigation area has surged from 45 million mu last year to over 70 million mu, with a total spring irrigation area of over 31.8 million mu, of which wheat fields account for over 13.9 million mu. In addition, over 40 million mu of land has been harrowed to conserve moisture.

Since last winter, rainfall and snowfall have been scarce in Hebei Province, and drought conditions have appeared in many areas. Based on the current soil moisture and the favorable situation in rural areas, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China specially convened a mobilization broadcast meeting, issuing a battle call to the people of the province to "urgently mobilize the whole Party and all the people to resist drought to ensure sowing and a good harvest, and resolutely win a complete victory in the fight against drought." Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of cadres, and members of the People's Communes across the province responded with a fighting attitude. In the movement, Party organizations at all levels were led by secretaries who established anti-drought leadership organizations and sent a large number of cadres to the front lines of the anti-drought effort. Baoding transferred over 8,000 cadres at the secretary, section, and bureau chief levels from Party organizations and leading organs at all levels, adopting a division-of-labor contract system to lead the masses in carrying out drought elimination assault battles. The number of people投入的抗旱斗争 in the Shijiazhuang area rapidly increased from more than 1 million to 2.5 million.

Focusing on high standards and tackling weak links are prominent features of the in-depth anti-drought struggle throughout the province. Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, and other areas with better water conservancy conditions, in conjunction with drought resistance, also put forward the slogan of marching towards high-standard water conservancy. Among them, in order to realize high-standard water conservancy, various communes in Ding County mobilized commune members to launch a ten-day assault, building 1,360 branch, farm, and capillary canals in the county's square fields, forming a canal irrigation network. While focusing on high-standard water conservancy, Party committees at all levels also concentrated manpower, materials, and financial resources to focus on water conservancy construction in mountainous areas, highlands, low-lying areas, backward areas, and areas lacking water sources. The broad masses of commune members in the Chengde mountainous area worked hard and practically, building 1.84 million mu of terraced fields in 45 days. Ji County, with few surface water sources and a lot of dry land, intercepted 9.5 cubic meters per second of the abundant subsurface flow between the cover layers of old riverbeds, expanding the irrigated area by 200,000 mu. The Shenghuo Commune in Yanshan, a saline-alkali low-lying area, mobilized the entire Party and all the people, built 111 machine wells and more than 7,000 brick and earth wells, and at the same time, repaired field drainage and irrigation projects. In four days, they irrigated 16,000 mu of land with fresh water to suppress salt and wash away alkali.

In the anti-drought struggle, People's Communes in various areas also carried out large-scale cooperation in a communist style, supporting communes and teams with insufficient water sources and tools. Da Zhao and other communes in Leting County suffered from severe drought conditions. The Cheng Guan, Jiang Liu, and other six communes mobilized 30,000 anti-drought troops, bringing their own tools to organize multi-well and multi-canal irrigation, helping them to rush irrigate 31,000 mu of land in just two days.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 9th: Under the leadership of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of Gansu are carrying out a drought prevention and resistance movement, striving for an even greater agricultural harvest this year. Since last winter, most areas of Gansu Province have had very little snowfall, and many places are currently experiencing drought. To this end, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference in mid-February and issued an emergency directive, mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to launch a large-scale drought prevention and resistance movement to seize a greater, better, and more comprehensive harvest in agricultural production. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, all localities first educated cadres and the masses to abandon the idea of relying on heaven for rain, and to overcome drought in every possible way. Secondly, they focused on water conservancy and accelerated spring irrigation. At the same time, they also mobilized industrial and mining enterprises, finance and trade systems, universities, scientific institutions, people's organizations, etc., to vigorously support drought prevention and resistance work.

After adopting the above measures, the anti-drought struggle has achieved great results throughout the province. More than 1.88 million people were mobilized to vigorously develop water conservancy and irrigation, making the spring irrigation speed rise sharply. By the end of February, the province's spring irrigation area had increased by more than eight and a half times compared with the same period last year. More than 288,000 wells and more than 323,000 springs have been dug throughout the province. In addition, more than 2 million mu of cultivated land has been watered by carrying water. Tianshui Prefecture also reclaimed a large number of shady and damp wasteland to expand insured fields, based on the principle of planting more and harvesting more. Xili County mobilized more than 110,000 people and 2,400 head of livestock to go up the mountains and into the gullies, and by mid-February, had reclaimed more than 112,000 mu of shady and damp wasteland. A large number of high-yield and drought-resistant seeds have also been prepared throughout the province. Industrial and mining enterprises in Lanzhou, Yumen, Baiyin, Jiuquan, Zhangye and other cities also supported farmers in preventing and resisting drought in terms of manpower, materials, and technology through various methods such as contracting by districts and linking factories with communes.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 9th: Qinghai Province's drought prevention and resistance movement, centered on a spring ploughing assault and early sowing while moisture is maintained, has achieved great success. To date, the province has sown more than 2.75 million mu of spring wheat, highland barley, and other food crops while moisture is maintained. The sowing time is generally 20 days to a month earlier than last year, and the sowing quality is better than in previous years.

Since last winter, rainfall and snowfall have been scarce in various parts of Qinghai. In order to overcome the drought that may occur, commune members in various areas have launched drought prevention activities since the end of last year. By the time of sowing, the province had rolled more than 4.35 million mu of land to preserve moisture, carried ice to moisten more than 140,000 mu of fields, and swept snow back to more than 220,000 mu of fields. At the end of January this year, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China further called on people of all ethnic groups in the province to prevent and resist drought, assault spring ploughing, and sow early while maintaining moisture, striving for a bumper harvest even if it does not rain. According to the call of the Provincial Committee, all communes generally sow while the frozen soil thaws to two inches, and carefully harrow and grind before and after sowing to ensure that the ground is level, the soil is crushed, and the soil moisture is sufficient. In order to seize soil moisture, all communes generally broke the old rules of the past in the order of sowing. Generally, mountain land is sown before water land, sunny slopes are sown before shady slopes, and non-drought-resistant crops are sown first, and then drought-resistant crops are sown. In the sowing process, communes and communes, and the river valley and mountain areas, carried out large-scale cooperation and support in manpower, farm implements, and animal power, accelerating the sowing progress and enhancing the effect of drought prevention. Now, while accelerating spring sowing, each commune is trying to water the sown fields to ensure full and vigorous seedlings.

The water conservancy projects built by people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province in the winter of last year have now released water for irrigation, playing a role in drought prevention and resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 9th: The large-scale anti-drought struggle in various parts of Fujian has achieved great success. To date, the province's early rice soaking has reached more than 90 million jin, and more than 700,000 mu of sowing and seedling raising have been completed, which are 40% to 50% faster than the same period last year. Some areas have already started transplanting seedlings, and direct sowing of early rice has begun.

There has been no thorough rain in various parts of Fujian for several months. In order to overcome the spring drought, Party organizations at all levels in various areas have, according to the instructions of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, been led by the first secretary of the Party committee, and the entire Party and all the people have been urgently mobilized to launch a large-scale anti-drought spring ploughing movement. Longxi, Jinjiang, Minhou, Fuan, Xiamen and other prefectures (cities) with severe drought conditions have mobilized a total of one million people, using more than 600,000 pieces of various anti-drought tools, with the heroic spirit of "declaring war on the sky and demanding water from the earth," and launched a battle against the spring drought. Along the main river in Jinjiang Prefecture—the Jinjiang River—Anxi, Nan'an, Jinjiang, and Quanzhou, four counties and cities, all communes broke county, commune, and team boundaries, cooperated closely, mobilized 100,000 troops, and built river dams, cutting off the Jinjiang River's main stream and tributaries section by section, forcing the rolling river water flowing eastward into the sea into the canals on both sides, irrigating drought-stricken fields. After Jinjiang County blocked the Jinjiang River alone, the irrigation area of the Jinji Canal expanded from the original 120,000 mu to 370,000 mu due to the increase in the water level in the canal. Factories and commune-run farm tool factories in the Longxi Prefecture are rushing to make water-lifting tools to support drought resistance. At present, the entire district has drought-resistant dissolved fields of more than 700,000 mu, accounting for more than 40% of the area that should be dissolved, and has basically completed the task of early rice sowing and seedling raising. Most of the spring harvest crops have been watered more than once.

Recently, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has once again called on all localities to fight hard in March and April to complete the spring sowing plan without losing an acre.

    抗旱保播种　抗旱保丰收
    山东、河北、甘肃、青海、福建五省初获战果
    山东
    据新华社济南9日电　山东省八百五十多万名抗旱大军，从2月26日到3月6日奋战十天，给四千多万亩小麦浇了返青水，对一千六百八十多万亩麦田进行了松土保墒；还追返青肥五千多万亩，取得了小麦丰收第一关——返青关的胜利。
    山东各地入春以来雨水很少。各地人民公社响应了中共山东省委发出的“防旱抗旱为当前压倒一切的中心任务”的号召，掀起了气势磅礴的抗旱浇麦运动。蓬莱县出动十二万人，展开了千军万马的抗旱浇麦运动。全县八十二万亩小麦，到2月底已全部追完了返青肥，浇完了返青水。
    在抗旱运动中，各地积极挖掘新的水源，扩大灌溉面积。五莲县采取修、挖、引、截、阻、并、倒、架等方法大挖新水源。由于采取这些措施，这个县的平原和高岗地，近田和远地麦田都浇到了适量的水。荣成县是水利条件很差的一个县，经过广大社员的巧干，三天内在五百七十八条大小河流上筑坝四千四百多条，拦水九百多万方；同时，大挖坑塘、山泉，淘井下泉，扩大灌溉面积二十一万五千多亩，使全县麦田全部浇上了返青水。
    各地在抗旱运动中大抓提水工具修理、制造，昌潍专区发动各工厂职工整修排灌机械六百三十七台，水车和简易提水工具各三万多件，有力地支援了抗旱斗争。济南地区组织了九千二百多名铁木工人，深入田间做到提水工具随坏随修。
    各地商业、卫生等部门也积极地支援抗旱斗争。聊城市商业部门从仓库里清出水车、化肥、柴油机等物资突击运往农村，并主动抽出十七部排灌机械支援抗旱。五莲县卫生部门组织了二百八十七名医务人员，深入田间，边劳动，边医疗。
    各级党委书记和广大干部都亲临前线，参加抗旱领导抗旱。中共山东省委第一书记舒同亲到蓬莱县召开麦田管理现场会议，总结经验，进行推广。聊城地委第一书记李吉平深入总结了临清市老官寨公社在水港中挖百丈地下泉，扩大灌溉面积的经验，并立即召开现场会议推广。由于各级党组织第一书记亲自挂帅，干部参加生产，大大促进了抗旱运动的进展。
    河北
    本报天津9日电　河北省在“春季无雨保播种，百日无雨保夏收，夏秋旱涝保丰收”的口号下，掀起了规模壮阔的防旱抗旱灭旱的斗争。到3月5日统计，全省保浇面积已由去年的四千五百万亩猛增到七千万亩以上，春灌面积共达三千一百八十多万亩，其中麦田占一千三百九十多万亩。另外还有四千多万亩土地进行了耙地保墒。
    河北省从去冬以来，境内雨雪稀少，不少地区出现旱情。根据当前墒情和农村有利形势，中共河北省委特地召开了誓师动员广播大会，向全省人民发出了“全党全民紧急动员起来，抗旱保播种、抗旱保丰收，坚决赢得抗旱彻底胜利”的战斗号召。全省各级党委、广大干部和人民公社社员，都以战斗的姿态群起响应。在运动中，各地各级党组织，都由书记挂帅，建立了抗旱领导机构，并抽出大批干部走向抗旱第一线。保定从各级党组织和领导机关抽调书记、科局长级干部八千多人，采取分工包干的办法，领导群众，开展灭旱突击战。石家庄地区投入抗旱斗争的人数迅速由一百多万人，猛增到二百五十万。
    大抓高标准，狠突薄弱关，是全省深入开展抗旱斗争的一个突出特点。水利条件较好的保定、石家庄、邯郸等专区结合抗旱，又提出了向高标准水利化进军的口号。其中，定县各公社为了实现高标准水利化，发动社员突击十多天，就在全县方田内增修斗、农、毛渠一千三百六十条，建成了一套渠灌网。各地各级党委在大抓高标准水利化的同时，还集中人力、物力、财力，狠抓山区、高地、洼地、落后地区和缺乏水源地区的水利建设。承德山区的广大社员，苦干实干，在四十五天中就修成水平梯田一百八十四万亩。地上水源少、旱田很多的蓟县，把旧河床复盖层间的丰富潜流，截出九点五秒立米，扩大灌溉面积二十万亩。盐碱低洼地区的盐山圣佛公社全党全民总动员，因地制宜打机井一百零一眼，砖井土井七千多眼，同时修好田间排灌工程，四天就用淡水浇地压盐洗碱一万六千亩。
    各地人民公社在抗旱斗争中，还以共产主义风格开展大协作，支援水源、工具不足的社、队。乐亭县大钊等公社旱情严重，城关、江流等六个公社就动员三万名抗旱大军，自带工具，组织多井多渠灌溉，只两天时间就帮助他们突击浇地三万一千亩。
    甘肃
    据新华社兰州9日电　甘肃人民在中共甘肃省委领导下开展防旱抗旱运动，力争今年农业更大丰收。甘肃省多数地区从去年冬天到现在，落雪很少，目前不少地方呈现旱象。中共甘肃省委为此在2月中旬召开了电话会议，并发出紧急指示，动员全党全民开展一个大规模的防旱抗旱运动，夺取农业生产更大更好更全面的丰收。根据省委指示，各地都首先教育干部和群众丢掉靠天等雨的思想，千方百计，战胜干旱。其次，大抓水利，加快春灌。同时还发动工矿企业、财贸系统、大专学校、科学机关、人民团体等，大力支援防旱抗旱的工作。
    全省各地采取上述措施后，防旱抗旱斗争已经取得了巨大成绩。各地出动了一百八十八万多人大兴水利，大抓灌溉，使春灌速度直线上升。到2月底止，全省春灌面积比去年同期增加了八倍半还多。全省已打井二十八万八千多眼，挖泉三十二万三千多处。另外，还担水泼浇点灌耕地二百多万亩。天水专区还本着多种多收方针开垦了大批阴湿荒地，扩大保险田。西礼县出动十一万多人和两千四百多头牲畜，上山进沟，到2月中旬已开垦阴湿荒地十一万二千多亩。全省各地还准备了大批高产耐旱的籽种。兰州、玉门、白银市、酒泉、张掖等城市的工矿企业，还用分片包干、厂社挂钩等多种方式，从人力、物力、技术方面支援农民防旱、抗旱。
    青海
    据新华社西宁9日电　青海省以突击春耕、抢墒早播为中心的防旱抗旱运动，已经获得很大成绩，到目前止，全省已经趁墒播种春小麦和青稞等粮食作物二百七十五万多亩，播种时间一般比去年提前二十多天到一个月，播种质量比往年好。
    去冬以来，青海各地雨雪稀少，为了战胜可能发生的旱象，从去年年底开始，各地人民公社社员就展开了防旱活动，到播种时，全省已轧地保墒四百三十五万多亩，背冰润田十四万多亩，扫雪归田二十二万多亩。今年1月底，中共青海省委又进一步号召全省各族人民防旱抗旱，突击春耕，抢墒早播，即使不下雨也要争取大丰收。根据省委的号召，各公社普遍在冻土化到两寸时就趁墒下种，并在播前播后仔细耙磨，做到地平土碎，墒气充足。为了抢墒气，各公社在播种次序上普遍打破往年陈规，一般都先种山地后种水地，先种阳坡后种阴坡，先种不耐旱作物，后种耐旱作物。在播种中，公社与公社之间，川地与山地之间，开展了人力、农具、畜力的大协作、大支援，加快了播种进度和增强了防旱的效果。现在，各公社一面加速春播，一面对已播田地设法浇水，保证苗全苗旺。
    青海省各族人民在去年冬季兴修的水利工程，现在已有一部分放水浇地，在防旱抗旱中起了作用。
    福建
    据新华社福州9日电　福建各地大规模的抗旱斗争已经获得巨大成就。到目前止，全省早稻浸种已达九千多万斤，播种育秧七十多万亩，分别比去年同期快40％到50％，部分地区已经开始插秧，直播的早稻已经开始播种。
    福建各地几个月来都没有下过透雨。为了战胜春旱，各地各级党组织都根据中共福建省委的指示，由党委第一书记挂帅，全党全民紧急动员，掀起了大规模的抗旱春耕运动。旱情较重的龙溪、晋江、闽侯、福安、厦门等专区（市），共出动了一百万人，使用各种抗旱工具六十多万件，以“向天宣战、向地要水”的英雄气概，同春旱展开了搏斗。晋江专区主要河流——晋江沿岸的安溪、南安、晋江和泉州等四个县市，各公社打破县界、社界和队界，通力协作，发动十万雄师，大修拦河坝，段段腰斩晋江干流和支流，把滚滚东流入海的江水，逼入两岸各条渠道，灌溉受旱田地。单是晋江县堵截晋江后，金鸡渠由于渠内水位提高，灌溉面积就由原来的十二万亩扩大到三十七万亩。龙溪专区各工厂和社办农具厂都赶制提水工具，支援抗旱，现在全区已经抗旱溶田七十多万亩，占应溶面积40％多，并已基本完成早稻播种育秧任务，春收作物大部浇灌一遍以上。
    最近中共福建省委又号召各地，大战3、4月，一亩不少地完成春季播种计划。
