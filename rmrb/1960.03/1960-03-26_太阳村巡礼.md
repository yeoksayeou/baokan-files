    A Tour of Sun Village
    By our reporters Dong Shu, Pei Zhi, Sha Yin

    During our short visit to Sun Village, a renowned model village for sanitation in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, we witnessed many inspiring things.

    First Impressions

    Upon arriving in Sun Village, we heard this jingle:

    The environment is tidy and the atmosphere is new,
    Pines, cypresses, and willows provide shade.
    The street gardens are beautiful,
    The air is fresh, and people live longer.
    Look at the streets, how lovely,
    Flat roads and snow-white walls.
    Look at the courtyards, how refreshing,
    Flowers and plants fill the yard with fragrance.
    Look at the homes, how comfortable,
    Beds are tidy and the floors are clean.
    Every family has three new treasures:
    Spittoons, toothbrushes, and teacups.

    After our visit, we felt that this jingle truly reflects the sanitary conditions of Sun Village.

    Here, all the streets are smoothly paved and thoroughly cleaned. Rows of newly planted small pine trees, cypress trees, and Chinese locust trees line both sides, and all the walls are whitewashed with lime. The walls are adorned with many colorful sanitation posters, and various sanitation pledges, regulations, and rules are written on them. There are over a hundred street gardens with various beautiful and fragrant flowers such as peonies and roses. Public toilets are located in the open spaces at the four corners of the village. The toilets are clean. All the wells and wellheads are raised above the ground and covered with lids. Spittoons and trash cans are placed along the roads and in all public places.

    The villagers' homes have all been renovated and refreshed. The courtyards and rooms are kept very tidy. Everything a farming household should have is arranged in an orderly manner. There are also courtyard ponds, where various flowers and plants are grown. Pigs have new "residences," and chickens have moved into "three-story buildings" (modern chicken coops). Every household has a "homemade" water tap in front of their door, and villagers use this running water to wash their hands and faces when they return from the fields or before and after meals. What caught our attention was the windows. The windows used to be small, but recently they have been greatly modified to be wider and more flexible, allowing them to be opened and closed at will. This allows the air inside the rooms to circulate and stay fresh. People call this modification the "window revolution."

    Excellent Collective Sanitation

    The director of the management district enthusiastically invited us to visit the village's collective health and welfare facilities.

    The hygiene of the public canteens left a deep impression on us. This village has five canteens, and their hygiene is no worse than that of many urban institutional canteens. The kitchens all have "remote stoves," also known as "dust-free stoves," where the fire is separated from the cooking area; the fire is stoked outside, and the food is prepared inside. Smoke and dust cannot enter the room, the cooks have a better working environment, and the kitchen is kept clean at all times. A method called "good water doesn't enter the door, dirty water doesn't leave the door" is used for water. The water that is carried in is first poured into a filtration pond in the yard, and then it flows through pipes into the water tanks in the rooms. There are drainage pipes for dirty water in the rooms. Even the cutting boards are divided into raw food boards and cooked food boards to prevent bacteria from raw food from spreading to cooked food. The canteens also have running water washbasins, mouthwash stations, dishwashing stations, and disinfection stations.

    The sanitary conditions of the canteens are already satisfactory, but there are still many new things. For example, nutritional surveys. Last August, a nutritional survey of food was conducted here. Based on the results of the survey, a menu was proposed, specifying the types and quantities of staple and non-staple foods each person should have daily. The human body can obtain 2,550 calories from these foods, and with the addition of fruits, the human body can obtain more than 2,600 calories. The canteens cook and stir-fry dishes according to this menu every day, and the management district also produces vegetables according to this menu.

    The sanitation of the canteens is good, and the sanitation of other welfare units is also good. Kindergartens, homes for the elderly, cultural palaces... truly "every place has regulations, every matter has a pact." The village has also established a shower bathhouse.

    People are Cared for in This Way

    Under the socialist system, people receive meticulous care. This truth is very evident in the sanitation work of Sun Village. We visited the maternity hospital next to the village health station. The east building has three rooms, one delivery room and one waiting room. The equipment in the delivery room is almost the same as what we have seen in urban hospitals. The difference is that there are also some very practical local equipment. The west building has three rooms, which are for postpartum mothers to rest. The south building is the infant feeding room.

    When we visited, there were twelve infants in the feeding room, and the childcare worker was washing the infants' clothes. According to the guide, this set of facilities is used as follows: pregnant women move into the waiting room half a month before giving birth and can recuperate in the hospital for a month after giving birth. The management district subsidizes eggs and brown sugar. After being discharged from the hospital, they can put their infants in the feeding room while they work, and the feeding room provides goat milk free of charge. After six months, the infants are transferred to the nursery. The children in the nursery are all well-fed and plump, dressed neatly and cleanly, and they are growing up in civilization and happiness.

    The management district has stipulated a "three adjustments, three no-adjustments" system, which means adjusting dry work but not wet work during menstruation, adjusting light work but not heavy work during pregnancy, and adjusting nearby work but not distant work during lactation. This method is very popular among the villagers. Here, not only women enjoy labor protection, but men do too. Cooks, breeders, workers, and others all have corresponding systems to protect their health during production. The villagers told us: Sun Village has "labor protection systems everywhere, and health workers visit every home."

    Sanitation Basic Construction Has Begun

    We walked into a newly built courtyard, which is the health station. Just inside the door is the pharmacy and laboratory, the east room is the surgical clinic, and the north room is the internal medicine clinic. The doctor is Wu Lilong, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner with more than 30 years of medical experience. He is very skilled in acupuncture and also understands many Western medicine principles. The lab technician is a high school graduate and also a half-baked surgeon. There are more than 4,200 kinds of medicines.

    However, there are really not many people who come here for treatment, and most of them are for minor injuries such as broken hands or tracheal inflammation. Although there are few patients, there is no shortage of work, and people are busy with basic construction. Since the launch of the sanitation campaign in Sun Village, no one in the village has contracted an infectious disease from 1955 to the present, and even pigs, chickens, and livestock have not suffered from infectious diseases. Now they are treating those diseases that people did not pay attention to in the past, such as trachoma, roundworms, and dental caries. The village has established "health record bags for villagers" to clarify who in the village is susceptible to what bacteria and who has what common chronic diseases. Doctors at the health station actively go to treat villagers with minor illnesses, and doctors participate in the eradication of diseases in a planned way. The reporters looked at those family health records, stack after stack, and the project is indeed not small.

    Here, a "collective medical system" is implemented, in which villagers pay a health care fee of two yuan per person per year, and they do not have to pay for medical treatment afterward. Last year, the Sun Village Health Station received a total of more than 1,800 yuan in health care fees. After deducting the doctors' salaries, the construction costs were 700 to 800 yuan, and there was still a surplus.

    Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts

    Here, hygienic habits are deeply rooted in people's hearts. Whether adults or children, if they find a bit of paper scraps or cigarette butts on the street, they will automatically pick it up and put it in the trash can; if someone spits on the ground, they will be advised or criticized.

    Here, health knowledge is also well popularized. People from the age of ten to sixty all understand a lot of scientific health knowledge, know what bacteria cause certain diseases, what seasons they are most likely to be infected in, and how to prevent them. Their methods of publicizing health knowledge are flexible and diverse. Party schools, League schools, civil schools, and Red and Expert schools have all added health courses; villagers' meetings are held, or ten minutes are taken out before watching a play or a movie to publicize health knowledge; the health station has also compiled a "Health Knowledge Handbook," and everyone has a copy, which they carry with them and study anytime, anywhere.

    The changes in Sun Village are really too great. And many changes have taken place in the recent year. No wonder the enthusiastic director of the management district excitedly said: People's communes have created extremely favorable conditions for large-scale health undertakings, the work has become easier, and the changes have become even greater.

    太阳村巡礼
    本报记者　东书　培植　莎荫
    记者访问著名的卫生模范村——山西省稷山县太阳村时，在短促的时间里看到了许多激动人心的事情。
    最初的印象
    一到太阳村，就听到这么几句顺口溜：
    环境整洁气象新，松柏杨柳绿成荫。街心花园景色秀，空气新鲜人增寿。街里看，多漂亮，平坦的马路雪白的墙。院里看，多清爽，花草一院满庭香。家里看，多舒畅，床上整洁地净光。家家多了三件宝：痰盂、牙刷和茶缸。
    参观之后，感到这几句顺口溜确是太阳村卫生面貌的真实写照。
    这里，所有的街道都修的平平坦坦的，打扫的干干净净。两侧整齐地排列着新栽的小松树、小柏树和小杨槐树，所有的墙壁都用石灰刷得雪白。墙上画着许多彩色的卫生宣传画，写着各种各样的卫生公约、卫生制度和卫生守则。街头有一百多个街头花园，栽着牡丹、玫瑰等多种美丽芬芳的花草。公共厕所设在村四角的空地上。进了厕所，干干净净。所有的水井、井口都高出平地，盖上了盖子。痰盂、垃圾箱设置在路旁和一切公共场所。
    社员的住宅已经全部整修刷新。院里、屋里都弄得非常整洁。农家应该有的一切东西，都摆得井井有序。还有庭院池，也栽着各种花草。猪有新式“住宅”，鸡也搬进了“三层楼”（现代化鸡窝），家家门前都有土自来水，社员们下地回来或者饭前饭后都用这种流水洗手洗脸。引起我们注意的，还有窗户。过去窗户狭小，最近也大大改装了，变得宽敞、灵活，可以任意开关。这样，室内的空气就流通了，新鲜了。人们把这种改装叫做“窗户革命”。
    满好的集体卫生
    管理区主任热情地邀请我们参观了村里的集体卫生福利设施。
    公共食堂的卫生工作给我们留下了深刻的印象。这个村有五个食堂，卫生工作做得不比城市许多机关食堂差。厨房都是“隔山灶”，也叫“无尘灶”，就是把烧火和做饭分开，外边烧火，屋里做饭。烟雾、灰尘进不了屋，炊事员们的工作环境好了，厨房里也经常保持清洁。用水实行了一种叫“好水不进门，脏水不出门”的办法。抬来的水先倒进院里的滤水池，然后通过管道流进屋里的水缸中，屋里有脏水输送管道。连切菜的案板也分成生菜案和熟菜案，避免生菜上的细菌传到熟菜上。食堂里还有流水洗脸台、嗽口水台、洗碗水台、消毒水台。
    食堂的卫生状况已经使人够满意了，可是还有许多新鲜东西。比如营养调查就是一例。去年8月，这里对食物进行了一次营养调查，根据调查结果，提出了一个食谱，规定了每人每天的主食和副食种类、数量，人体可以从这些食物中得到热量二千五百五十克，再加上瓜果，人体得到的热量就高过二千六百克了。食堂每天都根据这个食谱做饭，炒菜，管理区也根据这个食谱生产蔬菜。
    食堂的卫生好，其他福利事业单位的卫生也好。幼儿园、敬老院、文化宫…，真是“处处有制度，事事有公约”，村里还建立了淋浴澡塘。
    人被这样爱护着
    人在社会主义制度下，受到的关怀是无微不至的。这条真理在太阳村卫生工作中看得非常明显。我们参观了村里保健站隔壁的妇产院，东房三间，有一间分娩室，一间待产室。分娩室的设备差不多和我们在城市医院见过的一样。不同的是这里还有一些很适用的土设备。西屋三间，是产妇休息的地方。南屋是婴儿哺乳室。
    我们参观时，哺乳室有十二个婴儿，保育员正在洗濯婴儿的衣服。据向导人介绍：这一套设施是这样使用的：孕妇在临产前半个月就搬进待产室，产后可以在院里休养一个月，管理区补贴鸡蛋、红糖。出院后劳动时，可以把婴儿放到哺乳室，哺乳室免费供应羊奶。六个月以后，婴儿就转入托儿所。在托儿所的幼儿，个个都吃得又白又胖；穿得整整齐齐，干干净净，他们在文明、幸福中成长。
    管理区规定了“三调三不调”制度，就是经期调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳期调近不调远。这办法很受社员拥护。这里不光妇女享受了劳动保护，男人也一样，炊事员、饲养员、工人和其它人，都有相应的制度，在生产中保护他们的健康。社员告诉我们：太阳村是“劳保制度处处有，保健人员家家走”。卫生基本建设开工了
    走进一座新建的院子里，这里是保健站。一进门就是药房和化验室，东屋是外科诊室，北屋是内科诊室。大夫是一位有三十多年医务工作经历的中医——吴李龙，针灸技术很好，也懂许多西医药理。化验员是个中学毕业生，还是个半把手的外科医生。药品有四千二百多种。
    可是这里看病的人实在不多，有也多是碰破手的，气管发炎的一般小伤小病。病人少，但工作可不闲，人们正在闹基本建设。太阳村自从开展卫生运动以来，从1955年到现在全村没有一个得过传染病的人，就连猪、鸡和牲畜也没有发生过传染病。他们现在是根治那些过去人们不注意的病，如砂眼、蛔虫、龋齿等。村里建立了“社员的健康情况档案袋”，把全村人谁容易感染什么菌、谁有什么一般慢性病弄清楚了。保健站的医生就主动地去给那些有小病的社员去治病，医生有计划地参加消灭疾病工作。记者看了那些家庭健康档案，一叠一叠地，工程确实不小。
    这里实行一种“集体医疗制度”，就是社员每人每年交两元保健费，以后看病不要钱。去年太阳村保健站一共收了一千八百多元保健费，除去医生工资，建设费用花了七八百元外，还有节余。
    深入人心
    这里卫生习惯已深入人心。无论大人或小孩发现在街道有一点纸屑、烟头，就会自动把它拾到垃圾箱里；如果有人随地吐痰就会受到劝告或批评。
    这里的卫生知识普及得也很好。从十岁到六十岁的人，都懂得了不少科学卫生知识，知道某些疾病是由什么细菌传染的，在什么季节最容易感染，怎样预防等。他们宣传卫生知识的方法是灵活多样的，党校、团校、民校和红专学校都增设了卫生课；召开社员大会，或是在看戏看电影，都要抽出前十分钟，宣传卫生知识；保健站还编了一本“卫生知识手册”，人人都有一本，随身携带，随时随地学习。
    太阳村的变化实在是太大了。而许多变化都是新近一年内发生的。无怪那位热情的管理区主任兴奋地说：人民公社给大办卫生事业创造了极有利的条件，工作也就更好作了，变化也就更大了。
