    Improve Technical Level, Consolidate Innovation Achievements
    Ten Thousand Tianjin Dockworkers Master New Machinery

    (Our newspaper Tianjin, 18th dispatch) To adapt to the new situation of mechanized and continuous loading and unloading in transportation departments and in-factory transportation in Tianjin, effective measures were taken to vigorously train technical workers in the use and maintenance of new machinery. By the end of February, more than 10,000 loading and unloading workers in the city had skillfully mastered new machinery, more than 3,000 workers had become all-rounders, and 740 people had become "native experts" in machinery manufacturing and design.

    Through two months of intensive effort, Tianjin's transportation departments and factory-run transportation manufactured more than 15,000 pieces of loading, unloading, and transportation equipment, such as large cranes, electric shovels, and conveyors. The level of mechanization and semi-mechanization increased from below 10% to over 80%, and all loading and unloading workers in the city were freed from heavy manual labor and manual operations. After a large number of new machines were manufactured, the work efficiency was not high and individual machines were damaged due to unskilled use. Faced with this new situation, the relevant leaders of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee strengthened the training of workers. Subsequently, Party committees at all levels, cargo yards, docks, specialized transportation departments, and factory enterprises established corresponding leading bodies to lead loading and unloading workers in launching a technical learning movement of "two understandings and three knowledges, one person with multiple skills," requiring everyone to be able to operate and repair machines, and to know the performance, structure, power knowledge, and operating procedures of the machines. In just over a month, the vast number of loading and unloading workers in Tianjin have learned basic electrical knowledge, the performance structure and operation of machines. The vast majority of workers have skillfully mastered one or two kinds of loading and unloading machines. One-third of the workers have become versatile operators of cranes, electric shovels, conveyors, battery cars, and other machines, as well as "native experts" in design and manufacturing. With the improvement of workers' technical level, the utilization rate of new machines has increased by about 30%, the perfect rate has increased from 75% in the early stage to 92%, and the handling efficiency has increased by 30% to 50%.

    The master-apprentice method, learning by doing, is an important method for Tianjin transportation departments and factory enterprises to train workers and improve technology at high speed. The Shao Gongzhuang Timber Factory originally had only six veteran masters. Each master taught two to four apprentices. After the apprentices learned, they taught other apprentices. In the past month, all 156 dockworkers in the factory have mastered the new machinery under the guidance of the masters.

    Tianjin's technical training work pays great attention to adhering to the principle of putting politics in command. Most of the workers in Tianjin Local Specialty Selection Factory No. 1 are female workers with a low level of education, and all operations used to be manual. After the workers manufactured trackless trams and earthen elevators, individual cadres believed that female workers could not quickly learn to operate these machines. After discovering this problem, the factory Party committee promptly held various forms of symposiums to criticize this conservative thinking. Subsequently, a mass movement of everyone learning technology and mastering new machines immediately formed a climax in the factory. In just over ten days, female workers generally learned to use new machines, and twenty-four people have learned to drive the more complex and difficult-to-drive trackless trams, meeting the needs of in-factory transportation.

    At present, after mastering the technology of using new machines, the vast number of loading and unloading workers in many cargo yards, factories, and docks in Tianjin are even more motivated. In the spirit of continuous revolution, they have launched a new upsurge of technical transformation of new machines. Many machines have been further improved on the original basis, with semi-mechanization developing towards mechanization, and mechanization developing towards continuous operation.

    While vigorously training technical workers, many factories, enterprises, and transportation departments have adopted the method of following the mass line, widely soliciting opinions from employees, and formulating safety operating procedures for new machines such as cranes, electric vehicles, locomotives, and conveyors through learning and practical operation, to ensure all operations and continuously improve the efficiency of machines. Some units have also formulated regulations for the storage and maintenance of new machines, so that new machines can be used reasonably and repaired in a timely manner to avoid waste and damage.

    提高技术水平　巩固革新成果
    天津万名搬运工人掌握新机具
    本报天津18日电　天津市交通运输部门和厂内运输方面，为了适应搬运装卸机械化、连续化的新形势，采取有效措施，大力培养新机具使用维修方面的技术工人。到2月底止，全市已有一万多名搬运装卸工人熟练地掌握了新机具，三千余名工人成了多面手，七百四十人成了机具制造、设计的“土专家”。
    天津市交通运输部门和厂办运输经过两个月的突击，制造了大型吊车、电铲、运送机等搬运装卸、运输机具一万五千多件，机械化和半机械化的水平由10％以下提高到80％以上，全市搬运装卸工人全部摆脱了笨重体力劳动和手工操作。大批新机具制造出来以后，由于使用技术不熟练，曾出现过工作效率不高和个别机具损坏的现象。面对这种新的形势，中共天津市委有关领导方面加强了对工人的培训工作。接着各区委、各货场、码头、专业运输部门、工厂企业层层成立了相应的领导机构，领导搬运装卸工人掀起了一个人人会操作，会修理，知道机具性能、结构、动力常识和操作规程的“两会三知，一人多艺”的学技术运动。仅仅一个多月，天津市广大搬运装卸工人已学会了普通电学知识，机具性能结构和操作使用，绝大多数工人已熟练地掌握了一种到二种搬运装卸机具，三分之一的工人已成了使用吊车、电铲、输送机、电瓶车等多面手和设计制造“土专家”。随着工人技术水平的提高，新机具的利用率提高了30％左右，完好率由初期的75％提高到92％，搬运效率提高了30％至50％。
    师傅带徒弟，边干边学，是天津交通运输部门、工厂企业高速度培养工人提高技术的一个重要方法。邵公庄木材厂原来只有六名老师傅，一个师傅带二至四个徒弟，徒弟学会后又带徒弟，一个月来，全厂一百五十六名搬运工人在师傅的带动下已全部掌握了新机具。
    天津市的技术培训工作，十分注意坚持政治挂帅，天津土特产品挑选一厂大部分是女工，文化水平较低，过去全部手工操作，在工人制造了无轨电车和土电梯后，个别干部认为女工不可能很快学会开动这些机器。厂党委发现这个问题后，及时召开各种形式的座谈会，批判了这种保守思想。接着一个人人学习技术，掌握新机具的群众运动立即在全厂形成高潮，十几天的时间女工们就普遍学会使用新机具，比较复杂又难驾驶的无轨电车已有二十四人学会驾驶，满足了厂内运输的需要。
    目前，天津市许多货场、工厂、码头的广大搬运装卸工人在掌握了使用新机具的技术以后，干劲更足。他们本着不断革命的精神，又掀起了一个对新机具进行技术改造的新高潮。许多机具在原来的基础上得到了进一步改进，半机械化向机械化发展，机械化又向连续化发展。
    许多工厂企业和交通运输部门在大力培训技术工人的同时，采取走群众路线的方法，广泛征求职工的意见，通过学习和实际操作进行总结，制订了吊车、电动车、机车、输送机等新机具的安全操作规程，以保证全部操作和不断提高机具的效率。还有的单位制订了新机具的保管、维修等制度，使新机具得到合理使用，及时维修，以避免浪费和损坏的现象。
