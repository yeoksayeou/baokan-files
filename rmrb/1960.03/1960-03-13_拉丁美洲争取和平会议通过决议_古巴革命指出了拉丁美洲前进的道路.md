Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 11th. The Latin American Conference for Peace, which opened on the 9th, victoriously concluded today in the Cuban capital after discussing and passing a series of resolutions on opposing imperialism, striving for national independence, and defending world peace.

	A general resolution passed by the conference extended warm congratulations to the Cuban Revolution, stating that the Cuban Revolution "realizes the liberation aspirations of the people of Latin American countries and points out the path forward for them."

	The resolution supported a plan for general and unconditional disarmament, emphasizing that the military bases imposed on Latin American countries seriously undermine their sovereignty and are a constant threat of war.

	The resolution condemned the current Pan-American treaties as limiting the sovereignty of the people of Latin American countries, using the pretext of defending the continent. The resolution condemned the Organization of American States as being controlled by imperialism, making it impossible to reasonably resolve the problems of Latin American countries.

	The conference resolution emphasized that although the current international situation has eased, war instigators are still stubbornly active. The establishment of new military bases in West Germany and Spain, the continuation of colonial wars, the revival of racial hatred and anti-Semitism, and the renewed persecution of peace advocates all prove this point. Therefore, the conference decided to strengthen efforts to block the path of war instigators.

	A letter to Cuban Prime Minister Castro passed by the conference emphasized that Cuba has already opened a decisive gap in the imperialist chains that oppress Latin America, which is to be congratulated. Cuba has made extensive contributions to the cause of world peace that we defend. After protesting the sabotage of the "La Coubre," the letter said, "We peace advocates are determined to do everything possible to promote increasingly broad and firm support for the Cuban Revolution from the governments and peoples of Latin American countries. We are convinced that one of the fundamental points of the struggle for peace and national sovereignty currently unfolding on our continent is to support the Cuban Revolution, which is an outstanding example and clear paradigm of this struggle."

	A statement passed by the conference on supporting the people of all countries fighting for national independence and freedom said that for Puerto Rico, British Guiana, French Guiana, Dutch Guiana, Belize (British Honduras), and some island nations in the Caribbean Sea under European and American rule, the time has come to get rid of colonial rule and fight for full rights. The statement said, "We express our support for the people of Dominica, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Haiti. Their struggle against the tyrants supported by imperialism, the enemy of our countries, is an active contribution to the great struggle for peace and national sovereignty in Latin America and the world." The statement also expressed active support for the people of African countries who are struggling to get rid of imperialist oppressors and the Algerian people who are waging a war of liberation.

	The conference also passed resolutions supporting the Panamanian people's struggle to restore sovereignty over the Canal and the Puerto Rican people's struggle for independence. The resolution pointed out that Puerto Rico, occupied by foreign masters, has been used as a barracks for preparing for war. The resolution demanded the release of Albizu Campos and other imprisoned Puerto Rican patriots.

	The conference also passed resolutions supporting the people of Spain and Portugal, opposing the persecution of political prisoners by the Franco and Salazar regimes, and other resolutions.

	In a letter to the Geneva Three-Nation Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Weapon Tests, the conference said that the conference represents the Latin American peace movement and demands the immediate stipulation of a final cessation of all nuclear weapon tests.

    古巴革命指出了拉丁美洲前进的道路
    和平人士决心竭尽全力支持古巴人民的斗争
    新华社哈瓦那11日电　9日开幕的拉丁美洲争取和平会议在讨论和通过一系列关于反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的决议后，今天在古巴首都胜利闭幕。
    大会通过的一项总决议向古巴革命表示热烈的祝贺，决议说，古巴革命“实现着拉丁美洲各国人民的解放愿望，并向他们指出前进的道路”。
    决议支持普遍和无条件裁军的计划，决议强调指出，强加于拉丁美洲各国的军事基地严重地损害了各国的主权，成为战争的经常威胁。
    决议谴责现行的泛美条约限制了拉丁美洲各国人民的主权，这些条约是保卫大陆的借口。决议谴责说，美洲国家组织受着帝国主义的控制，因此，它不可能合理地解决拉丁美洲各国的问题。
    大会决议强调指出，目前国际局势虽然有了缓和，但是战争挑拨者仍然顽固地进行活动，在西德和西班牙建立新的军事基地，继续进行殖民战争、复活种族仇视和排犹活动以及再度迫害和平拥护者，便证明了这一点。因此，会议决定加强努力，以堵塞战争挑拨者的道路。
    大会通过的致古巴总理卡斯特罗的一封信强调指出，古巴已经在压迫拉丁美洲的帝国主义锁链上打开了决定性的缺口，这是值得庆幸的。古巴为我们所保卫的世界和平的事业作出了广泛的贡献。这封信在抗议“勒库布尔号”的破坏事件以后说，我们和平人士决心要尽一切力量促使拉丁美洲各国政府和人民日益广泛和坚决地支持古巴革命。我们确信，今天在我们的大陆上展开的争取和平与民族主权的斗争的基本点之一就是支持古巴革命，古巴革命是这一斗争的杰出的榜样和鲜明的范例。
    大会通过的关于支援为争取民族独立和自由而斗争的各国人民的声明说，对波多黎各、英属圭亚那、法属圭亚那、荷属圭亚那、伯利兹（英属洪都拉斯）以及受欧洲的和美国统治的加勒比海的一些岛国来说，已经到了摆脱殖民统治和争取完全的权利的时刻了。声明说，我们表示支持多米尼加、巴拉圭、尼加拉瓜和海地人民。他们反对我们各国的敌人帝国主义所支持的暴君的斗争，是对拉丁美洲和世界争取和平和民族主权的伟大斗争的积极贡献。声明还表示积极支持为摆脱帝国主义压迫者而斗争的非洲各国人民和正在进行解放斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。
    会议还通过决议，支持巴拿马人民争取恢复运河主权的斗争，支持波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争。决议指出，由外国主子占领的波多黎各已被利用作为准备战争的兵营。决议要求释放阿耳维苏·坎波斯和其他被监禁的波多黎各爱国者。
    大会还通过了关于支持西班牙和葡萄牙人民、反对佛朗哥和萨拉查政权迫害政治犯的决议和其他一些决议。
    会议在致日内瓦三国不继续核武器试验会议的信中说，会议代表拉丁美洲和平运动要求立即规定最后停止一切核武器试验。
