Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th dispatch:
One of the leaders of the non-mainstream factions within Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, stated today that "how to handle the Security Treaty issue will be the key to breaking the deadlock in Japan-China [relations]."

Ishibashi made this statement during a meeting with Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and others. Iwai said at the time that some within the Liberal Democratic Party believed that the Japan-China issue could be resolved after the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was ratified. He pointed out that this would not break the deadlock in Japan-China relations. Ishibashi agreed with Iwai's view.

During the meeting, Iwai and other union leaders stated that they opposed the new "Security Treaty," which views China and the Soviet Union as enemies, and hoped that Ishibashi would find a way to dissolve the Diet. Ishibashi expressed complete opposition to the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and argued that the Diet should carefully debate the treaty. He stated that he would decide on his attitude toward dissolving the Diet after "looking at the situation further."

Ishibashi and Iwai agreed that a Japan-Soviet peace treaty should be concluded as soon as possible and that negotiations with the Soviet Union should begin immediately on this issue.

Meanwhile, within the Liberal Democratic Party, an increasing number of people are opposing Kishi Nobusuke's certain actions on the new "Security Treaty" issue, and they disagree with the Kishi Nobusuke group's interpretation of issues such as the scope of the new "Security Treaty" in the Far East. The Hayato Ikeda faction and the Matsumura-Miki faction members met on the 8th and stated that if the Kishi Nobusuke group puts pressure on non-mainstream factions because of this, they will resist.

According to Kyodo News, the Kishi Nobusuke group is plotting to suppress non-mainstream factions such as Ishibashi with "Party discipline." However, non-mainstream faction members stated that if Kishi Nobusuke suppresses Ishibashi in this way, they will defend Ishibashi.

    对于岸信介在日美条约问题上的做法
    日本执政党内不满者日增
    岸信介集团阴谋以“党纪”压制非当权派
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党内非当权派领袖之一、前首相石桥湛山今天说，“如何处理安全条约问题，将成为打开日中（关系僵局）的关键”。
    石桥是在同日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章等举行会谈时发表这个意见的。岩井当时说，自由民主党内有人认为可以在批准新日美“安全条约”之后再来解决日中问题。他指出，这样是不能打开日中关系僵局的。石桥表示同意岩井的看法。
    岩井章等工会领袖在会谈中说，他们反对以中苏为敌的新“安全条约”，并希望石桥设法解散国会。石桥表示完全反对国会批准新“安全条约”，并且主张国会应该仔细辩论这项条约。他表示要在“再看一看情况”后决定对解散国会的态度。
    石桥和岩井一致认为应该早日缔结日苏和约，并且立即就这个问题同苏联开始谈判。
    同时，在自由民主党内，反对岸信介在新“安全条约”问题上某些作法的人正越来越多，他们对岸信介集团关于新“安全条约”的远东范围等问题解释持有异议。池田勇人派和松村—三木派议员在8日开会，表示如果岸信介集团因此而对非当权派施加压力，他们就要抵抗。
    据共同社透露，岸信介集团正阴谋以“党纪”来压制石桥等非当权派。但是非当权派的议员表示，如果岸信介这样压制石桥，他们就要保卫石桥。
