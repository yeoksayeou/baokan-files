Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th. According to a report in "Pravda," the working people of Moscow have decided to provide obligatory collective assistance to the Akmolinsk Oblast of Kazakhstan. Fourteen districts of Moscow have decided to provide systematic assistance to the fourteen districts of Akmolinsk. One district provides fixed assistance to one district.

The purpose of this collective assistance is to provide full and comprehensive cooperation and support to the people of the Akmolinsk Oblast in their struggle to increase grain and meat production.

All the working people of Moscow have decided to participate in this obligatory assistance work. The Moscow City Party Committee has approved this patriotic initiative of the working people.

Over the past few years, the Akmolinsk Oblast has opened up a total of 3.6 million hectares of wasteland. The land reclamation work has changed the face of Akmolinsk. State farms and settlements have appeared in the former barren areas, and schools, hospitals, and theaters have been established.

Thanks to the help of the Party and the state, this oblast now produces one to one and a half times more grain than the entire Kazakh SSR produced before the reclamation.

The vast majority of workers on the state farms and members of the collective farms in this oblast are newly relocated, many of whom are from Moscow. Every year, tens of thousands of young people from Moscow come to this oblast to help harvest grain.

In order to accelerate the development of this oblast, the people of Moscow have decided to fully undertake the work of supporting and assisting this oblast.

    苏联莫斯科市人民对阿克摩林斯克州进行义务集体帮助
    新华社莫斯科13日电　据“真理报”报道，莫斯科劳动人民决定对哈萨克的阿克摩林斯克州进行义务集体帮助。莫斯科十四个区决定对阿克摩林斯克的十四个区进行系统的帮助。一个区固定帮助一个区。
    这种集体帮助的目的，在于对阿克摩林斯克州人民在增加粮食和肉类的斗争中，予以全力的、各方面的协作和支援。
    莫斯科市的全体劳动人民都决定参加这一义务帮助工作。莫斯科市党委已批准了劳动人民的这一爱国主义的创议。
    阿克摩林斯克州几年来共开了三百六十万公顷荒地。开荒工作改变了阿克摩林斯克的面貌，在过去的荒凉地带上出现了国营农场、居民点，建立了学校、医院和剧院。
    由于党和国家的帮助，这个州现在生产的粮食比开荒前全哈萨克生产的粮食还多一倍到一倍半。
    这个州绝大部分国营农场的工人和集体农庄庄员都是新迁来的，其中许多人就是从莫斯科来的，每年莫斯科有成千上万的青年来到这个州帮助收获谷物。
    为了加速这个州的发展，莫斯科市人民决定全部负担起支援和帮助这个州的工作。
