Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 25th: Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic said at a press conference today that in a letter to Adenauer, he suggested that each of the two Germanies send representatives to form a joint delegation on the German peace treaty to participate in the upcoming highest-level conference, and authorize the delegation to present the views of the two German governments on the German peace treaty at the highest-level conference.

The letter stated: "Considering that the two German governments have so far held different views on the necessity of concluding a peace treaty and the content of the treaty, the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the representatives of the two Germanies in the joint delegation on the German peace treaty should first try to seek a common position on the peace treaty issue. In order to start exchanging views on this issue as soon as possible, the government of the German Democratic Republic is ready to immediately appoint representatives to participate in the joint delegation on the German peace treaty. If the representatives of the two governments cannot reach a consensus, then the views on the issues still in dispute must be presented separately."

The letter pointed out that the issue of preparing to conclude a German peace treaty will occupy an important position at the highest-level conference, and the interests of the German people require the governments of the two Germanies and the governments of the Four Powers to finally take steps to promote the conclusion of peace with Germany.

The letter said that the conclusion of a peace treaty is of great national significance to the German people. It will eliminate the great obstacles facing the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany, and will practically prevent the outbreak of a third world war.

After reading the letter to Adenauer, Premier Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic is continuing to implement its policy of striving to ease international tensions, understanding and peace, and once again expresses to the world that it is willing to make every effort to conclude a German peace treaty as soon as possible.

Grotewohl said that ensuring the participation of the German people on an equal footing in the international negotiations on the German peace treaty is a common national responsibility of the two Germanies.

    格罗提渥总理写信给阿登纳
    建议两个德国政府合组代表团
    就对德和约问题交换意见并参加最高级会议
    新华社柏林25日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今天在记者招待会上说，他在写给阿登纳的一封信中，建议两个德国各派出代表，组成一个对德和约联合代表团去参加即将召开的最高级会议，并且授权这个代表团在最高级会议上就对德和约问题提出两个德国政府的意见。
    这封信说：“考虑到两个德国政府迄今对缔结和约的必要性以及和约的内容持有不同的看法，德意志民主共和国政府认为，在对德和约联合代表团中的两个德国的代表首先应当设法就和约问题谋求共同的立场。为了尽快开始就这个问题交换意见，德意志民主共和国政府准备立即指派代表参加对德和约联合代表团。如果两个政府的代表不可能达成一致的意见，那么，对于还在争论中的问题的观点就必须分别提出。”
    信中指出，准备缔结对德和约的问题将在最高级会议上占重要地位，德国人民的利益要求两个德国的政府和四大国政府终于采取促成同德国媾和的步骤。
    信中说，缔结和约对德国人民来说，具有全民族的重大意义。它将排除德国的和平和民主的统一所面临的巨大障碍，并将实际地阻止第三次世界大战的爆发。
    格罗提渥总理在宣读了给阿登纳的信件之后说，德意志民主共和国政府正在继续执行它的争取缓和国际局势、谅解与和平的政策，并再一次向全世界表示，它愿意为了尽快地缔结对德和约而尽一切努力。
    格罗提渥说，保证德国人民在平等的基础上参加关于对德和约的国际谈判，是两个德国共同的民族责任。
