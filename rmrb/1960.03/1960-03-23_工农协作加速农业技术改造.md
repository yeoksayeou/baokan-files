    Worker-Peasant Cooperation Accelerates Agricultural Technological Transformation

    The Profound Significance of "Counterpart Cooperation"
    On March 20th, the Shanxi Daily published news about the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory supporting the agricultural technological transformation of the Zhangqing Shuguang People's Commune. It introduced the great achievements made by the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory in helping the Shuguang Commune in repairing and assembling machinery, supplying agricultural tools, and training technical personnel over the past few years. They adopted a new form of factory assisting commune, with counterpart support. The Shanxi Daily published an editorial addressing this issue. The editorial pointed out: This kind of planned, organized, and led factory-commune counterpart cooperation has a more profound significance for promoting the growth of communist factors. We are Marxists who believe in continuous revolution and the stages of revolutionary development. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, for any new thing, we must not only see its practical significance for promoting socialist construction but also see every quantitative change from socialism to communism. A new type of worker-peasant exchange relationship has emerged in the counterpart cooperation between the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory and the Zhangqing Shuguang Commune. The factory produces certain mechanical equipment for the commune, undertakes part of the repair and assembly of tools, and undertakes the task of training technicians; the commune assists the factory in building a non-staple food production base. This is an exchange. But this exchange relationship is different from general exchange relationships. The products exchanged by both parties are the unpaid labor contributed by workers and peasants, the creation of workers' two hours of voluntary labor per week, the funds and materials saved by workers' creative labor, and the things produced by commune members during their rest time. Therefore, this exchange relationship also has the budding of communism. At the same time, because the factory wants to train technicians for the commune, commune members will go to the factory in batches to work, study, and receive training from the working class. When they have completed their studies, they will become workers themselves. Factory-commune counterpart cooperation also links the small-scale industries operated by the commune and the large-scale industrial production of the factory, forming a more complete industrial system; the small farms operating non-staple food production by the factory and the large agriculture of the commune are linked together, forming a more complete agricultural system. The two are intertwined and permeate each other both within the industrial sector and within the agricultural sector, which has far-reaching significance for eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants. In the current stage of socialism, the largest and most basic exchange relationship in the entire society is still the exchange of equal value, and the distribution system is basically distribution according to labor. The disappearance of the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas still requires a considerable period of time. This is certain. However, due to the development of social productive forces and the increasing level of awareness of the revolutionary masses, certain elements of communism will inevitably occur and develop in our practice of socialist construction. Although it is not yet large-scale or perfect, it has strong vitality. How to see the mainstream of this new thing of factory-commune counterpart cooperation and support its healthy development and growth is a political task for us.

    Small and Medium-Sized Industries Should Vigorously Support the Technological Transformation of Agriculture
    Industrial actively supporting agriculture and accelerating the realization of the technological transformation of agriculture is the glorious task of the working class in our country to further consolidate and develop the worker-peasant alliance under new historical conditions.
    Some people believe that supporting the technological transformation of agriculture is a matter for large-scale industries, and small and medium-sized industries cannot do anything major. This view is one-sided. Supporting the technological transformation of agriculture is the glorious task of the entire working class, and all enterprises, regardless of size, must contribute their share. Large-scale industries can produce large-scale agricultural machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters, as well as power, fertilizers, electricity, etc., which play a decisive role in realizing the technological transformation of agriculture. Large-scale enterprises are the main force in realizing the technological transformation of agriculture. However, the technological transformation of agriculture is carried out gradually, and it is guided by the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. Not only must large-scale agricultural equipment be used, but also tools and farm implements must be actively reformed. In this regard, small and medium-sized industries shoulder the main task, especially in manufacturing general power equipment, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved farm implements for agriculture. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the local army for realizing the technological transformation of agriculture. Therefore, large, medium, and small enterprises must fully tap their potential and vigorously support agriculture in all aspects according to actual possibilities.
    Some people believe that to quickly realize the technological transformation of agriculture, it is necessary to build new agricultural machinery, power, fertilizer, and electric power industrial sectors, and it is not possible to rely on existing enterprises. This view is also one-sided. We must transfer agriculture from its current backward technical foundation to a modern foundation within a few years, first realize the mechanization and water conservancy of agriculture, greatly increase the labor productivity of agriculture, and make agricultural production grow exponentially, so that it is possible to gradually extract labor and further develop industry. This task is very arduous. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to actively build and strengthen new industrial sectors related to the technological transformation of agriculture under the unified plan of the state. On the other hand, it is necessary to rely on and tap the potential of existing large, medium, and small enterprises, and produce products that directly serve agriculture according to needs and possibilities. This aspect is absolutely indispensable, and there is great potential.
    Realizing the technological transformation of agriculture is an arduous task. The strength of factories and enterprises must be combined with the strength of the people's commune industry to play a greater role. While factories and enterprises actively support agriculture, the people's communes should also actively exert the strength of the existing commune-run industries and actively run some small machinery factories, fertilizer factories, power plants, etc., that directly serve agriculture, providing agriculture with improved farm tools, fertilizers, electricity, and close collaboration and cooperation with large-scale industries, promoting each other, thereby accelerating the process of agricultural technological transformation from small to large and from low to high.

### 工农协作加速农业技术改造

    工农协作加速农业技术改造
    “对口协作”的深远意义
    3月20日山西日报发表了经纬纺织机械厂支援张庆曙光人民公社农业技术改造的新闻。介绍了几年来经纬纺织机械厂帮助曙光公社在修配机械，供应农具，以及培训技术人才方面所取得的巨大成绩。他们采取了工厂包公社，对口支援的新形式，山西日报针对这个问题发表了社论。社论指出：这种有规划、有组织、有领导的厂社对口协作，对于促进共产主义因素的增长，有着更加深远的意义。我们是马克思主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论者。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，对于任何新生事物，都是既看到它对于促进社会主义建设事业的现实意义，也要看到由社会主义过渡到共产主义的每个量的变化。经纬纺织机械厂和张庆曙光公社在对口协作中，出现了一种新的工农交换关系。工厂为公社生产某些机械设备，承担部分修配、安装工具，担任培训技工的任务；公社协助工厂建设副食品生产基地，这是一种交换。但这种交换关系不同于一般的交换关系。双方所交换的产品是工人和农民贡献出的不要报酬的劳动，是工人每周义务劳动两小时的创造，是工人们创造性的劳动所节约的资金和材料，是公社社员用休息时间所生产出来的东西。因而，这种交换关系也带有共产主义的萌芽。同时，由于工厂要给公社培训技工，公社社员将分批地到工厂去劳动，去学习，去受工人阶级的训练，当他们学业完成之后，自己也就变成了工人。厂社对口协作，还使公社经营的小型工业和工厂的大工业生产联结起来，组成了较为完善的工业体系；工厂经营的生产副食品的小农场和公社的大农业联结起来，组成了较为完善的农业体系。二者既在工业部门内部，又在农业部门内部，互相交错，互相渗透，这对消除城乡差别，工农差别，具有深远的意义。在社会主义的现阶段，整个社会的交换关系，最大量的、最基本的仍然是等价交换，分配制度基本上是按劳分配，工农差别、城乡差别的消失，仍须经过一个相当长的过程，这是肯定的。但由于社会生产力的发展，由于革命群众觉悟程度的日益提高，在我们社会主义建设的实践中，共产主义的某些因素，也必然要发生和发展。虽然它暂时还不是大量的，不是完善的，然而它有旺盛的生命力，对于厂社对口协作这一新生事物，如何看到它的主流，扶植它健康地发展、壮大，是我们的一项政治任务。
    中小型工业要大力支援农业的技术改造
    工业积极支援农业，加速实现农业的技术改造，这是我国工人阶级在新的历史条件下，进一步巩固和发展工农联盟的光荣任务。
    有人认为，支援农业技术改造是大工业的事情，中小型工业做不了什么大事。这种看法是片面的。支援农业技术改造是全体工人阶级的光荣任务，无论大中小型企业都要尽上自己的一份力量。大工业能够生产拖拉机和联合收割机等大型农业机械设备和动力、化肥、电力等，对实现农业技术改造起着决定作用。大型企业是实现农业技术改造的主力军。但是，农业技术改造是逐步进行的，而且是贯彻土洋并举的方针，既要采用大型农业设备，又要积极改革工具、改良农具。在这方面，中小型工业担负着主要的任务。特别是为农业制造一般动力设备、化肥、农药，以及制造改良农具等，中小型企业是实现农业技术改造的地方军。所以，大型和中小型企业都要充分挖掘潜力，根据实际可能，从各方面大力支援农业。
    有人认为，要迅速实现农业技术改造，必须新建农业机械、动力、化肥和电力工业部门，靠现有企业是不行的。这种看法也是片面的。我们要在若干年时间内，把农业从目前的落后的技术基础上，转移到现代化的基础上来，首先实现农业的机械化、水利化，大大提高农业的劳动生产率，使农业生产成倍地增长起来，这才有可能逐步抽出劳动力，进一步发展工业。这个任务是十分繁重的。所以一方面要在国家的统一计划下，积极建设和加强有关农业技术改造的新的工业部门。另一方面，必须依靠和挖掘现有大中小型企业的潜力，根据需要和可能，生产直接为农业服务的产品，这方面是绝对不可缺少的，而且潜力很大。
    实现农业技术改造是一项艰巨的任务，工厂企业的力量要和人民公社工业的力量结合起来，才能发挥更大的作用。在工厂企业积极支援农业的同时，人民公社也应当积极发挥现有社办工业的力量，并且积极举办一些直接为农业服务的小型机械厂、肥料厂、发电厂等等，为农业提供改良农具、化肥、电力、和大工业密切协作和配合，互相推动，从而从小到大、由低到高地加速农业技术改造的进程。
