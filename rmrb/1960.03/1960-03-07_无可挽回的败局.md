Having left with trepidation and returned with fear and trembling, the American president has ended his South American tour after more than ten days of extreme nervous tension. Eisenhower originally had high hopes for his visit to South America. In his speech to the American public on the eve of his departure, he said with confidence: "I deeply hope that when I return, I will be able to report to you that the historic friendship and trust between the countries of this hemisphere has been strengthened, and our common cause—peace in justice and freedom—has been reaffirmed and given new life." But after the visit, he solemnly announced that in Latin America "a most resolute campaign must be launched to eliminate ignorance and correct misunderstandings." That is to say, even Eisenhower himself admitted that his visit was a failure.

Two years ago, U.S. Vice President Nixon tasted tomatoes, eggs, and fists in South America, and ended up fleeing in disgrace. Eisenhower's experience this time was, it should be said, even more undignified than that of his deputy. Because: First, Eisenhower did a lot of work before he set off. He tried his best to dress himself up as a messenger of "peace and goodwill." The American propaganda machine also desperately touted that his visit marked the "beginning of a vigorous effort by the United States to improve relations with Latin America as a whole." Second, Eisenhower this time went to four countries that were carefully selected and considered relatively "safe." Before his departure, American newspapers asserted: "President Eisenhower is unlikely to encounter such 'unfriendly expressions' as Vice President Nixon encountered when he visits South America" ("New York Times"). "Eisenhower will receive a particularly warm reception in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile because these countries 'have few differences with Washington'" ("Washington Post"). Third, Eisenhower's visit this time adopted extraordinary security measures, as if he were penetrating deep into enemy territory. The United States dispatched a large number of aircraft, warships, and troops to escort him. In Rio de Janeiro alone, 400 American secret police were sent two months in advance to make arrangements. On the eve of the American president's arrival, representatives of the American secret police even arrogantly demanded to search the Brazilian presidential palace. In order to protect Eisenhower's personal safety, the local governments concentrated the largest number of military and police personnel. For example, in Uruguay, more than three-quarters of the national armed forces were mobilized, including cavalry, light and heavy tanks, and military vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, and light field guns, to maintain vigilance. According to reports, the security precautions taken at the American embassy where he spent the night were so strict that the White House had never experienced them before. Police and soldiers surrounded the entire area with armored vehicles, firefighters stood guard with water hoses to deal with "riots," and police dogs patrolled the nearby park areas. All of this was not available during Nixon's trip to South America two years ago.

However, all this could not suppress the Latin American people's indignant emotions towards this representative of the Wall Street monopoly capitalist groups and colonialists. When Eisenhower passed through Puerto Rico, the people there used loud slogans such as "We demand independence," "The United States is oppression," and "Let us get rid of colonialism" to "greet" him. A banner hung high on a main street in the Brazilian capital read: "Understand, never give in." The Brazilian Student Union warned in an open letter to Eisenhower: "We cannot allow the dark history of the invasion of Guatemala to be replayed in Latin American life. Any intervention in Cuba will be regarded as an aggression against the entire Latin America." People in the Argentine capital constantly held demonstrations, and the police's tear gas could not disperse the crowd. Eisenhower had to enter the city by helicopter, but angry crowds waved their fists and shouted at the helicopter: "Eisenhower go home!" "Yankees are the scourge of Latin America." In Santiago, the capital of Chile, Eisenhower was "welcomed" by demonstrators shouting "Yankees go home, return our copper" and anti-American leaflets flying all over the streets like snowflakes. The Uruguayan people held three demonstrations within three hours of Eisenhower's arrival. Violent clashes broke out between police and demonstrators on the streets, and tear gas made Eisenhower's eyes water. He almost got hit by a tar bomb. This "goodwill ambassador" finally boarded a helicopter in a hurry under strict guard with soldiers standing guard every ten feet and slipped away.

Eisenhower's extraordinary encounter was entirely self-inflicted. The purpose of Eisenhower's trip was to try to use sweet words and the jingle of gold coins in his pocket to confuse people, so as to ease the anti-American wave in Latin America, strengthen American control over Latin America, and curb the process of the Latin American national democratic movement. He boasted everywhere that American capital had made "important contributions" to the "prosperity" of Latin American countries, boasted that American "aid" had "accelerated (the development of Latin American countries)," and denied that American capital had "destroyed the Latin American economy to make itself rich." It would be better not to mention America's investment and "aid" to Latin America. Mentioning it would only arouse more resentment and indignation among the Latin American people.

For many years, American monopoly groups have used means such as investment and "aid" to control the economic lifelines of Latin American countries, including 90% of Chile's copper, 90% of Venezuela's oil, 80% of Mexico's mining industry, and almost all of Central America's fruit production, and have made each country a supplier of American single raw materials. The United States currently has $13 billion invested in Latin America. The United States seizes $4 billion in profits from Latin America every year, equivalent to the total investment of Latin American countries for twelve years. In order to ensure its insatiable exploitation of Latin American countries, the United States wantonly undermines the sovereignty of these countries and places them firmly under its control politically and militarily. Due to the long-term and cruel plundering by the United States, the people of Latin American countries have fallen into extremely poverty and backward conditions. Eisenhower talked a lot about the "contributions" of American "aid" and investment to Brazil in Brazil, and expressed "pride" in this "contribution." In fact, the deepening plunder of American monopoly capital has seriously damaged the development of Brazil's national economy, causing Brazil's deepening economic difficulties and dependence on the United States. The direct investment of the United States in Brazil has reached more than 1.65 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for more than 60% of Brazil's total foreign direct investment. American capital controls Brazil's important economic sectors such as electricity, gas, telephone, manganese mining, meat packaging, oil distribution, and raw material exports. The annual profit of American investment is as high as 500%. Brazil's foreign trade had a surplus in 1958, but due to the outflow of profits from foreign capital, it lost 300 million U.S. dollars. Eisenhower also described the American "aid" and investment to Argentina as the "most powerful financial cooperation plan" that the United States has implemented in the Western Hemisphere "in history," and as an "outstanding example of truly effective cooperation." But, in fact, the "stable economic plan" imposed by the United States on Argentina is an "outstanding example" of the United States' clever plundering and self-interest at the expense of Latin American people. At the end of 1958, Argentina obtained a loan of 1 billion U.S. dollars according to this plan, and was also forced to accept a large number of conditions that damaged national interests. As a result, industrial production shrank step by step, agricultural production also dropped sharply, the currency depreciated sharply, and prices rose in a straight line. By the end of last year, the Argentine government's budget deficit had reached 38.5 billion pesos, an increase of 167.4% compared with December of the previous year. On the other hand, American monopoly capital stole Argentina's important oil resources. Nine American oil companies and several other British and Dutch oil companies obtained more than 7 million hectares of oil concessions. At the same time, the oil price increase implemented in accordance with the "stable economic plan" allowed American monopoly capital and its partners to seize a huge profit of 50 billion pesos from this item alone. Needless to say, the United States' plunder of the other two countries is no worse than that of Brazil and Argentina. Eisenhower boasted about the "favors" of American "aid" and loans in South America. Did he really treat the South American people as idiots?

The people of Latin American countries know better than anyone else that the predatory and enslavement policies of U.S. imperialism are the root of their suffering. The public opinion of many countries has strongly exposed and denounced the criminal acts of the United States in invading Latin America. The Brazilian newspaper "New Direction" pointed out: "As long as the United States is still under the control of monopoly capitalist groups, the United States' policy toward other countries, especially toward underdeveloped countries like Brazil, can only be aimed at domination and plunder." The newspaper also asked:
"Since American trusts plunder Brazilian wealth, force down the prices of Brazilian export products, and cause the Brazilian currency to depreciate sharply, and the International Monetary Fund forces Brazil to pursue policies that restrict economic development, how can it be forced to demand that the Brazilian people maintain friendship with the United States? How can Brazil believe that the U.S. government has good intentions when the U.S. Ambassador Cabot openly interferes in Brazil's internal affairs, attacks the nationalist movement, and tries to defend the plunder of the trusts?" The Chilean newspaper "Century" pointed out more clearly: "Increasing 'American aid' only means that imperialism is intensifying its control and exploitation of our countries." The Cuban newspaper "National Daily" also pointed out: "The so-called 'aid' provided by the United States is not for the benefit of all American countries, but for Wall Street itself." This newspaper is right. The Latin American people have seen how quickly Cuba can advance its cause without "American aid." The fact is that the Cuban people have shown with a convincing example that if Latin American countries want to change their backward conditions and seek the development and prosperity of their national economy, they must not rely on the "favors" of the United States; on the contrary, they must resolutely rise up and get rid of the shackles imposed on them by the United States. This obvious truth cannot be covered up by any deceptive means of Eisenhower.

The harsh facts of Latin America show the world that the United States' so-called aid to underdeveloped countries only means plundering and oppression of these countries, and only means disaster for these countries.

Eisenhower's trip to South America is related to the huge conspiracy being brewed by the United States to strangle the Cuban revolution. The U.S. ruling clique has used various means of interference, whether subversion, economic threats, or military intimidation, but has not been able to make the tenacious Cuban people submit. Now, only armed aggression remains. However, the Washington authorities are still hesitant to take this last step. They believe that first of all, they must alienate the people of other Latin American countries from the Cuban people and isolate Cuba. This is also a major task that Eisenhower performed on this trip to South America. On the one hand, he wanted to use the "big stick" to intimidate other Latin American countries from following the Cuban road and build a so-called "epidemic prevention line"; on the other hand, he also wanted to use deceptive means to trick some countries into supporting the United States' policy of interference in Cuba. Although Eisenhower tried his best to conceal his actions, it was still revealed that he had raised the conspiracy to interfere in the Cuban revolution in talks with Brazil and other countries. Eisenhower's remarks in the Brazilian Congress even fully exposed the United States' ambitions to interfere in Cuba and even other countries' internal affairs. He said: "If any country, whether by invasion, coercion, or subversion, does not allow the people of any of our sister republics to have the freedom of choice, we will consider this as interference in the internal affairs of an American country." Even the American propaganda machine does not deny that Eisenhower's remarks are an "extension of the Monroe Doctrine." The people of Latin America have a deep memory of the "Monroe Doctrine." The American Secretary of State Olney in the late nineteenth century once explained: "Today the United States actually rules (the American) continent, and all the people under its jurisdiction should regard its orders as laws and regulations." The United States once turned the Americas into the Americas of the United States based on the "Monroe Doctrine" and imposed control and interference on American countries. The "new Monroe Doctrine" announced by Eisenhower now is nothing more than an attempt to re-establish the United States' hegemony in Latin America. If the people of Latin American countries rise up to fight for independence and democracy and get rid of the control and rule of the United States, the United States can use the excuse of external "invasion, coercion, or subversion" to interfere. The British "Guardian" very rudely exposed: Eisenhower's remarks "seem to be a remake of the declaration made by Mr. Dulles at the Pan-American Conference in Caracas in 1954 on the eve of overthrowing a Guatemalan government that was considered to be influenced by communism." Obviously, Eisenhower laid the groundwork for the United States to openly launch an armed attack on Cuba. When Eisenhower was visiting South America, American planes continued to barbarously bomb Cuba, and recently there was a crime of foreign criminals and counter-revolutionaries manufacturing munitions explosions in Havana Harbor. These are not accidental.

However, Eisenhower made a wrong assessment of the situation in Latin America. Today, the situation in Latin America is far more unfavorable to U.S. imperialism than Eisenhower thought. The victory of the Cuban revolution opened the windows of Latin America, letting the sunlight shine into this continent and awakening the people of all countries. A magnificent national democratic revolutionary movement has surged like a tide on the entire Latin American continent. Whether it is the anti-dictatorship struggle in countries such as Dominica, the patriotic struggle of the Panamanian people to demand the return of lost land, the struggle of the Puerto Rican people to fight for independence, or the struggle of the people of other countries to safeguard national interests and fight for democracy, they have merged into a huge wave against American colonialism, powerfully impacting the colonial positions of U.S. imperialism. The people of Latin American countries are increasingly aware that U.S. imperialism is their common enemy, and the interests of U.S. imperialism are incompatible with their interests. They echo and support each other in the struggle. Their strong will to get rid of American control, plunder, enslavement, and rule cannot be shaken by any force or conspiracy. As the Washington "Star Evening Post" recently said, "The era when the United States controlled the hemisphere is over." Today's Latin America is not only not the Latin America of more than 100 years ago, but also not the Latin America of six years ago when the Guatemalan government was overthrown. The defeat of the United States in Latin America is irreversible. Therefore, Eisenhower's trip to South America was not only in vain, but also further aroused a new upsurge in the anti-American tide of the Latin American people. Since Eisenhower has used his own words and deeds to show that the United States has no intention of changing its policy of aggression against Latin America and still attempts to block the historical wheels of Latin America from moving forward, then what awaits U.S. imperialism will certainly not be just losing face.

    无可挽回的败局
    敏子
    提心吊胆而去，胆战心惊而回，美国总统在度过神经极度紧张的十多天之后已经结束了他的南美之行了。艾森豪威尔对于他自己这一次到南美的访问本来是抱有很大希望的，他在启程前夕对美国公众发表的演说中就曾经满怀信心地说：“我深深希望，我回来时能够向你们报告说：本半球各国之间的具有历史意义的友谊和信任已经得到加强，我们的共同事业——正义和自由中的和平——已经得到重申和新的生命。”但是在结束了访问之后，他郑重其事地宣布，在拉丁美洲“还必须展开一个最坚决的运动来消除无知和纠正误解”。这就是说，连艾森豪威尔自己也承认他的这次访问失败了。
    两年前美国的副总统尼克松在南美曾经饱尝了西红柿、鸡蛋和拳头，结果是抱头而窜。艾森豪威尔这一次的遭遇，应该说要比他的副手更加不体面些。因为：第一、艾森豪威尔在动身之前就做了不少工作。他竭力把自己打扮成为“和平亲善”的使者。美国的宣传机器也拼命鼓吹他这次访问标志着美国“大力争取改善同拉丁美洲整个关系的努力的开端”。第二、艾森豪威尔这一次所去的是经过慎重挑选认为是比较“安全”的四个国家。在他出发之前，美国的报刊就断言：“艾森豪威尔总统在访问南美的时候不大可能遇到像副总统尼克松曾遭遇到那样‘不友好的表现’”（“纽约时报”）。“艾森豪威尔在阿根廷、乌拉圭和智利将受到特别热诚的接待，因为这些国家‘同华盛顿很少分歧’”（“华盛顿邮报”）。第三、艾森豪威尔这次访问采取了异乎寻常的保安措施，有如深入敌阵。美国出动大批飞机、军舰和军队保驾，只是里约热内卢一处，早在两个月以前，就派了四百名美国秘密警察前往布置。而当美国总统到达的前夕，美国秘密警察的代表甚至蛮横地要搜查巴西总统府。为了保护艾森豪威尔的个人安全，各当地政府更是集中了最大数量的军警人员。例如在乌拉圭就调动了全国四分之三以上的武装部队，其中包括骑兵、轻重坦克、配备着重机枪、火箭炮和轻型野战炮的军用车进行警戒。据报道，在他过夜的美国大使馆，所采取的保安预防措施的严密，为白宫所从来没有经历过的，警察和士兵用装甲车辆把整个地区围了起来，消防员手执对付“骚乱”的水龙头戒备着，警犬在附近的公园地区巡游。所有这些，都是两年前尼克松南美之行未曾有过的。
    可是，所有这一切并没有能够压得住拉丁美洲人民对于这位华尔街垄断资本集团和殖民主义者的代表所表示的激愤情绪。当艾森豪威尔路过波多黎各的时候，那里的人民就用“我们要求独立”、“美国就是压迫”、“让我们摆脱殖民主义”的响亮口号来“迎接”他。巴西首都大街上高悬着横幅标语：“要了解，决不屈服”。巴西学生联合会在致艾森豪威尔的公开信中发出警告：“不能允许在拉丁美洲的生活中重演侵略危地马拉的黑暗历史，对古巴的任何干涉，将被认为是对整个拉丁美洲的侵略”。阿根廷首都的人民不断地举行示威，警察的催泪弹也驱散不了人群，艾森豪威尔只好坐直升飞机入城，可是愤怒的群众挥舞拳头，对着直升飞机高呼：“艾森豪威尔滚回去！”“美国佬是拉丁美洲的祸根”。在智利首都圣地亚哥，“欢迎”艾森豪威尔的是示威者高呼“美国佬滚回去，还我们铜来”和反美传单雪片似地满街飞。乌拉圭人民在艾森豪威尔到达的三小时内，就举行了三次示威。街头上警察和示威群众发生了剧烈的冲突，催泪弹弄得艾森豪威尔也眼泪直淌。他还差一点挨到一颗沥青弹。这位“亲善使者”最后在每十英尺就有兵士站着警卫的严密警戒下，仓皇登上直升飞机溜走了。
    艾森豪威尔这次不平凡的遭遇，完全是自作自受。艾森豪威尔此行的目的，是想凭着一口甜言蜜语和口袋中叮当发响的金元来迷惑人心，以缓和拉丁美洲的反美浪潮，加强美国对拉丁美洲的控制，遏止拉丁美洲民族民主运动的进程。他到处吹嘘美国资本对拉丁美洲国家的“繁荣”作出了“重要贡献”，吹嘘美国的“援助”“加速了（拉丁美洲各国的）发展”，否认美国资本“摧毁拉丁美洲经济以使自己发财”。关于美国对拉丁美洲的投资和“援助”，不提还好，提起来只能更加激起拉丁美洲人民的怨恨和忿懑。
    许多年以来，美国垄断集团通过投资和“援助”等手段，控制了拉丁美洲各国的经济命脉，包括智利90％的铜、委内瑞拉90％的石油、墨西哥80％的采矿业和几乎全部中美洲的果品生产，并且使每个国家都成为提供美国单一种原料的供应地。美国目前投在拉丁美洲的资金已达一百三十亿美元。美国每一年从拉丁美洲夺去了四十亿美元的利润，相当于拉丁美洲各国十二年的投资总额。为了保证它对拉丁美洲各国贪得无厌的剥削，美国肆意破坏这些国家的主权，在政治和军事上把它们牢牢地置于它的控制之下。由于遭受美国长期的残酷掠夺，拉丁美洲各国人民陷于极其贫困和落后的状况。艾森豪威尔在巴西大谈美国对巴西的“援助”和投资的“贡献”，并对这种“贡献”表示“自豪”。事实上，美国垄断资本掠夺的不断加深，严重地破坏了巴西民族经济的发展，造成巴西的日益加深的经济困难和对美国的依赖。美国在巴西的直接投资已达到十六亿五千万美元以上，占巴西全部外国直接投资的60％还多。美国资本控制了巴西的电力、煤气、电话、锰矿开采、肉类包装、石油分配以及原料出口等重要经济部门。美国投资每年的利润高达500％。巴西1958年对外贸易本来有盈余，但是由于外国资本的利润外流反而亏空三亿美元。艾森豪威尔还把美国对阿根廷的“援助”和投资说成是美国在西半球“历史上所执行过的最有力的财政合作计划”，是“真正有效的合作计划的出色例子”。但是，事实上，美国强加予阿根廷的“稳定经济计划”，正是美国对拉丁美洲人民巧取豪夺、损人利己的“出色例子”。1958年底，阿根廷根据这个计划，得到了十亿美元的贷款，同时也被迫接受了一大堆损害民族利益的条件，结果是弄得工业生产步步萎缩，农业生产也大大下降，币值一落千丈，物价直线上升。到去年年底，阿根廷政府的预算赤字已达到三百八十五亿比索，比前年12月增加了167．4％。另一方面，美国垄断资本窃取了阿根廷的重要的石油资源，九家美国石油公司和另外几家英荷等石油公司取得了七百多万公顷石油租让地。同时按照“稳定经济计划”而实行的石油提价，使美国垄断资本和它的伙伴仅从这一项就攫取了五十亿比索的巨额利润。不用说，美国对另外两个国家的掠夺，也丝毫不比巴西和阿根廷差些。艾森豪威尔在南美夸耀美国的“援助”和贷款的“恩惠”，难道真是把南美人民都当成了白痴？
    拉丁美洲各国人民比谁都更加清楚，美帝国主义的掠夺和奴役政策是他们痛苦的根源。许多国家的舆论都纷纷有力地揭穿和斥责美国侵略拉丁美洲的罪恶行径。巴西的“新方针”报指出：“只要美国仍然在垄断资本集团控制之下，美国对其它国家的政策，特别是对像巴西这样的不发达国家的政策，只能是以统治和掠夺为目的。”这家报纸并且问道：
  “既然美国托辣斯掠夺巴西财富，强迫降低巴西出口产品的价格，引起巴西货币急剧贬值，国际货币基金组织又迫使巴西奉行限制经济发展的政策，怎么可能强求巴西人民同美国保持友好呢？美国大使卡伯特公然干涉巴西内政，攻击民族主义运动，并竭力为托辣斯的掠夺辩护，巴西怎么能相信美国政府心怀善意呢？”智利的“世纪报”更明白地指出：“增加‘美援’只意味着帝国主义加紧对我们这些国家的控制和剥削。”古巴的“国民日报”也指出：“美国进行的所谓‘援助’不是为了所有美洲国家的利益，而是为华尔街自己。”这家报纸说得对，拉丁美洲人民已经看到，古巴没有“美援”的情况下能够以怎样的速度把自己事业向前推进。事实正是这样，古巴人民已经以令人信服的范例显示了拉丁美洲国家要想改变落后状况、谋求民族经济的发展和繁荣，决不能依靠美国的“恩惠”；相反的，必须坚决地起来摆脱美国强加在它们身上的枷锁。这个明显的真理，是艾森豪威尔用任何欺骗手段也无法遮盖得住的。
    拉丁美洲的严酷的事实向全世界表明，美国的所谓援助不发达国家，仅仅意味着对这些国家的掠夺和压榨，仅仅意味着这些国家的灾难。
    艾森豪威尔南美之行，同美国最近以来酝酿中的扼杀古巴革命的巨大阴谋有关。美国统治集团曾经使用过各种各样的干涉手段，不论颠覆阴谋、经济威胁直到军事恫吓，都没有能使顽强的古巴人民屈服，现在只剩下武装进攻一途了。然而华盛顿当局对于采取这最后一着还有所顾忌。他们认为首先必须离间拉丁美洲其他国家人民同古巴人民的关系，把古巴孤立起来。这也是艾森豪威尔这次到南美去执行的一个主要任务。他一面想用“大棒”威吓拉丁美洲其他国家不要走古巴的道路，建立起一道所谓“防疫线”；另一面还想用欺骗手段来骗取一些国家对美国干涉古巴政策的支持。尽管艾森豪威尔竭力掩盖自己的行径，但是他曾经在同巴西等国会谈中提出干涉古巴革命的阴谋，还是被透露出来了。艾森豪威尔在巴西国会中的一席话，更是充分暴露了美国为干涉古巴以至其他国家内政的野心。他说：“如果任何国家不管是用入侵、逼迫还是颠覆的办法不让我们的任何姊妹共和国的人民有选择的自由的话，我们将认为这是干涉一个美洲国家的内政”。艾森豪威尔的这番话，连美国宣传机器也不讳言是“门罗主义的延伸”。对于“门罗主义”，拉丁美洲人民是有着深刻的记忆的。十九世纪后期的美国国务卿奥尔奈曾经作过解释说：“今天美国实际上统治着（美洲）这个大陆，凡是它所管辖的老百姓应把它的命令视为法纪”。美国曾经根据“门罗主义”把美洲变成为美国的美洲，对美洲各国横加控制和干涉。艾森豪威尔现在宣布的“新门罗主义”，无非是要想重新确立美国在拉丁美洲的霸权。如果拉丁美洲人民起而争取独立和民主，摆脱美国的控制和统治，美国便可以以外来“入侵、逼迫或颠覆”的借口来加以干涉。英国的“卫报”就很不客气地揭露：艾森豪威尔这番话“看来像是杜勒斯先生1954年在推翻一个据认为是受共产党影响的危地马拉政府的前夕，在加拉加斯的泛美会议上提出的宣言的改头换面。”显然，艾森豪威尔是为美国公开对古巴发动武装进攻伏了一笔。当艾森豪威尔在南美访问的时候，美国飞机继续不断对古巴进行野蛮轰炸，最近还发生了外国罪犯和反革命分子在哈瓦那港制造军火爆炸的罪行，这都不是偶然的。
    但是，艾森豪威尔对于拉丁美洲的形势作了错误的估计。今天拉丁美洲的形势远比艾森豪威尔所认为的更不利于美帝国主义。古巴革命的胜利打开了拉丁美洲的窗户，让阳光射进了这个大陆，唤醒了各国的人民。一个气势磅礴的民族民主革命运动已经像潮水一般地汹涌澎湃地在整个拉丁美洲大陆展开了。不论是多米尼加等国的反独裁斗争也好，巴拿马人民要求收回失地的爱国斗争也好，波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争也好，其他国家的人民维护民族利益和争取民主的斗争也好，已经汇合成为一股反对美国殖民主义的巨浪，有力地冲击着美帝国主义的殖民阵地。拉丁美洲各国人民越来越清楚地认识到：美帝国主义是他们的共同敌人，美帝国主义的利益同他们的利益是水火不相容的。他们在斗争中互相呼应，互相支援。他们要求摆脱美国控制、掠夺、奴役和统治的坚强意志是任何力量和阴谋都不能动摇的。正如华盛顿“明星晚报”最近所说的，“由美国掌管半球的时代已经过去了”。今天的拉丁美洲已经不仅不是一百多年前的拉丁美洲，而且也不是六年前颠覆危地马拉政府的时候的拉丁美洲了，美国在拉丁美洲的败局已经是无可挽回的了。因此，艾森豪威尔此次南美之行不但徒劳无功，而且更加激起了拉丁美洲人民反美怒潮的新高涨。既然艾森豪威尔已经用他自己的言行表明，美国根本无意改变它对拉丁美洲的侵略政策，仍然妄图阻挡拉丁美洲历史车轮前进的道路，那末等待着美帝国主义的，肯定将不仅仅是丢脸而已。
