    Moving Towards Automation and Semi-Automation

    Continuous Dyeing of Fabric
    The workers of Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory have made significant improvements to the combined pad-dyeing machine and have also manufactured a flat-width boiling machine, making the entire fabric dyeing process a continuous production line. After the white cloth is fed into the machine, it takes only about five hours to dye it into colored cloth. The dyeing production cycle has been shortened from the original seventy-two hours to about five hours.

    Single-Machine Automatic Punch Press
    Liu Hongzi, an apprentice in the Material Preparation Section of the Second Workshop of Qingdao Foundry Machinery Factory, successfully modified a single-machine automatic punch press. Previously, this punch press punched 600 pads per hour; after being converted to automatic, it punches more than 2,700 per hour. Previously, it required two people to operate; now, it only requires one person to manage by pressing a button.

    Automation of Paper Production
    Liuzhou Paper Mill in Guangxi has completely eliminated heavy manual labor and manual operations, basically realizing automation of the entire factory's production.
    Due to the realization of production automation, the entire factory has saved two-thirds of its labor force, and the daily output of cardboard has jumped from 400 kilograms in the past to 3,200 kilograms, with a significant improvement in quality.

    Automatic Planing of Arc Surfaces
    Chen Deyun, a master craftsman in the Milling and Planing Section of the Fifth Workshop of Wuhan Changhong Machinery Factory, boldly innovated and created "automatic planing of arc surfaces" on a shaper, breaking the superstition that shapers cannot automatically plane arc surfaces, and increasing efficiency by two times; previously, only two pieces could be planed per shift, now six pieces can be planed, while ensuring quality.

    Automatic Coal Unloading with Battery Cars
    Qi Liangen, a veteran worker at Hankou Power Plant, created a device for automatic coal unloading with battery cars. This device has a simple structure and is easy to use, reducing the labor intensity of workers; each car of coal can save four coal unloading workers.

    Automated Radio Inspection
    Inspection personnel at Nanjing Radio Factory have innovated inspection methods. In the past half-month, thirty inspection devices have been automated, resulting in seven automatic inspection lines; more than two hundred kinds of parts and finished products have been inspected automatically instead of manually, greatly improving the inspection quality and efficiency of these parts and products.

    Automatic Stamping Die for Spring Washers
    Zhao Guoying, a female turner at Dezhou Machine Tool Factory in Dezhou, Shandong Province, recently successfully created an automatic stamping die for spring washers. This stamping die can automatically control three processes: turning, drilling, and cutting, increasing production efficiency by 2,400 times, completing eight years' worth of work in one day.

    Semi-Automatic Handling and Loading/Unloading
    At the Beijing Eastern Suburb Mechanized Coal Briquette Factory, the unloading, transferring of raw coal outside the workshop, and the supply of materials to the workshop have been self-sliding. Workers only need to press buttons and adjust the equipment, and hundreds or thousands of tons of coal powder and coal blocks will automatically flow into the machine room, be rolled into coal briquettes, improving production efficiency, and saving half of the factory's production workers.

    Automatic Grain and Oil Dispensing Lines
    Employees of the Yixin District First Grain Store in Yichun City, Heilongjiang Province, successfully created three automatic lines for selling rice, flour, and oil, eliminating heavy manual labor such as carrying, scooping, moving, and transporting in the process of selling grain, flour, and oil, improving efficiency by four to six times, allowing one person to sell 25,000 jin of grain a day with ease and enjoyment.

    Photoelectric Automatic Controller
    Li Qiquan, a technician at the Power Supply Station of Wuhan Electric Power Bureau, successfully trial-produced a semiconductor photoelectric controller. This instrument can use the intensity of natural light to automatically control the "stopping" and "opening" of city street lights in the morning and evening; after appropriate reforms, it can also be used for automated unmanned elevators, product recorders, automatic recording of the number of lightning strikes at night, automatic safety parking, automatic photoelectric alarms, and other automatic controls.

    Stamping Linkage Line
    Hu Xiangzhu, a technician from a worker background at Dalian Motor Factory, and the workers together made the first linkage line in the country for manufacturing motor stamping stator laminations, reducing the number of workers from the past twelve to three, increasing efficiency by more than 50%, and ensuring production safety.

    Electric Weighing Scale for Measurement and Pricing
    Salespersons at the Red Flag Store in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, collectively made an electric weighing scale for measurement and pricing. This scale can complete the two processes of weighing and pricing at one time, which can improve work efficiency by three times.

    "Five-Eyed" Machine Automatic Production Line
    Employees of the Hardware Crafts Factory in Zhongshan District, Dalian City, created an automatic production line with a five-eyed machine. With this automatic line, only one person needs to put raw materials into the machine, and the machine can automatically produce finished products through four processes, increasing output by four times compared to the past.

    Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory has produced the "C38M Automatic Machine Group Electrical Control Panel". It can be operated by simply pressing the indicator light and flipping the button. Previously, when operating a single machine, it required seven people to control.

    Tianjin Standard Parts Factory, with its simple equipment and weak technical strength, has produced an automatic production line for manufacturing screws and nuts, combining eight processes into one, eliminating the need to transport semi-finished products back and forth between processes.

    Yang Shixiong, an inspection technician at Shanghai Electric Meter Factory, made a semi-automatic device for calibrating electric meters, which can calibrate twenty at a time, increasing efficiency by more than ten times. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Ping photo.

    向自动化半自动化迈进
    染布全部连续化
    天津市织染厂职工把联合轧染机作了重要改进，又制成了平幅煮炼机，使整个染布过程变成了连续化生产。白布投入机器以后，只经过五小时左右，就可以染成色布。染布生产周期由原来的七十二小时缩短到五小时左右。
    单机自动冲床
