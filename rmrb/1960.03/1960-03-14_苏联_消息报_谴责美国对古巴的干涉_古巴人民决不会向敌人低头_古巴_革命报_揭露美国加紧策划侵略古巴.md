    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th: The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" today published a commentary on the Cuban "La Coubre" ship explosion incident, stating that this event shows that the US ruling clique is attempting to intimidate the Cuban people with despicable methods, but this is futile. The six million Cuban people will never bow their heads before the enemy.
    The commentary pointed out that when the Cuban revolution had just triumphed, US imperialism attempted to carry out armed intervention in Cuba. In order to oppose this US military threat, the Cuban people had no choice but to arm themselves.
    The commentary said that the Cuban people have every reason to question the United States: Why is it hindering the Cuban government from purchasing arms? Why is the United States exerting pressure on countries like Britain and France, forbidding them from selling arms to Cuba? Why is it that after Belgium agreed to sell some weapons to Cuba, the United States used various methods to obstruct it?
    The commentary said that some members of the US ruling clique have openly declared that they want to carry out military intervention in Cuba, but now all freedom-loving people in the world firmly support the Cuban revolutionary government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 12th: "Revolución" pointed out in a commentary today that the US government is plotting a new conspiracy to invade Cuba, attempting to use one of its lackeys through the Organization of American States as the vanguard for carrying out the invasion. "Revolución" pointed out that Cuba will not submit to Washington's planned "disarmament" proposal, and the Cuban people are generously donating funds to purchase weapons for self-defense. The Cuban people will absolutely not allow any foreign soldier to trample on their homeland at will. Cuba already has the necessary weapons to defend the motherland: the people, justice, and courage.
    Reports from US news agencies confirm that the United States is stepping up its planning of conspiracies to invade Cuba. An Associated Press dispatch on the 11th said that Washington experts revealed that the US plan for the Cuban issue is to discuss it in the Peace Committee of the Organization of American States, putting forward the so-called "threat" of the Castro regime to the peace of the Caribbean region. Then, the Organization of American States will take action based on the so-called Pan-American declaration against communist interference in the affairs of any country in this hemisphere.

    古巴“革命报”揭露美国加紧策划侵略古巴
    据新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联“消息报”今天就古巴“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸事件发表评论说，这个事件表明，美国统治集团企图用卑鄙的手法来恫吓古巴人民，但这是徒劳的。六百万古巴人民决不会在敌人面前低头。
    评论指出，在古巴革命刚刚胜利的时候，美帝国主义就企图对古巴进行武装干涉。为了反对美国的这种军事威胁，古巴人民不得不武装起来。
    评论说，古巴人民完全有理由质问美国，为什么阻碍古巴政府购买军火？为什么美国要对英、法等国施加压力，不许他们卖军火给古巴？为什么当比利时答应卖给古巴一些武器以后，美国却要用各种方法进行阻挠？
    评论说，在美国统治集团中有人公开声明要对古巴进行军事干涉，但是，现在世界上一切爱好自由的人民都坚决支持古巴革命政府。
    据新华社哈瓦那12日电　“革命报”今天在一篇评论中指出，美国政府正在策划侵略古巴的新阴谋，企图利用它的一个走狗通过美洲国家组织作为进行侵略的先锋。“革命报”指出，古巴不屈从华盛顿策划的“裁军”建议，古巴人民在慷慨捐款来购买自卫的武器。古巴人民绝对不允许任何一个外国士兵任意践踏祖国的领土。古巴已经拥有保卫祖国的必要武器：人民、正义和勇敢。
    美国通讯社的消息证实美国正加紧策划侵略古巴的阴谋。美联社11日发出的一条消息说，华盛顿专家透露，美国对于古巴问题的计划是在美洲国家组织的和平委员会进行讨论，提出所谓卡斯特罗政权“威胁”加勒比海地区的和平。然后美洲国家组织根据所谓反对共产主义干涉本半球任何国家事务的泛美声明采取行动。
