Today's Baicheng

Baicheng Special District is located in the northwest of Jilin Province, bordering the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province to the west and north. It has a total area of ​​45,691 square kilometers. This area was originally a sandy, arid, and barren plain, once known as the "Eight Hundred Li Dry Sea." Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, people have waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, transforming the entire region.

The special district has a total of nine counties (cities), with more than ten ethnic groups including Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Korean, totaling more than 2.05 million people, who are living an increasingly prosperous and happy life. The area is rich in grain, soybeans, and various industrial raw materials. In 1959, the total grain output reached 1.51 million tons, an increase of 92.65% compared with the early days of the People's Republic in 1949, with an average of 1,700 jin of grain per person. The special district also has 1.85 million hectares of beautiful grassland, which has been well utilized, enabling rapid development of animal husbandry throughout the region. The number of large livestock has now doubled compared to 1943, the highest level before liberation. The number of pigs has increased more than eleven times compared to 1949; while sheep have increased by 5.6 times. In order to change the sandy and arid conditions, the people of this region have carried out large-scale artificial afforestation in recent years. Now they have more than 550,000 hectares of artificial forests and seedling fields, forming forest belts and networks, and beautifying cities and villages.

The material resources of the Baicheng area are very rich and have been vigorously explored and utilized. It is rich in wool, pig bristles, horse tails, fish, eggs, and other products. It also produces various animals such as foxes, wolves, badgers, and gazelles. More than a hundred kinds of valuable medicinal materials such as ephedra, safflower, and codonopsis pilosula produced here are also sold well in various provinces. In particular, there are nearly a hundred kinds of grasses, such as Leymus chinensis, bristlegrass, foreign grass, reeds, and wild hemp, which are one of the main specialties here, with an annual output of more than one million tons. These grasses are good raw materials for the production of man-made fibers and other light industrial products; especially the reeds, which cover an area of ​​100,000 hectares and produce 150,000 to 160,000 tons annually, making them an important raw material production base for the paper industry. In addition, the area is also rich in salt, alkali, nitrate, brine, etc. These important industrial raw materials are also sold well throughout the country. The fishery has also developed rapidly. Last year, the fish output reached 25,856 tons. Fresh fish is processed by canning factories and also sold to foreign countries.

The Baicheng area also has rich mineral deposits underground. According to surveys, there are rich iron ore, coalfields, mica, oil shale, petroleum and other more than 50 kinds of minerals. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the guidance of the general line and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, the state and the people's communes have mobilized the masses to vigorously explore underground treasures and have achieved great achievements, producing a large amount of iron, steel, coal, etc., thus ending the history of the Baicheng area not producing iron, steel, coal and oil.

    今日白城
    白城专区位于吉林省西北部，西、北同内蒙古自治区和黑龙江省相毗连，总面积达四万五千六百九十一平方公里。这里原是风沙干旱的沙荒大平原，曾有“八百里旱海”之称。解放以来，在党的领导下，人们向自然灾害进行顽强的斗争，使整个地区面貌焕然一新。
    专区共有九个县（市），有汉、满、蒙、回、朝鲜等十多个民族，共二百零五万多人，他们过着蒸蒸日上的幸福生活。这里盛产粮食、大豆和各种工业原料。1959年粮食总产量达一百五十一万吨，比建国初期1949年增长92．65％，平均每人占有粮食达一千七百斤。专区还有一百八十五万公顷优美的大草原，它得到了很好的利用，使全区畜牧业获得迅速发展。现在大牲畜比解放前最高量的1943年增加了一倍。猪比1949年增长十一倍多；羊则增加了五点六倍。这个地区人民为了改变风沙干旱，几年来进行了大规模的人工造林，现在已经拥有人工林、苗田五十五万多公顷，形成了林带、林网，并美化了城市和乡村。
    白城地区的物产资源十分丰富，并且已被大力挖掘利用。盛产羊毛、猪鬃、马尾、鱼、蛋等。还出产狐狸、狼、獾子、黄羊等各种动物。此地出产的名贵的麻黄、红花、党参等百多种药材也畅销省外各地。特别是草类，如小叶章、猪鬃草、洋草、芦苇和野生麻等也有近百种，是这里的主要特产之一，每年产量达百余万吨。这些草类是制作人造纤维等轻工业产品的良好原料；尤其是这里的芦苇面积达十万公顷，年产十五、六万吨，成为造纸工业重要的原料产地之一。此外，这里还盛产盐、碱、硝、卤水等，这些重要工业原料，也畅销全国各地。渔业发展也很迅速，去年鱼产量达二万五千八百五十六吨，鲜鱼经过罐头厂加工，还远销到国外。
    白城地区地下也蕴藏着丰富的矿藏。据勘察，有丰富的铁矿、煤田、云母、油母页岩、石油等五十多种矿产。自1958年大跃进以来，在总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针指导下，国家和人民公社发动群众大力挖掘地下宝藏，取得了巨大成就，生产出大量的铁、钢、煤等，从此结束了白城地区不产钢铁、煤炭和石油的历史。（白城计委通讯组）
