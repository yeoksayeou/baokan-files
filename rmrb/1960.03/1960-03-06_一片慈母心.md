    A Motherly Heart
    Paintings by Yang Zhijian and Chen Lijun, Poem by Yang Wenqian
    Inside the window, all is quiet,
    The baby is sleeping soundly.
    Only the fragrance of flowers is smelled,
    Only the buzzing of bees is seen.
    The nanny's footsteps are light,
    Looking at the baby by the bed,
    Covering her with a little flowered quilt,
    Closing the door carefully.
    A motherly heart,
    A red heart and skillful hands,
    Like a flower grower,
    Taking care diligently.
    Inside the window, all is quiet,
    Outside the window, the spring scenery is beautiful,
    Mother is in the fields,
    Bringing good news again. (With attached image)

    一片慈母心
    杨志坚、陈丽君　作画  杨文倩　配诗
    窗里静悄悄，
    宝宝睡着了。
    但闻花儿香，
    但见蜂儿闹。
    阿姨脚步轻，
    床前看宝宝，
    盖上小花被，
    把门儿关好。
    一片慈母心，
    心红手又巧，
    好比种花人，
    辛勤来照料。
    窗里静悄悄，
    窗外春光好，
    妈妈在田头，
    又把喜讯报。（附图片）
