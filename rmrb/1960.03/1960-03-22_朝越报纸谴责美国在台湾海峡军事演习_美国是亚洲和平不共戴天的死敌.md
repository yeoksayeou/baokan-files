Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 21st. The "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published a commentary today stating that the Korean people resolutely condemn the military "exercises" recently conducted by US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait. This "exercise" is another serious hostile action against the Chinese people and a new provocative action attempting to intensify the tension in the Far East. "This military provocative act by US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait more clearly proves that the US imperialist aggressors are the masterminds behind the criminal plot to intensify aggression and tension in the Far East, and they are an irreconcilable enemy of Asian peace."

The commentary said: This fact proves that although US imperialism is talking glibly about "peace" and "talks," it has completely exposed its intention not to take any measures to disarm and further ease international tensions. This fact also clearly proves that US imperialists are using two-faced tactics behind the smokescreen of "peace" and "talks," frantically trying to buy time to salvage their bankrupt "strength" policy.

The commentary pointed out that no matter how desperately US imperialism struggles, it cannot save its doomed fate. The power of the socialist camp is growing stronger day by day, becoming an invincible force. Anyone who wants to offend this great force is like a foolish person hitting a rock with his head.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 21st. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today on the military "exercises" currently being conducted by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Taiwan Strait, pointing out that "this blatant provocative action once again exposes the US imperialist ambition to continue creating tension in Asia and continue plotting aggression against Asia."

The commentary said, "Under the guise of 'joint defense,' US imperialist warmongers are intensifying interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries, attempting to launch a war of aggression in this region, primarily plotting against the People's Republic of China. This US-Chiang exercise in the Taiwan region is part of the US imperialist plan to wage war and aggression in Asia."

The commentary concluded by pointing out that in the current international situation, US imperialism can absolutely not cover up the fact that the balance of power has tilted towards peace and the people of all countries who are united. If they dare to launch a new war adventurously, the consequence they will suffer will be their complete annihilation.

    朝越报纸谴责美国在台湾海峡军事演习
    美国是亚洲和平不共戴天的死敌
    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义最近在台湾海峡进行的军事“演习”，这种“演习”是反对中国人民的又一个严重的敌对行动，也是企图加剧远东紧张局势的新的挑衅行动。“美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行的这次军事挑衅行为，更加清楚地证明了美帝国主义侵略者是在远东地区加紧侵略和紧张局势的犯罪阴谋的主谋者，它是亚洲和平的不共戴天的死敌”。
    评论说：这一事实证明，现在美帝国主义虽然侈谈“和平”、“会谈”，实际上已经完全暴露它并没有采取任何裁军和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的措施的意图。这一事实，又清楚地证明，美帝国主义者在侈谈“和平”、“会谈”的烟幕后面采取两面手法，疯狂地想争取时间挽回早已破产的“实力”政策。
    评论指出，但是，美帝国主义不管怎样垂死挣扎，也挽救不了它那日暮途穷的命运。社会主义阵营的威力日益壮大，成为不可战胜的力量。如果谁想冒犯这个伟大的力量，就等于是用脑袋碰岩石的愚蠢的人。
    新华社河内21日电　越南“人民报”今天就美帝国主义和蒋介石集团目前正在台湾海峡举行的军事“演习”发表评论指出，“这种明目张胆的挑衅行动，再一次暴露了美帝国主义继续制造亚洲紧张局势、继续阴谋侵略亚洲的野心”。
    评论说，“在‘共同防御’的幌子下，美帝国主义好战分子正在加紧干涉亚洲各国内政，企图在这个地区发动侵略战争，首先是阴谋反对中华人民共和国。这次美蒋在台湾地区的演习，正是美帝国主义在亚洲进行战争和侵略的计划的组成部分”。
    评论最后指出，在当前的国际局势下，美帝国主义绝对掩盖不了这样的事实：即力量对比的天平已倒向和平和团结起来的各国人民方面。如果他们敢于冒险地发动新战争，他们遭到的后果将是他们被彻底地消灭。
