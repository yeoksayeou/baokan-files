The people of Hubei, who suffered from a severe drought last year, have made arduous efforts over the past winter and spring. The water storage capacity of newly built water conservancy projects has increased approximately twice as much as the water storage capacity of water conservancy projects built since liberation. Nearly ten million mu of new wasteland have been reclaimed; more than nine million mu of dry land and slope land have been transformed into paddy fields and terraced fields; fourteen million mu of land have been made into garden-like fields; and ten million mu of "low-yield fields" have entered the ranks of advanced fields...

    (Our report) The broad masses of the people in Hubei Province, who suffered from a severe drought last year, are fighting under the leadership of Party committees at all levels with full enthusiasm to win the first bumper harvest of the 1960s. At present, more than six million laborers throughout the province have been put into spring ploughing production. Red flags are flying everywhere, and the scene is bustling with activity. According to statistics, the base fertilizer for more than 40 million mu of spring-sown crops in the province has been basically prepared; more than 20 million mu of winter fallow land have been plowed and leveled once or twice; and more than 4 million mu of early and mid-season rice seedling fields have been prepared as smooth as mirrors.
    The unprecedented spring ploughing production movement in Hubei Province is a new development in the high tide of agricultural capital construction focusing on water management, soil management, and mountain management that was launched last winter. Last year, the exceptionally severe drought caused reduced production in some areas of Hubei, bringing some difficulties to this year's spring ploughing production. However, the heroic people of Hubei were not intimidated by the difficulties. They held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fought against the difficulties with full confidence, determined to win a bumper agricultural harvest this year. Last winter, in order to overcome and prevent natural disasters and ensure a great leap forward in agricultural production, the people of the province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, launched a magnificent battle to transform nature. All localities resoundingly put forward the slogan "Make rivers obey our commands, turn barren land into fertile land, and turn poor mountains into rich mountains." After several months, the entire rural landscape of Hubei has undergone great changes, and agricultural production conditions have undergone tremendous changes: the province has completed more than 800 million cubic meters of earth and stone work in water conservancy construction, almost equivalent to half of the total amount of earth and stone work completed in water conservancy construction since liberation, and the increase in water storage capacity in the province is approximately twice the water storage capacity of newly built water conservancy projects since liberation. Various localities have opened up nearly 10 million mu of wasteland, close to 15% of the original total cultivated land; a total of more than 9 million mu of dry land have been converted into paddy fields, and slope land has been converted into terraced fields; and more than 26 million mu of land have been leveled, of which approximately 14 million mu have initially reached the standard of garden-like fields. This makes it possible for agricultural production in Hubei Province to develop at an even faster pace.
    Since the beginning of spring, the people of the province, in the spirit of continuous revolution and with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, have rapidly launched a new high tide of production centered on spring ploughing preparations. This high tide started unusually early and quickly swept the province, achieving brilliant results. Manure accumulation and delivery, repair of farm tools, drying of seeds, plowing of land, and preparation of seedling fields were all carried out about a month earlier than in previous years, and the progress was fast and the quality was good. Xiangyang Prefecture, which was famous for its large-scale "three managements" last winter, plans to sow more than 8 million mu this spring. By the beginning of March, more than 80% had been plowed and tilled more than twice, of which more than 4 million mu had been plowed and tilled three to four times. The tilled layer is generally between eight inches and one foot, and the shallowest is also five or six inches. Jingzhou Prefecture, most of which is located in the Jianghan Plain, actively carried out deep digging and winter plowing activities in double-cropping cotton fields in order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest and break with convention. Based on the experience of fighting drought last year, all localities also paid great attention to water storage and conservation. Most reservoirs and ponds in Xiangyang, Huanggang, Wuhan and other regions have been filled with water.
    Seizing and grasping the weak links in production is one of the important measures taken by Hubei Province this year to strive for balanced increases in production and ensure the sustained leap forward in agricultural production. As early as the end of last year, Party committees at all levels started by summarizing bumper harvest models and identified the weak links in production. The most important of these was that there were still 15 million mu of low-yield fields (land) in the province, most of which were distributed in about 20% of the backward teams. In order to change this situation, all localities transferred a large number of cadres to the production teams and production squads to strengthen specific leadership at the forefront. Zaoyang County, which is famous for transforming sandy land, implemented "six aspects on the job" (leadership, fertilizer, livestock, tools, water conservancy, and technology) and vigorously attacked backwardness in the transformation of low-yield fields. Many areas also took the lead in running experimental fields and launched a large-scale campaign to transform low-yield fields. Lichuan County alone established more than 2,300 experimental bases to eliminate low-yield fields. As a result of vigorously grasping the backward, 10 million mu of low-yield fields in the province have now entered the ranks of the advanced. At the same time, all localities also attach great importance to increasing the yield of miscellaneous grains. Judging from the situation reflected by various localities, Hubei Province this year is grasping miscellaneous grain production earlier and better than in any previous year. In Xiangyang, Yichang, Enshi and other prefectures, which are rich in corn, the spring sowing land has mostly been prepared and the base fertilizer has been applied sufficiently.
    As a result of large-scale agricultural capital construction last winter, the cultivated land area in Hubei Province has increased sharply from more than 60 million mu last year to more than 70 million mu. In addition, the requirements for increasing production technology measures have been further improved. As a result, solving the contradiction of insufficient labor has become the key issue for whether this year can achieve a sustained leap forward. To this end, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on realizing "four reforms and two eliminations" (reform transportation, water lifting, farming, and processing tools, eliminate shoulder carrying and manpower water wheels) is vigorously developing in the vast rural areas of Hubei. After more than a month of hard work, Jingzhou Prefecture has basically realized the motorization and boatization of transportation in the plain lakeside areas. It has also created 560,000 pieces of various improved farming tools, which basically meet the needs of spring ploughing production. Many counties in Xiangyang Prefecture, while basically eliminating shoulder carrying, have tapped the potential of water, made full use of water power as power, and set up more than 7,700 hydropower processing plants. With this item alone, the prefecture can save more than 140,000 laborers throughout the year.
    At present, the spring ploughing season has arrived, and a new high tide has emerged in the province-wide spring ploughing production movement in Hubei Province. All localities in the province are conducting a province-wide great debate on technical reform, implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions, and vigorously implementing various production-increasing technical measures. In order to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest this year, Party committees at all levels, in the spirit of grasping both production and life with one hand, have dispatched large-scale production and life inspection teams, including secretaries, to go deep into various localities to specifically arrange the lives of the masses and strengthen the organization and leadership of production, so as to further organize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and push the current mass movement of spring ploughing production to a higher peak.

    湖北人民干劲足　备耕工作成绩大
    去年遭受大旱袭击的湖北人民，经过去冬今春的艰苦努力，新建水利工程蓄水量比解放以来兴修水利工程蓄水量增加了大约一倍；新垦荒地近一千万亩；九百多万亩旱地、坡地变成了水地、梯田；一千四百万亩土地实现了园田化；一千万亩“低产田”跨进了先进行列……。
    本报讯　去年遭大旱袭击的湖北省广大人民，正在各级党委的领导下，干劲冲天地为夺取六十年代第一个大丰收而战。目前，全省投入春耕生产的劳动力达六百多万人，满山遍野，到处红旗招展，热火朝天。据统计，全省四千多万亩春播作物的底肥已经基本备足；二千多万亩冬闲田普遍翻耕平整了一遍到两遍；四百多万亩早、中稻秧田整得一平如镜。
    湖北省规模空前的春耕生产运动，是去冬掀起以治水、治土、治山为内容的农业基本建设高潮的新发展。去年，异常严重的干旱曾使湖北部分地区减产，给今年的春耕生产带来一些困难。但是，英雄的湖北人民，没有被困难吓倒，他们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，满怀信心地向困难作斗争，决心夺取今年的农业大丰收。去年冬天，为克服和防止自然灾害，保证农业生产大跃进，全省人民在各级党委的领导下，掀起了宏伟的改造自然的战斗。各地响亮地提出了“要江河听使唤，要薄地变良田，要穷山变富山”的口号。经过几个月的时间，整个湖北农村面貌大大改观，农业生产条件起了巨大变化：全省在兴修水利方面完成土、石方八亿多立方米，几乎相当于解放以来兴修水利完成土、石方总数的一半，全省增加的蓄水量，比解放以来新建水利工程的蓄水量增加了大约一倍；各地开了近一千万亩的荒地，接近于原有总耕地的15％；旱地改水田和坡地改梯地共九百多万亩；平整土地二千六百多万亩，其中约有一千四百多万亩初步达到了园田化的标准。这样，就使湖北省的农业生产有可能以更高的速度向前发展。
    入春以来，全省人民本着不断革命的精神，以更高的革命热情，迅速地掀起了以备耕为中心的生产新高潮。这个高潮一开始就异乎寻常，并且很快席卷全省，获得了辉煌的成果。积肥送肥，整修农具，翻晒种籽，翻耕土地，整理秧田，都比往年提早了一个月左右，而且进度快、质量好。去冬以大搞“三治”闻名的襄阳专区，今年计划春播面积为八百多万亩，到3月上旬止，已经犁整过两次以上的就占80％以上，其中有四百多万亩已犁整过三次到四次；耕层一般都在八寸到一尺左右，最浅的也有五、六寸。大部分地区处于江汉平原的荆州专区，为了争取棉花丰产，打破常规，积极开展了两熟棉田的深挖冬凛活动。根据去年抗旱的经验，各地还十分注意蓄水保水工作。襄阳、黄冈、武汉等地区大多数水库和塘堰已经蓄满了水。
    大抓特抓生产中的薄弱环节，是湖北省今年争取平衡增产，保证农业生产持续跃进的重要措施之一。早在去年年底，各级党委从总结丰产典型入手，找出了生产中的薄弱环节。其中最主要的薄弱环节是，全省还有一千五百万亩低产田（地），大部分分布在约占20％的落后队。为了改变这一状况，各地抽调了大批干部下放到生产队和生产小队，加强第一线的具体领导。以改造岗地著名的枣阳县，在改造低产田中，实行了领导、肥料、牲畜、工具、水利、技术等“六上岗”，猛攻落后。许多地区还通过干部带头，大办试验田，向低产田大举进军，仅利川县就建立了消灭低产田的试验基地达二千三百多处。由于大抓落后的结果，目前，全省已有一千万亩低产田跨进了先进行列。和这同时，各地对提高杂粮的产量，也十分重视。从各地反映的情况看，今年湖北省在杂粮生产上比哪一年都抓得早、抓得好。盛产包谷的襄阳、宜昌、恩施等专区，目前春播地大都整好，并且底肥下得比较足。
    由于去冬大搞农业基本建设的结果，湖北省耕地面积从去年六千多万亩猛增到七千多万亩，加上增产技术措施的要求有了进一步提高，这样一来，解决劳动力不足的矛盾，便成了今年能否持续跃进的关键问题。为此，在各级党委领导下，一个以实现“四改两消灭”（改革运输、提水、耕作和加工工具，消灭肩担和人力车水）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在湖北广大农村蓬勃发展。荆州专区经过一个多月的奋战，平原滨湖地区已经基本上实现了运输车子化、木船化，还创制出各种改良耕作工具五十六万件，基本上满足了春耕生产的需要。襄阳专区许多县在基本消灭肩担的同时，大挖水的潜力，充分利用水力作动力，办起了水力加工厂七千七百多处，仅此一项，这个专区全年即可节省十四万多个劳动力。
    目前，春耕季节已经到来，湖北省全民性的春耕生产运动出现了新高潮。全省各地通过全民性的技术改革大辩论，正因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，大力贯彻各项增产技术措施。为了确保今年农业大丰收，各级党委本着一手抓生产，一手抓生活的精神，已派出包括有书记参加的规模庞大的生产、生活检查团，分头深入各地具体安排群众生活和加强对生产的组织领导，进一步把广大群众的革命热情组织起来，把当前春耕生产的群众运动推向更高峰。
