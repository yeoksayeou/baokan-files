    Elevate Corn to the Status of Staple Food
    By Editorial Staff
    Many regions are now formulating this year's agricultural production plans in accordance with the spirit of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. At this time, practical and active arrangements should be made for expanding the planting of corn and cultivating it well. Chinese and foreign experiences have proven that corn is an excellent crop with multiple uses. Developing corn production is of great significance for increasing grain production and increasing feed production. Therefore, we must plant more corn in all places where conditions permit.
    Corn is a high-yielding crop, second only to rice in terms of yield per unit area, generally yielding 300 to 500 jin per mu. After improving cultivation techniques, the yield can be greatly increased. In 1959, Guang'an County, Sichuan Province, with 130,000 mu of early corn, averaged 746.5 jin per mu, an increase of 107.3% compared to 1958 (360 jin per mu). Among them, 50,147 mu averaged 1,028 jin per mu. Therefore, appropriately planting more corn and striving to increase its yield per unit area is an important measure to rapidly increase grain production.
    Corn is rightly called the "king of feed." Corn has a high utilization rate throughout the entire plant. Kernels can be used as concentrated feed, and its total nutritional value is the highest among all grain feeds. Stalks, husks, and cobs can also be processed into feed that livestock enjoy. Ensiling corn stalks is an excellent feed for livestock. The corn kernels produced on one mu alone can generally supply the concentrated feed needed for at least three or four pigs. Corn cobs, after being crushed into powder, can be used to feed pigs, especially suitable for feeding young pigs. Therefore, increasing corn production has a great positive effect on developing animal husbandry, especially pig farming. In Fengrun County, Hebei Province, where corn is planted extensively, the county raised more than 200,000 pigs in 1959, an increase of 44.4% compared to 1958. In that year, corn stalks accounted for more than 80% of the roughage needed for pig raising, and the county's large livestock also saw great development.
    The two major sectors of the agricultural economy—planting and animal husbandry—are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The development of planting can provide abundant grain and feed, preparing the material foundation for the development of animal husbandry. The development of animal husbandry can provide more and more fertilizer, promoting the further development of planting. One of the important keys to developing animal husbandry is to find the most effective and economical ways to increase grain and feed production, and developing corn production is one such way. From this perspective, whether corn production can be increased more and faster is related to the development prospects of the two major sectors of agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, in today's all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, corn should be regarded as equally important as staple foods such as rice and wheat.
    Corn has a wide adaptability, from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island in the south. Whether it is plains, hills, or mountains, corn can be grown extensively. The sowing period of corn is relatively long. In the north, it can be spring-sown or summer-sown; in the south, it can be spring-sown, summer-sown, or autumn-sown; and in some places, double-cropping of corn can also be planted. Since last winter, various regions have reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, and it is possible to use some of the newly reclaimed land to plant corn. At the same time, due to the large-scale water conservancy construction and soil improvement carried out in various regions, the improved production conditions can better facilitate the planting of corn according to the principle of adapting to local conditions. Corn plants are relatively tall and can be intercropped or interplanted with some short-stalk crops (such as beans, potatoes, peanuts, etc.), which can not only increase land utilization but also produce more corn.
    Further improving the yield of corn per unit area is an important issue that must be vigorously resolved in order to develop corn production. Although corn is a crop with high-yield potential, there are currently large differences in yield between different regions and seasons. Generally, the yield of spring corn is higher than that of summer and autumn corn, and the yield of irrigated corn is higher than that of dryland corn. Judging from the estimated yield in 1959, there were eleven provinces, autonomous regions, and cities with an average corn yield of 300 to 500 jin per mu, and the corn planting area in these regions accounted for about half of the national corn planting area. There was also about 6.5% of the corn nationwide with an average yield of less than 200 jin per mu. Therefore, striving to comprehensively improve the yield of corn per unit area is an important way to increase corn production. This year, Sichuan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan, and other provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, have appropriately expanded the planting ratio of high-yielding and stable-yielding early corn (spring corn), which will undoubtedly have a significant effect on increasing corn production. Various regions should also conduct careful summary research on local corn production, especially the low-yielding summer and autumn corn production, find out the key issues for increasing production, and actively take all effective measures to transform low-yield into high-yield, and high-yield into even higher yield.
    Vigorously promoting improved corn varieties, especially medium- and late-maturing dent corn varieties and hybrid varieties, is the most economical and effective measure to ensure increased corn production. These improved varieties have excellent characteristics of high yield and strong disease resistance, and can generally increase production by 15% to 30%, and in some cases, more than double. At present, more than 150 excellent hybrid varieties have been selected and bred throughout the country. After demonstration and promotion, they have all shown significant yield increases, but the planting area of these improved varieties is still not large. Various regions should further strengthen the selection, breeding, and promotion of hybrid varieties, train and cultivate technical backbones, and plan to organize specialized seed teams within the people's communes, establish seed breeding bases, so that existing improved corn varieties and hybrid varieties can be rapidly popularized and continuously improved.
    This year, many regions have great enthusiasm and high demands for increasing corn production. Many places in the south have put forward the battle cry of "corn yield catching up with rice," and many places in Hebei, Jiangsu, and other provinces have proposed to carry out a competition movement for "thousand-jin corn high-yield plots." This situation shows that it is highly promising to increase corn production more this year than in previous years. Our task is to make unremitting efforts to gradually turn the possibility of a large increase in corn production into reality. And the most fundamental way to achieve this task is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command. Party organizations at all levels must place corn in an equally important position as staple foods such as rice and wheat in arranging production and guiding production, strengthen specific leadership, implement a management responsibility system, and from sowing to field management to harvesting, firmly grasp key measures, link each link tightly, and manage it through to the end.

    把玉米提到主粮地位
    本报评论员
    现在许多地区正在根据以粮为纲全面跃进的精神制定今年的农业生产计划，在这个时候应该对于扩种玉米和种好玉米作出切实的积极的安排。中国和外国的经验都证明，玉米是一种“一身多能”的优良作物，发展玉米生产，对于增产粮食、增产饲料都有重大意义。因此，我们要在一切有条件的地方多种玉米。
    玉米是一种高产作物，单位面积产量仅次于水稻，一般每亩收三百至五百斤；耕作技术改进以后，产量还可以大大提高。 1959年四川省广安县十三万亩早玉米，平均亩产七百四十六斤半，比1958年（亩产三百六十斤）增加107．3％，其中五万零一百四十七亩，平均亩产一千零二十八斤。因此，适当多种玉米，努力提高它的单位面积产量，是迅速增加粮食产量的一项重要的措施。
    玉米被人们称做“饲料之王”，是有道理的。玉米全身的利用率很高，籽粒可做精饲料，在所有谷物饲料中它的营养总量也最多。茎秆、包叶、穗轴等经过加工后也是牲畜喜爱的饲料。玉米秸秆青贮后更是牲畜的良好饲料。单是一亩地所产的玉米籽粒，一般至少可供三、四头猪所需的精饲料。玉米穗轴粉碎后可以喂猪，特别宜于喂架子猪。因此，增产玉米，对发展畜牧业特别是养猪业有着很大的积极作用。河北省丰润县种玉米较多，1959年全县养猪二十多万头，比1958年增加了44．4％。而这一年内养猪所需的粗饲料中玉米秸秆就占了80％以上，该县大牲畜也有了很大发展。
    农业经济的两大部门——种植业和畜牧业是互相依存、互相促进的；种植业的发展，可以提供丰富的粮食和饲料，为畜牧业的发展准备物质基础；畜牧业的发展，可以提供越来越多的肥料，促进种植业的进一步发展。而发展畜牧业的重要关键之一，就是要寻找增产粮食和饲料的最有效、最经济的途径，而发展玉米生产正是这样的途径之一。这样看来，能不能更多更快地增产玉米，关系着农牧业两大部门的发展前途。所以，在农林牧副渔全面发展的今天，要把玉米看得和大米、小麦等主粮同等重要。
    玉米的适应性很广，北起黑龙江，南到海南岛，无论是平原、丘陵、山地，都能大量种植玉米。玉米的播种期较长，在北方可以春播，也可以夏播；在南方可以春播、夏播、秋播；有些地方还可栽种双季玉米。去冬以来，各地都开垦了大量的荒地，用新开垦的一部分土地来种植玉米是可以的。同时，由于各地都进行了大规模的兴修水利、改良土壤等农田基本建设，生产条件改善后，也能更好地按照因地制宜的原则种植玉米。玉米的植株较高，可以同一些矮秆作物（如豆类、薯类、花生等）间作、套种，既能提高土地利用率，又能多种多收玉米。
    进一步提高玉米的单位面积产量，是发展玉米生产必须大力解决的一个重要问题。虽然玉米是一种具有高产能力的作物，但是目前在不同地区间、季节间产量有很大差异，一般是春玉米产量比夏、秋玉米产量高，水浇地的玉米产量比旱地的玉米产量要高。从1959年预计产量看，玉米平均亩产三百至五百斤的就有十一个省、自治区和市，这些地区的玉米种植面积约占全国玉米种植面积的一半左右；全国还有约占6．5％的玉米，平均亩产还不到二百斤。因此，争取全面提高玉米单位面积产量，是玉米增产的重要途径。今年四川、安徽、江苏、湖南等省和广西僮族自治区，根据两年来大跃进的经验，适当扩大了高产稳收的早玉米（春玉米）的种植比重，这对于提高玉米产量无疑将有显著作用。各地还应当对于当地的玉米生产，特别是产量较低的夏、秋玉米生产，认真进行总结研究，找出增产的关键问题，积极采取一切行之有效的措施，变低产为高产，高产更高产。
    大力推广玉米良种，特别是中、晚熟马齿型良种和杂交种，是保证玉米增产的最经济、最有效的措施。这些良种具有丰产、抗病力强的优良特性，一般可以增产15％到30％，多的可达一倍以上。现在全国各地已经选育的优良杂交种达一百五十多个，经示范推广，都有显著的增产成效，但这些良种的种植面积还不大。各地应当进一步加强杂交种的选育、繁殖、推广工作，训练和培养技术骨干，在人民公社内有计划地组织种子专业队，建立种子繁育基地，使现有玉米良种和杂交种迅速普及和不断提高。
    今年许多地区对于增产玉米的劲头很大，要求很高。南方不少地方提出了“玉米单产赶水稻”的战斗口号，河北、江苏等省的不少地方倡议开展“千斤玉米丰产方”竞赛运动。这种形势表明，今年比往年增产更多的玉米，是大有希望的。我们的任务是坚持不懈地努力，使玉米大增产的可能性逐步变为现实。而实现这个任务的最根本的办法还是在于加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。各级党的组织，在安排生产、指导生产上，一定要把玉米摆在和稻谷、小麦等主粮同等重要地位，加强具体领导，实行管理责任制，从播种到田间管理、到收获，要狠抓关键措施，环环扣紧，一着不让，一管到底。
