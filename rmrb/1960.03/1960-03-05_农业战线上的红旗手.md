	Red Banner Bearer on the Agricultural Front
		Our Correspondent Huang Zhensheng
	To reach Přerov County in the early morning, we left Prague by car at two o'clock in the morning. In the midst of heavy snow, we traveled three hundred kilometers and arrived in the ancient city of Přerov, which has a history of over seven hundred years, at dawn. We came to Přerov not because of its ancient history and moving ancient European architecture, but because it acted as a shock force in the Czechoslovak people's march towards agriculture, and is a red banner on the Czechoslovak agricultural front. At the entrance of the county people's committee building, there is an eye-catching banner that reads: "Cooperatives members of Přerov County, increase agricultural production by 9.75% in 1960." This is the battle call issued by the Party and the government to all the people of Přerov County.
	Although it was still early morning, a meeting was already being held in the office of Comrade Hajder, the first secretary of the Přerov County Committee of the Communist Party, and several people were waiting to be received by the first secretary.

	Challenging the Whole Country
	Comrade Hajder introduced to us the process by which Přerov County launched a competition across the country to strive to overfulfill the agricultural production plan. He said that in June last year, the resolution on implementing the new purchasing system and new unified purchasing prices in agriculture, passed by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, greatly encouraged the farmers of Přerov County. After detailed discussions, the members of the Prosenice Cooperative proposed to increase the cooperative's agricultural production by 17% in 1960. At the same time, they challenged all the fraternal cooperatives in the county. Based on the resolution of the Party Central Committee and the initiative of the Prosenice Cooperative, the county leadership issued a call to the entire county. Within five or six days, it received a response from all the cooperatives in the county. The county's party and government organs sent two hundred cadres to go deep into the cooperatives to mobilize the masses to formulate plans. Then a representative meeting of cooperative members from the entire county was held. The people of Přerov County issued a heroic challenge to the entire country—striving to increase agricultural production by 9.75% compared to 1959 in 1960, in celebration of the 15th anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of Czechoslovakia. The day after this meeting, Přerov County sent a delegation of cooperative representatives to Prague to report the wishes and guarantees of the county's farmers to President Novotný. The challenge and call of Přerov County shook the entire Czechoslovak countryside, because it expressed the feelings of the people loyal to the motherland to present the 15th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding labor achievements. Currently, 11,500 cooperatives have responded to this call.

	National Leading Achievements
	The farmers of Přerov County have proved with practical actions that they are good men who do what they say. In 1959, the county's wheat yield reached the target of 31.9 quintals per hectare, while the national average yield was 22.8 quintals per hectare. The rapeseed yield reached 20.5 quintals per hectare, while the national average yield was 14 quintals per hectare. In addition, the meat production was 220 kilograms per hectare, milk production was 945 liters, and egg production was 672 eggs, while the national average production was 122.5 kilograms of meat, 501 liters of milk, and 284 eggs per hectare. The annual milk production per dairy cow was 2,325 liters, with the highest reaching 3,190 liters.
	The enthusiastic challenge caused the 1959 output to greatly exceed that of 1958, with grain output increasing by 20.7%, milk by 9.1%, and eggs by 20%. This excellent achievement inspired the people of Přerov County and attracted the attention of the rural areas across the country.
	The county committee sent Comrade Čeladník to accompany us to visit two cooperatives in the county. Comrade Čeladník was transferred from the army's political work post to the county two months ago to work for half a year. He still retains the rigorous style of a soldier, does not speak much, but constantly reveals his joy for the new environment and new work. He said that in the county, being close to the masses can provide a lot of training.
	Although it is still snowing and the weather has not warmed up, preparations for spring plowing in the cooperatives have already begun. Some are repairing tractors, some are repairing other agricultural machinery, and some are sending fertilizer to the fields. The Prosenice Cooperative, the heroic cooperative that took the initiative to challenge the cooperatives across the county, won the county's mobile red flag due to its outstanding achievements last year. The chairman of the cooperative, Comrade K. Peter Vahrich, was originally a railway worker. Five years ago, in order to support agriculture, he voluntarily signed up to work in the countryside. Comrade Peter Vahrich is over fifty years old, simple and kind, and loves rural work. Even the little horses and calves in the cooperative are his close friends. He strokes them, and they wag their tails at him. In January of this year, the average daily milk yield of dairy cows in the Prosenice Cooperative reached 8.3 liters, exceeding the target by 0.3 liters.
	The pigsties and cowsheds of the Bančice Cooperative are also particularly clean, and are sunny and warm like spring. The livestock drinking water equipment here has been automated, and the transportation of feed and cow manure is also semi-mechanized. The female cooperative members are pushing large iron buckets with pulleys, which can hold one or two hundred kilograms, along the overhead rails, busy going in and out. Six female cooperative members manage seventy dairy cows and do the milking work. Last year, the average milk production per dairy cow in this dairy farm reached 3,179 liters (an average of 8.7 liters per cow per day), creating the highest record in the county and taking second place in the entire state. A female cooperative member here named Hagova worked 865 workdays last year. She excitedly told us that she will participate in a delegation from Přerov County next month to meet Comrade Novotný in Prague for the second time to report the good news to him.

	The Party and Cooperativization
	What are the reasons for Přerov County's outstanding achievements? Comrade Hajder, the first secretary of the county committee, answered this question clearly and firmly: first, relying on the leadership of the Party, and second, relying on cooperativization. Přerov County has a strong party organization. The county has a rural population of 30,000, with more than 600 party members. In 1957, there were only seventy party members in the county's rural areas. Because they attached great importance to the development of party organizations in the countryside, the party organizations have grown rapidly in the past two years. The county's party organizations at all levels study every important issue in agriculture. The county committee also frequently sends cadres to the countryside to go deep among the working people and help cooperatives mobilize the masses and do political work. Currently, in terms of ideological work, the party organization focuses on opposing the petty-bourgeois ideology of the small producers remaining in the farmers, as well as conservatism, religious superstition, etc. Cooperativization embodies great superiority. After several mergers, the increasingly large-scale cooperatives have demonstrated their power in completing many arduous soil improvement projects, clearing tens of thousands of meters of water pipes, and building irrigation and drainage projects. The enthusiasm of the people has written this glorious page of the history of Přerov County.
	Although it has only been a short two days, we and the people of Přerov County are already like old friends who have reunited after a long separation. Whether it is the comrades of the county committee, the cooperative chairman, the party committee chairman, the sugar beet expert, or the milkmaid, they all have a great interest in China. Almost at any time, one can hear their admiration for the high yield per unit area of agricultural production in our country. Some people enthusiastically inquired about the work and life of Chinese farmers after the organization of the people's communes, and asked us to convey their greetings to the Chinese farmers.

### 农业战线上的红旗手

    农业战线上的红旗手
    本报记者　黄振声
    为了要在清晨赶到普累罗夫县，我们深夜两点乘汽车从布拉格出发，在大雪纷飞中，走完了三百公里的路程，清晨到达了这个有着七百多年历史的普累罗夫古城。我们到普累罗夫来，并不是因为它的古老历史和动人的古代欧洲建筑，而是因为它在捷克斯洛伐克人民向农业的进军中，充当了突击手，是捷克斯洛伐克农业战线上的一面红旗。在县人民委员会大楼的门口，醒目地挂着一块标语牌，上面写着：“普累罗夫县的合作社社员们，要在1960年把农业生产提高9．75％”。这是党和政府向普累罗夫县全体人民发出的战斗号召。
    虽然还是清晨，但捷共县委第一书记哈依德尔同志的办公室里已经在开会，还有几个人在等候着第一书记的接见。
    向全国挑战
    哈依德尔同志向我们介绍了普累罗夫县向全国发起争取超额完成农业生产计划的竞赛的经过。他说，去年6月，捷共中央全会通过的关于在农业中实行新收购制度和新统一收购价格的决议，大大鼓舞了普累罗夫县的农民。普洛山尼采合作社的社员们详细讨论后，提出要在1960年把社的农业生产提高17％。同时，他们向全县各兄弟合作社提出了挑战。县的领导根据党中央的决议和普洛山尼采合作社的创议，向全县发出了号召。五、六天内得到了全县合作社的响应。县党政机关派出二百名干部深入合作社，动员群众制定计划。接着召开了全县合作社社员代表大会，普累罗夫县的人们向全国提出了英雄的挑战——争取在庆祝苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克十五周年的1960年，使农业生产比1959年提高9．75％。这次会后第二天，普累罗夫县派出了一个合作社代表团到布拉格，向诺沃提尼总统报告了全县农民的愿望和保证。普累罗夫县的挑战和号召，震动了全捷克斯洛伐克的农村，因为它表达出忠于祖国的人们要以优越的劳动成果向国庆十五周年献礼的心情。目前已有一万一千五百个合作社响应了这个号召。
        全国领先的成绩                                            
    普累罗夫县的农民用实际行动证明了他们是说到做得到的好汉。1959年全县小麦的产量达到了每公顷三十一点九公担的指标，而全国平均产量是每公顷二十二点八公担。菜籽的产量达到每公顷二十点五公担，而全国平均产量是每公顷十四公担。此外，每公顷地产肉二百二十公斤，牛奶九百四十五公升，鸡蛋六百七十二个，而全国平均产量是每公顷产肉一百二十二点五公斤，牛奶五百零一公升，鸡蛋二百八十四个。每头乳牛一年产奶量是二千三百二十五公升，最高的一头达三千一百九十公升。
    热烈的挑战使1959年的产量大大超过了1958年，粮食产量提高了20．7％，牛奶提高了9．1％，鸡蛋增加了20％。这种优异的成绩振奋了普累罗夫县人的心，更引起了全国农村的注意。
    县委派赤拉德尼柯同志陪我们去访问了县里的两个合作社。赤拉德尼柯同志是在两个月前从军队的政治工作岗位下放到县里来工作半年的。他还保留着军人的严谨作风，说话不多，然而不时流露出他对于新环境、新工作的喜悦。他说，在县里，和群众接近，能得到很多锻炼。
    虽然还不断下雪，气候还未转暖，但合作社里的春耕准备工作已展开了，有的修理拖拉机，有的修理其他农业机械，有的送肥上地。普洛山尼采合作社，这个主动提出向全县合作社挑战的英雄社，由于去年的出色成绩，而获得了全县的流动红旗。合作社主席卡·彼德尔华日同志原是个铁路工人，五年前为了支援农业，主动报名到农村工作。彼德尔华日同志已五十多岁，朴实可亲，热爱农村工作。甚至社里的小马小牛也是他的亲密的朋友，他抚摸它们，它们向着他摇头摆尾。今年1月份，普洛山尼采合作社乳牛的每日平均乳产量达八点三公升，超额完成任务零点三公升。
    班赤采合作社的猪栏和牛厩也特别清洁，而且是阳光充足、温暖如春。这里牲畜饮水的设备已经自动化了，搬运饲料和牛的粪便也都是半机械化的。女社员们推着装有滑轮可盛一、二百斤的大铁斗，沿着悬空的铁轨，忙碌地进进出出。六个女社员管理着七十头乳牛和做挤奶工作。这个牛奶场去年平均每头乳牛产奶量达到三千一百七十九公升（每天每头平均产乳达八点七公升），创造了全县的最高纪录，在全州取得了第二名。这里的一位名叫哈戈娃的女社员，去年一年工作了八百六十五个劳动日。她兴奋地告诉我们，她将在下个月参加普累罗夫县的一个代表团，第二次去布拉格见诺沃提尼同志，向他报捷。
            党和合作化
    普累罗夫县取得这样突出的成绩，原因何在呢？县委第一书记哈依德尔明确而坚定地回答了这个问题：一靠党的领导，二靠合作化。普累罗夫县有着强大的党组织，全县农村人口三万人，有党员六百多人。1957年，全县农村中只有七十名党员，由于他们十分重视农村中党组织的发展，近两年来党的组织迅速地壮大了。县的各级党组织研究农业中的每一个重要问题。县委会还经常派干部下乡，深入劳动人民，帮助合作社发动群众，做政治工作。当前，党组织在思想工作方面，着重在反对残留在农民身上的小生产者的资产阶级意识，以及保守、宗教迷信等。合作化体现了巨大的优越性，经过几次合并，规模越来越大的合作社在完成许多艰巨的土壤改良、清理几万米长的抽水管、修建灌溉、排水工程等方面，显示出了威力。而人民群众的干劲写下了普累罗夫县这页光辉的历史。
    虽然只有短短的两天，我们和普累罗夫县的人们已经像久别重逢的老朋友，无论是县委会的同志、合作社主席、党委会主席、种甜菜的能手或是挤奶员，都对中国感到极大的兴趣。几乎随时可以听到他们对我国农业生产单位面积高产的赞叹。有的人热情地询问中国农民在组织人民公社后的工作和生活情况，并要我们转达他们对中国农民的问候。
