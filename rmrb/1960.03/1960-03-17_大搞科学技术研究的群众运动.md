Launch a Mass Movement for Scientific and Technological Research
　　Zhai Wen
　　Since the Great Leap Forward, scientific and technological work, under the glorious light of the Party's General Line, has been advancing at a tremendous pace, just like other endeavors. A great situation in which the entire population is engaged in science and technology has now emerged. The emergence of this great situation is not accidental; it is the inevitable product of the continued and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the national economy. To accelerate socialist construction and change our country's "poor and blank" state as quickly as possible is the urgent desire of the people nationwide. The leaps and bounds in industrial and agricultural production demand that the development of scientific and technological work be accelerated even further. The high-speed development of industry and agriculture does not allow scientific and technological work to proceed at a slow pace. From industry to agriculture, from popularization to improvement, from the general to the advanced, from application to theory, from research to promotion, from the present to the long-term, a series of scientific and technological problems all require everyone to take action to solve them. Because the great socialist construction practice has forcefully demonstrated that accelerating the development of science and technology is one of the important conditions for accelerating the development of the national economy. Failure to accelerate the development of science and technology will affect the accelerated development of industry and agriculture. The situation is pressing, and it is necessary for the entire population to engage in science and technology and for everyone to take action to solve the scientific and technological problems raised in production in order to meet the requirements of socialist construction. Therefore, once the Party issued the call, with the nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution entering a new high tide, a heartening new situation emerged in which the entire Party grasped science and the entire population engaged in science. Scientific and technological activities are no longer the activities of a few scientific and technical workers; they have become a vigorous mass movement. Scientific and technological activities have been launched from factories, enterprises, and schools all the way down to the most basic levels in rural areas. Scientific and technical workers are no longer conducting research behind closed doors; they have begun to delve into production and combine with mass scientific and technological activities. This excellent situation has laid a very good foundation for an even greater leap forward in scientific and technological work.
　　Whether science and technology should and could develop at a high speed has long been a matter of debate. The focus of the debate is: whether or not to implement the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs in scientific and technological work. Some scientists whose bourgeois ideology has not been transformed have asserted that it is unnecessary and impossible to implement the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs in scientific and technological work. We, on the other hand, believe that in scientific and technological work, as in other work, it is necessary and possible to implement the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs. Because the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs are the line that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of Chinese construction, it centrally reflects the demands and aspirations of the Chinese people, is entirely in line with the objective laws of our country's economic development, and is also entirely in line with the objective laws of our country's scientific and technological development. The soul of the Party's General Line is to strive for high speed; implementing the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs can develop science and technology at a high speed. Without the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs, there is, of course, no way to talk about high speed. From this point of view, the debate about whether scientific and technological work can develop at a high speed is a question of whether or not to have the general line of socialist construction. This debate is essentially a struggle between two roads, two lines, and two worldviews.
　　Those scientists whose bourgeois ideology has not been transformed have always chanted "science for the sake of science" in the past. They regard science and technology as the business of a few people, which the broad masses of workers and peasants cannot and are not allowed to aspire to. They clothe science and technology in a mysterious cloak, making it elusive and unpredictable, and deterring people from getting involved. They do not recognize that science and technology are produced and developed on the basis of people's production practice activities. They also generally do not recognize the truth of what Chairman Mao said: "Man's productive activity is the most fundamental practical activity, it is the thing that determines all other activities," and "Man's social practice in production is gradually developing from a lower to a higher level, and so is man's knowledge, whether of nature or of society, gradually developing from a lower to a higher level." They despise production practice and regard the masses as blind. They believe that in science and technology, one can only listen to the words of experts and scholars, not to the words of the masses; one can only follow the expert line, not the mass line. They believe that scientific research can only be carried out in the laboratory, not in the battle to extract wealth from nature. If science and technology face practice and serve practice, then the dignity of scientific and technological work will be lost. Therefore, they believe that it is a joke to implement the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs in scientific and technological work. They say that science is science, and science cannot solve problems by shouting "go all out;" scientific problems cannot be solved by shock tactics or by relying on the masses. Therefore, they do not know where to start when it comes to achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. So they regard mass scientific and technological activities as purely "nonsense," and they regard the miracles created by the masses as unscientific. The facts of the continued Great Leap Forward in scientific and technological work over the past two years have shattered their views, proving that the Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest of science and technology are the result of implementing the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs, and that it is the result of replacing the expert line with the Party's mass line. Facts show that by holding high the red flag of the Party's General Line and launching a mass movement for scientific and technological research, science and technology can develop continuously and at a high speed. The continuous and high-speed development of science and technology will, in turn, promote the mass movement of scientific and technological research to become more in-depth and more extensive. It will also further break down superstitions, further liberate thinking, dare to think what one did not dare to think, make what one thought was impractical practical, and make what one could not do able to do. In this way, the speed of scientific and technological development is getting higher and higher, and a large number of native experts are appearing. New technological directions are also constantly emerging in native technologies. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, the masses not only want to solve the general technical problems raised in production practice, but also, encouraged by the spirit of continuous revolution, want to climb the peaks of science and technology and solve problems in the high-precision and cutting-edge fields. Their bold words are: "We must have what the world has, and we must also create what the world does not have." The call to catch up with the world's most advanced scientific level has penetrated people's hearts and become a powerful material force. This is the greatest victory in the cause of science and technology.
　　Today, we have entered the 1960s with full confidence, and the second and more glorious decade of our country has begun. The 1960s are a great era, and a great future is beckoning us. We shoulder a great mission. Although the situation of continuous leap forward in scientific and technological work has been formed, and the excellent situation of the entire Party grasping science and the entire population engaging in science has emerged, the development of scientific and technological work is not only very incompatible with the requirements of the great future, but also incompatible with the requirements of current industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, we must earnestly accept the experience of the past two years, further recognize the significance of boldly mobilizing the masses and launching a mass movement for scientific and technological research, strive for a higher speed of development of scientific and technological work, and complete the great tasks assigned to scientific and technological work by the great era. We must not only accept the most fundamental experience of the past two years, but more importantly, further develop the past experience in the new situation, so that the mass movement of scientific and technological research can develop more vigorously and rapidly move from victory to greater victory.
　　The issue of boldly mobilizing the masses is not simply a matter of method, but first and foremost a matter of position and point of view. This has been fully demonstrated in the struggle between the two roads, two lines, and two worldviews since the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, to boldly mobilize the masses, we must establish the view that "history is created by the people" and deeply understand that "the working class must rely on the mass strength of its own class and the mass strength of the entire working people in order to realize its historical mission—to liberate itself and at the same time liberate the entire working people. The more the awareness, initiative, and creativity of the masses develop, the more the cause of the working class develops." We must regard all undertakings as the cause of the masses, and the cause of science and technology is no exception. This great cause must also rely on the strength of the masses to complete it. But to recognize this problem requires not only hard political and ideological work outside the Party, but also hard political and ideological work within the Party. Therefore, the central issue of boldly mobilizing the masses is how to mobilize the masses ideologically, that is, to expose ideological contradictions and solve ideological problems. The process of ideological mobilization can also be said to be a process of ideological struggle, and it is a complex process of ideological struggle. In the middle of this, there is both a struggle between two roads and a struggle between advanced and backward ideas. We must follow Chairman Mao's theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people, distinguish the nature of contradictions, and correctly solve them. Through the continuous Great Leap Forward in scientific and technological work over the past two years, everyone has been deeply educated. Experts, scholars, and scientific workers, in general, have also made progress to varying degrees. There are not many people who firmly oppose the mass movement of scientific and technological research now, and there are even fewer who openly resist the mass movement. But it cannot be said that the struggle between the two roads, two lines, and two worldviews on the issue of developing science and technology has been resolved. The fact is not so. The ideological transformation of scientific and technical workers is a long-term and tortuous process, and it is by no means a problem that can be solved overnight. In fact, there are still struggles on the road, methods, and speed of scientific and technological development. Some people still believe that scientific and technological work cannot develop at a high speed, and that mass movements can only solve local and general technical problems, not large and foreign scientific and technological problems. They do not recognize the dialectical relationship between large and small, local and foreign, general and advanced, theory and practice. They are always skeptical that local can lead to foreign, small can lead to large, low can lead to high, general can lead to advanced, and production practice can raise a large number of theoretical requirements. To further boost their enthusiasm in the mass movement of scientific and technological research and enable them to play a greater role, we must further solve their ideological problems through the practice of science and technology. We must make them consciously fight against the idealistic and metaphysical viewpoint that ignores the role of practice and cannot see that the masses are the ocean of wisdom. We must make them further face practice, delve into the masses, and throw themselves into the magnificent mass movement. We must combine the scientific and technological activities of scientific research institutions, universities, and factories and enterprises with the scientific and technological activities of people's communes to truly form a communist collaboration. We must combine the special research of experts with the scientific and technological activities of the masses, apply the results of special research to production practice in a timely manner, and summarize the creations of the masses in a timely manner and explain them theoretically. Within a department, it is also necessary to combine the activities of full-time scientific and technical workers with the activities of the masses under the leadership of the Party. Through vivid practice and through combination with the masses, greater achievements will inevitably be made, which will gradually overcome their views of neglecting practice and despising the masses. This will enable them to continuously overcome, continuously move forward, and continuously improve their revolutionary consciousness, and advance towards the road of both red and expert. For the broad masses, the main thing is to break down superstitions, liberate thinking, establish lofty ambitions, improve the style of communism, eliminate feelings of inferiority, and make them recognize the truth that the masses are the creators of history, and dare to be the masters of science and technology. All kinds of ideological problems raised among them, whether it is the idea of living according to the old rules and the old ways, the idea of being superstitious about the past and not believing that new things will surely win, the idea of fearing that technical innovation and technical revolution will change the original habits and cause problems, or the idea of thinking that they are incompetent, daring not to participate in technical innovation and technical revolution and waiting to enjoy the fruits of others' victories, should be boldly handed over to the masses to solve themselves. We must be sure that the masses will solve the problems they raise themselves. It should also be seen that ideological problems cannot be solved completely. When old contradictions are solved, new contradictions will appear. Without contradictions, there would be no development of things. All things develop from the struggle of contradictions. To make the movement of scientific and technological innovation and revolution more comprehensive, more in-depth, and more universal, we must hold high the red flag of continuous revolution, constantly and boldly mobilize the masses, constantly break down superstitions, constantly liberate thinking, and constantly solve the ideological problems raised, so that the masses, under the brilliant light of the General Line, always maintain vigorous revolutionary energy and stride forward to the peak of science.
　　To further boldly mobilize the masses and launch a mass movement for scientific and technological research, we must strengthen the Party's centralized and unified leadership. Boldly mobilizing the masses and the Party's centralized and unified leadership are dialectical relationships. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," written after summarizing the rich experience of our Party's mass line, raised this to the height of dialectical materialist epistemology and gave a brilliant exposition. In this article, he wrote: "In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses. This means that the opinions of the masses (scattered and unsystematic opinions) are concentrated (after research, they are transformed into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then they are disseminated and explained to the masses, transformed into the opinions of the masses, so that the masses persist in them, put them into action, and test whether these opinions are correct in the actions of the masses. Finally, they are concentrated again from the masses and then persisted in by the masses. This cycle is infinite, and each time it is more correct, more vivid, and more abundant. This is the Marxist epistemology." This tells us that to make the mass movement develop healthily, we must use the leadership method of the mass line, that is, we must not only dare to mobilize the masses, but also strengthen the leadership of the mass movement, be good at concentrating, and persist. Only by strengthening leadership and concentrating the scattered and unsystematic opinions of the masses can we form correct guidelines and policies for guiding the movement, and can the mass movement develop healthily and vigorously under correct guidance. The strong desire of the masses is reflected in the leadership, which will also enhance the determination of the leadership and make the leadership more boldly mobilize the masses. "Mechanization, electrification, cannot be achieved without science," and "Tractors and seeders cannot be driven without technology." These are the problems raised by the masses from practice, which shows that being the master of science is the strong desire of the masses. Boldly mobilizing the masses and launching a mass movement for science and technology reflects the strong desire of the masses and points out the correct direction for the development of science and technology. In order to strengthen the Party's centralized and unified leadership, it is necessary to go deep into the masses to understand their ideological problems, concentrate these ideological problems, and solve them. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the new things and new seedlings that appear in the practice of scientific and technological activities by the masses, and these new things and new seedlings should be concentrated and promoted among the masses to make them bloom and bear fruit. In this way, we will boldly mobilize the masses step by step and concentrate the problems of the masses to solve them, and under the guidance of the thought of continuous revolution, we will constantly push the mass movement of scientific and technological research to a higher stage. Such a mass movement will become a continuous movement.
　　In the mass movement of scientific and technological research, the most energetic, determined, ambitious, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to climb the peak of science are mostly young Party members, League members, and activists. They are the vanguards in technical innovation and technical revolution. They do not have much knowledge and experience, but they are very ambitious, adhere to the revolution, and are the backbone of the mass movement. New experts have emerged among them, and more experts will emerge in the future. They are an important source of the large and red and expert scientific and technical team needed for national construction. In the mass movement of scientific and technological research, this part of the new force must be supported and encouraged in all aspects with a warm attitude. In the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, the issue of valuing new forces has been given attention. The situation in which young Party members, League members, and activists were suppressed has undergone fundamental changes. The truth that the younger generation is better than the older generation has been recognized by most people, but it does not mean that there are no problems in the growth of new forces. It must be seen that their growth must inevitably go through tortuous and complex struggles. We must firmly stand on the proletarian position and support their growth. We must resolutely support their reasonable creations and bold innovations. We must help them analyze the reasons and overcome the setbacks they encounter in the research process. We must encourage them to overcome all difficulties in their advance with greater enthusiasm and greater confidence. We must make them realize that scientific and technological work is an exploratory activity that replaces the old with the new. Since it is exploration, there is a possibility of quick success, and there is also a possibility of success after several failures and repeated research. Since it is replacing the old with the new, the struggle between new and old ideas will of course run through the entire process. Therefore, we must further boost our energy, strive for the top, work hard, talk less and do more, and use revolutionary practical actions to overcome all difficulties, and truly make all difficulties a driving force for forging ahead, and truly achieve despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically. This issue must be further systematically resolved in the mass movement of scientific and technological research. If this issue is not resolved, the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do cannot be further promoted, and the movement cannot form a strong backbone force, and it cannot always maintain a vigorous and lively atmosphere. A vigorous and lively atmosphere is an indispensable heat in the movement.
　　The problems in the mass movement of scientific and technological research are of course not limited to these. Such as holding high the red flag, setting up models, holding on-site meetings, exhibitions, etc., are all important issues in leading the mass movement. But all problems are summed up to whether or not Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line are in command. As long as we raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the red flag of the General Line higher, and arm the masses with the communist thought of continuous revolution, the movement will be higher than a wave and one victory after another. The high-speed development of scientific and technological work will become inevitable.

    大搞科学技术研究的群众运动
    翟文
    大跃进以来，科学技术工作，在党的总路线的光辉
  照耀下，和其他工作一样，也是在一日千里的向前迈进
  着。现在一个全民办科学技术的大好形势已经出现。这
  个大好形势的出现，并不是偶然的，它是国民经济继续全面大跃进的必然产物。加速社会主义建设，尽快地改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌，是全国人民的迫切愿望。工农业生产的跃进再跃进，要求科学技术工作的发展加速再加速。工农业的高速度发展，不允许科学技术工作慢步前进。从工业到农业，从普及到提高，从一般到尖端，从应用到理论，从研究到推广，从当前到长远，一系列的科学技术问题，都要求大家动手解决。因为伟大的社会主义建设实践，已经有力的说明，加速发展科学技术，是加速发展国民经济的重要条件之一。不加速科学技术的发展，就会影响到工农业的加速发展，形势逼人，必须全民办科学技术，大家动手解决生产中提出的科学技术问题，才能适应社会主义建设的要求。所以一经党的号召，随着全民性的技术革新和技术革命进入新的高潮，也就出现了振奋人心的全党抓科学全民办科学的新形势。科学技术活动再不是少数科学技术工作者的活动，已经成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动，从工厂、企业、学校一直到农村的最基层都开展了科学技术活动。科学技术工作者再不是关门进行研究，他们开始深入生产，和群众性的科学技术活动结合起来。这个大好形势，为科学技术工作的更大跃进奠定了很好的基础。
    科学技术要不要和能不能高速度的发展，长期以来都是有争论的，争论的焦点是：在科学技术工作中，要不要和能不能贯彻执行党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针。有一些资产阶级思想没有得到改造的科学家，认定在科学技术工作上不必要贯彻执行党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，也无法贯彻执行党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针。我们则认定在科学技术工作上，和其他工作一样，必须贯彻执行党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，也能够贯彻执行。因为党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国建设的具体实践相结合的路线，它集中地反映了中国人民的要求和愿望，是完全合乎我国经济发展的客观规律的，也完全合乎我国科学技术发展的客观规律的。党的总路线的灵魂就是力争高速度；贯彻执行了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，就能高速度的发展科学技术，离开了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，当然就谈不到高速度。由此看来，科学技术工作能不能高速度发展的争论是要不要社会主义建设总路线的问题，这种争论本质上是两条道路，两种路线，两种世界观的斗争。
    那些资产阶级思想没有得到改造的科学家，他们过去一向是高唱“为科学而科学”的，他们把科学技术视为少数人的事业，广大的工农群众是不能高攀也是不许高攀的。他们给科学技术披上神秘的外衣，使人迷离莫测，不敢问津。他们不承认科学技术是在人们的生产实践活动的基础上产生和发展的。他们对于毛主席所说的：“人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西”，“人类社会的生产活动，是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展，因此，人们的认识，不论对于自然界方面，对于社会方面，也都是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展”的真理，也是一概不承认的。他们轻视生产实践，把群众认为是群盲。他们认为科学技术方面的问题，只能听专家学者的话，不能听群众的话；只能走专家路线，不能走群众路线。他们认为科学研究只能在实验室里进行，不能在投身于向大自然索取财富的战斗中进行，如果科学技术面向实践并为实践服务，那就失去科学技术工作的尊严。因此他们对于在科学技术工作上必须贯彻党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，认为是一种不懂科学技术的笑谈。说什么科学就是科学，科学不能喊一声鼓足干劲就解决问题的，科学问题是既不能突击，也不能依靠群众解决的。因此要多快好省，就更是不知从何说起了。所以他们把群众性的科学技术活动认为纯粹是一种“胡闹”，把群众所创造出来的奇迹，说成是不科学的东西。两年来科学技术工作继续大跃进的事实粉碎了他们的观点，证明了科学技术的大跃进大丰收，就是贯彻执行了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针的结果，就是用党的群众路线代替了专家路线的结果。事实说明，高举党的总路线的红旗，大搞科学技术研究的群众运动，科学技术就可以持续不断地高速度的发展。科学技术持续地高速度发展，又会反过来促进科学技术研究的群众运动更加深入，更加广泛。也就会使人的迷信进一步破除，思想进一步解放，不敢想的敢想了，想的不切实际的实际了，不能干的能干了。这样科学技术发展的速度越来越高了，土生土长的大批专家出现了。在土生土长的技术中，新的技术方向也不断出现了。在总路线的光辉照耀下，群众不仅要解决生产实践中提出的一般技术问题，而且他们在不断革命思想的鼓舞下，要进而攀登科学技术的高峰，要解决高精尖方面的问题。他们的豪语是：“世界上有的东西，我们都要有，世界上没有的东西，我们也要创造出来”。赶上世界最先进科学水平的号召已经深入人心，成为强大的物质力量。这是科学技术事业中最大的胜利。
    今天，我们已经满怀信心地进入二十世纪的六十年代，我们的国家第二个更光辉的十年已经开始了。二十世纪六十年代，是伟大的时代，伟大的未来在向我们召唤，我们肩负着伟大的任务。科学技术工作不断持续跃进的局面虽然已经形成，全党抓科学，全民办科学的大好形势虽然已经出现，但现在科学技术工作的发展，不但和伟大未来的要求是很不相适应的，和当前工农业生产的要求也还是不相适应的。因此，我们必须认真接受过去两年来的经验，进一步认识放手发动群众，大搞科学技术研究群众运动的意义，争取更高速度的发展科学技术工作，完成伟大时代赋与科学技术工作的伟大任务。我们不仅要接受过去两年来最根本的经验，更重要的还是在新的形势下进一步地发展过去的经验，使科学技术研究的群众运动，更蓬勃地发展，迅速地从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    放手发动群众的问题，不单纯是一个方法的问题，首先是一个立场观点的问题。这是已为大跃进以来两条道路、两条路线、两种世界观的斗争中所充分说明了的。所以要放手的发动群众，必须确立“历史是人民群众创造的”观点，深刻地认识“工人阶级必须依靠本阶级的群众力量和全体劳动人民的群众力量，才能实现自己的历史使命——解放自己，同时解放全体劳动人民。群众的觉悟性、积极性、创造性愈是发展，工人阶级的事业就愈是发展”。要把一切的事业，都认为是群众的事业，科学技术事业也毫无例外。这一伟大的事业，也同样要依靠群众的力量去完成。但认识这个问题，不仅需要在党外做艰苦的政治思想工作，在党内同样要进行艰苦的政治思想工作。所以放手发动群众的中心问题，是如何从思想上发动群众的问题，也就是要揭露思想上的矛盾，解决思想上的问题。思想发动的过程，也可以说是思想斗争的过程，而且是复杂的思想斗争过程。这中间既有两条道路的斗争，也有先进思想与落后思想的斗争。必须按照毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论，区分矛盾的性质，正确的加以解决。经过两年来科学技术工作的连续大跃进，所有的人都从中受到了极深刻的教育。专家学者和科学工作者，一般说也都有了不同程度的进步。现在坚决反对科学技术研究的群众运动的人不多了，公开抵抗群众运动的更是少见了。但不能说在发展科学技术问题上两条道路、两种路线、两种世界观的斗争就此已经解决。事实绝不如此。科学技术工作者的思想改造，是长期的、曲折的，绝不是一朝一夕可以解决问题的。事实上，在科学技术发展的道路、方法和速度等问题上，就还是有斗争的。有人在现在还一直认定科学技术工作不能高速度的发展，群众运动只能解决土的和一般的技术问题，不能解决大的和洋的科学技术问题。他们不承认大、小、土、洋，一般和尖端，理论和实践的辩证关系，对由土可以到洋，由小可以到大，由低可以到高，由一般可以到尖端，由生产实践中可以提出大量的理论要求，始终是抱怀疑的。要在大搞科学技术研究的群众运动中，进一步地鼓足他们的干劲，使他们发挥更大的作用，还必须通过科学技术的实践活动，进一步地解决他们的这些思想问题。要使他们自觉的和那种忽视实践作用，看不到群众是智慧的海洋的那种唯心的形而上学的观点作斗争。要使他们进一步面向实践，深入群众，投身到规模壮阔的群众运动中去。要使科学研究机关、高等学校和厂矿企业、人民公社的科学技术活动结合起来，真正形成共产主义的大协作。要将专家的专题研究和群众的科学技术活动结合起来，把专题研究的成果及时运用到生产实践中，把群众的创造及时的加以总结，从理论上给以说明。在一个部门的内部，也必须在党的领导下将专职的科学技术工作者的活动和群众的活动结合起来。通过生动的实践，通过和群众结合，就必然会取得更大的成就，这就能逐步地克服他们忽视实践、轻视群众的观点。使他们能够不断克服、不断前进、不断提高自己的革命自觉性，向又红又专的大道前进。对广大的群众来说，主要是破除迷信，解放思想，树立雄心大志，提高共产主义的风格，消除自卑感，使他们认识群众是历史的创造者的真理，要敢于做科学技术的主人。把他们中间提出的各种各样的思想问题，不管是要按老规矩老样子生活的思想也好，迷信过去，不相信新生事物一定会胜利的思想也好，怕技术革新和技术革命改变了原有的习惯会发生问题的思想也好，或者认为自己无能，不敢参加技术革新和技术革命而等待享受别人胜利成果的思想也好，都应该放手交给群众自己去解决。要确信群众自己提出的问题，自己都会解决。也应当看到思想问题是解决不完的，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会出现。没有矛盾就没有事物的发展，一切事物都是从矛盾斗争中发展的。要使科学技术革新和革命运动更全面、更深入、更普遍地展开，就必须高举不断革命的思想红旗，不断的放手发动群众，不断的破除迷信，不断的解放思想，不断的解决思想上提出的问题，使群众在总路线的光辉照耀下，始终保持旺盛的革命干劲，大踏步地向科学高峰挺进。
    要进一步地放手发动群众，大搞科学技术研究的群众运动，就必须加强党的集中统一的领导。放手发动群众和党的集中统一的领导是辩证的关系。毛泽东同志在总结了我党群众路线丰富的经验以后所写的“关于领导方法的若干问题”中，对此提高到辩证唯物主义的认识论的高度并作了精辟的阐述，他在这篇文章中写道：“在我党的一切实践工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确。最后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确、更生动、更丰富。这就是马克思主义的认识论。”这就告诉我们，要使群众运动健康地发展，必须运用群众路线的领导方法，也就是说不仅要敢于发动群众，而且要加强对群众运动的领导，善于集中起来，又坚持下去。只有加强领导，把群众分散的、无系统的意见集中起来，才能形成正确的指导运动的方针政策，才能使群众运动在正确的指导下得到健康的蓬勃的发展。群众强烈的愿望反映到领导上，也就会增强领导的决心，使领导更放手地去发动群众。“机械化，电气化，没有科学不能化”、“拖拉机，播种机，没有技术不能开”，这是群众从实践中提出来的问题，这说明做科学的主人，是群众强烈的愿望。放手发动群众，大搞科学技术的群众运动，正是反映了群众的这种强烈愿望，为科学技术的发展指出了正确的方向。为了加强党的集中统一的领导，要深入群众了解群众的思想问题，将这些思想问题集中起来，加以解决；同时也要注意群众在科学技术活动实践中出现的新事物新苗头，将这些新事物新苗头集中起来，在群众中加以推广，使其开花结果。这样一步深入一步地放手发动群众，并把群众中的问题集中起来加以解决，在不断革命思想的指导下，不断地将科学技术研究的群众运动推向更高的阶段。这样的群众运动就会成为持续的运动。
    在科学技术研究的群众运动中，干劲足，决心大，志气高，敢想，敢说，敢于攀登科学高峰的，大多数是青年党团员积极分子，他们是技术革新和技术革命中的闯将。他们学问和经验不多，但雄心不小，坚持革命，是群众运动中的骨干。在他们中间已经出现了新的专家，今后将会出现更多的专家。国家建设所需要的一支庞大的又红又专的科学技术队伍，他们是一个重要的来源。在科学技术研究的群众运动中，对这部分新生的力量，必须用满腔热情的态度从各方面加以支持，给以鼓励。在两年来的大跃进中，重视新生力量的问题虽然已引起重视，青年党团员积极分子受压抑的情况已经发生根本的变化，青出于蓝而胜于蓝的真理已为大多数人所承认，但绝不是说，新生力量的成长就没有问题了。必须看到他们的成长还必然要经过曲折的复杂的斗争。我们必须坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，扶植他们的成长。对他们合理的创造和大胆的革新坚决地加以支持。对于他们在研究过程中遇到的挫折，要帮助他们分析原因，加以克服。要鼓励他们以更高的热情更大的信心战胜前进中的一切困难。要使他们认识科学技术工作是一项带有探索性的，以新代旧的活动。既然是探索就有很快成功的可能，也有经过若干次失败反复研究才会成功的可能。既然是以新代旧，在前进途中，新旧思想的斗争，当然会贯彻始终。因此，更要鼓足干劲，力争上游，埋头苦干，少说多干，用革命的实际行动去战胜一切困难，将一切困难都作为奋勇前进的推动力量，真正作到在战略上蔑视困难，在战术上重视困难。这个问题在大搞科学技术研究的群众运动中，必须进一步地系统地解决。不解决这个问题，敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，还不能进一步地发扬，运动就不能形成坚强的骨干力量，也就不能始终保持朝气勃勃、轰轰烈烈的空气，而朝气勃勃、轰轰烈烈的空气，则是运动中不可少的热力。
    放手发动群众，大搞科学技术研究群众运动中的问题，当然不止这些，诸如高举红旗，大树标兵，开现场会，展览会等等，都是在领导群众运动中的重要问题，但所有问题都归结到是不是毛泽东思想和党的总路线挂帅的问题，只要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，总路线的红旗，用共产主义不断革命思想将群众武装起来，运动就会一浪高过一浪，一个胜利接着一个胜利。科学技术工作高速度的发展就成为必然。
