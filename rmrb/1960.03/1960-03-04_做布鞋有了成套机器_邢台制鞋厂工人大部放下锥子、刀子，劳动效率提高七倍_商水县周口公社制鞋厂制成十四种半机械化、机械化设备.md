Xinhua News Agency report: Complete sets of machines are now available for making cloth shoes. In a short period, the Xingtai Shoe Factory in Hebei has created and imitated twenty types of machines for making cloth shoes, such as sole leveling machines, leather strip pulling machines, eye splitting machines, sole stitching machines, shoe stitching machines, and fluffing machines, enabling the mechanization and semi-mechanization of seventeen major processes out of twenty-one. 82% of the factory's workers stood up from their small stools, put down their awls, hammers, and knives, and switched to machine production, generally increasing labor efficiency by about seven times. With the introduction of the sole cutting machine, two people can handle all the sole cutting tasks, thus eliminating a fifty-person sole cutting workshop. Their innovation has broken the superstitious and conservative ideas that have always held that "three treasures in the shoemaker's hands – needle, awl, and clamp are indispensable" and "manual operation is the right way, thinking about using machines is just nonsense."

In the process of realizing mechanized production, this factory resolutely implemented the principles of self-reliance, making do with whatever is available, indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. If there was no milling machine, they used hand files; if there was no punch press, they used hand drills. More than 90% of the factory's equipment materials were made from waste materials, and all the self-made equipment cost only 3,400 yuan, achieving low cost, short time, and great results.

The quality and durability of machine-made shoes can match the best level of hand-made shoes. The Xingtai Shoe Factory once sent shoes to the Fengfeng Coal Mine for the workers to try on. When the coal miners who had tried them on bought shoes again, they specifically requested the machine-made shoes from the Xingtai Shoe Factory. Currently, the Xingtai Shoe Factory has produced more than 700,000 pairs of cloth shoes with machines, which have been sold to more than a dozen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Taiyuan, Henan, and Shaanxi.

The Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Commerce recently held a national on-site conference on the mechanization of cloth shoe production at the Xingtai Shoe Factory to promote their advanced experience. The conference called on the national cloth shoe industry to strive to basically achieve mechanized and semi-mechanized production within two to three years.

This newspaper reports: Employees of the Zhoukou Commune Shoe Factory in Shangshui County, Henan Province, through self-reliance and vigorous technological innovation and revolution, have transformed shoe making from completely manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized production. Currently, the entire factory has successfully manufactured fourteen types of more than twenty semi-mechanized and mechanized tools and equipment, such as edge folding machines, upper cutting machines, and three-in-one shoe brushing, strip pressing, and automatic edge rolling machines, thread end trimming machines, mixed upper and sole leveling machines, and electric sewing machines, and all have been put into production. Twenty workshops, including upper making, sole making, upper attaching, sole nailing, and thread joining, have basically achieved mechanized operation, greatly improving production efficiency, reducing labor intensity, and lowering costs. For example, using an edge folding machine increases production from 15 pairs folded by one person per day to 300 pairs; the leveling machine increased efficiency fifty-fold compared to manual work, freeing up forty laborers with this single improvement.

Workers at the Cangxian Shoe Factory in Hebei Province have made forty-five types of machines and tools, such as cutting machines and sole stitching machines, replacing fifty-seven manual operations, and beginning to get rid of heavy labor such as hand stitching, foot pedaling, and shoulder carrying. Production efficiency has increased by an average of five times compared to the past, and costs have been reduced by 30%.

Right picture: Now, using a wooden sole cutting machine, he can cut 500 pairs a day.

    做布鞋有了成套机器
    邢台制鞋厂工人大部放下锥子、刀子，劳动效率提高七倍
    商水县周口公社制鞋厂制成十四种半机械化、机械化设备
    据新华社讯　做布鞋也有成套的机器了。河北邢台制鞋厂在短时期内，先后创造和仿制出平底机、拉皮条机、分眼机、纳底机、纳鞋机、打毛机等二十种做布鞋的机器，使二十一道工序中有十七道主要工序实现了机械化和半机械化。全厂有82％的工人从小凳子上站起来，放下锥子、锤子和刀子，改用机器生产，劳动效率一般提高七倍左右。由于有了裁底机，两个人就可以担负全部裁底任务，因而取消了一个五十人的裁底车间。他们的革新事例，破除了从来认为“鞋匠手中三件宝，针锥夹板离不了”、“手工操作是正道，想用机器是瞎胡闹”的迷信保守思想。
    这个工厂在实现机械化生产的过程中，坚决贯彻了自力更生、因陋就简、土法上马、土洋结合的方针，没有铣床用手锉，没有冲床用手钻。这个厂90％以上的设备用料都是利用废料，全部自制的设备仅用了三千四百元，做到花钱少，时间短，收效大。
    机器做鞋的质量和结实程度，可以赶上手工制鞋最优等的水平。邢台制鞋厂曾把鞋子送到峰峰煤矿请工人们试穿，试穿过的煤矿工人再买鞋的时候，都指定要邢台制鞋厂的机制鞋。现在，邢台制鞋厂用机器制出的七十多万双布鞋，已经销售到北京、太原、河南、陕西等十几个省市。
    轻工业部和商业部最近在邢台制鞋厂召开全国布鞋生产机械化现场会议，推广他们的先进经验。会议号召全国布鞋业，力争在两三年内，基本上实现机械化半机械化生产。
    本报讯　河南商水县周口公社制鞋厂的职工，自力更生大搞技术革新和技术革命，使做鞋由全部手工操作变为机械化、半机械化生产。目前，全厂已制造成功了揙口机、切帮机和刷鞋、压条、自动卷边三用机、啃线头机、平帮平底混合机、电动缝纫机等十四种二十多部半机械化、机械化工具设备，并全部投入了生产。制帮、制底、上帮、钉底、合线等二十个车间基本上实现了机械化操作，大大提高了生产效率，减轻了劳动强度，降低了成本。如用揙口机揙口，就由原手工操作时一人一天揙口十五双，提高到三百双；平底机代替手工以后，提高工效五十倍，仅这一项就腾出四十个劳动力。
