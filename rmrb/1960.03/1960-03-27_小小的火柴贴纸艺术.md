    Tiny Matchbox Label Art
    Hua Junwu
    This year, the woodcut artists in Chongqing, Sichuan, have once again done something very meaningful: they have created a set of matchbox labels for the Chongqing Light Industry Bureau's match factory. The content includes ten kinds of images that make up the new face of Chongqing, such as Comrade Zhou Enlai and the Party Committee's office during the Anti-Japanese War - Hongyan Village, the newly built Yangtze River Bridge and Beiyu Highway, the scenery of the new industrial zone along the Yangtze River after liberation, and the new cable car in Chongqing. There is also a set with the theme of technological revolution, showing the image of workers in industrial construction and the new look of technological innovation. The compositions of these woodcuts are very neat, the themes are prominent, the colors are rich, and they have high artistic value. The woodcut artists in Chongqing are also preparing to carve new matchbox labels successively during important political movements and festivals in the future, so that woodcuts can serve politics and industry and release a new flower. Matches are widely used, and using a small box of matches can achieve political propaganda and beautify people's lives, which is of great significance. The woodcut artists in Chongqing have followed up the creation of "New Chongqing Stationery" last year and made this work with full enthusiasm, which is very gratifying. Therefore, I would like to introduce it to readers.
    The comrades engaged in this work are the woodcut artists Li Shaoyan, Niu Wen, Feng Zhongtie, Li Huanmin, Song Guangxun, Zheng Wei, Wu Fan, Fu Wenshu, Huang Xuanzhi, Wu Qiangnian, Xu Kuang, and Long Fumin.

    小小的火柴贴纸艺术
    华君武
    四川重庆的木刻家们今年又做了一件很有意义的事情，他们为重庆市轻工业局火柴厂创作了一套火柴盒的贴纸。内容有抗战时期周恩来同志和党委办事处所在地——红岩村，有新建的长江大桥和碚渝公路，有解放后长江沿岸的新工业区风景和重庆市的新缆车等十种，构成了重庆新貌这一组画。还有一组是以技术革命为题材，表现了工业建设中的工人形象和技术革新的新面目。这些木刻的构图都很工整，主题突出，色彩丰富，有很高的艺术性。重庆的木刻家们还准备在今后的重要政治运动中和节日中陆续刻出新的火柴贴纸，这样就使木刻为政治、为工业服务又放出一朵新花。火柴的用途极广，利用小小的一盒火柴，既能做到政治宣传，又美化了人民的生活，它的意义是很大的。重庆的木刻家们继去年“重庆新笺谱”的创作之后，鼓足干劲又做了这一件工作，是十分令人高兴的。因此我想介绍给读者们。
    从事这件工作的是木刻家李少言、牛文、鄷中铁、李唤民、宋广训、正威、吴凡、傅文淑、黄玄之、吴强年、徐匡、龙辅民等十二位同志。
