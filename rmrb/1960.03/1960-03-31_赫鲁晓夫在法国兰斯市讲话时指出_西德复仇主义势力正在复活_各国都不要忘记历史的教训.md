Xinhua News Agency, March 30th -- TASS News: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev and his entourage continued their visit to various parts of France on the 29th. In the morning, they flew from Dijon to Metz. In front of the Dijon provincial government building, a large group of enthusiastic Dijon citizens braved the heavy rain to bid farewell to Khrushchev.

At the Metz airport, Khrushchev was welcomed by Jean Laporte, the governor of the Moselle province, General Lecocq, commander of the French Sixth Military Region, and other officials. Then, they took a car from the airport to visit Verdun. In the afternoon, Khrushchev visited Reims, the capital of the Champagne province. Thousands of citizens of Reims warmly welcomed the head of the Soviet government. Many people gathered in front of the city hall, shouting slogans like "Long Live Franco-Soviet Friendship!" The pouring rain did not disperse the welcoming crowd.

Subsequently, a luncheon was held at the Reims City Hall to host the head of the Soviet government, Khrushchev. Minister of State Jacquinot first delivered a speech, warmly welcoming Khrushchev. Khrushchev spoke at the banquet.

Jacquinot vaguely said that Metz, Reims, and Verdun, which Nikita Sergeyevich is visiting today, have been invaded by foreign aggressors more than once and have repelled them.

Khrushchev asked: Who carried out the aggression? Maybe I didn't hear it, who did you repel the attack from?

Jacquinot said: We repelled the attacks of the enemies we opposed together with you.

Khrushchev asked: But who is this anonymous aggressor?

Jacquinot explained: Metz, Reims, and other French cities have suffered from our neighbors, suffered from their aggression, suffered from German aggression.

Khrushchev said: Now it is clear. Life is impartial, it can raise questions that cannot be avoided.

Khrushchev said, we have come to your country to restore the good traditions that have historically formed between our two countries. We are willing to be friendly with you, most sincerely friendly. Historical experience teaches us that when our two countries fought side by side against a common enemy to defend ourselves, we were always the victors in the struggle. German aggression against France is not a fabrication, but a historical fact. Our country has suffered two German invasions. We will not forget this fact.

He said, Mr. Jacquinot, please forgive me, I am now debating with you. Although you talked about the aggressors who invaded France three times, you, it seems, are unwilling to offend them, unwilling to let them have bad feelings towards you. Are you doing this to encourage a fourth invasion?

Khrushchev said, we want peace. But peace cannot be begged for, peace must be won through struggle, to have peace one must fight against the aggressors. We cannot forget the mad attacks of the German militarists on the Soviet Union. We hope that all peace-loving people will unite against new aggression, so that such aggression will never happen again.

Khrushchev continued, I frankly say that we are not afraid of aggression, we can stop aggressors from coming to us with our own strength. If the aggressors still attempt to attack us, then we will take measures so that the aggressors cannot even think like this again, or so that they lose the opportunity to exist. Let us unite, not to wage war against the Germans, but to let the German militarists know that neither the Soviet Union, France, nor any other country can be invaded. Let us unite to guarantee a good life in the world, to create equal conditions for the people of all countries.

Khrushchev continued, but we cannot close our eyes to the facts, Adenauer recently openly said in Rome that God has entrusted the mission of saving Europe to the Germans, we cannot tolerate such remarks, because it has the smell of the "theory" concocted by Hitler, which said that the Germans are God's chosen people and the people of other countries should serve them.

Khrushchev said, I hope that the national leaders of all countries will never forget the lessons of history when formulating their policies, and will not let our descendants blame us for not learning the lessons and for condoning those enemies who have invaded France and our country more than once, enabling them to launch aggressive attacks again. You know, now, in West Germany, revanchist forces are reviving. This cannot but make us feel uneasy. The West German Bundeswehr is demanding atomic weapons. Now, West Germany is your ally. And we and you were allies against Germany in the two previous world wars, but now we are opposed to each other. All this should be carefully considered.

The West German government is doing everything possible to hinder the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. I think that no sane person can explain to me - at least I cannot understand this - that in order to consolidate peace, the remnants of the Second World War should be retained. Whoever does not want to extinguish these embers is trying to ignite the flames of a new war.

We will now and in the future make every effort to get others to understand our policies, to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. I say again, we will all work towards this. If our peaceful policies are not understood by the Western countries, then we will have to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev said, French friends! Let us be friendly, let us work together to fight for peace! If the friendship between France and the Soviet Union and other peace-loving people of all countries is consolidated, then no one in Europe will make calls in favor of war.

After the luncheon, Khrushchev and his entourage visited the Notre Dame Cathedral in Reims, and then traveled by car to Épernay, the center of French champagne production. Khrushchev was warmly welcomed by thousands of citizens when he arrived in Épernay. Khrushchev visited the cellars of the famous Moët & Chandon winery, which has a history of 217 years. After visiting Épernay, Khrushchev returned to Reims and attended a reception held by the Reims City Council for Khrushchev.

In the evening of the 29th, Khrushchev and his entourage left Reims by special train to visit Lille, the largest industrial center in northern France. When Khrushchev arrived in Lille, he was warmly welcomed by crowds gathered in the station square and nearby streets, who gave Khrushchev a storm of cheers. At the train station, Comrade Khrushchev was welcomed by the Governor of Nord and representatives of the municipal authorities.

The motorcade slowly drove through the sea of people and Franco-Soviet national flags towards the Lille Provincial Government. The rainy weather did not prevent many delegations from the Lille working-class districts from expressing their feelings to the envoys of the Soviet people.

In front of the provincial government building, the head of the Soviet government was welcomed by the Governor of Nord and his wife. Khrushchev walked between two rows of miners dressed in white uniforms and holding mine lamps. This was a guard of honor to welcome the head of government of a great friendly country who had once been a miner. Khrushchev warmly greeted them, shook hands with them and talked to them.

In the evening, the head of the Soviet government attended a banquet held for him at the Nord Provincial Government.

On the morning of the 30th, Khrushchev and his entourage left Lille. Along the way, they passed through Roubaix to visit the two industrial cities of Wattrelos and Marcq-en-Barœul. After arriving in Wattrelos, they visited a wool weaving factory. In this factory, a group of female workers performed the Russian song "My Moscow" for the Soviet guests.

    赫鲁晓夫在法国兰斯市讲话时指出
    西德复仇主义势力正在复活  各国都不要忘记历史的教训
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员29日继续在法国各地进行访问。上午，他们乘飞机离开第戎前往梅斯。在第戎省府大厦门前，一大群热情的第戎市民冒着大雨来同赫鲁晓夫告别。
    在梅斯机场上，赫鲁晓夫受到摩泽尔省省长让·拉波特、法国第六军区司令列科克将军和其他官员的欢迎。接着，就乘车从机场前往凡尔登参观。下午，赫鲁晓夫到香巴尼省首府兰斯进行访问。兰斯市数千市民热烈欢迎苏联政府首脑。市政厅门前聚集了许多人，他们高呼着“法苏友谊万岁！”的口号。倾盆大雨也没有使欢迎的人群走散。
    接着，在兰斯市政厅举行了招待苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫的午宴。国务部长雅基诺首先致词，热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫。赫鲁晓夫在宴会上讲了话。
    雅基诺含糊地说，尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇今天访问的麦次、兰斯、凡尔登曾不只一次地遭到外国侵略者的侵犯并击退了他们。
    赫鲁晓夫问道：是谁进行侵略？可能我没有听见，你们击退了谁的进攻？
    雅基诺说：击退了我们和你们一同反对过的敌人的进攻。
    赫鲁晓夫问：可是谁是这个匿名的侵略者呢？
    雅基诺解释说：麦次、兰斯和其他法国城市曾遭到我们的邻居的害，遭到他的侵犯，遭到德国的侵略。
    赫鲁晓夫说：现在清楚了。生活是铁面无私的，它可以提出不能回避的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们到你们国家里来是为了恢复我们两国之间在历史上形成的良好的传统。我们愿意和你们友好，最真挚地友好。历史的经验教导我们，当我们两国并肩同共同敌人作战保卫我们自己的时候，我们总是斗争的胜利者。德国进攻法国这不是捏造，而是历史事实。我们的国家已遭到了德国的两次进攻。我们不会忘记这一事实。
    他说，雅基诺先生，请原谅我，我现在同您进行辩论。您虽然谈到三次进攻法国的侵略者，但是您，好像不愿意得罪他们，不让他们对你们产生恶感。您这样做是不是在鼓励第四次进攻呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们希望和平。但是和平是不能祈求的，和平是必须用斗争来争取的，要和平就必须同侵略者进行斗争。我们不能忘记德国军国主义者对苏联的疯狂进攻。我们希望一切爱好和平的人民团结起来反对新的侵略，使这种侵略今后不再发生。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，我坦率地说，我们不怕侵略，我们用自己的力量可以制止侵略者到我们这里来。如果侵略者仍然企图进攻我们，那末，我们将采取措施，使侵略者今后甚至再不能这样想，或者使他们失去存在的机会。让我们团结起来，不是为了对德国人战争，而是为了让德国军国主义者知道，无论是对苏联、法国、还是对其他国家都不能进犯。让我们团结起来，保证世界上的美好生活，为各国人民创造平等的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，但是，我们不能闭眼不看事实，阿登纳不久前在罗马曾经公开地讲，上帝把拯救欧洲的使命授予了德国人，我们不能容忍这种言论，因为它带有希特勒所臆造出来的“理论”的气味，这种“理论”说什么德国人是上帝的选民，其他各国人民都应当为他们效劳。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我希望各国的国家领导人在制定自己的政策时永远不要忘记历史的教训，不要让我们的子孙后代责备我们没有吸取教训，而又纵容了那些已经不止一次地侵犯过法国和我国的敌人进行武装，使他们有可能重新发动侵略进攻。你们知道，现在，在西德，复仇主义势力正在复活。这不能不使我们感到不安。西德国防军正在要求原子武装。现在，西德是你们的同盟者。而我们同你们在前两次世界大战中是反对德国的同盟者，而现在却互相对立。应该很好地思考这一切。
    西德政府正在竭尽全力阻挠缔结对德和约。我认为，任何一个思想健全的人都不会对我解释——至少我不能理解这一点，为了巩固和平，应当保留第二次世界大战的残迹。谁不想扑灭这些余烬，谁就是想燃起新战争的火焰。
    我们现在和将来都将尽一切努力，争取别人理解我们的政策，争取缔结对德和约。我再说一遍，我们都将努力朝这方面去做。如果我们的和平政策得不到西方国家的理解，那么，我们将不得不同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
    赫鲁晓夫说，法国朋友们！让我们友好吧，让我们共同努力为和平而斗争吧。如果，法国同苏联和其他爱好和平的各国人民的友谊将巩固的话，那么在欧洲就没有人会发出有利于战争的呼声了。
    午宴后，赫鲁晓夫一行参观了兰斯市诺特达姆大教堂，并乘汽车前往法国生产香槟酒的中心厄培内市访问。赫鲁晓夫到达厄培内市时受到数千市民的热烈欢迎。赫鲁晓夫参观了有二百一十七年历史的著名的莫艾山敦酿酒厂的酒窖。赫鲁晓夫在参观厄培内市后回到兰斯，出席了兰斯市政委员会为赫鲁晓夫举行的招待会。
    29日黄昏，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员乘专车离兰斯去法国北部最大工业中心里尔市访问。赫鲁晓夫到达里尔市时，受到聚集在车站广场和附近街道上的人群的热烈欢迎，他们向赫鲁晓夫发出了暴风雨般的欢呼声。在火车站上，赫鲁晓夫同志受到诺尔省长和市政当局代表的欢迎。
    车队在人群和法苏两国国旗的海洋中徐徐驶向里尔省政府。阴雨的天气并没有妨碍来自里尔工人区的许多代表团向苏联人民的使者表达他们的感情。
    在省府大门前，苏联政府首脑受到诺尔省长和他的夫人的欢迎。赫鲁晓夫在两列身穿白色制服、手持矿灯的矿工队伍中间走过。这是欢迎曾经做过矿工的一个伟大友好国家的政府的首脑的仪仗队。赫鲁晓夫热情地向他们问好，同他们握手和交谈。
    晚上，苏联政府首脑出席了在诺尔省政府为他举行的宴会。
    30日上午，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员离开了里尔。沿途经过鲁贝前往瓦特雷洛和马克安巴雷耳两个工业城市访问。他们到达瓦特雷洛市以后，参观了一家毛织厂。在这个工厂中，一批女工为苏联客人们表演了俄文歌曲“我的莫斯科”。
