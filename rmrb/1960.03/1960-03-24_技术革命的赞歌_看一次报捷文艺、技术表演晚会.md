Ode to the Technical Revolution
——Watching a Performance Evening of Triumphant Literary and Technical Skills
Zhang Qian

Harbin in late February is a city boiling with activity. Every day, every hour, new achievements in technical innovation emerge, and people are very excited. On just such an evening, workers from the industrial, transportation, financial, and trade fronts of Harbin used grand choruses, clapper talk, operas, and various technical demonstrations to report their outstanding achievements in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to the Party.

The triumphant literary evening began. The Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory's report was a song celebrating that everyone in their factory made suggestions, and everyone engaged in innovation, achieving chipless processing of electric vehicles in twenty days. On stage, a large red flag led the way, and behind the electric vehicle model, the worker singers sang their triumphal song:
	A clap of spring thunder, hundreds of birds sing,
	A gust of spring breeze paints the mountains red,
	From Lushan, a battle horn sounds,
	Oh, motherland! All the rivers respond.
	"Jiancheng" workers have high aspirations,
	In the hands of heroes, Kunlun seems small,
	Towards high, large, precision, and new,
	Leap forward, leap forward, leap forward again!
	The "Three Magic Weapons" are so good,
	Red light shines everywhere in the motherland,
	Shining on our bodies with full energy,
	Shining on our hearts and making our hands skillful.
	The Party's call is firmly remembered,
	The technical revolution is rising to a climax,
	Working hard and cleverly for twenty days,
	The chipless electric vehicle is made.

Then, using clapper talk, Xihe drum, and Ping opera, they narrated the benefits of processing chipless electric vehicles, the technical difficulties overcome by labor model Yu Xianghai in the casting of gear parts, and the twenty days and nights of hard work by the entire factory. Finally, the worker singers recited their own poem:
	Ten thousand red flags dance in the colorful clouds,
	Ten thousand news reports of triumph spread joy.
	Listen, what is flying?
	It is our motherland leaping forward on a steed.
	Quickly beat the war drums!
	Open your steel-like throats!
	Raise higher the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward,
	and the People's Communes,
	And climb the peaks of high, large, precision, and new!

The workers of the Jiancheng Machinery Factory expressed their boundless love for the motherland and the Party with fervent emotions and resounding songs, praised the power of the "Three Magic Weapons," and also expressed the working class's great ambition to make a great technical revolution. What heart-stirring songs, and what magnificent and profound emotions!

The program list was densely printed with nineteen singing items, including performance singing, group dance, Shandong fast stories, Henan ballads, comic dialogues.... These programs vividly and lively presented the magnificent scenes of the technical revolution movement in Harbin to the audience through recitation, speaking, singing, dancing, and other forms.

After the singing programs, the wonderful technical performances began. The skilled craftsmen were all so skilled, serious, accurate, and nimble in their operations and performances. They were competing for every second, even tenths of a second; victoriously racing against time.

The performances that won the most applause were those of some young female experts. Li Rong, a mail sorter from the Harbin Post Office, demonstrated high-speed mail sorting. She lowered her head slightly, picked up a large batch of letters with her left hand, fanned them out, and used her right hand to put each letter into a grid in front of a wooden frame according to the region. The letters seemed to be flying and floating. The audience's eyes couldn't keep up with the rise and fall of the letters, and thousands of letters were accurately placed in the wooden grids. Li Rong is only nineteen years old this year and joined the workforce three years ago. In the past two years, she has distributed more than four million pieces of ordinary mail to all parts of the country without a single mistake. She has increased her efficiency in sorting mail from 3,000 pieces per hour to more than 8,000 pieces, and has created a national record of 10,050 pieces, becoming a high-quality and fast flag for mail sorting in the country. Cao Guirong, a salesperson at the No. 1 Department Store, has only one year of work experience. She demonstrated bundling beer bottles, tying six beer bottles firmly and beautifully, making them easy to carry, in eleven seconds. Li Shuyun, the sales team leader of Renli Store, grabbed four taels of tea according to the audience's request, and wrapped it up in ten seconds. Her hands are small, and she had to grab the four taels in two handfuls. Wang Yuzhi, a cashier at Daoli Qiulin Store, demonstrated mixed counting of banknotes. One hundred banknotes with denominations of one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, and five yuan were mixed together, and the audience randomly drew out a few. Then she counted and mentally calculated at the same time, and finally reported that it was 263 yuan, not a penny off, and it only took twenty seconds.

Many of the experts were veterans, and they were not to be outdone. Zhang Guoshu, the old chef of Kuiyuan Pavilion, has thirty years of experience. During his performance, he stretched a dough into 1,024 noodles, as thin as a pin, very even, in one minute and thirty seconds. Liu Shengchang of Tonghe Mirror Shop carved words on a glass mirror in one minute, three seconds, and four tenths of a second, carving "The people of the city report triumph to the Party." Each stroke was neat, and several strokes carved out a very neat character.

It is true that every profession produces an expert. At the meeting, various operating techniques were also demonstrated: using a wooden board to lift a bolt of cloth took forty-seven seconds; measuring a bolt of cloth took thirty-seven seconds, both achieving the requirements of a beautiful posture, tight lifting, and neat cloth. In ten seconds, three pairs of leather shoes were visually inspected, and the shoe size was identified at a glance. Installing a bicycle, with more than twenty parts, took one minute, forty-three seconds, and two tenths of a second. A restaurant waiter calculated the bill on the table, calculating the bill for eleven dishes with various unit prices in ten seconds. Bank employees created their own banknote counting machine, which counted one thousand banknotes in only one minute and twenty-eight seconds.

The audience applauded these wonderful performances again and again with satisfaction, and congratulated the experts. Several times, the audience was invited to the stage to inspect the operating quality and performance effect of the experts, and each time they announced: "Completely accurate." At this time, satisfied laughter and deafening applause erupted in the venue.

Finally, a small group of viewers was invited to the kitchen of the venue to watch a small performance. A middle-aged chef picked up a live chicken, and from killing, scalding, plucking feathers, cutting it into pieces, to putting it in a pot and frying it, it took a total of two minutes and two seconds. It was almost impossible to see how he did each step, as if there were only a few movements, and the raw chicken had become a cooked dish. It can be seen that in these two minutes and two seconds, countless hard work was condensed.

The evening ended. But these triumphant literary programs and the performances of the technical experts left a deep memory in the hearts of the audience.

    技术革命的赞歌
    ——看一次报捷文艺、技术表演晚会
    张浅
    2月末的哈尔滨，生活在沸腾。每一天，每一小时，不断地有技术革新的新成绩出现，人们的心情很兴奋。就在这样一个夜晚，哈尔滨市工业、交通运输、财贸战线上的职工，把他们在技术革新和技术革命运动中的优异成就，用大联唱、快板、戏曲等形式，和通过各种技术表演，来向党报捷。
    报捷文艺晚会开始了。哈尔滨建成机械厂的报捷节目，是歌唱他们厂子人人提建议，个个闹革新，二十天实现了电瓶车无切屑加工。台上用一面大红旗作前导，在电瓶车模型的后面，工人歌手唱起自己的凯歌：
      一声春雷百鸟鸣，
      一阵春风漫山红，
      庐山发出战斗的号角，
      祖国呵！九江八河齐回应。
      “建成”工人志气高，
      英雄手下昆仑小，
      向着高大精尖新，
      飞跃，飞跃，再飞跃！
      “三大法宝”就是好，
      祖国处处红光照，
      照得全身干劲足，
      照得心灵手又巧。
      党的号召记得牢，
      技术革命起高潮，
      苦干巧干二十天，
      无屑电瓶车制成了。
    接着，用快板、西河大鼓和评戏的形式，叙述了加工无屑电瓶车的好处、劳动模范于相海攻破牙包铸件的技术难关，和全厂职工奋战二十昼夜的经过。最后，工人歌手们又朗诵起自己的诗篇：
    万杆红旗舞彩云，
    万张捷报传喜讯。
    听，是什么在飞腾？
    是我们祖国跨上骏马大跃进。
    快擂起战鼓！
    放开钢铁般的喉咙！
    更高地举起总路线、大跃进、
    人民公社的红旗，
    攀登高大精尖新的高峰！
    建成机械厂的工人，用火热的感情和高吭的歌声，表达了对祖国、对党的无限爱戴，赞扬了“三大法宝”的威力，也发抒了工人阶级大闹技术革命的雄心壮志。这是多么振人心弦的歌声，又是多么宏伟深厚的感情啊！
    节目单上，密密地排印着十九个演唱项目，有表演唱、集体舞蹈、山东快书、河南坠子、双簧……。这些节目，通过朗诵、说、唱、舞蹈等形式，把哈尔滨市技术革命运动中的壮丽场面，生动活泼地展现在观众面前。
    演唱节目一过，又开始了精彩的技术表演。能工巧匠，一个个那么熟练、认真，又那么准确、轻快地操作着，表演着。他们在争夺每一秒，甚至是十分之一秒；胜利地在同时间赛跑。
    赢得掌声最多的，是一些年青的女能手。哈尔滨市邮局分拣员李荣，表演了高速分拣信件。她微微低着头，左手拿起大批信件，掰成扇面形，右手按地区把一封封信投入面前木架的一些格子里。信件像是在飞，又像在飘。观众的眼睛来不及随着信件起落，成千封信，已经准确地放进木格子当中。李荣今年才十九岁，三年前参加工作。两年来，她向全国各地分发了四百多万件平信，无一差错。她分拣信件的效率，由每小时三千件，提高到八千多件，并且创造了一万零五百件的全国纪录，成了全国分拣信件的优质快速旗帜。市百货第一商店营业员曹桂荣，只有一年的工作经验。她表演捆扎啤酒瓶，六瓶啤酒扎得结实美观，便于携带，时间是十一秒。仁里商店的营业组长李淑云，当场按着观众的要求，抓出四两茶叶、包好，是十秒。她的手小，四两得两把抓成。道里秋林商店收款员王玉芝，表演了混合点钞。一百张一元、二元、三元、五元票面的钞票混在一起，由观众任意抽出几张。然后她边点数，边心算，最后报出是二百六十三元，一点也不差，仅仅用了二十秒。
    能手中有不少老将，他们更不示弱。魁元阁的老厨师张国书，有三十年的操作经验。他表演时用一分三十秒，把一块面团抻成一千零二十四根面条，像大头针一样细，十分匀称。同合镜庄刘盛昌在玻璃镜上刻字，一分三秒四，刻成了“全市人民向党报捷”，一刀一笔，几刀就刻出很齐整的一个字。
    真个是行行出状元。会上，还表演了各种各样的操作技术：用木板扳起一匹布，用了四十七秒；量一匹布三十七秒，都达到了姿式优美，扳的紧，布整齐的要求。十秒当中，目测三双皮鞋，一眼就道出鞋的号码。安装一部自行车，零件二十多样，用了一分四十三秒二。饭店服务员桌面算账，十秒算出十一盘各种单价的菜账。银行职工自己创造的点钞机，点一千张钞票只用了一分二十八秒。
    观众们怀着满意的心情，一遍又一遍地为这些精采的表演鼓掌，向能手们祝贺。有好几次，观众被邀请到台前去检验能手们的操作质量和表演效果，每次都宣布：“完全准确”。这时候，会场上又爆发出满意的笑声和震耳的掌声。
    最后，一小部分观众又被邀请到会场的厨房，去看一次小型表演会。一位中年厨师，拿起一只活鸡，从杀掉、烫洗、退毛、切成块，到放入锅中炸好，一共用了二分零二秒。几乎看不出，他是怎样一道道做下来的，好像只有几个动作，生鸡已经成了熟菜。看得出来，在这二分零二秒当中，凝结有数不清的辛勤的劳动。
    晚会结束了。但是这些报捷文艺节目和技术能手的表演，在观众的心里，却深深地留下了记忆。
