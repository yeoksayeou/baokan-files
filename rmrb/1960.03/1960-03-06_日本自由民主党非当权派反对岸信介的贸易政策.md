Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: According to today's "Tokyo Shimbun," non-mainstream factions within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party have expressed opposition to the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of trade and foreign exchange "liberalization."

The "Tokyo Shimbun" believes that the Kishi Nobusuke government, already in a difficult position regarding the new "Security Treaty" issue, will experience another difficult time on the "liberalization" issue.

The "Tokyo Shimbun" said that eleven members of the Ishibashi faction met on the 3rd to discuss the trade and foreign exchange "liberalization" policy, criticizing the Kishi Nobusuke government's views on this policy. The Ishibashi faction will try next week to get other non-mainstream factions to agree with their views.

The "Tokyo Shimbun" also said that the Matsumura-Miki faction will hold a similar meeting on March 11, at which they will launch criticisms of the Kishi Nobusuke government's "liberalization" policy.

Another influential non-mainstream leader, Ichiro Kono, has been attacking the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of trade "liberalization," which he says is bowing to pressure from the United States, in a series of speeches held in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and other places since mid-February. He pointed out that "liberalization" will hit Japanese agriculture, thereby causing serious chaos throughout Japanese economic activity.

Kono argued that Japan should not pursue the "liberalization" policy imposed on it by the United States and that Japan should have its own policies.

    日本自由民主党非当权派反对岸信介的贸易政策
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：据“东京新闻”今天报道，日本执政党自由民主党内的非当权派表示反对岸信介政府执行贸易和外汇“自由化”政策。
    “东京新闻”认为，目前在新“安全条约”问题上已经处境困难的岸信介政府，将在“自由化”问题上再经历一个艰难的时候。
    “东京新闻”说，石桥派的十一名成员在3日开会讨论了贸易和外汇“自由化”政策，批评了岸信介政府在这项政策上所持的意见。石桥派将在下星期设法使其他的非当权派同意他们的看法。
    “东京新闻”还说，松村—三木派将在3月11日举行类似的会议，他们将在会上就岸信介政府的“自由化”政策展开批评。
    另一位有影响的非当权派领袖河野一郎从2月中旬以来，在东京、大阪和名古屋等地举行的一系列演讲会上，抨击了岸信介政府屈从美国的压力，实行贸易“自由化”政策。他指出，“自由化”将打击日本的农业，从而在整个日本经济活动中引起严重混乱。
    河野主张，不应该奉行美国强加于日本的“自由化”政策，日本应该有自己的政策。
