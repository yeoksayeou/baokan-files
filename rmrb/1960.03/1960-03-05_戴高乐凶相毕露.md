De Gaulle is once again making colonialist clamors in Algeria.

This clamor was made on the 3rd when he went to Algeria to stabilize the military and spoke to the officers of the French invading army stationed there. This clamor is another naked self-exposure on his part. He openly said that the "military operations" to suppress Algeria "will continue for a long time," and that France must "restore peace by force." He also arrogantly clamored that France must strengthen its political, economic, and military control over Algeria for "several years" before "Algeria has the right to express their demands." Moreover, what is demanded can only be "choosing to be with France, to be connected with France." He was afraid that his subordinates would not understand the meaning of his words, so he simply added: "France must stay in Algeria."

This can be said to be another frank interpretation by De Gaulle of his deceptive statement of so-called recognition of Algeria's "right to self-determination."

In fact, De Gaulle's attempt to continue ruling Algeria has been obvious through his actions over the past month or so.

De Gaulle has used the riots that occurred not long ago to carry out a series of activities to strengthen dictatorial control over Algeria. In early February, he manipulated the National Assembly and the Senate to pass a bill giving his government "special powers" for one year. This bill allows the Debre cabinet, which is completely under his control, to "take relevant necessary measures" under the pretext of "maintaining order, defending the country, and carrying out pacification (i.e., military suppression) and administration in Algeria" by issuing orders, bypassing the parliament, according to Article 38 of the De Gaulle Constitution. On February 10, the French cabinet passed a decision to reorganize the French army and police in Algeria. This is De Gaulle's special use of the anger of people from all walks of life in France towards the recent Algerian riots to strengthen his direct control over the French colonial army and police in Algeria through this reorganization, in order to better serve the interests of the French local financial colonial monopoly groups. Immediately afterwards, on the 14th, the French "Government Gazette" published a decree deciding to establish an Algerian Affairs Committee led by the president. In addition to De Gaulle himself, the French Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Armed Forces, the Chief of the General Staff, the Delegate General stationed in Algeria, and the French Commander-in-Chief stationed in Algeria participated in this committee. This committee "has the right to make all decisions on Algerian issues before the French cabinet agrees." In addition, on the 17th, the French cabinet also appointed eight "governors" for Algeria and passed a decree: "The heads of the districts in Algiers city were originally elected, but will now be appointed." Through these steps, De Gaulle has actually completely grasped the full power to handle the Algerian issue.

What exactly De Gaulle plans to do on the Algerian issue is very clear. The communique issued by the De Gaulle government on January 22 regarding the situation in Algeria bluntly stated that France "will continue to vigorously promote" the "pacification" work in Algeria in 1960, which means that the French government wants to continue to use military means to suppress the Algerian people's national liberation movement. In his reassuring broadcast speech to the rioters on January 29, De Gaulle also repeatedly stated that in order not to "lose" Algeria, the dirty war of aggression must continue. After the riots subsided, the vast majority of rioters went scot-free, and some were even recruited by the authorities to fight against the Algerian National Liberation Army. The passage of this "special powers" bill is precisely to enable De Gaulle to act arbitrarily and realize his ambition to annex Algeria. As for the fact that Soustelle, who had followed him for twelve years, had actively organized fascist riots to support him and had helped him put together the "Union for the Defense of the New Republic," was dismissed during the reorganization of the De Gaulle government, this is the result of the surfacing of differences within the French ruling group on the Algerian issue. However, the one who filled Soustelle's position was the former Minister of the Armed Forces, Guillaumat, and the one who took over as Minister of the Armed Forces was none other than Messmer, who was commanding the colonial war in Algeria. No wonder De Gaulle couldn't help but say at the cabinet meeting when talking about the government reorganization: "The serious situation forces the French government to make decisions so that there can be a consensus on the Algerian issue at the core of the government." This "consensus" is, needless to say, to strengthen military suppression and political deception of the Algerian people, rather than truly recognizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination. This secret was further revealed in the process of the French cabinet's adoption of measures to reorganize the Algerian military and police on the 10th. Before announcing the reorganization, De Gaulle sent a delegation composed of the newly appointed Minister of the Interior, Minister of Justice, and Minister of the Armed Forces to Algeria to carry out activities. These three ministers held talks with the French police, judicial, and military personnel in Algeria, explaining to them the characteristics of the policy currently implemented by De Gaulle, which is a combination of military suppression and political deception, in order to maintain French colonial rule in Algeria. The task of the newly established Algerian Affairs Committee directly controlled by the President of the French government is, needless to say, also to realize De Gaulle's plan not to "lose" Algeria.

This latest clamor by De Gaulle is not accidental, although it is still the same old tune, it is of great benefit to the Algerian people, the French people, and the people of the world.

    戴高乐凶相毕露
    大鹏
    戴高乐又在阿尔及利亚发出了殖民主义的叫嚣。
    这次叫嚣是在3日他去阿尔及利亚安定军心、对驻在那里的法国侵略军军官们谈话时发出的。这次叫嚣是他再一次进行的赤裸裸的自我暴露。他公开说：镇压阿尔及利亚的“军事行动还要持续很久”，法国要“通过武力恢复和平”；并且狂妄地叫嚷要在法国对阿尔及利亚加强了政治、经济、军事等方面的控制“数年之后”，“阿尔及利亚才有权说出他们的要求”；而且所要求的也只能是“选择同法国在一起，同法国连系在一起”。他生怕他的下属听不懂他话中的意思，更干脆加了一句：“法国必须留在阿尔及利亚”。
    这可以说是戴高乐对于他的所谓承认阿尔及利亚的“自决权”的欺骗声明又一次坦率的诠解。
    实际上，戴高乐竭力准备继续统治阿尔及利亚的企图，通过他最近一个多月来的行径，早已昭然若揭了。
    戴高乐利用不久以前的暴乱事件，曾经对阿尔及利亚进行了一系列加强独裁控制的活动。2月初，他操纵国民议会和参议院通过给予他的政府以一年“特别权力”的法案。这个法案使完全受他控制的德勃雷内阁，能够在“维持秩序、保卫国家和在阿尔及利亚进行绥靖（即军事镇压）和施政”的借口下，有权根据戴高乐宪法第三十八条，用颁布命令的方式越过议会，采取有关的必要措施”。2月10日，法国内阁通过改组阿尔及利亚的法国军队和警察的决定。这是戴高乐为了更好地效忠于法国本土金融殖民垄断集团的利益，特别利用法国各阶层人士对最近的阿尔及利亚暴乱的愤怒情绪，通过这次改组来加强他对在阿尔及利亚法国殖民军队和警察的直接控制。紧接着在14日，法国“政府公报”发布了一道法令，决定建立一个由总统领导的阿尔及利亚事务委员会，参加这一委员会的除戴高乐本人外，还有法国总理、内政部长、武装部队部部长、总参谋长、驻阿尔及利亚总代表和驻阿尔及利亚法国总司令等人。这个委员会“有权在法国内阁同意以前，就阿尔及利亚问题作出一切决定”。另外，17日法国内阁还任命了八个阿尔及利亚的“省长”，并且通过法令：“阿尔及尔城各区区长原来是选举，现在将是任命的”。通过这些步骤，戴高乐就实际上完全掌握了处理阿尔及利亚问题的全权。
    戴高乐究竟准备在阿尔及利亚问题上作何打算，这是很清楚的。戴高乐政府1月22日发表的关于阿尔及利亚局势的公报中就曾露骨地讲到：法国“在1960年将继续大力推行”在阿尔及利亚的“绥靖”工作，这就是说法国政府想继续用武力手段来镇压阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动。戴高乐在1月29日向暴乱分子作安抚广播演说时，也一再表示为了不“丢掉”和“丧失”阿尔及利亚，要继续进行肮脏的侵略战争。暴乱平息之后，暴乱分子绝大多数逍遥法外，有的甚至被当局录用去对阿尔及利亚民族解放军作战。这次“特别权力”法案的通过，正是为了使戴高乐能够孤断独行，实现他并吞阿尔及利亚的野心。至于在戴高乐政府改组时，追随他十二年、曾积极组织法西斯暴乱拥他上台并帮他拼凑“保卫新共和联盟”的苏斯戴尔被免职了，这是法国统治集团内部在阿尔及利亚问题上的分歧表面化的结果。但添补苏斯戴尔的却是前任武装部队部部长居约马，而接任武装部队部部长的又正是在阿尔及利亚指挥殖民战争的梅斯梅尔。难怪戴高乐在内阁会议上谈到政府改组时情不自禁地说：“严重的局势迫使法国政府作出决定，使得在政府核心中对阿尔及利亚问题能有一致看法。”这种“一致看法”，不用说是加强对阿尔及利亚人民的军事镇压和政治欺骗，而不是真正承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权。这一秘密在10日法国内阁采取改组阿尔及利亚军警措施的过程中，进一步透露了出来。在宣布改组之前，戴高乐曾派了一个由新任的内政部长、司法部长和武装部队部部长组成的代表团到阿尔及利亚去活动，这三个部长分别同在阿尔及利亚的法国警察、司法和军队人员会谈，向他们解释了戴高乐目前所执行的政策的特点，那就是军事镇压和政治欺骗相结合，以求保持法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。关于法国政府新建的由总统直接控制的阿尔及利亚事务委员会的任务，不用说也是为了实现戴高乐的不“丧失”阿尔及利亚的计划。
    戴高乐最近这一次叫嚣不是偶然的、尽管仍旧是老调调，这对于阿尔及利亚人民、法国人民和全世界人民都有很大好处。
