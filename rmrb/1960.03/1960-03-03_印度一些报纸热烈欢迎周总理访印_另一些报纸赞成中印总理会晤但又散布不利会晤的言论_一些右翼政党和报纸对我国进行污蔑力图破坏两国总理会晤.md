Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 1st: Some Indian newspapers warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India to meet with Prime Minister Nehru on the Sino-Indian border issue.

    The "People's Power" weekly published an editorial on March 1st stating that the upcoming talks between the leaders of two great Asian nations have aroused worldwide interest. Premier Zhou Enlai took the initiative to propose the talks, and Prime Minister Nehru responded. People sincerely hope that the talks between the Indian and Chinese Prime Ministers will help resolve the Sino-Indian border issue peacefully and amicably.

    The editorial said, "It is particularly noteworthy that the Chinese leaders have expressed good feelings. The friendship between the Chinese and Indian people is eternal. We know that reactionary elements who want to drag India into the Cold War tensions will be uneasy about the Chinese leaders' repeated reaffirmations that the border dispute between the two countries can and should be resolved in a friendly atmosphere."

    The editorial said, "Premier Zhou's visit to India will not only be welcomed as a distinguished guest" but also as "one of our closest relatives."

    "The Great Andhra" published an editorial stating that Premier Zhou Enlai's acceptance of New Delhi as the venue for the talks clearly shows that the Chinese government and people are convinced that the friendship between our two peoples is eternal. When he comes here, he comes to negotiate a friendly resolution to the border dispute, and also as a peacemaker, a messenger of goodwill and friendship. The people of India welcome him to the capital of India and look forward to a fruitful meeting between the two prime ministers.

    "Freedom" published an editorial on February 29th entitled "Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship," welcoming Premier Zhou's visit to Delhi. The editorial said: "We are convinced that when both sides are completely sincere in their desire to resolve the dispute, the meeting will be successful. Zhou Enlai will come to our country as a very respected guest who has been invited. We must prepare to give him a proper welcome and hospitality, and we must maintain a friendly atmosphere. There is no doubt that the clouds of ill feeling will disappear these days, and the eternal sun of Sino-Indian friendship will shine again on the Himalayas."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 2nd: After Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru on February 26th was published, it aroused widespread reactions in Indian public opinion. Many reports welcomed Premier Zhou's visit to India from different perspectives, and supported the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India. However, some of them also spread some remarks that were not conducive to a friendly meeting.

    "The Epoch Times" published an editorial on March 1st saying that Premier Zhou's letter "is extremely friendly in its wording, full of goodwill towards India, and full of hope for the outcome of the talks between the two Prime Ministers." The editorial said: "We thank the Premier of New China, Zhou Enlai, for readily agreeing to come to New Delhi."

    It said that those in India who are trying to prevent the meeting of the two Prime Ministers will be disappointed when they read this letter, because Zhou Enlai has agreed to come to New Delhi in person, and they have lost an "opportunity to make a resounding outcry."

    "Hindustan Daily" editorial said that the possibility of joint negotiations between China and India should be welcomed. The editorial said: "No matter how great the distance between the positions of the two sides, the door to joint negotiations cannot be closed. There are only two possible ways to resolve international disputes: one is the method of war, and the other is the method of joint negotiation and resolution." The relationship between the two countries should not deteriorate when two neighboring countries must devote their main energy to their own development. However, this newspaper went so far as to demand that China withdraw from its own territory as a prerequisite for reaching an agreement.

    "The Tribune" published an editorial on March 1st entitled "Welcome Development," calling Zhou Enlai's reply letter "a hopeful development in the tense Sino-Indian relations." It said, "The wording of Zhou Enlai's letter to Nehru is friendly and appropriate," and the letter expressed the hope that India and China will maintain eternal friendship and resolve disputes peacefully. It said, "These are all good feelings, and everyone in this country will sincerely reciprocate with the same attitude." However, this newspaper insisted on the fallacy of so-called "Chinese aggression against Indian territory" and stated that India could not agree with the argument that the entire Sino-Indian border had never been delineated.

    The Indian "Statesman" believed in its editorial that the meeting was "appropriate," but at the same time, it spread pessimistic emotions about the prospects for the meeting.

Some right-wing political parties and newspapers in India stubbornly opposed the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India. When this conspiracy to obstruct the meeting failed, they tried every means to undermine the talks. On February 28th, a spokesperson for the Praja Socialist Party insisted that China withdraw from its own territory as a prerequisite for the talks.

    "The Times of India" reported on March 2nd that the President of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, Singh, issued a statement on March 1st attacking Nehru's invitation to Zhou Enlai. This sect will convene a meeting in Delhi in late March to plan "protests" during Premier Zhou's visit to India in April. "Hindustan Standard" editorialized on March 1st, denouncing China for "committing the crime of untrustworthiness and aggression" and clamoring for China to "withdraw from aggression" before Premier Zhou Enlai goes to India for talks. "The Indian Express" also unreasonably put forward conditions for negotiations.

    However, the right-wing's attempt to undermine the talks was countered by many people. "Free Press Journal" published an editorial on February 29th strongly criticizing the Praja Socialist Party's opposition to Nehru's invitation to Zhou Enlai. Referring to the so-called "Asian-African Tibet Conference" planned by this party to interfere in China's internal affairs, the editorial said that opposing the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India was a more dangerous move than holding this conference. It accused the Praja Socialist Party of adopting methods of boycott and demonstration, saying that this could only hinder and undermine the meeting.

    一些右翼政党和报纸对我国进行污蔑力图破坏两国总理会晤
    新华社新德里1日电　印度一些报纸热烈欢迎周恩来总理即将访问印度，同尼赫鲁总理就中印边界问题举行会晤。
      “人民力量”周报3月1日发表社论说，两个伟大的亚洲国家的领袖即将举行的会谈已经引起了全世界的兴趣。周恩来总理主动提议举行会谈，尼赫鲁总理已经响应。人们热诚地希望印中两国总理的会谈会有助于友好和平地解决印中两国边界问题。
    社论说，“特别值得注意的是中国领导人所表示的良好感情。中印两国人民的友谊是永恒的。我们知道，想把印度拖入冷战紧张局势的反动分子，对于中国领导人一再重申两国之间的边界争端能够而且应当在友好气氛中解决这点将感到不安。”
    社论说，“周总理来印度不仅将作为贵宾受到欢迎”，而且也将作为“我们的一个最密切的亲戚受到欢迎。”
      “大安得拉报”发表社论说，周恩来总理接受把新德里作为会谈地点这一点清楚地表明，中国政府和人民是确信我们两国人民之间的友谊是永恒的。当他来这里的时候，他是来就友好解决边界争执举行谈判的。也是作为一个和平的缔造者、亲善和友好的使者前来的。印度人民欢迎他来印度的首都，并且期待两国总理的有成果的会晤。
    “自由报”2月29日发表题为“印中友谊万岁”的社论，欢迎周总理访问德里。社论说：“我们确信：当双方对于解决纠纷的愿望都完全是真诚的时候，会晤就会是成功的。周恩来将作为被邀请的非常受尊敬的客人到我国来。我们必须准备给他合适的欢迎和款待，我们必须保持友好的气氛。毫无疑问，这些天的恶感的乌云将会消失，中印友谊的永恒的太阳将再次照耀着喜马拉雅山。”
    新华社新德里2日电　周恩来总理2月26日给尼赫鲁总理的复信公布以后，在印度舆论中引起了普遍的反应。许多报道从不同的观点欢迎周总理访问印度，赞成中印两国总理会晤。但是，它们有的同时又散布了一些不利于友好会晤的言论。
    “划时代报”3月1日发表社论说：周总理的信件“措词是极端友好的，充满了对印度的亲善，并且对两国总理会谈的结果满怀希望。”社论说：“我们感谢新中国的总理周恩来欣然同意来新德里。”
    它说，印度的那些尽力想阻止两国总理会面的人，在读这封信的时候将感到失望，因为周恩来已经同意亲自来新德里，他们就失去了一个“发出响彻云霄的叫嚣的机会。”
      “印度斯坦日报”的社论说：中印两国共同谈判的可能性应该受到欢迎。社论说：“不管两方的立场之间有多大的距离，共同谈判的大门是不能够关闭的。解决国际纠纷只可能有两种方法：一种是战争的方法，另一种是共同谈判和解决的方法。”当两个接邻的国家必须把它们的主要精力用于它们自己的发展的时候，两国之间的关系不应当恶化。但是，这家报纸竟然提出要中国撤出自己的领土，作为取得协议的先决条件。
    “论坛报”1日发表题为“可喜的发展”的社论，称周恩来的复信是“紧张的中印关系中有希望的发展。”它说，“周恩来给尼赫鲁的这封信的措词是友好的和适当的”，复信中表示了希望印度和中国保持永恒的友谊并和平地解决争端的情感。它说，“这些都是很好的情感，这个国家的每一个人将诚挚地报以同样的态度。”但是，这家报纸又坚持所谓“中国对印度领土进行了侵略”的谬论，并且表示印度不能同意整个中印边界从未划定的论点。
    印度“政治家报”在社论中一方面认为会晤是“适宜的”，但是它同时对会晤的前景又散布悲观情绪。
    印度一些右翼政党、报纸顽固地反对中印总理会晤，当这种阻挠会晤的阴谋破产后，又千方百计地破坏会谈。2月28日人民社会党的一个发言人硬要中国撤出它自己的领土作为会谈的先决条件。
    “印度时报”2日报道，全印印度教大会主席辛格3月1日发表声明，攻击尼赫鲁邀请周恩来。这个教派将在3月下旬在德里召开会议，策划在4月份周总理访问印度的时候组织“抗议”。“印度斯坦旗报”3月1日在社论中诬蔑中国，“犯了不守信义和侵略的罪行”，并且叫嚷要中国在周恩来总理到印度会谈以前“撤退侵略”。“印度快报”也无理地提出谈判的条件。
    但是，右派破坏会谈的作法遭到许多人的反击。“自由新闻”2月29日发表社论，强烈批评人民社会党反对尼赫鲁邀请周恩来的做法。社论谈到这个党筹划的干涉中国内政的所谓“亚非西藏会议”时说，反对中印两国总理会晤是比召开这个会议更危险的举动。它指责人民社会党采取抵制和示威的办法，说这样只能对会晤起阻碍和破坏作用。
