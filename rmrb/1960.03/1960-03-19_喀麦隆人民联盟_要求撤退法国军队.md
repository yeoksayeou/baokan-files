Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 17th. The Steering Committee of the Cameroon People's Union issued a statement here today, calling on the Cameroonian people to unite and continue to fight for the withdrawal of French troops from Cameroon and the realization of democracy at home.

Referring to the recent announcement by the Cameroonian authorities to abolish the ban imposed by the French colonialists on Cameroonian democratic groups in 1955, the statement said that while Cameroonian public opinion welcomes this measure, it believes that "the demands repeatedly put forward by the Cameroon People's Union must be realized, namely: the withdrawal of French troops; a complete and unconditional amnesty for political prisoners since 1954, and the release of imprisoned political prisoners; the abolition of all concentration camps, and the return of those exiled and forced into exile."

The statement, issued by the Steering Committee of the Cameroon People's Union after a two-day meeting in Accra, also expressed opposition to Cameroon's current constitution. It said, "Our opposition to the current constitution is based on the fact that this constitution not only does not protect the supreme interests of the Cameroonian people, but on the contrary, it legitimizes new colonial means - namely, what we consider to be neo-colonialism."

The statement also stated that members of the Cameroon People's Union will not be candidates for the elections scheduled to be held in Cameroon on April 10.

The statement called on all progressive forces in Cameroon to sincerely unite in battle and strive to achieve the above demands.

    喀麦隆人民联盟
    要求撤退法国军队
    新华社阿克拉17日电　喀麦隆人民联盟指导委员会今天在这里发表一项声明，号召喀麦隆人民团结起来，继续为使法国军队撤出喀麦隆和实现国内民主而斗争。
    声明在谈到喀麦隆当局不久前宣布废除法国殖民者在1955年对喀麦隆民主团体颁布的禁令时说，喀麦隆舆论界在对这项措施表示欢迎的同时，都认为“必须使喀麦隆人民联盟一再提出的那些主张得到实现，即：撤退法国军队；全部、无条件地大赦1954年以来的政治犯，释放被囚禁的政治犯；取消一切集中营，使被流放和被迫流亡的人们回来”。
    喀麦隆人民联盟指导委员会在阿克拉举行了两天会议以后发表的这项声明还表示反对喀麦隆目前的宪法。它说，“我们反对现行的宪法是基于这样的事实：这部宪法不但不保护喀麦隆人民的最高利益，而且恰恰相反，它把新的殖民手段——即我们认为的新殖民主义认定为合法”。
    声明还表示，喀麦隆人民联盟的成员将不作为预定在4月10日在喀麦隆举行的选举的候选人。
    声明号召喀麦隆国内一切进步力量在战斗中真诚团结起来，为实现上述要求而奋斗。
