The South African Authorities' Brutal Atrocities
By People's Daily Commentator

On March 21st, in the Transvaal Province of the Union of South Africa, Africans, unwilling to endure racial discrimination and persecution, launched a massive mass struggle against the "Pass Laws." The South African white authorities inhumanely used jet aircraft, armored vehicles, and machine guns to massacre unarmed African people. According to preliminary statistics, 56 Africans have been killed and 245 wounded. The shocking and bloody crimes committed by the South African white authorities cannot but arouse great indignation among peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world.

The South African white government has formulated no fewer than 70 types of racial discrimination laws persecuting Africans, with the "Pass Laws" being the most harmful to Africans. According to the provisions of the "Pass Laws," all Africans over the age of sixteen must carry 27 types of documents such as "identity cards" and "migration certificates," otherwise they will be arrested by the police and sent to farms or mines for forced labor. For a long time, the South African authorities have used this law to seize a large number of black laborers and deprive Africans of the most basic personal freedom. This extremely barbaric and shameless persecution has plunged South African Africans into an abyss of misery. In order to win basic human rights and freedom, South African Africans have been waging unyielding struggles for a long time. Especially since the large-scale anti-racial discrimination struggle broke out in Durban last year, the call for an end to racial oppression has become increasingly loud, and people from all walks of life in Africa have actively participated in the ranks of the struggle. Mass movements of protest and demonstration have sprung up one after another and continuously. It is very clear that the days when Africans, who account for three-quarters of the South African population, are subjected to slavery and persecution can no longer continue. Their demands are completely reasonable, and their struggles are completely just. Instead of immediately meeting these reasonable demands, the South African authorities used barbaric massacres to suppress the South African people, which further exposed the ferocity of the colonialists.

The massacre committed by the South African authorities once again proves that the colonialists are never willing to give up colonial rule. When the people rise up against slavery and oppression, the colonialists never skimp on their guns and bullets! If African people want to win independence, freedom, and democratic rights, they must go through serious and fierce struggles.

The day after the South African incident, the U.S. State Department even came out with a statement "expressing regret" over the South African authorities' actions to "suppress blacks." However, in this statement, the United States not only did not demand that the South African authorities immediately stop the persecution and discrimination against South African blacks and stop creating such atrocities, but instead demanded that "the people of South Africa will be able to use peaceful means to obtain compensation for legitimate grievances"! In the eyes of the U.S. State Department, the South African authorities, who used tanks and airplanes to carry out bloody massacres of African blacks, seemed to be "peaceful" enough, while those innocent demonstrators who died by bullets were still not "peaceful" enough! The U.S. State Department told them: It is okay for you to have "grievances"; but first, they must be "legitimate grievances," and those that do not comply with the laws of the South African reactionary authorities are not included in this category; second, when the South African authorities massacre you, you must also use "peaceful means" and stretch your necks to be slaughtered; third, even if you do all this, your "grievances" should not be satisfied, but only get a little "compensation"! This is the "sympathy" that U.S. imperialism expresses to the African people! The real purpose of the U.S. State Department's statement is to try to use this "sympathy" to win the favor of the African people, so that the U.S. colonial forces can increasingly intensify their invasion of Africa.

The South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and persecution has won the sympathy and support of all African people and all peace-loving people in the world. Although the South African government will continue its suppression in a desperate attempt, what is truly powerful is not the South African authorities' airplanes and tanks, but the South African people who are fighting tirelessly for basic human rights and freedom. The heroic South African people can never be subdued. Now, the fire of anti-colonialism and racism has spread throughout the African continent. Driven by the great struggle of all African people, one day, the South African people will completely bury the barbaric system of racial discrimination.

    南非当局的野蛮暴行
    本报评论员
    3月21日，在南非联邦的德兰斯瓦尔州，不甘于忍受种族歧视和迫害的非洲人掀起了规模巨大的反抗“通行证法”的群众性斗争。南非白人当局竟灭绝人性地使用喷气式飞机、装甲车、机关枪，对手无寸铁的非洲人民大肆屠杀。据初步统计，已有五十六名非洲人被打死，二百四十五人被打伤。南非白人当局犯下的骇人听闻的血腥罪行，不能不激起全世界爱好和平与维护正义人民的极大愤慨。
    南非白人政府制订的迫害非洲人的种族歧视法令不下七十余种，而以“通行证法”对非洲人的为害最甚。按照“通行证法”的规定，凡年满十六岁的非洲人必须随身携带“身份证”、“迁移证”等二十七种证件，否则即遭警察逮捕，并被送到农场或矿山进行强迫劳动。长期以来，南非当局根据这项法令，攫取了大批黑人劳动力，剥夺了非洲人的最起码的人身自由。这种极其野蛮和无耻的迫害，使南非非洲人陷入水深火热的深渊。为了争取基本的人权和自由，南非非洲人长期来一直在进行着不屈不挠的斗争。特别是去年德班港爆发了声势浩大的反对种族歧视的斗争以来，要求摆脱种族压迫的呼声日益响亮，各个阶层的非洲人民踊跃地参加到斗争的行列里，抗议示威的群众性运动此伏彼起，连续不断。事情很清楚，占南非人口四分之三的非洲人长期遭受奴役和迫害的日子，是不能继续下去了。他们的要求完全是合理的，他们的斗争完全是正义的。南非当局不但不立即满足这些合理要求，反而用野蛮的大屠杀来镇压南非人民，这进一步暴露了殖民主义者的穷凶极恶。
    南非当局制造的大屠杀事件，又一次证明了，殖民主义者是决不甘心放弃殖民统治的。当人民起来反对奴役、反对压迫的时候，殖民主义者从来不会吝惜他们的枪弹的！非洲人民要争取独立自由和民主权利，必须经过严重的激烈的斗争。
    在南非事件发生的第二天，美国国务院居然也出来发表声明，对南非当局“压制黑人”的行动“表示遗憾”。但是，在这个声明里，美国非但没有要求南非当局立即停止对南非黑人的迫害和歧视，不再制造这种暴行，却反而要求“南非人民将能够用和平手段使合法的不满得到补偿”！在美国国务院看来，使用坦克和飞机对非洲黑人进行血腥大屠杀的南非当局似乎是已经够“和平”的了，而那些无辜的饮弹而死的示威者却仍然是不够“和平”的！美国国务院向他们说：你们有“不满”是可以的；但第一，必须是“合法的不满”，不合南非反动当局法律的不在此例；第二，当南非当局屠杀你们的时候，你们也要使用“和平手段”，引颈受戮；第三，即使做到这一切，你们的“不满”也不应该得到满足，而只能得到一点点“补偿”！这就是美帝国主义对非洲人民所表示的“同情”！美国国务院发表声明的真正目的，就是企图用这种“同情”来骗取非洲人民对它的好感，以便于美国殖民势力日益加紧侵入非洲。
    南非人民对种族歧视和迫害的斗争，得到全非洲人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的同情和支持。尽管南非政府还会孤注一掷地继续进行镇压，但是，真正强大的不是南非当局的飞机和坦克，而是为争取基本人权和自由而斗争不息的南非人民。英勇的南非人民是绝对压服不了的。现在，反对殖民主义和种族主义之火已经燃遍非洲大陆，在全非洲人民的伟大斗争的推动下，总有一天，南非人民将彻底埋葬掉野蛮的种族歧视制度。
