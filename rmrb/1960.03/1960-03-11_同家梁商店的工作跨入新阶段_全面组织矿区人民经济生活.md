Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th – The national red banner of mining area stores, the Tongjialiang Mining Area Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province, has adopted methods of external learning and internal practice, combining learning and application, over the past three months. They have humbly learned from the advanced experiences of fraternal stores, developed non-staple food production, and begun to comprehensively organize the people's economic life, pushing their work to a new stage.

After the Ministry of Commerce held a national on-site meeting for stores here in October of last year, the store sent the deputy manager and others to the Shijingpo Trade Store in Chongqing to learn the experience of developing non-staple food production; the party branch secretary and others were sent to the Northeast to learn about the large-scale technical innovation in the catering industry in Jilin Province, as well as the meticulous service provided by Gu Renlian, a saleswoman at the Harbin Women and Children's Products Company, and other advanced experiences. Subsequently, two small-scale competitions and one large-scale competition, focusing on learning the advanced experiences of fraternal stores, were carried out among all store employees, further improving the level of service. In collaboration with the coal mine and the commune, a large-scale breeding farm was quickly established. Over the past three months, large numbers of chickens, ducks, rabbits, pigs, cattle, and sheep have been raised. After learning from the experience of fraternal stores, the Tongjialiang Restaurant also built a "universal stove," adding more than one hundred new dishes and varieties.

Under the unified leadership of the Party, the store, the coal mine, the trade union, and representatives of street residents jointly formed the "Tongjialiang District People's Economic Life Committee" to comprehensively carry out the work of organizing the people's economic life. Currently, the "People's Livelihood Service Agency" under the leadership of this committee has established sixteen consignment shops, organized residents to run thirty-nine service teams for washing, mending, knitting sweaters, whitewashing, papering, soldering, and repairing woodenware. Three service teams have also been specially organized for postpartum women, patients, and single workers to take care of children, cook, and buy things for postpartum women and patients, and sew and wash clothes and clean dormitories for single workers. They strive to provide whatever services are needed for production and help wherever there are difficulties. Due to the organization of the people's economic life and the mobilization of residents to participate in service teams, the daily life of the masses has become more convenient. The store employees continue to carry forward their original business advantages. When the coal mine was carrying out high production, the store's party branch put forward the slogan "Everyone should act, exert effort everywhere, and supply wherever there is a need." Sales staff delivered goods to the well three to five times a day, which greatly encouraged the miners. This year, in supporting the production's flying start, the number of commodities sold in the underground store has increased from forty to more than sixty, and underground boiling water stations and restaurants have been established. The workers happily said: "The store serves so wholeheartedly, we will definitely fire more shots and produce more coal."

    同家梁商店的工作跨入新阶段
    全面组织矿区人民经济生活
    新华社太原10日电　全国矿区商店的红旗——山西大同市同家梁矿区商店，在最近三个多月中，采用外学内练、学用并举的办法，虚心学习兄弟商店的先进经验，发展副食品生产，开始全面组织人民经济生活，把工作推向一个新的阶段。
    去年10月，商业部在这里召开全国商店现场会议以后，这个商店派副经理等人到重庆市石井坡贸易商店学到了发展副食品生产的经验；派党支部书记等人到东北学到了吉林省饮食业大搞技术革新，以及哈尔滨市妇女儿童用品公司营业员顾仁莲细心为顾客服务等等多种先进经验。接着，在全店职工中开展了以学习兄弟商店先进经验为主的两次小比武和一次大比武，进一步提高了服务水平，并与煤矿、公社协作，很快地建立起大型饲养场。三个月来，饲养了大群鸡、鸭、兔和猪、牛、羊。同家梁饭店在学习兄弟商店的经验以后，还建起一个“万能灶”，新增加饭菜花样一百多种。
    这个商店和煤矿、工会、街道居民代表等，在党的统一领导下，共同组成了“同家梁区人民经济生活委员会”，全面展开组织人民经济生活的工作。现在，这个委员会领导下的“人民生活服务社”已经设立十六个代销店，组织居民办了三十九个拆洗、缝补、织补毛衣、粉刷、裱糊、锡焊、修理木器等服务小组，还为产妇、病人、单身职工专门组织了三个服务组，替产妇、病人照顾孩子、做饭、买东西，给单身职工缝洗衣服、打扫宿舍。做到生产有什么需要，他们就搞什么服务；哪里有困难，他们就到那里帮助。由于组织人民经济生活，发动居民参加服务小组，群众日常生活更加便利。商店职工继续发扬了原来的经营优点。在煤矿大搞高产时，商店党支部提出“人人动手，处处使劲，哪里需要，那里供应”的口号。营业员每天到井下送货三、五次，对矿工鼓舞很大。今年在支援生产开门红中，井下商店经营的商品由四十种增加到六十多种，并且建立了井下开水站和饭店。工人高兴地说：商店如此不遗余力地服务，我们一定多打炮，多出煤。
