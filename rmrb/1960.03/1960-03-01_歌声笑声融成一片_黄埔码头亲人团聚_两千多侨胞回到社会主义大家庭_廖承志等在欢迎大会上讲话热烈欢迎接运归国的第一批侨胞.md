Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th—Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: The first four ships dispatched by our country to overseas to pick up repatriated overseas Chinese in our history—"Meishangmei," "Dabaokang," "Fuan," and "Haihuang"—returned to the warm embrace of the motherland this morning, fully loaded with more than two thousand one hundred repatriated overseas Chinese who had suffered persecution in Indonesia. More than four thousand people from all walks of life in Guangzhou, in the sunny, festive Huangpu Pier, joyfully welcomed and comforted their relatives returning from overseas.

At 9:30 AM, when the first ship, "Meishangmei," slowly approached the shore of Huangpu Port, the pier and the ship instantly erupted. The welcoming crowd applauded warmly, set off firecrackers, and waved bouquets. Amidst the resounding singing of "Ode to the Motherland," female students, holding large bunches of colorful balloons, squeezed straight to the shore; they kept waving to the overseas Chinese on the ship. In the joyful crowd, a large group of lions danced vigorously to the sound of gongs and drums. The "Big Head Buddha" wearing a mask, holding a sunflower fan, jumped around in front of the lion group. At this time, the ship's rails and decks of the first ship "Meishangmei," which was slowly docking, were filled with dense crowds. In this happy moment of about to step on the land of the motherland, some overseas Chinese were laughing, and some were with tears in their eyes. They all kept waving to their relatives in the motherland.

The ship docked. The overseas Chinese who had experienced all kinds of hardships finally set foot on their homeland. The first to walk down the escalator was Wu Aqi, a 77-year-old repatriated woman. She returned with her grandson. The reception staff supported her. Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Director of the Reception and Settlement of Repatriated Overseas Chinese Committee, and Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Guangdong Province, stepped forward to warmly welcome her. Wu Aqi was moved and thanked the relatives for their warm welcome while walking and cupping her hands. Under the support of the reception staff, the elderly walked down the ship one after another, slowly passing through the welcoming crowd. They all nodded and smiled while cupping their hands to express their gratitude. The party and government leaders present at the welcome constantly shook hands and greeted them. Inspectors from the Huangpu Port Border Inspection Station helped the overseas Chinese carry their children off the ship. In this batch of returning ships, an overseas Chinese woman gave birth to a child on the ship. Doctors and nurses who knew the good news waited at the pier with stretchers to welcome the mother. The joyous crowds on the ship and on the shore warmly greeted each other, shook hands cordially, colorful flags, exciting whistles, warm applause, loud singing, unrestrained laughter, echoing slogans and deafening gongs and drums, all this made the Huangpu Pier present a moving scene of relatives reuniting.

Also present at the pier today to welcome the overseas Chinese were: Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhang Zhuguo, You Yangzu, Wang Yuanxing, Huang Jie, Wu Yixiu, Li Mei, and Hu Renkui, members of the Reception and Settlement of Repatriated Overseas Chinese Committee of the People's Republic of China; Zhong Qingfa, Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Wen Minsheng, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Reception and Settlement of Repatriated Overseas Chinese Committee; Wang De, Deputy Chairman of the Committee, First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee; Zhu Guang, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Guangzhou; Sun Leyi, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, and heads of overseas Chinese affairs departments of Guangdong Province, Fujian Province, Yunnan Province, Shanghai Municipality, and Guangzhou Municipality.

The repatriated overseas Chinese students who participated in the welcoming ranks today specially wore colorful costumes of various ethnic groups in the motherland. A dance team composed of sixty students continuously danced collective dances such as "Dance of Friendship" and "Socialism is Good" in the square. When the repatriated overseas Chinese passed through the welcoming ranks, the students happily smiled, danced, clapped rhythmically, and enthusiastically shouted: "Grandpas, welcome!" "Old ladies, hello!" "Young people, welcome!" The repatriated overseas Chinese nodded, waved, and laughed frequently, and some were moved to tears. Passing through the jubilant welcoming crowd, the overseas Chinese walked towards the venue of the welcome meeting.

At 10:30 AM, after all the overseas Chinese had disembarked, the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Municipality Welcome Repatriated Overseas Chinese from Indonesia Conference began. Wang De, First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He represented the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee, and the 2.3 million people of Guangzhou to warmly welcome the repatriated overseas Chinese. He said: "We welcome all overseas Chinese who have suffered persecution in Indonesia and who are unwilling to reside there to return. The motherland has sufficient strength and full conditions to properly arrange the lives, work, and study of the repatriated overseas Chinese."

Next, Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Reception and Settlement of Repatriated Overseas Chinese Committee of the People's Republic of China and Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, spoke at the meeting. He said: "You have gone through all kinds of hardships and returned to the land of the great motherland safely and smoothly. Here, on behalf of the Reception and Settlement of Repatriated Overseas Chinese Committee of the People's Republic of China and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, I extend to you a warm welcome and cordial greetings."

Liao Chengzhi said: "Overseas Chinese! You have worked hard in Indonesia! As you know, we and Indonesia have been friendly in recent years, and the overseas Chinese have also abided by Indonesian government laws and lived in harmony with the Indonesian people. But since May of last year, due to the anti-Chinese activities launched by powerful groups in Indonesia, you have suffered a lot of grievances there. Today, our country is a strong socialist motherland. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy. We never bully anyone, and at the same time, we do not allow anyone to bully our overseas Chinese. After powerful groups in Indonesia launched large-scale and comprehensive anti-Chinese activities, our Foreign Minister Chen Yi put forward three proposals for resolving the overseas Chinese issue through friendly consultation, that is: to immediately resolve the issue of dual nationality; to resolve the overseas Chinese issue comprehensively; and to assist overseas Chinese in Indonesia who lack a livelihood and are willing to return to their country. Ambassador Huang Zhen also put forward six requests on behalf of our government. If the Indonesian government is willing to maintain friendly relations with our country based on the Five Principles and following the Bandung spirit, and resolve the overseas Chinese issue between our country and Indonesia, it should cooperate with us. On the basis of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese issue should be resolved through consultation. And assist the overseas Chinese who are willing to return to their motherland to return smoothly."

Liao Chengzhi said: "Dear compatriots! Now you have returned on the first batch of ships sent by the motherland! There are still many overseas Chinese who are willing to return but have not returned. We will send the second, third, and fourth batches of ships, and if necessary, we will send more ships to pick up the overseas Chinese who are willing to return to their country. However, this does not in the slightest reduce the responsibility of the Indonesian government to repatriate the overseas Chinese."

At the meeting, Liu Changjiang, a repatriated overseas Chinese, expressed his deep gratitude to the motherland government on behalf of more than two thousand repatriated overseas Chinese. He said: "Now that we have returned to the embrace of the motherland, we are now free and happy people who have escaped from the sea of ​​suffering. The motherland government cares for us so meticulously and receives us properly. We will thank the Party and Chairman Mao for the rest of our lives, and thank all the people. We are determined to make contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland to repay the Party, repay Chairman Mao, and repay all our relatives."

After the welcome meeting, the overseas Chinese went to the rest room at the pier to happily eat tea and snacks. More than a dozen doctors and nurses took this opportunity to carefully treat the sick overseas Chinese. The repatriated overseas Chinese rested and chatted casually with their relatives in the motherland. Zhou Qingwen, an old overseas Chinese who had been wandering overseas since he was eighteen years old, had not returned to the motherland for more than fifty years. This time, he brought all twelve members of his children and grandchildren back. While resting, he excitedly talked about his feelings after setting foot on the land of the motherland: "The government is indeed a good government, and the people are good people! On the ship, tea and meals were brought to us by the reception staff." He raised his thumb and emphasized: "The motherland is just like this. I am so happy to come back this time!" Deputy Director Fang Fang and Mayor Zhu Guang inquired in detail about their living conditions during the journey when they talked with the overseas Chinese. Lin Mingshou, a 72-year-old repatriated overseas Chinese, was moved to tears when he talked about the scene of his family of ten returning safely with the help of the motherland.

After a short rest, the overseas Chinese boarded the train one after another. As the train slowly traveled on the beautiful fields of the motherland, some elderly repatriated overseas Chinese with silver beards and white hair, who had not returned to their country for many years, kept their heads close to the windows, looking at the scenery of the motherland outside the car; they were interested in every plant and tree in the motherland. Pan Yumei, Pan Yuanmei, and several other girls who grew up in Indonesia, waved and smiled at the pedestrians outside the car while singing songs such as "Ode to the Motherland" and "Unity is Strength" that they learned before returning to China. Their brother, Pan Jinhe, accompanied them on the harmonica, and the singing was full of the joy of returning to the embrace of the motherland.

When the train arrived at Sanyuanli in the suburbs of Guangzhou, the local people beat gongs and drums and danced lions to welcome them. Soon, the train stopped near the Sanyuanli Overseas Chinese Hostel. The welcoming crowd warmly applauded around the train, waved colorful flags, and sang "Socialism is Good." The repatriated overseas Chinese stretched out their hands from the train windows and waved frequently to their welcoming relatives.

The repatriated overseas Chinese got off the train and arrived at the Sanyuanli Overseas Chinese Hostel. The staff of the hostel and the Young Pioneers warmly welcomed them, vying to help them carry their luggage; they also brought out hot strong tea to entertain them. The overseas Chinese were about to spend their first night after returning to the motherland happily here.

    歌声笑声融成一片　黄埔码头亲人团聚
    两千多侨胞回到社会主义大家庭
    廖承志等在欢迎大会上讲话热烈欢迎接运归国的第一批侨胞
    新华社广州29日电　新华社记者报道：我国历史上首次派往海外接运归国华侨的第一批四艘轮船——“美上美”号、“大宝康”号、“福安”号、“海皇”号，今天上午满载着在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的两千一百多名归国侨胞，回到祖国温暖的怀抱。广州市各界人民四千多人，在阳光灿烂、鼓乐喧天的黄埔码头上，兴高彩烈地迎接和慰问从海外归来的亲人。
    九时三十分，当第一艘轮船“美上美”号徐徐向黄埔港岸靠拢的时候，码头上、轮船上顿时沸腾起来。欢迎的人群热烈地鼓掌，燃放起鞭炮，挥舞着花束。在“歌唱祖国”的嘹亮歌声中，女学生们，举着大束彩色汽球，直往岸边挤去；她们不停地向船上的侨胞们挥手致意。在欢乐的人潮里，一大群狮子在锣鼓声中起劲地跳着舞。戴着脸谱的“大头佛”，拿着葵扇，在狮子群面前，跳来跳去。这时候，徐徐靠岸的第一艘轮船“美上美”号的船舷、甲板上，站满了密密麻麻的人群。在这快要跨上祖国土地的幸福时刻里，有的侨胞在欢笑，有的侨胞噙着热泪。他们都向祖国的亲人们，不停地招手。
    船靠岸了。经历了千辛万苦的侨胞们，终于踏上了自己的国土。第一个走下扶梯的是七十七岁的归侨妇女吴阿七。她带着孙子回来了。接待人员搀扶着她。华侨事务委员会主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任廖承志和中共广东省委书记处书记、广东省省长陈郁等上前热情地迎接她。吴阿七感动地一边走一边拱手感谢亲人们的热情欢迎。在接待人员扶持下，老人们一个接着一个走下船来，缓步穿过欢迎的队伍。他们都一边点头微笑，一边拱手致谢。在场欢迎的党政负责人，不断地同他们握手问好。黄埔港边防检查站的检查员，帮助侨胞抱着小孩走下船来。在这批返国的轮船中，有一位华侨妇女在船上生下了孩子。知道这个喜讯的医生们、护士们，带着担架，在码头上迎接产妇。船上和岸上欢乐的人群，热情地问好，亲切地握手，五彩缤纷的旗帜，激动人心的汽笛声，热烈的掌声，嘹亮的歌声，纵情的欢笑声，此起彼伏的口号声和震耳欲聋的锣鼓声，这一切使黄埔码头呈现出亲人团聚的动人情景。
    今天到码头上欢迎侨胞们的还有：华侨事务委员会副主任方方、庄希泉、黄长水、庄明理，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长连贯，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员张柱国、尤扬祖、王源兴、黄洁、吴益修、李梅、胡仁奎，华侨事务委员会办公厅主任钟庆发，中共广东省委书记处书记、省接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员文敏生，副主任委员、中共广州市委第一书记王德，中共广州市委书记、广州市市长朱光，广州市副市长孙乐宜以及广东省、福建省、云南省、上海市、广州市的侨务部门负责人等。
    参加欢迎行列的归国华侨学生们，今天特地穿戴着祖国各个民族的彩色服装。由六十名学生组成的舞蹈队，在广场上不停地跳着“友谊之舞”和“社会主义好”等集体舞蹈。当归国侨胞穿过欢迎行列的时候，学生们便高兴地笑着、跳着，有节奏地鼓着掌，还热情地喊道：“爷爷们，欢迎您！”“老大娘，你们好！”“青年们，欢迎您！”归国侨胞们听了，频频点头、招手、欢笑，有些人激动得流下泪来。穿过兴高彩烈的欢迎人群，侨胞们向欢迎大会的会场走去。
    十时三十分，当侨胞们全部登岸后，广东省、广州市欢迎印度尼西亚的归侨大会开始了。中共广州市委第一书记王德在会上致欢迎词。他代表中国共产党广州市委员会、广州市人民委员会，和广州全市二百三十万人民，热烈地欢迎归国侨胞。他说：“我们欢迎在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的和不愿意在那里居留下去的华侨全部回来。祖国有足够的力量和充分的条件，来妥善地安排归侨们的生活、工作和学习。”
    接着，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任、中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会主任廖承志在会上讲话。他说：“你们历尽艰难困苦，平安地、顺利地回到了伟大祖国的土地上。在这里，让我代表中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会和中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会，向你们致以热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。”
    廖承志说：“侨胞们！你们在印度尼西亚辛苦了！正如你们所知道的一样，我们和印度尼西亚在这几年来一直是友好的，华侨也遵守印度尼西亚政府法令，和印度尼西亚人民友好相处。但自去年5月以来，由于印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起排华、反华活动，使你们在那里受了许多委曲。今天，我国是强大的社会主义祖国。在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导之下，我国一贯地奉行着和平外交政策，我们从来不去欺侮任何人，同时，也不容许任何人来欺侮我们的侨胞。在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起大规模的、全面的排华、反华活动以后，我国陈毅外长便提出了通过友好协商解决华侨问题的三项建议，这就是：立即解决双重国籍问题；全盘解决华侨问题；并协助在印度尼西亚缺乏生计而愿意归国的华侨回国。黄镇大使又代表我国政府提出了六项要求。如果印度尼西亚政府愿意根据五项原则，遵循万隆精神，真正和我国保持友好关系，解决存在于我国和印度尼西亚之间的华侨问题的话，就应当和我们合作。在保护华侨正当权利和利益的基础之上，通过协商解决华侨问题。并协助愿意返回祖国的华侨顺利回国。”
    廖承志说：“亲爱的同胞们！现在你们乘着祖国派去的第一批船只回来了！还有很多愿意回来的侨胞没有回来，我们还要派第二批、第三批、第四批船只，必要的话，还将派更多的船只去接运愿意回国的侨胞返回祖国。虽然如此，但这丝毫没有减少印度尼西亚政府所应承担的遣送华侨回国的责任。”
    会上，归侨刘长江代表两千多归国侨胞向祖国政府表示深切的感谢。他说：“现在我们已经回到祖国的怀抱了，我们已经是脱离苦海获得自由幸福的人了。祖国政府如此无微不至关怀我们，妥善地接待我们，我们终生感谢党和毛主席，感谢全体人民。我们决心在祖国的社会主义建设中作出贡献，来报答党，报答毛主席，报答各位亲人。”
    欢迎会结束后，侨胞们到码头的休息室里高高兴兴地吃茶点。十多个医生护士，趁这个时候，细心地为患病的侨胞们看病。归国侨胞们一面休息，一面和祖国的亲人们随意攀谈。十八岁便到海外飘泊的老华侨周清文，已经有五十多年没有回到祖国。这次他带了儿孙十二口人全部回来。在休息的时候，他激动地谈起踏上祖国土地后的心情：“政府确是好政府，人民是好人民啊！船上，喝茶、吃饭，接待人员都端到我们面前来。”他翘起大拇指着重地说：“祖国就是这个。我这次回来，太欢喜了！”方方副主任、朱光市长和侨胞们交谈时，详细地询问了他们旅途中的生活情况。七十二岁的老归侨林明寿，谈到他一家十口在祖国的帮助下安然回来的情景时，激动得流下泪来。
    稍事休息后，侨胞们陆续登上火车。当列车在祖国美丽的原野上缓缓地行驶时，一些银须白发、多年没有回国的年老归侨，不断地把头挨近窗口，眺望车外的祖国风光；他们对祖国的一草一木都感到兴趣。潘玉妹、潘园妹等几个在印度尼西亚生长的姑娘，一面向车外的行人招手微笑，一面唱着她们回国前学会的“歌唱祖国”、“团结就是力量”等歌曲。她们的弟弟潘金和在一旁吹口琴伴奏，歌声里充满了返回祖国怀抱的欢乐心情。
    当列车到达广州郊区三元里时，当地群众敲锣打鼓，舞着狮子，前来欢迎。不久，列车就停在三元里华侨招待所附近，欢迎的人群围着列车热烈鼓掌，挥舞着彩旗，高歌“社会主义好”。归侨们从车窗里伸出手来，向欢迎的亲人们频频挥手致意。
    归侨们下了火车，到达三元里归侨招待所。招待所工作人员和少先队员们，热情地欢迎他们，争着帮助他们搬行李；还端出热腾腾的浓茶来，招待他们。侨胞们就要在这里愉快地度过返回祖国后的第一个夜晚。
