A Good Experience in Industrial Support for Agriculture

    In the mass movement of industrial support for agriculture, many regions have seen a valuable new development. That is, leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers of agricultural machinery factories are adopting various methods to "cultivate experimental fields" in rural areas, and together with rural craftsmen, they are summarizing the experience of rural tool reform and manufacturing agricultural tools and machinery suitable for China's farming conditions. This is a good experience, and it has profound significance for accelerating agricultural technological transformation and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    China is a vast country with abundant resources. It has boundless plains and continuous mountains; it has paddy fields and dry land. The conditions of soil, climate, and water sources vary greatly. When the Northeast is still covered with snow, the South is already in the spring with peach blossoms and green willows. The farming conditions and technical levels in various regions are very different. This situation requires China's agricultural machinery manufacturing industry to have a strong regional adaptability, to produce a variety of agricultural machinery from specific conditions, and should not and cannot only produce a few unified types of products. In particular, due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 and 1959, and the thorough implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in various regions, after a revolution in the farming system, China's excellent tradition of intensive cultivation has been further developed, which has put forward a series of new issues for the agricultural machinery industry. For example, large-scale development of high-yield plots and the implementation of advanced gardening require many new tools for leveling land; deep plowing and close planting also require corresponding farming tools; large-scale water conservancy construction requires a large number of channel irrigation tools; and the great development of animal husbandry, with pig raising as the head, from feed processing, pig feeding, manure dumping to soil transportation and pen matting, requires various tools. And these tools must have different characteristics in mountainous areas, plains, paddy fields, and dry land. In the face of this new situation, agricultural machinery industrial departments are required to manufacture various agricultural machinery suitable for China's "soil and water."

    How to design and manufacture a variety of agricultural tools and machinery? The best way is to go to the countryside to earnestly study and summarize the experience of the rural tool reform movement. To absorb rich nutrition from the tool reform movement, the countless improved agricultural tools created by the skilled craftsmen among the broad masses of peasants in the tool reform movement are rich materials for China's agricultural machinery manufacturing. The agricultural machinery factory of Qizhou Commune in Anguo County, Hebei Province, adopted the method of cultivating experimental fields, combined with skilled craftsmen, and summarized the experience of decentralized and sporadic tool reforms in recent years. In response to the new situation after gardening, they successfully manufactured a combined machine for plowing, harrowing, sowing, and ridging suitable for the gardening farming system, completing the work of five processes in one operation. One day's work can save more than 700 laborers. This vivid fact shows that the Marxist-Leninist leadership method of cultivating experimental fields is also applicable to the design and manufacture of agricultural machinery.

    Some enterprise leaders have this view: "Producing agricultural tools and machinery, three screws, two plowshares, scattered, affect the improvement of industrial level." Whether this view is correct can be answered by cultivating an experimental field in the countryside. By cultivating experimental fields, understanding the needs of the countryside, and summarizing the experience of rural tool reform, it is possible to design products in light of local characteristics; after production, it is tested and then tested in actual operation, and constantly improve the shortcomings. In this way, the design and production level of the factory will not only not be hindered, but will continue to improve. Xingjiawan Agricultural Machinery Factory in Julu County originally only had 20 "old-fashioned" machine tools and more than 200 workers, and could only produce simple products such as iron shovels and hoe blades. The largest product was a five-wheel waterwheel. When it started producing agricultural machinery, the factory had no drawings and no samples. Therefore, the staff went deep into the countryside to summarize the experience of tool reform, and constantly armed themselves in supporting agriculture. Now it has developed into an agricultural machinery factory with 52 yuan vehicles, universal milling machines and other technical equipment and 470 workers. It can not only repair and assemble large-scale agricultural machinery, but also design and manufacture 35 kinds of agricultural machinery. Isn't this a good proof?

    Is the method of "cultivating experimental fields" in rural areas only applicable to county and commune industries, and some large enterprises do not have to do this? Large enterprises can not only do this, but should do this. Large enterprises produce relatively fixed products, and they are produced in large quantities, and the areas supplied are generally wider. These are all facts. However, it also needs to constantly improve its products and constantly strive for perfection according to the continuous development of agricultural production. These large enterprises should also pay attention to understanding the needs of the countryside and fully value the experience of tool reform in the design and manufacture of new products. During the production of tractors, Tianjin Tractor Factory established regular contact with rural people's communes, and improved the structure and casting methods of some main parts according to the opinions of the people's communes, so that the quality of the tractors was constantly improved, which is a good proof.

    The far-reaching significance of agricultural machinery factories "cultivating experimental fields" in rural areas lies in further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly told us that the problem of peasant allies is of extreme importance both in the revolutionary period and in the construction period. After the liberation of the whole country, China's worker-peasant alliance has gone through two stages. The first stage was to establish the worker-peasant alliance on the basis of thorough implementation of land reform; the second stage was to establish the worker-peasant alliance on the basis of socialist ownership through cooperativization. Now, China's worker-peasant alliance has entered a new stage with the beginning of the people's commune and the new stage of socialist construction. In this stage, one of the central contents is to gradually realize the technological transformation of agriculture on a large scale. In this new stage, it is even more important to further close the friendship between workers and peasants. Lenin said long ago: "It is our duty, one of the basic tasks of the ruling working class, to establish mutual relations between urban workers and rural laborers, and to determine a form of friendly mutual assistance that can be easily established." There are many ways to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis. The agricultural machinery factory's method of "cultivating experimental fields" enables workers and peasants to establish regular contact, which is a good form. As a result of adopting this method in various parts of Hebei, the relationship between workers and peasants has been further strengthened. When the commune has difficulties, the factory sends workers down to solve them. When the factory has some problems with insufficient raw materials and labor, the commune helps to solve them. The factory manufactured new products and reported the good news to the commune; the peasants created new achievements in production and also reported the good news to the factory. Workers and peasants have established a close friendship in jointly accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture, and the worker-peasant alliance is becoming increasingly consolidated on a new basis.

    Adopting the method of "cultivating experimental fields" is a good experience in strengthening the cooperation between industry and agriculture and the friendship between workers and peasants. Recently, the leading organs of Hebei Province have formed this method into a system, and each agricultural machinery factory has established regular contact with at least one commune or one production team. This is a very meaningful measure. If agricultural machinery factories and various factories related to agricultural machinery production all over the country do this, then it can be fully expected that the speed of China's agricultural technological transformation will be greatly accelerated, and the friendship and unity of workers and peasants will be further strengthened.

    工业支援农业的一个好经验
    在工业支援农业的群众运动中，许多地区出现了一个可贵的新事物。这就是农业机械工厂的领导干部、技术人员和工人，采取各种方式，在农村中“种试验田”，同农村的能工巧匠一起，总结农村工具改革的经验，制造适合我国耕作条件的农具、农械。这是一个好经验，对于加速农业技术改造、进一步巩固工农联盟有着十分深刻的意义。
    我国是一个地大物博、幅员辽阔的国家。有广阔无垠的平原，有延绵不断的高山；有水地，有旱田。土壤、气候、水源等条件差别很大，当东北还是白雪皑皑的时候，南方已是桃红柳绿的春天。各地的耕作条件、技术水平，都有很大不同。这种情况要求我国农业机械制造工业必须要有较强的地区适应性，必须从具体条件出发，生产多种多样的农业机械，不应该也不可能只生产少数统一类型的产品。特别是由于1958年和1959年农业生产连续大跃进，各地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，经过耕作制度上的大革命，我国精耕细作的优良传统得到进一步发扬，这更给农业机械工业提出一系列新的课题。例如大搞丰产方、实行高级园田化，就需要许多新式平整土地的工具；深耕密植，也要求有与之相适应的耕种工具；大兴水利，需要大批渠道灌溉工具；以养猪为首的畜牧业的大发展，从饲料加工、喂猪、倒粪到运土、垫圈，都需要各种各样的工具。而这些工具在山区、平原地区，在水地、旱地，又要有不同的特点。在这种新的形势面前，要求农业机械工业部门必须制造出适合我国“水土”的各种农业机械。
    怎样去设计、制造多种多样的农具农械呢？最好的办法是到农村去认真研究、总结农村工具改革运动的经验。从工具改革运动中吸取丰富的营养，在工具改革运动中，广大农民中的能工巧匠创制的无数改良农具，就是我国农业机械制造的丰富资料。河北省安国县祁州公社农业机械厂采取种试验田的办法，与能工巧匠结合一起，总结了几年来分散、零星的工具改革的经验，针对园田化以后的新情况，制造成功适合园田化耕作制度的耕耙、播种、筑畦联合机，把五道工序的工作，一次作完。一天的工作量就能节省七百多个劳动力。这个生动的事实表明：种试验田这个马克思列宁主义的领导方法，同样适用于农业机械的设计、制造工作。
    有的企业的领导人有这样的看法：“生产农具农械，三个螺丝钉，两个犁铧片，零零星星，影响工业水平的提高。”这种看法是否正确，到农村中去种一下试验田就得到回答了。通过种试验田，了解农村需要，总结农村工具改革经验以后，就能结合当地的特点设计产品；生产出来以后又经过试验，在使用时又经过实际操作的检验，不断改进缺点，这样，工厂的设计、生产水平，不仅不会受到妨碍，而且会不断提高。巨鹿县邢家湾农业机械厂原来只有二十台“老掉牙”的旧机床，二百多名工人，只能生产铁锨、锄板等简单产品，最大的产品是五轮水车。开始生产农业机械时，这个厂没有图纸，没有样板。于是职工就深入农村总结工具改革的经验，在支援农业中不断武装自己，现在已发展成为拥有五十二台元车、万能铣床等技术装备和四百七十多名工人的农业机械厂，不仅能修配大型农业机械，还能设计制造三十五种农业机械。这个事实不就是很好的证明吗？
    在农村中“种试验田”的办法，是不是仅仅适用于县社工业，一些大型企业就可以不必这样作呢？大型企业不但同样可以这样作，而且应当这样作。大型企业，生产的产品相对固定，而且是大批生产，供应的地区一般包括也比较广，这都是事实。但是，它同样需要根据农业生产的不断发展来不断改进自己的产品，不断地精益求精。这些大型企业在设计、制造新产品中也同样应该注意了解农村的需要，充分重视工具改革的经验。天津拖拉机制造厂在生产拖拉机的过程中，同农村人民公社建立了经常的联系，根据人民公社的意见，改进了一些主要零件的结构和铸造方法等，使拖拉机的质量不断提高，就是很好的证明。
    农业机械工厂在农村中“种试验田”的深远意义，在于进一步加强工农联盟。党中央和毛泽东同志一再告诉我们：农民同盟军的问题，不论在革命时期和建设时期，都有着极端的重要性。全国解放以后，我国工农联盟已经经历了两个阶段。第一个阶段是把工农联盟建立在彻底实行土地改革的基础上；第二个阶段就是经过合作化，把工农联盟建立在社会主义的所有制的基础上。现在，我国工农联盟随着人民公社化和社会主义建设新阶段的开始又进入了一个新的阶段。在这个阶段中，中心的内容之一就是大规模地逐步实现农业技术改造。在这个新的阶段里，进一步密切工农之间的友谊就更加重要。列宁早就讲过：“在城市工人与农村劳动者之间建立相互的关系，确定一种可以很容易建立起来的友好互助形式，这是我们的责任，是执政工人阶级的基本任务之一。”在新的基础上加强工农联盟的方式很多。农业机械厂采取“种试验田”的办法，使工人、农民建立经常的联系，就是一种良好的形式。河北各地采取这种办法的结果，工农关系进一步密切了。公社有了困难，工厂派工人下去解决。工厂发生某些原材料和劳动力不足的问题，公社就帮助解决。工厂制造了新产品，向公社报捷；农民生产上创造了新成绩，也向工厂报捷。工人农民在共同加速农业技术改造中建立了亲密的友谊，工农联盟在新的基础上日臻巩固。
    采取“种试验田”的办法，是加强工业同农业的协作、工人同农民的友谊的一个好经验。最近，河北省领导机关已将这种办法形成制度，每一个农业机械厂，至少同一个公社或者一个生产队建立经常联系。这是一个很有意义的措施。如果全国各地的农业机械厂以及和农业机械生产有关的各种工厂都这样做，那末，完全可以预料，我国农业技术改造的速度必将大大加快，工人和农民的友谊和团结必将进一步加强。
