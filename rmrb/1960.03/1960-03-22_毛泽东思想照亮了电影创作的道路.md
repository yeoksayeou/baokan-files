　　Our films should primarily focus on praising the heroic figures of the contemporary socialist era, while also appropriately highlighting historical people's heroes and advanced figures. Good historical films are also educational for the audience. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "For the past hundred years, the disaster-stricken Chinese nation has seen its outstanding figures struggle and sacrifice, one after another, exploring the truth of saving the country and the people, which is truly admirable and moving." Indeed, we have a responsibility to portray them in film.

　　The first chapter of China's admirable and moving history of the past century usually begins with the "Opium War." However, my understanding of Chinese history is insufficient, especially regarding the history of the Chinese Communist Party and the nearly hundred years of modern Chinese history since the Opium War. Therefore, although I want to do this work, I still lack the courage.

　　In 1951, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, a critique of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" was launched. Through the critique, the reactionary nature of the film was thoroughly exposed. The author used the reactionary viewpoints of bourgeois reformism to distort the history of the motherland, making the film a "reactionary propaganda that slandered peasant revolutionary struggles, slandered Chinese history, and slandered the Chinese nation." This critique greatly educated me. From that time on, I became aware of my ignorance of the history of the motherland and began to realize how serious the harm could be if we filmmakers handled historical subjects without a correct stance and viewpoints, violating historical materialism.

　　An editorial in "People's Daily" calling on everyone to pay attention to the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" once pointed out: "...Our authors do not study what new socio-economic forms, new class forces, new figures, and new ideas have emerged in China in the more than one hundred years since the Opium War of 1840, struggling against the old socio-economic forms and their superstructure (politics, culture, etc.), to determine what should be praised or eulogized, what should not be praised or eulogized, and what should be opposed."

　　Although this passage is aimed at problems in film creation, it has a very profound and comprehensive significance—it elevates the issue to the fundamental issue of the struggle between two lines on the literary and artistic front. At the same time, it also points out the direction for those who create films on Chinese historical subjects.

　　In response to the reactionary propaganda of "The Life of Wu Xun," Chinese filmmakers shot a story film "Song Jingshi," reflecting the peasant uprising led by Song Jingshi, a peasant hero from Luxi who lived in the same era and village as Wu Xun, to help eliminate the influence of the reactionary propaganda of "The Life of Wu Xun." I participated in the directing work of this film. Following that, I made a vow to shoot films depicting the Opium War and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, starting with the Opium War.

　　The period around the Opium War was a period of tremendous changes in Chinese society. With the invasion of capitalism into China, very drastic changes took place within Chinese society, and national and class contradictions became very acute. It is not simple to sort out the clues of these complex struggles, grasp them accurately, and then condense them into a short film. At first, I faced a vast amount of historical material and couldn't find my way around, not knowing where to start.

　　The film literary script "The Opium War" written by Comrade Ye Yuan solved the above problems for us and can be used as the basis for filming. In October 1956, film editors Li Hongxin and Chen Qingsun and we formed a group to jointly revise the script.

　　The first question we encountered was: What was the most important contradiction in Chinese society during the Opium War? How should the film express this contradiction?

　　Around the Opium War, there was the struggle between the capitulationist faction headed by Mu Zhang'a and the anti-smoking faction headed by Lin Zexu, the struggle between the Manchu and Han nationalities, the struggle between the broad masses of the people and the feudal rulers, and the struggle between British capitalism and Chinese feudalism. These struggles evolved into complex events, intertwined and dazzling. To sort out this vast historical material, we must first find out what was the main contradiction at that time, and then we can decide what to choose and discard.

　　In summary, there were only two main struggles at that time: one was the anti-British struggle (anti-imperialism), and the other was the anti-Qing struggle (anti-feudalism), which are well known; these two struggles are related to each other, which is also well known.

　　The question is: In this specific historical period, are these two struggles parallel? Or do they have their own priorities in different stages? Which is secondary? Which is primary? These questions were unclear to us at the beginning of our creation.

　　Therefore, in the script discussion, the group launched a fierce debate: One of the group members (who later degenerated into a rightist), Lu Dang, believed that the Opium War was the beginning of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. The struggle began with opposition to the British invasion, but because the Qing court later succumbed to the British invaders and "turned the knife against the Chinese people," the focus of the struggle had to turn to opposing the Qing court. Therefore, the published literary script was written in this way: The anti-smoking faction represented by Lin Zexu initially received the approval of Daoguang and the support of the people, and launched a vigorous anti-smoking and anti-British movement. Later, the Qing court kneeled down to beg for peace in front of the British invaders, and Manchu officials (Yixiang) (Yinglong) arrested and killed anti-British people. The focus of the script gradually shifted to opposing the surrender of the Qing Dynasty rulers. There is a passage in the play that writes about the Manchu officials arresting the sailors and then binding Kuang Dongshan (one of the leaders of the "Pingying Corps" in the play) to the execution ground and beheading him:

　　Yixiang raises the command flag:
　　"By order: Execute on the spot the unruly people Kuang Dongshan, Yu Jiu, Zhang Tian... etc. who resisted arrest to show the public!" In the firelight, the soldiers shouted loudly: "Hai!" They pressed Kuang Dongshan and others to the ground and raised their knives...
　　With a shrill scream, Sister-in-law A-kuan fainted at Lin Zexu's feet...
　　The little boy cried beside her...
　　Lin Zexu glared angrily, and after a while, he sighed, closed his eyes, calmed down, and silently mounted his horse again...
　　On the official road north of Guangzhou, a group of people walked silently, walking into the distance... (See "Opium War" published in "People's Literature" in May and June 1957)

　　The anti-British hero was beheaded so bloodily! Lin Zexu quietly and dejectedly withdrew from the stage of struggle! The reason for writing this is, as Lu Dang said in a letter to me: "To specifically tell the audience through images that the historical condition that anti-imperialism must oppose feudalism has matured."

　　We sent the script to some historical research groups and experts for guidance and help. We were happy to receive a detailed reply from the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which put forward fundamental opinions on the script:

　　"First of all, we believe that the purpose of this script is not clear enough. Since this script is named 'Lin Zexu,' it should educate the people in patriotism through this historical figure, through the anti-smoking movement and anti-British struggle that he presided over and influenced. Therefore, it must firmly grasp the main contradiction at that time—the contradiction between the Chinese nation and foreign aggressors, and concentrate and highlight it through artistic processing and rendering. However, this script adopted such a processing method in order to prominently express the positive historical figure of Lin Zexu: it deliberately exaggerated the contradiction between the Manchu and Han ruling classes, and beautified Lin Zexu by vilifying all Manchu rulers. This makes the purpose of this script a problem. Is it to expose the contradiction between the Manchu and Han people? Or to carry out patriotic education for the masses? Obviously, it should be the latter, not the former. Inappropriately emphasizing the Manchu-Han contradiction is meaningless today, and may be politically harmful."

　　Due to the above reminder, we re-studied Comrade Mao Zedong's "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On Contradiction," and we were ideologically armed from his brilliant dialectical viewpoints on the specific evaluation and handling of problems in this historical period. Comrade Mao Zedong said:

　　"If there are many contradictions in any process, one of them must be the main one, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are secondary and subordinate. Therefore, in studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, it is necessary to do everything possible to find its main contradiction. Grasping this main contradiction solves all problems." ("On Contradiction") "In semi-colonial countries like China, the relationship between major and minor contradictions presents a complex situation.
　　"When imperialism launches a war of aggression against such a country, the various classes within the country, except for a few traitors, can temporarily unite to wage a national war against imperialism. At this time, the contradiction between imperialism and this country becomes the main contradiction, and all contradictions between the various classes within the country (including the main contradiction between the feudal system and the masses) are temporarily reduced to a secondary and subordinate position. China's Opium War in 1840, the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, and the current Sino-Japanese War all have this kind of situation." ("On Contradiction")
　　"The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation, and the contradiction between feudalism and the broad masses of the people, are the main contradictions in modern Chinese society. Of course, there are other contradictions, such as the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and the contradictions within the reactionary ruling class. And the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the most important contradiction among all contradictions." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party")

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's works clarified our confused thoughts at once, and also fundamentally corrected the theme of the script. So we re-revised the script, removed the original Manchu-Han contradiction, and took the contradiction between the Chinese nation and British capitalism as the main line, and placed other contradictions in the corresponding positions. With a clear theme, there was a criterion for choosing and discarding historical materials, and the plot also had a correct development clue, thus solving the first key issue related to the ideological nature of the film.

　　The second key issue is: How to express this central contradiction between British capitalism and the Chinese nation?

　　This contradiction consists of two aspects: one is the aggression of British capitalism, and the other is the resistance of the Chinese nation. Which side is dominant in these two aspects? In which direction does the contradiction transform? At first, we were all vague. Lu Dang emphasized writing about the victory of the British invaders in a literary script (unpublished)—after the Qing court succumbed to beg for peace, the British invaders drove straight into Guangzhou:

　　Flames soared into the sky above Guangzhou.
　　In the firelight, Qishan, Yu Kun, and others knelt on the ground to welcome the British invaders into the city.
　　A white flag was flying over Guangzhou, and countless angry eyes gradually appeared on the flag, led by Lin Zexu.
　　Commentary: "Remember, let us always remember, this is the beginning of capitalist aggression against China, turning our motherland into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. ...We must never forget these executioners who smeared the blood of the Chinese people, this painful historical period." —The end.

　　The play ends like this. The focus of the theme of the script is on the aggression of capitalism, on the dim-witted and incompetent Qing Dynasty attacking the resistance faction headed by Lin Zexu, suppressing the anti-British movement of the broad masses of the people, and kneeling down to beg for peace from the invaders, rather than on the Chinese people's successive resistance. In this way, the main contradiction of the script was dragged back to the old position, placing the Manchu-Han contradiction above the Sino-British contradiction. In this way, although the script can arouse people's hatred for capitalism and feudalism, the artistic effect is negative. What is particularly important is that the vigorous anti-British movement of the Guangzhou people in history was rendered into a dark and desperate tragedy, a defeatist tragedy! This is another matter of principle.

　　In our discussion of dealing with this key issue, Comrade Mao Zedong's works still gave us weapons.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The process of the combination of imperialism and Chinese feudalism to turn China into a semi-colony and colony is also the process of the Chinese people's resistance to imperialism and its running dogs. From the Opium War, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement... to the current War of Resistance Against Japan, all show the tenacious spirit of resistance of the Chinese people who are unwilling to succumb to imperialism and its running dogs."
(The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party) Chairman Mao pointed out that this process includes two aspects, and also pointed out that the Chinese people's spirit of resistance is the driving force for historical development.

　　This is the undeniable historical truth of China in the past century. Moreover, literature and art are weapons for educating the people and "promoting the people to unite and struggle." Therefore, on the basis of historical truth, it also requires artistic truth, that is, what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The life reflected in literary and artistic works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal." And the defeatist ending of the script is obviously neither historically true nor artistically true. At the same time, it cannot play the role of educating the people, and it is even harmful.

　　At that time, we were inspired by Comrade Mao Zedong's works to negate the above defeatist ending, and then re-processed it from the perspective of the Chinese people's resistance, and as a result, the entire spirit of the play changed.

　　Regarding this issue, I recall with infinite gratitude the close care and guidance of the leading comrades to our work. In the spring of 1958, when the film "Lin Zexu" had just begun filming, Premier Zhou Enlai specially entrusted the relevant leading comrades from Beijing to bring a heroic epic about the anti-British battle of the Sanyuanli "Pingying Corps" that he had obtained in Guangzhou not long before, and instructed us to study it carefully and write well about the line of the Guangzhou people's uprising against the British. The poem was printed on a single page of poetry paper:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sanyuanli
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(See Wei Pingsong's poetry collection)
　　The sound in front of Sanyuanli is like thunder, tens of thousands of people come at the same time!
　　Righteousness gives rise to anger, anger gives rise to courage, the villagers unite to destroy the strong thieves.
　　Every family's houses must be defended, without waiting for the sound of drums, the crowd becomes energized,
　　Women are also brave when they are united, plows and hoes in their hands are all weapons.
　　The villages are divided into near and far with colorful flags, dozens and hundreds of teams along the stream and mountains.
　　The Yi soldiers looked at each other and suddenly changed color, the black flag died and it was difficult to survive (note).
　　The Yi soldiers rely only on guns and cannons, where people's hearts meet, heaven's will arrives,
　　A sudden downpour in the clear sky, the fierce Yi have nothing to use to their violence.
　　Not only firearms are useless, the Yi feet are not accustomed to walking on slippery mud,
　　The lower ones struggle hard in the fields, the higher ones worry about falling on the hills.
　　There is a Yi chief with an especially ugly face, wearing an elephant skin as armor wrapped thickly around his body;
　　One spear has already pierced the throat of Chang Di, and for ten days the head of Zhi Zhi is still hanging.
　　Everyone wants to escape without wings, it is easy to eliminate their leaders;
　　I don't understand how the giant net opened, and the dried fish were able to swim away leisurely.
　　Wei Jiang made peace and resolved worries, the wind people generously composed poems of common hatred,
　　How can the day of the flourishing golden urn be like the gold-painted tribute scheme?
　　(Note) Original note: Yi soldiers use black flags when fighting to the death. It happened that someone was holding the Seven Star Flag of the temple, and the Yi were shocked and said: "Those who fight to the death have arrived!"

　　This valuable historical poem not only reminds us to firmly grasp the historical mainstream of the people's anti-British struggle as the theme of the film, but also directly provides many vivid creative materials. Many of the detailed descriptions of the anti-British battle seen in the film now are derived from this poem.

　　The film takes Lin Zexu as the central figure, but the creators of history are the people. Therefore, in the film, the role of Lin Zexu and the power of the people must be placed in a correct relationship. This is a matter of ideology, and it is also a matter of artistry—because it inevitably involves a series of issues such as the structure of the whole play, the relationship between characters, the development of the plot, and the ending. The reason why Lin Zexu was able to ban smoking and resist the British was mainly because his actions were in line with the interests of the people, and the people supported him. The main plot in the film is structured through this point of view: intercepting Dent is based on the people, burning opium is based on the people, building coastal defense works is based on the people, and defending against the enemy at sea is inseparable from the people. From Lin Zexu's perspective (the perspective of the ruling class), he believes that "the hearts of the people can be used," but in essence, Lin Zexu would accomplish nothing without the support of the people. After Lin Zexu was demoted to Yili, the great cause of resisting the British all fell on the "Pingying Corps." This involves an important question: How should this play end? Should the play end with Lin Zexu, or should it end with the people? This question was discussed and debated a lot within the crew. At first, I thought: The play begins with Lin Zexu and ends with Lin Zexu, which seems more complete in artistic conception. Therefore, one of the drafts was written like this:

　　On Niulangang in Sanyuanli, peasants holding primitive weapons surrounded the British soldiers on the mountain...
　　Lin Zexu stood on the river bank, looking solemn, with infinite reluctance, looking around.
　　The old housekeeper carried a load of books and luggage onto the boat.
　　Two committee members urged beside him: "Let's go!"
　　Lin Zexu silently boarded the boat.
　　The boat leaves the shore.
　　Lin Zexu reluctantly looked at the beautiful rivers and mountains.
　　In the distance, overlapping mountains and endless rivers...
　　A flat boat disappeared into the mountains...—The end.

　　After writing it, the comrades felt unhappy after reading it. Although this ending can arouse the audience's sympathy for Lin Zexu's personal fate, they also feel dim about the fate of the country and the nation. Although Lin Zexu withdrew from the stage of struggle, the people's anti-British movement did not die, but instead developed more deeply and more magnificently! So we changed it to the current ending:

　　Far away on the mountain road, outside the long pavilion, Lin Zexu reined in his horse, looking at the thrilling battle in Sanyuanli!
　　Behind him were two exiled committee members and two loads of luggage.
　　Lin Zexu was filled with mixed feelings, with tears in his eyes, turned his horse's head, and rushed to the distance...
　　Mai Kuang held high the banner of the "Pingying Corps," rushing straight from the mountainside to the top of the mountain—
　　Several groups of people headed by Kuang Dongshan and Sister-in-law A-kuan all rushed to meet under this banner—
　　Voice-over: "The opium imported by foreign aggressors not only did not paralyze the Chinese people, but aroused them! The Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle began on this day!"
　　A group of British soldiers huddled around a British flag, rushing and fleeing wildly behind the mountain.
　　The British national flag was tottering and gradually disappeared behind the mountain...
　　The heroic people meet on the majestic mountain top!
　　The banner of the "Pingying Corps" fluttered in the sky, beckoning...

　　This ending reveals Lin Zexu's historical limitations and tragedy on the one hand, and highlights the revolutionary optimism and idealism of the masses of the people on the other hand. These are all in line with the development of history afterwards: The struggle of the "Pingying Corps" was suppressed for ten years, and the Chinese people raised high the banner of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and carried out a more magnificent revolutionary cause!

　　From my participation in the writing and directing work of the film "Lin Zexu," I have a deeper understanding of the importance of literary and art workers striving to study Marxism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

### 毛泽东思想照亮了电影创作的道路

    毛泽东思想照亮了电影创作的道路
    郑君里
    我们的电影应该以它的主要篇幅来歌颂当今社会主义时代的英雄人物，同时也应该用适当的篇幅去表扬历史上的人民英雄和先进人物。好的历史题材的影片，对于观众也是有教育意义的。毛泽东同志说：“灾难深重的中华民族，一百年来，其优秀人物奋斗牺牲，前仆后继，摸索救国救民的真理，是可歌可泣的。”的确，我们有责任要在电影里表现他们。
    中国百年来的可歌可泣的历史的第一章，通常是从“鸦片战争”算起。但是，我对中国历史学习得很不够，特别是对中国共产党的历史和鸦片战争以来的中国近百年史，懂得太少。因此，我虽则想做这一工作，也还是勇气不足的。
    1951年，在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，展开了对反动影片“武训传”的批判。通过批判，彻底揭露了这部影片的反动性。作者运用资产阶级的改良主义的反动观点篡改了祖国的历史，使影片成为“诬蔑农民革命斗争，诬蔑中国历史，诬蔑中国民族的反动宣传”。这个批判给了我很大的教育，从那时起，我才一方面警觉自己对祖国历史愚昧无知，一方面开始认识到，我们电影工作者处理历史题材，如果没有正确的立场、观点，违反历史唯物主义，其危害有多么严重。
    “人民日报”的一篇号召大家重视电影“武训传”的讨论的社论曾经指出：“……我们的作者们也不去研究自从一八四○年鸦片战争以来的一百多年中，中国发生了一些什么向着旧的社会经济形态及其上层建筑（政治、文化等等）作斗争的新的社会经济形态，新的阶级力量，新的人物和新的思想，而去决定什么东西是应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是不应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是应当反对的。”
    这段话虽然是针对电影创作中的问题，但具有非常深刻的概括意义——它把问题提高到文艺战线上两条路线斗争的根本性的问题，同时，也给创作中国历史题材影片的人指出了方向。
    针对“武训传”的反动宣传，我国电影工作者拍摄了一部反映与武训同时代、同乡井的一位农民英雄宋景诗在鲁西领导农民起义的故事影片“宋景诗”，以有助于肃清“武训传”反动宣传的影响。我参加了这部影片的导演工作。接着，我立下愿心，要拍摄表现鸦片战争和太平天国的影片，并且从鸦片战争拍起。
    鸦片战争前后是中国社会发生巨大变化的时期。随着资本主义的侵入中国，中国社会内部发生了非常剧烈的变化，民族矛盾和阶级矛盾十分尖锐。我们要把这些复杂的斗争的头绪理清楚，掌握得不偏不倚，最后又压缩到短短的一部影片里，并不简单。起初我面对着汗牛充栋的史料，摸不到边，不知从何下手。
    叶元同志写的“鸦片战争”电影文学剧本替我们解决了以上的难题，可以作为拍摄影片的基础。1956年10月，电影编辑李洪辛、陈庆孙两位同志和我们一起组成一个小组，共同进行剧本的修改工作。
    我们碰到的第一个问题是：鸦片战争时期中国社会最主要的矛盾是什么？影片应该如何表现这个矛盾？
    围绕着鸦片战争，当时有以穆彰阿为首的投降派和以林则徐为首的禁烟派的斗争，有满族和汉族的斗争，有广大人民和封建统治者的斗争，有英国资本主义和中国封建主义的斗争。这些斗争又演化为错综复杂的事件，相互牵连，叫人眼花缭乱。要把这浩瀚的历史素材理出个头绪，首先要找到什么是当时的主要矛盾，然后才能决定素材的取舍。
    归纳起来，当时主要的斗争不外有两个：一是反英斗争（反帝），一是反清斗争（反封建），这是大家所熟知的；这两个斗争互有关联，这也是大家所熟知的。
    问题在于：在这一特定的历史时期中，这两个斗争是平行的？还是在不同的阶段中各有主次？孰次要？孰主要？这些问题在我们创作之初，是认识不清的。
    因此，在剧本讨论中，小组展开了激烈的争论：小组成员之一（后来堕落成为右派分子）的吕宕认为鸦片战争是中国人民反帝反封建斗争的开端，斗争是从反对英国侵略开始的，但由于清廷后来对英国侵略者屈服，“把刀锋转向中国人民”，因而斗争的矛头不得不转向反对清廷。因此，发表的文学剧本是这样写的：以林则徐为代表的禁烟派起先得到道光的赞同和老百姓的支持，展开如火如荼的禁烟和反英运动，其后，清廷在英国侵略者面前屈膝求和，满族官员（奕湘）（英隆）捕杀抗英人民，剧本的重心便渐渐转到反对清朝统治者的投降。剧中有一段写满族官员大捕水勇之后，把邝东山（剧中“平英团”首领之一）绑赴法场，斩首正法：
    奕湘举起大令：
    “奉令：把拒捕刁民邝东山、于九、张天……等就地正法示众！”火光影里，营兵们大呼一声：“嗐！”把邝东山等人按倒在地，举起了刀……
    一声凄厉的尖叫，阿宽嫂晕倒在林则徐脚边……
    小伢子在她身旁号哭着……
    林则徐怒目而视，半晌，他长叹一声，闭上眼睛镇静了一下，他默默地又上了马……
    广州城北的官道上，一行人影默默地走着，向远处走着……（见1957年5、6月份“人民文学”刊出的“鸦片战争”）
    抗英的英雄就这样血淋淋地被斩首了！林则徐就此悄悄地、垂头丧气地退出斗争的舞台了！其所以要这样写的原因，正如吕宕在写给我的信上所说的：“通过形象具体地告诉观众，反帝必须反封建这样一个历史条件已经成熟了。”
    我们曾把剧本送给一些历史研究团体和专家，请求指导和帮助。我们高兴地收到了中国科学院历史研究所第三所一份周详的答复，对剧本提出了根本性的意见：
    “首先，我们认为这个剧本的目的性不够清楚。这个剧本既以‘林则徐’命名，就应该通过这个历史人物，通过他所主持和影响的禁烟运动和反英斗争这些重大的历史事件，对人民群众进行爱国主义教育。因此它必须紧紧地抓住当时的主要矛盾——中华民族和外国侵略者的矛盾，经过艺术的加工和渲染，把它集中突出起来。但是，这个剧本为了突出地表现林则徐这个正面的历史人物，却采取了这样一种处理方法：它故意夸大了满汉统治阶级之间的矛盾，用丑化所有的满族统治者来美化林则徐。这样就使这个剧本的目的性成了问题。它究竟为了揭发满汉之间的矛盾？还是对群众进行爱国主义教育？显然应该是后者而不是前者。不适当地强调满汉矛盾在今天是没有意义的，而且政治上可能是有害的。”
    由于以上的提醒，我们又重新研读毛泽东同志的“中国革命和中国共产党”和“矛盾论”，从他的关于这一历史时期的具体评价和处理问题的光辉的辩证观点里，我们得到了思想的武装。毛泽东同志说：
    “任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”（矛盾论）“半殖民地的国家如中国，其主要矛盾和非主要矛盾的关系呈现着复杂的情况。
    “当着帝国主义向这种国家举行侵略战争的时候，这种国家的内部各阶级，除开一些叛国分子以外，能够暂时地团结起来举行民族战争去反对帝国主义。这时，帝国主义和这种国家之间的矛盾成为主要的矛盾，而这种国家内部各阶级的一切矛盾（包括封建制度和人民大众之间这个主要矛盾在内），便都暂时地降到次要和服从的地位。中国一八四○年的鸦片战争，1894年的中日战争，一九○○年的义和团战争和目前的中日战争，都有这种情形。”（矛盾论）
    “帝国主义和中华民族的矛盾，封建主义和人民大众的矛盾，这些就是近代中国社会的主要的矛盾。当然还有别的矛盾，例如资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾，反动统治阶级内部的矛盾。而帝国主义和中华民族的矛盾，乃是各种矛盾中的最主要的矛盾。”（中国革命和中国共产党）
    毛泽东同志的著作一下子澄清了我们的混乱思想，使我们也从根本上端正了剧本的主题思想。于是我们重新修改剧本，抽掉了原有的汉满矛盾，把中华民族和英国资本主义的矛盾作为主线，把其他的矛盾安放在相应的地位上。有了明确的主题思想，处理历史素材就有了取舍的准绳，剧情也有了正确的发展线索，这样就解决了有关影片思想性的第一个关键问题。
    第二个关键问题是：如何表现英国资本主义和中华民族之间的这一中心矛盾？
    这个矛盾由两个方面构成：一是英国资本主义的侵略，一是中华民族的反抗。这两面中哪一面是主导？矛盾向哪一方向转化？起先我们都很含糊。吕宕在一次文学本（未发表）中强调写英国侵略者胜利的一面——在清廷屈膝求和之后，英国侵略者长驱直入广州城：
    广州城上火光冲天。
    火光里，琦善、豫坤等人跪伏在地上迎接英国侵略者入城。
    广州城上扬着一面白旗，旗上渐渐显现以林则徐为首的无数人的愤怒的眼睛。
    解说词：“记住吧，让我们永远记住，这是资本主义侵略中国，把我们的祖国变成了半封建、半殖民地的开端。……我们永远也不要忘记这些涂满了中国人民鲜血的刽子手，这一个惨痛的历史年代。”——剧终。
    戏就这样结束。剧本主题思想的重点放在资本主义的侵略，放在昏瞆无能的清朝打击以林则徐为首的抵抗派，镇压广大人民的抗英运动，对侵略者屈膝请降，而不放在中国人民前仆后继的反抗上面。这样，剧本的主要矛盾又给拖回到老地位，把满汉矛盾放在中英矛盾之上。这样，尽管剧本可以激发起人们对资本主义和封建主义的仇恨，但是在艺术效果上是消极的。特别重要的是，历史上广州人民轰轰烈烈的抗英运动被渲染为一个阴暗的、绝望的悲剧，失败主义的悲剧！这又是个原则性的问题。
    在我们处理这个关键问题的讨论中，仍然是毛泽东同志的著作给了我们武器。
    毛泽东同志说：“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程。从鸦片战争、太平天国运动……直至现在的抗日战争，都表现了中国人民不甘屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的顽强的反抗精神。”
  （中国革命和中国共产党）毛主席指出这个过程，包括了两个方面，也指出中国人民的反抗精神是历史向前发展的动力。
    这是中国近百年来无可否认的历史真实。而且文学艺术是教育人民，“推动人民走向团结和斗争”的武器，因而，它在历史真实的基础上，还要求艺术上的真实，即毛泽东同志所说的：“文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。”而剧本的失败主义结局的处理，很显然，是既没有历史真实性，也缺乏艺术真实性的，同时，也不能起教育人民的作用，甚至还有害。
    当时我们就是从毛泽东同志的著作里得到启发，否定了以上那个失败主义的结局，再从中国人民反抗的角度加以重新处理，结果整个戏的精神面貌为之一变。
    关于这个问题，我怀着无限感激的心情回忆起领导同志对我们工作的亲切关怀和指导。1958年春天，影片“林则徐”刚开始拍摄的时候，周恩来总理就从北京特地托有关领导同志捎来了他不久之前在广州得到的一首有关三元里“平英团”抗英战斗的英雄史诗，叮嘱我们要好好地研究，要写好广州人民奋起抗英这一条线。那诗印在单页的诗笺上：
                  三元里
          （见维屏松的诗集）
    三元里前声若雷，千众万众同时来！
    因义生愤愤生勇，乡民合力强徒摧。
    家家田庐须保卫，不待鼓声群作气，
    妇女齐心亦健儿，犁锄在手皆兵器。
    乡分远近旗斑斓，什队百队沿溪山。
    众夷相视忽变色，黑旗死仗难生还（注）。
    夷兵所恃惟枪炮，人心合处天心到，
    晴空骤雨忽倾盆，凶夷无所施其暴。
    岂特火器无所施，夷足不惯行滑泥，
    下者田塍苦踯躅，高者冈阜愁颠挤。
    中有夷酋貌尤丑，象皮作甲裹身厚；
    一戈已桩长狄喉，十日犹悬郅支首。
    纷纷欲遁无双翅，歼厥渠魁真易事；
    不解何由巨网开，枯鱼竟得悠然逝。
    魏绛和戎且解忧，风人慷慨赋同仇，
    如何全盛金瓯日，却类金绘岁币谋？
    （注）原注：夷打死仗则用黑旗，适有执神庙七星旗者，夷惊曰：“打死仗者至矣！”
    这首宝贵的史诗不仅提醒我们要牢牢地掌握着人民抗英这股历史的主流，作为影片的主题思想，同时也直接提供了许多鲜明生动的创作资料。现在在影片中所见到的抗英战斗的许多细节描写，都是从这首诗里演化出来的。
    影片以林则徐为中心人物，然而历史的创造者却是人民，因此，在影片里，必须要把林则徐的作用和人民的力量放在一个正确的关系上。这是个思想性的问题，也是个艺术性的问题——因为它必然牵涉到全剧结构、人物关系、剧情发展、结尾等一系列的问题。林则徐之所以能禁烟、抗英，主要是因为他的行动符合人民的利益，人民支持了他。影片中主要的情节是通过这个观点去结构的：截捕颠地是靠人民，焚烟是靠人民，修海防工事靠人民，海上破敌更少不了人民。从林则徐的角度（统治阶级的角度）看来，他认为“民心可用”，而实质上，林则徐如果得不到人民的支持，便一事无成。当林则徐被谪伊犁之后，抗英的伟大事业就全部落到“平英团”的身上。这就牵涉到一个重要的问题：这个戏应该怎么样结束？戏应该结束在林则徐身上，还是结束在人民身上？这个问题在摄制组内经过不少的推敲和争论。起初我认为：戏以林则徐始，以林则徐终，在艺术构思上显得比较完整些，因此，有一次稿本是这样写的：
    在三元里的牛栏岗上，满山遍野的手执原始武器的农民把英兵团团围住。……
    林则徐站在江岸，神态肃穆，带着无限恋栈之情，眺望周遭。
    老家人挑着一担书箧行囊上船。
    两个委员执事在旁催促：“走吧！”
    林则徐默默登舟。
    船离岸。
    林则徐依依地眺望大好江山。
    远处重重叠叠的崇山峻岭，大江蜿蜒不尽……
    一叶扁舟，没入万山之中……——剧终。
    写完之后，同志们看了，感到心情不畅快。这个结局虽能引起观众对林则徐的个人命运的同情，但对国家民族的命运却随而感到黯淡无光。林则徐虽然退出了斗争舞台，人民的抗英运动却没有夭折，相反地是更深入地、更加波澜壮阔地向前发展了！于是我们改成现在的结局：
    远远的山道上，长亭外，林则徐勒着马，了望着三元里这场惊心动魄的战斗！
    他身后跟着两位发配委员和两挑行李。
    林则徐百感交集，眼里含着泪，拨转马头，奔赴远方……
    麦宽高举着“平英团”的大纛，从山腰直冲山顶——
    以邝东山和阿宽嫂为首的几路人马，都奔到这面大纛下会师——
    画外音：“外国侵略者输入的鸦片非但没有麻醉中国人民，反而促醒了他们！中国人民反帝反封建的斗争，从这一天开始了！”
    一簇英兵拥着一面英国旗在山顶豕突狼奔，向山后夺路乱窜。
    英国国旗摇摇欲坠，渐渐隐没到山后……
    英雄的人民在雄伟的山头上会师！
    “平英团”的大纛在万里长空下飘扬，招展……
    这个结局一方面揭示林则徐的历史的局限性和悲剧，一方面突出了人民群众的革命的乐观主义和理想主义。这些都是和以后历史的发展相符的：“平英团”的斗争被镇压了十年，中国人民又高高举起“太平天国”的大纛，进行了规模更伟大的革命事业！
    从自己参加电影“林则徐”的编导工作中，更深地体会到文艺工作者努力学习马克思主义和毛泽东同志著作的重要性。
