    Melting the Individual into the Great Collective
    Albanian Woman Worker Vito Awarded the Title of Socialist Labor Hero
    Vito Konomi is the first Albanian textile worker to initiate the idea of advanced workers helping less advanced ones. Due to this noble, selfless communist spirit and her enthusiasm for labor, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania awarded her the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Hero" on the eve of last year's celebration of the 15th anniversary of the country's liberation.
    When we visited this female hero and asked her to talk in detail about her exemplary deeds, she blushed a little and said modestly, "I am just an ordinary woman worker, what should I say!" "Today's achievements and all my personal happiness are bestowed by the Labor Party. I can only study more, better improve my production skills, and dedicate all my energy to the beloved Party."
    Vito was the daughter of a poor peasant in the past. When she first stepped into the textile factory, she was only thirteen years old and knew nothing about machines. However, under the education and cultivation of the Party for ten years, she studied diligently, completed the textile school courses, and grew from an extremely ordinary apprentice to an outstanding production team leader, and successively won medals twice for her excellent achievements. In 1953, Vito was honorably accepted as a member of the Albanian Labor Party. Today, her initiative of advanced workers helping less advanced ones has become a bright red banner across the country, and the backward production team she leads has also leaped forward to become an advanced production team. Vito said, "In the past, the landlords said we were 'stupid and only fit to live with cows,' but the beloved Party has cultivated us into new people with culture and education."
    Vito was inspired by the example of the Soviet Labor Hero Gaganova to propose going to a backward production team. Vito's past monthly income was nearly 10,000 leks, but in the backward production team, it was less than 6,000 leks. However, she did not care about personal gains and losses and was the first to submit an application to the Party Committee to work in a backward production team.
    After arriving at the backward Fifth Production Team, a series of problems troubled her: the team members were lax in discipline, some members violated operating procedures, did not care about the maintenance of the machines, the production process was very chaotic, often with thread breaks and dropped stitches, and many rejects. In response to this phenomenon, Vito first carried out education on correctly treating labor and loving labor, and at the same time, mobilized collective wisdom to find problems and think of solutions. Vito and the team members jointly researched a set of patrol route methods, which not only shortened the machine patrol time from five minutes to two or three minutes in the past, but also reduced thread breaks quickly by seven or eight tenths due to comprehensive and timely inspections, combining general and key inspections. Vito also proposed a system of frequent inspections and frequent cleaning, so the number of accidents decreased, and the reject rate and machine wear and tear were also greatly reduced. The amount of fallen cotton and waste cotton collected each day was reduced by half compared to the past. Under Vito's meticulous help, the production of the backward team quickly improved. In the first week after her assistance, the production plan of the backward team increased from only 76% in the past to 86%, and by the end of the month, the entire team had completed the production quota with a score of 106%. Now this team can overfulfill its plan every month.
    In the process of helping, Vito showed a high degree of comradely love. Xie Na and Hamno were two novices. In order to ensure that the entire team could move forward in step, Vito specialized in helping them, explaining to them again and again. In order to help an absentee girl, Vito personally went to her home to understand the situation and help her solve her difficulties. After work, she and the team members studied culture and entertained together like sisters. This quality of fraternal mutual assistance and selflessness deeply moved all the team members.
    The Party and trade union organizations attached great importance to Vito's initiative and continuously provided encouragement and support. The Tirana City Trade Union specially held a field meeting at the Stalin Textile Factory to promote her initiative. In a very short period of time, more than forty advanced workers throughout the factory voluntarily transferred to backward workshops and production teams following Vito. Now these workshops and teams have blossomed with communist fragrance. For example, the wool spinning factory has saved more than 850,000 leks in the past eight months due to the development of the movement of advanced workers helping less advanced ones. A backward production team assisted by advanced worker Sainali has increased from only 94% completion of the plan in the past to the current 128%.
    Currently, the movement of advanced workers helping less advanced ones has been promoted throughout the country. The communist style of not caring about personal rewards, not competing for fame and status, and melting oneself into the great collective is being increasingly promoted among the broad masses of workers in Albania.

### 把个人溶化在伟大的集体中  阿尔巴尼亚女工维托获得社会主义劳动英雄称号

    把个人溶化在伟大的集体中
    阿尔巴尼亚女工维托获得社会主义劳动英雄称号
    维托·科诺米是阿尔巴尼亚第一个倡议先进帮助落后的纺织女工，由于这种崇高的、不计较个人得失的共产主义风格和她的劳动热情，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团在去年庆祝祖国解放十五周年的前夕授予她“社会主义劳动英雄”的光荣称号。
    当我们去访问这位女英雄，请她详细地谈一谈自己的模范事迹时，她却红了一下脸，谦虚地说：“我只是一个平凡的女工，该怎么说呢！”“今天的成就和我个人所有的幸福都是劳动党赐予的，我只有更多地学习，更好地提高自己的生产技术，把我全部精力献给亲爱的党。”
    维托过去是一个贫农的女儿，当她第一次踏进纺织厂大门的时候，只有十三岁，对机器一窍不通。但是，十年来在党的教育和培养下，她勤学苦练，读完了纺织学校的课程，由一个极普通的徒工，成长为一个出色的生产队长，并且先后两次以优秀的成绩获得了奖章。1953年，维托又光荣地被接受为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党党员。今天她的先进帮助落后的倡议已成为全国一面鲜红的旗帜，她所领导的落后生产队也一跃而为先进的生产队了。维托说：“过去地主把我们说成是‘愚蠢的，只配和牛生活在一起的’，而亲爱的党却把我们培养成有文化、有教养的新人。”
    维托是在苏联劳动英雄加干诺娃的榜样鼓舞下提出到落后生产队去的。维托过去每个月的收入近一万里克，到落后生产队还不到六千里克。但是，她并没有计较个人的得失，第一个向党委会提出了到落后生产队去工作的申请。
    到了落后的第五生产队后，一连串的问题也曾使她苦恼：队员们纪律松弛，有的队员违反工序，不关心机器的保养，生产过程十分杂乱，时常断头、掉线，废品多。维托针对这种现象首先开展了正确对待劳动和热爱劳动的教育，同时发挥集体智慧找毛病想办法。维托和队员们共同研究出了一套巡回路线的方法，这样不仅巡回机器的时间从过去五分钟缩短到二、三分钟，而且由于全面和及时的检查，一般与重点结合的巡视，断头也就迅速地减少了十分之七八。维托又提出了勤检查、勤打扫的制度，因此事故减少了，废品率和机器的损耗也就随之大大地降低。单每天的落花和废花就比过去减少了一半。在维托精心的帮助下，落后队的生产很快就提高了。仅仅在她帮助后的第一个礼拜，落后队的生产计划就从过去仅完成76％，提高到了86％，到了月底全队已以106％的成绩完成了生产定额。现在这个队每个月都能超额完成计划。
    在帮助的过程中，维托表现了高度的同志友爱精神。谢娜和哈姆诺是两个生手，维托为使全队都能齐步前进，她就专门帮助她们，一遍又一遍地给她们讲解。为了帮助一个缺勤的姑娘，维托亲自到她家去了解情况，并且帮助她解决困难。工作完了，她就和队员们在一起像姊妹一样一块学文化、娱乐。这种友爱互助大公无私的品质，深深地感动了全体队员。
    党和工会组织非常重视维托的创举，不断给予鼓舞和支持。地拉那市工会为了推广她的倡议，特地在斯大林纺织厂召开了现场会议，很短的一个时间内，全厂就有四十多个先进工作者继维托之后自愿转到落后的车间和生产队去工作。现在这些车间和小队都开出了共产主义的芳香花朵。如毛纺厂由于开展了先进帮落后的运动，八个月来就节约了八十五万多里克。在先进工作者赛娜丽帮助下的一个落后生产队已从过去只完成计划的94％达到了目前的128％。
    目前先进帮助落后的运动已推向全国。不计个人报酬，不争名誉地位，把自己溶化在伟大的集体之中的共产主义风格，在阿尔巴尼亚广大工人中正日益发扬。
