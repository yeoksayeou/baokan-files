	Men, Women, Young and Old Love Sports; International Competitions Enjoy Great Fame
	Hungary Has Become a Sports Power
	Hungarian sports enjoy a very high international reputation. For more than a decade, people have called this country with a population of less than ten million a "sports power" in the world. Indeed, as long as you look through the international competition records, you will find that Hungarian athletes have achieved excellent results in almost all sports, whether it is football, basketball, table tennis, or fencing, gymnastics, track and field, and swimming, they are all at the forefront and famous in the world. Now there are more than 600,000 athletes in the country, that is to say, on average, one out of every sixteen residents in the country is an athlete with a good level. From cities to villages, from factories to mines, from institutions to schools, men, women, young and old have a strong interest in sports.
	In the past two or three years, mass sports activities have been further developed, and the technical level of athletes has also been significantly improved. In 1959, Hungarian athletes participated in the World Championships in twelve sports, winning a total of three championships, ten second places, and seven third places. They won eleven championships and seven second places in the European Championships in eleven sports.
	No matter what kind of sport, there are a large number of enthusiasts in Hungary, among which football is the most popular and welcomed by the masses.
	In 1953, the Hungarian football team defeated the British Royal Football Team, which had never been defeated on its own field for more than ninety years, with a score of six to three in London. Then, in 1954, Hungary defeated the British Royal Football Team again with an absolute advantage of seven to one in Budapest. Since then, the British Empire is no longer the "football kingdom" it boasts of.
	Hungarian fencing has a long-standing reputation in the world. In previous major international competitions, the brave and good-fighting Hungarian athletes have always been at the forefront, so people have become accustomed to calling Hungary a "nation good at fencing."
	The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party announced the policy program on sports work in July last year. The program pointed out that the main purpose of socialist sports is to use its unique means to assist in defending and building a socialist society, and to help cultivate new people with rich knowledge, noble morality, good physique, and love of labor. In the future, mass sports activities should be further carried out extensively so that men, women, young and old can regularly participate in sports activities.
	Under the correct leadership and enthusiastic care of the Party and the government, Hungarian sports are developing rapidly. Wang Chongjie (with picture)

    男女老少爱运动　国际比赛享盛名
    匈牙利已成体育强国
    匈牙利的体育运动享有非常高的国际声誉。十多年来人们把这个不到一千万人口的国家称为世界上的“体育强国”。的确，只要你翻阅一下国际比赛纪录就会发见：匈牙利选手几乎在所有的体育项目中都创造过优越的成绩，不论足球、篮球、乒乓球，还是击剑、体操、田径和游泳等，他们都是名列前茅，誉满世界。现在全国有六十多万个运动员，也就是说，全国居民平均每十六个人中就有一个水平挺好的运动员。从城市到乡村，从工厂到矿山，从机关到学校，男女老少都对体育运动具有浓厚的兴趣。
    最近二三年来，群众性的体育活动得到了进一步的开展，运动员们的技术水平也有了显著的提高。1959年匈牙利的运动员参加了十二种体育项目的世界锦标赛，共获得了三个冠军、十个亚军和七个第三名。他们在十一种体育项目的欧洲锦标赛中取得了十一个冠军和七个亚军。
    不论哪种体育项目在匈牙利都有广大的爱好者，其中最普及、最受广大群众欢迎的是足球。
    1953年匈牙利足球队在伦敦以六比三的成绩战胜了九十多年在自己球场上从来没有失败过的英国皇家足球队。接着1954年在布达佩斯匈牙利再度以七比一的绝对优势击败了英国皇家足球队。从那时候起，大英帝国再也不是吹嘘中的“足球王国”了。
    匈牙利的击剑运动在世界上久负盛名。历次重大国际比赛中，勇敢善战的匈牙利选手们一直是名列前茅，所以人们已习惯把匈牙利称为“善于击剑的民族”。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党去年7月公布了关于体育运动工作的政策纲领。纲领指出：社会主义体育运动的主要目的是用其特有的手段协助保卫和建设社会主义社会，帮助培养具有丰富知识、高尚道德、良好体质和热爱劳动的新人。今后要进一步广泛开展群众性的体育活动，使男女老少都能经常参加体育活动。
    在党和政府的正确领导和热心关怀下，匈牙利的体育运动事业正迅速向前发展。　　王崇杰（附图片）
