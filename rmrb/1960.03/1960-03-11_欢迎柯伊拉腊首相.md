    Welcome Prime Minister Koirala

    At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, Prime Minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala of the Kingdom of Nepal is coming to our country for a friendly visit and will arrive in Beijing today. Prime Minister Koirala brings the warm friendship of the Nepalese people from the southern foothills of the Himalayas. Our people extend a warm welcome to the distinguished Nepalese guest.

    The traditional friendship between China and Nepal can be traced back to ancient times. Even if we do not count the myths, stories, and legends widely circulated among the people of the two countries, there are already more than 1,500 years of written historical records. As early as the beginning of the fifth century AD, the eminent Chinese monk Fa Xian visited Nepal, braving dangers and traversing mountains and rivers. The eminent Nepalese monk Buddhabhadra also came to China in 406 AD. Nepalese artisans, known for their exquisite techniques, came to China and cooperated with their Chinese counterparts to build many magnificent temples and palaces. This traditional friendly relationship has enabled our two neighbors to live in harmony for a long time, leaving a profound impact on the social history of both countries. In the past century, due to the scourge of colonialism, the friendly exchanges between our two peoples have been hindered and damaged. However, after the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and Nepal's achievement of independence, especially after the official establishment of diplomatic relations in 1955, Sino-Nepalese relations have opened a new chapter based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    We are very pleased to see that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further developed on a new basis. Leaders of the two governments have paid friendly visits to each other. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, Vice Premier Ulanhu and others of our country have visited Nepal successively. Former Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya of Nepal, former Education and Health Minister Ba Sharma, and Rural Development Minister Tulsi Giri have also been our distinguished guests. In terms of economy and culture, friendly cooperation and exchanges have continued to expand. In September 1956, the governments of China and Nepal signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Traffic between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal"; in October of the same year, the China-Nepal Economic Aid Agreement was signed. The signing and implementation of these agreements have promoted friendship and understanding between the peoples of the two countries and provided good conditions for developing economic and cultural ties between each other.

    The Chinese government and people have always supported the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Kingdom of Nepal and are willing to see Nepal achieve new achievements on the road of independent development. If the people of China and Nepal established a traditional friendship in the distant past, then since the two countries became independent and free countries, the foundation of this friendship has become even more consolidated.

    In recent years, the governments of China and Nepal have developed good-neighborly relations between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The friendly relations between China and Nepal not only conform to the interests and aspirations of the two peoples, but also help maintain peace in Asia and the world. Because the two governments insist on consulting and handling all issues in their relations on the basis of the Five Principles, the prospects for friendly cooperation between our two countries are infinitely bright. We sincerely hope that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal can continue to develop; and be further strengthened through Prime Minister Koirala's visit to our country. May the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people be as eternal as the Himalayas connecting our two countries.

### 欢迎柯伊拉腊首相

    欢迎柯伊拉腊首相
    尼泊尔王国首相毕什韦什瓦·普拉萨德·柯伊拉腊应我国周恩来总理的邀请，前来我国进行友好的访问，将在今天到达北京。柯伊拉腊首相从喜马拉雅山南麓给我们带来了尼泊尔人民亲切的友谊，我国人民对尼泊尔贵宾的到来表示热烈的欢迎。
    中国和尼泊尔之间的传统友谊，可以追溯到遥远的古代。即使不算那些在两国人民中间广泛流传的神话、故事、传说，成文的历史记载也已经有一千五百多年。我国的高僧法显，远在纪元五世纪之初就曾不避艰险、跋山涉水访问了尼泊尔。尼泊尔的高僧佛驮跋陀罗也在公元四百零六年来过中国。以技术精巧著称于世的尼泊尔艺术匠人曾来中国，和中国的同行合作建造了许多巍峨宏伟的庙宇宫殿。这种传统的友好关系使我们两个邻居长期以来和睦共处，在两国社会历史上留下深刻的影响。近百年来，由于殖民主义的祸害，我们两国人民之间的友好往来受到阻碍和破坏。但是，在中国人民革命取得胜利和尼泊尔取得独立以后，特别是1955年正式建立外交关系以后，在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，中尼关系就展开了新的一页。
    我们十分欣慰地看到，自从中尼建交以来，我们两国的友好关系在新的基础上有了进一步的发展。两国政府的领导人互相进行了友好访问。我国周恩来总理、贺龙副总理、乌兰夫副总理等先后访问尼泊尔，尼泊尔前首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅、前教育和卫生大臣巴·夏尔马、乡村发展大臣图尔西·吉里也做过我们尊贵的客人。在经济和文化方面，友好的合作和交流不断扩大。1956年9月，中尼两国政府签订了“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”；同年10月，又签订了中国尼泊尔经济援助协定。这些协定的签订和实施，促进了两国人民间的友谊和谅解；为发展彼此间的经济和文化联系，提供了良好的条件。
    中国政府和人民一贯支持尼泊尔王国奉行的和平中立政策，愿意看到尼泊尔在独立发展的道路上取得新的成就。如果过去久远的年代里，中尼两国人民建立了传统的友谊，那么自从两国成为独立自由的国家以后，这种友谊的基础就更加巩固了。
    这些年来，中尼两国政府根据和平共处五项原则发展两国的睦邻关系。中尼两国之间的友好关系不仅符合两国人民的利益和愿望，而且有助于维护亚洲和世界和平。由于两国政府坚持在五项原则的基础上协商处理彼此关系中的一切问题，我们两国的友好合作的前景是无限光明的。我们衷心地希望，中尼两国的友好合作关系能够继续不断地发展下去；并且通过柯伊拉腊首相的这次访问我国，得到进一步的加强。愿中国和尼泊尔人民之间的传统友谊像联接我们两国的喜马拉雅山一样天长地久。
