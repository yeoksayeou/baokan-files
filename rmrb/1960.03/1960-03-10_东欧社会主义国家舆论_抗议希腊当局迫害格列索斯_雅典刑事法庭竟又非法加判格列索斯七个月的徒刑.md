Xinhua News Agency, March 6th—Public opinion in Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and other socialist countries in Eastern Europe strongly protests the persecution of Glezos and other democrats by the Greek authorities and demands their immediate release.

    The Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Glezos held a meeting in Prague. Participants condemned the illegal actions of the Greek judicial authorities in preparing to retry the Glezos "case" and demanded the immediate release of Glezos.

    Professor Iomascu, Chairman of the Romanian National Committee for the Defense of Glezos, published an article in "Spark" newspaper, stating that the trials of Glezos and other Greek patriots clearly expose the political purpose of the prosecution, which is to persecute the democratic forces in Greece and to attack the Greek people's struggle for peace and democracy. He concluded by saying that the Romanian public, along with the people of the world, demands that the Greek Supreme Court overturn the verdict made by the Athens Military Court.

    The Romanian Journalists Association sent a telegram to the Greek Supreme Court, strongly protesting the persecution of Glezos and expressing support for Kirkos, the president of "Dawn Daily," who was arrested for publishing Glezos's appeal.

    The Bulgarian Committee for the Defense of Glezos called on the Bulgarian public to further strengthen the struggle for Glezos's freedom.

    The Hungarian National Journalists Association also sent a telegram to the Greek authorities, strongly protesting the Athens government's illegal imprisonment of Glezos and other patriots.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 8th—According to TASS News Agency, Athens: The Athens Criminal Court added seven months to Glezos's sentence on the 7th because "Dawn Daily" published a letter of protest from Glezos. Kirkos, the president of "Dawn Daily," was also sentenced to five months in prison as a result, and "Dawn Daily" was deprived of the right to preferential access to newsprint for one month.

    This trial began on the 5th. The "crimes" added to Glezos and Kirkos were that Glezos's letter, published in "Dawn Daily" on February 28th, protesting the military court's verdict against him and other Greek democrats, "insulted the authorities and the judiciary." Yesterday's verdict by the Criminal Court not only increased Glezos's sentence but also created obstacles for Glezos in his struggle to overturn the military court's verdict against him and deprived Glezos of the right to criticize this verdict.

    During the trial, it became clear from the testimony of the plaintiffs' witnesses that this trial has special significance in the entire conspiracy to persecute Glezos. Deeply disturbed by the demands of people from all countries to overturn the shameful verdict of the military court, the Greek authorities are now attempting to prove the "legality" of the persecution of Glezos and the verdict against him before the Greek Supreme Court hears Glezos's appeal on the 12th.

    In court, Glezos rebuked the intention to punish him for writing a letter to the newspaper defending himself. He pointed out that the motive for his actions was not concern for himself but concern for the fate of democracy. Glezos once again emphasized that his persecution was politically motivated. He said that he would fight until justice is fully restored.

    Kirkos exposed the conspiracy of the authorities to portray the publication of Glezos's letter as a criminal act. He emphasized that the newspaper was only fulfilling its duty in defending Glezos. Glezos has already become famous throughout the world, and his name has become a symbol of the world's struggle for peace.

    Many figures from all walks of life with various political viewpoints appeared in court as Glezos's defense lawyers, such as former cabinet ministers Merkouris and Zakkas, parliamentarian Stefanakis, Athens Medical Association Chairman Floras, and Democratic Union leader Tsirimokos. This shows that people from all walks of life in Greece, regardless of their political beliefs, firmly demand the revocation of the shameful verdict against Glezos and other Greek patriots.

    东欧社会主义国家舆论
    抗议希腊当局迫害格列索斯
    雅典刑事法庭竟又非法加判格列索斯七个月的徒刑
    新华社6日讯　捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利等国社会舆论，坚决抗议希腊当局对格列索斯和其他民主人士的迫害，并要求立即释放他们。
    捷克斯洛伐克保卫格列索斯委员会在布拉格举行了会议。会议参加者谴责希腊司法当局筹备重新审理格列索斯“案件”的非法行动，并且要求立即释放格列索斯。
    罗马尼亚保卫格列索斯全国委员会主席约马斯库教授在“火花报”上发表文章说，对于格列索斯和希腊其它爱国人士的审讯，清楚地暴露出起诉的政治目的是迫害希腊的民主力量，打击希腊人民争取和平和民主的斗争。他最后说，罗马尼亚公众和世界人民一起，要求希腊最高法院撤回雅典军事法庭所作出的判决。
    罗马尼亚记者协会打电报给希腊最高法院，坚决抗议对格列索斯的迫害，并对由于发表格列索斯的呼吁书而被捕的“黎明日报”社社长基尔科斯表示声援。
    保加利亚保卫格列索斯委员会号召保加利亚公众进一步加强为格列索斯获得自由而斗争。
    匈牙利全国记者协会也打电报给希腊当局，坚决抗议雅典政府非法监禁格列索斯和其他爱国者。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：由于“黎明日报”发表了格列索斯一封抗议信，雅典刑事法庭7日加判格列索斯七个月的徒刑。“黎明日报”社长基尔科斯也因此被判处五个月徒刑，“黎明日报”被剥夺优惠取得白报纸的权利一个月。
    这个审讯是在5日开始的。加给格列索斯和基尔科斯的“罪名”是，“黎明日报”2月28日发表的格列索斯抗议军事法庭对他和其他希腊民主人士的判决的信“凌辱当局和司法”。刑事法庭昨天的判决不仅增加了格列索斯的刑期，而且使格列索斯在争取取消军事法庭对他的判决的斗争中遇到了障碍，还剥夺了格列索斯批评这一判决的权利。
    在审讯的过程中，人们从原告证人的证词中可以看出，在迫害格列索斯的整个阴谋中这次审讯具有特殊意义。对各国人民纷纷要求取消军事法庭的可耻判决深感不安的希腊当局，现在正企图在12日希腊最高法院审理格列索斯的上诉之前证明迫害格列索斯和对他作出的判决的“合法性”。
    格列索斯在法庭上斥责了这种因为他写给报纸一封为自己辩护的信就想惩罚他的打算。他指出，他的行动的动机不是由于关心自己，而是由于关心民主的命运。格列索斯再一次着重指出，对他的迫害是出于政治原因。他说，他将斗争到正义完全恢复为止。
    基尔科斯揭露了当局想把发表格列索斯的信这件事说成是犯罪行为的阴谋。他着重说，报纸保卫格列索斯只是履行自己的义务。格列索斯已经在全世界闻名，他的名字成了世界和平斗争的象征。
    出庭做格列索斯的辩护人的有具有各种政治观点的来自各阶层的许多人物，如前内阁大臣梅尔库里斯和扎卡斯、议员斯特凡尼基斯、雅典医生联合会主席弗洛拉斯、民主联盟领袖齐里莫科斯。这表明，政治信仰不同的希腊各界人士坚决要求撤销对格列索斯和希腊其他爱国者的可耻判决。
