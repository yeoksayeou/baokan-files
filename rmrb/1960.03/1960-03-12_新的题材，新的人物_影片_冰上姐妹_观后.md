New Subject Matter, New Characters
—— After Watching the Film "Ice Sisters"
    Yu Ce
    The color feature film "Ice Sisters" was one of the rich and diverse films presented for National Day last year, and it is also China's first feature film depicting ice sports.
    The film's director, using a light and cheerful style and beautiful images, against the backdrop of the Party leading sports work, launching mass sports activities, and vigorously cultivating sports talent, reflects a new generation with strong will and noble communist style on the ice rink and in sports training. Therefore, it has profound educational significance and an engaging power.
    One of the protagonists in the film, Ding Shuping, leaves the most profound and kindest impression. She is a female worker in a printing and dyeing factory, and also an amateur worker athlete who has grown up under the cultivation of the Party. The excellent qualities of this character in the film reflect the attitude of athletes in the new society towards sports, towards honor, as well as the noble style of helping each other, improving together, and creating new achievements.
    Although Ding Shuping defeated Wang Dongyan, who had won the championship for several years in a row, in the 3,000-meter speed skating competition, she was so humble. She integrated personal honor with the honor of the whole and worked hard to continue to create new achievements.
    The film also depicts her seeing Yu Liping and several classmates practicing stepping on the ice, and she takes the initiative to enthusiastically help them. This further reveals that Ding Shuping is not only striving to improve her skating skills and create new achievements, but also enthusiastically and patiently helping skating enthusiasts learn skills.
    However, another character in the film, Wang Dongyan, who has individualistic thoughts, is not like this. When Yu Liping asks her for skating guidance in person, she refuses with "I don't have time." In contrast, Ding Shuping's thoughts and actions are even more prominent.
    In the relationship between Ding Shuping and Wang Dongyan, the film vividly highlights Ding Shuping's new ideological qualities. After losing the championship, Wang Dongyan harbored jealousy towards Ding Shuping. Although Ding Shuping's attitude towards her was so sincere, Wang Dongyan responded to her with sarcasm. The most prominent example was during mountain climbing training, when Wang Dongyan left everyone and worked hard secretly, wanting to win back the honor of the championship, but unfortunately fell from a cliff. Ding Shuping immediately rushed to rescue her, regardless of everything. As a result, her own leg was broken, and she had to leave the ice rink temporarily. But she did not have the slightest regret or complaint, but instead endured all the pain in treatment with a tenacious will, in order to return to the ice rink as soon as possible. Her spirit of caring for comrades and selflessness educated Wang Dongyan, whose individualistic thinking was very stubborn, and she began to change her attitude.
    Another character in the film, Yu Liping, is an innocent, lovely, and sincere little girl who has established a deep friendship with Ding Shuping in sports training. She not only regards Ding Shuping as her teacher and friend, but even as her closest sister. In her mind, how can a student surpass a teacher in a competition, or a younger sister surpass an older sister? She is happier when her sister receives honor than when she receives honor herself. Therefore, in the national skating competition, when Ding Shuping and she were assigned to the same group, she requested to be transferred to another group. When her wish to be transferred was not fulfilled, she slowed down during the competition. She cannot jump out of her personal small circle to treat socialist sports competitions. Although she is well-intentioned, her actions can also be understood. At this time, Ding Shuping criticized her narrow personal feelings and explained to her that national honor is higher than personal friendship, and the sacred duty of athletes is to win glory for the country. With her help, Yu Liping truly understood the meaning of the competition.
    Through Ding Shuping's criticism and help to Yu Liping, it further shows that Ding Shuping has a correct understanding of the significance of sports and a tenacious will to exercise, so she can overcome difficulties, continuously progress, and achieve new results.
    Finally, in the 3,000-meter competition, when Ding Shuping learned that Yu Liping's weakness was that she could not maintain her speed in the last two laps, she accelerated in advance to stimulate her and help her achieve better results. Under her impetus, Yu Liping finally created a new achievement and broke the highest record. This incident is touching.
    The ice sisters, these vivid character images, are unforgettable for a long time, and are examples with a noble communist style that are worthy of everyone's learning. We hope that film studios will produce more good films with high educational significance.

    新的题材，新的人物
    ——影片“冰上姐妹”观后
    玉册
    彩色故事片“冰上姐妹”，是去年丰富多采的国庆献礼影片中的一部，也是我国第一部描写冰上运动的故事片。
    影片的导演，运用轻快明朗的手法和优美的画面，在党领导体育工作、展开全民性的体育活动和大力培养体育运动人材的背景上，反映了在冰场上、在体育锻炼中有坚强意志和高尚的共产主义风格的新的一代，因此，它具有深刻的教育意义和引人入胜的力量。
    影片中主人公之一的丁淑萍给人的印象最深刻，也最亲切。她是印染工厂的女工；也是在党的培养下成长起来的业余工人运动员。影片中这个人物的优秀品质，反映了新社会的运动员对待体育运动、对待荣誉的态度，以及相互帮助，共同提高，创造新的成绩的高尚风格。
    丁淑萍在三千米速滑比赛中，虽然战胜了连获数年冠军的王冬燕，夺得冠军，但她却是那样谦逊。她把个人的荣誉和整体的荣誉溶为一体，并为继续创造更新的成绩而努力。
    影片中还描写了她看见于丽萍和几个同学在冰上练习迈步，她便主动地、热情地去帮助她们。从这里更进一步揭示出丁淑萍不仅仅是努力提高自己的滑冰技术，创造新成绩，而且热情地、耐心地帮助滑冰爱好者学好技术。
    但是影片中另一个人物——有着个人主义思想的王冬燕却不是这样，当于丽萍当面请求她指导滑冰时，她却以“没有空啊”拒绝了。相形之下，丁淑萍的思想行动就更加突出了。
    在丁淑萍和王冬燕的关系上，影片鲜明地突出了丁淑萍的新的思想品质。王冬燕在失掉冠军之后，对丁淑萍便怀着妒恨，虽然丁淑萍对她的态度那样诚恳，但王冬燕回答她的却是讽刺。最突出的一次表现在爬山练习的时候，王冬燕离开大家，暗自下功夫，想把冠军的荣誉夺回来，但不幸从山崖上摔了下来，丁淑萍立刻不顾一切地去抢救她，结果自己的腿摔坏了，不得不暂时离开冰场。但是她并没有丝毫后悔和抱怨的情绪，而是以顽强的意志来忍受治疗中的一切痛苦，以便早日回到冰场上去。她的这种爱护同志、舍己为人的精神教育了个人主义思想很顽强的王冬燕，她开始转变了自己的态度。
    影片中的另一个人物于丽萍，是一个天真可爱、感情真挚的小姑娘，和丁淑萍在体育锻炼中建立了深厚的友谊。她不仅把丁淑萍当做自己的老师、朋友，甚至看作是最亲密的姐姐。在她的思想里，在比赛中学生哪能超过老师，妹妹哪能超过姐姐。姐姐得到荣誉，比她自己得到荣誉更要高兴。因此在全国滑冰运动比赛中，丁淑萍和她被分配在一个组里，她要求调组，调组的愿望没有能达到，她又在比赛中放慢速度。她不能跳出个人的小圈子来对待社会主义的体育竞赛。虽然她是出于善意的，她的这种行动也是能被人理解的。这时丁淑萍批评了她这种狭隘的个人感情，并向她说明国家的荣誉高于个人的友谊，运动员的神圣职责，是为国家争光。在她的帮助下，于丽萍真正理解了比赛的意义。
    通过丁淑萍对于丽萍的批评帮助，更进一步显示了丁淑萍对体育运动的意义有着正确的认识和顽强的锻炼意志，因此她能克服困难，不断地进步，获得新的成绩。
  最后在三千米比赛中，当丁淑萍了解到于丽萍的弱点是最后两圈不能坚持速度，她便提前加速去刺激她，帮助她达到较好的成绩。于丽萍在她的带动之下，终于创造了新的成绩，打破了最高纪录。这件事是令人感动的。
    冰上姐妹，这对生动的人物形象，使人久久难忘，是值得人人学习的具有高尚的共产主义风格的榜样。我们希望电影厂多拍制一些具有高度教育意义的好影片。
