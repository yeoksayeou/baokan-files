    Cuban Militiamen on the March
  　Liu Lanshan
    I walked out of the commune's candied fruit processing factory,
    迎面正吹着新春的风，
    The spring breeze was blowing in my face,
    Peach blossoms reddened the sky in the garden,
    The road was filled with the sound of leaping forward.
    Eating candied fruit,
    I saw you again—
    With machetes at your waists and rifles in your hands,
    Brave and bold Cuban militiamen!
    You were just in the sugarcane fields,
    Cutting sweet sugarcane and singing new songs;
    American planes darted in to drop bombs,
    The sugarcane fields were set ablaze by thieves!
    Extinguishing the fire with machetes,
    The anger in your hearts soared;
    Shouldering your rifles and stepping forward,
    The bugle call to defend Cuba resounded everywhere.
    When the American devils extend their sinister hands,
    Chop them off neatly with a swift blade!
    If the American wolves dare to invade,
    Gallows are waiting everywhere for them to hang!
    You are not just a militia,
    You are six million good guns and cannons;
    Beside you is all of Latin America,
    The Chinese people are with you day and night.
    Walking on the bright commune road,
    Spring plowing red flags rival colorful clouds,
    A team of Chinese militiamen are singing,
    Each voice congratulating our Cuban brothers.

    古巴民兵在行进
  　刘岚山
    我走出公社果脯加工厂，
    迎面正吹着新春的风，
    满园的桃花映红了天，
    一路上尽是跃进的歌声。
    吃着糖饯的果脯，
    我又望见了你们——
    腰插弯刀、手执钢枪、
    心高胆大的古巴民兵！
    你们刚才还在甘蔗田，
    割着甜甘蔗，唱着新歌谣；
    美国飞机窜来扔炸弹，
    甘蔗田被贼人放火烧！
    别起弯刀扑灭了火，
    心头的怒焰万丈高；
    扛起钢枪走上前，
    遍地吹起保卫古巴的军号。
    美国鬼一伸出阴谋的手，
    就用快刀把它齐斩掉！
    如果美国狼胆敢进犯，
    到处有绞架等它来上吊！
    你们不只是一支民兵队，
    你们是六百万杆好枪炮；
    在你们身边有整个拉丁美洲，
    中国人民日夜和你们在一道。
    走在明媚的公社大道上，
    春耕的红旗赛彩云，
    一队中国民兵在唱歌，
    声声祝贺着古巴亲弟兄。
