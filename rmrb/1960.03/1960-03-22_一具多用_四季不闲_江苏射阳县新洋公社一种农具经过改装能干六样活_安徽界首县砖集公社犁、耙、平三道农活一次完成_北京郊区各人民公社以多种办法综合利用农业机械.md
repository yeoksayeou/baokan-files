    Anhui's Jieshou County, Zhuanji Commune, completes plowing, harrowing, and leveling in one operation
    People's communes in the suburbs of Beijing comprehensively utilize agricultural machinery in various ways

    (Our report) The Xinyang People's Commune in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, is further innovating farm tools. One farm tool, after modification, can perform various farm tasks, achieving the effect of "one tool, multiple uses, busy all seasons." This can improve labor efficiency, shorten cultivation time, and save labor, money, and materials.

    The Party Committee of the Xinyang People's Commune in Sheyang County has always attached importance to the leadership of tool reform. From last autumn to now, the commune has modified and created 48 new types of farm tools. Among them, 15 are six-use tools, 20 are four-use tools, and 13 are three-use tools. For example, the three-toothed cultivator was originally only used for inter-row cultivation and weeding. Now, by simply replacing a few parts, it can perform six functions. By removing the hoe of the three-toothed cultivator, replacing it with two wooden boards, and installing a wooden hopper, it can be used for cotton sowing. After sowing, by re-installing a fertilizer box, it can be used for topdressing. In the summer, with slight modifications, it can be used for weeding and inter-row cultivation in cotton fields. In the autumn, it is modified into a three-wheat seeder. In winter, in addition to continuing to be used for topdressing, it can also be equipped with a four-toothed hoe for combing wheat.

    "One tool, multiple uses, busy all seasons" is a new development in the current farm tool reform movement. This has many advantages: First, it saves materials and labor. Taking the modification of the three-toothed cultivator into a cotton seeder as an example, a newly manufactured single-row seeder requires 5 jin of iron, 120 jin of wood, and 7 man-days. If the three-toothed cultivator is modified into a seeder, each unit only requires 4 jin of iron, 20 jin of wood, and 2 man-days. The commune has already modified 98 cotton seeders from three-toothed cultivators, saving a total of 98 jin of iron, 9,800 jin of wood, and 490 man-days. Commune members reflect, "One thing becomes multi-purpose, saving materials and labor." Second, the modification is simple and easy to use. After the farm tool factory produces the parts that need to be replaced, commune members can replace them themselves after simple learning. In the past, every time a new type of farm tool was created, commune members had to learn how to use it from scratch. Now, learning once allows them to use several tools. Third, one tool with multiple uses can sometimes complete several processes at once, greatly improving efficiency. At a time when spring plowing and field management of summer harvest crops are very tense, the creation of "one tool, multiple uses" is equivalent to increasing a large number of personnel.

    (Our Hefei report) The Zhuanji Commune in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, is greatly reforming farm tools in spring plowing, implementing "one tool, multiple uses," significantly improving labor efficiency and solving the difficulties of insufficient labor and tools. By the end of February, the commune had created and modified five types of tools, including triangular plows and harrows, amphibious harrowing and leveling devices, and seeding, fertilizing, and cultivating devices. These tools allow several processes in spring plowing to be completed at once, increasing efficiency by one to three times compared to old-fashioned farm tools. For example, the successfully trial-produced triangular plow and harrow is equipped with a triangular harrow and a flat plate behind a single-furrow plow. Drawn by two head of livestock and operated by one person, it can plow five mu of land a day to a depth of seven inches; plowing, harrowing, and leveling are completed in one operation, saving four head of livestock and two laborers compared to plowing, harrowing, and leveling done separately three times, and also increasing efficiency by more than three times. The amphibious harrowing and leveling device is a modification of the original fixed-tooth harrow, fitted with a roller cutter with bearings, a movable toothed harrow, and a flat plate. Because the bearings reduce resistance, it can harrow both dry land and paddy fields. Drawn by two head of livestock and operated by one person, it can harrow 15 mu of dry land or 9 mu of paddy field per day to a depth of six inches, harrowing and leveling at the same time, increasing efficiency by more than two times compared to the original. The seeding and fertilizing cultivator is made by modifying the original seeding drill into a double-hopper drill that can sow seeds and fertilize at the same time, and installing an automatic cultivator behind the drill leg. During sowing, it can apply fertilizer once more than the old-fashioned drill, and during topdressing, it can simultaneously loosen the soil and weed, increasing efficiency by more than one time compared to a single-use tool.

    Now, the commune's machinery factory and the production brigade's farm tool repair station have newly manufactured and modified more than 1,000 pieces of multi-purpose new farm tools, which have been promoted and used throughout the commune.

    (Our report) The people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are promoting the comprehensive utilization of agricultural power machinery to fully utilize the efficiency of the machinery. In Chaoyang District, there are more than 40 places that have implemented the comprehensive utilization of power machinery, driving more than 140 agricultural product processing tools, which can replace the labor of more than 4,000 laborers and more than 1,000 head of livestock.

    The comprehensive utilization of agricultural machinery greatly improves utilization efficiency. According to a survey by relevant departments in Beijing, the usage time of machinery used for drainage and irrigation can be increased by more than one and a half times. In the past, general drainage and irrigation machinery was only used for a few months a year, but after comprehensive utilization, it can be busy all year round.

    At present, the comprehensive utilization of agricultural machinery in the suburbs of Beijing generally includes the following methods:

    First, forming comprehensive processing plants centered on power machinery. The Shankou Village Livestock Farm in Miyun County uses a 10-horsepower portable steam engine to drive two millstones, one grinding stone, one pulverizer, one straw cutter, and a small generator. In addition to processing the entire farm's rations, feed, and night lighting, it can also process vermicelli and liquor, and grind flour for nearby production teams. Now, many communes and production brigades in the suburbs have established such comprehensive processing plants.

    Second, arranging multiple uses for drainage and irrigation machinery. The Wali Production Team of Yangzhen People's Commune in Shunyi County uses a 25-horsepower gas engine to pump water for irrigation when farmland needs water. When irrigation is not needed, it is used to drive threshers and rice hullers for the autumn harvest; in winter, it is used to drive mills to process grain and feed.

    Third, using small, light machinery to form mobile power machinery groups, which take turns going to various villages to carry out tasks such as straw cutting and threshing. This method is suitable for areas with few machines and dispersed residents.

    Adopting the above-mentioned comprehensive utilization methods requires little modification costs, and the mechanical parts that need to be added are not complicated. General county (district) industries and larger commune-run factories can manufacture and install them. (Attached picture)

    一具多用　四季不闲
    江苏射阳县新洋公社一种农具经过改装能干六样活
    安徽界首县砖集公社犁、耙、平三道农活一次完成
    北京郊区各人民公社以多种办法综合利用农业机械
    本报讯　江苏省射阳县新洋人民公社，进一步革新农具。一种农具经过改装，可作多种农活，收到了“一具多用，四季不闲”的效果，可以提高劳动效率，缩短耕作时间，既省工、省钱，又省材料。
    射阳县新洋人民公社的党委会，一向重视工具改革的领导。从去年秋后到现在，全社改制和创制了四十八种新式农具。其中，一具六用的有十五种，一具四用的有二十种，一具三用的有十三种。例如三齿耕耘锄，本来只用于中耕锄草，现在只要换几个零件，就可以做到六用。把三齿耘锄的锄头去掉，换上两块木板，再装上木斗子，就可以用于棉花播种。播种后，再改装上追肥箱，可以进行追肥。到了夏天，稍加改装，又可以给棉田锄草和中耕。秋天又改装成三麦播种机。冬季除继续用于追肥外，还可装上四齿锄进行梳麦。
    “一具多用，四季不闲”这是当前农具改革运动的一个新发展，这样做的好处很大：第一，省料省工。以三齿耘锄改装棉花播种机为例，新制一部单行播种机，需铁五斤，木材一百二十斤，七个人工。如以三齿耘锄改装播种机，每部只用铁四斤、木材二十斤，两个人工。公社目前将三齿耘锄已经改装好九十八部棉花播种机，共省铁九十八斤、木材九千八百斤、人工四百九十个。社员反映说：“一物变多用，省料又省工”。第二是改装简单，使用方便。农具厂把所需要调换的零件制成以后，经过简单学习，社员就能自行调换。过去每创造一种新式农具，社员在使用上都要摸一次生。现在学习一次就会使用几种工具。第三，一具多用，有时可把几道工序一次完成，大大提高了工效。在当前春耕生产和夏收作物田间管理十分紧张的时候，“一具多用”的创造，等于增加了大批有生力量。
    本报合肥讯　安徽省界首县砖集公社在春耕中大改农具，实行“一具多用”，显著提高了劳动效率，解决了劳力和工具不足的困难。全社到2月底已创制和改制了三角犁耙、水旱田两用耙平器、播种送肥中耕器等五种，这些工具使春耕中的几道工序一次完成，比旧式农具提高工效一至三倍以上。如试制成功的三角犁耙，是在单铧犁后面，装上三角耙和平板。用二头牲畜牵引，一人操作，一天可犁五亩地，深达七寸；随犁随耙随平，三道工序一次完成，比犁、耙、平分开三次进行节省四头牲畜和两个劳力，还提高工效三倍以上。水旱田两用耙、平器，是将原来固定的钉齿耙，改装上带轴承的滚刀、钉齿活动耙及平板。由于轴承减轻了阻力，能耙旱地，又能耙水田。两头牲畜牵引，一人操作，每天耙旱地达十五亩或水田九亩，深达六寸，随耙随平，比原来工效提高两倍以上。播种施肥中耕器，是利用原来的播种耧，改制成能播种同时又能施肥的双斗耧，并在耧腿后面安装自动中耕器。在播种时比旧式耧可多施一次肥，在追肥时可同时进行松土、锄草，工效比一具一用提高一倍以上。
    现在这个公社机械厂和生产大队的农具修配站，新制和改制了一具多用的新农具一千多件，并已在全社推广使用。

    本报讯　北京郊区人民公社正在推广农业动力机械的综合利用，充分发挥机械的利用效率。朝阳区有四十多处实行了动力机械的综合利用，带动一百四十多台农产品加工工具，可以代替四千多名劳力和一千多头牲畜的劳动。
    农业机械综合利用，使用效率大大提高，据北京市有关部门调查，用作排灌的机械，使用时间可以增加一倍半以上。过去一般排灌机械一年只用几个月，综合利用后可作到一年四季不闲。
    目前，北京郊区对农业机械的综合利用，较普遍的有以下几种作法：
    一、以动力机械为中心组成综合加工厂。密云县山口庄畜牧场，利用一台十马力锅驼机，带动两盘磨、一盘碾、一台粉碎机、一台铡草机和一座小型发电机，每天除加工全场口粮、饲料和夜间照明外，还可以加工粉丝、烧酒，为附近生产队磨面。现在郊区很多公社和生产大队都建立了这种综合加工厂。
    二、为排灌机械，安排多种用途。顺义县杨镇人民公社洼里生产队，用一台二十五马力煤气机，在农田需要用水时，就抽水浇地，不需要浇地时，就用以带动脱粒机、打稻机，进行秋收；冬天就用以带磨加工粮食和饲料。
    三、用小型、轻便机械，组成流动动力机械组，轮流到各村进行铡草、脱粒等项作业，这种办法适宜在机械少，居住分散的地区使用。
    采用以上几种综合利用的办法，所需改装费用不多，需要增加的机械零件也不复杂，一般县（区）工业和规模较大的社办工厂都可以制造和安装。（附图片）
