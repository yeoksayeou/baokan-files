Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 29th: The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee continued its routine meeting on the 28th.

It is reported that the Romanian representative, in his speech at the meeting, requested the representatives to move on to discussing concrete measures for a disarmament plan under effective international supervision. The Romanian representative said that this plan should obviously have the legal form of a comprehensive and thorough disarmament treaty.

The Italian representative, in his speech, defended the Western argument that a detailed supervisory system must first be drafted before discussing disarmament. He also suggested starting discussions on a draft agreement for such a supervisory system.

The U.S. representative, in his speech, quoted U.S. Secretary of State Herter's words at a press conference in Washington last week: the United States cannot accept a disarmament agreement that does not provide for important supervisory measures.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, pointed out that the U.S. representative did not answer specific questions, namely whether the U.S. is willing to start drafting a treaty that includes specific measures for disarmament and supervision, and whether it is willing to draft the basic terms of the treaty at the beginning. Zorin then said that the U.S. representative's speech increased doubts about the sincerity of the United States.

Zorin said that we advocate that a comprehensive and thorough disarmament treaty should include the necessary supervisory system. We are precisely suggesting to draft specific measures for disarmament and corresponding supervisory measures. However, does the U.S. delegation intend to discuss disarmament measures? Are they only going to discuss supervisory measures without disarmament measures? If the details of the supervisory system are discussed as suggested by Western countries, then the question arises: where are the disarmament measures? Zorin emphasized again that disarmament measures and supervisory measures for disarmament must be discussed.

Today's meeting shows that Western countries continue to evade concrete discussions on drafting a comprehensive and thorough disarmament treaty. (Attached picture)

### 西方国家在裁军会议上回避讨论裁军问题  苏联代表指出美国不谈裁军空谈监督

    西方国家在裁军会议上回避讨论裁军问题
    苏联代表指出美国不谈裁军空谈监督
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：十国裁军委员会28日继续举行例会。
    据悉，罗马尼亚代表在会上发言时，要求代表们转入讨论在有效的国际监督下的裁军方案的具体措施。罗马尼亚代表说，显然，这个方案应当具有全面彻底裁军条约的法律形式。
    意大利代表在发言时替西方这样的论点辩解：必须首先拟定详细的监督体系，然后才来谈裁军。他还建议着手讨论关于这样一个监督体系的协议的草案。
    美国代表在发言时引用了美国国务卿赫脱上星期在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上说的话：如果裁军协议不规定有关监督的重要措施，美国就不能接受这种协议。
    苏联代表团团长佐林指出，美国代表没有回答具体问题，即美国是否愿意着手拟定一项包括裁军和监督的具体措施的条约，是否愿意在开始时拟定条约的基本条款。佐林接着说，美国代表的发言增加了对美国的诚意的怀疑。
    佐林说，我们主张，全面彻底裁军条约应包括必要的监督体系。我们恰好是建议拟定裁军的具体措施和相应的监督措施的。但是，美国代表团是否有讨论裁军措施的打算呢？他们是否只是要讨论没有裁军措施的监督措施？如果像西方国家建议的那样讨论监督体系的细节，那么就会产生这样一个问题：裁军的措施在哪里？佐林再次着重指出，必须讨论裁军措施以及对裁军的监督措施。
    今天会议表明，西方国家继续回避具体讨论起草全面彻底裁军条约的问题。（附图片）
