Xinhua News Agency, 4th March: The Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) was held in Beijing from February 21st to 25th. The meeting called on workers across the country to hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, foster great ambitions, and vigorously carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, vigorously support the technological transformation of agriculture, and carry out cultural revolutions, in order to strive for a better leap forward in 1960.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the ACFTU, delivered a report at the beginning of the meeting. He analyzed the new situation of the current workers' mass movement and put forward the guiding principles and tasks of the trade union work in 1960.

The meeting discussed Liu Ningyi's report.

Nineteen executive committee members spoke at the meeting. They unanimously agreed with Liu Ningyi's report and reflected the situation since the Great Leap Forward, in which workers in various regions enthusiastically studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works and used the spirit of continuous revolution to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new climax.

Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union Federation, said that with the continuous improvement of the communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, their demand for theoretical study has become increasingly urgent. In 1959, 287,000 workers in Shanghai participated in the Red Flag reading campaign, which mainly involved studying Chairman Mao's works. They used theory as a weapon to solve many practical problems in ideology and production. After studying Chairman Mao's article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," workers at the Shanghai State-owned No. 9 Cotton Mill rapidly and universally spread advanced experiences throughout the factory. The workers praised: "Red Flag reading brings red thoughts, Chairman Mao's works are red for ten thousand years."

Hu Chuanjing, Chairman of the Harbin Municipal Trade Union Federation, said that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and automation in Harbin is being pushed to a new peak. As of February 15th, the city has already established 343 automated production lines, 80 mechanized workshops, retrofitted 31,000 old machine tools and old equipment, and achieved automation on 1,019 machine tools. Wang Qun, Vice Chairman of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel) Trade Union, said that Ansteel, due to further conducting technical performance competitions, in the first 14 days of February alone, workers put forward more than 194,000 innovation proposals, of which 40,362 have been implemented, which is equal to twice the total number implemented in January, thus solving many major key production problems.

Many executive committee members also pointed out in their speeches that with the arrival of one production and construction upsurge after another, a new situation of continuous rise has also emerged in the cultural revolution in various regions. In order to meet the urgent demand of the broad masses of workers to climb to new peaks in world science and culture, trade unions at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party, undertake the task of workers' spare-time education well. He Ying, Vice Chairman of the Changchun Municipal Trade Union Federation, said that after two years of the Great Leap Forward, Changchun's workers' education has entered a new stage of great development and great improvement. At present, the city has established 578 spare-time schools of various levels and types, with the number of enrolled students accounting for more than 66% of the number of people who should be studying. She said that in 1960, Changchun's workers' education requires resolutely eliminating illiteracy and establishing a complete workers' education system from primary school to university, mainly through spare-time education, so that all workers who should be studying are enrolled and fully promoted.

Liu Ningyi made a concluding speech at the end of the meeting. He said that China's socialist construction has entered a new stage of high-speed development. In order to adapt to the tasks assigned to the trade union by the Party in this new stage, trade unions at all levels must, under the absolute leadership of the Party, take the Party's central work as their own central work, and closely cooperate with women's federations, the Communist Youth League, and other units to jointly do a good job in educating, mobilizing, and organizing the masses. To this end, trade union organizations at all levels should organize cadres to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, continuously improve their ideological understanding and improve their work methods, and at the same time, go deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, be good at grasping typical examples, and summarize and promote advanced experiences. In this way, the work of the trade union will be both vigorous and solid, give full play to the role of the communist school, and become a strong assistant to the Party.

    全总执委会会议号召全国职工实现更好跃进
    更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗
    进一步大闹技术革命文化革命
    新华社4日讯　中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会第三次全体会议，2月21日到25日在北京举行。会议号召全国职工要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，树雄心、立大志，深入开展以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，大力支援农业技术改造，进行文化革命，为实现1960年更好的跃进而奋斗。
    全国总工会主席刘宁一在会议开始时作了报告。他分析了当前职工群众运动的新形势，并提出了1960年工会工作的方针和任务。
    会议就刘宁一的报告进行了讨论。
    有十九个执行委员在会议上发言。他们一致同意刘宁一的报告，并反映了大跃进以来，各地职工热烈学习毛泽东同志的著作，用不断革命精神，把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新高潮的情况。
    上海市总工会主席钟民说，随着广大职工共产主义觉悟的不断提高，他们学习理论的要求已愈来愈迫切。1959年上海市职工参加以学习毛主席著作为主要内容的红旗读书运动就有二十八万七千人。他们以理论为武器，解决了不少思想和生产中的实际问题。上海国棉九厂工人学习了毛主席的“星星之火、可以燎原”的文章后，使先进经验在全厂迅速普遍开花。工人歌颂道：“红旗读书思想红，毛主席著作万年红”。
    哈尔滨市总工会主席胡传经说，哈尔滨市以机械化、自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动正在推向新高峰。到2月15日，全市已经出现了三百四十三条自动化生产线，八十个机械化的车间，改装了三万一千台旧机床和旧设备，并在一千零一十九台车床上实现了自动化。鞍山市工会副主席王群说，鞍钢由于进一步开展了技术表演赛，仅2月前十四天内，职工们就提出了十九万四千多件革新建议，其中已经实现的有四万零三百六十二件，等于1月份实现总数的两倍，因而解决了很多重大的生产关键问题。
    许多执行委员在发言中还指出，随着生产建设高潮的一个接着一个到来，各地的文化革命也已经出现了持续上升的新局面。为了满足广大职工攀登世界科学文化的新高峰的迫切要求，各级工会必须在党的领导下，把职工业余教育工作很好地担当起来。长春市总工会副主席贺英说，经过两年大跃进，长春市的职工教育已经走向大发展、大提高的新阶段。目前，全市已办起各级各类业余学校五百七十八所，入学人数占应学习人数66％以上。她说，1960年长春市的职工教育要求做到坚决扫除文盲，以业余为主建立起从小学到大学的完整的职工教育体系，使应学习的职工全体入学、全部升级。
    会议最后由刘宁一作总结。他说，我国社会主义建设事业已经进入高速度发展的新阶段，为了适应这个新阶段中党所交给工会的工作任务，各级工会必须在党的绝对领导下，以党的中心工作为自己的中心工作，并和妇联、共青团等单位密切协作，共同做好教育、动员和组织群众的工作。为此，各级工会组织应组织干部认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，不断提高思想认识和改进工作方法，同时要深入基层、深入群众，善于抓住典型，总结和推广先进经验。这样，使工会工作既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，充分发挥共产主义学校的作用，成为党的有力助手。
