Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 28th. Cuban Prime Minister Castro said at a radio rally last night that anti-communism is a weapon used by foreign monopoly groups to carry out divisive activities in order to facilitate the invasion of Cuba. These foreign monopoly groups hope to restore the rule of large estates, free enterprise, and colonial dependency, which once seriously damaged Cuba.

While exposing the conspiracies of the divisionists, Castro emphasized that they use anti-communism as a guise because they dare not openly declare that they oppose the revolutionary laws that are warmly supported by the people. These conspiracies are financially subsidized by monopoly groups. They conspire to overthrow the government in order to extract the wealth of the people and not to collect from the large estates. They are trying to pave the way for a counter-revolutionary invasion plan aimed at restoring the violent and capitulationist regime that once ruled Cuba. He said that in the past, Cuba was forced to buy American rice and could not grow rice itself. Previous governments dared not touch the privileges of the monopoly groups because the American ambassador would subvert them. He asked, can this still be called a free and sovereign republic?

Castro said that the revolution has changed this situation and will make more reasonable changes. Large estates have been, or will soon be, completely owned by agricultural cooperatives. The goal remains to increase the country's productivity as quickly as possible.

Castro condemned the so-called free enterprise system, saying that domestic capital investments made without planning have caused great losses to the country. Before the revolution, the free enterprise system ruled Cuba for fifty-seven years and had proven that it could not solve the country's problems. In this regard, he pointed out the terrible poverty of the Cuban people in the past: 600,000 people were unemployed; farmers were starving and suffering from oppression. He said that at the same time, the rich were getting richer and richer. Castro said: This is the "free world" they are defending!

At the conference held by the National Federation of Sugar Workers, the National Federation of Sugar Workers handed over to Prime Minister Castro the decision of the sugar workers to freeze wages and agree to lower wages when needed by the national development plan. Castro emphasized that the sugar workers' decision to freeze wages shows their indestructible support for the revolutionary government. He said that it would be right for enterprises to make corresponding sacrifices, but this sacrifice is different from the voluntary sacrifice proposed by the workers themselves. As for the sugar owners, the government should force them to make sacrifices.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 28th. The Cuban government last night presented a protest note to the United States regarding the recent remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Herter attacking the Cuban government. The note has been delivered to U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Bonsal.

The note said that Herter had expressed some opinions, and since these opinions came from the highest person in charge of American foreign policy next to the president, they aroused serious concern from the Cuban government. The Cuban government has been accused with unfriendly words that do not conform to the actual situation of the Cuban people today.

In refuting Herter's statement that Cuba "is following communist methods," the note said that it seems that a warning should be issued, if no government and no organization prevented the cruel tyranny that killed 20,000 Cubans in the past, then now no government and no international organization has the moral and legal right to interfere and infringe on the political, economic, cultural and social sovereignty of the Cuban people.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter said in a television program in Washington on the 20th that "communist sympathizers hold senior positions" in the Cuban government, and that "Latin American countries are very concerned about this because they have treaties to deal with communist governments among them." On the 22nd, Herter also slandered Prime Minister Castro when speaking to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that "(he) has taken some dictatorial measures."

    卡斯特罗在糖业工人广播大会上发表演说
    谴责国内外敌人企图使暴政复辟
    古巴政府照会美国政府抗议赫脱对古巴革命的诬蔑
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗昨天晚上在一次广播大会上说，反共是外国垄断集团为便于侵略古巴而用来进行分裂活动的武器，这些外国垄断集团希望恢复曾经严重损害古巴的大庄园制、自由企业的统治地位和殖民地附属状态。
    卡斯特罗在揭露分裂主义分子的阴谋时强调指出，他们利用反共作幌子，因为他们不敢公开宣称他们反对得到人民热烈支持的革命法律。这些阴谋是得到垄断集团的财政津贴的。他们阴谋推翻政府，以便榨取人民的财富，而不要征收大庄园。他们企图为反革命入侵计划开辟道路，这个计划的目的是使过去统治着古巴的强暴的和投降主义的制度复辟。他说，过去古巴由于被迫购买美国稻米而自己不能种植稻米，历届政府都不敢碰一碰垄断集团的特权，因为美国大使会把它们颠覆掉。他问道，在这样的情况下难道还可以称为自由和主权的共和国吗？
    卡斯特罗说，革命改变了这种情况，并且还要做更多合理的变革。大庄园已经、或者即将完全归农业合作社所有。其目的仍然是最快地提高国家的生产力。
    卡斯特罗谴责了所谓自由企业制度，他说，没有计划地进行国内资本的投资已经使国家遭受很大的损失。革命前，自由企业制度在古巴统治了五十七年，已经表明它不能解决国家的问题。在这方面，他指出过去古巴人民的可怕的贫困：六十万人失业；农民忍饥挨饿，受尽压榨。他说，在这同时，富人却越来越发财致富。卡斯特罗说：这就是他们所保卫的“自由世界！”
    在这次糖业工人联合会召开的大会上，全国糖业工人联合会把糖业工人关于冻结工资以及在国家发展计划需要的时候同意降低工资的决定交给卡斯特罗总理。卡斯特罗强调指出，糖业工人作出的关于冻结工资的决定表明他们对革命政府的不可摧毁的支持。他说，各企业做出相应的牺牲将是正当的，但是这种牺牲与工人自己提出的自愿的牺牲不同。对糖业主来说，政府应该强使他们做出牺牲。
    据新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴政府昨晚就美国国务卿赫脱最近发表的攻击古巴政府的谈话向美国提出了一个抗议照会。这份照会已经交给美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔。
  照会说，赫脱发表了一些意见，由于这些意见出自仅次于总统的美国外交政策的最高负责人之口，因而引起了古巴政府的严重关切。古巴政府受到了不友好的和根本不符合古巴人民今天所处的实际情况的词句的指责。
    在驳斥赫脱说古巴“在遵循共产党的方法”时，照会说，似乎应该提出警告，如果说，过去没有任何一个政府和任何一个组织阻止过杀害两万古巴人的残酷的暴政的话，那末现在就没有任何一个政府、也没有任何一个国际组织有道义上和法律上的权力来进行干涉，来侵犯古巴人民政治、经济、文化和社会方面的主权。
    美国国务卿赫脱20日在华盛顿的一次电视节目中曾经说，古巴政府中“有共产党同情者担任高级职务”，“拉丁美洲国家都对此很关注，因为它们订有对付它们中间的共产党政府的条约。”赫脱22日在美国参议院外交委员会上谈到卡斯特罗总理时还曾诽谤说，“（他）采取了一些独裁手段”。
