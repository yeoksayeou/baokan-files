Party Secretary's Notes

In the Days of Developing Wanbao Mountain
Chang Dengbang, First Secretary of the CPC Minhou County Committee, Fujian

	It was past nine o'clock at night when I came out of the office of Comrade Ye Fei, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. I asked the driver to open the throttle, eager to drive back to the office immediately.

	Why was I so anxious? Because the general offensive on the 150,000 mu of Wanbao Mountain would begin tomorrow. Comrade Ye Fei was very concerned about this battle. He called me in the afternoon and gave important instructions: Developing Wanbao Mountain is a hundred-year plan for building socialism, a fundamental direction for revitalizing Fujian's economy, and a way to cultivate a new style and new work style for the entire party and all the people of our province. Therefore, this is a major battle, and we can only win, not lose. As soon as I returned to the office, I held a meeting of the Standing Committee, a meeting of the headquarters, and a telephone conference of the commune party committees, making the final deployment before the battle. By the time I left the office, it was already past two o'clock in the morning, and there were still four hours until dawn. It would be good to rest for a while, but as soon as I lay down, the "shasha" sound of footsteps on the road, the clanging of hoes, and the "honghong" sound of carts rang out in a chorus. This was the departure of the cadres from the Chenmen Commune and the county directly-affiliated organs. Immediately following this, the sound of loudspeakers from all directions also rang out. The clear singing tore through the silent night. In this atmosphere of high spirits, how could I sleep? Therefore, I got up before dawn and began the first day of work.

See Further Ahead
	The morning glow dyed the peaks of Wuhu Mountain a fiery red, and the gentle breeze rippled the surface of the Minjiang River. The car sped along the Fuzhou-Xiamen road, and the battle scenes of crowds of people on the surrounding mountain peaks constantly appeared before my eyes. Look! Isn't this Daoshi Mountain? Nearly 3,000 people are concentrated on this rocky mountain with an area of less than 200 mu. Isn't this Zhongshan, which was once known as "chilling and terrifying?" Today, the heroic warriors of the county directly-affiliated organs, the impassioned singing of battle songs, and the clanging of hoes shook the entire mountain. How could all this allow me to sit in the car in peace! If it weren't for rushing to Huangshan to welcome Comrade Ye Fei, I would have gotten out of the car and ran to the mountain to wield a silver hoe with everyone. Soon, Comrade Ye Fei arrived. As soon as he got out of the car, he shouted with a smile to go up the mountain. So, we went to the mountain of Lianban camp led by Huang Baoluo, a national model worker. As soon as we got to the mountain, we saw dozens of Young Pioneer members hoeing grass and moving stones. Secretary Ye happily touched the head of a Young Pioneer and asked, "Little Young Pioneer, what are you doing?" "We are creating our future happiness!" These words made the leaders laugh. When we reached the mountainside, it was just when the "May Fourth" Youth Assault Team and the "March 8th" Women's Assault Team were entering the decisive battle. Even though the leaders they knew well arrived, they didn't stop hoeing. The deputy battalion commander told the leaders that today these two teams would create a record of averaging 0.5 mu of land opened per person per day. The tense scene made people feel that they weren't tired when they came to the top of the mountain. The sound of gongs and drums came from afar. After a while, a team of old Huang Zhong's came, holding flags and carrying hoes on their shoulders. Pan Weizeng, who was over seventy years old, shook Secretary Ye's hand and said, "Secretary Ye, you judge, is it right for young people not to let us old people develop Wanbao Mountain? This is a great cause that benefits hundreds and thousands of descendants, how can we not participate!" Before he finished speaking, the others followed. It seemed that not agreeing wouldn't work. The leader smiled and satisfied their request, and they happily went down the mountain beating gongs and drums again.

	Comrade Ye Fei then said to us: "You see, developing Wanbao Mountain is considered to have captured the hearts of the masses. What should we do with these mountain lands that have been opened up? We must make plans early, you must see further ahead and make a comprehensive plan." Then he pointed to several mountain peaks and said that the most valuable economic forests could be planted here in pieces, and the citrus trees could be moved up below the mountainside to plant 10,000 mu of citrus. Intercropping with miscellaneous grains and feed can also be carried out under the trees, and pig farms can be built in the mountain depressions, raising one pig per mu of mountain land. In this way, it will be both a flower and fruit mountain, a livestock farm and a granary, which will truly become Wanbao Mountain.

	Our eyes have seen further, our minds have broadened, and our confidence is even greater.

Before the Martyrs' Tomb

	Early this morning, we crossed the Wulong River and came to Xiangqian Commune. In front of the tomb of Lin Xiangqian, the "February 7th" martyr, we stopped the car and once again paid our respects to the martyr's tomb, climbed Pillow Peak Mountain, and observed the mountain peaks surrounding the martyr's tomb. The county party committee has now made up its mind to beautify, embellish, and fruit these mountain peaks to comfort the spirit of the martyrs and enrich the hometown of the descendants of the martyrs. I thought to mobilize everyone, but it was not necessary. Look! The couplet written on the newly built arch on the mountain top: "We must use the spirit of Xiangqian's revolution in those years to develop today's Wanbao Mountain in the martyr's hometown," "Xiangqian's will changes nature, and the martyr's blood blooms red flowers." Doesn't this represent the determination and drive of more than 70,000 commune members in the hometown of Comrade Lin Xiangqian? It was under the impetus of this grand force that this commune opened 30,000 mu of barren mountains in just ten days.

"Poor Commune" on High Mountain

	The car arrived at Tingping Commune on Xuefeng Mountain, 1,600 meters above sea level. This is the highest mountain and the most remote and poorest commune in the county, but if you use this to measure that it is the most backward, then you are very wrong. Poverty requires change; poverty requires revolution. This is the basic force that has brought about earth-shaking changes in Tingping Commune this year. This commune has given full play to the great superiority of the people's commune, adopted a large-scale battle, and launched five battles and done five major things in less than four months from November last year to the present. They completely relied on their own efforts to build a large truck road of forty miles long, completed the three-fold improvement of 24,000 mu of indica paddy fields, accumulated 31 dan of refined fertilizer per mu of rice paddy fields, and afforested 250,000 mu in one fell swoop. Now they are reclaiming wasteland on 10,000 mu of mountain land. Look! Along both sides of the road, on the barren mountains, there are mountain buildings one after another, densely populated by crowds of people, scattered with red and green flags, and gongs and drums beating loudly, making even the land gods unable to sleep soundly. I ran up seven or eight high mountains in one breath without feeling tired. Seeing the terraced fields opened so well, with a width of more than one foot per row, Kunlun Mountain has a cart road, and the terraced fields have irrigation channels layer by layer. When I came to Jiaoyu Mountain, the weather suddenly changed. The thick fog covered the white Kunlun Mountain. Only when I walked up to it did I discover a commendable "Five Armies Competing for the Crown." It turned out that this battalion had more than 300 elderly, youth, middle-aged, teenagers, and women, and organized five assault teams to conduct a collective high-efficiency competition for a day today. In this weather where it was still cold to wear cotton clothes, the youths competed bare-chested, the middle-aged competed in shorts, the elderly competed without even smoking, the teenagers competed without saying a word, and the women competed forgetting to go home. In Sun Hongdi's home, the father, son, and grandson treated each other with respect, but today everyone cared about their own assault team, and no one would give way. They fought all day long. Chen Xuezai and his wife were not satisfied with participating in the collective competition, so the young couple started competing separately. It is with this iron will that they hoed mountains, and layers of terraced fields appeared before their eyes. There is really a sense of "heaven connecting the five ridges, silver hoes falling, the earth moving, three rivers, iron arms shaking." They wrote a poem "Ode to Wanbao Mountain" and sang:

Yesterday passed Xuefeng Mountain,
Xuefeng Mountain was a bald mountain,
Wild rabbits and pheasants are flying,
Wild boars and leopards are lurking in the mountains;
Today passed Xuefeng Mountain,
Xuefeng Mountain is full of people,
Labor songs resound through the sky,
Wielding hoes and axes to turn the mountain upside down;
Tomorrow passed Xuefeng Mountain,
Xuefeng Mountain turns into Wanbao Mountain,
Layers are covered with money trees,
From now on, paradise is moved to the world.

After seeing these scenes and hearing these odes, who can not be moved, who can not be proud, excited, and thrilled to have these heroes!

One Step Cannot Stop

	I ran around the county for a few days. Today I sat quietly in the headquarters and listened to a comprehensive report: 100,000 troops in the county have worked hard for five days and have opened up 200,000 mu of wasteland and afforested 80,000 mu, exceeding the task assigned by the prefecture committee by one time.

	In the evening, I announced on the phone that the Wanbao Mountain development campaign would end ahead of schedule.

	But, early in the morning, the phone on my desk kept ringing. This commune asked to extend it for two more days, and that commune said that the commune members would not go down the mountain and would definitely want to do it again. I had to make a half-mobilization and half-forced order for them to go down the mountain and rest for two days. The commune members have rested, but how can we rest? The office is busy writing a summary report on the development of Wanbao Mountain, and the secretariat is studying the next work deployment centered on drought resistance and spring plowing. We must keep moving forward, we cannot stop for a step, we cannot waste a moment!

### 在开发万宝山的日子里
常登榜

专栏：党委书记手记

    在开发万宝山的日子里
    中共福建闽侯县委第一书记　常登榜
    从省委第一书记叶飞同志的办公室里出来，已经黑夜九点多钟了，我要求司机开大汽门，恨不得一开车就回到机关。
    我为什么这样焦急呢？因为明天就开始对十五万亩万宝山的总攻势。叶飞同志很关心这次战斗，下午把我叫去，作了重要指示：开发万宝山，这是建设社会主义的百年大计，是繁荣福建经济的根本方向，是培养我省全党全民的新风格新作风，所以这是一场大战斗，只许打好，不许打败。我一回到机关就接连开了常委会、指挥部会、公社党委电话会，作了战前的最后一次部署。等我走出办公室，已经是深夜二时多了，离天亮还得四个钟头，还是休息一会儿好，但刚躺下去，公路上脚步的“沙沙”声，锄头的叮当声，板车的“哄哄”声响成一片，这是城门公社和县直属机关干部的队伍出发了，紧随着四面八方的喇叭声也响了。嘹亮的歌声撕破了沉默的黑夜，在这群情高昂的情况下，我怎么能睡下去呢？因而天没亮就起床，开始了战斗的第一天工作。
    要看得远些
    朝霞照得五虎山头丹丹红，和风吹得闽江水面微波开，汽车在福厦路上疾驰着，周围山头上人山人海的战斗局面不断地出现在眼前。看！这不是刀石山吗？这块方圆不到二百亩地的石头山上，差不多就集中了三千多人；这不是过去被称为“寒风凛凛毛骨悚”的钟山吗？今天，县直属机关的勇士们，激昂的战歌声，叮当的锄头声震撼了整个山头。这一切，怎能使我安坐车子呢！不是为了赶到黄山迎接叶飞同志，我早就下车跑到山上与大伙一块儿挥着银锄。不久，叶飞同志来到了，他一下车就满面笑容嚷着上山，于是，我们一道来到全国劳动模范黄宝洛领导的连坂营的山头，才上山就看到几十个红领巾队员们在锄草搬石头，叶书记高兴地摸着一位少先队员的头问道：“红领巾小朋友，你们做什么呀？”“我们在创造自己未来的幸福！”这话说得首长们大笑起来。到了山腰，刚好正是“五四”青年突击队和“三八”妇女突击队进入决战的时候，虽然他们所熟识的首长到来，也一锄不停，副营长告诉首长说，今天这两个队要创造平均每人日开五分地的纪录。紧张的场面，使人不觉得累就来到山顶，远远送来锣鼓声，一会儿一队手拿着旗子、肩抬着锄头的老黄忠们来了。领头的七十多岁的潘为增握着叶书记的手说：“叶书记你评评理，年青人不让我们老头开发万宝山，对不对？这是造福百子千孙的大业，我们哪能不参加！”他还没说完，其他的人也跟上了。看来不答应也是不行的，首长含笑满足了他们的要求，他们才又高高兴兴地打着锣鼓下去了。
    叶飞同志接着对我们说：“你们看，开发万宝山，算是抓住了群众的心了，开了这些山地怎么办呢？要早作个打算，你们眼睛要看得远一些，作个全面的规划。”接着他就指着几个山头说，这里都可以成片种上最有价值的经济林，山腰以下可以把柑桔树搬上来，种他一万亩柑桔，树下还可以套种上杂粮、饲料，山窝建上猪场，每亩山场养上一头猪。这样，既是花果山、畜牧场又是个粮仓，那才真正成了万宝山。
    我们的眼睛看远了，胸怀宽大了，信心更足了。
    烈士墓前
    今天一早，就渡过乌龙江来到祥谦公社，在“二七”烈士林祥谦的墓前，我们停下车子，再一次祭扫了烈士墓，登上了枕峰山，观察了烈士墓周围的山头。县委这次下定决心，香化，美化，果化这些山头，以慰烈士英灵，以富烈士后代的家乡。我心想对大家作个动员，但用不着了。看！那山头上刚搭的彩门写的那两副对联：“要以当年祥谦闹革命意志，开发今天烈士家乡万宝山”，“祥谦意志改自然，烈士鲜血开红花”。这不代表了林祥谦同志家乡七万多个社员的决心和干劲了吗？就是在这股宏大的力量的推动下，这个社在短短十天中就开了三万亩的荒山。
    高山“穷社”
    车子到了海拔一千六百米的雪峰山上，我们来到了廷坪公社。这是全县最高的山和最偏僻最贫穷的公社，但你要以此就衡量它最落后，那就大错特错。穷就要变；穷就要革命。这是廷坪公社今年起着翻天复地变化的基本力量。这个社发挥人民公社巨大优越性，采取了大兵团作战，从去年11月到现在不到四个月时间内，就打了五次战役，干了五桩大事。他们完全自力更生修了一条长达四十华里的大卡车路，完成了二万四千亩籼田的三改，每亩山田积了精肥三十一担，一举造林二十五万亩，现在又在一万亩山场上开荒。看！沿公路两侧一重又一重的荒山上，搭着一座又一座的山楼，住扎着密密麻麻的人群，遍插着红红绿绿的小旗，打着咚咚??的锣鼓，闹得连土地公也不能安枕。我一口气跑了七八座高山也不感到累，看到梯田开得这么好，丘丘一尺多，昆昆山上有板车路，层层梯田有排灌道。当我来到焦渔山头，天气突然起了变化，浓雾盖得昆昆山头白茫茫，一直走到面前，才发现这里出现一场可歌可颂的“五军夺魁”，原来这个营有三百多位的老年、青年、壮年、少年、妇女，组织了五个突击队，今天进行了一天的集体高工效竞赛。在这穿棉衣还感到冷的天气里，青年赛得赤着上身，中年赛得只穿短裤，老人赛得连烟都不吸，少年赛得一话不讲，妇女赛得忘记回家。孙洪弟老汉在家里，父子孙相敬如宾，但今天谁都关心自己的突击队，谁也不让一步，谁也不服输，一直战了一天。陈学宅夫妇参加集体赛还不过瘾，小两口单独的赛起来。他们就是以这股钢铁的劲头，山锄到处，一层层梯田出现在眼前，真有“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇”的气概。他们编了一首“赞万宝山”诗歌唱道：
    昨天路过雪峰山，
    雪峰山是光秃山，
    野兔山鸡在飞跳，
    山猪虎豹伏山间；
    今天路过雪峰山，
    雪峰山上人满山，
    劳动歌声冲天响，
    挥锄动斧闹山翻；
    明天路过雪峰山，
    雪峰山变万宝山，
    层层长满摇钱树，
    从此天堂搬人间。
    看了这些场面，听了这些颂歌，谁能不受感动，谁能不为有这些英雄而感到自豪、兴奋和激动！
    一步不能停
    全县跑了几天，今天静坐指挥部听了全面的汇报：全县十万大军，苦战五天，已开荒二十万亩，造林八万亩，超过地委分配任务的一倍。
    晚上，我在电话上宣布，开发万宝山战役提前结束。
    但，一清早我桌子上的电话一直在响，这个社要求延长再干两天，那个社说社员不下山，一定还要再干。我只得来个半动员半强迫，命令他们下山休息两天。社员算是休息了，但我们这些人怎能休息呢？办公室忙于写开发万宝山总结报告，书记处正在研究下一步以抗旱春耕为中心的工作部署。前进一直要前进，一步不能停，一时不能空过！
