    Socialist Camp Strongly Supports
    Cuban Sugar Finds New Sales Channels
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 17th. Cuban Trade Minister Bonilla said on the evening of March 16th that Cuba has sold 2,074,000 tons of sugar out of the 2,195,000 tons quota set for Cuba by the London International Sugar Council, meaning that Cuba has sold 97% of its quota on the world market.
    The minister pointed out that Cuba's fixed trade with the Soviet Union guarantees the sale of 3 million tons of Cuban sugar on the world market this year. He also said that Cuba had sold 50,000 tons to Poland and 100,000 tons to the United Kingdom on the 16th. He said that the needs of Cuba's traditional market of 800,000 tons have not yet been met, and he pointed out that Japan, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and Morocco have not yet purchased 20% of their average annual sugar quota from Cuba. In addition, there is a need for 300,000 tons from non-traditional buyers.
    The Cuban newspaper "World News" commented today that this result is a victory for Cuba and also proves once again the correctness of Cuba's economic line in foreign markets. (Attached picture)

    社会主义阵营大力支持
    古巴糖有了新销路
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴贸易部长博尼利亚16日晚上说，古巴已经卖出了伦敦国际糖业理事会为古巴规定的二百一十九万五千吨中的二百零七万四千吨糖，也就是说，古巴已卖出了它在世界市场上的定额的97％。
    这位部长指出：古巴同苏联的固定交易保证了今年古巴糖在世界市场上卖出三百万吨。他还说，古巴在16日已卖给波兰五万吨，卖给英国十万吨。他说，古巴传统市场八十万吨的需要尚未满足，他指出日本、英国、西德和摩洛哥都还没有购足它们每年平均向古巴购买食糖定额的20％。此外，还有非传统买主的三十万吨的需要。
    古巴“世界报”今天在评论中指出，这个结果是古巴的胜利，同时也再次证明了古巴在外国市场上的经济路线的正确。（附图片）
