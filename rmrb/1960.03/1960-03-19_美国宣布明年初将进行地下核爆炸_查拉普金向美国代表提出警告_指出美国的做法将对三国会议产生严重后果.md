Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 17th. Soviet representative Tsarapkin, addressing the U.S. delegation at the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests on the 17th, issued a warning regarding the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's statement yesterday, saying that the U.S.'s resumption of nuclear testing may have serious consequences for the Soviet, American, and British discussions on discontinuing nuclear weapon tests.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's statement said that the U.S. will conduct an underground nuclear explosion in New Mexico next January.

According to Western newspapers, preparations such as digging tunnels have already begun. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission originally planned to announce this test on March 3rd, but postponed it to the 16th to await U.S. President Eisenhower's return from his visit to South America for approval.

At the meeting, Tsarapkin asked U.S. representative Wadsworth to clarify the purpose of the U.S.'s nuclear explosion.

According to attendees, Wadsworth read a statement about the "peaceful purpose" of the explosion. However, recent reports in Western newspapers have long revealed the U.S.'s eagerness to resume nuclear testing. These reports have repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. Pentagon and Atomic Energy Commission strongly advocate resuming testing to improve U.S. nuclear weapons.

The tripartite conference on discontinuing nuclear weapon tests began work in October 1958. For more than a year, the conference has reached agreements on the preamble and seventeen clauses of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear tests and the establishment of an international supervision system. However, because the United States insists on having the freedom to conduct underground nuclear tests and refuses to stop all nuclear weapon tests, the work of the conference has been stalled for a long time.

### 美国宣布明年初将进行地下核爆炸  查拉普金向美国代表提出警告  指出美国的做法将对三国会议产生严重后果

    美国宣布明年初将进行地下核爆炸
    查拉普金向美国代表提出警告
    指出美国的做法将对三国会议产生严重后果
    新华社日内瓦17日电　苏联代表查拉普金17日在日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议上针对美国原子能委员会昨天发表的一项声明向美国代表团提出警告说：美国恢复核试验的做法对于苏、美、英三国讨论不继续核武器试验的会议可能产生严重的后果。
    美国原子能委员会的声明说，明年1月美国将在新墨西哥进行一次地下核爆炸。
    据西方报纸说，如挖掘地洞等准备工作已经开始。美国原子能委员会原定3月3日宣布这次试验，所以推迟到16日是因为等待美国总统艾森豪威尔访问南美归来后加以批准。
    查拉普金在会上要求美国代表华兹沃斯澄清美国进行核爆炸的目的。
    据与会人士说，华兹沃斯宣读了一项关于这次爆炸的“和平目的”的声明。但是西方报纸最近刊载的消息早就透露美国急于恢复核试验的目的。这些消息曾经一再指出，美国五角大楼和原子能委员会强烈主张恢复试验以改进美国的核武器。
    三国不继续核武器试验会议在1958年10月开始工作，一年多以来，会议已经就禁止核试验和建立国际监督制度条约的序言和十七条条款达成了协议。可是由于美国坚持要有进行地下核试验的自由，不愿停止一切核武器试验，从而使会议的工作长期停滞不前。
