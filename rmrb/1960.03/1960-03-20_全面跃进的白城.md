    The Overall Leap Forward in Baicheng
    Zhao Ziping, First Secretary of the Baicheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Baicheng Prefecture is located in the northwestern part of Jilin Province. It adjoins the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to the west and borders Heilongjiang Province to the north. It is a vast, flat grassland of more than four million hectares between the Changbai Mountains and the Greater Khingan Mountains. More than two million hard-working people of all ethnic groups live here. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Provincial Party Committee, they are full of energy and have stepped into a new stage of socialist construction. Here, it is now bathed in spring sunshine, with a strong east wind, and the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are flying high. The miracles created by the people are everywhere.
    "Eight hundred miles of arid sea turned into an oasis, a disastrous grassland turned into a paradise." This widely circulated ode succinctly describes the changes in this region. In the past, people said that this was the famous eight hundred miles of arid sea, a place of suffering and poverty. The main disasters in the eight hundred miles of arid sea were wind, sand, and drought. The masses said, "When summer begins, goose feathers stop, and stone rollers are blown up into the trees." Indeed, when a strong wind blew, dust and sand flew, blocking out the sky and the sun. The sown crops were blown away, and the crops that were about to mature were also blown down. The wind blew away the peasants' hard work for a year and their livelihood for a year. Drought was also very serious. The masses said, "The old arid sea is very bitter, with drought in nine out of ten years." In places along the river, floods were also a serious threat to the people. Once a flood occurred, it was a vast expanse of water. In addition, epidemics in the past were also very rampant. Plague and typhoid fever occurred frequently. There were no doctors and no medicines. When the masses got sick, they had to pray to gods and ghosts and wait to die.
    Disasters and epidemics were all caused by the system of the old society. At that time, feudal landlords, warlords, bandits, Japanese imperialism and its lackeys colluded with each other. The more serious the disasters and the more painful the people were, the more these fierce jackals and insatiable bloodsuckers plundered, exploited, and oppressed.
    After liberation, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao sent cadres. The people of the eight hundred miles of arid sea saw the sun and embarked on a happy road of continuous progress. In the past few years, after various democratic reform movements, especially since 1958, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have not only eliminated the threat of wind, sand, and drought and sent away the god of plague in the eight hundred miles of arid sea, but also ushered in a continuous Great Leap Forward. Baicheng Prefecture, like other regions in the country, has been able to make continuous Great Leaps Forward because it has listened to Chairman Mao's words, followed the Communist Party, and followed the mass line. The facts since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have proved that the poorer and more difficult the place was in the past, the more energetic the people there are, the more they create, the greater the achievements, and the faster the pace of the leap forward.
    Take industry as an example. During the period of warlord rule and Japanese puppet rule, national industries were severely plundered and squeezed. In the early days of liberation, industry was so dilapidated that there was almost nothing left. Therefore, in Jilin Province, the industrial base of Baicheng Prefecture was very poor and relatively backward. It has developed rapidly since liberation. Compared with the early days of liberation, it is really a world of difference. In 1949, the total industrial output value of the entire region was only more than 18 million yuan. In 1957, it developed to 81.742 million yuan. In 1958, it developed to 129.88 million yuan. In 1959, it had developed to more than 168.86 million yuan. This year, it is planned to develop to more than 200 million yuan, which is more than ten times higher than eleven years ago. The industrial development in the Baicheng area has been very rapid, with high output, many varieties, and good quality. It has ended the history of not producing iron and steel. Coal production has a certain foundation, oil production has great prospects, and the machinery industry is also advancing. The production of light industries such as paper making, sacks, caustic soda, wool spinning, pulp, canned food, milk powder, sugar, and grain and rice processing are like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The industries run by the People's Communes are also blooming everywhere, colorful and vibrant.
    After 1954, especially after the establishment of the People's Communes, agricultural production has leaped forward even more rapidly. The eight hundred miles of arid sea, which had always been plagued by disasters, has achieved bumper harvests year after year. Since 1954, the Baicheng area has ended the situation of the state transferring grain every year. Before 1945, no matter how many people starved to death from famine or drought, no one cared, so naturally not much grain would be transferred in. After liberation, from 1949 to 1953, the state transferred a total of 182,731 tons of grain to the eight hundred miles of arid sea, an average of more than 36,500 tons of grain per year. In addition, the state allocated a total of 529,000 yuan in relief funds during these five years. It can be seen from this that the care and support of the Party and the government are an important guarantee for the people of the eight hundred miles of arid sea to embark on a happy life. This is the unparalleled superiority of our social system.
    The People's Communes are incomparably superior, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is blooming everywhere, deep autumn plowing has a very good effect, and great achievements have also been made in water conservancy work. More importantly, wheat fields can be replanted with buckwheat, Chinese cabbage, millet, and carrots, and the yields are very high, breaking the conservative idea that replanting is not possible in the eight hundred miles of arid sea, thus adding new content to multiple cropping and high-yield cultivation in the Baicheng area, and tapping greater potential for increasing production. These facts prove that as long as the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is conscientiously implemented and agricultural modernization is further realized, the development prospects for agriculture will be even greater. Now we have changed from a region that needed the state to transfer grain and invest large amounts of relief funds every year to a region that is self-sufficient in grain and delivers large amounts of public grain and purchased grain, from a region where each person had very little grain to a region where each person has a relatively high amount of grain. This change is a victory for the Party's leadership, a victory for the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and a victory for the People's Communes. In 1959, according to the rural population, our entire region had an average of more than 1,700 catties of grain per person. Because the potential for increasing agricultural production is still very large and there are many favorable conditions, the task of 1,700,070 tons of grain in 1960 is guaranteed. At that time, the rural population will have an average of 2,000 catties of grain.
    In terms of animal husbandry, the Baicheng area has vast grasslands, the masses have the habit of engaging in animal husbandry production, and there is a certain foundation. Before liberation, there were only 200,000 head of large livestock. In 1949, there were only more than 240,000 head of large livestock, 38,000 pigs, and 60,000 sheep. By the end of 1959, the number of pigs in stock had reached 477,785, a net increase of 40.06% compared with the end of 1958. The number of large livestock has increased to 600,453 head, a net increase of 9.8%; the number of sheep has reached 393,251, a net increase of 39%; other poultry, rabbits, bees, and the breeding of wild animals have also seen new developments. Now, there have been many miracles of horses producing twins, cows producing twin calves, sheep producing five lambs, and sows producing hundreds of offspring in a year. We must conscientiously follow the Party's policy on developing animal husbandry, take pigs as the head of the six domestic animals, and raising pigs as the center of the animal husbandry industry, and elevate the typical experience of a sow producing hundreds of offspring a year to a mass movement of a hundred sows producing ten thousand offspring a year. This year, we will strive to complete the glorious task of having two million pigs in the entire region. This year, it is planned to develop large livestock to more than 650,000 head, a net increase of 8.3% per year, and we must grasp the work of full allocation, full accuracy, full birth, and full strength. This year, it is planned to develop sheep to 487,500, a net increase of 24%, and we must carry out the movement of a hundred mothers and a hundred offspring, a thousand mothers and a thousand offspring, and ten thousand mothers and ten thousand offspring. In animal husbandry, we should pay attention to both quality and quantity in the future, and use livestock, meat, wool, milk, hides, and manure in multiple ways, and grasp water, fodder, seeds, breeding, management, prevention, and engineering. The animal husbandry in the Baicheng area has great potential and great development prospects.
    In terms of forestry, this place was barren mountains and ridges and a barren grassland before liberation. After liberation, forestry has also developed rapidly. Now there are more than 400,000 hectares of forest land. In particular, the more than 30,000 hectares of trees planted with tractors have grown into timber about three meters high, forming a criss-crossing forest network and forest sea, which plays a role in preventing wind and fixing sand and regulating the climate. Of the more than 2,000 hectares of fruit trees, 20% have blossomed and borne fruit. People sent the first and best fruits they grew to Beijing to dedicate to Chairman Mao. Apricots, peaches, plums, apples, hawthorns, crabapples, strawberries, grapes, etc., are everywhere in the eight hundred miles of arid sea. This year, we are also preparing to plant 92,000 hectares of windbreak trees and 2,800 hectares of fruits and grapes. We will strive to have one grape tree per person in the entire region in two or three years, and ten grape trees per person in three or four years, so that people can eat more fruits they grow themselves and drink the wine and fruit dew they make themselves. Now the people of the entire region are greening, scenting, coloring, sweetening, and beautifying their socialist happy home with soaring energy.
    The incomparable superiority and vigorous vitality of the People's Communes have made production in the Baicheng area rise year after year, people's income increase year after year, and people's lives become more prosperous and fulfilling year after year. Now the people eat not only enough grain, but also more than 10% of the fine grains they grow themselves. In 1959, because the People's Communes were strong, the Baicheng area planted more than 84,000 hectares of wheat and obtained a bumper harvest, removing the label of low wheat yield, and also handed over nearly 30,000 tons of wheat for public purchase. The People's Communes enable people to eat white flour dumplings and white and fragrant rice made from the grain they grow themselves. With the development of production and the improvement of living standards, eating has changed from coarse to fine. The clothes and houses that people wear and live in are also much better than before. Members of the People's Communes generally have savings in the credit cooperatives. Since liberation, the broad masses of working people in this region have made great progress in political thought, moral character, socialist awareness, and communist style. These priceless treasures are more precious than steel, coal, machinery, grain, livestock, and scientific and cultural achievements.
    We will resolutely listen to the words of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and strive forward in the direction indicated by the higher-level Party committees. We will resolutely strengthen the Party's leadership, rely on the masses, break superstitions, emancipate our minds, and hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, so that the industrial production, agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production, and other work in the Baicheng area can continue to leap forward.

    全面跃进的白城
    中共白城地委第一书记　赵子平
    白城专区，位于吉林省西北部。它西接内蒙古自治区，北靠黑龙江省，是长白山和大兴安岭两山脉之间四百多万公顷的一片广阔平坦的大草原。这里生活着二百多万勤劳勇敢的各族人民。他们在党中央、毛主席和省委领导下，干劲十足，大步跨进了社会主义建设的新阶段。这里现在是春阳普照，东风劲吹，总路线的红旗、大跃进的红旗、人民公社的红旗高高飘扬。人民创造的奇迹遍地皆是。
    八百里旱海变绿洲，灾难的草原成乐园。这句广为流传的颂歌，概括地道出了这个地区的变化。过去，人们传说这里是有名的八百里旱海，是个苦难和穷困的地方。八百里旱海的主要灾害是风沙干旱，群众说“立夏鹅毛住，石头磙子刮上树。”的确，大风一起，尘沙飞扬，遮天蔽日，种的庄稼籽粒刮净了，即将成熟的庄稼也被刮倒。大风刮走了农民一年的辛苦，刮走了农民一年的生活。旱灾也很严重。群众说：“老旱海多苦，十年倒有九年旱”。在临江沿河的地方，水灾也是人民群众严重的威胁，一遇洪水就是一片汪洋。另外，过去的疫病也是很猖獗的，鼠疫、伤寒经常发生，没有医生，没有药物，群众得了病只好求神拜鬼等着死。
    灾害和疫病，都是旧社会的制度所造成的。当时，封建地主、军阀、盗匪、日本帝国主义和它的爪牙们，互相勾结在一起，越是灾荒严重的时候，越是人民痛苦的时候，这些凶恶的豺狼和贪得无厌的吸血鬼，越是掠夺、剥削、压榨。
    解放后，党中央、毛主席派来了干部。八百里旱海上的人民看到了太阳，走上了步步登高的幸福路程。几年来，经过了各项民主改革运动，特别是1958年以来，总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动，使八百里旱海上，不仅消除了风沙干旱灾害的威胁和送走了瘟神，而且出现了连续的大跃进。白城专区和全国其他地区一样，所以能够连续大跃进，这是因为听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走，走群众路线的结果。1958年大跃进以来的事实证明，过去越是穷困苦难的地方，那里的人民干劲越足，创造越多，成就越大，跃进的速度越快。
    拿工业来说，在军阀统治和日伪统治时期，民族工业受到严重的掠夺和压榨，解放初期工业雕敝得几乎没什么了。因此，在吉林省来说，白城专区的工业基础是很差的，也是比较落后的。解放以后有了迅速的发展。和解放初期相比，真是有天壤之别。1949年全区工业总产值只有一千八百多万元，1957年发展到八千一百七十四万二千元，到1958年发展到一万二千九百八十八万元，到1959年，已发展到一万六千八百八十六万多元，今年计划发展到二亿多元，比十一年前增十倍多。白城地区的工业发展得很快，产量多、品种多、质量好，结束了不生产钢铁的历史，煤炭生产有一定基础了，石油生产大有前途，机械工业也在前进中。轻工业的生产如造纸、麻袋、火碱、毛纺、纸浆、罐头、奶粉、糖、粮米加工有如雨后春笋；人民公社的社办工业，也是遍地开花，万紫千红。
    1954年以后，特别是人民公社成立以后，农业生产更是飞跃前进。一向多灾多难的八百里旱海连年获得了大丰收。自从1954年以来，白城地区就结束国家年年调入粮食的状况。1945年以前，无论荒、旱饿死多少人，是没人管的，自然不会调入多少粮食。解放后，从1949年到1953年的五年中，国家给八百里旱海调入的粮食共达十八万二千七百三十一吨，平均每年调入粮食三万六千五百多吨。另外，这五年国家拨给的救济款共达五十二万九千元之多。从这里看出，党和政府的关怀和支持，是八百里旱海人民走上幸福生活的重要保障。这就是我们社会制度的无比的优越性。
    人民公社无比优越，农业“八字宪法”到处开花，秋深翻地效果很好，水利工作也取得了很大的成绩。更重要的是麦田可以复种荞麦、大白菜、糜子、胡萝卜，而且产量很高，打破了认为八百里旱海上不能复种的保守思想，从而给白城地区多种多收和精种高产，增加了新的内容，挖掘出增产的更大潜力。这些事实证明，只要认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，进一步实现农业的现代化，农业的发展前途就更远大。现在我们已由一个年年需要国家调粮并投放大批救济款的地区，而变成一个粮食自给有余并交出大批公粮购粮的地区，由每人占有粮食数很少的地区，成为每人占有粮食比较高的地区。这种状况的改变，是党的领导的胜利，农业“八字宪法”的胜利，人民公社的胜利。1959年我们全区按农村人口计算，平均每人占有粮食一千七百斤以上。因为农业增产的潜力还很大，有利条件很多，1960年的一百七十万零七千吨的粮食任务是有保证的。那时，农村人口平均就占有粮食二千斤了。
    在畜牧业方面，白城地区有广阔的草原，群众有经营畜牧业生产的习惯，而且有一定基础。解放前，大牲畜不过二十万头，1949年大牲畜只有二十四万多头，猪只有三万八千头，羊只有六万只。1959年底猪的存栏数，已达四十七万七千七百八十五口，比1958年末净增40．06％。大家畜已发展到六十万零四百五十三头，净增9．8％；羊达到三十九万三千二百五十一只，净增39％；其它家禽、兔、蜂和野生动物的饲养也有新的发展。现在，出现了不少马产双驹、牛产双犊、羊产五羔、母猪一年产百子孙的奇迹。认真按着党的发展畜牧业的方针政策办事，猪为六畜之首，养猪为畜牧事业的中心，将一母猪年产百子孙的典型经验，提高为百母年产万子孙的群众运动。今年力争完成全区有二百万口猪的光荣的任务。大家畜今年计划发展到六十五万多头，年净增8．3％，要抓住全配全准，全生、全壮的工作。羊今年计划发展到四十八万七千五百只，净增24％，要开展百母百子，千母千子，万母万子的运动。在畜牧业方面，今后要注意质量数量并重和役、肉、毛、乳、皮、粪等多用，并抓好水、草料、种、繁、管、防、工等项工作。白城地区的畜牧业是很有潜力的，很有发展前途的。
    在林业方面，这里解放前是荒山秃岭、荒漠的草原。解放后，林业也有了迅速的发展。现在已有四十多万公顷的林地了，特别是用拖拉机造的三万多公顷树林，已长成三米左右的木材，形成纵横交织的林网和林海，它起着防风固沙调节气候的作用。二千多垧的果树，已有20％开花结果。人们把自己种的第一次结的最好的水果寄到北京献给毛主席。杏、桃、李、苹果、沙果、海棠、草莓、葡萄等，八百里旱海上到处都有了。我们今年还准备种九万二千公顷防风树木和二千八百公顷水果和葡萄。力争在二、三年内全区每人有一棵葡萄，三、四年后每人有十棵葡萄，使人民吃到自己种的更多的水果，喝到自己酿造的葡萄酒和果子露。现在全区人民正以冲天的干劲，来绿化、香化、彩化、甜化、美化自己的社会主义的幸福家园。
    人民公社无比的优越性和旺盛的生命力，使白城地区的生产一年比一年高涨，人民的收入一年比一年增加，人民的生活一年比一年富裕美满。现在人民吃的粮食不但足用了，而且还有10％多的自己种出来的细粮。1959年因为人民公社力量大，白城地区种了八万四千多公顷小麦获得了大丰收，摘掉了小麦低产的帽子，还交了近三万吨的小麦公购粮。人民公社使人们吃上用自己种的粮食做的白面饺子和又白又香的大米饭。生产发展，生活提高，吃饭由粗变细。人们穿的和住的也比从前强的多了。人民公社社员在信贷部里普遍有存款。解放以来，这个地区的广大劳动人民，在政治思想上，在道德品质上，在社会主义觉悟上，在共产主义风格上，都有很大的提高。这些无价财富，比钢铁、煤炭、机械、粮食、牲畜、科学文化成果更宝贵。
    我们坚决听党中央和毛主席的话，按着上级党委指示的方向奋进。我们坚决加强党的领导，依靠群众，破除迷信，解放思想，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，使白城地区的工业生产、农林牧副渔五业生产和其他各项工作，能够持续跃进。
