Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: According to TASS, advanced agricultural workers in Ukraine are actively writing books to impart their advanced experiences. Following the publication of thirty-two books written by collective farm members last year, the Ukrainian Agricultural Book Publishing Bureau will publish thirty-six books written by advanced agricultural workers this year. The authors of these books include tractor drivers, production team leaders, milkmaids, and fruit tree growers.

Alexander Rozhko, a nationally renowned agricultural innovator and captain of the tractor team of the "Ukraine" collective farm in the Nikolaev region, wrote "Using the Power of Tractor Teams for Livestock Breeding." He suggests raising livestock in field sheds. Last year, his tractor team raised 3,000 head of livestock, and this year he proposes to raise 8,000 head. The cost of raising livestock in this way is very low. Rozhko describes his work experience in this book, and now more than a thousand tractor teams in Ukraine are following his example.

Socialist Labor Hero Vera Sidora wrote a booklet entitled "Having One Million, Will Have Two Million." She describes how she raised 6,000 hens last year, obtaining one million eggs, and will raise 12,000 hens this year, obtaining two million eggs.

    把自己的先进生产经验系统化
    乌克兰农业劳动者纷纷著书立说
    新华社莫斯科15日电　据塔斯社报道：乌克兰先进农业劳动者纷纷积极写书，传授先进经验。乌克兰农业书籍出版局继去年出版了三十二本集体农庄庄员所写的书之后，今年将出版三十六本农业先进工作者所写的书。这些书的执笔人有拖拉机手、生产队队长、挤奶员、果木种植员等。
    全苏闻名的农业革新者、尼古拉耶夫州“乌克兰”集体农庄拖拉机队队长亚历山大·罗日科写了“运用拖拉机队的力量来进行牲畜饲养”，他建议在田间窝棚内饲养牲畜。去年他的拖拉机队饲养了三千头，今年提出要饲养八千头。用这种方式来饲养牲畜所耗费的成本很低，罗日科在这本书内叙述了工作经验，现在乌克兰已有千余个拖拉机队效法他的经验。
    社会主义劳动英雄维拉·西多拉写了一本“有了一百万，将有二百万”的小册子。她叙述了如何在去年饲养六千只母鸡，获得一百万枚鸡蛋，并将在今年饲养一万二千只母鸡，获得二百万枚鸡蛋。
