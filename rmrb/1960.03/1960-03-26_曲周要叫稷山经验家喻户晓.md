Following the Jishan Conference, the Quzhou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province immediately formulated a comprehensive plan for health work in 1960 and a current health work plan. It successively convened meetings of party organization secretaries at all levels, heads of relevant departments, and medical personnel, disseminating and mobilizing at each level. The county committee established a pest elimination and disease control headquarters, led by the secretary, to strengthen leadership. The masses widely studied the experience of Jishan County, achieving universal knowledge and making it a household name.

On February 5th this year, Quzhou County launched a mass spring pest elimination and disease control campaign centered on supporting spring plowing and production, with over 200,000 people rapidly joining the movement. By February 15th, the county had renovated 3,619 toilets, 281 livestock sheds, improved 212 drinking water wells, and planted over 298,500 trees to green the villages. In order to improve the health knowledge level of the broad masses of commune members, various communes generally adopted methods combining phased and batch-based approaches, decentralization and centralization, systematic lectures and on-site visits, and trained cadres without releasing them from production. Currently, over 280,000 people in the county have received health knowledge education.

Medical and health personnel throughout the county also actively took action, leaving hospitals, carrying medicines, and providing medical care door-to-door and in the fields. Since the beginning of spring, the county has basically not experienced infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, pertussis, and diphtheria, and the labor attendance rate has reached over 98%.

    曲周要叫稷山经验家喻户晓
    本报讯　稷山会议后，中共河北曲周县委立即制订了1960年卫生工作全面规划和当前卫生工作方案，先后连续召开了各级党组织书记会、各有关部门负责人以及医务人员大会，层层传达，层层发动。县委成立了除害灭病指挥部，书记挂帅，加强领导。群众广泛地学习了稷山县经验，达到人人皆知，家喻户晓。
    今年2月5日，曲周县揭开了以支援春耕生产为中心的群众性春季除害灭病运动的序幕，全县二十多万人迅速投入了这一运动。到2月15日，全县又修整厕所三千六百一十九个，牲畜棚圈二百八十一个，改良饮水井二百一十二个，绿化村庄植树二十九万八千五百多棵。各公社为了提高广大社员的卫生知识水平，普遍采取分期分批、分散与集中、系统讲课与现场参观相结合的方法，集训了不脱产的干部。现在，全县已有二十八万多人受到卫生知识教育。
    全县医务卫生人员也积极行动起来，纷纷走出医院，携带药品，登门下地医疗。入春以来，全县基本上没有发生流感、麻疹、百日咳、白喉等传染病，劳动出勤率达到98％以上。
