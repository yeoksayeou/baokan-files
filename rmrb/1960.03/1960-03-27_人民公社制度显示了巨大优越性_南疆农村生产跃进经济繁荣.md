The establishment of the people's commune has completely changed the historically poor and backward conditions in the rural areas of southern Xinjiang and opened up broad avenues for the rapid development of agriculture.

The four regions of Korla, Aksu, Kashgar, and Hotan, and the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture in southern Xinjiang, are the main agricultural areas of Xinjiang. The climate is mild, the soil and water resources are abundant, and the frost-free period is about 200 days or more. Not only do they produce various grains, but they are also ideal cotton-growing areas in China. Before communization, the Uyghur farmers here, under the leadership of the Party, made great progress in agricultural production. However, due to the small scale of the cooperatives, limited funds, and weak strength, the soil and water resources could not be fully utilized, and the speed of agricultural development was slow. After the establishment of the people's communes in 1958, an unprecedented mass movement of water conservancy construction and land reclamation was launched, opening a new chapter in the history of agricultural development in southern Xinjiang. In 1959, agricultural production achieved a leap forward compared with 1957 before communization: the cultivated area expanded from more than 13 million mu to more than 18 million mu, the total grain output increased by more than 70% compared with 1957, and the total cotton output increased by more than 60%.

Southern Xinjiang is located in the hinterland of the Asian continent, and the Taklamakan Desert accounts for nearly half of the total area. The soil and water resources are abundant, but the climate is extremely dry. Before communization, in Kashgar Prefecture alone, more than 2 million mu of farmland suffered from varying degrees of reduced production due to water shortage every year. The farmland in the lower reaches of many rivers was also seriously affected by the expansion of cultivated area and the increase in unit area yield due to soil marshing and salinization caused by flood overflow and poor irrigation methods. For many years, the Uyghur farmers in these areas cherished the desire to control these rivers. After communization, Kashgar Prefecture organized more than 300,000 laborers last year to launch a large-scale water conservancy movement to comprehensively control the Yarkand River, Kizil River, and Gez River. After more than four months of hard work and ingenuity, most of the projects were completed. During the dry season from January to June this year, the water volume can be increased by more than 400 million cubic meters. After the completion of the entire project, the annual water volume can be increased by 1 billion cubic meters, which can improve the irrigation area by 3 million mu and expand the irrigation area by 600,000 mu. Hannanlik Commune, located in the lower reaches of the Gez River, had 10,000 to 20,000 mu of land that could not be sown due to water shortage every year in the past, and was unable to achieve self-sufficiency in grain until 1958. After the establishment of the commune, more than 20,000 members worked hard for a winter and a spring, newly built 3,385 large and small channels with a total length of 860 kilometers, and newly built more than 10,000 sluice gates, thereby completely reversing the water shortage situation, making the unit area yield of wheat in 1959 increased by 33% compared with 1958, and the total output increased by 54.9%. Other crops also achieved bumper harvests, which not only changed the grain shortage situation in the past, but also sold a large amount of surplus grain.

With the solution of the water conservancy problem, large tracts of wasteland have been reclaimed and turned into fertile paddy fields. In the past two years, the people's communes in Korla, Aksu, Kashgar, Hotan, and Kizilsu Autonomous Prefecture have organized hundreds of thousands of land reclamation troops to cooperate with the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to attack the ancient wilderness of Tarim, expanding the cultivated area by more than 5 million mu. In November last year, the 45 people's communes in the seven counties of Hotan Prefecture transferred more than 50,000 young and middle-aged people to form an expeditionary land reclamation team to reclaim land in the barren beaches and Gobi deserts far away from their homes. So far, 600,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, which is equivalent to about 25% of the total sown area of the entire prefecture last year, laying a solid foundation for expanding spring sowing crops this year.

The people's commune has fully utilized the labor potential. While vigorously building water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, and expanding the sown area, various localities have also vigorously reformed farming techniques and carried out intensive cultivation, so that the extensive farming situation in the past has been rapidly changed. In the past, in southern Xinjiang, due to the disorder of rivers and canal systems, coupled with backward irrigation methods such as flooding irrigation, about 60% of the cultivated land in the lower reaches of various rivers had varying degrees of salinization. After communization, after leveling the land, greatly changing the old irrigation area, implementing small-furrow irrigation, and vigorously building drainage ditches, in just over a year, more than 4 million mu of cultivated land has been initially realized into garden land, and more than 2 million mu of saline-alkali land has been gradually improved. The 428 mu of land abandoned by Awati Commune in Korla County in the past due to salinization was planted with corn, and the average yield per mu reached more than 300 jin.

The more than 700,000 mu of cotton planted in Kashgar Prefecture last year, thanks to the unified organization of professional teams by the commune, the comprehensive promotion of rational close planting, diligent weeding, intertillage, timely and appropriate rational fertilization, ditch irrigation and small-furrow irrigation, and a set of scientific cotton field management measures such as fine pruning, the average yield per mu reached 80 jin of ginned cotton, and two counties with 100 jin of ginned cotton appeared, catching up with the cotton production level of the advanced areas of the Han nationality. In terms of the improvement of production tools, it has also jumped from mostly using manual tools in the past to a new stage of basically semi-mechanized farming.

The great prosperity of the rural economy after communization has also promoted the rapid development of industry in the southern Xinjiang region. Before communization, there were only a dozen modern factories and mines here. By 1959, the number of industrial enterprises had developed to more than 550, including modern factories and mines such as metallurgy, mining, coal, cement, machinery, electricity, and silk reeling, with a total industrial output value of more than 250 million yuan. More than 500 commune industries have been established, with an output value of more than 20 million yuan, which have increased several times to dozens of times compared with before communization.

With the great development of various productions, the economic life of more than 3 million Uyghur farmers in southern Xinjiang has been significantly improved. Communes have generally established canteens, and have also set up public welfare undertakings such as kindergartens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, maternity hospitals, and medical care, so that more than 90% of women have participated in various productions, greatly increasing family income. The income of the commune members of the people's communes in various places is generally about half higher than before communization. Now the people's communes in various places are planning new residential villages to improve the living conditions of the vast number of commune members.

    人民公社制度显示了巨大优越性
    南疆农村生产跃进经济繁荣
    本报讯　人民公社的建立，彻底改变了新疆南部地区农村历史上遗留下来的贫穷落后面貌，为农业的迅速发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    南疆的库尔勒、阿克苏、喀什、和田等四个专区和克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州，是新疆的主要农业区，气候温和，水土资源丰富，无霜期约在二百天以上，不但出产各种谷物，并且是我国理想的植棉区。公社化前，这里的维吾尔族农民在党的领导下，农业生产有很大发展，但由于合作社的范围小，资金有限，力量单薄，水土资源不能充分利用，农业发展速度较慢。1958年人民公社成立后，开展了史无前例的大兴水利和开荒造田的大生产运动，揭开了南疆农业发展史上新的一页。1959年农业生产比公社化前的1957年有了飞跃发展：耕地面积由原来的一千三百多万亩，扩大到一千八百多万亩，粮食总产量比1957年增加了70％以上，棉花总产量增加了60％多。
    南疆处于亚洲大陆的腹地，塔克拉玛干大沙漠占去总面积的近一半地区，水土资源丰富，气候却异常干旱。公社化前，仅喀什专区每年就有二百多万亩农田因缺水发生程度不同的减产。许多河流下游的农田也因洪水漫溢和灌溉方法不良，造成土壤沼泽化和盐碱化，严重地影响耕地面积的扩大和单位面积产量的提高。多少年来，这些地区的维吾尔农民都怀着制服这些河流的愿望，公社化后，喀什专区去年组织了三十多万民工，展开了全面综合治理叶尔羌河、克孜河、盖孜河的大规模水利运动，经过四个多月的实干巧干完成了大部分工程，在今年1至6月枯水期可增加水量四亿多立方，全部工程完成后全年可增加水量十亿立方，能改善灌溉面积三百万亩，扩大灌溉面积六十万亩。位于盖孜河下游的罕南力克公社，过去每年都有一两万亩土地因缺水不能下种，直到1958年粮食还不能自给。公社成立后，二万多名社员大干了一冬一春，新修了大小渠道三千三百八十五条，长达八百六十公里，新修闸门一万多处，从而彻底扭转了缺水状况，使1959年小麦单位面积产量较1958年提高了33％，总产增加了54．9％。其他作物也都获得大丰收，不仅改变了历年来缺粮状况，还卖出了大批余粮。
    随着水利问题的解决，大片荒地被开垦出来，变成肥沃的水田。两年来，库尔勒、阿克苏、喀什、和阗和克孜勒苏自治州等地的人民公社，组织了数十万开荒大军配合新疆生产建设兵团向塔里木的亘古荒原进攻，扩大了耕地面积五百多万亩。和田专区七个县的四十五个人民公社，在去年11月间抽调了五万多名青壮年组成了远征开荒队，到远离家乡的荒滩戈壁开荒造田，到目前为止，已开垦了六十万亩荒地，等于去年全专区播种面积的25％左右，为今年扩大春播作物打下了雄厚基础。
    人民公社充分发挥了劳动潜力，各地在大兴水利、开荒造田扩大播种面积的同时，还大力改革耕作技术，大搞精耕细作，使过去粗放的耕作状况迅速改变。南疆各地过去由于河流渠系紊乱，再加上大水漫灌等落后的灌溉方法，使各河下游60％左右的耕地都发生了程度不等的盐碱化现象。公社化后，经过平整土地、大改旧灌区、实行小畦灌溉、大兴排碱沟等，一年多的时间，就使四百多万亩耕地初步实现了园田化，并逐步改良了二百多万亩盐碱土地。库尔勒县阿瓦提公社过去被盐碱化所逼放弃的四百二十八亩土地种上了玉米，平均每亩产量达到了三百斤以上。
    喀什专区去年种植的七十多万亩棉花，由于公社统一组织了专业队，全面推广了合理密植、勤锄草、中耕，适时适量合理施肥，沟灌和小畦灌溉，以及精细整枝等一套科学的棉田管理措施，使每亩平均产量达到皮棉八十斤，并出现了两个百斤皮棉县，赶上了汉族先进地区的棉产水平。在生产工具的改进方面，也由过去大都使用手工工具跨跃到基本是半机械化耕种的新阶段。
    公社化后农村经济的大繁荣也促进了南疆地区工业的迅速发展。公社化前这里只有十几个现代化厂矿，到1959年工业企业已发展到了五百五十多个，包括有冶金、采矿、煤炭、水泥、机械、电力、缫丝等现代化的厂矿，工业总产值达到两亿五千多万元。公社工业兴办起五百多个，产值在两千万元以上，都较公社化前增加了几倍到几十倍。
    随着各项生产大发展，南疆三百多万维吾尔农民的经济生活显著提高。公社普遍建立了食堂，还举办了幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院、妇产院以及医疗等公共福利事业，使90％以上的妇女参加了各项生产，大大增加了家庭收入。各地人民公社社员的收入一般都较公社化前增加一半左右。现在各地人民公社正纷纷规划居民新村，改善广大社员的居住条件。
