    Greatly Strive Through Winter and Spring: Learning from Hanshou and Transforming into Jishan
    (Reported by our newspaper) Under the leadership of the Hanshou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province, a movement of "Learning from Jishan and Catching up with Jishan" has recently been launched throughout the county.
    "If Jishan County in Shanxi Province can do it, so can we," is the firm resolution of the 400,000 people in the county. Xu Deyou, Secretary of the Hanshou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, boldly proposed at a general mobilization radio conference for the entire county: "Greatly strive through winter and spring, transform Hanshou into Jishan, continue to make continuous breakthroughs, and continue to advance victoriously!" In order to improve the collective hygiene work of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other institutions, the Cuijiaqiao Commune in this county immediately sent more than ten full-time cadres to go deep into the brigades to strengthen leadership.
    In the past week, the county has eliminated many overwintering "four pests," and over 80% of the canteens have achieved regular sanitation. The incidence of winter infectious diseases has been consistently controlled at around 0.05%, and the labor attendance rate has reached over 90%, effectively supporting production and presenting a new picture of cleanliness and orderliness throughout the county.

    大干一冬春汉寿稷山化
    本报讯　湖南汉寿县在县委领导下，最近已在全县范围内掀起了一个“学稷山，赶稷山”运动。
    “山西稷山县能做得到，我们也能做得到”，这是全县四十多万人民群众的坚强决心。中共汉寿县委书记徐德友在全县总动员的广播大会上豪迈地提出了：“大干一冬春，汉寿稷山化，继续不断突击，继续乘胜前进”的战斗号召。这个县的崔家桥公社为了把公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体卫生工作做得更好，立即派了十多名专职干部，深入大队，加强领导。
    一星期来，全县消灭了不少越冬四害，有80％以上的食堂的卫生做到了经常化。冬季传染病的发病率始终控制在万分之五左右，劳动出勤率达90％以上，有力地支援了生产，使全县出现了一幅清洁整齐的新气象。
