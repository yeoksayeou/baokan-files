The first secretaries or secretaries of the district committees, county committees, and Party committees of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai are personally taking command, leading the development of the campaign.

On the 25th, Luwan District mobilized 130,000 people for cleaning, inspection, and propaganda. The Third Residents' Committee of Fuxing Middle Road, which has been a city-wide health banner since 1953, used eight methods, including scraping, flushing, burning, and applying medicine, to dig out twelve tons of pupae and sludge on the afternoon of the 26th. Shanghai workers, who are enthusiastically engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution, also arranged time to clean workshops and outdoor environmental sanitation.

On the evening of the 25th, the Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a "Radio and Television Mobilization Meeting for Vigorously Launching the Spring Health Campaign." The meeting proposed to resolutely implement the combat call issued by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, seize the opportunity, and work hard to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th – The broad masses of the people of Tianjin warmly responded to the Party's call, taking action themselves, coordinating with the production movement, vigorously eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and launching a new high tide in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases.

Since the beginning of spring, the broad masses of the people of Tianjin have concentrated their efforts on environmental sanitation, eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. According to statistics from the city's seven districts, from February 5th to mid-March, more than four million person-times were mobilized to remove more than 152,000 tons of garbage and clean and fill in a large number of polluted water pits, depressions, and ditches. In this month and a half, a million people were also organized to carry out a large-scale pupae digging activity. The vast numbers of disinfection team members and health activists have cleaned up sewage ditches, public toilets, livestock pens, and other places where mosquitoes and flies easily breed.

Recently, according to the arrangements of the Municipal Party Committee, the district committees of the Chinese Communist Party, led by the first secretaries of the district committees, seriously discussed and studied how to further strengthen health work, and convened secretaries of the Party committees of various streets and secretaries of the Party committees of relevant departments to make specific arrangements. The broad masses of the people actively responded to the Party's call, and on the evening of the 22nd alone, more than 580,000 people were mobilized in various districts to participate in this movement. On the 26th, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also held a meeting of Party member cadres. At the meeting, Wang Kangzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on all Communist Party members and the broad masses of the people to immediately mobilize, make a big splash, create momentum, vigorously eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and raise the patriotic health campaign to a new level.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th – The people of Jinan City are vigorously clearing garbage, renovating toilets, eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and carrying out a spring pest elimination, disease prevention, safety, and sanitation blitz.

In the movement, all streets, schools, government offices, and factories in the city implemented the principles of combining blitzes with regular work, combining fundamental solutions with stopgap measures, combining ideological education with administrative management, and combining block leadership with departmental leadership, as well as the method of dividing areas and assigning responsibility. As a result, the streets and alleys of the city are clean, the indoor and outdoor environments are tidy and hygienic, and the furniture is clean and bright. Residents of the Sili Street East Section, a national health red banner unit, have implemented a running water hand-washing method. On the evening of the 22nd, the city held a spring pest elimination, disease prevention, safety, and sanitation campaign radio oath-taking rally, requiring industrial departments to remove accumulated garbage by the end of March and early April, and to establish professional teams to ensure that garbage is removed as it accumulates; to plant a large number of trees, flowers, and green plants to beautify the environment, so that the vast number of workers can be more energetic in production and construction; and to ensure that food hygiene and the hygiene work of collective welfare undertakings are done effectively, so as to ensure the health of the people of the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th – The movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in Hangzhou City is surging forward with the force of ten thousand horses.

In the past month, countless government cadres, PLA officers and soldiers, teachers and students of universities and middle schools, and street residents have been involved in the health campaign every day. All areas prone to breeding mosquitoes and flies, such as rivers, ponds, depressions, urn vats, wells, and livestock sheds, have been comprehensively managed. The propaganda and prevention and control of spring respiratory infectious diseases are also being carried out effectively. At present, various respiratory infectious diseases have decreased by 67% to 99% compared with the same period last year.

In this vigorous movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, the broad masses of the people are full of fighting spirit and are widely carrying out technological innovations. In the blitz to fundamentally eliminate the four pests, focusing on filling rivers, all the labor armies have been making great efforts in motorization and aerial transportation of soil, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. In the work of capturing and destroying overwintering mosquitoes and flies, innovative deeds have also emerged one after another.

The leadership of the secretaries and the mobilization of all the people are the fundamental reasons for the vigorous development of the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in Hangzhou City. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially convened a meeting of district committee secretaries and responsible persons of relevant departments to deploy the city's work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, proposing to strive to reduce mosquitoes and flies in urban areas, especially in the West Lake scenic area, to the point of being non-existent, so as to make the health movement enter a stage of leap-forward development. From the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee to the Party and government departments of the districts, and to the grass-roots units and street residential areas, the Party committee secretaries have taken the lead and established leading groups for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene or command headquarters for various blitzes, made long-term and current work plans, mobilized the masses, and cooperated in the battle.

    最近，中共各区区委根据市委的部署，由区委第一书记挂帅，认真讨论研究如何进一步加强卫生工作，并且召集各街道党委书记和有关部门的党委书记作了具体部署。广大群众积极响应党的号召，仅22日一个晚上各区就出动了五十八万多人投入这一运动。中共天津市委在26日还召开了党员干部大会，会上，中共天津市委书记处书记王亢之号召全市共产党员和广大人民立即动员起来，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大除四害，大讲卫生，把爱国卫生运动提高到一个新的水平。

    在运动中，全市各街道、学校、机关、工厂实行了突击与经常相结合、治本与治标相结合、思想教育与行政管理相结合、块块领导与条条领导相结合的原则和划片包干的方法，因而做到全市大街小巷都很清洁，室内室外整洁卫生，日用家具干净明亮。全国卫生红旗单位司里街东段居民已实行流水洗手法。22日晚，全市举行了春季除害灭病安全卫生运动广播誓师大会，要求工业部门在3月底4月初将积存的垃圾清除出去，并设立专业队伍，作到随积随清除；大量栽植树木、花草、绿化美化环境，使广大职工更加精力充沛地投入生产建设；并且要求切实作好饮食卫生和集体福利事业的卫生工作，保证全市人民的健康。
