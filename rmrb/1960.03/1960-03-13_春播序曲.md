    Prelude to Spring Planting
    By our correspondent Cui Yongchang
    This year's snowfall in the central regions of the Soviet Union has been heavy. In Noginsk District of Moscow Oblast, the snow is waist-deep, and the fertile land is sleeping under a layer of snow as thick as one meter. Locals say that this is the heaviest snowfall in over a decade. Their excited words reveal their boundless joy at the saying "A timely snow promises a good harvest."
    The Russian Winter Festival has just passed, and according to the calendar, there is only a little over a month left before spring plowing. However, preparations for spring plowing have already begun in various parts of the Soviet Union. As early as the end of last year, immediately after the conclusion of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, agricultural workers in various parts of the Soviet Union began to formulate their production plans for 1960. They aim to contribute to the construction of communism in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan with a comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production. One initiative after another from the Soviet rural working people has emerged, with the goal of completing the Seven-Year Plan two or three years ahead of schedule becoming their common objective. The initiative put forward by Konstantinovka Village in Stalin Oblast to strive for a harvest of 200 poods of grain per hectare has also been widely echoed.
    Moscow Oblast is certainly no exception. The oblast has put forward the slogan of completing the Seven-Year Plan in four years and has launched a heated competition with Kiev Oblast in Ukraine. In the Moscow Oblast Agricultural Administration, one can see various guarantees for the oblast's efforts to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Gushev, the director of the administration, told us that in order to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Moscow Oblast will vigorously increase yields per unit area this year, achieving 18 to 20 quintals of grain per hectare, 125 quintals of potatoes per hectare, and fulfilling the meat production plan by 200 percent, striving to produce 160,000 tons of meat for the state. We asked Comrade Gushev what the central issue is in completing this task. He replied that among the most important issues, the work currently being done with all efforts is the massive accumulation and application of fertilizer. He said that Moscow Oblast will accumulate about 20 million tons of fertilizer this year, averaging about 18 tons of fertilizer per hectare, which is more than double last year's amount. Comrade Gushev also said: "Currently, all districts and all collective and state farms in Moscow Oblast are vigorously accumulating fertilizer because they know that only by applying large amounts of fertilizer can they continuously increase grain yields, and only by vigorously accumulating fertilizer can they harvest more fodder. Therefore, it can be said that fertilizer accumulation is currently a central issue."
    An Inexhaustible Fertilizer Reservoir
    Noginsk District in Moscow Oblast is located at one end of the Meshchera Lowlands. One of the characteristics of this area is its numerous lakes and swamps and its rich peat resources. At the Noginsk Soil Improvement Station, we saw a soil classification map, which was covered with circles of various colors. Leiterko, the head of the Soil Improvement Station, explained to us with the map that these circles indicate peat distribution areas. The total area of peat in Noginsk District reaches more than 1,800 hectares, with a total reserve of more than 20 million cubic meters. In other words, the entire district could use it for 20 or 30 years without running out.
      The word "peat" seems to be exclusively for industrial use. It can be used as fuel in thermal power plants or factories, as an insulator in the construction industry, and as a raw material for the chemical industry; however, the biggest use of peat is in agriculture. Using peat as fertilizer is most appropriate in Moscow Oblast because it is abundant, any farm can find it nearby; it is convenient to develop, requires no large investment, and the effect after fertilization is good.
    Agronomists at the Soil Improvement Station also told us that peat can be divided into three types according to quality: upper peat, lower peat, and transitional peat. Among them, lower peat is the most suitable for fertilizer because it contains more humus, has a low acid content, and is easy to mix with manure, ammonia, and other substances. This type of lower peat accounts for more than 1,400 hectares of the more than 1,800 hectares of peat in Noginsk District.
    Accumulating and applying fertilizer in conditions with a lot of ice and snow is somewhat difficult because the peat is all buried under thick snowdrifts, and the roads are often covered with ice and snow. However, the working people of Noginsk District, inspired by the Seven-Year Plan, are overcoming these difficulties with confidence, and the fertilizer accumulation work is currently proceeding at an ever-increasing pace. The two working teams of the Soil Improvement Station alone have prepared 65,000 tons of peat fertilizer in the past four months. In addition, the collective farms have also exploited their own potential to transport fertilizer. In many places, one can see sleds rushing across the fields carrying fertilizer, and in many places, tractors are used to drag large iron plates to transport fertilizer. Workers from many factories also come to participate in the work during their rest time, and drivers from government organizations and groups also voluntarily sign up to participate in fertilizer transportation. This high level of enthusiasm has resulted in an unprecedented scale of fertilizer accumulation work in Moscow Oblast this year.
      The Creations of the Fertilizer Accumulation Teams
    The "Chapayev" Collective Farm in Noginsk District is a farm with more than 2,000 hectares of land. Excluding pastures and forests, there are more than 800 hectares of cultivated land. The first impression after arriving at this farm is that there are many forests and the air is humid. The farm members told us that if you come here in the summer, it's like being in a park.
    In the middle of the "Chapayev" Collective Farm, there is a swampy area, which is the peat production area. A fertilizer accumulation team from the Soil Improvement Station works here. Even two or three kilometers away from the construction site, we could hear the sound of machines running. When we arrived at the construction site, we saw twenty or thirty young people working hard in the vast white snow. After the car stopped, Yakovlev, the chairman of the collective farm, took us to the place where the peat was piled up. He picked up a piece of peat and said that this was their farm's "treasure."
    The chairman of the farm also told us that they plan to accumulate 17,000 tons of fertilizer this year, with an average of about 20 tons of fertilizer per hectare for general crops. However, last year they conducted a bold experiment, applying 100 tons of fertilizer per hectare on a cornfield, and the harvest increased by about two times compared to normal. Comrade Yakovlev said that this year the experiment will continue, and they have decided to apply 150 tons of fertilizer per hectare on 45 hectares of cornfields; in addition, they will apply 100 tons of fertilizer per hectare on 125 hectares of potato fields. In this way, the yield can be greatly increased. In order to carry out this experiment, the fertilizer accumulation task is greater than in previous years. In addition to the fertilizer accumulation team from the Soil Improvement Station, the farm has also mobilized all sleds and horses to carry out fertilizer transportation work.
    After learning about the farm's intentions, the fertilizer accumulation team also decided to vigorously support the farm. Regardless of the severe cold and ice and snow, they began to march towards the swamp in the face of the cold wind. Excavators roared, extending their huge excavator buckets to the treasure trove of peat, "grabbing" tons of peat and loading it onto trucks. In addition, there are several bulldozers that simply drive onto the swamp, layer by layer, pushing the coal up to form small hills. But this still cannot satisfy the workers because the excavator loading is still a bit slow, and there are not many excavators. Under these circumstances, the workers of the fertilizer accumulation team collectively designed a wooden trestle bridge, and after pushing the peat up, they can fill a dozen trucks in a few minutes. Stepanov, the captain of the fertilizer accumulation team, said that with this trestle bridge, the amount of fertilizer transported every day can reach about 1,200 tons, so the fertilizer accumulation task of this farm can be completed in less than half a month. One Ton of Peat Turns into Three Tons of Mixed Fertilizer
    In the fertilizer accumulation work in Moscow Oblast, there is also a new method that is being vigorously promoted this year, which is to use peat as bedding for livestock. According to agricultural experts, if peat with a moisture content of 40% is used as bedding for livestock, after seven to ten days, one ton of peat can be turned into three tons of high-quality mixed fertilizer.
    This new method has been tested for three years in the "May 1st" Collective Farm in Noginsk District, and the effect is good. However, before the large-scale promotion this year, some local cattle breeders, pig farmers, and milkers had some concerns. They said that after using peat as bedding, the livestock would definitely be covered in mud and make the cattle and pig houses dirty. After the District Party Committee and the District Soviet Agricultural Department learned about this situation, they held an on-site meeting at the "May 1st" Farm, and representatives from the cattle and pig farmers of each farm were sent to participate in the meeting. After they visited the cattle house of the "May 1st" Farm, they believed in the benefits of using peat as bedding.
    When we arrived at the cattle house of the "Chapayev" Collective Farm, they were already accustomed to using peat as bedding. The cattle breeders told us that every ten days, several trucks loaded with processed peat come to the cattle house, and after unloading these peat, the trucks transport the "processed" peat to the fields.
    Yakovlev, the chairman of the farm, said that this cattle house with 120 cows has now become a fertilizer factory of the farm. Each time, only 50 tons of peat are used as bedding, and after ten days, it becomes 150 tons of mixed fertilizer.
    What changes have taken place in the cattle house after using peat as bedding? I asked Zekova, an old cattle breeder who has worked in the cattle house for twenty years. She said: "The first change is that the cattle house is cleaner because the smell of cow dung and cow urine can be absorbed by the peat. The second change is that the temperature in the cattle house has also increased because the peat is padded to a thickness of thirty or forty centimeters, which is better at resisting the cold than padding with grass..."
    The chairman of the farm immediately added: "The third change is that the incidence of cattle diseases has decreased, and the fourth change is that the cattle house has become a fertilizer factory." He jokingly asked Zekova: "Do you still want bedding grass now?"
    Zekova said: "Now our requirement is to transport more peat to us so that we have a reserve."
    When we walked out of the cattle house, we saw the early spring sun shining brightly on the white snow, and sleds were speeding on the smooth path. The chairman of the farm said: "Now the farm is checking seeds and machines, and after the snow melts, we will start the battle of the second year of the Seven-Year Plan." He said that everyone on their farm is full of confidence and will definitely complete their assigned tasks ahead of schedule in the first year of the 1960s. (Attached picture)

    春播序曲
    本报记者　崔永昌
    苏联中部地区今年降雪量很大，在莫斯科州诺金斯克区到处是没腰的深雪，肥沃的土地沉睡在厚达一米深的积雪下面。当地人说，这是十几年没有过的好雪。他们兴奋的话语中，流露出对于“瑞雪兆丰年”的无限喜悦之情。
    俄罗斯冬节刚过去不久，按照节令来说，离春耕还只剩下一个多月的时间了。但是春耕的准备工作在苏联各地早已经开始。还在去年年底苏共中央十二月全会刚闭幕的时候，苏联各地农业工作者就纷纷拟订了1960年的生产计划，他们要用农业生产的全面丰收在七年计划的第二年为共产主义建设作出贡献。苏联农村劳动人民的创议一个接着一个，提前两年或三年完成七年计划，成了他们共同奋斗的目标。斯大林诺州康斯坦金诺夫卡村提出的争取每公顷收获粮食二百普特的倡议，也得到了广泛响应。
    莫斯科州当然也不例外，这个州提出了七年计划四年完成的口号，并且与乌克兰的基辅州展开了热烈的竞赛。在莫斯科州农业管理局可以看到这个州争取提早完成七年计划的各种保证。管理局局长古雪夫向我们说，为了提前完成七年计划，莫斯科州今年要大力提高单位面积产量，使每公顷谷物产量达到十八到二十公担、土豆产量达到一百二十五公担，把肉类生产计划完成百分之二百，争取为国家生产肉类十六万吨。我们问古雪夫同志，要完成这项任务中心的问题是什么？他回答说，在最重要的问题中间，目前正在全力以赴的工作是大量积肥和施肥。他说，今年莫斯科州要积肥二千万吨左右，平均每公顷可以有十八吨肥料，这比去年多一倍以上。古雪夫同志还说：“目前莫斯科州所有的区、所有的集体农庄和国营农场都在大搞积肥，因为他们知道，只有大量施肥才能不断提高谷物产量，只有大搞积肥才能收获更多的饲料。因此，可以说积肥在目前是个中心问题。
    取之不尽的肥料库
    莫斯科州的诺金斯克区座落在麦绍尔低地的一端，这个地方的一个特点就是湖沼众多、泥炭丰富。在诺金斯克土壤改良站，我们看到了一幅土壤分类图，地图上布满了各种颜色的圈子。土壤改良站站长雷特科拿着地图向我们解释说，这些圈子标明的都是泥炭分布区。在诺金斯克泥炭的总面积达到一千八百多公顷，总藏量有二千多万立方米，换句话说就是全区用上二、三十年也用不完。
      “泥炭”这两个字看起来好像是专门为工业用的，它可以在火电站或工厂作燃料，在建筑业方面作绝缘体，又可以作化学工业的原料；但是泥炭最大的用途却是在农业方面。用泥炭作肥料在莫斯科州是最为恰当的，因为它蕴藏丰富，任何一个农庄都可以在附近找到；开发便利，不需要大量投资，并且施肥后的效果良好。
    土壤改良站农艺师还告诉我们说，泥炭按照质量来说可以分成三种：这就是上层泥炭、低层泥炭和过渡层泥炭。其中低层泥炭最适于作肥料，因为它包含的腐化质多，含酸量少，并且容易与粪肥、氨水等混合。这种低层泥炭在诺金斯克区的一千八百多公顷泥炭中占一千四百多公顷。
    在冰雪很多的情况下进行积肥和施肥是有些困难的，因为泥炭全埋在很厚的雪堆下面，道路经常被冰雪覆盖。但是诺金斯克区的劳动人民在七年计划的鼓舞下，满怀信心地克服着这些困难，积肥工作目前正以日益增高的速度进行着，仅仅土壤改良站的两个工作队，过去四个月中间就准备好了泥炭肥料六万五千吨。除此以外各集体农庄还发挥了自己的潜力进行运肥。在很多地方都可以看到一乘乘飞驰的雪橇拖着肥料奔向田地，许多地方还用拖拉机拖着大块铁板进行运肥。许多工厂的工人在休息的时间也来参加工作，机关团体的司机也自动报名参加运肥。这种高涨的热情使得莫斯科州今年的积肥工作得到了空前未有的规模。
      积肥工作队的创造
    诺金斯克区的“恰巴耶夫”集体农庄，是一个有着二千多公顷土地的农庄，除去牧场和森林以外，仅只耕地就有八百多公顷。来到这个农庄以后，首先一个感觉便是森林多，空气湿润。农庄庄员告诉我们说，如果夏天来到这里，那真像置身于公园里一样。
    在“恰巴耶夫”集体农庄中间，有一个泥沼地带，这就是泥炭的出产地，土壤改良站有一个积肥工作队就在这里工作。还在离工地两三公里的地方，我们就听到了机器开动的声音。及至来到工地以后，我们看见有二、三十个青年，正在白茫茫的雪地中紧张地工作。车停下来以后，集体农庄主席雅可夫列夫把我们带到了堆积泥炭的地方，他顺手拿起一块泥炭说，这就是他们农庄的“宝贝”。
    农庄主席还告诉我们说，他们今年准备积肥一万七千吨，一般作物平均每公顷可以施肥二十吨左右，但是去年他们进行一项大胆的试验，在一块玉米地上每公顷施肥一百吨，结果收成比平常增加了两倍左右。雅可夫列夫同志说，今年这种试验还要继续，他们决定在四十五公顷玉米地上，每公顷施肥一百五十吨；另外还要在一百二十五公顷土豆地上，每公顷施肥一百吨。这样产量就可以大大提高。为了进行这种试验，所以积肥任务就比往年加大，除去土壤改良站的积肥工作队以外，农庄还动员了所有的雪橇和马匹进行运肥工作。
    积肥工作队了解了农庄的意图以后，也决定大力支持农庄。他们不顾严寒和冰雪，在寒风袭击的情况下，开始了向泥沼进军。一个个掘土机怒吼着，把巨大的掘土斗伸向泥炭的宝库，把成吨的泥炭“抓”了起来，装到卡车上。此外，还有几部推土机，干脆开到泥沼上面，一层层地把煤炭推了起来堆成小山。但是这还不能使工人们满足，因为掘土机装车毕竟还有些慢，并且掘土机也不多。在这种情况下，积肥工作队的工人们集体设计出了一种木制栈桥，把泥炭推上去以后，几分钟就能把十几辆卡车装满。积肥工作队队长斯捷潘诺夫说，有了这种栈桥以后，每天运肥的数量能达到一千二百吨左右，这样这个农庄的积肥任务，不上半月就可以完成。一吨泥炭变成三吨混合肥料
    在莫斯科州的积肥工作中，今年还有个大力推广的新方法，这就是用泥炭作牲畜的垫土。据农业专家说，如果用含水量40％的泥炭作牲畜的垫土，经过七天到十天以后，一吨泥炭就可以变成三吨质量很好的混合肥料。
    这种新方法，在诺金斯克区“五一”集体农庄已经试验了三年，效果良好。但是在今年大规模推广之前，当地一些养牛员、养猪员和挤奶员心里都有些顾虑。他们说，用泥炭作垫土以后，牲畜一定会满身泥泞，把养牛房和养猪房弄得肮脏不堪。当区党委和区苏维埃农业部了解到这种情况以后，就在“五一”农庄召开了一个现场会议，各农庄的养牛员和养猪员都派来代表参加会议，他们参观完了“五一”农庄的养牛房以后，才相信了用泥炭作垫土的好处。
    当我们来到“恰巴耶夫”集体农庄的养牛房时，这里对于用泥炭作垫土早已习以为常了。养牛员告诉我们说，每隔十天就有几辆卡车运着加过工后的泥炭来到养牛房，卸完这些泥炭以后，卡车就把“加工”好的泥炭运到地里去。
    农庄主席雅可夫列夫说，这座有一百二十头牛的养牛房，现在已经变成了农庄的一个肥料厂，每次用来作垫土的泥炭只要五十吨，而十天以后就变成了一百五十吨混合肥料。
    用泥炭作垫土以后，在养牛房里起了什么变化呢？我把这问题提给在养牛房中工作了二十年的老养牛员泽可娃。她说：“第一个变化是养牛房里干净了，因为牛粪、牛尿的气味泥炭全可以吸收进去，第二个变化是养牛房中的温度也有所提高，因为泥炭垫了三、四十公分后，这比垫草更可以挡寒……。”
    农庄主席马上补充说：“第三个变化是牛的患病率减少，第四个变化是养牛房变成了肥料厂。”他又开着玩笑地问泽可娃：“现在你还要垫草吗？”
    泽可娃说：“现在我们的要求是多给我们运些泥炭来，好有个后备。”
    当我们走出养牛房的时候，看到初春的太阳把白雪照得闪耀发光，在平滑的小路上，一乘乘雪橇在飞奔。农庄主席说：“现在农庄中已经在检查种子，检查机器，化雪以后，就要开始七年计划第二年的战斗了。”他说，他们农庄的所有人都满怀信心，一定要在二十世纪六十年代的第一年，把自己规定的任务提前完成。（附图片）
