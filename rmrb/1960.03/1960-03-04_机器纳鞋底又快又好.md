Shoes made with soles stitched by this machine and worn by growing girls for four months will have worn out uppers, but the soles will still be in good condition. The labor cost for hand-stitching the same type of sole is 39.5 fen per pair, while the cost for machine-stitching is only 5.5 li per pair.

    机器纳鞋底又快又好
    据新华社讯　北京第二童鞋生产合作社自制简易纳底机，比手工纳底提高效率四、五十倍到一百倍左右。用这种机器纳的底做成鞋子，给正在成长中的女孩子穿四个月，鞋面破了，鞋底还很好。用手工纳同类型的鞋底，每双须工费三角九分五，用机器每双只合五分五厘。
