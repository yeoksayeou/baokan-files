Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: According to TASS, Moscow: Soviet Premier Khrushchev, in a reply on the 7th to the leaders of Japanese women's organizations, pointed out that the Soviet government has proposed a plan for complete and thorough disarmament and is steadfastly striving for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, first and foremost the prohibition of testing these weapons. However, there are still forces that are trying to obstruct the achievement of a disarmament agreement and advocating the continued pursuit of the outdated "position of strength" policy. Khrushchev pointed out that it is regrettable that the Japanese government has also embarked on this path and signed a new military treaty with the United States.

The leaders of Japanese women's organizations had sent a letter to Khrushchev, calling on the leaders of the Soviet government to promote the realization of complete disarmament and requesting support for their participation in the struggle to abolish the US-Japan "Security Treaty," which threatens world peace.

In his reply, Khrushchev pointed out that continuing to pursue a "position of strength" policy and signing the US-Japan "Security Treaty" cannot but complicate relations between countries, creating a threat to peace, including peace in the Far East. Participating in a military alliance and establishing foreign military bases on one's own territory will seriously undermine the independence of the Japanese nation.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet side has firmly advocated in the past, and will continue to steadfastly advocate in the future, the abolition of military blocs and military bases on foreign territories, and the development of friendship and cooperation between countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.

In his reply, the Soviet Premier agreed with the hope of the Japanese women that the upcoming summit meeting will help conclude an agreement on complete disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: Tokyo news: Approximately 1,800 representatives of women from all walks of life in Japan held a conference in Tokyo today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of "March 8th" International Women's Day. After the meeting, the participants also held a demonstration march.

The resolution passed at the conference stated, "Japanese women who love peace and independence will strengthen their actions against the Diet's ratification of the new 'Security Treaty' and against the government's hostile policy towards China. We will fight to restore diplomatic relations with China."

The resolution emphasized that Japanese women cannot accept the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," even though Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has already signed it.

The two main slogans of the conference were: "Let us work closely with women of all countries to prevent the revision of the 'Security Treaty'" and "Let us work hand in hand with women of all countries to achieve complete disarmament."

Ayata Asano, head of the Japanese Communist Party's Women's Department, and other women's movement leaders emphasized at the meeting that only a peaceful environment can guarantee the happiness of women and children. They called on the participants to redouble their efforts to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new US-Japan "Security Treaty."

Ichikawa Fusae, Yamakawa Kikue, Nosaka Ryu, and others who have long been engaged in the women's movement, pointed out at the meeting that the women's movement in Japan is now gradually becoming a powerful force in Japanese society capable of influencing national policy.

Next, representatives of working women and housewives spoke at the meeting. They unanimously emphasized that without fundamentally changing the political structure of Japan, the complete liberation of women cannot be realized.

Two women representatives from the Soviet Union were invited to attend the conference.

The Soviet women representatives addressed the conference.

When the congratulatory letter from the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China was read at the conference, the participants burst into stormy applause.

The declaration passed at the conference stated that Japanese women are determined to take today's conference as a starting point and fight for Japan to move towards peace and independence.

Women's conferences were also held in Osaka and Hiroshima.

    日美“安全条约”威胁世界和平
    赫鲁晓夫复函日本妇女谴责日美军事同盟
    日本各界妇女集会决心阻止批准日美条约
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫7日在给日本妇女团体领导人的回信中指出，苏联政府提出了全面彻底裁军的建议，并在坚定不移地争取禁止核武器，首先是禁止试验这种武器。但是，目前还有这样一种势力，它们竭力阻挠达成裁军协议，主张继续奉行已经过时的“实力地位”政策。赫鲁晓夫指出，令人遗憾的是，日本政府也走上了这条道路，同美国签订了新的军事条约。
    日本妇女团体领导人曾经给赫鲁晓夫一封信，呼吁苏联政府领导人促进全面裁军的实现，并请求支援她们所参加的取消威胁世界和平的日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫在回信中指出，继续奉行“实力地位”政策、签订美日“安全条约”不能不使国与国之间的关系复杂化，造成对和平，其中包括对远东和平的威胁。参加军事同盟，在本国领土上设立外国的军事基地，将使日本国家的独立受到严重的损害。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联方面过去坚决主张，今后仍然坚定不移地主张取消军事集团和在别国领土上的军事基地，主张发展友谊和各国在和平共处原则基础上的合作。
    苏联部长会议主席在回信中赞同日本妇女的这种希望：即将举行的最高级会议将有助于缔结全面裁军的协议。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本各界妇女代表约一千八百人今天在东京举行大会，纪念“三八”国际妇女节五十周年。会后，与会者还举行了示威游行。
    大会通过的决议说，“热爱和平和独立的日本妇女将加强反对国会批准新‘安全条约’的行动和反对政府敌视中国的政策。我们将为恢复同中国的外交关系而斗争。”
    决议强调说，日本妇女不能接受新日美“安全条约”，即使岸信介首相已经签字。
    这次大会的两个主要口号是：“让我们同各国妇女密切合作来阻止修改‘安全条约’”和“让我们同世界各国妇女携手努力实现彻底裁军”。
    日本共产党妇女部部长艾田朝野等妇女运动领袖在会上强调说，只有和平的环境，才能保证妇女和儿童的幸福。她们号召与会者加倍努力，阻止国会批准新的日美“安全条约”。
    长期从事妇女运动的市川房枝，山川菊荣和野坂龙等在会上指出，日本的妇女运动现在逐渐成为日本社会中足以影响国家政策的强大因素。
    接着，职业妇女和家庭妇女代表在会上讲话。她们一致强调说，如果不根本改变日本的政治结构，妇女的彻底解放是无法实现的。
    苏联的两位妇女代表应邀出席了大会。
    苏联妇女代表曾经向大会致词。
    当大会宣读中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会的贺信时，与会者响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    大会通过宣言表示，日本妇女决心以今天的大会为起点，为使日本走向和平与独立而斗争。
    大阪、广岛也举行了妇女大会。
