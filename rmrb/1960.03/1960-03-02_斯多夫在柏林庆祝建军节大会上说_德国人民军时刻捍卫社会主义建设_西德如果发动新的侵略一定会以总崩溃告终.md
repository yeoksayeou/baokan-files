Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 1st: The Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic, Stoph, said yesterday that the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic has now become a well-equipped and modernized army, capable and constantly prepared to defend the socialist achievements and peace of the German Democratic Republic.

He said that the National Defense Council of the German Democratic Republic, established under the chairmanship of Ulbricht, will strengthen the defense capabilities of the German Democratic Republic, thereby ensuring that the working people can continue to build socialism without interference.

General Stoph made these remarks on the evening of February 29 at a rally held in Berlin to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic. Among those attending the celebration were General Vasiagin, Commander of the Soviet Forces stationed in the German Democratic Republic, military attaches from embassies of various socialist countries, Neumann, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and representatives of the government and armed forces of the German Democratic Republic.

In his speech, Stoph also said that the aggressive policies pursued by the West German government made it necessary for the German Democratic Republic to establish the National People's Army four years ago. Now, West Germany's aggressive policies are being stepped up. And Strauss is in Madrid negotiating the establishment of West German military bases in Spain. According to NATO's plans, West Germany should have twelve divisions, but Strauss has confirmed that West Germany will build twenty-four divisions. Stoph pointed out that the nature of the military exercises conducted by West Germany shows that West Germany is planning a blitzkrieg against the German Democratic Republic. The current responsibility of the German Democratic Republic is to expose the evil plans of the West German militarists to everyone, so as to develop a broad peace front sufficient to prevent such plans from being realized.

Stoph said that it is necessary to make the West German generals realize that their aggressive plans are hopeless. Hitler's total war ended in total collapse. Now, the strength of the socialist camp has been greatly strengthened, which guarantees that any new aggression will also end in total collapse. Stoph said that the Warsaw Treaty member states have clearly stated that they will not allow any attacks on the German Democratic Republic, Poland, or Czechoslovakia. If such an attack occurs, the socialist countries will immediately use all their strength to deal with such an attack.

In his speech, Stoph also emphasized that the German Democratic Republic is making every effort to eliminate the danger of war from West German militarists. However, the Bonn ruling clique is taking every means to intensify the tense situation. Stoph said that the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and a peaceful settlement of the West Berlin issue are the best means of restraining West German militarists and eliminating the danger of war they are creating.

General Vasiagin, Commander of the Soviet Forces stationed in the German Democratic Republic, delivered a congratulatory speech at the celebration.

    斯多夫在柏林庆祝建军节大会上说
    德国人民军时刻捍卫社会主义建设
    西德如果发动新的侵略一定会以总崩溃告终
    新华社柏林1日电　德意志民主共和国国防部长斯多夫昨天说，德意志民主共和国国家人民军现在已经成了装备良好的现代化军队，它有能力而且在时刻准备着捍卫德意志民主共和国的社会主义成就和和平。
    他说，德意志民主共和国所建立的由乌布利希担任主席的国防委员会，将增强德意志民主共和国的国防力量，从而保障劳动人民可以不受干扰地继续建设社会主义。
    斯多夫将军是于2月29日晚上在柏林举行的德意志民主共和国国家人民军建军四周年庆祝大会上讲话时说这番话的。参加这次庆祝会的有驻德意志民主共和国的苏军司令瓦西亚金将军和各社会主义国家大使馆的武官，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员诺伊曼，以及德意志民主共和国政府和武装部队的代表。
    斯多夫在讲话中还说，西德政府奉行的侵略政策使德意志民主共和国在四年前有必要建立国家人民军。现在，西德的侵略政策正在加紧执行。而施特劳斯又在马德里谈判西德在西班牙设立军事基地的问题。根据北大西洋公约组织的计划，西德应有十二个师，可是施特劳斯证实，西德将建立二十四个师。斯多夫指出，西德进行的军事演习的性质表明，西德策划对德意志民主共和国发动闪电袭击。德意志民主共和国当前的责任是向每个人揭露西德军国主义者的罪恶计划，以便发展一个足以阻止这种计划得以实现的广泛的和平阵线。
    斯多夫说，有必要使西德的将军们认识到，他们的侵略计划是没有希望的。当年希特勒的总体战以总崩溃告终，现在社会主义阵营的力量已大大加强，这就保证任何新的侵略也一定会以总崩溃告终。斯多夫说，华沙条约缔约国已明确地声明，它们不允许对德意志民主共和国、波兰或捷克斯洛伐克进行任何袭击。如果发生这种袭击，社会主义国家将立即以全部力量来对付这类袭击。
    斯多夫在讲话中还强调指出，德意志民主共和国尽一切努力来消除来自西德军国主义者的战争危险。然而，波恩统治集团却采取一切办法加剧紧张局势。斯多夫说，迅速缔结对德和约和和平解决西柏林问题，是约制西德军国主义分子和消除他们制造的战争危险的最好手段。
    驻德意志民主共和国苏军司令瓦西亚金将军在庆祝会上致了贺词。
