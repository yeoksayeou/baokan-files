Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 17th: The case of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique has been publicly tried by the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court. Fourteen counter-revolutionary traitors, led by Gong Pinmei, have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from five years to life imprisonment.

The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique case was cracked by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau on September 8, 1955. The court trial confirmed that Gong Pinmei and the other fourteen defendants were core members of a major counter-revolutionary traitorous clique disguised under the cloak of religion, aiming to subvert our people's democratic regime. This counter-revolutionary traitorous clique was organized under the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Vatican. The court's punishment of these counter-revolutionaries is another serious blow to the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to subvert our people's democratic regime.

From March 16th to 17th, the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court held a public trial based on the indictment of the Shanghai People's Procuratorate Branch. More than 500 people from all walks of life in Shanghai attended the hearing.

The fourteen key criminals in this counter-revolutionary traitorous clique were: Gong Pinmei, Jin Luxian, Chen Zemin, Zhang Xibin, Zhu Shude, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Hongsheng, Chen Tianxiang, Cai Zhongxian, Wang Rensheng, Fu Hezhou, Chen Yuntang, Li Shiyu, and Liu Jize. The court, based on the public prosecution by the procuratorial organs, listened to the defendants' statements and the defense of their lawyers, and examined a large number of documents of counter-revolutionary activities, witness testimonies, and materials of accusations and complaints from the people. Finally, the verdict was announced on March 17th.

Abundant and conclusive facts prove that the crimes of this counter-revolutionary traitorous clique were extremely serious. As early as 1948, when the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution was imminent and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek was facing collapse, U.S. imperialism and the Vatican, in order to sabotage the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, sent U.S. imperialist element, Catholic Cardinal Spellman (American citizen), and spy, Harold Rigney (American citizen), to our country to carry out counter-revolutionary "contingency" deployments. Harold Rigney was appointed as the Secretary-General of the reactionary organization "Catholic Central Bureau," directly controlling this reactionary organization and directing counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the Catholic Church to carry out sabotage activities. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to adapt to the changing situation and to continue engaging in criminal activities of subverting our people's democratic regime under the guise of religion, they decided to select a Chinese reactionary cleric to serve as bishop. In August 1950, Gong Pinmei, an imperialist special agent who had always resolutely opposed communism and the people, was appointed as the Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese of the Catholic Church, under the planning of Harold Rigney and imperialist elements Li Peili (former Papal "Envoy" to the Chiang Kai-shek gang, who had been expelled from our country) and others who were previously lurking in the Catholic Church in China, and with the approval of the Vatican. At the same time, the Vatican also sent Jin Luxian, who had received long-term reactionary training, back to Shanghai to collaborate with Gong Pinmei in traitorous activities.

After Gong Pinmei took office as Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese of the Catholic Church, under the personal instructions of U.S. imperialist spy Harold Rigney and imperialist elements Li Peili, Ge Shouping, and Cai Ermeng, he gathered Jin Luxian, Chen Zemin, Zhang Xibin, Zhu Shude, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Hongsheng, Chen Tianxiang, Cai Zhongxian, Wang Rensheng, Fu Hezhou, Chen Yuntang, Hou Zhizheng (deceased due to illness), Li Shiyu, and Liu Jize as the core to form a counter-revolutionary traitorous clique. They used the church institutions under their control to conduct a series of organized and planned traitorous activities.

The Gong Pinmei-led counter-revolutionary traitorous clique, with the active support of U.S. imperialism, frantically carried out various counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. This counter-revolutionary traitorous clique, under the guise of religion, consistently undermined the implementation of national political movements, policies, laws, and decrees; sabotaged the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics throughout the country, and persecuted patriotic Catholics; fabricated and spread rumors, advocated U.S. imperialist aggressive wars, and sabotaged the peace movement; colluded with and harbored imperialist spies, stole state secrets and intelligence; harbored special agents and counter-revolutionary elements; undermined the land reform movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; established counter-revolutionary secret organizations and conducted espionage training; lured young Catholics to flee abroad; and privately hid guns, ammunition, and secret radios, plotting to coordinate with U.S. imperialist aggression and the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, etc., their crimes were extremely serious. For example, this counter-revolutionary traitorous clique had obtained information on the number of troops, equipment, combat supplies, and air defense measures of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, as well as classified information on the design of railway rerouting and the construction of national defense industries in our country. As another example, they also actively supported the counter-revolutionary organization "National Salvation Revolutionary Party," establishing counter-revolutionary strongholds in rural areas near Shanghai, plotting to organize armed riots. When our public security organs cracked this case, they found guns, ammunition, radios, and reactionary flags of the Kuomintang hidden by these counter-revolutionary elements in the churches, seminaries, and schools under their control. This counter-revolutionary traitorous clique also privately set up prisons in the churches to persecute believers. Sister Shu Haiyun was unjustly imprisoned in the jail for as long as ten months.

In the face of abundant and conclusive evidence, the defendants could not deny their crimes. The court pointed out in the verdict that the Gong Pinmei-led counter-revolutionary traitorous clique was an important tool used by imperialism to subvert our people's democratic regime. Under the guise of religion, they colluded with imperialism and betrayed the motherland, constituting serious crimes of treason.

Based on the provisions of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the court imposed the deserved punishment on each criminal according to the specific circumstances of their crimes and their expressions of repentance after being brought to justice. Gong Pinmei was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life. Jin Luxian was sentenced to eighteen years in prison and deprived of political rights for eight years. Chen Zemin, Zhang Xibin, and Zhu Shude were each sentenced to twenty years in prison and deprived of political rights for ten years. Zhu Hongsheng, Chen Tianxiang, Cai Zhongxian, Wang Rensheng, and Fu Hezhou were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison and deprived of political rights for five years. Chen Yuntang was sentenced to twelve years in prison and deprived of political rights for four years. Zhu Xuefan was sentenced to ten years in prison and deprived of political rights for four years. Li Shiyu and Liu Jize were each sentenced to five years in prison.

All guns, ammunition, radios, gold, U.S. dollars, and other items used for the crimes that were seized were confiscated.

The court also announced that the term of imprisonment for each criminal would be calculated from the day of the judgment, and the number of days of detention before the judgment would be deducted from the term of imprisonment, one day for each day.

    对美帝国主义颠覆我国人民民主政权阴谋的又一次严重打击
    龚品梅反革命叛国集团受到国法制裁
    上海中级法院开庭公审，十四名罪犯分别判处有期徒刑和无期徒刑
    新华社上海17日电　以龚品梅为首的反革命叛国集团案件，已由上海市中级人民法院进行了公开审判，以龚品梅为首的十四名反革命叛国分子，分别被判处了五年以上的有期徒刑和无期徒刑。
    龚品梅反革命叛国集团案件是在1955年9月8日被我上海市公安机关破获的。法庭审判的结果证实：龚品梅等十四名被告，是披着宗教外衣旨在颠覆我国人民民主政权的重大反革命叛国集团的核心分子。这个反革命叛国集团是在美帝国主义和罗马教廷阴谋策划下组织起来的。法庭对这些反革命分子给予国法的制裁，是对美帝国主义颠覆我国人民民主政权阴谋的又一次严重打击。
    3月16日到17日，上海市中级人民法院刑事审判庭根据上海市人民检察院分院的起诉，开庭进行公开审判。出席旁听的有上海市各界人士五百多人。
    这个反革命叛国集团的十四名重要案犯是：龚品梅、金鲁贤、陈哲敏、张希斌、朱树德、朱雪帆、朱洪声、陈天祥、蔡忠贤、王仁生、傅鹤洲、陈云棠、李式玉、刘季泽。法庭根据检察机关的公诉，听取了被告的陈述和辩护人的辩护，又审查了大量进行反革命活动的证件，证人的证言、证词和人民群众的检举、控诉材料，最后在3月17日宣布了判决。
    大量确凿的事实证明：这个反革命叛国集团的罪行是极为严重的。早在1948年，当中国人民革命胜利形势即将到来，蒋介石反动统治面临崩溃的时候，美帝国主义和罗马教廷为了破坏中国人民革命事业，派遣美帝国主义分子、天主教枢机主教史贝尔曼（美国籍）和间谍华理柱（美国籍），来我国进行反革命的“应变”部署。华理柱被指派充任反动机构“天主教中央局”的秘书长，直接控制这个反动组织，指挥潜藏在天主教中的反革命分子进行破坏活动。中华人民共和国成立以后，他们为了适应形势的变化，便于继续披着宗教外衣从事颠覆我国人民民主政权的罪恶活动，决定选择一个中国籍的反动神职人员担任主教。1950年8月，帝国主义的特务、一贯坚决反共反人民的龚品梅，在华理柱和原潜藏在中国天主教内的帝国主义分子黎培理（前罗马教廷驻蒋帮“公使”，已被我驱逐出境）等人的策划下，经罗马教廷批准，出任天主教上海教区主教。同时，罗马教廷又将受过长期反动训练的金鲁贤也遣返上海，协同龚品梅进行叛国活动。
    龚品梅出任天主教上海教区主教后，即在美帝国主义间谍华理柱和帝国主义分子黎培理、格寿平、才尔孟的亲自指使下，纠集金鲁贤、陈哲敏、张希斌、朱树德、朱雪帆、朱洪声、陈天祥、蔡忠贤、王仁生、傅鹤洲、陈云棠、侯之正（已病死）、李式玉、刘季泽等为核心，组成反革命叛国集团，利用所控制的教会机构，有组织、有计划地进行了一系列的叛国活动。
    以龚品梅为首的反革命叛国集团，由于得到了美帝国主义的积极支持，他们疯狂地进行各种反革命破坏活动。这个反革命叛国集团，披着宗教外衣，一贯破坏国家各项政治运动和政策、法律、法令的实施；破坏全国各地天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，迫害爱国教徒；制造和散布谣言，鼓吹美帝国主义的侵略战争，破坏和平运动；勾结、包庇帝国主义间谍，窃取国家机密情报；窝藏特务、反革命分子；破坏土地改革运动和镇压反革命运动；建立反革命秘密组织，进行特务训练；诱骗青年教徒逃往国外；私藏枪支、弹药和秘密电台，图谋策应美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石匪帮的复辟，等等，罪行极为严重。例如，这个反革命叛国集团曾经探取了中国人民志愿军在朝鲜部队人数、装备、作战给养和防空措施的情况以及我国铁路改线的设计机密，国防工业的建设等情报。又如他们还积极支持反革命组织“救国革命党”，在上海市附近农村中建立反革命据点，阴谋组织武装暴动。当我公安机关破获这个案件的时候，曾经在他们控制的教堂、修院、学校内搜查出这些反革命分子匿藏的枪支、弹药、电台和国民党的反动旗帜。这个反革命叛国集团还在教堂内私设监牢，迫害教徒，修女舒海云就被无辜囚禁在牢内达十个月之久。
    在大量确凿的罪证面前，被告无法抵赖。法庭在判决书中指出：以龚品梅为首的反革命叛国集团，是帝国主义用以颠覆我国人民民主政权的重要工具，他们披着宗教外衣，勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国，已构成严重的叛国罪行。
    法庭根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例的规定，按照各罪犯的具体情节和到案后的悔罪表现，分别给予他们以应得的惩罚。龚品梅被判处无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身；金鲁贤被判处有期徒刑十八年，剥夺政治权利八年，陈哲敏、张希斌、朱树德各被判处有期徒刑二十年，剥夺政治权利十年；朱洪声、陈天祥、蔡忠贤、王仁生、傅鹤洲各被判处有期徒刑十五年，剥夺政治权利五年；陈云棠被判处有期徒刑十二年，剥夺政治权利四年；朱雪帆被判处有期徒刑十年，剥夺政治权利四年；李式玉、刘季泽各被判处有期徒刑五年。
    查获的各种枪支、弹药、电台、黄金、美钞等为犯罪所用的物件，一律予以没收。
    法庭还宣布，各罪犯的刑期，从判决的一天起算，判决前关押的日数，一日折抵徒刑一日。
