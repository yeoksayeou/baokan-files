Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 22nd - Soviet newspapers "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published articles today, criticizing Adenauer's "Cold War" speech in the United States.

	The observer's article published in "Pravda" pointed out that many of Adenauer's speeches in the United States expressed a desire to maintain the "Cold War" and maintain a state of distrust and strife between countries. It is no accident that he made these warmongering speeches on the eve of the upcoming summit meeting.

	The article said that Adenauer is a true defender of the "Cold War" and does not want to lay down his arms. He has never before so openly declared his negative stance on all agreements regarding the East and West. On the issue of disarmament, Adenauer does not intend to have the Bonn government make any contributions. On the contrary, he is enabling West Germany to continue its arms race and nuclear armament. On the issue of German reunification, Adenauer attempts to use the so-called "principle of self-determination" to create a basis for West Germany's plan to annex the German Democratic Republic. Adenauer opposes the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the elimination of the abnormal situation in West Berlin. He even forgets his own nationality and tries his best to maintain the Western countries' occupation of West Berlin.

	"Izvestia's" commentary pointed out that Adenauer went to the United States to limit the possible achievements of the high-level meeting as soon as possible. His speeches in the United States once again prove that the forces threatening the peace of European countries are actively operating in West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th - "Free Romania" published an article on the 18th, refuting Adenauer's absurd remarks about conducting a "referendum" in West Berlin. The article said that Adenauer's "suggested" "referendum" is a new provocation, aimed at perpetuating the occupation of West Berlin and blocking any path to normalizing the situation in West Berlin. The article said that the right to self-determination means that the people of a country have the right to decide their own destiny. However, this decision cannot be made under the "protection" of foreign countries, nor under the bayonets of military occupiers. The article pointed out that Adenauer's visit to the United States was only to oppose any adjustments to the Berlin issue and the German issue, and to continue to maintain international tension and a policy of strength.

    苏罗报纸发表评论指出
    阿登纳要保持冷战阻挠缓和
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“真理报”和“消息报”今天发表文章，抨击阿登纳在美国发表的“冷战”演说。
    “真理报”发表的观察家文章指出，阿登纳在美国发表的许多讲话都表示要保持“冷战”、保持各国之间的不信任和纷争的局面。他在即将召开政府首脑会议的时候发表这些好战的讲话，并不是偶然的。
    文章说，阿登纳是“冷战”的真正捍卫者，他不想放下武器。过去他从来还没有如此公开地声明过自己对所有关于东西方协议的否定立场。在裁军问题上，阿登纳不打算使波恩政府作出什么贡献，相反，他使西德继续进行军备竞赛和进行核武装。在德国统一的问题上，阿登纳企图用所谓“自决原则”来为西德并吞德意志民主共和国的计划制造根据。阿登纳反对缔结对德和约和消除西柏林的不正常局面，他甚至忘掉了自己的国籍，而在尽力保持西方国家对西柏林的占领权。
    “消息报”的评论指出，阿登纳去美国是为了趁早限制高级会议可能达到的成果。他在美国发表的演说再一次证明了，威胁欧洲各国和平的势力正在西德积极行动。
    据新华社18日讯　“自由罗马尼亚报”在18日发表文章，驳斥阿登纳的所谓在西柏林进行“民意测验”的谰言。文章说，阿登纳“建议”的“民意测验”是新的挑衅，其目的在于使西柏林的占领状态永久化，堵塞任何使西柏林局势正常化的道路。文章说，自决权意味着一个国家的各民族有权利自己决定自己的命运。但是，这种决定不能在外国的“保卫”下进行，也不能在军事占领者的刺刀下进行。文章指出，阿登纳访问美国的目的只是为了反对就柏林问题和德国问题作任何的调整，继续保持国际紧张局势和实力政策。
