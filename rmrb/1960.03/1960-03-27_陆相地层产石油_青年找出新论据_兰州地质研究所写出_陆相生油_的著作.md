    Terrestrial Strata Produce Oil: Young People Find New Arguments
    Lanzhou Geological Research Institute Writes "Terrestrial Oil Generation" Book
    (Our report) A group of young people at the Lanzhou Geological Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of the Party organization, have collectively written a theoretical work on petroleum geology based on a wealth of data provided by oil exploration since the founding of the People’s Republic of China – "The Formation and Distribution Law of Terrestrial Oil and Gas Fields in Northwest China." This specialized book of over 400,000 words on "Terrestrial Oil Generation" puts forward new petroleum geological theories related to "Terrestrial Oil Generation." It has been praised by famous Chinese and Soviet geologists, who believe that its direction is correct and that it has important implications for both production and academic research.
    This scientific achievement comes from production practice, guides production practice, and has been further proven in production practice.
    In the past, most of the oil discovered in the world was produced in ancient marine sedimentary rock formations (marine facies strata). Therefore, the "marine oil generation" theory developed and was perfected. Many scholars in capitalist countries have concluded that ancient continental sedimentary rock formations (terrestrial facies strata) contain very little oil, and some even believe that it is impossible to generate oil, the "reason" being that there is little organic matter deposited in ancient inland basin freshwater lakes that can generate oil. China has a wide distribution of terrestrial facies strata, and they have therefore inferred that "China is an oil-poor country."
    After liberation, petroleum geological departments carried out a large amount of exploration work in the Northwest region and discovered many oil and gas fields. The facts eloquently prove that terrestrial strata can not only generate oil, but also generate a large amount of oil. However, how oil is formed in terrestrial strata and what its distribution laws are, no one has made a comprehensive and systematic research result in the past.
    The young people of the Lanzhou Geological Research Institute systematically sorted out and analyzed the petroleum exploration data of the Northwest region over the years, and thus put forward the theory on the basic geological conditions of terrestrial oil generation.
    At the end of 1958, the Lanzhou Geological Research Institute proposed to compile this book in 1959. However, there were many difficulties: the workload was large, the problem was complex, the time was tight, and the researchers' level was not high. But once the Party organization mobilized the masses, the difficulties were solved. The entire institute organized nearly three hundred people to invest in this work. Some went outside to collect specimens and search for data; some tested specimens, drew maps, and analyzed and sorted data at home. They collected a large number of paleontology and rock specimens in the field and conducted more than 10,000 analysis. The petroleum industry and geological departments vigorously assisted, providing more than 500 geological exploration reports and more than 4,000 maps from the past ten years, providing a wealth of information for writing the book.
    Twenty-three people directly participated in the writing of this book, and their average age was only twenty-five, all of whom were young people who had just left the gates of universities. During the writing process, everyone collectively discussed, divided up writing tasks, and revised together under the leadership of the Party. Some old scientists, seeing that the young people were doing a good job, actively cared for and helped them, and gave a lot of valuable guidance to the writing of the book. Therefore, in only more than half a year, the first draft of this book was born last winter, and after some time, it will be published.

    陆相地层产石油　青年找出新论据
    兰州地质研究所写出“陆相生油”的著作
    本报讯　中国科学院兰州地质研究所一群青年人，在党组织的领导下，根据建国以来石油勘探提供的大量资料，集体编写了一部石油地质的理论著作——“中国西北地区陆相油气田的形成及其分布规律”。这部四十多万字的关于“陆相生油”的专著提出了有关“陆相生油”的石油地质新理论。它得到了中国和苏联著名的地质学家的赞许，认为它的方向对头，在生产上和学术上都有重要作用。
    这项科学成果来自生产实践，又指导了生产实践，并且在生产实践中得到了进一步的证明。
    过去世界上发现的石油，绝大部分产在古代海洋沉积的岩层（海相地层）中。因此“海相生油”的理论发展完善。不少资本主义国家的学者就此认为古内陆沉积岩层（陆相地层）中含油很少，有的甚至认为不可能生成石油，“原因”是古内陆盆地淡水湖泊中可以生成石油的有机物沉积少。我国广泛地分布着陆相地层，他们也就此推论“中国是个贫油国”。
    解放后，石油地质部门在西北地区作了大量勘探工作，发现了许多油气田。事实雄辩地证明了陆相地层中不但能够生成石油，而且能够大量生油。但是，石油在陆相地层中是怎样形成的，它的分布规律又如何，过去没有人作出过全面系统的研究结果。
    兰州地质研究所的青年们，系统地整理分析了西北地区历年来石油勘探的资料，从而提出了关于陆相生油的基本地质条件的理论。
    1958年年底，兰州地质研究所提出要在1959年编写出这部专著。但困难是很多的：工作量大，问题复杂，时间紧，研究者水平又不高。但是党组织一发动群众，困难就迎刃而解了。全室组织了将近三百人投入了这项工作。有的到外边采集标本，搜集资料；有的在家里化验标本，绘制图件，分析整理资料。他们在野外采集到大量古生物，岩石标本，进行了一万多项次的分析。石油工业部门和地质部门大力协助，提供了十年以来的地质勘探报告五百多份，图四千多张，为编写专著提供了丰富的资料。
    直接参加这部专著的编写工作的有二十三人，他们平均年龄只有二十五岁，都是走出高等学校大门不久的青年。编写中，大家在党的领导下集体讨论，分工执笔，共同修改。有些老科学家，看到青年人干得很不差，就积极地关心帮助，给编写专著很多宝贵的指导。因此，只花了半年多的时间，这本著作初稿就在去年冬季诞生，再经过若干时日，就可以出版。
