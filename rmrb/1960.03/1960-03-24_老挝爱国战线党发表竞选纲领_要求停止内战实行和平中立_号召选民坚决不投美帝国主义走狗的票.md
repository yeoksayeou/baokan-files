Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 23rd: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently issued a letter to the people of the whole country on the issue of the Lao general election, putting forward ten major programs for the people's struggle during the election period.

The program of struggle put forward in the letter to the people of the whole country, published in the March 19th "Lao Patriotic News," includes: 1. Immediately stop the civil war and stop the actions of "sweeping" and persecuting the people. The Lao Kingdom side must negotiate with the former Lao combat troops and strictly fulfill the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement. 2. Implement a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality and oppose the interference of U.S. imperialism. Establish good relations with all countries with different political systems based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. 3. Respect the current constitution, support the King, safeguard religion, protect temples, respect the parliamentary system, guarantee the democratic freedoms of the people, and hold general elections on the principles of equality, freedom, universality, directness, and secret ballot. 4. Guarantee the freedom of activity of the Lao Patriotic Front and other political parties; immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong, who has been illegally imprisoned, and other leaders and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front. 5. Establish a coalition government with the participation of representatives from the Lao Patriotic Front, various progressive parties, and all ethnic groups. 6. All ethnic groups in Laos are equal, united, and care for and help each other. 7. Equality between men and women. 8. Restore the original value of the Lao currency, refuse military "aid," build the national economy, and strive for unconditional aid from various countries. 9. Improve the lives of people of all ethnic groups and strata, gradually abolish the Tusi system, reduce burdens, abolish unreasonable taxes and levies, oppose forced labor, and supply the people with salt, cloth, and production tools. 10. Develop national education and culture, and develop health, epidemic prevention, and healthcare work.

The letter to the people of the whole country outlines the severity of the current national crisis in Laos. It points out that under the brutal interference of U.S. imperialism, the Lao reactionaries launched a civil war, illegally arrested Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Patriotic Front, and then carried out large-scale "sweeps" and persecution of the people. They also arbitrarily tampered with the election law, attempting to establish a puppet National Assembly that cannot represent the interests of the nation and the people, in order to realize the U.S. conspiracy to turn Laos into its colony and war base.

The letter to the people of the whole country points out that under this situation, it is more important than ever for all the people of Laos to unite and struggle. The letter to the people of the whole country finally calls on all the people of Laos, regardless of gender, to vote in the general election for representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Peaceful Neutrality Committee, and other people who love the motherland and love peace, and resolutely not to vote for the running dogs of U.S. imperialism.

    老挝爱国战线党发表竞选纲领
    要求停止内战实行和平中立
    号召选民坚决不投美帝国主义走狗的票
    新华社河内23日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近就老挝大选问题发表了告全国人民书，提出竞选时期全民斗争的十大纲领。
    这篇刊载在3月19日“老挝爱国新闻”上的告全国人民书提出的斗争纲领包括：一、立即停止内战，停止“扫荡”和迫害人民的行动。老挝王国方面必须同前寮国战斗部队进行谈判，严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议。二、执行真正的和平中立政策，反对美帝国主义的干涉。根据和平共处五项原则同政治制度不同的所有国家建立良好关系。三、尊重现行宪法，支持国王，维护宗教，保护寺庙，尊重代议制度，保证人民的民主自由，在平等、自由、普遍和直接、秘密投票的原则上举行大选。四、保证老挝爱国战线党和其他政党的自由活动；立即恢复被非法监禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人和干部的自由。五、成立由老挝爱国战线党、各进步党派和各民族的代表参加的联合政府。六、老挝各民族平等、团结，互相爱护、互相帮助。七、男女平等。八、恢复老挝币的原有币值，不接受军事“援助”，建设国家经济，争取各国不附带条件的援助。九、改善各民族、各阶层人民的生活，逐渐废除土司制度，减轻负担，撤消不合理的苛捐杂税，反对拉夫抓丁，给人民供应食盐、布匹和生产工具。十、发展民族教育和文化，发展卫生、防疫和保健工作。
    告全国人民书概述了老挝当前民族危机的深重。它指出，在美帝国主义横暴干涉下，老挝反动派发动内战、非法逮捕苏发努冯亲王等爱国战线党领袖之后，又大肆“扫荡”、迫害人民，并擅自篡改选举法，企图成立一个不能代表民族和人民利益的傀儡国民议会，来实现美国把老挝变成它的殖民地和战争基地的阴谋。
    告全国人民书指出，在这种局面下，老挝全民团结起来进行斗争已比过去任何时期更加紧要。告全国人民书最后号召全体老挝人民不分男女，在大选中投票选举老挝爱国战线党、和平中立委员会的代表以及爱祖国、爱和平的其他人士，坚决不投美帝国主义的走狗的票。
