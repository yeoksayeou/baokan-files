Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently issued a statement condemning US imperialism and its lackeys, the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," for orchestrating an election under bayonets in Laos. It demanded the immediate restoration of freedom to Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Patriotic Front, an immediate end to the civil war, the restoration of the power of the National Assembly, and the holding of a general election in accordance with the constitution and the original election law.

The statement, published in the "Lao Patriotic News" on February 28th, pointed out that US imperialism and the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" launched a military coup, dissolved the National Assembly, cancelled its powers, and illegally formed a provisional government, further complicating the already complex situation in Laos. Currently, they are arranging a general election in a fascist manner. They have abolished the election law passed by the Lao National Assembly in March 1957 and arbitrarily formulated a new election law that violates the constitution, with the aim of abolishing the people's democratic and free rights and excluding Lao people who love their country and peace from the National Assembly. The statement said that this is a very reactionary act that violates the kingdom's constitution and is also a continuing act of sabotage against the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements.

The statement then severely condemned the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" for intensifying "sweeps," persecuting and massacring the people, and preventing Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front from participating in the election as the election approached.

The statement pointed out that the election conducted under these circumstances is nothing more than a new conspiracy to establish a dictatorial warlord system in Laos, undermine peace, prolong the civil war, undermine the people's democratic freedoms and peaceful life, and turn Laos into a new colony and military base of US imperialism.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front, which pursues a policy of peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and national harmony, and respects the constitution, declares: (1) It strongly opposes the illegal amendment of the election law. (2) It demands the restoration of the power of the National Assembly and demands that members of the National Assembly be convened to discuss and decide on the general election so that the general election can be conducted in accordance with the constitution and the original election law. (3) It demands the immediate restoration of freedom to Prince Souphanouvong and other members and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front who are being illegally imprisoned, so that they can participate in the general election in a timely manner.

(4) It demands that the Kingdom's government stop the civil war, stop the "sweeps" and persecution of the people, in order to restore the normal situation in Laos. To this end, both sides must meet immediately for consultations and negotiations. The statement said that only by realizing the above four points can the necessary conditions be created for a democratic and free election. The statement finally called on the Lao people, regardless of class, race, religion, or political party, to unite more closely and resolutely fight against the amendment of the election law and demand a truly democratic and free election.

    老挝爱国战线党中央发表声明
    反对美国在老挝制造刺刀下的大选
    按照法西斯方式布置的大选是破坏日内瓦协议的行为
    新华社河内3日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近发表声明，谴责美帝国主义及其走狗老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”在老挝制造刺刀下的大选，并且要求立即恢复苏发努冯亲王等爱国战线党领导人的自由，立即停止内战，恢复国会的权力，根据宪法和原选举法的规定进行大选。
    发表在2月28日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”上的这篇声明指出，美帝国主义和老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们发动军事政变，解散国会，取消国会的权力，并非法成立临时政府，使已经复杂的老挝局势更加复杂化。目前，它们正在按照法西斯方式布置大选，它们取消了老挝国会1957年3月通过的选举法，擅自制订违反宪法的新选举法，目的在于取消人民的民主、自由权利，把爱祖国、爱和平的老挝人排除出国会之外。声明说，这是一种非常反动的行为，违反了王国的宪法，同时也是继续破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。
    声明接着严厉地谴责了“保卫国家利益委员会”头目们在大选临近时加紧“扫荡”。迫害和屠杀人民并且阻挠苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人参加竞选。
    声明指出，在这种情况下所进行的大选不过是在老挝建立独裁军阀制度、破坏和平、拖延内战、破坏人民的民主自由权和安宁生活，把老挝变成美帝国主义新的殖民地和军事基地的新阴谋而已。
    声明说，奉行和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和民族和睦政策，并尊重宪法的老挝爱国战线党宣布：（一）强烈反对对选举法的非法修改。（二）要求恢复国会的权力，要求召集国会议员来讨论和决定大选问题，使大选能根据宪法和原选举法的规定进行。（三）立即恢复正被非法监禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他议员和干部的自由，让他们能及时参加大选。
  （四）要求王国政府停止内战，停止“扫荡”和迫害人民的行动，以恢复老挝的正常局势。为此，双方必须立即会晤，以便进行协商谈判。声明说，只有实现上述四点，才能为民主、自由的大选创造必要的条件。声明最后号召老挝人民不分阶级、种族、宗教和政党，更加紧密地团结起来，为反对对选举法的修改、要求进行真正民主和自由的大选而坚决斗争。
