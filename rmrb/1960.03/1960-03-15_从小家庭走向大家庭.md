    A Symposium on "A Myriad of Purples and Reds Always Herald Spring"
    From Small Family to Big Family
    Tan Jingying, Director of Sichuanying Nursery, Xuanwu District, Beijing

    People often say, "Today's theater is not a theater, but a classroom," and it's so true. The other day I went to see "A Myriad of Purples and Reds Always Herald Spring," and it immediately resonated with my own life. Although the film is about women in Shanghai, many of the situations are the same as what I have personally experienced and seen.

    Take myself as an example. A housewife who, in the old society, couldn't even find her way out the door, today I am participating in socialist construction, shouldering the task of nurturing the next generation, and have gloriously joined the Communist Party. I have only done a little work, but I have received many rewards and honors. I deeply realize that women can only move from the family to society and achieve complete liberation under the superior socialist system, and only the Party cares for us women so meticulously. In the film, when Gui Zhen receives her first salary, she buys a portrait of Chairman Mao and respectfully hangs it in the workshop. This truly expresses the gratitude of us women, who have begun to achieve complete liberation, to the Party and Chairman Mao.

    I think the film very clearly illustrates from various angles that women can only truly and completely achieve liberation by breaking away from the small circle of household chores, going to society, and participating in collective labor and production. You see, isn't the film about Shanghai in the great leap forward of 1958? But Gui Zhen is still subordinate to her husband. No matter how carefully she serves him, she cannot get equal treatment. She has no freedom to attend meetings or study. Her husband looks down on her, and she feels that she is a waste, uncultured and weak, and unable to do anything. However, under the education of the Party and with the help of her sisters in the neighborhood, she understands the relationship between socialist construction and herself, and she also wants to contribute her strength. She bravely steps out, and wages a struggle against her husband's backward thinking and her own weakness. She takes up a production post and starts a new life, becoming a shrewd and capable production expert. Her family status has also changed, and she is no longer a doormat. Her husband also respects and loves her, the family life is happier, and the country has one more useful talent. Under the education of the Party and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, the social atmosphere has changed, and people are not only concerned about their own families, but also about the collective. As their ideological awareness improves and their minds broaden, they all live healthier and happier lives, and deeply feel the warmth of the socialist big family.

    This film allows us to see more clearly the direction of our efforts. I also realize even more that the childcare work I do creates conditions for the sisters in the neighborhood to participate in production. The mothers have entrusted us with their precious children, so we must do our best to take care of and educate the children, so that the mothers can produce with more peace of mind and more vigor. Childcare work is both arduous and great. It is an important task to cultivate successors with healthy bodies and to cultivate a new generation of socialists with noble character. The Party has entrusted us with this task, which is a sign of its trust in us. I must work harder to do this work well and live up to the Party's cultivation and education of me.

    笔谈“万紫千红总是春”
    从小家庭走向大家庭
    北京市宣武区四川营托儿所所长　谭静英
    人常说，“今天的剧场不是剧场，是课堂”，真是这样。那天我去看“万紫千红总是春”，一看就联系起自己来了。虽然片子里写的是上海妇女，可许多情况都是和自己亲身经历，亲眼见过的一样。
    拿我自己来说吧，一个家庭妇女，在旧社会出门都摸不着方向，今天我也参加了社会主义建设，担负起培养下一代的工作，光荣地加入了共产党；仅仅做了一点工作，却得到许多奖励和荣誉。我深深体会到：妇女们只有在社会主义这个优越制度下，才能从家庭走到社会，得到彻底的解放，也只有党才这样无微不至地关怀我们妇女。影片中桂贞第一次领了工资，就买张毛主席画像，恭敬地挂在车间。这真正表达了我们开始得到彻底解放的妇女感谢党和毛主席的心意。
    我觉得影片很鲜明地从各个角度说明了妇女只有摆脱了家务劳动的小圈子，走到社会，参加集体的劳动生产，才能真正彻底地获得解放。你看，影片中写的不是1958年大跃进声中上海的事吗？可是桂贞却依然从属于他的丈夫，即使小心伺候得再好，也是得不到平等待遇的，开会、学习，哪一点也不自由。丈夫瞧不起她，她自己也觉得自己是个废物，没文化，没气力的，干得了什么呢？然而在党的教育下、街道姐妹们的帮助下，她懂得了建设社会主义与自己的关系，她也要求出一份力量。她勇敢地走出来了，对丈夫的落后思想和自己的软弱展开了斗争。她走上了生产岗位，开始了新的生活，成了精明能干的生产能手，家庭地位也改变了，再不是受气包。丈夫也敬爱她了，家庭生活也过得更幸福了，国家也多了一个有用的人材。在党的教育下，在大跃进的鼓舞下，社会风气变了，人们不仅是关心一家，而是关心集体。她们一个个由于思想觉悟的提高，心胸的开朗，都生活得越来越健康越愉快，深深体会到了社会主义大家庭的温暖。
    这部影片让我们更清楚地看到了自己努力的方向。我也更加认识到自己所做的保育工作，它为街道姐妹们参加生产创造了条件。妈妈们把孩子这块心上的肉交给我们了，我们就得尽量把孩子照顾好、教育好，使妈妈们生产得更安心、更有劲。托儿工作又艰巨又伟大，是培养有健壮身体的接班人，培养有高尚品德的社会主义的新的一代的重要工作。党交给我们这一任务，是对我们的信任。我一定要更努力地做好这一工作，不辜负党对我的培养教育。
