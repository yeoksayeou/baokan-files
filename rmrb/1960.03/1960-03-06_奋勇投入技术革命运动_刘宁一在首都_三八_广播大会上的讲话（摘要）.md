    Plunge Courageously into the Technical Revolution Movement
    Excerpts from Liu Ningyi's Speech at the Capital's "March 8th" Broadcast Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th – Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a speech at the broadcast meeting "Celebrating Achievements and Commending Models to Welcome 'March 8th,' Holding High the Red Flag and Advancing Together." The following are excerpts:

    The great 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is approaching. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I would like to express my heartfelt respect and warmest congratulations to you – the ten thousand "March 8th" Red Banner Bearers, "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives, and sisters across the country who are working hard and forging ahead to achieve continued great leaps forward in 1960.

    Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the broad masses of women of all ethnic groups in our country have not only long been freed from the enslavement and oppression they suffered for thousands of years, becoming masters of the country and society, but have also enabled tens of thousands of women to participate in the country's political life and economic construction. Now, with the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially due to the emergence and increasing consolidation of the people's communes, and the comprehensive organization of the people's economic life in cities, more and more women are freeing themselves from trivial housework and throwing themselves into social collective labor, enabling Chinese women to enter a new stage of completely liberating themselves.

    On all production fronts, the broad masses of female workers in our country, together with male workers, are full of vigor and high spirits, displaying a high degree of communist style, launching a vigorous socialist competition to compare with, catch up with, learn from, and help the advanced, and are making more and more contributions to our country's socialist construction.

    Comrades, sisters, the situation is infinitely good, our victory is great, and our future is infinitely bright. Now, the glorious task before us is to make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, and strive for continued leaps forward this year and sustained leaps forward in the 1960s, together with all male workers and the people of the whole country, to promote the socialist construction of our country more quickly.

    In order to achieve this goal, all women comrades, especially all female workers, must quickly plunge into the vigorous nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. We must further emancipate our minds, break down superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, diligently study, and boldly create. Since the broad masses of female workers have become great warriors of socialist construction, they should rely entirely on the strength and wisdom of the collective to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of all manual labor. We should have the courage, confidence, and perseverance to overcome any cutting-edge scientific and technological challenges.

    We must not only engage in the technical revolution on a large scale, but also engage in the cultural revolution on a large scale. All female workers must strive to learn culture and technology, and strive to become new communist people with both high political consciousness and high scientific culture in a short period of time. Female comrades on the cultural, educational, and scientific fronts in our country should continue to advance along the path of being both red and expert, better integrate with production, better go deep among the masses, and should have ambitious aspirations to climb to the peak of science and culture more quickly.

    All female workers and all family members of workers should enthusiastically participate in organizing urban economic life, actively participate in street production, run various collective welfare undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings, especially participate in the work of resident service stations. Only in this way can a wider range of women be liberated from housework and devote themselves to the cause of socialist construction, and further transform the old cities and build new socialist cities.

    Comrades, sisters, to complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party, the most fundamental guarantee is to listen to the Party's words and listen to Chairman Mao's words. Deeply study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, arm yourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and truly become female warriors of the great Mao Zedong era. On the occasion of commemorating the great 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead bravely.

    奋勇投入技术革命运动
    刘宁一在首都“三八”广播大会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社5日讯　全国总工会主席刘宁一在“庆功表模迎‘三八’、高举红旗齐跃进”广播大会上的讲话，摘要如下：
    伟大的“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年纪念日就要到了，我代表中华全国总工会向您们——万个“三八”红旗手、“三八”红旗集体和全国快马加鞭为实现1960年继续大跃进而勇往前进的姊妹们表示衷心敬意，致以最热烈的祝贺。
    我国各族广大妇女，在党和毛泽东同志领导下，不仅早已摆脱了千百年来所受到的奴役和压迫，成为国家和社会的主人。使成千上万的妇女参加了国家的政治生活和经济建设，现在随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，特别是由于人民公社的出现和日益巩固，以及在城市中全面组织了人民经济生活，愈来愈多的妇女正在摆脱家务琐事，投身于社会集体劳动，使我国妇女进入了彻底解放自己的新阶段。
    在各个生产战线上，我国广大女职工更是和男职工一起，人人干劲冲天，个个精神焕发，发扬了高度的共产主义风格，开展了轰轰烈烈的比先进，赶先进，学先进，帮后进的社会主义竞赛，正在为我国社会主义建设事业作出愈来愈多的贡献。
    同志们，姊妹们，形势无限好，我们的胜利是伟大的，我们的前途无限光明。现在，摆在我们面前的光荣任务，就是要再接再厉，乘胜前进。您们一定要和全体男职工一起，和全国人民一起，把我国社会主义建设事业更快地向前推进，争取今年继续跃进，争取六十年代的持续跃进。
    为了达到这样的目的，全体妇女同志们，尤其是全体女职工，必须迅速地投入到轰轰烈烈的全民性的以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中去。我们一定要进一步解放思想，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢做，刻苦钻研，大胆创造。广大女职工既然已成为社会主义建设的伟大战士，就完全应当依靠集体的力量和智慧，使一切手工劳动实现机械化半机械化。我们应当有胆量，有信心，有毅力去攻克任何科学技术的尖端。
    我们不但要大搞技术革命，还一定要大搞文化革命。全体女职工一定要努力学习文化和技术，力争使自己在短期中成为既有高度政治觉悟，又有高度科学文化的共产主义新人。我国文化、教育和科学战线上的女同志，更应当沿着又红又专的道路继续前进，更好地与生产紧密联系，更好地深入群众，并且应当有雄心大志去更快地攀上科学和文化高峰。
    全体女职工，全体职工家属，应当满腔热忱地去参加组织城市经济生活，踊跃地参加街道生产，举办各种集体福利事业和文教事业，特别是要参加居民服务站的工作。只有这样，才能使更广大的妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，投身于社会主义建设事业，并且进一步改造旧城市，建设社会主义新城市。
    同志们，姊妹们，要完成党给我们的光荣任务，最根本的保证，就是要听党的话，听毛主席的话。深入学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，使您们真正成为伟大毛泽东时代的女战士。在纪念伟大的“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年纪念的时候，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，奋勇前进。
