    In Long-Day Schools

    Recently, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers decided that, in addition to developing a network of boarding schools, they would also universally establish long-day schools for children and teenagers in both urban and rural areas starting from September 1st this year. In these schools, children can receive all-day care and eat two meals. Parents who send their children to these schools can focus on production with peace of mind. This way, children don't have to rush home after class; they can prepare their homework, play games, play with toys, participate in labor, or engage in activities beneficial to their physical and mental well-being under the supervision of teachers. First and second graders, as well as some children with weaker constitutions, can also enjoy a comfortable nap.

    The expenses of long-day schools are covered by the state, and the children's meal expenses are borne by the parents. The city and district Soviet executive committees can exempt 25 percent of the students from part or all of their meal expenses.

    In the past year or two, some ordinary schools have already implemented this long-day schooling system. Experience has shown that these long-day schools not only allow parents to focus more on their work, but also provide children with better education and care.

    Moscow No. 33 School is one such long-day school. (Attached picture)

    在长日制学校里
    不久前，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定，除了发展寄宿学校网以外，从今年9月1日起还要为城乡儿童和少年普遍建立长日制学校。在这些学校里，孩子们可以受到整日的照顾，吃两顿饭。把孩子送到这些学校的父母，可以安心地从事生产。这样，孩子们在下课以后用不着匆匆忙忙地赶回家去，他们可以在教师的照顾下在学校里准备功课，作游戏，玩玩具，参加劳动，或者作一些有益于身心的活动。一年级和二年级的学生以及一些体质弱的儿童还可以得到安适的日睡。
    长日制学校的经费由国家来开支，孩子们的伙食费由父母来负担。市和区苏维埃执委会可以免收百分之二十五的学生的部分或全部的伙食费。
    最近一、二年来，有一些普通学校早已推行这种长日制的教学制度。经验证明，这种长日制学校不仅使父母们可以把自己的注意力更多地放在工作上，而且也使孩子们受到更好的教育和照顾。
    莫斯科第三十三学校就是一个长日制学校。（附图片）
