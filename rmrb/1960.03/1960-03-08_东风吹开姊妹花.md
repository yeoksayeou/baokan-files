    The East Wind Blows Open Sister Flowers
    Driver Sister-in-law
    In the past, I drank and drove a donkey to grind,
    Now, an iron horse sings to me,
    Don't think I'm usually soft-spoken,
    When I move my hands, the car shivers,
    Red bricks and seedlings piled high,
    Load them up! Drive.
    My bellyband was embroidered with a hundred lotuses,
    My apron was embroidered with wisteria,
    Now I want to embroider my hometown's land,
    Let my wheels roll quickly,
    Towing an invisible colorful thread,
    Coming and going like a silver shuttle.
    A thousand-mile horse carries a thousand-mile man,
    I'm happy, and the car is happy too,
    In that day and night vibrating cylinder,
    Beating with the pulse of the Great Leap Forward.
    Follow the road pointed out by the Party,
    My car won't go off track!

    东风吹开姊妹花
    司机大嫂
    过去?喝毛驴拉磨，
    如今铁马给我唱歌，
    别看我平时面软哪，
    我一动手汽车就哆嗦，
    红砖，树苗堆成垛，
    装好喽！开车。
    兜肚上绣过百荷，
    围裙上绣过藤萝，
    如今要绣绣家乡的土地，
    快让我的车轮滚过，
    牵一条无形的彩线，
    来来往往像一支银梭。
    千里人跨上千里马，
    我快活汽车也快活，
    那日夜振荡的汽缸里，
    跳动着大跃进的脉搏。
    按党指出的道路走啊，
    我的车不会出辙！
