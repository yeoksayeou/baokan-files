Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the comrades participating in the Second National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Third Members' Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, with boundless excitement and utmost gratitude, on behalf of industrialists and businessmen and their families nationwide, extend to you our highest and most sincere respect!

For the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and yourself, our great motherland has undergone earth-shattering changes and achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Through the public-private partnership of the entire industry, the socio-economic status of us industrialists and businessmen has undergone fundamental changes; through the anti-rightist rectification movement and participation in labor practice, we have also made progress in our political thinking to varying degrees. In the process of our accepting socialist transformation, the Party and you have given us meticulous care and attention, giving timely encouragement and praise for our slightest progress and achievements; patiently persuading and educating us about our vacillations and concerns, and waiting patiently; giving us stern teachings and sincere help for our mistakes and shortcomings, so that we can continuously improve our understanding, increase our confidence, break with capitalism and establish socialism, and continue to move forward. Respected Chairman Mao, the Party and you cherish us like parents, educate us like teachers, and we really have no appropriate words to express our gratitude and love for the Party and you.

In this congress of our two associations, several leading comrades of the Party Central Committee gave us important reports and instructions, which gave us another extremely profound socialist education. We cheered for the bright and boundless socialist and communist future of our great motherland. We are fortunate to be able to enjoy the increasingly better life of socialism and communism with the people of the whole country. We are proud to live in the Mao Zedong era. However, in the face of such a great situation, thinking of the Party and your teachings and care for us, we really feel ashamed and uneasy. Because some progress we have made in self-transformation and some achievements we have made in participating in socialist construction are really too little and not enough when measured against the requirements of the motherland's leaping development situation and compared with the soaring revolutionary vigor of the broad masses of working people. Through this conference, we must resolutely respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the glorious illumination of the general line, raise our consciousness, exert our energy, actively participate in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, and do our best to make more contributions to the motherland's magnificent socialist construction cause; unremittingly carry out the fundamental transformation of political stand and thinking, and gradually transition to glorious laborers.

Respected Chairman Mao! We assure you: We will never let down the Party and your teachings to us; we will never let down the expectations of the people of the whole country. We must wholeheartedly listen to your words, wholeheartedly follow the Party, wholeheartedly accept transformation, and wholeheartedly serve socialism, and work with the people of the whole country to strive forward to build our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology.

We wish you evergreen and longevity!

    民建和工商联代表大会向毛主席致敬
    一心一意听毛主席的话　一心一意跟着党走
    一心一意接受改造　一心一意为社会主义服务敬爱的毛主席：
    我们参加中国民主建国会第二次全国代表大会和中华全国工商业联合会第三届会员代表大会的全体同志，怀着无比兴奋，万分感激的心情，代表全国工商业者和工商业者家属，谨向您致最崇高、最诚挚的敬意！
    十年来，在中国共产党和您的英明领导下，我们伟大的祖国已经起了翻天复地的巨大变化，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。通过全行业公私合营，我们工商业者的社会经济地位发生了根本的改变；通过反右整风运动，参加劳动实践，我们在政治思想上也得到了不同程度的进步。在我们接受社会主义改造的过程中，党和您给予我们无微不至的关怀和照顾，对于我们点滴的进步和成绩，给予及时的鼓励和表扬；对于我们的动摇和顾虑，不厌其烦地进行说服教育，并且耐心地等待；对于我们的错误和缺点，给予严正的教导和恳切的帮助，使我们能够不断地提高认识，增加信心，破资立社，继续前进。敬爱的毛主席，党和您像父母一样地爱护我们，像师长一样地教育我们，我们实在没有适当的语言可以用来表达我们对党和您的感激和爱戴的心情。
    在这次我们两会代表大会中，党中央几位领导同志给我们做了重要的报告和指示，使我们又一次受到了极为深刻的社会主义教育。我们为伟大祖国的光芒万丈的社会主义、共产主义前途而欢呼。我们为自己能够和全国人民一道享受社会主义、共产主义一天比一天美好的生活而庆幸。我们为生活在毛泽东时代而自豪。但是，面对这样伟大的形势，想到党和您对我们的教导和关怀，我们实在感到惭愧，感到不安。因为，我们在自我改造方面所取得的一些进步，在参加社会主义建设工作中所做出的一些成绩，以祖国飞跃发展形势的要求来衡量，同广大劳动人民冲天的革命干劲相比较，我们实在做得太少，太不够了。通过这次大会，我们一定要坚决响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，在总路线的光辉照耀下，提高自觉，鼓足干劲，积极投入大跃进的行列，尽心竭力地为祖国宏伟的社会主义建设事业作出更多的贡献；坚持不懈地进行政治立场和思想的根本改造，逐步向光荣的劳动者过渡。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们向您保证：我们决不辜负党和您对我们的教导；决不辜负全国人民对我们的期望。我们一定要一心一意听您的话，一心一意跟着党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务，同全国人民一道，为把我们祖国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家而奋勇前进。
    敬祝您松柏长春！万寿无疆！
              中国民主建国会第二次全国代表大会
            中华全国工商业联合会第三届会员代表大会
                                    一九六○年二月二十一日
