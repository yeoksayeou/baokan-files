    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th—The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement tonight condemning the West German government's crude interference in Guinea's establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic.

    The statement pointed out that the West German government, using the pretext that the Republic of Guinea and the German Democratic Republic had established diplomatic relations, threatened to sever relations with the Republic of Guinea. This threatening action by the West German government is not only a provocation against Guinea but also against other Asian and African countries. It proves its unwillingness to respect the independence and right to self-determination of other countries and is a crude interference in their internal affairs.

    The statement said that this fact increasingly proves that the West German government not only refuses to engage in international peaceful cooperation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence but also refuses to support any measures aimed at easing international tensions and promoting a peaceful solution to the German national question. This action by the Bonn government is one of the links in its measures to oppose the easing of international tensions and open the road to war. This proves the neo-colonialist ambitions of the West German government, exposing the hypocrisy of its so-called willingness to "aid" other countries without attaching political conditions. The statement emphasized that the German Democratic Republic recognizes the sovereignty of every country and considers it natural for any country to establish relations with other countries. The German Democratic Republic does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or their foreign affairs.

    The statement severely condemned West Germany's racially inflammatory propaganda against the Republic of Guinea. This inflammatory propaganda is not only directed against the leaders of Guinea but also against all African people. This shows that there are some people in West Germany who have not broken with the old imperialist colonial policies.

    The statement concluded by saying that the West German government's attempts to intimidate nationally independent countries and obstruct them from establishing diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic are doomed to failure. The further development of relations between the German Democratic Republic and other countries is unstoppable.

    德意志民主共和国政府发表声明
    西德阻挠几德建交不会得逞
    波恩粗暴干涉几内亚内政暴露了西德殖民主义面目
    新华社柏林10日电　德意志民主共和国政府今晚发表声明，谴责西德政府粗暴干涉几内亚同德意志民主共和国建交。
    声明指出，西德政府借口几内亚共和国和德意志民主共和国建立了外交关系而威胁要同几内亚共和国断绝关系，西德政府这种威胁行动不只是对几内亚，而且也是对其他亚非国家的挑衅，这证明它不愿意尊重其他国家的独立和自决权，这是对它们的内政的粗暴的干涉。
    声明说，这一事实越来越清楚地证明，西德政府不但拒绝在和平共处原则的基础上进行国际和平合作，而且拒绝支持目的在于导致国际局势缓和和促使德国的民族问题的和平解决的任何措施。波恩政府这种行动是它的反对国际局势缓和和打开战争道路的措施的环节之一。这证明了西德政府的新殖民主义的企图，暴露了它所谓愿意不附加政治条件“援助”其他国家的说法的虚伪性。声明强调说，德意志民主共和国承认每一个国家的主权，认为任何一个国家同其他国家建立关系是理所当然的。德意志民主共和国不干涉其他国家的内政和它们间的外交往来。
    声明严厉谴责西德对几内亚共和国所做的种族煽动的宣传。这种煽动宣传不只是针对几内亚的领导人，也是针对所有非洲人民。这表明，在西德有一些人士没有同旧的帝国主义殖民政策断绝关系。
    声明最后说，西德政府对民族独立国家进行恫吓，阻挠它们同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系，这种企图不会有成功的希望。德意志民主共和国和其他国家的关系的进一步发展是不可阻挡的。
