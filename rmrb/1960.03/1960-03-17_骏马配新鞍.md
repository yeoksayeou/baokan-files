    A Fine Horse Needs a Good Saddle
    Zhou Youhe, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Changjiang People's Commune, Jiangning, Jiangsu

    Our Changjiang People's Commune, this rich land, is striding forward towards agricultural mechanization. Ten years ago, in the dark old society, there wasn't a piece of steel or a single machine here. But look now! Standing on high ground, you can see tractors in groups on that square piece of land, like a majestic tank group, drivers singing heartily, galloping heroically across large tracts of land. Gleaming five-furrow plows and three-furrow plows immediately roll up waves of mud, turning up a foot deep of fertile soil. Disc harrows and spring-tooth harrows, like large iron combs, comb the oily black clumps of soil into fine, loose soil. White mechanized irrigation stations, with three-pipe water pumps, point diagonally at the clear sky. Giant dragon-like columns of water, spewing white foam, draw water from the river to the rice paddies. On the threshing floor, a huge automatic thresher opens its big mouth, consuming piles of rice bundles like small mountains at a rate of 2,500 jin per hour. Standing by the river, looking out at the transportation teams coming and going like long snakes swimming in the water. Power lines are strung across the clear sky, and electric lights illuminate the night with golden light. The machine factory has become the heart of the commune's production power. All this, thousands of things, big and small, are great victories of the three red flags.

    Before the establishment of the commune, the state-established land tilling team had already attracted a large number of commune members, and mechanization became the most urgent requirement and desire in the minds of 38,000 people. The branch secretary of the Yingfang Brigade, in order to use mechanized irrigation and drainage, did not know how many times he walked along the Jing'an River. In the autumn of 1958, the birth of the commune became the starting point for vigorously developing agricultural machinery. Thirty thousand people took shovels, rakes, carrying poles, and hoes, pushing production targets to a peak. The sound of thunderous horns inspired people's enthusiasm even more; the momentum of developing machinery was vast and boundless, everyone was high-spirited and full of energy. After the machinery arrived, people became more confident and encouraged their fighting spirit. Old Zhang, a commune member of the Linjiang Brigade, plowed deeply with a plow, happily saying to the ox:
  "I've been dragging your tail for thirty years, hurry up! Tomorrow the Iron Ox brother will replace you." The captain of the Tianjie Brigade said that even if they didn't eat, they would use machines, suffering for a while for happiness for a lifetime, not doing it is foolish. Indeed, one chopstick is easy to break, but a handful of chopsticks cannot be broken. With the establishment of the commune, there are more people, more funds, and more labor. After a year of hard work, more than 1.7 million yuan was accumulated, and more than 200 pieces of machinery were added. Six thousand production laborers worked hard for half a year and opened the Jinshui Reservoir - the Jing'an River, built thousands of river channels and side ditches, opened up waterways in the north, south, west, and east, and installed fifty or so irrigation and drainage machines, so that 70% of the people no longer stepped on waterwheels. People call the old waterwheel a "foolish gourd" and the water pump an "iron dragon". Now, 800,000 labor forces are saved every year and put into field management. In the great drought of 1959, not a single grain was lost; in June, with 150 millimeters of heavy rain, just turning on the faucet ensured the safety of crops on tens of thousands of acres of fertile land. Places that had never seen machines before also used machines. The Binjiang Yanzhuang production captain, woke up after a night's sleep, and one thousand acres of sandbar land had been turned over completely. He said excitedly: "Even the gods didn't expect it to be so fast, and I have even more energy to carry wheat!"

    What does the great achievement of the past year show? It shows that the commune is large in scale and has sufficient strength. This is also the result of the broad masses of people and cadres constantly promoting the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and working hard and practically. I deeply realize that as long as the direction is correct, we can do it when we say so, and we can do it to the end, and difficulties will fall one after another. In action, as long as we are conscientious and down-to-earth, we can achieve a great leap forward. In the era of communization, running mechanization is not that "poor" cannot be done, as long as you work hard, it can be realized. But in the final analysis, one sentence: without the leadership of the Party and vigorously running people's communes, nothing can be thought of.

    Now we have seventeen tractors, fifty-five water pumps, thirteen seeders, two harvesters, more than thirty machine plows and machine harrows, as well as motorized sailboats and motorized trailers. No wonder the commune members want to say that the people's commune has added wings to our mechanization, and the speed of our mechanization is like a roc spreading its wings, flying a thousand miles a day! The fact is exactly like this. Several commune members of the Changjiang Brigade made an interesting analogy: they compared the primary cooperative to a "duck-watching boat," a small bottom that cannot withstand bumps. The advanced cooperative is like a "large sailboat," although it runs faster, it cannot cross the ocean and cannot handle big things. The people's commune is like a "large ship," which can ride the wind and waves, travel thousands of miles a day, and run fast and steadily. We are now sitting on this big ship and can completely transition to communism.

    The first year of the 1960s has begun, and this is another year that greatly encourages the people. We have the leadership of the Party, the support of the working-class elder brothers, and the fighting spirit of ten thousand people cheering and fighting decisively. A magnificent blueprint for comprehensive mechanization has been drawn up. In this year, we clenched our fists and want to ride on the electrified steed and saddle it with a new mechanized saddle. In 1960, we will fully realize the huge plan of mechanization: we will add 40 tractors of various types, 89 sets of matching tractor-drawn farm implements such as machine plows and machine harrows, 8 combine harvesters, 8 large compound threshers, 50 electric plows, 19 electric threshers throughout the year... 83,330 acres of cultivated land will be connected into large areas, and dozens of tractors will be able to gallop across 70% of the cultivated land, so that the oily black fertile soil will be turned over completely. Half of the three wheats will be harvested by machines, and sowing will be replaced by machines instead of hands. Rice transplanters come and go in the paddy fields, combine harvesters harvest wheat, cutting in the front and threshing in the back, followed by flour bagging. Mechanized irrigation stations will allow water to flow along dozens or hundreds of rivers and canals into tracts of fields. Roads extend in all directions, cars run on the roads, and the transportation capacity will be expanded to 1.4 million ton-kilometers.

    To realize these plans, we have a strong determination. We solemnly guarantee to the Party that we will achieve a total output of 100 million jin this year, which is equivalent to the total grain output from 1949 to 1952. In this year, we will grasp mechanical power as the key to drive all other industries to move forward!

    骏马配新鞍
    中共江苏江宁长江人民公社委员会书记　周友和
    我们长江人民公社，这块富饶的地方，正在迈开大步向农业机械化进军。十年前，在那黑布蒙天的旧社会，这里哪儿有一块钢有一件机器。可是今天你看吧！站在高地上，只见那一幅四方形的土地上，拖拉机成群结队，就像一列威武的坦克群，机手纵情高歌，威风凛凛地驰骋在大片土地上。闪闪发光的五铧犁、三铧犁，一下子就卷起了泥浪，把尺把深的肥土翻了上来。圆盘耙、丁齿耙，就像一把大铁梳，把乌油油大片大片的土块梳得细碎松匀。白色的机灌站，三管抽水机，一尊尊斜指着晴空。巨龙般的水柱，喷吐着白沫，把河水引到一块块的稻田里。稻场上，巨大的自动脱谷机张开了大口，以每小时脱粒两千五百斤的速度，把小山似的稻捆一堆堆地吃下去。站在江边，眺望着运输连队像长蛇泅水似地来往。晴空架上了电线网，电灯金光照亮了夜晚。机械厂已经成了全社生产动力的心脏。这一切，千件百桩都是三面红旗的巨大胜利。
    公社成立以前，国家在这里设立的代耕队，已经吸引了广大社员，机械化在三万八千人的脑海中成了最迫切的要求和愿望。营防大队支部书记，为了想用机械排灌，在靖安河畔不知走了多少趟。1958年秋天，公社的诞生，成了大办农业机械的起点。三万群众拿锹举耙、挑担提锄，把增产指标，推向高峰。雷鸣的号声，把人们的干劲鼓得更高；闹机械的声势浩大无边，个个意气风发，精神抖擞。机械运来以后人们更坚定了信心，鼓舞了斗志。临江大队社员老张，扶犁深翻，乐得对牛讲：
  “拖你尾巴三十年，快走吧！明天就有铁牛兄替换你了”。天介大队队长讲，不吃饭也要用机器，苦一时乐一辈，不干是呆子。确实一根筷子容易折，一把筷子拧不断，办了公社就是人多、资金多、劳力也多了。奋战了一年，积累了一百七十多万元，添购了二百多件机械。六千名生产壮士，苦干半年开了金水库——靖安大河，兴修万千河渠边沟，打通南北西东水路，架上了五十来部排灌机，使得70％的人不再踏水车。人称旧水车是“笨瓜”，称抽水机是“铁龙”，现在一年就节省了八十多万劳力，投入田间管理。大旱的1959年没有旱掉一棵粮；6月一百五十毫米大雨，仅仅掉转一下水龙头，万亩良田庄稼就保平安了。从来没有见过机器的地方，也用上了机器。滨江颜庄生产队长，睡一夜觉醒来，一千亩洲地泥土翻了一个大身，他兴奋地说：“神仙也没想到这样快，我挑麦劲头更大了！”
    一年来巨大成就，说明了什么呢？它说明了公社规模大，力量足。这也是广大群众、干部不断发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，实干苦干的结果。我深深地认识到：只要方向对头，说干就干，一干到底，困难会一倒百倒。在行动上只要兢兢业业，踏踏实实就能大跃进。在公社化的时代办机械化，不是“穷”不能办，只要干就能实现。但是归根结蒂一句话：没有党的领导和大办人民公社，什么事情也莫想。
    现在我们已有十七部拖拉机，五十五台抽水机，十三台播种机，两台收割机，三十多个机犁、机耙，还有机帆船，机动拖车等。难怪社员们要说，人民公社给我们的机械化添上了翅膀，我们的机械化的速度正像大鹏展翅，一日千里地在飞啊！事实正是这样，长江大队的几个社员打了个有趣的譬喻：他们把初级社比作是“看鸭子船”，小小的底儿经不起碰。高级社像条“大帆船”，虽然跑得快了些，但是还不能漂洋过海，办不起大事情。人民公社就像条“大轮船”，可以乘风破浪，日行千里，开得又快跑得又稳。我们现在坐在这条大轮船上，完全可以过渡到共产主义。
    六十年代的第一年开始了，这又是大鼓人心的一年。我们有党的领导，有工人老大哥的支持，又有万民欢腾决战的斗志，宏伟的全面机械化蓝图画出来了。在今年这一年，我们握紧了拳头，要跨上电气化骏马，配上机械化新鞍。我们在1960年要全面实现机械化的庞大规划：全年要添各种拖拉机四十台，机犁、机耙等配套牵引农具八十九部，联合收割机八台，大型复式脱粒机八台，电犁五十部，电动脱粒机十九台……。八万三千三百多亩耕地连成大片，几十部拖拉机，要在70％的耕地上纵横驰骋，让乌油油的肥土来个大翻身。三麦一半要用机器收割，播种要用机器代替双手。插秧机在水田里来来往往，联合收割机收麦，前面割，后面脱，紧接着面粉装上袋。机灌站要让水沿着几十条、几百条河渠，流入成片的田野。公路四通八达，公路走汽车，运输力量扩大到一百四十万吨公里。
    实现这些规划，我们有坚强的决心。我们向党提出庄严保证，今年要实现总产一亿斤，即相当于从1949年到1952年粮食产量的总和。在这一年中，我们要抓机械原动力作为关键，带动其它各行各业迈步前进！
