Doing a Good Job in Preventing and Treating Swine Diseases in Spring

A nationwide pig-raising movement is flourishing and moving forward. The current pig-raising situation is very good, breaking the conventional decline in pigs around the Spring Festival in previous years, and the number of pigs is rising in a straight line. The proportion of collective pig raising has greatly increased. The main task now is to ensure that all pigs do not get sick or die, that each one survives and grows strong, to consolidate the existing achievements, and to launch an even greater pig-raising upsurge on this basis.

The high-speed development of pig raising includes two aspects: on the one hand, to strengthen reproduction, to give birth more and faster; at the same time, it is more important to do a good job in epidemic prevention, so that pigs die as little as possible. More births and fewer deaths are an inseparable unity in the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry, and must be grasped at the same time. If we only pay attention to production and not to epidemic prevention, once a pig's infectious disease occurs, it will not only be a waste of previous efforts, wasting labor and feed, and causing economic losses, but also seriously dampen the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs. Especially at a time when large-scale collective feeding is increasingly developing, vigorously grasping the prevention and treatment of pig diseases and eliminating infectious diseases is a revolutionary measure to ensure the high-speed development of pig production. Party committees at all levels should take epidemic prevention as a major event in the development of pig production and earnestly grasp it. Currently, the season is entering spring, and the temperature and humidity are suitable for the survival and reproduction of germs and viruses. In addition, a large number of piglets are born, and large pigs are relatively weak after the severe winter. This is the time when infectious diseases are most likely to occur. "Bamboo shoots grow into forests, sick pigs become groups" and "Peach blossoms bloom, swine fever comes" are two proverbs that reflect the past patterns of pig infectious diseases. Although there are many types of pig infectious diseases, the sources of disease are only bacteria and viruses. Their common characteristics are that they like to survive and reproduce in dark and humid places, and are not easy to survive in high-temperature, dry, sunny, and clean places. We must master and apply the epidemic patterns of pig diseases and the characteristics of the sources of disease, seize the opportunity before infectious diseases occur, immediately mobilize, and launch a spring epidemic prevention upsurge to strive for no infectious diseases of pigs in collective pig farms this year, and no deaths of any pigs.

In recent years, due to the development of epidemic prevention work, pig diseases in various places have been greatly reduced. However, we must never be paralyzed and complacent because of this, and we must not have any laissez-faire attitude. It should be recognized that eliminating infectious diseases is not an easy task. Although there are no infectious diseases now, as long as the pathogens have not been completely eliminated, epidemics may recur at any time, and we must persevere through repeated struggles. Even if it is eliminated in one region, if it has not been eliminated in neighboring regions, it may be transmitted, and we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest. Pig asthma and piglet white dysentery, which are currently more prevalent, should be vigorously prevented. Some people think that now that there are more pigs, and a pig farm has thousands of pigs, it doesn't matter if one or two die. On the contrary, the more pigs are raised, the more attention should be paid to reducing deaths. If one pig dies in a pig farm, then more than two million pig farms across the country would mean more than two million pigs. In addition, the death of a pig means a loss of more than 100 kilograms of pork, which is equivalent to losing a fertilizer plant and reducing the production of 200 to 300 kilograms of grain, and also reduces the income from pig by-products by 35 yuan. Calculated in this way, the death of one or two pigs is indeed no small matter. What's more, once an infectious disease occurs, if it is not handled properly, it will leave a root cause for the entire farm, and it cannot be regarded as a trivial matter. In addition, some people think that pigs are dirty things, and it is inevitable that they will get infectious diseases, especially with the increase in pig raising and the large-scale development of collective pig raising, which makes it easier to transmit. In fact, on the contrary, pigs, like other animals, are very fond of cleanliness, and it is entirely possible to be clean, and infectious diseases can also be completely avoided. Collective pig raising is not easy to transmit, but it is more conducive to eliminating pig infectious diseases. Not paying attention to hygiene in pig raising was a matter of the old society. In the old society, the exploiting classes only ate meat and did not raise pigs, let alone care about the prevention and treatment of pig diseases. The pig raisers were poor farmers. Under the cruel exploitation of the exploiting classes, the farmers were never full or warm all year round, so how could they care about the hygiene of pigs? Of course, they did not have much power to prevent and treat pig diseases. After liberation, this situation has improved somewhat. However, in the era of agricultural cooperatives, private raising was still the main thing. Scattered pig raising by individual households meant limited strength, and it was impossible to fundamentally improve the hygiene conditions of pigs, nor could it fundamentally prevent the occurrence of any pig diseases. Once the People's Commune appeared, large-scale collective pig farms were established everywhere, which created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for improving pig hygiene and eliminating pig infectious diseases. The communes established breeding farms, breeding and raising their own pigs, which can greatly reduce the opportunity for the spread of epidemics due to the transfer and transportation of piglets. The communes vigorously run collective pig farms, which is conducive to building reasonable pig houses and improving the hygiene conditions of pigs; pig farms promote scientific feeding and management methods, with dedicated personnel responsible for managing pigs in groups according to boars, sows, fattening pigs, frame pigs, and weak pigs, and feeding them regularly and quantitatively, which is conducive to raising pigs well and strongly, and increasing disease resistance. Pig houses and management tools are disinfected regularly, personnel entering and leaving the pig house are disinfected, pig pens are frequently raised and padded, kept clean and dry, and attention is often paid to the health examination of pigs. If sick pigs are found, they are isolated, diagnosed, and treated in a timely manner; in the event of death due to illness, the carcasses are cooked, processed, and buried according to the nature of the disease to eliminate the source of the epidemic and eliminate the opportunity for infection. All this shows that collective pig raising is not that it cannot improve the hygiene conditions of pigs, nor that it cannot prevent the occurrence of various pig diseases, but that it can better improve the hygiene conditions of pigs and is more conducive to preventing pig diseases. Isn't this exactly what the facts have proved? Due to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels in pig raising work, the establishment of epidemic prevention institutions at the commune, team, and farm levels, the training of a large number of epidemic prevention workers, and the strengthening of the epidemic prevention team, epidemic prevention measures can be consistently implemented. The People's Commune is larger and more public than before, and it is also different compared with the advanced cooperative; things that could not be done before can now be done, and things that could be done on a small scale before can now be done on a large scale. In the past, pig raising was unhygienic, but now it can pay attention to hygiene; in the past, pig infectious diseases could not be eliminated, but now they can be eliminated. Since 1958, Deng County, Henan Province, has held high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, adhered to putting politics in command, launched a vigorous mass movement, vigorously cultivated technical personnel, carried out preventive inoculation and disinfection hygiene work in a timely manner, and strengthened feeding management. After repeated inspections and acceptance over the past two years, no pig infectious diseases have ever been found, and a county without pig epidemic diseases has been achieved.

To carry out epidemic prevention work, it is necessary to earnestly implement the principle of prevention being more important than cure and adopt comprehensive epidemic prevention measures. This is the key to stopping the spread of pig infectious diseases and even eliminating pig infectious diseases. Epidemic prevention and treatment is not an isolated work and must be closely combined with other work, such as effectively solving the feed problem and strengthening feeding management. Preventing before disease is a positive and proactive way to get to the root of the problem. No matter how good the treatment method is, it is not as good as not getting sick; getting sick has the possibility of death, and even if it is cured, it will affect the normal development of the pig. So can we implement preventive measures and ensure that pigs do not get sick? This is entirely possible. Longtan Commune in Dali City, Yunnan Province, gave play to the superiority of the People's Commune, established a veterinary hospital, and 12 management districts established veterinary offices, drawing party and league members to actively cultivate a veterinary epidemic prevention team. Every spring, before pig diseases become prevalent, they carry out preventive inoculations and conduct regular disinfection. At the same time, they also adopt a combination of local and foreign methods, making full use of the favorable conditions in mountainous areas to extensively collect various local medicines, and also bought the necessary injection medicines to prevent and treat pig diseases. Veterinary epidemic prevention personnel at all levels of the commune constantly help various teams carry out epidemic prevention and treatment work through inspections, and pass on general epidemic prevention knowledge and technology to each breeder, and help the breeders establish hygiene and epidemic prevention systems. Now most of the more than 200 breeders in the 64 pig farms in the entire commune can identify common pig diseases and can also prepare Chinese medicine prescriptions. As soon as the pig gets sick, they immediately isolate and treat it. Thanks to the above measures, pig infectious diseases have been eliminated, and all the more than 6,400 pigs in the entire commune are growing strong. In the country, communes that have controlled pig infectious diseases like Longtan Commune are definitely not the only one, and a number of pig epidemic-free counties and pig epidemic-free provinces have also emerged. For example, Hunan Province eliminated swine fever in 1959. Last year, the province's meat joint processing plant slaughtered 1.2 million fat pigs, and no swine fever pigs were found. This is an unimaginable miracle in the old society. We must not only create such miracles in one province, but also in all pig farms across the country.

In carrying out regular epidemic prevention and seasonal blitz epidemic prevention work, it is also necessary to implement the two-pronged approach of combining local and foreign methods and combining Chinese and Western medicine, and to launch a vigorous mass movement. It must be seen that under the conditions of the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry, the development of my country's veterinary and veterinary drug industry is far from being able to meet the needs of actual work. It is still impossible to completely rely on veterinary talents trained by regular schools and veterinary drugs manufactured by pharmaceutical companies to solve the epidemic prevention problems of millions of pig farms across the country. On the other hand, my country is the earliest country in the world to raise pigs, and the broad masses have rich experience in raising pigs. Even under the extremely difficult conditions in the past, the masses have also summed up many local prescriptions and local medicines for preventing and treating pig diseases from rich practice. Many experienced pig-raising experts are often local experts in preventing and treating pig diseases. The original Chinese medicine in our country has also accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience in treating pig diseases. Therefore, only by following the road of combining local and foreign methods, using both local and foreign medicines, combining local experts and foreign experts, and combining Chinese and Western medicine, and starting together from all sides, can the pig epidemic prevention work be done more, faster, better, and more economically. In addition, because more and more pigs are raised, it is very concentrated to do a good job in seasonal epidemic prevention work. Even if a preventive injection is given universally, it is necessary to mobilize many people to take a blitz approach; more importantly, it is necessary to carry out regular epidemic prevention work. This requires breeders to strengthen the feeding management of pigs and do a good job in the environmental hygiene of pig farms in order to fundamentally eliminate the occurrence of infectious diseases. Therefore, many places have adopted the method of launching a vigorous mass movement, running epidemic prevention training classes and training courses, training general breeders to have simple epidemic prevention knowledge, and cultivating some of them into epidemic prevention workers. Many regions should vigorously produce swine fever rabbit attenuated vaccine and aureomycin, oxytetracycline and other antibiotics to ensure the supply of necessary drugs. This drug is easy to manufacture, low in cost, and highly effective, and every commune can manufacture it. Xinle County, Hebei, which has achieved one pig per mu, has established a mass veterinary epidemic prevention team throughout the county through various methods, ensuring that every commune, every production team, and every pig farm has its own epidemic prevention talents. These people are either veterinarians trained by specialized schools, or Chinese medicine practitioners, or local experts and breeding experts. When Minhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, launched the spring epidemic prevention campaign this year, each county established an epidemic prevention command and organized more than 50,000 people, including cadres, veterinarians, epidemic prevention workers, breeders, young people, and women, to adopt the method of contracting by area, checking栏 by 栏, and injecting pig by pig, and completed the injection work of more than 359,000 pigs in the county. Commune members of Guozhuang Commune in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, used local methods to make more than a dozen local medicines for treating pig diseases, such as alizarin and ume extracts, with good results.

Eliminating pig infectious diseases is a holistic task, and it is necessary to strengthen joint prevention and cooperation. If a pig infectious disease occurs in one farm or one commune, it can threaten the pig raising safety of neighboring areas. Therefore, if the epidemic prevention work in some areas is not done well, it will not only be detrimental to the commune and farm itself, but also to other communes and farms. For the benefit of oneself and others, one should proactively and actively do a good job in epidemic prevention and eliminate epidemic diseases. On the other hand, communes and farms where no epidemic diseases have occurred should not only consolidate their own epidemic prevention achievements, but also actively assist neighboring communes and farms in manpower, material resources, and technology to do a good job in epidemic prevention, jointly eliminate pig diseases, and ensure the healthy development of pigs.

The key to doing a good job in epidemic prevention lies in the leadership of the party. The party secretaries at all levels in charge of animal husbandry work should personally take the lead, grasp production with one hand and epidemic prevention with the other, make specific arrangements for epidemic prevention time, manpower, and material resources, mobilize the broad masses, widely publicize the importance of doing a good job in epidemic prevention and scientific knowledge of epidemic prevention, carry out epidemic prevention competitions, establish epidemic prevention pacesetters, and constantly study and summarize the successful experiences and advanced methods of epidemic prevention, and introduce and promote them in a timely manner. At present, it is even more necessary to universally launch a mass spring epidemic prevention upsurge to ensure the greater and faster development of the pig-raising industry in 1960.

    做好春季猪病防治工作
    一个全民性的养猪运动，正蓬勃地向前发展。目前养猪形势好得很，打破了历年春节前后生猪下降的常规，猪数直线上升。集体养猪的比重大大增加。当前的主要任务是保证所有的猪不病不死，头头成活，健壮生长，巩固已有的成果，并在此基础上掀起一个更大的养猪高潮。
    高速度发展养猪的内容包括两方面，一方面要加强繁殖，多生、快生，同时更要做好防疫工作，使猪只尽量不死。多生、不死，是高速度发展养猪事业中不可分割的统一体，必须同时抓好。只重视生产，不注意防疫，一旦发生猪的传染病，不仅前功尽弃，浪费了人工、饲料，造成经济上的损失，而且将严重的挫伤群众养猪的热情。特别是目前大规模集体饲养越来越发展的时候，大抓猪病防治，杜绝传染病发生，是保证养猪生产高速度发展的一个革命措施。各级党委部门应该把防疫工作当做发展养猪生产的一件大事，认真地抓起来。当前节令进入春天，气温、湿度都适合病菌、病毒的生存繁殖，又有大批仔猪出生，大猪经过严冬也都比较瘦弱，这时最容易发生传染病。“竹笋成林，病猪成群”、“桃花开，猪瘟来”，这两句谚语反映了过去猪传染病的流行规律。猪传染病的种类虽然很多，但是病源只有病菌和病毒，它们共同的特性都喜欢在阴暗、潮湿的地方生存、繁殖，在高温、干燥、阳光照射和清洁地方就不容易生存。我们要掌握和运用猪病的流行规律和病源的特性，在传染病未发生之前抓紧时机，立即动员起来，掀起一个春季防疫高潮，争取今年集体养猪场不发生猪的传染病，不死一头猪。
    几年来由于防疫工作的开展，各地猪病大大减少。但是，我们绝不能因此产生任何麻痹自满情绪，不能有任何一点放任自流。应该认识到，消灭传染病，不是轻而易举的事，现在虽然没有发生传染病，只要病原菌没有彻底消灭，疫病随时都有复发的可能，必须坚持不懈地经过反复的斗争。就是在一个地区消灭了，如果邻近地区还没有消灭，就有可能传染，不能丝毫放松防范。目前流行较广的猪气喘病和仔猪白痢病，更应大力防止。有人认为现在猪养得多了，一个养猪场成千上万头猪，死一、两头算不了什么。恰恰相反，猪越是养得多了，越要注意减少死亡。如果一个猪场死一头，全国二百多万个猪场就是二百多万头。另外死一头猪就损失了一百多斤猪肉，就等于丢掉一个化肥厂，少产二百到三百斤粮食，也减少猪的副产品收入三十五元。这样一算，死一头两头猪，也的确是非同小可的事。何况传染病一旦发生，如果处理不好，就会给全场留下病根，更不能当成小事。另外，还有人认为猪是脏东西，难免不得传染病，特别是养猪多了，大量发展集体养猪，更容易传染。事实恰恰相反，猪和别的动物一样，是很爱清洁的，完全可以做到不脏，传染病也完全可以避免，集体养猪不是容易传染，而是更有利于消灭猪的传染病。养猪不讲究卫生，那是旧社会的事情。在旧社会里剥削阶级只吃肉，不养猪，更不会去关心防治猪病。养猪的是穷苦的农民，在剥削阶级残酷的压榨下，农民终年不得饱暖，那里还顾得上猪的卫生呢，当然更没有多少力量来防治猪病。解放以后，这种情况已有所改善。但在农业社时代基本上还是私养为主，一家一户分散养猪，力量毕竟有限，也不可能从根本上改善猪的卫生条件，不能根本上防止任何猪病发生。人民公社一经出现，各地大办集体养猪场，就给搞好猪的卫生，消灭猪的传染病，创造了空前有利的条件。公社建立了繁殖场，自繁自养，就能够大大减少由于仔猪调剂调运传播疫病的机会。公社大办集体猪场，便于兴建合理的猪舍，改善猪的卫生条件；养猪场推行科学的饲养管理方法，有专人负责，按公猪、母猪、育肥猪、架子猪、瘦弱猪分群管理，定时定量喂养，便于把猪养好养壮，增加抗病力。猪舍、管理用具定期消毒，出入场舍人员消毒，猪圈勤起勤垫，保持清洁干燥，经常注意猪的健康检查，发现病猪及时进行隔离、诊断、治疗；万一病死，尸体按病的性质煮熟、加工、掩埋处理，便于消灭疫源，杜绝传染机会。这一切都说明，集体养猪不是不能改善猪的卫生条件，不是不能防止各种猪病发生，而是更能够改善猪的卫生条件了，而是更有利于防止猪病发生了。事实不正是这样证明了吗？由于各级党委对养猪工作加强了领导，建立了社、队、场的防疫机构，培训大批防疫员，壮大了防疫队伍，就能经常贯彻执行防疫措施。人民公社一大二公，和解放以前的小农经济大不相同，和高级社相比也有不同；以前不能办的事现在办到了，以前能小办的事，现在能大办了。过去养猪不卫生，现在可以讲究卫生了；以前不能消灭猪的传染病，现在可以消灭了。河南省邓县1958年以来，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大力培养技术人员，及时开展预防注射和消毒卫生工作，加强饲养管理。两年来经过多次检查验收，从未发现过猪的传染病，实现了无猪疫病县。
    开展防疫工作，必须认真地贯彻执行防重于治的方针，采取综合性的防疫措施，这是制止猪传染病蔓延以至消灭猪传染病的关键。疫病防治不是孤立的工作，必须与别的工作例如切实解决饲料问题，加强饲养管理等密切结合起来。无病先防是一项积极主动的治本的办法，治疗的方法再好，也不如不发病；发病就有死亡的可能，就是治好了也影响猪的正常发育。那末我们能不能贯彻预防措施、保证猪不发病呢？这是完全可以办到的。云南大理市龙潭公社，发挥人民公社的优越性，成立了一所兽医院，十二个管理区都建立了兽医室，抽调党、团员积极分子培养了兽医防疫队伍，每年春天在猪病流行前，进行预防注射，定期进行消毒，同时还采取了土洋结合的办法，充分利用山区有利条件大量采挖各种土药，还买了必要的打针药品防治猪病。公社各级兽医防疫人员，又不断通过巡回检查，帮助各队开展防疫治疗工作，把一般防疫知识、技术传授给每个饲养员，并帮助饲养员建立卫生防疫制度，现在全社六十四个养猪场的二百多名饲养员，大多数都能识别猪的一般病，还能配制中药处方，猪一生病，马上隔离治疗。由于采取了以上措施，消灭了猪的传染病，全社六千四百多头猪，头头生长健壮。在全国，像这样控制了猪的传染病的公社绝不止龙潭公社一个，而且还出现了一批无猪疫病县和无猪疫省。如湖南省1959年已经消灭了猪瘟，该省肉类联合加工厂去年屠宰了一百二十万头肥猪，没有发现一头瘟猪。这在旧社会简直是不可想像的奇迹。我们不仅在一个省内，而且还要全国所有的养猪场都出现这样的奇迹。
    在开展经常性的防疫和季节性的突击防疫工作中，还要贯彻土洋并举、中西医相结合的两条腿走路的方针，大搞群众运动。必须看到在养猪业高速度发展的情况下，我国的兽医、兽药事业的发展，远远不能适应实际工作的需要。要完全依靠正规学校培养出来的兽医人才和医药公司制造出来的兽药来解决全国几百万个养猪场的防疫问题，在目前还是办不到的。另一方面，我国是世界上养猪最早的国家，广大群众有着丰富的养猪经验，即使是在过去极端困难的条件下，群众从丰富的实践中也总结了不少防治猪病的土方和土药，许多有经验的养猪能手常常就是防治猪病的土专家。我国民间原有的中医在治猪病方面也积累了不少知识和经验。因此，只有走土洋并举、中西医相结合的道路，土药、洋药并用，土专家、洋专家相结合，中西医相结合，从四面八方一起动手，猪的防疫工作才能做得又多又快又好又省。另外，因为猪养得愈来愈多，要做好季节性的防疫工作，时间很集中，即使是普遍打一次预防针，也要发动许多人采取突击的方式；更重要的是要开展经常性的防疫工作，这就要求饲养员加强猪的饲养管理，做好猪场的环境卫生，才能从根本上杜绝传染病的发生。因此许多地方采取大搞群众运动办法，开办防疫训练班和讲习班，训练一般的饲养员有简单的防疫知识，其中一部分培养成为防疫员。许多地区应当大搞猪瘟兔化疫苗及金霉素、土霉素等抗菌素的制造，保证必要的药物供应。这种药物制造方便，成本低廉，而收效甚大，每个公社都可以制造。已经实现了一亩地一头猪的河北新乐县就通过各种办法，在全县建立了一支群众性的兽医防疫队伍，做到了每个公社，每个生产队的每个养猪场，都有自己的防疫人才。这些人或者是专门学校培养出的兽医，或者是中医，或者就是土专家和饲养能手。福建省闽侯专区在今年开展春季防疫运动时，各县都成立了防疫指挥部，组织干部、兽医、防疫员、饲养员、青年、妇女等五万多人，采取分片包干，逐栏检查，头头注射的办法，完成了全县三十五万九千多头猪的注射工作。河北藁城县郭庄公社社员用土法制出茜草素、乌梅素等十几种治猪病的土药，效果很好。
    消灭猪的传染病，是一个整体工作，必须加强联防协作。如果一个场或一个社发生猪传染病，就能威胁到邻近地区的养猪安全。因此有些地区的防疫工作做不好，不但对本社、本场不利，同时对别社、别场也不利。为了利己利人，应该主动地积极地把防疫工作做好，消灭疫病。另一方面没有疫病发生的社、场除了巩固本社、本场的防疫成果外，还应当在人力、物力、技术上主动协助邻近的社、场做好防疫工作，共同消灭猪病，保证生猪健康发展。
    搞好防疫工作的关键在于党的领导。各级负责畜牧工作的党委书记，要亲自挂帅，一手抓生产，一手抓防疫，把防疫时间和人力、物力进行具体安排，发动广大群众，广泛宣传做好防疫工作的重要性和防疫的科学知识，开展防疫竞赛，树立防疫标兵，并要经常研究总结防疫的成功经验及先进办法，及时介绍推广。当前更要普遍掀起一个群众性的春季防疫高潮，保证1960年养猪事业更大更快的发展。
