Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: According to TASS, Soviet Premier Khrushchev visited the southern French port city of Marseille and Dijon, one of France's cultural centers, on the 28th, and was warmly welcomed by the people.

	In the morning, Khrushchev attended a reception held in his honor at the Marseille City Hall. Many Marseilles residents waiting to welcome Khrushchev next to the City Hall greeted the Soviet guests with thunderous applause and cheers.

	After Marseille Mayor Defferre delivered a welcoming speech, Khrushchev spoke. He emphasized the importance of complete and thorough disarmament. Khrushchev said that the people of all countries should work together to block the path to war and seek complete and thorough disarmament. Currently, the world spends approximately $100 billion, or 500 billion new francs, annually on military purposes, and at least 100 million people work in the military and in those military-related industries. All these vast human and material resources are virtually excluded from the production of material goods. Complete and thorough disarmament will create conditions for lasting peace and make it possible to use huge funds for peaceful purposes. Therefore, the Soviet Union calls on all countries not to act under the dangerous slogan of "Arm!", but under the rational slogan of "Disarm!".

	Khrushchev said that complete and thorough disarmament and the consolidation of peace based on it will open up unlimited possibilities for international trade. We advocate the development of broad trade between all countries without exception, without any obstacles or restrictions. We advocate the development of economic ties between the Soviet Union and France. The trade volume between France and the Soviet Union almost doubled in 1959 compared to 1958. However, of course, there are huge possibilities to expand trade between the Soviet Union and France.

	Khrushchev said that Marseille is often called France's gateway to the East. We see how the national awakening of the people of all countries is flourishing in the East. This cannot be ignored. The spirit of the times requires that relations with these countries must be established on a new basis, on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Only on this basis can the historically formed ties between independent and equal countries be maintained.

	Khrushchev said that the hospitality we received in Marseille gives us hope that the friendship between the people of France and the Soviet Union will continue to develop and strengthen!

	Khrushchev pointed out that only bats that cannot see the sun would think that the sun does not exist at all. People who are blinded by hatred of communism believe that if there is no contact between socialist and capitalist countries, between national leaders (they are against such contact), the doctrine of communism will not exist because of this, and socialist countries will not exist because of this. This is an unwise policy and is doomed to bankruptcy.

	After the luncheon, Khrushchev and his entourage left Marseille by plane for Dijon. On the way from Dijon Airport to the city, Khrushchev visited the construction project and dispatching equipment of the Givry-Chambolle-Musigny railway hub.

	Dijon First Deputy Mayor Viers and other officials welcomed Khrushchev in front of the City Hall. Khrushchev and Viers exchanged speeches. At this time, the square could no longer accommodate the growing crowd, and many people climbed onto the eaves. A group of young people held up the flags of the Soviet Union and France and shouted:
  “Dijon—Stalingrad!” The Dijon City Council and the Stalingrad City Soviet recently signed a friendship and brotherhood treaty between the two cities.

	The Dijon Municipal Committee hosted a banquet for Khrushchev on the evening of the 28th. Mayor Kir Pastor was unable to welcome Khrushchev in person. Church leaders blocked Kir from meeting with Khrushchev because Khrushchev was a Communist.

	Khrushchev said at the banquet that during the Second World War, Dijon was one of the largest centers of the French Resistance. Soviet prisoners of war who joined the French guerrillas in the suburbs of Dijon fought side by side with French patriots against the Hitlerite aggressors.

	Khrushchev said that the fighting cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and France has strengthened the friendship between the people of the two countries, and this friendship should be cherished and developed.

    马赛和第戎人民盛情欢迎苏联贵宾
    赫鲁晓夫强调裁军的重要意义
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫28日在法国南方海港城市马赛和法国文化中心之一第戎市进行访问，受到人民的热烈欢迎。
    上午，赫鲁晓夫到马赛市政厅出席为他举行的招待会。在市政厅旁等着欢迎赫鲁晓夫的许多马赛人用暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼向苏联贵宾致意。
    在马赛市长德费尔致欢迎词后，赫鲁晓夫讲话。他强调全面彻底裁军的重要意义。赫鲁晓夫说，各国人民应当共同努力、堵塞战争的道路，求得全面彻底裁军。现在世界上消耗于军事用途的款项每年约达一千亿美元，也就是五千亿新法郎，而在军队中和在那些军事用途工业部门工作的至少有一亿人。所有这些庞大的人力物力实际上完全排除在生产物质资料的范围之外。全面彻底裁军将为巩固的和平创造条件，同时使得有可能把巨额资金用于和平目的。因此，苏联号召所有的国家不要在“武装！”这个危险的口号下行动，而要在“裁军！”这个理智的口号下行动。
    赫鲁晓夫说，全面彻底裁军和以此为基础的巩固和平将会为国际贸易开辟无限的可能性。我们主张各国之间一无例外地、没有任何障碍和限制地发展广泛的贸易。我们主张发展苏联和法国之间的经济联系。法苏两国之间的贸易额在1959年几乎比1958年增加了一倍半。但是，当然还有巨大的可能性来扩大苏法之间的贸易。
    赫鲁晓夫说，马赛通常被称为法国通向东方的大门。我们看到，在东方，各国人民的民族觉醒是如何正在蓬勃地发展。对这一点是不能不加以考虑的。时代的精神要求，必须在新的基础上、在平等和互相尊重的基础上同这些国家建立关系。只有在这个基础上，可以维持历史形成的独立平等国家的联系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们在马赛所受到的招待，使我们产生这样的希望：法苏两国人民的友谊将不断发展和加强！
    赫鲁晓夫指出，只有见不到太阳的蝙蝠才会认为太阳根本不存在。由于憎恨共产主义而盲目起来的人认为，如果在社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间、在国家领导人之间没有接触（他们是反对这种接触的），共产主义的学说就会因此而不存在，社会主义国家就会因此而不存在。这是一个不明智的政策，注定要破产。
    午宴后，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员乘飞机离马赛前往第戎。在从第戎机场前往市区途中，赫鲁晓夫参观了日夫尔—沙贝尔坦铁路枢纽的建筑工程和调度设备。
    第戎市第一副市长维耶和其他一些官员在市政厅门前欢迎赫鲁晓夫。赫鲁晓夫和维耶相互致词。这时候广场上已容纳不下越来越多的人群了，许多人爬到屋檐上。一批青年举着苏联和法国的国旗呼着：
  “第戎—斯大林格勒！”第戎市议会与斯大林格勒市苏维埃最近签订了一项两个城市之间的友好与兄弟条约。
    第戎市市政委员会28日晚间设宴招待赫鲁晓夫。市长基尔牧师未能亲自欢迎赫鲁晓夫。教会上层分子阻挠基尔同赫鲁晓夫会见，因为赫鲁晓夫是共产党员。
    赫鲁晓夫在宴会上讲话说，在第二次世界大战期间，第戎曾是法国抵抗运动的最大中心之一。在第戎市郊参加了法国游击队的苏联战俘曾同法国的爱国者并肩作战反对希特勒侵略者。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联和法国两国人民的战斗的合作加强了两国人民的友谊，应当珍惜和发展这种友谊。
