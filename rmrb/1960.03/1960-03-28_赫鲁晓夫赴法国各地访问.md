Xinhua News Agency, Bordeaux, March 27th: According to TASS, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev and his entourage arrived in Bordeaux by special plane from Paris on the morning of the 26th, beginning his five-day visit to various provinces of France.

Bordeaux is a large port on the French Atlantic coast and an industrial, commercial, and cultural center, famous for its wine production.

Accompanying Khrushchev on his visit to various parts of France were French Minister of Education Joxe, Director-General of the Ministry of Interior Meret, French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Dejean, Soviet Ambassador to France Vinogradov, and others.

Representatives of local authorities, led by Bordeaux Mayor and President of the French National Assembly Chaban-Delmas, welcomed Khrushchev at the Bordeaux airport.

Along the five-kilometer road from the airport to the city of Bordeaux, behind the soldiers of various arms, were tens of thousands of Bordeaux citizens welcoming Khrushchev. They waved small French and Soviet flags and colorful balloons to greet the Soviet guests.

Khrushchev visited residential construction in the village of Benauge, a suburb of Bordeaux, and the Bordeaux Sports Palace, where he was warmly cheered by a large crowd in the Sports Palace Square. The head of the Soviet government and his entourage then went to the Grand Theater in the center of Bordeaux to meet with representatives of local authorities and prominent figures. A welcoming crowd also gathered in the square in front of the Grand Theater. They shouted slogans such as "Long live peace" and "Peace and friendship."

Later, Khrushchev went to the City Hall to attend a luncheon held for him by Mayor Chaban-Delmas. In his speech, Chaban-Delmas expressed the hope that the Soviet government leader's visit would help the development of trade and cultural exchanges between France and the Soviet Union. In his reply, Khrushchev said, "The cause of ensuring peace and security in Europe and the world urgently requires the development and strengthening of friendship and cooperation between our two great nations on the basis of mutual respect."

On the same day, Khrushchev and his entourage flew to the city of Tarbes in the Upper Pyrenees, where they were welcomed at the airport by thousands of local workers, farmers, and urban residents.

As soon as Khrushchev stepped out of the cabin, people raised colorful small flags to greet him, and many people broke through the guards' barriers and crowded near the airport building, shouting slogans such as "Peace!" and "Long live French-Soviet friendship!" The guards tried to stop the crowd. However, the citizens of Tarbes continued to shout welcoming slogans and sing The Internationale.

Later, Khrushchev and his entourage visited the small working-class town of Meulans, and then traveled by car from Tarbes to the city of Lacq, which is famous for its gas and oil production. Khrushchev visited gas and oil factories in this center of the French chemical industry.

In the evening, Khrushchev and his entourage arrived in Pau, in the Lower Pyrenees, for the night. In this ancient French castle, young men and women in ancient national costumes welcomed Khrushchev. The welcoming crowd did not disperse until late.

    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社波尔多讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员26日晨乘专机从巴黎抵达波尔多，开始他对法国各省为期五天的访问。
    波尔多是法国大西洋沿岸的大港口和工业、贸易、文化中心，以产酒闻名。
    陪同赫鲁晓夫到法国各地访问的有法国教育部长若克斯、内政部总监梅雷、法国驻苏联大使德让、苏联驻法国大使维格拉多夫等人。
    以波尔多市长兼法国国民议会议长沙邦—戴尔马为首的地方当局代表在波尔多机场上欢迎赫鲁晓夫。
    从机场到波尔多市全长五公里道路两旁，在各兵种士兵的后面挤满了成千上万欢迎赫鲁晓夫的波尔多市民。他们摇动手中小的法国和苏联国旗和五色缤纷的气球向苏联客人致意。
    赫鲁晓夫参观了波尔多市郊贝诺日村的住宅建设和波尔多的体育宫，在体育宫广场上受到大批群众热烈欢呼。苏联政府首脑和他的随行人员接着来到波尔多市中心的大剧院，同当地当局的代表和著名人士会见。在大剧院门前广场上同样聚集了欢迎的人群。他们高呼着“和平万岁”、“和平友谊”等口号。
    以后，赫鲁晓夫来到市政厅，参加市长沙邦—戴尔马为他举行的午宴。沙邦—戴尔马在致词中表示希望，苏联政府首脑的访问将有助于法苏两国贸易和文化交流的发展。赫鲁晓夫在答词中说，“保证欧洲和全世界和平和安全的事业迫切要求我们两个大国之间发展和加强以相互尊敬为基础的友谊和合作。”
    当天赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员乘飞机到了上比利牛斯省的塔布城，在机场上受到当地数千工人、农民和城市居民的欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫刚一走出机舱，人们就举起五彩缤纷的小旗向他致意，许多人穿过警卫的阻拦拥近机场建筑物。高呼“和平！”、“法苏友谊万岁！”等口号。警卫人员企图阻住人群。但是塔布市民继续呼喊欢迎口号，并高唱国际歌。
    后来，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员参观了工人小城镇木朗，然后从塔布乘汽车到以产煤气和石油著称的拉克市。赫鲁晓夫在法国这个化学工业中心参观了煤气和石油工厂。
    晚间，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员来到下比利牛斯省的波城过夜。在这个古老的法国城堡中，青年男女穿着古老的民族服装欢迎赫鲁晓夫。欢迎的人群很晚还没有走散。
