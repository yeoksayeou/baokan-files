Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 6th. Our correspondent He Changhua reports: A storm of technological innovation and revolution is sweeping through Shanghai, a major industrial city. In this storm, the Shanghai working class has demonstrated unprecedented ambition and a bold communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Communist ideology is growing vigorously in people's consciousness, relentlessly destroying the remnants of old thinking and entrenched habits, and transforming labor and production at an accelerating pace. This new style emerging in a new era is the most distinctive feature of the current excellent situation.

In the great practice of implementing the General Line, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai have fully recognized their own strength. They have even greater ambitions and higher aspirations, dissatisfied with the current level of production technology and determined to change its face at the highest speed, scaling new heights. From steel, casting, processing, assembly, and packaging to the handling, loading, unloading, sewing, embroidery, washing, shoe-making, cooking, and cutting that have been manual operations for thousands of years... people are joyfully engaged in large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization. From veteran workers to apprentices, from male workers to female workers, everyone is consciously revolutionizing heavy labor and manual operations. In many factories, more than 90% of the people have plunged into the torrent of revolution. The masses call this revolution the "second liberation" after their political and economic emancipation. In the past, workers at the Shanghai Bicycle Factory (state-owned) wore cotton leather aprons and rubber boots for electroplating, carrying parts weighing more than twenty pounds, walking more than twenty miles in the workshop for eight hours, with high labor intensity and poor working conditions. Now, they have manufactured a large-scale combined automatic electroplating machine, and the situation has completely changed. After a string of hanging parts is plated in one tank, it automatically rises and moves to the next tank. An electroplating worker, to celebrate his "liberation," bought a red five-pointed star and embedded it on the automatic electroplating machine. Transportation workers made a revolution in the first twenty days of February, and a magnificent scene of "derricks in forests, cranes in nets, winches in sets, and small cars in strings" appeared at major railway freight stations. Workers in factory transport have abandoned carrying poles and started using machines. Elderly porters at the Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory also "aspire to be not too old" and issued bold statements: vowing to retire the carrying pole first and work for socialism for another ten years. Female packaging workers are determined not to injure their hands or get blisters, and to double production. With the help of male workers, they successfully trial-produced machines for packaging more than twenty kinds of light industrial products such as cigarettes, candy, toothpaste, cold cream, matches, and sewing needles, greatly liberating their hands. Even embroidery workers picked up wrenches and files to electrify embroidery.

More and more people, in order to catch up with the world's advanced level, are climbing the peaks of science and technology with unyielding spirit. They say: "What others have, we must have; what others do not have, we will create!" Some cutting-edge products they had never even seen before, but through bold imagination and hard work, they finally created them. Wang Linhe of the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, after 371 experiments, made the "eye" for inspecting the performance of insulating materials in high-voltage circuits - the high-voltage bridge. Now, many Wang Linhe-style figures have appeared everywhere. In the factory where Wang Linhe works, four ordinary young female workers, after 580 calibrations, successfully trial-produced a set of "precision standard self-inductance," increasing the precision from one-thousandth to one ten-thousandth of the old product. Chen Mingjin, a carpenter at the China Automatic Telecommunications Equipment Factory, is an amateur radio enthusiast. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the collective, he recently developed a cutting-edge product in the field of radio. In order to climb this peak, this young man, who had only attended junior high school, read 120 books and magazines related to radio in Russian, English, and Japanese within a year.

Innovation has become a need in people's lives, a conscious, pleasant, and creative labor. Great ideals generate great actions. Once people understand the masses' desire to change the backward state of affairs, scale peaks, and win glory for the motherland, it is not difficult to understand why they are so dedicated, working day and night. Many workers are obsessed, building models with chopsticks while eating, unconsciously bumping into telephone poles while thinking about innovations, and drawing innovation diagrams even in the toilet. They capture creative inspiration everywhere. Children swinging, athletes playing on rings, "golf" games on the roadside, weighing vegetables in small markets, making cakes in cake shops, the pumps used to unblock toilets, patterns on matchboxes, and other ordinary life phenomena and small things all touch the minds of those who are interested. Xu Dingnan, a worker at the Shanghai Motor Factory, wanted to create a detector for vertical lathe processing. Lying on the lower bunk of a bunk bed, he couldn't sleep all night. Suddenly, he was inspired by the vibration of the iron sheet on the bed, found a solution, and immediately jumped up and shouted: "The key is found, the key is found!" Ji Wenhu, a worker from the same factory, was watching a movie in the auditorium. The screen showed an electric shovel digging coal in an open-pit coal mine, the claws of the excavator opening and closing. At this moment, he suddenly exclaimed "Ah!" and stood up from his seat, unable to watch any longer, and rushed back to the workshop to work on his unloading bin. The unloading bin also had a door at the bottom like an excavator, and when the door opened, all the loaded parts were unloaded, which was ten times more efficient than manual labor and also saved labor. Wang Yuandi, a female inspector at the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 20, is researching a machine to replace manual rope inspection. In order to be able to inspect the entire circumference of the rope, a rope twisting device is needed. One night, she was lying in bed and suddenly thought of the movement of the train traction shaft, which went up and down like a rope twisting motion. So, she couldn't wait until dawn and ran to the station from a very far place, watched several trains in a row, and finally got enlightened. Soon, a machine that could inspect five ropes at the same time was successful, improving efficiency by one and a half times. As the saying goes: "You search far and wide for what is right in front of you." This "right in front of you" seems "accidental," but it is often the result of a long "search far and wide," the result of a person's constant thoughts.

The heat wave of the technological revolution has crossed the boundaries of factories and penetrated into all aspects of social life, and new things like "family three-way combinations" have sprung up everywhere. People not only engage in three-way combinations of leading cadres, workers, and technicians in factories, and not only engage in three-way combinations of factories, schools, and scientific research departments; but also in their homes, husbands, wives, and children are also combined to engage in innovation. Many male workers design at home, their sons help draw diagrams, and their wives help make models. Many female workers bring their husbands to the factory on Sundays to help. Qin Yuzhen, an elderly female worker at the Yisheng Rubber Factory, specially invited her son-in-law to her home to help her draw a diagram of an "automatic rubber shoe brushing machine." Female worker Liao Lanying even rushed to Suzhou to ask her younger brother to draw blueprints for a "shoe upper stitching machine" and a "shoe mouth pulling machine." Ju Cainu, an old female worker at the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, did not forget to innovate even when she was sick at home. She thought, why can white cotton be sucked away by a cotton suction device, but why can't oil and dust be sucked away? She designed at home and asked her thirteen-year-old son to be her assistant. But the child was not familiar with mechanical forms, and the workshop could not let children enter casually, so she took the opportunity to see a doctor and asked her son to help her enter the workshop to observe. With the shadow in the child's heart, he went to the clinic to see a doctor and get medicine, and asked the pharmacist for a paper box for medicine, and went back to help his mother make a model. When Ju Cainu recovered from her illness and went to work on the third day, she brought the model of the equipment that could suck both white cotton and oil and dust to the workshop.

The heat wave of the technological revolution has also broken through old traditions and old habits, and new styles have emerged. When people visit relatives and friends, discussing and studying technological innovations has become an important part of the conversation. Many workers spend their holidays engaged in technological revolution activities. During this year's Spring Festival, the city and district's nineteen technological innovation and technological revolution exhibitions were even more lively than usual. The masses used this great opportunity to flock to "learn from experience and contribute treasures," attracting more than 400,000 people in four days. They felt that it was more interesting and meaningful than strolling down the street or going to the theater. Wives encouraged their husbands, mothers urged their sons to engage in innovation, and some neighbors also came to help. A group of young people lived in a dormitory in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. In the past, they chatted idly or fooled around in the dormitory during their spare time. The torrent of the technological revolution and the moving deeds of innovation pioneers stirred up waves in their hearts, and their thoughts and lives underwent tremendous changes. They collectively formed a "Youth Precision Casting Research Group" and successfully experimented with the innovation of "no core bone for mud cores." Now, after work, they are either experimenting in the workshop or reading books and drawing diagrams in the dormitory. On Sundays, they sometimes go to see a movie collectively, and sometimes go to brother factories to learn advanced experience. In the past, some of them had insomnia due to unrequited love; now, they are so excited about the success of innovation that they cannot fall asleep.

The spirit of communist cooperation has also been further promoted. Many stories of "posting a list to seek talents and responding to every call" have spread from technological innovation and technological revolution exhibitions. In many industries, stories of "delivering treasures to the door" have also spread. Workers at the Shanghai Plastic Penholder Factory achieved a major innovation - successfully manufacturing an automatic oil pump compression molding machine, which transformed penholder production from semi-mechanical and manual operation to one person operating with a button, increasing labor productivity by more than two times. In order to enable others to quickly realize this innovation, they specially organized a "treasure delivery team" to visit nine factories in the same industry to deliver treasures door-to-door, so that this innovation could quickly blossom and bear fruit. The "treasure delivery team" was composed of designers, electrical workers, and compression molding workers, so that when they went to brother factories, they could meet face-to-face, specifically introduce experience, and help solve difficulties. Between factories and factories, workshops and workshops, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals, around the requirements of technological innovation, in terms of technology, raw materials, and the processing of innovation projects, they help each other and exchange what they have. The scope, form, and content of cooperation have undergone major new developments. It has not only developed from the exchange of general technical experience to helping each other solve technical problems; but also from technical cooperation between enterprises to cooperation across the entire industry, from cooperation within the industry to cooperation between factories, schools, and scientific research departments, forming a new atmosphere of social cooperation.

Faced with so many magnificent and moving scenes, how can people not sing and cheer! Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line have mobilized the revolutionary consciousness of the broad masses, brought into play the subjective initiative of people, and made the intelligence and talent hidden in the masses burst out, like the waters of the Yangtze River, rushing down a thousand miles.

    上海工人阶级共产主义思想红花盛开
    革新成风  助人为乐
    闹革新，已成为人们生活的一种需要，成为一种自觉的愉快的创造性的劳动
    大协作，已在一个工厂、整个行业以及工厂、学校和科学部门之间形成风气
    新华社上海6日电　本社记者贺昌华报道：技术革新和技术革命风暴正席卷上海这个大工业城市。在这一风暴中，上海工人阶级表现了空前的雄心壮志和敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。共产主义思想在人的意识中蓬勃增长，它势如破竹地摧毁着旧的思想残余和习惯势力，日新月异地刷新着劳动和生产面貌。新时代出现的新风格，这正是当前大好形势最鲜明的特色。
    上海广大工人群众在贯彻总路线的伟大实践中，充分认识了自己的力量。他们雄心更大，志气更高，不满足现在的生产技术水平，决心以最高的速度改变它的面貌，攀登高峰。从钢铁、翻砂、加工、装配、包装各个主要环节，直到千百年来都是拼体力和手工操作的搬运装卸、缝纫刺绣、洗衣绱鞋、做饭切菜……，人们都在欢天喜地大搞机械化半机械化。从老工人到艺徒，从男工到女工，人人起来自觉地革笨重劳动和手工操作的命。许多工厂都是90％以上的人投入了革命的洪流。群众把这场革命，称之为政治上、经济上翻身以后的“第二次解放”。国营上海自行车厂过去电镀，工人身围棉皮裙、脚穿橡皮靴，手提二十几斤重的零件，八小时在车间里走二十几里，劳动强度高，劳动条件也差；现在，他们制造出了大型联合自动电镀机，情况就完全改变了。成串挂好的零件在一个槽子镀好后，自动升起，移到下一个槽子里。一位电镀工人为了庆祝自己的“解放”，买了一颗红五角星嵌在自动电镀机上。运输工人2月头二十天革了一个命，重要铁路货运站出现了“扒杆成林，吊机成网，绞车成套，小车成串”的壮丽场景。厂内运输工人纷纷丢掉杠棒，使用上了机器。杨浦棉纺织印染厂老年搬运工也“有志不在年高”，发出豪言壮语：誓叫杠棒先退休，为社会主义再干十年。包装女工定要手不伤筋、不起泡，生产成倍跳，在男工的帮助下，试制成功了包装香烟、糖果、牙膏、冷霜、火柴、缝衣针等二十几种轻工业产品的机器，双手大解放。甚至，绣花女工也拿起扳头、锉刀，实现了绣花电动化。
    愈来愈多的人为了迎头赶上世界先进水平，正在百折不挠地攀登科学技术的高峰。他们说：“人家有的，我们要有；人家没有的，我们来创造！”有些尖端产品他们见也没有见过，经过大胆设想、刻苦钻研，终于创造出来了。沪光科学仪器厂的王林鹤，经过三百七十一次试验，制成了检验高压电路绝缘材料性能的“眼睛”——高压电桥。现在，到处出现了许许多多王林鹤式的人物。就在王林鹤所在的工厂，有四个普通青年女工，经过五百八十次校验，试制成功一套“精密标准自感量”，精密度从老产品的千分之一提高到万分之一。中国自动电讯器材厂有一个木工叫陈铭津，是一个无线电业余爱好者，他在党的领导和集体的支援下，最近制成了一种无线电方面的尖端产品。为了攀登这一高峰，这个过去只上过高小的年青人，一年之内看了一百二十本包括俄文、英文和日文的有关无线电的书籍杂志。
    革新已经成为人们生活的一种需要，成为一种自觉的愉快的创造性劳动。伟大的理想产生了伟大的行动，人们了解了群众那种要求改变落后面貌、攀登高峰为祖国争光的心情，就不难理解为什么他们那样废寝忘食、梦寐以求了。很多工人像着了迷一样，吃饭时用筷子搭模型，走路时想着革新不知不觉撞上了电线杆，上厕所也在画革新图样。他们到处捕捉创造的启示。小孩荡秋千、运动员玩吊环，马路边的“高尔夫”球游戏，小菜场秤小菜，糕团店做糕团，通抽水马桶用的泵浦，火柴盒上的图案等等平淡无奇的生活现象和细小事物，都触动了那些有心人的灵机。上海电机厂工人许定南要创造一台立车加工的检调器，躺在双层床的下铺上，一夜没有睡着；忽然从床上铁皮的动荡得到启发，找到了解决的办法，马上爬起来大喊：“关键找着了，关键找着了！”同一个厂的工人季文虎，坐在大礼堂里看电影，银幕上映出了露天煤矿的电铲掘煤，掘斗的爪子一张一合。此刻，他忽然“呵”地一声叫起来，从座位上立起，顾不得再看下去，赶回车间去搞起自己的卸料箱来。卸料箱也像掘斗一样下面开了门，一开门装的零件统统卸了出来，比原来人工效率高十倍，还节省了劳动力。国棉二十厂检验女工王媛娣，正在研究代替手工检验绳子的机器，为了能检验绳子的整个圆周，需要有一个搓绳装置。一天夜里，她睡在床上，忽然想起火车牵引轴的动作，一上一下地很像搓绳的动作。于是她来不及等到天亮，从很远地方跑到车站，一连看了好几列火车，果然开了窍。不久，一台能同时检验五根绳子的机器成功了，效率提高一倍半。俗语说：“踏破铁鞋无觅处，得来全不费功夫。”这个“得来全不费功夫”，看上去是“偶然的”，却往往经过了一个长期的“踏破铁鞋”的过程，正是一个有心人日思夜想的结果。
    技术革命的热浪，跨出了工厂的范围，渗透到社会生活的各个方面，到处涌出了“家庭三结合”的新鲜事。人们不仅在厂内搞领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合，不仅在工厂、学校和科学研究部门搞三结合；而且在家里，丈夫、妻子和儿女也结合起来搞革新。很多男工在家里设计，儿子帮助画图，妻子帮助做模型。很多女工星期天把丈夫带到厂里来帮忙。义生橡胶厂老年女工秦玉珍，特地把女婿找到家里来，帮她画“胶鞋自动刷浆机”的图。女工廖兰英还特地赶到苏州去，请弟弟画“绱鞋面机”和“拉鞋口线机”的图纸。国棉一厂细纱老女工居财女病在家里也不忘革新。她想，为什么白花可以用吸棉器吸尽，但为什么油花、灰尘不能吸掉？她就在家里搞设计，要十三岁的儿子作助手。可是小孩子不熟悉机械形式，车间又不能随便放小孩进去，她就借看病的机会，要儿子扶她进车间观摩。孩子心中有了影子，到医务室看病取药时又向药剂师要来一只装药的纸盒，回去帮助母亲搞起模型来。当第三天居财女病愈上工，就把既能吸白花又能吸油花、灰尘的设备模型带来车间了。
    技术革命的热浪，也冲破了旧传统旧习惯，出现了新风尚。人们走亲戚、看朋友，交谈和研究技术革新也成了一个重要内容。很多工人的假日，是在搞技术革命的活动中度过的。今年春节，市、区十九个技术革新技术革命展览会显得比平时更加热闹。群众利用这个大好时机，蜂涌前往“取经献宝”，四天之内吸引了四十多万人次。他们感到比逛马路、上戏院过得更有兴趣，更有意思。妻子勉励丈夫、母亲叮咛儿子要好好搞革新，有的邻居也过来帮忙。上海机床厂有一个宿舍里住了一群青年，过去，业余时间在宿舍里扯闲谈，或者打打闹闹。技术革命的洪流和革新闯将的动人事迹激起了他们心头的浪花，他们的思想和生活发生了极大的变化。他们集体成立了“青年精密铸造研究小组”，试验成功了“泥芯不用芯骨”的革新。现在，一下班，不是在车间里作试验，就是在宿舍里看书、画图样。星期天，有时集体去看场电影，有时到兄弟厂去学习先进经验。过去，他们中间有人曾经为失恋而失眠过；现在，他们为了革新的成功而兴奋得不能入眠。
    共产主义大协作的精神也进一步发扬起来了。技术革新技术革命展览会上传出了许多“出榜求贤、一呼百应”的故事。在很多行业中，还传出了“送宝上门”的故事。上海塑料笔杆一厂职工实现了一项重大革新——制造成功自动油泵压塑车，使笔杆生产由半机械和手工操作变成为一个人用电钮操作，劳动生产率提高两倍多。他们为了别人也能很快实现这项革新，专门组织了“送宝队”，到九家同业工厂去挨户送宝，使这项革新迅速地开花结果了。“送宝队”由设计人员、电气工人和压塑工人组成，以便到兄弟厂时，可以互相对口，具体介绍经验和帮助解决困难。在工厂与工厂、车间与车间、小组与小组、个人与个人之间，围绕技术革新的要求，在技术、原材料、革新项目的加工等方面，都互相帮助，互通有无。协作的范围、形式和内容，有了重大的新发展。不仅从一般技术经验的交流发展到互相帮助解决技术关键；而且从企业之间的技术协作发展到全行业的协作，从工业内部的协作发展到工厂、学校和科学研究部门的协作，形成了全社会大协作的新风气。
    面对着这许多壮丽、动人的情景，人们怎能不歌唱，怎能不欢呼！毛泽东思想和总路线调动了广大群众的革命自觉，发挥了人的主观能动作用，使蕴藏在群众中的聪明才智，迸发出来，有如长江之水，一泻千里。
