Joyfully Reading "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," Volume 3
Compiled by the Editorial Committee of "Thirty Years of the Chinese People's Liberation Army"  Published by People's Literature Publishing House  Peng Ming

The newly published "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," Volume 3, is a special collection about the Long March of the Red Army. The book consists of seventy articles, all written by people who personally experienced the Long March. Some of the authors were high-ranking commanders of the Red Army at the time, some were soldiers in companies, some were political workers, and some were supply workers and cooks. The authors belonged to the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army. The editors have systematically arranged these various recollections from different angles and aspects according to the Red Army's line of march. Starting with Comrade Liu Bocheng's "Recalling the Long March," a relatively comprehensive discussion of the Long March, and ending with "Remembering the Meeting of the Three Major Red Armies," the seventy articles can be read separately to understand individual heroic battles; read together, they can provide a more systematic knowledge of the world-renowned Long March.

This is a good book, with many advantages in its writing and editing. Its content is informative, moving, and heart-stirring. Here, I would like to share some of my thoughts after reading it.

First, it embodies the greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought.

As everyone knows, the Zunyi Conference was the most important turning point in the Red Army's Long March and the Chinese revolution. Before this, the erroneous line had led the Red Army into extremely difficult situations, causing great losses; after the Zunyi Conference established the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, the Red Army was saved and went from victory to victory. Many parts of the book contain profound and vivid descriptions of the Red Army's situation before and after the Zunyi Conference, the soldiers' emotions, and Chairman Mao's military line, which enable people to specifically understand the infinite vitality of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Liu Bocheng said in "Recalling the Long March": "The spirit of the Zunyi Conference spread to the troops, and the whole army was invigorated, as if the heavy fog had been cleared away and they had seen the sunshine, sweeping away all doubts and dissatisfactions";
	"After the Zunyi Conference, our army reversed its previous situation, as if it had suddenly gained new life, maneuvering and interspersing among the enemy, pretending to go east but actually going west, pretending to cross the river to the north but actually launching a long-distance counterattack, taking the initiative everywhere, vigorous and lively, controlling the enemy." (Pages 5, 6) Comrade Zhang Aiping, in "From Zunyi to the Dadu River," also used extremely vivid facts to demonstrate his conclusion: "From Zunyi to the victorious crossing of the Dadu River and the meeting with the Fourth Front Army, was the most critical and decisive stage of the Central Red Army's 25,000-li Long March. It was also the most active stage of the Red Army's Long March. It is the most glorious example in the history of warfare. Without the victory of this stage, it would have been difficult for the Red Army to turn danger into safety, and it would have been impossible to finally complete the great strategic task of going north to resist Japan. This great victory was mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao after the Zunyi Conference, and Chairman Mao's command, which was like a divine prediction, completely placing the enemy under his control, and adopting a mobile and flexible large-scale movement warfare strategy and tactics. This is the victory of the Zunyi Conference of the Party Central Committee! It is the victory of Chairman Mao's military thought!" (Pages 77, 78)

After the Zunyi Conference, another key issue during the Long March was the debate over the marching route after the meeting of the First and Fourth Front Armies. The Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao insisted on the route of going north to resist Japan, while Zhang Guotao, who was working in the Fourth Front Army at the time, insisted on the route of fleeing south. The debate over the two routes was related to the fate of the Red Army's Long March. As Chairman Mao said, "If we turn our heads and flee south, it would be a betrayal of the revolution." (Page 171)

Due to Zhang Guotao's criminal activities, some of the Red Army suffered setbacks, but due to the struggle waged by the broad masses of commanders and fighters under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's route of going north to resist Japan finally won a complete victory. Thus, Mao Zedong Thought once again saved the Red Army. This thought of Chairman Mao is specifically recorded in the book. Comrade Yang Chengwu's "Chairman Mao Instructed Us to Cross the Grasslands" recounts Chairman Mao's instruction: "We can only move forward. The enemy judges that we will go east to Sichuan and dare not risk taking this step of crossing the grasslands and going north to Shaanxi and Gansu. However, the enemy can never figure out our bottom line. We must take the path that the enemy thinks we dare not take." (Page 171) Chairman Mao also said: "The most fundamental way to overcome difficulties is to explain clearly to the comrades all the difficulties we may encounter, and to explain clearly to the comrades why the Central Committee has decided to cross the grasslands and go north to resist Japan. As long as the comrades understand these things, I believe that no difficulties can stop the Red Army commanders and fighters." (Pages 171, 172) Relying on Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, the Red Army overcame numerous difficulties, completed the great Long March, and enabled the entire army to gain unparalleled confidence in victory, as Chairman Mao said in his poem "The Long March": "The Three Armies marched past, all faces smiling." History proves that the victory of the Long March is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, we have achieved great victories in the Long March and subsequent struggles; in the future, as long as we unswervingly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we will certainly achieve even greater victories.

Second, it demonstrates the heroic spirit and revolutionary optimism of the Red Army.

The hardships and obstacles encountered by the Red Army during the Long March were unprecedented. However, all the hardships and obstacles were overcome by the commanders and fighters of the Red Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In this book, the authors, through their personal experiences, vividly describe the heroic deeds of the Red Army commanders and fighters in breaking through barriers, seizing passes, rushing to dangerous crossings, scaling snow-capped mountains, and crossing grasslands, demonstrating the heroic spirit of "The Red Army fears not the trials of a distant march; to them a thousand mountains, ten thousand rivers, are nothing." The heroic deeds of the Red Army are countless; here, only one example is given: the Red Army traveled 240 li in one day when seizing the Luding Bridge, which shows how extraordinary they were. Walking 240 li in one day is not something that ordinary people can do. However, this day was not an ordinary day, but a day of fighting and marching at the same time, encountering "heavy rain, lightning and thunder, and darkness so complete that one could not see one's fingers." It was under such circumstances that the Red Army, with extraordinary heroism, traveled 240 li in one day and immediately went into battle to seize the Luding Iron Chain Bridge. In addition, the well-known deeds that have been circulated among the people, such as cleverly crossing the Jinsha River and rushing across the Dadu River, are also specifically and vividly described in the book. The book not only portrays the Red Army soldiers' bravery and tenacity, but also demonstrates the Red Army soldiers' alertness and wisdom, and also illustrates the enemy's corruption and incompetence. "Seizing Zunyi by Wisdom" and "Setting Up a Camp Team" are articles about this aspect.

A friend in need is a friend indeed. Among the Red Army commanders and fighters armed with proletarian ideology under the leadership of the Party, it can be said that there is the deepest friendship. The care of superiors for subordinates, the love of subordinates for superiors, especially the spirit of class friendship shown in the difficult and dangerous situations of the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, is something that is difficult to calm down after reading. As many authors in the book say: "The Long March is unforgettable, and the love between comrades in the Long March is even more unforgettable." (Page 412) "If someone asks me: What is the deepest thing you experienced during the Long March? I would not hesitate to answer him: It is the flesh-and-blood class friendship of the Red Army." (Page 194) Let this spirit be further promoted! Let this spirit always inspire the younger generation to tirelessly struggle for the lofty cause of building socialism and realizing communism!

Third, it illustrates the Red Army's flesh-and-blood ties with the masses.

From the Sanwan Reorganization in September and October 1927, Chairman Mao stipulated new principles for building the army for the Red Army, explaining the close relationship between the Red Army under the leadership of the Party and the masses. In December 1929, Chairman Mao pointed out in the resolution of the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army: "The Red Army's fighting is not simply for fighting, but for publicizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses build revolutionary power. Separated from the goals of publicizing, organizing, arming the masses and building revolutionary power, it loses the meaning of fighting, and it also loses the meaning of the Red Army's existence."
	("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 1, Page 88)

This principle regarding the relationship between the Red Army and the masses was not only adhered to in the construction of the base areas and the Red Army's anti-encirclement struggles, but also throughout the Long March. Countless examples show that whenever the Red Army arrived in a new area, the masses initially showed fear and even fled due to being deceived by propaganda, but after the Red Army's propaganda and education and the proof of the Red Army's actions, the masses became aware. The awakened masses showed unparalleled love for the Red Army; when the Red Army left, the masses were always reluctant to part, and some even shed tears. In this regard, there are also many moving descriptions in the book. In particular, the Red Army soldiers' strict adherence to mass discipline in the face of hunger and starvation highlights their noble qualities. As Comrade Ren Bishi, political commissar of the Second Front Army of the Red Army, said at the time: "Hunger cannot starve out our heart to serve the masses. Everyone must protect the interests of the masses, and not even a single blade of grass or tree can be violated!" (Page 298) It was this noble quality that forged a flesh-and-blood relationship between the Red Army and the masses, and enabled them to stand invincible.

The Red Army's Long March passed through many areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Every time they passed through such areas, the Red Army investigated local customs and habits and conducted widespread education on ethnic policies for the soldiers. Relying on the Party's correct ethnic policies, the Red Army smoothly passed through many difficult-to-pass areas. The story of Comrade Liu Bocheng forming an alliance with the Yi ethnic group leader has been circulating among the people for a long time. Comrade Xiao Hua's "Passing Through the Greater Liang Mountains" provides a specific introduction to the situation at the time. The author vividly describes the scene of the alliance, saying: "No incense, no candles, facing the blue sky and clear water; what dominates this alliance is the sincere heart of unity between fraternal ethnic groups."
	(Page 130) It was by relying on this sincerity that the Red Army received powerful help in the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and left a profound impact among the people of all ethnic groups.

"A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," Volume 3, has a total of more than 320,000 words. The above three points do not fully summarize the whole book; the facts cited are only one or two of the thousands of examples. Chairman Mao once said when summarizing the significance of the Long March: "The Long March is the first of its kind in the records of history, it is a manifesto, a propaganda force, and a sowing machine. Since Pan Gu separated heaven and earth, from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to today, has there ever been such a Long March in history? In the twelve months, dozens of planes in the sky scouted and bombed every day, hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground surrounded and intercepted, and we encountered countless hardships and obstacles on the road, but we started everyone's two feet and drove more than 20,000 li, traversing eleven provinces. May I ask if there has ever been such a Long March in history? No, never. The Long March is also a manifesto. It declares to the world that the Red Army are heroes, and the imperialists and their running dogs, such as Chiang Kai-shek, are completely useless. The Long March declared the bankruptcy of the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement and suppression. The Long March is also a propaganda force. It announced to about 200 million people in eleven provinces that only the Red Army's road is the road to liberate them. If it were not for this one move, how could such a large number of people know so quickly that there is such a great truth as the Red Army in the world? The Long March is also a sowing machine. It has scattered many seeds in eleven provinces, sprouting, growing leaves, blooming, and bearing fruit, and there will be harvests in the future. In short, the Long March ended with the result of our victory and the enemy's failure." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 1, Page 145) History has proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment. The Long March has long made the revolution blossom and bear fruit. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Now that this book specifically recording the Long March has been published, we can also say that this is a textbook for educating the younger generation. Just as the Long March sprouted, grew leaves, bloomed, and bore fruit in the Chinese revolution, this book will also sprout, grow leaves, bloom, and bear fruit in the younger generation. The younger generation will learn and master Mao Zedong Thought better from it, inherit the glorious tradition of the Long March, and make greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction.

    喜读“星火燎原”第三集
    “中国人民解放军三十年”征文编辑委员会编  人民文学出版社出版  彭明
    新近出版的“星火燎原”第三集，是关于红军长征的专集。全书由七十篇文章组成，作者都是长征的亲身经历者。作者中，有的是当时红军的高级指挥员，有的是连队里的战士，有的是政治工作人员，也有的是供给工作人员和炊事员。作者当时分别属于红军一、二、四各个方面军。编辑工作者把这些从不同角度、不同方面的种种回忆，按照红军行进的路线，加以有条理地安排。卷首以刘伯承同志的比较全面论述长征的“回顾长征”一文始，卷末以“记三大红军会师”一文终。这样，七十篇文章分别来读，可以了解各个独立的英雄战斗事迹；联系起来读，又可以对举世闻名的长征获得比较系统的知识。
    这是一本好书，它的写作和编辑有着许多优点，它的内容翔实动人，感人肺腑。在这里，仅谈谈自己读后的一些体会。
    第一，体现了毛泽东思想的伟大、正确。
    如大家所知，遵义会议是红军长征和中国革命的一个最重要的转折点。在此以前，错误路线曾把红军带入极端艰险的境地，使红军受到极大的损失；而在遵义会议确立了以毛主席为首的党中央的领导以后，红军就得到了挽救，并由此从胜利走向胜利。本书中的许多篇幅，对于红军在遵义会议前后所处的境况、战士的情绪以及毛主席的军事路线，都有着深刻生动的描述，这些描述令人具体地懂得了毛泽东思想的无穷活力。刘伯承同志在“回顾长征”一文中说：“遵议会议的精神传达到部队中，全军振奋，好像拨开重雾，看见了阳光，一切疑虑不满的情绪一扫而光”；
    “遵义会议以后，我军一反以前的情况，好像忽然获得了新的生命，迂回曲折，穿插于敌人之间，以为我向东却又向西，以为我渡江北上却又远途回击，处处主动，生龙活虎，左右敌人。”（第五、六页）张爱萍同志在“从遵义到大渡河”一文中，也以极其生动的事实，论证了他的下述结语：“从遵义到胜利地渡过大渡河与四方面军会师，是中央红军二万五千里长征途中最关紧要的带有决定意义的阶段。也是红军长征中行动最积极、最活跃的阶段。是战争史上最光辉的范例。没有这个阶段的胜利，红军就难于转危为安，就不可能最后完成北上抗日的伟大战略任务。这个伟大的胜利，主要是由于遵义会议后，红军有了以毛主席为首的党中央正确领导和毛主席在指挥上料敌如神，完全置敌于自己掌握之中，并采取了机动灵活的大规模的运动战的战略战术。这是党中央遵义会议的胜利！是毛主席军事思想的胜利！”（第七七、七八页）
    遵义会议以后，长征途中的另一个关键问题，是一、四方面军会师后的进军路线争论问题。以毛主席为首的中央坚持北上抗日的路线，而当时在四方面军工作的张国焘却坚持南下逃跑的路线。两条路线的争论，关系到红军长征的命运，如毛主席所说：“如果我们掉头南下就是逃跑，就会断送革命。”（第一七一页）
    由于张国焘的罪恶活动，一部分红军受到挫折，但是由于广大指战员在毛泽东思想指导下所进行的斗争，毛主席的北上抗日路线终于获得了全部的胜利。这样，毛泽东思想就再一次挽救了红军。毛主席的这一思想，在书中有着具体的记载。杨成武同志的“毛主席指示我们过草地”一文，记述了毛主席的这一指示：“我们只有前进。敌人判断我们会东出四川，不敢冒险走横跨草地、北出陕、甘的这一着棋。但是，敌人是永远摸不到我们的底的，我们偏要走敌人认为不敢走的道路。”（第一七一页）毛主席又说：“克服困难最根本的办法，是把可能碰到的一切困难向同志们讲清楚，把中央为什么决定要过草地北上抗日的道理向同志们讲清楚。只要同志们明确了这些，我相信没有什么困难能挡得住红军指战员的。”（第一七一、一七二页）依靠了毛主席的英明指示，红军克服了重重的困难，完成了伟大的长征，并使全军战士获得了无比的胜利信心，正如毛主席的“长征”诗中所说：“三军过后尽开颜”。历史证明，长征的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。过去，依据毛泽东思想的指导，已经取得了长征及其以后各次斗争的伟大胜利；今后，只要坚持不渝地掌握毛泽东思想，我们就一定会取得更伟大的胜利。
    第二，表现了红军的英雄气概和革命的乐观主义。
    红军长征遇到的艰难险阻，是举世罕见的。但是，所有的一切艰难险阻，都为以毛泽东思想武装起来的红军的指战员们克服了。在这本书中，作者通过自己的亲身经历，生动地描写了红军指战员斩关夺隘、抢险飞渡、翻越雪山、跨过草地的英雄事迹，表现出“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的英雄气魄。红军的英雄事迹，举不胜举；这里仅仅指出红军飞夺泸定桥时一天赶完二百四十里路程的一例，就可见一斑了。一天之内，走完二百四十里，这不是普通人所能做到的。但是，这一天又不是普通的一天，而是一边战斗一边行军，同时遇到了“大雨倾盆，电闪雷鸣，天黑得伸手不见五指”的一天。就是在这样的情况下，红军以非凡的英雄气概，一天走完了二百四十里，并立即转入战斗夺取了泸定铁索桥。此外，在民间传诵已久的，如巧渡金沙江、抢渡大渡河等等事迹，书中也都有具体生动的描述。书中不仅刻划了红军战士的英勇顽强，而且表现了红军战士的机警和智慧，同时也说明了敌人的腐败无能。“智取遵义”、“设营队”等文，就是关于这一方面的叙述。
    患难见知交。在党的领导下为无产阶级思想所武装起来的红军指战员之间，可以说是最深厚的知交了。上级对下级的照顾，下级对上级的爱护，特别是在雪山草地的艰险境地所表现出的阶级友爱精神，是令人读过之后久久难以平静的。正如书中的许多作者所说：“长征是难忘的，长征中的同志之间的爱更是难忘的。”（第四一二页）“若有人问我：你在长征途中体会最深的东西是什么？我会毫不迟疑地回答他说：是红军的那种骨肉般的阶级友爱精神。”（第一九四页）让这种精神更加发扬光大吧！让这种精神永远地鼓舞着青年一代，加速地为建成社会主义和实现共产主义的崇高事业而不懈地奋斗吧！
    第三，说明了红军和人民群众的血肉联系。
    从1927年9、10月间三湾改编起，毛主席就给红军规定了新式的建军原则，说明了在党领导下的红军和人民群众的密切关系。1929年12月，毛主席在红四军第九次党的代表大会的决议中又指出：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”
    （“毛泽东选集”，第一卷，第八八页）
    关于红军同群众关系的这条原则，不仅在根据地建设和红军的反围攻斗争中坚持着，而且在长征过程中也始终坚持着。无数的事例说明：红军每到一个新地区，群众由于受到欺骗宣传开始表现了恐惧甚至逃跑，而经过了红军的宣传教育以及红军行动的证明，群众就觉悟了。觉悟了的群众，对红军表现了无比的热爱；在红军离开时，群众总是依依不舍，有的甚至涔涔泪下。在这方面，书中也有很多动人的描述。特别是红军战士在忍饥挨饿的情况下，对于群众纪律的严格遵守，突出地表现了他们的高贵品质。正如当时红二方面军政治委员任弼时同志所说：“饿肚饿不掉我们为群众服务的这颗心，大家一定要维护群众利益，一草一木也不能侵犯！”（第二九八页）正是这种高贵品质，使红军和人民群众结成了血肉一般的关系，而使自己立于不败之地。
    红军长征，经过了许多少数民族地区。每经过这种地区时，红军都调查了当地的风俗习惯，向战士们普遍地进行了民族政策的教育。依靠党的正确的民族政策，红军顺利地通过了许多难以通过的地区。刘伯承同志和彝族首领结盟的故事，是在民间传诵已久的。萧华同志的“通过大凉山”一文，对于当时经过有着具体的介绍。作者生动地描述结盟的情景说：“不用香，不用烛，面对着蔚蓝的天和清明的水；主宰这个盟誓的是兄弟民族团结的赤诚。”
  （第一三零页）正是靠了这种赤诚，红军在少数民族地区得到了有力的帮助，在各族人民间留下了深远的影响。
    “星火燎原”第三集，全书共三十二万多字。以上三点，远远没有概括书的全貌；所举事实，更不过是千百事例中之一二。毛主席在总结长征的意义时曾经说：“长征是历史纪录上的第一次，长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。自从盘古开天地，三皇五帝到于今，历史上曾经有过我们这样的长征么？十二个月光阴中间，天上每日几十架飞机侦察轰炸，地下几十万大军围追堵截，路上遇着了说不尽的艰难险阻，我们却开动了每人的两只脚，长驱二万余里，纵横十一个省。请问历史上曾有过我们这样的长征么？没有，从来没有的。长征又是宣言书。它向全世界宣告，红军是英雄好汉，帝国主义者和他们的走狗蒋介石等辈则是完全无用的。长征宣告了帝国主义和蒋介石围追堵截的破产。长征又是宣传队。它向十一个省内大约两万万人民宣布，只有红军的道路，才是解放他们的道路。不因此一举，那么广大的民众怎会如此迅速地知道世界上还有红军这样一篇大道理呢？长征又是播种机。它散布了许多种子在十一个省内，发芽、长叶、开花、结果，将来是会有收获的。总而言之，长征是以我们胜利、敌人失败的结果而告结束。”（“毛泽东选集”，第一卷，第一四五页）历史证明了毛主席论断的正确，长征早已使革命开花、结果了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。现在，这本专门记述长征的书出版了，我们也可以说，这是一本教育青年一代的教科书。如同长征在中国革命中发芽、长叶、开花、结果一样，这本书也会在青年一代中发芽、长叶、开花、结果的。青年一代将从中更好地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，继承长征的光荣传统，在社会主义建设的事业中作出更巨大的贡献。
