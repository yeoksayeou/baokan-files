The Revolutionary Significance of Rice Transplanters
Liu RuiLong, Vice Minister of Agriculture

In 1956, China's first rice transplanter model appeared. Over the past four years, continuous experimentation and research have led to initial success. At the Seventh National Rice Transplanter Appraisal Meeting, 84 types of rice transplanters were selected from various regions. The "Hunan Liling No. 2," "Jiangxi-59 type," "Guangxi 59-3 type," "Shanghai Nanhui No. 1," "Hubei Hanchuan-59 type," "Zhejiang Agricultural No. 4," and "South 105-B type" were selected and determined for standardized manufacturing and promotion. Additionally, 14 other types were recommended for trial use nationwide.

Rice transplanters come in a wide variety of types: some are "native," such as the "Hunan Liling No. 2"; some are semi-native and semi-foreign, such as the "Jiangxi-59 type," "Guangxi 59-3 type," "Shanghai Nanhui No. 1," and "Hubei Hanchuan-59 type"; and some are "foreign," such as the "South 105-B type" (the terms "native" and "foreign" are used in a relative sense, meaning some are simpler, while others are more complex). The transplanting methods include direct insertion, roller insertion, and clamp insertion. In terms of power, there are manual, animal-powered, and mechanically powered options. This diversity allows different regions to choose according to their local conditions and needs.

The standardized and promoted rice transplanters have reached a new level of technology.

First, the quality of transplanting is good and meets agricultural technical requirements. The spacing between holes transplanted by machine is uniform, ensuring reasonable close planting. The depth of seedlings transplanted by machine is consistent, with an insertion depth of about four to five centimeters. The shortcomings of past transplanter operations, such as missed transplants, hooked seedlings, damaged seedlings, and unevenness, have now been largely resolved. The missed transplant rate is as low as 1% and as high as 5%. The hooked seedling rate is as low as 2% and as high as over 30%. The damaged seedling rate is less than 1% in some cases and 8% in others. Uniformity reaches 90% in good cases and 60% or 70% in poor cases. Machine-transplanted rice has small holes and fewer footprints in the field, and the seedlings are exposed to the sun for a shorter time after being pulled out. There are no wrapped heart seedlings during transplanting. All of these are beneficial to the growth and development of rice.

Second, transplanting efficiency is high. At a density of 30,000 holes per mu, manual transplanting can only cover half a mu per day. Using the Liling simple transplanter, three to four mu can be transplanted per day. With the "Jiangxi-59 type" or "Guangxi 59-3 type," five to seven mu can be transplanted per day. With the "South 105-B type," up to about 30 mu can be transplanted per day. Machine transplanting increases efficiency by several times, ten times, or even dozens of times compared to manual transplanting.

Third, the machine body is sturdy, and the parts are firm. This is the result of continuous improvement over the years, and naturally includes the quality of manufacturing. In the past, rice transplanters easily deformed after being immersed in water and exposed to the sun, and could not be used for a long time. Now, many places use various methods to treat the wood, ensuring that the machine does not deform and can operate relatively durably after being submerged.

Fourth, operation is light and convenient, greatly reducing labor intensity. Women and semi-able-bodied individuals can operate them. Chen Binxiu, a female transplanting expert from You County, Hunan, initially did not believe that rice transplanters could transplant well and quickly. Later, she competed with a rice transplanter, and the result was that the rice transplanter was four times faster than her and easier to operate. From then on, she actively used rice transplanters and transformed from a manual transplanting expert into a machine transplanting expert.

Using rice transplanters for transplanting can both seize the season and ensure reasonable close planting. In 1959, the area planted with various types of rice transplanters across the country reached more than 680,000 mu. Field appraisals in large-scale trials in various regions have proven that using rice transplanters for transplanting increases production. According to statistics from 14 points in Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, and others, the increase in production from machine transplanting compared to manual transplanting is as follows: six points showed an increase of 2% to 10%, four points showed an increase of 11% to 20%, and four points showed an increase of 31% to 35%. Rice transplanters not only improve work efficiency but also increase production, making them very popular among farmers. As the farmers in Guizhou sing: "Since ancient times, transplanting by hand was considered skillful, but now machines fly through the fields, ensuring quality, quantity, and high efficiency, with no sore backs or aching legs. At first, it looks like dragons playing in the water, and in the blink of an eye, a green curtain is woven."

The successful research and popularization of rice transplanters is a major revolution in paddy field agricultural tools in our country and a major revolution in rice cultivation. This is a victory for the Party's General Line, a product of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, a product of the rural people's communes, and a product of the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The successful experimentation and widespread promotion of rice transplanters are of extremely important significance for fundamentally changing the backwardness of our country's paddy field cultivation techniques and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production. As early as July 1955, when our country's socialist transformation was not yet complete, Chairman Mao pointed out the important significance of realizing agricultural mechanization in our country. Chairman Mao said: "Only when China thoroughly completes the socialist transformation in terms of socio-economic systems, and also uses machines in all departments and places that can use machine operations, can the socio-economic outlook be completely changed." Here, Chairman Mao's great ideal of "using machines in all departments and places that can use machine operations" will be gradually realized in paddy field areas due to the promotion, popularization, and continuous improvement of rice transplanters. Nearly one-quarter of the cultivated land in our country is planted with rice. Rice cultivation includes two methods: transplanting and direct seeding. The former accounts for the vast majority of the area, while the latter is only used in a few regions. Existing experience proves that direct seeding can achieve high yields under conditions of deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, good land preparation, and careful management, but its disadvantage is the difficulty in overcoming the contradiction with the growth of the previous crop. If the previous crop is not harvested, it is impossible to sow, and in most regions, only one crop can be planted per year. In addition, row seeding has a dense spacing between plants, and weeds and seedlings grow together, making it difficult to remove weeds. In most areas of our country where land can be planted for two seasons, it is difficult to promote direct seeding in the short term. The advantages of transplanting (seedling raising and transplanting) are: during the seedling raising period in small seedling fields, other crops can still be planted in the large fields, which can economically utilize the land and increase the multiple cropping index; weeds can be effectively removed during seedling raising in seedling fields, irrigation in the main fields, and during seedling preparation and transplanting; planting at a certain hole spacing also facilitates inter-cultivation and ventilation and light transmission. Transplanting is an excellent technique in the tradition of intensive cultivation in rice production in our country, and it is also a relatively reliable method of increasing production adopted by the vast majority of regions today. However, rice transplanting has very strict requirements for the agricultural season and generally requires completion within ten days. Delays in time will reduce production. Transplanting is labor-intensive and requires a high labor intensity. Since the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the planting density of rice has increased, and the amount of labor used has also increased. Especially during the seasons of harvesting wheat and transplanting rice, and harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice, the labor force is very tight. Therefore, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of rice transplanting operations have become the urgent demand of the vast number of farmers in our country's paddy field areas.

For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have dreamed of a transplanting tool that could reduce heavy labor. During the Song Dynasty, farmers in Wuchang, Hubei, invented a type of seedling horse, and the poet Su Dongpo wrote a "Seedling Horse Song" to praise it. After the liberation of the whole country, the vast number of farmers proposed the creation of rice transplanters and attempted to create rice transplanters in many places. The Party firmly grasped this emerging trend and actively led this technological revolution movement.

From the proposal of the task to the creation of many trials to the final promotion of the rice transplanter, it has gone through countless struggles. It is necessary to fight both the difficulties caused by the lack of ready-made experience and the obstruction of right-leaning conservative thinking. Party organizations at all levels firmly support the creative activities of rice transplanter creators. The Party nurtures this new thing from all aspects. The achievements and power of the people's communes and the high-speed development of our country's socialist construction all give rice transplanter creation activities unlimited encouragement. The success of the rice transplanter has greatly enlightened people's thinking.

First, the initial success of rice transplanters proves that the mechanization of agriculture in our country can be combined with the tradition of intensive cultivation in our country, breaking the fallacy that "transplanting cannot be mechanized" that some people believed in the past. Whether the cultivation of paddy fields in the southern rice-growing areas of our country can be mechanized depends first on whether the operation of rice fields can be mechanized, and the transplanting operation, which has higher technical requirements, is just that. Once this link is broken, it opens up a smooth path for mechanized operations in paddy field areas. Most of the rice transplanters that are now standardized and promoted are still operated manually. Because they were born not long ago, it is inevitable that there will be some shortcomings. They will inevitably be continuously improved and gradually perfected in the future. In the future, with a large number of power-driven machines, transplanting operations can be relatively easily transitioned from semi-mechanization to mechanization. People who initially doubted believed that transplanting with machines was inconceivable. When the rice transplanter was initially successful, they doubted whether it could increase production. They emphasized the complexity of transplanting technology and the specificity of transplanting conditions, and emphasized that the fields were small, the roads were narrow, making it difficult to operate, and the terrain was rugged and difficult to change. It is true that transplanting operations require high technical requirements. Dividing and sending seedlings was the first difficulty encountered by all rice transplanter creators. However, the vast number of workers and farmers were not intimidated by the difficulties but persevered in their hard work, learned from each other, and worked hard to create. Among those who doubted, there were a group of intellectually lazy and cowardly people who were unwilling to learn from the masses and were unwilling to work hard. When they hit a wall, in order to cover up their intellectual poverty, they spread the fallacy that "transplanting cannot be mechanized." Comrade Lin Tiqiang, the creator of the rice transplanter, found a way to move the seedling box to divide the seedlings based on the principle of equidistant movement of typewriters. Comrade He Jisheng found the principle of clamp-type seedling dividing from the comb used for combing hair. Their conclusions contradicted the fallacy of cowards and lazy people: "Although the mechanization of transplanting is difficult, the difficulties can be overcome." Now, countless examples prove that transplanting can not only be mechanized but also increase production. The rice transplanter is not only a tool to improve labor efficiency but also a tool to increase production.

Second, the initial success of rice transplanters proves that things that have not been created or have not yet been successfully created by capitalist countries can be created and successfully created by the people of our country. Things that others have not yet done, we can also do. Once again, it severely strikes at the idea of worshipping foreigners. Although our country's agricultural mechanization level is many years behind capitalist countries, we will be able to catch up with and surpass them in a relatively short period of time. Some capitalist countries have been studying rice transplanters for many years, but have not yet succeeded. We only spent a few years to achieve initial success. What is the reason for this? First, we have the leadership of the Communist Party and the superior socialist system. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our country's workers, farmers, and intellectuals adhere to putting politics in command, breaking superstitions, emancipating their minds, and establishing a communist style of daring to think, speak, and do. In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, everyone is boldly creating and selflessly working. Everyone takes overcoming difficulties and helping others as an honor. There is centralized leadership, creation in different places, mutual learning, and mutual promotion. Therefore, success is fast. In capitalist society, everything is for profit and for individuals to get rich. They keep secrets from each other and destroy each other, so the progress is very slow. Second, precisely because our country is a socialist country, we can adopt the method of the mass line, not only with a professional research team but mainly relying on mass movements, adopting a variety of programs and methods, and conducting multi-point experimental research. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 2,000 rice transplanters being tested throughout the country. Millions of people use their brains, think about problems, come up with ideas, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and give play to collective wisdom. All the creations of rice transplanters are you in me and I in you. In this way, the difficult problems in the creation are solved one by one and batch by batch, and the rice transplanter is successfully created. In order to exchange technical research results, national and local experience exchange meetings are held regularly every year. Since 1956, seven national rice transplanter meetings have been held. This is something that capitalist countries cannot do. In the past, some bourgeois technicians believed that "capitalist countries have stronger technology than us, and they have not been able to solve the problem of rice transplanters. China's technology is backward and cannot be solved." In 1956, a rightist element in the Agricultural Tool Department of the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences tried desperately to cancel the rice transplanter research project based on this absurd argument, fully demonstrating the slavish thoughts of these people.

Third, the fact that rice transplanters have initially succeeded proves that the vast number of workers and farmers are able to climb the peak of science and technology. And there are many cutting-edge technologies that workers and farmers first climbed to. In solving many cutting-edge technical problems, we must resolutely follow the mass line, we must believe in the great creativity of the people, and we must use both indigenous and foreign methods. In the past, many people believed that rice transplanters were a cutting-edge technology and that workers and farmers were crude and uneducated and could not approach science. In 1956, at the Second National Rice Transplanter Conference, an "expert" requested that the task of researching rice transplanters be contracted to him alone. If we want to talk about conditions, this "expert" has machines for him to use, allocated special funds from the state, foreign technical data, and "theory", etc. In theory, he should be able to design the rice transplanter. However, because his way of thinking was incorrect, he studied behind closed doors, did not combine with the workers and farmers, and did not combine with production practice. As a result, the rice transplanter he designed and trial-produced used a lot of steel, was bulky, and could not be put into the water. Most of the people who successfully created rice transplanters this time were "local experts" from worker and farmer backgrounds who were looked down upon by bourgeois experts in the past. Under the leadership of the Party, they have a high degree of socialist and communist consciousness, a soaring spirit, dare to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, are not afraid of losing face, are not afraid of failure, if they fail, they will do it again, learn humbly, work hard, make persistent efforts, and persevere to the end. Therefore, success is fast. The "Hubei Hanchuan-59 type" was improved 23 times before it succeeded. The "Hunan Leiyang Rice Transplanter" was changed 175 times before it succeeded. Comrade He Jisheng was then a cadre of the agricultural cooperative. He was busy with administrative work during the day and studied rice transplanters at night. They were subjected to various sarcasms from conservatives who said, "If bumpkins can make machines, machines are worthless." In fact, many machines in the world were initially conceived and researched by "bumpkins." Some of them were quickly successfully researched with the help of technicians. Facts have proven that all scientific and technical personnel can only give full play to their role and make truly useful contributions if they put down their airs, resolutely devote themselves to the fiery mass movement, and combine the theoretical knowledge in books with the practical experience of workers and farmers. The "South Agricultural No. 2" rice transplanter was created by the combination of workers, farmers, and intellectuals. Letting go of the masses, launching mass movements on a large scale, resolutely relying on the collective strength and wisdom of the masses, and closely combining cadres, technicians, and the broad masses should be the fundamental direction of our scientific research work.

The success of the rice transplanter once again proves the accuracy of the truth pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong: "Letting go of the masses and doing everything through experiments."

Letting go of the masses and promoting rice transplanters, realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization in the most tense operation link of agricultural activities, and solving the problem of labor shortage are important measures to ensure the continued leap forward in agriculture in the future. At present, rice transplanters have gone through the experimental research stage, undergone large-scale zonal production experiments, and leapt to a new stage of standardized promotion. In 1960, the various provinces are preparing to promote millions of rice transplanters. The promotion of this batch of rice transplanters will play a huge role in improving labor efficiency and increasing production on a large scale. This is a major event, and we must do it well.

The forms of rice transplanters are diverse, including native, foreign, and semi-native and semi-foreign. Localities should select rice transplanters suitable for local use based on technical conditions and manufacturing capabilities, accelerate manufacturing, and let go of promotion. If conditions permit to manufacture foreign rice transplanters, then manufacture and promote foreign ones; if conditions are insufficient to manufacture foreign ones, then manufacture and promote native ones or a combination of native and foreign. In addition to the seven types mentioned earlier, other types that various provinces and localities deem suitable for promotion should also be actively manufactured and promoted. Under current conditions, general areas should focus on promoting native rice transplanters. Native rice transplanters are easy to manufacture, quick to promote, and easy to popularize. The Liling rice transplanter is mainly made of bamboo and wood, and only requires two liang of foreign nails per machine, making it simple to manufacture and low in cost. The combination of native and foreign should also be actively promoted. Foreign rice transplanters, such as the "South 105-B type", have high efficiency and should be actively manufactured and promoted in areas where conditions permit. This is the direction we are moving in.

All localities must ensure the quality of the products when manufacturing rice transplanters. Rice transplanters that have been promoted should also be continuously organized for inspection, and specific problems encountered in use should be resolved to give full play to the actual effects of saving labor and increasing production, and research and improve the path to perfection.

The raw materials needed for manufacturing rice transplanters in various localities should adhere to the principle of self-reliance and be solved locally.

Technical training should be done well. Before the transplanting season, it is necessary to adopt practical on-site teaching methods to train two classes of operators for each rice transplanter according to the promotion plan. Train repair personnel in advance, organize field mobile repair teams during the transplanting season, and do a good job in the repair, maintenance, use, and storage of rice transplanters.

As the comrades said: After the large-scale promotion of rice transplanters, there is no doubt that it will give full play to its advantages on a large area, but it must be estimated that there are still certain shortcomings in the existing various types of rice transplanters. In addition, due to technical unskilledness in the rush production, some unqualified requirements will naturally appear. It is inevitable that there will be phenomena where rice transplanter operators are unskilled and cannot transplant well, and some are even worse than manual transplanting. All these problems must be estimated, and we must have firm confidence. If there is a problem, do not regret it or retreat, but move forward bravely, and we will definitely be able to win.

The initial success of rice transplanters can only be said to have broken through the most important barrier to mechanized operations in paddy fields. We must continue to move forward and gradually solve the problem of agricultural mechanization in the southern paddy field areas.

The current task is to continue to improve the rice transplanter itself, eliminate missed transplants, hooked seedlings, and damaged seedlings; early rice, mid-season rice, late rice, tender seedlings, and strong seedlings can all be transplanted; the density and depth can be flexibly adjusted. Concentrate the advantages of various existing machines and create a power-driven rice transplanter that is best suited for manual, animal, mechanical, and electric power. Power self-propelled, tractor-towed, suspended, rope-towed, and remote-controlled types must be researched. Further research the requirements and principles related to rice transplanters, agronomy, and manufacturing structure, materials, and process requirements, etc. In short, we must continue to improve work efficiency and minimize labor intensity.

We must solve the semi-mechanization and mechanization of the entire transplanting process, and create a complete set of semi-mechanized and mechanized tools for pulling seedlings, washing seedlings, preparing seedlings, transporting seedlings, loading seedlings, and transplanting that meet agricultural requirements and have high work efficiency, reducing the auxiliary man-hours consumed by using rice transplanters for transplanting. It now takes 20 people to pull seedlings and 3 people to prepare seedlings to use a "South 105-B type" machine for transplanting. This situation must be changed quickly.

On the existing basis, complete the research on the serialization of paddy field operation machinery. We need a complete set of agricultural machinery suitable for paddy fields to implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, such as paddy field deep plows, harrows, cultivators suitable for close planting requirements, and agricultural machinery for preventing and controlling diseases and pests, high-efficiency manual, animal-powered, or machine-drawn harvesters, threshers, and dryers, etc., in order to accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture in rice-growing areas.

Semi-mechanization and mechanization of paddy field agricultural tools have made a lot of achievements, some have been initially successful, and some have shown signs and found clues. Under the leadership of the Party, we must continue to go all out, thoroughly oppose right-leaning, implement the spirit of the General Line, rely on the masses, and persevere. The technical transformation problem of paddy field cultivation can be solved, and the modernization of agriculture in rice-growing areas can be realized step by step.

    水稻插秧机的革命意义
    农业部副部长　刘瑞龙
    1956年，我国出现第一台水稻插秧机模型。四年来，各地不断试验研究，现在已经获得初步成功。在全国第七次插秧机评比会上，各地选送了八十四种插秧机，评选出“湖南醴陵二号”、“江西——五九型”、“广西五九——三型”、“上海南汇一号”、“湖北汉川——五九型”、“浙农四号”、“南一零五——Ｂ型”等七种插秧机，确定定型制造推广。此外，还有十四种向全国推荐试用。
    插秧机的种类多种多样，有土的，如“湖南醴陵二号”。半土半洋的，如“江西——五九型”、“广西五九——三型”、“上海南汇一号”、“湖北汉川——五九型”。也有洋的，如“南一零五——Ｂ型”（上述土洋，只是在相对意义上说的，意即有的比较简单，有的比较复杂）。插秧的方式，有直插式、滚插式、夹插式。从动力讲，有人力的，有畜力的，还有机械动力的。正是因为有多种多样的形式，使各地可以按照当地条件和需要加以选择。
    现在定型推广的插秧机，已经达到新的技术水平。
    第一、插秧质量好，符合农业技术要求。机插穴距均匀，能保证合理密植。机插秧苗深浅一致，入泥深度都在四到五厘米左右。过去插秧机作业有漏插、勾秧、伤秧和不均匀等缺点，现在已经基本解决。漏秧率少的1％，多的5％。勾秧率低的2％，高的30％以上。伤秧率少的不到1％，多的8％。均匀度达90％，差的60％或70％。机插水稻的插秧穴眼小，田间脚印少，秧苗拔出后曝晒时间短，栽插时没有包心秧。这些，都是有利于水稻生长发育的。
    第二、插秧效率高。按每亩三万穴的密度，用人工每天只插半亩。如用醴陵简易插秧机，每天可插三至四亩；用“江西——五九型”或“广西五九——三型”，每天可插五亩到七亩；用“南一零五——Ｂ型”，最多每天可插三十亩左右，机插比手插效率提高几倍、十几倍，甚至几十倍。
    第三、机身坚固，部件牢稳。这是几年来不断改进的结果，自然也包括工艺制造的质量在内。过去插秧机下水后，水浸日晒，极易变形，不能经久使用。现在不少地方用各种方法处理木材，已经做到机器不变形，下水后可以比较持久地作业。
    第四、操作轻便，劳动强度大大减轻。妇女、半劳力都能操作。湖南攸县妇女插秧能手陈彬秀，原先不相信用插秧机能插得好，插得快；后来，她和插秧机比赛了一番，结果插秧机比她快四倍，而且操作轻便。从此以后，她就积极地使用插秧机，由手插能手变成了机插能手。
    使用插秧机插秧，既能抢住季节，又能保证合理密植。1959年全国试用各种型号插秧机栽插水稻的面积，达到六十八万多亩。各地大面积试验的田间鉴定证明，使用插秧机插秧是增产的。据贵州、湖南、四川、安徽、湖北、江西、河北等十四个点统计，机插比手插增产的情况是：增产2％到10％的有六个点，增产11％到20％的有四个点，增产31％到35％的有四个点。使用插秧机不仅提高工效，而且增产，农民十分喜爱插秧机。贵州农民唱的妙：“自古插秧手称能，如今机器飞田中，保质保量效率高，腰不酸来腿不疼。初看好似龙戏水，转眼青纱已织成。”
    水稻插秧机研究成功和推广普及，是我国水田农具的大革命，也是水稻栽培上的一个大革命。这是党的总路线的胜利，是农业生产大跃进的产物，是农村人民公社化的产物，是毛泽东思想指导下的群众技术革新和技术革命运动的产物。
    水稻插秧机的试验成功和普及推广，对于根本改变我国水田的耕作技术的落后面貌，促进农业生产的全面跃进，有极为重要的意义。在我国社会主义改造尚未完成时，毛主席在1955年7月就指出实现我国农业机械化的重要意义，毛主席说：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”在这里毛主席所说“在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作”这个伟大理想，在水田地区，将会由于水稻插秧机的推广普及和不断改进提高而逐步地实现。我国有近四分之一的耕地是种植水稻的。水稻栽培有插秧移植和大田直播的两种方式。所占面积，前者是绝大多数，后者只在少数地区采用。现有经验证明，在深耕足肥、整地良好、管理精细的条件下，直播可以获得高产，但它的缺点是难于克服与前作生长的矛盾，前作未收，无法播种，在大部分地区一年只能种一季，加上条播株距密集，草苗齐长，清除杂草困难，在我国大多数地区耕地能种两季的情况下，一时难以推广。插秧（育苗移栽）的好处是：在小块秧田育苗期间，大田仍可种植其他作物，可以经济利用土地，提高复种指数；在秧田育苗、本田灌水以及整秧栽插时，都能有效地清除杂草；按一定穴距栽插，也便于中耕和通风透光。插秧是我国水稻生产中精耕细作传统中一项优良技术，也是今天绝大多数地区采用的比较可靠的增产办法。但是，水稻插秧对农时要求很严格，一般要求十天以内完成，时间拖延，就要减产。插秧费工多，劳动强度大。农业大跃进以来，水稻栽插密度加大，用工量随之加大。特别是收麦插秧和收早稻插晚稻的季节，劳动力是十分紧张的。所以，水稻插秧作业的机械化和半机械化，便成了我国水田地区广大农民的迫切要求。
    千百年来，我国农民曾经梦想有一种能够减轻繁重劳动的插秧工具。宋朝湖北武昌农民发明一种秧马，诗人苏东坡曾作秧马歌来歌颂它。全国解放后，广大农民提出了创造插秧机的要求，并且在不少地方进行创制插秧机的尝试，党紧紧地抓住了这个新事物的苗头，积极地领导了这个技术革命运动。
    插秧机从提出任务经多次试验创制到定型推广，中间经过无数次的斗争。既要和由于缺乏现成经验所产生的困难作斗争，又要和右倾保守思想的阻挠作斗争。党的各级组织坚决支持插秧机创制者的创造活动，党从各方面培育这个新生事物，人民公社的成就和威力，我国社会主义建设的高速度发展，都给插秧机创制活动以无限鼓舞。插秧机的成功，给人们的思想启发极大。
    第一、插秧机的初步成功，证明我国农业的机械化可以和我国精耕细作的传统结合起来，打破了过去有人认为“插秧不能机械化”的谬论。我国南方水田地区耕作能否机械化，首先取决于水稻田作业能否机械化，而水稻田作业中技术要求较高的就是插秧。这个环节一突破，便替水田地区机械化作业开辟了顺畅的道路。现在定型推广的插秧机多数还是靠人力操作的，因为诞生不久，难免有一些缺点，今后必将不断改进，逐渐完善。将来有了大量的动力牵引机械，插秧作业就可以比较容易地从半机械化过渡到机械化。最初怀疑的人们曾经认为用机器插秧是不可思议的。当插秧机初步成功的时候，他们又怀疑能否增产。他们强调插秧技术的复杂性，插秧条件的特殊性，并强调说，田小路窄，难以运行，地形崎岖难以改变等。诚然，插秧操作技术要求较高，分秧和送秧，曾经是所有插秧机创制者首先遇到的难题。但是，广大工人农民并没有被困难所吓倒，而是坚毅不拔地刻苦钻研，互相学习，努力创造。在怀疑的人们中，有一批思想上的懒汉和懦夫，既不愿向群众学习，又不肯刻苦钻研，他们在碰壁的时候，为了掩饰自己思想上的贫乏，于是就散布“插秧不能机械化”的谬论。插秧机创制者林体强同志从打字机等距移动的原理，找到了秧箱移动的办法来分秧。贺继生同志从梳头的梳子找到了夹式分秧的原理。他们的结论和懦夫懒汉的谬论相反：“插秧机械化虽说是困难的，但是，困难是可以攻破的。”现在无数事例证明：插秧不仅可以机械化，而且可以增产。插秧机不仅是提高劳动效率的工具，而且是增产的工具。
    第二、插秧机的初步成功，证明资本主义国家没有创造出来或者还没有创造成功的东西，我国人民是能够创造出来和创造成功的，别人还没有做到的事情，我们也不是不可以做到的，再一次沉重地打击了洋奴思想。我国农业机械化水平虽然比资本主义国家落后许多年，我们是能够在较短时间内赶上和超过他们的。有些资本主义国家多年前就有人研究插秧机，至今还没有成功。我们只花了几年的时间就初步成功了。这是什么原因呢？第一、我们有共产党的领导，有优越的社会主义制度，我国工人农民和知识分子，在共产党领导下，坚持政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放思想，树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，为了加速建设社会主义，都在大胆创造，忘我劳动，每一个人都以克服困难、帮助别人为光荣，集中领导，分地创造，互相学习，彼此促进，因此，成功就快。在资本主义社会，一切为了利润，为了个人发财，彼此互相保密，互相破坏，所以进度就很慢。第二、正因为我国是社会主义国家，我们能够采取群众路线的方法，不仅有专业研究队伍，而主要是依靠群众运动，采取多种多样的方案和方法，进行多点试验研究。根据不完全的统计，全国在试验中的插秧机就有二千多种。千百万人民群众开动脑筋，想问题，出主意，互相学习，取长补短，发挥集体智慧，所有插秧机的创制，都是你中有我，我中有你。就是这样，创制中的困难问题，就一个个地一批批地得到解决，插秧机就创制成功了。为了交流技术研究成果，全国和各地每年定期召开多次经验交流会，1956年以来，就召开了七次全国插秧机会议，这是资本主义国家办不到的。过去一些资产阶级技术人员认为：“资本主义国家的技术比我们强，他们都没有能解决插秧机的问题，中国技术落后，更是不能解决的。”1956年，华东农业科学研究所农具系的一个右派分子，就是根据这种荒谬论点，拚命主张把插秧机研究课题取消，十足地表现了这些人的洋奴思想。
    第三、插秧机初步成功的事实，证明广大工人农民是能够攀登科学技术高峰的。而且有许多尖端，正是工人农民首先攀登上去的。我们在解决许多尖端技术的问题上，必须坚决走群众路线，必须相信人民群众的伟大创造力，必须土洋并举，过去不少人认为插秧机是尖端技术，工人农民是大老粗，文化低，对科学是无法问津的。1956年，在全国第二次插秧机会议上，有一位“专家”，曾经要求把研究插秧机的任务由他一个人包揽下来。如果要讲条件的话，这位“专家”，有国家给他使用的机器，并且拨了专款，还有国外技术资料，又有“理论”等等，照理是应该能够把插秧机设计出来的。但是，由于他的思想方法不对头，关着门研究，不和工农群众结合，不和生产实际结合，结果他设计试制出来的插秧机，用钢很多，体形笨大，不能下水。这次创制插秧机成功的人，多数是过去资产阶级专家看不起的工农出身的“土专家”。他们在党的领导下，有高度的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，有冲天的干劲，敢于破除迷信，解放思想，敢想、敢说、敢做，不怕丢面子，不怕失败，失败了再干，虚心学习，刻苦钻研，再接再厉，坚持到底，因此，成功就快。“湖北汉川——五九型”改进了二十三次才成功。“湖南耒阳插秧机”改了一百七十五次才成功。贺继生同志是当时农业合作社干部，白天忙于行政工作，夜里研究插秧机，他们受到了保守主义者各种讽刺，说“土包子能造机器，机器就不值钱了。”其实，世界上许多机器，最初都是“土包子”设想出来和研究出来的，有的经过技术人员帮助，就很快研究成功。事实证明，一切科学技术人员，也只有放下架子，坚决投身于火热的群众运动，和工人农民一道，把书本上的理论知识和工人、农民的实践经验结合起来，才能充分发挥作用，作出真正有用的贡献。“南农二号”插秧机，就是工人、农民、知识分子三合一搞出来的。放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，坚决依靠群众的集体力量和智慧，干部、技术人员和广大群众密切结合，这应该是我们科学研究工作的根本方向。
    插秧机成功的事实，又一次证明了毛泽东同志所指示的“放手发动群众，一切通过试验”这一条真理的准确性。
    放手发动群众，推广插秧机，在农事活动最紧张的作业环节，实现半机械化、机械化，解决劳力不足的问题，是保证今后农业继续跃进的一项重大措施。目前水稻插秧机已经走过了试验研究阶段，经过了大面积分区生产实验，跃进到定型推广的新阶段。1960年各省准备推广的插秧机将有几百万台。这批插秧机的推广，在提高劳动工效和大面积增产等方面，都将起到极大的促进作用。这是一件大事，我们必须认真办好。
    插秧机的形式是多种多样的，有土有洋，也有半土半洋的。各地应该根据技术条件和制造能力，选择适合本地使用的插秧机，加速制造，放手推广。有条件能够制造洋的，就制造推广洋的；条件不足不能制造洋的，就制造推广土的或土洋结合的。除了前边所说七种以外，各省各地认为适宜推广的其他型号，也要积极制造推广。一般地区在目前条件下，应该以推广土的为主。土的制造容易，推广快，便于普及。醴陵插秧机主要是竹木结构，一台只要二两洋钉，制造简单，成本低廉。土洋结合的也应积极推广。洋的如“南一零五——Ｂ型”插秧机，效率高，在有条件的地区，应该积极制造推广，这是我们前进的方向。
    各地制造插秧机都要保证产品质量。推广出去的插秧机也要不断组织检查，解决使用中碰到的具体问题，发挥省工增产的实效，并研求改进和日臻完善的途径。
    各地制造插秧机所需原材料，应该坚持自力更生原则就地解决。
    要做好技术训练工作。在插秧季节前，必须根据推广计划，采取实际操作现场教学办法，每台插秧机培训两班操作手。提前培训修理人员，在插秧季节，组织田间流动修理组，做好插秧机的修理维护和使用保管工作。
    正如同志们所说那样：大量推广插秧机之后，无疑地会在大面积上发挥它的优越性，但是，必须估计到，现有各种型号的插秧机都还存在着一定的缺点。加上在赶制中技术不熟练，自然会出现一些不合规格要求的。插秧机手操作不熟练，插不好的现象也必然会发生，甚至有些比手插的还差。所有这些毛病都必须估计到，必须有坚定的信心，出了毛病不后悔，不退缩，勇往直前，就一定能够胜利。
    水稻插秧机的初步成功，只能说是突破了水田机械化作业最重要的一关。我们要继续前进，逐步地解决南方水田地区农业机械化的问题。
    当前的任务是，插秧机本身要继续改进，消灭漏秧、勾秧、伤秧现象；早稻、中稻、晚稻、嫩秧、壮秧都能插；密度和深度可以灵活调节。集中现有各种机子的优点，创制一种动力的，最好是人力、畜力、机械动力、电力通用的插秧机。动力自走式、拖拉机牵引式、悬挂式、绳索牵引式以及遥远控制式都要研究。进一步研究有关插秧机的要求原理、农艺，以及制造上的结构、材料和工艺要求等。总之，要继续提高工效，尽量减轻劳动强度。
    我们要解决整个插秧过程半机械化、机械化的问题，创造出一整套的半机械化、机械化的拔秧、洗秧、整秧、运秧、装秧、插秧合乎农业要求的、高工效的工具，减少使用插秧机插秧所消耗的辅助工时。现在使用一台“南一零五——Ｂ型”机子插秧，需要二十个人拔秧，三个人整秧，这种情况是必须迅速改变的。
    在现有基础上，完成水田作业机械系列化的研究。我们需要一整套的适合水田贯彻农业“八字宪法”的农业机械，例如水田深耕犁、耙，适合密植要求的中耕器和防治病虫的农械，高效率的人力、畜力或机引的收获机、脱谷机以及干燥机等，以便加速水稻地区农业的技术改造。
    水田农具的半机械化和机械化，已经做出不少成绩，有的已经初步成功，有的已经露出苗头，找到线索。我们要在党的领导下，继续鼓足干劲，反透右倾，贯彻总路线的精神，依靠群众，坚持下去，水田耕作的技术改造问题是能够解决的，水稻地区农业的现代化是能够一步一步实现的。
