    Unleash Greater Power of the "Small Foreign Groups"
    Gansu Comprehensively Overhauls More Than Thirty Small Blast Furnaces
    Jiangxi Hongdu Steel Plant Makes Great Strides Towards Mechanization and Automation

    According to Gansu Daily, in order to enable the "small foreign groups" of the iron and steel industry to exert greater power and further achieve high yield, high quality, low cost, and safe production, iron-smelting plants throughout Gansu Province are stepping up the technical transformation of small blast furnaces. Of the first batch of thirty-six small blast furnaces to be transformed, thirty-two have been fully put under construction.

    The "small foreign groups" of iron smelting in Gansu Province have achieved tremendous production results in the past year. In 1959, they produced a large amount of "foreign iron," which not only met the province's steelmaking needs but also supplied a large amount of pig iron raw materials for industry, agriculture, capital construction, and transportation. To improve the production level of small blast furnaces, a number of small blast furnaces throughout the province underwent technical transformation last year. After the technical transformation of the No. 8 small blast furnace with a volume of 28 cubic meters in the Shandan Iron Plant, the maximum daily output reached 41 tons, and the utilization coefficient reached 1.46.

    This year, the province plans to technically transform sixty-six small iron-smelting blast furnaces, which will be constructed in two batches. The transformation method mainly involves learning from advanced experiences from other places, combined with the actual conditions of the province, focusing on solving the problem of high air volume and high temperature, and transforming the unreasonable parts of the original design and furnace construction. The main contents of the technical transformation are to increase the tuyere and pipe diameter, expand the heat-receiving area of the hot-blast stove, promote the advanced experience of multi-nozzle combustion of the hot-blast stove and parallel air supply of double blowers and double hot-blast stoves, add cooling equipment and feeding equipment to the furnace body, and make corresponding series of transformations to the gas system and dust removal system of the small blast furnace. In this way, not only can the manual feeding of small blast furnaces gradually move towards mechanization, reducing workers' physical labor, but it can also achieve high air volume and high temperature, prolong furnace life, and ensure that iron-smelting production reaches high output and high quality.

    At present, from Jiayuguan in the west to Santianmen in the east, the thirty-two small blast furnaces distributed in the province's twelve iron-smelting plants have entered a climax of technical transformation. On the scaffolding of the chimneys dozens of meters high, the construction red flags are fluttering in the wind, and civil engineering and installation projects are proceeding simultaneously. The small blast furnaces undergoing technical transformation in the Yongdeng, Beidaobu, Hexibao, Shandan, and Baiyin iron plants have begun installation. The small blast furnaces in the Yongdeng and Beidaobu iron plants, where the construction progress is faster, have begun preparations for production.

    To strengthen the organization and leadership of the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, the Provincial Planning Commission, the Provincial Economic Commission, the Provincial Capital Construction Commission, and relevant departments have jointly formed a small blast furnace technical transformation office, and all regions have established small blast furnace technical transformation committees or headquarters. To support the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, the Provincial Machinery Industry Bureau has mobilized thirty-eight machinery factories and practice factories of relevant machinery schools throughout the province to vigorously rush to manufacture various equipment needed for small blast furnaces.

    According to Jiangxi Daily, the Jiangxi Nanchang Hongdu Steel Plant is making great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, marching towards mechanization, automation, and high speed.

    The Hongdu Steel Plant was established in May 1958. At the beginning of its construction, it only had one 0.5-ton steelmaking converter, using indigenous methods for casting and manual carrying of steel ladle for production. Under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, all the factory's employees insisted on implementing the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," adhering to indigenous methods first, then foreign methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. In the process of consolidating and improving, the factory's Party committee grasped both production and capital construction with both hands. By August of last year, this steel plant, which started from a "small indigenous group," had completely turned to a "small foreign group" and become a combined iron and steel enterprise with steelmaking, rolling, seamless steel tube, and silicon iron workshops.

    In order to further improve the "small foreign group" on the basis of the victories already achieved and to meet the needs of the rapid development of the national construction cause, the factory's Party committee further mobilized the masses of employees to vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, marching towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation. The employees of each workshop, in light of the production situation of their departments, actively looked for key points and made suggestions. The rolling workshop put forward the bold slogan of "coiling, conveyor rollers, and high-speed production," which set off a wave of advancement towards mechanization and automation. In a short period of time, many manual labor processes have been mechanized and automated. The heating furnace of the 400-250 mm rolling mill was equipped with a conveyor roller and a steel plate turning machine. After the steel ingot comes out of the heating furnace, it can automatically rotate and automatically enter the rolling mill. The steel feeding speed is twice as fast as manual operation, which greatly reduces the labor intensity of the workers. Now, the 400 mm rolling mill has changed from two heats and two finished products in the past to one heat and one finished product. Some rolling mills are also equipped with an earthen lifting platform in front of them. When rolling six-inch steel ingots, it can automatically lift and lower, feeding the steel ingots to the rolling mill, changing the heavy operation of manual steel feeding in the past. On the newly installed 200 mm rolling mill, forward and reverse coils were installed, and the steel ingot can automatically enter and exit the rolling mill, ensuring safe production. The seamless steel tube workshop has already put eleven major technical innovation projects into production. Among them, the moving switch of the cold shear only needs to be stepped on by the steel feeding worker, which changes the phenomenon that a special person must direct it in the past. This workshop also replaced the large pusher rod of the pushing machine with two seamless steel tubes, which realized the mechanization of steel output from the heating furnace.

    Due to the continuous improvement of working conditions, the enthusiasm of the factory's employees for production has become increasingly high, creating many outstanding achievements. The small converter produced high-quality steel, and the production cost decreased by 12.6%; the output of the seamless steel tube piercing mill of the two-hundred-millimeter rolling mill exceeded the design capacity. In the more than one year since the plant was put into production, it has produced a large number of high-quality steel, steel products, and seamless steel tubes for the country, which not only supplied the needs of industrial and mining enterprises and rural water conservancy construction in Jiangxi Province, but also supported brother factories and mines in Guangzhou, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Anhui and other provinces and cities.

    让“小洋群”发挥更大威力
    甘肃三十多座小高炉进行全面技术改造
    江西洪都钢铁厂向机械化和自动化大举进军
    据甘肃日报消息　为让钢铁工业“小洋群”发挥更大的威力，进一步做到高产、优质、低成本和安全生产，甘肃全省各炼铁厂正抓紧进行小高炉的技术改造。第一批要改造的三十六座小高炉，已有三十二座全面施工。
    甘肃省炼铁“小洋群”一年来生产成绩巨大，1959年生产了大量洋铁，除满足全省炼钢用铁外，并为工业、农业、基本建设和交通运输等部门，供应了大量的生铁原料。为了提高小高炉生产水平，去年全省就有一批小高炉进行了技术改造。山丹铁厂二十八立方米的八号小高炉，经过技术改造以后，最高日产量达到四十一吨，利用系数到了一点四六。
    今年全省计划进行技术改造的炼铁小高炉有六十六座，先后分两批施工。改造的方法，主要是吸取外地的先进经验，结合本省的实际情况，着重从解决大风高温入手，改造原来设计和建炉方面不合理的部分。技术改造的主要内容，是加大风口和管径，扩大热风炉的受热面积，推广热风炉多嘴燃烧和双风机、双热风炉并联送风的先进经验，增添炉体部分冷却设备和上料设备，小高炉的煤气系统和除尘系统，也相应地进行一系列的改造。这样，不但可以使小高炉人工上料逐步走向机械化，减轻工人的体力劳动，而且可以达到大风高温，延长炉龄，保证炼铁生产达到高产优质。
    目前，西起嘉峪关，东至三天门，分布在全省十二座炼铁厂的三十二座小高炉，已进入技术改造的高潮。几十米高的烟囱脚手架上，施工的红旗迎风招展，土建和安装工程交叉并进。永登、北道埠、河西堡、山丹、白银市等铁厂进行技术改造的小高炉，已开始安装。永登铁厂和北道埠铁厂施工进度较快的小高炉，已开始进行生产准备工作。
    为加强对小高炉技术改造的组织领导，省计划委员会、省经济委员会、省基本建设委员会和各有关厅局共同组成了小高炉技术改造办公室，各地区都分别成立了小高炉技术改造委员会或指挥部。为支援小高炉的技术改造，省机械工业局动员全省三十八个机械厂和有关机械学校的实习工厂，正在大力赶制小高炉需用的各种设备。
    据江西日报消息　江西南昌洪都钢铁厂大闹技术革新和技术革命，向机械化、自动化、高速化进军。
    洪都钢铁厂是1958年5月间建立起来的，开始建厂时，只有一套零点五吨炼钢转炉，用土法浇注，人工抬钢水包进行生产。全厂职工在厂党委领导下，坚持贯彻执行党的“两条腿走路”的方针，坚持土法上马，先土后洋，土洋并举。在边巩固、边提高的过程中，厂党委一手抓生产，一手抓基建。到去年8月，这个由“小土群”起家的钢铁厂，全部转向了“小洋群”，成为一座拥有炼钢、轧钢、无缝钢管、矽铁车间的钢铁联合企业。
    为了在已经取得的胜利的基础上，把“小洋群”再大大提高一步，适应国家建设事业飞跃发展的需要，这个厂的党委进一步发动职工群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命，向机械化、半机械化、自动化进军。各车间职工针对本部门生产情况，积极找关键，提建议。轧钢车间提出“围盘化、运输滚道化、生产高速化”的豪迈口号，掀起了向机械化、自动化进军的热潮。在很短的时间里，不少手工人力生产的工序，便实现了机械化、自动化。400—250公厘轧钢机加热炉安装了运输滚道、翻钢板机，钢锭从加热炉中出来以后，可自动翻转，自动进入轧钢机，喂钢速度比手工操作加快了两倍，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。现在，400公厘轧钢机上已由过去两次加热，两次成材，变成一次加热，一次成材。有的轧钢机前还安装了土升降台，轧六寸钢锭时，它能自动升降，把钢锭喂给轧钢机，改变了过去用人抬喂钢的笨重操作，在新装的200公厘轧钢机上，安装起了正反围盘，钢锭在轧钢机上可自动进出，保证了安全生产。无缝钢管车间已经有十一项重大技术革新项目投入了生产。其中冷剪机移动开关，只要喂钢工人用脚一踏就行，改变了过去必须专人指挥的现象。这个车间还用两根无缝钢管代替推出机的大顶杆，使加热炉出钢实现了机械化。
    由于劳动条件不断改善，全厂职工生产热情愈发高涨，创造了许多出色的成绩。小转炉炼出了优质钢，生产成本下降幅度为12．6％；二百公厘的轧钢机无缝钢管穿孔机的产量超过了设计能力。这个厂投入生产一年多的时间，已为国家生产了大批优质钢、钢材和无缝钢管，不仅供给了江西全省工矿企业生产和农村水利等建设的需要，还支援了广州、黑龙江、湖南、安徽等省市的兄弟厂矿。
