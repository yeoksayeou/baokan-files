Xinhua News Agency, Nairobi, 15th. Approximately one thousand Africans in the Thompson's Falls area of central Kenya held demonstrations on the 13th, demanding that British colonialists get out of their country.

Some women of the Kikuyu tribe, known for their fighting tradition, spoke at the meeting, saying that Dedan Kimathi, the Kenyan national hero who had been murdered by the British colonialists, still lived in the hearts of the African people. They strongly hoped that Jomo Kenyatta, the Kenyan people's leader who was still imprisoned, would return soon.

The news said that the British colonial authorities sent police to suppress the rally and arrested three African women.

Since the conclusion of the Kenya "Constitutional" Round Table Conference in London, the Kenyan people have intensified their struggle for independence. They have universally expressed dissatisfaction with the "constitutional" proposals for Kenya put forward by British Colonial Secretary Macleod, because they realize that this plan is an attempt by the colonialists to obstruct Kenya's independence.

    要求英国殖民主义者滚出去
    怯尼亚非洲人举行示威集会
    据新华社15日讯　内罗毕消息：怯尼亚中部汤普逊瀑布区约一千名非洲人在13日举行示威集会，要求英国殖民者滚出他们的国家。
    富有战斗传统的吉库元族的一些妇女在会上讲话时说，已被英国殖民者杀害的怯尼亚民族英雄德丹·基马提仍旧活在非洲人民的心中。她们强烈希望仍被监禁着的怯尼亚人民领袖肯雅塔早日回来。
    消息说，英国殖民当局曾派警察对这次集会进行镇压，并逮捕了三名非洲妇女。
    自从在伦敦举行的怯尼亚“制宪”圆桌会议结束以来，怯尼亚人民加强了他们争取独立的斗争。他们普遍表示对英国殖民大臣麦克劳德提出的关于怯尼亚的“宪法”方案表示不满，因为他们认识到这个方案是殖民者企图用来阻挠怯尼亚独立的。
