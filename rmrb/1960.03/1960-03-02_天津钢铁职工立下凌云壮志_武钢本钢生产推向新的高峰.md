Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 1st: All workers in the Tianjin Municipality's steel and refractory materials system are determined to strengthen collaboration and jointly overcome the current critical problems of insufficient refractory material supply and short converter furnace life. They aim to immediately propel steel production to a new high tide, guaranteeing the completion of the first quarter production plan three days ahead of schedule, in response to the initiative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company.

The Tianjin steel enterprises are carrying out a "Spring Production Campaign." The initiative from Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has further ignited the production campaign in each steel mill and refractory material factory. In recent days, factories have held worker meetings, formulating new production targets and technological innovation measures.

Workers at each steelmaking plant proposed to engage in more charging and faster smelting in March, to comprehensively promote the advanced experiences of hot-blast pig iron and hot-blast steelmaking, to carry out major technical transformations in furnace building, to achieve mechanization of converter repair, to shorten repair time, to extend converter life, and to further improve the level of steel production. While ensuring the early completion of the first quarter production plan, they will also fully prepare for the second quarter production. After hearing the initiative from Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, workers at the refractory material factories immediately convened an emergency meeting, determined to produce more refractory bricks to support each steelmaking plant. They decided to further strengthen calcination capacity, and, while ensuring quality, to increase the production level of dolomite bricks and casting bricks and other refractory materials by about 15%.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 1st: All workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company warmly responded to the initiative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, guaranteeing the early completion of the first quarter production plan and making preparations for the second quarter production.

The company's workers were very enthusiastic in discussing the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel, determined to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization and automation, to a new high tide. In March, they are determined to focus on the following measures: 1. Strive to improve the grade of concentrate and the quality and yield of sintered ore, so that more than 85% of sintered ore is used in blast furnaces; 2. In steelmaking, overcome the problem of high sulfur and high temperature in scrap steel; 3. Give full play to the capacity of existing equipment, do a good job in maintenance and repair, and ensure safe operation of equipment; 4. Achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization of loading and unloading to ensure immediate unloading upon arrival and prevent backlog of vehicles.

    天津钢铁职工立下凌云壮志
    武钢本钢生产推向新的高峰
    新华社天津1日电　天津市钢铁和耐火器材系统全体职工，决心加强协作，共同攻克当前耐火器材供应不足和转炉炉龄较短的关键问题，立即把钢铁生产推向新的高潮，保证提前三天完成第一季度生产计划，响应石景山钢铁公司的倡议。
    天津市钢铁企业正在开展“春季生产运动会”，石景山钢铁公司的倡议发出后，使各钢厂和耐火器材厂的生产运动会更加炽热。连日来各厂都纷纷举行了职工大会，制订了新的生产指标和技术革新措施。
    各炼钢厂职工提出，3月份要大搞多装快炼，全面推广热风化铁和热风炼钢的先进经验，大搞砌炉技术改造，实现转炉补炉机械化，缩短补炉时间，延长转炉寿命，进一步提高钢的生产水平。在确保提前完成首季生产计划的同时，还要充分作好第二季度的生产准备工作。耐火器材厂职工听了石景山钢铁公司的倡议后，当夜就召开了紧急会议，决心生产更多的耐火砖支援各个炼钢厂。他们决定进一步加强煅烧能力，在保证质量的情况下把白云石砖和浇钢砖等耐火器材的生产水平提高15％左右。
    新华社武汉1日电　武汉钢铁公司全体职工热烈响应石景山钢铁公司的倡议，保证提前完成第一季度生产计划，并为第二季度生产做好准备工作。
    这个公司的职工在讨论石钢的倡议时，干劲很大，决心高举毛泽东思想红旗，把以机械化、自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高潮。在3月份里，他们决心狠抓下列措施：一、努力提高精矿品位和烧结矿的质量、产量，使高炉用烧结矿达到85％以上；二、在炼钢方面，要攻克废钢高硫高温关；三、充分发挥现有设备能力，做好维护检修工作，保证设备安全运转；四、实现装卸半机械化、机械化，保证随到随卸，不积压车辆。
