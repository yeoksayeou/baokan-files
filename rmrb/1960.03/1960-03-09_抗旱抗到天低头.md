    Fighting Drought Until Heaven Lowers its Head
    Li Zhenxing, First Secretary of the CPC Leinan County Committee
    Leinan County, Guangdong Province, suffered a severe drought last year, a drought unseen in a century. The county has not had heavy rain for sixteen consecutive months, from October 1958 to the present.
    
        Absolutely Not a Myth
    What has such a severe drought turned Leinan County into? Has it caused disaster? Have we asked the state for relief? We can answer with certainty: No. Not only did we not ask for relief, and did not suffer a disaster, but we also achieved a bumper harvest of grain in 1959. The county's total grain output last year increased by more than 10% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. We overfulfilled the state grain purchase task by 15%, transferring more than 10 million catties of rice more than in 1958 to support national construction. We also shouldered the grain supply for one-quarter of the county's total population who are non-agricultural workers and thirteen state-owned reclamation farms, promoting the development of industry and agricultural reclamation. In addition to leaving enough grain for rations, Leinan farmers, for the first time, set aside 14.4 million catties of reserve grain and repaid more than 2.2 million yuan in state loans. Furthermore, commune members' savings continued to rise, with total rural savings in the county reaching more than 3 million yuan, averaging more than 30 yuan per household.
    Such a severe drought, achieving such a great victory, seems like a mythical story, unbelievable. However, this is a living fact, and the 600,000 people of Leinan County can bear witness. If we compare last year's drought and the victory of the drought resistance struggle with the drought of the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu fifty years ago, it will be even more obvious. In that year, after only six months of drought, there was a serious famine with barren land and people unable to make a living. According to county records, tens of thousands of people starved to death. This drought lasted for a year and four months, which was much more serious than the drought in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu, but there was no sign of disaster, only a bumper harvest. What power conquered the universe? What power turned the year of severe drought into a year of bumper harvest? This is the glory of Mao Zedong Thought, the power of the General Line, the great victory achieved by the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line, with the heroic spirit of fearlessness. Declare War on Nature
    In the winter of 1958, the drought in Leinan County had already developed to a considerable degree: 40% of the sweet potatoes planted in winter died from drought, crops on sloping land could not be planted in time, and early rice had no water to prepare the fields. Under the threat of such a disaster, people were not discouraged. Their drought resistance struggle showed that people can transform the world, people can conquer nature, and people's subjective initiative contains infinite power. They held high the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and declared war on the drought. They firmly believed that the greatest difficulty cannot withstand the spirit of "hard work." At the height of the drought, more than 200,000 people in the county, day and night, carried water to rush-plant cassava, rush-plant sugarcane, and rescue winter sweet potatoes. After that period of hard work, a total of 70,000 mu of sugarcane, 40,000 mu of cassava, and 50,000 mu of miscellaneous grains were planted, and 100,000 mu of drought-stricken winter sweet potatoes were saved, winning the first victory in the drought resistance struggle. However, the heavens were blind and wanted to fight against the people. By the beginning of last year's spring, the drought was even more serious. Most of the sugarcane and cassava planted before the Spring Festival were damaged or died from drought, and 100,000 mu of the 250,000 mu of early rice lacked water for field preparation. Faced with this difficulty, such a serious drought, some people began to waver. At this time, the Leinan County Party Committee used Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line to arm the people of the county again, talking a lot about man's determination to conquer nature, a lot about human effort being the key, repeatedly publicizing the role of people, and emphasizing that people can create history and create the world. Why can't people change history and transform the world? They can. We told the people of the county: Drought is not terrible, the heavens are not terrible, the most terrible thing is that people extinguish their own ambition, extinguish their own prestige, and extinguish their confidence in overcoming disasters. Once the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line was accepted by the masses, people's mental outlook was completely renewed, and a lively scene of drought resistance struggle appeared again at the southernmost tip of the motherland. People combined the struggle against pessimism and cowardice with the struggle against nature to overcome drought. If thought rises one foot, production rises ten feet. The surging drought resistance movement unfolded vigorously. Last spring, Leinan County was a sea of people during the day and brightly lit at night. The mountains and rivers of the southern country, with an area of 3,900 square kilometers, formed a boiling sea of drought resistance struggle.
      “Even if Heaven Refuses to Lower its Head”
    In the end, human power is greater than heaven. If the heavens let one mu die from drought, the people replant two mu; if a deep well dries up, the people dig two zhang deeper. "The people have eaten the gall of the God of Thunder, and are not afraid of heaven refusing to lower its head"! The revolutionary people drew water from wells several zhang deep to irrigate the fields, carried water from dozens of miles away to rush-plant, and dug canals and rivers on large stone mountains dozens of miles away to divert water more than a hundred miles to protect seedlings. After day and night attacks, they conquered the heavens once again. Under such severe disaster conditions, the early rice was planted on more than 20,000 mu more land than the early rice in 1958. After more than 70,000 mu of sugarcane died from drought, more than 110,000 mu were replanted, and the sweet potato area also increased compared with 1958. The heroic people of Leinan were moved by the joy of victory in the battle, and people became more convinced of the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line.
    The victory of early rice drought resistance and rush-planting encouraged the people of the county. After rush-planting, people launched a climax of drought resistance to protect seedlings. 130,000 people in the county were stationed at the edge of the fields, drawing water day and night to resist the disaster. Soon after transplanting, in addition to 150,000 mu of early rice with the water conservancy guarantee of the newly built reservoir in 1958, there were still 110,000 mu of early rice, 100,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes, and 110,000 mu of sugarcane that needed to be watered to protect the seedlings. Each mu of crops needs 400 dan of water to protect the seedlings once, so 320,000 mu of crops need 128 million dan of water for one drought resistance. 130,000 people in the county were involved in drought resistance, and each person had to carry an average of 1,000 dan of water for each watering. One watering can only guarantee water for ten days, so one person has to carry 100 dan of water a day. Almost everyone in Leinan was carrying a load all day and night, fighting hard.
    Severe drought and heavy labor forced people to carry out major tool reforms. They changed from manual water carrying to water truck transportation, and from manual water drawing to animal-powered water lifting. In particular, the drought resistance struggle promoted water conservancy construction. For example, the canal of the Dashuiqiao Reservoir, from Fucheng to Maichen, had to pass through a large stone mountain—Hua Fengling—28 li long and more than 1 zhang and 6 chi deep. The original plan was to open the canal in three years, but at the height of the drought, people opened a simple canal on the 28-li-long stone mountain in just one month, diverting water to Maichen and ensuring the harvest of 8,000 mu of early rice in Maichen Commune.
    Nature is cruel in the face of weak people, but docile in the face of strong people. Leinan County's early harvest in 1959, after a hundred days of hard work, not only did not reduce production, but also achieved a larger bumper harvest than the early harvest in 1958. The total rice output increased by 18% compared with 1958, and other miscellaneous grain crops also increased. The living standards of the people were slightly higher than before the drought.
    Victory After Victory
    The bumper harvest of early rice did not end the drought resistance battle. After summer, the drought became more and more serious. From the Qingming Festival, after a few millimeters of light rain, until the Lesser Heat, it was more than a hundred days of clear skies. However, the people of Leinan are unconquerable. Except for the sugarcane that died from drought and could not be replanted, all other crops were planted while dying, and planted again today if they died from drought tomorrow. The heroic commune members of Tantou Commune planted more than 10,000 mu of sloping rice. After that, it died from drought, so they replanted miscellaneous grains. After the miscellaneous grains died from drought, they replanted sweet potatoes again and again, until the last crust of soil hardened, and it was impossible to plow or dig. They used iron shovels and pickaxes, chipping away at the hard land one by one, and rush-planted one by one. This drought resistance struggle lasted until three days before the Beginning of Autumn, when some areas of the county had some moderate rain. The county party committee seized this golden opportunity and led the masses to rush-transplant 560,000 mu of late rice and rush-plant 480,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes within half a month, expanding the late rice area by 100,000 mu compared with 1958 and the autumn sweet potato area by 380,000 mu, achieving the county party committee's pre-planned goal of planting more and harvesting more. However, this rainfall was very uneven. The northeastern part had heavy rain, while the southwestern part was still scorching sun. However, whether it rains or not, the people of Leinan do not rely on the God of Heaven for food. If it rains, they plant; if it does not rain, they resist. The General Line produces hard work, which is forever unconquerable. The Xujialiao Brigade of Maichen Commune did not have a single rain of 10 millimeters last year, but they continued to hold high the banner of the Great Leap Forward. It was too dry, and rice could not be planted, so they all changed to planting sweet potatoes. Later, the sweet potatoes were dry, so they relied on 582 wells in the fields to resist the drought. The wells in the fields soon dried up, so they dug 420 more wells. When the 420 wells were about to dry up again, they assigned people to live in the fields, and took a scoop of water to sprinkle on the sweet potatoes. After such hard struggle, although all the rice was lost, the sweet potatoes increased fourfold. Recently, the county party committee went to the brigade to understand the situation. The commune members not only lived well in the previous period, but also now have more than 1,000 catties of dried sweet potatoes per person on average. The commune members smiled and said: "Let it be dry! Even if it is dry for another year, we still have something to eat."
    The decisive battle against drought in the late season also achieved a bumper harvest in the late season. Rice production increased by nearly 40%, autumn sweet potato production more than doubled, and other industries such as salt industry, fishery, and sideline industries also had great increases.
    At present, the people of Leinan County continue to take drought resistance as the key, grasping both planting and high yield, and vigorously engaging in spring plowing production. The county has expanded the early rice area by more than 80,000 mu and prepared more than 40,000 mu of fields. At the same time, it has carried out a series of transformations on 70,000 mu of backward fields, remote fields, and mountain pit fields, laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest of grain.

    抗旱抗到天低头
    中共雷南县委第一书记　李振兴
    广东雷南县去年遭到了百年罕见的严重旱灾，全县自1958年10月直至现在，一连十六个月没有下过大雨。
        绝不是神话
    这样严重的旱灾，究竟使雷南县变成了什么样子？有没有因旱成灾？有没有伸手要国家救济？我们肯定地回答：没有。不但没有要救济，没有闹灾荒，反而取得了1959年粮食大丰收。全县去年粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年还增产一成多。超额15％完成了国家征购粮食的任务，比1958年多上调了一千多万斤大米支援国家建设，还担负全县总人口四分之一的非农业人口和十三个国营垦殖农场的粮食供给，促进了工业和农垦事业的发展。雷南农民除留足口粮外，还破天荒第一次留下了一千四百四十万斤储备粮，还清了国家二百二十多万元贷款。除此之外，公社社员存款不断上升，全县农村总存款达三百多万元，平均每户三十多元。
    这样严重的旱灾，取得了这样伟大的胜利，好像是神话故事一样，令人难以置信。但是，这是活生生的事实，雷南县六十万人民都可以做证人。如果拿去年的旱灾和抗旱斗争的胜利与五十年前的光绪二十八年作个对比的话，就更为明显了。那一年仅仅旱了半年多的时间，就出现土地荒芜、民不聊生的严重灾荒。据县志记载，当时饿死的人数以万计；这次旱灾连续了一年又四个月时间，比光绪二十八年的旱情严重得多，但灾痕不见，只见丰收，这究竟是什么力量战胜了乾坤？是什么力量把大旱之年变成了丰收之年？这是毛泽东思想的光辉，是总路线的威力，是毛泽东思想和总路线武装起来的人民，以大无畏的英雄气概，取得的伟大胜利。向大自然开战
    1958年冬季，雷南县的旱情已经发展到相当严重的地步：冬薯旱死了四成，坡地作物无法抢种，早造水稻无水办田。在这种灾情威胁之下，人们没有气馁，他们的抗旱斗争，说明人可以改造世界，人可以征服自然，人的主观能动性蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量。他们高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想武器，向旱灾宣战。他们深信，天大的困难顶不住一个“干”字。在大旱临头之际，全县有二十多万人，夜以继日地担水抢种木薯，抢种甘蔗，抢救冬薯。经过那一段艰苦奋斗，总共种下七万亩甘蔗，四万亩木薯和五万亩杂粮，还救活了十万亩受旱的冬薯，赢得了抗旱斗争的第一次胜利。但是，苍天无眼，还要与人作对，到去年开春时，旱灾更严重了。春节前抢种的甘蔗、木薯大部分被旱伤旱死，早稻二十五万亩有十万亩缺水办田。面对这种困难，这样严重的旱患，有些人开始动摇了。正在这个时候，雷南县委又用毛泽东思想和总路线来武装全县人民，大讲人定胜天，大讲事在人为，反复宣传人的作用，强调人可以创造历史，创造世界。为什么人不能改变历史，改造世界呢？可以的。我们告诉全县人民：旱灾不可怕，苍天不可怕，最可怕的是人们自己灭了自己的志气，灭了自己的威风，灭了自己战胜灾难的信心。当毛泽东思想和总路线精神一经被群众接受之后，人们的精神面貌焕然一新，祖国大陆的最南端又出现抗旱斗争的热烈场面。人们把反悲观论、反懦夫思想的斗争与战胜旱患的向大自然的斗争结合起来了。思想高一尺，生产高一丈，汹涌澎湃的抗旱运动如火如荼地展开了。在去年春季，雷南县白天是人山人海，入夜是灯火辉煌，方圆三千九百平方公里的南国山河，形成了一个抗旱斗争的沸腾大海。
      “哪怕天公不低头”
    终究是人力大于天，天公旱死一亩，人们补种二亩；一丈深的水井干了，人们再挖二丈深的水井。“人民吃了雷公胆，那怕天公不低头”！革命的人民，从几丈深的水井提水灌田，从几十里之外的地方去担水抢种，在几十里的大石山上挖渠开河，引水百多里来保苗保秧。经过日日夜夜的突击，又一次把天公制服了。早稻在这样严重的灾情之下，比1958年早造多种二万多亩，甘蔗在旱死七万多亩之后，又补种了十一万多亩，甘薯面积也比1958年有所增加。英勇的雷南人民被战斗胜利的喜悦感动了，人们更加信服毛泽东思想和总路线的巨大威力了。
    早造抗旱抢种的胜利鼓舞着全县人民，在抢种抢插之后，人们又掀起了抗旱保苗的高潮。全县十三万人马驻在田边，日夜车水抗灾。在插秧后不久，全县除十五万亩早稻，有1958年新建水库的水利保证之外，还有十一万亩早稻、十万亩春薯、十一万亩甘蔗需要车水或担水保苗。每亩作物担水保苗一次要用水四百担，那么三十二万亩作物，抗一次旱就需要担一亿二千八百万担水。全县十三万人投入抗旱，每浇一次水，平均每人要挑一千担水。浇一次水只能保水十天，那么一人一天就要挑一百担水。雷南人人几乎是肩不离担，担不离肩，日夜苦战。
    严重的旱灾，繁重的劳动，逼着人们大搞工具改革。他们把人工担水改为用水车运水，把人工打水改为用畜力提水。特别是抗旱斗争促进了水利建设，如大水桥水库的渠道从附城通到迈陈，须要通过一座二十八里长、一丈六尺多深的大石山——华丰岭，原计划三年才能打通渠道，但在大旱临头之际，人们仅仅用了一个月时间，就在二十八里长的大石山上打通了一条简便的渠道，把流水引到迈陈，保证了迈陈公社八千亩早稻的收成。
    大自然在软弱的人们面前是残酷的，在刚强的人们面前却是驯服的。雷南县1959年的早造经过百日苦战，不仅没有减产，而且取得了比1958年早造更大的丰收。稻谷总产量比1958年增产18％，其他杂粮作物都有所增产，人民的生活水平比大旱之前还略有提高。
    胜利接着胜利
    早造大丰收并没有结束抗旱战斗，入夏之后，干旱越来越严重了。自清明节前下了几十毫米小雨后，直到小暑，又足足一百多天是万里无云。但是，雷南人民是不可征服的。全县除甘蔗旱死缺种无法补种外，其他作物都是边死边种，今天旱死明天又种。英雄的谭头公社社员们种下了一万多亩坡稻，以后旱死了，他们又补种杂粮，杂粮旱死了，又一次一次地补种甘薯，直到最后土皮旱硬了，旱到犁不能犁、挖不能挖的时候，他们就用铁铲、十字镐，一镐一镐地凿开坚硬的土地，一棵一棵抢种下去。这场抗旱斗争一直延续到立秋前三天，全县部分地区才降了一些中雨。县委抓住这一个一刻千金的大好时机，领导群众在半个月之内抢插了五十六万亩晚稻，抢种了四十八万亩秋薯，使晚稻面积比1958年扩大了十万亩，秋薯面积扩大了三十八万亩，达到了县委预先计划的多种多收的目的。然而，这次下雨很不平衡，东北部雨大，西南部依然是烈日炎炎。但是，不管有雨也好，无雨也好，雷南人民反正是不依靠天老爷吃饭的，有雨就种，无雨就抗，总路线出干劲，这是永远不可征服的。迈陈公社的许家寮大队，去年一年没有下过一次十毫米的雨，然而他们继续高举着大跃进的旗帜。太旱了，稻谷种不成了，他们便全部改种甘薯；以后甘薯旱了，他们便依靠五百八十二个田头井抗旱；田头井不久也都旱干了，他们又重新挖了四百二十个，四百二十个又快旱干了，他们就分工住在田头，有一瓢水就取一瓢水去淋甘薯。经过这样艰苦斗争，虽然稻谷全部无收，但是甘薯增产了四倍。最近，县委到这个大队去了解，社员们不仅前段生活很好，而且现在平均每人还有一千多斤甘薯干。社员笑道：“叫它旱吧！再旱一年，我们还有吃的。”
    晚造抗旱大决战，又取得了晚造的大丰收。稻谷增产将近四成，秋薯增产了一倍以上，其他如盐业、渔业、副业等都有很大的增产。
    目前雷南县人民继续以抗旱为纲，一手抓多种，一手抓高产，大闹春耕生产。全县已经扩大早稻面积八万多亩，办田四万多亩，同时对七万亩落后田、边远田、山坑田进行了一系列的改造工作，为今年粮食大丰收打下了基础。
