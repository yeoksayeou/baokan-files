Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 26th: The Cuban people have held rallies and demonstrations to protest against the U.S.-instigated anti-communist propaganda, which aims to split the Cuban people and create pretexts for armed intervention in Cuba.

    On the 25th, more than three thousand workers, students, and residents held a demonstration around the television station where the counter-revolutionary commentator Conte Agüero was conducting anti-communist propaganda. This Conte, who was bought by the United States, had previously collaborated with the Batista dictatorship in opposing the rebel army. When he saw the demonstrating masses, he secretly fled through a small alley. The angry masses shouted: Oppose anti-communist propaganda, swear to defend the motherland!

    Subsequently, a mass rally with thousands of students participating was held at the University of Havana. Cuvilla, Chairman of the University Student Federation, pointed out at the meeting that the divisive propaganda movement is occurring at a time when the revolution needs the people to unite to resist foreign aggression. He announced on behalf of the University Student Federation that we will never allow any more conspiracies to confuse and create divisions under any pretext.

    The capital continues to receive countless telegrams of protest from workers, farmers, and other social strata across the country. Residents of Belsayes said in a telegram that we condemn this shameful anti-communist conspiracy, which is taking place at the same time as the intensified burning of sugar cane and counter-revolutionary sabotage.

    National newspapers continue to condemn the instigators of anti-communist propaganda, the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. "Revolución" published an editorial today pointing out that anti-communism is merely a pretext for imperialist monopoly groups to invade countries fighting for sovereignty and liberation from the oppression of imperialist monopoly groups.

    Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, published an article in today's "Hoy" stating that anti-communism is a disguise and a new pretext for U.S. imperialism's intervention and control of Latin America under the Monroe Doctrine, and is the last political weapon against national sovereignty.

    Roca pointed out that the Cuban people are no longer fooled by anti-communist propaganda, and they are shouting the slogan that all Cubans are proud of: Swear to defend the motherland!

    反共宣传的勾当骗不了人
    古巴人民怒斥美国制造侵略借口
    哈瓦那群众示威抗议反动分子诽谤活动
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　古巴人民举行集会和示威游行，抗议美国嗾使的企图分裂古巴人民和为武装干涉古巴制造借口的反共宣传。
    25日，三千多工人、学生和居民在反革命评论员孔特·阿古埃罗进行反共宣传的电视台周围举行了示威游行。这个为美国收买的孔特，过去曾经和巴蒂斯塔独裁政权在反对起义军中进行合作。当他看到示威群众时，便偷偷地从一个小巷中逃跑了。愤怒的群众高呼：反对反共宣传，誓死保卫祖国！
    随后，在哈瓦那大学举行了有数千名学生参加的群众集会。大学生联合会主席库维拉在大会上指出，分裂的宣传运动发生在革命需要人民一致团结起来抵抗外国侵略的时刻。他代表大学生联合会宣布说，我们决不允许在任何借口下继续进行企图混淆视听和制造分裂的阴谋活动。
    首都继续收到全国各地的工人、农民及其他社会阶层的无数表示抗议的电报。贝尔萨列斯的居民在电报中说，我们谴责同加紧焚烧甘蔗和反革命破坏活动的同时进行的这种可耻的反共阴谋活动。
    全国各报继续谴责反共宣传的嗾使者美帝国主义的阴谋。“革命报”今天发表社论指出，反共只不过是帝国主义垄断集团企图侵略为争取主权和从帝国主义垄断集团的压迫下解放出来而斗争的国家的借口罢了。
    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加在今天的“今日报”上发表文章说，反共是美帝国主义干涉和控制拉丁美洲的门罗主义的掩饰和新的借口，是反对民族主权的最后的政治武器。
    罗加指出，古巴人民已经不再上反共宣传的当了，他们高呼所有古巴人民感到骄傲的口号：誓死保卫祖国。
