    Chengdu Huangwajie Public Service Station Handles All Household Affairs, Allowing Employees to Focus on Production Without Worries

    (Our Report) Chengdu Huangwajie residents in Sichuan Province, under the leadership of the street party committee, raised funds and contributed their own furniture to establish 48 street public service stations, becoming a powerful assistant to state-owned commercial organizations in managing the people's economic life.

    Huangwajie is an ordinary residential area in Chengdu, with more than 11,000 households, of which over 80% are employees' families and construction workers. With the vigorous development of socialist construction, last year alone, more than 1,800 residents joined the street-run factories. Some families had both husband and wife working, and their housework urgently needed to be taken care of. In the face of the new situation, the street party committee decided to take measures to actively develop social services and organize the people's economic life well, according to the needs of the people.

    When starting to organize the people's economic life, the Huangwajie party committee organized discussions with street activists. During the discussions, it was unanimously agreed that organizing the people's economic life was the people's own business, and they should do it themselves, and not simply rely on the state. After unifying their thinking, they then organized some socially idle laborers on a voluntary basis, raised funds themselves, contributed their own furniture, and established 48 various service stations and points in a simple and economical way. The service stations provide a variety of services, handling everything from weddings and funerals to household chores. Specific items include laundry, cooking, renovation and repairs, subscription to newspapers and magazines, savings deposits, caring for the sick, decocting medicine, weddings and funerals, slaughtering chickens and stewing ducks, helping with moving, repairing houses, and hiring babysitters, totaling 212 items.

    In order to make the street public service stations better serve production, the street party committee also put forward the requirement to the service stations that "where there is production, there are service personnel." This requirement immediately became the practical action of each service station; under the unified dispatch of the service headquarters, they were flexible and diverse, striving to be proactive, caring about production, and meticulous. According to the needs of the masses, the service stations sent boiling water, dyeing and cleaning, and hairdressing service teams to factories and offices, providing services during the day when needed and at night when needed. At present, many employees here have been able to go out early and return late, without cooking at home, and can eat hot meals. Not long ago, the production of the quartz powder factory in this area was very tight, and it was difficult for workers to find time to go home for meals. After obtaining the consent of the factory, the service station took the initiative to process steamed buns for them and send them on time, which strongly supported production.

    The spirit of the street public service station personnel, who are proactive, conscientious, active, willing to work, and do not fear hardship in serving the masses, has been unanimously praised by the masses. Some residents entrust the temporary care of their children going to and from school to the service station when they go out to work. Some families participate in production, and their return times vary, so they hand over the keys to the service station for safekeeping. Some residents in the area entrust the service station to handle matters such as decorating the new house, cleaning, and adding miscellaneous items when they get married. Many residents are very moved and praise them, saying: "With the service station, everything is easy to handle!" Since the establishment of the Huangwajie station, the various service stations have received more than 12,000 verbal compliments from the masses, and have also received a large number of letters of praise, poems, and award flags and certificates.

    The Huangwajie public service station actively cooperates with commercial departments in its work, exchanging information and understanding customer needs. Commercial departments also regard helping the service station as their bounden duty, providing guidance and assistance in business technology, management, and raw material supply, so that the service station quickly improves its service quality and increases the number of service items. For example, originally each service station was limited by cooking technology and had no food service items, but these service items were urgently needed by the masses; now, through the form of cooperation between state-owned commercial departments and service stations, food service items have been set up to meet the urgent needs of the masses.

    The street residents of Longmenhao area, Nanan District, Chongqing City, have established a childcare network with various forms, including full-time care, part-time care, temporary nurseries, family childcare groups, and children's teams organizing scattered children's activities. This temporary nursery is located on the main road to the cinema and across the river to the city. If anyone needs to watch a movie or go to the city to do errands, they can temporarily entrust their children here.

    成都黄瓦街公共服务站包办家务样样俱全
    职工无牵无挂专心生产
    本报讯　四川省成都市黄瓦街群众在街道党委的领导下，自筹资金，自己出家具，办起了四十八个街道公共服务站，成了国营商业组织人民经济生活的一个有力助手。
    黄瓦街是成都市的一个普通住宅区，共有一万一千多户居民，其中80％以上是职工家属和建筑工人。随着社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，去年仅参加街道民办工厂的居民就有一千八百多人。有的家庭男女双方都参加了工作，他们的家务迫切需要有人料理。在新形势面前，街道党委根据人民群众的需要，决定采取措施，积极发展社会服务事业，把人民经济生活组织好。
    在开始着手组织人民经济生活的时候，黄瓦街党委组织曾吸收街道积极分子进行了讨论。在讨论中，一致认为：组织人民经济生活是人民自己的事情，自己的事情应该自己办，不能单纯依赖国家。在统一思想认识以后，接着，就按照自愿的原则，把一些社会闲散劳动力组织起来，自己筹资金，自己出家具，因陋就简地建立了各种服务站、点四十八个。服务站的服务项目是多样的，不论红白喜事，家务打杂，需要干啥就干啥。具体项目包括洗衣、煮饭、翻新补旧、代订书报、代办储蓄、照顾病人、煎茶熬药、婚丧喜事、杀鸡炖鸭、帮办搬家、修膳房屋、代雇保姆等二百一十二项。
    为了使街道公共服务站更好地为生产服务，街道党委还向服务站提出了“哪里有生产，那里就有服务员”的要求。这一要求立即成了各个服务站的实际行动；他们在服务总站的统一调度下，做到灵活多样，力争主动，关心生产，无微不至。根据群众的需要，服务站把开水、洗染、理发等服务组派到工厂、机关中去，做到白天需要白天供应，晚上需要晚上供应。目前，这里的许多职工已经作到了早出晚归，不动炊烟，可以吃到热菜热饭。不久前，驻在这个地区的石英粉厂生产很紧张，工人们很难抽出时间回家吃饭，服务站在取得厂方同意后，主动为他们加工馒头，按时送去，有力地支援了生产。
    街道公共服务站人员主动认真积极肯干、不辞劳苦地为群众服务的精神，获得群众的一致好评。有些居民出去工作，把自己小孩上学、放学的临时照管都委托给服务站。有的一家人参加了生产，回家时间先后不一，就把钥匙交给服务站代管。辖区内一些居民结婚，把布置新房、打扫清洁、添置杂物等事情，也委托服务站办理。许多居民十分感动，表扬他们说：“有了服务站，啥事都好办！”黄瓦街自建站以来，各服务站已受到群众口头表扬一万二千多次，还收到了大批表扬的信件、诗歌和奖旗、奖状。
    黄瓦街公共服务站在工作中主动和商业部门协作配合，互通来往，了解顾客需要。商业部门也把对服务站的帮助当作自己应尽的义务，在业务技术、经营管理、原料供应等方面进行指导帮助，使服务站很快地提高了服务质量，服务项目日益增多。如原来各个服务站限于烹调技术，都没有饮食服务项目，而这些服务项目又为群众所急需；现在通过国营商业部门和服务站搞协作的形式，办起了饮食服务项目，满足了群众的急需。（附图片）
    重庆市南岸区龙门浩地区街道居民建立了托儿网，形式多种多样，有全托也有半托，有临时托儿站也有家庭托儿组，还有组织散居儿童活动的幼儿队。这个临时托儿站是设在影院和过江进城的要道上，如果谁需要看一场电影或要进城去办事，就可把小孩临时托在这里。
