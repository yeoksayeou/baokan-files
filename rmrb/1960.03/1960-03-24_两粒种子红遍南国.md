Two Seeds Redden the Southland
    Yu Li
    Guangdong has entered the busy season of rice transplanting, and the most popular improved variety is "Dwarf Nante." As early as the spring sowing season, various regions sent letters and telegrams requesting the seed management department to allocate this improved variety, resulting in a situation of great demand and short supply. It is said that this improved variety has the advantages of being lodging-resistant, fertilizer-tolerant, having large panicles, heavy grains, high yield, short growing period, and strong adaptability. These advantages precisely meet the requirements of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" at this stage.

    This well-known rice variety in the province was still unknown four years ago. Because of its short stature, growing among the "Nante" plants, which were considered "darlings of heaven" at the time, people were unaware of its existence. Later, with the promotion of close planting, people encountered the contradiction between close planting, high fertilization, and the existing rice varieties' intolerance to fertilizer and susceptibility to lodging. People urgently needed to find a new variety that was fertilizer-tolerant, lodging-resistant, and high-yielding. Thus, Dwarf Nante was discovered, cultivated, and promoted "in accordance with the laws of nature and the needs of the people." In just four years, its reputation spread like wildfire, and some people likened it to "two grains of rice reddening the world."

    Interestingly, four years ago, Dwarf Nante was just two unnamed rice plants. It was during the early rice harvest of 1956 when a heavy rain fell, and large areas of rice lodged. "Fierce wind reveals the strong grass." Only two sturdy and short rice plants stood tall on the edge of the field, seeming to look down upon everything. Hong Qunying, a technician and young Communist Party member from Dongcang Agricultural Cooperative in Chao'an County, discovered it, saved the seeds, and painstakingly cultivated them. During this period, it was neglected by some people because of its short stature, high fertilizer consumption, and susceptibility to rice blast. However, the Party organization actively encouraged and supported Hong Qunying's experiments. Under Hong Qunying's careful cultivation, "Dwarf Nante" increasingly and stubbornly demonstrated its superiority. Now, it has ascended to the throne of the best rice variety. Once it takes the stage, many varieties in the province will have to admit defeat. This year, more than one million mu of rice fields in Guangdong are planted with this variety, and it is expected to expand to 20 million mu by 1962. By then, many rice varieties will be eliminated.

    The journey of Dwarf Nante from obscurity to fame in the South, from two seeds to 20 million mu, and the victory of one variety over more than 6,000 varieties is truly extraordinary. However, it is not surprising. New things inevitably replace old ones, which is the law of development, independent of people's will. New things in life grow day by day, invincible, and no one can stop them. However, in the process of the growth of new things, people are not in the position of bystanders. People who are aware that new things will inevitably grow will always stand on the side of new things, taking it as their responsibility to support and accelerate the development of new things, just like Hong Qunying cultivated Dwarf Nante. Such people are the promoters of progress in life.

    We Communists and all promoters of progress, must not only always represent new things, clearing the way for their growth and development, but also be aware that life begets life, newness adds to newness, and things emerge endlessly, thereby consciously preparing conditions for the birth of even newer things. The reason why "Dwarf Nante" has become the best variety is that it was discovered, cultivated, and promoted "in accordance with the laws of nature and the needs of the people" under the current farming technology conditions. It can be predicted that with the further development of productive forces and the completion of agricultural technology transformation, newer and better varieties will inevitably replace it. Consciously seeing this trend, our thinking can forever follow the development of objective forms and forever become promoters of revolution.

    两粒种子红遍南国
    于厘
    广东已经进入插秧大忙期，最吃香的良种是“矮脚南特”。早在春播期间，各地就函电交驰，要求种子管理部门调拨这个良种，真是僧多粥少，求过于供。据说，这个良种具有不倒伏、耐肥、穗大、粒重、高产、生长期短、适应力强的优点。这些优点正好符合“农业八字宪法”现阶段的要求。
    这个闻名全省的水稻良种，四年前，还是寂寂无闻的。因为它个子矮，夹杂在当时被人们视为“天之骄子”的“南特”的株行间生长起来，人们根本不知道它的存在。后来，因为推广小科密植，人们碰到了密植、肥多与现有水稻品种不耐肥、容易倒伏的矛盾。人们迫切需要寻求一个耐肥、不倒伏、高产的新品种。于是，矮脚南特便“顺乎天理，应乎人情”被人们发现、栽培、推广。前后不过四年，它的声誉就不胫而走，有人将它喻为“两粒谷子红遍天下”。
    说来真有意思，四年前，矮脚南特还只是两株无姓无名的水稻。那是1956年的早造将近收割的时候，下了一场大雨，大片水稻都倒伏了，“疾风知劲草”，独有两株粗壮低矮的水稻在田塍边屹立，大有傲视一切的味道。潮安县东仓农业社技术员、青年共产党员洪群英发现了它，把种子留下来，加以苦心培育。这其间，曾因为它矮小、吃肥多、容易患稻热病而被一些人忽视。可是，党组织积极鼓励支持洪群英的试验。在洪群英的仔细栽培下，“矮脚南特”便越来越顽强地显示出它的优越性。现在，它已经跨上了目前的最优良的水稻品种的宝座。它一登台，全省许多品种都要甘拜下风。广东今年早造种植这个品种的稻田有一百多万亩，预计到1962年将扩大至二千万亩。到那时，很多水稻品种都要被淘汰了。
    矮脚南特之从寂寂无闻到誉满南方，从两粒种子扩大到二千万亩，以一个品种战胜六千多个品种，这个过程真是不简单。然而，也并不奇怪。新的事物从来必然代替旧的，这是事物发展的规律，不以人们的意志为转移的。生活中新生的东西，一天天成长起来，不可战胜，谁要阻止它也不行。然而，在新生事物成长过程中，人不是处于第三者的地位的。自觉到新生事物必然成长的人，永远会站在新生事物的那一边，以扶植、支持新生事物，加速新生事物的发展进程为己任，就像洪群英培育矮脚南特那样。这种人是生活中的促进派。
    我们共产党人和所有的促进派，不但要永远代表着新生事物，为新生事物的壮大、发展扫清道路，而且还要自觉到生者再生，新上加新，层出不穷，从而有意识地为更新鲜的事物的诞生，准备条件。“矮脚南特”之所以成为最优良的品种，是因为它是在目前的耕作技术条件下，“顺乎天理，应乎人情”，而被人发现、培育、推广的。可以预料，随着生产力的进一步发展，随着农业技术改造的完成，必然有更新、更优秀的品种代替它。自觉地看到这种趋势，我们的思想就能永远跟着客观形式的发展而发展，永远成为革命的促进派。
