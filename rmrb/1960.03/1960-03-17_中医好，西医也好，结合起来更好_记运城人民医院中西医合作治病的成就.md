    Traditional Chinese Medicine is Good, Western Medicine is Also Good, Combining Them is Even Better
    -- On the Achievements of Sino-Western Cooperative Medical Treatment at Yuncheng People's Hospital
    By our reporters Sha Yin and Pei Zhi
    In the past two years, Yuncheng People's Hospital in Shanxi has achieved great success in Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment and in exploring the establishment of a new medicine of the motherland. More than fifty intractable internal medicine diseases, such as cerebral hemorrhage, tetanus, purulent meningitis, and leukemia, and more than a dozen relatively difficult surgical diseases, such as esophageal cancer and bone tuberculosis, have all been treated with very satisfactory results through Sino-Western cooperative treatment. The masses in Yuncheng County praised this hospital, saying that there is "one fast, three less" for treatment here: fast recovery, less pain, less money spent, and less work time delayed.

    The Beginning of Cooperation
    In 1954, Yuncheng People's Hospital criticized the erroneous ideas of underestimating, discriminating against, and excluding traditional Chinese medicine, but the ideological knots in the minds of Western medicine practitioners were not untied. Many people still said, "Grass roots and tree bark can't solve problems." Some also believed that researching and sorting out the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine was a matter for specialized research institutions and simply ignored it. Sometimes, when Western medicine practitioners asked traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to treat illnesses, it was either to push away intractable diseases or to try to "checkmate" traditional Chinese medicine.

    The hospital's Party branch carefully analyzed the ideological situation of the medical staff and believed that if traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine could not reach a unified understanding ideologically, it would be impossible to cooperate closely in treating diseases. However, it would also be impossible to solve their ideological problems simply by talking and holding meetings. Therefore, on the one hand, they organized everyone to visit exhibitions of traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, and technological innovation achievements in Beijing, Baoding, and other places to liberate their minds and broaden their horizons. On the other hand, they invited responsible comrades from the provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees to give reports, theoretically analyzing and demonstrating the important significance of Sino-Western cooperation. In this way, everyone began to change their thinking, feeling that traditional Chinese medicine might indeed be better than Western medicine in some areas.

    Seeing that everyone's thinking had begun to change, the Party branch seized the opportunity and launched a campaign to study traditional Chinese medicine throughout the hospital. First, a scientific research institute with the Party branch as its core was established, and specialized research groups were also established in each department. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were mobilized to compile collections of effective prescriptions, secret prescriptions, and lectures on acupuncture and moxibustion and explanations of materia medica. Eight veteran traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were also invited from the countryside to specialize in research and guidance. In this way, the movement to study traditional Chinese medicine was vigorously launched throughout the hospital.

    Taking the First Step
    Song Yongxin was originally a Western medicine doctor who did not believe in traditional Chinese medicine early on. Once, the attending physician asked him to see a patient with a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, and he became angry upon hearing this and walked away from the patient. In 1958, when the hospital was vigorously promoting the study of traditional Chinese medicine, he began to change his mind. Later, he also saw the results of Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment in fraternal hospitals, and he became even more enlightened. Once, a patient with appendicitis came to the hospital, and he originally thought that traditional Chinese medicine could not cure it and that Western medicine would have to perform surgery. Traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhou Dingxin suggested using acupuncture treatment. Although he was not very convinced, he agreed. Dr. Zhou inserted a needle into the "Zusanli Xia Er Cun acupoint" on the patient's left leg. Not long after the needle was inserted, the patient stopped complaining of abdominal pain. This aroused his interest in acupuncture, and he carefully tested and analyzed the patient's condition, temperature, total white blood cell count, and changes in neutrophilic white blood cells before and after treatment, theoretically affirming the course and efficacy of acupuncture in treating appendicitis. The hospital also issued a commendation to praise him.

    Soon, the hospital had another case of Sino-Western cooperative treatment of leukemia: One day, a patient with a pale complexion, difficulty breathing, and a white blood cell count of more than 80,000 came in. Both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine doctors felt it was a difficult case and suggested that the patient go to Xi'an for treatment. However, Cheng Zhenshan, the secretary of the Party branch and president of the hospital, firmly opposed it. He said that they must not allow such a dangerous patient to take a train and travel a long distance to worsen their condition, and they must cooperate between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to save the patient. The doctors listened to President Cheng's words and studied all night, proposing a plan for Western medicine diagnosis and testing, combined with acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine treatment, and immediately began treating the patient. After three days, there were significant results.

    The successful Sino-Western cooperative treatment of two serious illnesses solved the ideological problems of the medical staff. They came to the conclusion that Western medicine is good, traditional Chinese medicine is also good, and the combination of the two is even better. This was the first step on the road to comprehensive Sino-Western cooperation.

    New Sprouts Everywhere
    As more and more cases of Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment and improved medical technology emerged, the in-depth development of Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine and Sino-Western cooperation was further promoted. From doctors and physicians to medical and nursing staff, the entire hospital was generally involved in the wave of apprenticeship and learning traditional Chinese medicine. New things in Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment also appeared every day. Xue Zunhua, a doctor in the Department of Internal Medicine, had previously studied traditional Chinese medicine for four years, but had not memorized a single prescription or acupoint. Later, he also changed, reading traditional Chinese medicine books every day and consulting traditional Chinese medicine practitioners everywhere, and he also made achievements in Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment. He used the Western medicine method of analyzing pharmacology to analyze an often unused prescription in the past – Hou's Black Powder – and found that the ingredients of this traditional Chinese medicine prescription were very similar to the ingredients of Western medicines for treating high blood pressure, and that some of the ingredients also had physiotherapy effects for thrombotic cerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, he prescribed it to a patient with cerebral hemorrhage, and the disease was cured. Dr. Xue explained the scientific basis of this prescription using Western medicine theory, and the facts proved that his analysis was correct. Later, he continuously treated more than a dozen more cases, and the curative effect was very good. There are many such achievements in Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment.

    They also widely used ear acupuncture therapy, which can treat many diseases by simply inserting needles into the ears. In the past, when they looked for acupoints on the ears, they relied on experience or looked for pressure pain points, which were sometimes not very accurate, affecting the efficacy. In 1958, they invented an "ear acupoint tester" with electrical equipment, which used current to detect acupuncture points in the ear, allowing for very accurate needling. Now they can use ear acupuncture therapy to cure more than fifty diseases.

    The nursing staff of this hospital also have a great enthusiasm for learning traditional Chinese medicine. Most nurses have learned thirty to fifty-eight acupuncture points. They have also learned various acupuncture analgesia techniques, which can relieve patients' pain without taking medicine.

    Abundant Achievements
    The time for Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment at Yuncheng People's Hospital is not long, but it has achieved fruitful results. We browsed through their several thick stacks of reports on Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment and found many amazing achievements.

    The course of treatment for many diseases has been shortened after Sino-Western cooperative treatment. Just taking the thirty cases of influenza, thirty-five cases of exudative pleurisy, forty-six cases of bone tuberculosis, and one hundred and sixty cases of appendicitis that they have cured in the past year as examples, a total of 8,205 days have been saved, and this time will naturally be invested in production.

    Now, it is difficult to distinguish which doctor at Yuncheng People's Hospital is a traditional Chinese medicine doctor and which is a Western medicine doctor. No Western medicine doctor does not know acupuncture and does not use traditional Chinese medicine, and no traditional Chinese medicine doctor does not use Western medicine. What is especially gratifying is that they have made in-depth observations, research, and summaries of the process and results of each Sino-Western cooperative medical treatment, writing them into papers. The 277 papers we saw all scientifically demonstrated the therapeutic principle of Sino-Western combination for a certain disease. This is no small achievement. (Attached picture)

    中医好，西医也好，结合起来更好
    ——记运城人民医院中西医合作治病的成就
    本报记者　莎荫　培植
    山西运城人民医院近两年来在中西医合作治病、探讨建立祖国新医学方面，取得了很大的成绩。像脑溢血、破伤风、化脓性脑膜炎、白血病等五十多种棘手的内科病和食道癌、骨结核等十几种比较难治的外科病，他们经过中西医合作治疗，都得到了非常满意的效果。运城县的群众称赞这个医院说，在这里治病有一快三少：好的快、痛苦少、花钱少、耽误劳动少。
    合作的开端
    1954年，运城人民医院批判过轻视、歧视和排斥中医的错误思想，但是西医思想上的疙瘩并没有解开。不少人还说：“草根树皮解决不了问题。”有人还认为研究、整理祖国医学遗产是专门研究机构的事，干脆不管。有时西医请中医治病，不是想把棘手的病推出去，就是想“将”中医的“军”。
    医院党支部认真分析了医务人员的思想状况，认为中西医如果不能在思想上统一认识，要在治病上亲密合作，是办不到的事。但是，只凭谈谈话、开开会解决他们的思想问题，也是办不到的事。于是，一面组织大家到北京、保定等地参观中医中药和技术革新成就展览会，解放思想，开扩眼界，一面又请省、专、县党委的负责同志作报告，从理论上分析、论证中西医合作的重要意义。这样，大家在思想上开始转变了，觉得中医有的地方也许真比西医好。
    党支部见大家的思想开始扭转，就趁热打铁，在全院开展学习中医的运动。首先成立以党支部为核心的科学研究所，各科室也成立专题研究小组。同时发动中医编写验方、秘方汇集和针灸讲义、本草表解等，又从农村请来八位老中医，专作研究和指导工作。这么一来，学习中医的运动就在全院热热闹闹地展开了。
    走上第一步
    宋永信原是个西医大夫，早先不信中医。有一次，主治大夫叫他和中医大夫一起给病人看病，他一听就火了，撇开病人就走。1958年，医院里大闹学中医时，他才开始转变过来。后来又到兄弟医院看了中西医合作治病的成果，心里就更亮堂了。有一次，医院里来了一位阑尾炎病人，他原以为中医治不了，还得西医开刀。中医周鼎新大夫建议用针灸治疗。他虽然还不太相信，却也同意了。周大夫在病人的左腿“足三里下二寸穴”上扎了一针。扎针不久，病人就不闹肚痛了。这一下，他对针灸发生了兴趣，就把治疗前后的病状、体温、白血球总数的变化和中性白血球的变化，作了仔细化验和分析，从理论上肯定了针灸治阑尾炎的疗程和疗效。医院也出喜报表扬他。
    不久，医院又发生了一件中西医合作治疗白血病的事：一天，来了位面色黄白、呼吸困难、白血球增至八万多的病人。中西医大夫都感到棘手，提出让病人到西安去治。但是党支部书记兼院长程震山坚决反对，他说，决不能让这样危险的病人再去坐火车、跑长路加重病情，一定要中西医合作挽救病人。大夫们听了程院长的话，当夜通宵研究，提出西医诊断、化验，针灸、中药治疗的方案，立即动手治病。过了三天，就有显著疗效。
    中西医合作治好两例重病，给医务人员解决了思想问题。他们产生了这样一种看法：西医好，中医也好，两种结合起来更好。这在中西医全面合作的路上走了第一步。
    处处新芽
    随着中西医合作治病、提高医疗技术水平的事情相继出现，更加促进了西医学中医、中西医合作的深入开展。全院从大夫、医师到医务、护理人员普遍地卷入了拜师傅、学中医的浪潮。中西医合作治病的新事也天天出现。内科薛遵化大夫以前学了四年中医，还没有记下一个处方和一个穴位，后来也变了，天天看中医书籍，处处向中医请教，在中西医合作治病方面也做出了成绩。他用西医对药理的分析方法分析了过去中医也不常用的一个处方——侯氏黑散，发现这付中药的成份和治高血压的西药成份很相近，而且有些药的成份，对于血拴性脑溢血病还有理疗作用。于是，就给一位脑溢血病人服用，结果治好了病。薛大夫用西医的理论解释了这个处方的科学根据，事实证明他的分析是对的。以后又连续治了十几例，疗效都很好。像这样中西医合作治病的成果是很多的。
    他们还广泛应用了耳针疗法，只在耳朵上针灸，能治许多病。过去，他们在耳朵上找穴位，是凭经验或是找压痛点，有时不太准确，影响疗效。1958年，他们发明了一个有电气设备的“耳穴测验器”，利用电流探测出耳部的针灸穴位，可以很准确的扎针。现在他们已能用耳针疗法治好五十多种病。
    这个医院的护理人员学习中医的劲头也很大。大部分护士学会了三十到五十八个针灸穴位。他们还学会了各种针灸止痛术，不用吃药可以给病人止痛。
    丰硕的成果
    运城人民医院中西医合作治病的时间还不长，但是收到了丰硕的成果。我们翻阅了他们的几叠厚厚的中西医合作治病的报告书，发现了很多惊人的成绩。
    很多病症的疗程经过中西医合作治疗后，缩短了时间。仅仅拿他们一年来治好的三十例流感、三十五例渗出性胸膜炎、四十六例骨结核、一百六十例阑尾炎计算，加起来共节省了八千二百零五天，这些时间自然会投到生产中去了。
    现在，运城人民医院的大夫，已经很难分辨出哪位是中医，哪位是西医。没有一位西医不会针灸、不会用中药，也没有一位中医不会用西药。尤其可喜的是，他们把每次中西医合作治病的过程和结果，作了深入的观察、研究和总结，写成论文，我们看到的二百七十七篇论文，每一篇都科学地论证了中西医结合对某一病症的治疗原理。这是一个不小的成绩。（附图片）
