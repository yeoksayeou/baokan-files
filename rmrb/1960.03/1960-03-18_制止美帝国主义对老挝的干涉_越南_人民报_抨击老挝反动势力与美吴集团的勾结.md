Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 17th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, accusing the Lao reactionary clique of engaging in a "dangerous collusion" with the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in military affairs. The commentary stated that if US imperialist interference is not stopped in time, and the collusion between the Lao extremist reactionary clique and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the Geneva Accords is not stopped, Laos will be in an extremely dangerous situation.

The commentary pointed out that the Lao Royal Army is currently conducting large-scale "sweeps" in Lower Laos. This "sweep" by the Lao reactionary clique is to prepare for the upcoming "general election," using bayonets and guns to threaten the Lao people and force them to vote for their people. However, this is not the only purpose.

The commentary said that the Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Army Forces, White, recently inspected Lower Laos accompanied by officers of the Ngo Dinh Diem army, and held secret talks with Lao Defense Minister Phoumi Nosavan and the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests." Subsequently, the Ngo Dinh Diem army and the Lao Royal Army conducted mutually coordinated "sweeps" on the Lao-Vietnamese border. Under the instigation of US imperialism, the Lao extremist reactionary clique is further colluding with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which is very dangerous. This will turn Laos into a US war base like South Vietnam, used to threaten the peace-loving countries of Indochina and undermine peace and national liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

    制止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉
    越南“人民报”抨击老挝反动势力与美吴集团的勾结
    据新华社河内17日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，指责老挝反动集团正在同美国—吴庭艳集团进行军事上的“危险的勾结”。评论说，如果不及时制止美帝国主义的干涉，制止老挝极端反动的集团同吴庭艳集团为破坏日内瓦协议而进行的勾结，那末，老挝将会陷入极其危险的境地。
    评论指出，目前老挝王国军队正在下寮大举“扫荡”。老挝反动集团的这种“扫荡”，是为了给即将举行的“大选”作准备，利用刺刀和枪杆向老挝人民进行威胁，迫使老挝人民给他们的人投票。但是，其目的不只是这一点。
    评论说，美国太平洋陆军部队总司令怀特在吴庭艳军队的军官陪同下，最近视察了下寮，并同老挝国防大臣富米·诺萨万和“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们进行了密谈。随后，吴庭艳军队和老挝王国军队就在老越边境进行了互相配合的“扫荡”。在美帝国主义的指使下，老挝极端反动的集团进一步同吴庭艳集团进行勾结，这种作法是非常危险的。这将使老挝同南越一样变成美国的战争基地，被利用来威胁印度支那爱好和平的国家，破坏东南亚的和平和民族解放运动。
