Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The person in charge of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense issued a statement today, strongly condemning the US government's persecution of American black leader Winston.

The person in charge said: "Recently, the US authorities brutally persecuted Henry Winston, the leader of American blacks and an outstanding peace fighter. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense expresses its strongest condemnation of this barbaric act by the US ruling group. We know that Henry Winston has been waging arduous struggles for peace, democracy, and against the US ruling group's war and aggression policies, and the US ruling group is therefore carrying out extremely cruel persecution against him. It is very clear that the US reactionary forces are attempting to suppress the increasingly high tide of the American people's struggle for peace and democracy and to save their precarious reactionary rule by such barbaric means. Their reactionary and barbaric measures are enough to further expose the hideous features of the US ruling group and have therefore been condemned by peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world."

The person in charge said: "The US ruling group not only persecutes its own people internally but also consistently implements war and aggression policies externally, endangering world peace. Winston's just struggle and that of thousands of American people against the policies of US imperialism is by no means isolated, and people all over the world are supporting them."

The person in charge finally said: "The Chinese people express deep sympathy and support for Winston and other persecuted American peace and progressive figures, as well as for the thousands of American people who are waging unyielding struggles for peace and democracy. We firmly believe that the forces of world peace will inevitably defeat the forces of war, and that in today's world, where the forces of peace and socialism far outweigh the forces of war and reaction, final victory will surely belong to the united and struggling American people."

    不许迫害温斯顿
  我和大负责人谴责美国当局的暴行
    新华社11日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天发表谈话，强烈谴责美国政府迫害美国黑人领袖温斯顿。
    负责人说：“最近美国当局残暴地迫害美国黑人的领袖、杰出的和平战士亨利·温斯顿。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会对美国统治集团这一野蛮暴行表示最强烈的谴责。我们知道，亨利·温斯顿一直为争取和平、民主和反对美国统治集团的战争和侵略政策进行了坚苦卓绝的斗争，美国统治集团因此对他进行极为残酷的迫害。很显然，美国反动势力企图以这种野蛮的手段，来压制美国人民日益高涨的争取和平、民主的斗争，挽救其垂危的反动统治。它们这种反动的、野蛮的措施，适足以进一步暴露美国统治集团的狰狞面目，因此受到了全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的谴责。”
    负责人说：“美国统治集团不仅对内迫害本国人民，而且对外一贯执行战争和侵略政策，危害世界和平。温斯顿和千千万万美国人民为反对美帝国主义的政策的正义斗争决不是孤立的，全世界人民都在支持他们。”
    这位负责人最后说：“中国人民对温斯顿和其他受迫害的美国和平进步人士，以及千千万万为和平与民主而进行不屈不挠的斗争的美国人民表示深切的同情与支持。我们坚信，世界和平力量必然战胜战争力量，在和平与社会主义力量已大大超过战争与反动势力的今天，最后胜利一定属于团结一致、坚持斗争的美国人民。
