    Taking the "Hot Air" Route
    Jing Yu
    After reading the news of the successful and creative adoption of hot air blowing in converters by steelworkers in Qingdao, one cannot help but sincerely praise: Bravo, this wind! A major innovation in China's steelmaking technology.
    Converter steelmaking previously used cold air blowing. With cold air, the temperature of the molten steel was insufficient, so ferrosilicon alloy was added to increase it.
  This not only took a long time and was costly, but also limited the quality and variety of steel. Now, with the experience of hot air blowing, the temperature of molten steel can generally be increased from 1460 degrees to 1600 degrees. The converter utilization coefficient increases from 27 tons with cold air blowing to 34 tons. The quality of steel and the first-class product rate increases from 60% to over 80%, and in some cases reaches about 95%. This not only shortens the smelting time, increases steel production, and reduces pig iron consumption, but also brings converter steelmaking into a new field, where it will compete with electric furnaces and open-hearth furnaces to see which is better.
    In foreign countries, many countries raise the temperature of molten steel by using oxygen side blowing or oxygen-enriched top blowing methods. Is oxygen steelmaking good? Of course, it is good. However, oxygen production is not as simple as hot air blowing; it requires specialized oxygen production equipment. Under China's current circumstances, with converter equipment spread throughout the country, it would be difficult to use oxygen for blowing everywhere. The "hot air" experience in Qingdao, however, opens up a broad path for high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost converter steel this year.
    Turning cold air into hot air requires advanced thinking and revolutionary ambition. Comrade Mao Zedong's call to break down superstitions and liberate thought has brought people's subjective initiative into full play. People have eliminated metaphysical viewpoints in their thinking, broken down superstitions in industrial technology, and broken down superstitions in smelting technology. As a result, multi-tap steelmaking has emerged, multi-strand rolling has emerged, mixed steelmaking has emerged, and converter steelmaking without baking furnaces has emerged. Now, the new experience of hot air blowing in converter production has emerged. All of these have not only greatly promoted the development of productive forces but also have a far-reaching impact on the continuous leap forward in the 1960s.
    Here, it is worth mentioning that many valuable advanced experiences and creations in the metallurgical industry often come from "small modern groups" enterprises that are not valued by people. High-temperature blast in ironmaking is one example, and hot air blowing in converters is another. National "small modern groups" enterprises are learning from advanced "small modern groups" units, and some "large modern groups" enterprises are also preparing to learn the advanced experience of "small modern groups" enterprises.
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided that hot air blowing should be universally promoted in medium-sized and small converters, as well as in large converters, and all should follow the "hot air" route. We must promote the spirit of bold innovation and the spirit of humble learning, so that the revolutionary hot air of Qingdao can spread throughout the country and exert greater power.

    走“热风”路线
    静宇
    看了青岛的炼钢工人创造性地采用转炉热风吹炼的成功消息，不禁使人由衷地发出赞颂：快哉，此风！我国炼钢技术上的一项重大革新。
    转炉炼钢，以往都是用冷风吹炼；用冷风，钢水的温度不够，就靠增加矽铁合金来提高。
  这样，不仅时间长，成本大，而且钢的质量和品种都受到一定的限制。现在，有了热风吹炼的经验，钢水温度，一般能从一千四百六十度提高到一千六百度，转炉利用系数，由冷风吹炼时的二十七吨，提高到三十四吨，钢的质量和一级品率由60％提高到80％以上，有的达到95％左右。这样，不仅缩短了冶炼时间，提高了钢的产量，降低了生铁消耗，而且使转炉炼钢进入了一个新的领域，将和电炉、平炉较量一番，比比高低。
    在国外，许多国家提高钢水温度是采用氧气侧吹或富氧顶吹的办法来实现的，氧气炼钢好不好？当然好。可是制氧并不像热风吹炼那样简单，需要有专门的制氧设备。在我国目前的情况下，转炉设备遍布全国，处处都用氧气去吹炼，当然很难办到。而青岛的“热风”经验，恰恰就为今年的转炉钢的高产优质低成本开辟了一条广阔的途径。
    把冷风变作热风，没有先进的思想，没有革命的雄心，是办不到的。毛泽东同志提出的破除迷信，解放思想，使人的主观能动性得到了空前的发挥。人们在思想上破除了形而上学的观点，打破了工业技术上的迷信，打破了冶炼技术上的迷信。从而多槽出钢出现了，多条轧钢出现了，混合炼钢出现了，转炉不烘炉炼钢出现了，现在，转炉生产上热风吹炼的新经验又出现了。所有这些，不但对于生产力的发展起了巨大的推动作用，而且对于六十年代的连续跃进有着深远的影响。
    这里，值得特别提起的，冶金工业中许多可贵的先进经验和创造，往往来自不被人们看得起的“小洋群”企业，炼铁方面的高温大风是如此，转炉方面的热风吹炼又是如此。全国“小洋群”企业正在向先进的“小洋群”单位学习，有些“大洋群”企业也正在准备学习“小洋群”企业的先进经验。
    冶金工业部决定，热风吹炼要在中、小转炉普遍推广，也要在大型转炉中普遍推广，都要走“热风”路线。我们要发扬大胆革新的风气，发扬虚心学习的风气，让青岛的革命热风吹遍全国，发出更大的威力。
