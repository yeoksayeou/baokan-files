Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 4th. This reporter reports: In the German Democratic Republic, more than 10,000 housewives have gradually participated in socialist production and national construction through the form of "Housewives Labor Teams" in the past year or so. Currently, more than three thousand seven hundred "Housewives Labor Teams" have been developed.

The "Housewives Labor Teams" were first initiated in rural areas. In order to meet the needs of the busy farming season, some rural women temporarily organized to help agricultural production cooperatives with sowing, harvesting and other tasks. This organizational form received the attention and support of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and was subsequently promoted in cities as well, developing into a year-round organization.

The "Housewives Labor Teams" are organized at the grassroots level based on residential areas. The Socialist Unity Party members among the housewives are the core of this organization. After the establishment of the labor teams, they generally establish contact with local factories or production cooperatives, helping them with work and partially solving the needs of production units for labor. The fifty-two housewives from the Stalin Avenue in Berlin Democratic District who participated in the "Housewives Labor Team" participated in more than one thousand and thirty hours of productive labor in February alone. Nearly twenty housewives from the binding workshop of the Berlin Printing Factory helped with the binding work, enabling this printing factory to complete the publication of a magazine on time. Some members of the "Housewives Labor Teams" participate in the sales work of state-owned stores or consumer cooperatives, or other service industries.

During this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, some members of the "Housewives Labor Teams" will be commended or rewarded by factories or women's organizations for their outstanding work achievements.

The increasing enthusiasm of housewives to participate in national construction is inseparable from the party's propaganda and education work. Eliminating the remnants of bourgeois ideology that despises women's participation in social productive labor and encouraging women to engage in various national construction activities – this is a major task that the party, government and women's organizations of the German Democratic Republic regularly carry out in the women's movement. After years of propaganda and education, the social perception of women's participation in productive labor has changed, and the consciousness of housewives has also been greatly improved. The members of the "Housewives Labor Teams" feel honored and proud to participate in productive labor and contribute to the realization of the Seven-Year Plan. After participating in social productive labor, many housewives not only work actively, but also study technology diligently and participate in various study discussions. After participating in social productive labor, many housewives consciously donate part of their remuneration to national construction or social welfare undertakings. In order to enable housewives to gradually become fixed producers through the "Housewives Labor Teams", the party, the government and women's organizations plan to absorb them into long-term work in some production units that need labor.

    鼓励妇女从事生产劳动　肃清轻视妇女的观点
    德家庭妇女组织起来参加建设
    城乡“家庭妇女劳动队”已发展到三千七百多个
    新华社柏林4日电　本社记者报道：德意志民主共和国的一万多名家庭妇女，在过去一年多的时间内，通过“家庭妇女劳动队”的形式，逐步参加社会主义生产和国家建设。现在，“家庭妇女劳动队”已发展到三千七百多个。
    “家庭妇女劳动队”首先是从农村中发起的。为了适应农忙季节的需要，一些农村妇女临时组织起来，帮助农业生产合作社进行播种、收割等工作。这种组织形式受到德国统一社会党中央委员会的重视和支持，随后也在城市中推广，并且发展成为常年性的组织。
    “家庭妇女劳动队”是以居住地区为基层而组织起来的。家庭妇女中的统一社会党党员是这一组织的核心。劳动队成立后，一般都和当地的工厂或生产合作社取得联系，帮助它们工作，部分地解决了生产单位对于劳动力的需要。柏林民主区斯大林大街参加“家庭妇女劳动队”的五十二位家庭妇女，仅在今年2月就参加了一千零三十多小时的生产劳动。柏林印刷厂装订车间近二十个家庭妇女帮助装订工作，使得这家印刷厂能按时完成一种杂志的出版任务。有些“家庭妇女劳动队”的队员参加国营商店或消费合作社的售货工作或其他服务性行业的工作。
    在今年“三八”国际妇女节的时候，将有一些“家庭妇女劳动队”的成员由于工作成绩显著而获得工厂或妇女组织的表扬或奖励。
    家庭妇女参加国家建设的积极性日益提高，是与党的宣传教育工作分不开的。肃清轻视妇女参加社会生产劳动的资产阶级思想残余和鼓励妇女从事各项国家建设——这是德意志民主共和国党和政府以及妇女组织在妇女运动中经常进行的一件重大工作。经过多年的宣传教育，改变了社会上对妇女参加生产劳动的看法，也大大提高了家庭妇女的觉悟。参加“家庭妇女劳动队”的成员都对参加生产劳动、能为实现七年计划贡献自己的力量而感到光荣和自豪。许多家庭妇女参加社会生产劳动以后，不仅积极工作，而且还认真学习技术和参加各种学习讨论。不少家庭妇女在参加社会生产劳动后，把自己得到的一部分报酬自觉地捐献给国家建设事业或社会福利事业。为使家庭妇女能够通过“家庭妇女劳动队”逐渐成为固定的生产者，党、政府和妇女组织有计划地在一些需要劳动力的生产单位吸收她们长期参加工作。
