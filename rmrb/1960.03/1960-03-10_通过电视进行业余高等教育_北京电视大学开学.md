Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Beijing Television University officially opened on the 8th. At 13:00, a blackboard was hung in the Beijing Television Station broadcasting room, and Xu Meili, a teacher from Beijing Normal University, began lecturing on the first lesson of Advanced Chemistry, just like she would on a school podium.

Beijing Television University is an amateur university founded jointly by the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau and the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau of Beijing Television under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The method of study is mainly correspondence self-study, supplemented by television lectures, and assisted by the students' work units in organizing students' studies.

The university has undergraduate and preparatory courses, and has enrolled more than 6,000 students. Undergraduate students are mostly employed personnel from factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, military units, organizations, and schools who have a high school education or equivalent qualifications. Preparatory course students must undergo a period of review before being promoted to undergraduate studies. The undergraduate program currently has three departments: Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The teaching of each department is basically a single-subject progression, with eight hours of study per week, including four hours of self-study and four hours of class time in front of the television. Classes are divided into two sessions, two periods each time, and each class is replayed once the next day. During the teaching process, relevant scientific education films are also shown, and tutoring and tests are organized to further enrich the teaching content. At the same time, according to the needs of the course, students are organized to conduct experiments and complete assignments.

The teachers of each department of this university are assisted by Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Normal College. These three institutions have sent professors with experience in running schools and administrative leaders to serve as directors of each department. The part-time teachers sent by the three institutions are determined to teach the courses of the Television University well, and have been enthusiastically preparing lessons and compiling teaching materials for a long time.

During the preparation period, this school conducted four television teaching trial broadcasts, and organized factories, mines, enterprises, and schools to receive broadcasts with emphasis, and the situation was good.

    通过电视进行业余高等教育
    北京电视大学开学
    据新华社8日讯　北京电视大学8日正式开学。十三点北京电视台播送室里挂上了黑板，北京师范大学的教师徐美丽像在学校讲台上一样，开始了高等化学第一课的讲授。
    北京电视大学是在中共北京市委领导下，由北京市教育局和广播事业局北京电视台共同创办的业余性质的大学。学习方式以函授自学为主，电视讲授为辅，并由学员所在单位协助组织学员学习。
    全校设本科和预科，现已招生六千多名。本科学生大都是具有高中文化程度和同等学力的厂矿、企业、机关、部队、团体和学校的在职人员。预科的学员，须经过一段复习才升入本科。本科现在设数学、物理、化学三系。各系科的教学基本上是单科独进，每周学习八小时，其中四小时自学，四小时在电视机旁上课。上课分两次，每次上二节，每次课都在次日重播一次。教学过程中，还放映有关科学教育影片，组织辅导、测验，进一步丰富教学内容。同时根据课程需要，组织学员实验，完成作业。
    这个大学各系科的教师，都是北京大学、北京师范大学和北京师范学院协助解决的。这三个院校派出办学有经验的教授和行政领导干部分别兼任各系科的主任。三个院校派来的兼职教师都决心要把电视大学的课教好，很早就热情地备课，编写了教材。
    这个学校在筹备期间曾进行过四次电视教学试播，有重点地组织了厂矿、企业和学校收播，情况良好。
