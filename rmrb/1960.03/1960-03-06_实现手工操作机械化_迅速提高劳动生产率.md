    Achieving Mechanization of Manual Operations
    Rapidly Increasing Labor Productivity
    Soviet Vegetable Gardens: Machines Transplant Seedlings
    Efficiency Increased a Hundredfold: Vegetable Farmers are Delighted
    More than half of vegetables require seedling transplantation. The labor of transplanting seedlings is very heavy and inefficient. Seedlings must be planted one by one, with tens of thousands of plants per hectare! For example, late cabbage requires 16,000 plants per hectare, and tomatoes require 32,000 to 48,000 plants. In addition, each hectare of land requires ten to twenty-five tons of water! Therefore, each hectare of land requires twenty to thirty transplanting workers, who must work bent over all day.
    Now, transplanting machines are working in Soviet vegetable gardens. The following picture shows the "SRNOM-4" suspended transplanter; it opens furrows in the ground while planting seedlings. The two large boxes at the rear of the machine are used to hold water or liquid fertilizer. Immediately after a seedling is planted, the machine waters it, sprinkles a layer of soil, and compacts the soil. The "SRNOM-4" can plant seedlings in square rows and can also plant seedlings in nutrient pots and in ordinary soil, as well as plant vernalized or non-vernalized potatoes. Even better, when planting in a square pattern, there is no need to measure with steel wire; workers can plant a new row using a row marker according to the previous row spacing. The "SRNOM-4" transplanter can plant 4.2 hectares of seedlings per day. This machine is a hundred times more efficient than manual labor, delighting vegetable garden workers.
        Machine Packages Salt: Simple and Convenient
        Three People per Machine: Replacing Dozens
    This is an ordinary loader, with a bucket conveyor in the front for taking granular goods, and a cargo box with two funnels next to it. Each funnel is equipped with two doors, one door opens automatically when the other door closes. The funnels can hold fifty kilograms of salt.
    This simple and easy-to-operate salt packaging machine, designed and manufactured by Soviet experts and workers, has almost completely mechanized the salt packaging process.
    Three people working on this machine can package 160 tons of salt per shift. If this much salt were to be packaged manually, it would require a team of dozens of loaders and unloaders.
        New Washing Machine: Lightweight and Cheap
        Washes Two Kilograms in Less Than Five Minutes
    The design office of the Riga Electric Factory in the Soviet Union recently designed a new washing machine called the "Riga-60." Many metal parts in the new washing machine have been replaced with plastic. This will greatly reduce the machine's total weight and production costs. The new washing machine can wash up to two kilograms of underwear in just five minutes. (Picture Attached)

### 实现手工操作机械化  迅速提高劳动生产率

    实现手工操作机械化
    迅速提高劳动生产率
    苏联菜园里　机器栽秧苗
    工效高百倍　菜农皆欢喜
    蔬菜里，有一半以上要栽秧苗。栽秧苗的劳动非常繁重，效率很低。秧苗要一株一株地栽，每一公顷都要栽上万株！例如晚白菜每公顷要栽一万六千株，西红柿要栽三万二千到四万八千株。此外，每公顷地还要浇十吨到二十五吨水！因此，每一公顷地就需用二三十个栽苗工，而且他们得整天弯着腰劳动。
    现在栽植机已经在苏联的菜园里工作了。下图就是“斯尔诺姆—4”悬挂式栽植机；它在地里一面开沟，一面把秧苗栽到地里。机器后部的两个大箱子是用来装水或液体肥料的。秧苗一栽好机器就浇上一些水，撒上一层土并且把土压紧。“斯尔诺姆—4”能把秧苗栽成方形小行，还可以在营养钵内和一般的地里栽植秧苗，以及栽已经春化处理的或未经春化处理的土豆。更妙的是在方形栽植时，不需要用钢丝绳测量，工人只要用划行器按照上一次的行距，就可栽植新的一行。“斯尔诺姆—4”栽植机一天可以栽秧苗四点二公顷。这种机器效率比用人工提高百倍，使菜园劳动者皆大欢喜。
        机器包食盐　简单又灵便
        三人一台机　代替几十人
    这是一台普通装货机，前面装有带斗的输送装置，斗是用来取散粒状货物的，旁边是一个带两个漏斗的货箱。每个漏斗装有两个门，一个门打开的时候，另一个门就自动关上。漏斗可装五十公斤盐。
    苏联专家和工人设计、制造的这台简单而操作灵便的食盐打包机差不多使盐的打包工作完全机械化了。
    三个人在这台机器上一班可以打包一百六十吨盐。如果用手工来打包这么多盐，那就需要一个几十个装卸工人的工作队。
        新式洗衣机　轻便又便宜
        不到五分钟　洗衣两公斤
    苏联里加电机厂设计室最近设计了一种新洗衣机，这种洗衣机叫做“里加—60”。新洗衣机上许多金属零件都改用塑料。这将大大减轻机器的总重量和生产成本。新洗衣机洗涤两公斤内衣最多只要五分钟。（附图片）
