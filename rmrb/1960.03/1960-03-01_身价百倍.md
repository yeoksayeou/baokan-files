Value Multiplied a Hundredfold
Su Yi

The pig is the head of the six domestic animals, and all regions are raising them in a big way, which is naturally very necessary. We should also enable cattle, donkeys, horses, and mules to have great development. And fully developing their comprehensive utilization and greatly raising their value is a very important measure to promote the rapid development of large livestock.

The experience of Guangfeng County, Jiangxi, in the comprehensive utilization of oxen, published in this newspaper today, is a very convincing example. In 1959, in addition to using oxen for breeding and plowing fields, the county also widely used oxen power to pull carts and build water conservancy projects. As a result, the county saved 1.59 million workdays, accounting for 7% of the total labor force. In addition, cows were used for milking, producing more than 100,000 jin of fresh milk, with an average daily output of about 800 jin. Once comprehensively utilized, the oxen in this county became a hundred times more valuable, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for raising cattle. Of course, the prominent significance of this advanced experience lies not only in increasing the value of oxen but also, more importantly, in solving the contradiction between the cost of feeding and the use value in livestock production, which is a relatively common problem. At present, the cost of feeding livestock is generally high, while the use value is low, which affects the enthusiasm of various regions to develop livestock. If all regions can universally promote the comprehensive utilization of large livestock like Guangfeng County, Jiangxi, the use value of livestock will naturally be greatly improved.

The use value of many objects is originally objective, but it can indeed develop and change with certain conditions of the times. The key here lies in people's deeper understanding of the object and their ability to master and use it. Before Karamay was developed, the oil there existed for many years, but the local people could not use it. More than fifty years ago, aluminum was very scarce and was regarded as a very precious metal. After people mined it in large quantities, it is now made into common household utensils. In many areas in the south, oxen have always been used only for plowing fields, and are only used for three months of the year, being idle for nine months. The value they create is inevitably relatively low. Now, one ox is used for multiple purposes: plowing fields, transporting goods, and milking. They benefit people all year round, and their use value is several times higher than before. People naturally attach more importance to them and are willing to develop them faster and more, and the cost of feeding will naturally decrease accordingly. Coupled with attention to improving management systems and continuously improving the level of feeding management, the cost will be greatly reduced. With this two-pronged approach, on the one hand, increasing the use value of livestock, and on the other hand, reducing the cost of feeding, developing livestock becomes more economically viable, and the enthusiasm of all parties will be even higher. Everyone will try every means to raise and specially raise large livestock, so that China's large livestock will develop faster.

    身价百倍

    猪为六畜之首，各地都在大养特养，这自然十分必要。对于牛、驴、马、骡，我们也应该使它们有一个大发展。而充分发展它们的综合利用，大大抬高它们的身价，是促进大牲畜迅速发展的一个很重要的措施。
    本报今天发表的江西广丰县综合利用耕牛的经验是一个很有说服力的例子。1959年，这个县除了把耕牛用于繁殖、耕田之外，还广泛利用牛力拉车、兴修水利。全县由此节省劳动日一百五十九万个，占总劳力7％。此外，又用母牛挤奶，已产鲜奶十多万斤，平均日产达八百斤左右。这个县的耕牛一经综合利用，一时变得身价百倍，大大提高了干部和群众养牛的积极性。当然，这一先进经验的突出意义，不仅仅在于为耕牛提高了身价，更重要的是在实践中解决了当前牲畜业生产中一个比较普遍的饲养成本和使用价值的矛盾问题。目前一般牲畜的饲养成本偏高，而使用价值则偏低，因而影响着各地发展牲畜的积极性。如果各地都能够像江西广丰县那样，普遍推行大牲畜的综合利用，自然就会大大提高牲畜的使用价值。
    许多物体的使用价值本来是客观存在，但又确能随着一定的时代条件发展和变化。这里的关键在于人们对该物体加深认识，并且能够掌握和使用它。克拉玛依没有开发以前，那里的石油存在了许多年，当地人民不能加以使用。五十多年以前铝很稀少，被当作极贵重的金属，当人们大量开采以后，现在制成家常的器皿使用。南方许多地区，耕牛一向只用作耕田，一年之中只使用三个月，空闲九个月，它所创造的价值必然相对的低。现在一牛多用，既耕田，又运输，又挤奶，一年四季造福于人，它的使用价值比以前增加了好几倍。人们自然更加重视它，愿意更快更多地发展它，饲养成本当然也就随着降低了。再加上注意改进经营管理制度，不断提高饲养管理水平，成本还会大大降低。这样双管齐下，一面提高牲畜的使用价值，一面降低饲养成本，发展牲畜在经济上愈加合算，各方面的积极性就会更加高涨，大家就愈加要千方百计、大养而特养大牲畜，使我国的大牲畜更快地发展起来。
