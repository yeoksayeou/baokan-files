Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 1st: "Izvestia" published an article today pointing out that West Germany is secretly colluding with Spain to establish West German military warehouses and military bases on Spanish territory, and that the United States, Britain, and France knew about this in advance. The governments of these three countries have no reason to feign surprise and pretend that they have nothing to do with the secret collusion between Bonn and Madrid.

The article stated that a representative of the U.S. State Department had said that he knew about the "informal discussions" between West Germany and Spain regarding the establishment of "exercise" bases in Spain, and believed that this was "necessary" for West Germany. The article also pointed out that West Germany and Spain had already begun discussing plans for West Germany to establish military bases in Spain at the end of last year. At that time, during talks between Western countries, West Germany raised the idea of ​​obtaining bases in Spain. The article said that obviously, Bonn took action after obtaining the tacit consent of other Western partners. The article then pointed out that Adenauer and Franco's collusion is a brazen challenge to the people. The secret collusion between the two most reactionary countries in Europe is reminiscent of the "Berlin-Madrid" axis of Hitler and Spain in those years, and also reminds people of the "general exercises" that Hitler once conducted on Spanish territory before World War II.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: TASS, New York, reported: The "New York Times" reported on February 29th that the plan for West Germany to establish bases in Spain was not only notified to the U.S. side in advance, but was actually approved by them. The newspaper's Madrid correspondent Wells wrote that "senior officials of the Washington State Department and American diplomats in Madrid already knew about the proposals that West Germany had made to Spain when President Eisenhower visited Franco in Madrid on December 21."

The reporter quoted "authoritative sources" in the Spanish capital as saying that Spanish representatives reportedly put forward preconditions during negotiations with Bonn: "Before the negotiations, West Germany must first notify the United States, Britain, and France and obtain their consent." The reporter also said: "West German Foreign Minister Brentano (later) accepted these conditions during his talks with Castiella. This meeting was held in Brentano's office in Bonn on November 11 (last year)."

The "New York Times" correspondent in Paris, Sulzberger, also pointed out that the United States "has known about Strauss's secret for several weeks."

    苏联“消息报”发表文章指出
    美国支持西德在国外建立军事基地
    美国报纸承认艾森豪威尔事先知道波恩和马德里的勾结
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　“消息报”今天发表文章指出，西德正在和西班牙秘密勾结以便在西班牙领土上建立西德军事仓库和军事基地，这件事美、英、法三国是事先知道的。这三国的政府没有任何根据假装惊奇，装作它们似乎同波恩—马德里的秘密勾结没有什么关系。
    文章说，美国国务院的代表曾说过，他知道西德和西班牙“非正式讨论”西德在西班牙建立“演习”基地的事，并认为这对西德“是必需的”。文章还指出，去年年底，西德和西班牙就已开始讨论西德在西班牙建立军事基地的计划。当时，在西方国家会谈期间，西德就提出了要在西班牙获得基地的意见。文章说，显然，在得到其他西方伙伴的默许后，波恩才行动起来。文章接着指出，阿登纳和佛朗哥的勾结是对人民的无耻挑战。欧洲两个最反动的国家之间的秘密勾结，使人想起了当年希特勒和西班牙的“柏林—马德里”轴心，同时也使人想起了第二次世界大战前希特勒曾经在西班牙领土上进行的“总演习”。
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：“纽约时报”2月29日的报道指出，关于西德想在西班牙建立基地的计划，不仅事前通知了美国方面，而且实际上得到了他们的赞同。这家报纸驻马德里记者韦尔斯写道，“华盛顿国务院高级官员和美国驻马德里的外交官员，在艾森豪威尔总统12月21日在马德里拜会佛朗哥时，就已经知道西德向西班牙提出的建议。”
    记者援引西班牙首都“权威人士”的话指出，西班牙代表同波恩谈判时据说提出了先决条件，“要西德在谈判之前，先通知美国、英国、法国并得到它们的同意”。记者还说：“西德外交部长勃伦塔诺
  （后来）在同卡斯铁利亚会谈时接受了这些条件。这次会谈是在（去年）11月11日在波恩勃伦塔诺的办公室里举行的。”
    “纽约时报”驻巴黎记者苏兹贝格也指出，美国“知道施特劳斯的秘密已经好几个星期了”。
