    The Movie Studio That Started From Scratch
    The Baicheng Changling County News Film Studio was built in September 1958 under the direct leadership of the Changling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past year or so, it has produced eight short documentaries, which have been deeply loved by the masses.
    It was in September 1958 that Fang Jingsheng, a technician at the county broadcasting station, boldly proposed to make local films and run his own film studio under the inspiration of the Great Leap Forward. The county party committee, knowing this, supported his daring approach. First, they sent him to "Changying" (Changchun Film Studio) to study. After a few days of study, he bought a small camera and some medicine and film from the Beijing News Film Studio, and began filming. Without a developing room, they borrowed an office to use as a substitute; without blackout curtains, they borrowed curtains from the cinema; without a drying room, they simply dried the film outside. In this way, after thirteen days, the film studio, which had spent less than 500 yuan, produced its first news documentary - "Celebrating the Realization of People's Communes Throughout the County." Afterwards, they produced several more films, especially the two 35mm features, "The Commune's Flowers are Blooming, and the Granaries are Full" and "A Good Start," which were enthusiastically welcomed by audiences. "The Commune's Flowers are Blooming, and the Granaries are Full" was also shown in various counties in the Baicheng area and received good reviews.

    白手起家的制片厂
    白城长岭县新闻电影制片厂，是在中共长岭县委的直接领导下，1958年9月建起来的。一年多来，共拍制了小型纪录片八部，深受广大群众的喜爱。
    那是在1958年9月间，县广播站机务员方景生在大跃进鼓舞下，大胆地提出了要搞土电影、自办电影制片厂，县委知道了，就支持了他这种敢想敢干的作法。首先派他到“长影”进行学习。经过几天的学习，又在北京新闻电影制片厂买一台小型摄影机，买一些药和一些胶片，就开始拍摄电影的工作了。没有洗片室，就借一间办公室代替；没有遮光布，就借电影院窗帘代用；没有烘干室，就在外边晒。就是这样，经过十三天的时间，没花上五百元钱的电影制片厂拍出了第一部新闻纪录片——“庆祝全县实现人民公社化”。接着又拍制了几部片子，其中特别是“公社花开金满仓”和“开门红”两部三寸五毫米的大片子，受到观众热烈欢迎。“公社花开金满仓”还在白城地区各县上映，博得好评。
