Accelerating Agricultural Technological Transformation is the Glorious Task of the Industrial Front
Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have instructed us: we must strengthen industrial support for agriculture and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture. The broad masses of workers and staff in Jiangxi Province have shown the greatest enthusiasm for the instructions of the Party Central Committee. They regard supporting agriculture and realizing the technological transformation of agriculture as their unshirkable and glorious political task. At present, all regions and relevant enterprises are vigorously launching a mass movement of industry supporting agriculture. In the movement, the broad masses of workers and staff, full of energy and confidence, are demanding to complete 100,000 Jiangxi 59-type rice transplanters, 40 or more tractors, 26,200 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, 154,000 semi-mechanized farm tools, 750,000 improved farm tools, and 890,000 small farm tools before the spring plowing production, in order to support the great leap forward of agricultural production this year.

Most of the workers and staff are clear about the great political significance of industrial support for agriculture and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture, and have made very good achievements in their actual work. However, not everyone has a very clear understanding, and there are still some comrades whose thinking is relatively vague. To establish the firm idea of ​​industrial support for agriculture in everyone, especially industrial cadres, a lot of political and ideological work is still needed.

Some comrades believe that the conditions for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture are not yet mature, and it should be done slowly. Are the conditions not mature? No, it is that these comrades' thinking lags behind the reality of socialist construction. They cannot see that after the construction of the first five-year plan and the continuous great leap forwards of 1958 and 1959, Jiangxi Province has achieved great development in industry, and industries such as iron and steel and machinery have already had a certain foundation. At the same time, it should also be seen that in the past few years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of new technical forces have been cultivated. This has prepared the material conditions for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture.

The establishment of the People's Commune has created extremely favorable social conditions for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture and realizing agricultural modernization. This new production relation and new social organization form of the People's Commune can most rapidly promote the development of social productive forces and open up a broad path for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture. Everyone sees that because the People's Commune can most reasonably arrange manpower and most fully utilize natural resources to realize continuous leap forward in production, its accumulation has rapidly increased, and many communes have already accumulated a considerable amount of funds and are eagerly demanding to purchase various agricultural machines.

It can be seen that both the material and social conditions for accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture are available. The key to the problem lies in: should we "slowly come"? Or should we go all out, give full play to people's subjective initiative, and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture? Our answer is the latter rather than the former. Only in this way can we meet the needs of agricultural technological transformation and vigorously support farmers; only in this way can we rapidly transfer agriculture from backward manual labor to large-scale machine production, and greatly increase agricultural labor productivity and the commodity rate of agricultural products; only in this way can we further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis and promote socialist industrialization. Of course, on the road of leaping forward, due to the acceleration of speed and the increase of tasks, some new problems and new difficulties will naturally arise, such as the contradiction between the increase of various tasks and labor force, and the contradiction between production and the supply of certain raw materials, materials and technologies. These difficulties are not dominant. The dominant factors are the favorable conditions we mentioned above. Our difficulties in advancing can be completely solved under the leadership of the Party, by fully mobilizing the masses, launching mass movements, and engaging in large-scale cooperation. The idea of ​​"slowly come" is obviously not in line with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong to vigorously support agriculture and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture. It also violates the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Secondly, some industrial cadres only know that industry is important, but do not understand that agriculture is equally important. This idea is one-sided and wrong. It should be affirmed that socialist industry is the dominant factor in the entire national economy. Without the priority development of heavy industry and socialist industrialization, there is no point in talking about agricultural modernization. But it is also necessary to understand that agriculture is the foundation of the entire national economy. Socialist industrial construction must first rely on agriculture. China's socialist construction practice has proven that the second year of agricultural bumper harvest has brought about a great leap forward in industry. The abundance of agriculture determines the speed of development of industry and the entire national economy. Because, to develop industry, first of all, people need to eat and have food, secondly, raw materials, thirdly, market, and fourthly, labor force. These items come entirely or mainly from agriculture. Agricultural backwardness will inevitably affect the development of industry. This is an obvious truth.

The Party's general line of socialist construction and the complete set of "walking on two legs" policies it includes, include: under the condition of priority development of heavy industry, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry. Adopting this policy enables us to avoid the one-sidedness of only valuing industry and neglecting agriculture, and only valuing heavy industry and neglecting light industry in the leap forward of economic construction. This policy correctly reflects the requirements of the objective law of the proportional relationship between the two major categories under the conditions of the priority growth of the production of the means of production. Years of experience have proven that: both letting go of developing industry and letting go of developing agriculture; on the one hand, engaging in industrial construction, and on the other hand, improving people's lives (improving life mainly relies on agriculture, the most important living materials in people's lives come from agriculture, and most of the raw materials for light industry also come from agriculture), walking on two legs of production and life can enable China's national economy to develop both at a high speed and proportionally. All of this is an extremely important development in the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism, which political economy will write about in great detail in the future.

Third, some industrial cadres do not have a deep understanding of the relationship between socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization. They do not know that without industrialization, it is impossible to promote agricultural modernization, and without agricultural modernization, it is impossible to complete socialist industrialization. It is impossible to imagine that socialism can be established for a long time on the basis of advanced technology industry on the one hand and backward technology agriculture on the other. If this is the case, industry and agriculture cannot develop in a coordinated manner, socialist industrialization will encounter great difficulties, and it will not be possible to fully realize socialist industrialization. Only by gradually establishing industry and agriculture on the basis of modern large-scale production can industry and agriculture develop at a coordinated and high speed, and can we build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "In terms of technological revolution, the main task is: to transfer the national economy, including agriculture and handicrafts, to a new technological basis, to the technological basis of modern large-scale production in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that all labor that can use machines will use machines, and realize the electrification of all cities and rural areas in the country;..." It can be seen that the view of separating socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization is untenable.

Fourth, some cadres also say that industrial support for agriculture will affect the development of industry. This view is also one-sided. Industrial support for agriculture also develops industry. Agricultural machinery, power stations, and fertilizer plants are all industries! Developing industry and supporting agricultural technological transformation are not contradictory. On the contrary, it can greatly promote the development of industry. I think this is a very obvious and easy-to-understand principle, and there is no need to explain it further.

Based on the specific situation in Jiangxi Province, to realize agricultural mechanization, farmland irrigation, and rural electrification, it roughly requires 75,000 to 80,000 tractors and corresponding agricultural machinery such as sowing, transplanting, harvesting, and threshing, 250,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment, and about 4.5 million kilowatts of power generation. To realize this great task, in terms of steps, some can be done earlier, such as irrigation, some require a longer period of effort, such as mechanization; and some require even longer, such as electrification. But we cannot wait, we must actively struggle to gradually realize this magnificent goal. At present, we must also vigorously carry out technological reforms, promote improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools, and transform existing old farm tools. In 1960, our initial arrangements are: to increase 500 standard tractors and 1,900 corresponding machine-pulled farm tools, increase 600 sets of electric rope traction machines, increase 45,000 horsepower of mechanical irrigation and drainage equipment, increase 10,000 kilowatts of rural power generation installed capacity, and increase 180,000 to 190,000 tons of chemical fertilizers. At the same time, we must also actively promote semi-mechanized farm tools and improved farm tools, and plan to add 2,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 150,000 Jiangxi 59-type rice transplanters, 100,000 potato chip slicing machines, 17,000 other processing machines, 360,000 hand-pushed rubber-wheeled carts, and 45,000 sets of animal-powered rubber-wheeled carts. All agricultural machinery enterprises in the province must strive to complete and over fulfill the production and repair tasks stipulated by the state. The products manufactured and repaired must "guarantee use, guarantee teaching, and guarantee repair". We must resolutely overcome the erroneous thinking of so-called three willingness and three unwillingness (willing to manufacture but unwilling to repair, willing to be fixed but unwilling to be mobile, willing to engage in high-profit but unwilling to engage in low-profit) in a few units. Party organizations at all levels in Jiangxi Province must conscientiously summarize the creations and inventions of the masses and actively promote advanced experiences.

Persisting in putting politics in command and strengthening the Party's leadership over industrial support for agriculture is the fundamental guarantee for completing the above tasks. Party committees at all levels must deeply carry out education on industrial support for agriculture, criticize various erroneous ideas, and make all workers and staff realize that industrial support for agriculture and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture is the glorious task of the industrial front, and lay a solid ideological foundation for implementing the policy of industrial support for agriculture. As the spring plowing production is approaching, we must mobilize all workers and staff to find ways to strive to complete the various machinery and materials needed to support agriculture ahead of schedule and in excess. We must publicize to the workers and staff that providing agriculture with one more horsepower of power machine is equivalent to increasing eight laborers; one season earlier is equivalent to one year earlier. At the same time, we must widely carry out technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial front, and advance to mechanization and semi-mechanization in an all-round way, in order to improve labor productivity and resolutely achieve that old enterprises increase production without increasing people, and new enterprises increase production more and decrease people less. At present, all industrial and mining enterprises should focus on departments with heavy manual operations and high labor occupancy in loading, unloading, handling, and production processes inside and outside the factory, and launch a mass movement to vigorously engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization, striving to save a large number of labor forces and minimize the transfer of labor forces from rural areas (the plan to transfer labor forces must be guaranteed to be completed on time and in quantity). This is the most direct and effective measure for the current industrial front to support agriculture.

Secondly, we must adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs" and adhere to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. On the one hand, we must actively develop the production of modern agricultural machinery, power stations, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides. In particular, the Jiangxi Tractor Factory must be quickly and fully completed and start batch production. This is the backbone force for Jiangxi's agricultural technological transformation. Hydropower and thermal power stations must speed up the construction progress. This is the prerequisite for realizing agricultural technological transformation and developing industrial construction. On the other hand, which is also the main aspect at present, is to mobilize the broad masses to vigorously carry out technological reforms, transform old farm tools, and promote improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools. People's communes should develop more small-scale industries, such as small power stations, indigenous fertilizer plants, machinery plants, and farm tool repair plants, without affecting agricultural production. The agricultural machinery plants of the People's Commune should adopt the method of "agriculture proposes the topic, industry writes the article", and make more and better improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools for agricultural production in accordance with local conditions and seasons to meet the needs of current agricultural technological transformation; farm tool repair plants should plan to realize the repair of tractors and various farm tools from "small repairs not leaving the commune, large repairs not leaving the county" to "small repairs not leaving the team, large repairs not leaving the commune", to improve the efficiency of agricultural machinery use.

Again, training agricultural technical talents with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is an urgent task before us. Everyone knows that machines need people to master them. To realize agricultural modernization in Jiangxi, a huge number of technical teams are needed. We must regard the work of training agricultural technical talents as equally important as the work of realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has decided to establish an industrial labor university, which has opened up a broad path for training industrial and agricultural construction talents with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. People's communes should also strengthen the technical training of young and middle-aged farmers in a planned way according to the needs of agricultural technological transformation and the development of commune-run industries. Technical training classes, night schools, and spare-time cultural schools should also include agricultural technology as a compulsory course; especially in production, we should adopt the method of old hands leading new hands and masters leading apprentices to generally improve the technical level of farmers.

Finally, Jiangxi Province has now universally established various committees and leading groups for industrial support for agriculture. The current problem is to earnestly grasp the work and make these organizations truly play their role. In these organizations, there must be dedicated personnel responsible for the work, regularly check, summarize and exchange experiences, and report the situation to the Party Committee in a timely manner. Grasp several times a year in a planned way to combine shock movements with regular work to promote the rapid development of agricultural technological transformation.

    加速农业技术改造是工业战线的光荣任务
    中共江西省委书记处书记　白栋材
    党中央和毛泽东同志指示我们：必须加强工业对农业的支援，加速农业技术改造。江西省广大职工对于党中央的指示，表现了最大的热情，他们把支援农业、实现农业技术改造，看成是自己责无旁贷的、光荣的政治任务。目前各地区、各有关企业正在轰轰烈烈地掀起工业支援农业的群众运动。在运动中，广大职工干劲十足，信心百倍地要求在春耕生产以前完成江西59型插秧机十万部、拖拉机四十台或更多一些、排灌机械二万六千二百马力、半机械化农具十五万四千件、改良农具七十五万件、小农具八十九万件，以支援今年农业生产的大跃进。
    对于工业支援农业、加速农业技术改造的重大政治意义，大多数职工是清楚的，并在实际工作中做出了很好的成绩。但是并不是所有的人都认识很清楚了，没有问题了，有些同志的思想还是比较模糊的。要在所有的人特别是工业干部中树立工业支援农业的牢固思想，还需要做许多的政治思想工作。
    有些同志认为，现在提出加速农业技术改造条件不成熟，要慢慢来。是条件不成熟吗？不是，是这些同志的思想落后于社会主义建设的实际。他们看不到江西省经过第一个五年计划的建设和1958年、1959年的连续大跃进，工业有了巨大的发展，钢铁、机械等工业都已经有了一定基础。同时，还要看到几年来，特别是大跃进以来培养了一大批新的技术力量。这就为加速农业技术改造准备了物质条件。
    人民公社的建立，为加速农业技术改造、实现农业现代化创造了极为有利的社会条件。人民公社这种新的生产关系和新的社会组织形式，可以最迅速地促进社会生产力的发展，为加速农业技术改造开辟了广阔的道路。大家看到，由于人民公社能够最合理地安排人力和最充分地利用自然资源，实现生产不断跃进，因而积累迅速增多，许多公社已经积累了相当数量的资金，迫切要求购买各种农业机械。
    由此可见，加速农业技术改造的物质条件和社会条件都是具备的，问题的关键在于：是“慢慢来”呢？还是鼓足干劲，充分发挥人的主观能动性，加速农业的技术改造？我们的答复是后者而不是前者。只有这样，才能满足农业技术改造的需要，大力给农民以支援；只有这样，才能迅速地把农业从落后的手工劳动转移到大机器生产，高速度地提高农业劳动生产率，提高农产品的商品率；也只有这样，才能在新的基础上进一步巩固工农联盟，促进社会主义工业化。当然，在飞跃前进的道路上，由于速度加快，任务加大，自然会出现一些新问题、新困难，譬如各项任务加大和劳动力之间的矛盾，生产与某些原料、材料和技术供应之间的矛盾等等。这些困难并不是占主导地位的，占主导地位的是如我们上面所说的有利条件。我们前进中的困难，完全可以在党的领导下，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，大搞协作加以解决。“慢慢来”的思想显然不符合党中央和毛泽东同志提出的大力支援农业、加速农业技术改造的要求，也是违反鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的。
    其次，有些工业干部只知道工业重要，而不懂得农业同样重要。这种思想是片面的、错误的。应当肯定，社会主义工业是整个国民经济的主导，没有重工业的优先发展，没有社会主义工业化就谈不上农业现代化。但是也一定要懂得农业是整个国民经济的基础。社会主义工业建设首先要依靠农业。我国社会主义建设实践证明，农业大丰收的第二年都带来了工业大跃进。农业的丰歉，决定工业和整个国民经济发展速度的快慢。因为，发展工业，首先要吃饭要粮食，第二要原料，第三要市场，第四要劳动力。这几条完全或主要来自农业。农业落后必然影响工业的发展，这是显而易见的道理。
    党的社会主义建设的总路线和它所包括的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，其中就有：在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针。采取这个方针就使我们在经济建设的跃进中避免了只重视工业而忽视农业，只重视重工业而忽视轻工业的片面性。这条方针，正确反映了生产资料生产优先增长的条件下两大部类比例关系的客观规律的要求。几年来的经验证明：既放手地发展工业，又放手地发展农业；一方面搞工业建设，一方面把人民生活搞好（搞好生活主要靠农业，人们生活中最主要的生活资料来自农业，轻工业原料大部分也来自农业），生产和生活两条腿走路，就可以使我国国民经济既高速度又按比例的发展。所有这一切，都是马克思列宁主义宝库中的极为重大的发展，今后政治经济学要大书特书的。
    第三，有些工业干部，没有深刻了解社会主义工业化和农业现代化之间的关系。他们不知道，没有工业化，就不能促进农业现代化，而没有农业的现代化，也就不可能完成社会主义工业化。不可能设想，社会主义可以长久建立在一方面是先进技术的工业，一方面是落后技术的农业的基础上。要是这样，工业和农业不可能相适应的发展，社会主义工业化就会遇到绝大的困难，也就不可能完全实现社会主义工业化。只有逐步地把工业和农业建立在现代化的大生产的基础上，才能使工业和农业相适应的高速度的发展，才能把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。刘少奇同志在党的八届二次会议的报告中说：“在技术革命方面，主要的任务是：把包括农业和手工业在内的全国经济有计划有步骤地转到新的技术基础上，转到现代化大生产的技术基础上，使一切能够使用机器的劳动都使用机器，实现全国城市和农村的电气化；……”可见，把社会主义工业化和农业现代化割裂开来的观点是站不住脚的。
    第四，还有些干部说，工业支援农业会影响工业的发展。这种观点也是片面的，工业支援农业同时也发展了工业，农业机械、电站、化肥厂等本身就是工业嘛！发展工业和支援农业技术改造并不矛盾。相反，可以大大促进工业的发展。我以为这是非常明显易懂的道理，毋须多加解释。
    根据江西省具体情况，实现农业机械化、农田水利化、农村电气化，大体需要拖拉机七万五千台到八万台和相应的播种、插秧、收割、脱粒等农业机械，二十五万马力的排灌设备，四百五十万瓩左右的发电量等。实现这个伟大的任务，在步骤上，有些可以早些，如水利化，有些需要经过较长时间的努力，如机械化；有些还需要更长一点的时间，如电气化。但是我们不能坐待，必须积极为逐步实现这个宏伟的奋斗目标而斗争。目前，又必须大搞技术改革，推广改良农具和半机械化农具，改造现有旧农具。1960年，我们的初步安排是：增加拖拉机五百标准台和相应的机引农具一千九百台，增加电力绳索牵引机六百套，增加机械排灌设备四万五千马力，增加农村发电装机容量一万瓩，增加化学肥料十八万至十九万吨。与此同时，还要积极推广半机械化农具和改良农具，计划添置双轮双铧犁二千部，江西59型插秧机十五万部，薯片切丝机十万部，其它加工机械一万七千部，手推胶轮车三十六万部，畜力胶轮车四万五千套。全省所有的农业机械企业，必须努力完成和超额完成国家所规定的生产和修配任务，制造和修配的产品必须做到“保用、保教、保修”，坚决克服少数单位所谓三愿三不愿（愿制造不愿修配、愿固定不愿流动、愿搞利润大的不愿搞利润小的）的错误思想。江西省各级党组织，必须认真总结群众的创造发明，积极推广先进经验。
    坚持政治挂帅，加强党对工业支援农业的领导，是完成上述任务的根本保证。各级党委，必须深入开展工业支援农业的教育，批判各种错误思想，使全体职工认识到工业支援农业、加速农业的技术改造是工业战线的光荣任务，为贯彻执行工业支援农业的方针奠定巩固的思想基础，当此春耕生产在即，必须发动全体职工想方设法，力争提前超额完成支援农业的各种机械和所需要的物资。要向职工宣传，多给农业提供一马力的动力机，便等于增加八个劳动力；提前一季，便等于提前一年的道理。同时在工业战线要广泛地开展技术革新和技术革命，向机械化半机械化全面进军，以提高劳动生产率，坚决做到老企业增产不增人，新企业多增产少增人，当前所有工矿企业都应围绕厂内外装卸搬运和生产过程中用手工操作占用劳动力多的部门，开展大搞机械化半机械化的群众运动，力争节约大批的劳动力，尽量少从农村中抽调劳动力（上调劳动力的计划，必须保证按时按量完成）。这是当前工业战线支援农业的最直接最有效的措施。
    其次，我们必须坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，坚持土洋结合的原则。一方面，积极发展现代化农业机械、电站、化学肥料和农药的生产。特别是要把江西拖拉机厂迅速全面建成，开始成批生产，这是江西农业技术改造的骨干力量。水电、火电站要加快建设进度，这是实现农业技术改造，发展工业建设的前提条件。另一方面，也是当前主要的方面，就是要发动广大群众大搞技术改革，改造旧农具，推广改良农具和半机械化农具。人民公社应当在不影响农业生产的前提下，多发展一些小型工业，如小电站、土化肥厂、机械厂、农具修配厂等。人民公社的农业机械厂应当采取“农业出题目，工业做文章”的办法，因地、因时制宜地为农业生产更多更好的改良农具和半机械化农具，满足当前农业技术改造的需要；农具修配厂要有计划地做到将拖拉机和各种农具修配工作从“小修不出社，大修不出县”到“小修不出队，大修不出社”，提高农业机械的使用效能。
    再次，多快好省地培养农业技术人材，是摆在我们面前的迫切任务。大家知道，机器是要人来掌握的。实现江西的农业现代化，需要有数量庞大的技术队伍。我们要把培养农业技术人材的工作，看成与实现农业机械化、电气化的工作同等重要。江西省委决定创办工业劳动大学，这为多快好省地培养工农业建设人材开辟了一条广阔的道路。人民公社也要根据农业技术改造和发展社办工业的需要，有计划地加强对青壮年农民的技术训练。举办技术训练班、夜校和业余文化学校也应把农业技术列为必修课程；特别在生产中要采取老手带新手、师傅带徒弟的办法，把农民的技术水平普遍提高一步。
    最后，江西省现在已经普遍建立了工业支援农业的各种委员会和领导小组。现在的问题是把工作认真地抓起来，使这些组织真正发挥它的作用。在这些组织中一定要有专人负责工作，经常检查总结交流经验，及时向党委汇报情况。一年中有计划地抓几次，做到突击运动与经常工作相结合，以推动农业技术改造的迅速发展。
