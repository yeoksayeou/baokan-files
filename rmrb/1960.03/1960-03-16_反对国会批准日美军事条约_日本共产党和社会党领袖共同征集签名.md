Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 15th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka and Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma jointly collected signatures in front of Shinbashi Station in Tokyo today to oppose the National Assembly's approval of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

This signature campaign was jointly organized by the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Maintenance of Peace and Democracy. The signature campaign has been launched throughout Japan since February 3rd.

Asanuma said to pedestrians at the station: "Peace-loving people, people who oppose conscription! Please sign the petition!"

Nosaka called on the people gathered in front of the station to sign the petition. Nosaka pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke group is already in a difficult position in the National Assembly due to the opposition party's criticism.

Many workers, young people, female students, and mothers with children signed the petition after listening to the speeches of these political leaders. One hundred and fifty people in front of eight stations in Tokyo today collected signatures against the approval of the new "Security Treaty." Socialist Party Councilor Saburo Eda and Communist Party Congressman Yoshio Shiga also participated in today's signature collection campaign. (Attached picture)
