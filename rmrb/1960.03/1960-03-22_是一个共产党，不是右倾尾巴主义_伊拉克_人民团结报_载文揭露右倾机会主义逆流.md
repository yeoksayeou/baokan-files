　　It Is a Communist Party, Not Right-Wing Tailism
　　Iraqi Newspaper "People's Solidarity" Publishes Article Exposing the Right-Opportunist Countercurrent

　　This newspaper reports that the Iraqi Communist Party's organ "People's Solidarity" published an article by Muhammad Hussein A-leis on January 19, entitled: "It Is a Communist Party, Not Right-Wing Tailism."

　　The article pointed out that Comrade Fahd refuted the concepts utterly devoid of common ground with Marxism-Leninism held by the opportunist groups at that time (1944) in the booklet "Is a Communist Party, Not Democratic Socialism." These groups included the "League of Iraqi Communists." Now, because no one in Iraq can ignore our Communist Party and its glorious struggle, the opportunist groups have dared to usurp the name "Communist Party," attempting to disguise their sabotage activities as normal activities, so that when one or both parties are approved in the end, either they merge with the Communist Party or the Party merges with their opportunist groups. There is no doubt that this attempt of theirs cannot conceal the roots and purposes of their opportunist movement, nor its distant and immediate causes.

　　The activities of the new impostor communists are not something unexpected. The problem is not the problem of a few individuals. Even if these people did not come forward to submit applications for pseudo-communist parties, as long as the objective and subjective conditions of the revolution allow it, the enemies of the working class and the national movement will certainly find other running dogs to engage in this kind of activity. Because in any class society experiencing a revolutionary period when the contradictions between the entire people and their enemies, the colonialists and feudalists, are becoming acute and contradictions within the people's ranks are constantly emerging, the enemies of the working class and the laboring people of all strata and classes must use the vacillating elements in the petty bourgeoisie to spread non-revolutionary concepts among the people and attempt to divert the nationalist movement from its correct revolutionary direction.

　　The article pointed out that the purpose of the new opportunist movement is to first create obstacles to the legalization of the Communist Party, try to corrupt the democratic life of our Republic, then declare the failure of democratic life, and exonerate and support the anti-democratic and reactionary policies of Iraq and abroad.

　　But the purpose of this movement does not stop there, nor does it stop at splitting the unity of the national ranks -- as can be clearly seen in some provocative articles published in "Al-Mabda' newspaper" to alienate the three patriotic parties -- but fundamentally to subordinate the interests of the working class, peasants, and laboring masses to the interests of the people's enemies, and to divert the revolutionary movement from its correct path. This will be achieved by controlling the Communist Party, shifting its policies to the right, turning it into a tail of the bourgeoisie, opposing the revolutionary direction of the national movement, so that the people's enemies, the imperialists and reactionaries, can strike at the revolutionary fruits of the people. This explains why the opportunist movement has been hailed by radio stations in London and Israel.

　　The article said that the opportunists place the responsibility for a series of events suffered by the Republic on the Communist Party, and in this they are exactly the same as all the enemies of the Communist Party and the working class. The imperialist trumpets once blamed the conspiracy on the entire Iraqi people and their patriotic government, and considered the conspirators to be victims of aggression. When they found that they could not deceive, they began to try to split the ranks, and began to concentrate on slandering the Communist Party. The domestic imperialist agents and reactionaries began to pretend to support the patriotic government and the leaders of the Republic in order to smuggle in their slanders, until this conspiracy of theirs was also exposed. Now the opportunists are attempting to concentrate their attacks on the Communist Party with the same slanders, and their purpose is exactly the same: to condemn the correct revolutionary direction followed by the revolution and adopted by all loyal parties, including our Communist Party.

　　No loyal patriot would doubt that the situation of our revolution requires resolutely dealing with the enemies of the revolution, relying on the masses of the people, bringing into play the revolutionary energy of the masses, helping them organize themselves, unifying their ranks, and encouraging their revolutionary enthusiasm, in order to defend the Republic in the face of the enemies at home and abroad who are lying in wait. However, the opportunists are not satisfied with the Party's dedication to mobilizing the masses of the people and igniting their patriotic enthusiasm to defend the Republic. After criticizing the mass movement and calling it a spontaneous movement, they criticized the Party leadership for "using all the strength of the Party to incite this movement and encourage comrades to do so. ... The leadership spent all the energy of the Party in the entire year after the founding of our democratic republic organizing grand festivals, parades, and writing slogans...etc." The powerful mass movement sparked by the July 14th liberation revolution, a mass movement that the imperialists and their agents have regarded as a thorn in their side in the past and present, was the strongest pillar of our democratic republic and the fear of the Republic's enemies. And this movement is the target of criticism and resentment by the opportunists. So what do they want the Party to do? What policies do they propose to replace the Party's revolutionary mass policy? What kind of struggle can replace mass struggle? They want the Party to abandon mass work and revolutionary struggle. This is the goal of all opportunists in every era and every place, and this is what the enemies of the Iraqi people and the Republic hope for.

　　The article said that in order to realize their plan to place the responsibility for all events on the Communist Party instead of criticizing the Party's general policy, the opportunists also place the responsibility for the cracks appearing between the national forces on the Party. Is this really the case? Of course not. Only those with ulterior motives, or those who do not conduct a scientific analysis of the revolution and society when observing this issue, or who ignore the facts shown by the historical process, can say such a thing.

　　The objective conditions for unifying the ranks can only be met when all patriotic forces understand that the imperialist conspiracy is still continuing, that relying on the people is the only way to resist the conspiracy and defend the Republic, and are convinced that removing all pressure on the masses and allowing them to move forward bravely is a reliable way to avoid danger (which Iran, Jordan, and Syria have suffered in the past); and the special experiences of the people and patriotic forces are enough to convince everyone of this.

　　The characteristics of what the opportunists write and "their analysis" are to ignore the danger of imperialism and the reactionaries, to downplay the role of this danger, and finally to remain silent about this danger, while using all their strength to oppose the revolutionary direction.

　　From this it is also clear what the purpose is of the opportunists blaming the split in the national ranks on the Communist Party, and attempting to push the Communist Party to support the wrong positions in the national movement and turn the Party into the tail of the national movement.

　　Comrade Fahd said it well: "Opportunism is a docile tool of the bourgeoisie in the ranks of the working class, and a docile tool of imperialism in the ranks of the national movement."

　　The article exposes the revisionist views of the opportunists in the past, present, and future on society and the revolutionary movement. This view means denying the role of the working class in defending the Republic and all revolutionary movements, and its mass struggle; obliterating class distinctions; ignoring the nature of every class in society, thereby denying the necessity of the independent political organization of the working class and the vanguard role of this political organization in the national front. This view is also the view of the Yugoslav revisionists. Their views on the future of our country's economic development also confirm this. Because when the social relations of production in our country have bourgeois (rather than socialist) class relations, and the establishment and development of our national economy by no means implies the establishment and development of socialism, the opportunist groups call for "paving the way for consolidating our national economy to develop towards a socialist economy, so as to realize a socialist society in our country." This concept obliterates the distinction between capitalism and socialism and the distinction between various classes. This is a repetition of the concept of the Yugoslav revisionists in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia claims that socialism is formed within the capitalist system, and the state apparatus of the bourgeoisie is changing under this trend. The League defends the theory that capitalism grows into socialism; obliterates the role of Marxist-Leninist parties, etc.

　　Starting from their right-wing revisionist concepts, the opportunists finally advocate the removal of the leadership of the Communist Party, and the Party's leadership is a key issue. Because if they are unable to control the Party's leadership and make the Party serve their opportunist goals against the working class and the national movement, their attacks on the Party's general policy and slander of the Party are meaningless to them. As long as the Party's leadership can be maintained, it is not easy for them to do so. Therefore, removing the Party's leadership has become their main slogan, while fighting against imperialism and the reactionaries and defending the Republic are not their main slogans. Please readers look at what they wrote in their newspaper on January 5, 1960: "These people who have made mistakes must be removed from their leading positions. Without realizing this removal, the first step in discussing the issue has loopholes. We call on the leading cadres who have not participated in the Party's leadership and the cadres who have been placed in unimportant positions within the Party to discuss the plan for organizing the Communist Party." In many destructive appeals published in their newspapers, they describe their main task as follows: "The current main task of the Party that falls on our shoulders is to rescue our glorious Party from its current leadership."

　　Their task is not what they openly say, which is to defend the Republic and fight against imperialism and the reactionaries; not to mobilize the masses and raise the revolutionary vigilance of the masses to support the Republic's just struggle against conspiracies and the crazy enemies at home and abroad; not to strengthen the democratic road of the Republic and develop it as a basic guarantee for defending the Republic; not to defend the freedom, rights, and dignity of the laboring masses -- the laboring masses who have suffered and are still suffering from the reactionary unjust attacks, slanders, and conspiracies -- their task is only to focus on "removing" the Party's leadership.

　　Please see, what more can the imperialists and reactionaries expect from the fake "Marxist-Leninists" than this?

　　These opportunists have learned from their special experience of opposing the Communist Party that "removing the Party's leadership" is the first step in their opportunist schemes. Without realizing this, "other steps will be invalidated."

　　The article pointed out that in the circumstances experienced by our Republic, it is not surprising that some individuals in the working class make some mistakes. No sensible person can deny the complexity of the situation that occurred after the Iraqi revolution and closely followed the Iraqi revolutionary movement. It is not a matter of great alarm that mistakes may occur in such a complex situation.

　　Nevertheless, our Party quickly overcame its mistakes, and such speed was admired by all who were loyal to the Party and to Marxism-Leninism.

　　The Party, in general, is established, developed, and strengthened in the course of revolutionary struggle. In the course of this struggle, it is inevitable that it will make various mistakes; but it accumulates experience and draws lessons from experience to make itself stronger and more experienced. Our Party lost its experienced and tested leadership in 1949. In this case, the Party only had one way to cultivate new leadership, which is the path of revolutionary struggle, the persistence of the Party's loyal comrades, and their study of the Party's experience under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory, as well as their own experience. The actual situation is like this. The Party's leadership has been formed, and it has shouldered the historical tasks that have fallen on it. It has made mistakes, and it has learned lessons from its mistakes, until the leadership experience is fully mature. Everyone who is loyal to the Party and the working class can see that our Party's current leadership is more experienced and more mature than ever before. Is "being loyal to Marxist-Leninist theory" to remove such loyal and tested leadership? Of course not, only those with ulterior motives who do not care about the fate of the Party, the working class, and the national movement would call for this. Those people collude with the reactionaries, repeat their slanders, and surrender in the face of their unjust attacks against our people and our democratic Republic.

　　When discussing the fate of opportunism in Iraq, the article pointed out that, undoubtedly, whether in Iraq or in any other country, the ultimate fate of opportunism is inevitable failure; and the inevitable victory is the proletarian ideology represented by Marxist-Leninist theory. However, this fact should never make us underestimate the importance of conducting an ideological struggle against opportunist concepts. Because as long as the petty-bourgeois mode of production is a general feature of our country's production, as long as petty-bourgeois ideology, including its unease and vacillation, dominates society, the possibility of opportunist countercurrents emerging and using it to oppose the revolutionary movement will exist. If the vanguard of the working class does not fight against this trend of thought among the laboring masses and defeat it to ensure the victory of the working class's ideology, the danger of this thought will continue to exist.

　　It is for this reason that our Communist Party has launched a resolute struggle against the erroneous thoughts that have emerged in all opportunist trends of thought and movements. This guarantees on the one hand that opportunism is defeated and on the other hand that the ideological steadfastness of revolutionary fighters is strengthened.

　　In Comrade Fahd's era, our Party struggled against right-wing opportunism that attempted to obstruct the construction of a Marxist-Leninist party, and also struggled against the "left" tendency that attempted to obstruct the Party from becoming a mass party. The Party has also struggled against right and "left" errors in the future. The Party has grown stronger in this struggle, has become more experienced, and is more able to overcome opportunist tendencies.

　　When some "left"-leaning errors occurred last summer, our Party quickly and resolutely exposed and corrected these errors and used these errors to educate Party members and the laboring masses.

　　As everyone knows, opposing one erroneous tendency will lead to some opposite erroneous tendencies. When the Party opposes its "left" errors, it is expected that a right-opportunist countercurrent may emerge; but because of the Party's ideological strength, this right-wing countercurrent has not emerged in the Party's ranks, but this countercurrent comes from outside the Party, from the old opportunists. These elements have been waiting for an opportunity for a long time; because they think the opportunity has arrived, they have committed their heinous deeds, and want to test their bad luck in the face of the consciousness and revolutionary spirit of our working class.

　　We should constantly oppose both the "left" and the right; however, our subjective conditions and the current objective conditions, as well as the international conditions, all require (us) to oppose with the greatest strength the right-wing revisionist opportunism aimed at making the worker movement and the national movement lose their revolutionary spirit.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Revisionism, or right-wing opportunism, is a bourgeois ideology, and it is more dangerous than dogmatism. Revisionists, right-wing opportunists, also hang Marxism on their lips, and they are also attacking 'dogmatism' there. But what they are attacking is precisely the most fundamental thing of Marxism."

　　The declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in 1957 wrote: "Under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism. It is the manifestation of bourgeois ideology, it paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class, and calls for the preservation or restoration of capitalism."

　　All those who are loyal to the revolutionary movement, the working class, and its political party should fight against the new right-opportunist countercurrent, expose its true goals and the harm of its ideology to the worker movement and our country's national revolutionary movement, in order to smash a pillar on which the reactionaries and imperialists rely in their desperate attempt to oppose our Republic and its promising democratic future.

### 是一个共产党，不是右倾尾巴主义  伊拉克“人民团结报”载文揭露右倾机会主义逆流

    是一个共产党，不是右倾尾巴主义
    伊拉克“人民团结报”载文揭露右倾机会主义逆流
    本报讯　伊拉克共产党机关报“人民团结报”1月19日刊载了一篇穆罕默德·侯赛因·阿—勒伊斯所写的文章，标题是：“是一个共产党，不是右倾尾巴主义”。
    文章指出，费赫德同志在“是共产党，不是民主社会主义”小册子里驳斥了当时（1944年）机会主义集团所具有的、与马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处的概念。这些集团中有“伊拉克共产党人联盟”。现在由于在伊拉克没有人能够无视我们共产党和我们党的光荣斗争，机会主义集团竟冒用了“共产党”的名字，企图把他们的破坏活动装扮成一种正常活动，到最后，在两个党中的一个或全都被批准时，要么他们与共产党合并，要么党与他们的机会主义集团合并。没有疑问，他们的这种企图是不能掩盖他们的机会主义运动的根源和目的及其远因和近因的。
    新的冒牌共产主义者的活动并不是什么预料之外的事情。问题并不是某几个人的问题，即便没有这些人挺身提出伪共产党的申请，但只要革命的客观条件和主观条件允许这样做，工人阶级和民族运动的敌人就一定会找到另外一些鹰犬来搞这种活动。因为在经历着全体人民和他们的敌人殖民主义者与封建主义者之间的矛盾趋于尖锐和人民队伍内部矛盾不断出现的革命时期的任何一个阶级社会里，工人阶级和各阶层各阶级的劳动人民的敌人必然要利用小资产阶级中的动摇不安分子在人民中间散布非革命的概念，并企图使民族主义运动脱离它的正确的革命方针。
    文章指出，新机会主义运动的目的，就是先在共产党合法化问题上制造障碍，设法使我们共和国的民主生活变质，然后宣告民主生活失败，为伊拉克国内外反民主的反动方针开脱罪责，并予以支持。
    但是，这一运动的目的还不仅止于此，也不仅止于分裂民族队伍的统一——如在“原则报”为离间三个爱国政党而发表的一些挑拨性文章中可以清楚看出的那样——而在根本上是要使工人阶级、农民和劳动群众的利益服从人民敌人的利益，并使革命运动脱离它的正确轨道。这将通过控制共产党、使它的政策向右倾，把它变成资产阶级的尾巴，反对民族运动的革命方针，以便人民的敌人帝国主义者和反动派能于打击人民的革命果实。这就说明为什么机会主义运动会受到伦敦和以色列电台的欢呼。
    文章说，机会主义者把共和国所遭到的一系列事件的责任推在共产党身上，他们在这一点上同共产党和工人阶级的一切敌人一模一样。帝国主义喇叭曾经把阴谋的责任推给全体伊拉克人民及其爱国政府，并认为阴谋分子是侵犯的牺牲者。他们发现不能欺骗了，于是就开始设法分裂队伍，开始集中诽谤共产党。国内的帝国主义代理人和反动派开始假装支持爱国政府和共和国领导人，以便偷运他们的诽谤，一直到他们这一阴谋也宣告败露。现在机会主义者企图以同样的诽谤来集中反对共产党，他们的目的也毫无二致，那就是给革命所遵循的、为包括我们共产党在内的各个忠诚方面所采取的正确的革命方针定下罪名。
    任何一个忠诚的爱国者都不会怀疑我们革命的形势要求坚决对付革命的敌人，依靠人民群众，发挥群众的革命精力，帮助他们组织自己，统一他们的队伍，鼓励他们的革命热情，以便在国内外伺机而动的敌人的队伍面前保卫共和国。但是，机会主义者不满意党致力于动员人民群众，燃起群众保卫共和国的爱国热情。在他们批评群众运动并把它称为自发运动以后，他们批评党的领导“使用党的全部力量来煽起这种运动并鼓动同志们这样做。……领导在我们民主共和国成立后的整整一年中把党的全部精力用来组织大联欢、游行和写口号……等等。”7月14日的解放革命所掀起的强大的群众运动，过去和现在被帝国主义者及其代理人视为眼中钉的群众运动，曾经是我们民主共和国的最强大的支柱，也是共和国敌人的恐惧所在。而这种运动却是机会主义者批评和愤恨的目标。那么他们希望党作什么呢？他们提出来取代党的革命的群众政策的政策是什么呢？什么样的斗争能够代替群众斗争呢？他们要党放弃群众工作和革命斗争，这就是每个时代和每个地方的所有机会主义者的目标，这就是伊拉克人民和共和国的敌人所希望的。
    文章说，为了实现他们把所有事件责任推给共产党并非难党的总政策的计划，机会主义者把民族力量之间出现裂痕的责任也推在党的身上。真是这样吗？当然不是。只有别有用心的人或者在观察这一问题时对革命和社会不进行科学分析或无视历史进程所表明的事实的人才能说这样的话。
    在一切爱国力量都了解到帝国主义阴谋仍在继续、依靠人民是抗击阴谋与保卫共和国的唯一道路、确信解除对群众的一切压力使其勇往直前乃是避免危险（过去伊朗、约旦和叙利亚都曾受到这种危险）的可靠道路的时候，统一队伍的客观条件才能具备；而人民和爱国力量的特殊经验是足以使大家确信这一点的。
    机会主义者所写的东西和“他们的分析”的特点，就是无视帝国主义和反动派的危险，轻视这种危险的作用，最后闭口不谈这种危险，而以全力来反对革命方针。
    由此也清楚地看出机会主义把分裂民族队伍的责任推到共产党身上以及企图推动共产党去支持民族运动中的错误立场和把党变成民族运动的尾巴的目的何在了。
    费赫德同志说得好：“机会主义是资产阶级在工人阶级队伍中的驯服工具，是帝国主义在民族运动队伍中的驯服工具”。
    文章揭露机会主义者在过去、现在和未来对社会和对革命运动的修正主义看法。这种看法，意味着否认工人阶级在保卫共和国和所有革命运动中的作用及其群众性斗争；抹煞阶级区别；忽视社会上每一个阶级的性质，因而否认工人阶级政治组织独立的必要性和这种政治组织在民族阵线中的先锋作用。这种观点也就是南斯拉夫修正主义者的观点。他们对我国经济发展前途的看法也肯定了这一点。因为在我国社会生产关系具有资产阶级的（而不是社会主义的）阶级关系和我国民族经济的建立和发展无论如何也不意味着建立和发展社会主义这样一些特点的时候，机会主义集团号召“为巩固我们的民族经济使之向社会主义经济发展铺平道路，以便在我国实现社会主义社会。”这种概念抹煞资本主义和社会主义之间的区别和各个阶级间的区别。这是重复南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中的南斯拉夫修正主义者的概念。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟声称社会主义在资本主义制度以内形成，资产阶级的国家机器在这种趋势下改变着。该联盟为资本主义长入社会主义的理论辩护；抹煞马克思列宁主义政党的作用等等。
    机会主义者从他们的右的修正主义的概念出发，终于主张撤销共产党的领导，而党的领导则是一个关键问题。因为如果他们不能够控制党的领导权使党服务于他们反工人阶级和民族运动的机会主义目的，他们攻击党的总政策和对党进行诽谤，对他们来说，就什么意义都没有了。只要能维护党的领导，他们就不易于这样做。因此，撤销党的领导就成了他们的主要口号，而对帝国主义和反动派进行斗争和保卫共和国则不是他们的主要的口号了。请读者看看他们于1960年1月5日在他们的报纸上所写的东西：“必须把这些犯错误的人从他们的领导地位上清除出去。不实现这种清除，讨论问题的第一步就有漏洞。我们号召没有参加党的领导的领导分子和被领导置于党内不重要地位的分子来讨论组织共产党的计划。”在多次发表于他们的报纸上的破坏性呼吁书中，他们描述他们的主要任务如下：“落在我们肩上的党的当前主要任务，就是把我们光荣的党从它目前的领导中抢救出来”。
    他们的任务，不像他们公开说的那样是什么保卫共和国和对帝国主义和反动派进行斗争；不是动员群众和提高群众的革命警觉性来支持共和国对阴谋诡计和国内外的疯狂敌人进行正义斗争；不是加强共和国的民主道路和把它作为保卫共和国的基本保证来加以发展；不是保卫劳动人民群众的自由、权利和尊严——劳动人民群众曾经并且仍在遭受着反动的不义攻击、诽谤和阴谋——，他们的任务不过是集中于“撤销”党的领导。
    请看，帝国主义和反动派所指望于假“马克思列宁主义”者的还能比这再多吗？
    这些机会主义者从他们反对共产党的特殊经验中了解到“撤销党的领导”是他们机会主义计谋的第一步。不实现这一点，“其他步骤就归无效”。
    文章指出，在我们共和国所经历的情况下，工人阶级中的个别人犯一些错误，是不足为奇的。任何一个有理智的人都不能够否认在伊拉克革命以后发生的和紧跟着伊拉克革命运动的局势的复杂性。在这样复杂的情况下可能发生错误，是一件不足以引起大惊小怪的事情。
    尽管如此，我们党还是迅速地克服了自己的错误，这样的迅速曾为一切忠于党和忠于马克思列宁主义的人们所赞佩。
    党，一般是在革命斗争的过程中建立、发展和健全起来的。在这一斗争过程中它不免会犯各种错误；但是它积累经验，从经验中吸取教训来使自己强健起来，老练起来。我们党在1949年失去了它的具有丰富经验和经过考验的领导，在这种情况下，党只有培养新领导一条道路，这是革命斗争、党的忠诚同志的坚持性和他们在马克思列宁主义理论指导下学习党的经验以及他们自己的经验的道路。实际情况就是这样。党的领导形成了，它担负了落在它肩上的历史任务。它错误过，它从错误中吸取了教训，一直到领导经验完全成熟。每个忠于党和工人阶级的人都能看到我党现在的领导比过去任何时候都更有经验和更成熟。难道“忠于马克思列宁主义理论”就是撤销这样的忠诚的受过考验的领导吗？当然不是，只有那些不关心党、工人阶级和民族运动命运的别有用心的人才会这样号召。那些人与反动派同流合污，重复他们的诽谤，在他们反对我国人民与我们民主共和国的不义的攻击面前投降。
    文章在谈到机会主义在伊拉克的命运时指出，无疑，无论在伊拉克或是在任何其它国家，机会主义的最终命运就是必然失败；而必然胜利的是以马克思列宁主义理论为代表的无产阶级思想。但是，这一事实决不应该使我们贬低对机会主义概念进行思想斗争的重要意义。因为只要小资产阶级的生产方式是我国生产的一般特征，只要小资产阶级思想意识包括它的不安和摇摆在社会上占主导地位，那么出现机会主义逆流和利用它来反对革命运动的可能性就会存在。如果工人阶级的先锋队不在劳动群众中间同这种思潮进行斗争，击败它，以保证工人阶级思想取得胜利的话，这种思想的危险，就将会继续存在。
    就是由于这一原因，我们共产党对一切机会主义思潮和运动中出现的错误思想发动了坚决的斗争。这就一方面保证战胜机会主义，另一方面也加强了革命战士的思想上的坚定性。
    我们党在费赫德同志时代与企图阻挠建设一个马克思列宁主义政党的右倾机会主义作过斗争，也与企图阻挠使党成为一个群众性的党的“左”的倾向作过斗争。党在以后也与右的和“左”的错误作过斗争。党在这一斗争中壮大起来了，经验更加丰富了，更能于战胜机会主义倾向了。
    去年夏天发生了一些“左”倾错误的时候，我们党迅速地、坚决地揭发和纠正了这些错误，并用这些错误教育了党员和劳动群众。
    众所周知，反对一种错误倾向，是会出现一些相反的错误倾向的。当党反对它的“左”的错误时，预料可能出现一种右倾机会主义逆流；但是由于党在思想上的坚强，党的队伍中并没有产生这种右倾逆流，而这种逆流是来自党外，来自旧的机会主义分子。这些分子长期以来伺机待动；由于他们认为机会已经到来，于是就干下了他们的罪恶勾当，要在我们工人阶级的觉悟和革命性面前试试他们的倒霉的运气。
    我们应该不断地既反“左”也反右；但是，我们的主观条件和当前的客观条件以及国际条件，都要求（我们）要以最大的力量去反对旨在使工人运动和民族运动丧失革命精神的右倾修正机会主义。
    毛泽东同志说：“修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”
    1957年各国共产党和工人党宣言中写道：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。”
    一切忠于革命运动、工人阶级及其政党的人们，应该与新的右倾机会主义逆流作斗争，揭露它的真正目标和它的思想对工人运动和我国民族革命运动的危害性，以便通过这些粉碎反动派和帝国主义在他们绝望地企图反对我们共和国及其在望的民主前途时所依靠的一个支柱。
