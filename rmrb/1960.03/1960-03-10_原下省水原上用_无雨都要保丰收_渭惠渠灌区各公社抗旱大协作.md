　　This newspaper reports: The eight people's communes in the Weihui Canal irrigation area of Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, are promoting the spirit of communist collaboration, supporting production teams in their own and four other people's communes located in the arid plateau areas. They are relying on the strength of the collective to carry out a great struggle against drought.

　　Recently, members of the eight communes in this irrigation area, under the slogan of "Leave the difficulties to ourselves, and give the convenience to others," have been digging wells and irrigating the land themselves, releasing large amounts of canal water to the plateau. They have also organized more than 80,000 laborers and more than 450 technicians, with tools and livestock, to support the drought resistance efforts in the plateau areas to protect the wheat.

　　Some production teams in these eight communes are located in the Weihui Canal irrigation area below the plateau, while others are on the arid plateau. The other four communes are entirely on the arid plateau. The twelve communes have a total of 680,000 mu of wheat fields, of which 310,000 mu are on the plateau. On this arid plateau, wells are generally 20 to 30 zhang deep; water conservancy conditions are very poor, with only more than 400 wells. This year, the Weibei Plateau Pumping Irrigation Project, which irrigates this part of the plateau, officially began supplying water, with the water source also coming from the Weihui Canal. Due to the drought, the canal water flow is half of what it was in previous years, which satisfies the water use of the old irrigation area below the plateau, but makes it impossible to irrigate the wheat fields on the plateau. The labor required to dig one well on the plateau is enough to dig 40 to 50 wells below the plateau. Under these circumstances, whether the wheat fields on the plateau can be irrigated has become a key factor in achieving a bumper summer harvest for these twelve communes. The common goal of the people in this area is to strive for a bumper harvest in the first season of this year through the joint efforts of the upper and lower reaches.

　　This kind of communist collaboration has developed after the people's communes were established, especially during the collaborative drought resistance efforts last year. At that time, the Xinzheng Production Team of the Mawei Commune, holding high the red banner of communist thought, had a profound impact on the thinking of commune members in this area. During the drought resistance efforts last autumn, this team dug its own wells to irrigate the autumn fields, and released the canal water to the Sangzhen Commune downstream, resulting in bumper harvests for both sides.

　　This year, the Xinzheng Production Team is holding the red banner of "Leave the difficulties to ourselves, and give the convenience to others" even higher. Some individuals in this team had complaints, saying that if they released water to other teams, their output would be higher than theirs, and they would not get any benefit. However, Zhang Mingliang, a Communist Party member and the production team leader, and the vast majority of commune members said: We are located upstream, and we feel uncomfortable seeing that the downstream has less water and lower output than us. What we want to build is communism, not just one team becoming rich, but the whole commune and the whole country becoming rich. Under the guidance of this noble thought, this team decided to not only dig more wells themselves and release more canal water to the downstream, but also actively draw out more than 2,000 strong laborers, with waterwheels and other tools, to support the drought resistance efforts in the plateau areas to irrigate the wheat.

　　The CCP Mawei Commune Committee called on all production teams in the commune to learn from the Xinzheng Production Team and promote the spirit of communist collaboration. The production teams below the plateau in this commune immediately organized more than 7,500 laborers, with more than 300 waterwheels, more than 300 carts, and more than 13,000 water-carrying tools, to help the plateau repair 182 canals, with a total length of more than 39,000 zhang, so that more than 20,000 mu of drought-stricken wheat fields on the plateau were irrigated. Then, the CCP Xingping County summarized the experience of the Mawei Commune in overcoming the spring drought by relying on the strength of the collective, and held a collaborative drought resistance on-site meeting in this commune, deciding to promote the experience of the Mawei Commune in collaborative drought resistance throughout the county. Thus, the drought resistance movement of the eight communes in the Weihui irrigation area below the plateau supporting the drought resistance efforts on the plateau was launched rapidly.

　　"The whole county is one chessboard, collaborating to resist the spring drought; the lower reaches save water for the upper reaches, ensuring a good harvest even without rain." Under this ambitious slogan, the commune members in the Weihui irrigation area have, from the Spring Festival to now, newly dug and renovated more than 4,800 water wells, saving a large amount of canal water for irrigation on the plateau. The pumping volume of the three pumping stations of the Weibei Plateau Pumping Irrigation Project has increased from the original 4.5 cubic meters per second to 9.5 cubic meters per second, and the daily irrigation area in the plateau region has increased from more than 2,000 mu to about 7,000 mu. Now, this kind of communist collaboration is developing from this irrigation area to all aspects of the county. All communes in the county have some irrigation and drainage machinery lacking some parts and unable to be used. Everyone supports each other in adjusting parts, making the original unusable pot-bellied boilers, diesel engines, and electric motors complete sets, put into irrigation in time, and increasing 15,000 mu of paddy fields.

### 原下省水原上用　无雨都要保丰收  渭惠渠灌区各公社抗旱大协作

    原下省水原上用　无雨都要保丰收
    渭惠渠灌区各公社抗旱大协作
    本报讯　陕西省兴平县渭惠渠灌溉区的八个人民公社，发扬共产主义的协作精神，支援本社和另外四个人民公社旱原地区生产队，依靠大集体的力量开展伟大的抗旱斗争。
    最近，这个灌溉区八个公社的社员在“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的口号下，自己打井浇地，把大量的渠水让给原上，并组织八万多个劳力和四百五十多个技术人员，带着工具和牲口，支援高原地区抗旱保麦。
   这八个公社，有一部份生产队在原下渭惠渠灌溉区，一部分在旱原上；另外四个公社全部在旱原上。十二个公社共有麦田六十八万亩，其中在原上的就有三十一万亩。这块旱原井深一般二十丈到三十丈；水利条件很差，只有四百多眼井。今年，灌溉这个高原部分地区的渭北高原抽水灌溉工程正式送水，水源也是从渭惠渠供应。因为天旱，渠水流量比往年减少一半，满足了原下老灌区用水，便无法灌溉原上的麦田。原上打一眼井所用的劳力，在原下就能打四、五十眼。在这种情况下，原上麦田能否灌溉，便成为这十二个公社夏季大丰收的重要关键。原上原下通力协作，争取今年第一季丰收，便是这块地区人民的共同目标。
    这种共产主义大协作，是在人民公社化后，特别是在去年协作抗旱中发展起来的。那时，高举共产主义思想红旗的马嵬公社新政生产队，在这一带社员的思想上发生了深刻的影响。去秋抗旱时，这个队自己打井灌溉秋田，把渠水让给下游的桑镇公社，结果双方都获得了大丰收。
    今年，新政生产队“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的红旗举得更高。这个队曾经有个别人有怨言，说把水让给别队，人家的产量比自己高，自己得不到利益。但是，共产党员、生产队长张明亮和绝大部分社员都说：我们处在上游，看到下游水少，产量不如我们，我们的心就难受。我们要建设的是共产主义，不是要一个队富裕，而是要全公社、全国都富裕起来。在这种高尚的思想指导下，这个队决定除了自己更多的打井，把更多的渠水让给下游外，又主动的抽出两千多个精壮劳力，带着水车等工具，支援高原地区抗旱浇麦。
    中共马嵬公社党委号召全公社各生产队向新镇生产队学习，发扬共产主义协作精神。这个公社原下各生产队立即组织了七千五百多个劳力，带着三百多部水车，三百多辆大车，一万三千多件担水工具，帮助原上修渠一百八十二条，共长三万九千多丈，使原上二万多亩受旱的麦田得到了灌溉。接着，中共兴平县总结了马嵬公社依靠大集体的力量战胜春旱的经验，在这个公社召开了协作抗旱现场会议，决定在全县范围内推广马嵬公社协作抗旱的经验。于是，原下渭惠灌区八个公社支援原上抗旱的抗旱运动，就火速地展开了。
    “全县一盘棋，协作抗春旱，原下省水原上用，无雨都要保丰收”，在这个豪迈的口号下，渭惠灌区的社员们，从春节到现在已经新打和整修了四千八百多眼水井，节省出来大量的渠水，供原上灌溉。渭北高原抽水灌溉工程三个抽水站的抽水量，由原来的四点五秒公方增加到九点五秒公方，高原地区每天日灌二千多亩增加到七千亩左右。现在，这种共产主义的协作，正在由这个灌区向全县各个方面发展中。全县各个公社都有一些缺少一些零件的排灌机械，不能使用。大家互相支援调剂零件，使原来不能使用的锅驼机、柴油机、电动机配成套，及时投入灌溉，增加了一万五千亩水田。
