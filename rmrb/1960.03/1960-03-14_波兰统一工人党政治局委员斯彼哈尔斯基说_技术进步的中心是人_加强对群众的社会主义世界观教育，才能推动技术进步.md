    Reported by this newspaper: The Polish "People's Army" magazine published an article in its second issue by Marian Spychalski, a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party and Minister of National Defense, titled "On Technological Progress and the New Man." The following is an excerpt:
    The several plenary sessions of the Central Committee following the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party have focused on eliminating the imbalances that have emerged in the process of socialist construction. These imbalances are of various natures and stem from the failure to fully grasp the rapidly developing productive forces under the people's regime and the lack of sufficient people skilled in using new technologies.
    The issue of technological progress should not be viewed as a narrow practical or purely technical matter. Technological progress is of decisive significance for socialism's victory in its economic competition with capitalism. Under socialism, technological progress, the reform of labor tools, and the transformation of the laborers themselves, liberated from capitalist shackles, are inextricably linked.
    The superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system lies first and foremost in the fact that socialism creates objective possibilities for the rapid and planned development of science and technology, thereby ensuring a faster rate of development of productive forces than capitalism. Under socialism, the utilization of this superiority and its objective possibilities depends first on the speed and level at which people master science and technology, and second on people's stance. There is a fundamental connection and dependence between the results of socialist construction and the results of ideological and political education of the people. Therefore, in all aspects of social life, the Party, as the ideological and political leading force, must put the issue of accelerating technological progress in the national economy on the agenda from the aspects of practical measures for technology management, as well as from the aspects of education, politics, and worldview.
    The achievements of the entire socialist camp in economic, scientific, and technological progress include both material and human aspects. The material aspect is that under the socialist system, the development of productive forces has unlimited possibilities. The human aspect is the cultivation of comprehensively developed new people who serve the socialist system. In socialist construction, the human aspect plays an extremely special and important role.
    How has Poland handled these two aspects? In the material aspect, great achievements have been made in industry. In the fifteen years of the people's regime, industrial production has increased four and a half times. On the other hand, we have also cultivated a large number of technical cadres. The achievements in the "material aspect" have developed along with the development of the "human aspect" of our system. The number of the working class has increased, and the ranks of the laboring intellectuals have expanded. At the same time, profound qualitative changes have taken place in society. Socialist ideas have taken root in people's hearts. The relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer. At the same time, we also feel certain weaknesses in the "human aspect" in the process of socialist construction that have not yet been overcome. These weaknesses are manifested in terms of worldview, ideology, and politics, as well as professional proficiency. The backward parts in thinking methods, habits, and culture that we inherited from the old system and have not yet been eliminated hinder our development. Capitalist remnants, various petty-bourgeois and aristocratic traditional habits in people's minds hinder our development. Therefore, today we must carry out active ideological and political work and strengthen the socialist worldview education of the masses. Without this education, the issues of technical bases, technical investment, and reforming labor tools cannot be easily resolved, nor can all the possibilities for accelerated development provided by socialist production relations and the existing technical bases be utilized. Not only Poland pays attention to this issue, but the Soviet Union, which is building an advanced stage of socialism, also regards raising the consciousness of the working people as a fundamental condition for the successful realization of the program of communist construction.
    The content of the new offensive in ideological education is to strive for technological progress and enhance the socialist consciousness of the masses. Technological progress is inseparable from correct technical norms in the production process, and it is also inseparable from appropriate work quotas. Correct technical norms are not only a lever for increasing labor productivity but also a tool for establishing new moral standards and a new attitude toward work. Therefore, the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" must not be neglected at any time. It often happens that people with low technical skills earn more than those with high technical skills, which violates moral principles. Without correct work technical norms, socialist work ethics cannot be established.
    The People's Army is a user of modern technology, so our first basic direction is to continuously improve the level of using technical weapons, skillfully and economically maintain equipment, and carry out invention and creation movements. The army is a large user of new technologies and also a school for training technical youth. Millions of young people come into contact with various complex technologies through military service, learn technology, and then transfer to the national economy, becoming a factor in raising the culture of the entire society. This is the second basic direction of our work.
    The current task of Party organizations is to enable all soldiers to understand this fundamental truth through discussion. The center of technological progress is people. In socialist society, technological progress serves people, improves people's working and living conditions, and people determine the development of technology. Therefore, the most important thing is to do people's work and cultivate people's correct attitude towards technology.

    波兰统一工人党政治局委员斯彼哈尔斯基说
    技术进步的中心是人
    加强对群众的社会主义世界观教育，才能推动技术进步
    本报讯　波兰“人民军队”杂志第二期发表了波兰统一工人党政治局委员、国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基的一篇文章：“论技术进步和新人”。摘要如下：
    波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会以后的几次中央全会，都是集中力量消除社会主义建设过程中出现的失调现象。这个失调现象具有不同的性质，它的根源是由于还未能充分掌握在人民政权条件下迅速发展的生产力和缺乏足够的使用新技术的人。
    不应当把技术进步问题看成狭隘的实际问题和纯技术问题。技术进步对于社会主义在同资本主义经济竞赛中获胜具有决定性的意义。在社会主义条件下，技术进步、劳动工具的改革同从资本主义桎梏下解放出来的劳动者本人的改造，有着不可分割的联系。
    社会主义制度之所以优越于资本主义制度，首先在于社会主义为科学技术迅速地、有计划地发展创造了客观可能性，从而保障生产力有比资本主义更快的发展速度。在社会主义条件下，利用这种优越性和它的客观可能性，首先取决于人掌握科学技术的速度和水平，另一方面，取决于人的立场。社会主义建设的结果和对人的思想政治教育结果之间存在着基本联系、基本的依赖关系。因此，在社会生活一切方面，做为思想和政治领导力量的党，必须从技术管理的实际措施方面，从教育、政治和世界观方面，把加速国民经济中的技术进步问题提到日程上来。
    整个社会主义阵营在经济、科学和技术进步方面所取得的成就，包括物质方面和人的方面。物质方面是：在社会主义制度条件下，生产力的发展有无限的可能性。人的方面是：培养全面发展的、服务于社会主义制度的新人。在社会主义建设中，人这方面起着极其特殊的重要作用。
    波兰在这两方面是怎样处理的呢？在物质方面，在工业方面已取得巨大的成就，在人民政权存在的十五年中，工业生产提高了四倍半。另一方面，我们也培养了大量技术干部。“物质方面”的成就伴随着我们制度的“人的方面”的发展而发展。工人阶级人数增长了，劳动知识分子的队伍扩大了。同时在社会上也发生了深刻的质的变化。社会主义思想深入人心。党和群众的关系密切了。同时，也感到某些还未克服的、在社会主义建设过程中“人的方面”的弱点。这些弱点表现在世界观、思想意识和政治以及专业的熟练程度方面。我们从旧制度继承下来的、还未消除的在思想方法上、习惯上和文化上的落后部分，障碍着我们的发展。在人们的思想中的资本主义残余，各种小资产阶级和贵族的传统习惯，障碍着我们的发展。因此，今天我们必须进行积极的思想政治工作，加强对群众的社会主义世界观教育。没有这种教育，技术基地、技术投资、改革劳动工具问题也不易解决，也不能利用社会主义生产关系以及已有的技术基地所提供的加速发展的一切可能性。这个问题不仅波兰注意，就是在建设社会主义高级阶段的苏联，也把提高劳动人民觉悟视为顺利实现共产主义建设纲领的基本条件。
    思想教育的新攻势的内容，是为技术进步和提高群众社会主义觉悟而奋斗。技术进步同生产过程中正确的技术定额分不开，它也同适当的工作定额分不开。正确的技术定额不只是提高劳动生产率的杠杆，也是确定新道德标准、对工作新态度的工具。因此，任何时候也不能忽视“各尽所能，按劳分配”的社会主义原则。常有这种情况，技术低的人比技术高的人得的工资多，这是违反道德原则的。没有正确的工作技术定额，就不会建立社会主义的工作道德标准。
    人民军队是现代技术的使用者，因此我们第一个基本方向是不断提高技术兵器的使用水平，巧妙地节约地维护装备，开展发明创造运动。军队是新技术的大量使用者，同时又是培养技术青年的学校。千万青年通过服兵役接触各种各样的复杂技术，学到技术，然后转到国民经济中去，成为提高整个社会文化的因素。这就是我们工作的第二个基本方向。
    党组织当前的任务，是通过讨论使全体战士了解这个基本真理。技术进步的中心是人，在社会主义社会，技术进步为人服务，改善人的工作和生活条件，而人决定技术发展。因此，最重要的是作人的工作，培养人对技术的正确态度。
