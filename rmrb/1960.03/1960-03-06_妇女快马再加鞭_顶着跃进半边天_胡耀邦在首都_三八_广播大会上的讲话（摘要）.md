Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a speech entitled "Women Whip the Horse and Add the Spur, Supporting Half the Sky in the Great Leap Forward" at the radio rally celebrating achievements, commending models, welcoming "March 8th," and holding high the red flag to leap forward together. The following is a summary:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, I extend the warmest congratulations to all women comrades across the country who have made tremendous contributions to the great cause of socialism in the motherland, especially to the ten thousand comrades who have made outstanding contributions and have been honorably awarded the titles of "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives!

Since the founding of New China, especially since the Great Leap Forward, Chinese women have resolutely responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, establishing great ambitions, setting lofty goals, boosting morale, striving for advancement, and throwing themselves into the vigorous socialist great competition, advancing shoulder to shoulder with male comrades. The heroic labor of women of all ethnic groups in China on all fronts has not only fundamentally changed the social status of women in China, but also powerfully promoted the high-speed development of the socialist cause. Chinese women have proven with practical actions what Chairman Mao said: Chinese women are a great human resource. Chinese women have demonstrated with glorious facts that they are a great force loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the General Line.

Some people say that women's strength is boundless, supporting half the sky of production. In my opinion, this estimate is still too small. It should be said that the strength of Chinese women is boundless, supporting half the sky of the entire great cause. For such women, for such female comrades, the youth of our country, our teenagers, our children, and our future generations will always remember them and respect them.

The reason why Chinese women are able to make great contributions to the motherland is first and foremost because they resolutely listen to the Party and implement political leadership. Now, what Chinese women care about is the great future of the motherland. They share the same breath and destiny with the entire people, and closely link their own liberation with the great ideal of communism. It is precisely because of this consciousness that thousands upon thousands of female comrades in our country have established a communist attitude towards labor. Wherever the Party points, they rush there, doing both light and heavy work, dirty and tiring work, working without conditions, laboring without compensation, gladly leaving difficulties to themselves and making things convenient for others, stepping forward when facing difficulties, giving way when facing honor, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that female members of the Communist Youth League and young people will learn this great communist spirit, promote this great communist spirit, and contribute their greatest strength to the great cause of the motherland.

The reason why Chinese women are able to make great contributions to the motherland is because they actively support the People's Communes and love the People's Communes. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution enabled Chinese women to achieve a great political liberation. And the establishment of the People's Communes has enabled Chinese women to embark on the road of complete liberation.

The People's Communes have liberated women on a large scale from trivial housework for the first time in history, realizing the socialization of housework. This is a great liberation of the productive forces and a sprout of communism. Now, we are faced with two kinds of labor: one is socialist productive labor, and the other is socialist service labor. Service labor serves both the lives of the masses and the production of society. Doing a good job in service labor can powerfully promote the development of the entire production cause. At present, this labor is mainly undertaken by women. Therefore, Chinese women shoulder two glorious tasks: productive labor and service labor. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that all female members of the Communist Youth League and young people will love both productive labor and service labor. We must run nurseries well, run kindergartens well, run public canteens well, run laundry rooms and sewing groups well, and run all collective welfare undertakings well. You must learn in your work, improve in your work, and strive to cultivate yourselves into red and expert specialists in these industries.

The reason why Chinese women are able to make great contributions to the motherland is also due to their constant striving for progress. Learning politics, learning technology, and learning culture, they dare to compete with male comrades in production, and they also dare to compete with male comrades in learning. The deeds of countless advanced female comrades show that the better they learn, the less inferiority they feel, the greater their skills become, and the higher their aspirations rise.

The cause our people are now engaged in is an unprecedentedly great cause. We must not only modernize industry and agriculture, but also modernize science and technology. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that female members of the Communist Youth League and young people will, in accordance with the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, actively participate in the vigorously developing mass technological innovation movement, strive to master advanced experience, strive to master science and technology, strive to improve their cultural level, and have the determination and ambition to cultivate themselves into a new generation that is both red and expert.

Dear comrades! At this Great Leap Forward mobilization rally, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, called on you to whip the horse and add the spur. What does "whip the horse and add the spur" mean? It means that in the new year, you will surely support half the sky of the Great Leap Forward. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, I congratulate you, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, whip the horse and add the spur again and again, leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again!

    妇女快马再加鞭　顶着跃进半边天
    胡耀邦在首都“三八”广播大会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社5日讯　共青团中央书记处第一书记胡耀邦在庆功表模迎“三八”、高举红旗齐跃进的广播大会上作了题为：“妇女快马再加鞭，顶着跃进半边天”的讲话，摘要如下：
    我代表共青团中央，向为祖国社会主义的伟大事业作出了巨大贡献的全国妇女同志，特别是向一万个作出突出贡献、因而光荣地被奖为“三八”红旗手和“三八”红旗集体的同志们，表示最热烈的祝贺！
    新中国成立以来，特别是大跃进以来，我国妇女坚决响应党和毛主席的号召，树雄心，立大志，鼓干劲，争上游，投入了轰轰烈烈的社会主义大竞赛，同男同志并肩前进。我国各族妇女在各个战线上的英勇劳动，不但根本改变了我国妇女的社会地位，而且有力地促进着社会主义事业高速度地向前发展。我国妇女用实际的行动证明了毛主席所说的：中国妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。我国妇女用光辉的事实表明自己是忠于祖国，忠于人民，忠于总路线的一支伟大的力量。
    有人说，妇女力量大无边，顶着生产半个天。在我看来，这个估计还小了。应该说，我国妇女力量大无边，顶着整个伟大事业的半边天。对于这样的女性，对于这样的女同志，我国青年，我国少年，我国儿童，我们的后代子孙，将永远记住她们，尊敬她们。
    我国妇女所以能够为祖国做出伟大的贡献，首先是由于坚决听党的话，实行政治挂帅的结果。现在，我国妇女关心的是祖国的伟大前途。她们和全体人民同呼吸，共命运，把自身的解放同共产主义的伟大理想紧紧地联结了起来。正是因为有了这种觉悟，我国千千万万的女同志，树立了共产主义的劳动态度，党指向哪里，就奔到那里，轻活也干，重活也干，脏活也干，累活也干，工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，乐于把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见落后就帮。共青团中央希望女共青团员和青年，学习这种伟大的共产主义精神，发扬这种伟大的共产主义精神，为祖国的伟大事业贡献出自己的最大力量。
    我国妇女所以能够为祖国做出伟大的贡献，是由于积极拥护人民公社，热爱人民公社的结果。我国人民革命的伟大胜利，使我国妇女得到了政治上的大翻身。而人民公社的建立，又使我国妇女走上了彻底解放的道路。
    人民公社使妇女在历史上第一次大规模地从琐碎家务中解放出来，实现家务劳动社会化。这是生产力的大解放，是共产主义的萌芽。现在，在我们面前有两种性质的劳动：一种是社会主义的生产性劳动，一种是社会主义的服务性劳动。服务性的劳动既为群众的生活服务，又为社会的生产服务。把服务性劳动搞好，就能够有力地促进整个生产事业的发展。目前，这种劳动主要是由妇女担当的。因此，我国妇女肩负着生产性劳动和服务性劳动这样两重光荣的任务。共青团中央希望全体女共青团员和青年，既要热爱生产性劳动，也要热爱服务性劳动。一定要把托儿所办好，把幼儿园办好，把公共食堂办好，把洗衣房和缝纫组办好，把一切集体福利事业通统办好。你们要在工作中学习，在工作中提高，努力培养自己成为这些行业的红色专家。
    我国妇女所以能够为祖国做出伟大的贡献，还由于不断求上进的结果。学政治，学技术，学文化，在生产上敢于同男同志比，在学习上也敢于和男同志比。无数的先进妇女同志的事迹表明，她们越是学得好，她们的自卑感就越少，她们的本领就越大，她们的志气就越高。
    我国人民现在所从事的事业，是空前伟大的事业。我们不仅要使工业、农业现代化，而且要使科学技术也现代化。共青团中央希望女共青团员和青年，按照党和毛主席的教导，积极参加蓬勃发展的全民的技术革新运动，努力掌握先进经验，努力掌握科学技术，努力提高文化水平，有决心有志气把自己培养成为又红又专的新一代。
    亲爱的同志们！在这个大跃进的誓师大会上，全国妇联主席蔡畅同志号召你们快马再加鞭。快马再加鞭是什么意思呢？这就是你们在新的一年里，一定能够顶着跃进的半边天。我代表共青团中央祝贺你们，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，快马加鞭再加鞭，跃进，跃进，再跃进！
