Xinhua News Agency, March 19th - More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Cuban people and the Latin American people. The conference issued a strong voice: The Chinese people will always stand with the Cuban people and Latin American people! The struggle of the Latin American people is the struggle of the Chinese people; the victory of the Latin American people is the victory of the Chinese people!

Today's rally was held by the people of the capital in response to the "Week of Support for the Latin American People," to support the Latin American people and to celebrate the establishment of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association. This grand gathering marks the closer unity of the 650 million Chinese people and the 200 million Latin American people in the struggle against the common enemy, advancing side by side.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the conference. When they, accompanied by Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, and Latin American guests in Beijing, stepped onto the rostrum, the audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.

Today's conference was unprecedentedly grand. In front of the curtain in the center of the rostrum, the flags of various Latin American countries were lined up. Flowers bloomed in front of the rostrum. More than 10,000 people gathered together. Huge banners were hung on the tall second and third floors of the hall: "Long Live the Friendship and Unity of the Chinese and Latin American People!" "Resolutely Support the National Democratic Movement of Latin American Countries!" "Resolutely Support the Cuban People's Struggle Against US Imperialist Aggression!"

Chu Tunan: The Chinese People Invariably Stand with the Cuban and Latin American People, and Resolutely Support Their Just Struggle

Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, delivered the opening remarks. On behalf of today's conference, he extended warm fraternal respect to the Latin American people, especially the heroic Cuban people, who are fighting against US imperialist aggression, defending national independence, and striving for people's democracy.

Chu Tunan said that in recent years, the national and democratic movements in Latin America have been surging, and the struggle of the Latin American people against US imperialist oppression and plunder has achieved a series of victories. The "backyard" that US imperialism has always considered is turning into a front line for the struggle against US imperialism.

He said that US imperialism is extremely hostile to the victories of the Latin American people, especially the Cuban people, and it is trying every means to undermine the revolutionary achievements of the Cuban people. However, the threats and sabotage of US imperialism have not frightened the Cuban people and the Latin American people in the slightest. On the contrary, they have intensified their struggle against US imperialism and further strengthened their unity.

He said that the Chinese people warmly respond to the "Week of Support for the Latin American People" initiated by 66 parties and organizations in Latin America. The Chinese people invariably stand with the Cuban and Latin American people, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban and Latin American people.

He said that there is a traditional friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries. Especially in the past ten years, many outstanding representatives of the people of Latin American countries, representative figures from all walks of life, and art troupes have visited or performed in our country. Representative delegations from our country's cultural, artistic, trade union, youth, and women's circles have also visited or performed in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and other countries. Our country's culture and art have a wide range of enthusiasts in Latin America. The progressive literature, art, music, dance, film, and drama of Latin American countries are also appreciated by the broad masses of the Chinese people. In the past decade, friends from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, and eleven other countries have successively initiated the establishment of friendship organizations for our country. The friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries is developing day by day. The Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association was officially established on March 16, and a president, vice presidents, directors, and executive directors were elected, and a working body was established.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association will make its greatest efforts to further support the struggle of the Latin American people and enhance the friendly unity and cultural and economic exchanges between the two peoples.

Guo Moruo: The Chinese People and the Latin American People Closely Join Hands and Advance Side by Side in the Struggle Against US Imperialism and for the Defense of World Peace

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, delivered an important speech at the conference. He said that the establishment of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association on the eve of the "Week of Support for the Latin American People" not only fully demonstrates the Chinese people's firm support for the Latin American people, but also shows that the 650 million Chinese people and the 200 million Latin American people will join hands more closely and advance side by side in the common struggle against American imperialism and for the defense of world peace.

Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Latin American people as their own struggle, and their victory as their own victory. As early as in the battle of the Latin American people against the Spanish colonists, Chinese immigrants formed a noble friendship with the Latin American people with their own blood. The enemy of the Chinese people and the enemy of the Latin American people is the same imperialism. The culprits who occupy our country's territory of Taiwan and bomb Cuban sugarcane fields come from the same place. In order to oppose the common enemy, the Chinese people will always stand with the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries, and resolutely support their just struggle.

Guo Moruo's speech was extremely warmly welcomed. When he finally said, "The storm of national democratic revolution has arrived, and a new and free Latin America is about to be born. Let us warmly cheer for it," the audience was active, and the applause lasted for a long time.

Li Jiebo: In the Struggle Against the Common Enemy—US Imperialism—and for the Defense of World Peace, the Friendship Between the Chinese and Latin American People Will Be Increasingly Strengthened

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of the people's organizations in the capital. He said that the establishment of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association is an important milestone in the history of Chinese-Latin American friendship. It marks the great development of the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries. The friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people, which has developed rapidly in the struggle against the common enemy—US imperialism—and for the defense of world peace, will be increasingly strengthened and consolidated.

He said that the Chinese people have suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time in the past. This painful experience makes the Chinese people feel particularly sympathetic to the oppression suffered by the Latin American people. They are particularly excited about the struggles and victories that the Latin American people are carrying out today. We deeply feel that the struggle of the Latin American people is also the struggle of our Chinese people, and the victory of the Latin American people is also the victory of our Chinese people. The Chinese people will always stand with the Latin American people and fight against the common enemy—US imperialism.

Deng Gang: The Cuban People's Struggle Is Not Isolated; the People of the World Are Watching Revolutionary Cuba

Deng Gang, Deputy Director of Xinhua News Agency and Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Journalists Association, visited Cuba in January this year. He introduced the vigorous revolutionary movement in Cuba at the conference. He said that as soon as we arrived in Havana, the capital of Cuba, we were immediately attracted by the boiling struggle life. In the year of victory, the new revolutionary regime is advancing rapidly with firm confidence, guiding the Cuban people along the road of independence, freedom, progress, and prosperity. The revolution is deeper and stronger than ever before.

Deng Gang said that the Cuban revolution is a people's revolution. It is the people themselves who rose up and won the victory of the revolution through armed struggle. Now the revolutionary government of Cuba is the first government in Cuban history that does not obey imperialism but serves the people. It relies on the people and is loved by the people.

Deng Gang said that the Cuban people's struggle is not isolated. The people of the world are watching revolutionary Cuba. The Cuban people clearly feel this. They answered every person who supports the Cuban revolution with sincere friendship. We met many Cuban workers, farmers, shop assistants, and intellectuals during this visit. They warmly welcomed us and embraced us. In Cuba, many people have read Chairman Mao's works and articles by other leading comrades in our country. They said that the victory of the Chinese revolution is encouraging the Cuban revolution. We sincerely wish the Cuban revolution to forge ahead in this new era and achieve new and greater victories.

Vibas: Thank You to the Chinese People and Government for Their Sincere Sympathy and Support for Cuba

Five Latin American guests delivered enthusiastic speeches at the conference. When I. Vibas, a representative of the Cuban University Students Federation, was invited to the stage to speak, the audience applauded warmly for several minutes. Vibas said that on behalf of the Cuban people and Cuban university students, he would like to express his most heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and government for their sincere sympathy for the Cuban revolution at this difficult and great moment of the Cuban people's revolution, and for their firm attitude towards the Wall Street imperialism's aggression and attack on the Cuban people and the revolution.

Vibas said: We are extremely pleased to congratulate the realization of this great initiative to establish the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, and will do our best to help consolidate this association. The establishment of this association is the result of the natural historical development of the anti-imperialist struggle of our two peoples who have been plundered by international interest groups.

After listing the US imperialist plunder and interference in Cuba, he said, let the people of the world know, and let the US imperialism remember: The Cuban revolution will never retreat even one millimeter, and will not give in to the enemy even one step. On the contrary, each new aggression will only make us more determined and more thorough, and promulgate more revolutionary decrees. Moreover, in order to defend the revolution, we have mobilized the masses of the people, organized militias, and armed farmers, workers, university students, and intellectuals. In addition, the people of the world firmly support us, just as the Chinese people are doing now.

Vibas finally shouted, "Long live the Cuban revolution!" "Long live the glorious Chinese people!" After his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with him warmly, and the audience erupted in stormy applause.

Boero: We Will Jointly Build the Bridge of Friendship Between Our Peoples

Gil E. Boero, Chairman of the Argentine University Students Federation, then spoke. He said that we are extremely excited because we know that we will jointly build the bridge of friendship between our peoples. Just as imperialism is threatening the Cuban people's revolution—which is the revolution of the entire Latin American people—650 million free men and women have expressed their willingness to firmly establish the organizational form of the sentiments of friendship that connect our people. Today, this unforgettable day of laying the foundation for our friendship is also the day that marks another defeat for imperialism. Our people, through us here, demonstrate their solidarity and friendship in the struggle to defend national sovereignty and oppose imperialism. Boero said that soon we will cross land and sea to return to our motherland, and we will tell the people the great spirit of this conference, which is a symbol of the friendly feelings of the workers and intellectuals of your great country.

Mrs. Konitzer: We Will Return to Our Country with Confidence, Carrying the Truth of the Chinese People

Mrs. Ya. Be. de Konitzer, head of the Bolivian women's delegation visiting China, spoke. She said that today we have personally come to this Chinese land and seen its great construction. The Chinese people are building tall buildings, opening schools, building roads, establishing factories, opening up new production resources, and taming nature to benefit the people. How can people not hope that these constructions will last forever? How can people not hope that future generations will live in a better world?

She said that on the occasion of the establishment of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, we first congratulate this wonderful initiative. In Bolivia, some well-known people who have visited China have also begun to do the same work. We know that it is difficult to overcome prejudice and lies. But we think it must be overcome. We will return to our country with this confidence, carrying the truth of the Chinese people.

Estrella: The Relationship Between the Chinese People and the Latin American People Has Entered a New Stage

Brazilian famous pianist A. Estrella spoke. He said that today marks a step forward in the relationship between the Chinese people and the Latin American people and has entered a new stage.

He said that for the Brazilian people, there is only one China, and its legitimate representative is the government born in the revolution, which liberated this great country from imperialist exploitation. We Brazilians all know that Taiwan is a part of China, although it is temporarily occupied by US imperialism.

He said that we are now and will be friends in the future. We hope that all people will achieve economic independence and progress. We hope that all the people of the world will be liberated from political enslavement and economic exploitation. We want peace; the people are not interested in war. The people who have mastered their own destiny will be able to stop the war, and the people who are fighting for their own liberation will stand with you to defend peace together.

Vanturelli: The Friendship That the Chinese People Expressed to the Latin American People Will Penetrate Deeply into the Hearts of All Americans

Jose Vanturelli, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Council and a famous Chilean painter, spoke. He said that it is a matter of profound significance for the Chinese people to express friendship and support to the people of Latin American countries. It will penetrate deeply into the hearts of all the American people who are striving for independence, defending national sovereignty, and striving for peace.

He said that when the Latin American people shake the hand extended by the Chinese people from the Pacific Ocean, we know that this is not only the greetings of 800 million people to each other, but also means the establishment of fraternal and unbreakable ties. For the cause of our peoples uniting to fight against imperialism together, the largest and deepest ocean is not enough to become an obstacle.

Vanturelli said that the friendship and support that the Chinese people have expressed to Latin America this week, and the establishment of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, will further develop the friendly relations between the Chinese and Latin American people. The struggle we face is arduous, but seeing that we have so many and such good friends, our strength is growing stronger and stronger, our confidence is becoming more and more firm, and the final victory must belong to the Latin American people.

All the speeches of the guests and hosts at the conference were warmly welcomed. During their speeches, stormy applause constantly resounded in the Great Hall of the People.

The conference finally adopted the telegram from the conference to friendly groups in Latin American countries to our country. When the telegram was read out, another thunderous applause rang out throughout the venue.

Friendly organizations and famous people from Cuba, Panama, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Spain, Chile, and other countries sent telegrams to congratulate the establishment of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association. When these congratulatory telegrams were read out at the conference, the audience applauded warmly, expressing their welcome.

At the conference, the Vice Chairman of the National Student Union of Brazil, Meireles, presented the Brazilian flag and national anthem to the conference, which was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Today, Latin American guests in Beijing and guests in Beijing from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, India, Japan, Cyprus, and other countries were invited to attend the conference.

    民族民主革命风暴已经到来，新的自由的拉丁美洲就要诞生
    中国支持古巴和拉丁美洲正义斗争
    首都万人集会响应“支援拉丁美洲人民周”和庆祝中国拉丁美洲友好协会成立
    周恩来总理等出席大会，楚图南、郭沫若等和拉丁美洲来宾都相继讲话
    据新华社19日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午在人民大会堂举行盛大集会，坚决支持古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的正义斗争。大会上发出强烈的声音：中国人民永远同古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民站在一起！拉丁美洲人民的斗争就是中国人民的斗争，拉丁美洲人民的胜利就是中国人民的胜利！
    今天的大会，是首都人民为响应“支援拉丁美洲人民周”，为支援拉丁美洲人民及庆祝中国拉丁美洲友好协会的成立而举行的。这次盛大的集会，标志着六亿五千万中国人民和两亿拉丁美洲人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中，更加紧密地团结起来，携手并肩前进。
    周恩来总理、彭真副委员长和陈毅副总理等出席了大会。当他们由中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南等陪同和在京的拉丁美洲各国来宾一起登上主席台的时候，全场起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌。
    今天的大会盛况空前。在主席台正中帷幕前面，排满了拉丁美洲各个国家的国旗。主席台前鲜花盛开。一万多人济济一堂。大厅里高大的二层楼和三层楼上，挂着巨幅的大字标语：“中国和拉丁美洲各国人民的友谊和团结万岁！”“坚决支持拉丁美洲各国的民族民主运动！”“坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争！”
    楚图南：中国人民始终不渝地同古巴和拉丁美洲人民站在一起，坚决支持他们的正义斗争
    中国人民对外文化协会会长、中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南首先致开会词。他代表今天的大会向反对美帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立、争取人民民主的拉丁美洲人民——特别是英雄的古巴人民致以热烈的兄弟般的敬意。
    楚图南说，近年来，拉丁美洲的民族、民主运动汹涌澎湃，拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义压迫和掠夺的斗争，取得了一系列的胜利。美帝国主义一向认为的“后院”正在变成反对美帝国主义斗争的前线。
    他说，美帝国主义对于拉丁美洲各国人民，特别是古巴人民的胜利极为仇视，它千方百计地企图破坏古巴人民的革命成果。但是美帝国主义的威胁和破坏，丝毫没有吓倒古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民，相反地使他们反对美帝国主义的斗争更加高涨，使他们的团结进一步加强。
    他说，中国人民热烈响应拉丁美洲六十六个党派和团体发起的“支援拉丁美洲人民周”。中国人民始终不渝地同古巴和拉丁美洲人民站在一起，坚决支持古巴和拉丁美洲人民的正义斗争。
    他说，中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民之间，有着传统的友谊。特别是十年以来，有很多拉丁美洲国家人民的优秀代表，社会各阶层有代表性的人士和艺术团体，到我国进行了访问或演出。我国的文化、艺术、工会、青年和妇女等各界代表团也曾先后到过阿根廷、巴西、智利、乌拉圭、玻利维亚、墨西哥、委内瑞拉、古巴等国访问或演出。我国的文化、艺术在拉丁美洲拥有广大的爱好者。拉丁美洲国家进步的文学、艺术、音乐、舞蹈、电影、戏剧等也为广大的中国人民所欣赏。近十年来，阿根廷、巴西、智利、墨西哥、委内瑞拉等十一个国家的朋友先后发起成立了对我国的友好组织。中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民之间的友谊日益发展，中国拉丁美洲友好协会已在3月16日正式成立，选出了会长、副会长，选出了理事和常务理事，建立了工作机构。
    楚图南说，中国拉丁美洲友好协会今后将为进一步支援拉丁美洲人民的斗争，增进双方人民之间的友好团结和文化经济交流作出最大的努力。
    郭沫若：中国人民和拉丁美洲人民在反对美帝国主义和保卫世界和平斗争中紧密携手并肩前进
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在会上作了重要讲话。他说，中国拉丁美洲友好协会在“支援拉丁美洲人民周”的前夕宣布成立，这不仅充分表示着中国人民对拉丁美洲人民的坚决支援，而且说明着六亿五千万中国人民和两亿拉丁美洲人民在反对美国帝国主义和保卫世界和平的共同斗争中将更加紧密地携起手来，并肩前进。
    郭沫若说，中国人民从来就把拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争看成是
  自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看成是自己的胜利。远在拉丁美洲人民抗击西班牙殖民者的战斗中，中国侨民就用自己的鲜血同拉丁美洲人民结成了崇高的友谊。中国人民的敌人和拉丁美洲人民的敌人是同一个帝国主义，霸占我国的领土台湾和轰炸古巴蔗田的凶手都来自同一个地方。为了反对共同的敌人，中国人民将永远站在古巴人民和拉丁美洲各国人民一边，坚决支持他们的正义斗争。
    郭沫若的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。当他最后说到“民族民主革命的风暴已经到来了，一个新的自由的拉丁美洲就要诞生，让我们为它热烈地欢呼”的时候，全场活跃，掌声经久不息。
    李颉伯：在反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中，中国和拉丁美洲人民的友谊将日益加强
    中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯代表首都各人民团体讲话。他说，中国拉丁美洲友协的成立，是中国拉丁美洲友谊史上的重要里程碑，它标志着中国和拉丁美洲各国人民间的友谊的大发展。中国和拉丁美洲各国人民在反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中所迅速发展起来的友谊，将日益加强和巩固。
    他说，中国人民过去曾长期遭受帝国主义的侵略和压迫，这种痛苦经验，使中国人民对拉丁美洲人民所受的压迫，特别感到兄弟般的同情，对于拉丁美洲各国人民今天所进行的斗争和业已取得的胜利格外感到兴奋。我们深深感到：拉丁美洲人民的斗争也是我们中国人民的斗争，拉丁美洲人民的胜利，也是我们中国人民的胜利。中国人民将永远同拉丁美洲人民站在一起，为反对共同敌人——美帝国主义而斗争。
    邓　岗：古巴人民的斗争不是孤立的，全世界人民都注视着革命的古巴
    新华通讯社副社长、中国新闻工作者协会书记处书记邓岗在今年1月访问了古巴，他在会上介绍了古巴蓬蓬勃勃的革命运动的情况。他说，当我们一到古巴的首都哈瓦那，就立即为那种沸腾的斗争生活所吸引。新的革命政权，在胜利的一年里，正以坚定的信心，迈开巨大的步伐，指引古巴人民沿着独立、自由、进步和繁荣的大道疾进。革命比过去任何时候都更加深入和强大。
    邓岗说，古巴的革命是人民的革命，是人民自己起来，用武装斗争赢得革命的胜利的。现在古巴的革命政府，是古巴历史上第一个不听命于帝国主义而为人民服务的政府，它依赖人民，也就为人民所爱戴。
    邓岗说，古巴人民的斗争不是孤立的，全世界人民都注视着革命的古巴。古巴人民清楚地感到这一点。他们用真诚的友情回答每一个支持古巴革命的人。我们这次访问中接触到了许多古巴的工人、农民、店员和知识分子，他们热情地欢迎我们，拥抱我们。在古巴，有许多人读过毛主席的著作和我国其他领导同志的文章，他们说中国革命的胜利正在鼓舞着古巴的革命。我们衷心地祝愿古巴的革命在这个新的时代里，勇往直前，取得新的更大的胜利。
    维巴斯：感谢中国人民和政府对古巴的真诚同情和支持
    有五位拉丁美洲的来宾在会上发表了热烈的讲话。古巴大学生联合会代表依·维巴斯应邀登台讲话时，全场热烈鼓掌达数分钟之久。维巴斯说，他首先代表古巴人民和古巴的大学生，向中国人民和政府在这古巴人民革命处于艰难而伟大的时刻所表示的对古巴革命真诚的同情和对华尔街帝国主义对古巴人民和革命的侵略和进攻的坚决的态度，表示最衷心的感谢。
    维巴斯说：我们极高兴地祝贺建立中国拉丁美洲友好协会这个伟大倡议实现，并将尽我们全部的力量来帮助这个协会的巩固。这个协会的成立是遭受国际利益集团的掠夺的我们两国人民进行反帝斗争的自然的历史的发展的结果。
    他在列举了美帝国主义对古巴的掠夺和干涉后说，让全世界人民知道，让美帝国主义记住：古巴革命决不后退一毫米，对敌人一步也不退让，相反，每次新的侵略只会使我们更坚决，更彻底，颁布更多的革命法令。并且，为了保卫革命，我们动员了人民群众，组织了民兵，武装了农民、工人、大学生和知识分子。此外，全世界人民坚决的支持我们，正像现在中国人民所做的那样。
    维巴斯最后高呼“古巴革命万岁！”“光荣的中国人民万岁！”他讲话以后，周恩来总理同他热烈地握手，全场这时爆发起暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    博埃罗：我们将共同建造我们人民之间的友谊的大桥
    阿根廷大学生联合会主席吉·埃·博埃罗接着讲话。他说，我们心中异常兴奋，因为我们知道我们将共同建造我们人民之间的友谊的大桥。正当帝国主义对古巴人民的革命——这是整个拉丁美洲人民的革命——进行威胁的时候，六亿五千万自由的男女表达了他们愿把联系我们人民的友谊的情感的组织形式牢结起来的愿望。今天，这奠定我们友谊的难忘的日子，也是标志帝国主义又一次失败的日子。我们的人民通过我们在这里表明他们在保卫国家主权和反对帝国主义的斗争中的团结和友谊。博埃罗说，不久我们就要跨过陆地和海洋回到我们的祖国去，我们将把这次大会的伟大精神告诉给人民，这次大会是你们这个伟大国家的劳动者和知识分子的友好感情的象征。
    科尼策夫人：我们将怀着信心，带着中国人民的真理回到我们的国家去
    玻利维亚访华妇女代表团团长亚·贝·德·科尼策夫人讲话。她说，今天我们亲临这块中国土地，看到了它的伟大建设。中国人民在建造高楼大厦、开办学校、铺设公路、创办工厂、开辟新的生产资源、驯服大自然使之造福人民。人们怎能不希望这些建设持久永存，人们怎能不希望将来的世世代代生活在更好的世界中。
    她说，当此成立中国拉丁美洲友好协会之际，我们首先祝贺这一美好的创举。在玻利维亚，一些访问过中国的知名人士也已经开始进行同样的工作。我们知道，要战胜偏见及谎言是困难的。但是我们认为必须战胜它。我们将怀着这种信心，带着中国人民的真理回到我们的国家去。
    埃斯特雷拉：中国人民和拉丁美洲人民之间的关系进入了一个新的阶段
    巴西著名钢琴家阿·埃斯特雷拉讲话。他说，今天这个日子标志着中国人民和拉丁美洲人民之间的关系向前迈进了一步，并进入了一个新的阶段。
    他说，对巴西人民说来只存在一个中国，它的合法代表就是在革命中诞生的政府，这个革命使这一伟大国家从帝国主义的剥削下解放了出来。我们巴西人都知道台湾是中国的一部分，尽管暂时还被美帝国主义侵占着。
    他说，我们现在是，将来也是朋友。我们希望所有的人民都获得经济独立和进步。我们希望全世界人民都从政治奴役和经济剥削中解放出来。我们要和平，人民对战争是不感兴趣的。掌握了自己命运的人民将能制止战争，为了自己的解放而进行斗争的人民将和你们站在一起共同捍卫和平。
    万徒勒里：中国人民向拉丁美洲人民表示的友谊，将深入到整个美洲人的内心里
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平理事会副秘书长、智利名画家何塞·万徒勒里讲话。他说，中国人民向拉丁美洲各国人民表达友谊和支援是一件具有深刻意义的事情。它将深入到争取独立、保卫民族主权和争取和平的整个美洲人民的内心里去。
    他说，拉丁美洲人民握着中国人民从太平洋伸过来的手的时候，我们知道，这不仅是八亿人民在互相问候，而且也是意味着建立兄弟般和牢不可破的纽带。对于我们各国人民团结一致为反对帝国主义而共同斗争的事业说来，最大最深的海洋不足以成为障碍。
    万徒勒里说，中国人民在这一周中对拉丁美洲表示的友谊和支持，中国拉丁美洲友好协会的成立，将进一步发展中国和拉丁美洲各国人民的友好关系。我们面临的斗争是艰巨的，但是看到我们有这么多、这么好的朋友，我们的力量愈来愈强大，我们的信心越来越坚定，最后胜利一定属于拉丁美洲人民。
    宾主在大会上的所有讲话，都受到了热烈的欢迎，在他们讲话的过程中，万人大会堂里不断响起暴风雨般的热烈的掌声。
