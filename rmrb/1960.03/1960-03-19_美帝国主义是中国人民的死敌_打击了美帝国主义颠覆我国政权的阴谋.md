    American Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of the Chinese People
    Crushing the American Imperialist Plot to Subvert Our Government
    Shanghai Intermediate People's Court Sentences American Spy Walter F. Cleary to Twenty Years Imprisonment According to Law
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 18th. The Shanghai Intermediate People's Court publicly tried American spy Walter F. Cleary, who had previously been arrested by us, and sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment according to law.
    American spy Walter F. Cleary committed the serious crimes of plotting to subvert our people's democratic government and personally directing the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique in counter-revolutionary activities. He was arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau on October 18, 1958, according to law. On March 18th of this year, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court held a public trial based on the indictment of the Shanghai People's Procuratorate Branch. More than one hundred people from all walks of life in Shanghai attended the hearing.
    The spy Walter F. Cleary is from Cumberland, Maryland, USA. He is a veteran American spy. In May 1948, Walter F. Cleary came to our country with the American imperialist element, Catholic Cardinal Spellman, to carry out conspiratorial activities. At that time, Spellman, notorious for engaging in subversive activities, maintained close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, using "speeches" and "prayers" to instigate anti-communism and encourage Chiang Kai-shek's "suppression of bandits" war; at the same time, under the guise of "inspecting church affairs," he collected secret intelligence about our liberated areas and actively planned "contingency" deployments. After Spellman left, Walter F. Cleary stayed in China and, together with the Roman Catholic Papal Nuncio to the Chiang gang, imperialist element, Antonio Riberi, organized a reactionary organization called the "Catholic Central Bureau," with Walter F. Cleary serving as Secretary-General, using this as cover for espionage activities.
    During his time in charge of the "Catholic Central Bureau," Walter F. Cleary organized and directed imperialist spies and counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the Catholic Church to carry out criminal activities aimed at subverting the people's democratic government in an organized and planned manner. Evidence presented during the trial proved that, in order to cooperate with American imperialism's aggression against our country, Walter F. Cleary actively engaged in espionage intelligence activities under the guise of religion. The heads of the "Huaming News Agency," Zhai Guanghua (American citizen), the "Labor Law Department," Tian Zhizhong, the assistant of the "Cultural Activities Department," Tian Wanglin, and committee member Hou Zhizheng, all imperialist spies and counter-revolutionary elements under the leadership and support of Walter F. Cleary, successively collected military and political intelligence for Walter F. Cleary. Later, Walter F. Cleary collected important classified intelligence about the construction of military airfields in our country, the number of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops in Korea, their equipment, combat, air defense measures, and our country's defense construction, through other imperialist spies and counter-revolutionary elements. The cipher codes, secret writing, and intelligence materials used by the criminals for counter-revolutionary activities were all displayed in court.
    Spy Walter F. Cleary also used the cloak of religion to personally lead and develop the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" within the Catholic Church, plotting to carry out subversive activities. As Secretary-General of the "Catholic Central Bureau," Walter F. Cleary led the command center of this reactionary organization, the "Legion of Mary Office," and recruited a group of counter-revolutionary elements and special agents in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and other places as the backbone of the "Legion of Mary." For example, Shen Duosen, the president of the "Legion of Mary Shanghai Branch," was a special agent of the Chiang bandit gang's "Military Intelligence Bureau Shanghai International Intelligence Station." According to the defendant's instructions, members of the "Legion of Mary" in various places also resisted registration several times, hindering and undermining the implementation of orders from the military control commissions in various places to ban the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary."
    Walter F. Cleary also used the "Catholic Central Bureau" as an activity center to frantically incite Catholics and clergy to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government, undermine the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Catholics, and undermine the revolutionary cause of our people. For example, in 1951, just as our people were rising up to Resist America, Aid Korea, the defendant colluded with the imperialist element Antonio Riberi to draft and issue a reactionary encyclical, forwarding reactionary instructions from the Roman Curia, instructing Gong Pinmei and bishops of dioceses in various places to sign a "letter of commitment" to resolutely oppose the Chinese People's Government, plotting to coordinate with American imperialism's aggression and the restoration of the Chiang bandit gang.
    Prior to the trial of the Walter F. Cleary case, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court tried the case of the Gong Pinmei-led counter-revolutionary traitorous clique. The outcome of the trial confirmed that this counter-revolutionary traitorous clique had acted upon a large number of reactionary orders and instructions issued by American spy Walter F. Cleary, and carried out a series of traitorous activities targeting various political movements in our country. All the crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique are part of the ironclad evidence of the crimes committed by American spy Walter F. Cleary. These criminal facts confirm that the defendant is an American imperialist spy who has consistently served American imperialism's aggressive policy, endangered the interests of the Chinese people, and engaged in activities to subvert the People's Republic of China, and has seriously violated the laws of the People's Republic of China. The solemn trial of the Walter F. Cleary spy case and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique case by the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court is a heavy blow to American imperialism's plot to subvert our people's democratic government.
    In court, Walter F. Cleary was unable to deny the numerous pieces of conclusive evidence of his crimes and confessed to them. The court emphasized during the trial that the Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently guaranteed freedom of religious belief, but will never allow imperialist spies to engage in criminal activities aimed at subverting our people's democratic government under the guise of religion, nor will it allow anyone to use religious activities to undermine our country's policies and laws.
    The Criminal Tribunal of the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court, based on the public prosecution of the procuratorial organs, listened to the defendant's statement and the defense of the defense counsel, reviewed the confessions of the relevant criminals and the testimony of witnesses, and finally announced the sentence of the defendant Walter F. Cleary to twenty years imprisonment.

    美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌
    打击了美帝国主义颠覆我国政权的阴谋
    上海中级人民法院依法判处美国间谍华理柱有期徒刑二十年
    新华社上海18日电　上海市中级人民法院公开审判了前已被我逮捕的美国间谍分子华理柱，并依法判处他有期徒刑二十年。
    美国间谍华理柱犯有图谋颠覆我国人民民主政权、亲自指挥龚品梅反革命叛国集团进行反革命活动的严重罪行，1958年10月18日被我上海市人民公安机关依法予以逮捕。今年3月18日，我上海市中级人民法院根据上海市人民检察院分院的起诉，开庭进行公开审判。出席旁听的，有上海市各界人士一百多人。
    间谍分子华理柱是美国玛利兰州康柏兰市人，他是一个老牌的美国间谍。1948年5月，华理柱随美帝国主义分子、天主教枢机主教史贝尔曼来我国进行阴谋活动。当时，以从事颠覆活动而臭名远扬的史贝尔曼，同蒋介石反动集团保持着密切联系，利用“演讲”、“祈祷”的活动，策动反共，鼓励蒋介石的“戡乱”战争；同时，还以“巡视教务”为名，搜集我解放区机密情报，积极策划“应变”部署。史贝尔曼去后，华理柱留在中国，同罗马教廷驻蒋帮“公使”、帝国主义分子黎培理，组织以“天主教中央局”为名的反动机构，华理柱充任秘书长，并以此为掩护进行间谍活动。
    华理柱在主持“天主教中央局”活动期间，组织和指挥了隐藏在天主教中的帝国主义间谍和反革命分子，有组织、有计划地进行颠覆人民民主政权的罪恶活动。审判中提出的种种证据证实，华理柱为了配合美帝国主义对我国的侵略，曾经以宗教为掩护，积极从事间谍情报活动。由华理柱领导和支持的“天主教中央局”下属的“华明通讯社”负责人翟光华（美国籍）、“劳工法律部”负责人田执中、“文化活动部”助理田望霖、委员侯之正等帝国主义间谍和反革命分子，先后为华理柱搜集军事、政治情报。以后华理柱又通过其他帝国主义间谍和反革命分子，搜集了我国修建军用机场，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜部队的人数、装备、作战、防空措施，我国的国防建设等重要机密情报。罪犯为进行反革命活动所使用的密码、密写信和情报资料等证物，都被陈列在法庭上。
    间谍分子华理柱还以宗教外衣做掩护，在天主教内亲自领导和发展反动组织“圣母军”，图谋进行颠覆活动。华理柱以“天主教中央局”秘书长的身份，领导这个反动组织的指挥中心“圣母军办公室”，并且在上海、南京、天津等地网罗了一批反革命分子和特务分子作为“圣母军”的骨干，其中如“圣母军上海分会”会长沈多森，就是蒋匪帮“军统局上海国际情报站”的特务。根据被告的指示，各地的“圣母军”分子还曾经数次抗拒登记，阻挠和破坏各地军管会取缔反动组织“圣母军”命令的实施。
    华理柱还以“天主教中央局”为活动中心，疯狂地煽动天主教徒和神职人员，反对共产党和人民政府，破坏抗美援朝运动和天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，破坏我国人民的革命事业。例如：在1951年，正当我国人民奋起抗美援朝之际，被告与帝国主义分子黎培理共谋起草发布反动通谕，转发罗马教廷的反动指示，指令龚品梅及各地教区主教订立坚决与中国人民政府为敌的“誓愿书”，图谋策应美帝国主义的侵略和蒋匪帮的复辟。
    这次在审判华理柱案件之前，上海市中级人民法院审判了以龚品梅为首的反革命叛国集团案。审判的结果证实，这个反革命叛国集团曾秉承美国间谍华理柱所发出的大量反动指令和指示，针对我国各项政治运动，进行了一系列的叛国活动。龚品梅反革命叛国集团的全部罪行，是美国间谍华理柱所犯罪行铁证的一部分。这些犯罪事实证实，被告是一个一贯服务于美帝国主义的侵略政策，危害中国人民利益，进行颠覆中华人民共和国活动的美国帝国主义间谍分子，已经严重地违犯了中华人民共和国的法律。上海市中级人民法院对华理柱间谍案和龚品梅反革命叛国集团案所进行的严正审判，是对美帝国主义颠覆我国人民民主政权阴谋的一次沉重打击。
    在法庭上，华理柱面对大量证据确凿的犯罪事实，无法抵赖，供认不讳。法庭在审判中强调指出，中华人民共和国政府一贯保障宗教信仰自由，但是决不容许帝国主义的间谍分子以宗教外衣为掩护，从事颠覆我国人民民主政权的罪恶活动，也决不容许任何人利用宗教活动，破坏我国的政策法令。
    上海市中级人民法院刑事审判庭根据检察机关的公诉，听取了被告的陈述和辩护人的辩护，又审查了有关案犯的口供和证人的证言，最后宣布判处被告华理柱有期徒刑二十年。
