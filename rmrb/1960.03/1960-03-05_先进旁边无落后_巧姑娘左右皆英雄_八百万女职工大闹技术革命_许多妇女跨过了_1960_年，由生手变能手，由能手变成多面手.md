Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: More than eight million female workers across the country have plunged into the surging red, diligent, thrifty, and skillful competition movement. Together with the vast numbers of male workers, they are making a big push in technical innovation and revolution, advancing towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of manual operations.

With the overall leap forward in the national economy, the ranks of female workers in our country have expanded rapidly, from more than three million in 1957 to more than eight million in 1959. In China's modern large-scale enterprises, about 30% of the processes are manual operations, and in street industries, about 70% are manual. Moreover, most of those distributed in manual operation departments are women. Therefore, mobilizing the vast numbers of female workers to participate in technical innovation and revolution is of great significance. At present, many female workers across the country have made significant contributions in this regard. They have shattered the self-abasement and dependence that the old society left to women for thousands of years, carried forward the communist style of seeking truth from facts and daring to think and act, boldly creating and innovating, and many outstanding figures have emerged.

In various places, many female workers have increased labor productivity hundreds of times through technical improvements, and they have already crossed 1960. Wei Fengying, a young female stamping worker at the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory, has held the red flag high for several years and has always been ahead of time, completing the production volume of the first five-year plan 434 days ahead of schedule. In 1959, she changed a set of stamping dies from manual to mechanized operation, increasing work efficiency by 100 times. According to the current quota plan, she is already working on the tasks for 1969. Ma Lizhen, a female lathe operator at the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory in Shandong, successfully manufactured a semi-automatic meteor thread rolling machine on New Year's Day this year, increasing production efficiency by 359 times compared to the original, and had already stepped into 1965 in early January. Shortly after, Ma Lizhen transformed the thread rolling machine from semi-automatic to automatic, increasing production efficiency by more than 700 times. In addition, she also successfully trial-produced a special tool for processing steel plate washers of different specifications, the "multi-head punch," increasing processing efficiency by 179 times, and the quality is very good. Liu Yajun, a lathe operator in the component workshop of the Changxindian Communication Factory, completed six innovation projects this year, improved several kinds of tools and processing methods, and is now engaged in the production of 1963.

The participation of female workers in technical innovation has also developed from a small number of people in the past to a broad mass movement. Before Chongqing launched the "Skillful Girls" movement in 1959, only 10% of female workers participated in technical innovation and revolution; after the movement, it rose to more than 70%. In the Shanghai Embroidery Factory No. 2, out of 195 workers, except for one cook and a school teacher, all were female workers in their forties. Three years ago, most were housewives. Because they worked hard to study technology, they converted more than 130 of the 160 foot-operated embroidery sewing machines in the factory into electric embroidery sewing machines, increasing production efficiency by nearly one time. The "Red Girls" group in the Qiqihar Peace Machinery Factory broke the ideological barrier that "female comrades are stupid and cannot engage in innovation." In 1959, they improved 510 items of technology, tools, operations, and design, and proposed 563 technical innovation suggestions. They completed three years and two months of work in one year, and completed the January production plan twelve days ahead of schedule this year.

In the booming technical innovation and revolution movement, the technical level of female workers has been universally improved, and many people have changed from novices to skilled workers, and from skilled workers to multi-skilled workers. Most of the more than 18,000 female apprentices on the industrial front in Taiyuan City entered the factory in 1958. Currently, more than 90% of the female apprentices can operate independently, and more than 500 have become advanced producers in Taiyuan City. The "March 8th" production team in the Karamay Oil Zone of Xinjiang, which grew up in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, was mostly composed of housewives. Today, it has become a women's production team with skilled production technology. More than 80% of the "March 8th" oil extraction team are engaged in formal oil extraction work, ten serve as station chiefs and deputy station chiefs, and 25 serve as team leaders.

In this movement, the slogan of the female workers is: "No backwardness beside the advanced; skillful girls are heroes on both sides," which shows their noble style. Many deeds have emerged across the country where one advanced person drives the entire group, workshop, or enterprise to achieve overall success. In the Wuzhou Match Factory in Guangxi, Han Xiuzhen, a female worker, helped 127 people improve production efficiency during the production expert movement. The Xiang Yulan group of the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Mill helped backward female workers, enabling all 22 members of the group to reach the standard of textile experts in the city and were praised as "flowers of collectivism." Zhao Mengtao, a female spinner in the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1, took the initiative to exchange the poorly used machine tools with others seven times in a row, enabling twelve female workers to become advanced producers. Under her leadership, the group she belongs to has repeatedly won the honorary title of the factory's advanced collective. With mutual help between groups, the second and third groups in the same shift have also jumped to become the factory's advanced groups. Cao Huiju, a female grinder in the Shanghai Sewing Machine Needle Factory, took the initiative to exchange her light and flexible machine with the backward Kong Zili for use, personally helping her master the technology, and changed Kong Zili, who had many children, to the day shift, while she herself took the night shift. In this way, the title of red banner bearer, which had always been held by Cao Huiju, was transferred to Kong Zili in May last year. After Cao Huiju learned of this news, she rushed to Kong Zili's home overnight to report the good news. Kong Zili was moved and enthusiastically helped others with the spirit of Cao Huiju helping herself. Under the influence of this thought of helping others, a movement of "advanced helping backward, fast hands helping slow hands, skilled hands helping novices" was launched throughout the factory. Currently, 80% of the workers in the factory have reached the expert level stipulated by the factory.

    先进旁边无落后　巧姑娘左右皆英雄
    八百万女职工大闹技术革命
    许多妇女跨过了1960年，由生手变能手，由能手变成多面手
    新华社4日讯　全国八百多万名女职工，卷入了轰轰烈烈的红勤巧俭竞赛运动，她们同广大男职工一道，大闹技术革新和技术革命，纷纷向手工操作机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化进军。
    随着国民经济的全面跃进，我国女职工的队伍迅速扩大，由1957年的三百多万人猛增到1959年的八百多万人。在我国近代化大企业中用手工操作的工序约有30％左右，在街道工业中约有70％左右，分布在手工操作部门的又大部分是妇女。这样，发动广大女职工参加技术革新和技术革命运动，就有着重要的意义。现在，全国各地已经有不少女职工在这方面作出了重大的贡献。她们打破了几千年来旧社会遗留给妇女的自卑依赖思想，发扬了实事求是和敢想、敢干相结合的共产主义风格，大胆创造，大胆革新，出现了许多优秀人物。
    各地有不少女职工由于改进技术，成百倍地提高了劳动生产率，她们已经跨过了1960年。东北机器制造厂的青年女冲压工尉凤英，几年来高举红旗，一直走在时间前面，提前四百三十四天完成了第一个五年计划的生产量。在1959年，她把一套冲具由手工操作改为机械化操作后，提高工作效率一百倍，按照现在定额计划，她已经在做1969年的活了。山东济南第一机床厂女车工马丽珍，今年元旦制造成功半自动化流星滚丝机，生产效率比原来提高三百五十九倍，在1月上旬就已大步跨进1965年。在这以后不久，马丽珍将滚丝机又由半自动化改造成为自动化，生产效率提高了七百多倍。另外，她还试制成功加工不同规格钢板垫圈的专用工具“多头冲”，提高加工效率一百七十九倍，而且质量很好。长辛店通信工厂部件车间车工刘雅君，今年完成了六个革新项目，改进了好几种刀具和加工方法，现在她已经在进行1963年的生产了。
    参加技术革新的女职工也由过去的少数人发展成为广泛的群众运动。1959年重庆市开展巧姑娘运动以前，女职工参加技术革新和技术革命运动的只有10％，巧姑娘运动开展以后，上升到70％以上。上海绣品二厂一百九十五个职工中，除一名炊事员和厂校教师外，全是年龄四十多岁的女工，三年前大都是家庭妇女，由于她们刻苦钻研技术，把全厂一百六十多台脚踏绣花缝纫机中的一百三十多台改装成电动绣花缝纫机，使生产效率提高将近一倍。齐齐哈尔和平机械厂“红姑娘”小组，破除了“女同志头脑笨，不能搞革新”的思想障碍，在1959年内改进工艺、工具、操作、设计等五百一十项，提出技术革新建议五百六十三项，在一年的时间内完成了三年零二个月的工作量，今年1月份又提前十二天完成了1月份的生产计划。
    在轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，女职工的技术水平有了普遍的提高，许多人由生手变成了能手，由能手变成了多面手。太原市工业战线上的一万八千多名女学徒工，大都是1958年进厂的，目前，90％以上的女学徒工已经能独立操作，有五百多名成为太原市的先进生产者。新疆克拉玛依石油区在1958年大跃进中成长起来的“三八”生产队，大都是家庭妇女，今天已成为一支拥有熟练生产技术的妇女生产队，其中“三八”采油队有80％以上的人担任了正式采油工作，十人担任正副站长，二十五人担任班长。
    在这个运动中，女职工们的口号是：“先进旁边无落后，巧姑娘左右皆英雄”，表现了她们高尚的风格。全国出现了许多一人先进带动整个小组、车间、企业，实现满堂红的事迹。广西梧州市火柴厂女工韩秀珍在开展生产能手运动中，她一人帮助了一百二十七人提高生产效率。天津棉纺四厂相玉兰小组帮助后进女工，使全组二十二人都达到市纺织能手的标准，被誉为“集体主义之花”。西北国棉一厂细纱女工赵梦桃，连续七次主动与人调换不好使用的机台，使十二个女工成为先进生产者。她所在的小组在她的带动下一再获得厂的先进集体的光荣称号，在组与组互相帮助下，使同班的第二、三小组也一跃而成为厂的先进小组。上海缝纫机针制造厂女磨工曹慧菊主动把自己轻巧灵活的机器换给后进的孔自力使用，亲手帮助她掌握技术，又把孩子多的孔自力换成日班，自己随夜班。这样，一直由曹慧菊保持的红旗手称号，去年5月份就转移给孔自力了。曹慧菊知道了这个消息后，连夜赶到孔自力家里去报喜。孔自力受到感动，又以曹慧菊帮助自己的精神热情地去帮助别人。在这种助人为乐的思想影响下，全厂开展了“先进帮后进，快手帮慢手，熟手帮生手”的运动。全厂目前已有80％的工人达到厂里规定的能手水平。
