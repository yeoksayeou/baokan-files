Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: In the high tide of spring plowing production, farmers in various regions are persisting in spare-time study, raising the resounding slogan of "Production First, Learning Follows." A moving scene of "tens of thousands of people engaged in production, the sound of reading heard all over the mountains and fields" has appeared in the vast countryside.

With the task of agricultural technological transformation being put forward, 500 million farmers are increasingly eager to become masters of culture and science. The enthusiasm for learning among the masses is high, and the number of students enrolling continues to rise. According to statistics from only eight provinces and autonomous regions including Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, and Gansu, more than 61.84 million people are participating in literacy campaigns and spare-time study, an increase of 15.6% compared to before the Spring Festival. In most counties and cities in Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Henan provinces, classes resumed promptly after the Spring Festival, and the enrollment rate has remained stable at the highest level before the Spring Festival.

"Serving production, persisting in learning, being flexible and diverse, and making ingenious arrangements" is an important reason why rural spare-time education can persist and develop. Fujian Province closely integrates with the "Wanbao Mountain" development campaign and the upsurge of spring plowing and drought resistance, achieving four follows: "Textbooks follow people, teachers follow students, classrooms follow production organization, and learning content follows production tasks," resulting in a full house of learning. Guizhou Province has achieved "learning in the canteen before and after meals, learning in the classroom before and after meetings, learning in the fields during production breaks, reading labels when buying things, and looking at literacy signs while walking," and the number of people persisting in learning has increased from 41% to 79%.

Many regions have changed the past situation of having a large number of illiterate people and have begun to shift from spare-time study centered on literacy campaigns to a new period of vigorously running spare-time elementary schools. Spare-time schools at all levels have also seen great development. In Heilongjiang Province, there are very few illiterate farmers; in the past few years, more than 2.48 million farmers who have graduated from literacy campaigns and have successively entered spare-time elementary schools and spare-time junior high schools to study, and most counties and cities have popularized spare-time elementary education. In Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, more than 1.07 million people are participating in spare-time elementary schools, accounting for more than 90% of the number of people who should be enrolled. In Henan Province, 9 million farmers have entered spare-time elementary schools, and have developed various professional spare-time red and expert schools such as machinery, agriculture, and animal husbandry, with the production team as the unit. Lin County has established 159 vocational, forestry, pig breeding, iron and steel and other specialized schools, with more than 17,000 students.

In order to meet the needs of the development of spare-time schools at all levels, various regions are doing everything possible to train and improve teachers. According to statistics from 53 counties and cities in Fujian Province, a total of 120,000 spare-time teachers have been trained in short-term courses since the second half of last year, and more than 90% of spare-time teachers have received one or more trainings. In Heilongjiang Province, in addition to the province, prefectures, and counties holding short-term training courses for backbone spare-time teachers in worker-peasant normal schools, the communes and management areas have adopted the "chain" method to train teachers, forming a normal education network. Bin'an People's Commune in Bin County has established a Saturday Normal School, which absorbs teachers from spare-time junior high schools and normal schools to participate, and concentrates on studying once every Saturday. The next day, they went back to the Sunday Normal School in the management area and gave classes to spare-time elementary school teachers. Lingling County, Hunan Province, carried out the "Hundred, Thousand, Ten Thousand" spare-time teacher training campaign, that is, the county trained 100 spare-time teacher team leaders in a concentrated manner, the commune trained 1,000 backbone spare-time teachers in a concentrated manner, and the brigade generally trained spare-time teachers once.

Spare-time schools at all levels have grown and developed under the specific leadership of local party committees. Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hebei, Heilongjiang and other provinces and many prefectures, cities and counties have established or are preparing to establish spare-time education committees. Jiangxi Province has established leadership organizations for literacy and spare-time education at all levels from top to bottom. Jinan and Southeast Jinan prefectures in Shanxi Province have allocated more than 4,500 full-time or semi-detached spare-time school directors of studies and secretaries to spare-time schools, forming a strong professional team. Some brigades in Fujian Province have also equipped themselves with semi-detached worker-peasant education cadres according to needs, so that "there is someone in charge at every level, and everything is taken care of."

In order to further consolidate and improve spare-time schools at all levels, various regions are planning to achieve "model soldiers become forests, red flags become pieces, and experiences become sets" through movements such as "Iron People's Schools" and Red Flag People's Schools. Henan Province proposes that the conditions for "evergreen" spare-time red and expert schools are: often serving the center, combined with good production; the masses are highly motivated to learn, and the number of young and middle-aged people enrolled reaches 90%; ensure learning time, adhere to 250 days of learning throughout the year, more than 500 hours; have a sound organizational leadership structure and learning system; have a certain number of teachers; and have remarkable teaching achievements. The Sheyang County Party Committee of Jiangsu Province requires the spare-time schools of all factories, enterprises, communes, and water conservancy construction sites to achieve "red political ideology, red production labor, red cultural learning, and red technological innovation."

    课本跟人走　教师跟学员走　课堂跟生产走　内容跟任务走
    春耕中农村业余学习让路不停车
    新华社28日讯　在春耕生产的高潮中，各地农民坚持业余学习，提出“生产第一，学习跟上”的响亮口号，广大农村出现了
  “千军万马搞生产，满山遍野读书声”的动人景象。
    随着农业技术改造任务的提出，五亿农民越来越迫切地要求成为文化科学的主人。群众学习情绪高涨，入学人数不断上升。仅根据河北、江苏、安徽、湖南、广西、四川、黑龙江、甘肃等八个省、自治区的统计，参加扫盲和业余学习的有六千一百八十四万余人，较春节前增加了15．6％。黑龙江、福建、河南等省绝大部分县、市，在春节后复课及时，入学率一直稳定在春节前的最高水平。
    “服务生产，坚持学习，灵活多样，巧妙安排”，是农村业余教育能够坚持和发展的一个重要原因。福建省紧密结合开发“万宝山”运动和春耕抗旱的高潮，做到四跟四走：“课本跟人走，教师跟学员走，课堂跟生产组织走，学习内容跟生产任务走”，出现了学习满堂红。贵州省做到“饭前饭后食堂学，会前会后课堂学，生产休息田间学，买东西看条子，走路看识字牌”，坚持学习的人数由41％上升到79％。
    很多地区已经改变了过去文盲众多的面貌，开始由以扫盲为中心的业余学习转为大办业余初等学校的新时期。各级业余学校也有很大的发展。黑龙江全省农民中，文盲已经寥寥无几；几年来经过扫盲毕业而陆续升入业余初等学校和业余初中学习的农民已经达到二百四十八万余人，大部分县、市已经普及了业余初等教育。湖南省常德专区参加业余初等学校学习的有一百零七万多人，占应入学人数的90％以上。河南省有九百万农民进入业余初等学校，并以生产队为单位，发展了机械、农业、牧畜等各种专业性的业余红专学校。林县建立了技工、林业、养猪、钢铁等各种专业学校一百五十九所，学员一万七千多人。
    为了适应各级业余学校发展的需要，各地都在千方百计地培养和提高师资。据福建省五十三个县、市统计，去年下半年以来共短期培训业余教师十二万人次，有90％以上的业余教师受到一次以上的训练。黑龙江省除了省、专区、县分别举办工农师范学校短期训练业余教师的骨干外，公社和管理区采取了“连环套”的办法培训师资，形成师范教育网。宾县宾安人民公社举办了星期六师范学校，吸收业余初中和师范学校的教师参加，每星期六集中学习一次。第二天，他们就分头回管理区的星期日师范学校，给业余初等学校教师上课。湖南省零陵县开展“百、千、万”业余教师训练运动，即由县里集训一百名业余教师组长，公社集训一千名业余教师骨干，大队普遍训练一次业余教师。
    各级业余学校是在各地党委具体领导下成长壮大起来的。湖南、江西、山东、河北、黑龙江等省和许多专区、市、县都已经成立或准备成立业余教育委员会。江西全省自上而下已经层层建立了扫盲、业余教育的领导机构。山西省晋南、晋东南两个专区给业余学校调配了专职的或半脱产的业余学校教导主任和秘书四千五百多人，组成一支强有力的专业队伍。福建省有些大队也根据需要配备了半脱产工农教育干部，做到“层层有人管，事事有人抓”。
    为了进一步巩固和提高各级业余学校，各地正有计划地通过“铁民校”、红旗民校等运动，达到“标兵成林，红旗成片，经验成套”。河南省提出“四季常青”业余红专学校的条件是：经常服务中心，结合生产好；群众学习积极性高，青壮年入学人数达到90％；保证学习时间，坚持全年学习二百五十天，五百小时以上；有健全的组织领导机构和学习制度；有一定数量的教师；教学成绩显著。江苏省射阳县委要求各工厂、企业、公社、水利工地的业余学校做到“政治思想红、生产劳动红、文化学习红、技术革新红”。
