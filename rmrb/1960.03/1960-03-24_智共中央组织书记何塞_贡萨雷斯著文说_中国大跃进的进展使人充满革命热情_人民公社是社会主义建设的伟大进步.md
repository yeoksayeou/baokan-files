    China's Great Leap Forward Progress Fills People With Revolutionary Enthusiasm
    People's Communes are a Great Step Forward in Socialist Construction
    [Report from this newspaper] Chilean Communist Party Central Organization Secretary Jose Gonzalez published an article in the Chilean Communist Party's journal "Principles" in January, entitled "The Beautiful Chinese Reality," praising the achievements of China's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and refuting the slanders of the imperialists.
    The article begins: "The great progress made by this great country in the 'Great Leap Forward' in economic recovery and socialist construction fills us with revolutionary enthusiasm and gives us greater optimism and confidence in the complete victory of our principles. There, one can see what the proletariat and the peasantry can achieve once they have seized power under the guidance of a Marxist-Leninist party." "We see that China has never paid so much attention to developing the initiative of the people, so much emphasis on people, and the government is most concerned with educating the people, developing culture, so that everyone can enjoy culture, and ensuring the living conditions and health of the masses."
    The article says: "Six hundred and five million Chinese people are resolutely engaged in socialist construction, implementing the general line put forward by the Party of 'going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results,' as well as a whole set of principles summarized as the slogan 'walking on two legs.'"
    The article says: "The rapid progress of the Chinese people in socialist construction... has aroused the attacks and slanders of international imperialism."
    The article points out: "The mass movement of steelmaking is the result of the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the workers and peasants, inspired by the Party's general line of building a socialist society with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." The imperialists' claims that "it is very expensive to make steel using indigenous methods of blast furnaces" and that it is not worth the effort are all slanders and rumors. "Using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods of steelmaking is both suitable and economical" and "is a first-rate contribution to socialist construction" because "steel production is the key link to enable the industrial production to make a great leap forward."
    The article refutes the attacks of the imperialists and the enemies of the Chinese revolution on the People's Communes, saying: "The People's Commune movement is an initiative of hundreds of millions of peasants. In situations where large-scale water conservancy projects and road construction are needed, and where it is necessary to fight against floods and droughts, some cooperatives have united in order to develop agricultural production at a faster rate. Thus, people understand that although cooperatives have played an important role in agricultural development, they still need a broader organizational form that can eliminate the backwardness caused by thousands of years of feudal servitude at a faster rate and develop agriculture at the speed of industrial development." "The Party perfected this initiative from the masses, making it achieve truly astonishing results in practice. The People's Communes have formed a great leap forward in the collective development of agriculture in China. Cooperatives and People's Communes are both socialist in nature, both maintain socialist ownership and the distribution according to labor, but People's Communes, unlike cooperatives, do not only engage in agriculture. In addition to agriculture, they also develop commerce, industry and mining, education, national defense, organize people's lives, and integrate government with the commune, etc." "As for ownership, the commune has the seeds of ownership by the whole people, which is a great step forward in socialist construction." "As the People's Communes become more perfect and consolidated, their advantages become more apparent in the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, in the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, in increasing farmers' income, improving living conditions in rural areas, and establishing public canteens, schools, homes for the elderly, and nurseries."

    中国大跃进的进展使人充满革命热情
    人民公社是社会主义建设的伟大进步
    本报讯　智利共产党中央组织书记何塞·贡萨雷斯在1月份的智共党刊“原则”上发表题为“美丽的中国现实”的文章，赞扬我国社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的成就，驳斥帝国主义者的诬蔑。
    文章开头说：“这个伟大国家在恢复经济和建设社会主义方面的‘大跃进’所取得的伟大进展，使我们充满着革命热情，使我们对我们的原则的彻底胜利抱着更大的乐观主义和信心。在那里，人们可以看到，无产阶级和农民在马克思列宁主义政党的引导下一旦掌握了政权能够实现什么东西。”“我们看到，中国从来没有像今天这样注意发挥人民的积极性，这样重视人，政府最关心的是教育人民，发展文化，使人人都能享有文化，保证群众的生活条件和健康。”
    文章说：“六亿五千万中国人坚决地投入社会主义建设中，实现党提出的‘鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义’的总路线以及概括为‘两条腿走路’口号的一整套原则。”
    文章说：“中国人民在社会主义建设中的突飞猛进，……引起了国际帝国主义的攻击和诽谤。”
    文章指出：“大炼钢铁的群众运动是工农群众在党的多、快、好、省地建设社会主义社会的总路线的鼓舞之下，发挥了热情、积极性和创造性的结果。”帝国主义所说的“什么用土高炉的方法炼钢非常昂贵”、什么得不偿失等，都是诬蔑造谣。“用土洋结合的方法炼钢既合适又经济”，“是对社会主义建设的一项头等的贡献”，因为“钢的生产是使工业生产能够大跃进的关键环节。”
    文章在驳斥帝国主义和中国革命的敌人对人民公社的攻击时说：“人民公社运动是千百万农民群众的创举，在需要进行大规模的水利工程和筑路工程、需要同水旱灾进行搏斗的情况下，一些合作社就联合起来，以便用更快的速度发展农业生产。这样，人们就懂得，尽管合作社在农业发展中起了重要的作用，但他们还需要一个范围更广的、以更快的速度消灭几千年来封建奴役所造成的落后状态、并以发展工业的速度来发展农业的组织形式。”“党把这个来自群众的创举加以完善，使它在实践中获得真正惊人的成果。人民公社在中国农业集体发展中形成了大跃进。合作社和人民公社都是社会主义性质的，都保持社会主义所有制和按劳取酬的分配方式，但是人民公社不像合作社那样只从事农业，除农业外，它还发展商业、工矿业和教育、国防事业，组织人民生活，使政社合一等。”“至于谈到所有制，公社有全民所有制的萌芽，是社会主义建设的一个伟大进步。”“随着人民公社更加完善和巩固，它的优越性在农、林、牧、副、渔的同时发展、在工农业的同时发展、在增加农民收入、改善农村生活条件和建立公共食堂、学校、敬老院、托儿所等方面更加显示出来了。”
