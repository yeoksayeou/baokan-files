Kashgar Prefecture is located in the southern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a total of twelve counties (cities), covering a total area of more than 132,000 square kilometers, and inhabited by more than 1.7 million people of eight ethnic groups, mainly Uyghurs. Here, there is vast fertile land, and eight major rivers originating from the Pamir and Kunlun Mountains, which can be irrigated year-round. Located in the heart of the Asian continent, the climate is mild, with a frost-free period of up to 200 days throughout the year. It is suitable for planting crops such as rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, and cotton, oil crops, as well as fruit trees, mulberry, and horticultural crops. In particular, due to soil and climatic conditions, it is more suitable for sowing cotton, and it can be said to be an ideal cotton-growing area in China. The mountains and plains here have abundant natural grasslands with lush water and grass, and the conditions for developing animal husbandry are also very favorable. However, due to the cruel rule of successive feudal ruling classes before liberation, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the division of national unity, the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all ethnic groups were in a state of long-term backwardness, and the people's lives were extremely impoverished. "No clothes to wear in the cold winter, apricots and mulberries to fill the hungry belly," this is a portrayal of the past lives of all ethnic groups here.

With the liberation of Xinjiang, the era of national oppression is gone forever. For more than ten years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Kashgar region has carried out a series of democratic reforms and socialist transformations, so that all ethnic groups are closely following the direction indicated by the Party, and carrying out large-scale socialist economic construction. The Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958 enabled agricultural and animal husbandry production to move towards a new stage of high-speed development. In 1959, after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the region achieved another brilliant victory in the continuous leap forward of agriculture and animal husbandry, and the total value of industrial and agricultural output reached 393 million yuan. The total grain output reached 1.56 billion jin, the total cotton output reached 576,000 dan, and the total oil output reached 283,800 dan. Grain, cotton, and oil were 195.1%, 274.2%, and 103.67% of the pre-Great Leap Forward year of 1957, respectively. Animal husbandry has also developed, and the total number of livestock has reached more than 2.7 million head. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is being built into a new cotton base in the motherland, and Kashgar Prefecture has become the prefecture with the largest cotton planting area in the autonomous region.

Agricultural and animal husbandry production is the foundation of economic construction in the Kashgar region and the center of the leap forward in various tasks. As long as agricultural and animal husbandry production has a great leap forward, it will provide favorable conditions for the development of industry, transportation, finance, trade, culture, education, and health. According to the specific conditions of Kashgar Prefecture, such as the large amount of wasteland, the original extensive cultivation, and the large proportion of animal husbandry, our policy for developing agriculture and animal husbandry is to develop agriculture and animal husbandry simultaneously, expand cultivated land area and increase yield per unit area simultaneously, take grain as the key, increase grain production and increase cotton production simultaneously, implement diversified operations, and achieve an all-round leap forward. According to this policy, the total grain output of Kashgar Prefecture this year will increase by 11.56%, the total cotton output will increase by 12.5%, the total oil output will increase by 11.76%, and the number of livestock will increase by 11.03%. Undoubtedly, this is a plan for continued great leap forward.

The current rural situation in Kashgar region is very favorable for completing this year's leap forward plan. The socialist awareness of the broad masses in rural areas has been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for labor production has been unprecedentedly high. A socialist competition upsurge of spring plowing and sowing, with everyone chasing each other, has been set off in rural areas. The preparatory work for spring plowing, centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, started earlier than in previous years and was fully prepared. The main rivers in the region have been fundamentally harnessed, and 41,007 large, medium, and small canals and 62 reservoirs have been built and renovated, increasing the water volume by more than 1.3 billion cubic meters. More than 8,000 jin of manure has been accumulated per mu of land in the region. Before spring sowing, 250,000 mu of wasteland was reclaimed. The field management of more than 2.6 million mu of winter wheat has also been done more carefully than in previous years, achieving full and strong seedlings. What is particularly important is that after two consecutive years of leap forward, cadres at all levels and farmers of all ethnic groups have accumulated relatively rich experience in high-yield production and experience in organizing large-scale production.

Relying on and giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes, which are large in scale and high in degree of public ownership, and comprehensively and adapting to local conditions to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of agriculture. There are more than 11 million mu of reclaimable wasteland in the Kashgar region, and soil salinization accounts for about 47% of the cultivated land. Therefore, implementing the "soil" character of the "Eight-Point Charter" requires not only deep plowing and leveling the land, and increasing the multiple cropping index, but also reclaiming as much wasteland as possible, and comprehensively preventing and controlling the saline-alkali disasters of existing cultivated land. In the past ten years, the planting area has been expanded by an average of more than 130,000 mu per year, which has played a considerable role in increasing output. This year, it is planned to reclaim 600,000 mu of land, and the spring sowing area alone can be expanded by 150,000 mu. Only by expanding the cultivated land area can we vigorously develop cotton crops under the condition of taking grain as the key. Most of the saline-alkali soils in Kashgar are distributed in the lower reaches of various rivers. The yield per unit area of these lands is very low. In the most severely saline-alkali areas of Jiashi County, the yield per mu is only about 20 jin. Before the communization, due to the limitations of cultivation boundaries and strength, it was impossible to uniformly build drainage and alkali control projects, and only local and small-scale prevention and control could be carried out. Communization provides conditions for the comprehensive prevention and control of soil alkalization. Various places have adopted various methods such as salt washing, sand pressing and soil covering, planting alkali-resistant crops, and digging alkali ditches to comprehensively manage saline-alkali disasters. In terms of "water," this area was a self-flowing irrigation area in the past. The main problem is that the old canal system is chaotic, and the riverbeds and canals are leaking, wasting more than 70% of the water. Therefore, the task of implementing the "water" character is mainly to improve the water conservancy standards, so that the canal system is engineered, the irrigation ditches are furrowed, and the management is scientific, so as to tap the potential of existing water sources. Since last winter and this spring, the major rivers and canals have been comprehensively harnessed, and the irrigation system within the communes has also been generally rebuilt in conjunction with leveling the land. This year, most of the 6.6 million mu of cultivated land have reached the requirements of "three transformations" of water conservancy. The "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture is closely related to each other, and in each period, due to different crops, we must grasp its main aspects. At present, the high-yield plot movement has been widely carried out throughout the region, and the area of high-yield plots for various crops will account for 20% to 30% of the sown area. This is a revolution in the cultivation system for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture under the conditions of people's communes. This year, various places will not only establish high-yield plots in high-yield areas, but also establish high-yield plots in low-yield areas. Not only will high-yield plots be established in nearby areas, but also high-yield plots will be established in distant fields. Not only will high-yield plots be established in agriculture, but also high-yield groups will be established in animal husbandry. Through vigorously carrying out the high-yield plot movement, implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" in a manner appropriate to local conditions and meticulously, promoting the comprehensive development of various crops and seedlings, thoroughly changing the cultivation situation, and determined to complete and overfulfill this year's production increase plan.

The key to realizing the continuous great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production this year is to further strengthen the Party's leadership and vigorously launch mass movements. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have deeply realized that as long as the Party committees at all levels adhere to putting politics in command, constantly arming cadres and the masses with the spirit of the general line, and fully mobilizing the subjective initiative of the people, any difficulties facing us can be overcome. The process of realizing a continuous great leap forward is actually a process of continuous struggle between two ideologies and two lines. In each period, some people will always have this or that right-leaning thought and fear of difficulty in the face of new things and difficulties. The Party's leadership must first of all recognize the situation, identify the direction, constantly educate and overcome this negative thinking, establish the idea of continuous revolution, and make the masses always maintain vigorous fighting spirit. The reason why the total grain and cotton output of the prefecture in 1959 could increase by nearly one time and more than one and a half times compared with 1957 is because under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region, we continuously carried out the struggle between two ideologies and two lines according to the law of ideological liberation - work leap forward, ideological re-liberation - work re-leap forward, constantly boosted the enthusiasm of the masses, and vigorously launched mass movements. At the beginning of this year's spring production, we used various meetings to talk about the situation and conditions to cadres and masses of all ethnic groups, specifically analyzed favorable factors and potentials, and established the ambition to continue the leap forward, thereby overcoming the conservative thinking of some cadres who believed that "production has reached the top." We have formulated a production plan for continuing the great leap forward, which has led to a vigorous leap forward situation in spring production. In vigorously launching mass movements, we have realized that as long as we strengthen the Party's leadership and extensively mobilize the masses, we will be invincible. The water conservancy construction last winter and this spring is the most vivid example. We mobilized 30% of the labor force in the entire prefecture and adopted the method of large corps and large-scale collaboration. We completed almost the same amount of work in three months as in the past ten years and comprehensively harnessed the five major rivers in the territory. The Party has always adopted an enthusiastic leadership attitude towards mass movements. This year, we have conscientiously and meticulously carried out large-scale evaluations and inspections at all levels, combined on-site meetings with inspections and evaluations, and closely integrated solving ideological problems with promoting work and exchanging experiences, so as to promote the double leap forward of ideological work. As a result, a production competition upsurge of striving for the upper reaches and catching up with the advanced has emerged everywhere.

Constantly improving the level of leadership and improving the work style of cadres is an important task of the Party's work in the future. The work style of cadres at all levels in the prefecture has changed greatly in recent years. Especially since the campaign to learn from the model production team leader Yu Suying Aishan in the prefecture and autonomous region last year, cadres at all levels below the county level have generally gone deep into the grassroots level, and everyone has planted experimental fields, taking root in the front line of production. Grassroots cadres generally participate in labor frequently and lead in labor. Cadres at all levels should conscientiously study the Party's various guidelines and policies, study Chairman Mao's works, often go deep into reality, conduct investigations and studies, summarize experiences, analyze the development trend of new things, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and one-sidedness and blindness in work, enhance foresight, and improve the level of political thought. This year, cadres at all levels must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works and master Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we further improve the leadership level of cadres of all ethnic groups, catch up with the development of the situation, and lead the broad masses to realize the 1960 plan of taking grain as the key and achieving an all-round leap forward.

    喀什步入跃进的新阶段
    中共喀什地委第一书记　孟树林
    喀什专区在新疆维吾尔自治区的南部，共辖十二个县（市），总面积十三万二千多平方公里，居住着以维吾尔族为主体的八个民族，共一百七十多万人。这里有广阔肥沃的土地，有八条从帕米尔和昆仑山发源的主要河流，可以常年灌溉。这里处于亚洲大陆腹地，气候温和，全年无霜期长达二百多天。适宜种植稻、麦、玉米、高粱和棉花、油料等农作物，以及果木蚕桑园艺作物。特别是由于土壤、气候条件，更适宜于播种棉花，可以说是我国理想的植棉地区。这里的山区和平原，都有水草丰盛的天然草原，发展畜牧业的条件也十分优越。但是，由于解放前历代封建统治阶级，特别是国民党反动的残酷统治和分裂民族团结，使各民族政治、经济和文化长期处于落后状态，人民生活极端贫困。“寒冬无衣履、桑杏充饥腹”，这便是过去这里各族人民生活的写照。
    随着新疆的解放，民族压迫的时代也一去不复返了。十年多以来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，喀什地区进行了一系列的民主改革和社会主义改造运动，从而使各族人民亲密无间地沿着党所指示的方向，进行着大规模的社会主义经济建设。1958年的大跃进和人民公社化运动，使农牧业生产迈向高速度发展的新阶段。1959年经过反右倾，鼓干劲，全区又取得了农牧业继续跃进的辉煌胜利，工农业总产值达到了三亿九千三百多万元。粮食总产量达到了十五亿六千万斤，棉花总产量五十七万六千多担、油料总产量二十八万三千八百多担。粮、棉、油分别为大跃进前1957年的195．1％、274．2％和103．67％。畜牧业也有所发展，牲畜总头数达到二百七十多万头。新疆维吾尔自治区正在建设成为祖国植棉的新基地，喀什专区则成为自治区植棉面积最大的专区。
    农牧业生产是喀什地区经济建设的基础，各项工作跃进的中心。只要农牧业生产有了很大的跃进，就为工业、交通、财经贸易、文教卫生等事业的发展提供了有利的条件。根据喀什地区荒地多、原来耕作粗放、畜牧业占比重很大等具体情况，我们发展农牧业的方针是发展农业与发展畜牧业同时并举，扩大耕地面积与提高单位面积同时并举，以粮为纲，增产粮食与增产棉花同时并举，实行多种经营，全面跃进。根据这一方针，喀什专区今年粮食总产量将增产11．56％，棉花总产量将增产12．5％，油料总产量将增产11．76％，牲畜头数增加11．03％。无疑地，这是一个持续大跃进的计划。
    当前喀什地区农村形势对完成今年跃进计划十分有利。农村广大群众的社会主义觉悟已经大大提高，劳动生产热情空前高涨，农村中已经掀起了一个你追我赶的春耕春播社会主义竞赛高潮。以水、肥、土为中心的备耕工作，比往年动手早，准备充分。全区主要河流都进行了根本治理，兴修和整修大中小渠道四万一千零七条、水库六十二座，增加水量十三亿多公方。全区每亩地积肥八千多斤。到春播前开垦荒地二十五万亩。二百六十多万亩冬麦的田间管理也比往年做得细，达到苗全苗壮。特别重要的是经过两年连续跃进，各级干部和各族农民都积累了比较丰富的丰产经验和组织大生产的经验。
    依靠和发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性全面地和因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，是高速度发展农业的根本保证。喀什地区可垦荒地有一千一百多万亩，已耕地中土壤盐碱化占到47％左右。因此贯彻“八字宪法”的“土”字，就不仅要深翻和平整土地，提高复种指数，还要尽可能多开垦荒地，全面防治现有耕地盐碱灾害。过去十年中，平均每年开荒扩大播种面积十三万多亩，对增加产量起了不小的作用，今年开荒造田计划六十万亩，光是春播面积就可扩大十五万亩。只有耕地面积扩大了，才能在以粮为纲的条件下，大力发展棉花作物。喀什盐碱化土壤大都分布在各河下游，这些土地单位面积产量很低，伽师县盐碱化最严重的地区亩产只有二十来斤。公社化以前，由于受到耕作界限和力量的限制，不能统一兴修排水治碱工程，只能局部地、小面积的防治。公社化为全面防治土壤碱化提供了条件。各地采用洗盐、压沙盖土、种植抗碱作物、挖碱沟等多种方法，综合治理盐碱灾害。在“水”方面，过去这里就是自流化灌溉地区，主要的问题是旧的渠系紊乱，河床渠道渗漏，浪费水量达70％以上，因此贯彻“水”字的任务，主要是提高水利化标准，做到渠系工程化、灌溉沟畦化和管理科学化等三化的要求，挖掘现有水源的潜力。去冬今春以来，对大河和大渠进行了全面治理，社内灌溉系统也结合平整土地普遍进行了改建，今年六百六十多万亩耕地，大部分都达到了水利“三化”的要求。农业“八字宪法”是互相密切连系的，每一个时期因农作物不同，要抓它的主要的方面。当前丰产方运动已在全区广泛开展着，多种农作物丰产方的面积将占到播种面积的20％到30％。这是在人民公社条件下贯彻农业“八字宪法”在耕作制度上的一项革命。今年各地不仅在高产区建立丰产方，低产区也建立丰产方，不但在近地建立丰产方，远田也建立丰产方，不仅农业上搞丰产方，畜牧业也搞丰产群。通过大搞丰产方的运动，因地制宜、踏实细致地贯彻“八字宪法”，带动各种作物、各类苗全面发展，彻底改变耕作面貌，决心完成和超额完成今年的增产计划。
    实现今年农牧业生产持续大跃进的关键，是进一步加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。大跃进以来，我们深切体会到，只要各级党委坚持政治挂帅，以总路线的精神不断武装干部和群众，充分发挥人的主观能动性，摆在面前的任何困难都能克服。实现持续大跃进的过程，实际上就是两种思想、两条路线不断斗争的过程。在每个时期，总会有一部分人在新事物面前、在困难面前，产生这种或那种右倾思想和畏难情绪。党的领导首先就要认清形势，识别方向，不断教育和克服这种消极思想，树立不断革命思想，使群众永远保持旺盛的斗志。1959年专区粮棉总产量之所以能比1957年增产将近一倍和一倍半以上，就是由于我们在自治区党委领导下，根据思想解放——工作跃进，思想再解放——工作再跃进的规律，不断开展两种思想、两条路线的斗争，不断鼓足群众的干劲，大搞群众运动的结果。今年春季生产一开展，我们通过各种会议在各民族干部和群众中，讲形势、摆条件，具体分析有利因素和潜力，树立了持续跃进的雄心壮志，从而克服了某些干部“增产到顶”的保守思想。制定了继续大跃进的生产计划，使春季生产出现了一个轰轰烈烈的跃进局面。在大搞群众运动中，我们体会到，只要加强党的领导、广泛发动群众，就会无往而不胜。去冬今春水利建设就是最生动不过的例子，我们在全专区动员了30％的劳动力，采取大兵团、大协作的办法，三个月完成了几乎等于过去十年的工作量，全面治理了境内五条大河。党对群众运动一直采取了热情领导的态度。今年我们认真细致地开展了层层大评比、大检查，在检查评比中套现场会议，并把解决思想问题和推动工作、交流经验紧密地结合起来，促进思想工作双双跃进。这样作的结果，到处出现了争上游、赶先进的生产竞赛热潮。
    不断提高领导水平，改进干部工作作风，是今后党的工作一项重要任务。专区各级干部的工作作风近年来有很大转变，特别是去年开展学习专区、自治区的标兵生产队长玉素英艾山运动以来，县以下的各级干部普遍深入基层，人人种试验田，扎根在生产第一线。基层干部普遍经常参加劳动，在劳动中领导。各级干部要认真地学习党的各项方针政策，学习毛主席的著作，经常深入实际，调查研究，总结经验，分析新生事物的发展趋势，克服工作中的右倾保守思想和片面性、盲目性，增强预见性，提高政治思想水平。今年，各级干部都要认真学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想。这样才能进一步提高各族干部的领导水平，赶上形势的发展，领导广大群众实现1960年的以粮为纲、全面跃进的计划。
