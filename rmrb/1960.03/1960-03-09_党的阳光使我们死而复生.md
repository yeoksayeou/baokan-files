    To the Editor:
    We are writing this letter not for any other reason than to ask you to tell the people of the whole country: after our food poisoning this time, we received the cordial concern of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the capital. An air force unit dispatched a plane overnight from the capital thousands of miles away to send us life-saving "miracle drugs," which quickly turned us from danger to safety and gave us new life. From this incident, we received another specific and profound communist education. We deeply felt the warmth and happiness of living in a socialist family.
    Editor, it is the Party's sunshine and rain that brought us back to life. The Party is even closer than our own parents. The benefits of the Party are so great that even if we sang praises about them for thousands of generations, we would still not be able to express them all.
    After the incident, we saw in the newspapers that the people of the capital, in order to rescue us, worked day and night, sparing no effort, and put in countless efforts. Their noble communist style and deep spirit of class friendship moved us to tears countless times. We have so much to say, but we just can't express it. Now, we are all very healthy. Recently, we have jointly put forward a new battle slogan: Guarantee to complete three days' worth of work in one day, complete all projects ahead of schedule, and greet the "May 1st" Labor Day with outstanding achievements. Our lives were given by the Party and Chairman Mao, and we will never fail the concern and expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao for us.

### 党的阳光使我们死而复生

    党的阳光使我们死而复生编辑同志：
    我们这次去信，不为别的，是想让你们转告全国人民：我们这次食物中毒后，受到了党中央、毛主席和首都人民的亲切关怀，空军某部星夜派飞机，从千里以外的首都，给我们送来了救命“神药”。使我们很快就转危为安，重新获得了新的生命。从此次事件中，我们又受到了一次具体、深刻的共产主义教育。我们深深感到了生活在社会主义大家庭里的温暖和幸福。
    编辑同志，是党的阳光和雨露，使我们死而复生。党真比我们亲生父母还亲。党的好处，就是拴住太阳，说上千辈万辈也是说不完的。
    事件发生后，我们在报纸上，看到首都人民为了抢救我们，废寝忘食、不辞劳苦，不知花费了多少心血。他们这种崇高的共产主义风格和深厚的阶级友爱精神，使我们感动得不知流了多少次热泪。我们想说的话很多，可就是说不出来。现在，我们都很健康了。最近，我们连提出了新的战斗口号：保证三天活计一天做完，全部工程提前完工，以出色的成绩来迎接“五一”劳动节。我们的生命是党和毛主席给的，我们决不会辜负党和毛主席对我们的关怀和期望。
