According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the workers of Harbin Bearing Factory, in the spirit of taking the initiative step by step, proposed the slogan: "Strive for the best in the first ten days, ensure 80% in the middle ten days, finish the work in five days in the last ten days, and prepare for the remaining five days" when arranging the monthly production tasks. By the 21st, the factory had comprehensively overfulfilled the first quarter's plan in terms of output value, output, variety, and labor productivity. At present, the various preparation works for the second quarter have been arranged, and the tools, work-in-progress, etc. required for production in April have been prepared more fully according to the production cycle.

In the fourth quarter of last year, the factory, based on the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees on the production level in the first quarter of 1960 not being lower than or slightly higher than the production level in the fourth quarter of 1959, and on achieving daily red, ten-day red, monthly red, and a full house red in the first quarter, made a decision on improving management work, insisting on taking one step and grasping two steps, focusing on current production on the one hand, and focusing on production preparation for the next season, next month, and last ten days on the other hand. After the vigorous technical innovation movement was launched, it brought new enlightenment to the factory leaders; due to the continuous emergence of new tools, new processes, and new operating methods, there was more confidence in completing the production plan. Therefore, it was proposed to strive for the best in the first ten days of production (completing 40% of the monthly plan), ensure 80% in the middle ten days (completing 80% of the monthly plan), finish the last ten days' tasks in five days, and use the remaining five days to focus on increasing production and preparing for the next month's production (including the reserve of work-in-progress, materials, tools, technical preparation, and equipment maintenance, etc.). As the slogan truly reflected the workers' demands, the factory's production level was constantly rising throughout the first quarter. By the 21st, the average daily output level had increased by 7.7% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and the output had increased by 14.2%.

The factory's production preparation work adopts a method of overall planning and assigning responsibility at all levels. Long-term preparations are the responsibility of the departments, and short-term preparations are the responsibility of the workshops. Cadres and workers are well aware of the production plan and its implementation, so they have taken the initiative in production and can flexibly dispatch production according to changes in production completion. Long-term quarterly plans are issued one to three months in advance. Then, specific preparation work such as material, tool, and labor accounting and equipment balancing is carried out according to the plan. In grasping short-term preparation, the progress status is checked ten to fifteen days in advance.

Now, the Bearing Factory has proposed "Work hard for a hundred days, tackle the cutting edge, overcome all difficulties, and take the lead in remote control; achieve a daily output of 80,000, save 1,000 tons of steel, fight a decisive battle, and make a major change in the whole factory." Encouraged by this action slogan, the entire factory has prepared for the April production tasks.

    哈尔滨轴承厂创造持续跃进的好经验
    上旬争上游　中旬保八十  下旬五天干完　余下五天抓准备
    据黑龙江日报消息　哈尔滨轴承厂职工本着一步主动，步步主动的精神，在安排每个月的生产任务时，提出了：“上旬争上游，中旬保八十，下旬五天全干完，余下五天抓准备”的口号。到21日，这个厂按产值、产量、品种、劳动生产率全面超额完成了首季计划。目前第二季度的各项准备工作已经安排就绪，4月份生产所需的工具、在制品等已按生产周期作了比较充分的准备。
    这个厂在去年四季度，就根据中央和省、市委关于1960年一季度生产水平不低于或略高于1959年四季度生产水平及实现日日红、旬旬红、月月红、首季满堂红的指示，做出了有关改进管理工作的决定，坚持走一步抓两步，一手狠抓当前生产，一手大抓下季、下月、下旬的生产准备工作。蓬蓬勃勃的技术革新运动开展以后，又给工厂领导方面带来了新的启发；由于新工具、新工艺、新的操作方法的不断出现，完成生产计划更有把握了，于是，就提出了上旬生产争上游（完成全月计划的40％），中旬保八十（完成全月计划的80％），下旬任务五天干完，余下的五天，一手抓增产，一手抓下月的生产准备（包括在制品、材料、工具的储备、技术准备和设备检修等等）。于口号如实地反映了工人的要求，因此，整个第一季度这个厂生产水平是在不断上升。到21日平均日产水平比去年四季度提高7．7％，产量增长了14．2％。
    这个厂的生产准备工作，采取了全面规划、层层负责的办法。长期的准备由科室负责，短期的准备由车间负责。干部、工人对生产计划及执行计划的情况都很了解，因而在生产中掌握了主动权，能够灵活地随着生产完成情况的变化来调度生产。长期的季度计划提前一个月到三个月下达。然后根据计划作材料、工具、劳动力核算、设备平衡等具体准备工作。在抓短期准备上，提前十到十五天检查进度状况。
    现在，轴承厂提出了“大干一百天，攻尖端，破万难，遥远控制走在前；日产八万要实现，节约钢材整一千（吨），打好歼灭战，全厂大改观”。在这个行动口号鼓舞下，全厂已为4月份生产任务做好了准备。
