Technological Innovation Increases Coke Production
    Wuhan Iron and Steel Coke Plant Achieves Mechanization and Automation, Daily Output Increases by 22%
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 1st dispatch) The Wuhan Iron and Steel Coke Plant is carrying out a technological innovation and revolution movement centered on overall mechanization, continuous operation, and automation, actively increasing production and producing more coke to support the continued great leap forward in iron smelting. In a short period of one month, the number of mechanized and semi-mechanized operational positions in the plant increased by 13.1% based on operational positions, continuous automation operational positions increased by 43%, and mechanized, automated, and continuous operational positions increased by 19%. In addition, seventeen high-grade by-products were trial-produced. During this period, more than 1,700 innovation projects appeared throughout the plant, the capacity of thirteen large pieces of equipment doubled, overall labor productivity increased by 30.8%, daily coke production increased by 22%, and costs decreased by 25%.
    Based on the characteristics of a modern large-scale enterprise, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Coke Plant focused on the following four key links in the technological innovation movement: (1) Changing manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization. Although this plant is a modern large-scale enterprise, manual operation still accounts for a considerable proportion. For example, the work of cleaning the top of the coke oven was previously done manually in high temperatures; recently, the workers successfully trial-produced an electric oven sweeping machine, which completely replaced manual operation. In the coke quenching ditch section, manual operation was previously used to transport coke, which occupied a large amount of labor; now, after the automation of coke transportation, nearly half of the workers have been saved to support other production. (2) Changing mechanized, semi-continuous automation to continuous automation. The coal blending, recovery, and refined benzene workshops have basically achieved continuous automation of production through reform. (3) Giving full play to equipment capacity: on the one hand, tapping the potential of equipment, and on the other hand, reforming unreasonable aspects of equipment. (4) Reforming raw materials and materials, and trial-producing new products.
    The Wuhan Iron and Steel Coke Plant originally had a relatively high degree of mechanization and automation. At the beginning of the technological innovation movement, some people believed that these large, foreign equipment were already "fixed" and did not need any innovation, and that doubling production capacity was unimaginable. The facts were just the opposite. The staff and workers of the refined benzene workshop carried out innovations for a week, increasing the capacity of all equipment by two times, and completing a month's task in one week. The design capacity of the blower for absorbing gas in the recovery workshop was 72,000 cubic meters of gas per hour, but in the past it could only actually draw 50,000 cubic meters; the workers proposed many technical measures and boldly carried out the experiment of doubling the blower's capacity, resulting in the extraction of 100,000 cubic meters of gas per hour.
    In the process of technological innovation, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Coke Plant followed the principles of self-reliance, focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and small and simple methods with high efficiency. Among the 143 innovations, basically no foreign equipment was added, and a large amount of equipment was saved due to the simplification of the production process. The complete continuous automation of the refined benzene workshop was assembled by workers using waste iron barrels and waste steel pipes.
    Now, all the staff and workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Coke Plant are advancing towards the great goal of "doubling production, halving personnel, refining good coke from bad coal, and producing coke without spending money." The coke workers are conducting experiments on coal grading and crushing, and coal preheating.

    革新技术　增产焦炭
    武钢焦化厂大闹机械化自动化，日产量提高22％
    本报武汉1日电　武钢焦化厂开展以全盘机械化、连续化、自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，积极提高产量，增产焦炭支援炼铁生产继续跃进。在短短一个月的时间内，按操作岗位计算，这个厂机械化、半机械化的操作岗位增加了13．1％，连续自动化操作岗位增加了43％，机械化、自动化、连续化操作岗位增加了19％。另外，试制了高级副产品十七项。这期间，全厂出现的各种革新项目达一千七百多件，有十三项大型设备能力翻了一番，全员劳动生产率提高30．8％，焦炭日产量提高22％，成本下降25％。
    武钢焦化厂根据现代化大型企业的特点，在技术革新运动中主要抓了以下四个环节：（一）变手工操作为半机械化、机械化。这个厂虽是个现代化大型企业，但是手工操作仍占相当大的比重。例如，焦炉炉顶清扫工作，过去就是靠人力在高温中清扫；工人们最近试制成功一种电动扫炉机，完全代替了手工操作。炼焦大沟工段，过去送焦用手工操作，占用劳动力较多；现在送焦实现自动化以后，节省了将近一半的工人支援其他生产。（二）变机械化、半连续的自动化为连续性的自动化。配煤、回收、精苯等三个车间，经过改革已经基本上实现了生产连续自动化。（三）充分发挥设备能力：一方面挖设备潜力，一方面改革设备不合理的地方。（四）改革原料、材料，试制新产品。
    武钢焦化厂原来的机械化、自动化程度都比较高。技术革新运动开始时，一部分人认为：像这种大、洋设备已经是“定型了”的，不需要来什么革新，生产能力翻番更是不可想像的事。事实恰恰相反，精苯车间的职工大搞革新一个星期，使所有的设备能力增加两倍，一个月的任务一个星期就完成了。回收车间吸收煤气的鼓风机设计能力是每小时抽七万二千立方米煤气，过去实际上只能抽五万立方米；工人们提出了许多技术措施，大胆地进行了鼓风机翻番的试验，结果每小时抽煤气达到十万立方米。
    武钢焦化厂革新技术过程中，遵循了自力更生、以土为主、土洋并举、小而简单效能高的原则。一百四十三项革新中，基本上没有添置洋设备，由于简化生产过程，还节约了大量的设备。精苯车间的全部连续自动化，是工人们利用废铁桶、废钢管装配起来的。
    现在，武钢焦化厂的全体职工正在向“产量翻一番，人员减一半、坏煤炼好焦、焦炭不花钱”的雄心壮志伟大目标前进。炼焦工人正在进行煤的分级破碎、煤的预加热等试验。
