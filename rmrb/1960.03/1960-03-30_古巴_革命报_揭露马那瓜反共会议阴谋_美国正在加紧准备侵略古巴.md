Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 28th. "Revolución" commented today on the anti-communist meeting held in the Nicaraguan capital, planned by Washington, pointing out that the purpose of convening this meeting, attended by the Nicaraguan dictator Somoza and Cuban war criminals, was to bring together elements involved in anti-Cuban conspiracies. The newspaper quoted an Associated Press report from the 26th regarding the meeting: "The anti-communist meeting passed a resolution last night condemning the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba." The newspaper pointed out that this is like a declaration of war against the Cuban Revolution. The newspaper also pointed out that the appearance of prepared ships, secret airfields in some parts of Central America, and mercenaries freely moving with weapons on the Central American plantations of the United Fruit Company in the United States, are consistent with the decisions of the Managua meeting.

The newspaper pointed out that a plan for a brutal attack on Cuba has been formed on the basis of an anti-communist conspiracy. It is no coincidence that American news agencies are intensifying their frantic anti-communist propaganda while the despicable Managua meeting is being held. Anti-communism is covering up the preparations for aggression against the Cuban people.

When talking about the US imperialism instigating the Cuban reactionary press to carry out anti-communist propaganda in order to create an excuse for armed intervention in Cuba, "Revolución" condemned the Cuban "Diario de la Marina," "Prensa Libre," and the reactionary journalist Conte Agüero as fifth columnists. The newspaper warned that they must be responsible for everything implied by their declarations coordinating with the shameless Managua meeting. "Revolución" emphasized that the Cuban people know that preparations for the invasion of Cuba are being carried out intensely abroad. Cuban workers, farmers, and all honest men and women are firmly shouting "We swear to defend the motherland to the death" as a response to such conspiracies.

    古巴“革命报”揭露马那瓜反共会议阴谋
    美国正在加紧准备侵略古巴
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　“革命报”今天在评论由华盛顿策划的在尼加拉瓜首都召开的反共会议时指出，召开这次有尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查等和古巴战犯参加的会议的目的，是把参与反古巴阴谋的分子纠合起来。这家报纸援引美联社26日关于这次会议的下列报道：“反共会议昨晚通过决议，谴责古巴菲德尔·卡斯特罗政权”。报纸指出，这就像一项反对古巴革命的宣战书。报纸还指出，在中美一些地方出现准备好的船只、秘密的飞机场和在美国联合果品公司的中美洲种植园里出现拿着武器自由活动的雇佣兵这些情况，是和马那瓜会议的决定相一致的。
    报纸指出，对古巴发动野蛮的进攻的方案已经在反共阴谋的基础上形成。在召开卑鄙的马那瓜会议的同时，美国通讯社变本加厉地进行以反共为中心的疯狂宣传，这不是偶然的。反共掩护着侵略古巴人民的准备工作。
    “革命报”在谈到美帝国主义为武装干涉古巴制造口实而煽动古巴反动报界进行反共宣传这件事时，谴责古巴“海洋日报”、“自由新闻报”和反动记者孔特·阿古埃罗是第五纵队分子。报纸警告说，它们要对它们配合无耻的马那瓜会议的宣言所意味的一切负责。“革命报”强调指出，古巴人民知道，在国外正在紧张地进行着侵略古巴的准备工作。古巴的工人、农民和所有正直的男女坚定地高呼“誓死保卫祖国”，作为对这种阴谋活动的回答。
