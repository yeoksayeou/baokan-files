    Guanghua Lumber Mill Vigorously Grasps In-Plant Transportation
    Strengthens Leadership Over Transportation, Innovates Loading and Unloading Tools, and Ensures Production Leap Forward
    (Our Newspaper News) Beijing Guanghua Lumber Mill's leading cadres, while focusing on production, implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously grasping transportation work, so that the factory's internal transportation problems are completely solved, and professional vehicles are extracted to participate in social transportation.
    Guanghua Lumber Mill is one of the largest lumber mills in China. The quantity of materials required and products produced by this factory is very large, and in-plant transportation has always been tight. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the continuous improvement of production, transportation work has become increasingly tense. Inside the factory, vehicles often arrive but cannot be unloaded, which greatly affects production.
    After several discussions, the factory's Party Committee clarified the principle that transportation must precede production for a production leap forward. Based on improving ideological understanding, the Party Committee strengthened the organizational leadership of transportation work, and determined that the Party Secretary and Deputy Director each be in charge of transportation work. At the same time, a dispatching agency was added, and cadres and loaders were transferred to strengthen the transportation department. The factory's Party Committee and workshop general branches also included transportation work on the agenda, and promptly studied and resolved problems in transportation. When arranging tasks and inspecting production, transportation work was also arranged and inspected simultaneously.
    Under the specific leadership of the Party Committee, a mass movement of technological innovation and revolution, centered on vigorously developing loading and unloading tools, was launched in a vigorous manner. Loading and unloading workers put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, and created seventy sets of loading and unloading tools combining indigenous and foreign methods. Mechanization and semi-mechanization were fully realized in lumber loading and unloading, handling, stacking, and piling. The efficiency of loading and unloading vehicles increased by two to eighteen times respectively. Workers also manufactured self-unloading board transport vehicles, board holding vehicles and other transportation tools, increasing transportation capacity. At the same time, nine li of roads, ten kilometers of small railways, and five hundred meters of large railways were adjusted and built, making the internal transportation lines of materials and finished products accessible in all directions, basically forming an in-plant transportation system. After loading and unloading work was mechanized and semi-mechanized, it not only ensured the continued leap forward in production, but also reduced the number of loading and unloading workers by two-thirds. The unloading time of vehicles was also reduced from 4.8 hours in the past to one hour (the prescribed target is three hours), greatly improving the turnover rate of vehicles.
    In vigorously grasping in-plant transportation, the factory's Party Committee, through meetings, conducted comprehensive education on the relationship between production and transportation for production and transportation workers. After the production workers understood the importance of in-plant transportation work, they voluntarily helped transportation workers load and unload lumber during holidays, and actively put forward suggestions for improving transportation work. The workers of the Fifth Workshop used their spare time to manufacture a batch of rail-mounted battery cars for the transportation department, as transportation tools for several main workshops, solving the problem of transporting thousands of tons of coal within the factory every month. Transportation workers and production workers also adopted close cooperation and direct allocation methods, transporting the lumber just unloaded directly to the workshop, saving a stacking procedure, which can save 6,000 workdays per month.
    Currently, the factory's employees are further realizing the mechanization and electrification of in-plant transportation, and are actively preparing better transportation conditions for the factory's continued leap forward this year. (Attached picture)

    光华木材厂狠抓厂内运输
    加强对运输的领导　革新装卸搬运工具　保证了生产跃进
    本报讯　北京光华木材厂领导干部在抓生产的同时，贯彻土洋并举的方针，大抓运输工作，使工厂内部的运输问题全部得到解决，并抽出专业车辆参加社会运输。
    光华木材厂是我国最大的木材厂之一。这个厂所需的材料和出厂的产品数量很大，厂内运输一直是紧张的。大跃进以来，随着生产不断提高，运输工作越来越紧张，在工厂内部经常车辆来了卸不了车，对生产影响很大。
    工厂党委会经过几次讨论，明确了生产跃进运输必须先行的道理。在提高思想认识的基础上，党委会加强了对运输工作的组织领导，确定由党委书记和副厂长各一人主管运输工作，同时增设调度机构，抽调干部和装卸工人加强运输部门。工厂党委和车间总支也都把运输工作列入议事日程，及时研究和解决运输中的问题。在布置任务和检查生产的时候，都同时布置和检查运输工作。
    在党委的具体领导下，一个以大搞装卸工具为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，是轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。搬运工人们提出了大批合理化建议，创制了七十台土洋结合的装卸工具；在木材装卸、搬运、码、垛等方面，全部实现了机械化和半机械化，装车和卸车效率分别提高了两倍到十八倍，职工们还制造了自卸运板车、板材抱运车等运输工具，增加了运输力量，与此同时，还调整和修建了九华里马路、十公里小铁道、五百米大铁道，使厂内材料、成品的运输线路四通八达，基本上形成了厂内的运输体系，装卸搬运工作做到了机械化和半机械化以后，不但保证了生产的继续跃进，而且装卸工人还减少了三分之二，车辆的卸车时间也由过去的四点八小时下降到一小时（规定指标是三小时），大大提高了车辆的周转率。
    这个厂的党委会在大抓厂内运输工作中，通过会议形式，分别对生产和运输工人进行了有关生产运输两方面关系的全面教育，生产工人了解了厂内运输工作的重要意义后，在假日里，主动帮助运输工人装卸木料，并且积极提出改进运输工作的建议。第五车间的工人利用业余时间给运输部门制造了一批有轨电瓶车，作为几个主要车间的运输工具，解决了每月厂内要运输成千吨煤的问题。运输工人和生产工人还采取密切配合、直线调拨的方法，把刚卸下来的木料直接运到车间，省去一道码垛的手续，每个月能节省六千个劳动日。
    目前，这个厂的职工正在进一步实现厂内运输的机械化和电气化，积极为今年工厂的继续跃进准备更加良好的运输条件。（附图片）
