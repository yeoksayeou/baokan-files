Fifteen Years of Hungarian Agriculture
By Gyula Fehér (Hungary)

It has been exactly fifteen years since the Soviet army drove the last remnants of German imperialism from Hungarian soil. Hungary was liberated, and workers and peasants seized power, beginning to build a new state. In these fifteen years, unprecedented changes have taken place in the history of the Hungarian people.

Liberation brought land reform, which eliminated the landlord class. Approximately 620,000 landless or land-poor laboring peasants were allocated about one-third of the nation's land. This land had previously been held mostly by a few thousand counts, barons, and landowners. The vast majority of livestock had died or been driven west during the war, and half of the agricultural tractors were destroyed.

Even in this situation, practically devoid of production tools and with very few livestock, production developed at an unbelievable rate; with the diligence of the laboring peasants and the material and political assistance of the working class, the enormous losses in agriculture were rapidly restored.

With the continuous assistance of the Soviet Union and under the leadership of Hungarian communists, a historically significant democratic reform was initiated across the country, pointing the way towards socialist development. The new constitution of the People's Democratic Republic laid the foundation for a new life for the nation, creating the political conditions for building a socialist society.

Socialist industry also developed rapidly. Although some mistakes were made and imbalances occurred in individual sectors of the national economy, the development was unimaginable compared to pre-liberation times. In the decade since 1949, one hundred new large industrial enterprises were established. New socialist industrial cities were born. A thriving agricultural machinery manufacturing industry produces thousands of modern machines each year: tractors, combine harvesters, seeders, etc. Chemical fertilizers, although not yet meeting the greatly increased need, are being delivered in large quantities to infertile lands. Tractor production has increased from 7,000 units per year in 1935 to 31,300 units last year. In 1938, only 13.5 kilograms of fertilizer were applied to each hold (8.55 mu), but this had reached 77 kilograms by 1959. By 1965, fertilizer consumption per hold of land will increase to 140 to 150 kilograms.

Despite the vigorous development of industrial production, agricultural production only increased by 15%. The decisive reason was the outdated production taking place on scattered small plots of land. At the beginning of the collectivization movement, it was estimated that there were 20 million scattered small plots on 9.4 million holds of arable land. On these small plots, farmers could not adopt the achievements of science and machine technology. However, the need for industrial raw materials and the growing demand for grain from residents required agriculture to increase yields. Therefore, it is understandable that farmers, upon hearing good news from Soviet collective farms, voluntarily began to unite and cultivate their land together.

The state initially helped farmers willing to cooperate. Machine stations were established as a base for modern technology, serving agriculture with a large number of machines. In ten years, the state spent 6.5 billion forints (Hungarian currency) on machine stations alone (not including state-owned farms). In this way, we have approximately five times more tractors serving agriculture than at the time of liberation. Currently, there is about one tractor for every 310 holds of arable land, compared to one tractor for every 1,389 holds in the past. By the end of the second five-year plan (1961-1965), the number of agricultural machinery equipment will increase to 62,000 to 63,000 tractors; there will be one tractor for every 150 holds of arable land. At present, all tillage, sowing, and threshing in production cooperatives have been completed by machines. In addition, many other heavy agricultural labors have also been mechanized.

In addition to modern technology, the state supplies agricultural cooperatives with about 100 million kilograms of improved seeds, six to seven train cars of chemical fertilizers, hundreds of thousands of head of fine livestock, and thousands of livestock sheds built with long-term loans each year.

Thanks to the state's political, organizational, and material assistance, the collectivization movement in Hungarian rural areas has firmly taken root over the past decade, and even the counter-revolution could not completely cut it down. In 1959, the collectivization movement experienced a tremendous upsurge, and the socialist transformation of agriculture underwent an unprecedentedly smooth transition.

In just over a year, the number of cooperative members increased to 900,000, with a cultivated area of 5.6 million holds. Socialist ownership has gained dominance in agriculture. 71.3% of the nation's cultivated land already belongs to state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives, of which 13.5% are state-owned farms. At present, there are six collectivized states, seventy-six collectivized counties, and two thousand three hundred collectivized villages in the country, accounting for 70% of all rural areas.

This development is gratifying. With hundreds of thousands of peasants embarking on the socialist path, the people's regime and the worker-peasant alliance have been further consolidated. Great progress has also been made in realizing the resolution of the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to lay the socialist foundation in Hungarian agriculture in the coming years.

This spring, a new life replaced the old life on small plots on most of the land. This has opened up a path for agriculture to overcome its relative backwardness compared to industrial production.

One of the main factors for the mass entry of peasants into cooperatives after the counter-revolutionary events is the trust in the policies of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the worker-peasant revolutionary government. The most important reason for this trust is the agricultural policy of consolidating cooperatives and economically strengthening them, as well as adhering to the principle of voluntariness. However, the higher yields and more progressive farming methods of the cooperatives create a higher standard of living than that of farmers producing on small plots, which also plays a role in persuading farmers. For example, in 1959, state-owned farms exceeded individual farmers' production of grain by 40%-50%, while production cooperatives' grain yields exceeded individual farmers by 25%-30%. In almost all sectors of the old cooperatives, in the first year of joint operation in the new cooperatives, crop production had already proven the undeniable superiority of large-scale production.

Therefore, the lower-middle and middle peasants, who are now the main force of the laboring peasants, have also abandoned individual management methods in droves. In most areas, the farmers in the village often joined the cooperatives together.

In order to develop and consolidate the cooperative economy, the government provided more than 6 billion forints worth of material assistance in 1959, of which 1.5 billion forints were spent on establishing public livestock sheds and farm buildings. Not only in the past decade, but also in the "most prosperous decade" of capitalist Hungary, so many modern, mechanized granaries, cattle sheds with automatic drinking water equipment, feed storage rooms, and milking parlors, simple calf sheds and pigsties, and poultry houses were not built as in 1959. However, members do not expect everything from the state, and the active initiative of cooperative members has been developed on a large scale, using their own tools and strength to jointly manage and increase income.

Simultaneous with large-scale collectivization, total agricultural output exceeded the previous year by 5.7%, and the amount of purchased goods exceeded 7.3%. This proves that the collectivization movement can only be developed by implementing Lenin's collectivization policy with action. Facts show that the dual task can be solved: to continuously improve agricultural production and commodity production while carrying out socialist transformation. In the second five-year plan, agricultural production should be further developed than the level of 1954-1958, with an average increase of 30% to 32% in five years.

Socialist production relations have gained dominance in agriculture. Hungarian agriculture has begun a period of prosperity and upsurge. The liberation of the country fifteen years ago opened the way for these.

April 4th of this year is a double festival for the Hungarian people, workers, and peasants: on the one hand, celebrating the 15th anniversary of the country's liberation and the freedom achieved, and on the other hand, celebrating the achievements of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    匈牙利农业的十五年
    匈牙利　菲赫尔·久拉
    自苏军从匈牙利的土地上赶走了德国帝国主义最后一批军队以来，已经整整十五年了。匈牙利的国土解放了，工人和农民掌握了政权，开始建立起新国家。这十五年间，在匈牙利人民的历史上发生了空前的变化。
    解放带来了土地改革，消灭了地主阶级。大约有六十二万无地或少地的劳动农民分得了国家约三分之一的土地。这些土地过去大部分都掌握在几千个伯爵、男爵和地主手里。绝大部分牲畜在战争期间死亡了或被赶到了西方，农业用的拖拉机也毁坏了一半。
    就在这种实际上没有生产工具，牲畜很少的情况下，生产以令人难以相信的速度发展；在劳动农民的勤奋和工人阶级物质上和政治上的帮助下，农业的巨大损失迅速恢复了。
    在苏联不断的帮助和匈牙利共产党人的领导下，全国开始了有历史意义的民主改革，指出了向社会主义发展的道路。人民民主国家新宪法打下了国家的新生活的基础，创造了建设社会主义社会的政治条件。
    社会主义工业也迅速发展起来，虽然曾犯过某些错误，个别国民经济部门发生了不平衡的现象，但同解放前比较，却达到了梦想不到的发展。1949年以来的十年中建立了一百个新的大工业企业。新的社会主义工业城市诞生了。繁荣的农业机器制造业每年生产几千种现代化机器：拖拉机、联合收割机、播种机等。化学肥料尽管还不能满足大大增长的需要，但已有大量化肥送到肥力不足的土地上。拖拉机由1935年一年生产七千台增加到去年一年生产三万一千三百台。1938年在每一霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）土地上只不过施十三点五公斤肥料，1959年已达到七十七公斤。到1965年，每霍尔特土地上的化肥消耗量将增加到一百四十到一百五十公斤。
    尽管工业生产大力发展，农业生产只提高了15％。决定性的原因在于在分散的小块土地上进行着过时的生产。合作化运动开始时，据估计在九百四十万霍尔特耕地上有二千万块分散的小土地。在这些小块土地上，农民不能采用科学和机器技术的成果。但是工业原料的需要和居民不断增长的粮食要求，需要农业提高收获量。因此可以理解，农民一听到从苏联集体农庄传来的好消息，就自愿地开始联合起来，共同耕种他们的土地。
    国家一开始就帮助愿意合作的农民。作为现代化技术基地的机器站建立起来了，它以大批机器为农业服务。十年中国家只用在机器站方面（国营农场不计在内）就有六十五亿福林（匈币）。这样，我们已经约有五倍于解放时的拖拉机为农业服务。现在大约平均三百一十霍尔特耕地上就有一台拖拉机，从前一千三百八十九霍尔特耕地上才有一台。到第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）结束时，农业机器设备的数量中，拖拉机将增加到六万二千至六万三千台；每一百五十霍尔特的耕地上将有一台拖拉机。目前在生产合作社中已经全部用机器完成耕作、播种和打谷，此外，还有许许多多其他笨重的农业劳动也机械化了。
    除了现代化技术外，国家每年供给农业合作社约一亿公斤良种，六至七车皮化肥，几十万匹优良牲畜和几千个用长期贷款建造的畜棚。
    由于国家在政治上、组织上和物质上的帮助，在过去十年中匈牙利农村中的合作化运动牢牢地扎下了根，即使反革命也不能把它完全砍倒。1959年合作化运动有了巨大的高涨，农业社会主义改造有了前所未有的顺利的转变。
    仅仅一年多的时间，合作社社员就增加到九十万，耕地面积达到五百六十万霍尔特。在农业中社会主义所有制已占了优势。全国耕地面积的71．3％已经属于国营农场和农业合作社，其中13．5％是国营农场。目前国内已有六个合作化的州，七十六个合作化的县和二千三百个合作化的村，占全部农村的70％。
    这种发展是值得欣喜的。随着几十万农民走上社会主义道路，人民政权和工农联盟也进一步巩固了。在实现匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会关于在最近几年内在匈牙利农业中打下社会主义基础的决议方面，也前进了很大的一步。
    今年春天，在大部分土地上新的生活代替小块土地上的旧的生活开始了。这开辟了农业随着工业生产克服相对的落后状态的道路。
    反革命事件以后农民成群入社的主要因素之一，是对匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府政策的信任，而这种信任的最主要原因，是巩固合作社和经济上加强合作社的农业政策，以及遵守自愿的原则。但是合作社更高的产量和较进步的经营耕作，创造了比在小块土地上生产的农民更高的生活水平，这在说服农民时也起着作用。例如在1959年国营农场在谷类方面的生产超过个体农户40％—50％，生产合作社谷物产量则比个体农户超过25％—30％。在老社的差不多所有部门中，在新社共同经营的第一年中，农作物生产已经证明了大企业性生产的无可争辩的优越性。
    因此，现在已成为劳动农民主力军的下中农和中农，也成群地放弃了个体经营的方式。在大部分地区，村里的农民往往是一齐入社的。
    政府为了发展和巩固合作社经济，于1959年提供了价值六十多亿福林的物资援助，其中有十五亿福林放在建立公共畜棚和农场建筑上。不但在过去十年，而且在资本主义匈牙利“最繁荣的十年”中，也没有像1959年这一年中修建那么多现代化的、机械化的谷仓，有自动饮水设备、饲料储藏室和挤奶房的牛棚，简单的小牛棚和猪栏、禽舍。可是社员并不是一切都期待着国家，合作社社员的积极主动性大规模地发挥出来了，他们用自己的工具和力量，来共同经营和增加收入。
    在大规模合作化同时，农业总产量比前一年超过5．7％，收购量超过7．3％。这证明只有用行动来实行列宁的合作化政策，才能发展合作化运动。事实说明，双重任务是能够解决的：在社会主义改造的同时，不断提高农业生产和商品生产。在第二个五年中，要使农业生产比1954—1958年的水平更进一步发展，五年中平均要增长30％到32％。
    社会主义生产关系已在农业中占了优势。匈牙利农业开始了一个繁荣高涨的时期。十五年前国家的解放为这些开辟了道路。
    今年的4月4日是匈牙利人民、工人和农民的双重节日：一方面庆祝国家的解放十五周年和取得的自由，另一方面也庆祝农业社会主义改造取得的成就。（附图片）
