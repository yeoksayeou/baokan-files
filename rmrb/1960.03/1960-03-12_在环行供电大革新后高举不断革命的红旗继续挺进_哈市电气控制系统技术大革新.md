Following the technical innovation of "four-in-one" ring power supply, the Heilongjiang electric power industry system has recently created a new technology of "line selection, weak electricity, town interconnection, and operational communication" for electrical control systems at the Guxiang Substation in Harbin. At the same time, the staff of the Daoli Substation in Harbin also created "remote control" for substation control. These two new technologies have been operating and tested with good results. These two major technological reforms in the Heilongjiang Province electric power industry system can not only save the country a lot of construction funds, save a lot of electrical equipment and building area, but also create conditions for the comprehensive technical transformation of many control equipment.

In order to promote these new technologies, the Heilongjiang Provincial Electric Power Administration organized the electric power system of Heilongjiang Province to visit and study, and vigorously promoted them throughout the province.

The Guxiang Substation in Harbin was originally built according to the usual design. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial production, the amount of electricity consumption continued to rise, and the number of power supply lines continued to increase. The substation equipment in the station also became more and more numerous and complex. The entire station has a total of eight distribution lines, each distribution line has a set of power transmission control, measurement, and signal equipment. This makes the electrical control system more complex. It not only increases construction investment, spends more design and construction manpower, requires cables with higher insulation levels, requires larger meters and distribution panels, and a certain number of operation and maintenance personnel, but also makes operation and maintenance more complicated, which can easily cause accidents and threaten safe power supply. In order to change this situation, five units including the Central Laboratory of Heilongjiang Provincial Electric Power Administration, the Power Design Institute, the Power Construction Company, the Harbin Electric Power Bureau, and the Harbin Institute of Technology cooperated with each other. After more than eight months, they reformed the electrical control system of the substation and realized a major reform of "line selection, weak electricity, town interconnection, and operational communication" in the electrical control system. When this substation was actively carrying out further reforms and striving to achieve "remote control" in the shortest possible time, the staff of the Daoli Substation in Harbin, with the help of the Central Laboratory of the Heilongjiang Provincial Electric Power Administration and other units, realized the "remote control" of the substation, becoming the first remote-controlled substation in Heilongjiang Province.

Reforming the electrical control system and realizing "line selection, weak electricity, town interconnection, remote control, and operational communication" are major technical innovations in substations. "Line selection" is to use line selection relays in the electrical control system to automatically select certain lines, instruments, etc. for use to achieve the intended operation monitoring purposes. This can greatly simplify the electrical control system. For example, in the past, each power supply line in the substation had to be equipped with a set of control, measurement, and signal equipment (such as operating switches, ammeters, power meters, power factor meters, signal lights, etc.). These equipment must also be equipped with a set of small lines to connect related equipment. Therefore, the small lines of the control system in the substation are truly "thousands of strands", extremely complicated. Now, the use of line selection relays can make a small number of control, measurement, and signal equipment arbitrarily selected to the required lines to achieve the purpose of multiple uses of one set of equipment. In this way, the switches, meters, and signal equipment of one set per line (one line) in the past can be removed to achieve simplification and economy. "Weak electricity" refers to changing from strong electricity to weak electricity. Strong electricity generally has a higher voltage and a larger current, which poses a danger of electric shock and death to the human body; weak electricity generally has a lower voltage and a smaller current, which poses no danger to the human body. In the power industry, changing certain electrical control systems in power plants and substations to small-current, low-voltage equipment can utilize weak electrical materials in the electrical control system, such as weak electrical cables, relays, meters, etc., which not only ensures operational safety, but also saves a lot of non-ferrous metals and insulation materials. "Town interconnection" is to install safety operation interlocking devices on the operation control equipment of electrical equipment, which can automatically control and prevent operational accidents and personal accidents. This is an important technical measure to ensure safe production. "Operational communication" means that power plants and substations previously used storage batteries as the power source for operating switches, which is called DC operation. The vast majority of electricity used in the power industry is AC power. Taking some technical measures and supplementing some simple equipment to replace battery operation with AC power is called "operational communication". "Remote control" is to install a set of remote control, remote measurement, and remote signal receiving equipment in the substation, so that employees can directly operate from within the substation and perform operations in the central dispatch center far away from the substation.

Promoting these new technologies brings many benefits to the development of the power industry. First, it can save a lot of national construction funds. After the Guxiang Substation implemented this new technology, it saved the country 52,000 yuan. According to calculations, designing substations according to this experience can save 10% to 15% of the total investment in substations. Second, it saves building area. Promoting these new technologies in newly built substations can simplify the building structure. The substation plant can be changed from a two-story building to a bungalow. The original battery and charger room and cable trench can be eliminated. The area of the main control room can be greatly reduced, saving 40% of the total building area of the substation. Third, it fully taps the potential of control equipment and saves a lot of equipment and materials. Due to the implementation of line selection, a group of equipment is used for centralized control in terms of control, signal, and measurement equipment, which can greatly save equipment and materials, especially some rare non-ferrous metals. Fourth, it saves manpower and improves labor conditions. By reforming and simplifying the control system, operators can perform centralized control on the reformed control console instead of going to various distribution panels for operation as in the past. The battery equipment that was difficult to maintain in the past has also been eliminated. In particular, due to the realization of remote control, the labor intensity of operators can be greatly reduced, personnel can be reduced, and labor productivity can be improved. Fifth, it saves operating costs. Promoting these new technologies eliminates battery packs, eliminates the need for sulfuric acid, saves electricity for chargers, power loss from meter wires, and greatly reduces the amount of maintenance work due to the simplified system. It is estimated that operating and maintenance costs can be saved by 5,000 yuan per year. Sixth, building substations can shorten the construction period and speed up the process. According to calculations, the construction period of substations using these new technologies can be shortened by 20% to 30%. Seventh, operation is simple, easy to maintain, and enhances safety and reliability. By promoting this new technology, the control system is simplified, and the phenomenon of secondary circuit lines being intricate and dense as cobwebs in the past is changed. Operation is more convenient. In particular, the realization of operational control interlocking can fundamentally prevent accidents such as pulling knife switches with load, closing the switch without removing the grounding wire, and accidental electric shock. Eighth, it has opened up new avenues for reforming the design of electrical control systems and for electrical control equipment manufacturing departments to save raw materials.

In the process of these technical reforms, due to the strengthening of leadership by the Party organization, the vigorous development of mass movements, and the consistent implementation of the three-way combination of leading cadres, workers, and engineering technicians, and the combination of production, scientific research departments, and schools, learning, designing, constructing, and testing at the same time, finally succeeded in the experiment.

    在环行供电大革新后高举不断革命的红旗继续挺进
    哈市电气控制系统技术大革新
    黑龙江全省正大力推广顾乡变电所和道里变电所的新经验
    本报哈尔滨11日电　黑龙江电力工业系统继实现“四合一”环形供电的技术革新之后，最近又在哈尔滨顾乡变电所创造了电气控制系统“选线化、弱电化、联镇化、操作交流化”的新技术。同时，哈尔滨道里变电所职工也创造了变电所控制“远动化”。这两项新技术经过运行、操作，效果很好。黑龙江省电力工业系统的这两项重大技术改革，不仅能为国家节省大量建设资金，节省大量电气设备和建筑面积，而且为许多控制设备实行全面的技术改造创造了条件。
    为了推广这些新技术，黑龙江省电业管理局组织黑龙江全省电业系统参观学习，在全省大力推广。
    哈尔滨顾乡变电所原来是按着通常设计建成的。随着工业生产的大跃进，用电量不断上涨，供电线路不断增加，所内变电设备也随着越来越多，越来越复杂。全所共有八条配电线路，每条配电线路都有一套变电控制、测量、信号设备。这样就使电气控制系统更加复杂。不仅增加了建设投资，花费较多的设计、施工力量，需要较高绝缘水平的电缆，需要体积较大的仪表和配电盘，以及一定数量的运行维护人员，而且运行维修也较复杂，容易引起事故，威胁安全供电。为了改变这种情况，黑龙江省电业管理局中心试验所、电力设计所、电力建设公司、哈尔滨电业局和哈尔滨工业大学等五个单位，互相协作配合，经过八个多月的时间，改革了变电所的电气控制系统，实现了电气控制系统“选线化、弱电化、联镇化、操作交流化”的重大改革。当这个变电所正在积极进行进一步的改革，力争在最短期间实现“远动化”的时候，哈尔滨道里变电所的职工，又在黑龙江省电业管理局中心试验所等单位的帮助下，实现了变电所控制“远动化”，成为黑龙江省第一座远动变电所。
    改革电气控制系统，实现“选线化、弱电化、联镇化、远动化、操作交流化”，是变电方面重大的技术革新。“选线化”是在电气控制系统中利用选线继电器来自动选择使用某些线路、仪表等等，用来达到预定的操作监视的目的。这样就可以大大简化电气控制系统。如过去变电所中每一趟供电线路都要各自安设一套控制、测量、信号设备（如操作开关、电流表、电力表、力率表、信号灯等），这些设备同时也必须各自设一套联系有关设备的小线。因此变电所中控制系统的小线真是“千丝万缕”，极为复杂。现在采用选线继电器就可使少数的控制、测量、信号设备随意的选用到所需要的线路上去，达到一套设备多种使用的目的，这样就可以拆除过去一线（一条线路的）一套的开关、表计、信号设备，做到简化节约。“弱电化”是指由强电改为弱电。强电一般电压较高，电流较大，对人身具有感电伤亡的危害性；弱电一般电压较低，电流较小，对人身没有危害。在电力工业中把某些发电厂及变电所中的电气控制系统改为小电流、低电压设备，就可以在电气控制系统中利用电讯方面的弱电器材，如弱电电缆、继电器、仪表等等，不但保证操作安全，而且能够节省很多有色金属及绝缘材料。“联镇化”是在电气设备的操作控制设备上安装安全操作联镇装置，可以自动控制，防止操作事故及人身事故的发生。这是保证安全生产的重要的技术措施。“操作交流化”的意思是：发电厂变电所以前大都是用蓄电池作为操作开关的电源，叫作直流操作。电力工业系统中用的电绝大多数是交流电。采取一些技术措施，补充一些简易设备后用交流电来代替蓄电池操作就叫“操作交流化”。“远动化”是在变电所安装一套遥远控制、遥远测量、遥远接受信号的设备，使职工由变电所内直接操作，变为在远离变电所的中心调度所来进行。
    推行这些新技术，给电力工业的发展带来许许多多好处。第一，能节约大量国家的建设资金。顾乡变电所推行这一新技术后，为国家节约资金达五万二千元。根据计算，按照这一经验设计变电所，可节约变电所总投资10％到15％。第二，节省建筑面积。在新建变电所推行这些新技术，可以简化建筑结构，变电所厂房可由二层楼改为平房，原来的蓄电池及充电机室及电缆线沟可以不要，主控制室的面积可以大大缩小，可节省变电所建筑总面积的40％。第三，充分挖掘控制设备潜力，节约大量的设备和器材。由于实行选线化，在控制、信号、测量设备方面采用一组设备进行集中控制，这样可以大大节约设备和器材，特别是一些稀有的有色金属。第四，节省人力，改善劳动条件。通过改革简化了控制系统，运行人员就可以在改革后的控制台上进行集中控制，而不用像过去那样到各个配电盘前去操作。过去难以维护的蓄电池等设备，也随着取消了。特别是由于实现远动化，可以大大减少运行人员的劳动强度，可以减少人员，提高劳动生产率。第五，节约运行费用。推行这些新技术，取消了蓄电池组，可以不用硫酸，节省充电机用电、仪表导线耗电损失，以及由于简化系统，可大大减少检修工作量，预计每年可节约运行维护费用五千元。第六，建设变电所可缩短工期，加快速度。据计算，采用这些新技术变电所建设工期可以缩短20％到30％。第七，操作简便，易于维护，增强了安全可靠性。通过推行这一新技术，简化了控制系统，改变了过去二次回路线路千丝万缕、密如蛛网的现象，操作更加简便，特别是实现操作控制联镇化，可以从根本上防止带负荷拉刀闸、不拆地线合闸误触电事故的发生。第八，为改革电气控制系统的设计和为电气控制设备制造部门节约原材料，开辟了新的途径。
    在这些技术改革过程中，由于党组织加强了领导，大搞群众运动，自始至终贯彻了领导干部、工人、工程技术人员三结合，生产、科学研究部门和学校相结合的方针，边学习、边设计、边施工、边试验，终于试验成功。
