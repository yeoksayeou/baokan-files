    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th dispatch from Puerto Rico: U.S. Army Secretary Brucker issued bellicose cries at the Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico on the 16th, saying that he eagerly hoped that similar large-scale threatening military exercises to the one the United States is currently holding in Puerto Rico could be held recently in Europe, and even as far as Turkey and the Far East regions like Indochina, to "test the capabilities of the U.S. Strategic Army Corps." The United States is currently continuing to airlift 20,000 paratroopers and infantrymen from its domestic bases to Puerto Rico to participate in this military exercise that already began on the 14th. American newspapers have admitted that the United States is holding this exercise in the Caribbean region primarily to pose a military threat to Cuba.
    Brucker said that he would submit a document to the U.S. Congress as "a basis for recommending further airlift exercises."

    美帝国主义唯恐天下不乱
    布鲁克叫嚣要到处进行挑衅性军事演习
    新华社17日讯　波多黎各消息：美国陆军部长布鲁克16日在波多黎各的莱迈空军基地发出好战叫嚣说，他迫切希望最近能在欧洲，甚至远至土耳其和像印度支那这样的远东地区，举行类似美国目前在波多黎各举行的那种大规模威胁性军事演习，来“测验美国战略陆军兵团的能力”。美国目前正在继续从它国内的基地上空运两万名伞兵和步兵到波多黎各，参加已经在14日开始的这次军事演习。美国报纸曾经承认，美国在加勒比海地区举行这次演习，主要是为了对古巴进行军事威胁。
    布鲁克说，他将向美国国会提出一项文件，作为“建议进一步举行空运演习的根据”。
