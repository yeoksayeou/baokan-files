Taking Grain as the Key Link and Comprehensively Developing Diversified Economy
Taiping Commune in Zhao'an County Creates a Glorious Example by Developing "Wanbao Mountain"

    This report (from our source) The members of the Taiping Commune in Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, adopting a large-scale production approach, have launched a major offensive towards barren mountains, creating a glorious example of developing "Wanbao Mountain" (Treasure Mountain) in the mountainous areas of Fujian. More than 2,500 representatives from all over the province have visited Taiping Commune to observe and learn. They unanimously praised Taiping Commune as a red flag in developing "Wanbao Mountain."

    Last year, the Taiping People's Commune, holding high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, launched a mass movement to vigorously develop the mountainous economy, focusing on ten thousand mu of forests, ten thousand mu of bamboo, ten thousand mu of fruit trees, and ten thousand mu of rapeseed. Throughout the year, they planted 15,800 mu of fruit trees, 6,100 mu of bamboo, afforested 16,100 mu, planted 22,700 mu of rapeseed, and also reclaimed 25,000 mu of barren mountains. The achievements in afforestation and fruit tree planting after communization exceeded the total of the nine years after liberation. Through the "Wanbao Mountain" development movement, the collective economy was expanded. A commune-run ten thousand mu forest and fruit farm and two jointly run commune-brigade ten thousand mu forest farms generated an income of 200,000 yuan last year alone. As the mountains, forests, and fruit trees grow, the income from the mountains will increase to 1.8 million yuan next year.

    The current large-scale development of diversified economic production in the mountainous areas has powerfully promoted the high-speed increase in grain production and has driven the comprehensive leap forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Last year, after the commune implemented land reclamation, intercropping of forests and grains, and fruit trees on the mountains, it expanded the planting of grain crops by more than 1,400 mu, increasing grain production by more than 180,000 jin. In particular, the role played by afforestation and fruit tree planting in conserving soil and water, conserving water sources, and defending against natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and wind and sand is very significant, creating extremely favorable conditions for high-speed grain production in the future. Last year, the commune began to implement pig farming in forest farms, fish farming in mountain ponds, bee keeping in forests and orchards, goose raising on mountain slopes, and sheep herding, which also found new directions for developing diversified operations in mountainous areas in the future. Due to the vigorous development of "Wanbao Mountain," the realization of the base-ization, farm-ization, and high-yield-ization of forestry and fruit production is conducive to accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification. The brigades are currently preparing to build nine new hydropower stations, vigorously build mountain roads, and promote vehicular transportation, which has also promoted the development of commune-run industries. During the large-scale land reclamation, the commune newly established thirteen blacksmith furnaces and a bamboo agricultural tool factory. In the future, with the development of bamboo, wood, and forests, it will create favorable conditions for establishing a series of commune-run industries such as green fruit, oil tea, spice, bamboo and wood processing plants, and forest product chemical plants. Developing "Wanbao Mountain" enables the commune to better support the country's socialist construction and ensure a steady increase in the income of its members. Last year, the total grain output of the commune increased by 30% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, transforming it from a grain-deficient commune to a grain-surplus commune.

    In the struggle to transform nature on a large scale, barren mountains have been transformed, and people have also been trained. Last year, in the development of "Wanbao Mountain," the commune produced twenty-eight advanced units and more than three hundred and fifty pacesetters, of whom seventy-two gloriously joined the Communist Party, and more than one hundred outstanding young people were admitted to the Communist Youth League. A number of outstanding members have also been promoted to leadership positions in the commune and brigades.

    Taiping Commune is located in the north-central part of Zhao'an, surrounded by mountains within a radius of a dozen miles, with overlapping mountain ranges, a region characterized by more people than land and more mountains than fields. The commune has nine brigades, 5,213 households, and 22,026 people, with a total of more than 20,000 mu of cultivated land, averaging less than one mu per person. There are more than 300,000 mu of mountainous land, averaging more than thirteen mu per person. For a long time, the broad masses of farmers have had a strong desire to develop towards the mountainous areas. However, this desire was only fully realized after the people's communes were established. In the past year alone, the area of land reclaimed for fruit and afforestation was one hundred times faster than during the mutual aid team period, nearly forty times faster than during the elementary cooperative period, and nearly ten times faster than during the advanced cooperative period. Among them, the 15,800 mu of fruit trees expanded exceeds the total number of fruit trees expanded during various periods after liberation, and is more than four times more than the 3,100 mu of fruit trees left over from more than 100 years before liberation. All of this fully demonstrates the enormous superiority of the people's communes. According to the characteristics of each brigade's mountainous land being suitable for forestry and fruit, coupled with the existing experience in managing forestry and fruit, the Taiping Commune, in implementing the guideline of taking grain as the key link, separately determined the focus of diversified operations. For example, Zoumatang, Baiye and other brigades focused on fruit, Xinying Brigade focused on bamboo forests, Jingkeng Brigade focused on oil tea and forest trees, and comprehensively adjusted more than 9,000 mu of interplanted mountainous land, thoroughly solving the irrational phenomena of "mountains without people to cultivate" and "people without mountains to plant" in the past. This not only makes rational use of the rich resources of mountainous areas, but also ensures the double leap forward of agriculture and forestry.

    Promoting the revolutionary pioneering spirit, seizing new directional things, and working hard are the revolutionary styles of the Taiping Commune Party Committee in leading the members to build mountainous areas at high speed. The Zhao'an County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the production of Taiping Commune and pointed out that this commune should vigorously develop towards mountainous areas and implement the policy of "taking grain as the main thing and comprehensively developing forestry and fruit production." After studying the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the Taiping Commune Party Committee immediately established a headquarters headed by the first secretary. The brigades established command posts, put forward the fighting slogan of vigorously developing "four tens of thousands" (namely ten thousand mu of forests, ten thousand mu of bamboo, ten thousand mu of fruit, and ten thousand mu of rapeseed), and inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members to build mountainous areas. After the realization of "four tens of thousands," they proposed the goal of building commune-run ten thousand mu forest and fruit farms and the slogan "where there is a forest and fruit farm, there is a pig farm." At present, eight forest and fruit farms in the commune have established pig farms. In order to organize this year's continuous leap forward, the commune Party committee proposed the goal of "eight tens of thousands" (namely ten thousand mu of tangerines, ten thousand mu of persimmons, ten thousand mu of pineapples, ten thousand mu of miscellaneous fruits, ten thousand mu of oil tea, ten thousand mu of tung oil and double ten thousand mu of bamboo and fruit), to build all the available barren mountains of the commune into a land of flowers and fruits, pigs and cattle all over the mountains, and a "Wanbao Mountain" with great harvests of grains.

    以粮为纲全面发展多种经营
    诏安县太平公社开发“万宝山”创光辉范例
    本报讯　福建省诏安县太平公社的社员们，采取大生产的方式，大举向荒山进军，创造了福建山区开发“万宝山”的光辉范例。全省各地先后前往太平公社观摩学习的代表达二千五百多人。他们一致称赞太平公社是开发“万宝山”的一面红旗。
    太平人民公社去年高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，掀起了大规模地开发山区经济，大搞万亩林、万亩竹、万亩果、万亩油菜的群众运动。全年种果一万五千八百亩，种竹六千一百亩，造林一万六千一百亩，种油菜两万二千七百亩，还开垦荒山两万五千亩。公社化后造林种果的成就，超过了解放后九年造林种果的总和。通过开发“万宝山”运动，扩大了社有经济。这个公社兴办的一个社办万亩林果场和两个社队合办的万亩林场，去年一年收入就达二十万元。随着山林、果树的成长，山林的收入明年将增加到一百八十万元。
    目前山区多种经济生产的大发展，已经有力地促进了粮食高速度的增产，并推动了农林牧副渔的全面跃进。去年全社实行开垦荒地、林粮间作和果树上山以后，扩种粮食作物一千四百多亩，增产粮食十八万多斤。特别是造林种果、保持水土、涵养水源和防御水旱风沙等自然灾害所起的作用很大，为今后高速度地增产粮食创造了极为有利的条件。去年全社开始实行林场养猪、山塘养鱼、林园养蜂、山坡养鹅和牧羊等，也为今后山区开展多种经营找到了新的方向。由于大搞“万宝山”，实现林果生产基地化、林场化、丰产化，有利于加速实现农业生产机械化、电气化。各队目前正在筹备新建九个水力站，大搞山区公路，推行车子化，也促进了社办工业的发展。在大规模开荒中，全社新办了十三处打铁炉和一个竹制农具厂。今后随着竹木林树的发展，将为举办青果、油茶、香料和竹木加工厂、林产化工厂等一系列社办工业创造有利条件。开发“万宝山”，使公社更好地支援国家社会主义建设和保证社员收入稳定地增长。去年全社粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增加30％，变缺粮社为余粮社。
    在大规模改造自然的斗争中，改造了荒山，也锻炼了人。去年全社在开发“万宝山”中出现了二十八个先进单位和三百五十多个标兵，其中有七十二人光荣地参加了共产党，一百多个优秀青年被吸收入团。还有一批优秀社员被提拔到社、队的领导岗位。
    太平公社位于诏安中北部，方圆十几里，群山环抱，山岭重叠，是个人多地少、山多田少的地区。全社九个大队，五千二百一十三户，二万二千零二十六人，共有耕地二万多亩，平均每人不到一亩。山地三十多万亩，每人平均十三亩多。长期以来，广大农民就有向山区发展的强烈愿望。但这个愿望，只有在人民公社化以后，才彻底实现了。仅去年一年，全社垦荒种果造林的面积，比互助组时快了一百倍，比初级社时快了近四十倍，比高级社时快了近十倍。其中扩种的果树一万五千八百亩，超过了解放后各个时期的扩种果树的总数，更比解放前一百多年遗留下来的三千一百多亩果树还多了四倍以上。这一切充分显示了人民公社的巨大优越性。太平公社根据各个大队山地宜林宜果的特点，加上已有的经营林果的经验，在贯彻以粮食为纲的方针下，分别确定了多种经营的重点。例如走马塘、白叶等大队以果为主，新营大队以竹林为主，景坑大队以油茶和林木为主，并全盘调整了插花山地九千多亩，彻底解决了过去“有山无人垦”和“有人无山种”的不合理的现象。这样不仅合理利用山区丰富资源，也保证了农林双跃进。
    发扬革命的首创精神，抓住方向性的新事物，大干特干，是太平公社党委领导社员高速度建设山区的革命风格。中共诏安县委研究了太平公社的生产，指出这个社应当大力向山区发展，贯彻“以粮为主全面发展林果生产”的方针。太平公社党委研究了上级党委的指示以后，立即成立了由第一书记挂帅的指挥部。大队建立了指挥所，提出了大搞“四个万”（即万亩林、万亩竹、万亩果、万亩油茶）的战斗口号，鼓舞了广大社员建设山区的热情。实现了“四个万”后，又提出大建社办万亩林果场和“哪里有林果场，那里就有养猪场”的口号。现在全社已有八个林果场办了养猪场。为了组织今年持续跃进，公社党委又提出“八个万”的奋斗目标（即万亩柑桔、万亩柿子、万亩凤梨、万亩杂果、万亩油茶、万亩油桐和双万亩竹果），把公社全部可以利用的荒山建设成花果之乡，猪牛遍山野，五谷大丰登的“万宝山”。
