Every time a new campaign or new production upsurge arrives, our broadcasting station gets especially busy. Recently, the mechanization and automation movement in the factory has unfolded vigorously. Technical innovation experts are springing up like bamboo shoots after rain. The drafts sent from each workshop are truly surprisingly numerous.

Perhaps it was because I spoke into the microphone too much during the day. That night, I returned home, lay down on the bed, and fell sound asleep. I woke up from a nap and discovered that Grandpa was still hunched over the table, writing something under the bright electric light.

Grandpa and I work in the same factory. I am a broadcaster, and he is a carpenter. Logically, he should have retired on this day last year, but he couldn't bear to put down those beloved axes and saws and remained in the carpentry workshop. Last winter, the factory launched a literacy campaign. Grandpa never let go of his literacy textbook at night, and he received a graduation certificate at the end of the year. The Party Committee even praised him as a model of excellent students, and he was even more beaming with joy. Now, he reads consolidation textbooks every night, often reading until late at night.

"Grandpa! It's almost twelve o'clock, aren't you going to sleep!" I urged him.

"You sleep, it's none of your business!" Grandpa seemed very impatient with me disturbing him.

That's just his temper: when he's free, no matter what you ask him, he'll patiently answer you. But when he's working or studying, that seriousness of his is like a university graduate student focusing intently on researching a new topic. If you say a word to him, he'll resent you. Now that he is concentrating on reviewing his lessons, I have no choice but to remain silent.

But after a while, in my drowsy state, I heard Grandpa calling my childhood name:

"Little Jinzi! Are you asleep?"

"No, Grandpa!" I opened my eyes and answered.

"Come here—if you're not asleep, get up and help me calculate a number."

This made me strange! What are we calculating in the middle of the night? I walked curiously to Grandpa's table, took a closer look, and almost cried out: he wasn't learning culture at all; he was drawing a blueprint.

"You're drawing a design!" I said in surprise.

"Our carpentry workshop processes laths slowly and laboriously. I want to mechanize it. Come, you calculate the angle for me."

I calculated a 65-degree angle for him. Grandpa squinted at it for a while, smiled, and said, "That's right, that's right, you go to sleep, I'll be done soon."

"Grandpa! If you succeed, I'll definitely write a very moving broadcast稿 for you and let everyone in the factory know," I said.

"It's a small matter, no need to make a big fuss," Grandpa said.

"A small matter? This is a great encouragement and inspiration to everyone," I said.

"If you really want to write it, you're already late. Our branch propaganda member, Little Zhang, took on this draft long ago. If there are no problems, you'll see the draft around one-thirty tomorrow afternoon, prepare your voice!" Grandpa answered me with full confidence.

The next day, there were still many drafts to be broadcast. As soon as the person who sent the draft left, another one came; before the draft on this side was finished broadcasting, a thick pile had accumulated on the other side. I looked through it, and almost every workshop and every work section in the factory had submitted稿s, but there was no draft about Grandpa's mechanization of lath processing. Seeing that it was already two o'clock in the afternoon, I was a little anxious. I handed the microphone to the broadcasting station chief, Little Guo, and ran to the carpentry workshop in one breath.

The carpentry workshop was like something incredible had happened, everywhere was filled with people, even the Party Committee Secretary had come. When I saw this scene, I understood everything.

"Everyone pay attention to safety, Master Gao's trial run of the lath processing mechanization begins!" A loud voice shouted.

After finishing speaking, I saw Grandpa press a button, and a piece of wood was simultaneously sawn into three laths; the three laths, like three arrows, shot from the machine to the open space more than three meters away.

"Good!" Everyone shouted in unison.

The Party Committee Secretary was the first to walk up to Grandpa, shook Grandpa's hand, and said, "Old comrade, congratulations!" Turning around, he said to me, "You've come at the right time, broadcast this new thing!"

"No!" I pointed to the branch propaganda member, Little Zhang, standing to the side, and said to the Party Committee Secretary, "He was going to write a broadcast稿 for Grandpa a long time ago."

"Oh! There's no need for me to write it, you've seen it with your own eyes," Little Zhang said to me with a smile, "Write and broadcast it yourself, if you don't understand anything, ask your grandpa for guidance!"

"Write and broadcast it quickly, the sooner the better!" The Party Committee Secretary said.

"Okay! I'll broadcast it right away!" Saying that, I took three steps and made them two, and ran straight to the broadcasting station. In fact, this draft had already been composed in my heart.

    给爷爷广播
    未曲
    每逢一个新的运动或新的生产高潮到来，我们广播站就特别忙。最近几天，工厂的机械化——自动化运动轰轰烈烈地展开了，技术革新能手多如雨后春笋，各车间送来的稿子真是多得惊人。
    大概是白天对着麦克风讲话多了，这天夜里我回到家里往床上一躺，便呼呼地睡着了。睡了一觉醒来发现明晃晃的电灯底下，爷爷还伏在桌子上写什么。
    我和爷爷在一个厂里工作。我是广播员，他是木工。论理，去年的今天他就该退休了，可是他舍不得撂下那些心爱的斧头锯子，仍然留在木工车间。去年冬季厂里展开了扫盲运动，爷爷晚上识字课本不离手，年末得了一张毕业证书。党委还以他作为优秀学员的典型表扬了他，他更是喜气洋洋。现在，天天晚上读巩固课本，往往一读就读到深夜。
    “爷爷！都快十二点啦，你还不睡！”我催促他。
    “你睡你的，干你啥事！”爷爷似乎很不耐烦我打扰他。
    他就是这样的脾气：闲下来时，不管你问他个啥，他都耐心回答你，可是要是在他工作和学习的时候，他那股子严肃劲，就像个大学研究生正在聚精会神地研究一项新课题，你跟他说句话，他都嫌你。现在，他正在专心地温习功课，我只好不吱声了。
    可是不一会儿，我在睡意蒙胧中听见爷爷叫着我的乳名道：
    “小金子！睡着没？”
    “没呢，爷爷！”我睁开眼睛答道。
    “来——没睡就起来，帮我算一个数。”
    这就使我奇怪了！半夜三更算什么呢？我好奇地走到爷爷的桌子边，仔细一瞅，差一点叫出了声：哪里是在学文化，原来他正在画一张图纸。
    “你在画设计图！”我惊奇地说道。
    “咱们木工车间灰条加工又慢又累人，我想给它来个机械化。来，你给我算一算角度。”
    我把一个65度的角给他算出来了。爷爷眯起眼睛看了一阵，笑着说：“对了，对了，你去睡吧，我马上就完。”
    “爷爷！你要成功了，我一定给你写篇很动听的广播稿，让全厂人都知道。”我说。
    “一点小事，用不着大吵大嚷的。”爷爷说。
    “小事？这对大伙的鼓励和启发可大啦。”我说。
    “真要写的话，你也晚了。这篇稿子咱们支部宣传委员小张早就包下了。没有什么问题的话，明天下午一点半钟左右就会见到稿子的，你准备嗓门吧！”爷爷信心十足地回答我。
    第二天，需要广播的稿子仍是多得很。送稿子的人这个刚走，那个又来了；这边的稿子还没播完，那边又积下了厚厚的一叠。我看了一遍，几乎全厂每个车间每个工段都有来稿，就是没有爷爷的灰条加工机械化的稿子。看看已是下午两点了，我有点焦急了，把麦克风交给广播站长小郭，一口气跑到木工车间。
    木工车间像发生了什么了不起的大事，到处站满了人，连党委书记也来了。我一看这情景，心里全明白了。
    “大家注意安全，高师傅的灰条加工机械化试车开始！”一个宏亮的声音喊着。
    说完，只见爷爷一按电钮，一根木方同时被锯成了三根灰条；三根灰条像三只箭，从机台射到三米多远的空地上。
    “好！”大伙同声喝采。
    党委书记第一个走到爷爷跟前，握着爷爷的手说：“老同志，祝贺你！”回头，他又对我说：“你来的正是时候，把这件新事广播出去吧！”
    “不！”我指着站在一边的支部宣传委员小张对党委书记说：“他早就要给爷爷写广播稿了。”
    “唉！这还用我写，你都亲眼看到了。”小张笑着对我说：“自编自播吧，不明白的地方，向你爷爷请教！”
    “快写快播，越快越好！”党委书记说。
    “好！我马上广播！”说着，我就三步并作两步，径直朝广播站跑去。其实，这篇稿子早就在我心里编好了。
