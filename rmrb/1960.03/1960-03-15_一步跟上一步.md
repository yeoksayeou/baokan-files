　　Step Following Step

　　The Party branch of the Guangzhou Bada Rivet Factory put forward a resounding slogan: "Use the enthusiasm for large-scale mechanization and automation to vigorously grasp the training of technical personnel." This slogan is well-proposed and timely.

　　Production activity is the activity of humans acting on the objects of labor. The objects of labor are machines, raw materials, and materials; the objects of labor are fixed and inanimate. To exert their function, they must be done through people. Therefore, people are the masters of machines and the decisive factor in production.

　　Of course, the people who play a decisive role in production are not abstract people. Taking a worker as an example, to give full play to his role in production, he must be ideologically advanced, highly conscious, and technically proficient. The fact is also true. In the mass movement of technical innovation, the comrades of workers show unparalleled political enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, which fully illustrates that only the combination of politics and technology can create great achievements in the technological revolution. The technical revolution has brought about a great leap in production. Under the new production conditions, it requires more red ideology and more specialized technology. Only red can better and faster achieve the requirements of being specialized; only being specialized can give full play to the specific role of red.

　　The example of the Guangzhou Bada Rivet Factory vividly illustrates this problem. When two automatic production lines appeared in this factory, because the workers had not had time to learn the operating technology, the automatic lines were built, but could not be put into production. However, workers who can innovate technology can master new technologies. With the spirit of continuous revolution, the workers of the Bada Rivet Factory spent only ten days or so learning the operation and maintenance technology of the automatic production lines. Of course, this does not mean that improving technology is an easy task. It is necessary to seize the work of training technical workers in time in the technical innovation movement.

　　Our era is an era of vigorous development of technological revolution, and an era of colorful new equipment and new machines. With the development of science, it is necessary to continuously improve technology, master new equipment, and move forward step by step without stopping.

    一步跟上一步
    广州市八达铆钉厂的党支部提出了一个响亮的口号：“用大搞机械化、自动化的劲头，来大抓技术力量的培训工作。”这个口号提得好，提得适时。
    生产活动，是人作用于劳动对象的活动。劳动对象就是机器、原料和材料；劳动对象是固定的没有生命的，要发挥它的作用，必须通过人。因此，人是机器的主宰，是生产中的决定性因素。
    在生产中起决定作用的人，当然不是抽象的人，以一个工人来说，要充分发挥他在生产中的作用，就要思想进步觉悟高，技术熟练。事实也正是如此，在技术革新的群众运动中，工人同志表现出无比的政治热情和无穷的智慧，就充分说明了：只有政治和技术结合，才能创造出伟大的技术革命成果。技术革命带来了生产大高涨，在新的生产条件下，就要求思想更红，技术更专，红才能更好更快地达到专的要求；专才能发挥红的具体作用。
    广州市八达铆钉厂的例子很生动地说明了这个问题。当这个厂出现了两条生产自动线以后，由于工人还没有来得及学会操作技术，自动线搞成了，却不能投入生产。但工人能革新技术，就能掌握新技术。以不断革命的精神，八达铆钉厂的工人只花了十多天的时间，就学会了生产自动线的操作和维修技术。当然，这并不是说提高技术是个轻而易举的事，一定要在技术革新运动里，及时抓紧培养技术工人的工作。
    我们的时代，是技术革命蓬勃发展的时代，是新设备新机器万紫千红的时代，随着科学的发展，就要不断提高技术，掌握新的设备，一步跟着一步不停地前进。
