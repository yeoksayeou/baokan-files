Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th March: More than a thousand displaced Overseas Chinese from West Java, concentrated in Jakarta awaiting ships to return to China, had a very pleasant day today. The Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Huang Zhen, and his wife, the Consul-General in Jakarta, Li Lansheng, and the counselors and military attachés of the Chinese Embassy, ​​visited them again at their temporary residence today. In the evening, the Consulate General in Jakarta also held a film reception for them.

More than three hundred Overseas Chinese from Cirebon live in the Jakarta Chung Hua High School. More than one hundred Overseas Chinese from this area have already returned to the motherland on the first batch of ships. This is the second batch of Overseas Chinese gathered here from Cirebon.

When Ambassador Huang Zhen and others visited these Overseas Chinese, Ou Qinglie, a fifth-generation Overseas Chinese born in Indonesia, said to the ambassador with tears in his eyes: "Only the motherland is my relative. I will take the ashes of my ancestors back and scatter them in the Chinese ocean."

Ambassador Huang Zhen and others also visited more than three hundred Overseas Chinese from Bogor, who are now living in another shelter. They visited Chen Baochang, sixty-one years old, who was lying in the ward. This old man came to Indonesia when he was twenty years old, and due to economic difficulties, he never returned home. He now has eight children and has been bedridden for many years. But he was recently forced to the point where he could not make a living and was also displaced. When Ambassador Huang Zhen went to see him, he was moved to tears. Because he was seriously ill, he pointed to his heart and mumbled his thanks.

Ambassador Huang Zhen and others also visited the Overseas Chinese who were concentrated in Jakarta from Bekasi. There were a total of one hundred and twenty-eight people, but only one hundred and seven pieces of luggage. One family of five had only one suitcase. However, their spirits were very good, and they were ready to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland after returning home.

    黄镇大使在雅加达访问候船归国华侨
    据新华社雅加达8日电　集中在雅加达候船归国的来自西爪哇的一千多名流离失所的华侨，今天度过了非常愉快的一天。中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和夫人、驻雅加达总领事李兰生、中国大使馆的参赞和武官，今天再次到他们的临时住处访问他们。晚上，驻雅加达总领事馆还为他们举行了电影招待晚会。
    来自井里汶的三百多名华侨住在雅加达中华高级中学校里。这个地区已经有一百多名华侨搭第一批轮船回到祖国。这是从井里汶聚集到这里的第二批华侨。
    黄镇大使等在访问这些华侨时，侨生在印度尼西亚的第五代老华侨欧清烈流着泪对大使说：“只有祖国才是我的亲人。我将把祖先的骨灰带回去，把它们撒在中国的海洋中。”
    黄镇大使等还访问了来自茂物、现在住在另一个收容所里的三百多名华侨。他们探望了躺在病房里的六十一岁的陈保昌。这个老人在二十岁时就来到印度尼西亚，由于经济困难，他从来没有回过家。他现在有八个孩子，自己又长年卧病不起。但是他在最近被逼得无法谋生，也遭到了流离失所的命运。当黄镇大使去看他的时候，他感动得流下了眼泪。因为身患重病，他用手指着心，喃喃而语，表示感谢。
    黄镇大使等还探望了从勿加泗集中到雅加达的华侨。他们共有一百二十八人，但是只有一百零七件行李。有一个五口之家只有一只箱子。但是，他们的精神都很好，准备回国后积极参加祖国的社会主义建设。
