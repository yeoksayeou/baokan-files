Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Currently, with the new situation of the great leap forward in production and the great development of the technical revolution in our country, the spare-time education cause for workers and peasants in our country has shown a vigorous development. Over 100 million workers and peasants across the country have participated in literacy campaigns and entered various levels and types of spare-time schools, including spare-time universities, to study. The vigorous development of spare-time education is one of the important signs that our country's cultural revolution has entered a broader and more in-depth new stage.

In recent months, the development of spare-time education for workers and peasants has been very rapid, with the number of students enrolled increasing by more than 10 million compared to the beginning of the year, and the proportion of illiterate and semi-literate people is rapidly decreasing. The railway system eliminated illiteracy for a total of 180,000 people in 1959 alone, reducing the proportion of illiterate and semi-literate people to 2%. The postal and telecommunications system can basically eliminate illiteracy this spring. The coal industry system, where the proportion of illiterate workers is relatively large nationwide, also plans to eliminate illiteracy among 90% of young and middle-aged people this year. The vast majority of illiterate and semi-literate young and middle-aged people in rural areas across the country have already been organized to enroll in schools. In Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, more than 1.07 million people are participating in spare-time primary schools, accounting for 94.3% of the number of people who should be enrolled.

While vigorously eliminating remaining illiteracy, various localities are vigorously running spare-time colleges and universities. According to statistics from Mudanjiang, Nenjiang, and Hejiang prefectures and Harbin city in Heilongjiang Province, the number of workers entering spare-time colleges and universities has doubled in just two months. In Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, 20 of the 45 larger factories and mining enterprises had established spare-time college classes by the end of February. Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Heavy Machine Tool Factory, and 14 other large enterprises in Wuhan City have established 18 spare-time colleges and universities, with a total of 32 classes. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that all industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and schools with more than 3,000 people in the city should run their own spare-time colleges and universities for workers. Units with fewer than 3,000 people should also widely carry out communist large-scale cooperation, running schools on their own, jointly running schools, or organizing workers to participate in radio and television correspondence universities and spare-time universities run by full-time colleges and universities.

Since February, industrial departments such as metallurgy, coal, petroleum, railways, post and telecommunications, and construction engineering have held employee spare-time education work conferences, symposiums, and telephone conferences to deploy this year's work. At the symposium, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry introduced the experience of a large steel plant in running a spare-time university "from scratch, starting first, then whipping the horse"; all the units present felt that there was great potential for spare-time education, liberated their thinking, and increased their confidence.

In order to promote the rapid development of employee spare-time education, many places have adopted the methods of large-scale publicity, large-scale inspections, large-scale competitions, and large-scale evaluations under the leadership of the Party committee, "comparing martial arts and comparing literature," and carrying out mass movements on a large scale; both supervising and helping, forming a high tide of learning atmosphere. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, Beijing organized a city-wide inspection of employee spare-time education. More than 20 inspection teams were organized, with nearly 2,000 people participating in the inspection. Through the methods of inspecting while solving problems and mobilizing enrollment, promoting and helping at the same time, the number of employees enrolled in the city has now increased by 130,000 compared to January, and 200,000 more than in October last year. Many areas have also organized "five-good" (good production, good study, good safety and hygiene, good unity and mutual assistance, good group management) group competitions, established pacesetters, and carried out the "learn, compare, catch up, help" movement.

Now, many large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises and some rural areas have initially formed a spare-time education system from primary schools to colleges and universities. Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory has implemented both factory-run schools and workshop-run schools, establishing an employee spare-time education system from primary schools to colleges and universities. Now, more than 80% of illiterate young and middle-aged employees have been eliminated, and 1,000 workers have entered secondary specialized schools and universities to study; 103 students from factory-run secondary specialized schools have graduated, equivalent to one-third of the graduates of secondary specialized schools assigned to the factory by the state in the past ten years. Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province has formed a complete farmer spare-time education system from primary school to university. By the end of 1957, the entire autonomous prefecture had basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged farmers, and in 1958, spare-time primary school education was universalized. Now, more than 75% of farmers in the entire autonomous prefecture have an educational level of primary school or above. Each people's commune has an average of about 30 young and middle-aged people with a college degree or college graduation degree. Spare-time education in various places implements the policy of "combining with production, unified arrangement, teaching according to aptitude, and flexibility and diversity." Units with good spare-time education, due to their close integration with production and comprehensive arrangement of production, study, and life, have generally seen the moving scene of "production leading education, education promoting production," and a double leap forward in production and education. Linqing Shipping Station in Shandong Province is responsible for river transportation tasks, with routes up to 1,000 kilometers long, and 834 employees distributed on 103 ships, with great dispersion and mobility. They adopted the method of "equipping each ship with teachers (little teachers), setting up tutoring at team stations, teaching the workers wherever they go," and running spare-time education on a large scale, so that employees under the age of 45 participated in learning. Now, the entire shipping station has eliminated illiteracy for 78% of the total number of employees, and 62.5% of the young and middle-aged employees have reached the level of graduating from senior primary school. The employee spare-time education of Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant starts from promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, improving labor productivity, and solving key production technologies. The spare-time schools in each workshop have opened lectures on the principles and structures of mechanized and automated equipment. After listening to lectures on automation and advanced tools, the workers in the gear workshop were inspired and, after collective research, realized tool automation. (Attached picture)

    我国文化革命跨入新阶段
    技术大革命带动业余教育大发展
    一亿多工农群众参加扫盲和进入各级各类业余学校学习
    据新华社22日讯　当前，随着我国生产大跃进和技术革命大发展的新形势，我国工农业余教育事业出现了一个蓬勃发展的新局面。全国有一亿多工农群众参加了扫盲和进入了包括业余高等学校在内的各级各类业余学校学习。业余教育的蓬勃发展，是我国文化革命已经跨入了一个更广泛、更深入的新的阶段的重要标志之一。
    近几个月来，工农业余教育发展很快，入学人数较年初又增加了一千多万人，文盲半文盲的比例正在迅速下降。铁道系统在1959年一年内共扫除文盲十八万人，使文盲半文盲的比例下降到2％。邮电系统今春就可以基本扫除文盲。全国职工中文盲比例较大的煤炭工业系统，今年也计划在青壮年中扫除90％的文盲。全国农村青壮年中的文盲半文盲，绝大多数已经组织入学。湖南省常德专区参加业余初等学校学习的有一百零七万多人，占应入学人数的94．3％。
    各地在大抓扫除剩余文盲的同时，正在大办业余大专学校。据黑龙江省牡丹江、嫩江、合江等专区和哈尔滨市的统计，进入业余大专学校学习的职工仅两个月就增加了一倍。河北省石家庄市四十五个较大的厂矿企业中，已有二十个厂矿企业在2月底建立起业余高等学校的班级。武汉市的武汉钢铁公司、重型机床厂等十六个大型企业办起了十八所业余大专学校，共三十二个班。中共沈阳市委决定，全市凡有三千人以上的工矿、企业、机关、学校，都要自办职工业余高等学校。三千人以下的单位，也要广泛开展共产主义大协作，进行自办、联合办，或者组织职工参加广播、电视函授大学和全日制高等学校举办的业余大学。
    2月份以来，冶金、煤炭、石油、铁道、邮电、建筑工程等产业部门都分别召开了职工业余教育工作会议、座谈会、电话会议，部署了今年的工作。冶金工业部在座谈会上介绍了一个大型钢厂“从无到有，先上马，后加鞭”的举办业余大学的经验；到会各单位一致感到业余教育大有可为，解放了思想，增强了信心。
    为了推动职工业余教育工作的迅速发展，很多地方在党委领导下采取大宣传、大检查、大竞赛、大评比的办法，“比武又比文”，大搞群众运动；既督促，又帮助，形成高涨的学习气氛。北京市在市委领导下组织了一个全市性职工业余教育大检查。组织的检查组有二十多个，参加检查的将近二千人。通过边检查，边解决问题，边发动入学，又促进又帮助的办法，现在全市职工入学人数比1月份猛增了十三万，比去年10月增多了二十万。不少地区还组织了五好（生产好、学习好、安全卫生好、团结互助好、小组管理好）小组竞赛，树立标兵，开展“学、比、赶、帮”的运动。
    现在，许多大、中型工矿企业和部分农村，已经初步形成了从初等学校到大专学校的业余教育体系。重庆江陵机器厂，实行了厂部办学和车间办学并举，建立起从初等学校到大专学校的职工业余教育体系。现在，青壮年职工中80％以上的文盲已经扫除，有一千名工人进入中等专业学校和大学学习；厂办中等专业学校有一百零三人已经毕业，相当于十年来国家分配到厂的中等专业学校毕业生的三分之一。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州已经形成从小学到大学一个完整的农民业余教育体系。1957年底，全自治州基本上扫除了农民青壮年中的文盲，1958年普及了业余小学教育。现在，全自治州75％以上的农民是小学以上的文化程度。每个人民公社平均有三十名左右大学程度和大学毕业程度的青壮年。各地业余教育贯彻执行“结合生产，统一安排，因材施教，灵活多样”的方针。业余教育搞得好的单位由于紧密结合生产，全面安排了生产、学习和生活，普遍出现了“生产带教育，教育促生产”，生产、教育双跃进的动人景象。山东临清市航运站担负河上的航运任务，航线长达一千多公里，八百三十四个职工分布在一百零三条船上，分散性和流动性很大。他们采用了“船船配教师（小先生），队站设辅导，工人到哪里，那里把书教”的办法，大办业余教育，使四十五岁以下的职工都参加了学习。现在，全航运站已经扫除了占职工总数78％的文盲，有62．5％的青壮年职工达到了高小毕业的程度。长春第一汽车制造厂的职工业余教育从推动技术革新和技术革命运动、提高劳动生产率、解决生产技术关键出发，各车间业余学校都开设了机械化、自动化设备原理与结构的讲授。齿轮工部工人在听了自动化和先进的工具讲课以后，受到启发，经集体研究后，实现了刀具自动化。（附图片）
