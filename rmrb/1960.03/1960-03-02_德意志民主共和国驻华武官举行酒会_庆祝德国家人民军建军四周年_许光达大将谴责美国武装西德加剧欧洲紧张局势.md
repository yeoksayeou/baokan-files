Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: The military attaché of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) embassy in China, Lieutenant Colonel Van Ihering, held a reception tonight to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic.

General Xu Guangda, Vice Minister of National Defense of China, attended the reception.

Lieutenant Colonel Van Ihering spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that over the past few years, our army has completed its most important task of defending the achievements of socialism. At present, the greatest danger to peace in Europe comes from the West German militarists controlled by the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism. The Adenauer government is stepping up preparations for a war of aggression using atomic weapons against the German Democratic Republic.

For several years, the government of the German Democratic Republic has put forward a series of concrete proposals for maintaining peace in Germany and understanding between Germans. The Bonn government has offered nothing but a Cold War "no." He said that in the face of the increasing danger to peace emanating from West Germany, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic decided on February 10, 1960, to establish a National Defense Council. Its task is first and foremost to effectively defend the fruits of socialism and to thwart all attacks by our enemies.

In his speech, General Xu Guangda, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended heartfelt and warm congratulations to all commanders and fighters of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic, and expressed firm support for the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the West Berlin issue. He said that in order to get rid of its isolated predicament and paralyze the fighting will of the people of the world, the U.S. ruling clique is playing tricks of false peace and real war preparations. In Europe, the United States is stepping up the arming of West Germany, using all means to revive and strengthen the German fascist militarist forces. Recently, it has even blatantly held large-scale military exercises in conjunction with the West German army, deliberately aggravating the tense situation in Europe. In Asia, the United States and Japan have signed a new military alliance treaty, preparing to arm Japan with nuclear weapons, revive Japanese militarist forces, and turn Japan into a U.S. nuclear war base in Asia. A series of facts prove that the imperialist nature of the United States has not changed and will not change. It is the main enemy of the cause of world peace and the cause of human progress.

Senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army attending the reception tonight included General Zhang Zongxun, General Li Juikui, General Chen Shiju, Lieutenant General Chen Renqi, Lieutenant General Chang Qiankun of the Air Force, Major General Wang Xinggang, and Rear Admiral Zeng Kelin.

Also invited to attend the reception was Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China.

Werning, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China also attended the reception.

    德意志民主共和国驻华武官举行酒会
    庆祝德国家人民军建军四周年
    许光达大将谴责美国武装西德加剧欧洲紧张局势
    新华社1日讯　德意志民主共和国驻我国大使馆武官范因赫德中校今晚举行酒会，庆祝德意志民主共和国国家人民军建军节四周年。
    我国国防部副部长许光达大将出席了酒会。
    范因赫德中校在酒会开始时讲话。他说，过去几年来，我们的军队完成了它的保卫社会主义成果的最重要的任务。目前对欧洲和平最大的危险来自美帝国主义侵略势力所控制的西德军国主义者。阿登纳政府正在加紧准备使用原子武器的侵略战争来反对德意志民主共和国。
    几年来，德意志民主共和国政府提出的维护德国和平和德国人之间谅解的一系列具体建议，波恩政府除了只作冷战的“不”的答复以外，别无其它。他说，面临着从西德发出的日益加剧的对和平的危险，因此德意志民主共和国人民议院才于1960年2月10日决定成立国防委员会。它的任务首先是有效地保卫社会主义的果实和制止我们敌人的一切进攻。
    许光达大将在讲话中，代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向德意志民主共和国国家人民军全体指战员致衷心的、热烈的祝贺，表示坚决支持苏联和德意志民主共和国提出的缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题的合理建议。他说，美国统治集团为了摆脱它的孤立困境和麻痹世界人民的斗志，正在玩弄假和平、真备战的花招。在欧洲，美国加紧武装西德，用一切方法复活和加强德国法西斯军国主义势力。最近更明目张胆地与西德军队联合举行大规模的军事演习，蓄意加剧欧洲紧张局势。在亚洲，美国和日本签订了新的军事同盟条约，准备用核武器武装日本，复活日本军国主义势力，把日本变成美国在亚洲的核战争基地。一系列事实证明，美国的帝国主义本性并没有改变，也不会改变，它是世界和平事业和人类进步事业的主要敌人。
    今晚出席酒会的有张宗逊上将、李聚奎上将、陈士榘上将、陈仁麒中将、常乾坤空军中将、王兴纲少将、曾克林海军少将等中国人民解放军高级将领。
    应邀出席酒会的还有我国外交部副部长曾涌泉。
    德意志民主共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办温宁和各国驻华外交使节也出席了酒会。
