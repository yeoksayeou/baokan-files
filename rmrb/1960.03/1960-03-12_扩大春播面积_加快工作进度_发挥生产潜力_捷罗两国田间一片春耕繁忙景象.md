Xinhua News Agency, Prague: Spring has arrived in Czechoslovakia. Currently, spring ploughing work has begun in Slovakia and Moravia, and other regions are actively preparing for spring ploughing.

In the states of Brno, Gottwaldov, Olomouc, and Nitra, spring ploughing and sowing are being widely carried out. Agricultural cooperatives and state farms have begun sowing spring wheat and are starting to plough the land for planting potatoes, vegetables, and feed crops. Agricultural laborers are paying close attention to seed selection, fertilization, and maintaining soil moisture this year. They are also accelerating work progress to complete this year's spring ploughing and sowing work within seven to nine days.

This year, the national cultivated land plan will increase by 18% compared to last year. In most of the large agricultural cooperatives that have been merged, spring ploughing work is organized and guided by experienced mechanics and experts sent by tractor stations, Party organizations, or people's committees to the cooperatives for a long time. Currently, several thousand outstanding cadres and experts are being transferred to rural areas to work in cooperatives or township people's committees.

To achieve self-sufficiency in feed this year, national agricultural cooperatives plan to vigorously expand the planting area of corn. Compared with last year, the national planting area of corn will increase by 80,000 hectares, totaling 500,000 hectares.

In places where sowing has not yet begun, agricultural machinery is being prepared in a timely manner. To date, the repair work of tractors and other machines nationwide has been completed by about 93%. In all agricultural cooperatives, 75% of the cooperatives already have their own machines purchased from tractor stations. Especially due to the expansion of cooperative land area after the merger of small cooperatives into large ones, this year there are better conditions to use agricultural machinery for spring ploughing and sowing.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 11th: Romanian agricultural laborers are actively carrying out spring ploughing, sowing, and water conservancy projects. The fields present a busy scene. According to statistics at the beginning of March, more than 60,000 hectares of early spring crops have been sown nationwide, and 200,000 hectares of land have been prepared and ploughed. Water conservancy projects have started in more than 100 places. The instructions recently issued by the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on carrying out spring ploughing work require all localities to seize the opportunity, sow early spring crops as soon as possible, and mobilize all agricultural machinery to carry out ploughing and preparation work simultaneously. The instructions also require all socialist agricultural units to formulate spring ploughing work plans and comprehensively arrange sowing, water conservancy construction, and tree planting.

This year, Romania's national spring sowing area will increase by more than 110,000 hectares compared to last year, totaling 6.4 million hectares. In order to increase feed, the sowing area of silage corn will be more than doubled compared to last year. The country plans to sow a total of 3.8 million hectares of corn this year. This year, intercropping will also be planted in large quantities, planting beans and melons in cornfields, in order to maximize the production potential of the land.

State farms and collective farms in various places have summarized their experience in achieving high yields last year during the winter and spring, and have formulated production plans for this year, deciding to greatly increase the yield per unit area of various crops. For example, a state farm in Timisoara State, which achieved an average yield of more than 4,600 kilograms of wheat per hectare on more than 100 hectares of land last year, plans to strive for a harvest of 6,000 kilograms of wheat per hectare this year. Collective farms in Bucharest State plan to achieve a wheat yield of 1,800 kilograms per hectare and a corn yield of 2,500 kilograms per hectare.

In order to ensure the realization of this year's high-yield plan, most of the land for spring sowing in various places has been deep-ploughed. To date, the amount of natural fertilizer applied has increased by millions of tons compared to the same period last year. Most of the corn seeds selected this year are also high-yielding hybrid varieties.

Romanian industrial departments are also enthusiastically supporting the development of agriculture. This year, agriculture will receive more than 10,000 tractors, 12,000 seeders, and many other agricultural machines. Workers at the Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory have proposed a guarantee: to produce an additional 1,000 tractors ahead of schedule this year to support the farmer brothers. This spring, the number of tractors and seeders participating in spring ploughing and sowing nationwide will increase by more than 13,000 compared to the same period last year. While carrying out spring ploughing and sowing, water conservancy projects have started in more than 100 places. This year, embankment construction and drainage work will be carried out on more than 140,000 hectares of land nationwide. In addition, the irrigated area will be increased by 64,000 hectares, increasing the country's existing irrigated area to more than 35%.

    扩大春播面积　加快工作进度　发挥生产潜力
    捷罗两国田间一片春耕繁忙景象
    捷调派大批干部下乡指导　罗工业部门增拨拖拉机支援
    新华社布拉格电　春天来到了捷克斯洛伐克大地。目前斯洛伐克和摩拉维亚地区的春耕工作已经开始，其他各地也积极展开了准备春耕的活动。
    在布尔诺、哥特瓦尔德夫、阿罗木次和尼特拉等州，春耕、春播工作正在广泛展开。农业合作社和国营农场已经开始播种春小麦，并且开始翻耕种植马铃薯、蔬菜和饲料作物的土地。农业劳动者今年非常注意选种、施肥和保持土壤水分的工作。他们还加快工作进度，争取使今年的春耕和春播工作在七天到九天内完成。
    今年全国的耕地计划比去年将增加18％。在大部分已经合并成大型的农业合作社里，春耕工作是由机器拖拉机站、党组织或人民委员会长期派到合作社去的有经验的机械师和专家组织和指导的。目前还有几千名优秀干部和专家正在调往农村，在合作社或者乡人民委员会里担任工作。
    为了今年在饲料方面做到自给自足，全国农业合作社计划大力扩大种植玉蜀黍的面积。与去年相比，全国种植玉蜀黍的面积将增加八万公顷，总共达到五十万公顷。
    在播种还没有开始的地方，正在及时准备农业机器。到目前为止，全国拖拉机和其他机器的修理工作已经完成了93％左右。在所有农业合作社中，75％的合作社已经有了从拖拉机站买来的自备的机器。特别是由于小社并大社后，合作社的耕地面积扩大，今年就具备有更好的条件来利用农业机器进行春耕和春播。
    新华社布加勒斯特11日电　罗马尼亚的农业劳动者正在积极开展春耕、春播和兴修水利等工作。田野间呈现出一片繁忙景象。据3月初统计，全国已播种了早春作物六万多公顷，整地、翻地二十万公顷。水利工程已经在一百多个地方动工。罗马尼亚农林部最近发出的开展春耕工作的指示，要求各地抓紧时机，尽快播种早春作物，动员一切农业机械，使翻地、整地工作同时进行。指示还要求各社会主义农业单位订出春耕工作计划，全盘安排播种、兴修水利和植树等工作。
    今年罗马尼亚全国的春播面积将比去年增加十一万多公顷，即总共达到六百四十万公顷。为了增加饲料，青贮玉蜀黍的播种面积将比去年增加一倍多。全国今年计划总共播种玉蜀黍三百八十万公顷。今年还要大量种植间种作物，在玉蜀黍地里栽种豆类和瓜类，以便尽量发挥土地的生产潜力。
    各地国营农场和集体农庄都在去冬今春总结了去年的丰产经验，并订出了今年的生产计划，决定大大提高各种作物的单位面积产量。例如，底密索拉州的一个国营农场，去年曾在一百多公顷土地上平均每公顷丰产四千六百多公斤小麦，今年又计划争取每公顷收获六千公斤小麦。布加勒斯特州的集体农庄计划要使每公顷小麦的产量达到一千八百公斤，玉蜀黍的产量达到二千五百公斤。
    为了保证实现今年的丰产计划，各地春播的土地绝大部分都是深耕的。到目前为止，施用的天然肥料比去年同期增加了数百万吨。今年选用的玉蜀黍种子也大半是高产的杂交品种。
    罗马尼亚工业部门也热烈支援农业的发展。今年，农业将得到一万多台拖拉机、一万二千台播种机和许多其他农业机器。恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂的工人们，已经提出保证：要在今年内超计划多生产一千台拖拉机，支援农民兄弟。今春全国参加春耕工作的拖拉机、播种机将比去年同期增加一万三千多台。在进行春耕、春播工作的同时，有一百多个地方的水利工程已经开始动工。今年全国将在十四万多公顷土地上进行筑堤和排涝工作。另外，要增加灌溉面积六万四千公顷，使全国现有的灌溉面积增加到35％以上。
