    Excavating Urban Potential to Support Agricultural Technical Transformation
    Liu Cikai, First Secretary of the CPC Jilin Municipal Committee
    
    A Brand-New Worker-Peasant Relationship
    The current agricultural technical transformation in the Jilin area is centered around semi-mechanization, with a focus on semi-mechanization and mechanization of non-field work. Over the past three months, 247 management districts in the area have basically achieved semi-mechanization or mechanization of grain processing, accounting for 28% of the total number of management districts. 180 management districts have basically achieved semi-mechanization of straw cutting, accounting for 20.5% of the total. 21 pig farms have achieved semi-mechanization of pig-raising tools. 18 management districts and 105 production teams have achieved semi-mechanization of canteen cooking equipment. At the same time, a batch of soil preparation, seeding, and rice transplanting tools have been repaired, trial-produced, and manufactured.
    In order to ensure the completion of the current agricultural technical transformation tasks and to prepare for a larger-scale technical transformation upsurge in the future, a number of agricultural machinery factories have been newly built and expanded throughout the area. Since the Municipal Party Congress, three new county-run machinery factories and thirteen commune-run machinery repair and manufacturing plants have been built, with an increase of 63 various machine tools. Now there are 71 county and commune machinery factories in the area, with 273 lathes. The counties have trained more than 1,600 tractor drivers, repair workers, and various technical workers, and have raised more than 12.3 million yuan in agricultural technical transformation funds.
    The realization of agricultural modernization is not only the strong desire of the broad masses of farmers, but also the urgent requirement of the urban people, especially the working masses. The importance of agriculture and agricultural modernization is easily understood by the broad masses. Most workers come from rural areas, and they have deep feelings for the countryside. They say, "We come from the countryside, our homes are in the countryside, and supporting agricultural production is supporting our brothers; moreover, this is the glorious task of our working class." Many workers use waste materials to make tools and equipment for the countryside in their spare time. Some workers, during their days off, bring tools and ride bicycles to communes to help repair farm tools or machinery. Their slogan is "Spend Sundays in the communes." Staff and workers in finance and trade departments, teachers and students in schools, and street residents all do their best to actively support agricultural technical transformation. At present, supporting agricultural technical transformation has become a mass movement in Jilin City.
    Because cities vigorously support the countryside and industry vigorously supports agriculture, the relationship between urban and rural workers and peasants has become closer, and the worker-peasant alliance has developed on a new basis. It has become a common practice for workers and peasants to organize delegations to visit each other. Since the Third Municipal Party Congress, the districts and factories in the city alone have organized 191 delegations to visit communes. Through these visits, feelings have been strengthened, information has been communicated, and mutual support has been actively and voluntarily provided. This is a gratifying phenomenon.
    Factory-Commune Hookups Promote Agriculture and Drive Industry
    Vigorously publicizing and implementing the Party Central Committee's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and industry as the service of agriculture is the main reason why the mass movement for accelerating agricultural technical transformation in the Jilin area has been able to develop rapidly and widely.
    Jilin area has a large urban population and a large proportion of industry. In 1959, the total industrial output value accounted for 84.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The future industrial production and construction tasks are still very arduous, which requires a greater increase in agricultural production, a greater improvement in labor productivity and commodity rates, to provide industry with more raw materials and labor, and to supply cities with more grain and non-staple foods, so that the development of agriculture and the development of industry are more compatible. However, in the development of agricultural production, there is a prominent contradiction, that is, the shortage of labor. Under the new historical conditions, in order to solve this contradiction, in addition to properly arranging production and labor and further inspiring the labor enthusiasm of the masses, an important way is to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, gradually change the backward state of agricultural technology, and combine the masses' soaring enthusiasm with modern science and technology to increase labor productivity by several times or even several times or dozens of times.
    The conditions for realizing agricultural technical transformation in the Jilin area are very good. Jilin City is a heavy industrial city centered on the chemical industry and the electric power industry. The machinery industry and the petroleum industry also have a certain foundation, and a small-scale iron and steel complex has been initially established. By fully utilizing the potential of these enterprises, a large amount of equipment, technical force, and materials can be provided for agricultural technical transformation. A large proportion of industry not only puts higher demands on agriculture, but also makes it possible to give agriculture greater assistance. Our task is to strengthen leadership in this regard, make full use of favorable conditions, and turn objective possibilities into reality.
    Since the Municipal Party Congress, the enthusiasm of industrial enterprises in Jilin City to support agriculture has been very high, basically achieving "active hookup, door-to-door support, doing what one can, and responding to every request." The machinery industry in the area is stepping up the manufacture of various farm tools and agricultural machinery. Enterprises that undertake the task of supporting the construction of the whole country and the whole province also squeeze out some strength to produce farm tools and machinery for the region without affecting the original production tasks. Many enterprises have trained various technical workers for the communes, and on the principle of equal value exchange, they have supported the rural areas with some surplus or old equipment, tools, and materials without affecting production. Some enterprises have increased new products or new construction projects to meet the needs of agricultural technical transformation. What is particularly important is that many enterprises actively help counties and communes develop industry. According to the statistics of thirty-two units, it is planned to help counties and communes build 51 factories of various kinds within this year (including 34 machinery factories and 6 chemical factories), and 16 factories have been basically completed. After these factories are all completed and put into production, they will play an important role in accelerating agricultural technical transformation. To help the development of county-run industry and commune-run industry from the aspects of design, equipment, and technical force is the main direction of industrial support for agriculture in the future.
    Industrial support for agriculture is also a great impetus to industry itself. Last year, the city's industry achieved a complete success, and this year it has achieved a good start and a red first month. This shows that the Party Central Committee's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry supporting agriculture is completely correct. Implementing this policy has not only promoted agriculture but also driven industry.
    Grasp Semi-Mechanization and Gradually Realize Agricultural Mechanization
    The realization of agricultural technical transformation is a great and arduous historical task. In order to complete this task quickly, it is necessary to adhere to the Party's general line of socialist construction and the policy of "walking on two legs."
    The realization of agricultural technical transformation must be active, but it must be gradual, starting from realistic conditions, combining indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, from less to more. This has been clearly pointed out at the Municipal Party Congress. However, some comrades have not well understood and implemented the "walking on two legs" policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, attaching importance to foreign methods and neglecting indigenous methods, being greedy for high standards and grand scale. They said "no cattle are used for ploughing", so they asked the upper levels for tractors; they said "no oil is used for lighting lamps", so they demanded to install electric lights, but they did not actively do it themselves. As a result, they failed to achieve high standards and could not settle for lower ones, and the progress of the movement was very slow and the effect was very small. At the agricultural technical transformation work conference held by the Municipal Party Committee in mid-January, the idea of attaching importance to foreign methods and neglecting indigenous methods was emphatically criticized, and it was pointed out that the important goal of agricultural technical transformation is to improve labor productivity and develop agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to combine indigenous and foreign methods, and start from indigenous methods. At present, the main task is to promote new-style farm tools and improve old farm tools, and strive to basically realize semi-mechanization this year. Because of the criticism of the idea of attaching importance to foreign methods and neglecting indigenous methods, the reform of non-field operation tools in the whole region has made great progress in the past month.
    It is entirely possible for agriculture in the Jilin area to basically realize semi-mechanization this year. In terms of field operations, the degree of semi-mechanization had already reached 31.7% in 1959. This year, a large number of new-style horse-drawn farm tools have been arranged for production, plus the mobilization of the masses to improve old-style farm tools, the degree of semi-mechanization can be increased by about one time. The semi-mechanization and mechanization level of non-field operations is low, but the conditions are very good. In addition to improving existing tools, the city has 40,000 horsepower of power machinery existing and newly added this year. These power are used for irrigation and drainage for only three months, and the remaining nine months can be used for non-field operations. The mechanization of non-field operations can be realized earlier than field operations. According to preliminary calculations, the basic realization of semi-mechanization in the whole area can save about 100,000 labors, so that the shortage of labors this year can be basically solved. Mechanization is the key to agricultural technical transformation. At present, we must first grasp semi-mechanization, implement the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and create conditions for agricultural mechanization. Therefore, we regard semi-mechanization as the center of the current agricultural technical transformation and carry out our work closely around this center.
    The vigorous support of industrial departments is an indispensable condition for realizing agricultural technical transformation. However, the support of industry is also limited to a certain extent at present. Therefore, we mainly rely on the masses, use local materials, and rely on our own efforts. For a period of time, there was a phenomenon of passively relying on the support of industrial departments in some places, and we corrected it in time. We believe that we must emphasize self-reliance in the countryside and emphasize vigorous support in the city. Combining these two aspects can greatly accelerate the speed of agricultural technical transformation.
    Contracting Areas, Contracting Tasks, Contracting to the End
    To realize agricultural technical transformation, like completing other tasks, we must adhere to putting politics in command, strengthening Party leadership, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale.
    The Party committee must strengthen its leadership over agricultural technical transformation. This is because, on the one hand, the realization of agricultural technical transformation is a fundamental measure to develop agricultural production and an extremely important task. On the other hand, the realization of agricultural technical transformation is an arduous and complex work, involving many aspects and many departments. Without the Party's strengthening of leadership, it is impossible to mobilize the strength of the whole Party and the whole people to complete this major and arduous task.
    In order to strengthen leadership, the city, county, and commune have established agricultural technical transformation committees or leading groups, with the secretary personally in charge, and have special institutions or personnel responsible for daily work. The management district and production team are responsible by a director, captain, or Party branch secretary. Industrial and mining enterprises have also universally established special institutions to support agricultural technical transformation. The city, county, commune, and larger factories and mines have all formulated long-term plans and current action plans for agricultural technical transformation. With the unified leadership and planning of the Party committee, agricultural technical transformation has been carried out rapidly in an organized and planned manner. In order to enable industry to better support agriculture, the Municipal Party Committee has also specifically divided the counties and communes responsible for industrial and mining enterprises and urban areas to support, and implemented "contracting areas, contracting tasks, and contracting to the end." This has played a great role in industry's planned support for agriculture.
    To realize agricultural technical transformation, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. To reform and create, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, to promote and use, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses, and materials and funds need to be solved by the vast masses. Without fully mobilizing the masses, improved tools and new tools cannot appear in large quantities, and the success of the reform cannot be universally promoted. The current agricultural technical transformation movement centered on semi-mechanization has been carried out well, which is the result of carrying out mass movements on a large scale under the leadership of the Party.
    In terms of carrying out mass movements on a large scale, some places have already achieved very good experience. That is: put forward specific goals and action slogans in a certain period, concentrate the leadership and the strength of the masses to reform certain tools, quick decision and quick action, fight annihilation wars; cultivate typical examples, make examples, and spread and promote them in a timely manner by organizing visits and holding on-site meetings; carry out competitions, regularly check and compare, and announce the results, and hold representative conferences of advanced units in agricultural technical transformation, exchange experiences, and reward and commend; fully mobilize the masses, pay special attention to mobilizing blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons, and combine leading cadres, "three craftsmen", and the masses. Kouqian People's Commune in Yongji County did this. Under the direct help of the county party committee, they made pilots of improving grinders, mills and promoting chaff cutters in late December last year, and promoted it by holding on-site meetings after success. Each management district organized "three craftsmen", and under the leadership of leading cadres and the participation of the masses, they reformed, installed grinders, mills and chaff cutters in a concentrated way. Competitions were also carried out between the management districts. When the movement formed a climax, the commune party committee checked and compared every day. After rice milling, flour milling, and chaff cutting basically realized semi-mechanization, on the one hand, it expanded the results, and on the other hand, it conducted pilots of reforming pig raising tools and cooking tools, and actively organized the next battle.
    To arouse enough attention from leading cadres at all levels and to fully mobilize the masses, the key lies in doing thorough ideological work. According to our experience, calculating three accounts - task accounts, labor accounts, and semi-mechanization efficiency accounts is a very effective education method. By calculating these three accounts, the understanding of the importance of realizing semi-mechanization has been improved, and the direction of tool reform has been clarified. Wherever this is done, the effect is very good.

    挖掘城市潜力支援农业技术改造
    中共吉林市委第一书记　刘慈恺
    崭新的工农关系
    吉林地区当前的农业技术改造，是以半机械化为中心，又以非田间工作的半机械化、机械化为重点的。在这三个多月当中，全地区有二百四十七个管理区基本实现了粮米加工半机械化或机械化，占全部管理区总数的28％；有一百八十个管理区基本实现了铡草半机械化，占全部管理区总数的20．5％；有二十一个养猪场实现了养猪工具半机械化；有十八个管理区和一百零五个生产队实现了食堂炊具半机械化。同时，还检修、试制和生产了一批整地、播种和插秧工具。
    为了保证完成当前的农业技术改造任务，并且为今后更大规模的技术改造高潮做好准备，全地区新建和扩建了一批农业机械厂。从市党代表大会以后，新建县营机械厂三个，公社营机械修造厂十三个，增加各种机床六十三台。现在全地区共有县、社机械厂七十一个，车床二百七十三台。各县培训了拖拉机手、修理工和各种技术工人一千六百多名，筹集农业技术改造资金一千二百三十多万元。
    实现农业现代化，不仅是广大农民的强烈愿望，同时也是城市人民，尤其是工人群众的迫切要求。农业和农业现代化的重要性，是很容易为广大群众所理解的。大部分工人出身于农民，他们对农村有着深厚的感情。他们说：“我们来自农村，家在农村，支援农业生产就是支援我们的兄弟；何况这又是咱们工人阶级的光荣任务哩。”许多工人在业余时间用废旧物资给农村制造工具、设备。有些工人在公休的时候，带着工具、骑着自行车，到公社帮助修理农具或机械，他们的口号是“到公社去过星期天。”财贸部门的职工，学校的师生以及街道居民，都尽其所能积极支援农业技术改造。目前，支援农业技术改造，已经成为吉林市的全民运动了。
    由于城市大力支援农村，工业大力支援农业，城、乡工农之间的关系更加密切了，工农联盟在新的基础上有了新的发展。工人和农民组织代表团互相参观访问已经形成风气。从市第三次党代表大会以后，仅市内各区和工厂就组织了一百九十一个代表团到公社访问，通过参观访问密切了感情，沟通了情况，积极主动地互相支援。这是一种可喜的气象。
    厂社挂钩促进农业  带动工业
    大力宣传、贯彻执行党中央确定的国民经济以农业为基础和工业为农业服务的方针，这是吉林地区加速实现农业技术改造的群众运动能够迅速地、广泛地开展起来的主要原因。
    吉林地区城市人口多，工业比重大，1959年的工业总产值占工农业总产值的84．7％。今后的工业生产任务和建设任务仍然很艰巨，这就要求农业生产要有更大的增长，劳动生产率和商品率要有更大的提高，为工业提供更多的原料和劳动力，供应城市更多的粮食和副食品，使农业的发展和工业的发展更相适应。但是，在农业生产的发展中，有一个突出的矛盾，即劳动力不足。在新的历史条件下，为了解决这一矛盾，除了妥善地安排生产和劳动力以及进一步鼓舞群众的劳动热情以外，很重要的一条是加速进行农业的技术改造，逐步改变农业技术的落后状态，把群众的冲天干劲和现代科学技术结合起来，成倍以至几倍几十倍地提高劳动生产率。
    吉林地区实现农业技术改造的条件是很好的。吉林市是以化学工业和电力工业为中心的重工业城市，机械工业和石油工业也有一定的基础，小型钢铁联合企业已经初步建立起来。充分发挥这些企业的潜力，可以为农业技术改造提供大量的设备、技术力量和物资。工业比重大，既对农业提出了更高的要求，又有可能给农业以更大的援助。我们的任务是要加强这方面的领导，充分运用有利条件，把客观可能性变成现实。
    市党代表大会以后，吉林市工业企业支援农业的积极性是很高的，基本上做到了“主动挂钩，支援上门，力所能及，有求必应”。全地区机械工业加紧制造各种农具和农业机械。担负支援全国、全省建设任务的企业，在不影响原来生产任务的前提下，也挤出一部分力量为本地区生产农具和机械。很多企业为公社培训出各种技术工人，并且在不影响生产的条件下，按着等价交换的原则，把一部分多余的或者废旧的设备、工具和材料，支援给农村。有些企业为了适应农业技术改造的需要，增加了新产品或新的建设项目。特别重要的是，不少企业积极帮助县和公社发展工业。据三十二个单位的统计，计划在今年内帮助县、公社建设各种工厂五十一个（其中机械厂三十四个，化工厂六个），有十六个工厂已经基本建成。这些工厂全部建成并投入生产以后，对加速农业的技术改造将起重要的作用。从设计、设备，技术力量等方面帮助县营工业和公社工业的发展，是今后工业支援农业的主要方向。
    工业支援农业，对工业本身也是一个极大的推动。去年全市工业实现了满堂红，今年又实现了开门红和首月红。这说明党中央以农业为基础、工业支援农业的方针是完全正确的。贯彻执行这一方针，既促进了农业，又带动了工业。
    抓住半机械化逐步实现农业机械化
    实现农业的技术改造，是一个伟大而艰巨的历史任务。为了迅速地完成这一任务，必须坚持贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针。
    实现农业技术改造必须是积极的，但又必须是逐步的，要从现实的条件出发，土洋并举，由土到洋，由少到多。这在市党代表大会上就已经明确地指出了。但是，有些同志却没有很好地领会和贯彻执行土洋并举的“两条腿走路”方针，重洋轻土，贪高图大。说“耕地不用牛”，他们就向上边要拖拉机；说“点灯不用油”，他们就要求给安电灯，可是自己却不积极去做。结果是高不成，低不就，运动的进展很慢，效果很小。市委在1月中旬召开的农业技术改造工作会议上，着重批判了重洋轻土的思想，强调指出：农业技术改造的重要目标是提高劳动生产率，发展农业生产。因此，必须土洋并举，土洋结合。各地要根据具体条件，能洋则洋，能土则土，从洋着眼，从土着手。当前，主要是推广新式农具和改良旧农具，争取在今年内基本实现半机械化。由于批判了重洋轻土的思想，近一个月来，全区非田间作业工具的改革，有了很大的进展。
    吉林地区的农业在今年基本实现半机械化是完全可能的。在田间作业方面，1959年半机械化程度已经达到31．7％，今年已经安排了大批新式马拉农具的生产，再加上发动群众改良旧式农具，半机械化程度可以提高一倍左右。非田间作业的半机械化和机械化水平较低，但是条件甚好。除了改良现有工具以外，全市现有和今年新增加的动力机械有四万马力，这些动力用于排灌的时间仅有三个月，其余九个月可用于非田间作业。非田间作业的机械化，可以比田间作业更早地实现。初步计算，全地区基本实现半机械化，可以节省大约十万名劳动力，这样，今年所缺的劳动力就能基本解决。机械化是农业技术改造的纲，当前，要首先抓住半机械化，实行土洋并举，为农业机械化创造条件。因此，我们把半机械化作为当前农业技术改造的中心，紧紧地围绕这一中心来开展工作。
    工业部门的大力支援是实现农业技术改造必不可少的条件。但是，工业的支援当前也有一定限度。因此，主要还是依靠群众，就地取材，自力更生。有一个时期，有些地方有消极依赖工业部门支援的现象，我们及时地纠正了。我们认为，在农村必须强调自力更生，在城市必须强调大力支援，把这两方面结合起来，就可以大大加快农业技术改造的速度。
    包地区、包任务、一包到底
    实现农业技术改造和完成其他任务一样，必须坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。
    党委必须加强对农业技术改造的领导。这是因为，一方面，实现农业技术改造是发展农业生产的一项根本性的措施，是一项极端重要的任务，另一方面，实现农业技术改造又是一项艰巨复杂的工作，涉及好多方面，好多部门，党不加强领导，就不能调动全党全民的力量，完成这一重大而又艰巨的任务。
    为了加强领导，市、县、公社都成立了农业技术改造委员会或领导小组，由书记亲自挂帅，设有专门机构或专人负责日常工作。管理区、生产队由一名主任、队长或者党支部书记负责。工矿企业也普遍建立了支援农业技术改造的专门机构。市、县、公社和较大的厂矿，都制订了农业技术改造的长远规划和当前的行动计划。有了党委的统一领导和规划，农业技术改造就有组织、有计划地迅速开展起来。为了使工业更好地支援农业，市委还具体划分了工矿和城区负责支援的县、社，实行“包地区、包任务、一包到底”。这对工业有计划地支援农业起了很大的作用。
    实现农业技术改造必须充分地发动群众。改革创造要发动群众，推广使用也要发动群众，材料、资金更需要广大群众想办法解决。不把群众充分地发动起来，改良工具和新工具就不能大量出现，改革成功也不能普遍推广。这次以半机械化为中心的农业技术改造运动开展的较好，就是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动的结果。
    在大搞群众运动方面，有些地方已经取得了很好的经验。这就是：在一定时期提出具体的奋斗目标和行动口号，集中领导和群众的力量改革某几种工具，速战速决，打歼灭战；培养典型，做出样子，通过组织参观和召开现场会议，及时传播、推广；开展竞赛，定期检查评比，公布战果，并且召开农业技术改造先进单位代表大会，交流经验，奖励、表扬；全面发动群众，特别注意发动铁匠、木匠、石匠，领导干部、“三匠”、群众三结合。永吉县口前人民公社就是这样作的。他们在县委的直接帮助下，去年12月下旬作了改良碾子、磨和推广铡草机的试点，成功以后，召开现场会议推广。各管理区都把“三匠”组织起来，在领导干部挂帅、群众参加下，突击改革，安装碾子、磨和铡草机。各管理区互相之间还开展了竞赛。在运动形成高潮的时候，公社党委每天都检查评比。碾米、磨面、铡草基本实现半机械化以后，一方面扩大战果，一方面进行改革养猪工具和炊事工具的试点，积极组织下一个战役。
    要引起各级领导干部的足够重视和把群众充分发动起来，关键在于做透思想工作。根据我们的经验，算三笔账——任务账、劳动力账、半机械化效率账是一种很有成效的教育方法。通过算这三笔账，既提高了干部和群众对实现半机械化重要性的认识，又明确了工具改革的方向。凡是这样做的地方，效果都很好。
