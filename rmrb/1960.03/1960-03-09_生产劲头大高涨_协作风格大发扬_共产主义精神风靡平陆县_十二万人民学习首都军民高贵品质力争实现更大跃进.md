Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th: The 120,000 people of Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, have launched a mass study movement to learn from the communist spirit of the people of the capital in rescuing poisoned migrant workers in Pinglu. The people of the entire county have received a vivid communist education, which has powerfully promoted the continued leap forward in current work.

When the medicines supported by the people of the capital arrived in Pinglu, the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately reported this news to the people of the whole county through wired broadcasting, and called on the people of the whole county to learn from the noble qualities of the people of the capital through telephone conferences and the issuance of two written notices. Hao Shishan, the first secretary of the county party committee, made a report to two thousand cadres, teachers, students, and factory and mine workers. The Pinglu County Newspaper and wired broadcasting station published and broadcast a large number of relevant news and articles, and 1,200 blackboards and 1,850 loudspeakers used quick板 [bǎn, a clapper instrument] and poems to publicize to the masses. Theatrical troupes and amateur theatrical troupes have performed dramas about the people of the capital rescuing the Pinglu migrant workers' poisoning incident to the masses 650 times. The people of the whole county generally studied the relevant news and articles published in the People's Daily, China Youth Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Shanxi Daily, and Jinnan Daily, and timely organized listening to the broadcasts of the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station. At the same time, full discussions were held, everyone expressed opinions, everyone talked about views, and challenged each other to express determination. Sixty-five thousand people in the county wrote letters of determination and big-character posters, determined to thank the Party and Chairman Mao with practical actions, and thank the support of the people of the capital.

The noble style of the people of the capital touched the hearts of everyone in the county, especially the sixty-one poisoned migrant workers, all of whom were moved to tears and full of energy. They all said that the people of the capital sent us "elixir" by plane, which brought us back to life from the brink of death. The Party is our reborn parent, our second father and mother. After they recovered their health, they immediately joined the battle, and the amount of earth dug by each person per day increased from five cubic meters to fourteen cubic meters. Their slogan is: "New life, new vigor, one person's work is equivalent to ten people's, complete three days' task in one day, and present gifts three months in advance." Three thousand road construction migrant workers on the Fengnan Highway launched a "six comparisons" and "six looks" competition, that is, compare energy and look at achievements, compare thought and look at awareness, compare safety and look at accidents, compare tools and look at storage, compare innovation and look at work efficiency, and compare tasks and look at completion. Wang Sanbang, a migrant worker in Zhangcun Management District, created a kind of soil explosive after three days of research, which is equivalent to the power of yellow explosives and reduces the cost by four times, saving the country 3,200 yuan in wealth.

Inspired by the communist style of the people of the capital, the employees of the industrial and commercial sectors immediately improved their service attitude, fully supported drought resistance, implemented large-scale inventory clearance, large-scale repair and assembly, and large-scale installation, and took out more than 400 horsepower of power machinery, 38 water pumps, 230 rubber hoses, 14 tons of cement, and more than 1,000 waterwheel parts. Shop assistants carried goods to the fields to serve the masses; county-run and commune-run factories (farms) rushed to make water-lifting tools for drought resistance. 726 workers in the county went to the fields to help commune members repair drought-resistant tools. After studying the deeds of the air force fighters breaking through clouds and fog to save loved ones, the militia of the whole county achieved a double victory in production and military training. Government cadres have asked to go to the countryside to support drought resistance. At present, 1,200 cadres and masses in the county eat, live, and work together; 45,000 people have participated in drought resistance and wheat irrigation activities. Under the slogan of "Break Conservatism, Boost Energy, and Vow to Win a Great Wheat Harvest," they built 767 canals, dug 963 springs, and dug 330 wells in ten days. The 370,000 mu of wheat in the county have generally been watered once.

Now, this mass study movement has been extended to the Jinnan Special Zone where the county is located. Recently, the Jinnan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially issued a notice calling on the people of the whole region to deeply study the great class friendship and lofty communist style of the capital's military and civilians in rescuing the migrant workers of Pinglu County.

    生产劲头大高涨　协作风格大发扬
    共产主义精神风靡平陆县
    十二万人民学习首都军民高贵品质力争实现更大跃进
    新华社太原8日电　山西省平陆县十二万人民，展开了一个群众性的学习运动，学习首都人民抢救平陆中毒民工的共产主义风格。全县人民受到了一次生动的共产主义教育，有力地促进了当前各项工作继续跃进。
    当首都人民支援的药品到达平陆以后，中共平陆县委立即通过有线广播，向全县人民报告了这一消息，并且通过电话会议和发出两次书面通知，号召全县人民学习首都人民的高贵品质。县委第一书记郝世山，向两千名机关干部、学校师生和厂矿职工作了报告。平陆县报和有线广播站大量刊登和广播有关消息和文章，并有一千二百块黑板报、一千八百五十个广播筒用快板、诗歌向群众进行宣传。剧团和业余剧团已向群众演出首都人民抢救平陆民工中毒事件的戏剧六百五十场。全县人民普遍学习了人民日报、中国青年报、大公报、山西日报、晋南报刊载的有关消息和文章，及时组织收听了中央人民广播电台、山西人民广播电台的广播。同时进行了充分的讨论，人人发议论，个个讲看法，互相挑战表决心。全县有六万五千人写了决心书、大字报，决心以实际行动感谢党和毛主席，感谢首都人民的支援。
    首都人民高贵的风格，激动了全县每一个人的心，特别是六十一位中毒的民工，无不激动得热泪盈眶，无不干劲冲天。他们都说，首都人民派飞机给我们送来了“灵丹”，使我们死里重生，党是我们的重生父母，再生爹娘。他们在恢复健康后，立即投入了战斗，每天每人挖土由五方增加到十四方。他们的口号是：“新生命新干劲，一人干活顶十人，三天任务一天完，提前三月把礼献”。风南公路三千名修路民工开展了“六比”“六看”竞赛运动，即比干劲看成绩、比思想看觉悟、比安全看事故、比工具看保管、比革新看工效、比任务看完成。张村管区民工王三帮，经过三天钻研，创造一种土炸药，相当于黄色炸药的威力，成本降低四倍，为国家节约财富三千二百元。
    工商业部门的职工，在首都人民共产主义风格的鼓舞下，立即改进服务态度，全力支援抗旱，实行大清库、大修配、大安装，共拿出四百多马力的动力机械，三十八台水泵，二百三十根胶管，十四吨水泥，一千多件水车零件。商店营业员担货下田为群众服务；县营和社营工厂（场）为抗旱赶制提水工具。全县有七百二十六个工人到田间帮助社员检修抗旱工具。全县民兵学习了空军战士穿云破雾救亲人的事迹后，取得了生产和练武双胜利。机关干部纷纷要求下乡支援抗旱。目前，全县有一千二百名干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动；有四万五千人投入抗旱浇麦活动。他们在“破保守鼓干劲誓夺小麦大丰收”的口号下，十天修渠七百六十七条，挖泉九百六十三处，打井三百三十个，全县三十七万亩小麦普遍浇过了一次水。
    现在，这个群众性的学习运动，已经扩展到这个县所在的晋南专区。最近中共晋南地委曾专门发出通知，号召全区人民深入学习首都军民抢救平陆县民工的伟大的阶级友爱精神和崇高的共产主义风格。
