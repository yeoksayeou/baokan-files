Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 12th: An agricultural technology innovation movement centered on the reform of spring plowing tools has been vigorously launched in Zhejiang. The tool reform work in various regions not only started earlier than in previous years, but also paid attention to complete sets. As of February 23, the province had repaired 8.64 million pieces of various spring plowing farm tools and newly manufactured 14.2 million pieces. In terms of cultivation, double-wheel double-furrow plows, East China paddy field plows, improved deep plowing plows, and soil crushing harrows have been widely promoted. Huangyan, Pinghu, Changxing, and Haining counties have achieved the use of new-style deep plowing plows for all their fields. In terms of sowing and transplanting, various regions are vigorously promoting the "Zhejiang No. 1" rice transplanter, as well as cotton nutrient pot presses and ramie seeders. In terms of irrigation and drainage, water pumps are being actively promoted. Other tools, such as livestock production tools and canteen cooking utensils, are also undergoing comprehensive innovation.

Various regions have strengthened leadership over the technical innovation movement. For example, the Ningbo Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to comprehensively and systematically innovate tools, recently gathered 69 types and more than 200 pieces of complete sets of advanced tools from five major categories—rice, cotton, animal husbandry, cooking, and special products—from all over the region, and the responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee and the Prefectural Committee's new-style tool appraisal team jointly appraised them. After the meeting, various regions actively promoted them. Currently, the entire prefecture has promoted 33,681 improved deep plowing plows; more than 5,000 pig farms have achieved simple mechanization and semi-mechanization of feed processing, as well as gravity flow of water and transportation of materials by vehicles and ships, and cooking with Wanling stoves. More than 3,000 public canteens have realized cutting vegetables without knives, fetching water without carrying, and cooking rice using Wanling stoves, reducing a large number of logistical labor and supporting spring plowing production.

At present, the agricultural technology innovation movement in various parts of the province is constantly advancing. In order to ensure that all new-style tools are put into use, various regions have also adopted a series of organizational measures. The Jinhua Prefecture promoted the "fixed-point station construction, centralized use" method of the Tonglu County double-furrow plow and East China paddy field plow. The entire prefecture has established 309 double-furrow plow stations in 113 communes. Each livestock farm in the Ningbo Prefecture has established specialized teams (groups) for feed production, transportation, feeding, and infrastructure construction according to the needs of using new-style tools, rationally dividing labor and implementing assembly line operations.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 11th: The broad masses of emancipated peasants in Tibet are enthusiastically launching farm tool reform activities, determined to eliminate the backward state of cultivation with wooden plows and wooden hoes left over from the feudal serf system.

At present, the democratic reform in Tibet's rural areas has achieved great victories, and a high tide of spring plowing production is being set off everywhere. In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, the broad masses of peasants generally demand intensive cultivation to increase yield per unit area and get rid of the shackles of backward farm tools as soon as possible. They say: We cannot rely on "man-carrying baskets," "two oxen lifting the bar," and "wooden plows and wooden hoes" to achieve a large increase in agricultural production.

According to the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants to improve production, Party organizations at all levels in Tibet have led the masses to launch a vigorous farm tool reform movement since the beginning of this year. In just over two months, the entire region has manufactured dozens of types and tens of thousands of improved farm tools and new-style farm tools, including tampers, sluice gates, steel drills, iron hoes, iron shovels, iron picks, carts, handcarts, carrying baskets, iron plows, iron plowshares, wooden tooth harrows, wooden strip harrows, and water mills for water conservancy, and gradually changed the two oxen lifting the bar to one ox rope set plow traction, as well as hoes, rakes, sickles, threshing rollers for threshing, windmills for winnowing grain, and soil presses for oil pressing. These newly emerging tools in Tibet have played an extremely good role in spring plowing production. The peasants said with great joy when using these new farm tools: In the past, the serf owners regarded us as "talking tools," only whipped and enslaved us, and plundered all our labor results with Ula corvee and exorbitant taxes, but never cared about production; now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have turned over, become masters, and also lead us to reform tools and engage in large-scale production; this year's bumper harvest is even more guaranteed.

In the farm tool reform movement, the broad masses of peasants in Tibet firmly listened to the Party's words, closely relied on the strength of the masses, and adopted the principle of obtaining materials locally and reforming them locally; at the same time, they solved the material and technical problems by studying, learning, manufacturing, experimenting, and popularizing simultaneously. Linzhi, Mozhugongka, Naidong, Jiangda and other counties concentrated iron and woodworkers to form many farm tool reform groups, and the Party secretaries personally took charge, and promoted one piece as soon as it was successfully manufactured; or concentrated the well-reformed farm tools from various townships and villages, held on-site observation meetings, ran technical training classes, and mobilized the masses to do it together, so that the farm tool reform movement continued to move forward.

    加快春耕速度　提高春耕质量
    浙江全面成套革新春耕农具
    西藏农民积极改革农具改变木犁木锄耕作的落后状态
    本报杭州12日电　以改革春耕工具为中心的农业技术革新运动已在浙江各地蓬勃展开。各地的工具改革工作，不仅比往年动手早，而且注意配套成龙。到2月23日止，全省已修理了各种春耕农具八百六十四万件，新制一千四百二十万件。在耕作方面，普遍推广了双轮双铧犁、华东水田犁、改良深耕犁和碎土耙等。黄岩、平湖、长兴、海宁四个县已经做到全部使用新式深耕犁犁田。在播种、插秧方面，各地大力推广“浙江一号”插秧机，以及棉花营养钵压制器、络麻播种器。在排灌方面，正在积极推广抽水机，其他如畜牧生产工具和食堂炊具等，也正在全面进行革新。
    各地对技术革新运动都加强了领导。例如中共宁波地委为了全面成套地革新工具，前些时候集中了全区各地水稻、棉花、畜牧、炊事、特产等五大类成套先进工具六十九种、二百多件，由地委负责同志和地委新式工具鉴定小组一起进行了鉴定。会后各地就积极推广。现在全专区已推广各种改良深耕犁三万三千六百八十一部；已有五千多个养猪场实现了饲料加工简易机械化、半机械化和用水自流化、运料车船化，煮料用万灵灶。还有三千多个公共食堂实现了切菜不用刀，用水不用挑，煮饭使用万灵灶，减少了大批后勤劳力，支援了备耕生产。
    目前全省各地的农业技术革新运动正在不断地向前推进。为了保证新式工具全部使用起来，各地还采取了一系列的组织措施。金华专区推广桐庐县双铧犁和华东水田犁“定点建站，集中使用”的办法，全专区已有一百一十三个公社建立了三百零九个双铧犁站。宁波专区各个畜牧场都按照使用新式工具的需要，按工序成立饲料生产、运输、喂养和基建等专业队（组），合理分工，实行流水作业。
    新华社拉萨11日电　西藏地区广大翻身农民热情地展开农具改革活动，决心消除封建农奴制度残留下来的用木犁木锄耕作的落后状态。
    目前，西藏农村民主改革取得了很大胜利，各地正掀起了春耕生产高潮，广大农民为了争取今年大丰收，普遍要求精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，早日从落后的农具束缚下解脱出来。他们说：不能靠“人背筐”、“二牛抬杠”和“木犁木锄”来实现农业大增产。
    西藏各级党组织根据广大农民提高生产的迫切要求，从今年年初开始就领导群众开展轰轰烈烈的农具改革运动，仅两个多月时间，全区已制造出几十种、几万件改良农具和新式农具，其中有修水利的打夯机、水闸门、钢钎、铁锄、铁锨、铁镐、大车、手推车、驮筐、铁犁、铁铧、木质齿耙、木条磨耙和水磨，并把二牛抬杠逐步改成了一牛绳索套犁牵引，还有锄、耙、镰刀，打场用的场滚，扬簸粮食用的风车，和榨油用的土榨等等。这些在西藏新出现的工具，已经在春耕生产中起到了极其良好的作用。农民们使用这些新农具时兴高采烈地说：农奴主过去把我们当成“会说话的工具”，只是鞭打、奴役我们，用乌拉差役和苛税抢夺去我们的全部劳动果实，却从来没有关心过生产；现在在共产党的领导下，我们翻了身，当家作了主人，还领导我们改革工具、大搞生产；今年的大丰收更有保障了。
    在农具改革运动中，西藏广大农民坚决听党的话，紧紧依靠群众的力量，采取了就地取材、就地改制的原则；同时，边研究、边学习、边制造、边试验、边推广，解决了材料和技术问题。林芝、墨竹工卡、乃东、江达等县，把铁木工集中起来，组成许多个农具改革小组，党的书记亲自挂帅，制造成功一件就推广一件；或者把各乡各村改革好的农具集中起来，开现场观摩会，办技术训练班，发动群众一齐动手做，使农具改革运动不断向前发展。
