Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 3rd: Encouraged by the deeds of the Soviet advanced textile worker Gaganova, a movement to help the backward catch up with the advanced is unfolding in various sectors of the Mongolian national economy.

Lubsandanzan is the director of the binding workshop of the Mongolian National Printing Factory. The workshop he leads is one of the advanced units in the printing factory. However, one of the bookbinding teams in this workshop often fails to complete its plan, which affects the successful completion of the entire workshop's plan.

A month ago, Lubsandanzan voluntarily left his job with a monthly income of 650 tugriks to go to this backward bookbinding team as an ordinary worker with a monthly income of only 300 tugriks. His communist-style action was warmly supported by the factory's party and government leaders and comrades. After arriving at the team, Lubsandanzan formed a production team of twelve people and promised to strive to become a "Socialist Labor Team." Although his technical level was relatively high, he initially found it very difficult to work because he was in an unfamiliar job. However, he worked hard to overcome all difficulties, led by example, and diligently studied. Finally, he completed 130% to 230% of his daily production quota, and motivated the workers in the entire team. Now, even the workers who had consistently failed to complete their plans in the past can complete 100% to 130% of their daily production quota. In this way, the production efficiency of the entire binding workshop has increased several times compared to before.

The captain of Mongolia's first "Socialist Labor Team," Mandahu, the chief engineer of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Locomotive Repair Factory, recently also expressed his willingness to learn from Gaganova's example and voluntarily go down to work in the factory's backward electrical workshop. The task he put forward is: to enable the electrical workshop to catch up with the advanced, become a socialist labor workshop, and complete the production plan by more than 135% every month. He also drew up a concrete plan to train one engineer and one technician each, and to help the workers in this workshop improve their technical level.

### 先进帮助后进　后进赶上先进  蒙古各经济部门许多先进职工自愿下放到后进单位

    先进帮助后进　后进赶上先进
    蒙古各经济部门许多先进职工自愿下放到后进单位
    新华社乌兰巴托3日电　在苏联先进纺织女工加干诺娃事迹的鼓舞下，一个帮助落后赶上先进的运动正在蒙古国民经济各部门中展开。
    鲁布桑丹赞是蒙古国家印刷厂装订车间的主任。他领导的车间是这个印刷厂的先进单位之一。但是这个车间的一个装帧组却常常完不成计划，因此多少影响到全车间计划的胜利完成。
    一个月以前，鲁布桑丹赞自愿离开每月收入六百五十图格里克的工作岗位，而到这个落后的装帧组去，当每月只能收入三百图格里克的普通工人。他的这个具有共产主义风格的行动受到了工厂党政领导和同志们的热情支持。到了这个组以后，鲁布桑丹赞组成了十二人的生产队，并保证要争取成为“社会主义劳动队”。他的技术水平虽然较高，但由于到了一个不熟悉的工作岗位，所以最初工作起来还是非常吃力的。但是，他努力克服一切困难，以身作则，刻苦钻研，终于以130％到230％完成每天的生产定额，并且带动了全队的工人。现在，连过去一贯完不成计划的工人也能以100％到130％完成每天的生产定额了。这样，整个装订车间的生产效率比以前提高了好几倍。
    蒙古第一个“社会主义劳动队”队长、乌兰巴托铁路机车修理厂总工程师满达胡，最近也表示要学习加干诺娃的榜样，自愿下放到这个工厂落后的电工车间工作。他提出的任务是：要使电工车间赶上先进，成为社会主义劳动车间，并每月完成生产计划135％以上。他还订出了要培养工程师和技师各一名，以及帮助这个车间的工人提高技术水平的具体计划。
