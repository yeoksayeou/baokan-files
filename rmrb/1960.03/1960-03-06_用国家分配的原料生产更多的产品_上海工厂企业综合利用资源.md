Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 5th: Shanghai factories and enterprises are widely carrying out mass resource utilization work, building indigenous and foreign equipment on a large scale, and striving to produce more products on the basis of the raw materials allocated by the state this year, so as to achieve a better leap forward this year.

This work is being carried out under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Many factories in Shanghai already had experience in comprehensive utilization of resources. In November last year, the Municipal Party Committee further organized thirteen professional collaboration groups to strengthen leadership over this work and planned to conduct research in thirteen aspects including coal, petroleum gas, natural gas, wood, sewage sludge, industrial waste liquid and gas, agricultural and sideline products, animal organs and scraps, wild plants, aquatic products, seawater, slag, and factory waste heat. Recently, various districts and grassroots production units have also established or are preparing to establish district resource comprehensive utilization research institutes (offices) and collaboration groups.

Shanghai is a comprehensive industrial city with many industries, high technical level, and convenient collaboration, providing very favorable conditions for large-scale resource utilization. In the past two years of the Great Leap Forward, considerable achievements and experience have been gained in this regard. Last year, the total amount of sulfuric acid recovered from industrial waste liquid by the chemical industry alone was equivalent to about one-sixth of the city's annual sulfuric acid production. Datong Oil Factory used indigenous methods to make white wine from rice bran cakes that had been squeezed for oil, then extracted alcohol from the white wine, and finally used the remaining distiller's grains after alcohol extraction as pig feed. The wealth created by such comprehensive utilization in one year last year was enough to build more than two Datong Oil Factories. Large-scale resource utilization has not only increased the production of a wide variety and large quantities of general industrial raw materials and products, but also provided many new raw materials for the development of advanced, precision products and cutting-edge science and technology, and improved the level of production technology. Taking Shanghai Refinery as an example, from 1954 to 1958, this factory only produced seventeen common petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and asphalt, allowing a large amount of petroleum gas to fly into the air or be burned as fuel; in 1959, the entire factory engaged in large-scale comprehensive utilization, putting forward the resounding slogan of "eating everything, squeezing everything, deep plowing, and meticulous work," and the new products trial-produced and put into production surged to seventy-five types. In the first forty days of this year, another ninety-two types were trial-produced, providing many industrial sectors with urgently needed advanced fuel oil, lubricating oil, and valuable chemical raw materials required by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in a timely manner. Pharmaceutical factories have used the organs and scraps from the processing of livestock, poultry, and aquatic products to make hundreds of advanced medicines that previously relied on imports. Biochemical pharmaceutical industry has become one of Shanghai's emerging industries with great development prospects. Many industrial waste residues, waste liquids, and waste gases have also further improved labor protection conditions and urban environmental sanitation after treatment and utilization.

Currently, a prominent feature of Shanghai's large-scale resource utilization work is the wide participation of the masses. Fully utilizing resources and increasing the production of more material wealth is increasingly becoming the conscious action of the broad masses. After the Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory's employees put forward the slogan of "using five parts of raw materials to create ten parts of products" at the beginning of the year, the value of production in January increased by 2.1 times, while the amount of raw materials only increased by 1.15 times compared with the same period last year. According to last year's experience, the employees of Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Purchasing and Supply Station have further adopted the "one-dragon" approach of supply, production, sales, and use, with everyone participating, tracking, and assisting factories in recovering scraps and waste materials, which is deeply welcomed by factories. Many fruit stores, vegetable markets, and neighborhood committees also actively help factories collect usable fruit peels and cores, organs and scraps, and even the urine of pregnant women, which can be used to make injections.

Organizing relevant scientific research units, universities, and factories for comprehensive collaboration and joint research is another feature of Shanghai's current resource utilization work. In the past year, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute helped twenty-four factories comprehensively utilize animal organs and scraps, and trial-produced and produced more than forty products, many of which were advanced drugs and important chemical raw materials that could not be produced domestically in the past. The research institute wrote twenty-one special research reports on this basis. Extracting coal tar from low-temperature coal carbonization is a very complex technology. In the past, when power plants studied it independently, progress was slow. Recently, the Municipal Chemical Bureau, the Municipal Power Bureau, the Shanghai Chemical Research Institute, the East China Institute of Chemical Technology, and other units have organized a group of technicians to assist factories in research, accelerating the progress.

The third feature of Shanghai's resource utilization work is to solve the equipment problems of comprehensive utilization by making do with whatever is available, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and doing everything possible to seize the time and utilize them as early as possible. The slogan of the employees is: if possible, use foreign methods; if not possible, "start with indigenous methods first, and then mechanize." Almost all of the comprehensive utilization equipment in many factories is designed and manufactured by the employees themselves, costing very little and producing results quickly.

### 用国家分配的原料生产更多的产品  上海工厂企业综合利用资源

    用国家分配的原料生产更多的产品
    上海工厂企业综合利用资源
    本报上海5日电　上海市工厂企业正在广泛开展群众性资源综合利用工作，大造土洋设备，力争在今年国家分配的原材料基础上，生产更多的产品，实现今年更好的跃进。
    这项工作是在中共上海市委直接领导下开展起来的。上海许多工厂原来就有着综合利用资源的经验。去年11月，市委进一步组织了十三个专业协作组，加强对这个工作的领导，有计划地从煤炭、石油气、天然气、木材、污水污泥、工业废液废气、农副产品、畜类脏器及下脚、野生植物、水产品、海水、矿渣以及工厂余热等十三个方面开展研究。最近，各区及基层生产单位也相继成立或正在筹备成立区的资源综合利用研究所（室）和协作小组。
    上海是一个综合性的工业城市，行业多，技术水平较高，协作方便，大搞资源综合利用有非常优越的条件。在过去大跃进的两年间，这方面已经取得不少成绩和经验。去年，单是化工部门从工业废液中回收的硫酸总量，就相当于全市硫酸年产量的六分之一左右。大统油厂用土办法把榨过油的米糠饼制成白酒，再从白酒中提炼酒精，最后将提炼酒精后剩下的酒糟做养猪饲料。去年一年这样综合利用创造的财富足可兴建两个以上的大统油厂。大搞资源综合利用，不仅增产了种类繁多、数量庞大的一般工业原料和产品，还为发展高级、精密产品和尖端科学技术提供了许多新的原料，提高了生产技术水平。以上海炼油厂为例，这个厂从1954年到1958年五年间，只生产常用的汽油、柴油、煤油、沥青等十七种普通石油产品，大量石油气体任其在空中飞走，或是当作燃料烧掉；1959年全厂上下大搞综合利用，提出“吃光、榨尽、深耕、细作”的响亮口号，试制和投入生产的新产品猛增到七十五种，今年头四十多天又试制了九十二种，及时提供了许多工业部门急需的高级燃料油、润滑油和化学、医药工业所需的贵重化工原料。制药工厂利用畜类、禽蛋和水产品加工后的脏器下脚，制成了成百种的向来依靠进口的高级药品。生物化学制药工业已成为上海极有发展前途的新兴行业之一。许多工业废渣、废液、废气经过处理和利用，还进一步改善了劳动保护条件和城市环境卫生。
    当前，上海大搞资源综合利用工作中一个鲜明的特点，是发动群众的面广。充分利用资源、增产更多的物质财富，日益成为广大群众的自觉行动。上海生物化学制药厂职工年初提出“用五分原料造十分产品”的口号后，1月份原料比去年同期只增加一点一五倍，产值却提高了二点一倍。上海化工原料采购供应站职工根据去年的经验，又进一步采取供、产、销、用“一条龙”的办法，人人动手，跟踪追迹，协助工厂回收下脚废料，深受到工厂欢迎。很多水果店、小菜场、居民委员会也都主动帮助工厂收集可以利用的果皮果核、脏器下脚甚至可以用来制造针剂药品的孕妇小便。
    组织有关科学研究单位、高等学校和工厂全面协作，共同研究，是上海当前开展资源综合利用工作的另一个特点。上海医药工业研究所去年一年内帮助二十四家工厂综合利用畜类脏器及下脚废料，试制和生产了四十多种产品，其中很多是过去国内不能生产的高级药物和重要化工原料。这个研究所由此写出了二十一篇专题研究报告。进行煤的低温干馏提取煤焦油是一项非常复杂的技术，过去发电厂单独研究时，进展很慢。最近市化工局、市电业局、上海化工研究院、华东化工学院等单位，组织了一批技术人员，协助工厂研究，加快了进度。
    上海开展综合利用物资工作的第三个特点，是在解决综合利用的设备问题上，因陋就简，土洋结合，尽一切可能争取时间，及早利用。职工们的口号是：能洋就洋，不能洋就“土法先上马，然后机械化”。很多工厂综合利用的设备，几乎全是职工们自己设计，自己制造，花钱很少，见效很快。
