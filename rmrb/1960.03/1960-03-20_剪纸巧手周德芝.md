    Paper-cutting Expert Zhou Dezhi
    Grandma Zhou Dezhi is a famous paper-cutting expert in Baicheng District. This year, she is already in her fifties. When she was little, she learned paper-cutting from her mother. At that time, her family was poor, and they didn't even have paper for the windows, and the broken walls kept falling soil. After she finished cutting, there was nowhere to paste them, so her skills were buried for half her life. After the land reform, everyone's life got better, and everyone wanted to decorate their houses. Since then, Grandma Zhou Dezhi's paper-cutting skills have had the opportunity to develop. She cut many animals, flowers, birds, and figures and pasted them on the walls and windows, beautifying the houses of her neighbors. Soon, she became famous in Baicheng District for her paper-cutting. Later, under the cultivation and education of the Party, she learned that paper-cutting is not only for people to appreciate, but also can be used for propaganda. She successively created more than 200 paper-cuts with modern themes, such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Cooperativization," "Great Leap Forward in Steel Production," "Great Leap Forward in Deep Plowing," "People's Commune is Good," and "General Line," in coordination with the movements. Her paper-cut "People's Commune is Good" embodies the local flavor of folk art and a unique folk art style. Last year, it was rated as a tribute work to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    剪纸巧手周德芝
    周德芝老大娘是白城区有名的剪纸巧手。今年，她已是五十多岁的人了。她在小的时候，就跟妈妈学会了剪纸。那时，家里日子穷，窗户上连张纸都没有，破墙直掉土，剪完了都没处贴，她这手艺就一直埋没了半辈子。土改后，家家光景都好了，谁都想把屋里打扮打扮。从此周德芝老大娘剪纸手艺才有了发展的机会。她剪了好些动物、花鸟和人物贴在墙上窗上，美化左邻右舍的住宅房屋。很快，她就以剪纸在白城区出了名。后来，在党的培养教育下，使她知道了剪纸不仅是让人们欣赏，而且也可以利用它进行宣传。她先后配合运动剪了“毛主席万岁”、“合作化”、“大搞钢铁”、“大搞深翻”、“人民公社好”、“总路线”等二百多件表现现代题材的剪纸。她剪的“人民公社好”那幅剪纸，体现了民间艺术的乡土气息和独特的民间艺术风格。在去年被评为向建国十周年的献礼作品。　　　　　（张国庆）
