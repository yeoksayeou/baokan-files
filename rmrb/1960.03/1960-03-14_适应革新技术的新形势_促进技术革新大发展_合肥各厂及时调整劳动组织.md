Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Telegram, Reporter Yu Feng reports: Hefei factories and enterprises, in response to the rapid growth of labor productivity after vigorously engaging in technological innovation, have promptly rectified labor organizations and improved production management, further adapting production relations to the development of productive forces, and promoting the continuous upsurge of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

Up to now, the employees of Hefei factories have put forward more than 60,000 innovation proposals, of which nearly 20,000 have been realized. In the machinery, light industry, and chemical systems, 631 manual operation procedures have been changed to mechanized or semi-mechanized, increasing efficiency by one to one hundred times or more. There are already 24 mechanized assembly lines in the city, 61 old equipment has been transformed, more than 100 are being improved, and more than 200 new special equipment have been added. Due to the adoption of highly efficient new technologies and equipment, the work that originally required many people can now be done by fewer people. In response to this situation, the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly mobilized factories to vigorously rectify labor organizations and improve enterprise management while vigorously engaging in innovation. When the Anhui No. 1 Textile Factory's West Spinning Workshop vigorously engaged in technological innovation last year, it failed to rectify the labor organization in a timely manner. The improved technical operating capabilities of many workers were not consolidated, and the output did not increase significantly. After rectifying the labor organization in January of this year, the fine yarn spinners generally eliminated the number of 400 spindles per person, increasing to 600 to 800 spindles, and some reached 1,200 spindles. In January, this workshop transferred 97 people to support other departments, and the output increased by 10% compared with December last year.

While rectifying labor organizations, many factories have formulated new quota-setting schemes. According to the new quota-setting scheme that has been implemented by the Anhui Provincial Committee Steel Plant, the number of people needed to refine one ton of iron is 2.9 times less than in the same period last year, and 0.7 times less than at the end of last year.

The 15,000 labor forces saved from technological innovation in Hefei's factories and enterprises have played a new role in other production posts.

This newspaper, Guiyang, 13th report: The Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory has made reasonable adjustments to its labor organization, adapting to and promoting the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The factory has already established and will soon establish four professional production lines for standardized products and a number of professional assembly production groups.

In the past two years of the Great Leap Forward, the production of Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory has advanced by leaps and bounds. However, with the exception of a few newly built workshops, the metalworking was all mixed operations. This operation method has shortcomings such as a wide variety of products, low utilization rate of machine tools, cross-repetition of processing procedures and types of work, large consumption of working hours, and long production cycles.

In January of this year, the factory's employees proposed 2,738 technological innovation proposals, of which 1,696 were realized, breaking through more than 100 key production points and increasing work efficiency by one to more than 3,000 times. The realization of these innovation projects made the contradictions between the shortcomings of the original production organization and the rapidly developing production even more acute. Mixed operations have a large variety of products, fast replacement of processing parts. After the efficiency of one process is improved, other processes cannot keep up in time, and the overall production level cannot be rapidly improved. The Party Committee of this factory decided to organize professional production lines for standardized products. The entire factory immediately took action and, within seven days, reasonably organized labor and equipment according to the sequence of parts processing and the size of parts of the forging machine products, and established the first professional production line in early February. The casting and forging workshops also organized professional production teams related to forging machine production, strengthening the unified arrangement of production plans.

The forging machine production line showed many advantages not long after its establishment: with the saving of machine tools and labor, the monthly output and labor productivity of forging machines increased more than doubled compared with last year. At the same time, due to mass production and centralized batches, good conditions have been created for production automation.

    适应革新技术的新形势　促进技术革新大发展
    合肥各厂及时调整劳动组织
    贵阳矿山机器厂建立定型产品专业生产流水线
    据新华社合肥电　记者于风报道：合肥市各工厂企业针对大闹技术革新以后，劳动生产率迅速增长的情况，及时整顿劳动组织、改进生产管理，使生产关系进一步适应生产力的发展，促进技术革新和技术革命运动不断高涨。
    合肥市各工厂职工到目前为止，已提出革新建议六万多条，实现了近二万条。机械、轻工、化工系统有六百三十一项手工操作工序改为机械化、半机械化，工效提高一倍至一百倍以上。全市已有机械化流水作业线二十四条，改造旧设备六十一台，正在改进有一百多台，新增专用设备二百多台。由于采用了高效率的新工艺和新设备，原来要很多人才能完成的工作，现在只要较少的人就行了。针对这种情况，中共合肥市委及时发动各工厂在大闹革新的同时，大力整顿劳动组织，改进企业管理。安徽第一纺织厂西纺车间去年大闹技术革新时，没有及时整顿劳动组织，许多工人已提高的技术操作能力未能巩固下来，产量没有显著增加；今年1月整顿劳动组织以后，细纱档车工普遍消灭了每人看四百锭的数字，提高到六百至八百锭，有的达到一千二百锭。这个车间在1月份抽出了九十七人支援其他部门，产量反而比去年12月份提高10％。
    许多厂在整顿劳动组织的同时，制定了新的定员定额方案。中共安徽省委钢铁厂已实现的新定员方案，根据现有生产水平计算，炼一吨铁所需要的人比去年同期减少二点九倍，比去年年底减少零点七倍。
    合肥市各工厂企业从技术革新中，节省出的一万五千个劳动力，又在其他生产岗位上发挥了新的作用。
    本报贵阳13日电　贵阳矿山机器厂对劳动组织进行合理调整，适应和促进了技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。全厂已经和即将建立四条定型产品的专业生产流水线和若干专业流水生产组。
    贵阳矿山机器厂在过去两年的大跃进中，生产突飞猛进。但是这个厂除少数新建车间外，金工全部是混合作业。这种作业法有生产品种杂乱、机床利用率低、加工工序和工种交叉重复、工时消耗大、生产周期长等缺点。
    今年1月，这个厂的职工就提出技术革新建议二千七百三十八件，实现了一千六百九十六件，突破生产关键一百多个，提高工效一倍至三千多倍。这些革新项目的实现，使原有生产组织的缺点同迅速发展生产的矛盾显得更加尖锐。混合作业的产品品种多，加工部件更换快，一个工序工效提高以后，别的工序不能及时跟上，整个生产水平仍不能迅速提高。这个厂的党委决定组织定型产品的专业生产流水线。全厂立即行动起来，七天内按照锻钎机产品零件加工的先后、机件的大小等合理组织劳动力和设备，在2月初建立了第一条专业生产流水线。铸造和锻造车间也组织了有关锻钎机生产的专业生产班，加强了对生产计划的统一安排。
    锻钎机生产流水线建立不久便显出了很多优点：在节约机床和劳动力的情况下，锻钎机月产量和劳动生产率比去年增加一倍以上。同时，由于成批生产，批量集中，便为生产自动化创造了良好条件。
