A Good Son of the Uyghur People

Editor's Note: Comrade Yüsün Aysan has been selected as a labor model of the county and autonomous region five times in recent years. In May 1959, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee regarded him as a pacesetter for production team leaders and called on all commune cadres in Xinjiang to learn from him. Last May, the Yingjisha County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed cadres throughout the county to launch a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Yüsün Aysan. All 3,881 cadres above the level of production team leader in the county participated in this learning movement, which focused on improving work style and raising leadership levels. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, 85 Yüsün Aysan-style cadres have been selected by commune members and cadres throughout the county. Currently, the movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Yüsün Aysan is still developing continuously.

Yüsün Aysan, a pacesetting Uyghur production team leader in Xinjiang and an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China in Yingjisha County, gloriously participated in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China last year. He met Chairman Mao in Huairen Hall in Beijing and shook hands with him. So much happiness and excitement welled up in his heart. He thought: I have done too little for the Party. He wished he could immediately fly to the fields under the Pamir Plateau.

After Returning from Beijing

From Beijing to Xinjiang, Yüsün Aysan was constantly planning how to achieve a great leap forward in 1960. He returned to Yingjisha County on December 12. At the county, he heard that most of the commune members in their production brigade were building the Tiewezi Grand Canal. Although he had been away from home for more than three months, he did not go home first, but went straight to the water conservancy construction site that night. The canal project at the construction site was to be built in the steep valley of the old riverbed. A gentle-sloped, dry-laid cobblestone canal required a large amount of excavation, with the soil being hoisted by ropes to the top of a steep cliff more than 40 meters high. This was too slow! Yüsün Aysan pondered as he worked. At night, he found several experienced commune members and proposed the idea of using water to flush the soil. Everyone agreed with this method, believing that the flushed soil could also be used as backfill in a low-lying area. The next day, they opened a temporary canal next to the Grand Canal to release water to flush the soil. However, the soil was falling too fast, and some of it was settling at the bottom of the canal. Yüsün Aysan still felt it was not fast enough, so he took off his padded jacket and leather boots, picked up a soil-cutting hoe, and jumped into the bone-chilling rapid current. He swung the soil-cutting hoe to dislodge the soil, and as soon as the soil entered the water, it immediately turned into a turbid mud that rushed down. When the commune members saw Yüsün Aysan jump in, dozens of people followed suit one after another, forming a relay of people in the rapid current, with people on top dumping the soil and people below dislodging it. In this way, the efficiency of the project increased tenfold.

After staying at the water conservancy construction site for ten days, he felt that there would be no problem with water this year, so he rushed back to the team to focus on preparing for spring planting. He returned to the team at night, and the next day, before dawn, he went to the fields and livestock pens of each team. He saw that the amount of accumulated fertilizer was still less than 6,000 jin per mu on average, and he thought, how can we achieve a great harvest with this little fertilizer! That day, he found six pairs of baskets and held a meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader at night, arranging the spring planting preparation work centered on accumulating fertilizer and giving each brigade cadre a pair of baskets. The next day, before dawn, Yüsün Aysan went out carrying baskets. When the brigade cadres came to the team in the morning to learn, they saw a pair of baskets filled with manure placed at the entrance. They smiled at each other and said: We have fallen behind again. From then on, all the cadres in the team who went to the fields and inspected the work carried a pair of baskets, picking up manure as they walked and publicizing to the masses wherever they went.

Leading Production Through Labor

Every morning before dawn, Yüsün Aysan would go out carrying baskets. By the time he had breakfast, he had not only filled a load of manure, but also learned about the production situation of each small team yesterday. After eating, he would put a soil-cutting hoe, hoe, or sickle in the baskets and go wherever the commune members were working. He would take out his own tools and work with them. Wherever he went, the efficiency and quality would change. After the work was completed, he would take out his own work point book and let everyone rate him, without deducting points for an hour. Yüsün Aysan, who had worked as a beast of burden for landlords for ten years in the old society, has never left labor since he led mutual aid groups and agricultural cooperatives, and now serves as the deputy secretary of the Party General Branch of the Second Management District of the Wuqia People's Commune, and the captain of the Yawaq Production Brigade and the secretary of the Party Branch. He arranges all the brigade's meetings at night. After making a decision at the meeting to implement the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, he goes to the production team to work with the commune members, inspecting the work and solving problems during labor. In 1958, he worked 300 labor days. Last May, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee regarded him as a model production team leader for all of Xinjiang and called on all cadres of the people's communes in Xinjiang to learn from him. Last August, the brigade decided to expand the winter wheat area from more than 800 mu in the previous year to 1,600 mu. According to this plan, the team decided to plant winter wheat on 800 mu of fallow wasteland on the edge of the village and reclaim another 200 mu of virgin land there. Yüsün Aysan led more than 100 commune members to set up camp on the wasteland and fully discussed with everyone the significance and methods of completing this task. He himself worked diligently with the commune members from morning to night, deeply inspiring everyone. As a result, the speed of land reclamation and leveling was unexpectedly fast. He also worked with the masses to solve the problem of high alkalinity in the wasteland. Now, this field of winter wheat is growing like any other field, already showing a patch of green. The commune members all said that this was due to the efforts of their brigade leader.

Changing Old Habits and Asking the Land for Grain

Walking into the wheat fields and fallow land of Yawaq, a moist atmosphere immediately rushed towards you. The winter-irrigated wheat and fallow land no longer need to be watered for greening, and the fallow land can be sown as soon as the soil temperature rises. The worries of people competing for water to sow during the spring dry season for many years have been completely eliminated. However, winter irrigation has only been around for two years here. In the past, although there was a lot of winter fallow water, people did not have the habit of winter irrigation. In the spring of 1958, they encountered a water shortage, and the farmers of Yawaq had to use gourds to carry water from other places to plant seeds. Yüsün Aysan learned a lesson from this. That winter, he persuaded the commune members to break the old habits and carry out winter irrigation. He personally went to the fields, day and night, to lead the commune members to irrigate wheat fields and fallow land. Not many days after the start of winter irrigation, the dam broke one night. As soon as he heard about it, he ran. At this time, the breach in the dam was more than ten feet wide, and the yellow water was rushing towards the Gobi Desert. The canal was already dry. He ran back to the village and called cadres and shouted for commune members from house to house. Everyone got up and left. Everyone saw that the breach was getting wider and wider, and said that they would wait until next spring to repair it. Yüsün Aysan said nothing, took off his padded jacket and leather boots, and jumped into the rapid current of the breach with a soil-cutting hoe. When the Party and League members on the dam saw Yüsün Aysan go into the water, they jumped in one after another. The more than 300 people on the dam suddenly had confidence and quickly threw branches, stones, and broke frozen soil. Everyone fought hard for more than four hours and finally blocked the breach. That winter, more than 4,000 mu of wheat fields and fallow land in the entire brigade were irrigated once with winter water. Although they encountered a water shortage again in the spring, the wheat was sufficiently moist, and corn and cotton were sown in time. From that year on, winter irrigation became a habit.

In April of the year before last, Yüsün Aysan heard that applying human manure and urine to crops could increase grain production, so he decided to try it first for everyone to see. On the day of the experiment, he took off his boots, rolled up his trouser legs, mixed water into the thin fertilizer pit at the edge of the field, stirred it evenly, and then used a pottery pot to scoop it out and pour it along the wheat roots. Some people with superstitious ideas said: Urine splashed on the body will contaminate a person's soul. Because of this superstition, there are no toilets in every household here, let alone the use of manure and urine to fertilize the fields. After Yüsün Aysan watered a wheat field, he washed his hands and feet in the canal, smiled, and said: Let them see again in a few days. A few days later, the third-class seedling field that had been topdressed with quick-acting fertilizer suddenly turned from yellow to green and grew a lot. At this time, thousands of years of habits began to shake. Ai Zi Mu Halili, an old farmer in his sixties, was the first to take the urine accumulated in pottery pots and pour it into the thin fertilizer pool. When Yüsün Aysan saw that everyone's thinking was clear, he mobilized the masses to build toilets and urine pools and establish thin fertilizer pits in the fields.

He is a Good Cadre of Chairman Mao

In recent years, Yawaq has changed from a place that was short of grain every year to a place that is self-sufficient and has a surplus. Last year, each person had nearly 2,000 jin of grain. In addition to selling it to the state and retaining enough rations, there were more than 100,000 jin of grain stored. Yüsün Aysan has been rated as a labor model and pacesetter of the county and autonomous region for six consecutive years. However, he did not become complacent because of this. He himself has no office, no desk, and no bed. The accountant bought him a desk, but he resolutely returned it, saying, "I can work anywhere." Once, the brigade accountant Ma Mutise Yiding and the cashier each bought a bookkeeping pen worth one yuan and five jiao and went to Yüsün Aysan to approve the reimbursement slip. Yüsün Aysan said: The commune members use their own soil-cutting hoes for labor, and we cadres are also spending the commune's money for a pen for work. Do you think it is reasonable? The accountant was asked with a flushed face, and from then on, every time he spent a penny, he would repeatedly consider whether it was reasonable and necessary.

When the masses have difficulties in life, Yüsün Aysan is never stingy. Commune member Aiheman Semanti was sick and had financial difficulties. When Yüsün Aysan returned to the team, he held a special meeting for this matter, withdrawing 20 yuan from the public welfare fund to treat the commune member and buying clothes for him. Mutton was given to commune members who were ill. At the meeting, Yüsün Aysan educated the team's cadres, saying: Not only should we lead production well, but we should also care about the lives of commune members. Since then, the brigade cadres have made it a system in their work to visit commune members and understand the difficulties of the masses. The commune members of Yawaq praised Yüsün Aysan as a cadre who is connected to their hearts. When the masses have difficulties, they can get warmth and help from him. Before the people's commune in the autumn of 1958, Ai Bi Dula, who was over seventy years old, fell ill. He had no children. Yüsün Aysan took him to his own home to take care of him. However, due to his old age and frailty, his illness became more and more serious, and he died half a month later. After the old man died, Yüsün Aysan took money from the public welfare fund and personally took care of the funeral according to Uyghur customs. On the day of the burial, he acted as the old man's son, wearing filial piety and carrying the coffin to the funeral. When the coffin passed through the village, the people in the whole village felt the happiness of the new society when they saw this scene. Mu Sha Yi Mamu, an old man in his sixties, could not restrain his inner excitement and said to the people with tears in his eyes: "He is a good cadre of Chairman Mao and a good son of our Uyghur people."

    维吾尔族的好儿子
    编者按：玉素音艾山同志几年来，五次被评选为县和自治区的劳动模范。1959年5月，新疆维吾尔自治区区党委把他作为生产队长的标兵，号召全新疆公社干部向他学习。中共英吉沙县委去年5月指示全县干部开展学、追、超玉素音艾山的运动。全县生产三千八百八十一名生产队长以上的干部，都投入了这个以改进工作作风提高领导水平为中心的学习运动。从去年年底到今年年初，全县经社员、干部评选出来的玉素音艾山式的干部已有八十五名。现在，全县学、赶、超玉素音艾山运动还在持续发展。
    新疆维吾尔族标兵生产队长、英吉沙县优秀共产党员玉素音艾山，去年光荣地参加了建国十周年大庆。在北京怀仁堂见到了毛主席，并和毛主席握了手。多少幸福和激动涌上心头，他想：我为党作的事情太少了。他恨不得立即插翅飞到帕米尔高原下的田野去。
    从北京回来以后
    从北京到新疆，玉素音艾山一直盘算着1960年怎样大跃进。12月12日他回到英吉沙县。在县上听说他们生产大队多数社员正在修建铁委孜大渠，虽然他离家三个多月了，却没有先回家，连夜径往水利工地。工地上的渠道工程要在陡峭的山谷老河床修建。一条缓坡干砌卵石渠道，大量挖方土用绳索吊运到四十多米高的陡崖上边。这样太慢啊！玉素音艾山一边劳动，一边盘算着。夜里，他找了几个有经验的社员，提出用水冲土的想法，大家同意这条办法，认为冲下去还可作一段洼地垫方土。第二天就在大渠旁边开了一条临时渠放水冲土。但土倒的快了，有一部分土沉在渠底。玉素音艾山还嫌不快，他脱去夹袢、皮靴，拿上砍土镘跳进刺骨的急流里，挥动砍土镘拨土，土一进水立即变成混浊的泥水疾驰而下。社员看到玉素音艾山跳进去，几十个人接二连三地下了水，在急流里排成一条接力的人流，上面倒，下面拨，这样，工程效率一下就提高了十倍。
    在水利工地呆了十天，他感到今年水不成问题了，又匆匆回到队上抓备耕。夜里回到队上，第二天天没亮就到各队的田地和畜圈去。他一看积肥数量每亩平均还不到六千斤，心想这点肥料怎么能取得大丰收！当天他找了六对筐担，夜里召开生产小队长以上的干部会议，布置了以积肥为中心的备耕工作，给了大队干部每人一对筐担。第二天天没明，玉素音艾山就挑上筐担出去了。早晨大队干部来队里学习时，一看门口放着一对装满了粪的筐担，他们互相笑着说：又落后了。从此上地和检查工作的全队干部，一人一对筐担，边走边拾粪，走到哪里，就向群众宣传。
    在劳动中领导生产
    每天早晨天不亮，玉素音艾山就挑上筐担出门，到吃早饭时，不但拾满一担粪，各小队昨天生产的情况也了解了。吃饭后，在筐担里放上砍土镘、锄头或镰刀，走到哪里，社员干什么，他就拿出自己的工具一起干。他到哪里，那里的功效、质量就变了样。劳动完了，他掏出自己的工分本，让大家给评分，一个钟头之内还不要分。在旧社会给地主作过十年牛马的玉素音艾山，从领导互助组、农业社，直到现在担任乌恰人民公社二管理区党总支副书记，牙瓦克生产大队长兼党支部书记以来，这些年从没有离开过劳动。他把大队的会议都安排在夜里，会上作出贯彻上级任务的决定之后，便到生产队同社员一起劳动，在劳动中检查工作，解决问题。1958年他干了劳动日三百个，新疆维吾尔自治区党委在去年5月把他作为全新疆生产队长的榜样，号召全新疆人民公社干部向他学习。去年8月，大队决定冬麦面积从前年八百多亩扩大到一千六百亩。根据这个计划，队上确定把村边八百亩轮歇荒地种冬麦，并在那里再开生荒二百亩。玉素音艾山领了一百多个社员，在荒地安营扎寨，同大家充分讨论了完成这项任务的意义和办法。自己每天从早到晚，同社员一起扎扎实实的劳动，深深鼓舞了大家，结果开荒、平地的速度出乎意料的快。至于荒地碱大的问题，他也同群众研究解决了。现在，这片冬麦长得同一类田一样，已泛起一片绿色。社员们看了都说这是咱们大队长的功劳。
    改变旧习惯向地要粮
    走进牙瓦克的麦田和白地，脚下立即扑来一股湿润的气息。经过冬灌的小麦和白地，小麦不需要再浇返青水，白地只待地温上升就可播种。多少年来人们在春季枯水期争水播种的忧虑完全消除了。但冬灌在这里才只有两年历史。过去冬季虽有大量冬闲水，人们却没有冬灌习惯。1958年春天遇到缺水，牙瓦克农民不得不用胡芦到外地背水点种，玉素音艾山记取了这一教训。这一年冬天，他说服社员打破老习惯进行冬灌。他亲自到田间，日夜领导社员浇灌麦田和白地。冬灌开始不几天，一天夜里拦水坝决口了。他一听拔腿就跑。这时，水坝决口一丈多宽，黄水滚滚冲向戈壁滩，水渠已经干了。他跑回村里挨户挨家叫干部，喊社员。大家都爬起来就走。大家一看决口越来越宽，说要等明年春天再修。玉素音艾山二话没说，脱去夹袢和皮靴，拿了一把砍土镘就跳进决口的急流里。坝上的党、团员一看玉素音艾山下了水，也接二连三地跳进去。坝上三百多人顿时有了信心，连忙丢树枝、石头，破冻土，大家奋战了四个多小时，终于堵住决口。这年冬天，全大队四千多亩麦地和白地，都灌了一次冬水，春天虽然又遇上缺水，但小麦墒足，玉米、棉花及时播种。从那一年起，冬灌才成了习惯。
    前年4月，玉素音艾山听到庄稼追施人粪和尿能增产粮食，决定先试试让大家看。试验这天，他脱掉靴子，卷起裤腿，在地头的稀肥坑里掺上水，搅匀，然后用陶罐舀出来沿着麦根浇过去。有迷信思想的人说：尿溅在身上会沾污人的灵魂。由于这种迷信思想，这里家家无厕所，更不利用粪尿肥田。玉素音艾山浇完一块麦田，在水渠洗了手脚笑了笑说：过几天再让他们看。几天之后追施速效肥的三类苗田，突然由黄变绿，猛长了一截。这时千年习惯开始动摇了。六十多岁的老农艾孜木哈里，最先把积在陶罐里的尿拿来倒进稀肥池。玉素音艾山看到大家思想通了，便动员群众大修厕所、尿池，在田头建立稀肥坑。
    他是毛主席的好干部
    这几年，牙瓦克从年年缺粮变为自给有余，到去年每人有粮近两千斤，除出售国家和留足口粮外，还存粮十多万斤。玉素音艾山连续六年被评为县、自治区的劳动模范和标兵。但是，他并没有因此而居功自满。他自己没有办公室、没有桌子、没有床，会计给他买了一张桌子，他坚决让退掉，说“我在哪里都可以办公”。有一次大队会计麻木提色一丁和出纳一人买了一支价值一元五角的记账水笔，拿去找玉素音艾山批报销条子。玉素音艾山说：社员劳动用的砍土镘都是自己的，我们干部工作用的一支笔也让社里花钱，你们说合理吗？会计被问得满面通红，以后每支出一文钱，总要反复考虑是否合理、必要。
    当群众生活上有困难的时候，玉素音艾山却从不吝啬。社员艾合曼色满提有病，经济上又有困难。玉素音艾山回到队上，为这事专门开了会，从公益金中支了二十元为这个社员治病，还买了衣服送给他。对患病的社员都送了羊肉。在会上，玉素音艾山教育队上干部说：不光领导好生产，还要关心社员生活。此后，大队干部把访问社员、了解群众困难作为工作上的一项制度。牙瓦克的社员称颂玉素音艾山和他们是心连心的干部。群众有了困难，都能从他身上得到温暖和援助。1958年秋天人民公社化以前，七十多岁的艾比都拉病了，他无儿无女，玉素音艾山便把他接到自己家里侍养。但由于年老体衰，病势日益沉重，半月后就病故了。玉素音艾山在老人死后，从公益金中拿出钱，按照维吾尔人的礼俗亲自料理丧事。在埋葬的那天，他作为老人的儿子带孝扶柩送葬。灵柩路过村中时，全村人们看到这种情景，深深感受到了新社会的幸福。六十多岁的老人木沙衣麻木，抑制不了内心的激动，热泪满眶地向人们说：“他是毛主席的好干部，我们维吾尔人的好儿子。”
