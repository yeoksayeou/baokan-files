Secretary Goes to the Kitchen

The First Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Leting County, Hebei Province, took the lead in going to the kitchen. Party organization secretaries of all thirty-five communes, two hundred and twenty-eight large brigades, and more than one thousand four hundred villages in the county also went to the canteen to run "experimental plots." Many of them served as canteen administrators or cooks, helping the canteen improve management and improve meals. This is a concrete manifestation of the Party's concern for the lives of the masses.

The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about their lives; the more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater their enthusiasm will be. This shows that leading production and leading life are an inseparable unified whole. To do a good job in production, we must do a good job in life. At present, the spring plowing production campaign has been launched vigorously, and people are full of energy and high spirits. Isn't this precisely the result of our Party's comprehensive efforts in grasping production and grasping life?

The important significance of the secretary going to the kitchen also lies in further consolidating and improving the management level of the canteen. After the secretaries at all levels in Leting County went to the kitchen, they immediately established a canteen management committee with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone and formulated management systems. Most canteens raised pigs, grew vegetables, and established non-staple food production bases. There has also been great success in the reform of cooking utensils. This is the power of the secretary taking command.

The practice of Party committee secretaries at all levels going to the kitchen is worth promoting!

    书记下伙房
    中共河北乐亭县委第一书记带头下伙房，全县三十五个公社、二百二十八个大队和一千四百多个村的党组织书记，也都先后到食堂搞“试验田”，其中有许多人担任了食堂的管理员或炊事员，帮助食堂改进了管理工作，办好了伙食。这是党关心群众生活的具体表现。
    群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众的生活；党越是关心群众的生活，群众的干劲也就会越大。这说明领导生产和领导生活是一个不可分割的统一整体。要搞好生产，就必须搞好生活。目前，春耕生产运动已经轰轰烈烈地展开起来，人们干劲冲天，意气风发，这难道不正是由于我们党全面抓生产和抓生活的结果吗？
    书记下伙房的重要意义，还在于进一步巩固和提高了食堂的管理水平。乐亭县各级书记下伙房以后，立即建立了以贫农、下中农为骨干的食堂管理委员会，制定了管理制度；多数食堂养了猪、种了菜，建立了副食品生产基地；炊具改革也有很大的成绩。这是书记挂帅的威力。
    各级党委书记下伙房的做法值得提倡！
