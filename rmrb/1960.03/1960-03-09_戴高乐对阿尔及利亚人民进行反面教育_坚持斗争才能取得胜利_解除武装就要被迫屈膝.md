The "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" Radio Station Points Out: The territory, the people's unity, and the national sovereignty of Algeria are indivisible, and the Algerian people will never compromise on these three basic principles. De Gaulle's aggressive clamor only strengthens the Algerian people's determination to fight.

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th, Cairo Dispatch: The "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio station commented on the evening of March 6th on De Gaulle's recent clamor against Algerian independence and for the continuation of the war of aggression, stating that De Gaulle's speech only strengthened the Algerian people's determination to fight.

The radio station emphasized that De Gaulle "makes us understand what we did not understand: that peace must first be achieved by force. The people will only be free to express their will after force (struggle)."

The radio station said, "Just as the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria announced that peace could be obtained immediately in Algeria, the French head of state emphasized that the Algerian problem could only be resolved after a long time. When our government claimed that we could achieve independence by peaceful means, De Gaulle replied that the Algerian problem could only be resolved by the military victory of the French army."

The radio station pointed out, "De Gaulle has undeniably taken a step backwards. He deprives the right of self-determination of all content. He tells us directly his intentions for Algeria: Disarmed (Algerian) people, whether they like it or not, will be forced to accept his arguments." The radio station said that De Gaulle "wants to use force to silence our people and force our people to submit."

The radio station said, "In any case, we have three basic principles, and we will never compromise on these: 1. The territorial integrity of Algeria; 2. The unity of the Algerian people; 3. The indivisibility of Algerian national sovereignty."

The radio station concluded that the Algerian people are determined to achieve victory. "We will never be discouraged and will fight for our principles and rights."

    戴高乐对阿尔及利亚人民进行反面教育
    坚持斗争才能取得胜利  解除武装就要被迫屈膝
    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台指出：阿尔及利亚的领土、人民团结和国家主权不可分裂，阿尔及利亚人民在这三个基本原则上绝不妥协。戴高乐的侵略叫嚣只是加强了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争决心。
    新华社7日讯　开罗消息：“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台6日晚上在评论戴高乐最近表示反对阿尔及利亚独立、继续进行侵略战争的叫嚣时指出，戴高乐的讲话只是加强了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争决心。
    电台强调指出，戴高乐“使我们懂得我们所不懂的东西：必须首先用武力来取得和平。人民只有在武力（斗争）之后才会自由表达自己的意志。”
    电台说，“正当阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣布可以立即在阿尔及利亚获得和平的时候，法国国家元首却强调阿尔及利亚问题只能在长时间以后得到解决。当我国政府声称我们可以以和平的方法取得独立时，戴高乐却回答说阿尔及利亚问题只能以法军的军事胜利来解决。”
    电台指出，“戴高乐无可争辩地向后倒退了一步。他使自决权失去一切内容。他直截了当地把他对阿尔及利亚的意图告诉我们：解除武装的（阿尔及利亚）人民不论愿意与否，都将被迫接受他的论点。”电台说，戴高乐“要用武力来迫使我国人民沉默，要我国人民屈膝。”
    电台说，“不管怎么样，我们有三个基本原则，我们在这方面绝不妥协：一、阿尔及利亚的领土完整；二、阿尔及利亚人民的团结；三、阿尔及利亚国家主权的不可分裂。”
    电台最后说，阿尔及利亚人民决心取得胜利。“我们将永不气馁地为我们的原则和权利而斗争。”
