Setting High Standards

    The Shijiazhuang Steel Plant's proposal to the nation's steel enterprises to complete the first quarter's steel production plan ahead of schedule has been realized, which was expected. The Shijiazhuang Steel Plant has many valuable experiences in completing the first quarter's production plan, and one of them deserves special attention. That is, they compared their own achievements with the outstanding achievements of steel enterprises nationwide, and conscientiously learned from their advanced experiences, thereby setting a high standard for themselves, and constantly demanding themselves according to this standard.
    In our great era, the cause of socialist construction is advancing at a rapid pace, just like the surging river. A great leap forward everywhere, a great leap forward in everything, and a great leap forward for everyone, just like a hundred boats racing forward. In the surging torrent of the great leap forward where everyone is catching up with each other, no one wants to fall behind others. High standards are the upstream; whoever achieves high standards will win the upstream. If everyone can, with a spirit of continuous revolution, unceasingly muster their energy and demand themselves with high standards, it will undoubtedly promote the high-speed advancement of our era and bring about a leap forward in all our undertakings.

    树立高标准
    石钢向全国钢铁企业提出提前完成首季钢铁生产计划的倡议实现了，这是意料中的事情。石钢在完成首季生产计划中有很多宝贵的经验，其中有一条值得引起特别重视，这就是他们把全国钢铁企业的出色成绩拿来跟自己比较，并且认真学习人家的先进经验，从而在自己面前树立一个高标准，时时刻刻以这个标准来要求自己。
    在我们这个伟大的时代里，社会主义建设事业正以一日千里的速度向前发展，恰似江水滔滔。处处跃进，事事跃进，人人跃进，又恰似百舟竞发。在你追我赶的跃进洪流中，谁也不愿意落在别人的后面。高标准，就是上游；谁实现了高标准，谁就会争得了上游。如果大家都能以不断革命的精神，不停顿地鼓足干劲，以高标准要求自己，那就无疑地会推动我们这个时代高速度地前进，使我们的各项事业都来个飞跃的发展。
