Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 10th. The Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, led by Bogusław Płasa, representative of the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art, and Mira Zimińska-Sygietyńska, the troupe leader, left Guangzhou by special train today after a seven-day visit and performance in Guangzhou.

The rich, colorful, and dazzling artistic flowers from various parts of Poland brought by the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble deeply attracted the Guangzhou audience. The Polish artists also sang Chinese songs such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Ode to the Motherland," and "The Half Moon Climbs Up" in Chinese.

After performing two shows at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the song and dance ensemble went to Xinhua People's Commune in Huaxian County to perform for the commune members, workers, students, cadres, and stationed troops in nearby communes, receiving a warm welcome from the audience.

On the eve of their departure from Guangzhou, Li Jiarren, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, hosted a banquet on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee to bid them farewell.
