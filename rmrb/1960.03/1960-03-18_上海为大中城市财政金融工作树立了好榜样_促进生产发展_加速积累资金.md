Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 17th: Shanghai's financial departments, closely centering on the Party's central work, combining internal and external efforts, and vigorously engaging in mass movements, have strongly supported and promoted the high-speed development of production. At the same time, they have opened up a lively, vigorous, and Great Leap Forward situation for financial work. In 1959, Shanghai's total fiscal revenue increased by 44% compared with 1958, and fiscal expenditure increased by 29.3%. In 1959, fiscal and enterprise deposits increased by 46.1% and 29.2% respectively compared with 1958; bank loans increased by 58.8%. In the first two months of this year, the city's fiscal revenue increased by 72% compared with the same period in 1959. This excellently realized the principle of "more income, more expenditure, more construction, more income, more expenditure, more construction," becoming a red banner for fiscal and financial work in large and medium-sized cities nationwide.

Through the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Shanghai's fiscal and financial cadres further improved their political views, production views, and mass viewpoints. At the beginning of 1959, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the call to continuously improve labor productivity and achieve continued Great Leap Forward. A new upsurge of mass movements was quickly launched on the industrial front, and mass movements in the fiscal and financial systems also saw new development. Over the past year, the movement has expanded from internal to external, gradually closely combining with the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy in factories and enterprises. It has developed more rapidly, more widely, and more deeply, adapting to and promoting the continuous leap forward of the national economy. The road for fiscal and financial work to promote production has thus become wider and wider.

Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments, together with production departments, combining internal and external efforts, and vigorously engaging in mass movements, have mainly adopted three approaches to promote the high-speed development of production.

First, participate in production, immerse yourselves in the masses, strengthen economic activity analysis, and serve as "advisors" for factories and enterprises. Shanghai's fiscal and banking cadres have fully leveraged the characteristics of fiscal and financial work as comprehensive departments with broad contact, understanding of the situation, and mastery of materials. They have gone deep into factories and enterprises, identified the gap between advanced and backward from various economic indicators, analyzed the reasons, and provided reference for the leadership of factories and enterprises. This has played a significant role in helping enterprises grasp the key to production, tap potential, and achieve an all-round leap forward. After the Municipal Party Committee put forward the call to improve labor productivity, with one person doing the work of one and a half, the cadres of the fiscal and financial departments actively carried out work around this central task. The fiscal cadres of Luwan District found that the labor productivity of the originally advanced Qinyu Underwear Weaving Factory was lagging behind that of the Shanghai Underwear Factory. With the support of the directors of the two factories, they, together with the factory finance personnel, analyzed and compared the forty-seven processes of the two factories one by one, and found that the production of six processes in the Qinyu Factory was greatly behind. They also helped find the reasons for the backwardness. The Qinyu Factory promptly mobilized the masses to make suggestions, set measures, attack key issues, and overcome these weak links, and production rose rapidly. In January of this year, the average output of绒衫(rong shan, woolen sweater) per worker per shift was 2.01 dozen, which increased to 2.51 dozen in mid-February, and labor productivity increased by 20.7%. After the Municipal Party Committee issued the call for high yield, high quality, and strict economy, the fiscal and banking cadres actively participated in the stocktaking movement of factories and enterprises, and vigorously promoted the conservation of raw materials. Through guidance and inspection, they learned about the inventory of materials in enterprises and reported to the district party committees where they were located. Under the unified leadership of the district party committees, they organized the adjustment of materials between enterprises. Through the stocktaking movement, they helped dispose of stagnant materials worth more than 300 million yuan, greatly promoting the development of production.

Second, in the Great Leap Forward, the high-speed development of factory and enterprise production, the continuous breakthrough of old quotas, and the continuous emergence of new production achievements urgently required the organization of cooperation in raw materials, equipment, technology, and labor, and the full use of production potential. The fiscal and financial departments actively participated in and organized communist-style large-scale cooperation.

The form of cooperation organized by Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments developed from small to large and from low-level to high-level. Initially, based on their characteristics of broad activity, they carried out individual "linking," "bridging," and "needle threading" between enterprises to organize cooperation. With the continuous leap forward of production, many problems needed to be solved within a larger scope of cooperation. Therefore, the form of cooperation developed from individual enterprises to "three-line cooperation" between finance, banks, and production units under the unified leadership of the district party committees, and further developed to comprehensive large-scale cooperation involving finance, finance, production, transportation, science and technology departments, and all factories. In the fourth quarter of last year, the staff of the Yangpu District Office of the People's Bank of China, in order to support factories in completing their plans ahead of schedule, put forward the slogan "Fight for production, attack key issues, seize every second, and fight a big battle in the fourth quarter to ensure a full house in the district." Under the leadership of the Yangpu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they actively participated in and organized the district's communist-style large-scale cooperation. They promptly went deep into production to understand the situation, reported to the district party committee, carried out propaganda and mobilization among enterprises, and played a role in connecting, organizing, supervising, and inspecting among the various cooperation groups and units. Thirty factories in the district originally had difficulty completing their plans. Through large-scale cooperation, they achieved a "full house," and the district's industrial production completed the annual state plan sixteen days ahead of schedule.

Third, vigorously help factories and enterprises implement team and group accounting, and promote the vigorous development of mass-based economic accounting movements. In the continued Great Leap Forward last year, the competition climax on Shanghai's industrial front continued to develop in depth. Workers urgently demanded to know their contribution to the country and their labor situation, in order to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses in the production process, and improve production levels more quickly. At the same time, factories, enterprises, and fiscal and financial departments also needed to understand the specific situation of the production leap forward in a timely and in-depth manner, in order to further organize and promote production. In this new situation, it was obviously no longer sufficient to rely solely on the professional personnel of the enterprise finance department to carry out accounting to understand and analyze the production situation. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments mobilized all cadres to focus on August and September, promote and help enterprises carry out team and group accounting, and quickly form a mass-based economic accounting movement. By the end of last year, 95% of the city's independent factories and central factories had implemented team and group accounting to varying degrees, with a total of more than 48,000 worker accountants.

Mass-based team and group accounting has greatly enriched the content of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and has great political and economic significance. After the workers mastered accounting tools, their sense of responsibility and awareness as masters of their own affairs greatly increased. At the same time, through team and group accounting, workers could not only understand their production situation at any time, but also see the achievements of advanced producers, which further motivated their labor enthusiasm and directly promoted the further development of the competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. The connecting rod group of the forging workshop of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory originally had an output of 180 pieces in both Class A and Class B. During the competition, the output of Class A increased to 200 pieces. Class B used the data from team and group accounting to grasp key issues and improve operating tools, and the output increased to 250 pieces. Class A also made great efforts in technical innovation, improved design, and simplified processes, and the output quickly increased to 300 pieces. At present, the output of both classes has exceeded 500 pieces. On the other hand, because team and group accounting deeply and promptly reflected the gap between advanced and backward in production, it also helped enterprise leaders to discover weak links and key issues in production in a timely manner, and to grasp production organization work deeply, meticulously, and thoroughly, so as to overcome key issues link by link and achieve continuous leap forward.

Through the above methods, Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments, combining internal and external efforts, and vigorously engaging in mass movements, promoted the high-speed development of production. The Great Leap Forward in production can continuously expand the sources of funds and achieve the high-speed accumulation of funds. And the leap forward of fiscal and financial work has strongly supported and promoted the leap forward of production. This is the result of Shanghai actively implementing Chairman Mao's economic policy thoughts of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" and "the quality of fiscal policy is certainly sufficient to affect the economy, but what determines finance is the economy" under the situation of the Great Leap Forward. Shanghai's experience shows that fiscal and financial work must be based on the development of production, and the road can become wider and wider, and the mass movement can continue to develop vigorously.

    上海为大中城市财政金融工作树立了好榜样
    促进生产发展　加速积累资金
    主要作法是：深入企业加强经济活动分析，参与和组织大协作，帮助企业推行班组核算
    据新华社上海17日电　上海市财政金融部门紧密围绕党的中心工作，内外结合，大搞群众运动，有力地支持和促进生产的高速度发展，同时也给财政金融工作开辟了一个生动活泼、朝气蓬勃的大跃进局面。1959年上海全年的财政收入比1958年增长44％，财政支出增长29．3％；1959年财政和企业的存款，分别比1958年上升46．1％和29．2％；银行放款上升了58．8％；今年头两个月，全市财政收入又比1959年同期增长了72％。出色地实现了“多收入、多支出、多建设、更多地收入、更多地支出、更多地建设”这一方针，成为全国大中城市财政金融工作的一面红旗。
    上海市财政金融干部，通过1958年的大跃进，政治观点、生产观点和群众观点都有了进一步提高。1959年初，中共上海市委提出不断提高劳动生产率，实现继续大跃进的号召，工业战线上迅速掀起了群众运动的新高潮，财政、金融系统的群众运动也有了新的发展。一年来，运动从内部扩大到外部，逐渐同工厂企业的增产节约群众运动密切结合起来，开展得更迅速、更广泛、更深入，适应和促进了国民经济的不断跃进。财政金融工作促进生产的道路因此越走越宽。
    上海财政金融部门同生产部门一起，内外结合，大搞群众运动，促进生产高速度发展的做法主要有三个方面。
    第一，参与生产、深入群众，加强经济活动分析，当好工厂、企业“参谋”。上海的财政、银行干部，充分发挥了财政金融工作接触面广、了解情况和掌握材料多这一综合部门的特点，深入工厂、企业，从各种经济指标中，找出先进落后的差距，分析原因，提供工厂企业的领导方面参考，这对企业抓住生产关键，挖掘潜力，实现全面跃进起了很大的作用。去年市委提出了提高劳动生产率，一个人抵一个半人的号召后，财政金融部门的干部就积极围绕这一中心任务开展工作。卢湾区财政干部发现原来先进的勤余内衣织造厂的劳动生产率落后于上海内衣厂。在两个厂的厂长支持下，他们同工厂财务人员一起，对两厂的四十七道工序一一进行分析对比，发现勤余厂有六道工序的生产大大落后，并且帮助找出了落后的原因。勤余厂及时发动群众提建议，定措施，攻关键，克服了这些薄弱环节，生产迅速上升。今年1月份，平均每个工人每班生产绒衫二点零一打，2月中旬就增加到二点五一打，劳动生产率提高20．7％。当市委发出高产、优质、厉行节约的号召后，财政银行干部又积极参与工厂、企业的清仓运动，大搞原材料的节约。他们通过辅导检查，了解企业的库存物资情况，向所在的区委汇报。在区委统一领导下，组织企业之间的物资调剂。通过清仓运动，帮助处理了价值三亿多元的呆滞物资，大大促进了生产的发展。
    第二，在大跃进中，工厂企业生产高速度发展，旧的定额不断被突破，生产上的新成就连续涌现，不断出现了新的不平衡，迫切需要在原材料、设备、技术和劳动力等方面组织协作，充分发挥生产潜力，财政金融部门积极参与和组织共产主义大协作。
    上海财政金融部门组织协作的形式是由小到大、由低级到高级发展的。起初根据他们活动面广的特点，在企业之间进行个别的“挂钩”、“搭桥”、“穿针引线”，组织协作。随着生产的不断跃进，有许多问题需要在更大的协作范围内求得解决。因此协作的形式便从个别企业之间发展到在区委统一领导下财政、银行和生产单位的“三线协作”，又进一步发展到财政、金融和生产、交通、科技等部门以及全部工厂参加的全面大协作。去年第四季度，上海人民银行杨浦区办事处的职工，为了支持工厂提前完成计划，提出“为生产、攻关键、分秒必争、大战第四季度，确保全区满堂红”的口号，在中共杨浦区委领导下，积极参加、组织全区的共产主义大协作。他们及时地深入生产了解情况，向区委汇报，在企业之间进行宣传鼓动，并且在各协作小组和单位之间起联系、组织、督促、检查的作用。这个区原有三十个工厂完成计划有困难，通过大协作，实现了“满堂红”，全区工业生产提前十六天完成全年国家计划。
    第三，大力帮助工厂企业推行班组核算，促进群众性的经济核算运动蓬勃开展。在去年继续大跃进中，上海工业战线上的竞赛高潮不断深入发展。工人们迫切要求知道自己对国家的贡献和劳动情况，以便在生产过程中，取长补短，更快地提高生产水平。同时工厂、企业和财政金融部门也需要及时深入地了解生产跃进的具体情况，以便进一步组织和促进生产。在这新形势下，仅仅依靠企业财务部门的专业人员进行核算来了解和分析生产情况，显然已不能适应。上海财政金融部门根据市委指示，动员全体干部，大抓8、9两月，推动和帮助企业大搞班组核算，迅速形成一个群众性的经济核算运动。到去年年底，全市已有95％的独立厂和中心厂在不同程度上实行了班组核算，共有工人核算员四万八千多人。
    群众性的班组核算，大大丰富了“两参一改三结合”的内容，具有很大的政治和经济意义。工人们掌握核算工具后，当家作主的责任感和自觉性大大提高。同时通过班组核算，工人们不仅能够随时了解自己的生产情况，也能够看到先进生产者们的成绩，劳动热情更高，直接推动了比、学、赶、帮竞赛的进一步开展。上海柴油机厂锻工车间连杆小组，原来甲、乙班产量都是一百八十只，竞赛中甲班产量提高到二百只，乙班运用班组核算的资料，抓住关键，改进操作工具，产量上升到二百五十只；甲班也大闹技术革新，改进设计，简化工序，产量又迅速提高到三百只。目前这两个班的产量都已超过五百只。另方面，由于班组核算深入及时地反映了生产上先进与落后的差距，也帮助企业领导上及时发现生产上的薄弱环节和生产关键，把生产组织工作抓深、抓细、抓透，从而一环扣一环地攻克关键，实现不断跃进。
    上海财政金融部门通过以上办法，内外结合，大搞群众运动，促进了生产的高速度发展。生产大跃进，才能不断扩大资金来源，实现资金的高速度积累。而财政金融工作的跃进，又有力地支持和促进了生产的跃进。这是上海在大跃进的形势下，积极贯彻毛主席关于“发展经济、保障供给”和“财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济”这一经济政策思想的结果。上海的经验表明，财政金融工作必须以发展生产为前提，路子才能越走越宽，群众运动就可以不断地蓬勃开展。
