　　North wind blows, snowflakes flutter,
　　Vast snow covers the mountainside.
　　Beneath the snow mountain, beside the birch forest,
　　The Oroqen hunting team rushes along the mountain path.
　　The old captain waves the red flag,
　　Standing on the mountaintop, blowing the deer whistle.
　　Blowing, blowing, the tune changes,
　　Who knows what the captain is thinking?
　　Doo, doo, the tone is agitated,
　　The young people's hearts leap when they hear it.
　　The E family has blown the deer whistle for three generations,
　　Each generation is better than the last.
　　In the old society, the suffering was unbearable,
　　The Japanese devils wanted to uproot the E family.
　　The Xing'an Mountains have many treasures,
　t allowed the E family to search the mountains.
　　Even with venison, fox fur, and sable…
　t enough to keep them warm or feed them.
　　A bowl of meat, a bowl of wine,
　　Hate swallowed in their bellies, tears streaming down.
　　That winter, the snow fell heavily,
　　One night, Erbao was born.
　　Carried on their backs, hung from trees,
　　The Japanese devils couldn't find out.
　　How quickly the days pass,
　　In the blink of an eye, Erbao has grown up.
　　Holding his father's hand, he smiles:
　　Let me go hunting, okay?…
　　The old man raises his beard high,
　　Takes the deer whistle from his shoulder.
　　Take it! This family heirloom,
　　One day you will blow the deer whistle well.
　　The old man's deer whistle blows beautifully,
　　Making the young people laugh heartily.
　　Someone turns around and calls Erbao,
　　You must continue to blow the deer whistle.
　　Erbao blushes and feels shy,
　　You're just making fun of me.
　　The old man sees how proud the young people are,
　t blowing a sad tune, but a new tune.
　　The water sings, the mountains laugh,
　　The whistle echoes in the Xing'an Mountains.
　　The family heirloom is passed on,
　　One new deer whistle for each person.
　　The whistle is the command signal,
　　Roe deer and wild deer all report.
　　The Xing'an Mountains have a good hunting ground,
　　How good the commune's hunting ground is.
　　Out of the forest, running in the mountains,
　　All kinds of game are the commune's treasures.
　　Blowing, blowing, the tune changes again,
　　The Oroqen people's lives are good.
　　Demolishing "yaluo" (note), moving into new houses,
　　Wearing leather hats, wearing leather coats.
　　Venison is delicious, roe deer is fragrant,
　　A bowl of sweet wine makes people laugh.
　　The E family has blown the deer whistle for three generations,
　　Now the deer whistle's tune is wonderful.
　　The Oroqen people are good marksmen,
　　The game falls at the sound of the gun.
　　Good! Good! There is so much game,
　t help but make the old man laugh in his heart.
　　The red flag flutters in the Xing'an Mountains,
　　Let's blow another tune praising the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.
　　Note: Yaluo - Oroqen tents

   吹鹿哨　唱新调
   袁袖
   北风吹，雪花飘，
   茫茫大雪没山腰。
   雪山下，桦林旁，
   鄂伦春猎队奔山道。
   老队长把红旗摇，
   站在山头吹鹿哨。
   吹着，吹着换了调，
   队长的心思谁知道？
   嘟，嘟，音调躁，
   青年人听着心里跳。
   鄂家三代吹鹿哨，
   一代更比一代好。
   旧社会，苦难熬，
   鬼子要把鄂家种根拔掉。
   兴安岭上多样宝，
   不许鄂家满山找。
   纵有鹿肉狐皮貂……
   仍然穿不暖来吃不饱。
   一碗肉，一碗酒，
   仇恨肚里咽，热泪滔滔。
   那年冬天大雪飘，
   一天夜晚生二宝。
   身上背，树上吊，
   鬼子知道可不得了。
   日子过得真快呵，
   转眼二宝长大了。
   拉着他爹的手，抿嘴笑：
   让我打猎好不好？……
   老汉把胡子翘的高，
   从肩上摘下鹿哨。
   拿去吧！这只传家宝，
   总有一天你会好好吹鹿哨。
   老汉的鹿哨吹的俏，
   吹得青年人捧腹笑。
   有人回头叫二宝，
   你要接着吹鹿哨。
   二宝脸红害了臊，
   你们竟拿我开玩笑。
   老汉看着青年人多骄傲，
   不吹悲调吹新调。
   水也唱呵山也笑，
   哨音在兴安岭上呼啸。
   传家宝传开了，
   一人一只新鹿哨。
   哨音就是命令号，
   獐狍野鹿都报到。
   兴安岭上好猎场，
   公社的猎场有多好。
   林里出，山里跑，
   各样猎物是社里宝。
   吹着，吹着又换了调，
   鄂伦春人的生活好。
   拆压罗（注），换新房，
   戴皮帽，穿皮袄。
   鹿肉美，狍肉香，
   甜酒一碗人欢笑。
   鄂家三代吹鹿哨，
   如今鹿哨调子妙。
   鄂伦春人枪法好，
   枪响猎物应声倒。
   好呵！好呵！猎物真不少，
   止不住老汉我心里笑。
   兴安岭上红旗飘，
   再吹一曲党和毛主席的好领导。
   注：压罗　鄂伦春的帐篷
