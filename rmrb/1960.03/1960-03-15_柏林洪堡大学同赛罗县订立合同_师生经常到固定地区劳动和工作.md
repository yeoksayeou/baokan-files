    Humboldt University of Berlin Signs Contract with Seelow County
    Faculty and Students Regularly Labor and Work in Fixed Areas
    For a year and a half, in the villages of Seelow County in the Oderbruch district on the Oder River in the German Democratic Republic, one could often find many college students and teachers enthusiastically laboring alongside the farmers.
    It turns out they are faculty and students from Humboldt University of Berlin. In order to help accelerate agricultural development and improve the scientific and cultural level of farmers, and to combine their theoretical knowledge with practice, Humboldt University signed a cooperation contract with the state organs, agricultural production cooperatives, and machine tractor stations of Seelow County a year and a half ago. The contract stipulates that university faculty and students should impart their rich scientific knowledge to farmers to promote large-scale agricultural production and increase yields. In return, cooperative farmers would introduce their practical experience, thereby providing new and valuable insights for the university's teaching and research work.
    Today, students from Berlin often go with their teachers to stay in the villages of Oderbruch for several days or weeks. They study the economic, cultural, and political problems of rural residents, draw scientific conclusions, and promote them. For example, Professor Heide and Professor Trenner are conducting soil research with their students. Veterinary Professor Scheetz examines the health and breeding possibilities of livestock in the Wohlin Agricultural Production Cooperative. Professor von der Aa gives reports on livestock hygiene to farmers in the Seelow cooperative—and learns from their experience and observations in discussions.
    Education students also went to the countryside for ten weeks with their lecturer, Dr. Klörss, to labor in the Dürgling Agricultural Production Cooperative. They want to become rural teachers and teach "biology." They have received thorough scientific training and are proficient in educational issues. Now they are studying the flora and fauna of this area in Dürgling. Not only that, but education students also help in the fields and livestock sheds, because there is no place like working together to speak so freely with the parents of their future students.
    Students in the Department of Agricultural Economics put forward crop rotation plans in order to further master their future profession. Young philosophers help build livestock sheds, and also pay attention to how to promote internal democracy in the young agricultural cooperative. Female students from the law department are studying the new rules of cooperative life, and are working tirelessly at rural congresses to persuade the last few female farmers to exercise all their rights as women in order to achieve the equality of women guaranteed by the constitution and laws.
    It has become commonplace for a production team leader of a certain cooperative to report to university students on sowing, field management, fertilization, and harvesting, with the university students becoming his enthusiastic and attentive students.

    柏林洪堡大学同赛罗县订立合同
    师生经常到固定地区劳动和工作
    一年半以来，在德意志民主共和国奥得河畔的奥得布罗赫区赛罗县的村庄里，人们经常可以发现许多大学生和教师们同农民们一起热情地劳动着。
    原来他们是柏林洪堡大学的师生。为了帮助加速农业发展和提高农民的科学、文化水平，并使自己的理论知识同实践结合起来，洪堡大学在一年半以前同赛罗县的国家机关、农业生产合作社及机器拖拉机站签订了挂钩合同。大学师生——合同这样规定——向农民传授他们的丰富的科学知识，以促进农业大生产和提高产量。合作社农民则介绍他们在实际工作中所取得的经验，从而向大学的教学和研究工作提供新的宝贵启示。
    今天，柏林的大学生经常同他们的老师一起到奥得布罗赫的村庄里去住上几天和几个星期。他们研究农村居民的经济、文化和政治问题，作出科学的结论并且加以推广。例如，赫伊德教授和特伦纳尔教授同他们的学生一起进行土壤研究。兽医教授谢茨检查沃林农业生产合作社牲畜的健康状况和繁殖可能性。冯德阿教授向赛罗合作社农民做关于畜舍卫生的报告——并且在讨论中学习他们的经验和观察。
    教育系的学生也和他们的讲师克勒赛博士下乡去了十个星期，在杜尔格林农业生产合作社劳动。他们想当农村教师、教“生物”课。他们受过彻底的科学训练，精通教育学的问题。现在他们在杜尔格林研究这个地区的动植物。不仅如此，教育系的学生也在农田和畜舍里帮忙干活，因为没有任何一个地方像在共同劳动中一样能和他们未来的学生的父母如此畅所欲言。
    农业经济系的学生提出了轮种计划，以便进一步掌握他们未来的职业。年青的哲学家帮助建设畜舍，同时也关心如何在年轻的农业合作社里发扬社内民主。法律系的女同学在研究合作社生活的新规律，并且在农村大会上不懈地努力说服最后的几个女农民行使她们作为妇女的一切权利，以实现宪法和法律所保证的妇女平权。
    某一合作社的生产队长向大学生做关于播种、田间管理、施肥和收割的报告，大学生成为他的热诚的专心听讲的学生，这也已成为家常便饭了。柏林洪堡大学学生帮助农民收马铃薯
