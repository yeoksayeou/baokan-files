    Beijing (by this newspaper) -- Beijing's catering service industry is comprehensively assisting neighborhood residents' dining halls in improving their business management, greatly promoting the socialization of housework and collectivization of life, and supporting production.

    With the continuous leap forward in production and the participation of a vast number of neighborhood women in production, more than two thousand residents' dining halls have recently been established in Beijing. To promote the further consolidation and development of this collective welfare undertaking, employees from five to six hundred large and medium-sized restaurants across the city have been assigned to work with nearby residents' dining halls based on district and area, providing comprehensive assistance.

    Many restaurants have adopted methods such as compiling simple teaching materials and giving regular collective lessons to the staff of residents' dining halls to impart cooking skills. Employees of the Tong Chun Yuan Restaurant compiled teaching materials on topics such as selecting and preparing ingredients, frying, stir-frying, braising, operational techniques, nutritional knowledge, coarse grain preparation, and simple common sense of cost accounting. Chefs and management personnel regularly lectured the 120 employees of nearby dining halls. They also cooked dishes on the spot. Through this method of imparting skills, the cooks of the residents' dining halls quickly understood the principles of food preparation and learned how to operate.

    Some restaurants send chefs and accountants to residents' dining halls to provide specific guidance. Hou Shiying, a chef from the Du Yi Chu Restaurant, helped the cooks of the Xuandi Temple neighborhood residents' dining hall learn how to make four or five different flavors of dishes from one cabbage. In the past, the cooks of this dining hall stir-fried rapeseed that was black in color and bitter in taste, which the masses were unwilling to eat. Hou Shiying taught them how to stir-fry rapeseed, and the stir-fried rapeseed was both delicious and beautiful. Accountants from the Xicheng District Erlong Road Catering Center store are responsible for helping sixteen nearby dining halls improve their business management. Addressing the situation where many dining halls had unclear procedures and inaccurate cost calculations, they assisted these dining halls in establishing ledgers, inventory receiving and inspection, storage and requisition systems, and simple cost accounting. They also helped the twenty-six accountants in these sixteen dining halls learn cost accounting and rationally control gross profit margins. This enabled the dining halls to have a clear understanding of their operations and achieve a balance between income and expenditure. Many restaurants also sent production and technical personnel to dining halls to introduce experience in saving grain and coal, and helped promote the use of cooking machinery. With the help of restaurants such as Tong Chun Yuan, the Chang'an Street residents' dining hall and the Fusujing residents' dining hall in Xicheng District have installed six or seven new cooking utensils such as vegetable cutting machines, dough mixing machines, and filling pressing machines, basically achieving semi-mechanization and greatly improving work efficiency.

    Some restaurants also invite people from residents' dining halls to come to the restaurants for internships and short-term training.

    With the strong assistance of the catering industry, the business management level of many neighborhood residents' dining halls in Beijing has been greatly improved, and they are deeply welcomed by residents. Many residents' dining halls have also won the titles of municipal and district red banner units. (Attached picture)

    北京大、中饭馆职工深入街道参加组织人民经济生活
    作居民食堂的好参谋
    分片挂钩　传授技术　帮助改进经营管理和服务质量
    本报讯　北京市饮食服务行业全面协助街道居民食堂改进经营管理，大大促进了家务劳动社会化、生活集体化，支持了生产。
    随着生产的继续跃进和广大街道妇女参加生产，最近北京市兴办了二千多个居民食堂。为了促进这个集体福利事业进一步巩固和发展，全市五、六百个大、中型饭馆的职工按区分片，分头同附近的居民食堂挂了钩，进行全面的帮助。
  不少饭馆采取了编写简易教材；给居民食堂的人员定期集体讲课的办法传授烹调技术。同春园饭庄的职工们编写了选料开生、煎炒烹炸、操作技术和营养知识、粗粮细作、成本核算简易常识等教材，由厨师和管理人员定期对附近食堂的一百二十名职工讲课。他们还当场作饭作菜。通过这种办法传授技术，居民食堂的炊事员们很快就懂得了饭菜制做的道理，学会了操作。
    有的饭馆派厨师和会计到居民食堂去作具体指导。都一处饭馆厨师侯世英帮助玄帝庙街道居民食堂的炊事员学会用一棵白菜做出四、五种不同味道的菜。这个食堂的炊事员过去炒油菜色黑味苦，群众不愿吃，侯世英就教给他们炒油菜的方法，炒出的油菜又好吃又美观。西城区二龙路饮食中心店的会计人员，负责帮助附近十六个食堂改善了经营管理工作。他们针对许多食堂手续不清，成本计算不精确等情况，协助这些食堂建立了账簿，和进货验收、保管领料等制度以及简易成本核算，并帮助这十六个食堂的二十六名会计学会了成本核算，合理掌握毛利率。这样使食堂做到了心中有数，收支平衡。许多饭馆还派生产技术人员到食堂介绍了节粮、节煤的经验，帮助推广使用炊事机械。西城区长安街居民食堂、福绥境居民食堂在同春园等饭馆的帮助下，已安装了切菜机、合面机、压馅机等六、七种新的炊事用具，基本上实现了半机械化，大大提高了工作效率。
    有的饭馆还把居民食堂的人请进饭馆来实习，短期培训。
    北京市许多街道居民食堂，在饮食业的大力帮助下，经营管理水平大大提高，深受居民欢迎。不少居民食堂还获得了市、区红旗单位的称号。（附图片）
