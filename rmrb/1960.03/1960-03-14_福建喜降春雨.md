Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 13th. From March 9th to the morning of March 12th, various parts of Fujian Province successively welcomed spring rain. The general rainfall was about ten to thirty millimeters, and some areas reached more than forty to sixty millimeters.

In areas with heavier rainfall, all communes have seized the favorable opportunity after the rain to store and conserve water and rush to plant spring crops. In Longxi, Jinjiang, Longyan and other regions, as well as Minhou and Xiamen, the rainfall is smaller and cannot fundamentally eliminate the threat of drought. The drought resistance army in these areas is making persistent efforts to continue to launch surprise attacks to build water conservancy projects and fight drought by dissolving soil.

    福建喜降春雨
    新华社福州13日电　从3月9日到12日上午止，福建各地先后喜降春雨，一般降雨量在十到三十毫米左右，部分地区达四十到六十毫米以上。
    降雨较大的地区，各公社都已抓紧雨后有利时机，蓄水保水，抢播春种作物。龙溪、晋江、龙岩等专区和闽侯、厦门等地雨量较小，还不能根本解除干旱威胁。这些地区的抗旱大军正再接再厉，继续突击兴修水利和抗旱溶田。
