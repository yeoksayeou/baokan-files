The People's Daily News: Zhejiang Province's rural people's communes, on the basis of implementing the "Three Guarantees" down to the team level, are striking while the iron is hot, and rapidly launching a vigorous mass movement to exceed contracted production and exceed planned targets. The broad masses of cadres and commune members are determined to work hard and achieve a great surpassing of agricultural production plans, to realize an even better, comprehensive, and sustained leap forward this year.

When carrying out the "Double Exceed" movement, various localities have conscientiously summarized the experience of two consecutive years of great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, and realized that under the leadership of the Party, relying on the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and giving full play to people's subjective initiative, production will surely continue to leap forward significantly. Various localities have also made cadres and commune members realize, through comparing outputs and digging into potential, that not only do areas with originally low production levels have great potential for exceeding contracted production and planned targets, but even areas with originally high production levels also have great potential. This is because high-yield areas have experience in significantly increasing production, and cadres and the masses are full of enthusiasm. At the same time, high-yield areas also have the phenomenon of unbalanced production. Everyone realized that whether it is plains or mountains, whether it is grain, cotton, hemp, tea, silkworm cocoons, animal husbandry, forestry, fisheries, or sideline occupations, everywhere can greatly exceed contracted production and planned targets, and everything can greatly exceed contracted production and planned targets. After Lanxi, Yiwu, and other counties proposed exceeding contracted production and planned targets, the broad masses of commune members were overjoyed and even more enthusiastic. Commune members in each county put forward nearly 200,000 rationalization proposals, further setting off a high tide of spring plowing production.

Resolutely implementing the policy of "multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvests," and striving to expand the planting area of early rice, miscellaneous grains, and other grain crops, is an important measure for exceeding contracted production and planned targets. Various localities have firmly grasped this work. The Rui'an County Party Committee inspected the Chengguan Commune and found that there were many gaps that could be used. In addition to studying the expansion plan with the commune Party committee, it also promoted the expansion of planting by more than 100,700 mu throughout the county. Jinyun County put forward the bold slogan of "All Party members and all people mobilize, hold high the red flag and march forward forever, surpass the whole year in spring and summer, and strive to win the red flag county of the province." It widely mobilized commune members to speak out and debate, breaking down erroneous ideas such as the theory that production has reached its peak and the theory of solely relying on conditions, and implementing the plan to exceed contracted production to the plot level. In the Jiaxing area, various localities formulated plans from top to bottom to "exceed contracted production, exceed planned targets, and comprehensively exceed." The area of early rice has been expanded again and again, and the area currently implemented in the fields has expanded from 3.3 million mu to 3.49 million mu. The planting area of miscellaneous grains in mountainous areas will also be greatly expanded. According to statistics from Changhua, Changxing, Anji, Haining, and Tongxiang counties, the planned use of the "six sides" (field edges, pond edges, mountain edges, road edges, grave edges, and house edges) and the reclamation of wasteland totals more than 54,600 mu.

In the movement to exceed contracted production and planned targets, cadres at all levels further developed the working style of the mass line. According to statistics from eight counties in the Wenzhou Special Zone, including Huangyan, Rui'an, and Lishui, more than 13,000 cadres have been assigned to production teams to lead spring plowing production. The entire area also transferred 1,439 cadres to specifically strengthen the leadership of the three types of production teams. Among the 4,175 small teams in Jinhua County, 4,142 small teams have small-section plans and quota management responsibility systems. Commune members reflected: "If the small team management is done well, the 'Three Guarantees' plan will surely be exceeded."

The mass movement to exceed contracted production and planned targets has greatly promoted the current spring plowing production. More than 200 million jin of early rice have been sown throughout the province, totaling 980,000 mu, and the sowing period in various localities is generally earlier than last year. 236.6 million jin of sweet potato seedlings have been cultivated, overfulfilling the plan.

The People's Daily News: Sixty-one counties (cities) in Yunnan Province are enthusiastically carrying out a super contracted production emulation drive to ensure that contracted production is implemented, and targets are advanced; actual production exceeds contracted production, measures exceed targets, enthusiasm exceeds measures, and fight for March, striving for a sustained leap forward in grain and livestock in 1960.

The super contracted production competition movement initiated by sixty-one counties is being carried out under an excellent situation. A larger leap forward upsurge swept across the province. The province's water conservancy construction has completed 71.4% of this year's planned number, and the amount of water storage has increased by 2.3 billion cubic meters compared with the same period last year; the reclamation of wasteland and the opening of fields has long exceeded the original plan; the fertilizer for the major spring crops in many areas has been fully accumulated; the quality of fertilizer is better than in any previous year; the number of live pigs is continuing to increase sharply. Various preparations for farming work have not only been grasped early, but also done excellently, and the planting season will generally be advanced. The broad masses are full of spirit and enthusiasm, and are fighting on various posts with new leap forward steps. The labor attendance rate in various parts of the province has generally reached more than 90%. The mass movement to strive for a comprehensive great leap forward is moving from one victory to another with the force of a bamboo splitting.

Fumin County, which achieved a double harvest of rice and wheat last year, and Chengjiang County, which is known for grain production, are conducting a competition. Fumin County plans to increase its total grain output this year by 50% compared with 1959, with an average of 2,000 jin of grain per person, double the number of pigs, one pig per mu of field, and increase the number of sheep by 50%, with an average of one sheep for every two people. The measures are to seize the season and rush to plant, plant half of the seedlings before the beginning of summer, and close the seedling gate before the Lesser Fullness; plant corn in large quantities during the Grain Rain, and finish planting before the beginning of summer. Increase fertilizer application, 10,000 jin per mu. Resolutely implement rational close planting, planting 35,000 to 50,000 clumps per mu of rice. Deep plowing of seven or eight inches to eliminate stuffy fields. Strengthen field management, and manage until the grain enters the barn.

Yiliang County put forward a competition proposal to Jianchuan and Yuxi counties. Yiliang County guarantees to achieve a thousand-jin county of rice this year, one pig per mu of land, and one sheep per person. Their measures are: to seize close planting with revolutionary means. The seedling field has now been expanded from the original 21,000 mu to 32,000 mu, and 70% of the seedlings have been sown. Adopt six methods of blocking, diverting, lifting, storing, closing, and managing, mainly based on sealing ditches and cutting off flows, and march towards the sky water, surface water, and groundwater to increase the amount of water and ensure that 90% of the rice fields are irrigated in the absence of rain, and that the seedlings are planted before the beginning of summer and the Lesser Fullness. Strive to apply 500 loads of fertilizer per mu, accumulate all of it by the end of March, and transport 90% to the fields. There are also deep plowing, expanding the area, etc. In terms of animal husbandry production, grasp the three links of breeding, feed, and prevention of disease epidemics. Currently, 50,000 sows and 100,000 ewes have been retained, which can ensure the realization of this year's leap forward plan. Yuxi County warmly responded to Yiliang County's proposal and decided to achieve a thousand-jin county of rice this year, a three-hundred-jin county of flue-cured tobacco, triple the number of pigs, an average of 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of tobacco, 50 jin of oil crops, and one pig per person. They say one is one, and they have set out various hard measures according to the plan, putting the leap forward plan on a reliable basis. In the 90,000 mu of tobacco fields, all of them will retain branch tobacco and regenerated tobacco. This alone can harvest an additional 100 jin of flue-cured tobacco per mu.

Sixty-one counties (cities) in the province put forward ten proposals for carrying out the competition. The main contents are: (1) Resolutely complete and overfulfill the various planned targets stipulated by the state, and ensure the completion of the planting area according to the season, quality, and variety. (2) Prevent and resist drought, broaden water sources, and ensure that more than 90% of the seedlings are planted by the Lesser Fullness when it does not rain. (3) Grasp fertilizer in a big way, ensure that the major spring crops are fully fed, and generally apply no less than 8,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and more than 10,000 jin for high-yield fields. (4) Engage in deep plowing in a big way, improve the soil, and level the land. Generally, deep plow no less than six to eight inches in ordinary fields, and deep plow one foot in high-yield fields. (5) Persist in rational close planting, and fully tap the potential of close planting to increase production. Each county must set out the specifications for rational close planting of various crops. (6) Do a good job in field management, formulate operating procedures for field management, and improve the management system to ensure that measures to increase production are implemented in the fields. (7) Resolutely carry out a large-scale high-yield and high-yield movement, establish command fields at all levels, and set an example. (8) Carry out a tool reform movement centered on semi-mechanization, requiring that about 50% of the rice fields be planted with rice transplanters; comprehensively promote the use of various new tools, saving more than 30% of labor. (9) Ensure the high-speed development of animal husbandry, double the number of live pigs, increase the number of sheep by 35%, and increase the number of large livestock by 18%. (10) Run public canteens well, arrange the lives of the masses, strictly implement planned grain use, save grain use, develop vegetable growing and pig raising, establish collective housework, and ensure that commune members eat their fill and eat well.

The counties pointed out in their competition books that the primary guarantee for realizing this year's sustained leap forward is to continue to hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, let go and mobilize the masses, give full play to the unparalleled power of the people's communes, and implement politics in command in all work. From the two years of the Great Leap Forward, everyone deeply realized that the General Line is the key link, and when the key link is straightened out, everything falls into place. Using the General Line to arm the minds of cadres and the masses, continuously boost their enthusiasm, strive for the upstream, difficulties will be overcome, and a great leap forward situation will emerge. This year's sustained leap forward task is great, and there will inevitably be many difficulties. However, everyone unanimously expressed their determination to overcome difficulties, ride the waves forward, make all preparations, and ensure the realization of the leap forward plan under any circumstances.

    云南六十一县开展对手赛保质保量全面完成种植计划
    本报讯　浙江省农村人民公社在“三包”落实到队的基础上，趁热打铁，迅速展开了轰轰烈烈的超包产、超规划的群众运动。广大干部、社员决心大干特干，争取农业生产计划大超特超，实现今年更好的、全面的持续跃进。
    各地在开展“双超”运动的时候，都认真总结了1958、1959两年连续大跃进的经验，认识到在党的领导下，依靠总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，充分发挥人们的主观能动性，生产就一定可以连续地、大幅度地跃进。各地还通过摆产量、比高低、挖潜力，使广大干部、社员认识到，不但原来生产水平较低的地区超包产、超规划潜力极大，即使原来生产水平较高的地区，也同样有很大的潜力。因为高产地区有大幅度增产的经验，干部、群众干劲足，同时，高产地区也同样存在着生产不平衡的现象。大家认识到不论平原、山区，不论粮食、棉、麻、茶、茧、畜牧、林业、渔业、副业，到处都可以大超包产、大超规划，样样都可以大超包产、大超规划。兰溪、义乌等县提出超包产、超规划之后，广大社员心花怒放，干劲更足，每个县的社员都提出了近二十万条合理化建议，进一步掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    坚决贯彻执行多种、高产、多收方针，努力扩大早稻、杂粮等粮食作物种植面积，是超包产、超规划的一条重要措施。各地都紧紧抓住了这项工作。瑞安县委检查了城关公社，发现这个社可以利用的空隙地很多，除和社党委一起研究了扩种计划外，又推动全县扩种十万零七千多亩。缙云县提出了“全党全民总动员，高举红旗永向前，春夏两季超全年，力争产量翻一番，誓夺全省红旗县”的豪迈口号，广泛发动社员鸣放辩论，破除增产到顶论、唯条件论等错误思想，将超包产计划落实到丘。嘉兴地区各地从上到下制订“超包产、超规划、全面超”的规划，早稻面积一再扩大，目前落实到田的面积又从三百三十万亩扩大到三百四十九万亩。山区杂粮种植面积也将大大扩大。据昌化、长兴、安吉、海宁、桐乡五县统计，规划利用六边（田边、塘边、山边、路边、坟边、屋边）和开垦荒地共达五万四千六百多亩。
    在超包产、超规划运动中，各级干部进一步发扬了群众路线的工作作风。温州专区据黄岩、瑞安、丽水等八个县统计，共有一万三千多干部落实到生产队，领导春耕生产。全区还抽调一千四百三十九名干部，专门加强对三类型生产队的领导。金华县四千一百七十五个小队，有四千一百四十二个小队有小段计划、定额管理责任制。社员反映：“小队管理搞得好，三包计划一定超”。
    超包产、超规划的群众运动大大推动了当前春耕生产。全省早稻已播种两亿多斤，计九十八万亩，各地播种期普遍比去年提早。番薯育苗二亿三千六百多万斤，超额完成了计划。
    本报讯　云南六十一个县（市）热烈开展超包产对手赛运动，保证做到包产落实，指标先进；实产超包产，措施超指标，干劲超措施，大战3月，争取1960年粮畜持续跃进。
    六十一个县倡议的超包产竞赛运动，是在一片大好形势下开展的。更大的跃进高潮席卷全省各地。全省水利建设已完成今年计划数的71．4％，蓄水量比去年同期增加二十三亿方；开荒开田早已超额完成了原订计划；许多地区的大春用肥已积足；肥料质量比以往任何一年都好；生猪头数正在继续猛增。各项备耕工作不仅抓得早，而且干得出色，栽插节令将普遍提前。广大群众意气风发，干劲冲天，正以新的跃进步伐，战斗在各个岗位上。全省各地的劳动出勤率，普遍达到90％以上。力争全面大跃进的群众运动，正以破竹之势，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    去年获得稻麦双丰收的富民县和以产粮著称的澄江县开展竞赛。富民县计划今年粮食总产量比1959年增产五成，平均每人有粮二千斤，猪翻两番，每亩田地一头猪，羊增五成，平均两人一只。措施是抓节令抢栽，立夏栽秧一半，小满关秧门；包谷在谷雨大量种，立夏全种完。增施肥料，每亩一万斤。坚决推行合理密植，水稻每亩栽三万五千丛到五万丛。深耕七、八寸，消灭闷头田。加强田间管理，管理管到粮进仓。
    宜良县向剑川、玉溪两县提出竞赛倡议。宜良县保证今年实现水稻千斤县，每亩地一头猪，每人一只羊。他们的措施是：以革命手段大抓密植，现在秧田已从原来二万一千亩扩大到三万二千亩，已撒下秧70％。采取以封沟断流为主的堵、引、提、蓄、关、管六个办法，向天上水、地上水、地下水三路进军，增加水量，保证在滴雨不下的情况下，保灌稻田90％，在立夏、小满内栽完秧。每亩施肥力争五百挑，3月底全部积足，90％运送下田。还有深耕、扩大面积等。在畜牧业生产方面，抓紧繁殖、饲料、预防病疫三个环节。现已留母猪五万头，母羊十万只，可以确保今年跃进计划的实现。玉溪县热烈响应宜良县的倡议，决心今年实现水稻千斤县，烤烟三百斤县，猪翻三番，平均每人千斤粮、百斤烟、五十斤油料、一头猪。他们说一是一，按计划订出各项硬措施，把跃进计划放在可靠的基础上，在九万亩烟田里，一律留杈烟、再生烟，光这一项每亩可以多收烤烟一百斤。
    全省六十一个县（市）提出了开展竞赛的十项倡议，主要内容是：（一）坚决完成和超额完成国家规定的各项计划指标，保证按节令、按质量、按品种完成种植面积。（二）防旱抗旱，广开水源，保证在天不下雨的情况下，小满栽秧达90％以上。（三）大抓肥料，保证大春吃饱，一般田每亩施肥不少于八千斤，丰产田一万斤以上。（四）大搞深翻，改良土壤，平整土地。一般田深翻不少于六至八寸，丰产田深翻一尺。（五）坚持合理密植，充分挖密植增产潜力，各县都要订出各种作物合理密植的规格。（六）作好田间管理，制定田间管理的操作规程，健全管理制度，保证增产措施落实到田。（七）坚决开展大面积高额丰产运动，建立各级指挥田，做出榜样。（八）开展以半机械化为中心的工具改革运动，要求50％左右的稻田用插秧机插秧；全面推广使用各种新工具，节省劳力30％以上。（九）保证畜牧业高速度发展，生猪翻一番，羊增35％，大牲畜增18％。（十）办好公共食堂，安排好群众生活，厉行计划用粮，节约用粮，发展种菜养猪，建立集体家务，保证社员吃饱吃好。
    各县在竞赛书中共同指出要实现今年的持续跃进，首要的保证是继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，放手发动群众，充分发挥人民公社的无比威力，在一切工作中实行政治挂帅。从两年大跃进中，大家深切地体会到，总路线是纲，纲举目张，用总路线来武装干部群众的思想，不断鼓足干劲，力争上游，困难就被战胜，就出现一片大跃进形势。今年的持续跃进，任务是大的，也必定会有很多困难。但是大家一致表示决心排除困难，破浪前进，做好一切准备，在任何情况下，也要保证跃进计划的实现。
