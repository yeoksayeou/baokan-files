Four New News Documentaries

    Embroidery Women Workers Make a Big Fuss over Technical Revolution
    Embroidery, a work that has been operated by hand for thousands of years, seems difficult to associate with mechanization and automation in people's minds. However, the women workers of the Shanghai Embroidery Factory No. 2, who made a big fuss about the technical revolution and dared to think and act, have used their practical actions to reverse people's old views for many years.
    The theme of "Embroidery Women Workers Make Revolution" in Newsreel No. 13 highlights their creative labor. Although Shanghai Embroidery Factory No. 2 has been using sewing machines for embroidery for many years, the workers had to step on them with their feet. It is estimated that it takes more than 20,000 steps to embroider a pillowcase. This not only did not get rid of manual labor, but also could not better complete the production plan. In order to more widely meet the needs of people's lives, the factory's Party branch instructed everyone to make a technical revolution, reduce manual labor, and increase output. At the beginning, the women workers' minds were not liberated, and they did not believe in their own strength. Under the continuous enlightenment and guidance of the Party branch, the women workers finally broke through the shackles of old ideas, and in just over half a year, they realized the electrification of more than half of the sewing machines in the factory. At the same time, they also created "automatic hemming machines," "double-headed" and "three-headed" embroidery machines. Using this kind of machine for embroidery, once the motor is turned on, three bright flowers can be embroidered at the same time in a few minutes. The work that originally required three people can now be replaced by one person.
    Facts have proved that as long as women liberate their minds, work hard, study hard, and work smartly, their wisdom and talents can create great achievements.

    Oxygen Tent
    In the past, patients who needed oxygen after open-heart surgery or any other reason had to have a tube inserted into their nostrils or mouth to deliver oxygen, which made the patients feel painful. Now, the workers of the Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory have trial-produced China's first oxygen tent in the technical innovation movement. Patients who need oxygen can simply sleep in the oxygen tent, which is as comfortable as an ordinary mosquito net.
    The oxygen tent consists of two parts: a console and a plastic tent. The precision machines on the console can control the gas flow and deliver air, cold air, and hot air into the tent. The theme of "Oxygen Tent" in "Newsreel" No. 12 reported the good news to patients.

    Native Machines Bloom in All Directions
    Newsreel No. 14, "Native Machines Bloom in All Directions," introduces the mechanization and semi-mechanization of production in the Yachi Commune of Bijie County, Guizhou Province. Since the Great Leap Forward, they have reformed and created more than 26,000 pieces of agricultural equipment, saving 450,000 workdays in 1959. It is truly a miracle created by everyone, and the commune is full of innovation. Their machines are all made of wood. For example, the ox-drawn dragon bone waterwheel can pump water from the foot of the mountain to the hillside more than ten feet high. The 27 dragon bone waterwheels in the commune irrigated more than 30,000 mu of drought-stricken land in last year's drought resistance struggle.
    For example, the millstone with water for water belts and animals for land where there is no water can be driven by a horse to power four oil presses. Other tasks such as sending manure and fertilizer have been reformed with tools, and sprinklers for watering have also been created.

    Sending "Treasures" to the Door
    In the magnificent technical innovation movement in Shanghai, an unusually active team has emerged—the advanced experience promotion team of the mechanical and electrical industries, which is composed of well-known advanced producers.
    The theme of "Sending 'Treasures' to the Door" in Newsreel No. 14 reflects their activities. The team demonstrated their skills and treasures to workers and commune members from other counties at the No. 2 Agricultural Machinery Factory in Baoshan County.
    Li Fuxiang, a national advanced producer and famous drill king, demonstrated powerful and high-speed drilling. Zhu Daxian, a national advanced producer and lathe operator, used improved tools to demonstrate powerful cutting and high-speed cutting, increasing work efficiency by two to three times.
    The advanced producers also combined technical performances to teach the processing principles of lathe tools and drill bits and help the commune solve problems existing in the commune and factory production, which was warmly welcomed by the commune members. Sending "treasures" to the door not only strongly promoted the technical innovation and technical revolution of agriculture, but also strengthened the worker-peasant alliance.

    四部新的新闻纪录片
    绣花女工大闹技术革命
    绣花这种千百年来用手工操作的工作，在人们的印象中，好像很难和机械化、自动化联系起来。但是，大闹技术革命，敢想敢干的上海绣品二厂的女工们，却用自己的实际行动扭转了人们多少年来的老看法。
    新闻简报十三号里“绣花女工闹革命”这个主题，就突出地介绍了她们创造性的劳动。上海绣品二厂虽然多年来就用缝纫机绣花，可是工人们不得不用脚去踏，据计算，绣一只枕套，就要踏两万多下。这样既没有摆脱体力劳动，也不能更好地完成生产计划。为了更广泛地满足人们生活的需要，工厂的党支部指示大家一定要闹技术革命，减轻体力劳动，提高产量。开始女工们思想还没有解放，不相信自己的力量。在党支部不断地启发诱导下，女工们终于冲破了旧思想的束缚，仅仅用了半年多的时间，就把全厂半数以上的缝纫机实现了电动化。同时还创造了“自动卷边机”，“双龙头”和“三龙头”绣花机。用这种机器绣花，马达一开，不消几分钟，三朵鲜艳的花朵就可以同时绣出来，原来需要三个人干的活，现在一个人就代替了。
    事实证明，妇女们只要解放思想，努力钻研，实干加巧干，她们的智慧和才能就能创造出伟大的成绩来。
    氧气帐
    过去，心腔开刀后，或一切需要氧气的患者，须用皮管插入鼻腔或口腔中输送氧气，使患者感到痛苦。现在，上海医疗器械厂的工人们，在技术革新运动中，试制了我国第一台氧气帐。需要输氧气的患者只要睡进氧气帐里就可以了，氧气帐就像普通的蚊帐一样，睡在里面非常舒适。
    氧气帐由操纵台和塑料帐两部分组成。操纵台上的精密机器，可以控制气量，并向帐内输送空气、冷风和热风。“新闻简报”第十二号“氧气帐”这个主题报道了对患者的喜讯。
    土机器全面开花
    新闻简报第十四号“土机器全面开花”，介绍了贵州省毕节县鸭池公社生产实现机械化和半机械化的情况。大跃进以来，他们共改制和创造农具两万六千多件，1959年节约四十五万个劳动日，真是人人动手创奇迹，公社遍开革新花。他们的机械都是用木头做的。像牛拉龙骨车，能把山脚下的水抽到十多丈高的山坡地上，全社二十七部龙骨车，在去年的抗旱斗争中，浇灌了三万多亩受旱土地。
    像有水用水带、无水用畜拉的碾带磨，一匹马就可以带动四台榨油机。其他送粪、送肥等工作都改革了工具，还创造了浇地的洒水器。
    送“宝”上门
    上海市在波澜壮阔的技术革新运动中，出现了一支异常活跃的队伍——机械电力工业先进经验推广代表队，他们由著名的先进生产者组成。
    新闻简报第十四号“送‘宝’上门”这个主题，反映了他们的活动情况。代表队在宝山县第二农业机械厂，向来自其他县的工人及人民公社的社员献技献宝。
    全国先进生产者、著名的钻头王李福祥表演强力和高速钻孔。全国先进生产者、车工朱大仙，用经过改进的刀具，表演强力切削和高速切削，提高工效二倍到三倍。
    先进生产者们还结合技术表演，传授车刀及钻头的加工原理和帮助公社解决公社和工厂生产中存在的问题，受到社员的热烈欢迎。送“宝”上门不但有力地推动了农业的技术革新和技术革命，也加强了工农联盟。
