De Gaulle's True Colors Revealed

    French President De Gaulle recently made a speech regarding France's policy of aggression against Algeria, completely debunking his deceptive claim of "recognizing Algeria's right to self-determination" from a few months ago. He openly stated that France has no intention of resolving the Algerian issue peacefully.

    People remember that in September of last year, De Gaulle delivered a radio address. He stated that France "will resolve [the Algerian question] with the demeanor of a great power, in a noble manner." He explained, "I mean solving it by allowing the Algerian people to freely choose their own future." De Gaulle proposed that after "peace is restored" in Algeria, the Algerian people would "freely" choose between independence, association with France, or integration. At the time, De Gaulle's stance was applauded in Western countries. French Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet praised it as "the best solution." U.S. Secretary of State Herter praised De Gaulle's plan for resolving the Algerian issue as "a major step" towards resolving the problem. The West German government also said that this statement might lead to a peaceful resolution of this "deplorable conflict." However, less than half a year later, the French president, who once said he did not want to impose Algeria's future on the Algerian people "with machine guns and bayonets," made a murderous outcry in Algeria, saying that "peace must be restored by force" in Algeria, that military operations "must continue and must end in battle"; "France's victory by force is the only answer to the Algerian war"; "France must remain in Algeria." In this way, De Gaulle completely removed his mask. Even the French bourgeois press believed that De Gaulle was inconsistent. "Le Figaro" wrote: "Undeniably, the 'tone' has changed." The newspaper also complained that De Gaulle said, "If De Gaulle's recent remarks were only intended for the (French) officers in Algeria, why were they actually published?"

    This is precisely the inevitable result of De Gaulle's "true colors being revealed."

    De Gaulle's "peaceful" posture half a year ago was originally just an "expedient" measure to get rid of France's predicament in Algeria. At that time, France suffered repeated military setbacks in Algeria. Almost all of the army, 60% of the air force, and 90% of the navy were trapped on the Algerian battlefield. Repeatedly launched "sweeps" and "encirclements" were heavily attacked by the Algerian National Liberation Army. There was no hope of winning by force, and it was impossible to expand the war. At the same time, France's policy of military suppression in Algeria was not only increasingly unpopular at home, but also condemned by all parties internationally. On the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, international public opinion demanding that France recognize Algeria's independence was very strong, and France's situation was extremely isolated. It was precisely because of this situation that De Gaulle had to change his strategy in order to improve France's dilemma. Its main purpose was to use this deceptive means to lure the Algerian people into laying down their arms, in order to achieve the goal that military suppression had failed to achieve—maintaining French colonial rule in Algeria, and easing the pressure of world public opinion, and fooling the condemnation of the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, many people saw through that De Gaulle's trick was just a scam. Morocco's "Al-Alam" pointed out: De Gaulle's "plan" is an attempt to strengthen France's position before Algeria's resistance enters a decisive stage. Iraq's "Al-Zaman" also pointed out that "De Gaulle's plan is just another conspiracy to force the Algerian people to lay down their arms in exchange for empty promises." The Algerian Communist Party sternly exposed that "De Gaulle's statement is in fact just a new large-scale conspiracy." "Its essence is to ask our people to surrender." Nevertheless, based on the desire for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, the Provisional Algerian Government expressed its willingness to negotiate with France on the conditions and guarantees for implementing self-determination based on De Gaulle's promises, in order to lead to "the realization of a ceasefire," and formally appointed five representatives to prepare to negotiate with France. However, the De Gaulle government rejected the proposal of the Provisional Algerian Government and said, "We hope to achieve peace in Algeria through the only way we have chosen to keep France in Algeria." The French government also unilaterally announced that it would hold "local elections" in Algeria in May this year. This means that the French government authorities have long exposed that they have no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Algerian issue. It is precisely because De Gaulle's "peaceful" posture was originally a conspiracy to induce surrender, and this conspiracy did not succeed. The Algerian people neither refused negotiations nor gave up fighting; at the same time, De Gaulle's proposition caused sharp contradictions within the French ruling class and shook the morale of the French invading army, and even incidents of extremist colonial elements launching riots occurred. Therefore, De Gaulle had no choice but to hastily end his scam, revealing his ferocious true colors.

    In fact, for the past six months, while refusing to negotiate with the Algerian government, the De Gaulle government has been actively preparing for effectively maintaining French rule in Algeria. Especially after the extremist colonial elements' riots were quelled, De Gaulle took the opportunity to take a series of steps aimed at strengthening control over Algeria. In early February, he manipulated the parliament to pass a bill giving his government "special powers" and established the "Algerian Affairs Committee" directly manipulated by him, which could make all decisions on the Algerian issue, in order to act arbitrarily in resolving the Algerian issue. Following this, he asked the cabinet to make a decision to reorganize the Algerian army and police, so that these invading armies were completely under his direct control. He not only transferred some of the rioters to strengthen the French invading army, but also issued an order to expand the army in Algeria, stipulating that the conscriptable personnel and reservists residing in Algeria could be conscripted into the army. At the same time, military suppression of the Algerian people has become even more intensified. At the beginning of this year, the French government publicly announced that the "pacification work" in Algeria "will continue to be vigorously promoted in 1960." The French colonial authorities not only constantly launched attacks on the Algerian National Liberation Army, but also arrested and killed Algerian patriots, and even persecuted French people who sympathized with the Algerian people. All these actions fully demonstrate that the De Gaulle government is determined to act recklessly in Algeria to the end. De Gaulle's speech this time was just a frank confession.

    De Gaulle's "true colors revealed" is not surprising. All imperialists and reactionaries always have two sets of tactics to achieve their evil purposes. When they still believe that they can rely on force to subdue the people, they wield guns and bayonets and carry out bloody aggression and suppression; when their use of real knives and guns is ineffective, they will play with political conspiracies of sugar-coated bullets, combining soft and hard tactics; when political deception fails, they will take out real knives and guns again. As long as the invaded and oppressed people persist in fighting to the end, then no matter which set of tactics the invaders and oppressors use, whether hard or soft, they can only end in failure.

    The facts of the past few years have proved that the Algerian people are such a strong and unyielding nation. They have grown into an invincible force in the battle for independence and freedom. The Algerian people want peace, but they will never give up independence in exchange for peace. De Gaulle's "self-determination" trick played last year did not shake the Algerian people's fighting will in the slightest. For the past six months, the Algerian people have persisted in and intensified their attacks on the enemy in order to strive for favorable conditions for achieving true freedom and independence. It has now proved that they were completely right. It is precisely because they have persisted in the struggle and shattered the French ruling group's conspiracy to induce surrender that De Gaulle has finally revealed his true colors. De Gaulle's exposure of his ferocious nature can only strengthen the Algerian people's determination to fight. Algerian Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas sternly pointed out that De Gaulle's speech was a "declaration of total war against the Algerian people," "he leaves us no choice but to continue our struggle for independence." De Gaulle announced that France would "restore peace by force." The Algerian people's answer to him is: "Peace must first be achieved by force. People will only be free to express their will after force (struggle)." Peace in Algeria will be achieved sooner or later, but it will never be the kind of peace under continued French colonial rule that De Gaulle is pursuing. Without Algeria's independence, there is no peace in Algeria at all.

    The Algerian people have shown their great determination thousands of times: they will not stop fighting until they achieve independence. The final victory will definitely belong to the Algerian people.

### 戴高乐图穷匕现

    戴高乐图穷匕现
    法国总统戴高乐最近关于法国对阿尔及利亚的侵略政策作了一次演讲，完全拆穿了他在几个月前所谓
  “承认阿尔及利亚自决权”的骗人把戏，公开表明法国根本无意和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    人们记得，在去年9月间，戴高乐发表了一篇广播演说。他表示法国“将以大国的风度来解决，以一种高尚的方式来解决”阿尔及利亚问题。他解释说，
  “我的意思是说用阿尔及利亚人对他们自己的前途进行自由选择来解决”。戴高乐提出，在阿尔及利亚“恢复和平”以后由阿尔及利亚人民在独立、同法国联合或者合并三者之间“自由地”进行选择。戴高乐的这一姿态当时在西方国家曾引起一阵喝彩。法国社会党总书记摩勒把它捧为“最好的解决办法”。美国国务卿赫脱称赞戴高乐解决阿尔及利亚问题的方案，是在朝这个问题的解决“迈进了一大步”。西德政府也说这个声明可能导致这个“可悲的冲突”的和平解决。但是，事情相隔不到半年，曾经表示不愿“用机枪和刺刀”把阿尔及利亚的前途强加于阿尔及利亚人民身上的这位法国总统，却在阿尔及利亚发出了杀气腾腾的叫嚣，说什么在阿尔及利亚“必须通过武力恢复和平”，军事行动“继续下去，必须以战斗告终”；“法国以武力取胜是对阿尔及利亚战争的唯一答案”；“法国必须留在阿尔及利亚”。这样，戴高乐就完全摘下了他的假面具。连法国的资产阶级报刊也认为戴高乐前后矛盾。“费加罗报”就写道：“无可否认，‘调子’是变了”。这家报纸还埋怨戴高乐说：“如果戴高乐最近在谈话里的议论只是说给阿尔及利亚的（法国）军官听的，为什么事实上又公布呢？”
    这正是戴高乐“图穷匕现”的必然结果。
    戴高乐在半年前作出的“和平”姿态本来只是为了摆脱法国在阿尔及利亚的困境而施的一种“权宜之计”。当时，法国在阿尔及利亚军事上节节失利，几乎全部的陆军、60％的空军和90％的海军都陷在阿尔及利亚战场上，一再发动的“扫荡”和“围剿”都遭到了阿尔及利亚民族解放军的沉重打击，想用武力获胜毫无希望，要扩大战争也无能为力。同时，法国在阿尔及利亚的军事镇压政策不但在国内日益不得人心，而且在国际上也遭到各方面的谴责。在联合国大会前夕，国际舆论要求法国承认阿尔及利亚独立的压力十分强大，法国的处境异常孤立。正是由于这样的形势所迫，戴高乐不得不改变策略，以求改善法国的进退两难的处境，而其主要目的是想借这一欺骗手段来诱骗阿尔及利亚人民放下武器，以达到用军事镇压所未能达到的目的——维持法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，并且缓和一下世界舆论的压力，蒙混过联合国大会的谴责。当时就有不少人看穿了戴高乐的这一招不过是一个骗局。摩洛哥的“旗帜报”指出：戴高乐提出的“计划”，是企图在阿尔及利亚的抵抗进入决定性阶段以前加强法国的地位。伊拉克“时代报”也指出，“戴高乐的方案只是又一个阴谋诡计，企图迫使阿尔及利亚人民放下武器，而以空洞的诺言作为交换条件。”阿尔及利亚共产党严正地揭露，“戴高乐的声明事实上只不过是一次新的大规模阴谋”。“它实质上要求我国人民投降”。尽管如此，阿尔及利亚临时政府本着和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的愿望，表示愿意就戴高乐所作的诺言同法国谈判实施自决的条件和保证，以便导致“停火的实现”，而且正式任命了五位代表准备同法国进行谈判。但是戴高乐政府却拒绝了阿尔及利亚临时政府的建议，而且说什么“我们希望通过我们选择的使法国留在阿尔及利亚的唯一道路，来实现阿尔及利亚和平”。法国政府还片面宣布要在今年5月在阿尔及利亚举行“地方选举”。这就是说，法国政府当局很早就已暴露它并无和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的诚意了。正是因为戴高乐的“和平”姿态原是一项诱降的阴谋，而这一阴谋并没有得逞，阿尔及利亚人民既不拒绝谈判但也没有放弃战斗；同时戴高乐的主张却在法国统治阶级内部引起了尖锐的矛盾，而且动摇了法国侵略军的军心，甚至发生了极端殖民主义分子发动暴动的事件，因此戴高乐不得已草草结束了他的骗局，露出他穷凶极恶的本来面目。
    事实上，半年以来，戴高乐政府一面拒绝同阿尔及利亚政府进行谈判，一面积极为有效地保持法国在阿尔及利亚的统治进行准备。特别是在极端殖民主义分子的暴动平息以后，戴高乐乘机采取了一系列旨在加强对阿尔及利亚控制的步骤。2月初，他操纵议会通过了给他的政府以“特别权力”的法案，并成立了由他直接操纵的可以就阿尔及利亚问题作出一切决定的“阿尔及利亚事务委员会”，以便在解决阿尔及利亚问题方面独断独行。跟着，他又叫内阁作出了改组阿尔及利亚军队和警察的决定，从而使得这些侵略军队完全处于他的直接控制之下。他不但把一部分暴乱分子调派去加强法国侵略军队，而且颁布了在阿尔及利亚扩充军队的命令，规定居住在阿尔及利亚的可征调的人员和后备军人可以被征调入伍。同时，对阿尔及利亚人民的军事镇压行动也更变本加厉了。今年年初法国政府就公开宣布，在阿尔及利亚的“绥靖工作”“在1960年将继续大力推行”。法国殖民当局不但不断对阿尔及利亚民族解放军发动进攻，而且大肆逮捕和杀害阿尔及利亚爱国人士，甚至迫害同情阿尔及利亚人民的法国人。所有这些行动都充分表明，戴高乐政府决心要在阿尔及利亚蛮干到底，戴高乐这一次演讲不过是作了一次坦白的招供而已。
    戴高乐的“图穷匕现”是毫不奇怪的。一切帝国主义和反动派为了达到它的罪恶目的，总是有两套手法。当它还认为自己能够依靠武力使人民屈服的时候，就舞弄枪炮刺刀，进行血腥侵略和镇压；当它使用真刀真枪不能奏效的时候，就会玩弄糖衣炮弹的政治阴谋，软硬兼施；当政治欺骗失败了，它就又拿出真刀真枪来。被侵略和被压迫的人民只要坚持斗争到底，那末不管侵略者和压迫者用哪一套手法，硬的也好，软的也好，都只能以失败而告终。
    几年来的事实证明了阿尔及利亚人民正是这样一个坚强不屈的民族。他们已经在为争取独立和自由而进行的战斗中成长为一支不可战胜的力量。阿尔及利亚人希望和平，但是决不肯放弃独立来换取和平。戴高乐去年玩弄的“自决”把戏，丝毫也没有能够动摇阿尔及利亚人民的战斗意志。半年以来，阿尔及利亚人民坚持和加紧打击敌人来争取实现真正的自由和获得独立的有利条件。现在证明他们完全做对了。正是因为他们坚持了斗争，粉碎了法国统治集团的诱降阴谋，戴高乐终于图穷匕现，而戴高乐的露出了凶恶的本相，只能更加强阿尔及利亚人民的战斗决心。阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯严正指出，戴高乐的讲话是对“阿尔及利亚人民宣布总体战”、“他使我们没有选择的余地，只有继续我们争取独立的斗争”。戴高乐宣布法国要“通过武力恢复和平”。阿尔及利亚人民给他的回答是：“必须首先用武力来取得和平。人民只有在武力（斗争）之后才会自由表达自己的意志”。阿尔及利亚的和平是迟早要实现的，但是那决不是戴高乐所追求的在继续法国殖民统治下的那种和平，没有阿尔及利亚的独立就根本谈不到阿尔及利亚的和平。
    阿尔及利亚人民已经千百次地表明他们的伟大的决心：不获独立，决不停止战斗。最后的胜利是一定属于阿尔及利亚人民的。
