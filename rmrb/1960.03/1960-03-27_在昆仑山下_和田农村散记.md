    At the Foot of the Kunlun Mountains
    ——Sketches from Rural Hotan
  　By Our Correspondent　Yang Kexian
    Upon reaching the Yarkand River, eight large black characters appeared on the arches of the bridge spanning the river: “South Out of Kunlun, North Into the瀚海 (Han Hai - great desert)." The wide, flowing Yarkand River, with its melting spring waters, meandered beneath the bridge toward the Tarim Desert. Immediately, one felt that we were now at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains.
    “Southern Xinjiang is Richer than Jiangnan (江南 - area south of the Yangtze River).” This is how people usually praise Southern Xinjiang, celebrating the more than three million hardworking and courageous Uyghur farmers who cultivate tens of millions of acres of farmland in Southern Xinjiang. On these oases, half encircling the southern foot of the Tianshan Mountains and half situated north of the Kunlun Mountains, fields crisscrossed by irrigation canals are everywhere. The further we advanced, the more we felt the richness and beauty of these oases. The Hotan Prefecture at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains is such a place to linger.
    In Xinjiang, spring arrives earliest in the Hotan area. When the northern Tianshan Mountains are still covered in snow, Hotan is already a scene of singing birds and fragrant flowers. Here, there are the most grapes and melons. Even in March, we can still eat the watermelons, cantaloupes, and delicious red grapes stored from last year. If you ask an ordinary Uyghur farmer what changes have occurred in the year or so since the establishment of the people's communes, the answer is that life is getting better and better, and happiness is increasing. Every people's commune, every production brigade, and every village here is a vivid example.
    A New Type of Countryside
    The rural areas of Hotan are interwoven with orchards of fruit and mulberry trees. In the past, under the backward small-peasant economy, tree planting lacked overall planning, and the interconnected farmland was fragmented, uneven, and irregular.
    Since the establishment of the people's communes, large-scale land leveling, reconstruction of old irrigation areas, and construction of new villages have been underway. This past winter and spring alone, more than 700,000 mu (Chinese unit of measurement, 1 mu ≈ 0.16 acres) of land have been leveled, basically meeting the requirements of garden-style farmland. This year's spring plowing and sowing are almost all being carried out under the standards of garden-style farmland. For thousands of years, Uyghur farmers have been practicing extensive cultivation. This year, even the ridges crisscrossing the fields are being marked out with ropes. The land is as flat as a mirror, and the ridges are as straight as lines, which is very pleasing to the eye. In the checkerboard-like fields, farmers are also rushing to build wide, straight roads for tractors to travel on, and new residential areas are being established.
    The number of new houses built in the Fenghuo People's Commune may not be the highest, but in the three brigades of the Xiaoerwake Management Area alone, three new villages are being constructed at once. The four hundred-odd houses in the three villages are all of brick-wood-earth-stone mixed construction. According to the design, each household occupies three rooms. Some are two households per building, and some are six households per building, neatly arranged along the roadside. The walls of the houses are to be painted with black and white lime, and the windows are to be fitted with bright glass.
    Every day, farmers pass by the new villages on their way to and from work. As soon as the foundations are laid, young people come to ask when they will be completed. As soon as the doors and windows are installed, women come to ask when they can move in. While the roofs are still being covered with mud, farmers discuss what flowers to plant in front of the village and what trees to plant behind the village. Before the houses in the Second Brigade are completed, a fifty-mu orchard appeared behind the village within a few days, with hundreds of young people transplanting various apple trees.
    Just by looking at the old housing conditions of the farmers, one can understand their happy mood today. In the past, most of the old farmhouses in the Hotan area were made of wood strips and mud, without windows, only a hole in the roof, allowing only a sliver of light to penetrate the small, low, and dark room.
    The Countryside Has "Night Pearls"
    When we arrived at the Mengjin People's Commune in Moyu County, we were immediately attracted by the commune-run industries scattered along the riverbank. There are more than twenty kinds of factories here, including agricultural machinery repair, paper making, starch, sugar making, winemaking, flour milling, cotton ginning, oil pressing, and brick making. The commune can also make its own local fertilizer and local cement. In the evening, the factories are dotted with lights, which are brought by the hydroelectric power station.
    The hydroelectric power station on the Yawa River is the first power station in this area. Before it was built, farmers did not know what electric lights were all about. When construction began in the autumn of 1958, the farmers discussed it while working. Some people saw bundles of wires and said that this thing must be tied to the turbine and lit. But how the turbine could be lit, the Communist Youth League members Yiming and Riji Fu and others had not seen electric lights, they determined to find out what the power generation was all about. The Mengjin Commune saw that these young people were very motivated to work, so they left five of them to learn the technology of power generation, and asked them to be electricians here.
    "It's lit!" It is difficult to describe in any language the excited mood of the Uyghur farmers when they first saw the lights on in their houses. Hundreds of farmers shouted almost simultaneously with joy. Some people ran out of the house and rushed to the hydropower station to congratulate them and said that they were the first electricians in the commune. At this time, an old man with white hair happened to pass by and saw the lights, very surprised. He said to himself: I must figure out what happened. He followed the route of the electric light, pole by pole, to find the power station on the other side of the river.
    Today, the Mengjin People's Commune has built three small hydroelectric power stations, and has also built eleven hydroelectric stations. It uses it to drive thirty-six water mills, twenty-seven cotton gins, and some oil presses and saws for sawing wood. Uyghur farmers have already seen the days of "no oil for lighting, no cattle for plowing and milling."
    Changes in the Status of Women
    Traveling in the rural areas of Hotan, the most striking impression is the universality of women's participation in labor. In the crowds of people engaged in spring plowing and sowing in the fields, nearly half are Uyghur rural women. In the past, people thought that women could not drive large carts, but now they are driving carts in groups to deliver manure. They not only level the land, but also plow and sow, and drive seeders. In the past, there was a saying in the Uyghur countryside: "If women go to the fields, the crops will be reduced." Now, the quality of their plowing and sowing is no worse than that of men. As for the phenomenon in the old society of women having to wear veils when going out and husbands locking their wives at home when going out, it can no longer be found.
    "We are so happy that our heads are about to hit the sky!" An ordinary Uyghur old woman excitedly described the changes in the status of women to us. Women who participate in canteens and nurseries often say: "As long as we think that mothers can participate in labor, we have increased infinite courage."
    Hailiqihan is a nursery worker in the First Brigade of Xiaoerwake. She takes care of twenty-four children alone, and also washes their clothes and cleans the environment. At first, the children were not used to kindergarten life, crying and making trouble, and waited at the door every afternoon for their parents to pick them up. Hailiqihan felt sad in her heart. She thought: How can parents concentrate on production like this! She tried everything to build a relationship with the children, often bringing the fruits from her garden to the children. A little girl named Maihetumu Khan urinated in her pants. At home, her mother often beat her for this, and the child became a little dazed. Hailiqihan lay near this child every night, getting up from time to time to call her to urinate. After a few months, Maihetumu Khan changed the habit of bedwetting, and her personality became cheerful. Now, not only are the parents very willing to send their children to her care, but the children cannot leave this aunt.
    Weddings on Wasteland
    The seven counties in the Hotan area have a total of more than 12 million mu of wasteland, which is five times larger than the existing cultivated area. Before communization, farmers were still reclaiming land sporadically in nearby areas. After communization, it became possible to fully utilize the superiority of the commune, which is large and public, to organize tens of thousands of young people to form an expeditionary reclamation team. From winter to spring, they reclaimed more than 600,000 mu of wasteland in three months, which is equivalent to 25% of last year's planting area.
    When we arrived at Xiaheleke Township in Moyu County, there were 109 young people here who completed the task of reclaiming 504 mu of land in sixteen days, brought water into the desert area, sowed early spring crops such as rapeseed and safflower, and planted more than 2,000 fruit trees on the edges of the fields and canals. To celebrate the victory of reclamation, the young people sang and danced on the wasteland. Seven couples held weddings on the wasteland.
    The wedding ceremony was very simple. They bought some candy and melon seeds, and played the Rewap and Dutar under the moon and sang songs. Yimin Ahong is a respected young man here. He created a ox-drawn wooden land preparation machine, which increased the work efficiency by four times compared to manual labor. He used three poles to fix the points and made the canal ridges straight. His newlywed wife, Tajihan, also always over-fulfilled the task of wasteland reclamation. They and the other four newlywed couples were praised and rewarded respectively.
    Before liberation, these young people were mostly the children of poor peasants and hired laborers. In the past, their fathers and brothers were forbidden by the landlords to pull a single blade of grass on this wasteland. Now they have reclaimed good land for themselves here, how can they not sing aloud!

    在昆仑山下
    ——和田农村散记
  　本报记者　杨克现
    到了叶尔羌河，横跨河身大桥的两边拱门上出现了八个黑色大字：“南出昆仑、北入瀚海”。那宽荡荡的叶尔羌河，春水溶溶，从桥下曲折流向塔里木大沙漠中。立刻令人觉得，我们此刻已置身于昆仑山下了。
    “南疆富饶赛江南”。人们通常这样称赞南疆，赞美开垦南疆几千万亩耕地的三百多万勤劳勇敢的维吾尔族农民。在这一半绕着天山南麓、一半处于昆仑山北的片片绿洲之上，到处都是渠水纵横的田野。我们越向前进，便越发觉得这些绿洲的富饶美丽。昆仑山下的和田专区便是这样一个使人眷恋的地方。
    在新疆，春天来得最早的是和田地区，当天山北部还在飘着雪花的时节，和田已是一片鸟语花香。这里的葡萄瓜果最多。我们在3月里，还可以吃到去年储存的西瓜、哈密瓜和鲜美的红葡萄。要问一位普通的维吾尔族农民，在公社化一年多的时间有些什么变化？对方的回答是，日子越过越好，生活越来越幸福。这里的每一个人民公社、每一个生产大队、每一个村落，都是活生生的典型。
    新型农村
    和田农村都是果桑园交织起来的。过去在落后的小农经济条件下，植树没有整体的规划，阡陌相连的农田也被分割得支离破碎，高低不平。
    人民公社成立以后，这里进行着大规模的土地平整、改建旧灌区和建设新村落的基本建设工作。单是去冬今春平整的土地就有七十多万亩，基本达到了园田化的要求。今年的春耕春播工作几乎全都是在园田化标准要求下进行的。维吾尔族农民千百年来都是粗放耕作，今年连纵横田野的地埂也是拉着绳子打出来的，真是地平如镜，埂直如线，看起来心中十分舒坦。在棋盘一般的田野里，农民还正在赶修便于拖拉机行驶的宽阔笔直的道路，建立新的住宅区。
    烽火公社盖新房不算是最多的一个，可是光肖尔瓦克管理区三个大队，一次动工修建的就有三个新村落。三个村落四百多间房屋都是砖木土石混合结构。按照设计，都是每三间住一户。有的是两户一幢，有的是六户一幢，整整齐齐排列在公路的旁边。房子墙壁都要刷上黑白的石灰，窗户还要装上明亮的玻璃。
    每天，农民上工下工都要绕到新的村落。房基刚刚打好，青年人就来打问什么时候建成？门窗刚刚安上，妇女就来问什么时候搬家？房顶还在上泥，农民就议论在村前种什么花，村后栽什么树。第二大队的房屋尚未修成，几天之内村后便出现了一片五十亩地的果园，几百个青年在这里移植了各种苹果树。
    只要看一看农民旧的住宅情况，就能够理解他们今天快乐的心情。原来和田地区旧的农舍大部都是用木条和泥巴编成的，没有窗户，只在房顶开一个洞，仅有一丝光线穿进那又小又矮又黑的房中。
    农村有了“夜明珠”
    我们到达墨玉县猛进人民公社的时候，立即被河岸旁星罗棋布的社办工业吸引住。这里有农具修配、造纸、淀粉、制糖、酿酒、磨面、轧花、榨油、烧砖等二十多种工厂，公社还可以自造土化肥和土水泥。晚上，工厂里灯光点点，这是水力发电站送来的光明。
    亚瓦河边的水力发电站是这一带农村第一个电站，建站前，农民还不知道电灯是怎么回事情。当1958年秋天动工兴建的时候，农民们一边劳动，一边议论。有的人看见一束束电线，他们说这家伙一定是捆在水轮机上点着的。但水轮机如何能点着，共青团员伊明和日吉甫几个人也没有看见过电灯，他们下定决心一定要把发电这玩意弄出个究竟。猛进公社看到这些青年劳动干劲非常大，就把其中五个人留下来学习发电的技术，叫他们在这里当电工。
    “亮了！”用什么语言都很难描绘维吾尔农民第一次看到自己房中电灯发光激动的心情，几百户农民高兴得几乎同时呼喊出来。有的人连忙跑出房子，奔赴水电站为他们道喜，说他们是公社中第一批电工。这时候，有个白发苍苍的老人正好路过这里看见了电灯，非常惊讶。他自言自语地说：我一定要搞明白发生了什么事情。他顺着电灯的线路，一根电杆一根电杆地找，才找到河对面的发电站。
    如今，猛进人民公社已经兴建起了三个小型水力发电站，另外还修建了十一处水力站。用它带动了三十六盘水磨、二十七部轧花机，以及一部分榨油机和锯木料的锯子。维吾尔农民已看到了“点灯不用油，犁地磨面不用牛”的日子了。
    妇女地位的变化
    在和田农村旅行，给人最突出的印象要算妇女参加劳动之普遍了。在布满田野的春耕春播的人群中，将近一半是维吾尔农村妇女。过去人们认为妇女赶不了大车，现在她们成群结队地赶着车去送粪，她们不仅平整土地，而且也扶犁耕地，驾驶着播种机播种。过去维吾尔农村有一种说法：“妇女下地，庄稼要减产。”现在她们犁地播种的质量，并不比男人差。至于旧社会那种妇女出门要戴面纱，丈夫出门把妻子锁在家中的现象，已经永远都找不到了。
    “我们高兴得头快要顶着天了！”一个普通的维吾尔老大娘激动地向我们叙述着妇女地位的变化。参加食堂和托儿所的妇女也经常说：“只要一想到母亲们能够参加劳动，我们就增加了无限的勇气。”
    海力其罕是肖尔瓦克第一大队的一个保育员，她一个人照管了二十四个孩子，还兼洗孩子们的衣服，打扫环境卫生。开始时，孩子不习惯幼儿园的生活，又哭又闹，每天下午就挤在门口等待父母来接。海力其罕感到心里难过，她想：这样父母亲哪能安心生产！她想尽一切办法和孩子建立感情，经常把自己园中的水果带给孩子。有一个叫麦合吐木汗的小姑娘溺尿，在家时母亲经常为此打孩子，孩子变得有点发呆。海力其罕每天晚上躺在这孩子附近，不时起来叫她尿尿，几个月后，麦合吐木汗改变了溺尿的习惯，性格也爽朗起来。现在不仅父母亲很愿意把孩子送给她管理，就是孩子们也离不开这个阿姨。
    荒地上的婚礼
    和田地区七个县共拥有一千二百多万亩荒地，比现有耕地面积大五倍。公社化以前，农民还是在近处零星开荒。公社化以后，才有可能充分利用公社一大二公的优越性，组织几万名青壮年成立远征垦荒队。他们从冬到春，三个月就开垦出六十万多亩荒地，等于去年播种面积的25％。
    我们到达墨玉县的夏合勒克乡，这里有一百零九名青年，在十六天内就完成了五百零四亩地的开荒任务，把水引进了沙漠地区，播种上了油菜、红花等早春作物，并且在地头渠边栽种了两千多株果树。为了庆祝开荒胜利，青年们在荒地上载歌载舞。有七对恋人在荒地上举行了婚礼。
    结婚的仪式非常简单，他们买了一些糖果和瓜子，就在月下弹起了热瓦甫和独他，唱起了歌。伊敏阿洪在这里是受人尊敬的青年，他创造了牛拉木板整地器，工效比人工提高了四倍，他用三根竿子定点，把渠道田埂修得笔直。他的新婚妻子塔吉汗也总是超额完成开荒任务。他们和其他四对新婚夫妇都分别受到表扬和奖励。
    这些青年解放前大都是贫雇农的孩子，他们的父兄过去要在这荒地上拔一株草也要受到地主的禁止。现在他们在这里为自己开垦了良田，他们怎么能够不放声歌唱呢！
