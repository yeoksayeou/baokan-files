Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 23rd: The rural tool reform movement in Shandong Province, after surveying, evaluating, and appraising, has entered a new stage of development, moving from coarse to fine, from low to high, from indigenous to modern, and from single-item innovation to complete sets and systematic promotion.

    Currently, the tools for cultivation, cooking, animal husbandry, and water conservancy construction in Shandong's rural areas have been matched into four major "dragons," each of which is further equipped with several smaller "dragons." For example, in the cultivation tools "dragon," according to the processes of deep plowing, sowing, fertilizing, inter-tillage, harvesting, and threshing, each process has been evaluated, finalized, and equipped as a smaller "dragon." Cooking tools have been matched into sets according to the four tasks of grain, water, firewood, and vegetables, and the four processes of grinding, washing, cutting, and cooking. In animal husbandry, a complete set of semi-mechanized tools has been developed, covering cutting, crushing, steaming, cooking, feeding, watering, and manure disposal. For water conservancy construction, there is also a set of improved tools and semi-mechanized and indigenous mechanized tools for the four basic processes of digging, loading, unloading, transporting, and compacting.

    The large-scale tool reform has not only improved the quality and efficiency of farming and saved a large amount of labor, ensuring an all-round leap forward in production, but also created conditions for the realization of agricultural mechanization. In 1959, the province created and reformed a total of 1,500 kinds of tools for cultivation, water lifting, transportation, water conservancy construction, and agricultural and sideline product processing, promoting 27 million pieces. The labor efficiency increased by using these tools is equivalent to adding more than 4 million laborers to the agricultural front. As a result of the movement's development, eight counties and cities, including Tancheng and Tai'an, have basically realized the improvement and semi-mechanization of major tools for cultivation, sowing, transportation, and water lifting.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 23rd: In Jiangxi, an upsurge has formed in the agricultural technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on realizing the "five mechanizations" – semi-mechanization of rice transplanting, inter-tillage, harvesting, threshing, and vehicle/boat transportation. So far, the province has produced more than 40,000 rice transplanters of various models such as the "Jiangxi 59 Type," and more than 400,000 handcarts and animal-drawn carts, and has also produced a batch of inter-tillage weeding tools, harvesters, and threshing machines in advance. The manufacture and promotion of all these new tools are pushing the main processes of paddy field cultivation from sowing to harvesting from manual operations to a new stage of comprehensive semi-mechanization.

    While vigorously reforming and manufacturing rice transplanters, the technical innovation of various tools for inter-tillage, harvesting, threshing, and transportation is also flourishing everywhere. Semi-mechanized harvesters and threshing machines prepared for the summer harvest have been selected and finalized on the basis of universal creation and improvement. Among them, the "Victory" scissor-type rapid harvester in Chongren County, which has been determined for promotion, is four to five times more efficient than manual rice harvesting, and it cuts cleanly with good quality; the "Red Star" foot-operated threshing machine in Yujiang County, which has been determined for promotion, can thresh both indica and japonica rice, and its efficiency and quality are better than ordinary threshing machines in the past.

    Reported by this newspaper: The rural tool reform movement in Guizhou Province is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed. According to recent incomplete statistics, the province has manufactured more than 3.5 million new and improved agricultural tools since the beginning of spring, including more than 126,000 rice transplanters, nearly double the number of last year.

    At present, the tool reform in rural Guizhou has developed from reforming single pieces to reforming complete sets, from reforming cultivation tools to reforming all agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, fishery, and logistics production tools, and from improving existing tools to creating new semi-mechanized and mechanized tools. Taking rice transplanting as an example, now there are not only simple rice transplanters, but also hand-cranked automatic rice transplanters and animal-powered rice transplanters. The hand-cranked automatic rice transplanter created in Tongren Prefecture can transplant more than 15 mu per day, which is three to four times more efficient than a simple rice transplanter, and 24 times more efficient than manual transplanting. With the emergence of high-efficiency rice transplanters, the weak links of seedling pulling and washing are also being broken through, and experimental automatic seedling pullers have emerged. This kind of seedling puller pulls neatly, washes cleanly, and does not tangle seedlings, and is 40 times more efficient than manual pulling.

    The development of the rural tool reform movement in Guizhou has also promoted the progress of spring plowing and production. Due to the use of a large number of new agricultural tools, the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has increased the sowing efficiency of the whole prefecture by eight times, and the corn sowing ended one month earlier than last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 23rd: The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Hubei Province, centered on reforming transportation, water lifting, cultivation, and processing tools and eliminating shoulder carrying and manual water lifting, has entered its climax. After a month of hard work, Jingzhou Prefecture has manufactured 560,000 pieces of cultivation tools such as deep plows, improved harrows, inter-tillage devices, and row planters. In terms of transportation, the plains and lake areas have basically achieved one vehicle or boat per household, realizing vehicle/boat transportation. Xiangyang Prefecture has newly established more than 7,700 hydraulic processing plants, more than three times more than in the past; the types of processing have developed from agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, and oil to more than 30 kinds including industrial production and livestock feed. Wuhan, Huanggang and other rice-producing areas, combined with the current spring plowing production, have vigorously built transplanting tools, and have manufactured more than 70,000 rice transplanters.

    Currently, this movement is developing in depth.

    While reforming tools, all localities have paid great attention to the repair and maintenance of old agricultural tools. According to statistics, the province has repaired more than 1.6 million pieces of various agricultural tools, accounting for about 90% of the number that should be repaired.

    Reported by this newspaper: The agricultural technical transformation movement centered on mechanization in Heilongjiang Province has formed a climax. Up to now, the province has created and transformed more than 360,000 pieces of various agricultural machines.

    The spring sowing tool reform work in Heilongjiang began in the winter of last year. In this work, all localities have transformed a large number of animal-drawn agricultural tools into machine-drawn agricultural tools suitable for reasonable close planting and ridge cultivation; in addition, a large number of new agricultural tools that are suitable for both mechanical traction and animal power have been created.

    While manufacturing and reforming spring sowing agricultural tools, all localities are also reforming inter-tillage weeding, plant protection, and autumn harvesting tools. The animal-drawn hoe and machine-drawn cultivator currently being promoted are new agricultural tools suitable for ridge cultivation in Heilongjiang Province. The Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of Heilongjiang Province has also successfully trial-produced sorghum harvesting machinery. Some of these agricultural tools can be pulled by tractors, and some can be pulled by horses.

    In the agricultural tool reform movement centered on mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, the development of non-field operation mechanization has also been very rapid. Now, the degree of mechanization of non-field operations in the province has reached 70%. Mishan, Boli, Baiquan, Fujin, Wuchang, Yian, Tailai and other counties have fully realized mechanization and semi-mechanization in grain threshing, agricultural and sideline product processing, and feed crushing.

    With the development of the tool reform movement, mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools and improved agricultural tools have appeared in both field operations and non-field operations. These tools will play a major role in accelerating production progress and improving labor efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 23rd: The agricultural and pastoral production technical innovation movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is surging forward with frequent good news. At present, more than 60,000 Mongolian, Han and other ethnic skilled craftsmen in the region are actively carrying out technical innovation activities and have reformed nearly 100,000 tools.

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee attaches great importance to the mass movement of agricultural and pastoral technical transformation centered on tool reform, believing that this is an important guarantee for achieving a better, comprehensive and sustained leap forward in agricultural and pastoral production this year. All levels of the autonomous region are establishing special institutions with the participation of agricultural, pastoral, forestry, water and other relevant departments to lead the tool reform work. The Party Committees at all levels of Hulunbuir League are led by the secretary and have established tool reform committees, and production teams have also set up tool reform groups. The Zhalantun Banner of this league has now launched a mass movement in which everyone engages in creation and every household contributes ideas, reforming more than 6,000 pieces of agricultural machinery for spring plowing, water conservancy, etc., generally increasing efficiency by five to ten times. While carrying out tool reform, all localities have seized the work of finalizing, manufacturing and promoting advanced tools. Recently, the autonomous region held the first advanced tool contest. Zhaowuda League Ningcheng County held a cadre meeting to exhibit and promote ten new agricultural tools created and imitated by the masses. (Attached picture)

    大改农具  成套革新  系统推广
    山东江西贵州湖北黑龙江内蒙古工具改革运动纵深发展
    山东：工具配套成四条龙
    据新华社济南23日电　山东省农村工具改革运动，经过普查、评选、鉴定，已进入从粗到细、从低到高、从土到洋、从单项革新到配套成龙系统推广的新阶段。
    目前，山东省农村的耕作、炊事、饲养、水利施工四方面的工具，已配成四条大龙，每条大龙里又配成几条小龙。如耕作农具这条大龙中，又按深耕、播种、施肥、中耕、收获、脱粒等工序，经过评选、定型，又各配成一条小龙。炊事工具按粮、水、柴、菜四个工种和磨、洗、切、煮四道工序配成了套。在饲养方面，从切割、粉碎、蒸煮、喂食、供水到粪便处理，已经有了一整套的半机械化工具。水利施工的挖土、装卸、运送、夯实等四个基本工序，也有了一套改良工具和半机械化、土机械化工具。
    大搞工具改革，不仅提高了农作质量和效率，节省了大量劳动力，保证了生产的全面跃进，并且为实现农业机械化创造了条件。1959年，全省创造和改革的耕作、提水、运输、水利施工、农副业产品加工等工具，共有一千五百种，推广了二千七百万件。由于使用这些工具而提高的劳动效率，等于给农业战线增添了四百多万个劳动力。运动发展的结果，郯城、泰安等八个县市已经基本上实现了耕播、运输、提水等主要工具改良化和半机械化。
    江西：水田耕作推向半机械化
    据新华社南昌23日电　江西各地以实现“五化”——水稻插秧、中耕、收割、脱粒半机械化和运输车船化为中心的农业技术革新和技术革命运动已经形成高潮。到现在为止，全省已制成“江西五九型”等各种型号的插秧机四万多部，制出各种手推车、畜力车四十多万部，还提前制出了一批中耕耘禾器、收割器和打谷机。所有这些新式工具的制造和推广，正把水田耕作从种到收的主要过程，由过去的人力手工操作，推向一个全面的半机械化的新阶段。
    在大改大造插秧机的同时，各地中耕、收割、脱粒、运输各种工具的技术革新也遍地开花。为夏收准备的半机械化的收割器、打谷机，在普遍创造、改进的基础上已经选样定型，其中确定推广的崇仁县“胜利号”剪式快速收割器，收割水稻比人工提高工效四至五倍，而且割得净、质量好；确定推广的余江县“红星牌”脚践打谷机，既能脱籼稻又能铺粳稻，工效、质量都赛过过去一般的打谷机。
    贵州：各行各业工具齐头改革
    本报讯　贵州省农村的工具改革运动，正以空前的规模和速度向前发展。据最近的不完全统计，全省入春以来已制造各种新式农具和改良农具三百五十多万件，其中插秧机十二万六千多部，接近去年的两倍。
    当前贵州省农村的工具改革，已经从单件的改，发展到成套的改，从对耕作工具的改，发展到对农、林、牧、副、渔以及后勤生产工具全面的改，从原有的工具基础上的改良，发展到半机械化、机械化的新工具的创造。以水稻移栽为例，现在不但有了简易插秧机，还出现了手摇自动插秧机和畜力插秧机。铜仁专区创造的手摇自动插秧机，日插十五亩以上，比简易插秧机的工效又高了三四倍，比手插工效高二十四倍。随着高工效插秧机的出现，扯秧、洗秧这个薄弱环节也正被攻破，试验性的自动扯秧机已应运而生，这种扯秧机既扯得整齐，又洗得干净，还没有乱秧，比手扯工效提高四十倍。
    贵州农村工具改革运动的发展，也促进了春耕生产的进度。黔南布依族苗族自治州由于运用了大量的新式农具，使全州的播种工效提高了八倍，使玉米播种比去年提早一个月结束。
    湖北：工具改革深入发展
    新华社武汉23日电　湖北省以改革运输、提水、耕作、加工工具和消灭肩挑、人力车水为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动进入高潮。荆州专区经过一个月的奋战，已经制造深耕犁、改良耙、中耕器、条播机等耕作工具五十六万件；在运输方面，平原和滨湖地区已经基本上实现了每户一车或一船，做到运输车船化。襄阳专区新建立了水力加工厂七千七百多处，比过去增加了三倍以上；加工种类从粮、棉、油等农副业产品发展到工业生产、牲畜饲料等三十多种。武汉、黄冈等水稻产区，结合当前春耕生产，大造插秧工具，已制造插秧机七万多部。
    目前，这一运动正在深入发展。
    在改革工具的同时，各地对旧有农具的修整也十分注意。据统计：全省已修整各种农具一百六十多万件，约占应修数的90％左右。
    黑龙江：畜力农
    具改机引农具
    本报讯　黑龙江省以机械化为中心的农业技术改造运动已经形成高潮。截至目前，全省已创制和改造了各种农业机具三十六万多件。
    黑龙江的春播工具改革工作从去年冬天就开始了。在这一工作中，各地都把大量畜力农具，改造成为适合合理密植和垅作的机引农具；另外还大量创造了既适合机械牵引，又可以畜力作动力的新式农具。
    在制造改革春播农具的同时，各地还进行中耕除草、植物保护和秋收工具的改革。目前正在推广的畜力锄和机引中耕机，都是适用于黑龙江省垅作的新式农具。黑龙江省农具机械化研究所，还试制成功了高粱作物收割机械，这种农具有的可以用拖拉机牵引，有的用马牵引。
    黑龙江省在以机械化为中心的农具改革运动中，非田间作业机械化的发展也很迅速。现在，全省非田间作业的机械化程度已达70％。密山、勃利、拜泉、富锦、五常、依安、泰来等县，已在脱谷、农副产品加工、饲料粉碎等方面，全部实现了机械化、半机械化。
    随着工具改革运动的发展，田间作业和非田间作业方面，已经出现了机械化、半机械化农具和改良农具，这些工具对加速生产进度提高劳动效率将起重大作用。
    内蒙古：农牧业工具大革新
    新华社呼和浩特23日电　内蒙古自治区农牧业生产技术革新运动风起云涌，捷报频传。目前，全区有六万多名蒙、汉等民族能工巧匠，在积极进行技术革新活动，已经改革工具近十万件。
    内蒙古自治区党委对以工具改革为中心的农牧业技术改造群众运动非常重视，认为这是实现今年农牧业生产更好的、全面的持续跃进的重要保证。自治区各级正在建立有农、牧、林、水等有关部门参加的专门机构，领导工具改革工作。呼伦贝尔盟各级党委由书记挂帅，成立了工具改革委员会，生产队也设立了工具改革小组。这个盟的扎赉特旗现在已经掀起了人人搞创造，家家献计的群众运动，改革了春耕、水利等农业机具六千多件，一般提高工效五至十倍。在进行工具改革的同时，各地都抓紧了先进工具的定型、制造和推广工作。最近，自治区举行了首届先进工具比武大会。昭乌达盟宁城县召开干部大会展览、推广群众创造和仿制的十种新式农具。（附图片）
