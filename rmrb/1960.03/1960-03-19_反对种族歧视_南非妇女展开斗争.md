Xinhua News Agency, March 14th, Johannesburg Dispatch: The Women's League of the African National Congress of South Africa held a meeting in Pretoria, the capital of the South African Federation, on the 13th, and decided to launch a campaign against the "Pass Laws."

This conference, attended by two thousand South African women, decided to hold a "Day of Action" sometime next month.

The Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa also passed a similar resolution at a meeting held in Johannesburg on the 13th.

The "Pass Laws" are one of the brutal measures taken by the South African Federal Government to implement its policy of racial discrimination. It stipulates that Africans must carry a large number of various documents when they go out, otherwise they will be arrested and sent to white farms for slave-like labor. In South Africa, many African families are separated as a result. (Attached picture)

    反对种族歧视
    南非妇女展开斗争
    新华社14日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲人国民大会妇女联盟13日在南非联邦首都比勒陀利亚举行会议，决定发动一次反对“通行证法”的运动。
    这个由二千名南非妇女参加的会议决定在下个月的某一天举行“行动日”。
    南非泛非主义大会13日在约翰内斯堡举行的会议上也通过了一项类似的决议。
      “通行证法”是南非联邦政府为实行种族歧视政策而采取的残暴措施之一。它规定，非洲人外出必须携带一大堆名目繁多的证件，否则就要被捕，并被送往白人农场进行奴隶般的劳动。在南非，许多非洲人的家庭因此而妻离子散。（附图片）
