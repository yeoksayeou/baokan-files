The Women Workers of the Berlin Telecommunications Equipment Factory

Nearly four thousand women workers at the Berlin State-owned Telecommunications Equipment Factory are a dynamic main force on the German Democratic Republic's electrical equipment production front. Since the factory became state-owned, the women workers have earned honors for the country with their production achievements. Through labor competitions, they have pushed production from one climax to another. Taking electron tubes as a single product, the annual output has increased from 200,000 to 6 million in just a few years.

When we entered the factory workshop, we were quickly attracted by the women workers' production enthusiasm and perseverance. The prefabrication workshop is preparing for the production of television electron tubes. Hundreds of women workers meticulously and attentively work at their tables. The "March 8th" production team in this workshop is one of the forty-eight women's production teams in the factory striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Since this production team participated in the movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" last November, the ten young team members' enthusiasm and vigor have remained unabated. Making electron tube filaments requires a high degree of precision, and maintaining the cleanliness and orderliness of the work surface is of great significance. The production team has stipulated this as a competition content, and the team members strictly abide by it, which greatly helps them improve work efficiency. Not preparing to finish work early, and insisting on working until the last minute, is also a new atmosphere that has come about since this production team participated in the competition. Now the entire team is realizing the competition target of increasing production by saving time. They have already produced 150 fine electron tube filaments in 22 minutes, exceeding the target of producing 100, and reducing defective products.

Last year, to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, the labor competition that was launched in the factory and the subsequent struggle to overfulfill and complete the annual task ahead of schedule were unforgettable. A cadre who has worked in this factory for eleven years said that this was the first time she had seen such high production enthusiasm among the women workers. Lei Ge, the chairman of the trade union in the prefabrication workshop, recounted the situation at that time: In this intense battle, her workshop was fully mobilized. The women workers voluntarily worked overtime, and came to work on rest days without pay; in order to solve the difficulty of untimely supply of raw materials, the women workers also organized manpower and produced at night at any time. It was with this high production enthusiasm and vigor of the women workers that the factory's production plan for last year was overfulfilled seven days ahead of schedule.

This production enthusiasm was brought into 1960. Now the entire factory is engaged in the regional inter-factory competition of motor and electrical equipment factories in the Berlin and Dresden regions.

The women workers' high production enthusiasm is the result of a fundamental change in their position in production. In the Berlin Telecommunications Equipment Factory, dozens of women are serving in leadership positions as workshop directors, production team leaders, and master workers. Comrade Aishile, the chairman of the trade union who received us, is also a woman. Aishile is the daughter of a worker, and she herself has worked as a woman worker in this factory, and has been working here for more than ten years. She appears very capable in the trade union work of organizing and educating women workers; she appears very calm in her daily busy work. She is very close to the masses, and is also good at discovering and solving the ideological problems of women workers. Once, Aishile noticed a young woman worker wearing a ring in preparation for marriage, so she asked this woman worker: "Will you still work after you get married?" When this woman worker replied somewhat hesitantly "not necessarily," Aishile had a very cordial conversation with her, guiding this young woman worker to realize that the beautiful future of building socialism is far better than staying at home and only looking after her husband and children, thus changing the young woman worker's original idea of staying at home. Aishile is not only the chairman of a factory trade union, but since 1954, she has been elected twice as a representative of the People's Chamber of the Republic, and also serves as a member of the Labor and Social Policy Committee of the People's Chamber; participating in the work of managing her own country.

In the German Democratic Republic, tens of thousands of women workers, like the women workers of the Berlin Telecommunications Equipment Factory, are contributing their strength on various production fronts for the victory of socialism and for the thorough and genuine emancipation of women.

### 柏林电讯器材厂的女工们

    柏林电讯器材厂的女工们
    柏林国营电讯器材厂的近四千名女工，是德意志民主共和国电气器材生产战线上一支活跃的主力军。这个厂成为国营以来，女工们用自己的生产成绩，为国家赢得了荣誉。她们通过劳动竞赛，把生产从一个高潮推向另一个高潮。单以电子管一项产品来说，几年来就从年产二十万只提高到六百万只。
    当走进工厂的车间时，我们很快地被女工们的生产热情和毅力吸引住了。预制车间是为生产电视电子管做准备工作的。成百女工一丝不苟、聚精会神地伏在桌上工作。这个车间的“三八”生产队是全厂争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的四十八个女工生产队之一。这个生产队自从去年11月参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动以来，十个青年队员的干劲和热情始终不懈。做电子管丝工作需要高度的精细，保持工作台面的清洁和有秩序具有很大意义，生产队把这一条订为竞赛内容，队员们都严格遵守，大大地帮助她们提高了工作效率。不提早准备收工，坚持工作到最后一分钟，也是这个生产队参加竞赛来的新气象。现在全队正在实现通过节约时间增加生产的竞赛指标，她们已经在二十二分钟之内生产一百五十根细电子管丝，超过生产一百根的指标，而且减少了废品。
    去年迎接共和国成立十周年，厂里掀起的劳动竞赛和接着为超额和提前完成全年任务的斗争是使人难忘的。一位在这个工厂工作了十一年的干部说，这是她第一次看到女工们这样高涨的生产热情。预制车间工会主席雷葛追述了当时的情况：在这场紧张的战斗中，她所在的这个车间全部动员起来。女工自动加班，不要报酬地在休息日也来工作；为了解决原料供应不及时的困难，女工们还组织了人力，随时在夜里生产。就在女工们这种高涨的生产热情和干劲下，全厂去年生产计划提前七天超额完成。
    这股生产热情带进了1960年。现在全厂正投入柏林、德累斯顿两个地区的电机和电气器材工厂的区域厂际竞赛。
    女工们高涨的生产热情，是她们在生产中所处地位起了根本变化的结果。在柏林电讯器材厂里，有几十位妇女在担任着车间主任、生产队长和老师傅的领导职务。接待我们的工会主席艾席勒同志也是一位妇女。艾席勒是一个工人的女儿，她自己也在这个工厂做过女工，十几年来一直在这里工作。在组织和教育女工的工会工作中，她显得十分能干；在每日繁忙的工作中，她显得十分沉静。她很接近群众，也善于发现和解决女工的思想问题。一次，艾席勒发现一个青年女工戴上预备结婚的戒指，她就问这位女工：“你结婚后还工作吗？”当这位女工有些迟疑地回答“不一定”的时候，艾席勒和她做了非常亲切的谈话，引导这位青年女工认识到建设社会主义的美好未来，远比留在家中只看着丈夫和孩子要好得多，这样就改变了这位青年女工原来想留在家中的想法。艾席勒不仅是一个工厂的工会主席，1954年以来，她已两次被选为共和国人民议院的代表，还担任人民议院劳动和社会政策委员会的委员；参加管理自己国家的工作。
    在德意志民主共和国成千成万的女工像柏林电讯器材厂的女工一样，为社会主义胜利，为妇女的彻底真正解放，在各个生产战线上贡献着自己的力量。　（杨原）
