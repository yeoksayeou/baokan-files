    Joyfully Reading Histories of the People's Communes
    Wang Cheng
    In recent years, more than ten histories of people's communes have been published in various parts of our country, which is a commendable thing. Judging from the published histories of people's communes, their publication has spread almost all over the country. In North China, there is "The People's Commune in an Old Revolutionary Base Area: Longwangzhuang People's Commune in Fan County, Shandong" and "A History of the Xushui People's Commune" in Hebei; in Northeast China, there is "Locomotive Building in the Mountainous Areas: A History of the Huochetou People's Commune in Kuandian County, Liaoning"; in Southeast China, there is "A History of the Jiefang People's Commune" in Shanghai and "Ant Island Before and After Liberation: A History of the Mayidao People's Commune in Zhoushan County, Zhejiang"; in Central China, there is "The October People's Commune" in Hubei's October People's Commune; in South China, there is "The Rising Sun – A History of the Chengmen People's Commune on Nantai Island, Fujian" and "Heroic Humen – A History of the Humen People's Commune" in Guangdong; in Southwest China, there is "Shady with Green Trees" of the Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan and "A History of the Changshi People's Commune" in Guizhou; in Northwest China, there is "People's Communes are Good – An Investigation of People's Communes in Xinjiang." In addition, there is also a history of ethnic minority communes, "Selected Histories of People's Communes of Various Ethnic Groups in Yunnan," and so on. Some of these commune histories are written in literary form, and some are written in historical style. Regardless of the form adopted, many commune histories first denounce the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social system of old China. They are histories written by the working people with blood, tears, and hatred. It is particularly worth mentioning that almost all commune histories describe more about how they waged arduous and heroic struggles against class enemies and national enemies. The histories of people's communes illustrate that once our peasants have the leadership of the Party, they become infinitely powerful and invincible, achieving victory in the democratic revolution and overturning the thousands-year-old feudal system. From these commune histories, readers will further see how our peasants, under the leadership of the Party, moved from individual farming to mutual aid teams, from mutual aid teams to elementary cooperatives, from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, and finally from advanced cooperatives to people's communes. For example, the Huochetou People's Commune in Kuandian County was first organized by six peasant households in Luoquanjia into a mutual aid team. After four years of development, in 1952, the Huochetou Agricultural Cooperative was established with this mutual aid team as the main force, consisting of sixteen households. After more than three years of development, by 1955, when it was transformed into an advanced agricultural cooperative, it had grown to more than nine hundred households. By August 1958, it had developed into a people's commune comprising six large cooperatives from six townships. In this glorious decade, this commune was truly like a locomotive in the mountains, speeding forward on the road of agricultural socialist transformation led by the Party. Like other people's communes, this commune, from the time it was established as a mutual aid team, has been engaged in sharp struggles against various bourgeois ideologies and counter-revolutionary elements, as well as arduous struggles against nature. In this way, people have also transformed their thinking in the process of transforming society and transforming nature. The histories of the people's communes reflect the process of socialism struggling against and thus defeating capitalism in the countryside, and also reflect the process of the working people constantly struggling against nature and thus transforming the natural world.
    The histories of people's communes tell us with irrefutable historical facts that in the period of the democratic revolution, the Party went deep into the countryside, mobilized the peasants to save themselves, overthrow the landlords, and obtain land, rather than adopting the method of "bestowing" it. After the land reform, the Party did not allow the revolution to stagnate and let the peasants polarize, but instead, "struck while the iron was hot" and widely developed mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts, and through elementary agricultural production cooperatives with a semi-socialist nature and advanced agricultural production cooperatives with a completely socialist nature, as well as people's communes and other interconnected steps, successfully carried out the socialist transformation of our agriculture. In this process, the Party again adopted the method of typical demonstration and gradual promotion, guiding the peasants to "rise step by step," enabling the peasants to personally experience the facts of production development and improved living standards in the process of cooperation, and to recognize the superiority of cooperation. Therefore, the development of each step of cooperation has achieved the effect of "when conditions are ripe, success is assured." From the histories of the people's communes, we see the activities and struggles of various classes and strata in the countryside. There are contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, as well as contradictions among the people, and how the Party adopted different policies in different revolutionary periods to place the worker-peasant alliance on a solid foundation. In particular, Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis of the various classes and strata in the countryside has significant practical and theoretical significance. In this regard, all histories of people's communes have varying degrees of description, among which the descriptions in "Shady with Green Trees" and other books are specific and moving.
    From these histories of people's communes, we can see that although the people's communes have been established for a short time, they have shown unparalleled superiority and strong vitality. For example, after the communalization of the Chengmen People's Commune, due to the comprehensive planning and leveling of land, the adjustment of the use of tractors, and the expansion of the irrigated area by more than 7,000 mu, all the commune's fields realized irrigation self-flow; the organization scale was large, and the scope of activities was wide, establishing factories and livestock farms between fertile fields and orchards; nurseries, canteens, homes for the elderly, and cultural palaces were generally established, ensuring that the young were cared for, the old were provided for, and production, life, and cultural activities were unified and rationally arranged. In the first half of 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural production of the commune reached more than 1,488,800 yuan, an increase of 43% over the total income in the first half of 1958 when the commune was not yet established; the public accumulation in the first half of 1959 increased to more than 220,000 yuan, exceeding the total accumulation of the original forty-three agricultural cooperatives in three years. At the same time, 95.8% of the commune members also generally increased their income. These historical facts, as well as similar materials from other people's commune histories, are the most powerful rebuttal to those who slander the people's communes.
    All of these irrefutably prove that the glorious history of the people's communes is a witness to the victory of the Party's general line and a witness to the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It is precisely under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong that hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants have continuously moved from victory to victory and from happiness to happiness, "one step at a time," from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution.
    The writing process of the histories of the people's communes is also very meaningful. Except for a few that were written by writers and cadres sent to lower levels, the vast majority of these commune histories were written by the peasants themselves, or dictated by the peasants and recorded and organized by others. The general practice is that the commune establishes an editorial committee for the commune history, with the "secretary taking the lead and the whole people participating," mobilizing the masses to write. For example, the book "The October People's Commune" was written with the "secretary taking the lead and the whole people participating." Those who participated in the writing included the Party committee secretaries of the production teams, peasants, Young Pioneers, and grandmothers in their sixties, and so on. They showed great interest in writing their own history. For example, "A History of the Humen People's Commune" was written under the direct leadership of the commune Party committee. In the process of compilation, the commune established a compilation committee for the commune history, and each production area had a writing team. The commune members were very happy to hear that they were going to write their own history. Some cadres wrote materials until dawn after returning from late-night meetings. At the symposium, many old women wept as they denounced the滔天 crimes of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang. This all shows that in our socialist era, the working masses not only create history, but also respond to the Party's call, liberate their minds, break superstitions, and write their own history. The commune histories written in this way have many common characteristics: the content is rich and colorful, the lines are filled with the working people's high revolutionary enthusiasm, and they sparkle with the wisdom of the working people. The personalized language and the simple and unadorned yet profound narrative style in many articles in the histories of people's communes have a unique attractive charm that makes people feel particularly moved when reading them. Moreover, judging from the writing process of the October People's Commune and the Humen People's Commune mentioned above, mobilizing the masses to write the history of the commune itself is a process of "recollecting the history of the revolution, praising the Great Leap Forward," self-re-education, and raising ideological awareness.
    Of course, praising the mobilization of the masses to write the history of people's communes does not mean excluding literary writers, historians, and economists from writing commune histories or compiling materials and investigation reports on people's communes, and so on. In fact, some of the histories of people's communes were compiled by relevant professional cadres. For example, the history of the Longwangzhuang People's Commune in Fan County, Shandong, "The People's Commune in an Old Revolutionary Base Area," was jointly compiled by the Party Committee of the Longwangzhuang Commune and the Shandong Small Group for Labor Training of Cadres Sent to Lower Levels by the Central Ministry of Agriculture. This commune history is not written in a literary form like most commune histories, but in a historical style. The book first made a general investigation of the history, geography, establishment and growth of the revolutionary base area, and the development of socialist construction in this commune, and then discussed chapter by chapter the history of the period of feudal reactionary rule, the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, the period of socialist transformation of agriculture, and the first year of the people's commune. Because the cadres sent to lower levels from the Ministry of Agriculture participated in the compilation work, they were familiar with the business and brought their professional expertise into play, so this commune history was written quite successfully. It used facts and logical force to demonstrate the Party's line and policies, which made a useful contribution to scientific research. It seems that the compilation of the history of people's communes should also adopt the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," which is very necessary for more and better people's commune histories to emerge in the future.
    However, no matter what style is used to compile the history of people's communes, they must reflect the history of the working people's class struggle and the history of production struggle, especially the class struggle on the road of development of the people's communes. In the case of people's commune histories written in literary form, it is necessary to oppose the naturalistic tendency in writing methods, and also to oppose the view of compiling and evaluating people's commune histories only from the level of artistic level, and the latter should be especially noted. If it is possible to grasp the key figures and events that are sufficient to illustrate the laws of historical development to describe the historical face of the people's commune, and to make the work have an infectious charm, then such a work should be the best. In this regard, the history of the Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan, "Shady with Green Trees," has received high praise from readers. However, some people's commune histories are not like this. For example, when describing the history before the establishment of the people's commune, some commune histories have compiled more than one folk tale about the history of this commune, but not a single article about the land reform carried out by this commune.
    Related to this issue is the issue of the scope of material selection for the history of people's communes. The materials selected for the now published histories of people's communes vary: some start from the organization of mutual aid teams (such as "Locomotive Building in the Mountainous Areas"), some start from the land reform (such as "Shady with Green Trees"), some start from the hundreds of years of history or folk tales about this commune (such as "A History of the Xushui People's Commune"), and so on. Among them, the first and second situations are more common. Regardless of the scope of material selection, the history of the people's communes should be detailed in the present and brief in the past, and should mainly reflect the struggle between the two roads and the two methods before and after the people's commune movement. If it is written like the past county chronicles, it is worth considering.
    The question of whether or not fiction is allowed for historical figures and events when compiling the history of people's communes is also one of the issues that people pay attention to. It seems that the so-called "purely objective" writing point of view of "recording everything heard" is incorrect; but for certain artistic reasons, it is also not permissible to fictionalize the figures and events in the history of the commune. Because although the history of the people's communes can be expressed in literary form, it is different from novels, essays, and poems after all.
    The history of the people's communes is a new variety in publications, and compiling the history of the people's communes is also a new task. Everyone is exploring experience. Our country has published more than ten kinds of people's commune histories in a short period of time, although not every one is of high quality, but this is a very gratifying harvest. The people's commune movement itself is a great creation. If we express it in the form of books and educate readers, the significance of this work is very great. We believe that authors, reviewers, and publishers will continue to explore and summarize experience, improve the level of writing, and in the future, more and better people's commune histories will be published, and some of them will certainly become records and monuments of our great era.

    喜读人民公社史
    王城
    近年以来，我国各地出版了十多部人民公社史，这是一件值得称颂的事。就已经出版的人民公社史看来，人民公社史的出版几乎遍及全国各地。在华北有山东范县龙王庄人民公社的“一个老根据地的人民公社”和河北的“徐水人民公社史”，在东北有辽宁宽甸县火车头人民公社的“建设山区的火车头”，在东南有上海的“解放人民公社史”和浙江舟山县蚂蚁岛人民公社的“解放前后的蚂蚁岛”，在华中有湖北十月人民公社的
  “十月人民公社”，在华南有福建南台岛城门人民公社的“旭日东升——城门人民公社史”和广东的“英雄的虎门——虎门人民公社史”，在西南有四川新繁县新民人民公社的“绿树成荫”和贵州的“长石人民公社史”，在西北有新疆的“人民公社好——新疆人民公社调查”。此外也有少数民族的公社史“云南各族人民公社史选”，等等。这些公社史，有的是用文艺形式编写的，有的是用历史体裁编写的。不论采用哪种形式，许多公社史都首先控诉了旧中国半殖民地半封建的社会制度，它们是劳动人民用血泪和仇恨写成的历史。值得特别提出的是，几乎所有的公社史更多地是记述他们如何与阶级敌人和民族敌人进行艰苦卓绝斗争的史迹。人民公社史说明，当我国农民一旦有了党的领导，他们就力量无穷，不可战胜，取得了民主革命的胜利，从几千年的封建制度下翻了身。从这些公社史里读者会进一步看到，我国农民又如何在党的领导下，从单干到互助组，从互助组到初级社，从初级社到高级社，最后由高级社进入人民公社。例如，宽甸县火车头人民公社先是由罗圈夹的六户农民组织了一个互助组。经过四年的发展，到1952年，以这个互助组为主，成立了十六户的农业社，这就是火车头农业生产合作社。又经过三年多的发展，到1955年转入高级农业合作社时，它已经发展到九百多户。到1958年8月它已经发展成为一个包括六个乡的六个大社的人民公社了。在这十年光荣的历程里，这个公社真像一个山区的火车头，在党所领导的农业社会主义改造的道路上，风驰电掣，飞跃前进。像其他人民公社一样，这个公社从成立互助组的时候开始，就向各种资产阶级思想和反革命分子进行着尖锐的斗争，同时也向自然界进行着艰苦的斗争。就这样，人们在改造社会和改造自然的过程中，也改造了自己的思想。人民公社史反映了农村中社会主义与资本主义斗争从而战胜资本主义的过程，也反映了劳动人民不断与自然斗争从而改造自然界的过程。
    人民公社史以无可争辩的史实告诉我们：在民主革命时期，党就深入农村，发动农民自己救自己，打倒地主，取得土地，而不是采取“恩赐”的办法；在土地改革后，党不使革命停顿下来，听任农民向两极分化，而是“趁热打铁”地广泛发展了带有社会主义萌芽的互助组，并经过半社会主义性质的初级农业生产合作社和完全社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社，以及人民公社等几个互相衔接的步骤，对我国农业胜利地进行了社会主义改造。在这个过程中，党又采取了典型示范、逐步推广的方法，引导农民“步步高升”，使农民在合作化过程中亲身体会到生产发展、生活提高的事实，认识到合作化的优越性，因而合作化每一步骤的发展，都收到“水到渠成”的效果。从人民公社史中我们看到农村各阶级和各阶层的活动与斗争，这里既有敌我矛盾，也有人民内部的矛盾，而党又如何在各个不同的革命时期，采取不同的政策，把工农联盟置于巩固的基础上，特别是毛泽东同志关于农村各阶级和各阶层的分析，具有重大的实际意义和理论意义。在这方面，所有人民公社史都有不同程度的记述，其中《绿树成荫》等书的记述，具体而又动人。
    从这些人民公社史中可以看到，人民公社虽然建立的时间很短，但它却显示了无比的优越性和强大的生命力。例如城门人民公社在公社化后，由于全面规划平整土地，调整使用拖拉机，扩大了灌溉面积七千多亩，使公社全部田地实现了灌溉自流化；组织规模大，活动范围广，在良田果园之间建立起工厂和畜牧场；托儿所、食堂、敬老院、文化宫都普遍建立起来，幼有所养，老有所依，生产、生活和文化活动得到统一合理的安排。该社1959年上半年工农业生产总值达一百四十八万八千多元，比1958年上半年未办公社时的总收入增加了43％；1959年上半年的公共积累增加到二十二万多元，超过了原有四十三个农业社三年积累的总和。同时，全社95．8％的社员，也普遍增加了收入。这些史实以及其他人民公社史的同样的材料，对于诽谤人民公社的人是最有力的回击。
    所有这些都无可争辩地证明了：人民公社的光荣历史，是党的总路线胜利的见证，是毛泽东思想胜利的见证。正是在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，我国数亿农民从民主革命到社会主义革命才“一步一层天”地不断从胜利走向胜利，从幸福走向幸福。
    人民公社史的写作过程也是很有意义的。这些公社史除了少数是作家和下放干部编写的以外，绝大多数是农民自己写的，或者是农民口述由别人记录整理而成的。一般做法是公社成立公社史编辑委员会，“书记带头，全民动手”，发动群众写作。例如，“十月人民公社”一书是由“书记带头，全民动手”来写的。参加写作的，有生产队的党委书记，有农民，有少先队员，有六十多岁的婆婆等等。他们对于写自己的历史表现了极高的兴趣。又如“虎门人民公社史”是在公社党委亲自领导下写成的。在编写过程中，公社成立了公社史编写委员会，各生产区都设有编写小组。社员们听到要编写自己的历史都很高兴，有的干部深夜开会回来写材料到天亮。在座谈会上，很多老太婆一面流泪，一面控诉日本鬼子和国民党的滔天罪行。这都说明，在我们社会主义时代，劳动群众不但创造了历史，而且响应党的号召，解放思想，打破迷信，自己编写自己的历史。这样写出来的公社史，具有许多共同的特色：内容丰富多彩，字里行间洋溢着劳动人民高度的革命热情，闪烁着劳动人民的智慧的光芒。人民公社史许多文章中个性化的语言，平易朴素而寓意深刻的叙述风格，别具一种引人的魅力，使人读来特别感动。并且，从上述十月人民公社和虎门人民公社写作的过程看来，发动群众写公社史的本身，就是“回忆革命史，歌颂大跃进”，自我再教育，以及提高思想觉悟的过程。
    当然，称颂发动群众写作人民公社史，并不意味着排斥文艺作家、历史学家和经济学家写作公社史或编写人民公社史的资料和调查报告等等。事实上，有的人民公社史就是有关的专业干部参加编写的。例如，山东范县龙王庄人民公社史“一个老根据地的人民公社”，就是中共龙王庄公社委员会和中央农业部下放干部劳动锻炼山东小组合编的。这部公社史不是像多数公社史那样用文艺形式写的，而是用历史体裁写的。书中首先对这个公社的历史、地理、革命根据地的建立和成长，以及社会主义建设的发展情况作了一般的考查，然后逐章论述了在封建反动统治时期、抗日战争和人民解放战争时期、农业的社会主义改造时期，以及人民公社第一年的历史。由于参加编写工作的有农业部的下放干部，他们熟悉业务，发挥了自己的专业特长，所以这部公社史写得相当成功。它用事实和逻辑力量论证了党的路线和政策，这对于科学研究做了有益的工作。看来，人民公社史的编写工作，也应该采取“百花齐放”的方针，这对于今后出现更多更好的人民公社史是非常必要的。
    然而，不论用什么体裁来编写人民公社史，它们都必须反映劳动人民阶级斗争的历史和生产斗争的历史，特别是人民公社发展道路上的阶级斗争。以文艺形式编写的人民公社史来说，既要反对编写方法上的自然主义倾向，又要反对只从艺术水平的高低来编选和评价人民公社史的观点，而后者尤其应该注意。如果能够抓住足以说明历史发展规律的关键性的人物和事件来描述人民公社的历史面貌，并且使作品具有感人的魅力，那末这种作品应该是最好的。在这方面，四川新繁县新民人民公社史“绿树成荫”得到了读者较高的评价。但是，有的人民公社史却不是这样。例如，在记述人民公社成立前的历史时，有的公社史编选了不止一篇有关这个公社历史的民间传说，却没有一篇有关这个公社进行土地改革的文章。
    跟这个问题有关的是关于人民公社史取材范围的问题。现在出版的人民公社史的取材各有不同：有的从组织互助组谈起，（如“建设山区的火车头”），有的从土地改革开始（如“绿树成荫”），有的从有关这个公社的几百年历史或者是民间传说叙述起（如“徐水人民公社史”），等等。其中，第一、二种情况较多。不论取材范围如何，但是人民公社史是应该详今略古的，主要还需要反映人民公社化运动前后两条道路和两种方法的斗争。如果把它写得像过去的县志那样，那是值得考虑的。
    关于编写人民公社史时，对于历史人物和事件容许虚构与否的问题，也是人们注意的问题之一。看来“有闻必录”式地所谓“纯客观”主义的编写观点是不对的；但是为了某些艺术上的理由，对公社史中的人物和事件加以虚构，也是不能容许的。因为人民公社史虽然可以用文艺形式表现，但它毕竟与小说、散文和诗歌不同。
    人民公社史是出版物中的新品种，编写人民公社史也是一件新的工作，大家都在摸索经验。我国在短时间出版了十多种人民公社史，虽然并不是每一本都有很高的质量，但是这是一种非常可喜的收获。人民公社化运动本身就是一个伟大的创造，如果我们通过书籍的形式把它表现出来，教育读者，这个工作的意义是十分巨大的。我们相信，作者、评论工作者和出版工作者一定会不断探讨和总结经验，提高编写水平，将来一定会有更多更好的人民公社史出版，并且其中有一些一定会成为我们伟大时代的纪录和纪念碑。
