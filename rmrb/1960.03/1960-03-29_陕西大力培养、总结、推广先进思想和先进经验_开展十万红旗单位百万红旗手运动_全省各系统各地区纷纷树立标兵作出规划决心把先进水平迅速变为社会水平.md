    Xi'an, March 28 (By Our Correspondent) — The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch a campaign throughout the province for ten thousand Red Banner Units and one million Red Banner Hands. This will push the ongoing socialist labor competitions on all fronts, as well as the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements, to a new stage. The goal is to make the communist ideology and style of the advanced become the social custom and habit, and to transform the advanced production levels of the advanced into the levels of the entire society, ensuring better and more comprehensive leaps forward in all socialist construction work throughout the province. In its decision, the Provincial Committee requires all regions and industries to conduct in-depth investigations and research on the advanced units and individuals that have emerged, to grasp the advanced experiences that are decisive for promoting current work, to make summaries and promotion plans, and to immediately launch this movement rapidly.

    Based on the Provincial Committee's decision, various systems have quickly taken action. The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly proposed thirty Red Banner Units and Red Banner Hands that have emerged in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements as models. The Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Women's Federation jointly proposed ten Red Banners and ten sets of advanced experiences, which will be widely promoted in rural areas. The Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League also proposed to cultivate 50,000 Zhang Xingyun-style Red Banner Hands among apprentices throughout the province, to cultivate 3,000 Red Banner Groups that have transitioned from manual operation to mechanized operation, and to cultivate 10,000 Red Banner Groups that combine production with spare-time study and scientific research, integrating the three. The finance and trade departments have determined that in this movement, they will cultivate 5,000 Red Banner Units and 50,000 Red Banner Hands. The cultural and educational departments have already formed a model group of Red Banner Hands for workers' spare-time study, and are disseminating advanced experiences to various industrial and mining enterprises. In addition, various localities have also selected Red Banner Units and Red Banner Hands based on their local conditions, as models in this movement. For example, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has proposed ten Red Banner Units and Red Banner Hands as goals for the city's youth to strive for; Lintong County has launched a campaign throughout the county to learn from Yao Huanzhang, the model for drought resistance.

    The campaign for ten thousand Red Banner Units and one million Red Banner Hands has already been established in Shaanxi. In the great mass movement to build socialism, a large number of advanced producers and advanced collective units have emerged on all fronts in Shaanxi Province, achieving a situation where every profession has heroes, every task has models, pacesetters are lined up, red flags are like forests, experiences are complete, and everything is flourishing. According to statistics from industrial, transportation, capital construction, and commercial banks at the grassroots level and above, the number of advanced units increased from 1,170 in 1957 to 17,115 in 1959; the number of advanced producers also increased from 13,597 to 126,648 in the same period. The two combined account for 16% of the total number of employees. The situation in agriculture is roughly the same. These advanced individuals all take pleasure in overcoming difficulties and fighting against nature, and take pride in selflessness and helping the less advanced. As a result of promoting the communist ideology and style, a vivid situation has emerged in which one flag is raised high and ten thousand flags flutter. As soon as new experiences appear, they are immediately popularized on a large scale. After the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League established five columns of models in water conservancy construction, field management, pig raising and manure accumulation, and cultural learning, and promoted five sets of experiences throughout the province, within less than three months, 44,000 advanced youth collective units and more than 100,000 advanced individuals emerged.

    Party committees at all levels in the province have also accumulated a lot of experience in summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. First, they focused on summarizing and promoting the advanced thinking of the advanced, so as to carry it forward. The instructions issued by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on promoting the experience of the famous cotton planting expert Zhang Qiuxiang pointed out that it is necessary to learn her advanced thinking of striving to help others catch up with her in the competition, and the spirit of the advanced helping the less advanced immediately swept the Guanzhong cotton producing area. As a result of the 258,000 mu and 40,000 "Qiuxiang Fields" women's work groups helping and competing with each other, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 200 jin, and four groups exceeded Zhang Qiuxiang, with an average yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, achieving a double harvest of cotton and ideology throughout the province.

    Second, actively support advanced thinking and wage unremitting struggles against backward thinking. For example, when the Xi'an Railway Bureau of the Communist Party of China had insufficient self-used vehicles, it carried forward the thinking of the advanced among the staff and workers, and put forward the call to all staff and workers that "the more vehicles are insufficient, the more we must compress ourselves and put the needs of the whole country and fraternal bureaus first." At the same time, targeting the localist thinking and behavior of some who only cared about completing their own loading tasks and did not care about neighboring bureaus, they mobilized the staff and workers to launch a great debate, improved the awareness of the staff and workers of the whole bureau, established a new atmosphere of cooperation in everything, helping others, and selflessness, and overfulfilled the bureau's transportation tasks on the premise of ensuring support for neighboring bureaus.

    Third, use the spirit of continuous revolution as a guide to continuously improve and enrich advanced experiences, and to continuously advance Red Banner Hands and Red Banner Units. With the help of the factory Party committee, the Cao Guifang group of the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 has continuously overfulfilled the production plan in an all-round and balanced manner for five consecutive years. After this group was rated as a Red Banner Group in the province last year, the factory Party committee taught them to learn from Zhao Mengtao's communist style of leaving difficulties to themselves and giving convenience to others. In one year, they helped three poorly performing production groups become advanced groups. After that, 169 Cao Guifang-style groups appeared in ten large textile factories throughout the province; the number of factories that comprehensively and evenly completed their tasks increased from half to 85%. Later, the Party committee encouraged them to "go to a higher level," and this group became the initiator of increasing the speed of rotation in the cotton textile industry throughout the province. Under their leadership, textile factories throughout the province completed the 1959 task one month ahead of schedule by increasing the speed of the machines.

    Fourth, timely grasp some seedlings with universal significance, carefully cherish and cultivate them, and let them grow. The desert area in Yulin Prefecture accounts for one-third of the total area of the prefecture, and desert control is the key issue in this area. Yang Zengzhan, the director of the Agriculture, Forestry, Water Conservancy and Animal Husbandry Department of the Yulin County Committee of the Communist Party of China, studied and summarized many scattered experiences such as using water to wash sand and silt land among the local people, and created a complete set of experiences for using water to control sand and transform deserts into fertile fields in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The local Party organization actively supported his spirit of bold innovation and promoted it throughout the district. Yulin County has currently used water to wash sand to turn 55,000 mu of desert into arable land. After the province promoted Wang Baojing's method of daring to think and dare to do scientific research, rural communes and factories have established 50,000 mass spare-time scientific research offices, and more than 2,000 scientific research projects were completed last year.

    陕西大力培养、总结、推广先进思想和先进经验
    开展十万红旗单位百万红旗手运动
    全省各系统各地区纷纷树立标兵作出规划决心把先进水平迅速变为社会水平
    本报西安28日电　中共陕西省委决定在全省开展十万红旗单位、百万红旗手的运动，把目前各个战线上的社会主义劳动竞赛，把技术革命、文化革命运动，推向新的阶段，使先进者的共产主义思想、风格成为社会的风尚和习惯，使先进者的先进生产水平成为全社会的水平，保证全省各项社会主义建设工作更好更全面地跃进。省委在决定中要求各地区各行业对已经出现的先进单位和先进人物，深入调查研究，抓住对推动当前工作有决定意义的先进经验，做出总结和推广计划，立即把这一运动迅速开展起来。
    根据省委的决定，各个系统已经迅速行动起来。省总工会和共青团省委联合提出了在技术革新和技术革命运动中涌现出的三十个红旗单位和红旗手作为标兵。共青团省委和省妇联联合提出了十面红旗和十套先进经验，将在农村广泛推广。共青团省委还提出要在全省徒工中培养五万个张兴云式的红旗手，培养三千个由手工操作变为机械化操作的红旗小组，培养一万个以生产为主、结合业余学习和科学研究，把三者结合起来进行技术革新的红旗小组。财贸部门确定，在这次运动中，要培养五千个红旗单位和五万个红旗手。文教部门已经把职工业余学习红旗手组成标兵团，到各工矿企业传播先进经验。此外，各地也根据当地情况，选拔了红旗单位和红旗手，作为这次运动中的标兵。如西安市团市委已提出了十名红旗单位和红旗手，作为全市青年努力的目标；临潼县在全县开展了学习抗旱标兵姚焕章的运动。
    开展十万红旗单位、百万红旗手运动，在陕西已经具备了良好的条件。在建设社会主义的伟大群众运动中，陕西省各个战线上已涌现出大批先进生产者和先进集体单位，达到了行行有英雄，事事有模范，标兵成列，红旗如林，经验成套，万紫千红。据工业、交通运输、基本建设、商业银行等基层以上的单位统计，先进单位由1957年的一千一百七十个增加到1959年的一万七千一百一十五个；先进生产者也在同期由一万三千五百九十七人，增加到十二万六千六百四十八人。两项共占职工总数的16％。农业方面的情况也大致相同。这些先进者都以战胜困难和与大自然斗争为乐，以舍己为公和帮助后进为荣。共产主义思想风格发扬的结果，出现了一旗高举万旗飘的生动局面，新的经验一出现，马上就在大面积上普及。共青团省委在全省树起了水利建设、田间管理、养猪积肥、学习文化等五列标兵，推广了五套经验之后，到目前不到三个月就涌现出四万四千个青年先进集体单位和十万多名先进个人。
    全省各级党委在总结、推广先进经验中，也已积累了不少经验。首先抓总结推广先进者的先进思想，使其发扬光大。中共陕西省委发出的推广著名植棉能手张秋香经验的指示，就指出要学习她的在竞赛中努力帮助别人赶上自己的先进思想，先进帮助后进的精神立刻风靡关中产棉区。全省二十五万八千亩、四万块“秋香田”的妇女作务小组又帮又赛的结果，全部平均亩产皮棉二百斤，其中有四个小组超过了张秋香，平均亩产千斤籽棉的达一千三百六十七亩，实现了全省棉花和思想双丰收。
    其次，积极支持先进思想，并和落后思想进行不懈的斗争。如中共西安铁路局党委在自用车辆不足时，发扬了职工中先进者的思想，向全体职工提出“越是车辆不足越要压缩自己，把全国和兄弟局的需要摆在前头”的号召，同时针对某些只顾完成自己装车任务而不顾邻局的本位主义思想行为，发动职工展开大辩论，提高了全局职工的觉悟，树立起事事协作、助人为乐、舍己为人的新风尚，在保证支援邻局的前提下，也超额完成了本局的运输任务。
    第三，以不断革命精神作指导，使先进经验不断提高和丰富，使红旗手和红旗单位不断前进。西北国棉一厂曹桂芳小组，在厂党委帮助下，连续五年全面均衡超额完成生产计划。去年这个小组被评为全省红旗小组以后，厂党委教导她们学习赵梦桃的把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人的共产主义风格，她们在一年当中帮助了三个生产较差的小组成为先进小组。此后，全省十个大型纺织厂出现了一百六十九个曹桂芳式的小组；十个厂中全面均衡完成任务的由一半增加到85％。以后党委鼓励她们要“更上一层楼”，这个小组又成为全省棉纺织业提高转速的倡议者。在她们的带动下，全省纺织厂由于提高车速，提前一个月完成了1959年任务。
    第四，及时抓住一些带有普遍意义的幼芽，小心地爱护、培养，使其成长。榆林专区的沙漠占全专区总面积的三分之一，治沙是这个地区的关键问题。中共榆林县委农林水牧部部长杨增占把当地群众中以水冲沙淤地等许多零散的经验，加以研究总结，创造了一整套多快好省的以水治沙，变沙漠为良田的经验。当地党组织积极支持了他的这种大胆首创精神，并在全区推广。榆林县目前已用以水冲沙办法使五万五千亩沙漠变为水地。全省推广了王保京敢想敢干进行科学研究的方法后，农村公社和工厂已建立起五万个群众业余科学研究室，去年完成的科学研究项目达两千多个。（附图片）
