Document passed by the Second National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Third Membership Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, entitled "National Industrialists and Businessmen, Resolutely Respond to the Great Call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Under the Brilliant Illumination of the General Line, Enhance Awareness, Go All Out, Better Engage in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, Better Conduct Political and Ideological Reform, and Make More Contributions to the Socialist Construction of the Motherland!" (Abstract)

(1) An Assessment of the Changes in the Industrial and Commercial Circles' Acceptance of Socialist Transformation Over the Past Year or So

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country have fought valiantly and worked selflessly, bringing about earth-shaking changes and tremendous achievements in our motherland. Our country has entered a historical period of continuous leaps in production, continuous revolutions in thought, high-speed socialist construction, and complete elimination of capitalism. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, China's socialist construction and socialist revolution are bound to achieve comprehensive and complete victory.

In the past few years, through the socialist revolution in the economy and the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, the socio-economic status of our industrialists and businessmen has undergone fundamental changes, and their political and ideological understanding has also improved to varying degrees. Over the past year or so, on this basis, under the leadership of the Party and with the impetus of the working people, the vast majority of us have participated in physical labor, such as going down to workshops, going to counters, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, supporting industrial and agricultural production, and so on. At the same time, under the direct leadership of the Party organizations in enterprises, we also participated in the "Two Antis" movement against conservatism and waste, the "Two Contributions" movement to contribute skills and ideas, and the increase production and practice economy movement, contributing our strength to technical innovation and technical revolution, improving business management, and labor emulation together with the workers. On the part of the families of industrialists and businessmen, with the development of the people's commune movement and social production and welfare undertakings, many people have begun to participate in labor training, participate in street work, participate in social welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries, and participate in the production labor of enterprises run by the streets, while being diligent and thrifty in managing their households and doing a good job in housework. Among the industrialists, businessmen, and their families who have participated in the above-mentioned labor practices, some have made good achievements, and some have been honorably invited to attend local or national "Hero Meetings." Judging from the current situation, there is a tendency for the number of people who have made good achievements to gradually increase. In terms of political thought, the changes are also relatively significant, which is mainly manifested in: First, in terms of accepting the leadership of the Party, most people have gradually come to understand from the great leap forward in the country's construction, from the great development of enterprise production, and from their own practice that they must earnestly accept the leadership of the Party in order to have reliance, direction, methods, and future, and that without the leadership of the Party, there can be no way out. Over the past year or so, most people have gradually approached Party organizations and Party members and are more willing to get close to them than before, and their cautiousness and wariness have gradually decreased; in their work, they are relatively able to respond to the Party's call, obey allocation, and ask for instructions and report. Many people feel the Party's meticulous care, concern, and support, or have made achievements in their work and received the Party's encouragement, and thus have a "grateful" feeling towards the Party, and their enthusiasm has been improved to a certain extent. Second, in terms of taking the socialist road. After the anti-Rightist rectification campaign, we realized that the capitalist road was not viable. Over the past year or so, due to seeing with our own eyes the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production in the Great Leap Forward, the tremendous power of the people's communes in increasing production, building water conservancy projects, and overcoming disasters, and the increasingly high revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people, and due to the education of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we have gradually gained new feelings and understanding about the greatness and correctness of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, about who is superior between socialism and capitalism, and about where to go between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. They are more concerned about the work of the enterprise, the number of rationalization proposals has increased, and their consciousness and sense of responsibility for how to do a good job in the tasks entrusted by the Party have gradually increased, and in action, they are gradually playing the role of a socialist enterprise worker. Third, in terms of the relationship with the working people. Through joint labor with the working people, our relationship with the working people is undergoing new changes. On the one hand, we have a further understanding of the noble qualities, infinite wisdom, and revolutionary drive of the working people compared to the past, and are gradually changing our views and attitudes towards the working people; on the other hand, we have also obtained new perceptions from the working people, shortening the distance between us. Fourth, in terms of participating in labor and learning. Over the past year or so, due to the various forms of labor training we industrialists and businessmen and their families have received, the ideas of despising labor and indulging in ease and comfort have begun to undergo relatively significant changes. In terms of participating in political study, many people have paid more attention to it than in the past; through study, they have achieved varying degrees of progress; and there has been some progress in carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

All of these show that our industrialists and businessmen and their families, under the leadership and education of the Party, have made great progress compared to more than a year ago, have taken another big step forward on the road of transforming from bourgeois elements to working people, and have opened up a broad road for better service and transformation in the future. This is the great victory of the Party's general line in the cause of socialist transformation, the great victory of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie, and specifically, it is the great victory of the Party's policy of actively helping industrialists and businessmen continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation in participating in socialist construction.

Of course, while affirming achievements, we must also recognize that there are still many fundamental problems on the road of accepting socialist transformation. First, most of us still have more or less doubts and wariness about accepting the leadership of the Party. Second, in terms of taking the socialist road, most of us still have more or less doubts and wavering. Third, in terms of the relationship with the working people and the attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement. Many people are not completely convinced of learning from the working people, especially from the workers in their own factories and shops. Many people still have varying degrees of doubt and resistance towards the mass movement. Fourth, in terms of participating in labor and learning. Many people still lack due recognition of the special importance of our industrialists and businessmen carrying out self-transformation in labor, and their feelings and habits towards labor are still very inadequate. In terms of participating in political study, there are also many people who think that political study can be relaxed a little, or even unwilling to participate; and there are still many incorrect understandings and unnecessary concerns about carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

According to the above analysis, we can clearly see that over the past year or so, our industrial and commercial circles have taken a big step forward on the road of accepting socialist transformation after repeated swings, and their political positions and thoughts have undergone relatively significant changes. Most people have both capitalist and socialist sides to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the capitalist side has decreased and the socialist side has increased, but they have not progressed to the point where most people have solved or basically solved the issue of political stance. The general situation is that there has been great progress, but the situation of change is different for each of us. A few people have progressed faster and better, most people have generally made progress, and a few people have progressed slower and worse or even stagnated. Some people still have serious resistance to the new society, new things, and the socialist system, and still have great nostalgia for the capitalist system and habits. Therefore, while affirming that we have made great progress, we must affirm that we must continue to carry out the transformation of political stance and thought. We should be determined to resolutely join the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in the direction indicated by the Party, resolutely join the torrent of the mass movement, actively labor, earnestly study, and continue to work hard to gradually realize the glorious task of our fundamental transformation.

(2) On the Relationship between Service and Transformation

The second issue that was warmly discussed at this meeting was the relationship between service and transformation, or more precisely, the relationship between labor practice and political and ideological transformation. The labor practice mentioned here refers to participating in physical labor, work, and various social activities, that is, participating in all production practice and social practice; political and ideological transformation refers to the self-education of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism in political and ideological terms carried out in labor practice and political study. The facts of the past year or so have told us that labor practice and political and ideological transformation are two inseparable aspects of our acceptance of socialist transformation. Labor practice contains political and ideological transformation, and the progress of political and ideological understanding can in turn promote labor practice. This is the so-called "two legs" in our acceptance of socialist transformation. Generally speaking, among our industrial and commercial circles, most people who have performed well in labor practice over the past year or so have also made relatively good progress in political and ideological understanding; and those who attach importance to political and ideological transformation have also performed well in labor practice. This shows that we attach importance to political and ideological transformation in labor practice and closely combine the two, promoting and facilitating each other, so that we can both serve better and transform better. The facts of the past year or so have also told us that although labor practice and political and ideological transformation promote each other and are closely related, they cannot be confused. There are also some situations in our industrial and commercial circles. Some people perform well in labor practice, but because they do not pay enough attention to political and ideological transformation, the achievements of labor practice cannot be consolidated, and their enthusiasm cannot be sustained, and there is a phenomenon of being cold and hot at times. Other people, although they have made certain progress in political and ideological terms, have not invested well in labor practice, so their political and ideological understanding cannot be consolidated and improved. This shows that the two aspects of labor practice and political and ideological transformation cannot be separated, nor can they be confused, and must be well combined. This is a basic experience of our self-transformation in labor practice over the past year or so.

Through discussion and analysis, we have gradually realized the dialectical relationship between labor practice and political and ideological transformation. Labor practice is the foundation of political and ideological transformation, and political and ideological transformation is the driving force of labor practice. There is both a connection and a distinction between them. The Party's proposed policy of taking political and ideological understanding as the commander, labor practice as the foundation, and enterprises and other work posts as the base, and closely combining them, is the most correct way to solve this relationship problem. We must actively participate in labor practice, and in the process of labor practice, constantly carry out self-transformation, truly achieve taking political and ideological understanding as the commander and labor practice as the foundation, so that they are closely combined and promote each other. In this way, we can achieve better transformation in labor practice and make more and more contributions to the country's construction cause.

(3) On the View of Gentle and Mild Self-Education and Self-Transformation

For us industrialists and businessmen, the method of gentle and mild self-education and self-transformation is the basic method of accepting socialist transformation under the Party's policy of peaceful transformation. Whether to accept transformation is the first issue; what method to use for transformation is the second issue. Only when we affirm that we must continue to accept transformation, can the method of gentle and mild self-education and self-transformation be implemented; and the implementation of this method is to better realize our fundamental transformation. Without the goal of fundamental transformation, the gentle and mild approach loses all its meaning and effect.

There is no need to deny that most of us in the industrial and commercial circles are afraid of class struggle, which is a reflection of our political stance, viewpoints, and the class position we are in. The Party has repeatedly taught us that class struggle is an objective reality, and that throughout the transition period, the political struggle and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are inevitable. In fact, for ten years, we have been in the process of accepting socialist transformation. Socialist transformation is a kind of class struggle, so we have been in the process of class struggle all along. Since this is the case, why are we afraid of class struggle and feel nervous about class struggle? The most substantive issue is that the Chinese national bourgeoisie is in a position of being gradually eliminated in the class struggle. Being afraid of class struggle is precisely a reflection of the bourgeois nature of this objective fact. At the same time, many people also think that class struggle must take the form of a mass struggle with rapid and violent storms, and do not know that in China's specific situation, under the Party's policy of peaceful transformation, the gentle and mild approach is also a form of class struggle, and it is also a more frequent form of class struggle. Ironclad facts have shown that the Party's policy of peaceful transformation is unwavering and consistent. In our country, the contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie are generally handled according to the contradictions among the people, and are generally handled by the gentle and mild method. Only when objective situations such as the rampant spread of the "five evils" and the attacks of the Rightists occur, will the form of class struggle turn into rapid and violent storms. Even in such situations, a strict distinction is still made between contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people, and they are treated differently. Whether it is gentle and mild or rapid and violent does not depend on anyone's subjective wishes, but depends on the objective situation of whether we accept socialist transformation. As long as we continue to accept the leadership of the Party, continue to accept socialist transformation, and continue to serve socialist construction, the spirit of the gentle and mild approach will definitely be implemented.

The Party and the state's policy of peaceful transformation of industrialists and businessmen has always been very clear. The question lies in what attitude our industrialists and businessmen take towards accepting socialist transformation. If we realize that accepting socialist transformation is to gradually transition from an exploiter to a laborer, which is a good thing, a glorious thing, and conforms to the laws of social development, and therefore take a relatively positive and proactive attitude towards accepting socialist transformation, we can gradually transform into working people through self-education and self-transformation under the gentle and mild method. Conversely, if we regard transformation as an inglorious thing, are reluctant to hear or mention it, and hope to slip through by chance, this will make us feel passive everywhere, and we will become increasingly resistant to transformation, and finally end up with a pile of problems, forming sharp contradictions with the Party and with socialism. At that time, naturally the "wind" will not be "gentle" and the "rain" will not be "mild." Two different attitudes lead to two different results.

Experience tells us that to achieve the task of fundamental transformation in political thought and to complete the transformation of class nature, it is necessary to go through a fairly long process of repeated practice and learning. This is an objective law that no one can change with subjective wishes. We must recognize the long-term nature of transformation precisely in order to fully exert our subjective initiative on the basis of recognizing objective possibilities. We must never relax our self-efforts because transformation is long-term; on the contrary, we must constantly cultivate and improve our awareness of accepting transformation from practice, and strive to achieve the goal of fundamental transformation better and faster within the possible range.

(4) On the Requirements and Measures for the Industrial and Commercial Circles to Carry Out Self-Education and Self-Transformation in the Future

The general requirement for us to carry out self-education and self-transformation in the future is: adhere to labor practice, continue to carry out the transformation of political stance and thought, so as to gradually achieve the goal of transforming into glorious laborers who are generally in line with the six political criteria and who are self-reliant. For each of us in the industrial and commercial circles, in the entire process of transforming from bourgeois elements to working people, the issue of stance is always a fundamental and decisive issue, and this must not be shaken. Continuing to transform political stance and thought on the existing basis should still be the fundamental task and requirement for us to carry out self-transformation in the future.

In our industrial and commercial circles, there is a problem of "self-centeredness" in terms of personal interests, personal roles, and the relationship between individuals and collectives, that is, the problem of bourgeois individualism. Bourgeois individualism is a major enemy on our road to transformation into working people, and we must constantly overcome it in all labor practices to facilitate the thorough transformation of political stance and thought.

According to the above general requirements, we should:

First, resolutely rely on the Party, tell the Party the truth, and follow the Party wholeheartedly.

(1) Resolutely rely on the Party. We must be determined to follow the Party, resolutely rely on the Party's grassroots organizations in enterprises, and loyally accept the leadership of the grassroots Party organizations.

(2) Tell the Party the truth. Overcome the psychology of doubt and wariness towards the Party. Firmly believe in the Party, be loyal and honest to the Party, and strive for the Party's trust in oneself.

(3) Seriously study the Party's line, principles, and policies, as well as relevant measures, and resolutely implement them.

(4) Actively respond to the Party's call, do everything possible to complete the tasks assigned by the Party, and proactively and unreservedly contribute skills and ideas to the Party.

Second, resolutely support the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and love socialism.

(1) Actively participate in the vigorous mass movement of socialist construction, actively participate in the nationwide increase production and practice economy movement, and work together with the working people in the struggle of production, go all out, study diligently, complete and overfulfill tasks, and contribute to the Great Leap Forward. Industrialists and businessmen who have already joined the people's communes should, under the leadership of the Party organizations of the people's communes, obey allocation and work hard. We must accept education and undergo training in the great crucible of the revolutionary mass movement.

(2) Love socialism. First of all, love the factory and shop as you love your home, cherish state property, establish a sense of responsibility, and do your best to do a good job in your position.

Third, actively participate in physical labor and production practice, humbly learn from the working people, and cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people.

(1) Actively participate in physical labor. Regularly participate in periodic or non-periodic physical labor within your ability. Those who are old and weak and cannot participate in physical labor can receive education through on-site visits and other methods. Through the training of physical labor, we must establish a labor viewpoint, improve labor ability, cultivate labor habits, and learn to treat people and handle affairs as ordinary laborers.

(2) Take the initiative to work with workers to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, contribute your technical expertise and business experience, strive to put forward rationalization proposals, actively participate in labor emulation, and learn skills.

(3) Maintain good relations with the workers in your factory and shop and integrate with them. We must work, labor, and study with the workers, and learn the noble qualities of the working people, such as loving the Party, loving socialism, selfless labor, selfless devotion, pioneering spirit, and collectivism, and gradually develop the ideological feelings and living habits of the working people.

Fourth, strengthen political study, actively participate in social practice, and improve political and ideological awareness.

(1) Actively participate in various political activities, social activities, and struggles against domestic and foreign reactionaries led by the Party.

(2) Actively participate in the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works; earnestly participate in the study of political theories and current affairs policies; deeply study the spiritual essence of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes; regularly read newspapers and periodicals; and develop the habit of self-study.

(3) In participating in activities such as visits, travels, cultural entertainment, and sports, actively receive practical socialist education.

(4) Carry out criticism and self-criticism. We must often, in the process of various political activities, social activities, and political studies, link up with the ideological reality of each person, and, in accordance with the spirit of unity-criticism-unity, with family-like mutual concern and comrade-like mutual assistance, use the gentle and mild method to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

The families of industrialists and businessmen should implement the spirit of the above requirements into action according to their specific situations and conditions, and should continue to implement the policy of taking the streets and work posts as the base for transformation. Those who have already participated in production labor and social service work should continue to adhere to it, consolidate and improve it; those who have not yet participated in production labor and social service work should gradually participate in social service work or engage in labor within their ability according to their specific situation. At the same time, they should also be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, educate their children, and help each other between husband and wife to improve together and establish a united and harmonious new socialist family.

(5) On the Future Work of Our Two Associations

Based on the current situation that industrialists and businessmen have made great progress but still need to be transformed, the general principle of our two associations' work in the future is, under the leadership of the Party, to promote and help the vast number of industrialists and businessmen actively participate in labor practice, while strengthening political and ideological transformation, striving for continuous progress, and continuing to make more achievements for socialist construction. In order to implement this principle, our two associations must go deep into the grassroots of enterprises, obey the requirements of the central tasks of the enterprises, and, under the leadership of the Party organizations of the enterprises, promote and help the members of the two associations to carry out labor practice well, carry out political and ideological transformation well, implement the spirit of the gentle and mild approach, adhere to presenting the facts, reasoning, analyzing and studying more, and do a good job in ideological education; at the same time, we must improve the grassroots organizations, give full play to the organizational role of the two associations, and closely combine organizational work with ideological education work.

According to the above principles, the organizations at all levels of our two associations must do the following five main tasks in the future:

First, promote and help members continue to make achievements and make progress in labor practice.

Second, carry out political study, promote and help members earnestly carry out political and ideological transformation, and play an active role.

Third, continue to cultivate backbone members of the industrial and commercial circles, consolidate and expand the ranks of backbone members, and promote and help them play a backbone role in labor practice and political study.

Fourth, proactively and actively cooperate with the Women's Federation, and, based on the new situation that most families of industrialists and businessmen are participating in production labor and social service, further carry out family work.

Fifth, care about the lives of members and appropriately help solve difficulties to facilitate peace of mind for transformation, work, and study.

After this conference, we will all return to our respective work posts. We must turn our gratitude to the Party into strength, and, together with the national industrialists and businessmen, resolutely respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, implement the Party's principles and policies, enhance awareness, go all out, better engage in the increase production and practice economy movement, better conduct political and ideological transformation, contribute strength in the Great Leap Forward, and make achievements. In such a great era, the mountains and rivers of our country are changing, and everything is changing. As long as we persevere in carrying out self-transformation in labor practice, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and always follow the Communist Party, "remember the six hundred million people in our hearts and see the nine fingers clearly," we will definitely be able to transform into glorious laborers. The future of our national industrialists and businessmen is very bright, and the future of the people of the whole country is also our future!

    全国工商业者，努力自我改造，一心一意为社会主义服务
    中国民主建国会第二次全国代表大会、中华全国工商业联合会第三届会员代表大会通过题为“全国工商业者，坚决响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，在总路线的光辉照耀下，提高自觉，鼓足干劲，更好地投入增产节约运动，更好地进行政治思想改造，为祖国的社会主义建设作出更多的贡献！”的文件（摘要）
    （一）关于工商界一年多来在接受社会主义改造方面变化情况的估计
    几年来，全国人民在党的领导下，英勇斗争，忘我劳动，使我们祖国发生了翻天复地的变化，取得了惊天动地的成就。我们的国家已经进入了一个生产不断跃进，思想不断革命，高速度建设社会主义，彻底消灭资本主义的历史时期。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国人民的共同努力下，我国社会主义建设和社会主义革命必然要取得全面的、彻底的胜利。
    在过去几年中，经过经济上的社会主义革命和政治思想上的社会主义革命，我们工商业者的社会经济地位发生了根本的改变，政治思想上也得到了不同程度的进步。一年多来，在这个基础上，在党的领导下，在劳动人民的带动下，我们中的绝大多数人参加了体力劳动，如下车间，上柜台，上山下乡，支援工农业生产等等。同时，我们还在企业党组织的直接领导下，参加了反保守、反浪费的双反运动，参加了献技献计的双献运动，参加了增产节约运动，同职工一道，在技术革新和技术革命，改善经营管理，劳动竞赛等方面贡献我们的力量。工商业者家属方面，也随着人民公社化运动和社会生产福利事业的开展，在勤俭持家，搞好家务劳动的同时，很多人开始参加了劳动锻炼，参加了街道工作，参加了公共食堂、托儿所等社会福利事业，参加了街道所办企业的生产劳动。在参加了上述各项劳动实践的工商业者和工商业者家属中，有一部分人作出了较好的成绩，其中有的还光荣地被邀出席了当地的或者全国的“群英会”。从现在的情况看来，这种作出较好成绩的人，还有逐渐增多的趋势。在政治思想方面，变化也比较显著，这主要表现在：第一，在接受党的领导方面，多数人从国家建设事业的大跃进中，从企业生产的大发展中，从自己的实践中，逐渐懂得，一定要认真接受党的领导，才会有依靠，有方向，有办法，有前途，而离开了党的领导，就不可能有任何的出路。一年多来，多数人对党组织和党员逐步靠拢并且较前愿意接近了，唯唯诺诺、戒备心理逐渐减少了；在工作上比较能够响应党的号召，服从分配，请示汇报。不少人感到党无微不至的关怀、照顾和支持，或者在工作中做出了成绩，得到党的鼓励，因而对党产生了“感恩图报”的心情，积极性有了一定的提高。第二，在走社会主义道路方面。在反右整风以后，我们认识到资本主义道路走不得。一年多来，由于亲眼看到大跃进中工农业生产的高速度发展，人民公社在增加生产、兴修水利、战胜灾害等方面的巨大威力，劳动人民越来越高的革命热情，又由于受到党的八届八中全会精神的教育，对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大和正确，对于社会主义和资本主义的谁优谁劣，对于资本主义和社会主义两条道路之间的何去何从，逐步有了新的感受和认识。对企业工作比较关心了，提出的合理化建议增多了，对于如何搞好党所交付的任务，自觉性和责任感也逐渐增加了，在行动上逐步起着一个社会主义企业工作人员的作用。第三，在同劳动人民的关系方面。通过和劳动人民的共同劳动，我们同劳动人民的关系，正在发生新的变化。一方面，对于劳动人民的高贵品质、无穷智慧和革命干劲，比过去有了进一步的体会，逐步改变着对劳动人民的看法和态度；另一方面，也取得了劳动人民对于我们的新的观感，缩短了彼此之间的距离。第四，在参加劳动和学习方面。一年多来，我们工商业者和工商业者家属，由于受到各种形式的劳动锻炼，鄙视劳动、好逸恶劳的思想开始有了比较显著的转变。在参加政治学习方面，不少人比过去有所重视；经过学习，得到不同程度的进步；对于开展批评和自我批评，较前有了一定的进展。
    所有这些，说明了我们工商业者和工商业者家属在党的领导、教育下，和一年多以前相比较，是大有进步了，在由资产阶级分子向劳动人民转化的道路上又前进了一大步，并为今后更好地服务和改造开辟了宽广的道路。这是党的总路线在社会主义改造事业方面的伟大胜利，是党对资产阶级和平改造方针的伟大胜利，具体地说，也就是党的积极帮助工商业者在参加社会主义建设工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造这一政策的伟大胜利。
    当然，在肯定成绩的同时，也要认识，我们在接受社会主义改造的道路上，还有不少带根本性的问题。第一，对于接受党的领导，我们中的多数人还或多或少地存在着疑虑和戒备。第二，在走社会主义道路方面，我们中的多数人还或多或少地存在着怀疑和动摇。第三，在同劳动人民的关系和对待革命的群众运动的态度方面。不少人对向劳动人民特别是向本厂本店的工人学习还不完全心服。许多人对于群众运动还有不同程度的怀疑和抵触。第四，在参加劳动和学习方面。对于我们工商业者在劳动中进行自我改造的特殊重要意义，不少人还缺乏应有的认识，对劳动的感情和习惯还很不够。在参加政治学习方面，也有不少人认为，政治学习可以放松一点，甚至不愿参加；对于开展批评和自我批评，还有许多不正确的认识和不必要的顾虑。
    根据上面的分析，我们可以清楚地看出，一年多来，我们工商界在接受社会主义改造道路上，经过反复摇摆，前进了一大步，政治立场和思想有了比较显著的变化，多数人在不同程度上既有资本主义的一面，又有社会主义的一面，总的说来，资本主义一面减少了，社会主义一面增加了，但是，并没有前进到多数人解决了或者基本上解决了政治立场问题的地步。总的情况是大有进步，具体到我们每一个人，变化的情况却不一样。少数人进步得较快较好，多数人一般都有进步，少数人则进步得较慢较差甚至停滞不前，有的人对于新社会新事物和社会主义制度还有严重的抵触，对于资本主义的制度和习惯还有很大的留恋。因此，在肯定我们大有进步的同时，必须肯定我们还要继续进行政治立场和思想的改造。我们就应当下定决心，朝着党所指示的方向，坚决投入大跃进行列中去，坚决投入群众运动洪流中去，积极劳动，认真学习，不断地努力下去，逐步实现我们根本改造的光荣任务。
    （二）关于服务和改造的关系问题
    这次会议热烈讨论的第二个问题，是服务和改造的关系问题，确切一些说，也就是劳动实践和政治思想改造的关系问题。这里所说的劳动实践，是指参加体力劳动、工作和各项社会活动，也就是说参加一切生产实践和社会实践；政治思想改造是指在劳动实践和政治学习中所进行的政治思想上的破资立社的自我教育。一年多来的事实告诉我们，劳动实践和政治思想改造，是我们接受社会主义改造的不可分割的两个方面，在劳动实践中包含着政治思想的改造，而政治思想的进步又能够反过来推动劳动实践，这就是我们在接受社会主义改造中的所谓“两条腿”。一般地说，在我们工商界中，一年多来在劳动实践方面表现较好的，多数人在政治思想方面也比较有进步；重视政治思想改造的，劳动实践方面的表现也较好。这说明了我们在劳动实践中重视政治思想改造，并把两者密切结合起来，互相推动，互相促进，就能够使我们既服务得较好，又改造得较好。一年多来的事实还告诉我们，劳动实践和政治思想改造，虽然相互推动、密切联系，但是又不能混为一谈。在我们工商界中也存在着下面的一些情况。一部分人在劳动实践中表现还好，但是由于对政治思想改造不够重视，劳动实践的成绩就不能巩固，积极性就不能持久，出现时冷时热的现象。另外一些人虽然在政治思想方面有一定的进步，由于没有很好地投入到劳动实践中去，因而政治思想也得不到巩固和提高。这就说明，劳动实践和政治思想改造这两个方面，既不能分割开来，又不能混为一谈，而必须很好地加以结合。这是我们一年多来在劳动实践中进行自我改造的一条基本经验。
    经过讨论和分析，我们逐步认识到劳动实践和政治思想改造的辩证关系，劳动实践是政治思想改造的基础，政治思想改造是劳动实践的动力，它们之间既有联系，又有区别。党所提出的，以政治思想为统帅，以劳动实践为基础，以企业和其他工作岗位为基地，并且密切结合起来的方针，正是解决这个关系问题的最正确的说法。我们一定要积极参加劳动实践，并且在劳动实践的过程中，不断地进行自我改造，真正做到以政治思想为统帅，以劳动实践为基础，使它们密切结合，相互促进。这样，我们就能够在劳动实践中得到更好的改造，并为国家的建设事业作出越来越多的贡献。
   （三）对于和风细雨的自我教育和自我改造的看法问题
    和风细雨的自我教育和自我改造的方法，对于我们工商业者说来，是在党的和平改造政策下接受社会主义改造的基本方法。是否接受改造，这是第一位的问题；用什么方法改造，这是第二位的问题。只有在我们肯定要继续接受改造的前提下，和风细雨的自我教育和自我改造的方法才有可能贯彻；而贯彻这个方法又是为了更好地实现我们的根本改造。离开了根本改造这个目的，和风细雨就失去了它的全部意义和作用。
    无庸讳言，我们工商界中多数人是怕阶级斗争的，这正是我们的政治立场、观点和我们所处的阶级地位的一种反映。党一再教导我们，阶级斗争是客观存在，在整个过渡时期，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的政治斗争和思想斗争，都是不可避免的。事实上，十年来，我们一直处在接受社会主义改造的过程中，社会主义改造是一种阶级斗争，因此，我们也就是一直处在阶级斗争的过程中。既然这样，又为什么怕阶级斗争，对阶级斗争感到紧张呢？最实质的问题，是中国民族资产阶级在阶级斗争中处于逐步被消灭的地位，怕阶级斗争，正是资产阶级本质对于这一客观事实的反映。同时很多人还以为阶级斗争一定要采取急风暴雨的群众斗争的形式，不知道在我国的具体情况下，在党的和平改造的方针下，和风细雨也是阶级斗争的一种形式，而且还是一种更为经常的阶级斗争的形式。铁一般的事实说明了，党的和平改造政策是坚定不移、始终如一的。在我们国家里，工人阶级同民族资产阶级之间的矛盾，一般是按照人民内部矛盾来处理的，并且一般是采取和风细雨的方法来处理的。只是出现了像五毒泛滥和右派进攻那样的客观情况，阶级斗争的形式才转为急风暴雨，就在那样的情况下，也还是严格分清敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，加以区别对待的。和风细雨还是急风暴雨，决不取决于任何人的主观愿望，而取决于我们是不是接受社会主义改造的客观情况。只要我们继续接受党的领导，继续接受社会主义改造，继续为社会主义建设服务，和风细雨的精神是一定会贯彻下去的。
    党和国家对工商业者和平改造的方针，一直是十分明确的。问题在于我们工商业者对于接受社会主义改造采取什么态度。如果我们认识到，接受社会主义改造就是要从剥削者逐步向劳动者过渡，是一件好事，是一件光荣的事情，是符合社会发展规律的，因而，对接受社会主义改造采取比较积极、主动的态度，就能够在和风细雨的方法下，通过自我教育和自我改造，逐步转化为劳动人民。反之，如果我们把改造当做不光彩的事情，厌听怕提，希望侥幸滑过去，这就会使我们处处感到被动，对改造越来越抵触，终于弄得问题成堆，形成对党、对社会主义的尖锐的矛盾。那时，自然“风”也“和”不了，“雨”也“细”不了。两种不同的态度，得到两种不同的结果。
    经验告诉我们，要在政治思想上实现根本改造的任务，要完成阶级本质的改造，需要经过一个相当长期的反复实践和学习的过程。这是一个客观的规律，不是任何人凭主观愿望可以改变的。我们要认识改造的长期性，正是为了在认清客观可能性的基础上，充分发挥我们的主观能动性，决不能因为改造是长期的，放松自我努力；相反的，必须不断地从实践中培养、提高我们接受改造的自觉，力争在可能的范围内较好较快地实现根本改造的目的。
   （四）关于工商界今后进行自我教育和自我改造的要求和措施问题
    我们今后进行自我教育和自我改造总的要求是：坚持劳动实践，继续进行政治立场和思想的改造，以逐步达到改造成为大体上符合六条政治标准、自食其力的光荣的劳动者的目标。对于我们工商界每一个人说来，在从资产阶级分子向劳动人民转化的全部过程中，立场问题始终是具有根本意义的和决定意义的问题，这一点决不能动摇。在现有的基础上继续改造政治立场和思想，仍然应当是我们今后进行自我改造的根本任务和要求。
    在我们工商界中，在对待个人利益、个人作用和个人与集体的关系等方面，都存在着一个“我字当头”问题，也就是资产阶级个人主义问题。资产阶级个人主义是我们向劳动人民转化道路上的大敌，我们必须在一切的劳动实践中不断地加以克服，以利于政治立场和思想的彻底改造。
    根据上述总的要求，我们应当：
    第一，坚决依靠党，向党说真话，一心一意跟党走。
    （1）坚决依靠党。我们要下定决心跟党走，要坚决依靠企业里党的基层组织，忠诚地接受基层党组织的领导。
    （2）向党说真话。克服对党疑虑、戒备的心理。坚决相信党，对党忠诚老实，争取党对自己的信任。
    （3）认真钻研党的路线、方针、政策以及有关的措施，并且坚决地贯彻执行。
    （4）积极响应党的号召，千方百计地完成党所交给的任务，主动积极地、无保留地向党献技、献计。
    第二，坚决拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社，热爱社会主义。
    （1）积极投入轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设的群众运动中去，积极投入全民性的增产节约运动中去，在生产斗争中同劳动人民一道，鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，完成和超额完成任务，为大跃进作出贡献。已经参加人民公社的工商业者，应当在人民公社党组织的领导下，服从分配，努力工作。要在革命群众运动的伟大的熔炉中，接受教育，经受锻炼。
      （2）热爱社会主义。首先做到爱厂爱店如爱家，爱护国家财产，树立责任感，尽心竭力地做好本岗位工作。
    第三，积极参加体力劳动和生产实践，虚心向劳动人民学习，培养劳动人民的思想感情。
      （1）积极参加体力劳动。经常参加力所能及的定期的或者不定期的体力劳动，年老、体弱不能参加体力劳动的，可以通过现场参观等方式，接受教育。要通过体力劳动的锻炼，树立劳动观点，提高劳动能力，培养劳动习惯，并学会以普通劳动者的身分待人处事。
      （2）主动同工人一起大闹技术革新和技术革命，贡献自己的技术专长和业务经验，努力提出合理化建议，积极参加劳动竞赛，学习技能。
      （3）同本厂本店工人搞好关系，打成一片。要和工人同工作，同劳动，同学习，学习劳动人民的热爱党、热爱社会主义、忘我劳动、大公无私、首创精神、集体主义等高贵品质，逐步养成劳动人民的思想感情、生活习惯。
    第四，加强政治学习，积极参加社会实践，提高政治思想觉悟。
      （1）积极参加党所领导的各种政治活动、社会活动以及对国内外反动派的斗争。
      （2）积极投入学习毛泽东主席的著作的热潮；认真参加政治理论和时事政策的学习；深入学习总路线、大跃进、人民公社的精神实质；经常阅读报刊；养成自学的习惯。
      （3）在参加参观、访问、旅行、文化娱乐、体育等活动中，积极接受社会主义的实际教育。
      （4）开展批评和自我批评。要经常在各种政治活动、社会活动以及政治学习的过程中，联系各人的思想实际，根据团结——批评——团结的精神，以家人般的相互关切和同志式的相互帮助，用和风细雨的方法，开展批评和自我批评。
    工商业者家属要根据自己的具体情况和条件，把上述要求的精神贯彻到行动中去，要继续贯彻以街道和工作岗位为改造基地的方针。已经参加生产劳动和社会服务工作的，要继续坚持下去，并巩固提高；尚未参加生产劳动和社会服务工作的，要根据各人具体情况，量力而行，逐步参加社会服务工作，或者从事力所能及的劳动。同时还要勤俭持家，教育子女，夫妻之间要相互帮助，共同提高，建立团结和睦的社会主义新家庭。
          （五）关于我们两会今后的工作问题
    根据工商业者目前大有进步、还要改造的情况，今后我们两会的工作方针，总的说来，是在党的领导下，推动和帮助广大工商业者积极参加劳动实践，同时加强政治思想改造，争取不断进步，继续为社会主义建设做出更多的成绩。为了贯彻这个方针，我们两会必须深入企业基层，服从企业中心任务的要求，在企业党组织的领导下，推动和帮助两会成员很好地进行劳动实践，很好地进行政治思想改造，贯彻和风细雨的精神，坚持摆事实、讲道理、多分析、多研究，做好思想教育工作；同时，必须健全基层组织，充分发挥两会的组织作用，把组织工作和思想教育工作密切结合起来。
    根据以上方针，今后我们两会各级组织必须做好以下五个方面的主要工作：
    第一，推动和帮助成员在劳动实践中继续作出成绩，取得进步。
    第二，开展政治学习，推动和帮助成员认真地进行政治思想改造，发挥积极作用。
    第三，继续培养工商界骨干分子，巩固和扩大骨干分子队伍，推动和帮助他们在劳动实践和政治学习中发挥骨干作用。
    第四，主动积极配合妇女联合会，根据目前工商业者家属多数人参加生产劳动和社会服务的新情况，进一步开展家属工作。
    第五，关心成员生活，适当地帮助解决困难，以利于安心改造、安心工作、安心学习。
    这次大会以后，我们都要回到各自的工作岗位，我们要把对党的感激的心情化为力量，同全国工商业者一道，坚决响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，在总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻党的方针、政策，提高自觉，鼓足干劲，更好地投入增产节约运动，更好地进行政治思想改造，在大跃进中贡献力量，作出成绩。在这样伟大的时代里，我们国家的山在变，水在变，一切都在变。我们只要坚持不懈地在劳动实践中进行自我改造，永远听毛主席的话，永远跟共产党走，“一心记住六亿人口，两眼看清九个指头”，我们一定能够转变成为光荣的劳动者。我们民族工商业者的前途是十分光明的，全国人民的前途也就是我们的前途！
