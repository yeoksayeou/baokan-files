Do Everything Possible to Be a Good Assistant to the Party Organization in the People's Economic Life
Kongjiang Store is a Good Steward for Residents

(According to our report) The Kongjiang Store in Shanghai conscientiously implements the policy of "serving the life of workers in new villages in every possible way." Under the leadership of the local Party organization, it fully mobilizes and relies on the masses inside and outside the store, striving to improve supply and service work and organize the people's economic life. It is known as the "good steward" of the new village residents.

Kongjiang Store is a comprehensive state-owned retail store, responsible for the supply of daily necessities and life services for nearly 90,000 residents in Kongjiang and nearby Fengcheng, Fengnan, and other 14 workers' new villages. The store operates more than 21,000 kinds of commodities, from small hairpins and safety pins to high-end clothing and complete sets of furniture; it also has dining halls, snack bars, barber shops, laundry groups, photo studios, bathrooms, and repair shops. The eating, wearing, and using commodities and repairing, patching, washing, and dyeing services needed by residents are almost all available. The characteristics of this "good steward" for 90,000 people are: knowing the family assets well, being clear about everything, caring for family members, and being considerate and meticulous. Therefore, the store has become the center of the economic life of the new village residents.

Kongjiang Store has taken a series of measures in serving the life of workers in new villages and organizing the economic life of residents.

　　Understand Needs and Supply in Many Ways
　　Publicize Policies and Guide Consumption

In order to manage this "family" well, the staff first conducted detailed investigations, studied consumption patterns, and understood the "family" assets. The store often solicits consumers' opinions and needs by setting up shortage registration books, holding resident forums, and visiting homes. Kongjiang Store basically knows the income of workers in which industries in the surrounding 14 workers' new villages, when they get paid; how many adults and children are in the village, as well as the population changes and consumption habits of the new village residents. Based on these situations, the store organizes supplies purposefully and improves service work in a timely manner.

Doing everything possible to facilitate residents, caring for and caring for residents as if they were relatives, is a major feature of Kongjiang Store. Salespersons go out of the counter and take the initiative to serve residents. If a family has a lying-in woman or a patient, they promptly send some nutritious food or medicine to their door. Since this year alone, the store has delivered goods to the homes of old, weak, sick, disabled residents and lying-in women more than 16,000 times. Workers produce in three shifts, and the store is open day and night. Night shift workers can still eat hot snacks in the store's snack bar at two or three o'clock in the morning when they go home. Seeing that it is inconvenient for residents to buy vegetables in the morning, they increase the number of people, scales, and stalls in the vegetable market and implement mobile supply to meet the needs of residents. Residents reflected that there was nowhere to repair the broken utensils, so the store actively opened repair services. A comprehensive repair shop with more than 70 repair projects was established, ranging from repairing high-end and complex radios, clocks, and bicycles to sharpening kitchen knives and threading toothbrushes. In order to repair problems such as broken filaments in light bulbs for residents, the salesperson specially went to Nanjing to learn light bulb repair technology. The repair shop also set up stalls in the vegetable market and sent people to carry burdens and boxes to repair door-to-door, which is convenient for the masses. Adapting to the diverse needs of residents' lives, Kongjiang Store also expanded its service business of selling newspapers and periodicals, stamps, and monthly public vehicle tickets; it also opened a comprehensive recreation room with air guns, tensile machines, and other recreational supplies, which is very popular among residents.

The area served by Kongjiang Store covers 15 square kilometers. In order to facilitate residents' purchases as much as possible, while increasing the number of supply points as much as possible, the store also took the mass line and relied on village residents' organizations (i.e., neighborhood committees) to open 23 resident consignment stores, entrusting them to sell a part of the residents' daily necessities, to make up for the lack of commercial outlets. Now Kongjiang Store has 67 supply points of various kinds, and residents can generally buy things within three to five minutes' walk. After adopting this measure, the layout of the commercial network basically achieved a combination of large, medium, and small types and a combination of centralized and decentralized; there are not only large shopping malls with a large variety of commodities; but also medium-sized stores that operate general food, clothing, and consumer goods, with a certain number of varieties, distributed in certain sections; there are also scattered small stores and consignment stores that operate daily necessities such as food, groceries, small department stores, oil, sauce, etc., which basically meet the needs of the current supply and service work.

Kongjiang Store not only cares about residents' lives and provides thoughtful services to residents, but also pays special attention to organizing residents' lives and guiding consumption. Salespersons make friends with residents and conduct economic publicity to the masses at any time through home visits and casual conversations. Last summer, the supply of straw mats could not meet the needs for a time. The store used a combination of supplying commodities and guiding consumption to convene a residents' forum to explain the country's commodity supply policy and introduce the source of goods to everyone, gaining the support and assistance of the masses. The residents themselves discussed the supply of straw mats to the most urgent people; at the same time, the store vigorously carried out the repair of old mats. With this approach, the residents are generally satisfied, and some even voluntarily transfer the purchased straw mats to those in urgent need. Kongjiang Store salespersons also often study the performance of commodities, impart storage knowledge to customers, and help them to calculate carefully and act as their "advisers."

　　Support Residents' Self-service
　　Actively Impart Business Technology

While improving its own supply and service work, Kongjiang Store, under the leadership of the local Party and government departments, supports and promotes the collective life service undertakings of new village residents, and meets part of the needs in life through mass self-service. This is an important part of Kongjiang Store's organization of the economic life of new village residents. Under the leadership of the Party, the store and the new village residents' organization jointly formed an "Organizing People's Economic Life Management Committee" to strengthen the arrangement of this work. Up to now, they have helped residents to set up more than 30 collective life service organizations that are needed by the masses and have the conditions to run, such as canteens, barber shops, and repair shops; the store also constantly provides guidance and assistance in business technology, management, raw material and equipment supply, etc., to promote these organizations to consolidate and develop rapidly. At the beginning of the establishment of the residents' canteen, the meals were not well done due to the lack of experience of the cooks. The store specially organized a cook training class for the canteen and sent excellent chefs to teach them cooking skills and assist in arranging the menu. With the support of the store, the quality of the residents' canteen meals has been greatly improved. Now it can supply at least a dozen dishes every day, and as many as 30 kinds, and the number of residents who board meals has increased rapidly. The store not only helped residents organize the training of barbers and opened four private barber shops, but also took the initiative to train some nannies to cut hair for children in kindergartens. The store also helped residents organize the processing and manufacture of five hot water stoves and opened five private hot water shops urgently needed by the masses in new villages such as Kongjiang and Fengcheng. The store's financial accounting cadres also often go to residents' canteens, nurseries and other private service organizations to help do a good job in financial management. In order to further meet the various needs of the masses in life, Kongjiang Store has recently assisted the new village residents' organization in carrying out the pilot work of "life service personnel" among the masses. Taking houses as units, a "life service person" is selected from the residents to help each household in this building to take care of part of the housework, such as cleaning rooms, buying things on behalf of others, collecting water and electricity bills, and picking up and dropping off children from nurseries. This new measure not only greatly facilitates residents, enables more housewives to get rid of the burden of housework and participate in production, but also further promotes the new atmosphere of mutual assistance, unity and harmony among neighbors.

After Kongjiang Store adopted the above measures, a new type of relationship like a family appeared between the store and the residents. Residents are happy to help the store with supply and service work. Before the Spring Festival this year, the store's supply work was busy and there were not enough staff. Cadres of new village residents' organizations and some residents voluntarily went to the store to help pack New Year goods and maintain order. Jiang Rongfa, a retired old worker from the Second Village of Kongjiang New Village, has been helping with some light chores in the store's snack bar every day in recent years. He said: "The factory belongs to the country, and the store also belongs to the country. Although I am not producing in the factory, it is right to help the store with some light work."

　　Politics Takes Command and Clarifies Tasks
　　Rely on the Masses Inside and Outside the Store

The achievements of Kongjiang Store in organizing the economic life of new village residents are first of all the result of strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to the principle of putting politics in command. During the rectification movement, all employees, after debate, clarified that the main task of the store is to serve the workers and their families in the new village, and this is also to serve production. Later, everyone unanimously realized that all items closely related to residents' lives, as long as there are conditions, should be operated; only in this way can we truly be a "steward" for the masses. On the basis of improving the understanding of employees, Kongjiang Store adopted the method of mobilizing store employees and relying closely on new village residents, fully mobilizing the positive factors of all parties, so that the work can continue to move forward. The entire staff of Kongjiang Store is less than 900 people, and the ratio to the 90,000 residents of the new village is 1 to 100. The key to the store being praised as a "good steward" lies in the implementation of the Party's mass line.

Kongjiang Store has become a banner among the stores in the workers' new village in Shanghai. The Finance and Trade Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee recently introduced the advanced experience of this store at the commercial work conference in the new industrial zone and workers' new village area. Now, a competition of "comparing with Kongjiang, learning from Kongjiang, and catching up with Kongjiang" is unfolding in other workers' new village stores in the city. (Attached picture)

    千方百计当好党组织人民经济生活的有力助手
    控江商店是居民的好管家
    本报讯　上海市控江商店认真贯彻“一切为工人新村居民生活服务”的方针，在当地党组织的领导下，充分发动和依靠商店内外群众，千方百计改进供应、服务工作，组织人民的经济生活，被誉为新村居民的“好管家”。
    控江商店是一家综合性的国营零售商店，担负着控江和附近的凤城、凤南等十四个工人新村，将近九万居民的生活用品供应和生活服务工作。商店经营的商品，从细小的发夹、别针到高档服装、整套家具，共有二万一千多种；同时设有食堂、小吃部、理发室、洗染组、照相馆、浴室和修配门市部等饮食、服务机构。居民需要的吃、穿、用商品和修、补、洗、染等服务项目，几乎样样俱全。这个九万人的“好管家”的特点是：熟知家底，心中有数，关心家人，体贴入微，商店因此成为新村居民经济生活的中心。
    控江商店在为工人新村居民生活服务和组织居民经济生活方面，采取了一系列的措施。
    摸清需要多方供应
    宣传政策指导消费
    为了管好这个“家”，职工们首先进行了细致的调查工作，研究消费规律，摸清“家”底。商店通过设立缺货登记簿，召开居民座谈会和上门访问等形式，经常征求消费者的意见和需要。周围十四个工人新村内，哪一行业的工人收入多少，哪一天发工资；村内有多少成年人，多少孩子，以及新村居民的人口变动和消费习惯，控江商店基本上都很清楚。商店根据这些情况，有目的地组织供应，及时改进服务工作。
    千方百计便利居民，像对待亲人一般关心、体贴居民，这是控江商店一个很大的特色。营业员走出柜台，主动为居民服务。谁家有了产妇或病人，他们及时把一些营养食品或药品送上门去。仅今年以来，商店为老、弱、病、残的居民和产妇送货上门就达一万六千多次。工人分三班生产，商店就日夜营业。夜班工人回家，午夜二三点钟还能在商店的小吃部吃到热点心。他们看到居民早晨买菜不便，就在菜场增人、增秤、增摊，并实行流动供应，满足了居民的需要。居民反映用具坏了没处修，商店便积极开办修配业务。设立了一个有七十多个修配项目的综合性修配门市部，从修理高档复杂的收音机、钟表、自行车到代磨菜刀，代穿牙刷等，应有尽有。为了给居民修理电灯泡断丝等毛病，营业员特地到南京去学习灯泡修理技术。修配门市部又在菜场摆摊和派人挑担背箱上门修理，便利群众。适应居民生活上多种多样的需要，控江商店还扩大代售报刊、邮票、公共车辆月季票等服务业务；开辟了一个拥有汽枪、拉力机等文娱用品的综合游艺室，深受居民欢迎。
    控江商店担负供应的地区，广达十五平方公里。为了尽量便利居民购买，商店在尽可能增加供应据点的同时，又走群众路线，依靠村内居民组织（即里弄委员会）开设了二十三家居民代销店，委托他们代销一部分居民日常生活必需的零星商品，弥补了商业网点的不足。现在控江商店共有各种供应据点六十七个，居民一般走三五分钟路就能买到东西。采取这一措施后，商业网的布局基本上做到了大、中、小类型相结合和集中、分散相结合；既有商品花色品种较多的大型商场；又有经营一般吃穿用商品，有一定数量花色品种，分布在一定地段的中型门市部；也有经营食品、杂货、小百货、油酱等生活必需品的分散的小型门市部和代销店，基本上适应了当前供应、服务工作的需要。
    控江商店不仅关心居民生活，周到地为居民服务，比较突出的是注意组织居民生活，指导消费。营业员们同居民交朋友，通过上门访问，互谈家常等方式，随时向群众开展经济宣传。去年夏天，草席供应一度不能满足需要，商店运用了供应商品和指导消费相结合的办法，召开居民座谈会，向大家讲解国家的商品供应政策，介绍货源情况，取得群众的支持与协助，由居民自己商议把草席供应给最急需的人；同时商店又大力开展旧席的修补工作。这样做法，居民普遍满意，有的还自动把买到的草席转让给急需者。控江商店营业员还经常钻研商品性能，向顾客传授保管知识，帮助精打细算，作他们的“参谋”。
    支持居民自我服务
    主动传授业务技术
    控江商店在改善本身供应和服务工作的同时，又在地区党政部门的领导下，支持与促进新村居民大办集体生活服务事业，通过群众自我服务的方式，满足生活中的一部分需要。这是控江商店组织新村居民经济生活的一项重要内容。在党的领导下，商店和新村居民组织共同组成了“组织人民经济生活管理委员会”，加强这方面工作的安排。到目前为止，他们已经帮助居民办起食堂、理发室、修配门市部等三十多个群众需要而又有条件兴办的集体生活服务组织；商店还不断地在业务技术、经营管理、原料设备供应等方面给以辅导和帮助，促使这些组织迅速巩固、发展。居民食堂成立初期，由于炊事员缺乏经验，伙食办得不够好。商店特地为食堂开办了炊事员训练班，派出优秀的厨师向他们传授调烹技术，协助安排菜单。在商店支持下，居民食堂的伙食质量大大提高，现在每天最少能供应十多种菜，多的时候有三十多种，搭伙的居民很快地增加。商店不但帮助居民组织培训理发员，开设了四家民办理发店，并主动训练了部分保育员为幼儿园的儿童理发。商店还帮助居民组织加工制造了五只热水炉，在控江、凤城等新村开设了五个群众迫切需要的民办热水店。商店的财务会计干部也经常到居民食堂、托儿所和其他民办服务组织去，帮助搞好财务管理工作。为了进一步满足群众生活上的各种需要，控江商店最近又协助新村居民组织在群众中开展“生活服务员”的试点工作，以房屋为单位，从居民中推选出一个“生活服务员”，帮助这幢屋内各户人家料理一部分家务，如打扫房间，代买东西、代收水电费，接送托儿所的孩子等。这一新的措施，不但大大便利居民，使更多的家庭妇女摆脱家务牵累参加生产，而且进一步促进了邻居之间互助友爱、团结和睦新风气的发扬。
    控江商店采取以上各种措施以后，商店和居民之间出现了亲如一家的新型关系。居民们都乐于帮助商店做好供应、服务工作。今年春节前，商店供应工作繁忙，人手不足，新村居民组织干部和部分居民自动到店帮助包扎年货，维持秩序。控江新村第二村有个退休老工人蒋荣法，近年来每天到商店的小吃部帮助做些轻便的杂务。他说：“工厂是国家的，商店也是国家的，我虽不在厂里生产，帮助商店做些轻便活也是应该的。”
    政治挂帅明确任务
    店内店外依靠群众
    控江商店在组织新村居民经济生活的工作中取得这些成就，首先是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅的结果。整风运动中，全体职工经过辩论，明确了商店的主要任务，就是为新村的工人及其家属服务，而这也就是为生产服务。以后，大家又一致认识到凡与居民生活密切有关的项目，只要有条件，都应该经营；只有这样，才能真正当好群众的“管家人”。在职工认识提高的基础上，控江商店采取了发动商店职工和紧紧依靠新村居民的方法，充分调动各方面的积极因素，使工作得以不断前进。控江商店的全部工作人员不到九百人，和新村九万居民是一与一百之比，商店被誉为“好管家”，关键之一就在于贯彻了党的群众路线。
    控江商店已经成为上海市工人新村商店中的一面旗帜。中共上海市委财贸部在最近召开的新工业区和工人新村地区商业工作会议上，着重介绍了这个商店的先进经验。现在，一个“比控江、学控江、赶控江”的竞赛，正在全市其他工人新村商店中展开。（附图片）
