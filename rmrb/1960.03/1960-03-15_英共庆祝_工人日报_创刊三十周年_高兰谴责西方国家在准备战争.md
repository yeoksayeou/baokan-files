Xinhua News Agency, London, March 13th: More than six thousand people in London's Royal Albert Hall enthusiastically celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the "Daily Worker" today. The conference chairman was George Matthews, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Worker." John Gollan, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, and the Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, spoke at the conference. The famous African-American singer Paul Robeson also attended the conference.

In his speech, John Gollan urged people from all walks of life across the country to make great efforts, regardless of political views, between now and the East-West summit to achieve the following demands: not a single German soldier on British soil, no Adenauer troops beyond West German borders, Britain must stop testing or manufacturing hydrogen bombs, drive out the American Yankees in Britain, and eliminate American missiles in Britain.

He said: "We are now facing the threat of German militarism for the third time in history." Of the seventeen members of Adenauer's cabinet, eight are Nazis. Two-thirds of his judges served under Hitler, as did all one hundred and four of his army generals and 85% of his diplomats.

"Who is responsible for this situation? The U.S. State Department and the Conservative government. They are handing guns to the Germans (West Germans), and they want to hand nuclear weapons to Adenauer. The (British) right-wing Labour leaders also bear a heavy responsibility because they supported the rearmament of Germany (West Germany) that began in 1954.

"In 1914, German troops could not set foot on British soil. In 1939, they only came to Britain as prisoners. But in 1960, the Conservative patriots are preparing to welcome them. And Gaitskell says he will also participate in the welcome."

He went on to point out that Britain's military expenditure will rise to £1.63 billion. Western countries are preparing for war, "because the idea of destroying the socialist world is still the basis of Western policy, the real reason for the establishment of NATO, the basis of nuclear strategy, and the reason for recreating the German military threat."

The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, congratulated the "Daily Worker," praising its leading role in the struggle for peace and socialism. He said, "In the world we live in, there is darkness on the side of capitalism. The prospect of undermining peace is becoming increasingly sinister." He mentioned the American attack on Cuba and Adenauer's arrogant desire to establish bases in Spain and Britain.

He also spoke of the achievements of socialist countries he had seen with his own eyes. He said, "China, Russia, and all socialist countries are booming. The unanimous call of socialist countries is for peace. Although they have far surpassed the Western world in mastering nuclear power, they are trying to use it for peace and to benefit mankind."

The chairman also read out congratulatory telegrams from the newspapers of other communist parties, including those of the Soviet Union, China, France, and the Netherlands.

    英共庆祝“工人日报”创刊三十周年
    高兰谴责西方国家在准备战争
    约翰逊教长赞扬社会主义国家的成就与和平政策
    据新华社伦敦13日电　今天有六千多人在伦敦皇家艾伯特大厅热烈庆祝“工人日报”创刊三十周年。大会主席是“工人日报”总编辑乔治·马修斯。英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰和坎特伯雷教长约翰逊在大会上讲了话。美国著名黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊也参加了大会。
    约翰·高兰在讲话中敦促全国各阶层人士从现在到举行东西方最高级会议期间不分一切政治见解地进行巨大努力，来争取实现以下要求：不让英国的土地上有一个德国兵，不让阿登纳的军队越出西德国境之外，英国必须停止试验或制造氢弹，赶走在英国的美国佬和取消在英国的美国导弹。
    他说：“我们现在是在历史上第三次面临着德国军国主义的威胁。“在阿登纳内阁的十七个成员中，有八个是纳粹分子。他的法官中有三分之二在希特勒手下当过差，他全部一百零四名陆军将领，他的外交人员的85％，都是这样。
    “谁应该对这种情况负责？是美国国务院和保守党政府。他们把枪炮交给德国（西德）人，而且他们要把核武器交给阿登纳。（英国）右翼工党领袖也负有重大责任，因为他们支持1954年开始的德国（西德）重新武装。
    “1914年，德国军队没有能踏上英国的土地。在1939年，他们只是作为俘虏到过英国。但是，在1960年，保守党的爱国者却准备欢迎他们。而盖次克尔还说，他也要参加欢迎。”
    他接着指出，英国的军费将上升到十六亿三千万英镑。西方国家正在准备战争，“因为摧毁社会主义世界的念头仍然是西方政策的基础，是成立北大西洋公约组织的真正原因，是核战略的基础，也是重新制造德国军事威胁的原因。”
    坎特伯雷教长约翰逊博士向“工人日报”祝贺，他赞扬“工人日报”在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中所起的领导作用。他说：“在我们生存的这个世界中，在资本主义这一边是黑暗的。破坏和平的景象日益凶险。”他提到了美国袭击古巴和阿登纳嚣张地要在西班牙和英国建立基地。
    他还谈到他亲眼看到的社会主义国家的成就。他说：“中国、俄国和所有社会主义国家都在蓬勃发展。社会主义国家一致的呼声是和平。虽然它们在掌握核力量方面已经远远超过西方世界，但是，它们设法把它用于和平和造福人类。”
    主席还宣读了其他国家的共产党机关报的贺电，包括苏联、中国、法国和荷兰共产党党报的贺电。
