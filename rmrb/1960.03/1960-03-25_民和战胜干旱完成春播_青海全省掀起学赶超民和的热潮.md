    Minhe Overcomes Drought, Completes Spring Planting
    Qinghai Province Launches a Surge to Learn From, Catch Up With, and Surpass Minhe
    (Our dispatch) Minhe County, Qinghai Province, relying on the great superiority of the people's communes, overcame the spring drought, launched a crash spring plowing effort, seized the soil moisture for early planting, and completed the early planting of 460,000 mu of spring wheat and highland barley half a month earlier than last year. Compared with last year, the planting time was advanced by one solar term, the planting process was shortened by fifteen days, and the planting quality was greatly improved.
    These early fields have sufficient base fertilizer, and were rolled and harrowed finely before and after planting. All seeds were carefully selected and disinfected, and strip planting with close spacing was implemented. The phenomenon of broken rows and missed planting was greatly reduced compared to previous years. Currently, some of these early-planted fields have already emerged. According to inspections, the emergence rate reached 97%, and the roots are deep and the seedlings are strong, enhancing drought resistance.
    Minhe County is located in an arid mountainous area, and spring droughts often threaten the planting of early-season crops. Last winter, there was only one snowfall, less than an inch deep. This year, the spring drought emerged earlier than in previous years and lasted longer. In response to this situation, the county party committee mobilized people of all ethnic groups to break with the past practice of not planting until the appointed time, based on comprehensively carrying out drought prevention and resistance, seizing soil moisture for early planting, and proactively attacking the drought. Because action was taken early and quickly, although the drought came early, spring planting was completed even earlier.
    Before spring plowing, the county party committee held five radio mobilization rallies, and each commune held mass oath-taking mobilization rallies and various forms of meetings for cadres and the masses, explaining the serious situation of the continuously developing drought and summarizing the experiences and benefits of timely early planting. This quickly turned the Party's call for drought prevention and resistance, crash spring plowing, and seizing soil moisture for early planting into the practical actions of the broad masses.
    Minhe County also transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen leadership on the front lines, solve problems in a timely manner when discovered, and promote experiences promptly. The county party committee held roving on-site meetings in the Manping and Guanting communes, where spring plowing and planting were fast and of high quality, and launched a competition throughout the county to learn from Manping, catch up with Guanting, and seize soil moisture for early planting. The county also continuously carried out high-efficiency movements centered on tool reform. Since last winter, various communes have built a large number of various transport vehicles and strip planting machines. At the beginning of spring planting, the communes further improved labor organization, established more than 4,000 specialized groups for crash spring planting, implemented a responsibility system of assigning people, land, livestock, time, quality, tools, and remuneration, and universally established inspection, acceptance, and quality registration systems. While inspecting and accepting, they also carried out replanting to eliminate third-class seedlings during the spring planting period.
    The victorious fact that Minhe County overcame the drought and completed the early planting of early-season crops ahead of schedule has greatly promoted the movement of crash spring plowing and seizing soil moisture for early planting in Qinghai Province. In the widespread surge of competition to "learn from Minhe, catch up with Minhe, and surpass Minhe," the progress of spring planting has greatly accelerated in various places. At present, the province has sown more than 4.14 million mu of early-season crops, accounting for more than 54% of the early-season planting plan, and it is expected to be basically completed before Qingming Festival, which is much earlier than in previous years.

    民和战胜干旱完成春播
    青海全省掀起学赶超民和的热潮
    本报讯　青海省民和县各族社员，依靠人民公社的巨大优越性，战胜春旱，突击春耕，抢墒早播，比去年提前半月完成了全县四十六万亩春小麦和青稞的早田播种任务。与去年比较，播种时间提前了一个节令，播种过程缩短了十五天，播种质量有很大提高。
    这些早田底肥充足，播前播后都经过镇压耱细，子种全部精选消毒，并实行了条播密植，断条漏播现象比往年大大减少。目前，这些早播种的田，部分已出苗。据检查，出苗率达到97％，而且扎根深，禾苗壮，增强了抗旱能力。
    民和县地处干旱山区，春旱经常威胁早田作物的播种。去冬只下过一次雪，深度不到一寸，今年，春旱露头比历年都早，持续期也比往年长。根据这一情况，县委动员各族社员，在全面开展防旱抗旱的基础上，打破以往不到时间不播种的常规，抢墒早播，主动向干旱进攻。由于动手早、行动快，虽然旱象来的早，但春播完成得更早。
    春耕前，县委召开了五次广播动员大会，各公社召开了万人宣誓动员大会和各种形式的干部、群众会，讲清旱象不断发展的严重情况，并总结了适时早播的经验和好处，使党的防旱抗旱，突击春耕，抢墒早播的号召，很快变成了广大群众的实际行动。
    民和县还调大批干部加强了第一线的领导，发现问题及时解决，总结经验及时推广。县委在春耕播种又快又好的满坪、官亭两个公社召开了巡回现场会议，在全县开展了学满坪、赶官亭的抢墒早播竞赛。全县还不断开展以工具改革为中心的高工效运动。去冬以来，各公社大量修造了各种运输车辆和条播机具。春播一开始，各公社又进一步改善劳动组织，建立了四千多个突击春播的专业小组，实现了定人、定地、定畜、定时、定质、定工具、定报酬的责任制度，普遍建立了检查验收和质量登记制度，一面检查验收，一面进行补种，把三类苗消灭在春播期间。
    民和县战胜干旱，提前完成早田作物春播的胜利事实，大大推动了青海省的突击春耕、抢墒早播运动，各地在广泛掀起的“学民和、赶民和、超民和”的竞赛热潮中，春播进度大大加快。目前全省已播早田作物四百一十四万多亩，占早田播种计划的54％以上，预计清明前可基本播完，比往年大大提前。（附图片）
