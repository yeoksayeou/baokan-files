Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 15th: The mass movement for eliminating pests and promoting hygiene in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, a town with a thousand-year history, has achieved outstanding results.

As soon as you arrive in this city, you immediately feel refreshed and comfortable. The streets and alleys are clean and beautiful, every household has bright windows and spotless floors, and everyone loves cleanliness and hygiene. Whether in the bustling main streets or remote alleys, it is difficult to see a puddle of sewage or a speck of phlegm. The dirtiest places in the past, such as Ju'an Lane, known as "Chicken Dung Alley," are now praised in poems: "Streets are like those after a rain, walls seem newly bathed, fragrance of flowers fills the lane, every household is spotlessly clean." It has become a "Hygiene Model Street." Twenty out of the twenty-three households on this street are "Hygiene Families." These "Hygiene Families" have truly achieved immaculate cleanliness inside and outside their homes. There are ninety-one such "Hygiene Model Streets" in the city, and more than six thousand seven hundred "Hygiene Families."

The sanitation work in the factories is also done very well. Although the factory buildings in many factories in Foshan are simple and the sanitary conditions are not good, they rely entirely on the workers themselves to keep the offices, workshops, kitchens, and even toilets clean at all times.

All restaurants in the city are generally equipped with fly-proof and dust-proof facilities. Large restaurants use steam disinfection cabinets to disinfect tableware, and communal chopsticks are provided for group meals. Even small establishments selling desserts, noodles, and herbal tea disinfect tableware by steaming and boiling. With the improvement of environmental hygiene and the cultivation of hygienic habits, the health level of the people of Foshan has been continuously improving. Last year, the incidence of malaria in the city decreased by 30% compared with 1958; the incidence of scrub typhus decreased from 0.13% to 0.08%.

Foshan has a very long history. Settlements were formed in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, more than 1,500 years ago. Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, handicrafts have flourished, and it has been known as one of the four major towns in the country along with Hankou, Jingdezhen, and Zhuxian Town. Before liberation, this ancient town had narrow streets and lanes, and most of the more than 1,300 streets had no sewage facilities. After heavy rain, the inner streets and alleys were often flooded. Even on sunny days, ditches and depressions were still full of sewage. After liberation, through a series of efforts, the city's appearance and environmental hygiene have gradually improved. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Foshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to lead the people of the city to thoroughly renovate the sewers with a revolutionary spirit, launch a mass movement, and fundamentally change the city's appearance.

For example, the project to eradicate the sewers, according to the original plan of the construction department, would take more than ten years and cost two million yuan to complete. However, as a result of the mass movement, it was completed in only sixty days at a cost of 150,000 yuan. At the beginning of the sewer construction project, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor personally took the lead and participated in voluntary labor. Eight hundred employees formed a professional team to build the sewers. All cadres of the municipal government regularly participated in voluntary labor, and the masses were mobilized to participate enthusiastically. In the process of construction, the Municipal Party Committee also adopted indigenous methods and economical methods to overcome various difficulties. When the cement used for construction was insufficient, they relied on their own efforts to establish a clinker-free cement plant to produce cement; when there were no technicians, they used the method of masters teaching apprentices to train them, and so on.

It is an important experience that Foshan's patriotic health movement can advance wave upon wave, consolidate step by step, and improve step by step, through the spirit of continuous revolution, according to the most urgent demands of the masses, seizing the key points of each period, putting forward clear slogans for action, and constantly guiding the masses forward.

Constantly paying attention to the various incorrect thoughts and slackening emotions of cadres and the masses in the movement, and resolutely overcoming them in their infancy, so that the masses always maintain a strong fighting spirit, is also an important experience in Foshan's mass health movement. In June last year, Foshan suffered from a severe flood, and the road surfaces and sewer manholes in some flooded areas were severely damaged. A large amount of sludge accumulated on the ground and walls, and many gardens and nurseries were destroyed. Some cadres and the masses once had negative and slack emotions. The Municipal Party Committee immediately held various meetings, boosted morale, and called on the people of the city to fight hard for forty days to improve sanitation, beautify the city, and welcome National Day. Forty days later, not only was the trace of the flood completely eliminated, but the city's appearance and sanitation were far better than before the disaster.

This year, the Municipal Party Committee has put forward slogans such as "Toilets without flies, maggots, and odor," "Thoroughly treat mosquito and fly breeding grounds," and "60% of the city's streets become hygiene model streets," mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and making the city's patriotic health movement more comprehensive and deeper. The rotten land in the back streets and alleys of Foshan in the past has now become gardens.

### 千年古镇喜新生　家家户户不染尘  佛山卫生工作十分出色　人民健康水平不断提高

    千年古镇喜新生　家家户户不染尘
    佛山卫生工作十分出色　人民健康水平不断提高
    据新华社广州15日电　千年古镇——广东省佛山市，群众性的除四害讲卫生运动成绩十分优异。
    一来到这个城市，人们立刻感到一身清爽舒适，只见大街小巷整洁美丽，家家户户窗明几净，人人都爱清洁、讲卫生。不论在繁华的大街，或偏僻的小巷，都很难看到一滩污水，一口痰涎。过去最脏的地方，例如居安里，被称为“鸡屎巷”，可是现在人们作诗歌咏它是：“街如雨后浇，墙似浴罢新，夹道花香袭，户户净无尘”，已经成为“卫生模范街”。住在这条街上的二十三户人家，就有二十户是“卫生之家”。这些“卫生之家”真是做到了室内室外纤尘不染。像居安里这样的“卫生模范街”，全市共有九十一条，“卫生之家”共有六千七百多户。
    工厂的卫生工作也做得很出色。佛山市许多工厂虽然厂房简陋，卫生条件并不好，但是全靠工人自己动手，不论是办公室、车间以至厨房、厕所，都能经常保持洁净。
    全市饮食店普遍设有防蝇、防尘设备。大的饮食店都用蒸气消毒柜来消毒食具，集体吃饭设公筷；小的如卖甜品、粉面，以至卖凉茶的，食具也用蒸煮的办法消毒。随着环境卫生的改善和卫生习惯的养成，佛山市人民的健康水平不断提高。去年，全市疟疾发病率比1958年下降了30％；恙虫病的发病率由0．13％下降到0．08％。
    佛山的历史，非常古老。东晋形成聚落，迄今已有一千五百多年。唐宋以来，手工业勃兴，与汉口、景德镇、朱仙镇并称为全国四大镇。这座古老的城镇，解放前街多巷窄，一千三百多条街道大都没有下水道设备，一下大雨，内街小巷常常受淹，即使到了晴天，阴沟洼地也还是到处积满污水。解放后，经过一系列的工作，市容和环境卫生面貌逐步有所改观。1958年大跃进中，中共佛山市委决心领导全市人民，以革命精神彻底整治下水道，大搞群众运动，从根本上改变了城市面貌。
    例如根治下水道的工程，按照原来建设部门的规划，要用十多年时间、两百万元经费才能完成。可是，大搞群众运动的结果，只用六十天、十五万元就完成了。修建下水道工程开始时，市委第一书记和市长亲自挂帅，带头参加义务劳动，八百名职工组成了修建下水道的专业队伍，全市机关干部都定期义务劳动，广大群众也动员起来热情地参加。在修建过程中，市委又采用土办法、穷办法来克服各种困难，建筑用的水泥不足，就自力更生建立无熟料水泥厂，生产水泥；没有技术人员，就用师傅带徒弟的办法培养等。
    用不断革命的精神，根据群众最迫切的要求，抓住每一时期的关键，提出明确的行动口号，不断引导群众前进，这是佛山市爱国卫生运动能够一浪高一浪，步步巩固、步步提高的重要经验。
    经常注意干部和群众在运动中的各种不正确思想和松劲情绪，坚决把它克服在萌芽的时候，使群众经常保持旺盛的斗志，也是佛山市大搞群众性卫生运动的重要经验。去年6月，佛山市曾遭受到特大洪水的侵袭，一部分受淹地区的路面和下水道沙井都受到严重破坏，地面和墙壁积存了大量污泥，许多花园、花圃被摧残，有些干部和群众为此一度产生了消极松劲情绪。市委马上召开各种会议，大鼓干劲，号召全市人民大战四十天，搞好卫生，美化市容，迎接国庆。四十天后，不仅完全消灭了洪水侵袭的痕迹，而且市容和卫生面貌远胜灾前。
    今年，市委又提出了“厕所无蝇、无蛆、无臭”、“彻底处理蚊蝇孳生地”、“全市60％街道成为卫生模范街”等口号，调动群众积极性，使全市爱国卫生运动更全面、更深入地向前发展。过去佛山市横街小巷里的烂地，如今变成了花园。
