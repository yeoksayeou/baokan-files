	Silkworm Raising Has Its Tricks
	Warm-breeding, Semi-Mechanized Slope Preparation
	In order to accelerate the pace of building socialism in mountainous areas, the Wawu Brigade of the Wawu Commune in Lushan County, Henan, is expanding its silkworm production this year by another 450 trays compared to last year. How to accomplish this task? The only way is to innovate silkworm raising techniques and implement mechanized silkworm farming.

	In order to realize this ambitious goal, the Party branch decided to ask the staff of the silkworm seed farm to help complete this task, creating a model of technological innovation for everyone to learn from. Under the guidance and assistance of Comrade Li Zhongkui, secretary of the commune Party committee, and Comrade Zhu Changfa, a cadre from the county agriculture bureau, the staff of the silkworm seed farm quickly designed two types of warm-breeding machinery: the "overhead rail hanging seed machine" and the "underground rail hanging seed machine."

	After these two hanging seed machines were manufactured and put into practical use, they fully met the original design requirements. The entire brigade only needed 16 people to manage 500,000 silkworm cocoons, which would have required 50 people using traditional methods. This new development quickly shocked silkworm farmers in all 24 brigades of the commune, and many brigades sent people to visit and learn from their experience. Seven brigades, including Liu Xianggongzhuang, learned from this experience and quickly built 24 hanging seed machines. The brigade Party branch further proposed to realize the mechanization of oak forest slope preparation and the cable transportation of silkworms this year, so that the entire silkworm farming enterprise can be fully mechanized. They plan to build 40 slope preparation machines before the silkworms are moved onto the slopes. Each slope preparation machine requires one person to operate and can prepare one tray's worth of oak trees in half a day, increasing efficiency tenfold compared to using a sickle in the past. At the same time, they will install 50 silkworm transportation cableways, each requiring only two people to operate, and the work they do in four hours would take two people two days to complete. After adopting this tool, the traditional method of carrying silkworms in baskets on their heads, which has been passed down for thousands of years, will no longer be seen.

### 暖种、整坡半机械化

    种桑养蚕有窍门
    暖种、整坡半机械化
    河南鲁山县瓦屋公社瓦屋大队为了加快山区建设社会主义的步子，今年的蚕业生产比去年又扩大了四百五十个筐。怎样来完成这个任务呢？唯一的办法是：革新养蚕技术，实现养蚕用机械操作。
    为了实现这个雄心壮志，党支部研究决定，要求蚕种场的职工协助完成这一任务，做出技术革新的样子让大家学习。蚕种场职工在公社党委李中魁书记和县农业局干部朱长发等同志指导和协助下，很快设计出“空中吊轨挂种机”和“地下轨道挂种机”两种暖种机械。
    这两种挂种机械制成后，经过实用，完全合乎原设计作用。全队只用十六人，就代替用笨办法五十人才能管理的五十万粒茧种。这件新事，很快震动了全公社二十四个大队的蚕农，不少大队都派人前往参观取经。刘相公庄等七个大队学习了这一经验，很快就造出挂种机二十四部。大队党支部又进一步提出今年要实现整理柞林坡机械化，运蚕索道化，使整个养蚕事业全面实现机械化。他们准备在蚕上坡以前，要造出整坡机四十部。整坡机每部一人操作，半天就可以整出一个筐的栎柞，比过去用镰刀整坡效率提高十倍。同时，还要安装运蚕索道五十道，每道索道只二人操作，每四个小时干的活就得两个人干两天。采用这种工具以后，几千年来遗留下的用头顶筐运蚕的笨办法就再也看不见了。
