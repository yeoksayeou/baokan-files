According to the Soviet newspaper "Literature and Life": The "White Villa" State Farm near Moscow, under the guidance of the Vegetable Cultivation Science Research Institute, is conducting an experiment on a novel method of crop cultivation—growing crops without soil.

	In a greenhouse at this farm, there are many boxes placed on shelves. Cucumber vines and tomato seedlings bearing abundant fruits extend from the lids of the boxes. However, there is no soil in the boxes. The roots of these plants pass through small holes in the box lids and extend into the boxes. Hanging below the box lids are some small plastic mesh bags, and the roots extend into these bags. At the same time, some atomizers are installed in the boxes. Under the action of an automatic timer, the atomizers spray nutrient solution onto the roots every thirty seconds to ensure the plants' growth needs. "Literature and Life" points out that this method can obtain very high yields, and because it eliminates the need to frequently replace the soil in the greenhouse, irrigate, and fertilize the plants, it can greatly reduce labor consumption.

    苏一农场试验不用土壤种蔬菜
    据苏联“文学与生活”报报道：莫斯科近郊的“白色别墅”国营农场在蔬菜种植科学研究所指导下，进行了一种新奇的农作物栽培方法的试验——不要土壤种庄稼。
    在这个农场一个暖房的架子上，放着许多箱子。箱盖上伸出结了累累瓜果的黄瓜蔓和蕃茄秧。但是箱子里并没有泥土。这些植物的根穿过箱盖的小孔，伸入箱里。箱盖下面悬着一些很小的塑料网袋，根就伸在这些袋中。同时在箱子里装有一些喷雾器。喷雾器在自动替续器作用下，每隔三十秒钟就向根部喷射一次营养液，来保证植物生长的需要。“文学与生活”报指出，用这种方法可以获得很高的产量，而且由于不再需要经常更换暖房的土壤、进行灌溉和给植物追肥，可以大大减少劳动消耗。
