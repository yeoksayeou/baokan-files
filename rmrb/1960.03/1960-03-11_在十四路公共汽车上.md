    On the No. 14 Bus
    Shěn Lízhū
    One afternoon, a young woman came into the maternity ward of the Beijing Ping'an Hospital. When she said who she was there to visit, one of the new mothers asked in surprise, "Looking for me?" "Yes, I was worried, so I came to see you." "But... I don't recognize you." "You gave birth on our bus that day..." "Ah! It's you! Thank you so much, I don't know what I would have done without you!"...
    This young woman is Zhang Xiulan, a conductor on the No. 14 bus. That day, she was on duty on the bus. As usual, after selling tickets, she stood by the bus door carefully observing the passengers in the carriage, seeing who needed help. Suddenly, she noticed a woman standing and leaning against the railing behind the driver's seat. When she walked closer, she realized it was a pregnant woman. She anxiously said, "Quick, sit down!" But the pregnant woman shook her head painfully, beads of sweat the size of soybeans on her forehead, and whispered, "I can't, I didn't expect it to happen so quickly." After Zhang Xiulan discussed it with the driver, she said to the passengers, "A comrade needs to get to the hospital immediately, please change to another bus." After the passengers got off the bus, Zhang Xiulan hurriedly took off her coat and put it on the pregnant woman, and together with another conductor, supported her. The pregnant woman said she was going to the staff hospital outside Deshengmen. Zhang Xiulan calculated that it would take another half an hour to get to that hospital, so she discussed it with the driver and took the pregnant woman to the nearby Ping'an Hospital. Not long after the bus entered the hospital gate, the cry of a baby could be heard.
    Such considerate care for passengers is not uncommon on the No. 14 bus. In the past year alone, they have received more than 450 letters of commendation. If you ride the No. 14 bus, you will see the conductors greeting passengers with a smile along the way: "Old lady, be careful, let me help you off the bus." "Comrades, be careful after you get off the bus, the road ahead is narrow and crowded..." When they see a sick person getting on, they immediately say, "Would someone please give this patient a seat." When they see someone dozing off, they go over and say, "Comrade, please tell me where you are getting off, I'll call you when we're almost there, so you don't get off right after waking up and catch a cold!"
    One day, when the bus arrived at Liuhai Hutong Station, a rural woman came on board with two children. The conductor Jiao Yongfang helped her carry the children onto the bus and found her a seat. But after a while, the conductor noticed that the woman's seat was drafty, so she discussed it with other passengers and changed her to a seat that wasn't drafty. Then she noticed that the woman's children's little hands were frozen red, so she took off her coat and put it on the children.
    There are forty-six conductors on the No. 14 bus, 90% of whom are women, and the vast majority are housewives who newly joined the workforce in 1958. When they first started working, they hoped to earn some wages to solve their family's financial problems. When they heard passengers shouting "Ticket seller!", they would get angry.
    After the Party organization learned about this situation, they explained the revolutionary heroic deeds of Liu Hulan and Xiang Xiuli to everyone, and launched a discussion: "Who are we working for?"
    Jiao Yongfang said, "Before, I felt that being a conductor was demeaning, but when some conductors did good deeds, the masses wrote letters of commendation, and some even gloriously participated in the National Congress of Advanced Producers. Passengers also respected us very much, and some even actively helped us with our work. One day, it was barely light, and a large group of passengers crowded onto the bus at the northern suburbs. One person stood out and maintained order at the bus door. Later, on the bus, he kept shouting, "Comrades who just got on, please move forward...". Once, twice, for a month, two months, this person always helped us with our work so conscientiously. Who was he? Later, we found out that he was the director of the factory director's office at the Broadcasting Equipment Factory. If people think our work is glorious, how can we think it is demeaning?"
    Zhang Xiulan said, "My home is in Hufangqiao. Before, there were only some crooked and dilapidated small houses there, but now building after building has been erected. Every day when I sell tickets on the bus, I think: if our buses didn't deliver workers, cadres, and students to construction sites, offices, and schools on time, the houses certainly couldn't be built so quickly. The construction of the motherland also has a contribution from us conductors."
    After the discussion meeting, the Party branch organized everyone to study from the No. 13 bus. As soon as you got on their bus, the atmosphere was different. Their conductors were constantly calling out "Uncle, Auntie" along the way. Taking care of passengers was truly meticulous! If they saw you wanted to vomit, they would immediately hand you a water bottle. If they saw a patient was cold, they would immediately take off their own clothes and put them on the patient.
    Having established the viewpoint of serving the people, it is also necessary to have the ability to serve. The conductors worked hard and diligently, using their spare time to walk through all the stations on the entire line, striving to be the passengers' "living map". As they walked, they wrote down the names and street numbers of all the hutongs, factories, offices, and schools near each station. In order to understand the situation near a small section of the line, Zhang Xiulan spent almost three and a half days of her time off. At that time, Zhang Xiulan worked the night shift, and didn't get off work until twelve o'clock every night, but the next morning she would get up at four o'clock, braving the severe winter cold to familiarize herself with the route's geographical environment. One day, it was the Communist Youth League member Yang Shuangqiao's day off, but she got up even earlier than usual. She took dry rations and walked south along the line from the northern starting station, and didn't return to the dormitory until dark. Now, the vast majority of conductors on this line can say the names and directions, and even the street numbers, of 294 hutongs and 254 offices, schools, factories, and other units near the line. Many conductors also worked hard to correct their shortcomings and facial expressions. For example, Jiao Yongfang is from Shandong, so she learned from comrades who spoke Beijing dialect well, and now it is difficult for people to hear her Shandong accent. Li Shuqin, who had a habit of frowning since she was a child, practiced smiling in the mirror whenever she had time. Many people even recited conductor phrases in their dreams.
    One night, the last No. 14 bus arrived at Deshengmen Station. A young man helped an old woman onto the bus. The young man said to the conductor, "Please take care of this old woman, she's going to Madian." "To get to Madian, you need to change to the No. 44 bus. The last No. 44 bus has already left. I think it's better to let the old woman go home and rest for the night, and go tomorrow!" The young man said embarrassedly, "Yes! But I'm also just passing by, I just met this old woman." The conductor, who had always thought they were mother and son, said in surprise, "Oh, really? Then thank you, let me help the old woman onto the bus!" After getting on the bus, the conductor thought: From the No. 14 terminal station to Madian there is still one stop (equivalent to two stops in the city), who can send this seemingly weak old woman? While selling tickets, she asked the old woman where she was going in Madian. The conductor asked all the passengers on the bus, "Is anyone going to Xiaoguanxi Houjie in Madian? Please help send this old woman home." "I'm going to Madian, but I'm not going to the place you mentioned, but I can send her home," a young man replied. The conductor smiled and thanked the young man. After a while, the conductor thought again, the old woman has so much difficulty walking, it's probably not enough for just one person to take care of her, so she asked the newly arrived passengers again if anyone was going to Madian, and immediately another young man volunteered to go. Unexpectedly, the two passengers walked back after supporting the old woman for a while. It turned out that it was too dark, and the old woman was in poor health, so it was difficult to walk. The two passengers discussed with the conductor whether the bus could take the old woman to Madian? They would pay for the gasoline. After the conductor discussed it with the driver, they decided to take them there by bus, and said, "We are entrusting you to take care of the passenger, how can we ask you to pay for the gasoline?" After the bus arrived in Madian, there was no road, so they could only walk. The conductor instructed the two to be sure to take the old woman home.

    在十四路公共汽车上
    沈骊珠
    一天下午，北京市平安医院的产妇病房里，进来一位年青姑娘，当她说出是来探望谁的时候，一位产妇惊讶地问：“找我？”“是啊，我不放心，看你来了。”“我怎么……不认识你。”“那天你在我们公共汽车上生孩子……”“啊！是你呀，多亏了你，不然真不知会闹成什么样子！”……
    这位年青姑娘是十四路公共汽车上的售票员张秀兰。那天，她在车上值班。像往常一样，卖完车票，她就站在车门前细心地观察车厢内乘客的情况，看谁需要照顾。突然她发现一位女同志靠在司机座后的栏杆上站着，走到跟前仔细一看原来是个孕妇，她着急地说：“快坐下吧！”可是孕妇痛苦地摇摇头，额上流着黄豆大的汗珠，低声地说：“不行了，没有想到这么快就要生产。”张秀兰和司机商量后就对乘客们说：“有一位同志需要马上进医院，麻烦大家换个车。”乘客们下车后，张秀兰忙把自己衣服脱下来盖在孕妇身上，并和另一位乘务员一起扶住孕妇。孕妇说她到德胜门外的职工医院，张秀兰算了算，到那个医院还要走半个多钟头，于是她和司机商量，把孕妇送到附近的平安医院。车进医院大门不一会儿，就传出了婴儿的哭声。
    像这样细心照顾乘客的事，在十四路公共汽车上并不是个别的。一年来光表扬信她们就收到四百五十多封。假如你坐十四路车，你就会看见售票员一路上笑着招呼乘客：“老大妈，小心点，我扶你下车。”“同志们下车后要小心，前面路窄人多……”看见有病人上来，他们马上说：“请哪位同志给这位病人让个座。”见有人打瞌睡了，他们就走过去说：“同志，请你告诉我，你在哪里下车，等会快到站时我喊你，免得你刚醒来就下车，吹了风着凉！”
    有一天，车到刘海胡同站，上来一位农村妇女，带着两个孩子。售票员焦永芳帮助她把孩子抱上车，还给她找到了座位。但是过了一会，售票员就发现这个妇女的座位有风，于是就和别的乘客商量，给她换了个没风的位置。接着她又发现这个妇女的孩子的小手冻得腓红，她就脱下外衣给孩子盖在身上。
    十四路公共汽车上有四十六位售票员，90％是妇女，而且绝大多数是1958年新参加工作的家庭妇女。她们刚参加工作时，是抱着拿些工资解决家庭经济问题的。她们听见乘客喊“卖票的”，火就来了。
    党组织知道这种情况后，就给大伙讲解刘胡兰、向秀丽的革命英雄事迹，并发动大家鸣放辩论：“为谁劳动？”
    焦永芳说：“早先我觉得售票员是低三下四的，可是有些售票员做了点好事群众就来信表扬，有的人还光荣地参加了全国先进生产者代表大会。乘客们也很尊重我们，有人甚至还主动地帮助我们工作。有一天，天刚麻麻亮，车到北郊，一大群乘客挤着上车，有一个人站出来，在车门口维持秩序。后来到车上他也一路上喊着：“刚上来的同志，请往前走……”。一次，两次，一月，两月，这个人总是这样认真地帮助我们工作。他是个什么人？后来一打听，原来是广播器材厂厂长办公室的主任。人家觉得咱们的工作很光荣，咱怎么能觉得下贱？”
    张秀兰说：“我家住在虎坊桥，以前那里只有一些歪歪斜斜的小破房，现在一幢幢的楼房盖起来了。每天我在车上卖票时，心里想：要不是我们公共汽车按时把工人、干部、学生送到工地、机关、学校，房子一定不能盖得这样快，祖国的建设也有售票员的一份功劳。
    辩论会开过后，党支部又组织大伙去十三路公共汽车学习。一上人家的车，气氛就不同，人家售票员在路上大爷大娘喊个不停。照顾乘客可真是体贴入微啦！见你想吐，马上把水壶递过去，见病人冷，立刻把自己的衣服脱下来披在病人身上。
    树立了为人民服务的观点，还要有服务的本领。售票员们勤学苦练，利用业余时间，步行走遍了全线各站，争做乘客的“活地图”。他们一边走一边把各站附近的胡同和工厂、机关、学校的名称、门牌号码统统记下来。为了了解一小段线路附近的情况，张秀兰花了差不多三个半天的休息时间。那时候，张秀兰上晚班，天天晚上十二点才下班，可是第二天清早四点多钟她就起来，冒着深冬严寒去熟悉线路地理环境。有一天轮到共青团员杨双巧休息，但她比平时起得更早。她带着干粮从城北起点站沿线往南步行，一直到天黑才回宿舍。现在这条线路的绝大部分售票员都能说出线路附近二百九十四条胡同和二百五十四个机关、学校、工厂等单位的名称、方向，甚至门牌号码。许多售票员还下功夫改正自己的缺点和面部表情。如焦永芳是山东人，她就向北京话讲得好的同志学习，现在人们很难听出她的山东口音了。从小好皱眉头的李淑琴，一有空就对着镜子练习微笑。很多人作梦还在背售票员的用语。
    那是一个夜晚，十四路末班车开到德胜门站，有一位年青人扶着一位老太太上车，年青人对售票员说：“请您照顾一下老太太，她到马甸。”“到马甸要换四十四路车，四十四路末班车早过去了，我看还是让老太太回家歇一夜，明天再走吧！”那个年青人为难地说：“是啊！不过我也是过路人，刚刚才遇见这位老太太。”一直以为他们是一对母子的售票员惊奇地说：“原来这样，那谢谢你，让我扶老太太上车吧！”上车后，售票员心想：从十四路终点站到马甸还有一站路（相当于市内二站路），谁能送这个看来身体很弱的老太太呢？她一边卖票一边问老人到马甸什么地方？售票员向全车乘客打听：“哪位同志到马甸小官西后街，劳驾帮忙送这位老太太回家。”“我上马甸，不过我不上你说的那个地方去，但是我可以送她回家。”一位年青人回答说。售票员笑着向年青人道了谢。过了一会，售票员又想，老太太走路那么困难，光一个人照顾恐怕还不行，于是再次向新上车的人打听谁去马甸，马上又有一个青年人自报奋勇愿去。没想到两位乘客扶着老人走了一段路又折回来，原来天太黑，加上老太太身体不好，走起来很吃力。这两位乘客和售票员商量，能不能用车子把老太太送到马甸？汽油费由他们出。售票员和司机商量后决定用车子把他们送去，并说：“我们托你们照顾乘客，哪能叫你们出汽油费？”车到马甸后，没公路了，只能步行，售票员嘱咐两人一定要把老太太送到家。
