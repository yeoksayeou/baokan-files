    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26th. Guangdong's spring plowing production this year is early, fast, plentiful, and good. As of March 20th, the province had transplanted half of the planned area for early rice. Currently, the entire province is concentrating more than 70% of its labor force on rushing to transplant, with the transplanting progress reaching more than one million mu per day.

    Early is a revolutionary measure taken by various parts of Guangdong to strive for continued leaps forward in agricultural production this year. In order to be early, Guangdong farmers launched a massive farmland capital construction movement as soon as the autumn harvest ended last year. Whether it was water conservancy construction, deep plowing and soil improvement, or manure accumulation, they completed the original plan one to two months earlier than last year and exceeded the target. Therefore, this year, whether it is sowing, delivering fertilizer, preparing fields, or transplanting, it is all more than half a month earlier than last year.

    Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture with higher standards, and transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields and making high-yield fields even higher-yields, is a mass high-yield movement unprecedented in scale. This is another feature of Guangdong's spring plowing this year. The Shantou Special District, which first initiated the "Thousand Jin Rice, Ten Thousand Jin Sweet Potatoes" movement last year, has determined more than two million mu of high-yield fields, accounting for nearly half of the total early rice area, and there are about two million cadres and people engaged in managing high-yield fields. Xinhui County has established high-yield headquarters from the county party committee to the production brigade, headed by the agricultural secretary; and it was decided that the county party committee, commune, and brigade would each establish a 10,000 mu, 1,000 mu, and 100 mu high-yield demonstration area, respectively, to guide the high-yield movement. In addition, advanced cultivation techniques centered on rational close planting have been mastered by the majority of farmers and have entered a new stage of popularization throughout the province, so the quality of transplanting is particularly good this year.

    The policy of taking grain as the key link for overall leap forward and diversifying high-yield and high-harvest has also been better implemented in this year's spring plowing. This year, the province plans to expand the early rice planting area to more than 32 million mu, an increase of 6 million mu over last year. While expanding the area of early rice, in addition to the more than 22 million mu of spring-harvested crops such as sweet potatoes, wheat, green manure, and fodder that were planted last winter, this spring the province has also reclaimed more than 9.8 million mu of wasteland, an average increase of 0.3 mu of cultivated land per agricultural person. Sugarcane, peanuts, vegetables, and nearly one million mu of various fruit trees have now been planted, all planted better and more than last year.

    The biggest feature of Guangdong's spring plowing production this year is that the cadres' command is firm and the masses' understanding is consistent. Therefore, from preparation for plowing to transplanting, the entire production movement is closely linked, with wave after wave higher than the last, both a scene of ten thousand horses galloping and with rhythmic ups and downs.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 26th. Spring sowing work in Zhejiang Province has been fully launched. As of March 20th, the province had sown 750,000 mu of early rice seedling fields, and the first batch of seeds sown has taken root and turned green.

    The sowing quality in Zhejiang Province this year is better than in previous years, and the sowing time is generally five to seven days earlier than in previous years. More than 90% of the early rice sown has been treated with wind selection, screening, salt water selection, or chemical disinfection. The seedling fields are flat, soft, and moderately dry, and the base fertilizer is also applied sufficiently and the sowing is even.

    The early rice area in Zhejiang Province this year will be expanded by more than 2.6 million mu compared to last year. In order to complete the sowing plan in a timely manner, various places have carried out technological innovation and technological revolution in plowing and sowing tools during spring sowing, and have manufactured and promoted a large number of new deep plowing and sowing tools. People's communes in various parts of the Ningbo Special District have created new tools such as three-wet harrows, ash spreading carts, seedling mud boards, and seeders. After manufacturing and promoting a large number of deep plowing plows, seeders, and seedling field flattening machines, the Qiantan People's Commune in Jiande County has achieved high efficiency and high quality sowing. The popularization of steam seedling raising in Pinghu, Tongxiang, Deqing and other counties in the Jiaxing Special District has reduced the use of seedling fields and solved the contradiction of insufficient labor. The experience of direct sowing and seedling separation vigorously promoted in Ningbo Special District not only reduced the area of seedling fields, but also can increase the yield per unit area.

    On the basis of improving sowing quality, all localities have strengthened seedling field management in a timely manner. Many commune members in the Ningbo Special District, under the slogan of "People do not leave the fields, sleep with the seedlings, not a single plant rots, every plant is strong," have camped in the fields and carefully managed the seedlings. 80% of the production teams in the Wenzhou Special District have established a seedling field management responsibility system. The 15,000 production teams in the Jiaxing Special District have also selected a large number of party members, League members, and outstanding commune members to specifically manage the seedling fields. The cadres of each commune in Shangyu County have also established seedling raising command fields, summarizing and disseminating the experience of cultivating strong seedlings in a timely manner.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 26th. The vast number of commune members in Jiangxi are fighting in the fields during the day and sleeping with the rice at night, launching an intense battle to protect seeds and seedlings.

    Of the 2.6 million mu of early rice seedling fields in Jiangxi Province, 70% have already been sown and sprouted, and the seedlings exposed above the water surface are generally three to four inches high; the remaining 30% are being soaked or have just been sown. However, since mid-March, due to the invasion of cold air, continuous rain, and temperatures dropping below ten degrees, the growth of seedlings and the germination of seeds have been seriously threatened. In order to prevent seed rotting and seedling rotting, and to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, party committees at all levels throughout the province have taken emergency measures to establish seedling raising and seedling protection command organizations from the county to the commune to the team, with the party committee secretary personally taking charge, leading and organizing commune members to invest in the seedling protection battle, trying every possible means to protect the seedlings to safely survive the cold air and rainy season.

    In the emergency large-scale seed protection and seedling protection battle, people's communes in various localities uniformly dispatched and arranged manpower and materials, and quickly formed a large number of professional teams and combat groups to fight day and night in the fields, carrying out shock resistance to cold and seed and seedling protection. On the day the cold air arrived, the communes in the Jiujiang Special District organized more than 15,700 seedling protection professional teams and combat groups, and 46,000 commune members rushed to cover 7,100 wind and rain protection seedling sheds for seedling fields overnight with door panels, straw mats, etc. At the same time, various communes also concentrated a large amount of firewood, thatch, and sod, burning fires and smoking on the edge of the fields to ensure the temperature of the seedling fields. In the seedling protection battle, there was also extensive cooperation in manpower and materials between communes in various places.

    Now the work of resisting cold and protecting seedlings is still being strengthened step by step. The seedling protection fighters in various places have put forward the slogan "Protect the seedlings to the end, and do not withdraw troops until we win against the weather," not leaving the fields and sleeping with the rice at night. Under the careful care of the people, the seedlings that have been sown in various places are growing against the cold, and a scene of lush green that was not seen in disaster seasons in previous years has appeared in the fields.

    时间提早  质量提高  面积扩大
    广东进入插秧大忙季节
    浙江精心育秧苗七十五万亩江西全面展开防寒护秧斗争
    本报广州26日电　广东今年春耕生产早、快、多、好。到3月20日为止，全省栽插的早稻已占计划面积一半。目前，全省集中70％以上的劳力进行抢栽抢插，插秧进度每天达到一百多万亩。
    早，是广东各地争取今年农业生产继续跃进的一项革命性措施。为了早，广东农民在去年秋收一结束，便开展规模浩大的农田基本建设运动，不论是水利建设、深耕改土或积肥，都比去年提前一两个月超额完成了原定计划。因此，今年无论播种、送肥、办田、插秧，都比去年提早半个月以上。
    以更高的标准贯彻农业“八字宪法”，要低产田变高产、高产田更高产的群众性高产运动，规模之大，前所未有。这是广东今年春耕的另一个特点。去年首倡“千斤稻万斤薯”运动的汕头专区，确定了高产田二百多万亩，占早稻总面积近一半，经营高产田的干部和群众约有二百万人。新会县从县委到生产大队都成立了高产指挥部，由农业书记挂帅；并决定县委、公社、大队分别各搞一万亩、一千亩、一百亩高产示范区，指导高产运动。此外，以合理密植为中心的先进栽培技术已为广大农民所掌握，进入了在全省范围普及的新阶段，因此今年插秧质量特别好。
    以粮为纲全面跃进和多种高产多收的方针，今年春耕中也贯彻得更好。今年全省计划种植早稻面积扩大到三千二百多万亩，比去年增加六百万亩。在扩大早稻面积的同时，除了去冬种下二千二百多万亩番薯、小麦、绿肥、饲料等春收作物外，今春全省又开垦荒地九百八十多万亩，按农业人口平均，每人增加了三分耕地。现在已种了甘蔗、花生、蔬菜和近百万亩各类果树，都比去年种得多种得好。
    广东今年春耕生产最大的特点是干部指挥坚定，群众认识一致，因而由备耕到插秧，整个生产运动环环紧扣，浪浪比高，既是万马奔腾，又有节奏起伏。
    本报杭州26日电　浙江省春播工作已全面展开。到3月20日止，全省已播种早稻秧田七十五万亩，第一批播的种子已扎根转青。
    浙江省今年的播种质量比往年更好，播种时间普遍比往年提早五天到七天。已播的早稻，90％以上的种子都经过风选、筛选、盐水选或药剂消毒处理。秧田做得平整，干软适度，基肥也施得足，播种均匀。
    浙江省今年早稻面积将比去年扩大二百六十多万亩。为了适时完成播种计划，各地在春播中都开展了耕播工具的技术革新和技术革命，制造和推广了大批深耕播种新工具。宁波专区各地人民公社创造了三湿耙、施灰车、秧坭板、播种器等新工具。建德县乾潭人民公社在制造和推广了大批深耕犁、播种器、秧田平板器后，实现了播种高工效、高质量。嘉兴专区平湖、桐乡、德清等县普遍推广蒸汽育秧，减少了秧田用地和解决了劳力不足的矛盾。宁波专区大力推广的直播分苗经验，不仅减少了秧田面积，而且还能够提高单位面积产量。
    各地在提高播种质量的基础上，都及时加强秧田管理工作。宁波专区的许多社员在“人不离田，与秧共眠，一株不烂，株株健壮”的口号下，都到田头扎营，精心管理秧苗。温州专区有80％的生产队已建立了秧田管理责任制。嘉兴专区的一万五千个生产队还挑选了大批党团员和优秀社员专管秧田。上虞县各公社的干部还都建立了育秧指挥田，及时总结和传播培育壮秧的经验。
    本报南昌26日电　江西各地广大社员日战田间、夜伴禾眠，展开紧张的护种护秧战斗。
    江西省二百六十万亩早稻秧田，70％已经播种出苗，秧苗露出水面一般有三、四寸高；其余30％左右正在浸种或刚刚播种。但从3月中旬开始，由于寒潮侵袭，各地连绵阴雨，气温降到十度以下，严重威胁着秧苗生长和种谷出芽。为了防止烂种烂秧，确保早稻丰收，全省各级党委都采取紧急措施，从县到社、到队层层建立起育秧护秧指挥机构，由党委书记亲自挂帅，领导和组织社员投入护秧战斗，千方百计保护秧苗安全度过寒潮、雨季。
    在紧急的大规模的护种护秧战斗中，各地人民公社统一调度安排人力、物力，迅即组成大批专业队、战斗组日夜轮战田间，突击抗寒护种护秧。九江专区在寒潮到来当天，各公社即组织起一万五千七百多个护秧专业队、战斗组，四万六千多名社员连夜用门板、草垫等为秧田抢盖了七千一百个防风、防雨的护秧棚。同时，各公社还集中大量柴禾、茅草、草皮，在田头田边烧火熏烟，保证了秧田温度。在护秧战斗中，各地社与社之间还广泛开展了人力、物力的大协作。
    现在抗寒护秧工作还在步步加强，各地护秧战斗员提出“保秧保到底，不胜天时不收兵”的口号，人不离田，夜与禾眠。在人们的精心护理下，各地已播种下的秧苗正斗寒生长，田野里出现了一片往年灾害季节所没有的盛绿景象。（附图片）
