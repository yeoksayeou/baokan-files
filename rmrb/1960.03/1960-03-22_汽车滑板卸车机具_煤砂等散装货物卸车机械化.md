    Automobile Skid Unloading Machine
    Mechanizing Unloading of Bulk Cargoes like Coal and Sand
    Zong Chengmo, a stevedore at the Dalian Crane Machinery Factory, recently successfully created an automobile skid unloading machine, which has mechanized the unloading of bulk cargo such as coal, sand, and stone, increasing efficiency tenfold compared to manual unloading.
    The automobile skid unloading machine created by Zong Chengmo has a simple structure. It uses six channel steels, with two combined together, and iron balls placed in the middle to form three chutes placed on the bottom of the truck bed. Then, skids are installed on top of the chutes. When loading, bulk cargo is placed on the skids; when unloading, the rear wall of the truck bed is opened, and the truck moves forward slightly. The iron balls inside the chutes rotate, and the entire truckload of goods quickly slides down.

    汽车滑板卸车机具
    煤砂等散装货物卸车机械化
    大连起重机器厂搬运工人宗成谟最近创造成功汽车滑板卸车机具，使煤、砂、石等散装货物的卸车操作实现了机械化，比人工卸车提高效率十倍。
    宗成谟创造的汽车滑板卸车机具结构简单，即用六根槽铁，每两根合在一起，中间放上圆铁球，组成三个滑道放在车厢底板上。然后，在滑道上边装上滑板。装车时，将散装的货物放在滑板上；卸车时，打开车厢后壁，汽车向前稍一开动，滑道内的铁球转动起来，整车货物很快就滑下来了。
