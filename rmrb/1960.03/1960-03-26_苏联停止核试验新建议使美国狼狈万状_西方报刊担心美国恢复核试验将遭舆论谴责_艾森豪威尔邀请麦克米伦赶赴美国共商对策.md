Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, Washington Dispatch: According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty's announcement yesterday, British Prime Minister Macmillan will arrive in Washington on the 26th to discuss with US President Eisenhower how to respond to the Soviet Union's new proposal on March 19 regarding the cessation of nuclear weapon testing.

Hagerty said that Macmillan was invited by Eisenhower and the talks will be held for two or three days starting on the 28th. Sources say they will also discuss issues related to the upcoming East-West summit conference.

Since the Soviet Union put forward its new proposal in order to seek an early agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing, the US government has been very passive. It is unwilling to accept the proposal, but it is also afraid of condemnation by world public opinion and dare not rashly refuse it. It is reported that in order to develop the nuclear warheads for American missiles, the United States has recently been stepping up preparations to resume nuclear testing and is looking for all kinds of excuses to oppose reaching an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing.

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The Soviet Union's new proposal on the cessation of nuclear weapon testing, put forward on the 19th at the Geneva conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests, has put the US ruling group, which is bent on resuming nuclear weapon testing, in an embarrassing situation.

The British "Scotsman" pointed out that the US ruling group was made very awkward by the new Soviet proposal because they were eager to resume nuclear weapon testing to improve the nuclear warheads of the "Polaris" and "Minuteman" missiles. Associated Press commentator Hightower even said on the 19th that the Soviet proposal "puts the United States in an unfortunate position," and Eisenhower will face a "difficult" decision. Hightower believes that "the United States will favor rejecting the Soviet proposal, but in order to avoid putting itself in a passive position in propaganda, the United States will put forward a counter-proposal." He also quoted US officials as saying that US preparations for resuming nuclear testing "will not be changed."

The Western press is worried that in the face of the new Soviet proposal, if the United States insists on resuming nuclear testing, it will be severely condemned by public opinion in various countries. The British "Sunday Times" wrote on the 20th: "It is difficult for the United States to resume nuclear testing now. If they resume testing, there will certainly be calls for an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and it is doubtful whether the United States can get a dozen votes in support." United Press International commentator Randall believed on the 21st that the West "faces a dilemma."

    苏联停止核试验新建议使美国狼狈万状
    西方报刊担心美国恢复核试验将遭舆论谴责
    艾森豪威尔邀请麦克米伦赶赴美国共商对策
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：据白宫新闻发布官哈格蒂昨天宣布，英国首相麦克米伦将在26日到华盛顿，同美国总统艾森豪威尔商讨如何应付苏联在19日提出的关于停止试验核武器的新建议。
    哈格蒂说，麦克米伦是应艾森豪威尔邀请前来的，会谈从28日开始将举行两三天。有消息说，他们还将讨论有关将要举行的东西方最高级会议的问题。
    自从苏联为了谋求早日就停止核试验问题达成协议而提出它的新建议以来，美国政府一直十分被动，它既不愿意接受这个建议，又害怕世界舆论的谴责而不敢贸然拒绝。据报道，美国为了要发展美国导弹的核弹头，最近一直加紧在准备恢复核试验，并且寻找一切借口来反对就停止核试验问题达成协议。
    据新华社22日讯　苏联19日在日内瓦苏美英三国不继续核武器试验会议上提出的关于停止核武器试验的新建议，使得一心想恢复核武器试验的美国统治集团陷于狼狈的境地。
    英国“苏格兰人报”指出，美国统治集团被苏联的新建议弄得十分尴尬，因为他们急于恢复核武器试验来改善“北极星”式导弹和“民兵”式导弹的核弹头。美联社评论员海托华19日甚至说，苏联这一建议“使得美国处于不幸的境地”，艾森豪威尔将面临作出一个“困难的”决定的局面。海托华认为，“美国将赞成拒绝苏联建议，但是为了避免使自己处于宣传上的被动地位，美国将提出一个对付方案。”他还引用美国官员的话说，美国恢复核武器试验的准备工作“将不作改变”。
    西方报刊担心，在苏联新建议的面前，美国如果硬要恢复核试验，将会遭到各国舆论的严厉谴责。英国“星期日泰晤士报”20日写道：“美国现在要恢复核试验是困难的。如果他们恢复试验，肯定会有人要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，而美国是否能得到一打支持票是有疑问的”。合众国际社评论员兰德耳21日认为，西方“面临进退维谷的处境”。
