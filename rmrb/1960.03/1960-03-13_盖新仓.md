	Walking from village to village,
	Electric waterwheels are humming and singing.
	Clear water, shallow waves,
	Irrigating the seedlings, making them fat and strong.
	We're not afraid of drought and cracked earth,
	We must speed up the building of new granaries.

    盖新仓走这村，到那庄，电动水车叮当响。清清的水，浅浅的浪，灌的苗儿肥又胖。天干地裂咱不怕，还得加快盖新仓。
