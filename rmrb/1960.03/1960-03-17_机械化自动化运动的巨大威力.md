The Great Power of the Mechanization and Automation Movement
Harbin Institute of Technology, Mechanical Manufacturing Technology and Equipment Design Professional Committee

Last November, we responded to the call of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Harbin Municipal Committee to increase the degree of mechanization and automation and to advance towards automation. We organized all teachers and some students to participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and automation in various factories in Harbin. In this movement, we combined teaching and scientific research to participate in the design and construction of twenty-four automatic production lines, as well as the technical summary and appraisal of the city's automation situation. Being in the torrent of this vigorous mass movement not only gave us the opportunity to contribute our strength to the cause of socialist construction, but also greatly inspired us to understand the development trend of science and technology in our country and to further clarify our scientific research direction.

Far-reaching Changes

The characteristics of Harbin's mechanization and automation movement are: wide scope, high speed, good effect, and low investment. These characteristics fully reflect the incomparable power of the general line of socialist construction.

Since the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting in October last year and promoted the experience of the initial automatic production lines for taps, saw blades, and cigarettes, the upsurge of automation has burned like a raging fire in factories and enterprises throughout the city. Whether new factories or old factories, large enterprises or small enterprises, whether in the machinery industry, light chemical industry, or basic construction units, and even the service industry, there were creations everywhere.

The mass movement for mechanization and automation in Harbin progressed extremely rapidly. In less than three months, more than 190 automatic production lines were put into production in the city, more than 600 machine tools were automated, and a large number of highly mechanized linked production lines and other technical innovation and technical revolution projects were implemented. According to "conventional" wisdom, such a short period of time would not even be enough for design and layer-by-layer review, and it would be impossible to imagine completing manufacturing, installation, and adjustment. However, the mass movement led by the Party was able to break through all "conventional" wisdom and create amazing speed. For example, the Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory has a highly automated tube plate automatic production line that can increase labor productivity by more than 17 times, and it only took 40 days from design to production; the automatic ball production line realized by the Harbin Bearing Factory only took four days.

Due to the realization of mechanization and automation in the production process, productivity and product quality have been greatly improved, and a situation has emerged everywhere where output has doubled without increasing personnel or equipment. For example, after the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory built an automatic tap production line, the equipment was reduced by one-third compared to the past, the workers were reduced by four-fifths compared to the past, but the annual output increased sharply by nine times; the saw blades produced by the automatic production line have the advantages of correct tooth shape, uniform tooth division, and sharp tooth edges, so they are more durable than before; after the automation of blowing and drawing glass tubes, the phenomenon of uneven thickness has been completely eliminated. A more prominent benefit brought by automation is that physical labor is greatly reduced and labor conditions are further improved. The workers of the Harbin Insulating Material Factory once wrote poetry to praise the automatic bakelite powder production line:

	Automatic line realized, no dust to be seen;
	No need to carry on shoulders, machine smashes the plastic sheets;
	Standing in front of the hot roller, labor-saving and safe.

These mechanization and automation projects were all realized with very little investment. For example, the automatic production line for bearing balls only cost seventy-five yuan, but the economic benefits it brought far exceeded this. The facts broke the view that "to engage in automatic lines, you have to spend more money."

At present, Harbin's mechanization and automation movement is no longer just the innovation of individual tools, but a comprehensive and complete innovation of the entire production process. This has a far-reaching impact on China's socialist construction. With the popularization and improvement of mechanization and automation, China's labor productivity will enter a new stage of more rapid growth, thereby providing an increasingly solid material and technical basis for accelerating socialist construction and transitioning to communism. At the same time, mechanization and automation will enable workers to gradually get rid of tedious physical labor, so as to better undertake the work of maintaining, repairing machinery and equipment, and creatively improving the entire production process, and give full play to their talents and wisdom; workers can have more time to learn knowledge in various aspects, improve their cultural level, and create conditions for eliminating the differences between physical and mental labor.

Breaking Superstition and Seeing "There's Always Someone Better"

Participating in Harbin's mechanization and automation movement is a good opportunity for us to learn and be educated. From practice, in addition to making us more deeply aware of the absolute necessity of relying on the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command, and the infinite power of mass movements and the endless wisdom of the working people, from the perspective of developing production and improving the level of science and technology, we also have the following points of understanding.

First, mechanization and automation are not mysterious. Every factory can do it, and everyone can do it. In the past, when people mentioned automation, they always felt it was profound and unattainable. In fact, this is a superstition. Taking drilling as an example, if you use your hand to directly hold a simple drill to drill holes in an iron plate, the physical exertion is very large, the efficiency is very low, and the drilled holes are difficult to achieve accuracy. After using a hand drill to achieve semi-mechanization, production efficiency and processing quality can be improved; changing the hand drill to be driven by a motor can further advance the productivity. Such a simple principle of continuously improving the degree of mechanization is something everyone can think of. As for automation, it is not very mysterious. For example, if the operation, observation, and adjustment of the machine are also replaced by machinery, so that one person can manage several machines to achieve semi-automation, only some control mechanisms need to be added, and the principle is not complicated, and general factories can manufacture it. If you add some automatic opening and closing fixtures and loading and unloading machines to make the loading and unloading also replaced by machinery, you can achieve single-machine automation; if you add some transportation mechanisms, automatic adjustment mechanisms, and signal systems to make the transportation of semi-finished products between each process also carried out by the corresponding mechanisms, you can form an automatic production line. These are universal laws for realizing mechanization and automation, and there is no profound truth. Of course, it does require hard work to realize the mechanization and automation of a certain machine from scratch, but this is by no means as difficult as climbing to the sky. For example, the workers of the Harbin Bristle Factory were inspired by the opening and closing of umbrellas and created a mechanical hand combing machine; seeing the chairs in the cinema automatically rise and fall as people sit and get up, they created a feeding mechanism. These examples show that in the process of realizing mechanization and automation, as long as you liberate your mind and use your brain, it is possible to find a solution.

Second, modern large factories are not the end-all-be-all, and small factories with poor equipment have a lot to offer. Harbin's mechanization and automation movement has prominently broken two kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas: one is that modern enterprises already have a high degree of mechanization and automation, and there is no need or possibility to engage in technological revolution; the other is that small factories have outdated equipment and weak technical forces, and cannot engage in mechanization and automation. However, countless facts have proved that the production efficiency of large factories has not "reached the top," and small factories are not "helpless," and some can even "leap to the sky in one step." Of course, specific factories should make different requirements according to different conditions. For example, places with more manual operation and heavy physical labor mainly realize the problems of semi-mechanization and mechanization; places with a higher degree of mechanization can consider overall mechanization and partial automation; factories with a considerable automation foundation should move towards automatic production lines, automatic workshops, and overall automation. However, not all factories have to follow this path, and there are still many factories that "leap to the sky in one step." For example, a workshop of the Jincheng Hardware Factory jumped from complete manual operation to complete automation. In short, conditions must be created by oneself, and one's hands and feet should not be bound by existing conditions.

Third, we should rationally use old and new equipment, rely on our own efforts, and engage in mechanization and automation in a diligent and frugal manner. At present, 75% to 90% of the automatic lines and automatic machines appearing in Harbin are transformed from the original equipment. This is one of the important reasons why many automatic production lines in Harbin are established quickly and with little investment. Sometimes, according to the needs of the new process, it is also necessary to add some new equipment. The selection of equipment should be specifically analyzed in conjunction with the adoption of new processes; it is wrong to not use the original equipment and redesign and manufacture everything; it is also wrong to think that new equipment is definitely not economical, and therefore unwilling to adopt new processes.

How to Popularize? How to Improve?

First, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of vigorously engaging in mechanization and automation, it is necessary to continuously organize the active balance of production, so that production can not only maintain a high speed, but also develop proportionally. For example, after mechanization and automation are realized, labor productivity will increase several times, so it is necessary to study how to make such a large production capacity fully utilized. For example, from the current point of view, casting, forging, and assembly occupy more labor and have greater labor intensity, so it is even more urgent to realize their mechanization and automation.

Second, new technologies and new processes should be adopted as much as possible. One of the characteristics of Harbin's vigorous mechanization and automation is that it not only connects the original equipment to become an automatic production line, but also adopts many new processes in the automation process. For example, the automatic nut production line of the Relay Factory saved six machine tools and increased the productivity by ten times because it used the cold heading process. Automation should also develop towards modern cutting-edge science and technology. For example, the use of hydraulic or electrical servo systems can make it possible to automate products with smaller batches; the use of electronic computing technology in machining can even automate single-piece and small-batch production; the application of electronics and atomic energy technology will measure the changes in many quantities that were originally impossible to measure in the measurement-to-processing process, such as the internal damage of metals and the thickness of electroplated layers, so that the processing quality can be guaranteed to be stable and reliable.

Third, the various mechanism components required for automation should be standardized and typified, and the machine tools used for automation should be "modularized" to promote the automation movement to develop forward at a higher speed. There are many similarities in the various equipment required for automation (such as power heads, gearboxes, loading mechanisms, pneumatic devices, hydraulic components, electrical components, etc.) that can be used universally. At present, when factories are engaged in mechanization and automation, they have to go through the process of pondering, designing, trial-producing, and mastering, which is a waste of time and energy. If there are specialized factories that produce standardized parts in batches and supply them centrally, many repetitive tasks can be omitted, and the speed of the automation movement can be developed forward faster. When engaging in automatic machines and automatic lines, due to the use of new technologies and new processes, it is necessary to manufacture some special equipment, but sometimes due to the inability to obtain special equipment for a while, it is necessary to give up the use of new technologies and new processes. If the various parts that make up various special machine tools can be standardized and centrally produced and supplied by specialized factories; when the product changes, they can be quickly pieced together into new machine tools to adapt to the needs of new products and new processes, which can save a lot of manpower and material resources.

Fourth, in order to adapt to the improvement of the degree of mechanization and automation, the level of production organization and management must be continuously improved. The continuous emergence of mechanization and automation will inevitably cause continuous changes in the production process, and production organization and management must quickly keep up in order to enable mechanization and automation equipment to play a greater role. For example, improve the maintenance and repair system so that the automatic line will not be stopped excessively due to temporary repairs; strengthen the supply of materials to avoid the phenomenon of work stoppage and waiting for materials after the increase in productivity; strengthen the supply of tools; improve the quality inspection system; and, more urgently, train the technical forces needed to adapt to production automation, etc.

Harbin's mechanization and automation movement is developing in depth and breadth. In order to climb the peak of automation technology and accelerate China's socialist construction, the teachers and students of the Mechanical Manufacturing Technology major of our Harbin Institute of Technology will, under the leadership of the Party, continue to cooperate with factories, enterprises, and brother units to produce products, write articles, and train new people, and contribute our strength in the process of realizing the overall mechanization and automation of the motherland's industrial production.

    机械化自动化运动的巨大威力
    哈尔滨工业大学机械制造工艺及其设备设计专业委员会
    去年11月，我们响应了中共黑龙江省委和哈尔滨市委发出的提高机械化自动化程度、向自动化进军的号召，组织全体教师和一部分同学参加了哈尔滨市各工厂以机械化、自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。在这一运动中，我们结合教学和科学研究工作，参加了二十四条自动生产线的设计和建造，以及全市自动化情况的技术总结、鉴定等工作。置身于这一轰轰烈烈的群众运动的洪流中，不仅使我们有机会对社会主义建设事业贡献出自己的一份力量，而且对认识我国科学技术发展趋势，进一步明确我们的科学研究方向，有很大启发。
    影响深远的变革
    哈尔滨市机械化自动化运动的特点是：范围广、速度高、效果好、投资少。这些特点充分体现了社会主义建设总路线的无比威力。
    自从去年10月中共哈尔滨市委召开现场会议，推广了丝锥、锯条、卷烟等最初的几条自动生产线的经验以后，自动化的热潮犹如熊熊烈火，在全市各工厂企业普遍燃烧起来。不论新厂、老厂，不论是大企业、小企业，不论是机械工业、轻化工业，或是基本建设单位，以至服务行业，到处都有创造。
    哈尔滨市大搞机械化自动化的群众运动进展极快，在不到三个月的时间里，全市投入生产的自动生产线就有一百九十多条，有六百多台机床实现了单机自动化，还有大批高度机械化的联动生产线等技术革新与技术革命项目。按照“常规”，这么短短的时间，仅设计和层层审查都来不及，根本不能设想还能完成制造、安装、调整等工作。但是，党所领导的群众运动，竟能冲破一切“常规”，创造出惊人的速度。如哈尔滨第一工具厂有一条能提高劳动生产率十七倍多的高度自动化的管子板牙自动生产线，从设计到投入生产只用了四十天；哈尔滨轴承厂实现的滚珠自动生产线，只用了四天。
    由于生产过程实现了机械化和自动化，生产率和产品质量大大提高，到处出现不增人、不增设备产量加番的局面。如哈尔滨量具刃具厂建成了丝锥自动生产线以后，设备比过去减少了三分之一，工人比过去减少了五分之四，而年产量却猛增九倍；用自动生产线生产出的锯片，具有齿形正确、分齿均匀、齿口锋利等优点，因而比过去更加耐用；吹拉玻璃管实现自动化后，完全消除了厚薄不匀的现象。自动化带来的更突出的好处，是体力劳动大为减轻，劳动条件进一步得到改善。哈尔滨市绝缘材料厂的工人曾这样做诗歌颂胶木粉自动生产线：
    实现自动线，粉尘看不见；
    运输不用肩，机器砸胶片；
    站在热滚前，省力又安全。
    这些机械化、自动化项目的实现，都只用了很少的投资。如轴承滚珠自动生产线的实现只用了七十五元，而它所带来的经济收益却远远超过于此。事实打破了“要搞自动线，就得多花钱”的观点。
    目前，哈尔滨市的机械化自动化运动已不仅仅是个别工具的革新，而是整个生产过程全面地整套地革新，这一点对于我国的社会主义建设具有深远的影响。随着机械化自动化的普及和提高，我国劳动生产率将进入更加飞快增长的新阶段，从而为加速社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡提供愈益雄厚的物质技术基础。同时，机械化自动化将使工人逐渐摆脱繁琐的体力劳动，从而更好地担负起维护、检修机器设备和创造性地改进整个生产过程的工作，充分发挥他们的才能和智慧；工人们可以有更多时间学习各方面的知识，提高文化水平，为消除体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别创造条件。
    打破迷信看到“天外有天”
    参加哈尔滨市的机械化自动化运动，对我们来说是一个很好的学习和受教育的机会。从实践中，除了使我们更加深刻地认识到依靠党的领导、坚持政治挂帅的绝对必要，和群众运动的无比威力、劳动人民智慧的无穷无尽等以外，从发展生产和提高科学技术水平的角度，我们还有以下几点体会。
    第一，机械化自动化并不神秘，厂厂都可搞，人人都能搞。过去人们一提自动化，总觉得深奥莫测，高不可攀。其实这是一种迷信。以钻孔为例，如果用手直接握持简单的钻子在铁板上钻孔，体力消耗很大，效率很低，而且钻出的孔很难达到精确。改用手摇钻实现半机械化后，生产效率和加工质量就可以提高；把手摇再改为电动机带动，生产率又可往前跨进一大步。这样一个不断提高机械化程度的简单道理，是大家都能想到的。至于自动化，也不是很神秘的，如把机器的操纵、观测和调整也由机械来代替，使一个人可以管若干台机器，实现半自动化，只要增加一些控制机构就行了，原理并不复杂，一般工厂都能制造。如果再增加一些自动开合的夹具和上下料机，使上下料也由机械代替，就实现了单机自动化；如果再添设一些运输机构、自动调节机构和讯号系统，使各工序间的半成品运送也由相应的机构来执行时，就形成了自动生产线。这些都是实现机械化自动化带有普遍性的规律，并没有什么高深莫测的道理。当然，从无到有地实现某种机器的机械化和自动化，确实需要刻苦钻研，但这也决不是难如登天的。如哈尔滨市猪鬃工厂工人看到雨伞的开合，得到了启发，就创造出机械手梳毛机；看到电影院的椅子随人的坐起而自动起落，就创造出装料机构。这些例子都说明在实现机械化自动化过程中，只要解放思想，开动脑筋，就有可能找到解决的办法。
    第二，现代化的大厂“天外有天”，设备差的小厂大有可为。哈尔滨市的机械化、自动化运动突出地打破了两种右倾保守思想：一种是认为现代化企业机械化自动化程度已经很高，不需要也不可能再搞技术革命；一种是认为小型工厂设备陈旧，技术力量薄弱，搞不了机械化自动化。但是，无数事实证明，大厂的生产效率并没“到顶”，小厂也不是就“没办法”，甚至有的还可“一步登天”。当然，对于具体的厂应该根据不同的条件，提出不同要求。如手工操作和笨重体力劳动较多的地方，主要是实现半机械化和机械化的问题；机械化程度较高的地方就可以考虑全盘机械化和部分自动化的问题；已有相当的自动化基础的工厂就应向自动生产线、自动车间、全盘自动化迈进。但是，也并不是所有的厂都要按着这样的步子走，“一步登天”的厂还是不少的。如金城五金厂一个车间就由全部手工操作一跃而实现全盘自动化。总之，条件要靠自己去创造，不要让现有条件束缚了自己的手脚。
    第三，应该合理运用新老设备，自力更生地勤俭地搞机械化和自动化。目前，哈尔滨市出现的自动线和自动机，75％到90％都是以原有设备为基础改装而成的。这是哈尔滨市许多自动生产线建立得快和投资少的重要原因之一。有时，根据新工艺的需要，也需要添置一些新设备。设备的选用应结合新工艺的采用做具体分析；不用原有设备，一切都重新设计制造的做法是不对的；认为新添设备就一定不经济，因而不愿采用新工艺也是不对的。
    怎样普及？如何提高？
    第一，在大搞机械化、自动化的技术革新和技术革命运动中必须不断地组织生产的积极平衡，使生产既是持续高速度，又能按比例地发展。如实现机械化、自动化以后，劳动生产率成倍增长，这就必须研究怎样才能使这样大的生产能力得到充分的发挥。再如从目前看来，铸、锻和装配占用劳动力较多、劳动强度较大，如何使它们实现机械化自动化，就显得更加迫切。
    第二，要尽可能地采用新技术新工艺。哈尔滨市大搞机械化自动化的特点之一，就是不仅将原有设备联结起来成为一条自动生产线，而且还在自动化过程中采用了许多新工艺。如继电器厂的螺帽自动生产线就是因为运用了冷墩工艺，才使机床节省了六台、而生产率却提高了十倍。自动化还应向近代的尖端科学技术方面发展。如液压或电气随动系统的运用，可使批量较小的产品也可能实现自动化；电子计算技术用于机械加工，甚至单件小批生产也可以实现自动化；电子学和原子能技术的应用，将测量到加工过程中本来无法测量的许多量的变化，如金属内部的损伤、电镀层的厚度，使加工质量得到稳定可靠的保证。
    第三，自动化所需要的各种机构元件应标准化、典型化，自动化所用的机床应“积木化”，以促进自动化运动以更高的速度向前发展。自动化所需要的各种设备（如动力头、变速箱、装料机构、气动装置、液压元件、电气元件等）有很多类似之处，可以通用。目前，各工厂搞机械化自动化时，都要经过琢磨、设计、试制、掌握的过程，这在时间上和精力上是一种浪费。如果有专门工厂将标准化后的部件成批生产，集中供应，就可以省略很多重复劳动，使自动化运动的速度更快地向前发展。在搞自动机和自动线时，由于新技术新工艺的运用，需要制造一些专门设备，而有时由于专用设备一时还不能得到，就不得不放弃运用新技术新工艺。如果能使组成各种专用机床的各种部件标准化，由专门工厂集中生产，集中供应；当产品一旦改变时，可以迅速拼凑成新的机床，以适应新产品、新工艺的需要，那就可以节省很多人力物力。
    第四，为了适应机械化自动化程度的提高，必须不断改进生产组织和管理工作的水平。机械化和自动化的不断出现不可避免地会在生产过程中不断引起变化，必须使生产组织和管理工作很快跟上去，才能使机械化自动化设备发挥更大作用。如健全维护修理制度，使自动线不致因临时修理而过多地停车；加强材料供应，避免在生产率提高后出现停工待料现象；加强工具供应；改进质量检验制度；还有更迫切的，是培训适应生产自动化所需的技术力量等。
    哈尔滨市的机械化、自动化运动正向深广发展。为了攀登自动化技术的高峰，加速我国的社会主义建设，我们哈尔滨工业大学机械制造工艺专业师生，将在党的领导下，继续与工厂企业和兄弟单位协作，出产品、出文章、出新人，在实现祖国工业生产全盘机械化和自动化的过程中，贡献出我们的力量。
