    Everything for Production
    Jing Yu

    Fully organizing the people's production and life is the most pressing concern for commercial departments and residents today.

    A few months ago, Shangxin Street in Chongqing was a rare Red Flag Street. Now, the Red Flag of Shangxin Street is flying throughout the city. A few months ago, Guangfu Road in Tianjin was also a unique Red Flag Road. Now, the Red Flag of Guangfu Road is also being planted throughout the city. The Tongjialiang Store is also now fully organizing the people's economic life. How can people not care about such an organization and activity that is of great benefit to the people's livelihood and social production? How can such a new thing that is enthusiastically cared for by the people not grow and develop rapidly?

    Commercial departments are generally thought to be doing things like supply, sales, transfer, and storage. Now, to engage in the comprehensive organization of the people's production and life is a completely new thing, and also a completely correct approach. Commercial departments are closely linked to production on one end and closely linked to consumption on the other. If there is any problem with either production or consumption, it will quickly be reflected in the commercial circulation. There was once a very touching story: Workers at the Tianjin Tianhong Electric Appliance Factory and employees of the Guangfu Road Store launched a competition. The workers proposed: "Keep working across the new year, double the output!" The salespeople of Guangfu Road replied: "As long as production rises day by day, we are willing to bend our backs for the workers." As a result, last year's annual production plan was completed twenty-seven days ahead of schedule. The factory summarized three points of the overproduction experience: First, the Party led well; second, the workers were highly motivated; and third, the Guangfu Road Store provided strong support. This fully demonstrates that organizing the people's economic life is an urgent requirement for the development of socialist construction, and it is a new development of financial and trade departments serving production and serving the people's livelihood.

    For the continued leap forward of the national economy, we must greatly promote the large-scale collaboration between financial and trade departments and material supply departments in organizing production and serving the people's lives. The objective situation of continuous leap forward tells people that a modern, collectivized large-scale production cannot be compatible with the individual lifestyle of a scattered small family. In fact, the more people participate in production, especially the more women participate in production, the more housework, such as eating, dressing, burning, living, and using, is brought to society, and many tasks such as dismantling, washing, pulping, and sewing are also brought to society. What to do? The only way is to establish and develop a lifestyle that is compatible with the development of the socialist mode of production, gradually realize the socialization of housework, gradually realize the collectivization of life, and organize the entire economic life more rationally.

    Organizing the people's economic life is essentially a production issue. People are the decisive factor in productivity, and ensuring the rational needs of the people's lives is a necessary condition for developing production. In this sense, serving the people's lives is also serving production and construction. The impact of organizing the people's economic life well on promoting the high-speed development of production is immeasurable, and the impact on changing people's mental outlook is even more immeasurable.

    一切为了生产
    静宇
    全面组织人民的生产和生活，是当前商业部门和居民们最关心的事情。
    几个月以前，重庆的上新街还是属于凤毛麟角的红旗街，现在，上新街的红旗已经飘扬全市了。几个月以前，天津的光复道也是独一无二的红旗道，现在光复道的红旗也正在遍插全市了。同家梁商店现在也在全面组织人民经济生活了。像这样一个对人民生活、社会生产具有极大好处的组织和活动，人们怎能不关心它呢？像这样为人们热忱关心的新事物，又怎能不迅速成长、迅速发展呢？
    商业部门，一般人认为是做供、销、调、存等事情的，现在搞起全面组织人民的生产和生活来，这完全是新的事情，也是完全正确的作法。商业部门一头紧密联系着生产，另一头紧密联系着消费，生产和消费，哪一头有了什么问题，很快就在商业流转中反映出来。曾经有过这样一件十分感人的故事：天津天虹电虹电器厂工人与光复道商店职工展开竞赛，工人提出：“跨年不下马，产量再加番”，光复道的售货员回答：“只要生产日日高，愿为工人折断腰”。结果，去年全年的生产计划提前二十七天完成了。工厂总结超产经验有三条：一、党领导得好；二、工人干劲足；三、光复道商店有力支援。这完全说明了组织人民经济生活是社会主义建设发展的迫切要求，是财贸部门为生产服务、为人民生活服务的新发展。
    为了国民经济的继续跃进，我们要大大提倡财贸部门和物资供应部门一起组织生产上的和人民生活服务方面的大协作。持续跃进的客观形势告诉人们：一个现代化集体化的大生产，是不可能同一个分散的小家庭的个体生活方式相适应的。事实上，参加生产的人数愈多，特别是参加生产的妇女愈多，许多家务事情，如吃的，穿的，烧的，住的，用的，都提到社会上来了，许多拆、洗、浆、缝等事务也提到社会上来了。怎么办？唯一的办法，根据社会主义生产方式的发展，建立和发展与之相适应的生活方式，逐步实现家务劳动社会化，逐步实现生活集体化，把整个经济生活更加合理地组织起来。
    组织人民经济生活，实质上是一个生产问题。人是生产力的决定因素，保证人民生活的合理需要，是发展生产的必要条件。从这个意义上说，为人民生活服务也就是为生产建设服务。组织好人民经济生活，对于促进高速度发展生产所起的影响是无法估量的，对于改变人们的精神面貌，更是无法估量的。
