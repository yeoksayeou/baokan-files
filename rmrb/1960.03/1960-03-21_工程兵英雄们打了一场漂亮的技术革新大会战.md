Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The Second Congress of Activists of the Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army closed in Beijing today. This was a gathering of heroes to review achievements and exchange experiences, and also a rally to promote communist spirit and launch a technical innovation and revolution campaign. More than 700 delegates, with the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, launched a massive "brainstorming, proposing topics widely, and planning at all levels" "great battle" at the meeting. Over the past twelve days, they put forward more than 20,000 rationalization proposals, making the spearhead of technical innovation and technical revolution rapidly point to the new stage of mechanization, electrification, automation of engineering operations, and modernization of engineering technical equipment.

    During the meeting, the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and others, received all the representatives. Marshal Chen Yi addressed the meeting. Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Fu Zhong and Gan Siqi, Deputy Directors of the General Political Department, also spoke at the meeting.

    The meeting opened on the 8th of this month. After listening to the report of the leaders of the Engineering Corps on further promoting technical revolution and cultural revolution, the delegates quickly launched a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution around the issues of construction operations, mechanical equipment, scientific research, and military training, extensively proposing topics, tackling key problems, finding measures, and claiming topics. Heroes from all walks of life fought day and night, learning from each other, contributing treasures, and engaging in large-scale cooperation, turning the gathering of heroes into an innovation competition and design planning meeting to climb the peaks of modern science and technology. On the afternoon of the 10th, the Jinan area Engineering Corps activist delegation took the lead in posting a big-character poster "Fighting for one day and night, proposing 2,000 topics," and the other nine delegations immediately responded, successively proposing more than 20,000 new topics for technical innovation and technical revolution. The presidium of the conference immediately transferred responsible military officers and professional technical cadres from departments such as the engineering department to form a topic research group, classified and sorted out the various topics proposed by the delegates, and issued them to the various delegations for item-by-item research. At the same time, representatives of many technical innovation pioneers and advanced collectives reported on their glorious deeds and advanced experiences at the meeting. All the representatives also enthusiastically visited the Engineering Corps' new equipment and technical innovation achievement exhibition attached to the conference. Among these exhibits were various mechanized, semi-mechanized, electrified, and automated mechanical equipment, construction machinery, and operating tools created or modified by officers and soldiers. Through on-site operation demonstrations, the ideas of the delegates on making technical revolution were further expanded and their wisdom was enriched. Then, more than 700 representatives formed 24 professional groups according to their respective majors, and conducted in-depth discussions and research, being both realistic and pragmatic, both contributing treasures and learning from each other, claiming topics one after another, and proposing preliminary solutions and time for completing the claimed topics, so that more than 20,000 technical innovation and technical revolution topics were implemented on the spot. These topics included both relatively simple machine tool innovation projects, as well as complex and major projects of high, large, precise, and cutting-edge technology, both projects that can be completed immediately in the near future, and long-term scientific research goals.

    In claiming topics and studying implementation plans, all the representatives generally promoted the spirit of communist collaboration. They not only learned from each other, but also took the initiative to deliver treasures to their doorsteps. The Guangzhou area Engineering Corps activist delegation sent the four sets of 35 drawings of complete mechanization of woodworking operations already realized by a certain processing plant of their troops to the Jinan, Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing and other troops delegations respectively. The Nanjing area Engineering Corps activist delegation also presented the "Compilation of Technical Innovations" with charts, creation process and experience to various delegations. Representatives of a certain unit proposed to realize the innovation topic of complete mechanization of a certain operation, including matching electrification of perforation and blasting and mechanization of muck removal. This topic immediately attracted a large number of representatives, and representatives of ten units cooperated greatly, studied day and night, quickly proposed a preliminary plan to complete this topic, and drew a schematic diagram of matching and integrating.

    While many representatives were investing in this "great battle" within the conference, they also sent telegrams, made phone calls, and wrote letters to their troops, asking officers and soldiers to work together. The various organs, troops, and universities stationed in Beijing also took advantage of the conference to launch a technical innovation upsurge of proposing topics and offering suggestions. Qian Changsheng, deputy director of the Political Department directly under the Engineering Corps, rushed back on the afternoon of the second day after the Jinan troops delegation posted the big-character poster, convened a meeting of the assistant commissioners of major departments, and the assistant commissioners of major departments mobilized the officers and soldiers overnight, calling on them to fight for one day and night and propose innovation topics. Many officers and soldiers worked until after 3:00 a.m., proposing more than 3,000 technical innovation topics. In this way, from inside to outside the conference, from the capital to the whole country, the entire Engineering Corps troops launched a new upsurge of marching towards science and technology.

    A total of 734 representatives of advanced collectives and activists of the Engineering Corps attended this meeting. They are outstanding representatives of the Engineering Corps who have made brilliant contributions to the construction of the armed services and the participation in socialist construction. In recent years, while actively performing the task of defending the socialist cause, all officers and soldiers of the Engineering Corps have actively participated in and supported the country's economic construction in various aspects. According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, officers and soldiers have participated in the construction of 103 factories, 78 reservoirs, more than 1,700 bridges, more than 7,500 kilometers of highways, as well as the construction tasks of Beijing-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Nanjing and other railways. At the same time, officers and soldiers of the Engineering Corps also used manpower, material resources, and technology to vigorously support the disaster relief work in many areas, and protect the lives and property of the people in the disaster areas. All this has not only greatly improved the communist consciousness of the officers and soldiers, but also further strengthened the flesh-and-blood relationship between the military and the people.

    At the closing ceremony held today, the leading organs of the Engineering Corps awarded 339 advanced collectives and 279 model individuals, and awarded them flags and certificates respectively.

    The conference adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    The delegates to the conference also put forward a letter of proposal to all comrades of the Engineering Corps. The proposal calls on all officers and soldiers to set off a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, everyone to establish lofty ambitions and great aspirations, to make great technical revolution and cultural revolution, to strive to climb the peak of science and technology, to make more efforts, and to strive to quickly achieve mechanization, electrification and automation of technical equipment, engineering measures, and engineering operations in the shortest possible time.

    工程兵英雄们打了一场漂亮的技术革新大会战
    新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军工程兵第二届积极分子代表会议，今天在北京闭幕。这是一个检阅成绩、交流经验的群英大会，也是一个共产主义风格大发扬和大闹技术革新与技术革命的誓师大会。出席会议的七百多名代表，以敢想敢说敢做的精神，在会上发动了声势浩大的“大胆设想、广提课题、层层规划”的“大会战”，十二天来提出合理化建议两万多项，使技术革新和技术革命的锋芒迅速指向工程作业机械化、电动化、自动化和工程技术装备现代化的新阶段。
    会议期间，中共中央领导人刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平等接见了全体代表。陈毅元帅到会讲了话。中国人民解放军副总参谋长张爱萍上将，总政治部副主任傅钟上将、甘泗淇上将，也在会上讲了话。
    这次会议于本月8日开幕。代表们听了工程兵首长关于进一步大搞技术革命和文化革命的报告之后，迅速围绕着施工作业、机械装备、科学研究、兵种训练等问题，轰轰烈烈地掀起了广泛提课题、攻关键、找措施、认领课题的技术革新和技术革命的新高潮。各路英雄连夜奋战，互相取经、献宝，大搞协作，使群英会变成了攀登现代科学技术高峰的革新竞赛会和设计规划会。10日下午，济南地区工程兵积极分子代表团一马当先贴出了“奋战一昼夜，提出课题两千个”的大字报，其余九个代表团立即群起响应，接踵提出了二万多项技术革新和技术革命的新课题。大会主席团当即抽调工程处等部门的负责军官和专业技术干部，成立了课题研究组，把代表们提出的各种课题进行分类整理，印发给各代表团逐项研究。与此同时，许多技术革新的闯将和先进集体的代表在大会上报告了他们的光荣事迹和先进经验。全体代表又兴致勃勃地参观了大会附设的工程兵新装备和技术革新成就展览会。这些展品中，有官兵们创制或改制的各种各样的机械化、半机械化、电动化、自动化的机械装备、施工机械和作业工具，通过现场操作表演，更进一步地扩大了代表们大闹技术革命的思路，丰富了代表们的智慧。接着，七百多名代表根据各人的专业分别组成了二十四个专业小组，深入展开讨论研究，既务虚，又务实，既献宝，又取经，纷纷认领课题，并提出完成认领的课题的初步解决方案和时间，使两万多个技术革新和技术革命的课题当场落到了实处。这些课题中，既有比较简单的机具革新项目，也有高、大、精、尖的复杂重大项目，既有当前马上就能完成的项目，也有远期科学研究的奋斗目标。
    在认领课题和研究实现方案中，全体代表普遍发扬了共产主义大协作的风格。他们不仅互相取经，而且主动送宝上门。广州地区工程兵积极分子代表团把他们所在部队某加工厂已经实现了木工作业配套成龙、全部机械化的四套三十五件图纸分别送给了济南、北京、沈阳、南京等部队代表团。南京地区工程兵积极分子代表团也把附有图表、创造过程和经验的“技术革新汇编”分别赠送了各个代表团。某部代表提出要把某项作业全部实现机械化的革新课题，其中包括把穿孔爆破电动化、排碴机械化等配套成龙。这一课题，立即吸引了广大代表，十个单位的代表大搞协作，日夜钻研，迅速提出了完成这一课题的初步方案，并绘制了配套成龙的示意图。
    许多代表在会内投入这场“大会战”的同时，又纷纷发电报、打电话、写信给自己的部队，要求官兵们一起动手。驻京各机关、部队、院校也大借会议的东风，风起云涌地掀起了提课题、献计策的技术革新高潮。工程兵直属政治处副主任钱长生，在济南部队代表团贴出大字报的第二天下午就赶回去，召开了各大部协理员会议，各大部协理员又连夜分别向广大官兵作了动员，号召奋战一昼夜，大提革新课题。很多官兵一直干到下半夜三点多钟，提出了三千多个技术革新的课题。这样，从会内到会外，从首都到全国，整个工程兵部队都掀起了向科学技术大进军的新高潮。
    出席这次会议的工程兵先进集体和积极分子代表共七百三十四人。他们都是工程兵部队在兵种建设和参加社会主义建设中作出光辉贡献的杰出代表。几年来，工程兵全体官兵在积极地执行社会主义事业的保卫者的任务的同时，从各个方面积极参加和支援了国家的经济建设。据不完全统计，几年来，官兵们参加修建了一百零三座工厂，七十八座水库，一千七百多座桥梁，七千五百多公里公路，以及京广、沪宁等铁路建设任务。同时，工程兵部队官兵还用人力、物力、技术等大力支援了许多地区的抢险救灾工作，保卫了灾区人民生命和财产的安全。这一切，不仅大大提高了官兵们的共产主义觉悟，而且进一步密切了军民间的血肉关系。
    在今天举行的大会闭幕式上，工程兵领导机关奖励了三百三十九个先进集体和二百七十九个模范人物，分别向他们颁发了奖旗和奖状。
    大会通过了给党中央和毛主席的致敬电。
    到会代表还向工程兵全体同志提出了倡议书。倡议书中要求全体官兵掀起一个学习毛主席著作的热潮，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，人人树雄心、立大志，大闹技术革命和文化革命，努力攀登科学技术的高峰，把干劲鼓得更足，力求在最短期间内，迅速地实现技术装备、工程措施、工程作业等方面的机械化、电动化和自动化。
