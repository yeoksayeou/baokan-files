Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 23rd: "Pyongyang News" published a commentary today entitled "A New Model of Peaceful Coexistence," stating that the agreement between China and Nepal on the boundary question and the economic assistance agreement are another excellent example of Asian countries developing mutual friendship and cooperation, making an important contribution to consolidating peace in the whole of Asia.

The commentary stated that these agreements demonstrate that the good-neighborly relations between China and Nepal, guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have entered a new stage.

The newspaper pointed out that recently, US imperialism and its spokesmen have continuously slandered China, attempting to undermine the high prestige of the People's China, and intending to create divisions between China and its neighboring countries. However the signing of the Sino-Burmese agreement on the boundary question and the Sino-Burman Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression in January, and now the agreement to fully resolve the Sino-Nepalese boundary question, are a victory for the Chinese government's consistent adherence to a peaceful foreign policy, and a serious blow to the instigators of US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 23rd: "Capital Hanoi Newspaper" published a commentary today on the signing of the boundary agreement between China and Nepal, saying that the people of the world have once again seen a new victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and everyone more clearly sees that the Chinese people and government have always pursued a foreign policy of peace and friendship towards neighboring countries.

The commentary mentioned Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India, saying that the Asian people and peace-loving people of the world hope that the leaders of the world's two largest nations will properly resolve the boundary disputes between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, March 23rd: The Yangon Chinese newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial today saying that the agreement between China and Nepal on the boundary question and the economic assistance agreement are another gratifying event following the signing of the Sino-Burmese boundary agreement and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression. The editorial emphasized that the signing of the Sino-Nepalese boundary agreement once again proves that there are no problems between Asian and African countries that cannot be resolved through peaceful negotiations.

The newspaper pointed out that the boundary issues between China and some of its neighbors are complex issues left over from history. Imperialist schemers have always attempted to use boundary issues to undermine the friendly relations between China and its neighboring countries, and to seize opportunities to create chaos. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, imperialists have spared no effort to slander China.

The editorial emphasized that China strictly adheres to a good-neighborly policy and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China has not only not occupied an inch of other countries' territory, but has also concluded boundary agreements with its neighbors Burma and Nepal, resolving long-standing boundary issues that have existed for hundreds of years. This proves that China has no "aggressive" intentions towards its neighbors, and will never have such intentions in the future.

    和平共处原则的新胜利
    朝越报纸欢迎中尼两个协定
    据新华社平壤23日电　“平壤新闻”今天发表题为“和平共处的新榜样”的评论说，中国和尼泊尔签订的关于两国边界问题的协定和经济援助协定是亚洲国家发展互相友好和合作的又一个很好的榜样，它对巩固整个亚洲的和平有重要的贡献。
    评论说，这些协定说明，以和平共处五项原则为指针的中国和尼泊尔两国之间的睦邻关系，进入了一个新阶段。
    这家报纸指出，最近一个时期，美帝国主义及其代言人，不断中伤中国，企图损害人民中国的高度威信，并打算在中国和它的邻国之间制造裂缝。但是，今年1月间签订了中缅关于两国边界问题的协定和中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，这次又签订了全面解决中尼边界问题的协定，这是中国政府一贯坚持和平外交政策的胜利，也是对美帝国主义挑拨者的严重打击。
    据新华社河内23日电　“首都河内报”今天就中国和尼泊尔签订边界问题协定发表评论说，世界人民又看到了和平共处五项原则的一个新的胜利，大家更清楚地看到了中国人民和政府一向奉行对邻国和平、友好的外交政策。
    评论谈到周恩来总理即将访问印度这一事件时说，亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民希望世界两个最大民族的领导人根据和平共处五项原则良好地解决两国边界问题的争端。
    新华社仰光23日电　仰光华侨报纸“人民报”今天发表社论说，中国和尼泊尔缔结的关于两国边界问题的协定和经济援助协定，是继中缅边界协定以及友好和互不侵犯条约签订以后的另一个令人高兴的事件。社论强调说，中尼边界协定的签订再次证明，在亚非国家之间是没有什么问题不能通过和平谈判来解决的。
    这家报纸指出，中国和一些邻国的边界问题是历史上遗留下来的复杂问题。帝国主义阴谋家一直企图利用边界问题来破坏中国同邻国之间的友好关系，并且利用机会来制造混乱。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，帝国主义者一直不遗余力地诽谤中国。
    社论强调指出，中国严格奉行睦邻政策和和平共处五项原则。中国不但没有占取别国的一寸领土，而且同它的邻国缅甸和尼泊尔还缔结了边界协定，解决了几百年来长期存在的边界问题。这证明中国对它的邻国毫无“侵略”意图，而且将来也决不会有这种意图。
