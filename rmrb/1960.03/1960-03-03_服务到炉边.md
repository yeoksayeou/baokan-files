    Service to the Furnaceside
    (Our report) Workers in the commercial and service departments of the Shijingshan area of Fengtai District, Beijing, are doing everything possible to improve their service attitude, going deep into workshops and furnacesides to supply goods and serve the workers of factories and enterprises such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company.
    Based on the characteristics of the Shijingshan area, the employees put forward the slogan "Everything for more steel and iron production, be a good logistics department." They walked out of the counters, organized mobile sales carts, and delivered goods such as cigarettes, pastries, and fruits to construction sites, workshops, and furnacesides. They also set up thirty-eight service points for repair, photography, breakfast, etc., in major workshops, construction sites, canteens, and dormitories. Hairdressing departments were set up in lounges and bathhouses, repair departments in bicycle storage areas, and photography departments in theaters. "Three Furnaces Stores" were set up in the blast furnace, converter, and coking furnace workshops. In order to adapt to the three-shift working hours of steel workers, the store business hours are from 6:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the night; the canteen is also open day and night to facilitate the workers. Whenever workers create new records in production or encounter high-yield days, major repairs, performance competitions, and crash production tasks, commercial employees deliver goods to the site, and also comfort workers and encourage their enthusiasm for labor.
    In a thank-you letter to the employees of the commercial and service departments, the workers wrote: "The General Line is a bright light, shining everywhere for a good start, commerce supports the front line, production rises day by day."

    服务到炉边
    本报讯　北京市丰台区石景山地区的商业、服务部门的职工，千方百计改善服务态度，深入车间、炉旁供应商品，为石景山钢铁公司等工厂企业的工人服务。
    职工们根据石景山地区的特点，提出了“一切为了多出钢和铁，当好后勤部”的口号。他们走出柜台，组织流动售货车，把纸烟、糕点、水果等商品送到工地、车间和炉旁；还在主要的车间、工地、食堂和宿舍设立了修理、照相、早点等三十八个服务点。休息室和浴池设有理发部，存车处设有修车部，剧场设有照相部。在高炉、转炉、焦炉车间，设立了“三炉商店”。为了适应钢铁职工三班倒的上班时间，商店营业时间从早六点一直到夜里一点；食堂也是日夜营业，方便职工。每当职工在生产上创造了新纪录或遇到高产日、大检修、表演赛和突击生产任务时，商业职工就把货送到现场，还慰问工人，鼓舞职工的劳动热情。
    工人们在给商业、服务部门职工的感谢信中写道：“总路线是明灯，照得处处开门红，商业支持第一线，生产天天向上升。”
