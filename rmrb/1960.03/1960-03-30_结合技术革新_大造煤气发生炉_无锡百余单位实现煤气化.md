Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 29th. More than one hundred units in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, have achieved gasification in production and daily life.

In the movement of technological innovation and technical revolution, the city has vigorously promoted gasification. After a half-month of intensive effort, as of March 18, the city has built 491 gas producers of various sizes, of which 75% have already been put into use. The utilization of gas has expanded from burning boilers to firing kilns, melting materials, forging, and iron casting. Coal consumption is generally reduced by 30% to 50% compared to the past.

The Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has regarded the promotion of gas producers as an important part of the city's efforts to engage in technological revolution in all walks of life, and the work is personally led by the Secretary of the Municipal Committee, thus forming a mass movement to vigorously build gas producers. Workers at textile factories such as Shenxin and Lixin built large-scale gas producers of 21 and 23 cubic meters in just seven days and nights. After workers at the Mining Machinery Factory heard the news that the Forging Factory was using gas to forge iron, they sent people to the factory at night to "learn from the experience." After returning to the factory, they immediately formed a shock team of more than 100 people and built two gas producers for forging iron overnight. In the Be塘 District, the masses built 94 gas stoves for domestic use in two days, enabling more than 70 factories and some stores in the district to use gas in their daily lives.

Wuxi City has conscientiously implemented the policy of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods in the intensive construction of gas stoves. In the construction of a gas stove in a central canteen in Nanchang District, old bricks and broken bricks were used to build the furnace body, and broken vat pieces were hammered into powdered sand to replace refractory mud for repairing the furnace lining. It only cost 4.5 yuan to build a gas producer that did not require refractory bricks, a blower, or pipes. Coal consumption was reduced by 50% compared to the past. In the vigorous promotion of gasification, various units also carried forward the spirit of communist cooperation, ensuring that everyone helps when one family has difficulties. When Weixin Dyeing Factory lacked oxygen when welding gas pipes, the workers of Qinsheng Cloth Factory sent the oxygen in their factory to support them after hearing about it. In order to help brother units build stoves, the Forging Factory also sent four skilled workers to various factories in turn to provide guidance, which was warmly welcomed and promoted the stove building work.

Now, while actively building new stoves (323 are under construction), the city is taking measures to pass the technical barriers so that gas stoves can better play their role.

### 结合技术革新　大造煤气发生炉  无锡百余单位实现煤气化

    结合技术革新　大造煤气发生炉
    无锡百余单位实现煤气化
    新华社南京29日电　江苏省无锡市已经有一百多个单位在生产、生活方面实现了煤气化。
    这个市在技术革新和技术革命运动中大搞煤气化，经过半个月的突击，到3月18日止，全市建成的大小各式煤气发生炉达四百九十一座，其中75％已经启用。煤气的利用从烧锅炉发展到烧窑、熔料、锻打、化铁浇铸等方面，用煤量一般都比原来节省30％到50％。
    中共无锡市委把推广煤气发生炉作为全市各行各业大搞技术革命的重要内容之一，并由市委书记亲自领导这一工作，因而形成了大搞煤气发生炉的群众运动。申新、丽新等纺织厂职工只用七昼夜，就建成了二十一立方米和二十三立方米的大型煤气发生炉。采矿机械厂工人听到锻压厂利用煤气锻铁的消息以后，深夜派人到这个工厂“取经”，回厂以后立即组成一百多人的突击队，连夜砌成了两座锻铁用的煤气发生炉。北塘区群众在两天内，建成生活用煤气炉九十四座，使全区七十多家工厂和一些商店首先在生活中用上了煤气。
    无锡市在突击建造煤气炉中，认真贯彻自力更生和土洋并举的方针。南长区一个中心食堂在建造煤气炉中，用旧砖、破砖砌炉体，用破缸片锤成粉砂代替耐火泥修炉膛，只花了四元五角钱就建成了一座不用耐火砖、不用鼓风机、不用管道的煤气发生炉，用煤量比过去节省50％。各单位在大搞煤气化中，还发扬了共产主义的协作精神，做到一家有困难，大家帮助。维新漂染厂在焊接煤气管道时缺少氧气，勤生布厂职工听到以后就把厂内的氧气送去支援。锻压厂为帮助兄弟单位建炉，还派出四个熟练工人轮流到各厂进行指导，受到热烈欢迎，促进了建炉工作。
    现在，这个市一面积极建造新炉（正在施工的有三百二十三座），一面采取措施过好技术关，使煤气炉更好地发挥效益。
