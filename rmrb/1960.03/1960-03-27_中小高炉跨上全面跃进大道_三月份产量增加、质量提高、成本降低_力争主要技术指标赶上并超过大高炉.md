Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: The first spring of the 1960s sees small and medium-sized blast furnace production across the country presenting a vibrant and rapidly changing scene of comprehensive leap forward. Continuous and astonishing production news is emerging in terms of blast furnace utilization coefficient, pig iron cost, and quality. Some small blast furnaces have already taken the lead, with their main technical indicators catching up with or even surpassing those of large blast furnaces.

The rate of increase in the utilization coefficient (i.e., the tons of pig iron produced per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day) is extremely encouraging. This time last year, the national average utilization coefficient for small blast furnaces was only 0.56, and small blast furnaces with a utilization coefficient of 1 were rare. However, since the beginning of this year, more than a dozen small blast furnaces in Jinan, Weifang, Ma'anshan, and other places have achieved an average monthly utilization coefficient as high as 3 or more, creating an unprecedented miracle in China's iron smelting history; more than one hundred small blast furnaces have maintained an average monthly utilization coefficient of around 2, keeping pace with the most advanced large blast furnaces in the country. In February, the national average utilization coefficient for small and medium-sized blast furnaces has already broken through 1. This means that today, one blast furnace of the same size can produce as much as two blast furnaces in the same period last year. Anhui Province, which has continuously achieved large-scale high production, saw its small blast furnaces achieve an average utilization coefficient of 1.695 in February, surpassing the national level of large blast furnaces in the same month.

The pig iron cost of small and medium-sized blast furnaces in many regions is also decreasing significantly. In the past year, small blast furnace enterprises in more than a dozen provinces and regions across the country reduced pig iron costs by 40% to 50%. At present, Yunnan, Guizhou, and four special districts including Jin Southeast of Shanxi, Shaoyang and Xiangtan of Hunan, and Daxian of Sichuan, have achieved the state-stipulated standards for pig iron costs from small blast furnaces ahead of schedule. More than forty small blast furnace iron smelting enterprises have reduced the cost of each ton of pig iron to below 150 yuan, catching up with the level of large blast furnaces.

While achieving large-scale high production and significantly reducing costs, the quality of pig iron from small and medium-sized blast furnaces is also rapidly improving. For example, in February, the national pig iron qualification rate for small blast furnaces was about 75%, with Anhui and three other provinces reaching over 90%; this time last year, the pig iron qualification rate for small blast furnaces was only about 50%. More than a million farmers who started operating small blast furnaces more than a year ago have now become skilled workers capable of mastering small blast furnaces.

Small and medium-sized blast furnaces in various parts of China have grown up in less than two years. In such a short period, they have overcome numerous technical difficulties in production and embarked on the broad road of comprehensive leap forward. This is the result of the small and medium-sized blast furnace workers daring to carry out revolution and continuously engaging in revolution. Since last year, small blast furnace workers in various places have, through repeated experiments in production practice, created the iron smelting technology of "taking wind as the key and raw materials as the foundation" with high smelting intensity. For example, Changwei Special District in Shandong Province, in order to increase the air volume, raise the blast temperature of blast furnaces, and refine iron smelting raw materials, generally adopted methods such as connecting blowers in parallel and expanding the air inlets of blast furnaces, increasing the air volume used by blast furnaces by one to several times; they reformed the hot blast stoves and hot blast pipes of small blast furnaces, raising the blast temperature used by blast furnaces from 400 degrees Celsius to over 600 degrees Celsius; at the same time, they vigorously created artificial rich ore, increasing the iron content of ore from over 40% to over 50%. Through these efforts, more than 80 small blast furnaces in the entire special district have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest: the average utilization coefficient in February increased from 0.92 last year to 2.07, the pig iron qualification rate increased by 12% compared to last year, and the pig iron cost decreased by 40% compared to last year.

In order to comprehensively promote the iron smelting technology of "taking wind as the key and raw materials as the foundation" with high smelting intensity in small blast furnaces nationwide, and to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in high production, high quality, low consumption, and low cost, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently formulated a plan for the technical transformation of small blast furnaces nationwide based on the experience of advanced small blast furnaces in various places. This plan proposes that the main content of the technical transformation of small blast furnaces is: first, adopt large blowers or connect small blowers in parallel or in series, and take measures such as transforming air supply pipelines and expanding tuyeres to increase air volume and increase the smelting intensity of blast furnaces; second, take measures such as improving the structure of hot blast stoves, increasing the diameter of hot blast pipes, and increasing and improving dust removal equipment to increase blast temperature and reduce coke consumption; third, adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the raw material production system and the internal transportation system of the factory, and improve labor productivity; fourth, add equipment and adopt washing, selection, screening, and sintering methods to increase the iron content of the ore.

At present, the work of technical innovation and technical revolution in small blast furnaces has been widely launched across the country, and the vast number of workers in small and medium-sized iron smelting enterprises are carrying out a competition for a comprehensive leap forward in iron smelting production. Their ambition is to strive to catch up with and surpass large and medium-sized blast furnaces in terms of utilization coefficient, coking coal consumption, pig iron quality, and pig iron cost in the first year of the 1960s.

    中小高炉跨上全面跃进大道
    三月份产量增加、质量提高、成本降低
    力争主要技术指标赶上并超过大高炉
    新华社25日讯　六十年代的第一个春天，全国中小型高炉的生产，呈现出一派万紫千红、日新月异的全面跃进大好景象。高炉设备利用系数、生铁成本和质量方面，都不断传出惊人的生产喜讯，一部分小高炉已经捷足先登，主要技术指标赶上或超过了大高炉。
    利用系数（即每立米高炉容积一昼夜炼出的生铁吨数）提高的速度是十分令人振奋的。去年今天，全国小高炉的平均利用系数只有零点五六，利用系数达到一的小高炉可以说是凤毛麟角。但是今年以来，已经有济南、潍坊、马鞍山等地的十几座小高炉，月平均利用系数高达三以上，开创了我国炼铁史上前所未有的奇迹；有一百多座小高炉的月平均利用系数，保持在二左右，和全国最先进的几座大高炉并驾齐驱。2月份全国中小型高炉的平均利用系数，已经突破了一。这就是说，今天一座同样大小的高炉，能顶上去年同期的两座使用。连续获得大面积高产的安徽省，2月份小高炉的平均利用系数达到一点六九五，超过了同月全国大高炉的水平。
    许多地区中小型高炉的生铁成本，也正在大幅度地降低。去年一年，全国有十几个省、区的小高炉企业，把生铁成本降低了40％到50％。目前，全国已经有云南、贵州两个省和山西的晋东南、湖南的邵阳、湘潭、四川的达县等四个专区，小高炉的生铁成本提前达到了国家规定的标准，有四十多个小高炉炼铁企业，每吨生铁的成本降低到了一百五十元以下，赶上了大高炉的水平。
    在实现大面积高产和大幅度降低成本的同时，中小型高炉的生铁质量也在迅速提高。例如2月份全国小高炉的生铁合格率为75％左右，其中安徽等四个省为90％以上；而去年的今天，小高炉的生铁合格率只有50％左右。一年多以前开始在小高炉旁操作的农民，现在有上百万人成为驾驭小高炉的熟练工人了。
    我国各地的中小型高炉，是在不到两年的时间内成长起来的。在这样短短的时间内，就闯过了生产技术上的重重难关，大踏步地跨上了全面跃进的康庄大道，这是中小型高炉职工敢于进行革命和不断进行革命的结果。去年以来，各地小高炉职工，在生产实践中经过多次试验，创造了“以风为纲、以原料为基础”的高冶炼强度的炼铁技术。例如山东昌潍专区，为了增大风量、提高高炉风温和精制炼铁原料，普遍采用鼓风机并联和扩大高炉进风口等办法，把高炉使用的风量，增加了一倍到几倍；改革了小高炉的热风炉和热风管道，把高炉使用的风温由摄氏四百度提高到六百度以上；同时，大造人造富矿，把矿石含铁量从百分之四十几提高到百分之五十几。经过这些努力，全专区八十多座小高炉获得了全面丰收：2月份的平均利用系数由去年的零点九二提高到二点零七，生铁合格率比去年提高了12％，生铁成本比去年降低了40％。
    为了在全国小高炉上全面推行“以风为纲，以原料为基础”的高冶炼强度的炼铁技术，实现高产优质低耗和低成本的全面跃进，冶金工业部最近根据各地先进小高炉的经验，制订了对全国小高炉实行技术改造的方案。这个方案提出，小高炉技术改造的主要内容是：一，采用大鼓风机或小鼓风机并联、串联使用，并且改造送风管道、扩大风口等措施，加大风量，提高高炉的冶炼强度；二，采取改善热风炉结构、加大热风管管径，以及增加和改善除尘设备等措施，提高风温，降低焦炭的消耗量；三，采用土洋结合的办法，实现原料生产系统和厂内运输系统的机械化和半机械化，提高劳动生产率；四，增置设备，采用洗、选、筛分和烧结等办法，提高矿石的含铁量。
    目前，小高炉的技术革新和技术革命工作已经在全国广泛展开，中小型炼铁企业的广大职工，正在开展一个炼铁生产全面跃进的竞赛。他们的雄心壮志是：力争在六十年代的第一个年头，在利用系数、焦煤消耗、生铁质量和生铁成本方面，赶上并超过大中高炉。
