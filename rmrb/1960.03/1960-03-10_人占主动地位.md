Man should not passively be a slave to objective things. On the contrary, he should grasp the laws of objective things to promote the forward development of objective things. This is the basic view of Marxists on the relationship between the objective and the subjective. In January 1959, several mechanical accidents occurred continuously in the sintering workshop of our Mudanjiang Cement Plant. At this time, some people panicked. Some believed that it was "caused by insufficient maintenance of machinery by people," and others believed that "the life of the machinery has come to an end, and accidents are inevitable." Both of these views have limitations and are one-sided, and neither observes the problem comprehensively. The relationship between man and machine should be such that the former occupies a dominant position: it is man who uses the machine, not the machine that dominates man. Man should control and conquer the machine, grasp the objective laws of its movement, and not be subjectively arbitrary. If this is not the case, it is impossible to avoid accidents even if you stand in front of the machine all day, staring at it with your eyes and holding it with your hands. For example, Comrade Wang Xiliang of our factory greatly increased the output by simply adding a small iron plate to the "heater." What is the reason for this? This is precisely because Comrade Wang Xiliang has mastered the performance and laws of motion of the heater. Adding this small iron plate is exactly what the heater needs. It is precisely that people have utilized their subjective initiative based on the laws of motion of objective things, and promoted the development of production. Otherwise, even adding a large gold plate would not increase production.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our factory's production targets rose daily, and output exceeded the mechanical design capacity, increasing the mechanical load. This is like a person being able to carry one hundred pounds of weight on a hundred-meter journey. If you insist on starting from subjective wishes and asking him to carry two hundred pounds or more, it will undoubtedly shorten the distance he can travel. The physical strength of the person himself and the machinery will also be consumed more greatly and quickly. If you insist on desperately moving forward, you will gradually begin to experience back pain and leg soreness. Machinery and people both have this law of motion.

The main cause of accidents is still that subjective initiative is not adapted to the objective laws of motion, that is, the subjective has not fully grasped the laws of development of objective things. This is like what we usually say, that we have not taken effective and appropriate measures and methods based on objective needs. Therefore, only by mastering the laws of motion of objective things can we have correct methods and measures to promote the forward development of objective things.

Under the leadership of the Party committee, all the workers in our workshop debated these issues. Everyone can recognize that they should grasp the laws of development of objective things, and at the same time, they must give full play to people's subjective initiative, find a set of effective methods, and constantly solve contradictions, so that things can continue to develop. Blindly and one-sidedly understanding objective things will hinder and delay the development of things and will cause great damage to the work.

Our goal is to demand a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in production. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party committee, our workers from top to bottom actively implemented the "five-character magic formula" of touching, listening, checking, looking, and asking, advocated that old workers take the lead, and adopted the method of close integration of new and old workers to carry out mass movements, vigorously carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution, and more practically and extensively implemented the "two participations and one transformation," mobilized all positive factors, established a "medical team," and conducted a comprehensive overhaul of the machinery at the end of January, basically eliminating mechanical accidents, and the operating efficiency immediately increased from less than 90% to more than 98%, creating favorable conditions for the Great Leap Forward.

This is the achievement we have gained from studying Marxism-Leninism. Only by following the theory of Marxism-Leninism and using it as a guide to our thinking can we comprehensively grasp objective things, discover contradictions, constantly solve contradictions, and constantly achieve new victories and greater leaps forward.

    人占主动地位
    黑龙江牡丹江水泥厂工人　李长江
    人，不能消极的做客观事物的奴隶，相反，他应该掌握客观事物的规律去推动客观事物向前发展。这是马克思主义者对待客观和主观的关系的基本看法。我们牡丹江水泥厂烧成车间，在1959年1月份，连续发生几次机械事故。在这个时候，有些人恐慌起来，有的认为是“人对机械维护的不够所造成的”，也有的认为是“机械寿命到头了，事故是不可避免的”。这两种看法都有局限性和片面性，都没有全面地去观察问题。人和机械的关系，应该说前者占主动地位：是人运用机械，而不是机械支配人。人应该控制、征服机械，掌握它运动的客观规律性，不能主观地随心所欲。如果不是这样，就是你成天站在机械前用眼睛盯着它，用手把着它，也不可能不出事故。比如，我厂王喜良同志只用一块小小的铁板加在“加热机”上，产量就大大的提高了。这是什么道理呢？这正是由于王喜良同志掌握了加热机的性能和运动规律，加上这块小铁板，正好适合于加热机的需要，正是人依据客观事物运动的规律，发挥了主观能动作用，推动了生产的发展。否则，就是加上一个大金板也不会提高产量的。
    我厂在大跃进的1958年，生产指标逐日上升，产量超过机械设计能力，增加了机械的负荷量，这像一个人走一百米路能扛一百斤的重量，而你硬要从主观愿望出发，叫他扛二百斤或更多一些，无疑就要缩短他所进行的路程，人本身的体力和机械也就消耗的大和快，假如硬要拼命再往前走，就会逐渐的开始腰疼、腿酸，机械和人都有这种运动的规律。
    事故的主要原因还是由于主观能动性适应客观事物运动规律性不够，也就是主观上没有充分掌握客观事物的发展规律。这就像我们平常所说的那样，没有根据客观的需要，采取有效的、适当的措施和办法。所以，只有掌握客观事物运动的规律才能有正确的方法和措施，推动客观事物向前发展。
    我们车间的全体职工，在党委的领导下，辩论了这些问题，大家都能认识到应该掌握住客观事物发展规律，同时又必须发挥人的主观能动性，找出一套有效的办法，不断解决矛盾，才能使事物不断发展。盲目地、片面地去认识客观事物，都会阻碍和延缓事物的发展，会给工作招来了极大的损害。
    我们的目的是要求在生产上来个更大、更好、更全面的跃进。因此，我们工人在党委的领导下，从上到下、积极贯彻执行了摸、听、查、看、问的“五字妙诀”，提倡老工人上马，新老工人密切结合大搞群众运动的办法，大搞技术革命和文化革命，更切实、更广泛地执行了“两参一改”，调动了一切积极因素，成立了“医疗队”，在1月末对机械进行了一次全面检修，基本上消灭了机械事故，运转效率立即由不足90％提高到98％以上，为大跃进创造了良好的条件。
    这就是我们学习马克思列宁主义获得的成绩。我们工人只有遵循马克思列宁主义理论，以它作为指导思想的指南，才会全面地掌握客观事物，发现矛盾，不断解决矛盾，不断地取得新胜利和更大的跃进。
