Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The China-Africa Solidarity Committee today issued a statement regarding support for Algeria Day. The full text is as follows:

The China-Africa Solidarity Committee warmly responds to the call of the Africa-Asia Solidarity Council to hold "Algeria Day" on March 30th, firmly supports the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation, and extends the most sublime respect to the Algerian brothers standing at the forefront of the opposition to imperialism and colonialism.

In the long-term armed struggle against colonialism and for national independence, the Algerian people have developed into a strong force. Recently, the Algerian National Liberation Army successfully crushed the French invading army's so-called "Challe Plan," achieving a series of new victories and dealing a heavy blow to the French invading army. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has set a brilliant example for the African people, greatly encouraging the will of the African people to fight for independence and freedom. At the same time, it has been supported and admired by the Asian and African people and peace-loving and justice-seeking people all over the world.

In order to save its dying fate, French colonialists continue to carry out bloody massacres and political deception conspiracies in Algeria. Due to the defeat on the battlefield, De Gaulle was forced to recognize Algeria's right to self-determination, but he stubbornly rejected the conditions and guarantees proposed by the Algerian Provisional Government for negotiating the implementation of self-determination. After these conspiracies and tricks failed, De Gaulle frantically clamored that "military actions in Algeria must continue," and "a French military victory is the only answer to the Algerian war"; "France must remain in Algeria." This has further exposed the hideous features of the French colonialists. It is particularly worth noting that American imperialism, pretending to sympathize with the African people's demands for independence, has been supporting French imperialism in Algeria's colonial war with large amounts of military supplies and loans, actively attempting to intervene in Algeria. The people of the world admire the Algerian people for once again thwarting the conspiracy of the De Gaulle government. In the face of the staunchly fighting Algerian people, both French colonialists and American imperialists will suffer a miserable defeat.

The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Algerian people and the African people in their struggle against colonialism and for national independence. On March 24 this year, the "Support the Second Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Conference Day" rally held in our capital once again announced to the world: The Chinese people will always stand with the Algerian people and the African people in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and for national independence, supporting and encouraging each other. We warmly welcome the resolution on the Algerian issue of the Second All-African People's Conference, and we hope that the upcoming Second Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Conference will also make more resolute support for the Algerian people's struggle. We firmly believe that with the support of the Asian and African people and the world's peaceful and progressive forces, the Algerian people will unite as one and carry the national liberation war to the end. The heroic Algerian people will ultimately achieve final victory in the struggle against colonialism and for national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to Mahjoub, Secretary of the General Union of Algerian Workers, on the occasion of the Asia-Africa people's "Algeria Day," on behalf of the Chinese workers, expressing the most sublime respect and firm support for the Algerian workers and people's heroic struggle and indomitable will to fight for national independence.

The telegram stated, "The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has powerfully struck at the French colonialists supported by American imperialism, setting a good example for the people of African countries in their struggle for national independence and democratic freedom. We firmly believe that as long as we strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, the Algerian people, with the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world, will surely achieve final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China said today in a telegram to Algerian women that the Algerian people's unremitting struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the French aggressors, and the path adhered to by the Algerian people is a glorious example of the African people's national liberation movement.

The All-China Women's Federation's telegram was sent to the Algerian Red Crescent Society and the Algerian Women's Union in support of "Algeria Day." The telegram said: "At the time when the Asian and African people are holding "Algeria Day", hundreds of millions of Chinese women express to you and through you to the Algerian sisters our firm support for the just struggle of the Algerian brothers and sisters, and are willing to unite with you to fight together for the elimination of imperialism and colonialism." The telegram pointed out that the Algerian people and women have become stronger as they fight in the armed struggle against the French colonialists, showing unparalleled perseverance and heroism. The telegram said: "We firmly believe that the strong struggle of the Algerian people and the African people united as one, with the firm support of just people all over the world, will surely achieve new and greater victories."

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today jointly sent a telegram to the Youth and Sports Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front and the General Union of Algerian Muslim Students, representing all Chinese youth and students, extending combat salutations to the Algerian people and young students who are fighting heroically on the occasion of "Algeria Day."

The telegram said: "The Algerian people are adhering to the armed struggle for independence and freedom, and they are becoming stronger as they fight, constantly dealing heavy blows to the French colonialists and the imperialist camp headed by the United States. The Algerian people's struggle has powerfully encouraged and supported the struggle of the entire African people for national independence. Chinese youth and students greatly admire and firmly support your just struggle, and firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the strong and unyielding Algerian people."

    我亚非团结委员会发表支持阿尔及利亚日的声明
    最后胜利必属阿尔及利亚人民
    全总、妇联、青联和学联致电支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争
    新华社29日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表了关于支持阿尔及利亚日的声明，全文如下：
    中国亚非团结委员会热烈响应亚非团结理事会关于在3月30日举行“阿尔及利亚日”的号召，坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争，并向站在反对帝国主义与殖民主义最前列的阿尔及利亚弟兄们致最崇高的敬意。
    阿尔及利亚人民在长期反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的武装斗争中，已经锻炼成一支坚强的力量，最近期间，阿尔及利亚民族解放军更成功地粉碎了法国侵略军的所谓“夏耳计划”，取得了一系列新的胜利，给予法国侵略军以沉重的打击。阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，已在非洲人民中树立了光辉的榜样，大大鼓舞了非洲人民为独立自由而斗争的意志，同时，也受到了亚非人民和全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的支持和敬佩。
    法国殖民主义者为了挽救其垂死的命运，还继续在阿尔及利亚进行血腥屠杀和玩弄政治欺骗的阴谋。由于在战场上失利，戴高乐被迫承认阿尔及利亚的自决权利，但他却顽固地拒绝了阿尔及利亚临时政府提出谈判实施自决的条件和保证。戴高乐在玩弄这些阴谋诡计不能得逞之后，更疯狂叫嚣“阿尔及利亚军事行动必须继续下去”，“法国以武力取胜是对阿尔及利亚战争的唯一答案”；“法国必须留在阿尔及利亚”。这就更彻底暴露了法国殖民主义者的狰狞面目。特别值得注意的，伪装同情非洲人民独立要求的美帝国主义，一直以大量军火和贷款支援法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，积极企图插手于阿尔及利亚。全世界人民都钦佩阿尔及利亚人民又一次粉碎了戴高乐政府的阴谋。在坚强战斗的阿尔及利亚人民面前，法国殖民主义者和美国帝国主义者都将遭到惨败。
    中国人民一贯坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。今年3月24日，在我国首都举行的“支持第二届亚非人民团结大会日”的大会再一次向全世界宣布：中国人民将永远与阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和争取与维护民族独立的斗争中团结在一起，互相支援，互相鼓舞。我们热烈欢迎第二届全非人民大会关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议，我们期望即将召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会也将作出对阿尔及利亚人民的斗争更坚决的支持。我们深信，在亚非人民和全世界和平、进步力量的支持下，阿尔及利亚人民必将团结一致，把民族解放战争进行到底。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争中终将获得最后的胜利。
    新华社29日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一今天致电阿尔及利亚工人总联合会书记马舒，在亚非人民举行“阿尔及利亚日”之际，代表中国工人对阿尔及利亚工人和人民争取民族独立的英勇斗争和顽强意志表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。
    电报说，“阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争有力地打击了在美帝国主义支持下的法国殖民主义者，为非洲各国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争树立了良好的榜样。我们深信：只要加强团结、坚持斗争，阿尔及利亚人民在全世界各国人民的同情和支持下，必将获得最后胜利”。
    新华社29日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天在致阿尔及利亚妇女的一份电报中说，阿尔及利亚人民坚持不懈的斗争，给了法国侵略者以沉重的打击，阿尔及利亚人民所坚持的道路，是非洲人民民族解放运动的光辉榜样。
    全国妇联的电报是为支持“阿尔及利亚日”而发给阿尔及利亚红新月会和阿尔及利亚妇女联盟的。电报说：“在亚非人民举行‘阿尔及利亚日’的时候，亿万中国妇女向你们并通过你们向阿尔及利亚的姊妹们表示我们坚决支持阿尔及利亚兄弟姊妹们的正义斗争，愿和你们团结起来为消灭帝国主义和殖民主义而共同奋斗。”电报指出，阿尔及利亚人民和妇女在抗击法国殖民者的武装斗争中，越战越强，表现了无比坚毅的英雄气概。电报说：“我们坚信，阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民团结一致的强大斗争，在全世界正义的人们的坚决支持下，必将取得新的、更大的胜利。”
    新华社29日讯　中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会今天联名致电阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线青年及体育委员会和阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生总会，代表全中国青年和学生在举行“阿尔及利亚日”之际，向正在英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民和青年学生致战斗的敬礼。
    电报说：“阿尔及利亚人民坚持着争取独立和自由的武装斗争，并且愈战愈强，不断给予法国殖民主义者和以美国为首的帝国主义阵营以沉重的打击。阿尔及利亚人民的斗争有力地鼓舞和支持了整个非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争。中国青年和学生十分敬佩和坚决支持你们的正义斗争，并深信最后胜利一定属于坚强不屈的阿尔及利亚人民。”
