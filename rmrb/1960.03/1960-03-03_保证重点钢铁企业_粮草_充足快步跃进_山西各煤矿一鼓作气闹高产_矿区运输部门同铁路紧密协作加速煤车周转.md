To ensure key iron and steel enterprises have sufficient "supplies" and can leap forward rapidly, a mass movement of "using coal to guarantee steel" is vigorously unfolding in the state-owned coal mine system of Shanxi Province. This movement has pushed coal mine production to a new peak. On the first day of the movement, the daily output of state-owned coal mines across the province increased by more than 40,000 tons compared to the past.

The state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province are responsible for supplying coal to many key industrial enterprises across the country. A large portion of the industrial coal and coking coal used by iron and steel enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation, Shanghai's iron and steel plants, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company are supplied by state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province. The production situation of state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province is directly related to the production of the national iron and steel industry. In order to ensure that iron and steel enterprises have sufficient "supplies" and promote better leaps forward in steel production, after Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company proposed to workers on the national iron and steel front to carry out a competition to complete the first quarter plan ahead of schedule, the Shanxi Provincial Coal Mine Administration quickly held a telephone conference to mobilize coal mine workers across the province to increase coal production with full effort. A massive mass-based coal seizing movement was quickly launched in state-owned coal mines throughout the province.

The Fenshi Mining Bureau established a high-yield command headquarters. The Party Secretary, Bureau Director, engineers, and office staff went deep underground to work alongside the workers and implemented "four guarantees" (guarantee ideology, guarantee output, guarantee attendance, guarantee safety) for the coal mining faces. Leading cadres of Datong, Yangquan, Xishan, and Lu'an Mining Bureaus were assigned to take charge of various coal mining faces. These measures effectively promoted the development of the movement. The Xishan Mining Bureau, which mainly produces coking coal, launched the "Dragon Race Dragon" movement (forming a production chain from drilling, blasting, supporting, moving the flume, dropping coal, loading coal to transporting coal within a coal mining team). Initially, only four dragons, the previously outstanding Red Flag Coal Mining Team, Victory Coal Mining Team, July 1st Coal Mining Team, and May 1st Coal Mining Team, participated in the competition. After the encouragement and promotion by leading cadres and office staff, coal mining teams, auxiliary workers, and office staff organized racing dragons one after another. Within two or three days, 120 dragons were formed in the entire bureau. The dragons competed with each other not only in output but also in efficiency, which quickly increased the daily output of coal in the entire bureau from more than 11,000 tons to more than 16,700 tons, reaching a maximum of more than 22,000 tons, creating the highest historical record of output for Xishan Mining Bureau. The Datong Mining Bureau launched a "10,000 pace-setter" competition. Workers, in order to become pace-setters in the glorious task of seizing coal to guarantee steel, increased production with all their strength. Without adding any equipment, they produced more than 11,000 tons of coal per day than before.

While the workers of state-owned coal mines throughout the province launched the coal seizing competition to guarantee steel, the transportation system of coal mine areas in Shanxi Province and the Taiyuan Railway Bureau jointly launched a transportation competition movement to "guarantee coal for iron and steel." The transportation departments of the Yangquan Mining Bureau and the railway competed with each other, accelerating loading and unloading, shortening the time cars stayed in the mining area from 12 hours to 9 hours. Loading and unloading workers of the Fenshi Mining Bureau launched a "clever loading" competition, allowing each freight car to load more than 5 tons of coal. In the "no coal landing" movement, the Xishan Mining Bureau and the Yangquan Mining Bureau built many automatic simple coal bunkers, greatly reducing loading and unloading time and accelerating car turnover. Driven by the competition, the coal needed by factories such as Wuhan Iron and Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel, Shijingshan Iron and Steel, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel were all delivered promptly and in full by the various coal mines in Shanxi, and some places even exceeded the original planned needs.

    保证重点钢铁企业“粮草”充足快步跃进
    山西各煤矿一鼓作气闹高产
    矿区运输部门同铁路紧密协作加速煤车周转
    本报太原2日电　一个“以煤保钢”的群众运动在山西省国营煤矿系统蓬勃展开。这个运动把煤矿生产推向了一个新的高峰。运动开展的第一天，全省国营煤矿的日产量就比过去增加四万多吨。
    山西省国营煤矿负责供应全国许多重点工业企业的用煤。武汉钢铁公司、重庆钢铁公司、上海各钢铁厂、石景山钢铁公司、包头钢铁公司和太原钢铁公司等钢铁企业的工业用煤和炼焦煤，很大一部分都由山西省国营煤矿供应。山西省国营煤矿生产情况好坏，直接关系到全国钢铁工业的生产。为了保证钢铁企业有充足的“粮草”，促进钢铁生产更好地跃进，在石景山钢铁公司向全国钢铁战线职工倡议开展提前完成首季计划的竞赛以后，山西省煤矿管理局很快召开了电话会议，动员全省煤矿职工鼓足干劲增产煤炭。声势浩大的群众性的夺煤运动随即在全省各国营煤矿迅速展开。
    汾西矿务局成立了高产指挥部，党委书记、局长、工程师和科室人员都深入井下，同工人一起劳动，并对采煤工作面实行“四包”（包思想、包产量、包出勤、包安全）；大同、阳泉、西山、潞安等矿务局的领导干部，分工负责抓各个采煤工作面，这都有力地推动了运动的开展。以产主焦煤为主的西山矿务局开展了“龙赛龙”运动（按打眼、放炮、支柱、移溜子、落煤、装煤到运煤一个采煤队的生产顺序，组成一条龙）。开始只有原来比较优秀的红旗采煤队和胜利采煤队，七一采煤队和五一采煤队四条龙竞赛。经过领导干部和科室人员的鼓舞推动，采煤队、辅助工人、科室人员纷纷组织竞赛龙，两三天内，全局组成了一百二十条龙。龙与龙之间既赛产量，又赛效率，促使全局煤的日产量由一万一千多吨很快地提高到一万六千七百多吨，最高的达到两万二千多吨，创造了西山矿务局产量历史最高纪录。大同矿务局发动了“万人标兵”赛，职工们为了在完成夺煤保钢这个光荣的任务中当上标兵，一鼓作气地提高生产。他们没有增加任何设备，每天比原来多生产出一万一千多吨煤。
    在全省国营煤矿职工展开夺煤保钢竞赛的同时，山西省各煤矿矿区的运输系统，和太原铁路局联合展开了“保证钢铁用煤”的运输竞赛运动。阳泉矿务局运输部门和铁路互相挂钩竞赛，加快装卸，使车在矿区停留时间，由十二小时缩短到九小时。汾西矿务局装卸工人展开了“巧装车”竞赛，使每一个车皮多装五吨多煤。西山矿务局和阳泉矿务局在赛“煤不落地”运动中，修了许多自动简易煤仓，大大减少了装卸时间，加快了车的周转速度。由于竞赛的推动，武钢、重钢、石钢、太钢等厂需用的煤，山西各煤矿都百分之百地及时运到，有的地方还超过了原来需用的计划。
