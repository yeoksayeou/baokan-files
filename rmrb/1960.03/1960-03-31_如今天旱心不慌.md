    In the past, when it was dry, we panicked,
    We kowtowed and burned incense;
    Praying to the Heavens was useless,
    The crops in the fields withered and died in the drought.
    The peasants suffered, displaced and in distress!
    Now that it's dry, we don't panic,
    The commune members are living Dragon Kings;
    Thousands of canals and wells gush clear water,
    The crops in the fields ripple with green waves,
    The commune members sing ten thousand songs in praise of the Party!

    如今天旱心不慌
    从前天旱心发慌，
    又叩头来又烧香；
    祷告老天天不灵，
    田中禾苗旱死光。
    庄稼人，流离失所苦难当！
    如今天旱心不慌，
    社员就是活龙王；
    千渠万井吐清水，
    田中禾苗翻碧浪，
    社员们，高歌万曲赞颂党！
