    Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Teaching and Leveraging the Role of Production Bases:
    Significant Improvement in Educational Quality at the Affiliated High School of Jilin Normal University

    (Our report) Jilin -- The Affiliated High School of Jilin Normal University adheres to putting politics in command, conscientiously implements the Party's education policy, continuously strengthens the Party's leadership over teaching, and fully leverages the role of production labor bases in teaching. In less than two years, the school's students have achieved all-round development in intellectual, moral, and physical education, and the quality of education has improved significantly. Last year, all 323 high school and junior high school graduates were admitted to higher education institutions and schools at the next level, with excellent examination results, ranking first in the province.

    Since the education revolution of 1958, the school's Party committee has conscientiously studied the Party's education policy, repeatedly launched teachers and students to deliberate and discuss major issues in teaching, and then made decisions for implementation. In order to ensure the Party's leadership over teaching, the school Party committee has, for the past two years, consistently adopted a system of leading cadres concurrently serving as grade-level directors and research group leaders, going deep into classes to understand students' learning situations, and going deep into teaching and research groups to understand teachers' teaching situations. The school's Party branch secretary, Party member principal, and director of teaching affairs, among other leading cadres, actively study teaching outlines and textbooks, read relevant teaching magazines, and actively learn professional knowledge from relevant teachers, preparing lessons together with teachers, helping teachers summarize teaching experience, and improve their professional level. With the specific help of the Party committee, all teachers are more proactively studying teaching work, constantly summarizing experience, and accelerating the improvement of teaching level.

    In order to implement the Party's education policy, the school Party committee, adhering to the principle of making do with whatever is available and relying on its own efforts, established at the beginning of last year a joint factory consisting of nine workshops, including machinery, electrical, chemical, metalworking, and woodworking, and a farm with 180 mu of land. To enable this production labor base to better serve teaching, the school established a production labor course, and set up a production labor teaching and research group, formulating teaching plans and compiling textbooks every semester. After production labor was listed as a formal course, teaching was closely integrated with production labor. Teachers of all subjects, based on a thorough understanding of the textbooks, tried to extract teaching materials directly related to production as the focus of teaching, and often used new achievements in production and scientific research to enrich the content of teaching materials, using examples related to production for explanation. Therefore, the quality of various teachings has also been significantly improved, and the academic performance of all students in all subjects is generally excellent, basically eliminating the phenomenon of failure.

    In improving the quality of education, the school Party committee has also particularly strengthened the teaching leadership of major basic courses such as Chinese, mathematics, and physics and chemistry. On the one hand, the Party committee strengthened political and ideological education for teachers teaching major basic courses, and on the other hand, organized school leaders to study the teaching outlines of these courses, and helped the teaching and research group study the teaching situation in previous years and the experience of improving teaching quality. The school Party committee regularly rotates teachers to Jilin University and Jilin Normal University for advanced studies, and hires experienced teachers from Jilin Normal University to teach concurrently, and organizes teachers to attend lectures and study. Therefore, the teaching quality of major basic courses has rapidly and significantly improved. Improving the teaching quality of major basic courses has also promoted the improvement of general basic courses such as history, geography, and biology.

    This year, this school is determined, on the basis of the achievements already made in the past, to continue to thoroughly implement the Party's education policy and further comprehensively improve the quality of education.

    加强党对教学领导　发挥生产基地作用
    吉林师大附中教育质量显著提高
    本报讯　吉林师范大学附属中学坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党的教育方针，不断加强党对教学的领导，充分发挥生产劳动基地对教学的作用，在不到两年的时间内，全校学生智育、德育和体育获得全面发展，教育质量显著提高。去年全校三百二十三名高中和初中毕业生全部考取高等院校和上一级学校，考试成绩优良，居全省首位。
    自1958年教育革命以来，学校党委认真学习了党的教育方针，对教学中的重大问题反复发动师生酝酿讨论，然后做出决定贯彻执行。学校党委为了保证党对教学的领导，两年来，一直采取领导干部兼年级主任、兼教研组组长等制度，深入班级，了解学生学习情况，深入教研组，了解教师教学情况。学校党总支书记、党员校长和教导主任等领导干部平时积极钻研教学大纲、教材，阅读有关教学杂志，并主动向有关教师学习业务知识，和教师共同备课，帮助教师总结教学经验，提高业务水平。全校教师在党委具体帮助下，则更加主动地钻研教学工作，不断总结经验，加速提高教学水平。
    学校党委为了贯彻执行党的教育方针，本着因陋就简，自力更生的原则，在去年年初即办起一所由机械、电机、化工、金工、木工等九个车间组成的联合工厂和一所有一百八十亩地的农场。为使这个生产劳动基地更好地为教学服务，学校设立了生产劳动课，成立了生产劳动教研组，每学期制定教学计划和编写教材。生产劳动列为正式课程后，教学与生产劳动紧密结合。各科教师在通览教材的基础上，尽量挖掘与生产有直接联系的教材，做为教学的重点，经常用生产和科学研究的新成就丰富教材内容，运用与生产有关的例题进行讲解。因此各种教学的质量也获得显著提高，全校学生各科学习成绩普遍优良，基本上消灭了不及格现象。
    学校党委在提高教育质量中，还特别加强了对语文、数学和理化等主要基础课程的教学领导。党委一面对教主要基础课的教师加强政治思想教育，一面组织学校领导干部学习这些课程的教学大纲，帮助教研组研究历年来教学情况和提高教学质量的经验。学校党委定期轮流组织教师去吉林大学和吉林师范大学进修，并聘请吉林师范大学有经验的教师兼课，组织教师随堂听讲学习。因此，主要基础课的教学质量迅速得到显著提高。提高了主要基础课的教学质量，也就促进了历史、地理、生物等一般基础课的提高。
    今年，这个学校决心在过去已经取得的成绩的基础上，继续深入贯彻党的教育方针，进一步全面提高教育质量。
