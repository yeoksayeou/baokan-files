    Increase Production and Practice Economy in Industrial Fabrics
    Cotton cloth is an important material for the economic life of the broad masses of people and an indispensable supply for industrial production. With the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the demand for industrial fabrics in various sectors of the national economy is also increasing. Therefore, making every effort to increase production and practice economy, on the one hand, vigorously increasing the production of industrial fabrics, and on the other hand, vigorously conserving industrial fabrics, is a matter that must be given sufficient attention by all sectors of the national economy.
    In recent years, the state has made great efforts to develop textile production using cotton as raw material, basically guaranteeing the need for industrial fabrics. However, under the new situation of rapid development in production, relying solely on cotton textiles is no longer sufficient to meet the needs. It is also necessary to find ways to expand the source of raw materials for industrial fabrics from various aspects. Industrial fabrics and public-use fabrics are not entirely the same as civilian fabrics in terms of usage. In addition to a portion that requires pure cotton cloth, many industrial and public-use fabrics can be widely replaced by various wild and miscellaneous fiber fabrics, such as Apocynum venetum, wild hemp, flax, flax waste, ramie velvet, and cotton stalk skins, all of which are good raw materials for producing industrial fabrics. Widely utilizing these wild fibers and miscellaneous fibers to develop the production of various industrial fabrics has particularly important practical significance in the current increase in industrial fabric production.
    Developing industrial fabric production using wild fibers and miscellaneous fibers has favorable conditions. First, we have abundant material resources. During last year's "small autumn harvest" campaign, commercial departments purchased a large amount of various wild and miscellaneous fibers, some of which can be used as raw materials for industrial fabrics. As long as we pay attention to the utilization of this batch of raw materials, we can increase the production of industrial fabrics. Second, under the new situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, some technical problems encountered in the spinning of wild and miscellaneous fibers can be completely or gradually solved through subjective efforts. Recently, some cotton textile factories and some indigenous textile factories in Shanghai, Sichuan, Qingdao and other places, with the strong support of the Party committees and the assistance of scientific research departments, boldly innovated and experimented with blending some wild and miscellaneous fibers with cotton and wool raw materials, and achieved initial results in weaving industrial fabrics. Although there are still some problems in product quality and cost, these problems will be solved sooner or later. Third, in terms of organizational leadership, various localities are establishing specialized agencies and strengthening this work in a planned way. The above situation tells people that the full utilization of wild fibers and various miscellaneous fibers to produce industrial fabrics has great development prospects. In the past, wild and miscellaneous fibers could only be used to make coarse ropes, but today's wild and miscellaneous fibers can already be woven into cloth. With the improvement and enhancement of technology, will it be possible to weave more cloths from more varieties of wild fibers and miscellaneous fibers in the future? Is it possible to use certain wild and miscellaneous fibers to weave higher-grade products? The answer is also affirmative. In fact, this has already been done in a few places. As long as we try every means to vigorously support the development of this emerging thing and adhere to the spirit of continuous revolution, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, the weaving of miscellaneous fibers will surely move to a new stage.
    Wild fibers and miscellaneous fibers are relatively complex in variety and have different characteristics from cotton fibers in terms of physical properties. Therefore, when utilizing these wild and miscellaneous fiber raw materials at present, we must pay attention to starting from specific conditions: we must consider the variety, quantity, and conditions of textile equipment of raw materials, and also consider the requirements of industrial departments in terms of use, specifications, etc. Textile equipment should be adapted to local conditions. Whenever machine spinning equipment can be used for production, machine spinning should be the main method as much as possible. Fibers that do not have machine spinning equipment or cannot be used for machine spinning equipment should be used in indigenous spinning equipment. Commercial departments must also pay attention to continuously organizing the collection of wild fibers and further strengthen the purchase, transfer, and transportation of various wild and miscellaneous fibers in order to fully utilize wild and miscellaneous fibers and increase the production of more industrial fabrics.
    While increasing the production of industrial fabrics, we must also pay attention to saving industrial fabrics and public-use fabrics. Paying attention only to saving without making efforts to increase production cannot fundamentally meet the needs. However, if we see that the production of industrial fabrics has increased and neglect to save, it will cause waste and will not achieve the goal of meeting the needs. Cloth is a frequently used consumer product, and the potential for savings is great. For example, making the same work clothes, if we pay attention to cutting and nesting techniques, we can improve the utilization rate of cotton cloth; mending broken work clothes can extend their service life; packaging fabrics for many products can also be replaced with substitutes; for products that must use cloth, we can also save cloth by improving packaging specifications and paying attention to recycling and reuse; some tarpaulins, farmland water conservancy fabrics, exhibition fabrics, and festive banner fabrics can completely avoid using pure cotton cloth and instead use fabrics or substitutes woven from other wild and miscellaneous fibers; as for other non-productive fabrics such as curtains, tablecloths, and sofa covers, we can save even more.
    Saving all the cloth that can be saved and using it where it is most needed is not only of economic significance but also of extremely important political significance. Practicing strict economy, opposing waste, and building the country through diligence and frugality is an important principle for building socialism at high speed. Since the founding of the country, after the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952 and the increase production and practice economy movement in 1955, good results have been achieved in building socialism and developing the national economy. Practicing strict economy and opposing waste have formed a trend in various sectors of the national economy. But this does not mean that practicing strict economy has been done thoroughly, or even that there is no need to practice strict economy and oppose waste. Chairman Mao explicitly pointed out in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The economy movement must be carried out thoroughly and persistently." This valuable instruction is of particular practical significance in the current new situation of rapid development in the national economy. All sectors of the national economy must better promote the spirit of diligence and frugality, take effective measures, plug all loopholes of waste, and make better achievements in saving industrial fabrics and public-use fabrics, as well as other materials.

### 为工业用布开源节流

    为工业用布开源节流
    棉布，是广大人民经济生活当中的重要物资，也是工业生产上不可缺少的用品。工农业生产的继续跃进，国民经济各部门对工业用布的需要量也愈来愈大，因此，千方百计开源节流，一方面大力增产工业用布，同时又大力节约工业用布，这是当前国民经济各部门必须足够重视的事情。
    近几年来，国家在发展以棉花做原料的纺织生产上做了很大的努力，基本上保证了工业用布的需要。但是，在生产飞跃发展的新形势下，单靠棉纺布匹已经不能完全适应需要了，还必须从多方面想办法开辟工业用布的原料来源。工业用布、公共用布在用途上和民用布不完全一样，其中除了一部分需用纯棉布以外，还有许多工业和公共用布可以广泛地利用各种野生和杂质纤维织品来代替，例如罗布麻、野麻、胡麻、亚麻下脚、苎麻绒及棉秆皮等，都是生产工业用布的很好原料。广泛地利用这些野生纤维和杂质纤维发展各种工业用布的生产，这在当前增产工业用布上具有特别重要的现实意义。
    利用野生纤维和杂质纤维发展工业用布生产具有良好的条件。首先，我们有着丰富的物质资源。商业部门在去年“小秋收”运动中收购了大量的各种野生和杂质纤维，其中有好些可以作为工业用布的原料，只要我们重视这批原料的利用，就可以增加工业用布的生产。其次，在技术革新和技术革命运动的新形势下，野生和杂质纤维的纺织上遇到的一些技术问题，经过主观努力，也是完全可以得到解决或者可以逐步得到解决的。最近，上海、四川、青岛等地有些棉纺织厂以及一些土纺织厂的职工在党委的大力支持和科学研究部门的协助下，大胆革新，试验把一些野生和杂质纤维与棉、毛原料混纺，就取得了初步成绩，织出了工业用布。尽管在产品质量上、成本上还存在着一些问题，但是这些问题迟早总是要得到解决的。其三，在组织领导上，各地正在建立专门的机构，有计划地加强这方面的工作。上述情况告诉人们，充分利用野生纤维和各种杂质纤维生产工业用布是大有发展前途的。过去的野生和杂质纤维只能用来制造粗大的绳索，今天的野生和杂质纤维，已经可以织成布了。随着技术的改进和提高，将来能不能用更多品种的野生纤维和杂质纤维织出更多的布匹呢？能不能利用某些野生和杂质纤维织成较高级产品呢？回答也是肯定的，事实上，在少数地方已经做到了。只要想尽一切办法，大力支持这一新生事物的发展，并且坚持不断革命的精神，大搞技术革新和技术革命，杂质纤维的织布事业就一定能够走向一个新的阶段。
    野生纤维和杂质纤维种类比较复杂，在物理性能上和棉纤维具有不同的特点，因此，在当前利用这些野生和杂质纤维原料的时候必须注意从具体条件出发：既要考虑原材料品种、数量和纺织设备的条件，还要考虑工业部门在用途、规格等方面的要求。纺织设备要因地制宜。凡是可以用机纺设备生产的，尽可能以机纺为主，没有机纺设备或不能用于机纺设备的纤维，就应当利用土纺设备。商业部门还必须注意不断地组织野生纤维的采集工作，并且进一步加强对各种野生和杂质纤维的收购和调运工作，以便充分地把野生和杂质纤维利用起来，增产更多的工业用布。
    在增产工业用布的同时，还必须注意节约工业用布和公共用布。只注意节约而不努力增产，固然不能从根本上满足需要，但是如果看到工业用布增加了，就忽视了节约，那就要造成浪费，同样达不到满足需要的目的。布匹是一种经常大量的消费品，节约的潜力很大。例如，做同样一件工作服，如果注意裁剪排料技术，就可以提高棉布的使用率；破了的工作服再缝补一下，就可以延长使用期限；有许多产品的包装用布也可以寻找代用品代替；对于必须用布的产品，还可以从改进包装规格、注意回收回用等方面节约用布；有些苫盖用布、农田水利用布、展览会、节日标语等用布就完全可以不用纯棉布而改用其它野生和杂质纤维织成的布或代用品；至于其它非生产性用布如窗帘、台布、沙发套等用布，更可大大节约。
    把一切可以节省的布都节省下来，用到最需要的地方去，这不仅仅具有经济意义，而且具有十分重要的政治意义。厉行节约，反对浪费，勤俭建国，这是高速度建设社会主义的一个重要的方针。建国以来，经过1952年的“三反”运动和1955年的增产节约运动，对建设社会主义和发展国民经济发生了良好的效果，厉行节约，反对浪费，在国民经济各部门已经形成了风气。但这并不等于厉行节约已经做得很彻底了，甚至不需要厉行节约，反对浪费了。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话中就明确指出：“节约运动必须彻底地持久地进行。”这一宝贵的指示在当前国民经济飞跃发展的新形势下尤其具有现实意义。一切国民经济部门必须更好地发扬勤俭节约的精神，采取有效措施，堵塞一切浪费的漏洞，在节约工业用布和公共用布以及其它物资方面，做出更好的成绩来。
