    Delegates to the Latin American Conference for Peace Believe
    Supporting the Cuban People Means Defending Peace
    Latin America's Struggle for Peace Should Start from Liberation Movements
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 9th. The Latin American Conference for Peace opened in Havana this morning. Participating in the conference were delegations of peace advocates from Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, as well as well-known figures from the Latin American cultural circles.
    Dr. Marta Frayde, President of the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and National Sovereignty, said in her opening speech that the conference was convened on the initiative of the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and National Sovereignty, and the conference will study the common issues of defending national sovereignty, developing the economy independently, and other issues of concern to the peoples of Latin American countries.
    Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, emphasized in his speech that the Latin American struggle for peace should start from the strong liberation movement of the Latin American people and serve this movement, which is guided by the overall interests of world peace. The struggle for sovereignty is the primary task of Latin American peace advocates.
    Marinello said that the aggressive plans against the Cuban Revolution, which are being stepped up by U.S. imperialism, are also an attack on the sovereignty and freedom of other Latin American peoples and the people of the world. He said that the highest contribution of this conference to the cause of peace will be to strengthen the support of the Latin American people for Cuba in defeating the common enemy.
    Marinello said that international tensions have eased somewhat, but dangers still exist. He said that the central task of stopping war is to launch a worldwide struggle for universal and complete disarmament. This disarmament is not like the partial disarmament proposed by the presidents of Chile and Peru, where only small countries disarm while the United States is not involved.
    He also suggested that the conference study convening an all-Latin American conference with the participation of all Latin American peace organizations, which is a wish repeatedly expressed by some countries. This conference should study issues such as sovereignty, freedom, economic underdevelopment, the people's education and culture, land reform, and expanding trade relations with all countries.
    Representatives of other countries attending the conference expressed their agreement with the proposals already put forward at the meeting when they delivered congratulatory speeches to the conference. They emphasized that the people of all countries support the heroic Cuban people and expressed their strong opposition to U.S. intervention. Chilean representative Walter Atia pointed out that the reaction of the people of South American countries to Eisenhower's visit was a cold reception for him, but enthusiastic support for Cuba.
    Eve Farge, Vice Chairman of the French National Peace Council and a member of the World Peace Council, who was invited to attend the conference, spoke at the meeting to pay tribute to the Cuban people who defeated U.S. imperialism and established a fortress of peace in this region of the world. Tishikvaze, Director of the Law Department of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and a member of the World Peace Council, said that the Soviet people admired the great victory of the Cuban people. He said that the World Peace Council will fully support the Cuban Revolution.

    拉丁美洲争取和平会议与会代表认为
    支援古巴人民就是保卫和平
    拉丁美洲的和平斗争应从解放运动出发
    新华社哈瓦那9日电拉丁美洲争取和平会议今天上午在哈瓦那开幕。参加会议的有阿根廷、巴西、古巴、智利、墨西哥、委内瑞拉、波多黎各的和平拥护者的代表团以及拉丁美洲文化界的知名人士。
    古巴保卫和平和各国人民主权运动理事会主席玛塔·弗赖德博士在致开幕词时说，这次会议是根据古巴保卫和平和各国人民主权运动理事会的倡议召开的，会议将研究保卫国家主权、独立发展经济以及拉丁美洲各国人民的其他共同问题。
    古巴人民社会党主席马里内略在发言时强调说，拉丁美洲的和平斗争应该从拉丁美洲人民强大的解放运动出发，并且为这个以世界和平的总的利益为指南的运动服务。争取主权的斗争是拉丁美洲和平拥护者的首要任务。
    马里内略说，美帝国主义加紧推行的反对古巴革命的侵略计划也是对其他拉丁美洲人民和世界人民主权和自由的进攻。他说，这次会议对和平事业的最崇高的贡献，将是加强拉丁美洲人民为击败共同敌人而对古巴进行的支援。
    马里内略说，国际紧张局势已经有所缓和，但是还存在着危险。他说，制止战争的中心任务是展开世界规模的争取普遍和全面裁军的斗争。这种裁军不是像智利和秘鲁总统所建议的那样，只有弱小国家裁军而不涉及到美国的那种局部裁军。
    他还建议会议研究召开有所有拉丁美洲和平组织参加的全拉丁美洲的会议，召开这样的会议是一些国家多次表明的愿望。这次会议应该研究主权、自由、经济不发达、人民的教育和文化、土地改革以及扩大同所有国家的贸易关系等问题。
    参加会议的其他国家的代表在向会议致祝词时，表示同意已经在会上提出的主张。他们强调指出各国人民支持英勇的古巴人民，并且表达了他们强烈地反对美国干涉的深切情感。智利代表华尔特·阿蒂亚指出，南美各国人民对艾森豪威尔访问的反应，是冷淡地接待他，而热烈地支持古巴。
    应邀出席会议的法国全国和平理事会副主席、世界和平理事会理事伊夫·法奇夫人在会上发言，向战胜美帝国主义并在世界的这个地区建立了和平堡垒的古巴人民致敬。苏联科学院法学部主任、世界和平理事会理事奇希克瓦泽说，苏联人民对古巴人民的巨大胜利感到钦佩。他说，世界和平理事会将全力支持古巴革命。
