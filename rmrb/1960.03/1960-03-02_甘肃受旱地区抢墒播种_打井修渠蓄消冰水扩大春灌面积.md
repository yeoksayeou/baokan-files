Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Electric Dispatch: People's communes throughout Gansu Province are comprehensively launching spring plowing and sowing work. In the warmer Longxi area, early spring crops such as potatoes and buckwheat are being sown. Cotton sowing has already begun on the banks of the Bailong River.

The people's communes in the central and western regions, which are experiencing drought, have launched activities to seize every minute and second to rush to plant while preserving soil moisture. In Dingxi Prefecture, the most drought-stricken area in the province, party committee secretaries at all levels are taking the lead, adopting methods of planting first on the sunny slopes and then on the shady slopes, first on dry land and then on irrigated land, watering one piece of land and planting one piece, and in a short period of time, more than 150,000 mu of summer crops such as wheat, barley, and highland barley have been sown. According to the local conditions of many mountains and few rivers, frequent droughts and little rainfall, Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County also adopted drought-resistant methods such as spring wheat vernalization and germination sowing, intercropping, digging nests and watering for spot sowing, opening ditches, sprinkling water, mixing fertilizer, and sowing, deep plowing and shallow burial in order to ensure planting and achieve high yields.

In the spring plowing production, all localities also focus on high-yield plots and experimental fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Electric Dispatch: The spring irrigation and drought resistance movement in Gansu Province is rapidly advancing. From the Beginning of Spring on February 5th to February 20th, the spring irrigation area has increased tenfold compared with the same period last year.

In the large-scale spring irrigation movement, Gansu adheres to the principle of walking on two legs, on the one hand, actively building key backbone projects, on the other hand, vigorously developing groundwater. Pingliang Prefecture organized three teams of people to focus on water storage projects, rushed to complete the projects in the near future, and universally built temporary weirs to intercept and store melted ice water, and has currently stored a large amount of spring water; at the same time, it promoted the experience of Dongzhiyuan in drilling string wells, plum blossom wells, and row wells, and massively dug springs and wells, and installed high-lift water lifting machinery. Many wells, springs, and high-lift water lifting projects in the area have already demonstrated their effectiveness. While building large and medium-sized water storage projects, Tianshui Prefecture carried out activities to find water sources and dig groundwater, and more than 80,000 water sources have been found in the area.

In the spring irrigation, all localities also actively summarized and promoted the experience of economical water use. The Niyang People's Commune in Huicheng County piled temporary earth ridges on the wheat fields that were not ridged last winter, piling and irrigating at the same time, and removing them after irrigation, which not only does not affect the wheat, but also makes the water evenly irrigated.

    甘肃受旱地区抢墒播种
    打井修渠蓄消冰水扩大春灌面积
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省各地人民公社全面展开春耕春播工作。气候较暖的陇西地区，正在播种洋芋、荞麦等早春作物。白龙江畔已经开始播种棉花。
    出现旱象的中部和西部地区各人民公社都掀起了争分夺秒，抢墒播种的活动。全省最干旱的定西专区，由各级党委书记挂帅，采取了先阳山后阴山、先旱地后水地、浇一块种一块的办法，在短时间内，已播种小麦、大麦、青稞等夏收作物十五万多亩。天祝藏族自治县根据本地山多川少，旱象多、雨量少的情况，在播种时还采用小麦春化催芽播种、套种、挖窝灌水点种、开沟撒水拌肥播种、深耕浅埋等防旱抗旱办法，力争保种保出，高产多收。
    各地在春耕生产中，还大抓丰产方与试验田。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省春灌抗旱运动迅速推进。从2月5日立春到2月20日，春灌面积比去年同期增加十倍。
    在大规模的春灌运动中，甘肃各地坚持两条腿走路，一面积极兴建关键性的骨干工程，一面大力开发地下水。平凉专区组织三套人马抓蓄水工程，突击近期完工的工程，普遍修筑临时围堰拦蓄消冰水，目前已蓄了大量春水；同时推广董志塬打串井、梅花井和排井的经验，大量挖泉打井，安装高扬程提水机械。全区已有许多眼井、泉和高扬程提水工程发挥了效益。天水专区在修建大中型蓄水工程的同时，开展了找水源、挖地下水运动，全区已找出水源八万多处。
    各地在春灌中还积极总结和推广经济用水的经验。徽成县泥阳人民公社对去冬没打畦的麦田，都堆上临时的土埂，边堆边灌，灌后取掉，既不影响小麦，又使水灌得匀。
