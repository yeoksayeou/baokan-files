Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly issued an urgent notice requiring agricultural (animal husbandry) and commercial departments in all parts of the country to seize the opportunity and immediately launch a poultry spring hatching campaign among the masses.

The notice said that spring is the most suitable season for poultry hatching. Vigorously carrying out spring hatching will not only play a decisive role in completing this year's annual poultry raising plan, but also greatly increase the market supply of poultry eggs in the current year, which is of great significance for ensuring the completion of procurement tasks. Therefore, all localities should regard spring hatching as an urgent task in the current comprehensive development of animal husbandry production.

The notice said that areas that have not yet arranged poultry production should immediately implement poultry development targets to the communes and teams. The spring hatching of chicks should reach more than 70% of the annual hatching volume; People's communes should implement the principle of "walking on two legs," vigorously develop collective poultry farms, formulate poultry raising plans for communes and teams, and actively mobilize commune members' families to raise poultry, to achieve the goal of "one brood of chickens hatched per household."

In order to ensure the smooth progress of spring hatching, the notice requires all localities to immediately organize forces to go deep into the communes and teams for inspection and guidance; to sort out and repair incubation room equipment, repairing while incubating; communes and teams with insufficient technical personnel can use on-site internships or apprenticeship and other crash methods to quickly train and replenish personnel.

Regarding the solution of the seed egg problem, the notice requires that each commune and team propose the required amount according to the incubation plan, and try to adopt the method of eating less and hatching more to prepare sufficient seed eggs. Those who cannot solve the problem themselves should actively contact the commercial departments, which will be responsible for adjusting and supplying them. Incubation rooms can also cooperate with commune members by exchanging chicks for eggs and other methods to raise seed eggs for hatching. Incubation rooms with the conditions should also add brooding rooms to raise chicks for a few more days, and allocate some concentrated feed for feeding the chicks in the incubation room. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the prevention and control of chick diseases to improve the survival rate of chicks.

The notice finally requires all localities to seize the tool reform work of poultry farms and promptly summarize and promote advanced experience in this regard.

    抓紧春孵　发展家禽
    农业部商业部通知各地开展家禽春孵工作
    新华社2日讯　农业部和商业部最近联合发出紧急通知，要求全国各地的农业（畜牧）和商业部门抓紧时机，立即在群众中开展一个家禽春孵运动。
    通知说，春季是家禽孵化最适宜的季节，大力开展春孵，不但对完成今年全年养禽计划有着决定性的作用，而且可以大大增加当年的禽蛋上市量，对保证完成收购任务也有很大意义。因此，各地应当把春孵做为当前全面发展畜牧业生产中一项紧要工作。
    通知说，凡是尚未安排家禽生产的地区，应该立即将家禽发展指标落实到社、队，春季孵雏禽要求达到全年孵化量的70％以上；人民公社应当贯彻两条腿走路的方针，大力发展集体养禽场，订出社、队养禽计划，并积极发动社员家庭饲养家禽，实现“每户孵一窝鸡”的要求。
    为了保证做好春孵工作。通知要求各地立即组织力量深入社、队检查指导；整理和修补孵房设备，边修边孵；技术人员不足的社、队，可利用现场实习或带徒弟等速成办法迅速培训充实。
    关于解决种蛋的问题，通知要求，各社、队根据孵化计划提出需要量，尽量采取少吃多孵的办法，把种蛋准备充足，自己不能解决的部分，主动同商业部门联系，由商业部门负责调剂供应。孵房也可以采取以雏换蛋等办法和社员合作，筹集种蛋孵化。有条件的孵房还应该增设育雏室，把雏禽多养几天。并且拨一部分精料供孵房雏禽喂用。同时，还必须加强雏鸡疫病的防治工作，以提高雏鸡的成活率。
    通知最后要求各地抓紧养禽场的工具改革工作，及时总结和推广这方面的先进经验。
