Xinhua News Agency News: Employees of the Kunlun Photography Studio in Guangzhou have recently successfully trial-produced a light-metering automatic photo printer and a small-sized developing and printing cabinet, greatly improving the efficiency of photo printing work.

    Automatic Light Adjustment, Continuous Printing
    In the past, photo printing relied on skilled workers who used their experience to analyze the thickness of the negatives and determine the exposure time, printing each photo one by one. After using the light-metering automatic photo printer, the light quantity can be automatically adjusted according to the thickness of the negatives, automatic exposure, and automatic paper feeding. As long as the negatives are loaded and the button is pressed, continuous printing can be performed. Compared with manual operation, it improves efficiency thirty times and can guarantee quality, producing no waste products. The operation is also very simple, and even apprentices can operate it.
    Developing Negatives Without Entering the Darkroom
    In the past, developing photos or negatives was done in a darkroom. The small-sized developing and printing cabinet designed and manufactured by the employees of the Kunlun Photography Studio reduces the darkroom to a cabinet the size of a filing cabinet. The cabinet surface is inlaid with tinted glass to prevent light. Workers can sit next to the cabinet and reach their hands into the cabinet to operate. The cabinet can be placed anywhere, and workers no longer have to be confined to the darkroom for developing.

    晒相新机器
    据新华社讯　广州市昆仑摄影院职工最近试制成功测光自动晒相机和小型冲晒柜，大大提高了晒相工作效率。
    自动调光　连续印相
    过去晒相是依靠技术熟练的工人，凭经验分析、底片的厚薄，确定爆光的时间，一张一张印晒的。使用测光自动晒相机后，可以根据底片厚薄，自动调节光量，自动爆光，自动过纸，只要把底片上好，按动电钮，就可以连续印相。比起手工操作，它提高效率三十倍，而且可以保证质量，不出废品，操作上也很简便，徒工都可以操纵。
    冲底片不用进暗房
    过去冲洗照片或底片，都在暗房中进行。昆仑摄影院职工设计制成的小型冲晒柜，是把暗房缩小为一张公事柜大小的柜子，柜面镶上茶色玻璃防光，工人可以坐在柜子旁边把手伸进柜中去操作。柜子可以放在任何地方，工人再不用关在暗房里冲洗了。
