    Exercising to Build Strength and Improve Physical Fitness
    Mass Sports Activities Flourish in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia

    (Our Report) Mass sports activities are thriving in Jilin Province. Since November of last year, various localities have launched winter sports movements centered on skating and skiing, with more than 3.4 million people participating in the exercises, an increase of about 13% compared to 1958. Participants in skating and skiing include not only young, middle-aged, and older people, but also many elderly, weak, women, and children. In ice and snow sports, various localities have further implemented the principle of relying on the masses and running sports undertakings diligently and thriftily, adopting methods of using local materials and combining indigenous and foreign methods to build ice rinks and snow fields, and making their own ice skates and simple skis. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 ice and snow fields have been built in the province, with 180,000 pairs of ice skates and more than 2,000 pairs of skis of various types. Most secondary schools and some primary schools in the province have skating rinks.

    In addition to ice and snow sports, other winter sports are also very active, such as basketball, volleyball, football, martial arts, and Chinese chess, totaling no less than twenty kinds. National defense sports projects such as shooting, aviation modeling, and radio are also being carried out quite widely. During this period, sports activities in rural areas are also very active. During the New Year's Day holiday this year, various people's communes throughout the province universally held various sports competitions.

    The widespread and in-depth development of mass sports activities has greatly enhanced people's physical fitness and promoted continuous leaps forward in production, work, and study. In places where sports activities are carried out well, the incidence of disease has decreased significantly, attendance rates have greatly improved, and everyone is full of energy. The Jilin Diesel Engine Factory is an advanced unit in Changchun City's sports activities. The factory's attendance rate has increased from 85% in the past to 98%. Since the beginning of this year, the attendance rate of several workshops has reached 100%. Female workers account for 82% of the Yanbian Rubber Factory, and most of them are mothers. Because they generally adhere to physical exercise throughout the year, the attendance rate has increased from 81% in the past to 91%, thus successfully completing production tasks. Ninety-nine percent of the employees of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, who participate in physical exercise throughout the year, used to suffer from neurasthenia, hematemesis, and gastroptosis, and often could not go to work. Through regular physical exercise, they not only recovered their health, but some of them also passed the first and second-level standards of the Labor and Defense System. Many students have significantly improved their academic performance due to their active participation in sports activities.

    At present, various localities are summarizing and evaluating winter sports activities and deploying and carrying out spring sports activities centered on radio gymnastics and long-distance running.

    (Our Report) After two consecutive years of great leaps forward in sports in Heilongjiang Province, mass sports movements have spread from cities to the vast rural areas, forest areas, and mines, and from young people to middle-aged and elderly people, achieving a situation of "perennial prosperity and evergreen throughout the four seasons." Sports projects have also become more diverse, with land, air, mountain, and water projects available. The number of people who regularly participate in sports activities accounts for about one-third of the province's total population.

    At present, various localities are carrying out spring sports activities. Since the Harbin Municipal Party Committee issued the call for the "small ball" movement, the city's children immediately responded, and more than 190,000 people participated in the mini-basketball movement. Even kindergarten children have begun outdoor activities. In rural areas, commune members are vigorously carrying out spring sports activities in conjunction with spring plowing and sowing. Zhaozhou County, in conjunction with militia training, launched a national defense sports movement of 10,000 people shooting during spring wheat sowing. Liaodian People's Commune in Acheng County carried out radio gymnastics, mountain climbing, and hunting activities during the gaps in spring sowing.

    The widespread development of mass sports movements has played a positive role in enhancing people's physical fitness and promoting continuous leaps forward in production. Due to the great development of sports activities, the incidence of disease has been greatly reduced among workers, enterprises, institutions, schools, cities and rural areas throughout the province. For example, all the employees of the state-owned Hongguang Sugar Factory who participated in sports have passed the Labor and Defense System. The incidence of disease among the factory's employees has decreased significantly, with a 40% reduction in 1959 compared to 1958. The labor efficiency of the commune members of the Haijiang People's Commune in Nenjiang County has increased by 30% after physical exercise. The "52" district of this commune has basically controlled the occurrence of "Keshan disease" due to its persistence in physical exercise.

    (Our Report) Mass sports activities are very active in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. At present, more than 2 million workers, farmers, herdsmen, government cadres, and students are participating in various sports activities, an increase of 80% compared to the number of people participating in sports activities during the same period last spring. Among the 130,000 people participating in Labor and Defense System exercises, more than 26,500 have reached the level of sports athletes. The number of master athletes has also increased from 13 in 1958 to 28 now.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of mass sports activities, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established leadership organizations at all levels from top to bottom. At present, the region's grassroots sports associations have grown to 696, including more than 200 people's commune sports associations in rural and pastoral areas, and more than 150 spare-time sports schools for young people have been established in accordance with local conditions, which has effectively promoted the development of mass sports activities. According to statistics from the region, since last winter, more than 50 new sports activities have been added, including aviation modeling, radio control, and skiing. Especially in pastoral communes, in addition to carrying out traditional ethnic sports activities such as horse racing and wrestling, which were rare in winter and spring, herdsmen have also universally carried out various ball games. Whether in pastoral or agricultural areas, almost every people's commune and even production team has established basketball courts and table tennis courts. Many production team farmers also use their rest time to do "on-the-job exercises" in the fields.

    In carrying out mass sports activities, all localities have adhered to the spirit of being simple and economical and relying on their own efforts. If there is no sports equipment, they automatically dedicate labor and materials, and use their spare time to build venues and make their own horizontal bars, parallel bars, basketball hoops, high jump racks, table tennis tables, hand grenades, and javelins, and use stone weights for weightlifting exercises, solving the problem of insufficient equipment. When there is a lack of technical guidance for physical exercise, commune members ask cadres who go to the countryside or find books as teachers, achieving the goal of learning and improving at the same time.

    The widespread development of mass sports activities has further enhanced the physical fitness of people of all ethnic groups. The Baotou Steel Design Institute and the Hohhot No. 1 Wool Textile Factory, the Inner Mongolia Printing Factory and other units have achieved daily activities and daily competitions, making the employees stronger and stronger, reducing diseases, and achieving a monthly attendance rate of 98%. Zhang Dewen, a wool textile worker who once created a national advanced record in velvet weaving, used to suffer from illness and affect production. Since the Great Leap Forward, he has insisted on various ball games and long-distance running and other sports exercises every day, and his health has gradually recovered. Now he has become a high-yield and high-quality pacesetter on the industrial front in Hohhot. Guo Wei, a Han female cadre in her fifties in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Public Security Department, insisted on exercising with her son and grandson every day after the department held a symbolic long-distance run last December. By now, she has run more than 700,000 meters, which is equivalent to the distance from Hohhot to Beijing. She used to suffer from arthritis, but now she is cured. She was named a "March 8th" Red Banner Bearer in Hohhot City and an advanced worker in the Public Security Department this year on "March 8th" Women's Day. (Attached picture)

    锻炼身体  增强体质
    吉林、黑龙江和内蒙古群众性体育活动蓬勃开展
    本报讯　吉林省群众性的体育活动蓬勃发展。从去年11月份开始，各地开展了以滑冰和滑雪为中心的冬季体育运动，全省有三百四十多万人参加了锻炼，比1958年增加了13％左右。参加滑冰滑雪的除青、少、壮年外，还包括许多老、弱、妇、孺等人。在冰雪运动中，各地进一步贯彻了依靠群众、勤俭办体育事业的原则，采取就地取材，土洋结合的办法，大建冰场、雪场，自制冰刀、简易雪板等。据不完全统计，全省共建冰、雪场三千余处，有各种冰刀十八万双，各种雪板二千多副。全省绝大部分中等以上的学校和部分小学，都有滑冰场。
    除冰雪运动以外，其他项目的冬季体育运动，也十分活跃。如篮、排、足球，武术、象棋等不下二十种；射击、航空模型、无线电等国防体育项目，开展得也很普遍。这个时期，农村的体育活动也十分活跃。在今年元旦假期，全省各人民公社较普遍地举行了各种体育竞赛活动。
    群众性体育活动广泛深入地开展，大大增进了人们的体质，促进生产、工作和学习不断跃进。体育活动开展得好的地方，患病率都有显著下降，出勤率大大提高，人人精神旺盛。吉林省柴油机厂是长春市体育活动的先进单位，全厂出勤率由过去的85％提高到98％，今年以来有好几个车间出勤率达到100％。延边橡胶厂的女职工占82％，大部分是孩子妈妈，由于她们普遍常年坚持体育锻炼，出勤率由过去的81％上升到91％，因而出色地完成生产任务。99％的职工都常年参加体育锻炼的吉林省林业厅，过去有些人患神经衰弱、吐血、胃下垂等疾病，经常不能上班，通过经常性的体育锻炼，不但恢复了健康，有的人还通过了劳卫制一级和二级标准。许多学校的学生由于积极参加体育活动，学习成绩有了显著提高。
    目前，各地都在总结评比冬季体育活动的基础上，部署和开展以广播体操和长跑为中心的春季体育活动。
    本报讯　黑龙江省经过连续两年的体育大跃进，群众体育运动已经从城市普及到广大农村、林区和矿山，由青少年普及到壮年人、老年人；并且达到了“常年旺盛、四季长青”的局面。运动项目也更加多样了，陆地、天空、高山、水上的项目样样有。全省经常参加体育活动的人数占全省总人口的三分之一左右。
    目前，各地正在开展春季体育活动。自从中共哈尔滨市委发出“小小球”运动的号召以后，全市少年儿童立即响应，参加小篮球运动的就达十九万多人，连幼儿园的孩子们也开始了户外活动。在农村，社员们结合春耕播种，蓬蓬勃勃地开展起春季体育活动。肇州县在春麦播种中，结合民兵训练，开展了万人射击的国防体育运动。阿城县料甸人民公社，在春播的空隙开展了广播体操、爬山和打猎等活动。
    群众性体育运动的广泛开展，对增强人民体质、促进生产不断跃进，起到了积极作用。全省各地的工矿企业、机关学校、城市和乡村广大人民，由于体育运动的大发展，发病率大大减少了。如国营红光糖厂，参加体育运动的职工已全部通过了劳卫制。这个厂职工中的发病率大大下降，1959年比1958年降低了40％。嫩江县海江人民公社的社员们，经过体育锻炼后，劳动效率比过去提高了30％。这个公社“五二”区，由于坚持了体育锻炼，基本上控制了“克山病”的发生。
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区群众性体育活动十分活跃。目前，参加各种体育活动的工人、农民、牧民、机关干部和学生达二百多万人，比去年春天同期参加体育活动的人数增加了80％。在参加劳卫制锻炼的十三万人中，有二万六千五百多人达到了等级运动员标准。运动健将也由1958年的十三名增加到现在的二十八名。
    为了加强群众性的体育活动的领导，内蒙古自治区从上到下层层建立起领导机构。现在全区基层体协已发展到六百九十六个，其中农村和牧区的人民公社体协就有二百多个，并因地制宜地建立起青少年业余体育学校一百五十多所，有力地促进了群众性体育活动的开展。据全区统计，仅从去冬到现在，新增加的体育活动项目，就有航空模型、无线电操纵和滑雪等五十多个。特别是在牧区公社，牧民们除了破例地在冬春季节开展民族传统的赛马、摔跤等民族体育活动外，还普遍地开展了各种球类活动。不论是牧区和农业区，几乎每个人民公社甚至生产队都建立了篮球场和乒乓球场。许多生产队的农民，还利用休息时间，在田头作“工间操”。
    在开展群众性体育活动中，各地都本着因陋就简，自力更生的精神，没有运动器材，就自动献工献料，并利用业余时间修建场地，自制单杠、双杠、篮球架、跳高架、乒乓台、手榴弹和标枪，用石担子进行举重练习，解决了器材不足问题。当体育锻炼缺乏技术指导时，公社社员们就请下乡干部或者找书本为老师，做到了边学习边提高。
    群众性体育活动的广泛开展，进一步增强了各族人民的体质。包钢设计院和呼和浩特市第一毛纺织厂、内蒙古印刷厂等单位，实现了天天有活动，日日有比赛，使职工们身体愈练愈强，减少了疾病，每月出勤率达到98％。曾经创造过全国织绒先进纪录的毛纺织工人张德文，过去经常患病，影响生产。从大跃进以来，他每天坚持各种球类和长跑等体育锻炼，身体逐渐恢复健康，现在已成为呼和浩特市工业战线上的高产优质标兵。内蒙古自治区公安厅五十多岁的汉族女干部郭维，去年12月厅里举行象征性长跑开始后，她每天带着儿子和孙子坚持锻炼，到现在她已跑了七十多万米，相当于由呼和浩特到北京的距离。过去她患有关节炎病，现在也好了。今年“三八”节被评为呼和浩特市的“三八”红旗手和公安厅的先进工作者。（附图片）
