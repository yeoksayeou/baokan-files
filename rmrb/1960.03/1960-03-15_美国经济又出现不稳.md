    The American Economy is Again Unstable
    Zhang Zhenya
        Stock Prices Plunge

    The American economy, just as it entered what the US President called "an era with the hope of becoming the most prosperous in American history" (State of the Union Address) in 1960, showed ominous signs. As the most sensitive barometer reflecting the American economy, the New York Stock Market, starting from January 5th, completely disregarded the optimistic estimates of the economic outlook made by official spokespersons and kept scholars, and began a sharp decline caused by stocks being unwanted. It barely managed to stabilize by mid-February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 685 to 619, a drop of more than 10%, becoming the most severe plunge since the stock price decline caused by the last economic crisis on October 12, 1957. Among them, the stock prices of the aircraft manufacturing industry fell by 13%, the steel industry fell by 11.5%, automobiles fell by 12.6%, the chemical industry fell by 8.6%...
    At a time when there were no sudden international or domestic events in the United States to cause economic instability, the New York Stock Market experienced a slump. Besides indicating that American investors were greatly worried about the US economic prospects again just over a year after the 1957-1958 economic crisis, there is hardly any other explanation. Facts prove that this is indeed the case.
    The decline in stock prices occurred during a period of rising US industrial production. Since American steelworkers were forced to return to work on November 7 last year, US industrial production has begun to rebound. According to the new US official industrial index (much higher than the old index, which incorporates the production of electricity and natural gas), the industrial production in December reached 165 (1947-1949 as 100), an increase of 5.75% compared to the November industrial index of 156, creating the highest monthly production increase in nearly seven years. In January of this year, industrial output increased by another 3% compared to December last year, with the index reaching 169. With this rise, the American business community launched a chorus of cheers for the American economic prospects in 1960. Led by the steel and automobile industries, the American business community has successively formulated production increase plans to welcome the new year. However, as soon as the January plan was put into effect, the market situation began to change.

    Automobiles and Steel "Surplus"
    Automobile manufacturers, who originally planned to sell one million more cars this year (i.e., a total of 6.5 million cars), formulated ambitious production plans for the first quarter of this year before the New Year: 690,000 cars in January, 728,000 cars in February, and 850,000 cars in March. However, the automobile sales results in January were much lower than their estimates, with only more than 400,000 cars sold. This caused the automobile inventory in the hands of dealers to surge from 570,000 vehicles at the end of last year to 810,000 vehicles at the end of January. As a result, the automobile manufacturing industry quickly cut its February production plan by 80,000 vehicles. However, this did not reverse the situation. As of February 20, the automobile inventory accumulated in the hands of dealers had exceeded one million vehicles. The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which has been touting "prosperity" since the beginning of the year, had to admit on March 7: "From all indications, automobile production in March will drop sharply."

    The situation in the steel industry is very similar to that in the automobile industry. The giants of the steel industry also have great hopes for the steel "prosperity" in 1960. They estimated that the sales volume of steel this year would be 135 million tons, which means that they believe 1960 will be a record-breaking year for steel production (the previous highest record was 117 million tons in 1955). However, producing 12 million tons of steel in January immediately created a "surplus of steel." 2.5 million tons of steel, or more than 20% of the monthly output, were directly put into warehouses. In addition, 700,000 tons of steel were accumulated in the hands of automobile dealers in the form of 250,000 unsold cars. This means that more than a quarter of the steel produced in January was actually "surplus." As a result, there was a decline in steel orders. The automobile industry reduced steel orders by 10% in January due to "unsatisfactory" automobile sales, and is continuing to cut orders. Many small steel users have also postponed and canceled orders. According to the latest US "Steel Age" magazine, "Agricultural equipment and construction machinery industries will reduce steel orders by 50% in the second quarter of this year. The household appliance industry will also reduce orders by about 30% due to too many orders already placed."
    Faced with this trend, the steel industry had to gradually reduce the operating rate: from 95.7% in mid-January to 93.1% recently. The original plan was to drop to 84%-88% in the second quarter, but recently it was decided to drop to 80% in May. The price of scrap steel, which reflects the temperature gauge of steel production (in the United States steel production, scrap steel remelting accounts for a large proportion), fell to 34 US dollars per ton on February 24, a drop of eight US dollars compared to the market price at the end of January. In the first half of February, the largest US Steel Corporation also temporarily closed one of its large steel pipe plants and laid off 500 workers.

    The deterioration of sales is not only happening in the automobile and steel industries. The number of new contracts ordered by the construction industry in January decreased by 5% compared to the level in 1959. The production of the oil industry is in "surplus," the prospects for the aircraft manufacturing industry are bleak, railway freight is shrinking... According to figures released by the US Department of Commerce on March 1, new orders received by the US manufacturing industry in January decreased by as much as 10 billion US dollars compared to December last year.

    In this case, the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which has been boasting that the United States will have a "great prosperity," had to say with a pessimistic tone in its February 29 issue this year: "American business activity now shows signs of losing some momentum. Indicators that usually indicate future trends provide weak evidence. Industrial stock prices have fallen sharply from their January peak. Spot market commodity prices have been weak for some time. Recently, the number of business bankruptcies has been more than a year ago. However, the opening of new business companies is not as good as at the beginning of 1959. New orders for durable goods have been disappointing in recent weeks. New residential construction contracts continue to fall." The magazine warned that these six aspects are six of the "eight indicators used by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which usually predict the turning point of the business cycle." As for the remaining two (factory construction contracts and the average weekly working hours of factories), "there are no signs of prosperity now."

    It can be seen that the decline in the New York Stock Market is not a sudden gust of wind, but is related to the unstable prospects that have emerged in the American economy.

    Production "Surplus" Cannot be Solved

    The American economy, which has just emerged from the crisis and is taking a breather, has seen ominous clouds of crisis on the horizon again. Why is this? It turns out that although the United States experienced the 1957-1958 crisis, its production capacity "surplus" and the fundamental contradiction between production and the sales market have not only not been resolved, but are still expanding. The manufacturing industry's production equipment capacity was not damaged in the 1958 crisis, but increased by 4%. In 1959, it increased again by 5%. On the other hand, the increase in people's purchasing power is very limited. According to the US national "personal income" figures published by the US Federal Reserve Bulletin, it was 359 billion US dollars in 1958, only an increase of 2.4% compared to the previous year's 350.6 billion US dollars. In 1959, this figure increased to 369 billion US dollars, only an increase of nearly 3% compared to 1958. The factors of inflation and population increase in the past two years have not been taken into account here. If these factors are added, then the actual increase in purchasing power is even lower, far behind the increase in the manufacturing industry's production equipment capacity. Although industrial production in 1959 increased significantly compared to 1958, it was only 5% higher than in 1957. This increase largely relied on the US government using anti-crisis measures: increasing military and public works expenditures, expanding credit, etc. The result of increasing military and public works expenditures has caused the US federal government to have a huge deficit of 12.4 billion US dollars in the 1959 fiscal year. The result of expanding consumer credit has increased the short-term and medium-term debt of US consumers by 5.4 billion US dollars in 1959, becoming the largest increase in consumer debt since 1955. From November last year to January this year, US industry did rebound rapidly. However, this rebound was mainly due to the end of the steel strike, and companies rushed to replenish their commodity inventories. This increase in inventories had reached near saturation point by January. According to a March 2 "New York Times" report, the rate of increase in commodity inventories in the hands of US manufacturing industry in December last year and January this year was extremely abnormal. The monthly increase in inventory reached as much as 800 million US dollars. At the end of January, the inventory in the hands of the manufacturing industry reached 53.2 billion US dollars, only 1 billion US dollars less than the record-breaking inventory of 54.2 billion US dollars in the hands of the manufacturing industry before the outbreak of the last crisis in August 1957. Since the sales volume of the manufacturing industry is currently 30.8 billion US dollars, only slightly higher than the 29 billion US dollars in July 1957, the inventory of the manufacturing industry can no longer be massively increased. If it continues to increase, a crisis will definitely occur in the second half of the year.

    The only way out is for companies to reduce purchases. But this will lead to stagnation and decline in industrial production. In fact, judging from the materials reflected in recent American newspapers, there are signs of stagnation in industrial production in February.

    Hopes Will be Dashed

    The giants of the American business community originally hoped that the shortage of business inventories and the shortage of goods in the consumer market caused by the steel strike of more than three months from July 15 to November 7 last year would create a situation of "supply falling short of demand" in the first half of this year. They estimated that the increase in sales in the first half of this year would enable large-scale purchases by companies to continue until the middle of the year. After the middle of the year, the increase in corporate fixed capital investment can be used to fill the gap, so that the entire year of 1960 can maintain economic "prosperity." But from the current situation, the first hope has been dashed. Because the current inventory of the manufacturing industry is too large compared to the sales volume, the scale of corporate purchases in December last year and January this year obviously cannot be maintained in the following months. As for the second hope: that corporate fixed capital investment will increase significantly this year, it also appears to be close to being dashed. Because although the US Department of Commerce and the "Securities and Exchange Commission" recently boasted again that corporate fixed capital investment in the United States this year will be 14% higher than last year, reaching 37 billion US dollars. However, this figure is only equal to the level of corporate fixed investment in the United States in 1957. Even if this wish is fulfilled, it will not be enough to stimulate a "prosperity." What's more, the US "Fortune" magazine in its February issue this year has pointed out that this type of investment figure is "always difficult to estimate" because companies can stop this type of investment at any time when the economic situation is not good.

    When the economy has not stopped rising, the American business community is showing uneasy emotions again and making various speculations about the future. This cannot help but remind people of the situation at the beginning of 1957. At that time, after a stock market crash, the American newspapers had conflicting opinions on the economic outlook, and a crisis occurred eight months later.

    Of course, the current American economic situation is different from that in 1957. But the unstable situation is very similar, perhaps even worse. Because the focus of the current debate among American business people is whether the arrival of the "recession" will be in the second half of 1960 or in 1961, rather than whether a recession will occur. On the latter point, their opinions do not differ.

    美国经济又出现不稳
    张振亚
        股票价格大跌
    美国的经济刚进入被美国总统称作“有希望成为美国历史上最繁荣的年代”（国情咨文）的1960年，就出现了不祥的征兆。作为反映美国经济最灵敏的气温表的纽约证券市场从1月5日起，竟完全不顾官方发言人和御用学者对经济前景所作的乐观估计，开始了一次由于股票无人问津造成的猛烈跌风。一直到2月中才勉强站稳脚跟。道·琼斯编制的工业股票价格指数从六百八十五下跌到六百一十九，下降幅度达10％以上，成为1957年10月12日上次经济危机引起股票价格下降以来最厉害的一次暴跌。其中飞机制造业的股票价格下跌了13％，钢铁业的股票价格下跌了11．5％，汽车下跌12．6％，化学工业下跌8．6％……
    在国际局势和美国国内没有任何猝发事件足以引起经济不稳的情势，纽约证券市场却爆发了一场跌风，这除了表明美国投资者在1957年—1958年的经济危机才过去一年多的时间就又对美国的经济前景发生了很大的忧虑以外，是很难有别种解释的。事实证明，情况正是这样。
    这次股票行情的下跌，是发生在美国工业生产正在上升的时期。从去年11月7日美国钢铁工人被迫复工以后，美国的工业生产开始回升。根据美国官方新编的工业指数（比旧指数高了很多，其中加入了电力和天然气的生产），12月份的工业生产达到一百六十五（1947年—1949年为一百），比11月的工业指数一百五十六上升了5．75％，创造了近七年来月增产的最高纪录。今年1月份工业产量又比去年12月增加了3％，指数达到一百六十九。随着这种上升，美国企业界就对1960年的美国经济前景掀起了一片欢乐的呼嚷。以钢铁和汽车工业为首的美国企业界纷纷制订了迎接新的一年的增产计划。可是1月份的计划刚付诸实施，市场情况就开始了变化。
    汽车和钢铁“过剩”
    原准备在今年多销售一百万辆（即一共销售六百五十万辆）汽车的汽车制造商，在年前就为今年第一季度制订了野心勃勃的生产计划：1月份生产六十九万辆汽车，2月份生产七十二万八千辆，3月份生产八十五万辆。但是1月份的汽车销售结果大大低于他们的估计，只销出四十多万辆汽车。这使经销商手中的汽车存货从去年底的五十七万辆激增至1月底的八十一万辆。于是汽车制造业连忙把2月份的生产计划削减了八万辆。可是这样做并没有扭转局势。截至2月20日止，经销商手中积压的汽车存货已超过一百万辆。年初以来，一直在鼓吹“繁荣”的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志3月7日不得不承认：“从各种迹象看，3月份的汽车生产将急骤下降。”
    钢铁业的情况和汽车工业大同小异。钢铁业的巨头们对于1960年的钢铁“繁荣”也是抱有很大希望。他们把今年钢的销售量估计为一亿三千五百万吨，也就是说，他们认为1960年将是钢产量破纪录的一年（以前最高的纪录是1955年的一亿一千七百万吨）。但是1月份生产了一千二百万吨钢，就立刻造成了“钢的过剩”。二百五十万吨钢也就是月产量的20％以上，被直接放入仓库。另外有七十万吨钢以二十五万辆滞销汽车的形式积压在汽车经销商手中。这就是说，1月份所产的钢实际上竟有四分之一以上是“过剩”的。于是形成了钢铁订货的下降。汽车业在汽车销售“不合理想”的情况下，1月份已减少了10％的钢铁订货，而且还在继续削减订货。许多小的钢铁用户也推迟和取消了订货。据最近美国“钢铁时代”杂志透露，“农业装备和建筑机器工业在今年第二季将减少钢铁订货50％。家用器具工业也因已订货太多，而将减少约30％”。
    面临这种趋势的钢铁业遂不得不把开工率逐步降低：从1月中旬的95．7％下降到最近的93．1％，第二季原计划降到84％—88％，最近又决定在5月份就降到80％。作为反映钢铁生产的气温表的废钢价格（在美国钢铁生产中，废钢回炉占很大的比例）在2月24日已落到三十四美元一吨，比1月底的行市竟落了八元之多。2月份上半月，最大的美国钢铁公司还暂时关闭了它的一家大的钢管厂，遣散了五百名工人。
    销售情况的恶化不仅仅发生在汽车和钢铁业。建筑业1月份订的新合同比1959年的水平减少了5％。石油工业的生产在“过剩”，飞机制造业前景黯淡，铁路货运在减缩……根据3月1日美国商务部发表的数字，美国制造业1月份接到的新订货单已比去年12月减少了十亿美元之多。
    在这种情况下，一直吹嘘美国将出现“大繁荣”的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在它今年2月29日一期中不得不带着悲观的调子说：“美国企业活动现在已经露出了丧失若干劲头的迹象。通常指示未来趋势的指标提供了疲弱的证明。工业股票价格从1月份的高峰急剧下跌。现货市场的商品价格若干时日以来一直疲软无力。近来企业破产的数目比一年前要多。而新企业公司的开设却比不上1959年年初。耐用品的新订货单最近几周一直令人失望。新住宅的建筑合同继续在下跌。”杂志发出警告说，这六个方面是“美国全国经济研究所使用的、通常预示企业循环的转折的八个指标”中的六个，至于余下的两个（工厂的建筑合同和工厂平均每周开工时间），“现在也看不出有任何繁荣的迹象”。
    可见，纽约证券市场的这场跌风并不是空谷来风，而是同美国经济已出现了不稳定的前景有关。
    生产“过剩”无法解决
    摆脱危机不久、喘息未定的美国经济，又在地平线上望见了险恶的危机的黑云，这是为什么呢？原来美国尽管经历了1957—1958年的危机，它的生产力的“过剩”、生产和销售市场之间的根本矛盾不但未解决，而且仍在日益扩大。制造业的生产设备能力在1958年危机中并未遭破坏，反而提高了4％。在1959年又再提高了5％。另一方面人民购买力的增加却很有限。根据美国联邦储备局公报发表的美国全国“个人收入”数字，1958年是三千五百九十亿美元，只比前一年的三千五百零六亿美元增加了2．4％，1959年这个数字增加到三千六百九十亿美元，也只比1958年增加了近3％。这里还没有把两年来的通货膨胀和人口增加的因素考虑在内。如果加上这些因素，那么实际购买力的增加比这还要低，远赶不上制造业生产设备的能力的增加。1959年工业生产虽较1958年有显著提高，但比1957年只高5％。而这种增加在很大程度上是依靠了美国政府使用反危机措施：增大军事和公共工程开支、扩充信贷等造成的。增大军事和公共工程开支的结果已造成了美国联邦政府1959财政年度出现一百二十四亿美元的庞大赤字。扩大消费信贷的结果则使1959年美国消费者的短期和中期债务增加了五十四亿美元，成为1955年以来消费者债务上升最大的一年。从去年11月到今年1月，美国工业确是在迅速回升。可是这种回升主要是由于钢铁罢工结束，企业纷纷补进商品库存的结果。这种库存的增加到1月份已接近饱和点。根据3月2日“纽约时报”的消息，去年12月和今年1月美国制造业手中的商品库存上升速度极不正常。每月存货的增加额达八亿美元之多。1月底制造业手中的存货已达五百三十二亿美元。比1957年8月上次危机爆发前夕制造业手中的破纪录存货五百四十二亿美元只差十亿美元。由于制造业的销货量目前为三百零八亿美元，比1957年7月的二百九十亿美元只稍稍高一点，因此，制造业的存货已不能再大规模增加。如果继续增加，下半年危机肯定就会出现。
    唯一出路只有企业减少进货。但是这样又会导致工业生产的停滞和下降。实际上从最近美国报刊所反映的材料看，2月份的工业生产已有出现停滞的迹象。
    指望都将落空
    美国企业界的巨头们原指望经过去年7月15日到11月7日三个多月的钢铁罢工造成的企业库存短缺和消费市场缺货情况会使今年上半年出现“供不应求”的局面。他们曾估计今年上半年销售量的增加会使企业大规模的进货能一直继续到年中。年中以后则可借企业固定资本投资的增加来弥补空缺，这样就能使1960年全年保持经济“繁荣”。但是从目前情况看，第一个希望已经落空了。因为目前制造业的存货同销售量相比已经过大，去年12月和今年1月份的企业进货规模在以后几个月中显然不能保持下去。至于第二个指望：今年企业固定资本投资会大大增加，看来也接近落空。因为尽管美国商务部及“证券和交易委员会”最近又吹嘘说，今年美国企业固定资本投资要比去年高14％，达到三百七十亿美元。可是这一数字只等于1957年美国企业固定投资的水平。即使如愿，也不足以刺激一次“繁荣”。更何况今年2月号的美国“幸福”杂志已指出，这类投资数字“一向很难估计”，因为在经济情况不妙的时候，企业可以随时停止这类投资。
    在经济还没有停止上升的时候，美国企业界又表现出忡忡不安的心情，对前景作出种种揣测。这不由使人想起了1957年年初的情景，当时也是在证券市场跌风之后，美国报刊对经济前景意见纷纭，八个月之后就出现了危机。
    当然，目前美国经济情况不同于1957年。但是不稳定的状况却十分类似，也许还要坏些。因为目前美国企业界人士所争论的焦点乃是“衰退”的到来是在1960年下半年抑或是1961年，而不是衰退会不会发生。在后面一点上，他们的意见并没有分歧。
