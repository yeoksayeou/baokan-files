(Our Report) People's communes have enabled Chinese women to embark on the road to complete liberation, bringing a new look to the women's movement. Hundreds of millions of women warmly support the people's communes, praising them as the "golden bridge" to the communist paradise.

　　When the people's communes were first organized, they had a significant impact on the vast number of rural women. The development of commune enterprises urgently required the complete liberation of China's women's abundant labor potential. As early as 1958, tens of millions of rural women across the country had left their families and enthusiastically participated in various rural production and construction projects. After the people's communes were established, almost all rural women with labor ability participated in various social labor activities. In addition, the percentage of labor days completed by women as a proportion of the total number of rural male and female labor days has also been increasing year by year. In 1957, it accounted for 31.5%, increasing to 35% in 1959, with some provinces reaching 40%-45%, and individual provinces reaching about 50%.

　　The widespread participation of women in social labor urgently required a solution to the contradiction between collective production and individual consumption, and the issue of socializing housework was quickly raised nationwide. People's communes established a large number of collective welfare undertakings. By the end of 1959, there were 3.9 million rural public canteens, and according to statistics from six provinces including Zhejiang, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, and Shanxi, the number of people eating in canteens accounted for about 70%-90% of the total population, with Henan and Hunan provinces reaching 99%. There are currently 3.69 million childcare organizations in rural areas across the country. According to statistics from six provinces including Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Jiangxi, the number of children in childcare accounts for 60%-80% of the total number of children who should be in childcare. Collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings such as rural maternity hospitals, sewing factories, shoe factories, rice mills, and flour mills have also developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from three provinces including Liaoning, Hebei, and Shanxi, there are more than 70,000 sewing factories. The Jinan Prefecture of Shanxi has basically solved the problem of clothing.

　　The large-scale development of collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings has freed women from worrying about housework such as cooking, taking care of children, and making clothes, allowing them to concentrate on participating in social labor, which greatly contributes to the complete liberation of China's women's labor force. In 1958, approximately 55 million women across the country were liberated from heavy housework, the vast majority of whom were rural women. This huge force put into various rural production undertakings has powerfully promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production.

　　After the people's communes were established, the ideological outlook of the vast number of women underwent tremendous changes through collective labor and collective life, and under the education of the Party. In the past, women were limited to small family circles, and what they came into contact with were pots and pans, needles and threads, so their horizons were not broad and their minds were narrow. Now, they are in contact with major national affairs, so their socialist consciousness has been significantly improved, their collective concept and communist spirit of cooperation have been greatly enhanced, and they go wherever the Party points. The highest peak of the Pailou Mountain in Haiyuan County, Ningxia, which is about 2,000 meters above sea level, has been eroded by wind and rain, and no grass or trees grow there. Women responded to the Party's call and worked hard for more than 70 days, planting more than 2,000 trees and controlling soil erosion in an area of more than 2,000 mu. Because of the good completion of the task, it was named "March 8th" Mountain.

　　After the socialization of housework, the vast number of women have worked hard to learn culture and study technology, and have achieved remarkable results. In 1958, more than 16 million women across the country were freed from illiteracy, the vast majority of whom were rural women. The improvement of cultural level has brought a lot of convenience to studying technology. At present, rural women are generally planting large areas of high-yield fields and experimental fields, everyone is learning technology, and everyone is engaged in innovation, and thousands of red banner holders, female production experts, and clever girls have emerged.

　　Women have participated in social labor, have culture, and have mastered technology, making significant contributions to the socialist cause of the motherland, which has greatly improved their social status. Now, many outstanding women across the country have been elected by the people to serve in various grassroots leadership positions. According to statistics from September 1959, there were more than 5,690 female chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of people's communes across the country, and almost all production teams have female captains.

　　After the communes were established, the status of women in Chinese families has been greatly changed, and a large number of united and harmonious new socialist families have emerged. In terms of distribution, people's communes currently mainly implement a wage system based on work, while also implementing a partial supply system with the germ of distribution according to need. The supply system is the most important and reliable social insurance for every male and female commune member. And wages are directly paid to each laborer, and women receive their own wages. This has enabled women to gain economic independence, thereby further breaking down the remnants of the feudal patriarchal system and making family life happier. The new family relationship of unity and harmony has further promoted the development of production.

    人民公社化给妇女带来的好处说不完
    农村妇女走上彻底解放的道路
    涌现了许多红旗手、生产能手和巧姑娘
    本报讯　人民公社化使我国妇女走上了彻底解放的道路，给妇女运动带来了一片崭新的面貌。亿万妇女热烈拥护人民公社，她们赞美人民公社是通向共产主义天堂的“金桥”。
    人民公社一当组织起来的时候，就对广大农村妇女发生了重大的影响。公社事业的发展，迫切需要彻底解放我国妇女雄厚的劳动潜力。还在1958年，全国就有几千万农村妇女走出家庭，热情地参加了农村中各项生产建设。人民公社化以后，凡是有劳动能力的农村妇女，几乎都参加了各项社会劳动。另外，妇女完成的劳动日数占农村男女劳动日总数的百分比，也在逐年上升。1957年占31．5％，1959年增加到35％，有些省达到40％—45％，个别省达到50％左右。
    广大妇女参加社会劳动，迫切需要解决集体生产和个体消费之间的矛盾，家务劳动社会化的问题很快在全国范围内提出来了。人民公社举办了大量的集体福利事业。农村公共食堂，1959年底达到三百九十万个，在食堂吃饭的人数，据浙江、贵州、河北、河南、湖南、山西等六个省的统计，约占总人口的70％—90％，其中河南、湖南两省达到99％。全国农村现有托儿组织三百六十九万个，据山西、河北、山东、四川、贵州、江西等六个省的统计，入托儿童占应入托儿童总数的60％—80％。农村妇产院、缝纫厂、制鞋厂、碾米厂、磨面厂等集体福利事业和社会服务事业，发展也很快。据辽宁、河北、山西等三省不完全统计，共有缝纫厂七万多个。山西晋南专区已基本解决缝衣问题。
    集体福利事业和社会服务事业的大量发展，使妇女不再为煮饭、带孩子、做衣服等家务事而操心，集中精力参加社会劳动，这就大大有助于我国妇女劳动力的彻底解放。1958年，全国约有五千五百万妇女，从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来，其中极大部分是农村妇女。这样一支巨大的队伍投入农村各项生产事业，有力地促进了农业生产的大跃进。
    人民公社化以后，广大妇女经过集体劳动和集体生活的锻炼，在党的教育下，她们的思想面貌发生了巨大的变化。过去，妇女们局限在家庭小圈子里，接触的是锅瓢碗盏，针针线线，因此，眼界不广，胸怀狭窄。现在，接触的是国家大事，因此，社会主义觉悟显著提高，集体观念和共产主义协作精神大大增强，党指向哪里就奔向那里。宁夏海原县城东拔海约两千米的牌楼山最高峰，被风雨侵蚀，草木不生，妇女们响应党的号召，苦战七十多天，植树二千多株，治理水土流失面积二千多亩，由于完成任务好，被命名为“三八”山。
    家务劳动社会化以后，广大妇女都努力学习文化，钻研技术，获得了显著成绩。1958年，全国一千六百万以上的妇女摆脱了文盲状态，其中极大部分是农村妇女。文化水平的提高，给钻研技术带来很多方便。目前，农村妇女普遍种大面积丰产田和试验田，人人学技术，个个搞革新，涌现了千千万万个红旗手、女生产能手和巧姑娘。
    妇女们参加了社会劳动，有了文化，掌握了技术，为祖国的社会主义事业作出了重大的贡献，这就使她们的社会地位大大提高。现在全国有许多优秀妇女被人民选举出来，担任各种基层领导工作。全国担任人民公社正副女社长的，据1959年9月的统计，有五千六百九十多人，所有生产队几乎都有女队长。
    公社化后，我国妇女在家庭的地位大大改变了，团结和睦的社会主义新家庭大量涌现。人民公社在分配方面，目前主要是实行按劳分配的工资制，同时实行部分的具有按需分配萌芽性质的供给制。供给制对于每一个男女社员来说，都是一项最重要的和最可靠的社会保险。而工资是直接发给每个劳动者的，妇女自己领到了工资。这就使妇女获得了经济上的独立，从而进一步破除了封建家长制的残余，使家庭生活更加幸福。团结和睦的新的家庭关系，又进一步促进了生产的发展。
