    Production Frontline Supply Competition
    (Our report) Since Chongqing Iron and Steel Company launched a new high tide of steel production competition, more than 1,000 employees of the Chongqing D渡口 Trade Store immediately prepared to take action, launching a competition upsurge of large-scale workshop supply.
    In order to ensure that frontline production workers eat enough, eat well, and eat economically, they tried every possible means to increase new varieties, supplying workers with popular and nutritious foods such as tofu pudding and bean dreg fritters. They also proactively understood the needs of the workers at any time and delivered items to the workers in a timely manner.
    Now, 32 supply and service networks and points have been established in Chongqing Iron and Steel's workshops and construction sites. In order to further cooperate with the production front, they concentrated manpower, divided up responsibilities, and ensured that "everyone at the furnace side is supplied and everyone likes it." Because they combined fixed supply with mobile supply, daily supply with condolence supply, and material supply with publicity and mobilization, they not only met the daily needs of the employees but also greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the steel warriors.

    生产前线赛供应
    本报讯　重庆钢铁公司掀起夺钢竞赛新高潮以后，重庆大渡口贸易商店的一千多名职工，立即整装上阵，掀起了大搞车间供应的竞赛热潮。
    他们为了保证第一线生产工人吃得饱、吃得好、吃得省，千方百计增加新品种，供应工人爱吃的、营养丰富的豆腐脑、豆渣麻花等。他们还随时主动地了解工人们的需要，及时把物品送到工人手里。
    现在，重钢的车间和工地上，已建立起供应和服务网、点三十二个。为了进一步配合生产战线，他们集中人力，划片包干，做到炉边供应“人人不落空，个个都喜欢”。由于他们实行固定供应与流动供应相结合，日常供应与慰问供应相结合，物质供应与宣传鼓动相结合，不仅满足了职工们日常生活的需要，还大大鼓舞了钢铁战士的生产热情。
