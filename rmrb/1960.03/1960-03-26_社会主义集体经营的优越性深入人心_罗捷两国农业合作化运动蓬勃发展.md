    The Superiority of Socialist Collective Management is Deeply Rooted
    Agricultural Cooperation Movements in Romania and Czechoslovakia are Flourishing
    The Romanian cooperative movement is developing rapidly. Currently, the number of farmers participating in cooperative organizations has increased to 75% of the country's total number of farmers. The production achievements of the socialist agricultural sector surpass those of individual farmers every year. In terms of wheat yield per unit area, state farms were 40% higher than individual farmers, and collective farms were 15% higher than individual farmers last year.
    The movement of agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia from small cooperatives to large cooperatives has recently experienced rapid development. 1,658 cooperatives across the country have been merged into 690 large cooperatives. The merged cooperatives have begun to show great advantages in improving agricultural production and promoting agricultural mechanization and specialization.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest. An editorial in the Romanian newspaper "New Agriculture" pointed out that the Romanian cooperative movement has developed greatly recently, and the number of farmers participating in cooperative organizations currently accounts for 75% of the country's total number of farmers.
    In an editorial commemorating the eleventh anniversary of the Romanian Workers' Party's resolution on agricultural cooperation, the newspaper stated that the socialist transformation of agriculture has always been the focus of the Party's attention. The Party organizations have carried out a great deal of work among the peasants. Since the Second Congress of the Workers' Party (1955), the agricultural cooperation movement has gained rapid development. By the end of 1959, the number of farmers participating in agricultural cooperative organizations accounted for 73.5% of the country's total number of farmers, and has now increased to 75%.
    The editorial said that the production achievements of the socialist agricultural sector surpass those of individual farmers every year. In 1959, in terms of wheat yield per unit area, state farms were 40% higher than individual farmers, and collective farms were 15% higher than individual farmers. The average yield of corn per unit area of individual farmers was 17% lower than that of the socialist agricultural sector.
    The editorial said that the grain, sunflower, and sugar beet produced by the socialist agricultural sector last year accounted for more than 70%, 75%, and 85% of the country's total output of grain, sunflower, and sugar beet, respectively. The agricultural products provided by the socialist agricultural sector account for a large proportion in the national central reserve, with wheat accounting for 75%, sunflower accounting for 66%, and sugar beet accounting for 88%. The task put forward by the Second Congress of the Workers' Party that socialist agriculture should occupy a dominant position in terms of land area and commodity products by 1960 has been completed ahead of schedule.
    The editorial said that while developing the socialist agricultural sector, the Party and the government also attach great importance to consolidating agricultural cooperative organizations economically and organizationally. Collective farms and co-farming societies receive a large number of improved seeds, livestock, fertilizers, tractors, and various agricultural machines from the state. In recent years, the income of collective farms has greatly increased due to signing purchase and sales contracts with the state.
    The editorial said that the socialist agricultural sector has great potential for increasing production. This is manifested in the high-yield records created last year of harvesting 150,000 kilograms of sugar beet or 140,000 kilograms of silage corn per hectare of land.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague. Our reporter reported: The movement of unified agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia from small cooperatives to large cooperatives has developed rapidly in the past two months. From January 1st to March 1st this year, 1,658 agricultural cooperatives across the country have been merged into 690 large cooperatives, with an average cultivated area of 800 hectares (15 Chinese acres per hectare) per cooperative.
    In the process of merging cooperatives, Czechoslovakian farmers have promoted the spirit of communist cooperation, and many wealthy cooperatives have voluntarily merged with poor cooperatives. Many members of wealthy cooperatives said that their personal income may be less in the short term, but because the combined strength is greater, the production of the entire large cooperative will soon increase to a level exceeding that of the original wealthy cooperative. For example, a cooperative named Kobile in the Tučim county of Karlovy Vary Region had a daily labor remuneration of 38 crowns (Czech currency) in 1958. After it merged with another poorer cooperative, although the remuneration per labor day was only 31 crowns in 1959, the members worked together to improve the production level, and the cooperative also accumulated a large amount of public reserve fund, which will be used for soil improvement and development of animal husbandry production. They regard the long-term interests of the large collective as higher than the immediate interests of individuals and small collectives.
    Most of the merged agricultural cooperatives form production teams based on the original cooperatives. Each production team can be responsible for planting certain types of crops and raising certain types of livestock based on its own conditions and strengths.
    The merged cooperatives have begun to show great advantages in improving agricultural production, promoting agricultural mechanization and specialization, improving labor productivity, and reducing heavy physical labor. For example, in the Olomouc Region, the merger of two cooperatives has brought benefits to this year's spring plowing. Because the original cooperative lacked labor but had eleven tractors, while the other cooperative had labor but only two tractors. After the two cooperatives merged, not only can the tractors be used more fully, but also three grain harvesters have been added, and better arrangements have been made in terms of manpower. Another example is that after three cooperatives in Bratislava Region merged into one large cooperative, it has 1,660 hectares of cultivated land, 433 dairy cows, and 2,200 pigs. This year, the members want to increase the total production value by one million crowns compared to last year. Among the original three cooperatives, one cooperative's members were good at planting hemp, and now they are helping members of the other two cooperatives improve hemp planting. In order to achieve the goal of milking 2,700 liters of milk per cow per year, the best breeders have been transferred to production teams with poor milk production (i.e., the cooperatives before the merger) to help raise dairy cows.
    The requirement for the merger of agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia was put forward by the masses last year when the countryside discussed the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) and studied how to rapidly improve agricultural production. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held in September last year, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, Novotny, put forward a call for merging cooperatives, which greatly promoted the work of merging cooperatives. The masses in various places linked their own experiences and widely and enthusiastically discussed the Party's suggestions, thus setting off a wave of enthusiasm for merging cooperatives.

    社会主义集体经营的优越性深入人心
    罗捷两国农业合作化运动蓬勃发展
    罗马尼亚合作化运动发展迅速，目前加入合作组织的农户已增加到全国农户的75％。社会主义农业部分所取得的生产成就每年都超过个体农民。就小麦的单位面积产量来说，去年国营农场比个体农民高40％，集体农庄比个体农民高15％。
    捷克斯洛伐克农业合作社由小社合并成大社的运动，近来有了迅速发展。全国已经有一千六百五十八个合作社合并成为六百九十个大型的合作社。合并后的合作社在提高农业生产、促进农业机械化与专业化等方面都开始显示了巨大的优越性。
    新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚“新农业报”的一篇社论指出，罗马尼亚合作化运动近来有很大发展，目前加入合作组织的农户已占全国农户的75％。
    这家报纸在为纪念罗马尼亚工人党发表关于农业合作化决议十一周年的社论中说，对农业进行社会主义改造始终是党所注意的中心。党组织在农民中进行了许多工作。从工人党第二次代表大会（1955年）以来，农业合作化运动获得了迅速的发展。到1959年底，加入农业合作组织的农户占全国农户的73．5％，而目前已增加到75％。
    社论说，社会主义农业部分所取得的生产成就每年都超过个体农民。在1959年，就小麦的单位面积产量来说，国营农场比个体农民高40％，集体农庄比个体农民高15％。个体农民的玉蜀黍平均单位面积产量比社会主义农业部分低17％。
    社论说，社会主义农业部分去年所生产的粮食、向日葵和甜菜分别占全国粮食、向日葵和甜菜总产量的70％、75％和85％以上。社会主义农业部分所提供的农产品在国家中央储备中占有极大比重，小麦占75％，向日葵占66％，甜菜占88％。工人党第二次代表大会所提出的到1960年社会主义农业在占有的土地面积和商品产品方面都要占优势地位的任务已经提前完成。
    社论说，在发展社会主义农业部分的同时，党和政府也很重视从经济上和组织上巩固农业合作组织。集体农庄和共耕社从国家得到大量的优良种子、牲畜、化肥、拖拉机和各种农业机器。近几年来，集体农庄由于同国家签定购销合同，所得到的收入有很大增加。
    社论说，社会主义农业部分有很大的增产潜力。这表现在，去年创造了在一公顷土地上收十五万公斤甜菜或十四万公斤青贮玉蜀黍的高产纪录。
    新华社布拉格电　本社记者报道：捷克斯洛伐克统一农业合作社由小社合并成大社的运动，近两个月来有了迅速的发展。从今年1月1日到3月1日，全国已经有一千六百五十八个农业合作社合并成为六百九十个大型的合作社，每个合作社的耕地面积平均达到八百公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。
    在并社过程中，捷克斯洛伐克农民发扬了共产主义协作精神，许多富社自愿和穷社合并。很多富社的社员说，在短时期内他们个人的收入可能会少一些，但是由于联合起来的力量大，在不久的将来，整个大社的生产将提高到超过原有的富社的水平。例如，卡罗维发利州图齐姆县的一个名叫科比列的合作社，1958年社内每个劳动日报酬达三十八克朗（捷币），当它和另一个较穷的合作社合并后，虽然在1959年每个劳动日的报酬只有三十一克朗，但是社员们同心协力把生产水平提高了，而且社内还积存了一大笔公积金，这笔资金将用于土壤改良和发展畜牧业生产。他们把长远的大集体利益，看得高于个人和小集体的眼前利益。
    合并后的农业合作社大都以原来的合作社为单位组成生产队。各生产队可以根据本身的条件和特长，分工负责种植某些种类的农作物和饲养某些种类的牲畜。
    合并后的合作社在提高农业生产、促进农业机械化与专业化、提高劳动生产率、减轻繁重体力劳动等方面都开始显示了巨大的优越性。例如，在阿罗木次州有两个合作社合并以后，就给今年春耕带来了好处。因为原来的一个合作社缺乏劳动力，但有十一台拖拉机；而另外一个合作社有劳动力，但只有两台拖拉机。两个社合并以后，不但可以更加充分地使用拖拉机，而且还添置了三架谷物收割机，在人力方面也作了更好的安排。再如布拉迪斯拉发州有三个合作社合并成一个大社后，拥有耕地一千六百六十公顷，奶牛四百三十三头，猪二千二百头。今年社员们要把生产总值比去年提高一百万克朗。在原来的三个合作社中，有一个社的社员擅长种植大麻，现在他们正帮助另外两个社的社员改进大麻的种植。为了实现每头奶牛每年挤奶二千七百公升的指标，最好的饲养员已被调到产奶较差的生产队（即合并前的社）去帮助饲养奶牛。
    捷克斯洛伐克农业合作社合并的要求，是在去年农村讨论第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）和研究如何迅速提高农业生产的时候由群众提出的。在去年9月举行的捷共中央全体会议上，捷共中央第一书记、共和国总统诺沃提尼提出了关于并社的号召，这大大促进了并社的工作。各地群众联系切身的体会，广泛而热烈地讨论了党的建议，从而掀起了并社的热潮。
