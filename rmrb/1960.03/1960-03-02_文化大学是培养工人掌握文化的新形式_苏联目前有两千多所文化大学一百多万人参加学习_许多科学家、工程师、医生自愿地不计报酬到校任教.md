     Cultural Universities are a New Form for Workers to Master Culture
     The Soviet Union Currently Has Over Two Thousand Cultural Universities with Over One Million Participants
     Many Scientists, Engineers, and Doctors Voluntarily Teach at the Schools Without Remuneration
    The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on February 28th entitled "Cultural Universities." The following is an abstract of the editorial:
    Cultural universities are one of the new forms of communist education for the working people. Like the Communist Labor Brigades, People's Patrols, and People's Theaters, cultural universities are the product of a new historical period in the life of our motherland—the period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction, that is, when the Soviet people are excitedly and enthusiastically striving to realize the magnificent tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Cultural universities were established based on the initiative of the people and are the result of the people's creation. All the main teaching and organizational work in these cultural universities is undertaken by activists who are enthusiastic about social work, and they contribute a great deal of effort, energy, and initiative to this cause.
    Currently, there are over two thousand cultural universities of various types in the Soviet Union. Over one million people attend classes. Among those attending cultural universities are many workers. For example, in the Sverdlovsk Oblast, workers account for more than 60% of the total number of students, in Leningrad 45%, and in universities established in enterprises, the number of workers attending classes reaches 80%.
    The task of cultural universities is to impart systematic knowledge in music, drama, fine arts, literature, science, and technology to the students. It is an important means of aesthetic education for workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, and it contributes to the communist education of the masses, helps cultivate the communist morality of the Soviet people, and actively promotes the cultivation of well-rounded individuals—active builders of communism.
    All the educational work of cultural universities should be closely linked with the struggle of the Soviet people for peace, for the building of communism, and for the completion of the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy.
    In the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee "On the Tasks of Party Propaganda in Modern Conditions," it is stated that we must unremittingly devote ourselves to improving the ideological level of various forms of mass propaganda, and cultural universities are one of these forms. However, the teaching programs of many cultural universities mostly contain topics discussing the distant past, pay little attention to the achievements of Soviet science and technology and the creations of modern writers and artists, and rarely study works that can help to more deeply understand our socialist reality. Admittedly, it is necessary to study the history of cultural development; otherwise, one cannot truly understand the present. However, it must be noted that cultural universities are not specialized educational institutions, where ancient and medieval art are studied in detail. The teaching programs of cultural universities should focus more on the present than on the past.
    Another serious shortcoming in the work of some cultural universities is that they indulge in various recreational things in the name of "decoration." Some places are overly fond of holding lectures on everyday life topics: how to cook, how to dress, how to choose gifts, and so on. The coursework in cultural universities should not be seen merely as a means of recreation and entertainment. In order not to betray the lofty name of cultural universities, and in order to achieve the goals they have set, they should first of all become people's educational institutions, so that students can obtain systematic knowledge to a greater or lesser extent on the subjects they have chosen. We must strive to make cultural universities promote the propaganda of communist ideas and promote the education of new people.
    Many scientists, engineers, doctors, teachers, actors, and writers enthusiastically, without remuneration, and voluntarily work in cultural universities. In the Moscow People's Night University alone, 215 academicians, doctors, professors, associate professors, and candidate doctors have expressed their willingness to teach without remuneration. However, many cultural universities still lack skilled teachers. Creative institutions such as the Soviet Composers' Association, the Soviet Writers' Association, the Soviet Artists' Association, and the All-Russian Theater Association have not fully and actively participated in the work of cultural universities. There is no systematic guidance work for teachers. Cultural universities are social in nature. Their vitality and the source of their popularity lie here. While giving play to social initiative, we must also help and lead it.
    Party organizations should regularly delve into the work of cultural universities, help them prepare teaching plans and teaching programs, and improve the ideological level of their work. Doing our best to assist the Soviet people in mastering the treasures of science, technology, literature, and art is an extremely important responsibility of our Party, government, and social organizations.

     文化大学是培养工人掌握文化的新形式
     苏联目前有两千多所文化大学一百多万人参加学习
     许多科学家、工程师、医生自愿地不计报酬到校任教
    苏联“真理报”2月28日以“文化大学”为题发表了社论。社论摘要如下：
    文化大学是劳动人民共产主义教育的新形式之一。像共产主义劳动队、人民纠察队、人民剧团一样，文化大学是产生在我们祖国生活中的新的历史时期——全面展开共产主义建设时期，即当苏联人民兴奋鼓舞地努力实现苏共二十一次代表大会所提出的宏伟的任务的时候。文化大学是根据人民群众的倡议开始建立的，而且是人民创造的成果。这些文化大学中的全部主要的教学和组织工作都是由热心于社会工作的积极分子担任的，他们对这一事业贡献了许多力量、精力和主动精神。
    现在，苏联有两千多所各种类型的文化大学。有一百多万人来上课。在文化大学听课的人中有许多工人。例如，在斯维德洛夫斯克州工人占听课总人数的60％以上，在列宁格勒占45％，而在企业中所建立的大学中，工人听课人数达到80％。
    文化大学的任务是向学员讲授一定程度的音乐、戏剧、造型艺术、文学、科学技术等方面的系统知识。它是对工人、集体农民和知识分子进行美学教育的重要手段，它有助于群众的共产主义教育，有助于培养苏联人民的共产主义道德风尚，积极地促进了培养全面发展的人——共产主义的积极建设者。
    文化大学的全部教育工作应该同苏联人民为争取和平、为建成共产主义、为完成发展国民经济的七年计划而进行的斗争极其密切地联系起来。
    在苏共中央“关于在现代条件下党的宣传的任务”的决议中说，必须坚持不懈地致力于提高多种形式的群众宣传的思想水平，而文化大学便是这些形式里边的一种。可是，许多文化大学的教学大纲中大都是一些论述遥远过去的题材，很少注意研究苏联科学技术的成就和现代作家、艺术家的创作，很少研究能够帮助更深入地理解我们社会主义现实的那些作品。诚然，研究文化发展史是必要的，否则，便不能真正理解现代。但是，必须注意到文化大学并不是专门的教育机关，在那些专门的教育机关才详尽地研究古代和中古的艺术。文化大学的教学大纲应当更多地着眼于现在，而不是着眼于过去。
    某些文化大学的工作中的另一个严重缺点是：以“装饰”为名，陶醉于种种消遣性的东西。有的地方过份陶醉于举办以日常生活为题的讲座：怎样做饭，怎样打扮，怎样选择礼品等等。文化大学里的课业不应当只看做是消遣娱乐的手段。为了不辜负文化大学的崇高名称，为了达到它们所提出的目标，它们应当首先成为人民的教育机关，使学员能够就他们所选择的课目或多或少地得到系统知识。必须努力使文化大学促进共产主义思想的宣传，促进对新人的教育。
    许多科学家、工程师、医生、教师、演员、作家兴致勃勃地、无报酬地、自愿地在文化大学工作。仅仅在莫斯科人民夜大学，就有二百一十五位科学院士、博士、教授、副教授、候补博士表示愿意无报酬地担任教学工作。不过，许多文化大学仍然缺乏熟练的教师。像苏联作曲家协会、苏联作家协会、苏联美术家协会、全俄罗斯戏剧家协会等创作机构还没有充分积极地参加文化大学的工作。没有对教师进行系统的指导工作。文化大学是社会性质的工作。它们的生命力和大众化的泉源就在这里。发挥社会主动精神同时必须帮助它和领导它。
    党组织应经常地深入到文化大学的工作中去，帮助它编制教学计划和教学大纲，提高它们的工作的思想水平。尽力协助苏联人民掌握科学技术和文学艺术宝藏，是我们党、政府和社会团体极其重要的职责。
