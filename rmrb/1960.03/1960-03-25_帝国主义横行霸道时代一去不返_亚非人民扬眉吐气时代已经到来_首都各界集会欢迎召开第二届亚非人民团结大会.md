Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: More than one thousand people from all walks of life in the capital solemnly held a meeting this afternoon to warmly welcome and support the upcoming Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, reflecting the strong aspirations of 1.7 billion Asian and African people, will be held in mid-April in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. Today's meeting passed a resolution, wishing the conference new contributions to further promoting the Bandung spirit, strengthening the unity of the Asian and African people, promoting the national independence movement, and safeguarding the cause of world peace. The resolution also emphasized: "In the common struggle against imperialism and in the cause of developing national economies, the Chinese people will always be closely united with and support the people of Asian and African countries."

The meeting was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Two years ago, people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting here to celebrate the great victory achieved by the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. Today, people from all walks of life in the capital responded to the call of the Asian-African Solidarity Council to hold a day in support of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, once again holding a meeting here to express the full support of the 650 million Chinese people for the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism, against colonialism, and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence. Li Dequan, vice chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, pointed out in his opening remarks that in the past two years, we have been pleased to see that the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries, especially the African people, against imperialism, against colonialism, and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence has developed rapidly and vigorously, and has continuously achieved new victories. New independent countries are emerging one after another on the African continent, and the rule of colonialism has reached the end of its rope, on its last gasps. However, the forces of war and aggression headed by the United States are not reconciled to their defeat and are still doing everything possible to carry out a last-ditch struggle. While continuing armed threats, subversion and sabotage, they have also adopted many new tricks of political deception and economic wooing, attempting to obstruct and disintegrate the national independence movement of the Asian and African people. Under this new situation, the convening of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is of particularly important significance.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. He said that the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will be held from April 11th to 15th in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the convening of this conference and sincerely wish the conference success. He said: We believe that the holding of the conference will further develop and consolidate the friendly unity of the Asian and African people in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and further encourage and promote the victorious advance of the African national independence movement. This not only conforms to the strong aspirations of the 1.7 billion Asian and African people, but also conforms to the common interests of the people of the world in opposing imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace.

Liao Chengzhi said that since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo in early 1958, the Asian-African people's solidarity movement has made remarkable progress, and the struggle of the Asian and African countries' people against imperialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence has continued to rise and has achieved greater and greater victories.

Liao Chengzhi said that in order to smash the new conspiracies of imperialism, the Asian and African people must further strengthen their unity. Asian-African solidarity is the fundamental guarantee for the liberation of the Asian and African people. Imperialism is very hostile to Asian-African solidarity, and they are provoking discord everywhere, spreading disharmony, and doing everything possible to undermine this unity. The purpose of doing so is to shift the struggle goals of the Asian and African people, isolate the Asian and African countries from each other, lose mutual support, so that they can be defeated one by one. The more imperialism wants to undermine Asian-African solidarity, the more it makes the Asian and African people realize the preciousness of Asian-African solidarity, and strive to maintain this unity. The tortuous development of the past year shows that Asian-African solidarity can withstand the test and cannot be destroyed by any force. Among the Asian and African countries, as long as everyone adopts a friendly and mutually accommodating attitude and adheres to the method of peaceful consultation, there is no problem that cannot be fairly and reasonably resolved. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, unlike what some people say are already "outdated" or have "withered", on the contrary, the spirit of the Five Principles, with the passage of time, shows its great vitality even more. The Asian and African countries' people must always recognize our common enemy, clarify our struggle goals, and spare no effort to consolidate and develop our great unity, and push the cause of liberation of the Asian and African people to a higher stage. This is the fundamental interest of the Asian and African people.

Liao Chengzhi said: The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Asian and African people as their own struggle, and are infinitely excited about every victory of theirs. In the struggle against imperialism and safeguarding peace, the Chinese people will always stand with the Asian and African people! Liao Chengzhi's speech was warmly welcomed.

Then, Liu Changsheng, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Shi Liang, vice chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Li Menghua, vice chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting successively. They respectively represented the workers, women and youth of China to warmly welcome and support the upcoming Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and wished the conference a complete success.

Liu Changsheng said: The Chinese workers and people are extremely excited about the development of the national democratic movement in Asian and African countries. The Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries share weal and woe together. We have a common experience of being oppressed by imperialism for a long time. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries as their own struggle, and their victory as their own victory. Due to the joint efforts of the strength of the socialist camp, the strength of the national democratic movement and the strength of defending peace in the world, the entire international situation is developing in a direction more conducive to peace. The struggle of the Asian and African people to strive for and defend national independence and democratic freedom is invincible. Although the imperialists are still making desperate struggles and constantly using new conspiracies and tricks, no method can save it from its inevitable death. We believe that under the encouragement of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the people of Asian and African countries will further unite, hold higher the banner of peace and anti-imperialism, and advance together with the people all over the world, from victory to victory. He shouted: Long live the unity of the Asian and African workers and people.

Shi Liang said: Our Chinese women and all the people have consistently supported the just struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against the imperialist forces headed by the United States, and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence and democracy. Although imperialism is trying its best to undermine our unity with the people of Asian and African countries, under the guidance of the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, the unity of 1.7 billion Asian and African people and women can withstand the test and is unshakable. The principles of peaceful coexistence and the Bandung spirit will not only diminish, but will surely be further carried forward. We believe that the convening of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will further strengthen the close unity of the Asian and African people and women. The Asian and African people will hold high the banner of opposing imperialism and striving for independence and freedom, and move from victory to victory. She cheered: Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people and women.

In his speech, Li Menghua, on behalf of the 130 million youths of China, paid high tribute to the people and youths of Asian and African countries who are heroically struggling for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence and against imperialism, and wished them greater victories in their struggles. He said that the current international situation is very favorable to the national democratic movement of the Asian and African countries. The era of imperialism's high-handedness and doing whatever it wants is gone forever, and the era of the Asian and African countries' people holding their heads high has arrived. Of course, there will still be arduous and tortuous struggles on the road ahead for the Asian and African people, but the just cause of the Asian and African countries' people against imperialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence will surely achieve final victory. The Chinese people and the Chinese youth are always the loyal friends of the people and youth of Asian and African countries. The Chinese youth resolutely support the just struggle of the people and youth of Asian and African countries. Let us unite as one, persist in the struggle, and send imperialism to the grave.

The meeting finally unanimously passed a resolution, expressing firm support and heartfelt congratulations to the convening of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. When the resolution was passed, the audience burst into thunderous applause, which lasted for a long time.

Today's meeting was jointly sponsored by the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Association of the People's Republic of China, and the All-China Youth Federation. Attending today's meeting were Chen Shutong, vice chairman and members of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, members of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, heads of relevant organizations, and heads of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Women's Federation, and Youth Federation.

Hwang Bong-koo, a Korean peace activist in Beijing, Khair, a Sudanese peace activist, Toshio Oide, head of the visiting delegation of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, and other foreign guests, peace activists and students from Asian and African countries in Beijing, were invited to attend the meeting.

    帝国主义横行霸道时代一去不返  亚非人民扬眉吐气时代已经到来
    首都各界集会欢迎召开第二届亚非人民团结大会
    据新华社24日讯　首都各界人民一千多人今天下午隆重举行集会，热烈欢迎和支持即将召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会。
    反映十七亿亚非人民强烈愿望的第二届亚非人民团结大会，将于4月中旬在几内亚首都科纳克里举行。今天大会通过决议，预祝大会对进一步发扬万隆精神，加强亚非人民的团结，促进民族独立运动以及保卫世界和平的事业作出新的贡献。决议还强调指出：“在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中和发展民族经济的事业中，中国人民将永远同亚非各国人民紧密团结相互支援。”
    大会在政协礼堂举行。两年以前，首都各界人民为庆祝第一届亚非人民团结大会所取得的巨大胜利，曾经在这里举行了盛大的集会。今天，首都各界人民又响应亚非团结理事会关于举行支持第二届亚非人民团结大会日的号召，再一次在这里举行集会，表示六亿五千万中国人民对亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义及争取和维护民族独立斗争的全力支持。中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全在致开幕词中指出，两年以来，我们高兴地看到，亚非各国人民，特别是非洲人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争有了迅速蓬勃的发展，并且接连不断地取得了新的胜利。新的独立国家一个接着一个地在非洲大陆上出现，殖民主义的统治已到了日薄西山，奄奄一息的境地，但是以美国为首的战争侵略势力并不甘心于他们的失败，仍在千方百计地进行垂死挣扎。他们在继续武装威胁、颠覆破坏的同时，又采取许多政治欺骗和经济拉拢的新花样，妄图阻挠和瓦解亚非人民的民族独立运动。在这种新的形势下，第二届亚非人民团结大会的召开是具有特别重要的意义的。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在大会上作了重要讲话。他说，第二届亚非人民团结大会将要在4月11日至15日在几内亚首都科纳克里召开。中国人民热烈欢迎和支持这次大会的召开，衷心预祝这次大会的成功。他说：我们相信，大会的举行，必将进一步发展和巩固亚非人民在反对帝国主义、殖民主义的共同斗争中的友好团结，进一步鼓舞和推动非洲民族独立运动的胜利前进。这不仅符合十七亿亚非人民的强烈愿望，同时也符合全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的共同利益。
    廖承志说，自从1958年初在开罗举行的第一届亚非人民团结大会以来，亚非人民团结运动有了显著的发展，亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，不断高涨，并且取得了越来越大的胜利。
    廖承志说，为了粉碎帝国主义的新阴谋，亚非人民必须进一步加强团结。亚非团结是亚非人民争取解放的根本保证。帝国主义十分仇视亚非团结，它们到处挑拨离间，散布不和，千方百计地企图破坏这种团结。它们这样做的目的是要转移亚非人民的斗争目标，使亚非国家彼此孤立起来，失去相互支持，以便于它们各个击破。帝国主义越是要破坏亚非团结，就越使得亚非人民认识亚非团结的可贵，并且努力去维护这种团结。过去一年的曲折发展，说明亚非团结是经得起考验的，是任何力量都破坏不了的。在亚非国家间，只要大家采取友好互让的态度，坚持和平协商的方法，就没有什么问题不可以得到公平合理的解决。和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，不仅不像某些人所说的已经“过时”或者已经“枯萎”了，相反地，五项原则的精神随着时间的推移，却更加显示出它伟大的生命力。亚非各国人民必须永远认准我们的共同敌人，明确我们的斗争目标，不遗余力地巩固和发展我们的伟大团结，把亚非人民的解放事业推向一个更高的阶段，这是亚非人民的根本利益所在。
    廖承志说：中国人民从来都把亚非人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，对于他们的每一个胜利都感到无限的兴奋。在反对帝国主义、维护和平的斗争中，中国人民将永远同亚非人民站在一起！廖承志的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    接着，全国总工会副主席刘长胜、全国妇联副主席史良和全国青联副主席李梦华先后在会上讲话。他们分别代表中国的工人、妇女和青年热烈欢迎和支持即将召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会，祝大会圆满成功。
    刘长胜说：中国的工人和人民对于亚非各国民族民主运动的发展感到无比的兴奋。中国人民和亚、非各国人民是同甘苦共患难的，我们有着长期受帝国主义压迫的共同遭遇。中国人民从来就把亚、非各国人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看成是自己的胜利。由于社会主义阵营的力量，民族民主运动的力量以及全世界保卫和平的力量的共同努力，整个国际形势正在朝着更有利于和平的方向发展。亚、非人民争取和捍卫民族独立和民主自由的斗争是不可战胜的。尽管帝国主义者还在作绝望的挣扎，不断施展新的阴谋伎俩，但是，任何办法也挽救不了它必然死亡的命运。我们相信：在第二届亚非人民团结大会的鼓舞下，亚非各国人民一定会更进一步团结起来，更高地举起和平、反帝的旗帜，同世界各地人民一同前进，从胜利走向胜利。他高呼：亚非工人和人民的团结万岁。
    史良说：我们中国妇女和全体人民一道一贯支持亚非各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义势力，争取和维护民族独立与民主的正义斗争，尽管帝国主义千方百计地企图破坏我们和亚非各国人民的团结，但是在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则的精神指导下，亚非十七亿人民和妇女的团结是经得起考验的，是不可动摇的。和平共处的原则和万隆精神不仅不会减退，而且必将更加发扬光大。我们相信，第二届亚非人民团结大会的召开必将进一步加强亚非人民和妇女的紧密团结，亚非人民将高高地举起反对帝国主义，争取独立和自由的旗帜，从胜利走向胜利。她欢呼亚非人民和妇女大团结万岁。
    李梦华在讲话中，代表全中国一亿三千万青年向正在为争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义而英勇斗争的亚非各国人民和青年致以崇高的敬意，并祝他们在斗争中取得更大的胜利。他说，目前的国际形势十分有利于亚非各国人民的民族民主运动。帝国主义横行霸道、为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了，亚非各国人民扬眉吐气的时代已经来到了。当然，在亚非人民前进的道路上还会有艰巨和曲折的斗争，但是亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的正义事业一定会取得最后的胜利。中国人民和中国青年永远是亚非各国人民和青年的忠实朋友。中国青年坚决支持亚非各国人民和青年的正义斗争。让我们团结一致、坚持斗争，把帝国主义送到坟墓里去。
    大会最后一致通过决议，对第二届亚非人民团结大会的召开表示坚决的支持和衷心祝贺。在通过决议的时候，全场掌声雷动，经久不息。
    今天的大会是由中国亚非团结委员会，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，中华全国总工会，中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会，中华全国青年联合会联合主办的。出席今天大会的，有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通和委员，中国亚非团结委员会的委员，各有关团体的负责人和北京市工会、妇联、青联的负责人等。
    在北京的朝鲜和平人士黄凤九，苏丹和平人士凯尔，日本全递信工会访华代表团团长大出俊，以及其他在北京的亚非国家的外宾、和平人士和留学生，都应邀出席了大会。（附图片）
