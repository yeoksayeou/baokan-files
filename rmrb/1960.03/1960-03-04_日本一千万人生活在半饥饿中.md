According to officially released Japanese materials, about ten million people throughout Japan last year had incomes insufficient to maintain even a minimum standard of living. In Tokyo, one-seventh of the residents live in semi-starvation.

	Subsisting on Small Fish and Wild Vegetables

In the coal mining areas of Kyushu and Hokkaido, due to mass layoffs by capitalists, many unemployed workers can only scavenge for coal scraps in abandoned mines, earning only 50 or 60 yen a day. Some people can only subsist on catching small fish and picking wild vegetables.

	The Blood and Tears of Blood Sellers

The number of people making a living by selling blood is increasing in Japan.

However, the price of blood is so meager that it is simply not enough to make ends meet. Due to excessive blood selling and malnutrition, the health of blood sellers continues to deteriorate. According to a recent report in the "Asahi Shimbun," the blood specific gravity of 46.8% of professional blood sellers is already substandard, and 13.2% of them have lost the condition of normal people.

	Embarking on the Path of Suicide

Driven by poverty, many people have embarked on the path of suicide. Last year alone, there were 20,400 suicides nationwide in Japan.

In Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture, 38-year-old carpenter Wataru Inoue, due to being heavily in debt and unable to make a living, strangled his wife, son, and two daughters on January 8th, then committed suicide by taking poison.

On January 25th, two drunk men were frozen to death in downtown Tokyo. One of them was an elderly man who collected scraps. He used his meager change to have a "good drink," then sat next to his scrap basket, using freezing to death to "escape" his miserable life.

	The Suffering of the New Generation

Among those who commit suicide, the proportion of students is the highest. Kyoto University has the highest suicide rate among schools nationwide. Last year, 105 students at this university attempted suicide. In recent years, an average of 25 out of every 1,000 students at the school have contemplated suicide.

According to education professionals, the primary reason for student suicide is the difficulty graduates face finding employment and the inability of working students to find work.

    日本一千万人生活在半饥饿中
    据日本官方公布的材料，去年全日本约有一千万人的收入不足以维持最起码的生活。在东京，有七分之一的居民生活在半饥饿中。
    靠小鱼和野菜充饥
    在九州和北海道煤矿区，由于资本家大批解雇，很多失业工人只能到一些废矿上拣拾煤块，一天的收入不过五、六十日元。有的人只能靠打小鱼和摘野菜充饥。
    卖血者的血泪
    靠卖血为生的人，在日本越来越多了。
    但是血液的代价是这样微薄，根本不足糊口。由于卖血过多，营养不良，卖血者的健康不断恶化。据“朝日新闻”最近的报道，在职业卖血者中，有46．8％的人的血液比重已经不合格，其中有13．2％的人已经失去了正常人的状态。
    走上自杀的道路
    在贫困的逼迫下，不少人走上了自杀之途。去年一年里，日本全国自杀者达二万零四百人。
    在兵库县姬路市，三十八岁的木工井上渡，由于欠债累累和生活无着，在1月8日勒死了自己的妻子、儿子和两个女儿，然后服毒自杀了。
    1月25日，在东京市中心有两名醉汉被冻死。其中一名是拾废品的老人，他用仅有的零钱“痛饮”了一番，然后就坐在装废品篓旁边，以冻死来“摆脱”苦难的生活。
    新生一代的苦难
    在自杀者中间，学生的比例最高。京都大学是全国学校中自杀比率最高的一个。去年，这个大学有一百零五名学生企图自杀。近几年，该校平均每一千名学生中就有二十五人想自杀。
    据教育界人士说，学生自杀的首要原因是：毕业生就业难和工读学生找不到工作做。
