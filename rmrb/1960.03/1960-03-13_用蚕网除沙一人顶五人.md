In Sichuan's Yanting, Anyue, Lezhi and other counties, the masses are being mobilized to weave silkworm nets, establish net factories, and prepare materials for silkworm raising by popularizing the use of silkworm nets for sand removal during the silkworm season.

The silkworm raising season is also a time of extremely busy agricultural production. As farmers say, "When silkworms mature, wheat turns yellow, and rice seedlings joint," this illustrates the tense situation of concurrent agricultural and silkworm raising work. In order to save labor and support agriculture, and to raise silkworms well, many people's communes are vigorously weaving silkworm nets to facilitate the use of silkworm nets for sand removal in the future.

Silkworm nets are tools for removing sand during silkworm raising. Small silkworm nets are used for sand removal during the first to third instars of the silkworms, and large silkworm nets are used for the fourth to fifth instars.

Using silkworm nets for sand removal frees silkworm raisers from the tedious and repetitive manual labor of the past, allowing them to feed the silkworms even better. Using silkworm nets for sand removal improves work efficiency by at least five times compared to the past.

    用蚕网除沙一人顶五人
    四川盐亭、安岳、乐至等县在大力发动群众编制蚕网，筹办网厂，为蚕期大搞养蚕除沙蚕网化作好物质准备。
    养蚕时间，也是农业生产活动极其繁忙的时候。农民说的“蚕老麦黄秧上节”、“秋蚕开始收割忙”，正说明了农业和养蚕逗工的紧张状况。为着节约劳动力支援农业，养好蚕儿，许多人民公社正大力编制蚕网，便于今后用蚕网除沙。
    蚕网是养蚕除沙的工具。蚕儿一至三龄除沙用小蚕网，四至五龄用大蚕网。
    蚕网除沙，解除了养蚕员们过去重复繁琐的手工劳动，可以把蚕儿喂得更好。蚕网除沙，至少比过去提高工效五倍以上。
