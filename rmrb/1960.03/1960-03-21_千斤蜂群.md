    Thousand-Jin Bee Colony
    By our reporter Tu Zhengfeng
    The high-yield trial group of the beekeeping production team of the Zhaiqi People's Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, last year verified that ten bee colonies (ten frames per colony) produced more than 14,100 jin of commercial honey in seven months (March to September), with an average of six times the number of bees per colony, producing more than 1,410 jin of honey, and 18 jin of wax. They achieved high yields in bees, honey, and wax.
    "Cooperativization"
    More queen bees mean more eggs, and more bees mean stronger colonies. Strong colonies gather honey, and more wax is produced. But how to achieve this? Although beekeeper Jiang Xiaomao was enthusiastic and had many years of beekeeping experience, his educational level was not high, and he could not understand many scientific beekeeping documents. With the cooperation of beekeeper Xu Beicheng (a high school student), they studied the advanced experiences of beekeeping in the Soviet Union and domestically, and compiled "Key Points for Bee Colony Management," making the scientific management of bee colonies more specific.
    How to make the queen bee lay more eggs? In early spring, they paid attention to strengthening the insulation of the bee colony, which accelerated the early breeding of the bee colony. In order to breed good queen bees, they adopted the method of diligent feeding and two larval grafting queen rearing methods. Therefore, when Zhejiang was still plagued by cold waves, the survival rate of queen rearing could reach more than 90%. During the honey flow period, in order to accelerate the breeding of bees, they organized strong colonies to collect honey. In early spring, February, they began to organize the ten bee colonies in the entire field into groups of two or three. The division of labor for the three bee colonies was as follows: the Jia group, with the largest number of bees in a double-queen strong colony, focused on honey collection; the Yi group, with a larger number of bees in a single-queen strong colony, focused on breeding. The Bing group was weaker, so they adopted the method of extracting egg honeycombs without bees attached and placing them in the Jia group, which had more bees and a higher nest temperature, to incubate them. This increased the number of new bees in the Jia group, which promoted an increase in honey-collecting bees. On the other hand, after extracting the brood honeycombs from the Bing group, they supplemented the nest honeycombs, which further stimulated the enthusiasm of the queen bee to lay eggs. Since the Bing group only laid eggs and was not responsible for incubating young bees, the Bing group did not weaken due to the aging and death of worker bees. Furthermore, the Jia group extracted pupal honeycombs that were about to emerge from the cells to supplement the Bing group, so that both the Jia and Bing groups developed rapidly on the basis of division of labor and cooperation.
    Through organization, the bees divided and cooperated, greatly exerting the breeding and production capacity of the bee colony for honey and wax, achieving strong colonies with sufficient food throughout the year, bee proliferation every period, and honey harvest every season.
    "Chasing Flowers and Seizing Honey"
    To achieve high yields in bees, honey, and wax, the first requirement is sufficient honey source conditions. While everyone was celebrating the Spring Festival, Jiang Xiaomao shouldered a travel bag and went to various places to investigate honey sources. In the past, when beekeepers investigated honey sources and arranged beekeeping locations, they first considered whether it was convenient for their own lives, and then considered whether the honey source was sufficient. "If you want high yields but are afraid of hardship, that won't work!" Jiang Xiaomao reminded himself as if he were blaming himself, he must change the past habit of only using plains, and only grazing bees along transportation routes in the plains. He was determined to face the mountains, go deep into the plains, and scatter bee colonies to improve honey collection. Jiang Xiaomao went deep into various places in this way, learning about crop planting from local people; then, he summarized this information to arrange a plan for the year's bee transhumance. When grazing bees, he also paid special attention to grasping the seasonal plan, accurately grasping the flowering and honey flow time of crops, and ensuring that the bees would never be separated from the flowers in a continuous, interlocked manner. For example, when collecting Chinese tallow flowers in Fuyuanwu, Xindeng Wanshi, Jiang Xiaomao and other comrades first conducted a detailed observation in this mountain village and found that the Chinese tallow forests on the mountains and in the valleys were very scattered, and the flowering was inconsistent. The Chinese tallow trees facing south and the sun were in full bloom; the Chinese tallow trees facing north and receiving less sunlight were budding. They decided to "scatter the bee colonies," dividing the original one field into seven fields. Furthermore, they gradually moved from the valley entrance where the Chinese tallow flowers flowed earlier to the valley bottom where the honey flow was later, extending the honey collection period and promoting the increase in bees, honey, and wax.
    Note: One frame, that is, one "comb foundation," is a base of beehives with six thousand interconnected hexagons. As long as the bees secrete beeswax on this artificially pressed "comb foundation" and raise the base, it becomes a beehive, that is, a "honeycomb." The queen bee lays eggs on the honeycomb, and the honeycomb with eggs is called a brood honeycomb, which is further divided into egg honeycombs, larval honeycombs, and sealed pupal honeycombs.

    千斤蜂群
    本报记者　屠正峰
    浙江省桐庐县窄溪人民公社养蜂生产队高产试验组，去年早春核定的十群蜂（每群十框），在七个月中（3月至9月）共产商品蜜一万四千一百多斤，平均每群蜂繁殖了六倍，产蜜一千四百一十多斤，产蜡十八斤。获得了蜂、蜜、蜡三高产。
    “合作化”
    蜂王多，产卵就多，蜂多群势强，强群采蜜，蜡也就多。但怎样实现呢？养蜂员江小毛虽然干劲足，有多年的养蜂经验，但是他的文化水平不高，许多科学的养蜂文献看不懂；在养蜂员徐北成（高中学生）的合作下，他们学习了苏联和国内的各种养蜂的先进经验，并且编写出“蜂群管理要点”，使科学管理蜂群更具体化了。
    怎样使蜂王多产卵？他们在早春就注意加强蜂群保温，加速了蜂群的提前繁殖。为了育好蜂王，采取了勤奖饲和两次移虫的育王方法，因而当浙江地区还在寒流侵袭的时候，育王的成活率能达到90％以上。在流蜜期，为了加速蜜蜂的繁殖，他们组织强群采蜜。在早春2月，就开始把全场十群蜂以两群或三群为一组地组织起来。三群蜜蜂的分工是这样的：用蜜蜂最多的双王强群为甲群，以采蜜为主；蜜蜂较多的单王强群为乙群，以繁殖为主。丙群较弱，采取抽出没有蜜蜂附着的卵脾，放到蜂多巢温较高的甲群去孵化，这样增加了甲群的新蜂，促使采蜜蜂增多。另一方面在丙群抽出子脾后，补进巢脾，也进一步发挥了蜂王产卵的积极性。由于丙群只产卵，不负孵化幼蜂的工作，使丙群不因工蜂衰老死亡而减弱群势，又在甲群抽出孵化到即将揭盖出房的蛹脾来补助丙群，使甲丙两群在分工协作的基础上都迅速地发展起来。
    通过组织起来，使蜜蜂分工协作，大大地发挥了蜂群繁殖和生产蜜、蜡的能力，达到了全年强群足食，期期蜂增殖，季季蜜丰收。
    “追花夺蜜”
    要使蜂、蜜、蜡三高产，首先要有充足的蜜源条件。江小毛在大家欢度春节的时候，就背起旅行包到各地去调查蜜源。过去的养蜂员，在调查蜜源和安排放蜂地点时，首先考虑的是，那里对自己生活方便不方便，其次才考虑蜜源足不足的问题。“要高产，怕辛苦，这那行！”江小毛像是在责备自己似的提醒自己，一定要改变过去那种只利用平原，而且平原也只沿交通要道放牧蜜蜂的习惯。他决心要做到面向山区，深入平原，散放蜂群来提高采蜜量。江小毛就这样地深入各地，向当地群众了解作物播种情况；然后，把这些情况归纳起来安排全年蜜蜂转地放牧的计划。他在放牧蜜蜂时，还特别注意抓住季计划，准确地掌握作物开花和流蜜时间，做到一环扣一环，源源不断地做到蜂不离花。例如在新登万市芙源坞放蜂采集乌桕花时，江小毛等同志首先在这个山坞里进行了细致的观察，发现山上山下乌桕林很分散，花开也不一致。朝南、向阳的乌桕树，桕花已盛开；朝北、日照较差的乌桕树，桕花正含苞待放。他们决定“散放蜂群”，将原来一个场分成七个场。并且还从桕花流蜜较早的山谷口逐渐转移到流蜜较晚的谷底，延长了采蜜期，促使了蜂、蜜、蜡的增产。
    注：一框，即一张“巢础”，是六千个六角形相连在一起的蜂房基地。蜜蜂只要在这人工压制的“巢础”上分泌蜂蜡，把基础加高就成了蜂房，即“巢脾”。蜂王在巢脾上产卵，带有卵的脾叫子脾，子脾又分称为卵脾、幼虫脾和封盖蛹脾。
