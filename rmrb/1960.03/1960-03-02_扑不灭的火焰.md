American imperialism is stepping up its planning for a massive armed intervention in Cuba. In its reply to the Cuban government on February 29, the US government, while expressing its agreement to negotiate unresolved issues with Cuba, still insisted that the United States was "free to take any steps it deems necessary, fully consistent with its international obligations," to defend America's "legitimate rights and interests." This note once again exposed the United States' sinister plans to interfere in Cuba. Eisenhower's current visit to South America is also part of this massive conspiracy. An editorial in the Argentine magazine "Solucion" pointed out that Eisenhower's visit to South America "is to exchange economic aid for political support" to "extinguish the flame of Cuba." People all over the world must be seriously vigilant against the American hawk, with an olive branch in its beak, extending its poisonous claws towards Cuba.

For a year, the wave of the Cuban people's struggle to safeguard national independence and fight for democracy has been washing away the feudal system represented by the Batista dictatorship at home, and the colonial system of American monopoly groups. A new Cuba is growing stronger and stronger in the struggle.

The Cuban people have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against American interference, resolutely defending the fruits of the revolution. From the day the Cuban people overthrew the Batista dictatorship, American imperialism has continuously carried out brutal interference in Cuba in military, political, and economic aspects, vainly attempting to strangle the Cuban revolution in its infancy. However, the Cuban people, who had suffered bloody enslavement and exploitation by the United States and Batista, and who seized power through arduous guerrilla warfare, will never be subdued by any threat. In 1959, the Cuban people held three mass demonstrations with millions of participants, opposing US interference in the Cuban government's punishment of counter-revolutionary criminals, supporting land reform, and protesting against American armed provocations. In order to defend their hard-won gains, the Cuban people have taken up guns, organized a million-strong militia, and are strengthening military training and learning to master weapons, ready to meet the invaders at any time. The broad masses have also launched a nationwide aircraft donation movement. The sugar workers alone donated 250,000 pesos (each peso equals one US dollar) in the first batch to buy airplanes to counter American aircraft bombing. Cuban Prime Minister Castro has correctly reflected the heroic spirit of the Cuban people's common hatred of the enemy. He said: "The heroic Cuban people will never allow others to seize their hard-won gains. The Cuban people have finally become the masters of their own destiny, and no one can stop them now. Threats can only increase their strength. The people grow in the face of threats; the Cuban people's revolution has become even more firm." This is a stern warning to American interventionists.

The Cuban people are determined to change the backward situation caused by long-term colonial rule. In the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, they are steadfastly implementing land reform. By the end of 1959, the Land Reform Committee had taken over 575 large estates, covering an area of more than 65,000 caballeries (each caballeria equals 201.45 mu), shaking the old roots of American plunder of the Cuban people. The Cuban government has designated this year as the year of land reform, preparing to further implement the land reform movement. The Cuban people understand that in order to achieve economic independence and develop agricultural production, they must first destroy the large estate system on which domestic and foreign reactionaries rely to suck the blood and sweat of the Cuban people, and complete land reform. In order to recover and protect national resources, the Cuban government promulgated laws abolishing all concessions to American companies and restricting the exploitation of American capital, such as the petroleum law and the mining law, and began to take over land occupied by American steel, nickel, cobalt, and other enterprises. On the basis of land reform, the Cuban people are actively developing diversified economies, developing national industries, and developing foreign trade. The Cuban government has decided to allocate 300 million pesos this year to develop industrial and agricultural production, of which 152 million pesos will be invested in developing agricultural product processing enterprises, the chemical industry, the textile industry, the mining industry, and the metal processing industry. To support the country's industrialization, the Cuban people voluntarily donate 4% of their wages as an industrialization fund.

At present, the Cuban people are shouldering the dual tasks of resisting foreign interference and developing the national economy under very difficult conditions. However, in the past year, people's lives have still improved. Many workers and peasants have moved into new homes. Recently, another thousand new houses have been built. Batista's military barracks have been converted into schools, and this year it is planned to build 10,000 rural classrooms. There are "people's stores" in the countryside with the nature of consumer cooperatives. Due to the development of industry and agriculture and the implementation of public works, unemployment has gradually improved. Workers in sugarcane fields who used to work only three months a year now have work almost all year round. In 1959, the national income reached 2.5 billion pesos, an increase of 17% compared to 1958. All these realities of life make the Cuban people cherish the fruits of the revolution as they cherish their own eyes, and understand that they must use all their strength to defend them.

The victory of the Cuban people naturally has a huge impact on the countries of Latin America. Since a small country of six million people, Cuba, can do this at the doorstep of the United States, the people of other countries in Latin America have reason to believe that they can do it too. The revolutionary flame of the Cuban people has illuminated the path for the Latin American people to safeguard independence, fight for democracy, and strive for economic independence. Encouraged by the victory of the Cuban people's revolution, the national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin American countries has further developed in the past year, and the flames of safeguarding national independence and fighting for democracy have been ignited everywhere. The storm against American colonialism is sweeping the entire Latin American continent. It is precisely because of this situation that the American ruling clique hates the Cuban revolution to the bone and tries every possible means to strangle it. However, it is also because of this situation of common awakening among the people of Latin American countries that American imperialism has not dared to act rashly against Cuba. In the words of the American ruling clique themselves, they have had to adopt a policy of "restraint and patience." However, this so-called policy of "patience and restraint" is just that they have not yet launched an armed attack. American imperialism is unwilling to accept its failure in Cuba. In the past year, it has colluded with and used enemies inside and outside Cuba to carry out various kinds of interference activities against Cuba, using both economic and military threats, and engaging in subversion and sabotage conspiracies. Since the beginning of this year, American interference activities have become even more intensified. The US government openly demanded in a formal note that the Cuban government change its land reform policy, while threatening to reduce Cuba's sugar import quota. Aircraft taking off from the United States, even piloted by Americans, have continuously harassed and bombed Cuban cities and towns. The US naval and air forces are conducting frequent "exercises" in the Caribbean Sea near Cuban territory. The United States is stepping up the organization and training of mercenaries and Cuban rebels in countries such as Honduras and the Dominican Republic, and is increasing its troops at its military bases in Cuba... All these facts show that the American ruling clique is actively preparing to openly intervene in Cuba with armed force.

The American ruling clique believes that before carrying out armed intervention in Cuba, it must find ways to alienate Cuba from other Latin American countries and isolate Cuba. Therefore, American government officials and propaganda machines are doing their best to distort the actual situation in Cuba. At a press conference on January 26, Eisenhower described the anti-American sentiment of the Cuban people caused by American interference as a "conspiracy of international communism." "U.S. News & World Report" even alarmingly clamored: "A communist country is rapidly forming" in Cuba. Everyone knows that this kind of propaganda with ulterior motives is the consistent method used by the United States to create excuses for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and suppressing national independence movements. What is happening in Cuba is a national democratic revolution. The struggles carried out by the Cuban people for more than a year after overthrowing the traitorous Batista dictatorship, including the implementation of land reform, confiscation of the land of large estate owners, recovery of national resources occupied and plundered by foreign monopoly capital, and efforts to develop agricultural production and national industries, are the most basic rights of any nation that does not want to be enslaved. The reason why the United States is doing its best to spread rumors about the existence of a "communist conspiracy" or a "communist threat" in Cuba is simply to use this to intimidate other Latin American countries, so that it can repeat the criminal activities of subverting the democratic government of Guatemala. This is also one of the main purposes of Eisenhower's so-called "goodwill visit" to South America this time. This American plot is so obvious that even the "New York Times" believes that there is no need to hide it. In a report on February 18, the newspaper pointed out that the current goal of the United States is to "isolate" Cuba "in this hemisphere." American reporter Joseph Newman also revealed in an article that the primary problem for the United States in Latin America is to "win political support" to prevent the influence of the Cuban revolution from "expanding to other regions of this hemisphere." Because if the influence of the Cuban revolution continues to expand, "that will undermine the entire Pan-American system." He said that this is the issue that Eisenhower hopes to discuss during his visit. Eisenhower is attempting to seek "multilateral collective action" during his visit to impose sanctions on Cuba. Cuba's "Hoy" exposed that Eisenhower's visit to Latin America was aimed at isolating the Cuban Castro government and creating favorable conditions for the US plan of aggression against Cuba. The Central Committee of the Chilean Socialist Party issued a statement exposing Eisenhower's visit as seeking political support in order to launch an attack on Castro's revolutionary government. The Argentine Committee in Support of the Cuban Revolution also condemned Eisenhower's visit as an attempt to establish a "sanitary cordon" to resist Cuba. But as Cuba's "Hoy" pointed out, American imperialism is bound to be greatly disappointed. The imperialists cannot encircle Cuba with hunger, nor can they subdue Cuba with military force. The revolutionary flame of Cuba cannot be extinguished.

Today, the struggles of the people of Latin American countries to win and safeguard national independence and oppose American colonial rule have gradually converged into an irresistible torrent. They are increasingly strengthening their unity in the common struggle. The people of many countries have openly stated that they regard the Cuban people's struggle against American interference as their own struggle and give it their full support. Brazilian students warned Eisenhower: "The basic principles of the Cuban revolution are the principles followed by the people of all countries living in Latin America." "Any interference in Cuba will be regarded as aggression against the entire Latin America." When Eisenhower visited South American countries, the masses in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile held demonstrations, shouting down with American imperialism and opposing American interference in Cuba. The broad masses of the Latin American people who have suffered the disasters of American imperialist plunder and enslavement cannot be deceived. The American attempt to isolate Cuba is doomed to failure. What will become increasingly isolated in Latin America will certainly not be the Cuban people, but the American imperialists.

    扑不灭的火焰
    美帝国主义正在加紧策划武装干涉古巴的巨大阴谋。美国政府2月29日复照古巴政府，一面表示同意同古巴谈判悬而未决的问题，但是仍然叫嚷美国“可以自由采取它认为有必要采取的同它承担的国际义务完全一致的任何步骤”，以保卫美国的“合法权利和利益”。这一照会再一次暴露了美国对古巴进行干涉的罪恶打算。艾森豪威尔正在南美进行的访问，也是这个巨大阴谋中的一部分。阿根廷“解决”周刊发表的社论就指出，艾森豪威尔访问南美，“是为了以经济援助换取政治上的支持”，来“扑灭古巴的火焰”。全世界人民对于口衔橄榄枝的美国凶鹰伸向古巴的毒爪，不能不保持严重的警惕。
    一年以来，古巴人民为维护民族独立、争取民主而斗争的浪潮，冲刷着国内以巴蒂斯塔独裁者为代表的封建制度，冲刷着美国垄断集团的殖民制度，一个新生的古巴在斗争中日益成长壮大起来。
    古巴人民进行了英勇顽强的反对美国干涉的斗争，坚决保卫着革命的胜利果实。从古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的那一天起，美帝国主义就对古巴不断进行军事、政治、经济各方面的粗暴干涉，妄想把古巴的革命扼杀在新生的日子里。但是，曾经饱受美国和巴蒂斯塔血腥奴役和压榨的古巴人民，经过艰苦的游击战斗才夺取了政权的古巴人民，决不是任何威胁所能压服的。古巴人民在1959年一年中举行过三次成百万人参加的大示威，反对美国干涉古巴政府惩治反革命罪犯，支持土地改革，抗议美国武装挑衅。古巴人民为了保卫自己的胜利果实，拿起了枪杆，组织百万民兵，正在加强军事训练和学习掌握武器，随时准备迎击侵略者。广大的群众还展开了全民性的捐献飞机运动，单是糖业工人第一批就捐献了二十五万比索（每一比索等于一美元）购买飞机，来对付美国飞机的轰炸。古巴总理卡斯特罗曾经正确地反映了古巴人民这种敌忾同仇的英勇气概，他说：“英勇的古巴人民决不允许别人夺取他们的胜利果实。古巴人民终于做了自己命运的主人，已经没有任何人阻挡得住他们了，威胁只能增加他们的力量。人民在威胁面前成长着；古巴人民的革命更加坚定了。”这是对美国干涉者的一个严正的警告。
    古巴人民决心要改变长期受殖民主义统治所造成的落后状况。他们在同国内外敌人的斗争中，坚定地实行着土地改革。到1959年底，土地改革委员会已接管了五百七十五个大庄园，面积达六万五千多卡瓦耶里亚（每一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五亩），触动了美国掠夺古巴人民的老根。古巴政府已把今年规定为土地改革年，准备进一步贯彻土地改革的运动。古巴人民懂得，要争取经济独立，发展农业生产，首先必须摧毁国内外反动派赖以吮吸古巴人民血汗的大庄园制度，完成土地改革。为了收回和保护国家的资源，古巴政府颁布了废除美国公司的一切租让权和限制美国资本盘剥的石油法和矿业法，开始接管了美国钢铁、镍矿、钴矿等企业所霸占的土地。古巴人民在土地改革的基础上，积极发展多种经济，发展民族工业，发展对外贸易。古巴政府决定在今年拨款三亿比索，发展工农业生产。其中一亿五千二百万比索投资发展农产品加工企业、化学工业、纺织工业、采矿工业和金属加工工业。古巴人民为支持国家的工业化，自发地捐出4％的工资作为工业化基金。
    目前，古巴人民担负着反抗外国干涉和在十分困难条件下发展民族经济的双重任务，然而在过去一年中，人民的生活还是有所改善。许多工人农民搬进了新居。最近又建成了一千所新房屋。巴蒂斯塔的军营都改建成为学校，今年计划还要建筑一万所乡村教室。农村中有了消费合作社性质的“人民商店”。由于工农业的发展和举办公共工程，失业现象逐步获得改善，过去一年只有三个月工作的甘蔗园的工人现在差不多都一年到头有工可做了。1959年的国民收入达到二十五亿比索，比1958年已增加了17％。这一切生活的现实，使得古巴的人民像珍爱自己的眼珠一样地珍爱革命的胜利果实，并且懂得必须用全部力量来保卫它们。
    古巴人民的胜利自然不能不在拉丁美洲各国中发生巨大的影响。既然在美国大门口一个六百万人口的小国古巴能够这样做，拉丁美洲别的国家的人民就有理由认为自己也能这样做。古巴人民的革命火焰照亮了拉丁美洲人民维护独立、争取民主、争取经济独立的道路。在古巴人民革命胜利的鼓舞下，一年来拉丁美洲各国的民族民主革命运动有了进一步的发展，到处燃起了维护民族独立和争取民主的火焰，反对美国殖民主义的风暴席卷整个拉丁美洲大陆。正是由于这样的形势，美国统治集团对古巴的革命恨之入骨，千方百计地妄想加以扼杀。然而也正是因为拉丁美洲各国人民共同觉醒的这种形势，使得美帝国主义一直还不敢对古巴轻举妄动。用美国统治集团自己的话来说，他们不得不采取“克制和忍耐”的政策。但是，这种所谓“忍耐和克制”的政策也不过仅仅是还没有发动武装进攻而已。美帝国主义不甘心在古巴的失败，在过去一年中，勾结和利用古巴国内外的敌人，对古巴进行了各种各样的干涉活动，经济和军事威胁齐施，颠复和破坏阴谋并进。今年以来，美国的干涉活动更是变本加厉。美国政府公然以正式照会要求古巴政府改变它的土地改革政策，同时扬言要削减古巴食糖的进口份额。从美国起飞的甚至由美国人驾驶的飞机不断袭扰和轰炸古巴的城乡。美国的海空军在加勒比海地区古巴领土附近进行频繁的“演习”。美国加紧在洪都拉斯、多米尼加等国组织和训练雇佣兵和古巴的叛乱分子，向它在古巴的军事基地增兵……这一些事实都说明，美国统治集团正在积极准备对古巴进行公开的武装干涉。
    美国统治集团认为，在对古巴进行武装干涉之前，必须设法离间古巴同其他拉丁美洲国家的关系，把古巴孤立起来。因此，美国的政府官员和宣传机器竭力对古巴的实际情况加以歪曲。艾森豪威尔在1月26日的记者招待会上，把由于美国干涉而引起的古巴人民的反美情绪说成是什么“国际共产主义的阴谋”。“美国新闻与世界报道”更是危言耸听地叫嚷：在古巴“一个共产主义国家正在迅速形成”。谁都知道，这种别有用心的宣传是美国为干涉别国内政和镇压民族独立运动制造借口的一贯手法。在古巴所发生的是一次民族民主革命。古巴人民在推翻了卖国的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权之后，一年多来所进行的斗争，包括实行土地改革，没收大庄园主的土地，收回被外国垄断资本占据和掠夺的国家资源，致力发展农业生产和民族工业等等，都是任何一个不愿做奴隶的民族最起码的权利。美国之所以竭力散布在古巴存在什么“共产主义阴谋”或“共产主义威胁”云云，不过是为了要借此恐吓拉丁美洲其他国家，便于它重演颠覆危地马拉民主政府的罪恶活动，这也是艾森豪威尔此次前往南美进行所谓“亲善访问”的主要目的之一。美国的这种图谋是如此的明显，以致“纽约时报”也认为没有必要隐讳。这家报纸在2月18日的一篇报道中指出，美国当前的目标就是“在这个半球孤立”古巴。美国记者约瑟夫·纽曼在一篇文章中也透露，美国在拉丁美洲的首要问题是“争取政治支持”来防止古巴革命的影响“扩大到本半球的其他地区”。因为如果古巴革命的影响继续扩大下去，“那就会破坏整个泛美体系”。他说，这就是艾森豪威尔在他访问中希望讨论的问题。艾森豪威尔企图在访问中寻求“多边的集体行动”，来对古巴实行制裁。古巴“今日报”就揭穿，艾森豪威尔访问拉丁美洲的目的是要孤立古巴卡斯特罗政府，并为美国反对古巴的侵略计划制造有利条件。智利社会党中央委员会发表声明，揭露艾森豪威尔的访问是寻求政治支持，以便对卡斯特罗的革命政府发动进攻。阿根廷声援古巴革命委员会也谴责艾森豪威尔这次访问是要建立一条抵制古巴的“防疫线”。但是正如古巴“今日报”所指出的，美帝国主义一定要大失所望，帝国主义者无法用饥饿来包围古巴，他们也不能用军事力量来使古巴屈服。古巴的革命火焰是扑灭不了的。
    今天拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立、反对美国殖民统治的斗争已经逐渐汇合成为不可抗拒的巨流，他们正在共同的斗争中日益加强团结，许多国家的人民已经公开表示把古巴人民反对美国干涉的斗争看作是自己的斗争，而给以全力的支援。巴西学生警告艾森豪威尔说：“古巴革命的基本原则，就是生活在拉丁美洲的各国人民所共同遵循的原则”。“对古巴的任何干涉，将被认为是对整个拉丁美洲的侵略”。当艾森豪威尔到南美各国访问的时候，巴西、阿根廷、乌拉圭、智利各国的群众都举行了示威，高呼打倒美帝国主义，反对美国干涉古巴。身受美帝国主义掠夺和奴役灾害的拉丁美洲广大人民，是欺骗不了的。美国企图孤立古巴的阴谋是决难得逞。在拉丁美洲中日益孤立的肯定将不是古巴人民而是美帝国主义者。
