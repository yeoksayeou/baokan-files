   “March 8th” International Working Women's Day

    March 8th this year marks the 50th anniversary of “March 8th” International Working Women’s Day. This revolutionary festival with a long history originated in 1909. On March 8th of that year, female workers in the American textile and garment industries, especially in Chicago, held large-scale demonstrations to demand increased wages, an eight-hour workday, and the right to vote. Their firm and forceful actions were warmly supported by working women in the United States and around the world. In August of the following year, when the Second International Socialist Women’s Conference was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, Clara Zetkin, a prominent female activist in the German and international workers' movement and secretary of the International Women’s Secretariat, proposed at the conference that March 8th be designated as "World Women's Day of Struggle" each year. This was intended to unite and consolidate the great strength of working women from all countries against imperialist and colonial wars and to defend peace. This proposal was immediately and unanimously endorsed by delegates from various countries attending the conference. The conference also put forward proposals such as implementing the "eight-hour work system," "equal pay for equal work," "protection of motherhood," and "protection of child labor."

    When the first "March 8th" was commemorated in 1911, working women in Germany, Austria, the United States, Switzerland, Denmark, and other countries held demonstrations. Among them, Austria had the largest scale, with 80,000 female workers participating in the demonstration in the capital, Vienna. Thus, the activities commemorating “March 8th” gradually expanded to the whole world.

    On March 8, 1917, female workers in Petrograd, Russia, under the leadership of the Russian Communist Party, held demonstrations against hunger, the imperialist war, and the Tsarist system. This struggle played an important role in leading to the outbreak of the February Revolution on March 12th (February 27th in the Russian calendar) of that year. Subsequently, they actively participated in the February Revolution together with male workers, closely integrating the women's liberation movement with the class struggle of the proletariat, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of working women worldwide.

    The activities of Chinese women commemorating “March 8th” International Working Women's Day were initially carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, each commemoration was closely linked to the tasks of the Chinese revolution. When the first “March 8th” was commemorated in 1924, it was at the height of the First Revolutionary Civil War. The Party led hundreds of revolutionary women in Guangzhou to hold a commemorative meeting in the Xigua Garden in Guangzhou. At the meeting, resounding slogans such as "Down with feudalism, down with imperialism, strive for women's liberation" were put forward. The conference also put forward demands such as "Protect child laborers and pregnant women, eliminate child brides and polygamy, prohibit the keeping of maids and concubines, abolish the prostitution system, and establish children's protection laws." In 1926, the revolutionary storm swept across the country. The women's movement also developed vigorously. On March 8th of this year, many large cities across the country held mass commemorative meetings and demonstrations. Among them, Guangzhou, where the revolutionary government was located, was the most enthusiastic, with more than 10,000 women participating in the commemorative meeting. They put forward slogans such as "Participate in the National Revolution, participate in the National Assembly Movement, overthrow the warlords, and overthrow imperialism!" "Protect female workers," and so on.

    During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, on March 8, 1932, it was when the Party was leading the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to continuously smash Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction's three encirclements, and the revolutionary mass movement continued to rise. On this day, tens of thousands of women gathered in Ruijin, Jiangxi, the seat of the provisional central government of the revolutionary base area, to hold a huge commemorative meeting. Chairman Mao personally attended the meeting and gave a speech, which greatly inspired the women. The conference put forward action slogans such as "Smash the encirclement, consolidate and expand the Soviet area; strengthen the women's self-defense forces and women's organizations; expand the Red Army."

    During the period of resisting the Japanese imperialist invasion of China, women across the country actively responded to the slogan put forward by the Party: "Stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan." On March 8, 1936, female workers in Shanghai united with more than 2,000 oppressed women from all walks of life to hold a commemorative meeting, proposing slogans such as "Women from all walks of life unite!" "Immediately declare war on Japan!" After the meeting, a large-scale demonstration was held. During this period, women in the anti-Japanese base areas held women's congresses every year on March 8th, mobilizing women in various base areas to actively participate in production and support the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1938, the “March 8th” congress held by women in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region also formally established the Women’s Federation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, better uniting women throughout the border region to fight for national liberation.

    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries perfidiously launched large-scale offensives against the liberated areas. The women in the liberated areas participated in production and in the militia, sending their husbands and sons to join the army, making lofty contributions to supporting the Liberation War. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, women also extensively launched struggles against the civil war, against hunger, and against persecution. Every year, "March 8th" became an important day for them to mobilize and organize forces to support the Liberation War and oppose Kuomintang persecution.

    After the national liberation, the status of women has been unprecedentedly improved. The Constitution stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. With the victory of the socialist revolution and the development of socialist construction, the role played by the vast number of women is becoming increasingly greater. This has enabled Chinese women to forever end the tragic history of being oppressed and enslaved for thousands of years and become masters of the new China. In 1958, under the inspiration and promotion of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the women's movement leaped to a new stage of complete liberation. Large numbers of women in urban and rural areas across the country participated in industrial and agricultural production and other social labor. Hundreds of millions of activists in socialist construction emerged continuously in various places. Since then, women across the country have greeted their festival every year with outstanding achievements, and further prepared their forces to make greater contributions to accelerating the socialist construction of the motherland and defending world peace. This year, Chinese women have selected 10,000 "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetters" and "March 8th Red Banner Collectives" as their pacesetters, and are carrying out an increase production and economize movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in various positions, using more outstanding achievements to welcome the first "March 8th" International Working Women's Day of the 1960s.

   “三八”国际劳动妇女节
    今年3月8日，是“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年纪念日。这个有悠久历史的革命节日，起源于1909年。当年3月8日，美国纺织工业和服装业，特别是芝加哥的女工们，为要求增加工资、实行八小时工作日和获得选举权，举行了大规模的示威游行。她们坚决有力的行动，得到了美国和全世界广大劳动妇女的热烈响应。次年8月，当第二届国际社会主义妇女大会在丹麦哥本哈根举行的时候，德国和国际工人运动杰出的女活动家、国际妇女书记处书记克拉拉·蔡特金在会上倡议，以每年3月8日为“世界妇女的斗争日”，以此来团结和巩固各国广大劳动妇女反对帝国主义战争和殖民战争、保卫和平的伟大力量。这个建议立即得到与会各国代表的热烈拥护并一致通过。大会还提出了实行“八小时工作制”、“同工同酬”、“保护母性”、“保护童工”等提案。
    1911年纪念第一个“三八”节的时候，德、奥、美、瑞士、丹麦等国的劳动妇女都举行了示威游行。其中以奥国的规模最大，有八万女工在首都维也纳参加了示威游行。这样，纪念“三八”节的活动就逐渐扩大到全世界。
    1917年3月8日，俄国彼得格勒的女工们，在俄国共产党的领导下，举行了反对饥饿、反对帝国主义战争、反对沙皇制度的示威游行。这次斗争对于导致当年3月12日（俄历2月27日）二月革命的爆发起了重要的作用。接着，她们还和男工们一起积极参加了二月革命，把妇女解放运动和无产阶级的阶级斗争紧密地结合在一起，为全世界劳动妇女的斗争树立了光辉榜样。
    中国妇女纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节的活动，一开始就是在中国共产党领导下进行的，所以，历次的纪念活动都是同中国革命的任务密切结合在一起。1924年第一次纪念“三八”节的时候，正当第一次国内革命战争进入高潮，党领导了广州市革命妇女群众数百人，在广州西瓜园内举行了纪念大会。会上提出打倒封建主义，打倒帝国主义，争取妇女解放等响亮的口号。大会还提出了“保护童工孕妇，革除童养媳、多妻制，禁止蓄婢纳妾，废除娼妓制度，建立儿童保护法”等要求。1926年，是大革命风暴席卷全国的一年。妇女运动也随着蓬勃发展。这一年3月8日，全国许多大城市都举行了群众性的纪念大会和示威游行，其中以革命政府所在地的广州最为热烈，有一万多妇女群众参加了纪念大会。她们提出了“参加国民革命运动，参加国民会议运动，打倒军阀，打倒帝国主义！”“保护女工”等口号。
    第二次国内革命战争时期的1932年3月8日，正是党领导工农红军连续粉碎蒋介石反动派三次围攻，革命的群众运动继续高涨的时候。这一天，有几万名妇女群众在革命根据地临时中央政府所在地——江西瑞金，举行了规模巨大的纪念大会，毛主席亲自出席了大会，并作了讲演，对妇女群众起了极大的鼓舞作用。大会提出了“粉碎围攻，巩固、扩大苏区；健全妇女赤卫队和妇女组织；扩大红军”等行动口号。
    在反对日本帝国主义侵略中国的时期，全国妇女都积极响应了党提出的“停止内战，一致抗日”的口号。1636年3月8日，上海女工们团结了各界被压迫妇女共二千多人举行了纪念大会，提出“妇女界团结起来！”“立即对日宣战！”等口号，会后并举行规模巨大的示威游行。抗日根据地的妇女群众在这个时期内，每年3月8日都举行妇女大会，动员各根据地妇女积极参加生产，支援抗日战争。1938年陕甘宁边区妇女举行的“三八”节大会上还正式成立了陕甘宁边区妇女联合会，更好地团结全边区妇女为民族解放而斗争。
    抗日战争胜利后国民党反动派背信弃义地向解放区发动大规模进攻。解放区的妇女们一面参加生产，一面参加民兵，送郎送子参军，为支援解放战争作出了崇高的贡献；在国民党统治区，妇女们也广泛地展开了反内战、反饥饿、反迫害的斗争。每年“三八”节就成为她们动员组织力量支援解放战争和反对国民党迫害的重要日子。
    全国解放以后，妇女的地位空前提高。宪法规定了妇女在政治、经济、文化、社会和家庭生活各方面享有和男子平等的权利。随着社会主义革命的胜利，社会主义建设事业的发展，广大妇女所起的作用愈来愈大。这样就使我国的妇女永远结束了几千年来被压迫被奴役的惨痛历史，成为新中国的主人。1958年，在党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的鼓舞和推动下，妇女运动又跃进到了一个彻底解放的新阶段。全国城市和农村妇女大批地参加了工农业生产和其他社会劳动。各地不断涌现出数以千万计的社会主义建设积极分子。从此，全国妇女每年都以出色的成就来迎接自己的节日，并进一步准备力量为加速祖国社会主义建设和保卫世界和平，作出更大的贡献。今年，中国妇女又选出了一万个“三八红旗手”和“三八红旗集体”作为自己的标兵，在各个岗位上开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，用更卓越的成就来迎接六十年代的第一个“三八”国际劳动妇女节。
