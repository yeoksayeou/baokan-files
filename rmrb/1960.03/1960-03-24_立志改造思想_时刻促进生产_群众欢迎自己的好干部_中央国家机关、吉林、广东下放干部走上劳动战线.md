Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The vast majority of cadres transferred from central government agencies this year have arrived in their designated areas and are working alongside commune members in a vigorous spring plowing and production campaign.

This year, the agencies have transferred a total of 8,938 cadres for labor training. With the exception of a few who are still preparing to depart, the rest arrived in their destinations successively in February and March. Over 7,900 cadres have been transferred to people's communes in 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, while the remaining cadres have been transferred to enterprises and factories within their respective systems. All transferred cadres from central agencies will undergo labor training at the grassroots level for a period of about one year.

After arriving at the grassroots level, the transferred cadres from central agencies were warmly received by local leading cadres and the masses. After the transferred cadres from the Ministry of Public Security arrived in Xining, the provincial responsible cadres specifically met with them and introduced the local work situation. After the transferred cadres from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry arrived in Yuci area, Shanxi Province, the Organization Minister of the Yuci Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China helped them become familiar with the local situation and understand their needs in terms of labor and life. The commune members of the local communes warmly cared for them, some even vacated their houses to accommodate the transferred cadres and tried their best to help them adapt to the new environment in life and labor. In the Shuangcike People's Commune in Gansu Province, the transferred cadres established close ties with the masses from the very beginning. The masses cared for them as if they were their own children, with some elderly women getting up in the middle of the night to cover the transferred cadres with quilts and asking them if they were cold, which deeply moved the transferred cadres.

Now, the transferred cadres are full of energy and have joined the masses in the spring plowing and production upsurge. Some have participated in the drought resistance and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, while others have participated in water conservancy construction. The 45 cadres transferred from the commercial departments to the Louzhuangzi Management District of the Chengguan Commune in Ji County, Hebei Province, participated in labor with the masses on the very first day of their arrival at the commune. They completed an urgent production task that required seven days in just three days, and this management district was therefore rated as the first place in the entire commune. After the transferred cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry went down to the grassroots, they actively participated in labor and immediately threw themselves into the ranks of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution. The transferred cadres from the Ministry of Health and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission also gave full play to their expertise, carrying out health and sports publicity activities while participating in labor. Some cadres from the Sports Commission also assisted in training militia. According to statistics, among the transferred cadres from central government agencies this year, more than 56% are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and there are 628 leading cadres at the section chief and division chief level or above. Thanks to the exemplary role of a large number of backbone forces, the transferred cadres are full of energy, actively learning from the masses and cadres, and actively participating in labor training, becoming a force to promote the sustained leap forward in their respective regions.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 23rd: More than 11,500 cadres from Party and government agencies and mass organizations at the county level and above in Jilin Province who have been transferred for labor training this year have successively taken up their labor posts.

This year, the number of cadres transferred from Jilin Province accounts for 20% of the total number of cadres in the province who should be transferred for labor training. Among them, 10% are leading cadres at the section chief level or above, and the rest are young intellectuals who joined the work after liberation and have not experienced grassroots work training. Among the 2,100 cadres transferred from provincial-level agencies and some units in Changchun and Baicheng regions, 182 are leading cadres, and the rest are all young intellectual cadres. Among them, there are 590 Party members and 615 League members, accounting for 57% of the total number of transferred cadres.

This year, the work of transferring cadres in the province was done early and well. At the beginning of January, various regions and units summarized the experience of transferring cadres last year while studying and arranging the cadre transfer work for this year. At the Changchun Regional Organization Work Conference held in mid-January, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China studied and determined that 3,533 cadres would be transferred in the region this year, an increase of more than 1,000 from last year. Among the cadres transferred for labor training this year, 80% went to rural people's communes, most of whom were transferred to the weak management areas and production teams of the people's communes. In the Siping area, cadres transferred to weak production teams of the people's communes accounted for 60% of the transferred cadres.

Before the transferred cadres took up their labor posts, various regions and units held farewell meetings, at which the responsible comrades of the Party and government put forward their hopes and requirements to them. The Tongyu County Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward ten requirements to the transferred cadres, including "overcoming difficulties and actively doing a good job in labor" and "doing a good job in ideological transformation through labor training." Because the vast number of transferred cadres have a clearer understanding of the purpose of transferring for labor training and are fully prepared ideologically, they have expressed their determination to the Party to work hard to transform themselves in accordance with the Party's instructions.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 23rd: The first batch of 3,000 cadres transferred from Guangdong provincial-level agencies this year have successively arrived at people's communes in seven counties, including Dianbai, Qingyuan, and Conghua, to participate in labor training. Among these cadres, 2,000 will undergo longer-term training for six months to one year, and 1,000 will participate in about one month of physical labor. Among them, there are 450 leading cadres at the section chief level or above.

Guangdong provincial-level agencies have adopted various methods to organize cadres to participate in labor training. This year, leading cadres at the section chief level or above will be divided into six batches, with each batch accounting for one-sixth of the total number, and will be transferred in rotation to serve as commune members or workers for one month. Other cadres will continue to be transferred in batches to participate in longer-term labor training for six months to one year, and the number of transferred people will reach about one-tenth of the total number of cadres suitable for participating in physical labor.

Guangdong provincial-level agencies attach great importance to the work of organizing cadre transfers. After the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on February 14, leading cadres of various units actively arranged work to transfer cadres, and many cadres enthusiastically responded to the call of the Provincial Committee and applied for transfer.

This year, the cadres transferred from Guangdong provincial-level agencies are mainly going to people's communes, especially to areas with relatively weak work foundations and more difficult conditions for training.

    立志改造思想　时刻促进生产
    群众欢迎自己的好干部
    中央国家机关、吉林、广东下放干部走上劳动战线
    新华社23日讯?中央国家机关今年下放的干部，绝大多数已经到达下放地区，同公社社员一起展开了轰轰烈烈的春耕生产热潮。
    各机关今年共抽出八千九百三十八名干部下放劳动锻炼，除了还有少数人正准备出发以外，其余都已在2、3月份先后到达目的地。有七千九百多名干部下放到二十六个省、市、自治区的人民公社，其余的干部下放到本系统的企业和厂矿。各机关所有的下放干部都将在基层进行为期一年左右的劳动锻炼。
    中央机关的下放干部到达基层以后，受到当地领导干部和群众的热情接待。公安部的下放干部到了西宁以后，省里的负责干部专门接见了他们，介绍了当地的工作情况。冶金工业部的下放干部到达山西省榆次地区以后，中共榆次市委组织部长帮助他们熟悉当地情况，了解他们劳动和生活方面的需要；当地公社的社员们更是热情地关怀他们，有的专门腾出了住房接待下放干部，并且尽量帮助他们在生活上和劳动上适应新的环境。在甘肃省双茨科人民公社，下放干部一开始就同群众建立了密切的联系，群众像对待亲生儿女一样地关怀他们，有的老大娘半夜起来给下放干部盖好被子，问寒问暖，使下放干部深受感动。
    现在，下放干部都干劲十足，同群众一起投入了春耕生产热潮，有的参加了抗旱和积肥运动，有的参加兴修水利。商业部门下放到河北省蓟县城关公社娄庄子管理区的四十五名干部，到达公社的第一天就和群众一起参加了劳动。公社分配的一个需要七天完成的紧急生产任务，他们三天就完成了，这个管理区因此被评为全公社的第一名。第一机械工业部和冶金工业部的下放干部下去后，一面积极参加劳动，一面立即投入了大闹技术革命的行列。卫生部和体育运动委员会的下放干部，也都发挥了专长，在参加劳动的同时，开展卫生和体育宣传活动，有些体委的干部还协助训练民兵。据统计，今年中央国家机关的下放干部中，共产党员和共青团员占56％以上，科长和处长以上的领导干部有六百二十八人。由于有了大批的骨干力量发挥带头作用，下放干部都干劲十足，积极向群众和干部学习，积极参加劳动锻炼，成为促进所在地区持续跃进的一支力量。
    新华社长春23日电　吉林省县以上各级党政机关和群众团体今年下放劳动锻炼的一万一千五百多名干部，已经陆续走上劳动岗位。
    今年吉林省下放的干部，占全省应该下放劳动锻炼的干部总数的20％。其中10％是科长以上领导干部，其他都是解放后参加工作、没有经过基层工作锻炼的青年知识分子。省直属机关和长春、白城地区部分单位下放的二千一百名干部中，领导干部有一百八十二名，其他全是青年知识分子干部。其中有党员五百九十名，团员六百一十五名，党团员占下放干部总数的57％。
    今年全省下放干部工作做得又早又好。各个地区和单位早在1月初总结去年下放干部经验的同时，就研究和布置了今年的干部下放工作。中共长春市委在1月中旬召开的长春地区组织工作会议上，研究并确定今年全区下放三千五百三十三名干部，比去年增加一千多名。在今年下放劳动锻炼的干部中，80％是到农村人民公社，其中大部分是下放到人民公社的薄弱管理区和生产队。四平地区下放到人民公社薄弱生产队的干部占下放干部的60％。
    下放干部走上劳动岗位前，各地区、单位都召开了欢送大会，由党政负责同志向他们提出了希望和要求。中共通榆县委向下放干部提出了做到“克服困难积极劳动好”、
  “劳动锻炼思想改造好”等十好要求。由于广大下放干部对下放劳动锻炼的目的更加明确，思想准备充分，因此他们纷纷向党表示决心，一定按照党的指示努力锻炼改造自己。
    新华社广州23日电　广东省级机关今年第一批下放的三千名干部，已经陆续到达电白、清远、从化等七个县的人民公社参加劳动锻炼。这批干部中有两千人是进行为期半年到一年较长时间的锻炼，有一千人是参加一个月左右的体力劳动。其中有四百五十名科长级以上领导干部。
    广东省级机关今年组织干部下放参加劳动锻炼，采取了各种方式。今年内科长级以上领导干部将分成六批，每批占总人数六分之一，轮流下放当一个月的社员或工人。其他干部将继续分批下放参加半年到一年较长期的劳动锻炼，下放人数将达到适合参加体力劳动的干部总数十分之一左右。
    广东省级机关对组织干部下放的工作都很重视。中共广东省委于2月14日发出指示后，各单位领导干部都积极安排工作抽调干部下放，许多干部也热烈响应省委的号召，纷纷申请下放。
    今年，广东省级机关下放干部主要是到人民公社，特别是到工作基础比较薄弱和比较艰苦的地区进行锻炼。
