Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 25th: According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," U Nu told the newspaper's reporter on the 24th that after assuming the post of Prime Minister of Burma, he would adopt a "policy of active coexistence" and continue to maintain friendly relations with all countries.

U Nu said that Burma had signed the Sino-Burmese Border Issue Agreement and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression with China. Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev recently visited Burma and issued a joint communique. These prove that it is possible to maintain friendly relations with socialist countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
