How to Quickly Cultivate Sweet Potato Seedlings?

In order to plant sweet potatoes early, plant them well, and obtain high yields, the first thing is to have enough seedlings. Here we introduce a "high-temperature rapid seedling cultivation method" that produces seedlings quickly, produces a lot of seedlings, and produces strong seedlings, for your reference:

The high-temperature rapid seedling cultivation method is an improvement based on the return-flow fire kang (called a rolling shutter fire kang in the north). The specific method is to increase the original kang soil from two to three inches thick to three to four inches thick; the soil covering the sweet potato seeds is increased from the original one inch thick to about two inches thick, first covering a layer of sand, then a layer of soil, and then a layer of sand on top. Within twelve days of the seed potatoes being placed on the kang, the temperature should be maintained at around 40 degrees Celsius, and the kang soil moisture should be maintained at 18% to 20%. The seed potatoes placed on the kang should be strictly selected, and generally, disease-free tubers weighing two to three taels should be selected, and strict seed soaking and disinfection should be carried out.

This rapid seedling cultivation method has proven that this method produces seedlings four or five days earlier than the old method, and also produces more and stronger seedlings. The old method of seedling cultivation produced more than 8,000 seedlings from 100 jin of seed potatoes in the first five batches; however, rapid seedling cultivation produced more than 25,000 seedlings in the first three batches.

    怎样快速培育甘薯种秧？
    为了使甘薯种得早、种得好，又获得高产，首先得有足够的薯苗。这里我们介绍一种产苗快、产苗多、苗又壮的“高温快速育苗法”，供各地参考：
    高温快速育苗法是在回龙式火炕（北方称为倒卷帘火炕）的基础上改进的。具体办法是，把原来炕土由二至三寸厚增加到三至四寸厚；甘薯种复土由原来一寸多厚增到二寸厚左右，先复一层砂，再复一层土，上面又复一层砂。种薯上炕十二天内温度保持四十度左右，炕土湿度保持18％到20％。上炕的薯种应严格选择，一般应选择二三两重没病的薯块，并严格浸种消毒。
    这种快速育苗法证明这种办法较旧法育苗提前四、五天出苗，而且产苗多、苗壮。旧法育苗一百斤薯种前五茬苗产八千多棵；可是快速育苗头三茬就产二万五千多棵。
