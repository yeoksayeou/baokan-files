Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Colonel Kyaw Zaw Min, Military Attaché of the Union of Burma to China, and his wife held a reception this evening to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Armed Forces of the Union of Burma.

General Tan Zheng, Vice Minister of National Defense of our country, was invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, Colonel Kyaw Zaw Min delivered a speech. He mentioned that before Burma gained independence, the Burmese armed forces, together with the people, resisted fascism; after Burma's independence, protecting the Union of Burma and its constitution became the main task of the Burmese armed forces. He said that the Burmese armed forces are also committed, as much as possible, to rebuilding the country that was destroyed by the war, as well as other nation-building work.

Colonel Kyaw Zaw Min said: "The friendship and understanding that exist between the Burmese Armed Forces and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are self-evident. This friendship and understanding has always been the foundation of the friendly relations between the armed forces and the people of the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China. Here I would like to mention that the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Boundary Agreement recently signed between our two countries will further consolidate and strengthen the traditional friendly ties, amity, and mutual understanding between our two countries."

General Tan Zheng, Vice Minister of National Defense of our country, extended warm congratulations to the armed forces of the friendly neighbor, the Union of Burma, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army at the reception. He said: "Now our two countries are engaged in the great cause of peaceful construction, and we need a peaceful environment. Therefore, defending world peace and defending the independence of our respective countries have become our common goals, and this is also the common task of our two armies. We firmly believe that in the future, the Armed Forces of the Union of Burma will continue to make contributions to the cause of defending the independence of their motherland and defending peace in Asia and the world."

General Tan Zheng said: "China and Burma are close neighbors, and our two peoples have a long-standing traditional friendship. In the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence, our two peoples have established deep feelings of mutual sympathy and mutual support. Since our two countries became independent, especially since the two countries jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, our friendship has made significant progress on a new foundation. What makes us even happier is that the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Boundary Agreement signed in Beijing in January by the Prime Ministers of the two countries reflect the common fundamental interests of our two peoples and have brought the friendly relations between our two countries into a new stage. This is a victory for the peoples of our two countries, a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has created a new model for the development of friendly unity among Asian and African countries."

At the reception, the guests and hosts toasted each other for the increasing friendship between the peoples of the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China, and between the Burmese Armed Forces and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Among those invited to attend today's reception were General Fu Zhong, General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Liu Shao Wen, Lieutenant General Qiu Chuangcheng, Vice Admiral Zhao Qimin, Lieutenant General Tan Jiasu of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Hu Qicai, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as more than one hundred officers from the army, navy, and air force units stationed in Beijing.

Also invited to attend the reception were Zhang Wenjin, Director of the First Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Zhang Youyu, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association. Military attachés from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    我国国防部副部长谭政大将应邀出席了招待会。
    会上，景沙门上校首先致辞。他谈到，缅甸武装部队在国家取得独立前，曾与人民一道抵抗法西斯主义；在缅甸独立后，保卫缅甸联邦及其宪法，成为缅甸武装部队的主要任务。他说，缅甸武装部队，还尽可能地致力于重建曾经被战争破坏了的国家，以及其他建国工作。
  景沙门上校说：“在缅甸武装部队与中国人民解放军中间存在的彼此友好和谅解，是不言自喻的。这种友好和谅解，一直是缅甸联邦与中华人民共和国的武装部队和人民之间的友好关系的基础。在这里我愿意提一下，我们两国最近签订的友好与互不侵犯条约和边界协定，将更加巩固与加强我们两国之间的传统友好联系、亲善与互相谅解。”
    我国国防部副部长谭政大将，在会上代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向友好的邻邦——缅甸联邦的武装部队致以热烈的祝贺。他说：“现在我们两个国家都在从事伟大的和平建设事业，我们需要一个和平的环境，因此，保卫世界和平、保卫各自国家的独立，就成为我们共同的奋斗目标，这也是我们两国军队的共同任务。我们深信，今后缅甸联邦武装部队，在保卫祖国的独立和保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业中将继续作出贡献。”
    谭政大将说：“中缅两国是亲密的邻居，我们两国人民之间有着悠久的传统友谊，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立的共同斗争中，我们两国人民就已建立了互相同情、互相支援的深厚感情。我们两国独立以后，特别是两国共同倡导和平共处五项原则以来，我们之间的友谊，在新的基础上又有显著的进展。更使我们高兴的是在今年1月间两国总理在北京签订的友好和互不侵犯条约和边界协定，反映了我们两国人民的共同的根本利益，使我们两国的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段，这是我们两国人民的胜利，也是和平共处五项原则的胜利，并为发展亚非国家的友好团结创造了新的范例。”
