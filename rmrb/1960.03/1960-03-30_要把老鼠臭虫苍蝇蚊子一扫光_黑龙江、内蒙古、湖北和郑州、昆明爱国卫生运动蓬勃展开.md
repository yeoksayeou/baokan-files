Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 27th. A spring patriotic health campaign to eliminate the "four pests" and promote hygiene is rapidly unfolding in Heilongjiang Province, from urban to rural areas. The momentum and scale of this movement surpass any previous year. According to incomplete statistics, over nine million people across the province have participated in the campaign so far, catching more than five million rats, eliminating tens of thousands of catties of overwintering fly pupae, and clearing 5.6 million tons of garbage, which has been turned into a large amount of fertilizer, closely integrating the patriotic health campaign with production.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has strengthened its leadership over the spring patriotic health campaign, recently holding a telephone conference to deploy new tasks. Local areas have reorganized the organizations for the patriotic health campaign, with the First Secretaries of Party committees personally taking charge in many places. Throughout the province, from government agencies to households, from cadres to residents, regardless of age or gender, a vigorous sanitation campaign is sweeping the land. Cities and counties like Harbin and Hegang have launched a large-scale competition to eliminate pests and diseases by organizing "health sports meetings," mobilizing people of all ages and genders. Harbin City has divided the city into eleven competition zones, organizing urban and rural people to carry out individual campaigns in nine areas, including rat extermination, pupae digging, toilet repair, food hygiene, and technological innovation, with great results. Many factories have divided their forces into two groups: one for production and one for hygiene; the city has already dug up more than 8,000 catties of fly pupae. Hegang City mobilized 400,000 people to participate in the spring health sports meeting from the 12th, organizing a propaganda army of more than 5,000 people to carry out propaganda and create momentum. On the 13th, 16,000 people were mobilized to carry out environmental sanitation, removing more than 1,200 tons of garbage and debris left over from the winter, eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, and filling in eleven large pits.

Many cities and counties have also actively strengthened the prevention and control of seasonal and endemic diseases. Qiqihar City launched a two-week sanitation campaign centered on the prevention of hepatitis from the 15th, widely carrying out preventive medication throughout the city, and promoting preventive measures such as washing hands before meals and after using the toilet, disinfecting tableware, and implementing separate chopsticks. In Shuangcheng County, many communes, due to early action and good preventive work, have basically had no infectious diseases since the beginning of spring.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 29th. A large-scale movement to eliminate the "four pests" and promote hygiene is vigorously unfolding throughout the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Yang Zhilin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made a mobilization report on the 28th at a meeting attended by cultural and educational secretaries of the League and Municipal Party Committees and party group secretaries of Inner Mongolia directly affiliated organs. Then, he and some leading cadres of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the secretaries and propaganda ministers of the League and Municipal Party Committees participating in the Autonomous Region's cultural and educational conference, totaling more than 1,000 people, inspected and participated in the work of eliminating the "four pests" and promoting hygiene in Hohhot City. On the 28th, more than 140,000 people in Hohhot City began a vigorous patriotic health campaign with great fanfare, extensive propaganda, the First Secretary in command, and cadres taking the lead.

Baotou City, where the movement to eliminate the "four pests" has progressed faster, has already had more than 500,000 participants in the movement centered on digging pupae and exterminating rats. Since mid-March, more than 130,000 rats have been exterminated. The streets and rooms in six districts and towns in the city are now basically free of rat holes. The Baotou Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the staff hospital, and the Qingshan District and other streets, with everyone working together, basically achieved the requirements of no pupae and no flies in a very short time. Citizens of all ethnic groups and teachers and students of higher education institutions in the city have also launched a major competition to eliminate the "four pests" with Hohhot City and various higher education institutions in the Autonomous Region.

In accordance with the spirit of combining symptomatic and radical treatment, various regions are vigorously repairing toilets and ditches and carrying out work to beautify the environment. After the patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases, factories and mines such as the Inner Mongolia Prospecting Machinery Plant, Baogang, and the Inner Mongolia Printing Plant have not only improved environmental sanitation but also greatly reduced occupational diseases.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 29th. The spring patriotic health campaign in Hubei Province, focusing on eliminating the "five pests" (rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes, snails) and eradicating the "five diseases" (schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, malaria, symptomatic syphilis), is unfolding vigorously. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires the First Secretaries of Party committees at all levels to personally take charge, strengthen leadership, and decided to organize a province-wide spring patriotic health campaign inspection in mid-April.

Shashi, famous for its sanitation work, has focused on renovating toilets, pigsties, ditches, and sewage pits since March, making several concentrated efforts to maintain hygiene in these places, eradicate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, and combined the movement to train all the city's service personnel, health workers, sanitation workers, cooks, and disease reporters once, further regularizing the sanitation work in public places. Cities such as Wuhan, Xiangfan, and Huangshi have also strengthened the leadership of the patriotic health campaign, actively taking measures to quickly launch a battle to整治 sewage ponds, dredge ditches, and improve environmental sanitation.

The patriotic health campaign in the vast rural areas is carried out in conjunction with spring plowing and production, and Party committees at all levels have strengthened the front line in the movement. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, 150,000 people in Guanghua County participated in the movement. Combining with spring plowing and sowing, they eliminated more than 50,000 rats, dug more than 600 kilograms of pupae, and accumulated more than 1.2 million tons of sanitary fertilizer in half a month. At the same time, more than 30,000 medical and health personnel were dispatched throughout the province, forming more than 10,000 mobile groups to go to the countryside to help various places carry out sanitation work. While publicizing health knowledge, they assisted various commune management areas and production teams in establishing more than 5,300 small hospitals, and went deep into canteens to help the masses improve dietary hygiene and environmental sanitation.

In order to push this movement to a new high tide, the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a special meeting to study and arrange it. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly issued a notice instructing all localities to do a good job in environmental sanitation with the spirit of eradicating evil, eliminate the "five pests" and eradicate the "five diseases," and make significant achievements in early April.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 28th. A mass patriotic health campaign with the battle cry of "Extensive Mobilization, Eliminate the Four Pests, Promote Hygiene, and Promote Production" has been forming a climax in Zhengzhou since the 25th. On the 26th, 200,000 people and cadres in Zhengzhou were mobilized to eliminate the "four pests" and carry out environmental and personal hygiene throughout the city. On the 27th, 16,000 people and cadres from Zhengzhou City and suburban counties held a swearing-in conference to eliminate the "four pests" and promote hygiene. Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on the entire Party and the entire people of Henan Province to completely encircle and suppress the "four pests" and launch a health red flag competition at the swearing-in conference.

On the 25th, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a Standing Committee meeting, and the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee and the Provincial Directly Affiliated Party Committee immediately made specific arrangements. Various directly affiliated units of the province and city held mobilization meetings overnight to carry out the sanitation campaign. In the afternoon of the 26th, Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Xing Zhaotang, Vice Governor of Henan Province, Li Qingwei, Liu Bi, Chen Wenshu, and other leading cadres of the provincial and municipal Party and government, together with 200,000 masses and cadres from Zhengzhou City, swept streets and roads, cleaned courtyards, cleared garbage, and washed clothes and disassembled quilts. The masses of Zhengzhou Brick Arch Street, a provincial health model street, took the lead again in the movement. On this day, they carried out a major indoor cleaning, cleaning and brushing, turning over boxes and cabinets, and painting walls. The Henan Provincial Public Security Department had more than 100 members of the Communist Youth League forming eight sanitation commando teams, going wherever there were difficulties and helping wherever there was backwardness.

The health, pharmaceutical supply, commercial, and other departments in Zhengzhou City also organized special personnel to provide sanitary and technical guidance and prepared materials for eliminating the "four pests." On this day, each district drew sanitary and technical personnel to form working groups, dividing areas to guide the renovation of pigsties, harmless treatment of粪便, and other work. The commercial departments sent 120,000 fly swatters to grassroots stores to supply the market.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 29th. Kunming City, which is like spring all year round, mobilized more than 350,000 people on the 27th, setting off a new upsurge in the patriotic health campaign, vowing to turn Kunming City into one of the cleanest and most beautiful cities in the country. On this day, according to incomplete statistics, the city cleared more than 600 tons of garbage, eliminated more than 4.43 million flies, and filled in more than 27,000 cubic meters of sewage ponds.

On this day, 203 propaganda teams and 25 propaganda vehicles, composed of more than 11,000 people, including medical and health personnel, literary and art workers, and university students, went to cultural and entertainment venues, stations, hotels, shops, and rural areas in the suburbs to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization work, inspiring morale. The patriotic health campaign in the city focuses on large-scale environmental sanitation, canteen sanitation, and the elimination of the first generation of mosquitoes and flies and mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Every household turned over boxes and cages, washed doors and windows, and thoroughly wiped from indoors to outdoors. The city's residential canteens universally washed and disinfected cooking utensils, cleaned the sewage channels around the kitchens, and added sanitary equipment.

Due to the great assault of the people of the city for one day, the environmental sanitation of the city basically achieved three cleans (clean indoors and outdoors, clean streets and courtyards, clean toilets and livestock pens), three cleanness (clean canteens, clean utensils, clean clothes and bedding), and one unobstructed (sewage ditches and sewers unobstructed).

    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　黑龙江省从城市到农村，正在迅速开展大除四害、大讲卫生的春季爱国卫生运动。这一运动的声势规模超出以往任何一年，据不完全统计，全省到目前为止已出动九百多万人参加了这一运动，捕获老鼠五百多万只，消灭越冬蝇蛹数万斤，清除垃圾五百六十万吨，增加了大量肥料，使爱国卫生运动和生产密切结合起来。
