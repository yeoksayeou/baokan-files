    Huang Huating Spends Four Years Developing Tamping Machine

    (Southern Daily News) Huang Huating, a well-known advanced producer in Shantou City, Guangdong Province, has recently successfully created an electric tamping machine after more than four years of research. This machine can replace the work of more than twenty tamping workers, freeing workers from heavy physical labor.

    Huang Huating is a young carpenter who only studied for seven months in the old society. He is now the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and leader of the production team of the Shantou City Construction Engineering Bureau. Before 1955, he knew nothing about machinery. However, he deeply understood that breaking through the tamping bottleneck was of great significance for liberating workers from heavy physical labor, improving the efficiency of tamping work, and accelerating the speed of construction. Therefore, he worked hard to study and learn humbly, determined to break through the machine manufacturing barrier. Through diligent study, he went from not understanding machines to being familiar with them, and from not understanding drawing design to being able to design. With the care and support of the Party Committee and the masses, the tamping machine was finally initially manufactured successfully on October 1st last year; subsequently, after matching components, the complete tamping machine was officially put into production on February 28th this year.

    This machine is small and exquisite, looking like a small tractor. The front of the machine is equipped with a 0.5 horsepower electric motor, and the middle part has a 25-kilogram tamping hammer. The operator sits on the seat at the rear of the machine and, with a flick of the switch, it can accurately move forward or backward at a distance of 8 centimeters per step. This machine can not only tamp walls of different specifications, but also tamp drying yards and foundations.

    After one hundred and three failures, Huang Huating's four-year effort to develop the electric tamping machine finally succeeded. Tamping is the most labor-intensive, most backward, and most physically demanding type of work in the Shantou area construction industry. Tamping workers have to hold a five-jin iron hammer, stand on two wall panels, and work all day, with each person only able to complete half a cubic meter of work per day, and the quality of the project is not guaranteed. Now, machines are replacing manual labor. The tamping workers are all very happy and praised: "Huating, you have done us such a great favor!"

    Those who don't know the details might think Huang Huating is some kind of expert, right? In fact, he is just an ordinary construction worker, a young carpenter who only studied for seven months. However, since 1953, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the masses, he has led the workers of his entire team to create and improve hundreds of tools, realizing the mechanization of backward manual operations; the whole team has exceeded its plan for eighty-three consecutive months, and he has been named a national advanced producer and has become a technical innovation expert.

    The Inspiration of the Anti-Encirclement Disc

    In 1955, Huang Huating visited the Anshan Technical Reform Exhibition in Beijing, where he was attracted by the anti-encirclement disc invented by Zhang Mingshan. At first, he thought it must have been created by a remarkable expert. But when he inquired, he found that Zhang Mingshan was just an ordinary worker, which aroused his immense feelings. As early as 1953, when he led a team working on a certain national defense construction site, the political commissar of the army pointed to the tamping workers who were working hard and said to him: "Look, how heavy the labor is, can you think of a way to improve it?" Huang Huating nodded at the time. He had also had this ideal in his heart, but when he thought that he was just a carpenter who had never even touched a machine, he felt that it was just a fantasy, and he never seriously thought about it again. But now, after visiting Zhang Mingshan's anti-encirclement disc and knowing that Zhang Mingshan was just an ordinary worker, he felt very ashamed and felt that his past thoughts were wrong. He said to himself: "Huang Huating, an ordinary worker can create such a remarkable machine, what have you done yourself?" On the way back, he made a special trip to visit the electric bricklaying machine created by Long Wenzhong in Wuhan. This machine can replace the work of eight workers, and Long Wenzhong is also an ordinary worker who has not even graduated from primary school. Back in Shantou, the heroic deeds of Luo Muming's technical innovation were also circulating, so his determination became even greater.

    In the Face of the Technical Peak

    After that, he took every opportunity to visit machines, learn to draw, and consult engineers, technicians, and veteran workers. His home was piled up with all kinds of drawings. He learned a lot about building machines. In 1955, he used the principles he learned to create more than ten kinds of vehicles, such as light wooden rail wooden wheel carts, enabling Shantou City construction sites to achieve vehicle-based transport in five days. He and the workers in his team also built more than ten woodworking machines, basically achieving mechanization for the entire team.

    But what about the tamping machine? There was still no clue.

    The difficulty was like a high mountain, standing in front of Huang Huating: to have a machine tamp walls, there must be power, but the distance between the wall panels was only 25 centimeters, and even the smallest electric motor was more than 30 centimeters, and there was not even enough space to install the power, what to do? He had many strange ideas, such as: since the electric motor could not be installed on the wall, use a person to carry it. This strange idea even made him laugh: "Huang Huating, how silly you are, are you trying to reduce or increase the intensity of the workers' labor?" He also thought about using a vibrator, thought about pushing it with a car... But none of these worked. In more than two years, he drew more than seventy drawings, all of which failed. By 1957, he began to waver, feeling that in the past few years, the leaders had been issuing recruitment notices every year, but no one dared to say "success"; engineers had been thinking for several years, but there was still no result; and he himself had been working on it for more than two years, but there was still no clue. "Don't overestimate yourself!" he thought. In the face of the technical peak, Huang Huating was a little timid.

    At this time, he was already the secretary of the Party branch. Every time he mobilized everyone to break superstitions and make innovations, or when he attended advanced producer meetings, he always felt a little uncomfortable in his heart. He thought: "I am calling on everyone to break superstitions and make innovations every day, but..." By the end of 1958, the task of construction projects became more and more arduous. Due to the small number of tamping workers and low efficiency, it was far from meeting the production requirements. A tense and heavy scene of manual labor appeared before his eyes again. He remembered what the secretary of the Shantou Municipal Party Committee had said to him: "Carrying out technical innovation and eliminating heavy physical labor is the second liberation of the working class, and advanced producers must shoulder this task." So, he could no longer bear it, and the sense of responsibility of the working class prompted him to make a firm decision again, and he would not give up until he had made a tamping machine.

    Hard Work

    In order to climb the peak, Huang Huating arranged his time: during the day and before 11 o'clock at night, he wholeheartedly did the work assigned by the Party, and in the depths of the night, he studied the tamping machine.

    At first, his wife, Zhou Chuwen, who had not been married for long, did not pay much attention to these things. She knew what kind of person her husband was and was proud of it. But later, she couldn't bear it anymore, feeling that if this continued for a long time, his body would collapse. But she couldn't dissuade him, so she simply turned off the lights. But Huang Huating quietly moved his things to the office, closed the door, and buried himself in his work again.

    How many sleepless nights had he spent for this electric tamping machine! Often in the middle of the night, he would jump out of bed and dismantle the light switch to explore the principles of electricity. He also often stood in front of the machine, pondering deeply, hoping to get some inspiration from it. One night, he saw a car parked on the street, which suddenly triggered a thought in his mind, and he immediately crawled under the car to observe it carefully. The car driver was startled, thinking he was a saboteur.

    Hard Work Bears Sweet Fruit

    Hard work finally bore sweet fruit. When Huang Huating drew the 104th drawing after 103 design failures, the design of the electric tamping machine was finally successful. At this time, it was already past 12 o'clock in the evening. Huang Huating took the newly completed drawing and, with a feeling of joy and anxiety, knocked on the door of engineer Lin Deji's room. Engineer Lin happily shouted while looking at it: "Good, success, success! This is really a big deal. The design still has some minor flaws, but it doesn't matter, it can be changed." That night, they talked until more than three o'clock. Engineer Lin found a lot of relevant technical books overnight and gave them to Huang Huating for reference, and also spent several days of his spare time helping Huang Huating to calculate and conduct scientific analysis, making the design of the tamping machine more perfect.

    The news of the successful design of the electric tamping machine quickly spread throughout Shantou City. The Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee called the workers of the Shantou Machine Tool Factory to help Huang Huating process parts; the Commissioner's Office of the Engineering Bureau sent a section chief to help Huang Huating find materials; carpenters and tamping workers held several discussion meetings to put forward many valuable improvement opinions on Huang Huating's design; many workers voluntarily gave up their rest time to help Huang Huating test-produce this machine. The responsible comrades and chief engineer of the Industrial Department of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Design Institute encouraged Huang Huating and also very enthusiastically put forward some opinions.

    The machine was made, and Huang Huating fulfilled a wish. However, a bigger wish is brewing in his heart. He wants to modify this machine to be more automatic, so that one worker can watch four machines; he plans to further realize automation on the basis of the team already achieving production mechanization.

    Let us wish him all the best!

    一零四号图纸的诞生
    南方日报记者　柯炳藩
    黄华庭苦钻四年制成夯墙机
    据南方日报消息　广东省汕头市著名先进生产者黄华庭，经过四年多的钻研，最近创造成功一部电动夯墙机。这部机器可以代替二十多个夯墙工人的操作，使工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。
    黄华庭是一个在旧社会只读过七个月书的青年木工，现在是汕头市建筑工程局党委副书记兼生产小组的组长。1955年以前，他对于机械这一门，是一无所知的。但是他深切地了解到突破夯墙这一关，对于把工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，提高夯墙的劳动效率，加快建筑施工的速度，具有很大的意义。于是他刻苦钻研，虚心学习，决心冲破机器制造这一关。经过刻苦钻研，从不懂机器到熟悉机器，从不懂绘图设计到能绘图设计。在党委和群众的关怀和支持下，去年10月1日，夯墙机终于初步制造成功了；随后，经过配套，整套夯墙机在今年2月28日正式投入生产。
    这部机器小巧玲珑，外表像一部小拖拉机，机身前部装有零点五马力的电动机，中部有二十五公斤重的夯锤，操作者坐在机器后部的座位上，只要一按开关，它就可以以每步相距八厘米的准确距离，随意前进、后退。这种机器，不仅可以夯不同规格的墙，还可以夯地埕和基础。
    经过一百零三次的失败，黄华庭搞了四年的电动夯墙机终于制造成功了。夯墙是汕头地区建筑业中工作量最大、操作最落后、劳动强度最大的一个工种。夯墙工人，要握着五斤多重的铁锤，双脚踏在两片墙板上，整天劳作，每天每人只能完成半个立方米的任务，而且工程质量还得不到保证。现在，有机器代人工操作了。夯墙工人都十分高兴地连声称赞说：“华庭，你为我们做了一件多么大的好事啊！”
    不知道底细的人，以为黄华庭是个什么样的专家吧？其实，他只是一个普通的建筑工人，是一个只读过七个月书的青年木工。但是，自1953年以来，他在党的领导和群众的帮助下，带领着全小组的工人，创造和改进了几百种工具，使落后的手工操作实现了机械化；全组连续八十三个月都超额完成了计划，他被评为全国先进生产者，成了技术革新的能手。
    反围盘的启示
    1955年，黄华庭到北京参观鞍山技术改革展览会，他被张明山发明的反围盘吸引住了。起初，他以为这一定是一个了不起的专家搞的。可是一打听，原来张明山只是一个普通的工人，这就勾起了他无限的感触。早在1953年，当他带领一个小组，在某国防工地上工作的时候，一天，部队的政委指着正在劳动的夯墙工人对他说道：“你看，多么笨重的劳动，能不能想个办法改善改善？”当时黄华庭点点头。他心里也曾经有过这个理想，可是一想到自己只是一个木工，连机器都没有摸过，便觉得这只不过是一个幻想罢了，从此就再没有认真去想了。可是现在，参观了张明山创造的反围盘，知道了张明山只是一个普通的工人，他心里觉得很惭愧，觉得自己过去的想法不对头。他对自己说：“黄华庭啊，一个普通工人能够创造这么了不起的机器，你自己呢，做了些什么？”就在这次归途中，他特地去参观了武汉龙文忠创制的电动砌墙机。这部机器可以代替八个工人的操作，而龙文忠也是一个连小学还没有毕业的普通工人。回到汕头，正好又流传着罗木命技术革新的英雄事迹，于是他的决心就更大了。
    在技术高峰面前
    此后，一有机会他就去参观机器，学画图，请教工程师、技术员、老工人。他家里，堆满了各式各样的图纸。他学到了不少造机器的道理。1955年，他利用学到的原理，创造了轻便木轨木轮车等十多种车子，使汕头市建筑工地五天就实现了车子化。他又和组里的工人一起，造了十多部木工机械，使全组基本上实现了机械化。
    可是，夯墙的机器呢？仍然没有一点门路。
    困难就像一座高山，横在黄华庭的面前：要机器夯墙，就要有动力，可是墙板的距离只有二十五厘米，而最小的电动机也得三十厘米以上，连安装动力的地方也不够，怎么办？他曾经有过很多奇怪的想法，比如：既然墙上安不上电动机，就用一个人背。这奇怪的想法连他自己也笑起来了：“黄华庭啊，你多么傻，你是要减轻还是要加重工人的劳动强度呢？”他也想过用震动器，想过用车推……但是，这些都不成。二年多来，他画了七十多张画样，都失败了。到1957年，他动摇起来了，觉得这几年来，领导上年年都出榜招贤，可就没有人敢说“成”；工程师想了好几年，也没有下文；而自己也搞了两年多，还是一点门路也没有。“不要不自量力了！”他这样想。在技术的高峰面前，黄华庭有些胆怯了。
    这时，他已经是党总支书记，每次在发动大家破除迷信、闹革新，或者当他参加先进生产者会议时，他心里总有点不自在，他想：“自己天天号召大家破除迷信、闹革新，可是……”到了1958年底，建筑工程的任务越来越繁重了。由于夯墙工人少，效率低，远远赶不上生产要求。一幅紧张的笨重的体力劳动的情景，又呈现在他的眼前了。他记起汕头市委书记对他说过的一句话：“进行技术革新，消灭笨重体力劳动，是工人阶级的第二次解放，先进生产者要把这项任务担负起来。”于是，他再也忍耐不住了，工人阶级的责任感，促使他狠狠地再下定决心，不制成夯墙机，决不罢休。
    埋头苦干
    为了攀登高峰，黄华庭把时间作了安排：白天和晚上十一点钟以前，他全心全意搞好党交给的工作，深夜里就研究夯墙机。
    最初，他新婚不久的妻子周楚文对这些情况还不在意，她知道丈夫是个怎样的人，并为此感到骄傲。可是后来她实在忍不住了，觉得这样长此下去，身体会累垮的。但是劝又劝不住，她只好索性把电灯关了。那知黄华庭悄悄地把东西搬到办公室，关起门又埋头干了起来。
    为了这部电动夯墙机，他熬过了多少个不眠之夜啊！常常在深夜里，他会从床上一跃而起，把电灯开关拆开，探索电的原理。他又经常站在机器面前，深思默想，想从中得到某些启发。有一天晚上，他看见街上停着一部汽车，突然勾起了他一件心事，立即就钻进汽车底下，仔细地观察起来，汽车司机吓了一跳，以为他是搞破坏的。
    苦战结甜果
    苦战终于结出了甜果。当黄华庭经过一百零三次设计失败画出了第104号图纸的时候，电动夯墙机的设计终于成功了。这时已经是晚上十二点多，黄华庭拿着刚完成的图纸，怀着又高兴又不安的心情，敲开工程师林德籍同志的房门。林工程师高兴得边看边喊：“好，成功了，成功了！这真是一件大事。设计还有些小缺点，没关系，可以改。”那一夜，他们一直谈到三点多。林工程师连夜找了很多有关的技术书籍，送给黄华庭参考，还用了好几天业余的时间，帮助黄华庭计算，进行科学分析，把夯墙机设计得更完善。
    电动夯墙机设计成功的消息，很快就传遍了汕头市。市委工业部打电话要汕头机床厂的职工，帮助黄华庭加工零件；专署工程局派了一个科长专门帮助黄华庭找材料；木工、夯墙工连续开了几次座谈会，对黄华庭的设计提了很多宝贵的改进意见；很多工人自动放弃休息时间，帮助黄华庭试制这部机器。省委工业部和省设计院的负责同志和总工程师鼓励黄华庭，同时也非常热心地提出了一些意见。
    机器制成了，黄华庭了却了一个心愿。可是，一个更大的心愿又在他心里酝酿着，他要把这部机器改得更自动一些，使一个工人能看四部；他打算在全小组已经实现生产机械化的基础上，再进一步实现自动化。
    让我们祝他一帆风顺！
