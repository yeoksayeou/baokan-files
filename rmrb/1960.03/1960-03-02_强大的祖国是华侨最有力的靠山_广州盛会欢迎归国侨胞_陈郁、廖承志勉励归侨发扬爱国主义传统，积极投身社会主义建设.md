Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 1st: A grand meeting was held today in Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, attended by more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province, to warmly welcome the overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland yesterday and on February 25 after suffering persecution in Indonesia.

The meeting was presided over by Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou.

At the beginning of the meeting, Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Guangdong Province, on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and the 38 million people of Guangdong, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the returned overseas Chinese. Chen Yu said, "A powerful motherland is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese. The motherland cares about the rights and interests of overseas Chinese everywhere, and overseas Chinese are no longer orphans abroad. Sending ships abroad to pick up overseas Chinese who have been persecuted in Indonesia is the most powerful proof of this." Chen Yu pointed out, "In the past ten years, more than 200,000 returned overseas Chinese in Guangdong have been properly resettled and are living a happy life of peace and contentment like the people of the motherland. Guangdong is one of the provinces with the largest number of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese. Relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese have made certain contributions in various construction projects, and many have become production experts and pacesetters." Chen Yu encouraged the returned overseas Chinese to continue to carry forward the fine tradition of loving the motherland, actively contribute their expertise to production posts under the unified allocation and assistance of the government, and devote themselves to socialist construction.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, spoke at the meeting, expressing a warm welcome to the returned overseas Chinese who suffered persecution in Indonesia.

Liao Chengzhi pointed out: "Since the second half of last year, under the instigation of imperialism, powerful groups in Indonesia have launched a countercurrent of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, attempting to divert the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and for democracy, and to undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The Indonesian people are opposed to anti-Chinese activities, and insightful people in Indonesia have also issued warnings. However, this anti-China and anti-Chinese activity has not stopped, causing a large number of overseas Chinese to lose their livelihoods and become displaced, and many overseas Chinese have been unreasonably detained. Our government and the people of the whole country are extremely concerned about the situation of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. This anti-China and anti-Chinese activity by certain powerful groups in Indonesia violates the principles of the Bandung Conference, the spirit of the Chen Yi-Subandrio Joint Communiqué and the treaty on dual nationality between the two countries; it also runs counter to the friendly tradition between China and Indonesia over the years."

Liao Chengzhi pointed out: "Our country is a socialist country where the working people are the masters. Our overseas Chinese are friendly envoys of our people and the people of countries oppressed by imperialism. Overseas Chinese are also a bridge for friendly cooperation between our country and all countries that are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. We believe that if disputes arise between countries that oppose imperialism and oppose colonialism, they can be resolved through friendly consultation with an attitude of solving the problem. The issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia is not only an internal affair of Indonesia, because it involves the livelihood and safety of a large number of overseas Chinese, which is a matter for both China and Indonesia. Only through negotiations can it be resolved in a way that is conducive to maintaining the friendly relations between China and Indonesia."

Liao Chengzhi said: "Our consistent attitude towards resolving the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese is: to resolve it through negotiations based on principles on the basis of friendly relations between the two countries. For overseas Chinese who have already integrated with the Indonesian people and have dual nationality, we understand and agree that they voluntarily choose Indonesian nationality, then they become Indonesian citizens and should be loyal to Indonesia and strive for Indonesia's national independence and construction. They should naturally enjoy the rights of Indonesian citizens and should not be subject to any discrimination. For overseas Chinese who wish to retain Chinese nationality, we hope that the Indonesian government can effectively protect their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with Article 11 of the dual nationality treaty." Liao Chengzhi also said: "We do not want all overseas Chinese to return all at once. We would rather see them stay in Indonesia and continue to contribute to Indonesia's construction, but Indonesia must respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Otherwise, if overseas Chinese are displaced and unable to make a living, and they are willing and ask to return to the country, we can only take measures to pick them up. We not only welcome overseas Chinese who are displaced and unable to make a living in Indonesia to return, but also welcome all overseas Chinese who are unwilling to continue to reside abroad to return to participate in the construction of the motherland."

Liao Chengzhi said: "The motherland is undergoing a great leap forward, vigorously developing industry, vigorously developing agriculture, and vigorously developing science and culture. We also need to immerse ourselves in construction for thirty or fifty years to lay a solid foundation for the long-term happiness of future generations. In order to make the socialist construction of the motherland more, faster, better, and more economical, we must build the country diligently and frugally, manage our homes diligently and frugally, and run all undertakings diligently and frugally. Diligence and frugality are precisely the tradition of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese need diligence and frugality to build a family and establish a career abroad, and national construction needs diligence and frugality even more. Therefore, the improvement of our lives must gradually increase with the development of production. Your return has increased the construction strength of our motherland. I hope that everyone will show their skills in construction and compare their enthusiasm, and bring the good experiences and technologies that they have accumulated over so many years of labor abroad into full play. We are building for the motherland, for the people, for ourselves, and for our descendants, and we must build it very well. The life you lived abroad is different from that in the country, and although you have some different living habits from your compatriots in the country, everyone can gradually get used to the new life. I hope that you will study hard the spirit of the people in the country relying on collective strength to do everything well, gradually get used to this new collective life, and further develop the traditional spirit of unity and patriotism that you had in Indonesia."

Liao Chengzhi said: "Everyone has seen that our country is now very prosperous, and it is becoming more and more prosperous every day. In the past, foreigners ridiculed us as a heap of loose sand. Mr. Sun Yat-sen talked about this matter and hoped to change this situation very much. Now we have organized all the people of the country. People's communes, state-owned farms, factories, mines, schools, and agencies are all organized. Organizing the strength of the people of the whole country in this way can build the country faster; the country can carry out production in an organized and led manner. This is precisely the great advantage of our socialist construction. Therefore, no matter where you go, you must learn to respect the leadership. The leadership is doing things for everyone and is our own people. We must respect and help them. We respect the leadership and approach the leadership, and the leadership will be more likely to form close friends with us and be able to take care of and help us progress. I hope that all overseas Chinese compatriots will continue to carry forward the patriotic tradition, actively work together with the people of the whole country in the great socialist construction, give full play to their expertise in planting tropical and subtropical crops, gradually become familiar with collective life, respect the leadership, love the collective, study hard, and continuously improve their cultural and ideological levels, and become construction experts of the country."

Jiang Xiaozhen, a returned overseas Chinese, on behalf of the Indonesian overseas Chinese who returned on the first batch of ships sent by the motherland, expressed his gratitude for the care and condolences of the people of the motherland. He said excitedly: "We overseas Chinese who have suffered persecution in Indonesia, through the care and help of the people of the motherland, have overcome various difficulties, and today we have finally ended the sad days overseas and returned to the embrace of the motherland." He said: "We have lived in Indonesia for generations, working diligently and shedding a lot of blood and sweat for the local economic development. The reactionary forces in Indonesia have persecuted us instead, which makes us very sad. But we know that we are no longer orphans overseas. The great motherland is our most reliable backing, and we are not isolated." Jiang Xiaozhen said that the returned overseas Chinese will never disappoint the hopes of the people of the motherland, and will work with the people of the whole country, go all out, aim high, and jointly build the great socialist motherland.

Luo Caixi, a representative of returned overseas Chinese students, also spoke at the meeting. He said: "The warm reception of the people of the motherland has moved many of our returned overseas Chinese students to tears. No dynasty has been able to protect and care for overseas Chinese like the new China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao today. We feel the pride and honor of living in the Mao Zedong era." He said that returned overseas Chinese students will definitely study hard, actively participate in labor, learn their skills well, and contribute everything they have to socialist construction in order to repay the care of the motherland and Chairman Mao.

After the speeches at the meeting, the Guangzhou Soldiers' Song and Dance Troupe performed wonderful programs such as chorus and dance.

Also attending today's meeting were Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Zhong Qingfa, Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Wen Minsheng, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese; Wang De, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese and First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee; as well as heads of various departments and people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and heads of overseas Chinese affairs departments in Fujian Province, Yunnan Province, and Shanghai City.

    强大的祖国是华侨最有力的靠山
    广州盛会欢迎归国侨胞
    陈郁、廖承志勉励归侨发扬爱国主义传统，积极投身社会主义建设
    新华社广州1日电　广东省各界三千多人，今天在中山纪念堂隆重举行大会，热烈欢迎昨天和2月25日回到祖国的在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的侨胞。
    大会由广州市市长朱光主持。
    会议开始，中共广东省委书记处书记、广东省省长陈郁代表中共广东省委、广东省人民委员会和广东三千八百万人民，向归侨们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。陈郁说：“强大的祖国是华侨最有力的靠山。祖国处处关怀华侨的权益，华侨再不是海外孤儿了。这次派船出国接运受印度尼西亚迫害的侨胞，就是最有力的证明。”陈郁指出，“十年来，广东已有二十多万归国华侨得到妥善安置，和祖国人民一样过着安居乐业的幸福生活。广东是一个侨眷、归侨最多的省份之一，在各项建设中，侨眷、归侨作出了一定的贡献，许多人还成了生产的能手和标兵。”陈郁勉励归侨们继续发扬热爱祖国的优良传统，在政府统一分配和帮助下，到生产岗位上积极贡献自己的所长，投身于社会主义建设。
    中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员、中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会主任廖承志在大会上讲话，对在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的归侨们表示热诚的欢迎。
    廖承志指出：“去年下半年以来，在帝国主义策动之下，印度尼西亚有势力的集团掀起了一股反华、排华的逆流，企图转移印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义和争取民主的斗争目标，破坏中国和印度尼西亚友好关系。印度尼西亚人民是反对排华活动的，印度尼西亚的有识之士也提出了警告，但是，这种反华、排华的活动并没有停止，使大批华侨丧失生计，流离失所，许多华侨被无理拘禁。我国政府和全国人民对印度尼西亚华侨的处境是极为关怀的。印度尼西亚某些有势力集团这种反华、排华活动，是违反万隆会议原则，违反陈毅、苏班德里约联合公报和两国关于双重国籍条约的精神的；也是和中国、印度尼西亚几年来友好传统背道而驰的。”
    廖承志指出：“我国是劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家，我国的旅外侨民是我国人民和被帝国主义压迫国家人民的友好使者，华侨又是我国和所有反帝国主义、反殖民主义斗争的国家友好合作桥梁。我们相信，反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的国家之间，如果发生争论问题，只要以解决问题的态度通过友好协商，都是可以解决的。印度尼西亚华侨问题不仅是印度尼西亚的内政问题，因为涉及到广大华侨的生计和安全的问题，这就是我国和印度尼西亚两国的事情。只有通过谈判来解决，才能有利于维护中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系。”
    廖承志说：“我们对解决华侨双重国籍问题的一贯态度是：在两国友好基础上，通过谈判，根据原则来解决。对已经同印度尼西亚人民融合在一起的、具有双重国籍的华侨，自愿选择印度尼西亚国籍，我们谅解和赞同，那他们就成为印度尼西亚公民，应当效忠于印度尼西亚，为印度尼西亚的民族独立和建设事业而努力。他们自然应当享受到印度尼西亚的公民权利，不应受到任何歧视。对愿意保留中国籍的华侨，希望印度尼西亚政府能够根据双重国籍条约第十一条，切实保护他们正当权利和利益。”廖承志又说：“我们并不是要华侨非都一下子全部回来不可，我们宁愿愿意看到他们留在印度尼西亚继续为印度尼西亚建设事业贡献力量，但是印度尼西亚必须尊重和保护华侨的正当权利和利益才行。否则，华侨流离失所，无法谋生，他们愿意和要求回国，我们就只能采取措施接他们回来。我们不但欢迎在印度尼西亚流离失所、无法谋生的侨胞回来，也欢迎所有不愿意继续在国外居留的侨胞回来参加祖国建设。”
    廖承志说：“祖国正在大跃进，正在大办工业，大力发展农业和科学文化事业。我们还要埋头建设三十年、五十年，为子孙万代的长远幸福打下牢固的基础。为了把祖国社会主义建设事业办得又多、又快、又好、又省，就得勤俭建国，勤俭持家，勤俭办一切事业。勤俭正是华侨的传统，华侨在国外成家立业，需要勤俭，国家建设更需要勤俭。所以，我们生活的提高，要跟着生产的发展逐步地提高。你们回来，给我们祖国增加了建设力量。希望大家在建设中显本领，比干劲，把在国外劳动这么多年琢磨出来的好经验、好技术，大大发挥出来。我们是为祖国、为人民、为自己和我们的子孙建设，一定要建设得很好。你们在国外过的生活和国内不同，和国内同胞虽然有一些不同的生活习惯，但大家是可以逐步习惯新的生活的。希望好好学习国内人民依靠集体力量，来办好一切事情的精神，逐步习惯于这种新的集体生活，把过去在印度尼西亚团结爱国的传统精神更进一步发挥出来。”
    廖承志说：“大家已经看到，我们的国家现在很兴旺，而且一天比一天兴旺。过去外国人讥笑我们是一盘散沙，孙中山先生就讲到这件事，并且很希望把这种情况改变过来。现在我们已经把全国人民都组织起来了。人民公社、国营农场、工厂、矿山、学校、机关，都是有组织的。把全国人民的力量这样组织起来了，就能够更快地建设好国家；国家就能够有组织有领导地进行生产。这正是我们社会主义建设的大优点。所以，大家不管到什么地方去，都要学会尊重领导。领导是给大家办事的，是我们自己人，我们要尊重和帮助他们。我们尊重领导，接近领导，领导也就更容易和我们结成知心朋友，更能够照顾、帮助我们进步。我希望各位侨胞，继续发扬爱国主义传统，在伟大的社会主义建设中和全国人民一道积极劳动，发挥种植热带、亚热带作物的专长，逐步熟悉集体生活，尊重领导，热爱集体，努力学习，不断提高文化水平和思想水平，成为国家的建设能手。”
    归侨江孝振，代表乘坐祖国派出的第一批轮船回国的印度尼西亚侨胞，对祖国人民的关怀和慰问表示感谢。他兴奋地说：“我们在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的华侨，经过祖国人民的关怀和帮助，克服种种困难，今天终于结束了在海外辛酸的日子，回到祖国的怀抱里来了。”他说：“我们世代居住在印度尼西亚，辛勤劳动，为当地的经济发展流了不少血汗，印度尼西亚反动势力反而迫害我们，这使我们非常难过。但我们知道，我们早已不是海外孤儿，伟大的祖国是我们最可靠的靠山，我们并不是孤立的。”江孝振表示，归侨们决不辜负祖国人民的希望，将和全国人民一道，鼓足干劲、力争上游，共同建设伟大的社会主义祖国。
    归侨学生代表罗才希也在会上讲了话。他说：“祖国人民的亲切接待，使我们许多归侨同学都感动得热泪盈眶。没有一个朝代，能够像今天共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国这样保护和关怀华侨。我们感觉到生活在毛泽东时代的骄傲和荣幸”。他表示归侨学生一定努力学习，积极参加劳动，学好本领，为社会主义建设贡献自己的一切力量，以报答祖国和毛主席的关怀。
    大会讲话结束后，由广州战士歌舞团表演了合唱、舞蹈等精彩节目。
    今天参加大会的，还有华侨事务委员会副主任方方、庄希泉、黄长水、庄明理，华侨事务委员会办公厅主任钟庆发，中共广东省委书记处书记、广东省接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员文敏生，广东省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员、中共广州市委第一书记王德，以及广东省、广州市各部门和各人民团体负责人，福建省、云南省、上海市侨务部门负责人等。
