Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 1st: A grand meeting was held today in Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, attended by more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province, to warmly welcome the overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland yesterday and on February 25 after suffering persecution in Indonesia.

The meeting was presided over by Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou.

At the beginning of the meeting, Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Guangdong Province, on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and the 38 million people of Guangdong, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the returned overseas Chinese. Chen Yu said, "A powerful motherland is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese. The motherland cares about the rights and interests of overseas Chinese everywhere, and overseas Chinese are no longer orphans abroad. Sending ships abroad to pick up overseas Chinese who have been persecuted in Indonesia is the most powerful proof of this." Chen Yu pointed out, "In the past ten years, more than 200,000 returned overseas Chinese in Guangdong have been properly resettled and are living a happy life of peace and contentment like the people of the motherland. Guangdong is one of the provinces with the largest number of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese. Relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese have made certain contributions in various construction projects, and many have become production experts and pacesetters." Chen Yu encouraged the returned overseas Chinese to continue to carry forward the fine tradition of loving the motherland, actively contribute their expertise to production posts under the unified allocation and assistance of the government, and devote themselves to socialist construction.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, spoke at the meeting, expressing a warm welcome to the returned overseas Chinese who suffered persecution in Indonesia.

Liao Chengzhi pointed out: "Since the second half of last year, under the instigation of imperialism, powerful groups in Indonesia have launched a countercurrent of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, attempting to divert the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and for democracy, and to undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The Indonesian people are opposed to anti-Chinese activities, and insightful people in Indonesia have also issued warnings. However, this anti-China and anti-Chinese activity has not stopped, causing a large number of overseas Chinese to lose their livelihoods and become displaced, and many overseas Chinese have been unreasonably detained. Our government and the people of the whole country are extremely concerned about the situation of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. This anti-China and anti-Chinese activity by certain powerful groups in Indonesia violates the principles of the Bandung Conference, the spirit of the Chen Yi-Subandrio Joint Communiqu√© and the treaty on dual nationality between the two countries; it also runs counter to the friendly tradition between China and Indonesia over the years."

Liao Chengzhi pointed out: "Our country is a socialist country where the working people are the masters. Our overseas Chinese are friendly envoys of our people and the people of countries oppressed by imperialism. Overseas Chinese are also a bridge for friendly cooperation between our country and all countries that are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. We believe that if disputes arise between countries that oppose imperialism and oppose colonialism, they can be resolved through friendly consultation with an attitude of solving the problem. The issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia is not only an internal affair of Indonesia, because it involves the livelihood and safety of a large number of overseas Chinese, which is a matter for both China and Indonesia. Only through negotiations can it be resolved in a way that is conducive to maintaining the friendly relations between China and Indonesia."

Liao Chengzhi said: "Our consistent attitude towards resolving the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese is: to resolve it through negotiations based on principles on the basis of friendly relations between the two countries. For overseas Chinese who have already integrated with the Indonesian people and have dual nationality, we understand and agree that they voluntarily choose Indonesian nationality, then they become Indonesian citizens and should be loyal to Indonesia and strive for Indonesia's national independence and construction. They should naturally enjoy the rights of Indonesian citizens and should not be subject to any discrimination. For overseas Chinese who wish to retain Chinese nationality, we hope that the Indonesian government can effectively protect their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with Article 11 of the dual nationality treaty." Liao Chengzhi also said: "We do not want all overseas Chinese to return all at once. We would rather see them stay in Indonesia and continue to contribute to Indonesia's construction, but Indonesia must respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Otherwise, if overseas Chinese are displaced and unable to make a living, and they are willing and ask to return to the country, we can only take measures to pick them up. We not only welcome overseas Chinese who are displaced and unable to make a living in Indonesia to return, but also welcome all overseas Chinese who are unwilling to continue to reside abroad to return to participate in the construction of the motherland."

Liao Chengzhi said: "The motherland is undergoing a great leap forward, vigorously developing industry, vigorously developing agriculture, and vigorously developing science and culture. We also need to immerse ourselves in construction for thirty or fifty years to lay a solid foundation for the long-term happiness of future generations. In order to make the socialist construction of the motherland more, faster, better, and more economical, we must build the country diligently and frugally, manage our homes diligently and frugally, and run all undertakings diligently and frugally. Diligence and frugality are precisely the tradition of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese need diligence and frugality to build a family and establish a career abroad, and national construction needs diligence and frugality even more. Therefore, the improvement of our lives must gradually increase with the development of production. Your return has increased the construction strength of our motherland. I hope that everyone will show their skills in construction and compare their enthusiasm, and bring the good experiences and technologies that they have accumulated over so many years of labor abroad into full play. We are building for the motherland, for the people, for ourselves, and for our descendants, and we must build it very well. The life you lived abroad is different from that in the country, and although you have some different living habits from your compatriots in the country, everyone can gradually get used to the new life. I hope that you will study hard the spirit of the people in the country relying on collective strength to do everything well, gradually get used to this new collective life, and further develop the traditional spirit of unity and patriotism that you had in Indonesia."

Liao Chengzhi said: "Everyone has seen that our country is now very prosperous, and it is becoming more and more prosperous every day. In the past, foreigners ridiculed us as a heap of loose sand. Mr. Sun Yat-sen talked about this matter and hoped to change this situation very much. Now we have organized all the people of the country. People's communes, state-owned farms, factories, mines, schools, and agencies are all organized. Organizing the strength of the people of the whole country in this way can build the country faster; the country can carry out production in an organized and led manner. This is precisely the great advantage of our socialist construction. Therefore, no matter where you go, you must learn to respect the leadership. The leadership is doing things for everyone and is our own people. We must respect and help them. We respect the leadership and approach the leadership, and the leadership will be more likely to form close friends with us and be able to take care of and help us progress. I hope that all overseas Chinese compatriots will continue to carry forward the patriotic tradition, actively work together with the people of the whole country in the great socialist construction, give full play to their expertise in planting tropical and subtropical crops, gradually become familiar with collective life, respect the leadership, love the collective, study hard, and continuously improve their cultural and ideological levels, and become construction experts of the country."

Jiang Xiaozhen, a returned overseas Chinese, on behalf of the Indonesian overseas Chinese who returned on the first batch of ships sent by the motherland, expressed his gratitude for the care and condolences of the people of the motherland. He said excitedly: "We overseas Chinese who have suffered persecution in Indonesia, through the care and help of the people of the motherland, have overcome various difficulties, and today we have finally ended the sad days overseas and returned to the embrace of the motherland." He said: "We have lived in Indonesia for generations, working diligently and shedding a lot of blood and sweat for the local economic development. The reactionary forces in Indonesia have persecuted us instead, which makes us very sad. But we know that we are no longer orphans overseas. The great motherland is our most reliable backing, and we are not isolated." Jiang Xiaozhen said that the returned overseas Chinese will never disappoint the hopes of the people of the motherland, and will work with the people of the whole country, go all out, aim high, and jointly build the great socialist motherland.

Luo Caixi, a representative of returned overseas Chinese students, also spoke at the meeting. He said: "The warm reception of the people of the motherland has moved many of our returned overseas Chinese students to tears. No dynasty has been able to protect and care for overseas Chinese like the new China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao today. We feel the pride and honor of living in the Mao Zedong era." He said that returned overseas Chinese students will definitely study hard, actively participate in labor, learn their skills well, and contribute everything they have to socialist construction in order to repay the care of the motherland and Chairman Mao.

After the speeches at the meeting, the Guangzhou Soldiers' Song and Dance Troupe performed wonderful programs such as chorus and dance.

Also attending today's meeting were Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Zhong Qingfa, Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Wen Minsheng, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese; Wang De, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese and First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee; as well as heads of various departments and people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and heads of overseas Chinese affairs departments in Fujian Province, Yunnan Province, and Shanghai City.
