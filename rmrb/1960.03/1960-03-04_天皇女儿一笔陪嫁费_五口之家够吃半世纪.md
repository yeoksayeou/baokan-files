The stark contrast between the extravagance of Japan's ruling class and the hunger and cold of the working people is evident today.

For the marriage of the Japanese Emperor's youngest daughter, Kazuko, the Kishi Nobusuke government actually decided to allocate 15 million yen from the national treasury as her wedding expenses. According to Japanese newspapers, in early 1959, the average monthly living expenses for a family of five in Japan was about 25,000 yen. Therefore, this sum is equivalent to fifty years of living expenses for a family of five.

    在今天的日本统治阶级的穷奢极侈和劳动人民的饥寒交迫形成了鲜明对比。
    为了日本天皇的小女儿贵子的出嫁，岸信介政府竟决定从国库中拨出一千五百万日元作为她的结婚费用。据日本报纸报道，在1959年初，日本一个五口之家的平均每月生活费用约需二万五千日元。因此这笔钱相当于一个五口人家庭的五十年的生活费用。
