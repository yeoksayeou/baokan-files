Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 18th: The American Communist Party sent a telegram to Eisenhower on March 17th, protesting the frenzied suppression of Black people by authorities in various places.

The American Communist Party said in the telegram: "The lives of millions of Black people in the American South are under threat. Their freedom is being trampled on by thugs led by the police." The telegram pointed out that the Orangeburg prison in South Carolina is already overcrowded with arrested people, and in other parts of the state, more than five hundred people are being arrested every day.

The telegram said: "In Montgomery, Alabama, and Tallahassee, Florida, mobs led by police blockaded the gates of Black universities and arrested students en masse. South Carolina Governor Hollings, Alabama Governor Patterson, and Georgia Governor Vandiver have stopped one-third of the residents of their respective states from exercising their constitutional rights.

"They are using force and threats of force to deprive Black people of the right to petition and the right to peaceful assembly. The governors of these states and many other authorities are using their positions to deprive American citizens of their constitutional freedoms and persecute Black people who oppose racial segregation and discriminatory illegal activities that exist in all aspects of life in the American South."

In the telegram, the American Communist Party demanded that measures be taken to protect the constitutional rights of Black people, immediately and unconditionally release all Black people arrested for opposing racial discrimination, punish officials who violate the constitution, and declare the White Citizens' Council, the Ku Klux Klan, and other racial terrorist organizations illegal.

    美共致电艾森豪威尔
    要求停止对黑人的疯狂迫害
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约18日讯：美国共产党3月17日打电报给艾森豪威尔，抗议各地当局疯狂镇压黑人。
    美国共产党在电报中说：“美国南部千千万万黑人的生命正受到威胁。他们的自由正受到警察率领的恶棍们的蹂躏”。电报指出，南卡罗来纳州的奥兰基堡监狱已经挤满被捕的人，而在这个州的其他地区，一天就有五百多人被捕。
    电报说：“在亚拉巴马州的蒙哥马利和佛罗里达州的塔拉哈西，一群暴徒在警察的率领下封锁了黑人大学的大门，对大学生大肆逮捕。南卡罗来纳州州长霍林斯、亚拉巴马州州长派特逊和佐治亚州州长范迪维尔已停止各该州的三分之一的居民行使宪法的权利。
    “他们使用武力和武力威胁的手段来剥夺黑人请愿的权利和和平集会的权利。这些州的州长和其他许多当权人物利用自己的职权来剥夺美国公民的宪法自由，迫害反对在美国南部生活各方面存在的种族隔离和歧视的违法现象的黑人。”
    美国共产党在电报中要求采取措施保护黑人的宪法权利，立即无条件地释放一切因反对种族歧视而被捕的黑人，惩办破坏宪法的官员，宣布白种公民委员会、三K党和其他种族恐怖组织为非法。
