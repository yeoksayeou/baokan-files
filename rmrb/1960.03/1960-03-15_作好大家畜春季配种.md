    Do a Good Job in Spring Mating of Large Livestock
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Animal Husbandry
    Spring is a good season for mating large livestock. Making a big effort in spring mating is the most important step in increasing the number of large livestock. Here are some scientific and technical experiences in mating work:
    I. Raise Good Breeding Stock and Improve Semen Quality
    Whether using natural mating or artificial insemination, it is essential to have breeding stock with strong mating ability and good semen quality. The main key to raising good male animals is to strengthen feeding management. Before and during the mating season, the feed given to breeding males should be easily digestible and nutritious. When the mating task is heavy, it is best to provide a certain amount of animal protein such as eggs, bone and meat meal, fish meal, etc. In addition, a portion of carrots, green fodder, salt, bone meal, clam shell powder or eggshell powder can be supplemented.
    If breeding males do not get enough exercise, sperm vitality is often poor. Therefore, breeding males should have appropriate exercise. Breeding bulls can do light hauling and traction exercises. Heavy draft horses should focus on cart-pulling exercises, combined with appropriate riding exercises. Light draft horses should use riding exercises.
    The frequency of mating and semen collection must be determined according to the different conditions of the breeding male. Breeding bulls should mate or have semen collected once every two to three days. If feeding management is good and the physique is particularly strong, the frequency of semen collection can be increased. Stallions can generally have semen collected once a day; under better nutritional conditions, semen can be collected in the morning and afternoon, with an interval of at least eight hours between collections.
    II. Mastering the Estrus Cycle and Mating at the Right Time is a Crucial Key to Achieving Full Pregnancy
    The purpose of mastering the estrus cycle is to select the most suitable mating (or insemination) time. The estrus period of cows generally lasts about one day; however, there are large individual differences. Ovulation time is about fourteen hours after the end of estrus. It is best to use two matings (or inseminations) in the later stage of estrus. If a cow starts estrus in the morning, she can be mated once the next morning and again in the afternoon, with an interval of about eight to twelve hours between each mating. Mating twice in one estrus cycle results in a higher conception rate than mating once.
    The estrus period of mares and female donkeys generally lasts five to seven days. The most appropriate mating (or insemination) time is about one day before the end of estrus. Because this is close to ovulation, mating is most likely to result in pregnancy. However, due to large differences in the duration of estrus between individuals, it is difficult to accurately determine the time of ovulation. Therefore, generally on the third day after the start of estrus, start mating (or inseminating) once a day until the end of estrus. In the past, some people believed that insemination after a mare ovulates was not very effective, but according to practice in various places, even if mating (or insemination) is performed twelve hours after ovulation, there is still a relatively high conception rate.
    In order to overcome the contradiction between mating and busy farming seasons, cows can be mated before work in the morning or after work in the afternoon. According to experiments in some places, the conception rate of mares mated in the morning is not as high as the conception rate of mating in the afternoon or evening.
    III. Seize "Heat Mating"
    Seizing heat mating means seizing the first estrus period after the female animal gives birth to carry out mating, which is especially important for livestock with longer gestation periods (such as water buffalo, horses, and donkeys). This ensures that a calf (or foal) is produced once a year. For example, Dongliu County, Anhui, reproduces water buffalo by seizing this key link, realizing one calf per year. Therefore, "heat mating" is also an important method to increase the conception rate.
    IV. Use Mixed Semen to Increase the Conception Rate
    According to recent test results from various places, using mixed semen to inseminate female animals can increase the conception rate. The Institute of Animal Husbandry of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Qixia County Artificial Insemination Station in Shandong used donkey semen with sperm killed added to horse semen to inseminate female donkeys to breed mules. The results of the trial showed that 101 female donkeys were inseminated with mixed semen, and the conception rate was 66.33%. 77 female donkeys were inseminated with horse semen alone, and the conception rate was 37.66%. The conception rate of mixed semen was 28.67% higher than that of single semen. In 1959, the Dehui Stud Farm in Jilin used mixed semen from two stallions to inseminate mares, a total of 7,480 mares were mated, and the results of examining 6,405 mares showed that the conception rate was 70.7%. Using semen from one horse, a total of 5,328 mares were mated, and the results of examining 3,500 mares showed that the conception rate was 55.1%. The conception rate of mixed semen was 15.6% higher than that of single semen.
    The weather is gradually warming up, which is the estrus period of female animals. It is necessary to seize this season and mobilize the masses to carry out mating work on a large scale.

Adopt Various Methods to Develop the Movement of the Poor Catching up with the Rich
Comrade Wang Shumao, Secretary of the Fenyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China
    After Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, realized the people's commune system, the county party committee felt that an important issue in consolidating and improving the people's commune in leading the specific practice of the commune was to bring the economic development level of poor management areas up to the level of rich management areas. Judging from the economic base in 1958, the average per capita income in the county was 66 yuan, with the highest reaching 80 to 100 yuan and the lowest below 40 yuan. There were 58 management areas with the lowest income, accounting for 21% of the total of 276 management areas in the county.
    Huge Changes After One Year of Catching Up
    In 1959, under the leadership of the county party committee, the party committees of each commune, in order to improve the economic level of poor management areas with income below 40 yuan, took establishing lofty aspirations and great ambitions as the guideline, inspired the masses' soaring enthusiasm, and launched the movement of the poor catching up with the rich. The plains area vigorously dug canals and wells, pumped water to suppress alkali, changed flood irrigation to furrow irrigation, transformed alkaline land, improved thin land, implemented garden-style cultivation, planted more high-yield crops, vigorously developed diversified economies, cultivated economic fruit trees, implemented intensive cultivation, and improved business management. Remote mountainous areas vigorously carried out water conservancy construction, diverted water up the mountains, changed dry land to paddy fields, implemented terracing, propagated large livestock, developed sideline production, and vigorously ran fruit processing factories. Stone mountain areas planted more potatoes, massively developed livestock, and vigorously developed pastures and sideline production. In economic and technical work, in addition to the rich management areas providing technical and material support to the poor management areas, the state also provided loans to support and assist. In the production process, the county party committee emphasized the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, thereby strengthening planning management, financial management, and labor management. Through the above series of specific leadership work, it promoted the earnest implementation of the principle of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in accordance with local conditions in each management area. After a year of hard work, there are now no management areas with income below 40 yuan, and most of the management areas with income below 60 yuan have also been improved. In 80% of the original 58 poor management areas, the average per capita income reached 80 to 120 yuan, and in the remaining 20% of the management areas, the average income of the commune members also reached 50 to 80 yuan. In 1959, due to the comprehensive organization of the movement of catching up, helping, and surpassing between the poor and rich areas, it guaranteed that the total agricultural income of the county increased by 15% compared with 1958; the average per capita income of commune members increased by 22%, and public accumulation also increased by 82%.
    Continuously Benchmark Against High Standards
    In order to achieve an even greater and continued leap forward this year, the county party committee convened a symposium for the poor catching up with the rich areas as early as December last year. In the symposium, it was discovered that some management area cadres believed that although they had achieved results after a year of hard work, they had not always caught up, showing a negative and relaxed attitude; the cadres who had caught up with the rich areas believed that they had caught up in only one year, and no more effort was needed to catch up again, showing complacency; the originally richer management areas, with the promotion of the movement of the poor catching up with the rich, became even richer, and also believed that their objective conditions were good and their material foundation was strong, others were catching up, and they were also moving forward, and they would never fall behind again. In order to eliminate these three ideas, the county party committee conducted a county-wide debate, and the people of the county established the firm belief of continuous revolution, continuous leap forward, and continuous benchmarking against high standards. On the basis of unified understanding, a mass-based survey and ranking of the income level of commune members last year was conducted. The county party committee proposed to continue the movement of catching up, helping, and surpassing this year, further improving the economic level of the management areas with an average per capita income below 80 yuan (accounting for 25% of the total number of management areas), and vigorously developing the commune economy. In the progress of the movement, in addition to adopting the successful experiences of last year, the county party committee vigorously promoted the spirit of continuous revolution and collectivism politically, carried out a mass movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, and thoroughly changed the face of nature.
    New Developments
    Judging from the development of this movement, three new organizational forms have emerged in the county's movement of the poor catching up with the rich:
    The first is cooperation between rich and poor management areas to build high-yield fields, high-yield ridges, and high-yield ditches on a large scale.
    This form breaks the boundaries of small-scale collective production based on management areas and develops towards a larger-scale collective production, which is conducive to enhancing the concept of the large collective and cultivating the habit of large collective labor. For example, the Flame Commune organized eight management areas, including Nie Sheng, to build a large-area high-yield field of 12,000 mu centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, and established a 10,000-head pig farm in the area, proposing a production target of 1,000 jin of grain and 150 jin of cotton (lint) per mu. At the same time, it adopted the management method of unified leadership, unified planning, unified indicators, unified measures, and unified labor arrangement, while implementing hierarchical management and each being responsible for its own profits and losses to vigorously carry out cooperation. Before the organization of the high-yield field, the four poor management areas such as Shang Wen only applied about 50 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and the water conservancy was in disrepair. After participating in the high-yield field, they also set off a production upsurge of learning from high standards in order to achieve the grand target of 1,000 jin of grain and 150 jin of cotton. More than 2,000 male and female commune members used the method of large digging, large rotting, large fumigation, large picking up, and large padding for fertilizer accumulation, averaging 155 dan of fertilizer per mu in half a month. At the same time, a canal was repaired, expanding the irrigation area by more than 3,000 mu.
    The large-scale construction of high-yield fields prompted 63 relatively poor management areas in the county to arouse the ambition to thoroughly transform nature, vigorously increase fertilizer application, and vigorously carry out water conservancy construction. At present, 45,000 mu of land in these poor management areas have participated in high-yield fields, high-yield ridges, and high-yield ditches, and the fertilizer application per mu has increased from 50 dan when participating in high-yield fields to 100 to 150 dan; irrigated land has expanded from 21,000 mu to 32,000 mu, while 8,000 mu of alkaline land has been improved, 9,000 mu of terraced fields have been built, and 1,500 pigs have been raised.
    The second type is the merger of small villages and poor areas (mainly in remote mountainous areas).
    In the new situation of benchmarking against high standards, the new problem brought about is that management areas with scattered villages, insufficient labor and livestock power, and shortage of funds have practical difficulties in all aspects of catching up, helping, and surpassing. In order to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to overcome difficulties and get rid of poverty as soon as possible, the county conducts necessary mergers of poor management areas with economic foundations close to equilibrium under the principle of voluntary combination, mass satisfaction, and benefit to production. For example, the four management areas of Xia Zhangjia Village and Xiehe in the Yudaohe Commune, less than five li apart and with less than 100 households each, have more than 30 administrative cadres in the management area alone, and their material and financial resources are extremely weak, and they are unable to carry out basic construction that is beneficial to the current production, which seriously affects the development of production. Now that they have merged into one management area, more than 20 cadres have been freed up to participate in production, 40% of the grain fields (4,000 mu) have been developed into high-yield ridges, terracing has been realized, and water has been diverted up the mountain to irrigate 2,500 mu of land. The wheat planted last year generally lacked base fertilizer, generally about 60 dan. After the merger, in order to make up for this defect, in just seven days, a large amount of artificial urine was produced, and 15 dan of green fertilizer per mu was applied to 3,000 mu of wheat fields, and all were rolled. Last year, due to the shortage of labor and livestock, 1,500 mu of autumn land was not cultivated; after the merger, 40 pairs of livestock were organized to complete all the cultivation within ten days. In terms of developing animal husbandry, a 5,000-head pig farm was established, and a livestock professional team of 1,000 sheep and 100 cattle was organized, with fixed personnel to lead and specialized personnel to graze, thereby changing the backward situation of the past where there was a shortage of labor, no one was in charge, resulting in the weakness and death of livestock. In addition, adhering to the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, a sideline professional team of more than 100 people was organized to engage in weaving, lime burning, and other sideline production all year round. In short, after the merger, all work has entered the ranks of the advanced. At present, 36 poor management areas in the county with relatively balanced production levels have been merged into ten management areas. Now, the production outlook is thriving and prosperous.
    The third type is to organize collaborative zones to implement contiguous collaboration.
    In order to enable areas with lower production and living standards to seek mutual support in technology and materials, and collaborative driving, three to five management areas are organized into a collaborative zone. For example, after the five management areas of Jiajiazhuang, Taiping, Dongsi, Beikuo, and Gufutu in the Wannianqing Commune formed a collaborative zone, the four management areas of Taiping, etc. lacked good breeding livestock, and the Jiajiazhuang area sent breeding personnel to regularly patrol and breed livestock. The Jiajiazhuang area is rich in nitrate soil and has many soil fertilizer resources, but there are no technicians to boil nitrate soil, and Gufutu sent people to teach technology and help build factories. In just one month of collaboration, the entire collaborative zone bred 22 heads of superior large livestock such as Dutch cattle and ancient rough horses, and 85 heads of superior pigs such as Soviet large white pigs and Berkshire pigs. At present, 35 management areas in the remote mountainous areas of the county have organized 7 fruit tree and forestry collaborative zones; 20 management areas in the plains have organized 5 fishery collaborative zones. In addition, 60 management areas in the county have organized 12 animal husbandry and sideline production collaborative zones. These collaborative zones, according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, implement the collaborative driving of learning from each other's strengths and complementing each other's weaknesses, which is a good form of jointly developing production, advancing side by side, and gradually eliminating the difference between the poor and the rich.
    The Spring Ploughing Preparation Work is Mighty
    The people of Fenyang County are very confident in realizing this year's production targets of grain, cotton, and oil because they have found the above-mentioned methods to achieve richer and richer, and since the beginning of spring, a new leap forward situation has emerged in the spring ploughing preparation work with a mighty momentum, full of enthusiasm, early start, fast speed, large quantity, and high quality. As of now, the average base fertilizer accumulation per mu of 560,000 mu of autumn fields in the county is 89 dan, more than doubled the 40 dan per mu in the same period last year, and now more than 80% has been sent to the fields. In water conservancy construction, 600,000 mu of land is guaranteed for irrigation, accounting for 85.7% of the annual plan of 700,000 mu. Of the 5 million jin of cotton seeds required by the county, 4.5 million jin have been selected, including 3.09 million jin of superior seeds; 1.65 million jin of grain seeds have been selected, finely selected, and turned over to dry. Doing a good job in spring ploughing preparation work has not only laid a material foundation for realizing the county's production targets, but also provided a strong guarantee for improving the production level of management areas with an average income of less than 80 yuan.

    作好大家畜春季配种
    中国农业科学院畜牧研究所
    春季是大家畜配种的好季节。大抓春季配种工作，是增殖大家畜最紧要的一关。现将配种工作中的几项科学技术经验，介绍如下：
    一、养好种公畜提高精液质量
    不论采用自然交配或人工授精，都必需有配种能力强、精液品质好的种公畜。养好公畜的主要关键，是加强饲养管理。在配种前及配种期内，种公畜喂的饲料应是容易消化和富于营养的。在配种任务较重时，最好供给一定数量的动物性蛋白如鸡蛋、骨肉粉、鱼粉等，另外还可补给一部分胡萝卜、青饲料、食盐、骨粉、蛤蛎壳粉或蛋壳粉等。
    种公畜运动不足，精子活力常常不好。所以种公畜应有适当的运动。种公牛可作轻挽及牵引运动，重挽马应以拉车运动为主，适当结合乘骑运动。轻挽马采用乘骑运动。
    配种及采精次数，必需根据种公畜的不同情况来决定。种公牛以二至三天配种或采精一次为适当。如饲养管理好，体格特别健壮，可增加采精次数。公马一般可每天采精一次；在营养较好的情况下，可在上午及下午各采精一次，中间至少间隔八小时。
      二、掌握发情期，适时配种是达到全怀的重要关键。
    掌握发情期的目的，是要选择最合适的配种（或授精）时间。母牛一般发情持续期约一天左右；但个体差异很大。排卵时间约在发情停止后十四小时左右。最好是在发情期的后期，采用两次配种（或输精）。如母牛在早上开始发情，可以在次日早晨配种一次，下午再配一次，每次间隔八至十二小时左右。在一个发情期中配两次，比配一次的受胎率要高。
    母马和母驴一般发情持续五至七天，最适当的配种（或授精）时间，约在发情终止前一天。因这时接近排卵，进行配种最易受胎。但由于个体间发情持续期差异很大，不易确断排卵时刻。所以，一般在发情开始后第三天，即开始每天配种（或授精）一次，至发情终止为止。过去有人认为母马排卵后授精效果不大，但根据各地实践证明，即使在排卵后十二小时配种（或授精），仍有相当高的受胎率。
    为了克服配种与农忙的矛盾，可在上午工作前或下午工作后为母畜配种。据有些地方试验，母马在早上配种，受胎率不如下午或傍晚配种受胎率高。
    三、抓“热配”
    抓热配就是抓紧在母畜产后第一个发情期进行配种，尤其对怀孕期较长的家畜（如水牛、马、驴）更为重要。这样才可以保证每年产犊
  （或驹）一次。例如安徽东流县繁殖水牛，就抓住这一个关键，实现了一年产一头牛犊。所以“热配”也是提高受胎率的一个重要办法。
    四、利用混合精液，提高受胎率
    根据最近各地试验结果，利用混合精液给母畜授精可以提高受胎率。中国农业科学院畜牧研究所及山东栖霞县人工授精站，用杀死精子后的驴精液加入马精液内给母驴授精，繁殖驴骡。试行结果，用混合精液授精一百零一匹母驴，受胎率为66．33％，用单独马精液授精七十七匹母驴，受胎率为37．66％，混精比单精受胎率可提高28．67％。吉林德惠种马场，1959年用混合两匹公马的精液为母马授精，共配母马七千四百八十匹，检查六千四百零五匹的结果，受胎率为70．7％。用一匹马的精液共配母马五千三百二十八匹，检查三千五百匹的结果，受胎率为55．1％，混精比单精提高受胎率15．6％。
    目前天气渐暖，正是母畜的发情期，必需抓紧这个季节，发动群众大搞配种工作。采取多种办法发展穷赶富运动中共汾阳县委书记　
  王树茂
    山西省汾阳县实现了人民公社化以后，县委在领导公社的具体实践中，感到巩固和提高人民公社的一个重要问题，是使穷管理区赶上富管理区的经济发展水平。从1958年的经济基础上看，全县每人平均分配的收入水平为六十六元，最高的达八十至一百元，低的四十元以下。收入最低的管理区有五十八个，占全县二百七十六个管理区总数的21％。
    追赶一年变化巨大
    1959年，各公社党委在县委领导下，为了提高收入在四十元以下的穷管理区的经济水平，以树雄心立大志为纲，鼓起群众的冲天干劲，开展了你追我赶的穷赶富运动。平川地区大搞挖渠打井、抽水压碱，改漫灌为畦浇，改造碱地，改良薄地，实行园田化，多种高产作物，大力发展多种经济，培植经济果木树，实行精耕细作，改善经营管理。边远山区大搞水利建设，引水上山，改旱地为水田，实现地埂化、梯田化，繁殖大牲畜，发展副业生产，大办果品加工厂。石山地区多种山药蛋，大量发展牲畜，大搞牧场和副业生产。在经济和技术工作上，除富管理区对穷管理区给予了技术的、物质的支援外，国家还贷款扶植帮助。在生产过程中，县委强调了勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，从而加强了计划管理、财务管理、劳动管理，通过上述一系列的具体领导工作，促使各管理区因地制宜地认真贯彻了农林牧副渔全面发展的方针。经过大干一年，现在收入在四十元以下的管理区已经完全没有了，同时收入在六十元以下的管理区也大部提高了。原来的五十八个穷管理区中有80％的管理区，每人平均收入达到八十至一百二十元，其余20％的管理区，社员平均收入也达到了五十至八十元。1959年一年由于全面组织了穷、富区的赶、帮、超运动，因而保证了全县农业总收入比1958年提高了15％；社员分配每人平均收入提高22％，同时公共积累也增加了82％。
  不断向高标准看齐
    县委为了今年再来个更大的继续跃进，早在去年12月份召开了穷赶富区座谈会。在座谈中发现有些管理区干部，认为大干了一年虽然有了成绩，但总是没有赶上去，表现消极松劲；赶上了富区的干部，认为只用了一年就迎头赶上，再赶也不用什么劲了，表现自满；原来较富的管理区，随着穷赶富运动的促进，富上更富了，也认为自己的客观条件好，物质基础雄厚，别人往上赶，自己也往前走，再也不会落后。县委为了消除这三种思想，在全县进行了全民性的辩论，全县人民树立了不断革命，不断跃进，不断向高标准看齐的坚强信念。在认识统一的基础上，对去年的社员收入水平进行了群众性的摸底排队。县委提出了今年继续赶、帮、超运动，把每人平均收入在八十元以下的管理区（占管理区总数的25％）的经济水平进一步提高，并大力发展公社经济。县委在运动进展中，除采取去年的成功经验外，在政治上大力发扬不断革命思想和集体主义思想，开展学先进、赶先进、超先进的你追我赶的富上更富的群众运动，彻底改变自然面貌。
    新的发展
    从这段运动的发展情况来看，全县穷赶富运动出现了三种新的组织形式：
    第一种，富管理区和穷管理区合作，大建丰产方、丰产梁、丰产沟。
    这种形式打破了以管理区为单位的小规模集体生产的界限，向一个更大规模的集体生产发展，并便于增强大集体观念、培养大集体劳动的习惯。如火焰公社组织了聂生等八个管理区以水肥土为中心，建起一万二千亩大面积丰产方，并在方内建立了万头猪场，提出了亩产粮食一千斤，棉花（皮棉）一百五十斤的生产指标。同时采取了统一领导、统一规划、统一指标、统一措施、统一安排劳力，同时分级管理、各负盈亏的经营方法大搞协作。在未组织丰产方前，尚文等四个穷管理区亩施底肥仅五十担左右，水利失修。参加丰产方以后，他们同样为实现千斤粮、一百五十斤棉的宏伟指标掀起了向高标准学习的生产热潮。两千多名男女社员用大挖、大沤、大熏，大拾、大垫的积肥方法，半个月平均每亩积肥一百五十五担。同时修渠一条，扩大了灌溉面积三千余亩。
    大搞丰产方促使全县六十三个较穷的管理区鼓起了彻底改造自然、大力增施肥料、大兴水利建设的雄心大志。目前这些穷管理区已经有四万五千亩土地参加了丰产方、丰产梁、丰产沟，每亩施肥已由参加丰产方时候的五十担，增加到一百至一百五十担；水地由二万一千亩扩大到三万二千亩，同时改良了碱地八千亩，兴修了梯田九千亩，养猪一千五百头。
    第二种，小村，穷区进行合并（主要是边远山区）。
    在向高标准看齐的新形势下，带来的新问题是村庄零散、劳畜力不足、资金短少的管理区，在赶、帮、超等各个环节上都有实际困难。为了集中人力、物力、财力尽快地战胜困难，摆脱贫困，全县在自愿结合、群众满意、有利生产的原则下，对于经济基础接近平衡的穷管理区进行必要的合并。如峪道河公社的下张家庄、协和等四个管理区，相距不到五里、户数均不及百户，仅管理区的行政干部即拥有三十多人，物力、财力极为薄弱，对有利于当前生产的基本建设无力举办，严重地影响了生产的发展。现在合并成一个管理区以后，腾出了二十多个干部参加了生产，40％的粮田（计四千亩）搞了丰产梁，实现了梯田化，引水上山灌地二千五百亩。去年下种的小麦，普遍底肥不足，一般为六十担左右。合并后为了补足这个缺陷，仅七天时间大搞人造尿、三千亩麦田加施返青肥每亩十五担，并全部进行了滚压。去年由于劳力缺、畜力少，有一千五百亩秋地未耕；合并后组织了四十犋牲口在十天内即全部耕完。在发展畜牧上，建立了一个五千头猪场，组织了千只羊、百头牛的畜牧专业队，固定了专人领导、专人牧养，从而改变了过去劳力缺、无人管、以造成牲畜瘦弱死亡的落后状况。此外本着因地制宜，就地取材的原则，组织了一百多人的副业专业队，常年专搞编织、烧石灰等副业生产。总之，并区以后各项工作都跨入了先进的行列。目前全县已有生产水平比较平衡的穷管理区三十六个合并为十个管理区。现在，生产面貌蒸蒸日上，欣欣向荣。
    第三种，组织协作区，实行连片协作。
    为了使生产生活水平较低的地区，在技术上、物质上求得互相支援，协作带动，即由三到五个管理区组织成一个协作区。如万年青公社的贾家庄、太平、董寺、北廓、古浮图等五个管理区组成了协作区后，太平等四个管理区缺乏优良种畜，贾家庄区即派出配种员带种畜定期巡回配种。贾家庄区硝土丰富，土化肥资源多，但没有熬制硝土的技术人员，古浮图就派人去传授技术，帮助建厂。协作仅一个月时间，全协作区即配了荷兰牛、古粗马等优种大牲畜二十二头，苏联大白猪、巴克夏等优种猪八十五头。目前，全县边远山区有三十五个管理区组织了果树林业协作区七个；平川有二十个管理区组织了渔业协作区五个，此外，全县有六十个管理区组织了畜牧、副业协作区十二个。这些协作区根据因地制宜原则，实行了取长补短的协作带动，是共同发展生产，并肩前进，逐步消失穷富差别的良好形式。
    备耕工作声势大
    汾阳县人民因为找到了实现富上更富的上述几种办法，实现今年粮食、棉花、油料的增产指标的信心很高，入春以来在备耕工作上出现了声势大、干劲足、动手早、速度快、数量多、质量高的新的跃进局面。截至目前，全县五十六万亩秋田每亩平均积底肥八十九担，比去年同期每亩四十担翻了一番多，现在送到田间的占到80％以上。在水利建设上，保浇水地达到六十万亩，占全年计划七十万亩的85．7％。全县需用的五百万斤棉籽，已经粒选出四百五十万斤，其中，优种三百零九万斤；粮食种籽一百六十五万斤，已全部进行了粒选、精选和翻晒。备耕工作搞的好，不仅为实现全县的生产指标奠定了物质基础，而且为提高平均收入八十元以下的管理区的生产水平提供了有力保证。（附图片）
