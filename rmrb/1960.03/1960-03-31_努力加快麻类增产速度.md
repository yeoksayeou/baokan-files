Efforts to Accelerate the Increase in Bast Fiber Production
Commentator of this newspaper

    Bast fiber crops are indispensable materials for industry, especially the textile industry, agriculture, and fisheries. For example, jute and kenaf are the best raw materials for weaving burlap sacks. With the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the volume of packaging and transportation of industrial products is increasing, and more burlap sacks and burlap are needed. Ramie woven into summer cloth clothes is cool, beautiful, and durable, and can generally replace three pieces of cotton cloth for wearing, which can replace part of the cotton cloth supplied to the market; it is also an important export material, and each ton of ramie can be exchanged for five tons of thin steel plate. Hemp can also be woven into cloth, made into ropes, and used to manufacture high-grade cigarette paper; hemp seeds have an oil content of 30%, which can be used for edible purposes, lighting, and also for manufacturing paints and soaps. The oil cake after oil extraction can be used as feed. Many farm tools and ropes on carts cannot do without hemp, and a rope traction machine requires 70 to 80 catties of hemp. The development of the aquatic products industry requires a large number of fishing nets and ropes made of bast fiber. Various hemp stalks are raw materials for papermaking and can also be used to extract alcohol, etc.
    After liberation, China's bast fiber crops have been greatly developed. However, the production of bast fiber crops is far from meeting the needs of the rapidly developing sectors of the national economy. Taking jute and kenaf as an example, the output in 1959 increased by more than six times compared with 1949, but it can only meet about 50% of the national demand in 1960. Other bast fiber crops also have this situation. This shows that the production of bast fiber crops is a weak link in current agricultural production. In order to quickly change this situation, we must resolutely implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, and develop bast fiber crop production at a high speed.
    Bast fiber crop production has a strong commercial nature, and the amount used for self-sufficiency in rural areas is also quite large. Therefore, when people's communes arrange bast fiber crop production, they should also implement the policy of simultaneously developing commercial production and self-sufficiency production. All communes suitable for developing bast fiber crop production should produce enough commercial hemp to ensure the completion of the state's commercial hemp purchase tasks. Experience has shown that doing a good job in bast fiber crop commodity bases is the fundamental guarantee for completing the task of commercial hemp production. It is recommended that leaders at all levels attach great importance to this, strengthen specific leadership, and vigorously provide material support to complete the task of commercial hemp production in every possible way. At the same time, people's communes and production teams should also actively arrange the production of their own collective hemp and members' hemp to ensure self-sufficiency of self-use hemp, otherwise it will affect the completion of the state's commercial hemp purchase task.
    China has a vast territory and many kinds of bast fiber crops. Almost every region is suitable for planting this or that kind of bast fiber crop. As long as we give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, we will definitely make a great development in bast fiber crop production. The people's communes are large and public, which is convenient for unified leadership, and convenient for planting bast fiber crops in large areas according to unified land use plans and in accordance with local conditions. In recent years, many high-yield fields of bast fiber crops have appeared in various places, and these experiences can be widely used in this year's bast fiber crop production. The pig raising industry is developing rapidly in various places, and there are more sources of fertilizer after the harvest, which is also conducive to changing the fertilization of bast fiber crop fields. We should make good use of these favorable conditions and strive for a great leap forward in bast fiber crop production.
    At present, the most central issue is to appropriately expand the planting area of bast fiber crops according to the needs of the state and the commune, to ensure the completion of the planned sown area; and on this basis, to strive to increase the yield per unit area and to develop bast fiber crop production at a high speed. Some people are afraid that expanding bast fiber crop fields will affect grain production. In fact, in a province or a county, even if the bast fiber crop fields are expanded, the cultivated area they occupy is very limited. Moreover, a large amount of wasteland has been reclaimed in various places this year. Under the condition of greatly expanding the grain area, appropriately expanding the area of bast fiber crop fields will not affect grain production. Jiangsu has expanded the area of bast fiber crop fields this year, but the area of bast fiber crop fields only accounts for about 1.2% of the cultivated area. The province has made up its mind to strive to greatly increase the yield of bast fiber crops with a small amount of cultivated land, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in bast fiber crop use in the province. Last year, the planting area of hemp in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province was more than 20,000 mu. This year, by checking the land, a large amount of old hemp land that had been converted to other crops was found, and the area of hemp fields jumped to 60,000 mu. This also shows that as long as the leadership is determined and arranged well, the planned planting area of bast fiber crops can be completed. At present, the most urgent task is to quickly implement the planting area of bast fiber crops to the production teams and to the plots of land. In Zhejiang Province, more than 90% of the jute area has been implemented to the plots of land. Other places should also do this quickly.
    On the basis of ensuring the completion of the planned planting area, vigorously increasing the yield per unit area of bast fiber crop fields is the decisive link in this year's leap forward in bast fiber crop production. The key lies in vigorously carrying out the movement of high-yield plots and high-yield fields of bast fiber crops, and implementing centralized and large-scale planting. At present, the layout of bast fiber crop fields in some areas is still too scattered, which will seriously affect the increase of yield per unit area of bast fiber crop fields, and it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments. There are many benefits to concentrating bast fiber crop fields in large areas. First, it can attract the attention of leaders and the masses at all levels, can uniformly formulate production increase measures, and carry out the basic construction of bast fiber crop fields with high standards, so as to achieve intensive cultivation and comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. After the communization of Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, 57,000 mu of jute land was adjusted, changing the past situation of scattered jute land and inconvenient management. Forty-two canals were built in the jute area to overcome drought, and the "Eight-Character Charter" was conscientiously implemented in every production link. In 1959, the yield per mu of more than 200,000 mu of jute in the county reached as high as 700 catties, which was more than 1.3 times higher than the average yield per mu of jute in the country. If the area of various high-yield plots of bast fiber crops can reach two-thirds of the total planting area this year, and various measures are taken to vigorously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and carefully cultivate and manage them, so that the output of these high-yield plots reaches 80% of the total output, and the remaining 20% of the task is completed by other bast fiber crop fields, it will be relatively easy.
    At present, the comprehensive sowing period of bast fiber crops is not far away. We should strengthen the specific leadership of bast fiber crop production. If the tasks have not been implemented, we should quickly implement them to the production units and to the plots of land. At the same time, we should prepare seeds, fertilizers, medicines and machinery, sowing tools, strengthen technical training, and do a good job in the preparation of bast fiber crop fields, so as to ensure the completion of the planned sowing area of bast fiber crop fields, improve the quality of sowing, and create a good start for the leap forward of this year's bast fiber crop production.

    努力加快麻类增产速度
    本报评论员
    麻类是工业特别是纺织工业、农业、渔业所不可缺少的物资。例如黄麻、洋麻是纺织麻袋最好的原料。随着工农业生产的持续跃进，工业产品的包装运输量越来越大，需要的麻袋和麻包布也越来越多。苎麻织成的夏布衣服凉爽、美观、耐穿，一般可顶三件棉布衣服穿用，可代替部分棉布供应市场；它又是重要的出口物资，每一吨苎麻，可换回五吨薄钢板。大麻也可以织布，做绳索，制造高级卷烟纸；大麻子含油率达到30％，可作食用、点灯，还可制造油漆、肥皂，榨完油后的油粕可作饲料。许多农具和大车上的绳索离不开麻，一台绳索牵引机就需麻七十至八十斤。水产业的发展，需要大量麻类纤维制成的渔网和绳索等捕捞工具。各种麻秆是造纸的原料，还可以提炼酒精，等等。
    解放后，我国麻类得到了很大的发展。但是，麻类的生产远远不能满足国民经济各部门飞跃发展的需要。以黄洋麻为例，1959年的生产量比1949年增长了六倍多，但仅能满足1960年国家需要量的50％左右。其他麻类也有这种情况。这说明，麻类生产是当前农业生产中的一个薄弱环节。为了迅速改变这个局面，必须坚决贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针，高速度地发展麻类生产。
    麻类生产的商品性强，农村自用的数量也相当大。所以人民公社在安排麻类生产的时候，还应当贯彻执行商品性生产与自给性生产同时并举的方针。一切适于发展麻类生产的公社都要生产足够的商品麻，保证完成国家商品麻的收购任务。经验证明，搞好麻类商品基地是完成商品麻生产任务的根本保证，建议各级领导予以高度重视，加强具体领导，并大力给以物资支援，千方百计地完成商品麻生产任务。与此同时，人民公社和生产队也要对自己的集体用麻和社员用麻的生产积极加以安排，保证自用麻的自给，否则就会影响国家商品麻收购任务的完成。
    我国土地辽阔，麻类繁多，差不多每个地区都适宜种植这种或那种麻类作物，只要我们充分发挥人民公社的优越性，就一定能使麻类生产来一个大发展。人民公社既大且公，便于统一领导，便于按照统一的土地利用规划，因地制宜地、大面积地成片种植麻类作物。几年来，各地出现了不少麻类高产田，在今年的麻类生产中可以广泛运用这些经验。各地的养猪业正在大发展，伏后肥料来源更多了，这也有利于改变麻田的施肥情况。我们应当很好地利用这些有利条件，力争麻类生产大跃进。
    当前，最中心的问题是按照国家要求和公社的需要适当扩大麻类种植面积，保证完成计划播种面积；并且在这个基础上，努力提高单位面积产量，高速度发展麻类生产。有人怕扩大了麻田会影响粮食增产。其实，在一省一县来说，麻田即使扩大一些，它所占耕地面积也很有限，况且今年各地都开垦了大量荒地，在大量扩大粮食面积的条件下，适当扩大麻田面积，是不会影响粮食增产的。江苏今年扩大麻田面积较多，麻田面积也仅占耕地面积的1．2％左右，该省已下决心，力争利用少量的耕地大大提高麻的产量，做到省内用麻自给。山西长治市去年大麻种植面积是二万多亩，今年通过查土地，找出大量改种了别的作物的老麻地，麻田面积一跃而增加到六万亩。这也说明只要领导决心大，安排得好，麻类计划种植面积是可以完成的。目前，最迫切的任务是迅速地将麻类种植面积，落实到生产队，落实到地块。浙江省已有90％以上的黄麻面积落实到了地块。其他各地也应当赶快这样做。
    在保证完成计划种植面积的基础上，大力提高麻田单位面积产量，是今年麻类生产跃进的决定性环节。关键在于大搞麻类丰产方、丰产田运动，实行集中成片种植。目前，有些地区麻田布局仍过于零星、分散，这将严重地影响麻田单位面积产量的提高，有必要进行合理调整。麻田集中成片的好处很多，首先可以引起各级领导和群众的重视，可以统一制定增产措施，高标准地进行麻田基本建设，做到精耕细作，全面地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。浙江萧山县公社化后调整黄麻地五万七千亩，改变了过去麻地分散、管理不便的局面，麻区内兴修渠道四十二条，战胜了干旱，每个生产环节都认真贯彻了“八字宪法”，1959年全县二十多万亩黄麻亩产高达七百斤，比全国黄麻每亩平均产量高一点三倍多。如果今年各种麻类丰产片的面积能达到总种植面积的三分之二，采取各种措施，大力贯彻农业“八字宪法”，精心培育管理，使这些丰产片的产量达到总产量的80％，其余20％的任务由其他麻田来完成，就比较容易了。
    目前离麻类全面播种期不远了，应当加强对麻类生产的具体领导，任务还没有落实的，要赶快落实到生产单位，落实到地块，同时作好种子、肥料、药械、播种工具的准备，加强技术训练，做好麻田整理，保证完成麻田播种面积计划，提高播种质量，给今年的麻类生产的跃进创造一个良好开端。
