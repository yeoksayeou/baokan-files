Xinhua News Agency, Hefei - Steel workers from Ma'anshan, Longyan, Dalian, and Tangshan are responding to the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, guaranteeing increased steel production in the first quarter.

    Ma'anshan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company is enthusiastically responding to the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, guaranteeing to complete the production plans for steel, iron, steel products, and ore for the first quarter ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule.
    Their specific measures are: 1. Adhere to putting politics in command, with leading cadres going to the front line to mobilize the masses to find key issues, break through weak links, and vigorously engage in technological innovation and revolution, aiming to achieve transportation vehicleization and loading and unloading mechanization in March. 2. Conduct technical upgrades on the hot blast stoves of existing small blast furnaces to increase wind temperature and rationally adjust the blowers; implement blower parallel operation for large blast furnaces, modify the curvature of air ducts to reduce resistance, and increase air volume. 3. In steelmaking, vigorously promote the advanced operating experience of the National Converter Technology Performance Team and the Shanghai Furnace Lining Technology Performance Team. 4. Strengthen local methods of ore dressing to increase the iron content of sintered ore, and the pellet ore that has been successfully trial-produced will be officially put into production in March. 5. In coking, carry out the "Five Quicks" movement of quick unloading, quick washing, quick drying, quick loading, and quick refining, strengthen the management of coal washing and crushing, improve coke quality, increase coke yield, and save coal consumption. 6. In steel rolling, carry out the "Fourizations" movement of mechanized operation, enclosed rolling mills, roller conveyorization, and high-speed steel heating.
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company achieved a flying start in January this year and achieved complete success in February.
    Longyan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, workers from the First and Second Iron and Steel Plants of Longyan Iron and Steel Company are actively responding to the initiative of the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, resolutely guaranteeing to complete the first quarter's steel production plan four to seven days ahead of schedule.
    Since the beginning of this year, thanks to vigorous technological innovations, the degree of mechanization in transportation, loading and unloading, and ore processing in these two factories has reached over 75%. To achieve high output, high quality, and low cost, workers recently converted acidic iron-melting furnaces to alkaline iron-melting furnaces and adopted a series of effective measures to improve iron-melting efficiency. They are determined to increase the average daily output of pig iron in March by 34.59% compared to February, and the average daily output of steel ingots by 62.5% compared to February.
    Dalian
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, workers of Dalian Steel Plant are responding to the initiative of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, guaranteeing to complete the first quarter's steel and steel products production plans six and ten days ahead of schedule respectively, and making full preparations for the second quarter's production.
    To achieve this goal, all workers in the plant have enthusiastically launched technical performance competitions between shifts, furnaces, and groups, vigorously promoting dozens of effective advanced experiences such as rapid steelmaking and rapid steel rolling. Factory leaders have gone deep into the front lines of production, participating in labor while leading production, and making every effort to focus on daily and shift plans. At the same time, the entire plant is also launching a technological innovation movement and strengthening management work targeting the current key production issues, to ensure the early completion of various technical and economic indicators in the first quarter.
    The production situation in this factory has been very good since the beginning of this year. The production plans for steel and steel products in January and February have been completed ahead of schedule, and the average daily output of steel in February increased by 3% compared to January.
    Tangshan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, workers of Tangshan Steel Plant are enthusiastically responding to the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, resolutely guaranteeing the comprehensive early completion of the first quarter's production plan, and preparing for the second quarter's production.
    In recent days, workers at Tangshan Steel Plant have widely discussed the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. Workers in the converter steelmaking workshop proposed to guarantee the completion of the first quarter's steel production plan four and a half days ahead of schedule, with a steel qualification rate of 99.5%. Workers from the three steel rolling workshops, who completed the February steel production plan one day and eight hours ahead of schedule and increased the daily steel production level by 13.5% compared to January, proposed to guarantee the completion of the first quarter's steel production plan nine and a half days ahead of schedule. Currently, all workers in the plant are enthusiastically launching a mass-based battle to tackle key problems existing in the iron-melting furnaces and converters, and have achieved preliminary results.
    Leading cadres at all levels, in the spirit of grasping firmly and urgently, have further strengthened the organization and leadership of production. From the factory to the workshops, systems for directing and inspecting production on a shift-by-shift and furnace-by-furnace basis have been established and improved to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of production plans on a daily and shift basis.

    马鞍山、龙烟、大连、唐山钢铁战士响应石钢倡议
    保证首季增产更多钢铁
    马鞍山
    据新华社合肥电　马鞍山钢铁公司热烈响应石景山钢铁公司的倡议，保证提前十天到十五天，完成第一季度的钢、铁、钢材和矿石的生产计划。
    他们的具体措施是：一、坚持政治挂帅，领导干部亲临第一线，深入发动群众找关键，突破薄弱环节，大闹技术革新和技术革命，在3月份要实现运输车子化，装卸机械化。二、对现有小高炉的热风炉进行技术改造，提高风温，合理地调整风机；对大高炉实行风机并联，改造风管弯度，减少阻力，提高风量。三、在炼钢方面，大力推行全国转炉技术表演队和上海炉衬技术表演队的先进操作经验。四、加强土法选矿，提高烧结矿的含铁量，已经试制成功的球团矿要在3月份正式投入生产。五、在炼焦方面，开展快卸快洗快干快装快炼的“五快”运动，加强洗煤碎煤的管理，提高焦炭质量，提高出焦率，节约用煤。六、在轧钢方面，开展操作机械化、轧机围盘化、输送辊道化、烘钢高速化的“四化”运动。
    马鞍山钢铁公司在今年1月份取得了开门红的胜利，2月份又取得了生产满堂红。
