Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 10th: The delegates to the German Communist Party Congress, held in the Cologne region of West Germany in the first half of February, wrote a letter to the CPSU Central Committee, all Soviet communists and the people of the Soviet Union, extending fraternal combat greetings.

The letter was broadcast by "Free Radio 904 of Germany." It said that West German communists look to the future with hope, because they believe that their struggle is in line with the interests of peace and democracy of the West German people, and in this struggle they are united with the German Democratic Republic and the entire powerful camp of peace and socialism.

The delegates to the congress pointed out that in their struggle, the experience of the international workers' movement, especially the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is successfully building communism in the Soviet Union, is of great help to them.

The letter concludes by saying: Glory to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee! Long live the friendship between the peoples of Germany and the Soviet Union!
