Potatoes Irradiated with Rays Can Be Preserved for Two to Three Years; New Superior Breeds of Poultry Cultivated Using Blood Transfusion Method

Moscow has begun construction of the first mechanized potato irradiation facility. This year, it can use two types of radiation to treat 25,000 tons of potatoes, allowing them to be preserved for two to three years without spoilage or sprouting.

The facility includes several large warehouses and uses waste materials from the atomic industry. The entire processing is mechanized.

It is well known that potatoes generally sprout and spoil in early spring, making them difficult to preserve. The Institute of Biochemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has found a fundamental solution to this problem. They irradiate potatoes with small doses of gamma rays, and as a result, the potatoes can be preserved for two to three years without any spoilage, and they will not sprout even under the most unfavorable storage conditions.

Soviet scientists used the method of nutritional hybridization to infuse blood from turkeys into Russian White chickens for several generations, cultivating breeds with new characteristics not found in Russian White chickens.

The plumage color of the second generation of hybrid breeds has already changed, resembling the plumage color of turkeys. After several generations, the weight significantly increased, the legs became longer, and there were some changes in the shape of the beak. The aim of the experiment is to establish a new breed that can inherit the advantages of both parents—turkeys and Russian White chickens.

Blood transfusion is a type of nutritional hybridization in poultry farming, researched by Sopikov, a staff member of the Leningrad Branch of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Poultry Industry. Sopikov's work proves that nutritional hybridization is also possible in animal husbandry, thereby showing that Michurin's scientific prediction is correct.

Leningrad designers have completed research on the mechanization of kelp harvesting and have begun work on the blueprints for such machinery.

This specialized underwater crop harvesting device is located under a small boat. As these devices move underwater, they can cut or uproot underwater crops such as kelp and load the harvested crops into a specially designed net-like container.

Because seaweed is not easy to preserve, fresh seaweed can only be kept for three days. Therefore, floating factories are also established as offshore bases to process the seaweed harvested by harvesting vessels in a timely manner at sea. The base factory is a large, shallow-draft ship that can travel in shallow water and receive and process hundreds of tons of seaweed per day and night.

Kelp and other algae are gaining increasingly widespread use in the Soviet Union. The products of these marine plants are not only used to make canned goods, ice cream, fruit cakes, bread, and wine, but also to make penicillin and waterproof cloth. In addition, algae and its processed products are also used in the production of textiles, leather making, petroleum, animal husbandry, and many sectors of the national economy.

    马铃薯被射线照射可保存两三年  用输血法培育家禽新的优良品种
    莫斯科已开始建造第一座机械化马铃薯辐射装置。它今年可以用两种射线处理二万五千吨马铃薯，使它们保存两三年而不变味和出芽。
    这个装置包括几个大仓库，使用原子工业的废料，整个处理过程都是机械化的。
    大家知道，马铃薯在初春一般都会出芽和变味，不易保存。苏联科学院生物化学研究所找到了根本解决这一问题的方法。他们用小剂量丙种射线照射马铃薯，结果马铃薯可以保存两三年而一点不变味，甚至在最不利于储存的条件下也不会出芽。
    苏联科学家利用营养杂交法给俄罗斯白鸡连续几代输入吐绶鸡血液，培育出了带有俄罗斯白鸡所没有的新特征的品种。
    杂交品种第二代羽色就已经变了，类似吐绶鸡羽色。几代以后，重量显著增加，腿变长了，喙形也有一些变化。试验的目的是建立一种可以继承其双亲——吐绶鸡和俄罗斯白鸡的优点的新品种。
    输血是养禽业营养杂交的一种，是全苏养禽业科学研究所列宁格勒分所工作人员索皮科夫研究出来的。索皮科夫的工作证明，营养杂交在畜牧业中也是可能的，从而表明米丘林的科学预见是正确的。
    列宁格勒设计师们已经完成了海带收获工作机械化的研究，并已着手于这种机械的草图绘制工作。
    这种特制的海底作物收获装置在一个小艇下。这些装置在水底移动时，就可以割下或者拔出海带之类的海底作物，并把收获的作物装到一个特制的网袋状容器里。
    由于海菜不易保存，新鲜海菜只能保存三天，因此，还设立水上活动工厂，作为水上基地，在海上及时加工处理收获船收获到的海菜。基地厂是一种吃水不深的大船，它可以在浅水上行驶，一昼夜可以接收和处理数百吨海菜。
    海带等海藻类植物在苏联获得了日益广泛的应用。这些海洋植物的产品不仅被利用来制作罐头、冰淇淋、果糕、面包、酒，而且还用来制作青霉素以及防水布。此外，纺织、制革、石油、畜牧和国民经济许多部门的生产中也要采用海藻类植物及其加工产品。（新华社）
