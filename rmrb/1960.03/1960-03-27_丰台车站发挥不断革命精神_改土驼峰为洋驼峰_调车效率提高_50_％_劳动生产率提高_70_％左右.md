Xinhua News Agency, March 26th – The workers of Beijing's Fengtai Station, who created China's first "indigenous hump yard," have recently transformed it into a "modern hump yard," increasing shunting efficiency by more than 50%, labor productivity by approximately 70%, and greatly improving working conditions.

Fengtai Station is a hub for the Beijing-Shanhaiguan, Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Baotou, and Fengtai-Shacheng railway lines. The shunting lines here resemble a spider web, with trains shuttling back and forth. During the Great Leap Forward, the station's workers, displaying a spirit of daring to think and daring to act, built three "indigenous hump yards" in five days, doubling the station's shunting capacity and initially meeting the needs of increased transport volume. However, this year's transport volume has increased significantly again. After investigation and research, the station's Party committee believes that only by rapidly transforming the "indigenous hump yard" and equipping it with mechanized and electrified equipment can they guarantee the needs of increased transport volume.

The transformation of the "indigenous hump yard" into a "modern hump yard" involves installing new technology and equipment such as televisions, intercom telephones, car retarders, automatic in-cab signals for locomotives, electric switches, and centralized electric switch control on the original foundation. In the past, on the "indigenous hump yard," when locomotives pushed dozens of cars over the hump, using the slope to allow the cars to roll separately onto various tracks, all operations besides the signals, such as braking and switch operation, were manual, placing a heavy physical burden on switch operators, shunters, and brakemen. Now, the switch operator only needs to sit in the control tower and lightly press a button to automatically move the switches on the track. Shunters can use the television screen to fully and accurately grasp the on-site conditions of locomotives and cars, their movements, the positions of parked cars, and the loading of goods. When a car rolls down the hump, the retarder automatically adjusts the car's speed to prevent collisions. Tests have proven that using the transformed hump yard to marshal and uncouple a train of thirty-four cars takes only five minutes, halving the original time.

The reconstruction of the "indigenous hump yard" at this station was carried out under the unified leadership of the Fengtai District Party Committee and the Fengtai Railway Area Party Committee, with the Fengtai Station, Fengtai Electrical Section, Fengtai Repair Factory, Beijing Railway Institute, Railway Science Research Institute, and five other units forming a "Hump Yard" Reconstruction Committee, involving more than forty units and two thousand people in the renovation. Factories and enterprises raced to take on the task of producing the more than two thousand castings and forgings required for the reconstruction of the "indigenous hump yard." Workers in various units dared to think and dared to act in the process of manufacturing equipment, overcoming numerous difficulties in technology, equipment, and materials. When designing the centralized control continuous control circuit, more than a hundred relays were needed, and these materials were difficult to find for a while. The Fengtai Electrical Section adopted a three-way combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to create a simple interlocking circuit method, eliminating duplicate circuits while ensuring safety, and only using a dozen or so relays. When workers at the Fengtai Repair Factory were making retarders, they lacked nodular cast iron. After collective research, they used high-grade cast iron instead and made the retarder. When processing large parts, they lacked large equipment. They adopted the method of "ants gnawing at bones" and a multi-machine assembly line operation to successfully complete more than nine hundred processing tasks. After seventeen days of hard work, they finally transformed the "indigenous hump yard" of the station's fourth shunting yard into a "modern hump yard" at high speed.

The transformation of the "indigenous hump yard" into a modern one, with low cost, high speed, and high efficiency, is a major innovation in China's railway transport work. The Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee attach great importance to it and have recently held an on-site meeting to promote this experience.

    丰台车站发挥不断革命精神
    改土驼峰为洋驼峰
    调车效率提高50％　劳动生产率提高70％左右
    新华社26日讯　创造我国第一个“土驼峰”调车场的北京丰台车站职工，最近又把“土驼峰”改变成“洋驼峰”，使调车作业效率提高50％以上，劳动生产率提高70％左右，而且大大改善了劳动条件。
    丰台车站是京山、京广、京包、丰沙等铁路干线的枢纽。这里的调车路线像蛛网一样，列车穿梭般地往来。这个车站职工在大跃进中发扬敢想敢干的风格，曾在五天内修建了三个“土驼峰”调车场，使车站的调车能力增加一倍，初步适应了运量增加的需要。但是，今年运量又有很大增长。车站党委经过调查研究，认为只有迅速地改造“土驼峰”，给它装备机械化、电气化的设备，才能保证运量增加的需要。
    “土驼峰”改造成“洋驼峰”，就是在原有的基础上，安装上电视机、对讲电话、车辆缓行器、机车车内自动信号、电动道岔和道岔的电气集中操纵等新技术装备。过去，在“土驼峰”调车场上，当机车顶着几十节车皮从驼峰上面利用坡度使车皮分别滑到各条股道上去的时候，除开信号机以外，车辆制动、道岔扳动等都是用手工操作的，扳道员、调车员和制动员的体力劳动很繁重。现在，扳道员只要坐在操纵楼内，轻便地按动电钮，线路上的道岔就会自动地移动；调车员只要通过电视机的萤光屏，就能全面、正确地掌握现场机车车辆状况、动态、停留车位置以及货物装载等情况。当车皮在驼峰上往下滑行时，缓行器就会自动调整车皮走行速度，防止车辆冲撞。试验证明，利用改造过的驼峰调车场编组、解体一列三十四节车皮的列车，只要五分钟就够了，比原来时间缩短了一半。
    这个车站改建“土驼峰”，是在中共丰台区委和丰台铁路地区党委统一领导下进行的，由丰台车站、丰台电务段、丰台修制厂、北京铁道学院、铁道科学研究院等八个单位组成了“土驼峰”改建委员会，参加革新的共有四十多个单位、两千多人。各个工厂企业抢着把改建“土驼峰”所需的两千多件铸件和锻件任务包下来。各单位职工在制造设备过程中敢想敢干，攻克了技术、设备、材料等方面的重重难关。在设计集中操纵的连续控制电路时，需要一百多个继电器，而这些材料一时很难找到；丰台电务段采取领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的办法，创造了简易连锁电路的方法，在保证安全的基础上，取消了重复电路，只用十多个继电器就够了。丰台修制厂职工在制作缓行器的时候，没有球墨铸铁，经过集体研究，利用高级铸铁代替，做成了缓行器。加工大部件时，缺少大设备，他们采取“蚂蚁啃骨头”和一机多用流水作业方法，顺利地完成了九百多件加工任务。经过十七天奋战，终于高速度地使车站第四调车场的“土驼峰”改变成了“洋驼峰”。
    “土驼峰”变洋，花钱少、速度快、效率高，是目前我国铁路运输工作中的一项具有重大意义的革新创举。铁道部和中共北京市委对它十分重视，最近已经召开现场会议推广这一经验。
