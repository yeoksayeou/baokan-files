Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 26th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" today published a commentary on the joint communiqué issued by the Chinese and Nepalese governments and the agreement signed between the two countries on border issues, saying, "This agreement reached by the Chinese and Nepalese governments has opened a new page in the development of friendly relations between the two countries, and it is also another important contribution to consolidating peace in Asia." The commentary said, "The agreement reached by the Chinese and Nepalese governments this time not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and Nepal, but also conforms to the interests of all peace-loving people in Asia. The Korean people express their warm welcome to this."

The commentary said that the agreement reached this time once again brilliantly demonstrates the peace-loving foreign policy consistently pursued by the Chinese government since its establishment. "In its relations with neighboring Nepal, the Chinese government has always respected its national independence, sincerely hoped for its prosperity and development, and provided sincere assistance. The fact that the Chinese government has decided to provide Nepal with huge grants of aid this time powerfully proves this point."

The commentary condemned the US imperialist conspiracy to provoke relations between China and other peace-loving Asian countries, and pointed out that the new development of Sino-Nepalese friendly cooperation once again dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, and more clearly exposed to the world the ugly nature of the "anti-China movement" manufactured by US imperialism. The commentary said that the people of Asia know clearly from historical experience that imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the people of Asia.

The commentary concluded, "The talks between the leaders of the Chinese and Nepalese governments and the great achievements made are another good example of resolving outstanding issues between friendly Asian countries in a way that is beneficial to both sides and in line with peace in Asia and the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 26th. The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" today published a commentary on the joint communiqué, the border issue agreement, and the economic assistance agreement signed between the Chinese and Nepalese governments, saying that the people of Asian countries regard the results of this Sino-Nepalese meeting as a positive contribution to the cause of consolidating Asian-African solidarity and safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

The commentary said that this new development in the relations between China, with a population of 650 million, and Nepal, with a population of 9 million, once again proves the abundant power of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the past month, China has signed documents full of mutual understanding and trust with Burma and Nepal, and Premier Zhou Enlai has also been invited to visit India on April 19. This is a victory for the peaceful will of millions of Asian and African people, and it is a fatal blow to imperialism, especially US imperialism, which is frantically alienating relations between Asian countries.

The commentary said that by recognizing their strength of unity and the lofty Five Principles, the people of Asia believe that the outstanding issues between some Asian countries can certainly be resolved well, just as the issues between China and Burma and Nepal have been resolved.

The "New Era" newspaper published a commentary today saying, "The agreement signed between China and Nepal is a major victory for the people of both countries and a major victory for the Bandung spirit."

The commentary refuted the slanderous arguments spread by US imperialism in order to alienate China's relations with Asian and African countries with the facts of the development of Sino-Nepalese friendly relations. The commentary said that the facts eloquently show that the stronger China is, the more secure its neighboring countries are, the more consolidated Asian peace is, and the more developed the relations of mutual assistance and cooperation are.

The "Xin Yuehua Bao" published an editorial saying that the conclusion of the agreement on the border issue between the two countries and the economic assistance agreement between the two countries gave another powerful blow to the international reactionaries headed by US imperialism. The editorial pointed out that the imperialists' conspiracy to encourage anti-China and anti-Chinese movements and alienate the friendly relations between China and its neighbors is being seen through by more and more people. The people of Asian and African countries, who have long fought against imperialism and for national independence, can not only distinguish between friends and enemies, but also know how to unite to deal with common enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, March 26th. Tokyo News: Mishima Ichi, Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association and Standing Director of the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, issued a statement today, welcoming the signing of the two agreements on border issues and economic assistance between China and Nepal and the joint communiqué of the Chinese and Nepalese governments. He pointed out that this will make a great contribution to the cause of peace in Asia.

Mishima emphasized that this is a concrete application and development of the Bandung spirit, and at the same time a concrete manifestation of China's consistent peaceful policy.

He said that the signing of the Sino-Nepalese border agreement will have a good impact on resolving the border issue between China and India. Mishima pointed out the importance of the fact that the Sino-Nepalese economic assistance agreement is not attached to any conditions or privileges. He said that this agreement sets an example of selfless assistance.

The "Akahata" newspaper published an article today saying that the agreement and communiqué signed by the Chinese and Nepalese governments are full of the spirit of mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit. If all countries adopt this attitude, it is certain that there will be no issues between Asian and African countries that cannot be resolved through consultation.

    和平共处原则的又一次胜利
    朝、越、日舆论指出中尼协定是对亚洲和平的贡献
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天就中国和尼泊尔两国政府发表的联合公报和两国签订的关于边界问题的协定发表评论说，“这次中尼两国政府取得的协议为发展两国间的友好关系揭开了新的一页，同时这也是对巩固亚洲和平作出的又一个重要贡献。”评论说，“中尼两国政府这次达成的协议不仅符合中尼两国人民的利益，而且也符合亚洲一切爱好和平人民的利益。朝鲜人民对此表示热烈的欢迎。”
    评论说，这次达成的协议又一次辉煌地显示了中国政府从它成立以来一贯奉行的爱好和平的外交政策。“中国政府在同邻近的尼泊尔的关系中，一贯尊重它的民族独立，真心希望它繁荣发展，并给予了诚意的帮助。中国政府这次又决定给尼泊尔以巨大的无偿援助，这一事实有力地证明了这一点。”
    评论谴责了美帝国主义挑拨中国和其它亚洲爱好和平国家之间关系的阴谋，并且指出，中尼友好合作关系的新发展，又一次给予了帝国主义以沉重的打击，更加清楚地向全世界揭露了美帝国主义制造的“反华运动”的丑恶本质。评论说，亚洲人民从历史经验中清楚地知道，帝国主义才是亚洲人民不共戴天的死敌。
    评论最后指出，“这次中尼两国政府领导人间的会谈和所取得的巨大成就，是解决亚洲友好国家间悬而未决的问题，使之有利于双方并符合亚洲和世界和平的又一个很好的榜样。”
    新华社河内26日电　越南“人民报”今天就中国同尼泊尔两国政府签订的联合公报、边界问题协定和经济援助协定发表评论说，亚洲各国人民把这次中尼会谈的成果视为对巩固亚非团结的事业、维护亚洲和全世界和平事业的一种积极贡献。
    评论说，拥有六亿五千万人口的中国同拥有九百万人口的尼泊尔在关系上的这个新的进展，再一次证明了和平共处五项原则的充沛力量。近一个月来，中国同缅甸和尼泊尔之间签订了充满着互相谅解和信赖精神的文件，周恩来总理还应邀在4月19日访问印度。这是千百万亚非人民的和平意志的胜利，这是给予帝国主义、首先是正在疯狂地离间亚洲各国之间的关系的美帝国主义的致命打击。
    评论说，由于认识到自己的团结力量和崇高的五项原则，亚洲人民相信，亚洲某些国家之间的悬而未决的问题，一定能够像解决中国和缅甸和尼泊尔之间的问题一样获得良好解决。
    “新时代”报今天发表评论说，“中国和尼泊尔签定的协定，是两国人民的重大胜利，是万隆精神的重大胜利。”
    评论以中尼友好关系发展的事实驳斥了美帝国主义为了离间中国同亚非国家的关系而散布的诬蔑中国的论调。评论说，事实雄辩地说明，中国越强大，它的各个邻国的安全就越有保障，亚洲和平就更加巩固，彼此互助合作的关系就更加发展。
    “新越华报”发表社论说，中尼两国缔结有关两国边界问题协定和两国经济援助协定给了以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派又一次有力的痛击。社论指出，帝国主义者鼓励反华排华运动、离间中国同它的邻邦的友好关系的阴谋，正被越来越多的人所识破。曾长期为反对帝国主义、争取民族独立而斗争的亚非各国人民，不仅能够分清敌友，而且懂得如何团结一致对付共同的敌人。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会副会长、日本亚非团结委员会常任理事三岛一今天发表谈话，表示欢迎中国和尼泊尔两国签订有关边界问题和经济援助两项协定以及中尼两国政府的联合公报。他指出，这将对亚洲和平事业作出巨大贡献。
    三岛强调指出，这是万隆精神的具体运用和发展，同时是中国一贯执行的和平政策的具体表现。
    他说，中尼两国边界问题协定的签订，将给解决中国和印度两国边界问题带来良好影响。三岛指出了中尼两国经济援助协定没有附带任何条件和特权这一点的重要意义。他说，这项协定树立了无私援助的榜样。
    “赤旗报”今天发表文章说，中尼两国政府签订的协定和公报充满着相互信任和平等互利的精神。如果所有的国家都采取这种态度，可以确信在亚非各国相互间不会存在用协商方式不能解决的问题。
