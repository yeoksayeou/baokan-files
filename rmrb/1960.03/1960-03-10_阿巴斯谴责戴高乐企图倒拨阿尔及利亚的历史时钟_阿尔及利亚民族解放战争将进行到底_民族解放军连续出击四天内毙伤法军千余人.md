Xinhua News Agency, March 9th, Karachi dispatch: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Premier Abbas stated in Tunis on the 6th that the Algerian National Liberation Army would continue its war for independence until there was a real hope for a peaceful and just resolution of the Algerian question.

Abbas's statement was made to a special correspondent of the Pakistani "Dawn" newspaper stationed in Tunis, who visited him. The newspaper published it on the 7th.

Abbas said the Algerian war could last for many years. He said the whole world should understand that "before we have considerable confidence in holding free elections in Algeria," the Algerian National Liberation Army is unwilling to accept a ceasefire. He said, "Our previous experience with Algerian elections was painful because the French army openly interfered and oppressed us. We cannot participate in similar distortions of democracy in the future."

Abbas condemned De Gaulle's speech to officers of the French colonial army in Constantine, Algeria, on March 3 as "an attempt to turn back the clock in Algeria." He believes that "De Gaulle's speech negates his declaration of September 16 last year, which expressed his willingness to allow Algerians to enjoy the right to decide their own future."

Premier Abbas pointed out that "not only that, but it is also a declaration of total war against the Algerian people." He said that De Gaulle's speech "leaves us no choice but to continue our war for independence."

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Cairo dispatch: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Saad Dahlab, said when he met with reporters in Cairo on the 7th that French President De Gaulle's recent speech to officers of the French colonial army in Algeria revealed De Gaulle's own mask.

In these speeches, De Gaulle emphasized continuing the colonial war and that "France must remain in Algeria."

Dahlab said that when the Algerian Republic Provisional Government agreed to the principle of self-determination, it expressed its hope to end the Algerian war through a peaceful solution. He said that since De Gaulle reiterated that the Algerian National Liberation Army must be destroyed, he affirmed that the war would continue.

Dahlab pointed out that De Gaulle should be held responsible for the continuation of the Algerian war, and the whole world is a witness to this fact.

Dahlab emphasized, "The battle will continue. The Algerian army will not end the war until it achieves our ultimate goal—independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 8th: The Supreme Command of the Algerian National Liberation Army issued a military communique today stating that in the first four days of March, the Algerian National Liberation Army attacked thirty French army strongholds, engaged in twenty-two battles with the French army, and ambushed French army convoys in thirty locations. Commandos of the Algerian National Liberation Army successfully attacked the enemy in seventy-one urban and rural areas.

The communique said that during this period, the Algerian National Liberation Army killed 761 French soldiers, wounded 443, and another 28 enemy soldiers surrendered to the Algerian National Liberation Army with their weapons.

The communique also said that Algerian nationalists destroyed 85 enemy military vehicles, shot down two French military aircraft, destroyed two military trains, and seized 524 French weapons in combat.

    阿巴斯谴责戴高乐企图倒拨阿尔及利亚的历史时钟
    阿尔及利亚民族解放战争将进行到底
    民族解放军连续出击四天内毙伤法军千余人
    新华社9日讯　卡拉奇消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯6日在突尼斯发表谈话说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军将继续进行争取独立的战争，直到真正有希望和平地和正义地解决阿尔及利亚问题的时候为止。
    阿巴斯这篇谈话是向访问他的巴基斯坦“黎明报”驻突尼斯城特派记者说的，这家报纸已在7日予以发表。
    阿巴斯说，阿尔及利亚战争可能持续许多年。他说，全世界应该了解，“在我们对于在阿尔及利亚进行自由选举有相当把握以前”，阿尔及利亚民族解放军是不愿接受停火的。他说，“以前的阿尔及利亚选举给我们的经验是痛苦的，因为法军公开进行干涉和压迫，我们今后不能参与类似的歪曲民主的做法”。
    阿巴斯谴责戴高乐3月3日在阿尔及利亚的君士坦丁对法国殖民军队的军官发表的讲话是“企图在阿尔及利亚倒拨时钟”。他认为“戴高乐的讲话否定了他去年9月16日表示愿让阿尔及利亚人享有决定自己未来的权利的那项宣言”。
    阿巴斯总理指出，“不仅如此，这还是对阿尔及利亚人宣布总体战”。他说，戴高乐的这次讲话“使我们没有选择的余地，只有继续我们争取独立的战争”。
    新华社8日讯　开罗消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府外交部秘书长沙阿德·达列伯7日在开罗接见记者时说，法国总统戴高乐最近在阿尔及利亚对法国殖民军队的军官发表的演说，揭开了戴高乐自己的假面具。
    戴高乐在这些演说中强调，继续殖民战争和“法国必须留在阿尔及利亚”。
    达列伯说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在同意自决原则的时候就表示它希望通过和平的解决办法来结束阿尔及利亚战争。他说，戴高乐既然重申必须摧毁阿尔及利亚民族解放军，他就肯定了战争将继续下去。
    达列伯指出，戴高乐应对阿尔及利亚战争的延续负责，全世界都是这一事实的见证人。
    达列伯强调说，“战斗将继续下去。阿尔及利亚军队在实现我们最后的目标——独立以前，将不结束战争。”
    新华社开罗8日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放军最高司令部今天发表的一项军事公报说，在3月头四天中，阿尔及利亚民族解放军袭击了法军三十个据点，同法军进行了二十二次战斗，并且在三十个地方对法军的运输队进行伏击。阿尔及利亚民族解放军的突击队在七十一个城乡成功地袭击了敌人。
    公报说，在这期间，阿尔及利亚民族解放军共击毙法军七百六十一人，击伤四百四十三人，另有二十八名敌军携带武器向阿尔及利亚民族解放军投诚。
    公报又说，阿尔及利亚民族主义者在战斗中摧毁敌军八十五辆军用车辆，击落法军两架军用飞机，炸毁两列军用列车，并缴获法军五百二十四件武器。
