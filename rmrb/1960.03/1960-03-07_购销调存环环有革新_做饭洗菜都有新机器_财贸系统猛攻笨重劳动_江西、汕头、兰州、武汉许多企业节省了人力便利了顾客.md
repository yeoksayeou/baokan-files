Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang — Employees in Jiangxi Province's commercial departments, focusing on supporting production and better serving consumers, have launched a technical innovation movement centered on semi-mechanization and mechanization around purchasing and sales. From last winter to now, the province's commercial system has implemented more than 7,800 technical innovation projects, totaling over 96,000 items, averaging one innovation per two commercial employees.

The main characteristic of the technical innovation movement in Jiangxi's commercial departments is its concentration on tackling the links with heavy manual labor and more manual operations in purchasing, processing, storage and transportation, service, and retail. It widely adopts simple tools and a combination of indigenous and foreign-made machines to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization. Currently, a full set of innovative tools is being promoted in the grading, weighing, settlement, loading, and unloading stages of agricultural and sideline product purchasing. The automatic pricing scale and calculation disk created by commercial employees in Jinxi County can simultaneously determine the weight and price when purchasing live pigs, poultry, and other agricultural and sideline products, which saves pricing time and avoids errors.

Warehouse storage and transportation is a link in commodity circulation with the most heavy manual labor. Employees of the Jiangxi Provincial Commercial Department's storage and transportation station, after more than 40 days of hard work, created and imitated various elevators, swivel cranes, hand-cranked delivery chutes, native railways, universal cargo vehicles, baling machines, and more than 600 other mechanized and semi-mechanized tools, basically realizing rail-based warehouse handling and semi-mechanized lifting. With the continuous increase in storage tasks, the number of employees at the station has been reduced by about half.

Technical innovation in the urban catering service industry and retail commerce has started even earlier and faster. In Nanchang City's catering industry, machines are used for cutting vegetables, washing vegetables, washing rice, disinfecting, kneading dough, grinding pulp, using water, and transporting items, freeing many workers from heavy manual labor. Employees of retail stores throughout the province have created many simple sales tools, such as change calculators, electric shoe fitting devices, sock fitting devices, clothing fitting devices, liquid dispensers, coin sorters, etc., which have greatly improved sales efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou — In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, commercial departments in Shantou City, Guangdong Province, have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in the links with a high proportion of manual operation and heavy manual labor, and then promoted it comprehensively, achieving "breakthroughs in key areas and blooming in all directions." Now the technical innovation movement has spread to all links and departments of commodity purchasing, sales, distribution, storage, processing, and catering services. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce held an on-site meeting here to promote the city's experience.

In the past year, employees in Shantou City's commercial departments created and imitated 227 kinds of new tools, totaling 5,280 pieces, and promoted 144 advanced operating techniques. In January of this year, they created another 752 new tools, and three automatic production lines, such as flour processing and briquette processing plants, have emerged. As a result of technical innovation, labor efficiency and service quality have been significantly improved, and labor intensity and cost levels have been greatly reduced. The Shantou Department Store uses a large number of self-created new tools for measuring, pricing, inventory, checking product quality, and packaging. Although the monthly turnover has doubled compared with the past, the number of personnel has been reduced from 167 to 61. The city's slaughtering, vegetable, flour, waste product, and briquette processing plants have achieved mechanization. After a large number of innovative tools have been implemented in catering services, warehouse storage and transportation, many complicated operations have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou — Many units in Lanzhou City's commercial, grain, and service industries have tried every possible means to innovate tools, improve work efficiency, and improve service quality.

Employees of the Yuebinlou Restaurant created electric vegetable delivery machines, signal ordering machines, and machines for cutting vegetables, washing vegetables, mixing fillings, and kneading dough, and used boiler steam to steam buns. The efficiency of these machines is three to twenty times higher than manual operations.

Many stores and supply stations have installed fast sales counters and automatic change dispensers and other advanced sales tools, realizing mobile counters, fast pricing, and "mechanical handling." Sales efficiency has increased by one to two or three times compared to the past. Wang Changhui, Lu Shipei, and other employees of the Yongchang Road Department Store created a turntable display rack that places daily necessities on the turntable, which can automatically rotate back and forth, allowing customers to select goods, and it is also very convenient for salespeople to pick up goods. According to their measurements, customers can save two-thirds to one-half of the time shopping for goods on the turntable display rack compared to shopping at a regular counter.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan — A number of units with good technical innovation achievements have emerged in various industries in Wuhan City's financial and trade system.

Most of the warehouses of the Wuhan City Storage and Transportation Company are four-story buildings. Goods enter and exit frequently, and they all rely on manual carrying, which results in high labor intensity, and warehouse utilization is also affected. The company's party organization mobilized the masses to create electric elevators, electric cable cars, etc., so that the handling of goods up and down the building, stacking, and flat ground transportation are basically carried out using machinery and vehicles, changing the original situation. The Laotongcheng Restaurant, famous for its three-delicacy bean curd sheets, has seen its daily customers increase from 4,000 before 1958 to the current 7,000 to 8,000. Business is very busy. One person can't even keep up with grinding bean curd pulp all day long, and the twelve stoves for steaming rice and steaming dumplings are often sold out, and six people boiling water can't meet the demand, resulting in many customer complaints. The restaurant's party branch led employees to find a way out from technical innovation, manufacturing electric grinders, electric mortars, steam boilers, food delivery elevators, rice washing machines, vegetable cutting machines, etc. As a result, the labor of the culinary staff has been greatly eased, and the service staff no longer have to carry dozens of kilograms of trays up and down the stairs. Both service efficiency and quality have been improved. Bank employees have also created interest calculators, combined coin counting and packaging machines, electric stamping machines, etc., reducing manual labor and improving work efficiency.

    购销调存环环有革新  做饭洗菜都有新机器
    财贸系统猛攻笨重劳动
    江西、汕头、兰州、武汉许多企业节省了人力便利了顾客
    据新华社南昌讯　江西省商业部门职工，围绕购销业务，从支持生产、更好地为消费者服务出发，开展以半机械化和机械化为中心的技术革新运动。从去年冬季到现在，全省商业系统已经实现了技术革新项目七千八百多项、九万六千多件，平均每二名商业职工就有一件革新。
    江西商业部门技术革新运动的主要特点，是集中力量围攻采购、加工、储运、服务、零售等笨重体力劳动和手工操作较多的环节，广泛采用简易工具和土洋结合的机器，实现半机械化和机械化。现在，农副产品收购工作中的验级、过秤、结算、装卸等环节，都在推广全套的革新工具。金溪县商业职工创造的自动计价台秤和计算盘，在收购生猪、家禽和其他农副产品时，可以同时得知重量和价格，既节省计价时间，又能避免差错。
    仓储调运是商品流通中笨重体力劳动最多的一个环节。江西省商业厅储运站职工，苦战了四十多天，创制和仿造了各式升降机、转向起重机、手摇送货滑梯、土轨道、万能运货车、打捆机等六百多件机械化和半机械化工具，基本上实现了仓库搬运轨道车子化、上下起重半机械化。在仓储任务不断增加的情况下，全站的职工人数还减少了一半左右。
    城镇饮食服务行业和零售商业的技术革新开展得更早更快。南昌市饮食行业在切菜、洗菜、淘米、消毒、和面、磨浆、用水、传送等方面，都使用了机器，使许多工人解除了笨重的体力劳动。全省零售商店的职工制出许多种简易售货工具，如找款计算器、电动试鞋器、试袜器、试衣器、液体售货器、硬币分类器等，对提高售货效率起了很大作用。
    据新华社广州电　广东汕头市商业部门在技术革新和技术革命运动中，针对手工操作和笨重体力劳动比重大的环节实现机械化半机械化，然后推动全面，作到“重点突破，四面开花”。现在技术革新运动，已经遍及商品的购、销、调、存和加工、饮食服务等各个环节和部门。最近，广东省商业厅在这里召开现场会议，推广这个市的经验。
    汕头市商业部门职工在去年一年中，创造和仿制新工具二百二十七种共五千二百八十件，推广先进操作技术一百四十四项。今年1月份，又创制新工具七百五十二件，并出现了面粉加工、煤球加工厂等三条自动作业线。革新技术的结果，劳动效率和服务质量显著提高，劳动强度和费用水平大大降低。汕头市百货大楼大量使用自己创制的计量、计价、盘点、检查商品质量和包装等新工具后，每月营业额虽然比过去提高二倍，但是人员却由一百六十七人减少为六十一人。全市屠宰、蔬菜、面粉、废品、煤球等加工厂实现了机械化，饮食服务业、仓贮运输等环节大量革新工具后，有许多繁杂操作实现了机械化、半机械化。
    据新华社兰州电　兰州市商业、粮食、服务行业许多单位，千方百计革新工具，提高了工作效率和服务质量。
  悦宾楼菜馆的职工创造了电动送菜机、讯号要菜机和切菜、洗菜、拌馅、和面等机械，并用锅炉蒸汽蒸馍，工效分别比手工操作提高三倍至二十倍。
    许多商店和供应站安装了快速售货台和自动找零器等先进售货工具，实现了活动柜台、快速计价、“机械搬运”，售货效率比过去提高了一倍至二、三倍不等。永昌路百货商店职工王常辉、陆施培等创造的转盘售货架，把日用百货安放在转盘上，转盘能够自动转来转去，让顾客挑选货物，售货员取货也非常方便。据他们测算，顾客在转盘售货架选购货物，可以比在一般货柜购货节省三分之二到一半的时间。
    据新华社武汉电　武汉市财贸系统各行各业出现了一批技术革新成绩较好的单位。
    武汉市仓储公司的仓库多数都是四层楼的建筑，商品进出频繁，全靠人力扛抬，劳动强度大，仓库利用也受到影响。公司党组织便发动群众创造了电动升降机、电动缆车等，使货物上下楼、堆垛、平地运输都基本上使用机械和车子，改变了原来的状况。以供应三鲜豆皮著名的老通成餐馆，每天的顾客由1958年前的四千人次增长到目前的七、八千人次，营业很忙，一个人一天到晚专磨豆皮浆还跟不上，十二个炉灶蒸饭、蒸包饺还经常脱销，六个人烧水也供不应求，顾客意见很多。餐馆党支部领导职工从技术革新方面找出路，制造了电磨、电臼、蒸气锅炉、送饭菜升降机、洗米机、切菜机等，炊事人员的劳动因此轻松多了，服务人员也不再托着几十斤重的条盘楼上楼下奔跑，服务效率和质量都有提高。银行职工也创造了利息计算器、硬分币点数包装联合器、电动盖戳机等，减少了手工劳动，提高了工作效率。
