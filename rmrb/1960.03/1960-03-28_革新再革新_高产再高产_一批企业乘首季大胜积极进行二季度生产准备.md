    Stone Steel
    Establish High Standards, Win the First Quarter, Seize the Next Step Early, Strive for the Top Again
   According to Xinhua News Agency, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, which proposed to iron and steel enterprises across the country to complete the first quarter's steel production plan ahead of schedule, has fully realized the proposed conditions ahead of schedule. The output of steel, pig iron, and steel products has completed the first quarter's production plan twenty-seven, eight, and nine days ahead of schedule, respectively, which is three, three, and seven days ahead of the proposed conditions, respectively. Now, the workers are striving to increase production while actively preparing, and strive to win a greater harvest in steel production in the second quarter.
    After the company proposed to iron and steel enterprises across the country to complete the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule, the workers were even more motivated. They posted their guarantee letters and the challenge letters from iron and steel enterprises across the country next to the furnace, compared them with their own production results, and promptly exchanged production information with major iron and steel enterprises, learned the advanced experience of fraternal enterprises, and used high standards to demand themselves. Therefore, the production upsurge was higher than the previous one, and the entire company showed an unprecedented good situation, and the production level reached a new peak.
    On the premise of putting politics in command, strengthening the centralized leadership of the Party, and carrying out mass movements, further deepening the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in combination with mass technical analysis is one of the important experiences of this company's substantial increase in production. In the past month, the company has implemented a total of 895 innovation projects, realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization of 243 heavy physical labor and manual operations, which not only improved production, but also saved more than 900 laborers, freeing 1,359 people from heavy physical labor and manual operations.
    Based on their experience of "taking the first step and looking at the second step" in the Great Leap Forward, the company has already studied the various production tasks for the second quarter. The company's employees have deeply discussed the production plan for the second quarter, and the production teams and groups have formulated guarantee conditions. The workers are working hard to improve their technical operation level in technical performance competitions, and are carrying out a larger-scale mass movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation to meet the greater steel production upsurge in the second quarter.
    Daye Steel Plant
    Grasp the Key, Establish a Command Center
    Set out in Several Ways to Prepare Raw Materials
    According to Xinhua News Agency Wuhan Electric, the Daye Steel Plant, which has completed the first quarter's steel production plan ahead of schedule, is organizing overproduction on the one hand, and concentrating its efforts on the preparation for the second quarter's production on the other hand.
    Grasping current production with one hand and the preparation for the next step of production with the other is an important reason for Daye Steel Plant's continuous leap forward in production this year. In December last year, after the factory completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule, the Party committee immediately formed two teams, one to organize overproduction and the other to concentrate efforts to prepare for the first quarter's production this year. As a result, it guaranteed a good start for production at the beginning of this year and monthly red banners in the first quarter, completing the first quarter's steel production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule. Now they continue to use this experience, and after completing the first quarter's steel production plan ahead of schedule, they quickly issued the production plan for the first month of the second quarter, organized workers to discuss it, and actively carried out various production preparations according to the determined plan.
    Daye Steel Plant's production task for the second quarter is a huge increase compared to the first quarter. In order to ensure the completion of this plan, the factory established a open hearth furnace renovation command headquarters headed by the factory director to focus on the open hearth furnace renovation work. At present, the metal structure and refractory bricks for the renovation of No. 2 open hearth furnace are ready, and it is planned to renovate it in April; No. 3 and No. 4 open hearth furnaces will also be renovated in the second quarter, and the daily output of the open hearth furnace will rapidly increase.
    In terms of high-quality steel production, the main focus is on processing. They are increasing grinding wheels, air shovels, and air compressors for finishing steel, while equipping personnel for the back-end auxiliary processes; at the same time, they have increased the number of rolling mills and are installing core-pulling machines for producing hollow steel and complete sets of equipment for producing angle steel and flat steel, so as to produce large quantities of angle steel, flat steel, and hollow steel.
    In terms of raw material preparation, they are currently engaged in large-scale coke ovens to solve the factory's coke supply problem. An oxygen station is being built at an accelerated pace, striving to put it into production in April. The factory has sent personnel to relevant regions to purchase and transfer coke and bituminous coal. In addition, they are trying every means to use substitutes and save raw materials. At present, the factory produces 100 to 150 tons of dolomite per day, and calcined dolomite can replace magnesite for steelmaking. The gas workshop has also successfully used local firewood mixed with bituminous coal to produce cold gas, which has found a new way to solve the bituminous coal problem. Kailuan Coal Mine's 60,000 Employees Achieve Outstanding Results in Innovation, Many Suggestions Adopted, New Look
According to Xinhua News Agency Tianjin Electric, Kailuan Coal Mine's 60,000 employees are making great efforts in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which has promoted a comprehensive leap forward in production. As of the 24th, the mine had overfulfilled the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule by seven days. Compared with the fourth quarter of last year, the various quarterly indicators that have been completed: the average daily output of raw coal increased by 2.8%, the daily footage of tunneling increased by 7.9%, labor productivity increased by 6.4%, timber consumption decreased by 5.81%, the unit cost of raw coal decreased by 8%, and the quality meets the requirements.
    The comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production at Kailuan Coal Mine is the result of the large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization movement carried out by the vast number of employees. In just over two months, the employees put forward more than 46,000 innovation suggestions and implemented 26,000 of them, thereby changing the face of coal mine production.
    While making great efforts in mechanization and semi-mechanization, the employees are also attacking new technologies and vigorously developing automation, semi-automation, and hydraulic technology. Hydraulic coal mining has made great progress in the first quarter of this year, and the output of hydraulic coal mining in the mine has accounted for 20.65% of the total output.
    In order to ensure a sustained leap forward in production, the mine has also manufactured and promoted a large number of substitute mine timbers, which have been widely used in underground roadways and working faces. (Attached photo)

    革新再革新　高产再高产
    一批企业乘首季大胜积极进行二季度生产准备
    石钢
    树立高标准首季获胜  早抓下一步再争上游
   据新华社讯　向全国钢铁企业倡议提前完成首季钢铁生产计划的石景山钢铁公司，已经提前全面实现了倡议条件，钢、生铁和钢材的产量，分别提前二十七天、八天和九天完成了首季生产计划，比倡议提出的条件分别提前了三天、三天和七天。现在，职工们正在一面努力超产，一面积极做好准备，力争在第二季度夺取钢铁生产的更大丰收。
    这个公司在向全国钢铁企业提出提前完成首季生产计划的倡议以后，职工们干劲更足，他们把自己的保证书和各地钢铁企业的应战书贴在炉旁，跟自己的生产成绩进行比较，并且及时和各大钢铁企业交流生产情况，学习兄弟企业的先进经验，用高标准要求自己。因此，生产热潮一浪高过一浪，整个公司出现了空前的大好形势，生产水平达到了新的高峰。
    在政治挂帅，加强党的集中领导和大搞群众运动的前提下，把进一步深入开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动同群众性的技术分析结合起来，是这个公司生产大幅度上升的重要经验之一。最近一个月以来，全公司共实现了八百九十五项革新项目，使二百四十三项笨重体力劳动和手工操作实现了机械化、半机械化，不仅提高了生产，而且节约出劳动力九百多人，使一千三百五十九人从笨重体力劳动和手工操作中解放出来。
    这个公司根据他们在大跃进中“走第一步，看第二步”的经验，已经及早研究了第二季度的各项生产工作，这个公司的职工已经深入讨论了第二季度生产计划，各生产班、组纷纷制定了保证条件，工人们正在技术表演赛中，努力提高技术操作水平，开展更大规模的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的群众运动，来迎接第二季度更大的钢铁生产高潮。
    大冶钢厂
    抓住关键成立指挥部
    几路出动准备原材料
    据新华社武汉电　已经提前完成第一季度钢铁生产计划的大冶钢厂，正在一面组织超额生产，一面集中力量抓第二季度生产准备工作。
    一手抓当前生产，一手抓下一步的生产准备，是大冶钢厂今年生产持续跃进的重要原因。去年12月份，这个工厂提前完成年度生产计划以后，党委立即组成两个班子，一面组织超产，一面集中力量为今年第一季度的生产进行各项准备。结果，保证了今年年初生产开门红和第一季度月月红，提前十五天完成了第一季度的钢铁生产计划。现在他们又继续运用这条经验，在提前完成第一季度钢铁生产计划以后，迅速下达第二季度头一个月的生产计划，组织工人讨论，并根据确定的计划，积极进行各项生产准备工作。
    大冶钢厂第二季度的生产任务比第一季度有巨大增长。为保证完成这一计划，这个工厂成立了以厂长为首的平炉改装指挥部，大抓平炉改装工作。现在，二号平炉改装用的金属结构和耐火砖等已经准备就绪，计划在4月份改装好；三、四号平炉也将在第二季度分别改装好，平炉的日产量将迅速提高。
    在优质钢材生产方面，主要是抓加工。他们正在一面增加精整钢材用的砂轮、风铲和压缩空气机，一面配备后辅工序的人员；同时增加了轧辊，正在装生产中空钢的抽心机和生产角钢、扁钢的全套设备，以便大量生产角钢、扁钢和中空钢。
    在原料材料准备方面，目前正在大搞炼焦炉，解决全厂焦炭供应问题。一座氧气站正在加紧兴建，力争4月份投入生产。厂里已派出人员分赴有关地区采购、调运焦炭和烟煤。另外，还千方百计地采用代用品和节约原料、材料。现在全厂日产白云石一百到一百五十吨，用熟白云石可以代替炼钢用镁砂。煤气车间利用本地柴煤掺合烟煤生产冷煤气也获得成功，为解决烟煤问题找到了新的途径。开滦煤矿六万职工搞革新成绩出色大量建议被采纳面貌一新据新华社天津电　开滦煤矿六万职工大闹技术革新和技术革命运动，推动了生产全面跃进。到24日止，全矿已提前七天超额完成了第一季度生产计划。已完成的各项季度指标同去年第四季度比较：原煤平均日产量提高2．8％，掘进日进尺提高7．9％，劳动生产率提高6．4％，坑木消耗降低5．81％，原煤单位成本降低8％，质量合乎要求。
    开滦煤矿生产实现全面持续跃进，是广大职工大搞机械化半机械化运动的结果。在短短的两个多月之内，职工们提出了四万六千多条革新建议，实现了二万六千条，从而改变了煤矿生产面貌。
    在大闹机械化和半机械化的同时，职工们还猛攻新技术和大搞自动化、半自动化、水力化。水力采煤在今年第一季度内有很大发展，全矿水力采煤的产量已占总产量的20．65％。
