    Adding Wings to a Steed
    Ten Years of Gou Wenbin, Deputy Director of Chongqing Enamel Factory, Advancing Towards Culture and Science
    By Our Correspondent Li Xiangtao

    In the center of the Chongqing Enamel Factory dormitory, there is a small room. Here, whether it is the bitter winter or the scorching summer, a bright light always shines when the night is quiet. When night shift workers see it, they always praise, "Deputy Director Gou is studying again!"
    Deputy Director Gou Wenbin has been persistently and tirelessly adhering to amateur self-study for ten full years. Ten years ago, he was an apprentice who had not graduated from elementary school and could not even write a letter. Now, he has advanced to university-level professional courses, self-studied Russian, German, French, and Polish, and can translate German and Russian technical books related to enamel industry formulas. Last year, he and veteran workers co-authored a "Principle of Enamel Glaze Design" and attended the National Congress of Heroes. Since the beginning of this year, he has continuously designed some new enamel glaze formulas, solved some key problems in China's enamel industry production, and has been hired as a director of the National Silicate Chemical Society.
    When Gou Wenbin first arrived at the Enamel Factory in the spring of 1950, he was a fourteen or fifteen-year-old apprentice. He didn't talk much to people and always took on the heavy work. In 1953, he joined the Party, and in 1955, he reached the level of a sixth-grade technician. He loved to learn technology and culture. He always carried a notebook in his pocket and studied in his spare time, asking people whenever he encountered difficulties. Some people jokingly praised him, saying, "Little Gou is becoming an intellectual." He replied seriously, "Our factory will be mechanized in the future. How can we do without culture!"
    In 1955, Gou Wenbin became the chairman of the trade union and the deputy head of the technology section. Once, he led visiting guests on a tour of the laboratory. The visitors asked him questions as they watched, but he stared at the complex instruments and couldn't answer a single one. Someone mocked him behind his back, "Country bumpkin." He didn't say a word, but thought to himself: Our working class is in power, and we must lead science! If we don't know, we must learn. No one is born knowing science! From then on, he secretly resolved to work harder to learn culture and science. Just then, that summer, a porcelain cracking accident occurred in the factory, and production would have to stop if it wasn't resolved. Gou Wenbin was so anxious that he didn't sleep for days, running to the workshop and then to the office, but he couldn't find the problem. At this time, an engineer from the Industrial Bureau came and said after looking at it, "The expansion coefficient is too different," and successfully solved the accident with reference to Soviet experience. That afternoon, Gou Wenbin stood in the workshop for a long time, looking at the good and bright mouth cups produced after adjusting the expansion coefficient. He ran back to the dormitory and immediately wrote a big-character poster, which he posted on the wall: "Gou Wenbin, Gou Wenbin, if you want to work well, you must study well!" He was thus determined to break into the gate of culture and science in the short term.
    Gou Wenbin is the busiest person in the factory, managing production and life. The only time he has to study is in the morning and evening. Every day, he gets up before dawn, and in the evening, he studies at his desk, regardless of fatigue. He does this every day. In this way, he can study at least twenty-five hours a week. He has to put in a lot of hard work to take each step forward. At first, element symbols, molecular formulas, C angles, B angles, theorems, laws..., he often remembered this but forgot that, and sometimes he became more and more confused, with his mind like a tangled mess. He read it over and over again, but still couldn't remember many things. More than seven months passed, and the harvest was small. Looking at the books on the table, he thought, "It's really difficult for a roughneck to learn this stuff!"
    One afternoon, he was about to go out to play when Zhu Yuan, a member of the Party General Branch and director of the factory, came to see him and asked, "Little Gou, how is your study going?" Gou Wenbin replied with a blush, "I stopped studying a long time ago." Director Zhu looked at him sternly, encouraged him not to be afraid of difficulties and to persevere, telling him, "Our working class wants to change the world, can we do without culture? You are a Party member, you are studying for the Party!" The Party General Branch also found some comrades to help him study. Under the encouragement of the Party, Gou Wenbin continued to work hard and study tenaciously. He knew that the road to learning was not smooth, and whenever he encountered a difficult chapter, he would not easily ask people, but would always think about it over and over again, and would not let go until he understood it.
    Gou Wenbin was born into a poor peasant family in Ba County, Sichuan. His father died when he was young, and at the age of eleven, he left elementary school without finishing it. He endured hunger and cold, making a living by selling firewood and grass. From an early age, he developed a tenacious and hard-working spirit, which he now applies to his work and study.
    Under the leadership of the Party branch and with the help of some comrades, Gou Wenbin improved his study methods. He made a study plan, stipulated study time, and exercised during his studies. Gradually, his health improved, and his study progress became faster. He also looked for tricks to study. Once, he saw in a book on memory problems that "the more times something appears in the mind, the more profound the impression," so in his studies, he wrote the formulas, theorems, laws, and element symbols that should be remembered on small pieces of paper and pasted them on his bed, desk, chair, wall, and even mosquito net. He read them in turn as soon as he opened his eyes in the morning and as soon as he went to bed at night, read them again, then memorized them again, and recalled them in connection, and his study efficiency was greatly improved.
    After completing junior high and high school courses, he made a plan to learn foreign languages. Some people laughed at him when they found out, but he did not flinch and became even more determined. Once, on a business trip to Beijing, he accidentally saw an advertisement for recruiting German language students and thought, "The German enamel industry is developed, so let's learn German first!" So he signed up to study every night. He had just learned the twenty-six letters when he returned to the factory, but he insisted on self-study in his spare time. From then on, he had a German dictionary with him.
    Foreign languages are more difficult to read and remember than other subjects. He adopted the old method of pasting paper strips and made a lot of cardboard pieces, wrote words on them, and put them in his pocket. He took them out one by one and memorized them when he went to the toilet and when he walked. After more than a year of hard practice, he was finally able to read German books about the enamel industry with the help of a dictionary. Later, he also learned Russian, French, and Polish.
    Gou Wenbin stepped into the gate of culture and science step by step. Once he combined his rich production experience with culture and science to solve production problems, his work immediately showed a new outlook. Once, the factory had a cup bottom cracking accident again. He walked into the workshop and knew from experience that this accident often happened when the cup was taken out of the furnace and shaped on the iron plate. He thought: the iron plate is too cold, the cup is too hot, isn't this in line with the principle of "sudden cold and heat changes" in physics? So he immediately used soft asbestos pads on the cold iron plate, and quickly solved the accident.
    In 1958, the factory accepted the new task of producing industrial enamel. At that time, the biggest difficulty encountered was the lack of equipment, and the existing earthen kilns could not reach the furnace temperature necessary to produce industrial enamel with extremely high acid resistance. Many technicians were helpless. Gou Wenbin and several veteran workers went to the Party General Branch Secretary and proposed to redesign a low-melting-point formula. The Party supported their suggestion. In the experiment, Gou Wenbin found that to design this formula, he must first overturn an important law in technical theory books: "The acid resistance of enamel is directly proportional to the melting point of the porcelain powder." But he thought: good books are written by people in labor. So he and the old masters started working. They successively designed two hundred formulas and experimented more than two hundred times in three months, but they could not jump out of that "law." Some people began to waver, but Gou Wenbin was not discouraged. He flipped through foreign language materials one by one. One night, he suddenly discovered a feature of German formulas in a German book: In order to enhance the acid resistance of enamel, alkaline oxides can be introduced less, and alkaline earth metal oxides with strong acid resistance can be introduced more. He also thought of what he had said in physics books: Many alloys can reduce the melting point of elemental metals. He was extremely happy and thought of using alloys to lower the melting point and alkaline earth oxides to enhance acid resistance. He quickly experimented and it was successful.
    For a period of time, the factory lacked raw materials, and it seemed that production would be affected. The Party asked Gou Wenbin to study finding substitute raw materials and design some new formulas. Many of the enamel glaze formulas are rare metals. In the past, production could not be carried out if one was missing. Now, finding substitute raw materials is not a simple matter. The factory had never done this before. But Gou Wenbin accepted this task with full confidence. Soon, he indeed designed some new formulas using substitute raw materials, including the method of using a mixture of certain two raw materials to replace all iron oxide, which solved the key problem that has long existed in China's enamel glaze production.

    骏马添翼
    记重庆搪瓷厂副厂长苟文彬向文化科学进军十年
    本报记者　李祥涛
    在重庆搪瓷厂宿舍的正中，有一间不大的小房子，这里，不论寒风凛冽的冬日，不论炎热难当的夏天，每当更深夜静时总闪着明亮的灯光。夜班工人一见到它，总会连连地赞扬道“苟副厂长又在学习啦！”
    副厂长苟文彬这样不懈不怠、刻苦顽强地坚持业余自学已经整整十年了。十年前，他还是一个小学未毕业连信也写不出的学徒；现在，他已进修到大学专业课程，自学了俄、德、法、波兰四国文字，能翻译和搪瓷工业配方有关的德文和俄文技术书籍。去年，他和老工人一道写出了一部“搪瓷瓷釉设计原理”，出席了全国群英会。今年以来，他又连续设计了一些新的搪瓷瓷釉配方，解决了我国搪瓷工业生产中一些关键问题，并被聘为全国硅酸盐化学学会理事。
    苟文彬在1950年春天初到搪瓷厂时，是一个十四、五岁的学徒，见了人话不多，干起活来，尽拣重活干。1953年他入了党，1955年就达到六级技工水平。他爱学技术，又爱学文化。口袋里经常揣着个本本，在空隙时间就学习，遇着疑难见人就问。有人半开玩笑半称赞地说：“小苟快成知识分子了。”他认真地回答说：“咱厂以后要机械化，没文化还行！”
    1955年苟文彬当了工会主席和技术股副股长。有一次他领着外来的客人参观化验室，参观的人边看边向他提问题，他瞪着复杂的仪器，一句也答不出来。有人在背后挖苦他：“土包子”，他听了一声不吭，心里在想：咱工人当权坐天下，就是要领导科学！不会，要学会，谁也不是从娘肚里一落地就懂科学的！从此，他暗自下定决心，要加倍努力学文化科学。正好这年夏天，厂里发生了裂瓷事故，不解决就要停产。苟文彬急得几天几夜没合眼，一会跑到车间，一会跑到办公室，始终没找到毛病。这时，工业局来了位工程师看了看说：“是膨胀系数悬殊太大”，并且参考苏联经验顺利地解决了事故。那天下午，苟文彬久久地站在车间，望着那调整了膨胀系数后生产出来的又好又亮的口杯，跑回宿舍即刻写了张大字报，贴在墙上：“苟文彬，苟文彬，要想工作好，就要学习好！”他就这样决心要在短期内闯进文化科学的大门。
    苟文彬是全厂最忙的人，要管生产，要管生活，唯一的学习时间只有早晨和晚上。每天，他天不亮就起床，晚上，一下班就不顾疲劳，伏在桌上学起来。天天如此。这样，他每周至少可以学到二十五小时以上。他每前进一步都要付出巨大的劳动。开始时什么元素符号、分子式、Ｃ角、Ｂ角、定理、定律……，常常记住这个，又忘了那个，有时越搞越糊涂，脑子里像乱麻一般。看了一遍又一遍，许多东西仍然记不住。七个多月过去了，收获很小。看看桌上的书想道：“大老粗学这玩意儿可真难呀！”
    一个下午，他正想上街去玩，党总支委员、厂长朱元来看他，问他：“小苟，学得怎样了？”苟文彬红着脸回答说：“早就不学了。”朱厂长严肃地望着他，鼓励他，要他不怕困难，坚持下去，告诉他：“咱工人阶级要改天换地，没文化行么？你是党员，你是在为党学习呀！”党总支又找了一些同志帮助他学习。苟文彬在党的鼓励下，继续开始顽强地刻苦钻研。他深知学习道路是并不平坦的，每逢遇到一个难懂的章节，不轻易问人，总是三番五次地思考，不弄懂决不放手。
    苟文彬出生在四川巴县一个穷苦的农民家里，从小死了父亲，十一岁时离开了没有读完的小学，忍饥受寒靠卖柴卖草度日，从小养成了顽强的刻苦精神，现在把这种精神用到工作和学习上来。
    在党支部的领导和一些同志的帮助下，苟文彬改进了学习方法。他订出了学习计划，规定了学习时间，在学习中进行身体锻炼，渐渐地身体好起来，学习进步也更快了。他又在学习上找窍门，有一次在一本谈记忆问题的书上看到：“一件事物，在脑海里重复出现的次数越多，印象也越深刻”，以后他在学习中把应该记的公式、定理、定律、元素符号，写成小纸条，贴在床上、桌上、椅子上、墙壁上甚至蚊帐上，早晨一睁眼，晚上一上床，就轮流读着，读完了再记一遍，又连起来回忆，学习效率果然大大提高。
    他进修完初中、高中课程后，又订出了学外文的计划，有人知道了笑话他，但他并未退缩，决心更加坚定。一次到北京出差，偶然看到招收德文补习生的广告，心想：“德国搪瓷业发达，先学德文吧！”他便报名每晚去学。刚学会二十六个字母，就回厂了，但他坚持业余自学，从此，他身上又多了本德文字典。
    外文比其它学科更难读难记，他采取了过去贴纸条的老法子，又制了不少硬纸片，写上单词，揣在口袋里。上厕所时，走路时都摸出来一个个记。一年多的苦练，终于能借着字典的帮助看有关搪瓷工业的德文书了。以后，他又学了俄文、法文和波兰文。
    苟文彬一步步走进了文化科学的大门，当他把丰富的生产经验一旦和文化科学结合，用来解决生产问题，他的工作立刻出现了崭新的局面。一次，厂里又发生了杯底裂痕事故。他走进车间，凭经验他知道这事故往往发生在口杯从炉里拿出在铁板上整型的时候，他想：铁板太冷，口杯太热，这不正合乎物理上“冷热巨变”的原理吗？便即刻用软石绵垫在冰冷的铁板上，很快把事故解决了。
    1958年，厂里接受了生产工业搪瓷的新任务。当时遇到的最大困难是没有设备，而现有的土温炉又达不到生产耐酸度极高的工业搪瓷所必需的炉温，不少技术人员对此束手无策。苟文彬和几个老工人一起去找党总支书记，提出重新设计一个低溶点配方，党支持他们这个建议。在试验中，苟文彬发现：要设计这个配方，首先必须推翻技术理论书上一个重要定律：“搪瓷的耐酸度和瓷粉溶点成正比”。但是他想：好书是人在劳动中写出来的。他就和老师傅动手干起来。他们先后设计了二百个配方，三个月中试验了二百多次，都跳不出那条“定律”的圈子。有人开始动摇了，苟文彬却不灰心，他一本本地翻阅着外文资料。有一天晚上，他在德文书上忽然发现德国配方有个特点：为了增强搪瓷耐酸度，可以少引入碱性氧化物，多引入抗酸力强的碱土金属氧化物；他又联想起物理书上曾经说过：许多合金可以降低单质金属溶点。他高兴极了，想出用合金降低溶点，用碱土氧化物增强耐酸度，他连忙试验起来，果然成功了。
    有段时间，厂里原料缺乏，眼看要影响生产了。党要苟文彬研究找代用原料，设计些新配方。搪瓷瓷釉配方中有不少是稀有金属，过去缺一种就不能生产，现在要找代用原料，这不是一件简单的事，过去厂里从来没有搞过。但苟文彬满有信心地接受了这个任务。不久，他果然设计成了一些用代用原料的新配方，其中用某两项原料混合来代替全部用氧化铁的办法，解决了我国搪瓷瓷釉生产中长期存在的关键问题。（附图片）
