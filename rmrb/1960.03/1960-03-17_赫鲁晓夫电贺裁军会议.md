Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: According to TASS, Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent a telegram to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, congratulating them on the opening of the committee meeting. The telegram stated, "The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee bears the very important and responsible task of promptly formulating practical ways to achieve comprehensive and complete disarmament, thereby realizing the recommendation of the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which was unanimously endorsed by all UN member states."

The telegram pointed out that the Soviet Union strives to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue. Last September, the Soviet government submitted a proposal on comprehensive and complete disarmament to the United Nations for discussion, and this proposal has now been submitted to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee for detailed discussion. The Soviet Union is fully determined to achieve comprehensive and complete disarmament. The Soviet Union's recent decision to further reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million people demonstrates its determination to express this resolution through concrete actions. We believe that this reduction should help create favorable conditions for the comprehensive and complete disarmament conference now being held in Geneva.

The telegram stated, "The Soviet government has instructed its representatives to work hard to make the committee's work fruitful and to formulate a comprehensive and complete disarmament treaty as soon as possible. On behalf of the Soviet government, I hope that other participants in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will also contribute to the practical solution of comprehensive and complete disarmament. The Soviet government is prepared to carefully study all proposals put forward to achieve this goal."

    赫鲁晓夫电贺裁军会议
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫打电报给十国裁军委员会，祝贺委员会会议的召开。电报说，“十国裁军委员会负有非常重要和责任重大的任务——尽速制定实现全面和彻底裁军的实际途径，从而实现联合国全体会员国一致赞同的联合国大会第十四届会议的建议。”
    电报指出，苏联力求使裁军问题摆脱僵局。去年9月，苏联政府把关于全面彻底裁军的建议提交联合国讨论，这个建议现在已经转交十国裁军委员会详细讨论。苏联充满决心要实现全面和彻底裁军。苏联不久前决定把自己的武装部队再次裁减一百二十万人，这表明了苏联力求用具体行动表示这个决心。我们认为，这次裁减应当有助于为现在在日内瓦召开的全面和彻底裁军会议创造良好的条件。
    电报说，“苏联政府已指示它的代表努力使委员会的工作取得成果，并尽速制定全面和彻底裁军条约。我代表苏联政府希望十国裁军委员会的其他与会者也为实际解决全面和彻底裁军问题作出贡献。苏联政府方面准备仔细研究为达到这个目标而提出的一切建议。”
