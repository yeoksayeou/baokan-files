Xinhua News Agency, March 19th. Telegram from the people of the capital in support of the Latin American people and celebrating the founding of the China-Latin America Friendship Association to friendly groups in Latin American countries:

    The "Capital People's Meeting to Support the Latin American People and Celebrate the Founding of the China-Latin America Friendship Association," initiated by fifteen mass and representative people's organizations in our country, was grandly held in Beijing today.
    The conference extends its highest respect and warm greetings to the Latin American people who are fighting against imperialism, defending national independence, and striving for democracy, through your association.
    The Chinese people warmly respond to "Support Latin American People's Week" and resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban people and all Latin American people against U.S. imperialist aggression!
    U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of Latin America and the world. U.S. imperialism's attack on the Latin American people is also an attack on the people of the world. The Chinese people will always stand with the Latin American people and fight to the end against U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that in this era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, with the support of peace-loving people and countries around the world, the just cause of the people of all Latin American countries will surely achieve final victory.
    The China-Latin America Friendship Association was officially established in Beijing on March 16th. The establishment of the association marks a further development of the friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people. The China-Latin America Friendship Association firmly supports the national democratic movement of the Latin American people and will make unremitting efforts to promote friendly unity and cultural and economic exchanges between the Chinese and Latin American people.
    We wish the Latin American people great victories in their struggle against imperialist aggression, in defense of national independence, and for democracy.
    Long live the victory of the national and democratic struggles of the Latin American people!
    Long live the friendly unity between the Chinese and Latin American people!
    Long live world peace!
          Capital People's Meeting to Support the Latin American People and
              Celebrate the Founding of the China-Latin America Friendship Association
