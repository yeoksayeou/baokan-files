Spring

    Spring, peach blossoms like a rosy cloud, kapok trees holding high torches, hey—Commune members! Spring is here! Spring is here! Gurgling streams, bright red wildflowers, how many red heroes have emerged along the riverbank. To create a happy spring, they sold their oxen and bought guns to charge at the old world! They sowed the seeds of spring, and dyed the flowers of spring red. Hey—Commune members! Spring is here! Spring is here! Intensify labor, learn from the red heroes! Rows of willows, greening the village entrance, here we bid farewell to comrades joining the army. To defend the happy spring, they are fighting on the distant frontier. It is they who block the storms, so that the spring of our hometown will never leave. Hey—Commune members! Spring is here! Spring is here! Intensify labor! Fight like soldiers! The wind blows the red flag, hundreds of birds sing together, how glorious is our hometown: generation after generation produces revolutionary heroes, year after year leaps forward, year after year is red, our hometown will become a beautiful garden, we are the rain and wind of spring! Hey—Commune members! Spring is here! Spring is here! Intensify labor! Let our hometown be a riot of color!

    Not afraid to wrestle on the Azure Dragon's back, able to pull teeth from a tiger's mouth! You ask who I am? My name is Not Afraid of Heaven!
  Hey! I'm called Not Afraid of Heaven! Not Afraid of Heaven, planting crops; we will make the heavens submit to us! The Old Lord of Heaven laughs heartily:
  "I am higher and bigger than you,
  Relying on heaven for food is an ancient saying!" Don't think the heavens are showing off, we are determined to subdue them! Move the sea to build reservoirs, raise high mountains to build dams!
  Unfurl the red flag to compete with him in height! If the heavens don't rain in the third month, I gently open the reservoir gate, a dragon rises to the sky with a thunderous roar, and spring rain waters the crops everywhere.
  Angering the heavens to gnash their teeth! Send floods to rampage recklessly, but they can't break through our flood barrier, we lost half an acre on the east side, but planted eight and a half acres more on the south side!
  Leap forward flowers blooming everywhere! Hahaha! Relying on heaven for food is a thing of the past, people are not afraid, heaven is afraid of us! The heavens bow their heads, I stand up, taller and bigger than the heavens!
  Hey! The People's Commune is not afraid of Heaven!

    春天（歌词二首）	张永枚
    春天桃林一片红霞，木棉高举火把，哎——社员们！春天来啦！春天来啦！流水叮咚，野花鲜红，小河边出过多少红色英雄。为了创造幸福的春天，卖牛买枪向旧世界冲锋！春天的种子是他们撒下，春天的鲜花是他们染红。哎——社员们！春天来啦！春天来啦！加紧劳动，学习红色的英雄！行行杨柳，绿了村口，在这里送别过参军的战友。为了保卫幸福的春天，他们在遥远的边疆战斗。是他们阻挡了狂风暴雨，家乡的春天才永远不走。哎——社员们！春天来啦！春天来啦！加紧劳动！像士兵一样战斗！风吹红旗，百鸟齐鸣，我们的家乡多么光荣：代代都出革命的英雄，年年跃进年年红，家乡要变成美丽的花园，我们是春天的雨和风！哎——社员们！春天来啦！春天来啦！加紧劳动！让家乡万紫千红！
    天不怕青龙背上敢打滚，老虎嘴里能拔牙！你要问我是哪个？我的名字叫天不怕！
  嘿！我叫天不怕！天不怕，种庄稼；要让老天归顺咱！老天爷，笑哈哈：
  “我比你高来比你大，
  靠天吃饭是古话！”别看老天抖威风，咱立下大志要制服他！搬来大海造水库，举起高山筑大坝！
  红旗一展和他比高下！老天三月不下雨，我轻轻推开水库闸，蛟龙上天一声雷，春雨遍地浇庄稼。
  气得老天咬崩牙！发来洪水胡乱闯，闯不开咱拦洪坝，东头伤了一亩半，南头又种上五亩八！
  遍地开放跃进花！哈哈哈！靠天吃饭成过去，人不怕天天怕咱！老天低头我站起来，比天高来比天大！
  嘿！人民公社天不怕！
