Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 11th: Basic construction departments across China are widely promoting the investment contract system with significant results.

For more than a year, in the metallurgy, coal, hydropower, petroleum, chemical, and other systems, over 75% of basic construction units (measured by total investment) have implemented the investment contract system, achieving accelerated construction speed, expanded construction scale, improved project quality, and reduced project costs. According to statistics from eleven units under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the implementation of the investment contract system, combined with efforts in other areas, has resulted in a 25% saving in investment, a 40% increase in production capacity, and a 50% reduction in construction time. According to a survey of thirteen construction units under the Ministry of Coal Industry, the planned investment after the implementation of the investment contract system and other measures, averaged 31% less than previous plans; of these, three projects were completed and put into production with actual investment savings of 26% compared to the original planned investment, a 41% increase in production capacity, and a 30% reduction in construction time. During the First Five-Year Plan, the total investment for building a pair of mine shafts typically exceeded the plan by 10% to 15%. In Guangdong Province, after fully implementing this method last year, 255 out of 565 construction units accelerated construction progress, 124 expanded construction scale, and 322 saved a total of 61.08 million yuan while ensuring quality. More than a year of practice has proven that the implementation of investment contracts can fully mobilize the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses in basic construction, and it is an effective method for China's basic construction to implement the Party's General Line, further promote the increase production and practice economy movement, and promote the development of construction undertakings in a more, faster, better and more economical manner.

The basic construction investment contract system was a product of the mass movement vigorously launched in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and was first created by the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. The method is: under the conditions of ensuring that the state's stipulated production capacity is not reduced, the completion date is not delayed, the total investment is not exceeded, and the project quality is guaranteed, the basic construction unit is responsible for arranging and contracting the use of the state's investment. After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company implemented this method, with the investment unchanged, the construction scale (calculated by production capacity) was expanded by 108% to 150% compared to the original plan.

After the implementation of the investment contract system, the authority of the construction unit was expanded and the responsibility was increased. In order to complete the contracted tasks, they more actively and proactively worked with the design, construction units, and the Construction Bank to mobilize the masses to tap potential and save investment in all aspects. After the Luoyang Refractory Material Factory implemented the investment contract, the leadership explained policies, plans, drawings, deadlines, and investments to the masses, mobilized the masses to speak out, debate, and offer suggestions to tap potential; as a result, while ensuring project quality, they saved tens of thousands of yuan in investment. With approval, these investments were used to expand the construction scale, increasing production capacity by 54%, and the construction period was shortened from three years to two years to basically complete the project. After the Gangnan Reservoir in Hebei Province implemented the investment contract system, it mobilized the masses to reasonably modify the design plan, saving 70 million yuan in investment. With approval, the funds were used to raise the reservoir dam and build two additional reservoirs, Huangbizhuang and Hengshanling, increasing the reservoir capacity from the originally planned 1.235 billion cubic meters to 2.571 billion cubic meters, increasing the annual power generation by 45%, and preventing floods and irrigating farmland two years ahead of schedule.

The implementation of investment contracts is more conducive to the unified leadership of design, construction, and construction units, close the relationship between various departments of basic construction, and promote the spirit of communist cooperation. After the Baoding Transformer Factory implemented the investment contract, the construction unit and the construction unit jointly established a factory construction committee. The construction unit educated employees to establish an overall concept of "putting the project first and loving the factory as home," and the construction unit also educated employees to actively assist the construction unit and not to "act as the owner." The two sides supported and cooperated with each other, resulting in the main factory building being completed and put into production from the planned twenty-six months to eleven months, the cost was reduced by 20.04%, the building area was expanded by 5,453 square meters, and the annual production capacity was expanded by 60% compared with the original plan.

After implementing investment contracts, basic construction units and construction enterprises in various regions have earnestly implemented the management system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" in order to reduce project costs, and better combined full-time accounting with mass accounting. In this regard, many units have adopted the method of "centralized contracting and decentralized responsibility": the construction department is responsible for accounting for project quality, wages, materials, and machinery usage fees, the supply department is responsible for accounting for material and equipment costs, the administrative department is responsible for accounting for administrative management fees, the labor management department is responsible for accounting for safety technology protection fees, and the personnel department is responsible for cadre training. These departments then passed the relevant indicators down to the grassroots teams or groups level by level, so that the masses knew both the factory's contracted indicators and the team's or group's contracted indicators, combining the partial and the whole, small accounting and large accounting. The adoption of these methods greatly improved the enthusiasm of the broad masses for caring about investment results, and a new atmosphere of everyone caring about accounting and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy emerged. Workers at the Second Engineering Department of the Taiyuan Washing and Screening Engineering Company believed that after the implementation of investment contracts and mass accounting, "they have responsibility on their shoulders, power in their hands, a clear understanding in their hearts, and full of energy," so they carefully calculated everywhere. When taking materials, they used old ones instead of new ones, and small ones instead of large ones. If they could repair it themselves, they would repair it themselves, making the construction cost of the entire engineering department 12.5% lower last year.

After the contracted indicators were passed down to the grassroots teams and groups level by level, it also prompted the workers and masses to pay more attention to ensuring the on-time and quality completion of the project. The First Engineering Department of the Second Construction and Installation Engineering Company of Hebei Province established a mass quality inspection system, with everyone caring about project quality and constructing according to the drawings everywhere, so that the Baoding Large Transformer Factory project that was contracted had a first-class product rate of 98.7%, a second-class product rate of only 1.3%, and eliminated third-class products, and was rated as the national second-class award for technology, quality, and safety.

Recently, the State Planning Commission, the State Basic Construction Commission, and the Ministry of Finance jointly held a national exchange meeting on the experience of basic construction investment contracts in Guangzhou. It was unanimously believed that the investment contract system has a huge role in accelerating the speed of basic construction, expanding the scale of construction, improving project quality, and reducing project costs. The meeting required all localities to launch a mass movement to promote the investment contract system with greater momentum and scale under the leadership of party committees at all levels, so as to promote the better and more comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of this year's basic construction tasks.

    充分调动各有关方面的积极性多快好省地进行建设
    各地广泛推行投资包干
    新华社广州11日电　我国各地基本建设部门广泛推行投资包干办法，成绩显著。
    一年多以来，全国冶金、煤炭、水电、石油、化工等系统，已有占投资总额75％以上的基本建设单位推行投资包干办法，收到了建设速度加快、建设规模扩大、工程质量提高和工程成本降低的效果。据冶金工业部十一个单位的统计，实行投资包干以后，加上其他方面的努力，共节约投资25％，提高生产能力40％，缩短工期50％。另据煤炭工业部十三个建设单位的调查，实行投资包干和采取其他措施以后的计划投资额，比以前的计划平均节约31％；其中有三个项目建成投入生产后，实际投资比原计划投资节约26％，生产能力提高41％，缩短工期30％。而在第一个五年计划期间，建设一对矿井，投资总额一般要突破计划10％至15％。广东省去年全面实行这个办法后，在五百六十五个建设单位中，有二百五十五个加快了建设进度，有一百二十四个扩大了建设规模，有三百二十二个在保证质量的前提下共节约资金六千一百零八万元。一年多来的实践证明：实行投资包干，能够充分调动基本建设方面广大群众的主动性、积极性和创造性，是我国基本建设贯彻党的总路线，进一步推动增产节约运动，促进建设事业多快好省地发展的一个有效办法。
    基本建设投资包干，是在大跃进的1958年中大搞群众运动的产物，它是由北京石景山钢铁公司首创的。办法是：由基本建设单位在保证不降低国家规定生产能力，不推迟交工日期，不突破投资总额和保证工程质量的条件下，对国家的投资自行安排，包干使用。石景山钢铁公司实行这个办法以后，投资不变，建设规模（按生产能力计算）却比原计划扩大108％到150％。
    实行投资包干办法后，建设单位的权限扩大，责任加重，他们为了完成包干任务，就更加积极主动地会同设计、施工单位和建设银行，发动群众从各个环节挖掘潜力，节约投资。洛阳耐火材料厂实行投资包干后，由领导方面向群众交政策、交计划、交图纸、交工期、交投资，发动群众鸣放辩论，献计、献策、挖掘潜力；结果，在保证工程质量的前提下，节约了几万元投资，这些投资经过批准，用于扩大建设规模，使生产能力提高54％，工期从三年缩短为两年就基本完成。河北省岗南水库实行投资包干后，发动群众合理修改设计方案，节约投资七千万元，经过批准用于加高水库大坝和增建黄壁庄、横山岭两个水库，使水库容积由原计划的十二点三五亿立方米增为二十五点七一亿立方米，年发电量增加45％，并提前两年拦洪灌溉。
    实行投资包干，更利于实行设计、建设和施工单位的统一领导，密切基本建设各部门之间的关系，发扬共产主义协作精神。保定变压器厂实行投资包干后，建设单位和施工单位共同成立建厂委员会，施工单位教育职工树立“以工程为第一，爱厂如家”的整体思想，建设单位也教育职工积极协助施工单位，不要以“业主自居”，双方互相支援、协作，结果使主要厂房建成并投入生产的时间从计划的二十六个月缩短到十一个月，成本降低20．04％，建筑面积扩大五千四百五十三平方米，年生产能力比原计划扩大60％。
    各地基本建设单位和建筑企业，在实行投资包干后，为了降低工程成本，都认真贯彻“两参、一改、三结合”的管理制度，把专职核算同群众性的核算更好地结合起来。在这方面，许多单位采取了“归口包干，分级负责”的办法：施工部门包工程质量、工资、材料和机械使用费的核算，供应部门包材料设备费的核算，行政部门包行政管理费的核算，劳动管理部门包安全技术保护费的核算，人事部门包干部培养训练。这些部门又把有关指标逐级下达到基层队或组，使群众既知道全厂的包干指标，也知道队、组的包干指标，把局部和整体、小核算和大核算结合起来。采用这些办法，大大提高了广大群众关心投资效果的积极性，出现了人人关心核算，厉行增产节约的新气象。太原洗选工程公司第二工程处的工人们认为，实行投资包干和群众核算以后，“肩上有责，手中有权，心里亮堂，浑身是劲”，因而处处精打细算，拿材料时能用旧的就不领新的，能用小的就不领大的，能自己修理就自己修理，使全工程处去年施工成本降低了12．5％。
    包干指标层层下达到基层队和组以后，也促使工人群众对保证工程按时按质地完成更加关心。河北省第二建筑安装工程公司第一工程处建立起群众性的质量检查制度，人人关心工程质量，处处按图施工，使承包的保定大型变压器厂工程，一级品达到98．7％，二级品只占1．3％，消灭了三级品，被评为全国技术质量安全二等奖。
    最近，国家计划委员会、国家基本建设委员会、财政部在广州联合召开全国基本建设投资包干经验交流会议，一致认为投资包干办法，对于加快基本建设速度、扩大建设规模、提高工程质量和降低工程成本，有着巨大作用。会议要求各地在各级党委领导下，掀起一个声势规模更大的推行投资包干办法的群众运动，促进今年的基本建设任务更好更全面地完成和超额完成。
