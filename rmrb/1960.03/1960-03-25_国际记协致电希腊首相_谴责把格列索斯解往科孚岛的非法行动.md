Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 23rd: The Secretariat of the International Organization of Journalists sent a cable to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis, expressing regret over Glezos being transferred to Corfu Island, and protesting against the damage to freedom of the press in Greece.

The cable stated that the transfer of Glezos to Corfu Island proves that "the Greek government is attempting to continue serious illegal actions by all means."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the 19th, Greek national hero Glezos was secretly escorted by the authorities from Athens to a prison on Corfu Island in the morning. Corfu Island is located on the west coast of Greece, in the Ionian Sea.

Prior to this, Athens newspaper reports stated that the Greek Supreme Court had decided to consider the appeal filed by Glezos' defense lawyer on April 8th. The appeal requested the revocation of the unreasonable judgments recently made by the judicial authorities against Glezos and Mr. Kirikos, the president of the Greek democratic newspaper "Avghi."

Observers in Athens pointed out that the authorities, without waiting for the Supreme Court's verdict, sent Glezos to that remote island in order to isolate Glezos from the mass movement to rescue him from prison, making the rescue work more difficult.

    国际记协致电希腊首相
    谴责把格列索斯解往科孚岛的非法行动
    新华社布拉格23日电　国际新闻工作者协会秘书处致电希腊首相卡拉曼利斯，对格列索斯被解往科孚岛表示遗憾，并且对希腊的出版自由所遭到的破坏提出抗议。
    电报说，把格列索斯解往科孚岛这件事证明，“希腊政府企图用一切手段继续进行严重的非法行动”。
    据新华社讯　19日希腊民族英雄格列索斯已经在早晨被当局从雅典秘密押解到科孚岛上的一个监狱。科孚岛位于希腊西海岸，在爱奥尼亚海上。
    在这以前，雅典报纸消息说，希腊最高法院已经决定在4月8日考虑格列索斯的辩护律师提出的上诉。上诉书要求撤消司法当局最近对格列索斯和希腊民主报纸“黎明日报”社社长基尔科斯的无理判决。
    雅典的观察家指出，当局不等最高法院的判决就把格列索斯押送到那个遥远的海岛上去，这是为了把格列索斯同营救他出狱的群众性运动隔绝起来，使营救工作更趋困难。
