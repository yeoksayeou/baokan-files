Ironclad Evidence of Robbery: White Pottery Lei

The white pottery *lei* was unearthed at the Yin Ruins in Anyang before the War of Resistance Against Japan and is an extremely important piece of scientific data for the study of pottery from the Shang Dynasty. It measures 13-1/8 x 12 inches. Below the mouth, there are four double-tailed *Kui* dragon patterns carved, and the belly is engraved with a *hui* pattern and triangular patterns composed of thick lines. The three protruding bull heads each have a hole for tying a rope. This *lei* is beautifully shaped, with a fine, white, and hard texture. It is made of kaolin and must be fired at a temperature above 1,000 degrees Celsius. This fully demonstrates the creative wisdom of our working ancestors more than 1,000 years before the Common Era. Whether in terms of shape, pattern, carving technique, or firing technique, it possesses a high level of skill.

The excavation of white pottery has never been plentiful, and this white pottery *lei*, after restoration, is a relatively perfect one. The American imperialists have always had meticulous plans for plundering our cultural relics. Soon after this *lei* was unearthed in Anyang, it was looted. Now, it is shamelessly displayed in the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., USA. Also looted by the American imperialists from the Yin Ruins in Anyang are the Shang Dynasty bronze double owl four-legged *you* and the bronze human-faced covered *he*, both treasures of ancient art. They are displayed in the Freer Gallery of Art along with the white pottery *lei*. (Wang Wenchang)

    强盗罪行铁证如山
    白陶罍
    白陶罍是抗战前安阳殷墟出土的，是一件研究商代陶器极重要的科学资料。它外形13——1／8×12寸，口下雕刻四个双尾的夔纹，腹部刻满回纹与粗线条组成的三角纹，突出的三个牛头内有一个系绳子的孔。这个罍造型美观，胎质细白坚硬，是用高岭土作的，须用一千度以上的热才能烧成。这充分表现了我国劳动祖先在公元前一千多年前的创造智慧，无论是造型、图案、雕刻技术、烧造技术等，都具有高度水平。
    白陶的出土，从来就不多，而这个白陶罍经过修复后，是比较完美的一个。美帝国主义者对掠夺我国文物，一向有周密的布置，当这个罍在安阳出土后不久，就把它掠夺了去。现在还恬不知耻地摆在美国华盛顿的弗立尔艺术馆中。还有安阳殷墟出土的商代青铜双鸮四足卣、青铜人面盖盉，都是古代艺术中的瑰宝，也先后被美帝国主义者盗去，和白陶罍一起摆在弗立尔艺术馆中。　（王文昶）
