Inspired by the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the broad masses of cadres and people, under the leadership of the Party, are engaged in selfless labor on various production fronts and various work posts for the construction of socialism. In order to concretely and vividly reflect the vigorous development of all aspects of our construction cause, we have opened up the "In My Post" column here, preparing to publish articles written by comrades in various production and work posts. We hope that comrades in various production and work posts will write articles about their rich and colorful work experiences and send them to us. Please indicate "In My Post" on the manuscript.
