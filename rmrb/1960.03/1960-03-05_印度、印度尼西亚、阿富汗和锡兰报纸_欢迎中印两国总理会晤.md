Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 4th - The Indian Communist Party's organ, the "New Age" weekly, published an editorial in its latest issue welcoming the agreement between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru to meet in New Delhi in April.

The editorial stated, "For all those who desire tranquility on our borders, who wish to see China and India develop their economic and political lives along their own chosen paths—and they constitute the overwhelming majority in India—this is the most heartening news of the year." "This news is even more heartening for the Indian Communists, who have been subjected to the most unprecedented and virulent slanders by people using the Sino-Indian border issue as a pretext. In fact, the Communist Party suggested long ago that the heads of the two governments should meet, and has long insisted on this proposal." "This is the first victory for the people of both countries in this unpleasant event, it is their hope for peace, for establishing good neighborly relations, and their hope for restoring friendship with each other."

The editorial pointed out that good neighborly relations should be established between India and China and that such relations should have a solid foundation. All of us should make the greatest efforts for this.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 3rd - The Indonesian "Dawn Daily" published an editorial on the 2nd, welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to New Delhi in April to meet with Prime Minister Nehru to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue.

The editorial stated that this shows that the Sino-Indian dispute can be resolved in accordance with the Bandung spirit. The editorial believes that resolving the Sino-Indian dispute through consultation is in line with the Bandung Road. It said that only the enemies of the Bandung Conference would be disappointed by this.

Xinhua News Agency, March 4th - Kabul News: The Afghan "Friendship Daily" published a commentary on February 29th, welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India to meet with Prime Minister Nehru.

The commentary stated that Afghanistan is a friend of China and India, and has always hoped that the two great Asian countries can eliminate disputes and tensions and maintain good relations.

The commentary expressed the hope that the Sino-Indian border dispute will be resolved through peaceful negotiations, thereby dispelling the unease of friends in Asia and the world about the disputes between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, March 4th - The latest issue of the Ceylonese "Tribune" weekly, published today, commented that the news that the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers will meet in New Delhi in April is "not only welcomed in Ceylon, but also throughout Asia."

The commentary, published on the first page of the "Tribune" weekly, also said, "Premier Zhou's acceptance of Prime Minister Nehru's invitation to visit New Delhi undoubtedly shows that China is willing to discuss and negotiate the complex issues arising from the existence of an undefined border between the two largest countries in Asia."

The commentary pointed out that the meeting planned by the two Prime Ministers disrupted the calculations of reactionaries in India and elsewhere who attempted to use the Sino-Indian border dispute to create long-term discord between the two countries.
