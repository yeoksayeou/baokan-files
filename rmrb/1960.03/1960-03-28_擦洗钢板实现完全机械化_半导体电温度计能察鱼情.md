    The Old Kramatorsk Machine-Building Plant in Ukraine has designed a scrubbing unit for scrubbing stainless steel plates, achieving complete mechanization of this process for the first time.

    This unit can scrub 180,000 tons of stainless steel sheets annually. Using this unit, the entire process of scrubbing off corrosive substances from the steel plates is done by machines. In terms of the degree of mechanization and automation, the new unit far exceeds the washing machine manufactured by the American “Union” company.

    All ten unique machines in this unit are controlled by photoelectric elements. They can automatically spread the steel plates from bundles one by one, immerse the steel plates in alkali solution first, and rinse them with boiling water. Then, a stream of air heated in a heater is sent to the surface of the steel plates to dry them. The steel plates are cleaned and shine like a mirror.

    Engineers at the Leningrad Institute of Fisheries Mechanization have designed a semiconductor electric thermometer that can continuously measure the temperature of seawater near the ship while the ship is sailing. This special instrument will be useful for detecting fish activity at sea.

    Schools of fish, which are targets of hunting in the ocean, usually concentrate in areas where seawater temperature changes at the intersection of various sea currents. In the past, in order to determine such areas, it was necessary to stop or slow down the ship. With the special electric thermometer, seawater temperature can be continuously measured while the ship is traveling at full speed.

    Moscow experts have designed a diamond surveyor using radioactive isotopes. With this instrument, the presence or absence of diamonds can be determined on the spot based on the testing of local soil.

    Experts have determined that irradiating diamonds with radioactive isotopes will cause them to fluoresce. The new instrument is portable and uses the isotope "Thulium-170." Using only 0.3 to 0.5 grams of this element can replace a large X-ray device.

    Geologists call this new instrument the "diamond compass."

    擦洗钢板实现完全机械化  半导体电温度计能察鱼情
    乌克兰老克拉马托尔斯克机器制造厂设计出了一种擦洗不锈钢板用的擦洗机组，第一次实现了这一工序的完全机械化。
    这台机组每年可以擦洗十八万吨不锈钢薄钢板。使用这种机组，可使擦洗钢板上的侵蚀物的全部过程由机器进行。就机械化与自动化的程度说来，新机组远远超过了美国“联合”公司制造的洗濯机。
    这个机组的所有十部独特的机器都是由光电元件控制的。它们可以自动把成捆的钢板一张张摊开，把钢板先在碱水中浸过，用沸水冲洗。然后把一股在加热器中加热的空气送到钢板表面，烘干钢板，钢板就被擦净得像镜子一样发亮了。
    列宁格勒渔业机械化研究所的工程师们设计出一种在轮船航行期间能够不断测量船边海水温度的半导体电温度计。这种特制的仪器将便于用来在海洋上侦察鱼情。
    海洋上作为捕猎对象的鱼群通常集中在各种海流交界处海水温度发生变化的地区。过去，为了确定这样的地区，必须使船停下来或者降低速度。而使用特制的电温度计，就可以在船全速行驶的时候不断地测量海水温度。
    莫斯科专家们设计出了一种利用放射性同位素的钻石勘测器，利用这种仪器可以根据对于当地土壤的试验，当场确定有无钻石存在。
    专家们确定，用放射性同位素照射钻石，就会造成钻石萤光。新仪器是可以随身携带的，它使用的同位素是“铥一七○”。一共只要使用零点三到零点五克这种元素，就可以代替一台庞大的X射线装置。
    地质学家们把这种新仪器叫做“钻石指南针”。
