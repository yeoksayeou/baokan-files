Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: The Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee issued an appeal on March 1st to the Asia-Africa Solidarity Committees of the Soviet Union, China, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia, expressing its hope that the solidarity committees of these countries would give support to the 13th National Unified Action against the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" to be held by the Japanese people on the 19th.

The appeal stated that the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-US military alliance is entering a decisive stage. The appeal stated that on March 19th, the Japanese people will launch the largest national movement to date against this treaty, including a general strike and mass rallies and demonstrations involving millions of people.

The appeal emphasized that with the support of Asian and African countries, the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" will deliver a heavy blow to the US-Japan imperialism and warmongers who are desperately escalating tensions in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: The National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" decided to hold mass rallies and demonstrations across the country on March 19th, during the 13th National Unified Action, on a scale similar to celebrating "May Day".

Tokyo will hold a mass rally of approximately 100,000 people with representatives from across the country participating.

This decision was made at a recent meeting of the National Council's executive committee.

The meeting also decided to convene a national representative conference of local joint struggle organizations on March 18th (the eve of the 13th National Unified Action).

The meeting also decided to hold a meeting of the secretariats of county-level joint struggle organizations against the "Security Treaty" on March 7th to discuss issues such as increasing grassroots joint struggle organizations and launching signature campaigns.

The meeting also unanimously agreed to launch the 14th and 15th National Unified Actions in early and mid-April, respectively, in coordination with the upsurge of the workers' spring struggle and the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

The National Council will sell one million commemorative badges against the new "Security Treaty" to raise funds for the struggle.
