    Seven Years As One Day
    Fu Xuan
    In Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 21, there is a female fine yarn spinning worker named Shen Ruzhen. She is an advanced banner for the entire factory, excellently completing her production tasks every year. She has been continuously recognized as an advanced producer in the city for seven years and has been elected as a municipal people's representative for three consecutive terms. I remember that in September of the year before last, she even went to the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania as one of the national advanced producer representatives.
    Some people might imagine that she is probably a young woman! But in fact, she is nearly forty years old, already the mother of six children, and her education is low, and her health is not good. However, her vigor and her drive are really no less than those of young people. Let's not talk about how she studies technology diligently and practices hard to become a versatile expert in production; nor about how she helps other female workers, "keeping the difficulties to herself and offering convenience to others"; just her persistent learning of culture is enough to be a model for the vast number of middle-aged female workers.
    She was originally illiterate. In 1953, when textile female workers were enthusiastically learning the then-famous Hao Jianxiu Work Method, she was very distressed. Others quickly understood and learned from newspapers and books, but she had to inquire everywhere and still couldn't keep up. She made up her mind, saying that she must become a cultured person, otherwise she wouldn't be able to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced. From then on, for seven years as one day, she worked hard to learn culture and finally reached junior high school cultural level, and now she is preparing to take the entrance exam for an amateur university.
    This is not simple! Where did she get the time? But she said: "Time, well, it's all squeezed out. People should control time, not be controlled by time."
    She first arranges the busy housework in an orderly manner. Originally, as soon as she got home, the children needed to be breastfed, the clothes of the whole family were waiting for her to wash, mend, and make, and she also had to find time to make shoe soles and knit wool. She also lived in the countryside, not only ten miles away from the factory, but also had to draw well water, empty chamber pots, and light kerosene lamps when she got home. Later, she discussed it with her husband and he agreed to take care of the heavy labor at home. Her husband is a member of the People's Commune, so doing this was no problem. She also cultivated the older children to do some light housework and take care of their younger siblings. In this way, she only did some housework that others could not replace, such as mending clothes, making clothes, knitting wool, etc., and time was squeezed out. She could also plan ahead and use the period of childbirth to do a lot of housework, making the shoe soles for the whole family, mending and making clothes and pants, arranging everything properly. After maternity leave, she concentrated on production and cultural learning.
    She is an advanced producer and a municipal people's representative. There are meetings almost every day. She is very happy to participate in exchanging experiences and discussing national affairs at the meetings, and each time it further promotes her enthusiasm for learning culture. She said, "How can you take on big things if your cultural level is not high!" She actively participates in meetings, but she has not delayed attending classes. How does she arrange it? For example: Once, she was on the middle shift, starting work at 2:30 in the afternoon, and had a cultural class from 11:45 in the morning to 1:30 in the afternoon, but the factory wanted to hold a production meeting from 12:30 to 2:00, which clearly meant that there was a conflict between the time for learning culture and the meeting. According to the general approach, the two cannot be combined, and you have to ask for leave and give up one. But she combined them. She arrived at the factory school at eleven o'clock, asked the teacher to make up for today's courses first, and then left a little earlier to attend the production meeting. There are many such examples in her case.
    Her cultural foundation is poor, so she encounters more difficulties in learning. The young students quickly understand what the teacher is teaching, but she still doesn't understand. But she has a spirit of hard study and tries every means to overcome difficulties, not letting go until she understands thoroughly. Her method is to read more, write more, and ask more. This requires even more time. She has never relaxed for a single second of her spare time, reading a book while breastfeeding her child. Even when she is pregnant, giving birth, or has a minor illness, she seizes the time to read. Will she become a bookworm? Of course not. She learns culture for better production, so she has always been able to stand at the forefront of production. Now, she has also been selected as a "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetter, one of the 10,000 advanced women in our country in 1960.

    七年如一日
    傅萱
    上海国棉二十一厂有位细纱挡车女工，名叫沈如珍。她是全厂的一面先进旗帜，哪年都出色地完成生产任务。她已经连续七年被评为市的先进生产者，连续三届被选为市人民代表。记得前年9月里，她作为全国先进生产者代表之一，还到苏联、匈牙利、罗马尼亚去过哩。
    有人想像这大概是个年青妇女吧！哪知她快近四十岁，已是六个孩子的妈妈了，而且文化也低，身体也不健康。可是她的朝气，她的干劲，实在不比青年人差。我们且不说她怎样钻研技术、勤学苦练，成为生产上的多面手；也不说她怎样帮助别的女工，“把困难留给自己，把方便送与别人”；单说她怎样坚持不懈学文化，就足够成为广大中年女工的表率了。
    她本是个文盲。1953年，纺织女工纷纷学习当时闻名的郝建秀工作法的时候，她很痛苦。人家都从报上、书上很快看懂、学会，她得到处打听、询问，还跟不上。她一狠心，说我非学成个有文化的人不可，否则没法学先进、赶先进、超先进。从那时起，到现在七年如一日，她努力学文化，终于达到初中文化水平，如今已准备考业余大学了。
    这可不简单！她哪来的时间呀？可是她说：“时间嘛，都是挤出来的，人要支配时间，不要给时间支配。”
    她先把繁忙的家务安排得井井有条。原先，她一回家，孩子要吃奶，一家大小的衣裳等着她去洗、去补、去做，还要抽功夫纳鞋底、结绒线。她又住在乡下，离厂十里远不说，回家还得吊井水、倒马桶、打洋油点灯。后来她跟丈夫商量好，由他包做家里的粗重劳动。她丈夫是人民公社社员，做这没问题。她又培养大些的孩子们做些轻便的家务劳动和看管弟弟妹妹。这样，她只做一些别人不能代替她的家务，如补衣服、做衣服、结绒线等，时间就挤出来了。她还能未雨绸缪，利用生育时期，做好许多家事，把一家大小的鞋底纳好，衣服裤子补的补、做的做，一切安排妥当。产假后上工，她就集中精力搞生产和学习文化。
    她是先进生产者，又是市人民代表，要开的会议，差不多每天都有。开会交流经验，讨论国家大事，她都很高兴参加，每次都更加促进她学文化的劲头。她说：“文化不高怎么担当大事啊！”她积极参加会议，却又没有耽误上课。她怎样安排的呢？举个例子：有一次她上中班，下午二点半要上工，上午十一点四十五分到下午一点半要上文化课，但是厂里要在十二点半到两点钟开生产会，这就明摆着学文化和会议时间有矛盾。照一般处理，两者不能兼顾，得要请假，放弃一样。可是她却兼顾了。她十一点就到厂校，找老师把今天要上的课程先补好，随后再早一点退出去参加生产会议。这样的例子，在她身上是很多的。
    她文化基础差，在学习上碰到的困难也就多一些。老师讲的课，年轻的同学们很快懂了，她却还不懂。但她有艰苦学习精神，千方百计去克服困难，不到懂透不放手。她的方法是多看、多写、多问。这就更需要时间。她从来没有放松过一分一秒的空余时间，一面给孩子喂奶还一面看书。就是在怀孕、生育、有小病的时候，也抓紧时间看书。她会变成书呆子吗？当然不会。她学文化是为更好的生产，所以她一直能站在生产前列。如今，她又被选为“三八”红旗手，是1960年我国一万个先进妇女当中的一员了。
