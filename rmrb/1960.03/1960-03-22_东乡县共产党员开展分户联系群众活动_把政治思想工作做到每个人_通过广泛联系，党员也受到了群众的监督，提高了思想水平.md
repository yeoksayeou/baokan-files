Dongxiang County Communist Party Members Carry Out Activities to Contact the Masses by Household
Bringing Political and Ideological Work to Everyone
Through Extensive Contact, Party Members are also Subject to Supervision by the Masses, Improving Their Ideological Level

(Our Dispatch) Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, is carrying out activities in rural areas in which Communist Party members contact the masses by household, making each Party member a core for contacting the masses.

After the conclusion of the all-people rectification movement in 1958, the Dongxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to maintain close ties with the masses, based on the experience of Changlin Township in the county, universally launched activities in rural areas in which Party members contacted the masses by household. Each Party member was required to frequently contact several farmers around them, adopting a heart-to-heart approach, to publicize and explain the Party's policies and ensure that the Party's policies were promptly implemented among the masses and that the opinions of the masses were collected in a timely manner.

Now, in Dongxiang County, in addition to rural Party members contacting the masses by household, many Party members from government organs, schools, industrial and mining enterprises are also contacting the masses by household or individual; moreover, members of the Communist Youth League and activists are also participating in this activity. With Party members as the core, more than three thousand contact groups composed of Party members, League members, and activists have been formed throughout the county, distributed in every corner of the county.

The activity of Party members contacting the masses by household in Dongxiang County has had significant effects. First, political and ideological work is being done down to the household and to the individual, helping the masses solve ideological problems in a timely manner and raising their political awareness. In the past, when ideological problems arose among the masses, there was often more criticism and less concrete help. This problem has been solved through Party members contacting the masses by household. Zou Shusheng, a Party member in Xiaohuang Commune, was assigned to contact five commune members, two of whom were influenced by the spontaneous trend of the wealthy middle peasants and were not active enough in their labor. Zou Shusheng frequently had heart-to-heart talks with them, educating them about the socialist future, and mobilized his wife to carry out propaganda among the female commune members of these two households. After in-depth education, the enthusiasm of the two households increased greatly, and they took the lead in everything in collective production, and were soon rated as advanced households. Second, it is possible to implement the Party's policies among the masses in a timely and concrete manner, so that the Party's policies are quickly grasped by the masses and transformed into a huge material force. After household contact, Party members publicize the Party's policies to the masses anytime and anywhere in combination with specific circumstances. Last year, when Zong Gangsheng, a Party member in Xiaohuang Commune, publicized the importance of transforming low-yield fields to the households he contacted, commune member Song Shengbao believed that although transforming low-yield fields could increase production, it required a lot of labor and fertilizer, which was not worthwhile; Zong Gangsheng guided the contact households to discuss, and in the discussion, everyone believed that low-yield fields would be low-yield year after year if they were not transformed, and high-yield year after year after transformation, which was a year of hard work for ten thousand years of happiness. Everyone actively participated in transforming low-yield fields. The masses like Party members to publicize the Party's policies very much. If Party members have not publicized to the contact households for three or two days, the masses will take the initiative to ask the Party members. Third, after the launch of Party members' household contact, the Party's organizational life has been greatly enlivened. Because Party members have to report on their work and reflect the opinions of the masses through various Party meetings, study the Party's policies, and study the current central work, they actively participate in various Party meetings. This further enlivens the Party's organizational life and promotes the work of the branch. Fourth, through household contact, Party members live among the masses and are supervised and helped by the masses, which improves the level of Party members. Through household contact, Party members throughout the county have made great progress, especially the original three hundred or so backward Party members have undergone changes. Party member Chong Huaibao of Wangqiao Commune did not hold a position in the commune or team. In the past, he believed that: there were secretaries and commune directors above, and production team leaders below, and he was a "commoner" who could not intervene in anything, could not exert his strength, and was very depressed. Therefore, he buried himself in production during the day and closed the door to sleep at night. After contacting the masses by household, he often talked with contact households about family matters, production, and the Party's policies, and helped contact households solve specific difficulties, which was greatly praised by the masses. Fifth, the result of Party members contacting the masses by household has greatly strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. Through household contact, Party members often talk to the masses and make friends with the masses; the masses also regard Party members as confidants and consult with Party members when something happens; Party members and the masses are as close as family members. Wu Fannu, a commune member of Xiaogang Commune, had a sick husband and children, which cost a lot of money and made life very difficult. Wu Jinxiang, the Party member who established contact with him, lent him the ten yuan he had saved to buy piglets to help him solve his difficulties. In particular, many Party members give convenience to contact households in their work and leave difficulties to themselves, taking the lead in everything and caring for the masses everywhere, which greatly moves the masses. They said: "Only Communist Party members can do this. They are really our good examples!"

The key to the Dongxiang County Party members' household contact activity being able to persist, form a system, and achieve new development lies in the fact that Party organizations at all levels regard this work as an important political task, strengthen leadership, and constantly wage struggles against erroneous ideas. In carrying out household contact activities, some Party members believe that it is enough to hold meetings when something happens, so why bother with this extra step? Party organizations at all levels in Dongxiang County, on the one hand, conduct a series of mass line education for Party members through Party training classes, and on the other hand, conduct blooming and contending debates on the issue of household contact through various Party meetings, laying a solid foundation in organization and ideology for carrying out Party members' household contact activities and gradually moving towards regularization and systematization.

After Party members' household contact was launched, the Dongxiang County Party Committee attached great importance to summarizing and promoting the experience in household contact work. The branch of the Shengli Brigade in Changlin Commune achieved four deliveries in guiding Party members to carry out household contact activities, namely, delivering policies, delivering tasks, delivering methods, and delivering time, so that Party members felt they had capital, methods, and confidence, and that the work was easy to do; each Party member achieved four diligences (brain diligence, mouth diligence, hand diligence, and foot diligence) and four grasps (grasping before and after meals, grasping before and after meetings, grasping before and after evaluation, and grasping during field rest time) in carrying out household contact activities, which not only carried out political and ideological work in depth, but also did not occupy production time, which was deeply welcomed by the masses. The county party committee held an on-site meeting in this branch and promoted their experience throughout the county.

Paying attention to the role of non-Party activists is another important key to carrying out household contact activities in depth. Dongxiang County has more than 36,000 peasant households and more than 190,000 people, while there are only more than 3,000 rural Party members. The large number of households and people and the small number of Party members bring certain difficulties to carrying out household contact activities in depth. Therefore, it is very important to absorb non-Party activists to participate in household contact activities. Yangqiao Commune Gangxi Brigade has many peasant households and few Party members, so the branch absorbed eight Communist Youth League members and fifteen activists to participate in household contact activities. This is also very beneficial to training and improving non-Party activists.

The Dongxiang County Party members' household contact activity has been able to persist and continue to develop because it is closely integrated with the current central work and production center, so that Party members' contact activities closely serve the central work.

### 东乡县共产党员开展分户联系群众活动  把政治思想工作做到每个人  通过广泛联系，党员也受到了群众的监督，提高了思想水平

    东乡县共产党员开展分户联系群众活动
    把政治思想工作做到每个人
    通过广泛联系，党员也受到了群众的监督，提高了思想水平
    本报讯　江西省东乡县在农村中开展党员分户联系群众活动，使每个党员都成为联系群众的核心。
    1958年结束全民整风运动后，中共东乡县委为了经常保持同群众的密切联系，根据该县长林乡的经验，在农村中普遍开展党员分户联系群众活动。要求每个党员经常与周围几户农民联系，采取谈心方式，向他们宣传和解释党的方针政策，保证党的方针政策及时贯彻到群众中去，把群众的意见及时收集上来。
    现在，东乡县除农村党员分户联系群众外，很多机关、学校、工矿、企业的党员也分户分人联系群众；还有共青团员、积极分子也参加了这一活动。全县以党员为核心，由党员、团员、积极分子组成了三千多个联系小组，分布在全县每个角落。
    东乡县党员分户联系群众活动作用显著。首先是政治思想工作做到户，做到人，及时帮助群众解决了思想问题，提高了政治觉悟。过去群众中有些思想问题，往往批评较多，具体帮助较少。通过党员分户联系群众，这个问题解决了。小璜公社党员邹书生分工联系五户社员，其中有两户社员受富裕中农自发趋势的思想影响，劳动不够积极。邹书生便经常同他们谈心，向他们进行社会主义前途教育，并动员自己的爱人向这两户的女社员展开宣传。经过深入教育，那两户社员干劲倍增，在集体生产中事事先进，项项带头，不久便被评为先进户。其次是能够及时地具体地把党的方针政策贯彻到群众中去，使党的方针政策很快为群众所掌握，变成巨大的物质力量。分户联系后，党员都随时随地结合具体情况向群众宣传党的方针政策，去年，小璜公社党员宗港生向联系户宣传改造低产田的重要意义时，社员宋生保认为改造低产田虽然能增产，但花工多、花肥多，划不来；宗港生便引导联系户讨论，在讨论中，大家认为低产田不改造年年低产，改造后年年高产，是一年辛苦，万年幸福。大家都积极参加改造低产田。群众很喜欢党员宣传党的方针政策，如果党员有三、两天没有向联系户作宣传，群众还主动向党员打问。第三是开展党员分户联系后，大大活跃了党的组织生活。由于党员要通过党的各种会议汇报工作和反映群众意见，学习党的方针政策和研究当前的中心工作，所以都积极参加党的各种会议。这样就进一步活跃了党的组织生活，推动了支部工作。第四是通过分户联系，使党员生活在群众中，受到群众的监督和帮助，这样就提高了党员的水平。通过分户联系，全县党员有很大提高，特别是原有的三百多名较落后的党员都有了转变。王桥公社党员冲怀包在社、队都未担任工作，过去他认为：上有书记社长，下有生产队长，自己是个“白身人”，遇事插不上手，有力使不出，心里很苦闷。因此，他就白天埋头生产，夜晚关门睡觉。在分户联系群众后，他经常和联系户在一起谈家事，谈生产，谈党的方针政策，还帮助联系户解决具体困难，群众非常赞扬他。第五是党员分户联系群众的结果，大大地密切了党和群众的关系。通过分户联系，党员经常找群众谈心，和群众交朋友；群众也把党员当做知心人，有事找党员商量；党员和群众亲如家人。孝岗公社社员吴反女的爱人和孩子生病，花了不少钱，生活很困难，与他建立联系的党员吴金祥便把自己留着买小猪的十元钱借给了他，帮助他解决困难。特别是许多党员在劳动中将方便让给联系户，把困难留给自己，事事带头干，处处关心群众，使群众大受感动。他们说：“这些只有共产党员才能做得到，他们真是我们的好榜样！”
    东乡县的党员分户联系群众活动，能够坚持下来，形成制度，并获得新发展，关键在于：各级党组织都把这项工作列为一项重要政治任务，加强领导，不断向错误思想展开斗争。在开展分户联系活动中，有些党员认为有事开会就行，何必多此一举。东乡县的各级党组织一面通过党训班对党员进行一系列的群众路线的教育，一面通过党的各种会议就分户联系问题开展鸣放辩论，在组织上、思想上为开展党员分户联系群众活动并逐步走向经常化制度化奠定了扎实的基础。
    党员分户联系群众开展后，东乡县委非常重视总结和推广分户联系工作中的经验。长林公社胜利大队支部在指导党员开展分户联系群众活动中做到四交，即交政策、交任务、交办法、交时间，使党员感到有本钱，有办法，心中有底，工作好做；每个党员在开展分户联系群众活动时都做到四勤（脑勤、嘴勤、手勤、脚勤）、四抓（抓吃饭前后、抓开会前后、抓评分前后、抓田间休息时间），既深入展开了政治思想工作，又不占用生产时间，深受群众欢迎。县委便在这个支部召开了现场会议，在全县推广了他们的经验。
    注意发挥非党积极分子的作用，是深入开展分户联系活动的又一个重要关键。东乡县共有三万六千多农户、十九万多人口，而农村党员只有三千多名。户多人多党员少，给深入开展分户联系活动带来一定困难。因此，吸收非党积极分子参加分户联系活动，就非常重要。杨桥公社港西大队农户多、党员少，支部便吸收八名共青团员、十五名积极分子参加分户联系群众活动。这对锻炼提高非党积极分子也很有好处。
    东乡县党员分户联系活动能够坚持下来和不断发展，还在于密切结合当前工作中心、生产中心，使党员联系活动紧紧为中心工作服务。
