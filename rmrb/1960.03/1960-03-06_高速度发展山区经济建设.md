    High-Speed Development of Mountainous Economic Construction
    Liu Jianfu, First Secretary of the CPC Nanping Prefectural Committee
    Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our Nanping Prefecture, adhering to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, achieved glorious victories in the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, greatly changing the "poor and blank" face of the mountainous areas.
    Nanping Prefecture is located in northern Fujian, also known as Minbei. It is characterized by overlapping hills, crisscrossing rivers and streams, dense forests, and abundant resources. However, due to the long-term severe devastation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, resources were severely damaged, production was backward, culture was very low, and the people's lives were extremely impoverished. After liberation, the people in the mountainous areas, under the leadership of the Party, shouldered the glorious task of developing, transforming, and building the mountainous areas. Especially since 1958, we have conscientiously implemented the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and fully exerted the superiority of the People's Communes, so that the development speed of the national economy has greatly exceeded the previous eight years after liberation. In 1958, the total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 42.9% compared with 1957, and grain output increased by 31.2%. The development of the mass steelmaking movement ended the history of "not having an inch of iron" in the Minbei mountainous areas; other industries have also greatly developed. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, another continuous Great Leap Forward was won in 1959. In that year, the total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 57.4% compared with 1958, grain increased by 21%, and diversified operations in forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations also achieved overall leap forwards; in industry, with steel as the key link, pig iron, fuel, machinery, electricity, papermaking, forestry industry, and forest product chemical industry have also greatly developed, and the total output value increased by 88.6% compared with 1958. The sustained high-speed development of economic construction in the past two years has removed the "hat" of low production in the mountainous areas, changed the status quo of "a blank sheet of paper" in industry, and changed the long-term poverty and backwardness of the mountainous areas. In 1959, the average net income per agricultural population in the whole region reached more than 100 yuan, catching up with and surpassing the income level of the plains areas.
    The high-speed development of various socialist construction undertakings in Minbei eloquently proves that the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a series of "walking on two legs" policies are completely correct. In recent years, according to the characteristics of the Minbei mountainous area, we have resolutely implemented the policy of "taking agriculture as the main task, developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, developing agriculture and forestry simultaneously, and comprehensively developing the mountainous economy" and the policy of "taking grain as the key link and engaging in comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery." Practice has proved that developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and developing agriculture and forestry simultaneously are important keys to the high-speed development of mountainous economic construction. Industry and agriculture, agriculture and forestry are interdependent and mutually promoting. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and the central link in the high-speed and proportional development of the socialist economy. Vigorously developing agriculture can provide abundant raw materials for industry and open up a vast market, promoting the rapid development of industry; at the same time, the development of industry can support agricultural production with more industrial products, accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, and promote the great development of agriculture. The development of forestry can not only provide sufficient forest resources and promote the development of the forest industry to support various socialist constructions with a large number of timber, but more importantly, it can effectively prevent floods and droughts and ensure high and bumper harvests of farmland. The three are complementary, and the leading role is played by agriculture. Therefore, in developing agricultural production, we first concentrated our main efforts on grasping grain production, conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture according to local conditions, and carrying out large-scale soil improvement, water conservancy construction, and increased fertilizer application. The Minbei area has abundant rainfall, dense forests, and abundant groundwater, resulting in a large number of mountain terraced fields with poor water flow all year round, and a large number of rotten mud fields and cold water fields with low yields. Therefore, changing serial irrigation to rotational irrigation, transforming rotten mud fields, and transforming cold water fields have become important keys to increasing production in mountainous areas. Since the winter of 1957, we have started to organize forces to carry out the "three reforms," and now the fields that need to be "three reforms" in the whole region have been basically transformed, completely changing the previous situation of "mountain fields with thousands of terraced fields, only seeing rice transplanting but not seeing harvest," and the yield per mu of grain has increased from 169 jin in the early days of liberation to 508 jin in 1959. Especially in the two years of 1958 and 1959, the average grain increase was 59.2%, which was 2.38 times higher than that during the First Five-Year Plan. In 1959, the entire prefecture averaged more than 1,400 jin of grain per agricultural population, becoming a mountainous area with a large amount of grain transferred out.
    Due to the high-speed development of agriculture, a solid material foundation was laid for vigorously developing forestry. First of all, with the development of grain production, it is possible to free up hands to manage forestry and other diversified economic production, and to draw 100,000 laborers from the agricultural front to engage in forestry production, promoting the high-speed development of forestry production. Now, forest farms have been established in every commune and team in the forest area, and production bases of timber forests, oil grass forests, bamboo forests, tea forests, and fruit forests have been generally established. In the two years of 1958 and 1959 alone, 6.63 million mu of forest were planted, which is nearly twice the total of the previous eight years after liberation. All People's Communes have established permanent forestry production professional teams. Timber logging tasks have been overfulfilled ahead of schedule year after year. In a mountainous area with a population of 2.2 million, the amount of timber felled in 1959 reached 2.6 million cubic meters. The development of forestry has ensured the storage of a large amount of forest resources and provided a large number of raw materials for industrial construction. In recent years, the entire region has transported 10 million cubic meters of timber, accumulating a large amount of funds for agricultural production. Last year, the output value of forestry and its by-products in the entire region averaged about 100 yuan per person, ensuring the needs of agricultural production funds and people's living expenses. In particular, the rapid development of forestry production has made the ideal of "mountains are green, waters are clear, and small streams flow long" a reality more quickly, effectively controlling mountain floods and soil erosion, and greatly reducing the threat of floods and droughts, creating favorable conditions for high and bumper harvests in agriculture.
    The development of agriculture has provided a large number of grains and agricultural and sideline products for industry. This directly promoted the development of industry, enabling us to vigorously develop local industries and implement "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously." According to the needs of national economic development, we have been able to be self-sufficient in iron. All counties have established machine factories and farm tool repair factories, etc., with counties having machine factories and farm tool factories with preliminary scales, and communes and teams having farm tool repair factories (stations), and most of the improved agricultural (industrial) tools have been self-made, self-repaired, and self-used. The problem of coal has been solved, breaking the theory of "no coal in Minbei." Now, not only is coal self-sufficient, but there is also a surplus. Due to the provision of a large number of raw materials by agriculture and forestry, light industry, which is closely related to people's lives, has also greatly developed. Not only does the Nanping Paper Mill, which supports 100 tons of newsprint per day across the country, have enough timber as raw materials, but a larger-scale Qingzhou Paper Mill in Sha County is also about to be completed. The large amount of branches, leaves, roots, bark, and sawdust left over from timber logging has prepared a large amount of raw materials for large-scale comprehensive utilization of timber, and many factories have been built in the entire region in the past three months. At the same time, agricultural product processing, hydropower and transportation, etc., have also leaped forward following the leap forward of agriculture and forestry. Facts have proved that agriculture must rely on industry to get rid of backwardness and gradually realize agricultural mechanization. At the same time, it is precisely because of the Great Leap Forward in industry that the technical transformation of agriculture has been accelerated and the great development of agriculture has been promoted. After the People's Communes were established, counties and communes established iron smelting bases, machine factories, and farm tool repair factories, etc. From raw material production to finished product manufacturing, many areas have achieved self-reliance, which laid a material foundation for large-scale tool reforms and technical innovations. The main reason why our prefecture has been able to promote more than 2 million new and improved tools in the past two years lies in this. The work efficiency improved by tool reforms in the entire region is equivalent to increasing the input of more than 200,000 laborers into production. Commune-run industrial transportation directly serves agricultural production. The Great Leap Forward in transportation construction has changed the congested transportation situation in mountainous areas. Highways and simple highways increased from 1,364 kilometers in 1957 to 4,376 kilometers, with counties connected by automobiles, and 81 out of 108 communes having highways, and most of the brigades having large trucks. 60,000 kilometers of large truck roads and field avenues have been newly built, basically forming a transportation network in the mountainous areas, and realizing the motorization of transportation. In the past year or so, the number of rural hydropower stations has increased from 44 to 317, and 1,874 new hydropower stations have been built, basically realizing that every commune has a hydropower station and most production teams have hydropower stations. The processing of grain, feed, and agricultural and sideline products has changed from manual operation to semi-mechanical or mechanical operation. People sing like this: "Hydropower station in front of the village, factories run behind the village, electric lights are on in every household, and machines are ringing everywhere. Industry and agriculture are developing simultaneously, supporting each other, promoting each other, and developing together."
    In our mountainous economic construction, we have adhered to putting politics in command, implementing the Party's General Line, and fully exerting the superiority of the People's Communes. Practice in the past two years has proved that the process of implementing the Party's General Line is also the process of carrying out the struggle between the two roads and the two styles. Whether the mountainous economy can develop at high speed and proportionally, there were a few "conditionalists" who looked at the conditions of mountainous economic construction from a static and one-sided point of view, emphasizing the so-called "vast land and sparse population, extensive cultivation, low yield, and inability to have a Great Leap Forward." Some people, although admitting that a Great Leap Forward is possible, believe that "there are many fields, many forests, and few laborers," and can only "grab one end and lose the other," and cannot leap forward comprehensively, at high speed, and proportionally. These ideas are actually metaphysical viewpoints of "seeing things but not people." They use this point of view to look at the laws of objective things, and do not understand the laws of socialist economic construction that can leap forward both at high speed and proportionally and comprehensively. They do not recognize that conditions are constantly moving and changing things, and do not see the decisive role of human subjective initiative in changing natural conditions. Facts have proved that mountainous economic construction can not only have a Great Leap Forward, but also can have continuous Great Leap Forwards, and can not only develop at high speed, but also can develop proportionally. If not, it would be impossible for us to have made such a great change in the "poor and blank" face of the mountainous area in just a few years. In 1959, the grain yield per unit area in our region increased by more than two times compared with the early days of liberation; timber production also increased by nearly four times compared with 1953, and other undertakings such as industry, transportation, culture, education, and health have all increased by multiples or dozens of times. All these show that the mountainous area can not only have a Great Leap Forward, but also can have continuous Leap Forwards. Marxists have always seen both favorable conditions and difficult conditions, and regard conditions as relative, developing, and changeable things. The decisive factors in using and changing these conditions are the leadership of the Party and the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of the people. This is the source of endless power for building socialism. As long as people hold high the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, emancipate their minds, break superstitions, carry forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and the spirit of continuous revolution, fully exert their subjective initiative, establish lofty ambitions, break the theory of "difficult conditions," and muster revolutionary drive, work hard, do practical work, and work skillfully, even if the conditions in the mountainous area are relatively difficult, they can still have a high-speed Great Leap Forward, and even some places with relatively poor foundations can surpass places with relatively good foundations, so that the mountainous area can catch up with the plains.
    Fully exerting the superiority of the People's Communes' large scale and high degree of public ownership and vigorously carrying out mass movements is the organizational guarantee for realizing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the simultaneous development of agriculture and forestry, and the comprehensive leap forward. In the past year or so, the People's Communes in Nanping Prefecture have generally embarked on a path of healthier, more consolidated, and more developed roads, and have shown greater and greater superiority in organizing production and organizing life. The People's Communes have a large organizational scale, a wide range of activities, unified use of natural resources, unified use of human and material resources, and adopt the mass movement policy of combining large-scale operations with professional teams, so that we can better, faster, and more comprehensively develop the mountainous economy, implement diversified operations, and ensure the high-speed and comprehensive leap forward of production. The establishment of the People's Communes is more conducive to vigorously carrying out mass movements, can more widely exert everyone's strengths, can organize large-scale operations in a larger scope, and can more deeply and meticulously divide labor and organize specialized production. More than 300,000 women have been liberated from household labor and have been put into field labor, adding a new force to production. Due to the adoption of the practice of combining large-scale operations with professional team production, 4.1 million mu of forest were planted in the entire region in half a month, which is 1.3 times more than the total forest planting in 1959. In the same area, the same labor force can increase the workload several times compared with last year, proving that the power of the mass movement is endless, and also proving that continuous leap forward is completely possible. In the past two years, in vigorously carrying out mass movements, we have grasped the center, made breakthroughs in key points, driven the overall situation, and fully utilized the combination of large movements and small movements, all-people assault movements and professional movements, organized mutual support and cooperation between industry, agriculture, and commerce, vigorously carried out the socialist labor competition of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," vigorously carried out tool reforms, and vigorously carried out technical innovations. Work efficiency has been doubled, creating unprecedented miracles. This has created a vivid situation in the mountainous area of one horse taking the lead, ten thousand horses galloping, and a comprehensive leap forward.
    In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Provincial Party Committee, we have fiercely attacked backwardness, swept away difficulties, and achieved brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction with a spirit of fearlessness. In the first year of the 1960s, we will continue to hold higher the red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, muster greater revolutionary drive, resolutely implement taking grain as the key link, developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, developing agriculture and forestry simultaneously, developing agriculture and animal husbandry simultaneously, and comprehensively developing mountainous production, and strive to achieve a sustained leap forward in 1960!

    高速度发展山区经济建设
    中共南平地委第一书记　刘健夫
    我们南平专区在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，取得1958年和1959年两年连续大跃进的光辉胜利，大大地改变了山区“一穷二白”的面貌。
    南平专区位于福建北部，也称闽北，境内山岗重叠，河溪纵横，森林茂密，资源丰富。但是由于过去长期受到国民党反动派的严重摧残，资源横遭破坏，生产落后，文化很低，人民生活极端贫困。解放后，山区人民在党的领导下肩负起开发山区，改造山区，建设山区的光荣任务。特别是1958年以来，我们认真地贯彻了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，使国民经济的发展速度大大超过解放后的前八年。1958年工农业总产值比1957年增长42．9％，粮食产量增长31．2％。全民大炼钢铁运动的开展，结束了闽北山区“手无寸铁”的历史；其他工业也有很大发展。在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年又赢得了连续的大跃进。这一年工农业总产值比1958年又增长57．4％，粮食增长21％，林牧副业多种经营也都全面跃进；工业上以钢为纲，生铁、燃料、机械、电力、造纸、森工和林产化工等也都有了很大发展，总产值比1958年增长88．6％。两年来经济建设的持续高速度发展，摘掉了山区低产的“帽子”，改变了工业上“一张白纸”的现状，改变了长期以来山区贫困、山区落后的局面。1959年全区农业人口每人平均纯收入达到百元以上，赶上和超过了平原地区的收入水平。
    闽北各项社会主义建设事业高速度的发展，雄辩地证明了党的社会主义建设总路线和一系列的“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的。几年来，我们根据闽北山区的特点，坚决地贯彻了“以农为主、工农并举、农林并举，全面发展山区经济”和“以粮为纲，农林牧副渔综合经营”的方针。实践证明：工农并举，农林并举，是高速度发展山区经济建设的重要关键。工业和农业，农业和林业，是互相依存而又相互促进的。农业是国民经济基础，也是高速度按比例发展社会主义经济的中心环节，大力发展农业，就能为工业提供丰富的原料和开辟广大的市场，促进工业的飞跃发展；同时，工业的发展能够以更多的工业品支持农业生产，加速农业的技术改造，促进农业的大发展。而林业的发展不仅可以提供充分的森林资源，促进森林工业的发展，以大批木材支援各项社会主义建设，更重要的是能有效地防止水旱灾害、保证农田的高产丰收。这三者是相辅相成，而其中起主导作用的又是农业。因此，我们在发展农业生产中，首先集中主要力量大抓粮食生产，因地制宜认真执行农业“八字宪法”，进行大规模的改良土壤，兴修水利，增施肥料等工作。闽北地区雨量充沛、森林稠密，地下水多，因而造成大量的山垅田终年水流不畅，烂泥田、冷水田数量多产量低。于是改串灌为轮灌，改造烂泥田，改造冷水田，就成为山区增产的重要关键。我们从1957年冬以来，就着手组织力量进行“三改”工作，现在全区需要进行“三改”的田地已基本改造过来，彻底改变了以往“山田串流千万丘，只见插秧不见收”的景况，粮食亩产量由解放初期的一百六十九斤增加到1959年的五百零八斤，特别是1958和1959两年中，平均粮食增长59．2％，比第一个五年计划期间增长2．38倍。1959年全专区按农业人口平均，每人有粮食一千四百余斤，成为有大批粮食外调的山区。
    由于农业的高速度发展，为大力发展林业打下了雄厚的物质基础。首先，粮食生产发展了，才有可能腾出手来经营林业等多种经济生产，得以从农业战线抽十万个劳力从事林业生产，促进了林业生产的高速度的发展。现在林区已社社队队办林场，普遍建立了成万亩的用材林、油草林、毛竹林、茶叶林、水果林等生产基地。仅在1958年和1959年的两年中，造林六百六十三万亩，将近解放后前八年总和的一倍。各人民公社都成立了常年林业生产专业队。木材采伐任务连年提前超额完成。在一个二百二十万人口的山区，1959年木材采伐数量就达到二百六十万立方米。林业的发展，保证了储积大量的森林资源，又为工业建设提供了大批原材料。几年来，全区外运木材达一千万立方米，给农业生产积累了大量资金。全区林业及其副产品的产值，去年每人平均达到百元左右，保证了农业生产资金和人们生活费用的需要。尤其是林业生产飞跃发展，使“无山不绿，有水皆清，细水长流”的理想更快地变为现实，有效地控制了山洪爆发和水土流失，大大减少了水旱灾害的威胁，为农业高产丰收创造了有利条件。
    农业的发展为工业提供了大批粮食和农副产品。这直接促进了工业的发展，使我们能够有力量大力发展地方工业，实行“工农并举”。根据国民经济发展的需要，我们已能用铁自给。各县都建立了机器厂和农具修配厂等，县县有初具规模的机器厂，农具厂，社社队队有农具修配厂（站），绝大部分的改良农（工）具作到了自制自修自用。解决了煤的问题，打破“闽北无煤”论，现在用煤不但自给，而且有余。由于农业、林业提供了大批原料，与人民生活有密切联系的轻工业也有很大的发展。不仅支援全国各地的日产百吨新闻纸的南平造纸厂有了足够的木材为原料，而一个规模更大的沙县青州造纸厂又即将建成。木材采伐所剩大量的树枝、树叶、树根、树皮、锯屑，为大搞木材综合利用准备了大量的原料，全区在最近的三个月中就建起了许多工厂。同时农产品加工，水力水电和交通运输等方面，也跟随农、林业跃进而跃进。事实证明，农业要摆脱落后状态，要逐步实现农业机械化，必须依靠工业。同时正是由于工业大跃进，才加速了农业的技术改造，促进农业大发展。人民公社化后，县县社社都建立了炼铁基地，办起了机器厂，建成了农具修配厂等，从原料生产以至到成品制造，不少地区作到了自力更生，这就为大搞工具改革，大搞技术革新奠定了物质基础。我们专区所以能够在最近两年内推广新式和改良工具二百多万件，其主要原因就在于此。全区由于工具改革提高的工效，相等于增加二十多万个劳动力投入生产。社办工业交通，直接为农业生产服务。交通建设的大跃进，改变了山区交通阻塞面貌。公路和简易公路从1957年的一千三百六十四公里，增加到四千三百七十六公里，县县通汽车，一百零八个公社中有八十一个公社有了公路，大部分大队通大车，新建了六万公里大车路和田间大道，基本上形成了山区交通网，并且实现了运输车子化。一年多来，农村水电站由四十四处，发展到三百一十七处，并且新建水力动力站一千八百七十四处，基本实现社社有水电站，绝大部分生产队有水力动力站。粮食、饲料和农副产品加工，由手工操作改变为半机械或机械操作。人们这样歌唱：“村前水电站，村后办工厂，家家电灯亮，处处机器响。工农业并举，互相来支援，互相促进好，一齐大发展。”
    我们在进行山区经济建设中坚持了政治挂帅，贯彻执行了党的总路线，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性。两年来的实践证明，贯彻执行党的总路线的过程，也是开展两条道路、两种作风的斗争过程。山区经济能不能高速度按比例发展，曾有少数“条件论”者，他们以静止的、片面的观点来看待山区经济建设条件，强调所谓“地广人稀、耕作粗放、产量低下、不能大跃进。”有些人虽然承认可以大跃进，但是又认为“田多、林多、劳力少”，只能是“抓一头，丢一头”，而不能全面地高速度按比例地跃进。这些思想，实际是“见物不见人”的形而上学的观点。他们用这种观点来看待客观事物发展的规律，不懂得社会主义经济建设既能高速度又能按比例全面跃进的规律。不承认条件是不断运动、变化着的事物，看不到人的主观能动性对于改变自然条件的决定作用。事实证明，山区经济建设不仅可以大跃进，而且可以连续地大跃进，不仅可以高速度地发展，而且可以按比例发展。如果不是这样，我们就不可能在短短的几年的时间里，使山区“一穷二白”的面貌有了极大的改观。1959年我区的粮食单位面积产量，比解放初期增长两倍多；木材生产也比1953年增长近四倍，其他如工业、交通运输和文教卫生等事业，都是成倍或者几十倍地增长。所有这些，说明了山区不仅能够大跃进，而且可以连续地跃进。马克思主义者从来就是既看到有利条件，又看到困难条件，并且把条件看成是相对的、发展的，可以改变的事物。利用和改变这些条件的决定因素是党的领导和广大人民群众的政治思想觉悟。这是建设社会主义无穷无尽的力量的源泉。只要人们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格和不断革命的精神，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，树雄心大志，破“条件困难”论，鼓足革命干劲，大干实干巧干，即使山区条件比较困难，同样可以高速度的大跃进，甚至有的基础比较差的地方，都可以超过基础比较好的地方，使山区赶上平原。
    充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，大搞群众运动，是实现工农并举、农林并举、全面跃进的组织保证。一年多来，南平专区人民公社普遍走上了更加健全巩固发展的道路，在组织生产和组织生活方面，已经显示出越来越大的优越性。人民公社组织规模大，活动范围广，统一使用自然资源，统一运用人力物力，采取大兵团作战与专业队伍相结合的群众运动方针，从而使我们能够更好更快更全面地开发山区经济，实行多种经营，保证了生产的高速度全面跃进。人民公社的建立，更有利于大搞群众运动，能够更广泛地发挥各人所长，能够在更大的范围内组织大兵团作战，能够更深入细致地分工分业组织专业生产。有三十多万妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，投入了田间劳动，为生产增加了一批生力军。由于采取了大兵团作战和专业队生产相结合的作法，今年在半个月的时间内，全区造林四百一十万亩，比1959年全年造林总和还多一点三倍。就在同一地区，还是那些劳力，工作量就能比去年增加几倍，证明了群众运动的力量是无穷无尽的，也证明了连续跃进是完全可能的。两年来，我们在大搞群众运动中，抓住中心，突击重点，带动全面，充分运用大运动套小运动，全民突击性运动和专业性运动相结合，组织工农商互相支援，相互协作，大力开展“学、比、赶、帮”的社会主义劳动竞赛，大搞工具改革，大搞技术革新，工效成倍地提高，创造了前所未有的奇迹。这就使山区出现了一马当先、万马奔腾、全面跃进的生动局面。
    在过去的十年中，我们在党中央、毛主席和省委的领导下，猛攻落后，横扫困难，用大无畏的精神，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就。在六十年代的第一年，我们将继续在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，鼓起更大的革命干劲，坚决贯彻以粮食为纲、工农并举、农林并举、农牧并举，全面发展山区生产，为实现1960年的持续跃进而奋斗！
