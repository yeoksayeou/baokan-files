    Guide Us in Running Service Stations Well

    I am a housewife, and I am now participating in the work of the People's Livelihood Service Station. The People's Daily has recently been continuously publicizing the organization of people's economic life. On February 28th, it introduced the experience of the Harbin Livelihood Service Station and also published an article by Comrade Wang Suqin, the head of a service station. On March 11th, it reported on the new life created by the residents of Shangxin Street in Chongqing, achieving collective happiness. These reports and articles have not only helped us improve our ideological understanding but also specifically told us about working methods. I am determined, under the leadership of the Party, to exert greater effort to be a good housekeeper for the people's lives, to contribute all my strength to promoting the sustained leap forward in production and helping more sisters participate in social labor.

    指导我们办好服务站
    我是一个家庭妇女，现在参加人民生活服务站的工作。人民日报最近连续宣传组织人民经济生活，2月28日介绍了哈尔滨生活服务站的经验，还发表了一位服务站站长王素琴同志的文章。3月11日又报道了重庆上新街居民创造集体幸福的新生活。这些报道和文章不仅帮助我们提高思想认识，还具体地告诉了我们工作方法。我决心在党的领导下，发挥更大干劲当好群众生活的管家人，为促进生产持续跃进、帮助更多的姐妹们参加社会劳动，而贡献我的全部力量。
