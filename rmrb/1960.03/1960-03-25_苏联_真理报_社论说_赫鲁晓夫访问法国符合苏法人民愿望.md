Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd: TASS reports that the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial on the occasion of Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev's visit to France today, saying that Khrushchev's visit to France conforms to the deep wishes of the people of the Soviet Union and France.

The editorial said that for a long historical period, the commonality of national interests in security between the two countries has been an important factor in developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and France. Both countries have suffered from the threat of the same enemy—German militarism—and the path that West Germany is now developing on does not bode well. Ignoring this factor is, at the very least, short-sighted.

The editorial said that for all the peoples of Europe, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is of paramount importance, and of course, this is also the case for the French people. Eliminating the vestiges of World War II will play a decisive role in strengthening peace in Europe and peace throughout the world.

The editorial said that the joint efforts of the two countries in achieving complete and thorough disarmament will be appreciated by the people of all countries and will also benefit France and the Soviet Union.

The editorial said that the meeting between the national leaders of France and the Soviet Union is taking place at a time when the summit conference is about to be convened. It is perfectly clear from this point that the people of all countries in the world will be watching Khrushchev's visit to France with great attention.

    苏联“真理报”社论说
    赫鲁晓夫访问法国符合苏法人民愿望
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”就苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天前往法国访问发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫的访问法国是符合苏联和法国两国人民的深切愿望的。
    社论说，在很长的历史时期中，两国在安全方面的民族利益的共同性，是发展苏联同法国之间的亲善关系的重要因素。两国都受过同一个敌人——德国军国主义的威胁，而西德现在发展的道路，没有任何好的预兆。忽视这个因素，至少是没有远见的。
    社论说，对所有欧洲各国人民来说，缔结对德和约具有首要的意义，对法国人民当然也是这样。消除第二次世界大战的残迹，在加强欧洲和平与全世界和平方面将会起决定性的作用。
    社论说，两国在达成全面彻底裁军方面的共同努力将得到世界各国人民的感谢，也有利于法国和苏联。
    社论说，法国和苏联的国家领导人的会晤，是在不久要召开最高级会议的时候举行的。从这点完全可以明显地看出，世界各国人民将会以多么大的注意力来注视赫鲁晓夫到法国的访问。
