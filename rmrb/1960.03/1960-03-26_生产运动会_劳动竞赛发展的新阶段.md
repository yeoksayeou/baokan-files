    "Production Games" - A New Stage in the Development of Labor Competitions
    Wang Hefeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Heilongjiang Province's socialist construction has now entered a new stage, and the technological revolution movement has also entered a new stage. Due to the emergence of the production games experience, labor competitions on the industrial front have also entered a new stage.
    I.
    In November 1959, after the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee held an on-site industrial conference in Jiamusi and promoted the two experiences of automated production lines and production games, the province's industrial front, based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Twelfth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee, immediately launched a new upsurge in the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. The development of the movement was exceptionally rapid, like a sudden storm, quickly sweeping across every corner of the province; the breadth and depth of the movement, the number of technological innovations, their quality, and the speed of their implementation were all unprecedented. As of the statistics on March 20 this year, the province had already seen 3,030 automated production lines and linked production lines, 5,950 automated single machines, and achieved the mechanization of 27,819 manual operations; at the same time, there was also a significant increase in major inventions and cutting-edge projects. One of the main characteristics of the movement during this period was the close combination of large-scale mass movements and technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and the main form of large-scale mass movements was production games. Therefore, the mass movement on the industrial front in Heilongjiang Province is called the technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, with production games as the main form.
    The experience of production games first appeared in the Jiamusi Textile Factory in Heilongjiang Province. Because this experience is a good form and good method for carrying out large-scale mass movements and vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, it is very popular among cadres and the masses. Therefore, after the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site industrial conference in Jiamusi, it was quickly and comprehensively promoted throughout the province, blooming everywhere. In the process of promoting this experience, this new form of competition, the production game, has continued to develop in new ways. The production game was originally an experience created in the textile industry—the Jiamusi Textile Factory—to improve workers' operating skills, and it is an experience with universal significance; however, in its methods, it has its own characteristics. Now, all walks of life on the industrial front in Heilongjiang, based on the basic spirit of the Jiamusi Textile Factory's production games and their own specific circumstances, have initially explored some specific methods suitable for the characteristics of their own units from production. Taking the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory in the machinery industry as an example, they adopted the method of mainly creating new records (using this as a standard for measuring the performance of technical demonstrations and selecting production experts), solved the problem of the small comparability of the competition based on the factory's production characteristics of many product varieties and specifications, many professional processes, many special types of work, complex product types and precision requirements, and the coexistence of large batch and single piece small batch production. From the perspective of the scope of the production games, it has developed from being held only in enterprises to holding comprehensive production games in a region with the participation of the same types of work, the same industries, or various industries. At the end of 1959, the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Department held a city-wide production game for the same type of work of plastering; in January of this year, Shuangyashan City held a production game for the same industry of the coal system; in the same month, Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Hegang, Jixi, and other cities also successively held city-wide comprehensive production games. From the perspective of the problems solved by the production games, within the enterprise, almost all aspects of work, from completing production and construction plans, carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, improving enterprise management, to cultural, educational, health, and life service work, are carried out in the form of production games. Now, not only industrial departments are engaged in production games, but financial and trade, cultural and educational departments are also engaged in them. Practice has proven that, wherever production games are held, production efficiency increases exponentially within a month or two. This is a relatively common phenomenon. In January this year, most regions in Heilongjiang held "opening red" production games. As a result, the total industrial output value plan was overfulfilled by 17.3% seven days ahead of schedule, and the average daily output value increased by 12.3% compared with December 1959 and 74.9% compared with the same period in 1959, achieving the victory of "opening red," thereby fundamentally changing the "conventional" looseness at the beginning of the year.
    How did the name "production game" come about? Because it is a method of carrying out large-scale production movements in the form of an "athletic meet." It is a new form of competition created based on the requirements of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, large-scale mass movements, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, combined with the characteristics of industrial production, and on the basis of summarizing and absorbing past experiences in labor competitions, learning from and imitating the form of athletic meets. In terms of form, it very vividly adopts the names of many competition events of athletic meets and some of its honorary titles, such as sprint, long-distance race, tug-of-war, relay race, mountain climbing race, etc., as well as champion, runner-up, athlete, graded athlete, etc.; but its content is to solve various problems in industrial production. It not only imitated some forms of athletic meets, but also learned many advantages in its competition methods and organizational work. As everyone knows, athletic meets are activities with broad mass participation, the competition events are very specific, and have strong comparability; the competition forms are lively and vivid, and are welcomed by the masses; the competition methods are all direct competitions, and the organizational work is meticulous and detailed; the contestants are all selected layer by layer on the basis of layer by layer technical demonstrations, selecting the best of the best; the competition procedures are divided into pre-competition practice, preliminaries, semi-finals, and finals, etc. Many of these methods can be adopted in labor competitions. At the same time, the production game also absorbed the advantages of various past competition forms, concentrated their essence, and, based on the requirements of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, large-scale mass movements, and vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, greatly developed and improved them to create a new form of competition. This new form of competition can not only be applied to the production of enterprises, but also to the management of enterprises, and even to cultural, educational, health, and life service aspects. This new form of competition not only makes labor competitions more lively, vivid, and colorful, but also can form a crisscrossing competition network with various competition forms, thereby ensuring a more comprehensive implementation of the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and safe production, and comprehensively completing production and construction plans, better realizing a sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In recent years, with the development of mass movements, socialist labor competitions have also been constantly developing. The various past competition forms have played a positive role in completing various political and economic tasks. However, because Heilongjiang Province's socialist construction has entered a new stage of high-speed development, the development of mass movements is unprecedentedly broad and deep, and the development of technological innovation and technological revolution is exceptionally rapid, this requires a new form of competition to adapt to it. The emergence of production games is precisely such a new form of labor competition.
    II.
    So, how exactly are production games conducted? In the three months of promotion, although different regions, industries, enterprises, and even various workshops, work sections, groups, and departments within an enterprise, have their own characteristics in specific methods, the basic methods generally have the following steps:
    First, fully mobilize the masses, identify key points, clarify goals, and formulate plans (including the preparation of specific competition items and evaluation conditions for the production game), and carry out preparations in ideological, organizational, and material and technical aspects. First, explain the situation, tasks, and policies to the broad masses of workers, and carry out free airing of views and debates; adopt a method combining leadership and the masses, conduct comprehensive and in-depth investigation and research, clarify the situation, find out the main problems, key points, and weak links existing in production technology and work, clarify what problems will be mainly solved in the production game, and then formulate a plan. The entire process of the production game must frequently and deeply conduct political and ideological work among the broad masses of workers; and the form of the game also makes it easier to vigorously and promptly conduct political and ideological education among the broad masses of workers. Conducting in-depth political and ideological work among the broad masses of workers is a basic condition for conducting production games well. This point is especially important in the first stage of the production game.
    Second, conduct large-scale drills. Large-scale drills are technical exercises and also the beginning of the competition. Many enterprises call large-scale drills preliminaries. The process of large-scale drills is the process of the masses learning advanced experience, making rationalization proposals, and improving and upgrading technology. Those participating in the drills include not only backward workers, but also advanced producers; not only ordinary workers, but also engineering and technical personnel, management personnel, and enterprise leaders. Drills include not only individual diligent study and hard practice, but also collective deliberation. During the drill period, technological innovation and technological revolution quickly formed an upsurge.
    Third, conduct layer-by-layer demonstrations, layer-by-layer selection, large-scale competitions, and select the best of the best. This stage is the peak of the production game. From groups, work sections, workshops, all the way to enterprises (if it is a regional or industry-wide production game, it will go all the way to the region and the entire industry), like holding athletic meets, conduct layer-by-layer selection on the basis of layer-by-layer technical demonstrations. Demonstrations, selections, and evaluations are actually combined together, and layer-by-layer selections are conducted on the basis of layer-by-layer demonstrations, and layer-by-layer selections are actually layer-by-layer evaluations. However, after the competition of the entire enterprise or region (i.e., the finals), a general evaluation must also be conducted.
    Fourth, systematically summarize, finalize the design, and provide complete sets. This is to systematically summarize the individual and collective advanced experiences from all aspects on the basis of layer-by-layer demonstrations and layer-by-layer selections, using the method of the mass line and the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel, and select, finalize, and provide complete sets according to the nature and series of advanced experiences. Summarizing advanced experience is closely combined with technical demonstrations and selecting advanced producers. The process of layer-by-layer technical demonstrations is the process of constantly emerging advanced experiences; the process of layer-by-layer selecting advanced producers is the process of constantly summarizing advanced experiences, selecting, finalizing, and providing complete sets of advanced experiences. After the competition of the entire enterprise or region (i.e., the finals), various advanced experiences must be comprehensively summarized and necessary evaluations and complete sets must be conducted.
    Fifth, comprehensively promote, consolidate, and improve. For various advanced experiences that have been systematically summarized, finalized, and provided in complete sets, workers must be quickly organized to learn and comprehensively promote them. In this process, special attention should be paid to the role of the advanced producers selected. For advanced experiences that have been formally evaluated, they should be incorporated into relevant rules and regulations in a timely manner to continuously improve and improve enterprise management work and consolidate the results of each production game.
    The entire process of the production game, although it can generally be divided into the above steps, the various steps are closely related to each other, and many tasks are carried out in parallel, but each step has different priorities. However, production games within the scope of workshops, work sections, and groups within an enterprise, or production games within a larger scope in a region, must be flexibly applied according to the specific situation. But no matter how many steps are divided, each production game must have a clear focus, must conduct technical demonstrations and select advanced producers, and summarize and provide complete sets of advanced experiences that appear in the demonstrations and selection of advanced producers, and conscientiously organize workers to learn and comprehensively promote them.
    III.
    What are the different characteristics and new developments of production games compared with other competition forms?
    First, it makes the scope and scale of labor competitions more extensive than before. Due to the limitations in content and form of past labor competitions, they were generally better carried out in workshops, but were worse in management departments and other departments. However, production games, due to their flexible forms and rich and colorful content, are welcomed by the broad masses of people, so they can organize all aspects of work into the competition in various forms according to the characteristics of production and work, thus making the competition have a broader mass character. For example, before the Spring Festival this year, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory's trade union held a production game for the teachers of more than 30 spare-time schools who were on winter vacation, mobilizing everyone to compete and giving "New Year's goods" to the workers, and the masses were very happy as a result.
    Second, it makes labor competitions more in-depth. The production game is based on technical demonstrations, and it closely combines comparing indicators with comparing technology. The content of the competition not only has clear comparability, but also the competition events are very detailed and specific, and almost everyone, everything, and every machine (machine tool) can have competition events, conduct demonstrations, and compete. The competition events are not only compiled according to work procedures, but some are even compiled according to the actions during operation. For example, the four work procedures before the broach processing of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory are lathe processing, and they have compiled eight items such as loading the workpiece, turning the outer circle, drilling, reaming, cutting off, and unloading the workpiece. A total of forty-four competition events were compiled for the twenty-eight work procedures of the entire processing of the broach. The entire factory compiled a total of more than 1,530 specific competition events. At the same time, in the production game, evaluations are both timely and can be closely combined with demonstrations and the selection of advanced producers. This makes labor competitions more in-depth and meticulous, and makes the broad masses of workers more enthusiastic about competing. Thus, it overcomes the shortcomings of past competitions such as the competition conditions not being specific enough, the competition of economic indicators being divorced from the competition of operating technology, and the difficulty of evaluation and the lack of timely evaluation.
    Third, it can strengthen the internal connection between various competition forms, form them into a crisscrossing competition network, and make various competitions an inseparable whole. In this way, it is better to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and safe production, and comprehensively complete production and construction plans. In recent years, many effective competition forms have been created in production movements, such as competitions for the same type of work, the same business, and counterpart competitions, etc. However, most of them belong to single-nature competitions, and there is a lack of organic connection between various competition forms, and often there are shortcomings of one-sidedness. There were also comprehensive competition forms in the past, such as red flag competitions, etc.; however, because it lacks a variety of competition forms as a foundation, and its connection with other single competition forms is not close enough, it has not very well played the role of comprehensively integrating various competition forms. One of the main characteristics of the production game is that it can truly organically combine various competition forms, making them a whole, and all play their due role. From the perspective of competition form, the production game seems to be a general principle of labor competition, and other various competition forms are specific items. Therefore, grasping the production game leads to a comprehensive development of various competition forms. In the production game, various forms of competition can be carried out around the goal of comprehensively completing the plan and in response to various problems existing in production technology or work. For example, in order to improve production efficiency, carry out "thousand-minute competitions" and "thousand-machine-hour competitions"; in order to improve product quality, carry out "first-class product champion competitions"; in order to break through key production points, carry out "fortress assault competitions"; in order to promote the common leap forward of several units producing similar products, carry out "tug-of-war competitions"; in order to improve the collaboration between upper and lower work procedures and between shifts, carry out "relay race" and "one-dragon competitions"; in order to strengthen management work, carry out "business linkage competitions" between department personnel and worker administrators, and "one line (referring to a business system) strings three rings (referring to department, workshop functional groups, and group worker administrators), ten lines are like one rope (referring to connecting the work of various business systems around the completion of production tasks) competition." Moreover, various competition forms can crisscross, and individual competitions and collective competitions are also closely combined together. For example, the assembly workshop of the Acheng Relay Factory carried out "tug-of-war competitions," "counterpart competitions," and "relay race" between two relay assembly groups. In this way, not only can each worker participate in several forms of competition at the same time, but also the competition is organized into a dense network vertically and horizontally, fully demonstrating the characteristics of the production game as a comprehensive and centralized competition form.
    Fourth, it is centered on improving and upgrading technology. It not only closely combines hard work and smart work, and powerfully promotes the development of the technological revolution, but also can ensure that the movement develops healthily and continuously. The production game is centered on improving and upgrading technology, with the selection of production experts as the lever, what is demonstrated is technology, and the key to winning in the selection also lies in technology. Therefore, in the production game, no matter what form of competition it is, it is very natural to guide the workers to study technology, improve and upgrade technology.
    In recent months, the vigorous development of technological innovation and technological revolution in Heilongjiang Province has been closely related to the promotion of the production game experience. For example, in the three and a half months of promoting the production game, the workers of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory put forward more than 26,000 rationalization proposals, equivalent to 4.9 times the total of January-October last year. In more than three months, the Songjiang Electric Machinery Factory has realized more than 4,860 technological innovations, increasing efficiency by 4 to 180 times. Through the production game, the industrial and transportation enterprises in Daowai District, Harbin City, increased the degree of mechanization of loading and unloading from 16.2% to 71.2% from February 1 to March 9.
    The production game not only promoted the leap forward development of technological innovation and technological revolution, but also promoted the development of the cultural revolution. The cultural revolution and the technological revolution are complementary. In the high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution, in order to quickly learn and master new technologies, the broad masses of workers urgently demanded to improve their cultural level. Many factories and mines have reported that after the promotion of the production game experience, the number of workers participating in spare-time school studies and the number of people attending classes have generally increased by about 20% compared with before. At the same time, a large number of mass scientific research organizations have appeared in many factories. They started with wisdom drills, carried out scientific research activities around the key points of production, and wrote 223 scientific and technological papers and research-based scientific reports. This not only promoted the cultural learning of the workers, but also promoted the development of technological innovation and technological revolution.
    Fifth, on the basis of improving thinking, it further implements the competition principle of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and making common progress," and promotes the continuous upsurge of the "study, compare, catch up, and help" movement. In the production game, because layer-by-layer selections are conducted on the basis of layer-by-layer technical demonstrations, everyone's advantages and disadvantages are very obvious. Therefore, not only can the advanced aspects of advanced producers be seen, but also their shortcomings can be seen; not only can the backward aspects of backward people be seen, but also their special skills can be discovered. At the same time, the conditions for selection are the close combination of production technology and political thought, the close combination of individuals and collectives, and the close combination of single items and all-around skills; there is a close connection between various competition forms, and the comradely cooperative and mutual assistance relationship between people and between collectives has greatly developed. Precisely because of this, in the production game, not only can the enthusiasm and creativity of individuals be fully developed, and everyone can show their talents, but also the collectivist thinking of the workers has been greatly strengthened, forming a new atmosphere of "giving way when it is convenient, going forward when it is difficult, learning when it is advanced, and helping when it is backward." The communist style of cooperation is extremely strong, the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act is greatly promoted, and the "study, compare, catch up, and help" movement is higher than each other. This mass production movement is not only a movement of the Great Leap Forward in production and a movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, but also a communist ideological education movement. It is generated on the basis of the improved political consciousness of the broad masses of workers; and in turn, it constantly consolidates and improves the communist thinking of the broad masses of workers. At the same time, it more comprehensively implements the competition principle of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and making common progress," and effectively ensures that advanced producers can comprehensively improve in ideology, technology, and production. The entire process of the production game, politics, technology, and economy are always closely combined together. The rapid improvement of production technology is the result of the improvement of the political and ideological level of cadres and the masses. In the movement, not only can the ranks of advanced producers be quickly expanded, the advanced become more advanced, and backward people are transformed into advanced people in batches, making pacesetters in rows and red flags in forests, but also various advanced experiences can be summarized and promoted in a timely and complete manner, so that the production level of advanced producers can quickly become the production level of society. In past labor competitions, the problems of not summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in a timely manner, not in complete sets, and not closely combining individuals and collectives have all been appropriately solved in the production game. At the same time, through the production game, it is also easy to concentrate some scattered and sporadic advanced experiences and match them into complete sets. Through four production games, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory has emerged with 1,779 advanced experiences, of which 489 have been matched into complete sets.
    Sixth, it not only greatly developed the mass movement, but also further strengthened enterprise management, making management work and labor competitions further combined. Originally, both labor competitions and management work were for the purpose of doing a good job in production, and they should and can be combined together. However, in the past, there was a period when some enterprise leaders always thought that engaging in competitions was mass work and had nothing to do with management, thus forming a phenomenon of management work being divorced from mass movements. In recent years, especially after the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" appeared, this problem has been gradually solved, and the production game has further solved this problem. In order to conduct the production game well, not only must there be a set of meticulous battle plans, but also a set of meticulous ideological work and organizational work; not only must the masses be fully mobilized, but also enterprise leadership and management work must be fully strengthened. Whether it is production plans, material supply, or technical issues, they must be solved accurately and in a timely manner, otherwise, it will affect the smooth development of the production game. Because the production game has promoted the rapid development of technological innovation and technological revolution and the leap forward improvement of productivity, it will inevitably promote the improvement and improvement of enterprise management work. The practice of promoting production games in the past three months has also fully proven this point. In addition to supplementing and revising some relevant rules and regulations in a timely manner in the process of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences to make them more adapted to the rapid development of productive forces, holding management work games is also an effective way to improve management work. How to adopt the method of holding production games to carry out management work competitions, so that department competitions and workshop competitions are appropriately coordinated, and management work better serves production, some experience has been initially explored. For example, the "one line strings three rings, ten lines are like one rope competition" carried out by the Harbin Flax Factory, and the "thirteen lines, one-dragon competition" carried out by the Qiqihar No. 1 Construction Engineering Company, etc., are all experiences in this regard. These competition methods, although they have their own characteristics, their common spirit is how to connect departments and workshops, and even work sections or groups, vertically according to the business system, and organically combine them horizontally among departments around the common task of serving production. These management work games have a great role in improving and improving enterprise management work. The Qinghua Tool Factory recently held a production game for management work. In nearly a month, a total of 10,000 person-times of experience in management work were exchanged, and 74 sets of experience in planning, accounting, etc. were selected and matched, 1,377 items of process regulations were revised, and 916 suggestions for reforming rules and regulations and business procedures were put forward, of which 500 have now been implemented.
    IV.
    It should also be pointed out that the production game is also a new development of the Party's mass line in industrial enterprises, which further improves the leadership and management level of enterprises.
    First, it is a very good method of concentrating superior forces, grasping key points, making segmented breakthroughs, and making comprehensive breakthroughs. Its task is to comprehensively implement the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and safe production, and comprehensively complete production and construction plans, but its focus is to solve the key and weak links in production technology. That is to say, it is using the method of grasping the main contradictions to engage in production movements. This is completely in line with the spirit that Chairman Mao often tells us that we must grasp the main contradictions of things when studying and solving problems. Chairman Mao said: "In the development process of complex things, there are many contradictions, among which there must be a main contradiction," "playing a leading and decisive role, while others are in a secondary and subordinate position. ... Grasping this main contradiction, all problems can be solved easily." In enterprises, there are often many key problems and weak links in production and technology, among which there must be one that is the most important problem—that is, the main contradiction. In the preparation stage of the production game, it is to mobilize the masses to identify key points and clarify goals, which is to grasp the main contradictions. For example, when the Jiamusi Textile Factory held its first production game, there was a problem of low product quality and large waste in production. Although there were many reasons, the main reason was that due to the increase in production tasks, a large number of newly recruited workers did not understand technology, and several hundred automatic looms were newly added, and the operating skills of the old workers were not skilled. Therefore, they determined that the first production game mainly solved the problem of workers' operation. This grasped the main contradiction at the time. Therefore, through the first production game, the technical level of workers was generally improved, the daily output increased linearly, the product quality was also significantly improved, the first-class products reached 100%, and the waste phenomenon was basically overcome. However, the old contradictions were resolved, and new problems appeared. Due to the improvement of the technical level of workers and the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in production, the imbalance of equipment, especially the manual operation part, could not keep up, and became the main problem in production. Therefore, in the second production game, they decided to focus on innovating technology and reforming equipment. This is because, in the new situation, the main contradiction has been transformed. Many other enterprises also have many similar examples. This clearly shows that the leadership level of enterprises has greatly improved, and they have begun to be able to more consciously pay attention to using the leadership method of grasping the main contradictions, grasping the center to lead the whole, and making the development of production from imbalance to balance, from balance to imbalance, and then to a new balance, thus making the production movement develop spirally forward wave after wave. This leadership method is also in line with the law of wave-like development of mass movements that Chairman Mao told us.
    Second, it fully embodies the spirit of the General Line and further develops the Party's mass line. Because the production game is a very good form of labor competition, it can fully develop people's subjective initiative and fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. It prompts people to work harder and harder, thereby concretely implementing the spirit of the General Line into every task and every person's actual actions. In terms of working methods, it fully implements the spirit of Chairman Mao's "from the masses, to the masses" and "concentrate and persevere." Each production game, from beginning to end, adopts a method combining leadership and the masses, combining top and bottom, and the "three combinations" method, and fully implements the spirit of the mass line. Precisely because of this, through each production game, not only has the political and ideological level and technical and business level of the masses been greatly improved, but also the leadership style has been significantly improved, making the entire work face of the enterprise change rapidly.
    Third, it further promotes the consolidation and development of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system. The system of cadres participating in labor has become more regular. In terms of workers participating in group management, many enterprises now combine the original worker administrators with the referees, measurers, and recorders of the production game, and run training classes to train worker administrators, so that the content of mass participation in management is more expanded and the quality has also been greatly improved. Especially because the departments have carried out management work games, listing department personnel going deep into the front line to solve problems and helping worker administrators improve their business level as evaluation conditions, this further combines professional management and mass management. The "three combinations" method has greater development and changes in the production game. Now, not only has the number of "three combinations" greatly increased, but also the forms are diverse, such as technical research groups, academies of sciences, promotion teams, shock brigades, etc.; there are fixed types and non-fixed types; there are "three combinations" within the factory and "three combinations" outside the factory. Not only that, but the content of "three combinations" has also greatly developed, having developed from solving production technical problems to mass scientific research. The "three combinations" technical research group formed around the technical key points, from proposing plans, drawing pictures, designing, researching, experimenting, preparing materials and parts, manufacturing equipment, adjusting and test driving, compiling processes to production, are all carried out jointly by the members of the "three combinations" group. Now, many major technological innovation projects are almost all the research results of the "three combinations" technical research group.
    How to improve enterprise management work, it now seems that, in addition to the political side (such as criticizing neglecting the Party's leadership, one-sided factory director responsibility system, promoting two participations, one reform, and three combinations, etc. in the past), there is also a technical side. Recently, Mudanjiang City and Harbin City have vigorously engaged in the technological revolution of management tools and calculation tools, which is a very good example in this regard. This is an important new thing with great political and economic significance. It is not only a new development of technological innovation and technological revolution (from the reform of production tools to the reform of management tools), but also points out a new direction for improving enterprise management work. Due to the promotion of new management tools, not only has the efficiency of management work been greatly improved, making management work more scientific, deeper, more meticulous, accurate, and timely, and better adapted to the needs of the development of mass movements centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, ensuring the smooth promotion of production games, but also further promoting the consolidation and development of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system, making professional management and mass management more closely combined. It can not only ensure that cadres participate in labor and have more time to go deep, summarize experience, and solve problems, but also facilitate workers to participate in management, so that they can do more management work with less time. According to the survey of Mudanjiang City, in the past, some worker administrators needed more than an hour to participate in management work every day, but after the reform of management tools and calculation tools, it only takes a few minutes. It can be seen that the reform of management tools and calculation tools can greatly promote the improvement of enterprise management work and create conditions for gradually reducing the difference between manual labor and mental labor. At the same time, due to the comprehensive reform of management tools, it will cause huge changes in the organization of enterprises, push management work to a new stage, and in turn, will further promote the leap forward development of productive forces and the change of people's mental outlook.
    Fourth, in the production game, the Party's unified leadership is further strengthened, and the organizational role of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League is fully developed. The planning and organization of leadership has been greatly strengthened, making political work and economic work further combined, vigorously engaging in mass movements and concentrating leadership further combined, and a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralization closely combined. The production game is an unprecedentedly broad and unprecedentedly deep mass movement. The deeper and more intense the development of mass movements, the more it is necessary to strengthen the Party's unified leadership. Practice has proven that strengthening the Party's unified leadership is the basic condition for fully developing the organizational role of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. Using the form of production games to vigorously engage in mass movements, without the Party's unified and strong leadership, without a comprehensive plan in the work, and without the ability to organize the strength of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League well, it is very difficult to concentrate efforts to solve the main problems to be solved in the movement in a planned and organized way. However, if the organizational role of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League is not fully developed, it is equally difficult to fully mobilize the masses, fully implement the Party's mass line, and make the movement develop more healthily and fully. The production game is a good form of vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution. The process of technological innovation and technological revolution is first a process of ideological revolution. Technological innovation and technological revolution are full of the struggle between advanced and backward ideas. In the process of layer-by-layer demonstrations, layer-by-layer selections, and selecting the best of the best, the comparison between advanced and backward is very obvious. Advanced and backward are not only reflected in technology, but also reflected in political thought. The advanced are not advanced in everything, and the backward are not backward in everything. Timely and comprehensively understand the ideological situation of all workers (including advanced, intermediate, and backward states) in the movement, and prescribe the right medicine to promptly conduct political and ideological education among the workers, actively support new things, correctly grasp the Party's policies and principles, criticize and overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas and arrogant and complacent emotions; use the method of mass self-education and the method of advanced leading backward, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the backward catch up quickly, thereby continuously improving the political and ideological level and technical and business level of the workers, continuously strengthening the unity of the workers, and continuously promoting the development of the study-compare-catch up-help movement. Doing a good job in political and ideological work is an extremely arduous task. Practice has proven that, in the production game, not only does economic work require more and more meticulous work, but also political and ideological work must be done more meticulously. The production game further promotes the close combination of political work and economic work. Therefore, both Party members and mass cadres must be familiar with production business, take the initiative to conduct ideological work and mass work around production tasks, otherwise, the work of any department will not be done well. Therefore, the promotion of the production game experience has further strengthened the Party's unified leadership over enterprises, not only in political and ideological work, but also in the leadership of economic work.
    In short, the production game is an important advanced experience with universal significance and strong vitality. The practice of promoting it for more than three months has proven that it is not only a good method for vigorously engaging in mass movements, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, and a new stage in the development of labor competitions, but also a good leadership method, which has also pushed enterprise leadership and management work to a new stage.

    The emergence and rapid promotion of the production game experience is not accidental. It

    “生产运动会”——劳动竞赛发展的新阶段
    中共黑龙江省委书记处书记　王鹤峰
    黑龙江省社会主义建设现已进入了新阶段，技术革命运动也进入了新阶段。由于生产运动会经验的出现，工业战线上的劳动竞赛也进入了一个新阶段。
    一
    1959年11月，黑龙江省委在佳木斯召开工业现场会议，推广了自动化生产线和生产运动会两个经验以后，全省工业战线技术革新和技术革命在贯彻党的八届八中全会和省委第十二次扩大全会精神的基础上，就立即掀起了一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动的新的高潮。运动的发展异常迅速，有如急风暴雨，很快就席卷全省各个角落；运动的广度与深度，技术革新数量之多、质量之高、实现之快，都是从来没有过的。截至今年3月20日的统计，全省已出现了三千零三十条自动化生产线和联动生产线，五千九百五十台单机自动化，实现了二万七千八百一十九项手工操作机械化；同时，重大的发明创造和尖端项目也有显著的增加。这个时期运动的主要特点之一，是大搞群众运动和以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命密切相结合，而大搞群众运动的主要形式，就是生产运动会。所以，黑龙江省工业战线上的群众运动，叫做以生产运动会为主要形式，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革命运动。
    生产运动会的经验，首先是在黑龙江省的佳木斯纺织厂出现的。由于这一经验是大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新和技术革命的一个好的形式和好的方法，很受干部和群众的欢迎，因此，省委在佳木斯开了工业现场会议之后，很快就在全省范围内全面推广，遍地开花。在推广这个经验的过程中，生产运动会这个新的竞赛形式又不断地有新的发展。生产运动会原来是在纺织工业——佳木斯纺织厂，为提高工人操作技术而创造的一种经验，它是一个具有普遍意义的经验；但在作法上，带有它自己的特点。现在，黑龙江工业战线上的各行各业，都根据佳木斯纺织厂生产运动会的基本精神和自己的具体情况，从生产中初步摸索出一些适合本单位特点的具体作法。以机械工业的哈尔滨量具刃具厂为例，他们根据本厂产品的品种规格多、专业工序多、特殊工种多、产品类型和精度要求复杂，以及大量成批和单件小批生产同时并存的生产特点，采用了主要以创造新纪录的办法（以此作为衡量技术表演成绩的标准和选拔生产能手的根据），解决了竞赛可比性小的问题。从开生产运动会的范围来看，已由只在企业开，发展到在一个地区召开同工种、同行业或各行各业参加的综合性的生产运动会。1959年底哈尔滨市基本建设部门就开过全市性的抹灰同工种生产运动会；今年1月，双鸭山市召开了煤炭系统的同行业生产运动会，同月，哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯、鹤岗、鸡西等市，也都先后召开了全市的综合性的生产运动会。从生产运动会所解决的问题来看，在企业内，从完成生产建设计划，开展技术革新和技术革命，改进企业管理，以至文教、卫生和生活服务等各方面工作，几乎都是采取生产运动会的形式来搞的。现在不仅是工业部门搞生产运动会，财贸文教部门也有搞的。实践证明，凡是开了生产运动会的，在个把月的时间之内，生产效率就成倍的增长。这是较普遍的现象。黑龙江今年1月份，多数地区都开了开门红生产运动会，结果提前七天超额17．3％完成了工业总产值计划，平均日产值比1959年12月增长了12．3％，比1959年同期增长了74．9％，取得了开门红的胜利，从而根本改变了历来年初松的“常规”。
    生产运动会的名字是怎样来的？因为，它是用开“运动会”的形式来大搞生产运动的一种方法。它是根据总路线、大跃进、大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新和技术革命的要求，结合工业生产的特点，在总结与吸取过去劳动竞赛经验的基础上，学习和模仿体育运动会的形式而创造的一种新的竞赛形式。在形式上，它很形象地采用了体育运动会的很多比赛项目的名字和它的一些荣誉称号，如什么短途赛、长途赛、拔河赛、接力赛、登山赛，等等，以及什么冠军、亚军、健将、等级运动员等；但其内容则是解决工业生产中各种各样的问题。它不只是模仿了体育运动会的一些形式，而且学习了它在竞赛方法和组织工作上的许多优点。大家知道，体育运动会是一种具有广泛群众性的活动，比赛项目非常具体，有强烈的可比性；比赛形式生动活泼，为群众所喜闻乐见；比赛方法都是直接赛，组织工作周密细致，选手都是在层层技术表演的基础上层层进行选拔，优中选优产生的；比赛的程序又分比赛前的练习、预赛、复赛和决赛等。这些办法在劳动竞赛中很多都可采用。同时，生产运动会还吸取了过去各种竞赛形式的优点，集中了它们的精华，根据总路线、大跃进、大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新和技术革命的要求，又把它们大大地加以发展和提高而创造出一种新的竞赛形式。这种新的竞赛形式，不仅可以运用到企业的生产中，也可以运用到企业的管理，以至文教、卫生和生活服务等各方面，这种新的竞赛形式不仅使劳动竞赛更加生动活泼、丰富多彩，而且可以把各种竞赛形式组成纵横交错的竞赛网，从而保证更全面地贯彻多快好省和安全生产的方针，全面完成生产建设计划，更好地实现持续的全面的大跃进。几年以来，随着群众运动的发展，社会主义劳动竞赛也在不断的发展。过去的各种竞赛形式，在完成各项政治任务和经济任务中，都起了积极的作用。但是，由于黑龙江省社会主义建设已进入了高速度发展的新阶段，群众运动的发展空前广泛和深入，技术革新和技术革命的发展异常迅速，这就需要一种新的竞赛形式与之相适应。而生产运动会的出现，正是这样一种劳动竞赛的新的形式。
    二
    那么，生产运动会究竟怎样开法呢？在三个多月的推广中，虽然不同地区、行业、企业，甚至一个企业内部各个车间、工段、小组和科室，在具体作法上各有特点，但基本作法，大体上有这样几个步骤：
    第一、充分发动群众，摸清关键，明确目标，制订规划（包括编制生产运动会的具体竞赛项目和评比条件），进行思想上、组织上，以及物资技术等各方面的准备工作。首先是向广大职工交形势、交任务、交政策，开展鸣放辩论；采取领导和群众相结合的方法，全面深入地调查研究，摸清情况，找出生产技术上和工作上存在的主要问题、关键和薄弱环节，明确在生产运动会中主要解决什么问题，然后订出规划。整个生产运动会的过程，都要经常地深入地向广大职工进行政治思想工作；而运动会的形式，也更便于大张旗鼓地及时深入地向广大职工进行政治思想教育。深入地向广大职工进行政治思想工作，是开好生产运动会的基本条件。在生产运动会的第一阶段，这一点尤为重要。
    第二、大练兵。大练兵就是技术上的演习，也是竞赛的开始。不少企业都把大练兵叫做预赛。大练兵的过程，就是群众学习先进经验、提合理化建议、改进和提高技术的过程。参加练兵的，不仅有后进工人，而且有先进生产者；不仅有一般工人，而且也有工程技术人员、管理人员和企业领导干部。练兵，不仅个人勤学苦练，而且集体琢磨。在练兵时期，技术革新和技术革命很快就形成了高潮。
    第三、层层表演，层层选拔，大比大赛，优中选优。这一段是生产运动会的高峰。从小组、工段、车间，一直到企业（如果是地区性的或整个行业的生产运动会，就一直到地区和整个行业），像开体育运动会一样，在层层技术表演的基础上进行层层选拔。表演、选拔和评比实际上是结合在一起的，层层选拔是在层层表演的基础上进行的，层层选拔实际上就是层层评比。不过，在整个企业或地区比赛（即决赛）之后，还要进行一次总的评比。
    第四、系统总结，定型配套。这就是在层层表演、层层选拔的基础上，把个人的和集体的，各方面的先进经验，采取群众路线的办法，领导干部、工人群众和工程技术人员三结合的办法，系统地加以总结，并按先进经验的性质和系列，选型、定型并加以配套。总结先进经验是和技术表演、选拔先进生产者紧密结合的。层层技术表演的过程，就是不断涌现先进经验的过程；层层选拔先进生产者的过程，就是不断总结先进经验、选型、定型和先进经验配套的过程。在整个企业或地区比赛（即决赛）以后，对各种先进经验还要全面加以总结，并进行必要的鉴定和配套。
    第五、全面推广，巩固提高。对于经过系统总结、定型配套的各种先进经验，要迅速组织职工学习，全面加以推广。在这一过程中，要特别注意发挥选拔出来的先进生产者的作用。对于经过正式鉴定的先进经验，要及时地纳入有关的规章制度，以不断地改进和提高企业管理工作，巩固每次生产运动会的成果。
    生产运动会的整个过程，虽然一般可分为以上几个步骤，但是各个步骤之间是相互密切联系的，很多工作都是交叉进行的，只是各个步骤有各步骤不同的重点。但是，在企业内部的车间、工段和小组范围内的生产运动会，或一个地区较大范围的生产运动会，就要根据具体情况灵活运用。但不管划分几个步骤，每次生产运动会都要有个明确的重点，都要进行技术表演和选拔先进生产者，并把在表演和选拔先进生产者中出现的先进经验加以总结和配套，以及认真组织职工学习和全面加以推广。
    三
    生产运动会与其它竞赛形式有哪些不同的特点和新的发展呢？
    第一、它使劳动竞赛的范围和规模，较前更加广泛。过去的劳动竞赛由于内容和形式上的限制，所以一般在车间开展得好一些，在管理部门和其他部门就差一些。而生产运动会，由于形式机动灵活，内容丰富多彩，为广大群众喜闻乐见，就可以根据生产和工作的特点，以多种多样的形式，把各方面的工作都组织到竞赛中来，从而使竞赛具有更广泛的群众性。例如，哈尔滨量具刃具厂在今年春节前，工会就在正放寒假的三十多个业余学校的教师中开了一次生产运动会，发动大家比赛，给职工送了“年货”，结果群众非常高兴。
    第二、它使劳动竞赛更加深入。生产运动会是以技术表演为基础，它把比指标与比技术密切结合起来。竞赛的内容，不仅有鲜明的可比性，而且比赛项目非常详细具体，几乎人人、事事、台台（机床），都可以有竞赛项目，进行表演和比赛。竞赛项目不仅按工序编，有的甚至按照操作时的动作来编。如哈尔滨量具刃具厂板牙加工前的四个工序是车床加工，他们就编制出上活、车外圆、钻孔、铰孔、切断、卸活等八个项目，整个加工上板牙的二十八道工序，共编制出四十四个竞赛项目。全厂共编制了一千五百三十多个具体的竞赛项目。同时，在生产运动会中，评比既及时，又能和表演、选拔先进生产者紧密地结合在一起。这样使劳动竞赛更加深入细致，使广大职工越赛劲头越大。从而克服了过去竞赛条件不够具体，赛经济指标与赛操作技术脱节，不易评比与评比不及时等缺点。
    第三、它能加强各种竞赛形式之间的内在联系，把它们组成一个纵横交错的竞赛网，使各种竞赛成为一个不可分割的整体。这样，就更好地保证了全面贯彻多快好省和安全生产的方针，全面地完成生产建设计划。几年以来，在生产运动中创造了很多行之有效的竞赛形式，如同工种、同业务竞赛、对口对手赛，等等。但多是属于单一性质的竞赛，各种竞赛形式之间缺乏有机的联系，往往发生片面性的缺点。过去也有综合性的竞赛形式，如红旗竞赛等；但是，由于它缺少多种多样的竞赛形式作基础，并且它和其他单一的竞赛形式联系也不够紧密，因而它也没有很好地发挥综合各种竞赛形式的作用。而生产运动会的一个主要特点，就是它能把各种竞赛形式真正有机地结合起来，使之成为一个整体，都发挥它应有的作用。从竞赛形式上看，生产运动会好像是劳动竞赛的一个纲，其它各种竞赛形式都是目，因而一抓生产运动会就纲举目张地把各种竞赛形式都带动起来了。在生产运动会中，围绕着全面完成计划的目标，针对着生产技术上或工作上存在的各种各样的问题，可以开展各种形式的竞赛。比如：为了提高生产效率，就开展“千分钟赛”，“千台时赛”；为了提高产品质量，就开展“一级品冠军赛”；为了突破生产关键，就开展“攻堡垒赛”；为了促进生产同类产品的几个单位共同跃进，就开展“拔河赛”；为了搞好上下工序、班与班之间的协作，就开展“接力赛”，“一条龙赛”；为了加强管理工作，就开展科室人员和工人管理员之间的“业务挂钩赛”、“一线（指一个业务系统）串三环（指科室、车间职能组和小组工管员）、十线一股绳（指把各业务系统的工作围绕着完成生产任务而串连起来）赛”。而且各种竞赛形式之间可以纵横交错，个人赛和集体赛也密切结合在一起。如阿城继电器厂装配车间的两个继电器装配小组之间开展“拔河赛”、“对手赛”、“接力赛”。这样，不仅每个工人同时可以参加几种形式的竞赛，而且使竞赛的上下左右、纵横交错，严密地组织成网，充分地显示了生产运动会是一种综合的和集中的竞赛形式的特点。
    第四、它是以改进和提高技术为中心的。它不仅使苦干和巧干紧密结合起来，有力地促进了技术革命的发展，而且可以保证运动健康地、持续地向前发展。生产运动会是以改进和提高技术为中心，以选拔生产能手为杠杆，表演的是技术，选拔中能否获胜的关键也在于技术。因此，在生产运动会里，不论是什么形式的竞赛，都很自然地引导职工群众去钻研技术，改进和提高技术。
    近几个月以来，黑龙江省技术革新和技术革命所以能够蓬勃的发展，是与推广生产运动会的经验密切相关的。例如，哈尔滨电机厂在推行生产运动会的三个半月的时间里，职工共提出合理化建议二万六千余件，相当于去年1—10月总和的四点九倍。松江电机厂三个多月来，共实现了技术革新四千八百六十多项，提高效率四至一百八十倍。哈尔滨市道外区工业交通企业通过生产运动会，从2月1日至3月9日，装卸机械化程度就从16．2％提高到71．2％。
    生产运动会不仅促进了技术革新和技术革命飞跃的发展，同时也推动了文化革命的发展。文化革命和技术革命是相辅而行的。在技术革新和技术革命高潮中，广大职工为了迅速学习与掌握新技术，迫切地要求提高文化水平。许多厂矿反映，推广生产运动会经验后，职工参加业余学校学习的人数和出席的人数，一般比以前增加了20％左右。同时，许多工厂出现了大量的群众性的科学研究组织。他们从智慧大练兵开始，围绕生产关键，进行科学研究活动，并写出了二百二十三篇科学技术论文和研究性的科学报告。这样，既促进了职工的文化学习，也推动了技术革新和技术革命的发展。
    第五、在提高思想的基础上，它进一步贯彻了“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的竞赛原则，推动了“学、比、赶、帮”运动的不断高涨。在生产运动会中，因为要在层层技术表演的基础上进行层层选拔，每个人的优缺点，都表现得非常明显。因此，不仅可以看出先进生产者的先进方面，而且可以看出他们的不足之处；不仅可以看出后进者的落后方面，而且可以发现他们的一技之长。同时，选拔的条件又是生产技术和政治思想密切相结合，个人和集体密切相结合，单项和全能密切相结合；各种竞赛形式之间有着密切的联系，人与人之间、集体与集体之间，同志式的合作互助关系有了很大的发展。正因为如此，所以在生产运动会中，既能充分发挥个人的积极性、创造性，人人可以大显身手，又能大大加强职工群众的集体主义的思想，形成了“见方便就让，见困难就上，见先进就学，见后进就帮”的新的风尚。共产主义协作之风极为浓厚，敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格大大发扬，“学、比、赶、帮”运动一浪高过一浪。这种群众性的生产运动不仅是一个生产大跃进的运动、技术革新和技术革命的运动，而且是一个共产主义思想教育运动。它是在广大职工政治觉悟提高的基础上产生的；反回来，它又不断地巩固和提高了广大职工的共产主义思想。同时，更全面地贯彻了“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的竞赛原则，切实保证了先进生产者在思想、技术、生产各方面能够全面的提高。整个生产运动会的过程，政治、技术和经济三者始终是紧密结合在一起的。生产技术上的迅速提高，就是干部和群众政治思想水平提高的结果。在运动中，不仅可以迅速扩大先进生产者的队伍，先进的更加先进，后进者成批转变为先进者，使标兵成列，红旗成林，而且可以及时地成套地总结与推广各种先进经验，使先进生产者的生产水平迅速成为社会的生产水平。在过去劳动竞赛中，总结和推广先进经验不及时，不成套，个人和集体不能密切结合等问题，在生产运动会中都得到了适当的解决。同时，通过生产运动会，也便于把一些分散的零星的先进经验，集中起来，搭配成套。哈尔滨量具刃具厂通过四次生产运动会，共涌现出先进经验一千七百七十九项，配成套的就有四百八十九项。
    第六、它不仅大大地发展了群众运动，而且进一步加强了企业管理，使管理工作和劳动竞赛进一步结合起来。本来劳动竞赛和管理工作都是为了搞好生产，应该而且完全可以结合起来的。但是，过去曾经有个时期，有些企业领导干部总认为搞竞赛是群众工作，与管理无关，因而形成管理工作与群众运动脱节的现象。近几年来，特别是“两参一改三结合”的经验出现以后，这一问题逐步得到解决，而生产运动会更进一步解决了这个问题。为了开好生产运动会，不仅要有一套周密的作战计划，而且要有一套细致的思想工作和组织工作；不仅要充分发动群众，而且必须全面加强企业领导和管理工作。无论是生产计划、物资供应或是技术方面的问题，都要及时地准确地加以解决，不然，就会影响生产运动会的顺利开展，由于生产运动会推动了技术革新和技术革命迅速的发展、生产力飞跃的提高，也就必然促进企业管理工作的改进和提高。三个多月以来，推广生产运动会的实践也充分证明了这一点。除了在总结与推广先进经验的过程中，及时地补充和修改一些有关的规章制度，使之与生产力的迅速发展更加适应外，开管理工作的运动会，也是改进管理工作的一个有效办法。如何采取开生产运动会的方法来开展管理工作的竞赛，使科室竞赛与车间竞赛适当地配合起来，使管理工作更好地为生产服务，现已初步摸索出一些经验。例如，哈尔滨亚麻厂开展的“一线串三环、十线一股绳赛”，齐齐哈尔市第一建筑工程公司开展的“十三条线、一条龙赛”等等，都是属于这方面的经验。这些竞赛办法，虽然各有特点，但它们的共同的精神，都是如何把科室、车间以至工段或小组，从纵的方面按业务系统串连起来，在科室相互之间围绕着为生产服务的公共任务，从横的方面有机地结合起来。这些管理工作的运动会，对改进和提高企业管理工作都有很大的作用。庆华工具厂最近开了一次管理工作的生产运动会，在近一个月的时间里，一共交流了一万人次管理工作方面的经验，选配成计划、核算等经验共七十四套，修改了工艺规程一千三百七十七项，提出了改革规章制度和业务手续的建议九百一十六件，现在已经实现了五百件。
    四
    还应该指出，生产运动会也是工业企业中党的群众路线的新的发展，它进一步提高了企业的领导和管理水平。
    第一、它是一个集中优势力量，抓住重点分段突击，全面突破的一个很好的方法。它的任务是根据全面贯彻多快好省与安全生产的方针，全面完成生产建设计划，但它的重点是解决生产技术上的关键与薄弱环节。这就是说，它是用抓主要矛盾的方法来搞生产运动。这是完全符合毛主席经常告诉我们的，研究和解决问题要抓事物的主要矛盾的精神的。毛主席说：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾”，“起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。……捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”在企业里，生产和技术上是经常存在着许多关键问题和薄弱环节的，其中也一定有一个是最主要的问题——即主要矛盾。生产运动会在其准备阶段中，就是发动群众摸清关键、明确目标，也就是要抓住主要矛盾。例如，佳木斯纺织厂在开第一次生产运动会的时候，生产上存在产品质量低与浪费大的问题，原因虽然是多方面的，但主要是因为生产任务增加，招收的大批新工人不懂技术，新增加了几百台自动布机，老工人的操作技术也不熟练。因此，他们确定第一次生产运动会主要解决职工操作的问题。这就抓住了当时的主要矛盾。因而通过第一次生产运动会，普遍提高了工人的技术水平，使日产量直线上升，产品质量也显著提高，一等一级品达到了百分之百，浪费现象基本得到克服。但是，旧的矛盾解决了，又出现了新的问题。由于职工技术水平的提高和生产大跃进的要求，设备不平衡，特别是其中的手工操作部分跟不上，又成了生产上的主要问题。因此，他们在第二次生产运动会中，就确定以革新工艺、改革设备为主要内容。这是因为在新的情况下，主要矛盾已经转化了。其他许多企业，还有不少类似这样的例子。这清楚地说明，现在企业领导水平有了很大的提高，开始能比较自觉地注意运用抓主要矛盾的领导方法，抓中心带全面，通过一个一个主要问题的解决，使生产的发展由不平衡到平衡，由平衡到不平衡，再达到新的平衡，如此循环不已，从而使生产运动一浪比一浪高地螺旋式地向前发展。这种领导方法，也是符合毛主席所告诉我们的群众运动波浪式发展的规律的。
    第二、它充分地体现了总路线的精神，进一步发展了党的群众路线。因为生产运动会是劳动竞赛的一个很好的形式，因此它能充分发挥人的主观能动性、充分发挥群众积极性和创造性。它促使人们干劲越鼓越足，从而把总路线精神具体贯彻到每一件工作和每个人的实际行动中去。在工作方法上，它充分地贯彻了毛主席所说的“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”的精神。每次生产运动会，从始到终都是采取领导和群众相结合、上下结合和“三结合”的方法来进行的，都充分地贯彻了群众路线的精神。正因为如此，通过每次生产运动会，不仅大大提高了群众的政治思想水平和技术业务水平，而且显著地改进了领导作风，使企业整个工作面貌日新月异。
    第三、它进一步促进了“两参一改三结合”制度的巩固和发展。干部参加劳动的制度更加经常化了。在工人参加小组管理方面，许多企业现在都把原来的工人管理员和生产运动会的裁判员、测定员、记录员等结合在一起，开办训练班，培训工人管理员，使群众参加管理的内容更加扩大，质量也有了很大提高。尤其是由于科室开展了管理工作的运动会，把科室人员深入现场解决问题、帮助工人管理员提高业务水平列为评选条件，这就使专业管理和群众管理进一步结合起来。“三结合”的方法在生产运动会中发展变化就更大。现在不仅“三结合”的数量大为增加，而且形式多种多样，如技术研究组、科学院、推广队、突击队，等等；有定型的，也有不定型的；有厂内的“三结合”，也有厂外的“三结合”。不仅如此，“三结合”的内容也有很大发展，已经由解决生产技术问题，发展到群众性的进行科学研究。围绕着技术关键组成的“三结合”技术研究小组，从提方案、画图、设计、研究、试验、准备材料与零件、制造设备、调整试车、编制工艺直到生产，都是“三结合”小组的成员共同动手去进行。现在，很多较重大的技术革新项目，几乎都是“三结合”技术研究小组研究的成果。
    如何改进企业管理工作，现在看来，除了有政治上的一面（如以前批判忽视党的领导、片面的厂长负责制，推行两参一改三结合等等）外，还有技术上的一面。最近，牡丹江市和哈尔滨市大搞管理工具和计算工具的技术革命，就是这方面的很好的例子。这是一个重要的新事物，具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。它不仅是技术革新和技术革命的一种新的发展（由生产工具的改革到管理工具的改革），而且给改进企业管理工作指出了新的方向。由于新的管理工具的推行，不仅大大提高了管理工作的效率，使管理工作更加科学、更加深入、细致、准确和及时，更好地适应以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动发展的需要，保证了生产运动会的顺利的推行，而且更进一步推动了“两参一改三结合”制度的巩固和发展，使专业管理和群众管理更加密切结合起来。它既可以保证干部参加劳动，并有更多的时间深入下去，总结经验，解决问题；又可以便利工人参加管理，使他们能以很少的时间作好更多的管理工作。据牡丹江市的调查，过去有些工人管理员每天参加管理工作，需要一点多钟，经过管理工具和计算工具的改革，只要几分钟就行了。由此可见，管理工具和计算工具的改革，可以大大促进企业管理工作的提高，并为逐步缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别创造了条件。同时，由于管理工具的全面改革，将要引起企业组织上的巨大变化，把管理工作推上一个新的阶段，反回来，又将进一步促进生产力的飞跃发展和人的精神面貌的改变。
    第四、在生产运动会中进一步加强了党的统一领导，充分发挥了行政、工会和共青团的组织作用。领导的计划性、组织性大大加强，使政治工作和经济工作进一步结合起来，大搞群众运动和集中领导进一步结合起来，高度的民主和高度的集中密切结合起来。生产运动会是一个空前广泛、空前深入的群众运动。群众运动发展的越深越猛，就越要加强党的统一领导。实践证明：加强党的统一领导是充分发挥行政、工会和共青团组织作用的基本条件。运用生产运动会大搞群众运动的形式，如果没有党的统一的强有力的领导，工作上没有一个全面的规划，党、政、工、团各方面的力量不能很好地组织起来，要想有领导有计划地集中力量去解决运动中所要解决的主要问题，是很困难的。但是，如果不充分发挥行政、工会和共青团的组织作用，要想充分发动群众，充分贯彻党的群众路线，使运动更健康、更饱满地发展，同样也是困难的。生产运动会是大搞技术革新和技术革命的一个好形式。技术革新和技术革命的过程，首先就是一种思想革命的过程。在技术革新和技术革命中充满了先进和落后的思想斗争。在层层表演、层层选拔、优中选优的过程中，先进和落后比较的非常明显。先进与落后不仅表现在技术上，而且表现在政治思想上。先进者并不是一切都先进，后进者并不是一切都落后。及时地全面地了解全体职工（包括先进、中间和落后三种状态）在运动中的思想状况，并对症下药地及时向职工进行政治思想教育，积极支持新生事物，正确地掌握党的方针政策，批判与克服各种右倾保守思想和骄傲自满情绪；运用群众自我教育的方法与先进带后进的方法，使先进的更先进，后进的急起直追地赶上去，从而不断提高职工群众的政治思想水平和技术业务水平，不断加强职工群众的团结，不断促进学比赶帮运动的发展。作好政治思想工作，是一个异常艰巨的任务。实践证明：在生产运动会中，不仅经济工作要求越作越细致，而且政治思想工作也要作得更加细致。生产运动会进一步促进了政治工作与经济工作的密切结合。因此，不论党员和群众干部都必须熟悉生产业务，围绕着生产任务，主动地进行思想工作和群众工作，否则，哪一个部门的工作都做不好。所以，生产运动会这一经验的推行，使党对企业的统一领导有了进一步的加强，不仅表现在政治思想工作上，而且也表现在对经济工作的领导上。
    总之，生产运动会是一个具有普遍意义的重大的先进经验，具有强大的生命力。三个多月来推行的实践证明，它不仅是大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新和技术革命的一个好的方法，是劳动竞赛发展的新阶段，而且也是一个好的领导方法，它把企业领导与管理工作也推上了一个新的阶段。五
    生产运动会经验的出现和迅速的推广不是偶然的。它是在毛泽东思想的指导下，加强党的领导，坚持总路线、大跃进，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命的结果；是贯彻党的八届八中全会和黑龙江省委第十二次扩大全会的精神，反右倾，鼓干劲，在干部中深入进行整风和在职工中深入进行社会主义、共产主义教育的结果；是广大职工共产主义精神大为高涨的结果；同时，它也是几年来认真贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制与职工代表大会制，坚决推行“两参一改三结合”制度，不断改进与提高企业领导和管理水平的结果。
    在推行生产运动会中，使我们进一步认识了：在社会主义企业里，生产关系与生产力之间、上层建筑与经济基础之间，又相适应又相矛盾的对立统一的关系；我们的生产建设是怎样在这些矛盾的斗争中不断向前发展的。在社会主义企业里，由于消灭了人与人之间的剥削关系，工人阶级成了企业和国家的主人，生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础基本上是相适应的，上层建筑与生产关系对生产力的发展具有巨大的促进作用。这正是我们社会主义制度的无比优越性，是我们的生产建设能够比资本主义国家高速度发展的根本原因。但是，这并不是说，上层建筑与经济基础之间、生产关系与生产力之间，就毫无矛盾了。正如“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文中所说的：“在基本制度适合需要的情况下，在生产关系和生产力之间，在上层建筑和经济基础之间，也仍然存在着一定的矛盾。这种矛盾表现成为经济制度和政治制度的某些环节上的缺陷。这种矛盾，虽然不需要用根本性质的变革来解决，仍然需要及时地加以调整。”在生产运动会中，由于广大职工共产主义精神的不断高涨，充分发挥了积极性和创造性，技术革新和技术革命运动迅速的发展，生产力飞跃的提高，属于生产关系和上层建筑范围的某些劳动组织、生产组织、管理制度和管理方法，由原来和生产力相适应的情况变得不相适应了，而要求根据生产力发展的需要相应地加以调整和改变，否则，它们就会阻碍生产力的发展。在推进生产运动会过程中，我们一方面看到：由于加强了党的领导和管理工作，坚持了政治挂帅与大搞群众运动的方针，有力地促进了技术革新和技术革命的发展，生产力的提高；另一方面，由于生产力的迅速提高，反回来，又推动着企业领导和管理工作不断的改进，“两参一改三结合”制度不断的发展和提高。由此可以清楚地看出在我们社会主义企业里，上层建筑与经济基础，生产关系与生产力是矛盾的统一体，通过它们之间不断的斗争，就使我们的各种工作不断地改进和提高，生产建设不断地跃进再跃进。
