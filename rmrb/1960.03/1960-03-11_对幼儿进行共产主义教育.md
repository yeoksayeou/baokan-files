    Conducting Communist Education for Young Children
    Spasova, Director of the Ninety-Ninth Kindergarten in Sofia
    Our kindergarten is located in a large building full of sunshine in the spacious garden of the Kirikov district of Sofia. There are hundreds of children here between the ages of three and seven. The task before us is to cultivate habits in children that further enhance their awareness, thirst for knowledge, and love of labor.
    Parents and residents of the district have given us much help in childcare work. All the staff of some enterprises undertake the obligation of regularly assisting the kindergarten. The children's mothers help decorate the kindergarten. We use Bulgarian national-style furniture, embroidery, and pottery to decorate the playroom so that children can approach and cherish the creations of our people from an early age.
    Close contact with parents makes it easy for us to complete our work. If children are required to do the same in kindergarten and at home, this will enable children to develop regular habits of conduct. In order to further strengthen the connection with parents, we organized "Open Days." Children's parents can attend when children are in class. This makes parents believe that kindergartens are of great significance in carrying out communist education for children.
    Last autumn, we sent our first batch of "graduates" to school. Long before this, we began to prepare some older children to go to school: visiting schools, attending classes in schools, inviting first-grade students to the kindergarten, and organizing joint performance evenings. When children from our kindergarten enter school, many teachers reflect that kindergarten education has given children a habit of loving to learn. For example, our children take care of flowers, raise rabbits and chickens, and serve meals. In this way, the children enrich their knowledge, learn to value the strength of the collective, and respect all labor.
    Thanks to the efforts of all the staff of the kindergarten and the parents, the life of our kindergarten is becoming more and more interesting and diverse. Our experience has also been enriched, which guarantees us to complete the great task of cultivating the new generation. (Attached photo)

    对幼儿进行共产主义教育
    索非亚第九十九幼儿园主任　斯帕索娃
    我们的幼儿园座落在索非亚基尔科夫区宽广的花园里，有一座充满阳光的大型楼房。这里有上百个三岁到七岁的儿童。摆在我们面前的工作是使儿童养成进一步提高他们的意识、求知欲和爱好劳动的习惯。
    家长和本区的居民在保育工作中给了我们许多帮助。一些企业全体工作人员承担经常扶助幼儿园的义务。儿童的母亲帮助装饰幼儿园。我们用保加利亚民族风格的家具、刺绣和陶器布置了游戏室，使儿童从小就接近和珍爱我国人民的创作。
    同家长的密切联系使我们容易完成自己的工作。如果在幼儿园和在家里同样要求儿童，这就使儿童养成经常的为人习惯。为了更加巩固同家长的联系，我们组织了“公开日”。在儿童上课时，儿童的父母可以出席。这使家长相信：幼儿园对儿童进行共产主义教育具有重要意义。
    去年秋天，我们给学校送去了我们第一批“毕业生”。远在这以前，我们就开始准备把一些年龄大的儿童送进学校去：参观了学校，在学校里听课，邀请一年级学生到幼儿园来，组织共同的演出晚会。在我们幼儿园的儿童入学时，许多教师对幼儿园教育的儿童提出这样的反映，幼儿园给儿童养成爱学习的习惯。例如，我们的儿童照料花，养兔和鸡，开饭。这样，孩子们丰富了知识，学会重视集体力量，尊重一切劳动。
    由于幼儿园全体工作人员和家长的努力，我们幼儿园的生活愈来愈有趣，多样化。我们的经验也得到了丰富，这保证我们完成培养新生一代的巨大任务。（附图片）
