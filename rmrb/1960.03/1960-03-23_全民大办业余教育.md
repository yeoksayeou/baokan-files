    Launch a Mass Campaign for Amateur Education

    Since the Great Leap Forward, China's amateur education has greatly developed. According to statistics at the end of 1959, more than 100 million people across the country were participating in literacy campaigns and studying in various levels of amateur schools. In the past two years, more than 70 million people have been made literate, greatly exceeding the expected requirements of the Second Five-Year Plan. 17 million workers across the country are participating in various types of amateur schools, including 170,000 participating in amateur higher education. In rural areas, more than 4.4 million people are participating in amateur secondary schools. The scale of workers and peasants participating in amateur learning is unprecedented.

    While developing full-time and part-time education, launching a mass campaign for amateur education embodies the Party's "walking on two legs" approach to running schools. Socialist education is a combination of unity and diversity. The purpose of socialist education is to cultivate laborers with socialist and communist consciousness. This nationally unified fundamental principle is the unity of socialist education. Under this unified principle, the forms of running schools are diverse, that is, the state and factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes run schools concurrently, adult education and children's education run concurrently, free education and non-free education run concurrently, and so on. The forms of schools are also diverse, including full-time schools, part-time schools, and amateur schools. The diversity of running schools, the "walking on two legs" method, is a way to provide ample learning opportunities for the broad masses of people in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Carrying out planned and guided mass amateur education is an important aspect of our education cause. It inherits and develops the school-running traditions of the old liberated areas and is a necessary condition for realizing the intellectualization of the working people. The broad masses of workers and peasants shoulder intense production tasks and cannot leave production for a long time to study exclusively. Launching a mass campaign for amateur education allows the broad masses of workers and peasants to learn while producing, closely integrating production and education.

    Vigorously developing amateur education is required for carrying out the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. It is essential for cultivating a Red and expert working-class intellectual contingent at the fastest speed. We must also see that our ultimate goal is to realize communism. Therefore, in the process of socialist construction, we must not only develop production at a high speed to greatly enrich material products; we must also gradually narrow the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and manual labor. Therefore, launching a mass campaign for amateur education is not only needed for current production and socialist construction, but also necessary for the future transition from socialism to communism. The future work of amateur education will be even more arduous. Hundreds of millions of young and adult working people (including cadres) in our country will gradually improve their political, technical, and cultural levels through amateur education. This is a major event. Under the current situation, we must vigorously eliminate the remaining illiteracy and popularize amateur primary education as soon as possible; at the same time, we must launch a mass campaign for amateur higher education and secondary vocational education.

    Illiteracy is a term for people who cannot read. People who cannot read must learn to read so as not to be illiterate. Resolutely eliminating illiteracy should be a starting point in extensively carrying out amateur education. If the task of eliminating illiteracy is not completed, amateur schools at all levels cannot be fully developed, and popularizing education among the working people will be out of the question. At present, about 65 million farmers across the country are participating in literacy campaigns. Among workers, the number of illiterates is relatively small, with the number of illiterates and semi-illiterates dropping from 80% in the early days of liberation to about 20%, among which the postal and telecommunications system has dropped to 1.5%. This situation shows that we have made great achievements in eliminating illiteracy in the past, but illiteracy has not been completely eliminated and there is still a certain number. Therefore, we must persevere in the work of eliminating illiteracy to the end. We must estimate that the current task of eliminating illiteracy may be more arduous. This is because, generally speaking, the areas with good conditions have already eliminated it. Illiterate people who find it easy to persist in learning have already shed their illiterate status. Only areas with relatively poor conditions and some people who have difficulty persisting in learning are left behind. Precisely because of this, we must earnestly grasp the final work of eliminating illiteracy. For those who have already participated in literacy learning, we must ensure that they persist in learning until they shed their illiterate status. For those who should and can participate in literacy learning but have not yet participated, we should organize them to participate in learning as much as possible. Localities should organize those who have already eliminated illiteracy to enter amateur primary schools in a timely manner. Vigorously developing amateur primary schools can consolidate the results of eliminating illiteracy and continue to improve the political, cultural, and technical levels of the working people. For those young and middle-aged people who have already escaped illiteracy in the past but are not currently participating in amateur primary schools, they should be organized to study in amateur primary schools as soon as possible. In the future, as soon as a batch of illiterates is eliminated, a batch of amateur primary schools must be set up to closely connect the two links of popularizing amateur primary education and eliminating illiteracy.

    Eliminating illiteracy and completing literacy learning is only the beginning of mastering the tool of writing, and primary amateur education is only a continuation of the stage of eliminating illiteracy. It is wrong to think that this is almost enough. For the working people who are building socialism and communism, it is very important to master modern scientific and cultural knowledge. Lenin made extremely profound remarks on this issue. He said, "Illiterate people cannot realize electrification, and it is not enough to be literate; they must also understand how to technically apply electricity to industry and agriculture, to all sectors of industry and agriculture. ... Only with modern education can they build a communist society; without such education, communism will remain only a wish." Therefore, while eliminating illiteracy and gradually popularizing primary amateur education, it is also necessary to launch a mass campaign for amateur universities and secondary specialized schools so that the working people can master modern knowledge. At present, about 25% of the workers across the country have reached junior high school level or above. Many modern factories and mines recruit all new workers with primary or junior high school education. In rural areas, many farmers have reached primary and junior high school levels through amateur learning. These workers and peasants with primary and secondary education demand to learn higher cultural and scientific knowledge. At present, many factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes have put forward many major scientific and technological problems in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. To solve these problems, it is necessary to have a corresponding level of scientific and technological expertise. We must also foresee that in the next two or three years, industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes will basically complete the task of eliminating illiteracy. In the process of gradually reducing illiteracy, an even greater number of primary and secondary amateur schools will inevitably be established, which urgently requires the establishment of amateur universities and secondary specialized schools to prepare sufficient teachers for these primary and secondary amateur schools. Under these circumstances, failure to establish amateur universities and secondary specialized schools in a timely manner will lag behind the development of the situation. It is very beneficial to the country's construction to conduct amateur education for cadres to further improve their political, cultural, and scientific and technological levels and to improve their professional competence and leadership skills. Therefore, all localities must also run amateur education for cadres well, mainly amateur universities and secondary specialized schools.

    Our amateur education serves proletarian politics. In amateur learning, the working people not only learn culture and technology, but also study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works to universally improve their communist consciousness. Our amateur education is combined with productive labor. It is clear that amateur education should improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of workers and peasants, but the purpose of improving the knowledge level of workers and peasants is to solve practical problems in production. Therefore, whether it is amateur schools run by factories, enterprises, or people's communes, the principle of education serving production must be implemented in the arrangement of time, teaching content, and teaching methods. Only in this way can amateur education be better sustained. Of course, all of this requires strengthening leadership and adhering to the principle of putting politics in command. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council recently decided to establish an Amateur Education Committee as an organization to guide amateur education throughout the country. We believe that this measure will play a major role in the large-scale development of amateur education work throughout the country. All factories, mines, enterprises, scientific research institutions, organizations, groups, the military, people's communes, and urban streets throughout the country must complete the task of cultivating talents while completing the country's production tasks and work tasks. In addition to running full-time and part-time schools, it is necessary to launch a mass campaign for amateur schools at all levels.

    Amateur education is a long-term and glorious task. In the past struggles of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, our Party has always attached importance to the amateur learning of workers and peasants, creating and accumulating rich experiences unprecedented in the history of education. Today, amateur education throughout the country should continue to leap forward on the basis of existing achievements, striving to gradually complete the historical mission of cultural revolution among hundreds of millions of people in a not-too-long historical period and realize Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction to make our people appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture.

### 全民大办业余教育

    全民大办业余教育
    大跃进以来，我国业余教育有了很大的发展。据1959年底的统计，全国已有一亿多人参加扫除文盲和各级业余学校学习。两年来扫除文盲七千多万人，大大超过第二个五年计划的预期要求。全国职工参加各级各类业余学校学习的有一千七百万人，其中参加业余高等学校学习的，已有十七万人。在农村中，参加业余中等学校学习的也有四百四十多万人。工农群众参加业余学习的规模是前所未有的。
    在发展全日制、半日制的教育的同时，全民大办业余教育，是党的“两条腿走路”的办学方针的体现。社会主义的教育事业是统一性与多样性相结合的。社会主义教育的目的，是培养有社会主义和共产主义觉悟的劳动者。这个全国统一的根本原则，就是社会主义教育的统一性。在这个统一的原则下，办学的形式是多样性的，即国家办学与厂矿、企业、人民公社办学并举，成人教育与儿童教育并举，免费的教育与不免费的教育并举，等等。学校的形式也是多样性的，有全日制学校，有半日制学校，也有业余学校。办学的多样性，办学的“两条腿走路”的办法是使广大人民得到充分学习条件的多快好省的办法。
    有计划、有领导地进行全民性的业余教育，是我们教育事业的一个重要方面，它继承和发挥了老解放区的办学传统，是实现劳动人民知识化的必要条件。广大工农群众担负着紧张的生产任务，不可能长期离开生产专门去学习。大办业余教育，就可以使广大工农群众一面生产，一面学习，把生产和教育密切结合起来。
    大办业余教育事业，是进行技术革命和文化革命所需要的，是以最快的速度培养出一支又红又专的工人阶级知识分子队伍所必需的。还要看到，我们最终的奋斗目标是实现共产主义。因此，在社会主义建设过程中，不但要高速度地发展生产，使物质产品得到极大的丰富；还要逐步缩小工农的差别、城乡的差别以及脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。所以，大办业余教育，不仅是当前生产和社会主义建设所需要的，也是将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义所必需的。业余教育今后的工作将更为繁重。我国将有几亿青年和成年的劳动人民（包括干部），从业余教育中逐步提高自己的政治、技术和文化水平。这是一件大事。在目前的形势下，我们要一面大力扫除剩余的文盲，尽可能及时地普及业余初等教育；一面大办业余高等教育和中等专业教育。
    文盲是对不识字的人的一种称呼。不识字的人必须进行识字学习，不做文盲。在广泛开展业余教育工作中，坚决扫除文盲，应当是一个出发点。如果不完成扫除文盲的任务，各级业余学校就不可能充分地发展，在劳动人民中普及教育也就无从谈起。目前全国农民参加扫除文盲学习的约六千五百多万人。在工人当中，文盲数量比较少，文盲半文盲由解放初期的80％降到20％左右，其中邮电系统已经下降到1．5％。这个情况说明，我们过去扫除文盲取得了极大的成就，但是，文盲仍然没有完全扫除，还有一定的数量。因此还必须把扫盲工作坚持到底。必须估计到，当前扫除文盲的任务可能更艰巨些。因为，一般地说，条件好的地区，早已扫除了。容易坚持学习的不识字的人，也早就脱掉了文盲的帽子。只有条件比较差的地区，以及某些坚持学习有困难的人，才留下空白。正因为如此，我们必须认真抓紧扫盲的扫尾工作。对于已经参加识字学习的人，一定要使他们坚持学习下去，直到摘掉文盲的帽子。对于那些应该参加和能够参加识字学习而现在还没有参加的人，应该尽可能地组织他们参加学习。各地对于已经扫除了文盲的人，要组织他们及时地进入业余初等学校学习。大力发展业余初等学校，一方面可以巩固扫除文盲成果，一方面可以继续提高劳动人民的政治、文化、技术水平。对于那些过去已经摆脱文盲状态，而现在又未参加业余初等学校的青壮年，应当尽先组织他们到业余初等学校去学习。今后扫除一批文盲，就要接着办起一批业余初等学校，把普及业余初等教育和扫除文盲两个环节密切衔接起来。
    扫除文盲，完成识字学习，仅仅是掌握文字工具的开始，而初等业余教育，也只是扫除文盲阶段的继续。如果认为到此就差不多，那是不对的。对于建设社会主义和共产主义的劳动人民来说，掌握现代科学文化知识是非常重要的。关于这个问题，列宁作了极为深刻的论述。他说，“不识字的人不能实现电气化，而且，仅仅识字还不够，还应该懂得怎样在技术上把电气应用到工农业上去，应用到工农业的各个部门中去。……只有受了现代教育，他们才能建立共产主义社会，如果不受这样的教育，共产主义仍然不过是一种愿望而已。”所以，在扫除文盲和逐步普及业余初级教育的同时，还必须大办业余高等学校和业余中等专业学校，使劳动人民掌握现代知识。现在全国职工中约有25％以上达到了初中以上水平。不少现代化的工厂矿山，全部招收的新工人都具有小学或初中的文化水平。在农村中，经过业余学习，也有许多农民达到小学和初中水平。这些有了初等和中等文化水平的工人、农民，就要求学习更高的文化科学知识。现在许多厂矿企业和人民公社里的技术革新和技术革命运动提出了很多重大的科学技术问题，要解决这些问题，必须具有相应的科学技术水平。我们还必须预见到，在今后两三年内，工矿企业和人民公社就要基本完成扫除文盲的任务。在文盲逐渐减少过程中，必将兴办数量更为巨大的初等和中等业余学校，这就迫切需要举办业余高等学校和业余中等专业学校，为这些初等和中等的业余学校准备足够的师资。在这些情况下，如果不及时举办业余高等学校和业余中等专业学校，就会落后于形势的发展。举办干部业余教育，进一步提高干部的政治、文化和科学技术水平，提高他们的业务能力和领导水平，对国家的建设来说，有很大好处。因此，各地也必须把干部业余教育，主要是业余高等学校和业余中等专业学校办好。
    我们的业余教育是为无产阶级政治服务的。劳动人民在业余学习中，不仅学文化，学技术，还要学马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，普遍提高自己的共产主义觉悟。我们的业余教育是同生产劳动相结合的。很明显，业余教育固然要提高工人农民的文化科学知识，但是，提高工农知识水平的目的是为了解决生产中的实际问题。因此，无论工厂、企业，或者人民公社所办的业余学校，在时间安排上，在教学内容和教学方法上，都要贯彻教育为生产服务的方针。只有这样，才能把业余教育更好地坚持下去。当然，这一切，都须要加强领导，坚持政治挂帅。中共中央和国务院最近决定成立业余教育委员会，作为指导全国业余教育的机关。我们相信，这一措施将对全国业余教育工作的巨大规模的发展起重大作用。全国一切厂矿、企业、科学研究机构、机关团体、军队、人民公社、城市街道，都要在完成国家的生产任务和工作任务的同时，完成培养人材的任务。除了举办全日制、半日制的学校外，必须大办各级业余学校。
    业余教育是一个长期的光荣的任务。我们党在过去民主革命和社会主义革命的斗争中，一直重视工农群众的业余学习，创造和积累了教育史上前所未有的丰富经验。今天，全国业余教育应当在已有的成就的基础上继续飞跃前进，争取在不太长的历史时期内，在几亿人口中，逐步完成文化革命的历史使命，实现毛泽东同志的预言，使我国人民作为一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。
