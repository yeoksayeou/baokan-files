Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Eighty thousand spectators in the capital, enjoying their Sunday holiday, watched the friendly match between the Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team and the Chinese Youth Football Team First Team this afternoon at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The visiting team won 2-1. The score at halftime was 0-0.

Both sides adjusted their lineups in the second half. The home team's right winger, Cong Zheyu, was replaced by newcomer Sun Yunshan. At this point, the five forwards from right to left became: Chen Jialiang, Zhang Honggen, Nian Weisi, Sun Yunshan, and Sun Yuanyun. The visiting team replaced center forward Rabtov with meritorious athlete Salnikov. This experienced player had a strong ability to control the ball. He became the visiting team's offensive organizer, often active near midfield. After getting the ball, he could often create favorable shooting opportunities for the other forwards on the visiting team.

In the first few minutes of the match, the home team's offense was very strong. In the second minute, Nian Weisi's powerful shot in the penalty area almost went into the goal guarded by Ivakin. However, when the match reached the fourteenth minute, the visiting team took advantage of the home team's all-out attack and successfully launched a quick counterattack. Right inside forward Grekov dribbled straight into the home team's penalty area. When the home team's left back, Wang Kebin, rushed in from behind, the ball had already been transferred to the left, and the visiting team's left winger, V. Mishin, scored with a powerful shot from a dozen meters away. Thirteen minutes later, the visiting team's right inside forward, Mozer, headed in another goal from almost the same spot. The visiting team led 2-0.

After conceding two goals in a row, the home team was not discouraged and launched several fierce counterattacks. They finally scored a goal with only one minute left in the match, changing the score to 2-1.

The Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team has concluded its visit and matches in our country. They will leave Beijing on the 29th to return home.

Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: The Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team achieved its fifth victory in the friendly matches during their visit to China on the afternoon of the 26th. They defeated the joint team of the Chinese Locomotive Sports Association football team and the First Machine Sports Association football team 3-1 in a friendly match at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The two sides tied 1-1 in the first half.

Shortly after the start of the match, the visiting team gained the advantage with continuous fierce attacks. Within less than a quarter of an hour, they launched six powerful shots, forcing the home team's goalkeeper, Li Xuezhu, to repeatedly save the ball. Finally, in the fourteenth minute, left inside forward Kharmogolov scored a goal in the penalty area.

After that, the game turned into a back-and-forth battle. In the nineteenth minute, the home team replaced goalkeeper Li Xuezhu with Liu Guobin and launched continuous attacks. By the thirty-fourth minute, the most intense scramble appeared in front of the visiting team's goal. The United Team's forwards attacked four times in a row within one minute. The first three shots were blocked by the crowd, but the last time, the visiting team's right back, Kubchek, committed a handball foul in front of the goal. When the United Team took the eleven-meter penalty, left inside forward Cui Changyun took a fierce kick, causing the visiting team's goalkeeper, Ivanov, to lose the goal. The score became 1-1.

An unpredictable situation occurred in the second half. Less than half a minute after the kickoff in midfield, the visiting team unexpectedly shot the ball into the United Team's goal in front of the penalty area with only one pass by the young center forward, Leingold. This "lightning" attack won warm applause from tens of thousands of spectators.

After conceding a goal, the United Team tried hard to counterattack, but later, due to physical decline, the speed of the attack gradually slowed down. When the match reached the twenty-seventh minute, left inside forward Kharmogolov scored another goal for the visiting team, making the score 3-1.

    “斯巴达克”队在京最后两场比赛
    二比一胜中国青年队，三比一胜火车头、一机联队
    据新华社27日讯　八万名欢度星期假日的首都观众，今天下午在北京工人体育场观看了苏联莫斯科“斯巴达克”足球队同中国青年足球队第一队的友谊比赛。结果客队以二比一取胜。上半场的比数是零比零。
    下半场双方都调整了阵容。主队右边锋从者余下场，上场的是新手孙云山。这时五个前锋从右到左的顺序变成：陈家亮、张宏根、年维泗、孙云山、孙元云。客队则由功勋运动员萨尔尼科夫替下中锋拉布托夫。这位有经验的选手控制球能力很强，他成了客队的进攻组织者，多在中场附近活动，得到球后经常能恰到好处地为客队其他前锋创造有利的射门机会。
    比赛的头几分钟主队进攻很猛，第二分钟时年维泗在禁区内的一次劲射险些踢进伊瓦金把守的球门。但当比赛进行到第十四分钟时，客队乘主队全力进攻后方空虚的机会，成功地展开了一次快速反击。右内锋格列柯夫带球长驱直入主队禁区，主队左后卫王克斌从后面赶来时，球已转移到左方，客队左边锋维·米辛在十几米外一脚劲射，就踢入了球门。过了十三分钟，客队右内锋莫泽尔又在几乎是同一个地方用头顶入一球。客队以二比零领先。
    主队连续失球后并没气馁，多次展开猛烈反攻。他们终于在比赛还剩最后一分钟时攻入一球，使纪录变成二比一。
    苏联莫斯科“斯巴达克”足球队已经结束了在我国的访问比赛。他们将在29日离北京回国。
    据新华社26日讯　苏联莫斯科“斯巴达克”足球队26日下午取得了访华友谊比赛的第五次胜利，他们在北京工人体育场同中国火车头体育协会足球队、第一机械体育协会足球队联队举行友谊比赛时，以三比一获胜。上半时双方踢成一平。
    比赛开始不久，客队就取得了连续猛攻的优势，在不到一刻钟内，就进行了六次强有力的射门，使主队守门员李学洙反复扑救，应接不暇，终于在第十四分钟时，由左内锋哈尔莫戈洛夫在禁区内射入了一球。
    以后，场上形成了拉锯战。十九分钟时，主队由刘国斌换下守门员李学洙，并且连续发动攻势。到三十四分钟时，客队球门前出现了最紧张的争夺场面。联队前锋在一分钟内连续四次攻门，前三次球都被人丛挡出，但最后一次由于客队右后卫库布契克在球门前用手接球犯规，联队罚十一米球时，左内锋崔长允猛踢一脚使客队守门员伊万诺夫失守。场上纪录变成一平。
    下半时的比赛出现了难以预料的情况。在中场开球后不到半分钟，客队只经过一次传递就由年轻的中锋莱因戈尔特在禁区前出其不意地将球射入了联队的球门。这种“闪电”般的攻势博得了数万观众的热烈鼓掌声。
    联队失球后努力反攻，但后来由于体力减弱，进攻的速度逐渐缓慢下来，当比赛进行到第二十七分钟时，又被客队左内锋哈尔莫戈洛夫攻进一球，形成三比一的局面。
