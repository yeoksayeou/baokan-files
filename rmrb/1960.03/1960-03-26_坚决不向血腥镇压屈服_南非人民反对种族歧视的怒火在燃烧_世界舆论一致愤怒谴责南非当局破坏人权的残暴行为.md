    The South African people, disregarding the bloody suppression by the South African authorities, continue to wage a heroic struggle against racial discrimination.
    According to Johannesburg reports, the African National Congress of South Africa has called on African workers in South Africa to hold a nationwide strike on Monday to protest the atrocities of the South African authorities. Albert Luthuli, President of the African National Congress, demanded that all African men, women, and children stay in their homes on the 28th to mourn the victims massacred by the South African authorities on the 21st.
    According to an Associated Press report, "an unprecedented paralysis in the making" has engulfed Meyerton, a major industrial city thirty miles south of Johannesburg. "Furious Africans refused to go to work, and the number of strikers was so large that some factories closed completely, while others tried to continue operating with only white staff."
    A new struggle against racial discrimination has erupted in Nyanga, a large black residential area near Cape Town. Africans erected barricades made of old cars and oil drums in the streets and threw stones at police vehicles.
    On the 24th, approximately ninety Africans held a demonstration in front of the Cape Town Police Headquarters and refused to carry "passes" designed to restrict their movement.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cape Town, March 25th: Disregarding the strong protests and condemnations of the African people and the people of the world, the South African Federal Government is still ruthlessly employing various despicable means to brutally suppress the African people's just struggle against the "Pass Laws."
    On the 24th, South African Minister of Justice Erasmus announced a ban prohibiting public gatherings in all major cities and most towns in South Africa until June 30th.
    On the 25th, he also informed the South African Parliament that he would submit a bill on the 28th authorizing the Governor-General to declare the African National Congress of South Africa, the Pan-Africanist Congress, and other African organizations illegal.
    The Speaker of the House of Assembly also announced that on March 28th, the House would give priority to discussing Erasmus's proposal.
    At the same time, the South African government authorities are also conducting searches of the offices and homes of members of the African National Congress and other organizations throughout the country and arresting its members.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 24th: Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to the Prime Minister of the South African Federation on the 23rd, expressing anger and condemnation at the criminal acts of the South African Federal authorities in the bloody suppression of the South African people. The telegram also strongly condemned the barbaric apartheid policy implemented by the South African Federal Government.
    In the telegram, Saillant also expressed, on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions, sympathy to the families of those who suffered in the bloody suppression by the South African Federal authorities and reiterated that the World Federation of Trade Unions fully supports and supports the African workers who are fighting against racial discrimination.
    Xinhua News Agency: TASS was authorized to issue a statement on the 24th saying that the Soviet public was deeply indignant and unanimously condemned the South African Federation's gross violation of universally recognized human rights after learning of the brutal massacre of innocent people in the South African Federation for fighting for their legitimate rights.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: Governments, political parties, and public opinion in some African and Asian countries, as well as trade union organizations in Australia, have protested and condemned the atrocities of the South African Federal authorities in massacring African people, and expressed their support for the South African people's struggle for freedom and against racial discrimination.
    The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a statement on the 24th, expressing great shock at the South African authorities' acts of massacre. The statement called on the people and governments of all African countries to take effective measures to stop the barbaric acts of racists and get rid of the shackles of imperialism.
    On the same day, the Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said in a communique that the Ghanaian government was "shocked" by the massacre of South African Africans.
    Kenyan nationalist leader Mboya sent a telegram to South African Prime Minister Verwoerd protesting the South African authorities' policy of massacre.
    The Indian National Congress issued a statement on the 24th condemning the South African government's "wanton and brutal massacre." On the same day, the Secretary-General of the People's Progressive Party of Malaya, S. P. Seenivasagam, suggested in a speech that the Federation government should immediately ban the import of South African goods.
    Australian Council of Trade Unions President Monk told the press that he would ask the Australian people to boycott South African goods.
