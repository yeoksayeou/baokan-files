Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The first group of over 2,100 repatriated overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia on ships sent by the motherland have all been properly resettled and began taking up new positions successively from the 6th. Among them, more than 1,000 people who went to overseas Chinese farms in Hainan Island, Lufeng, and Huaxian to participate in production have already departed successively on the 6th. More than 900 people who went to the Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School in Fujian for study and to the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm in Fujian, the Beikeng Overseas Chinese Tea and Fruit Farm in Yongchun, and other industrial and mining enterprises for work, left by special train on the 7th. Some elderly and helpless repatriates are prepared to be placed in the Taishan Overseas Chinese Nursing Home for the elderly. Repatriates who wish to return to their hometowns have been helped by the government to return and reunite with their families.

These overseas Chinese who were forced to return home during the anti-Chinese movement by powerful groups in Indonesia have all gratefully accepted the motherland's arrangements with immense gratitude. Many have expressed their determination to repay the motherland's concern for them with practical actions to improve production and learning. Wu Wensong, Guo Chaogui, Lai Jiulun, and Lan Dianzhang, who returned from Lianwang, Indonesia, excitedly wrote down their determination: "Obey the motherland's assignment, determined to contribute our strength to the motherland to repay the kindness bestowed upon us by the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the motherland." Of the 182 repatriates who went to the Beikeng Overseas Chinese Tea and Fruit Farm in Yongchun, Fujian, many were originally residents of mountainous areas in eastern Guangdong and southern Fujian before going abroad. After arriving in Indonesia, they planted potatoes, pepper, and other crops in the mountainous area near Yali. After learning that they were assigned to the tea and fruit farm, many expressed their intention to dedicate their skills to the motherland and develop the motherland's tea and fruit mountains well. A group of overseas Chinese who returned from Zibennei, Zhanyu, Xinchong Laiye, and other places in Indonesia eagerly hoped to go to Hainan Island to plant subtropical crops. The government satisfied their request and assigned them to the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in Hainan Island to participate in production, which made them very happy. The more than 90 repatriates who were resettled at the Huaxian Overseas Chinese Farm all returned from Zhibade. They traveled on the same boat when they returned and lived in the same dormitory after returning to China. Due to mutual care and assistance in life, they have established a deep friendship. When they learned that they would be working together on the same farm in the future, everyone was happy and told each other, encouraging each other to be more united and help each other after arriving at the farm, to humbly learn production skills from the old farm members, and to work together with the old farm members to improve the farm's production.

The repatriated students also happily took up their learning posts. More than 50 middle and primary school students who returned from Zhimawei said after learning that they were assigned to the Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School in Fujian: The motherland has such beautiful mountains and rivers, and the Party and the People's Government are so infinitely concerned about us. It is the same to learn skills wherever we study. Wu Shuzhen and Wu Xuezhen, two sisters who were studying at the Wanlong Overseas Chinese Middle School, knew about the happy learning life at Jimei School from their brother's letter before returning to China. Now that they have been assigned there, the two sisters are very happy and expressed their intention to study hard and strive to be "five-good" students to repay the care and expectations of the motherland and their relatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 10th: More than 800 repatriated overseas Chinese who arrived in Xiamen on March 6th have praised the motherland's rapid construction and the completely new look of society.

Ma Yin, an 85-year-old mother and repatriated overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said with emotion when talking about the new look of her hometown after liberation: "This time I returned to China, I saw that everyone in the motherland was wearing clean clothes, everyone had a job to do, and had food to eat. Wherever I went, I didn't see a single vagrant child begging for food. The new China has only been established for a few years, and it is not easy for so many people to have enough to wear and eat!" When talking about his impressions of returning to China, the repatriate Li Yapu praised the great leap forward in agricultural production in the motherland. He said: Agricultural production has developed amazingly since liberation. From Guangzhou to Fujian, the fields were full of lush crops all the way, and the reclaimed mountains were planted with large areas of fruit trees and trees. All the land that could be used was not left idle. He said: "I remember that in the old society, seedlings could only be seen in March. This time I arrived in Guangzhou, it was only the end of the first month of the lunar calendar, and the rice fields were already green. Entering Fujian, the seedlings were already more than two inches tall!" Li Yapu heard that there has been a recent spring drought in southern Fujian. He saw farmers diverting water from the newly built reservoirs to irrigate the farmland and said happily: "Even if there is a drought, spring plowing can continue. This is a miracle created by the People's Government leading farmers to build water conservancy projects!"

The repatriated overseas Chinese praised the fact that the motherland's transportation is accessible in all directions after liberation. The repatriate Chen Mei saw that the Jimei and Gaoqi seawalls connecting the mainland of Xiamen have been built, and the newly built Ji (mei) Guan (kou) highway is wide and flat. She said to the repatriates: "In the past, Xiamen and Jimei were separated by a strait, and there was no highway from Guankou to Jimei. It would take my family more than half a day to visit my daughter who was studying in Jimei. Nowadays, trains and buses go directly there, making it convenient to go out!" After returning to China, this group of repatriated overseas Chinese saw new factories everywhere in the cities and large chimneys erected in the vast countryside. They were extremely excited. Mai Hanbing, a repatriated overseas Chinese from Indonesia, visited the textile factory in the Xinglin Industrial Zone of Xiamen. He saw a cotton gin manufactured by the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory and spinning machines and roving frames produced in Shanghai and Qingdao. He proudly gave a thumbs up and said: "The motherland! It's really great!"

    新华社讯　从印度尼西亚乘祖国派出的第一批轮船回国的二千一百多名归侨，已经全部得到妥善安置，并从6日开始陆续走上新的岗位。其中到海南岛、陆丰、花县等华侨农场参加生产的有一千多人，已经在6日先后出发。到福建集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习和到福建常山华侨农场、永春北硿华侨茶果场和其他工矿企业中工作的有九百多人，在7日乘专车前往。一些年老无靠的归侨，准备安置在台山华侨敬老院养老。愿意回乡的归侨，已由政府帮助回乡同家人团聚。
    这些在印度尼西亚有势力集团排华运动中被迫回国的侨胞们，都怀着对祖国无比感激的心情，愉快地接受祖国的分配。很多人都表示今后一定要以搞好生产和学习的实际行动来报答祖国对他们的关怀。从印度尼西亚连旺回来的吴文崧、郭朝贵、赖九伦和蓝典章等四个人，激动地写下了他们的决心：“服从祖国分配，决心把自己的力量贡献给祖国，来报答党、毛主席和祖国人民给予我们的恩惠。”到福建永春北硿华侨茶果场的一百八十二名侨胞，许多人出国前原是粤东和闽南一带山区的居民，到了印度尼西亚后，在牙律附近的山区种植马铃薯、胡椒等作物。他们知道被分配到茶果场后，许多人都表示要把技术献给祖国，一定要开发好祖国的茶果山。一批从印度尼西亚芝本内、展玉、新崇赖野等地回来的华侨，热望到海南岛去种植亚热带作物，政府满足了他们的要求，分配他们到海南岛兴隆华侨农场参加生产，他们十分高兴。被安置到花县华侨农场去的九十多名归侨，都是从芝巴德回来的，他们回来时同坐一条船，回国后又同住在一个宿舍里。由于生活上的互相照顾、互相帮助，他们已经建立了深厚的友谊。当他们知道今后又同在一个农场里劳动后，大家高兴得奔走相告，并互相勉励今后到了农场要更加团结互助，虚心向老场员学习生产技能，同老场员们一起共同搞好农场的生产。
    归侨学生也愉快地走上他们的学习岗位。从芝马圩回来的五十多名中、小学生，知道分配他们到福建集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习后，他们说：祖国有如此美丽的山河，党和人民政府对我们又是无比的关怀，到哪里读书都一样学到本领。原在万隆华侨中学念书的吴淑珍和吴雪珍两姊妹，回国前就从哥哥的信中知道集美学校幸福的学习生活。现在把她们分配到那里，姊妹俩十分高兴，表示要积极学习，争取作一个“五好”学生，来报答祖国和亲人们对她们的关怀和期望。
    新华社厦门10日电　3月6日到达厦门的八百多名归国华侨，纷纷赞扬祖国建设一日千里，社会面貌焕然一新。
    八十五岁的老妈妈、印度尼西亚归侨马银，她谈到解放后的家乡新貌时，感动得说：“我这次回国，看见祖国人人穿着洁净的衣服，人人有工作做，有饭吃，所到之处，没有看到一个行乞讨饭的流浪儿。新中国成立没有几年，这样众多的人口，人人衣温食饱，真不简单啊！”归侨李亚蒲谈到回国的观感时，赞不绝口地歌颂祖国农业生产大跃进。他说：解放后的农业生产，发展得很惊人，从广州到福建，一路上耕田都长着茂盛的作物，经过垦荒的一个个山头，种着大片果树和树木，凡是能够用的土地，都没有空闲着。他说：“记得在旧社会，3月里才能看到秧苗，这次到达广州，农历才元月底，秧田已一片青绿了；进入福建，秧苗已长二寸多高了！”李亚蒲听说福建南部最近春旱，他看见农民们从新建的水库中引水灌溉农田，高兴地说：“受旱也能继续春耕，这是人民政府领导农民大兴水利创造的奇迹！”
    归侨们看到解放后祖国交通四通八达，赞不绝口。归侨陈妹看到连接大陆的厦门的集美、高崎海堤已修建起来，新建的集（美）、灌（口）公路又宽又平坦，对归侨们说：“从前呀，厦门和集美隔着一个海峡，灌口到集美也没有公路，我那在集美读书的女儿，家里人要去看她，得花大半天时间。当今，火车、汽车直通，出门可方便哩！”这批归侨回国后，看见城市里到处是新工厂，广大农村竖起一根根大烟囱，兴奋异常。印度尼西亚归侨麦寒冰，参观厦门杏林工业区纺织厂，看见厂里有郑州纺织机械厂制造的弹棉机，由上海、青岛出产的细纱机和粗纱机，翘起大拇指自豪地说：“祖国！真是伟大！”
