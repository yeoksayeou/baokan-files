Xinhua News Agency, March 1st—Throughout the rural areas of the country, women have played the role of the main force on the agricultural production front, making significant contributions to the continued great leap forward in agriculture in 1959.

Last year, the number of women attending work in rural areas frequently reached over 90% of the total female labor force, with some areas reaching 95%. All women participating in labor mastered and improved their agricultural skills, and in some areas, approximately 30% to 40% of women mastered key techniques, becoming "all-rounders" in agricultural production. In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, in 1958, only a few women knew how to plow, but by last year, it became a common phenomenon. In Hubei Province, 1.4 million women became experts in plowing, tilling, and deep plowing; in Zhejiang Province, 1.56 million women became experts in rice transplanting; and in Fujian Province, over 500,000 women became "all-rounders" in agricultural production. Activities such as operating seed drills, winnowing, and driving carts, which were traditionally done by male commune members, were also learned and mastered by women in many places last year. Many women also learned to use new agricultural tools such as harvesters, seeders, and tractors. According to statistics from eighteen counties in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, female tractor drivers accounted for 42.6% of the total number of tractor drivers. In Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, women could only do thirty-two kinds of simple farm work in 1957. In 1958, they learned seventy-eight kinds of farm work, including driving tractors, and by 1959, they had increased to eighty-two kinds of farm work.

The improvement of rural women's production skills and the expansion of their labor scope has made their role in agricultural production and construction increasingly significant. Currently, in many areas, women have played a major role in wheat and cotton field management, fertilizer accumulation, and sowing and harvesting. The number of women participating in fertilizer accumulation generally reaches over 90% of the female labor force in various regions, accounting for over 45% of the total male and female fertilizer accumulation labor force. Many areas have also established women's chemical fertilizer factories. The broad masses of women have also made significant contributions to water conservancy construction and overcoming natural disasters. According to statistics from fourteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, and Beijing, over 21 million women participated in water conservancy construction last year. Last year, many provinces and regions suffered from severe droughts unseen in decades. The broad masses of women were in high spirits in the fight against drought. They actively participated in activities such as fetching water, diverting water for irrigation, and repairing canals, and made every effort to find water sources to expand the irrigated area. In Changge, Yancheng, and four other counties in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, 520,000 women organized more than 4,600 anti-drought shock teams named after Hua Mulan and Liu Hulan, irrigating over 550,000 mu of land in three days. In this way, the broad masses of rural women, through their hard work, worked with the male commune members to overcome natural disasters and preserve the harvest.

In order to learn advanced agricultural techniques, many rural women in various regions also planted a large number of high-yield experimental fields last year. According to statistics from six provinces, including Hubei, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, and Liaoning, over 10 million women participated in planting high-yield experimental fields, totaling over 28 million mu. The broad masses of women carefully cultivated and boldly experimented in the process of planting experimental fields, just like embroidery, so their experimental fields generally achieved high yields. The high-yield fields planted by women in Sichuan Province were generally about 20% higher than the local average yield. The cotton experimental fields planted by women in Shaanxi Province had over 1,360 mu with a yield of over 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 2.58 million mu of early rice, late rice, late autumn crops, and spring flower experimental fields planted by rural women in Zhejiang Province last year, after inspection, included over 5,180 mu of early rice with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, and over 26,400 mu of late rice with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu.

While ensuring the high-speed development of grain and cotton production, the broad masses of rural women have also made significant contributions to forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production. In Hebei Province last year, over 4.3 million women participated in afforestation, planting over 8.69 million mu of trees alone, and over 100 million scattered trees. The area afforested by women in eight counties, including Yan'an in Shaanxi Province, last spring accounted for 70% of the total area. In animal husbandry production, with pig raising as the priority, women are a major force. According to preliminary statistics from three provinces and regions, including Guangxi, Shandong, and Hebei, and four prefectures, including Luoyang in Henan, Fuyang in Anhui, Wenzhou in Zhejiang, and Hanzhong in Shaanxi, there are over 60,000 women's pig farms and over 540,000 female breeders. In Hebei Province, over 1.7 million women participated in sideline production, accounting for over 60% of the total number of participants in sideline production, operating over 100 kinds of projects. Last year, women in Shanxi Province earned over 73 million yuan from sideline production, accounting for 20.62% of the total income. Women in coastal areas such as Liaoning and Zhejiang Provinces actively participated in fishery production. In the Zhoushan area of Zhejiang Province, women broke the old custom of historically never allowing women to go on fishing boats. Last year, over 7,700 women went to sea to fish, and nearly 100 women trained to become outstanding boat captains and engine operators.

Party organizations at all levels have continuously strengthened their leadership over the women's mass movement, caring for, cultivating, and educating them in many aspects, including political ideology, production technology, and life. The development and consolidation of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens and childcare organizations after the rural people's communes were established has enabled the broad masses of rural women to engage in agricultural production with peace of mind. These are the main reasons for the major achievements of the broad masses of rural women in participating in production. Last year, Party organizations at all levels led rural women to widely carry out women's mass movements such as "Skillful Girls," "Female Experts," "Million Red Banner Bearers," and "Red, Diligent, and Skillful." Through these mass competition movements, the collectivist thinking of the broad masses of women has been greatly promoted, and their enthusiasm for labor has been further increased.

Currently, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of rural women continue to hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, determined to continuously improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, and, together with all male commune members, contribute even greater strength to striving to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture this year and to realize agricultural modernization as soon as possible.

    妇女力量大无边　顶住生产半个天
    农村姊妹跃为生产主力军
    许多妇女学会了各种农活技术成为“全把式”
    新华社1日讯　全国各地农村妇女在农业生产战线上发挥了主力军的作用，为1959年农业继续大跃进作出了重大贡献。
    去年各地农村妇女出勤人数，经常达到妇女劳力总数的90％以上，不少地区达到95％。所有参加劳动的妇女都掌握和提高了农活技术，有些地区约有30％到40％的妇女掌握了关键性技术，成了农业生产中的“全把式”。宁夏回族自治区1958年会犁地的妇女还只是少数，到去年就成为普遍现象。湖北省有一百四十万妇女成为犁田、整地和深耕的能手，浙江省有一百五十六万妇女成为插秧能手，福建省有五十多万妇女成为农业生产中的“全把式”。摇耧、扬场、赶大车等一向为男社员干的活，去年也有不少地方妇女学会掌握。许多妇女还学会使用收割机、播种机、拖拉机等新式农具。据新疆维吾尔自治区十八个县统计，女拖拉机手占当地拖拉机手总数的42．6％。黑龙江省拜泉县兴农人民公社的妇女，1957年只能做三十二种简单农活，1958年她们就学会了开拖拉机等七十八种农活，到1959年又增加到八十二种农活。
    农村妇女生产技术的提高和劳动范围的扩大，就使她们在农业生产建设中的作用日益显著。目前，许多地区在麦田和棉田管理、积肥、播种收割等方面，妇女都起了主力军的作用。妇女参加积肥的人数，各地一般都达到妇女劳力的90％以上，占男女积肥劳力总数的45％以上。不少地区还建立了妇女化肥厂。广大妇女在兴修水利和战胜自然灾害方面也作出了重大贡献。据河北、山东、山西、甘肃、北京等十四个省、市统计，去年参加水利建设的妇女有二千一百多万人。去年许多省、区遭到了几十年来未有的严重干旱，广大妇女在抗旱斗争中斗志昂扬，她们积极参加取水、引水浇地和修整渠道等活动，并千方百计寻找水源扩大灌溉面积。河南省许昌专区的长葛、郾城等六个县，有五十二万妇女组织了四千六百多个花木兰、刘胡兰等抗旱突击队，三天内浇地五十五万多亩。广大农村妇女就这样用自己的辛勤劳动，和男社员一起战胜了自然灾害，保住了丰收。
    为了学习农业先进技术，许多地区的农村妇女去年还种了大量丰产试验田。据湖北、四川、河北、山东、福建、辽宁六个省统计，有一千多万妇女参加种丰产试验田，共种二千八百多万亩。广大妇女在种试验田过程中，都像绣花一样精心培育，大胆试验，因此她们的试验田都普遍获得了丰收。四川省妇女种的丰产田一般都高于当地平均产量20％左右。陕西省妇女种的棉花试验田，有一千三百六十多亩亩产籽棉千斤以上。浙江省农村妇女去年种的二百五十八万亩早稻、晚稻、晚秋作物和春花试验田，经过验收，其中早稻亩产千斤以上的有五千一百八十多亩，晚稻亩产千斤以上的二万六千四百多亩。
    广大农村妇女在保证粮棉生产高速度发展的同时，在林、牧、副、渔各业生产中也都作出了重大贡献。河北省去年有四百三十多万妇女参加植树造林，并单独种树八百六十九万多亩，零星植树一亿多株。陕西省延安等八个县妇女去年春季造林的面积，占总面积70％。在以养猪为首的畜牧业生产中，妇女是一支主要力量，仅据广西、山东、河北三个省、区及河南洛阳、安徽阜阳、浙江温州、陕西汉中四个专区的初步统计，就有妇女养猪场六万多个，女饲养员五十四万多人。河北省有一百七十多万妇女参加副业生产，占参加副业生产总人数的60％以上，经营的项目有一百多种。山西省妇女去年经营副业生产收入七千三百多万元，占总收入的20．62％。辽宁、浙江等省沿海地区的妇女积极参加了渔业生产。浙江省舟山地区妇女打破了历史上从来不许妇女下渔船的旧习惯，去年有七千七百多妇女下海捕鱼，并有近百名妇女锻炼成了出色的船老大和机轮手。
    各地党组织不断加强对妇女群众运动的领导，从政治思想上、生产技术上和生活上多方面对她们关心培养教育；农村人民公社化后公共食堂、托儿组织等集体福利事业的发展和巩固，使广大农村妇女安心从事农业生产，这些是广大农村妇女参加生产取得重大成绩的主要原因。去年各地党组织领导农村妇女广泛开展了“巧姑娘”、“女能手”、“百万红旗手”、“红、勤、巧”等妇女群众运动。通过这些群众竞赛运动，使广大妇女的集体主义思想大大发扬，劳动积极性更加高涨。
    目前，广大农村妇女在党的领导下，继续高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，立志要不断提高政治、文化和技术水平，同全体男社员一道，为争取实现今年农业大丰收，为尽快地实现农业现代化贡献更大的力量。
