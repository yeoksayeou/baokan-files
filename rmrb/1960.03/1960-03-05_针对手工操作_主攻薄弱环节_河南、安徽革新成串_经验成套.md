Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial and transportation fronts in Henan Province has further developed. From January to the present, workers have put forward a total of 1.2 million innovation proposals, realizing 450,000 of them, which has played a significant role in promoting the province's sustained leap forward in production. In January, the province's output of pig iron, raw coal, steel, steel products, power generation, and metal cutting machine tools all increased compared to December of last year; in the first twenty-five days of February, they increased even more compared to the same period last month.

Currently, the spearhead of this movement is directed towards the overall innovation of various industries. Enterprises with manual operations and outdated equipment are generally moving towards mechanization and semi-mechanization; modern enterprises with a high degree of mechanization and new technical equipment are advancing towards comprehensively improving the degree of mechanization and automation.

Constantly overcoming weak links in production, from low to high, from simple to complex, serial innovation, and complete sets of experience are the distinct characteristics of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Henan Province. The movement often focuses on breaking through a backward link, and then links tightly, causing a series of reforms and changes. The Luoyang First Tractor Factory, taking the 35 presses in the stamping workshop as the main force, achieved automatic material feeding and discharging in three days and nights, increasing work efficiency eightfold as a starting point, and immediately drove the automation of 179 machine tools and five production lines throughout the factory.

The situation of technical innovation in the coal industry is also higher than ever. Soon after the Jiaozuo Coal Mine successfully tested slag pillars, it successfully tested ceramic pillars with better performance and a wider range of raw material sources. Subsequently, lightweight concrete pillars and ceramic pillars from Hebi and Pingdingshan were also successively born.

The serialization and supporting of technical innovation in other industries have also had a huge impact on production. In the metallurgical industry, the small blast furnace began with the Xinxiang Second Iron and Steel Plant overcoming the four weak links of wind, temperature, furnace charge, and operation. It finally created a complete set of high-quality and high-yield experience such as multi-mouth low-position combustion, roasting ore, turning poor ore into rich ore, ore crushing, and mechanized furnace front plugging, making the province's small blast furnace production an emerging and excellent force in the country.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the millions of workers in factories and mines throughout the province have also greatly promoted the communist style, achieving a situation where one family leaps forward and hundreds of families catch up, and when one family is weak, hundreds of families assist.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Factories in Anhui Province are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and labor productivity is rapidly increasing. According to statistics for the most recent month, the province has saved more than 55,000 units of labor, and labor productivity has increased by 17% compared to December of last year. The total industrial output value has increased by 17.8% compared to December of last year.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, factories in Anhui Province first targeted the types of work and processes with heavy production tasks, high labor occupation, and a large proportion of manual operations, vigorously reforming tools and machinery and equipment, and advancing towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. Not only have various places reformed many heavy manual operation tools, implemented mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, but they have also created many advanced operation methods and multi-functional, high-efficiency tools, which have also played a significant role in reducing labor intensity and saving labor.

### 针对手工操作  主攻薄弱环节  河南、安徽革新成串　经验成套

    针对手工操作  主攻薄弱环节
    河南、安徽革新成串　经验成套
    据新华社郑州电　河南省工业、交通运输战线技术革新和技术革命运动进一步发展。从1月份到现在，职工们共提出革新建议一百二十万件，实现了四十五万件，对推动全省生产持续跃进起了很大的作用。1月份，全省生铁、原煤、钢、钢材、发电量、金属切削机床的产量，都比去年12月份有所增长；2月份头二十五天，又比上月同期增长许多。
    目前，这一运动的矛头正指向各行业的全盘革新。手工操作和设备陈旧的企业普遍向机械化、半机械化迈进；机械化程度高、技术装备新的现代化企业，正向全面提高机械化程度和自动化进军。
    不断克服生产薄弱环节，由低到高，由简到繁，革新成串，经验成套，是河南省当前技术革新和技术革命运动的鲜明特征。运动往往针对一个落后环节加以突破，接着就环环扣紧，引起一系列的改革和变化。洛阳第一拖拉机厂以冲压车间三十五台压床为主力，经过三昼夜实现了退料进料自动化，提高工效八倍为起点，马上带动全厂一百七十九台机床、五条生产流水线实现了自动化。
    煤炭工业技术革新的形势也是一浪高过一浪。焦作煤矿试验成功炉渣支柱不久，又试验成功了使用性能更加良好、原料来路更为广阔的陶粒支柱。接着，鹤壁、平顶山的轻质混凝土支柱和陶瓷支柱等，又相继诞生。
    其他各行业技术革新的系列化和配套，对生产也都发生了巨大影响。冶金工业中的小高炉从新乡第二钢铁厂克服风、温、炉料、操作四大薄弱环节开始，终于创造了多嘴低位置燃烧，焙烧矿石，变贫矿为富矿，矿石粉碎、炉前堵口机械化等一套完整的优质高产经验，使全省小高炉生产成为全国一支后起的优秀兵团。
    全省各厂矿的千百万职工，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，还大大发扬了共产主义风格，做到了一家跃进百家追赶，一家力薄，百家协助。
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省各工厂大搞技术革新和技术革命，劳动生产率迅速提高。据最近一个月统计，全省已节约劳动力五万五千多个，劳动生产率比去年12月提高17％。工业生产总产值比去年12月份提高17．8％。
    安徽省各工厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，首先针对生产任务重、占用劳力多、手工操作比重大的工种和工序，大搞工具和机器设备的改革，向机械化、半机械化进军。各地不仅改革了很多笨重的手工操作工具，实行了机械化半机械化操作，还创制了很多先进操作方法和多能的高工效工具，对于降低劳动强度、节约劳动力，也起了很大作用。
