    Xindu County, Guilin Commune:
    One Acre of Rapeseed, a Swarm of Bees

    This newspaper reports that a scene of bustling activity is now unfolding at the bee farm in Guilin Commune, Xindu County, Sichuan. The woodworking shop is busy rushing to make beehives, the honeycomb foundation factory is busy producing frames and royal jelly, and beekeepers are preemptively cultivating queen bees and expanding bee colonies. More than 7,000 beehives (including those from other places) have been placed near the rapeseed fields to collect flowers and make honey.
    This commune is rich in honey sources. In the spring months of February, rapeseed flowers bloom everywhere, making it an ideal place to develop beekeeping. In order to meet the even greater increase in rapeseed production this year, the bee farm has decided to increase the number of bee colonies sevenfold this year, based on last year's 2,453 colonies, achieving one swarm of bees per acre of rapeseed. This will increase the number of pods per rapeseed branch from 16 last year to 36, and the number of seeds per pod from 16 last year to more than 20, achieving pods full to the tip, plump seeds, eliminating empty grains, and achieving a bumper harvest. At the same time, it will increase honey production by five times from last year's 4,800 catties.
    In order to ensure that the queen bees are strong and lay many eggs, and to prepare conditions for egg laying and honey storage, the bee farm has produced a large number of royal jelly and frames, and has rushed to make more than 1,000 beehives, preparing for the continuous expansion of bee colonies.

    新都县桂湖公社
    一亩油菜一群蜂
    本报讯现在，四川新都桂湖公社养蜂场里一片繁忙景象。木工厂忙着赶制蜂桶，巢础厂忙着生产列子和王浆，养蜂员正在提前培育蜂王，扩大蜂群。七千多个蜂桶（包括外地来的），已经分别放在油菜田的附近采花酿蜜。
    这个公社蜜源丰富，阳春二月，遍地菜花黄，是发展蜜蜂的好地方。为了适应今年油菜生产的更大增产需要，养蜂场决定今年蜂群在去年二千四百五十三群的基础上增加七倍，达到每亩油菜有蜜蜂一群，使油菜每个分枝结荚由去年的十六个增加到三十六个，每个荚由去年的十六粒增加到二十多粒，达到荚满尖、粒饱满、消灭哑米，获得大丰收。同时使蜂蜜由去年的四千八百斤再增加五倍。
    为了使蜂王健壮多产卵和给产卵贮蜜准备好条件，养蜂场已生产出大批的王浆和列子，同时赶制了一千多个蜂桶，给蜂群不断扩大作好准备。
