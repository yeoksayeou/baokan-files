Arriving at the entrance of the machine repair workshop and seeing the two full train cars of drill bits for the rock drills, I immediately felt irritated again.

Just now, at the production meeting, the mining team raised that the rock drills were almost going to halt production because of the shortage of drill bits. Today, two train cars of drill bits had arrived, so they requested that our workshop immediately process a batch to supply them. In the end, Mine Director Chen even requested that we deliver twenty pieces within three days. I have always been quite brave in accepting tasks, and although I agreed this time as well, I didn't have any confidence in my heart.

"Director, can you allocate a small motor to us?" Suddenly someone pulled me, interrupting my thoughts. Turning my head, it turned out to be the lathe operator team leader, Little Chen.

"No, I don't," I replied, spreading my hands. I thought to myself: These two train cars of drill bits are already annoying enough, and now you're asking for a motor!

"In that case, our innovation project is blown? Sigh!" Little Chen sighed in disappointment and turned to leave.

"Innovation?" My eyes suddenly lit up, and I immediately became interested. Having been the workshop director for these past few days, I deeply understood the powerful force of the word "innovation." It was like a magician who could grab several truckloads of items from the vast air. I quickly asked him:

"What kind of innovation is it?"

"It's for this!" Little Chen nodded towards the pile of drill bits: "We saw these drill bits arriving and felt that the task was huge. In the past, processing drill bits involved five processes, using four lathes, which was very troublesome. We've researched a simple, dedicated lathe that can be completed in just one process, which greatly increases efficiency. However, there is no motor..."

Before Little Chen finished speaking, I grabbed him and asked impatiently:

"Are you confident?"

"It's hard to say, we haven't tested it yet," he said with a distressed look: "Besides, there's no motor in sight!"

"No, I'll find a way," I said: "But the production of these drill bits is urgently needed. Your innovation needs to be done quickly!"

"Okay! It will definitely be done by tomorrow morning!" Hearing what I said, Little Chen also got excited. He rubbed his hands and turned to run to the workshop.

As soon as Little Chen left, I started to worry again. Heaven knows, where am I going to find a motor!

I ran all over the warehouses and workshops, and made many phone calls, asking many people, but the replies were all the same: "No!" I had no choice but to walk back to the office dejectedly.

Just as I reached the door, the workshop welfare officer rushed towards me. As soon as he saw me, he said happily:

"I was just looking for you! Our canteen is doing technological innovation and has made an electric vegetable cutter by ourselves today. Would you like to take a look?" Saying that, he pulled me and ran.

Arriving at the canteen and seeing the electric vegetable cutter, the welfare officer began to talk endlessly about its benefits; but my eyes were now focused on one thing on it.

It turned out that this vegetable cutter was driven by a motor. What if this motor was used on the small lathe? I myself felt that this method of robbing Peter to pay Paul was not the best solution. But, thinking about it, there was no other way out, so I hardened my heart, pulled the welfare officer aside, and directly proposed: To remove the motor from the vegetable cutter and use it on the simple lathe. The reason was that the production task was very urgent, and cutting vegetables could be temporarily replaced by hand.

"Then, this vegetable cutter will never work again!" The welfare officer said with a troubled expression.

"I'll try to squeeze out a motor from somewhere else for you in the next few days!"

"Okay..." The welfare officer nodded dejectedly.

"You need to get your own thinking straight and do some mobilization work..." I tried to persuade him until he dispelled his worries, and then I left the canteen.

The next morning, without eating breakfast, I ran to the workshop. Little Chen, covered in oil, was coming out of the workshop. When he saw me, he stopped and asked:

"Do you have the motor?"

"Did you succeed in the trial?" I was eager to know the outcome and didn't answer immediately.

"Come in and see for yourself!" Saying that, he grabbed my hand and walked into the workshop.

In a corner of the factory building, a small, unassuming simple lathe was processing drill bits with three actions simultaneously. What surprised me most was that the main shaft, which should have been driven by a motor, was now hung on the motor of another lathe with a belt.

"So, you don't need the motor?" I asked in surprise.

"No need!" Little Chen replied happily: "Don't look at this ugly lathe, it's very efficient! It only takes twenty minutes to machine a drill bit! More than twenty times faster than before!"

"Then, the task of the twenty drill bits assigned by the mine can be completed today?" I became happy.

"Of course!..."

As he was speaking, the welfare officer led several people and sent the motor of the vegetable cutter with a handcart.

"No need, you should take it back and install it!" I said to the welfare officer.

"We don't need it either!" The welfare officer said with a happy face.

"What's wrong?" I became strange again. Probably, I got up too early today, and everything I encountered was strange.

"At first, when I heard that the motor was to be dismantled, some comrades didn't quite understand. After everyone discussed it for a while, the misunderstanding turned into finding a solution. Several cooks from the countryside proposed using the small stream behind the canteen as power, just like the water mills used in the countryside, and the vegetable cutter could work again!" The welfare officer finished speaking in one breath, and kept gesturing with his hands.

"Isn't this motor redundant?" Little Chen seemed a little regretful.

"Give it to us! Give it to us!" Planing team leader Lao Fang didn't want to miss the opportunity and quickly reached out to me and asked: "We are trying to make a universal planer, and we are missing a motor!"

"Okay! I'll transfer it to you!" I nodded in agreement, walked to the phone, grabbed the receiver and shouted:

"Hey! Send a car quickly to pull the drill bits!"

    马达问题
    李北桂
    来到机修工段的门口，望见那满满两个车皮的穿孔机大钎，心里顿时又烦躁起来。
    刚才在生产会上，采矿车间提出：因为大钎不足，穿孔机几乎要停产了。今天正好运来了两车皮大钎，因此要求我们车间马上加工一批供给他们。最后，陈矿长还提出要我们在三天内交出二十根来。我一向接受任务都是比较勇敢的，这次虽然也应承了下来，可是心里一点把握也没有。
    “主任，能拨给我们一台小马达么？”猛然有人拉了我一下，打断了我的思绪。扭头一看，原来是车工班长小陈。
    “没有呀！”我摊开两手答道。心里暗想：这两车大钎就够烦人的了，你还来要什么马达！
    “这么说，我们那个革新项目就算吹了？唉！”小陈失望地叹了口气，转身想走。
    “革新？”我眼睛忽然一亮，顿时留起神来。当了这些日子的车间主任，深深地领会到“革新”这两个字的强大威力。它就像是一个魔术师，从茫茫的空气中也能给你抓出几卡车物件来。我赶忙问他道：
    “是什么革新呵？”
    “就是为了它呗！”小陈朝着那堆大钎努努嘴：“我们看见来了这些大钎，感到任务很大。过去加工大钎，一共要经过五道工序，上下四台床子，十分麻烦。我们几个人研究出了一个简易的专用车床，只经过一道工序就可以完工，效率也就高了。可是，马达却没有，……”
    小陈还没说完，我就把他揪住，迫不及待地问道：
    “有把握么？”
    “难说，还没有试验哩。”他苦着脸说道：“再说，马达也没着落呵！”
    “不，我去想办法。”我说：“不过这大钎生产上急用。你们的革新得早点搞出来啊！”
    “好！明早以前一定搞成！”听我一说，小陈也来劲了。他摩拳擦掌地转身就往车间跑去。
    小陈一走，我又犯起愁来。天知道，我上哪儿去弄马达呀！
    我跑遍了仓库、车间，还打了许多电话，问了许多人，答复都是一致的：“没有！”我只好没精打采地走回办公室来。
    刚到门口，只见车间福利员迎面闯来。他一看到我，高兴地说道：
    “正找您哩！咱们食堂闹技术革新，今天自己动手作了个电动切菜机，去看看好么？”说着，他拉着我便跑。
    来到食堂，看到了电动切菜机，福利员便滔滔不绝地诉说起它的好处来；可是我的眼睛此时却专心一意地瞅着上面的一件东西。
    原来这台切菜机是用马达转动的。如果把这马达用到小车床上去呢？我自己也感到这种挖肉补疮的作法并非上策。但是，想来想去，还是没有旁的出路，只好横了心，拉着福利员走到一旁，直截了当地提出：把切菜机上的马达拆下来，拿到简易车床上去用。理由是生产任务十分火急，而切菜暂时还可以用手工代替。
    “那么，这切菜机就再也开不动了！”福利员面有难色地说。
    “这几天我想法从别的地方挤出一台马达给你们！”
    “好吧……”福利员泄气地点点头。
    “你自己的思想要通，还要作些动员工作……”我努力说服他，直到他驱散愁容时，我才离开食堂。
    第二天清晨，早饭没吃，我就往车间跑去。小陈满身油污的正从车间出来，一看见我，便站住问道：
    “马达有了么？”
    “你们试成功了么？”我急于知道结局如何，没有马上回答。
    “您进来看看再说吧！”说着，一把拉住我的手，走进车间。
    在厂房的一个角落，一部不大的、外貌不扬的简易车床，正在同时用三种动作加工大钎。特别使我惊异的是：本来应当由马达传动的主轴，现在却用一根皮带挂在另一台车床的马达上。
    “这么说，马达不要了？”我惊喜地问道。
    “不要了！”小陈愉快地答道：“别看这床子难看，效率可高啦！车大钎二十分钟就一根！比过去提高二十多倍！”
    “那么，矿里交来的二十根大钎的任务，不是今天就可以完成了么？”我高兴起来了。
    “当然！……”
    正说着，福利员领着几个人，用手推车，把切菜机的马达送来了。
    “不用了，你们还是拿回去装上吧！”我对福利员说道。
    “我们也不用了！”福利员满面春风地说。
    “怎么啦？”我又奇怪起来。大概是今天起得太早了，碰到的都是怪事。
    “开始听说要拆马达，好些同志思想都不大通。大家讨论一阵后，便由不通变成想办法了。几个由农村来的炊事员同志提出像农村用的水磨那样，利用食堂后面那条小溪作动力，切菜机又能动了！”福利员一气不歇地说完，还不时用手势比划着。
    “这台马达不是多余了？”小陈似乎有些惋惜。
    “给我们吧！给我们吧！”刨工班长老方不肯错过良机，赶忙向我伸出手来要求着：“我们正在试制一台万能刨床，正缺一台马达哩！”
    “好吧！就调给你们！”我一面点头同意，一面走到电话旁边，抓起听筒就喊道：
    “喂！你们赶快派车来拉大钎吧！”
