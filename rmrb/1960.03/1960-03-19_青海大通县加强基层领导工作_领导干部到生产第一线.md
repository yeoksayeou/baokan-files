Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 18th: In response to the call of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to "go to the front line," the County Party Secretary of Datong County, Qinghai Province, the Commune Party Secretaries, and the Brigade Party Branch Secretaries are taking practical actions by concurrently holding leadership positions in production teams. Their personal presence on the production front has made the mass movement to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture this year develop even more vigorously and solidly in rural areas.

When the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to "go to the front line," the Datong County Party Committee promptly studied it and immediately made a resolution requiring county, commune party committees, and brigade party branch secretaries to concurrently hold a leadership position in a production team. It pointed out that this practice is a major measure to strengthen leadership at the front line, help grassroots cadres improve their work level, and push the mass movement to a new peak; it is also an effective method to further improve leadership style and make the Party's work deeper, more detailed, and more practical. It also pointed out that the principle of holding concurrent positions is: first, in the spirit of the working method of "grasping both ends to bring along the middle," one should generally go to production teams with a relatively poor foundation to hold concurrent positions. Second, in order to train the original grassroots cadres, improve their working abilities, and give play to their enthusiasm and initiative, higher-level leading cadres generally only hold deputy positions.

Party organizations at all levels in the county resolutely implemented the county party committee's resolution. Zhao Ming, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Zou Zhuquan, the Secretary, have already gone to the Xiamen Production Team of the Jiefang Commune and the Jile Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, respectively, to serve as Deputy Party Branch Secretaries. Ye Xiaozhu, Secretary of the County Party Committee and Secretary of the Chengguan Commune Party Committee, also went to the Dongguan Second Production Team of his own commune to serve as Deputy Party Branch Secretary. At present, all commune party secretaries and most brigade party branch secretaries have already started working in the production teams where they hold concurrent positions. The production teams chosen by leading comrades at all levels for concurrent positions are mostly backward production teams, with the exception of a few relatively advanced teams. In order to enable backward production teams to catch up with advanced production teams more quickly, the Datong County Party Committee recently decided to have Zou Zhuquan, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, specially in charge of the work of backward production teams.

Although the time that higher-level leading cadres have been holding leadership positions in production teams is not long, they have already achieved remarkable results, making the advanced more advanced and the backward quickly catching up with the advanced level. Since Ye Xiaozhu concurrently served as the Deputy Party Branch Secretary of the Dongguan Second Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, the production and life of this team have been better arranged. Cadres generally participated in production, and the masses were greatly encouraged. The team's current spring plowing production has basically reached the level of advanced production teams. After Ha Chengfu, Secretary of the Duolin Commune Party Committee, concurrently served as Deputy Branch Secretary of the Hazhou Production Team, he went deep among the masses and led the production team to consolidate and run the public canteens well, and properly arranged the lives of the masses. In the process of producing together with the masses, he discovered that the production team's labor potential had not been fully utilized, so he promptly organized a labor competition, which greatly increased the attendance rate and labor efficiency of the commune members. Now the production of this team is thriving. After Han Guoliang, Secretary of the Dongxia Commune Party Committee, held a concurrent position in the Kema Production Team, he deeply understood the different ideological situations of the commune members, and in response to these situations, he led the production team to further strengthen ideological leadership, making the work of this team solid and thorough. Han Guoliang said when summarizing the gains from his concurrent position: Because he went deeper into reality and understood many situations that are not easy to know by relying on reports, he felt more confident when considering work, and the work arrangements were more in line with reality.

    青海大通县加强基层领导工作
    领导干部到生产第一线
    新华社西宁18日电　青海省大通县县委书记、公社党委书记和大队党总支书记，以实际行动响应中共青海省委提出的“到第一线去”的号召，纷纷到生产队兼任领导职务。由于他们亲临生产前线，使得当前农村中为争取今年农业全面大丰收的群众运动，开展得更加轰轰烈烈和扎扎实实。
    当青海省委提出“到第一线去”的号召后，中共大通县委及时进行了研究，并立即作出决议，要求县、社党委和大队党总支书记，到生产队兼任一项领导职务，指出这种做法是加强第一线的领导力量、帮助基层干部提高工作水平和把群众运动推向新的高峰的重大措施；也是进一步改进领导作风，使党的工作做得更深、更细、更实的有效方法。并指出兼职的原则是：一，本着“抓两头带中间”的工作方法的精神，一般应该到基础较差的生产队去兼职。二，为了锻炼原有基层干部，提高他们的工作能力，发挥他们的积极性和主动性，上级领导干部一般只兼任副职。
    全县各级党组织坚决执行了县委的决议。县委第一书记赵明和书记邹主权已经分别到解放公社峡门生产队和城关公社极乐生产队兼任党支部副书记。县委书记、城关公社党委书记叶晓竹也到本公社的东关第二生产队兼任党支部副书记。目前，所有公社党委书记和大部分大队党总支书记，都已经到兼职的生产队开始工作。各级领导同志选择兼职的生产队，除了少数是比较先进的队以外，大部分是后进生产队。为了使后进生产队更快地赶上先进生产队，中共大通县委最近还决定由县委书记邹主权专门分工抓后进生产队的工作。
    上级领导干部到生产队兼任领导职务的时间虽然还不长，但是已经取得了显著成绩，使先进的更加先进，后进的迅速赶上先进水平。城关公社东关第二生产队自从叶晓竹兼任党支部副书记以后，使这个队的生产和生活都得到较好的安排。干部普遍参加了生产，群众得到了巨大的鼓舞。这个队目前的春耕生产基本上达到了先进生产队的水平。多林公社党委书记哈成福到哈州生产队兼任副支部书记以后，深入群众，领导生产队巩固和办好了公共食堂，妥善安排了群众生活。他在和群众一道生产中，发现生产队的劳动潜力没有充分发挥，便及时组织劳动竞赛，使社员的出勤率和劳动效率都大大提高。现在这个队的生产蒸蒸日上。东峡公社党委书记韩国良到克麻生产队兼职以后，深入地了解了社员的不同思想情况，并针对这些情况领导生产队进一步加强了思想领导，使这个队的工作做得踏实深透。韩国良在总结兼职的收获时说：由于更加深入实际，了解了许多依靠汇报不容易知道的情况，考虑工作时心中就更加有底，工作安排也就更加符合实际。
