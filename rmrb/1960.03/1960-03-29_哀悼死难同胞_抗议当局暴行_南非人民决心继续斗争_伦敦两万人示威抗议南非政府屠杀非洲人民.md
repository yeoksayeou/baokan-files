Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Johannesburg dispatch: Africans across South Africa, responding to the call of the African National Congress of South Africa, held a "Day of Mourning" today to protest the authorities' massacre of their compatriots and to oppose racial discrimination laws.

In Johannesburg and other cities, many workers, despite police threats and persecution, did not go to work today. In Cape Town, African workers in public transport, construction, and milk and bread delivery services almost all went on strike.

African National Congress President Luthuli issued a statement to the press saying that it is useless for the government to deal with the current situation with crude police methods and prohibitions. He said that the African National Congress is prepared to continue the struggle to abolish the "Pass Laws" and obtain full democratic rights.

The situation in various parts of South Africa is very tense, with military police vehicles parked around police stations. Armed police were on alert all night last night, ready to be dispatched at any time to suppress and persecute Africans.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 27th: Twenty thousand people held a mass demonstration in central London today, protesting the South African government's massacre of African people and condemning the British government for not condemning the South African government's atrocities.

The mass demonstration began with a march involving thousands of people. The procession started from Hyde Park, passed through the main streets of central London, and arrived at Trafalgar Square.

Angry demonstrators held up huge photographs of South African white police shooting and beating African blacks. Banners and placards also bore slogans such as "Stop the Massacre," "Down with Apartheid," "Stop Fascism," "Boycott South African Goods," and so on.

Many demonstrators were from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. They marched alongside demonstrators from British political groups, trade unions, peace organizations, and church organizations.

When the demonstrators arrived at Trafalgar Square, tens of thousands of people had already gathered there, ready to participate in the protest rally. The rally was held in front of the South African High Commission. Waving banners, the marchers surrounded the South African High Commission, expressing indignation at the atrocities of massacring Africans.

A large number of police stood in front of the South African High Commission. In the past few days, people have been demonstrating here day and night, and many people have been arrested. Today, the authorities transferred another batch of police from other areas. Some police officers were also carrying batons. Some people were arrested again today.

Labor Party MP Barbara Castle spoke at the protest rally. She said that the gathering was held to mourn the Africans killed in South Africa and to ensure that the struggle would not stop until the policy of enslaving the South African people was completely abolished. She rebuked the British government for not condemning the South African government's atrocities.

The conference passed a resolution expressing condolences to the African men, women, and children who were massacred, condemning the South African government's apartheid policy, and pledging to continue boycotting South African goods.

In addition, the African Organizations Committee in London issued a statement on the 25th condemning the decision of the South African Federal authorities to ban the African National Congress of South Africa, stating: "We want to remind the world, and especially warn the fascist government of South Africa, that Africans can no longer tolerate the existence of governments based on racial superiority on their African continent."
