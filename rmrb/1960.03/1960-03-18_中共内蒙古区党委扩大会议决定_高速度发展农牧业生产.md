The CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee Enlarged Meeting Decides to Develop Agricultural and Pastoral Production at High Speed

    (By our staff reporter) The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee held a plenary session (enlarged) and decided to develop agriculture at high speed, striving to produce 1,700 jin of grain per capita based on the agricultural population, launching a campaign to study Mao Zedong's works, and realizing a sustained leap forward in socialist construction.
    The Eleventh Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the meeting of the first secretaries of the banner and county party committees were held in Hohhot, the capital of the autonomous region, from February 10th to 24th. The meeting listened to the report "New Stage, New Situation, New Tasks" made by Comrade Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, on behalf of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee. After discussion, the meeting unanimously agreed with this report, believing that this report has a significant educational and encouraging effect on the struggle of party members, cadres, and people of all ethnic groups in the region to victoriously achieve a continuous leap forward. The meeting summarized the work in 1959 and made arrangements for the work in 1960. The meeting held that thanks to the entire party holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the autonomous region achieved great victories in the political and ideological front, the economic front, the cultural and educational front, and in ethnic relations in 1959. As a result, it took a big step forward in fundamentally changing the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, laying a solid foundation for the continued leap forward in 1960.
    The meeting believed that on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the autonomous region achieved a sustained leap forward last year. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the region reached 3.57 billion yuan, an increase of 32% compared with 1958, far exceeding the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period.
    In accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," the meeting defined the guiding principles and tasks for the autonomous region's construction in 1960 as: holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better implementing the party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of two-pronged approaches, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, taking agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation, vigorously developing the steel industry and the forest industry, so that industrial, agricultural, pastoral, and forestry production are combined with each other to comprehensively develop the national economy. It is necessary to take grain as the key link, vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry, realize the comprehensive development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and correspondingly develop light industry and handicrafts; take steel as the key link, vigorously develop the steel industry and other industries, and vigorously strengthen the construction of the electric power industry, mining industry, building materials industry, and transportation; further improve financial and trade work, focusing on supporting the development of production and organizing the people's economic life, actively organize the purchase and supply of materials, and guide and arrange the economic life of urban and rural people; further strengthen the construction of cultural, educational, health, scientific research, and theoretical work, strengthen the construction of political and legal affairs and militia work, vigorously train and promote cadres, so that they can quickly catch up with the needs of the great development of production and construction. The meeting approved the draft plan for the development of the national economy in the autonomous region in 1960, requiring that agricultural and pastoral production and pastoral area construction, steel industry construction centered on Baotou, and forestry construction centered on the Greater Khingan Range forest industry be the focus of the autonomous region's construction. The meeting decided to submit this draft plan to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee for discussion and approval, and then submit it to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Congress to be held this year for review and approval.
    The meeting focused on discussing the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation and implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and the issue of vigorously developing agriculture and animal husbandry with grain as the key link. In order to develop agriculture at high speed, the meeting proposed launching a campaign throughout the region to produce an average of 1,700 jin of grain per capita based on the agricultural population, and wealthy areas should strive to produce an average of more than 2,000 jin of grain per agricultural population. To this end, it is required to adhere to the two-pronged approach of simultaneously focusing on high yields and multiple harvests and multiple plantings in agricultural production, cultivate 20 million mu of basic farmland well, achieve large-area high yields, expand the cultivated land area to 80 million mu, and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions. Appropriately expand the suburbs of cities, requiring all cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas to implement the principle of simultaneously focusing on industry and agriculture, vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry, not only develop non-staple food production, but also achieve partial, major, or complete self-sufficiency in grain. All pastoral areas must vigorously develop agriculture, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and feed in most pastoral areas in 1960. Give full play to the advantages of combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously develop animal husbandry. In the production of cattle, horses, camels, sheep and other animal husbandry, continue to carry out the "100 mothers, 100 offspring" campaign, using this as the key link to promote the comprehensive and high-speed development of animal husbandry. In agricultural areas, strive to basically achieve one pig per agricultural person. Organize industry to support agriculture and animal husbandry, focus on water conservancy and semi-mechanization, and the focus of agricultural tool reform is on water conservancy tools, cultivation, harvesting, threshing, and transportation; the focus of pastoral tool reform is on grass cutting, hay raking, grass chopping, shearing, and water conservancy equipment, and appropriately arrange agricultural and sideline product processing tools. In order to develop agricultural and pastoral production at high speed, it is necessary to implement putting politics in command, further consolidate and build people's communes, and currently focus on resolving the remaining issues in distribution, developing the commune's economy, supporting poor teams, improving the commune's management level, strengthening economic accounting, arranging the lives of commune members, and running public canteens well, in order to boost the greater revolutionary drive of farmers and herdsmen and strive for another bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry.
    The meeting also focused on discussing the issues of technological revolution, technological innovation, and technological transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry. It was believed that this movement must be vigorously carried out to improve the labor productivity of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and various productions, and gradually realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agriculture and animal husbandry. The meeting demanded that, through technological innovation and technological revolution, efforts should be made to increase labor efficiency by half, one time, or more, and strive for each person to do the work of one and a half to two people.
    In order to victoriously realize the continuous leap forward in the entire national economic construction in 1960, the meeting believed that the entire autonomous region should immediately launch the study of Mao Zedong's works, and currently focus on studying Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on socialist revolution and socialist construction, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm all party members, cadres, and people to improve their leadership level and guide practical work.
    The meeting believed that strengthening the party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and vigorously launching mass movements are the guarantee for the victory of work. The party organizations in the entire autonomous region should use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to further improve their leadership level, improve leadership methods and work styles, continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads, the two lines, and the two work styles, and raise the red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes even higher, and forge ahead courageously.

    中共内蒙古自治区委员会第十一次全体委员会议（扩大）和旗、县委第一书记会议，于2月10日到24日在自治区首府——呼和浩特举行。会议听取了内蒙古党委第一书记乌兰夫同志代表内蒙古党委所作的“新阶段、新形势、新任务”的报告。经过讨论一致同意这个报告，认为这个报告对全区党员、干部和各族人民胜利实现继续跃进的斗争具有重大的教育和鼓舞作用。会议总结了1959年的工作，并部署了1960年的工作。会议认为：自治区由于全党高举着毛泽东思想的旗帜，高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，1959年，自治区在政治思想战线，在经济战线，在文教战线，在民族关系方面，都取得了巨大的胜利，因而在根本改变内蒙古自治区的面貌上大大前进了一步，为1960年的继续跃进，打下了深厚的基础。
    会议认为自治区去年在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了持续的跃进。全区工农业总产值达到三十五点七亿元，比1958年增长32％。远远超过第一个五年计划期间平均增长的速度。
    会议按照“全国一盘棋”的精神，把自治区1960年的建设方针任务规定为：高举毛泽东思想的红旗，更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，以农牧业为基础，大力发展钢铁工业和森林工业，使工农牧林业生产相互结合，全面发展国民经济。要以粮为纲，大力发展农业和畜牧业，实现农牧林副渔的全面发展，相应地发展轻工业和手工业；以钢为纲，大力发展钢铁工业和其他工业，要大力加强电力工业、采掘工业、建筑材料工业和交通运输建设；进一步做好财贸工作，以支持生产的发展和组织人民经济生活为中心，积极组织物资的收购和供应，并指导与安排好城乡人民的经济生活；要进一步加强文化教育卫生事业及科学研究和理论工作的建设，加强政法和民兵工作的建设，大力培养和提拔干部，使之迅速赶上生产建设大发展的需要。会议批准了1960年自治区发展国民经济的计划草案，要求以农牧业生产和牧区建设，以包头为中心的钢铁工业建设，以大兴安岭森林工业为中心的林业建设，作为自治区建设的重点。会议决定把这个计划草案提交内蒙古自治区人民委员会讨论通过后提请今年召开的内蒙古自治区人代会审查批准。
    会议着重讨论了以农业为基础实行工农业并举的方针，和以粮为纲大力发展农牧业的问题。为了高速度发展农业，会议提出在全区开展按农业人口平均每人生产一千七百斤粮食的运动，富饶的地区要争取每个农业人口平均生产两千斤以上的粮食。为此，要求在农业生产中坚持高产多收与多种多收并举的两条腿走路的方针，种好二千万亩基本田，实现大面积丰产，把耕地面积扩大到八千万亩，因地制宜地全面实施农业“八字宪法”，适当扩大城市郊区，要求所有城市、工矿区、林区，都要贯彻工农业并举的方针，大力发展农牧业，不但要发展副食品生产，而且要实现粮食一部、大部或全部自给。所有牧区都要大力发展农业，争取大部牧区在1960年实现粮食和饲料自给。充分发挥农牧业结合的优越性，大力发展畜牧业。在牛、马、骆驼、羊等畜牧业生产中，继续开展“百母百仔”运动，以此为纲来推动畜牧业的全面的高速度的发展。在农业区力争基本实现每个农业人口一人一猪。组织工业支援农、牧业，大抓水利和半机械化，农业工具改革的重点放在水利工具、中耕、收割、脱粒、运输方面；牧业工具改革的重点放在打草、搂草、铡草、剪毛和水利设备方面，适当安排农副产品加工工具。为了高速度发展农牧业生产，必须实行政治挂帅，进一步巩固和建设人民公社，当前要着重解决分配中的遗留问题，发展公社的经济，扶植穷队，提高公社的经营管理水平，加强经济核算，安排好社员生活，办好公共食堂，以鼓足农牧民群众的更大革命干劲，争取农牧业再一个大丰收。
    会议还着重讨论了技术革命、技术革新和对农牧业的技术改造问题。认为必须大力开展这一运动以提高工、农、牧、林业和各项生产的劳动生产率，和逐步实现农牧业的机械化和半机械化。会议要求，经过技术革新和技术革命，力争提高劳动效率半倍、一倍或者更多一点，力争每一个人做一个半人到两个人的事情。
    为了胜利实现1960年整个国民经济建设的持续跃进，会议认为全自治区应当立即展开学习毛泽东著作，当前着重学习毛泽东同志社会主义革命和社会主义建设的学说，用毛泽东思想武装全体党员、干部和人民，来提高领导水平，指导实际工作。
    会议认为加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，是工作胜利的保证，全自治区党的组织都应该以毛泽东思想为指导来进一步提高领导水平。改进领导方法和工作作风，继续开展两条道路、两条路线、两种作风的斗争，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，奋勇前进。
