Meddling in "other people's business" was the philosophy of self-preservation in the old society; meddling in "other people's business" is the noble style of the working people in the new society.

In Beixinjing Town, Shanghai, ten old mothers organized a group known as the "Special Duty Mothers' Group," which enthusiastically and actively supports agricultural production without asking for remuneration or fearing difficulties. Of these ten old mothers, two were of worker origin and eight were workers' family members. They all had children and grandchildren, and lived a good life with enough to eat and wear. However, they were unwilling to sit at home and enjoy themselves, and were determined to do something beneficial for the people. They said, "Young people are working hard for the country in various positions, and we can't just do housework all the time. We must also go out and find something to do, to move a few bricks and build a foundation for socialist construction." They did what they said. From 1957 to the present, for three years as one day, they have insisted on participating in various voluntary labor activities. In addition to cleaning the neighborhood and eliminating the "seven pests," they mainly help farmers with production. In the past three years, they have accumulated more than 13,200 loads of fertilizer for the farmers. Regarding this practice of fulfilling obligations and not fearing hardship, some people initially found it strange, saying that they were "not enjoying their blessings and liked to meddle in other people's business." However, these ten old mothers themselves composed a song that says: "Ten mothers with one heart, wholeheartedly engaged in fulfilling obligations, working one day at a time, to build the People's Commune well, so that socialism arrives sooner."

The spirit of the ten old mothers who love to meddle in "other people's business" demonstrates their boundless love and high sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist construction. It is said that these workers' family members are fully entitled to enjoy a comfortable and happy life in their later years, and our society has also created a pleasant and happy living environment for them. However, they insist on not being idle at home, and must come out to "move a few bricks and build a foundation for socialist construction," and must "work one day at a time." What force is supporting them? It is because they regard every matter related to the vital interests of the people as their own duty, and not as "other people's business" that can be managed or ignored. This sense of responsibility comes entirely from the genuine revolutionary consciousness of the working people. In their view, any socialist construction undertaking is not "none of my business" "other people's business," but a major event that not only "concerns me" but also concerns the interests of the broad masses of people, so they must manage it. Whether they manage more or less, they always pour all their efforts and enthusiasm into the proletarian revolutionary cause. This spirit of loving to meddle in "other people's business" should be said to be the true color of the working people. In the past, the rulers regarded the working people as slaves, and did not allow the people to interfere in anything, and advocated a foolish people's policy of "sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't care about the frost on others' roofs." But the proletariat and the working people are the people who love to meddle in "other people's business" the most. They must manage everything related to the interests of the proletariat, and manage it thoroughly, so as to transform the entire society and the face of nature by revolutionary means. Today, the proletariat and the working people have become the masters of the country, they have more things to manage, and greater responsibilities, so the spirit of loving to meddle in "other people's business" has been further developed.

In fact, in our revolutionary and construction undertakings, there is originally no such thing as "other people's business." In the eyes of the working class, who have the ambition and vision to take the world as their own responsibility, there is only the distinction between whether things are beneficial or detrimental to the revolution, and there is no distinction between "main business" and "other people's business." Whether it is one's own business or other people's business; whether it is the business of this region or the business of that region, or even things that seem completely unrelated to them, the proletariat and the working people must care about it, must ask about it, and must take action to manage it.

This kind of "managing" is not for oneself, but for others, not for private interests, but for public interests. Look at those ten old mothers, they don't seek fame or profit, just to "make socialism come sooner," they consciously put their own narrow interests in a secondary position. Because they realize that building a beautiful socialist society is the greatest interest of the working people, and also their own greatest happiness. Starting from this understanding, all so-called "other people's business" naturally becomes a major event that must be managed in the revolutionary collective cause.

Chairman Mao often told us to "serve the people." This sentence has generated great power not only in our revolutionary ranks, but also among the broad masses of the people. People regard "serving the people" as their guide to action. Use this sentence to spur and encourage yourself to move forward. If you "serve the people," you will naturally give off one point of heat and one point of light, and there is no such thing as meddling in "other people's business," but fulfilling responsibilities and fulfilling obligations. The brilliance of Mao Zedong's thought has deeply penetrated people's hearts, and the spirit of meddling in "other people's business" has become a general trend throughout the country. In our society, everyone has their own position and their own responsibilities, but people are not satisfied with these. In addition to completing their own tasks, they also care about other people's affairs and collective affairs; the advanced help the backward, the large factories help the small factories, the rich teams help the poor teams, the industrial departments support agricultural production, this region assists that region, and a communist style of cooperation is vigorously promoted everywhere. Loving to meddle in "other people's business" has simply become a social trend. All of these are reflections of Mao Zedong Thought in the spirit of the people. We advocate that everyone loves to meddle in "other people's business," and meddle more in "other people's business." This is the spirit of our times, and also the style of our times.

### 多管“闲事”

    多管“闲事”
    于之海
    少管“闲事”，是旧社会明哲保身的处世哲学；多管“闲事”，是新社会里劳动人民的高尚风格。
    在上海北新泾镇上，有十位老妈妈组织了一个被人称为“专尽义务的妈妈组”，不计报酬，不怕困难，热情积极地支援农业生产。这十位老妈妈，两位是工人出身，八位是工人家属。她们都是儿孙满堂，有吃有穿的，生活过得很好。可是她们不愿意坐在家里享福，一心一意要为人们做些有益的事情。她们说：“年轻人在各个岗位上为国家出力，我们不能老搞家务，也要出去找点事情做做，为社会主义建设搬几块砖头，砌砌墙脚。”她们说干就干，从1957年到现在，三年如一日，坚持参加各项义务劳动，除了在里弄大扫除、除七害以外，主要是帮助农民搞生产，三年来，光是为农民积的肥料就有一万三千二百多担。对于这种专尽义务，不辞辛苦的作法，最初有的人感到奇怪，说她们是“有福不享，爱管闲事”。可是这十位老妈妈却自己编了一首歌唱道：“十个妈妈心一条，一心一意把义务搞，活一天要干一天，人民公社建设好，社会主义早来到。”
    十位老妈妈爱管“闲事”的精神，表现了她们对社会主义建设事业充满了无限的热爱和高度的责任感。按说，这些工人家属，完全有条件舒舒服服地享受晚年的幸福生活，我们的社会也为她们创造了愉快、幸福的生活环境。可是，她们偏偏在家里闲不住，一定要出来“为社会主义建设搬几块砖头，砌砌墙脚”，一定要“活一天干一天”。是什么力量在支持她们？就是因为她们把每一件关系到人民群众切身利益的事情，都看成是自己的本份，而不是当作可管可不管的“闲事”。这种责任感，完全出自真挚的劳动人民的革命自觉性。在她们看来，任何一项社会主义建设事业都不是什么“事不关己，高高挂起”的“闲事”，而是不仅“关己”，还关系到广大人民群众利益的大事，所以她们一定要去管。无论是管多也罢，管少也罢，她们总是把自己的全部心血和热力都贯注到无产阶级的革命事业中去。这种爱管“闲事”的精神，应该说是劳动人民的本色。过去，统治者们把劳动人民当作奴隶，任何事情都不准人民过问，并且宣扬一种“自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”的愚民之道。可是无产阶级和劳动人民却是最爱管“闲事”的人，凡是和无产阶级的利益有关的事情，他们都要管，而且管得多，管得彻底，以致用革命的手段改造整个社会的面貌和自然的面貌。今天，无产阶级和劳动人民成为国家的主人，他们要管的事情更多了，责任更重了，于是爱管“闲事”的精神也就更加发扬起来了。
    其实，在我们的革命和建设事业中，本来是没有什么“闲事”的。在具有以天下为己任的胸襟和远大眼光的工人阶级看来，事情只有对革命有利还是不利之分，而无“正事”“闲事”之别。无论是自己的事情也好，别人的事情也好；这个地区的事情也罢，那个地区的事情也罢，甚至是看来和他们完全不相干的事情，无产阶级和劳动人民都要去关心，都要去过问，都要动手去管。
    这种“管”，不是为己，而是为人，不是为私，而是为公。请看那十位老妈妈，一不图名，二不图利，就是为了使“社会主义早来到”，她们自觉地把个人狭义的利益放在了次要的地位。因为她们认识到了建设美好的社会主义是劳动人民的最大利益，也是她们自己的最大幸福。从这种认识出发，一切所谓“闲事”，就自然成了革命集体事业中不可不管的大事了。
    毛主席经常告诉我们要“为人民服务”。这句话，不仅在我们的革命队伍中，而且在广大的人民群众中都产生了巨大的力量。人们把“为人民服务”当作自己行动的指南。用这句话鞭策和鼓舞自己前进。“为人民服务”嘛，自然就有一分热发一分光，无所谓什么管“闲事”，而是尽责任，尽义务。毛主席的思想光辉深入人心，管“闲事”的精神蔚然成风，遍及全国。在我们的社会里，每人都有自己的岗位，自己的职责，可是人们并不满足于这些，他们除了完成自己担负的任务，还要去关心别人的事，关心集体的事；先进帮后进，大厂帮小厂，富队帮穷队，工业部门支援农业生产，这个地区协助那个地区，到处大兴共产主义协作之风，爱管“闲事”简直成了一种社会风气。所有这些，正是毛泽东思想在人民群众精神上的反映。我们提倡人人爱管“闲事”，多管“闲事”。这是我们时代的精神，也是我们时代的风格。
