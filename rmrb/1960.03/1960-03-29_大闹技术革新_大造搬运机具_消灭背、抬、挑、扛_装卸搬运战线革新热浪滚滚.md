Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Currently, a mass movement to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading operations is flourishing nationwide. From major land and water transportation lines, stations, ports, and warehouses to the internal transport of factories and mines, the backward state of loading and unloading work is rapidly changing.

Not Hearing Groans but Only the Sound of Motors
The city of Tianjin, where the movement has progressed the fastest, after more than two months of hard work, has seen the proportion of mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading operations in the city's nine railway freight yards, three seaports, and more than 300 factories and mines with large loading and unloading volumes jump from below 20% to over 80%. Everywhere on the loading and unloading sites, a new scene of "not hearing groans, but only the sound of motors" is presented. Beijing started in February and plans to organize three "battles" to achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading throughout the city. In the first "battle," the loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization of seven railway freight stations have been realized; now tens of thousands of people in the city are advancing victoriously, carrying out the second "battle." At the beginning of this year, it only accounted for 20% to 30% of the total loading and unloading volume, but by the first half of March, it had increased to 55%.

High Platforms are "Happiness Platforms"
The mass movement to achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading is aimed at eliminating heavy manual labor such as carrying on the back, lifting, shoulder-poles, and manual carrying, and improving operational efficiency. To achieve this goal, various localities are simultaneously carrying out work on different links in the entire transportation process, according to different types of goods and different transportation needs.

In enterprises and stations mainly engaged in loading and transporting bulk materials such as coal, ore, grain, and sand, a large number of chute-type, funnel-type, or bridge-type high platforms have been built and are still being built. This equipment can quickly load entire trains and store products. The Fuxin Coal Mine has built twelve coal storage and loading facilities at the loading points in the mining area, all of which have achieved mechanized coal loading. The average loading time is shortened by more than one-fifth compared with the fastest record in the past. At the same time, the coal storage capacity has also reached more than three times the average daily output of the coal mine, achieving "normal production even if no trains come for three days, and normal loading even if there is no production for three days." Coal loading workers have put down their shoulder-poles, large baskets, and shovels, and become mechanized coal loading drivers. With the push of a button, they can fill a car with coal in three to five minutes. They excitedly call the high platforms "happiness platforms."

Loading, Unloading, and Material Feeding in One Go
In large-scale iron and steel enterprises, power plants, and other factories and mines that mainly unload cars, various mechanized and semi-mechanized unloading machines are being created to quickly unload cars in rows and groups, while also making the unloading, material feeding, and loading equipment mutually supporting. The combined coal unloading machine created by the employees of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has increased unloading efficiency by more than 50 times. They have also created a method of "moving railway tracks" to expand the storage area for raw materials such as coking coal and ore, which has also promoted the improvement of unloading efficiency.

Comprehensive Support for Transportation Tools
In the process of realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places have further matched the different transportation tools of transportation enterprises and production enterprises to form many linked operation lines for loading and unloading, which has significantly improved loading and unloading efficiency and the turnover speed of vehicles and ships. For example, the linked operation line centered on the Beijing East Suburb Mechanized Coal Briquette Factory starts from the Mentougou and Seshu Grave coal mines. The coal produced is transported by electric locomotives into the chutes and automatically loaded into trains using pneumatically opened doors for unloading. After the coal is transported to the briquette factory, the trains automatically open the doors and unload with the push of a switch. According to calculations, this linked operation line can save more than half of the manual loading and unloading labor, and shorten the time for unloading a train of coal from one hour to ten minutes.

    The staff of the Yuehan Wharf of the Hengyang City Transport Company in Hunan Province installed a wooden panel loading and unloading line more than 100 meters long, which can transport goods from the ship directly to the car, with only 16 people operating it. In the past, the same loading and unloading task required 108 people. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Yunfeng

    大闹技术革新  大造搬运机具  消灭背、抬、挑、扛
    装卸搬运战线革新热浪滚滚
    据新华社27日讯　目前，全国范围内一个为实现装卸搬运作业机械化、半机械化的群众运动，正在如火如荼地蓬勃发展。从水陆交通干线、车站、港口、仓库，到厂矿、企业的内部运输，装卸搬运工作的落后面貌，正在朝新夕异地迅速改观。
    不闻吭哟声但听马达响
    运动进展最快的天津市，经过两个多月的奋战，全市九个铁路货场、三个海港码头和三百多个装卸量大的厂矿企业，机械化和半机械化装卸搬运作业的比重，已经由20％以下一跃而提高到80％以上。装卸搬运作业场上，到处呈现着“不闻吭哟声，但听马达响”的新景象。北京市从2月份开始，计划组织三次“战役”，实现全市装卸搬运机械化、半机械化。在第一次“战役”中，已经实现了七个铁路货运站的装卸机械化、半机械化；现在全市有数万人正乘胜前进，进行第二次“战役”。今年年初还只占全部装卸量的20％到30％，到3月上半月，已经提高到55％。
    高站台是“幸福台”
    实现装卸搬运机械化、半机械化的群众运动，是以消灭背、抬、挑、扛等笨重体力劳动和提高作业效率为目标的。为了达到这个目标，各地正在按照不同的货物种类、以及不同的运输需要，在全部运输过程的不同环节上同时进行。
    在以装运煤炭、矿石、粮食、砂石等散装物资为主的企业和车站，已经修建了并且还在修建着大量滑坡式、漏斗式或桥式高站台，这种设备既可以整列地快速装车，又可以贮存产品。阜新煤矿在矿区的装车点上建成了十二处贮煤装车设备，全部实现了装煤机械化，平均装车时间比过去最快的纪录缩短了五分之一以上；同时，贮煤能力也达到了煤矿平均日产量的三倍以上，做到了“三天不来车照常生产，三天不生产照常装车”。装煤工人们放下了扁担、大筐、铁锹，变成了机械化装车司机，一按电钮，三、五分钟就能装满一车煤，他们兴奋地把高站台叫做“幸福台”。
    装、卸、上料一条龙
    在大型钢铁企业、发电厂等以卸车为主的厂矿里，正在创制各种机械化、半机械化卸车机具，成列成组地快速卸车，同时使卸车、上料、装车的设备互相配套。太原钢铁公司职工创造的联合卸煤机，使卸车效率提高五十多倍；他们还创造了铁路搬家的办法，扩大焦煤、矿石等原料的贮存场地，也促进了卸车作业效率的提高。
    运输工具大配套
    在实现装卸搬运机械化、半机械化的过程中，北京、沈阳、哈尔滨等地，进一步把运输企业和生产企业不同的运输工具配套，组成许多装卸搬运的联动作业线，更加显著地提高了装卸效率和车船周转速度。例如，以北京东郊机制煤球厂为中心的联动作业线，从门头沟、色树坟煤矿起，生产出来的煤由电动机车运入溜仓，自动装入利用风动开门溜卸的火车；煤运到煤球厂以后，一按开关，火车自动开门、卸车。据计算，这个联动作业线可节省装卸搬运人工一半多，卸一列车煤由一小时缩短为十分钟。（附图片）
