Britain Follows the United States in Intensifying Arms Expansion and War Preparations
The Heavy Military Burden on the British People Causes Dissatisfaction with the Government's Military Expansion Policy

This Dispatch: The British government is continuing to follow the United States in intensifying arms expansion and war preparations. Many of its actions in this regard have recently attracted attention and opposition both at home and abroad.

Increase Military Spending to Develop Missiles

The British government's "Defense White Paper" released in mid-February shows that Britain, like the United States, will vigorously develop nuclear weapons and missiles, while actively improving and expanding "conventional" armaments. The White Paper announced that Britain's total military expenditure in the 1960-1961 fiscal year will be £1,629,830,000, an increase of £115,700,000 over military expenditure in the 1959-1960 fiscal year.

A large portion of the military expenditure will be used to develop nuclear weapons. The White Paper admits that the British government's "overall defense policy of nuclear arms race has not undergone major changes." It states that while developing the "Blue Streak" missile, Britain is studying the launch of long-range nuclear missiles from aircraft or submarines, researching new weapons including various types of missiles, and plans to build nuclear submarines.

The White Paper shows that in addition to continuing to actively participate in aggressive military blocs, Britain specifically takes maintaining colonial interests and suppressing the increasingly high tide of national independence movements as the guiding principles of its "defense" policy. It states: "Britain has played its role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In addition, it has sent military forces to help maintain the stability of politically sensitive areas (referring to colonies) for which it bears special responsibility." Under the guidance of such principles, while vigorously developing nuclear weapons, Britain is also striving to expand "conventional" armaments as a "necessary supplement to nuclear armaments."

When British Defense Minister Watkinson defended the British government's policy of arms expansion and war preparations in the British House of Commons, he insisted that increasing military spending was "necessary." Echoing the tone of the United States, he clamored for vigorously developing missiles to "greatly strengthen the West's deterrent power." He also boasted for the United States that this might "ensure that there will be no gap in the (East-West) deterrent power."

Support West German Rearmament

Not only that, when West German militarism's expansionist ambitions are increasingly exposed, Britain continues to support West German rearmament and even directly helps West Germany develop new weapons. The British-West German talks last December decided that the two countries would jointly produce Britain's newly made "Blue Water" missile, prototype tanks, and other weapons. According to recent British newspaper reports, Britain and West Germany are also conducting secret negotiations to discuss the issue of Britain supplying the West German Air Force with "NA-39" jet atomic bombers.

Recently, the British government has been making every effort to defend its policy of supporting West German atomic armament. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said in the British House of Commons in mid-February that "West Germany must obtain the same weapons as other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." British Defense Minister Watkinson also strongly advocated that West Germany possess nuclear weapons. He said that if West Germany is "poorly equipped," it would create a "dangerous loophole in West European defense, and part of this loophole must be filled by Britain increasing its military burden."

When news broke that West Germany was seeking military bases in Spain and other Western European countries, the British authorities, fearing domestic and foreign public opinion, initially tried to cover it up and even expressed "unease" and "opposition." However, a British Foreign Office spokesman finally had to admit that Britain had known about West Germany's request to obtain foreign military bases long in advance. He said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "has discussed this issue, and British representatives participated in the discussion." At the same time, he revealed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has not stipulated "legal" restrictions on its member states' "practices of seeking to build military facilities elsewhere." Subsequently, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also expressed the same attitude in the House of Commons. The matter is not only that. According to Agence France-Presse on March 4, Britain is also negotiating with West Germany, "negotiating on the issue of eventually establishing facilities in Britain to train West German Air Force pilots" and "training West German personnel in the use of certain tactical nuclear weapons." Britain's "Daily Express" also revealed on the same day: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is studying a surprising proposal: to establish German bases in Britain."

Military Expansion Policy Causes Dissatisfaction

The British government's continued policy of arms expansion and war preparations and support for the United States in rearming West Germany is fundamentally contrary to Britain's security and the interests of the British people. Britain's military expenditure for the 1960-61 fiscal year accounts for almost one-third of the national budget, which is an extremely heavy burden on the British people. Calculated based on Britain's population of 50 million, the average four-person household has to pay two pounds and ten shillings per week to support the British government's arms expansion and war preparations.

The recent debate in the British House of Commons on British foreign policy and military policy reflected the dissatisfaction caused by the British government's policies. During the debate, the British Labour Party proposed a motion of no confidence in the government's "defense policy." A group of Labour MPs, regardless of the opposition of the Labour leadership, also separately proposed a motion condemning the government for increasing military spending, opposing the use of nuclear strategy as the basis of British military policy, and demanding a halt to the production of nuclear weapons. One of the Labour MPs, Zilliacus, said in the House of Commons that Britain's real defense policy should be a policy of avoiding major wars. He opposed Britain's policy of supporting West German rearmament. Former Labour government Defense Minister Shinwell expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's current foreign policy of following the United States. He said, "The British government is a stooge helping the United States." Labour MP Crossman also delivered a speech on March 7, accusing Britain's policy of being "so foolish." He said, "We Conservatives bear at least the same responsibility as the Americans," and he also criticized the Labour Party's power holders for "also supporting German rearmament."

The Communist Party of Great Britain firmly opposes the British government's policy, which runs counter to the British people's desire for peace and the trend of the times. Harry Pollitt, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the CPGB, said: "The British people should cooperate with the Russians for peace, not with the Americans for war." He expressed full support for the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. In an editorial commenting on the government's "Defense White Paper," the London "Daily Worker" pointed out that the British government's action of increasing military spending runs counter to the desire of the world's people for complete disarmament. The editorial said that because of the Conservative Party's "defense policy," the danger Britain now faces is "greater than it has ever faced in its history."

For quite some time recently, the British government has repeatedly stated that it will strive to improve East-West relations, promote the settlement of disarmament issues, and ease the situation. After the end of the British general election last October, Macmillan boasted that Britain would "exert... its full strength in the tireless pursuit of peace." However, in contrast to the facts of arms expansion and war preparations shown by the British "Defense White Paper," how can people believe in Britain's sincerity for peace? A commentary in the Soviet "Red Star" believes that the British government's current military policy is to intensify the arms race, accelerate the manufacture of nuclear weapons, and prepare for "major wars" and "minor wars." This policy is completely contrary to the British ruling group's claim that it favors the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

The British "Daily Herald" on February 23 published a cartoon satirizing the huge British military expenditure and the heavy burden on the people. The money-eating barbarian in the picture is labeled "British Defense," and the person in the lower right is calling Chancellor of the Exchequer Heathcoat-Amory. He says: "Defend my home? But he will eat me out of house and home!"

### 英国追随美国加紧扩军备战  英国人民军费负担沉重对政府扩军政策表示不满

    英国追随美国加紧扩军备战
    英国人民军费负担沉重对政府扩军政策表示不满
    本报讯　英国政府正在继续追随美国加紧扩军备战。它在这方面的许多行动最近已引起了英国国内外的注意和反对。
    增加军费发展导弹
    英国政府在2月中旬发表的“国防白皮书”表明，英国将像美国一样大力发展核武器和导弹武器，同时积极改进和扩充“常规”军备。白皮书宣布，英国在1960—1961财政年度内，军事总开支将为十六亿二千九百八十三万英镑，比1959—1960财政年度内军费支出增加一亿一千五百七十万英镑。
    军费中有很大一笔款项将用来发展核武器。白皮书承认，英国政府实行核军备竞赛的“总的防御政策没有重大改变”。它说，英国在发展“蓝光”导弹的同时，正在研究从飞机或潜水艇发射远程核导弹，研究包括各式导弹在内的新武器，并且打算制造核潜水艇。
    白皮书表明，英国除继续积极参加侵略性军事集团外，还特别以维护殖民利益、镇压越来越高涨的民族独立运动为其“国防”政策的指导原则。它说：“英国在北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织、东南亚条约组织中发挥了它的作用，此外，它还派军事部队去帮助维持它负有特殊责任的政治敏感地区（指殖民地）的稳定。”在这样的原则指导下，英国在大力发展核武器的同时，还努力扩充“常规”军备，以作为“对核军备的必要补充。”
    英国国防大臣沃金森在英国下院为英国政府扩军备战政策辩解时，硬说增加军费是“必需的”。他附和美国的调子，叫嚷要大力发展导弹来“大大加强西方的威慑力量”。他并且为美国吹嘘说，这样可能就“有把握不会出现（东西方）威慑力量的差距”。
    支持西德重新武装
    不但如此，当西德军国主义的扩张野心日益毕露的时候，英国还继续支持西德重新武装，甚至直接帮助西德发展新式武器。去年12月英国与西德会谈曾经决定，由两国联合生产英国新制的“蓝水”式导弹、原型坦克和其他武器。据英国报纸最近透露，英国和西德还进行秘密谈判，讨论英国把“NA—39式”喷气式原子轰炸机供应西德空军的问题。
    最近，英国政府竭力为它支持西德原子武装的政策进行辩解。英国外交大臣劳埃德2月中在英国下院说，“北大西洋公约组织其他国家得到什么武器，西德也必须得到同样的武器。”英国国防大臣沃金森也竭力主张西德拥有核武器。他说，如果西德“装备拙劣”，将使“西欧防务发生危险的漏洞，这种漏洞一部分必须由英国增加军事负担来填补”。
    当西德要求在西班牙和其他西欧国家取得军事基地的消息透露出来时，英国官方慑于国内外的舆论，起初还竭力掩饰，甚至表示“不安”与“反对”，但后来英国外交部发言人终于不得不承认，英国早已事先知道了西德要求取得国外军事基地这件事情。他说，北大西洋公约集团“已经讨论了这个问题，英国代表参加了这次讨论”。同时他又透露，北大西洋集团对其成员国“在其他地方谋建军事设施的作法并未规定‘法律’限制”。接着，英国外交大臣劳埃德也在下院表明了同样的态度。事情还不仅如此。据法新社3月4日报道，英国还在跟西德进行谈判，“谈判的问题是，最后在英国建立训练西德空军驾驶员的设施”，以及“训练西德人员使用某些战术核武器”。英国“每日快报”也在同一天透露说：“北大西洋公约组织正在研究一个令人吃惊的建议：在英国建立德国基地”。
    扩军政策引起不满
    英国政府继续扩军备战与支持美国重新武装西德的政策是根本有背于英国的安全和英国人民的利益的。英国1960—61财政年度的军事费用几乎占全国预算的三分之一，这是压在英国人民头上的极其沉重的负担。按英国五千万人口计算，平均每四口之家每周就要付出两英镑十先令来供英国政府扩军备战之用。
    英国议会下院最近关于英国外交政策和军事政策的辩论，反映了英国政府政策所引起的不满。在辩论中，英国工党曾提出了一项对政府“国防政策”的弹劾案。有一批工党议员还不顾工党领导的反对，单独提出了一项提案，谴责政府增加军费，反对以核战略作为英国军事政策的基础，并且要求停止生产核武器。其中的一位工党议员济利亚克斯在下院发言时说，英国真正的国防政策应该是避免发生大战的政策。他反对英国支持西德重新武装的政策。前工党政府国防大臣辛威尔对英国目前追随美国的外交政策表示不满。他说，“英国政府是帮助美国的小丑”。工党议员克罗斯曼也在3月7日发表演说，指责英国的政策是“多么愚蠢”。他说，“我们保守党人至少和美国人负有同样的责任”，他并且批评工党当权派“也支持德国重新武装”。
    英国共产党坚决反对英国政府这种与英国人民和平愿望和时代潮流相违背的政策。英共执行委员会主席波立特说：“英国人应当为了和平而同俄国人合作，而不应当为了战争而同美国人合作。”他表示完全支持苏联政府提出的全面彻底裁军建议。伦敦“工人日报”在评论政府“国防白皮书”的社论中指出，英国政府增加军费的行动是同世界人民要求全面裁军的愿望背道而驰的。社论说，由于保守党的“国防政策”，英国现在所遭到的危险，“比它在历史上任何时候所遭到的都要大”。
    最近相当长一个时期以来，英国政府口口声声表示要为改善东西方关系，促进裁军问题的解决以缓和局势而努力。去年10月英国大选结束以后，麦克米伦曾经吹嘘英国要“在不懈地谋求和平的工作中发挥……全部力量”。但是，在由英国“国防白皮书”所表明的扩军备战的事实对照下，人们怎么能够相信英国的和平诚意呢？苏联“红星报”的一篇评论认为，英国政府目前的军事政策是要加紧军备竞赛，加速制造核武器，准备“大战”和“小战”。这种政策与英国统治集团说什么赞成用和平方法解决国际争端的说法，是完全背道而驰的。
