Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" said today in an international commentary that significant processes continue to develop in vast regions of Latin America. This year, Latin America will commemorate the 150th anniversary of its opposition to Spanish rule. Currently, a second great liberation movement against the rule of foreign monopoly capital and for economic independence is unfolding in this region. Cuba is the banner of this movement.

It is no coincidence that the United States has intensified its activities against Cuba. In the past ten days, American planes have bombed Cuban territory more than once.

"Izvestia" pointed out that the trend of using the combined strength of Latin American countries to solve economic difficulties is becoming increasingly obvious. On February 18, the treaty establishing the "Latin American Free Trade Association" was signed in Montevideo. However, observers point out that the establishment of a free trade area may not be a panacea for curing the economic difficulties of participating countries. American monopoly capital has three billion US dollars in direct investment in the participating countries. American monopoly capital expects that the establishment of a free trade area will allow it to expand its power, which will result in damage to the national economies of Latin American countries. This is why the newly established trade area has not been endorsed by all Latin American countries. Regarding Eisenhower's trip to South America, "Izvestia" commented that it will become clear in the near future how the United States will assess the dominant sentiment in the region in its policy towards South America. Regarding the purpose of this visit, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote that this visit will use money and sweet words as a prescription to cure anti-American sentiment in Latin America. "Izvestia" continued, pointing out that even the American press doubts that such an approach can be successful.

    拉丁美洲掀起伟大的解放运动
    苏联“消息报”指出美国加强反对古巴不是偶然的
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联“消息报”今天在一篇国际述评中说，在拉丁美洲广大地区有意义的进程继续发展着。今年，拉丁美洲将纪念反对西班牙统治一百五十周年。目前，在这个地区，展开了第二次伟大的反对外国垄断资本统治、争取经济独立的解放运动。古巴是这一运动的旗帜。
    美国加强了反对古巴的活动，这不是偶然的。过去十天内，美国飞机不止一次地轰炸了古巴的地区。
    “消息报”指出，现在想用拉丁美洲各国的共同力量来解决经济困难的趋势日益明显。2月18日在蒙得维的亚签订了建立“拉丁美洲自由贸易协会”的条约。但是观察家指出，建立自由贸易区未必能够成为医治参加国经济困难的妙药。美国垄断资本在参加国有三十亿美元的直接投资。美国垄断资本指望建立自由贸易区能够容许它扩张力量，其结果就是损害拉丁美洲国家的民族经济。这就是为什么新成立的贸易区未得到拉丁美洲各国赞同的原因。关于艾森豪威尔南美之行，“消息报”评论指出，在最近的将来就会表明，美国在对待南美洲的政策上将如何估计在这个地区占统治地位的情绪。关于这次访问的目的，“华尔街日报”写道，这次访问将用金钱和甜言蜜语作为药方以医治拉丁美洲的反美情绪。“消息报”接着指出，就是美国的报刊也怀疑这样的作法能够获得成功。
