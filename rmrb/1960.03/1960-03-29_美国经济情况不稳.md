    Unstable US Economic Situation
    Industrial production declines

    The US government announced on the 16th that US industrial production fell in February. The industrial production index for that month was 110 (based on 1957 industrial production levels as 100), compared to 111 in January. The sectors with the largest production declines were the automotive industry, household appliance, and other consumer goods manufacturing. Mining production also fell.

    The US government also announced that in February, total personal income in the US remained at an annual rate of $393 billion, roughly the same level as in January. However, due to the poor performance of the automotive industry, the wage income of US manufacturing workers decreased by $300 million.

    Commenting on the US economic situation on the 17th, the United Press International said, "This week, there are more signs that the US economy is stagnating again. (The above-mentioned) two basic statistical measures confirmed this trend." The news pointed out that the current operating rate of the US steel industry is only 92.9%, compared to 95.5% in January and 94.2% in February. Automotive production is currently 16% lower than at the beginning of this year.

    Coal production decreases

    US coal production continued to decline last year, reaching its lowest level since 1954.

    The main reasons for the decline were the steel strike and decreased exports.

    According to preliminary figures listed in a recent report by the US Bureau of Mines, total US production of bituminous and anthracite coal in 1959 was approximately 429.5 million tons, a decrease of approximately 2 million tons compared to 1958. Anthracite production last year was 19.5 million tons, the lowest figure in recent years.

    Balance of payments deteriorates

    The US Department of Commerce recently released a report on economic activity in 1959. This report shows that the international economic position of the United States further weakened last year, and gold reserves decreased significantly again.

    The report pointed out that the US international balance of payments deficit reached $3.7 billion in 1959, $300 million more than in the severe economic crisis of 1958.

    The report also pointed out that US gold reserves decreased by $1.07 billion last year. Although the degree of reduction was not as great as in 1958, the US Information Service admitted that this was largely due to the British, French, and West German governments repaying debts owed to the United States ahead of schedule. At the same time, the income earned by other countries in transactions with the United States is currently kept in the United States, primarily converted into US government bonds to earn interest, rather than being converted into gold and flowing out.

    Living expenses rise

    Living expenses in the United States rose to a historical peak in February.

    Living expenses rose by two-tenths of one percent between January and February, with medical expenses rising by eight-tenths of one percent, the largest increase in eighteen months.

    The increase in the cost of living brought the US Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index back to 125.6% of the 1947-1949 average index.

    US officials believe that this foreshadows a new gradual rise in consumer goods prices.

### 美国经济情况不稳

    美国经济情况不稳
    工业生产下降
    美国政府16日宣布，美国工业生产在2月份下跌。这一个月的工业生产指数是一百一十（以1957年的工业生产水平为一百），而1月份是一百一十一。生产下跌最多的部门是汽车工业、家庭装置和其他消费品制造业。采矿业的生产也下跌。
    美国政府同时宣布，在2月份，美国全部的个人收入保持年率三千九百三十亿美元的水平，和1月份的水平差不多。但是由于汽车工业情况不佳，美国制造业工人的工资收入减少了三亿美元。
    合众国际社17日在评论美国的经济形势时说，“本星期有更多的迹象说明美国经济再次停滞不前。（美国政府宣布的上述）两个基本统计尺度证实了这个趋势。”消息指出，美国钢铁工业目前的开工率只有92．9％，而1月份是95．5％，2月份是94．2％。汽车工业目前的生产已经比今年年初减少了16％。
    煤产量减少
    美国去年的煤产量继续下降，成为1954年以来最低的产量。
    下降的主要原因是由于钢铁罢工和出口减少。
    根据美国矿务局最近报告中所列举的初步数字，美国1959年烟煤和无烟煤的总产量约为四亿二千九百五十万吨，比1958年减少了二百万吨左右。去年无烟煤的产量为一千九百五十万吨，是几年来最低的数字。
    国际收支恶化
    美国商务部最近发表了关于1959年经济活动的报告。这个报告表明，美国的国际经济地位在去年进一步削弱，黄金储备又大量减少。
    报告指出，美国在1959年的国际收支赤字达到三十七亿美元，比经济危机严重的1958年还多出三亿美元。
    报告还指出，美国去年的黄金储备减少了十亿零七千万美元。减少的程度虽然不如1958年，但是美新处承认，这在很大程度上是由于英、法、西德等国政府提前偿还欠美国的债务，同时，其他国家同美国交易时所获得的收入，目前存留在美国，首先是换成美国政府债券获取利息，而没有换成黄金外流。
    生活费用上涨
    美国2月份的生活费用涨到历史上的最高峰。
    在1月和2月之间生活费用上涨了千分之二，其中医药费用上涨了千分之八，这是十八个月中最大的一次上涨。
    生活费用的增加，使美国劳工部的消费价格指数回升到1947年—1949年平均指数的125．6％。
    美国官员认为，这预示着消费品价格将有一次新的逐步的上升。
