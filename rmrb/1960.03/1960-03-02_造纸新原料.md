    New Raw Materials for Papermaking
    Paper is composed of fibers. China has abundant resources, with many kinds of wild fibers and large yields. Using them for papermaking is an inexhaustible resource. Many wild plants and some industrial and agricultural production wastes have leftover fibers after sugar production and winemaking that can still be used for papermaking.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, papermaking factories in various regions have achieved great success in using wild fibers and industrial and agricultural waste for papermaking. In the past, industrial packaging paper bags mostly used wood and some bamboo as the main raw materials, but now there are more raw materials available. Such as cotton stalks, cotton husks, *Malian* grass, kenaf, *shanhuai* (a type of locust tree). Wild *longxucao* (also known as *suocao* or *shanhuangcao*), in addition to being used as base paper for offset printing paper and thin carbon copy paper, has also been trial-produced into industrial filter paper and insulating paper. Bamboo shoots, corn husks and corn stalks, bean stalks, sorghum stalks, peanut shells, melon vines, and many other agricultural by-products can also be used to manufacture printing paper and writing paper. Red tree bark can also be used to make blue shell paper, replacing steel paper as insulating material. Rice straw was mostly used to make cardboard and general cultural paper in the past, but now it has been trial-produced into high-quality offset printing paper, and a portion of it can also be used to make insulating paperboard. Wild plants such as cattails, *hongmaogong*, *baijiancao*, and *jijicao* are all good raw materials for general packaging and cultural paper. (Zhi Hui)

    造纸新原料
    纸是纤维组成的。我国的资源丰富，野生纤维的种类多而产量大，用来造纸是取之不尽、用之不竭的资源。有许多野生植物和一些工农业生产的废料，在制糖、作酒以后，剩下来的纤维还可以造纸。
    大跃进以来，各地造纸工厂在采用野生纤维和工农业废料造纸方面获得很大的成就。过去工业包装纸袋用纸，大部是用木材及部分竹子作主要原料，现在有了更多的原料可用。如棉秆、棉皮、马连草、牛麻、山槐。野生的龙须草（又名蓑草或山荒草），除用来作胶版印刷纸和薄型的复写纸原纸外，也试制成工业滤纸和绝缘纸。笋壳、玉米壳及玉米秆、豆秆、高粱秆、花生壳、瓜秧等许多农产品的废料，也可用于制造印刷纸、书写纸。红树皮还可以作青壳纸，代替钢纸作绝缘器材。稻草过去大部分是用来作纸板和一般的文化用纸，现在已试制成质量很好的胶版印刷纸，还可以掺用一部分做绝缘纸板。野生植物中的蒲草、红毛公、白尖草、芨芨草等，都是作一般包装、文化用纸的好原料。　（志辉）
