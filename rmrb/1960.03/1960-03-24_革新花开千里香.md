The Scent of Innovation Blossoms Far and Wide

    Automatic Material Feeding Machine for Bricklaying

    Tian Fubi, a technician from the Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine with a worker background, successfully created the material feeding machine, a crucial piece of equipment for rock roadway construction in coal mines. This solves a major key problem of achieving full mechanization of rock roadway bricklaying in coal mines. This automatic material feeding machine is 30% more efficient than manual material handling, saving over 3,650 labor units annually. It not only greatly improves production efficiency but also completely ends the backward history of manual material supply in old Kailuan, characterized by "person next to person, hand to hand, lifting from below, and passing above", thus realizing mechanized material handling.

    Wooden Electric Mine Car

    The technical innovation research group of Jiaolishan Quarry in Haining County, Zhejiang Province, recently successfully trial-produced an "electric mine car" which can increase work efficiency by 24 times, thus saving 20,000 workdays per year.

    This electric mine car is made entirely of waste materials. For example, the tracks are made of wood with a piece of iron sheet on top; the mine car is also wooden, with a motor attached to the front and a wooden frame above serving as a utility pole to connect to the power supply. As long as the button is flipped at one end of the track, the motor starts, pulling the mine car to transport the ore down; flipping another button allows the mine car to automatically return. This mine car can transport about three tons each time, greatly reducing labor intensity.

    Hydraulic Copying Lathe Tool Post

    Faculty and students from the Machine Tool and Cutting Tool Teaching and Research Group of Taiyuan Institute of Technology, in close cooperation with Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, have been intensely tackling scientific frontiers and recently successfully trial-produced a hydraulic copying lathe tool post.

    The hydraulic copying lathe tool post is a compact and independent tool post that can be easily installed on various machine tools, specifically for processing parts with high precision and complex shapes. When using this tool post to process parts, once the first well-processed part is installed, the tool post can automatically copy and process more such parts. This not only greatly reduces the labor intensity of workers but also increases production efficiency by one to three times. A worker can oversee two or three such machine tools.

    Automatic Electrical Calibration Bench for Tape Recorders

    The electrical assembly group of the tape recorder workshop at the Shanghai Recording Equipment Factory recently introduced an automatic electrical calibration bench for tape recorders that is entirely electrically controlled and combines foreign and domestic technologies. Its emergence paves the way for the mechanization and automation of calibration and testing in the manufacturing of telecommunications instruments. Previously, six highly skilled master craftsmen manually inspected the operation of tape recorders at this factory. Now, a common worker can handle the task using the machine. Originally, a calibration master could only calibrate one tape recorder in fourteen minutes. With the automatic calibration bench, it only takes half a minute to calibrate one tape recorder.

    Simple Electric Cart

    Employees of the transportation departments in Shenyang City recently converted ordinary handcarts into simple electric carts, greatly improving transportation efficiency.

    This electric cart can carry 500 kilograms of goods and travel at a speed of ten kilometers per hour, increasing efficiency by at least 85% compared to handcarts. If the horsepower is increased, the load capacity and operating efficiency can be further improved. The operation of this electric cart is very easy; anyone who can ride a tricycle can learn to drive it in a few minutes.

    The emergence of this electric cart opens up a very important avenue for improving the efficiency of urban short-distance transportation. Taking Shenyang City as an example, if all human-powered vehicles in the city were converted into electric carts, its transportation capacity could be increased from an annual output of 28 million tons to 51.8 million tons, equivalent to adding 518 four-ton trucks, while also saving a large amount of manpower.

    No Hands for Counting Tickets, No Walking for Delivery

    Employees of the Qiaotou Street Business Office of the Taiyuan City Branch of the People's Bank of China have, through technical innovation and technical revolution, basically achieved "no hands for counting tickets, no walking for delivery."

    They have successively created and imitated 37 machines and advanced tools, including an electric lever counting ticket machine, a photoelectric counting ticket machine, a ticket bundling machine, a damaged ticket punching machine, a banknote sorting and counting box, a coin counting and packaging lathe, an electric bill nailing machine, a payment and receipt desk, and so on. In terms of cashier work, the counting, bundling, and punching of damaged paper money, as well as the counting, packaging, payment, and change-giving of coins, have basically achieved semi-mechanized operation. The stamping, delivery, and binding of vouchers in accounting work have also been automated. Due to the greatly improved work efficiency, the business office not only saved five employees but also achieved collective error-free operation for ten consecutive months.

    Electronic Automatic Control Metering Instrument

    Employees of the Xiuli Grain and Oil Supply Store in Chaoyang District, Changchun City, Jilin Province, created an "electronic automatic control metering instrument", achieving automated grain and oil sales without the need for scales or lifting. Using this electronic automatic control metering instrument, the accuracy of measurement is 0.5 per mille higher than that of weighing scales, and labor efficiency is twenty times higher. In the past, a strong male salesperson typically paid out 6,400 catties of grain in eight hours (including the time for moving bags and pouring bags), which was very labor-intensive. Now, a female salesperson can operate this instrument and pay out 100,000 catties of grain in eight hours simply by pressing a button.

    Wage Quick Calculator

    Niu Dianchen, a wage clerk at the Changchun City Gas Company, successfully created a wage quick calculator during the technical revolution movement. To calculate wages with this quick calculator, simply know the person's wage grade, working days, etc., and dial the fixed mark on the quick calculator's disc to see the wages due.

    The characteristics of this wage quick calculator are: saving, simplicity, accuracy, and speed. Performing simultaneously with this wage quick calculator, a calculator, and an abacus to calculate the wages of ten workers, the quick calculator took one minute and fifty-eight seconds, the calculator took more than twelve minutes, and the abacus took more than twenty-four minutes.

    革新花开千里香
    砌?自动托料机
    开滦赵各庄矿工人出身的技术员田福毕，创造成功了煤矿岩石巷道的主要设备——托料机，解决了煤矿岩石巷道砌?全面实现机械化的重大关键问题。这台自动托料机比人力托料提高效率30％，全年可以节约三千六百五十多个劳动力，不仅大大提高了生产效率，并彻底结束了旧开滦遗留下来的“人挨人、手递手、下托举、上接传”人力供料的落后历史，实现了托料机械化。
    木制电动矿车
    浙江省海宁县角里山轧石厂技术革新研究小组，最近试制成功了“电动矿车”可以提高工效二十四倍，全年可以因此节约二万个劳动日。
    这台电动矿车全是用废旧料制成的。如轨道是用木材制的，上面加一块铁皮；矿车也是木制的，矿车的前面加一只马达，上面做一个木架做电杆接通电源。只要在轨道的一端掀动一下电钮，马达就开动牵引矿车将矿石运下；另一个电钮一掀；又能使矿车自动回上去。这台矿车每次可运三吨左右，大大减轻了劳动强度。
    液压仿形刀架
    太原工学院机械系机床刀具教研组师生和山西机床厂密切协作，猛攻科学尖端，最近试制成功了液压仿形刀架。
    液压仿形刀架是一种设计很紧凑的独立刀架，可以很方便地装在各种机床上，专门用来加工精度较高、形状很复杂的零件。使用这种刀架加工零件时，只要安装上加工好的第一个零件，这种刀架就能自动地仿形加工出更多这样的零件。这样，不仅可以大大减轻工人的劳动强度，而且可以提高生产效率一倍到三倍。一个工人可以看管两三台这种的机床。
    录音机电工自动校验台
    上海录音器材厂录音机车间电工装配组最近出现了一台完全由电气控制、洋土结合的录音机电工自动校验台。它的出现，为电讯仪表制造的校验、测试走上机械化、自动化开辟了道路。这个厂原来由六个技术较高的老师傅用手工检验录音机的工作，现在已由一个普通工人利用机器担负起来。原来，校验老师傅十四分钟只能校验一台录音机，用自动校验台校验只需半分钟就能校验一台。
    简易电瓶车
    沈阳市交通运输部门职工最近将普通手推车改装成简易电瓶车，大大提高了运输效率。
    这种电瓶车，可以装载五百公斤货物，以每小时十公里的速度前进，最少可比手推车提高效率85％，如果加大马力，还可提高载重量与运行效率。这种电瓶车操纵方法非常容易，会骑三轮车的人，几分钟就能学会驾驶。
    这种电瓶车的出现，给提高城市短途运输效率开辟了一条极重要的途径。以沈阳市为例：如果把全市所有人力车辆都改成电瓶车，它的运输能力就可由年产两千八百万吨提高到五千一百八十万吨，等于增加五百一十八辆四吨的汽车，同时还可以节省大批人力。点票不用手传递不用走
    中国人民银行太原市支行桥头街营业室职工，经过技术革新和技术革命，已经基本做到“点票不用手，传递不用走”。
    他们先后创造和仿制成功机器和先进工具三十七项，其中有电动杠杆报数点票机、光电报数点票机、捆票机、残票打洞机、票币分类计数箱、硬币点包车床、电动钉传票机、收付款办公桌等等。在出纳工作方面，纸币的点数、捆票、残币打洞，硬币的整点、包装、付出、找零，基本上都已实现了半机械化操作；会计工作方面的凭证盖章、凭证传递、凭证装钉，也都实现了自动化。由于工作效率大大提高，营业室不但节省了职工五人，而且连续十个月做到了集体无差错。
    电子自动控制计量仪
    吉林省长春市朝阳区秀丽粮油供应店职工，创造出一台“电子自动控制计量仪”，实现了卖粮不用秤，卖油不用提，售粮售油自动化。使用这台电子自动控制计量仪，计量的准确程度比磅秤高千分之五，劳动效率高二十倍。过去，一个身强力壮的男营业员，一般八小时内付粮六千四百斤（包括搬袋、倒袋时间），劳动强度很大。现在，一个女营业员操纵这台仪器，只需按电钮，八小时可以付十万斤粮。
    工资速算器
    长春市煤气公司工资员牛殿臣，在技术革命运动中，创造成功一种工资速算器。用这种速算器计算工资，只要知道那个人的工资等级、工作日数等，拨动速算器圆盘上固定的标记，就可以看出应得的工资。
    这种工资速算器的特点是：省、简、准、快。用这种工资速算器和计算器、算盘同时表演，计算十名工人的工资，使用速算器用一分五十八秒，计算器用十二分多，算盘则用了二十四分多钟。（附图片）
    北京周口店采石厂工人创造了一种加工花岗石料的剁斧机。用这种剁斧机，比手工工效提高十几倍，并且大大地减轻了工人的劳动强度　应哲摄（新华社稿）
