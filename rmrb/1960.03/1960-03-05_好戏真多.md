Title: Many Good Shows

This is truly a blossoming of a hundred flowers!

In the past, when we heard that a theatrical troupe was coming from another place, we would always inquire: Is this troupe any good? Are there any famous actors, any signature plays?

Now, there's no need for that! No matter where a troupe comes from, it's sure to have wonderful plays that will amaze people!

My words are not an exaggeration. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom is encouraging all theatrical workers across the country! There is no place or troupe that is not blooming, that's the truth!

Yesterday I watched the Old Tune Opera Troupe from Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province perform "Pan Yang Lawsuit." Another good play!

The content of this play is not new. We all know it, it's about transferring Kou Zhun and interrogating Pan Hong at night.

But, first look at this Pan Hong! I've seen this old villain in many different types of opera! This time, however, I saw a Pan Hong who deserved a hundred points. His image is good, truly like a great villain! His every movement has a psychological basis, allowing us to see his treacherous and filthy heart in every gesture. Alas, it's really uncomfortable to be a bad person, even a cough from someone else makes him shudder!

The actor who plays Pan Hong is the old artist Comrade Cui ChengTian, a Communist Party member. I hope that the painted-face actors in Peking Opera will learn from this old comrade, he truly has real skill!

The actors playing Kou Zhun, She Taijun, Yang Liulang, Hu Pixian, and Zhao Defang are all young actors, capable of both acting and singing. They sing really well. The singing style of Old Tune is similar to Hebei Bangzi, but it has this advantage: although it is high-pitched, it is not tense, because the ends of the sentences often go to low notes, combining high pitch with depth. Even the actress playing Yang Qilang's wife, Du Jin'e, and the emperor, empress, as well as the Eighth and Ninth Sisters, were all very dedicated. The roles are well-matched, neat and tidy, making people feel comfortable!

In terms of the play itself, the first two scenes are the most outstanding, full of contradictions, not a single word is wasted. These two scenes are quite long, but the audience seems to be holding their breath and listening attentively, for fear of missing a word or a bit of expression. That's what I call a play!

The events take place after the death of the old commander and Yang Qilang. The Yang family has already heard the bad news, but the emperor doesn't know yet. Therefore, the Yang family celebrates the old commander's birthday in order to await the arrival of the imperial carriage and file a complaint. The saddest thing is placed in a scene filled with brightly lit birthday candles, fragrant flowers, and warm wine, the play begins with this! The birthday hall is even more tragic than a mourning hall!

However, I feel that the third, fourth, and fifth scenes seem a bit too long, a bit dragging. A slight reduction would avoid this drawback. More importantly, Kou Zhun's image should be made more distinct. The play only emphasizes his wit, and his feelings of love for loyalty and hatred for the treacherous do not seem to be expressed enough. I hope to see a Kou Zhun who is frank and upright, and hates evil as his enemy!

It can be seen that the director has indeed put a lot of effort into this play. Take the division of scenes, for example, a neat and tidy six scenes, with the interlude scenes reduced as much as possible. This is almost the technique of spoken drama, but it still looks like a traditional play, without hindering the entrances and exits, etc.—I am really afraid of seeing the young male lead's pheasant feathers touching the second curtain, or the big painted-face actor being squeezed to the edge of the stage, not even daring to lift his legs. A careful arrangement can achieve the wonders of spoken drama, making it more compact and focused, without damaging the traditional performance techniques.

Sincerely wish the Old Tune Opera Troupe of Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, to put politics in command and continue to leap forward! As for the small opinions I have raised, they are just things that occurred to me at the moment, and may not be correct. Please don't rush to revise the script, wait until more opinions are collected before deciding what to adopt and what to discard.

    好戏真多
    老舍
    这真是百花齐放！
    在从前，一听说由外地来了个戏曲团体，我们总要打听一下：这个剧团好吗？有什么名角，有什么拿手好戏？
    现在，不用费那个事！不管是由哪里来的剧团，准有使人惊叹的好戏！
    我的话并不夸大。百花齐放的方针鼓舞着全国所有的戏曲工作者呀！没有不开花的地方或剧团，这是实话！
    昨天看了河北省保定专区老调剧团的“潘杨讼”。又是一出好戏！
    这出戏的内容并不新奇，咱们都知道，就是调寇准，夜审潘洪啊。
    可是，首先看看这位潘洪吧！我看过不少剧种中的这个老奸贼啦！这回呀，我却看见了一个应得一百分的潘洪。他的形象好，真像巨奸！他的每一动作都有心理的根据，叫我们看见他的一抬手一动脚也就看见他的险诈肮脏的心。哎呀，作坏人真不舒服，连别人咳嗽一声，他都毛骨悚然！
    扮演潘洪的是老艺人崔澄田同志，共产党员。我希望京剧界的花脸要向这位老同志学学，他真有真本领！
    扮寇准的，佘太君的，杨六郎的，呼丕显的，赵德芳的都是青年演员，都能做能唱。唱的真好听。老调的唱腔与河北梆子接近，可是有这么个好处：虽然高亢，可不剑拔弩张，因为句尾多走低音，高亢与深厚兼而有之。连扮杨七郎太太杜金娥的，和皇帝皇后，以及八姐九妹的都很尽职。角色配搭的好，整整齐齐，叫人看着舒服！
    以戏而论，第一二两场最为出色，处处有矛盾，一语不空发。这两场相当长，可是观众似乎都屏息静听，唯恐忽略了一个字或一点点表情。这才叫戏！
    事情发生在老令公与杨七郎死后。杨家已闻噩耗，可是皇帝还不晓得。所以杨家为老令公庆寿，以便御驾到来，好告状。最悲的事却放在寿烛高燃，花香酒暖的场面中，一开幕戏就来了！寿堂比灵堂还更惨！
    可是，我觉得第三、四、五那三场似乎稍多了一些，有点拖。稍加缩减，即免此弊。更要紧的倒是应使寇准的形象更鲜明一些。剧中只强调了他的机智，对他的爱忠恨奸的情感似乎表现得还不大够。我希望看见个肝胆照人，嫉恶如仇的寇准！
    看得出来，此剧在导演上的确费了一番工夫。就拿分场说吧，齐齐整整的六场，尽量删减了过场戏。这已近乎话剧的手法，可是看起来仍旧是传统的戏，没有使上下场的亮相儿等等遇到障碍——我真怕看小生的雉尾碰到二道幕上，或大花脸被挤到台边上，连腿都不敢抬起来，细细地安排一下，是可以取得话剧的妙处，更紧凑集中，而无损于传统的表演技法的。
    谨祝河北省保定专区老调剧团政治挂帅，继续跃进！至于我提出的那点小意见，不过是一时想起来的，未必正确，请别忙着动手修改剧本，等意见搜集多了再决定去取吧。
