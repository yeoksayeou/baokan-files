Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 5th: Guangdong Province's salt industry workers have completed the first quarter's crude salt production plan ahead of schedule. In February alone, the province produced more than 104,000 tons of salt, an increase of more than five times compared to the same period last year.

Since February, Guangdong's salt fields have seized favorable opportunities and vigorously launched a mass movement to increase crude salt production. In Zhanjiang Prefecture, a major producing area, most of the salt industry cadres have gone to the front line of production and labored alongside salt workers and salt farmers. The Liangyang Salt Field workers proposed "Strive for a daily output of 1,000 tons of salt" as their goal; the Dianbai Salt Field workers launched a movement of "Daily production of 1,000 tons of salt, 10,000 cubic meters of brine, and the opening of 13,000 mu for drying." Both of these salt fields completed their first quarter production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets.

All salt fields have vigorously carried out technological innovation movements centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. In the Xiangzhou, Dongchong, and Baishahu work areas of the Haifeng Salt Field, the removal of bitter brine used to be done by manual labor. Now it has been realized through pipelines, increasing work efficiency tenfold. The workers of the Liangyang Salt Field created and promoted semi-mechanized salt scraping machines and single-leg windmills. The former increased work efficiency fourfold, and the latter can rotate even in first-level wind, replacing four workers in pumping water.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 5th: Employees of all ethnic groups and farmers and herdsmen who mine alkali in the alkali lakes of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, such as in the Ikzhao and Xilingol grasslands, have completed the first quarter's natural alkali production plan more than a month ahead of schedule. From New Year's Day to the end of February this year, the region has mined 450,000 tons of various natural alkalis, an increase of three and a half times compared to the same period last year. The natural alkali mined in Inner Mongolia this year will continue to be supplied to factories and enterprises in more than 20 provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Shanghai, Hebei, and Liaoning. In order to provide more, better, and cheaper chemical raw materials to fraternal regions, alkali plants in various parts of the autonomous region are doing their best to first process and refine the natural alkali accumulated on the shores of the alkali lakes, and then pack and transport it out steadily. Refined soda ash is an important raw material for industries such as steel, petroleum, glass, paper making, soap, and food.

At present, the climate in the western grasslands of Inner Mongolia is gradually warming, and parts of the alkali lake surfaces are beginning to thaw. The peak alkali mining season in the first half of the year is coming to an end, and various localities are strengthening the storage and transportation of the mined alkali, striving to quickly produce soda ash and transport it to various regions.

    广东盐场  内蒙古碱湖第一季度生产报捷
    新华社广州5日电　广东省盐业职工提前完成了第一季度原盐生产计划。仅2月份，全省就产盐十万四千多吨，比去年同期增长五倍多。
    2月份以来，广东各盐场抓紧有利时机，大力开展增产原盐的群众运动。主要产区湛江专区，大部分盐业干部都走上生产第一线，同盐工盐民一起劳动。两阳盐场职工提出“力争日产千吨盐”，作为奋斗目标；电白盐场职工开展了“日产千吨盐、万方滷、开晒万三千亩”的运动。这两个盐场都提前超额完成了第一季度生产计划。
    各盐场都大力开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新运动。海丰盐场的香洲、东冲、白沙湖等三个工区，过去拆苦滷用人力挑，现在实现管道化，使工效提高了十倍。两阳盐场职工创造和推广半机械化的扒盐机和独脚风车，前者提高工效四倍，后者在一级风力的情况下即能转动，可以代替四个工人扬水。
    新华社呼和浩特5日电　在内蒙古自治区伊克昭、锡林郭勒等草原碱湖上采碱的各民族职工和农牧民，提前一个多月完成了第一季度天然碱的生产计划。从今年元旦到2月末，全区已经开采出各种天然碱四十五万吨，比去年同期产量增加三倍半。内蒙古今年开采的天然碱，将继续供应广东、上海、河北、辽宁等二十多个省市工厂企业使用。自治区各地制碱厂为使各兄弟地区得到更多更好更便宜的化工原料，尽力先把堆积在碱湖岸上的天然碱加工精制，源源打包外运。经过精制后的纯碱，是钢铁、石油、玻璃、造纸、肥皂、食品等工业的重要原料。
    目前，内蒙古西部草原气候日渐转暖，碱湖湖面部分开始解冻，上半年采碱旺季即将结束，各地正加强对已采碱的保管、运输工作，争取尽快地制成纯碱，运往各地。
