Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka sharply questioned Nobusuke Kishi at a meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee on the 5th, strongly condemning the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet for adopting a policy hostile to China, signing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and dragging Japan onto the dangerous road to war.

The JCP's organ "Akahata" today reported in detail on the front page about Sanzo Nosaka's questioning of Nobusuke Kishi.

Nosaka first discussed the trend of the international situation towards détente, and gave examples to prove the peaceful policies of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. He emphasized that adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and adopting a neutral policy is the only way for the Japanese nation to move towards independence and peace.

Sanzo Nosaka emphasized that China adheres to the Three Principles on Japan (referring to the requirements that the Japanese government not be hostile to China, not participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and not hinder the normalization of Japan-China diplomatic relations), and has consistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship towards the Japanese people. China proposed the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression, economic, cultural and all aspects of exchanges, and also released Japanese war criminals and repatriated Japanese residents in China, all of which are in line with the interests of the Japanese people and contribute to easing the tense situation. Nosaka questioned why Nobusuke Kishi should adopt a hostile policy towards such a China.

Nobusuke Kishi stammered in response to the inquiry, and dared not answer directly.

Nosaka emphasized that Nobusuke Kishi, as a member of the Tojo cabinet and a war criminal, should have sincerely atoned to the Chinese people for the crimes he committed against them.

Nosaka strongly condemned Nobusuke Kishi for not only failing to do so, but also openly encouraging the Chiang Kai-shek group to "counterattack the mainland," and further signing a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union.

Nosaka pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of concluding a new "Security Treaty" will only make Japan more subordinate to the United States, and put Japan in a more isolated position in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in his reply at the meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee today, once again exposed his hostility towards the Chinese people and his active participation in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

When answering Socialist Party member Shozaburo Araki, Nobusuke Kishi, disregarding the international agreements of the Potsdam Proclamation and the Cairo Declaration that clearly stipulated the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China, nonsensically said: "The Treaty of San Francisco (with Japan) did not stipulate that Taiwan should be handed over to China," and "The issue of the ownership of Taiwan will ultimately be decided by the countries participating in the treaty."

Araki asked: Taiwan is a part of China, doesn't Nobusuke Kishi think that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair?

Kishi actually said, "The relationship between Taiwan and mainland China, as a matter of territorial sovereignty, also has elements of an internal affair," but to solve it "requires international adjustment."

Nobusuke Kishi also made a blatant statement at the meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee yesterday, saying: "It is impossible to solve the problem by treating the Taiwan issue as an internal affair of China and letting the two parties deal with it." He also used the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, under the manipulation of the United States, still occupies China's seat in the United Nations as an excuse, insisting that the Taiwan issue "can only be resolved with the United Nations as the center, and there is no other way."

Araki pressed Kishi on whether he wanted to recognize "two Chinas?" Kishi did not dare to answer the question directly. However, when answering a question from Socialist Party member Kohei Kobayashi, he admitted the fact that he was hostile to New China and actively participated in the creation of "two Chinas." He said that resolving the issue of the ownership of Jinmen and Mazu Islands involves the issue of "two governments." Because Japan recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek group, it believes that Jinmen and Mazu Islands should belong to the Taiwan "government."

Socialist Party members also pressed Kishi on why he expressed his support for the Chiang Kai-shek group's "counterattack the mainland" when he visited Taiwan three years ago? Faced with the facts, Kishi had to be vague and prevaricate.

    日共主席野坂参三
    强烈谴责岸信介政府敌视中国政策
    岸信介公然叫嚣台湾问题不是中国内政
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三5日在参议院预算委员会会议上对岸信介提出尖锐质询，强烈谴责岸信介内阁采取敌视中国的政策，签订日美军事同盟条约，把日本拖上了战争的危险道路。
    日共机关报“赤旗报”今天在头版详细报道了野坂参三质询岸信介的情况。
    野坂首先论述了趋向缓和的国际形势，并且举例证明以苏联为首的各社会主义国家的和平政策。他强调指出，遵守和平共处五项原则，采取中立政策，是日本民族走向独立和和平的唯一道路。
    野坂参三强调指出，中国坚持对日三项原则（指要求日本政府不敌视中国、不参与制造“两个中国”阴谋、不阻碍日中邦交的正常化），一贯对日本人民执行和平友好的政策。中国建议缔结互不侵犯条约，进行经济、文化和各方面的往来，还释放了日本战犯，遣送了在华日侨，这一切都和日本人民的利益一致，同时对缓和紧张局势作出了贡献。野坂质问岸信介为什么要对这样的中国采取敌视政策。
    岸信介在答复质询时支吾其词，不敢正面答复。
    野坂强调指出，作为东条内阁的阁员和战犯的岸信介，原应该以诚恳的态度就他对中国人民所犯下的罪恶向中国人民赎罪。
    野坂强烈谴责岸信介不仅没有这样做，反而公开鼓励蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”，并且进一步签订了以中苏为敌的新日美“安全条约”。
    野坂指出，岸信介内阁缔结新“安全条约”的政策，只能使日本更加从属于美国，使日本在亚洲和世界上处于更加孤立的地位。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在参议院预算委员会会议答辩中，再次暴露了他敌视中国人民和积极参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    岸信介在回答社会党议员荒木正三郎时，悍然不顾波茨坦公告和开罗宣言明文规定台湾和澎湖列岛归还给中国的国际协定，胡说：“在旧金山（对日）和约中没有约定要把台湾交给中国”，“关于台湾的归属问题，最后将由参加和约的国家决定”。
    荒木问道：台湾是中国的一部分，难道岸信介不认为台湾是中国的内政问题吗？
    岸信介竟然说，“台湾和中国大陆的关系作为领土主权的问题来说，也有内政问题的成分”，但是要解决“就需要在国际上进行调整”。
    岸信介昨天还在参议院预算委员会会议上大放厥词说：“把台湾问题作为中国的一个内政问题，任由两个当事者去处理，是不能解决问题的”。他还以在美国操纵下台湾蒋介石集团仍然窃据着联合国中的中国席位为借口，硬说台湾问题“除了以联合国为中心去解决以外，再没有别的办法”。
  荒木追问岸信介是否要承认“两个中国”？岸信介未敢正面回答问题。但是随后在回答社会党议员小林孝平的质询时，却承认了他敌视新中国，积极参与制造“两个中国”的事实。他说，在解决金门和马祖岛的归属问题时，是涉及“两个政府”的问题。日本由于承认了蒋介石集团，因此它认为金门和马祖岛应该属于台湾“政府”。
    社会党议员还追问岸信介三年前访问台湾时为什么表示要支持蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”？岸信介在事实面前不得不含糊其词，推诿搪塞。
