    Re-examining Communist Style
    Not long ago, we discussed the issue of promoting the communist style of rich teams helping poor teams in the movement of poor teams catching up with rich teams. Today, we will discuss another aspect of the communist style, which is that poor teams must have the spirit of self-reliance and daring to think and act to catch up with rich teams.
    The communist style of daring to think and act is an inexhaustible source of motivation for progress. With this style, people dare to aim for high standards and dare to choose the strongest opponents as their competitors. With this style, people can be far-sighted, fully utilize the spirit of continuous revolution, and stride forward. They will neither be arrogant and complacent because of some achievements already made, relaxing the pace of progress; nor will they lose confidence and shrink back due to temporary difficulties. With this style, people can fully exert their subjective initiative, make every effort to tap potential, take measures, and work tirelessly to realize their determination. Tangxingzhuang Management Area of Jicun People's Commune in Fenyang, Shanxi Province, is a typical example of having this style, determined to catch up with the wealthiest Nanpu Management Area in the locality this year. Last year, they targeted Nanpu Management Area as their benchmark. After a year of hard work, although there are still some differences in production and living standards compared with Nanpu, they have increased by about 30% compared with 1958. The average income of commune members reached eighty-five yuan, equivalent to the average level of the rich teams in the county a year ago. Now, they are neither satisfied with this nor discouraged by not having fully caught up with Nanpu. Instead, they strive to continue to improve on the basis of already greatly improved conditions, eliminating the only remaining differences with Nanpu. They not only have the determination to catch up with Nanpu, but also the means to do so. In response to the weak links in their work last year, they have taken corresponding measures. After continuous efforts since last winter, they have started this year's spring plowing production forty days earlier than in the past, making a good start. It can be expected that as long as they persist in their efforts, they will surely reach new heights this year and enter the ranks of rich teams.
    Self-reliance, striving for progress, and external support and assistance complementing each other can achieve greater results. However, self-reliance plays a leading role. Chairman Mao said long ago in "On Contradiction": "Materialist dialectics holds that external causes are the condition of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes." This is a universally applicable truth. For a poor team to catch up with a rich team, it must overcome numerous difficulties in its path. As long as the poor team has enough confidence and drive, these difficulties can be overcome through hard struggle. If the poor team itself cannot muster its energy and tap its internal potential, it is impossible to change the face of poverty by relying solely on external assistance. For example, if the soil quality of a poor team is poor, to change it, it is necessary to rely first on the commune members to exert their energy and vigorously carry out farmland capital construction such as soil improvement, increased fertilizer application, water conservancy, and flood control. This is the fundamental solution. If one only relies on the state and rich teams for assistance in machinery, labor, and other aspects, without carrying out these works themselves, then, despite the great assistance, the poor condition of the land cannot be fundamentally changed. Therefore, if a poor team wants to completely change its poor face and quickly catch up with the rich team, it must first have the determination and drive to strive for the upstream, promote the communist style of daring to think and act, and strive for the support of the state and the commune, in order to catch up with the rich team like Tangxingzhuang.

### 再谈共产主义风格

    再谈共产主义风格
    不久前我们谈了在穷队赶富队的运动中，要发扬富队帮穷队的共产主义风格问题。今天再谈一谈共产主义风格的另一方面表现，那就是穷队要有自力更生赶上富队的敢想敢干精神。
    敢想敢干的共产主义风格，是获取前进动力的无尽源泉。有了这种风格，人们就敢于向高标准看齐，敢于找最强的对手作为自己的竞赛对象。有了这种风格，人们就能够高瞻远瞩，充分运用不断革命的精神，阔步前进。既不会因为已经获得的一些成就而骄傲自满，放松前进的步伐；也不会因一时困难而丧失信心，畏缩不前。有了这种风格，人们就能充分发挥主观能动作用，千方百计地挖掘潜力、采取措施，为实现自己的决心而努力不懈。山西汾阳冀村人民公社唐兴庄管理区，决心在今年赶上当地最富裕的南浦管理区，就是具有这种风格的典型事例之一。他们去年就以南浦管理区为追赶对象，经过一年的努力，生产和生活水平虽然和南浦还有一些差别，但比1958年却已提高了30％左右。社员平均收入达到八十五元，相当于一年前的全县富队平均水平。现在，他们既不以此为满足，也不因没有完全赶上南浦泄了气，而是力争在已经大大提高的基础上继续提高，消灭和南浦仅有的差别。他们不仅有追上南浦的决心，还有追上南浦的办法。他们针对去年工作中的薄弱环节，采取了相应的措施，经过去冬以来的不断努力，已使今年的春耕生产比过去提前四十天开始活动，打响了开头第一炮。可以预期，只要他们坚持不懈地努力下去，今年一定能够再攀高峰，进入富队行列。
    自力更生，发奋图强，和外界的支援帮助互相配合，可以相得益彰，发挥更大的作用。但是，起主导作用的还是自力更生。毛主席在“矛盾论”中早就说过：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用”。这是放之四海而皆准的真理。一个穷队要赶上富队，必然要克服前进途中的重重困难。只要穷队信心足、干劲大，经过一番艰苦奋斗，这些困难也是可以克服的。如果穷队本身不能鼓起干劲，挖掘内部潜力，单靠外援，那是不可能改变贫穷面貌的。例如穷队的土质不好，要改变它，首先要依靠社员发挥干劲，大力进行改良土壤、多施肥料、兴水利、除水害等农田基本建设工作，这是根本的办法。如果只依赖国家和富队在机器、劳力和其他方面的援助，而自己并不进行这些工作，那末，尽管这种援助是很大的，也不能根本改变土地不良的情况。因此，穷队要想彻底改变贫穷面貌，迅速赶上富队，首先必须自己具有力争上游的决心和干劲，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，并争取国家和公社的支援，才能像唐兴庄那样大步赶上富队。
