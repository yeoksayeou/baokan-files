Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 19th: Nearly five million Japanese workers and people from other social strata simultaneously launched the thirteenth nationwide unified action against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" today across the country.

This is the largest mass movement in terms of participation since Japan launched its first nationwide unified action on April 15th last year. Assemblies were held in more than 600 locations nationwide. Japanese workers, who are currently engaged in the spring struggle demanding wage increases and opposing layoffs, also joined this action, with many workers holding workplace meetings.

Four thousand representatives from prefectural-level joint struggle organizations from all over the country arrived in Tokyo today, carrying signature books collected from various places against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty". Accompanied by Communist Party member of parliament Masao Iwama, Socialist Party member of parliament Isamu Akamatsu, Secretary-General of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" Kozo Minakuchi, and Standing Director of the Japan Peace Committee Toru Kobayashi, they went to the Diet to lodge a serious protest against the Liberal Democratic Party's attempt to force the Diet to ratify the new "Security Treaty". They demanded that the Japanese authorities listen to the social opinion against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty".

A "National Rally to Stop the Ratification of the New Security Treaty, Demand the Dissolution of the Diet, and Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet" was held in Tokyo this afternoon, with 50,000 people participating. After the meeting, participants held a demonstration.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 19th: "Democratic Korea" today published a commentary supporting the Japanese people's thirteenth unified action launched today against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" by the Japanese Diet.

The commentary said, "The Japanese people's heroic struggle for independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy is a just struggle, and it is by no means isolated. All the people of Asia and all peace-loving people of the world stand on the side of the Japanese people."

The commentary said that the United States has recently emphasized strengthening military "aid" to Japan, which blatantly confirms the U.S. imperialists' plan to revive and rearm Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a military base for aggression against Asia.

The commentary said that this provocative conspiracy of U.S. imperialism under the guise of "peace" is the root cause of escalating tensions in the Far East and the world, and a serious threat to peace in the Far East. Under this situation, the new military treaty will not only fail to guarantee Japan's security, but will also drag Japan into a new war, bringing incalculable disasters to the Japanese people.

The commentary said that the Korean people strongly advocate that for the peace and security of the Far East, the U.S. military must withdraw from all Asian regions, including South Korea and Japan, dismantle the U.S. military bases in these regions, and establish a nuclear-free peace zone in Asia; and actively support and aid the struggle of the Japanese people.

On the 18th, the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, the Korean Committee for Asian-African solidarity, the Central Committee for the Korean Democratic Youth League, and the Central Committee for the Korean Democratic Women's League respectively sent telegrams to relevant organizations in Japan, supporting the Japanese people's thirteenth unified action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty".

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 19th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published an article supporting the Japanese people's thirteenth nationwide unified action against the new U.S.-Japan military treaty.

The article pointed out that the Japanese people's opposition to the new U.S.-Japan military treaty is part of the broader struggle of the people of Asia and the world for disarmament, the elimination of the Cold War, and so on. The new U.S.-Japan military treaty is not only intended to maintain U.S. imperialism's occupation and enslavement of Japan, but also an instrument for U.S. imperialism to launch aggressive wars in Asia and undermine peace in Asia and the world. The United States' shipment of atomic weapons and rockets to Japan, the launch of "Matador" missiles in South Korea, and its preparation with West Germany and Japanese militarism to establish a "Washington-Bonn-Tokyo axis" are extremely dangerous steps by U.S. warmongers to threaten peace, in connection with the U.S.-Japan military treaty.

The article said that the people of Asia, including the Vietnamese people, as victims of Japanese militarism in the Second World War, cannot sit idly by while Japanese monopoly capital conspires to use the U.S.-Japan military treaty to revive militarism and expand its power to Asian countries. The people of Asia consider the new U.S.-Japan military treaty as a blatant provocation. The people of Asia fully sympathize with and fully support the unremitting and heroic struggle of the Japanese working class and people.

The article said that the Vietnamese people are closely united with the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world, resolutely oppose the new U.S.-Japan military treaty, and are determined to fight to defeat the U.S. imperialist and Japanese imperialist conspiracies of aggression and challenge.

### 展开反对批准新日美“安全条约”第十三次统一行动  五百万日本人民一齐斗争

    展开反对批准新日美“安全条约”第十三次统一行动
    五百万日本人民一齐斗争
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：近五百万日本工人和其它阶层的人民今天在全国各地同时展开了反对批准新日美“安全条约”第十三次全国统一行动。
    这是日本自从去年4月15日展开第一次全国统一行动以来参加人数最多的一次群众运动。全国有六百多处举行了集会。正在展开要求提高工资和反对解雇的春季斗争的日本工人同时投入这一行动，许多工人举行了工作场所大会。
    来自全国各地的县一级共同斗争组织的代表四千人今天带着从各地征集来的反对批准新“安全条约”的签名簿赶到东京。他们在共产党议员岩间正男、社会党议员赤松勇、阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三和日本和平委员会常任理事小林彻的陪同下前往国会，就自由民主党要强使国会批准新“安全条约”问题提出严重抗议。他们要求日本当局倾听反对批准新“安全条约”的社会舆论。
    东京在今天下午举行了有五万人参加的“阻止批准新安全条约、要求解散国会、打倒岸信介内阁国民大会”。参加大会的人在会后举行了示威游行。
    新华社平壤19日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，支持日本人民为反对日本国会批准新的日美“安全条约”而在今天所展开的第十三次统一行动。
    评论说，“日本人民为争取独立、和平、中立、民主的英勇斗争，是正义的斗争，它决不是孤立的。全体亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都站在日本人民这一边。”
    评论说，美国最近又强调要加强对日本的军事“援助”，这露骨地证实了美帝国主义想复活和重新武装日本军国主义、并把日本变成侵略亚洲的军事基地的计划。
    评论说，美帝国主义戴着“和平”的假面具进行的这种挑衅阴谋，是加剧远东和世界紧张局势的根源，也是对远东和平的严重的威胁。在这种局势下，新的军事条约不仅不能保证日本的安全，而且会使日本卷入新的战争，将给日本人民带来不可估量的灾难。
  评论说，朝鲜人民强烈主张：为了远东的和平和安全，美军必须从包括南朝鲜和日本在内的一切亚洲地区撤走，撤除这些地区内的美军基地，建立亚洲无原子武器的和平地区；并积极支持和声援日本人民的斗争。
    18日，朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会、朝鲜亚非团结委员会、朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会和朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会分别打电报给日本各有关组织，支持日本人民为反对批准新“安全条约”而举行第十三次统一行动。
    新华社河内19日电　越南“人民报”今天发表文章，支持日本人民展开反对日美新军事条约的第十三次全国统一行动。
    文章指出，日本人民反对新的日美军事条约是亚洲和全世界人民目前要求裁军、消除冷战等广泛斗争的一部分。新的日美军事条约不仅为了维持美帝国主义对日本的占领和奴役，而且还是美帝国主义在亚洲发动侵略战争，破坏亚洲和世界和平的一个工具。美国向日本运进原子武器和火箭，在南朝鲜发射“斗牛士”式导弹以及它同西德、日本军国主义准备成立“华盛顿—波恩—东京轴心”等事件同日美军事条约是美国好战分子威胁和平的极其危险的步骤。
    文章说，作为日本军国主义在第二次世界大战的受害者的亚洲人民，包括越南人民，决不能坐视日本垄断资本阴谋利用日美军事条约来复活军国主义和把它们的势力扩张到亚洲各国去。亚洲人民认为新的日美军事条约是明目张胆的挑衅。亚洲人民完全同情和全力支持日本工人阶级和人民的不懈的英勇的斗争。
    文章说，越南人民同日本人民、亚洲人民和世界人民紧密地团结在一起，坚决反对新的日美军事条约，坚决为击败美帝国主义和日本帝国主义的侵略和挑战阴谋而斗争。（附图片）
