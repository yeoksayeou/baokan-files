Adding Trace Elements Can Promote Pig Growth; Effective Remedies Discovered for Grape Phylloxera

According to the Soviet magazine "Pig Breeding," in some areas, the content of trace elements in soil and natural water is not high. Adding a small amount of trace elements to pig feed can promote pig development.

The Soviet collective farms "New Life" and "Path to Communism" recently conducted experiments in this area. The results showed that adding cobalt chloride, copper sulfate, or potassium iodide increased pig weight gain by 16%, 18%, and 9% respectively compared to using ordinary feed. Adding all three trace elements simultaneously increased weight gain by 23% to 25%. In terms of sow pregnancy experiments, sows fed trace elements averaged 8.1 piglets per litter, while those not fed trace elements averaged 6.3 piglets.

The magazine pointed out that adding trace elements cannot replace feed, and rational feeding should still be the focus of pig farming.

The Soviet Institute of Fertilizers and Insecticides and Moscow University recently jointly extracted a new chemical agent for controlling grape phylloxera – diethylene perchlorate. Trials of this agent in Soviet Moldova and other regions have proven that using a small amount of this new agent (three-quarters less than dichloroethane) can completely eliminate grape phylloxera.

For nearly a century, grape growers around the world have waged a tenacious struggle against grape phylloxera – the most dangerous pest of vineyards – but without success. In the last twenty-five to thirty years, this pest has destroyed nearly six million hectares of vineyards! A long time ago, many countries promised to award huge bonuses to those who invented an effective drug to control grape phylloxera. However, no one has received this bonus so far.

The new drug invented in the Soviet Union is effective for more than two years. Natural gas, associated gas, or gas from petroleum factories and chlorine can be used as raw materials for the production of this drug. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached image)

A new reed harvester has been produced in the Soviet Union that can harvest reeds on riverbanks, in lakes, and in swampy areas, and can automatically bundle the harvested reeds. When harvesting reeds on ice and frozen ground, it is towed by a tractor and can harvest three and a half to four and a half tons of reeds up to eight meters high per hour. When used on muddy ground, special tracks are added to the wheels, and the harvesting speed is from two kilometers to fifteen kilometers per hour. The picture above shows the new reed harvester.

    加喂微量元素可促进猪的生长  防治葡萄顽症已获得良药妙方
    据苏联“养猪业”杂志报道，有些地区，土壤和天然水中微量元素含量不多，如在猪饲料中增加少量微量元素，就可以促进猪的发育。
    苏联“新生活”和“共产主义之路”集体农庄最近进行了这方面的试验。结果是，加喂氯化钴、硫酸铜或碘化钾，猪的增重比使用普通饲料分别高出16％、18％和9％。而同时加喂三种微量元素，则增重高出23％到25％。在母猪怀孕试验方面，加喂微量元素的母猪平均一胎产八点一只仔猪，不加喂的产六点三只。
    杂志指出，加喂微量元素并不能代替饲料，合理饲养仍应是养猪业注意中心。

    苏联肥料与杀虫剂科学研究所和莫斯科大学前不久共同提炼出了防治葡萄根瘤蚜的新的化学药剂——过氯酸盐二乙烯。在苏联摩尔达维亚和其他一些地区试用了这种药剂，结果证明，用上少量这种新药剂（要比二氯乙烷少四分之三）就能完全消灭葡萄根瘤蚜。
    近一世纪以来，全世界种植葡萄的人同葡萄根瘤蚜——葡萄园最危险的害虫进行着顽强的斗争，但并无成效。最近二十五—三十年内，这种害虫破坏了将近六百万公顷的葡萄园！很早以前，许多国家就答应授予发明有效防治葡萄根瘤蚜药剂的人以巨额奖金。但是，到目前为止还没有一个人得到这笔奖金。
    苏联发明的新药剂有效期可达二年以上。天然瓦斯、伴生气或者石油工厂的瓦斯和氯都可以作为生产这种药剂的原料。（新华社）（附图片）
    苏联新出产一种芦苇刈割机，能够在河岸、湖中、沼泽地区收割芦苇，并能自动把收下的芦苇打成捆。当收割冰上和冻地上的芦苇时，用拖拉机牵引，每小时可收高达八米的芦苇三吨半到四吨半，在泥泞地上使用时，轮子上要加上特制的履带，收割速度由每小时两公里到十五公里。上图为新的芦苇刈割机。
