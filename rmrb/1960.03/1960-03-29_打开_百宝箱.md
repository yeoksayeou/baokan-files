　　Opening the "Treasure Chest"

　　People like to call coal "black gold," but in reality, the uses of coal are far more valuable than gold. Coal can not only be used directly as fuel, but also can be refined into tar, gasoline, and made into chemical fertilizers, dyes, plastics, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber and other products, and can also extract rare elements. Therefore, some workers sing: Coal is a "treasure chest," filled with treasures; open this "treasure chest," and the gold and silver treasures will never be used up.

　　In the spirit of "making the most of everything," we should open this "treasure chest" and make full use of its treasures. Comprehensive utilization of coal is a long-term technical policy. Vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of coal is of particularly urgent significance at present. It is an important aspect of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement sweeping the country. Breaking through the barrier of comprehensive coal utilization can improve the technical level of enterprises. With the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement and the rapid increase in the production capacity of factories and mines, the demand for raw materials, materials, and fuels has greatly increased, which requires us to further excavate the treasures in coal and make full use of coal. Shandong Province alone can save 1.8 million tons of coal this year simply by changing from direct combustion of coal to using gasified coal as fuel. Dalian-Luda (Lüda) city has utilized the "waste" that used to be lost during coal combustion and has recovered and processed more than 20 products such as diesel, gasoline, plastics, and crude benzene. These are all important fuels and raw materials. It can be seen that vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of coal is a good way to "fuel" production and the technical innovation movement.

　　How can we open this "treasure chest" of coal? Launching a mass movement, implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and carrying out comprehensive utilization are the golden keys. Dalian-Luda and other places have conscientiously done so and have achieved remarkable results. May everyone pick up this golden key.

### 打开“百宝箱”

    打开“百宝箱”
    人们都喜欢把煤叫做“乌金”，实际上煤的用途远非金子可比。煤，不仅可以直接作燃料，而且可以提炼出焦油、汽油，制成化肥、染料、塑料、合成纤维、合成橡胶等产品、并可提取稀有元素。所以，有的工人作歌说：煤炭是只“百宝箱”，奇珍异宝里面装；打开这只“百宝箱”，金银财宝用不光。
    根据“物尽其用”的精神，我们应该打开这只“百宝箱”，把其中的奇珍异宝充分利用起来。煤炭综合利用是一项长期的技术政策。当前大搞煤炭综合利用，尤其有迫切的意义。它是目前席卷全国的技术革新和技术革命运动的一个重要方面。攻破煤炭综合利用这一关，可以使企业的技术水平提高一步。技术革新运动蓬勃发展，厂矿生产能力迅速提高，需要原料、材料、燃料的数量大大增加，就更需要挖掘煤炭中的财宝，充分利用煤炭。山东省仅是把用煤直接燃烧改为用煤气作燃料，今年一年就可以节省煤炭一百八十万吨。旅大市把过去煤炭燃烧时白白跑掉的“废物”利用起来，已经回收和加工出柴油、汽油、塑料、粗苯等二十多种产品。这都是重要的燃料和原材料。可见，大搞煤炭综合利用，是给生产和技术革新运动“加油”的好办法。
    怎样来打开煤炭这只“百宝箱”呢？大搞群众运动，贯彻土洋并举的方针，开展综合利用，是把金钥匙。旅大等地认真这样作了，收到了显著的效果。愿大家都拿起这把金钥匙。
