Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, March 22nd: The Chiang Kai-shek clique staged a farce of electing a puppet "president" at the puppet "National Assembly" on March 21st. Chiang Kai-shek's reelection as the third puppet "president" brings to a temporary end the acute struggle of intrigue between the US and Chiang Kai-shek over the puppet "presidential" election issue.

The struggle between the US and Chiang Kai-shek over Chiang Kai-shek's reelection as puppet "president" was intense. In order to further control Taiwan and promote its "two Chinas" plot, US imperialism took advantage of the expiration of Chiang Kai-shek's term as puppet "president" this May, instigating pro-American elements inside and outside Taiwan to make a lot of noise, opposing the revision of the puppet "constitution" as a pretext, opposing Chiang Kai-shek's reelection as the next puppet "president," and forcing Chiang to step down. Pro-American elements, headed by Hu Shih, publicly raised the banner of overthrowing Chiang as early as the end of last year, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek "peacefully" "transfer power." During the puppet "National Assembly" meeting, some pro-American elements in the United States, Hong Kong, and other places also refused to attend the puppet "National Assembly" meeting, creating a situation of internal and external attacks on the Chiang Kai-shek clique and forcing Chiang to step down.

Chiang Kai-shek tried his best to resist and fight against the US-instigated activities to overthrow him, launching a movement to support Chiang's reelection inside and outside Taiwan, while also vigorously "suppressing" the speeches to overthrow Chiang. On February 20th, at the opening ceremony of the puppet "National Assembly," Chiang Kai-shek openly accused the United States of "arbitrarily speaking of the fallacy of dividing into two Chinas" out of "cowardly and selfish mentality." In order to create a legal basis for his reelection as puppet "president" without creating an unfavorable situation of amending the puppet "constitution," Chiang Kai-shek, through his henchmen, used the method of not amending the puppet "constitution" but only revising the puppet "constitution's" "temporary provisions." In the "temporary provisions," he added clauses such as "During the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, the president and vice president may be reelected without being restricted by Article 47 of the constitution, which limits reelection to one term," forcing the puppet "National Assembly" to pass it, reluctantly becoming the third puppet "president." On the 22nd, the puppet "Vice President" Chen Cheng was also re-elected as puppet "Vice President" in this election farce.

    美蒋之间一场尖锐斗争暂告一段落
    蒋介石连任伪“总统”
    据新华社22日讯　台北消息：3月21日，蒋介石集团在伪“国民大会”上演出了一出选举伪“总统”的滑稽剧。蒋介石连任第三届伪“总统”，这使美蒋之间围绕伪“总统”选举问题的一场勾心斗角的尖锐斗争暂时告一段落。
    在蒋介石连任伪“总统”问题上，美蒋之间的斗争曾经进行得很激烈，美帝国主义为了进一步控制台湾，推行其“两个中国”的阴谋，利用蒋介石在今年5月伪“总统”任期届满的时机，策动台湾内外的亲美分子鼓噪齐鸣，以反对修改伪“宪法”为名，反对蒋介石连任下届伪“总统”，逼蒋下台。以胡适为首的亲美分子早在去年年底就公开打出倒蒋旗号，要蒋介石“和平”地“转移政权”。伪“国大”开会期间，在美国、香港等地的一些亲美分子，还拒绝出席伪“国大”会议，造成对蒋介石集团内外夹击、逼蒋下台的形势。
    蒋介石极力抵制和反抗美国策动的倒蒋活动，一面在台湾内外发动拥蒋连任运动，同时竭力“围剿”倒蒋言论。2月20日，蒋介石在伪“国大”开幕式上，公开指责美国“恣言分成两个中国的谬论”出于“卑怯自私心理”。蒋介石为了制造连任伪“总统”的法律根据，又不致造成修改伪“宪法”的不利处境，通过他的党羽，用不修改伪“宪法”而只修订伪“宪法”“临时条款”的办法，在“临时条款”中，增加“动员戡乱时期，总统、副总统得连选连任，不受宪法第四十七条连任一次的限制”等条款，迫使伪“国民大会”通过，勉强当上了第三届伪“总统”。22日，伪“副总统”陈诚，也在这场选举滑稽剧中再次被选为伪“副总统”。
