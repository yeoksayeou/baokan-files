    Displaying the Power of Women
    Li Yingli, Fusuijing Street Office, Beijing

    The film "Always Spring in Full Bloom" vividly reflects the new outlook of street women actively taking up production posts during the Great Leap Forward, illustrating that it is impossible for women to achieve complete liberation if they spend all day turning around the stove and serving their husbands and children; they must participate in labor production. However, their participation in production labor is not so easy and requires going through major and minor struggles. The film, through the images of several women such as Cai Feng and Gui Zhen, depicts the perseverance and determination of housewives who actively demand to break away from trivial housework and participate in socialist construction, as well as their soaring enthusiasm.

    The film also reflects the thoughts of various types of people in life: advanced, intermediate, and backward. For example, Director Dai, the head of the residents' committee, organizes street women to participate in production and work tirelessly and without complaint, setting up canteens, nurseries, sewing cooperatives, and spare-time schools so that women are not burdened by housework and can concentrate on production and study. Her work follows the mass line, always inspiring everyone's self-awareness, so her work achieves good results. For example, Cai Feng's mother went to blame her for leading her daughter-in-law to not want to come home, ruining things. However, she didn't get anxious at all, and patiently used the comparison of the fate of women in the old and new societies to make this short-sighted old lady, satisfied with the status quo, finally understand the great social significance of women participating in production. Later, she not only supported her daughter-in-law in participating in production, but also became an active member of street work. Director Dai's words and deeds fully embody the noble qualities of a Communist Party member who works diligently and conscientiously for the people, and is a role model for our street workers to learn from. Cai Feng represents the vast majority of housewives on the streets. Inspired by the education of the Party and the Great Leap Forward, their awareness has been raised, they actively participate in production, and family relations have become more harmonious. Gui Zhen's lover is infuriating to watch. There are still people like this in today's society. They look down on women and are afraid that their lovers will participate in production, and that no one will serve them, representing the individualistic thoughts of bourgeois intellectuals who covet enjoyment. Gui Zhen's struggle against him, and his initial transformation, proves that women can only improve family relations and truly respect and love each other as husband and wife by actively participating in labor production. The fact that Lu Afeng hid her sewing machine and then automatically took it out also shows that the process of women stepping out of the small circle of the family and running to the production post is also a process of overcoming their own shortcomings and carrying out self-transformation.

    This film allows people to see the power of our women starting from scratch during the Great Leap Forward to create wealth for the country. This is indeed the case. After our Fusuijing organized women to participate in production, everything changed greatly: consumer streets became production streets; women who were originally illiterate, three of them have already learned to manage factories with two or three hundred people, and many have participated in "Hero Meetings." This is the great power of organized women. No wonder the cadre of the reform school in the film shouted "Long live women!"

    显示了妇女的力量
    北京市福绥境街道办事处　李应立
    影片“万紫千红总是春”鲜明地反映了大跃进中，街道妇女积极走上生产岗位的新面貌，说明了妇女整天围着锅台转、伺候丈夫和孩子，要想得到彻底解放是不可能的，必须参加劳动生产。但是，他们参加生产劳动并不是那么容易的，需要经过大大小小的斗争。影片通过彩凤、桂贞等几个妇女形象，描写了家庭妇女积极要求摆脱家务琐事，参加社会主义建设的毅力、决心和她们的冲天干劲。
    影片也反映了生活中先进、中间和落后各类人物的思想。比如居民委员会的主任戴妈妈，她不辞辛苦，任劳任怨地组织街道妇女参加生产和工作，筹办食堂、托儿所、缝纫社、业余学校，使妇女们不受家务拖累，安心生产和学习，她工作走群众路线，总是启发大家的自觉，所以工作收到很好的效果。比如彩凤妈去责怪她把自己的媳妇带得老不想回家，把事情办坏了。她却一点不发急，耐心地用新旧社会妇女命运的对比，使这位眼光短浅、满足现状的老太太，终于明白了妇女参加生产的伟大社会意义，以后她不但赞助媳妇参加生产，自己也成了街道工作的积极分子。戴妈妈的言行，充分体现了一个共产党员勤勤恳恳为人民服务的高尚品质，是我们街道工作者学习的榜样。彩凤代表了街道上绝大多数家庭妇女，她们受到党的教育和大跃进的鼓舞，觉悟提高了，积极参加生产，家庭关系也更融洽了。桂贞的爱人，看了直叫人生气，这样的人在今天社会里还有，他们瞧不起妇女，也唯恐爱人参加生产，自己没人伺候，代表了资产阶级知识分子的贪图享受的个人主义思想。桂贞对他进行的斗争，以及他的开始转变，证明了妇女只有积极参加劳动生产，才能改善家庭关系，夫妇真正互相尊敬友爱。从陆阿凤藏起自己的缝纫机到自动拿出缝纫机的事，也说明妇女走出家庭小圈子，奔到生产岗位上的过程，也是克服本身存在的缺点，进行自我改造的过程。
    这部片子能够叫人看到我们妇女在大跃进中白手起家，为国家创造财富的力量。事实也正是如此。像我们福绥境组织妇女参加生产以后，各方面就大变了样：消费街道变成了生产街道；原来一字不识的妇女，有三个已经会管理有二三百人的工厂，参加“群英会”的就不少，这就是组织起来的妇女的巨大力量，怪不得影片中那位教养院的干部要高呼“妇女万岁”！
