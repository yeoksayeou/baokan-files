　　Ensuring strong early rice seedlings is the primary step in striving for a bumper early rice harvest; increasing temperature and preventing cold are important measures to guarantee the cultivation of strong early rice seedlings and prevent seedling rot. In the season for sowing early rice, the ground temperature is low, which can easily lead to seedling rot. In the past, early rice seedlings in the Yangtze and Huai River basins often suffered significant losses due to this. This is an old problem, and old problems must be solved with new methods. Failure to attach importance to solving it will seriously affect the early rice harvest. It is very important that the leaders of Changde in Hunan and Yancheng in Jiangsu, and other counties, promptly grasp this key issue and mobilize the masses to adopt temperature-increasing and cold-preventing measures, such as preparing covering materials for the seedling fields, massively relocating seedling fields, adding water storage fields, building windbreaks, and spreading warming fertilizers.

　　The key to solving temperature increase and cold prevention lies in the leadership's attention, early action, and early brainstorming of solutions. Like Changde and Yancheng, revolutionary temperature increase and cold prevention measures should be taken before sowing to ensure timely sowing, the growth of strong seedlings, and no seedling rot.

    做到不烂秧
    培育早稻壮秧，是力争早稻大丰收的首要环节；增温防寒，又是保证培育早稻壮秧、防止烂秧的重要措施。早稻落谷的季节，地温较低，容易发生烂秧，过去在长江和淮河流域的早稻秧苗，常常因此造成很大损失。这是个老问题，老问题就要用新办法去解决。不重视解决，就会严重影响到早稻的丰收。湖南常德和江苏盐城等县领导上，及时抓住这个关键性的问题，发动群众采取为秧田准备覆盖物、秧田大搬家、增设蓄水田、建造挡风圩、铺施暖性肥料等增温防寒的办法，是十分重要的。
    解决增温防寒的关键在于领导重视，早动手，早想办法，应当像常德和盐城那样，在落谷以前就采取革命性的增温防寒措施，做到适时落谷，长壮秧，不烂秧。
