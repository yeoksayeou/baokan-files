Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 29th: From cities to villages, Heilongjiang Province is mobilizing everyone to plant small oil crops such as sunflowers, with planting time advanced more than twenty days compared to previous years. Tangyuan County, which is making the fastest progress, has completed 91% of its planned planting area. By March 24th, Zhaozhou County had planted 57,000 mu of sunflowers. Cadres of the CCP Acheng County Committee and the County People's Committee have also planted many castor beans and sunflowers in the courtyards of their offices.

In order to support national industrial construction, this year Heilongjiang Province has expanded the planting area of small oil crops to 2.7 million mu, an increase of one-third compared to 1959. Due to the adoption of a combination of large-scale operations and scattered planting, a province-wide upsurge of everyone planting small oil crops has been formed. Counties such as Kedong and Baiquan have adopted intercropping methods, and some forest areas have mixed small oil crops in young forest land. In Acheng County, a total of more than 97,000 mu of land suitable for planting small oil crops has been found in vacant areas such as in front of and behind houses, along field edges, roadsides, riverbanks, ditches, wasteland, and barren hillsides, accounting for more than 10% of the county's planned planting area this year.

During the planting of small oil crops, various regions enthusiastically responded to the call of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, requiring each person in the towns to plant 50 plants and each person in the countryside to plant 100 oil crops. Acheng County has launched a high tide of planting oil crops, and more than 97,000 young people in Wangkui County have also planted more than 16 million oil crops in ten days. The Communist Youth League organizations in various regions have also launched competitions among young people to plant oil crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 29th: Shandong Province is conscientiously implementing the principle of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round great leap forward, and is steadily carrying out peanut planting preparations to ensure a bumper harvest of oil crops this year.

This year, Shandong's planned peanut planting area is larger than last year. In most areas, peanut planting plans have been implemented down to the team and field level. In order to strive for a continued leap in peanut production this year, various regions summarized and promoted the experience of great harvests in the past two years as early as last winter. At the same time, Party committees at all levels have taken effective measures to strengthen leadership over peanut production. In concentrated peanut production areas, the First Secretary is in charge, peanut production bases are established at each level, experimental fields and command fields are established, and large-area high-yield fields are generally established. Three counties, Penglai, Junan, and Muping, have established 470,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields, with fertilization reaching more than 10,000 jin per mu. In order to combat drought and conserve moisture, and ensure timely sowing with full seedling emergence, spring peanut fields in Yantai and Linyi prefectures have been generally harrowed and leveled on the basis of deep plowing and deep turning. Penglai County has also compacted soil and sand on more than 80,000 mu of thin mountain land, transforming barren land into fertile land, and has also adopted crop rotation methods with sweet potatoes to improve heavily cropped land, striving for increased peanut production.

This year, there have also been major reforms in peanut planting technology in various regions. Various regions are learning and promoting Penglai County's advanced planting methods of warm water soaking to promote germination and using the Huilong fire kang to cultivate sand to promote germination. These two methods can save about 15% of seeds and ensure fast seedling emergence, uniform emergence, and strong seedlings. At present, various regions are actively organizing technology transfer. According to statistics from ten counties including Penglai, Haiyang, Junan, Wulian, and Guanxian, nearly 20,000 technicians have been trained, and a large number of professional teams have been established in various regions. Junan County has modified more than 2,000 peanut planters and trained more than 3,000 planting technicians.

Currently, people's communes in peanut production areas are busily conducting seed selection and germination tests.

This newspaper reports: Zhongxian County, Sichuan Province, a nationally renowned high-yield rapeseed county, is overcoming complacency, relaxation, and the idea of a fixed harvest, and is wholeheartedly and single-mindedly grasping late-stage management of rapeseed, vigorously applying flowering fertilizer to rapeseed buds and flower spikes.

Due to careful early-stage management, the seedlings of Zhongxian County's 40,000 mu of rapeseed are generally growing well this year. According to inspection and ranking: Type 1 seedlings, with a plant height of five to six feet and the first and second branches reaching fifty to sixty, account for 48.1%; Type 2 seedlings, with a plant height of four to five feet and large and small branches ranging from thirty to fifty, account for 41%; Type 3 seedlings account for only 10.9%. The largest "Rapeseed King" is more than six feet tall with more than 450 large and small branches. As a result, some cadres and masses developed complacency, relaxation, and the idea of a fixed harvest, and once relaxed field management.

In response to these ideological situations, many communes held mobilization rallies, spoke extensively about the favorable situation and the great significance of strengthening late-stage management of rapeseed, and launched a blitz campaign. By early March, more than 32,000 mu of rapeseed in the county had been fertilized once during the flowering period. All 40,000 mu of rapeseed in the county were universally treated for pests six or seven times.

In order to strengthen leadership in late-stage field management of rapeseed, county party secretaries have all gone deep into the fields to specifically help the masses summarize experience; a 10,000-person inspection team was organized throughout the county to conduct inspections in various regions, promptly commend advanced examples, and promote advanced experiences. Mutual inspections and evaluations were also widely carried out between districts and districts, communes and communes, and teams and teams, which effectively promoted and advanced the late-stage management work.

    黑龙江人人种植油料作物
    山东扩大花生播种面积，大部地区种植计划落实到田
    四川忠县再鼓干劲大追花期肥加强油菜后期管理
    据新华社哈尔滨29日电　黑龙江省从城市到农村，全民动手大种向日葵等小油料作物，播种时间较历年提早二十多天。进度最快的汤原县已完成计划播种面积的91％，肇州县到3月24日已播种向日葵五万七千亩。中共阿城县委和县人民委员会的干部，也在机关院内种了许多蓖麻和向日葵。
    为了支援国家工业建设，今年黑龙江省种植小油料作物面积扩大到二百七十万亩，比1959年增长三分之一。各地由于采取了大面积经营和零星种植相结合的措施，全省形成全民动手种植小油料作物的高潮，克东、拜泉等县采取套种的办法，有些林区在幼林地混种小油料作物。阿城县各地，已在房前、房后、地边、路边、河边、沟边、荒地、荒山岗等空隙地，挖出可以种植小油料作物的土地九万七千多亩，占全县今年计划播种面积的10％多。
    各地在播种小油料作物当中，热烈地响应了中共黑龙江省委、省人民委员会，要求城镇每人种五十株、农村每人种一百株油料作物的口号。阿城县已掀起了种植油料作物高潮，望奎县的九万七千多名青少年，也在十天时间内，种了一千六百多万棵油料作物。各地的共青团组织，还在青年中开展了种植油料作物的竞赛运动。
    据新华社济南29日电　山东各地认真贯彻以粮为纲全面跃进的方针，踏踏实实地进行花生播种准备，保证今年油料作物大丰收。
    今年山东花生播种面积，计划比去年扩大。大部地区花生种植计划已经落实到队到田。为了力争今年花生产量继续跃进，各地早在去冬就总结了过去两年大丰收的经验，加以推广。同时各级党委都采取有效措施对花生生产加强领导。在花生集中产区都由第一书记挂帅，层层确定花生生产基地，建立试验田和指挥田，并普遍建立了大面积丰产方。蓬莱、莒南、牟平等三个县已建立起四十七万亩大面积高额丰产田，每亩施肥达一万斤以上。为了抗旱保墒，保证适时播种一次全苗，烟台、临沂两个专区的春花生田在深耕深翻的基础上普遍耙实耢平。蓬莱县并对八万多亩山岭薄地进行了压土压沙，改薄地为良田，还采取与地瓜轮作换茬的方法改治重茬地，争取花生多增产。
    今年各地对花生播种技术也有很大改革。各地正在学习和推广蓬莱县的温水浸种催芽和回龙火炕培沙催芽的先进种植方法。这两个办法既可节省15％左右的种子，又可以保证出苗快、出苗齐、苗子壮。目前各地正在积极组织传授技术，据蓬莱、海阳、莒南、五莲、冠县等十个县的统计，已训练出技术员近两万名，各地并建立了大批专业队伍。莒南县已经改制两千多件花生播种器，训练出播种技术员三千多名。
    现在花生产区各人民公社正在紧张地进行选种和做发芽试验。
    本报讯　全国著名油菜高产县——四川省忠县各人民公社，破自满松劲情绪和丰收定局思想，一条心、一股劲、一个样狠抓油菜后期管理，猛施油菜苔蕾花期肥。
    忠县今年四万亩油菜由于前期管理精细，苗稼生长普遍良好。根据检查排队：一类苗株高五至六尺，仅第一第二分枝即达五六十个的占48．1％；二类苗株高四至五尺，大小分枝三十至五十个占41％；三类苗仅占10．9％，最大的“油菜王”株高六尺以上，大小分枝四百五十多个。部分干部和群众因而产生了自满松劲情绪和丰收定局思想，一度放松了田间管理。
    针对这些思想情况，许多公社都举行誓师大会，大讲有利形势和加强油菜后期管理的重大意义，开展了突击运动。到3月上旬，全县三万二千多亩油菜施了一次花期肥。全县四万亩油菜普遍治虫六、七次。
    为加强油菜后期田间管理的领导，县委书记都分别深入到田间具体帮助群众总结经验；全县组织了万人检查团到各地检查，及时表扬先进，推广先进经验。区与区、社与社、队与队还普遍开展相互检查评比，有力地促进和推动了后期管理工作。（附图片）
