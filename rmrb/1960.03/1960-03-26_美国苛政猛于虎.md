    American Oppression is Fiercer Than a Tiger
    Editor's Note: The March issue of "Reader's Digest" magazine in the United States published an article revealing the U.S. government's plunder of the people through taxation. Excerpts are translated as follows:
    A farmer wrote to me: "Who is plundering my wealth, making me so poor that I can't hold my head up?"
    He said: "I only sell each bushel of wheat for $1.73. But after it is made into 66 large loaves of bread, housewives have to pay $13.20 to buy these loaves.
    "In other words, from each loaf of bread, the farmer only gets back two and a half cents for the flour, but you have to pay twenty cents to buy the bread. Please tell me: who pocketed the profit of nine times the price of the flour?"
    I wanted to find out where that extra $0.175 went.
    The grocer told me that they only make three cents on each loaf of bread.
    Then I asked a truck driver who delivers goods to wholesalers (bakeries). He earns an average of one dollar for delivering two thousand loaves of bread, obviously just a poor, self-reliant laborer.
    I continued to investigate—tracing it all the way to the flour mills, the bakeries that bake bread, and various intermediaries, the railway bureau that transports flour, or the warehouses that store flour, etc., and then investigated the source of sugar in the bread. After asking around, I couldn't find any clues, so I had to go back and ask the farmer again.
    This time, I finally caught the blood-stained robber.
    When the flour mill grinds it into flour, excluding the factory's processing costs, there are seven federal taxes out of thin air, plus eight kinds of harsh miscellaneous taxes from the state—that is to say, when wheat becomes flour and leaves the factory, it has already been added with fifteen tax items!
    The railway authorities transporting flour only earn a tiny fraction of a cent of freight per loaf of bread—but they add five federal taxes, and every time the train passes through a state, they have to add various independent and strange tax items of that state.
    Sugar refineries have to pay eight federal taxes. ——In Louisiana, six more state taxes are added. In addition, the railway bureau that transports sugar bags will naturally add various federal taxes and state transit taxes.
    What about salt? When salt bags are stored in Chicago warehouses, they naturally have to pay various taxes. Factories for yeast, milk powder, oils, etc., are also no exception and have to pay various taxes.
    When I traced it back to the grocery store, I found that a total of 151 various harsh taxes had been added to each loaf of bread!
    Small citizens who live on salaries actually bear the heavy burden of all these taxes—these many hidden "intangible taxes" are much more cruel than direct taxes such as income tax in terms of eating people without spitting out bones!
    Every time the U.S. government spends one billion U.S. dollars, it makes every American family pay an extra twenty U.S. dollars in taxes.
    As an ordinary American, I can clearly understand this: Waste less of our money on expanding nuclear armaments, less on fighting the Cold War and "foreign aid"!
    Please have mercy: This is the money for our family's livelihood bread!

### 美国苛政猛于虎

    美国苛政猛于虎
    编者按　美国“读者文摘”杂志三月号发表一篇文章，透露了美国政府通过捐税对人民进行掠夺的情况，现摘译如下：
    一位农民写信问我：“是谁在掠夺我的财富，使我一直穷得抬不起头来？”
    他说：“每一蒲式耳（英美容量单位，约合三十六公升）麦子我只卖了一元七角三分美金。但拿它做成六十六条大面包之后，主妇们却要付出十三元二角美金，才能买到这些面包。
    “换句话说，从每个面包中，农民只得回二分半美金的面粉代价，但你却要付出两角钱才能买到面包。请问：这多出来的九倍面粉价格的利润进了谁的荷包？”
    我想找出那多余的一角七分五美金到哪去了？
    杂货店老板告诉我，他们每条面包只能赚三分钱。
    然后我又去问一位货车司机，他是给批发商（面包店）开车送货的。他平均要送二千条面包才能赚到一元美金，显然只是一个可怜的自食其力的劳动者。
    我继续往下追究——一直追查到了磨面粉的厂坊、烘制面包的面包店和各种中间商，运输面粉的铁路局或堆存面粉的仓库等等中间经手人，然后又去调查面包中的糖的来源。这样问来问去，寻不出端倪，我只好回头再去询问那位农民。
    这次，我终于捉住了那个血手淋淋的强盗。
    当面粉厂将它磨成面粉时，除去厂方的加工成本，凭空来了七种联邦税项，外加本州的八种苛捐杂税——就是说，当小麦变成面粉出厂时，已经加上了十五道捐税名目！
    运输面粉的铁路当局，在每条面包的原料中只赚去一分美元的几分之一的微小运费——但是，却又加上了五种联邦税项，此外，每当火车经过一州时，还得加上该州的各种独立而奇异的捐税名目。
    炼糖厂要付出八种联邦税。——在路易斯安那州更要外加六种本州捐税。此外，运输糖包的铁路局，自然更会给它加上各种联邦税和各州的过境捐税。
    盐呢？当盐包堆存在芝加哥仓库中时，自然也要付各种捐税。酵粉、奶粉、油类等等的工厂，同样无例外地也得付出各种捐税的。
    当我再追循到杂货店中时，发现在每一条面包上，已经先后共加上了一百五十一道各种名目的苛捐杂税！
    靠薪水收入为生的小市民们，实际上负担了所有这许多捐税的重压——这许多隐藏不见的“无形捐税”，吃人不见血的程度，比所得税等等直接税要更残毒得多！
    每逢美国政府花掉十亿美金的时候，它就使每个美国家庭多付出二十元美金的税款。
    作为一个普通美国人民，我是能够清楚明白这点的：少浪费我们的钱去扩充核子军备、少去打冷战和“援外”吧！
    积积功德：这是我们养家活口的面包钱！
