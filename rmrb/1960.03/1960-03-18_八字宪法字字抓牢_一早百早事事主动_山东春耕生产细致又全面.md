Xinhua News Agency, Jinan. Shandong province's people, using the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" as the guiding principle, large-scale high-yield fields as the base, and "thousand, hundred, ten-thousand" high-yield demonstration plots as models, are launching a vigorous large-scale high-yield competition to strive for continued leaps forward in this year's agricultural production.

This year, Shandong Province's preparatory work for spring farming and the spring farming activities themselves have been meticulous, comprehensive, fast, and good. The vast majority of the province's wheat has been top-dressed with fertilizer for returning to green and watered; tens of millions of mu of spring land have also been fertilized as base fertilizer and deeply plowed and irrigated; spring plowing and harrowing has reached 44.7 million mu; and more than 27 million pieces of various agricultural implements have been created and improved, creating favorable conditions for intensive cultivation. The 50 million mu of high-yield fields that various localities are preparing as large-scale high-yield bases are even more deeply plowed, finely harrowed, heavily fertilized, and well-managed. Every word of the "Eight-Character Constitution" is implemented and takes root, and the vast majority can meet the requirements of guaranteeing harvests despite drought or flood.

After various localities began preparatory work for spring farming this year, they deeply studied the principles of specifically implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" in different regions, under different conditions, and for different crops, systematically summarized the experiences of last year's large-scale stable high yields and the leap from low yields to high yields, and, combined with this year's new situation and increased production requirements, formulated technical operating procedures for intensive cultivation, seizing the key points of each item of the "Eight-Character Constitution" according to the time and local conditions. "Soil" emphasizes grasping the word "plowing," doing a good job in spring plowing to preserve moisture, and ensuring timely sowing and full and strong seedlings; "Fertilizer" emphasizes grasping the word "effectiveness," not only ensuring quantity but also ensuring quality, maintaining fertilizer effectiveness, applying fertilizer in a timely manner, and paying attention to bringing fertilizer effectiveness into play; "Water" emphasizes grasping the word "irrigation," ensuring timely and appropriate spring irrigation; "Seed" emphasizes grasping the word "good," extensively promoting and cultivating improved varieties; "Density" emphasizes grasping the word "appropriate," ensuring appropriate and rational close planting; "Protection" emphasizes grasping the word "prevention," focusing on prevention and striking first; "Management" emphasizes grasping the word "meticulous," achieving farming like gardening and management like embroidery; "Tools" emphasizes grasping the word "improvement," improving and increasing, and carrying out comprehensive support.

Among the eight characters "Soil, Fertilizer, Water, Seed, Density, Protection, Management, and Tools," "Water and Fertilizer" are taken as the center, "early" is taken as the lead, and overall development is achieved with a prominent center. For example, in the spring irrigation campaign, various localities made preparations for water sources and water tools before the Spring Festival, so when the spring drought just appeared, Party committees at all levels immediately mobilized large numbers of people and quickly watered more than 40 million mu of wheat for returning to green and irrigated more than 5 million mu of spring white land, advancing the irrigation time by half a month to twenty days compared with previous years. Some mountainous, hilly, or remote highlands that used to be water conservancy dead ends also received water, quickly eliminating the spring drought in its initial stages. While vigorously grasping water conservancy, various localities also made preparations for fertilizer application early according to different situations and according to the time and local conditions, striving for fertilizers to bring about greater benefits. After the Gaotang cotton area changed from late fertilization to early fertilization, the fertilizer had sufficient fermentation time, which improved fertilizer efficiency; at the same time, changing from shallow application to deep application and from one-time application to phased and layered application enabled the cotton roots to develop well, set bolls early, set more bolls, and set large bolls. Wheat-growing areas generally adopted the method of top-dressing according to seedling growth, making better use of fertilizer and bringing fertilizer benefits into play. Changyi County, according to the growth of wheat seedlings, top-dressed more than 40,000 mu of high-yield wheat with 200 jin of dry ash and phosphate and potash fertilizer per mu, effectively promoting the growth of these wheat seedlings.

In order to strike first and do a good job in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, this year's plant protection work in various localities has been done earlier and more meticulously. At present, various people's communes have created, modified, and imitated more than 20 kinds of native pesticides and equipment, treated 8.2 million mu of wheat rust, and treated 23 billion jin of insect-infested stalks and stubble; more than 90% of the sweet potato seeds that have been placed on heated brick beds and 2.6 million mu of spring-sown crop seeds have been soaked in warm water or treated with pesticides. Such a large-scale crop prevention and control work has never been seen in Shandong Province's history.

In order to further implement the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" and achieve victory in the "Thousand, Hundred, Ten-Thousand" high-yield campaign, various localities have also taken high-yield demonstration plots as models and red and expert activists as the backbone to widely and deeply launch mass scientific research activities to ensure that large-scale high-yield goals are established on a reliable basis. In this campaign, various localities have adopted the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, and farmers, combining production, learning, and scientific research, and combining old experts, new experts, and local experts, cultivating millions of new-type farmers who are "red in heart and skillful in hand." They compete to be advanced, offer clever plans, set great ambitions, and strive to be upstream, becoming models for carrying out the "Thousand, Hundred, Ten-Thousand" high-yield competition. The Yexian Xiyou People's Commune, led by national model worker Xu Jianchun, conducted dozens of experiments on each word of the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" in scientific research activities, with more than 250 experimental items, and combined research and production, effectively and powerfully driving production.

    八字宪法字字抓牢　一早百早事事主动
    山东春耕生产细致又全面
    新华社济南电　山东各地人民以农业“八字宪法”为纲、大面积丰产方为基地、“千、百、万”高额丰产田为标兵，展开轰轰烈烈的大面积丰产竞赛运动，决心争取今年农业生产继续跃进。
    今年，山东省的备耕、春耕活动进行得细致、全面，又快、又好。全省的小麦，绝大多数追了返青肥，浇了返青水；数千万亩春地也施上底肥，进行了深耕、春灌；春耕、春耙已达四千四百七十万亩；创造和改良各种农具二千七百多万件，为精耕细作创造了有利条件。各地准备作大面积丰产基地的五千万亩丰产田，更是耕的深、耙的细、施肥多、管的好，“八字宪法”字字落实生根，绝大多数都可以达到旱、涝保收的要求。
    各地今年开始备耕工作后，就深入地研究了不同地区、不同条件、不同作物具体执行“八字宪法”的原则，系统地总结了去年大面积稳定高产和由低产跃为高产的经验，并且结合今年的新情况和增产要求，制订了精耕细作的技术操作规程，因时因地制宜地抓住了“八字宪法”每一项的关键。“土”是突出抓“耕”字，搞好春耕保墒，保证适时播种和苗全苗旺；“肥”是突出抓
  “效”字，不仅要保证数量而且要保证质量，保持肥效，适时施肥，注意发挥肥效；“水”是突出抓“灌”字，保证适时适量春灌；“种”是突出抓“良”字，大量推广和培育良种；“密”是突出抓“适”字，要保证适当合理密植；“保”是突出抓“防”字，以防为主，先下手为强；“管”是突出抓“细”字，做到种地如种园，管理如绣花；“工”是突出抓“改”字，又改又增，大搞配套成龙。
    在“土肥水种密保管工”八字中，又以“水、肥”为中心，抓了“早”字当头，全面发展，中心突出。例如，春灌运动，各地在春节前就作好了水源、水具等准备工作，所以当春旱刚露头，各级党委立即调动大批人马，很快浇小麦返青水四千多万亩，灌春白地五百多万亩，灌溉时间比往年提早了半个月到二十天。有些过去一向是水利死角的山区、丘陵或边远高地也浇了水，把春旱迅速消灭在初期。在大抓水利的同时，各地还根据不同情况，因时、因地制宜地及早做好施肥工作，力争肥料发挥更大的效益。高唐棉区改晚施肥为早施肥后，使肥料有充分的发酵时间，提高了肥料效能；同时，改浅施为深施，改一次施为分期分层施，使棉花根部发育良好，早结铃，多结铃，结大铃。麦田区一般采取看苗追肥的方法，更好地利用肥料和发挥肥料效益。昌邑县根据麦苗生长情况，给四万多亩丰产麦每亩追上干灰和磷钾肥二百斤，有力地促进了这些麦苗的生长。
    为了先下手为强，做好防治病虫害工作，各地今年的植物保护工作都作得更早更细。目前，各人民公社已创制、改制、仿制各种土药械二十多种，防治小麦锈病八百二十万亩，处理有虫秸秆、根茬等二百三十亿斤；已上炕的甘薯种子和二百六十多万亩春播作物种子，有90％以上进行了温水浸种或农药拌种。这样大规模的农作物防治工作，是山东省历史上从来没有过的。
    为进一步贯彻农业“八字宪法”，使“千、百、万”丰产运动取得胜利，各地还以丰产方为标兵，以红专积极分子为骨干，广泛深入地展开了群众性科学研究活动，以确保大面积丰产目标建立在可靠基础上，在这个运动中，各地采取了领导干部、技术员、农民三结合，生产、学习、科学研究三结合，老专家、新专家和土专家三结合的办法，培养了数百万“心红手巧”的新型农民，他们赛先进、献巧计、立大志、争上游，成为开展“千百万”丰产竞赛的标兵。全国著名劳模徐建春领导的掖县西由人民公社在科学研究活动中，将农业“八字宪法”的每一个字都做了几十项试验，试验的项目达二百五十多个，并且做到研究和生产相结合，及时有力地带动了生产。
