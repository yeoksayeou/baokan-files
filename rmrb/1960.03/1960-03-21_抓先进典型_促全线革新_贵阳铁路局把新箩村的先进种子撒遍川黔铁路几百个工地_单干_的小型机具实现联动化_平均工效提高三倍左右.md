(From our correspondent in Guiyang, March 20th) More than 30,000 employees fighting on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line are promoting the experience of the Xinluo Village construction site. On the basis of comprehensively promoting small machine construction, they are vigorously engaging in linked operations. The average work efficiency has increased by about three times compared to the same period last year, bringing the rapid construction of this railway into a new stage.

The specific approach to linked operation is to improve the large number of manufactured "independent" small machines, add necessary equipment, and organically combine them. Using methods such as upward and downward movement, and using weight to carry light loads, the processes of excavation, loading, transportation, unloading, filling, and compaction are formed into a linked operation line, thereby improving work efficiency and saving labor.

Currently, on the 306-kilometer-long construction line of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, magnificent scenes of linked rapid construction can be seen everywhere. On many earthwork sites, slide tracks crisscross, as dense as spiderwebs. "Slide boats" fully loaded with earth and rocks, two or three linked together, shuttle back and forth. "Flip-board cars" and "circulating trains" rush up and down, accurately pouring earth and rocks at predetermined locations. Horizontal tampers and elephant-trunk tampers operated by one person quickly flatten and compact the roadbed. On the construction site, apart from a few workers wearing symbols such as "conductor" and "dispatcher" to direct the construction of indigenous and foreign machines, there are very few production personnel. Now, although the number of workers on the entire line has been reduced by more than half compared to the past, the amount of work completed each day is about the same as before.

The linked operation of small machines started from the Xinluo Village construction site on this line. The Xinluo Village construction site is more than 1,300 meters long, with mountain ravines as deep as more than 20 meters at both ends. According to construction requirements, most of the mountain needs to be cut away, and the deep ravines at both ends need to be filled. The amount of earth and rocks to be excavated and filled is more than 600,000 cubic meters, making it one of the key earthwork projects on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line. The project was originally undertaken by more than 4,000 people. After the rural areas launched a large-scale production movement in April last year, the railway department, under the slogan of vigorously supporting agricultural production, sent a large number of road construction workers back to the countryside. The Xinluo Village construction site successively repatriated five batches of migrant workers, accounting for 90% of the total number of workers on the site. In this situation, if construction were still carried out according to the old methods, it would take at least 26 months to complete the remaining half of the work on this construction site, not until April 1961, which would greatly exceed the planned completion time. Based on this new situation, the construction site Party committee decided to vigorously engage in technical innovation and seek labor from tools. The construction site successively created 31 types of small machines, totaling more than 300 pieces, completely eliminating manual digging, carrying, and lifting. The average work efficiency per person per day increased from 0.5 cubic meters in the past to about 5 cubic meters. In order to further exert the role of these small machines, the construction site Party committee, in the spirit of continuous revolution, conducted research with engineering technicians and workers, appropriately improved these "independent" small machines, and formed assembly lines, quickly realizing linked operation and automation, and the work efficiency was greatly improved. Since August last year, the average daily output per person on this construction site has been more than 6 cubic meters, and in January this year, it jumped to 30 cubic meters. Some groups even broke through the 100 cubic meter mark, becoming a red banner for rapid construction on the Sichuan-Guizhou line. By February 21, this work site had been successfully completed. Preliminary calculations show that it was completed 13 months ahead of the original plan, saving more than 870,000 workdays, and the quality fully met the specifications. The project cost was reduced by about 64% compared to the original plan.

The experience of the Xinluo Village construction site has attracted the attention of the Guiyang Railway Bureau. In addition to holding on-site meetings to carefully summarize this experience, they also specially sent bureau Party committee members, deputy directors, and chief engineers to form working groups to go deep into the earthwork construction sites along the line to promote it, and helped some construction sites formulate detailed plans for linked construction. Through on-site meetings and the help of working groups, many construction sites have launched an innovative upsurge of vigorously engaging in linked construction. Currently, more than 170 earthwork construction sites on the entire line have realized linked operation, and more than 200 construction sites are also approaching the level of linked operation. According to the construction plan of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, it was originally planned to increase 30,000 people from the fourth quarter of last year. Now, due to vigorously engaging in linked operation, the plan can be completed on schedule without increasing labor. (Attached Picture)

    抓先进典型　促全线革新
    贵阳铁路局把新箩村的先进种子撒遍川黔铁路几百个工地
    “单干”的小型机具实现联动化　平均工效提高三倍左右
    本报贵阳20日电　奋战在川黔铁路线上的三万多名职工，推广新箩村工地的经验，在全面推行小型机具施工的基础上，大搞联动化施工，平均工效比去年同期增加三倍左右，使这条铁路的快速施工跨入一个新阶段。
    联动化施工的具体作法是：把已制造出的大批“单干”的小型机具加以改进，补置必要的设备，使之有机地组合起来，利用上往下滑、以重带轻等方式，使挖、装、运、卸、填、夯等工序，形成一个联动作业线，从而提高工效，节约劳动力。
    目前，在长达三百零六公里的川黔铁路施工线上，到处都可看到联动化快速施工的壮丽场面。许多土石方工地上滑板道纵横交错，密如蛛网，满载土石方的“滑船”，两三个连成一串，穿梭其间；“翻板车”、“循环列车”上下奔驰，把土石方准确地倾泻在预定地点；一人操作的横杆夯、象鼻夯等，迅速地把路基夯平打实。在工地上，除了少数佩戴“列车员”、“调度员”等符号的工人指挥土洋机具施工外，生产人员寥寥无几。现在，全线工人虽然比过去减少一半以上，每天完成的工作量却同过去差不多。
    小型机具联动化施工，是从这条线路上的新箩村工地开始的。新箩村工地全长一千三百多米，两端是深达二十多米的山沟。按照施工要求，需要把大山削掉大半，填平两端的深沟，挖填的土石方有六十多万立方米，是川黔铁路线上的重点土石方工程之一。担负修建这一工程的原来有四千多人。去年4月，农村掀起大生产运动后，铁路部门在大力支援农业生产的口号下，把大批筑路民工送回了农村。新箩村工地先后遣返了五批民工，占工地总人数的90％。在这种情况下，如果仍然按照老方法施工，这个工地余下的一半工作量，至少要二十六个月的时间，到1961年4月才能完成，那将大大超过计划竣工的时间。工地党委根据这一新情况，决定大搞技术革新，向工具要劳力。这个工地先后创制出小型机具三十一种共三百多件，全部消灭了人挖、抬、背的现象，每人每天的平均工效由过去的零点五方提高到五方左右。为了进一步发挥这些小型机具的作用，工地党委本着不断革命的精神，又和工程技术人员、工人们进行研究，把这些“单干”的小型机具适当加以改进，组成流水作业线，很快就实现了联动化和自动化，工效又有很大提高。从去年8月起，这个工地每人每日产量平均都在六方以上，今年1月份一跃而达到三十立方米，有的小组甚至突破了一百立方米大关，成为川黔线上快速施工的一面红旗。到2月21日，这个工点已经胜利完工，初步计算，比原计划提前了十三个月，并节约了八十七万多个劳动工日，质量完全符合规格，工程造价比原计划降低64％左右。
    新箩村工地的经验，引起了贵阳铁路局的重视。他们除召开了现场会议，认真总结了这一经验外，还专门派出局党委委员、副局长和总工程师等，组成工作组深入沿线各土石方工地进行推广，并帮助一些工地制定了联动施工的详细规划。通过现场会议和工作组的帮助，许多工地都掀起了大搞联动化施工的革新高潮。现在全线已有一百七十多个土石方工点实现了联动化，二百多个工点也接近联动化的水平。按照川黔铁路的修建计划，原来准备从去年第四季度起增加三万人，现在由于大搞联动化施工，不增加劳动力也能按期完成计划。（附图片）
