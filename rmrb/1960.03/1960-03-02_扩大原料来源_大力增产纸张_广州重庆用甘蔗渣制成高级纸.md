Expand Raw Material Sources, Vigorously Increase Paper Production
Guangzhou and Chongqing Use Sugarcane Bagasse to Make High-Grade Paper

    This newspaper reports: The Guangzhou Paper Mill has successfully used bagasse pulp instead of wood pulp to manufacture newsprint on high-speed paper machines and Fourdrinier paper machines.
    Prior to this, the Guangzhou People's Paper Mill had already used some bagasse pulp mixed with wood pulp to produce newsprint on cylinder paper machines. However, using bagasse pulp instead of wood pulp to make newsprint on Fourdrinier paper machines, especially on high-speed paper machines running at around 400 meters per minute, represents a new development in the utilization of bagasse pulp for papermaking.
    The Guangzhou Paper Mill has traditionally used logs to make pulp and paper. Since the Great Leap Forward, the production capacity of paper machines has continuously increased, leading to a significant rise in the demand for logs. In order to conserve logs, the factory's employees broke away from the superstitious belief that paper could not be made on high-speed paper machines and Fourdrinier paper machines without wood pulp, and boldly adopted bagasse pulp for papermaking. They first experimented with using some bagasse pulp mixed with wood pulp on Fourdrinier paper machines, gaining preliminary experience. Then, they used 95% bagasse pulp and 5% grass pulp on high-speed paper machines to produce newsprint. From then on, they began to use bagasse pulp for papermaking in large quantities. As of January 22, they had produced 4,469 tons of newsprint (mostly mixed with about half bagasse pulp), saving the country over 1,400 cubic meters of wood. The quality of the paper, except for more dust, generally met the requirements in terms of breaking strength and smoothness. Currently, the factory is further researching improvements in quality and increased production.
    This newspaper reports: Chongqing 601 Paper Mill has successfully used 100% sugarcane bagasse to produce offset printing paper, and the quality has reached the required standards. Mass production has already begun.
    Sugarcane bagasse is waste from sugar mills. Its fibers are very short. In the past, it was only used as a low-grade raw material for papermaking, mixed with bamboo and wood raw materials. Most of the bagasse was burned as fuel.

    扩大原料来源  大力增产纸张
    广州重庆用甘蔗渣制成高级纸
    本报讯　广州造纸厂在高速抄纸机和长网纸机上用蔗渣浆代替木浆制造新闻纸成功。
    在此之前，广州人民造纸厂已在圆网纸机上掺用部分蔗渣浆造成新闻纸。而在长网纸机上，特别是在每分钟四百米左右的高速纸机上用蔗渣浆代替木浆造新闻纸，这是利用蔗渣浆造纸的一个新发展。
    广州造纸厂一向是用原木制浆造纸的。大跃进以来，纸机生产能力不断提高，对原木的需用量大大增长。为了节约原木，全厂职工破除了高速纸机和长网纸机不用木浆不能造纸的迷信思想，大胆采用蔗渣浆造纸。他们首先在长网纸机上试用部分蔗渣浆掺木浆造纸，初步取得了经验，接着又在高速抄纸机上用95％的蔗渣浆和5％的草类浆造出了新闻纸。从此他们就开始大量采用蔗渣浆造纸。到1月22日止，已造出四千四百六十九吨新闻纸（大部分掺用一半左右蔗渣浆），共为国家节约木材一千四百多立方米，纸的质量除尘埃较多外，断裂强度和光滑度一般都达到了要求。目前这个厂正在进一步研究改进质量和提高产量。
    本报讯　重庆601造纸厂全部用甘蔗渣制胶版印刷纸成功，质量达到规定标准，目前已开始成批生产。
    甘蔗渣是糖厂的废料，纤维很短，过去只当作造纸的低级原料与竹、木原料掺合使用，大多数的蔗渣被当作燃料烧掉了。
