    Black Mountain Commune Uses Lever Relay Method
    to Draw Water Uphill to Irrigate Wheat Fields
    (Our dispatch) The Black Mountain Commune in Shang County, Shaanxi Province, has adopted the "lever relay method" in its fight against drought, drawing water from ditches up to high mountains to irrigate wheat fields and overcome the drought.
    The "lever relay method" involves erecting supports where there is water at the foot of the mountain, using the principle of levers to draw water from the foot of the mountain to the top. Commune members have erected more than 4,600 "levers" along both banks of the river, drawing water from the river to the high mountains to irrigate wheat fields. As of February 6, all of the commune's more than 15,000 mu of wheat fields and other summer harvest crops had been irrigated once, with land irrigated using the "lever relay method" accounting for one-half of the total, and all mountain slopes that could not be irrigated were watered.

    黑山公社使用杠杆接力法
    提水上山浇灌麦田
    本报讯　陕西省商县黑山公社在抗旱斗争中，采用“杠杆接力法”，把水沟里的水提到高山上灌溉麦田，战胜了干旱。
    “杠杆接力法”是在山下有水的地方立起支架，利用杠杆的原理，把水由山下提到山上。社员在沿河两岸栽起了四千六百多架“杠杆”，把河里的水提上高山，浇灌麦田。截至2月6日，全社一万五千多亩麦田和其它夏收作物田已全部浇灌了一次，其中用“杠杆接力法”浇的地占二分之一，无法灌溉的山坡地全部浇上了水。
