    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th - The spring fishing season production preparations in major coastal fishing areas of Fujian Province have been basically arranged. In areas where the spring fishing season came earlier, more than 106 million catties of various fish and shellfish have been caught in the past 20 days, an increase of 36% compared with the total catch in February of last year.

    This year, the spring fishing season preparations in various fishing areas of Fujian were done earlier and better. The people's communes in the Fu'an Special District gave full play to the advantages of having a large workforce, adopting the method of rotating fishing at sea and combining various fishing gears, changing the past practice of suspending fishing to repair boats and mend nets during the fishing season, and ensuring that both winter fishing production and spring fishing season preparations were carried out simultaneously. When the small yellow croaker fishing season first started, they immediately dispatched their forces to encircle and catch the fish, catching more than 5 million catties in one go, an increase of three to five times compared with the first fishing season in previous years. The coastal communes in the Longxi Special District also used the large amount of funds accumulated during the two years of the Great Leap Forward to further expand the scale of production, successively building more than 200 new fishing boats and 1,900 fishing nets. The entire district caught more than 20 million catties of fish and shellfish in 20 days, overfulfilling the original February production plan by more than double, nine days ahead of schedule.

    In order to support fishery production, all relevant departments in the province, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, carried out the production, procurement, and transportation of fishery production materials in advance. Meteorological and broadcasting departments also built fishing ground meteorological stations and fishermen's broadcasting stations in major fishing areas such as Xiapu, Pingtan, and Dongshan to strengthen weather forecasts and fish condition liaison reports, support fishermen's safe production, and strive for a greater harvest in the spring fishing season.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th - The preparations for the spring fishing season production in the coastal areas of Guangdong Province have been completed, and the vast number of fishermen have gone out to sea to fish.

    This year, the situation of fishery production in Guangdong Province is very good. In January, the province's marine fishing output reached more than 43,000 tons, an increase of 21.8% compared with the same period last year. A new atmosphere of non-slack months has appeared in many areas. In order to realize the continued Great Leap Forward in marine fishery production this year, coastal areas, from the district Party committee and county Party committee to the commune Party committee, have strengthened their leadership over fishery production. Many county Party committee first secretaries have personally gone deep into the fishing areas and fishing boats to inspect work and help solve problems in production. Many communes in coastal areas have drawn more manpower, materials, and funds into fishery production through unified arrangements, simultaneous development of agriculture and fishery, and a combination of professional teams and mass movements. The counties in the Shantou Special District have also carried out large-scale inspections and competitions, set up pace-setters, and organized 55 communes, 159 brigades, and more than 2,900 fishing boats to launch a competition between communes, brigades, boats, and people, creating an unprecedented production situation of chasing and surpassing each other. Many communes, brigades, and boats have rapidly changed their original backward production status through linked competitions. After organizing linked competitions, the fish production of the Dongjie Commune in Raoping County increased sharply from more than 40 dan per day to more than 100 dan, an increase of one and a half times.

    This year's spring fishing season production preparations in coastal areas were also done earlier and more solidly than in previous years. Party committees and aquatic product departments at all levels specifically studied and deployed this year's marine fishery production as early as December last year. Many fishing areas had prepared for fishing at sea before the arrival of the spring fishing season. In this work, in addition to actively changing large and medium-sized fishing boats from double trawls to single trawls (that is, changing two boats trawling into one boat trawling), various localities also carried out technical reforms such as increasing the height of gill nets, operating with lights, and multiple operations by one boat. This year, the fishing boats in Taishan County plan to increase the height of 8,000 gill nets, and more than 5,000 have already been completed. Past experience has proved that increasing the height of gill nets can generally increase production by more than 20% compared with the original low gill nets.

    This year, the power machinery of fishing boats in the province has also increased significantly. At present, the province has more than 27,000 horsepower of fishing boat power machinery, an increase of more than 20,000 horsepower compared with the same period last year. Among them, more than 16,000 horsepower of machinery has been installed and put into production. The rest are also being installed. Various localities have also strengthened the research on fishing season conditions and the communication and liaison of fishing boats going out to sea, and have planned to organize fishing boats to cross ports or transfer fishing ground production according to the changes in the fishing season, chasing or encircling and catching fish schools.

    加添设备　革新技术　扩大捕捞规模
    福建广东渔民乘风破浪迎春汛
    新华社福州29日电　福建省沿海各主要渔区的春汛生产准备工作已经基本上安排停当，春汛来得较早的地区在最近二十天中，已先后捕捞各种鱼贝一亿零六百多万斤，比去年2月份全月的捕捞总数增加了36％。
    今年，福建各地渔区的春汛准备工作作得又早又好。福安专区各渔区公社发挥公社人多力大的优越性，采用轮番出海捕捞和多种网具兼作的方法，改变了过去鱼汛中要歇海修船补网的常规，作到冬汛生产和春汛准备两不误。当小黄鱼鱼汛首次发海时，他们立即出动围捕，一次就捕捞五百多万斤，比往年头汛捕捞量分别增产三倍到五倍。龙溪专区沿海各公社还利用两年大跃进中积累起来的大量资金，进一步扩大了生产规模，先后新造渔船二百多条，渔网一千九百多张。全区二十天中共捕捞了两千多万斤鱼、贝，提前九天超额一倍多完成了原订2月份的生产计划。
    为了支援渔业生产，全区各有关部门在各级党委统一领导下，都提前进行了渔业生产资料的生产、采购和调运工作。气象和广播部门也在霞浦、平潭、东山等主要渔区增建了渔场气象台和渔民广播电台，加强天气预报和鱼情联络报告工作，支援渔民安全生产，争取春汛更大丰收。
    新华社广州29日电　广东省沿海渔民迎接春汛生产的准备工作已经就绪，广大渔民已纷纷出海捕鱼。
    今年广东省渔业生产的形势很好。全省1月份仅海洋捕鱼产量就达四万三千多吨，比去年同期增长了21．8％。许多地区出现了淡月不淡的新气象。为了实现今年海洋渔业生产的继续大跃进，沿海地区从地委、县委到公社党委都加强了对渔业生产的领导，不少县委第一书记亲自深入渔区，深入渔船检查工作，帮助解决生产中的问题。沿海地区许多公社都通过统一安排、农渔并举、专业队与群众运动相结合的办法，抽出更多人力、物力和资金投入渔业生产。汕头专区各县还通过大检查，大评比、树立标兵，组织了五十五个公社、一百五十九个大队、二千九百多条渔船，展开社与社、队与队、船与船、人与人之间的挂勾竞赛，出现了从来未有过的你追我赶的生产局面。许多社、队、船通过挂勾竞赛，迅速改变了原来生产落后的面貌。饶平县东界公社在组织挂勾竞赛后，鱼产量由原来的每天四十多担，激增到一百多担，增长了一倍半。
    今年沿海地区春汛生产的准备工作也比往年做得早，做得扎实。各级党委和水产部门早在去年12月间，就具体研究和部署了今年的海洋渔业生产。许多渔区在春汛到来以前就都作好了出海捕鱼的准备工作。在这一工作中，各地除了积极地将大中型渔船，从双拖改单拖（即两条船拖网生产改为一条船拖网生产）外，还大搞刺网加高、灯光作业，和一船多种作业等技术改革。台山县各渔船今年计划改搞刺网加高八千张，现已完成了五千多张。过去的经验证明，加高刺网一般可比原来的低刺网增产两成多。
    今年全省渔船的动力机器也有很大增加。现在全省拥有的渔船动力机器达二万七千多马力，比去年同期增加了二万多马力。其中，有一万六千多马力的机器，已经安装好投入生产。其余的也正在安装。各地还加强了对渔汛情况的研究和出海渔船的通讯联络，随时根据渔汛的变化，有计划地组织渔船过港或转移渔场生产，追捕或围捕鱼群。
