Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Telegram: The Lanzhou Refinery uses waste gas and waste materials generated during the oil refining process to produce more than ten kinds of products needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.

The factory's employees use a large amount of harmful waste gas discharged during oil refining—methane—to self-burn bricks, tiles, and lime. At the same time, they use discarded equipment to build furnaces to produce carbon black, and then use carbon black and waste oil generated during oil refining as raw materials to make high-quality ink. The employees also collect waste oil from the floors and sewage ponds of various workshops, and after filtering and processing to remove the mud, minerals, and debris inside, they produce several tons of truck oil per month to supply the rural areas. The waste alkali and waste sulfuric acid discharged after processing lubricating oil are also processed into soap powder and agricultural insecticide ferrous sulfate using indigenous methods.

Due to the employees' vigorous engagement in comprehensive utilization, the Lanzhou Refinery has not only produced a large number of products to supply the market, but has also used the income from the sale of these products to equip itself and further develop production.

    兰州炼油厂大搞综合利用
    瓦斯、废油等变成许多种生产和生活必需品
    新华社兰州电　兰州炼油厂利用炼油过程中产生的废气、废物，生产出十多种工农业生产和人民生活需要的产品。
    这个厂的职工利用炼油时排出的大量有害废气——瓦斯，自烧砖瓦和石灰。同时，利用废旧器材建炉生产炭黑，又用炭黑和炼油时产生的废油做原料，制成了质量良好的油墨。职工们还把各车间地上和污水池里的废油收集起来，经过过滤和加工，去掉里面的泥矿和杂物，每月生产几吨大车油供应农村。处理润滑油后排出的废碱、废硫酸，也用土办法加工成肥皂粉和农业用的杀虫剂硫酸亚铁等。
    由于职工们大搞综合利用，兰州炼油厂不但生产了大批产品供应了市场，还利用出售这些产品的收入装备了自己，进一步发展生产。
