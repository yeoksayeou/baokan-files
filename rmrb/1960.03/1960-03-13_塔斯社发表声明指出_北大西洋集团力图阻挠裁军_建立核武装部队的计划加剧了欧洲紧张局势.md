Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: TASS, Moscow – TASS was authorized on March 11th to publish a statement regarding the proposal by Norstad, Supreme Commander of the European Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to establish joint nuclear armed forces in Western Europe. The statement points out that Norstad's proposal, made on the eve of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting, is an attempt to accelerate the implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military plans, thereby not only giving new impetus to the arms race but also creating new obstacles in the path of solving the disarmament problem.

The TASS statement says that the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will begin its work on March 15th of this year. However, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is formulating and implementing measures with completely opposite aims. It is quite clear that General Norstad's announcement of a new plan to establish joint forces equipped with nuclear weapons in Western Europe is intended to further concentrate weapons of mass destruction in this region, which already has a large concentration of armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and many military bases, which are one of the main sources of tension in Europe.

The statement says that now, the leading groups of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are obviously trying to further greatly exacerbate the tense situation and sharpen the mutual relations between European countries.

The statement says that the new plan to establish a "North Atlantic Treaty Organization multinational mobile nuclear force" is, to a large extent, a new form to cover up the conspiracy to carry out nuclear armament of West German militarism and revanchism. Every step taken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to fulfill the demands of West German revanchists and militarists can only lead to a complication of the situation.

The statement says that General Norstad said that the joint nuclear forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization stationed in Europe will be built within twelve months. This shows that the military personnel of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization fear that the upcoming talks on complete and thorough disarmament will reach an agreement on this issue. If an agreement is reached, it goes without saying that it will end the arms race, and thus also stop the implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military plans that harm the people.

The statement concludes by saying that the Soviet people expect that Western countries, especially those who will participate in the upcoming talks on disarmament issues at the Ten-Nation Committee and the summit meeting, will weigh the consequences of any further steps taken to intensify the arms race with due responsibility, and thereby abandon these steps, in order to promote the agreement on complete and thorough disarmament.

### 塔斯社发表声明指出  北大西洋集团力图阻挠裁军  建立核武装部队的计划加剧了欧洲紧张局势

    塔斯社发表声明指出
    北大西洋集团力图阻挠裁军
    建立核武装部队的计划加剧了欧洲紧张局势
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社11日受权就北大西洋公约组织欧洲部队最高统帅诺斯塔德关于在西欧建立联合核武装部队的建议发表了声明。声明指出，诺斯塔德在十国裁军委员会即将开会之前提出这一建议，其企图是为了要更迅速地实现北大西洋公约组织的军事计划，从而不仅给军备竞赛以新的推动力，而且在解决裁军问题的道路上造成新的障碍。
    塔斯社的声明说，十国裁军委员会将于今年3月15日开始工作。但北大西洋公约组织正在制定和实行目的完全相反的措施。十分明显，诺斯塔德将军宣布在西欧建立装备有核武器的联合部队的新计划，是想在这一地区进一步集中大规模毁灭性武器，而这一地区现在已经集中了北大西洋公约组织的大批武装部队，并且建立了许多军事基地，这些基地是欧洲紧张局势的主要根源之一。
    声明说，现在，北大西洋公约组织的领导集团显然力图进一步大大地加剧紧张局势和使欧洲各国之间的互相关系尖锐化。
    声明说，在西欧建立“北大西洋公约组织多国家机动核部队”的新计划，在很大程度上是为了用这种新形式来掩盖对西德军国主义和复仇主义进行核武装的阴谋。北大西洋公约组织为实现西德复仇主义分子和军国主义分子的要求而走的每一步都只能导致局势复杂化。
    声明说，诺斯塔德将军说，北大西洋公约组织驻欧洲的联合核部队将在十二个月内建成。这说明，北大西洋公约组织的军人唯恐即将举行的关于全面彻底裁军的会谈会就这个问题达成协议，而如果达成协议，不用说，就会结束军备竞赛，从而也就会制止实现北大西洋公约组织的危害人民的军事计划。
    声明最后说，苏联人民期望，西方国家，首先是那些将参加即将举行的十国委员会和最高级会议对裁军问题的会谈的西方国家，抱着应有的责任感来权衡在加紧军备竞赛方面采取的任何进一步的步骤的后果，从而放弃这些步骤，以便促进达成全面彻底裁军的协议。（附图片）
