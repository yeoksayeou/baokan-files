Local railways and small foreign railways have opened the door to mobilizing local forces to run railway undertakings. Since Mengxian County, Shanxi Province, established the first local railway, by the end of 1959, in a short period of just over a year, more than 2,400 kilometers of local railways and small foreign railways had been built nationwide. Some were run by provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, some by special districts and counties, and some by factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes. These local railways were built in large numbers, quickly, well, and economically, and have accumulated extremely rich experience. Bengbu Special District in Anhui Province is one example. The district used its own efforts to cast iron rails, build locomotives, and construct roadbeds, connecting mines and steel plants dozens of kilometers away, connecting the Huai River wharf, railway station, and warehouses and factories in the city, and even connecting the market towns of the people's communes with the Huai River wharf. From then on, they were "riding trains on the rails, eliminating all shoulder carrying, and not worrying about rain or snow." This vivid example of Bengbu Special District proves that local railways have many advantages and great potential.

Replacing shoulder carrying with local railways and small foreign railways is a major technological reform in local transportation. It has greatly changed the situation where local transportation capacity could not meet the growing needs of transportation volume, and has saved a large number of laborers. Taking the No. 3 wharf of Bengbu Port as an example, before the construction of the local railway, more than 1,000 flatbed trucks and 1,500 laborers were used, and the daily transportation capacity was still half of the transportation volume required. It took three or four days for ships to complete loading and unloading operations upon arrival. After the construction of the local railway, the transportation capacity doubled, the time for ships to stay in port was only eight hours, and 1,400 laborers and 1,000 flatbed trucks were saved. What a big change this is! At present, local transportation is still a weak link, the labor is heavy, and a large number of people are employed, but it still cannot adapt to the situation of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. It is estimated that there are now more than 10 million local transportation teams nationwide, two-thirds of which are concentrated in wharves, stations, factories, mines, and transportation lines between these material distribution centers, like the No. 3 wharf of Bengbu Port, where the transportation volume is large, the transportation tools are backward, and even shoulder carrying is mostly used. If local railways and small foreign railways are built in these places, calculated according to the proportion of the No. 3 wharf of Bengbu Port, the transportation capacity may be doubled, the backwardness of local transportation can be changed, and tens of millions of laborers can be saved to support industrial and agricultural production. This will be a strong guarantee for the continued leap forward of China's national economy.

Is it possible for local areas to run local railways and small foreign railways on a large scale? Some people once held a skeptical attitude towards this issue. Now is the time to completely dispel this doubt. If, two years ago, not every place was fully equipped with the conditions to run local railways and small foreign railways on a large scale, then after two years of the Great Leap Forward, this situation has changed to a great extent. Now, except for Tibet, all provinces and autonomous regions have built a certain amount of iron and steel industry and machinery industry, and the technical problems of building local railways and small foreign railways have also been gradually resolved. More importantly, after two years of the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of the people are more energetic and high-spirited, and their revolutionary drive and creative spirit are an endless force. Of course, this does not mean that there are no difficulties in running local railways and small foreign railways on a large scale and developing local railway undertakings. There will always be difficulties. But the first thing to be solved is still to liberate the mind and promote the communist style of combining daring to think and act with seeking truth from facts. And to do this, the most important thing is to rely on the party committee to strengthen leadership, seize the existing typical examples, educate the broad masses of cadres and people to recognize their own strength, and enthusiastically devote themselves to the construction of local railways. Bengbu Special District's large-scale local railway construction began with the party committee's support for the Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County to run railways. Under the leadership of the local party committee, the members of this commune gave play to the spirit of daring to think and act, and after they built a small local railway three kilometers long by themselves, the superior party committee seized this typical example and encouraged various places to try it out. Then, five porters successfully made iron rails by using old oil drums as iron-smelting furnaces. Now, with the support of the party committee, this rail-casting factory has developed into a rail-casting factory with more than 300 workers, casting more than 38,000 meters of high-quality iron rails, which can not only run small trains, but also connect with large foreign railways and run large trains. Everyone can imagine, if all people's communes with resource conditions run three kilometers of local railways, what a huge force this would be when added up across the country!

To develop local railways, it is necessary to implement the policy of self-reliance, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, making do with whatever is available, and gradually improving. Funds and materials should be raised locally and built by themselves as much as possible, and after construction, they should also be managed by themselves. When building local railways, it is necessary to be as large as possible if conditions permit, and as small as possible if conditions do not permit; as foreign as possible if conditions permit, and as local as possible if conditions do not permit, according to transportation needs and local conditions. Then, according to the conditions, gradually develop from small to large, from local to foreign. At present, those who have the conditions to build small foreign railways (i.e., light steel rails) can of course build small foreign railways, which are more durable than local railways built with cast iron rails and have a larger transportation capacity. However, when steel and steel products cannot meet the needs of all parties, and many places cannot produce steel and steel products, the use of local iron casting rails can make the development of local railway construction faster and more, and can be put into transportation earlier. Therefore, at present, for most places, the development of local railways should be quickly started using local methods, and should not wait for the conditions for building foreign railways, losing the opportunity. Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces have accumulated a lot of experience in using local iron casting rails. If it is universally promoted across the country, it can not only promote a large number of local railway construction using local methods, but also save a lot of steel.

Of course, emphasizing self-reliance does not mean that the state does not provide assistance, nor does it mean that cooperation between fraternal departments is not needed. Helping local areas build railways is the railway department's unshirkable responsibility. Railway departments in various places have made great efforts in the past to help build local railways. It is an effective way to speed up the construction of local railways for railway departments to use their experience and technical strength to help local areas run local railways. The forces of railway departments in locomotive, vehicle, engineering, and other aspects can also help local areas with surveying, design, and even help with some manufacturing. In this regard, it is particularly important for railway departments to pay attention to helping local areas cultivate technical forces and impart their experience in building and managing railways to them. Anhui has adopted this method. With the support and assistance of the railway bureau, a railway technical force has been trained locally. Some special districts have basically been able to cast iron rails, transform locomotives, manufacture vehicles, and survey and design routes by themselves. Recently, the Ministry of Railways also held an on-site meeting in Bengbu to exchange technical experience in local railways, and further studied and solved the technical problems of building local railways, which provided more favorable conditions for the accelerated development of local railway undertakings.

Local railways not only play a significant role in solving the current transportation problems, but also have broad development prospects. With the large-scale development of local railways, the local railways run by provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, special districts, counties, people's communes, factories, mines, and enterprises will gradually form a local railway network, which will become a part of China's railway network together with the modern railways run by the state. The relationship between these local railway networks and the large railways will be the relationship between trunk and branch, the relationship between network and network, and the relationship between large arteries, branch blood vessels, and capillaries. In the future, some of these local railways will inevitably undergo technical transformation and gradually transition to large railways. Therefore, the running of local railways must have a comprehensive plan, starting from the current transportation needs, first accelerating the construction of local railways in the most urgent areas, such as inside and outside factories and mines, inside and outside ports and stations, between long and short distances, especially in the large number of small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises established since the Great Leap Forward; it is also necessary to foresee the prospects for development. When Bengbu area built local railways that will be connected to large foreign railways in the future, or in places where large foreign railways are planned to be built, they have now built large local railways, so that when conditions are met in the future, they only need to replace the iron rails with steel rails to transition to large foreign railways, or connect with large foreign railways; in sections such as Bengbu Wharf that only connect warehouses and factories and do not connect with large foreign railways, the transportation volume is small and relatively fixed, medium-sized local railways have been built; in sections with smaller transportation volumes such as Hongqi Commune, small local railways have been built. Such planning and arrangement is reasonable. From the effect point of view, for railways connected to large foreign railways, building large local railways, large trains can directly reach factories, saving several loading and unloading procedures and saving a lot of labor. From the cost point of view, the cost per kilometer of local railways and small foreign railways is only one-tenth to one-fifth of that of large foreign railways, while the cost of small local railways is only one-fifth of that of large local railways. This planning and arrangement of Bengbu Special District provides a good experience for various places to carry out the planning work of local railways.

At present, national industrial and agricultural production is in a vigorous upsurge, and the number of materials that need to be transported is increasing. Local railways must be built, and should be built more, faster, and earlier. Which region can build more, faster, and better on the premise of completing the state's steel tasks, that region will be more proactive in transportation and can save more labor, so that the situation of continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production can be better developed.

    地方铁路大有可为
    土铁路和小洋铁路的出现，为动员地方的力量兴办铁路事业打开了大门。自从山西盂县创办第一条土铁路以来，到1959年底，短短一年多的时间，全国已经建成了二千四百多公里土铁路和小洋铁路。其中有省、市、自治区办的，有专区和县办的，也有厂矿企业和人民公社办的。这些地方铁路办得又多又快又好又省，取得了极其丰富的经验。安徽省蚌埠专区就是一个例子。这个专区用自力更生的办法，铸铁轨、造机车、筑路基，把数十公里以外的矿山和钢铁厂连结起来，把淮河码头、火车站和市内的仓库、工厂连结起来，甚至把人民公社的集镇和淮河码头也连结起来，从此是“驾着列车轨上跑，肩挑人抬全取消，下雨下雪不心焦”。蚌埠专区的这一生动事例，证明了地方铁路好处极多，大有可为。
    用土铁路和小洋铁路代替肩挑人抬，是地方运输事业的一项重大技术改革，它在很大程度上改变了地方运输的运力远远不能适应运量增长需要的情况，并且节省出大批的劳动力。拿蚌埠港的三号码头来说，在修土铁路前，用了一千多辆平板车，一千五百个劳动力，每天的运输能力同运量需要仍然相差一倍，船舶到港要三、四天时间才能完成装卸作业。修建土铁路以后，运输能力提高了一倍，船舶停港时间只要八小时就够了，还节约出一千四百个劳动力和一千辆平板车。这是多么大的变化啊！现在，地方运输仍然是一个薄弱环节，劳动繁重，占用人力数量很大，而又远远不能同工农业生产继续跃进的形势相适应。据估计，现在全国地方运输队伍达一千多万人，有三分之二都集中在像蚌埠港三号码头这类运输量很大、运输工具落后、甚至大部采用肩挑人抬的码头、车站、厂矿和这些物资集散点之间的运输线路上。如果在这些地方修建土铁路和小洋铁路，按蚌埠港三号码头那样的比例计算，就可能把运力提高一倍，改变地方运输的落后面貌，并且可以节约出上千万个劳动力支援工农业生产。这对我国国民经济的继续跃进将是一个有力的保证。
    地方上有没有可能大办土铁路和小洋铁路呢？有些人曾经对这个问题抱着怀疑的态度。现在应该是彻底打消这种怀疑的时候了。如果说，两年以前，还不是每一个地方都充分具备了大办土铁路和小洋铁路的条件，那么，经过两年的大跃进，这种情况已经有了很大程度的改变。现在，全国除西藏外，各个省和自治区都建设有一定的钢铁工业和机械工业，建设土铁路和小洋铁路的技术问题也逐步得到解决。更重要的是，经过两年的大跃进，广大人民群众更加精神振奋，斗志昂扬，他们的革命干劲和创造精神是一股无穷无尽的力量。当然，这并不是说大办土铁路和小洋铁路、发展地方铁路事业就没有任何困难了。困难总是会有的。但是首先需要解决的仍然是解放思想，发扬敢想敢干和实事求是相结合的共产主义风格。而要做到这点，最重要的是依靠党委加强领导，抓住已有的典型事例，教育广大干部和群众认识自己的力量，热情地投身到地方铁路的建设事业中去。蚌埠专区大办地方铁路，就是从党委支持怀远县红旗人民公社办铁路开始的。这个公社的社员，在当地党委领导下，发挥了敢想敢干的精神，自己办成一条三公里长的小土铁路后，上级党委便抓住这一典型，鼓励各地试办。接着便出现了五个搬运工人用旧油桶作化铁炉铸造铁轨成功的事情。现在这个铸轨厂在党委支持下，已发展成有三百多工人的铸轨工厂，铸造出优质铁轨三万八千多米，不但能走小火车，而且能和大洋铁路相连，走大火车。大家可以设想，如果凡是具备资源条件的人民公社，都办三公里的土铁路，全国总计起来，这是多么巨大的力量啊！
    发展地方铁路，必须实行自力更生、就地取材、因地制宜、因陋就简、逐步提高的方针。资金、材料要尽可能在地方上自筹，自己修建，建好以后，也由自己来管理。在修建地方铁路时，要根据运输需要和当地条件的可能，能大就大，不能大就小，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，然后根据条件，逐步从小到大，从土到洋。在目前来说，能有条件建设小洋铁路（即轻型钢轨）的，当然可以修建小洋铁路，它比生铁铸轨修建的土铁路要经久耐用，运量也较大。但是，在目前钢和钢材还不能满足各方面的需要，而许多地方还不能生产钢和钢材的时候，采用土铁铸轨，就能使地方铁路建设事业发展得更快、更多，能够更早投入运输。所以，在目前，对大多数地方来说，发展地方铁路应该迅速土法上马，不应坐等修建洋铁路的条件，失掉良机。安徽、河南、山东、山西等省，对采用土铁铸轨，都已积累了许多经验，如果全国普遍推广，既能促成大量地方铁路土法上马，又能大量节约钢材。
    当然，强调自力更生，并不是说国家不加帮助，也不是说不要兄弟部门的协作。帮助地方上修建铁路是铁路部门义不容辞的责任。各地铁路部门过去对帮助兴修地方铁路已经尽了很大努力。铁路部门用自己的经验和技术力量，帮助地方办地方铁路，是加快地方铁路建设的有效办法。铁路部门的机务、车辆、工务、工程等方面的力量，也是能够帮助地方勘测、设计、甚至帮助进行部分制造的。在这方面，特别重要的是铁路部门要注意帮助地方培养技术力量，向他们传授建设和管理铁路的经验。安徽采取这个办法，在铁路局的支援、帮助下，地方上已经培养出一支铁路技术力量，有的专区已经基本上能够自己铸造铁轨、改造机车、制造车辆和勘测设计路线。最近铁道部在蚌埠还召开了地方铁路技术经验交流现场会议，对修建地方铁路的技术问题作了进一步的研究和解决，这对于地方铁路事业的加速发展提供了更加有利的条件。
    地方铁路不只对解决当前的运输问题有重大作用，而且有着远大的发展前景。随着地方铁路的大发展，各省、市、自治区办的、专区办的、县办的、人民公社办的、厂矿企业办的地方铁路，将逐步构成一个地方铁路网，同国家举办的现代化铁路一起，成为我国铁路网。这些地方铁路网和大铁路的关系将是干与支的关系，网与络的关系，大动脉、支血管和微血管的关系。将来，这些地方铁路也必然会有一部分经过技术改造，逐步过渡为大铁路。因此，地方铁路的举办，一定要有全面规划，既从当前的运输需要出发，首先在最急需的地区，例如厂矿内外、港站内外、长短途之间、特别是大跃进以来建立的大量中小型工矿企业方面，加快地方铁路的建设；也要预见到发展的前景。蚌埠地区在修建将来要和大洋铁路相接的土铁路时，或者是在准备修建大洋铁路的地方，现在就都修了大型土铁路，以便将来条件具备时只需把铁轨换成钢轨，就过渡到大洋铁路，或同大洋铁路接轨；在蚌埠码头等只通仓库和工厂，不和大洋铁路相接，运量较少也比较固定的地段，就修建了中型土铁路；在红旗公社等运量更小的地段，便修建了小型土铁路。这样的规划和安排是合理的。从效果上看，和大洋铁路相接的铁路，建成大型的土铁路，大火车可以一直通到工厂，能省去几道装卸的手续，节约大量劳力。从成本上看，土铁路和小洋铁路每公里的造价，只为大洋铁路的十分之一到五分之一，而小土铁路的造价则只有大土铁路的五分之一。蚌埠专区的这种规划和安排，为各地进行地方铁路的规划工作，提供了很好的经验。
    现在，全国工农业生产正处在一个蓬蓬勃勃的高潮中，需要运输的物资数量越来越大。地方铁路势在必办，而且应该多办、快办、早办。哪个地区能在完成国家钢铁任务的前提下，办得多，办得快，办得好，那个地区就能在运输中更加主动，并能节约更多的劳动力，使工农业生产继续跃进的形势得到更好的发展。
