Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 29th: Anhui Province's steel enterprises modestly learned from the advanced steelmaking experiences of the entire nation, vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, and completed the February steel and steel material production plan two days ahead of schedule; the qualification rate of both steel and steel materials was above 90%.

In February, Anhui's steel plants universally promoted the advanced operational methods of converter steelmaking used nationwide. These advanced experiences included low-slag operation, high-temperature thin-slag operation, etc. Therefore, the output and quality of steel were greatly improved. After adopting high-temperature thin-slag operation, the qualification rate of steel produced by the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant increased to over 95%. At the same time, the steel plants also widely carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The staff and workers of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant alone proposed 1,252 innovation projects this month, and a large number of rationalization proposals were quickly implemented, solving many key production problems.

In terms of steel rolling, units such as the Hefei Special Steel Plant and the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's rolling mill installed retaining plates on 300mm rolling mills, increasing work efficiency more than fivefold.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: As of the 26th, the small-scale local iron and steel plants in the Xuchang area of Henan Province had overfulfilled the February pig iron production plan by 2,717 tons. The average daily output increased by 26% compared with the same period in January. The pig iron qualification rate reached 97%, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces increased to 1.3, and the coke consumption per ton of iron and costs decreased significantly.

After overfulfilling the January pig iron production plan, the small-scale local iron and steel plants in the Xuchang area immediately took measures to ensure the production leap forward in February. While vigorously grasping the technical transformation of blast furnaces and improving the utilization coefficient, they conscientiously implemented the measures of grasping production on the one hand and capital construction on the other, and seized the work of blast furnace construction, supporting facilities, and putting them into production. As a result, the average daily pig iron output in the entire region in early February increased by 20.9% compared with late January; the average daily output in mid-February increased by another 16.7% compared with early February.

    钢花红胜二月花
    安徽钢和钢材生产提前完成上月计划
    许昌地区生铁日产量比1月提高四分之一
    新华社合肥29日电　安徽省钢铁企业虚心学习全国炼钢先进经验，大闹技术革新和技术革命，提前两天完成2月份钢和钢材生产计划；钢和钢材的合格率都在90％以上。
    2月份，安徽各炼钢厂普遍推广了全国转炉炼钢的先进操作方法。这些先进经验包括小渣量操作、高温薄渣操作等。因此大大提高了钢的产量和质量。马鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂采用高温薄渣操作后，钢的合格率提高到95％以上。与此同时，各钢厂还广泛地开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，仅马鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂职工，这个月就提出了一千二百五十二项革新项目，大量合理化建议迅速实现，解决了许多生产关键问题。
    在轧钢方面，合肥特殊钢厂、马鞍山钢铁公司轧钢厂等单位，都在三百毫米轧机上安装了围盘，提高工效五倍以上。
    新华社郑州29日电　河南省许昌地区的小洋群钢铁厂到26日止，超额二千七百一十七吨完成了2月份生铁产量计划，平均日产量比1月份同期增长26％，生铁合格率达到97％，高炉平均利用系数提高到一点三，吨铁耗焦量和成本都有显著下降。
    许昌地区的小洋群钢铁厂超额完成1月份生铁生产计划后，就立即采取措施保证2月份的生产跃进。他们在大抓高炉技术改造和提高利用系数的同时，认真执行了一手抓生产一手抓基建的措施，抓紧进行高炉建设、配套和投入生产的工作。因此，2月上旬全区生铁平均日产量比1月下旬提高20．9％；2月中旬的平均日产量又比2月上旬提高16．7％。
