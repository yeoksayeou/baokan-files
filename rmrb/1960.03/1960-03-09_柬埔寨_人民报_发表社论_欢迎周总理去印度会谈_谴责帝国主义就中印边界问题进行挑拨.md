Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 8th: The Cambodian "People's Daily" published an editorial today welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming meeting with Prime Minister Nehru in India, and forcefully exposed the imperialists' attempts to use the border dispute between China and India to incite anti-China hysteria and create discord between the two countries.

The editorial pointed out that the growing consolidation and development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit are beneficial to the peace, democracy, and national independence movements in Asia and the world. However, this has become a huge disaster for imperialists and warmongers.

The editorial said that China has become a member of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and it is also a sincere friend of newly independent or struggling for independence countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This has aroused the fear of the imperialist bloc. Precisely because of this, imperialists and their lackeys are carrying out deceptive propaganda, saying that China is an "aggressor" that ostensibly adopts a policy of non-interference. The newspaper pointed out that this deceptive propaganda cannot fool anyone. Because China's territory of Taiwan is still under the occupation of U.S. imperialism, this propaganda is nothing more than the "thief crying 'stop thief!'"

The editorial exposed the imperialists' attempts to sow discord over the border dispute between China and India by all means. It said that the Chinese and Indian people have not been deceived. The editorial said that the Chinese government has proposed holding talks with the Indian government, and Premier Zhou Enlai's recent reply to Prime Minister Nehru, in which he proposed to go to New Delhi in April, demonstrates the sincerity of the People's China, and shows the world that the People's China has never been an "aggressor" against other countries, but a truly peace-loving country. This attitude of the Chinese government, full of friendship and faithful to international cooperation, makes the peace-loving Asian and African countries, including Cambodia, happy, and they hope that the future Sino-Indian talks will be successful.

    柬埔寨“人民报”发表社论
    欢迎周总理去印度会谈
    谴责帝国主义就中印边界问题进行挑拨
    新华社金边8日电　柬埔寨“人民报”今天发表社论，欢迎周恩来总理将去印度同尼赫鲁总理举行会晤，并且有力地揭露了帝国主义者企图利用中印两国之间的边界纠纷煽动反华歇斯底里，在中印两国间制造不和。
    社论指出，和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的日益巩固和发展，有利于亚洲和世界的和平民主运动和民族独立运动。但是这却成为帝国主义者和战争贩子的巨大的灾难。
    社论说，中国已经成为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的一员，它又是新近独立或正在为独立而斗争的亚非和拉丁美洲国家的真诚朋友，这引起了帝国主义集团的恐惧。正因为这样，帝国主义者及其走狗们就进行欺骗宣传说，中国是表面上采取不干涉态度的“侵略者”。这家报纸指出，这种欺骗宣传是骗不了任何人的。因为中国的领土台湾仍然在美帝国主义占领之下，所以这种宣传不过是“贼喊捉贼”。
    社论揭露帝国主义者千方百计地企图就中国同印度之间的边界争端进行挑拨。它说，中国和印度人民都没有受骗。社论说，中国政府建议同印度政府举行会谈，周恩来总理最近给尼赫鲁总理的复信中又提出在4月间前往新德里，这表明了人民中国的诚意，并向全世界表明，人民中国从来不是对其它国家的“侵略者”，而是一个真正爱好和平的国家。中国政府的这种充满友谊、忠于国际合作的态度，使包括柬埔寨在内的爱好和平的亚非国家感到高兴，它们希望未来的中印会谈将获得成功。
