    Get Through the Spring Feed Barrier
    Our Commentator

    Better solving the pig feed problem, especially the spring feed problem, is one of the fundamental keys to developing the pig-raising industry at high speed. Every year in the spring, because green and roughage feeds have not yet grown, and the feed stored in the past has been mostly used up, pig feed has always been relatively scarce during this period. Many places call the period from March to May the feed barrier for pig raising. Last autumn and winter, the amount of green and roughage feed stored in various places was much larger than in previous years. However, due to the Great Leap Forward in pig raising, the pig feed in some areas is relatively tight. Breaking through the spring feed barrier has become a prominent issue in these areas. Solving this problem well can not only consolidate the achievements of pig raising since last year but also prepare a strong material foundation for a greater leap forward in the pig industry this year.

    It should be admitted that breaking through the spring feed barrier has certain difficulties. For example, due to climatic reasons, wild feed for pigs has not yet been produced or has not yet grown, and the busy spring plowing season has arrived, labor is tight, and it is not easy to arrange labor for feed production, and so on. However, this is only one aspect of the problem, and it is a secondary and non-essential aspect. There are still many favorable conditions for solving the feed problem in the spring. The successive bumper harvests of the past two years have not only given us more grain and other agricultural products than in the past but also given us more agricultural by-products. Many by-products can be used as good feed with a little processing. In addition, with the great development of agricultural product processing industries in people's communes in various places, many by-products can be used as feed after processing. All these are good conditions for us to solve the spring feed problem. Therefore, the problem lies in having a lot of drive and fully mobilizing the masses. In fact, many places have closely relied on the masses to solve the spring feed problem. For example, in Liaoning and Heilongjiang, where it is cold and freezing, a mass movement of "getting feed from the yards" and "getting feed from the fields" has been launched. In Fakou County, Liaoning Province, more than 10 million catties of refined and roughage feed were collected in a few days. In Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, more than 10,000 people were mobilized to dig up more than 20 million catties of substitute feed and pick up more than 6 million catties of vegetable leaves, vegetable stalks, and beet seedlings, which is enough for more than 90,000 pigs in the county to eat for three months. The southern regions, with their mild climate and evergreen seasons, can not only collect large amounts of agricultural by-products to solve the feed problem like the northeastern regions but also make full use of the superior natural conditions to grow special green feed crops. Sichuan Province mobilized the masses to engage in "full mountain greening," making use of river banks, roadsides, and barren slopes to grow vegetables and using vegetable feet and vegetable skins to feed pigs. Hunan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and other places also reclaimed a lot of wasteland, reclaiming and planting various high-yield, fast-growing, and early-maturing early spring crops and vegetables to solve the spring feed problem. From this, it can be seen that whether it is the north, where the weather is colder and plants have not yet grown, or the south, which is evergreen and lush with vegetation, as long as we grasp the characteristics of each place, closely rely on the masses, and take measures that are appropriate to local conditions, grasp firmly, grasp early, and grasp to the end, the spring feed problem can be completely solved.

    Fully utilizing and processing agricultural by-products is the main source for solving the spring feed problem. Many agricultural by-products that were previously considered unusable as feed are now good feed. For example, rice straw roots, rice straw slurry, corn stalks, as well as cotton shells, sunflower heads, rape shells, and stalks, etc., these things were always burned as fuel in the past, but once the masses were mobilized, ways were found, and tricks were found, they all became good feed.

    The green manure planted in the southern provinces is good fertilizer and also good feed. According to research by agricultural science departments, it contains rich protein. One catty and two taels of purple vetch contains nutrients equivalent to one catty of wheat bran. Therefore, using a small portion of green manure as pig feed, such as using 15%, would yield 33.5 billion catties nationwide. Feeding each pig 100 catties could solve the feed problem for 60 million pigs in green manure planting areas for three months. Some people think that doing so will affect grain production. In fact, according to scientific experiments, if the green manure grows very well and is all used as fertilizer, it is not only unfavorable but also harmful to crops. Too much green manure can easily cause crops to lodge and reduce yields. On the contrary, using a small portion of green manure as feed, which both fattens the pigs and provides pig manure for the fields, kills two birds with one stone. We should well summarize and promote experience in this regard.

    Spring plowing production activities are about to fully unfold. Various places are formulating or revising production plans. People's communes and production teams should arrange for the whole year's feed production according to this year's pig-raising leap forward plan. At present, we should adopt more methods such as reclaiming wasteland, intercropping, interplanting, and crop rotation to plant more high-yield feed crops. This is a major event and cannot be taken lightly in the slightest.

    过好春季饲料关
    本报评论员
    更好地解决猪的饲料特别是春季饲料问题，是当前高速度发展养猪事业的根本关键之一。每年春季，由于青粗饲料还没有生长起来，过去贮存的饲料又已经用去大部分，历来这段时间的猪饲料都较缺乏。很多地方都把3月到5月这段时间称为养猪的饲料关。去年秋冬各地贮存的青粗饲料比往年要多得多。但由于养猪的大跃进，一部分地区的猪饲料比较紧张。突破春季饲料关，就成为这些地区当前的一个突出问题。这一问题解决得好，不仅可以巩固去年以来的养猪成果，还可以为今年养猪业的更大跃进准备好有力的物质基础。
    应该承认，突破春季饲料关，是有一定困难的，譬如由于气候关系，可供养猪的野生饲料还没有生产出来或还没有长成，以及春耕大忙季节已经来临，劳力紧张，不好安排饲料生产的劳力等等。但是，这只是问题的一个方面，而且是次要的非本质的方面。在春季解决饲料的有利条件还是多得很的，连续两年的大丰收，不仅使我们取得了比过去更多的粮食和其他农产品，也使我们有了更多的农业副产品，许多副产品只要稍加加工，都是很好的饲料。加上各地人民公社农产品加工工业的大发展，许多副产品经过加工都可以当作饲料，如此等等都是我们解决春季饲料的大好条件。因此，问题在于要有一股很大的干劲和充分发动群众。事实上，已有许多地方紧紧依靠群众，解决了春季饲料问题。譬如在天寒地冻的辽宁和黑龙江，开展了“向场院要饲料”、“向田野要饲料”的群众运动。辽宁省法库县几天内收集了精粗饲料一千多万斤。黑龙江省呼兰县发动群众一万多人，十天内挖出代用饲料两千多万斤，拣回菜叶、菜帮、甜菜缨子六百多万斤，够全县现有的九万多头猪吃三个月。气候温和、四季常青的南方地区不仅可以像东北地区那样大量收集农副产品来解决饲料问题，还可以充分利用优越的自然条件大种特种青饲料。四川省发动群众大搞满山青，利用河边、路边和荒坡隙地大种蔬菜，用菜脚，菜皮来喂猪。湖南、广东、云南等地也大量开荒，边开荒边种各种高产、生长快、成熟早的早春作物和蔬菜，来解决春季的饲料问题。由此看来，无论是天气较冷，植物还没有生长出来的北方，也无论是一年常青、草木繁茂的南方，只要抓住各地的特点，紧紧依靠群众，采取因地制宜的办法，狠抓，早抓，一抓到底，春季饲料问题完全可以解决。
    充分利用和加工农副产品是当前解决春季饲料的主要来源。许多过去被认为不能做饲料的农副产品，现在都成为很好的饲料。例如稻草根、稻草浆、玉米秸，还有棉花壳、葵花头、油菜壳秆等等，这些东西过去一直被当作燃料烧掉，一经发动群众，想办法、找窍门，都变成了好饲料。
    南方各省种植的绿肥，是好肥料，也是好饲料。据农业科学部门研究，它含有丰富的蛋白质，一斤二两紫云英，所含营养相当于一斤麸皮。因此利用一小部分绿肥做猪饲料，譬如利用15％，全国即有三百三十五亿斤，按每头猪喂一百斤，就可以解决种植绿肥地区六千万头猪三个月的饲料。有人认为这样做影响粮食增产，其实，根据科学试验，如果绿肥长得很好，全部用来作肥料，这不仅对农作物不利而且有害，绿肥过多作物容易发生倒伏，产量减低。相反的，利用一小部分绿肥用作饲料，既养肥了猪，又有猪粪下田，一举两得。我们应该很好总结和推广这方面的经验。
    春耕生产活动即将全面展开，各地正在制定或修改生产计划，人民公社和生产队应该根据今年养猪的跃进计划，安排好全年的饲料生产。当前要更多采用开荒、间种、套种、轮种等等办法，多种高产饲料作物，这是一件大事，不能有丝毫轻视。
