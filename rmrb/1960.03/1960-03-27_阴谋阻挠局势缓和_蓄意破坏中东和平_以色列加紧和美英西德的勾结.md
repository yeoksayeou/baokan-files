    Plotting to Hinder the Relaxation of the Situation; Deliberately Undermining Middle East Peace
    Israel Intensifies Collusion with the US, UK, and West Germany
    (Dispatch) Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion has recently intensified his collusion with the United States, Britain, and West Germany.

    After a seven-day visit to Britain, Ben-Gurion left for home on the 23rd. According to reports, Ben-Gurion and Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Shimon Peres, who visited London a few weeks ago, both made requests to the British authorities regarding the supply of weapons from Britain. Britain is considering providing Israel with anti-aircraft missiles.

    Prior to this, Ben-Gurion visited the United States for more than a week and held talks with Eisenhower, Nixon, and Herter. After his meeting with Eisenhower, he went to great lengths to tout the aggressive policies of the United States and attacked the United Arab Republic. According to Western news agencies, Ben-Gurion, while in the United States, requested to purchase missiles and tanks to equip the Israeli army.

    In addition, Ben-Gurion also made contact with West German Chancellor Adenauer, who was visiting the United States. According to foreign newspapers, Ben-Gurion, in his secret talks with Adenauer, requested West German assistance in arming Israel to oppose Arab countries.

    From all indications, Ben-Gurion's trip to Europe and the United States was clearly to further collude with the governments of the United States and Britain and the Adenauer clique in order to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation and undermine peace in the Middle East.

    Ben-Gurion's conspiratorial activities have been condemned by public opinion both inside and outside Israel. The Israeli Communist Party pointed out that Ben-Gurion's main purpose is to strengthen Israel's political, economic, and military ties with imperialist countries. Arab public opinion has condemned Ben-Gurion's intensified sinister schemes against Arab countries. An article published in the Soviet "Pravda" wrote: The Israeli ruling clique is once again acting as a tool in the hands of the Western bloc, which is unwilling to abandon its colonial intentions in the Near East.

    阴谋阻挠局势缓和　蓄意破坏中东和平
    以色列加紧和美英西德的勾结
    本报讯　以色列总理本—古里安最近加紧与美国、英国和西德进行勾结。
    本—古里安在英国访问了七天之后，已于23日离英回国。据报道，本—古里安和几个星期以前来伦敦访问的以色列国防部副部长佩雷斯都向英国当局提出了关于由英国供应武器的要求。英国正在考虑给以色列防空导弹。
    在此之前，本—古里安在美国访问了一个多星期，并曾同艾森豪威尔、尼克松和赫脱举行了会谈。他在同艾森豪威尔会谈以后，竭力为美国的侵略政策吹嘘，并且对阿拉伯联合共和国进行了攻击。据西方通讯社透露，本—古里安在美国时，曾经要求购买导弹和坦克来装备以色列军队。
    此外，本—古里安还同正在美国访问的西德总理阿登纳进行了接触。据外国报纸揭露，本—古里安在同阿登纳的密谈中曾要求西德帮助武装以色列来反对阿拉伯国家。
    从各方面的消息看来，本—古里安的这次欧美之行，显然是为了同美英两国政府和阿登纳集团进行进一步的勾结，以便阻挠国际局势缓和和破坏中东和平。
    本—古里安的这种阴谋活动已经受到了以色列国内外舆论的谴责。以色列共产党指出，本—古里安的主要目的是要加强以色列同帝国主义国家在政治、经济和军事方面的联系。阿拉伯国家的舆论谴责本—古里安加紧反对阿拉伯国家的罪恶阴谋。苏联“真理报”发表的文章写道：以色列统治集团又在充当西方集团手中的工具，这个集团不愿意放弃它们在近东的殖民意图。
