    Everyone Take Action, Vigorously Launch the Patriotic Health Campaign

    Today, this newspaper published the "Notice of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Ministry of Health on Organizing a Spring Patriotic Health Campaign General Inspection." A new high tide of the patriotic health campaign is about to arrive. Health work is an important component of China's overall leap forward. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance to health work. Health work is important because it is conducive to production, work, and study, and helps to transform the weak physique of the Chinese people, making everyone healthy and the environment clean, closely combining with and mutually promoting the great leap forward in production and the cultural and technological revolution. Precisely because of this, health work has the great significance of transforming customs and habits and transforming the world. Currently, China's industrial and agricultural production is continuing to leap forward at high speed, and a high tide of the cultural and technological revolution is forming across the country. Health work must accelerate to adapt to this new situation. Recently, Beijing, Shanghai, Hunan, and other places have launched unprecedented large-scale patriotic health campaigns. All parts of the country should, without exception, immediately take action, publicize widely, create momentum, eliminate the four pests, and launch a vigorous new high tide in the health campaign across the country.

    In recent years, especially since 1958, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, China's health work has achieved great achievements in coordination with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the development of the people's commune movement. The four pests in various places have been greatly reduced. Major diseases that seriously endanger people's health have been eliminated or reduced at an astonishing rate. Smallpox, plague, and kala-azar have been basically eliminated. The prevention and control of schistosomiasis have achieved great victories. By September last year, more than 4.9 million patients nationwide had received treatment, accounting for 70% of the total number of patients. The epidemic areas of diseases such as malaria, hookworm disease, and filariasis are rapidly shrinking. The environmental sanitation in many cities and rural areas has been greatly improved, and the masses have initially developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene. The spiritual outlook of the people in these areas has been completely renewed. Jishan County in Shanxi Province has now basically eliminated the four pests. It has not only eliminated and controlled major and common diseases that seriously endanger the people, but has also developed into comprehensive investigations and treatment of general diseases; not only conducts health care work for the people, but also carries out epidemic prevention and health care work for livestock and poultry. They adapt to the characteristics of the collectivization of commune production and life, and establish new grassroots health care networks in emerging factories, pastures, forest farms, water conservancy construction sites, public canteens, nurseries, and other collective production and welfare units. They also combine the basic construction of health work with the construction of socialist new villages, such as beautification with flowers, greening, beautification, and the renovation of houses and streets. Paying attention to hygiene, breaking superstitions, and believing in science have become new social customs in the area. Foshan City in Guangdong Province is an ancient city with extremely poor sanitary conditions before liberation. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, through large-scale mass movements, the city's environmental sanitation has been fundamentally changed, becoming a red banner in urban health work. There are many other advanced health areas with different characteristics across the country. These red flags of health work are powerful proof of the great achievements made in China's health campaign.

    However, we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. The fundamental requirement of our health campaign is to achieve the goals of eliminating diseases, inspiring everyone, transforming customs and habits, and transforming the country. We must not only transform our spiritual outlook and establish a communist ideological style, but also change our weak physique and train ourselves to become healthy people. Obviously, the achievements of our health work are still quite far from this requirement. With the rapid development of the situation and the gradual deepening of health work, the content of health work has also become richer. We must continue to vigorously carry out the work of eliminating pests and diseases. The current slogan for eliminating the four pests is: "Eliminate rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes." We must eliminate the four pests in a short period of time, improve environmental sanitation, and ensure that everyone develops healthy habits. At the same time, we must also start from the positive side and strengthen mass sports activities. Everyone who can participate in sports activities should participate in gymnastics, ball games, running, mountain climbing, swimming, Tai Chi, and various other sports. This is the glorious task that the new situation brings to health work.

    The key to carrying out a vigorous patriotic health campaign lies in strengthening the leadership of local Party committees, with the first secretary taking the lead, immediately grasping the deployment, grasping the summary of experience, grasping the inspection, competition, and evaluation, fully mobilizing the masses, and coordinating with the production movement to vigorously carry out health work. We must use the experience of advanced areas in national health work and publicize it widely. We must explain to the broad masses of cadres and people that when production, work, and study are tense, there is an even greater need for a healthy body. Only by arranging health work properly and strengthening people's bodies can we further promote the leap forward in production, work, and study. Jishan County is a model county in health work in Shanxi Province, and also a model county for high wheat yields. After the severe drought last year, it still increased production by 32%. They did a good job in health work, enhanced the people's physique, increased attendance rates, increased production efficiency, and thus promoted the leap forward in production. It is wrong to regard health work as an isolated task. Health work must start from production, work, and study, and serve production, work, and study. The leap forward in production, work, and study also promotes the leap forward in health work. Taking the current situation as an example, the national technical revolution and technological innovation movement has greatly reduced the labor intensity of many factories and rural areas and improved working conditions, which has a direct impact on promoting the health of the working people. For example, the better people study and the richer their cultural and scientific knowledge, the more consciously they will pay attention to hygiene and health. This is the dialectical unity between production, work, study, and health work.

    Doing a good job in environmental and personal hygiene and carrying out sports activities are also the demands of the masses. Only by relying on a large-scale mass movement can this important task be successfully achieved. Chairman Mao said in his article "The United Front in Cultural Work": "We must tell the masses to rise up and fight against their own illiteracy, superstition, and unsanitary habits." The happy life of the people can only be created by the people's own hands. Therefore, a large-scale health campaign must be publicized widely, so that everyone knows it and everyone takes action. Everything depends on human effort. As long as the people have great revolutionary enthusiasm, all difficulties will be overcome. All health and medical personnel must actively take action, closely combine with the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the Party, actively and proactively stand in front of the health campaign, teach health knowledge and technology to the broad masses of the people, and take on the task of sentinel and technical guidance in health work. We must make full use of newspapers, periodicals, radio, movies, dramas, folk arts, and other forms, combined with literacy campaigns, spare-time education, school education, and other tasks, to vigorously carry out publicity and education work.

    Everyone should be mobilized to participate in the new high tide of the health campaign. Whether it is the elderly, children, young people, adults, teachers, students, men, or women, they should all hold fly swatters and other tools as much as possible, eliminate the four pests, vigorously carry out hygiene, develop healthy habits, and establish a social custom of "taking hygiene as glory and taking unsanitary as shame."

    It is currently spring, and mosquitoes and flies are about to breed in large numbers, and diseases are extremely easy to spread. Party committees at all levels in various places should seize the opportunity, coordinate with various tasks such as production and work, and immediately mobilize the entire party and all the people to take action. First, we must launch a large-scale offensive against rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes, and other disease-causing pests. Eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, and strive to have more large "four-without" areas this year. In order to adapt to the new situation of collectivization of people's lives, both urban and rural areas must attach great importance to doing a good job in the health work of collective production and life. Labor protection and health work in industrial and mining, fields, and water conservancy transportation construction sites must be done well. Workers and farmers should eat well, sleep well, be safe when working, and be happy when resting. In life, special attention should be paid to the health work of canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries, and the health education or training of childcare workers and cooks should be strengthened, so that everyone eats clean and hygienically, and prevents various infectious diseases and food poisoning. Improving environmental sanitation in urban and rural areas is a very effective way to eliminate pests and diseases. All localities should combine pig raising, fertilizer accumulation, greening, road repair, and basic construction such as production and life to improve environmental sanitation. Harmless treatment of garbage and sewage should be carried out, especially the proper treatment of human feces, which is the most effective way to prevent mosquitoes and flies from breeding, which is of great significance for eliminating parasitic diseases, and this matter must be done well. In addition, all localities should vigorously publicize health knowledge through various means, so that residents can quickly develop healthy habits. In terms of disease eradication, we must especially focus on eliminating schistosomiasis and other diseases that seriously endanger people's health, as well as common diseases.

    The entire party and all the people must have great ambition, establish lofty aspirations, publicize widely, create momentum, eliminate the four pests, and vigorously carry out the patriotic health campaign. Great achievements must be made in the three years of 1960, 1961, and 1962. First of all, we must seize the health campaign this year, and immediately take vigorous action now, seize the time, deepen mobilization, work hard, and create greater and more excellent achievements to welcome the convening of the "May 1st" International Labor Day and the Hero Conference on the Cultural and Educational Front, and lay a good foundation for the continued leap forward in health work this year and the next two years.

### 人人动手，大搞爱国卫生运动

    人人动手，大搞爱国卫生运动
    本报今天发表了中央爱国卫生运动委员会、卫生部关于组织春季爱国卫生运动大检查的通知。一个新的爱国卫生运动大高潮就要到来了。卫生工作，是我国全面跃进的一个重要的组成部分。党中央和毛主席从来是十分重视卫生工作的。卫生工作之所以重要，是因为有利于生产，有利于工作，有利于学习，有利于改造我国人民低弱的体质，使得人人身体康强，环境清洁，与生产大跃进，文化与技术大革命密切结合互相促进。正因为这样，卫生工作也就有了移风易俗、改造世界的重大意义。现在，我国工农业生产正在高速度地持续跃进，文化和技术大革命的高潮正在全国形成。卫生工作必须快马加鞭适应这一新的形势。最近，北京、上海、湖南等地已经开展了规模空前壮阔的爱国卫生运动。全国各地应当一无例外地立即动作起来，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大除四害，在全国掀起一个轰轰烈烈的卫生运动新高潮。
    近几年来，特别是自1958年以来，在党中央和毛主席的直接领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的卫生工作配合工农业生产的大跃进和人民公社运动的发展，取得了巨大的成就。各地四害已经大大减少。严重危害人民健康的主要疾病以惊人的速度被消灭或减少。天花、鼠疫、黑热病已经基本消灭。血吸虫病的防治工作取得了巨大的胜利，到去年9月，全国受到治疗的病人有四百九十多万人，占病人总数的70％。疟疾、钩虫病、丝虫病等疾病的流行范围正在急剧缩小。许多城市和农村的环境卫生大大改善，群众讲卫生的习惯初步养成，这些地区人民的精神面貌焕然一新。山西省的稷山县，现在已经基本消灭四害，不仅消灭和控制了严重危害人民的主要疾病和多发病，而且发展到普查普治一般疾病；不仅对人民进行保健工作，而且还开展了对牲畜、家禽的防疫保健工作。他们适应公社生产和生活集体化的特点，在新兴的工厂、牧场、林场、水利工地、公共食堂、托儿所等集体生产和福利事业单位，建立起新的基层卫生医疗保健网。他们还把卫生工作的基本建设同香化、绿化、美化，房屋、街道的整修等建设社会主义新农村的工作结合起来。讲求卫生、破除迷信、相信科学已成为当地新的社会风尚。广东省的佛山市是一个古老的城市，解放前卫生条件极差。解放后特别是大跃进以来，经过大搞群众运动，现在已经根本上改变了城市环境卫生的面貌，成为城市卫生工作的一面红旗。全国各地还有不少具有不同特点的卫生先进地区。这些卫生工作的红旗，是我国卫生运动取得巨大成绩的有力证明。
    但是，我们决不能满足于已有的成绩。我们的卫生运动的根本要求，是要达到消灭疾病、人人振奋、移风易俗、改造国家的目的。我们不但要改造自己的精神面貌，树立共产主义的思想风格，还要改变自己低弱的体质，锻炼成为身体康强的人。显然，我们卫生工作的成就距离这个要求还相当遥远。随着形势的飞跃发展，卫生工作的逐步深入，卫生工作的内容也更加丰富。我们要继续大力进行除害灭病的工作，当前除四害的口号是：“除掉老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子”。一定要在短时间内消灭四害，搞好环境卫生，作到人人养成卫生习惯。同时，还要从积极方面着手，加强群众性的体育活动，要求一切能够参加体育活动的人，都要参加做体操，打球，跑步，爬山，游水，打太极拳及各种各样的体育运动。这是新的形势给卫生工作带来的光荣任务。
    开展声势浩大的爱国卫生运动，关键在于各地党委加强领导，由第一书记挂帅，立即抓紧布置，抓紧总结经验，抓紧检查、竞赛、评比，充分发动群众，配合生产运动，大搞卫生工作。要运用全国卫生工作先进地区的经验，广为宣传。要向广大干部和群众说明，在生产、工作、学习紧张的时候，就越需要有健康的身体。只有把卫生工作安排好了，人们的身体强壮了，才能够进一步促进生产、工作、学习的跃进。稷山县是山西省卫生工作的模范县，也是小麦丰产模范县，去年大旱之后还增产32％。他们搞好了卫生工作，增强了人民的体质，出勤率高了，生产效率高了，也就促进了生产的跃进。把卫生工作看作孤立的一项工作是不对的。卫生工作必须从生产、工作、学习出发，是服务于生产、工作和学习的。生产、工作、学习的跃进，也促进了卫生工作的跃进。以目前的情况为例，全民的技术革命技术革新运动，已使许多工厂、农村的劳动强度大大减轻，改进了劳动条件，这对于促进劳动人民的健康有着直接的影响。又如学习，人们学习得越好，文化科学知识越丰富，也必然越会自觉地注意卫生和健康。这就是生产、工作、学习和卫生工作之间的辩证统一的关系。
    搞好环境卫生和个人卫生，开展体育运动，这也是群众的要求。只有依靠大规模的群众运动，这个重大的任务才能够圆满实现。毛主席在“文化工作中的统一战线”一文中说：“我们必须告诉群众，自己起来同自己的文盲、迷信和不卫生的习惯作斗争。”人民的幸福生活，只有靠人民自己的双手来创造。因此，大搞卫生运动必须大张旗鼓，大做宣传，使得家喻户晓，人人动作起来。事在人为，只要是人民群众有了很大的革命干劲，一切困难就一定会被战胜。一切卫生医药人员都要积极行动起来，在党的领导下和广大群众密切结合，积极主动地站在卫生运动的前面，把卫生知识和技术教给广大人民群众，并担负起卫生工作中的哨兵和技术指导的任务。我们必须充分利用报刊、广播、电影、戏剧、曲艺等形式，结合扫盲、业余教育、学校教育等各项工作，大张旗鼓地开展宣传教育工作。
    应当动员一切人参加到卫生运动新高潮中来，无论老人、小孩，青年、壮年，教员、学生，男子、女子，都要尽可能地手执蝇拍及其他工具，大除四害，大搞卫生，养成卫生习惯，树立“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的社会风尚。
    目前正值春季，蚊蝇即将大量孳生，疾病极易流行。各地各级党委应该抓紧时机，配合生产、工作等各项任务，立即动员全党全民行动起来，首先要向老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子以及其他致病虫害大举进攻。消灭蚊蝇的孳生场所，力争在今年出现更多的大片“四无”地区。为了适应人民生活集体化的新情况，城乡都要十分重视做好集体生产、生活的卫生工作。在工矿、田间、水利交通工地的劳动保护和卫生工作要做好。要使工人、农民吃得好睡得好，劳动时安全，休息时愉快。在生活中特别要注意食堂、幼儿园、托儿所的卫生工作，加强对保育人员、炊事员的卫生教育或训练，要使大家吃得干净卫生，防止各种传染病和食物中毒。改善城乡的环境卫生是除害灭病的很有效的办法。各地应结合养猪积肥、绿化、修路和生产、生活等基本建设，搞好环境卫生。对垃圾污物等要进行无害化处理，特别是对人粪便的妥善处理，是不让蚊蝇孳生的最有效的办法，这对消灭寄生虫病也有重大的意义，一定要把这件事做好。此外，各地还要通过各种各样的方式，大力宣传卫生常识，使居民迅速养成卫生习惯。在灭病工作方面，要特别抓紧消灭血吸虫病等严重危害人民健康的疾病，以及多发病。
    全党全民必须树雄心，立大志，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大除四害，大搞爱国卫生运动。一定要在1960年、1961年、1962年这三年内做出大成绩。首先要抓紧今年的卫生运动，现在就要立即轰轰烈烈地行动起来，抓紧时间，深入动员，大干特干，创造更大、更优越的成绩，迎接“五一”国际劳动节和文教战线群英大会的召开，为今年和今后两年的卫生工作的持续跃进打下良好的基础。
