Our Moscow correspondent, Li Nan, reports: Spring is beginning to dawn on the vast Soviet land. Agricultural laborers throughout the Soviet Union are enthusiastically preparing for spring plowing, striving for an even greater harvest in agricultural production this year.

    **Southern Regions Unveil Spring Plowing and Sowing**

In the southern regions of the Soviet Union, spring plowing has already begun. In the Odessa region of Ukraine, hundreds of tractors have started plowing. In the steppes along the Danube River, four to five thousand hectares of fallow land have already been plowed, ready for sowing. The Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan is now in the midst of a bright spring season. In southern Kyrgyzstan, four states have already begun sowing spring wheat.

    To ensure an even greater harvest this year, agricultural laborers throughout the Soviet Union are implementing the spirit of the December Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, tapping the potential for increasing agricultural and livestock production in all aspects.

    **Adopting Various Measures to Expand Cultivated Land and Sown Areas**

Continuing to expand cultivated land area remains an important task for increasing agricultural products this year. Starting this year, in the Urals, Volga River Basin, Siberia, and the Far East of the Russian Federation, another eight to nine million hectares of new land will continue to be reclaimed, which can increase grain production by 500 to 600 million poods. Republics such as Belarus will continue to drain swampy areas to increase spring sown area. Southern republics such as Moldova and Azerbaijan will focus on developing hilly and sloping areas.

    This year, agricultural farms and fields in various regions are preparing to convert fallow land to crops such as corn and peas. This represents a great potential for increasing agricultural products. The Russian Federation will convert approximately six to seven million hectares of fallow land to the aforementioned crops this year and next year, which can produce more than ten million tons of feed.

    Many regions in the Soviet Union are striving for two harvests a year this year. The sown area of two-season crops in the Kuban region will increase substantially. The lower Volga River states are also preparing to expand the area for two harvests a year. The Russian Federation plans to increase the sown area for two harvests a year to 1.5 million hectares in the coming years.

    **Further Improving Soil by Utilizing More Organic Fertilizer**

In the preparation for spring plowing and sowing this year, various regions are paying special attention to accumulating organic fertilizers such as manure and peat, as a new and enormous potential for increasing agricultural products. Belarus used a total of 38 million tons of manure and peat last year, and the amount of organic fertilizer accumulated this year is even greater. Belarus plans to reach an annual utilization of 80 million tons of local organic fertilizer in the next one to two years, and Kazakhstan has 20 million tons of manure available for utilization each year. The Russian Federation can accumulate a total of 350 to 400 million tons of organic fertilizer, and utilizing these organic fertilizers can increase grain production by 900 million poods each year.

    Soil improvement is also an important task before this year's spring sowing. For example, the Ukrainian Republic is conducting a comprehensive study of soil. Scientific research institutions are working with agricultural farms and fields to compile soil maps and formulate recommendations for better land utilization. Belarus is also comprehensively conducting soil surveys. This work will be completed in two to three years.

    Various regions are also preparing to further promote new sowing methods in this year's spring sowing. For example, Ukraine will adopt square cluster planting and square planting methods for all sugar beet sowing this year to save labor.

    **Establishing Feed Bases and Vigorously Developing Animal Husbandry**

Animal husbandry is also vigorously tapping the potential for increased production. The most important task is to establish feed bases centered on expanding corn production. Kazakhstan will plant a large amount of corn this year, and the sown area will increase at a high speed each year. By 1962, the corn sown area in Kazakhstan will increase by 2.2 times compared to 1959. The corn sown area in Ukraine will increase to half of the total grain sown area in the coming years.

    In increasing meat production, pig farming is the most important task. Various regions are preparing to vigorously develop pig farming this year. Taking Ukraine as an example, agricultural farms and fields raised a total of seven million pigs last year, and commercial trading organizations raised a total of one million pigs, an increase of 24% compared to 1958. This year, agricultural farms and fields in the Ukrainian Republic plan to raise 13 million pigs, and commercial organizations plan to raise 1.5 million pigs.

    Utilizing waste from the food industry is a great potential for increasing meat production. Ukraine has established many inter-farm breeding stations utilizing waste from various sugar factories and alcohol factories. This year, these breeding stations will use the residue and dregs from these food factories to raise 300,000 cattle. Oil factories and cheese factories will also establish breeding stations. Utilizing the waste from these factories can raise one million pigs.

    Various regions will also vigorously develop poultry as another major potential for rapidly developing meat production.

    In tapping the potential of animal husbandry, various regions are also paying special attention to implementing artificial insemination and improving feeding methods. Azerbaijan plans to implement artificial insemination for 100,000 dairy cows and water buffaloes and one million sheep this year to increase production.

    Before the start of spring sowing, the competition to tap potential and complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule in the Soviet countryside has been vigorously launched. Various states and republics have proposed this year's competition plans. Various initiatives are constantly being put forward. The working people are bidding farewell to winter and welcoming the upcoming spring sowing, striving to surpass last year this year.

    挖掘增产潜力  争取更大丰收
    苏联农业战线高奏迎春曲
    本报莫斯科12日电　记者李楠报道：在辽阔的苏联大地上，春天开始降临。苏联各地农业劳动者正在热烈地进行春耕的准备工作，争取今年农业生产获得更大的丰收。
    南部地区揭开春耕春播序幕
    在苏联南部地区，春耕工作已经开始。在乌克兰的敖德萨州，有数百架拖拉机已经开始了翻地工作。多瑙河沿岸的草原里，有四、五千公顷休闲地已经翻耕完毕，准备播种。乌兹别克的富尔干平原，现在正是春光明媚的季节，在吉尔吉斯南部，有四个州已经开始了春小麦播种工作。
    为了保证今年更大的丰收，苏联各地农业劳动者正在贯彻苏共中央十二月全会的精神，从各方面挖掘增加农业畜业生产的潜力。
    采取各种措施扩大耕地和播种面积
    继续扩大耕地面积仍然是今年增加农产品的一个重要任务。从今年起，在俄罗斯联邦的乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域、西伯利亚和远东将继续开垦八百万到九百万公顷的新地，可增加粮食五亿到六亿普特。白俄罗斯等共和国将继续排干池沼地带，以增加春播面积。南方摩达维亚和阿塞拜疆等共和国将着重开发丘陵地区和山坡地。
    今年各地农庄农场都准备将休闲地改种玉米、豌豆等作物。这是增加农产品的一个很大的潜力。俄罗斯联邦今年和明年将把约六百到七百万公顷的休闲地改种上述作物，可多产饲料一千多万吨。
    今年苏联许多地区要为一年收两季而奋斗。库班地区的两季作物播种面积将大量增多。伏尔加河下游各州也正在准备扩大一年两收的面积。俄罗斯联邦准备在最近几年内将一年两收的播种面积增加到一百五十万公顷。
    更多地利用有机肥料进一步改良土壤
    在今年春耕播种的准备工作中，各地特别注意积粪肥、泥炭等有机肥料，作为增加农产品的新的巨大的潜力。白俄罗斯去年共使用了三千八百万吨粪肥和泥炭，今年有机肥料的积存数量更大为增加。白俄罗斯准备今后一两年内达到每年利用地方性有机肥料八千万吨，哈萨克斯坦可供利用的粪肥每年可达二千万吨。俄罗斯联邦能够积存的有机肥料共有三亿五千万到四亿吨，利用这些有机肥料每年可增产九亿普特谷物。
    改良土壤的工作也是今年春播前的一项重要工作。例如乌克兰共和国正在进行全面研究土壤的工作。科学研究机关正在和农庄农场一道编制土壤图，制订更好地利用土地的建议。白俄罗斯也在全面进行土壤调查工作。这一工作将在两、三年内完成。
    各地还准备在今年春播中进一步推广新播种方法，例如乌克兰今年甜菜播种将全部采用方形簇种和方形播种法，以节约劳动力。
    建立饲料基地大力发展畜牧业
    畜牧业也在大力发掘增产潜力。其中最重要的一项就是建立以扩大玉米为主的饲料基地。哈萨克斯坦今年要大种玉米，播种面积每年都要高速度增加。至1962年哈萨克玉米播种面积将比1959年提高二点二倍。乌克兰玉米播种面积将在最近几年内提高到占整个谷物播种面积的一半。
    在增加肉类生产中，养猪是最重要的一项。今年各地都在准备大力发展养猪事业。以乌克兰为例，去年各农庄和农场共养猪七百万头，商业贸易机关共养猪一百万头，比1958年增加了24％。今年乌克兰共和国农庄、农场准备养猪到一千三百万头，商业机构准备养一百五十万头。
    利用食品工业的废物是增加肉类生产的一大潜力。乌克兰利用各制糖工厂和酒精工厂的废物成立了许多庄际饲养站。今年将利用这些食品工厂的残渣和糟粕饲养三十万头牛。油脂工厂和奶酪工厂也将成立饲养站，利用这些工厂的废料可以饲养一百万条猪。
    各地还要大力发展家禽，作为迅速发展肉类生产的另一重大潜力。
    在发掘畜牧业的潜力方面，各地还正在特别注意实行人工授精，改进饲养方法。阿塞拜疆今年准备将十万条奶牛和水牛及一百万只羊实行人工授精以增加产量。
    在春播开始前，苏联农村中的挖掘潜力提前完成七年计划的竞赛已蓬蓬勃勃地开展了起来。各个州和各共和国都已提出今年的竞赛计划。各种倡议不断提出。劳动人民正在送别冬季，迎接即将到来的春播，争取今年胜过去年。
