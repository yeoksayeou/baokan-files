Adjusting Employee Dormitories by Production Unit

Since the Great Leap Forward, industry has developed greatly, and the number of employees has increased significantly. This is a great thing, but there is an important issue within this great thing that deserves attention. That is, because employees come from all directions and enter the factory at different times, and new houses are built gradually, many places have not been uniformly arranged with the basic production unit as the center. Workers and cadres from the same production unit are scattered in various dormitories, some near and some far, and employees from different factories, mines, different types of work, and different shifts live together. This situation is detrimental to the employees' production, rest, and spare-time learning. Therefore, adjusting employee dormitories is a very important matter. Each factory and enterprise can make appropriate adjustments based on local conditions and conditions, with the principle of benefiting production and facilitating life.

How to adjust employee dormitories? In the past, this newspaper introduced the methods of the Yangquan Coal Mine area in Shanxi Province, and today it publishes the methods of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The method of Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel Company) is to adjust employee dormitories according to production units. They take the factory as a unit, separating employees of different workshops, sections, and shifts, and live according to the system. This is indeed a good method. The employees in a dormitory have consistent work and rest times, and the employees have a quiet rest environment, can get adequate rest, and are naturally full of energy during production. Before the adjustment of employee dormitories in Anshan Iron and Steel Company, workers reflected that "it is always noisy, and it is not as good to get off work as it is to be on duty." After adjusting the dormitory according to the production unit, the workers said, "I sleep soundly after work, and I am full of energy at work." This is a very good illustration. Adjusting employee dormitories according to production units allows workers in the same workshop and unit to change the past situation of "being together at work but not seeing each other after work." Living together after work, caring for each other, taking care of each other, enhances the unity of employees, and is conducive to common progress. Cadres and the masses live together, which can also detect problems in time, carry out political and ideological education, and strengthen management work. Employees of the same type of work and the same shift live together, and spare-time schools are set up nearby, which is also convenient for better organizing spare-time technical and cultural learning. In short, adjusting employee dormitories according to production units has great benefits for arranging employees' production, life, and learning.

Although there are many benefits to adjusting employee dormitories according to production units, some cadres, especially some administrative and welfare cadres, have not fully recognized this issue. Some people think that it is difficult to change the habit of living in a place for a long time, and they have fear of difficulties. Some people always want their unit's employees to live better and wider, and are unwilling to take out the extra houses for exchange. Therefore, we must first solve some ideological problems. It should be seen that the rational adjustment of employee dormitories is a concrete manifestation of the Party's concern for the lives of employees. Only our socialist country can fully care for the lives of employees and try every means to rationally arrange the lives of employees. We must not only make employees have houses to live in, but also consider how to make them live better and arrange their lives better under possible conditions, so as to better arrange their production and learning. This is an administrative work, and it is also a very important political work. The Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Party Committees of its subordinate factories and mines regard the adjustment of employee dormitories and the organization of relocation as a major event, fully discuss and unify ideological understanding, so that the vast number of cadres actively take action, are not afraid of many things, are not afraid of complicated clues, go deep into the masses, and solve problems in a timely manner, so that the dormitory adjustment work is carried out smoothly.

Adjusting employee dormitories is in line with the interests of the vast number of employees. However, it must also be seen that this matter directly affects the personal lives of each employee. A person spends almost most of their time in the dormitory besides the eight hours of work. Therefore, they are very concerned about the arrangement of the dormitory. It is also very natural for some people to have some opinions or opinions on moving. We should proceed from specific issues, conduct realistic analysis, and use it to conduct comprehensive education to further improve the awareness of the masses of employees. In this way, those thoughts that simply start from the individual, such as picking fat and picking thin, liking the new and disliking the old, and greedy for the big and losing the small, will naturally be persuaded. Many employees have lived in the old society and have been persecuted by the old society. At that time, they lived in open-air shacks, and today they live in tall buildings. The contrast between the past and the present will surely receive profound self-education. In the adjustment, it is also possible that the dormitory conditions of individual employees are not as good as the original ones. Even so, from a global perspective, after adjusting the dormitory, it will undoubtedly be more convenient for the employees' production, learning, and life. More than 2,000 employees of the Nanjing Chemical Plant, after political and ideological education, adjusted their dormitories according to workshops and groups, and then launched a mass "civilized dormitory" movement. The sanitary appearance was completely new, the unity of the workers was greatly strengthened, and a happy atmosphere was everywhere. Therefore, as long as the truth of adjusting the dormitory is explained to the masses of employees, they will naturally sincerely support it.

The adjustment of employee dormitories must properly take care of and consider various aspects. Where adjustments are needed, the time and steps of the adjustment should be determined according to the specific circumstances, and thorough preparations should be made in advance. Party members, League members, activists, and advanced producers should play a leading role in adjusting dormitories, and should endure hardships first and enjoy afterwards, and give full play to the spirit of class friendship. After the dormitory is adjusted, a new life in the dormitory should be organized immediately, so that employees can live, study, and rest quietly in their spare time, and be full of energy during working hours.

In addition to factories and mines, adjusting employee dormitories according to production units, the real estate systems of large and medium-sized cities can also gradually and systematically organize the exchange of employee housing throughout the city according to the principles of obeying production, exchanging houses, moving from far to near, and facilitating life. Many employees have their own houses, but they are far away from their work units, which affects production and life. This requires the urban real estate department to organize the exchange of houses. Last year, Wuhan City adopted a method combining self-finding objects and organized introductions, and has successively organized more than 1,200 households to exchange housing, and both parties are satisfied. All localities can adapt to local conditions and appropriately organize and plan the work of exchanging houses.

The housing problem is a social problem and a historical problem. Since society has been divided into class society, due to the concentration of wealth in the hands of the exploiting class, the working people have had very few houses or even no houses to live in, and the living conditions have been extremely poor. Today, in our socialist country, the housing problem of employees has been gradually resolved reasonably with the development of production. This is an unprecedented good thing. In order to better organize the lives of employees under the existing dormitory conditions and benefit production, it is of course a good thing to adjust employee dormitories according to production units. Doing a good job in this work will greatly benefit improving the political awareness of employees, promoting the new atmosphere of collectivism, enriching the spiritual life of employees, improving living conditions, and thus promoting production. We believe that the Party committees of cities and industrial and mining areas in various places will be able to take up this work, strengthen leadership, and gradually adjust the dormitories reasonably according to the specific conditions of each place, further encourage the production enthusiasm of employees, and promote the continued leap forward on the industrial front.

### 按生产单位调整职工宿舍

    按生产单位调整职工宿舍
    大跃进以来，工业大发展，职工人数大量增加，职工宿舍也增加了很多。这是一件大好事，但是，这件大好事中存在一个值得重视的问题。那就是，由于职工来自四面八方，进厂时间先后不一，而新建房屋又是逐步修建起来的，不少地方没有按照基层生产单位为中心加以统一安排，同一个生产单位的工人和干部，散居各个宿舍，远近不一，不同厂矿、不同工种、不同班次的职工杂居在一起。这种情况，对职工的生产、休息和业余学习，都是不利的。因此，调整职工宿舍，是一件很重要的事。各个工厂、企业，可以根据当地情况和条件，以有利生产，便利生活为原则，作出恰当的调整。
    怎样来调整职工宿舍呢？过去，本报曾经介绍过山西省阳泉煤矿区的办法，今天又刊载鞍山钢铁公司的办法。鞍钢的办法是按生产单位调整职工宿舍。他们以厂为单位，分别不同车间、工段、班次的职工，按系统居住。这的确是个好办法。一个宿舍的职工作息时间一致，职工有了安静的休息环境，能得到充分的休息，生产时自然是精神饱满。鞍山钢铁公司职工宿舍没有调整以前，工人反映，“总是乱嚷嚷，下班不如在班”。按生产单位调整宿舍后，工人说，“下班觉睡透，上班干劲足”。这就是很好的说明。按生产单位调整职工宿舍，使同一车间，同一单位的工人改变了过去“上班在一起，下班不照面”的情况。下班以后住在一起，互相关怀、互相照应，增强了职工的团结，有利于共同进步。干部和群众生活在一起，又可以及时发现问题，进行政治思想教育，加强管理工作。同工种、同班次的职工住在一起，业余学校设在附近，也就便于更好地组织业余技术学习和文化学习。总之，按生产单位调整职工宿舍，对于安排职工生产、生活、学习都有很大好处。
    按生产单位来调整职工宿舍虽然好处很多，但是，有些干部，特别是某些行政福利干部，还没有全面地认识这个问题。有人认为地方住久了，习惯不好改，有畏难情绪。也有的人总想让本单位的职工住得好些，住得宽些，不愿把多余的房子拿出来交换。因此，必须首先解决一些思想问题。应该看到，合理调整职工宿舍，是党对职工生活关心的具体表现。只有我们社会主义国家才能全面地关心职工的生活，想尽一切办法去合理安排职工生活。我们不仅要使职工有房子住，还要考虑到如何在可能条件下，使他们住得更好些，生活安排得更好些，从而也把他们的生产、学习安排得更好些。这是一件行政性的工作，同时也是一件十分重要的政治工作。鞍山钢铁公司党委和所属各厂、矿党委，都把调整职工宿舍、组织搬家当作一件大事，充分讨论，统一思想认识，使广大干部积极行动起来，不怕事情多，不怕头绪繁，深入群众，及时解决问题，使得宿舍调整工作进行得很顺利。
    调整职工宿舍，是符合广大职工的利益的。但是，也必须看到，这件事情直接影响到每个职工的切身生活。一个人除了八小时工作外，几乎大部分时间是在宿舍里度过的。因此他们对于宿舍的安排是很关心的。有一部分人，对搬家有自己的一些看法或意见，也是很自然的事情。我们应该从具体问题出发，进行实事求是的分析，据以进行全面的教育，进一步提高职工群众的觉悟。这样，那些单纯从个人出发的挑肥拣瘦、喜新厌旧、贪大丢小的思想，自然会被说服。很多职工都在旧社会里生活过，受过旧社会的迫害。那时住的是露天席棚，今天住的是大楼高铺，前后对比，一定会受到深刻的自我教育。在调整当中，也可能有个别职工的宿舍条件不如原住的好。即使如此，从全局来看，调整宿舍后，对职工的生产、学习、生活无疑会有更多的方便。南京化工厂两千多名职工，经过政治思想教育，按车间、小组调整了宿舍，接着开展了群众性的“文明宿舍”运动，卫生面貌焕然一新，工人团结大大加强，到处洋溢欢乐的气氛。因此只要向职工群众讲清楚调整宿舍的道理，他们自然会衷心拥护的。
    职工宿舍的调整一定要妥善地照顾和考虑多方面的问题。凡需要调整的地方，应当根据具体情况确定调整的时间和步骤，并且在事前周密做好准备工作。党员、团员、积极分子、先进生产者在调整宿舍中要起带头作用，应当吃苦在先，享受在后，充分发挥阶级友爱的精神。在宿舍调整以后，要立即组织宿舍的新生活，让职工在业余时间愉快地生活、学习和安静地休息，在工作时间精神饱满。
    除了厂矿、企业，按照生产单位调整职工宿舍以外，各大、中城市房地产系统，也可以根据服从生产，房屋互换，由远到近，便利生活的原则，逐步地有计划地组织全市职工住房互换。很多职工自己有住房，但是离工作单位较远，影响生产和生活。这就需要城市房产部门来组织房屋互换工作。武汉市去年采取了自找对象和组织介绍相结合的方法，已经陆续组织了一千二百多户互换了住房，双方满意。各地可以因时因地制宜，适当地有组织有计划地来进行换屋的工作。
    住宅问题，是一个社会问题，也是一个历史问题。自从社会分化为阶级社会以来，由于财富集中到剥削阶级手里，劳动人民只有很少房屋甚至没有房屋住，居住的条件是极其恶劣的。今天，在我们社会主义国家里，职工住房问题随着生产的发展而逐步得到合理的解决。这是史无前例的好事。为了在已有的宿舍的条件下，更好地组织职工的生活，并有利于生产，按生产单位来调整职工宿舍，当然是一件好上加好的事情。作好这一工作，对于提高职工政治觉悟，发扬集体主义的新风气，丰富职工精神生活，改善生活条件，从而促进生产，都有极大的好处。我们相信，各地城市和工矿区党委一定能够把这一工作抓起来，加强领导，根据各地的具体条件，逐步地把宿舍合理调整好，更大地鼓舞职工的生产热情，推动工业战线上的继续跃进。
