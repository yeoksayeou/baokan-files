A Dangerous Signal
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Recently, the West German militarists' plots for foreign expansion have become increasingly rampant. In order to allow the West German Bundeswehr to conduct training for atomic warfare, the West German Adenauer government has negotiated with the Franco government to establish West German military bases in Spain. That's not all; West German Defense Minister Strauss is still clamoring that West Germany needs more training locations and military supply bases. Recently, the West German government has made requests to Portugal, Turkey, France, and Italy to establish military supply bases.

Today, one of the West German militarists' claws is extended toward its Western "allies," while the other is always ready to pounce on the East. Recently, the West German army has conducted several large-scale atomic warfare exercises. The so-called "Winter Shield" atomic blitz exercise that began in Upper Palatinate was aimed at the German Democratic Republic as the target of attack. According to West German Defense Minister Strauss, in March, a nuclear missile launch exercise targeting the German Democratic Republic will also be held in the Baltic Sea. Echoing this, West German Chancellor Adenauer has been constantly clamoring for the "liberation of eastern territories." Obviously, in the West German militarists' conspiracy plans, on the one hand, they use the establishment of foreign military bases to encroach upon other countries' territories, and on the other hand, they use blitzkrieg attacks to annex the German Democratic Republic.

All this shows that the ambitious West German militarists have brazenly embarked on the path of revanchism.

History has proven that when German imperialism restores its political, economic, and military strength and regains its aggressive potential, it will actively expand outward and provoke new wars. In 1914 and 1939, Germany launched two world wars to争夺势力范围, which were actions of German imperialism relying on its strong economic and military strength to demand a "re-division of the world by force" and "the forcible seizure of living space." It has only been fifteen years since the end of World War II, but the imperialist forces in West Germany have made a comeback. Economically, West Germany has once again become a huge competitive force in the capitalist world and is beginning to embark on the path of large-scale military economization; militarily, West Germany has built the largest modern army on the West European continent and is desperately stepping up its nuclear armament. Recently, Adenauer and his ilk have brazenly clamored: "Germany must be strong enough to recover its lost territories." It is clear that West Germany's current military expansion is not accidental; it indicates that the German imperialist forces are eager to retrace the old path of German militarism. West Germany's excuse for requesting the establishment of military bases in Spain is very meaningful. It emphasizes that West Germany's territory is limited, so its army needs a larger range of development. This is Hitler's "living space" theory. And West Germany's blatant collusion with Franco's Spain, a former accomplice of Hitler, cannot but remind people of the former Berlin-Madrid Axis. There is every reason to regard the current outward expansion steps of the West German militarists as a dangerous signal.

The reason why West German militarists are so rampant in seizing footholds abroad is the result of the Western countries, especially the US imperialists, pursuing a policy of rearming West Germany. Since the war, the United States has actively revived West German militarism, helped West Germany build a new Bundeswehr, and brought West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, attempting to use West Germany as a shock force for a future anti-Soviet war. The Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, US General Norstad, once openly said that because the West German army makes "extensive contributions" to Western "defense," it is "completely unimaginable to put West Germany in a secondary position." Recently, the United States has particularly intensified West Germany's nuclear armament and has encouraged and supported the expansionist ambitions of West German militarism. These actions by the United States are undoubtedly a great encouragement to the West German militarist forces. West Germany's plan to establish military bases in Spain is only one step in the US plan to revive West German militarist forces. Many Western countries and West German newspapers have frankly stated that West Germany's request to establish military bases in Spain is a long-planned conspiracy with the consent and support of the United States. The West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," which often reflects the opinions of the Bonn government, said in an editorial: Bonn's actions have been approved by the United States. It wrote: "US Secretary of State Herter not only learned of West Germany's plan to establish 'military supply depots' in Spain, but also agreed to this plan in his talks with West German Foreign Minister Brentano." The newspaper also said that General Norstad, Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the late former US Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles, and the current Secretary of Defense Gates had all talked about this matter long ago. And the implementation of such a plan at a time when the East-West summit is about to be held obviously has other purposes. Just as the Associated Press reported the British view, it is to "agitate and poison the international atmosphere" before the East-West summit.

After the West German government's expansionist conspiracy was exposed, it aroused strong condemnation from world public opinion. But now Western countries are trying their best to excuse the West German militarists. The authorities of the United States, Britain, and France have repeatedly said that it is absolutely necessary for West Germany to find its bases outside of Germany based on military needs. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd has stated twice in the House of Commons that West Germany can seek bases within the North Atlantic Group countries. And France, which has been ravaged by German militarism twice, its government actually declared that it has made arrangements for the West German army to use facilities in France. This shows that the ruling classes of Britain and France are once again making dangerous gambles with the interests of the nation and the security of the country. But the people of Western European countries and the people of the world are not so forgetful about the aggressive crimes of German militarism. They will never allow history to repeat itself. The French "Liberation" pointed out: The significance of the West German army stationed in Spanish territory bordering France is very obvious; this is a well-known restart of encirclement. The West German militarists have sent a dangerous signal. Can the peace-loving people of the world remain indifferent to this dangerous signal? Absolutely not!

    一个危险的信号
    本报评论员
    最近西德军国主义分子的对外扩张阴谋越来越嚣张了。西德阿登纳政府为了让西德国防军进行准备原子战争的训练，已经同佛朗哥政府谈判，要求在西班牙建立西德军事基地。这还不算，西德国防部长施特劳斯还在叫嚣：西德需要更多的训练地点和军事供应基地。最近西德政府已向葡萄牙、土耳其、法国和意大利提出了建立军事供应基地的要求。
    今天西德军国主义者的一只魔爪伸向西方的“盟国”，而另一只又时时准备扑向东方。最近以来，西德军队进行了多次的大规模原子战争演习。在上法尔茨开始的一次所谓“冬季盾牌”原子闪电战演习，就是以德意志民主共和国作为进攻对象的。据西德国防部长施特劳斯宣布，3月份还要在波罗的海举行针对德意志民主共和国的原子火箭的发射演习。与此相呼应的，西德总理阿登纳又在不断叫嚣“解放东部领土”。显然在西德军国主义分子的阴谋计划中一方面以建立国外军事基地来蚕食别国领土，同时也以闪电袭击来吞并德意志民主共和国。
    这一切说明野心勃勃的西德军国主义分子已经明目张胆地踏上了复仇主义的道路。
    历史已经证明，当德国帝国主义在恢复了它的政治、经济和军事实力，重新具有了侵略潜力的时候，它就要积极向外扩张，挑起新的战争。1914年和1939年德国为了争夺势力范围而发动了两次世界大战，就是德国帝国主义凭借自己强大的经济和军事实力，要求“武力重新分割世界”和“武力夺取生存空间”的行动。现在距离第二次大战结束才不过十五年，但是西德的帝国主义势力又东山再起了。在经济上，西德又成为资本主义世界中一个巨大的竞争力量，并且正在开始走上大规模军事经济化的道路；在军事上，西德已建立起西欧大陆上最大的一支现代化的军队，而且正在拼命加紧原子武装。而近来阿登纳之流已毫无顾忌地叫嚷：“德国必须强大到能够恢复失地的程度”。由此可见，西德目前的军事扩张不是偶然的，它表明德国帝国主义势力已急不及待地要重走德国军国主义的老路。西德要求在西班牙设立军事基地的借口，就是意味深长的。它强调西德的地域有限，因而它的军队需要更大的发展范围。这就是希特勒的“生存空间”理论。而西德今天悍然同以前希特勒的帮凶佛朗哥西班牙勾结，也不能不使人想起过去的柏林—马德里轴心。把西德军国主义分子目前的向外扩张步骤看作是一个危险的信号，是完全有理由的。
    西德军国主义者所以这样猖狂地在国外攫取立足点，是西方国家特别是美帝国主义执行重新武装西德政策的结果。战后以来，美国积极复活西德的军国主义，帮助西德建立新国防军，把西德拉入北大西洋侵略集团，企图利用西德作为未来反苏战争的突击力量。北大西洋公约组织最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德曾经公开说：由于西德军队对于西方“防御有广泛的贡献”，因此要把西德“压在次要的地位，那是完全不可想像的。”最近以来美国特别加紧西德的原子武装，并怂恿和支持西德军国主义的扩张野心。美国的这些做法，对于西德军国主义势力无疑是很大的鼓励。西德要在西班牙建立军事基地，不过是美国复活西德军国主义势力计划中的一个步骤而已。许多西方国家和西德的报纸消息都毫不讳言，西德要求在西班牙建立军事基地是在美国同意和支持下的一项蓄谋已久的阴谋计划。经常反映波恩政府意见的西德“法兰克福汇报”在一篇社论中说：波恩的行动是得到美国同意的。它写道：“美国国务卿赫脱不仅得知了西德在西班牙建立‘军需仓库’的计划，而且在他同西德外长勃伦塔诺的会谈中同意了这个计划。”这家报纸还说，北大西洋公约组织总司令诺斯塔德将军、已故的美国前国防部副部长卡利斯和现任国防部长盖茨也都早就谈过这件事件。而这样一个计划选择在快要举行东西方最高级会议的时候付诸实施，显然是还有其另外的目的。正像美联社报道英国人的看法说，它是要在东西方最高级会议之前“动荡和毒化国际气氛”。
    西德政府的这种扩张阴谋被揭露之后，已引起了世界舆论的强烈谴责。但是现在西方国家却竭力为西德军国主义分子开脱。美国、英国和法国的当权人物一再说什么：根据军事上的需要，西德在德国以外的地方寻找它的基地是完全必要的。英国外交大臣劳埃德在下院的两次谈话中都表示西德可以在北大西洋集团国家内寻求基地。而曾经两次受德国军国主义蹂躏的法国，它的政府竟声言已作出安排让西德军队使用在法国的设施。这说明英法等国的统治阶级又一次把民族的利益和国家的安全去进行危险的赌博。但是西欧各国人民和全世界人民对于德国军国主义的侵略罪行却并不如此健忘。他们决不允许历史重演。法国“解放报”就指出：西德军队驻扎在与法国接壤的西班牙领土上的意义是很明显的，这是我们所熟知的一种包围的重新开始。西德军国主义者已经发出了危险的信号，全世界爱好和平的人民能够对这一个危险信号无动于衷吗？决不能！
