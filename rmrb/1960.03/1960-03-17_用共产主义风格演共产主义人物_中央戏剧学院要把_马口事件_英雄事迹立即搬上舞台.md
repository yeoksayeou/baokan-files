    Performing Communist Figures with Communist Style
    Central Academy of Drama to Immediately Bring the Heroic Deeds of the "Ma Kou Incident" to the Stage
    (Our dispatch) On the morning of March 15th, teachers and students of the Central Academy of Drama were very excited after seeing the report "Salute to People with Noble Communist Style" published in the People's Daily. The Academy's Party Committee immediately convened responsible comrades from various departments for research and decided that the directing and performance department teaching and research group would be responsible for organizing teachers and students to collectively create and bring this heroic event to the stage. Teachers and students of various departments responded to the call of the Academy's Party Committee with soaring enthusiasm. Inspired by the spirit of Communism and encouraged by the heroic deeds, they are determined to perform this play with the highest speed and best quality, rehearse around the 20th of this month, and reach the level of performance.
    In addition, in order to meet the needs of the audience and enable more people to see the performance of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," in addition to continuous performances by the Experimental Drama Theater, teachers and students of the Performance Department and the Stage Art Department, combined with teaching, are also rushing to arrange and design the play with high political enthusiasm. It is planned to complete it in three days and meet the audience around the 20th of this month, and deliver it to the vast suburban audience. (Zhao Chuang)
