Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 22nd - According to TASS: The routine meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee between the East and West was held on the 21st at the Palais des Nations under the chairmanship of the French representative. After the meeting, Roschin, the spokesman of the Soviet delegation, held a press conference and analyzed the disarmament proposals of both the East and West.

	Roschin said that Zorin, the head of the Soviet delegation, emphasized at the meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee on the 21st that it is now time to begin studying specific issues of comprehensive and complete disarmament. Zorin also made supplementary explanations on some specific measures of the Soviet Union's comprehensive and complete disarmament plan.

	The Soviet delegation spokesman emphasized that the Soviet government had considered the West's views on the disarmament issue when formulating the comprehensive and complete disarmament plan.

	He said that the Soviet plan proposes that in the first two stages of comprehensive and complete disarmament, measures should first be taken to greatly reduce armed forces and armaments, as well as to completely disband armies and abolish conventional armaments. Then, in the next stage, measures should be taken to completely ban nuclear weapons.

	Roschin pointed out that the measures in the Soviet disarmament plan related to the significant reduction of armed forces and armaments, up to the complete elimination of armed forces and armaments, have the following advantages: on the one hand, these measures are relatively easy to implement from an organizational and technical perspective (including the establishment of supervision); on the other hand, they are a very important contribution to solving the task of comprehensive and complete disarmament. Roschin also pointed out that Zorin, the head of the Soviet delegation, said in his speech at the meeting that the Soviet government has always firmly advocated the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons at any stage of disarmament.

	Commenting on the disarmament measures proposed by Western countries, the Soviet delegation spokesman pointed out that, in fact, Western countries are proposing to maintain the existing level of armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union; however, they do not make any provisions at all for the level of armed forces of other major powers. This means that other major powers will also maintain their armed forces at their current levels, or even expand their armies. Roschin also pointed out that, at the same time, people do not know how many years Western countries intend to use to implement measures to reduce their armed forces, whether it is three years, five years, ten years, or even longer.

	Roschin continued that the next step in the Western plan is not to suggest physically destroying conventional armaments, but only storing them, and storing them in the territories of the countries that possess these armaments. In addition, the Western plan also mentions that the armaments of each country should be consistent with the level and number of armed forces. Roschin pointed out that if the armed forces remain at the previous level, then in practice, there is no reduction of conventional armaments at all, because all countries believe that the amount of armaments stored in their arsenals is consistent with the existing level of their armed forces.

	The Soviet delegation spokesman also specifically pointed out that the level of armed forces stipulated by Western countries for the Soviet Union and the United States is even higher than the level they proposed last year in their partial disarmament measures plan.

	The Soviet delegation spokesman finally emphasized that the entire Western disarmament plan does not put forward any deadlines for implementation at all.

### 苏联代表团发言人在记者招待会上指出  西方方案根本谈不到军备的任何裁减

    苏联代表团发言人在记者招待会上指出
    西方方案根本谈不到军备的任何裁减
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：东西方十国裁军委员会例行会议21日在法国代表主持下在国联大厦举行，会后，苏联代表团发言人罗申举行了记者招待会，对东西方的裁军方案进行了分析。
    罗申说，苏联代表团团长佐林在十国裁军委员会21日会议上强调指出，现在已经是着手研究全面彻底裁军具体问题的时候了。佐林还对苏联的全面彻底裁军方案的某些具体措施作了补充解释。
    苏联代表团发言人强调指出，苏联政府在制定全面彻底裁军方案时，已考虑了西方对裁军问题的看法。
    他说，苏联的方案提议在全面彻底裁军的头两个阶段首先采取有关大大裁减武装部队和军备以及有关全部解散军队和取消常规军备的措施，然后，在下一阶段实现彻底禁止核武器的措施。
    罗申指出，苏联裁军方案中有关大大裁减武装部队和军备、直到彻底取消武装部队和军备的措施具有下列优点：一方面，从组织技术方面（包括建立监督）来说，这些措施比较容易实现；另一方面，它们是对解决全面彻底裁军任务的十分重要的贡献。罗申还指出，苏联代表团团长佐林在会议发言中说，苏联政府过去和现在一直坚决主张在裁军的任何一个阶段彻底禁止核武器。
    苏联代表团发言人在评论西方国家提出的裁军措施时指出，事实上，西方国家是建议保持美国和苏联武装部队现有水平；而对其他大国武装部队的水平则根本不作任何规定，这就是说，其他大国也将把自己的武装部队保持在现有水平上，甚至可以扩充军队。罗申还指出，同时，人们也不知道西方国家打算用多少年来实现裁减自己武装部队的措施，是三年呢，是五年呢，是十年还是更久。
    罗申接着说，西方计划中的下一步不是建议从物质上销毁常规军备而只是把它们储存起来，并且是储存在拥有这些军备的国家的领土上。此外西方计划还提到各国的军备应该符合武装部队的水平和人数。罗申指出，如果武装部队仍然保持以前的水平，那么实际上就根本谈不到常规军备的任何裁减，因为各国都认为，它们军火库中储存的军备的数量是符合它们武装部队的现有水平的。
    苏联代表团发言人还特别指出，西方国家为苏联和美国规定的武装部队水平甚至比它们去年在局部裁军措施方案中提出的水平还高。
    苏联代表团发言人最后强调指出，整个西方裁军方案根本没有提出任何执行的期限。
