Nanchang, March 20th (This newspaper's dispatch) – Following the surge of the "Three Catch-Up" movement (poor teams catching up with rich teams, mountainous areas catching up with plains areas, and low-yield areas catching up with high-yield areas) in various parts of Jiangxi, a new upsurge of the "Three Helps" movement (rich teams helping poor teams, plains areas helping mountainous areas, and high-yield areas helping low-yield areas) has taken shape in many regions. This is an important characteristic of agricultural production in Jiangxi this year.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, and in the great practice of the People's Communes and the Great Leap Forward, the communist ideology and style of the broad masses of commune members in Jiangxi are growing rapidly. People-to-people, team-to-team, and commune-to-commune relations have been linked together by new ideas for common development, common prosperity, and the common construction of socialist undertakings. Therefore, when the broad masses of commune members in poor teams, mountainous areas, and low-yield areas launched the "Three Catch-Up" movement this year with soaring enthusiasm, the communes and teams in rich teams, plains areas, and high-yield areas immediately extended a friendly helping hand, targeting the difficulties of the poor teams, mountainous areas, and low-yield areas, such as poor natural conditions, large fields but few people, and a lack of labor. They launched the "Three Helps" movement, doing everything possible to help them catch up with and surpass themselves. Two hundred and five rich teams in sixteen communes in Gao'an County have paired up with sixty-nine poor teams and signed cooperation contracts. The scope of cooperation includes not only manpower and materials, but also the establishment of a regular meeting system for exchanging production experiences. The slogan of one hundred and sixty-one rich teams in Wuning County to support poor teams is: "Support whatever is lacking, help with whatever is needed, and help whenever it is needed." Four rich teams in Ruoxi Commune, namely Dongshan, Xingyuan, Qiaoyuan, and Aiguo, learned that the poor team, Quanxi Brigade, was building a reservoir to irrigate a thousand mu of fields, but was facing difficulties due to the large scale of the project and the small workforce, making it difficult to complete before the flood season. They immediately dispatched more than 1,600 strong commune members, carrying red flags, tools, and grain, to the construction site to provide support. After ten days of hard work together, they completed the project ahead of schedule.

Plain areas helping mountainous areas has further broken through team and commune boundaries. Taojiang, Xiaohe, Datang, Zhengping and other communes in the plain areas of Xinfeng County have all established long-term labor exchange cooperation contracts with Youshan, Jinpen Mountain, Chongxian and other communes in the mountainous areas. Songbu Commune in Fengxin County, which has a large population but little land in the plain area, is cooperating with Zaoxi Commune in the mountainous area, which has a small population but a lot of land, for labor exchange. Songbu Commune is now transferring labor to support Zaoxi in spring plowing; Zaoxi Commune, because the rice transplanting season is later, has decided to support Songbu in transplanting rice seedlings. At the same time, Songbu Commune has also exchanged more than 25,000 jin of early rice seeds to Zaoxi Commune to support Zaoxi Commune's expansion of early rice planting. In order to help the Jiangping, Gaotang and other eight brigades in the mountainous area with colder climate to switch to early rice planting and transplant rice seedlings earlier, Gangshang Brigade of Gangshang Commune in Xiushui County took the initiative to lend 48 mu of fields with good sunshine and fertile soil to these eight brigades for raising seedlings, and sent experienced old farmers from their own brigade to serve as technical guidance for raising seedlings; when sorting out the seedling fields, if the mountainous teams lacked cattle, they borrowed cattle, and if they lacked plows and harrows, they borrowed plows and harrows. With such enthusiastic assistance from the commune members of Gangshang Brigade, the seedling fields of the mountainous teams have now all been plowed and harrowed twice, and are starting to be sown successively.

Activities of high-yield areas helping low-yield areas are also developing vigorously. According to the principle of equivalent exchange, the high-yield teams of each commune in Tonggu County sent more than 10,000 commune members to help low-yield teams adopt methods such as digging drainage ditches, deep plowing, and changing soil to transform more than 40,000 mu of low-yield fields. In order to help the Dongfeng Brigade in the low-yield area with a small workforce to accumulate and apply fertilizer to the low-yield fields, the Luzhou Brigade in the high-yield area of Huangduan Commune in Wuning County assigned the task of plowing and harrowing the fields of their own team to the female commune members, and extracted 42 strong male laborers to support the Dongfeng Brigade. After five days of hard work by the commune members of the two teams, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of the low-yield fields in the Dongfeng Brigade has increased from 180 dan to 407 dan, and all the low-yield fields have achieved sufficient water and fertilizer.

After the "Three Helps" movement was launched in various places, it further promoted the "Three Catch-Up" movement, and inspired the confidence and fighting spirit of the masses in poor teams, mountainous areas, and low-yield areas to catch up with rich teams, catch up with plain areas, and catch up with high-yield areas. Under the battle slogan of "The style of rich teams helping is high, self-reliance is more important, let's do a great job of turning the world upside down, and vow to compare and catch up with rich teams," the commune members of Datang, Huanglin, Guanghui and other seven poor teams in Huanghua Commune, Pengze County, worked hard in shifts to rush to cultivate the land and apply sufficient base fertilizer, creating conditions for expanding the planting of early rice. In order to strive for grain production to catch up with the plains, a large number of communes and teams in the mountainous area are not only grasping the measures to increase the unit area yield of early rice, but also launching a battle to get grain from barren mountains and wasteland. Thousands of commune members are fighting on the mountains during the day and lodging in mountain caves at night, carrying out intensive land reclamation and expansion of planting. Low-yield communes and teams issued the oath of "remove the hat of low-yield and put on the clothes of high-yield," setting up camps for hundreds of miles and stationed in the fields to greatly transform low-yield fields. Now the province has transformed more than 7 million mu of low-yield fields, with an average fertilizer application of more than 500 dan per mu. The commune members said: In the past, low-yield fields were "sanitary fields," but now low-yield fields are "fertilizer sea fields."

    江西“三帮”运动促进“三赶”运动
    发扬共产主义风格　富队帮穷队　平原帮山区　高产帮低产
    不断革命力争上游　穷队赶富队　山区赶平原　低产赶高产
    本报南昌20日电　江西各地掀起穷队赶富队、山区赶平原、低产赶高产的“三赶”运动之后，一个富队帮穷队、平原帮山区、高产区帮低产区的“三帮”高潮又在许多地区形成。这是今年江西农业生产中的一个重要特点。
    江西广大人民公社社员，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在人民公社、大跃进的伟大实践中，共产主义思想和风格迅速成长。人与人、队与队、社与社之间，已经为共同发展、共同富裕、共同建设社会主义事业的新思想联系起来。因此，当今年穷队、山区和低产区的广大社员，以冲天干劲掀起“三赶”运动之后，富队、平原和高产地区的社、队，立即针对穷队、山区和低产区大部分自然条件较差、田多人少劳力缺乏等困难，伸出友谊支援之手，掀起“三帮”运动，千方百计地帮助对方赶上和超过自己。高安县十六个公社的二百零五个富队，分别与六十九个穷队互相挂钩，订立了协作合同。协作范围除人力、物力以外，还建立了定期交流生产经验的会议制度。武宁县一百六十一个富队支援穷队的口号是：缺什么就支援什么，要什么就帮助什么，什么时候要什么时候帮。”箬溪公社东山、幸源、桥源、爱国四个富队，得知穷队泉溪大队在赶修灌田千亩的水库中，因工程大、力量小，汛前难以完工，便立刻派出一千六百多个强壮社员，扛着红旗，带着工具、粮食，来到工地支援，共同苦战十天，就提前完成了这项工程。
    平原帮山区更突破了队界、社界。信丰县平原地区的桃江、小河、大塘、正平等公社，都分别与山区的由山、金盆山、崇贤等公社建立了常年劳力换工协作合同。奉新县平原区人多田少的宋埠公社与人少田多的山区澡溪公社协作换工，宋埠公社现在抽调劳力支援澡溪春耕翻田；澡溪公社因插秧季节较迟，决定支援宋埠插秧。同时，宋埠公社还换给澡溪公社二万五千多斤早稻良种，支援澡溪公社扩种早稻。修水县岗上公社岗上大队为了帮助气候较冷的山区江平、高塘等八个大队改种早稻，提早插秧，主动借出四十八亩阳光好、土质肥的田给这八个大队育秧，并派了本队有经验的老农担任育秧技术指导；整理秧田时，山区队缺牛就借牛、缺犁耙就借犁耙。在岗上大队社员这样热情的援助下，现在山区队的秧田都做到了二犁二耙，正开始陆续播种。
    高产区帮低产区的活动，也开展得蓬蓬勃勃。铜鼓县各公社的高产队根据等价交换的原则，派出一万多名社员，帮低产队采取开挖排水沟、深耕、换土等办法，改造了低产田四万多亩。武宁县黄段公社高产地区的鹿洲大队，为了帮助劳力少的东风大队给低产田积肥施肥，本队的犁田耙田任务，交给女社员担当起来，抽出四十二名强壮男劳力，支援东风大队。经过两队社员五天苦战，东风大队的低产田，每亩施肥量已由一百八十担增加到四百零七担，全部低产田都做到了水足肥饱。
    各地掀起“三帮”运动以后，进一步推动了“三赶”运动，鼓舞了穷队、山区、低产地区群众赶富队、赶平原、赶高产区的信心和斗志。彭泽县黄花公社大塘、黄林、光辉等七个穷队的社员，在“富队帮助风格高，自力更生更重要，翻天复地干一场，誓与富队比赶超”的战斗口号下，分班苦战，抢耕土地，下足基肥，为扩种早稻创造了条件。大批山区的社、队为争取粮食生产赶平原，一面狠抓提高早稻单位面积产量的增产措施，一面展开了向荒山荒地要粮的战斗，成千上万的社员日战山头，夜宿山洞，紧张地进行着开荒扩种。低产社、队发出“摘掉低产帽，换上丰产衣”的誓言，百里连营，田间扎寨，大改低产田。现在全省已改造低产田七百多万亩，平均每亩施肥五百担以上。社员们说：过去低产田是“卫生田”，现在低产田是“肥海田”。
