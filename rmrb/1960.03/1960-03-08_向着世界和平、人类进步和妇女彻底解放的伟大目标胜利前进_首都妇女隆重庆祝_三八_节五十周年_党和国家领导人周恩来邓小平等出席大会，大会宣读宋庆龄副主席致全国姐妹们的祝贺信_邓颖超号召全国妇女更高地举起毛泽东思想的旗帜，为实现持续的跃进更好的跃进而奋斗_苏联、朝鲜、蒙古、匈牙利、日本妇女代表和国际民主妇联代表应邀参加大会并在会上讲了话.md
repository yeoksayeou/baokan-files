More than 10,000 women representatives from all walks of life in the audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.

Among the women from all walks of life participating in this meeting were female cadres who had participated in the Long March, representatives of some "March 8th Red Banner Holders" and "March 8th Red Banner Collectives" from various regions and Beijing, and ethnic minority women in Beijing.

At 3:00 PM, Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, announced the opening of the celebration meeting. Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke first. She extended a warm welcome on behalf of Chinese women and the presidium of today's meeting to the foreign guests present, and extended warm congratulations to the women from all walks of life in the capital attending the meeting.

After recounting the new developments in the international women's movement over the past fifty years, Deng Yingchao spoke about the glorious achievements of the Chinese women's movement under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, and under the promotion of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes. She called on women across the country to, together with the people of the whole country, hold even higher the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the three magic weapons for developing the cause of socialist construction, and strive to achieve continuous leap forwards and even better leap forwards.

Deng Yingchao said that in order to defend world peace and strive for the complete emancipation of women, Chinese women will unswervingly consolidate the unity of women in socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, consolidate the unity with women in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and consolidate the unity with all peace-loving women in all countries around the world. She said that the current situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us, and the enemies of peace and socialism have reached the end of their road. Let us inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of "March 8th" International Women's Day, hold high the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, and advance victoriously towards the great goal of world peace, human progress, and the complete emancipation of women. Her speech was greeted with extremely warm applause.

Soong Ching Ling, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, wrote a letter today to sisters on all fronts across the country and to heroines on all fronts, extending holiday greetings. When this congratulatory letter was read out at the meeting, the audience burst into thunderous applause.

Maria Dmitrievna Kovrigina, head of the Soviet women's delegation, Li Jong-soon, head of the Korean women's delegation, Zhanaa Hechigt, head of the Mongolian women's delegation, and Torguni, head of the Hungarian women's delegation, spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they conveyed the cordial greetings of the women of their countries to the Chinese women. When they spoke about the heroic spirit and outstanding achievements of the broad masses of women in the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, and Hungary in defending world peace and building socialism, the audience responded with extremely warm applause.

Maria Dmitrievna Kovrigina said in her speech that the Soviet people are celebrating International Women's Day amidst the excellent achievements in the struggle to complete the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule. Last year – 1959, which was called the year of the great victory of communist construction, the Soviet Union achieved great success in industrial and agricultural production. Soviet science and technology have achieved remarkable victories. Soviet women also actively participated in achieving all these great victories. Women account for almost half (47%) of workers and staff. In our country, 52% of experts with higher education are women. She said that all socialist countries have made great achievements in developing their economy and culture. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, which has been tested for a long time, the working people of China, after realizing the fundamental transformation of society and economy, are victoriously fighting to transform their motherland into a powerful socialist country. The glorious Chinese women have made great contributions to achieving these achievements.

Kovrigina concluded by saying that all progressive mankind, especially mothers, warmly support N.S. Khrushchev's passionate call for maintaining peace. Because peace is precious to all women in the world, and all children, whether black, white, or yellow, need peace so that they can grow up in joy and happiness.

Li Jong-soon said that the people of North Korea and China are brothers united under the banner of proletarian internationalism, and they are comrades-in-arms formed through long and arduous struggles. Through personal experience, Korean women deeply understand the power of proletarian internationalist thought. We will, together with the women of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving women around the world, devote ourselves to the struggle for lasting world peace and the freedom and rights of mothers and children around the world, and resolutely fight for the peaceful reunification of our motherland. Zhanaa Hechigt said that we Mongolian and Chinese women are true sisters who are ideologically consistent, united in purpose, and fighting together in the great cause of rapidly building socialist and communist homelands, and in striving for a better and happier life for mothers and children. Torguni said that the lives of women living in socialist countries are incomparably happier compared to women living under the oppression of capitalism and imperialism. While recounting the outstanding achievements of Hungarian women in building socialism, she said that we are faced with huge and glorious socialist construction tasks, and we are participants in realizing a beautiful life.

Fujiwara Michiko, head of the Japanese women's delegation, said in her speech that we, the Japanese women's delegation, are delighted from the bottom of our hearts to be able to participate in the glorious 50th anniversary celebration of "March 8th" International Women's Day together with Chinese friends who have completed the great revolutionary cause and achieved amazing leap forward achievements.

Fujiwara Michiko said that our country - Japan is currently in the midst of a great storm of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The reactionary Nobusuke Kishi government is stepping up its collusion with U.S. imperialism, attempting to stabilize the conservative regime, and frantically promoting its reactionary policies of undermining and oppressing the Japanese people. Today in Japan, the "National Conference to Stop the Revision of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'" composed of many democratic groups such as trade unions, women, religious and cultural groups is uniting to carry out the struggle. Fujiwara Michiko said that for the peace and happiness of Asia, and for world peace, the Japanese people and Japanese women will absolutely not allow the conspiracy of the reactionaries to succeed.

Gretel Müller, representative of the Women's International Democratic Federation, expressed warm congratulations to Chinese women. She said that we are proud of you, dear sisters, because of the achievements you have made in the people's communes and industry. Your work greatly contributes to the Great Leap Forward towards socialism. We congratulate you on your achievements and hope you will continue to achieve many achievements.

Gretel Müller said that under the leadership of our Women's International Democratic Federation, and inspired by the continuous achievements of women in the Soviet Union and China, we are fighting for our full human rights and for the realization of the complete disarmament proposed by the Soviet Union.

Representatives of women from socialist countries and Asian-African countries embassies in China, Ryu Kyung-hee, wife of the North Korean Ambassador to China, and D.A. Sinitsena, representative of Soviet female experts and experts' wives who are helping our country carry out socialist construction, also spoke at the meeting. Ryu Kyung-hee said, let us, together with peace-loving women around the world, unite closely and advance courageously for peace, for human justice and women's rights, and for a happy future for children. Sinitsena said, we are heartily happy for the outstanding achievements of our dear Chinese sisters. Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the women of the Soviet Union and China.

Four Beijing women representatives spoke at the meeting successively. They were: Sun Ziying, a female worker from the North China Radio Equipment United Factory, Hou Xiuying, Deputy Director of the Lugouqiao People's Commune in Fengtai District, Chi Jishang, Deputy Director of the General Survey Department and Director of the Petrology Teaching and Research Section of the Beijing Institute of Geology, and Tang Shuzhen, Director of the Jinqi Inlay Processing Factory of Jianguomen Street. They unanimously expressed: Under the situation of the motherland's rapid Great Leap Forward, in order to build socialism at high speed and in order to realize the great goal of communism in the future, women on the capital's industrial, agricultural, cultural and educational, scientific and health, street production, collective life welfare and social service fronts will, together with the people of the whole city and the whole country, hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, engage in technological revolution and cultural revolution on a large scale, work hard and skillfully, and make themselves red, diligent, skillful, and thrifty socialist working women, and make more outstanding contributions to the continuous leap forward of the capital's socialist construction. The audience repeatedly burst into stormy applause, expressing warm congratulations to the women of the capital.

After the speeches, the meeting unanimously passed a letter of salute to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and a congratulatory telegram to the Women's International Democratic Federation. When the letter of salute and congratulatory telegram were read out, the audience continuously applauded warmly.

The music of the Young Pioneers' song resounded in the venue, and 700 Young Pioneers in the capital, holding flowers and colorful balls high, entered the venue in six routes to present greetings and flowers. They used beautiful words to praise the great achievements of mothers, aunts, aunts, and older sisters in the national Great Leap Forward, and they presented bright bouquets to the Party and state leaders and the presidium of the meeting, expressing their high respect. Their arrival enlivened the entire venue, and the applause lasted for a long time.

A huge ceremonial team of more than 2,000 women from all walks of life in the capital came to the venue, and the venue suddenly presented a moving scene of hundreds of flowers blooming and a riot of color. The ceremonial team included women from all ethnic groups in the capital, including female employees and female commune members from factories, rural areas, and street production and service organizations; there were female workers in culture, education, medical care, sports, literature, and art, as well as female police officers, female militia members, and nursery staff. The female employees held high charts, models, and various new products showing their outstanding production achievements to report good news to the meeting. When they passed the rostrum one after another, the venue was boiling with thunderous applause, expressing warm congratulations to the women of the capital in the Great Leap Forward.

    藤原道子说，我们祖国——日本当前正处在修改日美“安全条约”的大风暴中，反动的岸信介政府正在加紧勾结美帝国主义，企图稳定保守政权，疯狂推行它破坏和压迫日本国民的反动政策。今天在日本国内，由工会、妇女、宗教和文化团体等许多民主团体组成的“阻止修改日美‘安全条约’国民会议”，正团结一致地进行着斗争。藤原道子说，为了亚洲的和平和幸福，为了世界和平，日本人民和日本妇女绝对不允许反动派的阴谋得逞。
