    A Critique of the 1960 Japanese Budget
    Lan Hai
    Amidst the fierce struggle between democratic progressive forces and reactionary forces surrounding the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives recently concluded its questioning of the 1960 budget proposal. Having passed the House of Representatives in early March, the budget proposal is now before the House of Councillors for deliberation and is expected to be finally passed in late March. The total revenue and expenditure of Japan's new fiscal year budget amount to 1,569,674,000,000 yen, an increase of 10.6% over the 1959 budget, making it the largest budget since the war.
    The new fiscal year budget proposal was finalized by the Kishi Nobusuke government on January 13th of this year, at which time it had already taken full account of the new circumstances of the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Therefore, this is the Japanese national budget for the first year of the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. It reflects the reactionary ruling clique's policy of harming the country and ruining the people by taking advantage of the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to step up arms expansion and war preparations, revive militarism, and further attack the people's livelihoods.
  Huge Military Spending Centered on Nuclear Armament
    Due to the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Japan has been further incorporated into the U.S. atomic strategy system in the Far East, undertaking heavy military obligations with the accelerated nuclear armament as the focal point. The direct military expenditure under the name of "Defense Agency expenses" in the 1960 budget increased by 12.5 billion yen over the previous year, reaching 148,552,000,000 yen. Adding the general "defense expenses" of 6,025,000,000 yen, the total military expenditure amounts to 154.5 billion yen.
    The direct military expenditure of the so-called "Defense Agency expenses," in addition to being used for arms expansion (an increase of 8,300 personnel in the army, navy, and air force, an increase in naval vessels to 116,000 tons, and an increase in air force aircraft to 1,115), will also be used to purchase 60 "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles from the United States, build destroyers and submarines capable of equipping missile launchers, train troops to use "Nike" missiles, and research missile production technology.
    The direct military expenditure for the new fiscal year is large enough, but it still cannot meet the Kishi Nobusuke government's demand to accelerate nuclear armament. In order to deceive the people, the Kishi Nobusuke government has also used the name of "national debt burden" in the new fiscal year budget to increase the direct military expenditure by 91,865,000,000 yen. This expenditure is not formally included in the official budget for 1960 on the surface, but it is actually an expenditure for this year. If this "hidden expenditure" of 91.8 billion yen is added, Japan's direct military expenditure for the new fiscal year will exceed 200 billion yen. The Kishi Nobusuke government will use this money to vigorously implement the nuclear weapons equipment of the "Self-Defense Forces." At present, the reorganized Japanese army divisions have begun to possess atomic warfare forces. This autumn, after the 7th Mixed Group in Makomanai, Hokkaido, completes its mechanized equipment, it will be an atomic warfare force composed of three combat teams, with "Honest John" missiles as its main force. The Navy is beginning to build destroyers equipped with the latest U.S. "Tartar" missiles. In addition, the Army is also preparing to send personnel equivalent to a battalion to the United States for missile training. After returning to China, they will become the backbone of the "Nike" missile force.
    According to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the United States will continue to occupy Japan as its military base. Therefore, the 6 billion yen of general "defense expenses" in the new fiscal year budget will be used as expenses for providing bases to the U.S. military and as funds for supporting the U.S. military advisory group. This expenditure alone is enough to illustrate Japan's subordinate status to the United States in military affairs.
  Serving the Overseas Expansion of Monopoly Capital
     Another characteristic of the 1960 Japanese budget is that, in order to step up the revival of militarism after the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Kishi Nobusuke government opened the national treasury to satisfy the ambitions of Japanese monopoly capital to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia. In this budget, the Kishi Nobusuke government's financial investment and loan scale for monopoly capital reached 594.1 billion yen.
    In the new budget year, the Kishi Nobusuke government will provide large amounts of low-interest loans to monopoly capitalists to help them expand equipment, promote so-called "industrial rationalization," and cruelly exploit workers in order to strengthen their ability to export goods and capital to Southeast Asia. The Kishi Nobusuke government not only vigorously increases various construction investments that are beneficial to monopoly capital, but also takes special tax reduction measures and reduces transportation costs, land prices, and other methods to increase the capital accumulation of monopoly enterprises. As for the large capitalists in the coal mining and shipping industries who are in a panic due to the anarchy of capitalist production, they can also receive many benefits from the government's interest-free loans according to the new fiscal year budget.
    In order to carry out expansion in Southeast Asia, a budget related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Kishi Nobusuke government's 1960 budget reached 12.8 billion yen, an increase of nearly 1.6 billion yen over the previous year. This budget is mainly used for various expenditures such as "economic cooperation fees," "Colombo Plan cooperation fees," "technical cooperation fees," "Mekong River comprehensive development entrustment fees," and "subsidies." If we add the 5 billion yen of the so-called "Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund" recently established, then monopoly capital already has the backing of national financial assistance in its overseas expansion.
    In contrast, the Kishi Nobusuke government appears to be very stingy towards small and medium-sized enterprises that urgently need help. Small and medium-sized enterprises in Japan account for more than 90% of the total number of enterprises, but the financial investment and loans for small and medium-sized enterprises are only 2.53 billion yen, accounting for 0.16% of the total budget expenditure. Not only that, but only those small and medium-sized enterprises that have close subordinate relationships with large monopoly capital can get a little benefit from this meager budget. The vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises get nothing at all. Moreover, in the future, as monopoly concentration strengthens, the big fish eat the small fish, and the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises is even more unimaginable.
      Expenditure for the Revival of Militarism
    In Japan's new fiscal year budget, there is a so-called "pension fee" of more than 130 billion yen, which is mainly issued to former servicemen. This money has increased by hundreds of billions of yen compared to the previous year. The power of former servicemen has now become a social pillar for the revival of militarism in Japan. After the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese government has attached greater importance to this reactionary force, and therefore does not hesitate to increase the budget to cultivate it.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's reactionary intention to revive the military police state is also reflected in the new fiscal year's budget. According to publicly released figures from the Japanese National Police Agency, the total amount of so-called "public security related expenses" for this year reached 63,099,130,000 yen. This expenditure is mainly used for the activities of police secret agents. This includes expenses for buying information, "informant rewards," and secret agent disguise (such as plastic surgery to dress up as blind people) and overseas activities. Starting from April this year, an intelligence organization called the "Public Relations Office" will be established in the Japanese Prime Minister's Office, specializing in collecting information on the ideological trends of leaders of workers' movements, farmers' movements, progressive politicians, and cultural figures. At the same time, in order to adapt to the new system of the Japan-U.S. military alliance, the Japanese reactionary authorities have also increased funding for collecting overseas intelligence. The "Cabinet Investigation Office" established by the Kishi Nobusuke government's cabinet secretariat has a formal staff of only eight people, but it has been allocated a budget of 299,730,000 yen. With the revival of the Japanese military police state, the Japanese government's budget in this area will actually increase significantly. Obviously, this kind of budgetary expenditure by the Kishi Nobusuke government is an attack on the democratic rights of the Japanese people and the peace and security of Asia.
          Attacking the People's Livelihood
    Japan's new fiscal year budget fully demonstrates its class nature of safeguarding the interests of monopoly capital. The vast majority of budget revenue comes from taxes squeezed from the broad masses of the people. However, the broad masses of the people receive no benefit at all, except to bear the heavy military police expenses or to suffer sacrifices for the prosperity of monopoly capital. In order to deceive the people, the Japanese government has set up so-called "living protection fees" and "unemployment countermeasures fees" and other "social security related fees" in the budget. However, this money amounts to only a few thousand yen per person per year among the more than 10 million people who are severely struggling with unemployment and underemployment (according to statistics from the "Akahata" newspaper, an average worker needs more than 11,000 yen a year just to smoke the cheapest cigarettes).
    The Japanese capitalist economy has survived the economic crisis of 1957-1958, and the "recovery" of industrial production in 1959 has exceeded the highest point before the crisis. However, this "recovery" was achieved by monopoly capital through means such as laying off workers, lowering wages, compressing operating rates, and strengthening cartelization to maintain monopoly high profits. Precisely because of this, the economic "recovery" not only cannot improve the lives of the working class and the broad working people, but instead makes them increasingly impoverished. In the future, with the "opening the door" of the traitorous monopoly capital group for American goods and capital and the strengthening of the collusion between Japanese and American monopoly capital, competition between large monopoly enterprises will intensify, small and medium-sized enterprises will deteriorate, and the vast number of workers and working people will fall into a more painful situation.
    Based on the above situation, it can be predicted that the result of the implementation of this year's Japanese budget will promote the forces of militarism revival due to the increase in military police expenses. At the same time, the huge financial investment and loans will promote monopoly capital to expand equipment investment more unplanned, thus creating a fuse for the crisis of overproduction and further intensifying domestic class contradictions. Furthermore, due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's funding of the collusion between Japanese monopoly capital and American monopoly capital and its expansion into Southeast Asia, the contradictions between the Japanese reactionaries and the Asian people will also be further deepened. In the end, the Japanese national budget for the first year of the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty will not alleviate but deepen the financial and economic difficulties of the Japanese reactionary ruling group. It seems that there is some basis for the concern of Japanese bourgeois newspapers such as the "Asahi Shimbun" when commenting on the budget proposal about the consequences of "excessive stimulation."

    评1960年度日本预算
    蓝海
    在民主进步力量同反动势力围绕日美军事同盟条约进行激烈的斗争中，日本国会众议院最近结束了1960年度预算案的质询。这一预算案在3月上旬于众议院通过后，即交参议院审议，预计在3月下旬最后通过。日本新年度预算收支总额均为一万五千六百九十六亿七千四百万日元，比1959年度预算增加10．6％，是战后最庞大的预算。
    新年度预算案是岸信介政府于今年1月13日确定的，当时它就已经充分考虑到签订日美军事同盟条约的新情况。因此，这是日美签订军事同盟条约第一年的日本国家预算。它反映了日本反动统治集团借签订新的日美“安全条约”而加紧推行扩军备战、复活军国主义和进一步向人民生活进攻的祸国殃民政策。
  以核武装为中心的庞大军费
    由于签订了日美军事同盟条约，日本被进一步纳入美国在远东的原子战略体系，承担起以加速核武装为重点的沉重军事义务。1960年度预算中以“防卫厅经费”为名的直接军费开支比上一年度增加一百二十五亿日元，达一千四百八十五亿五千二百万日元，加上一般“防卫开支”六十亿二千五百万日元，军费开支总额达一千五百四十五亿日元。
    所谓“防卫厅经费”的直接军费开支，除了用于扩军（陆海空军人员增加八千三百人，海军舰艇增为十一万六千吨，空军飞机增为一千一百一十五架）外，还要从美国购买六十枚“响尾蛇式”空对空导弹，建造能装备导弹发射装置的驱逐舰和潜水艇，训练使用
  “奈克式”导弹部队，以及研究导弹的生产技术。
    新年度的直接军费开支本来够大了，但是还不能满足岸信介政府加速实行核武装的要求。岸信介政府为了蒙蔽人民的耳目，在新年度预算中除直接军费开支以外还用“国库债务负担”的名目，为直接军费开支增加了九百一十八亿六千五百万日元。这笔开支表面上不列入1960年度的正式预算，实际上是本年度开支的。如果加上这九百一十八亿日元的“隐蔽开支”，新年度日本直接军费将超过二千多亿日元。岸信介政府将用这笔钱大力实行“自卫队”的核武器装备。目前，经过改编后的日本陆军师团已经着手拥有原子作战的兵力。今年秋天北海道真驹内的第七混成团完成机甲装备以后，将是一支由三个战斗队组成的、以“诚实的约翰式”导弹为主力的原子作战部队。海军开始建造装备美国最新式“鞑靼式”导弹的驱逐舰。此外，陆军还准备派相当于一个大队的人员赴美接受导弹训练，回国后将成为“奈克式”导弹部队的骨干。
    根据日美军事同盟条约，美国将继续霸占日本作为它的军事基地。因此，新年度预算中一般“防卫开支”的六十亿日元，将充作向美军提供基地所需的费用，以及供养美国军事顾问团的经费。仅这项开支，就足以说明日本在军事上对美国从属的地位。
  为垄断资本的对外扩张效劳
     1960年度日本预算的另一特点，就是岸信介政府为了在签订日美军事同盟条约后加紧复活军国主义，敞开国库，来满足日本垄断资本向东南亚实行经济扩张的野心。在这次预算中，岸信介政府对垄断资本的财政投资放款规模达五千九百四十一亿日元。
    在新的预算年度，岸信介政府将以低利大量放款给垄断资本家，帮助他们扩大设备，推行所谓“产业合理化”，残酷地剥削工人，以加强对东南亚输出商品和资本的能力。岸信介政府不仅大力增强有利于垄断资本的各种建设投资，而且采取特别减税措施和减轻运输费用、地价等办法，来增加垄断企业的资本积累。至于那些因资本主义生产无政府状态而陷于恐慌的煤矿业和海运业的大资本家，还可以根据新年度预算得到政府无利贷款的很多好处。
    为了向东南亚实行扩张，在岸信介政府1960年度预算中同外务省有关的一笔预算达一百二十八亿日元，比上一年度增加近十六亿日元。这笔预算主要用于所谓“经济合作费”、“科伦坡计划合作费”、“技术合作费”、“湄公河综合开发委托费”以及“补助费”等各项开支。如果加上最近设立的所谓“对外经济合作基金”五十亿日元，那末垄断资本在向海外扩张中已经有了国家财政资助的后盾了。
    与此相反，岸信介政府对于急需帮助的中小企业却显得非常之刻薄。日本中小企业占整个企业总数的90％以上，但是对中小企业的财政投资放款却只有二十五亿三千万日元，占整个预算支出的0．16％。不仅如此，在这笔微不足道的预算中，能够得到一点好处的又只有那些同大垄断资本有密切的从属关系的中小企业。广大中小企业根本得不到什么好处。况且，今后由于垄断集中加强，大鱼吃小鱼，中小企业的处境更是不堪设想的。
      复活军国主义的开支
    日本新年度预算中，有一千三百多亿日元的所谓“恩给费”，主要是发给旧军人的，这笔钱比上一年度增加了几百亿日元。旧军人势力目前已经成了日本复活军国主义的一个社会支柱。在日美军事同盟条约签订后，日本政府更加重视这一反动势力，因此不惜增加预算来培植它。
    岸信介政府为了复活军事警察国家的反动意图在新年度的预算中也有所反映。据日本警察厅发表的公开数字，今年度的所谓“治安关系费”总额达六百三十亿九千九百一十三万日元。这笔开支主要用于警察特务的活动费。这里包括收买情报、“告密酬金”，以及特务化装（如装扮瞎子等整形手术）和出国活动费用等在内。从今年4月起，日本政府总理府内将设立“广报室”的情报组织，专门收集工人运动、农民运动的领导人、进步政治家和文化界人士的思想动向。同时，为了适应日美军事同盟新体制，日本反动当局还增加了收集海外情报的经费。岸信介政府内阁官房设立的“内阁调查室”正式编制只有八人，却拨给二亿九千九百七十三万日元的预算。随着日本军事警察国家的复活，日本政府在这方面的预算实际上将会大大增加。显然，岸信介政府的这种预算开支，是向日本人民民主权利和亚洲和平与安全进攻的。
          向人民生活进攻
    日本新年度预算充分地表现了它维护垄断资本利益的阶级性。预算收入的绝大部分是从广大人民搜刮来的税金。但是，广大人民除担负沉重的军事警察费用或为垄断资本发财致富而承受牺牲外，根本得不到任何好处。日本政府为了欺骗人民，在预算中设立了所谓“生活保护费”和“失业对策费”等“社会保障关系费”。但是，这笔钱在一千多万生活严重困难的失业和半失业人口中，平均每人每年不过几千日元（据“赤旗报”统计，普通一个工人每年吸最便宜的纸烟也需要一万一千多日元）。
    日本资本主义经济已经熬过了1957—1958年的经济危机，1959年工业生产的“回升”已经超过危机前的最高点。但是，这种“回升”，是垄断资本靠解雇工人、降低工资、压缩开工率以及加强卡特尔化等维持垄断高额利润的手段实现的。正是因为这样，经济“回升”不仅不能改善工人阶级和广大劳动人民的生活，反而使他们日益贫困化。今后随着卖国垄断资本集团为美国商品和资本“开放门户”和日美垄断资本勾结的加强，大垄断企业之间竞争加剧，中小企业每况愈下，广大工人和劳动人民将陷于更加痛苦的境地。
    基于上述情况，可以预料，今年日本预算执行的结果将因增加军事警察费用而助长军国主义复活的势力，同时因庞大的财政投资放款促使垄断资本更加无计划地扩大设备投资，因而为生产过剩危机制造导火线，进一步加剧国内阶级矛盾。再则，由于岸信介政府资助日本垄断资本同美国垄断资本的勾结和向东南亚扩张，日本反动派同亚洲人民的矛盾也会进一步加深。结局，日美签订军事同盟条约第一年的日本国家预算，将不是缓和而是加深日本反动统治集团在财政经济上的困难。像“朝日新闻”等日本资产阶级报纸在评论预算案时都耽心“过火的刺激”的后果，看来是不无根据的。
