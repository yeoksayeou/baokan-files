    "Earth Fire Cage" Hotbed Cultivation of Cotton Seedlings
    This method of cultivating seedlings can result in earlier seedlings, extend the cotton growing season, and greatly increase yields.
    The Jianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Jianyang County is a major cotton-producing area in Sichuan Province. In 1959, the county's 560,000 mu of cotton averaged 73 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 27% over 1958.

    Through years of experience in high-yield cotton production, we have realized that extending the cotton growing season is the primary key to achieving high cotton yields. Based on the long growing characteristics of cotton and the long frost-free period in Jianyang County, it is entirely possible to extend the cotton growing season. We mainly focus on two aspects: on the one hand, early sowing to vigorously promote summer bolls and mid-season bolls; on the other hand, extending the late-stage growth to vigorously promote autumn bolls. In order to advance sowing and transplanting, our county has created the "earth fire cage" hotbed seedling cultivation method. In 1959, 100,000 mu of cotton in the county were cultivated and transplanted using this method, with an average yield of up to 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu. After summarizing experience, our "earth fire cage" hotbeds this year have been improved in several ways based on last year's, and we have decided to widely promote this seedling cultivation experience throughout the county.

    "Earth fire cage" hotbed seedling cultivation requires selecting sandy soil with a slight slope, facing the sun, and sheltered from the wind for the seedbed. Create seedbeds that are two zhang long and six chi wide, with each bed generally having three "cages." Dig three "cage" ditches under each bed, each five or six cun in height and width. Construct the "cage" entrance at the lower end and the "cage" tail at the higher end. Build a stove at the "cage" entrance and a chimney at the "cage" tail, connecting the stove and chimney so that a fire can be lit. Make a diversion opening one chi away from the stove to allow smoke and fire to enter the side "cages," and then merge the "cages" into a chimney again at a distance of one chi five cun to two chi from the "cage" tail. After the "cages," stoves, and chimneys are prepared, lay cotton stalks or bamboo on the "cage" ditches, then pad a layer of five or six cun of brewing material (compost, weeds, cottonseed hulls, distillers' grains, etc.), and then spread soil and divide it into grids for "square grid seedling cultivation." Each grid is two cun wide, sow three seeds per grid, cultivate twenty-five seedlings per square chi, three thousand seedlings per bed, and ten thousand seedlings per mu. Build soil ridges around the seedbed and cover with sun mats or straw curtains for insulation. After starting the fire, keep it burning day and night, maintaining a surface soil temperature of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. After seedling emergence, it can be reduced to 15 to 20 degrees Celsius. Uncover during the day for light and cover at night to prevent frost. After the cotton seedlings turn green, the temperature can be gradually lowered to improve their cold resistance. Transplanting can be done after the cotyledons have grown and stretched.

    According to the situation in Jianyang County, when the temperature is stable above 12 degrees Celsius in mid-March, it is the starting temperature for cotton growth. Strengthening field management after transplanting will allow it to grow normally.

    The advantages of "earth fire cage" hotbed seedling cultivation are as follows:

    First, it can enable early sowing and early seedlings, extend the cotton growing season, and greatly increase yields. Taking the cotton demonstration field of the county party committee as an example, in early March 1959, the method of sowing with "earth fire cage" hotbeds resulted in widespread seedling emergence in just three days, more than fifty days earlier than the late-flower seedling emergence of the past when sowing during Grain Rain. The time of budding and flowering was also more than forty days earlier. Early sowing and early flowering captured a large number of summer bolls, and at the same time played a great role in stabilizing mid-season bolls and autumn bolls. In the later stage of cotton growth, continue to vigorously promote autumn bolls, and finally uproot the stalks at the end of October, more than a month later than the past when the stalks were uprooted at the Autumn Equinox. In this way, the cotton growing season was extended from five months in the past to eight months. Due to early sowing at the Awakening of Insects, extending the cotton growing season resulted in a yield more than 60% higher than mid-season cotton sown during Qingming, and more than twice as high as late-season cotton sown during Grain Rain.

    Second, it can ensure the vigorous growth of cotton seedlings in the early stage of low temperature. At the same time, because a batch of summer bolls is stabilized in the early stage, it can effectively prevent excessive growth and boll shedding in summer. Early flowering and boll setting can avoid the damage of strong winds and rain in June and July, and simultaneously secure summer, mid-season, and autumn bolls.

    Third, it can advance the flowering period of cotton, allowing it to cross-pollinate with early-spring flowering peach blossoms, citrus flowers, pomelo flowers, etc., to create large-boll cotton varieties. In 1959, the Cotton Feng Commune used this method to create a twelve-lobed large-boll cotton variety.

    Fourth, advancing the time of cotton seedling cultivation and transplanting can avoid the phenomenon of competing for labor between planting cotton and harvesting winter crops, which is conducive to resolving labor contradictions.

    Fifth, the "earth fire cage" hotbed not only cultivates seedlings, but also fumigates the soil, and the burned grass ash can also be used as fertilizer, providing fumigated soil fertilizer for the cotton field, killing two birds with one stone.

    Sixth, the "earth fire cage" hotbed does not require formal building materials, saving costs and achieving great results. The method is simple and easy for the masses to master.

    “地火笼”温床育棉苗
    这种育苗法，可以早得苗，延长棉花生长期，大大提高产量。
    中共简阳县委会
    简阳县是四川省的主要产棉区。1959年，全县五十六万亩棉花，平均亩产七十三斤（皮棉），比1958年增加27％。
    通过历年来棉花丰产经验，我们认识到延长棉花生长期，是夺取棉花高产的首要环节。根据棉花有长年生长的特点和简阳县无霜期长的自然条件，延长棉花生长期是完全可能的。我们主要是从两方面下手：一方面是提早播种，大抓夏桃、伏桃；另一方面是延长后期生长，大抓秋桃。为了提早播种和移栽，我县创造了“地火笼”温床育苗的办法。1959年，全县有十万亩棉花是用这种办法育苗移栽的，平均亩产皮棉高达一百一十斤。经过总结经验，我们今年的“地火笼”温床又在去年的基础上作了若干改进，并决定在全县范围内普遍推广这一育苗经验。
    “地火笼”温床育苗需要选择地势稍带倾斜，向阳背风的沙质土壤做苗床，开成长二丈、宽六尺的苗厢，一厢一般三“笼”，每厢下开三条“笼”沟，高宽各五、六寸；低处作“笼”口，高处为“笼”尾；“笼”口筑灶，“笼”尾砌囱，灶囱相通，即可生火。距灶一尺远处做分火口，使烟火通入侧“笼”，在“笼”尾一尺五寸至二尺远处又合摆入囱。“笼”和灶、囱做好后，在“笼”沟上铺棉秆或竹子，再垫一层五、六寸厚的酿垫物（堆肥、杂草、棉子壳、酒糟等），然后铺土划格作“方格育苗”，每格宽二寸，下种三粒，每平方尺育苗二十五株，每厢育苗三千株，每亩育苗一万株。苗床四周作土埂，上盖晒席或草帘以保温。生火后昼夜不停，保持表土温度摄氏二十至三十度，出苗后可降至十五度至二十度，白天揭盖透光，夜晚加盖防冻。棉苗转青后可逐渐降温，以锻炼其耐寒性，待胎叶生长伸展后即可移栽。
    根据简阳县的情况，3月中旬气温稳定在摄氏十二度以上，就是棉花生长的起点温度，移栽后加强田间管理，即可正常生长。
    “地火笼”温床育苗的好处有以下几点：
    一，能够早播种、早得苗，延长棉花生长期，大大提高产量。以县委棉花指挥田为例，1959年3月初，用“地火笼”温床育苗的办法下种，仅三天时间，棉苗就普遍出土，比过去谷雨播种的迟花出苗期提早了五十多天，现蕾开花的时间也提早了四十多天。早播种，早开花，抓到了大批的夏桃，同时对于多稳伏桃、秋桃也起了很大作用。在棉花生长后期，继续大抓秋桃，到10月底才最后拔秆，比过去秋分拔秆推迟了一个月以上。这样，就使得棉花生长期从过去的五个月延长到八个月。由于提早在惊蛰播种，延长了棉花的生长期，产量比清明播种的中花高出60％以上，比谷雨播种的迟花高出二倍。
    二，能够在前期低温的情况下，保证棉苗茁壮成长。同时，由于前期座稳了一批夏桃，在夏季能有效地防止陡长和落蕾。提早开花结桃，可以避免6、7月大风雨的损害，把夏、伏、秋三桃同时把住。
    三，能够提早棉花开花期，使它和早春开花的桃花、柑橘花、柚子花等进行远缘杂交，创造出大桃棉品种。1959年，棉丰公社就用这种办法创造出十二瓣的大桃棉品种。
    四，提早棉花的育苗移栽时间后，可避免种棉与收获越冬作物之间的抢工现象，有利于解决劳动力的矛盾。
    五，“地火笼”温床既育了苗，又熏了土，烧的草灰也可以作肥料，为棉田提供了熏土肥料，一举两得。
    六，“地火笼”温床不需要正规的建筑材料，费省效宏，方法简易，群众易于掌握。
