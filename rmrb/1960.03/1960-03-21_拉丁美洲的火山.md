    Latin American Volcanoes
    Liu Feng
    Latin America is a region with many volcanoes, with about forty or fifty volcanoes of various sizes. These volcanoes are mainly distributed along the western edge of South America, Central America, and the islands of the Caribbean Sea. Countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica are all countries with many volcanoes.
    In the past, in the Earth's history, Latin America had even more volcanoes than it does today, and they were larger in scale. Many volcanoes have now become inactive.
    Although volcanoes are "dying," they are also continuing to be created. The Paricutin volcano in western Mexico is one that people witnessed growing; the land where this volcano is located was originally farmland, and before the volcanic activity, farmers felt that the land was particularly warm. On February 20, 1943, a small crack suddenly appeared in the ground, and puffs of smoke emerged. At first, people thought it was burning leaves, but around five o'clock in the afternoon, the earth made a loud rumbling sound, the crack widened, thick smoke shot into the sky like a pillar, and many sand and rocks were also ejected. Two days later, red-hot lava flowed out, and these ejected materials quickly formed a cone-shaped mountain peak around the crater, growing taller day by day. On the second day of the volcano's eruption, it was only ten meters high, but a month later, it had grown to more than one hundred meters. This volcano continued to erupt until March 4, 1952, when it stopped erupting, leaving only wisps of smoke, which then disappeared. But who can guarantee that it will not suddenly erupt again? A volcano on the island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, after a long period of inactivity, erupted violently on May 8, 1902, and the ejected hot smoke and clouds caused significant damage to nearby cities.
    However, volcanoes often have precursors before they erupt. After mastering their patterns, it is entirely possible to avoid their hazards. Conversely, volcanoes not only bring magnificent scenery but, more importantly, bring economic benefits. The volcanic ash ejected by volcanoes contains rich minerals, which can make the soil fertile. Volcanoes eject a lot of volcanic ash; within five hundred kilometers of the Paricutin volcano, there is volcanic ash provided by this volcano, and the thickest accumulation is up to one hundred and fifty meters. In fact, not this much is needed to give coffee trees, fruit trees, and so on good "nutrition." This is one of the reasons why Guatemala and other countries have become important fruit producers. In Mexico, the valleys near volcanoes have the densest population, also because the land there is fertile.
    Why are there so many volcanoes in Latin America? Because this is an active zone on Earth, and the mountains here are young mountains that formed relatively recently. Even today, the movement has not completely stopped. The difference in elevation here is so great; the Andes Mountains on the western edge of South America are generally four to five thousand meters high or more, while the adjacent trenches are more than seven thousand meters deep, forming a zone where the Earth's crust is particularly uneven in thickness. This imbalance promotes the movement of the Earth's crust, causing it to crack, allowing underground magma to rush out and become volcanoes. Earthquakes are particularly frequent in these areas, also demonstrating the significant characteristics of crustal movement.
    The people of Latin America have survived and developed in the struggle against these powerful forces of nature such as volcanoes and earthquakes. When facing the national enemy, American imperialism, they have shown an even more tenacious and heroic character. They are destroying the colonizers pressing down on them with the force of a thunderous volcano eruption! In Guatemala, there is a legend about the Agua volcano, which is said to have destroyed the city occupied by the Spanish colonizers two hours after sunset on September 10, 1541, retribution falling on those who cruelly suppressed the Indians. Now the retribution of American imperialism sitting on the volcano's crater has really come, but this is not a natural volcano, but the people's anger, which is incomparably more powerful than a volcano!

    拉丁美洲的火山
    柳风
    拉丁美洲是个多火山的地区，大大小小的火山约在四、五十座以上，这些火山主要分布在南美洲西部边缘、中美洲和加勒比海一带的岛屿上，像墨西哥、危地马拉、哥斯达黎加等都是多火山的国家。
    过去在地球的历史上，拉丁美洲的火山比今天还要多，规模很大，到现在许多火山已经不再活动了。
    火山虽然在“死亡”，同时却在继续产生。墨西哥西部的帕里库丁火山就是人们亲眼看着它长起来的；这座火山所在的地方本来是一片庄稼地，在火山活动以前，种地的农民就感到土地特别温暖。1943年2月20日，地下突然出现了一个小的裂口，并冒出了阵阵的烟雾，开始人们还以为是枯叶着了火，可是到下午五点钟左右，大地发出了轰隆的巨响，裂缝张大了，浓烟像柱子似地冲向天空，许多砂石也被喷射起来，两天后流出了赤热的熔岩，这些喷出物很快在火山口周围堆成了锥形的山峰，一天天增高，火山刚刚喷发的第二天还仅有十米高，而一个月后就高到一百多米了。这个火山一直活动到1952年3月4日才停止了喷发，只剩下缕缕轻烟，随即也消失了，但是谁能担保它不再突然喷发呢？加勒比海中马丁尼克岛上的一个火山，在长期停止活动以后，于1902年5月8日猛烈喷发，喷出的高热烟云给附近的城市造成重大损害。
    不过火山在喷发以前常常是有预兆的，在掌握它的规律以后，完全可以避免它的危害，相反地火山不仅带来了壮丽的景色，更重要的是带来了经济上的利益。火山喷出的火山灰含有丰富的矿物质，能使土壤肥沃，而火山喷出的火山灰是很多的，在帕里库丁火山附近五百公里以内的地方都有这个火山提供的火山灰，堆积得最厚的地方可达一百五十米，其实用不了这许多就足以使咖啡树、果树等得到良好的“营养”，这是使危地马拉等国成为重要的水果产地的原因之一。在墨西哥，邻近火山的山谷人口最密，也是因为那里土地肥沃。
    为什么拉丁美洲的火山特别多呢？因为这里是地球上的活动地带，这里的山是形成较晚的年青的山。到今天运动也还未完全停止，这里的地势高低相差又是如此悬殊，南美洲西缘的安第斯山一般高四、五千米以上，而与此紧邻的海沟最深达七千多米，形成了地壳厚薄特别不均的地带，这种不均衡促进了地壳的运动，使地壳发了裂缝，地下的岩浆得以乘隙冲出成为火山。这些地带地震特别多，也表现了地壳运动显著的特点。
    拉丁美洲的人民就是在和火山、地震这些强大的自然力斗争中生存发展起来的，在面对民族的敌人美帝国主义的时候，他们更加表现出了坚韧不拔、英勇豪迈的性格。他们正像火山喷发一样以雷霆万钧之力摧毁压在他们头上的殖民者。在危地马拉流传着一个关于阿古阿火山的传说，据说在1541年9月10日太阳落山以后两小时，这座火山毁灭了西班牙殖民者所占据的城市，报应落到那些残酷镇压印第安人的人们身上。现在坐在火山口上的美帝国主义的报应真的来到了，不过这不是自然界的火山，而是比火山威力大得不可比拟的人民的怒火！
