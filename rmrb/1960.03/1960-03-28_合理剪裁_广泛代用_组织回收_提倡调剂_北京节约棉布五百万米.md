    Beijing Saves 5 Million Meters of Cotton Cloth
    (Xinhua News Agency) Beijing has launched a mass movement to save cotton cloth. In the past year or so, it has saved more than 5 million meters of cotton cloth and produced more than 3.4 million meters of wild fiber cloth and recycled cloth.
    Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Textile Products Purchasing and Supply Station and the textile product wholesale departments of various districts have extensively linked up with factories and enterprises, making the saving of cotton cloth an important part of the socialist labor competition. All departments in the city have widely adopted various measures such as "alteration," "substitution," "recycling," "repair," "adjustment," and "leasing" to save a large amount of cotton cloth.
    "Alteration" means improving cotton cloth cutting and production methods on the premise of ensuring product quality. Sewing factories and production cooperatives have saved hundreds of thousands of meters of cotton cloth by doing everything possible to improve cutting methods. The oilcloth raincoats made by the Beijing Oilcloth Factory have eliminated the front cape, which has little effect on rain protection, saving more than three feet of cloth per raincoat, and are also beautiful and inexpensive. Over the past year, the city has rationally improved 15 types of cotton cloth specifications, saving more than 12,000 jin of various cotton yarns.
    "Substitution" means widely using wild fibers and recycled fibers made from old cotton and rags to replace cotton yarn and process them into wild fiber cloth and recycled cloth. The city saved more than 1 million meters of cotton cloth in just one year by using substitutes to produce tents and tarpaulins.
    "Recycling" means that commercial departments and relevant factories and enterprises are linked up to vigorously recycle wrapping cloth, old cloth, and old yarn, which are processed separately and used rationally. For example, printing factories have tens of thousands of meters of cloth stained with ink every season, and some textile mills and dyeing factories have residual cotton yarn. Commercial departments collect these old cloths and yarns and transfer them to relevant factories to make shoe soles, vehicle ropes, net bags, and shoelaces.
    "Repair" means that many clothing factories, production cooperatives, and street factories in the city accept the work of altering large to small and renewing old work clothes and clothing, and fully utilize scraps and rags to sew together various commodities such as school bags, children's clothing, children's toys, cushions, and vests. These products have low costs and beautiful and generous styles, making them best-selling goods in the market. Over the past year, the city has used 530,000 meters of scraps to make various finished products.
    "Adjustment" means that commercial departments regularly review cotton cloth sales data, visit cloth-using units, and adjust surplus materials to share what they have.
    "Leasing" means that specialized leasing institutions are established to lease cotton cloth to temporary cloth-using units. For example, a similar institution recently established in Beijing has leased more than 3,000 meters of cotton cloth to more than 30 factories, enterprises, and institutions in just over 20 days, solving the cloth needs of these units for holding on-site meetings, holding exhibitions, and covering temporary materials.

    北京节约棉布五百万米
    据新华社讯　北京市开展群众性节约棉布运动，一年多来共节约五百多万米棉布，并且生产了三百四十多万米野生纤维布和再生布。
    在中共北京市委领导下，北京市纺织品采购供应站和各区纺织品批发部同各工厂企业广泛挂钩，把节约棉布作为社会主义劳动竞赛的重要内容之一。全市各部门广泛采用了“改”、“代”、“回收”、“修补”、“调剂”、“租赁”等多种措施，节约了大量棉布。
    “改”，就是在保证产品质量的前提下，改进棉布裁剪和生产方法。各缝纫厂和生产合作社由于千方百计地改进裁剪方法，已经节约了几十万米棉布。北京油布厂制做的油布雨衣，取消了淋湿度不大的前披肩，一件雨衣就能节省三尺多布，而且美观、价格便宜。一年来全市已合理改进了十五种棉布规格，节约各种棉纱一万二千多斤。
      “代”，是广泛利用野生纤维，以及用旧棉、碎布等制成再生纤维，代替棉纱，加工成野生纤维布和再生布。全市仅采用代用品生产帐篷、盖布两项，一年即节约棉布一百多万米。
    “回收”，是由商业部门和有关工厂企业挂钩，大力回收包皮布、旧布和旧纱，分别处理，合理使用。如印刷厂每季有几万米沾满油墨的印刷用过的布，一些纺织厂、印染厂有残乱棉纱，商业部门就把这些旧布和纱回收起来，转给有关厂用来制做鞋底、车具绳索、网袋和鞋带。
    “修补”，是全市许多服装厂、生产合作社和街道工厂都接受大改小、旧翻新等缝补工作服、衣服的活计，并且充分利用碎布、杂布等下脚料，拼接缝制成书包、童装、儿童玩具、坐垫、小背心等各种各样的商品。这些产品成本低，花式美观大方，成为市场的畅销货。一年来，全市利用五十三万米下脚料做出了各种成品。
    “调剂”，是由商业部门经常翻阅销售棉布资料，到用布单位访问，对积压的多余物资进行调剂，互通有无。
    “租赁”，是专门成立的租赁机构，租借棉布给临时用布单位。例如北京市最近成立的这种机构，二十多天来已向三十多个工厂、企业、机关出租了三千多米棉布，解决了这些单位召开现场会议、举办展览会和包盖临时物资等的用布问题。
