The struggle of Black Americans against racial discrimination

Le Shan

A massive and magnificent movement of Black people against racial discrimination and persecution is unfolding across the United States, resounding with loud calls for equality and freedom. This struggle for racial equality erupted on February 1st. The specific goal of the Black people's struggle is to abolish the discriminatory system in restaurants and other public eating places in the American South that prohibits Black people from sitting down to eat, but its significance goes far beyond the narrow scope of fighting for a seat at a table, because it reflects the fact that American Black people have reached the limit of their tolerance for the reactionary system of racial discrimination.

This struggle began in Greensboro, North Carolina. It started with four Black students holding a "sit-in demonstration" in a restaurant. Their heroic actions immediately aroused the support of the broad masses of Black people in the American South. On February 25, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1,500 Black people held a demonstration. On March 2, more than 30 cities in the American South joined the struggle. In Nashville, Tennessee, the authorities dispatched a large number of police to suppress the protests, and more than 130 Black people were arrested. On the same day, in Washington, D.C., a large group of Black students held a demonstration outside the Senate. On March 6, in Montgomery, when two thousand Black people wanted to hold a rally against racial discrimination, the local authorities used force to stop them, arousing angry protests from the Black people. Now the struggle continues to spread to more places.

The American Declaration of Independence, which boasts that "all men are created equal" and "endowed with certain unalienable rights," was published more than 180 years ago, and Black people in the United States have been freed from slavery for nearly a century. However, to this day, the 18 million Black people, who account for about 11% of the total U.S. population, still suffer discrimination and persecution, and they still have to fight for basic democratic rights. This shows how hypocritical the so-called American "democratic system" that Eisenhower has recently been boasting about everywhere really is.

A Journey of Suffering

Although the racial discrimination and persecution of American racists are not limited to Black people, the discrimination and persecution suffered by Black people are the most serious. Under the slave system, Black people in the United States were commodities. Marx once pointed out that the American slave system was "a commercial system of exploitation." Black slaves were the property of slave owners and could be freely bought and sold by them. In order to fight for freedom, Black people waged a heroic and moving struggle, and uprisings were common. As a result of the Civil War, the slave system of arbitrary buying and selling of Black people was abolished, but the former slave owners were transformed into large landowners, and 90% of Black people became tenant farmers, who had to hand over 50% to 70% of their harvest to the landowners. A disguised form of feudal exploitation replaced the exploitation of the slave system. The broad masses of Black people were still in an extremely painful situation.

After the rapid development and concentration of American capitalism, monopoly capital carried out extra exploitation of Black workers in order to obtain super-profits. Black workers mostly engaged in heavy labor in the basic production sectors of American industry and were excluded from apprentice training. The average wage of Black workers was one-third lower than that of white workers. Black workers were often the first to be fired and the last to be hired. About three-quarters of Black families lived in "substandard" houses.

From slave to tenant farmer to exploited worker, this is the Black people's journey of suffering.

"White Supremacy"

In order to strengthen and deepen their control over American cultural life and social customs, maintain their reactionary rule, American monopoly capital and their agents not only tried their best to condone and shield the notorious Ku Klux Klan's "white supremacy" theory, but sometimes they did not hesitate to openly echo the Ku Klux Klan members or collude with them.

Harding, who served as President of the United States in the 1920s, once wore a Ku Klux Klan robe in a room in the White House to perform the ceremony of joining the Ku Klux Klan, and gave a U.S. Department of Defense license plate to the Ku Klux Klan "Grand Dragon," swearing to obey the "Grand Dragon's" orders. James Eastland, the current chairman of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, once publicly clamored in a speech in the Senate: "I believe in white supremacy, and as long as I stay in the Senate, I will fight for white supremacy."

It is worth noting that the Ku Klux Klan, which nominally stopped its activities, has now made a comeback and is becoming increasingly rampant. The Ku Klux Klan "Grand Dragon" of Georgia, Davidson, announced on January 7 that it would establish racially discriminatory schools in Atlanta. The "New York Times" revealed on February 23 that a secret fascist organization recently cracked down in Vienna has close ties with the American Ku Klux Klan. Many of the organization's propaganda materials were sent from the United States and were printed with the Ku Klux Klan logo.

"Unalienable Rights"

In order to maintain the fallacy of "white supremacy," maintain all-white state governments that are obedient to capitalists, and ensure the power of diehards in Congress, American racists have tried every means to deprive Black people of their right to vote. This situation is most serious in the southern states of the United States.

In many parts of the South, the price of Black people voting is still: "One vote, one life." In 1958, the official in charge of voter registration in Florida said to every Black person who applied for registration: "Okay! If you are not afraid of the consequences, then register!" In Miami, Florida, Ku Klux Klan members hung up Black people made of straw with a poster that read: "This Black person voted." Some states in the South also deliberately selected some bizarre questions to "test" Black people who applied for voter registration in order to determine whether they were eligible to vote. The American magazine "Collier's" reported that one of the questions asked by Florida registration officials was "How many windows are there in the White House?"

Under various discriminations, embarrassments, and obstructions, Black people in many parts of the United States are actually deprived of their right to vote. Mississippi has about one million Black people, nearly half of the state's total population, but only 20,000 of the 500,000 Black people of voting age are registered. Of the 650,000 Black people eligible to vote in Georgia, only 160,000 are registered. Of the 750,000 Black people in Virginia, only 60,000 are registered to vote.

With the arrival of the 1960 election year, some people who want to be president have put forward the issue of civil rights law in the Senate in order to win over the votes of Black people. Therefore, the issue of amending the civil rights law has become an important agenda item in Congress, and Eisenhower has also stated that "some important aspects" of the 1957 civil rights law "should be strengthened." However, die-hard Southern senators also resisted this pretense, and "filibustering" was their usual tactic. In Congress in Washington, Southern senators are performing a marathon speech farce to obstruct the vote on Black people's civil rights issues. Eighteen Southern senators took turns on stage, reading long articles from magazines, legal judgments, and committee reports day and night. Louisiana Senator Russell Long spoke continuously for nine hours and twenty-one minutes. Every once in a while, another Southern senator would ask him a question to give him a breather. As of March 3, the marathon speech had been going on for four days and four nights.

"All men are created equal?!"

In the United States, the laws of eleven states stipulate that Black people may not sit in the same buses and streetcars as white people. The laws of thirty states stipulate that Black people who marry white people are to be sentenced to five years in prison. Many places prohibit Black people from entering white people's hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, barber shops, toilets, hospitals, parks, and other public places. In the southern states, many restaurant seats are "for whites only." Black people are either made to stand while eating or are not served at all.

Although the U.S. Supreme Court "declared" in 1954 and 1955, based on the Constitution, that racial segregation in public schools "must be eliminated quickly," in the 1958-1959 school year, only 122,000 of the 2.8 million Black middle school students in the seventeen southern states and the capital, Washington, D.C., were studying in integrated schools, accounting for about 4% of the total. In some southern states, the gates of white schools are closed to Black people as they were in the past.

The most heinous thing is the lynching, shooting, castration, and beating of Black people by racists. According to statistics, from January 1955 to January 1959, there were as many as 530 cases of lynching, shooting, castration, explosions, and mob attacks on Black people in the southern United States that were reported in the press. A court in Alabama sentenced Black sharecropper Wilson to death for "stealing one dollar and ninety-five cents from a white woman." Black youth Foster of Montgomery was beaten to death by the police because he "insulted" a white woman on the phone.

The slogan "all men are created equal" in the Declaration of Independence has become a great irony of American reality.

The Struggle is in Full Swing

The oppressed Black people in the United States are increasingly aware that only by strengthening the struggle can they safeguard their democratic rights and give a strong blow to the system of racial discrimination. The current demonstrations held by Black Americans across the United States to protest the insulting treatment in restaurants are their new mobilization. This just struggle has not only won the support of the broad masses of Black people, but also the support of more and more upright white people. In fact, the struggle of Black people in the United States against racial discrimination and for equality has been combined with the common struggle of the American working class for democratic development, for peace, and against monopoly capital. As James Jackson, Secretary of Black Affairs and Southern Affairs of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, once pointed out: "The struggle of the Black people's tribal group in the United States for equal rights is an inseparable part of the democratic struggle of the exploited classes and oppressed people throughout the country and the world. Although the movement of the Black people in the United States has special characteristics, it is an inseparable part of the struggle of the American working people and the entire capitalist world for peace, security, democracy, and true freedom."

The wave of opposition to racial discrimination recently launched by Black people in the United States is in full swing and continues to expand. The American authorities are trying to stop the Black people's struggle by means of suppression and deception, but this is obviously impossible. Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, expressed the indomitable will of the Black people in the United States at a mass meeting. He said: "White people can be 'tough' or not 'tough,' it's up to them. But this will never affect the final result: the practice of racial segregation in public places must be abolished." Because Black people have "consciously and unanimously preferred to go to prison rather than submit to these old practices." Can the American authorities put more than ten million Black people in prison? The reactionary system of racial discrimination in the United States will inevitably be swept away by the ever-increasing wave of Black people's struggle. (Attached picture)

    美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争
    乐山
   一个声势浩大、波澜壮阔的黑人反对种族歧视和迫害的运动正在美国全境展开，到处响彻着要求平等自由的响亮呼声。这个争取种族平等的斗争是在2月1日爆发的。黑人进行斗争的具体目标是取消美国南部的饭店及其他公共饮食场所不许黑人坐着用膳的歧视制度，但是它的意义却远远超出争取坐下吃饭的这一狭隘的范围，因为它反映出了美国黑人对于反动的种族歧视制度已到了忍无可忍的地步了。
    这一次斗争开始于北卡罗来纳州格林斯博罗。开始是四个黑人学生在饭店里举行了“静坐示威”。他们的英勇行动，立即激起了美国南部广大黑人群众的支持。2月25日，在田纳西州的恰塔努加，一千五百名黑人举行了示威游行。3月2日，美国南部三十个以上的城市参加了斗争。在田纳西州的纳什维尔，当局出动大批警察进行镇压，被逮捕的黑人，连前共达一百三十多人。同日，在美国首都华盛顿，一大批黑人学生在参议院外面举行了示威。3月6日在蒙哥马利城，有两千黑人要举行集会反对种族歧视，地方当局竟以武力来阻止，引起了黑人们的愤怒抗议。现在这个斗争继续向更多的地方蔓延。
    标榜“人是生而平等的”、“天赋人权”的美国独立宣言，发表迄今已达一百八十多年，美国黑人摆脱奴隶地位也有将近一百年的历史，但是，到今天占美国人口总数约11％的一千八百万黑人还遭受着歧视和迫害，他们还要为争取基本的民主权利进行斗争。这说明了艾森豪威尔最近到处大事吹嘘的所谓美国“民主制度”是何等的虚伪。
    苦难的历程
    美国种族主义者的肤色歧视和种族迫害虽然并不仅限于黑人，但是黑人所遭受的歧视与迫害最为严重。在奴隶制度下，美国黑人是商品。马克思曾经指出，美国的奴隶制度是“一种商业的剥削制度”。黑奴是奴隶主的财产，可以由奴隶主自由买卖。黑人为了争取自由，进行了可歌可泣的斗争，起义事件屡见不鲜。南北战争的结果，废除了任意买卖黑人的奴隶制度，但是过去的奴隶主转变成为了大地主，90％的黑人变成了佃农，他们必须把收获的50％到70％交给地主。变相的封建剥削代替了奴隶制的剥削。广大的黑人仍旧处于极端痛苦的境地。
    美国资本主义迅速发展集中以后，垄断资本对黑人工人进行额外剥削以取得超额利润。黑人工人大都从事美国工业基本生产部门的繁重劳动，被排斥于学徒训练之外。黑人工人的平均工资比白人低三分之一。黑人工人往往最先被解雇、最后被雇用。黑人家庭约有四分之三住在“不合格”的房子里。
    从奴隶到佃农到被剥削的工人，这就是黑人的苦难的历程。
    “白人至上”
    美国垄断资本和他们的代理人，为了加强、加深对美国文化生活和社会习惯的控制，维持反动统治，不但对臭名昭著的三K党所鼓吹的“白人至上”论竭力纵容和包庇，他们有时竟不惜公开与三K党人一唱一和，或者同三K党人合流。
    在二十年代曾担任美国总统的哈定，曾在白宫的一所房间里穿着三K党人的长袍举行了加入三K党的仪式，并且把美国国防部的一块汽车牌照送给三K党“大龙头”，宣誓服从“大龙头”的命令。美国参议院国内安全小组委员会现任主席伊斯特兰，曾经在参议院的一次演说中公开叫嚷：“我信仰白人至上，只要我留在参议院，我就要为白人至上而斗争。”
    值得人们警惕的是，名义上停止活动的三K党，现在已经死灰复燃，而且日益猖獗。佐治亚州的三K党“大龙头”戴维逊于1月7日宣布，将在亚特兰大建立种族歧视的学校。“纽约时报”2月23日透露，最近在维也纳破获的一个秘密的法西斯组织与美国三K党有密切的联系。该组织的许多宣传品是由美国寄去的，印有三K党的标记。
    “天赋人权”
    为了维持“白人至上”的谬论、保持听命于资本家的清一色的白人州政府和保证顽固派在国会中的势力，美国种族主义者千方百计地剥夺了黑人的选举权。这个情况在美国南方各州最为严重。
    在南方许多地区，黑人投票的代价仍然是：
  “一张票，一条命”，1958年，佛罗里达州的负责选民登记事宜的官员，对每一名申请登记的黑人说：“好吧！如果你不害怕后果，你就进行登记吧！”在佛罗里达州的迈阿密，三K党人吊起了用稻草做的黑人，上面挂着一个招贴：“这个黑人投了票”。南方的一些州还故意选择了一些稀奇古怪的问题对申请选民登记的黑人进行“测验”，以决定他们是否有选举资格。美国“柯里尔”杂志报道，佛罗里达州登记官员提出的一个问题是“白宫有多少窗子？”
    在种种歧视、刁难和阻挠下，美国许多地方的黑人实际上被剥夺了选举权。密士失必州约有一百万名黑人，将近全州人口总数的一半，但是五十万名达到选举年龄的黑人，只有两万人进行了登记。佐治亚州六十五万名合于选举资格的黑人，只有十六万人进行了登记。弗吉尼亚州七十五万黑人中登记投票的只有六万人。
    随着1960年大选年的到来，一些想当总统的人为了拉拢黑人的选票，在参议院提出了民权法问题，于是修改民权法问题成了国会中的一项重要议程，艾森豪威尔也表示，1957年的民权法的“一些重要方面应当加强”。但是，南方的死硬派的参议员连这种假惺惺的举动也表示抵制，“拖延议事进程”就是他们所惯用的手段。在华盛顿的国会里，南方参议员正在表演马拉松讲演的丑剧，以阻挠对黑人民权问题的投票。十八名南方参议员轮流上台，夜以继日地宣读着杂志上的长篇文章、法律判决书、委员会的报告。路易斯安那州参议员鲁塞尔·朗，连续讲了九小时零二十一分钟。每隔一段时间，另一名南方参议员就向他提出一个问题，让他喘一口气。截至3月3日为止，马拉松讲演已经进行了四天四夜。
    “人是生而平等的”？！
    在美国，十一个州的法律规定，黑人不得同白人坐在同一辆公共汽车和电车里。三十个州的法律规定，与白人通婚的黑人要被判处五年的徒刑。许多地方禁止黑人进入白人的旅馆、餐厅、电影院、理发馆、厕所、医院、公园和其他公共场所。在南方各州，许多餐厅的座位都“只限白人用”。对于黑人，不是让他们站着用餐，就是根本不加招待。
    尽管1954年和1955年美国最高法院根据宪法“宣布”公立学校种族隔离现象“必须迅速消除”，可是在1958—1959学年，美国南方十七个州与首都华盛顿的二百八十万名黑人中学生，只有十二万二千名在混合的学校念书，为总数的4％左右。在南方的一些州，白人学校的大门像过去一样，对黑人是关闭着的。
    最令人发指的，是种族主义者对黑人所施行的私刑、枪杀、阉割、毒打。据统计，从1955年1月到1959年1月，在美国南部发生的私刑、枪杀、阉割、爆炸、聚众袭击黑人的案件，见诸报端的就达五百三十件之多。亚拉巴马州的法庭曾以“盗窃白人妇女一元九角五分钱”这样的罪名判处黑人雇农威尔逊以死刑。蒙哥马利城的黑人青年福斯特被警察活活地打死，因为他在电话里“污辱”了一个白种妇女。
    “人是生而平等的”这句独立宣言的口号，竟成了对美国现实生活的绝大讽刺。
     斗争方兴未艾
    美国被压迫的黑人已经愈来愈觉悟到，只有加强斗争才能够维护自己的民主权利，才能够给种族歧视制度以有力的打击。目前席卷美国各地的美国黑人抗议餐馆内侮辱性待遇而举行的示威斗争，正是他们的一次新的发动。这一次正义斗争不仅得到了广大黑人群众的支持，而且也得到越来越多的正直白人的支持。事实上美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取平等的斗争，已经和美国工人阶级争取民主发展、争取和平、反对垄断资本的共同斗争结合起来了。正如美共全国委员会黑人问题及南部事务书记詹姆斯·杰克逊曾经指出的：“美国黑人部族争取平权的斗争是全国和全世界被剥削阶级和被压迫人民民主斗争不可分割的一部分。美国黑人群众的运动虽然有特殊的性质，但它是美国劳动人民和整个资本主义世界争取和平、安全、民主和真正自由的斗争不可分割的部分。”
    美国黑人最近掀起的反对种族歧视的浪潮正在方兴未艾，继续扩大。美国当局企图用镇压和欺骗的手段来制止黑人的斗争，这显然是办不到的。美国全国有色人种协进会的执行秘书罗伊·威金斯在一次群众大会上说出了美国黑人不可屈服的斗争意志，他说：“白人‘强硬’也可以，不‘强硬’也可以，一切听他们的便。但是这决不会影响最后的结果：公共场合的种族隔离的做法都必须取消。”因为黑人已经“自觉地一致宁愿走进监狱也不愿屈从于这些老做法”了。难道美国当局能够把一千多万的黑人都关进监狱？美国反动的种族歧视制度必将被日益高涨的黑人斗争浪潮所冲垮。（附图片）
