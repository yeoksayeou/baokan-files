The Jinyin Brigade of the Luomen Commune is located in one of the driest mountainous areas of Wushan County, Gansu Province. During the spring planting period of 1959, there was no rain for more than forty consecutive days. Because the Jinyin Brigade implemented the policy of combining water storage, water diversion, and water lifting, and fully utilized the benefits of water conservancy, seeds were sown in a timely manner. Afterwards, they continued their efforts to overcome the severe drought in April and May, and therefore wrested an even greater harvest than in 1958 from the drought demon. The per-mu yield of more than 25,000 mu of grain crops in the entire brigade increased by 64% compared with 1958; more than 1,400 mu of oil crops increased by 32% compared with 1958.

Set Iron Will, Dig Out the Roots of Poverty

The Jinyin Brigade is located in the loess area, with very few trees, loose soil, crisscrossing gullies, and very serious soil erosion. In the early days of liberation, the grain yield per mu was only more than forty jin, and the average per person per year was more than two hundred jin. A ballad circulated among the masses: "Poor North Mountain, rich South Mountain, the suffering is unbearable in Hejia Mountain. Carrying water requires climbing over two mountains. Rice is hard to turn into noodles, and noodles are hard to turn into food."

As early as March 1957, the Wushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to completely change the backward economic situation in the Jinyin mountainous area, sent cadre Li Hua to Hejia Mountain to lead farmers in digging wells and cellars. Before communization, the entire brigade had dug 84 wells, 104 cellars, and 194 springs, completely solving the problem of drinking water for people and animals, and began to store and divert water to irrigate vegetable gardens and experimental fields. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the Jinyin Brigade developed irrigated land on a large scale to further solve the problem of irrigation water. On this basis, all the brigade members put forward the battle cry of "Setting an iron will, digging out the roots of poverty, fighting hard for three years, and catching up with 'Longquan' (Longquan is a rich team in the Luomen Commune)." The commune party committee transferred a group of capable cadres to this brigade to settle down and lead the members in harnessing mountains and rivers. Because the People's Commune exerted great power in transforming nature, and the masses exerted collective wisdom, by the end of last year, soil erosion had been basically controlled in the entire territory. Field projects such as cultivating field ridges, building dams, digging horizontal ditches, and repairing water scoops were carried out on more than 30,000 mu of land, and grass and trees were planted on barren mountains and gullies. With the support of other teams in the commune, a windbreak forest belt 30 li long and 4 meters wide was built on the North Mountain ridge, and countless fish-scale pits were dug in large and small gullies, and valley weirs were set up section by section at the bottom of the gullies, treating nearly 2,000 flood gullies. Last year, methods such as water returning to ponds, connecting ponds and dams, repairing canals for diversion and irrigation, rainwater returning to cellars, digging cellars in groups, using cellars to cover mu, drought-resistant point irrigation, groundwater coming out of wells, digging wells in series, and lifting water for irrigation were also adopted, so that irrigated land rapidly developed to 65% of the cultivated land area, reaching an average of 3.7 mu of irrigated land per person, guaranteeing a great agricultural harvest, and realizing the plan to catch up with the rich team Longquan in three years, two years ahead of schedule.

Combining Storage, Diversion and Lifting

In the process of changing the drought-stricken appearance, the Jinyin Brigade carried out mass movements and explored a set of successful experiences in using "three waters" (sky, surface, and groundwater) in a comprehensive way, adapting to local conditions, and realizing water conservancy in arid mountainous areas. Their method is: eyes down, grasping both large and small water sources, carrying out "sparrow warfare" everywhere, and storing, diverting, and lifting water blooming everywhere. The specific measures are:

(1) Repairing Canals for Diversion and Irrigation: That is, large water (gully water) is diverted for irrigation, small water is collected, and spring water is returned to ponds to build small mountain irrigation canals. The five mountain gullies with larger water sources in the entire brigade are diverted and irrigated using the "one gully, one canal" method. For the 43 mountain gullies with smaller water sources and intermittent flow in all seasons, dams are built at the bottom of the gullies to intercept and store water as soon as it appears on the ground, accumulating into a flow, installing sluice gates, and repairing canals for diversion and irrigation. Another method is to build large ponds with more abundant mountain springs, connecting ponds to accumulate into a flow, and repair canals for diversion and irrigation. By the end of last year, 39 such canals had been built, irrigating 5,800 mu of land.

(2) Storing Water for Diversion and Irrigation: That is, building dams at every gully, digging cellars at every bend, storing water everywhere, and covering mu for diversion and irrigation. In conjunction with the gully treatment project, more than 300 gullies without water sources in the entire brigade built a total of more than 500 small earth dams and valley weirs. In places where mountain bends accumulate floodwater, nearly 2,000 dry cellars were built using the method of "one cellar per mu," irrigating a total of about 10,000 mu of land.

(3) Intercepting Floods for Overflow Irrigation: In the summer and autumn seasons, when it is discovered that it is going to rain, preparations are made in advance, and flood irrigation is carried out on the land during rainy days. Production teams have designated specialists or experienced people to form groups to take charge of this work. More than 3,800 small ditches for flood irrigation were dug in more than 3,200 mu of land in the entire brigade, and all of them played a role last year.

(4) Lifting Water for Point Irrigation: On mountainous land where surface water is scarce but groundwater is abundant, well groups are laid out, ponds are built, and water is lifted for point irrigation or sprinkler irrigation. By the end of last year, 125 wells had been dug in Songjiapo, Hejiashan, and other places, and more than 1,000 ponds had been dug in the entire brigade, irrigating 3,400 mu of land.

(5) Carrying Ice and Accumulating Snow: In areas where there are no water conservancy facilities yet, the masses were mobilized to carry out winter ice and snow accumulation campaigns.

Drought-Resistant Planting Experiences Become a Set

In recent years, the Jinyin Brigade has explored rich drought-resistant and drought-fighting experiences by combining the method of learning from foreign experiences and promoting local experiences. In the case of long-term rainless conditions during the spring planting season the year before last, drought-resistant planting was implemented, and the severe drought during the wheat heading period in April and May was overcome, with remarkable results. Their drought-resistant methods are:

(1) Deep Plowing of Land: More than 17,000 mu of vacant land were generally deep plowed to a depth of 6 inches to 1 foot, deep plowed one to three times, changing the backward habit of not plowing the land before planting summer harvest crops, which played a great role in preserving moisture and resisting drought.

(2) Planting More Drought-Resistant Crops: In 1959, the production teams adopted the method of combining old farmers, technicians, and cadres to select 16 excellent varieties that are suitable for local planting from the 28 summer and autumn crop varieties grown locally. These varieties are drought-resistant and cold-resistant, have hard stalks and wind resistance, short maturity periods, high yields, and strong disease resistance. When sowing large autumn crops, a campaign of "one person, one and a half mu of drought-resistant, high-yielding fields" was launched, in which millet and foxtail millet were expanded by one to four times. In 1959, Songjiapo Production Team planted 982 mu of foxtail millet alone, expanding it four times. Each person had an average of one mu of foxtail millet, and the yield per mu increased by 70% compared with 1958, and 54% compared with general crops. With this one item alone, the entire brigade increased grain production by more than 350,000 jin.

(3) Wide and Narrow Row Planting: Seeds are sown on the edges of ditches and ridges, which is convenient for storing water, preserving moisture, and spot irrigation. When irrigating with canal water, it can save even more water.

(4) Triangular Nest Planting: This method is used when planting tall-stalk crops such as corn and sorghum on steeper slopes. Its advantages are that fertilizer is concentrated, which can preserve moisture and protect seedlings, and it is also convenient for point irrigation.

(5) Using Moisture to Preserve Planting: Wet soil is dug from ditches, spring sides, and pond sides, mixed with manure, and used for digging nests for point planting.

(6) Grass Fertilizer to Create Moisture: When sowing millet and other crops, it is during a drought. They use a large amount of green grass, cut into grass segments more than one inch long, and buried it in the plow trench ten days before planting. After rotting, it can be used as fertilizer and preserve moisture.

(7) Water Drill Planting: This drill sows seeds and sprinkles water at the same time, with good results.

(8) Advancing Winter Planting of Spring Crops: In 1959, three crops with long dormancy periods, namely spring wheat, foxtail millet, and millet, were selected for winter planting, totaling 2,400 mu. For general crops, early planting was also achieved half a month earlier to seize moisture.

(9) Mounding Foxtail Millet: According to experiments, mounding crops can preserve moisture and have strong drought resistance. Therefore, most autumn fields were hoeed twice more than in previous years, achieving three fertilizations, three hoeings, and one watering.

(10) Fertilizing According to Appetite: All of the more than 2,500 mu of grain fields were ranked. Each production team implemented rational fertilization according to the appetite of the land, adapting to local conditions. The drought resistance of crops was strengthened.

Great Battle Through Winter and Spring for a New Level

Since last winter, there has been little rain and snow in the Jinyin Brigade area. In order to prevent possible disasters, all the members have fully used last year's drought-resistant and production-increasing experience, resolutely implemented the provincial party committee's call for "increasing production without rain, and achieving great harvests in severe droughts," and are determined to further develop water conservancy on the existing basis, so that canals become networks, ponds and dams become groups, wells are connected in series, and cellars are connected to form reservoirs, so that water conservancy projects can better play their role. In order to complete this task, the party branches of each production team convened meetings of members to summarize the experience of harnessing mountains and rivers since the Great Leap Forward, and transferred more than 1,900 people to cooperate with each other, setting off a new upsurge in water conservancy construction. The four production teams of Yinjia Gou, Songjiapo, and others further developed ponds and dams in groups, canals into networks, and greatly stored gully water. The five production teams of Lianyi, Wangjiashan, and others focused on cellars, ponds, and springs, and greatly stored mountain water. Based on the spirit of repairing and irrigating at the same time, they adopted methods such as "white horse dividing mane" irrigation, self-flowing irrigation in the lower reaches, and artificial sprinkler irrigation. In more than a month, they have expanded irrigation by more than 2,200 mu. The water land of the entire brigade now accounts for 80% of the total cultivated land area, and more than 10,000 mu of cultivated land for spring planting this year has been fully irrigated.

    无雨大增产　大旱大丰收
    ——甘肃武山县洛门公社金银大队抗旱增产经验
    洛门公社金银大队，处在甘肃省武山县最干旱的一个山区。1959年春播期间，接连四十多天无雨。由于金银大队贯彻了蓄水、引水、提水并举的方针，全面发挥了水利效益，及时播下了种子。以后又再接再厉战胜了4、5月间的严重干旱，因此又从旱魔手里夺回了比1958年更大的丰收。全大队二万五千多亩粮食作物，亩产量比1958年增长64％；一千四百多亩油料作物，比1958年增长32％。
    立下钢铁志　挖掉穷白根
    金银大队处在黄土地带，树木极少，土质疏松，沟壑纵横，水土流失非常严重。在解放初期，粮食亩产只有四十多斤，每人每年平均二百多斤。群众中流传着一首歌谣：“穷北山，富南山，苦焦不过何家山，担水要翻两架山，有米难成面，有面难成饭”。
    早在1957年3月，中共武山县委为了彻底改变金银山区的经济落后面貌，就曾经派干部李华去何家山领导农民打井、打窖。到公社化前，全大队已打井八十四眼、打窖一百零四个、下泉一百九十四眼，完全解决了人畜饮水问题，并开始蓄水引灌，点浇菜园和试验田。人民公社建立后，金银大队就大规模地发展水浇地，进一步解决灌溉用水问题。在此基础上，全大队社员提出了“立下钢铁志，挖掉穷白根，苦战三年，赶上‘龙泉’（龙泉是洛门公社的富队）”的战斗口号。公社党委抽调了一批得力干部，下放到这个大队，安家落户，领导社员治山治水。由于人民公社在改造自然中发挥了巨大威力，群众发挥了集体智慧，截至去年底，全境已基本控制水土流失，在三万多亩土地上进行了培地埂、打坝堰、挖水平沟、修水簸箕等田间工程，又在荒山荒沟种草种树。在公社其他队支援下，还在北山梁上营造了一条长达三十里、宽四米的防风林带，大沟小沟又挖了无数鱼鳞坑，沟底节节设置了谷坊，治了近两千条洪沟。去年还采用水归塘、塘坝相连、修渠引灌、雨水归窖、打窖成群、以窖包亩、抗旱点浇、地下水出井、打井成串、提水浇灌等办法，使水浇地迅速发展到占耕地面积的65％，达到每人平均有水浇地三亩七分，保证了农业大丰收，使三年赶上富队——龙泉队的规划，提前两年实现。
    蓄引提并举
    金银大队在改变干旱面貌中，大搞群众运动，摸索到了“三水”（天上、地面、地下水）并用，因地制宜，在干旱山区实现水利化的一套成功经验。他们的办法是：眼睛向下，大小水齐抓，处处开展“麻雀战”，蓄、引、提遍地开花。具体措施是：
    （1）修渠引灌：即大水（沟水）引灌，小水集流，泉水归塘，修筑山地小型灌溉渠道。全大队五条水源较大的山沟，以“一沟一渠”的办法，进行引灌。有四十三条水源较小，四季不经常流水的山沟，水一露出地面，就在沟底打坝拦蓄，节节蓄水，汇集成流，安设水闸，修渠引灌。另一种是水较充足的山泉，修筑大塘，塘塘相连，汇集成流，修渠引灌。到去年底已经修筑上述三类渠道三十九条，灌地五千八百亩。
    （2）蓄水引灌：即逢沟筑坝，遇弯打窖，处处蓄水，包亩引灌。全大队三百多条无水源的山沟，结合治沟工程，共打小型土坝和谷坊五百多座。在山弯洪水聚集的地方，以“一亩一窖”的办法，打旱窖近二千个，共浇灌土地约一万亩。
      （3）拦洪漫灌：在夏秋两季，发现天要下雨，就事先作好准备，雨天突击引洪漫地。生产队都确定有专人或有经验的人，组成小组，担任这项工作。全大队三千二百多亩土地，开挖引洪灌溉小渠三千八百多条，去年全部发挥了效益。
      （4）提水点浇：在地面水缺乏而地下水较多的山地上，布设井群，修挖涝池，提水点浇或喷灌。到去年底已在宋家坡、何家山等地打井一百二十五眼，全大队挖涝池一千多个，浇地三千四百亩。
    （5）背冰积雪：在尚无水利设施的土地，大力发动群众，开展了冬季背冰积雪运动。
        抗旱播种经验成套
    几年来，金银大队运用学习外地经验和推广本地经验相结合的办法，摸索出了丰富的防旱抗旱经验。在前年春播时长期不雨的情况下，实行抗旱播种，4、5月间，麦子抽穗期又战胜了严重干旱，效果显著。他们的抗旱办法是：
      （1）深翻土地：一万七千多亩空闲地普遍深翻六寸到一尺，深翻一至三遍，改变了夏收作物种前不翻地的落后习惯，对保墒抗旱起了很大的作用。
      （2）多种抗旱作物：1959年各生产队采取老农、技术员、干部三结合的办法，从当地种的二十八种夏、秋作物品种中，选出了适合当地种植的十六种耐旱抗寒、秆硬抗风、成熟期短、产量高、抗病性强的优良品种，大力进行推广。播种大秋作物时，开展了“一人一亩半抗旱高产田”运动，其中糜子和谷子扩大一至四倍。1959年宋家坡生产队仅谷子就种了九百八十二亩，扩大四倍，每人平均有一亩谷子，亩产比1958年增产70％，比一般作物增产54％。只此一项，全大队就增产粮食三十五万多斤。
    （3）宽窄行播种：将种籽播在沟垅边，便于蓄水保墒和点浇灌溉。如用渠水引灌时，更能节约用水。
    （4）三角形窝种：在坡度较陡的土地上，种玉米、高粱等高秆作物时，采用这种办法。它的优点是施肥集中，能保墒、保苗，也便于点浇。
      （5）借墒保种：从沟里、泉边、涝池边挖来湿土，同粪土搅和，进行挖窝点种。
      （6）草肥造墒：播种糜谷等庄稼时，正值天旱。他们用大量青草，铡成一寸多长的草节，种前十天埋在犁沟内，腐烂后既能当肥料，又能保墒。
      （7）水耧下种：这种耧一边播籽、一边洒水，效果良好。
    （8）春播作物提前冬播：1959年选择了春小麦、谷子、糜子等三种休眠期长的作物，实行冬播，共种二千四百亩。在一般作物上，也作到了提前半个月抢墒早种。
    （9）谷子壅堆：根据试验，壅堆作物能保墒，抗旱能力强，因此大部分秋田比往年多锄草两遍，达到了三肥、三锄、一水。
      （10）按胃口施肥：将二千五百多亩粮田，全部进行排队。各生产队因地制宜，实行了按土地胃口合理施肥。加强了作物抗旱能力。
    大战一冬春更上一层楼
    去冬以来，金银大队附近一带雨雪稀少。为了预防可能发生的灾情，全体社员充分运用去年抗旱增产经验，坚决执行省委提出的“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”的号召，决心在原有的基础上，进一步大搞水利，使渠道成网，塘坝成群，连井成串，连窖成库，使水利工程更好地发挥效益。为了完成这一任务，各生产队党支部，都召开了社员大会，总结了大跃进以来治山治水的经验，抽调了一千九百多人，队队协作，掀起了新的兴修水利高潮。尹家沟、宋家坡等四个生产队，进一步大闹塘坝成群，渠道成网，大蓄沟水。联谊、王家山等五个生产队，以窖、池、泉为主，大蓄山上水。他们本着边修边灌的精神，采取“白马分鬃”引灌、在下自流灌溉、人工喷灌等办法，一个多月来，已经扩大灌溉了二千二百多亩地。全大队的水地，已占全部耕地面积的80％，今年春播的一万多亩耕地，已经全部灌上了水。
