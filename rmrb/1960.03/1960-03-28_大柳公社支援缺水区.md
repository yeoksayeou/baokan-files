    Daliu Commune Supports Water-Scarce Areas

    The Daliu Commune in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, actively digs wells and springs, and draws underground water, letting the river water within the commune's boundaries be used for irrigation by other communes.

    In the struggle against drought, in order to support communes lacking water sources, the entire commune launched a high tide of well and spring digging. Wang Songshan, the captain of the Shaofang Production Team, said: "We must treat the affairs of fraternal communes as our own, actively dig wells and springs, and support fraternal communes." After two months of effort, the entire commune successfully dug a new batch of water wells and built new canals. With the exception of a small portion of high-lying fields that still need river water for irrigation, the remaining fields are all irrigated with underground water. The surplus river water is entirely given to the Gaoba Commune, the Xiashuang Commune, and the communes of Minqin County.

    大柳公社支援缺水区
    甘肃省武威县大柳公社，积极打井挖泉提引地下水，把本社范围内的河水让给其它公社灌溉。
    这个公社在抗旱斗争中，为了支援缺乏水源的公社，全社开展起了打井挖泉的高潮，烧坊生产队队长王松山说：“我们一定把兄弟社的事当做自己的事一样，积极打井挖泉，支援兄弟社。”全社经过两个月的努力，新打成一批水井，新修了渠道，全社除一小部分地势较高的田地还需要河水灌溉外，其余的田地都用地下水灌溉，节余下来的河水，全部让给了高坝公社、下双公社和民勤县的公社。
