Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 11th: Over eight thousand returned overseas Chinese workers, who have been placed in factories and mines in Fujian over the past ten years, have promoted the fine tradition of loving the motherland and actively participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. Many have been recognized as advanced producers and activists in socialist construction.

After returning to the motherland, the vast number of returned overseas Chinese workers have received deep care from the Party and the state. Based on the needs of the country and their own wishes, they have been assigned appropriate jobs, allowing their skills to be fully utilized. Through the education and cultivation of the Party and the mutual assistance of fellow factory workers, they have continuously progressed and improved. When returned overseas Chinese worker Yao Minlun came to Fujian Machine Factory in 1955, he could not understand blueprints and often produced defective products. The factory leaders and veteran workers enthusiastically encouraged and helped him, enabling him to go from not understanding to understanding, and quickly become a technical innovation expert. The youth shock brigade he led successfully trial-produced a thread rolling machine when producing screws, increasing production efficiency by twenty times. Since 1958, Yao Minlun has received ten certificates of merit, medals, and material rewards from the Fuzhou Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and the factory. Returned overseas Chinese worker Xiao Chunfa, when he first came to work at Zhangzhou Chemical Plant, lacked chemical knowledge because he was originally a shop assistant. The factory sent him to Shanghai to study. In just over a year, he learned to repair equipment such as acid pumps, converters, and absorption towers, and independently solve technical problems in production. Last year, he was named an advanced producer of the plant three times, and was awarded the honorary title of "Seven Good" Youth of Zhangzhou and National Red Flag Shock Worker by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

Under the education of the Party, the socialist consciousness of returned overseas Chinese workers has continuously improved, and they have demonstrated the spirit of being masters of their own affairs in production. In August last year, when a strong typhoon of level 12 or above hit Xiamen, Cai Shizhi, a returned overseas Chinese worker at Qiaoxing Chemical Plant, woke up his roommates Wang Zhongying and You Naijian in the middle of the night in order to prevent state property from being damaged. They braved the strong typhoon and walked more than two miles to the factory to rescue materials, fighting until dawn. After all the materials were rescued to a safe place, they braved the wind and rain to lead the masses in repairing the factory buildings and cleaning the workshops, enabling the factory to quickly resume production and realize the original Great Leap Forward plan. When Deng Yazhao, a returned overseas Chinese worker who worked as a technician, first came to the newly built Xianyou Sugar Factory, he led four temporary workers and three apprentices to overcome difficulties such as insufficient equipment. He created his own tools, designed blueprints, and successively created hundreds of tools of various sizes and specifications, such as soup spoons and half-round files. This not only saved the country money, but also ensured that the wood mold group over-fulfilled the state plan month after month and quarter after quarter, and was honorably elected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Heroes.

After returning to China to work and produce, overseas Chinese workers have lived a happy life. The Lu Yuanliang family lived a difficult life abroad. After returning to China in 1957, three people obtained suitable jobs, and now the whole family lives a stable life without worrying about food and clothing. Lu Yuanliang, who works as a driver at Xiamen Transport Company, has been praised and rewarded by the transport company three times for his active work.

    祖国到处有用武之地
    福建归侨职工涌现大批先进生产者
    新华社福州11日电　十年来被安置在福建工矿企业的八千多名归国华侨职工，发扬了热爱祖国的优良传统，积极参加祖国社会主义建设，许多人被评为先进生产者和社会主义建设积极分子。
    广大归侨职工回到祖国后，受到党和国家的深切关怀，根据国家需要和他们的志愿，安排了适当的工作，使他们的技能得到充分发挥，在党的教育培养和同厂职工互相帮助下，不断进步提高。归侨工人姚敏伦在1955年来到福建机器厂时，看不懂图纸，常出废品，工厂领导和老工人们便热情地鼓励和帮助他，使他从不懂到懂，迅速成为一个技术革新的能手，他领导的一支青年突击队，在生产螺丝钉时，试制成功搓丝机，使生产效率提高二十倍。从1958年以来，姚敏伦先后获得福州市人民委员会、市总工会、市团委、全国侨联和工厂授予的十次奖状、奖章以及物质奖励。归侨萧春发，刚来漳州化工厂工作时因为他原来是店员，缺乏化工知识，厂里就派他到上海去学习，仅一年多时间就会修理酸泵、转化器、吸收塔等设备和独立解决生产中的技术问题。去年一年，他三次被评为全厂先进生产者，并且荣获漳州“七好”青年和共青团中央授予的全国红旗突击手的光荣称号。
    在党的教育下，归侨职工们社会主义觉悟不断提高，在生产中发挥了当家作主的精神。去年8月间，十二级以上的强台风侵袭厦门时，侨星化工厂归侨职工蔡时志为了不使国家财产遭受损失，半夜叫醒同宿舍的王仲英、游乃拣，冒着强台风走了二里多路，赶到工厂抢救物资，一直奋战到天亮。等全部物资抢救到安全地带以后，他们又冒着风雨带动群众抢修厂房和清理车间，使工厂能迅速恢复生产，实现原订大跃进计划。作技工的归侨邓亚朝刚到新建成仙游糖厂工作时，带领四个临时工和三个徒工，克服设备不足等困难，自己创制工具，设计图纸，先后创造汤钥、半圆锉等大小规格不等的工具上百件，不光是节省了国家开支，还保证木模小组连续四年月月超额完成国家计划，季季评上先进单位，光荣地当选为出席全国群英会的代表。
    华侨职工回国参加工作和生产以后，都过着幸福生活。归侨卢元良一家在国外时生活很困难，1957年回国后，三个人得到了适当的工作，现在全家过着不愁吃穿的安定生活。在厦门市运输公司当驾驶员的卢元良，因为工作积极，还先后三次受到运输公司的表扬和奖励。
