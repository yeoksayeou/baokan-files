Worthless “Civil Rights” Bill
Leshan

It is said that Eisenhower took more vacations than any previous U.S. president, averaging seventy-three days a year since taking office in 1953, not counting sick leave. During his vacations, he was always leisurely, wandering around. Gettysburg Farm, Newport in Rhode Island, Denver in Colorado, Augusta in Georgia, and Palm Springs in California are all well-known places where Eisenhower enjoyed himself. However, the presidential hunting grounds located in the “Black Belt” of the southern United States have rarely attracted attention until recently.

The so-called “Black Belt” includes a large area stretching from Virginia in the east to eastern Texas in the west. North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are all included. Baker County, in the southwestern corner of Georgia, is a typical area of ​​the “Black Belt.” Most of the land in Baker County is divided among three capitalist plantations. One is Richard Mellon from New York, one is Hill Blackett, an advertising capitalist from Chicago, and the other is Woodruff, the chairman of the board of Coca-Cola. A large piece of land owned by Woodruff is a great place for hunting quail. This is the hunting ground that Eisenhower frequents. He gains a lot every time he comes here to hunt.

The previously unknown presidential hunting ground, Baker County, suddenly appeared prominently in the March 20th issue of the "New York Times," which is an episode in the farcical "civil rights" bill debate being staged in the U.S. Congress.

In order to win votes for itself in this election year, the U.S. Republican government has submitted a bill to Congress to “protect” the civil rights of black people. The bill stipulates that the U.S. Federal Court has the power to appoint "referees" to "protect" the rights of black citizens who have been deprived of their voting rights by local authorities. Some Democratic senators, mainly those representing the northern states, are unwilling to let the Republican Party monopolize this banner that can win some votes in the election year, and are also enthusiastic about the "civil rights" bill.

In fact, the "civil rights" bill is not a new trick played by American politicians.

The Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution stipulates: “1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”

This amendment was passed by the U.S. Congress on March 30, 1870. However, American racists immediately adopted various methods to invalidate this provision. And American politicians have repeatedly used this clause to propose so-called "civil rights" bills to win over the people and win votes. The Eisenhower government made a big splash in 1957 with the so-called "Civil Rights Act of 1957," which stipulated that when black people's right to vote is violated, federal judges should conduct trials. However, the Senate passed an amendment proposed by several Southern senators, stipulating that black people's election cases should be tried by a jury. In the South, however, juries are composed entirely of white people. As a result, the "Civil Rights Act" of 1957 was actually completely invalidated. Eisenhower himself also publicly admitted that "some important aspects" of the "Civil Rights Act" of 1957 "should be strengthened."

Because the "Civil Rights Act" of 1957 was discredited, this time the bill had to come up with more deceptive tricks. The new bill stipulates that federal judges will appoint federal personnel (called referees) to supervise registration, voting, and vote counting in areas that have consistently discriminated against black people.

As usual, the American bourgeois press wants to promote and introduce the new "civil rights" bill. The "New York Times" reporter also took a trip to Baker County, the president's hunting ground, and conducted a survey of the black people who account for more than half of the total population of Baker County, but unexpectedly found that the residents of Baker County reacted extremely coldly to the so-called "civil rights" bill and "referees."

The "New York Times" reporter helplessly acknowledged the following facts:

In the president’s hunting area, no black person has registered to vote. Because countless lessons have taught them to be terrified. Black carpenter Phillips explained why he did not dare to register, saying: “I want to maintain my life, and I don’t want my wife and I to be fired.” One black person said: “I don’t want to be killed.” Another black person said that black people voting in Baker County is like robbing a bank. Their concerns are not without basis. After the implementation of the "Civil Rights Act" of 1957, four black people in Baker County risked registering to vote, and they were subjected to all kinds of harassment by registration officials. The final result was: one black person's house was blown up, two black people's cars were damaged, and the fourth black person was framed and imprisoned.

Baker County Sheriff Warren Johnson made no secret of his firm opposition to the "civil rights" bill. He said: It is unwise to let black people vote, "Many black people are willing to be black, which is exactly what we want." He also said: "If you sprinkle sand on the two most docile dogs, they will fight. I hope Congress will not sprinkle sand on the people of our Baker County." The black people of Baker County pointed out that Warren Johnson had brutally killed a young black man for no reason.

Eisenhower has been to Baker County many times to hunt quail. Of course, it is impossible for him to know nothing about the situation in Baker County. However, at a press conference on March 16, he feigned ignorance of the facts of discrimination and persecution of black people in the United States. He said: "I certainly don't have enough legal knowledge or enough wisdom to know when a problem will actually violate the constitutional rights of black people in this regard." "I can't, I will never talk more, I don't know." Eisenhower particularly emphasized that "we are trying to submit a civil rights bill to Congress for discussion and passage."

Now, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the so-called "civil rights" bill on March 24 and submitted it to the Senate. Due to the marathon speaking tactics of "delaying the proceedings" used by some Southern senators, the Senate has been in a stalemate on its own "civil rights" bill for more than five weeks. Now some Southern senators are gearing up to launch a tenacious battle against the bill proposed by the House of Representatives.

However, the American people have long seen through the deceptiveness of the "civil rights" bill. The American "Workers Weekly" pointed out that "this new bill puts the responsibility (of protecting black people's right to vote) on the federal courts. But since the Supreme Court made a ruling against racial segregation six years ago, the federal courts have not been able to get any black children to attend school with white children in the five 'die-hard Southern' states..." The "People's World" also pointed out that this bill "will certainly involve black people in protracted and expensive litigation rather than giving them the right to vote. And long-term judicial interrogation will make black people give up the idea of exercising their rights."

The indifference of the black people in the president’s hunting ground to the new "civil rights" bill shows that American politicians are becoming less and less attractive in playing the trick of "civil rights" bills. No trick can ease the struggle against racial discrimination that American black people are launching. Because the black people in the United States are not as easily deceived as the quail in the president's hunting ground. (Attached picture)

In the southern United States, racists hung a scarecrow on a utility pole with the words "This black person voted" written on its back to intimidate black people demanding the right to vote.

    不值钱的“民权”法案
    乐山
    据说艾森豪威尔休假之多是打破历届美国总统纪录的，他从1953年就任以来，平均每年休假七十三天，病假还不在此列。他在休假期间，总是优哉悠哉，到处游逛。葛底斯堡农场、罗得岛的新港、科罗拉多州的丹佛、佐治亚州的奥古斯大、加利福尼亚州的棕榈泉，都是人所共知的艾森豪威尔游乐之地。可是位于美国南部“黑人地带”的总统狩猎场，直到最近以前却很少引起人们的注意。
    所谓“黑人地带”包括东起弗吉尼亚州、西迄得克萨斯州东部的大片地方。北卡罗来纳、南卡罗来纳、佐治亚、亚拉巴马、密士失比各州均包括在内。佐治亚州西南角的贝克郡，是“黑人地带”的一个典型的地区。贝克郡大部分土地为三个资本家的种植园所分割。一个是纽约的理查·梅隆，一个是芝加哥的广告业资本家希尔·布拉克特，另一个就是可口可乐公司董事会主席伍德鲁弗。伍德鲁弗所占有的一大片土地是猎取鹌鹑的胜地。这里就是艾森豪威尔不时光临的狩猎场。他每次到这里来行猎都大有所获。
    向来默默无闻的总统狩猎场——贝克郡，突然出现于3月20日“纽约时报”的重要地位上，这是美国国会正在有声有色地上演的“民权”法案大辩论丑剧中的一段插曲。
    美国共和党政府为了在今年这一个选举年替自己骗取选票，向国会提出了“保护”黑人民权的法案，法案规定美国联邦法院有权指派“仲裁人”来“保护”被地方当局剥夺了选举权的黑人公民权利。某些民主党参议员，主要是代表北部各州的议员，不甘心在选举年让共和党独占这面能够骗取一些选票的旗帜，也对“民权”法案表示热心。
    其实，“民权”法案并不是美国政客耍弄的新玩意。
    美国宪法第十五补充条款规定：“一、美国或任何一州不得因种族、肤色或过去的奴隶情况剥夺或拒绝美国公民的投票权利。二、国会有权凭适当的立法来实施本条款。”
    1870年3月30日，这项补充条款在美国国会通过。但是美国的种族主义者立即采取各种办法，使这项规定归于无效。而美国政客也就屡次利用这个条款提出所谓“民权”法案，以笼络人心、骗取选票。艾森豪威尔政府于1957年大吹大擂地提出了所谓“1957年民权法案”，规定当黑人选举权遭受侵害时，得由联邦法官进行审理。但是参议院却通过了南方若干参议员提出的一项修正案，有关黑人选举案件由陪审团进行审理。而在南方，陪审团是由清一色的白人组成的。于是，1957年的“民权”法案实际上完全归于无效。艾森豪威尔自己也曾公开承认，1957年的“民权”法案的“一些重要方面应当加强”。
    由于1957年的“民权”法案声誉扫地，这一次的法案不得不提出更富有欺骗性的花招。新法案规定，联邦法官将指定联邦人员（称为仲裁人）到那些一贯歧视黑人的地区去监督登记、投票和计票。
    美国资产阶级报纸对新的“民权”法案，照例是要吹捧、介绍一番的。“纽约时报”的记者还到总统的狩猎地贝克郡走了一趟，向贝克郡占居民总数一半以上的黑人作了一番调查，不料发现贝克郡的居民对所谓“民权”法案、“仲裁人”的反应极为冷淡。
    “纽约时报”记者无可奈何地承认了这样的事实：
    在总统的狩猎区，没有一名黑人进行了选举登记。因为无数的事实教训使他们谈虎色变。黑人木工菲利普斯解释他不敢进行登记的原因说：“我要维持生活，我不愿意我和我的妻子都被辞退。”有一个黑人说：“我不希望惨遭杀害。”另一个黑人说，黑人在贝克郡投票，等于抢劫了一家银行。他们这种担心并不是没有根据的。1957年的“民权”法案实施以后，贝克郡有四名黑人冒险进行了投票登记，他们受到登记官员百般的刁难。最后的结果是：一名黑人的住宅被炸毁了，两名黑人的汽车被人破坏了，第四名黑人被人诬陷，关进了监狱。
    贝克郡的郡长华伦·约翰生毫不隐讳他是坚决反对“民权”法案的。他说：让黑人去投票是不聪明的，“有许多黑人甘心当黑人，这正是我们所希望的。”他又说：“如果你向两头性情最善良的狗的身上撒砂子，它们就会打起来。我希望国会不要向我们贝克郡的人撒砂子。”贝克郡的黑人指出，华伦·约翰生曾经平白无故地惨杀了一名黑人青年。
    艾森豪威尔到贝克郡去猎鹌鹑已经多次了。当然，他不可能对贝克郡的情况一无所知。但是，在3月16日的记者招待会上，他却对美国歧视和迫害黑人的事实装聋作痴。他说：“我在这方面当然没有足够的法律知识或是足够的智慧能够知道一个问题什么时候会实际破坏黑人的宪法权利。”“我不能，我决不会多谈，我不知道。”艾森豪威尔特别强调“我们正在设法把一项民权法案提交国会讨论，由国会通过。”
    现在，美国众议院已于3月24日通过了所谓“民权”法案，并且把它提交参议院。而由于一些南方参议员利用了“拖延议事进程”的马拉松讲演战术，参议院在它自己的“民权”法案上处于僵持局面已经五个多星期了。现在一些南方参议员正在磨拳擦掌，准备发动一次顽强的战斗来反对众议院提出的法案。
    但是，美国人民早已识破了“民权”法案的欺骗性。美国“工人周报”指出，“这个新法案把（保护黑人选举权的）责任推在联邦法院身上。但是自从最高法院六年前作出关于反对种族隔离的裁决以来，联邦法院在五个‘死硬的南部’州中，没有能够使任何一个黑人儿童和白种儿童同校读书……”。“人民世界报”也指出，这个法案“与其说会使黑人得到选票，不如说它必定会使黑人卷入旷日持久的费用巨大的诉讼中去。而长时期的司法审问将使黑人放弃要行使他们的权利的念头。”
    在总统狩猎场里的黑人对新“民权”法案的冷淡，说明美国政客在玩弄“民权”法案的把戏上，越来越缺乏吸引力。任何花招都无法缓和美国黑人正在展开的反对种族歧视的斗争。因为美国的黑人并不像总统狩猎场中的鹌鹑那样容易受骗的。（附图片）
    在美国南部，种族主义分子在电线杆上吊起一个稻草人，背上写着“这个黑人投票了”，借此恫吓要求取得选举权的黑人。
