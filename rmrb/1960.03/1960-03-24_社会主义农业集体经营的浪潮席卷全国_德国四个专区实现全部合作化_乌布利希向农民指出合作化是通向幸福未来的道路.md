Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 22nd. A massive wave of agricultural cooperativization is sweeping across the German Democratic Republic. Since the beginning of March, four of the fourteen districts in the country have successively achieved complete cooperativization. Currently, the high tide of agricultural cooperativization is expanding to other regions.

On March 5th, the Rostock District on the Baltic coast became the first district in the country to achieve complete cooperativization. On March 15th, the Neubrandenburg District, the largest agricultural district in the country, announced in a letter to the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany that 100% of the district's farmers had joined agricultural production cooperatives. Subsequently, the third and fourth districts to fully realize agricultural cooperativization emerged: the Frankfurt District on the Oder River and the Potsdam District. In the Halle, Leipzig, Cottbus and other districts in the central part of the Republic, a high tide of cooperativization is emerging.

The new high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement began last winter. On December 12th of last year, the first completely cooperativized county in the country, the Eilenburg County, appeared in the Leipzig District. At the same time, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany convened its Seventh Central Plenary Session, which put forward calls to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural cooperativization movement and increase the production of agricultural commodities. Under this call, the Party committees of various districts held special meetings to discuss the situation in their respective districts and strengthened the leadership of the cooperativization movement, which greatly promoted the rapid and healthy development of agricultural cooperativization. In February alone, 709 new agricultural production cooperatives were established nationwide.

The recent rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the German Democratic Republic is also inseparable from the strengthening of political and ideological work by the Party and state organs and the vigorous development of propaganda and education campaigns. For example, in Eilenburg County, a propaganda team of nearly a thousand people was organized, and in Rostock District, a propaganda team of two thousand five hundred people was organized. The propagandists went deep into the countryside to publicize the Party's policies to the peasants and explain the superiority of cooperativization. Cadres, while working together with the peasants, better understood the problems of the peasants and helped them solve them. Many places also organized individual farmers to visit agricultural production cooperatives established earlier.

The agricultural cooperativization movement in the German Democratic Republic is developing under the sharp struggle against reactionary propaganda from West Germany and West Berlin. Recently, the reactionary propaganda machines of West Germany and West Berlin, especially the "RIAS" radio station in the American sector of West Berlin, have continuously slandered and fabricated rumors about the agricultural cooperativization movement in the German Democratic Republic. The newspapers and periodicals of the German Democratic Republic have given a firm response to these reactionary propagandas, and the joining of cooperatives by a large number of individual farmers is the best answer to West Germany's reactionary propaganda.

The cooperativized countryside now presents a new atmosphere everywhere. Many newly established cooperatives have discussed this year's production plans and are busy preparing for spring planting. The old cooperatives are studying how to expand their operations after adding new members. Local Party committees and government organs are also transferring and training cadres to help cooperatives improve their organization and carry out production work.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 22nd. Newspapers here today published a letter from Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to the nation's farmers, warmly congratulating the farmers of the four fully cooperativized districts that have recently emerged in succession.

In his letter, Ulbricht pointed out that the glorious banner of socialism now flies over the four already fully cooperativized districts—Rostock, Neubrandenburg, Frankfurt, and Potsdam—pointing out to men and women farmers, especially young people in the countryside, the road to a happy future. These four districts, which used to be among the most backward agricultural areas in Germany, are now becoming modern industrial and agricultural areas.

Ulbricht said that the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the past few weeks is mainly due to the fact that most farmers understand that only through cooperativization can further major development of agriculture be achieved. He pointed out that agricultural cooperativization also creates conditions for the final elimination of feudal and fascist remnants of influence.

Ulbricht pointed out in his letter that agricultural cooperatives have made important contributions to enhancing the strength of the German Democratic Republic and making it more attractive to the people of West Germany. The urgent task now is to expand and consolidate cooperatives and develop them into exemplary socialist production units.

Ulbricht continued, saying that many new problems have emerged in the development and organization work of the fully cooperativized villages, and these problems can be well solved after consultation with all cooperative members. New agricultural production cooperatives should study the production methods of those agricultural production cooperatives that were established earlier and have achieved results, and experienced cooperative members should help the new cooperatives.

Ulbricht said that the main task now is to speed up spring planting. Before spring planting, all possibilities should be used to merge small plots of land. Tractors and agricultural machinery must be utilized to the maximum extent. In villages where there are still some individual farmers, machine tractor stations, agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers should work together to complete the spring planting work as soon as possible.

Ulbricht expressed his belief that individual farmers who still want to work in the old way will gradually accept the cooperative labor method.

Ulbricht called on Party organizations, mass organizations, the National Front, and government agencies in rural areas to focus their attention on agricultural production. He also called on experienced cooperative members and agricultural experts to participate in socialist labor collectives in order to jointly complete all agricultural tasks.

### 社会主义农业集体经营的浪潮席卷全国  德国四个专区实现全部合作化  乌布利希向农民指出合作化是通向幸福未来的道路

    社会主义农业集体经营的浪潮席卷全国
    德国四个专区实现全部合作化
    乌布利希向农民指出合作化是通向幸福未来的道路
    新华社柏林22日电　在德意志民主共和国，一个声势浩大的农业合作化运动浪潮正在席卷全国。今年3月初以来，全国十四个专区中已有四个专区先后实现全部合作化，现在，农业合作化的高潮正在扩及其他地区。
    本月5日，波罗的海沿岸的罗斯托克专区成为全国第一个全部合作化的专区。3月15日，全国最大的农业专区——新勃兰登堡专区在向德国统一社会党中央报捷的信中宣布，这个专区的农户百分之百地加入了农业生产合作社。接着，第三个和第四个全部实现农业合作化的专区又出现了，它们是奥得河畔的法兰克福专区以及波茨坦专区。在共和国中部的哈雷、来比锡、科特布斯等专区，合作化运动的高潮正在出现。
    农业合作化运动的新高潮是在去年冬季开始的。去年12月12日，在来比锡专区出现了全国第一个全部合作化的县份——埃伦伯格县。与此同时，德国统一社会党召开了第七次中央全会，提出了加强对农业合作化运动的领导，增加农业商品生产等号召。在这个号召下，各个专区的党委都专门开会讨论了本区的情况，加强了对合作化运动的领导，这就大大推动了农业合作化运动迅速和健康的发展。仅在今年2月份，全国就新成立了七百零九个农业生产合作社。
    德意志民主共和国农业合作化运动最近的迅速发展，又是和党及国家机关加强政治思想工作、大力开展宣传教育运动分不开的。例如，在埃伦伯格县，就组织了近千人的宣传队伍，在罗斯托克专区，组织了二千五百人的宣传队伍。宣传队员们深入农村，向农民宣传党的政策，讲解合作化的优越性。干部在和农民共同劳动中，更好地了解到农民的问题，并帮助他们解决问题。许多地方还组织个体农民参观成立较早的农业生产合作社。
    德意志民主共和国的农业合作化运动是在同从西德和西柏林发出的反动宣传进行尖锐斗争的情况下发展的。最近一个时期，西德、西柏林的反动宣传机器，特别是西柏林美占区的“里亚斯”电台，不断地对德意志民主共和国的农业合作化运动进行污蔑和造谣。德意志民主共和国的报刊对这些反动宣传给予了坚决的回击，大批的个体农民加入合作社是对西德的反动宣传的最好回答。
    合作化了的农村，现在到处呈现一片新气象。许多新成立的合作社都讨论了今年的生产计划，忙着准备春播。老合作社正在研究增加新社员后怎样扩大经营的问题。各地党委和政府机关也正在抽调和训练干部，帮助合作社健全组织和开展生产工作。
    新华社柏林22日电　这里的报纸今天刊登了德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希写给全国农民的信，这封信向最近相继出现的四个全部合作化的专区的农民致以热烈的祝贺。
    乌布利希在信中指出，在四个已经全部合作化的专区——罗斯托克、新勃兰登堡、法兰克福和波茨坦专区——的上空，现在飘扬着社会主义的光荣旗帜，它向男女农民、特别是农村青年指明了通向幸福的未来的道路。这四个专区过去曾经是属于德国的最落后的农业地区之列，现在，它们正在变成现代化的工农业地区。
    乌布利希说，在过去几个星期中，农业合作化运动之所以能够取得迅速发展，主要是由于大多数农民了解到，只有通过合作化才能实现农业的进一步大发展。他指出，农业合作化还为最后消灭封建和法西斯残余影响创造了条件。
    乌布利希在信中指出，农业合作社在增强德意志民主共和国力量并使它对西德人民更具有吸引力方面，作出了重要贡献。当前的迫切任务是扩大和巩固合作社，并使它们发展成为模范的社会主义生产单位。
    乌布利希继续说，已经全部合作化的乡村在发展和组织工作上出现了很多新问题，这些问题在同全体合作社社员协商以后是能够很好加以解决的。新的农业生产合作社应该研究那些成立较早和有成绩的农业生产合作社的生产方法，有经验的合作社社员应当帮助新的合作社。
    乌布利希说，现在的主要任务是加速进行春播。在春播以前应该利用一切可能，把小块土地合并起来。必须最大限度地利用拖拉机和农业机器。在仍然有一些个体农民的乡村内，机器拖拉机站、农业生产合作社和个体农民应该共同努力使春播工作尽快完成。
    乌布利希表示，他相信继续想用旧的方式来劳动的个体农民会逐渐接受合作化的劳动方式。
    乌布利希号召乡村地区的党组织、群众组织、全国阵线和政府机构把注意力集中到农业生产方面，他还号召有经验的合作社社员、农业专家参加社会主义劳动集体，以便共同完成所有的农业任务。
