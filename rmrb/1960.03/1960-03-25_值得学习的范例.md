    A Worthy Example to Learn From

    Under the inspiration of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, all the staff and workers of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute, responding to the call of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China to advance towards mechanization, electrification, automation, and factoryization and to vigorously develop radio technology, promoted the pioneering spirit of communism, broke through all kinds of old rules and regulations, scaled the heights of science and technology, and achieved the electrification of calculation and the printing of drawings. This is a great revolution in design work. It establishes design work on a new technical foundation, making each process of design work more specialized, thereby increasing labor efficiency tenfold or a hundredfold. At the same time, it frees a large amount of labor from complex, trivial, and mechanical mental labor, allowing them to engage in scientific research, go deep into the field, and conduct political, scientific, and cultural studies. All of this opens up new and broad avenues for the rapid improvement of the level of design work.

    The design work revolution of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute is not only a worthy example for design departments to learn from, but also for the staff and workers on all fronts of socialist economic construction.

    In the process of continuously improving labor productivity and rapidly developing productive forces, the most urgent and prominent task is to learn and master advanced science and technology and to scale the heights of science and technology. Not only should scientific research institutions vigorously carry out scientific research, adhering to the principle of science serving production, and arm the cause of production and construction with new scientific achievements, but also production and construction departments must combine production with a wide-scale mobilization of the masses to carry out scientific research and vigorously reform production technology. To carry out mass scientific and technological research work, it is first necessary to eliminate all kinds of superstitious ideas and mystical views of science and technology, such as: only university students can engage in scientific and technological research; only experts can engage in scientific and technological creation; problems that scientists have not solved cannot be solved by workers and ordinary technicians, and so on. When we have not yet mobilized the masses to learn, understand, and study these scientific and technological problems that only experts could previously access, these superstitious ideas and scientific mystical views will always exist and have their market. However, when we mobilize the masses to carefully understand and study the laws related to these problems, we will gradually understand some of the mysteries. Through hard study, we can master objective laws, solve problems that could not be solved in the past, and make innovations. At this time, people will also break superstitions and dispel the mentality that science is unattainable. Some ordinary staff members of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute who graduated from senior high school and junior high school, and some higher engineering technicians who had not studied electrical engineering, when they heard the call of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee to advance towards "four modernizations" (mechanization, electrification, automation, and factoryization) and to vigorously develop radio technology, most of them had doubts and concerns. However, with the enthusiastic encouragement and support of the Party branch, after several days and nights of study, they created various resistance analog computers suitable for work requirements. They said: "Before, we thought these things were really complicated, and we couldn't do them at all; now that we've made them, we think these things are quite simple." It can be seen that superstitious ideas and mystical views are ideological reflections in the state of not mastering objective laws. As long as we earnestly study, as long as we master objective laws, superstitious ideas will naturally disappear. It is precisely like this: the more superstitious ideas one has, the less one dares to do; the less one dares to do, the more superstitious ideas one has. To break this negative cycle, one must have the pioneering spirit of daring to think and daring to act. Dialectical materialists believe that the development of all things has its inherent objective laws, and all objective laws can be understood. Anyone who is willing to work hard and persist in research can master objective laws.

    What force makes people dare to think and dare to act and create miracles in scientific and technological work? The design work revolution of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute once again vividly demonstrated the infinite power of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, demonstrated the commanding role of politics, and demonstrated the great power of mass movements.

    Advancing towards science and technology, carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, although the problems to be solved are production technology problems, the decisive factor, like all other work, is the leadership of the Party. The Party organization of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute followed the Party's mass line and organized an unprecedentedly broad mass movement in carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. After some advanced elements took the lead in making achievements, the Party organization guided the situation and organized all the staff and workers of the institute to participate in the movement. Not only did ordinary staff members participate in the movement, but also senior technicians participated in the movement. Technological innovation and technological revolution are an important part of the entire socialist construction cause and a cause for the entire people, and it must not rely on a small number of people. Under the leadership of the Party, the method of "three-in-one combination" of leading cadres, technicians, and workers is an effective method for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and it is also the most important method that must be adopted in the future. The roles of these three aspects should be fully utilized to promote each other and complement each other. It is necessary to organize the masses and senior technicians to adopt the method of learning, teaching, researching, and doing at the same time, conduct collective research, let everyone put forward diverse technological transformation plans and suggestions, so that we can broaden our thinking, inspire each other, concentrate advantages, and make innovation and creation achieve the results of more, faster, better, and more economical.

### 值得学习的范例

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    值得学习的范例
    沈阳铝镁设计研究院的全体职工，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，响应中共辽宁省委关于向机械化、电气化、自动化、工厂化进军和大办无线电的号召，发扬共产主义的首创精神，冲破种种陈规旧律，攀登科学技术高峰，实现了计算电气化、制图印刷化。这是设计工作的大革命。它把设计工作建立在新的技术基础之上，使设计工作的各个工序更加专业化，因而也就成十、成百倍地提高了劳动效率。同时，又使大量的劳动力从繁复、琐细和机械的脑力劳动中解放出来，去从事科学研究工作，深入现场，进行政治、科学、文化的学习。所有这些，为设计工作水平的飞速提高开辟了新的广阔道路。
    沈阳铝镁设计研究院的设计工作革命，绝不仅仅是设计部门值得学习的范例，同时也值得社会主义经济建设各个战线的职工同志们学习。
    在不断提高劳动生产率、迅速地发展生产力的过程中，最迫切、最突出的一项任务就是学习和掌握先进的科学技术，攀登科学技术高峰。不仅科学研究机关要本着科学为生产服务的原则，大力开展科学研究，用新的科学成果来武装生产建设事业，生产建设部门也必须结合生产，广泛发动群众进行科学研究，大力改革生产技术。而要开展群众性的科学技术研究工作，首先就必须消除各种各样的迷信思想和对科学技术的神秘观点，诸如：不是大学生不能搞科学技术研究；不是专家不能搞科学技术创造；科学家没解决的问题，工人群众和一般技术人员不能解决等等。当我们还没有发动群众去学习、了解和研究这些过去只有专家才能接触的科学技术问题的时候，这些迷信思想和科学神秘的观点总是会存在并且有它的市场的。可是，当我们发动群众用心地去了解和研究有关这些问题的规律的时候，就会逐步地懂得其中的一些奥妙，而经过刻苦的钻研，就能掌握客观规律，解决过去不能解决的问题，做出革新创造。这时，人们也就会破除迷信，打消科学高不可攀的心理。沈阳铝镁设计研究院的一些高职、初中毕业的普通工作人员，和一些没有学过电学的较高的工程技术人员，听到辽宁省委关于向“四化”（机械化、电气化、自动化、工厂化）进军和大办无线电的号召时，他们大都是曾经有过怀疑、有过顾虑的。可是在党支部热情鼓励和支持下，经过几昼夜的钻研，就创造出了各种适合工作要求的电阻模拟计算器。他们说：“以前觉得这些东西真复杂，我们根本没法搞；现在做出来了，就觉得这些东西也挺简单。”可见，迷信思想和神秘观点是在没有掌握客观规律的状况下的思想反映，只要踏踏实实地去研究，只要掌握了客观规律，迷信思想也就自然会消失。事情正是这样，越有迷信思想越不敢做，越不敢做越有迷信思想，而要打破这种消极的循环，就必须有敢想敢干的首创精神。辩证唯物主义者认为，一切事物的发展都有它内在的客观规律，而一切客观规律都是可以认识的，凡是肯于下苦工夫，坚持不懈地进行钻研的人，都可以掌握客观的规律。
    是什么力量使人们敢想敢干，在科学技术工作上创造出奇迹呢？沈阳铝镁设计研究院的设计工作大革命，又一次生动地显示了党的社会主义建设总路线的无穷威力，显示了政治的统帅作用，显示了群众运动的巨大力量。
    向科学技术进军、进行技术革新和技术革命，所要解决的问题虽是生产技术问题，但和一切其他工作一样，起决定作用的是党的领导。沈阳铝镁设计研究院的党组织，遵循党的群众路线，在开展技术革新和技术革命中，组织了空前广泛的群众运动。当一些先进分子带头做出成绩以后，党组织就因势利导，把全院职工都组织到运动中来。不仅是一般的工作人员普遍参加了运动，高级的技术人员也参加了运动。技术革新和技术革命，是整个社会主义建设事业的重要组成部分，是全民的事业，绝不能依靠少数人来进行。在党的领导下，领导干部、技术人员和工人群众“三结合”的方法，是进行技术革新和技术革命行之有效的方法，也是今后必须采用的最主要的方法。这三方面的作用，都应该充分地发挥，使三者互相促进，相辅相成。要组织群众和高级技术人员，采取边学、边教、边研究、边做的方法，进行集体研究，让大家提出多种多样的技术改造的方案和建议，这样就可以广开思路、互相启发、集中优点，使革新创造收到多、快、好、省的效果。（摘自辽宁日报）
