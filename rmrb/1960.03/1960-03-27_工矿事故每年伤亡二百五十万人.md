    West Germany
    According to a recent report in the West German "Die Welt," nearly two and a half million people are injured or killed annually in West German industrial and commercial enterprises due to accidents. Among them, about seven thousand people die, and one hundred and fifty thousand people have their future work ability affected due to injuries. Work-related accidents cause economic losses exceeding 5 billion marks, a figure equivalent to 14% of West Germany's 1960 budget.
