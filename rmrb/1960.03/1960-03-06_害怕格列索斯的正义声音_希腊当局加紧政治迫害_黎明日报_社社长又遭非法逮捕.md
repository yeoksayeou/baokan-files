Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, Athens dispatch via TASS: The Greek political police arrested Kirkos, the president of "Dawn Daily" and member of the Executive Committee of the United Democratic Left Party, on the morning of the 2nd and immediately began interrogating him.

The "crime" charged against Kirkos is "insulting the authorities"; and the entire fact constituting this "crime" is that "Dawn Daily" published a letter on February 28th from the illegally sentenced Greek national hero Glezos. This letter protested the military court's verdict against him and other patriots and called on all good people in the world to unite to repeal this unreasonable verdict and defend Greek democracy.

Glezos will also be tried for protesting the military court's unreasonable verdict. The trials of Glezos and Kirkos are scheduled for March 15th.

The Supreme Court will consider Glezos's appeal on March 12th. The Greek public demands the revocation of the military court's unreasonable verdicts against Glezos and other patriots and the restoration of their freedom.

    害怕格列索斯的正义声音
    希腊当局加紧政治迫害
   “黎明日报”社社长又遭非法逮捕
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：希腊政治警察2日早晨逮捕了“黎明日报”社社长，统一民主左翼党执行委员会委员基尔科斯，并且立即开始审讯他。
    加给基尔科斯的“罪名”是：“侮辱当局”；而构成这一“罪名”的全部事实是：“黎明日报”曾在2月28日发表了已被非法判刑的希腊民族英雄格列索斯的一封信，这封信抗议军事法庭对他及其他爱国者的判决，并且要求全世界善良的人们团结起来，为撤销这种无理判决和保卫希腊民主而斗争。
    格列索斯也因为对军事法庭的无理判决提出了抗议而要受审。对格列索斯和基尔科斯的审讯定在3月15日进行。
    最高法庭将在3月12日考虑格列索斯的上诉书。希腊公众要求撤销军事法庭对格列索斯及其他爱国者的无理判决并且恢复他们的自由。
