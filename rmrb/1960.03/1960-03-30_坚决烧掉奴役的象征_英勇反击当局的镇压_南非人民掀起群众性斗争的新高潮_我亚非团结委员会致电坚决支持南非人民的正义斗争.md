Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Johannesburg News: The South African people, in order to resolutely oppose the "Pass Laws" of racial discrimination and persecution, are fighting more and more bravely and with high morale. Yesterday, they launched a new upsurge of mass struggle. Africans held large-scale strikes and demonstrations throughout the country, setting fires everywhere to burn the "Passes" that the authorities forced them to carry.

On March 28th, Africans, who account for three-quarters of the population of the Union of South Africa, responded to the call of the African National Congress of South Africa and held a "Day of Mourning" with grief and indignation to mourn their compatriots who were murdered by the South African Federal Government in Sharpeville and other places last week. More than 90% of African workers across the country did not go to work. The economic activities of the three major industrial centers of South Africa - Johannesburg, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth - were basically at a standstill. In Johannesburg, the vast majority of the 750,000 African workers (including the unemployed) did not go to work, and there were hardly any passengers on buses. In Cape Town, the strike struggle of African workers has continued for six days. The construction work has completely stopped because all 500 African employees building the new power station in Cape Town did not go to work. In Sharpeville, where bloody suppression occurred last week, the police used force to force Africans to go to work, but the Africans were not intimidated.

Angry Africans continued to demonstrate in many places yesterday and fought back against the police who suppressed them. In Cape Town, about 1,000 Africans demonstrated in the city center square last night. Armed police beat the demonstrators with batons and threw tear gas at them. The Africans bravely resisted with stones. The police later opened fire on the demonstrators. In some African residential areas near Cape Town, Africans held similar demonstrations. In extreme anger, the demonstrators burned down the buildings of local government and police agencies.

In Moroka, Alexandra, and Kliptown, African residential areas near Johannesburg, Africans demonstrated near the train station to oppose the authorities' attempts to undermine the strike. The large number of police and three armored vehicles sent by the authorities to reinforce the area aroused even greater indignation among the demonstrators. They fought back with sticks and stones and shouted "Africa must be returned to us."

In Orlando, a suburb of Johannesburg, Africans once surrounded the local police station last night. The police carried out another bloody suppression, resulting in some African casualties.

Following the public burning of the "Pass," which he called a "symbol of enslavement" by the white government, by Albert Luthuli, president of the African National Congress, on the 27th, Africans in Johannesburg and other places also burned the "Passes" they hated so much yesterday. Everywhere you could see raging bonfires fueled by these "Passes," and Africans shouted "Africa" slogans beside the bonfires.

At the same time, the South African Federal authorities are still using various means to try to stop the rising tide of African anger against the "Pass Laws." In Johannesburg, the police once again raided and searched the offices of the African National Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions, and other organizations in Johannesburg yesterday, and looted some documents. The South African Federal Parliament, manipulated by the white government, passed the ban on the activities of the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress and other organizations in the first reading last night. The police authorities also announced that burning "Passes" was a "criminal act," and Africans still needed to obtain "Passes" from their employers when going out. Despite this, the Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa warned the South African authorities yesterday that if the "Pass Laws" were not abolished before the 29th, they would launch a more intense struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The Chinese Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress, firmly supporting the just struggle of the African people against racial discrimination and for basic human rights. The telegram said: "The Chinese people are extremely angry at the bloody crimes committed by the South African Federal authorities in brutally massacring unarmed Africans. We lodge the strongest protest to the South African Federal authorities and express our firm support to the African brothers who oppose racial discrimination and strive for basic human rights.

"The heroic struggle of the South African people against the 'Pass Laws' has been unanimously supported by the Asian and African people and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world, and has launched a huge movement against racial discrimination and persecution worldwide. Although the South African reactionary government is still continuing to carry out frantic suppression and playing some tricks to ease the struggle, this will absolutely not subdue or deceive the heroic South African people. We believe that as long as the South African people unite as one and carry out the struggle to the end, they will surely be able to smash the chains of colonialists enslaving Africans and will surely achieve final victory."

    坚决烧掉奴役的象征　英勇反击当局的镇压
    南非人民掀起群众性斗争的新高潮
    我亚非团结委员会致电坚决支持南非人民的正义斗争
    新华社29日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非人民为了坚决反对种族歧视和迫害的“通行证法”，正愈战愈勇，斗志昂扬，昨天他们掀起了群众性斗争的新高潮。非洲人在全国各地举行了大规模罢工和示威，到处点燃起怒火烧毁当局强迫他们携带的“通行证”。
    3月28日，占南非联邦四分之三人口的非洲人，响应南非非洲人国民大会的号召，怀着悲愤的心情举行“哀悼日”，哀悼上星期在沙佩维尔等地被南非联邦政府杀害的同胞。全国各地有90％以上的非洲工人都没有去上工。南非三个大工业中心——约翰内斯堡、开普敦和伊丽莎伯港的经济活动基本上陷于停顿。在约翰内斯堡，七十五万非洲工人（包括失业的在内）中的绝大部分都没有去上班，公共汽车几乎没有乘客。在开普敦，非洲工人已经持续了六天的罢工斗争，由于建筑开普敦新发电站的全部五百名非洲雇工没有上工，建筑工程已完全停顿。在上星期发生血腥镇压事件的沙佩维尔，警察用武力逼迫非洲人上工，但非洲人并没有被吓倒。
    愤怒的非洲人昨天继续在许多地方举行了示威，并对镇压他们的警察进行反击。在开普敦，昨晚约一千名非洲人在市中心广场举行示威，武装警察用警棍殴打示威者，并向他们投掷催泪弹，非洲人用石块进行英勇的反抗。警察后来还向示威者开枪。在开普敦附近一些非洲人聚居地区，非洲人举行了同样的示威。示威者在极端愤怒的情况下，烧毁了当地政府和警察机关的建筑物。
    在约翰内斯堡附近非洲人聚居的莫罗卡、亚历山大和克利普镇，非洲人在火车站附近举行示威，反对当局企图破坏罢工。当局派去增援的大批警察和三辆装甲车激起了示威者的更大愤慨，他们用棍棒和石块进行反击，并且高呼“必须把非洲还给我们”。
    在约翰内斯堡郊外的奥兰多，非洲人在昨夜曾经一度包围了当地的警察局。警察又进行血腥镇压，结果有一些非洲人伤亡。
    继非洲人国民大会主席卢图利27日当众焚毁了他称之为白人政府
  “奴役的象征”的“通行证”之后，约翰内斯堡等地的非洲人昨天也纷纷烧毁了他们极端痛恨的“通行证”。到处可以看到以这种“通行证”为燃料的熊熊的火堆，非洲人在火堆旁边高呼“非洲”口号。
    同时，南非联邦当局仍然在采用各种手段，企图阻挡日益高涨的非洲人坚决反对“通行证法”的怒潮。在约翰内斯堡，警察昨天再度袭击和搜查了非洲人国民大会，南非工会大会等组织在约翰内斯堡的办公室，并劫走了一些文件。白人政府操纵的南非联邦议会昨晚一读通过了禁止非洲人国民大会和泛非主义者大会等组织活动的禁令。警察当局还宣布，烧毁“通行证”是“犯罪的行为”，非洲人外出时还需要从他们的雇主那里取得“通行证”。尽管如此，南非泛非主义者大会昨天向南非当局提出警告说，如果不在29日以前废除“通行证法”，他们将展开更激烈的斗争。
    新华社29日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天致电非洲人国民大会和泛非主义者大会，坚决支持非洲人民反对种族歧视、争取基本人权的正义斗争。电报说：“中国人民对南非联邦当局横蛮屠杀手无寸铁的非洲人所犯下的血腥罪行感到无比愤怒，我们向南非联邦当局提出最强烈的抗议，并向反对种族歧视，争取基本人权的非洲弟兄们表示坚决的支持。
    “南非人民反抗‘通行证法’的英勇斗争，已得到了亚非人民和全世界爱好和平和正义人民的一致支持，并已在世界范围内掀起了一个反对种族歧视和迫害的巨大运动。尽管南非反动政府还在继续进行疯狂镇压和玩弄一些缓和斗争的手法，但这绝对压服不了和欺骗不了英勇的南非人民。我们相信，只要南非人民团结一致，把斗争进行到底，一定能够粉碎殖民者奴役非洲人的锁链，一定能够取得最后胜利。”（附图片）
