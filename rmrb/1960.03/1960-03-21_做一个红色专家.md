    Be a Red Expert

    This year, Jilin Province has promoted 57 veteran workers and 17 cooks, barbers, and service personnel to the positions of engineers and technicians. Changsha City recently promoted 42 workers and 5 farmers to engineers or agricultural technicians. The Yumen Petroleum Administration has selected a large number of technical cadres from among the workers, and Beijing recently promoted 28 nursing staff to deputy directors and deputy chiefs of departments. This fully embodies the Party's high regard and care for the wisdom and talents of the workers and peasants.

    In the old society, workers, peasants, nurses, cooks, barbers, and service personnel were discriminated against. It was said that the professions they engaged in were "lowly," "mean," and without prospects. After liberation, the situation completely changed. Engaging in any job is a glorious post. The political status of workers, peasants, nurses, cooks, barbers, and service personnel has also been greatly improved. Many people's representatives and advanced workers are workers, peasants, nurses, cooks, barbers, and service personnel. After deeply investigating the big-character posters of the employees of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant in September 1957, Comrade Liu Shaoqi encouraged the Party Secretary, Director, Chairman of the Trade Union, and Secretary of the Communist Youth League of the plant to participate in physical labor in the future, saying: "Our country is a country led by the proletariat. To lead this country, we must have people from this class. Therefore, in the future, to be a cadre, one must not only have a cultural level, but also be from the boiler room, workshop, or farming background." Jilin Province, Changsha City, Yumen Petroleum Administration, and Beijing have promoted a group of workers, peasants, nurses, cooks, barbers, and service personnel who resolutely implement the Party's guidelines and policies, are proactive, hardworking, and dedicated, and have made outstanding achievements in the cause of socialist construction, to serve as engineers, technicians, and leaders. This once again shows that only under the leadership of the Party and in the era of socialism can the talents and wisdom of the working people be fully developed. Everyone should learn from their working spirit, constantly improve themselves, do their job well, and contribute all their strength to the cause of socialist construction, becoming red experts.

    做一个红色专家
    祖年
    吉林省今年以来，提拔了五十七名老工人和十七名厨师、理发员、服务员为工程师和技师；长沙市最近提拔四十二名工人和五名农民为工程师或农业技师；玉门石油管理局从工人中选拔大批技术干部；北京市最近提拔二十八名护理人员为副院长、科副主任。这件事，充分体现了党对工农群众的聪明才智高度的重视和关怀。
    在旧社会里，工人、农民、护士、厨师、理发员、服务员是被人歧视的，说他们从事的职业，是“低下”、“卑贱”、没有出息的。解放后，情况完全改变了。从事任何工作，都是光荣的岗位；工人、农民、护士、厨师、理发员、服务员的政治地位也有了很大的提高。人民代表、先进工作者有许多是工人、农民、护士、厨师、理发员、服务员。刘少奇同志在1957年9月深入北京石景山发电厂看职工大字报后，勉励这个厂的党委书记、厂长、工会主席、团委书记今后都要参加体力劳动时说：“我们的国家是无产阶级领导的国家，要领导这个国家，就要有这个阶级出身的人。因此，今后当干部不但要有文化程度，还必须是从锅炉房、车间或者种地出身的人”。吉林省、长沙市、玉门石油管理局、北京市提拔一批坚决贯彻党的方针政策的、积极努力和任劳任怨的、为社会主义建设事业做出了优异成绩的工人、农民、护士、厨师、理发员、服务员，担任工程师、技师和领导工作，又一次说明了，只有在党的领导下，在社会主义的时代，劳动人民的才能和智慧才能得到充分发挥。大家应该学习他们这种工作精神，不断提高自己，做好工作，为社会主义建设事业贡献出自己所有的力量，成为红色专家。
