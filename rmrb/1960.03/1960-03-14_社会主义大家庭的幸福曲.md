The Happy Song of the Socialist Family
Ma Wenbing, Renmin University of China

In order to meet the needs of professional and amateur drama troupes and drama enthusiasts across the country, the China Drama Publishing House cooperated with the Workers' Publishing House and spent only three days publishing the script of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," collectively created by the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Theater. The Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Distribution Office also made preparations and immediately mailed it to local branches for sale upon receipt.

After reading the inspiring report "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" published in the China Youth Daily on February 28, it immediately occurred to me that if our artists could recreate it on the stage, it would certainly educate more people. Excitingly, only about ten days after the publication of this report, we have already seen the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Theater's performance of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers." This is truly a happy symphony of the socialist family.

The play's authors and actors eulogize with full enthusiasm the great class friendship and lofty communist style of the people in our society. The play features a series of ordinary characters who shine with communist brilliance, and they are good examples we should learn from. In particular, the images of several Party leaders in the play make people feel very cordial. They care so much about every builder, treating the masses as even closer than their own brothers.

After watching this play, we have a clearer understanding of how happy it is to live today, and we deeply feel the warmth of our socialist family; at the same time, we also see the unparalleled strength of the people who are united around the Party and striving for a common goal.

It is hoped that drama workers can continue to use this spirit of the Great Leap Forward to play the role of drama art in educating the people quickly and well in the future.

    社会主义大家庭的幸福曲
    中国人民大学　马文兵
    中国戏剧出版社为了满足全国专业和业余话剧团体以及话剧爱好者的需要，和工人出版社合作，只用了三天时间，就出版了中央戏剧学院实验话剧院集体创作的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”剧本。新华书店北京发行所也作好了准备，收到书后立即邮寄给各地分店发售。
    看了2月28日中国青年报上刊登的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的振奋人心的通讯以后，使我立刻想到，要是我们的艺术家能把它重现在舞台上，一定能使更多的人受到教育。令人兴奋的是，这篇报道发表还不过十天左右，我们已经看到了中央戏剧学院实验话剧院演出的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”。这真是一支社会主义大家庭的幸福交响曲。
    这个剧的作者和演员以满腔的热情歌颂了我们这个社会人民的伟大的阶级友爱精神，和崇高的共产主义风格。剧中出现了一系列平凡而又闪耀着共产主义光芒的人物形象，他们是我们应该学习的好榜样。特别是其中的几个党的领导人的形象，使人感到十分亲切。他们是那样关怀着每一个建设者，把群众看得比自己的亲弟兄还亲。
    看完了这个剧使我们更明确地认识到生活在今天是多么幸福，使我们深刻地体会到我国社会主义大家庭的温暖；同时，也使我们看到团结在党的周围、为共同目的而奋斗的人民群众的无比强大的力量。
    希望话剧工作者今后能继续以这样的大跃进的精神，又快又好地发挥话剧艺术教育人民的作用。
