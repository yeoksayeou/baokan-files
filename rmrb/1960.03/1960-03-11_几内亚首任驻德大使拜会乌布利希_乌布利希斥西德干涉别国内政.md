Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 10th: According to a report by the German News Agency, Sékou Conté, the first Guinean ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, formally paid a courtesy call on Walter Ulbricht, First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, on the 9th.

During the visit, Ambassador Conté conveyed greetings on behalf of the Guinean people and President Touré. Ulbricht expressed his gratitude for the greetings and pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is willing to conduct sound cooperation with the independent Republic of Guinea and the people of all other African countries in political, economic, and cultural fields. Ulbricht also stated that the Bonn government has no right to interfere in the internal affairs and foreign relations of other countries, but it seems unable to accustom itself to the fact that African countries expect their sovereignty to be respected. Ulbricht pointed out that the recent remarks made by the Bonn reactionaries are reminiscent of the old colonial methods of German militarists.

    乌布利希斥西德干涉别国内政
    据新华社柏林10日电　据德意志通讯社报道：几内亚驻德意志民主共和国第一任大使塞杜·康特，9日正式拜会了德意志民主共和国政府第一副总理乌布利希。
    拜会时，康特大使代表几内亚人民和几内亚总统杜尔致祝词。乌布利希对祝词表示感谢，并且指出，德意志民主共和国愿意同独立的几内亚共和国以及非洲所有其他国家的人民在政治、经济和文化方面进行良好的合作。乌布利希还说，波恩政府无权干涉其他国家的内政和外交关系，可是，它似乎不能使自己习惯于这样的事实：非洲国家盼望自己的主权得到尊重。乌布利希指出，波恩反动派最近发出的言论，使人想起德国军国主义者的旧殖民手法。
