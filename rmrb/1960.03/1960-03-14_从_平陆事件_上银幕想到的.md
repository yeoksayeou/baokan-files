    Thoughts Inspired by "The Pinglu Incident" on the Silver Screen
    Wang Shushun
    In the evening, passing by the entrance of the special medicine store, I saw the mercury lamps shining brightly upstairs, and a generator roaring at the entrance. It turned out that the Beijing Film Studio was busily filming "For Sixty-One Class Brothers." When I finished reading the report about the Pinglu incident in the newspaper, I was moved to tears; at the same time, I felt that the report itself was an excellent film script, and it would be best to make it into a movie so that the people of the whole country could see this new paean to communism with their own eyes. Unexpectedly, in just a few days, the film has already started shooting, and the filmmakers have learned from the spirit of high speed and great cooperation shown by the people of the capital and other places in rescuing the Pinglu poisoned workers, and decided to complete the film in March and show it to audiences across the country on the screen. This is really inspiring! Such an unprecedented scale and speed of scriptwriting and film production could only become a reality in our era.
    I was naturally reminded of a French progressive film I saw a few years ago – "Brothers All Over the World." It also depicted the story of people rescuing sailors suffering from food poisoning. The crew of that French fishing boat sent out a distress signal in the Atlantic Ocean, and through radio contact, it went through the hands of amateur radio enthusiasts in several countries, and finally the medicine was airdropped onto the ship, saving all the crew members. However, their hope of being rescued was so small, and there was no reliable social organization that could give them hope. The factors that relayed the signals in the middle were also completely accidental. If any link in this accidentally connected thread was broken or delayed by a few tens of minutes, then the fate awaiting them would only be death!
    However, in our country, people's fate is completely different!
    Please see: As soon as the news of the poisoning of sixty-one class brothers spread, the county party committee meeting was immediately suspended, and all efforts were organized to rescue them; as soon as the old boatman on the Yellow River heard about rescuing class brothers, without saying a word, relying on decades of experience, he broke the old rule that the Yellow River should not be crossed at night; when medicine could not be found in several places, they said: "We have to trouble the central government and ask the capital for help." Listen, how much pride and trust is contained in this sentence! As soon as this sentence was uttered, a series of battles immediately continued in the capital. Thanks to the vigorous support of party committees at all levels and the promotion of the spirit of people's communism, the rescue was fully guaranteed. Here, everyone breathes and shares the same fate with the collective and with the sixty-one class brothers. The sixty-one class brothers in Pinglu County will definitely be rescued! This is guaranteed from the very beginning by our superior social system which is full of vitality.

### 从“平陆事件”上银幕想到的

    从“平陆事件”上银幕想到的
    王树舜
    晚上，路过特种药品商店门口，见楼上水银灯照得一片雪亮，门口一部发电机吼声轰鸣。原来北京电影制片厂正在这里紧张地拍摄影片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”。在读完报上关于平陆事件的这个报道时，我就感动得热泪盈眶；同时觉得这个报道本身就是一个出色的电影文学剧本，最好拍成电影，让全国人民亲眼看到这又一曲共产主义的凯歌。不料只几天功夫，影片真的已经开拍了，而且电影工作者们学习了首都和各地人民抢救平陆中毒民工时候那种高速度和大协作的精神，决定在3月份内就把这部影片拍成并在银幕上和全国观众见面。这实在令人振奋！这种史无前例的编剧和摄制电影的规模和速度，也只有我们这样的时代里，才有成为现实的可能。
    我很自然地联想起几年前看到的一部法国进步影片——“四海之内皆兄弟”。那里面描写的也是人们援救患食物中毒的船员们的故事。那艘法国渔船的船员们在大西洋上发出求援讯号，通过无线电的联系辗转经过几个国家的业余无线电爱好者之手，最后终于把药物空投到船上，使全体船员获救。但是，他们获救的希望是那么渺小，没有一种可靠的社会组织可以使他们寄托自己的希望。那些中途传递信号的因素也都是完全出于偶然的，只要这条偶然连接起来的线索上的任何一个环节中断了，或者耽误上几十分钟，那么等待着他们的命运就只有死亡！
    但是，在我们的国家里，人们的命运却完全不同！
    请看：六十一位阶级弟兄中毒的消息一传出，县委的会议立即中止，全力组织抢救；黄河上的老艄公一听抢救阶级弟兄，二话不说，凭着几十年的经验，打破了黄河不夜渡的老例；当几处地方都找不到药时，他们说：“只好麻烦中央，向首都求援。”听，这句话里包含着多少自豪和信任！这句话一出口，一连串的战斗就立即在首都接续下去了。由于各级党委的大力支援，人民共产主义精神的发扬，使营救得到了充分的保证。在这里，每个人都和集体，都和那六十一位阶级弟兄同呼吸共命运。平陆县的六十一位阶级弟兄一定能获救，这是肯定的！这一点，是为我们这充满着生命力的优越的社会制度从根本上保证了的。
