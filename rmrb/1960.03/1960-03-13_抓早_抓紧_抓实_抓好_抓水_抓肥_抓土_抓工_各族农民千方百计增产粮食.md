    Farmers of All Nationalities are Doing Everything Possible to Increase Grain Production

    This newspaper reports: The seven million Mongol, Han, Hui, Manchu, and other ethnic farmers of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are leveraging the immense power of the people's communes to strive for an even greater grain harvest this year. A battle to seize time, grab speed, rush preparations, and welcome spring plowing is fiercely underway on both sides of the Yellow River, north and south of the Yin Mountains, in the West Liao River basin, and on the banks of the Nen River.
    Grasping early, grasping tightly, grasping practically, and grasping well are the four major characteristics of this year's preparatory farming movement in the autonomous region. This year's preparatory farming upsurge is more than a month earlier than in 1959, and the labor attendance rate has significantly increased. The attendance rates of members in Ulanqab League and Zhaowuda League and other places have reached about 93% and 95% respectively.
    Based on the rich experience of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia recognize the truth that "soil is the root, fertilizer is the strength, water is life, and seeds are the foundation." In the preparatory farming movement, they have firmly grasped the three measures of increasing production: "water, fertilizer, and soil." Currently, the entire region has completed more than 6,500 water conservancy projects that will benefit this year. Many areas are focusing on canal construction, having dug more than 15,000 canals of all levels, drilled more than 10,000 wells, tapped more than 700 springs, and expanded the irrigated area by more than 1.87 million mu. At present, more than 11,000 water conservancy projects, more than 100 key projects, the Yellow River San Shenggong key hub project, and the two major main canals north and south of the Yellow River are under intense construction. The 700,000 members of all ethnic groups on water conservancy construction sites throughout the region are full of vigor and high spirits, determined to work hard in March and complete 70%-80% of the water conservancy project plan, so that most of the projects under construction will be completed before spring sowing and put into spring irrigation. Farmers of all ethnic groups have also seized the favorable conditions of the autonomous region, which has many rivers, lakes, springs, and a large amount of ice and snow, and carried out extensive ice storage, snow accumulation, snow sweeping to return to the fields, and ice transportation into the fields with the spirit of "three waters" (sky, surface, and underground) used in parallel. At present, the entire region has stored 1.1 billion cubic meters of ice and water, completing more than 73% of the region's ice storage plan by the end of March. Now, some areas are beginning to irrigate early in the spring, and Zhaowuda League, which already has signs of spring drought, has now broken ice and spring irrigated more than 230,000 mu of land. Rolling the ground to preserve moisture and water and soil conservation work are of great significance on the Inner Mongolian Plateau, which has nine droughts in ten years. At present, the entire region has rolled more than 18.8 million mu of land to preserve moisture, accounting for more than 30% of the land that was plowed last autumn, reaching the rolled area at the beginning of spring plowing in late March last year; the area of water and soil conservation has reached more than 2,000 square kilometers. This water conservancy movement has created extremely favorable conditions for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.
    In the past, farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia were not accustomed to applying much fertilizer, but this year they have accumulated more than 310 billion catties of fertilizer, which is more than 80 billion catties more than the total amount of fertilizer applied last year. Human and animal manure accounts for 60% of the fertilizer. In addition, 8,675 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants have been established, producing 62,756,000 catties of indigenous chemical fertilizer. Currently, the entire region has sent 157.6 billion catties of fertilizer to the fields (that is, 50.4% of all accumulated fertilizer). In order to speed up the speed of manure delivery, many areas have vigorously tapped transportation potential, organized a large force to carry out a manure delivery blitz, and the entire region has now concentrated 150,000 carts to participate in the manure delivery movement.
    Vigorously grasping soil improvement is an important measure for Inner Mongolia to strive for a bumper harvest of grain this year. From October last year to January this year, the entire region has improved more than 699,000 mu of various low-yield soils. Now, the people's communes in various places are using the powerful strength of the communes, determined to improve 2 million to 3 million mu of soil before spring sowing.
    Vigorously carrying out the technical innovation movement centered on tool reform has special and important significance for Inner Mongolia, which has a vast area and sparse population, to achieve continued leaps forward in agricultural production this year. Now, the vigorous tool reform movement is being carried out extensively and deeply. According to incomplete statistics, the entire region has reformed more than 100,000 tools of various types, of which 190 various advanced tools are being vigorously promoted. (Attached picture)

    各族农民千方百计增产粮食
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区七百万蒙、汉、回、满等族农民发挥着人民公社的巨大威力，力争今年粮食更大丰收。一场争时间、抢速度、突击备耕、迎接春耕的战斗，在黄河两岸、阴山南北、西辽河流域和嫩江之畔激烈进行。
    抓早、抓紧、抓实、抓好是今年自治区备耕运动的四大特点，今年备耕高潮比1959年提前了一个多月，劳动出勤率显著提高，乌兰察布盟和昭乌达盟等地的社员出勤率分别达到了93％和95％左右。
    内蒙古各族农民根据两年大跃进的丰富经验，认识到“土是根、肥是劲、水是命、种是本”的道理，在备耕运动中紧紧抓住了“水、肥、土”这三项增产措施。现在全区已经完成当年受益的水利工程达六千五百多项，不少地区大抓渠系建设，先后挖通各级渠道一万五千多条，打井一万多眼，掏泉七百多处，扩大灌溉面积达一百八十七万多亩。目前有一万一千多项水利工程，一百多项重点工程和黄河三盛公枢纽工程，以及黄河南北的两大干渠，正在紧张施工。全区水利工地上的七十万各族社员，意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心大干3月份，完成水利工程计划的70％—80％，使正在兴建的大部分工程在春播前竣工，投入春浇。各族农民还抓住自治区有许多河流、湖泊、水泉和大量冰雪的有利条件，以“三水”（天上、地上、地下）并用的精神，广泛开展了蓄冰积雪、扫雪归田和运冰进地运动。目前全区已养冰蓄水十一亿立方米，完成全区到3月底养冰蓄水计划的73％以上。现在，有些地区正开始提前春浇，已有春旱迹象的昭乌达盟现已破冰春汇地二十三万多亩。磙地保墒和水土保持工作，在十年九旱的内蒙古高原上，具有重大意义。现在全区已磙地保墒一千八百多万亩，占去年秋翻地的30％以上，达到去年3月下旬春耕开始时的磙地面积；水土保持面积已达二千多平方公里。这个水利运动，为今年农业的特大丰收创造了极为有利的条件。
    过去不习惯多施肥料的内蒙古各族农民，今年已积肥三千一百多亿斤，比去年全年施肥量还多八百多亿斤，肥料中的人畜粪占60％。另外，还建立了八千六百七十五座土化肥厂，生产土化肥六万二千七百五十六万斤，现在全区已把一千五百七十六亿斤的肥料送到地里，
  （即全部积肥的50．4％）。为了加快送粪速度，不少地区大力挖掘了运输潜力，组织千军万马，大搞送肥突击战役，全区现已集中十五万辆大车投入了送粪运动。
    大抓土壤改良，是今年内蒙古争取粮食特大丰收的一个重要措施。从去年10月到今年1月，全区已改良各种低产土壤六十九万九千多亩。现在各地人民公社正运用公社的强大力量，决心在春播前改良土壤二百万到三百万亩。
    大搞以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动，对地广人稀的内蒙古实现今年农业生产继续跃进，有着特殊的重要意义。现在轰轰烈烈的工具改革运动正在广泛深入地开展。据不完全统计，全区已经改革各种工具十万件以上，其中一百九十件各种先进工具正在大力推广。（附图片）
