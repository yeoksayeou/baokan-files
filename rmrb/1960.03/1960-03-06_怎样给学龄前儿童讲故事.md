How to Tell Stories to Preschool Children
Sun Jingxiu

    International Women's Day is coming soon. I would like to give mothers and childcare workers a small gift, which is to talk about how to tell stories to preschool children based on my personal experience. In our lives, we often encounter such situations: children look up with lovely smiling faces and ask us, "Please tell me a story!" or hold up a book with their little hands, "Please tell me about it!" At this time, mothers or childcare workers cannot refuse; moreover, educating children through stories is a very good way.

    Telling stories about current political life, new people and new things in society, and some beautiful fairy tales can not only enrich children's knowledge and stimulate their thinking ability; more importantly, it can also cultivate their love for the motherland and the people, and promote the healthier growth of the minds of our new generation. This is such an important thing! However, in order to truly achieve the purpose of education and at the same time make children satisfied and love to listen, the stories must be selected appropriately and told vividly. The content of the story should be as simple, clear, and easy to understand as possible. When telling it, it should be vivid and lifelike, so that children can hear it as if they see the person and hear the voice. This is the only way it will work.

    When telling stories, you should use vocabulary that children can understand according to their comprehension ability, and use colloquial expressions. Otherwise, they won't understand and won't want to listen. Colloquialism means speaking the way you would normally speak. Don't recite the words from the book to the child, and don't read the book word for word, because you are not teaching him to recite, but telling him a story. As for teaching nursery rhymes and short poems, teaching them word by word is another matter.

    If there are real objects or illustrated children's books, you can point to the real objects or pictures while telling the story. When telling the story, add some supplements to the instructions in the book, and make the words that preschool children cannot understand more popular and easy to understand.

    You can ask children questions during the telling process so that they have the opportunity to express their opinions. For example, ask: "Do you think this is right?" "Why?" In this way, children can better understand the content of the story through thinking, and at the same time, they can attract their attention and arouse their interest.

    There should be expression when telling a story. There should be expression in gestures, tones, and face. Of course, we are not required to tell stories like actors performing on stage. As long as we can express the actions, thoughts, and feelings of the characters in the story with our hand gestures, tones, and facial expressions, so that children can clearly understand and understand who is right and who is wrong, that's fine.

    When telling stories to children, you may encounter the following situations: some children start talking while you are telling the story, some are unwilling to listen and stand up, or some are not focused and look around. When encountering this situation, never get angry with the child, and don't give orders: "Don't talk!" "Don't make noise!" "Sit down and listen!" This will not work well. Forcing a child to listen to a story will make the child feel unhappy. How can we talk about the purpose of education? Of course, it is also unacceptable if we ignore it and continue to tell our story. What should we do? We must find a way to attract the child's attention back. You can use the dialogue of the characters in the story or the sound effects in the story to give the child an auditory stimulus and arouse his new attention. For example, you say: "Oh! The little white rabbit is walking forward, and suddenly a big gray wolf comes. What do you think should be done?" "Hey! What do you think is good?" "Just hear a 'plop'!" When speaking, we strengthen the tone, speak to the child who is talking and unfocused, look at him, or point with a finger. When speaking, we use our hand gestures and expressions to naturally grab the child's attention. This will not affect the progress of the story, nor will it make the child feel embarrassed.

    Some comrades do not have this experience and get anxious when children are not quiet: "Look at how noisy you are? Sit down and listen carefully! Look how well-behaved Xiaolan is? She sits there without moving." Everyone looked and laughed. It turned out that Xiaolan had fallen asleep leaning on the small chair. If we want all children to be like Xiaolan when we tell stories, then it is not telling stories, but singing lullabies.

    In addition to telling stories vividly, interestingly, and suitable for children's understanding, the time used should also be paid attention to. It should not be too long. If the time is too long, children will easily get tired. Their attention will not be focused.

    When telling stories, pay attention to correct pronunciation, clear enunciation, and appropriate speed. It should not be too fast, so that children have the opportunity to think. At the same time, pay attention to avoiding grammatical errors and use the correct expressions of Mandarin. Make children get cultivated and enriched in morality and knowledge, and feel happy in spirit through listening to stories. At the same time, it is also a good way to learn how to use the language of the motherland.

Post-editor's note
    Dear readers, dear parents, what are your thoughts after reading these articles on today's page? Perhaps you will say:
  "The kindergarten teachers are really amazing and worthy of respect!" Yes, we should respect those kindergarten teachers who enable more women to leave the family due to their labor, and should care about and support their work. More importantly, we must learn from their spirit of loving the next generation and loving the collective cause, learn from their noble style of being considerate to children and parents, and put this spirit and this style into all our work.

### 怎样给学龄前儿童讲故事

    怎样给学龄前儿童讲故事
    孙敬修
    三八国际妇女节就要到了。我想送给母亲们和保育工作者们一件小小的礼物，就是根据我的点滴经验来谈谈如何对学龄前儿童讲故事。在我们生活中，常常会碰到这样的情况：孩子仰着可爱的笑脸，向我们请求：“您给我讲个故事啊！”或是用两只小手举着一本书，“您给我讲讲！”这时，做母亲的或是作保育工作的同志们是无法拒绝的；何况通过故事向儿童进行教育，是个很好的办法呢。
    讲一些有关当前政治生活的故事，社会上的新人新事，和一些优美的童话，不仅可以丰富儿童的知识，启发儿童的思维能力；更重要的还可以培养他们对祖国对人民的热爱，促使我们的新的一代的心灵能够更健康地成长起来，这是多么重要的事啊！但是要想真能达到教育的目的，同时又使儿童满意爱听，必须故事选得合适，讲得生动。故事内容应该力求简单明了易懂，讲的时候要绘形绘声，叫儿童一听，如见其人，如闻其声，这样才行。
    讲故事的时候要根据儿童的理解能力，使用他能够理解的语汇，用口语化的说法才行，否则他听不懂，就不愿意听了。口语化就是话怎么说就怎么讲。别照着书本上的文字背给孩子听，也别照着书本一字不动地念，因为不是教他背书，是给他讲故事。至于教小歌谣、短诗，按着字来教，那是另一件事了。
    有实物或是有图画的儿童读物，可以一面指着实物或图画，一面讲。讲时要把书上的说明加一些补充，把学龄前儿童不能理解的话说得通俗易懂些。
    讲的当中可以向儿童发问，使儿童有发表意见的机会。比如问：“你说这样做对吗？”“为什么？”这样儿童可以通过思考更好地理解故事内容，同时也可以吸引他们的注意，引起他们的兴趣。
    讲的时候要有表情。在手势上，声调上，脸上，都要有表情。自然不要求我们讲故事像演员在舞台上演戏似的。只要我们能按着故事中人物的动作思想感情，用我们的手式声调和面部的表情表达出来，使儿童能够很清楚的听懂，明了谁是谁非也就行了。
    跟儿童讲故事，可能会遇到这样的情况：讲着讲着，儿童有的说起话来了，有的不愿意听站起来了，或者有的注意力不集中了、东瞧西看。遇到这种情况，千万不可向儿童发怒，也不可下命令：“别说话！”“别闹！”“好好坐着！”这样效果不会好。强迫命令儿童听故事，那儿童满心的不愉快，还谈得到什么教育目的？若是我们也不管，还讲我们的，这样的做法当然也要不得。怎么办呢？必须想办法把儿童的注意力吸引回来。可以利用故事中人物的对话，或是故事中的音响效果，给儿童一种听觉上的刺激，引起他新的注意。譬如你说：“呀！小白兔正往前走，忽然来了一只大灰狼。你说怎么办呢！”“嘿！你说怎么好啊？”“就听咕通一声！”在说的时候，我们加强语气，对着那个说话的和精神不集中的儿童说，向他看，或用手一指，在说的时候，再利用我们手的动作表情，就很自然地把儿童的注意力抓住。这样既不影响故事进行，也不使儿童感到难为情。
    有的同志没有这个经验，遇到儿童不安静就着急：“看你们这闹劲的？坐下好好听着！瞧人家小兰多乖呀？坐在那儿一动也不动。”大伙一看，全笑起来了。原来小兰靠着小椅子睡着了。我们讲故事要叫儿童都像小兰似的，那就不是讲故事，而成了唱催眠曲了。
    吸引儿童很安心地听，除了讲的要生动有趣适合儿童的理解程度以外，用的时间也须要注意，不宜太长。时间太长，儿童容易疲乏。注意力也就不集中了。
    讲故事说话要注意发音正确、吐字清楚、快慢合适。不宜太快，要使儿童有思维的机会，同时要注意避免语病，要运用普通话的正确说法。使儿童通过听故事，除了在品德上、知识上得到培养丰富，精神上感到愉快，同时在运用祖国的语言上，也是一个很好的学习。编后小语
    亲爱的读者们，亲爱的家长们，当你们读了今天版面上的这些稿件以后，你们有什么感想呢？也许你们会说：
  “保育员同志真是了不起，值得敬佩！”是的，我们应该敬佩那些由于自己的劳动而使更多的妇女能够走出家庭的保育员同志们，应该关心和支持她们的工作。更重要的，是要学习她们热爱下一代、热爱集体事业的精神，学习她们对孩子、对家长体贴入微的崇高风格，并且把这种精神，这种风格，放在我们的一切工作上。
