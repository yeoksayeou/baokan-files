    Police-People Relations as Close as Family
    Public Security System's Love-the-People Month Campaign Concludes Successfully
    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: The Public Security System's 1960 Love-the-People Month campaign in our country has concluded successively in most parts of the country. This year's Love-the-People Month campaign was carried out vigorously, and a new atmosphere of police loving the people and the people helping the police has emerged everywhere. This movement has had a profound impact on promoting our country's public security organs to rely on the people forever, follow the mass line, and further strengthen the power of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    This year's Love-the-People Month campaign in the public security system began successively around New Year's Day and has lasted for two to three months so far. Most provinces and cities have concluded, while regions that started later, such as Guangxi, Hubei, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Anhui, are still carrying it out in depth. Participants in this movement include leading cadres at all levels and members of the vast grassroots public security and defense committees, which is the biggest feature of this year's Love-the-People Month campaign.
    Through this movement, all localities have concentrated on educating the vast numbers of cadres and police officers about loving the people and observing discipline, generally focusing on the eight major disciplines and ten points for attention of public security personnel. They mobilized the masses to examine the shortcomings of public security personnel and carry out criticism and self-criticism. A very small number of public security personnel with shortcomings in their thinking and work style sincerely accepted the criticism from the masses, and some even visited residents who made suggestions to make self-criticisms. In this way, the Love-the-People Month campaign actually became an open-door rectification movement for public security personnel.
    During the movement, public security personnel in various localities generally launched a surge of doing good deeds for the masses. According to statistics from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, a total of more than 121.1 million good deeds were done for the masses during this year's Love-the-People Month campaign, which is more than thirty times the total number of good deeds done by public security personnel for the masses in 1959. In the upsurge of doing good deeds, a large number of moving events emerged in various places, and the masses warmly praised public security personnel as "good police officers of the people," "good children of the Party," and "good cadres sent by Chairman Mao." Many roads, canals, and bridges built with the help of public security personnel were named "Police-People Friendship Road," "Love-the-People Road," "Love-the-People Canal," and "Love-the-People Bridge" by the masses. Because the Love-the-People Month campaign in various localities was closely integrated with the Party's central work, production, and the business of public security departments, they mostly participated in winter plowing and fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, short-distance transportation, afforestation, road construction, and winter safety inspections when doing good deeds for the masses. According to statistics from the public security organs in Hebei Province, public security personnel throughout the province accumulated more than 140 million catties of fertilizer, chopped more than 520,000 catties of firewood, planted more than 170,000 trees, and carried out more than 130,000 short-distance transportation trips during the movement. In addition, they also built many roads and small-scale water conservancy projects. These activities not only enriched the content of doing good deeds but also supported the country's construction. The Love-the-People Month campaign strengthened the ties between public security organs and the people, thus greatly arousing the masses' enthusiasm for fighting the enemy. Some people took the initiative to report situations and expose bad people and bad deeds to the police, and assist public security organs in solving cases. Wang Qingyuan, a resident of Luoyang City, suddenly discovered one day that Wei Fengtong, a counter-revolutionary who had been on the run for more than ten years, had returned to Luoyang. He immediately reported to the police station and arrested the counter-revolutionary. In Wuzhi, Huaxian, and Changyuan counties in Xinxiang Prefecture, the masses helped public security organs solve sixty-five cases during the Love-the-People Month campaign, and achieved great victories in the struggle against the enemy in a very short period of time.

    警民关系亲密如同家人
    公安系统爱民月运动胜利结束
    据新华社26日讯　我国公安系统1960年的爱民月运动，已在全国绝大部分地区先后结束。今年的爱民月运动开展得轰轰烈烈，各地普遍出现了警爱民，民帮警的新气象。这个运动对于促使我国公安机关永远依靠人民，大走群众路线，进一步加强人民民主专政的威力，发生了深远的影响。
    今年公安系统的爱民月运动，从元旦前后相继开始，到目前经历两、三个月的时间，绝大多数省、市已经结束，广西、湖北、甘肃、新疆、安徽等开展较晚的地区正在深入进行。投入这个运动的包括有各级领导干部和广大的基层治安保卫委员会的委员，这是今年爱民月运动最大的特色。
    通过这次运动，各地集中地对广大干部和民警进行了爱人民、守纪律的教育，普遍以公安人员的八大纪律和十项注意为中心内容，发动群众检查公安人员的缺点，开展批评和自我批评。极少数思想作风上有缺点的公安人员，都诚恳地接受了群众的批评，有的还登门向提意见的居民作了检讨。这样，爱民月运动实际上变成了公安人员一次开门整风的运动。
    在运动中，各地公安人员普遍掀起了为群众大办好事的热潮。据二十七个省、市、自治区的统计，在今年爱民月运动中共为群众办好事达一亿二千一百多万件，超过了1959年公安人员为群众办好事总数的三十倍。在大办好事的热潮中，各地涌现出大量动人事例，群众热烈称赞公安人员是“人民的好警察”，“党的好儿女”，“毛主席派来的好干部”。许多由公安人员帮助修筑的道路、水渠和桥梁，被群众命名为“警民友谊路”、“爱民路”、“爱民渠”、“爱民桥”。由于各地爱民月运动密切地结合党的中心工作，结合生产，结合公安部门的业务，他们在为群众办好事时，大都投入了冬耕积肥、兴修水利、短途运输、造林、筑路和冬季安全大检查的活动。据河北省公安机关的统计，全省公安人员在运动中共为群众积肥一亿四千多万斤，打柴五十二万多斤，植树十七万多株，搞短途运输十三万多次，另外还兴修了很多道路和小型水利工程。这些活动不仅丰富了办好事的内容，而且支援了国家的建设。爱民月运动加强了公安机关同人民群众的联系，因而大大激发了群众对敌斗争的积极性，有的人主动向民警反映情况，检举坏人坏事，协助公安机关侦破案件。洛阳市的居民王清原，有一天忽然发现外逃十余年的反革命分子魏凤同返回洛阳，当时立即向派出所报告，将这个反革命分子抓获。在新乡专区武陟、滑县、长垣三个县，群众在爱民月运动中，帮助公安机关破获了六十五起案件，在很短时间内就取得了对敌斗争很大的胜利。
