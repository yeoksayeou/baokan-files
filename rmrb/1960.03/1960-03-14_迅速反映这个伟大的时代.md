    Rapidly Reflect This Great Era
    Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China
    The event of rescuing sixty-one class brothers in Pinglu is an inevitable product of the great Mao Zedong era. It fully embodies the high communist style and magnificent spiritual outlook of our people. Only this high degree of communist thought and style can enable us to overcome dangers as if walking on smooth ground, be indestructible, build socialism at high speed, and march forward to communism in the future without stopping. The communist ideas reflected in the "Pinglu Incident" are powerfully promoting the people of Shanxi Province and all of China, promoting the broad masses of young people across the country to rapidly raise their communist consciousness, develop communist collaboration, and further accelerate the pace of construction. Imperialists and modern revisionists are accustomed to using the signboard of bourgeois humanitarianism, nonsensically claiming that the Chinese Communist Party is "inhuman," "lacking in human feelings," "violating humanism," and so on. The Pinglu Incident will best use the Party and the People's Government's deepest and most meticulous care for the working people to smash their shameless slanders and expose their hypocritical masks.
    Now, inspired by this glorious event, the comrades of the China Youth Art Theater and the Experimental Theater of the Central Academy of Drama, with soaring energy and fully developing the spirit of communist collaboration, completed the work from script writing to performance in just a few days, bringing this event to the stage. We warmly congratulate them on the success of their performance. We believe that their performance will give the people and youth of the whole country a profound communist education. For all drama workers, this is also an example of literature and art serving proletarian politics and thoroughly implementing the mass line in creation. The Beijing Film Studio has now begun shooting an artistic documentary "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" and is preparing to screen it soon, which is also a very good thing. We also believe that our literary workers, music workers, art workers, and dance workers can catch up quickly and write this moving theme into the most beautiful poems, compose the most beautiful songs, paint the most beautiful paintings, and create the most beautiful dances to express the heroic image of our country's advanced figures in the great Mao Zedong era, to inspire the people and youth of the whole country to build socialism and march towards communism with even more vigor.

    迅速反映这个伟大的时代
    中华人民共和国文化部副部长　钱俊瑞
    抢救平陆六十一个阶级弟兄的事件是伟大的毛泽东时代的必然的产物。它充分地体现出我国人民群众的高度的共产主义风格和瑰丽的精神面貌。只有这种高度的共产主义思想和风格才能使我们履险如夷，无坚不摧，高速度地建设社会主义，并且在将来马不停蹄地向共产主义跃进。“平陆事件”所反映出来的共产主义思想，正有力地推动着山西省和全中国人民，推动全国广大青年迅速提高自己的共产主义觉悟，发展共产主义大协作，更加加速建设步伐。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者惯用资产阶级的人道主义的招牌，胡说什么中国共产党“灭绝人性”、“不讲人情”、“违反人道”等等。平陆事件将最好地用党和人民政府对于劳动人民最深切的和无微不至的关怀来粉碎他们无耻的污蔑，揭穿他们伪善的画皮。
    现在，在这一辉煌事件的感召下，中国青年艺术剧院和中央戏剧学院实验话剧院的同志们用冲天的干劲，充分发扬共产主义的协作精神，在短短几天的时间里，完成了从剧本编写到演出的工作，把这一事件搬上舞台。我们热烈祝贺他们演出的成功。我们相信，他们的演出一定会给全国人民和青年以深刻的共产主义教育。对全体戏剧工作者来说，这也是文学艺术为无产阶级政治服务和在创作中彻底贯彻群众路线的一个榜样。北京电影制片厂现在已经开始拍摄“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的艺术纪录片，并且准备在最近放映，这同样是非常好的事情。我们也相信我们的文学工作者、音乐工作者、美术工作者、舞蹈工作者们，都能急起直追，把这一动人的题材写成最美的诗篇，编成最美的歌曲，画成最美的画图，编成最美的舞蹈，来表现伟大毛泽东时代的我国先进人物的英雄形象，来鼓舞全国人民和青年，更加意气风发地建设社会主义、奔向共产主义。
