The National On-site Conference on Finance, Banking, and Enterprise Financial Work in Large and Medium-sized Cities, convened in Shanghai by the Finance and Trade Department of the CPC Central Committee, summarized and exchanged the experiences of Shanghai and other cities in adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and closely cooperating with all parties in financial and banking work and enterprise financial work to support and promote the high-speed development of the national economy. These experiences were created by the vast number of employees in China's financial, banking, and enterprise financial departments under the glorious guidance of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and in the Great Leap Forward of the national economy. Summarizing and universally promoting these experiences can push the financial and banking work and enterprise financial work of China's large and medium-sized cities to a new stage of development, and can more powerfully promote the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, further achieving the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Socialist financial, banking, and enterprise financial departments are tools used by the state to organize revenue and allocate funds to ensure continuous expanded reproduction and improve people's living standards. Their primary task is to serve expanded reproduction. Production is the foundation of social and economic activity. Production determines distribution, and distribution in turn affects production. Only when production develops and products increase can accumulation and consumption increase. At the same time, financial, banking, and enterprise financial work is not passive or reactive. Doing this work well also has a counter-promotion effect on production. Opening up financial resources and increasing income from the development of production; increased income in turn promotes the development of production. According to the Party's policies, on the basis of production development, more income, more expenditure, more construction, more income, more expenditure, more construction, such a cyclical and spiral upward movement, is the correct path for financial credit to promote the high-speed and proportionate development of the national economy. Therefore, actively and proactively participating in production, organizing production, and doing everything possible to serve the high-speed development of production have become the fundamental tasks of financial, monetary, and enterprise financial work. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "County and district Party and government workers should devote 90 percent of their energy to helping farmers increase production in financial and economic matters, and then use 10 percent of their energy to obtain taxes from farmers. If you work hard on the former, the latter will be easy." The principle put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong is not only applicable to the past, applicable to rural areas, but also applicable to the present, applicable to the future, and applicable to cities. At present, more than 90% of our country's fiscal revenue comes from the payments of state-owned enterprises, and more than 60% of fiscal expenditure is used for economic construction; the vast majority of the state bank's credit funds are also lent to enterprises for expanding production and expanding commodity circulation. State-owned enterprises are the main departments for capital accumulation, capital distribution and use. Financial and banking staff in cities, and financial staff in enterprises, must walk out of their offices, go deep into enterprise production, go deep into the masses of workers, actively assist enterprises in organizing production well, allocating and using funds and materials well, tapping the potential of funds and materials, and giving full play to the role of funds and materials. Going deep into production, using 90% of the energy to assist enterprises in organizing production well, and working hard to assist enterprises in developing production, actually creates conditions for doing a good job in the "collection, expenditure, storage, and lending" work of their own departments. It can be said that financial and banking staff, and enterprise financial staff, are concerned about production and construction, which means they are concerned about their own business. Actively participating in production and helping enterprises organize production will not only not hinder the work of revenue, expenditure, storage and lending, but is precisely the prerequisite for doing a good job.

So, how should financial, banking, and enterprise financial departments participate in production and assist enterprises in organizing production? The experiences of Shanghai and other cities show that the road for them to participate in production and promote production is very broad, and the methods are also diverse, among which the three main ones are: using the method of economic activity analysis to help enterprises tap production potential, tap the potential of materials and funds; combining internal and external forces, and cooperating with all parties to help enterprises organize active balance; helping enterprises carry out mass-based team economic accounting activities, so that the masses of workers consciously care about the economic effects of their labor.

Economic activity analysis is an important method for tapping production potential. Economic activity analysis is to compare and analyze various economic data such as output, quality, cost, materials, and funds, between plans and actual results, between the present and the past, between factories and factories, between workshops and workshops, and between teams and teams, to find the gap between the advanced and the backward. Where there is a gap, there is a contradiction. When contradictions are found, the potential is found. Financial and monetary departments and enterprise financial departments also had economic activity analysis in the past, but in the past, it was mainly from a financial point of view, and it was done by a few people in the financial department sitting in the office. The result of the analysis may sometimes raise some questions, but it is only raising questions, without further studying how to solve the problem politically and economically. This is not surprising, because sitting in the office, looking at problems purely from a financial point of view, being isolated from production and from the masses of workers, it is of course difficult to understand why the advanced are advanced and why the backward are backward. Knowing only what it is, but not knowing why it is, the advanced things cannot be developed, and the backward things cannot be overcome, and the economic activity analysis has not played its due role in promoting production. Now it is different. Economic activity analysis should start from promoting production. Financial and banking personnel and enterprise financial personnel go out of the office, go deep into the enterprise, go deep into the site, go deep into the masses, and observe, analyze, and discover problems from the production process. After finding the gap, we must also work with the production workers to find out the reasons, think of solutions, and solve the contradictions, so that the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become more advanced. Through this method of "comparing the advanced, finding the gap, tapping the potential, and catching up with the advanced", helping enterprises to discover problems and solve problems will powerfully promote the development of labor competition, fully mobilize the labor enthusiasm of workers, and continuously promote the overall leap forward in production.

The socialist economy is a planned and proportionate development economy, and all departments of the national economy carry out their work according to the unified plan of the state. In the process of high-speed development of the national economy, whether it is the national plan, the departmental plan, the local plan, or the plan of an enterprise, it is always constantly broken through by the leap forward of production, and new imbalances often appear. This requires cooperation between the national economic departments and various enterprises to actively organize new balances to promote the high-speed development of the national economy. The financial and banking department is a comprehensive department, which has contacts with various departments, enterprises, and units. When an enterprise has insufficient raw materials, insufficient funds, or needs to solve certain technical problems, the financial and monetary department should make full use of its characteristics of having a wide range of contacts and knowing a lot about the situation, and under the principle of the whole country being a chess game, under the leadership of the Party committee, take the initiative to adopt the methods of "linking", "bridging", and "needle and thread", and through cooperation with all parties, assist enterprises in solving difficulties. Through such great collaboration, it can not only adjust the surplus and deficiency of materials and play a major role in the national plan balance; it can also organize the exchange of experience and technology to help backward units catch up with advanced units. By organizing such cooperation, it can not only tap the potential of enterprises and give full play to the maximum efficiency of materials, but also save funds, reduce costs, increase accumulation, and at the same time, greatly promote the communist style and improve people's mental outlook.

Socialist financial and banking staff and enterprise financial staff must do a good job in economic accounting. Socialist economic accounting, under the principle of adhering to the command of politics, requires the maximum saving of living labor and materialized labor, so that the use of materials and funds is reasonable, and labor productivity is fully improved. To do a good job in socialist economic accounting, we must use the method of walking on two legs, combining the economic accounting of professional personnel with the economic accounting of the masses. In socialist enterprises, the masses of workers are ordinary laborers, and at the same time, they are the masters of the enterprise. They are not only actively producing, but also very concerned about the results of their labor, so they should be absorbed to participate in the management of production and participate in economic accounting. Workers said well: "If you are in charge of the household, you must manage the household. If you manage the household, you must do accounting. If you don't do accounting, you are in charge of a muddled household." Team economic accounting is an important content of workers' participation in enterprise management, and it is a mass movement with rich political and economic content. Through participating in the actual activity of economic accounting, the masses of workers can further give play to their enthusiasm as masters, and improve their production knowledge and production skills. After the workers of Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory learned that diamonds were not easy to come by, and one grain was worth more than 500 yuan, they took the initiative to save and take less, and carried out technical innovation to replace diamonds with abrasive wheel chucks, reducing costs. After Benxi Steel Plant implemented pre-furnace accounting, it announced the prices of raw materials, and the workers automatically came up with ways to save raw materials, and on the premise of ensuring product quality, saved the country more than 1,000 yuan per ton of raw materials. The workers said: "Why didn't you tell us earlier? If we had known the price of materials earlier, we would have saved the country more money." These facts show that the workers' participation in economic accounting is not only to calculate the savings account, but also to calculate the comprehensive leap forward account of more, faster, better, and more economical; it is not only to calculate the economic account, but also to calculate the political account; it is not to execute the accounting system in isolation, but to actively promote the development of technical innovation and technical revolution movement through the method of accounting. Therefore, team accounting is the basis of enterprise economic accounting. Only by doing a good job in team economic accounting can we do a good job in the economic accounting of financial professionals. Financial, banking, and enterprise financial staff must, under the leadership of the Party committee of the enterprise, undertake the task of organizing and guiding the mass team economic accounting, so that the mass economic accounting and the professional economic accounting promote each other and improve together.

For financial, banking, and enterprise financial work to better serve the promotion of production, the most fundamental issue is to closely rely on the leadership of the Party and to carry out work frequently around the central tasks of the Party in various periods. The central tasks of the Party in various periods reflect the urgent demands of the broad masses of people and are the political direction of the country in a certain period. Obeying the central work of the Party means obeying the leadership of the Party. Leaving the central work of the Party will inevitably lead to separation from the masses, separation from production, separation from politics, lack of energy, and coldness. Only by carrying out work closely around the center of the Party can we get the support of the masses, can we raise the business work of the department to the level of political work and mass work, and make the work lively and colorful. Of course, serving the central work of the Party and carrying out mass movements in a big way does not mean that the necessary and reasonable rules and regulations in finance, banking, and finance can be ignored. We should, under the leadership of the Party committee, rely on the consciousness of the broad masses of people to implement reasonable rules and regulations so that economic work becomes more and more meticulous.

At present, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being widely and deeply carried out on various fronts. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the fundamental way to ensure the continued leap forward this year, and it is also the decisive link for the high-speed and sustained development of socialist production and construction. All employees of the national financial, banking, and enterprise financial departments must establish a firm production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and political viewpoint, and under the leadership of the Party, actively participate in and support this national technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and more powerfully promote the leap forward development of production and construction!

    财政金融部门促进生产的途径
    中共中央财贸部在上海召开的全国大中城市财政、银行、企业财务工作现场会议，总结和交流了上海等城市在财政银行工作和企业财务工作中，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，同各方面密切协作，支援和促进国民经济高速度发展的经验。这些经验，是我国财政、银行和企业财务部门的广大职工，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在国民经济大跃进中所创造的。总结和普遍推广这些经验，就可以把我国大中城市的财政银行工作、企业财务工作推向一个新的发展阶段，就可以更有力地推动增产节约运动的开展，进一步达到又多又快又好又省的要求。
    社会主义的财政、银行和企业财务部门，是国家用来组织收入和分配资金，以保证不断扩大再生产和提高人民生活的工具。它们的首要任务是为扩大再生产服务。生产是社会经济活动的基础。生产决定分配，分配又影响生产。只有生产发展了，产品增加了，才能增加积累，增加消费。同时，财政、银行和企业财务工作也不是消极的被动的。把这些工作做好了，对生产也有促进的反作用。从发展生产中开辟财源，增加收入；收入增加了，回头来又推动生产的发展。按照党的方针政策，在生产发展的基础上，多收入，多支出，多建设，更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设，如此循环往复、螺旋式地上升运动，这是财政信贷促进国民经济高速度按比例发展的正确道路。因此，积极地主动地参与生产，组织生产，千方百计地为促进生产的高速度发展服务，就成为财政、金融和企业财务工作的根本任务。早在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志就说过：“县区党政工作人员在财政经济问题上，应以百分之九十的精力帮助农民增加生产，然后以百分之十的精力从农民取得税收。对前者用了苦功，对后者便轻而易举。”毛泽东同志提出的这个原则，不仅适用于过去，适用于农村，而且也适用于现在，适用于将来，适用于城市。现在，我们国家的90％以上财政收入，来自国营企业的缴款，60％以上的财政支出用于经济建设；国家银行的信贷资金，绝大部分也是贷给企业用于扩大生产和扩大商品流通。国营企业是资金积累、资金分配和使用的主要部门。城市的财政、银行工作人员，企业的财务工作人员，必须走出办公室，深入到企业生产中去，深入到职工群众中去，积极协助企业把生产组织好，把资金和物资分配好，使用好，挖掘资金和物资的潜力，充分发挥资金和物资的作用。深入生产，用90％的精力协助企业组织好生产，在协助企业发展生产上面下了苦功，实际上也就是为做好本部门的“收、支、存、贷”工作创造了条件。可以这样说，财政银行工作人员、企业财务工作人员，关心生产建设，就是关心自己的业务。积极参与生产和帮助企业组织生产，不但不会妨碍收支存贷业务，而且正是做好业务工作的前提。
    财政、银行和企业财务部门，应当怎样参与生产，怎样协助企业组织生产的呢？上海等城市的经验表明，他们参与生产、促进生产的道路是十分宽广的，办法也是多种多样的，而其中最主要的有三条。这就是运用经济活动分析的方法，帮助企业挖掘生产潜力，挖掘物资和资金的潜力；内外结合，协作各方，帮助企业组织积极的平衡；帮助企业开展群众性的班组经济核算运动，使职工群众自觉地关心自己劳动的经济效果。
    经济活动分析，是挖掘生产潜力的重要方法。经济活动分析，就是通过产量、质量、成本、物资、资金等各种经济资料，从计划与实绩、现在与过去、工厂与工厂、车间与车间、班组与班组之间，进行比较分析，找出先进和落后的差距。有差距，就有矛盾。找到了矛盾，就找到了潜力所在。财政金融部门、企业财务部门，过去也有经济活动分析，但过去主要是从财务出发，由财务科室的少数人坐在办公室里搞的。分析的结果有时可能提出些问题，但也仅仅是提出问题，没有从政治上经济上进一步去研究如何解决问题。这也难怪，因为坐在办公室里，单纯从财务的角度看问题，跟生产隔绝，跟职工群众隔绝，当然难以了解先进的为什么先进，落后的为什么落后。只知其然，不知其所以然，先进的东西就得不到发扬，落后的东西就得不到克服，经济活动分析就没有起到应有的促进生产的作用。现在不同了，经济活动分析要从促进生产出发，财政银行和企业财务人员走出了办公室，深入企业，深入现场，深入群众，从生产过程中观察、分析、发现问题。找出了差距，还要和生产职工一道，查明原因，想出办法，解决矛盾，使落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进。通过这种“比先进、找差距、挖潜力、赶先进”的方法，帮助企业发现问题，解决问题，就有力地推动劳动竞赛的开展，充分地调动工人的劳动积极性，不断地推动生产的全面跃进。
    社会主义经济是有计划按比例发展的经济，国民经济各部门都按照国家的统一计划来进行自己的工作。在国民经济高速度发展过程中，无论是国家计划、部门计划、地方计划，或者是一个企业的计划，总是经常不断地被生产的跃进所突破，经常出现新的不平衡。这就需要通过国民经济部门、各企业之间进行协作，积极组织新的平衡，以促进国民经济的高速度发展。财政银行部门是一个综合性部门，同各部门、各企业、各单位都有联系。当企业发生原材料不足，资金不足，或者需要解决某些技术问题的时候，财政金融部门应当充分利用自己联系面较广、了解情况较多的特点，根据全国一盘棋的原则，在国家计划指导下，在党委的领导下，主动地采取“挂钩”、“搭桥”、“穿针引线”的办法，通过同各方协作，协助企业解决困难。通过这样的大协作，不仅可以调剂物资的余缺，在国家计划平衡方面发挥重大作用；也可以组织经验和技术的交流，帮助落后单位赶上先进单位。通过组织这样的协作，不仅可以挖掘企业的潜力，充分发挥物资的最大效能，而且可以节约资金，降低成本，增加积累，同时，大大发扬共产主义的风格，改善人们的精神面貌。
    社会主义的财政银行工作人员，企业财务工作人员必须做好经济核算的工作。社会主义的经济核算，在坚持政治挂帅的原则下，要求最大限度地节约活的劳动力和物化的劳动，使物资、资金使用得合理，充分提高劳动生产率。要做好社会主义经济核算，必须用两条腿走路的办法，把专业人员的经济核算同群众性的经济核算结合起来。在社会主义企业里，工人群众是一个普通的劳动者，同时又是企业的主人。他们不但积极生产，而且很关心自己的劳动成果，因此应当吸收他们参加管理生产，参加经济核算。工人说得好：“当家必管家，管家必核算，如果不核算，当的糊涂家”。班组经济核算，是工人参加企业管理的一个重要内容，是一个有着丰富的政治内容和经济内容的群众运动。职工群众通过参加经济核算这个实际活动，就能够进一步发挥当家作主的积极性，提高生产知识和生产技能。成都量具刃具厂的工人在知道金刚石来源不易，一粒要值五百多元以后，就主动节约少领，并且开展技术革新，以打砂轮卡具代金刚石，降低了成本。本溪钢厂实行了炉前核算后，把原料材料价格公布，工人就自动想出节约原料材料的办法，在保证产品质量的前提下，每吨原材料为国家节约差价一千余元。工人说：“为什么不早告诉我们，要是早知道材料价格，就会给国家省下更多的钱了”。这些事实说明，工人参加经济核算，不仅是算节约账，而且要算多快好省的全面跃进账；不仅算经济账，而且算政治账；不是孤立地执行核算制度，而是通过核算的方法，积极推动技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。所以，班组核算是企业经济核算的基础，做好了班组经济核算，才能做好财务专业人员的经济核算。财政、银行和企业财务的工作人员，必须在企业的党委领导下，把组织和指导群众性的班组经济核算任务担当起来，使群众性的经济核算和专业人员的经济核算互相促进，共同提高。
    财政、银行和企业财务工作要更好地为促进生产服务，最根本的问题在于紧紧依靠党的领导，经常地围绕着党在各个时期的中心任务进行工作。党在各个时期的中心任务，集中地反映着广大人民的迫切要求，是国家在一定时期的政治方向。服从党的中心工作，就是服从党的领导。离开了党的中心工作，必然是脱离群众，脱离生产，脱离政治，有气没力，冷冷清清。只有紧紧围绕党的中心开展工作，才能得到群众的支持，才能使部门业务工作提高到政治工作、群众工作的水平上来，使工作进行得生动活泼，有声有色。当然，为党的中心工作服务，大搞群众运动，并不是说可以忽视财政、银行、财务方面的必要的合理规章制度。我们应当在党委的领导下，依靠广大群众的自觉，贯彻执行合理的规章制度，使经济工作越做越细致。
    现在，一个以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在各个战线上广泛而深入地开展起来。技术革新和技术革命运动，是保证今年继续跃进的根本道路，也是高速度地持续地发展社会主义生产和建设的决定性环节。全国财政、银行、企业财务部门的全体职工，一定要树立坚强的生产观点、群众观点、政治观点，在党的领导下，积极参与和支持这个全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动，更加有力地促进生产和建设的飞跃发展！
