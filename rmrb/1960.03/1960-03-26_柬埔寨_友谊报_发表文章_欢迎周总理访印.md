Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 24th. Cambodian "Friendship News" expressed on the 24th its welcome to Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to New Delhi to meet with Prime Minister Nehru. It pointed out that this is a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the policy of peace.

	It said, "All neutral countries and peace-loving people hope that the meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru will achieve great success."

	The newspaper said that imperialists had used the Sino-Indian border issue to oppose People's China and the policy of neutrality, and some right-wingers in India also demanded that Nehru abandon the policy of neutrality. The imperialists attempted to use this opportunity to make neutral countries abandon the policy of peaceful coexistence with all countries.

	The newspaper said that, however, Nehru and the Indian people did not abandon the policy of neutrality. The facts that the Sino-Burmese border issue and the Indonesian Chinese issue were resolved through negotiations show that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the policy of peace are unshakable, and point out ways to resolve Sino-Indian disputes.

    柬埔寨“友谊报”发表文章
    欢迎周总理访印
    新华社金边24日电　柬埔寨“友谊报”24日表示欢迎周恩来总理即将访问新德里同尼赫鲁总理会晤。它指出，这是和平共处五项原则和和平政策的胜利。
    它说，“所有中立国家和爱好和平的人民希望周恩来和尼赫鲁的会晤将取得巨大的成就。”
    这家报纸说，帝国主义曾经利用中印边界问题来反对人民中国和中立政策，印度有些右派也要求尼赫鲁放弃中立政策。帝国主义者企图利用这个机会使中立国家放弃同各国的和平共处的政策。
    这家报纸说，但是，尼赫鲁和印度人民并没有放弃中立政策。中缅边界问题和印度尼西亚华侨问题通过谈判得到解决这些事实说明，和平共处五项原则和和平政策是不可动摇的，并且指出了解决中印争端的办法。
