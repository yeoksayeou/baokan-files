Xinhua News Agency, March 7th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese newspapers generally attach importance to Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru, believing that a meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers will help resolve the Sino-Indian border issue.

The "Akahata," organ of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out on March 1st that because Premier Zhou Enlai agreed in his reply to Prime Minister Nehru on February 26th to hold talks in Delhi, "the Sino-Indian border dispute has greatly advanced in the direction of a negotiated solution." It said, "This summit meeting was initially proposed in Premier Zhou's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th last year."

The "Asahi Shimbun" said on February 29th, "The Sino-Indian border dispute problem has finally revealed a clue to a solution due to Zhou Enlai's letter on February 26th." It also believes that the Sino-Indian border issue "has largely embarked on the track of negotiation, which is of tremendous significance."

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" believed on February 29th that the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers had reached a consensus on holding talks, which "can be said to be a major step forward by both sides in the direction of resolving the dispute."

The "Mainichi Shimbun" and "Tokyo Shimbun" also held the same view, believing that due to Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru, the Sino-Indian border dispute has moved closer to a resolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 7th: Toronto dispatch: "The Canadian Forum" published an article today commenting on the upcoming meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru, saying, "Many observers believe that this is a setback for all those who are trying to use border disputes to alienate the billion people of India and China - like the US State Department and right-wing diehards in India."

The article, written by the newspaper's Beijing correspondent, Sidney Gordon, wrote, "Although hostile foreign propaganda has portrayed China as launching a campaign to invade the Indian frontier, it has actually launched 'a campaign of peace and friendship' towards India."

The article pointed out that a peaceful settlement of the Sino-Indian border dispute through negotiations "has long been an openly declared goal of Chinese policy." "In the face of the most provocative and unfounded accusations, China has steadfastly maintained that it wants friendship with India and that direct negotiations are the only way to resolve the issue."

The author also pointed out that "some diehards in India seem to be engaged in a frantic campaign to sabotage the negotiations before they even begin."

    日本和加拿大一些报纸认为
    周总理复信有助解决中印边界问题
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本各报普遍重视周恩来总理给尼赫鲁总理的复信，认为中印两国总理会晤有助于解决中印边界问题。
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”1日指出，由于周恩来总理在2月26日复信尼赫鲁总理同意在德里举行会谈，“中印边界争端已经向协商解决的方向大大前进了一步。”它说，“这种首脑会谈是去年11月7日周总理给尼赫鲁总理的信中最初提出的。”
      “朝日新闻”2月29日说，“中印边界纷争问题由于2月26日周恩来的信件，总算露出了解决问题的端倪。”它还认为，中印边界问题“大体已经走上谈判的轨道，这是具有非常巨大的意义的”。
    “读卖新闻”2月29日认为，中印两国总理在举行会谈问题上取得了一致意见，这“可以说，双方都向解决争端的方向大大前进了一步”。
    “每日新闻”和“东京新闻”也持同样的看法，认为由于周恩来总理给尼赫鲁总理的复信，中印边界争端已经向解决问题接近了一步。
    新华社日内瓦7日电　多伦多消息：“加拿大论坛报”今天发表文章评论周恩来总理将同尼赫鲁总理会晤说，“许多观察家认为，这是所有竭力指望用边界纠纷来离间印、中两国十亿人民的那些人——像美国国务院和印度国内的右翼顽固分子——的一个挫折。”
    这家报纸驻北京记者悉尼·戈登写的这篇文章写道，“虽然外国敌意的宣传一直把中国说得好像是在发动一个侵略印度边疆的运动，但是实际上它对印度所发动的却是‘一个和平和友好的运动’。”
    文章指出，通过谈判和平解决中印边界纠纷“长期以来就是中国政策中公开宣布了的目标”。“在最富挑衅性的、毫无根据的指责面前，中国一直坚定不移地坚持认为，它希望同印度友好，而直接谈判是解决问题的唯一办法。”
    作者同时指出，“印度国内的一些顽固分子看来正在进行狂热的活动，企图在谈判开始以前就破坏这项谈判。”
