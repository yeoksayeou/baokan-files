Maternal Love

Fifty-four children live in the Xiluoyuan Nursery of the Nanyuan People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing. They are all lively and healthy, and their mothers are very satisfied.

Every mother loves her own child, and the nursery workers at Xiluoyuan Nursery love the children as much as their own mothers. Their meticulous care for the children in terms of bedding, clothing, food, and play fully embodies the great maternal love of socialism and communism.

In any society, there is maternal love, but the meaning of maternal love for children differs among people from different societies and classes. In class society, because the economic base is private ownership, children are also regarded as private property, and a mother's love for her child stems from personal desires such as hoping the child will become successful, bring honor to the family, and provide support in old age. In socialist society, as private ownership is replaced by public ownership, not only is production collectivized, but life is also gradually becoming collectivized. Especially after the people's communes were established, the vast number of women were freed from the shackles of housework and participated in productive labor, and tens of thousands of children entered nurseries, which enabled children to receive more social maternal love. This kind of maternal love can nurture children to become better successors to communism.

The childcare workers at Xiluoyuan Nursery recognize the significance of maternal love in different societies and demonstrate a high degree of communist spirit in their childcare work. This spirit is worthy of emulation by comrades engaged in childcare work.

    母爱
    五十四个孩子生活在北京丰台区南苑人民公社西罗园托儿所里，个个活泼健壮，妈妈们都很满意。
    谁家的妈妈对自己的孩子都爱，西罗园托儿所的保育员们对孩子的爱赛同妈妈。她们对孩子从铺的、盖的、穿的、吃的、玩的无微不至的照料，充分地体现了社会主义和共产主义精神的伟大母爱。
    在任何社会里，都有母爱，但不同社会不同阶级出身的人对子女的母爱含义是不同的。在阶级社会里，因为经济基础是私人所有制，孩子也被当着个人的私有财产，而母亲爱自己的孩子，是从望子成龙，显耀门庭，养儿防老等个人愿望出发。在社会主义社会里，由于私有经济被公有经济所代替，不仅生产集体化了，生活也正逐渐走向集体化。特别是人民公社化以后，广大妇女摆脱了家务的束缚，参加了生产劳动，成千上万的儿童进了托儿所，这就使孩子们能够受到更多的社会的母爱。这种母爱就可能把孩子们培养成为更好的共产主义接班人。
    西罗园托儿所的保育工作者，认识到这种不同社会的母爱意义，在保育工作中发挥了高度共产主义的精神。这种精神是值得从事保育工作的同志们学习的。
