(Dispatch from our newspaper) Cao Yixiu, a Dai ethnic rat-catching expert from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, has made new discoveries about the life habits of rats through continued research. Rat burrows generally have interconnected front and back doors. In the past, it was only known that the back doors of rats were often in hidden places, but the rules of their distribution were not understood. After a year of exploration, Cao Yixiu has found the distribution patterns of rat back doors. The general distribution position is that the place that can be exposed to sunlight at sunrise is the back door, and the place that can be exposed to sunlight at sunset is the front door. The back door is not as obviously exposed as the front door. The location of the hole is often in places where grass grows vigorously, and some have holes, while others do not. There is only a small clump of withered grass. When a stick is used to poke it, it is found that the withered grass grows on a very thin layer of soil. After Cao Yixiu further studied and mastered this rule, the rate of catching rats was greatly improved. During the autumn harvest of 1959, she personally went to various production teams to help catch rats. In just over a month during the autumn harvest, this commune caught more than 115,000 rats. From December 2nd to 20th last year, in just eighteen days, she caught more than 2,200 rats.

In the spring of 1959, the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture launched a movement to learn from Cao Yixiu's rat-catching experience and her noble qualities, which promoted the local patriotic health campaign. The Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee specially transferred cadres to accompany Cao Yixiu to go deep into the areas of the state where the work of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene was relatively weak, to explain to the masses the living habits of rats. At the same time, she caught rats on the spot and specifically taught the masses how to catch rats. Once, after she made a report in Mangshi, the capital of the Autonomous Prefecture, she immediately led more than 300 cadres and people to the fields to catch rats. In just over an hour of digging rat holes, they caught more than 350 rats. Under her specific teaching, hundreds and thousands of rat-catching activists have emerged throughout the state in the past year. Driven and influenced by Cao Yixiu, the whole state caught more than 2.8 million rats throughout the year.

Cao Yixiu is a Dai peasant woman who has not attended school and is a 67-year-old woman. She has rich knowledge of the living habits of rats. She can judge where there are rat holes, whether there are rats in the holes, and even how many rats are in the holes, based on the living habits and environment of the rats. The old woman catches rats in order to eliminate the plague. Her hometown was occupied by Japanese imperialism in 1945, and the Japanese invaders spread the plague in large quantities. Many villages died in large numbers. In 1951, the Party and the government sent prevention and control personnel to eliminate the plague. Only then did she realize that the plague was brought by rats, and to eliminate the plague, rats must be eliminated first. Since then, Cao Yixiu has been going out to work in the fields in the morning for nine years as if it was just another day, always carrying a hoe with her, paying attention to whether there were rat holes along the road, and digging them up immediately when she found them. Later, she thought that to completely eliminate rats, she must understand their living habits. Later, before each digging, she paid attention to observing the surrounding conditions and natural environment of the hole, the situation inside the hole, etc., and gradually mastered the living habits of rats. From 1951 to the present, she has eliminated more than 10,000 rats. In 1958, she went to Kunming City to give an on-site academic lecture on the living habits of rats for the medical community of Kunming, which received a very high scientific evaluation. Cao Yixiu has been elected as a member of the China Association for Science and Technology, and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has also hired her as a special researcher. Relevant health departments have also hired her as a technical consultant. Last year, she also gloriously attended the National Congress of Active Women in Socialist Construction.

    对老鼠后洞分布规律了如指掌
    曹依秀捕鼠法有了新发展
    她在十八天中捉了二千二百多只
    本报讯　云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州傣族捕鼠专家曹依秀，经过继续钻研，对老鼠的生活规律又有了新的发现。鼠洞一般都有相通的前洞和后洞。过去，只知道老鼠的后洞往往在隐蔽的地方，但不了解它分布的规律。曹依秀经过一年的摸索，已经找到了老鼠后洞的分布规律。一般的分布位置是，日出时就能照到的地方是后洞，日落时能照到的地方是前洞，后洞不像前洞那样明显暴露，洞口位置往往是在草长得旺盛的地方，而且有的有洞口，有的没有洞口，只有一小丛枯萎的草，用棍一捣就发现枯萎的草，生长在一层很薄的土层上面。曹依秀进一步研究和掌握了这一规律后，捕鼠率大大提高。1959年秋收时，她亲自到各个生产队帮助捕鼠，仅秋收时的一个多月中，这个公社就捕捉了老鼠十一万五千多只，她本人从去年12月2日到20日十八天中，就捕捉了二千二百多只老鼠。
    1959年春季，德宏傣族景颇族自治州掀起一个学习曹依秀捕鼠经验和她的高尚品质的运动，使当地爱国卫生运动向前发展了一步。自治州党委专门抽调干部陪同曹依秀深入到全州除四害、讲卫生工作较薄弱的地方，向群众讲演老鼠的生活习性，同时就现场捕捉老鼠，具体教给群众捕鼠办法。有一次，她在自治州首府——芒市，作了报告后，就马上带领了三百多名干部和群众到田里实地捕捉，只挖了一个多小时的鼠洞就捕捉了三百五十多只老鼠。在她的具体传授下，一年来全州出现了成百上千的捕鼠积极分子。在曹依秀的带动和影响下，全州全年共捕了老鼠二百八十多万只。
    曹依秀是一个傣族农民，没有读过书，是个六十七岁的老妈妈。她对于老鼠的生活习性有着丰富知识，她只要在田间用眼一看，就能判断出哪里有鼠洞，洞内有无老鼠，甚至洞内有多少老鼠，她都能根据老鼠的生活习性和环境判断出来。老大妈捕捉老鼠是为了扑灭鼠疫。她的家乡在1945年日本帝国主义占领期间，日寇曾大量散布鼠疫，许多村寨大批死人，1951年党和政府派来了防治人员，才扑灭了鼠疫。这时她才知道鼠疫就是老鼠身上带来的，要消灭鼠疫，必须先消灭老鼠。从此，曹依秀九年如一日地在早晨外出干农活时，一定要带着锄头，沿路留心看有无鼠洞，发现了立即就挖。后来她又想到，要彻底消灭老鼠，必须摸清它的生活习惯。以后在每次挖洞前，她就留心观察洞口周围的情况和自然环境、洞内的情形等等，逐渐掌握了老鼠的生活习性。从1951年到现在，她一共消灭了老鼠一万多只。1958年她到昆明市为昆明医学界作了关于老鼠生活习性的现场学术讲演，得到了相当高的科学评价。曹依秀已被选为中国科学协会会员，中国医学科学院也聘她为特约研究员，有关卫生部门还聘请她为技术顾问。她在去年又光荣地出席了全国社会主义建设妇女积极分子代表大会。
