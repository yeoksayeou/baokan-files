Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Leaders of some Japanese mass organizations have condemned West German Chancellor Adenauer's sinister activities in Japan.

Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that Adenauer's visit to Japan is a matter that deserves vigilance from the Japanese peace forces. He also said that the Kishi Nobusuke government signed a new "Security Treaty" with the United States, and the West German government is stepping up its nuclear armament. This is an obvious conspiracy by the United States, Japan, and West Germany to undermine the upcoming East-West summit conference. He called on the Japanese people to launch a resolute struggle against this.

Tanehashi Shigeru, the International Director of "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), condemned Adenauer for coming to Japan to encourage the Kishi Nobusuke group to strengthen the Japan-U.S. "security system" and for requesting the Kishi Nobusuke group to support their conspiracy to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Tanehashi said that the Japanese working class regards Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke as their common enemies. They will strengthen their unity with the German working class and fight together to the end.

Shinma Shoichi, Chairman of the Japan Youth League Council, pointed out the seriousness of Japan's rapid militarization and West Germany's beginning of nuclear armament. He said that the Japan Youth League Council firmly opposes the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" aimed at strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance and is joining hands with West German youth to oppose nuclear armament by Japan and West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Democratic Youth League issued a statement today, accusing Kishi Nobusuke and Adenauer of being single-mindedly intent on establishing a reactionary international group under the command of the United States.

The statement said that Adenauer's visit to Japan is to strengthen the collusion between West Germany and the Kishi Nobusuke group in order to support the Western camp. Adenauer is attempting to use this to undermine the upcoming summit meeting.

The statement pointed out that Adenauer will encourage Kishi Nobusuke to strengthen domestic rule based on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement concluded by saying that Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke are enemies of world peace. Therefore, they are also the common enemies of German and Japanese youth. The Japan Democratic Youth League will take on the task of exposing the true faces of Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke to Japanese youth.

Kawasaki Natsu, Chairman of the Japan Mothers' Congress Working Committee, told reporters that the purpose of Hitler's successor, Adenauer's, visit to Japan is clearly to accelerate the collusion between the Asian and European anti-communist bases. She said that Japanese mothers oppose the establishment of a U.S.-West Germany-Japan tripartite alliance that will lead to war.

Former Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, when talking about Adenauer's "theory" at a press conference on the 26th that disarmament can only be achieved through expanding armaments, pointed out that this is ridiculous and does not suit the current international situation. He said that Adenauer's assertion that Japan and Germany (West Germany) face a common "communist threat" is also absurd.

Arita Hachiro emphasized that neither the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" nor the Japan-West Germany anti-communist alliance can guarantee Japan's security. "Only neutrality can guarantee Japan's security."

    阿登纳岸信介是世界和平的敌人
    日本公众舆论反对日本西德勾结的阴谋
    新华社28日讯　日本一些群众团体负责人纷纷谴责西德总理阿登纳到日本进行罪恶活动。
    日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会理事长安井郁说，阿登纳访日对于日本和平力量来说是值得提高警惕的一件事情。他又说，岸信介政府同美国签订了新“安全条约”，西德政府加紧进行核武装。这是美、日、西德三国企图破坏即将召开的东西方首脑会议的明显的阴谋。他号召日本人民对此展开坚决斗争。
    “总评”国际部长种桥茂谴责阿登纳到日本鼓舞岸信介集团加强日美“安全体系”，并请求岸信介集团支持他们阻挠和平统一德国的阴谋。
    种桥说，日本工人阶级把阿登纳和岸信介同样看做是自己的敌人。他们将加强同德国工人阶级的团结，共同斗争到底。
    日本青年团协议会会长真量昭一，指出日本迅速军国主义化和西德开始核武装的严重性，他说，日本青年团协议会坚决反对旨在加强日美军事同盟的新日美“安全条约”，并正同西德青年携起手来反对日本和西德进行核武装。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本民主青年团今天发表声明，指责岸信介和阿登纳正在美国的指挥下一心要建立反动的国际集团。
    声明说，阿登纳访问日本是为了加强西德同岸信介集团的勾结，以便支持西方阵营。阿登纳企图借此破坏即将举行的最高级会议。
    声明指出，阿登纳将鼓励岸信介根据新日美“安全条约”来加强国内统治。
    声明最后说，阿登纳同岸信介是世界和平的敌人。因此也是德国和日本青年的共同敌人。日本民主青年团将担负起向日本青年揭露阿登纳和岸信介的真面目的任务。
    日本母亲大会工作委员会主席河崎夏对新闻记者说，希特勒的继承人阿登纳访问日本的目的显然是为了加紧亚洲和欧洲反共基地之间的勾结。她说，日本母亲们反对建立将会导致战争的美国—西德—日本三国联盟。
    日本前外务相有田八郎在谈到阿登纳26日在记者招待会上发表的只有通过扩充军备才能达成裁军的“理论”时指出，这是可笑的，它不适合于当前的国际局势。他说，阿登纳所谓的日本和德国（西德）面临共同的“共产主义威胁”的说法也是荒谬的。
    有田八郎强调说，日美“安全条约”和日本、西德反共联盟，都不能保障日本的安全。“只有中立才能保障日本的安全”。
