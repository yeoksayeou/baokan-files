    Regarding "Party Secretary's Notebook"

    We have successively received many letters from readers welcoming the "Party Secretary's Notebook" column in the supplement. For example, Comrade Su Minyu, a hardware worker from Shamantun, Harbin, said that the two articles "Three Stars Shine on the New Rivers and Mountains" and "Guarantee of a Flying Start" are both brimming with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward of the 1960s. Comrades Du Teng and Wang Ting from Beijing University of Political Science and Law said, "These articles are full of life. We are encouraged and educated by these articles." Comrade Ke Anting from Miaoling Commune, Echeng, Hubei, wrote: "The Party secretaries are very busy with their work, but they still squeeze out time to write the articles we need, which deeply educate us. These articles are deeply moving both ideologically and artistically." Readers thanked the Party secretaries and also asked the newspaper to frequently publish the Party secretaries' notebooks.

    The purpose of opening this column is to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and Party organizations at all levels and practical work. Through this column, we can vividly reflect the rapidly changing new face of socialist construction in various regions and industries, as well as the rich and colorful changes in the lives of the masses. Therefore, we warmly hope that the secretaries of Party organizations in various regions, industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, schools, and various fronts will support this column and write more lively, colorful, short, and concise articles. The form of the articles can be varied, including political commentaries, essays, notes, diaries, letters, etc., so that the newspaper can better reflect reality and the new face of the thoughts and lives of the broad masses in various regions.

    Suggestions for the Agriculture Edition

    Preventing pests and diseases is an important task to ensure a bumper harvest. The commentary on eliminating wheat rust published on page 3 of the People's Daily on February 3, along with the introduction of several effective rust prevention agents, was very timely. I hope that more information on the prevention and control of diseases of crops, livestock, and poultry will be introduced in the future.

    The People's Daily page 3 often publishes reports on agricultural technology innovation and the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" from various regions, and has also published some investigation reports and valuable technical data. These articles can guide production in a timely manner. I hope that more news and articles on agricultural technology transformation and experimental research will continue to be published in the future.

    This Oversight Should Be Avoided

    The short article "Looking at it Differently" on page 3 on February 11 mentioned "Xinxu Commune, Jingxi County, Guangxi Province." This wording is inappropriate. It should be "Xinxu Commune, Jingxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region." I hope the editors will avoid this oversight in the future.

    These words were spoken by Marx and Engels

    In the article "Studying Marxism-Leninism and Transforming the Worldview" written by Comrade Xu Feiguang on page 7 on February 17, it is said: "As Lenin said, they are fundamentally unwilling to carry out changes in the entire society for the benefit of the revolutionary proletariat; they only want to make a change in the social system that can make the existing society as pleasant and comfortable as possible for them." As far as I know, these words were originally spoken by Marx and Engels in "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League," not by Lenin. I hope that quotations will be checked in the future to avoid errors.

    (The criticisms of Comrades Liang Yibang and Tu Quanru are correct. --Editor)

    读者、作者、编者
    关于“党委书记手记”
    我们陆续收到许多读者来信，欢迎副刊上的“党委书记手记”这一栏。如哈尔滨沙漫屯五金工人苏民玉同志说“三星高照新河山”和“开门红的保证”两篇，都洋溢着六十年代的跃进气息。北京政法学院杜藤、王汀同志说“这些文章有血有肉。我们从这些文章中得到鼓舞，也受到教育。”湖北鄂城庙岭公社柯安亭同志来信说：“党委书记们的工作，是十分忙碌的，但他们仍挤出时间写出我们所需要的文章，深刻地教育了我们。这些文章，在思想上和艺术上都深切动人。”读者们一方面感谢党委书记们，一方面也要求报纸经常发表党委书记们的手记。
    我们开辟这个专栏的目的，就是为了加强报纸与各级党的组织和实际工作的联系，通过这个专栏，生动活泼地反映各地区、各行各业社会主义建设日新月异的新面貌，以及丰富多采的群众生活的变化。因此，我们热烈地希望各地区、各个工矿企业、人民公社、学校和各个战线上党组织的书记同志们，支持这一栏，多写些生动活泼、丰富多采、短小精悍的文章，文章的形式可以多种多样，政论、散文、札记、日记、书信等等都可以。使报纸能更好地反映实际，反映各个地区广大群众的思想和生活的新面貌。

    对农业版的建议
    预防病虫害是保证实现大丰收的一项重要工作。2月3日人民日报三版刊登了消灭麦锈病的评论，并介绍了几种防锈有效药剂。我觉得很及时。希望今后多介绍一些有关农作物、家畜、家禽等病害的防治方法。
                                    河南元庆农业中学　夏农                   
    人民日报第三版上经常刊登各地农业技术革新、贯彻“八字宪法”的经验报道，并发表过一些调查报告和有价值的技术资料。这些文章能及时地指导生产。希望以后继续刊载有关农业技术改造、试验研究等方面的消息和文章。
                                 新疆绥定县　李大修
    应当避免这种疏忽
    2月11日三版“另眼相看”这篇短文中提到“广西省靖西县新墟公社”。这样写法是不妥当的，应该说“广西僮族自治区靖西县新墟公社”。希望编辑同志以后要避免这种疏忽。
                                      广西　梁宜邦　张学孜
    这话是马克思和恩格斯说的
    2月17日七版上徐非光同志写的“学习马克思列宁主义和改造世界观”一文中说：“正如列宁所说的，他们根本不愿为革命无产者的利益实行变革整个社会，他们只想使社会制度发生一种能把现存社会弄成对他们尽可能惬意和舒服些的改变。”据我所知，这句话原为马克思和恩格斯在“中央委员会告共产主义者同盟书”一文中说的，不是列宁说的。希望以后引文要查对，以免发生错误。
                                    长春　涂荃儒
    （梁宜邦、涂荃儒等同志的批评是对的。——编者）
