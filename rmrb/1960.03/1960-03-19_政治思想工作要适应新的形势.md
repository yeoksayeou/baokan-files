Political and Ideological Work Must Adapt to the New Situation

	Shao Zhengping, Deputy Secretary of the General Branch Committee of Sanluli Management District, Shangguo Commune, Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province

	Over the past year, in our political and ideological work, we have followed the mass line extensively, launched mass movements on a large scale, carried out ideological education in a solid and down-to-earth manner, and conducted political mobilization with great fanfare, ensuring the continuous leap forward of all our tasks.

	Following the mass line in political and ideological work is not new. It is the lifeline of the Party's work, and all previous tasks have not deviated from it.

	The creation of the "Three-Three-One-Two" political and ideological work network is an embodiment of the mass line. However, the problem last year was that with the establishment of people's communes, both the political and ideological situation and the situation of production development had changed. Faced with the new situation and new tasks, how should the Party's political work further follow the mass line? This was a problem that had to be solved.

	To clarify this point, in the early days of the establishment of the people's commune, we conducted a general survey of the ideological state of all commune members. The results of the survey proved that the vast majority of commune members wholeheartedly supported this new type of social organization, the people's commune. However, they lacked sufficient understanding of the arduous task of transforming nature undertaken by the people's commune, the larger-scale cooperation required for larger-scale production, and the role of the people's commune in building a new socialist countryside. In particular, traditional ideas and habits had become obstacles to the great development of rural production and the great revolution in culture and technology. Therefore, the arduous task facing the Party organization was not only to transform the thousands of hearts and minds of the vast number of commune members into one, wholeheartedly for the commune, through massive political and ideological work, but also to carry out frequent, systematic, and in-depth political and ideological work, creating a lively political situation that is both democratic and centralized, both free and disciplined, and both unified in thought and personally relaxed, thereby guiding the high morale of the vast number of commune members to consolidate the people's commune and develop the people's commune production at high speed.

	If we had maintained the status quo in this political and ideological work, relying solely on a few branch committee members and the only three hundred or so propaganda backbone personnel, it would have been impossible to complete. We must rapidly expand the ranks of political and ideological work, forming an atmosphere where everyone does ideological work and everyone receives education. Therefore, the most important issue is that the Party organization must possess a strong red propaganda team and vigorously improve and cultivate this group of propaganda backbone personnel. Based on the characteristics of each Party and League member, we should absorb them as much as possible to participate in the "Three-Three-One-Two" work, making them the core force of the Party's political and ideological work. We also organized all the propaganda backbone personnel to participate in Party school and League school studies. On the one hand, we insisted on regular evaluations at the "Three Loves Day" meetings and the political cadres' bi-weekly reporting meetings. In addition, we also adopted the method of having experienced veteran cadres teach newly absorbed propaganda backbone personnel and specially established a spare-time art school, divided into music, fine arts, and literature and art, cultivating a group of specialized talents. Through these methods, in the past year, we have successively cultivated 650 activists in political and ideological work.

	Cultivating a large number of backbone personnel ensured that the "Three-Three-One-Two" could go to the fields, up the mountains, to the construction sites, into the canteens, and to various labor sites. "Where there are people, there is political and ideological work" became a reality. In the fields, during breaks, Party members gave Party lectures, League members gave League lectures, and commune members also attended Red and Expert schools. The youngsters of the club also played the erhu, beat bamboo clappers, and performed local operas or fast-talking rhymes with content such as opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging enthusiasm. With the growth and strengthening of this red political and ideological work team, some production team political captains organized the propagandists in their team into a propaganda group, with themselves as the leader, and divided the work according to each person's expertise into six categories: reading newspapers, books, broadcasting, writing, teaching singing, and blackboard newspapers, cooperating with the "Three-Three-One-Two" to carry out various political education and propaganda and mobilization. After discovering this organization, the Party general branch committee, after research, believed that it was a new development of the "Three-Three-One-Two" political and ideological work network, so it summarized it as "One Group Six Members" and, from February of last year, widely promoted it in the seventeen production teams of the entire management district. The "One Group Six Members" of the production team, in addition to cooperating with the "Three-Three-One-Two" in collective occasions to carry out political and ideological work, also frequently went deep into the homes of commune members to read newspapers, talk about new people and new things, or chat about daily life, solicit commune members' opinions, and listen to reflections and demands. They were very popular with commune members.

	Now that there is a red propaganda team on the political and ideological front, how can we guide them properly and coordinate their operations in an orderly manner? The Party general branch committee believes that we must maintain a clear head. In the complex ideological situation and the tense production movement, we must clarify the direction and concentrate the enthusiasm of the masses on the main work and production according to the different tasks of each period. The Party general branch committee must take effective measures to find directional things from the production and life reality of the vast number of commune members, and promptly support them to become banners recognized by the broad masses, thereby comprehensively promoting the work. To achieve this, we implemented the "Three Listens" (1. listen to the instructions and calls of the higher Party committee, 2. listen to the reports of the One Group Six Members, 3. listen to the reflections of the masses) and "Six Sees" (1. see Party newspapers to see the overall situation and recognize the direction, 2. see changes in labor attendance rate and labor morale, 3. see the daily life trends of commune members' families, 4. see changes in market sales, 5. see the rise and fall of savings deposits, 6. see the changes in the quality and quantity of commune members' labor production) and "Bi-Weekly Consultation" (the Party general branch collectively studies the ideological trends of the masses every ten days to prescribe the right medicine).

	In this way, over the past year, we have gathered a large amount of rich "weather data" from the masses, providing the command post with "consultations" at any time, enabling the command post to maintain a clear head, and thus frequently used the method of grasping typical examples in depth and comprehensively encouraging enthusiasm, making all non-proletarian ideas lose their market in Sanluli.

	Over the past year, we have conducted sixty-eight educational sessions for the masses through typical examples, and each time we have achieved the expected results. We have also sown a batch of "red seeds" among the masses - mass propaganda backbone members, creating a new situation in the entire management district where everyone engages in propaganda and politics is talked about everywhere. Because of extensively following the mass line in political and ideological work and closely combining it with the central work and production tasks, political and ideological work has truly played the role of "sounding the gong to clear the way and beating the drum to ascend the hall."

    政治思想工作要适应新的形势
    中共运城县上郭公社三路里管理区总支委员会副书记　　邵正平
    过去一年中，我们在政治思想工作中，大走群众路线，大搞群众运动，扎扎实实地进行思想教育，轰轰烈烈地进行政治鼓动，保证了各项工作的不断跃进。
    政治思想工作走群众路线，并不是新事情了。它是党的工作生命线，以往各项工作都没有离开过它。
    “三三一二”政治思想工作网的创造，就是群众路线的一种体现。但是，去年的问题在于：人民公社成立了，政治思想形势和生产发展形势，都发生了变化，在新形势新任务面前，党的政治工作应该怎样更进一步走群众路线，这是必须解决的问题。
    为了弄清这一点，我们在人民公社成立初期，就对全体社员的思想状况进行了一次普遍调查。调查的结果证明，绝大多数社员对人民公社这一种新型的社会组织是热诚拥护的。但是，他们对人民公社所肩负的改造大自然的繁重任务，对更大规模生产必须更大规模的协作，对人民公社在建设社会主义新农村，认识不足，特别是传统的思想习惯和生活方式，已经成为农村生产大发展和文化技术大革命的阻力。因此，摆在党组织面前的艰巨任务是不仅要通过巨大的政治思想工作，把广大社员的千条心、万条心扭成一条心，一心为公社。而且要进行经常的系统的深入的政治思想工作，创造一个既有民主，又有集中；既有自由，又有纪律；既有统一思想，又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面，从而把广大社员的高涨情绪引导到巩固人民公社和高速度发展人民公社生产上来。
    这种政治思想工作，如果我们仍然维持原状，仅仅依靠几个支部委员和仅有的三百多个宣传骨干是无法完成的。必须迅速地壮大政治思想工作的队伍，形成人人做思想工作，人人受教育的空气。因此，最重要的问题是党组织必须拥有一支实力雄厚的红色宣传队伍，并大力提高培养这批宣传骨干。根据每个党、团员的特点，尽量吸收他们参加“三三一二”的工作，使他们成为党的政治思想工作的核心力量。并组织所有的宣传骨干，参加了党校、团校学习，一方面，在“三爱日”会和政治干部每十天的汇报会上，坚持经常的评比工作。此外，还采取了由有经验的老干部包教新吸收的宣传骨干，并且专门成立了一所业余艺术学校，分为音乐、美术、文艺三部分，培养了一批专门人材。通过这些办法，在去年一年中，先后培养了六百五十名政治思想工作的积极分子。
    大批培养骨干，使“三三一二”下田、上山、到工地、进食堂和各种劳动场所得到了保证。“那里有人，那里就有政治思想工作”成为现实。在田间，一到休息时间，党员就上党课，团员就上团课，社员也上了红专学校，俱乐部的小伙子们也拉胡琴、打竹板，表演起反右倾、鼓干劲一类内容的地头戏或者快板来。随着这一支红色政治思想工作队伍的成长和壮大，有的生产队的政治队长，就把自己队里的宣传员组成一个宣传组，自己任组长，并根据各个人的特长按读报、图书、广播、编写、教唱、板报等六项分了工，配合“三三一二”，进行各种不同的政治教育和宣传鼓动。党总支委员发现这一组织后，经过研究，认为它是“三三一二”政治思想工作网的新发展，就把它总结叫做“一组六员”，于是从去年2月份，就在全管理区的十七个生产队中普遍推广开了。生产队的“一组六员”，他们除了在集体场合配合“三三一二”进行政治思想工作外，还经常深入社员家里，读报纸、讲新人新事或者谈谈家常，征求社员意见，听听反映要求。很受社员欢迎。
    在政治思想战线上有了一支红色宣传队伍，要怎样才能指导得当，有条不紊地协同作战呢？党总支委员会认为，必须保持清醒的头脑。在复杂的思想形势和紧张的生产运动中，明确方向，把群众的干劲，根据各个时期不同的任务，集中到主要工作和生产上去。党的总支委员会必须采取有效措施，从广大社员的生产和生活实际中寻找方向性的事物，及时扶植它成为广大群众所承认的旗帜，从而全面地推动工作。为了做到这一点，我们就在制度上和方法上实行了“三听”（一听上级党委的指示号召，二听一组六员汇报，三听群众反映）、“六看”（一看党报看大局、识方向，二看劳动出勤率和劳动情绪的变化，三看社员家庭日常生活的动向，四看市场的销售的变化，五看储蓄存款的升降，六看社员劳动生产质量和数量的变化）、“十天会诊”（党总支每十天集体研究一次群众思想动向，以便对症下药）。
    这样，一年来我们从群众中集中了大量内容丰富的“气象资料”，随时提供指挥部“会诊”，使指挥部保持了清醒的头脑，从而经常运用深入抓典型，全面鼓干劲的方法，使一切非无产阶级思想在三路里失去流行的市场。
    一年来，我们通过典型事例，对群众进行了六十八次教育，每次都收到了预期的效果。并且在群众中撒下了一批“红色种子”——群众性的宣传骨干分子，在全管理区出现了人人搞宣传，处处讲政治的新局面。由于在政治思想工作上大走群众路线，紧密结合中心工作和生产任务，使政治思想工作真正起了“鸣锣开道，击鼓升堂”的作用。
