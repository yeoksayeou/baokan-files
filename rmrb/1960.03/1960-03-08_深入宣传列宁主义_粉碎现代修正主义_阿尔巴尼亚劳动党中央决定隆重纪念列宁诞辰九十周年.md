Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 6th. The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party today issued a resolution deciding to solemnly commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth and to deeply propagate Leninism.

The resolution stated: Lenin was the brilliant successor to the cause of Marx and Engels, the teacher and great leader of the international proletariat, and the founder of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the first socialist country. In its activities, the Albanian Labor Party has always followed the immortal Leninist doctrine. It is precisely because it has always been loyal to and resolutely implemented Leninism in the struggle against opportunism and revisionism that it has won the heroic victory of the national liberation war and achieved great successes in the cause of building socialism.

The resolution stated that the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party has decided to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign across the country to enable party members and the working masses to better familiarize themselves with Lenin's life and immortal Marxist-Leninist thought. The propaganda will emphasize Lenin's historical role and international significance in the liberation struggle to free the proletariat and the working masses from capitalist exploitation and oppression, promote the achievements of socialist countries and the international communist movement under the banner of Leninism, promote the strengthening of friendship with Lenin's motherland, the Soviet Union, and all the powerful socialist camp countries, emphasize Lenin's contributions to the further development of Marxism under new historical conditions, emphasize Lenin's contributions to defending Marxism and smashing opportunism and revisionism, and especially emphasize the great significance of the struggle to expose and smash modern revisionism, specifically manifested by Yugoslavia, under the current conditions. The resolution also stated that it is necessary to publicize Lenin's program for building socialism and communism during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, and the great significance of realizing this program in Albania. In particular, it is necessary to publicize Lenin's ideas on the reactionary essence of imperialism, on the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems, and on the ideological struggle between them, and to publicize Lenin's ideas on maintaining peace and friendship among all peoples to party members and the masses.

The resolution stipulates that, in addition to holding grand commemorative activities throughout Albania on April 22, reports, symposiums, and exhibitions will be held in factories, rural areas, schools, and mass organizations in various places. Publishing houses will publish Lenin's works and books about Lenin.

    新华社地拉那6日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会今天发表了一项决议，决定隆重纪念列宁诞辰九十周年，并且深入地宣传列宁主义。
    决议说：列宁是马克思、恩格斯事业的天才的继承人，是国际无产阶级的导师和伟大的领袖，是苏联共产党和第一个社会主义国家的奠基人。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在自己的活动中，过去和现在都遵循着不朽的列宁学说。正是由于它在反对机会主义和修正主义斗争中永远忠实于和坚决地执行了列宁主义，才获得了民族解放战争的英勇胜利，才在建设社会主义事业中获得了巨大成就。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央决定在全国展开一次大规模的宣传运动，使劳动党党员和劳动群众更好地熟悉列宁的生平和不朽的马克思列宁主义思想。在宣传中将强调说明列宁在争取无产阶级和劳动群众摆脱资本主义剥削和压迫的解放斗争中的历史作用和国际意义，宣传社会主义各国和国际共产主义运动在列宁主义旗帜下获得的成就，宣传加强同列宁主义的祖国苏联，同所有强大的社会主义阵营各国的友谊，强调列宁在新的历史条件下进一步发展马克思主义的功绩，强调列宁维护马克思主义和粉碎机会主义与修正主义的功绩，特别强调在当前的条件下揭露和粉碎以南斯拉夫为具体表现的现代修正主义的这一斗争的巨大意义。决议还说，应当宣传列宁关于从资本主义走向社会主义过渡时期的建设社会主义和共产主义的纲领，以及在阿尔巴尼亚实现这一纲领的巨大意义。特别应该向党员和人民群众宣传列宁关于帝国主义的反动实质、关于不同制度的国家和平共处以及同它们之间思想斗争的思想，宣传列宁关于维护和平和各族人民友谊的思想。
    决议规定，除4月22日在阿尔巴尼亚全国隆重举行纪念活动以外，各地的工厂、农村、学校和群众团体都将举行报告会、座谈会和举办展览会等。出版机构将出版列宁的著作和关于列宁的书籍等。
