A Unique Drama
“Phoenix Facing the Sun”
Yan Zheng

Of the dozen or so plays presented by several national drama theaters and troupes in Beijing this time for observation and performance, all reflect the life of modern revolutionary struggle, sing praises of the Party's General Line, the brilliant victories of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, and extol the heroic figures and heroic images of the era who dared to compete with the heavens. At the same time, in artistic creation, they can be described as a riot of color and fragrance; the fresh breath of life conveyed by the unity of content and form deeply infects the audience.

The Sichuan People's Art Theater's performance of "Phoenix Facing the Sun" is a red rose blooming in a mountain stream in this garden of a hundred flowers.

This play depicts the story of a group of working women in a mountainous area, under the leadership of the Party, opening mountains to build dams and vigorously developing water conservancy to construct the mountainous area. In 1958, during the national Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of the people were high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, and bursting with energy. "Phoenix Facing the Sun" depicts the miracle made by working women on the socialist construction front under this overwhelming momentum; it demonstrates their revolutionary spirit and noble qualities.

After watching "Phoenix Facing the Sun," what particularly interested me was that this performance is the most sincere and vivid reflection of the revolutionary enthusiasm and heroic spirit of the working people in mountainous areas, so it has its own unique style and can be called one of the unique dramas in the observation and performance. Based on the characteristics of the labor and struggle life of the people in mountainous areas, at the opening of the play, in the celebration meeting place, Zhang Chaofeng, the young Communist Party member and leader of the women's team who led the effort to build the dam, said, "I can't speak well, so let's sing a mountain song according to our mountain area custom!" Afterwards, mountain songs run through the development of the entire play, expressing the lofty aspirations of the working women in the mountainous area to fight against the mountains. Here, she sings:

	Cloud Ridge Mountain, twelve cliffs,
	High mountains and steep walls, row by row,
	Mountains connect to the blue sky, obscuring the bright moon,
	Blocking the river water from passing through.
	Thinking of the pre-liberation days,
	The suffering of women was truly unbearable,
	All year round, for water,
	Carrying water buckets to climb high mountains.
	Cloud Ridge Mountain, not productive,
	Pressing down on the Stone Fortress's inability to lift its head,
	Without water, rice and wheat cannot be planted,
	Fair maidens are unwilling to marry into the high mountains.

This is a portrayal of the impoverished and miserable life of the people in the mountainous areas of the old society. But all of China has been liberated, and the people have become the masters of the country. Especially under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for building socialism, the people in the mountainous areas sing:

	Mountains are never higher than the red sun,
	Stones are never harder than strong resolve.
	Waving hands to mend the sky and fill the sea,
	Sweep away a thousand obstacles and ten thousand difficulties.
	Back then, Zhang Fei roared on the bridge,
	Roaring and breaking the bridge, reversing the water flow,
	Women are even fiercer than Zhang Fei,
	Wanting to make the river water climb the mountain.

What a truly earth-shattering spirit! Why are their wills so strong? The author arranges a scene at the climax of the play where Zhang Chaofeng single-handedly hangs on a precipice to drill stone holes and blast the mountain. This is a very thrilling dramatic plot, but on the stage, the scene is expressed with a reprise of mountain songs, presenting a beautiful and poetic atmosphere. It does not make the audience worry, but rather, with the melody of labor and lyricism, overflowing with the optimistic emotions and lofty ideals of the hero, impacts the audience's heartstrings.

Under the leadership, support, and care of the Party, the women's team finally overcame numerous difficulties, defeated conservative thinking, and broke through the feudal ideological remnants that bound and belittled women, enabling the early completion of the dam water conservancy project and changing the face of the mountainous area. People couldn't help but sing:

	The red sun rises in the east,
	The sun is the Communist Party.
	Forever following the Communist Party,
	Dragons leaping and tigers bounding, phoenix facing the sun.

"Phoenix Facing the Sun" is a hymn: praising women for abandoning all old traditions, old habits, old perspectives, and old ideas that hinder their progress, and praising the joy of the working people. "Phoenix Facing the Sun" is an ode: praising the wise Party, praising the new life, praising the heroism of the people in labor and struggle, and praising the bright future ideals.

The performance of this play not only uses mountain songs to vividly express the theme of the Great Leap Forward and the General Line, but also adopts and absorbs the performance forms of folk bands and folk dances, further enriching the local flavor of the whole play, making the audience feel very close. "Phoenix Facing the Sun" can give people such a fresh feeling, mainly because it is a product of the struggle life of the Great Leap Forward era, and it is also the result of the author and all the comrades of the Sichuan People's Art Theater breathing together with the heroic era. In particular, the Sichuan People's Art Theater's performance is entirely by young actors; whether in singing mountain songs or expressing the high-spirited and rough character and emotions of the people in mountainous areas, they are relatively moving.

Of course, "Phoenix Facing the Sun," like other new things, still has incomplete and immature aspects. For example, the most prominent is that the playwright cannot consistently grasp the main line of the dramatic event opposing conservative ideas and developing, and in the second half, uses too much space to describe misunderstandings in love, placing the struggle against feudal ideological remnants in parallel with this line, and even in some places higher than the main line, making the conflict in the whole play lose its primary and secondary focus, and also making some dramatic plots fall into a set pattern. This kind of playwriting conception also directly affects the shaping of the characters. For example, the hero Zhang Chaofeng's husband (Wang Qingyun) is portrayed inappropriately, writing him as a figure who is both a production expert, an activist, a member of the Communist Youth League, and also coexists with relatively strong feudal ideas. In addition to the character of Wang Qingyun not being realistic enough, it also damages the heroic character of Zhang Chaofeng.

    独出一格的话剧
    “丹凤朝阳”
    严正
    这次全国几个话剧院、团来京观摩演出的十几个剧目，都是反映现代革命斗争生活，歌颂党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的辉煌胜利，歌颂同时代要与天公比高低的英雄人物和英雄群像。同时，在艺术创造上，可称为百花争艳，芬芳诱人；由于内容和形式的统一所传达出来的新鲜的生活气息深深地感染着观众。
    四川人民艺术剧院演出的“丹凤朝阳”，就是百花园里一支山涧里盛开的红玫瑰。
    这个戏是描写山区一群劳动妇女，在党的领导下，开山修堰，大搞水利，建设山区的故事。1958年全国大跃进，广大人民群众意气奋发、斗志昂扬、干劲冲天。“丹凤朝阳”就是描写在这种排山倒海的气势下，劳动妇女在社会主义建设战线上做出的奇迹；表现了她们的革命精神和崇高品质。
    看完“丹凤朝阳”以后，使我特别感到兴趣的是：这个演出是山区劳动人民革命热情和英雄豪迈气概最真切、最生动的反映，所以它具有自己独特的风格，在观摩演出中可称是独出一格的话剧之一。剧作者根据山区人民劳动和斗争生活的特点，在剧一开头的庆功会场上，年青的共产党员、领导妇女打堰开山的排长张朝凤就说：“我不会讲话，还是按照我们山区的习惯唱个山歌吧！”以后就以山歌贯串着全剧的发展，表达出山区劳动妇女向山岳开战的壮志雄心。在这里，她这样唱道：
    云岭山，十二岩，
    山高壁陡排对排，
    山接青天遮明月，
    下挡河水过不来。
    想起那，解放前，
    妇女受苦实难当，
    一年四季为了水，
    背起水桶爬高山。
    云岭山，不成才，
    压得石堡头难抬，
    无水种不成稻和麦，
    情妹不愿嫁到高山来。
  这是旧社会山区人民的穷困悲惨生活的写照。但是全中国解放了，人民做了国家的主人，特别是在党的建设社会主义总路线光辉照耀下，山区的人们就唱起：
    山高高不过红太阳，
    石硬硬不过决心强。
    挥动补天填海手呀，
    千阻万难一扫光哟。
    当年张飞桥上吼，
    吼断桥梁水倒流，
    妇女更比张飞猛，
    要叫河水上山头。
    真是气吞山河的气概！她们究竟为什么意志这样坚强呀？作者在全剧高潮上安排了张朝凤只身系挂悬岩打石眼崩山的一场戏。这是一段非常惊险的戏剧情节，但是，舞台上却以山歌重唱表现出优美而富有诗意的场面。它不使观众去提心吊胆，而是以劳动抒情的旋律，洋溢着英雄人物的乐观情绪和主人翁远大的理想冲击着观众的心弦。
    在党的领导、支持和关怀下，妇女排终于克服了重重困难，战胜了保守思想，冲破了束缚妇女、轻视妇女的封建思想残余，使打堰水利工程提前完成，使山区改变了面貌。人们情不自禁地歌唱起来：
    东方升起红太阳，
    太阳就是共产党。
    永远跟着共产党，
    龙腾虎跃凤朝阳。
    “丹凤朝阳”是一首赞歌：赞美妇女唾弃一切阻碍她们前进的旧传统、旧习惯、旧眼光和旧思想，赞美劳动人民的欢乐。“丹凤朝阳”是一首颂歌：歌颂英明的党，歌颂新生活，歌颂人民劳动和斗争中的英雄主义，歌颂未来美好的理想。
    这个戏的演出，不仅运用了山歌生动地表现了大跃进和总路线的主题，同时采用和吸取了民间乐队与民间舞蹈的表现形式，更加丰满了全剧的乡土气息，使观众感到很亲切。“丹凤朝阳”能给人以这样的新鲜感觉，主要是由于它是大跃进时代斗争生活的产物，也是作者和四川人民艺术剧院全体同志和英雄时代共呼吸的成果。特别是四川人艺的演出全部都是青年演员；无论在山歌演唱和表现山区人民高昂粗犷的性格和情绪上都是比较动人的。
    当然“丹凤朝阳”也跟其它新事物一样，还有不够完整，不够成熟的地方。比方，最突出的是：剧作者不能始终如一地紧紧抓住戏剧事件反对保守思想发展的主线，而在后半部用过多的笔墨描写爱情上的误会，把反封建思想残余的斗争与这条线并列，甚至有的地方高于主线，使全剧冲突主次不分，也使得部分戏剧情节落了套子。这种剧作构思，也直接影响了人物的塑造。比如对英雄人物张朝凤的丈夫（王青云）做了不恰当的描写，把他写成既是生产能手、积极分子、共青团员，又是有比较浓厚封建思想并存的人物。除王青云人物不够真实外，也损伤了张朝凤这个英雄人物。
