Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st: "Pathet Lao News" points out that U.S. imperialism is increasingly and brazenly engaging in armed interference in Laos. American military advisors are in practical control of the Lao army’s command from the Lao Ministry of Defense down to the battalion level.

This newspaper published an article on February 23rd stating that in 1959, U.S. imperialism helped its running dogs newly establish about eighty companies of armies and bandit organizations. In Sam Neua, Phongsaly and many other places, they formulated military plans for the Kingdom's army and directly commanded various battalions and companies of the Kingdom's army to carry out "mopping-up" operations.

The article also said that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs forced the Lao people to build military strongholds and airports for them. They newly built thirty military airports in Laos, and most of the airports have been completed so far. Among them, Wattay, Ban Natan, Muang Khong, Plain of Jars and other airports can be used for heavy aircraft to land.

The article said that the United States also helped Laos build a modern shooting range in Pakse province, and transferred many Lao officers to the United States and its servant countries for military training.

The article said that in 1959 alone, the United States gave Laos "aid" amounting to $43,079,000, most of which was weapons, military supplies, and funds for American military advisors.

The article said that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism is to rapidly turn Laos into their war base in Southeast Asia. U.S. Secretary of the Army Bruck openly announced in early February this year that the U.S. military has formulated a plan to fight in Laos. On February 19th, U.S. Army Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Region White visited Laos. He inspected military strongholds, inspected various units and military academies of the Kingdom’s army, and urged the acceleration of the construction of American military bases. Currently, American interventionists are urging its running dogs – Lao warlord elements – to expand the civil war in Laos in order to maintain a state of war that is favorable to the United States.

The article concluded: "Our only path is to fight to drive out the American interventionists and overthrow their reactionary running dogs—the heads of the 'Committee for the Defense of National Interests.' Only in this way can Laos achieve peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unification, and prosperity."

    新华社河内1日电　“老挝爱国新闻”指出，美帝国主义正日益明目张胆地武装干涉老挝，美国军事顾问在实际上掌握着从老挝国防部直到王国军队营级单位的指挥权。
    这家报纸在2月23日发表文章说，1959年内，美帝国主义帮助它的走狗新建立军队和土匪组织约八十个连。在桑怒、丰沙里和其他许多地方，他们给王国军队制定军事计划，并且直接指挥王国军队各营和连进行“扫荡”。
    文章又说，美帝国主义及其走狗强迫老挝人民为他们建设军事据点和机场。他们在老挝新建了三十个军用机场，到目前为止，大部分机场已经建成。其中，瓦泰、弯南塔、芒空、查尔平原等机场，可以供重型飞机着陆。
    文章说，美国还帮助老挝在巴色省建设现代化的射击场，并且抽调许多老挝军官到美国及其仆从国家去进行军事训练。

    文章说，美帝国主义的阴谋是迅速把老挝变成它们在东南亚的战争基地。美国陆军部长布鲁克在今年2月初明目张胆地宣布，美国军
  方已制定了在老挝作战的计划。2月19日，美国太平洋地区陆军总司令怀特到老挝活动，他视察了军事据点，检查了王国军队各单位和军官学校，并且督促加速建设美国军事基地。目前美国干涉者正在催促它的走狗——老挝军阀分子扩大老挝内战，以便保持有利于美国的战争状态。
