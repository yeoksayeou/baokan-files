    (Reported by this newspaper) The Fifth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the First Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China was held from February 22nd to March 1st. At this meeting, the focus was on studying and discussing how to study Mao Zedong's works within the Party and how to strengthen leadership over agricultural production and rural work, and resolutions were passed.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Ningxia Autonomous Region has adhered to the general line of building socialism, continued to consolidate and improve the people's communes, and launched large-scale mass movements, enabling the autonomous region's agricultural production to achieve continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, and promoting the high-speed development of industry and other undertakings. This year is another year of continued leap forward. The industrial front has achieved a flying start. On the agricultural front, spring plowing preparations started early, and spring sowing in the irrigation area is currently underway, while spring sowing in the mountainous areas has also begun successively. The quality of spring sowing has been further improved, and other construction undertakings have also shown a situation of continued comprehensive leap forward. The meeting pointed out that agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy. In order to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in various construction undertakings, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership over agricultural production and rural work. According to the spirit of the central instructions and the current situation in the autonomous region, in the coming period, in addition to the autonomous region's Party committee and the municipal Party committees vigorously leading agricultural production and rural work, the prefectural and county Party committees should devote all their efforts to leading agricultural production and rural work.

    In order to ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill the 1960 grain production and other agricultural production tasks, the meeting believes that the following tasks must be done well:

    First, conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs" – both multiple planting for more yield and high yield for more yield – and closely combine multiple planting and high yield to achieve the goal of more yield. On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure the proper cultivation of existing farmland and complete the task of expanding cultivated land. On the other hand, it is necessary to continue to comprehensively and appropriately implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in light of local conditions, and strive to increase the yield per unit area. In terms of specific measures, mountainous areas should continue to vigorously develop water storage and transportation projects, actively achieve water conservancy, and strengthen drought prevention and water and soil conservation work. Plain areas should vigorously develop drainage projects, actively achieve small-scale stream and garden management, and improve saline-alkali soil. Currently, we must vigorously grasp the spring plowing production movement.

    Second, we must implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link, making overall arrangements for various economic crops, promoting planting and animal husbandry simultaneously, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries." All cadres must clearly understand the dialectical relationship between planting and animal husbandry. While developing planting, we must actively develop animal husbandry, and actively develop livestock and poultry. The Han areas should vigorously develop pig farming. Change the backward state of large livestock breeding and reproduction to promote the high-speed development of agricultural production.

    Third, immediately launch a vigorous and large-scale mass movement for technical innovation and technical revolution. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously strengthen leadership, adopt methods of unified planning, organized coordination, focusing on key points, and comprehensively launching mass movements to vigorously carry out tool reform and improve the utilization rate of machinery. Actively realize semi-mechanization to create conditions for gradually realizing mechanization. At the same time, we must develop rural cultural and educational undertakings, take various measures to train technical talents in various fields, and gradually establish scientific and technological institutions at all levels to form a mass upsurge of creation and promotion, learning and research of science and technology. Through reforming tools, improving technology and management, and improving labor efficiency.

    Fourth, industry must support agriculture more vigorously. This is the political task of all employees on the industrial front. All industrial departments and all factories and mines should, while ensuring the completion of the state production plan, formulate a plan to support agriculture, establish specialized organizations for industrial support to agriculture, and effectively organize its implementation.

    Fifth, the financial and trade departments are the logistics departments for production and construction, and must continue to strengthen the political, mass, and production viewpoints of all employees, so that they can proactively and promptly supply means of production, purchase agricultural and sideline products, and organize the people's economic life. The People's Bank of China should, according to agricultural needs, help communes do a good job in the reserve and use of production funds, and promptly issue agricultural loans and other funds used for agriculture. In order to give full play to the promoting role of financial and trade departments in agricultural production, the contract system of the three-way combination of commerce, banks (or financial departments), and communes should be widely promoted.

    The meeting believes that while focusing on production, it is necessary to effectively arrange the lives of the masses. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must care about their lives. The more we care about their lives, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be. At the same time, we must also effectively do a good job in the distribution of income. On the basis of increasing production and expanding accumulation, more than 90% of the commune members should increase their income. And within one month of the summer harvest and two months after the autumn harvest, it must be distributed to the commune members.

    The meeting believes that in order to further consolidate and improve the people's communes and give full play to their greater role in promoting production and various tasks, it is first necessary to firmly establish the absolute leading advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants and strengthen the leadership of the Party. Second, it is necessary to conduct systematic socialist and communist education for cadres and commune members, train cadres and various professional talents in batches and in rotation, rationally determine various staffing levels, and rectify and improve organizational structures at all levels. Seize the opportunity to train, train, and enrich the "eight key personnel" such as accountants, cashiers, keepers, cooks, feeders, nursery staff, health workers, and canteen managers. Special attention should be paid to selecting a group of outstanding poor and lower-middle peasant women to take on this work. Third, through the current socialist education movement, absorb a group of poor and lower-middle peasant activists who meet the requirements of Party and League membership into the Party and the League. In absorbing Party members and selecting cadres, special attention should be paid to cultivating and selecting outstanding members from the Hui and Hui-Han ethnic groups. And further improve the basic-level organizations of the Party and the League to strengthen the leading role of the Party. Fourth, require people's communes to establish farm tool repair and manufacturing plants, agricultural and sideline product processing plants, agricultural, forestry, and livestock farms, horticultural farms, and various livestock and poultry breeding farms in accordance with national plans and their own conditions; establish perennial basic construction, transportation, and other professional teams. In handling the economic relations between the commune and the team, and between teams, it is necessary to implement equivalent exchange. The farms, forest farms, and capital construction teams run by the commune must ensure self-sufficiency in grain. We must continue to strengthen the leadership of poor teams, help them vigorously carry out basic construction, actively run various enterprises, and quickly change their impoverished conditions. Since the vast majority of poor teams in the autonomous region are Hui or Hui-Han joint teams, helping poor teams quickly change their appearance can not only create conditions for further improving and developing the people's communes, but also is a fundamental measure to gradually eliminate the factual inequality between ethnic groups. Fifth, promote the spirit of communist cooperation, unify planting planning, and give play to the advantages of large-scale planting. At the same time, we should continue to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system, work assessment and scorekeeping, and small-scale contracting. On the basis of strengthening the collective responsibility system, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of small teams and commune members. When formulating the three guarantee plans and implementing rewards and punishments, they must be fully discussed by the masses. It is necessary to educate cadres and the masses with communist ideology, and at the same time, we must be clear about rewards and punishments. Production targets must be implemented, and measures to increase production must be practical and specific. In the process of implementing these systems, we must constantly summarize and improve them to constantly promote the development of productive forces. Sixth, conscientiously implement the principle of democratic management of the commune. The commune should hold at least two meetings of commune member representatives each year, the brigade should hold at least one meeting of commune member representatives each quarter, and the team should hold at least one meeting of commune members each month. The commune, brigade, and team management committees and management cadres should report their work to the meeting, publish accounts, discuss and approve major matters such as the production plan, the three guarantees and one reward plan, and the distribution plan of the commune and team, and inspect the work of the management committee and cadres.

    The meeting believes that with the increasing burden of agricultural production and rural work, Party committees at all levels must correspondingly improve their leadership level and improve the ideological style of leading members at all levels. To this end, the meeting requires: Socialist and communist education should be systematically conducted among Party members and cadres, and a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works should be launched. At present, we must focus on studying Chairman Mao's theories on socialist revolution and socialist construction, understanding and grasping the objective laws of socialist construction, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide practical struggle, establishing and strengthening the proletarian world outlook and the idea of continuous revolution of Party members and cadres, enhancing the ambition to build socialism and communism, promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and boosting greater revolutionary energy. We must highly promote the traditional style of hard work and close ties with the masses. We must often pay attention to improving the political and ideological level and leadership ability of basic-level leading cadres, improve leadership methods, and enhance the combat effectiveness of basic-level Party and League organizations. We must often adhere to Party class education for Party members, often carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen Party spirit training to ensure that leading cadres at all levels are always vigorous, energetic, and the most loyal and most able to connect with the masses, and give full play to the role of Party organizations at all levels as fighting bastions. In addition, we should also conscientiously implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on "combining the individual with the general," "combining leadership with the masses," and "from the masses, to the masses." Adhere to doing a good job in focusing on key points, cultivating experimental fields well, and through on-site visits, comparisons, and itinerant experience sharing, the activities of leading cadres are combined with large-scale mass movements, and various tasks can be more deeply integrated with reality. When new things are discovered, they should be protected, cultivated, studied, and vigorously promoted. The socialist competition movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, leading the intermediate, and helping the backward should be carried out continuously and deeply.

    中共宁夏区党委一届五次全体会议决定
    树立雄心大志　推动持续跃进
    本报讯　从2月22日到3月1日，中共宁夏回族自治区委员会召开了第一届第五次全体会议（扩大）。在这次会议上，着重研究和讨论了如何在党内学习毛泽东的著作和加强对农业生产和农村工作领导的问题，并通过了决议。
    在党中央的正确领导下，宁夏自治区坚持了建设社会主义总路线，坚持了不断巩固和健全人民公社，开展了大规模的群众运动，使自治区的农业生产，取得了1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，促进了工业和其他各项事业的高速度发展。今年又是一个继续跃进的形势，在工业战线上夺得了开门红；在农业战线上，春耕准备工作抓得早，灌区春播目前正在紧张进行，山区也已陆续开始，春播质量有了进一步提高，其他各项建设事业也出现了继续全面跃进的局面。会议指出农业是国民经济发展的基础，为了实现各项建设的全面跃进，各级党委必须加强对农业生产和农村工作的领导。根据中央指示精神和自治区当前情况，在今后一定时期内，除自治区党委和各市委要大力领导好农业生产和农村工作外，地、县委要全力领导好农业生产和农村工作。
    为了保证完成和争取超额完成1960年粮食生产和其他农业生产任务，会议认为必须抓好以下工作：
    第一、认真贯彻执行多种多收与高产多收两条腿走路的方针，把多种、高产紧密地结合起来，达到多收的目的。一方面要保证种好原有农田并完成扩大耕地的任务，另方面要继续全面地、因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，努力提高单位面积产量。在具体措施上，山区要继续大搞蓄输水工程，积极实现水利化，加强防旱抗旱和水土保持工作，川区要大搞排水工程，积极实现小溪园田化，改良盐渍化土壤，当前要大力抓好春耕生产运动。
    第二、必须贯彻执行以粮为纲，统筹安排各种经济作物，种植业和养殖业同时并举，农林牧副渔综合发展的方针。使所有干部明确认识种植业和养殖业互相促进的辩证关系，在发展种植业的同时，积极发展畜牧业，并积极发展家畜家禽，汉民地区要大力发展养猪；改变大家畜饲养繁殖的落后状态，以促进农业生产的高速度发展。
    第三、立即掀起一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的群众性技术革新和技术革命运动。各级党委要认真加强领导，采取统一规划、组织协作、抓住重点、全面开展群众运动的办法大搞工具改革，提高机具利用率。积极实现半机械化，为逐步实现机械化创造条件。同时，要发展农村文教事业，采取各种措施培养各方面的技术人材，逐步建立各级科学技术机构，形成群众性的创造和推广、学习和研究科学技术的高潮。通过改革工具，改进技术和管理，提高劳动效率。
    第四、工业要更加有力地支援农业。这是工业战线上全体职工的政治任务。各个工业部门和所有厂矿，应在保证完成国家生产计划的同时，订出支援农业的计划，设立工业支援农业的专门组织机构，切实组织实现。
    第五、财贸部门是生产建设的后勤部，必须继续加强全体职工的政治观点、群众观点和生产观点，使他们能够主动地、及时地供应生产资料，收购农副产品和组织人民的经济生活。人民银行应根据农业要求，帮助公社作好生产资金的储备使用，及时地把农业贷款和其它用于农业的资金发放下去。为了充分发挥财贸部门对农业生产的促进作用，应当广泛推行商业、银行（或财政部门）和公社三结合的合同制度。
    会议认为：在抓好生产的同时，必须切实安排好群众生活。群众干劲越大，越要关心群众生活。越关心群众生活，群众的干劲才会越大。与此同时，还必须切实作好收益分配工作。在增加生产、扩大积累的基础上，要使90％以上的社员增加收入。并在夏收一个月和秋收后的两个月内，一定要分配到社员手里。
    会议认为：为了进一步巩固与提高人民公社，充分发挥其对生产和各项工作的更大推动作用，首先必须巩固地树立贫农和下中农的绝对领导优势，加强党的领导。其次，要对干部和社员进行系统的社会主义、共产主义教育，分期分批轮训社队干部和各种专业人材，合理地确定各种编制，整顿和健全各级组织机构。抓紧培养、训练、充实会计、出纳、保管、炊事、饲养、保育、保健和食堂管理等“八大员”。要特别注意选拔一批优秀的贫农、下中农妇女担任这方面的工作。第三，通过当前社会主义教育运动，吸收一批具备党员团员条件的贫农、下中农积极分子入党入团。在吸收党员和选拔干部中，要特别注意培养选拔回族和妇女社员中的优秀分子。并进一步健全党、团的基层组织，以加强党的领导作用。第四，要求人民公社都能根据国家计划和自己的条件，办起农具修造、农副产、农、林、牧场、园艺场和各种家畜、家禽饲养场；建立常年基本建设、运输等专业队。在处理社与队、队与队之间的经济关系时，必须实行等价交换。社办的牧场、林场、基建队等事业单位，要保证粮食自足。要继续加强对穷队的领导，帮助他们大力进行基本建设，积极兴办各种企业，迅速改变穷困面貌。由于自治区穷队绝大多数都是回族或回汉族联合队，所以，帮助穷队迅速改变面貌，不仅能够为进一步提高和发展人民公社创造条件，而且是逐步消灭民族间事实上不平等的根本措施。第五，发扬共产主义的协作精神，统一规划种植，发挥大片种植的优越性。同时应继续实行“三包一奖”、评工记分、小段包工等经营管理制度。在加强集体责任制的基础上，充分调动小队和社员的积极性和创造性。在制订三包方案，实行奖罚的时候，必须经过群众充分讨论，既要以共产主义思想教育干部和群众，又必须作到赏罚严明。包产指标必须落实，增产措施必须切实具体。在实行这些制度的过程中，必须不断地总结提高，以经常促进生产力的发展。第六，认真贯彻执行民主办社原则，公社每年至少召开两次、大队每季至少召开一次社员代表大会，小队每月至少召开一次社员大会，由公社、大队和小队管理委员会和管理干部向大会报告工作，公布账目，讨论审定社队的生产计划、三包一奖方案、分配方案等重大事项，并检查管理委员会和干部的工作。
    会议认为：随着农业生产和农村工作的日益繁重，各级党委必须相应地提高自己的领导水平，改进各级领导成员的思想作风。为此，会议要求：在党员干部中要系统的进行社会主义、共产主义教育，学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作高潮。当前，要着重学习毛主席关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的学说，认识与掌握社会主义建设的客观规律，用毛泽东思想指导实践斗争，树立与坚定党员干部的无产阶级世界观和不断革命思想，增强建设社会主义、共产主义的雄心壮志，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，鼓足更大的革命干劲。要高度发扬艰苦朴实，密切联系群众的传统作风。要经常注意提高基层领导骨干的政治思想水平和领导能力，改进领导方法，增强基层党团组织的战斗力。要经常坚持对党员的党课教育，经常地开展批评与自我批评，加强党性锻炼，以保证各级领导骨干经常是朝气勃勃，干劲十足，最忠实、最能联系群众的优秀分子，充分发挥各级党组织的战斗堡垒作用。此外，并应认真贯彻执行党中央和毛主席关于“个别与一般相结合”，“领导与群众相结合”，“从群众中来，到群众中去”的指示。坚持搞好重点，种好试验田，并应通过现场参观评比，巡回传经取宝等形式，使领导骨干的活动和大规模群众运动结合起来，使各项工作都能更加深入实际。发现新生事物，要保护它，培养它，研究它，并大力加以推广。把学先进、赶先进、带动中间和帮助后进的社会主义竞赛运动持续深入地开展起来。
