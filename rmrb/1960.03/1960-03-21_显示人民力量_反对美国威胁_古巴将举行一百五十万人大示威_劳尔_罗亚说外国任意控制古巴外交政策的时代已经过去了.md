Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 16th: According to the resolution of the Executive Committee of the Cuban Workers' Confederation held today, a grand parade of 1.5 million people will be held in Havana this year on International Labor Day "May 1st." Participants will include workers, rebel soldiers, worker-militiamen, farmer-militiamen, student-militiamen, and ordinary residents. The marchers will carry slogans expressing resolute support for the revolutionary government and revolutionary laws, and for fighting against the invasion of imperialism, its lackeys, and domestic reactionaries.

At the meeting, the General Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation emphasized the importance of the "May 1st" parade for the working class and the revolutionary government at a time when Cuba's national sovereignty is threatened by international oligarchic interest groups and U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that this year's "May 1st" rally will be the most powerful gathering in Cuban history.

The meeting approved the appointment of the Central Committee responsible for organizing the parade.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation will send invitations to all central trade union organizations in Latin America to participate in Cuba's "May 1st" activities.

The meeting also decided to call on all workers in Havana to participate in the activities designated for the Week of Support for the Latin American People, starting on March 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to TASS, Mexico City, March 19th: The latest issue of "Siempre" magazine published an interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa by Mexican journalist Lagunas. Lagunas recently visited Cuba.

Roa said, "Before the overthrow of the cruel, corrupt, and traitorous Batista regime, Cuba's foreign policy was dictated by others in a foreign language over the telephone. The revolution is reforming our country's economic structure and social fabric, and the revolution has handed over true sovereignty in domestic and foreign policies to the Cuban government and people. Cuba's foreign policy has shaken off all the shackles that oppressed and enslaved Cuba. The revolutionary government does not need anyone's protection or direction. We hope to coexist peacefully with all countries on the basis of complete equality and mutual understanding."

Roa said that the revolutionary government has faithfully fulfilled, and will continue to faithfully fulfill, its obligations in Latin America and internationally, and demands that other countries do the same. It is not permissible to form alliances with one part of the world to oppose another part of the world. Bloc politics is the most terrible danger to universal peace.

Roa then spoke about the significance of the trade agreement signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union. He said that the excessive concentration of our foreign trade in terms of regions is a serious obstacle to economic development, and therefore, we must strive to overcome this obstacle in order to be able to act freely in foreign markets. Cuba has long sold sugar to the Soviet Union, and in this regard, we have guaranteed expanded markets and highly favorable loans from the Soviet Union.

When talking about the planned conference of underdeveloped countries to be held in Cuba, Roa expressed the hope that "all the governments of the American continent should support this conference like the governments of Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 19th: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa announced in a statement to the press today that the Cuban government has instructed its diplomatic representatives in the United States to demand that the U.S. government arrest José Eleuterio Pedraza, the Army Chief of Staff of the Batista dictatorship, and extradite him to the Cuban government. The statement said that Pedraza is accused of committing serious crimes that should be submitted to a court trial.

Pedraza, under U.S. protection, is currently in Florida, USA, plotting to organize a "Cuban government in exile" to confront the Cuban revolutionary government. The statement also announced that the Cuban chargé d'affaires in the United States has, according to the instructions of the Cuban government, made a request to the U.S. government for the extradition of Rolando Masferrer, the head of Batista's secret service organization "The Tigers."

Masferrer is still directing activities to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government in the United States.

Roa announced that the Cuban ambassadors to Mexico, Guatemala, and Chile have reported to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the governments of these three countries have, according to the requests of the Cuban revolutionary government for the extradition of Cuban war criminals, detained five Cuban war criminals.

    显示人民力量　反对美国威胁
    古巴将举行一百五十万人大示威
    劳尔·罗亚说外国任意控制古巴外交政策的时代已经过去了
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　根据古巴工人联合会今天举行的执行委员会的决议，今年“五一”国际劳动节将在哈瓦那举行一百五十万人的大游行，参加游行的将有工人、起义军、工人民兵、农民民兵和学生民兵以及普通居民。游行者将带着坚决支持革命政府、革命法律，和对帝国主义及其走狗和国内反动派的入侵进行战斗的标语口号。
    在会议上，古巴工人联合会总书记强调了在古巴民族主权受到国际寡头利益集团和美帝国主义威胁的时候“五一”游行对工人阶级和革命政府的重要意义。他指出，今年“五一”的集会将成为古巴历史上最有力的一次集会。
    会议通过了负责组织这次游行的中央委员会的任命。
    古巴工人联合会将向拉丁美洲所有的中央工会组织发出参加古巴的“五一”节活动的邀请。
    会议并且决定号召哈瓦那的所有工人参加3月20日开始的支援拉丁美洲人民周所指定的活动。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城19日讯：最近一期的“永久”周刊发表了古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚对墨西哥记者拉古纳斯的谈话。拉古纳斯不久前曾访问过古巴。
    罗亚说，“在推翻残酷、贪污腐化和卖国的巴蒂斯塔政权以前，古巴的外交政策曾经是别人用外国话在电话里加以支配的。革命正在改革着我国的经济结构和社会面貌，革命把国内外政策方面的真正主权交给了古巴政府和人民。古巴外交政策摆脱了使古巴遭受压迫和奴役的一切束缚。革命政府不需要任何人的保护和指使。我们希望同各国在完全平等和相互谅解的情况下和平相处。”
    罗亚说，革命政府过去履行，现在和将来仍要忠实地履行自己在拉丁美洲和国际上的义务，并要求其他国家也这样做。不允许同世界的一部分地区结成联盟来反对世界的另一地区。集团政策是对普遍和平的最可怕的危险。
    罗亚接着谈到古巴同苏联签订的贸易协定的意义。他说，我们的对外贸易在地区方面的过于集中是经济发展中的严重障碍，因此，我们要努力克服这种障碍，以便有可能在国外市场上自由行动。古巴早就向苏联出售糖，在这方面我们保证了扩大市场和苏联对我们的十分优惠的贷款。
    罗亚在谈到计划在古巴举行的不发达国家会议时表示希望，“美洲大陆上的所有国家政府都应像墨西哥、巴拿马和委内瑞拉政府那样支持这次会议。”
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚在今天向报界发表的声明中宣布，古巴政府已经指示它驻美国的外交代表要求美国政府逮捕巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的陆军总监何塞·埃莱乌特里奥·佩德拉萨，并且把他引渡给古巴政府。声明说，佩德拉萨被控犯有应该提交法庭审判的严重罪行。
    在美国庇护下的佩德拉萨目前正在美国的佛罗里达州策划组织同古巴革命政府对抗的“古巴流亡政府”。声明还宣布，古巴驻美国的代办已经根据古巴政府的指令，向美国政府提出关于引渡巴蒂斯塔的特务组织“老虎队”的头子罗兰多·马斯费雷尔的要求。
    马斯费雷尔目前还在美国指挥着颠覆古巴革命政府的活动。
    罗亚宣布，古巴驻墨西哥、危地马拉和智利的大使向古巴外交部报告：这三个国家的政府已经根据古巴革命政府提出的关于引渡古巴战犯的要求，拘留了五名古巴战犯。
