Xinhua News Agency, Kunming: Yunnan Province has begun harvesting spring crops, with over 1.6 million mu already harvested of wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, and other crops.

This year, Yunnan Province planted nearly 20 million mu of spring crops, an expansion of more than 4 million mu compared to last year. Thanks to the people's communes conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and overcoming natural disasters such as drought, insects, and diseases, crops such as wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed are growing very well. In Chengjiang, Yiliang, Jianchuan, Lijiang and other counties, the per-mu yield of over 10,000 mu of harvested broad beans has exceeded 500 jin, shaking off the historically low-yield label for broad beans.

To ensure that every grain returns home, every area is carefully harvesting and threshing, harvesting each piece as it ripens. In Xiangyun and other counties of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, field-side drying grounds and field-side threshing grounds are implemented during harvesting, which not only overcomes the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity but also reduces scattering. In Yongren District of Dayao County, each commune has done a good job in preparing for the harvest, achieving harvesting, threshing, and storage simultaneously.

Yunnan Province is currently in the tense season of fighting drought and transplanting rice seedlings. In order to solve the contradiction of harvesting and transplanting occurring at the same time, various localities have universally mobilized the masses to reform harvesting tools. Among the more than 14 million harvesting tools prepared before the harvest, there are more than 1,000 rapid harvesters and hand-cranked harvesters, and more than 16,000 threshing machines. In Yuxi and other counties, the use of a large number of harvesters has increased harvesting efficiency by half compared to previous years.

The bumper harvest of spring crops has greatly boosted the confidence of commune members in striving for a sustained leap forward in grain production. Many communes are selecting and reserving good seeds while harvesting, and are plowing, turning over the soil, and sowing seeds at the same time, striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops.

    云南开始春收
    澄江宜良等县蚕豆产量大大超过往年
    新华社昆明讯　云南省开始收割小春作物，已经收割小麦、蚕豆、油菜等一百六十多万亩。
    云南省今年种植小春作物近二千万亩，比去年扩大了四百多万亩。由于各人民公社认真地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，并且战胜了旱、虫、病等自然灾害，小麦、蚕豆、油菜等作物都生长很好。澄江、宜良、剑川、丽江等县已收割的一万多亩蚕豆，亩产都在五百斤以上，摘掉了历年蚕豆低产的帽子。
    为了做到颗粒还家，各地在收割中都是精打细收，熟一片收一片。大理白族自治州祥云等县，在收割中实行了田边晒场、田边碾场，不但克服了运输力不足的困难，还减少了抛撒现象。大姚县永仁区各公社，由于收割准备工作做得好，做到了随收、随打、随藏。
    云南省目前正是抗旱插秧的紧张季节，各地为了解决收割和插秧同时进行的矛盾，普遍发动群众改革收割工具。在收割前准备好的一千四百多万件收割工具中，有快速收割机、手摇收割机一千多部，脱粒机一万六千多台。玉溪等县因为大量使用收割机，使收割效率比往年提高了半倍。
    小春作物丰收，大大鼓舞了社员们争取粮食生产持续跃进的信心。许多公社在收割同时就选留了良种，并且边收割、边翻地、边播种，争取大春作物丰收。
