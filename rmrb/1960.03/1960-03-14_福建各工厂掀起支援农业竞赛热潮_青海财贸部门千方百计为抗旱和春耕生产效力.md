Fujian Factories Launch Competition Craze to Support Agriculture
Qinghai Financial and Trade Departments Make Every Effort to Serve Drought Resistance and Spring Ploughing Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) The broad masses of workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises in Fujian Province have enthusiastically responded to the proposal by the workers and staff of the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Lianjiang County Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the Shentan People's Commune Farm Implement Factory in Shouning County to launch a friendly competition to support agriculture, and a mass competition craze has been enthusiastically launched.
    The proposal of these three factories was published in the Fujian Daily on February 25, and more than two hundred units quickly responded enthusiastically.
    While responding to the proposal, the workers and staff of farm implement factories and machinery factories in various places immediately launched a competition to produce and repair spring ploughing farm implements. Many machinery factories and agricultural machinery factories in coastal areas are rushing to manufacture and repair irrigation and drainage equipment to support the fight against drought. Workers at the Putian County General Machinery Factory have been engaged in machine competition, opponent competition, and assembly line competition for days, determined to rush-produce fifty water pumps, eight power machines, and five water pumps in the shortest possible time. In the battle to rush-manufacture irrigation and drainage power equipment, the workers of the Longxi County Machinery Factory pushed the "thousand-hour" competition to a new climax. In the first three days of responding to the proposal, they put forward 110 rationalization proposals, and the average daily output value increased by 56.4% compared with the early and mid-February. The Zhangzhou Machinery Repair Factory and the Ruijin and Nanxing Brigades of the suburban People's Commune signed a contract, and repaired more than twenty agricultural machines for the brigades in three days. The Dongshan Wood Factory also transferred workers to set up two repair and parts outlets, and formed four professional repair teams to work in the countryside to rush-repair farm implements.
    In order to manufacture more, better, and greater quantities of agricultural machinery and farm implements, workers in various factories have been vigorously promoting the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations in the competition. Lian Jianhua, an old worker at the Fuzhou Power Machinery Factory, assisted the blanking group workers in designing and manufacturing a simple sand cleaning machine to replace manual labor, increasing work efficiency by thirty times.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The financial and trade departments of Qinghai Province are making every effort to serve drought prevention and resistance and spring ploughing production, and are vigorously supporting agricultural production. As of February 10, the province had supplied various medium-sized and small farm implements, irrigation and drainage machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides with a total value of 4.28 million yuan, basically achieving "supplies going ahead of the troops," ensuring the needs of spring ploughing production.
    While doing a good job in allocating and supplying materials under the state plan, the financial and trade departments also actively cooperated with local industries and people's communes to organize the production of local fertilizers, local pesticides, small farm implements, and other means of production. The Guanting Store in Minhe County, in cooperation with relevant industrial and agricultural departments, helped people's communes and production teams establish eleven large and small farm implement repair factories and twenty-six fertilizer factories, which have now repaired more than 470 farm implements and produced more than 37,000 jin of fertilizer and more than 3,000 small farm implements.
    Commercial departments in many areas have also organized technical personnel to carry tools and parts to repair farm implements in communes and production teams and help communes and production teams train technical personnel.
    In addition to assisting communes and teams in arranging the use of their own funds, finance and banking departments have also issued agricultural loans in a timely manner in conjunction with the supply of materials, providing sufficient funds for spring ploughing production. The Mutual Aid Branch of the People's Bank of China has now issued various loans of 39,200 yuan.

    福建各工厂掀起支援农业竞赛热潮
    青海财贸部门千方百计为抗旱和春耕生产效力
    本报讯　福建省各地工矿企业广大职工热烈响应省农业机械厂、连江县农业机械厂和寿宁县斜滩人民公社农具厂职工关于开展支援农业友谊竞赛的倡议，热烈掀起了群众性的竞赛热潮。
    这三个厂的倡议是在2月25日福建日报上发表的，很快就有二百多个单位热烈响应。
    各地农具厂、机器厂的职工在响应倡议的同时，马上掀起了大造大修春耕农具的竞赛运动。沿海地区的许多机器厂、农业机械厂都突击赶制检修排灌设备，支援抗旱斗争。莆田县通用机器厂的工人连日来机台竞赛、对手竞赛、一条龙竞赛搞得热火朝天，他们决心在最短期间赶制五十台抽水机、八台动力机、五台水泵。龙溪县机器厂的工人在突击制造排灌动力设备的战斗中，把“千台时”竞赛推向了新的高潮，在响应倡议的头三天提出合理化建议一百一十条，平均日产值比2月上旬、中旬提高56．4％。漳州机修厂和市郊人民公社的瑞金、南星等大队签订了合同，三天中就为各大队修理了二十多台农业机械。东山木工厂还抽调职工成立两个修配门市部，并组成四个专业修配队下乡工作，赶修农具。
    为了更多更好更大量地制造农业机械和农具，各厂工人在竞赛中都大搞手工操作机械化半机械化。福州动力机器厂老工人连建华协助整坯组工人设计，制造了一台简易清砂机，代替手工劳动，工效提高了三十倍。
    本报讯　青海省财贸部门千方百计地为防旱抗旱和春耕生产服务，有力地支援了农业生产。到2月10日为止，全省供应各种中、小型农具、排灌机械、化肥、农药总值达四百二十八万元，基本上做到了“兵马未动，粮草先行”，保证了春耕生产的需要。
    财贸部门在做好国家计划分配的物资的调拨供应工作的同时，还积极协同地方工业和人民公社，组织土化肥、土农药、小农具和其他生产资料的生产。民和县官亭商店协同工农业有关部门，帮助人民公社生产队建立了大小农具修配厂十一个，化肥厂二十六个，现已修配农具四百七十多件，生产出化肥三万七千多斤和小型农具三千多件。
    许多地区的商业部门还组织技术人员携带工具和零件，下社下队流动修配农具，帮助公社和生产队培训技术人员。
    财政、银行部门除协助社、队安排使用好自有资金外，还结合物资供应及时发放了农贷，给春耕生产准备了足够的资金。人民银行互助支行现已发放各种贷款三万九千二百元。（附图片）
