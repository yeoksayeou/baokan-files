Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 28th. The Central Financial and Trade Department of the CPC convened an on-site conference on financial and banking work and enterprise financial work in major and medium-sized cities across the country in Shanghai from March 4th to 14th. It called on urban finance, banking, and enterprise finance departments across the country to launch a new high tide of collaboration from all parties, participation in production, and large-scale mass economic accounting movement to vigorously support the current increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and promote the high-speed development of production and construction.

The meeting was presided over by Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Central Financial and Trade Department of the CPC. More than 1,400 representatives attended the meeting, including representatives of financial and trade ministers, finance department (bureau) chiefs, bank presidents from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and financial cadres at all levels; there were also some leading cadres in charge of financial work in economic departments such as industry, transportation, and commerce, as well as accounting staff from grassroots enterprises. The meeting focused on introducing the experiences of the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Banking Department in serving the central work of the Party, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, closely cooperating with all parties, and supporting and promoting the high-speed development of production and construction. It also exchanged advanced experiences from other regions. More than 80 speeches and written submissions introducing experiences were delivered at the meeting. Jin Ming, Deputy Minister of Finance, Cao Juru, President of the People's Bank of China, and Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, delivered reports at the conference. Minister Ma Mingfang gave a concluding speech to the conference. He demanded that through this meeting, the financial and banking work and enterprise financial work should be promoted to a new stage of development, so that the financial and banking work and enterprise financial work can achieve greater and better results in 1960.

The meeting focused on discussing two important issues: (1) The financial and banking sector should further strengthen the production perspective, face production, cooperate with all parties, and serve production. (2) Continue to deepen the mass economic accounting movement.

The meeting believed that the active participation of the financial sector in production and promotion of the development of production is a fundamental issue in correctly handling the relationship between finance and the economy. Many typical experiences at the meeting proved that financial institutions that wholeheartedly serve production and assist enterprises in developing production themselves perform their business work vividly and colorfully; financial institutions that confine their work to a narrow business circle and do not care about production inevitably find their financial and banking work bleak and unremarkable. The meeting affirmed the practice of the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Banking Department in delving into the production process and assisting enterprises in solving problems through economic activity analysis, believing that this is an effective way for the finance and banking departments to promote production and is worth popularizing throughout the country. The meeting pointed out that in order to better promote the high-speed development of production, the finance and banking sector must also actively participate in and organize socialist large-scale collaboration between various departments and units. Through collaboration, help enterprises solve difficulties in terms of funds, materials, technology, and labor to ensure the smooth progress of production.

The meeting discussed in detail the issue of factories and enterprises deepening the mass economic accounting movement, and also studied the issue of organizing workers' lives.

Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Central Financial and Trade Department of the CPC, pointed out at the end of the meeting that the series of issues discussed at this conference can be summarized into two most basic points: one is to closely integrate financial and banking work with production and construction, and support and promote the high-speed development of production and construction; the other is to combine financial and banking work with the broad masses, better serve the masses, and work with the masses to do a good job in financial and banking work. Adopting such a work line and work method will produce positive and good results in raising the political awareness of the masses, giving play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and in developing production and construction and carrying out financial and banking work.

    中共中央财贸部在上海召开现场会议交流先进经验
    据新华社上海28日电　中共中央财贸部3月4日到14日在上海召开了全国大中城市财政银行工作、企业财务工作现场会议，号召全国城市财政、银行和企业财务部门掀起一个协作各方、参与生产和大搞群众性经济核算运动的高潮，大力支持当前以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，促进生产建设的高速度发展。
    会议由中共中央财贸部部长马明方主持。出席会议的代表共一千四百多人，其中有各省、市、自治区的财贸部长、财政厅（局）长、银行行长和各级财政金融干部的代表；也有工业、交通、商业等经济部门主管财务工作的部分领导干部和基层企业的财会工作人员。会议着重介绍了上海市财政银行部门服务党的中心工作，大搞群众运动，密切同各方面协作，支援和促进生产建设高速度发展的经验，也交流了其他地区的先进经验。在会上介绍经验的发言和书面发言共八十多篇。财政部副部长金明、中国人民银行行长曹菊如、中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋，分别在大会上作了报告。马明方部长最后给大会作了总结。他要求通过这次会议，把财政银行工作、企业财务工作推向一个新的发展阶段，使财政、银行工作、企业财务工作在1960年获得更大、更好的成绩。
    会议着重讨论了两个重要问题：（1）财政银行部门进一步加强生产观点，面向生产，协作各方，为生产服务的问题。（2）继续深入开展群众性经济核算运动问题。
    会议认为，财政金融部门积极参与生产、促进生产的发展，是正确处理财政和经济关系的一个根本问题。会上许多典型经验证明，凡是赤心为生产，协助企业发展了生产的财政、金融单位，他们本身的业务工作也就做得生动活泼，有声有色；凡是把自己的工作局限在狭小的业务圈子里，不关心生产，财政银行工作本身也必然冷冷清清，成绩不大。会议肯定了上海市财政、银行部门深入生产过程，通过经济活动分析，协助企业解决问题的做法，认为这是财政、银行部门促进生产的有效途径，值得在全国普遍推广。会议指出，为了更好地促进生产的高速度发展，财政银行部门还必须积极参与和组织各部门、各单位之间的社会主义大协作。通过协作，帮助企业解决资金、物资、技术、劳力等方面的困难，以保证生产的顺利进行。
    会议详细讨论了工厂企业深入开展群众性经济核算运动问题，也研究了组织职工生活的问题。
    中共中央财贸部部长马明方在会议结束时指出，这次大会讨论的一系列问题，归纳起来最基本的有两个：一是把财政银行工作同生产建设紧密结合起来，支持和促进生产建设的高速度发展；一是把财政银行工作同广大群众结合起来，更好地为群众服务，并同群众一起做好财政银行工作。采取这样的工作路线和工作方法，对于提高群众的政治觉悟，发挥群众的革命积极性和创造性；对于发展生产建设，开展财政银行工作，都会产生积极的良好的结果。
