To Support Agricultural Technology Transformation and Help Farmers Combat Drought:
    Shaanxi Sends 5,000-Strong Technical Force to the Countryside
    Inner Mongolia's Industrial Departments Actively Produce and Repair Irrigation and Drainage Machinery

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 11th) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has selected 5,000 outstanding workers to form a technical team to go to the countryside to vigorously support agricultural technology transformation and the current fight against drought. This team was dispatched to people's communes throughout the province on March 2. The members of this team are mainly technical workers from machinery factories in industrial cities such as Xi'an and Baoji, as well as some engineering teachers and students from universities and colleges. Factories that transferred workers also drew a number of Party branch secretaries and Party group leaders from workshops to take on leadership roles.

According to the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee, this worker technical team must work in the countryside for at least one month. Given the current drought situation in spring, their task is to repair irrigation and drainage machinery as quickly as possible, as well as tractors, transport vehicles, and farming implements; and to help install new equipment, providing technical assistance to small factories in the people's communes. Through this work, they will launch a province-wide agricultural machinery inspection and repair campaign, so that idle machinery and equipment, especially irrigation and drainage equipment, can be quickly put into operation and投入抗旱斗争。 The Provincial Party Committee requires that the workers sent to the countryside not only repair the machinery, but also be responsible to the end, helping the communes formulate regulations for machinery operation and maintenance, and widely disseminate technology to commune members during the repair process. If necessary, they should sign apprenticeship contracts, guaranteeing teaching and learning, with each person taking one to three apprentices, so that "the person leaves, but the technology remains" when they leave. The members of the worker teams should do a good job of publicizing the worker-peasant alliance and agricultural modernization, make friends with farmers, and establish close ties. The factories that send out workers should gain an in-depth understanding of the most urgent needs for agricultural technology transformation through their own workers and cadres, in order to further improve support work; at the same time, through this support, they should connect with the people's communes, undertaking fixed-point technical contracting for one county or one commune in the future, and providing long-term assistance in repairing equipment and training technical personnel, etc.

Under the leadership of the secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee in charge of industry, relevant provincial departments and factories have made full preparations for the workers to go to the countryside. Commercial departments have tried every means to prepare various mechanical parts, which are currently being distributed to various places in batches; for parts that are in short supply, they are organizing a crash production and procurement campaign to ensure supply. Provincial industry, agriculture, commerce, and materials supply bureaus have also jointly formed a leading group for the production and repair of agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment. Currently, a mass movement to support agriculture through a crash inventory clearance is underway in major industrial cities. Industrial departments have already drawn a batch of power machinery for supporting facilities and will adopt three methods of borrowing, renting, and selling to supply to people's communes in various places.

According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, the characteristics of this year's support for agricultural and pastoral production by industrial departments in various leagues and cities of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are specific and effective leadership, early arrangements, and quick action. Currently, a mass industrial support movement focusing on the production and repair of agricultural and pastoral irrigation and drainage machinery is underway in various places.

According to incomplete statistics for the entire region by the end of February, 570 horsepower of various power irrigation and drainage machinery, 730 kilowatts of water turbines, 420 agricultural pumps, and 161 waterwheels have been produced, along with a large number of new-style plows, seeders, small farm tools, etc. While focusing on the manufacture of agricultural and pastoral irrigation and drainage machinery, various places have also vigorously grasped the repair and maintenance of agricultural and pastoral irrigation and drainage machinery. Many areas have prioritized the repair and maintenance of agricultural and pastoral machinery, ensuring immediate repair upon arrival and avoiding delays in use; fixed and mobile repair services are carried out simultaneously. Fixed repair stations are established at larger water conservancy construction sites and major transportation lines, and a large number of blacksmiths, carpenters, and other workers are organized to go deep into communes, management areas, and production teams to repair and maintain machinery and tools. In Zhaowuda League's Kalaqin Banner, Chifeng City, Ongniud Banner, and Balinyou Banner alone, more than 3,000 workers were drawn to form more than 300 mobile repair teams, which repaired and maintained more than 50,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral machinery and tools for communes and teams. From January 1 to February 20, a total of more than 270,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral irrigation and drainage and processing machinery and tools were repaired and maintained throughout the region.

In order to ensure that the manufacture and repair of irrigation and drainage power equipment and agricultural tools are ahead of the agricultural season and better meet the urgent need for drought resistance and seed preservation, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's Agricultural and Pastoral Department and the Industrial Department jointly convened a telephone conference on March 9 to accelerate the manufacture, repair, and supporting supply of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery, requiring all localities to make every effort to complete the manufacture, repair, and supporting tasks of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery in March and quickly deliver various products to the countryside.

    支援农业技术改造  帮助农民战胜旱魔
    陕西五千人技术大军下乡
    内蒙古工业部门积极赶制和修配排灌机具
    本报西安11日电　中共陕西省委挑选了五千名优秀工人，组成技术队伍下乡，大力支援农业技术改造和当前的抗旱斗争。这支队伍已于3月2日分赴全省各地人民公社。这支队伍的成员主要是西安、宝鸡等工业城市的机械厂的技术工人，还有一些大专院校的工科师生。抽调工人的工厂还抽出一批车间党支部书记和党的小组长，担任领导工作。
    按照省委要求，这支工人技术队伍最少要在农村工作一个月。根据当前春旱的情况，他们的任务是尽先修理好排灌机械，还有拖拉机、运输车辆和耕作机具；并且帮助安装新设备，给人民公社的小工厂以技术上的帮助。通过这一工作，展开一个全省农业机械大检查、大修配的运动，使停车的机械设备，特别是排灌设备迅速转动起来，投入抗旱斗争。省委要求下乡的工人不仅要把机械修理好，还要负责到底，帮助公社制订机械操作维修的规程制度，并在修理过程中，向社员广泛传授技术。必要时要订师徒合同，包教保学，每人带一到三个徒弟，作到离开时“人走技术在”。工人大队的队员们要作好工农联盟和农业现代化的宣传工作，和农民交朋友，建立亲密的联系。派出工人的工厂要通过自己的工人和干部深入了解农业技术改造最迫切的需要，以便进一步作好支援工作；同时，通过这次支援，和人民公社接线挂钩，在今后固定对一个县或一个公社进行技术包干，长期帮助修理设备和培训技术人才等。
    在中共陕西省委负责工业的书记挂帅领导下，省级有关部门和工厂为工人下乡进行了充分准备。商业部门千方百计地预备了各种机械配件，目前正在分批发往各地；对于数量不足的配件，正在组织突击生产和采购，以保证供应。省级工业、农业、商业和物资供应等厅、局还联合组成农业排灌设备生产、修配领导小组。现在，一个以支援农业的突击清仓的群众运动正在各主要工业城市展开。工业部门已经抽出一批动力机械进行配套，将采取借、租、售三种方法，供各地人民公社使用。
    据内蒙古日报消息　领导具体有力，安排早，行动快，是今年内蒙古自治区各盟、市工业部门支援农牧业生产的特点。目前，一个狠抓农牧排灌机具生产和修配的群众性的工业支援农牧业的运动，正在各地展开。
    全区到2月底的不完全统计，已生产各种动力排灌机械五百七十马力，水轮机七百三十瓩、农业用泵四百二十台、水车一百六十一台，并生产了大批的新式犁、播种机、小农具等。在狠抓农牧业排灌机具制造的同时，各地还大抓了农牧排灌机具的修配工作，许多地区都做到了对农牧机具修配优先安排，做到随到随修，不误使用；固定和流动修配并举，在较大的水利工地，主要运输线路，设立固定修配站，还组织了大批铁匠、木匠和其它工人，深入公社和管理区、生产队修配机具。仅昭乌达盟的喀喇沁旗、赤峰市、翁牛特旗和巴林右旗等，就抽调了三千多名工人组成三百多个流动修配小组，为社、队修配农牧机具达五万多件。从1月1日到2月20日，全区共修配农牧排灌及加工机具二十七万多件。
    为了使排灌动力设备和农具的制造和修配走在农事季节的前面，更好地满足当前农业抗旱保种的迫切需要，内蒙古党委农牧部和工业部在3月9日，联合召开了加速农田排灌机械制造、维修配套供应电话会议，要求各地在3月份全力突击完成农田排灌机械制造、维修、配套任务，迅速把各种产品送到农村。（附图片）
