    The Capital's Hygiene Blitz Kicks Off
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th – Over 880,000 people in the capital today vigorously engaged in collective and environmental sanitation, kicking off the hygiene blitz campaign to welcome "May Day."
    The most active today were the cooks and childcare workers from the newly organized thousands of street factories, canteens, and childcare organizations. After arranging their day's work early in the morning, they began sweeping rooms, wiping tables, and cleaning windows. In the West District, all large and small medical institutions dispatched more than 800 medical personnel to conduct health check-ups for the staff of newly established canteens, childcare organizations, and service stations in the streets, and to assist in carrying out hygiene work. Medical personnel in the East District also went to the streets this morning to inspect and promote, helping to improve hygiene and disease prevention work. In the Chongwen District, fifty medical personnel visited homes to teach cooks, childcare workers, and health workers hygiene knowledge.
    Today, various government agencies, factories, and schools also sent out large numbers of shock brigades, carrying brooms and other tools to clean streets, parks, stations, and other public places. The city's food and non-staple food industries, in conjunction with the characteristics of spring disease prevention, conducted thorough cleanups. The Qianmen Xianyukou Food Store washed all furniture and utensils with water, and nine employees climbed on ladders to scrub the roof beams with cloths.
    Beijing held a mobilization meeting on the 18th for over 4,000 people to welcome the "May Day" patriotic hygiene movement. This cleanup is to adapt to the new tasks and new requirements for hygiene work after the urban residents are organized in production and life. The first phase of cleaning in urban and suburban areas will begin on the 20th and end on the 26th.
