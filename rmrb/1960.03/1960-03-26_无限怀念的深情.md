China News Workers Delegation Visit to North Korea Communication

	Profound Feelings of Infinite Remembrance
	Xihong
	We bid farewell to the land of the Chollima, alongside the Taedong River,迎着in the golden-red morning glow.

	The rumbling train carried us away from Pyongyang. Mountains, rivers, and fields of friendship flashed by the window one after another. We truly had indescribable attachment and excitement in our hearts, truly a thousand words to express our reluctance to part.

	Recalling the days of the Chinese news workers delegation's visit to North Korea, we received so much profound kindness and warmth. In the many cities and villages we visited, from factories to cooperatives, from Premier Kim Il-sung to every ordinary North Korean, everyone warmly greeted Chairman Mao and the people of our country, and everywhere we could feel the North Korean people's profound feelings of infinite remembrance for the Chinese People's Volunteers.

	I remember in the spacious and bright reception room of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, the respected leader of the North Korean people, Premier Kim Il-sung, with a warm smile, shook hands firmly with each of us, making us once again deeply feel the everlasting friendship between the people of North Korea and China. We entered the Premier's reception room as if ascending to the peak of friendship; the potted iron tree beside the Premier, with its lush foliage, was a symbol of evergreen friendship.

	During the month of our visit to North Korea, how much dust had we traveled? What kind of visits had we made? Was it hot or cold? Premier Kim Il-sung inquired about everything. Then, the Premier smiled and spoke earnestly. From the famous Unsan battlefield on the banks of the Kuryong River to the snowy and desolate Changjin Plateau, where the First Division of the US Marine Corps was buried; from the recovery and construction of the heroic capital Pyongyang to the watery rice paddies around the Jianlong Reservoir. No matter where he spoke, the Premier was filled with enthusiastic praise and deep remembrance for the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Premier also said to us:

	"The Volunteers fought and lived together with us for eight years! It has been a year since the Volunteers withdrew from North Korea! Some Volunteer comrades stayed in North Korea for eight years; North Korea can be said to be their second hometown, and not one of them didn't cry when they left! ... Please tell me, comrades, has the feelings of our people for the Volunteers diminished?" The Premier's kind and moving voice also expressed the North Korean people's praise and remembrance for the Chinese People's Volunteers.

	What kind of language should we use to express this incomparably deep friendship between the people of North Korea and China? What kind of words should we use to describe the North Korean people's deep affection for the Chinese People's Volunteers?

	As soon as the Chinese news workers delegation arrived in Unsan, a blaze of friendship dazzled our eyes. We saw the golden Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery on Guishan, reflecting the Heroic North Korean Mother An Ok-hee Martyrs' Cemetery on Songxian Mountain. The China-North Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, named in memory of the Volunteers' merits, is located in the middle of these two cemeteries. Every morning, the children of Unsan Elementary School and the Young Pioneers of Unsan Middle School send two small teams, carrying brooms and singing songs, to clean these two cemeteries separately. How did the Volunteer Army uncles eliminate the American devils in the Unsan area? How did Mother An Ok-hee save the Volunteer Army scout Uncle Li Zhihuang with her own life? Everyone knows. The people of Unsan are using the internationalist spirit of Martyr An Ok-hee and the Volunteer Army martyrs to cultivate the noble hearts of a new generation. During the delegation's visit to Unsan, many elderly people and children surrounded us, talking about North Korea's An Ok-hee and the Chinese Volunteer Army; filled with mourning for the martyrs, filled with the noble friendship of the "Benevolent and Righteous Army" Volunteers.

	The snowy and desolate Changjin Plateau, more than 1,000 meters above sea level, left us with a deep impression. On the day we arrived at Changjin Lake, we went to the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery to lay wreaths, and a large group of North Korean comrades holding pink flower branches quietly followed us to the cemetery to offer flowers to the Volunteer Army martyrs. We went down the mountain and walked back, and this group of North Korean comrades followed us back to the warm living room. It turned out that these people were all guerrillas on Changjin Lake that year, each with a period of difficult friendship with the Volunteers, climbing ice and lying in snow, fighting side by side. They were precisely with these unforgettable friendships, bringing the good news of socialist construction on the plateau, surrounding us, talking and talking, until late at night, before reluctantly bidding us farewell. They also told us with excitement to convey to the Chinese mothers who lost their loved ones on the banks of Changjin Lake: The people on the banks of Changjin Lake will always regard the Chinese children resting here as their own relatives. During the rainy season last year, the days when mountain torrents broke out on the Changjin Plateau, how anxious they were when they looked at the tombs of the Volunteer Army martyrs in the valley that were about to be flooded! So men and women, disregarding the North Korean custom of not being able to move graves casually, braved the storm and rain, rushing to move these tombs one by one to the high slopes. They protected the martyrs' tombs with lofty love, protecting our friendship. How strong internationalist feelings they showed for the Chinese children who sleep on the banks of Changjin Lake!

	We also made a special visit to another China-North Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative near Pyongyang. We stayed there for a whole day, and in the evening we danced and sang with the members, enjoying the warmth of friendship. In this joyful visit, many members were reminded of their memories of the Volunteer Army. They mentioned that the Jianlong Reservoir here was destroyed by American planes during the war. The North Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers jointly erected anti-aircraft guns, fighting in the air while helping the local people to repair the reservoir, ensuring a bumper harvest of rice in this area. They said: "Our cooperative is famous for its rice and cotton. To commemorate the friendship of the Chinese People's Volunteers, we named the cooperative China-North Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative." Now, the rice here has bumper harvests every year. When people eat the snow-white rice, looking at the newly built buildings, pavilions, newly planted flowers and trees around the Jianlong Reservoir, and the yachts that are shallowly placed on the sandy shore, they can't help but think of the Chinese People's Volunteers who risked enemy bombing here and jointly repaired the reservoir with them. At present, this cooperative has completed water conservancy and is moving towards mechanization. When we left, the male and female members asked us to convey how much kind greetings to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, who visited this cooperative the spring before last year, to the people of our country and to the Chinese People's Volunteers!

	We once returned to the heroic Pyongyang along the road that the American devils fled south from Unsan and Jiachuan, which is also the road of friendship for the Volunteer Army to advance victoriously. Outside the Seven Star Gate in Pyongyang, we passed the Friendship Tower with awe. Under the beautiful Peony Peak, we have admired the scenery of friendship on Mao Zedong Street and Kim Il-sung Square more than once. We were also deeply moved by the friendship forged with the blood of the heroic sons and daughters of China and North Korea in the Korean War Liberation Memorial Hall, and our mood was unable to calm down for a long time.

	Sariwon, south of Pyongyang, was a transportation hub from the rear to the front during the war. In order to prevent the Korean and Chinese people and troops from supporting the front, the US imperialists dropped twelve bombs on every square meter of land in Sariwon, turning this city with a population of more than 50,000 into only three broken walls. After the armistice, the Volunteer Army comrades immediately extended the hand of friendship to help the people of Sariwon carry out restoration and construction work. Now it has become a prosperous, beautiful, and friendship-filled modern city. In order to commemorate the Volunteer Army, the people of Sariwon specially named a street built by the Volunteer Army and them, which is more than 3,000 meters long, "Volunteer Army Street". When we came here for a visit, we saw that this wide and straight Volunteer Army Street had been paved with cement; rows of prefabricated buildings of more than four floors had been built on both sides of the street. In the cold winter, many North Korean comrades are still singing songs, digging canals along "Volunteer Army Street", building lakes, planting green pines, and casting a golden bronze statue for their most missed Volunteer Army relatives. When the Volunteer Army withdrew, this was a must-pass place for all kinds of people. The people of Sariwon once stood at the head of "Volunteer Army Street", beating long drums, sprinkling pollen, and tearfully bidding farewell to the last Volunteer Army soldier. They forged the deepest friendship with our Volunteer Army. When we met "Volunteer Army Mom" Liu Mei in Sariwon, the old woman rubbed her hands and said with her head down: "I burst into tears when I saw Chinese comrades. There is nothing else, I am a mother, the more I feel that I live happily, the more I miss the Volunteer Army comrades."

	Late one night on the east coast, we also met several ordinary North Koreans who came from afar to visit the Chinese news workers delegation. Under the bright electric light, a North Korean rural woman stretched out two strong hands, reverently holding a silver hairpin, and walked towards us. This is Li Yushan, the lover of internationalist martyr Park Jae-geun. Her hands trembled under the light, and her eyes looked at us as if she had a lot to say, but she stammered a few sentences and couldn't continue. It can be seen that her mood was too excited. Finally, she simply told us that she was willing to give this silver hairpin to the Chinese people. This silver hairpin was what she wore when she married Park Jae-geun at the age of twenty, and she has carefully preserved it for twenty-eight years. Since her husband gave his great life for the Volunteer Army, this silver hairpin has become the most meaningful souvenir in her life. The small hairpin has brought her many happy memories, and also brought her many sad tears, and at the same time radiated such proud brilliance! We told her that the Korean people have already given the stretcher that Martyr Park Jae-geun used before his death to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Museum, and her silver hairpin will be exhibited with that stretcher in the future. Aunt Li Yushan nodded and smiled, and then said: "I don't know where the Volunteer Army comrade that my husband rescued is now, and I don't know what his name is. How much I hope to see his letter, I hope he can send a photo, and I also hope to correspond with his family." She cherishes friendship so much!

	Behind the light stood a young man with thick black eyebrows, who was Lu Junyuan, who carried a stretcher with Martyr Park Jae-geun to the front line to rush to transport Volunteer Army wounded. With crystal tears in his eyes, he narrated to us the scene before and after Martyr Park Jae-geun's death. Park Jae-geun's mission had been completed that day and he could have gone home. However, he was unwilling to go back. He said: "I will try to carry one more trip today and go back tomorrow." That night, they encountered American planes, and bombs exploded around them one after another. Park Jae-geun threw himself on the Volunteer Army wounded, protecting the wounded with his own body. At that time, one of his legs was blown off. However, when he regained consciousness slightly, he first asked if the Volunteer Army comrade was injured? Before he stopped breathing, he also said: "I am already in my forties, and it doesn't matter if I die. The Volunteer Army comrades are all young people. They came from China to help us fight against the American imperialists. We must take good care of them so that they can return home sooner and reunite with their families." He also told Lu Junyuan to tell his relatives to take good care of the Volunteer Army.

	Park Jae-geun's daughter, Park Sook-young, stood up from her mother's side and said to us: "As the daughter of an internationalist martyr, I feel very honored! I will inherit my father's cause and contribute everything I have to the friendship between the North Korean and Chinese people."

	These friendly visits, these unforgettable meetings, and these beautiful talks are still vividly in front of our eyes. The friendship forged with the blood of the people of China and North Korea is forever touching people's hearts!

	Today, North Korea in the era of Chollima is building a socialist paradise on earth. A brand new life has already unfolded before people's eyes. Bright houses have replaced the dark air-raid shelters. Rice paddies full of fat and fragrant apple orchards have long ended the spring famine years of eating bitter vegetables in the war years. Countless high-rise buildings on the ground have forever buried the ruins of war disasters. The smoke of war has dissipated, and the landscape with colorful clouds is so beautiful. The Volunteers, who bled with them during the war and lived in air-raid shelters together; and after the armistice, sweated with them and rebuilt their homes together, although far away from them, in their beautiful hearts, they cannot be separated from the figures of the Volunteer Army comrades for a moment. Many gray-haired Amani silently said to the photos of the worn-out Volunteer Army soldiers on the wall: "These are all my Adui'er (i.e. sons)!" Many kind-hearted women still keep the little bit of Chinese flour left to them by the Volunteer Army comrades before they left in earthen jars. At the moment when they miss their relatives every festival, they dig a little out, fry offerings, and go to the nearby Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery to pay tribute. There are also many North Korean comrades who, whenever they encounter any grand gatherings, prefer to wear the faded military uniforms left to them by their Volunteer Army comrades, and bring the commemorative badges and notebooks given to them by their Volunteer Army comrades, to participate in the meeting. In this way, they will feel that on the battlefield of Chollima, their close comrades-in-arms, the Volunteer Army comrades, are still shoulder to shoulder, closely following them.

	What could be more noble than this in the world? The people of one country can be so affectionate towards the army of another country! An army of one country will leave such a good name in another nation! This kind of thing can only happen in fraternal countries under the leadership of the Communist Party. In a blink of an eye, it has been more than a year since the Chinese People's Volunteers left North Korean soil. However, the North Korean people's remembrance of them has become deeper and deeper with the passage of time. How much the North Korean people hope that the Volunteer Army comrades and the Chinese people can know more about their glorious days of colorful clouds today!

	It is precisely because of this reason that during the days when the Chinese news workers delegation made a friendly visit to North Korea, how strongly the North Korean people deeply entrusted their love and longing for Chairman Mao, for the Chinese people, and for our Volunteer Army to us ordinary Chinese guests. Wherever we went, there would be pollen like colored clouds raised; wherever we went for visits, there would be a festive atmosphere. Time and time again, when we were still fifteen or even twenty miles away from our destination, the enthusiastic hosts had already rushed from afar, stopped by the highway, and waited for our car to arrive before greeting us and shaking hands with us. Schoolchildren carrying schoolbags, in twos and threes of Young Pioneers, as long as they saw our car passing by, they would immediately stop by the highway, bow deeply to us, and wave to us with smiles. The girls from the agricultural cooperative, just returning from the fields, walked into the club, gently spinning their pink skirts, and sang and danced for us to their hearts' content. The old Amani, carrying a heavy box of apples, climbed over mountains and ditches, blocked the road to stop the car, and insisted that we take this little intention with us before they would leave. Old uncles and old grandmothers, grabbing our hands, asked Chairman Mao how he was! The young workers, some asked about Anshan Iron and Steel, some asked about Shijingshan, and some asked about the masters during their internship in our country. The Young Pioneers of Changjin Plateau also inquired about how the children of No. 11 Elementary School in Xiamen insisted on studying amidst the roar of artillery fire on the front line. ...

	It was with such lofty friendship that we, fully loaded, greeted the evening cooking smoke of Sinuiju, greeted the lights of Andong, and reluctantly stepped onto the Yalu River Iron Bridge. Goodbye, brave and lovely North Korean people! Farewell, rich and beautiful North Korean rivers and mountains! China and North Korea will always be soil-connected and heart-connected. The flowing water of the Yalu River will forever and ever sing tirelessly for the friendship between our two peoples!

专栏：中国新闻工作者代表团访朝通讯

    无限怀念的深情
    西虹
    我们迎着金红色的朝霞，在大同江畔与千里马的国度告别了。
    隆隆前进的列车，载着我们离开平壤。一座座山、一道道河和一处处友谊的田野，接连着从车窗外闪过去。我们心中真有说不出的眷恋和激动，真有千言万语诉不尽的离情。
    回想中国新闻工作者代表团在朝鲜访问的这些日子，我们所承受的隆情厚意真是太多、太重了。在我们所到过的许多城市和乡村，从工厂到合作社，从金日成首相到每一个普通的朝鲜人，人人都在热情地问候毛主席和我国人民，处处都能感受到朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军那无限怀念的深情。
    记得在劳动党中央宽敞明朗的会客厅，敬爱的朝鲜人民的领袖金日成首相，带着深情的微笑，和我们每个人紧紧地握手，使我们又一次深刻地感受到朝中两国人民那万古长存的友情。我们走进首相的会客厅，就像走上友谊的高峰；首相身旁那棵盆栽的铁树，枝叶茂密，正是常青的友谊的象征。
    在朝鲜访问的一个月中，我们经历过多少风尘？作过些什么访问？是热，还是冷？金日成首相样样都询问。往下，首相又边笑边谈，语重心长。从九龙江畔著名的云山战场，到风雪茫茫、埋葬美国海军陆战第一师的长津高原；从英雄首都平壤的恢复和建设，到见龙水库一带水汪汪的稻田。不论谈到哪里，首相对我国人民志愿军都充满了热情的赞颂和深切的怀念。首相还向我们说：
    “志愿军和我们在一起共同战斗、共同生活了八年！志愿军撤离朝鲜也已经一年了！有些志愿军同志一直在朝鲜呆了八年，朝鲜可以说是他们的第二故乡，走时没有一个不哭的！……请同志们谈谈，我国人民对志愿军的感情是不是减少了？”首相的亲切动人的声音，也正表达了朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的赞颂和怀念。
    我们该用什么样的语言，来表达朝中两国人民这无比深厚的友谊呢？我们该用什么样的字眼，来形容朝鲜人民对我国人民志愿军一往情深的怀念呢？
    中国新闻工作者代表团刚到云山，一片友谊的光辉耀花了我们的眼。我们看到，桂山上面那座金煌煌的志愿军烈士陵园，辉映着松仙山上英雄的朝鲜母亲安玉姬烈士陵园。为纪念志愿军的功勋而命名的朝中友谊农业社，正在这两个陵园的中间。每天早晨，云山小学的小朋友和云山中学的红领巾，都要派出两个小队，扛着扫把，唱着歌，分别去打扫这两个陵园。志愿军叔叔是怎样在云山地区消灭美国鬼子的？安玉姬妈妈是怎样用自己的生命，救出了志愿军的侦察员李治黄叔叔的？孩子们谁都说得出。云山人民正是用安玉姬烈士和志愿军烈士的国际主义精神，来培养一代新人的高尚的心灵。代表团在云山访问期间，多少老年人和小朋友紧紧地围着我们，谈了朝鲜的安玉姬，又谈中国志愿军；满怀着对烈士的悼念，满怀着对“仁义之师”志愿军的高尚友情。
    风雪茫茫，海拔一千多米的长津高原，给我们留下的印象真是太深了。到达长津湖那天，我们去志愿军烈士陵园献花圈，一大群手捧粉色花枝的朝鲜同志，也静静地跟着我们去陵园，给志愿军烈士献花。我们下山往回走，这群朝鲜同志又跟随我们回到温暖的客厅。原来这些人都是当年长津湖上的游击队员，每个人都有一段与志愿军一起爬冰卧雪，并肩作战的患难友谊。他们正是怀着这些难忘的友谊，带着高原上社会主义建设的喜讯，围拢我们，谈呀谈的，直到夜深了，才依依不舍地和我们告别。他们还怀着激动的心情，让我们转告在长津湖畔失去亲人的中国母亲：长津湖畔的人民永远把安息在这里的中国儿女，当作自己的亲人。去年雨季，长津高原上爆发山洪的那些日子，他们望着山谷里面即将被洪水淹没的志愿军烈士的陵墓，心中是多么焦急啊！于是男男女女，顾不了朝鲜民间不能随便迁坟的习俗，顶着暴风雨，抢着把这些陵墓一座一座地迁移到高高的山坡上。他们用崇高的爱保卫了烈士的灵墓，保卫了我们的友谊。他们对长眠在长津湖畔的中国儿女，是表现了多么强烈的国际主义的感情！
    我们还特地去访问了平壤附近的另一个朝中友谊农业社。在那里整整呆了一天，晚上又和社员们在一起歌舞联欢，享受友谊的温暖。就在这欢悦的访问中，不少社员都勾起了对志愿军的怀念。他们谈到战时这里的见龙水库曾被美国飞机炸坏，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军共同架着高射炮，一面对空作战，一面帮助当地人民抢修水库，保证了这一带水稻的丰收。他们说：“我们这个社的稻子和棉花都很出名，为了纪念中国人民志愿军的友谊，我们把合作社命名为朝中友谊农业社。”现在，这里的水稻年年丰收，当人们吃着雪白的稻米，瞅着见龙水库周围那新修的楼房、凉亭、新栽的花木，以及浅搁在沙岸上的游艇的时候，他们就不由的想起曾经在这里冒着敌机轰炸，和他们共同抢修水库的中国人民志愿军。目前，这个社已经完成了水利化，正在向机械化前进。当我们离开的时候，男女社员们嘱托我们向毛主席和前年春天曾经访问这个社的周总理，向我国人民和我国人民志愿军，转致多少亲切的问候啊！
    我们曾经沿着云山、价川，这条当年美国鬼子向南逃跑的道路，也就是志愿军乘胜前进的友谊的道路，返回英雄的平壤。我们在平壤的七星门外，以肃然起敬的心情经过友谊塔。我们在秀丽的牡丹峰下，不止一次地欣赏过毛泽东大街和金日成广场的友谊风光。我们还在朝鲜解放战争纪念馆，深深地为朝中两国英雄儿女用鲜血结成的友谊所激动，心情久久不能平静。
    平壤以南的沙里院，是战时从后方到前线的交通要点。美帝国主义者为了阻挡朝、中人民和部队支援前线，曾经在沙里院每一平方米土地上投下十二颗炸弹，把这座五万多人口的城市，炸得只剩下三堵破墙。停战后，志愿军同志立即伸出友谊的手，帮助沙里院人民进行恢复建设工作。现在这里已经变成了繁华美丽、充满友谊景象的现代化城市。沙里院人民为了纪念志愿军，特意把志愿军与他们一起修建的一条长达三千多米的大街，命名为“志愿军街”。当我们来这里进行访问的时候，看见这条宽广笔直的志愿军街，路面上已经铺上水泥；街道两旁盖起了一排排四层以上的装配式楼房。在寒冷的冬季，多少朝鲜同志还在唱着歌，顺着“志愿军街”开挖运河，修造湖泊，栽植青松，并且为他们最怀念的志愿军亲人，铸造金光灿烂的铜像。当志愿军撤军时，这里是各路人马必经之地。沙里院人民曾经在“志愿军街”头，敲着长鼓，洒着花粉，含着热泪，送别了最后一名志愿军战士。他们与我国志愿军结下了最深的友谊。当我们在沙里院会到“志愿军妈妈”柳梅的时候，老人家搓着手，低着头说：“我一见中国同志就流泪。没有别的，我是妈妈，我越感到自己生活过得幸福，就越想念志愿军同志。”
    在东海岸上的一个深夜，我们还曾会见过几位远道来看望中国新闻工作者代表团的普通朝鲜人。在雪亮的电灯下，一位朝鲜农村妇女，伸出两只有力的大手，虔诚地捧着一只银亮的发簪，向着我们走来了。这是国际主义烈士朴在根的爱人李玉善。她的双手在灯光下颤抖着，两眼望着我们，像有许多话要说，但是断断续续地说了几句就说不下去了。可以看出，她的心情是太激动了。最后，她只简单地向我们说，她愿意把这只银发簪赠送给中国人民。这只银发簪是她在二十岁上与朴在根结婚的时候戴的，她已经经心地保存了二十八年。自从她的丈夫为了志愿军献出了他的伟大的生命以后，这只银发簪就成了她生活中最有意义的一件纪念品。小小的发簪，曾经给她带来多少幸福的回忆，也给她带来多少悲痛的眼泪，同时又向她放射出多么自豪的光辉！我们告诉她，朝鲜人民已经把朴在根烈士生前用过的那副担架赠送给中国人民解放军博物馆，她的这只银发簪将来也会跟那副担架在一起展出。李玉善大嫂点头笑了笑，接着又说：“我丈夫救活的那位志愿军同志，现在不知道在什么地方，也不知道他叫什么名字，我是多么希望看到他的来信，希望他能寄张照片来，我还希望跟他的家属通信。”她是这样珍念友谊！
    灯影后面还站着一位双眉浓黑的青年人，这正是当时和朴在根烈士抬着一副担架，去前线抢运志愿军伤员的卢俊元。他含着晶莹的泪花，向我们叙述朴在根烈士遇难前后的情景。朴在根的任务那天已经完成，本来可以回家的。但是，他不愿意回去。他说：“今天争取多抬一趟，明天再回去。”就在那天夜里，他们遇上了美国飞机，炸弹接连在周围爆炸。朴在根奋不顾身地扑在志愿军伤员身上，用自己的肉体护住了伤员。当时，他的一条腿被炸断了。但是，当他稍稍恢复知觉的时候，首先就问志愿军同志负伤了没有？临停止呼吸，他还说：“我已经是四十多岁的人，死了没关系。志愿军同志都是青年，他们从中国来帮助我们打美帝国主义，要好好照顾他们，让他们能早点回国，跟亲人团聚。”他还嘱咐卢俊元转告自己的亲人，要好生爱护志愿军。
    朴在根烈士的女儿朴淑英，从母亲身旁站起来，也向我们说：“作一个国际主义烈士的女儿，我感到很光荣！我要继承父亲的事业，为朝中人民的友谊贡献出我的一切。”
    这些友谊的访问，这些难忘的会见和这些动听的言谈，直到现在，都还活生生地浮现在我们眼前。中朝两国人民那用鲜血凝成的友谊，永远都在扣动着人们的心弦！
    今天，千里马时代的朝鲜，正在建设着社会主义的人间乐园。人们面前已经展开了崭新的生活。明亮的住宅代替了黑漆漆的防空洞。满眼肥美的稻田和芬芳的苹果林，早已结束了战争岁月那苦菜充饥的春荒年成。地面上数不尽的高楼大厦，永远埋葬了战灾的废墟。战烟消散，彩霞万道的江山，是这样如花似锦。那在战时与他们一起流血，一起住防空洞；而在停战后，又与他们一起流汗，一起重建家园的志愿军，虽然远远地离开了他们，但是在他们那美丽的心灵中，一刻都离不开志愿军同志的形影。多少发髻苍苍的阿妈妮，她们对着墙壁上那些磨旧了的志愿军战士的照片，默默地说：“这都是我的阿堆儿（即儿子）！”多少慈心的妇女，至今还把志愿军同志临走前留给她们的一点点中国面粉，保存在瓦缸里。在每逢佳节倍思亲的时刻，她们就挖一点出来，炸了供果，去附近的志愿军烈士陵园里奠祭。还有不少朝鲜同志，每逢遇到什么隆重的集会，放着新衣不穿，偏要穿上志愿军战友留给他们的褪色的军服，带上志愿军战友送给他们的纪念章、笔记本，去参加会议。这样一来，他们就会感到，在千里马的战场上，亲密的战友志愿军同志，仍然并肩携手，紧紧地跟他们在一起。
    世界上还有什么比这更高贵的感情？一个国家的人民对另一个国家的军队，能够这样钟情！一个国家的军队在另外一个民族中间，会留下这样的美名！这种事情，只有在共产党领导下的兄弟国家才能发生。我国人民志愿军离开朝鲜国土，一晃眼，已经一年多了。但是，朝鲜人民对他们的怀念，反而随着时间的前进，越来越深了。朝鲜人民是多么希望志愿军同志和中国人民，能够更多地知道，今天他们这满天彩霞的光辉日子啊！
    正是由于这样的原因，当中国新闻工作者代表团在朝鲜作友好访问的那些日子，朝鲜人民是多么强烈地把他们对毛主席、对中国人民和对我国志愿军的热爱和想念，深深地寄怀于我们这些普普通通的中国客人。我们走到哪里，那里就扬起彩霞般的花粉；我们去到哪里访问，那里就过节似地掀起一片欢腾。一次又一次，我们离目的地还有十五里，甚至二十里，热诚的主人早已远道赶来，停在公路旁，等我们的车一到，就迎上来跟我们握手。背着书包的小学生，三三两两的红领巾，只要看着我们的车经过，马上就会在公路旁停步，深深地向我们鞠躬，笑嘻嘻地向我们招手。农业社的姑娘们，刚刚从田间归来，就走进俱乐部，轻轻地旋动粉裙，为我们尽情地歌舞。年老的阿妈妮顶着沉甸甸的一箱苹果，翻山过沟，拦路挡车，硬要我们把这点心意带上才肯走。老伯伯、老祖母，抓着我们的手，开口就问毛主席好！年青的工友们，有的问候鞍钢，有的问候石景山，有的问候在我国实习期间的师傅。长津高原的红领巾，还打听厦门市十一小学的小朋友，怎样在前线炮火的轰鸣中坚持读书。……
    我们正是满载着这样崇高的友谊，迎着新义州的晚炊，迎着安东的灯火，离情依依地跨上鸭绿江大铁桥。再见，勇敢可爱的朝鲜人民！别了，富饶美丽的朝鲜河山！中国和朝鲜，永远是土相接，心相连。鸭绿江的流水，将永远地、永远地为我们两国人民的友谊，歌唱不息！
