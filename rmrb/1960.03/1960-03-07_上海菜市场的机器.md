Machines in Shanghai Vegetable Markets

    At the Shanghai Chezhan Road small vegetable market, just as the opening bell rang, bursts of "rumbling, rumbling" machine noises emanated from each stall.

    Next to a meat stall on the north side, a woman in her forties wanted to buy twelve taels of lean meat. The salesperson picked up a miniature meat-cutting machine that looked like a pistol, and with a "zip" sound, a piece of lean meat was cut off; one weigh-in revealed it was exactly twelve taels.

    An elderly female customer, having bought hairtail, was preparing to go home, passing by a machine. The salesperson asked with a smile, "Granny, would you like the scales scraped off?"

    The old woman handed the hairtail to the salesperson, the machine roared, and in a short while, the two hairtail were not only scraped clean but also had their innards removed, heads and tails chopped off, and were cut into sections. The old woman said happily, "This saves me a lot of trouble."

    In this very vegetable market, there are now more than forty machines with over thirty different uses. Throughout the entire market, from chopping meat, scraping scales, cutting vegetables, peeling skins, to washing vegetables, raising fish, making fish balls, and even counting tickets, new machinery has appeared, basically realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    Mechanization and semi-mechanization have brought immense convenience to the vegetable market's salespersons. In the past, salespersons had to use a seven-jin heavy meat axe to chop meat, otherwise, they couldn't break the bones. Even a strong young man would be exhausted after chopping for four hours straight. Now, using machines, half a pig can be cut up in just one minute. Furthermore, large vegetable cutting machines can cut 1,200 jin of vegetables per hour, an efficiency sixty times higher than manual operation. Electric shredders and slicers have an efficiency forty times higher than manual operation.

    上海菜市场的机器
    在上海车站路小菜场里，开市的铃声刚刚响过，从各个摊头就发出了阵阵“轰隆、轰隆”的机器声。
    在靠北的一个肉摊旁，一位四十多岁的妇女要买十二两精肉，营业员拿起一只像手枪似的微型切肉机，吱地一声，一块精肉切了下来；一称，不多不少正是十二两。
    一位年老的女顾客，买好带鱼准备回家，走过一部机器旁边。营业员笑嘻嘻地问道：“老太太，要不要刮鳞？”
    老太太把带鱼交给营业员，机器轰隆一响，一会儿的功夫，两条带鱼不但刮得清清爽爽，还挖去了内脏，斩去了头尾，切成一段一段的。老太太高兴地说：“这可省我再麻烦啦。”
    就在这个菜场里，现在已有四十多部具有三十多种不同用途的机器。整个菜场，从斩肉、刮鳞、切菜、剥皮，到洗菜、养鱼、捏鱼丸以至点票等，都已出现了新的机械，基本上实现了机械化、半机械化。
    机械化、半机械化给菜场的营业员们带来了莫大的方便。过去，营业员斩肉，一定要用七斤重的大肉斧，否则就不能把骨头斩断。一个年轻力壮的小伙子连斩四个钟头，也会累得筋疲力尽。现在，使用机器，只要一分钟就可以开好半只猪。再如大型切菜机，一个钟头可以切一千二百斤菜，效率比手工操作提高了六十倍。电动刨丝切片二用机，效率比手工操作提高四十倍。
