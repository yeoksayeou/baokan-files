    Huaiyuan Red Flag Commune Self-Built Local Railway Unleashes Ideological Emancipation of Cadres and Masses Throughout the Region
    Bengbu Special Zone's Mass Construction of Local Railways Brings Numerous Benefits
    Masses Display Ingenuity, Self-Casting Rails, Self-Manufacturing Locomotives; Four Local Railways Connect Factories, Mines, and Warehouse Docks
    Hefei, March 14th (Report from our newspaper) The Bengbu Special Zone in Anhui Province has mobilized the masses to rely on their own efforts and has built four local railways in Bengbu City and the nearby Fengyang and Huaiyuan counties. The usage of these railways proves that building local railways is a good way to solve local transportation problems with little effort and great results.
    These four local railways are: 1. Fengmen Local Railway: From Bengbu Iron and Steel Plant to Fengyangshan Iron Mine in Fengyang County, 32 kilometers long. 2. Local railway from Bengbu Iron and Steel Plant to the West Suburb Industrial Zone by the Huai River, 2 kilometers long. 3. Hexia Line Local Railway from more than a dozen warehouses and factories in Bengbu City to Wharf No. 3, 1.1 kilometers long. 4. Commune Local Railway of Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County to the Huai River, 3 kilometers long, directly connecting the central Changfen Township of the commune to the Huai River Wharf. These local railways ensure the normal supply of ore and coal for the iron and steel plant, solve the busy short-distance transportation problem, and save a large number of labor and transportation tools. For example, the Feng (yangshan) Lin (qiao) section of the Fengmen Local Railway, which has been opened to traffic, is 13 kilometers long and saves the 36 trucks, 500 flatbed carts, 70 five-ton wooden boats, and thousands of laborers that were originally responsible for this section of transportation. The daily transportation volume has increased from about 1,000 tons to 2,000 tons. The West Suburb Industrial Zone Local Railway transports Huainan coal from the wharf to the iron and steel plant, saving the 1,500 people and 1,000 flatbed carts that were originally responsible for transportation. The freight cost has been greatly reduced, and the freight price per ton-kilometer of coal has dropped from 80 cents to 5 cents. The porters here said: "The little train, it whistles, the transportation efficiency is really high; put down the flatbed cart, and never carry bags again."
    Like other regions, the Bengbu area has found that its transportation capacity cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production since the Great Leap Forward. Last year, the Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County, with almost no technical foundation, the masses themselves cast iron rails, modified gas engines and diesel engines into locomotives, and established a three-kilometer-long local railway. Since then, the vast majority of agricultural and sideline products, industrial products, fertilizers, and other materials transferred in and out of the Hongqi People's Commune have been transported through this local railway, greatly saving labor and improving transportation efficiency. The emergence of this small local railway greatly liberated the minds of the vast number of cadres and masses in other regions. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately proposed building local railways to solve local transportation problems, and put forward the slogan that local railways "must be piloted to the end, and we will never stop until we win a complete victory." The Bengbu Prefectural Committee and Municipal Committee resolutely responded to the call, held on-site meetings, and strengthened organizational work at the same time. Command headquarters were established in the special zone, city, county, and factories and people's communes with local railway construction, and the party committee secretary personally took charge.
    The Bengbu Regional Party Committee also vigorously mobilized the masses and supported the experimental work of the masses. The manufacturing technology and material sources for the rails and locomotives of the local railways were all solved by the region relying on its own efforts. Che Xueshi and Hou Leting, five porters from Bengbu City, were the first to respond to the call of the Party Committee and experimented with casting rails. With the support of the Party, they started from scratch, established a rail casting factory, built two sheds with straw mats as factory buildings with waste materials, used gasoline drums to make iron melting furnaces, used hand-cranked wooden blowers from the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production to blow air, made their own sand-turning tools, and everyone seriously studied rail casting knowledge, worked hard, and after more than 20 failures, they finally cast a small section of rail. They said, "With a small section of rail, there is no worry about not having a large section of rail; with one rail, there is no worry about not having thousands of rails." Their enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger, and the Minister of Transportation of the Prefectural Committee also moved to live in the factory and worked with the workers to overcome technical difficulties, and finally cast "丄" type rails and "I" type rails. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of rail casting, the workers constantly innovated technology. Some people who did not know how to draw, dug yellow mud to make models. They carried a ball of mud with them to work and off work, and made models in their spare time to improve the casting method. Within more than 20 days, they created 19 major innovations such as the open mold casting method and the live casting open mold method, which increased work efficiency by three to ten times respectively. The open mold casting method increased the finished product rate of rails from 50% to 95%. The rails cast by this factory were used to pave the Fengmen Local Railway, the West Suburb Industrial Zone Local Railway, and the Wharf No. 3 Railway. The usage situation proved that the quality was very good. Locomotive manufacturing and road construction were also carried out by launching a mass movement and large-scale communist cooperation. More than 40 factories in Bengbu City participated in the manufacturing of local railway equipment. Five machinery factories cooperated to modify 300-horsepower diesel locomotives, automobiles, and gas locomotives. The work-study factories of more than ten schools and 30 street factories were responsible for manufacturing the spikes, screws, and splints needed for the rails. A total of 290,000 people in the region participated in road construction and paving. If the masses did not know how to build roads, they would ask old workers or technicians from the Bengbu Railway Bureau to teach them. The side slopes, curves, and curves of the railway were first made as models by the leading cadres of road construction, and on-site meetings were held to impart technology, and then the masses built the roads, and the technicians collected the squares. After the Fengmen Railway adopted this method, the roadbed was built in one month, and the quality was the same as that required by the large-scale railway, five meters wide, layer of soil, layer of compaction, and the thickness of the bottom base and stone ballast and pit wood all met the standards. Except for the 80 meters that were initially built by railway workers, the rest of the track laying and spike nailing work on the Bengbu West Suburb Industrial Zone Local Railway was done by the masses themselves. The materials for the local railways were all solved locally. Only a small amount of steel used for locomotives and modified locomotives was partially assisted by the province.
    According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Bengbu Special Zone and Bengbu City will continue to build local railways and small foreign railways this year, and strive to have railways in every county within two or three years to form a local railway network.

    怀远红旗公社自办土铁路　全区干部群众思想大解放
    蚌埠专区大办土铁路好处极多
    群众发挥聪明才智自铸铁轨自造机车，四条土铁路贯通工厂矿山和仓库码头
    本报合肥14日电　安徽省蚌埠专区发动群众，自力更生，在蚌埠市和蚌埠市附近的凤阳、怀远县修建了四条土铁路。这些铁路的使用情况证明：修建地方铁路，是解决地方运输的一项费力小、收效大的好办法。
    这四条土铁路是：一、凤门土铁路：由蚌埠市蚌埠钢铁厂到凤阳县凤阳山铁矿，长三十二公里。二、蚌埠钢铁厂到淮河边的西郊工业区土铁路，长二公里。三、蚌埠市十几个仓库、工厂到三号码头的河下线土铁路，长一点一公里。四、怀远县红旗人民公社到淮河边的长三公里的公社土铁路，由公社的中心常坟乡直通到淮河码头。这些土铁路保证了钢铁厂的矿石、煤炭正常供应，解决了繁忙的短途运输问题，节省了大批劳动力和运输工具。如凤门土铁路已通车的凤（阳山）林（桥）段，十三公里，节省了原来担任这段运输的三十六部汽车、五百辆平板车、七十只五吨木船和上千的劳动力，日运量由原来的一千吨左右增加到两千吨。西郊工业区土铁路把淮南煤从码头运到钢铁厂，节省了原来担任运输的一千五百人和一千辆平板车，运费大大降低，煤吨公里运价由八角降为五分。这里的搬运工人说：“小火车，呜呜叫，运输效率实在高，放下平板车，从此不扛包。”
    蚌埠地区和其他地区一样，大跃进以来，运输能力不能满足工农业生产飞跃发展的需要。去年，怀远县红旗人民公社在几乎毫无技术基础的条件下，群众自己铸出了铁轨，用煤气机和柴油机改制成机车，办起了一条三公里长的土铁路。从此，红旗人民公社调出调入的农副产品、工业品、化肥等物资，绝大部分通过这条土铁路运输，大大节约了劳动力，提高了运输效率。这条小土铁路出现后，大大解放了其它地区广大干部和群众的思想。中共安徽省委立即提出修建土铁路解决地方交通问题，并提出土铁路“要试办到底，不获全胜，决不收兵”的号召。蚌埠地委、市委坚决响应号召，召开了现场会议，同时加强了组织工作。专区、市、县及有土铁路建设的工厂和人民公社都成立了指挥部，由党委书记亲自挂帅。
    蚌埠地区党委并大力发动群众，支持群众的试验工作。土铁路的铁轨和机车车辆的制造技术和材料来源都由本地区自力更生解决。蚌埠市车学仕和侯乐亭五位搬运工人首先响应党委号召，试验铸造铁轨。他们在党的支持下，白手起家，办铸轨厂，用废料搭起两间席棚子作厂房，用汽油桶做化铁炉，用大办钢铁时的手摇木制鼓风机鼓风，自己做翻砂工具，每个人都认真学习铸轨知识，刻苦钻研，失败了二十多次，终于铸出一小段铁轨来。他们说：“有了一小段铁轨，不愁没有大段铁轨，有了一根，就不愁千根万根。”他们的劲头越来越大，地委交通部长也搬到厂里住，和工人一起攻技术关，最后铸出了“丄”型轨和“I”型轨。为了提高铸轨的效率和质量，工人们不断革新技术，有的人不会绘图，便挖黄泥捏模型，他们上班下班都带着一团泥巴，有空就做模型，改进浇铸办法，二十多天内，他们创造了明模浇铸法、活浇明模等重大革新十九项，工效分别提高三倍到十倍以上。明模浇铸法使铁轨成品率由50％提高到95％。这个厂铸出的铁轨铺凤门土铁路、西郊工业区土铁路、三号码头铁路，使用的情况证明质量都很好。机车制造和筑路，也是采取大搞群众运动和大搞共产主义协作的办法来进行的。蚌埠市有四十多个厂参加了土铁路设备制造工作。五个机械厂协作改制成了三百匹马力的柴油机机车、汽车和煤气机车。十多个学校的勤工俭学工厂和三十个街道工厂负责制造铁轨需用的道钉、螺丝、夹板。全地区有二十九万人次参加了筑路铺路。群众不会筑路便请蚌埠铁路局的老工人或技术员来教，铁路的边坡、弯道、曲线都由筑路领导干部先做样子，召开现场会议传授技术，然后由群众筑路，技术员收方。凤门铁路采用这个办法后，路基一个月就筑好了，质量和大洋铁路要求的质量一样，五米宽、层土层夯，底基、石渣厚度、坑木都合标准。蚌埠西郊工业区土铁路的铺轨钉道钉工作，除开始修建的八十米是铁路工人钉的外，其余都是群众自己钉的。土铁路的材料全部由本地解决。只有机车和改制机车用的少量钢材，一部分由省里帮助。
    蚌埠专区和蚌埠市根据省委指示，今年将继续大建土铁路和小洋铁路，争取两三年内县县能通铁路，形成地方铁路网。（附图片）
