Accelerate the Scientific Research on Comprehensive Utilization of Wood

Zhu Jiezi, Deputy Director of the Wood Industry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Forestry

Wood is closely related to socialist construction and the people's material and cultural life. The way wood is utilized is constantly changing with the development of processing technology and scientific culture. The higher the society's material civilization, the wider the ways of utilizing wood, and the more wood products are manufactured.

Over the past decade, under the leadership of the Party, China's forestry construction has achieved great accomplishments. In particular, the Great Leap Forward in the past two years has achieved unprecedented brilliant results. Taking the forest logging industry as an example, the timber output in 1949 was 5.67 million cubic meters, which increased to 41.2 million cubic meters in 1959, an increase of more than six times in ten years. The target of timber output for the Second Five-Year Plan was overfulfilled three years ahead of schedule, and China's timber output rose from 15th in the world in 1950 to 5th. In logging operations, state-owned logging enterprises in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia have greatly improved labor productivity by actively developing mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. In addition, new forest areas such as the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains, as well as Northwest and Southwest China, have been actively developed to increase new timber production bases. In order to rationally utilize forest resources, the Ministry of Forestry has formulated rational main felling methods and implemented artificial renewal as the main method, so that forest renewal can keep up with felling, so as to achieve the continuous utilization of forest resources forever. Many effective measures have also been taken in forest management and protection, and great achievements have been made.

With the rapid development of socialist construction, the production of timber and other forest products cannot fully meet the growing needs of various parties. China's existing forest area is about 97 million hectares, and the forest stock volume is about 6.3 billion cubic meters. The current timber production level is less than 0.1 cubic meters per capita. The solution to this supply and demand contradiction, in the long run, is large-scale afforestation and accelerated forest renewal. To this end, the Ministry of Forestry has proposed to vigorously build timber forests and actively carry out forest renewal, so that China will strive to reach a timber production level of about 0.5 cubic meters per capita in about 15 years. However, in reality, in order to meet the growing urgent need for timber, other measures must be taken, which is the comprehensive utilization of wood.

There are a large number of residues in the process of wood production and utilization. Generally speaking, the comprehensive utilization rate of wood in the felling and processing process is about 70%, and about 30% of the residues, such as branches, treetops, bark, cut ends, sawdust, etc., are treated as "waste." If the felling volume in 1959 is 41.2 million cubic meters, and the felling and processing residues are calculated at 30%, then the residues will reach about 13 million cubic meters. If 30% can be used to make fiberboard, it is equivalent to producing 3.9 million cubic meters of logs, which is a very large number.

Main ways of comprehensive utilization of wood

The center of comprehensive utilization of wood is to develop artificial board production, strive to improve the yield of sawn timber, vigorously develop fiberboard, and correspondingly develop plywood, particleboard, and blockboard to make up for the shortage of wood. And under the guidance of the policy of fully utilizing forest resources and comprehensively utilizing forest resources, vigorously develop the production of rosin, tannin extract, and wood hydrolysis, and correspondingly develop the production of forest chemical products such as wood dry distillation and cork. This mainly includes the following aspects:

Developing fiberboard is a major aspect of vigorously developing artificial board. Fiberboard uses a wide range of raw materials. In addition to felling and processing residues such as branches, bark, inferior wood, board ends, scrap boards, log cores, plywood edges, shavings, etc., shrubs and herbaceous plants can also be used. Generally, one ton of fiberboard requires 3.3 cubic meters of wood raw materials. Three-millimeter-thick hard fiberboard can replace twelve-millimeter-thick sawn timber thin boards. In terms of utilization area, one ton of fiberboard can replace 5.7 cubic meters of logs. Fiberboard is not only more uniform than natural wood in structure, but also eliminates the inevitable defects of natural wood such as knots, discoloration, decay, included bark, and wormholes; and it has the characteristics of being not easy to expand, shrink, warp, and crack, so it is called "flawless wood." Through oil immersion treatment or special processing, it can be waterproof, fireproof, anticorrosive, and acid-resistant, and can be used indoors and outdoors. Fiberboard has a wide range of applications, with more than 300 uses, and is developing rapidly. The world produced only 30,000 tons in 1922, and increased to 4.52 million tons in 1958. Since 1959, China's fiberboard industry has been producing fiberboard using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and the production capacity has been greatly improved, and small foreign clusters for continuous production have been created. While foreign methods can produce high-quality fiberboard, indigenous methods can also produce products that meet general needs. The manufacturing technology of fiberboard, especially the indigenous production technology, has been mastered by the vast areas of China.

Particleboard is also a type of artificial board, which can be made from wood waste or crop stems and stalks. 1.3 cubic meters of waste can be made into 1 cubic meter of particleboard, replacing 2 cubic meters of sawn timber, which can replace 3 cubic meters of logs. Particleboard requires the least raw materials and the manufacturing process is relatively simple. However, it requires a certain amount of synthetic resin glue. Particleboard has a flat and smooth surface and beautiful patterns, and can also be pasted with various veneers such as veneer, plastic or metal plates to make it more beautiful and durable. Particleboard is an industry that has developed rapidly in the past ten years. The production volume has increased rapidly. China started production in 1956. Recently, the Wood Industry Research Institute of the Academy of Forestry Sciences has successfully trial-produced cold-pressed particleboard with starch glue.

Plywood is made by rotary cutting logs into veneers, applying glue, arranging them vertically and horizontally according to the wood grain, and pressing them on a hot press. It can be made into three-layer, five-layer and seven-layer or more plywood. Since three layers of veneer are generally used, it is also called three-plywood. Manufacturing plywood can save wood. For example, one cubic meter of logs made into boards can only produce 58 square meters of 12 mm thin boards according to national standards, while the same logs made into three-layer plywood with a thickness of 3 mm can be made into 166 square meters, and the utilization area is about three times that of sawn timber. Secondly, various beautiful patterns can be pieced together according to the natural grain of wood for various decorations. And it can change the natural defects of wood and improve the use value of wood.

Develop glued components. In order to make small materials into large materials and short materials into long materials, small materials can be glued together into components for different purposes. The investment cost of establishing a glued splicing workshop is much smaller than the investment used to cut down timber and establish new logging enterprises. The cost of glued components is 20% lower than that of components made of whole pieces of wood. Glued components have been used in China. Shanghai Yangzi Wood Factory has applied the glued roof trusses produced by the factory to two newly built workshops in the factory. Glued components have also begun to be used in highway bridges. Other glued sleepers and glued pit props can turn small materials into large materials. The glued pit props researched by the Wood Industry Research Institute of the Academy of Forestry Sciences have been tested on site and simple processing equipment has been designed. The glued sleepers successfully researched by the Railway Science Research Institute have been laid and tested on the Beijing-Guangzhou line.

Sawdust utilization is a very important aspect. Sawdust accounts for about 8% in the lumber processing process. Sawdust can be mixed in fiberboard, with an addition amount of up to 50%. The static bending strength of the manufactured fiberboard reaches 140 kg per square centimeter. Sawdust plus magnesium oxide can be used to make artificial boards and artificial marble, which are beautiful and durable. Sawdust can be added to glue and pressed into molded products such as electricity meter boxes and radio shells, or it can be made into molded plastic products under high temperature and high pressure without adding glue.

Comprehensive utilization of wood can not only increase general wood products, but also can be made into high-grade products in economic construction. Its wear resistance is better than bronze and Babbitt alloy. For example, wood scrap bearings (including rolling mill bearings) are more durable than bronze bearings and do not require lubricating oil. Wood laminated plastic gears are not only durable and do not require lubricating oil, but also have very little noise during operation, and are called silent gears. The rolling mill bearings are now made of cloth laminated plastic, and 5 million square meters of high-quality fine cloth are consumed for every 1,000 tons of products. Not only can wood laminated plastic completely replace it, saving a large amount of cotton cloth needed for people's lives, but also its strength is higher than it. Wood laminated plastic has been produced in China and has begun to be used in rolling mill bearings, large hydropower station bushings, and giant water conservancy project gate slides. Another type of product called compressed wood is a product that turns inferior wood into superior wood after treatment under high temperature and high pressure. For example, the shuttles in the textile industry used to be made of rare Qinggang oak in China, and the wood utilization rate was only 10%, which was a great waste. Now compressed wood made of northeastern poplar with poor material can be used, and the service life is longer than that made of Qinggang oak. In addition, high-grade products of compressed wood and glued wood are not only used as special non-metallic materials in various heavy industries, but also materials used in aviation, ships, national defense military industry and other cutting-edge technologies.

Improving wood quality, extending wood service life, and improving wood utilization rate and yield to minimize residues are also important issues in practical work and scientific research. For example, after the wood is dried, the moisture content of the wood reaches equilibrium with the humidity of the local air, which can improve the strength of buildings and wood products, improve the quality of gluing and decoration, prevent deterioration and decay, reduce deformation, warpage and cracking, and extend the service life of the wood. The service life of dried wood is about ten times longer than that of wet wood. According to Beijing's estimate in 1958, about 20% of the wooden components in buildings crack and warp due to the direct use of wet wood, resulting in a great waste. Transporting dry wood can also save 50% of transportation capacity compared to newly felled wet wood.

Wood preservation is also a way to extend the service life of wood. The service life of preserved wood is generally increased by two times. Preserved sleepers can even be used for more than 30 years, while non-preserved sleepers are generally used for about 5 years. If 6 million cubic meters of wood need to be preserved and the service life is extended by two times, it is equivalent to producing more than 10 million cubic meters of logs for the country.

The development of comprehensive utilization of wood has greatly expanded the alternative resources of wood. For example, bamboo in China is abundant in resources, grows fast, and has high strength. The green part of bamboo can be used as laminated plastic for high-speed wear-resistant mechanical parts. The bamboo material successfully researched by the Wood Industry Research Institute of the Academy of Forestry Sciences is treated as a high-speed centrifugal yarn can in the textile industry. Under high-speed operation, its performance is superior to materials such as aluminum, steel, steel paper, and glass fiber reinforced plastic. Others, as rolling mill bearings, are more durable than cloth laminated plastic. The various high-grade products made can replace certain valuable alloy materials, and can even serve certain cutting-edge technologies. The yellow part of bamboo can be used to manufacture fiberboard. Even bitter bamboo, which was considered to have no use value in the past, has higher strength and more beautiful color than fiberboard made from wood raw materials. In addition, tree bark, pine needles, shrubs, grasses, reeds, tea stems, bagasse, and other gramineous plants such as rice straw and cotton stalks can be used as fiberboard raw materials. The potential in this regard is great. Artificial board production can also be combined with the comprehensive utilization of other light industries. In addition to using rice straw, wheat straw, sorghum stalks, and sugarcane to produce alcohol, oil, and sugar, the remaining waste can be used as raw materials for artificial boards.

Using chemical methods to process the residues in wood felling and utilization can produce more products. For example, a pine tree, if fully utilized, is a small chemical factory. In addition to the above-mentioned various uses, it can also produce rosin, tannin extract, alcohol, bakelite powder, activated carbon, acetic acid, etc. Sawdust can be hydrolyzed to obtain alcohol, which is an important raw material for synthetic rubber. It can also produce furfural and glucose; and can be used as feed. Wood can be dry-distilled to produce methanol, acetone, acetic acid, and wood tar. Rosin, turpentine, and tannin extract can be extracted from wood. Wood can be chemically treated to obtain rayon, pulp, etc. The products of comprehensive utilization of wood can reach more than 1,000 kinds.

The comprehensive utilization of forest fruit and oil crops also has great potential. For example, in addition to oil extraction from oil-tea seeds, the oil-tea shell can also extract tannin extract and other important products.

From the perspective of resource utilization, the existing potential for comprehensive utilization of wood is only the beginning of liberation. For example, the sulfite waste liquid of the paper industry can be used to manufacture vanillin, dispersant, preservative and boiler scale inhibitor in addition to extracting alcohol and tanning materials; sulfate waste liquid can be used to extract flotation agents for ore dressing, and 2 kg of turpentine and 1 kg of methanol can be recovered per ton of pulp. For example, the alkaline waste liquid in the fiberboard manufacturing process can also be used as a filler for wood adhesives; the residual lignin after wood hydrolysis can be used to make adhesives; and the residue after tannin extract extraction can be used as artificial boards.

Among the comprehensive utilization of various resources, the comprehensive utilization of wood with artificial boards as the main body occupies a particularly important position. It has opened up new ways to fully utilize forest resources and increase the production of a large amount of timber. It can not only save and replace various boards, making up for the shortage of wood, but also greatly extend the operating life of forest areas. This is of great significance for solving the contradiction between timber production and supply in China for a considerable period of time and accelerating the construction of forest areas.

Development prospects of wood utilization

Due to the development of science and technology, mankind's utilization of wood will inevitably enter a new stage. Now it can be imagined that in terms of lumbering, special high-frequency vibration may be used for cutting to realize sawdust-free lumbering. By using cutting-edge technology and treating wood with special physical or chemical methods, wood can be dried, preserved, fireproofed, and resistant to erosion. With the comprehensive development of science and technology, wood can reach various requirements in one treatment, which can not only extend its service life, but also achieve other required property variations. In terms of the performance of wood itself, the potential of wood has not been fully liberated. For example, the tensile strength of high-quality steel is only two to three times higher than the tensile strength of wood along the grain, but the specific gravity of steel is twelve to fifteen times greater than that of wood. From the comparison of strength and specific gravity, the tensile strength of wood should be four to five times greater than the strength of steel under the same weight. Therefore, improving the structure of wood and increasing the transverse strength of wood can greatly exert the great potential of wood itself. It can be imagined that one day, wood can be rolled like steel, and various properties, specifications, and models of square timber or boards can be rolled out after compression processing for different uses, thereby creating a compression processing combined machine to turn wood into various molded products of different specifications and standards. In this way, wood will not be used as a material as it is now, but as a raw material, and various products required by people will be obtained after various processing, so there will be no so-called "waste".

Strengthen Party leadership and launch mass movements

Comprehensive utilization of wood is a new thing. We must strengthen the leadership of the Party, launch mass movements, liberate our minds, break superstitions, mobilize all positive factors, and give full play to the great wisdom and potential of the masses. Li Fanwu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally took the lead. In the past two years, more than 500 comprehensive wood utilization factories have been developed, with a total output value of 210 million yuan, basically forming a forest product industrial base based on forest farm factory groups, with large and medium-sized modern enterprises as the backbone, and combining large, medium and small enterprises, with collaboration, division of labor and reasonable layout.

In the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement, there is a characteristic that leading cadres, technical personnel and workers are combined, professional research institutions are combined with mass innovation movements, and scientific research, education and production are combined. This is conducive to the combination of theory and practice, the combination of popularization and improvement, and the experimental research process is the process of promotion. The Leap Forward No. 1 fiberboard small foreign cluster born in Tianjin is a concrete embodiment of this combination. Raising red flags, establishing pace-setters, and launching the "learn, catch up, and surpass" movement are effective working methods of the mass line in various places.

The Party's general line for socialist construction and its two-legged walking policy are the source of strength for the great development of comprehensive utilization of wood. The development process of the fiberboard industry in the past year vividly illustrates this point. Experience has proved that there are 50,000 forest farms, more than 1 million workers, and most of them are located in mountainous areas. Among the more than 2,000 counties in the country, 1,200 counties are forest areas. Therefore, each forest farm must start with indigenous methods, diversify operations, and make comprehensive utilization. This is not only conducive to the year-round operation of the forest farm, improving the management level, and improving the living standards of employees, but also inspires employees to love the forest area and love wild resources, which is of great significance for consolidating the forest farm.

Promoting the communist style of cooperation is an important feature of the great leap forward in the comprehensive utilization of wood industry and scientific and technological work in the past two years. Comprehensive utilization of wood is a very complex and arduous task, which is closely related to several technical disciplines. It also involves many economic departments in terms of infrastructure, equipment and production. Through collaboration, we can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses in technology, exchange materials and resources, and give full play to the potential of human and material resources. The experience of comprehensive utilization of wood in Heilongjiang proves that the common cooperation of relevant departments is the most important condition for vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of wood.

Now the development of comprehensive utilization of wood industry and science and technology, like the entire national economy and science and technology front, is in an infinitely good situation. As long as we hold high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune, establish communist ambitions, continue to liberate our minds, and dare to think and dare to do, the comprehensive utilization of wood will surely reach a higher level.

    加速发展木材综合利用的科学研究工作
    中国林业科学研究院木材工业研究所副所长　朱介子
    木材与社会主义建设事业及人民物质文化生活的关系极为密切。利用木材的方式，也随着加工技术和科学文化的发展，不断起着变化：社会的物质文明愈高，利用木材的方式愈广，制造出来的木材产品也愈多。
    十年来我国林业建设事业，在党的领导下，取得了伟大的成就，特别是两年来的大跃进更取得了空前未有的辉煌成果。就森林采伐工业来说，1949年木材产量为五百六十七万立方米，到1959年则增到四千一百二十万立方米，十年中提高六倍多。提前三年超额完成第二个五年计划木材产量的指标，使我国木材产量从1950年的世界第十五位上升到第五位。在采伐作业中，东北、内蒙古的国营采伐企业由于积极发展了机械化、半机械化作业，大大提高了劳动生产率。此外，并积极开发大小兴安岭和长白山林区及西北、西南等新林区，增加新的木材生产基地。为了合理利用森林资源，林业部制订了合理的主伐方式，并实行以人工更新为主，使森林更新赶上采伐，以达森林资源能够永远连续利用。在森林经营及保护方面也采取了许多有效措施，获得了很大成就。
    随着各项社会主义建设事业一日千里地发展，木材及其他林产品的生产，还不能充分满足各方面日益增长的需要。我国现有森林面积约为九千七百万公顷，森林蓄积量约为六十三亿立方米，木材生产水平目前按人口平均每人还不足0．1立方米。解决这个供需矛盾的办法，从长远看，是大规模造林和加速森林更新。为此，林业部提出大力营造用材林，并积极进行森林更新，使我国争取在十五年左右，木材生产水平按人口平均计算达到0．5立方米左右。但从现实看，为了满足对木材日益增长的迫切需要，必须采取另外的措施，这就是木材的综合利用。
    木材生产及利用过程中有大量的剩余物存在。一般说来，采伐加工过程中，木材综合利用率约为70％左右，有30％左右的剩余物如枝丫、梢头木、板皮、截头、锯屑等，被当作了“废料”处理。如以1959年采伐量四千一百二十万立方米，采伐加工剩余物以30％计，则剩余物即达一千三百万立方米左右。如能利用30％作成纤维板，则等于生产三百九十万立方米原木，这是一个很大的数字。
    木材综合利用的主要途径
    木材综合利用的中心是发展人造板生产，努力提高锯材出材率，大搞纤维板，相应地发展胶合板、刨花板、细木工板，以补木材之不足。并在充分利用森林资源和综合利用森林资源的方针下，大力发展松香、栲胶、木材水解，相应地发展木材干馏、栓皮……等林化产品的生产。这主要有以下几个方面：
    发展纤维板是大搞人造板的一个主要方面。纤维板使用原料很广，除了采伐、加工剩余物，如枝丫、板皮、等外材、板头、碎片板、原木芯、合板边子、刨花等外，并可利用灌木及草本植物。通常一吨纤维板需要木材原料三点三立方米。三毫米厚的硬质纤维板可代替十二毫米厚的锯材薄板使用。在利用面积上，一吨纤维板可以代替原木五点七立方米。纤维板在构造上不仅比天然木材均匀，而且消灭了天然木材中不可避免的节疤、变色、腐朽、夹皮、虫眼等缺点；并且具有不易膨胀、收缩、翘曲、开裂等特点，因此被称为“无缺点的木材”。通过油浸处理或特殊加工，能防水、防火、防腐、防酸，室内室外皆可使用。纤维板应用范围很广，具有三百多种用途，发展很快。全世界1922年仅生产三万吨，1958年提高到四百五十二万吨。我国纤维板工业，自1959年以土法上马，土洋结合方式生产以来，生产能力大大提高，并已创造了连续式生产的小洋群。采用洋法固然能制造出质地很好的纤维板，用土法也能生产出合乎一般需要的产品。纤维板的制造技术，特别是土法生产技术已为我国广大地区所掌握。
    刨花板也是人造板之一种，既可利用木材废料，也可利用农作物茎、杆制成。一点三立方米废料可以制成一立方米刨花板，代替二立方米锯板材使用。可以代替原木三立方米。制造刨花板所用原料最省，制造过程也比较简单。但它需要一定数量的合成树脂胶。刨花板表面平正光洁，花纹美观，还可以粘贴各种贴面如单板、塑料或金属板等，使之更加美观耐用。刨花板是近十余年来新发展起来的一项工业，生产量增长很快，我国是在1956年开始生产的。最近林业科学研究院木材工业研究所用淀粉胶冷压刨花板已试制成功。
    胶合板是利用原木旋切成为单板，经过涂胶，按木材纹理纵横排列，在热压机上加压而成。可以制成三层、五层和七层以上的合板。因一般多用三层单板，所以也称为三合板。制造胶合板可以节约木材，如一立方米原木制成板材，只能产国定规格十二毫米薄板五十八平方米，而同样原木如制三层胶合板，厚度为三毫米，可以制成一百六十六平方米，利用面积约为锯材板的三倍。其次，还可按照木材天然花纹拼成各种美丽图案供作各种装饰用。并能改变木材的天然缺陷，提高木材的使用价值。
    发展胶合构件。为了使小材变为大材，短材变长材，可利用小料经过胶合拼成不同用途的构件。建立胶拼车间的投资费用要比采伐木材和建立新的采伐企业所用的投资小得多。胶合构件的成本比用整块木材制成构件低20％。胶合构件已经在我国应用，上海扬子木材厂已将本厂生产的胶合屋架应用于本厂两个新建的车间。在公路桥梁方面，亦开始应用胶合构件。其他如胶合枕木、胶合坑木，都能把小材变大材。林业科学研究院木材工业研究所研究的胶合坑木，已在现场进行试用并设计了简易的加工设备。铁道科学研究院研究成功的胶合枕木，已在京广线上铺设试用。
    锯屑利用是一个很重要的方面。在制材加工过程中锯屑达8％左右。锯屑可以掺在纤维板中，添加量达50％。所制成的纤维板静曲强度达到每平方厘米一百四十公斤。锯屑加菱苦土可以制人造板，作人造大理石，美观耐用。锯屑可以加入胶料在模型中压制成型制品如电表盒，收音机壳等，也可以不加胶料在高温高压下作成模制塑料制品。
    木材综合利用不仅可以增加一般木材制品，而且可制成经济建设中的高级制品。它的耐磨性能比青铜及巴比合金都为优良。如木材碎料轴瓦（包括轧钢机轴瓦）比青铜制的轴瓦耐用，而且不用润滑油。木材层积塑料制成的齿轮不但经久耐用，不用润滑油，而且在操作中噪声很少，称为无声齿轮。轧钢机轴瓦现均用布质层积塑料，每一千吨制品要耗五百万平方米上等细布。用木材层积塑料不但完全可以代替，节约人民生活所需要的大量棉布，而且强度还比它高。木材层积塑料已在我国生产，并已开始在轧钢机轴瓦及大型水电站轴套以及巨型水利工程闸门滑道方面试用。另外一种制品称为压缩木的，系经过处理，在高温高压下把劣材变为优材的一种制品。例如纺织工业中的梭子过去都用我国稀有的青岗栎等制造，木材利用率只有10％，浪费很大。现在可以用材质较差的东北白杨制成压缩木，而且使用寿命比青岗栎制的还长。此外，压缩木与胶合木的高级制品除用作为各种重工业方面的特殊非金属材料之外，还为航空、船舰、国防军工以及其他尖端技术方面所应用的材料。
    提高木材质量，延长木材使用寿命，提高木材利用率及出材率以尽量减少剩余物，也是实际工作及科学研究中的重要课题。如木材经过干燥，使木材含水率达到与当地空气的湿度相平衡，能提高建筑物与木制品的强度，改善胶合和装饰的质量，防止变质腐朽，减少变形、翘曲和开裂，延长木材使用年限。干燥过的木材使用年限约比湿材提高十倍以上。据北京市1958年估计，建筑物由于直接使用湿材，木材构件发生开裂翘曲的约占20％，造成很大浪费。运输干燥的木材比新采伐的湿材还可以节约运输力50％。
    木材防腐也是一种延长木材使用年限的办法。经过防腐的木材使用年限一般要提高二倍，经过防腐处理的枕木甚至可使用三十年以上，而未经防腐处理的枕木一般使用五年左右。如以需经防腐处理的木材六百万立方米，延长使用寿命二倍计，则等于为国家多生产一千多万立方米原木。
    木材综合利用的发展，大大扩大了木材的代用资源。例如，我国的竹子，资源丰富，生长快，强度高，利用竹青部分可以做为层积塑料，作为高速耐磨机械零件。林业科学研究院木材工业研究所研究成功的竹材经过处理作为纺织工业的高速离心纱罐，在高速运转下，性能比铝、钢、钢纸，玻璃钢等材料都为优越。其他作为轧钢机轴瓦比布质层积塑料耐用。所制成的各种高级制品可代替某种贵重的合金材料，甚至能为某些尖端技术服务。竹黄部分可以制造纤维板。甚至过去被认为没有什么利用价值的苦竹，制成的纤维板比木材原料所制成的强度还高，而且色泽美观。此外树皮、松针、灌木、草类、芦苇、茶叶梗、甘蔗渣，以及其他禾本植物如稻草、棉秆等，都可以作为纤维板原料。这方面的潜力是很大的。人造板生产还可与其他轻工业的综合利用结合，利用稻草、麦秆、高粱秆、甘蔗等制酒、榨油、制糖之外，所余废渣物均可作为人造板的原料。
    把木材采伐利用中的剩余物用化学方法加工，又可生产更多的产品。如一棵松树，充分利用起来，就是一个小小的化工厂。它除了上述各种用途外，还可生产松香、栲胶、酒精、电木粉、活性炭，醋酸等。锯屑经过水解可以得到酒精，作为合成橡胶的重要原料。还能生产糠醛和葡萄糖；并可做饲料。木材经过干馏可以生产甲醇、丙酮、醋酸、木焦油。从木材中可以提取松香、松节油和栲胶。木材经过化学处理，可得人造丝、纸浆等。木材综合利用的产品可达一千种以上。
    林木的果品和油料综合利用也大有可为。如油茶籽除榨油外，油茶壳还可提取栲胶等重要产品。
    从资源利用上看，现有木材综合利用的潜力，还仅是开始解放，如造纸工业的亚硫酸盐废液，除可提取酒精、鞣料外，还可以制造香草醛、分散剂、防腐剂和锅垢阻化剂；硫酸盐废液可提取选矿用的浮选剂，每吨纸浆可以回收二公斤松节油及一公斤甲醇。又如纤维板制造过程中的碱废液亦可以利用作为木材胶合剂的填料；木材水解后的残渣木素可以制胶合剂；以及栲胶提取后的残渣又可作人造板等。
    在综合利用各种资源中，以人造板为主的木材综合利用，占着特殊重要的位置。它为充分利用森林资源，增产大量木材开辟了新的途径。它既能节约代替各种板材，补上木材不足的缺口，又能将林区的经营年限大大延长。这对解决我国在相当长的时期内木材生产和供应之间的矛盾，加速林区的建设，具有很大的意义。
    木材利用的发展前景
    由于科学技术的发展，人类对木材的利用，也必将进入一个新的阶段。现在可以设想，在制材方面，可能应用特殊的高频震动进行切削，实行无锯屑制材。利用尖端技术，通过特殊的物理或化学方法处理，可使木材干燥、防腐、防火、耐浸蚀。随着科学技术的综合发展，可使木材在一次处理中即达到各种要求，既可延长使用寿命，又可做到其他要求的性质变异。就木材本身的性能来说，木材的潜力并没有完全解放出来。例如优质钢的抗拉强度只比木材的顺纹抗拉强度高二至三倍，但钢的比重却比木材大十二至十五倍。从这种强度和比重的比较上看，在同样重量下，木材的抗拉强度应比钢的强度大四至五倍。因此，改进木材结构，把木材的横纹强度提高，就可以大大发挥木材本身性能的巨大潜力。可以设想，会有那么一天，木材也可以像轧钢似的，经过压缩加工轧出来各种性能、规格、型号的方材或板材供不同的使用，从而创造出一种压缩加工联合机，使木材变成各种不同规格标准的成型制品。这样，木材将不是像现在这样的作为材料使用，而是作为原料，经过各种加工后得到人们所要求的制品，因而也就没有所谓“废料”存在。
    加强党的领导，大搞群众运动
    木材综合利用是一个新事物。必须加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，才能解放思想，破除迷信，调动一切积极因素，发挥群众的巨大智慧和潜力。中共黑龙江省委书记李范五同志亲自挂帅，二年来木材综合利用工厂发展五百余处，总产值达二亿一千万元，基本形成一个以林场工厂群为基础，以大中型现代化企业为骨干，大中小相结合、有协作分工和合理布局的林产工业基地。
    在群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动中，有一个特点，就是领导干部、技术人员与工人相结合，专业研究机构与群众革新运动相结合，科学研究、教育与生产相结合。这就有利于理论与实践结合，普及与提高结合，试验研究过程就是推广的过程。天津诞生的跃进一号纤维板小洋群，就是这种结合的具体体现。插红旗，树标兵，掀起“学、赶、超”运动，是各地行之有效的群众路线的工作方法。
    党的社会主义建设总路线及其两条腿走路的方针，是木材综合利用大发展的力量的源泉。一年多来，纤维板工业的发展过程即生动地说明了这一点。经验证明，我国五万个林场，百多万工人，绝大部分处在山区，全国二千多个县，有一千二百个县是林区。因此，每个林场必须实行土法上马，多种经营，综合利用。这不仅有利于林场常年作业，提高经营水平，提高职工生活水平，而且激发职工热爱林区，热爱野生资源，对巩固林场有重要意义。
    大兴共产主义的协作之风，是两年来木材综合利用工业和科学技术工作大跃进的一个重要特征。木材综合利用是一项很复杂艰巨的工作，它与若干技术学科有着密切的联系。在基建、设备和生产上又牵涉到许多经济部门。通过协作，可以在技术上取长补短，在设备物资上互通有无，充分发挥人力物力的潜力。黑龙江木材综合利用的经验证明，有关部门的共同协作，是大力发展木材综合利用事业最重要的条件。
    现在木材综合利用工业和科学技术的发展，与整个国民经济和科学技术战线一样，是形势无限好。只要我们高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，树立共产主义的雄心壮志，继续解放思想、敢想敢干，木材综合利用一定能够达到更高的水平。
