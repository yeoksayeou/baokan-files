Strive to Transform the Yellow River Irrigation Area into a "Riverside Paradise" with Fragrant Rice within Three Years
Ningxia Comprehensively Eradicates Saline-Alkali Land

(Our dispatch) The million Hui and Han people in the Yellow River irrigation area of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have begun to comprehensively and thoroughly eradicate soil salinization. Under the principle of "prevention first, combining prevention and treatment, water as the key, and comprehensive management," they are making comprehensive plans to basically prevent and eradicate land salinization within three years, transforming this irrigation area into a "Riverside Paradise" with fragrant rice.

Preventing and thoroughly eradicating soil salinization is one of the keys to implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and ensuring stable and increased agricultural production. Based on the new situation in current agricultural production development, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed a three-year plan for comprehensively eradicating soil salinization, building on the tremendous achievements made in improving saline-alkali land in the past. Once the plan is realized, the existing 3.2 million mu of cultivated land in the entire irrigation area can be freed from the threat of salinization, and the entire Ningxia Plain will form a complete irrigation and drainage system with crisscrossing canals that benefits both irrigation and drainage.

Currently, a mass movement for comprehensively and thoroughly eradicating saline-alkali soil is vigorously developing on the Ningxia Plain. Party and government organs from the Autonomous Region down to the county and people's commune levels have all listed this work as their current central task. The Autonomous Region has established an Engineering Committee, and counties and communes have also established engineering headquarters. The broad masses of Hui and Han people are first vigorously transforming the saline-alkali land on the west bank of the Yellow River. In less than two months, they have built a 90-kilometer-long West Main Canal of the Qingtongxia Gorge, and newly dug 643 large and small drainage ditches, repaired a total of 880 drainage ditches, and completed the conversion of 400,000 mu of land into small-plot garden fields. Throughout the entire irrigation area, counties and communes are cooperating with each other, providing mutual support, and ensuring the rapid progress of the project.

The Ningxia Yellow River irrigation area is an ancient irrigation area. However, due to long-term disrepair of the canals and lack of drainage facilities before liberation, soil salinization became increasingly serious, forming a large area of salinized land. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, great achievements have been made in the prevention and treatment of salinization. The entire region has built and repaired 47 main and branch drainage canals, and dug and repaired 2,873 branch, channel, and farm ditches, totaling more than 3,900 kilometers in length, draining an area of 2.23 million mu, initially forming an irrigation network. However, there are still many saline-alkali lands and lakes in the entire irrigation area that have not been transformed, and many fields in the existing cultivated land are still threatened by salinization, preventing rapid increases in yield.

The three-year plan for eradicating saline-alkali land formulated by the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has ushered in a new stage in the work of transforming soil salinization, that is, from partial, small-area treatment to comprehensive treatment. In recent years, people's communes in the irrigation area have accumulated rich experience in transforming salinized soil. They have systematically summarized these experiences and proposed that, on the one hand, we should vigorously promote the network of ditches, realizing the successive communication of main, branch, channel, and farm ditches to achieve both irrigation and drainage, eliminating surface water and lowering groundwater; on the other hand, we should implement small-plot garden fields. In this spring, the entire irrigation area will renovate and dredge eleven main drainage ditches, thirteen branch drainage ditches, four new main drainage ditches, two branch ditches, and seven hundred and thirty-eight branch and feeder ditches. At the same time, we will vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work, and build five reservoirs at the main gully mouths along the Helan Mountains. (Attached picture)

### 力争三年内把黄河灌区改造成稻香千里的“塞上江南”  宁夏全面根治盐渍地

    力争三年内把黄河灌区改造成稻香千里的“塞上江南”
    宁夏全面根治盐渍地
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区黄河灌区的宁夏平原百万回、汉族人民，开始全面彻底根治土壤盐渍化，在“以防为主、防治并重、以水为纲、综合治理”方针下，全面规划，力争在三年内，基本防止和根治土地盐渍化，把这个灌区变成为稻香千里的“塞上江南”。
    防止和彻底根治土壤盐渍化，是贯彻农业“八字宪法”，使农业生产稳定增产的关键之一。中共宁夏回族自治区委员会根据当前农业生产发展的新形势，在过去改良盐碱地获得巨大成绩的基础上，提出全面根治土壤盐渍化的三年规划。规划实现后，全灌区现有的三百二十多万亩耕地可以摆脱盐渍化的威胁，整个宁夏平原将形成一个渠道纵横排灌两利完整的排灌系统。
    目前，全面、彻底根治盐渍化土壤的群众运动，正在宁夏平原蓬勃发展。从自治区到县到人民公社的党政机关，都把这一工作列为当前的中心工作。自治区成立了工程委员会，各县、公社也都成立工程指挥部。广大的回、汉族人民首先大力改造黄河西岸的盐渍地，不到两个月时间，就修成了一条长达九十多公里的青铜峡西干渠，还新挖了大小排水沟六百四十三条，共修排水沟八百八十条，完成了小畦园田化四十万亩。在整个灌区内，县与县、公社与公社之间开展协作，互相支援，保证工程迅速进展。
    宁夏黄河灌区是个古老的灌区。但是由于解放前渠道长期失修，没有排水设备，土壤盐渍化日益严重，形成一个大面积的盐渍化地区。解放以后，在党的领导下，防治盐渍化的工作取得了巨大的成就。全区兴修排水干沟和支干沟四十七条，挖修支、斗、农沟二千八百七十三条，共长达三千九百多公里，排水面积达二百二十三万亩，初步形成了灌溉网。但是全灌区还存在着许多盐碱地和湖泊没有得到改造，现有的耕地中还有不少田地受着盐渍化的威胁，产量不能迅速提高。
    中共宁夏回族自治区制定的根治盐碱地的三年规划，使改造土壤盐渍化的工作进入了一个新阶段，即从局部的、小面积的治理发展到全面的治理。灌区内各个人民公社几年来在改造盐渍化土壤方面，已经积累了丰富的经验，他们系统地总结了这些经验，提出一方面要大搞沟网化，实现干、支、斗、农沟依次沟通，达到排灌两利，排除地面水和降低地下水；另一方面要实行大系小畦园田化。全灌区在今年春季就要整修和疏浚的排水干沟十一条，支干沟十三条，新的排水干沟四条，支沟两条，支毛沟七百三十八条。同时，大力开展水土保持工作，沿贺兰山主要沟口修建五座蓄水库。（附图片）
