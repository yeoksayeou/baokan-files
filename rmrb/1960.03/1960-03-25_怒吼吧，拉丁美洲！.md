Roar, Latin America!
Bin Fu

The powerful storm of maintaining independence and striving for democracy has broken open the door of Latin America, awakening and inspiring the insulted and injured people of all countries. The roar of "No intervention in Cuba!" "Any intervention in Cuba is an aggression against the entire Latin America!" resounds through the sky. The protests and demonstrations of the people of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay against Eisenhower's "visit," the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of countries such as Dominica and Paraguay, the patriotic struggles of the people of Panama to reclaim lost territories, the struggles of the people of Puerto Rico to gain independence, and the struggles of the people of other countries to safeguard national interests and strive for democracy are converging like hundreds of rivers flowing into the sea, forming a torrent against American colonialism. The people of Latin America have risen up! The black hand of the American imperialist robbers can no longer stop the magnificent dawn rising on the horizon of this continent! The prophecy of the revolutionary and poet José Martí is being confirmed:

	My dream has become reality... My people,
	Beloved Cuban people, we have raised our chests high,...
	From the Escambray Mountains to the vast Cauto River,
	Storms rage everywhere, our cannons thunder like lightning,
	The ferocious robbers are suddenly frightened out of their wits...

That's right, as long as the Cuban people, the Latin American people, raise their chests high, it is indeed like a bolt from the blue for American imperialism. Facts prove: how frightened and out of their wits the American imperialist robber now appears. The tremendous impact of the Cuban revolution has frightened American imperialism. It fears that other countries in Latin America will follow Cuba's path. Therefore, on the one hand, it uses both threats and inducements to try to establish a "quarantine line" between various Latin American countries and Cuba; on the other hand, it plots arson and explosions, barbarously bombs Cuban sugarcane fields one after another, and supports Cuban traitor Batista elements, etc., and actively prepares for armed intervention, trying every means to re-enact the Guatemalan incident in Cuba and strangle the Cuban revolution. Eisenhower, who had just acted as a "kind grandmother," made a "peaceful" and "friendly" visit to four South American countries. The United States is again flexing its muscles in the Caribbean region, holding large-scale military exercises. This self-defeating action of American imperialism only educates the people of Cuba and Latin America more profoundly from the opposite side. This also shows that under the surging anti-American anger of the Latin American people, the American robbers, frightened out of their wits, are already in a state of great confusion, and thus "randomly throwing drugs."

Aggression is the nature of imperialism. Imperialism will certainly not give up aggression automatically. After Eisenhower's visit to the four South American countries, he hurried back to his country and stepped up preparations for intervention in Cuba. The US Embassy in Havana is demarcating areas in order to evacuate American citizens in large numbers if necessary, and hinting that all Americans who do not need to stay in Cuba at present should leave Cuba. American newspapers are clamoring to overthrow the Cuban government. Eisenhower said: "Our southern neighbors are important to us economically, politically, culturally, and militarily. Indeed, no region in the world is more important to our future than this region." Therefore, "our goal must be to establish a stronger partnership."

Sima Zhao's intention is obvious. The "special relationship" and "partnership" between the United States and Latin America emphasized by Eisenhower are essentially nothing more than the relationship between the aggressor and the aggressed. The Argentine newspaper "New Century" made it clear: "American imperialists regard Latin America as their private territory, a convenient place for their investment, a source of raw materials and cheap labor, and a rear area from which they can freely extract food, colonial slaves, and cannon fodder."

However, Latin America today is no longer the Latin America of more than a hundred years ago. The era of the "Monroe Doctrine," in which the United States could do whatever it wanted, is long gone. Cuban Prime Minister Castro said it well: The enemy's crimes cannot frustrate the heroic and unyielding spirit of the Cuban people; on the contrary, they make the revolution more firm.

Now is the historical era in which imperialism drives the masses of people all over the world onto the great struggle to eliminate imperialism. We, the Chinese people, deeply understand from our own experience that the seemingly powerful imperialism and all reactionaries are nothing but paper tigers. As long as the people who fight for freedom and peace heighten their vigilance, unite as one, abandon illusions, and resolutely fight, imperialism can be completely defeated.

Today, in the situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, with the support of the powerful socialist forces, the national liberation movement has become an irresistible trend. The international situation is more favorable to the national democratic movement and unfavorable to imperialism than it was eleven years ago when the Chinese revolution won victory. The Chinese people stand completely on the side of the Cuban and Latin American people; the peace-loving people of the world also stand completely on the side of the Cuban and Latin American people. No matter how American imperialism carries out its vicious threats and interventions, final victory will surely belong to the people of Cuba and Latin America.

Roar, Latin America! The life of imperialism will not be long.

    怒吼吧，拉丁美洲！
    宾符
    强大的维护独立、争取民主的风暴冲开了拉丁美洲的大门，唤醒和鼓舞了被侮辱与被损害的各国人民。“不许干涉古巴！”“对古巴的任何干涉，就是对整个拉丁美洲的侵略！”的怒吼响彻云霄。巴西、阿根廷、智利和乌拉圭人民对艾森豪威尔“访问”的抗议、示威，多米尼加、巴拉圭等国人民的反独裁斗争，巴拿马人民要求收回失地的爱国斗争，波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争，以及其他国家人民维护民族利益和争取民主的斗争，像百川归海似地正在汇成反对美国殖民主义的洪流。拉丁美洲人民起来了！美帝国主义强盗的黑手，再也拦不住这个大陆地平线上冉冉升起的瑰丽的黎明！革命家和诗人何塞·马蒂的预言正在被证实：
    我的梦想变成了现实……我国的人民啊，
    可爱的古巴人民，我们已把胸膛挺起，……
    从艾斯康勃里山峦到茫茫的卡乌托江，
    到处风雨狂作，我们的炮声如同霹雳，
    凶恶的强盗突然吓得丢魂丧魄……
    一点也不错，只要古巴人民，拉丁美洲人民把胸膛一挺起，对于美帝国主义的确无异是晴天霹雳。事实证明：美帝国主义这个凶恶的强盗，现在显得多么丢魂丧魄。古巴革命胜利的巨大影响吓坏了美帝国主义。它害怕拉丁美洲其他国家走古巴的道路。因之，它一方面又是威吓、又是骗诱地想在拉丁美洲各国和古巴之间建立一道“防疫线”；一方面又策划军火爆炸事件，接连野蛮地轰炸古巴蔗田，豢养古巴卖国贼巴蒂斯塔分子等，并积极准备武装干涉，千方百计地妄图在古巴重演危地马拉事件，扼杀古巴革命。艾森豪威尔刚扮作了“慈祥的外婆”，对南美四国进行了“和平”“亲善”的访问，美国又在加勒比海地区耀武扬威，举行大规模的军事演习。美帝国主义这种自己揭穿自己的行动，只有更深刻地从反面教育了古巴和拉丁美洲的人民。这也说明了在拉丁美洲人民澎湃奔腾的反美怒潮下，吓得丢魂丧魄的美国强盗已经是方寸大乱，以致“杂药乱投”了。
    侵略是帝国主义的本性。帝国主义当然不会自动放弃侵略的。艾森豪威尔自访问南美四国，抱头鼠窜回国后，就加紧准备对古巴的干涉。美国驻哈瓦那大使馆正在划定地区，以便必要时大批撤退美国公民，并暗示所有目前没有必要留在古巴的美国人离开古巴。美国报刊大肆鼓噪，要推翻古巴政府。艾森豪威尔说：“我们的南部邻国从经济、政治、文化和军事上来说，对我们是重要的。的确，对我们前途来说，世界上再没有哪个地区比这个地区更为重要的了。”因此，“我们的目标必须是建立更巩固的伙伴关系。”
    司马昭之心，昭然若揭。艾森豪威尔强调的美国和拉丁美洲的“特殊关系”“伙伴关系”，实质上无非是侵略者对被侵略者的关系。阿根廷“新世纪”报说得明白：“美国帝国主义分子把拉丁美洲看成他们的私人领地，他们投资的适意地方，原料和廉价劳动力的来源以及他们可以随意从那里提取粮食、殖民地奴隶和炮灰的后方。”
    然而今天的拉丁美洲已经不是一百多年前的拉丁美洲了。美国可以为所欲为的“门罗主义”时代早已一去不复返了。古巴总理卡斯特罗说得好：敌人罪行不能挫折古巴人民英勇不屈的精神，恰恰相反，使革命更加坚定了。
    现在，是帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。我们中国人民从自己的经验中深切懂得，貌似强大的帝国主义和一切反动派不过是纸老虎。争自由与和平的人民只要提高警惕，团结一致，丢掉幻想，坚决斗争，帝国主义是完全可以打败的。
    今天，在东风继续压倒西风的形势下，在强大的社会主义力量的支持之下，民族解放运动已经成为不可抗拒的潮流。国际形势较之十一年前中国革命胜利的时候，是更加有利于民族民主运动而不利于帝国主义了。中国人民完全站在古巴和拉丁美洲人民这一边；全世界爱好和平的人民也完全站在古巴和拉丁美洲人民这一边。不管美帝国主义怎样进行穷凶极恶的威胁和干涉，最后胜利一定属于古巴和拉丁美洲的人民。
    怒吼吧，拉丁美洲！帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。
