　　Carrying water, chopping vegetables, and cooking,
　　For years, it has been this way.
　　Since the public canteen was born,
　　The reform of kitchen utensils has brought great changes:
　　Once the machine is started, the vegetables are chopped,
　　Clean water is led to the stove,
　　While cooking, we study,
　　The food is cooked, the dishes are fragrant, and people are happy.
　　The reform of kitchen utensils is of great benefit,
　　Cooking is all mechanized,
　　Saving manpower for production,
　　Increased production is even more than last year.
　　The powered mill has many advantages,
　　One person can do the work of nine,
　　In the past, ten people pushed the mill,
　　Now one person still feels it is too much.
　　The small motor is fierce,
　　Driving five mills running like the wind,
　　It can grind a thousand catties of flour a day,
　　Creation and invention show miraculous results.

    炊具改革见奇功
    挑水切菜做饭忙，
    多少年来是这样。
    公共食堂诞生后，
    炊具革新大变样：
    机器一动菜切好，
    清水引到锅灶旁，
    边做饭来边学习，
    饭熟菜香人欢畅。
    炊具改革好处大，
    做饭都用机械化，
    节省人力搞生产，
    增产更比去年多。
    动力磨，好处多，
    一人能干九人活，
    从前推磨人十个，
    如今一人还嫌多。
    小小马达凶又凶，
    带动五磨跑如风，
    一日能磨千斤面，
    创造发明见奇功。
