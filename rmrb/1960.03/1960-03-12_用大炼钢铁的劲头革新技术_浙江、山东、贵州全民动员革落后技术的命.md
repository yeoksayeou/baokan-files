Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch, Reporter Ren Zhaoying, Yi Xintian report:  A technical innovation and technical revolution storm is sweeping through every corner of Zhejiang Province's urban and rural areas, rapidly forming into a mass movement, changing the face of production technology and daily life in all aspects.

Throughout the province, the number of workers in factories and mines above the county level using mechanized or semi-mechanized operations has rapidly increased from about 30% of the total number of workers to over 50%. In the province's iron, wood, and bamboo industries, grain processing industry, tea making, brewing, oil extraction, sewing, and other industries, mechanized and semi-mechanized machinery have basically become complete sets.  Some enterprises with higher levels of mechanization are moving towards automation and semi-automation.  Over two thousand machine tools in the province's machinery industry have achieved automation and semi-automation.  Hangzhou City has also established over sixty automatic production lines and linked lines.  The labor productivity of industry and agriculture has risen sharply, promoting an overall surge in production.  The province's completion of industrial product quality and cost targets has greatly improved, and the total industrial output value in January and February significantly increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  Many units have achieved "ideological redness, innovation redness, and production redness."

On the agricultural front, a technical transformation movement centered on the reform of spring plowing tools is forming a surge.  Over a thousand new types of tools have appeared in cultivation, rice transplanting, tea making, silkworm raising, and other fields, and are being promoted in complete sets according to work types.  Over thirteen thousand rural canteens in the province have achieved semi-mechanization of cooking equipment, and over thirty thousand pig farms have achieved mechanization of feed cutting, carting of feed, or automated water supply.

In urban and rural stores, new tools and technologies such as measuring cloth without rulers, cutting cloth without scissors, rolling cloth without hands, and pricing without abacuses are appearing everywhere.

With the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, Party organizations at all levels throughout the province have strengthened their leadership, ensuring that the movement is carried out with leadership, organization, planning, and goals, regardless of whether it is in urban areas, rural areas, or all walks of life.  Cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Jiaxing, and many county towns, have Party committee secretaries taking command, establishing command headquarters by industry, fighting along different lines, first concentrating efforts to break through key points, and rapidly promoting them throughout the industry through on-site meetings, exhibitions, promotion groups, and visits.  The experience of Desheng Dam Wharf in Hangzhou City in integrating machinery into complete sets has been widely promoted, promoting the rapid realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading at eighteen wharves throughout the province with an annual throughput of over 100,000 tons.  Comprehensive planning, segmented assaults, is a prominent experience of Party committees at all levels in leading the movement.  Most counties, factories, workshops, and groups throughout the province have formulated plans at each level, with clear centers and concentrated goals, achieving breakthroughs in key areas and blossoming in all directions, ensuring the rapid development of the movement.  A total of more than 160,000 technical innovations have been achieved in various industries throughout the province.  On the agricultural front, the province has established an Agricultural Technical Transformation Committee, formulated a comprehensive plan, and proposed the center and measures for each stage.  Each special zone, county, and people's commune is also establishing organizations and formulating plans.  Many leading cadres personally go to the front line of production to lead the masses in vigorously reforming spring plowing tools.

Socialist labor competitions and large-scale collaboration have played a huge role in promoting the widespread and in-depth development of the technical innovation movement. The competition in many regions has new developments, and there are forms such as mass battles, large-scale military exercises, large-scale performances, large-scale collaboration, red and expert shock teams, and "three-way combination technical innovation teams." Many regions not only compete and collaborate with each other within the industry, but also develop a three-way combination of production units, scientific research institutions, and schools to jointly overcome key production issues. Zhejiang University teachers and students cooperated with workers from Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Factory to create an electrical program controlled automatic machine tool; Jiaxing Science and Technology Association cooperated with Jiaxing Metallurgical Factory to create a super calender.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, Reporter Yu Chaoqing reports: Shandong's industrial front, with mechanization and semi-mechanization as the center, is experiencing a massive, magnificent, and effective technical innovation and technical revolution movement. From large and medium-sized factories and mines to county and commune industries, from production departments to living service departments, from scientific research departments to universities and colleges, from industry, transportation to basic construction sites, moving innovation stories are constantly emerging. From January to mid-February, preliminary statistics show that the staff and workers of the province's industry, transportation, basic construction and other systems have put forward more than 440,000 innovation proposals, and more than 168,000 have been realized. By mid-February, Jinan and Qingdao had realized more than 60 automated, semi-automated production lines and mechanized production linkage lines. In various regions and industries, many manual operations and heavy physical labor have been mechanized and semi-mechanized. Labor efficiency has increased many times or even hundreds of times, effectively promoting the sustained leap forward in production.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that leading departments at all levels should not only consider current needs, but also consider the comprehensive technical transformation of enterprises or industries. All regions and industries in the province and their affiliated factories and mining enterprises have formulated technical innovation plans that combine the near term with the long term, and combine individual innovations with enterprise transformation, adopting the principle of self-reliance and walking on two legs, so that the movement can develop forward with leadership, planning, and organization, and quickly form a climax.

At present, technical innovation and technical revolution have become a conscious and urgent requirement of the broad masses of workers and staff in Shandong Province. Therefore, the scale of the movement is expanding day by day, and a magnificent scene of everyone innovating, everywhere innovating, and innovating every day is appearing everywhere. For example, the staff and workers of Linqing Transportation Machinery Factory launched a "treasure offering" movement centered on the key to production, creating more than 100 kinds of indigenous machines in less than 10 days, making the main processes and heavy labor mechanized, and labor efficiency increased by one to four hundred times. All the staff and workers of Luokou Port of the Yellow River Shipping Bureau "started innovating with their own hands and built machines through self-reliance." At present, the loading and unloading operations of the entire port have basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization, and the loading and unloading efficiency has increased by nearly two times. The staff and workers of the steelmaking workshop of Qingdao Bicycle Factory vigorously promoted the style of communist collaboration. Under the leadership of the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau, and with the strong help of schools and scientific research departments, they made seven kinds of alloy steel from 0.5-ton small converters, opening up broad avenues for the production of small converters.

In such a large-scale mass movement, many advanced experiences have been rapidly promoted from point to area. For example, Zibo Porcelain Factory created the advanced experience of gas-fired kilns, opening the way for the widespread use of gas in various industries. Under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, by the beginning of February, more than 6,800 simple gas generators had been built in the province. The result of the comprehensive promotion of this experience in all light industry, metallurgy, machinery, chemical industry, textile and other industrial systems is that coal is generally saved by 40% to 60%. At present, the scope of gas utilization is becoming wider and wider. Not only production units use it, but also many public canteens, restaurants and heating use gas.

Technical innovation and technical revolution have also promoted the leap forward of enterprise management departments. After launching a climax of technical performance competitions with daily performances and class performances, Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant also launched performance competitions in design, material supply, planning and scheduling, economic accounting, etc., under the organization of the factory Party committee, to promote the reform of office work and adapt to the requirements of production. For example, after launching a "fast, high-quality" design performance competition, the design department of this factory completed the design task of a forging workshop in 24 hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 11th Dispatch, Reporter Wang Qinghai reports:  The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on Guizhou Province's industrial front, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, is magnificent. Since the beginning of this year, more than 140,000 innovation proposals have been realized on the province's industrial front.  Factories and mines with a higher degree of mechanization are advancing towards automation and semi-automation; enterprises with a low degree of mechanization are vigorously engaging in mechanization and semi-mechanization; small factories that are mainly based on manual operation are replacing manual labor with various indigenous and foreign machines.  Large cities such as Guiyang, Zunyi, and Duyun have launched a surge of vigorously engaging in linkage and automation.  According to incomplete statistics, twelve production lines have been built throughout the province, and one factory and twenty-five workshops (work sections or processes) have achieved linked production.  Fifty-seven factories and one hundred and forty-nine workshops or work sections in Guiyang City and Bijie Special Zone have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.  In departments with more manual labor such as loading and unloading, infrastructure construction, crushing, and forging, thousands of workers have discarded axes, hammers, carrying poles, and baskets, and have begun using indigenous and foreign machinery.  The mixing, pouring, and hoisting of materials at more than twenty large-scale construction sites throughout the province have all achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.

Moving from general and individual innovations to comprehensive technical transformation by industry is the main trend of the current movement's development. Under the influence of Guiyang Wood Factory taking the lead in realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized production, the woodworking industry in Guiyang City vigorously built indigenous and foreign machinery to equip itself, and successively manufactured and promoted indigenous machinery such as mortising machines, seam clearing machines, planing machines, and toothing machines, enabling more than 85% of the processes to be transformed from manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized production.  From then on, the broad masses of workers put down ancient tools such as axes, planes, and chisels that had been used for thousands of years, and bid farewell to heavy physical labor.

Many industries adhered to the spirit of continuous revolution during innovation, and boldly made improvements in the promotion of existing experience. When promoting the intra-factory transportation experience of Wengan Xinhua Iron Factory, factories and mines in Guiyang area put forward the slogan of "railway transportation for solid materials, pipeline transportation for liquid materials," enriching and improving Xinhua Iron Factory's experience. At present, 148 kilometers of intra-factory transportation railways and 930 meters of pipelines have been built in the city.

Strengthening Party leadership is the key to the smooth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.  Leadership organizations for technical innovation and technical revolution have been established at the provincial, special (autonomous prefecture), county, and larger enterprise levels.  The secretary takes command, the entire Party mobilizes, all the people take action, leaders talk about the situation, point out the direction, assign tasks, and propose topics, and fully mobilize the masses, adhere to the system of two participations, one reform, and three combinations, ensuring that the mass movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth.

    用大炼钢铁的劲头革新技术
    浙江、山东、贵州全民动员革落后技术的命
    浙江
    据新华社杭州电　记者任兆英、伊心恬报道：技术革新和技术革命风暴，横扫着浙江省城乡各个角落，迅速形成为全民性的运动，改变着各方面的生产技术和日常生活的面貌。
    全省县以上厂矿采用机械化半机械化操作的工人，已经由原来的占工人总数30％左右迅速上升到50％以上。全省铁木竹行业，粮食加工业，制茶、酿酒、榨油、缝纫等行业，机械化和半机械化机具已基本上成套成列。有些机械化水平较高的企业，正朝着自动化、半自动化的方向迈进。全省机械工业已有两千多台机床实现自动化、半自动化。杭州市还建立了六十多条自动生产线和联动线。工农业劳动生产率急剧上升，促进了生产全面高涨。全省工业产品质量、成本等方面完成计划情况都有很大的进步，1、2月份的工业总产值比去年第四季度显著增长。很多单位做到了“思想红、革新红、生产红”。
    在农业战线上，以春耕工具改革为中心的技术改造运动正在形成热潮。耕作、插秧、制茶、养蚕等方面，已经出现了一千多种新式工具，正在按工种配套成龙，成套地推广。全省有一万三千多个农村食堂实现了炊具半机械化，三万多个养猪场做到了切料机械化、运料车子化或者用水自来化。
    城乡的商店里，也到处出现量布不用尺，裁布不用剪，卷布不用手，计价不用算盘的新工具、新技术。
    随着技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展，全省各级党组织都加强了领导，不论城市、农村和各行各业，都做到有领导、有组织、有规划、有目标地进行。杭州、宁波、嘉兴等城市和许多县城都由党委书记挂帅，按行业成立指挥部，分线作战，首先集中力量突破重点，通过现场会、展览会、促进团、参观访问，在全行业迅速推广。杭州市德胜坝码头机具配套成龙的经验广泛推广后，促进全省十八个年吞吐量在十万吨以上的码头迅速地实现了装卸机械化半机械化。全面规划，分段突击，是各级党委领导运动的突出经验。全省大多数县、厂、车间、小组，都层层订出规划，中心明确，目标集中，做到重点突破，四面开花，保证运动迅猛发展。全省各行业已经实现的技术革新共达十六万多件。在农业战线上，省成立了农业技术改造委员会，订出全面规划，提出每个阶段的中心和措施。各专区、县、人民公社也正在成立组织，制订规划。许多领导干部亲临生产第一线，领导群众大搞春耕工具改革。
    社会主义劳动竞赛和大协作，对推动技术革新运动广泛深入发展起了极大的作用。许多地区的竞赛有了新的发展，出现了大会战、大练武、大表演、大协作、红专突击队和“三结合技术革新队”等形式。许多地区不仅在工业内部相互竞赛，相互协作，而且发展到生产单位和科学研究机关、学校三结合，共同攻破生产关键。浙江大学师生和杭州制氧机厂工人协作，创造了电气程序控制自动机床；嘉兴科学技术协会和嘉兴矿冶厂协作，制成了超级压光机。
    山东
    据新华社济南电　记者于朝卿报道：山东工业战线以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，声势浩大，规模壮阔，效果显著。从大、中型厂矿到县社工业，从生产部门到生活服务部门，从科学研究部门到大专院校，从工业、交通运输到基本建设工地，都不断地涌现出动人的革新事迹。从1月到2月中旬的初步统计，全省工业、交通运输、基本建设等系统的职工群众共提出了革新建议四十四万多条，已经实现十六万八千多条。济南、青岛两市到2月中旬止，已经实现自动化、半自动化生产流水线和机械化生产联动线六十多条。各地区各行业，许多手工操作和笨重体力劳动实现了机械化和半机械化。劳动效率成倍甚至成百倍地提高，有力地推动了生产的持续跃进。
    中共山东省委强调要求各级领导部门，不仅要从当前需要去考虑，而且必须考虑对企业或行业的全面技术改造。全省各地区各行业和所属的厂矿企业，都制定了近期同远期结合，单项革新同企业改造相结合的技术革新规划，采取自力更生、两条腿走路的方针，从而使运动有领导、有计划、有组织地向前发展，并且很快地形成高潮。
    目前，技术革新和技术革命，已经成为山东省广大职工群众的一种自觉的迫切要求。因此，运动规模日益扩大，到处出现人人革新、处处革新、天天革新的壮丽景象。如临清市运输机械厂的职工，围绕着生产关键开展人人“献宝”运动，不到十天就创造了各种土机械一百多种，使主要工序和笨重的劳动实现了机械化，劳动效率提高一倍到四百多倍。黄河航运局洛口港全体职工“人人动手闹革新，自力更生造机器”，到目前全港装卸作业基本实现了机械化半机械化，装卸效率提高近两倍。青岛自行车厂炼钢车间的职工大兴共产主义协作之风，在市冶金局的领导下，得到学校和科学研究部门的大力帮助，使零点五吨小转炉炼出七种合金钢，为小转炉的生产开辟了广阔的道路。
    在这样大规模的群众运动中，不少先进经验都由点到面地迅速得到推广。例如淄博瓷厂创造了煤气烧窑的先进经验，为各行业广泛利用煤气打开了道路。在中共山东省委的领导下，到2月上旬为止，全省已建成简易煤气发生炉六千八百多座。这一经验，在所有轻工、冶金、机械、化工、纺织等工业系统中全面推广的结果，一般节约煤炭40％到60％。目前，煤气的利用范围越来越广，不仅生产单位使用，而且许多公共食堂、饭店和取暖都使用了煤气。
    技术革新和技术革命也推动了企业管理部门的跃进。青岛四方机车车辆厂在掀起日日表演、班班表演的技术表演赛高潮之后，设计、材料供应、计划调度、经济核算等方面，也在工厂党委的组织下，大搞表演赛，推动科室工作的改革，适应了生产的要求。例如这个厂的设计科在开展“快速、优质”的设计表演赛之后，用二十四小时就完成了一座锻工车间的设计任务。
    贵州
    据新华社贵阳11日电　记者王青海报道：贵州省工业战线以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新与技术革命运动波澜壮阔。今年以来，全省工业战线共实现革新建议十四万多件。机械化程度较高的厂矿正在向自动化、半自动化进军；机械化程度不高的企业在大搞机械化和半机械化；以手工操作为主的小厂，正在用各种土洋机械代替手工劳动。贵阳、遵义、都匀等市的大企业，已经掀起了大搞联动化、自动化的热潮。据不完全统计，全省已建成十二条生产作业线，有一个工厂、二十五个车间（工段或工序）实现了联动化生产。贵阳市和毕节专区有五十七个工厂、一百四十九个车间或工段，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。在装卸、基建、破碎、铸锻等手工劳动较多的部门，成千上万的工人甩掉了斧子、鎯头、扁担和箩筐，用上了土洋机械。全省二十几个大型建筑工地的搅拌、浇铸和吊运材料等工序，都实现了机械化半机械化。
    由一般的、个别的革新，走向按行业全面的技术改造，是当前运动发展的主要趋势。贵阳市木工行业在贵阳木工厂率先实现机械化半机械化生产的影响下，大造土洋机械装备自己，先后制成并推广了刨榫机、清缝机、刨木机、开齿机等土机械，使85％以上的工序由手工操作变成机械化半机械化生产。从此，广大工人放下了使用几千年的斧、刨、凿等古老工具，与繁重的体力劳动告别。
    许多行业在革新中坚持不断革命的精神，在推广已有的经验中，又大胆地进行了改进。贵阳地区各厂矿在推广瓮安新华铁厂厂内运输经验时，提出了“固体物资运输轨道化，液体物资运输管道化”的口号，丰富并提高了新华铁厂的经验。目前全市已建成厂内运输轨道一百四十八公里，管道九百三十米。
    加强党的领导，是技术革新和技术革命运动顺利开展的关键。省、专（州）、县，以及较大的企业，都建立了技术革新和技术革命的领导机构。书记挂帅，全党动员、全民动手，领导讲形势、指方向、交任务、出课题，并且充分发动群众，坚持两参一改三结合的制度，保证了群众运动既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实。（附图片）
