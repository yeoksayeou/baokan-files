Xinhua News Agency, March 17th:

    The national mechanical industry system is extensively formulating technical innovation and technical revolution plans centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, clarifying directions and goals, and promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to develop more deeply and extensively.
    The mechanical industry provides technical equipment for various sectors of the national economy. According to this characteristic, the technological revolution in the mechanical industry should be ahead of the technological transformation of the entire national economy. To this end, the preliminary plan formulated by the First Ministry of Machine Building requires, on the one hand, a general increase in the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization, actively and gradually moving towards semi-automation and automation; on the other hand, it requires the rapid development of high-efficiency, large-scale, precision, cutting-edge, and novel products, the widespread use of new materials, the mastery of cutting-edge technologies, and the ascent to the peaks of world science and technology. The plan addresses the current production key and the tasks undertaken by the mechanical industry in the national economy, requiring all regions and enterprises to firmly grasp the following key links. First, concentrate superior forces to launch a mass movement for the mechanization and semi-mechanization of "casting, forging, welding, and transportation," requiring the elimination of a large amount of heavy manual labor in these four weak links by the first half of this year, so that the production of these links is basically mechanized and semi-mechanized. Second, in the entire mechanical industry system, universally promote the experience created by Beijing, Harbin, and other places in carrying out the "ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand" mass movement (i.e., extensively mobilizing the masses to establish ten automated and semi-automated workshops and factories, hundreds of automatic production lines, thousands of single-machine automation and semi-automation devices, and tens of thousands of mechanized manual operations). Each enterprise and region should propose struggle goals based on specific circumstances and actively improve the level of mechanization and automation. Third, vigorously develop new products and new materials, and rapidly move towards "high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and novel"; improve product structure, save materials, labor, and improve efficiency. Fourth, actively promote many high-efficiency, new-structure products that have already been successfully trial-produced, such as modular machine tools, electro-pulse processing machine tools, hammer without drill base, multi-rope hoists, etc. Actively promote many effective new processes, such as high-sulfur nodular cast iron, clay mold casting, electroslag welding, etc. In these areas, each region is required to propose specific promotion targets, formulate specific measures, establish the promotion work on a solid and reliable foundation, and persevere. In addition, the plan also puts forward clear requirements for strengthening scientific research, improving production organization and management systems, and organizing and promoting cultural revolution.
    Various types of work, enterprises, and regions are now formulating specific plans for technical innovation and technical revolution according to the development of the movement and the overall requirements of the mechanical industry. Many types of work, enterprises, and regions have further clarified the development direction of this type of work, enterprise, and region, and summarized the experience created by the masses since the start of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the process of formulating plans.
    The mechanical industry system has also explored two experiences in formulating technical innovation and technical revolution plans. The first is to plan while acting, with both action and planning, constantly revising and supplementing the plan in the movement, and using the plan to continuously guide the movement forward. The second is to combine on-site meetings to formulate plans. Using this method to formulate plans can not only ensure the advanced nature of the plan, but also make the plan close to reality and easy to implement, while also combining indicators and measures.
    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation in the mechanical industry system has developed rapidly. Since the nationwide on-site conference on mechanization and automation in the mechanical industry was held in Heilongjiang Province at the end of January this year to fully mobilize the masses, in just over a month, the national machinery industry has seen more than 1,300 automatic production lines and automatic assembly lines, and more than 8,300 single-machine automation equipment.

    一机部定出技术革新初步规划
    集中优势力量，大闹“铸、锻、焊、运”机械化半机械化大力发展新产品和新材料，迅速向“高大精尖新”迈进
    据新华社17日讯　全国机械工业系统正在广泛制订以机械化半机械化，自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命规划，明确方向和目标，推动技术革新和技术革命运动更深入更广泛地向前发展。
    机械工业是为国民经济各部门提供技术装备的。根据这一特点，机械工业的技术革命应当走在整个国民经济技术改造的前头。为此，第一机械工业部初步拟订的规划，一方面要求普遍提高机械化半机械化程度，积极地逐步地向半自动化自动化前进；另一方面要迅速发展高效率、大型、精密、尖端和新颖的产品，广泛采用新材料，掌握尖端技术，攀登世界科学技术的高峰。规划针对当前的生产关键和机械工业在国民经济中所承担的任务，要求各地区各企业紧紧抓住以下几个重要环节。第一，集中优势力量，首先开展一个“铸、锻、焊、运”机械化半机械化的群众运动，要求在今年上半年内消除铸造、锻造、焊接和厂内运输等四个薄弱环节中大量的笨重体力劳动，使这些环节的生产基本上实现机械化半机械化。第二，在整个机械工业系统中，普遍推广北京、哈尔滨等地创造的开展“十、百、千、万”群众运动（即广泛发动群众建立成十个自动化半自动化车间和工厂、成百条的自动生产线、成千台的单机自动化半自动化、成万项的手工操作机械化）的经验，各企业各地区要根据具体情况提出奋斗目标，积极提高机械化和自动化水平。第三，大力发展新产品和新材料，迅速向“高大精尖新”迈进；改进产品结构，节约材料、劳力和提高效率。第四，积极推广已经试制成功的许多高效率、新结构产品，例如组合机床、电脉冲加工机床、无钻座锻锤、多绳卷扬机等。积极推广许多行之有效的新工艺，例如高硫土球墨铸铁、泥型铸造、电渣焊等。在这些方面，要求各地区提出具体的推广指标，订出具体措施，把推广工作建立在切实可靠的基础上，并坚持下去。此外，在加强科学研究工作、改进生产组织和管理制度、组织和推动文化革命等方面，规划也都提出了明确的要求。
    各个工种、各个企业、各个地区，现在正在根据运动发展情况和机械工业总的要求，分别制定技术革新和技术革命的具体规划，许多工种、企业和地区，在制定规划过程中，都进一步明确了本工种、本企业、本地区的发展方向，总结了大闹技术革新和技术革命以来群众创造的经验。
    机械工业系统还摸索出了两条制定技术革新和技术革命规划的经验。第一是边行动、边规划，既有行动，又有规划，在运动中不断修正补充规划，又用规划不断指导运动前进。第二是结合现场会议制订规划，用这种办法订规划，既可以保证规划的先进性，又可以使规划接近实际，便于贯彻，同时还能把指标和措施结合起来。
    机械工业系统中的以机械化半机械化，自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动发展得很快，从今年1月底在黑龙江省召开全国机械工业机械化自动化现场会议全面发动群众以来，在短短的一个多月当中，全国机械行业就出现了一千三百多条自动生产线和自动流水线，八千三百多台单机自动化设备。
