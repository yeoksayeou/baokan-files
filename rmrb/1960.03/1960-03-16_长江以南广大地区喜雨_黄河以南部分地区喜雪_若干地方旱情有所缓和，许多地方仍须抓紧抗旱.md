Xinhua News Agency, March 15th. Recently, parts of the area south of the Yellow River have experienced snowfall, and a considerable area south of the Yangtze River has experienced rainfall. Many areas that have long felt drought have also received rain and snow. In areas with heavier rain and snow, the drought situation will be somewhat alleviated. However, many areas without rain or snow, and areas where the rain and snow are not significant enough due to prolonged drought, still need to continue to intensify drought resistance.

This rain and snow was caused by a strong cold air mass moving south from Siberia. From the 11th to the 14th, snow fell in areas south of the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the Huai River basin, and north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Among them, the snowfall in southwestern Shanxi, central Shaanxi, most of Henan, and northern Hubei had precipitation between 10 and 20 millimeters. Along the Yangtze River in central Hubei, central Anhui, and both banks of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu, rain or snow fell, with precipitation generally between 20 and 30 millimeters.

At the same time, a considerable area south of the Yangtze River experienced rainfall. Among them, southern Hubei, northern Hunan, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, central and eastern Sichuan, and southern Yunnan had rainfall of 10 to 20 millimeters; eastern Guizhou, west and south of Chengdu in Sichuan, and central Yunnan had rainfall of 5 to 10 millimeters; central Guangdong and the eastern coastal areas had rainfall of 20 to 40 millimeters; most of Guangxi, inland Guangdong, and the western coastal areas had rainfall of 50 to 80 millimeters. Currently, the rain is still continuing in various parts of South China.

With this rainfall in the south, the drought situation is expected to be greatly alleviated in some areas of Guangdong and Fujian with larger amounts of rainfall. The rain-receiving areas are stepping up water storage, rushing to plant and prepare for transplanting early rice. The snow-receiving areas in the north are also stepping up soil moisture conservation and preparing for sowing.

Most of the snow-receiving areas in the north and some of the rain-receiving areas in the south still feel that the amount of rain and snow is small due to the prolonged drought, and it is still necessary to continue drought resistance. Gansu, Hebei, Shanxi, most of Shandong, and northern Shaanxi, which have been dry for a long time, did not experience snowfall this time, and the spring drought is still continuing, and the struggle against drought continues to surge. Relevant departments pointed out that since last winter and this spring, there has been less rain and snow in most parts of our country. Many areas where drought has occurred this year have developed on the basis of last year's drought, and the soil moisture content is very low. Although there has been some rain and snow, it is not enough to solve the problem for most areas, especially since most areas north of the Yellow River have not experienced snowfall. Therefore, these areas must continue to strengthen their leadership in drought prevention and resistance work, and do everything possible to prevent and resist to the end. Areas that have received a certain amount of rain and snow should vigorously promote soil moisture conservation, water storage, and water conservation, ensuring that every drop returns to the fields.

### 长江以南广大地区喜雨  黄河以南部分地区喜雪  若干地方旱情有所缓和，许多地方仍须抓紧抗旱

    长江以南广大地区喜雨
    黄河以南部分地区喜雪
    若干地方旱情有所缓和，许多地方仍须抓紧抗旱
    新华社15日讯　最近黄河以南有部分地区下雪，长江以南相当广大的地区下雨。许多久感干旱的地区也获得了雨雪。其中雨雪较大的地方，旱情将有所缓和。但是许多没有雨雪的地区和干旱太久而雨雪不大的地区，仍须继续抓紧抗旱。
    这次雨雪是由于西伯利亚一股强大的冷空气南下造成的。从11日起到14日三天里，黄河中游以南，淮河流域和长江中下游以北各地都下了雪。其中，山西的西南部、陕西中部、河南大部、湖北北部的雪，降水量在十毫米到二十毫米之间。沿长江的湖北中部、安徽中部和江苏的长江两岸，下了雨或雪，降水量一般在二十毫米到三十毫米之间。
    与此同时，长江以南相当广大地区下雨。其中湖北南部、湖南北部、江苏南部、安徽南部，浙江、江西、福建三省，四川中部和东部、云南南部的雨量有十毫米到二十毫米；贵州东部、四川成都以西以南、云南中部降雨有五毫米到十毫米；广东中部、东部沿海雨量二十毫米到四十毫米；广西大部、广东内陆和西部沿海的雨量有五十毫米到八十毫米。现在，华南各地的雨还在继续下。
    这次南方下雨，广东、福建部分雨量较大的地区旱象可望有很大缓和。获雨地区都在加紧蓄水、抢种和准备栽插早稻。北方获雪地区也在加紧耕地保墒，准备播种。
    北方大部分下雪地区和南方部分下雨地区由于久旱，仍感这次雨雪量小，仍须继续抗旱。久旱的甘肃、河北、山西、山东大部、陕西北部这次都没有下雪，春旱仍在持续，抗旱斗争在继续高涨。有关部门指出，去冬今春我国大部地区雨雪较少，今年发生旱象的许多地区，又是在去年受旱的基础上发展起来的，土壤含水率很低，目前虽然下了些雨雪，但对大多数地区来说解决问题是不大的，特别是黄河以北地区大部没有下雪。因此这些地区仍须继续加强对防旱抗旱工作的领导，千方百计防抗到底。已获一定雨雪的地区要大搞保墒、蓄水、保水的工作，做到点滴归田。
