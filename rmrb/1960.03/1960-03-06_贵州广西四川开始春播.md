Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 5th: Spring planting has begun in Guizhou, Guangxi and Sichuan.

In Guizhou Province, from the high and cold mountainous areas in the northwest to the warm and humid areas in the southeast, and across the vast lands from the Chishui River to the Nanpan and Beipan Rivers, people are busy sowing seeds everywhere. As of February 25th, the province had sown 2.05 million mu of spring potatoes, 3.39 million mu of early corn, over 1.4 million mu of miscellaneous grains, and prepared rice seedlings on over 120,000 mu. Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and the Zunyi and Tongren regions, which progressed rapidly, completed or exceeded their spring potato and early corn sowing tasks ahead of schedule and with good quality. According to inspections in Tongren Region, cornfields were generally ploughed to a depth of about eight inches, with more than 5,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu, planting 5,000 to 6,000 plants, and over 80% of the seeds were carefully selected and treated. In Chishui, Wangmo and other counties where the season is earlier, corn and potato seedlings are already two to three inches tall, with two to four true leaves, and are lush and strong.

Following the principle of "taking grain as the key link, promoting all-round development," all localities are actively increasing intercropping and expanding the sown area while planting early and planting well, striving to plant more and harvest more. In Bijie Region, over 70% of the early-sown crop land is intercropped with melons, beans, and oil crops. In Xingyi County, the area of early-sown crops has doubled compared to last year due to the implementation of intercropping. All localities are also planting melons and tuber crops extensively along field edges, corners, "five sides and four edges," and in newly afforested areas from last winter. In Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, intercropping in new forest land has increased the planting of corn by over 170,000 mu and sweet potatoes by over 2,900 mu. Tongren Region has planted over 30 million pumpkin seedlings and 67 million corn seedlings using field edges and other scattered land. Zunyi Region has sown over 160,000 mu of kidney beans alone by utilizing scattered land.

A movement to "fill the frames with melons, cover the mountains with beans, eliminate scattered land, and create vast fields of grain" is currently being carried out in depth across the Guizhou Plateau.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 5th: The spring planting of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is progressing rapidly.

According to statistics as of March 1st, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has sown over 33.7 million mu of various spring-sown dry land crops such as corn, sorghum, and peanuts, which is more than five times the amount sown in the same period last year. The early-sown crops have already germinated and emerged. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of spring-sown crops, all localities are continuing to sow while also strengthening the management of the emerged land in a timely manner.

In Nanning, Liuzhou, Baise and other regions, which are major corn-producing areas, the early-sown corn has grown to three or four inches tall. Many people's communes have organized cadres and the masses to go deep into the fields to check and replant seedlings and carry out mid-tillage and weeding. By the end of February, a total of 1 million mu had been thinned and replanted, and over 400,000 mu had been cultivated and top-dressed. From February 22nd to 24th, Laibin County applied top dressing to corn on 28.3% of the county's planted area, averaging 90 dan of night soil per mu. Huanjiang County replanted corn in areas with missing seedlings, totaling over 2,400 jin of seeds. Yishan County put forward the slogan "Not a single seedling less, not a single clump missing, strong seedlings everywhere, bumper harvests in every plot," and more than 40,000 people launched a two-day blitz, replanting over 200,000 mu.

Due to the warmer climate this year, various pests and birds have become active earlier. During thinning, replanting, top dressing, and soil consolidation, all localities have further strengthened the prevention and control of pests, birds, and animal damage.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 5th: Sichuan Province is fully engaged in spring plowing and spring planting. The entire province is mobilized, united in purpose and effort, determined to fight this crucial battle well and win a great harvest for the whole year. Currently, between the mountains and rivers of Sichuan, people are plowing and tilling the land, accumulating and transporting fertilizer, and sowing and cultivating seedlings everywhere. As of late February, the province had sown over 2.4 million mu of early rice, 2.1 million mu of early corn, 3 million mu of spring potatoes, and cultivated over 2.3 billion jin of sweet potato seedlings. Economic crops such as cotton and peanuts have also been sown in large quantities. The sugarcane planting task has been basically completed. In Xichang, Luzhou, Yibin and other regions where the season is earlier, the early-sown early rice seedlings have grown to one or two inches long, and are lush and strong.

The vast number of cadres and masses in rural Sichuan are enthusiastically responding to the provincial party committee's call to "resolutely eliminate the three types of seedlings before sowing," and are focusing on quality from the very beginning of spring plowing and spring planting. Experience has shown that a tall building starts from the ground up. If the foundation for sowing is laid well, the crops will emerge evenly and strongly, which will bring initiative to the entire field management work and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, all localities have formulated sowing quality standards as a convention to be implemented, and the vast number of commune members have demonstrated a high degree of awareness in its implementation. Nanchong Region requires that the sowing of each crop achieve five "goods," namely, good base fertilizer application, good cultivation quality, good technical specifications, good timely sowing, and good seedling management. In Wenjiang, Fuling and other regions, specialized teams have been generally established for sowing early corn, and a mutual acceptance system has been established between each work process. One block is sown, one block is accepted, linking each ring tightly and meticulously. In Chenjia Commune, Kai County, some rice paddies were reworked four times before being approved by the masses. The 8.9 million jin of early rice paddies that have been sown in Luzhou Region have generally achieved five plows and six harrows, a deep ploughing of one foot and two inches, and an application of 20,000 jin of base fertilizer, meeting the specifications. Many of the early rice seedlings that have been sown are emerging as first-class seedlings.

    贵州广西四川开始春播
    贵州大搞套种
    新华社贵阳5日电　贵州省从西北高寒山区到东南温热地带，从赤水河到南北盘江的广袤土地上，到处是忙着播种的人群。到2月25日止，全省已播种春马铃薯二百零五万亩，早玉米三百三十九万亩，杂粮一百四十多万亩，水稻育秧十二万多亩。进度快的黔东南苗族侗族自治州和遵义、铜仁两专区，比往年提前一个节令完成和超额完成了春马铃薯、早玉米的播种工作，并且质量良好。据铜仁专区检查，玉米地普遍深耕八寸左右，每亩施底肥五千多斤，种五千到六千株，种子80％以上经过精选和处理。季节较早的赤水、望谟等县，玉米、马铃薯苗都已有二三寸高，长真叶三到四片，葱绿茁壮。
    根据以粮为纲，全面发展的方针，各地在种早种好的同时，积极增加复种，扩大播种面积，力争多种多收。毕节专区70％以上的早播作物地里套种了瓜、豆和油料作物。兴义县由于实行套作，早播作物面积比去年扩大了两倍。各地还在田边地角和“五旁”“四坎”，以及去冬营造的幼林地里，大种瓜类、薯类作物。黔东南苗族侗族自治州在新林地里间作，增种玉米十七万多亩、红薯二千九百多亩。铜仁专区利用田边地角等闲散土地，种了三千多万窝南瓜，六千七百多万株玉米王。遵义专区利用闲散土地，仅播种四季豆一项就达十六万多亩。
    一个“瓜满架，豆满山，消灭零散地，一片米粮川”的增种运动，目前还在贵州高原各地深入开展。
    广西春播进度快
    据新华社南宁5日电　到3月1日统计，广西僮族自治区已播种玉米、高粱、花生等各种春播旱地作物三千三百七十多万亩，比去年同期多种五倍多。早种的已经发芽出土。为了力争春播作物丰收，各地在继续播种的同时，都对见苗的地块及时地加强了管理。
    玉米主要产区南宁、柳州、百色等专区，早种的玉米已长出三、四寸高。许多人民公社都组织干部和群众深入田间，查苗补苗和进行中耕除草，到2月底共已间苗补苗一百万亩，中耕追肥四十多万亩。来宾县从2月22日到24日，玉米追肥面积已占全县种植面积28．3％，平均每亩淋水粪九十担。环江县对缺苗的玉米地进行了补种，共补种种子二千四百多斤。宜山县提出“一苗不少，一兜不缺，苗苗粗壮，块块丰收”的口号，四万多人突击两天，共补苗二十多万亩。
    由于今年气候较暖，各种害虫、鸟兽出来活动较早。各地在间苗、补苗和追肥培土中，还进一步加强了防治虫、鸟、兽害的工作。
    四川狠抓播种质量
    新华社成都5日电　四川省春耕春播工作全面展开了。全省人民总动员，一条心、一股劲地决心打好这关键性的一仗，夺取全年大丰收。目前，巴山蜀水之间到处是犁田整地、积肥运肥、播种育秧的人群。到2月下旬，全省已播种早稻二百四十多万亩、早玉米二百一十万亩、春洋芋三百万亩，育红薯苗种二十三亿多斤。棉花、花生等经济作物也都大量下种。甘蔗播种任务已基本完成。季节较早的西昌、泸州、宜宾等专区，早播的早稻秧苗已长到一两寸长，葱绿粗壮。
    四川农村广大干部和群众热烈响应省委发出的“坚决把三类苗消灭在播种之前”的号召，在春耕春播一开始就狠抓质量。经验表明：万丈高楼从地起。播种基础打好了，庄稼一出土就整齐粗壮，就会给整个田间管理工作带来主动，收到事半功倍的效果。因此各地都制定了播种质量标准，作为公约执行，广大社员在执行中表现了高度的自觉性。南充专区各县要求每项作物播种工作做到五好，即底肥施好，耕作质量好，技术规格好，及时播种好，苗期管理好。温江、涪陵等专区在播种早玉米时，普遍建立了专业队，各工序之间订立互相验收制度，播种一块，验收一块，环环扣紧，一丝不苟。开县陈家公社有些秧田，连续返工四次，才经群众验收通过。泸州专区已播种的八百九十万斤早稻秧田，一般都做到五犁六耙、深耕一尺二寸、施底肥两万斤，达到规格要求。许多播下的早稻一出土就是一类苗。
