The joint communiqué stated, "During the visit to Afghanistan, Khrushchev held meetings and talks with His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir Shah, His Royal Highness Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud, and other members of the Afghan government. In these sincere and fully understanding meetings and talks, friendly exchanges of views were conducted on issues related to Soviet-Afghan relations, including extremely important international issues such as the situation in the Middle East and Southeast Asia."

The joint communiqué stated, "Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and Afghan Prime Minister Daoud expressed deep satisfaction with the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, and friendly cooperation. Both sides affirmed that the current good neighborly and friendly relations, which have stood the test of time, will be further strengthened in the future, for the benefit of the two peoples."

The joint communiqué reiterated, "The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan are a positive and beneficial factor for the cause of peace in the Middle East and Southeast Asia."

The joint communiqué stated, "In the course of the exchange of views, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud reaffirmed Afghanistan's policy of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs. The Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers stated that this policy of Afghanistan is an important contribution to easing international tensions and is deeply respected by the Soviet Union."

The joint communiqué stated, "Both sides believe that military blocs will never contribute to strengthening peace, and that this great goal can only be achieved through the joint efforts and friendly cooperation of countries, large and small."

The joint communiqué stated that both sides expressed the firm hope that the peoples of all countries that have not yet gained freedom will be able to achieve this ideal soon.

"The Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of economic cooperation between the two countries, and that the goals and principles of Soviet economic assistance to friendly Afghanistan are correctly understood."

The joint communiqué stated, "Khrushchev stated that the Soviet Union will continue to pay due attention to the economic needs of the Afghan nation in the future and will assist it in further strengthening and developing its economy."

The joint communiqué stated, "Both sides agreed that the fruitful development of economic cooperation between the two countries is a manifestation of the current good neighborly relations and friendship between the two countries."

The joint communiqué stated, "Both sides declared that they will not allow their current friendly and good neighborly relations to be damaged in any way."

The joint communiqué stated that both sides expressed their firm conviction that Khrushchev's visit and his meetings and talks with Afghan national leaders will further strengthen the traditional friendly and good neighborly relations between the two countries.

This invitation has been accepted by them. The dates of the visits will be agreed upon separately.

    联合公报说，“苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和阿富汗首相达乌德对苏联同阿富汗之间以和平共处、互相尊重和友好合作的原则为基础的友好关系的发展深为满意。双方肯定，目前这种经过了足够的时间考验的睦邻友好关系今后将进一步加强，以有利于两国人民。”

    联合公报说，“赫鲁晓夫声明，苏联今后仍将以应有的注意对待阿富汗国家的经济需要，并且将援助它进一步加强和发展经济。”

    联合公报说，“双方声明，它们不会允许它们目前的友好睦邻关系遭到任何损害。”
