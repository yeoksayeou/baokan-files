Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 17th: According to newspapers here today, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, spoke on the Six-Year Plan (1960-1965) and other issues at the Romanian Workers' Party Croş Region Representative Conference on the 13th.

    The Production of the Industrial Sector is Rapidly Increasing, with Farmer Households Joining Cooperatives Accounting for 76.4% of the Total Number of Farmer Households
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the directives of the Second Congress of the Workers' Party (1955) stipulated that during the period from 1956 to 1960, the entire industrial production should increase by 60%-65%. This task is being completed, and some industrial sectors may even overfulfill it. This will create favorable conditions for the high-speed development of the economy in the coming years.
    Compared with 1955, the production of Romania's ferrous metallurgy industry and machine manufacturing industry will more than double in 1960, and the chemical industry will increase by 1.3 times. The national ten-year electrification plan (1951-1960) will be completed almost one year ahead of schedule.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Second Congress of the Workers' Party stipulated that in 1960, the socialist agricultural sector would occupy a dominant position in terms of both land area and commodity output. This task has already been completed by the end of 1959. As of March 1 this year, the cultivated land area of the socialist agricultural sector has accounted for 76.6% of the country's total cultivated land area, and the farmer households joining socialist agriculture have accounted for 76.4% of the country's total number of farmer households.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that, according to the instructions of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, a draft of the six-year economic development plan and a draft of the long-term plan for the development of the national economy until 1975 are now being formulated, and will be submitted to the Third Congress of the Workers' Party for discussion.

    To Realize the Historical Task of the Six-Year Plan, We Must Vigorously Implement the Policy of Industrialization
    During the period of 1960-1965, the fundamental task of the Party is to roughly complete socialist construction and transition to a new stage of thoroughly completing socialist construction. The general line for realizing this historical task is: vigorously continue to implement the national industrialization policy, and take the development of heavy industry, with the machine manufacturing industry as the vanguard, as the focus of attention. Only by realizing high-speed industrialization can we catch up with the level of advanced industrial countries in terms of production and per capita consumption in a very short period of time. The six-year economic plan stipulates that the production of electricity, steel, machine manufacturing, chemical, timber, building materials, and daily necessities industries should be greatly increased, and agricultural production should be developed rapidly and in many ways.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the latest technologies should be promoted in all sectors of the national economy, the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production should be promoted, technological processes should be improved, and industrial specialization and collaboration should be implemented in order to achieve high-quality production and meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people.

    The High-Speed Development of the National Economy is the Characteristic of This Year's National Plan
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the main task we face today is to mobilize the entire working people and utilize all resources to realize the 1960 national plan. 1960 is the first year of the six-year economic plan, so completing and overfulfilling the tasks of this year's plan is of particularly important significance for the entire stage of 1960-1965. The characteristic of the 1960 national plan is the high-speed development of the national economy. Industrial production will increase by 14% in 1960. According to statistics, the industrial production plan for the first two months of this year has been completed by 102.5%. This means that industrial production during this period will increase by 17% compared to the same period last year. In January and February, 6,500 tons of pig iron, 20,000 tons of steel, 16,500 tons of cement, and 400,000 square meters of cotton fabrics were produced above plan. These achievements show that we are fully capable of completing and overfulfilling the 1960 national plan.

    The Ranks of Party Organizations are Expanding Year by Year, and the Worker Component of Party Members is Constantly Increasing
    When talking about the work of the Party, Gheorghiu-Dej said that in the struggle to realize the Party's political line of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, the mobilization and organizational role of Party organs and Party organizations has been enhanced. The ranks of the Party are expanding year by year. By the end of 1959, the number of Party members and probationary members had reached 807,140, an increase of 200,000 compared with the time of the Second Congress of the Workers' Party; among them, 51% of Party members are workers, 21% are farmers, and 24% are intellectuals and staff. The increase in the number of Party members and the worker component, as well as the improvement in the composition of Party organizations, play a decisive role in improving the activities of Party organizations and improving the efficiency of their mobilization work. Party organizations should continue to follow the instructions repeatedly repeated by our Party: what is important in the Party is not the quantity of Party members but the quality of Party members, the determination they show to complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party at all costs, and the vigilance and combativeness they show in opposing the enemies of socialism.

    The Party Pays Great Attention to Ideological Education Work and Helps Intellectuals Master Marxism-Leninism
    Gheorghiu-Dej then talked about the Party's ideological work. He said that our Party pays great attention to ideological work and political education work for the working people. He said that special attention should be paid to the education of young workers, farmers, and students. The Party's decision on carrying out ideological work among teaching staff and intellectuals is very important. Carrying out ideological work among intellectuals, so that they master the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism, is of particular importance, because a considerable part of the intellectuals are old intellectuals.

    Idealistic Views of Intellectuals Should be Exposed and Subjected to Principled Criticism
    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that an important task of Party organizations in ideological work is to expose and conduct principled criticism of the backward views of intellectuals, the anti-scientific nature of idealistic and mystical philosophical "systems," and the nationalist theories in historical, linguistic, and literary issues prevalent among some ideologically backward Romanian and Hungarian old intellectuals. Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Party has been and is very patient with the old intellectuals, helping them to liberate themselves from old ideas and enabling them to master the dialectical materialist worldview. At the same time, the Party also resolutely criticizes the influence of any alien ideology, as well as any attempt to "reconcile" revolutionary proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that many literary and art workers in Croş City and Croş Region have made great achievements in their work, and they have written many valuable works. However, Party organs and Party organizations should also resolutely criticize the phenomenon of detachment from life manifested in the creations of some writers and artists. They rarely reflect the image of socialist construction and the heroes engaged in this construction in their works, but instead indulge in the past or engage in the creation of overly narrow and unimportant themes, paying no attention to the content of the works but pursuing so-called formal originality. Such writers will inevitably become mediocre in their creative activities, they can only win the cheap praise of some literati, but the people—the object that any true work of art should serve—reject them.

    Open Debate on Ideological and Academic Issues is a Valuable Form of Conducting Ideological Work
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that one of the most valuable forms of conducting ideological work among intellectuals is to launch open debates on issues of ideological, scientific, and artistic creation. This form is also the best way to expose the elements hostile to socialism and the working people in the literary and art circles. As everyone knows, not long ago, Romania exposed some ghosts of the old era who insulted the title of cultural figures and citizens of our country. They tried their best to slander the Romanian people and their creative labor. Romanian cultural figures repelled the attacks of these elements.
    Gheorghiu-Dej finally said that a major event in the life of our Party—the Third Congress of the Party is about to be held. This Party Congress will mobilize the working people to struggle for new achievements in the cause of socialist construction.

    乔治乌—德治谈新六年计划的基本任务
    罗马尼亚进入社会主义建设的新阶段
    据新华社布加勒斯特17日电据这里的报纸今天报道，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治13日在罗马尼亚工人党克罗什州代表会议上就六年计划（1960—1965年）等问题讲了话。
    工业部门的生产飞速增长入社农户占总农户76．4％
    乔治乌—德治说，工人党第二次代表大会（1955年）的指示规定，在1956年到1960年期间，整个工业生产应增长60％—65％。这个任务正在完成中，有些工业部门还可以超额完成。这将为今后几年高速度发展经济创造良好的条件。
    同1955年比较，1960年罗马尼亚黑色冶金工业和机器制造工业的生产都将增长一倍多，化学工业将增长一点三倍。国家十年电气化计划（1951—1960年）差不多将提前一年完成。
    乔治乌—德治说，工人党第二次代表大会规定，在1960年，社会主义农业部门不论在土地面积或商品产量方面都将占优势地位。这一任务已经在1959年底完成了。到今年3月1日为止，社会主义农业部门的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的76．6％，加入社会主义农业的农户已占全国农户的76．4％。
    乔治乌—德治说，根据党中央政治局的指示，现在正在制定六年经济发展计划草案和到1975年的国民经济发展远景计划草案，并将提交工人党第三次代表大会讨论。
    实现六年计划的历史任务必须大力执行工业化政策
    在1960—1965年期间，党的根本任务是：大体上完成社会主义建设和过渡到彻底完成社会主义建设的新阶段。而实现这个历史任务的总路线是：大力地继续执行国家工业化政策，把以机器制造业为先锋的重工业的发展作为注意的中心。只有实现高速度的工业化，才能使我们在极短的时期内在生产和按人口平均计算的消费量方面赶上先进的工业国家的水平。六年经济计划规定要大大地增加电力、钢铁、机器制造、化学、木材、建筑材料、日用品工业的生产，迅速和多方面地发展农业生产。
    乔治乌—德治说，应该在国民经济的一切部门中推广最新的技术，推广生产的全面机械化和自动化，改进工艺过程，实行工业的专业化和协作，以求能够实现一个高质量的生产，满足人民群众不断增长的物质和文化需要。
    国民经济的高速度发展是今年国家计划的特点
    乔治乌—德治说，我们今天面临的主要任务是动员全体劳动人民和利用全部资源，以实现1960年的国家计划。1960年是六年经济计划的第一年，因此完成和超额完成这一年计划的任务，对1960—1965年的整个阶段具有特别重要的意义。1960年国家计划的特点是国民经济发展的高速度。1960年工业生产将增长14％。根据统计，今年头两个月的工业生产计划已经以102．5％完成了。这就是说，这一时期的工业生产要比去年同时期增加17％。1月和2月超计划生产了六千五百吨生铁、两万吨钢、一万六千五百吨水泥、四十万平方米棉织品，这些成就表明我们完全有条件完成和超额完成1960年的国家计划。
    党组织的队伍一年年扩大党员的工人成份不断增加
    乔治乌—德治在谈到党的工作时说，在实现党的关于社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的政治路线的斗争中，党机关和党组织的动员和组织作用有了提高。党的队伍一年年扩大，到1959年底，党员和预备党员人数已达到八十万七千一百四十人，比工人党第二次代表大会时期增加了二十万人；其中51％的党员是工人，21％是农民，24％是知识分子和职员。党员人数和工人成分的增加，以及党组织成份的改善，对改进党组织的活动，提高它的动员工作的效率起着决定性的作用。党组织应该继续遵循我们党所多次重复的指示：在党内重要的不是党员的数量而是党员的质量，是他们不惜一切地为完成党交给他们的任务所表现出来的决心，为反对社会主义敌人所表现的警惕性和战斗性。
    党非常注意思想教育的工作帮助知识分子掌握马列主义
    乔治乌—德治接着谈到了党的思想工作。他说，我们的党非常注意思想工作和对劳动人民群众进行政治教育工作。他说，要特别注意对青年工人、农民和学生的教育。党关于在教学工作的干部和知识分子中进行思想工作的决定是很重要的。在知识分子中进行思想工作，使他们掌握马克思列宁主义的哲学，具有特别的重要性，因为知识分子中的相当大的部分都是旧知识分子。
    对知识分子的唯心主义观点要进行揭发和原则性的批判
    乔治乌—德治指出，党组织在思想工作方面的一项重要任务就是要对知识分子中的落后观点、唯心主义和神秘主义的哲学“体系”的反科学性，以及在一部分思想落后的罗马尼亚族和匈牙利族旧知识分子中流行的有关历史、语言、文学问题中的民族主义的理论进行揭发和进行原则性的批判。乔治乌—德治说，党过去和现在都很耐心地对待旧知识分子，帮助他们从旧思想中解放出来，并使他们掌握辩证唯物主义的世界观，同时，党也坚决地批判任何异己思想的影响，以及任何企图“调和”革命无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的倾向。
    乔治乌—德治说，克罗什城和克罗什州的许多文学艺术工作者在工作中都取得了很大的成绩，他们写出了许多有价值的作品。但是，党机关和党组织还应该坚决地批判在某些作家和艺术家的创作中所表现出来的脱离生活的现象，他们在作品中很少反映社会主义建设和进行这种建设的英雄的形象，而是沉缅于过去或从事于过于狭窄的、缺乏重要意义的题材的创作，不注意作品的内容而追求所谓形式上的独创。这样的作家不可避免地在他们的创作活动中将会变得平庸，他们只能博得某些文人的廉价的赞扬，但是人民——任何真正的艺术作品所应该服务的对象——拒绝了他们。
    对思想学术问题的公开辩论是进行思想工作的宝贵形式
    乔治乌—德治说，在知识分子中进行思想工作的最宝贵的形式之一就是展开对思想、科学和艺术创作问题的公开辩论。这种形式也是在文艺界面前揭露同社会主义和劳动人民为敌的分子的最好形式。正如大家所知道的，不久以前，罗马尼亚曾揭露了一些旧时代的鬼魂，侮辱了作为文化人士和我国公民的称号，他们曾极力诬蔑罗马尼亚人民和他们的创造性劳动。罗马尼亚的文化界人士击退了这些分子的进攻。
    乔治乌—德治最后说，我们党的生活中的重大事件——党的第三次代表大会即将召开。这次党代表大会将动员劳动人民在社会主义建设事业中为争取新的成就而斗争。
