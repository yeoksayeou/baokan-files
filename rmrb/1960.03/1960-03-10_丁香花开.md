    Lilac Blossoms Bloom
    Liu Xinwu
    Two years ago, on her first day teaching at the school, the first thing she saw when she walked into the teachers' lounge was a vase of lilacs placed on her desk. A note was tucked under the vase: "Respected teacher, at the meet-and-greet you said you liked flowers, so we put this bouquet in a vase for you, okay? Your students." Seeing this, she was deeply moved.

    From then on, there was always a vase of fresh flowers on Bao Rong's desk. In spring, it was lilacs; in summer, passionflowers and jasmine; in autumn, crabapples and wild chrysanthemums. Even in winter, the children would carefully lay pebbles at the bottom of the vase and grow daffodils. Some of these flowers were grown in the children's homes, and some were picked from the wild. Each time, in addition to the main flowers, the vase would always be adorned with some wild grasses and flowers that Bao Rong couldn't name. Bao Rong prepared lessons, graded homework, made work plans for the class, wrote summaries, and graded papers at this desk every day. Whenever she was tired, just seeing the vase of fresh flowers on the corner of the desk would make her forget all her fatigue and work even harder. Once, Bao Rong didn't explain a few new words in the text clearly to the children, and she felt uneasy all day. There was only one junior high class in the school, and she was the only Chinese teacher. She asked the other teachers, but they couldn't explain it either. She looked it up in the dictionary, but the dictionary was too simple. What to do? It seemed there was only one way: to go to the county high school, twenty miles away, to ask an experienced teacher. But was it worth it for a few words? As she pondered, her eyes turned to the vase of flowers. She seemed to see the hearts of forty children, thirsty for knowledge, beating before her eyes. She suddenly wrapped her scarf around her head and ran twenty miles against the wind and sand. When she had figured out these few words at the county high school and returned, full of joy, it was already evening. The next day, it only took a few minutes for the children to fully understand the meaning of these words, but Bao Rong had spent so much effort preparing the lesson for those few short minutes!

    Later, Bao Rong found that the order during self-study was very chaotic. Not only did the children take ten minutes after the bell to barely settle down, but some football fans would secretly go out to play football. Those who stayed in the classroom would read comic books, flick paper airplanes... So she decided to attend self-study with the children. The first time, she arrived at the classroom five minutes early. First, she tidied up her desk and straightened the vase of flowers. As soon as the bell rang, she sat down quietly and concentrated on preparing lessons and reading reference books. At first, the children were nervous, thinking that the teacher would definitely criticize them severely, but seeing that the teacher was also like a student, silently studying, they were too embarrassed to sneak out and play.

    Spring arrived again. Bao Rong returned from attending the Heroes' Conference in the city. She didn't go back to her dormitory but ran to the classroom first. The children had all finished school and gone home, but the vase on the desk in front of the classroom was still filled with freshly bloomed lilacs. Bao Rong sat at the desk, and like the first time she came to the school, her heart churned again. She thought about all the things that had happened in the past two years. As she thought, she couldn't help but take out her beloved notebook and write in neat handwriting: Always be a red teacher!

    丁香花开
    刘心武
    两年以前，到学校教课的第一天，当她走进教员休息室时，头一眼看到的就是供在她桌上的一瓶丁香花。瓶底下压着一张纸条：“敬爱的老师，在见面会上您说您喜欢花，所以我们把这束花给您插在瓶里，好吗？您的学生们。”她看到这情景，心头非常激动。
    从此以后，保荣的桌上总会有一瓶鲜花。春天是丁香，夏天是西番莲、茉莉花，秋天是海棠和野菊花，即使是冬天，孩子们也会细心地在瓶底铺上卵石，养上水仙。这些花，有的是孩子们家里种的，有的是他们到野地里采来的，每次花瓶里除了主要的花外，总还要点缀一些保荣叫不出名字的野草野花。保荣每天在这桌上备课、改作业、订班上的工作计划、写总结、批卷子……每当她累了的时候，只要一看见桌角的一瓶鲜花，就会忘记了一切疲劳，更加努力地工作起来。有一次，保荣没把课文中的几个生词给孩子们讲懂，她一天都不舒服。学校里只有一个初中班，语文教师只是自己一个，问其他的老师，他们也说不清，查字典，字典上又太简单，怎么办呢？看来只有一个办法：到二十里外的县立中学去请教老教师。可是为了几个词，值得吗？正思索，她的眼睛转到了花瓶上。她好像看到了四十颗渴求知识的孩子的心在她眼前跳动。她猛地围上围巾，顶着风沙一气跑了二十里。当她在县立中学搞通了这几个词，满心欢喜地回来时，已经是晚上了。第二天，只用了几分钟，孩子们就完全搞通了这几个词的涵义，但为这短短的几分钟，保荣却花费了多少劳动备课啊！
    后来，保荣发觉上自习课的秩序很乱。孩子们不但要在打铃十分钟后才能勉强安静下来，而且有几个球迷还会偷偷出去踢球，留在教室里的也有人看小人书的、弹飞机的……，于是她决心和孩子们一块上自习。头一次，她提前五分钟到了教室，首先整理了一下桌面，把花瓶摆正，铃声一响，她就安静地坐下来，用心地备课、看参考书。开初，孩子们很紧张，以为老师一定会严厉地指责他们，可是看到老师也像个学生一样，默不作声地上自习，他们就再不好意思偷跑出去玩了。
    春天又到了。保荣从市里参加群英会回来，没回宿舍，先跑到教室里去。孩子们都已散学回家了，可是教室前办公桌上的花瓶里，却依然插满刚开的丁香。保荣坐在桌旁，像第一次到学校一样，心里又翻腾起来。她想起两年来的种种事情。想着想着，她不自禁地拿出自己心爱的记事本来，用笔在上面工工整整地写了几个大字：永远做一个红色的教师！
