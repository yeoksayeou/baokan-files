    The question of whether amateur learning can be successful depends on persistence. Whether amateur learning can be sustained depends primarily on how production and learning are understood and appropriately arranged. Today, this newspaper publishes news about the flourishing "Iron People's Schools" in Fujian. The reason these "Iron People's Schools" have been able to persist is that they recognize the importance of workers and peasants learning culture and have appropriately resolved the contradiction between production and learning in terms of time. Therefore, this school has become a school that "cannot be scattered by the wind, cannot be ruined by the rain, and remains evergreen throughout the seasons."

    With the continuous leap forward situation on the production front, being busy with production is a fact. However, based on the characteristics of production, rational arrangement of labor organization, and close integration of teaching with production, it is still possible to organize learning even when production is busy. The main characteristic of the Fujian Iron People's School is that teaching goes wherever production goes; it resolutely implements the teaching policy of integrating with production and serving production, and the teaching organization form and time are also adapted to production, flexibly arranged, so the people's school is not dispersed throughout the year, and learning is continuous. This fully proves that the contradiction between production and learning can be completely resolved. It is unrealistic if we leave the task of cultivating talents for when production is not busy in the future. In the future, not only will the tasks be greater and the work will be more, but also new production technology measures will become more and more complex, so there is an urgent need for technical talents in various fields, and in the final analysis, it is still necessary to organize workers and peasants to study culture well.

    Learning is for improving production, and the continuous leap forward of production requires us to learn, they are unified and mutually reinforcing. The "Iron People's School" of Yingdu Commune, due to the double leap forward in learning and production, has not only not affected production, but also cultivated a large number of management cadres and agricultural technicians for the commune, further promoting the leap forward of production. If Yingdu Commune can run an "Iron People's School", other units can also set up "Iron People's Schools". As long as we establish lofty ambitions and seize and squeeze time with perseverance, we will definitely be able to do it and learn well.

    问题在于坚持
　  文举
    业余学习能不能搞好，问题在于坚持。业余学习能不能坚持，首先要看如何认识和适当地安排生产和学习。今天本报发表了福建“铁民校”遍地开花的消息。这些“铁民校”所以能够坚持下来，就是认识了工农学习文化的重要性，并且适当地解决了生产和学习在时间上的矛盾。因此这个学校成了“风吹不散，雨打不烂，四季常青”的学校。
    随着生产战线上持续跃进的形势，生产忙是事实。但是，根据生产的特点，合理安排劳动组织，教学紧密结合生产，就是在生产忙的情况下，也还可以组织学习。福建铁民校的主要特点，就是生产到那里，教学到那里；坚决贯彻结合生产、为生产服务的教学方针，而教学组织形式、时间也都和生产相适应，灵活安排，因而民校常年不散，学习不断。这充分证明了生产和学习的矛盾完全可以解决。如果我们把培养人材的任务要留待将来生产不忙的时候，那是不现实的。将来，不仅任务会更大，活会更多，而且新的生产技术措施也越来越复杂，因而迫切需要有各方面的技术人才，归根结底还要组织工人农民好好学文化。
    学习是为了搞好生产，生产的不断跃进，又要求我们非学不可，它们之间是统一的，是互相促进的。英都公社的“铁民校”，就是由于学习、生产双双跃进，不仅没有影响生产，而且还为公社培养了大量的管理干部和农业技术人才，进一步促进了生产的跃进。英都公社能办“铁民校”，其他单位也是能办起“铁民校”的。只要树起雄心大志，以坚韧不拔的毅力去抓时间、挤时间，就一定能够做得到，学得好。
