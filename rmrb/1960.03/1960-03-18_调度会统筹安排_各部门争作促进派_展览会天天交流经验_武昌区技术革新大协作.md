(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, March 17th) In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, the people of Wuchang District, Wuhan City, promoting the communist spirit, are engaging in large-scale district-wide collaboration and competition, mutually supporting each other, and vigorously pursuing "Seven Transformations" (transforming manual operations into mechanical operations, transforming simple equipment into modern equipment, transforming old machines into new machines, transforming single processes into production lines, transforming backward operating methods into advanced operating methods, transforming heavy manual labor in transportation and loading/unloading into mechanization and semi-mechanization, and transforming mechanization into automation), rapidly changing the technological landscape of the entire district.

Under the situation of rapid development in production, factories in Wuchang District, in order to ensure key areas and support key areas, conducted frequent collaborations last year. In the later stage, the self-organized collaboration between factories developed into daily district-wide scheduling meetings convened by the district's leading organs to make unified arrangements for district-wide collaboration. This integrated the collaboration of various units, ensuring the continuous surge in production, enabling the entire district to achieve an "all-round red" in production in 1959. Since the beginning of this year, with the emergence of a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations across the country, the people of Wuchang District, under the leadership of the district committee, have also launched a vigorous mass movement to pursue "Seven Transformations" with unstoppable momentum, advancing rapidly towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. In this movement, they continued to use and develop the experiences of large-scale collaboration from last year, with one heart and one mind. From February 13th to March 16th, they newly manufactured more than 1,200 pieces of machinery and equipment, modified more than 1,300 pieces of old machinery and equipment, innovated more than 590 types of backward tools and operating methods, and formed more than 260 production lines, increasing the district's level of mechanization from 37% to 60.54%.

The comprehensive large-scale collaboration in Wuchang District has generally formed a noble atmosphere, with numerous examples of communist spirit emerging every day. Everyone acts as a promoter, and the idea of advancing their own work and also promoting the advancement of others is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Many units have organized "visiting the advanced teams" to study counterpart factories, comparing item by item; the visited units also warmly receive them and introduce their experiences. Through these visits and activities, everyone comes up with topics and finds solutions to solve problems in technical innovation. The Wuchang Roundwood Factory used to have one person making four mud buckets a day, which later increased to twelve. After visiting an advanced factory, they realized that they were lagging behind and obtained advanced experience. After returning to the factory, they fought for seven days and created a mechanized and semi-mechanized production line, with an average daily output of 30 pieces per person. Various non-production departments also fully promoted the communist spirit and established the idea of "everything for production." For example, commercial departments openly disclose their inventory and grasp the situation of production departments to help solve relevant problems; the financial and trade system organized "matchmaker teams" that worked day and night to proactively deliver goods to the doorsteps of production departments to help them overcome difficulties in production and technical innovation; residents also formed versatile service organizations to provide various services to production departments. In this way, the past free collaboration and single collaboration have been transformed into organized, led, and planned collaboration, linking each unit's task to the whole.

Holding collaborative exhibitions is a major form of collaboration adopted by Wuchang District. This exhibition includes collaborative competitions, requests for assistance, and treasure offerings, with rich and colorful content. It is not only a classroom for the general line education but also the center for directing the district's movement. It concentrates the latest and most exciting innovation projects that emerge in the district every day and constantly supplements new content. Workers perform actual operations and demonstrations, even disassembling machines, donating drawings, and explaining in detail, without being bothered by detail. This makes the exhibition a place for quickly promoting advanced experiences. Major advanced experiences in Wuchang District can be widely promoted throughout the district on the same day; holding such exhibitions is a major key. Here, the district-wide collaborative competition to march towards mechanization and semi-mechanization attracts large numbers of people every day, and even people from other provinces such as Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Anhui, and Shanxi come to collaborate. All aspects of the district's strength are concentrated to carry out large-scale competitions, large-scale exchanges, and large-scale collaboration. Whoever has difficulties comes here to ask for help; whoever has advanced things also comes here to offer treasures. This method of collaboration is not only lively and active but also rapid and timely, with great results. Often, over a thousand collaborative problems are solved throughout the district in one day.

In the technical innovation movement, various factories have also adopted another effective form of collaboration, that is: uniting to besiege key points and concentrating on helping one factory solve problems. The Xinhua Binding Factory was manufacturing a folding machine but found its own strength to be weak. It invited many units to hold technical guidance meetings. Some helped with sand casting, some helped solve raw material problems, and some helped break through technical barriers. The folding machine was then successfully manufactured. The Ziyang Weaving Factory, a street-run factory, proposed a three-day battle to mechanize and semi-mechanize all manual operations such as sizing, warping, drying, guide cylinders, guide wefts, corner angles, weaving, measuring cloth, and bundling. All the factories in the entire street came to support them, enabling the factory to produce thirteen machines for production within three days, realizing the slogan proposed by the employees.

    调度会统筹安排　各部门争作促进派　展览会天天交流经验
    武昌区技术革新大协作
    本报武汉17日电　在以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，武汉市武昌区人民发扬共产主义风格，大搞全区协作比武，相互支援，大闹“七变”（变手工操作为机械操作，变简易设备为洋设备，变旧机器为新机器，变单一工序为生产流水线，变落后的操作方法为先进的操作方法，变运输装卸中笨重的体力劳动为机械化半机械化，变机械化为自动化），迅速改变着全区的技术面貌。
    武昌区各工厂在生产飞跃发展的形势下，为了确保重点，支援重点，去年曾进行了频繁的协作。到后一阶段，各工厂自行挂钩的协作方式发展成由区的领导机关每天召开全区调度会，对全区协作进行统一安排，这就使各单位的协作形成一个整体，保证了生产的不断高涨，使全区在1959年实现了生产满堂红。今年以来，随着以手工操作机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命高潮在全国出现，武昌区人民在区委的领导下，也以锐不可挡之势，开展了大闹“七变”，高速向机械化、半机械化进军的群众运动。在这个运动中，他们继续运用和发展了去年大协作的经验，一条心，一股劲，从2月13日到3月16日，就新制了一千二百多部机器设备，改制了一千三百多部旧机器设备，革新了五百九十多种落后的工具和操作方法，组成了二百六十多条生产流水线，使全区机械化程度由37％提高到60．54％。
    武昌区全面大协作已经普遍形成一种高尚的风气，共产主义风格的事例每天大量涌现。人人作促进派，自己工作跃进、也要促使别人跃进的思想深入人心。许多单位组织了“访先队”，到先进工厂对口学习，项项对比；被访问单位也热诚接待，介绍经验。通过这种参观访问活动，大家出课题，大家想办法，解决技术革新中的问题。武昌圆木厂过去一天一人作泥桶四个，后来提高到十二个，到先进厂参观，发现自己落后；又获得了先进经验，回厂后奋战七天，创造了一条机械化、半机械化的生产流水线，平均每人日产量达到三十个。各非生产部门也充分发扬共产主义风格，树立“一切为生产”的思想。如商业部门一方面公开库存，一方面掌握生产部门的情况，协助解决有关问题；财贸系统组织了“红娘大队”，夜以继日地四出活动，主动送货上门，帮助生产部门克服生产和技术革新中的困难；居民中也出现了万能服务组织，为生产部门进行各种服务活动。这样，就把过去自由协作、单一协作变为有组织、有领导、有计划的协作，使每个单位的任务同整体联系起来。
    举办协作展览会是武昌区采用的一种主要的协作形式。这种展览会包括有协作比武、求援、献宝等，内容丰富多彩，不但成为总路线教育的课堂，也是指挥全区运动的中心。它把全区每天涌现的最新和最精采的革新项目集中在这里，并且不断补充新的内容。由工人实际操作表演，甚至拆卸机器，赠送图纸，细讲细说，不厌其详。这就使展览会成为快速推广先进经验的场所。武昌区出现的重大先进经验，当天就能够在全区范围内普遍推广，举办这种展览会是个重大的关键。这里，全区性的向机械化、半机械化进军的协作比武大会，每天都吸引大批的人，连省外如江苏、河南、河北、湖南、安徽、山西等都有人来进行协作。全区各方面力量都集中起来，开展大比武、大交流、大协作。谁有困难，就到这里求援；谁有先进的东西，也来这里献宝。这种协作的方式，既生动活泼，又迅速及时，收效很大。往往一天之内，全区就解决了上千个协作问题。
    在技术革新运动中，各个工厂还采用了另一种有效的协作形式，这就是：联合起来，围攻关键，集中帮助一个工厂解决问题。新华装订厂制造括页机，自己力量薄弱，请了许多单位举行技术指导会，有的帮助翻砂，有的帮助解决原材料或突破技术关，括页机便制造成功。街办工厂——紫阳织布厂职工提出大战三天，使浆纱、打纱、甩干、导筒、导纬、洋角、织布、量布、打捆等手工操作，全部实现机械化、半机械化，全街所有工厂都来支援，使该厂在三天内制出了十三部机器投入生产，实现了职工提出的口号。
