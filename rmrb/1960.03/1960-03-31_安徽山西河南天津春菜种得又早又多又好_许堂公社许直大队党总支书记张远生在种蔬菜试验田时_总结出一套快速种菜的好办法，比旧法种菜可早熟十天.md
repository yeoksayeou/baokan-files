    Anhui, Shanxi, Henan, and Tianjin Plant Spring Vegetables Early, Abundantly, and Well
    Zhang Yuansheng, Party Branch Secretary of Xuzhi Brigade, Xutang Commune, Summarizes a Good Method for Quick Vegetable Planting in Experimental Plots, Resulting in Ripening Ten Days Earlier Than with Old Methods
    (Our Report) Anhui Province has planted over 6 million mu of spring vegetables, exceeding the original requirement of two fen per person. Currently, commune members in various people's communes are watering and fertilizing the newly planted vegetable fields, actively strengthening field management to ensure sufficient water and fertilizer, and increase yields.
    When planning spring vegetable production, people's communes in Anhui Province explicitly put forward the slogan "Equal emphasis on quantity and quality, plant more and harvest more." Various localities have universally organized specialized teams, adopting methods of contracting planting, management, and quality, focusing on the quality of vegetable planting. Lingbi County’s Lingcheng Commune has already planted over 20,000 mu of spring vegetables, universally deep plowing to eight cun, applying 300 dan of fertilizer per mu, and ensuring large plots are converted into raised beds and small plots into garden plots. Quanjiao County has already planted over 50,000 mu of spring vegetables, all with sufficient base fertilizer and meeting the standard of raised beds. To ensure that vegetable production is harvested after planting and yields are high, communes, brigades, and production teams have also established vegetable production bases to take the lead, improve technology, and promote experience. Zhang Yuansheng, Party Branch Secretary of Xuzhi Brigade, Xutang Commune, Funan County, summarized a good method for quick vegetable planting while establishing a vegetable base. In his five mu vegetable experiment field, he adopted methods such as shallow watering, frequent irrigation, and watering the roots without wetting the heart when planting vegetables, causing the planted vegetables to turn green in three days; for sown vegetables, he adopted the method of first scattering and watering, then flooding, resulting in germination in two days, maturing ten days earlier than with old methods.
    To reduce the occupation of cultivated land for vegetable production, in addition to fully utilizing wasteland, around houses, and vacant land for planting vegetables, various localities have also adopted methods such as intercropping, relay cropping, mixed cropping, and multiple cropping, combining long-term and short-term vegetables, coarse and fine vegetables, and appropriately adjusting peak and off-peak seasons to achieve year-round greenery and fresh vegetables throughout the year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th: Early planning, early action, rapid progress, and high quality are the characteristics of vegetable production in Shanxi Province this year. Currently, preparatory work for vegetable production has been basically completed throughout the province. Parts of southern and central Shanxi have begun sowing spring vegetables and starting summer vegetable seedlings. Taiyuan City, which started earlier, has completed half of its sowing plan, advancing the sowing period by half a month to twenty days compared to previous years. Vegetable production conditions are also better than in previous years. The area of ​​irrigated vegetable land in the province has doubled compared to last year. Various localities have also focused on the management of overwintering vegetables. Some spring vegetables in southern Shanxi and Taiyuan City have already entered the market. It is estimated that the province's spring vegetable market supply this year will increase by 100% compared to last year.
    This year's total vegetable output in Shanxi Province is required to increase by 85% compared to the bumper harvest of 1959. To complete this plan, and to avoid competing for land with grain, cotton, oil crops, and other crops, various localities, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, have found many good methods to expand the area of vegetable cultivation and increase yield per unit area. First, conscientiously and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture to increase yield per unit area, with particular emphasis on solving water and fertilizer issues. Second, multiple cropping to maximize land utilization. Last year, Jie Zhou People's Commune in Yuncheng County achieved eight crops with seven harvests and six crops with six harvests by adopting methods such as mixed planting, alternate row cultivation, and seedling cultivation. This year, all localities are required to universally plant old vegetable fields with four crops. Third, after the wheat harvest, use a portion of the wheat fields to replant vegetables. Fourth, vigorously promote intercropping and strip cropping. Various localities should supplement or strip crop radishes, turnips, kohlrabi, and other vegetables in corn, sorghum, millet, bean, and cotton fields.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th: A mass movement for everyone to take action and plant vegetables on all vacant land has been launched in various parts of Henan Province. According to statistics, more than 5 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed throughout the province, of which more than 4 million mu have been planted with spring vegetables and other cash crops. Taikang, Suiping, Xin County, Biyang, and other counties and many communes and teams have met or exceeded the requirements of planting two to three fen of spring vegetables and twenty squash nests per person.
    The rapid and vigorous development of the movement to plant spring vegetables on vacant land in Henan Province is mainly due to the implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link in agriculture and comprehensively developing diversified operations. The Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Henan Provincial People's Committee have continuously issued urgent instructions and held telephone and broadcast conferences, calling on the vast number of commune members throughout the province to make full use of vacant and marginal land to plant more spring vegetables, requiring each person to plant two to three fen of spring vegetables and twenty squash nests. All prefectures, cities, and counties have made specific arrangements based on these instructions. Fugou County, under the premise of ensuring drought resistance for wheat irrigation and spring planting, mobilized 20,000 troops to work hard for a month, reclaiming 130,000 mu of wasteland, most of which was deep plowed, fertilized, leveled, and ridged, basically achieving garden-like conditions, with 91,000 mu planted with spring vegetables and other cash crops. All agencies, factories, troops, and schools also actively reclaimed wasteland during their spare time to plant vegetables, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables.
    Various localities have also planted according to local conditions, based on the characteristics of small and dispersed wasteland plots. Biyang, focusing on the characteristics of many mountains, ridges, gullies, and hills in the territory, launched a movement to plant squash ridges, squash gullies, squash hills, and ten-mile long dike squash nets. When planning planting varieties, in addition to ensuring there are vegetables to eat throughout the year, various localities have also planted a large number of early-maturing and fast-growing vegetables. Hua County promoted a cultivation method that combines tall plants with low plants; long growing seasons with short growing seasons; and deep roots with shallow roots, resulting in the county planting more, faster, and better vegetables. Most of the planted 170,000 mu of spring vegetables have emerged from the soil.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th: The people's communes in the suburbs of Tianjin are doing everything possible to increase the production of early spring vegetables. In previous years, early spring vegetables were just being sown around the time of Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects), but this year, the more than 40,000 mu of early spring vegetables sown in the suburbs of the city have already emerged from the soil, and the sown area has also increased significantly compared to last year.
    This spring, after the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee issued a call to the vast number of peasants in the suburbs to "sow early, harvest early, and shorten the off-season of vegetable supply," cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians from various communes actively studied "early" methods. Everyone studied and acted, stepping up land preparation, fertilizer delivery, and seed treatment to prepare for the early sowing of spring vegetables. After research by the technology research group of Huantuo Production Team, Xingdian Commune, Hebei District, the team sowed more than 100 mu of small radishes 26 days earlier than last year. Now, the 30 mu of radish seedlings have grown to two cun high. In the sowing of early spring vegetables, the communes also ensured a variety of varieties. After the Beginning of Spring, the Guanzhuangzi Production Team of Xinli Village Commune sent people to the district vegetable company and steel plant to solicit opinions, and immediately convened a forum of experienced farmers to study increasing vegetable varieties. Wangzhuang Production Team of Beicang Commune has successfully tested the cultivation of cucumbers in early spring. Now, the cucumbers they planted have emerged from the soil, have begun to branch, and are growing vigorously.
    In the production of early spring vegetables, there was also extensive cooperation between communes and production teams. As many production teams were planting early spring vegetables on a large scale for the first time this year, they lacked cold-proof equipment and seeds, and also lacked experience in cultivation techniques. To overcome these difficulties, the communes have carried out extensive cooperation. The Dazhangzhuang Production Team of Xingdian Commune did not plant any early spring vegetables last year, but this year they will plant a large amount. After the Nansunzhuang Management District learned about this, it immediately sent four of its most skilled experienced farmers with seeds to Dazhangzhuang. Now, Dazhangzhuang has planted 500 mu of nine kinds of early spring vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and spinach.

    安徽山西河南天津春菜种得又早又多又好
    许堂公社许直大队党总支书记张远生在种蔬菜试验田时
    总结出一套快速种菜的好办法，比旧法种菜可早熟十天
    本报讯　安徽省已种春菜六百多万亩，超额达到了原定每人种菜两分地的要求。目前各人民公社的社员正在新种的菜地上浇水施肥，积极加强蔬菜田间管理，保证菜田水满肥足，增加产量。
    安徽省各人民公社在一开始安排春菜生产时，就明确提出了“数量、质量同时并重，多种多收”的口号。各地普遍组织专业队，采取包种、包管、包质量的办法，狠抓种菜质量。灵璧县灵城公社已种的二万多亩春菜，普遍深耕八寸，每亩施肥三百担，并且做到大片畦田化，小片园田化。全椒县已种的五万多亩春菜，全部施足了基肥，并且达到了畦田化的标准。为使蔬菜生产种了必收，收必高产，各公社、大队、生产队还建立了蔬菜生产基地，以便先走一步，提高技术，推广经验。阜南县许堂公社许直大队党总支书记张远生在建立蔬菜基地中，总结出了一套快速种菜的好办法。他种的五亩蔬菜试验田，在栽菜时，采取浅浇水、勤灌水，浇根不浇心等办法，使栽下的菜三天就返青；播种的菜，采取先撒浇，后漫灌的办法，两天就出芽，比旧法栽菜种菜提前十天成熟。
    为使蔬菜生产少占用耕地，各地除充分利用荒地、家前屋后及空隙地种菜外，还采取间种、套种、混种、复种等办法，并做到长期菜和短期菜相结合，粗菜和细菜相结合，旺季和淡季适当调剂，以便达到四季常青，一年到头都能吃到新鲜蔬菜。
    据新华社太原30日电　安排早、动手早、进度快、质量高，是山西省今年蔬菜生产的特点。目前全省各地蔬菜生产备耕工作已基本就绪。晋南和晋中部分地区已开始播种春菜和着手夏菜育苗，动手较早的太原市已经完成了播种计划的一半，播种期比往年提早半月至二十天。今年蔬菜生产条件也比往年好。全省水地蔬菜面积，比去年扩大了一倍。各地都抓住了越冬蔬菜管理，晋南和太原市的部分春菜已经上市，预计全省今年春菜的上市量可比去年增加一倍。
    山西省今年的蔬菜总产量，要求比大丰收的1959年增加85％。为完成这个计划，又做到不与粮食、棉花、油料及其他各项作物争地，各地在各级党委领导下，都找到了许多扩大蔬菜耕地面积和提高单位面积产量的好办法。首先是认真地全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提高单位面积产量，其中特别要解决好水和肥的问题。第二，多种茬次，充分发挥土地利用率。运城县解州人民公社，在去年种菜中，由于采取了混种、隔畦栽培、育苗培植等办法，实现了八种七收和六种六收。今年各地都要求老菜田普遍种到四茬。第三，在小麦收获后，用一部分麦田，复播蔬菜。第四，大搞套种、带种。各地要在玉米、高粱、谷子、豆类、棉花等地内，补种或带种萝卜、蔓青、芥圪塔等蔬菜。
    据新华社郑州30日电　人人动手，利用一切空闲地，大种蔬菜的群众运动，已在河南省各地开展起来。据统计：全省开垦荒地已达五百余万亩，其中四百多万亩已经种上了春菜和其它经济作物。太康、遂平、新县、泌阳等县和不少社队已经达到或超额完成了每人种春菜二、三分、南瓜二十窝的要求。
    河南省利用空闲地大种春菜运动所以开展的迅速猛烈，主要是贯彻执行农业以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针。中共河南省委和河南省人民委员会，曾连续发出紧急指示，召开电话会和广播会等，号召全省广大社员，充分利用闲地、隙地多种春菜，要求每人种春菜二分到三分，种南瓜二十窝。各专、市、县都根据指示作了具体布置。扶沟县在保证抗旱浇麦春播的前提下，出动二万大军，大干一个月，开垦荒地十三万亩，其中大部分进行了深翻、施肥、平整、打畦，基本实现园田化，有九万一千多亩种上了春菜和其它经济作物。各机关、工厂、部队、学校也都利用空隙时间，积极开荒种菜，力争蔬菜达到自给自足。
    各地还根据荒地片小、分散的特点，因地种植。泌阳针对境内山、岭、沟、岗多的特点，开展大种南瓜岭、南瓜沟、南瓜岗，十里长堤南瓜网运动。在规划种植品种时，各地除保证全年有菜吃以外，还大量种植了早熟速生菜。滑县推行了植株高与植株低结合；生长期长与生长期短的结合；根深与根浅结合的栽培法，全县种的菜又多又快又好。种上的十七万多亩春菜，已大部出土。
    据新华社天津30日电　天津市近郊区各人民公社，千方百计增产早春蔬菜。往年惊蛰时，早春菜刚刚下种，而今年这个时候，全市近郊区种下的早春菜四万多亩有的已经出土，播种面积也比去年增加了很多。
    今春，当中共天津市委向近郊广大农民发出“早播种、早下货，缩短蔬菜供应淡季”的号召以后，各公社的干部、老农和技术员，纷纷研究“早”的办法；大家边研究、边行动，加紧整地、送肥、处理籽种，为春菜早下种作好准备。河北区兴淀公社欢坨生产队经技术研究小组进行研究后，使全队一百多亩小水萝卜比去年提早二十六天下了种。现在，有三十亩萝卜苗已经长到二寸高。各公社在播种早春蔬菜中，还做到品种花样多。立春以后，新立村公社顾庄子生产队，就派人到区蔬菜公司、钢厂征求意见，回来以后就立即召开了老农座谈会研究增加蔬菜品种。北仓公社王庄生产队已经试验成功在初春种黄瓜。现在他们种的黄瓜已经出土，开始分枝，生长茁壮。
    在早春蔬菜生产中，各公社、生产队之间还开展了大协作。由于今年不少生产队是第一次大面积的播种早春蔬菜，因此缺少防寒设备和种子，在栽培技术上也缺乏经验。为了克服这些困难，各公社都开展了大协作。兴淀公社大张庄生产队，去年一亩早春菜也没有种，今年他们却要大量种植。南孙庄管理区知道以后，立即抽出四个技术最高的老农，带着籽种来到了大张庄。现在，大张庄已经种上了小白菜、菠菜等九种早春菜五百亩。
