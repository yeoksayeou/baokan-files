Jiangsu's 40 million mu of wheat are growing well, with green wheat seedlings stretching across the province. Green, robust, even, dense, deep-rooted, and balanced growth across large areas are the basic characteristics of Jiangsu's current wheat seedlings. The province's wheat seedlings have generally turned green, about fifteen days earlier than last year. According to recent surveys, Grade Two seedlings account for 31.2%. The old pattern of "small at both ends, large in the middle" has been completely changed, with Grade One seedlings being the most numerous (about 60%), Grade Two seedlings being fewer (about 30%), and Grade Three seedlings being even fewer (about 10%). Moreover, this year's Grade Two seedlings have caught up with last year's Grade One seedlings.

A scene of good seedling vigor, a chorus of praise. Cadres and the masses are all praising the good wheat seedlings this year. Farmers say, "This kind of good seedling vigor is the first in decades," with broad leaves, thick stalks, and a green expanse. Truly, "People have drive, and seedlings show vigor."

This unprecedentedly good situation for the first season of wheat in the 1960s is the result of the province's farmers focusing on wheat management. This year, Jiangsu's wheat regreening management started early. By February 16, the area of wheat fields in the province that had been top-dressed with regreening fertilizer accounted for 65.9% of the sown area, three times more than the top-dressed area in the same period last year. This is conducive to early crop regreening, consolidating winter tillering, and increasing effective tillering in early spring. In the regreening management, all localities especially regard eliminating Grade Three seedlings as a key task. In the Xuzhou area, all communes and teams have established professional teams to eliminate Grade Three seedlings, with a deadline for eliminating them. Various localities have also strengthened the management of remote fields and neglected plots. The measures taken in Taizhou, Taixing, Dongtai, and other counties are: carrying out large-scale collaboration, forming expeditionary corps, and camping in the fields; improving transportation tools, establishing fertilizer depots in the fields, and changing the conditions for fertilizing remote fields; and sending strong cadres to lead backward areas, with a deadline to change the situation.

    江苏麦田一派好苗势
    全省一类苗占60％三类苗只占10％
    本报讯　江苏省四千万亩三麦生长得良好，大江南北的麦苗一片青葱。青、壮、匀、密、扎根深和大面积长势平衡，是江苏全省当前麦苗的基本特点。现在全省麦苗已经普遍返青，这比去年要早十五天左右。据最近的排队统计，二类苗占31．2％；完全改变了往年“两头小，中间大”的老规律，出现了一类苗最多（约占60％），二类苗较少（约占30％），三类苗更少（约占10％）。而且今年二类苗赶上了去年的一类苗。
    一派好苗势，一片赞美声。干部、群众人人争夸今年麦苗好。农民说：“这种好苗势，几十年来第一年”，叶阔秆粗，绿油油一片。真是“人有干劲，苗有旺象”。
    这个六十年代第一季三麦的空前良好的形势，是全省农民大抓三麦管理的结果。今年江苏各地的三麦返青管理抓得早，到2月16日止，全省三麦追施返青肥的面积占播种面积的65．9％，比去年同期的追肥面积增加了三倍。这就有利于作物提早返青，巩固冬前分蘖，增加早春有效分蘖。在返青管理中，各地特别把消灭三类苗作为一项突击任务来抓。徐州专区各个社、队，都成立消灭三类苗的专业队伍，限期消灭三类苗。各地还加强了对远田、死角田的管理，泰州、泰兴、东台等县采取的措施是：开展大协作，成立远征兵团，田头扎营；改进运输工具，建立田头肥库，改变远田施肥的条件；对落后地区，派坚强干部领导，限期改变面貌。　（严锋明）
