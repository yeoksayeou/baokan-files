Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 25th: A rally was held in Havana last night to support the struggle of the people of Panama and Paraguay for freedom and independence. This was the fifth day of activities for the Week of Support for the Latin American People.

    At the rally in support of the Panamanian people held by the National Association of Telecommunications Workers, speakers pointed out that Panama's example shows the piratical behavior of American imperialism in enslaving Latin America.

    Andrés Cantillo, President of the Panamanian Student Union, recounted to the assembly the bloody history of American intervention in Panama, which began as early as the beginning of this century. He pointed out that Panama, which has been invaded and colonized by American imperialism, has also been used to invade other countries.

    Orlando Capriles, a member of the National Executive Committee of the Bolivian Workers' Central Labor Union Federation, said that if necessary, the Latin American people will take up arms with the Panamanian people to drive out the American aggressors.

    A rally in support of the people of Paraguay against the pro-imperialist tyranny of Stroessner was held at the University of Havana. Speakers condemned the repressive activities of the Stroessner dictatorship and its handing over of national wealth to American imperialism, and praised the heroic struggle of Paraguayan fighters for national democratic liberation.

    The Week of Support for the Latin American People has been extended to the whole country. In Santiago, a rally was held on the 22nd, at which representatives of the peoples of Haiti and Puerto Rico, as well as Rebel Army Captain Jorge Risquet, spoke. Similar rallies will also be held in some other cities during the week of support.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: San José dispatch: Some student representatives and university professors in Costa Rica delivered radio speeches on the 25th in support of the Cuban revolution. Student leader Fernando Salazar Navarrete said in a radio speech that the people of Costa Rica are watching the plots being carried out from the outside against the Cuban revolution. They will resolutely support Fidel Castro's revolutionary regime. Carlos Luis Sáenz, a prominent Costa Rican poet and university professor, expressed his full support for the Cuban revolution.
