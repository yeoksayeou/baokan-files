Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 21st: Rain fell in most areas of Gansu Province from March 17th to 19th. This is the first large-scale rainfall in Gansu Province this spring. In the northern parts of Pingliang and Dingxi Prefectures, where the drought situation is more severe, the rainfall was about one to two millimeters; in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture and the southern parts of Dingxi and Pingliang Prefectures, the rainfall was two to five millimeters. In De'uru'bu, the capital of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the rainfall reached 6.7 millimeters.

Although the rainfall area was relatively wide this time, the amount of rain was small and still cannot meet the current agricultural water needs. Commune members in various rainfall areas are currently taking advantage of the favorable opportunity to rush to plant while the soil is still moist, and are harrowing to preserve soil moisture. The people of the province are determined to carry the fight against drought to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 20th: Most areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region welcomed rain and snow from March 18th to 19th. The precipitation ranged from one to six millimeters. This rain and snow has alleviated the drought situation to varying degrees in Inner Mongolia. In some areas, the precipitation was relatively high, creating good conditions for spring plowing and sowing. However, from the perspective of the entire region, due to the prolonged drought and small amount of rain, it is still necessary to step up drought prevention and resistance.

    甘肃、内蒙古普降喜雨
    新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省大部分地区3月17日到19日先后降雨。这是甘肃省今春以来第一次大面积降雨。旱情较重的平凉、定西专区北部等地区，降雨量在一至二毫米左右；临夏回族自治州、定西和平凉专区的南部降雨二至五毫米。甘南藏族自治州首府德乌鲁布降雨达六点七毫米。
    这次降雨地区虽然比较广，但雨量小，仍不能满足当前农业用水需要。各降雨地区社员目前正在利用有利时机趁墒抢种，耙耱保墒。全省人民决心把抗旱斗争进行到底。
    新华社呼和浩特20日电　内蒙古自治区大部地区，从3月18日到19日喜降雨雪。降水量为一至六毫米。这次雨雪使内蒙古各地的旱象有了不同程度的缓和。有些地区降水量较多，给春耕播种创造了良好条件。但从全区来看，由于久旱雨小，仍需加紧防旱抗旱。
