Latin American Literature in China
Wang Yangle

In the past, mentioning Latin American literature would have seemed unfamiliar to everyone. We were also unfamiliar with such a vast land, more than twenty countries, and 180 million people, due to the long-term imperialist aggression. After the founding of New China, the friendship between the people of our country and the people of Latin America has greatly increased. Latin American literature has also become familiar to us due to the increasingly frequent cultural exchanges between the people of our country and the people of Latin America. Famous Latin American revolutionary poets Neruda and Guillén have visited China several times. We also held memorial meetings for José Martí, a world-renowned cultural figure and Cuban democratic revolutionary poet, and Euclides da Cunha, a Brazilian realist writer, in 1953 and 1959 respectively. Newspapers and magazines, especially "World Literature," which introduces foreign literature, also frequently publish novels and poems by writers from various Latin American countries. In the past few years, publishing houses of literary books have made tremendous efforts, starting to systematically introduce and publish excellent classical and modern works of Latin American literature, enabling us to begin to understand the history, life, and struggles of the Latin American people from the reflections in literary works.

Latin American literature has never been valued by Western imperialist countries. They either treat it as an appendage of Spanish and Portuguese literature, or they believe that it does not exist independently and is merely an imitation of French literature. Recently, American imperialists have been dumping so-called "American way of life" culture into Latin America in large quantities, attempting to stifle Latin American national literature. However, Latin American national literature has grown up in the struggle for independence and in the national liberation movement. It has its own tradition and strong combativeness. It has grown stronger in the struggle against reactionary trends such as modernism, surrealism, and new worldism, which serve the interests of the comprador bourgeoisie and the landlord class. The works of many outstanding writers truthfully reflect the face of the Latin American people's national liberation movement.

Currently, the Latin American literary works published in our country basically belong to the three periods of Latin American literature. The first period is the period of the independence war, with revolutionary romanticism as the mainstream literature; the second period is the exposure of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society with critical realism as the mainstream literature; the third period is the literature reflecting the current anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle.

Belonging to the first period are "Selected Poems of Martí" and "Selected Poems of Castro Alves." José Martí was a heroic figure in the Cuban independence revolution, who sacrificed himself in the battle against the Spanish colonial army. His poetry is full of romanticism and is a clarion call for the Latin American people to strive for national independence. Castro Alves was a Brazilian revolutionary poet who vehemently opposed the black slave system in Brazil, and his poems were filled with fiery enthusiasm. In addition, "Peruvian Traditions" by Peruvian writer Ricardo Palma can also be said to belong to this period. Palma was a master of describing the social customs of the Peruvian colonial period. This book selects and translates more than 20 of his unique literary form "traditions," which have a strong national character.

Belonging to the second period, the first to be mentioned should be Brazilian famous writer Euclides da Cunha's masterpiece "Rebellion in the Backlands". This is a soul-stirring work that describes the historical event of the reactionary Brazilian government's brutal suppression of peasant uprisings at the end of the last century. The author sternly condemned the atrocities of the reactionary ruling class. Secondly, there is Colombian writer Eustacio Rivera's famous novel "The Vortex," which profoundly exposes the cruel exploitation of rubber workers by landowners and occupies an important position in Latin American critical realist literature. In addition, "Masters of the Dew" by Haitian revolutionary writer Jacques Roumain is also a masterpiece belonging to this period. Jacques Roumain was one of the founders of the Haitian working-class political party. In this novel, he reflects the struggle of the Haitian peasants. Mexican famous writer José Mancisidor's novel "The Trend of the Wind" reflects an episode of the Mexican democratic revolution. A peasant revolutionary leader who implemented land reform policies is vividly portrayed in the book.

The works reflecting the contemporary struggle of the Latin American people, the third period, have been published the most. The first is Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, whose poems are most familiar to us. We have published a collection of his poems and essays, and his recent work "Grapes and Wind" (selected and translated) has also been published. Another is Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén, whose famous poems, more than 40 of them, are selected and translated in "Selected Poems of Guillén." Argentine writer Alfredo Varela's novel "The Dark River" is one of the outstanding works of Latin American literature in recent years. It describes the slave labor of Argentine mate tea industry workers and their struggles. Brazilian female writer Alina Paim's novel "Time Will Come" depicts a strike struggle by Brazilian railway workers, vividly reflecting the leading role of the Brazilian Communist Party among Brazilian workers. Haitian writer Jacques Stephen Alexis's novel "Compère Général Soleil" describes the poverty and backwardness of Haitian society under the oppression of American imperialism with great length, as well as the vigorous anti-imperialist struggle carried out by the Haitian people under the leadership of the Haitian Communist Party. Costa Rican writer Carlos Luis Fallas's novel "Mamita Yunai" describes the exploitation of the Costa Rican people by the American monopoly enterprise "United Fruit Company," as well as the interference and manipulation of internal affairs. Mexican writer José Mancisidor's last novel, "Dawn Over the Abyss," should also belong to this period. In this novel, the author enthusiastically praises the struggle of former Mexican President Cárdenas, supported by the Mexican working masses, against the American imperialist plunder of oil resources. The crimes of American imperialists in subverting the Guatemalan Arbenz government, which implemented democratic policies, are profoundly exposed in Guatemalan writer Miguel Ángel Asturias's collection of short stories "Week-end in Guatemala." Guyana is still under the direct rule of British, French, and Dutch imperialists. Guyanese young poet Martin Carter's "Poems of Resistance" is a call to resist oppression and enslavement.

The above works can be said to be the fruitful results of the efforts of foreign literature translators and publishing workers in introducing Latin American literature, but compared to our needs, compared to the rich treasure of the entire Latin American literature, it is only a very small part. However, it is reported that Chilean writer Baldomero Lillo's short stories depicting the life of miners, Uruguayan writer Alfredo Gravina's novel "Border of Wind" reflecting the struggle of pastoral workers, Bolivian writer Jesús Lara's novel "Yanakuna" reflecting the struggle of Indians for land, Chilean poet Pablo Neruda's famous collection of poems "Elementary Odes," as well as the novel "Doña Bárbara" (written by Venezuelan writer Rómulo Gallegos) reflecting the cruel exploitation of the large estate system, and "Don Segundo Sombra" (written by Argentine writer Ricardo Güiraldes), a representative work of Latin American national literature, are all being translated, and we will soon see more Latin American literary works.

It's just that we don't have any translations of the literature of the Indian ethnic groups and the literature of the Latin American colonial period. The Indians of Latin America had a high culture before the Spanish invasion, such as the Maya-Quiche people of Central America and the Inca people of South America. Their literary works have also been passed down to the present, such as the famous mythological story of the Maya-Quiche people, "Popol Vuh". In addition, during the Spanish colonial rule, Latin American national literature had begun to sprout and grow. Some famous classical works, such as "El Periquillo Sarniento," "Mexican Countryside," and "Lazarillo de Tormes," should also be translated and introduced. We hope that publishing houses will vigorously introduce them so that we can see the origin and full picture of the development of Latin American literature.

    拉丁美洲文学在中国
    王央乐
    过去，提起拉丁美洲文学，大家会觉得很生疏。对这么一大片土地，二十多个国家，一亿八千万人民，我们也是很陌生的，这是由于长期以来帝国主义侵略所造成的。新中国成立后，我国人民和拉丁美洲人民之间的友谊就有了巨大的增进。拉丁美洲文学，也由于我国人民和拉丁美洲人民间的文化交流日趋频繁而为我们所熟悉。拉丁美洲著名革命诗人聂鲁达和纪廉，都曾几次来我国访问。我们也在1953年和1959年分别举行了世界文化名人、古巴民主革命诗人何塞·马蒂和巴西现实主义作家欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚的纪念会。各报章杂志，特别是介绍外国文学的“世界文学”，也经常刊载拉丁美洲各国作家的小说和诗歌。各文学书籍的出版社，在这几年内更是作了巨大努力，开始有系统地介绍出版拉丁美洲文学的古典和现代的优秀作品，使我们有可能开始从文学作品的反映中去了解拉丁美洲人民的历史、生活和斗争的情况。
    拉丁美洲文学向来不被西方帝国主义国家所重视，他们不是把它作为西班牙、葡萄牙文学的附属部分，就是认为它并不独立存在，只是法国文学的模仿。近来美帝国主义者更向拉丁美洲大量倾销所谓“美国生活方式”的文化，企图扼杀拉丁美洲的民族文学。然而拉丁美洲的民族文学是在独立战争、在民族解放运动的斗争中成长起来的，它具有自己的传统和强烈的战斗性，在和为买办资产阶级、大地主阶级利益服务的现代主义、超现实主义、新世界主义等反动流派的斗争中日益壮大，许多杰出的作家的作品，真实地反映了拉丁美洲人民民族解放运动斗争的面貌。
    目前我国已出版的拉丁美洲文学作品，基本上属于拉丁美洲文学的三个时期。第一个时期是独立战争时期，以革命浪漫主义为主流的文学；第二个时期是暴露半封建半殖民地社会的以批判现实主义为主流的文学；第三个时期是反映当前反帝反殖民主义斗争的文学。
    属于第一个时期的，有《马蒂诗选》和《卡斯特罗·阿尔维斯诗选》。何塞·马蒂是古巴独立革命的英雄人物，他在和西班牙殖民军的战斗中牺牲了。他的诗歌浪漫主义色彩十分浓厚，是拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立的号角。卡斯特罗·阿尔维斯是巴西的革命诗人，他激烈反对巴西的黑人奴隶制度，诗中洋溢着火一般的热情。另外还有秘鲁作家里卡陀·巴尔玛的《秘鲁传说》，也可以说属于这个时期。巴尔玛是描写秘鲁殖民地时期社会风尚的巨匠，这本书选译了他独特的文学形式“传说”二十余篇，具有浓烈的民族色彩。
    属于第二个时期的，首先应该提到巴西著名作家欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚的名著《腹地》，这是一本动人心魄的作品，它描写上世纪末巴西反动政府残酷镇压农民起义的历史事件。作者严正地谴责了反动统治阶级的暴行。其次是哥伦比亚作家欧斯塔西奥·里凡拉的著名小说《草原林莽恶旋风》，这本作品深刻地揭露了大地主对橡胶工人的惨酷剥削行为，在拉丁美洲批判现实主义文学中占有重要地位。另外，海地革命作家雅各·路曼的《统治泉水的人》，也是属于这个时期的巨著。雅各·路曼是海地工人阶级政党的创立人之一，他在这本小说里反映了海地农民的斗争。墨西哥著名作家何塞·曼西西杜尔的小说《风向所趋》，反映了墨西哥民主革命时期的一个插曲，执行土地改革政策的一个农民革命领袖，在书中得到了生动的描写。
    反映当代拉丁美洲人民斗争的第三个时期的作品，出版最多。首先是智利诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达，他的诗歌最为我们所熟悉。我们曾出版了他的一本诗文集，他的近作《葡萄与风》（选译）也已出版。另外是古巴诗人尼古拉斯·纪廉，在《纪廉诗选》中选译了他的著名诗歌四十余首。阿根廷作家阿尔弗雷陀·伐莱拉的小说《阴暗的河流》，是拉丁美洲文学近年来的杰出作品之一。它描写了阿根廷马黛茶业工人的奴隶劳动和他们的斗争。巴西女作家阿琳娜·巴依姆的小说《时候就要到了》，描写巴西铁路工人的一次罢工斗争，生动地反映了巴西共产党在巴西工人中的领导作用。海地作家雅克·斯蒂芬·阿列克西斯的小说《太阳老爷》，以巨大的篇幅描写了在美帝国主义压迫下的海地社会的贫困落后状况，以及海地人民在海地共产党领导下进行轰轰烈烈的反帝斗争。哥斯达黎加作家卡洛斯·路易斯·法雅斯的小说《绿地狱》，描写了美国垄断企业“联合果品公司”对哥斯达黎加人民的剥削，以及对内政的干涉操纵。墨西哥作家何塞·曼西西杜尔的最后一本小说《深渊上的黎明》，也应该属于这个时期，作者在这本小说中，对墨西哥前总统卡德纳斯在墨西哥工人群众支持下反对美帝国主义掠夺石油资源的一场斗争，作了热情的歌颂。美帝国主义者颠覆执行民主政策的危地马拉阿本斯政府的罪行，在危地马拉作家朱盖尔·安海尔·阿斯杜里亚斯的短篇小说集《危地马拉的周末》中有了深刻的揭露。圭亚那现在还处在英、法、荷帝国主义者的直接统治下，圭亚那青年诗人马丁·卡特的《反抗诗集》就是反抗压迫和奴役的呼声。
    以上这些作品，可以说是外国文学翻译工作者和出版工作者在介绍拉丁美洲文学方面的努力成果，但是比起我们的需要，比起整个拉丁美洲文学丰富的宝藏来，还只是极小的一部分。不过，据悉智利作家巴尔多迈洛·利约描写矿工生活的短篇小说，乌拉圭作家阿尔弗雷陀·格拉维那反映牧业工人斗争的小说《风中边界》，玻利维亚作家赫苏斯·拉腊反映印第安人争取土地斗争的小说《雅那库纳》，智利诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达的著名诗集《平凡的歌》，以及反映大庄园制度的残酷剥削的小说《堂娜芭芭拉》（委内瑞拉作家罗慕洛·伽莱古斯著），拉丁美洲民族文学的代表作品《堂塞贡陀·松勃拉》（阿根廷作家里卡陀·纪拉尔台斯著）等，都正在翻译中，我们不久会看到更多的拉丁美洲文学作品。
    只是关于印第安民族的文学和拉丁美洲殖民地时期的文学，我们还没有译作。拉丁美洲的印第安人，在西班牙人入侵之前，就有高度文化，如中美洲的马雅—基切人，南美洲的印卡人。他们的文学作品，也有流传到现在的，如马雅—基切人的著名神话故事《波波尔—乌》。另外，在西班牙殖民者统治时期，拉丁美洲民族文学已开始萌芽成长，有些著名古典作品，如《生疥疮的鹦鹉》、《墨西哥乡村》、《导盲童子》等，也应翻译介绍，我们希望各出版社大力介绍，以便看到拉丁美洲文学发展的源流和全貌。
