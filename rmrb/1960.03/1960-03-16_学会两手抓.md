Currently, the national situation is extremely good. A nationwide upsurge in the technical revolution of mechanization and semi-mechanization is sweeping across the country. Following the culmination of the water conservancy construction upsurge, a new upsurge of spring plowing, spring sowing, and striving for a bumper summer harvest has emerged. The flowers of cultural revolution are also blooming everywhere. The mass movements on both the economic and cultural fronts are in full swing, even broader, more in-depth, and more advanced than the mass movement of large-scale steel production in 1958. People’s mental outlook is also undergoing rapid changes: the communist style that combines daring to think and act with a pragmatic and scientific attitude; the selfless communist attitude of laboring without regard to remuneration; and the communist spirit of cooperation that “offers convenience to others and reserves difficulties for oneself” are being promoted and developed. This is a new characteristic of our country's continued leap forward. Grasping the current excellent situation, guiding it according to circumstances, and adding fuel to the flames to create even greater and better achievements is the current task of leading comrades at all levels.

Being good at utilizing the situation and maximizing the role of subjective and objective conditions is the art of leadership. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War": "The outcome of a war is undoubtedly determined mainly by the military, political, economic, and natural conditions on both sides. However, it is not only that, but also depends on the subjective guiding ability of both sides. Military strategists cannot attempt to win a war beyond the scope permitted by material conditions, but they can and must strive for victory within the scope permitted by material conditions. The stage for the activities of military strategists is built on objective material conditions, but with this stage, military strategists can direct many vivid, colorful, powerful, and magnificent dramas." In this regard, Comrade Mao Zedong is an outstanding example for us to learn from. Currently, various localities are conscientiously studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works. We should learn from Comrade Mao Zedong how to most correctly, thoroughly, and skillfully use dialectical materialism to solve the problems in our country's revolution and construction, so as to gradually improve our leadership level.

Regarding the method of grasping the situation, the great practice of the Great Leap Forward has provided countless examples. As everyone knows, on the eve of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, when the national upsurge of water conservancy construction was unfolding, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the situation at the time, promptly put forward the famous slogans of "hard work for three years," "the first year determines the three years, and the winter before the first year determines the first year," as a method of leadership to promote the Great Leap Forward. That is to say, in order to prepare for the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it was required to make preparations for the next year's production in the winter of the previous year. This leadership method played a huge positive role in our country's Great Leap Forward and became an important weapon for continuous leaps forward in the future. Everyone also knows that industrial production used to be considered a routine to be tight at the end of the year and loose at the beginning, but this year, the industrial production in January and February broke this routine and created a new situation of a good start. This is because the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong proposed in November of last year that while striving to overfulfill the 1959 plan, preparations should be made for the production in the first quarter of 1960, and factories, mines, and railway transportation throughout the country made arrangements accordingly. Facts have proved that the "routine" of being high at the end of the year and low at the beginning did not truly reflect the laws of objective reality, but was a backward ideology that hindered the development of production. We used Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow this backward ideology, and also broke the old routine and established a new routine. The central issue here is that leadership work must grasp with both hands, one hand grasping today and the other grasping tomorrow; one hand grasping the first step and the other grasping the second step. When people walk, they always prepare to take the second step after taking the first step. This is the dialectic of life. The same is true in practical work. Why do some people sometimes get caught up in busy and passive work and cannot handle it with ease? An important reason is that they only care about today and forget about tomorrow. Dialectics requires looking at problems comprehensively and in a connected way. In leadership work, it should be: thinking about the next stage in the previous stage, thinking about the next year in the previous year, thinking about the next quarter in the previous quarter, and thinking about the next month in the previous month. We must grasp early and grasp in detail, so that each step is connected, each link is tightly linked, and we approach the final destination step by step.

Grasping with both hands, one hand grasping current production and the other grasping preparatory work for tomorrow's production, is a concrete application of Mao Zedong Thought in practical work. In dealing with revolution and construction, Comrade Mao Zedong often used the idea of dialectically unifying today and tomorrow to educate the entire Party. During the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed to the entire Party: "To complete the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution (the new democratic revolution) and prepare to transform it into the stage of socialist revolution when all necessary conditions are met, this is the glorious and great entire revolutionary task of the Chinese Communist Party. Every Communist Party member should strive for this and must never give up halfway." Comrade Mao Zedong used this Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution to make ideological preparations for the socialist revolution for the entire Party, which was a victorious guarantee for the smooth transition of our country's revolution from the new democratic revolution to the revolutionary track of socialism. During the revolutionary war period, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly used the dialectically colored saying "foresight brings success, lack of foresight brings failure" to educate the entire Party and the entire army. He said: "Without prior plans and preparations, victory in war cannot be obtained." "Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles without certainty of victory." This is the motto of our Party in leading wars in the past revolutionary war period. This motto can also be applied to the work of socialist construction. To be sure, we must have sufficient preparation. The more sufficient the preparation, the greater the certainty. This is what we have deeply experienced in practical life. The tasks of 1960 are huge, and the subjective and objective conditions are also very favorable. In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national economic plan for the whole year, we must vigorously grasp preparatory work while striving to complete the current production tasks. We must grasp with both hands, not with one hand. We must continuously revolutionize, not stagnate, let alone disconnect.

Now it is the second half of March. The current urgent task is to grasp with one hand the early completion of the first quarter's production plan, and at the same time make full preparations for a greater leap forward in the second quarter. If these two hands are grasped well, we can make a big effort in the second quarter, which has the best conditions of the whole year, and further lay a solid foundation for a greater victory this year in the second quarter.

The two years of the Great Leap Forward, especially the fact that production got off to a good start at the beginning of this year, have given people a profound education. Many comrades have realized the great significance of the idea of grasping with both hands from practice. However, some comrades, either out of blind optimism, think that the conditions are very good and there is no need to grasp more or grasp early, and as a result, they slacken their efforts; or out of empiricism, feel that the current tasks are very tight, and they should complete the tasks first, and it will be too late to make preparations in a temporary sprint, and as a result, they fall into a passive state. The emergence of this situation is caused by ideological problems. Wherever this kind of thinking rears its head, the Party organization must correct it in a timely manner. We must guide everyone to see tomorrow from today, look forward instead of backward. This is the revolutionary characteristic of Communists. Lenin said it well: "Life creates completely new situations for us. One of the main mistakes that revolutionaries often make is to look back and only look at past revolutions. But life provides a lot of new things, and they must be incorporated into the entire chain of events." Lenin said this before the October Revolution. Looking at the boiling life of the whole country now, how many new things do our people provide for their lives every day! These new things represent a great future. We must incorporate the new things of every day into our plans with a high degree of political sensitivity, and not lag behind life. One of the main tasks of current ideological work is to educate the masses with communist ideology, and encourage people to combine today's socialist construction with tomorrow's communist ideals, clearly recognize the future in their daily work, think about the next step while taking this step, and work hard for today and also for tomorrow, diligently and full of lofty aspirations. Only in this way can we avoid growing arrogance and lethargy because of satisfaction with the achievements we have made, and can we enable leading staff to always stand at the forefront of the mass movement, and enable the broad masses to maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and full labor enthusiasm.

After the ideological problem is solved, meticulous organizational work has a decisive significance. Grasping with both hands is of course much more complicated than grasping with one hand. Therefore, there must be meticulous plans and deployments. Comrade Mao Zedong, when talking about organizing military operations, put forward a principle that has universal significance for all work: "There should be the most rigorous plans possible beforehand, which is the prior preparation for all actions. The understanding of the situation, the determination of tasks, the deployment of forces, the implementation of military and political education, the planning of supplies, the sorting out of equipment, the coordination of mass conditions, etc., must all be included in the meticulous consideration, effective execution, and inspection of the degree of execution by the leaders. Without this condition, things like initiative, flexibility, and offense cannot be realized." In order to grasp the complex task of organizing production and sustained leap forward, our plans must be as rigorous as possible, including the main and the secondary, this step and the next step, all aspects before, after, left, and right, and especially pay attention to the weak links. Because, the failure to complete a plan is often caused by neglecting weak links. With good plans and measures, we must grasp the progress. Many factories and mines in Yangquan City proposed "focusing on grasping production in the first and middle ten days of the month, and focusing on grasping preparations in the last ten days of the month." This method is worth referring to. In this way, the completion of the monthly plan is based on the preparatory work in the last ten days of the previous month, and the completion of the monthly plan is guaranteed. Grasping production in the first and middle ten days of the month means completing the main part of the plan in the first and middle ten days of the month, which provides conditions for completing the monthly plan ahead of schedule. If the monthly plan can be completed ahead of schedule in the last ten days of the month, we can increase production beyond the quota on the one hand, and strive for time to do preparatory work on the other hand.

It should be admitted that even the most meticulous plan cannot include all aspects of the problems that may arise in the development of production. This requires timely inspection in the process of implementing the plan, discovering problems, and solving them quickly. Inspection work should also grasp with both hands, both checking the current production situation and checking the preparation for the next step of production. The method of inspection work should be to see both things and people, not only checking production, technology, and materials, but also checking people, checking people's ideological state, people's potential, and the development of the mass movement. The responsibility of leadership work lies not only in formulating the most rigorous plans possible and taking effective measures, but also in promptly discovering factors that were not anticipated in advance or new situations that could not be estimated in advance in the process of implementation, quickly revising the original plan and taking new measures adapted to the changes in the situation, and promoting the mass movement to move forward.

The national leap forward situation is compelling. The new situation puts higher demands on leadership work. With the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, with the increasingly strengthened political and ideological leadership of Party committees at all levels, and with the study of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, as long as we conscientiously sum up experience and apply dialectical materialism to practical work, achieving the dialectical unity of this step and the next step, today and tomorrow, the present and the future, we will be able to further grasp the objective laws of various tasks in the continued leap forward, so as to better exert our subjective initiative and ensure the comprehensive and sustained leap forward on all fronts in 1960.

    学会两手抓
    目前全国形势极好。一个全民大搞机械化半机械化的技术革命浪潮正在席卷全国。水利建设高潮告一段落之后紧接着又出现了春耕、春播和争取夏季大丰收的高潮。文化革命的花朵也到处盛开。经济战线和文化战线的群众运动都是热火朝天，比起1958年大办钢铁的群众运动，现在是更加宽广，更加深入，更加提高了。人们的精神面貌也在飞跃变化，敢想敢干的首创精神和实事求是的科学态度相结合的共产主义风格，不计报酬的忘我的共产主义劳动态度，“把方便送给别人、把困难留给自己”的共产主义协作精神，正在发扬光大。这是我国继续跃进的形势的新特点。抓住当前的大好形势，因势利导，推波助澜，创造更大更好的成就，这是各级领导工作同志的当前任务。
    善于利用形势，最大限度地发挥主观条件和客观条件的作用，这是领导的艺术。毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”中说，“战争的胜负，主要地决定于作战双方的军事、政治、经济、自然诸条件，这是没有问题的。然而不仅仅如此，还决定于作战双方主观指导的能力。军事家不能超过物质条件许可的范围外企图战争的胜利，然而军事家可以而且必须在物质条件许可的范围内争取战争的胜利。军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来。”在这方面，毛泽东同志是我们学习的卓越榜样。现在，各地都在认真学习毛泽东同志的著作。我们应当学习毛泽东同志如何最正确、最彻底、最熟练地运用辩证唯物论来解决我国革命和建设中的问题，以逐步提高自己的领导水平。
    关于抓住形势的方法，大跃进的伟大实践提供了无数的范例。大家知道，在1958年大跃进的前夕，当着全国兴修水利的高潮正在展开的时候，毛泽东同志根据当时形势，及时地提出了“苦战三年”、“三年看头年，头年看前冬”的有名的口号，作为促进大跃进的领导方法。这就是说，为了准备1958年的大跃进，要求在前一年的冬天就为下一年的生产作好准备。这个领导方法对于我国大跃进起了巨大的积极的作用，成为以后不断跃进的一个重要武器。大家又知道，工业生产年终紧、年初松曾经被看作是常规，但是今年1、2月份工业生产都打破了这种常规，创造了开门红的新局面。这是因为党中央和毛泽东同志在去年11月间就提出在努力超额完成1959年的计划同时，为1960年第一季的生产作好准备，而全国厂矿企业和铁路运输都据此作了安排。事实证明，那个年终高、年初低的“常规”并不是真正反映客观实际的规律，而是阻碍生产发展的一种落后的意识形态。我们用毛泽东思想打倒了这种落后的意识形态，也打破了旧常规，建立了新常规。这里中心问题是领导工作上要两手抓，一手抓今天，一手抓明天；一手抓第一步，一手抓第二步。人们走路的时候总是走出第一步就准备着走第二步。这是生活的辩证法。在实际工作上同样也是如此。为什么有些人有时工作陷于忙乱被动，不能得心应手呢？一个重要的原因是只顾今天，忘了明天。辩证法要求全面地联系地看问题。在领导工作上应当是：上一阶段想到下一阶段，上一年想到下一年，上一季想到下一季，上一月想到下一月。要抓的早，抓的细，使之步步衔接，环环扣紧，一步一步地接近最终的目的地。
    两手抓，一手抓当前生产，一手抓为明天生产的准备工作，这是毛泽东思想在实际工作中的具体运用。在处理革命和建设的方面，毛泽东同志经常把今天和明天辩证统一的思想教育全党。在资产阶级民主革命阶段，毛泽东同志就向全党提出：“完成中国资产阶级民主主义的革命（新民主主义的革命），并准备在一切必要条件具备的时候把它转变到社会主义革命的阶段上去，这就是中国共产党光荣的伟大的全部革命任务。每个共产党员都应为此而奋斗，绝对不能半途而废。”毛泽东同志用这个马克思列宁主义的不断革命论给全党作了社会主义革命的思想准备，这对我国革命从新民主主义革命顺利地转上社会主义的革命轨道是一个胜利的保证。在革命战争时期，毛泽东同志一再用“凡事预则立，不预则废”这个富有辩证色彩的名言，来教育全党全军。他说：“没有事先的计划和准备，就不能获得战争的胜利。”“不打无准备的仗，不打无把握的仗。”这是我们党在过去革命战争时期的领导战争的座右铭。这个座右铭同样可以用到社会主义建设的工作中来。要有把握，就要有充分的准备。准备越充分，把握就越大，这是我们在实际生活中深刻体验了的。1960年的任务是巨大的，主客观条件也是十分有利的。为了保证全年国民经济计划的完成和超额完成，就必须在努力完成当前生产任务的同时，大抓准备工作。要两手抓，不要一手抓。要不断革命，不要停滞，更不要脱节。
    现在是3月的下半月了。当前的紧迫任务是一手抓提前完成一季度的生产计划，同时为二季度的更大跃进作充分的准备。这两手抓好了，我们就可以在全年条件最好的第二季度大干一场，在第二季度为今年的更大胜利进一步打下巩固的基础。
    两年的大跃进，特别是今年年初生产开门红的事实，给了人们以深刻的教育。许多同志都从实践中认识到两手抓这个思想的重大意义。但是，也有的同志，或是出于盲目乐观，以为条件很好，不必多抓早抓，结果松了劲；或是出于经验主义，觉得眼前任务很紧，先完成任务再说，准备工作临时突击也来得及，结果陷于被动。这种情况的产生都是思想问题在作怪。凡是有这种思想露头的地方，党的组织都要及时加以纠正。我们一定要引导大家从今天看到明天、向前看而不向后看。这是共产党人的革命特色。列宁说得好：“生活给我们创造了崭新的形势。革命者常犯的一个主要错误，就是往后看，只看过去的革命。可是生活提供了很多的新东西，必须把它们纳入事变的整个链条之中。”列宁这句话是在十月革命以前说的，看看全国现在沸腾的生活，我国人民每天给自己的生活提供多少新的东西啊！这些新事物代表着伟大的未来，我们一定要以高度的政治敏感把每天的新东西纳入我们的计划中，而不要落在生活的后边。当前思想工作的主要任务之一，就是要用共产主义思想教育群众，鼓舞人们把今天的社会主义建设和明天的共产主义理想结合起来，在日常工作中清醒地认清前途，走这一步想到下一步，为今天同时也要为明天，埋头苦干地又是满怀壮志地辛勤工作。只有这样，才能不致因为满足于既得的成就而生长起骄气和暮气，才能使领导工作人员永远站在群众运动的最前面，使广大群众保持旺盛的革命干劲和饱满的劳动热情。
    在思想问题解决之后，周密的组织工作便有了决定的意义。两手抓当然比一手抓要复杂得多，因此，必须有周密的计划和部署。毛泽东同志在谈到组织军事行动时，曾经提出了一个对一切工作都有普遍意义的原则：“事先都应有尽可能的严密计划，这就是一切行动的预先准备工作。情况的了解，任务的确定，兵力的部署，军事和政治教育的实施，给养的筹划，装备的整理，民众条件的配合等等，都要包括在领导者们的过细考虑、切实执行和检查执行程度的工作之中。没有这个条件，什么主动、灵活、进攻等事，都是不能实现的。”为了抓起组织生产持续跃进的复杂任务，我们的计划必须尽可能严密，要包括主要的和次要的、这一步的和下一步的、前后左右的一切方面，特别是要注意薄弱的环节。因为，一个计划的不能完成常常是由于忽视薄弱环节所造成。有了好的计划和措施，就要抓进度。阳泉市的许多厂矿提出“中上旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备”，这个办法值得参考。这样，把月计划的完成放在上月下旬的准备工作基础上，完成全月的计划就有了保证。上中两旬抓生产，就是要在上中两旬内完成计划的主要部分，这样就给提前完成月计划提供了条件。下旬能够提前完成月计划，也就可以一面超额增产，一面争取时间去作准备工作。
    应当承认，即使是最周密的计划，也不可能包括生产发展中可能出现的各个方面的问题。这就需要在执行计划的过程中及时检查，发现问题，迅速解决。检查工作也要两手抓，既检查当前的生产情况，同时也要检查下一步的生产准备情况。检查工作的方法应当是见物又见人，既查生产、查技术、查物资，也检查人、检查人的思想状态、人的潜力、群众运动的发展情况。领导工作的责任，不仅在于制定尽可能周密的计划和采取有效的措施，而且在于在执行过程中及时发现预先没有估计到的因素或者预先无法估计的新情况，迅速修正原来的计划和采取适应于情况变化的新措施，推动群众运动向前发展。
    全国跃进形势逼人。新的情况向领导工作提出更高的要求。有了两年来大跃进的丰富的经验，有了各级党委的日益加强的政治思想的领导，又有了对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志著作的学习，只要我们认真总结经验，把辩证唯物论思想运用到实际工作中去，做到这一步和下一步、今天和明天、现在和将来的辩证统一，我们就能更进一步掌握继续跃进中各项工作的客观规律，从而更好地发挥主观能动作用，保证1960年各个战线的全面的持续的跃进。
