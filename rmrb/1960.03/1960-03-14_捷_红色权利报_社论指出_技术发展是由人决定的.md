The Czech "Red Right Newspaper" editorial pointed out
　　Technical development is determined by people

　　This newspaper reports that the Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" published an editorial on the 4th entitled "Technology is Determined by People."

　　The editorial stated that everyone acknowledges that technological development is a key issue for increasing labor productivity and formulating the Third Five-Year Plan. However, the current experience in drafting the Third Five-Year Plan shows that realizing this universally recognized principle is far from simple. Although technological development occupies a higher position in the draft plan than ever before, it is largely understood in a very one-sided way. For example, in the actual preparation of the plan, enterprise leaders "calculate" how much machinery and equipment can be purchased with the funds within the factory and what technical measures need to be taken. If the targets cannot be achieved, they ask the higher authorities for people and money or lower labor productivity.

　　The editorial pointed out that this approach forgets a most basic fact: technological development is far more than just a technical issue. The level of technology, the speed of development, and its contribution to the development of the national economy are all determined by people—technicians, designers, engineers, innovators, rationalization proposers, and the rest of the workers.

　　The editorial pointed out that the difficulties in technological development during the formulation of the Third Five-Year Plan also arose because technological development was seen as purely a matter for technical personnel. However, the Gottwaldov Precision Machinery Manufacturing Factory relied on the power of the masses to solve this problem. When the factory's technicians, economists, and factory leaders were drafting the tasks for the Third Five-Year Plan, they could not figure out how to improve the labor productivity indicators no matter how hard they tried. The factory leaders did not choose the path of asking the state for machines and money or lowering the targets. Instead, they discussed this issue with the workers. A movement of "everyone striving to reduce difficulties in production" formed in the factory and has achieved success.

　　The editorial said that these experiences prove that the power of the workers' subjective initiative lies first and foremost in its mass character. The hundreds and thousands of small rationalization proposals and opinions of the workers will converge into a torrent that can have a significant impact on the management of the enterprise. The editorial finally emphasized that new technology is not only machines but, first and foremost, people who determine the speed of technological progress with their labor.

### 捷“红色权利报”社论指出　技术发展是由人决定的

    捷“红色权利报”社论指出
  　技术发展是由人决定的
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”4日以“技术是由人来决定的”为题发表社论。
    社论说，谁都承认，技术发展是提高劳动生产率，制定第三个五年计划的关键问题；但编制第三个五年计划的现有经验表明，实现这一人所公认的原则远远不是那么简单的事情。虽然在计划草案中技术发展占有比以往任何时候都高的地位，但大都对技术发展有着非常片面的理解。如在实际编制计划时，企业领导“计算”厂内资金能够购买多少机械设备以及需要采取什么样的技术措施，若指标不能达到时，便向上级要人，要钱，或降低劳动生产率。
    社论指出，这种做法忘记了一个最基本的事实：技术发展远远不单是一个技术性问题，技术的水平，发展速度以及它对国民经济发展的贡献都是由人——技术员、设计员、技师、革新者、合理化建议者和其余的工人来决定的。
    社论指出，在制定第三个五年计划时，在技术发展方面所以产生困难，还因为把技术发展看作纯粹是技术人员的事情，而哥特瓦尔多夫的精密机械制造工厂却依靠了群众的力量解决了这个问题。该厂的技术人员、经济学家、工厂领导在编制第三个五年计划的任务时，无论如何动脑筋也想不出办法提高劳动生产率的指标。该厂的领导没有选择向国家要机器、要钱或降低指标的道路，而是把这一问题同工人们商量，工厂中形成了一个“每人都为减少生产中的困难而努力”的运动，并已取得了成就。
    社论说，这些经验证明，工人主观能动性的力量首先在于它的群众性。工人们的千百个细小的合理化建议和意见会汇合成一股洪流，它能对企业的经营情况发生重大影响。社论最后强调说，新技术不仅是机器，而首先是以自己的劳动决定技术进步速度的人。
