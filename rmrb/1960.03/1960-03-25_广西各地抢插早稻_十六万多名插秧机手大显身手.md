Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 24th:  Most areas of Guangxi have entered the busy season of rice transplanting.  Currently, over 4.7 million mu of early rice have been transplanted throughout the region, 5.3 times more than the same period last year. The transplanting time is a whole season earlier than in previous years.

In the rice transplanting work, Party committees at all levels have adopted various effective measures to strengthen leadership at each level. At the same time, they have mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out technological innovation to improve labor efficiency and ensure the early transplanting season. In the Nanning area, from the regional Party committee to the commune Party committees and the brigade Party branches, secretaries have personally gone to the fields to direct, participate in production with the masses, and provide in-depth guidance to production. In Pingnan County, the five Party secretaries and six committee members of the Liu Chen Commune, along with 244 brigade cadres, while leading production, also cultivated "secretary fields" and cadre experimental plots.  Because the Party committee attached importance and strengthened leadership, the commune completed the task of transplanting 26,000 mu of early rice in just ten days.  Yulin Prefecture has tapped potential in all aspects, concentrating more than 70% of its labor force to participate in transplanting work.  Currently, the prefecture has completed 53.6% of its transplanting plan.

During transplanting, various regions also launched a mass movement for tool reform. At present, more than 159,000 rice transplanters have been rush-produced throughout the autonomous region, and more than 160,000 rice transplanter operators have been trained, playing a huge role in the rush transplanting. In the tool reform in Ningming County, more than 14,000 various carts, more than 2,800 rolling harrows and new-style large harrows were repaired and manufactured. Six hundred and ten rice transplanters were promoted in the county. After using these new-style tools, the transplanting efficiency of the county was increased fivefold compared to the original. Each county in the Yulin Prefecture also has some key points for promoting and trying out rice transplanters. The Mingshan Commune in Yulin County uses rice transplanters, transplanting an average of seven mu per day, with an efficiency more than ten times higher than manual transplanting.

Universally implementing rational close planting is a characteristic of this year's rice transplanting work in various parts of Guangxi. Before transplanting, various regions organized cadres and the masses to summarize the experience of increased production from rational close planting in the past two years. According to local soil and climatic conditions, they formulated various specifications for rational close planting, adapting to local conditions, and according to the paddy fields and plots. At present, the seedlings transplanted in various regions mostly meet the requirements of local rational close planting, generally with more than 200,000 seedlings per mu.

    广西各地抢插早稻
    十六万多名插秧机手大显身手
    新华社南宁24日电　广西大部分地区已进入插秧大忙，全区目前已插早稻四百七十多万亩，比去年同期多五点三倍。插秧时间比往年提早了一个节令。
    在插秧工作中，各地党委都采取各种有效措施，层层加强领导，同时发动群众大搞技术革新，提高劳动效率，保证抢上插秧季节。南宁地区从地委直到公社党委、大队党支部书记，都亲临田头指挥，和群众一道参加生产，深入指导生产。平南县六陈公社五个党委书记、六个委员和二百四十四个大队干部，边领导生产，边搞“书记田”和干部试验田，由于党委重视，领导加强，仅十天就完成了全社二万六千亩早稻插秧任务。玉林专区从各方面大挖潜力，已集中70％以上的劳力参加插秧工作，目前，这个专区的插秧计划已完成了53．6％。
    各地在插秧中，还开展了群众性的工具改革运动。现在，全自治区已赶制插秧机十五万九千多部，并且培训了十六万多名插秧机手，在抢插中发挥了巨大作用。宁明县在工具改革中，共修制各种车子一万四千多架，滚田耙和新式大耙二千八百多把，全县推广插秧机六百一十部，在使用这新式工具后，全县的插秧工效比原来提高了五倍。玉林专区各县也都有一些推广试用插秧机的重点，玉林县名山公社使用插秧机，平均每天插七亩，工效比手插高十几倍。
    普遍进行合理密植，是今年广西各地插秧工作中的一个特点。各地早在插秧前，就组织干部、群众总结了过去两年合理密植的增产经验，并且根据当地的土质、气候等条件，因地制宜、按垌按片的订出了各种合理密植的规格。现在，各地插下的秧苗，大都符合当地合理密植的要求，一般每亩都有苗二十万以上。
