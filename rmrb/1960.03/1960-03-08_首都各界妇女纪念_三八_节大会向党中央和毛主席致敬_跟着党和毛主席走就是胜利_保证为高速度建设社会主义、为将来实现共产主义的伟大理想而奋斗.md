Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The congratulatory telegram from the capital's women from all walks of life commemorating the 50th anniversary of "March 8th" International Women's Day to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The text of the telegram is as follows:

    As we warmly celebrate the 50th anniversary of "March 8th" International Women's Day, as we warmly cheer the great achievements of our country's socialist construction and women's movement, we express our deepest respect to our most beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, representing the sentiments of women across the country, with unparalleled excitement.

    Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and propelled by the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, since 1958, the vast numbers of women in urban and rural areas across the country have universally participated in social labor; collective living welfare undertakings have seen substantial development and improvement, and are developing from the socialization of main household labor to the comprehensive organization of collective life; the vast numbers of women participating in social labor and collective life have greatly enhanced their economic, political, social, and family status, their socialist and communist consciousness has been greatly enhanced, and their mental outlook has undergone significant changes. All this marks that the women's movement in our country has embarked on a new stage of realizing complete liberation.

    We deeply know that all the achievements of the women's movement have come from the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Following the Party and Chairman Mao means victory; Mao Zedong Thought is the truth. We must, under the leadership of the respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold even higher the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes and advance bravely. We guarantee to actively engage in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on the technological revolution and technological innovation; vigorously develop collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings to further realize the socialization of household labor; continue to raise political and ideological awareness, improve technical and cultural levels, and contribute all our strength to realize the continued Great Leap Forward of 1960. Strive to build socialism at high speed and to realize the great ideal of communism in the future.
                                            March 7, 1960

    当我们热烈庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年的时候，当我们热烈欢呼我国社会主义建设和妇女运动所取得的伟大成就的时候，我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，代表全国妇女的心意，向我们最敬爱的党中央和毛主席致最崇高的敬意。
    在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社的推动下，1958年以来，全国城乡广大妇女普遍参加了社会劳动；集体生活福利事业有了大量的发展和提高，并且正在由主要家务劳动社会化向全面组织集体生活发展；广大妇女参加了社会劳动和集体生活，大大地提高了自己的经济、政治、社会以及家庭地位，社会主义、共产主义觉悟有很大提高，精神面貌起了显著变化。这一切标志着我国妇女运动已经走上了实现彻底解放的新阶段。
    我们深知妇女运动的一切成就，都是党中央和毛主席领导得来的。跟着党和毛主席走就是胜利，毛泽东思想就是真理。我们一定要在敬爱的党中央和毛主席的领导下，更高的举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗奋勇前进。我们保证一定积极投入以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动；大办集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，进一步实现家务劳动社会化；继续提高政治思想觉悟，提高技术、文化水平，为实现1960年的继续大跃进贡献出我们的一切力量。为高速度建设社会主义，并为将来实现共产主义的伟大理想而努力奋斗。
                                              1960年3月7日
