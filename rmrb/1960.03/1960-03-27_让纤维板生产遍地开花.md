Let Fiberboard Production Blossom Everywhere

Our country's fiberboard industry has seen rapid development in the past two years. From the emergence of the first batch of domestically produced fiberboard in 1958 to the end of 1959, more than 300 combined native and foreign fiberboard factories across the country had been put into production, with a production capacity of over 130,000 tons. Since the beginning of 1960, fiberboard production has formed a vigorous mass movement in many regions. This year, Fujian Province has successively built more than 200 small fiberboard factories, most of which were started from scratch by the people's communes. At present, our country's fiberboard industry has developed vigorously from points to areas, from cities to rural people's communes, and from forest areas to plains. This marks a new period of great development in our country's fiberboard industry.

The development of the fiberboard industry has enabled us to find new ways to greatly increase timber production: now, not only can forest areas produce timber, but also areas without forests and lacking trees can produce timber. This is a major revolution in the history of forestry development in our country. When people could not produce fiberboard, for thousands of years they always used logs to make various boards, and the utilization rate of a tree only reached about 50%. A large proportion of small-diameter trees, branches, bark, sawdust, etc. were discarded, resulting in great waste. The continuous great leap forward in the national economy and the high-speed development of various construction undertakings require more and more timber. The development and growth of commune-run industries and the improvement of people's cultural and material lives require even more timber. Assuming that each commune builds a 2,000-square-meter factory building and a school that can accommodate 1,500 people, the country would need more than 10 million cubic meters of timber. China is a vast country with a large population. If each person consumes an average of 0.2 cubic meters of timber per year, more than 100 million cubic meters of timber must be produced to meet the needs. In recent years, the development speed of China's forest industry has been very fast, and the increase in timber volume every year has also been very large. However, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and other aspects for timber. In order to solve this problem, forestry production departments have taken measures to vigorously promote the rapid and high-yield growth of trees. Some trees can mature in eight or ten years. This can be regarded as an astonishingly high speed in terms of forestry development. However, this still requires a considerable amount of time to meet the needs of the national economy. We cannot slow down the pace of construction because we are waiting for timber, and we cannot wait until we have timber in eight or ten years to start construction. Precisely because of this, we must vigorously develop the fiberboard industry and widely use various fiberboards to replace timber. Replacing wood with fiberboard is in line with the principle of conservation. One cubic meter of fiberboard can replace 5.7 cubic meters of logs, while producing one cubic meter of fiberboard only requires 3.3 cubic meters of waste materials and scraps. A large amount of residue from timber harvesting and processing, as well as other wild plants, are all raw materials for manufacturing fiberboard and are inexhaustible sources. Recently, many plain areas lacking timber, such as Hebei, Jiangsu, and Henan, have used straw, rice straw, thatch, and other herbaceous and wild plant fibers to produce fiberboard, achieving considerable results and opening up a broad road for the development of China's fiberboard industry.

Vigorously developing fiberboard production should be listed as one of the important contents of commune-run industries. Now, the people's communes are engaged in both industry and agriculture, and are developing all five industries, which provides favorable conditions for the development of fiberboard production. Many people's communes have commune-run forest farms. According to the principle of "adapting to local conditions and using local materials," it is a reliable and effective method to implement fiberboard production in forest farms. Most commune-run forest farms are located near mountains and have forests and grasses, with abundant resources. Generally, commune-run forest farms can engage in diversified operations on a large scale. Combining diversified operations with large-scale fiberboard production in forest farms is not only conducive to the consolidation and development of commune-run forest farms, but also conducive to promoting the development of commune industry, agriculture, and other aspects. Tang County in Hebei Province is a plain area that does not produce timber. In order to solve the problem of self-supplied timber, all ten people's communes in the county have set up fiberboard manufacturing factories. The county does not have a single hot press, and uses baking ovens to vigorously produce fiberboard. This has not only solved the problem of some self-supplied timber, but also transferred a portion to support national construction.

"Using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods" and walking on two legs are the only ways to develop fiberboard production at high speed. Adhering to putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement is the fundamental guarantee for developing the fiberboard industry at high speed. The distinction between indigenous and foreign methods in fiberboard production mainly lies in whether there is a hot press. Having a hot press is considered a foreign method, while using baking ovens is considered an indigenous method. In the spirit of using foreign methods when possible and indigenous methods when foreign methods are not possible, all areas with the conditions should actively develop "small foreign groups" of enterprises to develop fiberboard production. However, since foreign methods of production require certain mechanical equipment and a large amount of investment, if some areas cannot set up small foreign groups of enterprises all at once, they should use indigenous methods and vigorously develop "small indigenous groups" for the fiberboard industry. The equipment and materials needed by various localities to establish "small indigenous groups" of enterprises should be mobilized by the masses to rely on their own efforts. At the same time, they should also give play to the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation and support each other. At present, many regions have already seen "small foreign group" and "small indigenous group" model factories. Giving full play to the role of model factories, disseminating technical experience, and cultivating technical forces are effective ways to further improve the fiberboard industry. Currently, man-made fiberboard products have become one of the products with the largest demand in production and construction. In order to meet the needs of all parties, fiberboard production must blossom everywhere.

    让纤维板生产遍地开花
    我国的纤维板工业近两年来有了飞跃的发展。从1958年第一批国产纤维板出世起，到1959年底止，全国已有三百多座土洋结合的纤维板厂投入生产，生产能力达十三万多吨。进入1960年以来，许多地区纤维板生产已经形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动。福建省今年已经先后建成小型纤维板厂二百多个，其中绝大部分是人民公社白手起家办起来的。目前，我国的纤维板工业，已经由点到面，从城市到农村的人民公社，从林区到平原，蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。这标志着我国的纤维板工业进入大发展的新时期。
    纤维板工业的发展，使我们找到了大量增产木材的新途径：现在，不仅林区能生产木材，无林缺树的地区也能生产木材。这是我国林业发展史上的大革命。当人们不能生产纤维板的时候，几千年来总是利用原木制成各种板材，一棵树的利用率只达到50％左右，一些小径木、枝丫、板皮、锯屑等绝大部分都扔掉了，浪费很大。国民经济的连续大跃进，各项建设事业的高速度发展，对木材的需要量越来越多。社办工业的发展壮大和人民文化物质生活的提高，木材的需要量就更大。假设每个公社建设一座两千平方米的厂房和可以容纳一千五百人的学校，全国就需要一千多万立方米木材。我国是一个地广人多的国家，如果平均每人每年消费木材零点二立方米，就必须生产上亿立方米的木材，才能满足需要。近几年来，我国森林工业的发展速度很快，每年增加木材的幅度也很大，但是，仍不能充分满足工农业生产飞跃发展和其它方面对木材的需要。为了解决这个问题，林业生产部门采取了大搞林木速生丰产的措施，有的树木八年、十年就能成材，这在林业发展方面，可算是惊人的高速度，然而，这对于满足国民经济要求来说，还是需要相当长的时间的。我们不能因为等待木材而放慢建设速度，更不能等十年、八年以后有了木材再来建设。正因如此，我们就必须大力发展纤维板工业，用各种纤维板来广泛代替木材。用纤维板顶替木板是符合节约原则的，一立方米纤维板能顶替五点七立方米原木，而生产一立方米纤维板，只需要三点三立方米废材碎料。木材采伐和加工后的大量剩余物以及其它野生植物，都是制造纤维板的原料，是取之不尽、用之不竭的泉源。最近，河北、江苏、河南等许多缺少木材的平原地区，用麦秆、稻草、茅草等草本和野生植物纤维，生产纤维板，获得不小的成效，为我国纤维板工业的发展开拓了宽广的道路。
    大搞纤维板生产，应当列为社办工业的重要内容之一。现在，人民公社工农并举，五业俱兴，具有发展纤维板生产的有利条件。许多人民公社都有社办林场，根据“因地制宜，就地取材”的原则，把纤维板生产落实到林场，这是一个可靠而有效的办法。社办林场多半靠山，有林有草，资源丰富。一般的社办林场都能够大搞多种经营，而结合多种经营在林场大搞纤维板生产，不仅有利于社办林场的巩固和发展，还有利于促进公社工业、农业和其他方面的发展。河北省唐县是个不产木材的平原地区，为了解决自用材，全县十个人民公社，都办起了纤维板制造厂，全县没有一台热压机，采用烘炉烘烤，大搞纤维板生产，不仅解决了部分自用材，还外调一部分支援国家建设。
    “土法上马、土洋结合”，两条腿走路，是高速度发展纤维板生产的唯一途径。坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，是高速度发展纤维板工业的根本保证。纤维板生产的土洋之分，主要表现在有没有热压机这一工具，有了热压机则为洋，没有热压机采取烘炉的办法则为土。本着能洋则洋，不能洋则土的精神，凡是有条件的地区，都应当积极大搞“小洋群”企业，发展纤维板生产。但是，由于洋法生产需要一定的机械设备和较大数量的投资，某些地区如果不能一下子办小洋群企业，就应该土法上马，大搞纤维板工业的“小土群”。各地建立“小土群”企业所需要的设备和器材，应当发动群众，自力更生，同时也要发挥共产主义大协作的精神，相互支援。现在，许多地区已经出现了“小洋群”和“小土群”标兵厂。充分发挥标兵厂的作用，传播技术经验，培养技术力量，这是进一步提高纤维板工业的有效办法。当前，人造纤维板的产品已经成为生产建设中需要量最大的一种产品，为了满足各方需要，纤维板生产必须遍地开花。
