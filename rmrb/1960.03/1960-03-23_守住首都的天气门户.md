In My Position

    Guarding the Weather Gateway to the Capital
    Zhang Caijuan Huang Wener
    The Xueshan Meteorological Service Station is located on the summit of Xueshan Mountain in Nankou Town, Changping County, northwest of Beijing. The south, west, and north sides are surrounded by overlapping mountains, forming a natural barrier between the capital and the areas beyond the Great Wall. The southeast side is connected to the plains of Beijing, and on clear days, the smokestacks of Beijing's factories can be seen. At the foot of Xueshan Mountain, there are only five or six scattered households. Nankou is seven or eight li to the west, and Changping is eight or nine li to the east. Up here on the mountain top, only the two of us female comrades live, which makes it particularly quiet.
    The climate of Xueshan Mountain has the characteristics of a mountain climate, with warmer winters and cooler summers. However, in winter, when a cold wave passes and the northwest wind blows, the wind force is always about two levels stronger than in the plains, and the strong wind lasts longer. Gales of force eight or nine are common on the mountain, and sometimes there are even force twelve winds. The spring winds are especially well-known. This is the weather route from the northwest to Beijing. In summer, Beijing's rainstorms often invade from the northwest. In winter, the cold currents and severe frosts from beyond the Great Wall also have to pass through the high mountains and steep ridges around Nankou to invade the Beijing area. Therefore, Xueshan Mountain has become the weather gateway to the northwest of the capital. We meteorological observers bear a arduous and glorious responsibility for ensuring the smooth progress of the capital's construction and the bumper harvest of agricultural production.
    Our work is intense and enjoyable. We get up before dawn every morning to listen to the weather forecasts from Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi, and other places, which serve as a reference for us to issue supplementary weather forecasts. From seven o'clock in the morning until one o'clock in the morning, we have to go outside to observe every certain period (sometimes every half hour, three hours, or six hours). When the time comes, no matter whether it is a storm, heavy rain, or severe cold, we have to go out immediately, not even half a minute late. The worse the weather, the more we have to run outside, even several times, to carefully observe the entire evolution of the bad weather and find its pattern.
    When the two of us first came here from school, going out to observe alone at night, when the only few households were already asleep and everything was quiet, the thought that I was the only one outside, what if a wolf came? Then my heart would beat violently. Especially when one person went out for a few days and only one person was left on the mountain top, I was even more afraid. But we couldn't delay the observation because of this! A sense of responsibility strengthened our courage. We also thought that the soldiers on the front lines, in the years of war, lived in the flames of war year after year, but none of them ran back, they all lived and fought bravely. And we, in such a good environment, were still afraid of wolves and tigers, which was really embarrassing. In this way, we were no longer afraid of anything.
    Weather forecasting work serves a wide range of areas, from people's daily lives to major construction projects. If the forecast is wrong, it will cause great losses, so we always pay special attention in our work and try to make the weather forecast more accurate. Whenever we hear news that a unit has avoided losses to state property because of an accurate weather forecast, we feel an unspeakable joy in our hearts, which is better than anything else. But when a forecast is wrong, we feel very heavy, and sometimes we can't even eat.
    The two of us are not only meteorological observers and forecasters, but also cooks, administrators, and purchasing agents. We do everything ourselves in life, such as carrying water up the mountain and going down to Nankou Town or Changping Town to buy oil, salt, firewood, rice, etc., even when there is a strong wind or heavy snow. Although life is hard and work is heavy, we both deeply love this place and live happily. Although we don't usually see movies and don't have holidays, our cultural and recreational life is very rich: we have huqin, harmonicas, flutes, table tennis, badminton, and chess. In addition, we both have good voices. After work, we open our throats and sing to our heart's content, so the quiet Xueshan Mountain seems to be full of life.

### 守住首都的天气门户

    守住首都的天气门户
    张彩娟　黄文儿
    雪山气象服务站在北京西北方，昌平县南口镇雪山山顶上，这里的南、西、北三面山岭重叠，成为首都和塞外的天然屏障；东南面和北京城区相接是平原，天气晴朗时可以看得见北京工厂的大烟囱。雪山脚下稀稀落落地住着五、六户人家。西边离这里七、八里远的地方是南口，东边八、九里路远的地方是昌平，在这山顶上就住着我们两个女同志，显得格外清静。
    雪山的气候具有山地气候的特点，冬暖夏凉，但是冬季当寒潮过后刮西北风时，风力总要比平原地区大两级左右，而且大风持续的时间也较长。八、九级的大风在山上是常有的，有时还出现十二级大风。春天的大风更是出了名。这里是从西北到北京的天气要道；夏天，北京的暴风骤雨，经常是从西北方侵入；冬天，塞外寒流严霜也都要经过南口一带的高山峻岭侵入北京地区；因此，雪山就成了首都西北方的天气门户。在保证首都各项建设的顺利进行和农业生产的大丰收方面，我们气象观测员负有艰巨而又光荣的责任。
    我们的工作是紧张而又愉快的。每天早上天没亮就起来，收听内蒙古、河北、山西等地发来的天气预报，作为我们发布补充天气预报的参考。从早上七点钟开始一直到深夜一点钟，每隔一定时间（有隔半小时的，三小时的，六小时的）就要到室外去观测一次。到时候不管外面是狂风暴雨，还是大雪严寒，马上就得出去，半分钟也不能差，天气越是恶劣，越是要往外跑，甚至要出去好几次，仔细观测坏天气的整个演变过程，找出它的规律。
    当我们两人刚从学校出来到这里时，夜里一个人出去观测，仅有的几户住家也早已入睡了，四周静悄悄的，一想到在外面只有自己一个人，要是来了狼怎么办呢？于是心就突突地跳得厉害。特别是当一个人因事外出几天，山顶上只剩下一个人时，更害怕；但是不能因此耽误了观测呀！一股工作责任心给我们壮大了胆。又想到前线的战士在战争的年代里，长年累月生活在战火中，可是他们没有一个跑回来的，都勇敢地生活着，战斗着；而我们在这样好的环境里，还怕狼怕虎，真叫人害臊。就这样，我们不再害怕什么了。
    天气预报工作服务的面是很广的，小的从人们的日常生活，大的关系到各项生产建设，要是预报搞错了，将会引起很大的损失，所以我们在工作中总是格外注意，尽量把天气预报做得更准确。我们只要听到某单位因为天气预报准确而使国家财产没有受损失的消息，我们的心里真是有一种说不出的高兴，真比什么都美。但是当预报报错了的时候，心情就十分沉重了，有时真是连饭都吃不下去。
    我们两人不但是气象观测员、预报员，而且也是炊事员、管理员、采购员，生活上的一切事情都是自己动手做，如挑水上山，下山到南口镇或昌平镇去买油、盐、柴、米等，刮大风下大雪也不例外。尽管生活是艰苦的，工作是繁重的，但是我们两人都深深地爱上了这个地方，生活得很愉快。平时虽然看不上电影，也没有假日，但是我们的文娱生活内容很丰富：这里有胡琴、口琴、笛子、乒乓球、羽毛球、棋类。此外，我们两个人都有一副好嗓子，工作完了，就拉开嗓门，尽情地歌唱，于是静寂的雪山却显得生气勃勃了。
