　　Gomulka said that the development and work of institutions of higher learning, and the training and cultivation of youth, are matters of great concern to our party, the people's state, and the entire people. The scientific interests of our student youth should be more in line with the spirit of the times and the needs of the country.
　　Speaking about the role of intellectuals in people's lives, he said that the status, role, and significance of intellectuals are even more important in building a socialist society. Therefore, in addition to a high degree of professional proficiency and expertise, socialist intellectuals should have knowledge of social sciences and economics, actively participate in political life, and align their goals and views with those of the working class party.
　　Gomulka said that the necessity of implementing educational reform in institutions of higher learning is fully mature. The essence of this reform lies in better cultivating the ability of college students to engage in professional work and to live in a socialist society. It is necessary to carefully analyze and reconsider the teaching syllabus, and widely implement production internships and participation in production work. This will greatly help cultivate college students to adapt to their future professions and will also have great educational significance.
　　Gomulka emphasized: Educating young people, shaping their character, social stance, and political views—this is the common task of professors, assistant teachers, Party organizations, and youth organizations. Every college student must realize the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Marxist philosophy during their studies at institutions of higher learning, as well as the Marxist doctrine on the laws of social development, that is, to understand the knowledge that forms their scientific worldview and the political, social, and moral outlook of people.
　　The Chairman of the Polish Students' Union, Olszowski, also delivered a report at the meeting.
　　More than 350 delegates attended the congress, as well as delegations from 23 foreign student organizations.

    哥穆尔卡在波兰学生联合会代表大会上说
    知识分子应积极参加政治生活  使自己的观点同党的观点一致
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：波兰学生联合会第四次代表大会27日闭幕。经过四天的讨论之后，大会最后通过了决议，并选出了新的领导机关。
    在大会通过的总决议中指出，最近两年来大学生中的政治情况有了良好的变化，这种情况为培养社会主义知识分子干部的教育工作创造了新的、有利的可能性。决议接着指出，大学生的任务是获取知识，以便更好地为社会服务。为了保证更好地培养出对未来的工作的能力，学生们在学习期间必须获得对生产工作的习惯和经验。
    大会还通过了关于和平和裁军的决议，号召全世界的大学生尽全力作有利于巩固和平、有利于裁军和人民幸福的事情。
    波兰高等教育部部长戈兰斯基在闭幕会上讲话时谈到了教育改革问题。他指出，马克思主义哲学、经济学、社会学和美学都将列入高等学校的教学大纲中。
    大会还致电古巴总理卡斯特罗，表示支持古巴的革命。
    波兰学生联合会第四次代表大会是24日在华沙开幕的。
    波兰统一工人党领导人哥穆尔卡、西伦凯维兹、奥哈布等人出席了第一天的会议。哥穆尔卡并且在大会上讲了话。
    哥穆尔卡说，高等学校的发展和工作，青年的训练和培养，是我们党、人民国家和全体人民非常关心的对象。我们学生青年的科学兴趣应当更符合时代的精神和国家的需要。
    他谈到知识分子在人民生活中所起的作用时说，知识分子的地位、作用和意义在建设社会主义的社会中更加重要。因此，除了高度的业务熟练程度和专业知识之外，社会主义的知识分子应当具有社会科学和经济科学方面的知识，积极参加政治生活，使自己的目的和观点同工人阶级政党的目的和观点相一致。
    哥穆尔卡说，在高等学校实行教育改革的必要性已经完全成熟了。这个改革的实质在于更好地培养大学生具有从事专业工作的能力和在社会主义社会中生活的能力。必须细心分析和重新考虑教学大纲，广泛地实行生产实习和参加生产工作，这样，会在很大程度上有助于培养大学生适应他们未来的职业。而这同样有巨大的教育意义。
    哥穆尔卡强调说：教育青年，形成他们的性格、社会立场和政治观点——这是教授、助教、党组织和青年组织的共同任务。必须使每个大学生在高等学校学习期间认识到马克思列宁主义、马克思主义哲学的根本原则，马克思主义关于社会发展规律的学说，也就是使他们了解形成他们科学的世界观以及形成人的政治、社会、道德面貌的知识。
    波兰学生联合会主席奥尔绍夫斯基也在会上作了报告。
    出席这次大会的有三百五十多位代表，以及二十三个外国学生组织的代表团。
