Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 23rd: Despite the authorities' brutal and bloody suppression, South African Africans continue to launch struggles against the "Pass Laws" in various ways throughout the country.

    On the 22nd, in Vereeniging in Transvaal Province and the Langa area near Cape Town, Africans risked their lives to write slogans on walls such as "Freedom," "Down with the Pass Laws," "Demand a Minimum Wage," and "Equal Pay for Equal Work." In Vereeniging and nearby Vanderbijlpark, Africans held strikes to protest the atrocities of the colonial military police and the white authorities' policies of racial discrimination. It is estimated that a total of 30,000 to 40,000 Africans in these two areas did not go to work that day.
    On the same day, African workers in Cape Town also launched a strike. According to reports, 80% of African workers there stopped working. When a white official from the city's municipal council went to Langa, a nearby African township, the residents angrily told him to get out.
    According to Western news agencies, in Sharpeville, which suffered a government military police massacre on the 21st, extremely angry Africans could be heard everywhere saying, "We want to fight."
    The Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa issued a statement on the 22nd condemning the government authorities for massacring African people and expressing its determination to persist in the struggle against racial discrimination.
    The statement said that this shooting of unarmed Africans proves that the Union of South Africa is a police state, and the white government must be held responsible for this massacre.
    The statement pointed out, "Justice is on our side, and we are ready to pay the highest price at any time. No force can stop us from embarking on the path we have chosen until the cause of Africa is victorious. Our cause must be victorious. As long as there is one African man alive, the struggle must continue."
    The African National Congress of South Africa also protested against the authorities' atrocities.
    At the same time, regardless of the unanimous condemnation and protests from Africans and world public opinion, the authorities of the Union of South Africa brazenly continued to dispatch large numbers of military police yesterday to brutally suppress and arrest Africans who opposed the "Pass Laws."
    In Langa and other places, military police once again opened fire on demonstrating Africans. According to reports, a total of eighty-two Africans have been killed in the two days up to the 22nd. The military police also carried out mass arrests of Africans in various places. On the 22nd alone, one hundred and forty-seven Africans were arrested in Langa and Johannesburg.
    In Langa, Sharpeville, Vereeniging, Johannesburg, and Cape Town, armored vehicles and transport vehicles filled with troops are patrolling the streets, and fully armed police with submachine guns and bayoneted rifles are everywhere. According to Western news agencies, areas such as Vereeniging and Langa have become "armed barracks."

    血腥屠杀扑不灭反对种族歧视的怒火
    南非人民说：我们要战斗！
    新华社23日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲人不顾当局残暴的血腥镇压，继续在各地用各种方式展开反对“通行证法”的斗争。
    22日，在德兰斯瓦尔州的未里尼琴和开普敦附近的兰加地区，非洲人冒着生命危险在墙上写了“自由”、“打倒通行证法”、“要求规定最低工资”、“同工同酬”等标语。在未里尼琴和附近的范德比尔公园，非洲人举行罢工抗议殖民军警的暴行和白人当局的种族歧视政策。据估计，这两个地区在这一天共有三万到四万非洲人没有去上工。
    同一天，在开普敦，非洲工人也展开了罢工斗争。据报道，那里有80％的非洲工人停止工作。当这个市的市政委员会的一个白人官员到附近的非洲人市镇兰加去时，那里的居民愤怒地要他滚出去。
    据西方通讯社报道，在21日曾遭到政府军警大屠杀的沙佩维尔，到处可以听到极端愤怒的非洲人在说：“我们要战斗”。
    南非泛非主义者大会在22日发表声明，谴责政府当局屠杀非洲人民，并表示决心坚持反对种族歧视的斗争。
    声明说，这次向手无寸铁的非洲人开枪屠杀，证明了南非联邦是一个警察国家，白人政府应对这次屠杀的行动负责。
    声明指出，“正义是在我们这一方面，我们已准备好随时付出最高的代价，没有任何力量能够阻止我们走上已经选择的道路，直到非洲的事业获得胜利时为止。我们的事业必然要获得胜利的。只要还有一个非洲男人活着，斗争就必须继续下去。”
    南非非洲人国民大会也对当局的暴行表示抗议。
    同时，南非联邦当局不顾非洲人和全世界舆论的一致谴责和抗议，昨天悍然继续出动大批军警野蛮镇压和逮捕反对“通行证法”的非洲人。
    在兰加等地，军警再度向示威的非洲人开了枪。据报道，在截至22日为止的两天中，共有八十二名非洲人被打死。军警还在各地大肆逮捕非洲人，仅在22日这一天，在兰加和约翰内斯堡等地就逮捕了一百四十七名非洲人。
    在兰加、沙佩维尔、未里尼琴、约翰内斯堡和开普敦等地，到处有装甲车和装满军队的运输车在街头巡逻放哨，拿着手提机关枪和上了刺刀的步枪的全副武装的警察。据西方通讯社报道，米里尼琴和兰加等地区已经变成了“武装兵营”。
