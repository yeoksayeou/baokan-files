    摩洛哥政府决定
    一年内重建阿加迪城
    据估计地震死难者约万人
    新华社拉巴特5日电　摩洛哥宫廷今天下午宣布，内阁在4日晚上举行的一次特别会议上已经决定在一年之内重建被大地震破坏的阿加迪城。会议责成大臣们拟订关于重建阿加迪城的计划。
    负责全盘救援工作的哈桑王储说，阿加迪城由于地震的死亡人数现在已达四千人。他说，已经掩埋了四千具左右的尸体，二千名受伤者已被抢救出瓦砾堆。人们认为，死亡人数可能达到一万人。
    救援人员正在阿加迪城忙着挖掘瓦砾场。4日夜间，又发生一次轻微地震，但是没有造成损失。
    社会主义国家、阿拉伯国家和非洲国家政府纷纷发电报给摩洛哥政府，表示慰问和哀悼。有些国家还向摩洛哥提供救济金和救济品。阿加迪人口约有五万，其中有一万二千名欧洲人。这个城市被认为有希望成为一个迅速发展的港口，最近兴办了一些工业。在3月1日发生的大地震使这个城市90％的老穆斯林居民区、70％的新居民区和35％的工业区被震毁。
