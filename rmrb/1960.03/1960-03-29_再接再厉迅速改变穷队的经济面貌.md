    Keep Up Efforts to Quickly Change the Economic Face of Poor Teams
    Huang Yan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The people's communes possess unparalleled superiority and infinite power, which is already evident in all aspects of production and construction. From the rapid development of production in the "poor teams" of Anhui, this is also very clear. After more than a year of effort, more than half of the "poor teams" in Anhui Province have caught up with the production and income levels of the local rich or average teams.

    Today's people's communes still have a small number of "poor teams" whose production development is relatively slow. The so-called "poor teams" are compared with the rich teams that have good natural conditions and rapid production development. The so-called "poverty" and "wealth" of today are essentially different from the poverty and wealth before liberation. From today's perspective, with the realization of cooperativization and communization, the economic face of poor and rich teams is also very different from the early days of liberation. For example, the Cao Lake Brigade of the Sanba Commune in Su County has increased its grain yield per unit area by more than six times compared to the early days of liberation, but it is still nearly half lower than the Sanba Brigade of the commune. Most of these "poor teams" are located in barren mountainous areas, hills, and lake depressions, where droughts and floods are more frequent. Most of the land is yellow sticky soil, black granular soil, yellow ridges, and alkali sand, and the land is sparsely populated, with a shortage of labor and livestock. Generally, each laborer has to bear the task of cultivating about thirty mu. Therefore, the masses describe these places as: "Bald mountain tops, old alkali gourds, only planting seeds, no seedlings emerge," "A toad sprinkles a pee, drowning a large area, no rain for three days, drought makes smoke." In the period of agricultural cooperatives, although the production level and the living standards of the members of these "poor teams" have been greatly improved, and many poor teams have caught up with the level of rich teams, limited by the small organizational scale and weak economic strength, they could not quickly and fundamentally change the face of poverty. Only after the people's communes were established did a broad path for the rapid development of production in "poor teams" open up.

    Rapidly changing the impoverished face of "poor teams" is not only the common long-term aspiration of cadres and members of "poor teams," but also an important condition for consolidating and developing the people's communes. In order to do this work well, since last year, the leading organs at all levels in Anhui Province, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions, have sent a large number of cadres to universally strengthen the leadership of the work of "poor teams." In March last year, at the Six-Level Cadre Conference convened by the Provincial Party Committee, the relevant policies and steps for leading and helping poor teams to quickly catch up with rich teams were specifically discussed, calling on all "poor teams" in the province to catch up with or exceed the rich teams within two to three years. Subsequently, at the Five-Level Cadre Conference held in each county, the development plans of "poor teams" and the measures for turning from poverty to wealth were specifically studied. The people's communes in various places have fully exerted the superiority of "large scale and high degree of public ownership," and have given great support to the poor teams in terms of financial, material, and human resources. All of these have greatly encouraged the cadres and members of the "poor teams," who are determined to rely on their own efforts to catch up with or exceed the rich teams. From this time on, a competition movement of "poor teams" catching up with rich teams was launched throughout the province. By the end of last year, among the three thousand one hundred and fifty "poor teams" in the province (accounting for 26% of the total number of basic accounting units), five hundred and fifty-four teams had caught up with the level of rich teams, and the total output value generally increased by about one time compared with 1958; one thousand and eighty-two teams had caught up with the level of average teams, and the total output value also increased by more than 60% compared with 1958. Many places that used to be poor mountains and bad waters, with nine years of crop failure out of ten, have now become lands of fish and rice with simultaneous development of five industries, thriving livestock, crisscrossing river networks, and connected rice paddies. In the year of a drought not seen in a century, the increase in production was 60% or even more than one time, and no one can deny that this is an extremely huge change. The production development of poor teams is not only conducive to the realization of the overall leap forward in commune production, but also prepares extremely favorable conditions for accelerating the transition from the basic team ownership to the basic commune ownership.

    The practice of many "poor teams" catching up with rich teams in one year proves that "poor teams" can rely on their own efforts to get rid of their current relatively difficult situation. This is because: "Poor teams" have huge production potential, the members have a high degree of ambition to overcome difficulties, plus the support of the state and the care of the communes, it will not take long, at most two or three years, to turn around and catch up with or even exceed the production and income levels of the rich teams.

    The key for "poor teams" to catch up with rich teams lies in strengthening the Party's leadership over the work of "poor teams." After communization, in addition to conducting a comprehensive survey and making specific plans, the county party committees in various counties sent a large number of cadres to the poor teams to help with work, or to serve as leading positions in the "poor teams" on a permanent basis, to strengthen the leadership core of the "poor teams." Some adopted the method of county party secretaries and ministers sitting in charge of specific points, with quarterly evaluations and inspections. Some counties adopted the method of ministers, section chiefs, and bureau chiefs directly serving as the party branch secretaries of the brigades. Some counties adopted the method of county-level agencies dividing up and taking charge. Some counties also adopted the method of running party schools in the poor teams, rooting locally, and strengthening education. After adopting these methods, the weak leadership status of some poor teams was directly changed, ensuring that the work of "poor teams" catching up with rich teams was rapidly carried out. Su County originally had seventy-six "poor teams." Because more than seventy cadres equivalent to members of the county party committee were sent to the poor teams to sit in charge of specific points, sixty-two poor teams caught up with the level of rich or average teams within one year. From this, it can be seen that strengthening the Party's leadership over the work of "poor teams" is an important guarantee for "poor teams" to catch up with rich teams.

    In order to enable "poor teams" to quickly catch up with rich teams, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, establish lofty ambitions, and adhere to the principle of self-reliance. Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "Materialist dialectics considers external causes as the conditions of change, internal causes as the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes." Facts prove that only by relying on their own efforts and giving full play to subjective initiative can poor teams fully tap the production potential of their own teams and quickly realize the desire to turn from poverty to wealth. Take the Dongkazi Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Wuhe County as an example. This production team was the poorest team, and some wealthy peasants in neighboring teams often ridiculed them, saying that "the poverty emanating from them is overwhelming, and whoever gets contaminated by it will be ruined." However, the Dongkazi Team countered these cynical remarks with practical actions. With the support of the commune Party committee, they often used the slogan "Poor land but not poor in spirit, hard work is the treasure; not eating steamed buns to compete for pride, not catching up with rich teams, vowing to never give up" to encourage the members' ambition of self-reliance. Every household made a determination, and everyone cheered with enthusiasm. As a result, in just one year, the average income per person increased more than five times, exceeding the level of the rich team in the commune. There are many such examples, which vividly illustrate that as long as the masses are fully mobilized and lofty ambitions are established, we will gain the strength to overcome all difficulties. However, when the movement of "poor teams" catching up with rich teams had just begun, some comrades only saw the difficulties such as the poor foundation, thin base, and insufficient manpower and material resources of the "poor teams," but did not see the incomparably powerful power of the people's communes, did not see the infinite production potential of the "poor teams," and did not see that under the encouragement of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of members had a strong desire to quickly change the face of poverty. Therefore, there were feelings of fear of difficulties and lack of confidence. Among a small number of members, although there was an urgent need to turn from poverty to wealth, because they had been restricted by natural conditions for a long time, they did not dare to believe that they had the strength to overcome difficulties, and there was a mentality of simply relying on state relief and commune support. They said: "Sparrows cannot fly alongside geese, how can poor teams catch up with rich teams." Obviously, if this kind of thinking is not resolved, it will not be possible to establish confidence in turning from poverty to wealth among the masses. The main method we used to solve this kind of thinking was to universally carry out a large-scale debate centered on "Can we catch up with rich teams, and how can we catch up with rich teams" with the people's commune as the unit. Through debate, a large number of facts about turning from poverty to wealth were presented, models of turning from poverty to wealth were established at all levels, and experiences in turning from poverty to wealth were summarized. And the members of the "poor teams" were mobilized to offer suggestions and ideas, find reasons, find methods, and formulate plans for turning from poverty to wealth. Facts have proven that wherever the debate is thorough, the confidence of the masses is very high, and the enthusiasm is also greatest. Because the process of debate is also the process of understanding the objective, and by grasping the essence of objective things, one will naturally find the steps and methods for transforming the objective. Therefore, after the debate, the vast majority of cadres and members overcame their feelings of fear of difficulties and dependency thinking. Their conclusion was: "Rivers can be changed, mountains can be moved, and 'poor teams' can definitely catch up with rich teams." Some places also organized members of "poor teams" to visit the advanced experiences of units that had already turned from poverty to wealth, and the effect was even more significant. It was generally believed that "Poverty is not fate, wealth is not innate, as long as you work hard, gold will be found everywhere." They all expressed that they would catch up with the production and income levels of the rich teams within one year or two to three years.

    From the perspective of the "poor teams" themselves, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of self-reliance, but in order to enable the "poor teams" to quickly catch up with the rich teams, the care of the communes and the support of the state are also absolutely necessary. Since the establishment of the people's communes, the broad masses of members have been educated by the General Line, their ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and the communist style has been greatly promoted. In order to achieve the goal of common prosperity, they have supported the "poor teams" in all aspects. The methods used by the people's communes in various places to support the "poor teams" are numerous, such as providing support in terms of materials, helping in basic construction, and providing care in the arrangement of production and planting of crops. Many communes also adopted the method of reducing the withdrawal of public accumulation funds to provide care, and tried to meet the requirements of the "poor teams" in the use of tractors, large agricultural implements, and new agricultural implements. In addition to actively participating in the large-scale labor cooperation organized within the entire commune, many rich teams also voluntarily provided funds and labor to support the basic construction and drought resistance struggle of the "poor teams." During the summer harvest, summer planting, and drought resistance struggle last year, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on urban cadres and masses to go to the countryside to support agricultural production and help "poor teams" catch up with rich teams. This call was quickly responded to by the broad masses of cadres and people, and a total of more than one million cadres, workers, and urban residents participated in this rural support for agricultural production. Most of them were assigned to the "poor teams" to participate in two to three months of labor, which not only powerfully supported the production of the poor teams, but also greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the cadres and members of the "poor teams," and further strengthened the relationship between workers and peasants, the relationship between urban and rural areas, which played a great role in training cadres and further improving the ideological awareness of urban people. In 1959, the state also successively provided 50 million yuan in funds to unconditionally support the "poor teams." All of these have played a great role in the rapid change in the face of the "poor teams."

    In order to enable "poor teams" to quickly catch up with rich teams, it is necessary to implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link." The sign that "poor teams" have caught up with rich teams is that they have caught up with or exceeded the average level of the rich teams in the commune in the current year in terms of grain, cash crops, and sideline production, especially grain, which must at least be self-sufficient with a surplus, and must be consolidated and adhered to, and be able to withstand the test of natural disasters, and be able to overcome even major disasters. In order to achieve this requirement, in the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" and the continued promotion of the "Three Reforms" method, we mainly grasped the three major links of vigorously carrying out farmland capital construction, vigorously developing diversified operations, and vigorously carrying out tool reform.

    Vigorously carrying out farmland capital construction, that is, vigorously carrying out river network construction and water conservancy, and vigorously carrying out soil improvement. This is a fundamental measure to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing agricultural production, and thoroughly changing the face of "poor teams." Water conservancy construction is the central link of farmland capital construction. One of the most important reasons why many "poor teams" caught up with rich teams within one year in 1959 was that they gave full play to the soaring enthusiasm of the masses and vigorously built water conservancy and vigorously carried out soil improvement with the strong support of the people's communes. The Dazhuang Brigade of the Haocheng Commune in Wuhe County, after several years of harnessing the Huai River and building water conservancy, although it has changed the face of "heavy rain causes major disasters, light rain causes minor disasters, no rain causes drought disasters," the water disaster has not been completely eradicated, and it still suffers from different degrees of drought and flood disasters every year, and production is very unstable. After the commune was established, it received the support of the commune and worked hard for a winter and a spring, so that within the entire team, a total of 331,100 cubic meters of earth and stone were made, more than 160 large and small ditches were excavated, and more than 80 wells were dug, basically realizing the river network. Therefore, although there was a major drought of more than 80 days without rain last summer, it still guaranteed a sufficient water source, and the yield per mu increased by 53% compared with 1958, and the entire brigade had an average of more than 1,300 jin of grain per person. The masses sang: "In the past, the water could not be drained, now there is endless food to eat, the barren lake land for many years, now there are rice flowers everywhere, thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership, the poor lake depression has also become paradise." The Dongfanghong People's Commune in Huangkou, Xiao County, is an area of ​​alkali sand and easy drought and flood. Among the 155,000 mu of land, alkali land accounts for 50%, and sandy land accounts for 45%. Although fertilizers have been applied every year since liberation, production still cannot be increased quickly. After communization, they organized large-scale labor cooperation throughout the commune, tapping labor potential in all aspects, and adopting effective measures such as turning over alkali soil, padding fertilizer soil, controlling runoff, and changing to rice planting, overcoming numerous difficulties, and improving the soil. According to the masses' own words, it is called "a major revolution in soil." Therefore, the output of grain and cotton in the entire commune has increased by more than 50% compared with 1958. Due to the comprehensive improvement of the soil, four of the five original poor teams in the entire commune have now caught up with the production level of the rich teams. These facts further illustrate that as long as the subjective initiative of the broad masses is fully exerted and the positive factors in all aspects are fully mobilized, natural conditions can be changed.

    Vigorously developing diversified operations is also an effective measure to quickly change the face of "poor teams." The reason why the production of "poor teams" has not caught up with rich teams is also due to the small number of production channels, the simple business projects, and only relying on some grain income every year, and the output is not high and the income is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to develop diversified economic production, especially to vigorously develop the production of raising pigs and sheep, which requires less effort and yields quick results. Raising pigs can both increase fertilizer, promote crop production, and quickly increase the cash income of "poor teams." The Zhanglou Brigade in Jiangzhai Commune, Linquan County, was mainly poor because diversified operations were not developed. In 1958, the income from diversified operations only accounted for 12.1% of the total income. Last year, in addition to the commune assigning them to grow more cash crops, they also vigorously developed animal husbandry production. Especially developed the pig-raising business. They adopted the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, "seeing a sow must be kept, keeping first and then selecting," and last year the entire brigade kept a total of 442 sows, and promoted the method of hot mating and double mating, which improved the reproduction rate. In 1959, the number of pigs raised in the entire team increased more than three times compared with 1958, the number of sheep raised also increased more than three times compared with 1958, and the number of various poultry increased four times compared with 1958. They caught up with the income level of the rich teams in one year. Therefore, in the development process of the production of "poor teams," it is necessary to vigorously grasp grain crops, but also vigorously grasp cash crops, grasp agricultural production, and also grasp sideline production, so that production can be comprehensively developed.

    Vigorously carrying out tool reform and continuously improving labor efficiency is another important key to ensuring the rapid development of production in "poor teams." As mentioned earlier, "poor teams" are very short of labor. This is a fundamental difficulty in the production of "poor teams"; but in the process of catching up with rich teams, it is bound to complete a larger production task than rich teams, to vigorously build water conservancy, to vigorously carry out soil improvement, and to vigorously develop diversified operations, all of which must pay out more labor. Therefore, the contradiction of insufficient labor has become the main contradiction in the current production of "poor teams." The Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have paid great attention to this issue in leading the movement of "poor teams" catching up with rich teams, and have universally carried out a high-efficiency movement centered on tool reform. This plays an extremely important role in tapping the labor potential of "poor teams" and ensuring the completion of various production and construction plans. According to the production arrangement at the beginning of last year, the Caohu Brigade of the Sanba Commune in Su County lacked a total of 84,585 workdays throughout the year, which was more than one-fifth different from the workdays that needed to be attended, and even more during the busy farming season. In order to solve this problem, the Party branch decided to vigorously carry out tool reform and a high-efficiency movement; in the movement, through methods such as accounting, debate, and visiting rich teams, the members were called upon to overcome conservative thinking, break superstitions, and achieve "everyone using their brains, and everyone having creativity." Due to the mobilization of the masses, the entire brigade put forward 600 rationalization proposals in one year, and improved and created 2,461 pieces of agricultural implements and tools, and most of the required materials were also raised and solved by the masses themselves. Through tool reform, the work efficiency of the entire team in water management, water lifting, cultivation, fertilizer transportation, pig raising, and vegetable cutting has generally increased by 30% to several times, and some have increased by dozens of times, which not only solved the difficulty of insufficient labor, but also freed up 120 laborers to participate in pig raising, fertilizer accumulation, and wasteland reclamation production.

    In the past year or so, more than half of the "poor teams" have caught up with rich teams or average teams, and have achieved great results. However, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and we should also see that: although the economic income of some production teams in 1959 has caught up, grain production has not yet caught up, drought and flood disasters have not been eradicated, and production is not stable. Therefore, we must continue to work hard, conquer nature, and comprehensively catch up with the rich teams. At present, there are still some "poor teams" that have not caught up with the rich teams, and we must work harder, continue to carry forward the ambition of the members to overcome difficulties, be unyielding, and make persistent efforts. The people's communes in various parts of Anhui are further strengthening the leadership of the work of "poor teams" based on the experience of "poor teams" catching up with rich teams in the past year or so, giving full play to the powerful power of the people's communes, giving "poor teams" more support, and striving to change the economic face of all "poor teams" as soon as possible.

    再接再厉迅速改变穷队的经济面貌
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　黄岩
    人民公社具有无比的优越性和无穷的威力，这已十分明显地表现在生产建设的各个方面。从安徽“穷队”生产的迅速发展情况，也同样看得十分清楚。经过一年多的努力，安徽省已经有半数以上的“穷队”赶上了当地富队或一般队的生产水平和收入水平。
    现在的人民公社，还有少数生产发展比较缓慢的“穷队”。所谓“穷队”，是与自然条件好、生产发展快的富队比较而言的。今天的所谓“穷”与“富”，与解放前的穷与富有本质上的不同，从现在来说，随着合作化和公社化的实现，穷队和富队的经济面貌和解放初期也有很大的不同了。如宿县三八公社曹湖大队，粮食单位面积产量比解放初期已经提高了六倍多，但比起本社的三八大队却又低了将近一半。这些“穷队”大都处于贫瘠山区、丘陵和湖洼地带，旱涝灾害较多，大部分土地都是黄粘土、黑粒土、黄岗和砂碱，而且地广人稀，劳动力、畜力都很缺乏，一般的，每个劳动力要担负三十亩左右的耕作任务。所以群众形容这些地方是：“秃山头，老碱瓢，光下种，不出苗”，“蛤蟆撒泡尿，淹死一大片，三日不下雨，旱得直冒烟。”在农业社时期，这些“穷队”的生产水平和社员生活水平虽然都有很大提高，并有不少穷队已经赶上富队水平，但就整个来说，限于组织规模小，经济力量薄弱，还不能迅速从根本上改变贫困面貌。只有在人民公社化以后，才为“穷队”生产的迅速发展开辟了广阔道路。
    迅速改变“穷队”的贫困面貌，不仅是“穷队”干部、社员长期以来的共同愿望，而且也是巩固和发展人民公社的一个重要条件。为了做好这个工作，从去年以来，安徽省各级领导机关，根据中央指示精神，派出大批干部，普遍加强了“穷队”工作的领导。去年3月，在省委召开的六级干部会议上，专门讨论了领导和帮助穷队迅速赶上富队的有关政策和步骤，号召全省所有“穷队”在两三年内赶上以至超过富队。随后，在各县召开的五级干部大会上，又具体地研究了“穷队”的发展规划和由穷变富的措施。各地人民公社充分发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，在财力、物力、人力上给穷队以很大的支持。所有这些，都极大地鼓舞了“穷队”的干部和社员，他们决心依靠自己的努力，赶上或超过富队。从这时起，便在全省范围内开展了“穷队”赶富队的竞赛运动，到去年年底，在全省的三千一百五十个“穷队”（占基本核算单位总数的26％）中，已经有五百五十四个队赶上了富队的水平，总产值一般都比1958年增长一倍左右；有一千零八十二个队赶上了一般队的水平，总产值也都比1958年增长60％以上。许多过去是穷山恶水、十年九歉的地方，如今已变成五业并举、六畜兴旺、河网纵横、稻田相连的鱼米之乡。在百年不遇的大旱年景，增产都在60％以至一倍以上，谁都不能不承认这是个极其巨大的变化。穷队的生产发展，不仅有利于实现公社生产的全面跃进，而且也为加速由基本队有制过渡到基本社有制准备了极为有利的条件。
    许多“穷队”一年赶上富队的实践证明：“穷队”可以自力更生地摆脱目前比较困难的景况。这是因为：“穷队”蕴藏着巨大的生产潜力，社员有高度的战胜困难的志气，加上国家支持和公社的照顾，时间不要长，至多只要二、三年就可以翻过身来赶上甚至超过富队的生产水平和收入水平。
    “穷队”赶富队的关键在于加强党对“穷队”工作的领导。公社化以后，各县县委除了进行全面摸底排队，作出具体规划以外，都派出了大批干部到穷队帮助工作，或者常驻“穷队”担任领导职务，加强“穷队”的领导核心。有的采取县委书记、部长坐点包干、季末评比检查的办法，有的县采取部长、科、局长直接担任大队总支书记的办法，有的县采取县直机关分工包干的办法，有的县还采取了在穷队办党校，就地生根，加强教育的办法。采用这些办法以后，就直接地改变了某些穷队领导薄弱的状况，保证“穷队”赶富队的工作得到迅速开展。宿县原有七十六个“穷队”，由于派出了七十多个相当于县委委员一级的干部到穷队坐点包干，一年之内就有六十二个穷队赶上了富队或一般队的水平。由此可见，加强党对“穷队”工作的领导，是“穷队”赶富队的重要保证。
    为了使“穷队”迅速赶上富队，必须发动群众，树立雄心大志，坚持自力更生的原则。毛主席在“矛盾论”中说过：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”事实证明：穷队只有依靠自己的努力，发挥主观能动作用，才能充分挖掘本队的生产潜力，迅速实现由穷变富的愿望。拿五河县城关公社东卡子生产队为例，这个生产队是个最穷的队，邻队有些富裕农民经常讥讽他们“穷气扑人，沾上身就不得了”。可是东卡子队却以实际行动反击了这些冷言冷语，他们在公社党委的支持下，经常以“地穷志不穷，干劲就是宝；不吃馒头争口气，不赶富队誓不休”的口号来鼓励社员自力更生的志气，真是家家表决心，人人鼓干劲。因而仅仅一年时间，每人平均收入就猛增五倍以上，超过了本社富队的水平。这样的例子很多，它生动地说明了，只要把群众充分发动起来，立下雄心大志，我们就会获得战胜一切困难的力量。但是，在“穷队”赶富队运动刚刚开始的时候，也有少数同志只看到“穷队”的基础差、底子薄，人力、物力不足等困难的一面，却看不到人民公社无比强大的威力，看不到“穷队”蕴藏着无穷的生产潜力，也看不到广大社员在总路线、大跃进的鼓舞下，有着迅速改变贫困面貌的强烈愿望，所以存在畏难情绪，缺乏信心。在少数社员中，虽然有由穷变富的迫切要求，但由于他们长期受着自然条件的限制，不敢相信自己有战胜困难的力量，存在单纯依赖国家救济和公社支援的思想。他们说：“麻雀不能与大雁齐飞，穷队哪能赶上富队。”很明显，不解决这种思想，就不能在群众中树立由穷变富的信心。我们解决这种思想的主要方法，就是以人民公社为单位，普遍开展以“能不能赶富队，怎样赶富队”为中心的大辩论。通过辩论，摆出大量由穷变富的事实，层层树立由穷变富的标兵，总结由穷变富的经验。并发动“穷队”社员献计献策，找原因，找办法，制订由穷变富的计划。事实证明，凡是辩论深透的地方，群众的信心就很高，干劲也最大。因为辩论的过程，也就是认识客观的过程，抓住了客观事物的本质，就自然地会找到改造客观的步骤和方法。所以在辩论以后，绝大多数干部、社员，克服了畏难情绪和依赖思想，他们的结论是：“河能变，山能移，‘穷队’定能赶富队。”有些地方还组织“穷队”社员实地参观了已经由穷变富单位的先进经验，效果更加显著，普遍认为：“穷不是命运，富不是天生，只要发狠干，遍地出黄金。”他们纷纷表示要在一年之内或者两三年内赶上富队的生产水平和收入水平。
    从“穷队”本身来说，必须坚持自力更生的原则，但是为了使“穷队”迅速赶上富队，公社的照顾，国家的支持，也是完全必要的。人民公社成立以来，广大社员受到总路线的教育，思想觉悟大大提高，共产主义风格大大发扬，他们为了达到共同富裕的目的，从各方面支援了“穷队”。各地人民公社支援“穷队”的方法是很多的，如在物质上给以支持，在基本建设上给以帮助，从安排生产和种植作物上加以照顾等等。许多公社还采取少提公积金的办法给予照顾，在拖拉机、大型农具、新式农具的使用上也尽可能地满足了“穷队”的要求。许多富队除了积极参加全社范围内组织的劳力大协作以外，有的还自动地拿出资金、劳力支援“穷队”的基本建设和抗旱斗争。在去年夏收夏种和抗旱斗争中，中共安徽省委号召城镇干部、群众下乡支援农业生产，帮助“穷队”赶富队，这一号召迅速得到广大干部、群众的响应，参加这次下乡支援农业生产的共有一百多万名干部、工人和城镇居民。其中大部分人被分派到“穷队”参加二至三个月的劳动，不仅有力地支援了穷队的生产，而且极大地鼓舞了“穷队”干部、社员的积极性，进一步密切了工农关系、城乡关系，对锻炼干部，进一步提高城市人民的思想觉悟，也都起了很大作用。在1959年内，国家还先后拿出五千万元资金，无偿地支援了“穷队”。所有这些，对“穷队”的面貌的迅速改变都起了很大作用。
    为了使“穷队”迅速赶上富队，必须贯彻“以粮为纲”的方针。“穷队”赶上富队的标志，在粮食、经济作物和副业生产三方面都赶上或超过本社富队当年的平均水平，特别是粮食，最少要做到自给有余，并且要巩固坚持下来，经得起自然灾害的考验，即使遇到大灾也能过关。为了实现这一要求，我们在全面实行“八字宪法”、继续推行“三改”办法中，主要抓住了大搞农田基本建设，大力发展多种经营，大搞工具改革这三个主要环节。
    大搞农田基本建设，也就是大搞河网化、水利化，大搞土壤改良。这是贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展农业生产，彻底改变“穷队”面貌的根本措施。水利建设是农田基本建设的中心环节。1959年所以有许多“穷队”在一年之内就赶上富队，最重要的原因之一，就是他们在人民公社的大力支持下，充分发挥群众的冲天干劲，大兴水利和大搞土壤改良的结果。五河县濠城公社大庄大队，经过几年治淮和兴修水利，虽然改变了“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，不雨旱灾”的面貌，但水患还未根除，每年仍要遭受不同程度的旱涝灾害，生产很不稳定。办公社以后，得到了公社的支持，大干一冬一春，使全队范围内，共做土石方三十三万一千立方米，开挖大小沟渠一百六十多条，打井八十多眼，基本上实现了河网化。因此，去年夏季虽然又遇上八十多天不下雨的大旱，仍然保证了充足的水源，亩产比1958年提高53％，全大队每人平均有粮一千三百斤以上。群众歌唱道：“过去是排不完的水，现在是吃不完的粮，多年来的荒湖地，现在是遍地稻花香，真亏毛主席的好领导，穷湖洼也变成了天堂。”萧县黄口东方红人民公社，全境是个碱沙遍地，易旱易涝地区，在十五万五千亩土地中，碱地占50％，沙地占45％，解放以来虽然年年多施肥料，但仍然不能很快增产，公社化后，他们组织全社劳力大协作，从各方面挖掘劳动潜力，采取了翻碱土、垫肥土、控制径流、改种水稻等有效措施，战胜了重重困难，改良了土壤。按照群众自己的说法，叫做“土壤大革命”。因此，全社粮食、棉花的产量都比1958年增加50％以上。由于全面改良了土壤，全社原有五个穷队，现在已经有四个赶上了富队的生产水平。这些事实进一步说明了，只要把广大群众的主观能动性充分发挥起来，把各方面的积极因素充分调动起来，自然条件是可以改变的。
    大力发展多种经营，也是迅速改变“穷队”面貌的有效措施。“穷队”的生产所以没有赶上富队，还由于生产门路少，经营项目单纯，每年只靠一些粮食收入，而且产量不高，收入有限。因此，必须发展多种经济生产，特别是大力发展养猪、养羊等费力小、收效快的生产，养猪既能增加肥料，促进农作物增产，又能迅速增加“穷队”的现金收入。临泉县姜寨公社有个张楼大队，穷的主要原因就是多种经营没有发展。1958年多种经营收入只占总收入的12．1％，去年除公社分配他们多种了经济作物以外，并大力发展了畜牧业生产。特别发展了养猪事业。他们采取自繁自养的方针，“见母必留，先留后选”，去年全大队共留母猪四百四十二头，并推广热配、双重配的办法，提高了繁殖率。1959年全队养猪比1958年增加了三倍多，养羊也比1958年增加了三倍，各种家禽比1958年增加了四倍。一年就赶上了富队的收入水平。因此，在“穷队”生产的发展过程中，既要大抓粮食作物，又要大抓经济作物，既抓农业生产，又抓副业生产，使生产得到全面发展。
    大搞工具改革，不断提高劳动效率，是保证“穷队”生产迅速发展的又一个重要关键。如前所说，“穷队”的劳动力是十分缺乏的。这是“穷队”生产上的一个根本困难；可是在赶富队的过程中，又必然地要完成比富队更大的生产任务，要大兴水利，要大搞土壤改良，又要大力发展多种经营，都必须支付出更多的劳动力。因此，劳动力不足的矛盾，就成了当前“穷队”生产上的主要矛盾。安徽省各级党委在领导“穷队”赶富队运动中，对这个问题都十分重视，普遍开展了以工具改革为中心的高工效运动。这对挖掘“穷队”劳动潜力，保证各项生产建设计划的完成，具有极其重要的作用。宿县三八公社曹湖大队，根据去年年初的生产安排，全年共缺八万四千五百八十五个劳动日，比需要出勤的劳动日，相差五分之一以上，农忙时缺的更多。为解决这个问题，党总支决定大搞工具改革，大搞高工效运动；运动中并通过算账、辩论以及到富队参观等办法，号召社员克服守旧思想，破除迷信，做到“人人动脑筋，个个有创造”。由于发动了群众，一年来，全大队共提出合理化建议六百条，改进和创造了二千四百六十一件农具和工具，所需材料也大部是群众自筹解决。通过工具改革，使全队治水、提水、耕种、运肥、养猪、切菜等工效，普遍提高30％至几倍，有的提高了几十倍，不但解决了劳力不足困难，而且还腾出一百二十个劳动力参加养猪、积肥、开荒生产。
    一年多来，已有半数以上的“穷队”赶上了富队或一般队，取得了很大成绩。但是，我们绝不能满足于已有的成就，还应该看到：有些生产队1959年的经济收入虽然赶上来了，但粮食生产还没有赶上来，旱涝灾害还未根除，生产还不稳定，因此，还要继续努力，征服自然，全面地赶上富队。目前还有一些没有赶上富队的“穷队”，要更加一把劲，继续发扬社员群众战胜困难的志气，不屈不挠，再接再厉。安徽各地人民公社，正在根据一年多来“穷队”赶富队的经验，进一步加强对“穷队”工作的领导，充分发挥人民公社的强大威力，给“穷队”以更多的支持，力争尽快地改变所有“穷队”的经济面貌。
