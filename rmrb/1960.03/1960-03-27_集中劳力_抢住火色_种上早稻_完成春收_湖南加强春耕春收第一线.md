    Concentrating Labor, Seizing the Season, Planting Early Rice, Completing the Spring Harvest
    Hunan Strengthens the Front Lines of Spring Plowing and Spring Harvesting
    (Our newspaper Changsha, March 26th) In order to seize a continued leap forward in this year's agricultural production, Hunan Province has rapidly concentrated over 70% of its labor force, investing it in the front lines of major production centered on spring harvesting and spring plowing.
    Hunan Province plans to produce an average of 1,000 jin of grain and one pig per person this year. The planned area for early rice planting will increase from 17 million mu last year to 25 million mu, and the spring harvest of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops will reach 45 million mu, an increase of 15 million mu compared to last year. In order to achieve a double harvest of paddy fields and dry land, it is required to complete the spring harvest in mid-to-late April, seize the season to plant early rice, and also to plant 13 million mu of dry land miscellaneous grain crops before the early rice transplanting. In this way, this year's spring production tasks are greater than in any previous year, the time is very tight, and the quality requirements are even higher. As early as February, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee analyzed this situation and believed that the current time is a crucial juncture for winning a bumper harvest for the whole year. Winning time means victory. The Provincial Party Committee requested Party committees at all levels to make decisive decisions, to resolutely mobilize all the labor force in the countryside that can be concentrated, and invest it in the front lines of spring harvesting and spring plowing. This is the central link in winning a great victory in this year's spring production. The Provincial Party Committee issued a decision on February 23, which specifically required concentrating over 70% of the rural labor force to manage grain and cash crops (of which over 90% should be concentrated on managing grain production). In a work team, an average of one full laborer is required for every ten mu of paddy field or dry land.
    After the Provincial Party Committee's instructions were issued, all localities conscientiously studied and discussed them, and implemented them according to their specific local conditions. Party committees at all levels, on the one hand, explained to cadres the importance of concentrating labor to fight the spring harvest and spring plowing battle, and on the other hand, specifically checked the labor arrangements and took effective measures to quickly concentrate labor on the front lines of spring harvesting and spring plowing. The main measures are as follows: First, the labor force in water conservancy and transportation infrastructure construction, except for the necessary labor force left for key projects stipulated by the Provincial Party Committee, should be quickly transferred to the spring plowing front. Second, for the labor force used in factories and mines affiliated with communes and brigades, in accordance with the principle of "reducing people and increasing production" and "less work during the busy farming season, more work during the slack farming season," labor accounts should be carefully calculated, personnel should be reduced, and they should be invested in spring plowing. Anxiang County's Ancheng Commune extracted 250 people from industries run by the commune and brigades to invest in spring plowing. Third, under the principle of ensuring proper arrangements for the lives of commune members, strict fixed personnel and quotas are implemented in terms of living and welfare, and technological innovation and technological revolution movements are carried out among service personnel, organizing everyone to learn to be "multi-skilled," and extracting personnel to invest in spring plowing production. Longshan County, through the reform of cooking tools, extracted a total of 7,600 people from more than 3,600 canteens throughout the county to invest in spring plowing production. Fourth, postpone some things that can be temporarily postponed, freeing up labor. Fifth, organize all aspects of idle rural labor to invest in spring plowing. After taking the above measures, more than 70% of the 15,950,000 laborers in the province were invested in the front lines of spring harvesting and spring plowing by the end of February, meeting production needs.
    At present, on the spring harvesting and spring plowing front in Hunan Province, due to the concentration of labor, strong forces, and well-equipped soldiers, all production tasks are being grasped earlier, more solidly, and more comprehensively than in previous years. This year, all agricultural work in the province is half a month to twenty days earlier than in previous years. According to recent statistics, more than 570 million jin of early rice have been soaked, of which more than 110 million jin have been sown into mud. The planned area for early rice seedling fields is 3,078,000 mu, and 2,910,000 mu have now been prepared. The province averages about 300 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu of field, an increase of 40% compared to the same period last year. More than 9 million mu of spring-sown miscellaneous grain crops such as corn, sorghum, and spring buckwheat have now been planted, which is approximately equal to nine times the amount in the same period last year.

    集中劳力　抢住火色　种上早稻　完成春收
    湖南加强春耕春收第一线
    本报长沙26日电　为了夺取今年农业生产的继续跃进，湖南省迅速集中了70％以上的劳动力，投入以春收、春耕为中心的大生产第一线。
    湖南省计划今年平均每人生产一千斤粮食，一头猪。早稻种植面积计划由去年的一千七百万亩增加到二千五百万亩，春收麦子、油菜等作物达四千五百万亩，比去年增加一千五百万亩。为了取得水田旱地双丰收，要求在4月中、下旬完成春收，抢住火色种上早稻，同时还要把一千三百万亩旱地杂粮作物提前在早稻插秧以前种完。这样一来，今年的春季生产任务比以往任何一年都大，时间又很紧迫，质量要求得更高。早在2月间，中共湖南省委就分析了这一情况，认为当前是夺得全年大丰收的一个重要关口，赢得时间，就是胜利，省委要求各级党委当机立断，下决心调集农村中一切可以集中的劳力，投入春收、春耕第一线，这是夺取今年春季生产大胜利的中心环节。省委在2月23日发布决定，其中具体要求集中70％以上的农村劳动力经营粮食和经济作物（其中90％以上集中用于经营粮食生产）。在一个作业组中，要求每十亩水田或旱地，平均有一个整劳动力。
    省委的指示下达以后，各地都认真进行了研究讨论，根据本地区具体情况进行贯彻。各级党委一面向干部说明集中劳力打春收、春耕一仗的重要意义，一面具体检查了劳力安排情况，采取有效措施，迅速将劳力集中到春收、春耕第一线。主要措施有以下几点：第一、对水利、交通基本建设方面的劳动力，除省委规定的重点工程留下必要劳动力外，迅速转移到春耕战线上来。第二、对公社、大队所属厂矿企业所用的劳动力，本着“减人增产”、“农忙少搞，农闲大搞”的原则，算清劳动力账，紧缩人员，投入春耕。安乡县安城公社从社、队办的工业中抽出来投入春耕的人员就达二百五十人。第三、在保证安排好社员生活的原则下，生活福利方面严格实行定员定额，并且在服务性工作人员中开展技术革新和技术革命运动，组织大家学会做“一专多能”的多面手，抽出人员投入春耕生产。龙山县通过炊事工具的改革，全县三千六百多个食堂共抽出七千六百多人投入春耕生产。第四、推迟一些暂时可以不办的事情，腾出劳力。第五、组织农村各方面闲散劳力投入春耕。采取以上办法后，全省一千五百九十五万劳力在2月底就有70％以上投入春收、春耕的第一线，满足了生产需要。
    目前，湖南省春收、春耕战线由于劳力集中，兵强马壮，各项生产都比历年抓得早，抓得扎实，抓得全面。今年全省各项农活比往年提早半个月到二十天。据最近统计，早稻已浸种五亿七千多万斤，其中下泥的有一亿一千多万斤。早稻秧田计划面积三百零七万八千亩，现在已整好二百九十一万亩。全省平均每亩田已积肥料三百担左右，比去年同期增加40％。春播杂粮作物玉米、高粱、春荞等，现在已种下九百多万亩，大约等于去年同期的九倍。
