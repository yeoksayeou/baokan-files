    Turning Waste into Treasure
    Liu Youchang
    Legend has it that when the Living Buddha Ji Gong was supervising the construction of Jingci Temple by West Lake in Hangzhou, there were no large beams available. Ji Gong, in a moment of inspiration, displayed his divine powers and turned the wood shavings discarded from the carpentry workshop into a large beam, finally completing the construction of Jingci Temple. This legend is steeped in mythology, but today, the "divine power" of turning wood shavings into beams is no longer a big deal. Today, wood and boards made from shavings, sawdust, and the like are commonplace. Even after chemical treatment, shavings and sawdust can be transformed into many important industrial raw materials and beautiful household goods.
    In the wood processing, the remaining tops, scraps, shavings, and sawdust often account for about 20%-30% of the original wood, and sometimes even more. In the past, most of these wastes were burned as fuel, except for a portion of sawdust used as a base for mosquito-repellent incense. At most, they were only used as raw materials for papermaking. Now, with the continuous development of science and technology, in order to better utilize everything, these so-called "wastes" have become important raw materials for various industries.
    By adding some adhesives to shavings or sawdust and pressing them, large sheets of particleboard or fiberboard can be made. This kind of artificial board is not only large in area, beautiful in pattern, and inexpensive, but also far superior to ordinary wood boards in terms of sound insulation and heat insulation. Therefore, it can be used to replace ordinary wood wherever the load is not too great. For example, it is very suitable for use as ceilings, floors, room partitions, insulation boards, and sound insulation boards.
    If the wood, which has been crushed and mixed with adhesives, is pressed in special molds, it can also be directly pressed into various wooden furniture or parts, which are not only beautiful in appearance but also quite economical. The affordable housing that has appeared in some areas of China not only uses a large amount of artificial boards indoors, but also uses artificial boards for the roofs. This is done by adding waterproof substances and pressing them into corrugated large sheets of wood shavings to replace bricks and tiles.
    If wood shavings, sawdust, or other waste wood is strongly heated in the absence of air, that is, so-called dry distillation, three parts can be obtained: solid (charcoal), liquid (aqueous layer and wood tar), and gas (combustible gas). Besides charcoal, the liquid part is a particularly important product, containing a variety of important organic raw materials, such as acetic acid, methanol, and acetone. Wood tar contains a considerable amount of phenolic substances. These substances are important solvents or bactericides themselves, and they are also important raw materials for manufacturing artificial fragrances, artificial fibers, plastics, explosives, and medicines. The charcoal remaining after dry distillation, after activation treatment in an activation furnace, becomes activated carbon, which can be widely used in chemical, pharmaceutical, sugar and other industries.
    Wood waste is mainly composed of cellulose, which generally accounts for about 50%-70% of wood. It also contains hemicellulose, lignin and other substances. After the wood waste is crushed and treated by strong chemical methods, various impurities can be removed to obtain relatively pure cellulose. Cellulose is the raw material for making various rayon fibers. Common celluloid products are made by nitrating cellulose with nitric acid and then combining it with camphor. Celluloid has a wide range of uses, but its shortcoming is that it is extremely flammable. Therefore, cellulose is then reacted with acetic anhydride to obtain cellulose acetate, which is a better material than celluloid because it is non-flammable and is an excellent raw material for manufacturing plastics, film, rayon, cellophane, waterproof glue, and the like.
    In order to better utilize a large amount of wood waste, many countries have established a new type of industry in recent years - the hydrolysis industry. The hydrolysis industry can hydrolyze wood waste using concentrated sulfuric acid at low temperature or dilute sulfuric acid at high temperature and high pressure to produce glucose. The Zhejiang Forestry Science Institute in China obtains 20 kilograms of edible glucose from every 100 kilograms of wood shavings through hydrolysis. The glucose obtained from wood hydrolysis is usually used directly for fermentation into alcohol without purification. According to Soviet data, from one ton of dry wood waste, in addition to obtaining 200 to 250 liters of alcohol, 30 to 40 kilograms of protein yeast, 25 to 30 kilograms of liquid carbon dioxide, 4 to 7 kilograms of furfural, 250 to 300 kilograms of dehydrated lignin, and 10 to 15 kilograms of other chemical products can also be obtained. Obviously, it is of great economic value to use wood waste instead of grain to produce glucose and alcohol.

    废料变成宝
    刘有常
    传说济公活佛当年在杭州西子湖畔监造净慈寺，可是没有大梁，济公急中生智，大显神通，用木工场废弃的刨花搓成了一根大梁，终于完成了净慈寺的建筑。这个传说，神话色彩很浓，不过到了今天，用刨花搓成大梁的这种“神通”也算不了怎么一回事了。今天，用刨花、木屑等制成的木材、木板，已是很平常的东西；甚至经过化学方法一处理，刨花、木屑还会摇身一变，变成许多重要的工业原料和漂亮的生活用品。
    木材在加工过程中，剩下的梢头、边料、刨花、木屑，往往要占原有木材的20％—30％左右，有时甚至还要多些。这些废料，以前除了木屑有部分用作土蚊烟的基料外，多数是作为燃料烧掉的。至多也只是作为造纸的原料。现在随着科学技术的不断发展，为了更好的做到物尽其用，这些所谓“废料”已经成为多种工业的重要原料了。
    在刨花或木屑中加入一些胶合物质，经过加压处理后，就可以制成大张的刨花板或纤维板。这种人造板不但面积大，花纹美观，价格低廉，而且在隔音、绝热等方面，还远较普通木板为佳，因此只要不是负荷过大的地方，都可用它代替普通木材。如用作天花板、地板、房间隔板、绝热板、隔音板等，都很适宜。
    已经粉碎并加入胶合物质的木材，如果在特制的模型中加压，还可以直接压制成各种木质家具或零件，不但外观美丽，而且也颇经济实惠。在我国某些地区出现的经济住宅，不但室内采用了大量人造板，就是屋面也是用人造板做的，这是在里面加入了防水物质，并且压制成波浪形的大张木屑板，用来代替砖瓦。
    如果将木屑、刨花或其他废木料，在隔绝空气的情况下强热，即所谓干馏，就可以获得固体（木炭）、液体（水层和木焦油）和气体（可燃气）三个部分。这里面除了木炭以外，液体部分是特别重要的产物，它含有多种重要的有机原料，如醋酸、甲醇、丙酮等。在木焦油中则含有相当量的酚类物质。这些物质本身是重要的溶剂或杀菌剂，而且它们还是制造人造香精、人造纤维、塑料、炸药、药物的重要原料。干馏剩下的木炭，经过活化炉的活化处理后，就变成了活性炭，可大量的用于化学、制药、制糖等工业。
    木材废料主要是由纤维素组成，一般占木材的50％—70％左右。其他还含有半纤维素、木质素等物质。将木材废料粉碎后，并经过强烈的化学方法处理后，就能够将各种杂质除去，而得到比较纯净的纤维素。纤维素是制造多种人造丝的原料。常见的赛璐珞制品，就是纤维素经过硝酸的硝化后，再和樟脑一起制成的。赛璐珞的用途很广，美中不足的是它极易燃烧，因此以后又将纤维素和醋酸酐作用，制得醋酸纤维，它是比赛璐珞更为优秀的物质，因为它不能燃烧，是制造塑料、电影软片、人造丝、玻璃纸、防水胶等的优秀原料。
    为了更好地利用大量木材废料，近年来许多国家都已建立起一种新型的工业——水解工业。水解工业可以将木材废料，在用浓硫酸低温或稀硫酸高温高压的情况下进行水解，而制得葡萄糖。我国浙江林业科学研究所从每百斤木屑水解制得二十斤食用葡萄糖。从木材水解得来的葡萄糖，通常是不经提纯就直接用来发酵成酒精的。根据苏联的资料，从一吨干木材废料中，除了可以得到二百到二百五十公升酒精外，还可以得到三十到四十公斤蛋白质酵母，二十五到三十公斤液体二氧化碳，四到七公斤糠醛，二百五十到三百公斤脱水木质素，以及十到十五公斤其他化学产品。显而易见的，用木材废料代替粮食来制取葡萄糖、酒精，是具有重大经济价值的。
