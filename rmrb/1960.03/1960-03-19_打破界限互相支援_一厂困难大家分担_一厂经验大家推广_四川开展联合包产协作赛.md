Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch. Sichuan is promoting the experience of Leshan Prefecture by launching a widespread joint contracted production collaboration competition. Participating units, on the basis of greatly promoting the spirit of Communist cooperation, are breaking down the boundaries between factories, regions, and industries. Under common competition targets, they are collaborating and supporting each other in all aspects, including materials, technology, and equipment. If one factory falls short in production, everyone contracts to make up for it. If one factory has difficulties, everyone supports it. If one factory has experience, everyone promotes it. This has mobilized positive factors from all sides and promoted an overall leap forward in all aspects of production.
	Leshan Prefecture is one of the main iron-producing regions in Sichuan Province. The Leshan Iron and Steel Plant, Qianghua Iron and Steel Plant, Wutongqiao Iron and Steel Plant, and Zhongchuan Iron Plant in this prefecture, in order to achieve sustained high production before and after the Spring Festival, after full consultation, formulated competition conditions and jointly signed a contracted production competition agreement, working together to achieve the target of producing 1,000 tons of iron per day. The Leshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party actively supported this initiative and immediately organized coal, coke, mining, transportation, and other relevant departments to respond, and strengthened the leadership of the competition. In order to ensure that the four iron and steel plants achieved the target of producing 1,000 tons of iron per day, the Jiayang, Longchi, Jixiang, Fenglai, and other six coal mines jointly proposed a target of producing 10,000 tons of coal and 2,000 tons of coke per day, and launched a competition. The Xinhua, Xinchang, and Lijiashan three mining sites also jointly guaranteed to produce 30 tons of ore per day to supply the blast furnaces. The transportation department also put forward the slogan of "transport as much as needed" to ensure that the blast furnaces had enough "grain and grass." More than ten units participating in the competition jointly established a leading group responsible for inspection and supervision, and regular evaluations. In this way, a large-scale joint contracted production collaboration competition was first launched in an organized and led manner on the iron and steel, coal and coke, mining, and transportation fronts. Subsequently, this competition was rapidly promoted to all walks of life throughout the prefecture. In February, the main departments in this prefecture, such as iron, coke, transportation, machinery, electricity, light industry, and chemical industry, all completed or exceeded their plans.
	The main feature of the joint contracted production collaboration competition is to build advanced production targets that can be achieved through effort on the basis of a mass movement of Communist cooperation, and to further promote the collectivist thinking of each unit. In the competition, the broad masses of workers regarded the tasks of other factories as their own, and the difficulties of others as their own, thereby strengthening cooperation and mutual assistance on a larger scale. For example, because the Wutongqiao Iron and Steel Plant failed to meet the competition target due to an accident at the blast furnace, the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant took the initiative to contract for the output they owed, revising the original target of producing 330 tons of iron per day to 350 tons, and mobilized workers to take measures in all aspects to ensure completion. After the daily output of pig iron at the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant increased, the supply of ore could not keep up, and the Qianghua Iron and Steel Plant took the initiative to allocate its stored ore to ensure the needs of Leshan Iron and Steel Plant's increased production.
	The launch of the joint contracted production collaboration competition has pushed the labor competition within factories and mines to a new climax. In order to achieve the various competition targets proposed in the joint contracted production contract, each iron and steel plant generally carried out a layer-by-layer contracted production competition of teams contracting blast furnaces, blast furnaces contracting workshops, and workshops contracting the entire plant. Coal mines launched a chain contracted production competition of tunneling and transportation contracting coal mining, and coal mining and transportation contracting coking. The transportation department launched a competition craze in which maintenance, loading and unloading, dispatching, and driving were all closely linked. In the competition, all enterprises further promoted the atmosphere of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," and advanced experiences were widely exchanged. In February alone, the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant achieved 108 major technical innovations, increasing the plant's daily pig iron output by 51% compared with January. The average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces increased from 1.26 to 1.8. After the steel system in the entire prefecture promptly exchanged and promoted this plant's experience in high quality and high yield, the average utilization coefficient immediately increased from 0.859 in January to 0.93. After the coal mine system promoted the advanced experience of Longchi Coal Mine in blast furnace coking, the coking time was generally shortened by about one-third compared with before. After the mining system promoted the Lijiashan Mining Site's transportation experience of large-scale one-net five-ization, the daily ore transportation volume increased by more than 30% compared with January, effectively solving the contradiction that short-distance transportation could not keep up with the needs of blast furnaces.
	The launch of the joint contracted production collaboration competition has also promoted a deeper leadership style, and the enterprise management experience of "two participations, one transformation, and three combinations" has been further developed. At present, the leading cadres of most factories and mines in the entire prefecture have planted "experimental fields" and "command fields." The Secretary of the Party Committee of the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant used the method of three combinations to plant "experimental fields" on a 33-cubic-meter blast furnace, actively transforming the furnace type and air supply system, and strengthening the management of raw materials and fuels, so that the average utilization coefficient of the plant's three 33-cubic-meter blast furnaces reached 2.43, and the sulfur content of pig iron was reduced to 0.78, breaking the superstition that 33-cubic-meter blast furnaces could not sustain large-scale high yield and high quality. Many factories and mines mobilized the masses to participate in management, further improving the level of enterprise management.

    打破界限互相支援　一厂困难大家分担　一厂经验大家推广
    四川开展联合包产协作赛
    首创这一经验的乐山专区钢铁煤炭等部门全面跃进
    据新华社成都电　四川各地厂矿企业职工推广乐山专区的经验，正在广泛开展联合包产协作大竞赛。参加竞赛的单位，在共产主义协作精神大发扬的基础上，打破厂与厂、地区与地区、产业与产业之间的界限，在共同的竞赛指标下，从物资、技术、设备等各个方面互相协作支援，一厂短产，大家包产；一厂困难，大家支援；一厂有经验，大家推广。因此调动了各方面的积极因素，促进各项生产全面跃进。
    乐山专区是四川省的主要产铁地区之一。这个专区的乐山钢铁厂、强华钢铁厂、五通桥钢铁厂、中川铁厂等四个单位，为了实现春节前后持续高产，经过充分协商，订出竞赛条件，联合签订包产竞赛合同，共同为实现日产千吨铁的指标而努力。中共乐山地委积极支持了这一倡议，立即组织煤焦、矿山、运输等有关部门响应，并且加强了竞赛的领导。为了保证四个钢铁厂实现日产千吨铁的指标，嘉阳、龙池、吉祥、凤来等六个煤矿，联合提出了日产万吨煤、二千吨焦炭的指标，展开竞赛；新华、新场、李家山三个采矿场也联合保证日产三十吨矿石，供应高炉；运输部门也提出
  “要多少运多少”的口号，保证高炉有足够的“粮草”。参加竞赛的十多个单位联合成立了领导小组，负责检查督促，定期评比。这样，一个规模巨大的联合包产协作竞赛，便首先在钢铁、煤焦、矿山、运输战线上有组织有领导地展开。接着，这一竞赛又迅速地推广到了全专区的各行各业。2月份，这个专区的生铁、煤焦、运输、机械、电力、轻化工等主要部门，都完成或超额完成了计划。
    联合包产协作竞赛的主要特点，是把经过努力能够达到的先进生产指标建筑在共产主义大协作的群众运动的基础上，进一步发扬各个单位的集体主义思想。竞赛中，广大职工都把别厂的任务当作本厂的任务，把别人的困难当成自己的困难，从而在更大范围内加强了协作互助。例如：五通桥钢铁厂由于高炉发生意外事故没有达到竞赛指标，乐山钢铁厂就主动把他们欠下的产量包下来，把本厂原订日产三百三十吨铁的指标修订为三百五十吨，并发动职工从各方面采取措施保证完成。乐山钢铁厂生铁日产量上升后，矿石供应不上，强华钢铁厂又主动把自己储存的矿石调剂出来，保证了乐山钢铁厂增产的需要。
    联合包产协作竞赛的开展，把厂矿企业内部的劳动竞赛推向了新的高潮。为了实现联合包产合同中提出的各项竞赛指标，各钢铁厂普遍开展了小组联合包高炉、高炉联合包车间、车间联合包全厂的层层包产竞赛；煤矿开展了掘进、运输包采煤，采煤、运输包炼焦的连环包产竞赛；交通运输部门掀起了保修、装卸、调度、行驶一环紧扣一环的竞赛热潮。各个企业在竞赛中都进一步发扬了“学、比、赶、帮”的风气，先进经验得到广泛交流。2月份，仅乐山钢铁厂就实现了重大技术革新一百零八项，使全厂生铁日产量比1月份增长51％。高炉平均利用系数由一点二六提高到一点八。全专区钢铁系统及时交流推广了这个厂的优质高产经验后，平均利用系数立即由1月份的零点八五九提高到零点九三。煤矿系统推广了龙池煤矿鼓风炼焦的先进经验后，焦化时间比以前普遍缩短三分之一左右。矿山系统推广李家山采矿场大搞一网五化的运输经验后，矿石日运量比1月份提高30％以上，有效地解决了短途运输跟不上高炉需要的矛盾。
    联合包产协作竞赛的开展，还促使领导作风更加深入，“两参一改三结合”的企业管理经验进一步发展。目前，全专区大多数厂矿企业的领导干部都种了“试验田”和“指挥田”。乐山钢铁厂党委书记在三十三立方米高炉上，采用三结合的办法种“试验田”，积极改造炉型和送风系统，加强原料燃料管理，使全厂三座三十三立方米高炉的平均利用系数达到二点四三，生铁含硫量降低到零点七八，破除了三十三立方米高炉不能持续大面积高产优质的迷信。不少厂矿企业发动群众参加管理，进一步提高了企业管理水平。
