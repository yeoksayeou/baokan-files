Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 23rd: Bulgaria's Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Yugov, said here today: In response to the Party's call, a people's movement to strive for the early completion of the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) is developing increasingly widely throughout Bulgaria. Due to this unprecedented national upsurge, in terms of growth in the main sectors of material production in Bulgaria, the Third Five-Year Plan will be able to be completed in three years, that is, by the end of 1960.

Yugov made these remarks at the Dimitrov Prize award ceremony. At the award ceremony, he presented the prizes to Bulgarian science, culture, and art workers who made great contributions to Bulgaria's socialist construction cause between 1954 and 1958.

In his speech, Yugov said that science, culture, and art workers have not lagged behind in the national movement to strive for the early completion of the Third Five-Year Plan. He also emphasized the importance of establishing close ties between science, culture, and art workers and production, and the practice of socialist construction. He said, "Only in the tide of our country's rapid socialist construction, in the process of scientifically summarizing and solving the problems raised by socialist construction, can science be enriched and developed, and can it constantly move towards the peak of world scientific thought."

Yugov said that there is no doubt that the fundamental reason for all the achievements made in science, culture, and art is Bulgaria's socialist reality and the correct policies implemented by the Bulgarian Communist Party. The inexhaustible source of the entire development of Bulgaria, the prosperity and development of Bulgarian science, culture, and art, is the immortal Marxist-Leninist ideology.

In his speech, Yugov called on Bulgarian science, culture, and art workers to more closely link themselves with production and socialist practice, go more to the people, get closer to life, and make greater contributions to Bulgaria's socialist construction cause.

    于哥夫在季米特洛夫奖金授奖仪式上说
    保加利亚五年计划将三年完成
    新华社索非亚23日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫今天在这里说：根据党的号召，在保加利亚全国各地正在日益广泛地开展争取提前完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）的人民运动。由于出现了这种空前的全民高涨，保加利亚在物质生产的主要部门的增长方面，第三个五年计划将在三年内，即到1960年底，就能够完成了。
    于哥夫是在季米特洛夫奖金授奖仪式上讲这番话的。在授奖仪式上，他把奖金授给了在1954到1958年间对保加利亚社会主义建设事业作出巨大贡献的保加利亚科学、文化和艺术工作者。
    于哥夫在讲话中说，在争取提前完成第三个五年计划的全民运动中，科学、文化和艺术工作者并没有落后。他还强调了科学、文化和艺术工作者同生产、同社会主义建设实际建立密切联系的重要性。他说，“只有在我国的迅速的社会主义建设的浪潮里，在科学地总结和解决社会主义建设提出的问题的过程中，科学才能够得到丰富和发展，才能够不断走向世界科学思想的顶峰”。
    于哥夫说，毫无疑问，在科学、文化和艺术方面获得的所有成就的根本原因，是保加利亚的社会主义现实和保加利亚共产党执行的正确的政策。整个保加利亚的发展、保加利亚科学、文化和艺术的繁荣和发展的永不竭涸的源泉，是永垂不朽的马克思列宁主义思想。
    于哥夫在讲话中号召保加利亚科学、文化和艺术工作者更加密切地同生产、同社会主义实际联系，更多地到人民中去，更接近生活，为保加利亚的社会主义建设事业作出更大贡献。
