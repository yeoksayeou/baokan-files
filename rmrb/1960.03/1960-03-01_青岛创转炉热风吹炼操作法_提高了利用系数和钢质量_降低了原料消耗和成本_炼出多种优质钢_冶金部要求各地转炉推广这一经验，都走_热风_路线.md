    Qingdao Creates Converter Hot Air Blowing Operation Method
    Improves Utilization Coefficient and Steel Quality, Reduces Raw Material Consumption and Costs, and Refines Various High-Quality Steels
    The Ministry of Metallurgy Requires All Regions to Promote This Experience and Follow the "Hot Air" Route
    (Our newspaper, Qingdao, 29th) The broad masses of steelmaking workers in Qingdao City, carrying forward the communist style of daring to think and act, have carried out major innovations in converter blowing technology, creatively experimented successfully, and universally promoted the advanced operation method of converter preheating blast intensification blowing. At present, the utilization coefficient of small converters in the city has increased from about 27 tons when cold air was blown to 34 tons. The first-grade steel rate of many steelmaking units has increased from 60% to over 80%, and some have reached about 95%. The consumption of raw materials and the cost of steelmaking have also been further reduced, and more than ten kinds of high-quality steel and low-alloy steel have been refined. This major innovation in Qingdao has created extremely favorable conditions for small converters to compete with electric furnaces and catch up with open-hearth furnaces.
    After the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promoted hot-air alkaline iron-smelting furnaces and alkaline converters throughout the city and conquered high sulfur, it educated workers to establish the idea of continuous revolution and boldly innovate technology, so that the production level of small converters continued to rise. According to their experience in production practice, the workers deeply felt that if the blowing temperature could not be increased significantly, it would not be easy to significantly shorten the blowing time, increase the output and quality of steel, reduce the consumption of raw materials, and increase the variety of products. Therefore, they turned the spearhead of technological innovation to increasing the blowing temperature. Based on the experience that hot air can be used in iron-smelting furnaces, they were determined to boldly create and change the converter from cold air blowing to hot air blowing.
    The suggestion of using hot air blowing in converters in Qingdao City has received the attention and strong support of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. The Qingdao Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau immediately designated the steelmaking workshop of the Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, which has a good steelmaking foundation, to carry out this experiment, and sent technicians to the factory to provide specialized assistance. Although the 0.5-ton converter of the Vehicle Manufacturing Factory failed several times in this experiment, thanks to the attention of the factory Party committee and workshop leaders and the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm, especially the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's repeated dispatch of people to the site for guidance, after continuous exploration and improvement, the experiment finally blossomed and bore fruit. They transformed the tubular hot air kiln originally used for iron-smelting furnaces into a hot air furnace as a preheating device, located between the blower and the converter, so that the cold air blown out by the blower passes through the high-temperature pipeline of the hot air furnace, and the air temperature rises to above 300 degrees (Celsius, same below), and the highest is more than 400 degrees. As the wind temperature increased, the air expanded. They still used the original tuyeres at the beginning of blowing, and the operation was not smooth enough. After research, they found that the hot air path was not very smooth. To make the air path smooth, the tuyeres must be enlarged. Therefore, the tuyere area was enlarged from 35 mm to 45 mm, and the air pipe was appropriately thickened, so that the air path was smooth. At the same time, in order to achieve intensified blowing, the pulley of the blower was also enlarged, so that the speed was increased from 480 revolutions per minute to 600 revolutions per minute. After this series of improvements, the converter changed from cold air blowing to hot air blowing, and finally achieved success.
    Since October last year, Qingdao City has been experimenting, producing, and improving. At present, this hot air blowing operation method has been fully implemented in seventeen sets of various types of converters ranging from 0.5 tons to 6 tons that have been put into production. During the promotion process, all steelmaking units have also made technical transformations to the equipment in a simple and economical way without affecting the effect. For example, the hot air furnaces in many units such as the No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant and the State Cotton No. 6 Factory Steelmaking Workshop are all transformed from the spare hot air kilns of iron-smelting furnaces. The hot air temperature can generally reach above 300 degrees, and the highest can reach more than 400 degrees.
    According to the promotion situation of small converters in Qingdao in the past few months, hot air blowing has the following advantages: (1) Shorten blowing time. When hot air blowing is adopted, and the wind temperature is above 300 degrees, as long as the converter tuyere is appropriately enlarged, the blowing time can generally be shortened by 30%-50% compared with cold air blowing; if the equipment of other processes can adapt to this, the steel output can be increased by about one-third. (2) Increase the temperature of molten steel. If the hot air temperature reaches above 300 degrees, using the same temperature of molten iron, the temperature of molten steel obtained by hot air blowing can generally be increased from 1,460 degrees to about 1,550 degrees, or even 1,600 degrees, compared with cold air blowing. Due to the increase in the temperature of molten steel, the defects such as sticking and short ingots that were prone to occur in the past have been basically overcome. (3) Improve the quality of steel. The use of hot air increases the temperature in the converter furnace, which improves slag formation and is conducive to desulfurization. Desulfurization by cold air blowing generally only reaches about 10%, and sometimes even back-sulfurization occurs; the desulfurization efficiency of hot air blowing is as high as about 50%. Therefore, even pig iron with a sulfur content of more than 0.5% can be used to make good steel. (4) Save raw materials and reduce costs. Before using hot air, due to insufficient blowing temperature, several kilograms or even more than ten kilograms of silicon iron were required to increase the temperature for each furnace of steel; after changing to hot air, there is no need to add any temperature-increasing agent. According to rough calculations by the Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, this item alone can reduce the cost of each furnace of steel by about 30 yuan. In addition, the use of hot air also has a certain effect on reducing the consumption of pig iron and ferromanganese. (5) Refine multiple varieties of steel. After hot air blowing, the temperature of molten steel is significantly increased, which is not only easy to cast ingots, but also provides very favorable conditions for producing multiple varieties of steel. At present, small converters in Qingdao have increased from only being able to produce one type of ordinary carbon steel during cold air blowing to being able to produce more than ten types of high-quality steel and low-alloy steel such as spring steel, welding rod steel, silicon steel, 16 manganese steel, and 25 manganese silicon steel. In addition, special small steel ingots of 75×55 mm are also cast. This kind of steel ingot does not need to be opened, and can be directly rolled into material with a small rolling mill or even an electric hammer, which is very suitable for promotion in small-scale industries and commune industries. (6) Waste steel can be mixed in. Due to the greatly increased blowing temperature, an appropriate amount of waste steel can also be put into the converter. Generally, 30 to 50 kilograms of waste steel can be put into each furnace, and high-temperature molten steel can still be obtained without affecting the quality of the ingot. In addition, because the converter adopts hot air blowing, it is not only easier to master the blowing operation, but also basically avoids the shortcomings of molten steel bag bonding, greatly reduces the bag repair time, and the ingot casting is also very smooth, thus greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers.
    The hot air blowing operation method adopted by the Qingdao converter, after the summary and appraisal by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, believes that it is a direction to comprehensively improve the production level of the converter. In the future, the converter production should take "hot air" as the key and follow the "hot air" route. Therefore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided that hot air blowing should not only be universally promoted in medium and small converters, but also universally promoted in large converters.

    青岛创转炉热风吹炼操作法
    提高了利用系数和钢质量　降低了原料消耗和成本　炼出多种优质钢
    冶金部要求各地转炉推广这一经验，都走“热风”路线
    本报青岛29日电　青岛市广大炼钢职工发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，对转炉的吹炼技术进行了重大革新，创造性地试验成功和普遍推广了转炉预热鼓风强化吹炼的先进操作法。目前全市小转炉的利用系数，已由冷风吹炼时的二十七吨左右提高到三十四吨，许多炼钢单位的一级钢率由60％提高到80％以上，有的达95％左右，炼钢的原料耗用量和成本也进一步降低，并炼出了十多种优质钢和低合金钢。青岛市这一重大革新，给小转炉赛电炉、赶平炉创造了极为有利的条件。
    中共青岛市委在全市推行热风碱性化铁炉和碱性转炉，征服高硫的基础上，教育职工们树立不断革命的思想，大胆革新技术，使小转炉生产水平节节向上。职工们根据生产实践的体会，深深感觉到，如果不能较大幅度地提高吹炼温度，要显著地缩短吹炼时间、提高钢的产量和质量、降低原料耗用量及增加产品品种等等，那是不易做到的。于是，他们就把革新技术的矛头转到提高吹炼温度上来，根据化铁炉可以用热风操作的经验，决心大胆创造，使转炉变冷风吹炼为热风吹炼。
    青岛市提出转炉用热风吹炼的建议，得到了冶金工业部的重视和大力支持。青岛市冶金工业局即指定炼钢基础较好的车辆制造厂炼钢车间进行这项试验，并派出技术员住厂作专门帮助。车辆制造厂的零点五吨转炉，虽在进行这项试验中失败了几次，但由于厂党委和车间领导干部的重视，群众的革命干劲足，特别是冶金工业部多次派人到现场指导，经过不断地摸索和改进，终于使试验开花结果。他们将原来化铁炉用的管式热风窑改装成热风炉，作为预热设备，设于鼓风机和转炉之间，使鼓风机吹出的冷风，经过热风炉的高温管道，风温上升到三百度（摄氏，下同）以上，最高四百多度。风温提高了，空气就发生膨胀。他们在开始吹炼时，仍用原来的风眼，操作不够顺利，经过研究，发现热风去路不很畅通，要使风路畅通，必须加大风眼。于是，就把风眼面积由三十五公厘放大到四十五公厘，并适当加粗了风管，这样，风路就畅通了。同时，为了达到强化吹炼，又加大了鼓风机的皮带轮，使转速由每分钟四百八十转提高到六百转。经过这一系列的改进，转炉变冷风吹炼为热风吹炼，终于获得成功。
    青岛市经过自去年10月以来几个月的边试验、边生产、边改进，目前已在投入生产的零点五吨至六吨的十七组各种型号的转炉中，全面推行了这种热风吹炼操作法。在推行的过程中，各炼钢单位还都在不影响效果的前提下，因陋就简地对设备作了技术改造。如第二钢铁厂、国棉六厂炼钢车间等许多单位的热风炉，都是利用化铁炉的备用热风窑改装的，热风温度一般可达三百度以上，最高达到四百多度。
    根据青岛小转炉几个月来的推行情况，热风吹炼具有以下一些优点：（一）缩短吹炼时间。采用热风吹炼，风温在三百度以上时，只要适当加大转炉风眼，吹炼时间一般能比冷风吹炼缩短30％—50％；如其他工序的设备能与此相适应，钢产量可提高三分之一左右。（二）提高钢水温度。如热风温度达三百度以上，用同样温度的铁水，热风吹炼比冷风吹炼所获得的钢水温度，一般能从一千四百六十度提高到一千五百五十度左右，甚至一千六百度。由于钢水温度提高，基本上克服了以往容易出现的粘包和浇短锭等缺陷。（三）提高钢的质量。采用热风使转炉炉内温度提高，化渣得到改善，有利于脱硫。冷风吹炼脱硫一般只达10％左右，有时甚至还发生回硫现象；采用热风吹炼，脱硫效率高达50％左右。因此，即使含硫0．5％以上的生铁，也能炼出好钢。（四）节约原料，降低成本。采用热风前，由于吹炼温度不够，每炉钢均需投加几公斤以至十多公斤的矽铁提温；改热风后，就不需投加任何提温剂。据车辆制造厂粗略计算，仅此一项，就能使每炉钢的成本降低三十元左右。此外，采用热风后，对降低生铁和锰铁的耗用量也有一定作用。（五）炼出多品种钢。热风吹炼后，钢水温度显著提高，不但易于铸锭，而且为生产多品种钢提供了很有利的条件。目前，青岛的小转炉，已由冷风吹炼时只能生产一种普通炭素钢，猛增到能生产弹簧钢、焊条钢、矽钢、十六号锰钢、二十五号锰矽钢等十多种优质钢和低合金钢。此外，还浇铸出75×55公厘的特小型钢锭，这种钢锭不需开坯，用小型轧钢机甚至电锤可直接轧制成材，很适宜于小型工业和公社工业推广。（六）可以掺用废钢。由于吹炼温度大大提高，还能向转炉内投入适量的废钢。一般每炉可投入三十至五十公斤废钢，仍能获得高温钢水，并不影响铸锭的质量。此外，由于转炉采用热风吹炼，不仅在吹炼操作上较容易掌握，而且基本上避免了钢水包粘结的缺点，包子修理时间大大减少，铸锭也很顺利，因此，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。
    青岛转炉采用的热风吹炼操作法，经过冶金工业部总结、鉴定，认为它是全面提高转炉生产水平的一个方向，今后的转炉生产要以“热风”为纲，都要走“热风”路线。因此，冶金工业部决定：热风吹炼不仅要在中、小转炉普遍推广，而且要在大型转炉中普遍推广。
