    Common Knowledge

    Bacteriophages are a large class of microorganisms widely present on Earth. They survive and reproduce by dissolving bacteria and obtaining nutrients from them. They are smaller than bacteria and can only be seen under an electron microscope; they are shaped like tadpoles or are circular.

    Wherever bacteria exist, bacteriophages are likely to be present. Bacteriophages can only feed on living bacteria and cannot dissolve dead bacteria. A certain type of bacteriophage can only dissolve a certain type of bacteria. For example, typhoid bacteriophages can only dissolve typhoid bacilli and cannot dissolve other types of bacteria.

    Bacteriophages have great uses in biology and medicine. For example, when Shanghai Guangci Hospital was rescuing Qiu Caikang from extensive burns, it used Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages to treat his Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia infection in a timely manner. In addition, bacteriophages can also be used for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as dysentery and typhoid fever. With the progress of research, the applications of bacteriophages will become more numerous and widespread.

    吃细菌的微生物
    噬菌体是在地球上广泛存在着的一大类微生物。它依靠溶解细菌、并从中取得养料而生存和繁殖。它的体积比细菌小，在电子显微镜下才能看到；形状像蝌蚪或呈圆形。
    凡有细菌存在的地方，都可能有噬菌体的存在。噬菌体只能以活细菌为食物，而不能溶解已死的细菌。某一种噬菌体只能溶解某种细菌。例如，伤寒噬菌体只能溶解伤寒杆菌，而不能溶解别种细菌。
    噬菌体在生物学和医学上都有很大用途，如上海广慈医院在抢救丘财康的大面积烧伤时，就曾应用绿脓杆菌噬菌体及时地治疗了他的绿脓杆菌败血症的感染。此外，噬菌体在痢疾、伤寒等病中，也能用为预防和治疗。随着研究工作的进展，噬菌体的应用还会更多更广。
