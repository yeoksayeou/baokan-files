Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 8th. Sichuan is widely carrying out a spring hatching campaign for poultry. The Neijiang Special District has already trained more than 700 incubation technicians, and more than 100 artificial incubation rooms have been put into production, incubating more than 2 million eggs, and more than 80,000 chicks have already been hatched. In the Xichang Special District, which is rich in Jianchang ducks known for their fat, large size, and thick meat, the work of selecting and retaining seeds was stepped up at the end of last year. Xichang County alone selected and retained more than 30,000 seed ducks at the beginning of the year, doubling the amount of seed retained compared with last year. More than 4,000 early ducks that have been incubated throughout the district have emerged from their nests one after another.

The masses in various places have a high enthusiasm for spring hatching of poultry. Many places have automatically proposed not to kill hens, keep more good roosters, and eat less or no eggs. Jinniu Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu has already hatched more than 600 nests of poultry this year, and the survival rate of each nest is generally around 15 chicks. Various places are actively reforming incubation technology and breeding tools. Many people's communes in Chengdu, Wanxian, Neijiang, and other places have built public poultry farms and hatcheries. In Jiangyou County, Mianyang Special District, more than 130 artificial chicken incubation rooms have been established, with an average of two per commune, and each incubation room can hatch about 1,000 chicks every 30 days. The Phoenix Mountain State-owned Animal Husbandry and Horticulture Farm in the suburbs of Chengdu uses large-scale electric incubators to hatch chickens, with one box capable of incubating 10,000 eggs at a time.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th. Poultry farms in various state-run and people's communes in Heilongjiang Province are seizing the opportunity of the spring warming season to widely adopt electrical incubation and greenhouse incubation methods to hatch chicks. At present, the province's electrical and greenhouse incubation capacity has reached the point where more than 30 million chicks can be hatched per incubation cycle (21 days). Heihe Special District, the northernmost part of our country, has also broken the old habits and implemented spring hatching this year, and more than 86,000 chicks have now been hatched.

This year, in Heilongjiang Province, except for a small number of individual chicken farmers who use earthen beds and hens for incubation, more than 80% of the chicks will be hatched by electrical and greenhouse incubation stations. These incubation stations have mechanized or semi-mechanized equipment. Because electrical and greenhouse incubation stations can scientifically regulate temperature and implement dedicated management by assigned personnel, the egg hatching rate is about 30% higher than that of earthen bed incubation and hen incubation.

    家禽大发展　春孵是关键
    四川各地开展家禽春孵运动
    黑龙江广泛采用电气和温室孵化家禽
    新华社成都8日电　四川各地广泛开展家禽春孵运动。内江专区已经培训好孵化技术人员七百多名，有一百多个人工孵房投入生产，孵蛋二百多万个，已经孵出雏禽八万多只。盛产膘肥、体大、肉厚的建昌鸭的西昌专区，去年底开始就抓紧选种、留种工作。仅西昌县年初就选留种鸭三万多只，留种量比去年增加两倍。全区已经入孵的四千多个早鸭，已陆续出窝。
    各地群众春孵家禽热情很高。许多地方自动提出不杀母鸡，多留好公鸡，少吃或不吃鸡蛋。成都市郊金牛公社今年已经孵化家禽六百多窝，每窝的成活率一般都在十五只左右。各地积极改革孵化技术和饲养工具。成都、万县、内江等地许多人民公社都增建了公有养禽场、孵化场。绵阳专区江油县已建立人工孵鸡室一百三十多个，平均每个公社有两个，每个孵房三十天就可以孵出小鸡一千只左右。成都市郊凤凰山国营畜牧园艺场采用大型电孵箱孵鸡，一箱一次就可孵蛋一万个。
    据新华社哈尔滨8日电　黑龙江省各国营养鸡场和许多人民公社的养鸡场，抓紧春暖季节，广泛采用电气孵化和温室孵化的方法孵化雏禽。目前，全省电气和温室孵化的能力达到了每一个孵化周期（二十一天）能孵化雏禽三千多万只。我国最北部的黑河专区，今年也打破了老习惯实行春孵，现在已孵出雏鸡八万六千多只。
    今年，黑龙江省除少部分个体养鸡户用土炕、母鸡孵化外，80％以上的雏禽将由电气和温室孵化站孵化。这些孵化站都有机械化或半机械化设备，由于电气和温室孵化站能科学地调节温度、实行专人专责管理，孵蛋出雏率比土炕孵、母鸡孵提高30％左右。
