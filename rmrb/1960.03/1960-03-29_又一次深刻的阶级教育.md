    Another Profound Class Education
    I watched the newsreel "Class Brothers Heart to Heart" with extraordinary emotion. The film truthfully records the incident that occurred on March 4th of this year in which 125 members of the Bamafang Brigade, Dongcheng Commune, Wei County, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, suffered food poisoning and were rescued. I believe that every audience member who watches this film will deeply appreciate the greatness of our Party and the warmth of our big national family. In order to save the lives of 125 commune members, every citizen and every organization that learned of the news immediately tried every means to airdrop the special medicine to the scene of the incident in a short period of time. In a short period of time, there were doctors when needed, medicine when needed, cars when needed, and planes when needed. Most importantly, with the leadership of the Party and the people with socialist consciousness, the spirit of communist collaboration was brought into play, and the communist moral qualities of selfless devotion were promoted, contributing their strength to snatching the lives of one hundred and twenty-five class brothers from the brink of death!
    Such a major event can be quickly and truthfully seen on the screen. This has to be said to be a leap forward achievement of China's newsreel films. This also shows that photographers can invest themselves in life and struggle in a timely manner, and carry out organized and planned shooting, so that they can better exert their publicity, education, and combat role.
    I love this short newsreel, just as I love excellent newsreels such as "Ode to Heroes" and "A Million Serfs Stand Up." This film is worth watching by each and every one of us. From it, we will receive a profound education on the heart-to-heart unity and friendship of class brothers!

    又一次深刻的阶级教育
    我怀着异常感动的心情看到新闻纪录片“阶级兄弟心连心”。影片真实地纪录了发生在今年3月4日河北省张家口市蔚县东城公社八马坊大队一百二十五名社员食物中毒得到抢救的事件。我相信，每一个看过这部影片的观众，都会深深体会到我们党的伟大，我们国家这一大家庭的温暖。为了营救一百二十五名社员的生命，知道消息的每一个公民，每一个机关单位，马上想尽一切办法，在短短的时间里，把特效药空投到出事地点。在短短的时间里，要大夫有大夫，要药有药，要汽车有汽车，要飞机有飞机，而最主要的是，有党的领导，有社会主义觉悟的人们，发挥了共产主义大协作的精神，发扬了大公无私的共产主义道德品质，贡献出了自己的力量，从死亡线上夺回了一百二十五个阶级兄弟的生命！
    像这样一个重大事件，能够迅速地、真实地使我们在银幕上就能看到，这不能不说是我国新闻纪录电影的跃进成就，这里又说明，摄影师能及时投入到生活斗争中去，进行有组织有计划的拍摄，就能更好地发挥它的宣传教育和战斗作用。
    我喜爱这部短小的新闻纪录片，正如我喜爱“英雄赞”“百万农奴站起来”等优秀新闻纪录片一样。这部影片值得我们每一个人看，我们从中会受到阶级兄弟心连心、团结友爱的深刻教育！
