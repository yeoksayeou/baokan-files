    Hebei Institute of Finance and Economics Holds Academic Symposium
    Discussing Theoretical Issues of Organizing People's Economic Life

    The Trade Economics Teaching and Research Office of Hebei Institute of Finance and Economics organized an academic symposium in late February to discuss the theoretical significance of commercial departments comprehensively organizing people's economic life. The symposium first introduced the paper "On the Comprehensive Organization of People's Economic Life by Commercial Departments" written by the Teaching and Research Office, and then launched a discussion around the paper.

    The participants' speeches focused on the nature and significance of comprehensively organizing people's economic life. Some believed that comprehensively organizing people's economic life is a new development in commercial work. Marx mentioned the position of distribution and exchange in social production in "Critique of Political Economy." He pointed out that distribution and exchange are in an intermediate position between production and consumption, with production determining distribution and exchange, and distribution and exchange also having a counter-effect on production. Today's comprehensive organization of people's economic life solves the problem of how distribution and exchange can promote production and guide consumption. Others believed that although the comprehensive organization of people's economic life and the rational distribution of commodities is a good way to thoroughly implement putting politics in command and distribution according to work, the rational distribution of consumer goods is still needed even at the time of communist distribution according to need. Therefore, the comprehensive organization of people's economic life has far-reaching significance.

    Regarding the content of organizing people's economic life, the paper proposed the following four points: (1) Rationally distribute and regulate commodities, and guide consumption; (2) Assist the masses in vigorously developing service undertakings, centering on running canteens well, and comprehensively arranging people's economic life; (3) Organize the masses to develop non-staple food production and other sideline production; (4) Further improve the quality of service, strengthen the relationship between commercial departments and the masses, and truly become the "housekeepers" of the masses.

    Judging from the materials listed in the discussion, the organizational forms of comprehensively organizing people's economic life are also different due to different circumstances. Some units organize family members to engage in production and arrange economic life; some organs and enterprises organize employees to serve themselves in their spare time. In terms of the establishment of commercial networks and service points, some areas have commercial outlets that serve residents, serve factories, and serve senior intellectuals, and so on. These new works need to be further summarized and improved theoretically.

    In the discussion, some comrades also raised some issues that are worth further study, such as how to understand the nature of current commodity distribution? What role should wholesale commerce play in the comprehensive organization of people's economic life? After the emergence of this new type of commercial work, what impact will it have on the socialist mode of production and the superstructure, and so on.

    河北财经学院举行学术讨论会
    探讨组织人民经济生活的理论问题
    河北财经学院贸易经济教研室在2月下旬组织学术讨论会，探讨商业部门全面组织人民经济生活的理论意义。讨论会首先介绍了教研室所写的“论商业部门全面组织人民经济生活”的论文，接着围绕论文展开讨论。
    大家的发言集中在全面组织人民经济生活的性质及其意义上。有人认为全面组织人民经济生活是商业工作的新发展。马克思在“政治经济学批判”中提到了分配和交换在社会生产中的地位问题。他指出分配和交换处于生产和消费的中间地位，生产决定分配和交换，分配和交换对生产也有反作用。今天的全面组织人民经济生活，就是解决了分配和交换如何促进生产、指导消费的问题。也有人认为虽然全面组织人民经济生活、合理分配商品是彻底实现政治挂帅、按劳分配的一种良好形式，但合理分配消费品，到共产主义按需分配的时候也仍然是需要的。因此，全面组织人民经济生活具有深远的意义。
    关于组织人民经济生活的内容，在论文中提出以下四点：（1）合理分配与调剂商品，指导消费；（2）协助群众以办好食堂为中心，大力发展服务事业，全面安排人民经济生活；（3）组织群众发展副食品生产和其他副业生产；（4）进一步提高服务质量，密切商业部门和群众的关系，真正成为群众的“管家人”。
    从讨论中列举的材料来看，由于情况不同，全面组织人民经济生活的组织形式也不一样。有的单位组织家属进行生产，安排经济生活；有的机关企业组织职工在业余时间自我服务。在商业网和服务点的设置上，有的地区设有为居民服务的、为工厂服务的和为高级脑力劳动者服务的商业网点等等。这些新的工作，还有待于进一步从理论上总结和提高。
    在讨论中，也有的同志提出了一些值得进一步研究的问题，如怎样认识当前商品分配的性质？批发商业在全面组织人民经济生活中应发挥什么作用？这一新型的商业工作出现以后，将对社会主义生产方式和上层建筑产生什么影响等等。
