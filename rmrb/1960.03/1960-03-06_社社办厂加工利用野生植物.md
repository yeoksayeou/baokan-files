Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. The processing and comprehensive utilization of wild plants and agricultural by-products has been gradually carried out in various regions. Many places have carried out technological innovation in the process of processing and utilization, greatly enhancing the economic value of wild plants and agricultural by-products, providing commodities for the market, opening up sources of raw materials for industry, and promoting the rapid development of commune industries.

While collecting and purchasing wild plants, various regions have mobilized the masses to engage in processing and utilization on a large scale, and to process the purchased wild plants into raw materials, finished products, or semi-finished products as soon as possible. A new atmosphere of communes and brigades running factories and everyone participating in processing has emerged in many places. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, as of now, 1,004,000 various wild plant processing factories have been built in sixteen provinces (autonomous regions) including Guizhou, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang, with more than 3 million people participating in the processing.

During the vigorous "Small Autumn Harvest" campaign last year, the wild plants purchased and collected by various regions were not only large in quantity but also rich in variety, with everything available. These materials, if fully utilized, have great uses. The raw materials such as rosin, turpentine, crude saltpeter, crude alkali, synthetic petroleum, and various wild starches processed by the people's communes in the Ganzhou Special Zone of Jiangxi Province, in addition to meeting the raw material needs of the province's light industry and handicrafts, also transferred more than forty varieties to supply cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang. Shandong Province made full use of wild plants as raw materials to produce more than 7,000 tons of white wine, wild vegetable oil, and various wood pulps. Except for a few larger distilleries and famous wines whose raw materials are allocated by the state, other distilleries basically achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials.

In the process of processing and utilizing wild plants, various regions have discovered that the stalks, roots, and leaves of agricultural products also have great economic value. Experience has shown that the stalks, roots, and leaves of many plants can be used to extract oil or brew wine; some plants can both produce oil and brew wine. While promoting sesame stalk oil extraction, the Kaifeng Special Zone of Henan Province also successfully experimented with oil extraction from fifty-two varieties such as cowpea pods, peanut shells, and cotton shells. From November to December 1959 alone, 6.47 million catties of crude oil were extracted, from which more than 1 million catties of edible refined oil were extracted, and 3.81 million catties of lubricating oil for rural use and 27 million catties of oil cake were provided. 30% of the pigs in the region have been changed to feeding with feed made from sesame stalk cake, which is of great benefit to the development of pig raising.

In the processing and utilization work, many places, based on the characteristics of wild plants being scattered, widely distributed, and large in processing volume, have paid attention to implementing the principle of "relying on communes, processing locally, mainly using indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods," and adopted the method of walking on two legs, such as centralized processing and decentralized processing. Varieties with more complex technical requirements and requiring certain processing equipment, such as tannin extract, papermaking, and winemaking, are produced by factories jointly run by commercial departments and communes; varieties with relatively simple technical requirements, such as starch, fiber, pesticides, feed, and wood pulp, are organized and produced by factories of communes and production teams.

    社社办厂加工利用野生植物
    新华社5日讯　野生植物和农作物副产品的加工和综合利用工作已在各地逐步开展起来。不少地方在加工利用过程中开展了技术革新，大大发挥野生植物和农作物副产品的经济价值，既为市场提供了商品，又为工业开辟了原料来源，还促进了公社工业的迅速发展。
    各地在采集和收购野生植物的同时，发动群众大搞加工利用，尽快地把收购起来的野生植物加工为原料、成品或半成品。很多地方出现了社社办厂、人人动手搞加工的新气象。据有关部门的初步统计，到目前为止，贵州、河南、湖南、四川、安徽、浙江、黑龙江、新疆等十六个省（区）已建成各种野生植物加工厂一百万零四千个，参加加工的人数达三百多万人。
    在去年轰轰烈烈的“小秋收”运动中，各地收购和采集的野生植物不但数量大，而且品种丰富，应有尽有。这些物资只要加以充分利用，用途极大。江西省赣南专区各人民公社加工的松香、松节油、土硝、土碱、人造石油和各种野生淀粉等原料，除了满足本省轻工业、手工业的原料需要以外，还调出四十多种供应上海、北京、天津、广州、沈阳等城市。山东省充分利用野生植物做原料，生产了白酒、野生植物油、各种纸浆七千多吨。全省除几个较大酒精厂和名酒由国家拨给原料以外，其他酒厂基本上做到原料自给。
    各地在加工利用野生植物的过程中，发现农产品中的秸、根、叶也有很大经济价值。经验证明，许多植物的秸、根、叶都可以榨油或酿酒；有些植物既能出油，又能酿酒。河南省开封专区在推广芝麻秸榨油的同时，又试验成功用豆角皮、花生壳、棉花壳等五十二个品种榨油。仅1959年11月至12月就榨出毛油六百四十七万斤，从中提炼出可供食用的净油一百多万斤，还提供了农村用的润滑油三百八十一万斤，油饼二千七百万斤。全区已有30％的猪改喂芝麻秸饼配制的饲料，对发展养猪事业有很大好处。
    在加工利用工作中，许多地方根据野生植物零星分散、分布面广、加工量大的特点，注意贯彻了“依靠公社，就地加工，土法为主，土洋结合”的方针，采取集中加工与分散加工等两条腿走路的办法。把技术要求比较复杂、需要一定加工设备的品种如栲胶、造纸、酿酒，由商业部门与公社合办的工厂生产；技术要求比较简单的品种如淀粉、纤维、农药、饲料、纸浆等，组织公社与生产队的工厂生产。
