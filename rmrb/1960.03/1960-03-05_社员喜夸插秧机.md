   Commune Members Happily Praise the Rice Transplanter
  "The rice transplanter is excellent, the planted rice is as straight as brushstrokes, no back pain, no blurry vision. The Communist Party is truly great, we will always listen to Chairman Mao's words." This is the praise of the rice transplanter by the members of our brigade, and also a song of praise to technological innovation under the leadership of the Party.

    Each labor force in our brigade is responsible for more than twelve mu of land. In the past, whenever it came time to transplant rice, we were always extremely busy, wheat had to be harvested, fields had to be prepared, fertilizer had to be delivered, rice seedlings had to be transplanted... We always thought, "How great it would be if there was a machine to replace manual rice transplanting!"

    Now this ideal has been realized. The workers of our commune's agricultural machinery factory have successfully manufactured the rice transplanter, which is a great joy for us. When transplanting early rice last year, its use was promoted, and its efficiency was five or six times higher than manual transplanting.

    When transplanting late rice, one hundred and twenty rice transplanters were promoted and used throughout the brigade, and 2,600 mu of late rice were transplanted in fifteen days. This was half a month earlier than in 1958, and also saved more than 6,600 labor days. The average yield of late rice per mu was 807 jin, an increase of more than 20% compared to 1958. Now, whenever the rice transplanter is mentioned, everyone praises it and says it is good. Commune members say, "In the past, we faced the loess and turned our backs to the sky, and after the first day of transplanting, we didn't want to do it the next day." Now it is "Hands hold the machine for automatic planting, high speed and people are relaxed."

   社员喜夸插秧机
  “插秧机，顶呱呱，栽的禾，如笔画，腰不疼，眼不花。共产党，真伟大，我们永远听毛主席的话。”这是我们大队社员对插秧机的赞语，也是对党领导下的技术革新的颂歌。
    我们大队每个劳动力负担十二亩多田。过去每到插秧的时候，总是忙得不可开交，麦子要割，田要整，肥要送，秧要插……。我们总是想：“要是有个机器代替手工插秧多好啊！”
    现在这个理想实现了，我们社里农具机械厂的工人制造成功了插秧机，这是我们的大喜事。去年早稻插秧时，推广使用，比手插效率提高五、六倍。
    晚稻插秧时，全大队推广使用了一百二十部插秧机，二千六百亩晚稻，十五天时间就插完了。比1958年提早半个月，还节省了六千六百多个劳动日。晚稻平均亩产八百零七斤，比1958年增产20％以上。现在，只要提到插秧机，真是人人称赞，个个夸好。社员说：“过去脸朝黄土背朝天，插了第一天就不想第二天。”现在是“手扶机器自动栽，速度高来人轻快。”
