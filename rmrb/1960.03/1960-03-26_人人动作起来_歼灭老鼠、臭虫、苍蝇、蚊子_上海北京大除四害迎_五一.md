Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out at the enlarged meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee: Hygiene work is a major event that transforms customs and habits and transforms the world. It is beneficial to production, work, learning, and improving the people's health. Everyone must take action and carry it out vigorously. Whether old, young, youth, adults, teachers, students, men, or women, all must be drawn into the movement. Making hygienic habits and beneficial physical activities a necessity for everyone's life and a new fashion in society.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 25th: A spring patriotic health campaign of "Everyone mobilize, vigorously promote, do a great job in hygiene, and eradicate the four pests to welcome May Day" has been launched rapidly throughout Shanghai amidst the fiery high tide of technological revolution and technological innovation.

The launch of this movement is earlier than in previous years, and the momentum is great. Workers, shop assistants, students, soldiers, neighborhood residents, government cadres, and suburban farmers throughout the city are seizing the favorable opportunity before mosquitoes and flies breed in large numbers, arranging time in their tense and busy production and work, and actively engaging in the battle to eliminate rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes, and other pests. On the two Sundays of the 13th and 20th of this month, more than one million people braved the rain to search for overwintering mosquitoes and flies, clean sewers, dredge riverbanks, and vigorously accumulate fertilizer.

In this rapidly rising high tide of the patriotic health movement, many workers and residents are vigorously carrying out technological innovation, creating and trial-producing many new mechanical operation tools. Three septic tanks along the Suzhou River in Putuo District have already used drainage pipes to transport manure onto ships by gravity. Workers in Yangpu District have created a pump suction machine for collecting manure, which is forty times more efficient than manual operation. There have also been great innovations in pest control methods. Residents of Luwan District have made a dual-purpose tool for scraping and brushing sewers, which is labor-saving and efficient, and is very popular among the masses; this district has produced more than 110 new tools such as pupa exterminators and simple road sweeping and watering machines.

In order to seize this favorable situation and greatly promote the vigorous development of the patriotic health movement, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on the 24th. Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, made an important speech at the meeting. He said that hygiene work is a major event that transforms customs and habits and transforms the world. It is beneficial to production, work, learning, and improving the people's health. Shanghai's hygiene work has made considerable progress in recent years, and has created many good experiences and produced many advanced model figures. However, many cadres still lack sufficient understanding of the importance of eliminating pests and diseases and promoting hygiene, and their leadership is not strong enough. This phenomenon must be changed immediately. Ke Qingshi pointed out that this year's hygiene work must be carried out vigorously by everyone. This work must first mobilize and rely on the broad masses of the people, and whether old, young, youth, adults, teachers, students, men, or women, all must be drawn into the movement. Secondly, it must be carried out in the long term and repeatedly, and persisted in to become a habit. He pointed out that Shanghai's hygiene work must make greater achievements and realize a greater leap forward this year, making Shanghai a clean and healthy city for everyone. To this end, leading cadres at all levels should immediately conduct an inspection of the hygiene work in their departments and units, improve and fully utilize the role of patriotic health organizations at all levels, and cadres in the health departments must first of all be energized and seize the favorable opportunity before mosquitoes and flies breed in large numbers from now on, so that the movement can be launched quickly. At the same time, according to the season, several health blitz campaigns should be organized vigorously throughout the year, and all departments, units, and even every family should make a family hygiene work plan to regularize hygiene work. In vigorously promoting hygiene work, in-depth ideological education is very important. It is necessary to create strong public opinion so that everyone recognizes the importance of paying attention to hygiene, taking hygiene as an honor and not paying attention to hygiene as a shame, so that hygienic habits and the development of beneficial physical activities become a necessity for everyone's life and a new fashion in society. Ke Qingshi pointed out that the key to doing a good job in hygiene work lies in the leadership of the Party, and leading cadres of Party organizations at all levels must attach importance to hygiene work and effectively strengthen leadership over this work.

Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: A mass patriotic health campaign, centered on improving collective hygiene, environmental hygiene, dealing with mosquito and fly breeding conditions, and preventing diseases, is vigorously expanding in depth in the capital.

Now, competitions have been launched between districts, industries, streets, factories, schools, and suburban people's communes, aiming to greet International Labor Day on May 1st with a new sanitary outlook. On March 18th, at the citywide Hygiene Leap Forward Competition Conference, attended by more than 4,000 hygiene activists and responsible persons from various systems and units, nearly 100 units challenged and accepted challenges from each other. The day after the meeting, more than one million people turned out to carry out a major clean-up in various public places.

Prior to this, the city had launched a large-scale campaign to dig up fly pupae more than half a month earlier than in previous years. All districts took the initiative to contact the meteorological observatory, seized the first few days of thawing, universally investigated the pupae situation, and some districts even drew "zonal battle maps" and organized "large corps" operations. Suburban people's communes also combined pupae digging with fertilizer accumulation, excavating toilets and raising shed circles, and also rebuilt manure pools and manure ponds, creating conditions for further eliminating mosquito and fly breeding.

All districts, industries, and systems in Beijing, as well as the units that have already challenged and accepted challenges, are actively exchanging experiences and carrying out competitions. On the 23rd, young hygiene activists from industry, agriculture, commerce, schools, and the military in the city gathered and unanimously expressed their determination to be pioneers in the patriotic health movement. The Urban Service Bureau and the Non-staple Food Commercial Bureau, which are most closely related to people's lives, took action on the 19th after launching a competition on the 18th. All hotels were dismantling and washing bedding. All food stores and restaurants were overturning pots and cans and moving furniture for major cleaning and scrubbing.

Various government agencies, factories, and schools have also carried out major internal clean-ups, some combining tree planting to beautify open spaces and campuses, and some organizing to blitz-clean bedding.

Medical personnel in various districts have adapted to the new situation of the great development of street production and the collective welfare undertakings such as resident-run collective canteens, nurseries, and service stations, and vigorously helped streets train cooks, nursery workers, health workers, and cleaners to master hygiene knowledge. In the past two months alone, Dongcheng District and Xicheng District have trained more than 60,000 of these four types of personnel.

The Beijing Patriotic Health Movement Committee, the Municipal Health Bureau, and other relevant leading departments are now focusing on the central key to improving collective life—canteens and nurseries—and are preparing to hold citywide hygiene competitions for cooks, nursery workers, and child-care workers to exchange experiences in the near future. At the same time, they are organizing forces to conduct major inspections and major publicity, and will launch a citywide anti-four-pest blitz in April.

    人人动作起来　歼灭老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子
    上海北京大除四害迎“五一”
    柯庆施同志在上海市委常委扩大会议上指出：卫生工作是一件移风易俗、改造世界的大事。它有利于生产，有利于工作，有利于学习，有利于增进人民体质。必须人人动作起来，大张旗鼓地去做。无论老人、小孩、青年、壮年、教师、学生、男子、女子都要吸引到运动中来。要使卫生习惯和开展有益身心的体育活动，成为人人生活之必需，成为社会的新风尚。
    据新华社上海25日电　一个“人人动作起来，大张旗鼓，大搞卫生，大除四害，迎接五一”的春季爱国卫生运动，已在上海全市大闹技术革命、技术革新的火热高潮中同时迅速展开。
    这一运动的展开比往年为早，声势很大。全市工人、店员、学生、战士、里弄居民、机关干部和郊区农民，正抓紧当前蚊蝇尚未繁殖的有利时机，在紧张繁忙的生产和工作中，安排出时间，积极投入歼灭老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子四害和其他害虫的战斗。在本月13日和20日两个星期天，冒雨搜索越冬蚊蝇、清洗阴沟、疏浚河滨、大搞积肥的就有一百多万人。
    在这个迅速高涨的爱国卫生运动高潮中，不少工人和居民大搞技术革新，创造和试制了许多新的机械操作工具。普陀区沿苏州河的三个化粪池已经用排管自流送粪上船。杨浦区工人创造了泵浦吸粪机，效率比手工操作提高四十倍。除害方法也有很大革新。卢湾区居民自制了刮刷阴沟的两用工具，省力，效率高，很受群众欢迎；这个区已制成灭蛹机、简便扫路洒水机等新工具一百一十多件。
    为了抓住这一有利形势，大大促进爱国卫生运动的蓬勃发展，中共上海市委在24日举行了常委扩大会议。中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志在会上作了重要讲话。他说，卫生工作是一件移风易俗、改造世界的大事。它有利于生产，有利于工作，有利于学习，有利于增进人民体质。上海市的卫生工作几年来取得不少成绩，而且创造了不少好的经验，涌现了很多先进模范人物。但是，还有不少干部对除害灭病大讲卫生的重要意义认识不足，领导不够有力。这一现象必须立即改变。柯庆施指出，今年的卫生工作，必须人人动作起来，大张旗鼓地去做。这一工作首先要动员和依靠广大群众，无论老人、小孩、青年、壮年、教师、学生、男子、女子都要吸引到运动中来。其次必须长期地、反复地进行，坚持下去，成为习惯。他指出，上海市的卫生工作，今年内必须做出更大的成绩，实现更大的跃进，使上海成为一个环境清洁、人人健康的卫生城市。为此，各级领导干部应立即对本部门、本单位的卫生工作状况进行一次检查，健全和充分发挥各级爱国卫生组织的作用，卫生部门的干部首先要精神振作起来，从现在起，就要抓紧蚊蝇尚未繁殖的有利时机，使运动迅速展开。同时，应根据季节，在年内大张旗鼓地组织几次卫生突击运动，并且使所有部门、单位以至每一家庭都作出全家的卫生工作规划，使卫生工作经常化。在大张旗鼓地搞好卫生工作中，进行深入的思想教育十分重要。要造成强有力的舆论，使所有的人认识讲究卫生的重要意义，以讲卫生为光荣，不讲卫生为耻辱，使卫生习惯和开展有益身心的体育活动，成为人人生活之必需，成为社会的新风尚。柯庆施指出，搞好卫生工作，关键在于党的领导，各级党组织的领导干部一定要重视卫生工作，并切实加强对这一工作的领导。
    据新华社25日讯　以搞好集体卫生、环境卫生、处理蚊蝇孳生条件以及防治疾病为中心的群众性爱国卫生运动，在首都正大张旗鼓地向纵深扩展。
    现在各区之间、行业之间、街道、工厂、学校、郊区人民公社之间都展开了对口赛，要以新的卫生面貌迎接“五一”国际劳动节。3月18日，在全市四千多卫生积极分子和各系统、各单位负责人参加的卫生跃进竞赛大会上，有近百个单位相互挑战应战。会后第二天，就有一百多万人出动到各公共场所进行大扫除。
    在此以前，全市已经比往年提早了半个多月展开了大规模的挖蝇蛹突击运动。各区主动和气象台联系，抓紧了开冻的最初几天，普遍侦察了蛹情，有的区还绘制了“分区作战图”，组织了“大兵团”作战。郊区人民公社还把挖蛹和积肥结合进行，掏挖厕所，起垫棚圈，同时还改建粪库、粪池，为进一步消除蚊蝇孳生创造了条件。
    北京市各区、各行业、各系统以及已经挑应战的各单位之间正纷纷交流经验、开展竞赛。23日全市工、农、商、学、兵中的青少年卫生积极分子集会，一致表示要做爱国卫生运动中的先锋。和人民生活关系最密切的城市服务局、副食品商业局从18日开展竞赛后，19日就纷纷行动，各旅馆里都在拆洗被褥。各食品店、饭馆都在翻盆倒罐、搬动家具进行大扫除、大擦洗。
    各机关、工厂、学校也纷纷大扫内部，有的结合植树美化空场、校园，有的组织起来突击清洗被褥。
    各区的医务人员适应街道生产大发展，居民大办集体食堂、托儿所、服务站等集体卫生福利事业的新形势，大力帮助街道训练炊事员、保育员、卫生员、清洁员掌握卫生知识。仅东城区和西城区在近两个月中培养的四员就有六万多人。
    北京爱国卫生运动委员会、市卫生局等有关领导部门现在正大抓搞好集体生活的中心关键——食堂和托儿所等，准备在最近分别举行全市炊事员、保育员、教养员的卫生竞赛大会交流经验。同时组织力量进行大检查和大宣传，将在4月间开展全市性除四害的大突击。
