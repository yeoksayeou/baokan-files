Heroes Bind the "Sand Dragon"

Before liberation, the Baicheng Special District was a vast, boundless sandy wasteland, commonly known as the "Eight Hundred Li Dry Sea." The "Dry Sea" of that time was desolate, and the impression of desolation remained in people's minds for a long time. But if you visit here now, you will be shocked. It has completely changed and is no longer a "Dry Sea," but an oasis of abundant grain, thriving livestock, fragrant flowers, and singing birds! We drove in a car on this large plain for hundreds of miles, and looking out of the car window, we passed a protective forest belt every few miles. The protective forest belt is composed of six rows of trees linked together, all more than two people tall, stretching wide and thick into the distance, seemingly endless, like green Great Walls. The protective forest belts and networks are interwoven vertically and horizontally, and in the cultivated fields formed in the middle, one can often see windmills turning to irrigate in the spring, and commune members are busy fertilizing, preparing the land, and sowing in the fields. In the distance, on the grasslands, there are countless herds of cattle and horses. When we came here, it was early spring, and we did not encounter a single strong wind for more than a month. There was wind, but it was much smaller than in the past. People often ask strangely, "Why has the wind become smaller in recent years? Why has the weather also turned warmer?" Older people who feel it particularly deeply happily say, "Since the Communist Party came, the weather has also changed!"

Bound the "Sand Dragon"

The word "change" contains a profound meaning. Such a huge change is the result of the struggle against natural disasters by many heroes under the leadership of the Party. Whenever people talk about how to overcome wind and sand disasters here, they always talk about the Communist Party member Tian Fu. Tian Fu is the head of the forest farm in the agricultural and forestry management area of the Fuyu Town People's Commune in Fuyu County. People praise him because he works wholeheartedly for the Party and dedicates all his energy to the forestry cause and transforming nature. We passed through the dense forest belts and networks and found him on the sandy hills covered with vegetation near Xilanghe Village. This old farmer, nearly fifty years old, was holding drawings and working with technicians to measure and plan this year's afforestation work, aiming to develop towards a landscaped and orchard village.

Tian Fu told us that we were now standing on a large "Sand Dragon." In the past, whenever a strong wind blew, the flying sand filled the sky, and the "Sand Dragon" moved forward an average of fifteen meters each year, swallowing up farmland and villages. He led us to a patch of uneven ground covered with dense grass in the middle of the sand dunes and said, "This, thirty years ago, was the second site of Xilanghe Village." Tian Fu lived here with his father in his childhood. Later, the sand piled up more and more, so much that they could not open the door or cook, forcing them to abandon this village and move to the current Xilanghe Village to settle down. He pointed to a sand dune in front of him and said, "Fifty years ago, that was the first Xilanghe Village, which has long been buried by sand!" But now, this large "Sand Dragon" has been firmly bound and can no longer move!

Tian Fu said as he walked, "It is because the Communist Party came that we were able to control it." From the first day he was allocated land, he wondered how to control the "Sand Dragon." He thought: With the leadership of the Party, even the enemies have been eliminated, what is a small sand dune! So he pondered and experimented all day long. He first planted protective forests on the edge of the fields, and they all survived. Then he planted some poplars and elms on the edge of the sand dunes, but more than half of them were blown away by the spring wind the following year. But he did not lose heart and racked his brains to find a solution. One day, he suddenly remembered that in the past, people used sorghum stalk fences to block the wind and protect their gardens and fields. In the autumn, he cut some willow branches and wove a fence on the sand dunes and planted trees on the outside. The following spring, after several strong winds, Tian Fu ran to observe several times, and the woven fence blocked the wind and sand, and all the small trees survived! He excitedly ran to the district and county to report, and the government immediately sent people to help him mobilize the masses to start large-scale fence weaving and afforestation. Later, they also adopted the method of growing grass to fix the sand, spreading grass seeds everywhere to grow grass. In this way, year after year, the sand dunes became covered with vegetation, and the trees planted that year are now several meters high. Strips of forest belts and patches of grass networks tamely bound the undulating "Sand Dragon" of the past.

On the way back, Tian Fu pointed to the patches of well-tilled black oily land and said that if the wind and sand were not controlled, these lands would have been swallowed up again, but now not only are they not harmed by wind and sand, but the yield per mu is more than 221 catties. When we arrived at Xilanghe Village, we saw rows of new houses with bright and shiny glass windows, and delicate patterns were inlaid on the sides of the windows. Tian Fu said with a smile, "If the Party had not led us to control the wind and sand, we would have had to move the village again, how could we live a peaceful and prosperous life. In another five years, when this place becomes an orchard village, it will be like a paradise on earth!"

The Drought Demon Will Never Raise Its Head Again

Leaving Xilanghe Village, we went straight to Taodong Township in Taodong County to visit the legless hero Chen Wanzhong. The long-distance bus was already running on the highway in Taodong Township when we suddenly saw a hand-cranked car passing by the window. It must be Chen Wanzhong! We quickly got out of the car, and he was struggling to crank the car in the cold wind to check the production situation in each production team. We helped push the car, and along the way, the commune members greeted him cordially, and the children also rushed to help push the car. The wells in the fields on both sides of the road were really dotted like stars, and there was one not far away, some using windmills and some using animal power for spring irrigation. The ditches in the fields were connected and crisscrossed like spider webs, and water flowed continuously into the fields. Chen Wanzhong told us that the management area now has 645 wells, of which 75 are mechanized wells, with an average of about 2.5 hectares of land per well, basically realizing well network and water conservancy. He said excitedly, "Now, even if it doesn't rain for more than a hundred days, we can guarantee a good harvest, and we will no longer suffer from drought!"

Just after liberation, there was not a single well in the fields here. People never had the habit of digging wells to irrigate the land, and they relied on rain from the sky when they encountered drought. In 1951, there was a severe drought, and the land was so dry that it cracked. Not a drop of rain fell, and there was no harvest in the autumn. Chen Wanzhong, who had just returned home after recovering from injuries in the army, was determined to fight the drought to the end when he saw this situation. Under the instructions of the village Party branch, he took the lead in leading the masses to dig wells. At that time, Chen Wanzhong was the head of the mutual aid team. At night, he and the other households in the team agreed to dig a well on his land first, and everyone would share the water after it came out. The next morning, this Communist Party member, who had dedicated his legs to fighting Chiang Kai-shek, led everyone to dig the well with his crutches. He walked back and forth on his own land with difficulty and finally chose a high ridge, digging the first shovel, and everyone followed suit happily. The well was completed in six days. During the spring sowing, it was dry as soon as the crops were planted, so the mutual aid team used well water to irrigate the land, and the crops grew particularly well and yielded a good harvest. Since then, the number of wells has increased year by year, and now it is common to dig wells here, with more than a hundred wells being dug every year. Last year, the management area irrigated a large area of land, and the yield of corn, millet, sorghum, and soybeans generally increased by 500 to 1,000 catties, and the total grain output increased by more than 10% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The income of commune members has also increased a lot, and every family has savings. The total savings deposits of commune members in the entire management area reached more than 20,000 yuan.

Chen Wanzhong and other leading comrades in the management area also often study how to further promote mechanization. To achieve mechanization, he had to learn how to use machinery himself. It just so happened that the management area's gas-powered water pump technician was short of an assistant, so he volunteered to the branch to take the position. Since there was no machine room, he took the two blankets that the government had awarded him in the past to his home and built a shed to cover the machine. He pondered and fiddled with the machine in the machine room for three consecutive days, getting covered in oil, and finally started the machine. When the water poured into the fields from the large pipe, he was so happy that he said in his heart, "We must achieve mechanization as soon as possible so that the evil demon of drought will never be able to raise its head again!"

Alkali Land Becomes Fertile Land

In this remote place, formerly known as the "Dry Sea," there are many similar heroic figures. They have one common characteristic: following the guidance of the Party, they are tenacious, indomitable, and selflessly engaged in the struggle to transform nature, and no difficulty can shake their confidence. We were very excited to see the "Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains" spirit of the people in the Si Hai Management Area of the Datong People's Commune and to think about the huge soil improvement work being carried out throughout the region. The management area was still several miles away from the highway, so we walked there on foot. Along the way, we often stepped on some large blocks of land that looked like cement, shiny and hard with not a single blade of grass, which were heavy alkali blocks (the villagers called them alkali scars), and the rest of the land was also dark alkali land, sparsely growing some grass. No one would believe that such land could grow crops!

But when we approached the village, we saw such a scene: groups of male and female commune members were enthusiastically carrying soil. They dug up the thick heavy alkali soil and carried it to the open space, piling it up like small mountains; on the one hand, they poured in carts of yellow manure and black soil that had been transported from afar. Miao Zhongshan, the director of the management area, told us that they were attacking the "alkali scars" and carrying out a major soil relocation. "Alkali scars" were likened by farmers in the past to "bone-sticking carbuncles" - incurable. For thousands of years, no one had touched these leprosy-like patches of land, and they continued to spread and expand. But in 1958, when the Party issued a call to improve the soil, the entire management area was immediately mobilized to first treat the "bone-sticking carbuncles." In one spring, 42 blocks were dug and improved, and more than 600 other blocks were scraped, removing a layer of alkali cover and turning them into fertile land.

In the autumn, these "alkali scars," which had not yielded any crops in the past, grew particularly vigorously after the "digging carbuncle and filling meat" operation, and the yield was much higher than that of the neighboring good land. While digging up the "alkali scars," they also adopted the method of mixing sand and applying fertilizer to improve more than 80 hectares of light alkali land, irrigating more than 150,000 catties of black sandy soil and manure per hectare, and also obtained good harvests. Last year, they worked hard again, and the yield per unit area increased by 59% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

We visited the soil improvement exhibition hall in the management area and saw that the corn stalks grown after the soil was improved were almost twice as thick as ordinary ones. The hall displayed many statistical charts and soil improvement plans, from which it can be seen that more than 90% of the cultivated land area in the entire management area is saline-alkali land and yellow sandy land, with alkali land being the majority, and black land only accounting for 9.4%. There are a total of 710 "alkali scars," scattered throughout the cultivated land. The masses have created many methods for improving the soil, in addition to digging up "alkali scars" and mixing sand and applying fertilizer, there are also trenching to improve low-lying water-alkali soil, using alkali land to plant alkali-resistant crops, and so on. The management area has now planned to complete the transformation of all cultivated land within two years.

The barren land of many years has, in just a few years, shown a new look of "tree-lined roads on both sides of the highway, rice and grain fields in the middle of the forest network, sandy hills and bald ridges turned into green seas, and fruit tree gardens in front of and behind houses." This is an amazing miracle, and the appearance of the miracle should be attributed to the leadership of the Party and the heroic people who are capable of earth-shattering changes. At present, the struggle against wind, sand, drought, and alkali is continuing tensely, and a better future is ahead.

专栏：

    英雄缚住“沙龙”
    解放前，白城专区是一片浩瀚无垠的沙荒平原，素称为“八百里旱海”。那时的“旱海”，一片荒凉，荒凉的印象曾经长时期留在人们脑中。可是，当你现在到此一游，就会大吃一惊，它完全变了，再也不是什么“旱海”，而是粮丰畜旺和花香鸟语的绿洲！我们坐着汽车，在这个大平原上奔上百八十里，透过车窗外望，隔不几里，就有一道防护林带掠过。防护林带是由六行树并联组成，都有两人多高了，宽宽厚厚地伸向远方，极目望不到尽头，仿佛是一道道绿色长城。防护林带、林网是纵横交织的，在中间形成的畦畦良田上，不时可以看到一部部风车正在转动春灌，社员们在田野上忙着送肥、整地、播种。远处草原上，牛、马一大群一大群的数不清。我们来这里时，正是开春时节，一个多月中就没有遇见一场大风。风是有的，但比过去已经小得多了。人们常常奇怪地问：“近几年风怎么变小了？天气怎么也转暖了？”体会特别深的老年人都乐的说：“从共产党来后，天也变啦！”
    缚住了“沙龙”
    “变”这个字，包含着深刻的意义。这样巨变，是这里许多英雄好汉在党领导下，向自然灾害斗争的结果。每当人们在谈到这里如何战胜风沙灾害时，总是谈到共产党员田富。田富是扶余县扶余镇人民公社农林管理区林场场长。人们这样称颂他，是因为他忠心耿耿为党工作，把全副精力献给造林事业，改造自然。我们穿过条条如织的林带、林网，在溪浪河屯附近草木丛生的沙丘上找到了他。这个年近五十岁的老农民拿着图纸，正和技术员奔忙着测量、规划今年造林工作，要向大地园林化、花果村方向发展。
    田富告诉我们，我们现在脚踏着的正是一条大“沙龙”，过去每当大风刮起，飞沙弥空，“沙龙”平均每年向前移动十五米，吞没良田、村庄。他领着我们走到沙丘中间一片高低不平长着密草的地方说：“这里，三十年前是溪浪河屯第二个旧址。”童年的田富跟着他的父亲在这里生活过。后来沙愈堆愈多，堆的都推不开门，揭不开锅，逼得他们扔了这个屯，迁到现在的溪浪河屯安家。他指着前方的一个沙丘说：“五十年前那是第一个溪浪河屯，早已经被沙埋没掉了！”可是，现在这条大“沙龙”已被牢牢缚住，再也动弹不得了！
    田富边走边说：“这是因为来了共产党，我们才把它治住。”他从分得土地第一天起，就寻思怎样治住“沙龙”。他想：有了党的领导，敌人都被消灭了，小沙丘算个什么！于是他成天捉摸、试验。他先在田地边栽了护田林，结果都活了。跟着就到沙丘边栽些杨树、榆树，可是来年春风一刮，刮走一多半。但是他不灰心，日思夜想找办法。一天，忽然想起过去有人用夹秫秸障子挡风保园田的事。到秋天，他就砍些柳条子到沙丘上编了一趟栅，在外边栽上树。第二年春天，刮了几次大风，田富几次跑去观察，编的栅挡住了风沙，小树全部活了！他兴冲冲地跑到区、县报告，政府马上派人帮他把群众动员起来，开始大规模编栅造林。后来他们又采取养草固沙的办法，遍地扬草籽养草。就这样，年复一年，沙丘上草木丛生，当年栽的树，现在都有好几米高了。一条条林带，一片片草网，把过去起伏滚动的“沙龙”驯服地缚住了。
    在归途上，田富指着一片片翻整好的黑油油土地说，要不治住风沙，这些土地又该被吞蚀了，而现在不但不遭风沙害，每亩产量都在二百二十一斤以上。走到溪浪河屯时，我们看到一所所新屋舍，玻璃窗明亮亮地闪闪发光，窗边还嵌着细致的花纹。田富笑着说：“若不是党领导我们治住风沙，现在又要移屯了，那能过着安居乐业的生活。再过五年这里实现花果村时，就赶上人间天堂了！”
    旱魔永再抬不起头
    离开溪浪河屯，我们就直奔洮东县洮东乡去访问无脚英雄陈万忠。长途汽车已经在洮东乡的公路上奔驰，突然看见一辆手摇车在窗前掠过。这一定是陈万忠！我们赶紧下车，原来他正冒着寒风费力地摇着车到各生产队检查生产情况。我们帮着推车，沿途遇到社员们，都亲切地向他招呼，小孩也涌来帮推车。道两旁田地里的水井，真是星罗棋布，走不远就是一眼，有的用风车，有的用畜力正进行春灌。田间里沟渠相联，纵横交错像蛛网，水不绝地流到田里。陈万忠告诉我们，管理区现在已打了六百四十五眼井，其中有七十五眼是机井，平均约两公顷半地就有一眼井，基本实现了井网化、水利化。他兴奋地说：“现在就是百多天不下雨，也保丰收，再也不受旱气了！”
    刚解放时，这里田地里连一眼井也没有。人们从来没有打井灌田的习惯，遇到干旱就是靠天下雨。1951年一场大旱，地晒得裂大缝。滴雨未下，到秋颗粒不收。刚从部队伤愈复员到家乡不久的陈万忠，看到这种情景就决心向干旱斗争到底。他根据村党支部的指示，带头领导群众打井。那时，陈万忠是互助组长，夜里他和同组各户商定，先在他的地上扎眼，出水后大家分享。第二天一早，这个为了打老蒋而献出双腿的共产党员，拄着双拐领大家去打井。他困难地在自己地上走来走去，终于选了个高岗，首先挖起第一锹，大家都跟着欢干起来。干了六天水井建成。春播时，刚种上就旱，互助组就用井水浇地，庄稼长的特别好，获得了丰收。自此，水井就一年年多起来，现在这里打井已是常事，每年都打百多个井。去年，管理区灌溉大片土地，苞米、谷子、高粱、大豆普遍增产五百斤到一千斤，粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增加10％还多。社员收入也增加好多，家家都有存款，整个管理区社员储蓄存款就达二万多元。
    陈万忠还和管理区的其他领导同志经常研究如何进一步搞机械化。要机械化，自己就得学使用机械。正好管理区的煤气抽水机技工缺助手，他就向支部自报奋勇顶上去。没有机器房，就回家把政府过去奖给他的两床毛毯拿来，搭棚遮盖机器。他一连三天在机器房捉摸、摆弄，弄得满身满脸都是油污，终于把机器开动了。当水从大管口滔滔地注入田地时，他乐得心里像开了花似的说：“我们要尽快实现机械化，使干旱这恶魔永远也抬不起头来！”
    碱地变良田
    在这个边远的、过去被称为“旱海”的地方，有很多类似这样的英雄人物。他们有一个共同特点：照着党的指引，坚韧、顽强、忘我地进行改造自然的斗争，任何困难都动摇不了他们的信心。我们在大通人民公社四海管理区看到人们那种“愚公移山”的精神，想到整个地区正进行着巨大的土壤改良工作，心中十分激动。管理区离公路还有几里地，我们就徒步走去。沿途经常踏到一些像水泥似的大地块，光光硬硬的一根草也没有，这就是重碱块（老乡叫碱疤拉），其余的土地也都是暗碱地，稀稀疏疏地长些草。谁看了都不会相信这样的土地能长庄稼！
    可是当走近村头，却看到这样的情景：一群群男女社员正热火朝天地挑土、送土。他们把厚厚的重碱土挖掉，挑到空地，堆得像一座座小山似的；一面又把远处运来的一车车黄粪、黑土灌进去。管理区主任苗忠山告诉我们，他们正在向“碱疤拉”进攻，来个土壤大搬家。“碱疤拉”，过去农民把它比作“贴骨疔疮”——没治。千百年来，这些像癞疮一样的地块，就没人动过，而且还继续蔓延扩大。可是1958年，党一声号召改良土壤，全管理区马上动员起来，首先治“贴骨疔疮”，一个春天，就挖改掉四十二块，还把其他六百多块都刮层皮，挖去一层碱盖，变成了良田。
    到秋天，这些过去颗粒不收的“碱疤拉”，经过“挖疮补肉”手术后，庄稼长得特别旺盛，产量比相邻的好地还高好多。在挖“碱疤拉”同时，他们还采取混沙施肥的办法，改良了轻碱地八十多公顷，每公顷灌进黑沙土和粪达十五万多斤，也获得了良好收成。去年，他们又大干一场，单产比1958年大跃进时又增长59％。
    我们来到管理区的土壤改良展览馆中参观，看到经过改良土壤后生长的苞米秆，比一般的差不多要粗一倍。馆中陈列着许多统计图表和改良土壤规划，从中可以看出：全管理区耕地面积中，90％以上是盐碱地和黄沙地，其中又以碱地居多，黑土地只占9．4％。“碱疤拉”一共七百一十块，散布在整个耕地中。群众创造了很多改良土壤的办法，挖除“碱疤拉”，混沙施肥外，还有圈壕改良低洼水碱土、利用碱地种耐碱作物，等等。管理区现在已经规划好，要在两年内就把全部耕地改造完成。
    多少年来的不毛之地，仅仅几年间，就出现了“公路两旁林荫路，林网中间米粮川，沙丘秃岭变绿海，家前屋后果木园”的新面貌。这是惊人的奇迹，奇迹的出现要归功于党的领导和能够翻天复地的英雄人民。目前，对风沙、干旱、碱的斗争，正继续紧张地进行中，更美好的远景就在前头。
