    Letting the Water
    The Houma Commune in the suburbs of Houma City, Shanxi Province, let water to the Hengqiao Commune to irrigate wheat. Last winter, the Houma Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party assigned the Houma Commune to build a large canal fifteen *li* long. The Houma Commune felt it was somewhat difficult. At this time, the Hengqiao Commune sent reinforcements to help the Houma Commune complete the task ahead of schedule. This spring, the wheat seedlings showed signs of drought. The Houma Commune Party Committee proposed to give convenience to the Hengqiao Commune and leave the difficulties to themselves, and the water should be given to the Hengqiao Commune for irrigation first. After hearing this, the cadres of the Hengqiao Commune felt that it was unreasonable to irrigate the downstream before the upstream had been irrigated, and insisted that the Houma Commune should be irrigated first. The two communes yielded to each other. After consultation, it was decided that each would use half the flow, and the more than 8,000 *mu* of dry wheat fields on the Fenhui shoal in the Hengqiao Commune were irrigated ahead of schedule.
    When the commune members saw the clear canal water flowing into the dry wheat fields, they were all happy in their hearts and joyful in their faces. They said: The people's commune has great strength, we help them and they help us, the land gains new nutrition, and people develop new ideas. (Attached image)

    让水
    山西省侯马市郊侯马公社，把水让给横桥公社浇麦。去冬，中共侯马市委分配侯马公社修一段长十五华里的大干渠，侯马公社感到有些困难，这时横桥公社派出援兵，帮助侯马公社提前完成了任务。今年入春麦苗显出旱象，侯马公社党委提出，把方便让给横桥公社，把困难留给自己，应该把水让给横桥公社先浇。横桥公社的干部听到后，感到上游没浇下游就先浇，不尽情理，一定要让侯马公社先浇。两个公社互相推让。经过协商决定：一家用半个流量，横桥公社在汾浍滩上的八千多亩干旱麦田，得到了提前灌溉。
    社员们看见碧清的渠水流进干旱的麦田，一个个乐在心里，喜在眉头。他们说：人民公社力量大，咱帮他来他帮咱，土地增加新营养，人们成长新思想。（附图片）
