Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 16th: The "Rodong Sinmun" today published an editorial condemning the US imperialists' provocative act of launching "Matador" missiles in South Korea, a serious violation of the armistice agreement.

The editorial said that this is a heinous act of destruction of the Korean Armistice Agreement by the US imperialists and a blatant challenge to the Korean people. The Korean people are angered by the repeated provocative acts of the US imperialists and resolutely condemn their acts of sabotaging peace in Korea and the Far East.

The editorial said that the frantic war preparation schemes being carried out by the US imperialists in South Korea today show that they are pursuing their bankrupt "brink of war" policy.

The editorial said that recently, due to the extremely favorable changes in the balance of power on the international stage for socialism, US imperialism has had to talk about "peace" verbally. However, the basic policy of US imperialism has not changed. It has by no means abandoned its aggressive fantasies and hostile policies against socialist countries. US imperialism is trying to carry out war preparations behind a smoke screen of "peace" to salvage its increasingly collapsing aggressive territory.

The editorial said that today, the main purpose of US imperialism's military expansion and war preparations in South Korea is to maintain the corrupt and moribund Syngman Rhee puppet regime in order to maintain its colonial rule in South Korea.

The editorial said that the era of intimidating the people with military threats is gone forever. We are a member of the incomparably powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. If the US imperialist aggressors dare to touch a single hair of the Korean people, they will be destroyed in the flames of counterattack.

The editorial emphasized that US imperialism must pack up all its murderous weapons and get out of South Korea. Our just demands will be supported by all peace-loving people in the world. If US imperialism ignores our protests and warnings and continues to blatantly trample on the armistice agreement, it will be fully responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

"Democratic Korea" also published an editorial today, saying, "US imperialism must immediately stop the provocative missile launches and all acts that violate the armistice agreement. It must immediately take out the atomic and missile weapons and all new weapons it has brought in, and must strictly punish the masterminds related to this criminal provocative action."

    平壤报纸谴责美国在南朝鲜发射导弹的挑衅行为
    美帝国主义必须从南朝鲜滚出去
    侵略者胆敢触动朝鲜人民一根毫毛必将在反击的火焰中灭亡
    新华社平壤16日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，谴责美帝国主义严重违反停战协定、在南朝鲜发射“斗牛士”式导弹的挑衅行为。
    社论说，这是美帝国主义者对朝鲜停战协定的凶恶的破坏行为，是对朝鲜人民的公然的挑战。朝鲜人民对美帝国主义者一再的挑衅行为感到愤怒，并坚决谴责他们对朝鲜和远东和平的破坏行为。
    社论说，美帝国主义者今天在南朝鲜进行的疯狂的准备战争的阴谋活动，说明他们在追求破了产的“战争边缘”政策。
    社论说，最近由于国际舞台上力量对比关系发生了极其有利于社会主义的变化，美帝国主义不得不在口头上谈论“和平”，但是，美帝国主义的基本政策并没有改变，它绝没有放弃反对社会主义阵营国家的侵略妄想和敌对政策。美帝国主义妄想在“和平”的烟幕后面进行备战活动来挽救它日益崩溃的侵略地盘。
    社论说，今天，美帝国主义在南朝鲜进行扩军备战的主要目的就是为了保持腐朽透顶的李承晚傀儡政权，以维持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治。
    社论说，以军事威胁来吓唬人民的时代已经一去不复返了，我们是以苏联为首的强大无比的社会主义阵营的一员，如果美帝国主义侵略者胆敢触动朝鲜人民一根毫毛，它将在反击的火焰中遭到灭亡。
    社论强调说，美帝国主义必须收拾起一切杀人武器从南朝鲜滚出去。我们的正当主张将受到全世界所有爱好和平人民的支持。如果美帝国主义不顾我们的抗议和警告，继续粗暴地蹂躏停战协定，它就要对由此引起的一切后果负全部责任。
    “民主朝鲜报”今天也发表社论说，“美帝国主义必须立即停止挑衅性的发射导弹和一切违反停战协定的行为，必须立即带着运进来的原子和导弹武器以及一切新式武器滚出去，还必须严格处罚同这一犯罪性的挑衅行动有关的主谋者。”（附图片）
