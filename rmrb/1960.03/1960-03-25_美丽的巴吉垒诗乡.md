Beautiful Poetry Village of Bajilei
By our reporter Bai Sheng

    Bajilei, oh, what a wonderful place!
    The car sped along the highway from Changchun to Ulanhot. Along the way, the white snowscape reflected the boundless wilderness of the Songliao Plain. The morning breeze entered the car window, making one feel the bursts of coldness of early spring in the north. After a brief stop in Gucheng, Nongan County, northwest of Changchun, the car sped directly northwest towards Nongan, and about sixty miles from Gucheng, Nongan, we arrived at the flag township of mass cultural activities in Jilin Province—the beautiful Bajilei.
    Bajilei, this is truly a beautiful and rich place: in the distance, horses gallop on the grasslands, cattle and sheep graze on the hillsides and meadows, the fields exude the fragrance of the earth, and the hardworking people of Bajilei are busy in the fields.
    What a wonderful place! When we met with Liang Wanguo, the first secretary of the Bajilei Commune Party Committee, this simple rural cadre enthusiastically introduced us to the tremendous changes that had taken place in this beautiful place. In the past, the people of Bajilei used to sing a folk song: "Bajilei, oh, what a poor place, the land is barren and the mountains are desolate." But since liberation, this place has gradually changed its face, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, everything here has undergone earth-shattering changes. In this area of fifty square miles, with a population of 24,000, the people are full of energy, sorghum and corn are harvested in abundance year after year, the ponds are deep with fresh fish, and there is an abundance of crucian carp, cattails, and reeds. Every household in the villages is studying culture. What you will admire most is that the people of Bajilei are reciting poetry and painting everywhere during the years of good harvest. The people of Bajilei are singing about the changes in their hometown like this:

    Orchards become forests, willows in rows, poor land becomes a land of fish and rice.
    The machines in the factories roar, cattle and sheep graze on the hillsides and meadows.
    No quarrels are heard in the village, poetry and colorful paintings fill the streets.
    Abundant harvests are celebrated together, thousands of poems and paintings praise the Party.
    In Bajilei, we saw some people who could all write poetry and exchange verses with each other. In order to express their joy and happiness after the communization and to improve production, writing poetry has become a common practice in the countryside. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the working people of Bajilei, with a fiery enthusiasm, launched a literary and artistic creation movement in order to promote production. The feelings and talents of the simple farmers, like wild horses, roamed freely on the joyful grasslands. Their poems, thousands upon thousands, all sang the praises of the beautiful changes in their hometown. Listen:

    Mountains covered with forests of green, blue skies and green waters matched with red flowers.
    Wind, sand, water, and drought will never be seen again, only peach and plum blossoms smile in the spring breeze.
    Bajilei, oh, what a wonderful place, changing the old face and putting on new clothes.
    Industry and agriculture leap forward together, ten thousand poems praise the hometown.
    The farmers of the Bajilei Commune told us affectionately that when the poetry craze prevailed, the secretary of the Commune Party Committee also took the lead in writing enthusiastic poems in his busy schedule:

    For thousands of years in feudal society, poor people had no right to study.
    The people turned over and learned culture, thanks to the Party's leadership.
    The era of the commune is extraordinary, and the peasants have jumped onto the literary stage.
    Writing poems in thousands of volumes, sages emerge from among the roughnecks.
    Many ordinary rural women have also learned to write poetry. Han Yushu, a mother of four, used to be illiterate, but now she has become literate and was elected as the women's production team leader after the communization. This clever woman has written many folk songs in more than a year to express her happy feelings. Her poems are full of life and real emotions:

    Autumn breeze is cool in autumn, sorghum is red and millet is yellow.
    Male and female commune members are busy harvesting, bringing grains home to fill the barns.
    Everyone is singing songs, thanking the Communist Party in every voice.

The Talent of the Peasant Poets
    On the afternoon of our visit to the Bajilei Commune, Secretary Liang of the Commune Party Committee introduced us to two outstanding and poetically gifted peasant poets, Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Wenxiu.
    Wang Zhenhai, thirty-eight years old, used to work as a long-term laborer and drove carts for the landlord. This simple, hardworking peasant, who had only studied for two and a half years in his childhood and learned some culture after liberation, wrote many surprisingly good poems. He told us: one night, he and the young men of the production team were harrowing the land together. The joyful mood and soaring enthusiasm of the people during the night battle inspired him from the bottom of his heart to write a beautiful poem reflecting the spirit of the Great Leap Forward of the peasants:

    Singing mountain songs and shaking whips, hearts as sweet as honey, harrowing the land happily.
    The whip sweeps away the moon on the horizon, harrowing away and leveling thousands of mountains.
    In the conversation, he also enthusiastically recited a short poem depicting his different moods in the two eras before and after liberation:

    In the past, I was a bitter person, now I have turned over and become the master.
    Realizing the commune, I have become a happy person.
    Of course, writing poetry is not easy for Wang Zhenhai. In the process of writing poetry, he studied hard. Whether during breaks from working in the fields, or in the early morning, or sitting under the lamp in the evening, he studied and researched diligently. He himself has a poem describing:

    In the morning, a farmer in the field, in the evening, a student in college.
    Fortunate to wield the golden hoe during the day, wielding the pen under the lamp at night.
    The clever Wang Zhenhai, under the cultivation and help of the Party, started by writing short poems, then practiced writing long poems, then wrote seven-character and five-character poems, and then practiced writing new poems. He also wrote lyrics and dramas. For example, the work "Competing for a Foal" describes a couple on the road before a rain, competing to take the foal born on the road back to the commune, reflecting the collectivist spirit of the broad masses of commune members loving the commune as their home after the communization.
    As we were chatting happily with Wang Zhenhai, a young girl with two beautiful braids, a tall and strong figure, and rosy cheeks walked in. Secretary Liang of the Commune introduced us to Zhang Wenxiu of the commune. She is twenty years old this year and is the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Mobo Management Area of the Bajilei Commune, a versatile poet, and also a production expert. In her conversation with us, her bright eyes flashed with intelligence from time to time.
    She talked to us naively about the jokes she made when she first started writing poetry. She had only studied for three years in elementary school. When many people in the township were writing poetry and painting to promote production during the Great Leap Forward, she didn't know what poetry was, but she also enthusiastically wrote a poem, one sentence of which was: "Holding a hoe, I shovel happily." She took the poem to show everyone and recited it to everyone. Everyone laughed after hearing it, and she thought everyone was laughing at how well she had written the poem. Later, she recited the poem to Wang Zhenhai, and Wang Zhenhai slapped his thigh and said with a smile, "You are really energetic! Can you do deep plowing with a hoe?" She asked Wang Zhenhai how to write poetry, and Wang Zhenhai said: "Writing poetry can be figurative, or it can be exaggerated, but it must be based on facts...." Only then did she realize that writing poetry not only had to rhyme, but more importantly, it had to be true. If she said that she was doing deep plowing with a hoe, wouldn't that be a joke?
    After that, she studied hard and finally produced an endless source of poetry in her labor practice. Like Wang Zhenhai, she loves life and loves her hometown. Her poems are very cheerful and lively:

    Trees are green, grass is green, men and women go to spring plowing in teams.
    The "Eight-Character Charter" is well implemented, and there will be a great harvest of grains in autumn.
    This poem makes people feel very fresh after reading it.

Moving Poetry Competition
    The night gradually fell, the spring night in March! In this remote north, in the land of Bajilei, the poetry village, our peasant poets are using their simple poetic language to sing the praises of the beautiful and happy life of the motherland. Two bright carbide lamps illuminated the room of Liang Wanguo, the first secretary of the Bajilei Commune Party Committee. Here, the poets, who had just returned from laboring in the fields, walked into the small poetry competition venue with joyful moods. A unique poetry competition on the kang was opened with beautiful poems.
    You may not believe it, but these simple peasants with tanned faces and calluses on their hands, who were just working in the fields, are now, look, each of them holding paper and pens, sitting quietly on the kang thinking. After only a moment of thought, they recited the poems they had just written one by one. The young peasant Liu Xingquan took the lead and fired the first shot. Look, how enthusiastic and forthright this young man is, he sings aloud the poem he just wrote:

    The east wind blows vigorously and hundreds of flowers bloom, distinguished guests come to our commune this evening.
    Preparing flowers and wine to welcome the guests, I write a rough poem to express my feelings.
    His simple and pure feelings deeply moved every fiery heart at the poetry competition. His poem had not yet ended, and immediately the second and third... people who recited their works burst out. The recitation of Yin Xuerong, a young salesperson from the supply and marketing cooperative, brought people to such a beautiful poetic realm! In a corner of the kang, I saw Zhang Wenxiu quietly gazing and meditating. After another peasant, Wang Dianbing, enthusiastically recited his welcome poem, Zhang Wenxiu stood up in a hurry. She—began to recite her poem in her rhythmic and emotional voice:

    I sit on the edge of the kang, poets one by one,
    Everyone looks at each other and feels happy
    That's right.
    The room is full of poems, everyone smiles,
    Every sentence is pleasant and good to hear.
    The lights are bright and dazzling, bursts of laughter do not stop,
    Everyone's heart is excited, happy and cheerful to spit out envy.
    The beautiful sound of poetry is noisy, but I am silent,
    I feel ashamed that I am too shallow to compile it.
    If I don't open my mouth again, I will be ashamed, forcing my heart to shatter,
    I will never fall behind in speaking poetry and singing, I will learn.
    What a moving poem! Zhang Wenxiu's poems touched everyone's hearts and made people unable to calm down for a long time. Seeing that the young people were all rushing to be first, Pan Weimin, a forty-three-year-old peasant, was not behind either. He stood up and enthusiastically recited his poem praising the commune:

    The people's commune is a flower, the flower blooms thousands of miles and its fragrance fills thousands of homes.
    The system is superior and the direction is good, every family happily praises the commune.
    Seeing the middle-aged peasant Pan Weimin reciting his poem, Qu Hongfu, a peasant from the Taihe Management Area of Bajilei, was not behind either. He also recited his work in one breath:

    Every fresh flower blooms in spring, every fresh flower is every heart.
    Blessing Chairman Mao with all my heart, surpassing the longevity of pine and cypress.
    At this time, Gao En, the ballad writer of the commune, could not restrain his boiling mood. He used three teacups to set up a small drum on the table, and lightly tapped it rhythmically while singing a poem:

    Happy to meet at the poetry competition, everyone's heart is like a red fire.
    Men sing and women sing together in a leap forward, and grain production climbs to a peak.
    The poetry competition was really a scene of poetic ripples, and everyone was in high spirits. Here, the poetry reciting of the poets of the Begonia Poetry Society in "Dream of the Red Chamber" would also be inferior.
    The spring night was already deep, and we still had to travel sixty miles to return to the county committee. At this time, Secretary Liang of the Commune Party Committee had to announce the temporary end of the poetry competition. But the group of enthusiastic, simple, and emotionally rich poets were still in the midst of poetic inspiration. They revealed a deep affection for parting, and finally asked Zhang Wenxiu to recite the farewell poem on their behalf:

    Distinguished guests! Distinguished guests!
    After a moment of being together,
    We are about to part,
    Our excited hearts!
    Do not want to part.
    You have brought us the east wind and drizzle from afar,
    Brought us the spring of Beijing,
    The people of Bajilei will always remember it in their hearts.
    Parting this evening,
    When will we meet again,
    Wishing you on the long road,
    Take care! Take care.
    Although we cannot be there in person,
    But our fiery hearts,
    Will always accompany you,
    Flying to Changchun,
    Flying to Beijing!

    美丽的巴吉垒诗乡
    本报记者　柏生
    巴吉垒呀好地方
    汽车在长春至乌兰浩特的公路上疾驰。沿路白皑皑的雪景，掩映着松辽平原无垠的旷野。晨风透进车窗，使人感到北国早春阵阵寒意。车在长春西北农安县古城停留片刻后，又直向农安西北方向奔驰，约行至离农安古城六十华里的地方，便来到吉林省群众文化活动的红旗乡——美丽的巴吉垒。
    巴吉垒，这真是个美丽富饶的好地方：远处，骏马飞驰在草原上，牛羊在山坡草甸上牧放，田野里散发着一片大地的芬芳，勤劳的巴吉垒人民正在田野里奔忙。
    多么美好的地方啊！当我们和巴吉垒公社党委第一书记梁万国一见面，这位淳朴的农村干部，便热情地为我们介绍了这个美丽地方的今昔巨变。以前巴吉垒的人们口中流传着这样一首民歌：“巴吉垒呀穷地方，土地瘠薄山荒凉”。但解放以后，这里逐渐改变了面貌，特别是1958年大跃进以后，这里的一切都起了翻天复地的大变化。在这方圆五十里的地方，共有二万四千人口，人民干劲冲天，高粱玉米连年丰产，泡塘里水深鱼鲜，盛产着大量的鲫鱼、蒲草和芦苇。村舍里家家户户都在学文化。最令你羡慕的是巴吉垒人民在丰收年中到处吟诗和绘画。巴吉垒人民这样歌颂着自己家乡的变化：
    果树成林柳成行，穷地变成鱼米乡。
    工厂机器隆隆响，山坡草地皆牛羊。
    屯中不闻争吵语，诗歌彩画满街坊。
    五谷丰登齐欢唱，千诗万画歌颂党。
    在巴吉垒，我们看到的一些人们，他们大都能出口成章，诗来诗往。人们为了抒发公社化后欢乐幸福的心情，更好地搞好生产，写诗已经成了一种乡风。在大跃进的1958年中，巴吉垒劳动人民，为了推动生产，以火一般的热情，开展了文艺创作活动。淳朴农民的感情和才华，像脱缰之马，自由驰骋在欢乐的草原。他们的诗歌，千首万首，首首都歌颂着家乡的美好变化。你听：
    漫山树海一片青，蓝天绿水配花红。
    风沙水旱永不见，只见桃李笑春风。
    巴吉垒呀好地方，改变旧貌换新装，
    工农各业齐跃进，诗歌万首颂家乡。
    巴吉垒公社的农民亲切地告诉我们，当诗风盛行时，公社党委书记也在百忙中带头写了热情的诗篇：
    封建社会几千年，穷人那有读书权。
    人民翻身学文化，多亏党来领导咱。
    公社年代不平凡，农民一跃上文坛。
    挥笔成诗千万卷，老粗当中出圣贤。
    许多普通的农家妇女，也学会作诗。四个孩子的妈妈韩玉书，过去一字不识，现在脱了盲，在公社化后被选为妇女生产队长。这个聪明的妇女为了抒发自己的欢乐心情，一年多的时间编写了许多首民歌。她的诗充满了生活的气息和真实的感情：
    秋季里来秋风凉，高粱红来谷子黄。
    男女社员收割忙，颗粒还家堆满仓。
    人人都把歌儿唱，声声感谢共产党。
    农民诗人的才华
    在我们访问巴吉垒公社的那天下午，公社党委梁书记为我们介绍了两位才华出众，诗情横溢的农民诗人王振海和张文秀。
    三十八岁的王振海，过去一直给地主扛大活，赶大车。这个朴实勤劳，幼年只念过两年半书，解放后才学了些文化的农民，写出不少令人惊讶的好诗。他和我们谈起：一天夜里，他和生产队的小伙子们一起耙地，夜战中人们欢乐的心情和冲天的干劲，使他从内心激发出一首反映农民大跃进气魄的美丽的诗篇：
    口唱山歌手摇鞭，心甜如蜜耙地欢。
    鞭儿扫落天边月，耙走切平万座山。
    在谈话中，他又热情地为我们朗诵了一首描绘他自己在解放前后两个时代不同心情的短诗：
    从前是苦人，翻身作主人。
    实现公社化，变成幸福人。
    当然，作诗对王振海来说，并不是简单的，在他写诗的过程中，是经过刻苦地学习的。无论是在田间劳动之余，还是清晨，抑是晚间坐在灯下，他都苦苦学习和钻研。他自己有诗描绘说：
    朝为田间郎，暮登大学堂。
    日幸挥金锄，灯下舞笔枪。
    聪明的王振海，在党的培养和帮助下，从写短诗开始还练习了写长诗，从写七言五言诗，又练习写新诗。还写唱词和戏剧。如作品“争马驹”，是描写一对夫妻在落雨前的路途上，争着要把生在路上的小马驹抱回公社，体现了公社化后，广大社员爱社如家的集体主义思想。
    我们正在和王振海欢谈，门外走进来一位梳着两条美丽的发辫，高高结实的身材，红润润面颊的年轻姑娘。公社梁书记为我们介绍说这就是公社里的张文秀。她今年二十岁，是巴吉垒公社莫波管理区团支部书记，一位多才的诗人，也是生产上的能手。在她和我们谈话中，明亮的双眸中不时闪动着聪慧的光芒。
    她稚气地和我们谈起她最初写诗时闹的笑话来。她只念过三年小学。当大跃进中，乡里许多人写诗作画推动生产时，她虽然不懂什么叫诗，但自己也热情地写了一首，其中有一句是：手拿锄头铲的欢。她拿诗给大家看，并朗诵给大家听。别人听后都哈哈大笑，她以为大家是笑她这首诗写的好。后来她把诗又念给王振海听，王振海听了也拍腿笑着说：“你这干劲可真足啊！拿锄头还能搞深翻吗？”她请教王振海怎么写诗，王振海说：“写诗可以形容，也可以夸张，但是总得用事实做基础啊……。”这时她才认识到写诗不仅要押韵，更重要的是要真实，如果像她说的那样用锄头深翻，岂不成了笑话吗？
    这以后她勤学苦练，终于在劳动实践中产生了无尽的诗源。她和王振海一样，热爱生活、热爱家乡。她的诗很开朗也很活泼：
    树儿绿，草儿青，男女结队去春耕。
    “八字宪法”执行好，秋后五谷大丰登。
    这首诗使人读了感到十分清新。
    感人的赛诗会
    夜幕渐渐地拉下来，3月的春夜啊！在这遥远的北方，巴吉垒诗乡的土地上，我们的农民诗人正用那淳朴的诗的语言，歌颂着祖国美好幸福的生活。两盏明亮的汽灯照亮了巴吉垒公社党委第一书记梁万国的房间。这里，才从田野里劳动归来的诗人们，个个带着欢笑的心情，走进了小小的赛诗会场。一个别有风味的炕头赛诗会，就在美好的诗篇中揭开了序幕。
    你也许不会相信，就是这些面孔晒得黑黝黝，手上打起了茧子的朴实的农民们，他们刚才还在田野里劳动，现在，你看，他们个个手拿着纸笔，坐在炕头上静静地沉思，才只片刻的思考，他们便一一朗诵起自己刚刚编就的诗篇。那年轻的农民刘兴权一马当先打了头一炮。你看，这小伙子够多么热情豪爽，他高吟着自己才刚编就的诗篇：
    东风盛吹百花开，贵宾今夕我社来。
    迎宾备设花和酒，我作粗诗表心怀。
    他质朴纯真的感情，深深地感动了赛诗会上颗颗火热的心。他的诗还没有落音，立刻又迸发出第二个第三个……朗诵自己作品的人。那供销社年轻的营业员尹学荣的朗诵，把人们带到了多么美好的诗的意境啊！在炕沿的一角，我看到了张文秀正静静地凝眸沉思。当又一位农民王殿炳热情地朗诵了自己的迎宾诗后，张文秀匆匆地站了起来，她，——开始用自己那有节奏有感情的声音，朗诵了自己的诗篇：
    我在炕沿坐，诗人一个个，
    大家相视心里乐
    不错。
    满屋诗歌声，人人笑盈盈，
    句句都是悦耳声好听。
    灯光辉煌夺目，阵阵欢笑不住，
    人人心房激动，畅心又欢吐羡慕。
    诗歌美妙声喧，我却默默无言，
    自感才浅不能编羞惭。
    再不张嘴自愧，逼得我心房碎，
    说诗唱歌决不后坠，学会。
    多么感人的诗篇啊！张文秀的诗篇句句打动了人们的心，使人们许久不能平静。看到年轻人个个抢先，四十三岁的农民潘维民也不落后，他站起身来，热情地朗诵出那歌颂公社的诗篇：
    人民公社一朵花，花开千里香万家。
    制度优越方向好，家家幸福把社夸。
    看到了中年农民潘维民朗诵了自己的诗篇，巴吉垒太和管理区的农民曲洪福也不落后，他也一气吟罢了自己的作品：
    棵棵鲜花开在春，棵棵鲜花颗颗心。
    心心祝福毛主席，胜过松柏万年春。
    这时，公社的鼓曲作家高恩也实在按耐不住自己沸腾的心情，他用三个茶杯在桌上架起了一面小鼓，一面有节奏地轻声敲打，一面唱起诗来：
    赛诗会上喜相逢，人人心中似火红。
    男歌女唱齐跃进，粮食产量攀高峰。
    赛诗会场上真是一片诗意荡漾，人人情绪激昂。在这里，“红楼梦”中海棠诗社的诗人们的诵诗也将为之逊色了。
    春夜已经深了，我们还要赶行六十里路程，回到县委会去。这时，公社党委梁书记只好宣布赛诗会暂时结束了。但那一群热情淳朴，感情洋溢的诗人们诗兴正浓，他们流露着依依惜别的深情，最后终于请张文秀代表他们朗诵了话别的诗篇：
    贵宾！贵宾！
    相处一刹，
    就要离分，
    我们激动的心啊！
    不愿离分。
    您遥远地给我们带来了东风细雨，
    给我们带来了北京的春天，
    巴吉垒的人民将永记在心。
    今夕离分，
    何时再临，
    祝您在那千里迢迢的路途上，
    保重！保重。
    我们虽不能身临，
    但我们这颗火热的心，
    将一直伴随着您们，
    飞往长春，
    飞往北京！
