Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Foreign Minister Chen Yi wrote to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on March 15th, replying to his letter of January 23rd regarding the Overseas Chinese issue. The full text of Foreign Minister Chen Yi's reply is as follows:

To His Excellency Dr. Subandrio, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta:

I have received Your Excellency's letter of January 23, 1960. I am pleased to note that Your Excellency, on behalf of the Indonesian government, has once again expressed the desire to resolve the Overseas Chinese issue on the basis of mutually consolidating friendly relations. Our two countries have now exchanged instruments of ratification of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality and have established a joint committee to implement the treaty. Negotiations are also underway between the two sides regarding the repatriation of Overseas Chinese, and the first group of Overseas Chinese transported by ships sent by the Chinese government has returned to China. These facts indicate that a good start has been made towards a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue, and as long as both sides cooperate sincerely and continue to overcome existing difficulties, the Overseas Chinese issue can be gradually resolved fairly and reasonably.

As Your Excellency knows, the Chinese government has consistently adopted a positive attitude towards resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. The Chinese government has always hoped that Overseas Chinese with dual nationality can smoothly choose Indonesian nationality in accordance with the principle of voluntariness, and that those Overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality can continue to reside in Indonesia with their legitimate rights and interests respected, and contribute to the local economic development. After the anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities against Chinese emerged in Indonesia, the Chinese government, still prioritizing the friendship between the two countries, put forward suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue in accordance with its consistent stance. The positive role played by Overseas Chinese in Indonesia's economic development has been beyond doubt. However, given that the Indonesian government emphasizes that the Overseas Chinese are no longer compatible with Indonesia's economic development, and that in fact a considerable number of Overseas Chinese have been forced to lose their livelihoods and are in dire straits, the Chinese government believes that it is necessary to include the issue of repatriating those Overseas Chinese who cannot make a living in Indonesia and are unwilling to continue residing there in the proposal for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue. This is a major effort made by the Chinese government to break the deadlock on the Overseas Chinese issue. The Chinese government has repeatedly requested the Indonesian government to be responsible for repatriating the Overseas Chinese back to China based on the principle of voluntariness, and has made preparations for receiving and resettling the returning Overseas Chinese. When the Indonesian government indicated that providing ships was temporarily difficult, the Chinese government took the initiative to send ships to transport Overseas Chinese back to China. These facts fully demonstrate the Chinese government's sincerity in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue.

The Indonesian government has repeatedly stated that it will not obstruct Overseas Chinese who wish to return home and will do its best to assist them; the Chinese government welcomes this. However, the recent difficulties encountered by returning Overseas Chinese in Indonesia cannot but cause us concern. Some Overseas Chinese who want to return home have been prevented from leaving their residences or "reception centers," and some have encountered various difficulties on their way to and after arriving at the assembly ports. The belongings of returning Overseas Chinese, including daily necessities, are subject to many restrictions. The exit inspection of returning Overseas Chinese is a normal procedure, but sometimes it has become a deliberate obstruction to the departure of Overseas Chinese. I do not think these situations occur out of the wishes of the Indonesian government leaders. However, these situations are facts and have already caused serious anxiety among the Overseas Chinese. It is naturally painful for Overseas Chinese to be forced to discontinue residing in Indonesia, where they have lived for generations, and not be able to return to their motherland smoothly. The Chinese government hopes that the Indonesian government will take measures to quickly improve this situation so that Overseas Chinese who wish to return home can realize their wishes as soon as possible.

At present, a large number of Overseas Chinese are requesting to return home, and the repatriation of Overseas Chinese is a complex task. The Chinese government believes that it is necessary for both sides to make overall and appropriate arrangements for this work. Ambassador Huang Zhen, on behalf of the Chinese government, has made the following requests to the Indonesian government regarding the repatriation of Overseas Chinese: (1) Stop forced evictions and other persecution activities against Overseas Chinese, stop concentrating Overseas Chinese in designated locations, and request the Indonesian government to give Overseas Chinese a certain period of time to make choices, either to relocate or to return home, in the implementation of its relevant laws concerning Overseas Chinese; (2) Release all Overseas Chinese who have been detained during the eviction process; (3) For Overseas Chinese who have been evicted and concentrated, request the Indonesian government to take care of their lives and compensate for their losses; (4) For Overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods or are unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia, request the Indonesian government to assist them in going to designated ports to assemble, waiting to be repatriated back to China, and ensure their safety on the way to the ports and be responsible for their food and accommodation at the ports; (5) Allow Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return home to sell their property, allow them to bring back their funds and belongings, and allow dismissed Overseas Chinese workers to take all their wages and severance pay back to China; (6) Request the Indonesian government to quickly arrange ships to repatriate the above-mentioned Overseas Chinese back to China in batches, and ensure the safety of Overseas Chinese on their way home. I am pleased to learn that Your Excellency has stated that the above-mentioned requests of the Chinese government are constructive opinions and can be used as the basis for resolving the issue of repatriating Overseas Chinese back to China. The Chinese government suggests that the two sides reach an agreement on the repatriation of Overseas Chinese back to China as soon as possible through consultations on the basis of the above-mentioned requirements. If the Indonesian government still has difficulties in providing ships at present, the Chinese government is willing to continue to send ships to transport Overseas Chinese back to China, and will notify the Indonesian government of the departure date of the ships as soon as possible so that the Indonesian government can make advance arrangements to avoid unnecessary delays for Overseas Chinese returning home. We hope that through the cooperation of both sides, the repatriation of Overseas Chinese back to China will proceed smoothly, thereby creating favorable conditions for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue.

China and Indonesia are two friendly countries, and the friendship between the two peoples is long-term. The unfavorable situation for the friendship between the two countries that is currently emerging on the Overseas Chinese issue is only temporary. The exchange of letters between Your Excellency and me has already enabled the two countries to find some common ground in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. We believe that as long as both sides abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and conduct friendly consultations in earnest, the ongoing negotiations between our two countries will progress smoothly, the Overseas Chinese issue can be expected to be resolved comprehensively and reasonably at an early date, and the friendly relations between the two countries will surely be maintained and developed.

Please accept my highest regards.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

Appendix: Reply from Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on January 23, 1960, to Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter of December 24, 1959.

To His Excellency Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China,

Your Excellency:

I have received Your Excellency's letter of December 24, 1959, and have carefully studied its contents.

I am very pleased that, on the whole, the contents of the above-mentioned letter contain materials that can be used as a basis for seeking points of contact. At the same time, the tone of the letter also contains a friendly spirit.

It is not surprising that we, as sovereign and independent states, hold different positions on a number of issues, particularly on issues that must be resolved regarding the legacy of colonialism. On this issue, the determination of the Indonesian government and people is that everything must be resolved without prejudice to the mutual respect and the desire to mutually consolidate friendly relations. In responding to Your Excellency's letter, the Indonesian government and people have affirmed their position on the above-mentioned basis.

The Indonesian government does not intend to continue the debate in correspondence, as Your Excellency also proposed in your letter of December 24, 1959. However, for the necessary explanation, it is beneficial for the Indonesian government to make further clarifications on the various issues raised by Your Excellency in the letter.

Regarding the issue of the dual nationality treaty, the Indonesian government hereby reiterates its willingness to exchange instruments of ratification as soon as possible after the government of the People's Republic of China expresses its consent. Since August 1959, the Indonesian government has been waiting for such an expression of approval from the People's Republic of China.

In Your Excellency's letter, as pointed out in the main content of the letter, Your Excellency mentioned that the Indonesian government unilaterally formulated regulations for the implementation of the dual nationality treaty in the form of Government Regulation No. 20 of 1959.

Please allow me to explain here that, according to the actual practice of Indonesian legislation, every law approved by the parliament, including laws relating to treaties, must subsequently formulate a government regulation on the implementation of the instructions.

The Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia stipulates that the formulation of such regulations is a power exercised by the Indonesian government in accordance with its sovereignty. Of course, the Indonesian government does not prejudice the sovereignty of the relevant foreign government when formulating such regulations. In the view of the Indonesian government, the government regulations on the implementation of the laws relating to dual nationality do not infringe on the above-mentioned sovereignty. Regarding the issue of exceptions stipulated in Government Regulation No. 20 of 1959, I would like to state that the exchange of letters between Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and Premier Zhou Enlai gives the Indonesian government the right to unilaterally stipulate which categories of people can be considered to have only Indonesian nationality based on their political and social status.

Regarding the issue of the joint committee, I have designated Susanto Tirtoprodjo, Bachelor of Laws, as the Indonesian representative on the joint committee. It is hoped that this joint committee will successfully facilitate the smooth implementation of the dual nationality treaty in the future.

Your Excellency's letter mentioned in detail the various hardships of the Overseas Chinese caused by the implementation of the regulations of the Indonesian government. In order to verify it personally, I found it necessary to inspect the West Java area. During the inspection of this area, I carefully studied the various situations caused by the implementation of Presidential Regulation No. 10 of 1959 on the abolition of alien small traders and retailers outside the county seat and Central War Authority Regulation No. 1959/PPU/039 on prohibiting aliens from residing outside the county seat. It is beneficial for me to point out again clearly that this ban does not contain discriminatory characteristics, because other aliens, such as Pakistani, Indian, Dutch, Arab, American, and other expatriates are also included.

The purpose of this inspection was not merely to see those pleasant things, but to conduct a comprehensive inspection and understand in what areas it is necessary to take measures to improve the local situation.

One of the facts I obtained during the inspection is that the Overseas Chinese who are prohibited from doing business and residing can be divided into three categories.

The first category is those who have voluntarily complied with the regulations on the Indonesian side and transferred their business from the countryside to the county seat. After the promulgation of the above-mentioned regulations, most of these Overseas Chinese immediately obtained appropriate accommodation and livelihood, and many of them have successfully transferred their business from the countryside to the county seat in just a few months. In this matter, they received much help from the local government.

The second category is those who delayed complying with the regulations promulgated by the Indonesian government until the last moment, that is, shortly before the end of the deadline for relocating to the county seat. The deadline was December 1, 1959. At the same time, the local government has also provided them with the necessary assistance and prepared appropriate temporary accommodation for them. The local government is gradually trying to find accommodation for them so that they can reopen their business. Moreover, it is also trying to make it possible to quickly issue them business licenses. If the work of accommodating this category of people has not been fully completed, then it is only a matter of time.

The third category is those who consciously or unconsciously violated the implementation of the regulations stipulated by the Indonesian government. They generally opposed those officials assigned by the Indonesian government to handle the work of accommodating them. The relocation of this category of people could not be completed until after the expiration of the December 1, 1959, deadline. Therefore, I have the impression that this category of people is in a state of hesitation, wanting to comply with the regulations of the Indonesian government on the one hand, and wanting to be loyal to the external aspects that urge and instruct them not to comply with the regulations of the Indonesian government on the other hand.

In this regard, we may need to remember that the history of the past shows that Overseas Chinese have been able to adapt themselves to new situations in more difficult situations, sometimes when their lives were threatened.

At present, with the Indonesian government and people providing them with full assistance, I believe that if the Overseas Chinese themselves can understand and are willing to provide the necessary assistance, all difficulties can be overcome. The Indonesian government also believes that if the people being accommodated are willing and able to get rid of external inflammatory urging and instructions, and are willing to comply with the instructions of the local government, the temporary accommodation centers can be improved. I can cite an example I saw during the inspection: The category of Overseas Chinese influenced by external incitement deliberately crowded in one accommodation center, although other places had been prepared for them, and they usually lived in these places, they did so only in order to create an atmosphere that would slander the Indonesian government in the eyes of the world.

Of course, we admit that no matter how well this temporary accommodation work is done, the relocation work that has been carried out will definitely cause difficulties and make them feel sad for the people involved, because they have become accustomed to the situation of their original residences.

In this regard, I hope that the People's Republic of China can also provide its citizens with the necessary explanations so that everything can proceed smoothly. I do not want to repeat the Indonesian people's evaluation of the activities of Overseas Chinese in the past—whether during the colonial period or the Japanese occupation period, the Indonesian revolutionary period, after the revolution, and at present. Concrete facts provide sufficient reasons to show that the Indonesian people have not felt indebted to the Overseas Chinese in the past and present. I can respect the People's Republic of China's government's desire and ability to protect Overseas Chinese in Indonesia, I only want to remind you that the Overseas Chinese issue is not a problem created by the Indonesian government, nor is it a problem created by the People's Republic of China. The problem we are now facing is the legacy of the colonial period in Indonesia, and for the People's Republic of China, it is the legacy of the past Chinese system, and its nature is far from socialism or social justice.

The Indonesian government began to abolish alien small traders and retailers in rural areas outside the county seat precisely to give the broad social public in rural areas the opportunity to develop and lay their solid foundations in the economic field, especially in the commercial field, where the strength of the Indonesian people is still very weak. The development of Indonesia's socialist economy will be built on the basis of the economic development of the broad social public.

I admit that this measure requires them to make sacrifices, whether it is for Indonesian society or for aliens. However, especially for aliens, according to the capacity of the Indonesian government and people, the Indonesian government is making every effort to alleviate their burdens as much as possible. If foreign nationals can assist the efforts made by the Indonesian government on this issue, then in Indonesia, as we have seen, foreign nationals still have many opportunities to seek a livelihood.

I can clearly point out here that the Indonesian government has no intention of expelling Overseas Chinese from Indonesia back to the People's Republic of China.

On the contrary, the Indonesian government tries its best to let them have new places and certain fields to participate in the economic life of Indonesia. However, if they still want to return to the People's Republic of China in the actual situation where the above-mentioned possibilities exist, the Indonesian government will not obstruct them, and all the tools of the Indonesian government will provide assistance to smoothly realize their wishes.

On this issue, the Indonesian government will perform its duties in accordance with its responsibility to every foreign national who voluntarily requests to leave Indonesia.

For the approximately several thousand Overseas Chinese who request to return to the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian government will fully assist the Embassy of the People's Republic of China to facilitate their realization.

Regarding the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, the Indonesian government in principle does not violate international law. On the contrary, according to the ability of the Indonesian nation, it makes the greatest effort to respect all humanitarian feelings. There is no deprivation of ownership. They are allowed to carry out economic activities in places other than rural areas. If they wish, they are also allowed to return to the People's Republic of China. Based on this sensible measure, the Indonesian government believes that there is no reason to hold negotiations with the government of the People's Republic of China on the issue of the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese.

If there are exceptional issues or accommodation issues in the future that must be played by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China, then the above-mentioned embassy can discuss these issues with the Indonesian government through the usual diplomatic channels.

Regarding the necessary friendly atmosphere for Overseas Chinese to live in peace, I would like to point out that this atmosphere can only be created when both sides show goodwill. The goodwill of the Indonesian government and people is a fact, let the Overseas Chinese prove their goodwill with practical actions, so that we can obtain and cultivate the friendly atmosphere that we both require.

In this regard, I want to state that, as I write this letter, all the activities carried out by Overseas Chinese to shake Indonesia's economy are not conducive to creating a good atmosphere. Without considering the interests of the broad social public, the activities of purchasing materials everywhere at any price cannot but cause difficulties in the daily lives of the broad social public. If this situation continues to occur, then, in order to protect the interests of the social public, the Indonesian government must take the necessary measures that can delay the return of Overseas Chinese to the People's Republic of China.

Regarding the restrictions on the activities of diplomatic officials of the People's Republic of China stationed in Jakarta, I can state that the above-mentioned restrictions have been lifted since January 11, 1960.

The above is my reply to the main content of Your Excellency's letter. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to once again extend my most sincere respects to Your Excellency.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia

    陈毅外长函复印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长
    建议迅速达成遣送华侨的协议
    陈毅外长在信中说：我们相信，只要双方遵守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，认真地进行友好协商，我们两国间正在进行的谈判就会顺利地进展，华侨问题就可望早日获得全面和合理的解决，两国的友好关系就一定能够得到维护和发展。
    新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅就华侨问题于3月15日写信答复印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约1月23日的来信。陈毅外交部长的复信全文如下：雅加达印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约博士阁下阁下：
    我已经收到阁下1960年1月23日的来信。我高兴地注意到，阁下代表印度尼西亚政府，再一次表示了决心在互相巩固友好关系的基础上解决华侨问题的愿望。现在，我们两国已经互换了关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书，并且成立了执行这个条约的联合委员会。双方关于遣送华侨回国的谈判也正在进行，第一批由中国政府派船接运的华侨已经回到中国。这些事实表明，全面解决华侨问题已经有了良好的开端，只要双方真诚合作，继续排除现存的困难，华侨问题是能够逐步获得公平合理的解决的。
    像阁下所知道的，中国政府对于解决华侨问题一贯采取积极的态度。中国政府始终希望具有双重国籍的华侨能够根据自愿原则顺利地选择印度尼西亚国籍，而那些自愿保留中国国籍的华侨也能够在他们的正当权利和利益受到尊重的情况下继续在印度尼西亚居留，对当地的经济发展做出贡献。在印度尼西亚出现了反华排华活动以后，中国政府仍然以两国的友谊为重，根据一贯的立场，提出了全面解决华侨问题的建议。华侨对印度尼西亚经济发展所起的积极作用，本来是无容置疑的。但是，鉴于印度尼西亚政府强调华侨同印度尼西亚的经济发展已经不相适应，而且事实上已经有相当一部分华侨被迫丧失生计，陷于极端困苦的境地，中国政府认为有必要在全面解决华侨问题的建议中提出遣送那些在印度尼西亚无法谋生和不愿意继续居留的华侨回国的问题。这是中国政府为了打开华侨问题上的困难局面所做的一次重大努力。中国政府一再提请印度尼西亚政府根据华侨的自愿负责遣送他们回国，并且对接待和安置回国华侨进行了准备。在印度尼西亚政府表示提供船只一时还有困难的情况下，中国政府主动派出了船只接运华侨回国。这些事实充分说明了中国政府对于解决华侨问题的诚意。
    印度尼西亚政府一再表示，对愿意回国的华侨不会阻挠，并且将尽力给予协助；对此，中国政府表示欢迎。但是，最近回国华侨在印度尼西亚遭遇种种困难的事实，又不能不使我们感到担心。要求回国的华侨，有些被阻不能离开他们的居住地或“收容所”，有些在前往集结港口的途中和到达集结港口以后受到种种留难。回国华侨携带的物品，包括生活日用品在内，受到不少限制。对回国华侨的出境检查，本来是一种正常手续，但是有时却变成对华侨出境的有意刁难。我想这些情况的发生不会出于印度尼西亚政府领导人的意愿。但是，这些情况是事实，而且已经在华侨中引起了严重的不安。华侨既然被迫不能继续居留在他们世代居留过的印度尼西亚，又不能顺利地返回自己的祖国，这自然不能不使他们感到痛心。中国政府希望印度尼西亚政府能够采取措施，迅速改善这种情况，使要求回国的华侨早日实现他们的愿望。
    目前大批华侨纷纷要求回国，而遣送华侨又是一项复杂的工作。中国政府认为双方有必要对这一工作作出通盘和妥善的安排。黄镇大使代表中国政府已经就遣送华侨回国的问题向印度尼西亚政府提出以下要求：（1）停止对华侨的逼迁和其他迫害活动，停止把华侨集中在指定的地点，并且要求印度尼西亚政府在执行其有关华侨的法令中，给予华侨一定时间，以便进行选择，作或者迁移、或者回国的准备；（2）释放在逼迁过程中被拘捕的全部华侨；（3）对已被逼迁和集中的华侨，要求印度尼西亚政府照顾他们的生活，赔偿他们的损失；（4）对丧失生计或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨，要求印度尼西亚政府协助他们前往指定的港口集结，等待遣送回国，并且保证他们在前往港口途中的安全和负责他们在港口的食宿；（5）允许自愿回国的华侨变卖自己的财产，允许他们带回自己的资金和物品，允许被解雇的华侨工人把全部工资和解职金携带回国；（6）要求印度尼西亚政府迅速地安排船只，分期分批遣送上述华侨回国，保证华侨在回国途中的安全。我高兴地获悉，阁下曾经表示，中国政府的上述要求是具有建设性的意见。可以作为解决遣送华侨回国问题的基础。中国政府建议，双方通过协商，在上述要求的基础上迅速达成一项关于遣送华侨回国的协议。如果印度尼西亚政府目前提供船只仍有困难，中国政府愿意继续派遣船只接运华侨回国，并且将船只启航日期尽早通知印度尼西亚政府，以便印度尼西亚政府预作安排，使华侨回国避免不必要的拖延。我们希望，通过双方的合作，遣送华侨回国将会顺利地进行，从而为全面解决华侨问题创造有利的条件。
    中国和印度尼西亚是两个友好的国家，两国人民的友谊是长期的，目前在华侨问题上出现的不利于两国友好的情况只是暂时的。我同阁下之间的信件来往已经使两国在解决华侨问题方面找到了一些共同点。我们相信，只要双方遵守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，认真地进行友好协商，我们两国间正在进行的谈判就会顺利地进展，华侨问题就可望早日获得全面和合理的解决，两国的友好关系就一定能够得到维护和发展。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
    中华人民共和国外交部长　陈　毅
        1960年3月15日于北京
    附：印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约1960年1月23日对陈毅外交部长1959年12月24日信的复信。中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅阁下，阁下：
    我已收到阁下1959年12月24日来信，并已认真研究其内容。
    我很高兴的是：总的说来，上述来信的内容包含着可以用来作为求得接触点的基础的材料。同时来信的语气也含有友好的精神。
    对于我们作为拥有主权和独立的国家来说，我们对若干问题，特别是对必须解决的殖民主义遗留下来的问题，持有不同的立场，这并不是奇怪的问题。在这个问题上，印度尼西亚政府和人民的决心是，一切必须在不损害双方互相尊重和互相巩固友好关系的愿望这个基础的情况下加以解决。在答复阁下的来信中，印度尼西亚政府和人民在上述基础上确定了他们的立场。
    印度尼西亚政府无意在通信中继续进行争论，正如阁下在1959年12月24日来信中也提出的那样。不过为了作必要的解释，印度尼西亚政府就阁下在来信中所提出的各个问题作进一步的说明是有好处的。
    关于双重国籍条约问题，印度尼西亚政府谨此重申，它愿意在中华人民共和国政府表示同意后尽快地互换批准书。自1959年8月以来，印度尼西亚政府就等待着中华人民共和国政府方面的这种赞同的表示。
    在阁下的来信中，如来信的主要内容所指的那样，阁下提到，印度尼西亚政府以1959年第二十号政府条例的形式，单方面制定了实施双重国籍条约的条例。
    请允许我在此说明一下，根据印度尼西亚制定法令的实际做法，每一项经国会批准的法令，包括有关条约的法令，都必须随后制定一项有关实施的指示的政府条例。
    印度尼西亚共和国宪法规定，制定这种条例是印度尼西亚政府根据它的主权而行使的权力。当然，印度尼西亚政府在制定这种条例的时候不损害有关的外国政府的主权。根据印度尼西亚政府的看法，关于实施有关双重国籍的法令的政府条例并没有触犯上述主权。关于1959年第二十号政府条例中所规定的例外情况的问题，我愿意表示，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和周恩来总理的换文给印度尼西亚政府以权利来单方面规定那几类人根据其政治和社会地位可以被认为只具有印度尼西亚国籍。
    关于联合委员会的问题，我已经指定苏山托·蒂多普罗佐法学士为联合委员会中的印度尼西亚代表。希望这个联合委员会将来成功地使双重国籍条约的实施顺利进行。
    阁下的来信详尽地提到，由于印度尼西亚政府的条例的实施而造成华侨的各种困苦。为了亲自证实起见，我有必要到西爪哇地区巡视。在巡视这个地区时，我认真地研究了由于实施关于取缔县首府以外地区外侨小商贩和零售商的1959年第十号总统条例以及关于禁止外侨在县首府以外地区居住的1959／PPU／039号中央战时掌权者条例而造成的各种局面。我再次这样明确指出是有好处的：这项禁令并不含有歧视性质，因为其他外侨，如巴基斯坦、印度、荷兰、阿拉伯、美国等侨民也包括在内。
    在这次巡视中，其目的完全不是为了只看看那些令人愉快的东西，而是为了进行全面的视察并了解在那些方面有必要采取改善地方情况的措施。
    我在巡视中所获得的事实之一是，被禁止营业和居住的华侨可以分为三类。
    第一类是已经自愿遵从印度尼西亚方面的条例并将他们的营业从乡村转移到县首府的人。在上述条例颁布后，这类华侨中的大多数就已立即获得适当的住所和生活，他们当中的许多人在仅仅几个月的时间内就已经成功地把他们的营业从乡村转移到县首府。在这件事情上，他们得到地方政府的许多帮助。
    第二类人是拖延遵从印度尼西亚政府所颁布的条例，直到最后的时刻，即在规定必须迁往县首府的期限结束前不久。期限是1959年12月1日。同时地方政府也已经给予他们必需的帮助，并且为他们准备了适当的临时住所，地方政府逐步地设法为他们找住所，以便他们重新开业。而且也设法使发给他们营业执照这件事能够迅速实现。如果收容这类人的工作尚未全部完成，那么，这只是时间问题而已。
    第三类是自觉或不自觉地违抗印度尼西亚政府所规定的条例的实施的人。他们一般都反对那些由印度尼西亚政府委派去处理收容他们的工作的执行任务的官员，这类人的迁移工作直至1959年12月1日期满后才能够完成。因此，我有这样的印象：这类人是处在动摇的状态中，一方面想要遵从印度尼西亚政府的条例；另一方面想要效忠于催促和指示他们不要遵从印度尼西亚政府的条例的外来方面。
    在这方面，我们大概有必要记住：过去时期的历史说明，华侨在更困难、有时在生命受到威胁的情况下，能够使自己适应于新的情况。
    目前，在他们获得印度尼西亚政府和人民的充分帮助的情况下，我相信，如果华侨自己能谅解并愿意给予必要的帮助，一切困难是可以克服的。印度尼西亚政府还认为，如果被收容的人愿意和能够摆脱外来的煽动性的催促和指示，并且愿意遵从地方政府的指示，临时收容所是可以加以改善的。我可以举我在巡视时所看到的一个例子：受到外来煽动的影响的那类华侨故意挤在一个收容所里，其实已给他们准备了其他的地方，而他们平时的确是住在这些地方，他们这样做只是为了能够制造会使印度尼西亚政府在世界的眼中受到诽谤的气氛。
    当然我们承认：不管这种临时住所的工作做得怎么好，已经进行的迁移工作一定会给有关的人造成困难和使他们感到伤心，因为他们已经习惯于他们原来的住所的情况。
    在这方面，我希望，中华人民共和国也能向它的公民作必要的说明，以便一切都能顺利进行，我不想再重复印度尼西亚人民对华侨在过去时期——不论是在殖民时期或在日本占领时期，印度尼西亚革命时期、革命以后和目前——的活动的评价。具体事实提供了足够的理由说明：印度尼西亚人民在过去和现在都不会感到欠下华侨的恩情。我可以尊重中华人民共和国政府保护在印度尼西亚的华侨的愿望和能力，我只想提醒：华侨问题不是印度尼西亚政府制造的，也不是中华人民共和国制造的一个问题，我们现在所面临的问题是在印度尼西亚的殖民时期的遗物，而对中华人民共和国来说，是过去中国制度的遗物，它的性质同社会主义或社会公正是迥然不同的。
    印度尼西亚政府开始取缔县首府以外的乡村地区外侨小商贩和零售商，正是为了使乡村地区的广大的社会公众有机会在经济方面，特别是在印度尼西亚人民的力量迄今仍然十分薄弱的商业方面，发展和打下他们的巩固基础。走向社会主义的印度尼西亚经济的发展将建立在广大的社会公众的经济发展的基础上。
    我承认，不论对印度尼西亚社会抑或对外侨，这一措施要求他们都作出牺牲。但是特别对外侨，根据印度尼西亚政府和人民的能力，印度尼西亚政府尽可能努力减轻他们的负担。如果，外国籍民在此问题上能协助印度尼西亚政府所作的努力，那么，在印度尼西亚，正如同我们所见到的，外国籍民仍然还有许多机会谋求生计。
    我可以在此明确指出，印度尼西亚政府无意从印度尼西亚驱逐华侨返回中华人民共和国。
    相反的，印度尼西亚政府尽力让他们有新的地方和一定的领域参加印度尼西亚的经济生活。但是，如果他们在存在上述可能性的实际情况下，仍然想返回中华人民共和国，印度尼西亚政府是不会阻挠的，并且印度尼西亚政府的所有工具将给予协助以顺利地实现他们的愿望。
    在这个问题上，印度尼西亚政府将根据它对每一个自愿要求离开印度尼西亚的外国籍民的责任来执行其任务。
    对于那些要求回到中华人民共和国的约计数千名的华侨，印度尼西亚政府将充分地协助中华人民共和国大使馆以促其实现。
    关于华侨的正当权利和利益，印度尼西亚政府原则上不违犯国际公法，相反的，根据印度尼西亚民族的能力，尽最大的努力遵崇一切人道主义的感情。对所有权的剥夺是不存在的，他们被允许在除了乡村以外的其他地方进行经济活动。假如他们愿意，他们也被允许返回中华人民共和国。基于这种明智的措施，因此，印度尼西亚政府认为，没有理由就华侨的正当权利和利益问题同中华人民共和国政府举行谈判。
    假如将来有例外的问题或收容工作的问题，必须由中华人民共和国大使馆起作用的话，那末上述大使馆可以通过通常的外交途径就这些问题同印度尼西亚政府商谈。
    关于使华侨得以安心生活的必要的友好气氛，我愿意提出，只有当双方表现出良好的愿望的时候，这种气氛才能够创造。印度尼西亚政府和人民方面的良好愿望是一种事实，让华侨以实际行动来证明他们的良好愿望，以便能够获得和培植我们共同要求的友好气氛。
    在这个问题上，我要表明，在我写这封信的时候，华侨为动摇印度尼西亚的经济所进行的一切活动，是无助于创造良好气氛的。在不考虑广大的社会公众的利益的情况下，到处不计价格地收购物资的活动不能不造成广大的社会公众的日常生活的困难。如果这种情况继续发生，那么，为了保护社会公众的利益，印度尼西亚政府必须采取能够延缓华侨返回中华人民共和国的必要的措施。
    关于对中华人民共和国驻雅加达外交官员的活动的限制，我可以表示，上述限制已自1960年1月11日撤消。
    以上就是我对阁下来信的主要内容的答复。最后，我想借此机会再次向阁下致以最崇高的敬意。
                    印度尼西亚共和国外交部长
                        苏班德里约博士
                                    1960年1月23日于雅加达
