Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 30th. Mao Xinyu, Consul of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, flew to Pontianak in Kalimantan this morning to continue handling the repatriation of Overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire in Bangka.

The second batch of ships "Hai Huang" and "Da Bao Kang," sent by the Chinese government to pick up Overseas Chinese from Bangka, will arrive in Singkawang, West Kalimantan, on the 31st.

Mao Xinyu visited West Kalimantan in early March to inspect the situation of Overseas Chinese there and to consult with the Indonesian military and political authorities there on the repatriation of Overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire in Bangka.

Among the Overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire in Bangka, more than 3,000 have registered to return to their motherland. More than 600 Overseas Chinese refugees have already left Singkawang on March 18th on ships sent by the motherland to return home.

At the same time, Jiang Yan, Chinese Consul in Machen, went to Samarinda a few days ago to handle the repatriation of Overseas Chinese in East Kalimantan who have lost their livelihoods due to forced relocation. A ship sent by the Chinese government will sail to Samarinda to pick up these displaced Overseas Chinese to return home.

    分别去坤甸和三马林达处理华侨回国问题
    新华社雅加达30日电　中国驻雅加达总领事馆领事毛欣禹，今天上午乘飞机前往加里曼丹的坤甸，去继续处理接运邦戛的遭受火灾的华侨回国的问题。
    中国政府派去接运邦戛华侨回国的第二批船只“海皇号”和“大宝康号”将于31日到达西加里曼丹的山口洋。
    毛欣禹曾于3月初到西加里曼丹去视察那里的华侨情况，并就接运邦戛遭受火灾的华侨问题同那里的印度尼西亚军政当局进行磋商。
    在邦戛遭受火灾的华侨中间，共有三千多人登记要求回祖国。已有六百多名华侨难民在3月18日搭乘祖国派去的轮船离开山口洋回国。
    同时，中国驻马辰领事江燕在几天前去三马林达，处理接运东加里曼丹由于受迫迁而失去生计的华侨回国的问题。中国政府派去的一艘轮船将驶往三马林达去接运这些流离失所的华侨回国。
