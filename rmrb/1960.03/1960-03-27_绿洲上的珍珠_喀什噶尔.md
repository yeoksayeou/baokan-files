    Pearl on the Oasis—Kashgar
    By Our Correspondent Liang Mingda

    The Kashgar River rolls down from the Pamir Plateau towards the plain oasis, nourishing the fertile fields of the oasis and embracing the ancient city of Kashgar, a pearl on the oasis.
    Those who come to Kashgar for the first time will feel that it is like a newly emerging frontier city. But those who revisit it will no longer be able to recognize its former appearance. The low, dilapidated houses and narrow alleys of the past are nowhere to be seen. Four new wide streets form a neat "cross." Along the streets, new brick buildings in silver-white and light blue, decorated with traditional Uyghur patterns, stand one after another. Newly planted willows line the sidewalks. Uyghur men and women dressed in colorful spring clothes bustle about on the streets. Policemen stand at the crossroads, directing the buses, cars, and trucks that speed back and forth. A Uyghur elder who has lived in Kashgar for generations told us that this very intersection was a muddy pit four years ago. Now, the magnificent three-story department store, the People's Hotel, the cinema, the Xinhua Bookstore, the library, etc., stand here, making it the most bustling place. Last year alone, the newly built area of the city reached 98,159 square meters, which is more than the total construction area in the sixty-five years before liberation. In just a few years, the population of Kashgar has increased from more than 40,000 to more than 140,000.
    We arrived in Kashgar during the Bazaar Day, and Uyghur men and women from the rural suburbs, wearing colorful skirts and jackets, were like celebrating a festival. In addition to the dazzling array of clothing and daily necessities, the shop windows displayed silver-inlaid filigree knives and beautiful, exquisite Uyghur flower caps and leather boots for customers to choose from. Attending the bazaar, a tradition passed down through generations for the regular exchange of local agricultural and sideline products, is still maintained today. March 10 was an ordinary Bazaar Day, and the transaction volume on that day increased more than twofold compared to previous years.
    Kashgar City is famous throughout Xinjiang for its exquisite Uyghur flower caps, folk musical instruments, and leather shoes. These products have been sold throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains for hundreds of years. But before liberation, the sales of these traditional handicrafts were on the verge of extinction, and many handicraft workers lost their jobs. In recent years, the crystallization of their labor and wisdom has been restored and developed, and sales have been very large. A total of 3,800 people in Kashgar City are engaged in the production of flower caps. On a piece of cloth less than a foot in size, Uyghur artists show their remarkable talents. With embroidery, weaving, and drawnwork, they can make small caps with 270 different patterns. Adjacent to the flower cap factory is the musical instrument factory, which brings together excellent craftsmen from the Kashgar area to produce various musical instruments for the Uyghur people, who love singing and dancing. Their manufactured rawaps, dutars, tanburs, and other traditional Uyghur musical instruments are often in short supply.
    The biggest change is the growth of modern industry. This consumer city, which could not even find a single modern machine before liberation, now has patches of white factory buildings and towering chimneys in the suburbs. There are twenty-five modern and semi-mechanized factories for machinery manufacturing, power generation, smelting, cement, printing, etc. The first textile factory in the Tarim Basin with 80,000 spindles is under construction in the southern suburbs. After 30,000 spindles are put into production in early autumn, people of all ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang will be able to wear colorful cloths woven from cotton produced by themselves. Since 1959, it has been able to produce heavy-duty gantry planers, universal milling machines, and complete sets of small blast furnace equipment. Last year, the production of means of production in Kashgar City accounted for 34.2% of the total industrial output value. In the first two months of this year, the total industrial output value increased by 24.5% compared with the same period last year. The Uyghur people, who had never seen machines for generations, are now operating modern lathes and generators. (Attached picture)

### 绿洲上的珍珠——喀什噶尔

    绿洲上的珍珠——喀什噶尔
    本报记者　梁明达
    喀什噶尔河从帕米尔高原滚滚泻向山下平坦的绿洲，它滋养着绿洲上千里沃野，环抱着绿洲上的珍珠——喀什噶尔古城。
    初到喀什噶尔城的人，都会觉得它像一座新兴的边疆城市。而旧地重游的人，却已无法辨认昔日的模样。大街上过去低矮、破烂的房屋和狭窄的巷道，已经没有一点影子。四条新型的大街，组成一个整齐的“十字”，大街两旁，银白色和浅蓝色相间的雕有维吾尔传统图案的新型砖房一座连一座，人行道旁新栽的杨柳成行。街道上身着各色春装的维吾尔族男男女女熙熙攘攘，民警站在十字路口，指挥着来往奔驰的公共汽车、小汽车和大卡车。一个世居在喀什噶尔的维吾尔族老人告诉我们，就是这个十字路口，四年前还是烂泥坑。如今这里林立着宏伟的三层百货大楼、人民饭店、电影院、新华书店、图书馆……，成为最热闹的地方。去年一年，全市新兴的建筑物面积共达九万八千一百五十九平方米，比解放前六十五年建筑面积总和还要多。短短几年，喀什的人口已从四万多人增加到十四万多人。
    我们到喀什时，正逢巴札天，来自郊区农村身穿彩裙和夹袢的维吾尔族男女如同过节。各商店橱窗里除堆放琳琅满目的衣料和日用百货外，还陈列着银镶缕花的小刀和美丽玲珑的维族花帽、皮靴，供顾客选购。赶巴札，这个世代相沿定期交换土副产品的习俗，至今仍然保持。3月10日是个普通的巴札天，这天的交易额比往年增加一倍以上。
    喀什市以生产精致的维族花帽、民间乐器、皮鞋驰名全疆，产品行销天山南北，经营历史已有好几百年。但在解放前，这传统性的手工艺品销路濒于绝境，许多手工业工人失业。近几年来，他们的劳动和智慧的结晶品才得到了恢复和发展，而且销路很大，全喀什市共有三千八百人从事花帽的生产。在不到一尺的布面上，维吾尔族艺人表现了他们卓越的才能。有刺绣、有编织、有挑花，竟可做出二百七十种不同花色图案的小帽。同花帽工厂为邻的是乐器厂，这里集中了喀什一带优秀的能工巧匠，为喜歌善舞的维吾尔族人民生产各种乐器，他们制造的热瓦甫、独他、弹波尔等维吾尔族传统乐器，常常供不应求。
    变化最大的还是现代工业的成长。这个在解放前连一架现代机器也找不到的消费城市，现在郊区出现了一片一片白色厂房，立起高耸的烟囱。这里有机械制造、发电、冶炼、水泥、印刷等二十五个现代化和半机械化工厂，塔里木盆地第一座拥有八万纱锭的纺织厂正在南郊紧张施工，其中三万锭初秋投入生产后，南疆各族人民就能穿上用自己生产的棉花织成的各色花布。从1959年以后，这里已能生产出重型龙门刨床，万能铣床和全套小型高炉设备。去年，全喀什噶尔市生产资料的生产已占工业总产值的34．2％，今年头两个月，工业总产值比去年同期又增长了24．5％。世世代代没有见过机器的维吾尔人，今天已操纵着现代化的车床和发电机。（附图片）
