    From Seedling to Great Tree
    Liu Feng

    A packaging worker who fundamentally didn't understand mechanical principles drew a large circle and several small circles on a piece of letter paper, writing "Input," "Release Tube," and "Outlet" on them. Who could understand what this was? However, this diagram expressed the female workers' urgent desire to escape manual operations and change the backward state of production. It was from this blueprint, which no one could understand, that, with the strong support of the Party and government leadership of the Shanghai Daily Chemical Products Factory No. 2, and after the supplementation, improvement, and experimentation by many people, the first automatic cold cream filling machine was born.

    Such things have appeared in many places and are appearing more and more every day. The flowers of technical innovation and technical revolution are constantly budding, growing, and strengthening in the East Wind.

    Marxists have always concentrated their greatest attention on new things, always filled with firm confidence, enthusiastically caring for and cultivating new things, and doing everything possible to clear the way for new things and create conditions for their growth. On every achievement of our technical innovation and technical revolution, the brilliance of the Party shines. For example, the Party organization of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory has consistently supported every technical innovation proposal of the workers with full enthusiasm. More importantly: the leaders of this factory not only support the relatively mature innovation proposals put forward by the workers but also enthusiastically support many immature, imperfect proposals with many shortcomings, even if a certain proposal seemed like a beautiful "fantasy" at the time, the leadership always supported it enthusiastically. When encountering difficulties and temporary failures in experiments, they also motivated the masses, identified key issues, overcame key issues, and continuously moved forward.

    New things are always imperfect because they are young and only embryonic. It needs to constantly overcome shortcomings and solve one difficulty after another before it can take shape. However, we cannot wait until it takes shape before supporting it because new things especially need support and encouragement precisely when they are immature and young seedlings. It is relatively easy for leaders to support the relatively mature innovation proposals put forward by the workers because such proposals already show promise and have a grasp of success. However, there are often more complex and cutting-edge innovations and creations that cannot be conceived so perfectly when proposed, and are even very simple. But many great innovations and creations are conceived and born within these. Therefore, we must not only support and cherish immature, imperfect, small, and seemingly unimportant new things with full enthusiasm and sincerity, but more importantly, we must also enthusiastically encourage workers and peasants to experiment and research suggestions that seem like "fantasies," suggestions that ordinary people would not even dare to think of. In this way, many miracles will be created, and many problems that could never be solved will be solved.

    New things themselves have strong vitality. It can overcome difficulties and unfavorable conditions, and it will stand out, which no external force can stop. A tiny seed, as long as it falls into moist soil and is illuminated by the warm sun, will grow into a tender sprout and become a great tree day and night. Dense forests are grown from many tiny seeds. Today, our motherland is the best place for new things to grow. It has all the conditions necessary for the germination of new things; it also takes care of the growth and strengthening of new things meticulously. The current blossoming of technical innovation and technical revolution is inseparable from our superior socialist system.

    Communists always stand at the forefront of history because we always rely closely on new things and new forces. And new things always represent the direction of social and historical development. As new technologies are constantly produced, production is constantly developing, and society is constantly advancing. We are always with new things, and we are also always new. Therefore, we become an eternally invincible force, with lasting youth, never failing.

    We are doing a great cause unprecedented in history, and we are always doing the work of getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, so society is constantly becoming new day by day. Thousands upon thousands of new things are growing from seedlings into towering trees, developing into lush forests.

    从萌芽到大树
    刘丰
    一位根本不懂机械原理的包装女工，在一张信纸上，画着一个大圈圈和几个小圈圈，上面写着“进料”、“放管”、“出口处”等字样。谁能看得懂这是什么呢？可是这张图表达了女工们迫切要求摆脱手工操作、改变落后生产面貌的强烈愿望。也就是由这一张谁也看不懂的图纸开始，经过上海日用化学品二厂党政领导上的大力支持，经过许多人的补充、改进、试验，最后，第一台冷霜自动灌压机出世了。
    这样的事情，在许多地方出现过，并且一天比一天多地出现。技术革新和技术革命的鲜花，在东风里不断在萌芽、茁长和壮大。
    马克思主义者从来就是把最大的注意力集中在新生事物上面，永远满怀坚定的信心，热情地关怀和培植新生事物，千方百计地为新生事物扫清道路，创造成长的条件。在我们每一件技术革新和技术革命的成就上，都闪耀着党的光辉。例如西安人民搪瓷厂的党组织一贯满腔热情地支持工人的每一个技术革新的建议。更重要的是：这个厂的领导，不只是支持工人提出的比较成熟的革新建议，而且也热情支持许多不成熟，不完善甚至缺点还很多的建议，即使某一个建议在当时看来仅仅是个美好的“幻想”，领导上从来都是热情地支持。在试验中遇到困难和暂时的失败时候，也是激励群众，找出关键，攻克关键，不断前进。
    新生事物总是不完善的，因为它幼小，只是萌芽性的东西。需要不断的克服缺点和解决一个个的困难，它才能成形像样。可是我们不能等到它成形像样才去支持它，因为新生事物特别需要扶植、支持的时候，正是不成熟、幼小萌芽的时候。领导者支持工人提出比较成熟的革新建议这是比较容易的，因为这样建议已经看出苗头，有成功的把握。可是也往往有更多的复杂的、尖端的革新创造，建议的时候不可能设想得那么完善，甚至非常简单。可是许多伟大的革新和创造，正是在这里面孕育诞生出来的。因此我们不仅对不成熟的、不完善、细小的、看来是无关重要的新生事物，要满腔热情地、真心诚意地支持它、爱护它，更重要的是对看来还是
  “幻想”的建议，在普通人连想也不敢想的建议，也要百般热情地鼓励工人、农民去试验研究。这样许多奇迹就会创造出来，许多从来不能解决的问题也会得到解决。
    新生事物本身具有强大的生命力。它能克服困难、战胜不利的条件，它会脱颖而出，是任何外力也阻止不了的。一粒微小的种子，只要落到润泽的土壤里，又被温暖的阳光照煦，就会生长出嫩芽，日长夜大成为大树。密密的森林就是由许许多多一粒粒微小的种子成长起来的。今天我们的祖国就是最适宜于新生事物生长的好天地。它具有新生事物萌芽所需要的一切条件；它也无微不至地照顾新生事物的茁长和壮大。目前技术革新和技术革命之花盛开，是和我们的优越的社会主义制度不可分的。
    共产党人永远站在历史的最前列，就因为我们始终紧紧依靠新生事物和新生力量。而新生事物一直就代表着社会历史发展的方向。新的技术不断产生，生产不断发展，社会也就不断前进。我们永远和新生事物在一起，我们也就永远新生。于是我们就成为永远不可战胜的力量，青春常在，永不败谢。
    我们正在干着史无前例的伟大事业，我们永远做着除旧布新的工作，社会就在不断地日日新又日新。千千万万的新生事物，就是这样地从萌芽成长为参天的大树，发展为葱郁的森林。
