    Hebei Sweet Potato Area Doubles
    Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei, Averages One Mu of Sweet Potatoes Planted Per Person

    This newspaper Tianjin, March 30th dispatch: Hebei Province's Party organizations at all levels, in the spirit of "taking grain as the key link," are vigorously developing sweet potato production. This year, the province plans to plant 20 million mu of tuber crops, more than double that of last year. At present, people's communes and production teams are actively carrying out various planting preparations such as seedling cultivation, fertilizer delivery, land preparation, irrigation, and moisture preservation.

    Hebei Province is an old area for planting tuber crops. In recent years, the area of high-yield crops, mainly sweet potatoes, has accounted for one-fifth of the province's grain planting area, but the output accounts for nearly half of the total grain output. Last year, the province's 9.75 million mu of sweet potatoes averaged 650 jin of grain per mu, 1.4 times higher than the yield of corn per mu, and 38% higher than the yield of rice per mu. Therefore, the vast number of cadres and masses attach great importance to sweet potato production. They said that sweet potatoes are the "king of high yield," one mu is equivalent to several mu of other crops, has a wide range of uses, and is also very delicious to eat.

    In order to ensure that sweet potatoes are planted well and to realize the call of the Provincial Party Committee for large-scale high-yield of "1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes," the vast number of commune members began to carefully select sweet potato seeds and cultivate seedlings as early as January, generally 20 days to a month earlier than in previous years. At present, in Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding and other southern regions, many sweet potato bed seedlings have emerged from the soil, and some seedlings are already about a foot tall. In order to ensure that there are enough seedlings for expanding sweet potato planting, all localities have stepped up seed exchange in advance. Many regions have realized the optimization of sweet potato seeds, and have generally taken measures such as selecting fine seeds, removing inferior seeds, and soaking seeds in warm water. For some communes and teams that lack sweet potato seeds, the problem of lacking seeds has been solved through mutual support and exchange. In the work of seedling cultivation, all localities have also actively trained technicians and promoted advanced seedling cultivation experience. Shijiazhuang area has trained more than 200,000 technicians, and Tianjin area has fixed more than 1,000 cadres at all levels and 12,000 farmer technicians to be responsible for seedling cultivation work. Chengde area has universally promoted the "high-temperature rapid seedling cultivation method" created by the Prefectural Scientific Research Institute throughout the area. Using this seedling cultivation method, seedlings emerge four or five days earlier than using the old method, and the seedlings are stronger, and the number of plants has also increased more than twice. More than 640,000 mu of sweet potatoes in the area can save more than 15 million jin of sweet potato seeds.

    In the sweet potato preparation work, all localities have focused on farmland capital construction such as water, fertilizer, and soil, and vigorously promoted sweet potato high-yield plots and garden-style management, striving to ensure that all sweet potato fields can be irrigated and drained, and are insured against both drought and flood. In the sweet potato fields in Shijiazhuang area, 2 million mu have been divided into high-yield plots. At present, many areas have completed planting preparations such as fertilizer delivery, spring irrigation, and deep plowing of land. Gaocheng County's 200,000 mu of spring sweet potato fields have generally been spring-irrigated and deeply ploughed, and more than 78,000 mu have been ridged and are waiting to be planted. While vigorously developing water and fertilizer, all localities have also widely carried out large-scale high-yield competition movements for producing 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. Counties compete with counties, communes compete with communes, and teams compete with teams. In Tangshan area, the sweet potato high-yield plots managed by 48 production teams from four communes, including Mujing and Anshan in Changli County, have challenged the brother communes in the entire area to compete. The competition has powerfully promoted the sweet potato preparation work. Each mu of all square fields has been fertilized with an average of 20,000 jin of manure, universally deep-ploughed once, and more than 80,000 mu have been watered.

    This newspaper dispatch: Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, in implementing the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively arranging diversified management, is vigorously planting sweet potatoes.

    Xiangyang Prefecture has a tradition of planting sweet potatoes. In 1958, the area of sweet potatoes in the prefecture was 1.68 million mu, with a total output of more than 660 million jin (converted to grain). The broad masses of the people are very enthusiastic about expanding the planting area of sweet potatoes. The Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee and the Party Committees of all counties and communes began to lead the masses to reclaim wasteland, prepare land in advance, and keep more sweet potato seeds as early as last autumn and winter. Since last autumn, more than 5 million mu of new wasteland has been reclaimed in the prefecture, which has laid the foundation for comprehensive agricultural production increase, especially the expansion of sweet potato area. After discussions from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the prefecture decided to expand the sweet potato area to 3.5 million mu to 4 million mu this year, more than double the past. On average, each agricultural population has about one mu of sweet potatoes. Jun County is a mountainous area. Last year, the county's 300,000 people planted 200,000 mu of sweet potatoes, and achieved a great harvest in a severe drought; this year, it plans to expand to 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes, averaging more than 1.5 mu per person. Among them, 400,000 mu of sweet potatoes are used as food and to develop local non-staple food production; 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes are used exclusively as pig feed. Calculated at three pigs per mu of sweet potatoes, the county can raise 300,000 pigs, achieving an average of one pig per person.

    Since the beginning of spring, the farmers in Xiangyang Prefecture have been busy with early deep plowing of sweet potato fields, multiple plowing and fine harrowing, and applying sufficient base fertilizer. Now they are busy with early ridging and early seeding and seedling cultivation. The 400,000 mu of winter-fallow sweet potato fields in Jun County have all been plowed twice, of which 210,000 mu have been tilled three to four times. More than 80% of the sweet potato fields have been deeply ploughed to a depth of six to eight inches, making the ground flat and the clods broken, and base fertilizer has been applied and ridges (mounds) have been made. Many areas have put forward the slogan "Sweet potatoes go up the mountains," transforming barren mountains and ridges, making full use of the land. According to incomplete statistics in the prefecture, more than 22,000 "sweet potato mountains" and "sweet potato ridges" have been opened up. In February, Yun County mobilized 120,000 laborers, led by more than 12,000 cadres, to camp in the mountains and work hard for ten days, reclaiming wasteland and transforming fields, deep plowing and fine tilling, fertilizing and ridging, and by the end of February, 120,000 mu of spring sweet potato fields had been prepared.

    Recently, all localities are seeding and cultivating seedlings, about 20 days to a month earlier than the sweet potato seeding period in previous years. Many counties and communes have completed all the seeding, and have fixed professional teams to be responsible for strengthening the management of sweet potato seedling beds; because the seeding is earlier, universal attention has been paid to taking measures to prevent cold and frost and protect the seedlings.

    This year, more sweet potatoes are planted, so it is necessary to consider how to properly store and handle them in the future, so as to achieve comprehensive utilization. All localities plan to vigorously promote sweet potato slicing machines (for drying), feed pulverizers and other processing equipment (establishing starch factories, wineries, pig farms, etc.) so as to achieve good planting, good management, good harvesting, good storage, and good utilization.

    河北甘薯面积扩大一倍
    湖北襄阳专区平均每人种一亩甘薯
    本报天津30日电　河北省各级党组织，本着“以粮为纲”的精神，大力发展甘薯生产。今年全省计划种植薯类作物二千万亩，比去年扩大一倍多。目前，各人民公社、生产队正在积极进行育秧、送肥、整地建方、灌水保墒等各项播种准备工作。
    河北省是种植薯类作物的老区。几年来，以甘薯为主的高产作物面积，占全省粮食播种面积的五分之一，但产量却占粮食总产量的近一半。去年全省九百七十五万亩甘薯，平均亩产折粮六百五十斤，比玉米亩产高一点四倍，比水稻亩产高38％。因此，广大干部群众十分重视甘薯的生产。他们说，甘薯是高产之王，一亩要顶几亩田，用途广，人吃也很可口。
    为保证把甘薯种好，实现省委提出的“千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯”大面积丰产的号召，广大社员群众，从1月份就动手精选薯种，开始育秧，一般地区都比往年提前二十天到一个月。目前，南部邯郸、石家庄、保定等地区，不少薯床秧苗已经出土，有的秧苗已高达一尺左右。为保证扩种甘薯有足够的种苗，各地事先大抓薯种调换，许多地区实现了薯种优良化，并对薯种普遍进行了选精去劣、温汤浸种等措施。对于一些缺薯种的社、队，通过相互支援，互通有无，缺薯种的问题得到了解决。在育秧工作中，各地还积极培训技术人员，推广先进的育苗经验。石家庄地区共训练了二十多万名技术人员，天津地区已固定各级干部一千多人，农民技术人员一万二千人，专管育苗工作。承德地区在全区范围内普遍推广了专区科学研究所创造的“高温快速育秧法”，用这种育秧方法，比用旧方法育秧早出秧四、五天，并且秧苗壮，棵数也比过去增加了二倍多，全区六十四万多亩甘薯，可以节省薯种一千五百多万斤。
    各地在甘薯备耕工作中，大抓水、肥、土等农田基本建设，大搞甘薯丰产方、园田化，力争所有甘薯田作到能灌能排，旱涝双保险。石家庄地区的甘薯田中，有二百万亩划分了丰产方。目前，已有不少地区完成了送肥、春灌、深翻土地等播种准备工作。藁城县二十万亩春薯田，普遍进行了春灌和深翻，并有七万八千多亩打好了埂，等待栽种。各地在大搞水肥的同时，还广泛地开展了亩产万斤薯的大面积丰产竞赛运动。县与县、社与社、队与队之间开展携手赛、对手赛和连边赛。唐山地区的昌黎县由木井、安山等四个公社的四十八个生产队分别经营的甘薯丰产方，向全区各兄弟社提出了挑战竞赛。通过竞赛有力地推动了甘薯备耕工作，全部方田每亩平均已送粪二万斤，普遍深翻了一遍，并有八万多亩浇上了水。
    本报讯　湖北襄阳专区在贯彻执行以粮为纲、全面安排多种经营的方针下，大种甘薯。
    襄阳专区向有种甘薯的习惯。1958年，全区甘薯面积有一百六十八万亩，总产量达到六亿六千多万斤（折粮）。广大群众对扩大甘薯种植面积的积极性很高。中共襄阳地委和各县、各公社党委早在去年秋、冬间，就开始领导群众开荒、提前炕地、多留甘薯种等工作。去秋以来，全区新开荒地五百万亩以上，这样就给农业全面增产、特别是扩大甘薯面积打下了基础。经过自上而下和自下而上的讨论，全区决定今年甘薯面积扩大到三百五十万亩至四百万亩，较过去增加一倍多。平均每个农业人口约有一亩甘薯。均县是个山区，全县三十万人，去年栽了二十万亩甘薯，获得了大旱大丰收；今年计划扩大到五十万亩甘薯，平均每人合一亩半多。其中以四十万亩甘薯作为食粮和发展地方副食品生产；以十万亩甘薯专作猪饲料，按每亩甘薯养三头猪计算，全县能养三十万头猪，达到平均每人一头猪。
    入春以来，襄阳专区农民就忙着提早深翻甘薯地，多犁细耙，施足底肥。现在又忙着提早打好垅，提早下种育苗。均县四十万亩冬闲甘薯地，已经全部翻耕两道，其中有二十一万亩整过三至四道，80％以上的甘薯地都深耕六寸至八寸，作到了地平垡碎，并且施了底肥，打好了垅（堆）。许多地区提出“甘薯上山”的口号，改造荒山野岭，充分利用土地，全区不完全统计，已经开辟了二万二千多个“甘薯山”、“甘薯岭”。郧县在2月间就调集十二万劳动力，由一万二千多名干部带领上山扎营，大干十天，边开荒改田，边深耕细整，边施肥打垅，到2月底已经整好了十二万亩春甘薯地。
    近来，各地正在下种育苗，比往年甘薯下种期提早了二十天到一个月左右。许多县和公社全部下完了种，并固定专业班子负责加强甘薯苗池的管理工作；因为下种提早了，普遍注意做好防寒防冻措施，保护好薯苗。
    今年甘薯种得多了，就要考虑将来保管、处理好，做到综合利用。各地计划大力推广甘薯切片机（晒干）、饲料粉碎机及其他加工设备（建立淀粉厂、酒厂、养猪场等），做到种好、管好、收好、藏好、利用好。
