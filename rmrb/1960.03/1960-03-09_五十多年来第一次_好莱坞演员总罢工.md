Xinhua News Agency, 8th – For the first time in over fifty years, actors from the seven major Hollywood film companies launched a general strike at 12:01 AM (local time) on the 7th, bringing the self-proclaimed American film capital, Hollywood, to a standstill.

The films produced by the seven striking companies (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia, United Artists, Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, Warner Brothers, and Disney) account for approximately 80% of all American films. Film production at these companies has now completely ceased.

Films are frequently shown on American television, generating substantial profits for producers, but film actors do not receive adequate compensation from this. The central issue of this strike is the Screen Actors Guild's demand that each member receive 6% to 7% of television revenue, but the film companies association has even refused to negotiate this demand. Prior to this, the Writers Guild of America has also been on strike since January 16th due to this issue.

Currently, 14,000 American film actors are participating in this strike, which is the first major strike in the Actors Guild's history of over fifty years.

It is estimated that this strike could ultimately affect 20,000 or more actors.

### 五十多年来第一次  好莱坞演员总罢工

    五十多年来第一次
    好莱坞演员总罢工
    新华社8日讯  美国好莱坞七大影片公司的演员自7日上午十二时零一分（当地时间）起举行第一次演员总罢工，号称美国电影之都的好莱坞顿时陷于瘫痪状态。
    举行罢工的七家影片公司（米高梅、哥伦比亚、联合艺术家、派拉蒙、二十世纪—福克斯、华尔纳兄弟和狄斯奈）所生产的影片约占美国全部影片的80％。现在这些公司的影片生产已经完全停止。
    在美国电视中经常放映影片，制片商由此而大赚其钱，但电影演员却不能从此得到应有的报酬。这次罢工的中心问题就是，电影演员协会要求每个会员能得到6％到7％的电视报酬，但电影公司协会甚至拒绝谈判这个要求。在这以前，美国作家协会也因为这个问题自1月16日起一直在进行罢工。
    目前，有一万四千名美国电影演员参加了这次罢工，这是演员协会在五十多年的历史中的第一次大罢工。
    据估计，这次罢工最后可能会影响到两万或者更多的演员。
