Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 17th: The Secretariat for External Liaison of the Cuban Organizing Committee for the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America cabled the China-Latin America Friendship Association tonight, sending congratulations. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

“The Executive Committee of the Organizing Committee for the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America extends fraternal congratulations to the Chinese people who are holding a conference to establish the China-Latin America Friendship Association. The people of Martí's America, with the Cuban people at the forefront, are engaged in fierce struggles for full sovereignty and for the full enjoyment of their resources by the masses of the people, in the great action against the continued aggression of their common enemy, American imperialism.

Although the Batista dictatorship has been overthrown in Cuba, the Jiménez dictatorship has been overthrown in Venezuela, the Odría dictatorship has been overthrown in Peru, and the Rojas Pinilla dictatorship has been overthrown in Colombia, there still exist in the Americas and the world bloody dictatorships supported and encouraged by imperialism, such as those of Trujillo (Dominican Republic), Stroessner (Paraguay), Duvalier (Haiti), and Somoza (Nicaragua). The people of Latin America are making their contributions and giving their support in the united action to overthrow these dictators.

In these decisive moments of our history, we have received the unanimous support of the glorious Chinese people with deep gratitude. The Chinese people have successfully defeated the imperialist forces that oppressed them throughout the past century, and are vigorously building a country that fully controls its own destiny in the Great Leap Forward, working tirelessly for the happiness of their children, and at the same time making great contributions to the cause of peaceful coexistence among all nations, the prerequisite for which is to guarantee the sovereign equality of the people of large and small countries.

The people of Latin America, with Cuba at the forefront, and the people who are fighting for peace have united. They sympathize with and admire the Chinese people and express their determination to strengthen the fraternal friendly relations between them.”

Andrés Cantillo Murillo, Vice-President of the Panamanian Democratic Revolution Alliance, who came to Cuba to participate in the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America, also sent a congratulatory telegram to the China-Latin America Friendship Association, which said: “With democratic enthusiasm and confidence in the highest destiny of mankind, we congratulate the establishment of the China-Latin America Friendship Association. As we believe, this happens to coincide with the holding of the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America in Cuba, which is even more encouraging. The Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America is an active action on the road to resolutely strive for the political, social and economic liberation of the people of Latin America.”

The telegram pointed out: “In Panama, one day, the heroic peasants and proletarians, with the support of the people of the world, will rise up in a way that will shock the world to reclaim the wealth they are being plundered of today: their sovereignty over the Canal Zone and the Canal, their freedom and wealth in other parts of the country.”

Francisco García, the organizational secretary of the National Executive Committee of the Cultural Center, an organization of Spanish Republicans exiled in Cuba who participated in the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America, also sent a congratulatory telegram saying: “The Cultural Center warmly congratulates the establishment of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, which will bring great benefits to mankind fighting for peace, independence and the sovereignty of the people.”

    古巴支援拉丁美洲人民周筹委会等团体电贺中国—拉丁美洲友好协会成立
    新华社哈瓦那17日电  古巴支援拉丁美洲人民周筹备委员会对外联络书记处今晚向中国—拉丁美洲友好协会发出贺电，贺电全文如下：
    “支援拉丁美洲人民周筹备委员会执行委员会向正在召开大会成立中国—拉丁美洲友好协会的中国人民致以兄弟般的祝贺。以古巴人民为前列的马蒂的美洲人民，在反对他们的共同敌人美帝国主义的继续不断的侵略活动的伟大行动中，展开了争取充分的主权和使人民群众完全享用自己富源的剧烈斗争。
    虽然在古巴推翻了巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，在委内瑞拉推翻了希门尼斯独裁政权，在秘鲁推翻了奥德利亚独裁政权，在哥伦比亚推翻了罗哈斯·皮尼亚独裁政权，在美洲和世界上仍然存在着受帝国主义支持和鼓励的特鲁希略（多米尼加）、斯特罗斯纳（巴拉圭）、杜瓦利埃（海地）和索摩查（尼加拉瓜）的血腥的独裁政权。拉丁美洲人民在推翻这些独裁者的团结一致的行动中，正作出他们的贡献和给予他们的支持。
    在我们历史的有决定意义的时刻中，我们怀着深深感谢的心情，得到了光荣的中国人民的一致支持。中国人民已经顺利地打败了过去整个世纪中压迫他们的帝国主义势力，并且在大跃进中朝气蓬勃地缔造着一个完全掌握自己命运的国家，为自己儿女的幸福而不倦地进行工作，同时为各国人民的和平共处事业作出了巨大的贡献，而这种和平共处的前提条件是保证大小国家人民的主权平等。
    以古巴为前列的拉丁美洲人民和为和平而斗争的人民已经团结起来，他们同情和钦佩中国人民，并且表示决心加强彼此间兄弟般的友好关系。”
    前来古巴参加支援拉丁美洲人民周的巴拿马民主革命同盟的副主席安德烈斯·坎蒂略·穆里略也向中国—拉丁美洲友好协会发出了贺电，贺电说：“我们满怀民主的热情和对人类最高命运的信心，祝贺中国—拉丁美洲友好协会的成立。正像我们所认为的那样，这正好是发生在古巴支援拉丁美洲人民周将要举行的时候，这就更加令人鼓舞，支援拉丁美洲人民周是坚决争取拉丁美洲人民政治、社会和经济解放道路上的有积极作用的行动。”
    电文指出：“在巴拿马，总有一天，英勇的农民和无产阶级将在全世界人民的支持下，使世界震惊地起来收回他们今天被掠夺的财富：他们对运河区和运河的主权，他们的自由和在全国其他各地的财富。”
    参加支援拉丁美洲人民周的流亡在古巴的西班牙共和人士的组织——文化之家的全国执行委员会组织书记弗朗西斯科·加西亚也发出贺电说：“文化之家热烈祝贺中国—拉丁美洲友好协会的成立，这将给为和平、独立和人民主权而斗争的人类带来巨大利益。”
