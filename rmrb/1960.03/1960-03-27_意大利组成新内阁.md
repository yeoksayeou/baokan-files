Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 26th: Tambroni, the former Budget Minister in the Italian Segni government, who was entrusted with forming a new government, announced yesterday the formation of a new, exclusively Christian Democratic government.

From the already published list of the new government, this government is very similar to the previous Segni government: only four new members among the twenty-two ministers, and twelve ministers even retained their original positions, including the Minister of Defense, Andreotti.

Former Foreign Minister Pella did not participate in the new government. The new government's Foreign Minister will be former Prime Minister Segni.

So far, the new government has not yet put forward a policy program. The list of this new government must be submitted to Parliament for approval within ten days. Italian newspapers today all expressed doubts that the Tambroni government would be able to gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies. Apart from the three right-wing parties, the Liberal Party, the Monarchist Party, and the neo-fascist party, all other parties have announced that they will vote against the new government. The three right-wing parties said they would decide on their attitude after the new government announced its program.

    意大利组成新内阁
    据新华社26日讯　罗马消息：受命组织新政府的意大利前塞尼政府的预算部长塔姆布罗尼，昨天宣布组成了一个新的清一色的天主教民主党政府。
    从已经发表的新政府的名单看来，这个政府同前塞尼政府非常相像：在二十二个部长中只有四个新的成员，有十二个部长甚至连原来的职位也没有变动，其中包括国防部长安德雷奥蒂。
    前任外交部长贝拉没有参加新政府。新政府的外交部长将由前总理塞尼担任。
    到现在为止，新政府还没有提出施政纲领。这个新政府的名单要在十天内提交议会批准。意大利报纸今天都对塔姆布罗尼政府能够在众议院得到信任表示怀疑。除了自由党、保皇党和新法西斯党三个右翼政党外，其他党派都已经宣布要投票反对新政府。三个右翼政党说要到新政府宣布纲领后才决定态度。
