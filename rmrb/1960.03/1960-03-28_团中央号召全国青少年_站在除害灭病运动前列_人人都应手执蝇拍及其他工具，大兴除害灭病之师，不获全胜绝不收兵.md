Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a notice to young people nationwide on March 26th regarding continuing to vigorously carry out the patriotic health campaign. The notice called on young people nationwide to immediately mobilize and, together with the people of the entire country, continue to launch an even larger-scale campaign to eliminate the four pests (rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes) and other serious epidemic diseases, in order to enhance the people's physical fitness, energetically engage in labor, work, and study, and better promote the sustained great leap forward of socialist construction.

The notice stated that carrying out the patriotic health campaign is a great undertaking to transform customs and habits and change the world, with great effects, far-reaching significance, and related to the healthy growth of our nation and future generations. The patriotic health campaign is the most extensive and intensive mass movement, which is also a movement to benefit mankind and a movement for young people to demonstrate their talents. Through this movement, the revolutionary spirit of young people can be invigorated, the ambition of diligence, courage, and communism can be established, and the confidence and courage to conquer and transform nature can be enhanced. It can further cultivate the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people among young people, and their willingness to contribute to public welfare and the collective, thereby building our motherland into a strong, prosperous, and noble country. Therefore, the patriotic health campaign is also an important aspect of conducting communist education for young people. The vast number of young people in our country must resolutely respond to the call of the Party, stand at the forefront of this movement, and become the most active and courageous shock force. We should promote it vigorously, publicize it widely, make it known to every household, and create a momentum where everyone participates in eliminating the four pests, every household emphasizes hygiene, and young people take the lead. Every young person should wield fly swatters and other tools, launch a massive campaign to eliminate pests and prevent diseases, and never cease until complete victory is achieved. Every young person should develop good hygiene habits, bathe and wash clothes frequently, and resolutely refrain from spitting and defecating anywhere. We should not only take care of personal hygiene, but more importantly, we should also care about and take care of public and collective hygiene, and regard improving environmental hygiene and beautifying public places as a glorious task. Young managers and cooks in public canteens should strive to ensure that food is clean and hygienic, ensuring that people eat hot meals, drink boiled water, and do not eat spoiled food. Young medical personnel should establish a working attitude of wholeheartedly serving the people, and go deep into construction sites, dormitories, canteens, etc., to carry out mobile medical care, rescue, and prevention work. Young breeders should pay special attention to hygiene in livestock breeding to reduce the incidence and mortality of livestock. In order to effectively improve health and enhance physical fitness, we must also carry out a variety of sports activities while eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. Young people should insist on physical exercise every day and actively participate in gymnastics, ball games, running, climbing, swimming, and other activities.

The notice also required that the organizations of the Communist Youth League at all levels must quickly mobilize and, under the leadership of the Party, invest in this mass movement of the whole people. Whether carrying out health campaigns or sports activities, we must closely cooperate with production and serve production, and we must vigorously carry out mass movements. We must widely establish models, plant red flags, and be good at quickly summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, holding on-site meetings or activist representative meetings, conducting evaluations, and giving appropriate commendations and rewards to advanced collectives and individuals. Local grassroots Communist Youth League organizations should carry out several concentrated and large-scale assault activities every year under the unified deployment of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and should adhere to regular hygiene work.

The notice concluded by saying: Due to the further consolidation and development of rural people's communes, and the rapid and large-scale organization of the economic life of urban people, this has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for carrying out the patriotic health campaign. Let us hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely fight, work hard, and strive to make more significant achievements in eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene within two or three years.

    新华社27日讯　共青团中央26日向全国青少年发出了关于继续大力开展爱国卫生运动的通知，号召全国青少年应当立即动员起来，和全国人民一道，继续掀起更大规模的除四害讲卫生的运动。进一步地消灭四害（老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子）和其它严重的流行疾病，以增强人民的体质，精力充沛地去从事劳动、工作和学习，更好地促进社会主义建设的持续大跃进。
    通知说开展爱国卫生运动是一件伟大的移风易俗，改造世界的工作，作用很大，意义深远，关系到我国民族和整个后代的健康成长。爱国卫生运动是一个最广泛并具有突击性的群众运动，这也是为人类造福的运动，也是青少年大显身手的运动，通过这一运动，可以振奋青少年的革命精神，树立勤劳勇敢和共产主义的雄心壮志，增强征服自然改造自然的信心和勇气。可以进一步培养青少年的全心全意为人民服务的思想，乐于为公共福利、为集体贡献力量，从而把我们的祖国建设成为强大的、繁荣的、高尚的国家，因而爱国卫生运动也是对青少年进行共产主义教育一个重要方面。我国广大的青年少年，必须坚决响应党的号召，站在这个运动的前列，成为最活跃、最勇敢的突击力量。应当大张旗鼓，大做宣传，使得家喻户晓，造成人人动手除四害，家家户户讲卫生，青年少年打先锋的声势。每个青年少年，都应当手执蝇拍及其他工具，大兴除害灭病之师，不获全胜，绝不收兵。每个青年少年都应当养成良好的卫生习惯，勤洗澡、勤洗衣，坚决做到不随地吐痰和大小便。我们不但要搞好个人卫生，更重要的是还要关心并搞好公共卫生和集体卫生，把改善环境卫生和美化公共场所当作一项光荣的任务。公共食堂的青年管理员、炊事员，要努力做到饮食清洁卫生，保证人们吃热饭、喝开水、不吃腐烂食物。青年医务人员要树立全心全意为人民服务的工作态度，深入工地、宿舍、食堂等，开展巡回医疗、救护和预防工作。青年饲养员要特别注意牲畜饲养中的卫生工作，减少牲畜的发病和死亡率。为了有效地改善健康状况，增强体质，在除四害、讲卫生的同时，还必须开展多种多样的体育活动。青年少年都应当天天坚持体育锻炼，积极参加做体操、打球类、跑跑步、爬山、游泳等项目。
    通知还要求各级团的组织，必须迅速动员起来，在党的领导下，投入这个全民性的群众运动。无论是开展卫生运动和体育活动，都必须紧密配合生产，为生产服务，要轰轰烈烈地大搞群众运动。要广树标兵，大插红旗，善于迅速地总结和推广先进经验，召开现场会议或积极分子代表会议，进行评比，对先进集体和个人给予适当的表扬奖励。各地基层团组织要在爱国卫生运动委员会的统一部署下，每年开展几次力量集中声势浩大的突击活动，并且要坚持经常的卫生工作。
    通知最后说：由于农村人民公社的进一步巩固和发展，城市人民的经济生活正在迅速地大规模地组织起来，这就给开展爱国卫生运动造成了空前有利的条件。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，在除四害、讲卫生的工作中，英勇奋斗，大干特干，力求在两三年内做出更显著的成绩来。
