    Don't Be a Handout Seeker!
    Hong Shichang
    After reading the report in the newspaper about the Shenyang Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory starting from scratch and innovating technology at high speed, my excited mood could not calm down for a long time.
    A little over a year ago, the Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory was just a factory merged from those making hemp rope, pasting paper boxes, and repairing large vehicles. In terms of equipment, at that time there were only two broken lathes; in terms of manpower, only more than five hundred people, and 80% were originally housewives; in terms of technical strength, there was not a single technician. In the eyes of some people, this is a factory with "very poor conditions." However, now they have independently manufactured more than one hundred machines, and most of the operations have been mechanized and semi-mechanized, becoming a factory with an annual output of 100,000 sets of steel ball bearings and 10 million steel balls. Now, this factory is advancing with high morale towards single-machine automation and semi-automation!
    This example is inspiring and thought-provoking.
    What is the reason that enabled them to achieve such great achievements? It is revolutionary drive plus technological innovation. They really had "very poor conditions," very poor, but "poverty leads to change," they have the ambition to change from poor to rich. Poor, then work! Self-reliance, arming themselves, not being handout seekers. If you don't know how, then learn! Study diligently and practice hard, learn while doing, and improve technology through learning. If there is nothing, go find it, do it yourself. Finally, "where there is a will, there is a way," creating miracles! This spirit is valuable, this style is the communist style. Some units, some comrades, when it comes to technological innovation and technological revolution, when talking about mechanization and semi-mechanization, make requests: "Give us some equipment!" "Solve some labor for us!" "Give us..." Since it is to engage in innovation, make revolution, just asking the superiors to "give," then what do we "innovate"? Comrades who like to say "give us..." if they learn more from the Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory's ambition to change from poor to rich, the spirit of self-reliance, the style of daring to think and dare to do, they will definitely aspire not to be handout seekers.

    不当伸手派！
    洪世昌
    读了报上沈阳大东区钢珠轴承厂白手起家高速度革新技术的报道，我激动的心情久久不能平静。
    大东区钢珠轴承厂一年多以前还是由纺麻绳、糊纸盒、修大车合并起来的厂子。论设备，当时只两台破床子；论人力，不过五百多人，而且，80％原来是家庭妇女；论技术力量，一个技术人员也没有。这在有些人看来，是一个“条件很差”的厂子。但是，现在他们已自力更生制造了一百多台机器，大部分操作实现了机械化、半机械化，成为一个年产十万套钢珠轴承和一千万粒钢珠的工厂。现在，这个厂正斗志昂扬地向单机自动化、半自动化方向前进！
    这个事例使人受到鼓舞，令人深思。
    是什么原因使他们取得这样大的成就呢？是革命干劲加技术革新。他们确实“条件很差”，很穷，但是，“穷则思变”，他们有由穷变富的雄心壮志。穷，就干！自力更生，自己武装自己，不当伸手派。不会，就学！勤学苦练，在干中学，从学中提高技术。没有东西，就去找，自己动手搞。终于，“有志者事竟成”，创造了奇迹！这种精神是可贵的，这种风格，是共产主义的风格。有的单位，有的同志，一提技术革新和技术革命，一谈机械化、半机械化，就提出要求：“给我们一些设备吧！”“给我们解决一些劳动力吧！”“给我们……”既然是搞革新，闹革命，只是要求上级“给”，那还要我们“革”个什么？爱说“给我们……”的同志，如果多多学习大东区钢珠轴承厂由穷到富的雄心壮志，自力更生的精神，敢想敢干的风格，就一定会立志不当伸手派了。
