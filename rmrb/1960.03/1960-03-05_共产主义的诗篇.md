    A Communist Poem
    Poetry excels at expressing thoughts and feelings. Poetic and picturesque imagery can be thought-provoking and captivating. "Eight Million Female Workers Make a Big Fuss About Technical Revolution" is a moving poem. But it does not come from the pen of a poet, but from the active actions of eight million women. It sings not of ancient heroes, but of the heroic sisters of the 1960s; it depicts not general landscapes and figures, but the great communist style. It is a communist poem! The artistic conception it gives people is not yesterday, nor only today, but also a beautiful future!
    Now, although it is still the first year of the 1960s, Wei Fengying, Ma Lizhen, Liu Yajun, and others have already entered 1969, 1965, and 1963! Nine years, five years, three years, how much firm perseverance and condensed wisdom is in this! Without the spirit of communism, how could people imagine it! Red Banner Holder Cao Huiju took the initiative to exchange her light and flexible machine for Kong Zili's and personally helped her master the technology. In this way, Kong Zili also won the title of Red Banner Holder. Without the style of communism, how could this be imagined! The communist spirit and the communist style are the characteristics of the Mao Zedong era and the characteristics of our heroic era. Female heroes like Wei Fengying, Ma Lizhen, Liu Yajun, and Cao Huiju represent the heroic sons and daughters of the Mao Zedong era. Millions of heroic sons and daughters gallop within the four seas and are distributed in all walks of life.
    At present, China's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage. Sisters, we must greatly promote the communist style, and under the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, work with our brothers to write more beautiful and better communist poems for the great cause of socialism and communism with our own hands!

    共产主义的诗篇
    诗，善于抒发思想感情。诗情画意，能发人深省，引人入胜。“八百万女职工大闹技术革命”，是一首感人的诗篇。但它不是出自诗人之笔，而是出于八百万妇女的积极行动。它歌颂的不是古代的英雄人物，而是六十年代的英雄姊妹；描写的不是一般的山水人物，而是伟大的共产主义风格。它是一首共产主义的诗篇！它给人们的意境，不是昨天，也不仅是现在，还有美好的将来！
    现在，虽然还是六十年代的第一年，但是，尉凤英、马丽珍、刘雅君等等已经走入了1969年，1965年，1963年！九年，五年，三年，这里面有着多么坚强的毅力，凝结着多少智慧啊！没有共产主义的精神，岂能令人设想！红旗手曹慧菊，把自己轻巧灵活的机器，主动换给孔自力，还亲手帮助她掌握技术。这样，孔自力也获得了红旗手的称号。没有共产主义的风格，这又岂能令人设想！共产主义的精神，共产主义的风格，是毛泽东时代的特征，是我们英雄时代的特征。尉凤英，马丽珍，刘雅君，曹慧菊这样的女英雄代表了毛泽东时代的英雄儿女。千百万英雄儿女驰骋在四海之内，遍布在各行各业之中。
    目前，我国技术革新和技术革命运动，已跨入新的阶段。姊妹们，我们要大大发扬共产主义的风格，在党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，同兄弟们一道，用我们的双手，为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业写出更美、更好的共产主义诗篇！
