    A Rallying Cry for Latin American Unity
    Kong Mai
    The tribute to the Latin American people held in Havana on the 20th was a rally for the united struggle of the Latin American people against their common enemy – US imperialism, and also a rally in support of the Cuban revolution.
    Outstanding representatives of the people of Latin American countries, from the Rio Grande in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south, gathered in Cuba, a country of revolution and struggle, to participate in rallies during Latin American People's Support Week. Among them were rebel soldiers carrying out land reform in rural Cuba; worker leaders from Mexico; peace fighters from the banks of the Rio de la Plata and the foothills of the Andes; patriots from Nicaragua, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and other countries who are waging heroic struggles against the puppet dictatorships supported by the United States; and the wife of Campos, the leader of the Puerto Rican independence movement who is imprisoned. They share the same suffering, the same feelings, and a common language.
    In the auditorium where the conference was held, the flags of Latin American countries were hung, and all the representatives condemned the enslavement and plunder of Latin American countries by US imperialism with pain and anger.
    Captain Emilio Aragones, leader of the Cuban "July 26th Movement," historically exposed the crimes of American aggression against Latin American countries in his opening speech. In a century, the United States has organized more than a hundred interventions and coups in Latin American countries. History proves that the US Marines who occupied the Dominican Republic also invaded Uruguay; it was the American claws that killed the great anti-imperialist fighter Sandino of Nicaragua that killed Brazilian President Vargas; and it was the same American ambassador who undermined land reform in Bolivia who was sent to Cuba today to undermine this country's land reform.
    The United States has placed the economic shackles of single products on the Latin American people, sucking their blood like octopuses. US monopoly capital carries out brutal exploitation in these countries through sugar in Cuba, coffee in Brazil, tin in Bolivia, oil in Venezuela, bananas in Guatemala...
    The United States is now wearing masks of "friendship, goodwill, aid and peace," etc., but this cannot deceive anyone. The bloody lessons that the Latin American people have personally experienced over the past century, as well as the current American conspiracies to interfere in and invade Cuba, have made the Latin American people clearly understand who their common enemy is. As Cuban Captain Emilio said when summarizing the United States' crimes of aggression: There are no enemies between Latin American countries; Latin American countries have a common enemy: imperialism in the north, and our countries' struggle for a second independence should be directed against it.
    This is the common understanding and call of the Latin American people. Toledano, chairman of the Latin American Labor Alliance, said that like the Americas, Africa, and Asia, its enemy is imperialism, and US imperialism attempts to become the master of our countries. The struggle should be universal. Any country that defeats US imperialism is an aid to other countries.”
    Tulio Avilo, an anti-dictatorial fighter from the Dominican Republic, said at the conference: "The most arduous struggle of the Dominican people is not against Trujillo, but against the supporters of this tyrant, because the common enemy of people all over the world is US imperialism."
    The struggle for freedom and independence has formed a historical tradition of mutual support among the people of Latin American countries. Argentine national hero San Martin and Chilean national hero O'Higgins fought side by side to liberate Chile from Spanish colonial rule; Dominican General Maximo Gomez fought alongside Cuban Jose Marti. Patriots from Argentina and Venezuela helped the Cuban people in the Sierra Maestra to overthrow the tyranny of Batista. Porfirio Gonzalez, an old man with white hair from Puerto Rico, said excitedly on the rostrum of the conference that his three brothers had given their lives in Matanzas Province during the Cuban War of Independence. Today, the struggle of the victorious Cuban people is also an aid to the Puerto Rican people who are suffering from American colonial rule. He said that although he is over seventy years old, he will once again go to the battlefield to defend Cuba if necessary.
    The victory of the Cuban Revolution heralds the birth of a new Latin America. Haitian poet René Depestre said at the conference that for Haiti, Cuba is an example of gaining freedom. Armando Amador, the representative of Nicaragua, said that the example of the Cuban people has awakened the fighting spirit of the Nicaraguan people. The road Nicaragua is going to take is the road of Cuba. The representatives said in unison at the conference: "We warn the invaders that any economic or military aggression against Cuba is an aggression against the people of Latin American countries, and we will never allow the heinous events of Guatemala to be repeated!"
    This call not only resounded through the conference hall, but also spread throughout Latin America. When the people's representatives of Latin American countries gathered in Havana, mothers in Uruguay, workers in Venezuela, students in Mexico, and residents of the capital of Costa Rica all held meetings, and they unanimously shouted: Get out of Cuba! Defending Cuba is defending Latin America! Workers in China, students in North Korea, dockworkers in Indonesia, youth in Czechoslovakia, and guerrillas in Algeria also extended their hands of support to the people of Latin America and Cuba. In their telegrams to the conference, they unanimously stated: Latin American brothers and Cuban brothers, we people all over the world firmly stand on the side of your just struggle.

### 拉丁美洲团结的誓师大会

    拉丁美洲团结的誓师大会
    孔迈
    20日下午在哈瓦那举行的向拉丁美洲人民致敬大会，是拉丁美洲人民团结斗争、反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义的誓师大会，也是声援古巴革命的大会。
    北起格朗德河、南到火地岛的拉丁美洲各国人民的杰出代表，汇集到古巴这个革命和战斗的国度里，来参加支援拉丁美洲人民周的集会。他们当中有在古巴农村进行土地改革的起义军战士；有来自墨西哥的工人领袖；有来自拉普拉塔河畔和安达斯山脚下的和平战士；有来自尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭、多米尼加和海地等国正在对美国扶植的傀儡独裁政权进行英勇斗争的爱国者；有被关在监狱中的波多黎各独立运动的领导人坎波斯的妻子。他们有着同样的苦难，具有同样的感情和共同的语言。
    在举行大会的这个大礼堂里，悬挂着拉丁美洲各国的国旗，所有的代表都怀着痛苦和愤怒的心情，谴责美帝国主义对拉丁美洲国家的奴役和掠夺。
    古巴“7月26日运动”领导人埃米略·阿拉戈内斯上尉在开幕词中从历史上揭露了美国侵略拉丁美洲的罪行。在一个世纪当中，美国在拉丁美洲国家中组织了一百多次干涉活动和政变。历史证明：占领过多米尼加的美国海军陆战队也侵入过乌拉圭；正是杀害了尼加拉瓜伟大的反帝战士桑地诺的美国魔爪杀害了巴西总统瓦加斯；也正是从前在玻利维亚破坏过土地改革的那位美国大使，今天又被派到古巴来破坏这个国家的土地改革。
    美国给拉丁美洲人民戴上了单一产品的经济枷锁，像鱆鱼一样吸吮他们的血液。美国垄断资本在古巴通过糖，在巴西通过咖啡，在玻利维亚通过锡，在委内瑞拉通过石油，在危地马拉通过香蕉……在这些国家进行残酷的剥削。
    美国现在戴着“亲善、友好、援助和和平”等等假面具，但是这也骗不了任何人。拉丁美洲人民在一个世纪中亲身经历的血的教训，以及美国目前干涉和侵略古巴的阴谋，这一切新仇旧恨使拉丁美洲人民清楚地懂得了谁是他们共同的敌人。正如古巴的埃米略上尉在总结美国的侵略罪行时所说的那样：拉丁美洲国家之间没有敌人；拉丁美洲各国有一个共同的敌人：北部的帝国主义，我们各国争取第二次独立的斗争应该针对着它。
    这是拉丁美洲人民共同的认识和呼声，拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺说，美洲和非洲及亚洲一样，它的敌人是帝国主义，美帝国主义企图成为我们各国的主人。斗争应该是普遍的。任何国家击败美帝国主义都是对其他国家的援助。”
    多米尼加反独裁战士图利奥·阿维洛在大会上说：“多米尼加人民最艰苦的斗争不是反对特鲁希略，而是反对这个暴君的支持者，因为全世界各国人民的共同敌人是美帝国主义。”
    争取自由和独立的斗争，形成了拉丁美洲各国人民互相支援的历史传统。阿根廷民族英雄圣马丁和智利民族英雄沃伊京斯，为把智利从西班牙殖民统治下解放出来而并肩进行过斗争；多米尼加的马西莫·戈麦斯将军同古巴的何塞·马蒂在一起进行过斗争。阿根廷和委内瑞拉的爱国者在马埃斯特腊山区帮助古巴人民进行了推翻巴蒂斯塔暴政统治的斗争。波多黎各的白发老人波尔菲里奥·冈萨雷斯在大会的讲坛上激动地说：他的三个弟兄都在古巴的独立战争中在马坦萨斯省献出了生命。今天获得胜利的古巴人民的斗争，也是对遭受美国殖民统治的波多黎各人民的援助。他说，虽然他已经七十多岁了，但是在必要的时候，他将再一次走上战场保卫古巴。
  古巴革命的胜利宣告一个新的拉丁美洲将要诞生。海地诗人雷纳·德佩斯特在大会上说，对海地来说，古巴是一个获得自由的榜样。尼加拉瓜的代表阿曼多·阿马多尔说，古巴人民的榜样唤起了尼加拉瓜人民的斗争精神。尼加拉瓜要走的道路就是古巴的道路。 代表们在大会上异口同声地说：“我们警告侵略者，对古巴的任何 经济或军事侵略都是对拉丁美洲各国人民的侵略，我们决不允许重演危地马拉的罪恶事件！”
    这个呼声不仅响彻了举行会议的大礼堂，而且遍及全拉丁美洲。当拉丁美洲国家的人民代表在哈瓦那集会的时候，乌拉圭的母亲们、委内瑞拉的工人们、墨西哥的学生们和哥斯达黎加首都的居民们，都举行了会议，他们一致高呼：滚出古巴去！保卫古巴就是保卫拉丁美洲！中国的工人、朝鲜的学生、印度尼西亚的码头工人、捷克斯洛伐克的青年以及阿尔及利亚的游击战士，也向拉丁美洲和古巴人民伸出了支援的手。他们在给大会的电报中，一致表示：拉丁美洲的兄弟们和古巴的兄弟们，我们全世界人民坚决站在你们的正义斗争这一边。
