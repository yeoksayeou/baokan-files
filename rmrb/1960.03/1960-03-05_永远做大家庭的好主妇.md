　　Always Be a Good Housewife in a Large Family
　　Li Xiaoguo, Cook at the Ziyan Production Team Canteen, Chengguan Commune, Xinle, Hebei

　　Our canteen was established during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. At that time, there were many people and few workers in our village. Some commune members cooked together, and everyone thought it was a good idea. So, the Party branch led the commune members to set up six canteens. As soon as the canteen was established, the Party branch assigned me to be a cook. At the time, I was a little unwilling. I thought to myself: Setting up a canteen means I should be working efficiently, but now they want me to cook, isn't that the same as being stuck at the stove as before? The Party branch secretary said to me, "Don't be picky, everyone thinks you're capable, that's why they asked you to cook!" I thought about it carefully, and it made sense. There are more than a thousand people in the team, and they have to eat every day. If no one is a cook, what will everyone eat? So, I agreed. Since I'm doing it, I want to do it well, but who has ever cooked for so many people? Sometimes there's too much, sometimes too little; sometimes it's too thick, sometimes too thin; sometimes it's too bland, sometimes too salty. But the commune members were so happy to have ready-made meals. If the food wasn't to their liking, everyone forgave us, saying that we would get better at it. But when I saw some commune members frowning while eating, I felt bad and didn't want to do it anymore. But when I thought about it, this was a task assigned by the leadership, how could I just quit? As the saying goes, "There's no Flame Mountain you can't cross." As long as I work harder, I don't believe I can't overcome the difficulties. Thinking of this, my energy came back.

　　In order to let the commune members eat their fill and eat well, I cooked while discussing with other cooks. We went to each household to solicit opinions and learned from people who knew how to cook. At the same time, the canteen also set up an opinion book to widely solicit opinions from the masses. I couldn't sleep at night, and I thought of ways to be both economical and delicious. After this bit-by-bit improvement, our canteen reached the point where we didn't repeat a meal for seven days, and there was both porridge and dry food every day. The commune members were so happy that they composed a quick-rhythm verse to praise us: "Six steamed, five stir-fried, twelve dry, eight soups, four porridges, delicious and fresh, joy in the eyebrows, warmth in the heart." The cooks heard this and couldn't close their mouths with joy, and wanted to cook even better. I wanted to do well, but my energy was always limited. Every day we changed the menu, every day we had to go to work early in the morning, and we couldn't leave the kitchen until after midnight. When we improved the food, we were even more tired, with sore backs and legs, and we didn't even want to eat. I thought, this won't do. If the commune members can find tricks in the fields, can't we reform the work in the canteen? Later, I came up with the idea of making a shredding machine. If this could be done, it could save a lot of manpower. After the Party branch knew about it, they immediately sent blacksmiths and carpenters to help. After making one for testing, it could only shave off small pieces and couldn't shred. At this time, there were rumors: "If a dung beetle can make honey, who would raise bees!" When I heard this, I felt like I was stabbed with a knife. The branch secretary comforted and encouraged me: "Aunt Xiaoguo, don't listen to the rumors. It's not easy to be creative. If it doesn't work once, keep working on it. The Party will definitely support you." So, the second time I went to the carpenters and blacksmiths, and finally made the shredding machine in one go. After this, the cooks all started to be creative. Now, our village's six canteens have reformed and created twenty-one kinds of cooking utensils, ninety-nine pieces, realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of cooking utensils, achieving: no need to carry water, no need to use knives to cut vegetables, no need to use ladles to wash vegetables, no need to use bellows to cook, no need to use rolling pins to make noodles, and machines to process rice and flour.

　　After the reform of cooking equipment, the team's six canteens, which previously had seventy-two cooks, now only need thirty-three people. Rice and flour processing has been reduced from sixty-four people and sixty-four livestock to four livestock and five people. The working hours of the cooks have been shortened. Now they get off work at 7 pm every night, and there are two hours of rest at noon. This not only gives everyone time to study politics and culture, but also the energy to come up with more food varieties. As soon as spring arrives, we use part of our rest time to collect various leaves and wild vegetables, and make vegetable buns with locust flowers, elm leaves, and shepherd's purse. We also learned the grain increase method after making yam into powder, fermenting the powder residue, and using 70% powder residue and 30% flour to make dry food. As a result, the team saved 150,000 catties of grain last year.

　　Seeing this scene, I felt that the responsibility of the cooks was even greater, and I wanted to do everything possible to make the commune members eat well. Every time I ate, I watched carefully to see who didn't want to eat and who didn't come to eat, and secretly wrote it down. If someone didn't come to eat because of something, I would leave them food. For those who didn't want to eat, I would ask for their opinion afterwards, asking them why they didn't want to eat, and whether the food was not to their liking. For those who were sick and couldn't come to eat, I would take the initiative to deliver the food to their homes. Under the education and help of the Party, I gloriously joined the Communist Party last year. In the future, I will definitely serve the people better and always be a good housewife in our commune's large family.

    永远做大家庭的好主妇
    河北新乐城关公社紫烟生产队食堂炊事员　李小果
    俺们的食堂是1958年大跃进中成立的。那时，俺们村活多人少，有的社员就搭伙作饭，大家一看都觉着好，于是党支部就领导社员办了六个食堂。食堂一成立，党支部就分配我当炊事员，当时我有些不愿意。心想：办起食堂，可该我利利索索干活了，现在又叫我作饭，还不是跟从前一样围着锅台转吗？党支部书记就对我说：“不要挑挑拣拣的，大家看你能干才让你作呢！”我仔细一想，也是这么回事。全队一千多人，天天要吃饭，要都不当炊事员，大家吃饭怎么办呢？于是我就答应了。既然干，就愿意干好，可谁作过这么多人的饭啊？不是多，就是少，不是稠，就是稀，不是淡，就是咸。但社员们吃上了现成饭，都高兴得不行，作得不合口味，大家都原谅我们，都说慢慢就会作好的。可我一看见有的社员吃饭皱眉头，心里就不好受，就又不愿干了；但一想到这是领导上交下来的任务，怎么可以随便不干呢？常言道：“没有过不去的火焰山”，只要多加把劲，我就不信不能克服困难。想到这里，自己的劲头又来了。
    为了让社员吃饱吃好，我一边作饭，一边就跟别的炊事员商量。我们到各户去征求意见，找会作饭的人学习；同时，食堂还设立了意见本，广泛征求群众意见。我晚上躺到炕上睡不着觉，也想些既节约又好吃的办法。经过这样一点一滴的改进，我们食堂达到七天不吃重样饭，每天有稀又有干。社员们一高兴就编快板表扬我们：“六蒸五炒十二干，八汤四稀美味鲜，粗粮细作千百样，喜在眉头暖心间。”我们炊事员听见了，喜得合不上嘴，越是想法往好处作。心里愿意干好可精神总是有限的。天天变花样，天天得赶大早上班，不到半夜离不了伙房；赶上改善伙食，我们更累得腰酸腿疼，饭也不想吃。我想，这样下去不行。社员们在地里生产能找窍门，我们食堂工作就不能改革吗？后来我想了个制擦丝机的主意，这要搞成功，就可以省很多人力。党支部知道以后马上派铁匠和木匠来帮忙，制成了一试验，光能刨出小片片，擦不成丝。这时就有闲话了：“屎壳螂能作蜜谁还养蜂啊！”我一听，心里像刀子扎一样难受。支部书记却安慰鼓励我：“小果婶子，你不要听闲话，搞创造不是容易的事，一次不成功，继续搞下去，党一定支持你。”于是第二次我又去找木匠铁匠，一鼓气终于制成了擦丝机。这以后，炊事员们就都大搞起创造来了。现在俺们村六个食堂，已改制和创造炊具二十一种，九十九件，实现了炊具半机械化和机械化，做到：打水不用挑，切菜不用刀，洗菜不用笊篱捞，作饭不用风箱烧，吃面不用擀杖压，米面加工机器搞。
    作饭家具改革后，队里六个食堂，早先七十二个炊事员，如今三十三人就行了。米面加工由六十四人和六十四头牲口减到了四头牲口和五个人。炊事员们的工作时间缩短了。现在每天晚上七点就下班了，中午还有两小时休息。这一来大家不仅有了学习政治文化的时间，也有精力搞出更多的饭菜花样。春天一到，我们就利用一部分休息时间去采集各种树叶、野菜，用槐花、榆叶、曲曲菜等作成菜包子；又把山药出粉后，将粉渣发酵，用七成粉渣三成面作成干粮，我们又学会了粮食增量法。结果，去年全队节约了粮食十五万斤。
    我看到这情景，越觉得炊事员的责任大，更是千方百计地想要社员吃好。每次吃饭时，我就留神看谁不想吃饭，谁没来吃饭，暗中记下来。有事没来吃的，就给留下饭菜。对不想吃的，事后就去征求他的意见，问他为什么不想吃，是不是饭菜不合味。对有病不能来吃的人，我就主动把饭菜给送到家里去。在党的教育帮助下，我在去年光荣地参加了共产党。今后，我一定更要好好地为人民服务，永远做我们公社这个大家庭里的好主妇。
