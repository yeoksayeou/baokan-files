Breaking Boundaries for Great Collaboration
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Pu

"The relationship between Tongjialiang Store and the mine is one of division of labor but no boundaries, as close as family." This is a sentence spoken by Comrade Liu Sushan, secretary of the Tongjialiang Mine Committee of the Datong Coal Mine, in an article (see this newspaper, December 1, 1959). It is deeply imprinted in my mind. Whenever I hear or see cooperation between various departments, regions, and enterprises, I think of it. Today, after reading the news about the Yangpu District Banking Office in Shanghai organizing great collaboration between financial, transportation, and other departments and factories under the leadership of the district committee, as well as the news about Taiyuan City's collaborative use of raw materials, I thought of it again. "Division of labor but no boundaries, as close as family" profoundly reflects the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between people, between this part and that part, in socialist society.

Division of labor is an objective requirement for the development of social productive forces. The more developed social productive forces are, the more detailed the division of labor will be; this is an inevitable trend. However, no matter how detailed the division of labor, different departments are not a set of parallel lines, unrelated to each other, but several strands of a rope, intertwined, influencing, and promoting each other. The development of industry requires the corresponding development of agriculture, transportation, and commerce; agriculture, transportation, and commerce cannot develop in isolation from each other either. Especially in socialist society, various departments, various enterprises, and various workshops and groups are not only closely related in production, but also are components of the great cause of socialist construction. Whether it is industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, etc., it is not the cause of one department or a part of the people, but the common cause of the people of the whole country. If things are done well, 650 million people will benefit; if things are done poorly, 650 million people will suffer losses. Since they are all components of the great cause of socialist construction and the common cause of the people of the whole country, then what distinct boundaries are there between various departments, various enterprises, and various workshops and groups?

Where there is a division of labor, there must be collaboration. Divide labor under the principle of collaboration, and collaborate on the basis of division of labor. "Division of labor but no boundaries" is the unity of opposites between division of labor and collaboration, and also the unity of opposites between the part and the whole. We must not only see the side of division of labor, but also see the side of "no boundaries." Because there is a division of labor, we must do a good job within the scope of the division of labor—the work of the part. If there are difficulties, we must do everything possible to solve them ourselves, look inward, rely on our own efforts, and not depend on others. We must promote the overall situation by doing a good job in the part, and never let the part hold back the overall situation. Because there are "no boundaries," we must take into account the overall situation everywhere, care about the whole at all times, look outward, and regard the difficulties of others as our own. "When one family has trouble, everyone helps"; "Leave the difficulties to yourself and give the convenience to others." If you leave the difficulties, and I leave the difficulties, and everyone leaves the difficulties, then the difficulties will not be able to trap us. If you give convenience to others, I give convenience to others, and he also gives convenience to others, then everyone will feel convenient everywhere. If everyone acts in the spirit of "division of labor but no boundaries," they will get along with each other as closely as family, and the deeds of industrial and commercial collaboration like that of Tongjialiang Coal Mine and Tongjialiang Store, the deeds of Shanghai Yangpu District's great collaboration between industry, finance, and other departments to solve problems such as raw materials, materials, fuel, transportation, and funds, and the deeds of Taiyuan City's collaborative use of materials and raw materials, will become widespread, and the entire national economy can leap forward comprehensively and continuously.

Collaboration is the essence of socialism, and it is also a characteristic of socialism. In capitalist society, although different departments cannot develop in isolation from each other, due to the fundamental conflict of interests between different capitalist groups, there can be no real collaboration. There, division of labor is division of boundaries. In socialist society, there is not only comradely collaboration between departments, enterprises, workshops, groups, and workers who have direct relationships up and down, left and right, and before and after, but also comradely collaboration between departments, enterprises, workshops, groups, and workers who have no direct relationships. "Division of labor but no boundaries, as close as family," breaking down enterprise boundaries, breaking down industry boundaries, breaking down regional boundaries, going wherever there are difficulties, going to support others proactively, this is the style of our era, and it is also the style of communism.

### 打破界限大协作

    打破界限大协作
    王朴
    “同家梁商店和矿上的关系是，有分工，没界限，亲如一家人。”这是中共大同煤矿同家梁矿委员会书记刘素善同志在一篇文章（见1959年12月1日本报）里讲的一句话。它深深地印在我的脑海里。每当我听到或看到各个部门、各个地区、各个企业之间互相协作的时候，就想起它来。今天读了上海市杨浦区银行办事处在区委的领导下，组织财政、金融、交通等部门和工厂企业大协作的新闻，以及太原市协作利用原料材料的新闻，又想起了它。“有分工，没界限，亲如一家人”这句话深刻地反映着社会主义社会里人与人之间、这一部分和那一部分之间的互助合作关系。
    分工，这是社会生产力发展的客观要求。社会生产力越发展，分工越细，这是必然的趋势。然而工不管分得多细，不同的部门决不是一组平行线，互不相干，而是一根绳子的几股线，互相交织着，影响着，促进着。工业发展了，需要农业、交通运输业和商业等的相应发展；农业、交通运输业、商业等也不能彼此孤立发展。特别在社会主义社会，各个部门、各个企业、以及各个车间和小组，不仅生产上有着密切的内在联系，而且都是社会主义建设伟大事业的组成部分。工业也罢，农业、商业、交通运输业等等也罢，都不是一个部门、一部分人的事业，而是全国人民的共同事业。事情办好了，六亿五千万人民都得到好处；事情办坏了，受损失的也是六亿五千万人民。既然都是伟大的社会主义建设事业的组成部分，都是全国人民的共同事业，那么各个部门、各个企业，以及各个车间和小组之间，还有什么截然分开的界限呢？
    有分工就必有协作。在协作的原则下分工，在分工的基础上协作。“有分工，没界限”，这是分工和协作的对立统一，也是局部和整体的对立统一。我们既要看到有分工的一面，又要看到“没界限”的一面。因为有分工，所以就要做好分工范围内——局部的工作。有了困难，凡能自己解决的，一定要千方百计地自己解决，要眼睛向内，自力更生，不要依赖别人。要以做好局部的工作推动全局，决不要以局部拉全局的后腿。因为“没界限”，所以就要处处顾全大局，时时关心整体，眼睛向外，把别人的困难看做自己的困难。“一家有事，大家支援”；“困难留给自己，方便送给别人”。你把困难留下，我也把困难留下，大家都把困难留下，困难就难不住人了。你把方便送给别人，我把方便送给别人，他也把方便送给别人，于是大家到处都感到方便。大家都本着“有分工，没界限”的精神办事，彼此相处就亲如一家人，像同家梁煤矿和同家梁商店那样的工商协作的事迹，像上海杨浦区工业、财政、金融等部门那样大协作解决原料、材料、燃料、运输、资金等问题的事迹，像太原市那样协作使用材料原料的事迹，就会普遍出现，整个国民经济就可以全面地持续地跃进。
    协作是社会主义的本质，也是社会主义的特点。在资本主义社会，不同的部门之间虽然也不能彼此孤立发展，但由于不同的资本家集团之间存在着根本的利害冲突，不可能有真正的协作。在那里，分工就是分界。在社会主义社会，不仅上下、左右、前后有直接关系的部门、企业、车间、小组、工人之间有着同志式的协作，而且在没有直接关系的部门、企业、车间、小组、工人之间也有着同志式的协作。“有分工，没界限，亲如一家人”，纷纷打破企业界限，打破行业界限，打破地区界限，哪里有困难，闻风而去，主动支援别人，这就是我们这个时代的风格，也就是共产主义的风格。
