Technical Flowers Bloom on the Prairie
    --On the Tool Reform in the Evenk Autonomous Banner
    By Our Correspondent Bai Shulian

    In March, the prairie of the Evenk Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is still a scene of heavy winter with swirling snowflakes and whistling cold winds. However, the flowers of technical innovation are blooming in profusion, and good news is flying in like snowflakes from every corner. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups are using their rich wisdom to add a lot of spring to the Hulunbuir prairie.
    The Evenk, Mongolian, and other ethnic herdsmen who have lived on the border grassland of the motherland for many years are carrying out a broad and profound technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They are rapidly changing the backward tools used in production and life for thousands of years. On the vast grassland, stories of tool reform and anecdotes of technological innovation are circulating everywhere: "The East Sini River Sumu has created a large-headed feeder that can feed more than 20 lambs at a time, increasing efficiency by more than 20 times compared to feeding only one lamb at a time in the past." "The women of Baiyintohai have made three or four kinds of new tools such as lambing vehicles, and the maternity bed they created has been successful and will be tested in the hospital."...
    Comrade Mao Aohai, whom I met not long ago, told us: "It can be said that everyone in the Evenk Autonomous Banner is thinking about the issue of tool reform. As long as they feel that a certain tool does not meet the requirements of production and life, they will boldly reform it and create it. In about ten days or half a month, a new or reformed tool will appear..." This is not an exaggeration. I met Batu Menghe, a worker from the Banner Iron and Wood Factory, who is an old acquaintance of mine. He is a Buryat who put down his herding whip not long ago. "What new achievements have you made in technical innovation recently?" I asked him. "I have made a knife-pressing machine, which is four times more efficient than manual labor." While speaking, he took out a drawing from his pocket and told me: "I am now studying how to create another new tool." Batu Menghe can truly be called a champion of innovation, creating one piece after another. I deeply admire his style of daring to think and daring to act.
    The scale of the technical innovation movement in the Evenk Autonomous Banner is unprecedentedly large, and the vast majority of people are involved in this movement. In addition to experienced old workers and young lads, even women are using their brains and creating things. The felt-making machine created by Yang Jima can make a felt in one day, which is much more efficient than manual production. The wind-powered wool spinning machine created by the herding girl Mandula increases efficiency twenty times.
    As long as you take a casual look at the iron and wood factories in this banner and various communes, you can see countless tool models, drawings, and finished products of various sizes and types, such as hay rakes, hay stackers, water pumps, leather tanning machines, afforestation seeders, mobile livestock pens, and canvas water tanks. According to a person in charge of the Autonomous Banner, 1,600 newly created and reformed tools have been identified and promoted for use in 1959, with an average of one new or reformed tool for every six or seven people in the Banner. Among them, more than ten kinds of tools, such as the amphibious and snow vehicle, hay rake, hay stacker, soil drilling machine, double-hat saw, and hand-cranked waterwheel, have been transported to Beijing and Hohhot for exhibition. The Hulunbuir League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a field meeting on tool reform in pastoral areas here last year; this year, the Inner Mongolia Women's Federation will also hold a field meeting on women's technical innovation here.
    If you understand the history of the Evenk Autonomous Banner grassland, you will know how profound the party's call for technical innovation and technical revolution has had here. The legacy left to the grassland by the Japanese puppet regime and feudal reactionary rulers was ideological stagnation and cultural backwardness. Until 1957, only some individual regions and a small number of herdsmen had some grass cutting machines, small milk separators, sewing machines, etc. The vast majority of herdsmen still used backward tools. Every year, when preparing fodder for livestock to overwinter, they would cut it with sickles, handful by handful. Horses and "lele carts" (a kind of small wooden cart) have always been the only means of transportation here. Camel carts, which have long been widely used in other grasslands, only numbered twenty or thirty here, and other production and living utensils have also been passed down from generation to generation.
    Now the situation has completely changed. In every vast pasture and settlement, many permanent livestock sheds and pens have been built. In many livestock pens, there are also troughs made of willow branches or wooden boards. Scattered snow breakers and snow shovels are placed outside. Once there is a heavy snowfall disaster, the herdsmen use them to open up pastures and clear resting areas for livestock on "oter". In the past, horse-drawn grass cutting machines were only used once during the summer hay-cutting season. Now, the herdsmen have modified them and are using them to harvest reeds along the Huihe and Yimin Rivers, which are rich in reeds. In previous years, when herdsmen cut reeds manually, one person could only cut 600 catties a day, but now one grass cutting machine can cut more than 14,000 catties a day. In the autumn, when the feed bases on the grassland have a bumper harvest, the herdsmen also modify the horse-drawn grass cutting machines into grain harvesters to harvest crops and feed. The herdsmen call this "comprehensive utilization of grass cutting machines." This method of comprehensive utilization has been extended to other tools, such as transforming liberation-style waterwheels into well-digging and soil-lifting machines or power for animal-powered generators. "Lele carts" are now being replaced by a large number of advanced transportation tools such as automobiles, tractors, rubber-tired vehicles, and four-wheeled vehicles. The herdsmen have installed ball bearings on the four-wheeled vehicles, which has increased the carrying capacity by more than one time.
    In the herdsmen's settlements and yurts, there is another kind of scene. The first thing that catches the eye is that every household has an automatic manure unloading vehicle or a sledge. These tools have completely replaced the labor of herding women who used to clean livestock manure with their own clothes or torn hides. Some communes have already built electric milking stations in the settlements. The herdsmen of Sinihe East Sumu have also built a livestock manure biogas power station. This power station only burns 125 catties of cow dung every five hours, which is 80-90% cheaper than burning gasoline and diesel. Now the herdsmen's residences and streets are lit without oil. In the commune's factories, there are electric steel mills, electric feed crushers, electric fire saws, and other electric machinery. When the shearing season comes, people are also preparing to use electric shearing machines to shear wool. The furniture in the herdsmen's yurts has been renewed: sewing machines, small milk separators, folding tables and chairs, folding cabinets, folding wooden beds.... Dong Sinihe Commune now has more than 340 sewing machines and milk separators, with an average of one sewing machine for every two herding households and one small milk separator for every three herding households, realizing the mechanization of sewing and dairy food production.
    The vigorous development of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement has powerfully promoted the development of grassland industry and the growth of technical forces. Now, the banner has seven iron and wood factories and fifteen machinery and tool repair stations. These factories and repair stations are not only the center of technical innovation in the banner, but also the base for training technical talents. Currently, there are 145 workers working in these factories and repair stations, many of whom have become skilled in technical innovation. In addition, in the technical innovation movement, the banner has also trained nearly 50 livestock manure biogas and electric milking technicians and tractor drivers. According to Deputy Banner Head Menghe, before 1958, the herdsmen of the Evenk Autonomous Banner had to go to Hailar, which was far away, to repair tools such as grass rakes. Now, except for sand casting and electric welding, all kinds of iron and wood tools and machinery can be produced and repaired in this banner. The tools created by herdsmen of all ethnic groups have also been trial-produced and produced by these factories and repair stations. (Attached picture)

    草原盛开技术花
    ——记鄂温克族自治旗的工具改革
    本报记者　白树廉
    3月的内蒙古自治区鄂温克族自治旗草原，雪花纷飞，寒风飒飒，依然带着浓厚的数九寒天的景色。但是技术革新的花朵，争相怒放，万紫千红，捷报从各个角落，一个接着一个，雪片飞来。各族牧民用他们的丰富智慧，给呼伦贝尔大草原增添了十分春色。
    长年生活在祖国边陲草原上的鄂温克、蒙古等族牧民，正开展一个广泛而深刻的技术革新和技术革命运动。他们正迅速改变着千百年来用在生产和生活上的落后工具。在辽阔的草原上，改革工具的故事和革新技术的佳话到处流传：“西锡尼河东苏木，又创造出大头哺乳器啦，它一次可以给二十多只羔羊哺乳，比过去一人一次只哺乳一只提高效率二十多倍。”“白音托海的妇女们制成了接羔车等三、四种新工具，另外她们创造的产床成功了，就要拿到医院里进行试验。”……
    相识不久的毛敖海同志告诉我们：“可以这样说，鄂温克族自治旗的每个人，都在思考工具改革问题，只要他们感到某一种工具不适应生产和生活的要求，就去大胆地改革它、创造它，不过十天半个月，总会有一种新的或改革的工具出现……”这话一点也不夸张。我遇到了旗铁木工厂工人——我的老相识巴图孟和。他是撂下牧鞭不很久的布利雅特人。“最近在技术革新上，有什么新成就？”我问他。“已经制成一个压刀机，效率比人工高四倍。”他边说边从裤袋里掏出一张图纸告诉我：“我现在又在研究创造另一种新工具。”巴图孟和真算得起革新闯将，创造了一件又一件。我十分敬佩他的这种敢想敢干的风格。
    鄂温克族自治旗技术革新运动的规模空前巨大，绝大多数的人都卷入了这个运动。除去有经验的老工人和年青的小伙子外，就连妇女也都人人动脑筋，个个搞创造。妇女杨吉玛创造的赶毡机，一天能作一领毡子，比手工生产效率提高很多。牧女满都拉创造的风力纺毛机，提高效率二十倍。
    只要你随便在这个旗和各公社的铁木工厂里浏览一下，就可以看到数不清的集草机、垛草机、抽水机、熟皮机、造林播种机、活动畜圈、帆布水缸等大大小小、五花八门的工具模型、图纸和成品。据自治旗一位负责人说，1959年经旗里鉴定的新创造的和改革的工具，已经推广使用了一千六百件，全旗平均每六、七个人就有一种新式或改革的工具。其中水、旱路和雪地三用车、搂草机、堆草机、钻土机、双帽锯、手摇水车等十多种工具，曾运到北京和呼和浩特展览过。中共呼伦贝尔盟委员会的牧区工具改革现场会议，去年在这里召开；今年，内蒙古妇联也将在这里召开妇女技术革新现场会。
    假如你了解鄂温克族自治旗草原历史的话，就会知道：党的技术革新和技术革命的号召，在这里究竟产生了多么深远的影响。过去日伪和封建反动统治者所留给草原的遗产，就是思想闭塞和文化落后。直到1957年，这里还只是个别地区和少数牧民才有一些打草机、小型牛奶分离机、缝纫机等。绝大多数牧民用的还是落后的工具。他们每年为过冬牲畜准备饲草时，都是用镰刀一把一把地割。马匹和“勒勒车”（一种小木车）一直是这里唯一的交通运输工具，别的草原上早就广泛使用了的骆驼车，这里也只有二、三十辆，其他的生产和生活用具，也都是祖祖辈辈沿用下来的。
    现在状况完全变了。在每个广阔的牧场和定居点上，都建起了许多永久性的牲畜棚圈。在不少畜圈里，还有柳条或木板制成的槽子。三三两两的破雪器和铲雪器摆在外面，一旦天降大雪成灾，牧人们就用它们为走“敖特尔”的牲畜开辟草场，清理卧盘。过去，马拉打草机只是到了夏季打饲草时，才使用一次。现在，牧民们把它改装后，正在盛产芦苇的辉河、伊敏河畔，收割芦苇；往年牧民们用人工割苇时，一人一天只割六百斤，现在一台打草机，一天就能割一万四千多斤。到了秋季，草原上的饲料基地丰收时，牧民们还把马拉打草机改装成为谷物收割机，用来收获农作物和饲料，牧民们把这叫做“综合利用打草机”。这种综合利用的方法，已经被推广到别的工具上，如把解放式水车改造成为打井提土机或畜力发电机的动力等。“勒勒车”现在也正由大批的汽车、拖拉机、胶轮车、四轮车等先进的运输工具所代替。牧民们在四轮车上装置了滚珠轴承，使运载能力提高一倍多。
    在牧民们的定居地和蒙古包里，又是另外一种景象。首先引人注意的是，家家户户都有一个自动卸粪车或一张爬犁，这些工具完全代替了过去牧民妇女用自己衣襟或破皮张清理牲畜粪便的劳动。有的公社在定居点上已经建起了电力挤奶站。锡尼河东苏木的牧民们，还建成一座畜粪瓦斯电站。这个电站每五小时只烧一百二十五斤牛粪，比烧汽油和柴油便宜十分之八、九。现在牧民的住所和街道上，已经点灯不用油了。在公社的工厂里，出现了电力钢磨、电力饲料粉碎机、电力火锯等电力机械。到剪毛季节时，人们还准备用电力剪毛机剪羊毛呢。牧民蒙古包里的家具，焕然一新：缝纫机、小型牛奶分离机、折叠式桌椅、折叠式柜橱、折叠式木床……。东锡尼河公社现在有三百四十多台缝纫机和牛奶分离机，平均每二户牧民就有一台缝纫机，每三户牧民就有一台小型牛奶分离机，实现了缝纫、奶食生产机械化。
    群众性技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，有力地推动了草原工业的发展和技术力量的成长。现在，全旗已经有了七个铁木工厂和十五个机械工具修理站，这些厂和修配站，既是全旗技术革新的中心，又是培养技术人材的基地，目前已有一百四十五名工人，在这些工厂和修配站里工作，其中许多人已成了技术革新的能手。另外，在技术革新运动中，全旗还培养出近五十名畜粪瓦斯、电力挤奶技术员和拖拉机驾驶员。据副旗长孟和同志说，在1958年以前，鄂温克族自治旗的牧民，要修理一件打搂草机等工具，都要到遥远的海拉尔去。现在，除翻砂、电焊外，各种铁木工具和机械，都能在本旗生产和修理了。各族牧民所创造的工具，也都由这些工厂和修配站试制和生产了。（附图片）
