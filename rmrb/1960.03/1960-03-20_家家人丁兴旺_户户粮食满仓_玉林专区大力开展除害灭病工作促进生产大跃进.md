The Yulin Special District of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in its pest and disease elimination work, has achieved fruitful results by adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, strengthening organizational leadership, closely integrating with production, and vigorously launching mass movements, thereby powerfully promoting the great development of industrial and agricultural production. Starting in 1957, after less than three years of continuous struggle, it has nearly eliminated malaria throughout the entire special district and has basically relieved the threat of hookworm disease and filariasis to people's health and production. At the same time, through treating mosquito and fly breeding grounds and carrying out rat extermination and pest control, good habits of hygiene and cleanliness have been gradually cultivated among the people.

The Nine-Person Group for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a conference on the exchange of experiences in the prevention and control of hookworm disease, filariasis, and malaria in thirteen southern provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in Yulin County of this special district from the end of February to the beginning of March. The conference exchanged the experiences of this special district, and the representatives visited key counties and communes for on-site observation.

The Yulin Special District was historically known as "a land of miasma." Before liberation, the incidence of malaria in counties and townships with high rates accounted for more than 45% to 80% of the population. Hookworm disease harmed people's health and affected production even more severely. People used a ballad to describe the tragic situation in the Yulin Special District at that time: "When the late rice ripens, the miasma ghosts come, if they don't harm people, they will harm wealth; nine out of ten households are burdened, and the sick groan in their beds." After liberation, the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China led the 4.3 million people of all ethnic groups in the special district to first wage a resolute struggle against malaria. By 1959, the incidence of malaria in the entire special district had dropped from 72.6 per thousand in 1953 to 0.27 per thousand. Among the 1,875 production brigades in the special district, 1,412 brigades did not have a single malaria patient throughout the year. After the basic elimination of malaria, the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China launched a special district-wide campaign for hookworm disease survey, universal treatment, re-examination, and re-treatment in 1959. After repeated prevention and treatment, the vast majority of patients have recovered their health, greatly promoting the development of production, turning the entire special district from a "land of ghosts into a granary," last year's autumn harvest presented a new scene of "a sea of grain rolling, golden mountains shaking, and celebrations of bumper harvests everywhere in the two-hundred-mile-long granary." Last year, the county's 340,000 mu of double-cropping rice achieved an average yield of 1,309 jin per mu, exceeding the targets set by the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule by eight years. For example, more than 19,000 patients in the Songshan Commune of Rong County have been completely cured after a general survey and treatment. Last year, the commune's average yield was more than 1,600 jin per mu, and each household raised more than two pigs, and has been successively rated as an advanced production unit at the national, autonomous region, special district, and county levels. Gan Shuquan, a member of the Dazhong Brigade of the Luoyang Commune in Yulin County, recovered from hookworm disease and rejoined the labor force. He walked twenty miles to catch up with the medical team to thank them, saying, "My life was given to me by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

The main experiences of the Yulin Special District in doing a good job in pest and disease elimination work are that party organizations at all levels strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, improve organizations at all levels, designate special personnel of party committees at all levels to be responsible, and unify leadership, unified arrangements, and unified inspection. For example, in the malaria elimination campaign, emphasis was placed on "early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment." The entire special district universally established a mass grassroots epidemic reporting network composed of team leaders, scorekeepers, health workers, midwives, and local Chinese medicine practitioners. More than 41,200 anti-malaria personnel who do not leave production were trained successively, and the doctor-anti-malaria personnel area responsibility system and malaria disease card registration system were universally implemented, and once discovered, timely treatment and rapid elimination were carried out.

The pest and disease elimination work in this special district proceeds from production in every way, closely integrates with production, and vigorously launches mass movements. Party committees at all levels, according to the principle of large-scale efforts in winter and spring, concentrated efforts during festivals, and adherence to consolidation and improvement at ordinary times, implement pest and disease elimination work into various agricultural production activities and household activities. For example, treating mosquito and fly breeding grounds and vigorously promoting environmental sanitation are combined with production to accumulate fertilizer; managing manure is combined with composting to produce fertilizer, improving fertilizer efficiency, rat extermination is combined with summer harvesting to protect grain; personal hygiene and food hygiene are combined with labor competitions to prevent disease and maintain health, and improve attendance rates. In the disease elimination work, in order to minimize the delay in production for those with mild illnesses, each county has adopted methods such as "sending doctors to the door, medicine to the mouth," "doctors to the fields, medicine to the mouth," "surveying and registering in the fields during the day, taking medicine and treatment in the evening, and going to work as usual the next day." Because it proceeds from production, production and pest and disease elimination are making leaps forward simultaneously. (Yao Yange)

    玉林专区大力开展除害灭病工作促进生产大跃进
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区玉林专区在除害灭病工作中，由于坚持政治挂帅，加强组织领导，紧密结合生产，大搞群众运动，获得了丰硕成果，有力地促进了工农业生产大发展。从1957年开始，经过不到三年的连续战斗，便在全专区范围内接近消灭了虐疾，基本解除了钩虫病、丝虫病对人民健康和生产的威胁。同时，通过处理蚊、蝇孳生地和开展捕鼠灭害虫等工作，讲卫生爱清洁的良好习惯在人民中已逐步培养起来。
    中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组，2月底到3月上旬在这个专区玉林县召开了南方十三个省、市、自治区防治钩虫病、丝虫病、虐疾经验交流会议，交流了这个专区的经验，到会代表并到各重点县、公社进行了现场参观。
    玉林专区古称“瘴气之地”。在解放前，虐疾发病率高的县、乡竟占人口的45％—80％以上。钩虫病危害人民的健康，影响生产更为严重。人们用“晚稻黄熟瘴鬼来，不损人来也损财，十户人家九被累，病人床上声哀哀”的歌谣来描绘那时玉林专区的悲惨景象。解放后，中共玉林地委领导全专区四百三十万各族人民，首先与虐疾开展了坚决斗争，到1959年全专区虐疾发病率已由1953年的千分之七十二点六下降到千分之零点二七。全专区一千八百七十五个生产大队，有一千四百十二个大队全年没有发生一个虐疾病人。虐疾病基本消灭后，中共玉林地委接着在1959年又发动群众展开一个全专区规模的钩虫病普查、普治和复查、复治运动，经过反复防治，绝大多数病人已恢复了健康，大大促进了生产的发展。使全专区由“千里鬼场变粮川”，去年秋收时，到处呈现着“粮海滚、金山摇，二百里粮川到处庆丰收”的新景象。这个县去年三十四万亩双季水稻，平均亩产一千三百零九斤，提前八年超额实现了农业发展纲要所规定的指标。如容县松山公社一万九千多个患者经过普查普治已全部治愈。去年，这个公社平均亩产一千六百多斤，每户养猪两头以上，曾先后被评为全国和自治区、专区、县的生产先进单位。玉林县洛阳公社大忠大队社员甘树泉，治好钩虫病后，重新参加劳动，他走了二十里路追上医疗队感谢说：“我的命是共产党毛主席给的。”
    玉林专区搞好除害灭病工作的主要经验，是各级党组织加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，健全各级机构，指定各级党委专人负责，统一领导、统一安排、统一检查。如在消灭虐疾运动中，强调“早发现，早诊断，早治疗”。全专区普遍建立起小队长、记分员、卫生员、接生员和当地中医组成的群众基层疫情报告网。先后培训了不脱产抗虐员四万一千二百多人，并普遍推行了医生、抗虐员地区负责制和虐疾疾病卡片登记制度，一有发现，及时治疗，迅速消灭。
    这个专区的除害灭病工作，处处从生产出发，紧密结合生产，大搞群众运动。各级党委根据冬春大搞、节日突击、平时坚持巩固提高的原则，把除害灭病工作贯彻到各项农业生产活动和家务活动中去。如处理蚊蝇孳生地，大搞环境卫生，结合生产积肥；管理粪便结合沤肥制肥，提高肥效，捕鼠结合夏收保粮；个人卫生、饮食卫生结合劳动竞赛防病保健，提高出勤率。在灭病工作中，为了尽量使轻病者不耽误生产，各县都采取了“送医上门，医药到口”、“医到田头，药到口头”、“白天田头调查登记，晚上服药治疗，次日照常出工”等办法。由于从生产出发，使生产、除害灭病齐头跃进。　（姚燕戈）
