Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, March 24th: Over six hundred overseas Chinese, displaced and persecuted in Indonesia, returned to Zhanjiang Port aboard the "Da Bao Kang" ship on the 24th, receiving a warm welcome from over a thousand people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang.

　　Zhanjiang Port was filled with jubilation. Colorful flags fluttered on the docks, and huge banners reading "A strong motherland is the most powerful support for overseas Chinese" were hung on the colorful buildings. At around 8:00 AM, as the ship docked, the welcoming crowd applauded enthusiastically, shouting slogans. The returning overseas Chinese disembarked amidst the sounds of drums, music, and firecrackers. Young returning overseas Chinese excitedly sang songs like "Socialism is Good." At this time, Wang Guoqiang, Secretary of the Zhanjiang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Deputy Mayor Liu Yao, and responsible persons from the overseas Chinese affairs departments of Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces and regions who came to welcome the returning overseas Chinese stepped forward to warmly shake hands and greet the returning overseas Chinese, congratulating them on their triumphant return to the embrace of the motherland.

　　The overseas Chinese who returned this time were all from the West Java region of Indonesia, and many only carried simple luggage. Rao Guanqin, an overseas Chinese who had lived in Indonesia for more than 30 years, returned with his entire family of five, but all their luggage was just an old leather suitcase containing a few rags. The old man said, "I didn't even have the money to buy a ticket. If the motherland hadn't sent a ship to pick us up, I wouldn't have been able to return to the motherland." All the returning overseas Chinese warmly expressed to their motherland's relatives that they must actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, March 24th: People from all walks of life in Zhanjiang gathered on the evening of the 24th to welcome the more than six hundred Indonesian overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland aboard the "Da Bao Kang" ship on the morning of the 24th. Speakers at the meeting unanimously supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's reply letter to the Indonesian Foreign Minister on March 15th and hoped that the Indonesian authorities could also work together with our government in a spirit of friendly cooperation to strive to reach an agreement on the issue of repatriating overseas Chinese first, so as to continue to remove obstacles and ensure that the overseas Chinese issue is resolved fairly and reasonably as soon as possible.

　　Wang Guoqiang, Secretary of the Zhanjiang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, first spoke at the meeting, extending a warm welcome and sincere greetings to the overseas Chinese on behalf of the people of the city. He then said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's recent reply letter to the Indonesian Foreign Minister once again demonstrated our country's sincerity in resolving the overseas Chinese issue.

　　Chen Keda, the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Reception and Placement Committee for Returning Overseas Chinese, who came to Zhanjiang to welcome the overseas Chinese to participate in construction in Yunnan Province, also hoped in his speech that the Indonesian authorities would immediately stop anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities and unreasonable obstruction and harassment of overseas Chinese who want to return to China, so that the friendly relations between the two countries can be maintained and developed. Then, on behalf of the 19 million people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, he warmly welcomed the returning overseas Chinese to participate in socialist construction in Yunnan Province.

　　Liao Shilong, the representative of the returning overseas Chinese, expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of all the returning overseas Chinese for the welcome and reception from the people of the motherland. He said that returning to the warm embrace of the motherland on a ship sent by the motherland is something that we overseas Chinese could not have dreamed of for generations. The motherland's care for us overseas Chinese is truly meticulous. This kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea, and all of us overseas Chinese will never forget it. He guaranteed on behalf of the overseas Chinese that they would resolutely obey the motherland's allocation, go wherever the motherland needs them, and contribute all their strength to the great motherland.

　　After the welcoming meeting, a get-together was held.

Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, March 23rd: On the morning of the 23rd, over six hundred overseas Chinese who suffered a fire in Bangka, Indonesia, returned to the embrace of the motherland aboard the "Hai Huang" ship. Over 1,200 people from all walks of life in Shantou Port warmly welcomed and comforted their relatives returning from overseas at the dock.

　　At 11:30 AM, the returning overseas Chinese docked on four barges, and the ship and dock suddenly erupted with cheers, firecrackers, and drum music. Lin Chuan, Acting First Secretary of the Shantou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Fang Mingsheng, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Shantou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Director of the Shantou Special Zone Reception and Placement Office for Returning Overseas Chinese, Lu Jinhu, Secretary of the Shantou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor, Peng Dumin, Deputy Commissioner of the Shantou Special Administrative Office, and other party and government leaders stepped forward to express their deep condolences to the returning overseas Chinese.

　　The more than six hundred returning overseas Chinese this time are all from Bangka. One night more than a month ago, a fire suddenly broke out in this place, burning down the houses of the overseas Chinese and some of the luggage they were preparing to take back to China, leaving more than 4,000 overseas Chinese displaced. The more than six hundred overseas Chinese who returned this time only had more than 180 pieces of luggage in total. They were only wearing single clothes when they boarded the ship, and after arriving on the ship, they put on the sanitary clothes prepared by the people of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 20th: More than 700 overseas Chinese who returned aboard the "Sadana" and "Zhi Wanyi" ships returned to the motherland via Shenzhen on the morning of the 20th. In addition to more than 100 people who returned from Singapore, the others were from Indonesia.

　　At 11:30 AM, the returning overseas Chinese returned to Shenzhen via Hong Kong. Like children who had been away from their mothers for a long time, they rushed to embrace the motherland. At the bridgehead, Xu Shengzhou, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returning Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, member Li Mei, and Cai Zhongchang, standing committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, warmly stepped forward to shake hands and greet the returning overseas Chinese. Service personnel busily stepped forward to take luggage for the overseas Chinese and lead them to the rest room to rest. Lu Ying, an overseas Chinese woman who suffered from arthritis in her lower limbs and could not walk, was carried across the bridge by her husband, and then medical workers at the station immediately carried her to the station's medical room on a stretcher.

　　In the rest room, the elderly sat and rested peacefully, young students eagerly inquired about the achievements of the motherland's construction and the situation of the schools from the reception staff, and overseas Chinese women took the meals sent by the service staff and took care of their children. The enthusiastic reception from all aspects moved the returning overseas Chinese very much. They said that it felt as warm as returning home. Yang Guiying, an overseas Chinese woman who had been to Indonesia with her husband for more than 30 years, her husband had passed away, and now she was persecuted by powerful groups in Indonesia and could not live there, so she had to return with her 81-year-old mother-in-law and children. She said, today I have returned to my big family.

　　He Youdi and Liu Jiaqi, vice chairmen of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Liu Yiying, vice chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and representatives of overseas Chinese students also came to the bridgehead to welcome the returning overseas Chinese.

　　After having lunch and resting in Shenzhen, most of the returning overseas Chinese took a train to Guangzhou that afternoon.

    湛江港一片欢腾，码头上彩旗飘扬，彩楼上悬挂着“强大祖国是华侨最有力的靠山”等巨幅标语。上午八时左右，当轮船靠岸时，欢迎群众热烈地鼓掌，高呼着口号。归侨们在鼓乐喧天、鞭炮齐鸣声中登岸，归侨青年们兴奋地唱起了“社会主义好”等歌曲。这时，中共湛江市委书记王国强、副市长刘耀，以及前来迎接归侨的云南、广东、广西等省区侨务工作部门的负责人，都上前同归侨们热烈握手问好，祝贺他们胜利地回到祖国的怀抱。
    这次回国的侨胞都来自印度尼西亚西爪哇地区，许多人只携带简单的行李。在印度尼西亚侨居了三十多年的侨胞饶关秦，全家五口人都回来了，但他们的全部行李只是一只旧皮箱，里面装着几件破衣服。这位老人说：“我连买一张船票的钱也没有，要不是祖国派船去接，是无法回到祖国的。”所有归来的侨胞，都热情地向祖国亲人表示，今后一定要积极地参加祖国的社会主义建设。

    中午十一时半，归侨们经香港回到深圳，他们像久别的孩儿见了娘一样，飞快地争回祖国的怀抱。在桥头，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室副主任徐绳洲、委员李梅、中华全国归国华侨联合会常务委员蔡钟长等热情地上前和归侨们握手、问好，服务人员忙着上前为侨胞们拿行李，领归侨们到休息室休息。因下肢患关节炎不能走路的归侨芦英，由她丈夫背过桥以后，车站上的医务工作者马上接着用担架把她抬到车站医疗室。
    在休息室里，老人们安详地坐着休息，青年学生们迫不及待地向接待工作人员打听祖国建设的成就和学校的情况，归侨妇女们接过服务人员送来的饭菜照顾着孩子们吃。各方面热情的接待，使归侨们非常感动，他们说，真像回到家一样的温暖。随丈夫到印度尼西亚已经三十多年的归侨妇女杨桂英，丈夫已经去世，现在她又遭到印度尼西亚有势力集团的迫害，无法生活下去，只好带着八十一岁的婆婆和儿女回来。她说，今天我回到自己的大家庭来了。
    到桥头欢迎归侨的，还有广东省归国华侨联合会副主席何友逖、刘家琪，广州市归国华侨联合会副主席刘宜应及华侨学生的代表。
    归侨们在深圳吃过午饭和休息以后，大部分在当天下午乘火车来到广州。
