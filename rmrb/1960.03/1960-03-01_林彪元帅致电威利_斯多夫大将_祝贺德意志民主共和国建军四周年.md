Comrade General Willi Stoph, Deputy Premier and Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic,

Dear Comrade General,

On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic, I, on behalf of all the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and in my own name, extend sincere and warm congratulations to you and all German comrades-in-arms.

Under the leadership and constant care of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic has grown into a strong people's armed force. It is a loyal fighter for the German people in carrying out socialist construction and defending the fruits of victory. At the same time, together with the great Soviet Army and the armies of other socialist countries, it is vigilantly defending European security and world peace. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is sincerely pleased with the great achievements made by the fraternal National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic.

I wish the German comrades-in-arms new and brilliant achievements in defending the socialist construction cause of the people of the German Democratic Republic and in the struggle for the unification of the motherland, and in the lofty cause of defending European and world peace.

I wish the fraternal fighting friendship between the Chinese and German armies will develop and consolidate day by day!

Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China
Marshal of the People's Republic of China, Lin Biao
February 28, 1960, in Beijing
