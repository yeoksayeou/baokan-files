	Though Separated, We Are Close at Heart

	With heroic Cuba as the typical example, a great revolutionary storm is sweeping across the entire Latin America.
	Both Nixon last year and Eisenhower this year have personally experienced the onslaught of this storm. The mass demonstrations of the people against the United States are a fitting honor guard to welcome the American president.
	American imperialism is doing nothing but evil in Latin America. The American rule in Latin America is a typical example of American-style colonialism. The United States closely controls these countries economically, financially, politically, and militarily, while merely maintaining a nominal independence for them. The United States has turned Latin American countries into its source of raw materials and its market for industrial products. The American monopoly bourgeoisie desperately squeezes the lifeblood of the Latin American people. In affluent Latin America, the people are destitute everywhere. In beautiful Latin America, there are only tragic pictures everywhere. The United States has done only one main thing in Latin America, and that is plunder. Therefore, the Latin American people call American imperialism robbers, and this is fully justified.
	In 1956, we visited Latin America. To this day, the revolutionary image of the Latin American people against the United States remains deeply etched in my memory. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, an ordinary taxi driver would spit and fiercely curse "den of thieves!" when passing by the American embassy. The Latin Americans we encountered, not only workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but even capitalists, plantation owners, government officials, and cardinals, all unanimously hated the American policy of aggression. Only a small handful of comprador bourgeoisie are willing to act as American lackeys, and they are in an extremely isolated position. The American Stars and Stripes are hated in Latin America to the same degree that the Japanese Rising Sun flag and Hitler's swastika were hated during the anti-fascist war. It is clear how weak the foundation of American rule is in Latin America. Under the feet of American rule, there are volcanoes everywhere that can erupt at any time.
	Although China and Latin America are separated by vast oceans, our shared historical destiny closely links us together. "Though separated, we are close at heart" is the most accurate description. During our visit to Latin America, we lived daily in an ocean of friendship with the Latin American people. Wherever we went, upon hearing that we were Chinese, people would pat us on the back until it ached. In Santiago, at the foot of Santa Lucia Hill, an old lady pinned a yellow chrysanthemum on my lapel and said kindly: "Chrysanthemum is called 'China' in Chile. Let this flower bring the friendship of the Chilean people to China." A large entrepreneur in Brazil declared that he was definitely not a communist, but he said: "As a Brazilian, I hope that what China is today can become what Brazil will be tomorrow." He also wrote these words: "China, the mythical dreamland of my childhood. China, the land I yearn for today!" We also often heard these words: "Mao Zedong is not only yours in China, but also ours in Latin America."
	In the eyes of the Latin American people, China, like them, was once only a nominally independent semi-colonial country subjected to the cruel exploitation of imperialism. China, like them, was once a poor and backward country. But today's China has stood up and accomplished many earth-shattering things. Then, these things can also be done in Latin America. This is why the Latin American people so love the socialist New China. This is why the Latin American people so love the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong.
	We say that the sun is rising in the East and setting in the West. Latin America also belongs to this rising sun of the East. In the skies of Cuba, the sun has already risen. Throughout Latin America, the darkness has reached its end, and the sun will soon rise.
	The Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Latin American people, on the side of the Latin American people's just national democratic revolution, and join hands with the Latin American people, shoulder to shoulder, to wage a resolute struggle against our common enemy—the American imperialists. The people's cause, the just cause, is bound to triumph. The Latin American people must control the destiny of Latin America; this is a historical trend that no force in the world can stop.

    天涯若比邻

    以英雄的古巴为典型，整个拉丁美洲弥漫着大革命的风暴。
    前去年的尼克松，今年的艾森豪威尔，都亲自领略了这种风暴的袭击。人民群众的反美游行示威，这是款待美国总统的恰当的仪仗队。
    美帝国主义在拉丁美洲尽做坏事。美国在拉丁美洲的统治，是美国式的殖民主义统治的典型。美国在经济上、财政上、政治上和军事上，都严密地控制这些国家，而仅仅维持这些国家一个空头的独立名义。美国把拉丁美洲各国变成自己的原料供应地和工业品的销售市场。美国垄断资产阶级拼命榨取拉丁美洲人民的脂膏。富饶的拉丁美洲，到处民不聊生。美丽的拉丁美洲，到处都是悲惨的图画。美国在拉丁美洲只做了一件主要的事，就是掠夺。所以拉丁美洲人民把美帝国主义叫做强盗，这是有充分理由的。
    1956年，我们访问过拉丁美洲。至今，拉丁美洲人民反美的革命形象，还深深地留在我的记忆里。在巴西的里约热内卢，一个普通的出租汽车的司机，路过美国大使馆的时候，就吐一口唾沫，狠狠地骂一声“贼窝！”我们所遇到的拉丁美洲人，不但工人、农民和知识分子，甚至连资本家、庄园主、政府官员和红衣大主教，都异口同声地痛恨美国的侵略政策。甘心充当美国走狗的，只是一小撮买办资产阶级，处于极端孤立的地位。美国的星条旗，在拉丁美洲被人们痛恨的程度，就像日本的太阳旗和希特勒的卐字旗在反法西斯战争中那样地被人痛恨。可见，美国在拉丁美洲的统治基础，是何等薄弱。在美国统治的脚下，到处都是随时可以崩发的火山。
    中国同拉丁美洲虽然远隔重洋，但是，共同的历史命运，把我们紧密地联结在一起。“天涯若比邻”，这是最确切的描写。我们在拉丁美洲的访问期间，天天生活在拉丁美洲人民的友情的海洋中。无论走到哪里，一听说是中国人，人们总要把你的后背拍得发痛。在圣地亚哥市，圣露西亚山畔的一位老太太，她把一朵黄菊花缀在我的衣襟上，亲切地说：“菊花，在智利就叫‘中国’。让这朵花，把智利人民的友情带到中国吧。”在巴西的一位大企业家，他声明他绝对不是共产主义者，但是他说：“作为一个巴西人，我希望中国的今天，能够成为巴西的明天。”他还写了这样的话：“中国，我童年时代神话般的幻境。中国，我今天向往的土地！”我们还常常听到这样的话：“毛泽东，不仅是你们中国的，而且是我们拉丁美洲的。”
    在拉丁美洲人民心目中，中国，原来同他们一样，只是一个名义上独立的、受着帝国主义残酷剥削的半殖民地国家。中国，原来同他们一样，是一个贫穷落后的国家。而今天的中国，已经站立起来了，做出了许多翻天复地的大事。那末，这些事情，在拉丁美洲也都是可以做到的。这就是拉丁美洲人民为什么如此热爱社会主义新中国的缘故。这就是拉丁美洲人民为什么如此热爱中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的缘故。
    我们说，东方的太阳正在上升，西方的太阳正在没落。拉丁美洲也是属于这个正在上升的东方的太阳的。在古巴的天空中，太阳已经升起来了。在整个的拉丁美洲，黑暗已经到了尽头，太阳也快要升起来了。
    中国人民永远站在拉丁美洲人民这一边，站在拉丁美洲人民正义的民族民主革命这一边，同拉丁美洲人民手携手，肩并肩，对我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义者，进行坚决斗争。人民的事业，正义的事业，是一定胜利的。拉丁美洲人民一定要掌握拉丁美洲的命运，这是世界上任何势力都阻挡不住的历史潮流。
