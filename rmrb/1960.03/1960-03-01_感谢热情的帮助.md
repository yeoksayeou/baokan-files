    Thanks for the enthusiastic help
    Editor's Note: On February 8th, this newspaper published the "Concern for Our Common Cause" letters column on the second page. It included letters from Soviet friends Comrade Tyskin Dukvic and Comrades Zhao Guiyang and Chen Bingwen, who respectively put forward suggestions and opinions for improving the products of the Eighth Rubber Factory, Samsung Pencil Factory, and Shenyang Light Bulb Factory. Below are the replies from these enterprises.
    
    Sole Pattern Improved
    Comrade Tyskin Dukvic:
    Thank you for your valuable suggestions on the Double Ball brand sneakers produced by our factory. Since the Double Ball brand sneakers were exported abroad in 1958, we have continuously received letters of praise from Soviet friends, which has given us great encouragement. Even so, we believe that the Double Ball brand sneakers still have some shortcomings. As you mentioned in your letter, the sole pattern design is not very perfect in terms of slip resistance.
    
    Now, we have changed the calendering roller pattern of the Double Ball brand sneaker sole to a wavy line pattern. This not only overcomes the shortcomings of poor lateral slip resistance in the past, but also makes up for the defects of the straight pattern’s lack of aesthetic curves. In the near future, you will be able to see this pattern on our factory's 1960 export shoe promotional cards. We welcome you to continue to provide improvement suggestions for our factory's products.
                                  Eighth Rubber Factory
    
    Decision to Send People to Investigate the Cause
    Comrade Chen Bingwen:
    We are very grateful for your opinions on the quality of the Northeast brand 32-volt and 100-volt light bulbs produced by our factory. In order to improve product quality, we have decided to send people to the Fengtai Vehicle Depot to conduct specific understanding and analysis, find out the reasons for the poor quality, and formulate improvement measures to better meet the needs of the vast number of consumers.　Shenyang Light Bulb Factory
    
    Willing to Improve Product Quality as Soon as Possible
    Comrade Zhao Guiyang:
    Your opinion on the quality of the mapping special pencils produced by our factory is very good, which is of great help to our factory in further improving product quality. In order to conduct a specific analysis of the quality problems of this product, so as to formulate a plan to improve product quality, we hereby make two requests to you:
    
    1. Please send us one each of the different colored special pencils with quality problems that you have used. We will send you new pencils after we have improved them.
    
    2. Please indicate whether you are writing on a rubber sheet, a photographic rubber sheet, or on something else when you use the special pencils.
    
    We hope you will send us the pencils and instructions for use as soon as possible.
    
    Thank you for your help to our factory. May we work hard and move forward in different work positions.
                           　Beijing Samsung Pencil Factory

专栏：来信

    感谢热情的帮助
    编者按　二月八日本报第二版发表了“关心我们共同的事业”的来信专栏，其中刊登了苏联友人捷斯金独维契等同志和赵桂扬、陈秉文同志的信件，分别对第八橡胶厂、三星铅笔厂和沈阳灯泡厂的产品提出了改进的建议和意见。下面是这些企业的回信。
    鞋底花纹已改善捷斯金独维契同志：
    感谢您对我厂生产的双球牌球鞋提出的宝贵意见。双球牌球鞋从一九五八年远销国外以来，不断收到苏联友人的表扬信，给予我们很大的鼓舞。虽然如此，我们认为双球牌球鞋还存在着一些缺点，诚如您来信所说，鞋底的花纹设计在防滑性能方面还不是很完美的。
    现在，我们已将双球牌球鞋鞋底的压延滚筒花纹改成线波浪式，这样既克服了过去横方向防滑性能差的缺点，又弥补了直形花纹曲线不美的缺陷。不久的将来，您就可以在我厂一九六○年出口鞋的宣传卡片上看到这种式样的花纹。欢迎您不断地给我厂产品提出改进意见。
                              第八橡胶厂
    决定派人检查原因陈秉文同志：
    您对我厂生产的东北牌三十二伏和一百伏的灯泡质量提出的意见，我们非常感谢。为了提高产品质量，我们决定派人到丰台车辆段进行具体了解和分析，找出质量低劣的原因，订出改进措施，以便更好地满足广大消费者的需要。　沈阳灯泡厂
    愿尽快提高产品质量赵桂扬同志：
    您对我厂标图特种铅笔质量提出的意见很好，这对我厂进一步提高产品质量有很大的帮助。为了对该产品质量上存在的问题进行具体分析，以便制订一个提高产品质量的计划，特向您提出两点请求：
    一、请将您所使用的质量有问题的不同颜色的特种铅笔各寄一支给我厂。我们改进以后再送给您新的铅笔。
    二、请注明您在使用特种铅笔时是在胶板上，还是在照像胶板上涂写，或者是在其它东西上涂写。
    希望您尽快地把铅笔和使用说明寄给我们。
    谢谢您对我厂的帮助，愿我们在不同的工作岗位上努力前进。
                   　北京三星铅笔厂
