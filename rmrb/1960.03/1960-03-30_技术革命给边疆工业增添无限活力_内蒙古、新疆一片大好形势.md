Inner Mongolia:
Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 29th: A surging mass movement of technical innovation and technological revolution is advancing on all production and construction fronts in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On the young industrial front of Inner Mongolia, the various ethnic groups of workers and staff in over four thousand factories and mines and all basic construction sites and transportation enterprises throughout the region have put forward 716,000 technical innovation projects and rationalization proposals in January and February of this year, of which 227,000 have already been implemented. This figure far exceeds the total for the entire year of last year. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of February, 106 automatic production lines, 209 automated and semi-automated single machines, and 89 factories and mines have changed from manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized operation. 294 workshops and 755 teams have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. As a result of the technological revolution, the workers and staff on the industrial front of the autonomous region created 22.98 million yuan of wealth for the state and saved 2.79 million work hours in February alone, equivalent to the work of 11,600 people for a month. At present, the technical innovation and technological revolution movement on the industrial front of the autonomous region has entered a new stage, that is, from past single-item, single-project, and partial innovation, to the direction of continuous production and comprehensively changing manual operation to mechanization and semi-mechanization; from the innovation of one type of work, one workshop, and one enterprise, to the overall renovation of all types of work and all industries.

On the agricultural and pastoral fronts, the mass movement of technical innovation and technological revolution is also flourishing and showing great promise. At present, various localities in the autonomous region have reformed more than 142,000 agricultural tools of various kinds, of which more than 190 kinds of advanced tools for agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and water conservation are being vigorously promoted throughout the region. In Hulunbuir League, because all banners and counties and people's communes have established tool reform committees, and production teams have established agricultural tool reform groups, led by the Party committee secretaries, the entire league has reformed more than 23,400 agricultural tools of various kinds, which has strongly promoted the development of agricultural and pastoral production. After the Bayan Baolige People's Commune on the Xilin Gol grassland reformed pastoral machinery such as grass cutters and grass carts, the daily amount of grass cut increased from 30,000 jin to 210,000 jin. Ma Xibatu, a Mongolian worker from a herding family, was inspired by the clippers used by barbers in barbershops and created a hand-cranked shearing machine; with this shearing machine, a single laborer can shear the wool of 300 to 400 sheep a day, increasing work efficiency by about ten times compared to manual shearing.

The reason why the autonomous region's technical innovation and technological revolution movement can be carried out vigorously and with such significant results is due to the strong leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and vigorously promoting mass movements. Party committees at all levels regard the technical innovation and technological revolution movement as an important part of the current new stage of socialist construction. All leagues, cities, and most banners and counties have established technical innovation and technological revolution committees or leading groups, formulated work plans that are both ambitious and realistic and meticulous, so that the direction is clear and the measures are specific. They have resolutely implemented the principles of serving production, self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, moving from indigenous to foreign, moving from small to large, and vigorously promoting mass movements, so that the movement has achieved immediate results.

The recent Inner Mongolia Party Committee's conference of industrial ministers from all league and city committees called for the entire region to achieve 3 million technical innovation and technological revolution projects this year, increasing the number of workers engaged in mechanized and semi-mechanized operations from about 25% last year to about 70%; to increase labor productivity by 50% this year, so that one person can do the work of one and a half or two people, and strive to increase production in existing units without increasing personnel, and strive to save 50,000 laborers to support newly established units.

Xinjiang:

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: A technical innovation and technological revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation as its core is sweeping across the industrial and transportation sectors, basic construction sites and field exploration sites both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, creating an excellent situation on the industrial and transportation front of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

As of the beginning of March, according to incomplete statistics from industries such as metallurgy, machinery, petroleum, coal, electricity, chemicals, textiles, construction, and geology, as well as transportation departments, more than 100,500 technical innovation proposals have been put forward throughout the autonomous region, and more than 20,000 have been implemented. Some factories and mines and a large number of workshops, sections, work processes, and teams have not only achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, but have also seen the emergence of automated production lines, mechanized production linkage lines, automated oil well metering stations, and semi-automated workshops. Manual operations and heavy physical labor have been generally reduced, and labor efficiency has increased many times over, even hundreds of times over. In Urumqi, eleven factories that were originally dominated by manual operations, such as enamel, iron wire, and rubber factories, achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in less than a month, increasing the degree of mechanization from the original 35% to 51% to 70% to 80% respectively. Twenty-three automobile transportation loading and unloading yards, which were originally entirely dependent on heavy physical labor, have achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by an average of tenfold. Workers in various industries in cities famous for handicrafts such as Yining and Hotan, including leather making, silk reeling, and fur processing, are also building their own equipment and machinery on a large scale, changing manual operations to mechanized operations.

With the improvement of the degree of mechanization and the improvement of operating techniques and labor organization, the production level of a large number of factories, mines, and enterprises has begun to leap forward. After the pure alkali workshop of the Urumqi Chemical Plant realized automation of water supply, automation of alkali liquid circulation, and mechanization of mixing, the work efficiency increased by forty-four times. Workers in the petroleum industry system have increased labor productivity by an average of 11% in two months. Fertilizer production, pesticide processing, and shallow well exploration by geologists throughout the autonomous region all completed the first quarter production plan one month ahead of schedule.

In the technical innovation and technological revolution movement, all industries and units have launched fierce attacks on the weak links in production. The enamel coating workshop of the Urumqi Enamel Factory successfully trial-produced fifteen types of machines and tools, including automatic coating machines, tunnel-type automatic converters, and foot-operated cutting machines for making blanks, increasing the degree of mechanization of the entire factory from the original 25% to 74.6%, enabling the coating workshop, which was heavy in physical labor, to achieve semi-automation. The August 1st Steel Plant is currently the largest steel plant in the autonomous region and is responsible for supporting the entire Xinjiang region. However, due to incomplete equipment in the rolling mill workshop of this plant, manual operations had long been used for pulling steel and throwing steel, and the output of steel could not meet the needs of various regions. For more than a month, under the fighting slogan of "End Carrying, Pulling, and Pushing," the workshop workers and masses made a big effort in technical innovation and self-made equipment, basically realizing the tracking of red steel transportation, and most of the products of small rolling mills were produced using forward and reverse surrounding disks, saving more than sixty laborers in total. Rolling mill workers said that in the past, they were "busy with hooks and pliers, with aching backs and arms and sweating like rain," but now they are "red steel passes through the hole by itself, happily watching the fire dragon dance back and forth."

Under the guidance of the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and relying on our own efforts, workers of all ethnic groups have demonstrated the communist spirit of daring to think and act, replacing foreign methods with indigenous methods, and implementing technical innovation in a coordinated manner, adopting small methods to solve big problems. Many factories and mines have not only achieved overall mechanization or mechanization and semi-mechanization of certain departments and types of work, but have also begun to advance towards automation, semi-automation, and major sophisticated fields. Many factories and mines have built small foreign railways and indigenous railways on a large scale, and have set up foreign equipment for electric and automatic loading and unloading, as well as indigenous equipment such as indigenous cranes, chutes, and hopper foreign platforms, realizing the tracking of transportation, mechanization of loading and unloading, and Urumqi's Eight Daowan Coal Mine uses hoppers to load coal, increasing coal loading efficiency by sixty times.

Workers of all ethnic groups have also successfully trial-produced a large number of new products, including high-purity metals, large-scale mechanical equipment, automatic power load reduction devices with frequency, multi-channel carrier machines for long-distance communication, and ultrasonic flaw detectors. The emergence of these new products marks that the industrial construction and industrial production of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have begun to advance towards major sophisticated fields on the basis of learning and imitation.

    技术革命给边疆工业增添无限活力
    内蒙古、新疆一片大好形势
    内蒙古
    本报呼和浩特29日电　一个汹涌澎湃的技术革新和技术革命浪潮，正在内蒙古自治区各个生产建设战线前进着。在年轻的内蒙古工业战线上，全区四千多个厂矿和所有基本建设工地与交通运输企业的各族职工，在今年1、2月份提出技术革新项目和合理化建议达七十一万六千件，已经实现的有二十二万七千件。这个数字大大超过去年全年的总和。到2月底的不完全统计，自治区已经出现了一百零六条生产自动线、二百零九台自动化和半自动化单机、八十九个厂矿已由手工操作变为机械化和半机械化操作，二百九十四个车间和七百五十五个小组实现机械化和半机械化，由于技术革命的结果，2月份全区工业战线上的职工，就给国家多创造二千二百九十八万元的财富，节约二百七十九万个工时，相当于一万一千六百人做一个月的工作。目前，自治区工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，已进入了新的阶段，即从过去单件、单项、局部的革新，向生产连续化和全面改变手工操作为机械化、半机械化的方向发展；由一个工种、一个车间、一个企业的革新，向全工种、全行业的整体翻新发展。
    在农牧业战线上，技术革新和技术革命的群众性运动也风起云涌，方兴未艾。目前自治区各地已经改革各种农具十四万二千多件，其中农、牧、林、水等一百九十来种先进工具正在全区大力推广。呼伦贝尔盟由于各旗县和人民公社都成立了工具改革委员会、生产队成立了农具改革小组，党委书记挂帅，全盟已改革各种农具二万三千四百多件，有力地推动了农牧业生产的发展。锡林郭勒大草原上的巴彦宝利格人民公社改革了打草机、草车等牧业机具后，每天打草量由过去的三万斤提高到二十一万斤。牧民出身的蒙古族工人马希巴图在理发店里从理发师用的推子上得到了启示，创造了手摇式剪毛机；用这种剪毛机，一个劳动力一天能剪三百到四百只羊的毛，比手工剪毛提高工效十倍左右。
    自治区的技术革新和技术革命运动，所以能够开展得轰轰烈烈，效果如此显著，是由于党的坚强领导，政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。各级党委都把技术革新和技术革命运动，当作当前社会主义建设新阶段的一项重要内容。各盟、市和大部分旗县都成立了技术革新和技术革命委员会或领导小组，制定了既有雄心大志，又踏实细致切合实际的工作规划，使方向明确、措施具体。并坚决贯彻执行了为生产服务、自力更生、土洋并举、由土到洋、由小到大和大搞群众运动的方针，从而使运动收到立竿见影之效。
    最近内蒙古党委召开的各盟市委工业部长会议，要求今年全区实现三百万件技术革新和技术革命项目，使从事机械化和半机械化操作的工人，由去年25％左右提高到70％左右；今年劳动生产率提高50％，使一个人顶一个半人或两个人，力争原有单位增产不增人，并争取节约出五万个劳动力来支援新建单位。
    新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　一个以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在席卷天山南北工业交通部门、基建工地和野外勘探工地，使新疆维吾尔自治区工业交通战线出现一片大好形势。
    到3月上旬为止，根据冶金、机械、石油、煤炭、电力、化工、纺织、建筑、地质等行业和交通运输部门的不完全统计，全自治区已经提出技术革新建议十万零五千多件，已实现二万多项。一部分厂矿和大批车间、工段、工序、小组，不仅实现了机械化和半机械化，还出现了自动化生产线、机械化生产联动线、自动化油井计量站、半自动化车间等。手工操作和笨重体力劳动普遍减少，劳动效率成倍以至几百倍地增长。乌鲁木齐市原来以手工操作为主的搪瓷、铁丝、橡胶等十一个工厂，在不到一个月的时间之内，就实现了机械化和半机械化，机械化程度分别由原来的35％至51％提高到70％至80％。原来全是笨重体力劳动的汽车运输装卸场站，已经有二十三处实现了装卸机械化和半机械化，装卸效率平均提高了十倍。以手工业著名的伊宁、和田等城市的制革、缫丝、皮毛加工等各行各业的职工，也大造土设备、土机械，改手工操作为机械化操作。
    随着机械化程度的提高以及操作技术、劳动组织的改进，大批厂、矿、企业的生产水平都开始突飞猛进。乌鲁木齐市化工厂纯碱车间实现供水自动化、碱液循环自动化、拌料机械化以后，提高工效四十四倍。石油工业系统职工，在两个月中把劳动生产率平均提高了11％。全自治区的化肥生产、农药加工、地质的浅井勘探等，都提前一个月完成了第一季度生产计划。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中各行业各单位都针对生产中的薄弱环节，发起猛攻。乌鲁木齐市搪瓷厂涂烧车间试制成功自动涂搪机、隧道式自动转炉和制坯的脚踏裁剪机等十五种机具，全厂机械化程度由原来的25％提高到74．6％，使体力劳动繁重的涂烧车间实现了半自动化。八一钢铁厂是自治区目前最大的钢铁厂，负有支援全疆的任务。但是，这个厂的轧钢车间，由于设备不成套，拉钢、甩钢长期用手工操作，钢材产量不能满足各地需要。一个多月以来，在“结束抬、拉、推”的奋战口号下，车间职工群众大闹技术革新、自造设备，基本实现了红钢运输轨道化，小型轧钢机大部分产品都使用上了正反围盘生产，共节省了六十多个劳动力。轧钢工人说过去是“手拿钩钳忙不停，腰酸臂痛汗如雨”，现在是“红钢穿孔自己跑，喜看火龙来回舞”。
    在土洋结合、自力更生的方针指导下，各族职工发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，以土代洋、技术革新配套，采用小办法解决大问题。许多厂矿不但实现了全盘机械化或某些部门、工种的机械化、半机械化，而且已经开始向自动化、半自动化和重大精尖方向进军。许多厂、矿大建小洋铁路和土铁路，设立电动、自动装卸的洋设备，以及土吊车、溜槽、漏斗洋平台等土设备，实现了厂矿内土洋结合的运输轨道化、装卸机械化、乌鲁木齐八道湾煤矿用漏斗装车，装煤效率提高了六十倍。
    各族职工还试制成功了大批新产品，其中有高纯度金属，大型机械设备，电力自动随周波减负荷装置，长途通讯用的多路载波机和超声波探伤器等。这些新产品的出现，标志着新疆维吾尔自治区工业建设和工业生产在学习和仿制的基础上，已经开始了向重大精尖方向的进军。
