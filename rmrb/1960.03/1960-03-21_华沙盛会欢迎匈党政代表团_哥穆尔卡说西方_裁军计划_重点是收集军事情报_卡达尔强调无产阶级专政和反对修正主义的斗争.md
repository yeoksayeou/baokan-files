Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 19th: A grand rally was held in the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw on the evening of the 19th by people from all walks of life in Warsaw to welcome the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation. More than 3,000 people attended the mass meeting.

    Polish Party and government leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz and others attended the meeting.

    Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and Kádár, head of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, both spoke at the meeting.

    In his speech, Gomulka spoke of the great development of friendly relations between Poland and Hungary. He said that the talks with the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation showed that the two sides' assessment of the current international situation and the common task of consolidating peace was completely consistent. This visit by the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation will strengthen the friendship between us.

    Gomulka said that when the counter-revolutionary riots occurred in Hungary in 1956, the Hungarian working class and Communists received the support of the working class and the entire revolutionary movement in all socialist countries in their struggle against the counter-revolutionaries. The Hungarian counter-revolution was eliminated.

    He said that now the Hungarian working class and working people are standing on the side of socialism more firmly than ever before. He said that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party was able to mobilize the strength of the working class, lead Hungary out of difficult times, constantly strengthen its ties with the masses, and strengthen its unity with socialist countries. This is a great contribution made by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to the Hungarian people and the international workers' movement.

    Speaking of the current international situation, he said that due to the growth of the world's peace forces, especially the growth of the strength of the socialist camp, and due to the consistent peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, there has been a relaxation in international relations for a certain period of time.

    Referring to the issue of disarmament, he pointed out that there are still some influential forces in the capitalist world who are unwilling to disarm. If these forces do not place their bets entirely on war in their policies, then they are hoping that some changes favorable to the capitalist world will occur.

    Speaking of the "disarmament plan" proposed by Western countries, Gomulka said that its focus is not on disarmament, but on gathering military intelligence. Their plan makes no mention of the abolition of military bases on foreign territories, nor does it talk about banning nuclear weapons testing. Gomulka also emphasized that General Norstad, Supreme Commander of the European Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, announced, prior to the meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, the plan to establish a joint nuclear armed force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is by no means a manifestation of the desire for disarmament. There is no doubt that this plan includes arming the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons. Gomulka said, can this prove that Western countries want disarmament and want to create an atmosphere conducive to reaching a disarmament agreement?

    Gomulka said that public opinion is becoming increasingly clear that raising the issue of supervision before disarmament is actually a rejection of disarmament.

    Gomulka also pointed out that in Europe, among those forces that are unwilling to achieve disarmament, the dominant ones are West German militarists and revanchists.

    Speaking of the summit conference, Gomulka said that the whole world places hope on the upcoming meeting of heads of government and expects that the most pressing issues for the cause of peace can be concretely resolved. In addition to disarmament, the most pressing issues are, first of all, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, especially the settlement of the West Berlin issue. Gomulka said that the summit should resolve the West Berlin issue in the interests of peace. In the current situation, the best way would be to transform West Berlin into a free city. Adenauer firmly opposes this. In order to obstruct a four-power agreement, Adenauer went to the United States and vehemently opposed changing the status quo of West Berlin. Gomulka said that we hope that the summit will help to further ease international tensions and that the anti-Adenauer spirit of peace will prevail at the meeting.

    Gomulka finally emphasized the importance of developing Poland's friendship and cooperation with all socialist countries and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp.

    In his speech, Kádár spoke of the development of the Hungarian People's Republic. He emphasized that the experience of suppressing the 1956 Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion proves that without the leadership of the revolutionary party of the working class, it is impossible to maintain the power of the working class and it is impossible to build socialism. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is impossible to build socialism, and without a strong state power, it is impossible to defend one's own victorious achievements. Kádár also said that Hungary is currently engaged in a two-front struggle—against dogmatism and revisionism, with the main firepower directed against revisionism. He said that socialist democracy only gives freedom to forces that support socialism, and cannot give freedom to the enemies of socialism.

    Speaking of the international situation, Kádár expressed the hope that international tensions can continue to ease. He said that it must be pointed out that there are still anti-people "cold war" forces that are unwilling to see the easing of tensions on the international stage and are unwilling to see the principle of peaceful coexistence realized.

    He pointed out that the Hungarian government favors peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and therefore it hopes to maintain normal relations with all countries.

    Kádár condemned the "cold war" policy pursued by the West German government. He said that the policy and actions of rearming German militarism, the constant training of fascist exile groups, the gathering of former combatants under the 卐 banner, inciting revenge, and opposing the Oder-Neisse line—all of this shows that West German militarists have not abandoned their plans for aggression. Precisely because of this, although the Oder-Neisse line is geographically far from the Hungarian People's Republic, it is sacred, inviolable, and unshakable to us.

    Kádár finally spoke of the growing and consolidating political and economic ties between Hungary and Poland.

    After the mass meeting, the Hungarian Ambassador to Poland held a reception for the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation's visit to Poland.

    哥穆尔卡说西方“裁军计划”重点是收集军事情报
    卡达尔强调无产阶级专政和反对修正主义的斗争
    据新华社华沙19日电　华沙各界人民19日晚上在华沙文化科学宫举行盛大集会，欢迎匈牙利党政代表团。参加群众大会的有三千多人。
    波兰党政领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等参加了大会。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡和匈牙利党政代表团团长、匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔都在会上讲了话。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中谈到了波兰和匈牙利两国之间友好关系的巨大发展。他说，我们与匈牙利党政代表团的会谈表明，双方对目前国际形势和巩固和平的共同任务的估价是完全一致的。匈牙利党政代表团这次访问，将加强我们之间的友谊。
    哥穆尔卡说，1956年匈牙利发生反革命暴乱时，匈牙利工人阶级和共产党人在对反革命分子进行的斗争中，得到了所有社会主义国家的工人阶级和整个革命运动的支持。匈牙利的反革命被消灭了。
    他说，现在匈牙利工人阶级和劳动群众比以往任何时候都更加坚定地站在社会主义方面。他说，匈牙利社会主义工人党能够把工人阶级的力量动员起来，把匈牙利从艰苦的时期中引导出来，经常加强与群众的联系，加强与社会主义国家的团结，这是匈牙利社会主义工人党对匈牙利人民和国际工人运动作出的伟大功绩。
    他在谈到目前国际形势时说，由于世界上和平力量的增长，特别是由于社会主义阵营力量的增长，由于苏联和所有社会主义国家的始终如一的和平外交政策，从一定时期以来在国际关系中有了缓和。
    在谈到裁军问题时他指出，在资本主义世界还有一些有影响的势力不愿进行裁军。如果说这些势力在自己的政策中不是把赌注完全放在战争上，那么，他们是怀着某种希望，希望能发生某种有利于资本主义世界的变化。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到西方国家提出的“裁军计划”时说，它的重点不是裁军，而是收集军事情报。在他们的计划中，丝毫不提取消设在外国领土上的军事基地的事，也丝毫不谈禁止试验核武器的问题。哥穆尔卡还强调说，北大西洋公约组织欧洲部队总司令诺斯塔德将军在十国裁军委员会会议以前所宣布的建立北大西洋公约组织联合核武装部队的计划，绝不是希望裁军的表现。不容置疑，这一计划包括用原子武器武装西德国防军。哥穆尔卡说，难道这能够证明西方国家希望裁军、希望创造有助于达成裁军协议的气氛吗？
  哥穆尔卡说，舆论愈来愈清楚地懂得，提出在裁军之前进行监督的问题，实际上就是拒绝裁军。
    哥穆尔卡还指出，在欧洲，在那些不愿实现裁军的势力中，占主导地位的是西德军国主义者和复仇主义者。
    在谈到最高级会议时，哥穆尔卡说，全世界对即将举行的政府首脑会议寄予希望，期待对和平事业说来最迫切的问题能够得到具体解决。除了裁军外，最迫切的问题首先是缔结对德和约、特别是解决西柏林问题。哥穆尔卡说，最高级会议应该本着和平的利益解决西柏林问题，在当前情势下，最好的办法莫过于变西柏林为自由城市。阿登纳坚决反对这样做。为了阻挠四国达成协议，阿登纳前往美国，极为嚣张地反对改变西柏林的现状。哥穆尔卡说，我们希望，最高级会议将有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势，希望反阿登纳的和平精神将在会议上获胜。
    哥穆尔卡最后强调指出了发展波兰同所有社会主义国家的友好和合作、加强社会主义阵营的团结的重要性。
    卡达尔在讲话中谈到了匈牙利人民共和国的发展。他强调说，平定1956年匈牙利反革命叛乱的经验证明，没有工人阶级革命政党的领导作用，就不可能保持工人阶级的政权，就不可能建设社会主义。没有无产阶级专政就不可能建设社会主义，没有力量坚强的国家政权就不可能保卫自己的胜利果实。卡达尔还说，目前匈牙利正进行着两方面的斗争——反对教条主义和修正主义，而主要火力是反对修正主义。他说，社会主义的民主制度只给支持社会主义的力量以自由，而不能给社会主义的敌人以自由。
    卡达尔在谈到国际局势时表示希望国际紧张局势能够继续缓和。他说，必须指出，目前还存在着反人民的“冷战”力量，他们不愿国际舞台上的紧张局势缓和，不愿意和平共处原则得以实现。
    他指出，匈牙利政府赞成不同社会制度国家的和平共处，因此，它希望与所有的国家保持正常的关系。
    卡达尔谴责了西德政府执行的“冷战”政策。他说，重新武装德国军国主义的政策和行动、经常训练法西斯流亡分子集团、前参战分子在卐旗号下举行集会、煽动复仇、反对奥得—尼斯河分界线——所有这一切说明，西德军国主义者并没有放弃侵略计划。正是因为如此，尽管从地理上讲奥得—尼斯河分界线距离匈牙利人民共和国很远，但是，它对我们来说是神圣不可侵犯的和不可动摇的。
    卡达尔最后谈到了匈牙利和波兰两国之间日益发展的和巩固的政治和经济联系。
    群众大会结束后，匈牙利驻波兰大使为匈牙利党政代表团访问波兰举行了招待会。
