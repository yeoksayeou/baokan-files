Shanghai, March 13th (By our own correspondent) Under the leadership of the Yangpu District Committee, the Shanghai Yangpu District Office of the People's Bank of China, making full use of the bank's extensive connections, actively organized and promoted comprehensive collaboration between finance, banking, transportation and other departments and factory enterprises throughout the district, together with the relevant financial and industrial departments. Furthermore, this collaboration was consolidated with organizations and systems, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of production, and the bank's own tasks were victoriously overfulfilled.

Prior to organizing comprehensive collaboration, the Yangpu District Office had adopted the method of organizing collaboration between individual enterprises, assisting enterprises in solving some production difficulties. However, with the high-speed development of production, this small-scale, individual collaboration could no longer meet the needs of the comprehensive leap forward in production. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, 30% of the district's annual output value had to be completed within the last seventy-five days. In addition to mobilizing the broad masses of workers to strive for increased production, the adjustment of some raw materials or auxiliary materials and the exchange of technical operating experience all needed to be solved through extensive mutual assistance and collaboration between enterprises. Based on the investigation and reports of the banking, financial, and industrial departments, the CPC Yangpu District Committee decided to organize district-wide communist collaboration to solve these problems. Under the personal leadership of the District Committee Secretary, all factories in the district were organized into eleven collaboration groups according to industry. Representatives from industrial authorities, finance, banking, transportation and other departments participated in the collaboration groups, holding regular meetings and carrying out various collaborative activities. The content of each group's collaboration was very broad, including not only unified plans and unified steps in work, but also mutual support in manpower, materials, transportation and technology. The forms of collaboration were also diverse, including factory director collaboration meetings attended by factory directors to solve major issues requiring collaboration, and professional collaboration meetings attended by department personnel from factories' supply and marketing, production, technology departments to solve collaborative problems in these professional departments. In addition to holding regular meetings, collaboration groups sometimes held temporary meetings based on the special needs of factories to solve urgent collaboration problems. Some problems were also addressed through on-site visits, going deep into factories to conduct on-the-spot research and solve problems on the spot.

Since Yangpu District launched comprehensive collaboration in various forms, it has achieved significant economic and political results in the past six months. As of late February, the collaboration groups throughout the district had solved 958 key production problems, the vast majority of which were mutual collaboration and mutual support among enterprises in terms of surplus raw materials, materials, tools, technology, and labor. Banking and financial departments also provided factories with much assistance in the supply of funds, and transportation departments assisted in the coordination of transport capacity. Through collaboration, thirty enterprises that originally had difficulty completing the state plan last year generally completed the annual state plan two to six days ahead of schedule. Twenty-one key products that were originally difficult to "pass the test" were also completed on schedule and in the required quality. This comprehensive collaboration effectively played a role in supplementing and balancing the state plan, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of production. Not only that, but the cadres and workers of many enterprises have established collectivist thinking in the comprehensive collaboration, and the communist style has been greatly developed. Many enterprises unreservedly disclosed surplus equipment and materials to support factories in difficulty; some workers voluntarily gave up their vacations to work overtime for fraternal factories. A new atmosphere of mutual assistance, mutual support, and common collaboration is evident everywhere.

In the district-wide comprehensive collaboration, the bank office made full use of the characteristics of a comprehensive department to effectively play the role of a "General Staff Headquarters". They adopted the following methods:

(1) Connecting top and bottom, communicating left and right. The District People's Bank and the Finance Bureau regularly studied the District Committee's instructions, implemented the District Committee's instructions and intentions into the collaboration groups, and promptly reflected the problems in the collaboration to the District Committee for reference in guiding the activities of the collaboration groups. The banking department also regularly compiled and printed the activities and experiences of each collaboration group, as well as the vivid examples of mutual collaboration among enterprises, for exchange and dissemination, so that the content of collaboration activities in each group would continue to be enriched and improved.

(2) Focusing on the central task of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan, grasping the key points, breaking through weak links, and striving for "all-round red" production in all enterprises in the district. Under the resounding slogan of "Not letting a single factory fall behind" put forward by the District Committee, cadres from the banking, finance, and industrial departments divided their work and collaborated, using their main strength to assist factories with difficulty in completing the state plan to "pass the test." They promptly reported the production situation of these enterprises to the collaboration group leaders, mobilizing all forces to organize collaboration, so that when one family had difficulties, everyone helped.

(3) Doing everything possible to help enterprises solve problems that were not solved or could not be solved at the collaboration group meetings. Since these collaboration groups were organized by industry, most problems could be solved within the group, but sometimes it was not possible to solve them completely by relying solely on group collaboration. The banking department used the advantageous conditions of its extensive connections to organize cross-group or cross-regional collaboration. For example, Yangpu Cotton Mill needed 800 kilograms of waste blue lead in the technical innovation movement, which was not resolved at the textile industry collaboration group meeting. The bank credit officer brought this requirement to the electrical machinery group collaboration meeting, and obtained the support of Shanghai Cable Factory, solving the key production problem of Yangpu Cotton Mill. In addition, before each collaboration meeting, cadres from the banking and financial departments collected and sorted out the data for the meeting in advance, helping the collaboration group leaders to determine the meeting's focus; after the meeting, they assisted the group leaders in checking the implementation of resolutions, prompting the rapid realization of collaborative matters.

Due to the organization of comprehensive collaboration in Yangpu District, the high-speed development of production was promoted, and the district's financial revenue also increased significantly. The turnover of enterprises' working capital was greatly accelerated. In the fourth quarter of last year, the district's industrial profits increased by 32% compared with the third quarter, and tax revenue increased by 26%. In January and February of this year, financial tax revenue continued to increase; the working capital turnover rate accelerated by 22.2%, and credit funds decreased by 3.4%; with the great leap forward in production, banking and financial work has seen an unprecedented leap forward.

    联系上下沟通左右　把财政、金融、交通部门和工厂拧成一股绳
    上海杨浦区银行组织生产大协作
    促进了工业生产高速度发展　银行工作空前跃进
    本报上海13日电　中国人民银行上海市杨浦区办事处在区委的领导下，充分运用银行部门联系面广的特点，会同财政、工业等有关部门，积极组织、推动全区财政、金融、交通等部门和工厂企业之间进行全面大协作，并且把这种协作用组织和制度巩固下来，有力地推动了生产的高速度发展，银行本身的任务也胜利地超额完成。
    在组织全面协作以前，杨浦区办事处曾经采取组织个别企业之间协作的办法，协助企业解决了生产上的一些困难。但是随着生产的高速度发展，这种小规模的个别协作，已经不能适应生产全面跃进的需要。例如去年第四季度，这个区全年产值的30％要在最后的七十五天内完成，除去发动广大职工努力增产外，有些原材料或辅助材料的调剂、技术操作经验的交流，都需要通过企业之间广泛的互助协作来求得解决。中共杨浦区委根据银行、财政和工业部门的调查、汇报，决定组织全区的共产主义大协作来解决这些问题。在区委书记亲自领导下，把全区所有的工厂按行业组成了十一个协作小组，工业主管部门、财政、银行、交通运输等部门都派人参加到协作小组中来，定期召开会议，展开各种协作活动。各小组协作的内容很广泛，不但有工作上的统一计划、统一步调，而且有人力、物力、运输和技术上的互相支援。协作的形式也是多种多样，有各厂厂长参加的厂长协作会议，解决需要协作的主要问题；也有各厂科室人员参加的供销、生产、技术等专业协作会议，解决这些专业部门的协作问题。协作小组除定期召开会议以外，根据工厂的特殊需要，有时还举行临时会议，解决急需协作的问题。有些问题还采取现场参观的方式，深入工厂就地研究，就地解决。
    杨浦区运用多种多样形式开展全面大协作以后，半年来收到显著的经济效果和政治效果。截至2月下旬，全区各协作小组共解决了九百五十八项生产上的关键问题，其中绝大部分是各企业之间在多余的原料、材料、工具、技术、劳动力等方面的相互协作、相互支援。银行、财政部门在资金的供应、交通运输部门在运力的调剂等方面也给予工厂很多帮助。通过协作，使去年年底原来完成国家计划有困难的三十个企业，一般都提前两天到六天完成了全年国家计划。原来不易“过关”的二十一项重点产品，也都按质按量地完成了任务。这种全面大协作实际上发挥了对国家计划补充平衡的作用，有力地促进了生产的高速度发展。不仅这样，许多企业的干部和职工在大协作中树立了集体主义思想，共产主义风格大大发扬。许多企业毫无保留地公开多余设备和材料，支援有困难的工厂；有的职工自愿放弃休假，为兄弟厂加班生产。你帮我、我帮你，相互支援，共同协作的新风气到处可见。
    在全区性的大协作中，银行办事处充分运用综合部门的特点，有效地发挥了“参谋部”的作用。他们采取了以下几种做法：
    （一）联系上下，沟通左右。区人民银行和财政局经常研究区委指示，把区委指示和意图贯彻到协作小组中去，又把协作中的问题及时向区委反映，供区委指导协作小组活动的参考。银行部门还经常把各个协作小组活动的情况和经验以及各企业相互协作的生动事例，编印成册，进行交流传播，使各组协作活动的内容不断丰富提高。
    （二）围绕全面完成国家计划的中心任务，抓住重点，突破薄弱环节，力争全区各企业生产“满堂红”。在区委提出的“不让一个工厂掉队”的响亮口号下，银行、财政和工业部门的干部分工协作，以主要力量协助完成国家计划有困难的工厂“过关”，他们及时把这些企业的生产情况向协作小组长反映，调动各方面的力量组织协作，做到一家困难，大家帮助。
      （三）千方百计帮助企业解决协作小组会上没有解决或不能解决的问题。由于这些协作小组是按行业组织的，多数问题可以在本小组获得解决，但有时单靠组内协作还不可能完全解决，银行部门就利用联系面广的有利条件，组织跨组协作或跨区协作。如杨浦棉纺厂在技术革新运动中需要八百公斤废青铅，在纺织业协作小组会上没有获得解决，银行信贷员把这个要求带到电机小组协作会上，取得了上海电缆厂的支援，解决了杨浦棉纺厂生产上的关键问题。此外，在每次协作会议以前，银行、财政部门的干部事先都为会议搜集和整理了资料，帮助协作小组长确定会议中心；会议又协助大组长检查决议执行情况，促使协作事项尽快地实现。
    杨浦区由于组织全面大协作，促进了生产的高速度发展，全区财政收入也随之显著增加，企业流动资金的周转大大加快。去年第四季度全区工业利润比三季度增加32％，税收增加26％，今年1、2月份财政税收继续增加；流动资金周转率加速22．2％，信贷资金下降3．4％；银行、财政工作随着生产的大跃进，出现了从来未有的跃进局面。
