Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 4th: Indian newspapers have protested the notorious former Socialist Party leader Narayan's U.S.-backed plan to convene an so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" here in April to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    The most recent issue of the weekly "People's Age," in a lengthy editorial, revealed that the purpose of this conference is to "incite the people of Asia and Africa by spreading deceptive propaganda against China and to interfere in China's internal affairs."

    It said, "The people who manufacture these lies are receiving the full support of the imperialists, especially the Americans. These people, under the protection of the Americans, are undermining relations between India and China, two neighboring countries. The conference organized by Narayan is a conspiracy of these anti-people groups and traitors." The newspaper called on the democratic and progressive forces in India to "expose this reactionary group" and "mobilize the people to oppose their conspiracy."

    The most recent issue of the weekly "Link" said, "Although its guardian Narayan says he wants to gather government delegations from various countries to participate in this performance, he can only find a motley crew of minor figures from the lounges of the Central Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." It said, "Money doesn't seem to be a big problem; what the organizers find difficult is the lack of popular response."

    According to the "Indian Express," the planned so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from April 8th to 10th.

    印度报刊抗议所谓“亚非西藏会议”
    谴责纳拉扬的反华新阴谋
    新华社新德里4日电　印度报刊对臭名远扬的前社会党领袖纳拉扬在美国支持下于4月间在这里召开干涉中国内政的所谓“亚非西藏会议”表示抗议。
    最近一期的“人民世纪”周刊在长篇的社论中揭露说，这个会议的目的是要“以散布反对中国的欺骗宣传来煽动亚非人民，干涉中国的内政”。
    它说，“制造这些谎言的人是得到帝国主义者，特别是美国人的完全支持的。这些人在美国人的保护之下破坏印度和中国这样两个邻国之间的关系。纳拉扬搞的这个会议就是这些反人民的集团和叛徒的一个阴谋”。这家报纸号召印度的民主进步力量“揭露这一反动集团”，并“鼓动人民起来反对他们的阴谋”。
    最近一期的“联系”周刊说，“尽管守护神纳拉扬说他要纠集各国的政府代表团来参加这次演出，但是他只能从中央条约组织和东南亚条约组织的休息室里找到一批杂牌小人物”。它说，“金钱看来不成什么大问题，使组织者感到为难的是缺乏大众的响应”。
    据“印度快报”报道，策划中的所谓“亚非西藏会议”打算在4月8日到10日在新德里召开。
