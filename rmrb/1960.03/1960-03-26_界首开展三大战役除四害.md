Jieshou Launches Three Major Campaigns to Eliminate the Four Pests

(Our dispatch) The Jieshou County in Anhui Province convened a “Great Leap Forward in Health Work Conference” as early as the end of last year. More than 200 people attended, including the Party secretaries of each township and brigade, the heads of the township commune hospitals, the heads of the brigade medical and health stations, and representatives of relevant units. The meeting conveyed and implemented the Jishan Conference spirit and clarified the tasks for the future. The meeting also decided to launch three major campaigns in disease prevention through pest elimination in the coming winter and spring: the first campaign would focus on eliminating residual four pests and cleaning up breeding grounds; the second campaign would vigorously promote basic sanitation construction; the third campaign would continue to clean up residual eight pests and their breeding grounds, as well as continue to vigorously promote the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases.

At present, the first campaign, centered on eliminating residual eight pests and cleaning up their breeding grounds, is being carried out vigorously throughout the county. The number of people participating in the movement every day is as high as about 300,000, accounting for 82% of the county's total population. Since December of last year, more than 600 ditches and ponds have been repaired, more than 1,000 depressions have been filled, and more than 170,000 loads of garbage have been removed, eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Everywhere has become clean and hygienic, and mosquitoes and flies have nowhere to hide. Investigation and research work on mosquito and fly breeding grounds and living habits have continued. At present, 316 model health and disease-free production teams have emerged. Due to the great attention paid to sanitation at water conservancy construction sites, 12 disease-free camps have emerged at the county's river network chemical engineering sites. All villages have established "health and healthcare rooms." (Attached picture)

    界首开展三大战役除四害
    本报讯　安徽省界首县早在去年年底就召开了各乡、大队党委书记、各乡公社医院院长、大队医疗保健站站长和有关单位代表共二百多人参加的“卫生工作跃进大会”，传达和贯彻稷山会议精神，明确了今后的任务。会议并决定去冬今春在除害灭病工作上开展三个大战役：第一个战役以消灭残余四害为主，清除四害孳生场所；第二个战役大搞卫生基本建设工作；第三个战役继续作好消灭残余八害及其孳生场所的扫尾工作和继续大搞防治地方病工作。
    目前以消灭残余八害清除八害孳生场所为中心的第一战役，正在全县范围内轰轰烈烈地开展。每天参加运动的人数，多达三十万人左右，占全县总人口的82％。从去年12月以来，已经重新修整了沟塘六百多条，填平洼地一千多处，扫除垃圾十七万多担，清除了蚊蝇孳生场所，到处变得整洁卫生，蚊蝇无藏身之地，并继续进行了对蚊蝇孳生场所和生活活动习性的调查研究工作。目前已经出现了三百十六个卫生模范无病生产队。由于大抓了水利工地卫生，全县河网化工地已出现十二个无病营。所有村庄都建立了“卫生保健室”。（附图片）
