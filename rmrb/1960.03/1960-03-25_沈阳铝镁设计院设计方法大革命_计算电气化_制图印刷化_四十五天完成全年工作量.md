According to the Liaoning Daily, the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute is undergoing a surging design work revolution. This revolution has fundamentally changed the design work methods. Various analog resistance computers have electrified the tedious and massive calculation work; drafting has achieved typesetting assembly and printing, liberating designers and draftsmen who were constantly hunched over drawing boards. The design speed has been greatly accelerated.

Like other design institutes, the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute has always followed the old working methods: determining the plan, calculating, drafting, blueprinting, etc. Designing the drawings for a medium-sized aluminum plant required hundreds of people working at desks for hundreds of days.

This design work revolution had been brewing and growing since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the entire institute launched a vigorous technical performance competition. Designers offered their unique skills and tackled key problems. A series of innovations emerged, such as data manualization, calculation charting, drawing versatility, and design coordination, which greatly improved design efficiency. However, the calculation and drafting processes could not keep up. In October of last year, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to break superstitions, dare to think and act, march towards mechanization, automation, electrification, factoryization, and vigorously develop radio, pointing out the direction for fundamentally revolutionizing design work.

This design work revolution is prominently manifested in the electrification of calculations. From the Spring Festival holiday this year, the institute has seen a high tide of vigorous electrification. The architectural design research office, which did not understand electricity, fired the first shot. Engineer Yang Youyi and a dozen others in this office gave up their rest during the Spring Festival and worked hard for five consecutive days and nights to create the institute's first analog resistance computer – the "Five-Span Continuous Beam Computer." This computer improves efficiency by twenty to fifty times compared to the previous manual and mental calculation methods. The Party committee gave timely and enthusiastic encouragement and support, and the movement progressed rapidly and unusually. It quickly expanded from the architectural office to the power office, process office, technical and economic office, and other design research offices, and even service departments. From a dozen people, it expanded to all staff in each office, and everyone started working on electrification. In just over twenty days, forty-three analog resistance computers for various purposes, such as equipment selection, material balance, multi-story frames, ventilation networks, earthwork, material analysis, and thermal pipe span, were produced, basically replacing this part of mental labor in design calculation work with electrification. The calculation speed has increased by five to one hundred times, and generally by fifty to sixty times. For example, in the past, when the technical and economic office calculated the materials and labor required for a general building, the calculators had to pull the slide rule and crank the computer dozens of times, taking four to six hours to complete. Now, with the material analysis computer, it only takes a few minutes to calculate the required labor and fifteen kinds of building materials such as brick, sand, stone, wood, and steel.

Another feature marking the revolution in design work is the typesetting and printing of drawings. In February of this year, after the electrification of calculations, drafting fell far behind the work needs. Relevant personnel devised a method to classify and match the drawings of various units and components. During the design process, they only needed to select and assemble them like a Chinese medicine store grabbing medicine, and then they could be printed into new drawings. This liberates the manual labor of drafting and drawing, allowing them to only assemble designs and create new design typefaces, and then print them.

The electrification of calculations and the typesetting of drawings create the prerequisites for the factoryization of design. This highly complex mental labor can be changed from individual labor to collective labor, and the organization and management can also be changed from contracting a certain project design to segmented operations like a factory. This change is only just beginning at the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute, but it has already shown its advantages. Realizing the electrification of calculations, the typesetting of drawings, and the factoryization of design makes it possible to develop towards automated assembly lines. Currently, architectural, power, process, general layout, and other design research offices have already connected the calculation electrification with the drawing typesetting assembly and printing and other innovations to form a design work linked operation line and reformed the organizational division of labor. The newly formed engineering group, calculation station, assembly group, publishing group, and other complete sets of labor organizations have replaced the old organizational forms and abolished the many repetitive work procedures of the past.

The electrification and preliminary factoryization of design work have rapidly improved work efficiency and comprehensively realized the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical design work. For example, to complete the preliminary design and construction drawing tasks of a medium-sized aluminum plant, it took seven months in 1959, a month at the beginning of this year, and now it only takes fifteen days to complete. The institute has completed the workload for the entire year in forty-five days, and all design quality is first-class.

The realization of the design work revolution in this institute has not only greatly improved work efficiency but also liberated a large number of personnel, allowing them to strengthen scientific research work. The number of people in the institute participating in scientific research only accounted for 20% of the total number of people in the institute in December last year, but it has now increased to 40%. Since the beginning of this year, they have completed eighteen scientific research projects. In addition, more than eighty technicians have been sent to form technical transformation service teams to assist factories and mines in technical transformation.

Currently, the designers of this institute are using their wisdom and hands to continue to strive for the further electrification and automation of design work. (Attached picture)

As long as an ordinary designer presses the button to operate, it takes only two hours to complete the amount of work that a senior designer could only complete in two weeks.

    沈阳铝镁设计院设计方法大革命
    计算电气化　制图印刷化　四十五天完成全年工作量
    据辽宁日报报道　沈阳铝镁设计研究院正在进行一场汹涌澎湃的设计工作大革命。这次革命，使设计工作方法起了根本变化。各种模拟式电阻计算机，已经使繁琐的大量的计算工作实现了电气化；制图实现了活版装配和印刷化，解放了常年伏身于图板上的设计人员和描图人员。设计速度大大加快。
    沈阳铝镁设计研究院和其它设计院一样，过去一直沿用旧的工作方法：确定方案、计算、描图、晒图等等，设计一个中型制铝工厂的图纸，需要几百个人伏在桌子上劳动几百天。
    这次的设计工作大革命，从1958年大跃进的时候起，就已经在孕育、成长。党的八届八中全会以后，全院展开了轰轰烈烈的技术表演赛，设计人员纷纷献绝招，攻关键，相继出现了资料手册化、计算图表化、图纸万能化以及设计配套等一系列的革新，使设计工作效率大大提高。但是，计算、描图两个工序跟不上。去年10月，中共辽宁省委发出了破除迷信，敢想敢干，向机械化、自动化、电气化、工厂化进军和大办无线电的号召，给他们指出了设计工作从根本上进行革命的方向。
    这次设计工作大革命，突出地表现在计算电气化上。从今年春节假日开始，这个院便出现了大搞电气化的高潮。不懂电气的建筑设计研究室打响了第一炮。这个室的工程师杨友义等十几个人，在春节放弃了休息，连续五昼夜刻苦钻研，制成了全院第一台模拟式电阻计算机——“五跨连续梁计算机”。这台计算机比过去的手工和脑力计算的方法，提高效率二十到五十倍。党委及时地给予热情的鼓励和支持，运动进展迅猛异常，很快就由建筑室扩展到动力室、工艺室、技术经济室等各个设计研究室、以至服务部门，由十几个人扩展到各室全体人员，人人动手大搞电气化。二十几天的工夫，就制成了设备选择、物料平衡、多层框架、通风网路、土方、工料分析、热工管道跨距等各种用途的模拟式电阻计算机四十三台，使设计计算工作这部分脑力劳动，基本上为电气化所代替。计算速度分别提高了五倍到一百倍，一般的都提高五、六十倍。如技术经济室过去计算一项一般的建筑所需的材料和人工，计算人员要几十次地拉计算尺、摇计算机，四到六小时才能算完。现在有了工料分析电算台，几分钟就把所需的人工和砖、砂、石、木材、钢材等十五种建筑材料计算出来。
    标志着设计工作大革命的又一特点是制图活版化和印刷化。今年2月，计算电气化以后，描图远远跟不上工作需要。有关人员便设法把各种机组、构件的图纸配套分类，设计时只要像中药铺抓药那样选择装配起来，就可以晒印成新图。这样便解除了制图和描图的手工劳动，只作设计装配和制作新设计的活版，然后印刷出来就可以了。
    计算电气化和制图活版化为设计工厂化创造了前提条件。这种高度复杂的脑力劳动可能从个体劳动改变为集体劳动，组织管理也可以由某项工程设计一包到底改变为像工厂那样分段作业。这种变化在沈阳铝镁设计院还仅仅是开始，但已显示出它的优越性。实现计算电气化、制图活版化、设计工厂化，也就可能向自动化作业线发展。现在，建筑、动力、工艺、总图等设计研究室，已经在计算电气化的基础上同图纸活版装配化、印刷化等革新连接组成了设计工作联动作业线，并且改革了组织分工。新组成的工程组、计算站、装配组、出版组等一整套的劳动组织，代替了旧的组织形式，废除了过去往返重复的许许多多工作程序。
    设计工作的电气化和初步的工厂化，使工作效率飞速提高，全面地实现了设计工作的多、快、好、省。如以完成一座中型铝厂的初步设计和施工图任务为例，1959年要七个月时间，今年年初需要一个月，现在只要十五天就可以完成了。这个院今年全年的工作量，四十五天就完成了，设计质量全部是甲级品。
    这个院实现设计工作大革命，不仅大幅度地提高了工作效率，还解放出大批人力，得以加强科学研究工作。全院参加科学研究的人员，去年12月只占全院人数的20％，现在已经增加到40％。今年以来，他们已经完成了十八项科学研究项目。此外，还派出八十余名技术人员组成技术改造服务队，分赴厂矿协助进行技术改造。
    现在，这个院的设计人员正用自己的智慧和双手，为设计工作的进一步电气化、自动化继续奋斗。（附图片）
