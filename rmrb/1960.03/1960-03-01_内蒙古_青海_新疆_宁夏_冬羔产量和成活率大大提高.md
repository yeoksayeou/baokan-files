Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia
Winter Lamb Production and Survival Rate Greatly Increased

    (Our report) As of mid-February, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has produced more than 2,449,000 winter lambs, including more than 323,000 improved lambs. Judging from the current situation of winter lambing and conservation, the number of lambs received and the survival rate of young lambs have greatly increased compared with previous years. The number of winter lambs received in the region has increased nearly five times compared with the total number of winter lambs in 1959.
    In order to achieve "one hundred lambs per one hundred ewes," all localities have adhered to putting politics in command in the work of receiving winter lambs, with leading cadres taking responsibility for specific areas, launching mass movements in a big way, and solving problems on the spot. Various banners and counties have held various meetings to further study the problems existing in the work of lambing and conservation. Many banners (counties) are led by the Party Secretary, organizing a large number of people to conduct "seven checks" (check wintering and spring preparations, check livestock fatness, check sheds, check feed, check lambing and conservation, check mating, check utilization); some areas actively rectify the pastoral teams and do a good job in the political and ideological education of breeders and herdsmen.
    Because all localities have given full play to the enormous superiority of the people's communes, the preparations for wintering and spring for livestock are relatively adequate.

    (Our report) At present, Qinghai Province has produced more than 1,540,000 winter lambs, with a survival rate of more than 94%. The weight of lambs has also greatly increased compared with previous years. Many communes have seen newborn lambs weighing more than ten catties.
    When the season for ewes to lamb came, all people's communes in Qinghai took lambing and rearing as the overriding central task, adding lambing personnel to each ewe flock, sewing a large number of lambing bags, building many warm lambing sheds and warm kang, universally selecting good pastures for lambing ewes, supplementing feed, and also equipping lambs with dairy cows and preparing preventive medicines. Because the ewes are in good physical condition and the lambing preparations are thorough, the lambs born are strong and have a high survival rate.
    All localities have generally carried out artificial estrus and hot mating for the appropriate-aged and healthy ewes that have already lambed. Many production teams with the conditions have basically achieved one production, one estrus, and one hot mating. These ewes will break the "conventional" practice of producing only one litter a year and will produce another litter in the summer of this year. All communes have registered and established files for ewes with multiple lambs and the lambs they produce, and are prepared to select and transfer a group of multi-lamb livestock.

    (Our report) The vast pastoral areas and rural areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have basically completed the early spring lambing of ewes. According to incomplete statistics, the winter lambs and early spring lambs that have been received by farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains number more than 1.2 million, an increase of more than 40% over the same period last year, and the lamb survival rate in various places is as high as 97%.
    The outstanding characteristics of small livestock breeding in the autonomous region this year are the large number, good quality, and high reproduction rate of winter lambs and early spring lambs. The ewes lambing in winter and early spring in various places account for about one-third of the autonomous region's more than seven million appropriate-aged ewes, and more than 80% of the lambs born are improved lambs of the famous Xinjiang sheep and Kuqa lambskin sheep, and Fuhai large-tailed sheep.
    After communization, livestock production has implemented large-scale collective management, and has universally established commune-run pastures, brigade-run pastures, and professional teams, and has trained more than 100,000 people in short-term courses in grazing, feeding, lambing, epidemic prevention, etc., which has greatly improved the level of feeding management. In particular, the Party committees at all levels have taken the lead in grasping the lambing preparation work, so although a large number of ewes lambed in the cold season this year, the people's communes in various places have made arrangements for many sheds and warm circles, and abundant forage, making the ewes strong and the lambs fat.

    (Our report) Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has a bumper harvest of lambs. According to incomplete statistics, among the 1,080,000 appropriate-aged ewes and goats in the region, more than half of the ewes have produced more than 600,000 lambs, with a survival rate generally above 95%.
    The communes and production teams in the Ningxia area have made a series of preparations for the sheep to overwinter, so the sheep are very healthy during the wintering period. In order to strengthen the grazing management work, in addition to generally reducing the size of the herds in the summer and autumn of last year, the region has also stored more than 300 million catties of wild grass, averaging 150 catties of grass per sheep. According to incomplete statistics, various places have allocated more than 1,510,000 mu of winter and spring pastures and built 7,200 sheds, circles, and cave dwellings.
    As soon as the work of receiving, protecting, and rearing lambs began, the communes allocated a group of laborers to support livestock production. In Yanchi and Tongxin counties alone, more than 6,000 people participated in this work. The relevant departments also organized inspection teams to go deep into the sheep pens to conduct evaluations and inspections, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of lambers and herders. Due to the good feeding management of ewes last year, the ewes are strong, and the lambs born are also mostly strong, lively, and have bright fur.

    内蒙古　青海　新疆　宁夏
    冬羔产量和成活率大大提高
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区截至2月中旬，已产冬羔二百四十四万九千多只，其中改良羔三十二万三千多只。从当前冬羔接产保育情况来看，接羔数量和幼羔成活率比往年大大提高，全区已经接下的冬羔数量比1959年度全部冬羔数增加近五倍。
    为了实现“百母百仔”，各地在接冬羔工作中，坚持了政治挂帅，主要负责干部分片包干、大搞群众运动，发现问题就地解决。各旗县都分别召开了各种会议，进一步研究了接羔保育工作中存在的问题。许多旗（县）由书记挂帅，组织大批人员进行“七查”（查过冬过春准备、查畜膘、查棚圈、查草料、查接羔保育、查配种、查使役）；有些地区积极整顿牧业队伍，做好饲养员和牧工的政治思想教育工作。
    各地由于充分发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，牲畜的过冬过春物资准备都较充分。
    本报讯　目前，青海省已经生产冬羔一百五十四万多只，成活率达到94％以上。羔羊体重也比往年大为增加，好些公社出现了重在十斤以上的初生羔。
    进入母羊产羔季节时，青海各人民公社都以接羔育幼为压倒一切的中心任务，给每个母羊群增添了接羔人员，缝制了大批接羔袋，修建了许多产羔暖棚和暖炕，普遍给产羔母羊选留了好草场，进行了补饲，还为羊羔配备了奶牛，制好了防疫药剂。因为母羊体质好，接羔准备工作周全，所以生下的羊羔体格健壮，成活率很高。
    各地对已产的适龄健壮母羊，普遍进行了人工催情和热胎配种，许多有条件的生产队基本上做到生产一只，催情一只，热配一只。这些母羊都将打破一年只产一胎的“常规”，在今年夏季又将产羔一次。各公社对一胎多羔的母羊和所产的羔羊，都进行了登记，建立档案，准备选调一批一胎多仔的母畜。
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区广大牧区和农村，母羊早春产羔已基本结束。天山南北各族农牧民已接产的冬羔和早春羔，据不完全统计，有一百二十多万只，比去年同期增加40％以上，各地羔羊成活率高达97％。
    今年自治区小畜繁育的突出特点，是冬羔和早春羔数量多、质量好、繁殖率高。各地在冬季和早春产羔的母羊，约占自治区七百多万只适龄母羊的三分之一左右，所生的羔羊80％以上是著名的新疆羊和库车羔皮羊、福海大尾羊的改良羔羊。
    公社化后，畜牧业生产实行了较大规模的集体经营，普遍建立了社办牧场，大队办牧场和专业队，短期训练了十万多名放牧、饲养、接羔、防疫等人员，大大提高了饲养管理水平。特别是各级党委挂帅狠抓了接羔准备工作，因而今年虽有大批母羊在严寒季节产羔，但各地人民公社都作到了棚多圈暖、草料丰足、母壮儿肥。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区羊羔丰收。据不完全统计，全区现有的一百零八万只适令母绵羊和母山羊中，有半数以上的母羊已产羔六十多万只，成活率一般都在95％以上。
    宁夏地区各公社、生产队为羊只过冬进行了一系列准备工作，因而羊只在越冬期间，都很健壮。为了加强放牧管理工作，除去年夏秋两季普遍划小了畜群外，全区还打贮野草三亿多斤，平均使每只羊有草一百五十斤。据不完全统计，各地共划留冬春草场一百五十一万多亩，搭棚、修圈、挖窑洞七千二百多间。
    接羔、保羔、育羔工作刚开始，各公社就调配了一批劳力，支援畜牧业生产，仅盐池、同心两县参加这一工作的就有六千多人。各有关部门还组织了检查小组，深入羊圈进行评比检查，从而更加鼓舞了接羔员和放牧员的积极性。由于去年母羊饲养管理的好，母羊体壮，所生下的羊羔也大都健壮、活泼、毛色光亮。
