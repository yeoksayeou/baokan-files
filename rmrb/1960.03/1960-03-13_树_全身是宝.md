Trees are useful from head to toe. Besides the trunk which can be used for various constructions, vehicles, ships and furniture, the leaves, roots and bark are also useful. For example, pine needles can be used to extract pine needle oil, pine needle tannin, make pine needle feed, pine needle fiberboard, white wine and rayon, etc. With more complex chemical treatment, it can also be made into the surgical drug – pine needle ointment.

Pine roots can be used to extract rosin and turpentine. After dry distillation, it can also produce pine tar, mineral processing oil, lubricating oil, asphalt and activated carbon, etc. Pine bark can also be leached to extract tannin. Pine needle oil can be used as a fragrance. Turpentine is an important raw material for the paint industry, rosin is an essential raw material for the soap, rubber and match industries, mineral processing oil can be used for flotation of non-ferrous metals, and tannin is an essential raw material for the leather industry.

The leaves and roots of camphor trees can be used to extract camphor oil and camphor, which are mainly used in national defense, medicine and celluloid industries.

Various tree barks are also indispensable industrial raw materials. Cork oak and Amur cork tree bark can be used to make cork bricks and cork paper, which are necessities for the mechanical industry. The leaves and bark of the Eucommia tree can be used to extract Eucommia gum, which can be used for tires, boot soles and chemical containers, etc. Eucommia bark can also be made into medicine. Birch bark can be used to extract birch bark tar and make birch bark paint. Mulberry bark and paper mulberry bark can be used to make paper. Mulberry leaves can also be used to raise silkworms, and eucalyptus leaves can be used to extract eucalyptus oil, which is used as a fragrance. Fir bark can be used as roofing tiles. Some tree barks can be used as medicine. Some tree barks with more cellulose can be used to make paper or rayon; some tree leaves can also be used as dyes. Therefore, some people say: a tree is a chemical factory, and this analogy is not an exaggeration. (Attached picture)

    树——全身是宝
    树木全身都有用，除了树干可以作各种建筑和车船、家具用材外，树叶、树根、树皮也都有用。如松树的针叶可以提炼松针油、松针栲胶、做松针饲料、松针纤维板、白酒和人造纤维等。如果用较复杂的化学处理，还可制成外科药剂——松针软膏。
    松树根可提炼松香、松节油。经过干馏处理还可制取松焦油、选矿油、润滑油、沥青和活性炭等。松树皮也可浸提出栲胶。松针油可用做香料。松节油是油漆工业的重要原料，松香是肥皂、橡胶和火柴等工业上的必需原料，选矿油可用于浮选有色金属，栲胶是制革工业的必需原料。
    樟树的叶和根可提炼樟脑油和樟脑，樟脑油和樟脑主要用于国防、医药和赛璐珞工业。
    各种树皮也是不可缺少的工业原料。栓皮栎和黄波萝树皮，可作软木砖和软木纸，这是机械工业的必需品。杜仲树的叶和皮可提炼出杜仲胶，这种胶可以作轮胎、靴底和化学药品的容器等。杜仲皮还可以做成药品。桦树皮可制取桦皮焦油，作桦皮漆。桑树皮和楮树皮可以造纸。桑叶还可养蚕，桉树叶可提炼桉叶油，用来作香料。杉树皮可作屋瓦。还有些树皮可以作药。有些含纤维素较多的树皮可以造纸或制人造纤维；有的树叶还可作染料。所以有人说：一个树就是一个化工厂，这个比喻一点也不过分。（附图片）
