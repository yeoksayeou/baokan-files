Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: Japanese two million teachers and government employees took simultaneous action across the country today to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," oppose the bill banning demonstrations around the Diet, oppose the forced implementation of the "Performance Rating" system, and demand a wage increase of 3,000 yen.

This action is part of the spring struggle led by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

About five thousand workers and students held a lantern rally in front of the Diet in Tokyo tonight, submitting a petition to the Diet demanding that it refuse to ratify the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," oppose the enactment of laws prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet, and abolish the "Performance Rating" system that controls the activities of teachers and staff. The Nobusuke Kishi government dispatched two thousand police officers to obstruct the petition.

Japanese Communist Party representative Yoshio Shiga and Socialist Party representative Kanju Kato spoke at the rally. They both emphasized the need to work hard to defeat the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempt to force the Diet to pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and enact laws prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet.

Afterwards, workers and students marched in an orderly fashion through the main streets in a demonstration.

Prior to this, two thousand three hundred teachers and staff in Tokyo also held a rally in front of the Diet to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's reactionary policies. Japanese Communist Party representative Yoshio Shiga and Socialist Party representative Kanju Kato stood on propaganda vehicles to address the rally and encourage the morale of the participants.

Today, local teachers and staff unions held mass rallies in Hokkaido, Iwate, Kyoto, Kochi, and Kanazawa to oppose the "Performance Rating" system. After holding the rallies, the teachers and staff unions held collective bargaining with local education authorities, demanding the cancellation of the decision to implement the "Performance Rating" system. Central and local government employees held workplace rallies today. Various private enterprise unions participated in today's action in various ways.

Many rallies sent letters and telegrams to the Nobusuke Kishi government, resolutely opposing the new "Security Treaty," opposing the reactionary bill prohibiting demonstrations, and opposing the "Performance Rating" system.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published an editorial today strongly opposing U.S. President Eisenhower and West German Chancellor Adenauer's visits to Japan.

The editorial said that Eisenhower, the mastermind behind oppressing the Japanese people and concluding the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and Adenauer, the culprit of reviving German militarism and threatening European peace, are invited by Nobusuke Kishi to visit Japan in late June and March 25th respectively. This is the greatest insult to the Japanese people who oppose the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that this is reminiscent of the time when Japan, Germany, and Italy formed a joint defense alliance during World War II, and therefore the Japanese people resolutely oppose Eisenhower and Adenauer's visit to Japan.

"Red Flag" pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government is plotting to use Eisenhower's visit to Japan as a way to salvage the crumbling position of Nobusuke Kishi, a faithful lackey of the United States.

The editorial pointed out that because Japan has concluded a military alliance with the United States, Japan's relations with the Soviet Union and China have fallen into crisis. At this time, Nobusuke Kishi is going to strengthen ties with the most brutal American imperialism and the German militarism that poses the greatest threat to European peace, which thoroughly exposes the ugly nature of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At the same time, it means that, under the direction of American imperialism, Japan will echo West Germany and once again become an aggressive base in the Far East.

    日本人民要击败岸信介的阴谋
    二百万教员和政府职员同时采取行动反对日美条约
    “赤旗报”发表社论反对艾森豪威尔和阿登纳访日
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本两百万教员和政府职员今天在全国各地同时采取行动，反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”，反对禁止在国会周围示威游行的法案，反对强制实行“勤务评定”制度，并且要求提高工资三千日元。
    这次行动是由日本工会总评议会所领导的春季斗争的一部分。
    东京今晚约有五千名工人和学生在国会门前举行提灯大会，向国会提交请愿书，要求国会拒绝批准新日美“安全条约”，反对制订禁止在国会周围示威游行的法律，废除控制教职员活动的“勤务评定”制度。岸信介政府出动了二千名警察来阻挠请愿。
    日本共产党代表志贺义雄和社会党代表加藤勘十在大会上讲了话。他们都强调要努力击败岸信介政府强使国会通过新日美“安全条约”和制定禁止在国会周围示威游行法律的企图。
    接着，工人和学生秩序井然地通过各主要街道举行了示威游行。
    在这以前，在东京的二千三百名教职员也在国会前面举行大会，反对岸信介政府的反动政治。日本共产党代表志贺义雄和社会党代表加藤勘十站在宣传车上向大会致词，鼓舞与会者的斗志。
    各地教职员工会今天在北海道、岩手、京都、高知和金泽等地方举行群众大会，反对“勤务评定”制度。在举行集会后，教职员工会同各地教育当局举行了集体谈判，要求取消实施“勤务评定”制度的决定。中央和地方政府职员今天举行了工作场所集会。各私营企业工会以各种方式参加了今天的行动。
    许多集会都向岸信介政府发出函电，坚决反对新“安全条约”、反对禁止示威游行的反动法案和“勤务评定”制度。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，强烈反对美国总统艾森豪威尔和西德总理阿登纳访问日本。
    社论说，压迫日本人民，缔结日美军事同盟的主持人艾森豪威尔和复活德国军国主义、威胁欧洲和平的罪魁阿登纳受岸信介的邀请将分别在6月下旬和3月25日访问日本。这是对反对修改日美“安全条约”的日本人民的最大侮辱。
    社论指出，这使人回忆起第二次世界大战中日、德、意三国缔结防共同盟时期的情景，因此日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔和阿登纳的访日。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介政府这样作是阴谋利用艾森豪威尔访日来作为挽救美国忠实奴仆的岸信介的摇摇欲坠的地位。
    社论指出，由于日美缔结了军事同盟，日本同苏中两国的关系已经陷入危机。正在这时候，岸信介又要同世界上最凶暴的美帝国主义和给欧洲和平造成最大威胁的德国军国主义加强联系，这就彻底暴露了新日美“安全条约”的丑恶本质。同时这意味着，在美帝国主义的指使下，日本将和西德相呼应重新变成在远东的侵略据点。
