Xinhua News Agency report: The large-scale spring fishing season production has already flourished in various places. More than 500,000 fishermen in coastal areas have gone to sea half a month to a month earlier than planned, and the number of fishing boats engaged in marine fishing has increased by 9% compared with the same period last year. There has also been a substantial increase in fishing gear compared to last year. Guangdong has added more than 530,000 sets of nets and more than one million hooks. Shandong has also added more than 90,000 fishing nets.

This year's spring fishing production equipment has undergone significant changes compared to previous years. The number of motorized sailing boats has more than doubled compared to the same period last year. In Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, operations have shifted from primarily relying on sailboats to motorized sailing boats, with nearly half of the county's fishermen boarding motorized sailing boats. Communication equipment has also grown from nothing to something, and from little to much. Coastal areas generally use radios, radiotelephones, or radios to direct production, forecast fishing conditions, and convey weather information.

This year, preparations for the spring fishing season started early, and action was taken quickly. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in Spring Fishing Season Production," the vast number of fishermen were filled with confidence and even more motivated. Various places have vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution. Most double trawlers in Guangdong have been converted to single trawlers. The trawling nets in Shandong, Liaoning, and other provinces have basically achieved light trawling. Fishing boats in various places are equipped with three to four or more types of tools to implement combined operations. Production safety work has also been greatly strengthened. In addition to communication equipment, navigation marks and lighthouses have been added to major fishing grounds, ports, and waterways before the fishing season in various places. The various levels of fishing season command headquarters, jointly established by relevant departments this year, are mostly headed by the Party Committee Secretary, which unites production, safety, and purchasing and marketing into one force, strengthens leadership, and strengthens cooperation.

In freshwater fishing areas, the harvesting of mature fish is also being stepped up. In Hubei Province, there are more than 20,000 boats fishing in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Hunan Province has organized a fishing force of 100,000 people, which not only catches major fish species but also focuses on the production of various small aquatic products.

Various provinces have also organized strong forces to focus on marine and freshwater aquaculture production. Coastal areas have made remarkable achievements in enclosing harbors for fish farming. Zhejiang has already enclosed more than 40,000 mu of harbors, and another 70,000 mu are under construction. Fujian has also enclosed 50,000 mu. The amount of kelp released in coastal provinces will double compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency report: The peak season for fish fry and fingerling production is approaching, and freshwater aquaculture areas across the country are seizing the opportunity to prepare for production, building fish ponds, raising broodstock, and vigorously training freshwater aquaculture personnel.

This year, the national freshwater aquaculture area will increase significantly compared to last year. Party committees in various places attach great importance to freshwater aquaculture production. The momentum of running fish fry farms is strong in the Subei area of Jiangsu Province: Yangzhou Prefecture is running 10,000, 1,000, and 100 mu farms by counties, communes, and brigades respectively; Yancheng Prefecture is running 10,000, 1,000, and 100 mu farms by prefecture, counties, and communes respectively. Zaoyang, Sui County, Xinzhou, Chongyang, and other places in Hubei Province will all be built into modern fish fry farms with more than 2,000 mu of fish ponds. In Heilongjiang Province, in addition to people's communes and state-owned aquaculture farms, factories, government agencies, and schools are also vigorously engaged in freshwater aquaculture. Shanxi Province is building ten new state-owned fish breeding farms.

The newly opened fish ponds in various places are generally combined with farmland water conservancy. Most of Shanxi Province uses barren alkaline land, and after renovation, fruit trees are planted in high places, and fish are raised in low-lying areas. Most of Fujian Province will use paddy fields to cultivate fish fry.

While excavating fish ponds, various places are also combining the catching and draining of mature fish to retain broodstock in preparation for egg collection and hatching. Hubei, Fujian, Hebei, and Liaoning have retained 1.8 million broodstock. Guangdong Province, which first promoted artificial hatching of silver carp and bighead carp, has already collected 150,000 silver carp and bighead carp broodstock this year. In Jiangxi Province, the precious red carp species hatched the first batch of fish fry in late February. Fujian Province has already hatched more than 100 million carp fry. The first batch of fish fry hatched in Hunan Province has been released into more than 1 million mu of water surface.

Preparations for collecting natural fish fry from rivers in provinces along the Yangtze River are also actively underway.

Various provinces have generally carried out training work to solve the problem of insufficient technical personnel.

    春季渔汛生产蓬勃展开
    全国淡水养殖地区积极准备鱼苗鱼种
    据新华社讯　规模巨大的渔业春汛生产已经在各地蓬勃展开。沿海已有五十多万渔民提前半个月至一个月出海，投入海洋捕捞的渔船已比去年同期增加9％。渔具也比去年大有增加。广东新增网具五十三万多领，钓一百多万枚。山东也新增渔网九万多领。
    今年海洋春汛的生产装备比往年有了很大变化。机帆船比去年同期增加一倍以上。浙江省舟山县已从原来以风帆船作业为主转变为以机帆船作业为主，全县近半数的渔民登上了机帆船。电讯设备也从无到有、从少到多。沿海各地普遍通过电台、报话机或收音机来指挥生产、预报渔情和传达气象消息。
    今年春汛准备早，行动快。中共中央、国务院发布“关于做好渔业春汛生产工作的指示”后，广大渔民信心倍增，干劲更足。各地大搞技术革新和技术革命。广东大部分双拖改为单拖。山东、辽宁等省的拖网基本上实现了轻拖化。各地渔船都配备了三到四种以上的工具，实行兼作生产。生产安全工作也大大加强。除了电讯设备外，各地汛前在主要渔场、港口、航道增添了航标、灯塔。今年由各有关部门联合组成的各级渔汛指挥部，大都由党委书记挂帅，使生产、安全和购销等扭成一股绳，加强了领导，密切了协作。
    在淡水渔区，目前也抓紧了成鱼捕捞。湖北省在江、河、湖泊打鱼的船只有两万多只。湖南省组织了十万人的渔业队伍，既捕捞主要鱼类，又抓各项小水产的生产。
    各省还组织强大力量抓海水淡水养殖生产。沿海地区在围港养鱼方面做出了显著成绩。浙江已围港四万多亩，正在动工的还有七万多亩。福建也已围好五万多亩。沿海各省放养的海带将比去年增加一倍。
    据新华社讯　鱼苗鱼种生产旺季即将到来，全国各淡水养殖地区正抓紧时机作好生产准备工作，大造鱼池，大抓亲鱼，大力培训淡水养殖人材。
    今年全国淡水养殖面积将比去年增加很多。各地党委对淡水养殖生产非常重视。江苏省苏北地区办鱼种场的声势浩大：扬州专区由县、公社、大队分办万、千、百亩场；盐城专区由专区、县、公社分办万、千、百亩场。湖北省枣阳、随县、新洲、崇阳等地都将建成拥有两千亩以上鱼池的现代化鱼种场。黑龙江省除人民公社和国营养殖场外，工厂、机关、学校也大搞淡水养殖。山西省正在新建十个国营鱼种繁殖场。
    各地新开鱼池普遍与农田水利相结合。山西省大部分利用荒滩碱地，整修以后，高处种果树，洼处养鱼。福建省将大部分利用稻田培育鱼种。
    与开挖鱼池同时，各地还结合捕涝成鱼留养亲鱼，准备采卵孵化。湖北、福建、河北、辽宁已留养亲鱼一百八十万尾。首先推广鲢、鳙鱼人工孵化的广东省，今年已经采集鲢、鳙亲鱼十五万尾。江西省的名贵品种红鲤鱼，2月下旬已经孵化出第一批鱼苗。福建省已经孵化出一亿多尾鲤鱼苗。湖南省第一批孵化的鱼苗，已放养在一百多万亩水面里。
    沿江各省采捞江河天然鱼苗的准备工作也在积极进行。
    各省普遍开展培训工作，解决技术力量不足的问题。
