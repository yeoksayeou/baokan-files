Xinhua News Agency, 26th — More than a thousand young people and students from all walks of life in the capital gathered this evening to warmly welcome the delegation of university workers from the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League and the delegation of Soviet children's workers.

When the Soviet delegation entered the venue, the entire audience burst into thunderous applause, and Chinese and Soviet youth sang in unison: "Moscow-Beijing." At this moment, the singing and applause merged into one, exciting the hearts of every young person.

Zhang Jinlin, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, spoke first at the meeting. He extended the warmest fraternal welcome to the delegation on behalf of all the members of the Communist Youth League and young people in Beijing.

Zhang Jinlin said that the Chinese youth are watching with admiration as the Soviet people and youth, under the leadership of the great Soviet Communist Party, are transforming the magnificent Seven-Year Plan into reality step by step with communist labor enthusiasm and unparalleled heroic spirit. All these achievements clearly demonstrate to the people of the world the superiority of the socialist system and the great vitality of communist ideology. The Chinese Communist Youth League and the Chinese youth have always regarded the Soviet Communist Youth League and the Soviet youth as their role models, learning from their advanced experience accumulated over a long period in the cause of revolution and construction. We are deeply convinced that the arrival of your delegation will greatly strengthen the friendship and unity between the youth of our two countries, and will also encourage our youth to work harder under the leadership of the Party to achieve a sustained leap forward in 1960. The Chinese youth will forever follow the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and will spare no effort to strengthen and develop the fraternal friendship and unity between the people and youth of our two countries.

Kuklinov, head of the Soviet Communist Youth League university workers delegation, and Fedotova, head of the Soviet children's workers delegation, spoke amid warm applause, conveying the cordial greetings of the Soviet Communist Youth League members, Soviet youth, and Soviet Young Pioneers to the Chinese Communist Youth League members, Chinese youth, and Young Pioneers, and warmly praising the close unity and friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union. Kuklinov said that the Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are a shock force in realizing the Great Leap Forward, and we are delighted by the outstanding achievements made by the Chinese youth in building socialism. Fedotova then spoke. She said that the task of the Soviet and Chinese Young Pioneers is to train children to become successors to the cause of communism. She also said: Soviet Young Pioneers not only take Zoya and Matrosov as examples, but also know the heroic deeds of Liu Hulan, Huang Jiguang, and Xu Xuehui.

At the meeting, representatives of the youth of China and the Soviet Union exchanged gifts as souvenirs.

Also present at the welcome meeting were Du Ping, Deputy Director of the School Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Zuo Lin, President of China Children's Newspaper, Qian Dawei, Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Zhou Shixian and Wang Jialiu, Deputy Secretaries of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and others.

After the welcome meeting, young people, students, and Young Pioneers from the capital performed wonderful artistic programs.
