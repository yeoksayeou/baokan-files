Development of Forestry Has Organizational Guarantee
Liu Chong, Deputy County Head of Qingyuan County, Liaoning Province

Qingyuan County is a rich mountainous area in northeastern Liaoning Province, with forests and abundant forest resources. After liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, great achievements have been made in forestry production and construction. At present, most of the trees have grown into dense forests, basically forming a timber base. At the same time, it has effectively controlled soil erosion, reduced natural disasters, and guaranteed agricultural harvests.

In 1958, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, forestry production also witnessed an unprecedented leap forward. Under this new situation, the original temporary shock-force forestry production teams and the smaller-scale forestry production teams run by a few advanced cooperatives became increasingly unsuitable. The emergence of people's communes brought bright prospects for forestry production. In the late summer of 1958, with the development of the people's commune movement, a high tide of establishing forest farms swept across the county while state-owned forest farms were being established on a large scale. On the original basis, the commune-run forest farms have developed to twenty-one, forming a complete network of commune-run forest farms throughout the county. The labor force of the forest farms has also increased from the original 1,500 to more than 2,100, making the strength even stronger.

The realization of forest farm management is a major turning point in transforming mass forestry production from a scattered temporary shock campaign to a concentrated, planned, and year-round production combined with large-scale mass movements. The forest farm is the foothold of forestry production in the people's commune, and it is the organizational guarantee for realizing the base construction, high-yield, and mechanization of forestry production. It adapts to the new situation of the great leap forward in forestry production, suits the urgent demands of the masses to actively engage in afforestation, and demonstrates incomparable superiority.

Because of the realization of forest farm management, forestry production has moved towards base construction. Before forest farm management, afforestation was scattered and piecemeal, without a relatively complete base. After the realization of forest farm management, the commune-run forest farms carried out reasonable tending of the large areas of commune-owned forests, promoting the rapid growth of trees; combined with tending, they also planned to produce 25,900 cubic meters of timber, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural construction, and initially forming a timber base and an economic forest base. In terms of seedling cultivation, the past scattered and piecemeal seedling cultivation methods have also been changed. In addition, most commune-run forest farms have established mushroom gardens and apiaries.

Forest farm management has also brought favorable conditions for realizing the high-yield cultivation of trees. The broad masses of commune members of the commune-run forest farms, because they have fixed professional teams, regard forestry production as their main business, actively study forestry technology, and become proficient in operation methods; in addition, each commune-run forest farm has cultivated various forestry technicians, greatly improving the quality of afforestation and achieving comprehensive high yields. In terms of seedling cultivation, generally, each hectare of seedlings produces more than 500,000 seedlings. In terms of afforestation, because the six fundamental measures for afforestation have been conscientiously implemented, the average survival rate of afforestation has reached over 85%. The mulberry trees planted by the Xiajiabao Commune-run Forest Farm, because the mountain land was prepared into terraces in advance and tended three times after planting, the afforestation survival rate reached 99%, and the average growth height in the first year reached over 70 centimeters. With the commune-run forest farms, the phenomenon of low survival rate and slow growth of young trees in the past decentralized afforestation has been basically eliminated, setting an example for realizing large-scale high-yield cultivation of trees.

Mechanization of forestry production is the long-cherished wish of the broad masses in mountainous areas. In the past, forestry production organizations were scattered or temporary, the scope of forestry production was small, and the time was short, so there was no strength to realize mechanization. For example, in seedling lifting operations, seedling lifting plows originally appeared as early as 1953, but because the area of decentralized seedling cultivation was too small and not suitable for mechanical operation, the seedling lifting plows have been idle for several years, and shovels and picks have been used instead. After the realization of forest farm management, the area of seedling cultivation was expanded, and production was concentrated. Last year, all seedling lifting plows were used to lift seedlings, realizing semi-mechanization of seedling lifting operations. Various commune-run forest farms have also launched a vigorous tool reform movement. In the past year, more than 20 kinds of forestry tools have been successfully reformed, creating a good start for the comprehensive realization of mechanization in forestry production.

This year, the county plans to afforest 19,950 hectares, including 10,000 hectares of timber forests and 3,250 hectares of economic forests; all will be constructed in accordance with the requirements of base construction, after planning and design. At the same time, the county will also establish 36 seedling cultivation bases in order to ensure the realization of afforestation base construction.

1960 will be a year of continued leap forward in forestry production in our county. We will hold high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and on the basis of having realized forest farm management, bravely advance along the direction of forestry production base construction, high-yield cultivation of trees, and mechanization of forestry tools.

    发展林业有了组织保证
    辽宁省清原县副县长　刘冲
    清原县是辽宁省东北部一个富饶的山区，境内森林遍布，林产资源丰富。解放后，由于党的正确领导，林业生产建设取得了很大的成就。目前绝大部分树木已郁闭成林，基本上形成了木材基地。同时，也有效地控制了水土流失，减免了自然灾害，保证了农业丰收。
    1958年，随着工农业生产大跃进，林业生产也出现了空前跃进的局面。在这种新的形势下，原来的临时突击性的林业生产队和少数高级社办的规模较小的林业生产队，就越来越显得不适应了。人民公社的出现，给林业生产带来了美好的前景。1958年夏末，随着人民公社化运动的发展，在全县大办国营林场的同时，各人民公社也掀起了一个大办林场的高潮。社办林场在原有基础上，已发展到二十一处，在全县范围内形成了一个完整的社办林场网。林场劳力也由原来的一千五百多人增加到二千一百多人，力量更加雄厚了。
    林场化的实现，是使群众性的林业生产由分散的临时突击运动，过渡到集中有计划的常年生产与大搞群众运动相结合的重大转折。林场是人民公社林业生产的落脚点，是实现林业生产基地化、丰产化、机械化的组织保证。它适应了林业生产大跃进的新形势，适合群众积极营林的迫切要求，显示了无比的优越性。
    由于实现了林场化，才使林业生产迈向基地化。在林场化以前，造林分散、零星，没有比较完整的基地。实现林场化后，各社办林场对大面积的公社所有林，进行了合理的抚育，促进了林木的迅速生育；结合抚育，还有计划的生产木材二万五千九百立米，有力的支援了工农业建设，初步形成了木材基地和经济林基地。育苗方面，也改变了过去分散的零星育苗方式。此外，大部社办林场都建立了木耳园和养蜂场。
    林场化又给实现林木培育丰产化带来了有利条件。社办林场的广大社员，由于固定了专业队伍，都把林业生产当成自己的主业，积极的钻研林业技术，熟练了作业方法；加上每个社办林场都培养了各种林业技术员，营林质量大大提高，获得了全面丰产。在育苗方面，一般苗木，每公顷产苗都达到五十万株以上。在造林方面，由于认真贯彻了造林六项根本措施，造林成活率平均达85％以上。夏家堡社办林场栽的桑树，由于事先把山地修成台地，栽后抚育了三次，造林成活率达99％，第一年生长高度平均达七十厘米以上。有了社办林场，基本上杜绝了过去分散造林时成活率不高、幼树生长慢的现象，为实现大面积林木培育丰产化作出了样子。
    林业生产机械化，这是广大山区群众多年的愿望。过去，林业生产组织是分散的或临时性的，林业生产范围小，时间短，没有力量实现机械化。例如起苗作业，本来早在1953年就出现了起苗犁，可是由于分散育苗的面积过小，不适于机械作业，几年来起苗犁一直闲着，而用锹起镐刨。实现了林场化，育苗面积扩大了，生产集中了，去年全部采用了起苗犁起苗，实现了起苗作业的半机械化。各个社办林场，还开展了轰轰烈烈的工具改革运动。一年来改革成功的林业工具就达二十多种，为林业生产全面实现机械化创造了良好的开端。
    今年全县计划造林一万九千九百五十公顷，其中用材林一万公顷，经济林三千二百五十公顷；全部按照基地化的要求，经过规划设计进行营造。同时全县还要建立三十六个育苗基地，以便保证造林基地化的实现。
    1960年将是我县林业生产继续跃进的一年，我们高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，在已实现林场化的基础上，沿着林业生产基地化、林木培育丰产化、林业工具机械化的方向奋勇前进。
