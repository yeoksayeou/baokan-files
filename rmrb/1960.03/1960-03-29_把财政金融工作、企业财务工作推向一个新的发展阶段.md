Deeply Mobilize the Masses and Further Improve Enterprise Financial Work

More than 90% of our country's fiscal revenue comes from state-owned enterprises' payments; more than 60% of fiscal expenditure is used for economic construction; and the vast majority of the state bank's credit funds are lent to enterprises for expanding production and commodity circulation. This situation shows that in the entire financial and banking work, enterprises occupy an extremely important position, both in terms of capital accumulation and in terms of capital allocation and use. Therefore, financial and banking staff must, under the leadership of the Party committee, cooperate with various departments of the national economy and enterprises to actively manage and distribute funds, carry out enterprise financial work, and economic accounting work, so as to better serve the Party's central tasks, serve the production increase and conservation campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and serve the high-speed development of production and construction.

Socialist financial and banking staff and enterprise financial staff should go deep into production, deep into the masses of workers, understand and be familiar with the use of funds in the production process and material circulation process, understand and be familiar with the production situation and the supply and use of materials, understand and be familiar with the changes and problems that occur in the production process and material circulation process, and actively assist enterprises in organizing production well, allocating and using funds and materials well, tapping the potential of funds and materials, and giving full play to the role of funds and materials. Capital is the monetary expression of materials. If materials are inappropriately stockpiled or wasted, capital will also be inappropriately stockpiled or wasted. If materials are used rationally, capital will also be used rationally. If the production of materials increases, the accumulation of capital will also increase. Capital and materials are two different things, but they are also a unified whole that is interconnected. If socialist financial and banking staff and enterprise financial staff only care about fiscal revenue and expenditure without caring about the production of enterprises, and without caring about the supply and rational use of materials, they will trap their work in a narrow circle, which is neither conducive to promoting the development of production, nor can make the financial and banking work and enterprise financial work better.

Socialist financial and banking staff and enterprise financial staff must actively do a good job in economic accounting. Socialist economic accounting is fundamentally different from capitalist economic accounting. The essence of capitalist economic accounting is to harm others and benefit oneself, and to be obsessed with profit. The essence of socialist economic accounting is to maximize the rational use of funds through active and correct work, and to give full play to the role of funds; to maximize the rational use of materials, and to give full play to the role of materials; to maximize the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses of workers, and to give full play to the role of people in production, in order to obtain the greatest production results with the least consumption, and to continuously increase accumulation and expand reproduction. In the final analysis, it is to increase production, practice thrift, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Socialist economic accounting must combine politics and economics, and leadership and the masses. It is necessary to combine the economic accounting of professional personnel with the mass economic accounting. We must strengthen and improve the economic accounting of professional personnel, and at the same time strengthen and develop mass economic accounting, and universally establish an economic accounting system in enterprises with the participation of the broad masses of workers—team accounting. The political consciousness of the masses of workers has been rapidly improved, and they are more concerned about production, concerned about the fruits of their labor, and demand to manage production, manage finances, and participate in economic accounting. The workers said well: "If you are in charge of the family, you must manage the family; if you manage the family, you must account for it; if you don't account for it, you are a muddle-headed manager." The participation of the masses in economic accounting is a mass movement with rich political and economic content. Through participating in this practical activity of economic accounting, the masses of workers can further give play to their initiative as masters of the house, improve their production knowledge and production skills, and learn the skills of managing enterprises, thereby further promoting the development of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and promoting the continuous advancement of production and construction. The participation of the masses in economic accounting is by no means an accidental and temporary phenomenon, but an inevitable product of the development of socialist production. The team accounting system that has now emerged is a very good organizational form for the masses to participate in economic accounting and participate in enterprise management. Attention should be paid to summarizing and promoting the experience in this area, and enriching its content.

Economic accounting is a specialized knowledge, with its technical and scientific nature. However, it can be gradually mastered by the masses. The masses are the direct creators of material wealth, and they know best about the various problems in the production process, so they are most able and easiest to combine their subjective initiative with solving practical problems in production, so that production continues to increase and costs continue to decrease. The many examples introduced by everyone at this meeting have fully illustrated this issue.

Mass economic accounting is the basis of the entire enterprise's economic accounting. Professional accounting personnel should conduct a comprehensive analysis and study of the enterprise's economic activities, summarize the experience of economic accounting work, systematize it, put it in order, and raise it to a theoretical level, and give the mass accounting frequent guidance. In this way, we can continuously develop and improve economic accounting, and have a positive effect on socialist economic construction.

Actively Participate in and Organize Socialist Large-Scale Collaboration

Socialist large-scale collaboration is an inevitable product of socialist economic development. The various aspects of the socialist economy are originally a unified whole that is interconnected and interdependent. This is the objective and true situation of the socialist economy. The establishment and division of labor of various departments of the national economy are only to facilitate the research and management of economic work, and to make economic work more effective. The socialist economy is a planned economy, and various economic departments and enterprises all carry out their work in accordance with the state's unified plan. However, the state's plan, the plans of various departments and enterprises, are always constantly broken through by the development and leap forward of production, and by technological innovation and technological revolution; and our planning work and the distribution and supply of materials are always unable to fully meet the actual situation of economic development. This requires the state planning organs, the various departments of the national economy, and the collaboration between departments and departments, enterprises and enterprises, and various units within enterprises, to frequently adjust and solve the problems that arise in the production development process, so that the national economic plan is further supplemented and improved.

The financial and banking departments are comprehensive departments, and have a direct and inevitable connection with various departments of the national economy, various enterprises, and various production units. They are relatively familiar with the economic activities of various departments and enterprises, and the problems that occur in the production process and material circulation process are also easily reflected in the changes in funds. Financial and banking staff should make full use of these characteristics, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, actively participate in and organize socialist large-scale collaboration between various departments and units. Through collaboration, under the guidance of the state plan, adjust the surplus and deficiency of materials, organize the exchange of experience and technology, and help backward units catch up with advanced units. If the problems that arise in the production process and the circulation process are resolved in a timely and reasonable manner, it will promote the development of production. At the same time, it can also accelerate the turnover of funds and expand the accumulation of funds. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the financial and banking departments of Yangpu District, Shanghai, under the leadership of the Party committee, have cooperated with relevant departments to organize large-scale collaboration between enterprises, and have solved more than 900 key production problems. Compared with the third quarter, the total industrial output value of the district increased by 25%, tax profits increased by more than 63 million yuan, the turnover of funds accelerated by 22%, and credit funds decreased by 3.4%. Their experience is worthy of research and learning.

Organizing socialist large-scale collaboration can not only produce huge economic effects, but also change people's thinking, establish a spirit of mutual assistance and love, promote the communist style, and make socialist production relations and productive forces, and the superstructure and economic base more compatible. This has a profound impact on our socialist and communist cause.

Actively Organize the Lives of Workers and Their Families

The financial and banking departments should closely cooperate with enterprises and other relevant departments (trade unions, women's federations, communist youth leagues, commercial departments, etc.), and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, actively organize the lives of workers and their families.

The key to organizing the lives of workers lies in organizing workers' families to participate in production and various service undertakings, mainly organizing workers' families to manufacture certain auxiliary materials and preliminary processing of raw materials for factories, and providing services such as washing, dyeing, and mending for workers. When the factory temporarily needs labor, give it active support within the possible scope. Factories can provide them with certain scraps and waste materials, as well as unnecessary equipment, and provide technical guidance. Organizing workers' families to participate in production should be adapted to local conditions and people, that is, organize whatever production can be organized, and participate in as much time as possible. In the process of organizing workers' families to participate in production, the financial and banking departments should also actively help them solve certain difficulties in terms of funds, help them train financial personnel, establish and improve management systems, and conduct economic accounting. In this way, factory production is further supported, social wealth is increased, workers' family income is increased, and workers' family life is improved. While organizing production, it is also necessary to organize various living and collective welfare undertakings centered on public canteens.

Actively help workers and their families arrange their income and expenditure, and actively organize savings under the principle of workers' consciousness and voluntariness. This can not only cultivate the habit of workers' families to plan expenditures, be diligent and thrifty in managing their families, but also promote family harmony, enhance social insurance, and further encourage workers to carry out production happily.

While organizing the lives of workers, we should also pay attention to organizing the lives of other residents in the city.

Organizing the lives of workers and urban residents is an important step in transforming old cities and building new cities, and is an important content of better serving the people, and has great political and economic significance.

Strengthen Financial Work in People's Communes, Organizations, and Cultural and Educational Undertakings

While strengthening enterprise financial work, the financial and banking departments must also cooperate with relevant departments to further strengthen the guidance and supervision of the financial work of the people's communes. There are now more than 25,000 people's communes in our country's rural areas, including more than 500 million people. Agricultural production is the foundation of our national economy. The financial and banking departments must promote the further development and consolidation of the people's communes and promote the development of agricultural production through various tasks. Under the leadership of the Party committee of the people's commune, rely on the masses to strengthen financial management, capital accumulation, allocation and use, and credit and savings work. Implement a democratic management system, announce the results of production and the accumulation and distribution of funds on time, and organize members to discuss, so that members are familiar with the production and economic activities in the commune and the results of their labor, encourage members to work hard to increase production and practice thrift, run the commune diligently and thriftily, manage their families diligently and thriftily, and adopt forms such as convening members' representative conferences to absorb the masses to participate in and supervise financial management.

Organizations, cultural and educational institutions, and all public institutions should practice thrift, tighten group purchasing power, rationally use administrative and operating expenses, cherish and save public utensils and articles, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily.

Within the financial and banking work, we must continue to pay attention to improving labor organization, improving rules and regulations, carrying out technological innovation, and striving to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in technical operations (counting banknotes, bookkeeping, calculating, packaging, etc.) in a not too long period of time.

Two Basic Problems in Financial and Banking Work

The above-mentioned problems can be summarized into two most basic problems. One is how to closely combine financial and banking work with production and construction, and support and promote the high-speed development of production and construction; the other is how to combine financial and banking work with the broad masses, better serve the masses, and work together with the masses to do a good job in financial and banking work. We advocate actively organizing and arranging funds for enterprises (and other production units) through financial and banking work; assisting enterprises in discovering and solving problems existing in production, discovering and solving problems existing in the supply and use of materials; assisting enterprises and the masses of workers in doing a good job in production and construction, and working together with enterprises and workers to do a good job in the management, allocation and accumulation of funds. We oppose not starting from production, and not developing financial and banking work from actively participating in production and promoting production development; we oppose seeing money but not seeing materials, seeing materials but not seeing people, and limiting our work to a narrow and static scope. We advocate that in carrying out all work, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses; we must actively participate in organizing the lives of the people through financial and banking work, rationally arrange the income and expenditure of the masses, educate the masses to be diligent and thrifty in managing their families; we must go deep into the masses, widely carry out political and ideological work among the masses, and work together with the masses to do a good job in financial and banking work. We oppose not believing in the masses, not relying on the masses, not caring about the lives of the masses, not listening to the opinions of the masses, not solving the urgent needs of the masses that can be solved; we oppose separating our work from the lives of the masses, from political and ideological work among the masses, and from mass movements.

These are two obviously different views and methods, and will inevitably produce obviously different results. The former view and method will produce positive and good results in improving the political consciousness of the masses, giving play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and in developing production and construction and carrying out financial and banking work; while the latter view and method will not produce this result, and may even produce the opposite result. We should educate and help all financial and banking staff and enterprise financial staff to establish and develop the former view and method, overcome and change the latter view and method, and correctly carry out their work.

All our achievements in work have been made under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of China, and is the guide for our country to victoriously carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must conscientiously study the works of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the Party's general line, and advance courageously towards our great socialist and communist goals with high spirits.

    把财政金融工作、企业财务工作推向一个新的发展阶段
    中共中央财贸工作部部长　马明方
    深入发动群众，进一步做好企业财务工作
    我们国家的财政收入，90％以上来自国营企业的缴款；财政支出，60％以上用于经济建设；国家银行的信贷资金，绝大部分贷给企业用于扩大生产和扩大商品流通。这种情况说明，在整个财政银行工作中，无论在资金的积累方面，无论在资金的分配和使用方面，企业都居于极为重要的地位。因此，财政银行工作人员必须在党委领导下，协同国民经济各部门和企业单位积极地做好资金的管理分配工作、企业财务工作、经济核算工作，更好地为党的中心工作服务，为以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动服务，为促进生产建设高速度发展服务。
    社会主义的财政银行工作人员，企业财务工作人员，要深入到生产中，深入到职工群众中，了解和熟悉在生产过程和物资周转过程中资金使用的情况，了解和熟悉生产情况和物资供应与使用情况，了解和熟悉在生产过程中和物资周转过程中所发生的变化和问题，积极协助企业把生产组织好，把资金和物资分配好、使用好，挖掘资金和物资的潜力，充分发挥资金和物资的作用。资金是物资的货币表现，物资被不适当地积压了、被浪费了，资金也就被不适当地积压了、被浪费了；物资使用得合理了，资金也就使用得合理了；物资的生产增加了，资金的积累也就增加了。资金和物资是两种不同的东西，又是互相联系着的统一体。社会主义的财政银行工作人员、企业财务人员如果只关心财政收支而不关心企业的生产，不关心物资的供应和合理使用，那就会把自己的工作陷于狭窄的圈子里，既不利于促进生产的发展，也不能把财政银行工作、企业财务工作做得更好。
    社会主义的财政银行工作人员，企业财务工作人员必须积极做好经济核算工作。社会主义的经济核算根本不同于资本主义的经济核算。资本主义的经济核算的本质，是损人利己，唯利是图，社会主义的经济核算，则是通过积极的正确的工作，最大限度地使资金使用得合理，充分发挥资金的作用；最大限度地使物资使用得合理，充分发挥物资的作用；最大限度地发扬职工群众的积极性和首创精神，充分发挥人在生产中的作用，以便用最少的消耗取得最大的生产成果，不断地增加积累，扩大再生产。归根到底，就是为了增加生产，厉行节约，多快好省地建设社会主义。
    社会主义的经济核算，必须是政治与经济、领导与群众相结合的。必须把专业人员的经济核算同群众性的经济核算结合起来。要加强和提高专业人员的经济核算，同时要加强和发展群众性的经济核算，在企业中普遍建立有广大职工群众参加的经济核算制度——班组核算。职工群众政治觉悟迅速提高了，他们就更加关心生产，关心自己的劳动成果，要求管理生产，管理财务，参加经济核算。工人说得好：“当家必管家，管家必核算，如果不核算，当的糊涂家”。群众参加经济核算，是一个有丰富的政治内容和经济内容的群众运动。职工群众通过参加经济核算这个实际活动，就能够进一步发挥当家作主的积极性，提高生产知识和生产技能，学会管理企业的本领，从而就进一步促进了技术革命和文化革命的发展，促进生产建设的不断前进。群众参加经济核算，绝不是一种偶然的暂时的现象，它是社会主义生产发展的必然产物。现在出现的班组核算制，是群众参加经济核算、参加企业管理的一种很好的组织形式，要注意总结和推广这方面的经验，充实和丰富它的内容。
    经济核算是一种专门知识，有它的技术性、科学性。但是，它可以被群众逐步掌握。群众是物质财富的直接创造者，他们最了解生产过程中的各种问题，因而也就最能够和最容易把他们的主观能动性同解决生产中的实际问题结合起来，使生产不断增加，成本不断降低。这次会议上大家介绍的许多事例，已经充分说明了这个问题。
    群众性的经济核算是整个企业的经济核算的基础。专业核算人员应该对企业的经济活动进行全面的分析研究，总结经济核算工作的经验，使之系统化、条理化，提高到理论水平，给群众核算以经常的指导。这样，我们就可以使经济核算不断地得到发展和提高，对社会主义经济建设发生积极的作用。
    积极参与和组织社会主义大协作
    社会主义大协作是社会主义经济发展的必然产物。社会主义经济的各个方面，本来就是互相联系，互相依存的统一体，这是社会主义经济的客观真实状况。国民经济各部门的设置和分工，只是为了便于对经济工作进行研究和管理，把经济工作做得更有成效些。社会主义经济是计划经济，各个经济部门，各企业单位都是按照国家的统一计划来进行自己的工作的。但是，国家的计划，各部门和各企业的计划，总是不断地被生产的发展和跃进所突破，被技术革新和技术革命所突破；而我们的计划工作、物资的分配和供应工作，也总是不能完全符合经济发展的实际情况。这就需要通过国家计划机关，通过国民经济各部门，通过部门与部门、企业与企业、企业内部各单位之间的协作，对于生产发展过程中出现的问题，经常地进行调整和解决，使得国民经济计划进一步得到补充和完善。
    财政银行部门是综合性部门，同国民经济各部门、各企业、各生产单位有着直接的必然的联系，对各部门、各企业的经济活动情况比较熟悉，在生产过程和物资周转过程中发生的问题，也容易在资金的变化上得到反映。财政银行工作人员应该充分利用这些特点，在党委统一领导下，积极参与和组织各部门、各单位之间的社会主义大协作。通过协作，在国家计划指导下，调剂物资的余缺，组织经验和技术的交流，帮助落后单位赶上先进单位。生产过程和流通过程中出现的问题，得到及时地合理地解决，就会促进生产的发展。同时，也就可以加速资金的周转，扩大资金的积累。上海市杨浦区财政银行部门去年第四季度以来在党委领导下，协同有关部门，组织企业与企业之间的大协作，解决了九百多项生产关键问题，第四季度与第三季度比较，全区工业产值增长了25％，税收利润增加了六千三百多万元，资金周转加快22％，信贷资金下降3．4％，他们的经验是值得研究和学习的。
    组织社会主义大协作，不仅可以产生巨大的经济效果，还可以改变人们的思想面貌，树立互助友爱的精神，发扬共产主义的风格，使社会主义的生产关系和生产力、上层建筑和经济基础更加相适应。这对于我们的社会主义和共产主义事业，有着极为深远的影响。
    积极组织职工和职工家属的生活
    财政银行部门应当同企业及其他各有关部门（工会、妇联、共青团、商业部门等）密切协作，在党委统一领导下，积极组织职工和职工家属的生活。
    组织职工生活的关键，在于组织职工家属参加生产和各种服务事业，主要是组织职工家属为工厂制造某些辅助材料和原料的初步加工，为职工进行洗染、缝补等服务事业，在工厂临时需要劳力时，在可能范围内给以积极支持。工厂可以把某些下脚材料和废料以及不需要的设备供给他们，并在技术上给以指导。组织职工家属参加生产，应当因人因地制宜，即能组织什么生产，就组织什么生产，能参加多少时间，就参加多少时间。财政银行部门在组织职工家属参加生产过程中，还应当积极帮助他们解决资金上的某些困难，帮助他们训练财务人员，建立和健全管理制度，进行经济核算。这样，就进一步支持了工厂生产，增加了社会财富，增加了职工家庭收入，改善了职工家庭生活。在组织生产的同时，还必须组织好以公共食堂为中心的各项生活和集体福利事业。
    积极帮助职工和职工家属安排好收支用度，并在职工自觉自愿的原则下，积极组织储蓄。这不仅可以养成职工家属计划开支，勤俭持家的风气，还可以促进家庭和睦，增强社会保险，更加鼓励职工心情愉快地进行生产。
    组织职工生活的同时还应当注意组织城市其他居民的生活。
    组织职工和城市居民的生活是改造旧城市建设新城市的一个重要步骤，是更好地为人民服务的重要内容，具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。
    加强人民公社、机关团体、文教事业方面的财务工作
    财政银行部门在加强企业财务工作的同时，还必须协同有关部门进一步加强对人民公社财务工作的指导和监督。我国农村现在有两万五千多个人民公社，包括五亿多人口。农业生产是我们国民经济的基础。财政银行部门必须通过各项工作，促进人民公社的进一步发展和巩固，促进农业生产的发展。在人民公社党委领导下，依靠群众加强财务管理工作，资金的积累、分配和使用工作，信贷储蓄工作。实行民主管理的财务制度，按时公布生产的结果和积累、分配的情况，并组织社员进行讨论，使社员熟悉社内生产和经济活动的情况和自己劳动的成果，鼓励社员努力增产节约，勤俭办社、勤俭持家，采取召开社员代表大会等形式，吸收群众参加和监督财务管理工作。
    机关团体和文化教育机关及一切事业单位应当厉行节约，紧缩集团购买力，合理使用行政费和事业费，爱护和节约公共用具和物品，勤俭办好一切事业。
    在财政银行工作内部，要继续注意改进劳动组织，改进规章制度，开展技术革新，争取在一个不太长的时间内，在技术操作方面（点票子、记账、计算、包扎等）实现机械化、半机械化。
    财政银行工作中的两个基本问题
    上面所说的问题，归纳起来，最基本的是两个问题。一是如何把财政银行工作同生产建设紧密地结合起来，支持和促进生产建设的高速度发展；一是如何把财政银行工作同广大群众结合起来，更好地为群众服务，并同群众一起做好财政银行工作。我们主张通过财政银行工作，积极地为企业（以及其他生产单位）组织和安排资金；协助企业发现和解决生产中存在的问题，发现和解决物资供应和使用中存在的问题；协助企业和职工群众做好生产建设工作，并同企业和职工一起做好资金的管理、分配和积累工作。反对不从生产出发，不从积极参与生产、促进生产发展中去发展财政银行工作；反对见钱不见物，见物不见人，把自己的工作局限在狭窄的静止的范围以内。我们主张在进行一切工作中，都必须相信群众，依靠群众；必须通过财政银行工作，积极参与组织人民的生活，合理地安排群众的收支用度，教育群众勤俭持家；必须深入群众，在群众中广泛地进行政治思想工作，并同群众一起做好财政银行工作。反对不相信群众，不依靠群众，不关心群众的生活，不听取群众的意见，不解决群众迫切需要而又可能解决的问题；反对把自己的工作同群众的生活，同群众中的政治思想工作，同群众运动割裂开来。
    这是两种显然不同的观点和方法，必然会产生显然不同的结果。前一种观点和方法，对于提高群众的政治觉悟，发挥群众的革命积极性和创造性，对于发展生产建设，开展财政银行工作，都会产生积极的良好的结果；而后一种观点和方法，则不能产生这种结果，甚至会产生与此相反的结果。我们应当教育和帮助所有财政银行工作人员、企业财务工作人员树立和发展前一种观点和方法，克服和改变后一种观点和方法，正确地进行自己的工作。
    我们工作中的一切成就，都是在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下取得的。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国具体实践相结合的典范，是我国胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指针。我们必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，向着我们伟大的社会主义和共产主义的目标，意气风发地奋勇前进。
