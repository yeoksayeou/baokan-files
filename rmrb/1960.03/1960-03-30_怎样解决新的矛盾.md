How to Resolve New Contradictions
　　Chu Xue

Things always move forward in a continuous struggle of contradictions. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions emerge. Since the beginning of this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement carried out across the country and in all walks of life has rapidly changed backward production conditions with the force of a storm. More and more regions, industries, factories, and mining enterprises have been freed from heavy labor and have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, and some have even achieved automation and semi-automation. Under this new situation, many regions and enterprises have experienced new contradictions: After a large number of new equipment is manufactured, some workers cannot master the new operating techniques for a while, so that the new equipment cannot give full play to its role; the production management of some enterprises has not kept up with the development of production technology; a large number of technological innovations have rapidly increased production capacity, and the supply of certain raw materials, fuels, and electricity appears to be insufficient…

The emergence of these contradictions shows that the powerful technical innovation movement has broken the old balance in production and a new imbalance has emerged. This is a leap forward on the economic front. Resolving these new contradictions and forming a new balance at a new and higher level will lead to another leap forward. We should seize the opportunity to resolve these new contradictions and strive to quickly form a new balance.

How can we resolve these new contradictions that have emerged in the technical innovation movement? There are two different ideas among the leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises: one is to combine the resolution of these new contradictions in the process of continuing to carry out the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation movement; the other is to stop the movement and resolve the contradictions statically and in isolation. Obviously, the latter idea does not conform to the spirit of the general line and the laws of development of the movement. Technical revolution is a basic point of the general line, and mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation are the central links of the current technical revolution. Adherents of the theory of continuous revolution should make the technical revolution develop unceasingly, and should continuously promote the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation movement, so as not to make it stagnate. In fact, only in the mass movement can various contradictions be resolved smoothly, and a new positive balance can be achieved in the movement. Problems such as the shortage of electricity, certain raw materials, and fuels need to be solved by relying on the technical innovation movement. Guangdong Province has adopted the practice of continuing to promote the technical innovation movement and combining it with the resolution of new contradictions, which has achieved good results. In the face of new contradictions, what kind of practice can promote the continuous advancement of the wheel of technical revolution? Guangdong's experience is a very good answer.

    怎样解决新的矛盾
    楚雪
    事物总是在不断的矛盾斗争中向前发展的。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会露头。今年以来全国各地、各行各业开展的技术革新和技术革命运动，以急风骤雨之势，迅速改变着落后的生产条件。越来越多的地区、行业、厂矿企业摆脱了笨重劳动，基本实现了机械化、半机械化，有的甚至还实现了自动化、半自动化。在这种新情况下，不少地区、企业又出现了新的矛盾：大量新设备制成以后，有些工人一时掌握不了新的操作技术，以致新设备不能充分发挥作用；有些企业的生产管理工作没有紧紧跟上生产技术的发展；大量革新技术，生产能力迅速提高，某些原材料、燃料、电力显得供应不足……。
    这些矛盾的出现，表明威力巨大的技术革新运动冲破了生产中旧的平衡，出现了新的不平衡。这是经济战线上的一种跃进。解决了这些新的矛盾，在新的更高的水平上组成新的平衡，就又会跃进一步。我们应该抓紧解决这些新的矛盾，争取迅速组成新的平衡。
    怎样解决技术革新运动中出现的这些新的矛盾呢？厂矿企业的领导干部当中有两种不同的想法：一种是在继续开展机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化运动的过程中，结合解决这些新的矛盾；另一种是想把运动停下来，静止地、孤立地去解决矛盾。显然，后一种想法是不符合总路线的精神和运动的发展规律的。技术革命是总路线的一个基本点，而机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，是当前技术革命的中心环节。不断革命论者应该使技术革命永不停止地发展下去，应该不断推进机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化运动，不使它停滞不前。事实上，也只有在群众运动中才能顺利解决各种矛盾，在运动中才能求得新的积极的平衡。像电力、某些原材料、燃料不足等问题，更是需要依靠技术革新运动来解决。广东省采取了继续推进技术革新运动，结合解决新矛盾的作法，收到了良好的效果。在新的矛盾面前，采取什么样的作法，才能促使技术革命的车轮不断滚滚向前？广东的经验是个很好的答案。
