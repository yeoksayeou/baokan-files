_People's Daily_, Changchun, March 14th (Reporter Chen Zilin): Jilin Province's technological innovation and revolution movement has become a movement of the entire people. Since December of last year, the tide of the movement has rapidly expanded from some large cities to the vast number of small and medium-sized cities and towns; from industry, transportation, and construction to finance, commerce, service industries, and cultural and health departments. Currently, over 90% of the province's 760,000 employees are demonstrating their skills in eliminating heavy labor and manual operations.

This movement, with "five-izations" (semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, automation, continuous production), "double-doubling" (renovating production technology and equipment, doubling production capacity), and "three-improvements" (improving ideology, improving technology and culture, improving enterprise management) as its content, is developing towards a deeper, broader, and higher stage.

The current situation of the movement is extremely good. Leaders at all levels adhere to putting politics in command, implement the Party's instructions with great determination and swift action; "Mobilize from top to bottom, grasp big and small simultaneously, integrate indigenous and foreign methods" – the direction is clear, and the slogans are loud and clear. Therefore, the movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth. The ambition of the workers, the speed of their actions, the breadth of innovation, and the magnitude of the results are unprecedented. The revolutionary style of the people is: "The more we reform, the more we want to; the more we do, the more we dare to." The leap-forward development of "one person doing the work of several, one machine doing the work of several, one factory doing the work of several" has become a general trend. Currently, there are more than 400 large, medium, and small factories across the province that have achieved or are in the process of achieving "one factory doing the work of several."

A prominent feature of the mass innovation movement is the shift from sporadic and partial technological reforms in the past to large-scale and comprehensive technological transformation of entire enterprises and entire industries. This reform is no longer limited to simple operational methods or partial reforms of equipment and tools, but rather innovates the entire production method, equipment structure, product structure, and changes the entire assembly line or production layout. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the province's industrial, transportation, and infrastructure enterprises has increased from 38% at the beginning of the year to about 50% at present. There are 468 factories in the province that have developed from manual operations to mechanization and semi-mechanization, 135 factories that have developed from semi-mechanization to mechanization, and more than 500 automated production lines, 1,153 continuous production lines, and 2,762 automated machine tools have emerged. The proportion of workers engaged in manual labor has decreased from 61.8% at the beginning of the year to 53.8%, liberating more than 50,000 people from heavy labor. Whether it is a modern large factory equipped with new technology or a small and medium-sized enterprise with a high proportion of manual operations, they are all undergoing major reforms and innovations without exception. The First Automobile Factory, guided by the principle of "250 vehicles per shift, one factory becomes five," is carrying out comprehensive innovation in all workshops. More than 70% of the factory's equipment has achieved a production level of 250 vehicles per shift. Most of the enterprises in Changchun's Erdaohazi District are small and medium-sized old enterprises, but in just one month, the degree of mechanization increased by 30%. In particular, the transportation and infrastructure departments have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of a large amount of manual operation and heavy physical labor. Semi-mechanization, mechanization, or automation have begun to be implemented in pulp production, tofu processing, grain and oil sales, canteens, and even counting banknotes.

In technological innovation in various places, the promotion of advanced experiences has rapidly developed from one workshop or one factory promoting single and dispersed experiences to a comprehensive coordination of advanced experiences in various industries, thereby rapidly transforming individual and partial advanced production levels into social production levels. In promoting advanced experiences, enterprises have adopted forms such as "on-site meetings," "technical demonstrations," "large-scale battles," "learning and contributing treasures," and "large-scale cooperation," which are lively, colorful, and effective. The innovative experiences of more than ten industries, including transportation, infrastructure, electromechanical, casting, forging, and fitting in the machinery industry, as well as papermaking, cotton weaving, oil and wine making, and glass in the light industry, have been coordinated into "dragons," generally increasing production efficiency by more than one time. In Changchun's basic construction department, 45 sets have been coordinated into "dragons" in ten major types of work and 138 work processes, increasing production efficiency by one to four times.

While focusing on solving manual operations and heavy physical labor, workers in Jilin Province are also adopting new technologies in large quantities with indomitable spirit, rushing towards the peak of science and technology, and striving to master and apply the latest technological achievements in modern industry at the fastest speed. The First Automobile Factory has adopted and successfully trial-manufactured 59 items, including electrostatic spraying, automatic silent molding machines, gear circular broaching machines, and program control, all of which are cutting-edge technologies and products representing the latest technological achievements in modern industry. The employees of Jilin Electric Power Bureau, with great skill and ingenuity, made a set of remote control devices, and the substation no longer needs dedicated personnel on duty. The electronic automatic control metering instrument created by the employees of Changchun Xiuli Grain Station increases labor efficiency by 20 times, and the accuracy is higher than that of scales, thereby realizing the automation of grain and oil sales. The mass scientific research activities that accompany the conquest of technological frontiers have been carried out more extensively, which has more powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the technological revolution movement. The workshops, work sections, and teams of Jilin Chemical Company have established scientific and technological research groups, with 5,000 people participating in more than 500 scientific and technological research groups. These groups are combined with the enterprise's professional research institutions to form a powerful scientific and technological research network; from January to now, they have proposed more than 8,800 research projects around the realization of innovation plans, of which 553 have been realized.

Vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization, utilizing national resources in the most reasonable, economical, and full way, producing a variety of products, realizing multiple uses for one item, and multiple functions for one factory, and developing towards multi-variety joint enterprises or integrated factories is another feature of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in Jilin Province. In industries such as chemical, forestry, papermaking, pharmaceutical, winemaking, and grain processing, they are fully utilizing raw materials on the one hand to achieve the best use of materials and are searching for substitutes in many ways; on the other hand, they are recovering and utilizing waste materials in large quantities to increase the production of new products. The employees of Jilin Chemical Industry Company, with the spirit of "absorbing exhaust gas, drinking dry wastewater, and eating all waste residue," launched a mass movement to seize treasures from waste. They conducted a general survey of more than 100 types of waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue in the entire company, and ascertained the composition of each type of waste, and then tried every means to process and utilize it. Jilin Fertilizer Plant recovers the released carbon dioxide gas, which can produce 20,000 tons of alkali and 80,000 tons of urea a year. Jilin Dyestuff Factory has used waste liquid to make important products such as sulfide alkali, hydrochloric acid, carbon black, tanning agents, zinc oxide, and zinc carbonate. In order to comprehensively develop and utilize forest resources, by the end of last year, 15 forestry industry bureaus in the province had established 75 fiberboard manufacturing and forest chemical processing plants. These small factories that combine indigenous and foreign methods produced 15 kinds of products such as tannin extract, fiberboard, activated carbon, rosin, alcohol, etc., totaling more than 8,000 tons last year, using waste materials such as branches, bark, sawdust, pine roots, Mingzi, and pine needles. At present, the forestry bureaus are stepping up the construction of more than 600 "small indigenous groups," striving to achieve that every logging site has an integrated utilization factory, and every factory (sawmill and timber processing plant) has an integrated utilization workshop within the year.

Jilin Province has mastered the following main experiences in the great technological innovation and technological revolution movement: (1) The technological innovation and technological revolution movement is not only a production movement but also an ideological movement for the self-transformation of the masses of employees. The technological revolution is the result of the ideological revolution; the ideological revolution promotes the development of the technological revolution. (2) Three-way combination inside and outside the factory, comprehensive cooperation. The more the movement develops, the more it needs to develop "three-way combination," and the more it needs to organize comprehensive cooperation between factories, between industries, between departments, between cities, and between regions; the wider the scope of cooperation, the richer the content, and the greater the strength. (3) Technological innovation and technological revolution are closely integrated with current production and the improvement of enterprise management, which can not only ensure the completion of the national plan but also continuously enrich and develop the content of enterprise management, promote the high-speed development of productive forces, and promote a greater upsurge in mass movements. (4) Proceed from reality and walk on two legs. There are both reforms from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization, as well as reforms from mechanization to automation. At the same time, combine the manufacturing of high-efficiency simple equipment with the transformation of existing equipment, and combine partial reforms with comprehensive technological transformation; both grasp the common and large number of existing problems, and grasp the high, precise, cutting-edge, and new, both carry out comprehensive work and carry out key work. (5) Ideological revolution, technological revolution, and cultural revolution are complementary and must be combined with each other. As the movement develops in depth, the organization of labor changes, the number of production workers decreases relatively, and the requirements for workers in production are getting higher and higher, requiring them not only to understand production but also to understand how to adjust and repair machines. This requires workers to be multi-skilled and have a higher cultural level, scientific and technological knowledge, and a higher political awareness, only in this way can they undertake increasingly complex tasks.

    上下一齐动　大小一齐抓　土洋一齐搞　越革越想革　越干越敢干
    吉林全民大显身手全面革新技术
    四百多工厂实现“一厂顶数厂”，五万多人摆脱笨重体力劳动，成百成千自动线和连续线涌现出来
    本报长春14日电　记者陈子林报道：吉林省的技术革新和技术革命运动，已成为全民的运动。从去年12月份以来，运动的浪潮从一些大城市，迅速扩展到广大中小城市和乡镇；从工业、交通、建筑业，席卷到金融、商业、服务行业和文化卫生部门。目前，全省七十六万职工中，有90％以上的人在为革除笨重劳动和手工操作大显身手。
    这个运动以“五化”（半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化、连续化）、“双翻”（生产技术设备翻新、生产能力翻番）、“三提高”
  （提高思想、提高技术和文化、提高企业管理）为内容，正向着更深入、更广泛和更高的阶段发展。
    目前运动发展的形势极好。各级领导坚持政治挂帅，贯彻党的指示，决心很大，雷厉风行；“上下一齐动，大小一齐抓，土洋一齐搞”，方向明确，口号响亮。因此，运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。职工们雄心之大，行动之快，革新之广，成果之巨，前所未有。人们的革命风格是：“越革越想革，越干越敢干”。生产上“一人顶数人、一机顶数机、一厂顶数厂”的飞跃发展，已成了普遍的趋势。现在全省已经实现和正在实现“一厂顶数厂”的大中小工厂达四百多个。
    全民性革新运动的一个明显特点，就是由过去零星的部分的技术改革，发展到整个企业、整个行业的大规模的全面技术改造。这种改革，已经不限于简单的操作方法或是设备工具的局部改革，而是革新整个生产方法、设备结构、产品结构，改变整个作业线或生产平面布置。全省工业交通和基建企业的机械化、半机械化程度，已由年初的38％提高到目前的50％左右，全省由手工操作发展到机械化、半机械化的工厂已有四百六十八个，由半机械化发展到机械化的工厂有一百三十五个，并且涌现出五百多条自动化生产线，一千一百五十三条连续生产线和二千七百六十二台自动化机床。从事手工劳动的工人比重，已由年初的61．8％降低到53．8％，有五万多人从笨重的劳动中解放出来。无论是用新技术装备起来的现代化大工厂，或是手工操作比重极大的中小企业，都无例外地在进行大改大革。第一汽车厂以“班产二百五十，一厂变五厂”为纲，各车间都在进行全面革新，全厂已有70％以上的设备，实现了班产二百辆分汽车的生产水平。长春二道河子区的企业多是中小型旧企业，只用一个月时间，机械化比重就提高了30％。特别是运输、基建部门，大量的手工操作和笨重体力劳动已实现了机械化、半机械化。制浆、豆腐加工、售粮油、食堂以及点钞票，都开始实现半机械化、机械化或自动化。
  各地在技术革新中，都由一个车间或一个厂推广单项分散的先进经验，迅速发展为各个行业的先进经验全面配套，从而把个别、局部的先进生产水平迅速变为社会生产水平。在推广先进经验中，各企业采用了“现场会议”、“技术表演”、“大会战”、“取经献宝”、“大协作”等形式，生动活泼，丰富多彩，收效显著。交通运输、基本建设、机械工业中的机电、铸、锻、钳，以及轻工业中的造纸、棉织、油酒、玻璃等十多个行业的革新经验，都已搭配成“龙”，生产效率一般都提高一倍以上。长春基本建设部门在十个主要工种、一百三十八个工序中，搭配成“龙”的有四十五套，生产效率提高一倍至四倍。
    吉林省职工在着重解决手工操作和笨重体力劳动同时，更以百折不挠的精神，大量采用新技术，向科学技术高峰飞奔，力争以最快的速度，把现代工业中最新的技术成就掌握和运用起来。第一汽车厂已经采用和试制成功的静电喷漆、自动无声造型机、齿轮圆拉机、程序控制等五十九项，都是代表现代工业中最新技术成就的尖端技术和尖端产品。吉林电业局职工志大手巧，制成一套遥控装置，变电所已不再需要专门值班人员。长春秀丽粮站职工创造的电子自动控制计量仪，劳动效率提高二十倍，准确程度比磅秤还高，从而实现了售粮售油自动化。伴随着攻占技术尖端而来的群众性的科学研究活动，已更加广泛开展起来，这就更有力地促进了技术革命运动的深入发展。吉林化学公司各车间、工段、班组，都建立起科学技术研究小组，有五千人参加了五百多个科学技术研究组。这些小组同企业的专业研究机构结合，形成一个强大的科学技术研究网；从1月到现在，他们围绕实现革新规划，提出八千八百多个研究项目，已实现的有五百五十三项。
    大搞综合利用，最合理、最节约、最充分地利用国家资源，生产多种产品，实现一物多用，一厂多能，朝着多品种的联合企业或综合工厂方向发展，是吉林省技术革新和技术革命运动的另一个特点。在化工、森林、造纸、制药、酿酒、粮米加工等行业，都在一面充分利用原料，达到物尽其用，多方寻找利用代用品；一面大量回收和利用废料，增加新产品生产。吉林化学工业公司职工以“吸尽废气、喝干废水、吃光废渣”的气概，掀起了向废物夺宝的群众运动。他们普查了全公司一百多种废气、废液、废渣，摸清了每种废物成分，然后想尽办法加以处理利用。吉林肥料厂回收放空的二氧化碳气体，一年就能产二万吨碱和八万吨尿素。吉林染料厂利用废液已经制成了硫化碱、氯化酸、炭黑、鞣革剂、氧化锌、碳酸锌等重要产品。为了全面开发和综合利用林区资源，全省十五个森林工业局，到去年底已建立起七十五个制造纤维板和林产化学加工厂。这些土洋结合的小工厂，去年利用枝丫、树皮、锯末、松根、明子、松针等废材，生产了栲胶、纤维板、活性炭、松香、酒精等十五种产品，共八千多吨。现在，各森工局正在加紧兴建六百多处“小土群”，力争年内达到场场（伐木场）有综合利用工厂，厂厂（制材厂和木材加工厂）有综合利用车间。
    吉林省在大闹技术革新和技术革命运动中，已经掌握了以下几条主要经验：（1）技术革新和技术革命运动，既是生产运动也是职工群众自我改造的思想运动。技术革命是思想革命的结果；思想革命推动了技术革命的发展。（2）厂内厂外三结合，全面大协作。运动越是发展，越需要发展“三结合”，越需要组织厂与厂、行业与行业、部门与部门、市与市、地区与地区之间的全面协作；协作范围越广，内容越丰富，力量也就越大。（3）技术革新和技术革命与当前生产和提高企业管理紧密结合，既能保证完成国家计划，又会使企业管理内容得到不断充实和发展，促进生产力高速发展，促进群众运动更大的高涨。（4）从实际出发，两条腿走路。既有手工操作向半机械化和械机化的改革，也有机械化向自动化的改革。同时，把制造高效率简易设备同改造旧有设备结合起来，把局部改革同全面技术改造结合起来；既抓普遍大量存在的问题，也抓高、精、尖、新，既要全面开展，也要重点进行。（5）思想革命、技术革命、文化革命，是相辅相成的，必需互相结合。运动深入发展，劳动组织改变，生产工人相对减少，生产中对工人的要求愈来愈高，要求他们不仅要懂得生产，还要懂得调整、检修机器。这就要工人做到一人多艺，要有更高的文化水平、科学技术知识和更高的政治觉悟，只有这样，才能担任日益复杂的任务。
