	Scattered Red Among Green Trees
	Hong Shu, Zhi Ming, Xing Ya
	What a beautiful and rich treasure land is the Lesser Khingan Mountains! On those undulating mountains, grow dense red pines. The thick trunks stand strong against the wind, fearless, stretching their bold bodies toward the blue sky. Slender little birch trees lean beside them. The pine needles on the crowns are studded with clusters of ripe pine cones. Herds of deer drink spring water from the clear streams flowing from hot springs. In the distance come the shouts of lumberjacks and the roar of power saws. Previously, this was just a logging site, but now the people living here have personally established hundreds of small-scale wood processing factories and forest chemical factories. Now they are advancing with all their strength into the deep mountains, determined to extract more wealth from nature to support the socialist construction of the motherland. It is precisely:
	The Xing’an Mountains stretch endlessly,
	Treasures buried for thousands of years;
	Today we have the General Line,
	Workers emboldened with heroic spirit,
	Vigorously promote "Three-izations, Four Self-Sufficiencies,"
	To order the mountains to offer treasures to serve mankind.
	
	Small Factories, Big Impact
	It was a harsh winter with swirling snowflakes. The whistle of a forest train cut through the silence of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. It was already twilight, and night was falling.
	We arrived in the forest area by covered wagon. Through the snowy curtains of the wagon, we looked into the distant mountain valleys, and saw points of light twinkling. Spring is the busy season for the "Evergreen" and "East Wind" forest farms to engage in comprehensive timber utilization and forest chemical production. In that open basin, surrounded by winding mountain ranges, dozens of wooden and mud-brick houses are mixed together, forming a brand-new small mountain town in the forest area. Smoke rises on the hillsides, and with the sound of the work whistle, workers and their families are busily extracting pine root oil on the steaming factory grounds, placing the broken "mingzi" chunks into large, boiling water pots to extract resin. The motors of the simple processing plants hum rhythmically, and small band saws, circular saws, and cut-off saws rotate rapidly under the drive of a sixty-five-horsepower engine, cutting waste materials – wind-fallen wood and large branches – into useful planks, small squares, box boards, and raw materials for furniture. Even small scraps of wood can find their purpose in the daily-use tool manufacturing workshop. Female workers use small pieces to make exquisite ceiling boxes, axe handles, splints, and children's toys. Such a small, simple processing plant can process more than twenty cubic meters of waste material every day, producing more than ten cubic meters of various useful finished products.
	The "East Wind" and "Evergreen" forest farms, relying on these hardworking people, established more than a dozen forest chemical factories and simple wood processing plants in one year, using waste materials to produce more than ten kinds of products, including: fragrant oil extracted from pine needles; rosin extracted from pine roots; tannin extract from bark; and small-sized timber processed from wind-fallen wood and large branches. In the hands of these daring and determined people who broke into the "forbidden zone" of science, forest trees became priceless treasures, offering everything they should.
	"A drop of dew can reflect the sun," and forest farms like "Evergreen" and "East Wind" are growing and strengthening in the depths of the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains. Now, more than five hundred small-scale wood processing and forest chemical factories are advancing along the general direction of "Three-izations" and "Four Self-Sufficiencies."
	
	Old Workers Build New Factories
	Last winter, in order to rapidly develop the comprehensive utilization of forest farms, the Yidong Wood Processing Factory specially dispatched the old worker and Communist Party member Jiao Zhenduo to the Changqing Forest Farm to help build a factory. Before leaving, the Party General Branch Secretary of the factory repeatedly instructed him: "Old Jiao! This time the organization is transferring you, an old model worker, to support the forest farm. The task is very heavy! Because establishing a wood processing factory in the mountain area is a new initiative in Heilongjiang Province, it is not only of great significance but also encounters many difficulties. But this task can only be done well and must not be ruined!" Old Jiao replied with full confidence: "Please rest assured, a Communist Party member has no difficulties that cannot be overcome. I firmly guarantee the completion of the task assigned to me by the Party."
	In this way, in the severe winter, Old Jiao stepped on the white snow, carrying his luggage roll, and arrived at the Changqing Forest Farm. At that time, the leaders here placed the heavy responsibility of preparing to build a simple wood processing plant on his shoulders. At first, Old Jiao felt somewhat apprehensive seeing such a heavy task. However, when he personally saw the piles of tree branches, tree tops, and wind-fallen wood, left to rot in the harvested forest land, he became motivated. From then on, Old Jiao, relying on his more than twenty years of work experience and a red heart for the cause of the Party, led the women who had just been freed from household chores into the intense factory construction labor. Once, during the installation of the steam engine and band saw, the forest farm lacked cement and could not pour the concrete machine seat, which seriously hindered the progress of the project. At this time, Old Jiao led the workers to hold a Zhuge Liang meeting, mobilizing everyone to discuss and research, and offer suggestions. Finally, they came up with a method of using magnesite, refractory clay, wood, and other materials to replace cement to make a machine seat, which accelerated the progress of the project and improved the quality. The belt pulleys for installing the saws were all made of cast iron, but where could such things be found on a forest farm! So Old Jiao came up with the idea of "replacing iron with wood," using hardwood to make wheels instead of cast iron wheels. Now most of the wheels, axles, levers, and wheel handles used on the factory's machines are made of wood.
	This simple wood processing plant was completed in just one hundred and fifty days with the efforts of Old Jiao and all the employees.
	
	Ordinary Workers Become "Experts"
	In the Dongfeng Forest Farm Chemical Factory, people often see a busy middle-aged man. He wanders through the workshop all day long, never idle, and occasionally rolls up his sleeves to extract pine needle oil with the female workers. His operations are so skilled and rapid. Many workers seek his help when they encounter difficulties in production. His skills enjoy great prestige in the eyes of the workers. This person is Ni Qin, who is known as the "native expert."
	A year ago, Ni Qin was just a preparation worker. The Party's call for vigorously developing the forest chemical industry greatly encouraged him. He had always admired being a forest chemical worker. He bought many pamphlets on forest chemical production, studied them carefully, and conducted various experiments according to the methods in the reference books. Once, after work, he peeled the bark of eight kinds of trees, such as birch and stink pine, and went home to refine them in an iron cooking pot. The first time he did not extract any oil, and the second time he failed again. Later, his wife helped him, and the two of them experimented together, and finally succeeded. He has mastered the refining technology of eight kinds of forest chemical products. Now he is the director of the "Dongfeng" Forest Chemical Factory and also a technician.
	
	Wood Chips Become White Paper
	The Tangwang River has already frozen into a thin layer of ice, the mountain tops are covered with white snow, and the Lesser Khingan Mountains are already draped in white silver. ... But across the thousands of miles on the Haihe River, a strong warmth has blown in.
	The papermaking workshop of the Yidong Forestry Bureau's Wood Processing Factory has been completed! This marks a step forward for the factory from vigorously developing indigenous methods of comprehensive timber utilization to modern production methods. The entire equipment of this papermaking workshop, which has a total area of ​​2,000 square meters, is "modern." The four processes of peeling, engraving, cooking, and papermaking are all mechanized. After the factory is put into production, it will be able to manufacture more than 900 tons of paper and a large amount of pulp from crushed materials such as board skins, strips, small wood, and branches every year. This workshop is now officially put into production. The paper they produce can already be used locally. (Attached picture)

    绿树丛中点点红
    红书　志明　兴亚
    小兴安岭是个多么美丽富饶的宝地！在那迤逦蜿蜒的山岭上，生长着茂密的红松。粗大的树杆迎风劲立，毫无惧色，向蓝蓝的苍空舒伸着慓悍的身躯。苗条的小桦树，依扶在它的身旁。松冠上的针叶镶嵌着一簇簇的成熟了的松塔，河边上的鹿群，从温泉流过的清沟里吸饮着泉水。远处传来伐木者的喊声和机锯轰鸣。以前，这里还仅仅是个伐木场，现在生活在这里的人们已经亲手办起了数百个小型木材加工厂、林产化工厂。现在他们全力向深山进军，决心向大自然索取更多的财富，支援祖国社会主义建设。这正是：
    兴安峻岭长绵绵，
    宝藏埋没上千年；
    今朝有了总路线，
    壮起工人英雄胆，
    大搞“三化、四自给”，
    令山献宝奉人间。
    工厂小作用大
    这是一个飘洒着雪花的严冬。一列森林火车的汽笛声划破了小兴安岭的寂静。这时已经是暮色茫茫，夜幕降临了。
    我们乘着棚车来到林区。透过棚车上的雪帘，往远处的山坳里望去，点点莹光在跳动。春天，正是
  “长青”和“东风”两个林场大搞木材综合利用和林化生产繁忙的季节，在那一片开阔的盆地上，四周紧围着蜿蜒的山群。数十处木板房，泥草房参杂在一起，构成了一个崭新的林区小山城。山坡上烟雾升腾，随着上班的汽笛声，职工和家属们在热气蒸腾地提炼松根油的厂地上，把破碎了的“明子”块，放在热水翻滚的大锅里提炼松脂。简易加工厂的马达声有节奏地鸣叫着，小带锯、元锯、截锯等在一个六十五马力的动力机带动下，飞速地旋转着。把废料——风倒木、大枝丫制割成有用的板材、小方、箱板材和做家具的原料。碎小的木料在日用工具制造车间也能找到它的归宿。女工们用小料制出了精致的天棚盒、斧把、马夹板和儿童玩具。这样一个小型的简易加工厂，每天加工二十多立方米废材，制出各种有用的成材十立方米以上。
    “东风”和“长青”林场，就是依靠这些勤劳的人，在一年的时间里办起了十几座林产化学工厂和木材简易加工厂，用废料生产出十多种产品，其中有：用松针提炼的芳香油；用松根提炼的松香；用树皮炼的栲胶；用风倒木、大枝枒加工出的小规格材。林木，在这些敢想敢干闯入科学“禁地”的人们手下，变成了无价之宝，献出了它应当献出的一切。
    “一滴露珠可见太阳”，像“长青”“东风”这样的林场，在小兴安岭和完达山丛林的深处，已经日益成长壮大起来了。现在有五百多座小型的木材加工和林产化学工厂正沿着“三化”“四自给”的总方向迈进。
    老工人建新厂
    去年冬天，为了迅速发展林场的综合利用，伊东木材加工厂，特派了老工人、共产党员矫振铎去长青林场帮助建厂。临行前，工厂的党总支书记，一再嘱咐他说：“老矫！这次组织上把你这个老模范调出去支援林场，任务很重啊！因为在山场建立木材加工厂是黑龙江省一个新的创举，不仅意义重大而且碰到的困难也会很多，但是这个任务只能搞好，千万不能搞坏啊！”老矫充满信心地回答说：“请放心，一个共产党员没有克服不了的困难。党交给我的任务，我坚决保证完成。”
    就这样，在严寒的冬季里，老矫踏着白雪扛着行李卷来到了长青林场。当时这里的领导就把筹建木材简易加工厂的重担放在他的身上。开始，老矫看到这么繁重的任务，有些耽心。但是，当他亲眼看到采伐过的林地上，一堆堆树枝丫、树头、风倒木，白白任其腐烂的情形，干劲就来了。从此老矫就凭借着二十多年的工作经验和对党的事业的一颗红心，率领着刚刚脱开家务的妇女们投入了紧张的建厂劳动。一次在安装蒸汽机和带锯时，林厂没有水泥不能浇灌混凝土机坐台，严重地阻碍着工程进度。这时老矫就领导工人开诸葛亮会，动员大家讨论研究，献方献策，终于想出了用菱苦土、耐火土、木材等代替水泥，制成了机座台，加快了工程进度，质量很好。安装锯的皮带轮都是铸铁的，但是一个林场上哪能找到这种东西呢！于是老矫又想出“以木代铁”办法，用硬木制成轮子代替铸铁轮。现在这个工厂机器上所用的轮、轴杠、轮柄等，绝大部分都是木制的。
    这个简易木材加工厂，在老矫和全体职工的努力下，仅用一百五十天的时间就建成了。
    普通工人变“专家”
    在东风林场化工厂里，人们经常会看到一个繁忙的中年人。他每天一刻也不闲地在车间穿来穿去，不时地还挽起袖子和女工们一起提炼松针香油。他的操作是那么熟炼而又迅速。许多工人在生产中遇到困难就找他帮助解决。他的技术在工人们的眼里享有极大的威信。这个人就是被人们称为“土专家”的倪勤。
    一年前，倪勤还是个准备作业工人。党的大搞林产化学工业的号召，对他鼓舞很大。他过去就非常羡慕当一名林化工人。他自己买了许多有关林化生产的小册子，认真学习，按参考书上的做法进行各种试验。有一次下班后，他扒下了白桦臭松等八种树皮，回到家里用煮饭铁锅进行炼制。第一次没有炼出油来，第二次又失败了。以后他的爱人帮他，两人一起试验，终于成功了。他已经掌握了八种林产化学产品的炼制技术，现在他是“东风”林产化学工厂的厂长，又是技术员。
    碎木变白纸
    汤旺河上已结成一层薄冰，山头上白雪皑皑，小兴安岭已经披裹上白色的银装。……但是在那相隔千里的海河边上却吹来了浓厚的暖意。
    伊东林业局木材加工厂造纸车间落成了！这标志着这个厂在大搞土法木材综合利用的基础上，向洋法生产迈进了一步。这个总面积为二千平方米的造纸车间，整个设备都是“洋”的，在剥片、刻料、蒸煮、抄纸四道工序都是机械化操作。工厂投入生产后，每年用板皮、板条、小木头、枝丫等碎料，能够制造出九百多吨纸张和大量纸浆。现在这个车间已经正式投入生产了。他们生产的纸张已能供当地使用。（附图片）
