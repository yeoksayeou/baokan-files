　　Growing Wings, Riding a Steed
　　Yang Xuan
　　Pomegranate flowers bloom red and bright, women hold up half the sky;
　　If anything is done without women, how can we conquer heaven?
　　Such folk songs could only be an ideal in the past, but now they have become a complete reality. The founding of New China ended the history of oppression and enslavement of our women for thousands of years; the rapid development of the motherland has enabled more and more sisters to hold their heads high and step onto various posts of socialist construction.
　　And today, how can we restrain our excited feelings and not dedicate the most beautiful ode to the Party's General Line, to the Great Leap Forward, and to the People's Communes? It is these three magic weapons that have enabled more sisters, especially rural sisters, to get rid of the burden of housework, ending the days of "endless work at the stove, endless washing at the water's edge, getting up early, eating late, being busy and dizzy, and still being scolded." The revolutionary teacher Lenin once said: "If women are busy with housework, their status is always inevitably limited..." and predicted: "Only where petty, individual housework is replaced completely by socialized large-scale economy will there be real emancipation of women, real communism."
　　Lenin's prediction is beginning to be realized in today's China. People's Communes and urban streets have universally established public canteens, nurseries, sewing and washing groups, service stations and other collective welfare undertakings, turning tedious housework into social collective labor, which has opened up the broadest world for the vast number of urban and rural sisters to participate in socialist construction.
　　The long-cherished dream of Chinese women has been realized, and the blood and sweat shed by our mothers and grandmothers for generations of struggle have blossomed and borne fruit. However, when we look back now, how far the goals they pursued and struggled for are from our reality! The path our sisters are taking now has far exceeded what our predecessors could have imagined. They only knew to demand to get rid of housework and go to society, but did not know where to go; they only knew to demand equality between men and women, but did not understand what the true meaning of equality between men and women was. But we all understand!
　　We understand: Getting rid of the shackles of housework and participating in social labor is only the starting point, not the end, of our women's complete liberation. We are far-sighted, and now we contribute the greatest strength to the socialist construction of the motherland, and in the future, we will also promote the giant wheel of the times to advance rapidly towards the goal of communism, until the liberation of all mankind. Only then will our women truly achieve the most complete liberation.
　　We also understand: True equality between men and women is by no means the set of forms used by the bourgeoisie to deceive the world, but requires our women to establish great ambitions, sweep away all ideological residues such as inferiority, dependence, and narrow-mindedness, and strive to move forward bravely and unyieldingly on the construction front together with male comrades. What male comrades can do, we can also do; what male comrades do well, we can also do well.
　　Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we not only understand these principles, but we are already putting them into practice.
　　Look, in the cities and villages of the motherland, the red flags are like a sea, and there are so many heroines in it! How many touching and inspiring deeds have appeared! How many red, diligent, skillful, and thrifty masters and advanced collectives have emerged! In the past, we used to win people's sympathy and pity with tears, but now we gain people's trust and respect with excellent labor. The communist ideology, style, and spiritual outlook have taken root in our vast number of sisters and are rapidly growing and expanding their influence; the shortcomings and residues left to us by the old era are rapidly fading from us.
　　We wholeheartedly thank the Party, thank our great leader Chairman Mao! It is the Party, it is Chairman Mao, who led us on the road to complete liberation, giving us wings to fly freely in the sky of the motherland, and enabling us to ride on steeds, galloping freely on the socialist road. Look, on the eve of "March 8th" International Women's Day, good news keeps pouring in, and how many advanced sisters are using their own labor achievements, their own noble communist style, their own great ambitions, and their own red and expert determination to answer the expectations of the Party and the people, adding infinite spring to the blooming garden of the motherland. They are our good examples, let us pick up our colored pens and write more, better, and more beautiful poems!

### 长上翅膀，跨上骏马

    长上翅膀，跨上骏马
    杨萱
    石榴花开红艳艳，妇女占了半边天；
    凡百事情没妇女，哪里能够战胜天？
    这样的民歌，在过去只能是空想，现在，却完全成为现实了。新中国的成立，结束了我们妇女几千年来受压迫被奴役的历史；祖国一日千里的飞跃发展，使越来越多的姐妹们能够昂着头踏上社会主义建设的各个岗位。
    而在今天，我们又怎能遏制住激动的心情，不把最美的颂歌献给党的总路线、献给大跃进、献给人民公社呢？正是这三件法宝，使更多的姐妹、特别是农村姐妹摆脱了家务的牵累，结束了整天整月“做不完的灶前头，洗不完的水桥头，起身在前头，吃饭在后头，忙得昏头，还要吃排头”的日子。革命导师列宁早就说过：“妇女要是忙于家务，她们的地位总不免要受到限制……。”并且预言：“只有在开始把琐碎的家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”
    列宁的预言，在今天的中国开始实现了。人民公社和城市街道普遍办起了公共食堂、托儿所、缝洗组、服务站等集体福利事业，把繁琐的家务变成为社会集体劳动，这就给广大城乡姐妹参加社会主义建设开辟了最广阔的天地。
    我国妇女梦寐以求的梦想实现了，我们母亲、祖母几辈为之斗争不息所流的血汗开花结果了。然而，我们现在回头看一看，她们要追求和奋斗的目标，距离我们的现实又是多么遥远啊！我们姐妹们现时所走的路，早已远远超出我们的前辈们所能够想像的地步了。她们只知道要求摆脱家务走上社会，不知道走到哪儿去；她们只知道要求男女平等，却也不懂得男女平等的真正含义是什么。而我们都懂得！
    我们懂得：摆脱家务束缚、参加社会劳动只是我们妇女彻底解放的起点，而不是尽头。我们高瞻远瞩，现在为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献出最大的力量，以后还要推动时代的巨轮飞速向共产主义的目标前进，直到全人类的解放。到那时，我们妇女才真正得到最彻底的解放。
    我们也懂得：真正的男女平等，决不是资产阶级用来骗人盗世的那一套形式，而是要求我们妇女树雄心、立大志，扫清一切自卑、依赖、狭隘等思想残余，在建设战线上做到和男同志们一道勇猛向前，百折不挠。男同志们能干的，我们也能干；男同志们干得好的，我们也能干得好。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们不仅懂得这些道理，而且早已在实践着了。
    你看，在祖国的城市和乡村，红旗似海，这里面有多少女英雄！出现了多少可歌可泣的动人事迹！涌现了多少红、勤、巧、俭的能手和先进集体！从前，我们曾以眼泪赢得人们的同情和怜悯，现在我们却以出色的劳动获得人们的信任和尊重。共产主义的思想风格、精神面貌已在我们广大姐妹身上扎了根，正在迅速成长和扩大影响；旧时代遗留给我们的缺点残余正在迅速地从我们身上消褪。
    我们衷心地感谢党，感谢我们的伟大领袖毛主席！是党，是毛主席，领着我们走上彻底解放的道路，使我们长上了翅膀，在祖国的天空自由飞翔，使我们跨上了骏马，在社会主义大道上纵情驰骋。你看，在“三八”前夕，捷报频传，又是多少先进的姊妹们用自己的劳动成果，用自己崇高的共产主义风格，用自己的雄心大志，用自己的红透专深的决心，来回答党和人民的期望，在祖国的百花盛开的大花园里增添无限春色。她们是我们的好榜样，让我们拿起彩笔，写出更多更好更美的诗篇吧！
