    "Must Move Jishan to Tao'an"
    (Reported by this newspaper) Encouraged by the slogan "Launch a major sanitation campaign to catch up with Jishan, and be sure to move Jishan to Tao'an," members of the people's communes in Tao'an County, Jilin Province, combined the campaign with the spring plowing production centered on accumulating manure. Braving the severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius, they overcame the difficulties of freezing temperatures and launched a major campaign to address the root causes of unsanitary conditions. In just one month, they renovated more than 9,000 toilets and cleared more than 3.8 million tons of garbage and livestock pen waste.
    On the basis of basically completing water conservancy construction, Tao'an County launched a major sanitation infrastructure construction and fundamental improvement work, and launched a concentrated effort to transport garbage and manure. On January 30, the Party committee secretaries and administrative leaders of all organs and units in the county personally led the masses to clear garbage and manure. The people's communes also adopted a combination of professional manure accumulation teams and mass movements, organizing more than 23,000 laborers to form 296 professional sanitation and manure accumulation teams to clear garbage and manure, and established 745 large-scale harmless manure factories and 82 artificial fertilizer factories.
    In order to send the manure and garbage in the villages and towns out before the thaw to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, the county launched a manure delivery campaign on the basis of sanitation and manure accumulation. Yongmao Commune promoted the method of transporting manure using ice road sleds. In just half a month, 56 sleds transported more than 30,000 tons of garbage.
    In the concentrated manure delivery campaign, all communes adopted the method of piling the manure in large piles in the fields and then breaking it down into smaller piles to ensure fertilizer efficiency and eliminate breeding conditions for mosquitoes and flies. According to statistics on February 10, the county had already delivered more than 1.2 million tons of manure to the fields. At present, they are continuing their efforts, striving to deliver all the manure to the fields before the thaw, completely eliminate the breeding nests of mosquitoes and flies, and support spring plowing production.

    “定要稷山移洮安”
    本报讯　吉林洮安县各人民公社社员，在“大搞卫生赶稷山，定要稷山移洮安”的口号鼓舞下，结合以积肥为中心的备耕生产，冒着零下三十度严寒，克服了天寒地冻的困难，大搞治本，仅一个月时间，整修厕所九千多个，清除垃圾、畜圈污土三百八十多万吨。
    洮安县在基本结束水利建设的基础上，大搞卫生基本建设和治本工作，突击运出垃圾粪便。1月30日，全县各机关、单位党委书记、行政领导干部，亲自带领广大群众，清除垃圾粪便。各人民公社也采取专业积肥队与群众运动相结合的办法，组织了二万三千多名劳动力，组成二百九十六个专业卫生积肥队，清除垃圾粪便，并开办了大粪无害化厂七百四十五处，人造化肥厂八十二处。
    为了在解冻前将村屯中粪便垃圾送出去，消灭蚊蝇孳生地，该县在卫生积肥的基础上，又开展了送肥运动。永茂公社推行了冰道爬犁运输方法，仅半个月时间五十六台爬犁送出垃圾三万多吨。
    各公社在突击送肥运动中，都采取了地里扒大堆，捣细成小堆的办法，既保证了肥效，又消灭了蚊蝇孳生条件。到2月10日统计，全县已送出一百二十多万吨粪肥上地。目前，他们正再接再厉，争取在化冻前，把全部粪肥送下地，彻底消灭蚊蝇孳生老窝，支援春耕生产。（附图片）
