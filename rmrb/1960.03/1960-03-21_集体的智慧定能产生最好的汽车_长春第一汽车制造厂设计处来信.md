    Collective Wisdom Will Produce the Best Cars
    ——Letter from the Design Office of Changchun First Automobile Works

To the Editor:

    Since the publication of the letter "Concern for Our Common Cause" in the letters column on page two of the People's Daily on February 8th, soliciting opinions on the improved design of the Jiefang (Liberation) truck, we have received 163 letters from people across the country by March 2nd, offering more than 1,100 suggestions, some with detailed drawings.
    These enthusiastic letters fully express the concern of the broad masses of people for the country's automobile production. Liu Zhexue, an old worker in Andong City with more than 20 years of experience driving and repairing cars, wrote: I was extremely happy to see your letter soliciting opinions on the improved design of the "Jiefang" truck. I sincerely hope that our cars can quickly catch up with and surpass the advanced levels in the world. He enclosed five suggestions for improving the "Jiefang" truck with his letter. Master Chen Houlu, who was on a business trip from Jinan to Zhangjiakou, wrote a long letter the same night after seeing the letter soliciting opinions on the Jiefang truck, offering 38 suggestions and expressing his intention to discuss it with his colleagues after returning to Jinan to offer more suggestions. Soldiers from the Motor Transport Department of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, far away on the border, also organized a discussion and wrote down their opinions.
    These letters have been of great help to us. First, they summarized a lot of complete data based on actual use and repair experience, providing a reliable basis for new car selection and improvement. For example, someone suggested putting the toolbox inside the foot pedal, so that the tools can be taken out as soon as you get out of the car, which is very convenient, and how to better ventilate the cab, etc. Second, they reflected some urgent problems in the world's various automobiles that have never been solved. For example, the headlights can turn with the car, and there should be a weight meter on the car, etc., which fully demonstrates the daring and capable style of the Chinese working class and provides many new methods for the improved design of new cars that cannot be found in books or elsewhere. Many other suggestions reflected the specific situation and problems of automobiles in various regions, providing a basis for the further adaptation of the Jiefang truck to the characteristics of the region. These letters not only increased our knowledge, but also strengthened our confidence in further climbing the peak of automobile advanced design technology.
    We will carefully analyze and study these valuable opinions, and submit them to the "three-way combination" mass selection meeting inside and outside the factory for discussion and decision-making after sorting them out. Recently, we have organized discussions with the Changchun City automobile transportation and repair departments, relevant schools, research departments, and production workers. We also plan to invite comrades from the transportation departments to discuss it again, and finally revise the final plan.
    In order to regularize the solicitation of opinions from the general public to participate in improving product design, we have formulated a series of letter handling systems, stipulating that designated personnel in each level of the organization are responsible, and establishing a complete file system and inspection system. We are also preparing to hire some off-site experts with rich experience in automobile manufacturing and repair as special designers of our factory's design office, and maintain long-term and regular contact with them.
    Finally, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the comrades who took the time to write letters from all over the country. We warmly hope that you will continue to give us your opinions and keep in touch with us in the future.

### 集体的智慧定能产生最好的汽车——长春第一汽车制造厂设计处来信

    集体的智慧定能产生最好的汽车
    ——长春第一汽车制造厂设计处来信编辑同志：
    自从2月8日人民日报二版“关心我们共同的事业”来信专栏中刊登了关于解放牌汽车改进设计征求意见的信以后，到3月2日止，我们已收到了全国各地群众的来信一百六十三封，共提出一千一百多条建议，有的还附有详细图纸。
    这些热情洋溢的信充分表达了广大人民群众对祖国汽车生产的关心。安东市一位有二十多年驾驶和修理汽车经验的老工人刘哲学来信说：看到你们征求“解放牌”汽车改进设计的信，我万分高兴。我真希望我们的汽车能够很快赶上和超过世界上先进水平。他随信寄来了五项改进“解放牌”汽车的意见。从济南出差到张家口的陈厚禄老师傅，看到解放牌汽车征求意见的信以后，当天就连夜写了一封长信，提出了三十八条意见，并表示回济南以后，还要和同行研究一下，提出更多的建议。远在边界的新疆军区建设兵团机运处的战士们也组织了座谈，写来了他们的意见。
    这些来信对我们的帮助很大。第一，他们根据实际使用情况及修理经验，总结出了不少完整的资料，为新车选型和改进提供了可靠的根据。例如有人提出把工具箱放在脚踏板里面，一下车就可拿出工具，非常方便，还有驾驶室如何才能更好通风等等。第二，反映了世界上各种汽车从未解决的一些迫切要求解决的问题。如前大灯能随汽车转弯而一起转动，汽车上应有重量计等，充分的表现了我国工人阶级敢想敢干的风格，为新车改进设计提供了很多书本上和其他地方见不到的新办法。还有很多建议反映了各个地区汽车的具体情况和问题，为解放牌汽车进一步适应于地区的特点，提供了根据。这些来信，不但使我们增加了许多知识，也加强了我们进一步攀登汽车尖端设计技术的信心。
    对于这些宝贵的意见，我们将认真地分析研究，整理后提交厂内外“三结合”群众选型大会讨论抉择。最近，我们已经组织长春市汽车运输修理部门、有关学校、研究部门和生产工人进行了讨论。我们还准备邀请一些交通运输部门的同志再讨论一次，最后修正定案。
    为了把征求广大群众参加改进产品设计经常化起来，我们已经定出了一系列的来信处理制度，规定各级组织中指定专人负责，建立完整的档案制度和检查制度。我们还准备聘请一些在汽车制造和修理方面有丰富经验的厂外行家作为我厂设计处特约设计员，和他们保持长期的经常的联系。
    最后，我们向各地在百忙中写信来的同志表示衷心的感谢。我们热烈地希望你们今后仍旧不断给我们提意见，经常和我们联系。
