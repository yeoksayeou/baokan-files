Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 22nd: Warsaw newspapers today published the joint statement of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, the Polish government delegation, and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government delegation. The statement said that during the visit of the Hungarian Party and government delegation to Poland, the two sides held talks in a friendly atmosphere of complete mutual understanding. The two sides exchanged views on international issues and issues in the international workers' movement of common interest, and discussed the prospects and tasks for further developing cooperation between Poland and Hungary and between the two parties. Both sides noted with satisfaction that the two sides held completely identical views on all issues discussed.

The joint statement said that both sides emphasized in the talks the great significance of further developing and consolidating the unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance of the socialist camp. Both sides believe that the unity of the socialist camp, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, is the foundation of the material and moral strength of the socialist camp, the fundamental prerequisite for the success and victory of the socialist system, and a reliable guarantee for safeguarding the interests of every socialist country. The statement pointed out that both sides will do everything possible to promote the unity of the socialist camp and raise the cooperation between socialist countries to a higher level.

The statement said: The balance of power on the international stage has undergone a fundamental change in favor of socialism and peace. This has been facilitated by the Soviet Union's epoch-making victories in the cause of communist construction and in the fields of economy, technology and science, as well as the great achievements of other socialist countries. The development process of socialist camp countries is increasingly influencing the international situation. The unity and strength of the socialist camp have bankrupted the imperialist policy of strength. The peaceful policies of socialist countries are now gaining more understanding and support.

The statement said that Poland and Hungary welcome with satisfaction the positive changes that have occurred in international relations. Both sides reiterated their complete agreement with the assessment of the international situation and the demands put forward in the declaration of the Warsaw Treaty member states on February 4 this year.

The statement said that Poland and Hungary, together with other socialist countries, expressed their full support for the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and believe that the Soviet government's decision to substantially reduce its armed forces is a constructive contribution to the cause of disarmament. Both sides hope that the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will achieve good results.

Both sides welcomed the upcoming high-level talks and hoped that the participants would resolve pressing international issues in accordance with the expectations of peace-loving people around the world.

Both sides pointed out that the forces of the Cold War are still continuing their actions. The militaristic and revanchist forces of West Germany are a particular danger to peace in Europe and the world. Both sides believe that the security and stability of Europe require a solution to the German question: the conclusion of peace treaties with both Germanies and the resolution of the West Berlin issue. The statement said that if the resolution of these pressing issues continues to be delayed in the future, Poland and Hungary will have no choice but to sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

In the statement, the Hungarian People's Republic reiterated its firm belief that the Oder-Neisse line is inviolable. It is a line of peace, and any attempt to undermine this line would be a violation of peace.

Regarding the relations between Poland and Hungary, both sides confirmed that political, economic and cultural relations between the two countries are developing smoothly. The statement said that the visit of the Hungarian Party and government delegation to Poland marks a new and important stage in the further development of the traditional friendship and relations between the two fraternal peoples. Both sides are deeply convinced that this visit will also help consolidate the unity of the socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 22nd: During the visit of the Hungarian Party and government delegation to Poland, Poland and Hungary signed a long-term trade agreement for 1961-1965. The agreement stipulates that by 1965, the trade volume between the two countries will increase by 110% compared with 1960.

The agreement stipulates that during the five years from 1961 to 1965, the trade volume between Poland and Hungary will reach two billion zlotys (Polish currency). During this period, Poland will provide Hungary with lathes, six thousand freight train cars and tank cars, eight thousand cars and small buses, as well as complete sets of equipment for cement plants and sulfuric acid plants, mining equipment, textile machinery, etc. Hungary will supply Poland with chemical industry and food industry equipment, locomotives, buses, etc.

    两国签订新的五年贸易协定
    新华社华沙22日电　华沙各报今天刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会、波兰政府代表团和匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会、匈牙利工农革命政府代表团的联合声明。声明中说，在匈牙利党政代表团访问波兰期间，双方在友好和完全相互谅解的气氛中进行了会谈，双方就共同感兴趣的国际问题和国际工人运动中的问题交换了意见，并且讨论了波匈两国和两党进一步发展合作的前景和任务。双方满意地指出，在所有讨论的问题上双方的意见完全一致。
    联合声明说，双方在会谈中强调指出了进一步发展和巩固社会主义阵营的团结、合作和互助的巨大意义。双方认为，奠基在无产阶级国际主义原则上的社会主义阵营的团结，是社会主义阵营物质上和道义上强大的基础，是社会主义体系成功和胜利的根本前提，是保卫每一个社会主义国家的利益的可靠保障。声明指出，双方将尽一切可能，来促进社会主义阵营的团结，把社会主义国家的合作提到更高的水平。
    声明中说：国际舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义和和平的根本变化。苏联在共产主义建设事业，在经济、技术科学方面划时代的胜利，以及其它社会主义国家的巨大成就促成了这一点。社会主义阵营各国的发展进程日益影响着国际局势。社会主义阵营国家的团结和力量使帝国主义的实力地位政策破产。社会主义国家的和平政策现在获得了更多的了解和支持。
    声明说，波、匈两国满意地欢迎在国际关系中出现的良好变化。双方再次重申，完全同意今年2月4日华沙条约缔约国宣言对国际局势所作的估计以及所提出的要求。
    声明说，波、匈两国同其它社会主义国家一道，表示完全支持苏联关于全面彻底裁军的建议，并且认为，苏联政府关于大量裁减武装部队的决定是对裁军事业的建设性贡献。双方希望，十国裁军委员会的工作将能获得良好的结果。
    双方表示欢迎即将举行的高级会谈，并且希望会谈参加者将根据全世界爱好和平人民的期望解决刻不容缓的国际问题。
    双方指出，目前冷战势力仍在继续行动。西德的军国主义和复仇主义的力量是欧洲和全世界和平的特别的危险。双方认为，欧洲的安全和稳定要求解决德国问题：同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题。声明说，如果今后继续拖延这些刻不容缓的问题的解决，波匈两国将不得不同德意志民主共和国签订和约。
    匈牙利人民共和国在声明中再次表示，它坚信奥得—尼斯分界线是不可动摇的。这是一条和平的分界线，妄想破坏这条分界线的任何企图，都将是对和平的侵犯。
    关于波匈两国的关系问题，双方确认，两国间的政治、经济和文化关系正在顺利发展。声明说，匈牙利党政代表团对波兰的访问标志着两国兄弟人民的传统友谊和关系进一步发展的新的、重要的阶段。双方深信，这次访问也将有助于巩固社会主义阵营的团结。
    新华社华沙22日电　在匈牙利党政代表团访问波兰期间，波匈两国签订了1961—1965年长期贸易协定。协定规定，到1965年，两国的贸易额将比1960年增加110％。
    协定中规定，在1961—1965年五年间，波匈两国的贸易额将达二十亿兹罗提（波币名）。在这期间，波兰将向匈牙利提供车床，六千辆货车车厢和油槽车，八千辆小轿车和小型公共汽车，以及水泥厂和硫酸厂的全套设备、矿山设备、纺织机器等。匈牙利将供应波兰化学工业和食品工业设备、机车、公共汽车等。
