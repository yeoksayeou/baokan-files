Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th: The Zhuxiandong Reservoir in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, officially began supplying fresh water to Macao compatriots for drinking on March 8th.

The Zhuxiandong Reservoir and Yinkeng Reservoir in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, adjacent to Macao, were built two years ago at the request of Macao compatriots to help them solve the long-term difficulty of insufficient drinking water. The Zhuxiandong Reservoir project was completed during the Spring Festival this year and preparations were made for water supply. The main structure of the Yinkeng Reservoir has also been completed, and the water conveyance channel is currently being rushed. On March 7th, representatives from all walks of life in Macao, including Ho Yin and Ma Man-kei, went to Zhongshan County to request an early water supply. The Party and government of Zhongshan County accepted the request of the Macao compatriots and decided to supply water to Macao compatriots for drinking on March 8th.

Recently, the Macao region has been suffering from a prolonged drought, and residents are facing the threat of water shortages. The early supply of fresh water for drinking from the Zhuxiandong Reservoir to Macao has been met with great gratitude from all walks of life in Macao. Choi Tak-kui, vice chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: At a time when Macao is experiencing difficulties with drinking water, the motherland has promptly helped us solve our difficulties. We are deeply moved by the motherland's profound kindness. Li Kwai, vice chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, said: The motherland's water supply to Macao has relieved Macao compatriots from the threat of water shortages. When drinking water, remember its source. Macao compatriots should love the motherland even more.
