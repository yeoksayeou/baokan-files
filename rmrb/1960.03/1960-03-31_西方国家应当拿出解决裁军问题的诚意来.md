    Western Countries Should Show Sincerity in Solving the Disarmament Problem
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference between the East and West has been held for half a month since it began on March 15. This international disarmament conference, which had been interrupted for two years, was able to reconvene this time, and the United States and other Western countries had solemnly expressed their willingness to solve the disarmament problem beforehand. Therefore, peace-loving people of all countries have placed their hopes on this conference. However, the progress of the conference over the past half month shows that although the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have made great efforts to seek a solution to the disarmament problem, the Western countries, led by the United States, have no sincerity at all. They have been using schemes that actually hinder the solution of the disarmament problem to delay the process and create obstacles. Therefore, the conference has not yet made significant progress.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet delegation proposed a plan for complete and thorough disarmament from the very beginning. This plan is based on the disarmament proposal put forward by Comrade Khrushchev to the United Nations General Assembly in September last year. This plan stipulates that within four years, complete and thorough disarmament of all countries in the world will be achieved in three stages through massive reductions and even complete abolition of the armed forces and conventional armaments of various countries, the withdrawal of all military bases on foreign territories, and the complete destruction of various nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. This proposal fully embodies the peace aspirations of the people of all countries and fully conforms to their vital interests. It is so reasonable and feasible that it has won widespread support from fair-minded public opinion in various countries.

    If Western countries are truly willing to solve the disarmament problem, then they should conduct discussions on the basis of the Soviet disarmament proposal. However, the actions of Western countries are completely contrary to the requirements of disarmament. They successively put forward the so-called three-stage disarmament plan and the ten-point supervision plan at the meetings on the 16th and 28th. The Western plan completely avoids discussing the goals, measures, and time limits of complete and thorough disarmament, the issue of prohibiting the production, use, and testing of nuclear weapons, and even more so, the issue of withdrawing military bases on foreign territories. These plans are almost entirely focused on the issue of supervision. And the "supervision" they advocate is merely to allow Western countries to obtain the opportunity to openly collect military intelligence of socialist countries. It has nothing in common with the true purpose of promoting disarmament. If the Western plan is analyzed, it can be seen that, in essence, what Western countries are asking for in the first stage is to collect a large amount of important intelligence, including information on troops, armaments, and military expenditures; the second stage is to go to other countries for on-the-spot reconnaissance; and the third stage is to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries through the so-called "international police force." This plan also particularly emphasizes obtaining intelligence materials on missile bases and space device programs. Considering the fact that the United States is desperately developing missiles and space weapons to shorten the "gap" in this area where it lags far behind the Soviet Union, it is not difficult for people to understand what the true intentions of Western countries are. Although the Western countries also stipulated the limit of the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union in their own plan, which seems like a disarmament measure, the absurdity lies here. Because in order to "realize" such a "disarmament" plan in the first stage, the United States needs to expand its army by another 9,965 people! No wonder the American "Stone Weekly" also believes that this is completely "cunning and obvious… deception."

    Now the disarmament conference is discussing the issue of disarmament and supervision. The representatives of socialist countries advocate that the focus of the conference should first be on discussing disarmament measures, while Western countries insist that resolving the issue of "supervision" is a prerequisite for resolving the disarmament problem. In the relationship between disarmament and supervision, which should be the priority is very clear. Disarmament is the goal, and supervision is only a means to achieve this goal. If agreements are not first sought and reached on disarmament measures, what is the meaning of discussing and resolving the supervision issue? Attempting to place the supervision issue above the disarmament issue, or even making the latter dependent on the former, is a completely misguided approach, the essence of which is to hinder the solution of the disarmament problem. What the Soviet Union and other socialist countries advocate is disarmament with supervision, while what the United States and Western countries advocate is supervision without disarmament. Isn't it very clear who sincerely wants disarmament and who is doing their best to hinder the realization of disarmament?

    Regarding this point, the situation of the Soviet, American, and British tripartite conference on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, which is currently being held in Geneva, also provides convincing collateral evidence. At this conference, the Soviet representative recently put forward an important proposal, advocating that the conference conclude an agreement agreeing to stop all nuclear weapon tests, including tests in the atmosphere, oceans, and outer space, as well as underground tests that generate a seismic index above 4.75. This is a major effort made by the Soviet Union to break the deadlock in the conference, because the United States has always refused to conclude an agreement to stop underground nuclear tests with a seismic magnitude below 4.75. However, when the Soviet Union agreed to the original proposition of the United States, the United States itself retreated. US Deputy Secretary of Defense James Douglas even said that accepting the Soviet proposal was "contrary to our (American) position" because the US military hoped to continue testing lightweight nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is very clear that although the United States says verbally that it is willing to disarm and stop nuclear tests, it is actually doing its best to hinder the realization of disarmament and refuses to stop testing nuclear weapons.

    Everyone can see that while the United States is engaging in empty talk about disarmament at the East-West disarmament conference, it is continuing to intensify its activities to expand its armaments and prepare for war. US military authorities recently announced that they will allocate huge amounts of funds to accelerate the development of "Atlas" intercontinental missiles and "Polaris" missile submarines. The Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army, US General Norstad, also announced the establishment of a so-called "multinational mobile special force" with nuclear weapons. Many military and political leaders in the United States are continuing to advocate strengthening the so-called "deterrent force," attempting to salvage the "position of strength" that the United States has already bankrupted. Earlier this year, US President Eisenhower had said: "...While negotiating on the issue of disarmament, we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness." US Vice President Nixon also said: "Under no circumstances should the United States and its allies reduce their troops." Britain and France are also continuing to follow the United States in increasing military spending, expanding armaments, and stepping up the development of nuclear weapons. As for West Germany, it is even more arrogantly and openly demanding to obtain foreign military bases, fully exposing its fierce ambition to pursue expansion and aggression. Therefore, some Western newspapers have revealed that the representatives of Western countries are prepared to conduct endless negotiations at the disarmament conference, which is not a baseless conjecture. The American "New York Herald Tribune" once wrote that the Western representatives went to Geneva with the clear intention of conducting very long-term negotiations. The British "Observer" also pointed out that "the Western delegation in Geneva will be prepared to conduct slow and long-term negotiations, just like the conference on the non-continuation of nuclear tests that has continued for seventeen months so far." Therefore, people have reason to suspect that the United States and some Western countries actually want to use the disarmament conference as a smokescreen for their military expansion.

    The Chinese people have consistently advocated the implementation of universal disarmament and actively support the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. Our people and our government have demonstrated their sincere desire to maintain peace and achieve disarmament with practical actions in the past. As Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country said, "In the future, our government and people will, together with our great ally the Soviet Union and all other peace-loving countries and people, spare no effort to fight unremittingly for universal disarmament and the defense of world peace." Our people, like the people of other countries, are closely watching the development of the disarmament conference and demanding that Western countries show sincerity in solving the disarmament problem.

### 西方国家应当拿出解决裁军问题的诚意来

    西方国家应当拿出解决裁军问题的诚意来
    本报评论员
    东西方十国裁军会议自从3月15日开始以来已举行半个月了。曾经中断了二年之久的国际裁军会议这次得以重新召开，而且美国和其他西方国家事前又曾郑重其事地表示愿意解决裁军问题，因此各国爱好和平的人民对于这一次会议是寄予希望的。但是会议半个月来的进程表明，尽管苏联和其他社会主义国家为了谋求裁军问题的解决，作了很大的努力，以美国为首的西方国家却毫无诚意，一直拿一些实际上是阻挠解决裁军问题的方案来拖延时日，制造障碍，因而会议至今还未能取得显著的进展。
    大家知道，苏联代表团从一开始就提出了全面彻底裁军的方案。这个方案是以赫鲁晓夫同志去年9月间向联合国大会提出的裁军建议为蓝本的。这个方案规定，在四年之内，通过大量裁减以至全部废除各国武装部队和常规军备，撤销在外国领土上的一切军事基地和彻底销毁各种核武器与火箭武器，分三个阶段来实现世界各国的全面彻底裁军。这个建议充分体现了世界各国人民的和平愿望，完全符合他们的切身利益。它是如此合情合理，切实可行，因而得到了各国公正舆论的广泛的支持。
    如果西方国家真正愿意解决裁军问题，那么就应该在苏联裁军建议的基础上来进行讨论。但是，西方国家的做法却是完全与裁军要求背道而驰的。它们在16日和28日会议上先后提出了所谓三阶段裁军方案和十点监督方案。西方的方案根本避而不谈全面彻底裁军的目的、措施与时限，不谈禁止核武器的生产、使用与试验问题，更不谈撤销在外国领土上的军事基地问题。这些方案所津津乐道和孜孜以求的，几乎只有一个监督问题。而它们所主张的这种“监督”，不过是为了使西方国家取得公开搜集社会主义国家军事情报的机会而已。它同真正促成实现裁军的目的是毫无共同之处的。如果把西方方案加以剖析的话，就可以看出，实质上西方国家在第一阶段所要求的是大量搜集包括军队、军备、军费在内的重要情报，第二阶段是更进一步到别的国家去进行实地侦察，第三阶段则是想通过所谓“国际警察队部”来干涉别国的内政。这个方案还特别强调取得关于导弹基地和空间装置计划的情报材料。如果考虑到美国正在拼命发展导弹与空间武器以缩短它在这方面大大落后于苏联的“差距”的情况，人们就不难了解西方国家的真正意图究竟何在了。虽然西方国家在自己的方案中也规定了美苏两国武装部队的限额，看起来似乎像是一种裁军措施。但其荒谬之处也正在这里。因为为了在第一阶段“实现”这样的“裁军”计划，美国还需要再扩军九千九百六十五人！难怪美国“斯通周刊”也认为，这完全是“狡猾的和明摆着的……欺骗”。
    现在裁军会议正围绕着裁军与监督的问题进行讨论。社会主义国家的代表们主张会议的注意力应该首先集中于讨论裁军的措施问题，而西方国家却坚持要以解决“监督”问题作为解决裁军问题的前提。在裁军与监督的相互关系上，究竟应以何者为主，本来是十分清楚的。裁军是目的，监督只是实现这个目的的手段。如果不首先在裁军措施上谋求和达成协议，监督问题的讨论和解决又有什么意义呢？企图把监督问题驾凌于裁军问题之上，甚至要后者取决于前者，完全是一种舍本逐末、本末倒置的做法，其实质是阻挠裁军问题的解决。苏联和其他社会主义国家主张的是有监督的裁军，而美国和西方国家所主张的却是没有裁军的监督。究竟谁是真心愿意裁军，谁是竭力阻挠裁军的实现，这不是十分清楚的吗？
    关于这一点，目前正在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英三国不继续核武器试验的会议的情况，也提供了令人信服的旁证。在这个会议上，苏联代表最近提出了一项重要建议，主张会议缔结一项协定，同意停止一切核武器试验，包括在大气、海洋和外层空间中的试验以及产生幅度在四点七五地震指数以上的地下试验。这是苏联为打开会议僵局而作的重大努力，因为美国过去一向拒绝缔结停止包括地震幅度在四点七五以下的地下核试验的协定。但是，当苏联同意了美国原来的主张时，美国自己却又退缩回去。美国国防部副部长詹姆斯·道格拉斯竟然表示，接受苏联的这个主张，是“违反我们（美国）的立场的”，因为美国军方希望继续试验轻型的核武器。因此，事情很清楚，美国尽管在口头上说它愿意裁军和停止核试验，但是实际上却是竭力阻挠裁军的实现，拒绝停止试验核武器。
    人人都可以看得见，美国一方面在东西方裁军会议上空谈裁军，另一方面却在继续加紧扩军备战的活动。美国军事当局最近宣布，将增拨巨额经费来加速发展“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹和“北极星”式导弹潜艇。北大西洋集团军队的最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德也宣布要建立拥有核武器的所谓“多国家机动特种部队”。美国的许多军政首脑人物都在继续鼓吹加强所谓“威慑力量”，企图挽回美国早已破产了的“实力地位”。在今年早些时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔已经说过：“……在谈判裁减军备问题的同时，我们必须保持高度的军事效能”。美国副总统尼克松也说：“在任何情况下，美国和它的盟国都不可减少它们的兵力”。英国和法国也在继续追随美国增加军费，扩充军备，加紧发展核武器。至于西德，更是嚣张地公开要求取得国外军事基地，充分暴露了它追求扩张侵略的凶相。因此，某些西方报刊曾经透露，西方国家的代表准备在裁军会议上进行无休止的谈判，这并不是毫无根据的臆断。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”曾经写道，西方代表们是带着进行很长期的谈判的明显意图前往日内瓦的。英国“观察家报”也指出，“西方代表团在日内瓦将准备进行缓慢和长期谈判，就像迄今继续了十七个月的不继续核试验会议的那样”。因此，人们有理由怀疑，美国和某些西方国家实际上是要把裁军会议作为它们进行扩军的烟幕。
    中国人民是一贯主张实行普遍裁军并且积极支持苏联关于全面彻底裁军建议的。我国人民和我国政府过去已经以实际的行动表现了自己对维护和平和实现裁军的真诚愿望。正如我国陈毅副总理兼外交部长所说的，“今后我国政府和人民仍将同我们的伟大盟邦苏联和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，不遗余力地为争取普遍裁军和保卫世界和平而进行不屈不挠的斗争”。我国人民同其他各国人民一样，密切注意着裁军会议的发展，要求西方国家拿出解决裁军问题的诚意来。
