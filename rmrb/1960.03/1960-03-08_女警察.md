Female Police Officer

	The female police officer stands in the middle of the road,
	Waving her baton to greet the morning sun.
	Small red flags flash past her eyes,
	Loaded trucks speed towards the newly built factory.

	The female police officer stands in the middle of the road,
	A stream of diligent people surges past her side.
	Striding swiftly on the road of peace,
	Her heart is filled with the sunshine of happiness.

	The female police officer stands in the middle of the road,
	She conducts the grand chorus of the street.
	As her baton rises and falls,
	Ten thousand kinds of musical sounds resonate in triumphant symphony.

    女警察
    女警察站在路中央，
    迎着朝霞挥起了指挥棒。
    小红旗眼前疾飘而过，
    载重车驰向那新盖的工厂。
    女警察站在路中央，
    勤劳的人流涌过她身旁。
    在和平的大道上健步如飞，
    她心里洒满了幸福的阳光。
    女警察站在路中央，
    她指挥着街道上的大合唱。
    随着那指挥棍一起一落，
    万种乐音得意地共鸣交响。
