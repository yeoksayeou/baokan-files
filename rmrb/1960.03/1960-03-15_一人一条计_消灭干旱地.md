Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: In the Guanzhong Weibei Plateau area of Shaanxi Province, various people's communes are doing everything possible to divert water to the plateau, expand the irrigated area, and combat drought to protect wheat. Since February 5th, the irrigated area on the plateau has increased from 1.28 million mu to 1.49 million mu, three times more than the total irrigated area expanded last year. Many arid wheat fields that had never been irrigated before have now been irrigated.

The Weibei Loess Plateau, bounded by the Yellow River to the east and Gansu Province to the west, includes all or part of the land in nine counties and cities: Hancheng, Dali, Pucheng, Qianxian, Binxian, Xianyang, Tongchuan, Xingping, and Fengxiang. The wheat fields in this area account for more than a quarter of the total wheat area in the province. Therefore, strengthening the struggle against drought and protecting wheat on the Weibei Plateau is the key for Shaanxi Province to strive for a bumper harvest in the first season this year.

The continued development of drought has not shaken the determination of the people of the Weibei Plateau to win a bumper harvest in the first season. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people of Weibei are relying on the strong manpower and financial resources of the people's communes, doing everything possible to intercept and block rivers, lift water to the plateau, and dig deep wells to carry out spring irrigation, waging a tenacious struggle. Taking well-digging as an example, the number in the eight counties and cities alone has surged from more than 1,400 on February 5th to more than 9,000 in early March. The Fangzhen Commune in Hancheng County, located on the west bank of the Yellow River, was determined to change the unfavorable conditions of low water and high ground. It rushed to repair a pumping station to pump water from the Yellow River to the plateau, expanding the irrigation of more than 6,000 mu of dryland wheat fields. The Xizhuang Commune, a semi-mountainous and semi-plateau area in the county, dug 614 large and small water springs in five days, adopting methods such as intercepting water at each section, storing water in sections, building bridges across ditches, and multi-stage water lifting, irrigating more than 70,000 mu of wheat fields that were not usually irrigated. In some places far from water, commune members transported water from high-voltage lines and water lifted by derricks, using livestock and carts to send it to the plateau for irrigation. Fengxiang County used these methods to overcome difficulties such as deep ditches, high plateaus, dry ponds, and intermittent canal water. From February 15th to March 1st, the county's 1.23 million mu of wheat and 220,000 mu of summer miscellaneous grain fields were generally irrigated with water for greening, of which 1.09 million mu were irrigated twice, and 730,000 mu were irrigated three times.

All localities generally attach importance to improving irrigation methods, improving irrigation quality, combining wells into canals, and using water multiple times, achieving economical water use. The Xingzhen Commune in Pucheng County combined all the newly dug wells of the commune's 41 production teams into canals for long-distance irrigation, increasing the commune's irrigated area from the original 400 mu to more than 3,000 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th: The drought resistance movement in the Jinan area of Shandong has entered a "tough battle" stage. The task of watering the land in the plains with sufficient water conservancy conditions has been basically completed. The remaining 20% of wheat fields are distributed in mountainous and hilly areas where water sources are scarce. In order to completely overcome the spring drought, people's communes in various regions have launched a communist-style collaboration across the region, with the strong helping the weak, the fast helping the slow, and the plains helping the mountainous areas. Workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers are all mobilized, and machinery and tools are all deployed, supporting whatever is lacking and wherever there is a shortage, greatly accelerating the progress of spring irrigation in the entire region. As of March 5th, 80% of the wheat in the region has been watered, and more than 80,000 mu of spring fields have been irrigated.

In Taian City, more than 59,000 people from various people's communes participated in the collaboration, along with more than 600 head of livestock. Among them, 36 production teams with faster drought resistance progress brought their own water pumps and various water lifting tools to support the mountain production teams, irrigating more than 26,000 mu of mountain wheat fields. There are 177 brigades in Feicheng County that participated in collaborative support. They adopted methods such as combining well water for long-distance irrigation and building bridges over ditches to bring water to the mountains in every possible way to support remote areas. The Wenyang Commune in the county actively assisted the water-deficient Bianyuan Commune with a flow rate, enabling the Bianyuan Commune to quickly complete the wheat watering task. Cao Jikui, secretary of the Huangzhuang Brigade Party Branch of Bianyuan Commune, heard that the Guzhuang Brigade lacked tools and labor, and immediately selected 85 strong young men, bringing two water pumps and dozens of water wheels to support them. Various counties and communes actively explored new water sources in supporting drought resistance and irrigation in mountainous and remote areas. Feicheng County organized more than 19,000 water conservancy professionals from the plains and mountains, digging more than 11,000 wells, excavating more than 350 mountain springs, and intercepting undercurrents and gate rivers in more than 360 places, adding a large amount of water source for spring irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: In the struggle to prevent and combat drought, Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County in Gansu Province has widely mobilized people of all ethnic groups to inspect and rank cultivated land plot by plot, carefully summarizing and collecting the drought resistance experience and opinions of the masses, and formulating various specific measures to combat drought and spring planting in every possible way. After three months of active efforts, the county's soil moisture-saturated fields have reached more than 980,000 mu, an increase of 46.5% compared to the original.

Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County is both a high-altitude cold mountain area and an arid area. Since last autumn, due to sparse rain and snow, most of the cultivated land has insufficient soil moisture. In order to eliminate the spring drought and achieve timely spring planting, the county launched a movement of "one person, one idea, eliminate arid land." All communes and teams held various forms of symposiums for commune members, allowing them to freely discuss their experience in drought prevention and resistance and their opinions on the current drought prevention and resistance. Based on the experiences and opinions shared by the vast number of commune members, the county party committee put forward eight drought resistance measures: excavating springs, digging wells, and intercepting and diverting underground water; vigorously grasping economic water use, planting more in shady areas, and increasing soil moisture-saturated fields; laying sand in dry areas; accelerating the construction progress of existing water conservancy projects, and striving to achieve benefits as soon as possible; preparing drought-resistant crop seeds as early as possible, and expanding the planting area of drought-resistant crops; and achieving "planting summer crops first in areas with sufficient soil moisture, and then creating soil moisture in autumn fields," and so on.

After these measures were put forward, the county party committee immediately strengthened the leadership of the drought resistance front. It successively convened a five-level cadre meeting and a rally to launch water conservancy construction and drought resistance, mobilizing the people of the county to encircle and suppress the drought from all directions. The broad masses of people were enthusiastic and completed 24 water interception projects, dug 750 wells, and excavated more than 60,000 springs in three months. The irrigation professional teams of various people's communes also visited and learned from the experience of economical water use in Xinglongxia, Yuzhong County, and organized two teams, one to cut corners and fill depressions on the plains to reduce seepage, and the other to break ice and divert water to speed up the flow rate. In this way, the utilization rate of general water flow in the county has increased by about one time compared to the original. The number of new sand fields laid by various people's communes in dry areas has also exceeded the plan by nearly one time. While vigorously grasping water conservancy construction and preparatory work for farming, the county party committee put forward the slogan of "breaking the rules to grow crops, and rushing to plant the land with soil moisture." Many people's communes started spring planting about 40 days in advance. Many people's communes also adopted methods such as digging pits for irrigation, using water to soak seeds, spring-induced germination, ditching and sprinkling water, mixing water and applying fertilizer, applying wet soil to the ground, and planting with water-powered plows to create soil moisture for planting on dry slopes.

    一人一条计　消灭干旱地
    渭北地区截流堵河引水上高原普浇麦田
    济南地区抗旱大协作农田及时得到灌溉
    天祝藏族自治县总结经验订出抗旱措施
    据新华社西安电　陕西省关中渭北高原各人民公社千方百计引水上高原，扩大灌溉面积，抗旱保麦。从2月5日以来，高原灌溉面积已由一百二十八万亩增加到一百四十九万亩，比去年全年扩大的灌溉面积增加三倍，许多过去未浇过水的干旱麦田都得到灌溉。
    渭北黄土高原东至黄河，西临甘肃省界，包括韩城、大荔、蒲城、乾县、邠县、咸阳、铜川、兴平、凤翔等九个县、市的全部或部分土地，这一带的麦田占全省麦田总面积四分之一以上。因此，加强渭北高原抗旱保麦斗争，是陕西省力争今年第一季大丰收的关键。
    旱象持续发展并没有动摇渭北高原人民誓夺第一季大丰收的决心。渭北人民在各级党委领导下，依靠人民公社雄厚的人力、财力，千方百计地截流堵河提水上原，深挖地层打井春灌，进行着顽强的斗争。以打井为例，仅八县、市就由2月5日的一千四百多眼猛增到3月上旬的九千多眼。位于黄河西岸的韩城县方镇公社决心改变水低原高的不利条件，突击抢修了一座抽水站，把黄河水抽上高原，扩灌了六千多亩旱原麦田。这个县的半山半原的西庄公社社员，五天内挖掘大小水泉六百一十四处，采取节节拦挡，段段蓄水，逢沟架桥，多级提水等方法，浇灌了经常浇灌不到的麦田七万多亩。在有些距水较远的地方，社员们把高线运的水和吊杆提的水再用牲口驮、车拉，送上了高原浇地。凤翔县采用这些办法，克服了沟深、原高、池水干涸、渠水断流等困难，从2月15日到3月1日，全县一百二十三万多亩小麦和二十二万亩夏杂粮田普遍浇了一次返青水，其中并有一百零九万亩浇了二次水，七十三万亩浇了三次水。
  各地都普遍重视改进灌溉方法，提高灌溉质量，并井成渠，一水多浇，做到了经济用水。蒲城县兴镇公社把全社四十一个生产队新打成的井并成渠，长引远浇，使全社灌溉面积由原来的四百多亩增加到三千多亩。
    新华社济南14日电　山东济南地区的抗旱运动，已经进入一个“攻坚”阶段；水利条件充足的平原地区浇地任务已经基本完成，剩下20％左右的麦田分布在山区和丘陵地带，水源条件缺乏。各地人民公社为了彻底战胜春旱，在全区内展开了强帮弱、快帮慢、平原帮山区的共产主义大协作。工农商学兵齐出征，机械、工具齐出动，缺什么支援什么，哪里缺就支援哪里，大大加快了全区的春灌进度。截至3月5日，全区80％的小麦已经浇过，并且灌春田八万多亩。
    泰安市各人民公社参加协作的达五万九千多人，牲口六百多犋，其中三十六个抗旱进度快的生产大队，自带抽水机和各种提水工具支援山区生产队，使二万六千多亩山地麦田浇上了水。肥城县参加协作支援的大队有一百七十七个，他们采取井水并流远浇、遇沟架桥等办法，千方百计地把水引上山，支援边远地区。这个县的汶阳公社主动地援助缺水的边院公社一个流量，使边院公社很快地完成了小麦浇水任务。边院公社黄庄大队党支部书记曹吉奎听说古庄大队工具不足、劳力缺乏，马上挑选了八十五名精壮的小伙子，带着两部抽水机和几十部水车去支援。各县社在支援山区边远地区抗旱浇地中，积极挖掘新水源。肥城县组织了平原、山区一万九千多名水利专业大军，打井一万一千多眼，挖山泉三百五十多个，截潜流和闸河三百六十多处，为春浇地增加了大量水源。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省天祝藏族自治县在防旱抗旱斗争中，广泛发动各族群众对耕地逐块验墒排队，并细致总结和搜集群众抗旱经验和意见，制订各项具体措施，千方百计抗旱春播。经过三个月的积极努力，全县的饱墒田已达九十八万多亩，比原来增加了46．5％。
    天祝藏族自治县既是高寒山区又是干旱地区，去秋以来，由于雨雪稀少，大部耕地墒气不足。为了消灭春旱，做到适时春播，全县开展了一个“一人一条计，消灭干旱地”的运动。各社、队都召开了各种不同形式的社员座谈会，让社员畅谈防旱抗旱的经验和他们对当前防旱抗旱的意见。县委根据广大社员所谈的经验和意见，提出了八项抗旱措施，就是：掏泉、打井、截引地下水；狠抓经济用水，多种二阴地，增加饱墒田；在干旱地区，大铺砂田；加速现有水利工程的施工进度，力争早日发挥效益；及早准备耐旱作物的种子，扩大耐旱作物播种面积；做到“有墒先种夏，秋田再造墒”等等。
    这些措施提出后，县委立即加强了抗旱战线的领导。先后召开了全县五级干部会、兴修水利抗旱誓师大会，发动全县人民，从四面八方向干旱展开围攻。广大群众干劲冲天，在三个月内，就完成截水工程二十四处、打井七百五十眼、掏泉六万多眼。各人民公社的灌溉专业队，也都参观学习了榆中县兴隆峡经济用水的经验，并组织了两套人马，一面在平地截弯填凹，减少渗漏；一面破冰引水，加快流速。这样，全县一般水流的利用率，都比原来提高了一倍左右。干旱地区的各人民公社铺新砂田的数量也超过计划近一倍。县委在大抓兴修水利和备耕工作的同时，提出了“打破常规种庄稼、抢墒播种社社抓”的口号。许多人民公社都提前四十天左右开耧春播。许多人民公社还采取挖窝灌水、用水浸种、春化催芽、开沟洒水、拌水施肥、湿土上地、水耧播种等办法造墒播种干旱的坡地。（附图片）
