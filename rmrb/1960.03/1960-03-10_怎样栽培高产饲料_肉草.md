    How to Cultivate High-Yield Fodder – Meat Grass
    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Daily published our county's article "Meat Grass – High-Yield, High-Quality Fodder" on December 24th last year, we have received more than 100 telegrams and letters from various provinces (autonomous regions), and cities, inquiring about the planting methods and growing environment of meat grass. In addition to answering individually, we have now written a detailed material for publication in the newspaper for reference.
    Meat grass, also known as bamboo basket grass, goose dish, belongs to the Commelinaceae family, scientifically known as *Murdannia loriformis*, is an aquatic plant. It has strong growth, fast propagation, high yield, good nutrition, and a sweet taste, making it a good pig feed. Meat grass was originally a perennial wild vegetable, mostly growing near villages, ditches, and damp places. When cultivated, sandy loam and clay soil are better, but heavy clay soil and dry places are most undesirable. The most suitable temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius. In this weather, it can grow 1 to 1.5 inches a day. At about 2 degrees Celsius, growth is slower. It will not freeze to death even when the temperature drops to zero degrees. In addition, it is resistant to diseases and pests and rarely suffers from them.
    Our county's meat grass cultivation methods are:
    1.  Seedling selection: Meat grass is planted with stem nodes. When planting, it is best to select strong and uniform seedlings as seeds.
    2.  Field selection and preparation: When planting, it is necessary to select fields and ditches with convenient transportation and perennial flowing water. However, deep water paddy fields of three to four feet are not suitable for planting, because on the one hand, it is difficult to harvest, and on the other hand, the water is deep and the soil is cold, the growth is not fast, and the yield is low. After selecting the field, plow twice and harrow three times, and apply 1,500 to 2,000 catties of pig manure as base fertilizer to level the land, so as to facilitate drainage, irrigation, fertilization, and maintenance.
    3.  Rational close planting: Planting specifications, for forage, a spacing of one foot between plants and one foot between rows is good, and for fertilizer, a spacing of one foot between plants and eight inches between rows is appropriate; if it is too sparse, the stem nodes will grow many roots, and branching will not be fast, and if it is planted too densely, the growth will be thin and weak, easy to lodging and difficult to harvest, which will also affect the yield. When planting, as with rice planting, insert two to three seedlings per plant, each 6 to 8 inches long. It will revive in two to three days after planting.
    4.  Management and fertilization: Irrigation is mainly shallow water irrigation. In winter and spring, when the weather is cold, irrigate more, and in summer and autumn, irrigate less. Special attention should be paid not to let pigs, chickens, ducks and other poultry step on it. About 15 to 20 days after planting, timely topdressing is required. Apply 600 to 700 catties of plant ash evenly per mu each time. After each harvest, fertilize immediately, applying 20 to 30 dan of pig manure mixed with plant ash each time to ensure sufficient fertilizer to meet its growth needs and achieve rapid growth, quick harvesting, multiple harvests and high yields.
    5.  Harvesting: Meat grass grows rapidly, especially in the spring, summer and autumn when the weather is suitable, it can be harvested two to three times a month. Therefore, timely harvesting is the key to a bumper harvest. It should be harvested when the seedlings are 2 to 2.5 feet long, otherwise the quality will be poor after aging, and it will also affect branching and reduce the yield per unit area. Use a sickle to harvest carefully. When cutting, leave two to three inches from the root, and do not pull it up by the root. If it is used as feed after harvesting, it can be washed, chopped short, and fed raw or cooked to pigs and other livestock and poultry.

### 怎样栽培高产饲料——肉草

    怎样栽培高产饲料——肉草编辑同志：
    去年12月24日人民日报发表了我县写的“肉草——高产优质饲料”的文章以后，我们先后接到各省（区）、市的电报和来信一百多件，询问有关肉草的种植方法和生长环境等问题，我们除了个别答复以外，现又写一详细材料，请在报上发表，供各地参考。
    肉草又名竹箕草，鹅几菜属鸭跖草科，学名水竹叶、是一种水生植物。生长力强、繁殖快产量高、营养好、味甜，是养猪的好饲料。肉草原是一种一年四季长生的野菜，多生长在村边，沟边近潮湿的地方。栽培时，以沙质壤土和粘质土较好，最忌重粘土和干燥的地方。最适宜的温度是摄氏二十度至三十度之间，在这样的天气，一天能长一至一点五寸。在摄氏二度左右，生长较慢。温度降到零度时也不会冻死。此外，抗病虫力强，很少受病虫害。
    我们县肉草栽培办法是：
    一、选苗：肉草是用茎节来种的，种植时最好选采生长粗壮均匀的苗来作种苗。
    二、选田整田：种时选田必须选便利运输，长年流水的田水沟。但三至四尺的深水田不宜种，因为一方面不好收，另一方面，水深土冷，生长不快，产量低。选好田后，进行二犁三耙，放猪粪一千五百至二千斤做基肥，把土地拖平，这样才方便排水灌水和施肥护理等工作。
    三、合理密植：种植规格，作饲料的以株距一尺，行距一尺为好，作肥料的株距一尺，行距八寸为宜；过稀茎节生根多，分枝不快，种密了生长细弱，易倒伏不好收割，也影响产量。种时与种田一样，每蔸插二至三条，每条长六至八寸，种后二至三天就回生了。
    四、管理施肥：灌水以浅水灌溉为主，冬春两季，天气较冷灌水多些，夏秋两季灌水少些，并要特别注意，不要让猪、鸡、鸭等禽畜进去残踏。种后约十五天至二十天，要及时追肥，每次每亩均匀施草木灰六百至七百斤。以后每收一次，随即施肥一次，每次放猪粪拌草木灰二十至三十担，以保证有足够的肥料满足它的生长需要，达到快生快割，多收高产。
    五、收割：肉草生长迅速，尤其在春夏秋三季天气适宜，一个月可采收二至三次。因此采收及时，是一个丰产的关键。在苗长二至二点五尺，即应采收，不然长老以后质量不好，还会影响分枝，降低单位面积产量。收时利用镰刀，小心采割。割时要离根部二至三寸，不要连根拔起来。采收后若做饲料可洗净切短生喂或煮熟喂猪和喂其它家畜家禽。
