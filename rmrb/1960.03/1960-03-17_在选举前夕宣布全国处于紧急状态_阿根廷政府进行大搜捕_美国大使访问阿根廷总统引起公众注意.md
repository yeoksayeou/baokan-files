Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, March 15th: On the eve of the upcoming Argentine parliamentary elections, the Argentine government suddenly announced a national state of emergency on the 13th, and simultaneously promulgated an "emergency measures" decree. According to this decree, the armed forces can designate "military zones" in any area of the country, and anyone deemed to have committed "acts of terrorism" or "endangered national security" will be tried by military tribunals. On the 14th, the Minister of the Interior also ordered all provinces to place the police under the command of the military during the "state of emergency."

    The aforementioned decisions were announced after a meeting between Argentine President Frondizi and the Minister of Defense and the ministers of the three armed services.

    The official reason given for taking these measures was the recent series of explosions. However, politicians in the Argentine capital have expressed doubt and condemnation regarding these measures. Alfredo Palacios, leader of the Argentine Socialist Party, published an article stating that other repressive laws were also approved under similar circumstances. He said that according to the "emergency measures," people can be arbitrarily sentenced to death, which allows the government to commit various crimes at will, and these crimes are far more serious than crimes of an individual nature.

    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, March 16th: After the Argentine authorities announced a national "state of emergency" on the 13th, the military has begun to deploy forces at stations, power plants, radio stations, and other locations, and has taken control of transportation and public utilities.

    Starting in the early morning of the 15th, large-scale arrests were carried out in the Argentine capital and the province of Buenos Aires. Police under the command of the military closed the offices and publishing organs of the Peronist Party. According to United Press International, Argentine military forces are demanding "more resolute measures" against Peronists and Communists.

    The US Ambassador to Argentina paid a surprise visit to Argentine President Frondizi on the 14th. Frondizi interrupted his meeting with the ministers of the three armed services to receive the US ambassador. This visit by the US ambassador has drawn the attention of the Argentine public.

    Some Argentine political leaders have expressed their opinions on current events. Ernesto Sanmartino, a candidate for the People's Radical Civic Union, said: Emergency measures will lead to military dictatorship. He said that if elections are held under such measures, he will ask the members of his faction in parliament to demand the cancellation of the elections.

    在选举前夕宣布全国处于紧急状态
    阿根廷政府进行大搜捕
    美国大使访问阿根廷总统引起公众注意
    据新华社15日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：在阿根廷议会选举即将举行的时候，阿根廷政府突然在13日宣布全国处于紧急状态，同时颁布了一项“紧急措施”法令。按照这一法令，武装部队得在全国任何地区划定“军事区”，凡被认为有“恐怖行为”或“违害国家安全”的人都将由军事法庭审判。内政部长在14日还命令各省在“紧急状态”期间把警察交由军队指挥。
    上述决定，是阿根廷总统弗朗迪西和国防部长及三军部长会晤后公布的。
    据官方宣布采取这些措施的理由是最近连续发生了爆炸事件。但是阿根廷首都的政治家们对这些措施却表示怀疑和谴责。阿根廷社会党领袖阿尔弗雷多·帕拉西奥斯发表文章说，其他一些镇压性法律也是在类似的情况下批准的，他说，按照“紧急措施”，人们可以随意被判处死刑，这就使政府可以随意犯下各种罪行，这些罪行比个人性质的罪行要严重得多。
    据新华社16日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷当局13日宣布全国处于“紧急状态”后，军队已开始在车站、发电厂、电台等处所布防，并且控制了交通和公用事业。
    15日清晨开始，在阿根廷首都和布宜诺斯艾利斯省进行了大规模搜捕。受军队指挥的警察封闭了庇隆主义党的办事处和出版机关。据合众国际社报道，阿根廷军事势力要求对庇隆主义者和共产党采取
  “更坚决的措施”。
    美国驻阿根廷大使14日突然访问了阿根廷总统弗朗迪西。弗朗迪西为接待这个美国大使，中断了他同三军部长举行的会议。美国大使的这次访问引起了阿根廷公众的注意。
    阿根廷一些政治领袖就当前事件发表了他们的意见。人民激进公民联盟议员候选人埃尔内斯托·圣马蒂诺说：紧急措施会导致军事独裁。他说，如果在实行这种措施的情况下举行选举，他将要求他的派别的议员提出取消选举的要求。
