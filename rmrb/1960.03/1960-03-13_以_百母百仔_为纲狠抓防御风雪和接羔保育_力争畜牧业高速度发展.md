    Grasp the Prevention of Wind, Snow, and Lambing Care with "One Hundred Lambs per Hundred Ewes" as the Key to Strive for High-Speed Development of Animal Husbandry
    (Reported by this newspaper) A great situation is unfolding on the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Following the great leap forward in animal husbandry last year, people of all ethnic groups are advancing victoriously. Taking "One Hundred Lambs per Hundred Ewes" as the key, they are vigorously grasping the prevention of wind, snow, and lambing care, and vigorously engaging in technological innovation to develop animal husbandry production at high speed.
    Since the beginning of spring, good news of bumper harvests has spread across the grasslands. As of March 8th, the region has already delivered more than 3.62 million winter and early spring lambs, more than one million more than the same period last year, with a survival rate of 93.2%. Among these young animals, more than 553,000 are purebred or first and second generation hybrid improved young animals. Currently, large-scale spring lambing is about to begin, and people of all ethnic groups are fighting to win a great harvest in animal husbandry this year. The 100,000 people of all ethnic groups on the Xilin Gol grassland have transported large quantities of feed to the lambing camps. A three-way combination of herdsmen, lambing caregivers, and veterinary technicians has launched a vigorous spring livestock protection and increase red flag competition. Herdsmen in the Hulunbuir grassland, based on the characteristics of strong spring wind and snow, have also launched a "safe livestock herd" movement. Among the 569 livestock herds in the New Barag Right Banner, 97% of the herds have achieved safety with no losses. Now, a new situation of good condition, high reproduction, high survival, and good quality has emerged on the animal husbandry front in the autonomous region. More than eight million pregnant ewes on the major grasslands are also in good condition, waiting for the arrival of the lambing period. In this way, the region is expected to produce and raise more than two million more young animals than last year, which will be an unprecedented great harvest in animal husbandry.
    The "One Hundred Lambs per Hundred Ewes" movement on the Inner Mongolia animal husbandry front is a new thing that has emerged after the people's communes. The development of this movement has accelerated the production and construction in pastoral areas. In order to breed and raise one hundred live lambs per hundred ewes a year, the people's communes have established and restored a number of livestock breeding stations in conjunction with winter lambing care. More than 320,000 ewes, selected for their light mouths, strong bodies, and rapid post-partum recovery, have undergone secondary breeding. Most of these ewes are now pregnant and will be able to lamb again in the summer. In order to meet the winter and spring water needs of livestock, more than 6,600 water wells have been dug on the pastures, exceeding the annual plan for this year, and can provide drinking water for three million livestock. Since last year, the people's communes have also built more than 287,000 livestock pens (rooms). Now, all small livestock, young livestock, ewes, and old and weak livestock in the region have warm sheds and warm pens, safely spending the spring wind and snow period. In order to strengthen the spring livestock epidemic prevention and control work, all people's communes have also trained epidemic prevention personnel and prepared medicines for the prevention and control of lamb dysentery.
    Another important feature of the continued leap forward in animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia this year is the new development of technological transformation in animal husbandry. Since the beginning of this year, people's communes, state-owned farms, mechanical farms, grassland tractor stations, and mechanical grass cultivation stations distributed on the grasslands have purchased 40 standard tractors, more than 240 seeders, and a large number of new-style farm implements, and are preparing to vigorously reclaim wasteland on the grasslands to further establish grain and feed bases, so that pastoral breeding can be developed in combination with planting. All people's communes have also purchased more than 200 feed crushers and 950 combined power, animal power, and human-powered chaff cutters, greatly increasing the labor productivity in spring livestock feeding management. At the same time, people in the autonomous region have carried out technological innovations and created and reformed more than 100 kinds of water lifting, snow breaking, transportation, and other tools.
    In order to rapidly change the face of pastoral areas, this year the state and the autonomous region will continue to send more than 330 standard tractors and a batch of combine harvesters, large threshing machines, and automobiles to pastoral areas to equip agricultural and pastoral production in pastoral areas. At the same time, they will also support herdsmen with more than 6,600 mowing machines and 4,000 waterwheels. In this way, animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia this year will take a big step towards semi-mechanization. (Attached picture)

### 以“百母百仔”为纲狠抓防御风雪和接羔保育  力争畜牧业高速度发展

    以“百母百仔”为纲狠抓防御风雪和接羔保育
    力争畜牧业高速度发展
    本报讯　辽阔的内蒙古草原牧场上，目前正是一片大好形势。各族牧民，继去年畜牧业的大跃进，乘胜前进，以“百母百仔”为纲，狠抓防御风雪和接羔保育，大闹技术革新，高速度地发展畜牧业生产。
    入春以来，草原上就传出了丰收捷报。到3月8日，全区已经接产了三百六十二万多头冬羔和早春羔，比去年同期多一百多万头，幼畜成活率达93．2％。这批幼畜中，有五十五万三千多头是纯种和第一、二代杂交改良仔畜。目前，大规模的春季接羔就要开始了，各族牧民，正为夺取今年畜牧业大丰收奋战。锡林郭勒草原上的十万名各族牧民，把大批饲料运到接羔营地；放牧饲养员、接羔保育员和兽医技术员三结合，开展了轰轰烈烈的春季保畜增畜红旗竞赛运动。呼伦贝尔草原牧民，根据春季草原风雪大的特点，还开展了“安全畜群”运动，新巴尔虎右旗的五百六十九群牲畜中，有97％的群，已经达到安全无损失。现在自治区畜牧业战线上出现了膘情好、繁殖多、成活高、质量好的新局面。各大草原牧场上的八百多万头怀胎母畜，也都膘好体壮，等待着产期的到来。这样，今年全区大约能比去年多接产保育二百多万头幼畜，这将是一个空前的畜牧业大丰收。
    内蒙古畜牧业战线上的“百母百仔”运动，是人民公社化后出现的新事物。这一运动的开展，又加速了牧区生产建设。为了每百头母畜一年繁殖成活一百头仔畜，人民公社结合冬季接羔保育，建立和恢复了一批牲畜配种站。挑选口轻体壮，产后体质恢复较快的三十二万多只母羊，进行了第二次配种。现在这批母羊大部分已受胎，到夏季就能再次产羔了。为满足牲畜冬春饮水需要，在牧场上打了六千六百多眼水井，超额完成了今年全年计划，可供三百万头牲畜饮水。去年以来，人民公社还新建了二十八万七千多座（间）牲畜圈棚，现在全区小畜、幼畜、母畜和老弱畜，都有了暖棚暖圈，安全地度着春季风雪期。各人民公社为了加强春季畜疫防治工作，还训练防疫人员，准备了防治羔羊痢疾的药品。
    今年内蒙古畜牧业生产继续跃进的另一个重要特点，是畜牧业的技术改造有新的发展。今年以来，分布在草原上的人民公社、国营牧场、机械农场、草原拖拉机站和机械育草站，已经买了四十个标准台拖拉机、二百四十多台播种机和大量新式农具，正准备在草原上大力开垦荒地，进一步建立粮食饲料基地，使牧区饲养业与种植业相结合地发展。各人民公社还购置了二百多台饲料粉碎机和九百五十多台动力、畜力、人力三用铡草机，大大提高了春季牲畜饲养管理方面的劳动生产率。同时，自治区牧民开展技术革新，创造和改革了一百多种提水、破雪、运输等工具。
    为了迅速改变牧区面貌，今年国家和自治区继续向牧区输送三百三十多个标准台拖拉机和一批联合收割机、大型脱谷机、汽车，装备牧区农牧业生产，同时，还支援牧民六千六百多台打搂草机和四千部水车。这样，今年内蒙古畜牧业生产将向半机械化大大迈进一步。（附图片）
