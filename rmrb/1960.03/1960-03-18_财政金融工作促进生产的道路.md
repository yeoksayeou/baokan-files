    The Road of Fiscal and Financial Work to Promote Production
    Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Fiscal and financial work is an important component of the economic front. Doing this work well can not only increase accumulation and invigorate the market, but more importantly, it can promote the high-speed development of production. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, Shanghai’s fiscal and financial work, through great mass practice, found a broad path for socialist fiscal and financial work to serve production, thus showing its increasingly greater role in promoting the high-speed development of production.
    The fundamental task of fiscal and financial work is to promote the high-speed development of production, starting from production.

    In the organically linked whole of the various departments of the national economy, production is the most fundamental. It is the foundation of fiscal and financial work. Because only when production develops and the economy prospers can the source of funds be expanded and accumulation increased. Therefore, as early as 1934, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Increasing our financial income from the development of the national economy is the basic principle of our financial policy." He also pointed out in 1942: "Developing the economy and ensuring supply are the general principles of our economic and financial work." "The quality of financial policy certainly affects the economy, but it is the economy that determines finance." Chairman Mao's economic policy thinking is the specific application and development of Marxism-Leninism in my country's economic construction. The fiscal and economic work led by our party for decades, especially the fiscal and economic work since the Great Leap Forward, undeniably proves the unparalleled correctness and great power of this thought. It is under the guidance of this thought that our fiscal and economic work has continuously achieved great victories.

    Under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialist construction, Shanghai, like the rest of the country, has realized a continuous Great Leap Forward in the national economy. In 1958, the industrial output value increased by 50.2% compared with 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 43.3% on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The Great Leap Forward in production brought about a Great Leap Forward in finance, enabling Shanghai's fiscal revenue and bank deposits to increase significantly. In 1958, fiscal revenue increased by 60% compared with 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 44% compared with 1958; fiscal and enterprise deposits also increased by 46.1% and 29.2% respectively. This growth rate is unprecedented. The high-speed growth of fiscal revenue and bank deposits has powerfully supported the further leap forward in production. In 1958, fiscal expenditure increased by 241.7% compared with 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 29.3% compared with 1958; bank loans also increased by 43.9% and 58.8% respectively. The policy of "more income, more expenditure, more construction; more income, more expenditure, more construction" has been realized. These facts prove that the high-speed development of production determines the high-speed development of finance; the high-speed development of finance, in turn, becomes an important force driving the development of production.

    Starting from production and promoting the high-speed development of production is the fundamental task of fiscal and financial work. According to the practice of the past two years, the road for fiscal and financial work to promote production is very broad, and there are many methods. The fiscal and financial departments are comprehensive business departments, and they have extremely broad and close ties with production, circulation, and distribution. Therefore, they have a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, master more abundant information, and reflect problems more promptly. As long as we are good at using the characteristics of comprehensive departments and use our own business tools, fiscal and financial departments can serve production in many ways and fully play a positive role in promoting production. The main methods for Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments to promote production are to go deep into enterprises, conduct economic activity analysis, and rank various economic indicators in production (including output, quality, cost), materials, and funds. Through analysis and comparison between plans and actual results, current and previous periods, factories and factories, workshops and workshops, and teams and groups, find the gap between advanced and backward, discover problems, and take different measures according to different situations. When some enterprises encounter insufficient main raw materials and a large amount of stagnant materials in the process of production development, which affects the normal progress of production, the fiscal and financial departments, on the one hand, promptly and actively supply funds according to production needs, and on the other hand, actively help enterprises clear materials, tap potential, improve systems, strengthen raw material management, and improve management levels. When some enterprises encounter shortages of raw materials, equipment, and labor, as well as certain technical problems, in the process of production development, which cannot be solved by the enterprises themselves or the fiscal and financial departments, the fiscal and financial departments use the favorable conditions of wide contacts and adopt methods such as "linking up," "bridging," and "threading the needle" to organize cooperation between enterprises. When individual cooperation cannot meet the needs of high-speed production development, we promote the organization of comprehensive large-scale cooperation; communicate what is available and support each other on a larger scale, as a supplement to the national plan balance. In order to enable all enterprises to increase production, reduce costs, accelerate capital turnover, and improve labor productivity, fiscal and financial departments actively promote enterprises to strengthen economic accounting, carry out mass-based team accounting, closely combine team accounting with the mass movement of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, closely combine professional accounting with mass-based team accounting, mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and promote enterprises to create more material wealth with the least manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments actively serve the high-speed development of production through the above-mentioned methods and measures. As a result, the communist spirit of cooperation between various departments and enterprises has been promoted. They have worked together to overcome certain temporary difficulties in the process of production development, and promoted the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become more advanced; not only has the Great Leap Forward in production been realized, but also the Great Leap Forward in fiscal and financial work has been realized, and the tasks of fiscal and financial work have been successfully completed and overfulfilled. For example, in 1959, under the direct leadership of the Yangshupu District Committee, district-wide comprehensive cooperation was carried out, including finance, banks, and all district enterprises. As a result of this cooperation, thirty enterprises that originally had difficulties in completing the national plan generally completed the national plan two to six days ahead of schedule, twenty key products successfully passed the test, eleven export products were also guaranteed to complete the task, and the trial production of twenty-six high-end products and new products proceeded smoothly. At the same time, it also powerfully supported the development of technological innovation and technological revolution. The district's industrial production in the fourth quarter increased by 25% compared with the third quarter, profits increased by 32%, tax revenue increased by 26%, the turnover rate of working capital accelerated by 22.2%, and credit funds decreased by 3.4%.

    Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments have, through a series of activities of going deep into production, participating in production, and promoting production, on the one hand, promoted the development of production, and on the other hand, embodied the supervisory role of fiscal and credit. Practice has proved that there is no contradiction between serving production and implementing fiscal and credit supervision. As long as this supervision starts from caring about production, from enthusiastic assistance, and takes correct measures, then this supervision is completely necessary and is also needed by enterprises. Therefore, as long as we truly do a good job of serving production, we will inevitably do a good job of supervision.

    Launching mass movements, combining internal and external efforts, and cooperating in all aspects are the keys to doing a good job in fiscal and financial work.

    The mass line is the Party's fundamental political and organizational line. Not only revolutionary struggles must launch mass movements, but economic construction must also launch mass movements. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Organizing the strength of the masses is a policy. Is there any policy opposite to this? Yes. That is, the lack of mass viewpoint, not relying on the masses, not organizing the masses, not paying attention to organizing the broad masses of rural areas, troops, government agencies, schools, and factories, but only paying attention to organizing a small number of people in financial agencies, supply agencies, and trade agencies; not regarding economic work as a broad movement, a broad front, but only as a temporary means to remedy insufficient finances. This is another policy, this is the wrong policy." Practice has proved that fiscal and financial work must launch mass movements. Only by launching mass movements can we truly serve production, promote the high-speed development of production, and continuously expand the source of funds and realize the high-speed accumulation of funds.

    The development of the entire leap forward situation promoted the leap forward of fiscal and financial work; the leap forward of fiscal and financial work, in turn, adapted to and promoted the continuous leap forward of various departments of the national economy. In the past two years, the mass movement in Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments has been further developed under such a situation. This movement started from within the fiscal and financial departments and gradually expanded into a mass movement that combined internal and external efforts and carried out large-scale cooperation. The movement has become more and more extensive and in-depth, creating a new, lively, and vibrant situation in fiscal and financial work that has never been seen before.

    To realize the Great Leap Forward in fiscal and financial work, we must mobilize the broad masses of our departments and fully mobilize their enthusiasm. The mass movement in fiscal and financial departments must be carried out around the goal of serving production under the premise of comprehensively strengthening the political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint. Only by firmly establishing the three major viewpoints can we achieve the goal of serving production, support and promote the high-speed development of production, and make the mass movement in fiscal and financial departments not only develop rapidly, but also have rich content. If the mass movement is simply for completing economic indicators, rather than being closely combined with the three major viewpoints, such a mass movement lacks political content, not only is the movement not easy to carry out well, but also the indicators are difficult to complete. This has been proved by the facts of the past two years. Secondly, the mass movement in fiscal and financial departments must seize the advanced, establish models, and launch a large-scale red flag competition movement. Experience has proved that the red flag competition movement is a good form of launching mass movements in fiscal and financial departments. It is conducive to maintaining the vigorous momentum of the movement at all times and organizing the vast majority of the masses into the movement under the common goal of serving production. At the same time, putting forward competition slogans, competition goals, and competition conditions in a certain period, and establishing a group of red flag units through comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, and then launching another movement by taking advantage of the situation can make the movement move forward wave after wave.

    To do a good job in fiscal and financial work, it is definitely not enough to mobilize only the masses in our own departments. This is because fiscal and financial work is related to various links such as production, circulation, and distribution. In particular, the funds of fiscal and financial departments not only come from production departments and are created by production departments, but are also used by production departments to serve production. Therefore, we must combine the mass movement of our departments with the mass movement of other relevant departments from the inside out. This is not only conducive to the continuous development of the mass movement in our departments, but also conducive to the in-depth development of the mass movement in relevant departments.

    The internal and external combination of the mass movement in Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments starts with economic activity analysis, and based on production needs, carries out "linking up" and "bridging" to organize cooperation in all aspects and help factories and enterprises exchange what they have and adjust each other. With the continuous leap forward in production, many problems need to be solved within a larger scope of cooperation. Therefore, the form of internal and external combination of the mass movement is also constantly developing, from individual cooperation of "linking up" and "bridging" to "three-line cooperation" of finance, finance, and production departments under the unified leadership of the district committee, and from "three-line cooperation" to comprehensive large-scale cooperation within a district, in which finance, finance, production, transportation, science and technology departments, and all factories participate. With the expansion of the scope of cooperation, the content of cooperation becomes more and more abundant, and the problems solved become more and more numerous, from the exchange of raw materials to the mutual support of technical equipment and labor, the exchange of experiences in technical innovation and financial management, and so on. For example, the district-wide comprehensive cooperation in Yangshupu District, including finance, finance, and enterprises, had solved a total of 958 key production problems by mid-February 1960. Among them, 651 items belong to raw material allocation, 19 items of fuel support, 43 items of tool and equipment borrowing, 54 items of technical labor support, 137 items of production and processing, 21 items of transportation, and 33 other items. While large-scale cooperation is developing rapidly, the internal and external mass movement of the fiscal and financial departments is also gaining momentum, with more and more people participating, which supports enterprises in completing and overfulfilling production plans, and also mobilizes relevant departments to work together to do a good job in fiscal and financial work. Some leading cadres of factories said: "In the past, financial and banking personnel only asked about finance when they entered the door, but now they ask about production first, and try their best to serve production, which gives us a great impetus." Financial and banking cadres also said: "The direction of large-scale cooperation is correct, the situation is opened, more and more work is done, the road is getting wider and wider, and the enthusiasm is getting stronger and stronger." This shows the great significance of mutual cooperation, mutual reliance, and common promotion of production.

    The internal and external mass movement of the fiscal and financial departments is not only expanding in scale, but also promoting the fiscal and financial work to be more meticulous and in-depth, especially promoting the development of mass-based team accounting in factories and enterprises, closely combining professional accounting with mass-based team accounting, and advancing the economic accounting work to a new stage. Team accounting is a new form of workers participating in management. Workers are direct participants in production. They know the most about the manpower and material resources required for each product, as well as how to save manpower and material resources. Therefore, the participation of workers in accounting and cost management can closely combine accounting work with the production process, make professional accounting have a reliable foundation, and make the entire accounting work better serve production. At the same time, team accounting also breaks the mysterious concept of economic accounting, indicating that economic accounting is just a tool to reflect and promote production in the form of currency, and is not something out of reach; it proves that even such meticulous work as economic accounting can only be done well by adopting the method of mass movement. After economic accounting adopted the mass movement method, it spread at an unprecedented speed. Among all the central factories and independent factories in the city, less than 30% implemented team accounting in the first half of 1959, and by the end of the year, it had developed to 95% of the enterprises implementing team accounting to varying degrees. The vigorous development of mass-based team accounting has made economic accounting work go out of the scope of departments, from the specialized business of a few people to a mass work that everyone participates in and cares about, thereby greatly enhancing the mass foundation of fiscal and financial work.

    Relying on the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in fiscal and financial work.

    The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in all work. Fiscal and financial work is a complex work with strong policies, and it is closely related to socialist construction and the vital interests of the broad masses of people. Therefore, it is both economic work and political work. Firmly relying on the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, firmly establishing the political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, fully mobilizing the masses, launching mass movements, and resolutely implementing the Party's general line are the fundamental guarantees for doing a good job in fiscal and financial work.

    The Party's general line is the lighthouse that illuminates all work and the fundamental line for the people of our country to build socialism. Like other work, fiscal and financial work follows the general line and is bound to achieve victory; leaving the general line will surely make mistakes. Therefore, fiscal and financial workers should be resolute executors of the general line.

    Firmly establishing the political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint is the fundamental problem for cadres in fiscal and financial departments to implement the general line. It should be recognized that fiscal and financial workers must have a political viewpoint. And the political viewpoint must be closely combined with the production viewpoint and the mass viewpoint. Implementing the Party's general line in the period of socialist construction is the main content of the political viewpoint, and the soul of the general line is the high-speed development of production. Therefore, fiscal and financial work must consider problems and arrange work from the perspective of being conducive to the high-speed development of production. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the three major viewpoints of fiscal and financial cadres have been generally strengthened, but not everyone has firmly established them. Some people, on the one hand, admit that fiscal and financial work must start from production and serve production, but in actual business work, they often start purely from funds, and even regard some practices of actively participating in production as "not doing their job properly" and "meddling in other people's business." These ideas are obviously wrong. In the past two years, Shanghai's fiscal and financial departments have improved the understanding of cadres in the continuous struggle with these wrong ideas, and gradually consolidated their viewpoint of serving production, changed their work style, and made Shanghai's fiscal and financial work make much greater achievements than in the past under the central task of serving production.

    To do a good job in fiscal and financial work, should we rely on a few people or the majority; should we rely solely on professional departments or everyone should work together? This is a question of the method of implementing the general line, and it is also a question of policy. It must be clear that in fiscal and financial work, funds are certainly very important, but the decisive factor is still people, the strength of the masses. Only by fully mobilizing the masses and continuously boosting revolutionary vigor can we do a good job in fiscal and financial work and better implement the Party's general line. After two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, there are now no people who openly oppose the mass movement in fiscal and financial work, but there are still people who have various doubts about the mass movement. Some people still believe that "mass movements in fiscal and financial departments will violate the requirement that economic work becomes more and more meticulous." They regard mass movements as crude, as booming, and as shouting, and do not see that mass movements themselves are meticulous work. The facts of the mass movement in the past two years have proved that if fiscal and financial departments do not launch mass movements, people can only sit in the office and read reports and use abacuses; if they launch mass movements on a large scale, people will go out of the office, go deep into enterprises, go deep into workshops, and go deep into teams and groups, observe, study, and analyze the use of funds from the production process, discover contradictions in the work, and figure out ways to reduce costs and save funds, and the work will inevitably become more and more meticulous. Some people also think that "fiscal and financial work can complete the task without launching mass movements." In a sense, this seems to make sense, but there are two different methods of completing the task: one is to rely on the majority and follow the mass line; the other is to rely on a few people and use administrative work methods. Two different methods will inevitably have two different results. If we rely on a few people and rely on administrative work methods to complete the task, its effect will definitely not be better than relying on the majority and following the mass line, and may even get the opposite result. The Great Leap Forward in Shanghai's fiscal and financial work in 1958 and 1959 was precisely the result of launching mass movements on a large scale. It would not have been possible to achieve such achievements without launching mass movements.

    The mass movement in fiscal and financial departments must combine vigorously with conscientiously. If it is only vigorous and does not talk about conscientiously, the mass movement is easy to become a formality; if it is only conscientiously and does not talk about vigorously, the mass movement lacks momentum. First of all, we should emphasize vigorously. Only on the basis of vigorously and conscientiously guiding the movement forward can the mass movement develop healthily. To achieve the combination of vigorously and conscientiously, the key lies in the Party's centralized leadership. Experience has proved that after a vigorous mass movement, it is inevitable that some problems will arise, but the main and large number of problems always reflect the good experience of the wisdom and creativity of the masses. Therefore, as long as we combine centralized leadership with launching mass movements on a large scale and summarize experience in a timely manner, the movement will inevitably develop healthily and continuously.

    The practice of the past two years tells us that as long as we hold high the red flag of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, resolutely implement the policies and guidelines of the Party and Chairman Mao on fiscal and financial work, firmly rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, launch mass movements on a large scale, thoroughly oppose rightism, and boost our energy, then fiscal and financial work will definitely be able to make greater contributions in the great cause of high-speed development of socialist construction.

    财政金融工作促进生产的道路
    中共上海市委书记处书记　曹荻秋
    财政金融工作，是经济战线上一个重要的组成部分，把这部分工作做好，不仅可以增加积累，活跃市场，而更重要的是可以促进生产高速度的发展。上海市的财政金融工作，在1958年、1959年两年大跃进中，通过伟大的群众实践，找到了社会主义财政金融工作为生产服务的广阔的道路，因而更加显示出它在促进生产高速度发展方面越来越大的作用。
    财政金融工作的根本任务，是从生产出发促进生产的高速度发展
    在国民经济各部门有机联系的整体中，生产是最根本的。它是财政金融工作的基础。因为只有生产发展了，经济繁荣了，资金的源泉才能扩大，积累才能增加。所以，毛主席早在1934年就指出：“从发展国民经济来增加我们财政的收入，是我们财政政策的基本方针。”他又在1942年指出：“发展经济，保障供给，是我们的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。”“财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济。”毛主席这一经济政策思想是马克思列宁主义在我国经济建设中的具体运用和发展。我们党几十年来所领导的财政经济工作，特别是大跃进以来的财政经济工作，无可争辩地证明了这一思想的无比正确和强大威力。正是在这一思想的指导下，我们的财政经济工作不断地取得了伟大的胜利。
    在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，上海如同全国一样，实现了国民经济的连续大跃进。1958年工业产值比1957年增长50．2％，1959年又在1958年大跃进的基础上增长43．3％。生产的大跃进带来了财政金融的大跃进，使上海的财政收入和银行存款都有了大幅度的增长。1958年财政收入比1957年增长60％，1959年又比1958年增长44％；财政和企业的存款也分别上升了46．1％和29．2％。这种增长速度是前所未有的。财政收入和银行存款的高速度增长又有力地支持了生产的进一步飞跃发展。1958年财政支出比1957年增长241．7％，1959年又比1958年增长29．3％；银行放款也分别上升了43．9％和58．8％。实现了“多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设”的方针。这些事实证明，生产的高速度发展，决定了财政金融的高速度发展；财政金融的高速度发展，反过来又成为推动生产发展的一个重要力量。
    从生产出发，促进生产的高速度发展，是财政金融工作的根本任务。根据两年来的实践，财政金融工作促进生产的道路是十分宽广的，办法也是很多的。财政金融部门是综合性的业务部门，它和生产、流通、分配都有极其广泛、密切的联系。因此，了解情况比较全面，掌握资料比较丰富，反映问题比较及时。只要善于利用综合部门这个特点，运用自己的业务工具，财政金融部门就可以从多方面为生产服务，充分发挥促进生产的积极作用。上海财政金融部门促进生产的办法，主要是深入企业，通过经济活动分析，对生产（包括产量、质量、成本）、物资、资金等方面的各种经济指标进行排队，从计划与实绩、本期与上期、工厂与工厂、车间与车间、班组与班组之间的分析对比中，找出先进与落后的差距，发现问题，根据不同情况，采取不同措施。当某些企业在生产发展过程中发生主要原材料不足，呆滞物资较多，影响生产正常进行的时候，财政金融部门一方面根据生产需要，及时主动地供应资金，一方面积极帮助企业清理物资，挖掘潜力，健全制度，加强原材料管理，提高经营管理水平。当某些企业在生产发展过程中，发生原材料、设备和劳动力不足以及某些技术问题，既不是企业本身、又不是财政金融部门所能解决的时候，财政金融部门就运用联系面广的有利条件，采取“挂钩”、“搭桥”、“穿针引线”等办法，在企业之间组织协作。当个别协作不能适应生产高速度发展需要的时候，就推动组织全面大协作；在更大范围内沟通有无，互相支援，作为国家计划平衡的补充。为了使所有企业都能增加生产，降低成本，加速资金周转，提高劳动生产率，财政金融部门就积极推动企业加强经济核算，大搞群众性的班组核算，把班组核算和比、学、赶、帮的群众运动密切结合起来，把专业核算和群众性的班组核算密切结合起来，调动广大工人群众的积极性，促进企业以最少的人力、物力、财力创造出更多的物质财富。上海财政金融部门就是在党委统一领导下，通过上述这些办法和措施，积极为高速度发展生产服务的。其结果，发扬了各个部门、各个企业之间的共产主义协作精神，共同努力，克服了生产发展过程中某些暂时的困难，推动了落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进；既实现了生产的大跃进，也实现了财政金融工作的大跃进，胜利地完成和超额完成了财政金融工作的任务。例如：1959年在杨树浦区委直接领导下，进行了全区性的包括财政、银行和全区企业在内的全面协作。这种协作的结果，使原来完成国家计划有困难的三十个企业，一般提前二至六天完成了国家计划，二十项重点产品胜利过关，十一项出口产品也保证完成任务，二十六项高尖产品及新产品的试制顺利进行，同时也有力地支持了技术革新、技术革命的开展。全区工业生产四季度比三季度增长25％，利润增加32％，税收增长26％，流动资金周转率加速22．2％，信贷资金下降3．4％。
    上海的财政金融部门就是通过深入生产、参与生产、促进生产的一系列的活动，一方面促进了生产的发展，一方面体现了财政信贷的监督作用。实践证明，为生产服务和实行财政信贷监督，是没有矛盾的。只要这种监督是从关心生产出发，从热情帮助出发，并且采取正确的措施，那末，这种监督就是完全必要的，也是企业所需要的。因此，只要真正做好了为生产服务的工作，也就必然做好了监督工作。
    大搞群众运动，内外结合，各方协作，是做好财政金融工作的关键
    群众路线是党的根本的政治路线和组织路线，不仅革命斗争要大搞群众运动，经济建设也要大搞群众运动。毛主席指示我们：“把群众力量组织起来，这是一种方针。还有什么与此相反的方针没有呢？有的。那就是缺乏群众观点，不依靠群众，不组织群众，不注意把农村、部队、机关、学校、工厂的广大群众组织起来，而只注意组织财政机关、供给机关、贸易机关的一小部分人；不把经济工作看作是一个广大的运动，一个广大的战线，而只看作是一个用以补救财政不足的临时手段。这就是另外一种方针，这就是错误的方针。”实践证明，财政金融工作必须大搞群众运动。也只有大搞群众运动，才能真正做到为生产服务，促进生产的高速度发展；才能不断扩大资金来源，实现资金的高速度积累。
    整个跃进形势的发展，促进了财政金融工作的跃进；财政金融工作的跃进，又适应和促进了国民经济各部门的不断跃进。两年来，上海财政金融部门的群众运动，就是在这样的形势下进一步开展起来的。这个运动从财政金融部门内部开始，逐步扩大到内外结合、大搞协作的群众运动。运动一步步广泛，一步步深入，使财政金融工作出现了从来没有过的生动活泼、朝气蓬勃的新局面。
    要实现财政金融工作的大跃进，必须把本部门的广大群众发动起来，把他们的积极性充分地调动起来。财政金融部门的群众运动，必须在全面加强政治观点、生产观点和群众观点的前提下，围绕着为生产服务的目标来进行。只有牢固地树立了三大观点，才能实现为生产服务的目标，支持和促进生产的高速度发展，使财政金融部门的群众运动既能迅速展开，又具有丰富的内容。如果大搞群众运动单纯为了完成经济指标，而不是与三大观点紧密地结合起来，这样的群众运动就缺乏政治内容，不但运动不易搞好，而且指标也难完成。这是两年来的事实所证明了的。其次，财政金融部门的群众运动必须抓先进，树标兵，大搞红旗竞赛运动。经验证明，红旗竞赛运动是在财政金融部门中大搞群众运动的一个良好形式，它有利于使运动经常保持轰轰烈烈的声势，在为生产服务的共同目标下，把绝大多数群众组织到运动中来。同时，在一定时期提出竞赛口号、竞赛目标和竞赛条件，通过比、学、赶、帮，树立一批红旗单位，乘势再发动一次，就能使运动一浪赶一浪地不断前进。
    要把财政金融工作做好，仅仅把本部门的群众发动起来，肯定还是不够的。这是因为财政金融工作关系到生产、流通和分配等各个环节，特别是财政金融部门的资金既是来自生产部门，是生产部门创造的；又是由生产部门使用，为生产服务的。因此，必须从内到外，把本部门的群众运动和其他有关部门的群众运动紧密结合起来。这样，既有利于本部门群众运动的持续开展，又有利于有关部门群众运动的深入发展。
    上海财政金融部门群众运动的内外结合，是从经济活动分析着手，根据生产需要，进行“挂钩”、“搭桥”，组织各方协作，帮助工厂企业互通有无，互相调剂。随着生产的不断跃进，有许多问题需要在更大的协作范围内求得解决，因此，群众运动内外结合的形式也不断发展，由“挂钩”、“搭桥”的个别协作，发展到在区委的统一领导下，财政、金融和生产部门的“三线协作”，又从“三线协作”进一步发展到在一个区的范围内，财政、金融和生产、交通、科技等部门以及全部工厂都参加的全面大协作。随着协作范围的扩大，协作的内容越来越丰富，解决的问题越来越多，从原材料的互通有无发展到技术设备、劳动力的互相支援、技术革新和财务管理工作的经验交流等等。例如：杨树浦区全区性的包括财政、金融以及企业在内的大协作，到1960年2月中旬止，共解决九百五十八项生产关键问题。其中属于原材料调拨的六百五十一项，燃料支援十九项，工具设备借用四十三项，技工劳动力支援五十四项，生产加工一百三十七项，运输二十一项，其他三十三项。与大协作迅速发展的同时，财政金融部门内外结合的群众运动，声势也越来越大，参加的人数也越来越多，既支持了企业完成和超额完成生产计划，又发动了有关部门大家动手，共同办好财政金融工作。有些工厂领导干部就说：“过去财政银行人员进门只问财务，现在进门先问生产，千方百计为生产服务，给我们很大的推动。”财政银行干部也说：“大协作方向对头，局面打开，工作越作越多，路子越走越宽，劲头越干越足。”这说明了相互协作，相互依靠，共同促进生产的重大意义。
    财政金融部门内外结合的群众运动，不仅在规模上不断扩大，而且推动了财政金融工作更加细致深入，特别是推动了工厂企业中群众性班组核算的开展，把专业核算和群众性的班组核算密切结合起来，把经济核算工作推进到一个新的阶段。班组核算是工人参加管理的一种新形式。工人是生产的直接参加者，他们对每种产品所需要的人力、物力，以及如何节约人力、物力的使用，是最了解，也是最关心的。因此，由工人群众参加核算，参加成本管理，就能使核算工作密切结合生产过程，使专业核算有了可靠的基础，使整个核算工作能更好地为生产服务。同时，班组核算也打破了对经济核算的神秘观念，说明了经济核算不过是运用货币形式来反映和促进生产的一种工具，并不是什么高不可攀的东西；证明了即使像经济核算这样细致的工作，也只有采取群众运动的方法才能搞好。经济核算采取了群众运动的方式以后，就以一种空前未有的速度推广开来。全市所有的中心厂、独立厂中，1959年上半年实行班组核算的还不到30％，到年底，已发展到95％的企业在不同程度上实行了班组核算。群众性班组核算的蓬勃开展，使经济核算工作走出了科室范围，从少数人员的专管业务变成大家动手、大家关心的群众性工作，从而大大增强了财政金融工作的群众基础。
    依靠党的领导，是做好财政金融工作的根本保证
    党的领导，是一切工作取得胜利的根本保证。财政金融工作是一项复杂的政策性很强的工作，它与社会主义建设和广大人民的切身利益休戚相关。所以，它既是经济工作，又是政治工作。紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，牢固地树立政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，这是做好财政金融工作的根本保证。
    党的总路线是照耀一切工作的灯塔，是我国人民建设社会主义的根本路线。财政金融工作与其他工作一样，遵循着总路线前进，就必然取得胜利；离开了总路线，就一定会犯错误。所以，财政金融工作者，应当是总路线的坚决执行者。
    牢固地树立政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，是财政金融部门干部贯彻执行总路线的根本问题。应当认识，财政金融工作者必须有政治观点。而政治观点又必须与生产观点、群众观点密切结合起来。在社会主义建设时期贯彻执行党的总路线，就是政治观点的主要内容，而总路线的灵魂又是高速度发展生产。所以，财政金融工作必须从有利于高速度发展生产出发来考虑问题，安排工作。在两年大跃进中，财政金融干部的三大观点普遍加强了，但是，并不是所有的人都牢固地树立了起来。有的人一方面承认财政金融工作必须从生产出发，为生产服务，但是在实际业务工作中，却常常单纯从资金出发，甚至对积极参与生产的一些做法看作是“不务正业”和“多管闲事”。这些思想显然是错误的。两年来，上海财政金融部门就在不断同这些错误思想的斗争中提高了干部的认识，逐步巩固了他们为生产服务的观点，转变了他们的作风，使上海的财政金融工作在为生产服务的中心任务下做出了比过去大得多的成绩。
    要做好财政金融工作，究竟是依靠少数人，还是依靠多数人；单纯依靠专业部门，还是依靠大家动手呢？这是贯彻执行总路线的方法问题，也是方针问题。必须明确，在财政金融工作中，资金固然是非常重要的，但是决定的因素仍然是人，是群众的力量。只有把群众充分发动起来，不断鼓足革命干劲，才能做好财政金融工作，才能更好地贯彻执行党的总路线。经过连续两年的大跃进，现在公开反对财政金融工作必须大搞群众运动的人是没有了，但是对群众运动持有各种各样疑虑的人还是有的。有人仍然认为“财政金融部门搞群众运动会违反经济工作愈做愈细致的要求”。他们把群众运动看成是粗枝大叶的，是轰，是大呼隆，没有看到群众运动本身就是细致的工作。两年来群众运动的事实证明，财政金融部门不搞群众运动，人们就只好坐在办公室看报表，打算盘；大搞了群众运动，人们便走出办公室，深入企业，深入车间，深入班组，从生产过程中观察、研究、分析资金使用情况，发现工作中的矛盾，摸出降低成本、节约资金的门道，工作就必然愈做愈细致。还有人认为，“财政金融工作不搞群众运动也可以完成任务”，这在某种意义上说，似乎也有道理，但是完成任务有两种不同的方法，一种是依靠多数人，走群众路线的方法；一种是依靠少数人，用行政工作的方法。两种不同的方法，必然有两种不同的结果。如果依靠少数人，依靠行政工作的办法去完成任务，它的效果肯定不会比依靠多数人、走群众路线的方法来得好，甚至还会得到相反的结果。1958、1959两年上海财政金融工作的大跃进，正是大搞群众运动的结果。不搞群众运动要取得这样的成就是不可能的。
    财政金融部门的群众运动，必须轰轰烈烈与踏踏实实相结合。只有轰轰烈烈而不讲踏踏实实，群众运动就容易流于形式；只有踏踏实实而不讲轰轰烈烈，群众运动就缺乏声势。首先应当强调轰轰烈烈，只有在轰轰烈烈的基础上踏踏实实地指导运动前进，才能使群众运动健康地发展。要做到轰轰烈烈与踏踏实实相结合，关键在于党的集中领导。经验证明，轰轰烈烈的群众运动起来之后，难免会出现一些问题，但是主要的、大量的总是反映群众的智慧和创造的好经验。因此，只要把集中领导与大搞群众运动结合起来，及时总结经验，运动就必然会健康地、持续地发展下去。
    两年来的实践告诉我们，只要我们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，坚决贯彻执行党和毛主席关于财政金融工作的政策方针，紧紧地依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，反透右倾、鼓足干劲，那末，财政金融工作就一定能在高速度发展社会主义建设的伟大事业中作出更大的贡献。
