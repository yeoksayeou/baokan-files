Promote Communist Style
Zhang Ke

The communist style is a characteristic of the Mao Zedong era. In every unit, in every production and construction undertaking, examples of this style, such as mutual support and cooperation, and voluntary labor, are everywhere. The news published in today's newspaper about advanced communes and teams in Datong County, Qinghai, and Wuzhong City, Ningxia, allocating manpower and materials to help communes and teams with difficulties in spring plowing is one example of promoting the communist style on the agricultural production front.

The communist spirit of collaboration, after the realization of the people's communes, has increasingly become a style of the broad masses of the people and a new standard of social morality. Leaving difficulties to oneself and making things convenient for others is a concentrated expression of this style. This is the result of the Party's education and cultivation, and also the social ideology that is inevitably produced by the advanced social system of the people's commune. A commune includes dozens of former advanced cooperatives. Within such a large scope, the production conditions and material foundations of each unit are not completely the same; some are better, some are worse. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the spirit of collaboration, with the advanced helping the backward and those with good conditions helping those with poor conditions. Because people know that if the production of backward units is not improved, it is not only a problem for these units themselves, but also a problem for the entire commune and even related to socialist construction.

Collaboration is not limited to the advanced helping the backward, and it is not only the units with poor conditions that receive help; backward units also have the obligation and possibility to help advanced units. In such a large people's commune, coupled with the implementation of zoned planting of various crops, there will inevitably be differences in sowing time, with some earlier and some later, and some idle and some busy at the same time. Through mutual assistance and cooperation, it is possible to fully tap labor potential and solve the contradiction of insufficient labor during the busy farming season. This is beneficial to all units.

Promoting the communist style and engaging in large-scale mutual assistance and cooperation does not mean that the principle of mutual benefit can be abandoned. The principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit should be observed throughout the entire socialist stage; but this does not mean advocating haggling over labor remuneration. We are communists, and our goal is communism. In order to realize the grand ideal of communism, we should cultivate new communist factors in all aspects, especially in political and ideological aspects, during the period of building socialism. It is obvious that if we do not cultivate a communist labor attitude and promote the communist style while implementing distribution according to work, not only will there be a lack of political and ideological foundation for the future transition to communism, but it will also be detrimental to the current socialist construction. Therefore, greatly promoting the communist style, extensively carrying out the cooperation movement, advocating and establishing a moral fashion of acting bravely for a just cause among units and among the working people, leaving difficulties to oneself, and sending convenience to others, so that everyone regards helping others as their bounden duty, is a very important task for Party organizations at all levels. Only by completing this task well can the flowers of communist cooperation bloom everywhere.

    发扬共产主义风格
    张克
    共产主义风格是毛泽东时代的特征。在每一个单位里，在每一项生产建设事业中，代表这种风格的如互相支援和协作、义务劳动等，到处皆是。今天本报发表的青海大通和宁夏吴忠两县市的先进社、队抽出人力物力帮助有困难的社、队进行春耕生产的消息，便是农业生产战线上发扬共产主义风格的一例。
    共产主义的协作精神，在实现人民公社化以后，日益成为广大人民的一种风格，日益成为一种新的社会道德标准。把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，就是这种风格的集中表现。这是党的教育和培养的结果，也是人民公社这个先进的社会制度所必然产生的社会意识形态。一个公社包括了几十个过去的高级社，在这样大的范围内，各单位的生产条件和物质基础是不完全相同的，有的好些，有的差些，这样就必须发扬协作精神，先进的帮助落后的，条件好的帮助条件差的。因为人们知道：如果落后单位的生产搞不好，不单是这些单位本身的问题，也是全公社以至与社会主义建设有关系的问题。
    协作不限于先进帮助落后，不光是对条件差的单位有帮助，落后单位对先进单位也有帮助的义务和可能。在这样大的人民公社里，再加推行了各种作物分区种植，在播种时间上必然有先有后，在同一时间内必然有闲有忙，通过互助协作，就可以充分挖掘劳动潜力，解决农忙时劳力不足的矛盾。这对所有单位都是有好处的。
    发扬共产主义风格，大搞互助协作，并不是说可以放弃互利原则。等价互利的原则在整个社会主义阶段都应该遵守；但这并不是提倡斤斤计较劳动报酬。我们是共产主义者，我们的奋斗目标是共产主义，为了实现共产主义的远大理想，我们在建设社会主义的时期，就应该在各方面，尤其是在政治思想方面培植新的共产主义的因素。事情很明显，在目前实行按劳分配的时候，如果不培养共产主义的劳动态度，不发扬共产主义风格，不仅将来向共产主义过渡缺乏政治思想基础，而且对当前社会主义建设也不利。因此，大大发扬共产主义风格，广泛开展协作运动，在各单位之间，在劳动人民之间，提倡和树立见“义”勇为的道德风尚，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，从而使每一个人都把帮助别人看成是自己的应尽的义务，是各级党组织一个非常重要的任务。这个任务完成得好才能使共产主义协作之花开遍各地。
