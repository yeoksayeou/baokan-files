Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 24th: TASS reports that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev had a busy day of visits in Paris on the 23rd.

　　In the morning, Khrushchev visited French President de Gaulle. They held talks at the Élysée Palace. During the meeting, Khrushchev presented de Gaulle with a replica of the Soviet lunar rocket insignia and a model of the photographic apparatus that photographed the far side of the moon as gifts.

　　In the afternoon, Khrushchev laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Afterwards, accompanied by French government officials, Khrushchev paid his respects at Fort Mont-Valérien on the outskirts of Paris. During World War II, the Hitlerite bandits who occupied France turned Mont-Valérien into a killing ground for French patriots and resistance fighters. Many participants in the French Resistance and representatives of veterans' organizations lined up inside the fortress, carrying flags and wearing combat medals, and silently mourned with Khrushchev.

　　Later, Khrushchev received a delegation from the France-USSR Association headed by General Petit at his residence. He also received a delegation of supporters of the French peace movement headed by Delavigne, and a delegation from the French Parliament that visited the Soviet Union in 1956. During the conversations, Khrushchev emphasized the traditional friendship existing between the peoples of France and the Soviet Union, and stressed the importance of the struggle for peace at the present time.

　　In the evening, de Gaulle held a banquet to welcome Khrushchev and the members of the Soviet delegation. De Gaulle and Khrushchev delivered speeches at the banquet.

　　In his speech, Khrushchev expressed the hope that the visit to France would promote the development of cooperation and friendship between the Soviet Union and France, and would further enhance mutual understanding between the two countries on major international issues of common concern.

　　He said, we believe that the Soviet Union and France can find a common ground on the fundamental issue of safeguarding peace in Europe.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that in France, people are aware of the danger of revanchism, and the Soviet Union and France may be able to adopt a common attitude in dealing with this issue. He said that it is necessary to eliminate the remnants of World War II and conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

　　Khrushchev also pointed out that the potential for trade and cultural cooperation between the two countries is far from being exhausted.

    以后，赫鲁晓夫在住所里接见了以柏蒂将军为首的法苏协会代表团。他还接见了以德拉维热里为首的法国和平运动拥护者代表团，和1956年访问过苏联的法国议会代表团。赫鲁晓夫在谈话时着重指出存在于法苏两国人民之间的传统友谊，并且强调争取和平的斗争在目前所具的重要性。
    晚间，戴高乐举行宴会欢迎赫鲁晓夫和苏联代表团成员。戴高乐和赫鲁晓夫在宴会上互相致词。
    赫鲁晓夫在致词中表示希望，对法国的访问，将会促进苏联和法国之间的合作和友谊的发展，将会使两国在共同关心的重大的国际问题上进一步了解。
    他说，我们认为，在保卫欧洲和平的根本问题上，苏联和法国可以找到共同的基础。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在法国，人们考虑到复仇主义的危险的存在，苏、法两国有可能在处理这个问题上采取共同的态度。他说，必须消除第二次世界大战的残迹和缔结对德和约。
    赫鲁晓夫还指出，两国之间贸易和文化合作的潜在可能性远远没有用尽。
