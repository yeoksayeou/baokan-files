Last winter, we traveled from Beijing to Santiago, Chile, taking over 60 hours by plane, traversing over 22,000 kilometers, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and passing the Equator. It was quite a long journey. This trip was undertaken by Chinese women representatives for the sake of peace, friendship, and the pursuit of knowledge. We stayed in Santiago for two weeks and received warm hospitality and care from the Chilean people, leaving us with unforgettable impressions.

Chile, a country known as the "edge of the earth" with beautiful scenery, is famous throughout the world for its copper mines. In Santiago, we could see the brilliance of copper everywhere. The main street in Santiago is named after Chile's national father, O'Higgins. Every so often, one can see a finely crafted commemorative bronze statue. In particular, the heroic bronze statue of the Chilean national hero O'Higgins riding a horse and wielding a war sword to kill the enemy is vividly portrayed. We also saw copper basins, copper pots, copper cups, copper smoking sets... all kinds of utensils and exquisite toys displayed in the stores. We saw various copper plates with carvings of portraits, landscapes, and ethnic dance patterns, as well as Chile's national flower in red, adorning the walls of many homes as decorations and works of art. There were also various novel and unique copper handicrafts, showcasing the diligence and wisdom of the Chilean working people.

Chile is a country that relies on copper exports for its livelihood, and the Chilean people are quite proud of their rich copper deposits. However, the rights to exploit and export this valuable metal are controlled by the United States. The majority of Chile's annual production of 500,000 tons of copper is shipped to the United States, leaving only a small amount of 80,000 tons for Chile's own use. The price of copper is also kept very low, which has caused Chile's economic situation to deteriorate severely, and the working people bear the burden of unemployment and rising prices. It is said that of the approximately one million workers in Chile, 250,000 are unemployed, accounting for a quarter, which is one of the root causes of the hardships in the lives of the Chilean people. Many people live in extreme poverty and starvation.

Recently, U.S. imperialism has been putting pressure on Chile to buy or lease its oil mines. This has further aroused widespread anti-American sentiment among the Chilean people. Currently, the Chilean people are carrying out a movement to oppose the sale of national resources and protect oil resources. When we were staying in Santiago, a leader of the Chilean Women's Federation, Marieta Campushano, was sentenced and prepared to be forcibly detained in the south for 541 days. She was convicted because she criticized the country's economic policies at a mass rally. Now, many prominent figures and mass organizations are supporting her, and the Chilean Women's Federation has also sent a delegation to appeal to the government and the public, demanding the reversal of the sentence.

Chile is a resource-rich country, and the Chilean people also have a glorious tradition of opposing imperialism and striving for national independence. In the historical museum, we saw the heroic struggles of the Chilean people who persisted for more than 300 years against the rule of Spanish colonialism.

Now the Chilean people are carrying out a movement to protect oil. They have shown high morale and firm confidence, just as a lawyer said: "We must protect national resources, and one day, these resources will truly belong to the Chilean people."

When we arrived in Chile on November 22, 1959, the Chilean Women's Federation had just convened the first Latin American Women's Congress. Hundreds of representatives from fifteen Latin American countries attended the congress. This was a major event in the political activities of women in Latin American countries to defend peace, strive for and maintain national independence, and oppose imperialism. We felt very sorry that we missed the conference. However, because the conference had just concluded, we still had the opportunity to meet and contact representatives from various countries, world peace fighters, and social activists who attended the conference.

We received warm hospitality on Chilean soil, and the Chilean people gave us very valuable friendship. From the day we arrived in Chile, apart from four or five hours of rest each night, we spent two weeks either being visited by Chilean friends at the hotel, or being invited by these friends to attend tea parties, cocktail parties, and receptions. The friends who came to visit us at the hotel were in a constant stream. Some were familiar friends who had visited China in the past, and it was especially cordial to meet again this time; some were unfamiliar friends who took the initiative to introduce themselves as having visited China in a certain year and month, and then took out photos of themselves with Chinese friends, revealing infinite affection for China; there were also some friends who had met the Chinese art troupe here in the past, who also came to greet us with great enthusiasm. Among the invitations from Chilean friends, many were invitations to the host's own home, where we gathered with the men, women, old, and young of the host's family, chatting to our hearts' content, and it was very intimate. On the very first day, we were guests at the home of Mr. Allende, a Chilean senator, honorary chairman of the Chilean-Chinese Cultural Association, and one of the leaders of the Socialist Party. His living room displayed various Chinese carvings, porcelain, and many other handicrafts, as well as Chinese calligraphy and paintings, as if we had come to a small Chinese arts and crafts exhibition hall.

Mr. Martinez Campos, chairman of the Chilean-Chinese Cultural Association and a member of the Radical Party, has visited China twice. He told us that the number of people advocating Chilean-Chinese friendship is increasing day by day. When the People's Republic of China celebrated its tenth anniversary, more than sixty celebrations were held throughout Chile, the largest of which was held in Santiago, with more than six thousand people participating.

Friendship, Peace! Chile (Chali), China (Chana)! Many friends in Santiago were pleased that the names of the two countries were somewhat similar in sound, and they affectionately said that this was a symbol of brotherly countries.

The friendship between the Chinese and Chilean people is like the seawater of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which has linked the people of Latin America and the 650 million people of China together.

    在铜的故乡
    罗叔章
    去年冬天，我们从北京到智利圣地亚哥，坐飞机坐了六十多小时，飞越了二万二千多公里的路程，横渡大西洋，穿过了赤道，可算是一次遥远的旅行。这次旅行正是中国妇女代表为了和平，为了友谊，为了寻求知识而去的。我们在圣地亚哥住了两个星期，受到了智利人民的热情招待和亲切关怀，给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    智利这个号称“地球边缘”的、有着绮丽风光的国家，是以出产铜矿著名于世的，在圣地亚哥我们到处可以看到铜的光辉。在圣地亚哥最主要的一条街道，是以智利国父奥里金斯命名的，每隔不远，就可以看到一座精工细琢的纪念铜像，其中特别是智利民族英雄奥里金斯骑在马上，拿着战刀杀敌的英勇铜像，神色栩栩如生。我们还看到商店里陈列着铜盆、铜壶、铜杯、铜烟具……各种日用器皿以及精巧的玩具。看到许多家庭里墙上挂的装饰品和艺术品有各式各样的铜盘，上面有的雕着人像、风景、民族舞蹈图案，还有红色的智利国花。更有各种新颖别致的铜制的手工艺品，显示了智利劳动人民的勤劳和智慧。
    智利是依靠输出铜为生的国家，智利人民也颇以蕴藏丰富的铜矿而自豪。但是这宝贵金属的开采和出口权，却控制在美国手里。智利每年出产的五十万吨铜，绝大部分都运到美国去，只留下微少的八万吨归智利自己使用。铜的价格又被压得很低，这造成智利的经济情况非常恶化，劳动人民背负着失业和物价不断上涨的重担。据说，智利工人约一百万，失业的达二十五万，占四分之一，这是造成智利人民生活困苦的根源之一。很多人生活在极端贫困、饥饿的状态中。
    最近美帝国主义又在对智利施加压力，要收买或租借智利的石油矿。这更激起了智利人民普遍的反美情绪。现在，智利人民正在开展反对出卖国家资源，保卫石油资源的运动。当我们在圣地亚哥停留的时候，智利妇联的一位领导人马丽叶塔·康普沙诺正被判刑，准备强迫拘留在南部五百四十一天。她被判的罪名是因为在一次群众集会上，她抨击了本国的经济政策。现在很多的知名人士和群众团体声援她，智利妇联也派出一个代表团，向政府和社会人士呼吁，要求撤销判决。
    智利是资源丰富的国家，智利人民也有着反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的光荣传统。我们在历史博物馆里，看到智利人民为反对西班牙殖民主义的统治坚持了三百多年的英勇斗争的事迹。
    现在智利人民正在开展保卫石油的运动。他们表现了昂扬的斗志和坚定的信心，正像一位律师讲的：“我们要保卫民族资源，总有一天，这些资源会真正为智利人民所有。”
    我们在1959年11月22日到达智利时，智利妇联刚召开过首次拉丁美洲妇女代表大会。出席大会的有十五个拉丁美洲国家的几百名代表。这是拉丁美洲各国妇女保卫和平、争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的政治活动中的一件大事。我们没有赶上大会，感到十分惋惜。但是，因为大会刚刚闭幕，我们还有机会分别会晤和接触到出席这次大会的各国代表、世界和平战士和社会活动家。
    我们在智利国土上受到了热情的款待，智利人民给了我们很可贵的友谊。从我们到达智利那天起，除了每晚四、五小时的休息之外，两个星期的时间，不是智利朋友来旅馆访我们，就是我们被这些朋友们邀请去参加茶会、酒会和招待会。到旅馆来访我们的友人川流不息。有的是过去访问过中国的熟识朋友，这次重新见面，分外亲切；有的是不相识的朋友，他们主动自我介绍哪年哪月访问过中国，接着就拿出和中国朋友合照的照片，对中国流露出无限的感情；还有些是中国艺术团过去在这里结识的朋友，也殷勤备至地来打招呼。在智利朋友们的邀请中，有很多是被邀请到主人自己家里，和主人家里的男女老幼，聚在一起尽情畅谈，非常亲热。刚到的头一天，我们在智利上议员、智中文协名誉主席、社会党领导人之一阿伦德先生家作客。他家客厅陈列着中国的各种雕刻、瓷器和许多其他手工艺品，还有中国字画，俨然像是来到一个小型中国工艺美术展览馆。
    智中文协主席马丁奈斯·康普斯先生是激进党的议员，曾两度访问过中国。他告诉我们，主张智中友好的人正在一天天增加。中华人民共和国建国十周年时，智利全国曾举行了六十多次庆祝活动，其中最大的一次是在圣地亚哥举行的，有六千多人参加。
    友谊，和平！智利（Chali），中国（Chana）！圣地亚哥很多的朋友都以两个国家的国名有些音韵相近而高兴，他们亲切地说这是兄弟国家的象征。
    中国智利人民的友谊好像大西洋、太平洋的海水一样，它们已经把拉丁美洲人民和中国六亿五千万人民联系在一起了。
