Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: Building and installation enterprises across the country are vigorously promoting a complete set of advanced experiences centered on rapid construction. Practice in various regions has proven that by adopting this set of experiences, the construction period can generally be shortened by more than half compared to using ordinary methods, and the quality of the project is good. The Ministry of Construction believes that the widespread promotion of this set of experiences across the country will provide an important guarantee for the continued leap forward in the construction industry.

This set of rapid construction experience was gradually created and accumulated by the masses of workers and staff in the great leap forward over the past two years. It includes experiences in increasing the degree of prefabrication and assembly, implementing mechanized and semi-mechanized construction, promoting a complete line of tool innovation, strengthening construction preparation, organizing rapid completion, implementing unified on-site command (project queuing, force allocation, material supply, etc.), and closely organizing three-dimensional cross-operation and parallel flow operation.

Due to the active promotion by construction departments in various regions, the number of projects adopting rapid construction is constantly expanding. According to recent statistics from twenty-two provinces and cities including Shanghai, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan, and units directly under the Ministry of Construction, the area under rapid construction has averaged 57% of the total construction area, and some provinces and cities have reached more than 80%.

Rapid construction requires rapid preparation, rapid construction, rapid installation, and rapid completion throughout the entire construction process, accelerating from beginning to end, link by link. Rapid construction methods such as prefabrication and assembly, overall hoisting, and three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operation in civil engineering and installation work have gradually developed into regular construction methods widely used on many construction sites. While adopting these methods, construction sites across the country, combined with the mass movement to vigorously develop advanced tool sets and march towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, have further developed the rapid construction experience. For example, the Shanghai Fifth Construction Company, in the process of carrying out large-scale rapid construction, created a "hoisting assembly line" that connects a series of processes, from lifting floor slabs, horizontal ground transportation, vertical transportation to high altitude, and horizontal transportation at high altitude to complete installation, using a combination of indigenous and foreign-made tools to form a continuous flow line. This not only solved the problem of insufficient large cranes in rapid construction, but also greatly accelerated the project progress compared to using large cranes, reducing the time required to install a floor slab from the previous three or four days to one shift to one and a half shifts.

In order to meet the needs of rapid construction, design departments in various regions are also vigorously promoting the experience of rapid and high-quality design. The experience of rapid and high-quality design includes mobilizing the masses to collectively create design plans, vigorously carrying out competitions and evaluations, as well as improving design methods and promoting design standardization, calculation tabulation, and drawing assembly. Units that have promoted these experiences have achieved significant results in a very short period of time. For example, the Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute, the Glass Industry Design Institute, and the Cement Industry Design Institute have completed their first quarter plans ahead of schedule and in excess. The Liaoning Provincial Design Institute completed its annual workload 318 days ahead of schedule.

In terms of construction deployment, various regions are actively adopting the method of engineering queuing under the unified leadership of the local Party committee. This method requires all construction enterprises to uniformly supply building materials and equipment, uniformly allocate labor, and concentrate the use of manpower and materials according to the queuing order, completing one project before starting another. Practice has proven that this method is the most effective measure to ensure the rapid completion of projects. In terms of industrial construction, in order to ensure that factories can be put into production in batches, various regions have also created the experience of carrying out construction in batches according to the needs of production technology in the process of promoting the engineering queuing experience. For example, the No. 3 Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, which undertook the construction of the nitrogen fertilizer plant, insisted on dividing the entire project into five systems, including air separation, gas production, synthesis, methanol, and ammonium nitrate, according to the production line, and organized concentrated efforts in batches, enabling the plant to be put into production one and a half years ahead of schedule.

In addition, many experiences that promote rapid construction, such as implementing a one-man leadership system on construction sites, adhering to the combination of vigorous mass movements and centralized management in on-site management, vigorously carrying out diversified operations in construction and installation enterprises, and implementing an investment contract system in construction finance, are also being actively promoted in various regions.

### 快准备　快施工　快安装　快结尾　加快建设速度  各地广泛推行快速施工

    快准备　快施工　快安装　快结尾　加快建设速度
    各地广泛推行快速施工
    据新华社24日讯　全国建筑安装企业正在大力推广以快速施工为中心的一整套先进经验。各地实践证明，采用这套经验，比用普通方法施工，工期普遍可以缩短一半以上，而且工程质量良好。建筑工程部认为，全国各地普遍推广这套经验，将为建筑工业继续跃进提供重要保证。
    这套快速施工经验是职工群众在两年来的大跃进当中，逐步创造和积累起来的。它包括提高预制装配程度、实行机械化半机械化施工、推广机具革新一条龙的经验、加强施工准备工作、组织快速结尾、实行工地的统一指挥（项目排队、力量调配、物资供应等）、严密地组织立体交叉和平行流水作业等内容。
    由于各地建筑部门积极推行，采用快速施工的工程在不断扩大。据上海、辽宁、山东、四川等二十二个省市和建筑工程部直属单位最近的统计，实行快速施工的面积平均已占施工总面积的57％，有的省市达到80％以上。
    快速施工要求整个施工过程中快准备，快施工，快安装，快结尾，从头到尾、环环加快。土建、安装工作中的预制装配、整体吊装和立体交叉平行流水作业法等快速施工方法，已经逐步发展成为许多工地普遍采用的经常性施工方法。全国各地建筑工地在采用这些方法的同时，结合大搞先进机具配套成龙、向机械化和半机械化进军的群众运动，从而使快速施工经验有了进一步的发展。例如，上海市第五建筑公司在进行大面积快速施工的过程中，创造了“吊装一条龙”，把楼板起吊、地面水平运输、垂直运输到高空、高空水平运输直到安装完毕一连串的过程，用土洋结合的机具联结起来，形成一条没有间歇的流水线，不仅解决了快速施工中大吊车不足的问题，而且比用大吊车还大大加快了工程进度，安装一层楼板所用的时间由以前的三、四天缩短到一班到一班半。
    为适应快速施工需要，各地设计部门也正在大力推行快速优质设计的经验。快速优质设计的经验，包括发动群众集体创作设计方案，大搞竞赛评比，以及改进设计方法，推行设计标准化、计算表格化、制图装配化等内容。推行这些经验的单位，在很短的时间内就收到了显著的效果。例如东北工业建筑设计院、玻璃工业设计院和水泥工业设计院已经提前超额完成了第一季度的计划。辽宁省设计院提前三百一十八天完成了全年工作量。
    在施工部署方面，各地都在积极采用在当地党委统一领导下进行工程排队的办法。这个办法要求各个建筑企业根据排队次序，统一供应建筑材料和设备，统一调配劳动力，集中使用人力、物力，搞完一个工程，再搞一个。实践证明：这个办法是保证工程迅速完工的最有效的措施。在工业建筑方面，为保证工厂能够分批投入生产，各地在推行工程排队经验的过程中，还创造了按生产工艺需要进行分批施工的经验。如建筑工程部第三工程局承建的氮肥厂，由于坚持按生产线把整个工程分为空气分离、造气、合成、甲醇和硝氨等五个系统，分批组织突击，使这个厂提前一年半投入了生产。
    此外，像建筑工地上实行一元化领导，工地管理方面坚持大搞群众运动和集中管理相结合、建筑安装企业中大搞多种经营，建筑财务方面实行投资包干制度等促进快速施工的许多经验，也正在各地积极推行。
