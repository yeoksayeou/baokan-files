Xinhua News Agency, 26th: China's cultural relics and museum undertakings have experienced a vigorous new situation of great development, great popularization, and great improvement in the ten years since the founding of the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. They have also begun to form their own unique national style, becoming a powerful weapon for the Party to conduct propaganda and education and ideological struggle on the ideological front.

In terms of museums, there are now more than 600 specialized, local, and memorial museums (exhibition halls) above the county level across the country, which is more than eight times that of 1957. Exhibition halls, exhibition rooms, and exhibition activities below the county level are almost universal in every people's commune, every administrative district, and production team, forming a preliminary national museum and exhibition hall network. Since 1958, with the vigorous development of the Great Leap Forward in production and the people's communes, various localities, under the direct leadership of the Party committees, have successively held thousands of "Contrast Between the Past and Present," "Technical Innovation," "Great Achievements of the Decade," and "Three Decades" exhibitions. These exhibitions timely coordinated with the central tasks, powerfully publicized the Party's policies and Mao Zedong Thought, reflected the face of the Great Leap Forward, and promoted advanced technologies and experiences. They have played a huge role in promoting the in-depth development of socialist and communist ideological education and the technological revolution. Many people in various regions praised, "If you want to become a versatile person, take a walk in the museum," and "The exhibition hall is a treasure trove, strong in both industry and agriculture. Whoever goes in to take a look will have their superstitious thoughts swept away." After cadres and masses in Taihe County, Anhui Province, watched the on-site tool reform competition exhibition, they immediately launched a high tide of tool reform throughout the county. Within two months, they imitated and reformed more than one million pieces of various new-style tools, greatly accelerating the early completion of water conservancy projects. The masses who participated in various exhibitions successfully applied folk songs, paintings, ballads, handicrafts, and other forms popular with the masses to the exhibitions, thus greatly enriching the forms of exhibitions, strengthening the propaganda effect, and possessing a strong local color and national style. Since the Great Leap Forward, many large museums have also broken with conventions, going to the mountains and the countryside, and delving into factories and mines to conduct extensive mobile exhibitions. For example, museums in Beijing held a total of 58 types of mobile exhibitions, with 2.5 million visitors, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held more than 30 types of mobile exhibitions, with 2.5 million visitors. These mobile exhibitions not only expanded the scope of the audience but also strengthened ties with the masses. Because the museum undertaking resolutely implemented the Party's general line for building socialism, adhered to serving politics and production, and implemented the policy of walking on two legs, it has become increasingly rich and colorful in content and form, presenting a prosperous scene, and is increasingly widely welcomed by the audience. According to incomplete statistics, in 1958, the number of visitors to museums and exhibition halls above the county level (excluding commune and team exhibition halls and rooms) in the country was more than 200 million, an increase of more than 18 times compared with 1957.

The rapid completion in less than a year of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Museum of Chinese History, the Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution Military, and the National Culture Palace Museum is a concentrated expression of the Great Leap Forward in the cultural relics and museum undertaking. Not only is the speed of construction unprecedented, but the ideological, scientific, and artistic qualities of the displays and exhibitions have also reached an unprecedentedly high level.

In terms of cultural relics work, in the past ten years, extensive surveys, collections, and protection work have been carried out on revolutionary cultural relics. In particular, in 1958, a high tide of widely collecting revolutionary cultural relics from cities to the countryside was formed throughout the country. During the preparation for the construction of the Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution Military, a mass movement was vigorously launched. In just three or four months, nearly one million pieces of cultural relics and photos from various revolutionary periods were collected. In terms of protecting revolutionary sites, 358 important sites have been identified as cultural relics protection units, and 56 have been renovated. Museums or memorial halls have been established at famous revolutionary sites such as the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, Jinggangshan, Ruijin, and Yan'an. At present, from the Opium War to the Xinhai Revolution, from the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China to the founding of the People's Republic of China, important revolutionary sites representative of various revolutionary periods have been preserved.

Another important aspect of cultural relics work is to cooperate with the magnificent economic construction and carry out large-scale archaeological excavation work in various construction projects. According to incomplete statistics, 316 ancient cultural sites and 23,102 ancient tombs have been excavated, and a large number of precious historical cultural relics from the Paleolithic Age to the Yuan and Ming Dynasties have been unearthed, greatly enriching the research materials of historical culture. New supplements and new examples have been provided to China's unwritten history and the history of human development in the world. In particular, since 1958, a more comprehensive cultural relics census and review work has been carried out. At the same time, training classes have been widely held throughout the country to popularize cultural relics knowledge and excavation technology, forming a widespread mass movement to protect cultural relics. A powerful amateur cultural relics work force of the working people has emerged. In Henan Province alone, more than 2,600 mass cultural relics workers have been trained in the past two years. Counties, cities, and people's communes with a large number of historical cultural relics have their own excavators, and 25 amateur excavation teams have been established; More than 2,800 mass cultural relics protection groups have been established.

In addition, in the past ten years, more than 1,000 ancient buildings have been discovered in the cultural relics census, 640 ancient buildings have been repaired, and more than 800,000 pieces of scattered bronzes, calligraphy and paintings, sculptures, etc., and more than 1.8 million volumes of ancient books have been collected.

The Party's leadership and putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for the leap-forward development of China's cultural relics and museum undertaking. In the past few years, the Party and the government have issued a series of cultural relics protection laws, instructions, and other documents, and have established specialized institutions for the protection of cultural relics at the central and local levels, and have carried out many specific tasks. In the process of building the Museum of the Chinese Revolution and the Museum of Chinese History, in addition to appointing personnel to form a preparatory leading group, the Party Central Committee also gave timely and clear instructions in all aspects from political ideology, guiding principles and policies to display forms. The preparatory display work of museums in various localities was also personally led by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels. Due to the improvement of the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of the people, many people have donated precious cultural relics and books that they have painstakingly collected throughout their lives or passed down from their ancestors to the state. In the ten years of liberation, Beijing has received 41 more important donations from the masses, totaling 3,848 pieces. In the half-year after November 1958, the masses in various parts of Anhui Province contributed more than 80,000 revolutionary cultural relics.

The leap-forward development of the cultural relics and museum undertaking is also the result of giving full play to communist large-scale collaboration. The construction and display work of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution and the Museum of Chinese History has been supported by more than 1,000 units across the country. Many museums have sent their "top-notch" cultural relics to the two museums. Museums in Beijing and Shanghai have also supported museums in other places with a large number of cultural relics. Museums in various provinces have provided assistance in various aspects to county-run exhibition halls and exhibitions. This kind of communist large-scale collaboration has promoted the leap-forward development of China's cultural relics and museum undertaking.

    大发展　大普及　大提高
    我国文物博物馆事业出现繁荣局面
    新华社26日讯　我国文物、博物馆事业，建国十年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，出现了蓬蓬勃勃大发展、大普及、大提高的新局面，并且开始形成自己的独特民族风格，成为党在思想战线上进行宣传教育和理论斗争的有力武器。
    在博物馆方面，目前全国县以上的专门性、地志性、纪念性等各类博物馆（展览馆）已达六百多个，相当于1957年的八倍多，县以下的展览馆、展览室和展览活动，更是几乎普及到每一个人民公社、每一个管理区和生产队，初步形成了全国的博物馆展览馆网。1958年以来，随着生产大跃进和人民公社的蓬勃发展，在各地党委直接领导下，纷纷举办了成千上万的“今昔对比”、“技术革新”、“伟大十年成就”和“三个十年”等展览会，及时配合中心任务，有力地宣传了党的方针政策和毛泽东思想，反映了大跃进的面貌，推广了先进技术和经验，对于促进社会主义、共产主义思想教育和技术革命的深入展开，发挥了巨大的作用。很多地区的群众称赞说：“要想成为多面手，博物馆里走一走”，“展览馆是万宝囊，工业农业样样强，谁要进去看一看，迷信思想一扫光”。安徽省太和县的干部和群众看过工具改革现场比武展览后，立即在全县范围内掀起了工具改革运动的高潮，两个月内就仿制和改制成各种新式工具一百多万件，大大加速了水利工程的提前完成。广大群众参加举办的多种多样的展览会，成功地把群众自己喜闻乐见的民歌、绘画、说唱、手工艺品等运用到展览中，从而大大丰富了展览的形式，加强了宣传效果，而且具有浓厚的地方色彩和民族风格。大跃进以来，许多大型的博物馆也打破陈规，上山下乡、深入厂矿，进行了广泛的流动展览。如北京各博物馆共举办流动展览五十八种，观众达二百五十万人次，内蒙古自治区共举办三十多种流动展览，观众达二百五十万人次。这种流动展览，既扩大了观众的范围，又密切了同群众的联系。由于博物馆事业坚决贯彻了党的建设社会主义总路线，坚持为政治、为生产服务，实行两条腿走路的方针，因而从内容到形式都日益丰富多彩，呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象，而且愈来愈广泛地受到了观众的热烈欢迎。据不完全的统计，1958年全国县以上博物馆、展览馆（不包括社、队展览馆、室）的观众为两亿多人次，比1957年增加十八倍多。
    中国革命博物馆、中国历史博物馆、中国人民革命军事博物馆、民族文化宫博物馆不到一年时间即迅速建成，是文物博物馆事业大跃进的集中表现，不仅建馆速度是史无前例的，而且陈列展览的思想性、科学性、艺术性也达到了前所未有的高度水平。
    文物工作方面，十年来，对革命文物进行了广泛的调查、征集和保护工作。特别是1958年在全国范围内形成了一个从城市到农村广泛征集革命文物的高潮，中国人民革命军事博物馆在筹建过程中，大搞群众运动，仅三、四个月的时间，就征集到各个革命时期的文物、照片近百万件。在保护革命遗址方面，已经确定为文物保护单位的重要遗址有三百五十八处，经过修缮的有五十六处。著名的革命遗址如上海党的第一次代表大会会址、井冈山、瑞金、延安等地都建立了博物馆或纪念馆。目前从鸦片战争到辛亥革命，从党的第一次代表大会到中华人民共和国的成立，各个革命时期都保存了具有代表性的重要革命遗址。
    文物工作的另一个重要方面，是配合宏伟的经济建设，在各项建设工程中进行了大规模的考古发掘工作。据不完全的统计，已经发掘古文化遗址三百一十六处、古墓葬二万三千一百零二座，发掘出从旧石器时代直到元、明的大量珍贵历史文物，极大地丰富了历史文化的研究资料。把我国没有文字记载的历史，把世界人类发展史都作了新的补充和提供了新的例证。特别是1958年以来，进一步进行了全面的文物普查复查工作，同时，全国各地大办训练班、普及文物知识和发掘技术，已经形成了广泛的群众保护文物运动。涌现出声势浩大的劳动人民的业余文物工作队伍。仅河南一省，两年来已经训练了两千六百多名群众文物工作者，历史文物众多的县、市和人民公社，都有自己的发掘员，已经成立了二十五个业余发掘队；建立了两千八百多个群众性文物保护小组。
    此外，十年来还在文物普查中发现了古代建筑一千余处，修缮了古建筑六百四十处，收集了流散的铜器、书画、雕刻等八十多万件和古旧图书一百八十多万册。
    党的领导、政治挂帅，是我国文物、博物馆事业获得飞跃发展的根本保证。几年来，党和政府颁发了一系列的文物保护法令、指示等文件，在中央和地方设置了保护文物的专门机构，而且进行了许多具体工作。在中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆的建馆过程中，党中央除指定人员成立筹建领导小组外，并从政治思想、方针政策到陈列形式等各方面都及时地给予明确的指示。各地博物馆的筹建陈列工作也都是由各级党委书记亲自挂帅进行的。由于广大人民群众思想觉悟的提高，很多群众纷纷把毕生辛勤收集或祖辈相传的珍贵文物图书捐献给国家。北京市在解放十年中，收到群众较重要的捐献就有四十一起、三千八百四十八件。安徽省各地群众在1958年11月以后的半年内就献出革命文物八万余件。
    文物、博物馆事业的飞跃发展，也是发挥共产主义大协作的结果。中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆的建馆和陈列工作，得到了全国各地一千多个单位的支援，很多博物馆都是把“拔尖子”的文物送给了两个博物馆。北京、上海的博物馆也以大批的文物支援了外地的博物馆。各个省博物馆对县办的展览馆和展览会都从各方面进行了帮助。这种共产主义的大协作，促进我国文物、博物馆事业的飞跃发展。
