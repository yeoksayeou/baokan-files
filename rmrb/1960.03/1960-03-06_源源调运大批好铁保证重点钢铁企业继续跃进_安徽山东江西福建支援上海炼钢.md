Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 5th. Steel plants in Anhui Province are linking up with iron-using units in Shanghai and other places, establishing fixed supply relationships, and further improving the work of transporting pig iron to support Shanghai and other regions.

The establishment of factory-to-factory links and fixed supply relationships was proposed as Anhui Province's iron and steel industry continues to grow and strengthen. This year, Shanghai's steel and casting industries are developing towards multiple varieties, precision, and cutting-edge technologies, which requires pig iron supplying units to further improve the quality of pig iron and supply it according to the required varieties and specifications. In the two years of continuous leap forward, Anhui Province's small blast furnaces have been continuously consolidated and improved, with steadily increasing quality and output. Therefore, they are in a position to produce according to the varieties and specifications required for steelmaking and casting, providing the possibility for universal implementation of factory-to-factory links and fixed supply with Shanghai and other regions. Their specific approach is: pig iron from Hefei and Huainan steel plants is fixedly supplied to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Mechanical Bureau; pig iron from Wuhu, Anqing, and Ma'anshan steel plants is fixedly supplied to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, Shanghai Electric Machinery Bureau, and Mechanical Bureau.

The implementation of factory-to-factory links and fixed supply relationships has played a certain role in promoting high-quality and high-yield production for both parties. In January and February of this year, Anhui Province has transferred 248,000 tons of pig iron to support key enterprises in Shanghai and other places, an increase of 76.7% compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 5th. Shandong Province is promoting the spirit of cooperation, adhering to the principle of "prioritizing external needs over internal needs," and overfulfilling the task of outward transfer of pig iron in the first two months of this year. In the past two months, the province has transferred more than 190,000 tons of pig iron to support steelmaking needs in Shanghai and other places, with the outward transfer volume increasing by more than 150% compared to the same period last year.

The relevant leading departments in Shandong Province have always regarded the task of transferring pig iron to support Shanghai and other places as an extremely glorious task. In addition to taking measures to improve the production and quality of pig iron as a prerequisite for ensuring the completion of the outward transfer task, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Bureau, Railway Bureau, Transportation Command and other units have also formed a joint office under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee to specifically lead the outward transfer of pig iron, ensuring daily arrangements and constant inspections, ensuring both quality and quantity, and striving for balanced outward transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 5th. Jiangxi Province is seizing the time to transfer pig iron to support Shanghai steelmaking. In the first two months of this year, the amount of pig iron transferred to Shanghai reached more than 22,000 tons, a sharp increase of more than two times compared to the same period last year; the quality has also greatly improved compared to last year.

In order to complete the task of pig iron transfer on time, with good quality and quantity, Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead to strengthen supervision and leadership, and promptly helped solve problems. The First Secretary of the Fenyi County Party Committee, upon discovering that pig iron was piling up near Fenyi Railway Station and could not be loaded and transported in time, immediately led cadres and workers from county-level organs to rush to transport and load the vehicles, loading more than 390 tons of pig iron on February 27 alone.

In the pig iron transfer, the steel plant workers and masses in various places promoted a high degree of communist style, doing everything possible to give priority to supporting Shanghai with the best pig iron they produced; at the same time, they adopted the method of producing and transporting simultaneously to ensure that the pig iron supporting Shanghai was quickly transported to the railway line. In order to support key steel enterprises in steelmaking, the province's workers also did everything possible to save 8,000 tons of pig iron from their own use to support Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 5th. Fujian Province is promoting the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation and taking various effective measures to actively transfer pig iron to support Shanghai steelmaking. The province has completed the outward transfer plan for pig iron for the first two months of this year, and various factories are striving to complete the outward transfer task for the first quarter ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

Since Fujian Province undertook the task of supplying Shanghai with pig iron from the Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking in 1958, thanks to the attention of the Provincial Party Committee and relevant Party committees at all levels, the task of outward transfer of pig iron has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeding the target every quarter, achieving high quantity and quality, and has been praised by relevant iron-using departments. Their main approach is: Party committee secretaries at all levels personally take the lead to vigorously grasp the production and transfer of pig iron. Establish fixed supply bases, and designate the iron plants in Longyan and Nanping prefectures, which produce more and better iron and have more convenient transportation conditions, as pig iron production bases for transfer to Shanghai. Establish a unified command post to achieve a one-stop production and transfer process, with close integration in every aspect.

### 源源调运大批好铁保证重点钢铁企业继续跃进  安徽山东江西福建支援上海炼钢

    源源调运大批好铁保证重点钢铁企业继续跃进
    安徽山东江西福建支援上海炼钢
    新华社合肥5日电　安徽省各钢铁厂正在同上海等地用铁单位挂钩，固定供应关系，进一步作好调运生铁支援上海等地的工作。
    厂厂挂钩，固定供应关系，是在安徽省钢铁工业不断发展壮大的情况下提出来的。今年，上海的钢铁、铸造都是向多品种、精密、尖端发展，因此要求供应生铁单位更加提高生铁质量，并按所需要的品种规格供应。安徽省小高炉在两年持续跃进中，不断巩固提高，质量产量稳步上升，因此，有条件按炼钢、铸造要求的品种规格进行生产，为同上海等地普遍实行厂厂挂钩，固定供应提供了可能。他们的具体做法是：合肥、淮南钢铁厂的生铁，固定供应上钢一厂、上海机械局；芜湖、安庆、马鞍山钢铁厂的生铁，固定供应上钢三厂、上海电机局、机械局。
    实行厂厂挂钩，固定供应关系后，对促使双方共同实现优质高产起了一定的作用。今年1、2月份，安徽省已调出生铁二十四万八千吨支援了上海等地重点企业，比去年同期增长76．7％。
    据新华社济南5日电　山东各地发扬协作精神，坚持“先外后内”的原则，今年头两个月超额完成了生铁外调任务。两个月来，全省已经调出生铁十九万多吨，支援了上海等地炼钢需要，外调量比去年同期增加一倍半还多。
    山东省各有关领导部门把外调生铁支援上海等地的任务，一直当作一项极为光荣的任务来完成。各地除了采取措施提高生铁的产量、质量，作为保证完成外调任务的先决条件外，省冶金工业局、铁路局、运输指挥部等单位还在中共山东省委的领导下，组成了联合办公室，具体领导生铁外调工作，作到天天安排，时时检查，既保质保量，又力求均衡外运。
    据新华社南昌5日电　江西省抓紧调运生铁支援上海炼钢。今年头两个月内，调往上海的生铁达二万二千多吨，比去年同期猛增两倍以上；质量也比去年有很大的提高。
    为了按时按质按量完成生铁调运任务，各级党委书记挂帅，加强督促领导，及时帮助解决问题。中共分宜县委第一书记，发现分宜火车站附近积压生铁，不能按时装车外运，立即率领县直属机关干部和工人，前去抢运装车，仅2月27日一天就装车三百九十多吨生铁。
    在生铁调运中，各地钢铁厂职工群众发扬了高度的共产主义风格，千方百计地把自己生产的最好生铁尽先支援上海；同时采取边生产、边搬运的办法，保证把支援上海的生铁迅速运到铁路沿线。为了支援重点钢铁企业炼钢，全省职工还千方百计地从自用生铁中节约了八千吨，支援了上海。
    据新华社福州5日电　福建省发扬共产主义大协作精神，采取各种有效措施积极调运生铁支援上海炼钢。全省今年头两个月的生铁外调计划已经完成，各厂正在力争提前超额完成第一季度外调任务。
    福建省从1958年大炼钢铁运动起，担负供应上海生铁以来，由于省委和有关各级党委的重视，外调生铁任务季季都提前超额完成，做到量多质高，受到有关用铁部门的赞扬。他们的主要作法是：由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，大抓外调生铁的生产和调运工作。建立固定供应基地，把省内产铁又多又好和交通运输条件比较方便的龙岩、南平两专区的铁厂，划为调运上海的生铁生产基地。建立统一指挥部，做到生产、调运一条龙，环环密切结合。
