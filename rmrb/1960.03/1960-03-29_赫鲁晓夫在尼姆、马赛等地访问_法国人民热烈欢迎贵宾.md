Xinhua News Agency, March 28th – According to TASS: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage flew from Pau to Istres yesterday morning, and then drove to visit water conservancy and irrigation projects.

At the Biche pumping station, the Soviet people's representative was welcomed by the person in charge of this water conservancy project. After the tour, Khrushchev and his party continued their drive. When they passed through the small town of Saint-Gilles, the citizens came out in the pouring rain to welcome the head of the Soviet government.

Khrushchev then arrived in the city of Nîmes. The streets and central square of Nîmes were crowded with thousands of people. Slogans such as "Peace!" "Long Live French-Soviet Friendship!" and "Welcome Khrushchev!" could be seen everywhere. The rain, which had not stopped since early morning, could not dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. When the Soviet guests entered the prefectural government building, the cheers did not stop. Khrushchev went to the balcony to acknowledge the crowd's welcome.

Local authorities held a reception for the Soviet guests in the prefectural government building and hosted a luncheon for them. Khrushchev spoke at the luncheon. He emphasized the importance of strengthening Soviet-French friendship, a friendship cemented by the blood shed by the best sons and daughters of the two countries in the anti-fascist war.

After the luncheon, Khrushchev and his entourage continued their journey. That afternoon, they arrived in the ancient French city of Arles and visited the city before heading to Marseille.

That evening, Khrushchev and his entourage arrived in Marseille, the large port city in southern France.

The streets of Marseille were packed with people. Cheers erupted wherever the head of the Soviet government passed, as the French people expressed their sincere friendship with the Soviet people. The motorcade stopped in front of the provincial government building, where Khrushchev and his party had dinner and rested.

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Marseille – According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, who is visiting various provinces in France, visited Marseille this morning. Accompanied by two French government ministers, Jacquinot and Joxe, Khrushchev visited a kindergarten in Marseille. In the kindergarten, two four-year-old boys presented bouquets to Khrushchev and his wife.

When Khrushchev walked onto the street, the crowd, which had been standing outside the police cordon, burst into thunderous applause and cheers. Under the pressure of the crowd, the police cordon was broken, and everyone crowded closer to the car to welcome the head of the Soviet government.

Then, Khrushchev traveled by car to visit the Faculty of Medicine. Here, he was welcomed by the Mayor of Marseille, Defferre, a Socialist.

A guide told Khrushchev that the medical school had 2,800 students, 40% of whom were female. Khrushchev said that in the Soviet Union, female students accounted for 80% of medical students. The guide also said that 25% of the school's students received scholarships. Khrushchev said that France could not compare with the Soviet Union in this regard. In the Soviet Union, study and accommodation are free, and students also receive scholarships. After visiting the Faculty of Medicine, Khrushchev received a warm welcome from the citizens of Marseille as he got into the car. The motorcade drove to the Port of Marseille amidst cheers. The Soviet guests were welcomed at the port by representatives of the Supreme Military Command and members of the Marseille Parliament. The distinguished guests boarded a speedboat to visit the construction of the Port of Marseille.

    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员昨天上午乘飞机离波城前往依斯特尔，然后乘汽车前往参观水利灌溉工程。
    在比舍抽水站里，苏联人民的这位代表受到了这项水利工程的负责人的欢迎。参观完毕，赫鲁晓夫一行继续驱车前进。当他们通过圣日尔小城时，市民冒着大雨出来欢迎苏联政府首脑。
    赫鲁晓夫接着来到了尼姆城。尼姆城的大街和中心广场聚集了上千的人。到处都可以看到这样的标语：“和平！”“法苏友谊万岁！”“欢迎赫鲁晓夫！”。从清晨起一直未停的雨也不能降低群众的热情。当苏联贵宾走进省府大厦以后，欢呼声仍然没有停止。赫鲁晓夫到阳台上答谢群众的欢迎。
    地方当局在省府大厦为苏联贵宾举行了招待会，并且设午宴款待他们。赫鲁晓夫在午宴上讲了话。他强调指出加强苏法友谊的重要性，这种友谊是由两国人民最优秀的子弟在反法西斯战争中所流的鲜血凝结成的。
    赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员在午宴后继续他们的行程。当天下午，他们到达法国古老的城市阿尔，并且在参观了市容以后前往马赛。
    当天黄昏，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员到达法国南方的大港马赛。
    马赛的大街挤满了人。苏联政府首脑所过之处，欢呼之声不绝，法国人民表示同苏联人民真诚友好。车队开到省政府门前停下，赫鲁晓夫一行在这里进餐和休息。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社马赛讯：正在法国各省访问的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天上午在马赛参观。赫鲁晓夫在法国政府二位部长雅基诺和若克斯的陪同下，参观了马赛的一所幼儿园。在幼儿园里，两个四岁的小男孩向赫鲁晓夫和他的夫人献了花束。
    当赫鲁晓夫走到街道上时，一直站在警察警卫线外面的人群传出了暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。在人群的压力下，警察的警卫线被突破了，所有的人都挤近汽车跟前欢迎苏联政府首脑。
    然后，赫鲁晓夫乘车前往医学院参观。在这里，他受到马赛市长、社会党人德费尔的欢迎。
    一位讲解员告诉赫鲁晓夫，医学院有二千八百名学生，女学生占40％。赫鲁晓夫说，在苏联，医学院的女学生占80％。讲解员还说，该校有25％的学生领到助学金。赫鲁晓夫说，在这方面法国不能同苏联相比。在苏联学习和住宿都是免费的，同时学生还可以得到奖学金。在参观了医学院以后，赫鲁晓夫在上汽车时受到马赛市民热烈的欢迎。车队在欢呼声中驶往马赛港。苏联客人在港口受到最高军事指挥部代表和马赛议员们的欢迎。贵宾们登上快艇参观了马赛港的建筑。
