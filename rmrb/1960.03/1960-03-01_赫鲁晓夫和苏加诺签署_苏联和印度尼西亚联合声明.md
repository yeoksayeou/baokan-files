Xinhua News Agency, Bogor, 29th - According to TASS, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev and Indonesian Republic President Sukarno signed the Soviet-Indonesian Joint Statement, the Second General Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation, and the Cultural Cooperation Agreement in Bogor on February 28.

The Joint Statement, referring to the smoothly developing relations between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Indonesia, pointed out that "in this friendly relationship, the two governments firmly adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence based on non-interference in each other's internal affairs."

The statement said, "The Soviet government fully supports the principles of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in 1955."

The statement said, "The two governments reiterate that all manifestations of colonialism should be eradicated, and the eradication of such manifestations is in the interest of world peace. Therefore, the Soviet government fully supports the rights and claims of the Republic of Indonesia to West Irian. The two governments fully support the anti-colonialist struggle, which is developing particularly vigorously on the African continent. The two governments hope that all peoples will soon gain complete national independence, as national independence is an extremely important contribution to the cause of international peace."

The statement also said, "The Soviet government and the government of the Republic of Indonesia express the deep hope that the Soviet, American, and British conference on the cessation of nuclear testing currently being held in Geneva will soon reach a favorable agreement to promote further relaxation of international tensions. Such an agreement, and its implementation under effective international supervision, would be a major step in the cause of universal disarmament for the benefit of world peace." "The two governments believe that the support of the member states of the United Nations for the proposition of the rapid cessation of all nuclear weapons tests, as stated in the resolutions of the recent session of the United Nations General Assembly, is of great importance."

The statement said, "During the exchange of views, the issue of the upcoming summit conference in Paris was discussed. The government of the Republic of Indonesia expressed the hope that the summit conference could initiate the implementation of practical steps towards disarmament, as well as other efforts to ease international tensions and eliminate the Cold War. To this end, the government of the Republic of Indonesia declares its support for the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and hopes that this proposal can be realized. The government of the Republic of Indonesia considers the Soviet Union's initiative to reduce its armed forces by another 1.2 million men as a step towards achieving the aforementioned ideal."

The statement said, "The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the President of the Republic of Indonesia emphasized that any differences between countries should be resolved by peaceful means. They are convinced that no use of force or threat of force can solve international problems."

The statement said, "The Soviet and Indonesian governments agree that the summit conference to be held in Paris in May is only the beginning of a series of summit conferences, the purpose of which is not only to reach disarmament agreements, but also to seek and establish a healthier foundation for the entire international relations, so as to achieve progress and free the peoples of all countries from the threat of new wars."

The statement continued, "The two governments agree that important issues related to the maintenance of universal peace not only concern the four major powers, but also the interests of all other countries. Therefore, the two governments express the hope that future summit conferences held to resolve issues related to the fate of the world and the fate of all mankind will also include other countries, including those that are not members of existing military alliances (including the corresponding Asian and African countries) to participate in the discussion of the above issues."

The statement said, "The two governments believe that the neutral, active, and independent policy of not participating in military blocs is a positive contribution to easing international tensions and maintaining the cause of world peace." "To this end, the Republic of Indonesia reiterates that Indonesia firmly pursues its own active and independent foreign policy, a policy of not participating in existing military alliances. The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers declares that the Soviet people and government respect Indonesia's active and independent foreign policy, which is an important contribution to strengthening world peace."

The statement also discussed the issue of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The statement said that the two sides discussed plans regarding Soviet assistance to Indonesia and the provision of new loans to Indonesia to realize projects included in Indonesia's future overall development plan. An agreement was reached on a total loan amount of 250 million US dollars.

Khrushchev invited Sukarno to pay a friendly visit to the Soviet Union at his convenience, and Sukarno accepted the invitation.

    联合声明在谈到苏联和印度尼西亚共和国之间正在顺利发展着的关系时指出，“在这种友好关系方面，两国政府坚决奉行互不干涉内政的和平共处原则”。
    声明说，“苏联政府完全支持1955年在万隆举行的亚非国家会议决议的原则。”
    声明说，“两国政府重申，殖民主义的一切表现应当肃清，肃清这种表现是符合全世界和平利益的。因此，苏联政府完全支持印度尼西亚共和国对西伊里安的权利和要求。两国政府完全支持反殖民主义的斗争，这种斗争现在在非洲大陆得到特别蓬勃的发展。两国政府希望各国人民很快就能获得完全的民族独立，因为民族独立是对国际和平事业的极其重要的贡献。”
    声明又说，“苏联政府和印度尼西亚共和国政府表示深切希望，正在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英三国不继续核试验会议能够很快达成良好的协议，以促进国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。这样的协议以及它在有效的国际监督下的实施，将是在实行普遍裁军以有利于世界和平的事业中的一个重大步骤。”“两国政府认为，在联合国大会最近一届会议的决议中所表明的联合国成员国支持迅速停止一切核武器试验的主张，这是十分重要的。”
    声明说，“在交换意见过程中讨论了有关将要在巴黎举行的最高级会议的问题。印度尼西亚共和国政府表示希望，最高级会议能够开始使裁军方面的实际步骤以及缓和国际紧张局势和消除冷战方面的其他努力得到实现。为此印度尼西亚共和国政府声明，它支持苏联的全面彻底裁军建议，并且希望这个建议能够实现。印度尼西亚共和国政府认为苏联关于再次裁减军队一百二十万人的主动措施是达到上述理想的一个步骤。”
    声明说，“苏联部长会议主席和印度尼西亚共和国总统强调指出，国与国之间的任何分歧都应该用和平手段解决。他们确信，任何使用武力或武力威胁的手段都不能解决国际问题。”
    声明说，“苏联和印度尼西亚政府一致认为，将于5月在巴黎举行的最高级会议只是一系列最高级会议的开始，其目的不仅是为了达成裁军协议，而且也是为了寻求和确立整个国际关系的更加健康的基础，从而达到进步和使各国人民摆脱新战争威胁。”
    声明接着说，“两国政府一致认为，与维护普遍和平有关的重要问题不仅涉及到四个大国，而且也关系着所有其他各国人民的利益。所以两国政府表示希望，在以后为了解决同世界命运和全人类命运有关的问题而举行的最高级会议也将吸收其他国家，其中包括那些不是现存的军事联盟成员国（包括亚非相应国家）的国家参加讨论上述问题。”
    声明说，“两国政府认为，不参加军事集团的中立的积极的、独立的政策是对缓和国际紧张局势和维护全世界和平事业的积极贡献。”“为此，印度尼西亚共和国重申，印度尼西亚坚决奉行自己的积极独立的外交政策，不参加现有的军事联盟的政策。苏联部长会议主席声明，苏联人民和政府尊重印度尼西亚的积极的和独立的外交政策，这个政策是对加强全世界和平的重要贡献。”
    声明还谈到了两国之间的经济和文化合作问题。声明说，双方讨论了关于苏联帮助印度尼西亚和向印度尼西亚提供新的贷款以实现包括在印度尼西亚今后发展总计划中的项目的计划。双方达成协议，贷款总数为二亿五千万美元。
    赫鲁晓夫邀请苏加诺在他感到方便的时候到苏联进行友好访问，苏加诺接受了这个邀请。
