    A Day at the Communal Kitchen
    Li Desen, Yu Jingqi
    The bell of the communal kitchen awakens the commune members, who hurry out of bed and head towards the kitchen in the spring breeze. When we arrive, the members are already seated at the tables, large bowls of fresh vegetables and steaming rice emitting an enticing aroma, filling the entire kitchen with laughter and cheerful voices.
    This is an ordinary day in the spring plowing season at the Gu Xing People's Commune in Jiang'an County, Sichuan. The previous night, the production team cadres held a short meeting, deciding to advance the rice transplanting time by one solar term. Therefore, a concentrated effort would be launched the next day: to level all the rice paddies, complete one-third of the early rice sowing task, and apply 20,000 jin of fertilizer to each mu of rice paddy, reaching the requirement of 150,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. At the same time, 50 mu of paddy fields would be plowed for the fourth time. At the end of the meeting, the kitchen administrator stood up and said, "The kitchen is determined to leave its name on the glorious record of spring plowing production!" Following this, the kitchen staff held an emergency meeting, everyone expressing their determination to ensure that every commune member eats well and is well-fed during the spring plowing, feeling comfortable and energetic. They carefully arranged the existing grain and vegetable situation, ensuring three meals a day, two dry and one porridge, three dishes and one soup per meal. During the busy season, this would be changed to three meals of dry rice, five dishes per meal, and meals would be delivered to the fields.
    That night, at the second rooster's crow, the cooks got out of bed. Some cooked rice, some stir-fried dishes, and everything was prepared half an hour before mealtime. The commune members praised the rice as being neither too soft nor too hard; the sliced celtuce as being crisp and tender, and the lotus root as having added dried chili peppers... Commune member Li Changfu told us that he had never enjoyed such "blessings" in the past. His family of eight, with three laborers, used to be in chaos without a communal kitchen, their production and life in a mess. His wife couldn't manage both production and cooking, so they had to cook one meal in the morning and eat it all day, with two meals of cold rice. He felt lazy and inefficient in production, and couldn't finish a day's work in three days, always failing to go to work on time in the morning. Now that they have a communal kitchen, the whole family participates in production, eats on time, goes to work on time, feels relaxed, and wholeheartedly focuses on production.
    Before the morning glow had fully dissipated, the commune members went to work. The cooks began washing pots and dishes and boiling water. We followed the production team leader on a tour of the kitchen, where we saw more than forty pigs in the pigsty, all plump and healthy, and the vegetable garden run by the kitchen was lush green. Although there was a drought last year, the commune still had a good harvest. To help the commune members manage their lives in a planned way, the kitchen implemented a planned grain consumption system: eating more during the busy season, eating less during the slack season, combining coarse and fine grains, and balancing meals. The kitchen also provided special care for pregnant women and the elderly, providing them with more fine grains, meat, and fresh vegetables. The kitchen is also very clean, with bowls and chopsticks disinfected with boiling water, and tables and chairs spotless and neatly arranged.
    Three hours before mealtime, the cooks washed the rice and chopped the vegetables; then they delivered tea to the fields. We ran into squad leader Chen Ying leading some female commune members to deliver fertilizer to the rice paddies. These girls, who usually loved to sing and dance, carried loads of a hundred jin, each walking with swift strides. The rest bell rang, and the cooks shouted, "Rest, drink some boiled water before continuing!" The commune members took the boiled water handed over by the cooks, drank it down in one gulp, and thanked them repeatedly.
    Time is of the essence. Just as the commune members were working with great enthusiasm, night fell. At this time, the cooks, who had been busy all afternoon, carried buckets of boiled water to the eaves of the kitchen, set out basins, and waited for the commune members to return to wash their faces and feet. Large bowls of dishes: stir-fried greens, vinegar-flavored cabbage, mixed shredded radish, and spinach soup, were steaming hot on the table. The dinner bell was urging the commune members to enter the kitchen again.
    Now, it is a time of bright lights, laughter, and cheerful voices. The production team leader, who had been busy collecting statistics from various groups after work, came to the middle of the kitchen. He happily held a small piece of paper and announced the good news to everyone: today's production tasks have all been completed. In this way, the team's sowing tasks and early rice transplanting were basically guaranteed. Someone shouted loudly, "We should first send a big red announcement of victory to the kitchen!" Many commune members echoed, "The comrades in the kitchen have worked hard!"

    食堂一日
    李德森  于竞祁
    食堂的钟声，唤醒了社员，大家赶忙起床，迎着春天的微风，向食堂走去。当我们赶到食堂，社员们早已一桌桌的坐好了，大碗大碗的新鲜菜，热腾腾的米饭，散发出诱人的香气，整个食堂充满笑语欢声。
    这是四川江安县古兴公社春耕中普通的一天。头天夜里，生产队的干部们开了一个简短的会，决定把插秧时间提早一个节令，因此要在第二天开展一个突击运动：把秧田全部平好，完成三分之一的早稻播种任务，并且要给每亩秧田补下肥料二万斤，达到每亩有底肥十五万斤的要求，同时还要把五十亩水田犁完第四次。会议结束时，食堂管理员站起来说：“食堂立志要在春耕生产光荣簿上留个名。”接着，食堂工作人员开了一个紧急会议，大家表决心：一定要让每个社员在春耕中吃好、吃饱，身心舒畅，精力充沛。他们根据现有的粮食和蔬菜情况作了仔细安排，保证每天三餐，两干一稀，每餐三菜一汤，大忙季节改为三餐干饭，每餐五样菜，并且做到送饭下田。
    这一天晚上，鸡叫二遍，炊事员就起了床。做饭的做饭、炒菜的炒菜，开饭前半小时就把一切准备齐全。社员们夸奖说，大米饭不软不硬；青笋片又脆又酥，莲花菜里还加放了干辣椒……。社员李昌福告诉我们，他过去从来没有享过这样的“福”。他家八口人、三个劳动力，过去没有食堂，生产生活乱成一团。他的妻子顾了生产就顾不了煮饭，只好早晨煮一顿饭吃一天，其中有两顿要吃冷饭。生产懒心懒肠，一天的活三天也做不完，早上总是不能按时出工；现在办了食堂，全家参加生产，按时吃饭，按时出工，一身轻松，全心全意搞好生产。
    朝霞还未散尽，社员们就出工了。炊事员们开始刷锅洗碗、烧开水。我们随着生产队长在食堂巡礼一番，只见猪圈里四十多头猪长得肥头大耳，食堂经营的菜园一片碧绿。去年这里虽然遭受了干旱，但全社仍然获得丰收。为了帮助社员有计划地过日子，食堂实行了计划用粮制度，农忙多吃，农闲少吃，粗细搭配，饭菜搭配。对孕妇和老人，食堂也有专门照顾，供给他们较多的细粮、肉类和鲜菜。这个食堂还很清洁，碗筷都经过开水消毒，桌椅一尘不染，排列得整整齐齐。
    离开饭还有三个小时，炊事员就洗好米、切好菜；然后把茶水送到地边去。迎面碰上了小组长陈英带着一些女社员给秧田送肥，这些平常爱唱爱跳的姑娘们，挑起百斤重担，个个健步如飞。休息钟声响了，炊事员高叫起来：“休息了，喝点开水再干吧！”社员们接过炊事员递来的开水，一饮而尽，大家连声道谢。
    时间，分秒必争。社员们干活干得正起劲呢，夜幕降临了。这时，忙碌了一个下午的炊事员们，又把烧好的热水一桶桶地提到食堂的屋檐下边，摆好盆子，等社员们回来洗脸、洗脚。大碗大碗的菜：烩青菜、醋溜白菜，拌萝卜丝和菠菜汤，热气腾腾地摆在桌上。开饭的钟声又在催促着社员们走进食堂。
    现在，这里是灯火明亮、笑语喧哗的时刻了。收工后就忙着向各组统计数字的生产队长，这时来到食堂正中间。他高兴地拿着一张小纸条，向大家宣布胜利的消息：今天的生产任务样样都完成了。这样，全队播种任务、提前栽秧基本有了保证。不知哪一个人高声喊着：“要先给食堂送个大红喜报才对！”许多社员都附和着说：“辛苦了食堂的同志们！”
