A Little Experience in Implementing the Education Revolution in Music Education
Zhao Feng

In the past two years, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, and propelled by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the Central Conservatory of Music, like other music colleges across the country, has undergone revolutionary fundamental changes. On the basis of the victory of the Rectification Movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, an education revolution has been carried out, the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" has been implemented, the Party's leadership over school work has been established, the past situation of detachment from politics, detachment from the masses, detachment from tradition, and detachment from reality has been fundamentally reversed, a new teaching order combining classroom teaching, productive labor, artistic practice, and scientific research has been established, bourgeois educational thought and musical thought have been criticized, the political and ideological nature of teaching content has been strengthened, and a series of reforms have been carried out in teaching content, teaching system, teaching methods, and teaching organization. The vast number of teachers and students have participated in productive labor and gone deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, bringing about profound changes in teaching work and ideological outlook. At present, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a movement of advanced collectives and advanced workers has been launched, and all work has taken on a new look.

All these achievements have been made in the continuous struggle between two roads. Last spring, on the basis of summarizing the experience of the education revolution, a new teaching order was established; but a very small number of teachers and students put forward the arguments of "not attending to one's proper occupation, lowering quality" and "extensive planting and thin harvesting, slow work and meticulous craftsmanship" to oppose the education revolution.

What is "not attending to one's proper occupation"? First, the policy of walking on two legs has been implemented. On the premise of running the undergraduate program well, we have held cadre training classes, ethnic minority classes, and adult education departments. Second, artistic practice has been strengthened. We not only hold concerts in the concert hall, but also go to factories, rural areas, teahouses, temple fairs, and cinemas to hold various forms of concerts more than a thousand times. We have not only created large-scale works such as the opera "Song of Youth" and the "People's Commune Chorus" and dozens of other large-scale works, but also created more than two thousand small works of various kinds. Third, scientific research has been strengthened. Among them, the investigation of the music of fraternal ethnic groups alone has recorded 2,850 folk songs and musical pieces, and written 1.5 million words of investigation reports. With such tremendous achievements, how can it be said that we are "not attending to our proper occupation"?

As for "quality," facts are the best answer. The quality of our music education is much higher than before liberation. In terms of composition, the bourgeoisie ran music education for decades, and the graduates composed only works such as "Lullaby," while our third-year students wrote works like "Youth Piano Concerto." Our music middle school graduates have already won gold medals at the World Youth Festival. As compared with before the education revolution, the teaching level has also been greatly improved; many students' creations reflect more profoundly the spirit and breadth of mind of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward, which was impossible in the past. As for vocal and instrumental performance, taking the student orchestra as an example, it used to take more than 20 rehearsals to practice a dance piece, but now, for the ballet "The Mermaid," two hours or more of newly created music can be completed satisfactorily after only two weeks of rehearsal. Can it be said that this is not a clear example of the improvement of teaching quality? And what is especially important is that strengthening artistic practice has cultivated a healthy performance psychology in students. When performing, students no longer think about "personal success or failure" and technical problems such as "touch" and "resonance position." They understand that their performances serve the noble purpose of "serving proletarian politics." In the words of the students, "Going on stage is no longer heart-stopping, but full of emotion, open-minded, and easy to handle."

As for the argument that "extensive planting" can only lead to "thin harvesting" and that "slow work" is the only way to produce "fine craftsmanship," facts have already answered them. The Central Conservatory of Music has reduced its original teaching staff by a quarter, while the total number of students has increased by about one time. The Peasant Music Primary School founded in Yongfeng People's Commune near Beijing has only been running for one year, and nine of the eleven graduates have been admitted to music middle school with excellent grades. In fact, only extensive planting can lead to abundant harvesting, and the reform of teaching content has led to the transformation of teaching methods. Slow work may produce fine craftsmanship, but slow work does not necessarily produce fine craftsmanship. Under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward, breaking superstitions, daring to think and act, and under the principle of proceeding in an orderly manner, the teaching progress can also leap forward. This is a new "order." Taking the instrumental music, a profession with the strongest technology, as an example, in the past, only "solo" was learned in a semester, and a "concerto" could not be completed. Under the new situation, the training of students in "unison," "ensemble," and "chorus" has been strengthened, thereby greatly promoting the learning progress of "solo."

In the past two years, we have had the following experiences:

First, we must adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the leadership of the Party, establish lofty ambitions, and plant the red flag on business practice.

To implement putting politics in command in music education, we must establish the absolute leadership of the Party, strengthen the Party's leadership over all aspects of school work, including teaching and business work, and resolutely oppose the theory of division of labor between politics and business – the idea that the Party committee is in charge of ideology and experts are in charge of business. At the same time, on the basis of raising the political awareness of teachers and students and constantly carrying out self-transformation to gradually establish a proletarian world outlook, we must establish the lofty ambition of striving to build a socialist national musical culture; only in this way can we plant the red flag on business practice.

In the past two years, all teachers and students have gradually reached a consensus that our goal is to build a musical culture with socialist and communist ideology, with beautiful national forms, and with a combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism as the guiding principle for creation. However, there are also a few people who, while acknowledging this point, believe that the task of music education is only to cultivate musical talents with a relatively solid professional foundation by imparting ancient and foreign musical practice experience and knowledge, and should not directly participate in the creation and construction of the aforementioned new musical culture. In our view, this is precisely the fundamental difference between us and bourgeois music education. Bourgeois music education is at best a process of imparting knowledge, while proletarian music education should never be limited to the scope of imparting knowledge; music education should not only lay a professional foundation, but also enable students to have the ability to recognize and express life and serve proletarian politics with music as a weapon through ideological education and professional training. Therefore, we should not only impart ancient and foreign knowledge, but also summarize the experience of contemporary musical practice to enrich teaching content, and should directly participate in the actual work of national musical culture construction. Specifically, in music education, at the current revolutionary stage, it is to gradually establish a socialist national music education system in the process of deeply implementing the education revolution.

In order to achieve this goal, we must constantly criticize bourgeois ideology, further implement the Party's education policy, break superstitions, emancipate our minds, and constantly reform teaching content and teaching methods; specifically, it is to carry out the work of criticism, innovation, and creation in music education.

Therefore, we must strengthen the teaching of national music. Although the idea of ​​disregarding national traditions has been severely criticized, concrete measures must be taken to gradually eliminate the deeply ingrained nihilistic view of national musical culture. For basic courses such as sight-singing, piano, music theory, and harmony, which are commonly required for any major, necessary national musical materials and content should be adopted to make the basic training process of each student also a process of familiarizing themselves with national musical culture.

When formulating the "List of Essential Readings in National Music," it is stipulated that students in each grade must memorize and analyze the documents, and list them as assessment items. In addition, jointly required courses on national music (including national, storytelling, opera, and instrumental music overview) and courses on the music of fraternal ethnic groups should also be offered.

Inheritance must be criticized and selective. The so-called "valuing elegance and despising vulgarity" thought that is common in national music teaching is actually a manifestation of the lack of necessary class analysis of the national music tradition. On the other hand, inheritance itself is not the goal. Criticizing inheritance is to develop the tradition. It must be admitted that national music has its limitations in historical development. Some rich practices still lack scientific summary, and some fields have not been highly developed. Therefore, national music teaching has, on the one hand, a problem of "taking its democratic essence and removing its feudal dross," and on the other hand, a problem of "modernization" and "nationalization." Therefore, we must strengthen the collation and research of national music, encourage "Western medicine" to learn "traditional Chinese medicine," so that teachers with modern music knowledge can conduct comprehensive and systematic research on national music on the basis of learning national music; first starting with the analysis of musical forms and works and then extending to others. At the same time, we must expand the repertoire of national instrumental music teaching and compile systematic basic exercises; and try out a system in which students majoring in national musical instruments can take elective courses in similar Western musical instruments.

On the other side of criticizing and inheriting traditions is the issue of inheriting the excellent musical culture traditions of various countries in the world. We must seriously study the Western European bourgeois musical culture that has undergone high development since the eighteenth century, which is of great significance for creating our socialist musical culture. However, we cannot take an unconditional attitude of worship towards it without distinction simply because this musical culture has been highly developed; we should use the Marxist point of view to give a correct evaluation. The musical culture in class society must always be stamped with the brand of the class. The musical culture of Western Europe since the eighteenth century, which is called the classical tradition, also belongs to the bourgeois category; in terms of ideological content, necessary class analysis should be carried out. We should launch a mass academic criticism movement, criticize the methods and viewpoints of bourgeois musicologists in researching and evaluating the bourgeois musical culture since the eighteenth century, and put the Western European bourgeois musicians since the eighteenth century in their due historical positions, neither exaggerating their role and influence in history so as to blur the necessary ideological boundaries, nor shrinking it to lead to anti-historicism conclusions. At the same time, we must launch a criticism movement against the viewpoints, methods, and theories of important schools of musicology and music aesthetics in history, and eliminate the ideological poison of bourgeois idealism. The teaching repertoire related to Western European classical music should be gradually and one by one provided with necessary explanations and annotations, so that students can gain a correct understanding and understanding of these repertoires.

We are opposed to limiting music education to the scope of imparting knowledge, but we must admit that in the task of critical inheritance, music education must bear the task of imparting knowledge, so we must enable students to have extensive knowledge, even for the decadent and decadent modernist music of the modern bourgeoisie, we must first understand it if we want to criticize it, which requires us to have knowledge in this area. In music education, there is a problem of imparting knowledge of historical schools, styles, and genres. Students with this knowledge can truly have a broad vision and a high aesthetic appreciation ability.

In addition to the issue of knowledge, there is also a technical issue. Music is an art with strong technical skills, especially like music performance majors, which must have a solid technical foundation. Generally speaking, technology is a question of who masters it and who it serves. In this regard, the high development of Western European bourgeois musical culture has accumulated rich experience. We should not only not reject it, but also learn it thoroughly. As for the socialist musical culture of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, it is even more a model for us to learn from, which is naturally beyond doubt.

However, for music performance and vocal performance majors, when we perform and sing musical literature that is not our own national music, there is a question of establishing a national school. This is first of all a question of having national style and characteristics in performance and singing. In order to achieve this goal, we must first start with performing and singing Chinese repertoire. Under the premise of adapting to the requirements of teaching and artistic practice, we should try to use modern Chinese literature in the teaching materials; and compile basic exercises that adapt to national modes and musical vocabulary, and establish a course in the history of piano, violin, vocal music, opera... art that is self-contained.

As for the composition major, the fundamental problem is the issue of nationalization, which is a question of national habits, preferences, and styles based on the national common psychological quality. This requires: establishing a polyphonic writing system on the basis of national modes and folk musical vocabulary; studying the structural principles and techniques of national traditional musical culture and modern musical literature, and introducing them into teaching materials.

The implementation of the Party's General Line and education policy has made the vast number of teachers and students clear about the glorious mission of building our country's socialist national musical culture, and has begun new explorations and experiments in teaching practice. The lofty ambition of serving socialist construction and striving to build a socialist national musical culture has greatly promoted the reform of teaching and the improvement of teaching quality and academic level. Great political ideals produce great power. Planting the banner of politics on business practice produces infinite power.

Secondly, we must adhere to the principle of linking theory with practice, adhere to the mass line, and embody the new teaching order and teaching system of the "four combinations" in the teaching plan, teaching syllabus, and teaching materials of each course.

Linking theory with practice is the primary link in improving teaching quality. Strengthening artistic practice has fundamentally changed the abnormal situation in the past where "those who teach composition do not compose, and those who teach singing do not sing"; and only by going deep into life and deep into the struggle can composition and singing obtain the source of artistic creation, thus greatly improving the ideological and professional level of teachers. Through artistic practice, students not only consolidate the results of their learning, but also accelerate the progress of teaching. Countless concrete examples since the education revolution have illustrated this point.

However, artistic practice should be closely combined with classroom teaching, so that artistic practice is included in the teaching plan and becomes an indispensable part of teaching. Artistic practice has tested the results of teaching, and has also become the driving force for promoting the continuous reform of teaching and improving quality, consolidating teaching and enriching teaching. However, artistic practice must obey and serve teaching in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals without disrupting the system that teaching should have. It is wrong to oppose artistic practice under the pretext of the systematic nature of teaching; but it is also not conducive to the improvement of teaching quality to disregard the necessary systematic nature of teaching due to artistic practice, and therefore it is also wrong.

Adhering to the mass line in teaching, combining teachers and students, and learning from each other are another link in improving teaching quality. Establishing teaching collectives and appropriately combining the individual teaching and collective teaching that are necessary for music teaching is not only because the level of music teachers in our country cannot yet meet the objective requirements, but more importantly, it is to concentrate the wisdom of the masses to make up for the shortcomings of individual instruction in music teaching. Because music needs to use individual instruction methods, the method of establishing teaching collectives and implementing teacher-student integration must be adopted to widely concentrate the wisdom of the masses and achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Central Conservatory of Music has applied this new teaching method and achieved the effect of rapidly improving teaching quality.

However, it must be pointed out that the principle of the minority obeying the majority cannot be simply applied to artistic and academic issues; in implementing the mass line and implementing collective teaching, the principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" must be firmly implemented, allowing free debate of different opinions and allowing different teaching propositions to have the opportunity and conditions for experimentation.

The new teaching order of the four combinations of classroom teaching, productive labor, artistic practice, and scientific research can be said to have been embodied in the new teaching plan. However, the reform of teaching content must be specifically embodied in the new teaching syllabus, and gradually compile our own teaching materials for various courses, and at the same time use the new teaching system, teaching methods, and teaching organization to ensure the victorious establishment of this new "four combination" teaching system.

Thirdly, we must continue to carry out the struggle between two roads, constantly carry out teaching reform and academic criticism, so as to continuously improve teaching quality.

In the two years of the education revolution, music education has experienced a profound ideological revolution, and bourgeois political thought and musical thought have been criticized. However, bourgeois thought, especially musical thought, still has harmful influences remaining in music schools, which are piled up with bourgeois intellectuals. Therefore, the struggle between two roads must be continued in order to carry out the education revolution in depth and further implement the Party's education policy and literary and art policy.

Bourgeois musical thought – aesthetic viewpoints, creative methods, etc. – is the last and most solid fortress of bourgeois intellectuals' bourgeois thought. Only by carrying out academic criticism can they abandon the bourgeois musical thought that remains deep in their minds and finally accept the effective methods of Marxism-Leninism from the artistic point of view.

For example, some remaining harmful arguments in the field of musical thought have not been thoroughly criticized. For example, in music aesthetics, the so-called "polysemy" and "uncertainty" of music are unilaterally emphasized. One of the arguments is that the same music can be interpreted differently by different performers and conductors; the second argument is that the content of instrumental music is "invisible, intangible, and untouchable," and therefore difficult to grasp. In fact, of course this is not "polysemy"; because, first, although it is the same music, after different artistic treatments, different treatments are made in speed, intensity, syntax, and especially expression, this can only be said to be different interpretations and re-creations of the same music. Second, the aesthetic process of any piece of music is always a process influenced and determined by historical conditions and class, and the aesthetic process and the creative process should not be confused (how to correctly explain "polysemy" and "uncertainty" in music aesthetics should also be further studied). As for music, due to the reasons of expressive materials (sound) and the appreciation process (hearing), thereby producing the characteristics of expressing ideological content, this cannot be said to be "uncertainty." However, this kind of specious argument still has a considerable influence in music schools. If starting from such an argument, it will inevitably reach the conclusion of canceling the content and purpose of music, and fall into the quagmire of "unknowable." Another example is the "technicalism" in creation and criticism methods, which makes them regard music creation as the purely technical processing of musical theme materials, thereby adopting a cold "academic" creative method; in the eyes of these people, music creation is only the height of the technique of music writing – polyphonic writing methods, tonal layout, orchestral color... and other techniques. As for music criticism, they also purely focus on technology; music criticism becomes a cumbersome, trivial technical analysis, while the ideological content of the work can be completely ignored. Of course, we absolutely do not deny the importance of skills in music creation, nor do we advocate that music criticism should be separated from the analysis of professional skills and techniques in music creation. The problem is that these should not be all of the creative and critical methods.

Only by continuing to carry out the academic criticism movement can teaching quality truly continuously improve in the direction of proletarian music education. Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead bravely!

    在音乐教育工作中贯彻教育革命的一点体会
    赵沨
    两年来，在党的总路线和毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在全国大跃进形势的推动下，中央音乐学院和全国其他音乐院校一样，经历了革命性的根本变化。在整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，进行了教育革命，贯彻执行了“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针，确立了党对学校工作的领导，基本扭转了过去脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离传统、脱离实际的情况，建立了课堂教学、生产劳动、艺术实践、科学研究四结合的新的教学秩序，批判了资产阶级教育思想和音乐思想，加强了教学内容的政治性和思想性，对教学内容、教学制度、教学方法和教学组织进行了一系列的改革。广大师生参加了生产劳动，深入工农兵群众，使教学工作和思想面貌起了深刻的变化。目前，根据党的八届八中全会的精神，开展了先进集体和先进工作者运动，各项工作有了更新的气象。
    所有这些成绩，都是在不断地进行两条道路的斗争中取得的。去年春季，在总结教育革命经验的基础上，确立了新的教学秩序；但师生中有极少数的人便提出“不务正业、降低质量”和“广种薄收、慢工细活”的论点来反对教育革命。
    什么是“不务正业”呢？一是实行了两条腿走路的方针，我们在办好本科的前提下，举办了干部进修班、少数民族班和业余部。二是加强了艺术实践，我们不仅在音乐厅举行音乐会，也还下工厂、农村、茶馆、庙会、电影院去举行各种形式的音乐会一千多场。我们不仅创作了歌剧“青春之歌”和“人民公社大合唱”等几十种大型作品，还创作了各种小型作品二千多首。三是加强了科学研究，其中仅兄弟民族音乐调查一项，即记录民歌和乐曲二千八百五十首，写出调查报告一百五十万字。有了这样巨大的成绩，怎么能说是“不务正业”呢。
    说到“质量”，事实是最好的回答。我们的音乐教育质量比起解放前，不知要高了多少。以创作论，资产阶级办了几十年音乐教育，毕业生创作的只是什么“摇篮曲”之类的作品，而我们三年级的学生便写了像“青年钢琴协奏曲”之类的作品。我们的音乐中学毕业生已经获得了世界青年联欢节的金质奖章。至于和教育革命以前比较，教学水平也是大大地提高了；许多学生的创作比较深刻地反映了大跃进的中国人民的气概和胸怀，这是过去做不到的。再说演唱和演奏专业，仅以学生管弦乐队为例，过去练习一个舞曲便需要二十次以上的练习，现在为舞剧“鱼美人”伴奏，两个小时以上的新创作的音乐，仅仅两个星期的练习便已经胜任愉快地完成了任务，这能说不是教学质量提高的明显例证么？而尤其重要的是，加强艺术实践已经使学生培养成一种健康的表演心理状态，学生们在表演时心里想的再不是
  “个人成败”和什么“触键”、“共鸣位置”等技术问题了，他们了解到他们的演出是服务于“为无产阶级政治服务”的崇高目的，用学生们的话来说：“上台再不心惊肉跳而是情感充沛，心胸开扩，得心应手了”。
    至于“广种”只能“薄收”，“慢工”才出“细活”的论点，事实已经对它们作出了回答。中央音乐学院在减少原有教师四分之一的情况下，在校学生总数增长约一倍。在北京近郊永丰人民公社创办的农民音乐小学才开办一年，十一个毕业生中有九个以优异的成绩考进了音乐中学。事实上只有广种才能丰收，而教学内容改革已经引起了教学方法的变革，慢工可能出细活，但不是慢工一定出细活。在大跃进形势的推动下，破除迷信，敢想敢做，在循序渐进的原则下，教学进度也可以跃进，这正是一种新的“序”。以管弦乐器这种技术最强的专业来看，过去一学期中只学“独奏”，还不能学完一个“协奏曲”，而在新的情况下，实行了加强对学生的“齐奏”、“重奏”、“合奏”的训练，从而大大推动了“独奏”的学习进度。
    两年来的工作，我们有如下的一些体会：
    首先是坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，树立雄心壮志，把红旗插到业务实践上。
    在音乐教育工作中实行政治挂帅，必须树立党的绝对领导，加强党对学校各项工作包括教学、业务工作的领导，坚决反对政治、业务分工论——党委管思想、专家管业务的思想。同时要在提高师生政治觉悟、不断进行自我改造以逐步树立无产阶级世界观的基础上，树立为建设社会主义的民族的音乐文化而奋斗的雄心壮志；这样，才能把红旗插到业务实践上。
    两年来，全体师生逐步一致地认识到，我们的目标是建设具有社会主义和共产主义思想的、具有优美的民族形式的、以革命的浪漫主义和革命的现实主义相结合为创作指导原则的音乐文化。但是，也有少数人虽然承认这一点，但却认为音乐教育的任务，只是通过传授古代和外国的音乐实践经验和知识，来培养具有比较坚实的业务基础的音乐人才，而不应直接参与上述这种新音乐文化的创造和建设。我们看来，这正是我们和资产阶级音乐教育的根本分歧所在。资产阶级音乐教育充其量只是一个传授知识的过程，而无产阶级的音乐教育绝不应该只局限在传授知识的范围之内；音乐教育不仅只是打下业务基础，而且应该通过思想教育和业务训练，使学生具有以音乐为武器来认识和表现生活、为无产阶级政治服务的能力。所以我们不仅应该传授古代和外国的知识，也应该总结当代音乐实践的经验来丰富教学内容，并且应该直接参与国家音乐文化建设的实际工作。具体体现到音乐教育工作中，在目前这一革命阶段，就是在深入实行教育革命的过程中，逐步建立起一个社会主义的、民族的音乐教育体系。
    为了实现这一目的，必须在不断批判资产阶级思想，进一步贯彻党的教育工作方针，破除迷信，解放思想，对教学内容和教学方法进行不断的改革；具体地说，就是在音乐教育中进行批判、革新、创造的工作。
    因此，必须加强民族音乐的教学工作。轻视民族传统的思想虽然已经遭到严正的批判，但必须采取具体措施，才能逐步肃清那种根深蒂固的对待民族音乐文化所持取的虚无主义观点。对于任何专业所共同必修的视唱、钢琴、乐理、和声等基础课程，要采用必要的民族音乐的素材和内容，使每个学生的基本训练的过程，也是一个熟悉民族音乐文化的过程。
    在制订“民族音乐必读文献目录”时，规定每一年级学生必须背诵、分析的文献，并列作考核项目。此外，还要开设共同必修的民族音乐课程（包括民族、说唱、戏曲和器乐音乐概论）和兄弟民族音乐概论课程。
    继承必须有所批判和取舍，民族音乐教学中普遍存在的所谓“重雅轻俗”的思想，实际上便是对民族音乐传统缺乏必要的阶级分析的表现。另一方面，继承的本身并不是目的，批判地继承传统是为了发展传统，必须承认，民族音乐有其历史发展的局限的一面，有些丰富的实践还缺乏科学的总结，有些领域也没有得到高度的发展，因而，民族音乐教学，一方面有个“取其民主性的精华，去其封建性的糟粕”的问题，另一方面有个“现代化”和“民族化”的问题。所以，我们要加强民族音乐的整理、研究工作，鼓励“西医”学“中医”，使具有现代音乐的教师在学习民族音乐的基础上，对民族音乐进行全面、系统的研究；首先是从曲体及作品分析入手再推及其他。同时要扩大民族器乐教学的曲目和编写系统的基本练习；并试行主修民族乐器的学生选修相近的西洋乐器的制度。
    在批判、继承传统的另一面是继承世界各国优秀音乐文化传统的问题。对于十八世纪以来经历过高度发展的西欧资产阶级音乐文化，我们必须认真学习，这对于创造我国的社会主义音乐文化有着重要的借鉴的意义。但是，我们不能因为这种音乐文化曾经得到高度发展，因而便不加区别地对之采取一种无条件的崇拜态度；应该用马克思主义的观点予以正确的评价。阶级社会中的音乐文化总要被打上阶级的烙印，西欧十八世纪以来的被称为古典传统的音乐文化，也是属于资产阶级范畴的；从思想内容上来说，便应该进行必要的阶级分析。我们应展开一个群众性的学术批判运动，对资产阶级音乐学家在研究、评价十八世纪以来资产阶级音乐文化的方法和观点进行批判，把十八世纪以来西欧资产阶级音乐家置于历史上应有的地位，对其在历史上的作用和影响，既不夸大从而模糊必要的思想界限，也不缩小以致导向反历史主义的结论。同时要展开一个对历史上的有关音乐学、音乐美学重要流派的观点、方法和理论的批判运动，清除资产阶级唯心主义的思想毒害。对有关西欧古典音乐的教学曲目，逐步、逐一作出必要的说明和注释，以期学生对这些曲目都能获得正确的理解和认识。
    我们反对把音乐教育局限在传授知识的范围，但是我们必须承认在批判地继承这个任务中，音乐教育必须担负传授知识的任务，因而我们必须使学生具有广博的知识，即使对于现代资产阶级的颓废腐朽的现代主义音乐，我们要批判它也首先必须了解它，这就需要我们具备这方面的知识。在音乐教育中，有个对于历史上的流派、风格、体裁的知识的传授问题，学生具备这些知识，才能真正具有开阔的视野和高度的美学鉴赏能力。
    除了知识问题之外，还有一个技术问题，音乐是一种技艺性很强的艺术，特别是像音乐演奏专业，更必须具备坚实的技术基础。一般说技术是个为谁掌握和为谁服务的问题。而在这方面，西欧资产阶级音乐文化的高度发展，积累了丰富的经验，我们不仅不应排斥，而且应该学深学透。至于苏联及其他兄弟国家的社会主义的音乐文化，则更是我们学习的榜样，这自然是毫无疑问的了。
    但是对于音乐演奏和演唱专业，我们演奏和演唱非本民族的音乐文献时，则有一个建立民族学派的问题。这首先是在演奏和演唱上应该具有民族风格和特征的问题。为达到这一目的，首先必须从演奏和演唱中国曲目着手。要在适应教学和艺术实践的要求的前提下，在教材曲目中尽量引用现代的中国文献；并编写适应民族调式和乐汇的基本练习和建立自成体系的钢琴、提琴、声乐、歌剧……艺术史的课程。
    至于创作专业，则根本的问题是个民族化的问题，也就是一个根据民族共同心理素质的民族习惯、爱好和风格的问题。这就必须：在民族调式和民乐乐汇的基础上建立多声部写作体系；研究民族传统音乐文化以及现代音乐文献的结构原则和手法特征，并引入教材。
    党的总路线和教育方针的贯彻，使广大师生明确了建设我国社会主义的、民族的音乐文化的光荣使命，并开始在教学实践中开始新的探索和试验。为社会主义建设服务、为建设社会主义的、民族的音乐文化而努力的雄心壮志，大大推动了教学的改革以及教学质量和学术水平的提高。伟大的政治理想产生伟大的力量，把政治这面帅旗插到业务实践上，就产生了无穷的力量。
    其次是坚持理论联系实际，坚持群众路线，把“四结合”的新的教学秩序和教学体系，体现到教学计划、教学大纲和每一门课程的教材上。
    理论联系实际是提高教学质量的首要环节，加强艺术实践首先从根本上改变了过去“教作曲的不作曲，教演唱的不演唱”的不正常的情况；而作曲和演唱，只有深入生活，深入斗争才能获得艺术创造的源泉，这样，就大大提高了教师的思想水平和业务水平。学生通过艺术实践，不但巩固了学习的成果同时也加速了教学的进度。教育革命以来，无数的具体事例说明了这一点。
    但是艺术实践应该与课堂教学密切结合，使艺术实践列入教学计划，成为教学的一个不可缺少的组成部分。艺术实践检验了教学的成果，也就成为推动教学不断改革和提高质量的动力，巩固了教学也丰富了教学。但艺术实践必须服从和服务于教学，才能达到上述的目的而又不致因而打乱了教学上应有的系统性。借口教学的系统性而反对艺术实践是错误的；但因艺术实践而不顾及教学上必要的系统性也不利于教学质量的提高，因而也是不对的。
    坚持教学中的群众路线，师生结合，教学相长，是提高教学质量的又一环节。建立教学集体，使音乐教学上必须的个别教学和集体教学适当地结合起来，这不仅因为目前我国音乐师资水平还不能与客观要求相适应，更主要的是集中群众的智慧来弥补音乐教学上的个别传授的不足。因为音乐需要运用个别传授的方法，所以必须采用建立教学集体和实行师生结合的方法，才能广泛地集中群众的智慧，收到事半功倍之效。中央音乐学院应用了这一新的教学方法，收到了教学质量迅速提高的效果。
    但必须指出，在艺术和学术问题上不能简单地运用少数服从多数的原则；在贯彻群众路线、实行集体教学中必须坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的原则，允许不同意见的自由争辩和不同的教学主张都能得到试验的机会和条件。
    课堂教学、生产劳动、艺术实践和科学研究四结合的新的教学秩序可以说已经体现在新的教学计划上了。但教学内容的改革必须具体体现在新的教学大纲中，并逐步地编写出我国自己的各种课程教材，同时用新的教学制度、教学方法和教学组织保证这种新的“四结合”的教学体系的胜利建立。
    再其次是继续开展两条道路的斗争，不断进行教学改革和学术批判，以不断提高教学质量。
    教育革命的两年，音乐教育经历了深刻的思想革命，资产阶级的政治思想和音乐思想受到了批判。但资产阶级思想特别是音乐思想，在音乐学校这种资产阶级知识分子成堆的地方，仍然残存着有害的影响，因而必须继续开展两条道路的斗争，才能深入进行教育革命，进一步贯彻党的教育方针和文艺工作方针。
    资产阶级音乐思想——美学观点、创作方法等，是资产阶级知识分子的资产阶级思想的最后的也是最坚固的堡垒，只有开展学术批判，才能使他们放弃残存于思想深处的资产阶级音乐思想，最后从艺术观点上接受马克思列宁主义的有效方法。
    举例来说，在音乐思想领域中还有一些残存的有害的论点并没有受到彻底的批判。如在音乐美学上片面强调音乐的所谓“多义性”和“不确定性”，论据之一是同一音乐在不同的演奏家和指挥家可以作不同的解释；论据之二是器乐音乐的内容是“看不见、摸不着、抓不住”的，因而是难于捉摸的。事实上这当然不是什么“多义性”；因为，第一，虽然是同一音乐，但是经过不同的艺术处理，在速度、力度、句法、特别是表情上做了不同的处理之后，这只能说是对同一音乐的不同的解释和再创造，第二，对任何一件音乐作品的审美过程，总是一个受历史条件以及阶级影响和决定的过程，不应该把审美过程和创作过程混同起来（对于音乐美学上如何正确的解释“多义性”和“不确定性”还应该展开深入的研究）。至于音乐由于表现素材（声音）和欣赏过程（听觉）的原因，从而产生去表现思想内容上的特点，这更不能说是什么“不确定性”。但这种似是而非的论点在音乐学校还有相当广泛的影响，如果从这样的论点出发，势必达到取消音乐的内容性和目的性的结论，陷入“不可知”的泥坑。又如在创作、批评方法上的“唯技术论”，使他们把音乐创作看成是对音乐主题素材的纯技术性的处理，从而采用冷冰冰的“学院式”的创作方法；在这些人看来，音乐创作只是音乐写作的技巧——多声部写作方法、调性布局、管弦色彩……等技术的高低而已。至于音乐批评，他们也是纯粹只从技术上着眼；音乐批评变成了繁琐、枝节的技术分析，而作品思想内容则可以完全不去涉及。当然，我们绝对不是否认音乐创作上技巧的重要性，也不是主张音乐批评脱离音乐创作上专业技巧手法的分析，问题只是这些不应是创作、批评方法的全部而已。
    只有继续开展学术批判运动，教学质量才能真正向无产阶级的音乐教育的方向不断提高。让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，奋勇前进！
