Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 24th: A rally in support of the Dominican people's anti-dictatorial struggle was held in Havana last night. This was the fourth day of activities for the Week of Solidarity with the Latin American People.

    The rally condemned the Trujillo dictatorship as a bloody regime imposed on the Dominican Republic by U.S. imperialism to maintain the colonial rule of monopoly groups.

    Workers, students, and people from all walks of life attending the rally observed a minute of silence for the Dominican revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle, and enthusiastically supported the call for all anti-dictatorial forces to unite.

    Dominican exile Avilado Biciosso said that the Cuban Revolution showed the people of Latin American countries the possibility of opposing the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and striving for independence. Trujillo became notorious for serving the American occupiers. When the Americans withdrew from the Dominican Republic, they left behind puppet troops trained by the United States and reactionary leaders such as Trujillo. In 1930, Trujillo came to power through a military coup supported by the U.S. government and implemented a bloody police reign of terror.

    He added that the Trujillo regime is the gendarme of imperialism against the peoples and democratic governments of Latin American countries, especially against the Cuban Revolution, and a haven for counter-revolutionary conspirators. Biciosso finally demanded the release of the thousands of political prisoners held in Trujillo's prisons and called for intensified defense of the Cuban Revolution, which is the vanguard of the Latin American revolution.

    Honorio Villasis, a member of the Executive Committee of the Ecuadorian Workers' Confederation, expressed the support of the people of South American countries for the anti-dictatorial struggle of Dominican patriots. He pointed out that, thanks to the Cuban revolution, the moment has arrived in Latin America to stop U.S. imperialism. He emphasized that the people of Latin American countries are determined to defend the Cuban Revolution to the death.

    Venezuelan Congressman Fabricio Ojeda condemned the exploitation of Latin America by U.S. imperialism and expressed his conviction that the Dominican people, with the support of their fraternal brothers in Latin America, will surely achieve victory. He emphasized that the unity of the people of Latin American countries in the struggle against U.S. imperialist rule and puppet dictatorships is the guarantee of victory.

    The conference also read out congratulatory messages from some trade unions. The Paint Pigment Factory Workers' Union proposed the establishment of a standing committee to support Latin America in order to support the struggle against dictatorial rule and its mainstay, imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to TASS, Montevideo, March 19th: The Latin American Socialist Party International Advisory Committee meeting, which was recently held in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, adopted a resolution condemning the arms race policy. This resolution was published in the Uruguayan Socialist Party's organ, "The Sun."

    The meeting also passed a special resolution expressing solidarity with the Cuban Revolution. The resolution stated, "Any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Cuba is an aggression against the whole of Latin America."

    Latin American socialists also supported Castro's proposal to convene a conference of underdeveloped countries in Havana.

    哈瓦那集会支持多米尼加人民的斗争
    各国代表谴责美帝国主义支持特鲁希略独裁政权
    据新华社哈瓦那24日电　昨天晚上哈瓦那举行了支持多米尼加人民反独裁斗争的大会。这是支援拉丁美洲人民周第四天的活动。
    大会谴责特鲁希略独裁政权是美帝国主义为维持垄断集团的殖民统治而强加给多米尼加的血腥政权。
    参加大会的工人、学生和各界人士为在斗争中牺牲的多米尼加革命烈士默哀一分钟，并且热烈支持要求一切反独裁力量团结起来的号召。
    多米尼加流亡者阿维拉多·比西奥索说，古巴革命向拉丁美洲各国人民显示了反对共同敌人美帝国主义和争取独立的可能性。特鲁希略由于为美国占领者效劳而臭名远扬。美国人在从多米尼加撤退时，留下了受过美国训练的傀儡军队和特鲁希略等反动头目。1930年特鲁希略通过在美国政府支持下的一次军事政变上台执政，实行了血腥的警察恐怖统治。
    他又说，特鲁希略政权是帝国主义反对拉丁美洲各国人民和民主政府，特别是反对古巴革命的宪兵，是反革命阴谋分子的避难所。比西奥索最后要求释放被囚在特鲁希略的监狱里的数以千计的政治犯，号召加紧保卫作为拉丁美洲革命先锋的古巴革命。
    厄瓜多尔工人联合会执行委员会委员奥诺里奥·比利亚西斯表示南美各国人民支持多米尼加爱国者的反独裁斗争。他指出，由于古巴的革命，在拉丁美洲制止美帝国主义的时刻已经来到了。他强调指出，拉丁美洲各国人民决心誓死保卫古巴革命。
    委内瑞拉众议员法夫里西奥·奥赫达谴责美帝国主义对拉丁美洲的压榨，并且表示确信多米尼加人民在拉丁美洲各兄弟人民的支持下必将取得胜利。他强调说，拉丁美洲各国人民在反对美帝国主义统治和傀儡独裁政权的斗争中的团结是胜利的保证。
    大会还宣读了一些工会的贺电。制画颜料厂工人工会提出建立支援拉丁美洲常设委员会来支持反对独裁统治及其支柱帝国主义的斗争。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚19日讯：不久前在玻利维亚首都拉巴斯举行的拉丁美洲社会党国际谘询委员会会议曾通过决议，谴责军备竞赛政策。这项决议刊载在乌拉圭社会党机关报“太阳报”上。
    会议还通过特别决议，声援古巴革命。决议中说，“干涉古巴内政的任何企图都是对整个拉丁美洲的侵略。”
    拉丁美洲社会党人还支持卡斯特罗关于在哈瓦那召开不发达国家会议的倡议。
