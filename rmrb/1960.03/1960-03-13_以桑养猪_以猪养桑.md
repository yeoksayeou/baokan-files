Raising Pigs with Mulberry, Enriching Mulberry with Pigs

The Twenty-third Production Brigade of Zhouzhuang People's Commune in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, has 103 mu of mulberry fields. In 1958, they used silkworm by-products to raise 108 pigs, achieving one pig per mu of mulberry field. This brigade, by raising pigs in mulberry orchards, not only developed pig farming but also obtained fertilizer for the mulberry fields, greatly promoting the development of both animal husbandry and sericulture. In 1959, the brigade distributed 224 silkworm egg sheets, producing 7,988.5 jin of cocoons, with an average yield of 73.6 jin per mu. Among them, 84 egg sheets produced 5,371.75 jin of cocoons, an increase of 82.1% compared to the same period in 1958. In 1959, the yield of mulberry leaves per mu was 1,700 jin, an increase of 83.3% compared to 927 jin in 1958. It is expected that an even better and greater leap forward will occur this year. Their methods of utilizing silkworm by-products to solve the problem of pig feed are: (1) Fully utilize residual mulberry leaves and silkworm droppings from silkworm rearing: Before and after the third sleep of the silkworms, the residual mulberry leaves and silkworm droppings are screened, dried, and stacked separately. Each egg sheet can yield approximately 150 to 200 jin of dry feed. (2) Collect withered yellow mulberry leaves: After the late autumn silkworms are mounted on the cocoon frames, all the withered yellow old leaves from the lower part of the mulberry branches are collected. Every 100 jin of withered yellow leaves can be dried into about 60 jin of dry feed. (3) Intercrop green manure in the mulberry fields and use the edges of the fields to sow carrots.

    以桑养猪　以猪养桑
    江苏江阴县周庄人民公社二十三生产大队，有桑田一百零三亩，1958年利用蚕桑副产品养猪一百零八头，实现了一亩桑田一头猪。这个队由于利用桑园养猪，不仅发展了生猪，而且取得了桑田用肥，大大促进了畜牧和蚕桑两项生产的发展。1959年该队实发蚕种二百二十四张，产茧七千九百八十八点五斤，平均亩产茧七十三点六斤，其中八十四张，产茧五千三百七十一点七五斤，比1958年同期增产82．1％；1959年亩产桑叶一千七百斤，较1958年九百二十七斤增产83．3％。预计今年将出现更好更大的跃进局面。他们利用蚕桑副产品解决养猪饲料的办法是：（1）充分利用养蚕残桑、蚕粪：三眠前后，将养蚕残桑、蚕粪筛净晒干分别堆放，每张种约可得干料一百五十至二百斤。（2）收集枯黄桑叶：晚秋蚕上簇后，将桑条下部枯黄老叶全部收集起来，每百斤枯黄叶可晒干料六十斤左右。（3）桑田间作绿肥和利用田边地埂播种胡萝卜。
