Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 10th: The Shangxinjie Party General Branch Committee in the Nan'an District of Chongqing, with the district store as the center, has concentrated and unified the use of the strength of financial and trade departments and extensively relied on the residents of the street to comprehensively organize and arrange people's economic life.

The fifteen residential sections in this area have established more than twenty public canteens, with over 90% of residents eating in the canteens; nurseries and thirty-nine nursery stations, groups, and teams have been established, forming a nursery network with three thousand children enrolled, accounting for 80% of the total number of pre-school children; three central service stations have been established, with fifteen life service stations and one hundred and twenty-eight family mutual aid groups, with over one thousand service personnel, forming a mass self-service network. The service items include: selling goods on consignment, handling transportation, selling stamps and newspapers, handling savings, collecting waste products, repairing furniture, painting houses, installing electric lights and water pipes, taking care of the elderly, sick, pregnant women, and children, doing cleaning work, etc. Shops rely on resident service stations to distribute certain commodities, making supply work more detailed and reasonable. Last year, over 380,000 yuan worth of goods were distributed through resident service stations, accounting for one-third of the total sales of the shops. All goods distributed through resident service stations are delivered to the residential sections or delivered to the door. The commercial departments have also adjusted and expanded the business of state-owned commercial, catering, and service repair industries, increasing the variety of goods and service items. The shops have added "omnipotent service departments," "pedestrian rest stations," and "boiled water stoves." Twenty state-owned restaurants and food stores have generally improved their supply work, steaming buns, stir-frying dishes, and cooking noodles for customers. Snack bars have restored and increased a number of foods and dishes with special flavors. Sewing, washing and dyeing, repair, and barber shops have also expanded their service items. All these have greatly facilitated the masses.

After this area comprehensively organized and arranged people's economic life, residents who participated in production lightened the burden of housework and were more at ease in production. For example, in the nine street factories run mainly by street women, the attendance rate of workers was over 93%. Last year, they produced more than 100 kinds of products for the market, with a total output value more than three times higher than in 1958. Residents increased their income and improved their lives because they participated in production or street service undertakings. Last year, the residents of this area received a total of 450,000 yuan in income from various production activities organized by the streets.

After the residents were organized in production and life, the collectivist spirit of mutual assistance and mutual service began to take shape. Zhang Sulan, a woman who suffered from paralysis, could not work and had no relatives to take care of her. Liu Xiuying, a service worker in the sixth residential section, often brought her food and water. Zhang Sulan was very grateful and asked someone to write down her inner feelings: "The general line shines brightly, Chairman Mao's kindness is long, mutual aid group member Liu Mama, brings food and water to my home; without sons or daughters, without reliance, neighbors are as close as family."

Commercial departments have become closer to the masses through organizing people's economic life. During festivals and holidays, many activists use their spare time to voluntarily pack goods, transport goods, and sell goods in shops. In this way, although the tasks of the commercial departments continue to increase, the supply and service work is done more deeply and meticulously, and the management work is further improved. At present, commercial workers in this area account for only 1.1% of the total population. The labor productivity of the shops last year increased by 77.66% compared with 1958, and the annual sales, purchase, expense, and capital turnover plans were completed forty days ahead of schedule.

The Shangxinjie area has more than 7,000 households and more than 32,000 residents. Since the Great Leap Forward, nine street factories and a street transportation team have been established here. More than 7,100 residents (85% of whom are women) have participated in production and labor in state-owned enterprises, street factories, and street transportation teams. In this way, much of the labor that was originally domestic now needs to be replaced by organized social labor. In response to this new situation, the Shangxinjie Party General Branch Committee has strengthened its leadership over the work of organizing people's economic life. With the district store as the center, it has unified the work of various financial and trade units (the business of each unit is still under the leadership of the superior business department), unified arrangements, and unified actions, changing the past situation in which each financial and trade unit had its own methods and engaged in its own business, and better exerted their strength. The street party organization promptly understands the political and ideological situation of the staff and workers of each unit, strengthens their education, inspects and supervises their work, and ensures that the work of organizing people's economic life and other financial and trade work continues to improve.

Under the unified leadership of the street party organization, from the street administrative leadership department to the various residential sections, and from the district store to the various financial and trade units, organizational structures for managing people's economic life have been established at all levels or special personnel have been assigned to be responsible, uniting the forces of all aspects. The street administrative leadership department has established a District People's Economic Life Committee, with the Shangxinjie district store as the main body, and has absorbed the participation of street people's representatives and heads of women's federations, vegetable stores, coal stores, food stores, grain stations, banks, major factories, institutions, schools, and public canteens. The heads of the street administrative leadership department and the district store serve as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, respectively. The specific work of the committee is to: investigate and study the needs of the masses, reasonably set up commercial and service outlets, determine the scope and principles of commodity distribution, study the development of collective welfare undertakings and exchange experiences in this regard, and lead the masses to develop non-staple food production. The committee also established an office, with cadres from the street administrative leadership department and the district store working there. The Shangxinjie district store internally established a People's Economic Life Headquarters, equipped with cadres to understand the needs of the masses, closely cooperate with the District People's Economic Life Committee to carry out work, and be responsible for guiding the service undertakings and welfare undertakings run by the streets.

Street service undertakings and welfare undertakings are carried out by mobilizing the masses and launching mass movements. The masses received leadership and assistance from the street administrative leadership department, the District People's Economic Life Committee, and mass organizations such as the street women's federation in establishing street public canteens, nursery networks, and life service networks. The family service workers who are fixed in the service stations are voluntarily registered by the residents and uniformly arranged and determined by the People's Economic Life Committee. Most of them are elderly women who do not directly participate in production and labor. Employees and residents also received close cooperation from district stores and other stores, banks, grain stations, and other units in running these undertakings, and vigorously supported them in terms of materials and technology. For example, after the District People's Economic Life Committee helped residents set up more than 20 public canteens, the district store opened a training class for cooks to train the cooks of the resident public canteens, and also sent chefs to the public canteens to teach cooking techniques; the grain station helped the canteens arrange grain consumption; the coal store guided the canteens to improve stoves and save coal; and the vegetable and food store staff often helped the canteens arrange recipes and tried various methods to supply the non-staple foods needed by the canteens. In this way, the masses can save grain, save money, eat their fill, and eat well in the canteens, and the number of diners continues to increase. The store actively supports and helps the nurseries in terms of materials, equipment, and commodity supply, and supports the life service stations through business and technical guidance and consignment sales of commodities, so that these organizations can be consolidated.

In the process of organizing people's economic life, the district store in Shangxinjie has also actively improved its own business. First, it has further improved the work of rationally allocating certain commodities. The shop assistants in the district store who are in charge of people's economic life are divided into areas and contracted to go deep into each residential section, relying on mass organizations such as residents' committees and residents' life service stations to understand the situation door-to-door and grasp the consumption level and living habits of various types of people. Generally, shop assistants can achieve three knowledges (knowing the number of households, the number of people, and the location of the distribution), four familiarities (familiar with the supply area, the supply object, living habits, and consumption level), and two timeliness (timely understanding of needs and timely distribution). Before the distribution, resident forums are held through the resident service stations to publicize the distribution principles. In the distribution, special consideration is given to the needs of the elderly, young, sick, pregnant women, etc. Second, the supply and service institutions are expanded, and the variety of commodities and service items are increased to further facilitate the masses. (For detailed information on the comprehensive organization of people's economic life in Shangxinjie, see page 7 today.)

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 10th: Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, Chongqing City is relying on the broad masses to organize people's economic life, which has been fully launched from point to surface. Due to the in-depth development of this work, new atmospheres have emerged in the city's production, street work, and people's spiritual outlook.

The work of organizing people's economic life in Chongqing City was first carried out in Shangxinjie in 1958. Since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of laborers in various streets have participated in the production of state-owned factories; semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers have also been organized to carry out non-staple food production, small commodity production, and develop repair and fitting businesses. After the broad masses of residents, especially housewives, took up production jobs, the housework that was originally solved by each family has now become a social problem, and the masses urgently demand that the Party and the government lead them to organize and manage their lives well. In response to this new situation, under the unified leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, the financial and trade departments and street administrative leadership departments took the lead, and coordinated with the civil affairs departments, women's federations, and other units to start together, focusing on helping the masses run collective canteens well and vigorously developing life and welfare undertakings. The quality of the canteens is the most important thing related to the lives of the masses. The financial and trade departments not only provide great help in terms of political ideology, equipment, cooking technology, sources of goods, and the establishment of management systems, but also help collective canteens set up small food departments and small shops, boiled water stoves, simple bathrooms, tea gardens, etc. Now, the general canteens are run relatively well, and the quality of service is constantly improving, which is welcomed by the masses. More than 27,000 collective canteens have been established in the city, and the number of people eating in them accounts for 80% of the total number of people in general areas, and more than 90% in more areas.

In helping the masses to develop life and welfare undertakings, all regions of the city have adopted the method of "the masses do their own things, and everyone manages their own affairs" to organize and develop mass self-service and life mutual assistance. The enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Those who have people contribute people, those who have materials contribute materials, those who have equipment help with equipment, and those who have technology support technology. In this way, not only are things done more, done faster, but also done well and done economically. Now, more than 17,000 nurseries (stations) have been established in the city, and the number of children enrolled accounts for 60% of pre-school children; more than 4,600 various life service stations, consignment stores, sporadic household service stations, barber shops, and simple bathrooms. A wide range of life service networks has been formed in industrial and mining areas and major streets. Recently, more than 770 family mutual aid groups have emerged in the city, and they implement sporadic household mutual assistance and cooperation in groups. Eight or ten families form a mutual aid group, regardless of each other, help each other, do cleaning work, take care of children, the elderly, the sick, and people without children, and assist in purchasing supplies, etc., fully promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and love among the masses. This method is being popularized throughout the city.

Another main content of organizing people's economic life in Chongqing City is to vigorously organize the rational distribution of commodities. The principle of rational distribution of commodities in Chongqing City is to take care of key needs (factories and mines) and special needs (the elderly, weak, sick, pregnant women, and disabled) on the basis of ensuring general needs. Commercial department employees often go deep into the masses, fully relying on mass organizations such as mass life service stations, family committees, and people's economic life groups in residential sections, and hold symposiums to listen to residents' opinions as the basis for distributing commodities. Many commercial units, such as the Guojiatuo factory area store and the Chongqing Friendship Store, have recently established "economic household registers" to register in detail the number of households, population, origin, ethnicity, age, health status, pregnant women, and maternity women of consumers in an area. In this way, the store has a more reliable basis. The commercial departments determine the distribution methods according to the amount of goods available and the consumption needs of residents at various times, and distribute some commodities to villages and sections through mass organizations in villages and sections, and deliver goods to their homes. This method of distributing some commodities by following the mass line is very popular among the masses. In addition to the planned and rational distribution of commodities by district stores, there are also a certain number of specialized stores and special flavor restaurants on the main streets of the city and districts, operating tens of thousands of commodities and special flavor dishes and pastries for the masses to choose freely.

Comprehensively organizing people's economic life is a very complex task, and it must take into account the different needs of all aspects. In this regard, Chongqing City is proceeding according to the different characteristics and needs of industrial and mining areas, residential areas, school areas, institutions, and rural areas. The characteristics of industrial and mining areas are large purchasing power, vast and scattered areas, and busy workers in production. In order to meet the needs of this part of the people, trade stores in various industrial and mining areas have generally achieved "more, better, longer, and more complete," that is, more commercial outlets, more family consignment stores, and more temporary supply points; better commodity distribution and better service attitude; longer business hours; and more complete commercial varieties and more complete service items to facilitate employees. They also arrange life according to the needs of various different workers. For example, in order to arrange the lives of single workers, the Guojiatuo Trade Store specially organized residents to establish a single worker service team to sew clothes, wash clothes, boil medicine, and take care of patients for workers. In the female workers' dormitory, the store set up a family consignment store specializing in the sale of women's supplies, which is very popular among the workers. There is a large floating population in the urban area, and the commercial service departments take the hotel as the base to specially arrange accommodation, food and drink, and purchase of train and boat tickets for tourists and business travelers. Many restaurants have special seats for business travelers to facilitate their meals. The Shangqingsi area has the most institutions, and there are many cadres who come here to attend meetings. The Shangqingsi area store specially opened a meeting restaurant and a guest house to serve the cadres who come to attend meetings. Recently, children's barber shops, children's restaurants, etc. have also appeared on the streets of Chongqing, specializing in serving the needs of children; temporary nurseries have been set up near some transportation hubs and entertainment venues to facilitate parents to temporarily entrust children.

After the comprehensive organization of people's economic life, the production enthusiasm of factory and mine employees has become increasingly greater. In particular, after the broad masses of residents and employees' families were organized in production and life, more housewives were freed from the trivial housework, took up various production jobs, and made them feel at ease in production. The more than 200 street factories run by urban residents have become an indispensable new force in the production of small daily necessities, mechanical accessories, and parts. Due to the development of street production work, the income of urban residents has increased, and their lives have been further improved. The Longmenhao area in Nan'an District originally had more than 300 "five guarantees households" who lived on state relief. Now, after the development of street production, their living expenses are all collectively solved by the streets. Some areas have established nursing homes in the streets, and many elderly people are spending happy old age in the nursing homes. The street masses in the city have also self-run 58 primary schools and 36 middle schools, with more than 38,000 students enrolled.

What is particularly gratifying is that in collective production and life, the socialist ideology and communist ideology of the broad masses have been greatly improved. Their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. A new atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance, glorious labor, thrift and frugality, and love for the collective has emerged among the masses. Many places have seen moving deeds of respecting the elderly and loving the young, and helping the sick and saving the wounded. More than 3,300 households in the Guojiatuo factory area automatically formed 238 family life mutual aid groups. In a group, they are not divided from each other, one person helps everyone, everyone helps one person, and arranges the scattered housework of each family in an orderly manner.

    六千家庭妇女走上生产岗位　七千户的家务劳动逐步社会化
    上新街居民创造了集体幸福的新生活
    以地区商店为中心，统一使用财贸部门力量，依靠街道居民群众，全面组织经济生活
    办起九个街道工厂，二十多个公共食堂，三十九个托儿组织，一百二十八个家庭互助组
    重庆全市推广上新街的经验，使全市生产、街道工作和人们的精神面貌都出现了新气象
    新华社重庆10日电　重庆市南岸区上新街党总支委员会以地区商店为中心，集中统一使用财贸部门的力量，广泛依靠街道居民群众，全面组织和安排人民经济生活。
    这个地区的十五个居民段办起了二十多个公共食堂，有90％以上的居民在食堂用饭；建立了托儿所和三十九个托儿站、组、队，形成一个托儿网，入托儿童有三千名，占学龄前儿童总数的80％；建立了三个中心服务站，下设十五个生活服务站和一百二十八个家庭互助组，服务人员达一千多人，构成了一个群众自我服务网，服务项目包括：代销商品，代办运输，代售邮票、书报，代办储蓄，收购废品，修理家具，粉刷房屋，安装电灯和水管，照顾老人、病人、产妇和小孩，做清洁工作等等。商店依靠居民服务站分配某些商品，使供应工作做得更加细致合理。去年通过居民服务站共分配了三十八万多元的商品，占商店营业总额的三分之一。凡属依靠居民服务站分配的货物，都送到居民段，或者送货上门。商业部门还调整和扩大了国营商业、饮食、服务修补行业的业务，增加商品花色品种和服务项目，商店增设了“万能服务部”、“行人休息站”和“开水灶”。二十家国营餐厅、食品店普遍改进了供应工作，代客蒸馒头、炒菜、煮面。小吃馆恢复和增加了一批具有特殊风味的食品和菜肴。缝纫、洗染、修补、理发店也扩大了服务项目。这些都大大便利了群众。
    这个地区全面组织和安排人民经济生活以后，参加生产的居民减轻了家务劳动的负担，更加安心生产。比如，以街道妇女为主兴办的九个街道工厂，工人的出勤率都在93％以上，去年共生产了一百多种产品供应市场，总产值比1958年增加三倍多。居民群众因为参加了生产或街道服务事业，增加了收入，改善了生活。去年这个地区的居民从街道组织的各项生产中共得到了四十五万元的收入。
    居民们从生产和生活上组织起来以后，互相帮助、互相服务的集体主义精神开始形成。妇女张素兰得了瘫痪病，不能劳动，又无亲人照顾。第六居民段的服务员刘秀英就经常为她送饭送水。张素兰感激不尽，请人写出了她内心的几句话：“总路线放光芒，毛主席恩情长，互助组员刘妈妈，送饭送水到我家；无男无女无依靠，邻里骨肉亲如一家。”
    商业部门通过组织人民经济生活，与群众的关系更加密切。每到节日和假日，许多居民积极分子利用空闲时间，自动到商店包装商品、运货、售货，这样，商业部门虽然任务不断增加，供应和服务工作却做得更加深入、细致，经营管理工作也进一步改善。目前这个地区的商业工作人员只占总人口的1．1％。商店去年的劳动生产率比1958年提高了77．66％，全年的销售、购进、费用、资金周转计划都提前四十天完成。
    上新街地区共有居民七千多户、三万二千多人。从大跃进以来，这里办起了九个街道工厂和一支街道运输队。有七千一百多个居民（其中85％是妇女）分别到国营企业、街道工厂和街道运输队参加生产劳动。这样一来，许多原来是家务性的劳动，现在都需要组织社会劳动来代替。根据这种情况，上新街党总支委员会加强了对组织人民经济生活工作的领导，以地区商店为中心，把各财贸单位的工作统一领导起来（各单位的业务同时仍受上级业务部门领导），统一安排，统一行动，改变了过去各财贸单位各有各的办法、各搞各的业务的状况，更好地发挥了它们的力量。街道党组织及时了解各单位职工的政治思想状况，加强对他们的教育，检查和监督他们的工作，保证了组织人民经济生活的工作和其他各项财贸工作不断提高。
    在街道党组织的统一领导下，这个地区从街道行政领导部门到各个居民段、从地区商店到各财贸单位，层层建立了管理人民经济生活的组织机构或设立专人负责，把各个方面的力量拧成一股绳。街道行政领导部门设立了地区人民经济生活委员会，以上新街的地区商店为主，吸收了街道人民代表和妇联、蔬菜商店、煤炭商店、食品商店、粮站、银行、主要工厂、机关、学校、公共食堂的负责人等参加。街道行政领导部门和地区商店负责干部分别担任正、副主任委员。委员会的具体工作是：调查和研究群众的需要，合理设置商业、服务网点，确定商品分配的范围和分配原则，研究兴办有关集体福利事业和交流这方面的经验，领导群众发展副食品生产等。委员会还设立办公室，由街道行政领导部门和地区商店派干部办公。上新街的地区商店内部成立了人民经济生活指挥部，配备干部，了解群众需要，密切配合地区人民经济生活委员会进行工作，负责指导街道办的服务性事业和福利事业。
    街道服务事业和福利事业，都是通过发动群众、大搞群众运动的办法来进行的。群众在建立街道公共食堂、托儿网和生活服务网，得到了街道行政领导部门和地区人民经济生活委员会以及街道妇联等群众组织的领导和帮助。生活服务站固定在各家服务的家庭服务员，是由居民自愿报名，由人民经济生活委员会统一安排确定的，她们中绝大部分是老年妇女，没有直接参加生产劳动。职工和居民在举办这些事业中，也得到了地区商店和其他商店、银行、粮站等单位密切协作，并且从物资、技术等方面大力支援。比如地区人民经济生活委员会帮助居民办起二十多个公共食堂以后，地区商店开办了炊事人员训练班，训练居民公共食堂的炊事员，还派出厨师到公共食堂传授烹调技术；粮站帮助食堂安排用粮；煤炭商店指导食堂改进炉灶，节约燃煤，蔬菜和食品商店职工经常帮助食堂安排菜谱，想各种办法供应食堂需要的副食品。这样，群众在食堂里吃饭能省粮、省钱、吃饱、吃好，用膳人数陆续增加。商店积极从物资、设备、商品供应上支持和帮助托儿所，通过业务技术指导和代销商品，支持生活服务站，使这些组织巩固下来。
    在组织人民经济生活的过程中，上新街的地区商店也积极改进了本身的业务。首先，进一步作好合理分配某些商品的工作。地区商店专管人民经济生活的售货员，分片包干，深入各居民段，依靠居民委员会、居民生活服务站等组织，挨家挨户了解情况，掌握各类人员的消费水平和生活习惯。一般售货员能做到了三知（知分配户数、人数、地点）、四熟
  （熟悉供应地区、供应对象、生活习惯、消费水平）、二及时（及时了解需要、及时分配）。在分配前，通过各居民服务站召开居民座谈会，宣传了分配原则。在分配中，特别照顾了老、幼、病、孕妇等人的需要。其次，扩大供应机构和服务机构，增加商品品种和服务项目，更加便利群众。（上新街全面组织人民经济生活的详细情况见今日第七版）
    新华社重庆10日电　重庆市在党委统一领导下，依靠广大群众组织人民经济生活，已经由点到面全面展开。由于这一工作的深入开展，全市生产、街道工作和人们精神面貌，都出现了新的气象。
    重庆市组织人民经济生活的工作是1958年首先在上新街开展起来的。大跃进以来，各街道大批劳动力参加了国营工厂生产；半劳动力和辅助劳动力，也纷纷组织起来进行副食品生产、小商品生产和发展修配业务。广大居民特别是家庭妇女走上了生产岗位以后，原来由每个家庭自己解决的家务事情，现在就变成了社会性的问题，群众迫切要求党和政府领导他们组织起来管好生活。针对这一新的情况，重庆市在党委统一领导下，以财贸部门和街道行政领导部门为主，配合民政部门、妇联等单位一齐动手，以帮助群众办好集体食堂为中心，大办生活福利事业。食堂办得好坏，关系群众生活最大，财贸部门不仅从政治思想、设备、烹调技术、货源、建立管理制度方面给予很大的帮助，而且帮助集体食堂设立小食部和小卖部、开水灶、简易浴室、茶园等。现在一般食堂都办得比较好，服务质量不断提高，受到群众的欢迎。全市已办起了集体食堂二万七千多个，搭伙人数一般地区占总人数的80％，多的占90％以上。
    在帮助群众兴办生活福利事业中，全市各地区都采取了“群众的事群众办，大家的事大家管”的办法，组织和发展群众自我服务和生活互助。群众的热情很高，有人的出人，有材料的出材料，有设备的帮助设备，有技术的支援技术。这样不仅事情办得多、办得快，而且办得好，办得省。现在全市办了托儿所（站）一万七千多个，入托儿童占学前儿童60％；各种生活服务站、代销店、零星家务服务站、理发室、简易浴室四千六百多处。在工矿区和主要街道上已经形成了一个广泛的生活服务网。最近，全市又出现了七百七十多个家庭互助组，他们以组为单位，实行零星家务互助合作。八家、十家人组成一个互助组，不分彼此，相互帮助，做好清洁工作，照料小孩、老人、病人、无儿无女的人，协助采购用品等，充分发扬了群众中的互助互爱精神。这种办法正在全市普及。
    重庆市组织人民经济生活的另一主要内容是，大力组织商品的合理分配。重庆市合理分配商品的原则是在保证一般需要的基础上，照顾重点需要（厂矿）和特殊需要（老、弱、病、孕妇、残废）。商业部门职工经常深入群众，充分依靠群众生活服务站、家属委员会和居民段的人民经济生活小组等群众组织，召开座谈会，听取居民意见，作为分配商品的依据，郭家沱厂区商店、重庆市友谊商店等不少商业单位，最近还建立了“经济户籍册”，把一个地区的消费者的户数、人口、籍贯、民族、年龄、健康状况、孕妇、产妇都详细登记入册。这样，商店就有了更可靠的依据。商业部门根据各个时期的货源多少、居民消费需要，确定分配办法，把一部分商品，通过村段的群众组织分配到村段，送货到家。这种走群众路线分配一部分商品的办法，很受群众欢迎。除地区商店有计划地合理分配商品外，市和区的主要街道上，还有一定数量的专业商店、特殊风味馆，经营数以万计的商品特殊风味的菜肴糕点，让群众自由选购。
    全面组织人民经济生活是一件十分复杂的工作，它要照顾各方面的不同需要。在这方面，重庆市是根据工矿区、居民区、学校区、机关和农村的不同特点和需要进行的。工矿区的特点是购买力大，地区辽阔分散，工人生产很忙。为了满足这部分人的需要，各工矿区贸易商店普遍做到了“多、好、长、全”，即商业网点多、家属代销店多，临时供应点多；商品分配好、服务态度好，营业时间长；商业品品种全、服务项目全，以方便职工。他们还根据各种不同工人的需要安排生活。如郭家沱贸易商店为了安排单身工人的生活，专门组织居民建立单身工人服务队，为工人缝衣、洗衣、熬药，照顾病人。在女工宿舍里，商店建立家属代销店，专门销售妇女用品，很受工人欢迎。城区流动人口多，商业服务部门就以旅馆为基点，专门安排旅客和出差人员的住宿、吃喝和购买车船票等问题，许多餐厅专设出差人员席，方便他们吃饭。上清寺地区机关最多，到这里开会的干部特别多，上清寺地区商店特地开办会议餐厅、迎宾馆，为前来开会的干部服务。最近，在重庆大街上还出现了儿童理发室、儿童餐厅等，专为儿童需要服务；在部分交通要道和娱乐场所附近设立了临时托儿站，方便父母临时有事寄托儿童。
    全面组织人民经济生活以后，厂矿职工的生产干劲越来越大。特别是广大居民群众和职工家属从生产上和生活上组织起来以后，使更多的家庭妇女摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，走上了各种生产岗位，并使她们安心生产。城区居民办的二百多家街道工厂，已经成了生产日用小商品、机械配件、零件方面不可缺少的一支新生力量。由于街道生产工作的发展，城市居民的收入增加，生活进一步得到改善。南岸区龙门浩地区原来有三百多家“五保户”，都靠国家救济过生活，现在街道生产发展后，他们的生活费用全部由街道集体解决了。有些地区街道兴办了敬老院，许多老人在敬老院里度着幸福的晚年。全市街道群众还自办了五十八所小学、三十六所中学，入学学生达三万八千多人。
    特别令人欣喜的是在集体生产和生活中，广大群众的社会主义思想和共产主义思想觉悟大大提高。他们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，在群众中出现了团结互助、劳动光荣、勤俭节约、热爱集体的新风尚，不少地方出现了尊老爱幼，扶病救伤的感人事迹。郭家沱厂区三千三百多户家属自动组成了二百三十八个家庭生活互助组，在一个组里不分彼此，一人帮大家，大家帮一人，把各家的零星家务安排得有条有理。
