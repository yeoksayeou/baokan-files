    U.S. Military Policy and Arms Enterprises

    Editor's Note: "U.S. News & World Report" published an article on February 22 discussing the impact of adjustments in U.S. military strategy on arms production. From this article, one can also see the current U.S. trend of expanding military strength with a focus on developing missiles. Excerpts are translated below:

    In the debate regarding America’s future defense, there is an unanswered question: what impact will the changes in U.S. military policy have on defense enterprises?

    In an attempt to answer this question, "U.S. News & World Report" interviewed relevant government and corporate parties. The answer is: both the expenditure guidelines for defense funds and their implementation will undergo significant changes.

    Military spending for the coming year will be approximately $41 billion, roughly the same as last year. According to current plans, military spending will remain close to this level in the coming years. However, the companies receiving orders will change.

    Reducing Aircraft, Increasing Missile Production The days of the aviation industry producing thousands of aircraft annually are over. The 1961 federal budget stipulates that the Air Force will only purchase 633 aircraft, including improved B-52 heavy bombers, B-58 supersonic medium bombers, F-105 supersonic bomber-fighters, as well as transport aircraft and jet refueling aircraft.

    The production of the B-70 long-range bomber has been reduced to two experimental aircraft, with their test flights expected to take place in 1963.

    Large aircraft companies are securing some missile business, but they must share it with other industrial enterprises, such as those in electronic computing and electrical engineering. Some aircraft manufacturing enterprises have broken themselves up into smaller units and dispersed into electronic industrial enterprises in order to manufacture the navigation and control equipment required for missiles.

    Expanding Submarines An authoritative source in the Department of Defense believes that in the next five years, the United States will spend $1.75 billion annually on the construction of new naval vessels. This figure may increase to $2.5 billion.

    Currently, the U.S. Navy possesses 386 combat vessels and 474 support vessels. In the coming years, the main expenditures for the Navy will be invested in submarine construction. According to the 1961 military budget, the U.S. will build three more "Polaris"-type ballistic missile submarines and has begun the preliminary construction work on another three submarines of the same type. Naval authorities claim that by 1965, twenty-five "Polaris"-type ballistic missile submarines will be incorporated into active service.

    Therefore, shipbuilding companies can expect to continue receiving as much business from the government as before.

    The Army's Shopping List For the Army and Marine Corps, new types of missiles and rockets for tactical use are increasingly important. The Army and Marine Corps' shopping lists also include new rifles and machine guns, whose ammunition is standard ammunition that can be used by all troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The shopping list also includes M-60 tanks, M-113 armored personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers, trucks, and jeeps.

    In total, approximately four million people—about 7% of the total U.S. workforce—are directly employed in defense-related occupations. In the future, this total number may not change much, but with changes in defense spending, the need for workers in some enterprises will decrease, while the need for workers in others will increase.

### 美国军事政策与军火企业

    美国军事政策与军火企业
    编者按　“美国新闻与世界报道”2月22日一期刊载了一篇文章，谈到美国调整军事策略对军火生产将发生的影响。从这篇文章中也可以看到美国目前以发展导弹为重点的扩充军事力量的动向。现摘译如后：
    在有关美国未来防务问题的争论中，有一个没有解答的问题，美国军事政策正经历着变化，这些变化对于国防企业会有什么影响？
    为了试图解答这个问题，“美国新闻与世界报道”访问了政府与企业有关方面。答案是：国防经费的开支方针及其实施均将有显著的改变。
    未来一年的军事开支约为四百一十亿美元，总数与去年相近。根据目前的计划，今后数年的军事开支均将接近这个水平。但是获得订货合同的企业将有所变动。
    减少飞机、增产导弹　航空工业每年生产成千上万架飞机的日子已经过去了。1961年度联邦预算规定空军只采购六百三十三架飞机，其中包括改进了的B—52重型轰炸机、B—58超音速中型轰炸机、F—105超音速轰炸—战斗机以及运输机、喷气式加油飞机。
    B—70远程轰炸机的生产已经削减为两架试验用飞机，而它们的试飞预计在1963年举行。
    大的飞机公司正在取得一些导弹生意，不过它们必须与一些其他的工业企业例如电子计算、电气等企业分沾。有些飞机制造企业已经化整为零，分散到电子工业企业里去，以便制造导弹所需要的导航和控制设备。
    扩充潜水艇　国防部某权威人士认为，今后五年内，美国每年在海军新舰只的建造上将花十七亿五千万美元。这个数字可能增为二十五亿美元。
    目前，美国海军拥有三百八十六艘作战舰只、四百七十四艘支援舰只。未来数年中，海军主要开支将投入潜水艇建造。根据1961年度军事预算，美国将再建造三艘“北极星式”弹道导弹潜水艇，并开始了同一类型另外三艘潜水艇的初步建造工程。海军权威人士称，1965年将有二十五艘“北极星式”弹道导弹潜水艇编入现役。
    因此，造船公司可望继续从政府得到与从前一样多的生意。
    陆军的购货单　对于陆军及海军陆战队说来，作为战术使用的新型导弹及火箭日益重要。陆军及海军陆战队的购货单上，也有新式步枪和机关枪，这些枪枝的弹药是北大西洋公约组织一切部队可以使用的标准弹药。购货单上还有M—60坦克、M—113装甲运输车、自行推进的榴弹炮、货车、吉普车。
    总的算来，大约有四百万人——约占美国工人总数的7％——的职业直接与防务有关。在未来的日子里，这个总数的变化可能不大，但是随着国防开支的变动，某些企业对工人的需要将要减少，而另一些企业的这种需要则要增加。
