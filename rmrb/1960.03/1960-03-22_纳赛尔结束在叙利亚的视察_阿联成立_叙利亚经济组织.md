Comprehensive report from our newspaper:

    UAR President Nasser returned to Cairo on the evening of the 19th, after spending more than a month in the Syrian region.

    During this period, the President conducted extensive inspections and delivered numerous speeches. He also studied the political and economic problems of the region.

    Before leaving the Syrian region, President Nasser appointed seven new ministers to the Syrian Regional Executive Council.

    Nasser announced at a meeting that the UAR would establish only one National Assembly, instead of separate Syrian regional and Egyptian regional assemblies.

    In addition, on March 16th, President Nasser also announced in Damascus the formal establishment of the "Syrian Economic Organization." Like the "Economic Organization" established in the Egyptian region in 1957, this organization is under the leadership of the President.

    According to this decision, the capital of the "Syrian Economic Organization" includes the public shares in existing or soon-to-be-established joint ventures for economic development, as well as the capital of public institutions engaged in commerce, industry, agriculture, and real estate designated by the President.

    The decision also stipulates that the purpose of the "Syrian Economic Organization" is to "promote the development of national income through the economic activities of the public sector." It may enter into loan agreements with governments, public institutions, banks, or private organizations, as well as with foreign governments and organizations and international organizations. It may issue public bonds "domestically and abroad within the UAR" in order to obtain the necessary funding for its activities.

    The decision stipulates that the organization will have representatives on the boards of directors of the companies in which it invests.

    According to the Middle East News Agency, the "Syrian Economic Organization" will initially participate in the operation of textile companies, oil companies, cement companies, and banks and insurance companies in the Syrian region.

    纳赛尔结束在叙利亚的视察
    阿联成立“叙利亚经济组织”
    本报综合报道　阿联总统纳赛尔在叙利亚地区停留一个多月以后19日晚上回到开罗。
    纳赛尔是2月14日前往叙利亚地区的。在这期间，总统进行了广泛的视察，并且发表了很多次演说。他还研究了这个地区的政治和经济问题。
    纳赛尔总统在离开叙利亚地区以前，曾任命了叙利亚地区行政委员会的七名新部长。
    纳赛尔在一个会议上宣布，阿联将只成立一个国民议会，不分别设立叙利亚地区议会和埃及地区议会。
    此外，在3月16日，纳赛尔总统还在大马士革宣布正式成立“叙利亚经济组织”。这个组织同埃及地区1957年成立的“经济组织”一样，归总统领导。
    根据这项决定，“叙利亚经济组织”的资本包括现有的或即将为发展经济而成立的合营公司中的公股部分以及由总统决定所指定的经营商业、工业、农业和地产业的公有机构的资本。
    这项决定还规定，“叙利亚经济组织”的目的是“通过公有部分的经济活动以促进国民收入的发展”。它可以同政府、公共机构、银行或私人组织签订贷款协定，也可以同外国政府和组织以及国际组织签订贷款协定。它可以“在阿联国内和国外”发行公债，以便为它的活动取得必要的经费。
    决定规定，这个组织将有代表参加它所投资的公司的董事会。
    据中东通讯社报道，“叙利亚经济组织”将首先参与经营叙利亚地区的纺织公司、石油公司、水泥公司以及银行和保险公司等。
