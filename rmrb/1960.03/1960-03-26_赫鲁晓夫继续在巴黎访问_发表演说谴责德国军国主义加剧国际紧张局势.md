Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 25th -- According to TASS: On March 24th, after Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev met with French President de Gaulle, he attended a luncheon hosted in his honor by French Prime Minister Debré.

In the afternoon, Khrushchev attended a reception held by the Paris Municipal Council to welcome him.

From Khrushchev's residence along the banks of the Seine to the square of the City Hall, crowds of welcomers lined the streets. The cold wind and rain did not diminish the enthusiasm of the thousands of Parisians. They waited for Khrushchev in the square for more than two hours. The windows and eaves of the buildings around the square were filled with people. People held aloft the French and Soviet flags, shouting slogans of "Friendship," "Khrushchev - Peace," and "Salute to Khrushchev."

French Prime Minister Debré, Chairman of the Paris Municipal Council de Vregille, and more than two thousand guests attended the reception. At the meeting, de Vregille delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Paris Municipal Council to Khrushchev.

After Debré spoke, Khrushchev delivered a speech.

Khrushchev first expressed his gratitude to the French people for their warm welcome. He spoke about the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy. He said: Can there be any doubt that a country, a government, and a people that are implementing such a truly extraordinary plan of economic construction are vitally concerned about preventing war?

He emphasized the importance of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, the prohibition of nuclear and rocket weapons, and ensuring lasting and consolidated peace in the world. He pointed out that last autumn, the Soviet government put forward a proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly. In recent years, the Soviet Union has unilaterally implemented measures to greatly reduce its armed forces. He went on to say that disarmament is also entirely in the national interest of France and in accordance with the wishes of the French people.

Khrushchev then spoke about the German question, saying that it is one of the most pressing international issues. The Soviet Union, concerned with safeguarding peace in Europe, has pointed out more than once that the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys is an important step on the road to resolving the German question.

Khrushchev said: German militarism is pursuing a policy of aggravating international tensions and obstructing the settlement of disputes and outstanding issues. We are concerned about the intolerable attitude of condoning the rise of German militarism, especially the attitude of colluding with it.

If German militarism is allowed to manufacture and use thermonuclear and rocket weapons, the dangerous consequences of doing so are incalculable. History teaches us that some politicians were too slow to recognize the German militarists in the beginning.

Khrushchev pointed out that history shows that Soviet-French relations have had a tradition of friendship and cooperation in the past. The alliance between the two countries was based on common interests, the geographical location of the two countries, and the need to defend peace in Europe. In the past, whenever the Franco-Soviet alliance existed, the security of the two countries was strengthened, and when this alliance disappeared, the national interests of the Soviet Union and France were harmed more than once.

Khrushchev said that the French and Soviet peoples have every possibility to join hands in building a beautiful edifice of peace.

In the evening, Khrushchev hosted a banquet at the Soviet delegation's residence, the French Foreign Ministry building, in honor of French President de Gaulle. French Prime Minister Debré, Foreign Minister Couve de Murville, and other French officials also attended the banquet.

    赫鲁晓夫继续在巴黎访问
    发表演说谴责德国军国主义加剧国际紧张局势
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：24日苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同法国总统戴高乐会谈以后，出席了法国总理德勃雷为他举行的午宴。
    下午赫鲁晓夫出席了巴黎市政委员会为欢迎他而举行的招待会。
    从赫鲁晓夫的住所沿着塞纳河两岸到市政厅广场，一路上排列着欢迎的人群。寒风和冷雨没有降低成千上万的巴黎人的热情。他们在广场上等候赫鲁晓夫两个多小时。广场四周房屋的窗台上和屋檐上都是人群。人们高举着法国和苏联国旗，高呼着“友谊”、“赫鲁晓夫——和平”、“向赫鲁晓夫致敬”的口号。
    法国总理德勃雷、巴黎市政委员会主席德弗莱?和二千多客人出席了这个招待会。在会上，德弗莱?代表巴黎市政委员会向赫鲁晓夫致欢迎词。
    在德勃雷讲话以后，赫鲁晓夫发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫首先对法国人民对他的盛情欢迎表示感谢。他谈到苏联发展国民经济的七年计划。他说：在执行如此真正不平凡的经济建设计划的国家、政府和人民，切身关心不让战争发生，这难道还会有疑问吗？
    他强调不同社会制度国家的和平共处，禁止核武器和火箭武器，保证世界持久的巩固的和平的重要性。他指出去年秋天苏联政府在联合国大会第十四届会议上提出了全面彻底裁军的建议。近年来，苏联单方面地实行了大大裁减自己武装部队的措施。他接着说，裁军也完全符合法国的国家利益，符合法国人民的愿望。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到德国问题，他说，这是刻不容缓的国际问题之一。关心维护欧洲和平的苏联曾经不止一次地指出，同两个德国缔结和约是解决德国问题道路上的重要步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫说：德国军国主义在实行加剧国际紧张局势和阻挠争端和悬而未决的问题的解决的方针。那种纵容德国军国主义抬头的令人不能容忍的态度、特别是与它同谋的态度使我们感到担心。
    如果让德国军国主义有可能制造和使用热核武器和火箭武器，那么，这样做的危险后果是难以估计的。历史教导我们，某些政治家当初对德国军国主义者识破得太晚了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，历史表明，苏法两国的关系在过去有一种友好和合作的传统。两国的联盟是出于共同的利益，出于两国的地理位置和保卫欧洲和平的必要。过去，每当法苏联盟存在的时候，两国的安全就得到加强，而当这种联盟消失的时候，苏联和法国的民族利益不止一次地受到损害。
    赫鲁晓夫说，法国人民和苏联人民有一切可能共同携起手来建设美好的和平大厦。
    晚间赫鲁晓夫在苏联代表团的住所、法国外交部大厦举行宴会招待法国总统戴高乐。法国总理德勃雷、外交部长德姆维尔和法国其他官方人士也出席了宴会。
