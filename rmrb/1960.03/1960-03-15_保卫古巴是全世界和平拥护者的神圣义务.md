Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 13th: Mrs. Yves Farge, member of the World Peace Council and member of the Presidium of the French National Peace Council, yesterday evening at a public gathering held to close the Latin American Conference for Peace, awarded silver medals on behalf of the World Peace Council to Juan Marinello, an outstanding Cuban peace fighter, Dr. Marta Freide, President of the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and National Sovereignty, and Eduardo Corona, a well-known jurist.

Marinello spoke on behalf of the award recipients at the award ceremony. He said that the Cuban people will redouble their efforts to defend peace and Cuban sovereignty. He said that if the bellicose American imperialists dare to implement their plan to invade Cuba, the Cuban people, with the support of the people of all countries, will know how to defeat them.

The Latin American Conference for Peace, which opened on the 9th, closed on the 11th. Representatives of Latin American countries participating in the conference spoke at the public gathering, expressing the increasingly strong determination of all Latin American people to support and stand with the Cuban Revolution.

Chishikvazde, member of the World Peace Council and Director of the Law Department of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, announced at the public gathering on behalf of the World Peace Council that defending the Cuban Revolution is the sacred duty of peace advocates worldwide.

Abdel Khandri, representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, thanked the conference for passing a resolution on supporting the Algerian people's struggle for independence and paid tribute to the Cuban Revolution in his speech.

The representatives attending the conference laid a wreath in Havana Bay yesterday at noon to commemorate the victims of the "La Coubre" ship explosion.

Comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Cuban Workers' Federation has continuously received letters and telegrams from various countries condemning the crime of sabotaging the "La Coubre" ship.

The telegram from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which has 87 million members, stated: "We express our utmost indignation at the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. World public opinion supports the heroic struggle of Cuban workers against monopoly groups. These monopoly groups are desperately struggling to destroy the Cuban Revolution."

The Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions, in a telegram to the Cuban Workers' Federation, assured the Cuban working people on behalf of the Albanian working people that they would fully support the Cuban people's struggle to consolidate the victory of the revolution.

The Cuban Workers' Federation also received telegrams from the Free German Trade Union Federation and the Federation for Solidarity with Free Latin America, headquartered in Miami, expressing support for the Cuban Revolution.

Comprehensive report: People and public opinion in Latin American countries have condemned the US interference and threats against Cuba, and supported the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution.

The Argentine Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution held a rally in Buenos Aires on the 8th to support the Cuban Revolution.

Participants in the meeting included representatives from various trade unions, the Argentine University Student Federation, the Communist Party's youth organization, the Socialist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the youth organization of the People's Radical Civic Union, the opposition of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union, and other people's organizations. It was decided to promote the achievements of the Cuban Revolution through round table meetings, film screenings, and other means; special gatherings will be held in rural areas to explain Cuba's land reform. The meeting unanimously decided to launch a donation campaign to purchase tractors to help Cuba carry out land reform.

According to Latin American News Agency from Tegucigalpa, at the Honduran Parliament meeting on the 11th, some congressmen expressed support for Cuba's position, opposing the preparation of anti-Cuban aggression plans on Honduran territory. That day, when a so-called government committee "investigating" the anti-Cuban conspiracy came to the House of Representatives to read its report, the congressmen shouted slogans "Long live Cuba!" and "Long live Castro!"

The speeches by Bueso and Falco were supported by other congressmen.

According to TASS reporter Pavlenko's report from Mexico on the 13th: Mexican newspapers have recently published many articles condemning the US threats against Cuba and the US interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Cuba. Most articles warn that the US direct opposition to Cuba will have serious consequences for the United States, because the Cuban Revolution is supported by the people of Latin American countries.

"Mexico Daily" published an article by Carrion, a leader of the People's Party, who wrote, "Cuba stands at the forefront. Defending Cuba means defending the future of the entire Latin American democratic revolution."

"People's Daily" published a series of articles by the famous journalist Favela on the relationship between Cuba and the United States. The author warned that if the US ruling group's clamor for direct action against Cuba is put into practice, "then a huge wave of anger will sweep through the people of Latin American countries and other continents, and it is impossible to predict what consequences this will have for the United States."

The Colombian "Democratic Call" published a commentary on the 10th titled "Despite US conspiracies of terrorism, the Cuban Revolution will never retreat." The commentary condemned US imperialism's involvement in the "La Coubre" ship explosion.

The commentary said, "Officials of the US State Department were involved in this explosion case. They opposed Britain selling planes to Cuba to defend the revolution, and they pressured the Belgian government, attempting to force it not to sell the weapons that were unloaded from the 'La Coubre' ship this time. All of this was planned under the attempt to prevent the Cuban Revolution from defending itself."

The commentary pointed out: "But those who think they can destroy the revolution are wrong, because as Castro said in these words that reflect the people's feelings: Those who attempt to annex us should know that on this land of Cuba, we will fight to the last drop of blood."

According to Xinhua News Agency, March 14th, New York: The US "Worker's Weekly" published an article entitled "Ike Returns from Visit, Threatens Cuba," saying that Eisenhower's television speech after visiting South America was "an almost undisguised threat to Cuba or any other Latin American people who have established a government that does not please the State Department." The article stated, "If the State Department considers such a government 'despotic' - in other words, if this government completes land reform or restrains the arbitrary actions of foreign monopoly capital organizations - Washington will immediately exert pressure and carry out armed, political, or economic intervention." This article by Huarez was published in the March 13th issue of "Worker's Weekly."

The article continued: Eisenhower's speech during his visit to South America "was general and routine, with only two repeated arguments as exceptions: one was to hold out hope for peace, that disarmament would benefit all countries (while at the same time threatening to interfere in any Latin American country attempting to break free from imperialist exploitation). The other main argument was that if these countries need loans, they have to accept the extremely unreasonable conditions offered to them, which generally means handing over their economies to US imperialism."

The article said: "As long as imperialism manipulates their economies, the wealth of their countries will be increasingly depleted, and the people of Latin American countries will live miserable lives." The article went on to point out, "Because the workers and peasants of Latin America know that the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are building affluent economies for their people at a very fast pace, they will strengthen their militancy and will fight for considerably better living conditions."

    据拉丁美洲通讯社自特古西加尔巴报道，在洪都拉斯议会11日的会议上，一些议员表示支持古巴的立场，他们反对在洪都拉斯的领土上准备反古巴的侵略计划。这一天当一个所谓“调查”反古巴阴谋的政府委员会到众议院来宣读它的报告时，众议员们高呼“古巴万岁！”和“卡斯特罗万岁！”的口号。
    布埃索和法耳科在会上的发言得到了其他众议员的支持。
    据塔斯社记者巴甫连科13日发自墨西哥的报道：墨西哥报纸最近登载了许多谴责美国威胁古巴和美国干涉古巴共和国内政的文章。大多数文章都警告说，美国直接反对古巴的行为将给美国带来严重的后果，因为古巴革命受到拉丁美洲各国人民的支持。
    “墨西哥日报”发表了一篇人民党领导人卡里翁的文章，他写道，“古巴站在先锋地位。保卫古巴，就意味着保卫整个拉丁美洲民主革命的前途”。
    “人民报”发表了著名的记者法维拉的关于古巴和美国之间关系的一系列文章。作者警告说，如果美国统治集团对古巴采取直接行动的叫嚣付诸实现的话，“那么一个巨大的愤怒的浪潮将席卷拉丁美洲各国人民和其他大陆，并且不能预料，这对美国将产生怎样的后果”。
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”10日发表一篇评论，题目是“尽管美国阴谋进行恐怖活动，古巴革命决不退却”。这篇评论谴责美帝国主义参与了“勒库布尔号”轮船的爆炸事件案件。
    评论说，“美国国务院的官员参与了这次爆炸案，他们曾反对英国把飞机卖给古巴用来保卫革命，并且曾向比利时政府施加压力，企图迫使它不卖那些这次从‘勒库布尔号’轮船卸下的武器。所有这一切都是在不许古巴革命进行自卫的企图下策动的。”
    评论指出：“但是，那些认为可以摧毁革命的人想错了，因为正如卡斯特罗在这些反映人民感情的话里所说的那样：那些企图吞并我们的家伙应该知道，在古巴这块土地上，我们将战斗到最后一滴血。”
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”发表题为“艾克访问归来，威胁古巴”的文章说，艾森豪威尔在访问南美后发表的电视演说是“对古巴或任何建立了不合国务院心意的政府的其他拉丁美洲人民，进行几乎是没有掩盖的威胁。”文章说，“如果国务院认为这样的政府是‘专制的’，换句话说，如果这个政府完成土改或者约束外国垄断资本组织的独断独行，华盛顿就会马上施加压力，进行武装的、政治的或者是经济的干涉。”这篇胡亚雷斯写的文章，发表在3月13日出版的“工人周报”上。
    文章接着说：艾森豪威尔在访问南美时所作的演说，“是笼统和老一套的，只有两个反复申述的论点是例外：一点是对和平抱有希望，裁军会给各国带来好处（与此同时，又扬言要干涉对企图摆脱帝国主义剥削的任何拉丁美洲国家）。另一个主要的论点是，如果这些国家需要贷款，它们得接受向它们提出的极不合理的条件，这些条件总的说来就是把它们的经济交给美国帝国主义。”
    文章说：“只要帝国主义操纵着他们的经济，他们国家的财富将日益枯竭，拉丁美洲各国人民就将过悲惨的日子”。文章接着指出，“由于拉丁美洲的工人和农民知道苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家正以很快的速度为自己的人民建立富足的经济，他们将加强他们的斗争性并将为争取相当好的生活条件而斗争。”
