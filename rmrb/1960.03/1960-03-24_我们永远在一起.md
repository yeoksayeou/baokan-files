We Will Always Be Together
Liu Changsheng, Head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation
Li Zhuchen, Deputy Head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation

Our delegation from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, upon invitation from the Soviet Union, attended the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance as representatives of Chinese workers, youth, women, industrialists and businessmen, scientists, writers, artists, and journalists. During the two weeks from February 9th to 24th, we met with leaders from various aspects of the Soviet Party, government, and people's organizations, lived among the broad masses of the Soviet people, and celebrated the great festival with them, feeling boundless honor and excitement.

We deeply understand that the alliance between China and the Soviet Union, two socialist powers led by the working class and guided by Marxism-Leninism, is an event of great historical significance in the 1950s. The unity of our two peoples is an invincible force. The facts of the past ten years have proven that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played an extremely significant role in the development of China and the Soviet Union, in defending world peace, and in promoting the cause of human progress. The second decade has already begun, and we can fully expect that this treaty will continue to exert an extremely significant and far-reaching influence on promoting the development of history in the future.

To commemorate this great festival, our two countries simultaneously launched large-scale celebrations and sent delegations to each other. The Soviet Union sent a delegation from the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association headed by Comrade Yelyutin. After they arrived in China, they were warmly welcomed by our people. Similarly, our delegation from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was also warmly welcomed by the Soviet people.

During these two weeks, we lived in an atmosphere filled with fraternal friendship, just like being in our own home. We received very friendly and enthusiastic reception from all aspects of the Soviet Union. Soviet Party and government leaders Suslov and Kozlov received us in the Kremlin. Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Ehefeld; Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, Bobrovnikov; Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, Andreyev; and Chairman of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Popova, and Vice-Chairman Gorshkov also received us separately. The Soviet leaders emphasized that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is eternal and unbreakable, and that we should maintain and strengthen this friendship.

During our stay in Moscow, all members of our delegation participated in the grand celebration meeting held in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building, and also participated in celebration meetings of many organizations, groups, factories, and schools. At all the celebration meetings, speakers narrated the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, spoke about the great development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples since the victory of the October Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, and pointed out that the Sino-Soviet alliance is a model of new international relations. During our stay in Moscow, we also participated in a meeting with activists of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association at the Friendship Palace, and held a discussion with old veterans of the Russian Revolution – veteran Bolsheviks with outstanding achievements – at the Museum of the Revolution.

Our delegation also visited the sunny Azerbaijan Republic and its capital, Baku. During the visit, we met with responsible comrades of the local Party and government, workers, collective farm members, and representatives of the cultural circles. When we arrived in Baku, it coincided with the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, Akhundov, and many leading comrades received us during their busy schedule. The Baku celebration meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the 14th, but the people of Baku changed it to the evening of the 15th to wait for us to participate. That was a grand celebration meeting. During the four days in Azerbaijan, we made many visits. In addition to Baku, we visited Sumgait and Kuba District. Wherever we went, we held get-togethers and discussions with the local Soviet brothers and sisters and participated in their celebrations.

Judging only from the activities we came into contact with, it is imaginable that the Soviet people are very enthusiastic and widely engaged in celebrating this great festival.

During this visit, the Soviet people's friendship and love for the Chinese people left a deep impression on us.

Whether in Moscow, Baku, or the newly established industrial city of Sumgait, we met many old friends or new friends every day, and heard many touching words from Soviet friends every day.

When we visited the Likhachev Automobile Plant in Moscow, the worker comrades welcomed us with warm applause wherever we went, and everyone greeted each other. There, we met Comrade Glaskov, an engineer who had worked in China. He said to us in Chinese: "Soviets don't understand Chinese, and Chinese don't understand Soviet, that doesn't matter, because our hearts are the same." During our stay in Moscow, we participated in a celebration reception held by Ambassador Liu Xiao at the new Chinese Embassy. Our new embassy is located in the Lenin Hills area, next to the famous Moscow University. The architecture is magnificent and has a strong Chinese national character. It is the most beautiful foreign embassy in Moscow. This building, built by the hands of the Soviet working people on Friendship Road, is the crystallization of the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The Azerbaijan Republic, located on the shores of the Caspian Sea, although far away from our country, has a long history of friendly relations between us. In the twelfth century, the great Azerbaijani poet Nizami praised the Chinese people in his famous works. Among the famous modern Azerbaijani poets, almost none have not written about China.

The fighting and unbreakable friendship between our two peoples is often praised by the Soviet people. At a mass meeting in Sumgait, an expert who had returned from China emphasized in his speech, "The Soviet people will always be with the Chinese people, whether in peaceful times or in harsh years." At the No. 1 Middle School in Sumgait, children gathered to welcome us and put red scarves on each of us. A teacher said passionately at the meeting, "For ten years, the friendship between our two countries has been as solid as marble and as bright as the sun."

We not only met many people who had supported our socialist construction—Soviet experts—but also met many people who had visited China (including travelers). They not only loved China, but were also active propagandists of the various construction achievements of New China. Many Soviet comrades told us that they regarded visiting China as an honor. Many comrades recalled their unforgettable impressions of New China and talked about how they wrote articles and gave reports to promote our country's construction achievements after returning to the Soviet Union. During the festival, we encountered the famous Soviet ballerina Lebeshinskaya many times. She is an active propagandist of Sino-Soviet friendship, and her speeches everywhere were warmly welcomed.

Many Soviet friends entrusted us to send greetings to Chairman Mao. Soviet People's Artist and famous Azerbaijani singer Bulbul (meaning "Nightingale") told us before leaving: "Please convey my heartfelt respect to the great son of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong." Soviet children also know Chairman Mao. On the plane from Moscow to Baku, we saw a lively and strong little boy of about three or four years old. At that time, the child pointed at us and asked: "Who are they?" His father said: "They are Chinese." The child happily exclaimed: "Ah! Relatives of Mao Zedong!"

We went to the Soviet Union with the friendship of the Chinese people, and now we are returning to our motherland full of the friendship of the Soviet people. We will never forget the exciting words that Comrade Andreyev said to us when we parted. He said: "Soviet-Chinese friendship is the greatest happiness of our two peoples and the greatest happiness of the people of the world. Therefore, we must maintain it!" Yes, we must always maintain it and never allow anyone to undermine it.

Our visit to the Soviet Union was mainly to participate in the Soviet people's festival celebrations, but we also had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union's communist construction. The great achievements of the Soviet Union in communist construction also left a good impression on us.

Through visits, we saw that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the Soviet people have achieved brilliant victories in the first year of the magnificent Seven-Year Plan. In 1959, the total value of Soviet industrial production increased by more than 11% compared with 1958. The growth rate of industrial production greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan. In 1959, the Soviet Union's steel reached 59.9 million tons, oil reached 129.5 million tons, grain reached 7.6 billion poods, and seed cotton reached 4.7 million tons (the highest output in Soviet history). In 1960, the Soviet Union's communist construction is continuing to move forward rapidly.

During our stay in the Soviet Union, we also saw that various parts of the Soviet Union were building a large number of civilian houses, schools, cultural palaces, and various collective welfare facilities.

These facts prove that the production level of the Soviet Union and the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people are constantly growing. These are the concrete manifestations of the Soviet people's brilliant victories in communist construction.

We firmly believe that the magnificent Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed, but will definitely be greatly overfulfilled.

The Soviet people have consistently provided multi-faceted fraternal assistance to our country's socialist construction. At present, although the Soviet Union itself is facing huge communist construction tasks, it is still continuing to support our country.

Comrade Kozlov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, told us: "At present, in all the major factories in the Soviet Union, there is almost no factory that is not producing for socialist countries, especially for China." Sixty factories in twenty cities in the Soviet Union produce equipment for our country's Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

When we visited the Likhachev Automobile Plant, the director of the plant, Comrade Krylov, told us that their plant had invested all their knowledge and experience in the construction of our country's Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant. During the construction of the Changchun Automobile Plant, the Soviet Union provided us with the most advanced equipment. The Likhachev Automobile Plant trained a complete set of cadres for the Changchun Automobile Plant. Several hundred people, from the director to the employees of the Changchun Automobile Plant, had interned at the Likhachev Automobile Plant, and during the same period, two hundred comrades from the Likhachev Automobile Plant had helped with work at the Changchun Automobile Plant.

We will never forget the support and assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people to our country in the revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. Here, we would like to once again express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people!

Our delegation has ended its friendly visit to the Soviet Union. The time we spent directly with the Soviet people in the Soviet Union will become an unforgettable day in our lives. We thank the Soviet Party and government leaders for their care during the visit. We thank the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, and their branches and activists in various places. Their reception and arrangements for us were very thoughtful, and they have done a lot of effective work to strengthen and develop the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

We firmly believe that through the mutual visits of the two friendly delegations, the great friendship between our two peoples will be further consolidated.

Our people have always regarded consolidating the Sino-Soviet alliance and consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as our most sacred international obligation. As the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance enters its second decade, the Chinese people will make greater efforts to enhance the noble friendship between the two peoples, consolidate the great alliance between the two peoples, strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp, and achieve greater victories in the cause of striving for world peace and human progress!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    我们永远在一起
    中苏友好协会访苏代表团  团长　刘长胜  副团长　李烛尘
    我们中苏友好协会代表团，接受苏联的邀请，作为中国的工人、青年、妇女、工商界、科学家、作家、艺术家和记者的代表，到苏联参加了中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的庆祝活动。从2月9日到24日的半个月当中，我们接触了苏联党、政和人民团体各方面的领导同志，生活在广大的苏联人民中间，和他们一起欢度了伟大的节日，感到无限的光荣和兴奋。
    我们深深地体会到，中国和苏联两个由工人阶级掌握了政权的、以马克思列宁主义为指导的社会主义大国结成了同盟，这是二十世纪五十年代具有伟大历史意义的事件。我们两国人民团结在一起，这是无敌于天下的力量。十年来的事实证明，中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结，对于中苏两国的发展，对于保卫世界和平，对于促进人类进步事业，都已经发挥了极其巨大的作用。第二个十年已经开始，我们完全可以预期，这个条约对推动今后历史的发展，还将继续发挥极其巨大和深远的影响。
    为了纪念这个伟大的节日，我们两国同时展开了大规模的庆祝活动，并且互相派出了代表团。苏联派出了以叶留金同志为首的苏中友好协会代表团。他们到中国后，受到了我国人民的热烈欢迎。同样，我们中苏友好协会的代表团，也受到了苏联人民的热烈欢迎。
    在这半个月中，我们生活在充满着兄弟友谊的气氛中，就好像在自己的家里一样。我们受到苏联各方面非常友好、非常热情的接待。苏联党政领导人苏斯洛夫同志和科兹洛夫同志在克里姆林宫接见了我们。苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席埃赫费利德同志、莫斯科市苏维埃主席波布罗夫尼科夫同志、苏中友协理事会主席安德烈耶夫同志、苏联对外友好和文化协会联合会主席波波娃同志和副主席戈尔什科夫同志也都分别接见了我们。苏联的领导同志强调指出中苏两国之间的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的，我们应该维护和加强这种友谊。
    在莫斯科期间，我们全体团员参加了在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行的盛大庆祝大会，还分别参加了许多机关、团体、工厂和学校的庆祝会。在所有的庆祝会上，讲话人都叙述了中苏两国人民深远的友谊，讲到自从十月革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立以来两国人民的友好合作关系的巨大发展，指出中苏同盟是崭新的国际关系的典范。在莫斯科期间，我们还在友谊宫参加了和苏中友好协会积极分子的会见会，并且在革命博物馆和俄国革命的老战士们——卓著功勋的老布尔什维克举行了座谈会。
    我们代表团还访问了阳光灿烂的阿塞拜疆共和国和它的首都巴库。在访问期间，我们和那里的党政负责同志、工人、集体农庄庄员以及文化界的代表人物见了面。我们到巴库的时候，正赶上阿塞拜疆共产党召开第二十四次代表大会，党中央第一书记阿洪多夫同志和许多领导同志，在百忙中接见了我们。巴库的庆祝大会原订14日开，巴库人民为等我们参加大会，改在15日晚上举行。那是一个隆重的庆祝大会。在阿塞拜疆的四天当中，我们作了许多参观访问，除巴库以外，我们访问了松加伊特市和库巴区。每到一地，我们都和当地的苏联兄弟姊妹们举行了联欢会、座谈会，并且参加了他们的庆祝会。
    仅仅从我们接触到的这一部分活动情况来看，可以想像得到，苏联人民对于开展这个伟大节日的庆祝活动是很热烈的，范围是很广泛的。
    在这次访问中间，苏联人民所表现出的对中国人民的友谊和热爱，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    无论在莫斯科、巴库或者新建立的工业城市松加伊特，我们每天都要遇到许多老朋友或新朋友，每天都可以听见苏联朋友的许多令人感动的话。
    我们在莫斯科的利哈乔夫汽车厂参观时，所到之处工人同志都用热烈的掌声欢迎我们，大家互相问好。在那里，我们遇见了到中国工作过的工程师格拉斯柯夫同志，他用中文对我们说：“苏联人不懂中国话，中国人不懂苏联话，这没有关系，因为我们的心是一样的。”在莫斯科时期，我们在中国大使馆新址参加了刘晓大使所举行的庆祝酒会。我们的新的大使馆座落在列宁山地区，紧靠着有名的莫斯科大学，建筑宏伟，带有浓厚的中国民族色彩，是莫斯科最漂亮的外国大使馆。这栋用苏联劳动人民的双手兴建起来的位于友谊路上的大厦，是中苏两国人民伟大友谊的结晶。位于里海之滨的阿塞拜疆共和国，虽然和我国相距遥远，但我们之间的友谊关系却有着悠久的历史。在十二世纪的时候，阿塞拜疆的大诗人尼扎米在他的著名的作品中，就赞美过中国人民。现代的阿塞拜疆的著名诗人中间，几乎没有一位没有写过中国的事的。
    我们两国人民的战斗的、牢不可破的友谊，经常地受到苏联人民的歌颂。在松加伊特市的群众大会上，一位从中国回去的专家在讲话中强调指出，“苏联人民永远是和中国人民在一起的，无论在和平时期，还是在严酷的年代。”在松加伊特市的第一中学，孩子们集会欢迎我们，并给我们每一个人戴上了红领巾，一位教师在会上热情奔放地说，“十年来，我们两国的友谊，像大理石一样坚固，像太阳一样明亮。”
    我们不仅遇到了许多支援过我国社会主义建设的人们——苏联专家，也遇到了许多访问过中国（包括旅行者在内）的人们，他们不仅都热爱中国，而且都是新中国各种建设成就的积极宣传者。许多苏联同志向我们表示，他们把到过中国当作光荣。不少的同志向我们追忆了他们对新中国的难忘的印象，并讲述他们在回到苏联以后写文章做报告宣传我国建设成就的情况。节日期间，我们曾经好多次碰到苏联著名的芭蕾舞演员列别辛斯卡娅同志，她是中苏友谊的积极宣传者，她在各处所作的讲话，受到人们的热情欢迎。
    许多苏联朋友都委托我们代为问候毛主席。苏联人民演员、阿塞拜疆有名的歌唱家毕尤里·毕尤里（意为“夜莺”）同志在临别的时候嘱告我们：“请向中国人民伟大的儿子毛泽东转致我衷心的敬意。”苏联的小孩子也知道毛主席。在从莫斯科到巴库的飞机上，我们看到一个活泼健壮的三、四岁模样的小男孩，当时，这个孩子指着我们问道：“他们是谁？”他的父亲说：“是中国人。”孩子就高兴地叫道：“呵！是毛泽东的亲人！”
    我们带着中国人民的友谊去苏联，现在又满载着苏联人民的友谊回到祖国。我们永远不会忘记安德烈耶夫同志在临别的时候对我们所说的激动人心的话。他说：“苏中友好是我们两国人民最大的幸福，也是全世界人民最大的幸福，因此，我们要维护它！”是的，我们要永远维护它，而决不允许任何人破坏它。
    我们这次去苏联，主要是参加苏联人民的节日庆祝活动，但也有机会参观了苏联的共产主义建设。苏联在共产主义建设中所取得的伟大成就，同样给我们留下了良好的印象。
    通过参观访问，我们看到，苏联人民在苏联共产党和以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的党中央的领导下，在宏伟的七年计划的第一年中，已经取得了辉煌的胜利。1959年，苏联工业生产总值比1958年增加了11％以上，工业生产增长的速度，大大超过了七年计划规定的年平均增长速度。1959年，苏联的钢已达到五千九百九十万吨，石油已达到一亿二千九百五十万吨，粮食七十六亿普特，籽棉四百七十万吨（这是苏联历史上最高的产量）。1960年，苏联的共产主义建设正继续迅速地向前迈进。
    在苏联期间，我们还看到苏联各地在大量地兴建民用住宅、学校、文化宫和各种各样的集体福利设施。
    这些事实证明，苏联的生产水平和苏联人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平都在不断增长着。这些都是苏联人民在共产主义建设中取得辉煌胜利的具体表现。
    我们深信，宏伟的七年计划不仅能够完成，而且一定能够大大超额完成。
    苏联人民对于我国的社会主义建设一贯地给予了多方面的兄弟般的援助。目前，苏联本身虽然面临着巨大的共产主义建设任务，但它仍然在继续不断地支援我国。
    苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫同志告诉我们：“目前，在苏联的所有大工厂里，几乎没有一个工厂不在为社会主义国家进行生产，特别是为中国进行生产。”分布在苏联二十个城市里的六十个工厂，为我国洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂生产设备。
    我们去利哈乔夫汽车厂参观时，厂长克雷洛夫同志告诉我们，他们的厂把自己的全部知识和经验都投入了我国长春第一汽车制造厂的建筑上。在长春汽车厂的建设中间，苏联提供给我们的是最新式的设备。利哈乔夫汽车厂为长春汽车厂培养了整套的干部。长春汽车厂从厂长到职工有好几百人在利哈乔夫汽车厂实习过，而在同一期间，利哈乔夫汽车厂有两百位同志在长春汽车厂帮助过工作。
    我们永远不会忘记苏联政府和苏联人民在革命斗争中和社会主义建设中对于我国的支持和援助，在这里，我们要再一次地向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心地感谢！
    我们的代表团已经结束了在苏联的友好访问。我们在苏联直接和苏联人民相处的这一段时间，将要成为我们一生中难忘的日子。我们感谢苏联党政领导同志在访问期间对我们的关怀。我们感谢苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会、苏中友好协会以及它们在各地的分会和积极分子们，他们对于我们的接待和安排是十分周到的，他们对于加强和发展中苏两国人民之间的友谊作了很多卓有成效的工作。
    我们深信，通过两个友好代表团的互相访问，必将使我们两国人民的伟大友谊更加巩固。
    我国人民从来就把巩固中苏同盟、巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结作为自己最神圣的国际义务。在中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订进入第二个十年的时候，中国人民将做出更大的努力，来增进两国人民的崇高友谊，巩固两国人民的伟大同盟，加强社会主义阵营的伟大团结，使争取世界和平和人类进步的事业取得更大的胜利！
    中苏两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
