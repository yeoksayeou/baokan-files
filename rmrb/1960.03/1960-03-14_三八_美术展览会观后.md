Thoughts After Viewing the “March 8th” Art Exhibition
Wu Zuoren

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the “March 8th” International Working Women’s Day, the All-China Women's Federation and the Artists Association organized an art exhibition of works by women artists. This is the first time since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and also the first time in Chinese history. Since the Great Leap Forward, after the red and expert debates, studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching studies to criticize the bourgeois worldview, women art workers, like art workers across the country, have gone deep into life, engaged in labor training, and greatly improved their ideological awareness in the heat of struggle, and have also brought great enthusiasm to their creations. This exhibition is a very good proof of this. This is a brilliant victory of the Party and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies on the art front.

With the rapid development of China's national economy and the continuous improvement of people's needs for cultural life, the art cause has also achieved tremendous development. Thanks to the vigorous cultivation by the Party and the state, the continuous improvement of women art workers in ideology and artistic skills, and more importantly, the continuous emergence of new forces from the working people, the ranks of art creation have become even stronger. The broad masses of women art workers are wielding art, this revolutionary weapon, with unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm, to serve the motherland's production and construction. In their works, they reflect the struggles of the working people on various production fronts and the ever-changing socialist construction in the Great Leap Forward of the motherland, as well as the various new lifestyles of the working people. They also eulogize the heroic figures who dedicated themselves to the people's revolutionary cause, depict the magnificent landscape of the motherland, and beautify the costumes of various ethnic groups. Every stitch and thread, every flower and tree, all demonstrate the talents and achievements of Chinese women art workers. What makes us particularly excited in this exhibition is that, in addition to several octogenarians and other senior painters participating in the exhibition, a large number of new forces have emerged, many of whom have grown up during the Great Leap Forward. Although some of these new forces are still in their infancy, they are very strong. They will surely grow up quickly in the fertile soil of socialism.

The more than four hundred exhibits are rich in content and diverse in form, presenting a new atmosphere of a hundred flowers blooming. For example, "March 8th Iron Smelting Furnace," "Family Members Participating in Production," "Asking for Fish from the East Sea," "Sending Public Grain," "The First Spring," and "Revolutionary Mother Xu Dama" all vividly reflect the life and heroic model images of various aspects of China since the Great Leap Forward. The New Year picture "Chairman Mao Meets with Representatives of Women of All Ethnic Groups" embodies the people's seeing their most beloved leader, revealing an irrepressible enthusiasm. The color woodcut "Spring" shows the spring plowing of the commune, the color is very simple, but the contrast is brilliant. The propaganda posters by Yang Wenxiu, You Longgu, Wu Xingqing, and others in Shanghai encourage the working people's high enthusiasm for production and learning, and promote diligence and thrift in managing households. In addition, there are works that show women taking up social work positions, socializing housework, and contributing their strength to the masses and collectives, such as "Waitress," "Female Driver," and "Female Police Officer," etc.

In the exhibition, many excellent landscape and flower-and-bird paintings are also very popular among the audience. He Xiangning's "Red Plum," Sun Songzhao's "A Hundred Flowers Blooming," and Hu Jieqing's "East Wind Blowing Azaleas Open" are all Chinese paintings full of vitality and poetic mood.

Sculpture art, which was relatively weak in the past, also saw new works in today's exhibition, such as "Friendship," which expresses the profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and "African Women," which expresses the liberation struggle of the African people. Reliefs such as "Fisherman's Song," "Joy of Harvest," and wood carvings such as "Beside the Field," as well as colored pottery, porcelain sculptures, toy crafts, and pattern designs also have outstanding works.

The exhibition also showcased handicrafts sent from various regions, such as clothing, drawnwork, and embroidery designs, which are ingenious and colorful. What is even more gratifying is that we also see the art of the fraternal ethnic minorities in the Southwest, also presented in this rich and colorful exhibition with a unique and delightful style.

The women art workers of New China are a strong force on the front of socialist cultural construction in the motherland. They have also played their creative talents in the artistic decoration of many newly built public buildings. I cannot introduce this exhibition in more detail in this limited space. Of course, this exhibition is far from encompassing all the contributions of women art workers. But when we see this exhibition, we feel that this lineup will grow stronger and stronger day by day and its unlimited future. I wish Chinese women art workers will continue to improve ideologically and professionally in the future, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better serve the people, and become a strong force in building socialist and communist culture.

    “三八”美术展览会观后
    吴作人
    为了庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年，全国妇联和美术家协会组织了一个妇女美术家的作品展览会。这是建国以来的第一次，也是中国历史上的第一次。大跃进以来，经过红专辩论，学习八届八中全会的文件，反右倾、鼓干劲，开展批判资产阶级世界观的学习之后，妇女美术工作者和全国美术工作者一样，深入生活，劳动锻炼，在火热的斗争当中大大提高了自己的思想觉悟，在创作上也发挥了很大的干劲。这次的展出就是一个很好的证明。这是党和毛主席的文艺方针在美术战线上的辉煌胜利。
    随着我国国民经济的飞跃发展，人民对文化生活需要的不断提高，美术事业也获得了巨大的发展。由于党和国家的大力培养，妇女美术工作者在思想上和艺术技巧上的不断提高，更由于从劳动人民中不断出现新生力量，使美术创作的队伍更加壮大了。广大的妇女美术工作者正以无比的革命热情，掌握着美术这个革命的武器，为祖国的生产建设服务。在她们的作品里，反映了劳动人民在各个生产战线上的斗争和祖国大跃进中日新月异的社会主义建设，以及劳动人民种种新的生活面貌。她们还歌颂了为人民革命事业而献身的英雄人物，描绘了祖国壮丽的锦绣河山，美化了各族人民的衣装服饰。一针一线，一花一木，这些都表明了我国妇女美术工作者们的才智和取得的成就。在这次展览中特别使我们感到兴奋的，是参加展出的作者，除去几位年过八旬高龄和其他一些前辈的画家外，还涌现了一大批新生力量，其中有许多都是在大跃进期间成长起来的。这批新生力量，有的尽管还是萌芽状态，但是却很健壮。她们在社会主义肥沃的土壤上一定会很快地成长起来。
    展出的四百余件作品，内容丰富，形式多样，呈现出一片百花齐放的新气象。如“三八炼铁炉”、“家属参加生产”、“向东海要鱼”、“送公粮”、“第一个春天”、“革命的母亲徐大妈”等，都生动地反映了大跃进以来我国各方面的生活面貌和英雄模范的形象。年画“毛主席接见各族妇女代表”，体现出人民看到了最崇爱的领袖，流露着不可遏止的热情。套色木刻“春”表现了公社春耕的情况，色彩很单纯，但对比显得灿烂。上海杨文秀、游龙姑、吴性情等的宣传画，鼓舞劳动人民对生产和学习的高度积极性，宣传勤俭持家。此外，还有表现妇女走上社会工作的岗位，把家务事社会化，为群众集体贡献出自己的力量的作品，如“服务员”、“女司机”、“女民警”等等。
    展出中，许多优秀的山水、花鸟画，也很受观众的欢迎。如何香凝的“红梅”，孙诵昭的“百花齐放”和胡絜青的“东风阵阵杜鹃开”等都是生意充沛，富有诗境的国画。
    过去比较薄弱的雕塑艺术，今天在展览中也看到了新的作品，如表现中苏深厚友谊的“友谊”，表现非洲人民解放斗争的“非洲妇女”。浮雕“渔歌”、“丰收的喜悦”和木雕“田边”以及彩陶、瓷塑、玩具等工艺造型及图案设计也都有出色的作品。
    展览会还展出了各地区送来的工艺品，如服装、挑花，刺绣方面的设计，意匠精巧，色彩绚丽。更可喜的是我们还看到西南各兄弟民族的艺术，也在这丰富多彩的展览中呈现着独特的令人喜爱的风貌。
    新中国的妇女美术工作者，在祖国社会主义文化建设战线上是一支强大的力量，在许多新建的公共建筑的美术装修方面，也发挥了她们的创造性的才能。我不可能在这一有限的篇幅里更多地介绍这个展览会。当然，这个展览也远不能包括妇女美术工作者的全部贡献。但是当我们看了这个展览会就觉得这个阵容将日益成长壮大和它的无限前途。祝颂中国的妇女美术工作者今后不断地在思想上和业务上提高，高举毛泽东思想红旗，更好地为人民服务，成为建设社会主义和共产主义文化的坚强的力量。（附图片）
