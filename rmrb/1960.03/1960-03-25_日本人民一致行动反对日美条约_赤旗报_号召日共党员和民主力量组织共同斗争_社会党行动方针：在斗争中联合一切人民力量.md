Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 23rd—The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published an editorial today pointing out that the 13th National Unified Action to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has set off a new high tide of struggle since the signing of this U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The editorial said that this unified action concentrated the demands of all strata of the Japanese people, including workers, farmers, and citizens, and was carried out nationwide in the form of protests and petitions to the Diet and local governments. It also echoed the struggle of progressive political parties in the Diet and promoted contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party.

The editorial emphasized that, under the current circumstances, the struggle after the 14th National Unified Action will have even greater significance. The central objectives of future unified actions should be: organizing the working class to launch strike struggles, developing the struggles of farmers, citizens, and other strata of the people, launching Diet struggles that echo these movements, and combining these struggles to strive to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," force the dissolution of the Diet, and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

The editorial said that members of the Japanese Communist Party must unite with the working class, all democratic forces, and local joint struggle organizations, and strive to organize nationwide strikes and protest struggles.

The editorial also said that striving to complete the campaign to collect 10 million signatures against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the JCP's independently launched campaign to collect 3 million signatures to protest to the Nobusuke Kishi government and the U.S. government are of great significance. The signature campaign has received the support of the people, and door-to-door visits have yielded valuable political results.

The editorial suggested convening a general meeting of representatives of organizations that are members of the National Conference Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to discuss the current situation and tasks, and further strengthen the leadership of the National Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 23rd—The 17th Extraordinary National Convention of the Japan Socialist Party opened in Tokyo today. The 412 delegates attending the meeting will discuss and formulate the Socialist Party's political program.

Chairman of the Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, spoke at the meeting, emphasizing that all party members should unite and fight against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Suzuki pointed out that the Japanese situation is facing a serious situation. The characteristics of the current Japanese situation are: signing a military alliance treaty with the United States, implementing trade "liberalization," and enterprise "rationalization" that intensifies attacks on workers. This situation is very similar to the situation during World War II when Japan, Germany, and Italy signed the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Suzuki continued that, because Japan is succumbing to the United States, Socialist Party members should prepare for hard struggles in the future. He emphasized that the Japan Socialist Party should not commit right-leaning errors like most European socialist parties.

Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, gave a report on the party's work last year. He said that the Socialist Party has been fighting with high spirits for the complete independence of Japan and has combined various daily struggles with the struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Representatives of Japanese workers' and farmers' organizations spoke at the meeting, wishing the Socialist Party unity and resolutely opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th—The action plan for the recent period adopted by the Japan Socialist Party's Extraordinary National Convention on the evening of the 23rd stated that the Socialist Party will strive to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and safeguard the people's lives and rights.

The action plan stated that winning the victory in the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" is the best way to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations and improve Japan-Soviet relations. In this struggle, the Japanese people will unite with the world's democratic forces striving for peaceful coexistence, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

The action plan emphasized that in the struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it is necessary to unite with the forces of all the people, regardless of their political and ideological differences. The action plan said, "If this is done, it will be possible to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new 'Security Treaty' and place the Nobusuke Kishi government in an extremely passive position."

The action plan mentioned that the Socialist Party should launch a resolute struggle against divisive activities in the trade union movement.

The action plan emphasized that the Socialist Party should eliminate factionalism within the party and promote party unity.

The conference also adopted a movement plan, emphasizing the need to fight against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," against atomic and hydrogen bombs, to promote the normalization of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet relations, to abolish U.S. military bases in Japan, and to demand that the United States return Okinawa to Japan.

Today's conference also decided on the Socialist Party's election strategy for the next general election. This strategy stated that it is necessary to strive to obtain more seats in the Diet, prevent the amendment of the Constitution, and oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    日本人民一致行动反对日美条约
    “赤旗报”号召日共党员和民主力量组织共同斗争
    社会党行动方针：在斗争中联合一切人民力量
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论指出，阻止批准新日美“安全条约”第十三次全国统一行动掀起了自从签订这项日美军事同盟条约以来新的斗争高潮。
    社论说，这次统一行动集中了日本工人、农民、市民等各阶层人民的要求，用向国会和地方政府提出抗议和请愿的形式在全国范围内展开，并且同国会内进步政党的斗争相呼应，促进了自由民主党内部的矛盾。
    社论强调指出，在目前情况下第十四次全国统一行动以后的斗争将具有更加重大的意义。今后统一行动的中心目标应该是：组织工人阶级展开罢工斗争，发展农民、市民等各阶层人民的斗争，展开同这些运动相呼应的国会斗争，并且把这些斗争结合起来，以争取阻止批准新“安全条约”，迫使解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁。
    社论说，日本共产党党员必须同工人阶级和一切民主力量以及地方共同斗争组织在一起，努力组织全国性罢工和抗议斗争。
    社论又说，争取完成征集一千万人签名反对新日美“安全条约”的运动和日共单独展开的征集三百万人签名向岸信介政府和美国政府抗议的运动具有重大意义。签名运动得到了人民的支持，挨户访问收到了可贵的政治效果。
    社论建议召开阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议成员团体的全体代表大会，以便讨论当前的形势和任务，进一步加强国民会议的领导力量。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党第十七次临时代表大会今天在东京开幕，出席会议的四百一十二名代表将讨论和制定社会党的政治纲领。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在会议上讲话，强调全体党员应当团结一致为反对批准新日美“安全条约”而斗争。
    铃木指出，日本形势面临着严重局面。当前日本局势的特点是：同美国签订了军事同盟条约，实行贸易“自由化”和对工人加紧进攻的企业“合理化”。这种形势和第二次世界大战中，日、德、意三国签订反共同盟条约的局势十分相似。
    铃木接着说，由于日本屈从美国，日本社会党党员应当为将来参加艰苦的斗争作好准备。他强调，日本社会党不应像大多数欧洲社会党那样，犯右倾错误。
    社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎作了关于去年党的工作报告。他说，社会党一直在精神饱满地为争取日本的完全独立而斗争，并且把各项日常斗争同反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争结合起来进行。
    日本工人和农民团体的代表在会议上讲话，祝社会党团结起来，坚决反对新日美“安全条约”。
    据新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党临时代表大会23日晚上通过的最近时期行动方针表示，社会党要为废除日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交、维护人民生活和权利而奋斗。
    行动方针说，取得阻止批准新“安全条约”斗争的胜利，是打开日中关系僵局和改善日苏关系的最好办法。在这场斗争中，日本人民将要同争取和平共处、禁止核武器和争取全面彻底裁军的世界民主力量进行联合斗争。
    行动方针强调说，在反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争中，必须同一切人民的力量联合起来，而不问其在政治上和思想意识上的不同。行动方针说，“如果做到这一点，就有可能阻止国会批准新‘安全条约’和使岸信介政府处于极端被动的地位。”
    行动方针提到社会党要对工会运动中的分裂活动展开坚决斗争。
    行动方针强调社会党要消除党内宗派主义，促进党的团结。
    大会还通过运动方针，强调必须进行斗争，反对批准新“安全条约”，反对原子弹和氢弹，促进日中、日苏关系正常化，取消美国在日本的军事基地、要求美国把冲绳归还给日本。
    今天的大会还决定了社会党在下届大选时的选举对策。这项对策表示要争取在国会获得更多的议席，阻止修改宪法，反对新日美“安全条约”。
