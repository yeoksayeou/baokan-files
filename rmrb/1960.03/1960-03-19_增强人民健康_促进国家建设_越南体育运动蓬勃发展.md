    Strengthening People's Health and Promoting National Construction
    Vigorous Development of Sports in Vietnam
    Under the care of the Labor Party and the government, sports in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are developing rapidly and extensively.
    In 1959, nearly two million people (excluding the military) in cities alone participated in sports activities. The number of athletes increased to more than 186,000, an increase of more than 67% compared to the previous year. At present, there are a total of 3,469 football teams and 8,166 volleyball teams in the country.
    People doing exercises to the music broadcast by radio stations have become increasingly widespread. Office cadres do fifteen minutes of exercises every day. Many agricultural production cooperative members do fifteen minutes of physical exercise before engaging in agricultural labor. Young members also like to play football and volleyball in the afternoon. In winter, young farmers in many areas still practice swimming as usual.
    On the basis of the extensive development of mass sports activities, the level of sports has also been continuously improved. 1959 was a fruitful year for creating new records. Now, almost all of the track and field records in North Vietnam have surpassed those in South Vietnam. Swimming records have also greatly exceeded those in South Vietnam.
    In order to strengthen the state's leadership over sports, further enhance people's health, and promote the socialist construction of North Vietnam, the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided to reorganize the Central Sports Committee into the Central Sports Bureau. Lieutenant General Hoang Van Thai of the People's Army will serve as the chairman. (Xinhua News Agency)

    增强人民健康　促进国家建设
    越南体育运动蓬勃发展
    越南民主共和国的体育运动在劳动党和政府的关怀下，正以迅速的步伐，越来越广泛地开展着。
    1959年，仅仅在城市里就有近两百万人（不包括军队）参加了体育运动。运动员的人数增加到十八万六千多人，比前一年增加了67％强。目前全国一共有足球队三千四百六十九个，排球队八千一百六十六个。
    随着广播电台播送的音乐进行体操的人们已经越来越广泛。机关干部每天要作一刻钟的体操。许许多多农业生产合作社的社员在从事农业劳动之前都要作十五分钟体育锻炼。年轻的社员还喜欢在下午踢足球和打排球。在冬天，许多地区的青年农民仍然照常地练习游泳。
    在群众体育活动广泛开展的基础上，体育运动的水平也不断有了提高。1959年在创造新的纪录方面是丰收的一年。现在越南北方的田径运动纪录已经几乎全部超过了越南南方的纪录。游泳方面的纪录也大大超过了越南南方的纪录。
    为了加强国家对体育运动的领导，进一步增进人民的健康，促进越南北方的社会主义建设，越南民主共和国部长会议已经决定改组中央体育委员会为中央体育局。由人民军中将黄文泰担任主席。　（新华社）
