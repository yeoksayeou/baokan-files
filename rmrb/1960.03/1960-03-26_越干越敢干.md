    The news from the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant can give people a lot of inspiration. After reading this news, we can first draw such a conclusion: modern large enterprises also need to innovate technology, can also innovate technology, and can achieve huge results.
    However, in the past, even within the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, there were many people who could not accept this conclusion. They believed: "Our technical equipment is modern, and there is nothing to negate." "Modern large factories cannot be changed," "If you want to change, you can only make small changes, not big changes." What is the opinion of the workers in the whole factory now? They are not satisfied with small changes, they demand big changes, and they want to continue to reform. "Yu Gong moved mountains too slowly, we should learn from Erlang to carry the mountains on our shoulders." "In the past, we worked squatting, now we work standing, and in the future, we will work sitting down."... What a different spirit, what a different boldness!
    How did this major change come about? The most important reason is that the leading cadres of this factory resolutely implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, armed the masses with the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, and the idea of continuous revolution as instructed by the Party, constantly put forward new topics, and actively mobilized the broad masses of workers to carry out the struggle of continuous technological innovation. The technological innovation and technological revolution movement in this factory, from solving key production problems sporadically, to improving operation methods and process equipment in a more comprehensive way, especially after the trial production of "Dongfeng" brand sedans and "Hongqi" brand high-end sedans, the workers' experience became richer and richer, and they discovered more and more potential in production, so their courage became bolder and bolder, and their spirit became greater and greater. On this basis, the whole factory launched a high-standard "one new, three modernizations" movement—adopting new technologies and marching towards a high degree of mechanization, automation, and rationalization of production organization. As the workers said: "The more you think, the more you dare to do; the more you do, the more you dare to think; the more you think, the higher you dare to think; the more you do, the bigger you dare to do."
    This is the dialectic of real life. Some people, in the beginning, think that modern enterprises have nothing to innovate, and they dare not change modern equipment, or they think that their factory's technical conditions are poor, and they dare not engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization. This is not surprising. This mainly reflects their lack of systematic understanding of the content, methods, and so on of technological innovation. In the past, many people had never done technological innovation, and as for workers and general technicians reforming modern equipment, many people had never even thought about it, so naturally they would feel no confidence and no certainty. How to change this situation? It is necessary to practice and pay attention to summarizing experience in practice in a timely manner. First liberate the mind, break superstitions, and boldly do it; in the process of doing it, after having perceptual knowledge, further improve to rational knowledge, and grasp the objective laws, naturally you will be bold and confident, and dare to think higher and dare to do more difficult things.
    Liberate the mind, innovate technology, further liberate the mind, and push technological innovation to a further level—our technological innovation and technological revolution movement is leaping forward in this process of constantly improving understanding and constantly practicing.

    越干越敢干
    楚雪
    长春第一汽车制造厂的新闻可以给人们许多启发。读完这条新闻，首先可以得出这样一个结论：现代化大企业同样需要革新技术，也能够革新技术，而且可以取得巨大的成果。
    但是，这一结论，在过去，就在长春第一汽车厂内，也是有许多人不能接受的。他们认为：“我们的技术装备是现代化的，没有什么要否定的。”“现代化大厂不能改动”，“要改也只能小改不能大改”。现在全厂职工的舆论怎样呢？他们不满足于小改，要求大改，而且要不断改革。“愚公移山嫌太慢，要学二郎把山担。”“过去蹲着干，现在站着干，将来要坐着干。”……这是何等不同的劲头，这是何等不同的气魄！
    这一重大转变是怎样来的？最重要的原因，就在于这个厂的领导干部坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，用党所指示的敢想敢说敢干的精神和不断革命的思想武装了群众，不断地提出新课题，积极发动广大职工进行了不断革新技术的斗争。这个厂的技术革新和技术革命运动，从零星解决生产关键问题，到比较全面地改进操作方法，改进工艺装备，特别是经过“东风”牌轿车和“红旗”牌高级轿车的试制，职工们的经验越来越丰富，越来越多地发现了生产中的潜力，胆量就越来越壮，气魄就越来越大。在这一基础上，全厂开展了高标准的“一新三化”运动——采用新技术，向高度机械化、自动化、生产组织合理化大进军。这正如工人们所说的：“越想越敢干，越干越敢想；越想越敢想，越干越敢干；越想越高，越干越大。”
    这是实际生活的辩证法。有些人在开始的时候，认为现代化企业没有什么要革新的，对现代化设备不敢改动，或者是认为自己厂子技术条件差，不敢搞机械化、半机械化。这都不奇怪。这主要是反映了他们对技术革新的内容、方法等等还缺乏规律性的了解。过去许多人都没有干过革新技术这桩事，至于由工人和一般技术人员来改革现代化设备，许多人更是连想都没有想过，自然会感到没有信心，没有把握。怎样改变这种状况？就是要实践，并且注意在实践中及时总结经验。首先解放思想，破除迷信，大胆地去干；在干的过程中，有了感性认识，进一步再提高到理性认识，掌握了客观规律，自然就胆大气壮，信心充沛，并且敢于想得更高，敢于去干更困难的事情。
    解放思想，革新技术，进一步解放思想，把技术革新又推进一步——我们的技术革新和技术革命运动，就是在这样不断提高认识，不断实践的过程中飞跃发展的。
