Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 5th: News from Tokyo: Non-mainstream Diet members of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, at a meeting of the party's "Security Treaty" sub-committee on the 4th, expressed their disagreement with the Kishi Nobusuke group's "unified interpretation" of the "Far East" region to which the "Security Treaty" applies, and demanded that Chinese territory be removed from the applicable area of the new "Security Treaty."

The Kishi Nobusuke group originally intended to use this meeting to get the non-mainstream factions to agree to its aggressive "unified interpretation" of the "Far East" range, namely that the "Far East" range stipulated in the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is north of the Philippines and Japan and its surrounding areas, including Chinese territories of Taiwan, Jinmen (Quemoy), and Mazu (Matsu), South Korean territory of South Korea, and parts of Soviet territory. However, the "Security Treaty" sub-committee meeting on the 4th failed to reach a consensus.

Reports say that Koizumi Kiyoshi, representative of the Matsumura-Miki faction, pointed out at the meeting that including a part of Chinese territory in the "Far East" applicable range will further worsen Japan-China relations and will put Japan at risk of being dragged into war.

It is reported that Ishibashi faction Diet member Utsunomiya Tokuma expressed support for Koizumi's view, and pointed out that at this current time, Japan does not need to conclude a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." According to today's "Asahi Shimbun," the ruling faction of the Liberal Democratic Party is planning to isolate the Ishibashi faction among the non-mainstream factions, in order to reduce the resistance from within the party on the issue of ratifying the new "Security Treaty."

Recently, non-mainstream members centered on the Ishibashi faction and the Matsumura-Miki faction have expressed dissent to the new "Security Treaty" and dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government's current policies towards China and the Soviet Union. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Kawashima Shojiro and other leaders of the ruling faction are concerned that this trend will expand into an obstacle to the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of its foreign policy, and may become the beginning of the formation of a united front against Kishi Nobusuke within the party.

The newspaper revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke group is preparing to convene a meeting of leaders of various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party to "adjust" opinions within the party, especially to "persuade" the Kono faction.

However, the "Asahi Shimbun" believes that Matsumura Kenzo does not attach importance to this kind of meeting, and Ikeda Hayato also expresses doubt about the role of this kind of meeting. Therefore, it is feared that the Liberal Democratic Party will need some time to "adjust" internal differences of opinion.

    日本执政党内部矛盾在发展
    非当权派不满当权派敌视中苏的外交政策
    当权派负责人担心反岸派会结成联合战线
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党内非当权派议员在4日举行的党内“安全条约”小组委员会会议上，表示不同意岸信介集团关于“安全条约”适用范围“远东”地区的“统一解释”，要求从新“安全条约”适用地区中除掉中国领土。
    岸信介集团原想通过这次会议使非当权派同意它关于“远东”范围的侵略性的“统一解释”，即新日美“安全条约”中所规定的“远东”范围是菲律宾以北和日本及其周围地区，包括中国领土台湾、金门、马祖、朝鲜领土南朝鲜以及苏联部分领土。但是，4日的“安全条约”小组委员会会议没有取得一致意见。
    消息说，松村—三木派的代表古井喜实在会上指出，把中国领土的一部分划入“远东”适用范围，将使日中关系更加恶化，并且将使日本有被卷入战争的危险。
    据报道，石桥派的国会议员宇都宫德马表示支持古井的见解，并且指出，在目前这个时期，日本没有缔结新日美“安全条约”的必要。据“朝日新闻”今天透露，自由民主党的当权派正在策划孤立非当权派中的石桥派，以便减少在批准新“安全条约”问题上来自党内的阻力。
    最近，以石桥派和松村—三木派为中心的非当权派成员纷纷对新“安全条约”表示有异议，并且表示不满意岸信介政府现行的对中苏两国的政策。“朝日新闻”说，自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎等当权派的负责人正在担心这种动向会扩大成为岸信介政府执行它的外交政策上的障碍，并且有可能成为在党内结成反对岸信介的联合战线的开端。
    这家报纸透露，岸信介集团准备召开一次自由民主党内各派负责人的会议，来“调整”党内的意见。特别是要“说服”河野派。
    但是“朝日新闻”认为，松村谦三不重视这种会议，池田勇人也对这种会议的作用表示怀疑，因此自由民主党想“调整”内部的意见分歧，恐怕还需要一段时间。
