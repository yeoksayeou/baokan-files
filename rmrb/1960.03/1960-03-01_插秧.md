Spring Ploughing Ballad

   Rice Planting
   Liu Zhang, Banbishan Commune, Xinglong, Hebei

   White water,
   Verdant mountains,
   A sea of flowers rolling to meet the blue sky.
   Cattle roar in the clouds,
   Machines circle the mountains,
   Rice seedlings roll in layers like waves...
   The secretary plants rice in the fields,
   Wiping endless sweat from his brow.
   The hands of the villagers,
   Are more wonderful than living gods,
   Golden and silver threads, steel needles,
   Sew a beautiful spring in the mountain area!
   The girls laugh merrily,
   As everyone composes mountain songs:
  “Steel needles, golden and silver threads,
   A good spring will forever reside in the mountain area,
   Thousands of threads, all from one source,
   The Party has given us the general line!”

   插秧
   河北兴隆半壁山公社　刘章
   白花花的水，
   青葱葱的山，
   花海滚滚接蓝天。
   牛在云里吼，
   机器绕山转，
   稻秧层层浪花翻……
   书记插秧在田间，
   擦不尽头上的汗。
   乡亲们的手，
   妙过活神仙，
   金银线，钢铁针，
   缝的山区好春天！
   姑娘们笑哈哈，
   大伙把山歌编：
  “钢铁针，金银线，
   山区永住好春天，
   千线万线一根头，
   党交给咱们总路线！”
