    Chain-Type Lumber Loading Machine
    Yi Xinghua, a loading worker at the Kuduer Forestry Bureau in the Greater Khingan Range forest area, recently successfully created a chain-type lumber loading machine. This loading machine is more than five times as efficient as manual loading and can greatly reduce the labor intensity of loading workers.
    This machine uses a motor (or internal combustion engine) to drive six iron chains with hooks through a gearbox, which can continuously load logs onto the vehicle one by one. It is simple in structure and easy to manufacture. Except for some iron materials, most of the materials are wood.

    链式木材装车机
    大兴安岭林区库都尔林业局装车工人易兴华，最近创造成功一台链式木材装车机。这种装车机比人工装车效率高五倍以上，可以大大减轻装车工人的劳动强度。
    这台机器用一个电动机（或内燃机）通过一个变速箱，带动六个带钩的铁链条，能把一根根木材连续装到车上。它的结构简单，制造容易，除一部分铁料以外，大部分材料是木材。
