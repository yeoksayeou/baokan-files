Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th: The Indian Conference for Peace and Disarmament opened here on the afternoon of the 27th. This three-day conference was convened by Indian parliamentarians.

More than five hundred delegates attended the conference, including members of the Indian Parliament and members of state legislative assemblies. The Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Algeria, Lebanon, and Italy sent observers to the conference.

The conference chairman, Dewan Chaman Lal, emphasized the importance of disarmament for safeguarding world peace in his address. He said, "There should be no further delay in making a decision on the issue of disarmament."

Chaman Lal praised Khrushchev's proposal for complete disarmament and the Soviet government's unilateral reduction of armed forces.

He also spoke of the need to eliminate all causes of disputes, conflicts, and dissatisfaction, saying, "One of the important causes of such conflicts is the denial of freedom to Asian and African countries." He strongly condemned the South African massacre and said, "No force in the world can stop the African people from marching towards freedom."

Speaking of India's policy of non-alignment, Chaman Lal said, "We intend to resolve all our difficulties and disputes with other countries through friendly negotiations," "Obviously, we cannot talk about peace in the world while at the same time failing to apply the same principles to our relations with the world."

Mirza Ibrahimov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a letter from the Soviet Peace Committee to the conference. He said that the Soviet people are willing to join hands with the people of other countries to strive for universal, complete, and supervised disarmament.

Burhan, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee and representative of the National People's Congress, said at the meeting that the Chinese people are consistently committed to the cause of world peace. The Chinese government has repeatedly and voluntarily reduced its armed forces. The Chinese people will continue to work together with all peace-loving people around the world to strive for universal disarmament and defend world peace.

Burhan pointed out that currently, the forces of war are making some peaceful gestures, but many of their actions violate the desire of the people of the world for peace. All those who are sincerely committed to peace must maintain due vigilance and continue to work to thwart the conspiracies of the enemies of peace.

Burhan said that the unremitting struggle of Asian and African countries to win and defend national independence "has become an increasingly important factor in defending peace." He said, "In order to make a greater contribution to the cause of world peace, we Asian and African countries must rely on our own strength, strive to develop our national economies, further promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, promote Asian-African solidarity, and strengthen the friendly cooperation and mutual support of Asian and African countries in their common struggle."

Burhan concluded by saying, "May the friendship between China and India, which has a tradition of thousands of years, continue to be consolidated and developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Josef Boruvka, a member of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, spoke at the meeting about the feelings of the Czechoslovak people, who had experienced the horrors of two world wars, and assured them of their determination to fight for peace.

Albert Norden, a member of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, said that the people of the German Democratic Republic are paying close attention to the struggle of the Asian and African people for freedom and against colonialism.

Laszlo Dezséri, a member of the Hungarian National Assembly, said that the Soviet disarmament proposals had attracted the attention of people all over the world.

Cherif Guellal of Algeria, in his speech, condemned the atrocities of the NATO allies who oppress the Algerian and African people.

Klaivis Maksoud of Lebanon pointed out that national liberation is as important as disarmament, and for Asian and African countries, peace must mean national liberation and an end to exploitation.

Lucio Luzzatto, a member of the Italian Parliament, congratulated the conference on behalf of the World Peace Council and said that the Five Principles and the Bandung Principles greatly contribute to the struggle for peace. He said that the peace movement of the Asian and African people is a huge struggle for national independence and against colonialism.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the atrocities of the government of the Union of South Africa in massacring Africans.

    包尔汉说亚非民族独立斗争是保卫和平的重要因素
    新华社新德里27日电　印度争取和平和裁军会议27日下午在这里开幕。由印度议员召集的这次会议将举行三天。
    出席这次会议的有五百多位代表，其中包括印度国会议员和邦立法会议议员等。苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、阿尔及利亚、黎巴嫩和意大利等国都派遣了观察员出席这次会议。
    会议主席德旺·查曼拉尔在致词时强调指出裁军对保卫世界和平的重要性。他说：“不应再延阻作出关于裁军问题的决定。”
    查曼拉尔称赞赫鲁晓夫的全面裁军建议和苏联政府单方面裁减武装部队的行动。
    他还谈到应当消除争端、冲突和不满的一切原因，他说，“这种冲突的重要原因之一是，不给予亚非国家以自由”。他强烈谴责南非屠杀事件，并且说：“世界上没有一种力量能够制止非洲人民走向自由”。
    查曼拉尔谈到印度的不结盟政策时说，“我们打算通过友好谈判来解决我们同其他国家的一切困难和争端”，“显然，我们不能在世界上高谈和平，而同时却不用同样的原则来处理我们同世界的关系。”
    苏联最高苏维埃代表米尔扎·伊布拉吉莫夫递交了苏联保卫和平委员会给会议的信件。他说，苏联人民愿意同其他各国人民携起手来，为争取普遍、彻底和有监督的裁军而奋斗。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席、全国人民代表大会代表包尔汉在会上说，中国人民始终不渝地致力于世界和平事业。中国政府一再主动地裁减它的武装部队。中国人民将同全世界一切爱好和平的人民一起继续共同努力，争取普遍裁军，保卫世界和平。
    包尔汉指出，目前，战争力量作出了一些和平姿态，但是他们的许多行动却违反全世界人民争取和平的愿望。一切真诚致力于和平的人，必须保持应有的警惕，继续努力来挫败和平的敌人的阴谋活动。
    包尔汉说，亚非国家争取和保卫民族独立的不懈斗争“已经成为保卫和平的愈来愈重要的因素。”他说，“为了对世界和平事业作出更大的贡献，我们亚非国家必须依靠我们自己的力量，努力发展我们的国民经济，进一步发扬和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，促进亚非团结，加强亚非国家在共同斗争中的友好合作和互相支援。”
    包尔汉最后说，“愿有了几千年传统的中印友谊在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续巩固和发展。”
    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会议员约瑟夫·博鲁夫卡在会上谈到经历了两次世界大战恐怖的捷克斯洛伐克人民的感受，并且保证他们决心为和平而斗争。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院议员阿伯特·诺登说，德意志民主共和国人民密切注意亚非人民争取自由和反对殖民主义的斗争。
    匈牙利国民议会议员拉斯洛·德日利说，苏联的裁军建议引起了全世界人民的注意。
    阿尔及利亚的谢里夫·格拉勒在讲话时，谴责压迫阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民的北大西洋公约组织盟国的暴行。
    黎巴嫩的克劳维斯·马克苏德指出，民族解放同裁军一样重要，对于亚非国家来说，和平必须意味着民族解放和结束剥削。
    意大利议会议员卢契奥·卢查托代表世界和平理事会向会议表示祝贺，并且说，五项原则和万隆原则大大有助于争取和平的斗争。他说，亚非人民的和平运动是争取民族独立和反对殖民主义的巨大斗争。
    会议一致通过了关于谴责南非联邦政府屠杀非洲人的暴行的决议。
