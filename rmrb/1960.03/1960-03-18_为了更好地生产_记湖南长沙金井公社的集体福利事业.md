    For Better Production
    ——A Record of the Collective Welfare Undertakings of the Jinjing Commune in Changsha, Hunan
    Gong Jie, Mai Nong (pen name)
    Early in the morning, the service staff of the public dining hall of the Jinjing People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, are busy preparing breakfast for the commune members. The tables and benches are neatly arranged, and the dishes on the tables are covered with gauze, emitting an enticing aroma. The nursery and kindergarten staff are busy cleaning the rooms and the courtyard, preparing to welcome their lovely little charges.
    Mealtime is the liveliest time in the dining hall. Children and grandchildren rush to serve rice and water to their elderly elders, while parents attentively care for their children's meals. Young people always seize the opportunity of the first large gathering of the day to challenge their rivals, proposing new goals for the day's labor competition. Readers and propagandists are also keen to use this time when everyone is together to carry out propaganda activities.
    After breakfast, the commune members send their children to the nursery or kindergarten and begin their day of intense and enthusiastic labor life happily and without worries.
    How did the collective welfare undertakings of the Jinjing People's Commune come about?
    The Inevitable Product of Historical Development
    Historically, poor peasants had the habit of caring for and helping each other. After the agricultural producers' cooperatives were established, in order to adapt to the needs of collective production, "mutual assistance in household chores" became quite popular in the Jinjing area, and the deep friendship between the working people also developed.
    In 1958, under the glorious light of the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," a new situation of the Great Leap Forward emerged in the Jinjing area, as it did throughout the country. The scale of collective production expanded unprecedentedly, and the scattered individual life became increasingly incompatible with the objective situation. When the "Double Rush" (rushing to harvest early rice and rush to plant late rice) season arrived that year, there were many farm tasks and little time, and the masses generally felt that many problems could not be solved by eating separately. Every household had to get up in the middle of the night to cook "Ban He Rice" (a type of rice dish), so they could not get adequate rest; women were tied down by their children and could not participate in the "Double Rush"; men also had to help their families fetch water, chop firewood, and buy rice, oil, and salt, which also affected agricultural production. In order to solve this contradiction, many commune members advocated: collective eating and collective childcare. Farm-busy season dining halls and farm-busy season nurseries arose in response to the times and immediately produced huge effects. For example, the original Jinlian Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, because it set up farm-busy season dining halls and farm-busy season nurseries, had more than doubled the number of women participating in agricultural production compared to before, and the whole cooperative completed the "Double Rush" task ahead of schedule. Yu Shuchun, a female commune member who rarely went to work because she was burdened by her children, did 370 work points in one month of the "Double Rush," almost the same as a strong man. The "mutual assistance in household chores," farm-busy season dining halls and farm-busy season nurseries created by the masses in practice reflected the inevitable trend of the development of collective production and the requirement that household labor be gradually socialized.
    In October 1958, the Jinjing People's Commune was established. The double leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially the unprecedented bumper harvest of grain that year, created good material conditions for the commune to run various public welfare undertakings. That year, the total grain output of the Jinjing Commune reached more than 42 million catties, an increase of 46% compared to 1957, averaging 913 catties per person. The commune announced the implementation of the grain supply system, and the masses said happily that they now had an "unbreakable golden rice bowl."
    Popular Support Makes It Better and Better
    Public dining halls and nurseries, these new things that meet the requirements of history, received the enthusiastic support of the local Party committee and the warm support of the broad masses as soon as they appeared in the Jinjing area.
    When the Jinlian Agricultural Cooperative began to run "farm-busy season dining halls" and "farm-busy season nurseries," Luo Shuping, the secretary of the Jinxi Township Party Committee, came to the Jinlian Agricultural Cooperative to help try out and summarize experience. After the commune was established, after a large number of dining halls and nurseries were established, the commune Party committee paid more attention to leading these welfare undertakings. The commune, the brigade, and the work team all had special personnel in charge of welfare undertakings. The commune Party committee and the brigade Party general branch all had key dining halls and nurseries as "experimental" objects. Brigade cadres ate, lived, and worked with the masses in these dining halls, and promptly discovered and solved problems in the production and life of the masses. When some dining halls were first established, vegetables were not very abundant, so the commune Party committee bought a large number of vegetable seeds from the suburbs of Changsha and hired two vegetable-growing technicians to establish vegetable-growing experimental farms for the dining halls, cultivate vegetable-growing experts, and spread vegetable-growing experience. The Minsha Brigade ran a kindergarten, and the Party committee saw that the house was too small and the light was not sufficient, so they gave them the entire set of houses of the former tax office. The various production brigades also tried their best to take care of the supply of non-staple food to the kindergartens. Later, when rectifying and consolidating these welfare undertakings, the commune Party committee, based on the characteristics of scattered living in semi-mountainous and semi-hilly areas, appropriately reduced the size of the dining halls, achieving a three-in-one combination of work team, dining hall, and nursery, which further integrated production and life, and made leadership more convenient. Now, the vast majority of dining halls have established a set of democratic management and thrifty living systems.
    Now, the public welfare undertakings of the Jinjing Commune are getting better and better. The vast majority of dining halls have achieved "eating enough, eating well, and being hygienic"; the vast majority of children in nurseries are well taken care of. The masses personally experienced the superiority of the collective welfare undertakings run by the people's communes, and therefore developed infinite love for them, and used practical actions to safeguard collective interests. Zou Yide, a female commune member of the Huinong Brigade, saw that the dining hall lacked a kettle for boiling water, and fearing that the commune members would lack boiling water to drink, she dedicated her most precious wedding gift from her grandmother—a copper kettle—to the dining hall. This copper kettle, which had been preserved for more than twenty years, was something that women were reluctant to take out without a major happy event. Now, the people's commune has been established, and the collective welfare undertakings are well run, making this forty-one-year-old woman younger. She voluntarily participated in the cooking work, and single-handedly shouldered the glorious task of cooking for more than thirty people. She regarded the public dining hall as her own home, and carefully managed the dining hall with her experience in managing a household frugally, never wasting a single piece of firewood or a single vegetable leaf. She always considered the needs of everyone, and in the summer when vegetables were abundant, she pickled and dried many pickled vegetables and dried vegetables for the winter. She also paid great attention to the dietary preferences of the commune members, and tried her best to ensure that commune members with special habits could eat enough and eat well; she knew that some children did not like to eat chili peppers, so she always served the children vegetables before adding chili peppers; some elderly people liked to eat softer rice, so she tried to make it softer. She never let everyone eat cold rice. This spirit of communism of caring for the masses is precisely what has grown up from the new collective life. This is an ordinary rural woman, and what she has done shows that the public dining hall has taken root in the countryside.
    More Manpower
    Collective welfare undertakings such as public dining halls and nurseries not only liberated women's labor force and expanded the ranks of the agricultural labor army, but also greatly saved the time spent by poor peasants and single peasants in raising money to buy rice. Before the commune was established, some households with large populations, small labor forces, and weak family backgrounds, who also ate "revolving grain," had to spend about twenty workdays per household per year (as few as seven or eight, as many as thirty or forty) to raise money to buy rice. After the commune implemented the grain supply system and set up public dining halls, they no longer had to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt. In addition, the establishment of welfare undertakings also rationally utilized the auxiliary labor force in the countryside. According to a survey of five dining halls, the clerks, cooks, nursery staff, feeders, and people who chop firewood and grow vegetables in the dining halls and nurseries totaled 35 people, including 13 male semi-labor forces, 7 female full-labor forces, 8 female semi-labor forces, and 7 auxiliary labor forces. Among these people, only 12 were women under the age of 50. The remaining 23 were all over the age of 50, and they all undertook the work they could do.
    Because the establishment of public dining halls and nurseries liberated and excavated a large number of labor forces, the commune was able to arrange more manpower to vigorously develop industry, agriculture, and carry out diversified operations. After the establishment of the Jinjing Commune, in addition to successfully completing the tasks of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking and the autumn harvest and planting in 1958, it also transferred more than 2,400 young and middle-aged people to build the double-track Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, which lasted for more than three months; it also transferred more than 1,600 people to establish the commune's industry; it concentrated more than 11,000 labor forces to build four reservoirs; it launched five 10,000-person fertilizer accumulation campaigns, and the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production was further implemented. Therefore, in the first year after the establishment of the commune, agriculture, industry, and sideline occupations achieved an all-round bumper harvest. In 1959, the output of rice and miscellaneous grains increased across the board, and according to the average calculation of grain unit area, the yield per mu reached 1,007 catties, an increase of 38% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The total output value of commune-run industries from January to October 1959 reached 6,492,000 yuan, more than 20 times more than the total industrial output value for the entire year of 1958. In terms of sideline occupations, by the end of October 1959, the number of live pigs had increased to 48,700, an average of 4 pigs per household, an increase of 66% compared to the same period in 1958. The number of chickens and ducks had increased to nearly 100,000, an increase of about 15% compared to the same period in 1958.
    From the facts that the labor force of the Jinjing Commune was largely liberated, production continued to leap forward, and the living standards of the peasants improved, the masses further realized the superiority of the "large in size and collective in nature" of the people's commune. They discussed it like this: As soon as the banner of the commune is erected and the signs of the dining hall and nursery are hung up, the manpower suddenly increases.
    A United and Harmonious Happy Family
    The family of Li Wenmao, a commune member of the Xinsha Brigade, is a model of a united and harmonious happy family of commune members after the commune. The old society divided his family into pieces, and the new society reunited his family. After the commune, this new family showed a new atmosphere of unity, harmony, and prosperity.
    Before liberation, Li Wenmao was a poor peasant without a place to stand, and his life at that time was "facing the yellow soil with his back to the sky, without food and clothing all year round." In 1939, Japanese invaders burned down Li Wenmao's rented thatched house; then, the landlord forced him to return the tenancy. His wife and son begged along the village, and he barely managed to make a living by doing odd jobs for others. He struggled to raise his children, but the Kuomintang reactionaries conscripted soldiers, forcing his two sons to flee their hometowns to escape disaster. Finally, forced by hunger, he painfully sold his third son to others. The Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries so brutally divided Li Wenmao's family and separated his wife and children! It was not until the national liberation in 1949 that Li Wenmao's family was reunited.
    After the establishment of the people's commune, the implementation of the grain supply system made Li Wenmao's entire family "receive the most important and most reliable social insurance," and they no longer had to worry about eating and drinking; the commune's production leap forward and the great development of collective welfare undertakings, and the socialization of household labor enabled the main members of Li Wenmao's family to obtain jobs that suited their wishes and strengths. Li Wenmao carefully cultivated the dining hall's small vegetable garden, his wife Li Shulian worked as a cook in the dining hall, his eldest son Li Ruilin was elected by the commune members as the production brigade captain, his second son Li Boliang worked in the Changsha Civil Police Brigade, his third son Li Zhongyi was the production brigade's livestock epidemic prevention officer, his fourth son Li Bozhong was studying at Dawo Middle School, his fifth son Li Boxia worked in the joint factory of the production brigade, and his youngest daughter Li Ping also went to school. The two young and strong daughters-in-law at home participated in agricultural production, and the three grandsons entered the kindergarten and nursery. The family lived in spacious, bright, and clean houses. The bedrooms of the two daughters-in-law were furnished with dressing tables and red lacquer cabinets, and the cabinets were plastered with red and green labor merit certificates. During the day, they sent their children to kindergartens and nurseries, and each went to their own labor posts or entered the classrooms of the school; in the evening, they took their children back from the nurseries, and the family reunited, full of joy. The little grandsons were playing lively in the room. Seeing these, Li Wenmao often laughed so hard that he could not close his mouth, and the fatigue of the day disappeared with it. October 17, 1959, was Li Wenmao's fifty-eighth birthday. On this day, in addition to retrieving the meals prepared in the dining hall, he also bought three catties of pork, two catties of fish, and dishes such as eggs and vermicelli, and invited four or five relatives and friends to gather together to celebrate his birthday. Whenever he mentioned today's happiness, Li Wenmao was always full of emotion, with tears in his eyes, and said excitedly: "My family's good days are all given by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." After the commune, the women's labor force in Li Wenmao's family came out to participate in production, and the family income also increased compared to before. In 1959, his family's income increased by about 48% compared to 1958. In the year after the commune, Li Wenmao's family added five new cotton-padded clothes and five pairs of new rubber shoes or leather shoes, and each person added two sets of new single clothes. Everyone in the Li Wenmao family who worked in the commune received their own wages from the commune and disposed of them freely. Equal labor and economic democracy have enhanced the unity and harmony of this family.

    为了更好地生产
    ——记湖南长沙金井公社的集体福利事业龚杰　麦农
    清晨，湖南长沙县金井人民公社公共食堂的服务员忙着给社员准备早餐，桌子板凳排列得整整齐齐，桌上的菜用纱罩罩起，冒着诱人的香味；托儿所和幼儿园的保育员忙着清扫房间和院子，准备迎接可爱的小主人。
    开饭的时候，食堂就是最热闹的场所了。儿孙们争先给年迈的长辈盛饭、倒水，父、母亲切地照顾着孩子们用餐；青年们总爱利用一天来第一次的大聚会来向对手挑战，提出当天劳动竞赛的新目标；读报员、宣传员也不肯放过众人团聚的时机来开展宣传活动。
    用罢早餐，社员们把自己的子女送进托儿所或幼儿园，愉快而无牵无挂地开始了一天的紧张热烈的劳动生活。
    金井人民公社的集体福利事业是怎样兴办起来的呢？
    历史发展的必然产物
    在历史上，贫困的农民中间就有着相互关心、相互援助的习惯。农业生产合作化以后，为了适应集体生产的需要，“家务互助”，在金井这个地区相当流行，劳苦群众之间的深厚友谊，也有了发展。
    1958年，在党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的光辉照耀下，像全国各地一样，金井一带出现了大跃进的新形势，生产集体化的规模空前扩大，分散的个体生活也就更加显得和客观形势不相适应了。这年“双抢”（抢收早稻和抢插晚稻）季节到来的时候，农活多、时间紧，群众普遍感觉分散吃饭，好多问题不能解决。家家户户要半夜三更起来煮“扮禾饭”，因此得不到适当的休息；妇女们被孩子缠着，不能参加“双抢”；男子还要帮助家里挑水砍柴，办米买油盐，也影响农业生产；各家吃饭迟早不同，出工也参差不齐。为了解决这个矛盾，许多社员主张：集体吃饭和集体带孩子。农忙食堂和农忙托儿所应时而起，而且立即产生了巨大的作用。例如原金联农业生产合作社，因为办起了农忙食堂和农忙托儿所，参加农业生产的妇女便比以前增加了一倍多，全社提前完成了“双抢”任务。原来因孩子拖累而很少出工的女社员余淑春，在“双抢”的一个月中，做了三百七十个工分，同壮年男子差不多。群众在实践中创造出来的“家务互助”、农忙食堂和农忙托儿所，反映了集体生产事业的发展、要求家务劳动逐步社会化的必然趋势。
    1958年10月，金井人民公社成立了。工农业生产的双双跃进，特别是这一年粮食空前大丰收，给公社举办各项公共福利事业创造了良好的物质条件。这年，金井公社的粮食总产量达到了四千二百多万斤，比1957年增产46％，每人平均达九百一十三斤。公社宣布实行粮食供给制，群众兴高彩烈地说，从此有了“打不破的金饭碗”。
    人心所向　越办越好
    公共食堂、托儿所这些符合历史要求的新生事物，在金井这个地区刚一出现，就得到了当地党委满腔热情的支持和广大群众的热烈拥护。
    还在金联农业社开始举办“农忙食堂”和“农忙托儿所”的时候，金溪乡党委书记罗淑平就来到金联农业社，帮助试办和总结经验。公社化以后，大量食堂、托儿所建立起来后，公社党委更加注意领导这些福利事业，公社、大队、作业组都有专人管福利事业。公社党委、大队党总支都有重点食堂和托儿所作为“试验”对象，大队干部在这些食堂里，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，及时发现和解决群众生产和生活中的问题。有些食堂初办时，蔬菜不太充裕，公社党委就从长沙市郊买回了大批蔬菜种子，并且聘请了两名种蔬菜的技师，为食堂建立了蔬菜种植试验场，培养种菜能手，传播种菜经验。民沙大队办了个幼儿园，党委看到房子太小，光线又不充足，就把原税务所的整套房子，让给了他们。各个生产大队对幼儿园的副食品供应，也尽量给以照顾。在后来整顿和巩固这些福利事业时，公社党委根据半山区、半丘陵地区居住分散的特点，将食堂适当划小，做到了作业组、食堂、托儿所三结合，进一步使生产和生活拧成了一股绳，领导也更方便了。现在绝大多数的食堂，都建立了一套民主管理、勤俭过日子的制度。
    现在，金井公社的公共福利事业越办越好了。绝大部分食堂都做到了“吃得饱、吃得好、卫生好”；绝大部分托儿所的孩子都带得好。群众切身体验到人民公社举办的集体福利事业的优越性，因而对它们产生了无限的热爱，并且用实际行动来维护集体利益。惠农大队的女社员邹意德，看到食堂缺少一把烧水的壶，唯恐社员缺开水喝，就把外婆送给她的最珍贵的结婚礼物——铜壶，献给了食堂。这把曾经保存了二十多年的铜壶，没有天大的喜事，妇女们是舍不得拿出来的。如今，人民公社成立，集体福利事业办得好，使这位已经四十一岁的妇女年青了。她自愿参加炊事工作，一个人担负了为三十几个人做饭的光荣任务。她把公共食堂当做自己的家，以她勤俭持家的经验，认真地管理着食堂，从不浪费一根柴火、一片菜叶。她处处为大伙着想，在盛产蔬菜的夏季，就腌晒了许多过冬的腌菜、干菜。她还很注意社员们的饮食嗜好，尽力使有特殊习惯的社员能吃饱吃好；她晓得有些孩子们不喜欢吃辣椒，就在每次放辣椒前先给孩子们盛出菜来；有些老年人爱吃软些的饭，她就设法弄得软一点。她从来没有让大家吃过冷饭。这种关心群众的共产主义精神，正是从新的集体生活中成长起来的。这是一位普通的农村妇女，她的所作所为，说明了公共食堂在农村已经落脚生根。
    人手增多了
    公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，不仅解放了妇女劳动力，扩大了农业劳动大军的队伍，而且还大大地节省了贫困农民和单身农民用于筹钱买米的时间。公社化之前，部分人口多、劳动力少、家底较薄，还吃“周转粮”的农户，每年每户总要耗费二十个左右（少的七、八个工，多的三、四十个工）的工，用于筹钱买米。公社实行粮食供给制，办起公共食堂以后，他们再也不为柴、米、油、盐操心费力了。另外，办起了福利事业，还合理地利用了农村中的辅助劳动力。根据五个食堂的调查，食堂、托儿所的事务员、炊事员、保育员、饲养员以及砍柴、种菜等人员，总共三十五人，其中男子半劳动力十三人，妇女全劳动力七人，妇女半劳动力八人，辅助劳动力七人。这些人中五十岁以下的只有妇女十二人。其余二十三人都在五十岁以上，他们都担负起了自己力所能及的工作。
    由于公共食堂和托儿所的建立，解放和挖掘出来了大批劳动力，就使公社能够安排更多的人力，大力发展工业、农业，开展多种经营。金井公社建立后，除胜利地完成了1958年大炼钢铁和秋收秋种任务外，还抽调了二千四百多名青、壮年修筑京广铁路复线，历时三个多月；还抽调了一千六百多人创办公社的工业；集中一万一千多个劳动力，建成了四座水库；开展了五次万人积肥运动，农业生产的“八字宪法”得到了进一步的贯彻执行。因此，在建立公社后的第一年，农业、工业、副业获得了全面丰收。1959年全社稻谷、杂粮样样增产，按照粮食单位面积平均计算，亩产达到一千零七斤，比大跃进的1958年增长38％。社办工业在1959年1月至10月间，总产值达六百四十九万二千余元，比1958年全年的工业总产值还多二十多倍。副业方面，到1959年10月底，生猪已发展到四万八千七百头，每户平均有四头猪，比1958年同期增长了66％。鸡鸭已发展到近十万只，比1958年同期增长了15％左右。
    从金井公社劳动力大批解放，生产继续跃进，农民生活提高的事实中，群众进一步体会到人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，他们是这样议论的：公社的大旗一竖，食堂、托儿所的牌子一挂，人手一下子就增多了。
    团结和睦的幸福家庭
    新沙大队的社员李文茂的一家，是公社化后社员的团结和睦的幸福家庭的榜样。旧社会使他一家人四分五裂，新社会使他家重新团聚。公社化后，这个新家庭，更出现了一片团结和睦、欣欣向荣的新气象。
    在解放以前，李文茂是一个无立锥之地的贫苦农民，那时的生活是“脸朝黄土背朝天，一年到头无吃穿”。1939年日本侵略者烧毁了李文茂租来的茅屋；接着，地主又逼着他退了佃。他的妻子和儿子沿村讨饭，自己靠给人打零工勉强糊口。好容易把儿女拉扯大，国民党反动派抓壮丁，逼得两个儿子都远离家乡逃难，最后为饥饿所迫，他忍痛将第三个儿子卖给了人家。日本帝国主义和国民党反动派就是这样残暴地弄得李文茂的家庭四分五裂、妻离子散！直到1949年全国解放，李文茂的家庭才得重新团圆。
    人民公社建立之后，实行了粮食供给制，使李文茂全家大小都“得到最重要和最可靠的社会保险”，再也不用为吃为喝操心受累了；公社生产大跃进，集体福利事业大发展，家务劳动社会化，使李文茂的家庭内的主要成员，都得到了适合各人意愿和特长的工作。李文茂精心地培育着食堂的小菜园，妻子李淑莲在食堂当炊事员，大儿子李瑞林被社员选举为生产大队长，二儿子李柏梁在长沙市民警大队工作，三儿子李忠义是生产大队的牲畜防疫员，四儿子李柏仲在达?中学读书，五儿子李柏霞在生产大队的联合工厂做工，小女李萍也进学校念书了，在家的两个年青力壮的儿媳，都参加了农业生产，三个孙儿进了幼儿园和托儿所。一家人住着宽敞明亮而整洁的房屋。两个儿媳的卧室，都摆设着梳妆桌和红漆柜，柜上贴着红色绿色的劳动奖状。白天，他们把孩子送进幼儿园、托儿所，各自走上自己的劳动岗位或走进学校的课堂；傍晚，他们又从托儿所接回孩子，一家人团聚在一起，欢乐异常。小孙儿们在房里活泼地嬉戏着，李文茂看到这些，常常乐得合不拢嘴，一天的疲劳都随着消逝了。1959年10月17日是李文茂的五十八岁寿辰，这天，他除了取回食堂里备置的饭菜外，还添买了三斤猪肉、二斤鱼以及鸡蛋、粉条等菜，请来了四五位亲友，团聚一堂庆贺生日。每逢提到今天的幸福，李文茂总是感慨异常，含着满眶热泪，激动地说：“我家的好日子都是共产党和毛主席给的。”公社化以后，李文茂家的妇女劳动力都出来参加了生产，家庭收入也比以前增多了。1959年他全家的收入，比1958年增加了48％左右。公社化后的一年，李文茂家共添置了五件新棉衣和五双新胶鞋或皮鞋，每人添置了两套新单衣。全家在公社劳动的人，各自从公社领回了自己的工资，自由支配。平等的劳动和经济的民主，增进了这个家庭的团结与和睦。
