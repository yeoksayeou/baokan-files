    Poetic and Picturesque, Breathtakingly Beautiful
    ——On the Illustrations of "Red Flag Ballads"
   Qi Lianxiu
    When we appreciate an excellent novel, or read a successful collection of folk songs and poems, we often naturally make this request: it would be wonderful if it were accompanied by touching illustrations! Indeed, a beautiful illustration can, through the unique appeal of fine art, help readers to more vividly understand the content of the original work, to more deeply appreciate the spirit of the original work, and to derive rich artistic enjoyment from it. Many of the illustrations in the "Red Flag Ballads" published by the Red Flag Magazine Press exactly meet this requirement of the general readership, which is a very welcome thing.
  “Red Flag Ballads” has compiled a selection of twenty-four illustrations by eleven artists. For example, Gu Yuan's "Small Pontoon Boat" and "Singing Happiness Falls All Over the Slope", Zhang Guangyu's "Lotus Leaf", Mi Gu's "Nothing is Better Than the People Being the Masters" and "Fishing Boats Shuttle Busily on the River", Li Qun's "A Basket" and Huang Zhou's "Snowy Night Visit" and Zhao Ruichun's "Families North and South of the Mountain" are all relatively excellent works, diverse in form and varied in style, yet they all have common characteristics. That is, they do not adhere to the words of the original, mechanically re-enacting the original, nor do they lack a true understanding of the original, relying on subjective imagination to make descriptions that damage the original meaning, but rather faithfully represent the life expressed in the original while also making creative use of it.
    For example, Gu Yuan's "Singing Happiness Falls All Over the Slope" is a good illustration that both fits the content of the original poem and has a unique artistic creation. The painter does not specifically and in detail depict the natural scenery mentioned in the poem such as pine trees, flowing water, rice fields and pear trees, etc., but focuses on expressing the collective labor and happy life of the commune members. The foreground of the illustration is a large expanse of bright and dazzling peach blossoms, the middle ground is a group of young male and female commune members carrying tools and singing mountain songs down to the fields to work, and the background is another expanse of peach blossoms, as well as several flying birds. This ingenious arrangement in composition vividly expresses the happy mood of the working people in labor. Another example is Zhao Ruichun's "Families North and South of the Mountain", which is also an illustration with a novel composition, beautiful images, bright colors, rich poetic flavor, and a strong folk woodcut style. The original work is a famous Zhuang love song, which sings of the further deepening of the love between a pair of lovers after the establishment of the advanced cooperative, expressing the Zhuang people's unparalleled love for the advanced cooperative and their happy mood of taking the socialist road. The illustration depicts the scene of a pair of young people meeting in the fields during collective labor in the cooperative. From their affectionate glances at each other when they meet, it is not difficult for people to understand their happiness in collective labor, nor is it difficult to see how they will exert their soaring enthusiasm in labor to achieve greater harvests. The artistic conception of the original work becomes even more beautiful and moving because it is accompanied by such an illustration. Due to careful tailoring, the pair of lovers on the screen are neither separated from the environment of collective labor, nor are they portrayed as prominent without being monotonous. The shapes of the two young people (especially the woman depicted in the front) are healthy and beautiful, and their expressions are rich, without any sense of blandness or emptiness. The bright tones render the warm working atmosphere of the screen, and the use of two magpies in the right corner to enliven the screen further enhances the local flavor of the illustration. All of this brilliantly shows the content of the original work, so that the illustration successfully completes its artistic mission.
    Our country's art of illustration has a very rich heritage, which needs to be carefully studied. However, the illustration creation of our new literary works is still relatively young. In recent years, artists have followed the Party's literary and artistic guidelines, gone deep into life, and worked hard, and have achieved great results. Excellent illustrations are constantly emerging in publications all over the country. However, with the vigorous development of the literary cause and the large-scale publication of literary works, the desire of the general readership for artists to create more and better illustrations is becoming increasingly urgent. Although artists have created many exquisite illustrations, compared with the ever-increasing demands of the general readership, both the quality and quantity of works are far from sufficient. It is hoped that publishing houses and artists will be more closely linked and organize artists to carry out creation in a planned way. At the same time, it is also hoped that various newspapers and periodicals will introduce and study the issues of illustration creation more, so as to improve the quality of illustration creation.

    诗情画意　美不胜收
    ——谈“红旗歌谣”插图
  　祁连休
    当我们欣赏一部优秀的小说，或阅读一本成功的民歌和诗集时，往往会很自然地提出这么个要求：要是再配上动人的插图，那就太好了！的确，一幅精美的插图能借着美术作品特有的感染力，帮助读者更形象地了解原作的内容，更深刻地领会原作的精神，并且从中得到丰富的艺术享受。红旗杂志社出版的“红旗歌谣”里的许多插图，正好满足了广大读者的这个要求，真是值得欢迎的事情。 
  “红旗歌谣”共编选了十一位画家所作的二十四幅插图，如古元的“小蓬船”、“唱得幸福落满坡”，张光宇的“荷花叶”，米谷的“好不过人民当了家”、“江上渔船穿梭忙”，力群的“一只篮”和黄胄的“雪夜出诊”以及赵瑞椿的“山南山北一家人”等都是比较优秀的作品，形式多样，风格各异，然而都又具有共同的特色。那就是不拘守原作字句，平板机械地图解原作，也不是没有真正体会原作，但凭主观想像去作有损原意的描写，而是在形象地再现原作所表现的生活时，忠实于原作的精神，同时又是作了富有创造性的发挥。
    例如古元的“唱得幸福落满坡”，就是一幅既吻合诗歌原作内容，又具有独特艺术创造的好插图。画家不具体地、详尽地描绘诗中谈到的青松、流水、稻田和梨树等等自然景色，而是着重在表现社员们集体的劳动和幸福的生活。插图的前景是一大片鲜艳夺目的桃花，中景是一群青年男女社员，扛着工具，高唱着山歌下田去劳动，远景又是一片桃花，还有几只飞鸟。这种构图上的匠心安排，鲜明地表达出了劳动人民在劳动中愉快幸福的心情。又如赵瑞椿的“山南山北一家人”也是一幅构图新颖、形象优美、色彩鲜艳、诗意浓郁并富于民间木刻风味的插图。原作是一首有名的僮族情歌，它歌唱高级社成立后一对情人之间进一步加深的爱情，表达了僮族人民对高级社无比的热爱和走社会主义道路的愉快心情。插图描写的是社里集体劳动时一对青年在地里相遇的情景，从他们相遇时深情的顾盼中，人们不难领会到他们在集体劳动中的幸福，也不难看出他们将要怎样地在劳动中发挥冲天干劲，夺取更大的丰收。原作的意境因为配上了这样的插图而变得越发优美动人了。由于精心的剪裁，一对情人在画面上既没有脱离集体劳动的环境，又表现得突出而不单调。两个青年（特别是那个正面刻划的妇女）造型健美，表情丰富，一点也没有平淡空虚的感觉。明快的色调渲染了画面热烈的劳动气氛，右角用两只喜鹊活跃画面，更增强了插图的乡土风味。所有这一切，都出色地显现了原作的内容，使插图圆满地完成了自己的艺术使命。
    我国的插图艺术，有着极丰富的遗产，需要很好地研究和学习。但是我国新文艺作品的插图创作，还是比较年轻的。近几年来，美术家们遵循着党的文艺方针，深入生活，刻苦钻研，已经获得了很大的成绩。全国各地的出版物中，都不断涌现出优秀的插图作品。但是，随着文学事业的蓬勃发展，随着文学作品的大量出版，广大读者要求美术家们创造出更多更好的插图的愿望也愈来愈迫切了。虽然目前美术家们已经创作了许多精美的插图，但与广大读者的日益增强的要求相比，无论作品的质和量都显得非常不够。希望出版社和美术家们更密切地联系，有计划地组织美术家们进行创作。同时，也希望各报刊多介绍和研究插图创作的问题，以提高插图创作的质量。
