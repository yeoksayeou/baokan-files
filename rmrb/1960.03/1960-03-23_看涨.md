    Bullish
    Wu Lü
    On March 4th, the *Liberation Daily* published a letter from Comrade Chen Zhong, the deputy secretary of a factory's Party branch. The letter stated that during discussions about this year's plan, "some comrades had a big appetite, proposing not only to overfulfill the state plan and put more than ten kinds of precision new products into production, but also to make the products reach the first-class level in the country and strive to become an advanced factory in the industry." Comrade Chen Zhong, however, believed that "making all products qualified, I think, is something that should be strived for and can be done." The task of manufacturing high-grade, precision new products is also "glorious and should be worked on diligently"; however, "it is difficult to make all products reach the first-class level." He emphasized that "doing things should proceed from reality," and "it is best not to put things that are not sure of being done into the plan, and wait until they are done in the future, so as to avoid the plan being too big and not being able to be done, which would be passive." Now, the *Liberation Daily* is organizing a discussion on Comrade Chen Zhong's thinking under the title "How can we have lofty ambitions."
    This discussion is very meaningful. It seems that the difference of opinion between those comrades with "big appetites" and Comrade Chen Zhong in this factory is not about whether or not to complete the state plan, but about whether or not to overfulfill the state plan. In the language currently popular in planning departments, those comrades with "big appetites" have adopted a "bullish" attitude towards completing the state plan. They believe that the state plan is only a must-achieve target, and they also want to find ways to "raise" it. That is to say, the plan must not only be completed, but also overfulfilled; new products must not only be put into production, but also reach the first-class level; in short, it is necessary to strive for the top. Comrade Chen Zhong does not want to be "bullish." In his mind, the planned tasks stipulated by the state are already the highest indicators, which "should be worked on diligently"; to "raise" it further is "difficult to do." The difference between these two opinions is, in essence, a question of whether or not there are lofty ambitions.
    The question of whether or not there are lofty ambitions is, in the final analysis, a question of whether or not there is a determination to go through fire and water to strive for the realization of our beautiful communist ideals; manifested in the production and life of enterprises, an important point is what attitude to take towards the state plan. Is it right to "do things should proceed from reality"? Yes. Is it right to "it is best not to put things that are not sure of being done into the plan"? Also yes. We have always advocated "leaving room for maneuver" when formulating plans, which means respecting reality and proceeding from reality. However, people with lofty ambitions and people without lofty ambitions always have very different views on the actual situation, on what things are sure to be done, and what things are not sure to be done. People with lofty ambitions have a comprehensive understanding of the actual situation. They see unfavorable conditions, but also see favorable conditions. More importantly, they see that unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions. Therefore, they are always full of energy, always full of confidence, and resourceful. People without lofty ambitions have a one-sided understanding of the actual situation. They exaggerate unfavorable conditions, ignore favorable conditions, and cannot see that unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions. Therefore, they are always lacking in energy, and feel unsure about some things that are originally sure to be done. This is the first test of whether people have lofty ambitions in the question of how to treat the state plan.
    The next test is whether to be "bullish."
    Formulating plans requires "leaving room for maneuver," and implementing plans requires being "bullish." This is the dialectic of planning work, and it is also a two-step working method. Why should we "leave room for maneuver" when formulating plans? Because people's understanding of objective things always has a gradual development process. We can formulate a plan that roughly conforms to objective reality based on general laws, but it is impossible to perceive all the details in the development of things from the beginning. It is necessary to "leave room for maneuver" in order to take the initiative and be in an invincible position. This is the first step. With the start and continuation of production practice, the contradictions of things are gradually fully exposed. With the exertion of people's subjective initiative, all aspects of objective things are also undergoing more favorable changes. At this time, it is necessary to be "bullish," take the second step, seize favorable opportunities, mobilize the positive factors of all parties, and push production to a greater climax.
    People with lofty ambitions are all "bullish." Their appetites are always very big, but when things are not sure of, they do not include them in the plan, but try every means to create conditions, pay attention to being "bullish," and once the conditions are ripe, they will guide the situation, make the subjective adapt to the rapidly developing objective situation, and fully promote production to "rise" up. If the quantity is completed, it must be overfulfilled, if the quality is good, it must be better, if the cost is low, it must be lower, in short, it is continuous leap forward, without end. People without lofty ambitions, although they may not all be "bearish" about the production market, their appetites are very small. They are satisfied if the quantity indicators can be completed, and they are also satisfied if the quality is qualified. "Overfulfillment," "first-class," etc., are all "difficult to do" in their opinion. As a result, the subjective lags behind the objective, the situation has developed, the understanding has not kept up, opportunities are missed, and many things that were originally sure to be done eventually become "difficult to do."
    Now, the situation is very good. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has become a great movement. It is reported that the enterprises under the eight industrial bureaus in Shanghai have implemented more than 360,000 technical innovation proposals by the beginning of March, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has increased from 51% to 70%. This excellent situation has greatly changed the conditions for completing the production plan, and it is necessary to be "bullish." Shanghai is doing just that. Many companies are determined to achieve their annual plans ahead of schedule. The news about the Beijing Electron Tube Factory published today also talks about being "bullish." After one battle is won, another battle comes; the production plan for the first quarter is completed ahead of schedule, and the second quarter will also be a complete success; more than 3,000 technical innovation projects have been implemented, and new and higher demands have been put forward. Of course, there will also be some people who are unwilling to be "bullish" or have not yet learned to be "bullish." This does not matter. Production does not depend on the views of a few people. If a few people do not "rise," the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses will still promote it to "rise" up.

    看涨
    吴滤
    3月4日，解放日报发表了一个工厂党支部副书记陈忠同志的来信。信上说：他们在讨论今年的规划时，“有些同志胃口很大，提出了不但要超额完成国家计划，把十多种精密的新产品投入生产，而且还要使产品都达到全国第一流的水平，争取成为本行业的先进厂”。陈忠同志则认为：“使所有产品都合格，我觉得是应该努力也是可以做到的”，制造高级、精密的新产品的任务，也是“光荣的，应该努力去做”；但是，“所有产品都要达到第一流，我觉得难于做到”。他强调“做事应该从实际出发”，“没有把握做到的事情，最好不要订到规划里去，等将来做到了再说，免得规划订得太大，说到做不到，反而被动”。现在，解放日报正以“怎样才能立雄心大志”为题，就陈忠同志的思想组织讨论。
    这个讨论，很有意义。看来，这个工厂里那些“胃口很大”的同志和陈忠同志的意见分歧，不在于要不要完成国家计划，而在于要不要超额完成国家计划。用现在计划工作部门流行的语言来说，那些“胃口很大”的同志，对完成国家计划采取了“看涨”的态度。他们认为国家计划只是一个必成的指标，还要想办法“涨”上去。这就是说，计划不但要完成，而且要超额完成；新产品不但要投入生产，而且要达到第一流的水平；总之，是要力争上游。陈忠同志则不想“看涨”。国家规定的计划任务，在他的心目中已经是最高的指标了，“应该努力去做”；再“涨”上去，就是“难于做到”的了。这两种意见的分歧，实质上，确实是一个有没有雄心大志的问题。
    有没有雄心大志的问题，归根到底，是对于实现我们美好的共产主义理想，有没有赴汤蹈火奋力追求的决心问题；表现在企业的生产生活中，很重要的一条，就是对国家计划采取什么态度的问题。“做事应该从实际出发”对不对呢？对。“没有把握做到的事情，最好不要订到规划里去”对不对呢？也对。我们订计划一向主张“留有余地”，也就是主张尊重实际，从实际出发。不过，怀有雄心大志和缺乏雄心大志的人，对于实际的认识，对于什么是有把握做到的事情，什么是没有把握做到的事情，总是看法很不相同的。怀有雄心大志的人，对于实际的认识是全面的，他们看到不利的条件，也看到有利的条件，更看到不利的条件可以转化为有利的条件，因而总是干劲十足，总是满怀信心，足智多谋。缺乏雄心大志的人，对于实际的认识是片面的，他们夸大了不利的条件，忽视了有利的条件，更看不到不利的条件可以转化为有利的条件，因而总是干劲不足，对一些本来有把握做到的事情，也觉得没有把握。这是在怎样对待国家计划的问题上，考验人们有没有雄心大志的第一个课题。
    接着的一个考验，就是是不是“看涨”。
    订计划要“留有余地”，执行计划又要“看涨”，这是计划工作的辩证法，也是一种分两步走的工作方法。为什么订计划要“留有余地”呢？因为人们对客观事物的认识总有一个逐步发展的过程，我们可以根据一般规律订出一个大体上符合客观实际的计划，却不可能在一开始的时候就洞察事物发展中的全部细节。必须“留有余地”，才能掌握主动，立于不败之地。这是第一步。随着生产实践的开始和继续，事物的矛盾逐渐得到充分的暴露，随着人们主观能动性的发挥，客观事物的各个方面也在发生更加有利的变化，这时候就要“看涨”，走出第二步，抓住有利时机，调动各方面的积极因素，把生产推向更大的高潮。
    怀有雄心大志的人，都是“看涨”的。他们的胃口总是很大，只不过当事情还没有把握的时候，并不把它列入计划，而是千方百计地创造条件，注意“看涨”，一旦条件成熟，就因势利导，使主观适应飞跃发展的客观形势，全力促进生产“涨”上去，数量完成了还要超额，质量好了还要更好，成本低了还要更低，总之是不断跃进，永无止境。缺乏雄心大志的人，对于生产的行情，虽然未必都是“看跌”的，但是胃口却是非常之小，数量指标可以完成就满足了，质量合格也满足了，“超额”、“第一流”等等，在他们看来，都是“难于做到”的。其结果，就是主观落后于客观，形势发展了，认识没有跟上来，坐失良机，许多本来是有把握做到的事情，最后真的变成“难于做到”的了。
    现在，形势好得很，技术革新和技术革命运动已经成为一个伟大的运动。报载：上海市八个工业局所属的企业，到3月上旬，已经实现的技术革新建议就有三十六万多条，机械化和半机械化的程度已经从51％提高到70％。这一派大好形势，就使完成生产计划的条件发生了很大的变化，就要“看涨”。上海正是这样做的，许多企业都决心提前实现全年规划。今天发表的北京电子管厂的新闻，讲的也是“看涨”，一个战役胜利了，又来一个战役；第一季度生产计划提前完成了，第二季度还要满堂红；三千多项技术革新项目实现了，又提出新的、更高的要求。当然，也会有一些不愿意“看涨”或者还没有学会“看涨”的人，这不要紧，生产不以少数人的看法为转移，少数人不“涨”，广大群众的冲天干劲还是要促它“涨”上去的。
