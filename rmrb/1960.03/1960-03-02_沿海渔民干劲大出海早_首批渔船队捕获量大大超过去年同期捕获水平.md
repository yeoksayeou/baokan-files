Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: With the spring warmth and abundant fish, the first batch of fishing boats participating in spring fishing along China's coast are setting sail one after another. Preparations are being stepped up to welcome the spring fishing season. Spring fishing in inland freshwater fishing areas has also begun.

The early spawning of small yellow croaker in Zhejiang's coastal areas has arrived earlier this year, and coastal people's communes have selected more than 50,000 fishermen to go to sea to intercept them. In the first few days of February, the small yellow croaker caught by the Zhoushan County fishing fleet was equivalent to about 60% of the county's total small yellow croaker production in previous years. In Fujian's coastal areas, 100,000 fishermen have already gone to sea, and the catch since the spring fishing season has also increased significantly compared to the same period last year. In the north, the fleets of the Luda Aquatic Products Company and the Tianjin Tanggu Fisheries Commune set sail earlier this year, crossing the Bohai Sea to the Weihai-Yantai fishing grounds and the vicinity of the Yellow River Estuary to fish. The Tanggu Fisheries Commune fleet uses various innovative nets for fishing, often catching more than 1,000 catties of fish and shrimp in one net. After the Qingdao City fishing fleet set sail earlier, the fish and shrimp caught in January also increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year. At present, the spring fishing season has only just begun, and the peak season has not yet arrived. The main fishing forces in various coastal areas are still actively preparing to go to sea during the peak season. Coastal fishing ports are full of busy scenes welcoming the spring fishing season. Lusi Port, near Lusiyang in Jiangsu Province, the largest fishing ground for spring fishing, now has more than 16,000 fishermen concentrated on rushing to repair and build ships and nets. They are vigorously carrying out technological innovations to ensure that they have good boats and tools this year, and that four times more motorized sailing ships than last year will participate in spring fishing. In Shandong's coastal areas, more than 100,000 people are involved in preparations for the spring fishing season, and the vast majority of preparations for going to sea have been completed. Six counties and cities in Guangdong, including Haifeng and Zhanjiang, have repaired more than 200,000 various fishing nets and more than 100,000 various fishing hooks, so that most fishing boats have one team of people and multiple sets of tools, capable of performing various operations and catching various fish and shrimp.

Due to the active innovation of boats and tools by coastal people's communes, the number of motorized sailing ships going to sea this spring fishing season will more than double compared to last year. The safety of fishing boats has also been strengthened compared to last year. Many large ships are equipped with radios, and a safety net has been established between the fleets.

The spring fishing harvest in inland freshwater fishing areas is also very good. The joint large-scale encirclement and capture organized by eight counties in Dongting Lake has caught more than 100,000 dan of fish from January to mid-February, creating the highest record for fishing in Dongting Lake during the same period in previous years. Hubei, Hebei, Zhejiang and other provinces have broken the past habit of only having small-scale fishing in the spring, and have dispatched boats to fish extensively. In the fishing process, they combine fishing with aquaculture, pay attention to protecting parent fish and small fish, and put the captured parent fish and small fish into fish ponds or reservoirs for feeding.

    沿海渔民干劲大出海早
    首批渔船队捕获量大大超过去年同期捕获水平
    新华社1日讯　春暖鱼肥，我国沿海参加春汛捕捞的第一批渔船正纷纷扬帆出海。为了迎接春汛旺季的到来，准备工作正在加紧进行。内地淡水渔区的春季捕捞工作也已经开始。
    浙江沿海小黄鱼的早汛今年提早到来，沿海各人民公社已选派五万多渔民出海拦捕。2月的头几天，舟山县渔船队捕获的小黄鱼，就相当于往年这个县小黄鱼汛总产量的60％左右。福建沿海已有十万渔民出海，春汛以来的捕获量也比去年同期增加很多。北方，旅大水产公司的船队和天津塘沽渔业公社的船队，今年提前出海，横跨渤海到威（海市）烟（台）渔场和黄河口附近捕鱼。塘沽渔业公社船队使用各种革新的网具捕捞，往往一网就捕获鱼虾一千多斤。青岛市的渔业船队提前出海后，1月份捕捞的鱼虾也比去年同期增加了三倍多。目前春汛仅是开始，大旺季节尚未到来，沿海各地的捕捞主力都还在积极准备旺季出海。沿海渔港到处是一片迎接春汛的繁忙景象。春汛最大渔场——江苏省吕泗洋附近的吕泗港，现在集中了一万六千多渔民在突击修造船网。他们大力进行技术革新，保证今年有很好的船具，有比去年多四倍的机帆船参加春汛捕捞。山东沿海投入春汛旺季准备工作的有十多万人，绝大部分出海的准备工作已经就绪。广东海丰、湛江等六个县市已修好各种渔网二十多万张，各种钓钩十多万枚，使大部分渔船都作到了一班人马，多套工具，能进行多种作业，捞捕多种鱼虾。
    由于沿海人民公社积极革新船具，今年春汛出海的机帆船将比去年增加一倍多。渔船的安全工作也比去年加强了，许多大船配置了收音机，船队之间建立了安全网。
    内地淡水渔区的春捕收获也很好。洞庭湖滨八个县组织的联合大围捕，以1月到2月中旬已捕鱼十万多担，创造了洞庭湖历年同期捕捞的最高纪录。湖北、河北、浙江等省今年都打破过去春季只是小捕捞的习惯，出动船只，大捞大捕。捕捞中结合养殖工作，注意保护亲鱼和小鱼，捕获的亲鱼和小鱼都放进了鱼塘或水库喂养。
