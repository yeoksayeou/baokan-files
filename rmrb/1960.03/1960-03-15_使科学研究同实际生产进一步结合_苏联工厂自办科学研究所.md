Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 12th: The Soviet Union is adopting various methods, such as factories establishing their own scientific research institutes and scholars going into production, to further integrate scientific research work with actual production.

Currently, factories and enterprises are using their own resources to establish scientific research institutions. The nation's first factory scientific research institution was established by the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant. In the half-year since its establishment, this institute has solved many practical problems for the factory and improved the level of scientific research related to heavy machinery manufacturing. The Ural Electrical Equipment Factory in the Sverdlovsk Economic Zone has also established a factory scientific research institute, which has various laboratories related to electrical equipment production. This type of institute serves as both the factory's design institution and the research institution for the industrial sector. Some factories, after establishing scientific research institutions, have more effectively carried out the work of improving the technical and scientific level of their employees and promoting advanced experiences. For example, the Advanced Labor Methods Research Institute recently established by the Barnaul Internal Combustion Engine Factory in the Altai Territory has promoted the most valuable advanced experiences created throughout the country.

At the same time, scientific and educational institutions have also opened branches within factories and enterprises. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has opened a comprehensive laboratory at the Moscow State First Ball Bearing Manufacturing Plant. Employees call this laboratory "the Academy of Sciences in the factory." This comprehensive laboratory has already worked with the factory's employees to solve some complex automation problems. The Soviet Plastics Scientific Research Institute has also opened a synthetic compound laboratory at the Fergana Hydrolysis Factory in Uzbekistan, preparing to turn this factory into a center for scientific research.

Factory employees in various regions are also actively engaged in scientific research to solve important production problems.

Scientific research work approaching actual production is also one of the important measures taken by the Soviet Union to improve scientific research work and organizational structures. For example, the main laboratories originally planned for the Machine Manufacturing Institute of the Belorussian Republic Academy of Sciences have all been relocated to factories.

### 使科学研究同实际生产进一步结合  苏联工厂自办科学研究所

    使科学研究同实际生产进一步结合
    苏联工厂自办科学研究所
    新华社莫斯科12日电　苏联采取工厂开办科学研究所和学者到生产中去等多种方式，使科学研究工作同实际生产进一步结合了起来。
    现在各工厂企业都在用自己的力量创办科学研究机构。全国第一座工厂科学研究机构是由乌拉尔重型机器制造厂设立的。这个研究所成立半年来已经为工厂解决了许多实际问题，提高了有关重型机器制造的科学研究水平。斯维德洛夫斯克经济区乌拉尔电气设备工厂也创办了工厂科学研究所，这座研究所设有各种有关电气设备生产的实验室。这种研究所既是工厂的设计机构，又是本工业部门的研究机构。有些工厂在成立科学研究机构以后，更加有效地开展了提高职工的技术科学水平和推广先进经验的工作。例如阿尔泰边疆区巴尔瑙尔内燃机工厂最近所成立的先进劳动方法研究所，便推广了全国各地所创造的最有价值的先进经验。
    与此同时，科学教育机关也在工厂企业内开设了分支机构。苏联科学院在莫斯科国家第一滚珠轴承制造厂开办了一个综合实验室。职工们把这种实验室叫做“工厂里的科学院”。这个综合实验室已经同工厂的职工一道解决了一些复杂的自动化问题。苏联塑料科学研究所也在乌兹别克的弗尔干纳水解工厂开设了合成化合物实验室，准备将这个工厂变成科学研究的中心。
    各地工厂的职工也在积极地从事科学研究工作，以解决生产中的重要问题。
    科学研究工作接近实际生产也是苏联改进科学研究工作和组织机构的重要措施之一。例如白俄罗斯共和国科学院机器制造研究所原订主要实验室都已改设在工厂里面。
