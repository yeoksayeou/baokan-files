Mobilize the Masses Thoroughly, Boost Morale Adequately, Rely on Our Own Efforts, Combine Indigenous and Foreign Methods
Even a Weak Foundation Can Achieve Mechanization and Automation
Pingan's Grain and Oil Processing Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization Degree Quickly Jumped From 10% to 90%
The Equipment-Lagging Shenyang Standard Parts Factory Built Fifteen Automatic Production Lines in One Month

　　This newspaper, Nanning, March 13th, (dispatch) Guangxi's Pingnan County vigorously carries out mass movements for technological innovation in grain and oil processing. After a short period of intensive effort, the county has comprehensively achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and oil processing, becoming a red flag for technological innovation in rural grain and oil processing in the autonomous region.

　　Currently, the county has built 896 mechanized and semi-mechanized grain and oil processing plants (workshops) using mechanical power, water power, and animal power. In grain processing, the four main processing steps of grinding grain, milling rice, sieving, and winnowing, and in oil processing, the three main processing steps of dehulling, crushing, and pressing, have all been freed from manual operation. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire grain and oil processing process has increased from 10% in the past to over 90%. Before the reform, the county's daily oil processing capacity was more than 540,000 jin, requiring 5,000 people. Now, the daily processing capacity has increased to 1.4 million jin, requiring only 1,100 people. The oil and grain yield rate has also increased by 1.5% and 4%, respectively.

　　In the past, the foundation for grain and oil processing in this county was weak. More than 90% of the areas relied on heavy and backward hand-operated mills, foot-operated devices, and sledgehammers for processing, requiring 1.8 million labor days per year. Grain and oil processing has become an important component of rural production and life, as well as a very weak link. The county Party committee comprehensively analyzed this situation and, based on the principle of "grasping both production and processing," issued a call to the county's processing departments to "vigorously engage in technological innovation and eliminate manual processing." It also designated the county's Technological Reform Committee to strengthen leadership, with designated personnel in the communes and brigades responsible, and a secretary in both the county Party committee and the commune Party committee personally overseeing it. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, comprehensive arrangements were made, and various departments were responsible for division of labor and carried out cooperation. The grain and oil departments were responsible for site selection, design, and technical guidance. The Technological Reform Committee was responsible for inspection and supervision. The county agricultural tool factory was responsible for manufacturing machine parts and tools, and had successively produced 234 rice milling machines and 28 grain grinding machines for the masses to evaluate and imitate.

　　All communes and brigades in the county formulated plans and resolutely implemented the principle of "starting with indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods," relying on their own efforts to solve the difficulties in raw materials and funds, designing and constructing simultaneously. In more than a month, the county formed a vigorous upsurge of technological innovation in grain and oil processing. 80% of the factory buildings were built using bricks, tiles, and wood from dilapidated temples and old houses. The agricultural machinery factories of various communes used the local steel and iron left over from the mass steelmaking campaign to manufacture more than 130 rice milling machines and threshing machines. The masses of Da You Brigade of Da Xin Commune offered suggestions and ideas, using cowhide and hemp rope instead of tape, wooden shafts instead of iron shafts, and alum instead of magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride, spending only 44 yuan on buying iron nails to build a grain processing factory with a daily output of 15,000 jin of rice. After a major campaign by the masses, following the realization of grain processing mechanization by the end of last year, the county also achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of oil pressing in the recent half month.

　　Technical issues were the main problems in the reform. Pingnan County adopted various methods such as "learning from outside experiences," on-site meetings, short-term training, on-the-job learning, and leading the new with the old to train 230 technicians. The problem of insufficient technical strength has been basically solved.

　　According to Liaoning Daily, the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory has achieved brilliant results in its march towards production automation. This factory, which was merged from five small factories, still had most of its workers using heavy production methods on old machines that accounted for 60% of the factory's equipment by the end of last year. After nearly two months of arduous struggle by the workers, the degree of automated operation in the factory has now reached 71.65%, and it has sixteen automatic production lines. In the one month from late January to late February alone, fifteen automatic lines were built.

　　In order to achieve technological transformation at high speed, the factory's workers were full of energy in automation, diligently studying and thinking, closely cooperating, seizing every minute, and bravely fighting against all difficulties. In creating the first automatic nut production line, they broke through more than fifty technical problems. Initially, "punching" and "deburring" were divided into two processes as before, but the results of the experiment could not guarantee accuracy. They then combined them into one process, but after punching the hole, the burrs below could not be removed. To solve this problem, the technicians and workers studied for more than a week, and finally worker Wang Yude came up with the idea of making a platform on the lower punch, which was finally successful. Just as this problem was solved, they encountered the problem of how to automatically send the raw materials to the processing part and automatically eject them after processing. Initially, they used a disc feeder, but it could not guarantee quality, so they changed to another method, which was changed eight times before they finally came up with the clamping feeder method. The original plan was to achieve automatic quenching around May 1st, but the quenching workers and technicians decided to complete it ahead of schedule. So they studied together and drew the drawings in three days and nights. Workers from the machine repair workshop, tool workshop, and second workshop took the initiative to help them process parts. Normally, one shift could only weld one furnace package, but veteran welder Wang Shaoqing worked hard all night and helped them weld all three furnace packages. During the installation, the technicians and workers also worked hard day and night, and as a result, they made the automatic quenching production line in only eight days.

　　In the march towards automation, this factory implemented the principles of simplicity, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and relying on its own efforts, overcoming difficulties and vigorously promoting the development of this movement. Although the amount of transformation was very large, they rarely used new national materials and occupied production time. When the workers in the first workshop were改造transforming the polishing machine, they needed four gear wheels. Because the factory did not have these parts, they immediately changed the original design and used four rust removal rollers instead. When the workers in the second workshop were converting the old press into automation, they needed some idler wheels. In order to save steel for the country and allow the foundry workers to use their time on more important work, they made their own replacements by welding old iron plates. The automatic quenching line needed to install a worm box. There was not enough time for casting, so they welded it with iron plates. Without a lathe to turn the eye, they used gas welding to burn it. These automation devices made with indigenous methods and scrap materials not only avoided the delay of waiting for external purchases or processing, but also had the same good results.

　　This factory also adopted various methods to put the successfully transformed automatic lines and automated single machines into production immediately. From the beginning, they implemented the "three-combination" team's approach to handle everything from start to finish. Whichever technician helped to transform an automatic line or single machine, he would help the workers improve and master it until the automatic line could produce smoothly. Because the automatic line is composed of various machine tools, the original professional workers could not be completely familiar with it, so they were all operated by the workers who participated in the transformation and were familiar with the performance of the automatic line first, and production was started immediately. After other workers gradually became familiar with it, it was transferred. In this way, automatic lines and automated single machines can quickly exert their power. The factory's daily production level in January increased by 19% compared to November of last year, and in February it increased by 15% compared to January.

    群众发动透　干劲鼓得足　自力更生　洋土结合
    底子差也能实现机械化自动化
    平南粮油加工机械化半机械化程度很快由10％跃到90％
    设备落后的沈阳标准件厂一个月建成十五条生产自动线
    本报南宁13日电　广西平南县大搞粮油加工技术革新群众运动，经过短期突击，全面实现粮油加工机械化、半机械化，成为自治区农村粮油加工技术革新的一面红旗。
    目前，全县已建成机械动力、水力、畜力的机械化、半机械化粮油加工厂（坊）八百九十六个，在粮食加工方面的磨谷、碾米、筛、风等四个主要加工工序和油料加工方面的脱壳、碎粉、打榨等三个主要加工工序，已全部摆脱手工操作，整个粮油加工过程的机械化、半机械化程度已从过去的10％提高到90％以上。改革前，全县日榨粮油能力五十四万多斤，需五千人，现在，日榨能力已提高到一百四十万斤，却只需一千一百人。粮油出品率也分别提高1．5％和4％。
    这个县过去粮油加工基础薄弱，90％以上地区是靠笨重落后的手磨、脚踏、抡大锤来加工，全年需要一百八十万个劳动日。粮油加工，成为农村生产与生活方面一个重要的组成部分，也是一个十分薄弱的环节。县委全面分析了这种情况，本着“既抓生产，又抓加工”的原则，向全县的加工部门发出“大搞技术革新，消灭人力加工”的号召，并指定县技术改革委员会加强领导，公社、大队专人负责，县委和公社党委都有一个书记亲自掌握。在党委统一领导下，全面安排，各部门分工负责，开展协作，粮油部门负责选点，设计和技术指导，技术改革委员会负责检查督促，县农具厂负责制造机件工具，先后已生产了碾米机二百三十四台、磨谷机二十八台，交群众评选仿制。
    全县各公社、大队都订出规划，坚决贯彻“土法上马、土洋结合”方针，自力更生解决原料，资金困难，边设计、边施工，在一个多月时间内，全县就形成轰轰烈烈粮油加工技术革新热潮。80％的厂房是利用破烂庙宇、旧房的砖瓦、木料盖成，各公社农械厂利用大办钢铁时留下的土钢、土铁制造了一百三十多架碾米机、打谷机。大新公社大有大队群众献计献策，以牛皮、麻绳代胶带，木轴代铁轴、白矾代氧化镁和氯化镁，只花四十四元买铁钉建设日产一万五千斤大米的粮食加工厂。经过群众大突击、全县继去年年底实现粮食加工机械化后，在最近的半个月内，又实现了榨油机械化、半机械化。
    技术问题是改革中的主要问题。平南县采取“出外取经”、现场会议、短期训练、就厂学习、以老带新等多种方式，培训了二百三十个技术人员。技术力量不足的问题基本上得到解决。
    据辽宁日报消息　在向生产自动化进军中，沈阳标准件厂取得了光辉的成就。这个由五个小厂合并起来的工厂，到去年年末，大部分工人还是用笨重的生产方法在占全厂设备60％的老旧机器上工作；经过职工近两个月的艰苦奋战，现在全厂自动化操作程度已经达到71．65％，并且拥有十六条生产自动线。仅在1月下旬到2月下旬的一个月内，就建成了十五条自动线。
    为了高速度地实现技术改造，这个厂的职工在搞自动化中，干劲冲天，猛钻苦想，紧密协作，抢分夺秒，勇敢地和一切困难作斗争。在创制第一条螺母生产自动线时，他们足足冲破了五十多个技术难题。最初把“冲孔”、“刮边”按原来的那样分成两道工序，实验的结果不能保证精度，他们又并为一道工序，但是冲完孔后，下边的毛刺没法刮掉；为了解决这个问题，技术人员和工人研究了一个多星期，最后才由工人王玉德想法在下边的冲具上制成一个台，方才成功。这个问题刚刚解决，又碰到了如何把毛料自动送到加工部位、加工完了再自动弹出去的问题，最初他们采用的是圆盘送料器，但是同样不能保证质量，于是又改成另一种方法，前后改了八次，最后才想出了夹钳送料的方法。原计划在“五一”前后实现沾火自动化，但是沾火工人和技术人员决心提前完成。于是他们共同研究，用三个昼夜，画出了图纸。机修车间、工具车间、二车间的工人主动来帮助他们加工部件，焊一个炉包，平常一个班只能焊成一个，而老电焊工人王少清苦战了一个通宵，帮助他们把三个炉包全焊出来。在安装的时候，技术人员和工人又自己动手，日夜苦干，结果只用了八天就制成了沾火生产自动线。
    在向自动化进军中，这个厂执行了因陋就简，洋土结合，自力更生的原则，战胜了困难，有力地促进了这个运动的发展。尽管改造的工程量很大，但是他们很少用国家的新材料和占用生产时间。一车间工人在改造抛光机时，需用四个牙轮，因为工厂没有这种部件，他们就立刻改变了原设计，用四个除锈滚来代替。二车间工人在把旧压力机改成自动化时，需要一些惰轮，为了给国家节约钢铁和使铸工把时间用在更重要的工作上，他们自己动手，用旧铁板焊接起来代用。沾火自动线需要安装涡姆盒，现铸造来不及，他们就用铁板焊，没有车床来车眼，他们就用气焊烧。这些用土法和废旧材料做成的自动化装置，不仅免得等待外购或加工而旷日费时，效果也同样良好。
    这个工厂还采取各种办法使改造成功的自动线和自动化单机马上投入生产。他们一开始就实行了“三结合”小组一包到底的做法。一条自动线或单机由哪个技术员帮助改造的，他就帮助工人改进和掌握，直到这条自动线能够顺利生产为止。由于自动线是多种机床组成的，原来的专业工人不可能完全熟悉，所以他们都由参与改造的、熟悉了自动线性能的工人先来操纵，马上进行生产，等其他工人逐渐熟悉之后才移交。这样，自动线和自动单机很快就能发挥威力。全厂1月份日产水平比去年11月份提高了19％，2月份又比1月份提高了15％。
