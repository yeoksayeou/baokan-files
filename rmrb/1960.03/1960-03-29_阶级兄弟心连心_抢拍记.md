    A Record of "Class Brothers, Hearts Linked"
    Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, Mǐn Fēng, Jì Fēng
    At 3:30 PM on March 5th, our studio received a call regarding more than 100 commune members in Yù County, Héběi Province, suffering from food poisoning. The Zhāngjiākǒu Municipal Party Committee called the Beijing Special Medicine Business Department requesting assistance, and was preparing for immediate airdrop of medicine. We immediately decided to dispatch two cameramen on the plane to capture the event.
    At 5:30 PM, a transport plane took off from Beijing. This was a special plane dispatched by the Civil Aviation Administration Beijing Bureau to deliver medicine. Comrade Xīn Yǐng, Deputy Director of the Navigation Department of the Capital Airport, accompanied the special plane to carry out the airdrop mission. Before takeoff, there was no time to tie lights and parachutes to the medicine boxes; these tasks were carried out after takeoff. Cameraman Chén Kǎi Chū knew he would vomit as soon as he got on the plane, so he found a seat by the window and insisted on filming the preparations for the airdrop. At 6:12 PM, the plane arrived over Yù County. People pointed to the underside of the fuselage and shouted, "Airdrop signal, signal, nine bonfires! White cross!" Everyone prepared. Looking down from the cabin door, the crowd waiting to receive the medicine could be faintly seen. The flight crew dropped the medicine towards the white cross.
    At the same time, our studio Party committee convened an emergency meeting, deciding to send another team of cameramen by train overnight to Yù County to film this rescue battle as a documentary.
    The train sped towards Zhāngjiākǒu in the darkness. In the carriage, many passengers were snoring. The filming team sat in a corner of the carriage, no one sleeping, no one saying a word, sometimes anxiously looking out of the dark window, listening to the monotonous clickety-clack of the train. This team embarking on the journey now had a common belief: we must record this miracle of fighting against the god of death! This is the glory of communist thought! We must do our best to capture it! This is the glorious responsibility given to us by the Party!
    As dawn broke, the train arrived in Zhāngjiākǒu. The cameramen rushed to the Municipal Party Committee, just as the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee and representatives of various communes were about to go to Bāmǎfāng to visit the patients. Therefore, they drove non-stop to Bāmǎfāng. In the bumpy car, the director and cameraman jointly studied and determined the filming outline. Upon arriving at Bāmǎfāng, they set up the cameras at the entrance of the village before even entering, waiting to capture the scene.
    The rescue was underway, and the filming was also underway. For every newsreel worker participating in this battle, it was less like work and more like receiving the most profound and vivid communist education.
    Under the care of the Party and with the support of all parties, the precious lives of one hundred and twenty-five class brothers were saved! The Bái Yù family of four, who were the most severely poisoned, were all saved! Bái Yù's wife, Wáng Yùxiān, was moved to tears, saying, "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party saved my family's lives!" When the poisoned people heard that medicine was sent by plane from Beijing, they were all moved and said, "This is Chairman Mao sending a divine eagle to deliver divine medicine to us!" The Party's kindness is truly beyond words. Lǐ Liányǒu, a model worker who was poisoned, expressed his determination to do a good job in production to thank the Party and Chairman Mao.
    At the studio, the battle was also underway. On Sunday noon, Liáng Guózhù from the developing and printing workshop received a notice: the first batch of negatives of "Class Brothers, Hearts Linked" had been sent from Yù County. Immediately, he came to the studio to prepare. As soon as the negatives arrived, they were sent to the developing machine. In just over three hours, the rushes were out. The last batch of negatives was sent to the developing and printing workshop on the morning of the 10th, and the staff immediately launched a crash developing and printing effort. As a result, before the director returned to the studio, the rushes were already waiting for him in the editing room.
    The film entered the final stages of production. Just as they were about to record the sound, they suddenly received news that Comrade Liú Zhìgāng, Secretary of the Yù County Party Committee, was leading representatives of recovered commune members to Beijing to thank the relevant units. The Party Committee instructed them to film it. The director immediately stopped the recording, and led the cameraman to capture this meeting filled with class friendship. Although it brought new difficulties to the film's production, and the structure of the film and the narration had to be greatly modified, everyone's enthusiasm soared. That night, a temporary recording was made. Xiǎo Chén from the production department rode his bicycle to find all the production staff and waited by the machines on standby. For a piece of music material, he rode his bicycle again to wake up the custodian from his dream and retrieve the material. Director Shí Lán and sound recordist Wáng Zhōngshàn directed the recording at the mixing console. Narration writer Shí Méi and narrator Liú Jiāyàn sat together, one revising and the other copying; revising a section, copying a section, recording a section. In this way, they revised, copied, and recorded all night long. As dawn broke, they walked out of the recording studio, stretched their limbs, and although they were physically tired, their spirits were even more full and vigorous.
    Now, the film "Class Brothers, Hearts Linked" has been released. The only thing we want to explain to the audience is: this film itself was also produced under the inspiration of the great communist spirit.

    “阶级兄弟心连心”抢拍记
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂　闽风　冀风
    3月5日下午三时三十分，我们厂接到关于河北蔚县有一百多名公社社员食物中毒，张家口市委打电话给北京特种药品经营部要求援助，现在准备马上空运药物的电话后，立即决定派两位摄影师随机抢拍。
    五点三十分，一架运输机从北京起飞了。这是民用航空公司北京管理局特派的送药专机。首都机场航行处副处长辛影同志随专机执行空投任务。起飞前，来不及给药箱绑灯、绑降落伞，起飞后才进行这些工作。摄影师陈凯初自知一上飞机就要呕吐，所以，找了个靠窗口的位置，坐着坚持拍摄空投准备工作。六时十二分，飞机到达蔚县上空。人们指着机身下边嚷道：“空投信号，信号，九堆火堆！白十字！”大家都准备起来。从机舱口望下去，隐隐约约还可以看到等候接药的人群。机务人员将药品投向白十字。
    就在同一个时间内，我们厂党委书记召集了紧急会议，决定另派摄影师星夜乘火车赴蔚县，把这一场抢救的战斗拍成纪录片。
    火车在黑夜里奔向张家口。车厢里，许多旅客们都鼾睡了，拍摄小队坐在车厢的一角，谁也不睡，谁也不说一句话，有时焦急地望望漆黑的窗外，听着单调的卡嚓卡嚓的火车的前进声。这一队踏上征途的人们，现在，都有着一个共同的信念：我们一定要纪录下这一场与死神搏斗的奇迹！这是共产主义思想的光辉！我们一定要全力把它抢拍下来！这是党给我们的光荣的职责！
    天刚蒙蒙亮，火车到达了张家口。摄影师们急忙赶到市委，正好市委负责同志和各公社的代表马上就要去八马坊慰问病员。于是，他们就马不停蹄地把汽车开往八马坊。在颠簸的汽车上，导演和摄影师共同研究，确定了拍摄提纲。到了八马坊，没等进村，就把机器架在村口，等候抢拍。
    抢救在进行，抢拍也在进行。对于参加这一战斗的每一个新闻纪录电影工作者来说，与其说是在工作，不如说是受了一次最深刻、最生动的共产主义教育。
    在党的关怀和各方的支持下，一百二十五个阶级兄弟的宝贵生命得救了！中毒最深的白玉一家四口人都得救了！白玉的妻子王玉先感动得热泪满眶，她说：“毛主席、共产党救了我一家人的命！”当中毒的人们听说是北京派飞机送来的药，个个都感动地说：“这是毛主席派神鹰给咱们送来的神药啊！”党的恩情真是千言万语也说不清。中毒的劳动模范李连有表示，决心搞好生产感谢党和毛主席。
    在厂里，战斗也在进行着。星期天中午，洗印工作间梁国柱接到通知：“阶级兄弟心连心”第一批底片已由蔚县发出。马上，他就来厂进行准备工作。底片一进厂，就送进了洗片机。仅仅三个多小时，样片就出来了。最后一批底片是10日早晨送到洗印工作间，洗印工作间职工马上突击洗印。结果，导演还未回厂，样片已经在剪接工作间等候着他了。
    影片进入最后的制作阶段。正要录音的时候，突然得到消息，说蔚县县委书记刘志刚同志带领病愈的社员代表来京向有关单位致谢。党委指示要拍。导演立即停止录音，带着摄影师抢拍下了这一段充满着阶级友情的会见；虽然它给影片的制作带来了新的困难，影片的结构、解说词要作很大的修改，但是大家干劲冲天。当夜临时录音，生产科小陈骑着自行车找齐了生产人员，就守在机器旁待命。为了一段音乐资料，他又蹬上自行车把保管员从梦中叫醒，找来资料。导演石岚和录音王忠善在调音台前指挥录音。解说词作者石梅和解说员刘家燕坐在一起，一个改，一个抄；改一段，抄一段，录一段。就这样，边改、边抄、边录，整整干了一夜。天大亮了，他们走出录音室，伸展了一下四肢，虽然身体有些疲乏，但精神却更加充沛、旺盛。
    现在，“阶级兄弟心连心”这部影片已经上映了。我们唯一想向观众说明的一点就是：这部影片本身，也是在伟大的共产主义精神感召下摄制出来的。
