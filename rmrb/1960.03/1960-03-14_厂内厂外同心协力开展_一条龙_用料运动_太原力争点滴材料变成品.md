According to Shanxi Daily News, Taiyuan City is comprehensively launching a "one-stop" material utilization campaign, striving to maximize the utilization rate of raw materials, minimize the consumption rate of raw materials, and fully comprehensively utilize waste materials. On this basis, the city is marching towards zero waste.

The "one-stop" material utilization campaign in this region mainly adopts three forms: First, it is the "one-stop" material utilization within enterprises. Under the premise of ensuring product quality, product parts are classified and queued, and methods such as using large materials first and small materials later, quota material requisition, nesting and cutting, and planned material dispensing are adopted to use whole materials for large jobs, and edge, surplus, waste, and scrap materials for small jobs. Even the small pieces that cannot be made into small parts are turned into useful materials through methods such as re-production through re-melting. Second, on the basis of promoting "one-stop" material utilization in various enterprises, the city then conducts comprehensive balance of raw materials. The edge and waste materials left over from large enterprises, which cannot be processed by the factory itself, are uniformly allocated by the city's "one-stop" material utilization office to small enterprises, light industry, street industry, and commune industry to increase the production of daily necessities urgently needed by the market. Third, comprehensive utilization of waste materials is carried out, and through the processing of waste materials, their quality is changed, making them useful or even substitutes for rare raw materials.

After a short period of more than a month, this campaign has achieved remarkable results. First, the utilization rate of raw materials has been greatly improved. According to preliminary statistics, the utilization rate of steel has increased from the 1959 general average of 70% to 80% to 85% in the city, and the most advanced units have reached more than 90%. Five waste-free units, such as Taiyuan Vehicle Repair Factory, Wood Factory, Leather Factory, Printing Factory, and Rubber Products Factory, have emerged. Secondly, it provides more sufficient raw materials for the production of daily necessities. Third, it has promoted the improvement of technical level and tapped the potential of waste materials. Taiyuan Wood Factory utilizes wood scraps and shavings to process and manufacture beautiful finished products such as sofas, chairs, and coffee tables. Finally, the sawdust is concentrated and processed into wood flour, which is supplied to units such as Taiyuan Plastic Factory and Jiangyang Chemical Factory to replace bakelite powder and other raw materials used in products. Fourth, the policy of "building the country diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily" has been further implemented. Fifth, the city-wide large-scale collaboration has been further strengthened, and the level of leading industrial production has been greatly improved. Due to the development of the regional raw material utilization "one-stop" campaign, the cooperation between enterprises in terms of raw materials is planned and arranged by the city in a unified manner on the basis of the masses' conscious effort, so the cooperation itself is more planned and unified. The city-level leaders have a clearer understanding of the use of raw materials on the city's industrial front, and are more active when arranging production and formulating and adjusting plans, and the plans are more advanced and practical.

    厂内厂外同心协力开展“一条龙”用料运动
    太原力争点滴材料变成品
    据山西日报消息　太原市全面开展原材料使用“一条龙”运动，力争把原材料利用率提高到最高程度，把原材料消耗率降低到最低限度，把废弃材料充分地加以综合利用，并在这个基础上，向全市无废料进军。
    这个地区原材料使用“一条龙”运动，主要采用了三种形式：第一种，是企业内部“一条龙”用料，在保证产品质量的前提下，对产品零件进行分类、排队，采用先大后小、限额领料、套裁下料、计划下料等方法，使整料作大活，边、余、废、下脚料作小活；连小零件也作不成的碎料，通过一锅铸再生产等方法，变成有用的材料。第二种，是在各企业推行“一条龙”用料的基础上，全市再进行原材料综合平衡。大企业剩余的边料、废料，本厂不能处理的，由市“一条龙”用料办公室统一调拨给小企业、轻工业、街道工业、公社工业，去增产市场急需的日用品。第三种，是对废料进行综合利用，通过对废料的加工，使之在质上发生变化，成为有用的，甚至是稀有原材料的代用品。
    这一运动经过短短一个多月时间，已获显著成果。首先是原材料利用率大大提高。初步统计，钢材利用率，全市已经从1959年总平均70％提高到80％至85％，最先进的单位达到90％以上，并且出现了太原车辆修造厂、木器厂、皮革厂、印刷厂、橡胶制品厂等五个无废料单位。其次，是为日用品生产提供了更充足的原料。第三，促进了技术水平的提高，发挥了废料的潜力。太原木器厂把碎木块、刨花都利用起来，加工制成美观的沙发、椅子、茶几等成品。最后，又把锯末子集中起来，加工成木粉，供给太原塑料厂、江阳化工厂等单位，代替电木粉及其他产品用的原料。第四，进一步贯彻执行了“勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业”的方针。第五，全市性的大协作进一步加强，领导工业生产的水平大大提高。由于开展地区原材料使用“一条龙”运动，使各企业间在原材料方面的协作，在群众自觉的基础上，作到由全市统一筹划、统一安排，所以协作本身更加强了计划性统一性。市级领导对全市工业战线使用原材料的情况，心中更加有数，在安排生产，制订、调整计划的时候，也更加主动，计划也更加先进和切合实际。
