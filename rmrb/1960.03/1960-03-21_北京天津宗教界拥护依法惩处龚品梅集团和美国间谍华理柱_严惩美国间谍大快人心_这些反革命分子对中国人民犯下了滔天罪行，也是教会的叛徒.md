Xinhua News Agency, March 20th—Religious figures in Beijing have held forums, unanimously supporting the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's verdicts on the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and American spy Hua Lizhu.

The Reverend Ma Wenchun, Director of the Beijing Catholic Patriotic Association, said, "The legal sanctions against the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group are not due to religious reasons, but because they have embarked on the path of betraying the motherland under the direction of American imperialism, and they have committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people." Li Yintao, the parish priest of the South Church in Beijing, said, "The verdicts in these two cases are a matter that gladdens the hearts of the people." The Beijing Catholic Patriotic Association issued a statement on the 19th, saying, "We must wholeheartedly participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and we must make the anti-imperialist patriotic movement widespread and in-depth, and wage unremitting struggle against the Vatican and all imperialists."

During the discussion meetings, Catholic clergy and laypeople believed that the Chinese Catholic Church must take the road of independence, autonomy, and self-management. Father Wang Shide said, "The revealed materials prove that these counter-revolutionary elements and spies have organized and planned serious criminal acts under the support and organization of American imperialism and the Vatican, and they are not ordinary crimes."

During the discussions, clergy and Catholic believers unanimously expressed that they would further raise their political awareness, stand firm on the people's position, and use practical actions of actively participating in socialist construction and the anti-imperialist patriotic movement to counter the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements and imperialism using the church to carry out sabotage activities against the motherland.

Venerable Yuanjue and the nuns of Tongjiao Temple said after a forum, "The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and American spies have committed serious crimes against the Chinese people, and it is very correct to impose legal sanctions, and we resolutely support it."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 20th—Religious figures in Tianjin held a forum on the 19th, unanimously supporting the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's just verdicts on the Gong Pinmei treasonous group and American spy Hua Lizhu.

The religious figures present expressed great indignation at the series of evil activities carried out by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and veteran American spy Hua Lizhu. Li Depei, Chairman of the Tianjin Catholic Patriotic Movement Promotion Association and Deputy Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese of the Catholic Church, said: The counter-revolutionary and espionage activities of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and American spy Hua Lizhu have been going on for a long time, and these people deserve to be punished by law. All our patriotic believers clearly recognize that the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court punished them not because they are Catholics, but because they are counter-revolutionary elements and international spies, which is a matter of eliminating enemies.

Zhang Jizhong, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Catholic Patriotic Movement Promotion Association and Deputy Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese of the Catholic Church, and Ma Guangpu, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Catholic Patriotic Movement Promotion Association and Deputy Bishop of the Xianxian Diocese, expressed their full support for the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's verdicts on the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and American spy Hua Lizhu in their speeches.

Liu Qingfen, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and others also believe that these two verdicts have severely打击美帝国主义的阴谋活动，打击了美帝国主义的阴谋活动were a major victory in the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle and a major victory in purifying religious organizations.

    北京市天主教友爱国会主任马文纯神甫说：“给龚品梅反革命叛国集团以国法制裁，并不是由于宗教的原因，而是因为他们受美帝国主义指使走上背叛祖国的道路，他们对中国人民犯下了滔天罪行。”天主教南堂本堂神甫李荫桃说：“这两个案件的判决是个大快人心的事情。”北京市天主教友爱国会在19日发表声明说：“我们要一心一意地参加祖国的社会主义建设，我们一定要使反帝爱国运动普遍深入开展，跟梵蒂冈和一切帝国主义者作不懈的斗争。”
    天主教神职人员和教徒群众在座谈讨论中，认为中国天主教会必须走独立自主自办教会的道路。神甫王师德说：“所揭发出的材料证明，这些反革命分子和间谍有组织、有计划的严重犯罪行为，是在美帝国主义和梵蒂冈的支持和组织下搞的，不是一般的罪行。”
    各教会神职人员和天主教徒在讨论中，一致表示要进一步提高自己的政治觉悟，站稳人民立场，用积极参加社会主义建设和反帝爱国运动的实际行动，来回击反革命分子和帝国主义利用教会对祖国进行阴谋破坏活动。
