Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 29th – In the year since the victory of the Cuban Revolution, national literature and art serving the revolution and the broad masses of the people have developed rapidly.

    In order to establish the country's own film industry, the Cuban Film School has been established. Cuban-produced documentaries such as "Our Land," "A Year of Freedom," "The July 26th Congress," "Agricultural Cooperatives," "The Rebel Army," and "Rural Housing" have been warmly welcomed by audiences. Currently, the large-scale film "History of the Revolution" is being filmed. The content of this film depicts the underground struggle and guerrilla warfare during the anti-Batista tyranny period.

    In the past year, Cuba has published many novels and plays describing the revolution, among which the most popular are José Pardo's novel "Memories of the Sierra Maestra" and José Soler's novel "Bertillon 166," which depicts the struggle of the heroic people of Santiago de Cuba against Batista. An opera based on peasant songs, reflecting the joy of peasants obtaining land and the determination to defend the revolution, has premiered in the capital. At the same time, Mirta Aguirre's play "José Antonio Ramos," which describes land reform, will be staged. In addition, the Cuban Navy premiered the poetic drama "Abdala" by Cuban national hero José Martí. Cuban ballet, which was on the verge of extinction under the tyranny, is being revived. The ballet "Awakening," which describes the struggle between the people and the oppressors, is currently in rehearsal. Black folk songs and dances performed at the National Theater are also popular with audiences.

    Painters recently held an art exhibition to raise funds for land reform. Murals with the themes of land reform, defending the revolution, and opposing intermediary exploitation have appeared on the walls of new rural residences and people's markets. Film teams and mobile picture exhibitions tour agricultural cooperatives to screen films and hold exhibitions for farmers.

    A discussion on the position of writers and artists in the revolution has unfolded in newspapers. Writer José Soler said that today, writers have no other path than to stand with the revolution. Their literature should serve the interests of the people, and if necessary, they should drop their pens and pick up their guns. He also said that writers should integrate with the people and not stand above them. Writers, actors, and musicians have joined militia organizations and are undergoing military training with workers and farmers.

    歌唱革命斗争　面向人民群众
    古巴民族文艺蓬勃发展
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　在古巴革命胜利后一年的时间中，为革命和广大人民群众服务的民族文学和艺术获得了迅速的发展。
    为了创办本国的电影事业，已经建立了古巴电影学校。古巴自己拍摄的纪录影片“我们的这块土地”、“自由的一年”、“七月二十六日大会”、“农业合作社”、“起义军”和“农村住宅”受到了观众的热烈欢迎。现在正在拍摄大型影片“革命史”。这部影片的内容是描写反巴蒂斯塔暴政时期的地下斗争和游击战争。
    一年来古巴出版了许多描写革命的小说和剧本，其中最受欢迎的有何塞·帕多的小说“马埃斯特腊山回忆录”和何塞·索莱尔的描写英雄的古巴圣地亚哥人民反对巴蒂斯塔斗争的小说“贝尔蒂利翁一六六”。首都已经公演了以农民的歌唱形式为基础的反映农民获得土地的欢乐和保卫革命决心的歌剧。同时还将上演米尔塔·阿吉雷的描写土地改革的话剧“何塞·安东尼奥·拉莫斯”。此外，古巴海军公演了古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂的诗剧“阿布达拉”。在暴政统治下奄奄一息的古巴芭蕾舞正在复兴。目前正在排演描写人民和压迫者的斗争的芭蕾舞“觉醒”。在国家剧院演出的黑人民间歌舞也受到观众的欢迎。
    画家们最近举行了一次为土地改革募捐的画展。以土地改革、保卫革命和反对中间人剥削为主题的壁画出现在农村新住宅和人民市场的墙壁上。电影队和流动图片展览在各农业合作社为农民巡回放映和展出。
    在报纸上展开了关于作家和艺术家在革命中的立场问题的讨论。作家何塞·索莱尔说，在今天，作家除了跟革命站在一起之外没有其他道路。他们的文学应该为人民的利益服务，如果需要的话，就应丢下笔杆拿起枪杆。他还说，作家应该与人民融和在一起。而不应该站在人民之上。作家、演员和音乐家参加了民兵组织，同工人、农民一起接受军事训练。
