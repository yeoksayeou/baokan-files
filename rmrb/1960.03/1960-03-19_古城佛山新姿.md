New Look of the Ancient City of Foshan

Older generations probably know that there is a town in Guangdong called Foshan, which has been one of China's four famous towns since ancient times, along with Hankou, Jingdezhen, and Zhuxian.

Historically, Foshan is indeed old. It has been a settlement since the Eastern Jin Dynasty, more than 1,500 years ago; from the Tang to the Song Dynasties, handicrafts flourished, and it gradually became an important town in the south, enjoying its reputation for about a thousand years.

Foshan Town is now called Foshan City.

Judging from the city's architecture and scale, apart from a few main roads and newly built houses, the small streets and alleys not only retain the ancient style, but also preserve the narrowness and the blindness of ancient city construction to a considerable extent. The urban area, which is not very large, originally had more than 1,300 streets and lanes. Even after these years of expansion and renovation, there are still more than 500, which gives an idea of its complexity. These small streets and lanes are winding, often with several entrances and exits. Some alleys look spacious, but are actually dead ends; at the end of some, a gate tower blocks the way, but passing through someone's front yard reveals a new scene. It is said that in the past, at the main intersections, there were people who acted as guides, sitting on small stools, waiting for people to ask them to lead them through the "maze" of winding alleys. This was indeed a rare and strange profession. Frankly speaking, it was necessary in those days, and even now, in some old alleys, one might not be able to get out smoothly after walking in.

The city's architecture was chaotic, and the sanitation was particularly poor. The ancient houses that had gone through vicissitudes, with dilapidated doors and windows, and black and mottled walls, looked like old people with wrinkles on their faces, relying on each other and looking at each other with sad faces. The ground was full of rubble and garbage. There were no facilities for draining sewage underground. Most residents dug deep pits in the patios or courtyards, or even in front of the gates, called "seepage wells," to pour water into them and let it slowly seep into the ground; since it was impossible to seep completely at once, they naturally became sewage pools, excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. Bluestone slabs covered the blocked ditches, and people would get mud on their feet if they weren't careful. Low-lying areas would flood during rain or high tides in the river, making it possible to travel by boat.

Such uncleanness naturally led to the prevalence of diseases, and superstition followed. Foshan has many small temples. Exaggeratedly speaking, almost every street has a variety of temples of different sizes. Stores selling superstitious items occupy an entire street.

I have spent a lot of ink describing the old appearance of the ancient city, with the aim of comparing it with today's new look.

Let's take a look at Foshan now.

Coming out of the railway station, there is a wide road built along the banks of the Fen River, dividing the road into two sides with several long flower beds. The side by the river is for pedestrians, and the other side is for vehicles. Many flowers and plants are planted in the flower beds. The most striking are the large, delicate Paris roses. The newly planted street trees, such as eucalyptus and phoenix trees, although not yet tall, will become lush and green screens in three to five years under the suitable southern climate. The banks of the Fen River are stone-paved, neat and solid, and the old look of collapsing soil is gone forever. To the north of the road, the past ruins and stinky ponds have disappeared, replaced by the newly built Yingbin Hotel, Exhibition Hall, and the courtyard-style artificial lake - Xiuli Lake. Just stepping into the gate of Foshan, the scene is fascinating. Further ahead, the four-kilometer-long urban road has shops next to each other. The road is wide, the surface is flat, and it is clean, without even a cigarette butt.

The main roads are clean, but they do not show the characteristics of the ancient city of Foshan. What is most admirable are the small streets and lanes. Walking into any small street or lane, even into a narrow lane that only allows one person to pass, the cleanliness, beauty, and tranquility cannot help but make you exclaim in surprise:
	"Ah! I really didn't expect it to be like this!"

The Chaoyang Street Residents' Committee in Foshan City has jurisdiction over several streets. Most of the houses here are old, and houses over a hundred years old are not uncommon; the terrain is low-lying, and in the past, residents of one street often argued with residents of another street because of sewage drainage problems; sometimes the water would flood, and they wouldn't dare to wear new shoes during the New Year; there were also many muddy areas and ruins, and garbage was right next to the houses. What about now? When you walk into the entrance of the street under the jurisdiction of this residents' committee, a road paved with "gray sand," smoother than asphalt, meanders through the streets and alleys, leading you into the depths, those depths that used to require a guide. At the entrance, there is a small garden, and around the corner, there are two more small gardens and a children's playground; further ahead, a small alley with one side neat and the other side curved. In the curved areas, people have built low brick walls to form "flower beds," planting flowers, making this originally deep and uneven alley suddenly become neat and bright. The walls are milky yellow, and the doors and windows are scrubbed clean. Ju'an Lane is the key street of this residents' committee. It is called the key because it was formerly known by the embarrassing nickname "Chicken Dung Lane," and now it attracts visitors as a model street for hygiene. Twenty-three households have been awarded the title of "Glorious Sanitary Home." This not-so-wide alley is bright, clean, spotless, with flower pots on the walls, filled with flowers, and mirror frames with folk songs written on them.

The sanitation work here does not stop on the streets. It also has strict requirements for the residents' indoor cleanliness. I visited many homes. I wiped and wiped the kitchen walls of some homes, and the black and shiny walls looked like they had been lacquered black, without a trace of dirt. Some particularly clean households even had no black ash on the bottom of their pots. They wash them immediately after use, so they always stay shiny.

Small gardens are another feature of the streets and alleys. Didn't I say that there are many ruins and muddy areas here? Small gardens are built in these places, which can both beautify and eradicate garbage dumps. An old, crowded house with a small garden in the middle is like opening a window in a tightly sealed room, making people feel comfortable. Small gardens are collectively enjoyed and collectively managed. The flowerpots are collected by everyone, in various styles, put together, colorful, and quite beautiful. Some families sent out green glazed "stone drums," and others moved out rockeries. There are hundreds of small gardens in Foshan City, and I have not seen any design that is the same. There are talented people among the masses who design various suitable and beautiful gardens according to the terrain. Some streets have built "flower beds," and the houses seem to grow out of the flowers. The Ma Temple Residents' Committee has built 500 meters of "flower beds" and 100 "flower piers." Muddy areas have not only been turned into gardens (gardens can also produce, for example, the income from roses is considerable), but also used to grow vegetables and engage in sideline production.

Foshan was formerly a city with developed handicrafts, and its silk weaving, casting, and ceramics have long been famous. However, the production at that time was small and dispersed, with handicraft workshops everywhere. The workers' working conditions were extremely bad. Taking silk weaving as an example, the fragrant cloud gauze produced in Foshan was already famous in the Southern Song Dynasty, but the primitive method of independent production by one person on a wooden machine was retained until before and after liberation. In those days, walking in the streets and alleys, the sound of hammering iron and the sound of looms intertwined. Now, several large-scale silk weaving factories have been established, modern silk weaving factories have been put into production, wooden machines are gradually being replaced by electric machines, and are developing towards automation. Scattered workers from each household have moved into bright and tall workshops.

The outstanding achievement of Foshan's urban transformation work is of course reflected in the city's sanitation work. However, there is also a relationship between the base and the superstructure here. If people are worried about their livelihood every day, who would have the mind to think about sanitation and beautifying the environment? The employment situation in Foshan is very good. Residents with labor and who can participate in labor have almost all found work. This is the most important key and the most central link in transforming the city. But with this, if there is a lack of planned leadership and ideological mobilization, the city's sanitation work may not be done well. It is very likely that such a phenomenon will occur: residents have made their families beautiful, and they may not be so enthusiastic about public places. Furthermore, mobilizing residents to sweep the streets and clean up garbage, but lacking a longer-term plan, unclogged sewers, and unrenovated roads, will make it difficult for the masses' enthusiasm to last. There is such an example, He Lin, a resident of No. 6 Hong'an Lane, had a "seepage well" in front of his house that had not been renovated in the past. He was very indifferent when asked to come out to do cleaning, but now that the entire alley has been renovated, he comes out to clean even late at night.

The transformation of the ancient city of Foshan started with the development of production. In the early days of liberation, Foshan's output value was only 20 million yuan, but in 1959 it reached more than 130 million yuan, an increase of five and a half times. This year, it is expected to increase by 50% compared with last year. Sanitation work was launched on this basis. In 1958, it started with the fundamental treatment of sewers, deepening and improving step by step. The professional staff initially estimated that it would cost 1.3 million yuan and take five years to complete the more than 80,000 meters of sewers, but after launching a large-scale mass movement, it only cost more than 100,000 yuan and took 60 days to complete all the repairs. In the process of repairing, the masses were educated and talents were cultivated. Then, fighting slogans such as leveling roads, transforming toilets (now all changed to flush toilets), and eliminating epidemics were put forward. In the past two years, the entire city has undergone tremendous changes. The people's thoughts and feelings have also changed along with it. Now, hygiene has become a habit here. One resident said: "I am not happy if I don't clean." A child refuses to eat vegetables without using public chopsticks... These are still general changes. The profound change lies in the strengthening of the collective concept, and the idea of ​​"everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door" is slowly being replaced by the idea of ​​"taking care of the frost on other people's tiles."

With the popularization of sanitation work, it is necessary to consider improvement. Some residents' committees have opened amateur hygiene schools. Classes are held two nights a week, and the courses include: several common infectious diseases, acupuncture for common general diseases, maternal and child health, practice, etc. After graduating in nine weeks, they can have preliminary nursing knowledge, which is of great benefit to the consolidation of sanitation work.

Since the streets and alleys have become the big family of the residents, the phenomenon that neighbors have not greeted each other for more than ten years has of course disappeared, and public canteens, nurseries, sideline production, etc., have further organized and united them. I saw that some residents' committees have opened service stations with many service items. In addition to providing moving services and repairing houses, they also provide medicine decoction, soup stewing, care for mothers and patients, and wedding arrangements, which socializes household labor and greatly promotes the collectivization of urban residents' lives.

The ancient city is changing!

Foshan is only one of the many ancient cities in our country, and its changes are gratifying. Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people can overcome all difficulties and create miracles. The changes in Foshan prove this once again. (Picture attached)

专栏：

    古城佛山新姿
    老一辈的人，大概都知道广东有个佛山镇，自古以来，它就是中国四大名镇中的一个，和汉口镇、景德镇、朱仙镇齐名。
    论历史，佛山的确算得上古老。自东晋形成聚落，至今已有一千五百多年；自唐至宋，手工业勃兴，逐渐成为南方的重镇，享有龄誉也在千年左右。
    佛山镇，现在叫佛山市。
    从城市的建筑和规模来看，除了几条干道和新建的房屋之外，小街小巷，不仅饶有古风，还在相当程度上保存着古代城市的湫隘和建设的盲目性，面积不算太大的城区，原有一千三百多条街巷，就是经过这些年来的扩建和改造之后，仍然有五百多条，可以想见它的繁琐。这些小街小巷，九曲十三弯，常常有几个进出口。有些巷看上去很宽敞，实际是个死胡同；有的尽头，一堵门楼挡住去处，可是穿过人家的前庭，却又是一番景色。据说，以前在主要路口，有种当向导的人，坐在小凳子上，等人们去请他，他带你穿行在“八卦阵”似的曲巷中。这真是一种罕见的奇怪的职业。老实说，在当年有此需要，就是现在，在某些旧巷中，一个人走进去，也未必能顺利地走出来。
    城市的建筑，固然杂乱无章，而卫生情况尤其不佳。历尽沧桑的古屋，门窗破旧，墙壁乌黑而斑剥，好像是一些脸上布满皱纹的老人，愁眉苦脸地互相依靠着、对望着。地面多瓦砾堆、垃圾堆。地下没有疏泄污水的设备，多数居民在天井里或院子里，甚至在大门前，掘个深坑，叫做“渗井”，把水倒进去，让它慢慢渗透到地里；一时不可能渗透干净，自然成了污水池，蚊蝇绝好的孳生地。麻石板盖在淤塞的沟渠上，人们走过，一不小心，污泥会漫到脚面。低洼的地方，遇到下雨或河里水涨，汪洋一片，可以行船。
    这样的不清洁，疾病自然流行，迷信便跟着产生，人们向渺茫的神灵，伸出绝望的双手。佛山多小庙，夸张点说，几乎每一条街上，都有一座各式各样大小不同的庙宇。售卖迷信用品的商店，占据整整一条大街。
    我费了很多笔墨来描写古城的旧貌，目的是拿它来和今天的新姿作个对比。
    让我们来看看现在的佛山吧。
    从火车站出来，是一条沿着汾河岸边修成的宽阔马路，用若干个长形的花坛，把马路分成两边，靠河的一边是行人道，另一边走车辆。花坛中种了许多花草，最引人注意的是大朵的娇艳的巴黎玫瑰。新植的街道树，如桉树、凤凰树，虽然还不太高大，但在南方适宜的气候下，三、五年之后，将会枝繁叶茂，成为绿荫屏风。汾河堤岸是石砌的，整齐坚固，当年泥土崩溃的旧观，一去不复返。在马路的北边，过去的废墟臭水塘不见了，代替它的是新建的迎宾馆、展览馆和有庭院风味的人工湖——秀丽湖。刚刚踏入佛山的大门口，扑面而来的景象便使人神往。再往前走，长达四公里的市区马路，商店一间挨着一间，道路宽，路面平，干干净净，连一个香烟头也找不到。
    大马路是整洁的，但是，显不出佛山古城的特点，最使人赞叹的还是那些小街小巷。随便走进哪条小街小巷，哪怕是走进狭窄得仅容一人通过的小巷，那种洁净、美观和安静，不由你不发出惊讶的呼声：
      “呵！真想不到是这样的！”
    佛山市朝阳街居民委员会，管辖有几条街道。这里的房屋多是古老的，百年以上的房屋也不算罕见；地势低洼，过去常常因为排污水的问题，这一条街的居民和另一条街的居民吵架；有时水淹，过年过节也不敢穿新鞋子；烂泥地和废墟也很多，垃圾就在住宅旁边。现在呢？当你走进这个居民委员会管辖的街道进口，一条“灰砂”铺成的道路，比柏油路还要光滑，蜿蜒在街巷，把你引进深处，那些过去需要向导的深处。入口处有一座小花园，拐过弯去，又是两座小花园和一间儿童游乐场；再往前走，一条一边整齐而另一边有弯曲的小巷，人们在弯曲的地方，砌上矮砖墙，筑成“花基”，种了鲜花，使这条本来幽深而不整齐的小巷，顿时变得整齐而明媚起来。墙壁是奶黄色的，门窗洗刷得很光亮。居安里是这个居民委员会的重点街道。说它是重点，因为过去以“鸡屎巷”这个难堪的绰号闻名，而现在以卫生模范街吸引了参观者。二十三户人家，有二十一户得到“光荣卫生之家”的称号。这条并不宽敞的小巷，明亮，干净，地上一尘不染，墙壁上有花插，插着鲜花，挂着写有民歌的镜架。
    这里的卫生工作，并不停留在街道上，它对居民的室内清洁工作，要求也是很严的。我参观了许多人家。我曾在一些人家的厨房墙壁上抹了又抹，乌黑油光的墙壁，简直像黑漆漆过似的，没有一点污迹。有些特别清洁的住户，连锅底也没有黑灰。他们用过之后，马上就洗，因而始终保持光亮。
    小花园，是街巷的另一特点。我不是说过这里的废墟烂泥地较多吗？就在这些地方，盖个小花园，既可以美化，又可以根除垃圾堆。古老的挤在一起的房屋，中间有一个小花园，好像密不通风的房间突然打开了窗户，使人心情舒畅起来。小花园是集体享受、集体经营的。花盆是大家凑起来的，各式各样，合在一起，万紫千红，相当好看。有的人家送出绿釉的“石鼓”，有的人家搬出假山石。佛山市有几百处小花园，我还没有看到有一处的设计是相同的。群众中有能人，他们按照地形，设计出各种适当而又美观的花园。有些街道砌了“花基”，房屋似乎从花丛中生长了出来。妈庙居民委员会就砌了五百米长的“花基”，一百个“花墩”。烂泥地不仅变成花园（花园也可以生产，例如玫瑰花的收入就很可观），也有利用来种菜，搞副业的。
    佛山，过去是手工业发达的城市，丝织、铸造、陶瓷，享盛名已久。但是，当时的生产，规模小而分散，到处是手工业作坊。工人的劳动条件坏极了。以丝织为例，佛山出产的香云纱，在南宋时已经出名，但是一架木机，一个人独立生产的原始方式，一直保留到解放前后。当年走在街巷中，敲打铁器的声音，机柕的声音，交织成一片。现在，几间规模很大的丝织厂建立了，现代化的丝织厂已投入生产，木机逐渐给电机代替，正向自动化发展。一家一户的分散的工人，搬进了明亮的高大的车间。
    佛山的城市改造工作，突出的成绩，当然表现在城市卫生工作上。可是，这里面也有个基础和上层建筑的关系。人们若是天天为生活担忧，谁有心思去想到卫生，想到美化环境？佛山的就业情况是很好的，居民有劳动力而又能参加劳动的，几乎都有了工作。这是改造城市的最主要的关键，最中心的环节。但是有了这一条，若缺少有计划的领导和思想发动，城市卫生工作未必搞得好。很可能出现这样的现象：居民们把自己的家庭搞得漂亮了，对公共场所不一定那么热心。再说，把居民调动起来，扫扫街，清清垃圾，但缺少较远大的计划，下水道不畅通，道路不整治，群众的热情也难于持久。有这样的例子，洪安里六号的居民何林，家门前有一口“渗井”，过去未加整治，要他出来搞清洁，他就很冷淡，现在把整条巷子翻修了，他深夜也出来打扫。
    古城佛山的改造，首先是从发展生产入手的。解放初期，佛山的产值只有二千万元，1959年达到一亿三千多万元，增长五倍半，今年预计比去年提高50％。卫生工作就在这样的基础上展开。1958年，从根治下水道开始，一步一步地深入和提高。八万多米长的下水道，最初专业人员估计，要花一百三十万元，五年时间才能完成，但大搞群众运动之后，只花了十几万元，六十天时间，全部修好了。在修治过程中，教育了群众，也培养了人材。跟着提出平整道路，改造厕所（现在全部改为水厕），消灭流行病等战斗口号。两年来，整个城市面貌，有了极大的变化。人民的思想感情，也随同有了变化。现在，卫生成了这里的习惯，一个居民说：“不打扫不安乐。”一个小孩子不用公筷就不肯吃菜，……这些，还是一般的变化。深刻的变化，在于集体观念加强，“各人自扫门前雪”的思想，慢慢地要为“要管他人瓦上霜”的思想代替了。
    卫生工作普及了，就要考虑提高。有些居民委员会开办了业余卫生学校。每周上课两晚，学习课程有：常见的几种传染病，常见一般疾病的针灸，妇幼卫生，实习等等。九个星期毕业之后，是可以具有初步护理常识的，这对卫生工作的巩固，大有好处。
    街巷既已成为居民的大家庭，过去邻居十多年不招呼的现象，当然消失了，而公共食堂，托儿所，搞副业生产等等，又使他们进一步地组织、团结起来。我看到有些居民委员会，开办了服务站，服务项目很多，除了代办搬运，代办修整房屋之外，还代煎药、炖汤，代照顾产妇、病人，代办婚礼，这就使家务劳动社会化，大大促进城市居民生活的集体化。
    古城在变化中！
    佛山，只是我国许多古老城市中的一个，它的变化是令人欣喜的。中国人民在党的领导下，可以战胜一切困难，创造奇迹，从佛山的变化，又一次得到证明。（附图片）
    解放前被称为“鸡屎巷”的居安里，现在变得清洁美观。
