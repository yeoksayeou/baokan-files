	Heroic "Two Generations"
	——Review of the Urumqi Railway Bureau Song and Dance Troupe's Opera "Two Generations"
	Ye Lin

	After seeing the opera "Two Generations" performed in the capital by the Urumqi Railway Bureau Song and Dance Troupe of the Ministry of Railways, I have been unable to calm down for several days. It is exciting and thought-provoking. It should be said that being able to express such a profound theme in an opera, and to be so moving in terms of art, especially in the shaping of proletarian heroes, this is one of the better ones since operas such as "The White Haired Girl" and "Liu Hulan."

	This opera uses the separation and reunion of an excellent Han Chinese female Communist Party member and her son in the revolutionary struggle as a thread, running through the new and old eras of Xinjiang. It expresses the fighting friendship cemented in blood by the Uygur and Han peoples in the class struggle, as well as the growth of the people of these two eras in the tempering of class struggle, and enthusiastically praises the unity of the Uygur and Han nationalities. Its theme is profound and clear; its subject matter is real and moving.

	The most valuable aspect of this opera is that it very firmly and powerfully illustrates the correct view of class relations and ethnic relations through artistic images. In the old society, during the years of the reactionary rule of the Sheng Shicai bandit gang, the class struggle had already inextricably united the Uygur and Han peoples. Many of our most outstanding Han Chinese Communist Party members fought alongside the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for the liberation of Xinjiang, and sacrificed their lives in the class struggle; and the Uygur people also regarded their Han Chinese class brothers as their own flesh and blood in the struggle. The play depicts that after the Communist Party member Zhao Bin was sacrificed, when his wife and infant under one year old were threatened with death, the Uygur people, Asim, risked their lives to rescue the baby, wandering bitterly for seventeen years, raising the child, making him become an advanced element in socialist construction, and finally reuniting with his heroic mother. This point has very powerfully illustrated that Asim's raising of this child is not just ethnic sentiment, but more importantly, class sentiment; illustrating that consistent class interests can unite and form a flesh-and-blood relationship, and that this kind of unity cannot be destroyed by any force. It seems that the best part of this opera is precisely this point.

	From here, it also vividly illustrates that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, in the history of their own liberation, began under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. More than twenty years ago, when the War of Resistance Against Japan began and our Party was still in a very difficult period, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were constantly concerned about the liberation cause of all ethnic groups in our country, and sent a large number of outstanding Party members, such as Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, and Lin Jilu, to work in Xinjiang, sowing the revolutionary seeds of communism. Although many comrades were murdered after Sheng Shicai's bandit gang strangled the revolution, and Xinjiang returned to bloody terrorist rule, the martyrs' blood was not shed in vain, and their heroic deeds will always be the revolutionary inspiration of the people of Xinjiang. The experience of the two Communist Party members Zhao Bin and Li Hua, this couple, very truly reflects the era of that struggle at the time, embodying and recording the unforgettable struggle history of the Communist Party members who worked in Xinjiang at that time.

	After liberation, in the process of socialist construction, the class struggle has not ended. The older and younger generations continue to engage in class struggle together, and are tempered and grow in the struggle; the people of all ethnic groups also continue to achieve further unity in the struggle. This idea is also well reflected in the opera. When the Party wanted to bring socialist happiness and prosperity to Xinjiang through the railway, new contradictions and struggles appeared. Li Hua and her son, these two generations, fought against local nationalist elements together with the broad masses of Uygur people, and reunited in the struggle, embodying the flesh-and-blood unity of the Uygur and Han peoples.

	In an opera, being able to thread such an idea through two generations, writing from the historical development to today, displaying the political foundation of the unity of all ethnic groups, and illustrating that under the leadership of the Party, this kind of class-brotherly unity has historical ties. This kind of courage cannot be considered anything less than extremely grand. It seems that this opera itself is also a powerful weapon against local nationalism. Local nationalist elements have two tricks: creating ethnic divisions and not acknowledging the leadership of the Party. In this opera, both are refuted completely. It uses ironclad facts to illustrate the friendship and unity of the Uygur and Han peoples, which have grown up in the class struggle, from the historical development. This undoubtedly has extremely profound educational significance for the working people of today.

	This opera also has many brilliant points in its plot, structure arrangement, and character portrayal. It focuses on the present, on the new changes and new life of the Uygur people after liberation, and on two generations who are working selflessly and struggling for the construction of socialism. The past is only narrated in one scene; the author uses few strokes, but very powerfully outlines the moving scene of revolutionary struggle in that dark era of the past in this scene. And makes it have a close connection with the development of the entire plot, increasing the ideological depth of the whole play. The portrayal of the characters in the play is also relatively good. The Communist Party members Zhao Bin and Li Hua are both relatively realistic and have full images. Li Hua's activities as the Party Secretary after liberation are particularly well written. She cherishes new things and adheres to the mass line; she has a keen sense of class, has both a sense of the enemy's situation, and is caring for and kind to the Uygur working people as if they were her own flesh and blood; she works diligently, adheres to principles in everything, and consistently puts the interests of the Party above everything else. These many excellent qualities are well embodied in her, shaping a vivid image of the older generation of revolutionaries. As for the image of the Uygur elder Asim, it is even more complete and unforgettable. For the sake of the descendants of the revolution, and to be faithful to his class feelings, for seventeen years, he named Li Hua's son Ayijiang and raised him as his own grandson, embodying the flesh-and-blood relationship formed by the two peoples in the class struggle. In the play, every move of Asim, this Uygur elder who has experienced much and has a heart full of thoughts, is moving. He pours all his class feelings and national feelings into Ayijiang (the Uygur woman Alamuhan, who was once in the same prison as Li Hua, is also like this). He also puts all his revolutionary enthusiasm into the construction of the new society. From this character, we seem to feel the beating hearts of the entire Uygur people.

	The music of this opera is also very well written, with a very distinct Uygur musical style, and it is also very unified from beginning to end. Before entering the theater, there seemed to be a concern: how should the musical style be handled in an opera that writes about two ethnic groups? Now it seems that this worry is superfluous. Since it is writing about the specific environment of the Uygur ethnic group and the story in the Uygur region, it is completely appropriate to unify on the keynote of Uygur music; since the Han Chinese revolutionary workers are working in the Uygur-speaking area, it is also very natural to sing in Uygur tunes, and it also helps the theme of ethnic unity. Of course, this is not to say that the tone style is placed above everything else, it is still subordinate to the needs of the drama characters and developed accordingly. When the Han Chinese revolutionary workers recall the battle songs they sang when they left Yan'an, this battle song with a strong style of the War of Resistance Against Japan not only did not produce an uncoordinated feeling, but was even more intimate in terms of emotion.

	The Urumqi Railway Bureau Song and Dance Troupe has only been working in Xinjiang for more than two years, and it has created such a meaningful opera, which is a great achievement. And the guidance and specific assistance from the Party committees at all levels in Xinjiang on creation is even more of a decisive factor. In the process of creation and revision of the script, the leading comrades of the Party and government of the Autonomous Region, the Party committee of the Railway Bureau, the Autonomous Region Drama Association, and the Music Association all enthusiastically gave specific guidance. Comrades who had experienced this revolutionary historical struggle also led them to see the remaining prison site, introduced many situations at the time, and provided rich materials. The emergence of this script embodies the correct experience of the combination of experts and the masses under the leadership of the Party. As the author Comrade Liu Zhen said, the entire process of creation and revision of the play is precisely a process of gradually understanding the Party's instructions and intentions, and also a process of gradually improving understanding and transforming thinking; without the leadership of the Party, there would be no emergence of this script.

	It is said that this opera has been revised five times and is currently being continuously revised. Nowadays, there may still be some problems that have not been satisfactorily resolved. For example, the portrayal of the older generation is relatively powerful, while the portrayal of the new generation is relatively inferior; especially the aspect of opposing local nationalist elements is relatively vague. The character of Li Hua, this hero, is not very consistent before and after. For example, in the prison struggle scene, perhaps because in addition to the class struggle, there are also contradictions of life and death of flesh and blood, the mood is more complicated, so she considers the latter more, and is somewhat weak. In addition, there are some small places in the plot that are not arranged very reasonably, and so on. We believe that as long as we firmly rely on the leadership of the Party and give full play to collective wisdom, we will definitely be able to get better solutions in future revisions. Make it become an excellent epic that expresses the flesh-and-blood unity of the Uygur and Han peoples.

    英雄的“两代人”
    ——评乌鲁木齐铁路局文工团歌剧“两代人”
    叶林
    看到了铁道部乌鲁木齐铁路局文工团在首都上演的歌剧“两代人”以后，好几天以来，心里一直不能平静。它使人激动，引人思索。应该说，在歌剧中能够表现出如此深刻的主题思想，在艺术上特别是在无产阶级英雄人物的塑造上又能够如此地打动人心的，自“白毛女”、“刘胡兰”等歌剧以来，这也是其中较好的一部。
    这部歌剧以一个优秀的汉族女共产党员和她的儿子在革命斗争中的离合为线索，贯串了新疆的新旧两个时代，表现了维、汉两族人民在阶级斗争中用鲜血凝成的战斗友情，以及这两个时代的人民在阶级斗争的锻炼中的成长，热情地歌颂了维、汉两民族的团结。它的主题是深刻的、鲜明的；它的题材是真实的、动人的。
    这部歌剧的最可贵之处，就是非常坚定而有力地通过艺术形象，生动地说明了阶级关系和民族关系的正确看法。在旧社会中，在盛世才匪帮反动统治的年代，阶级斗争就已经把维、汉两族人民牢不可破地团结在一起了。我们许多最优秀的汉族共产党员就曾经为了新疆各族人民的解放而和新疆各族人民在一起进行斗争，并且在阶级斗争中付出了生命；而维族人民也在斗争中把自己的汉族阶级兄弟视如手足。剧中写到共产党员赵彬牺牲以后，他的妻子和不满周岁的婴儿受到生命威胁的时候，维族人民阿西姆冒死把婴儿救出，含苦茹辛地流浪了十七年，把孩子抚养大了，成为社会主义建设的先进分子，最后和他的英雄母亲团聚。这一点已经非常有力地说明了阿西姆抚养这个孩子不只是民族感情，更重要的是阶级感情；说明了阶级利益一致就能团结，就能结成血肉的关系，这种团结是任何力量不能破坏的。这部歌剧着墨最好之处，看来也正是这个地方。
    从这里还生动地说明了新疆各族人民在解放自己的历史上，一开始就是在中国共产党的领导下进行的。二十多年以前，在抗日战争开始，我们的党还处在非常艰苦的年代里，党中央和毛主席就无时无刻不在关怀着我国各族人民的解放事业，派出了陈潭秋、毛泽民、林基路等一大批优秀的党员，前往新疆工作，播下了共产主义的革命火种。虽然在盛世才匪帮扼杀革命后，不少同志被害，新疆又回到了血腥的恐怖统治中，但是烈士们的鲜血没有白流，他们的英雄事迹永远成为新疆人民的革命鼓舞力量。剧中的两个共产党员赵彬和李华这对夫妇的遭遇，就十分真实地反映了当时的那个斗争的年代，体现和纪录了当时在新疆工作的共产党人的坚贞不屈的永远难忘的斗争历史。
    解放以后，在社会主义建设过程中，阶级斗争并没有终止。年长的和年青的一代在一起继续进行着阶级斗争，并且在斗争中得到锻炼、成长；各族人民也在斗争中继续取得进一步的团结。这种思想在歌剧中也有了很好的体现，当党要将社会主义的幸福与繁荣通过铁路带向新疆的时候，新的矛盾和斗争出现了，李华母子这两代人都和广大维族人民在一起对地方民族主义分子进行了斗争，并且在斗争中重逢，体现了维、汉两族人民骨肉般的团结。
    在一部歌剧中，能够把这样的思想贯串在两代人的身上，从历史的发展写到今天，展示了各族人民团结的政治基础，说明了在党的领导下，这种阶级兄弟般的团结有着历史上的血缘。这种魄力不能不算是十分宏大的。看来，这部歌剧本身也是反对地方民族主义的有力武器。地方民族主义分子有两个手法：制造民族隔阂，不承认党的领导，在这部歌剧中都被驳斥得体无完肤了。它用铁一般的事实从历史的发展中说明了维、汉两族人民在阶级斗争中成长起来的友谊与团结。这对今天的劳动人民来说，无疑地有着极其深刻的教育意义。
    这部歌剧在情节、结构安排和在人物的塑造上，也有许多精采之处。它着力写的是今天，是维族人民在解放后的新变化、新生活，是两代人都在为建设社会主义而忘我劳动、进行斗争。关于过去，只在一场戏中倒叙；作者用笔不多，却很有分量地在这一场戏中勾划出了过去那个黑暗时代革命斗争的动人情景。并且使它和整个剧情的发展有着密切的联系，使全剧增加了思想的深度。关于剧中人物的刻划，也是比较好的。共产党员赵彬和李华都比较真实，形象丰满。李华在解放后作为党委书记的活动写得尤其出色，她爱护新生事物，坚持群众路线；她有敏锐的阶级感，既有敌情观念，又对维族劳动人民爱护备至、亲如手足；她勤勤恳恳地工作，遇事坚持原则，一贯把党的利益放在一切之上。这许多优秀的品质，在她的身上都有较好的体现，塑造了老一辈革命家的生动形象。至于维族老人阿西姆的形象，那更是完整，令人难忘。他为了革命的后裔，为了忠实于自己的阶级感情，十七年来，把李华的儿子取名为艾衣江，当作自己的孙子抚养成人，体现了两族人民在阶级斗争中结成的骨肉关系。在剧中，阿西姆这个饱经锻炼、有着满怀心事的维族老人的一举一动都是感动人的，他把全部的阶级感情和民族感情都倾注在艾衣江的身上（曾经和李华同牢的维族妇女阿拉木汗阿姨也是如此）。他还把全部的革命热情放在新社会的建设事业上。从这个人物的身上，我们仿佛感觉到了整个维族人民跳动着的心。
    这部歌剧的音乐也写得很好，有着很鲜明的维族音乐的风格，前后也很统一。在走进剧场以前，似乎有这样一种顾虑：在一部歌剧中写两个民族，它的音乐风格应该如何处理？现在看来，这种担心是多余的。它既然是写维吾尔族的特定环境和在维族地区的故事，统一在维族音乐的基调上是完全合适的；汉族革命工作者既然在维语地区工作，用维族音调演唱也是很自然的事，而且有助于民族团结的主题。当然，这也不是说把音调风格摆在一切之上，它还是服从于戏剧人物的需要而发展的。当汉族的革命工作者，回忆着离别延安时所唱的战歌时，这一首带有浓郁抗战歌曲风格的战歌，不仅没有产生不调和的感觉，而是在感情上愈感亲切。
    乌鲁木齐铁路局文工团到新疆工作才不过两年多，就创造出这样一部有意义的歌剧，成绩是很大的。而新疆各级党委对创作上的指导和具体帮助，更是其中带有决定性的因素。剧本在创作和修改过程中，自治区党政领导同志、铁路局党委、自治区剧协、音协都热情地加以具体指导。曾经经历过这个革命历史斗争的同志还领他们去看了残存的监狱旧址，介绍了许多当时的情况，提供了丰富的材料。这个剧本的产生，体现了在党的领导下、专家与群众结合的正确经验。正如作者刘镇同志所说的，整个戏的创作和修改过程，正是逐步明确领会党的指示和意图的过程，也是逐步提高认识、改造思想的过程；没有党的领导，也就没有这个剧本的产生。
    据说，这部歌剧已经修改了五遍，目前还在不断修改之中。如今，可能还存在一些问题没有得到称心的解决。如对老一代人的刻划比较有力，对新一代的刻划比较逊色；特别是反对地方民族主义分子的这一方面比较模糊。李华这个英雄人物的性格前后还不是很统一，如在牢狱斗争这一场，可能是因为除了阶级斗争以外还存在着骨肉生离死别的矛盾，心境比较复杂，因而对后者考虑得多了一些，稍嫌软弱。此外，在情节上有一些小地方还不是安排得很合理等等。我们相信，只要坚决依靠党的领导，充分发挥集体智慧，一定可以在今后的修改中得到更好的解决。使它成为表现维、汉两族人民骨肉般团结的优秀史诗。
