From our newspaper in Lüda, March 28th. Workers in many factories and enterprises in Lüda are actively carrying out comprehensive coal utilization during the technical innovation movement, recovering and processing more than twenty kinds of products such as fertilizer, diesel, gasoline, plastics, carbon black, benzol, phenol, and germanium from coal.

Lüda's industrial sector uses a large amount of coal, but in the past, most of the coal was burned directly, and all the by-products in the coal were wasted. In 1958, while vigorously saving coal, the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China required Party committees at all levels to vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of coal. Many factory and enterprise workers adopted methods of reforming existing equipment and adding some auxiliary equipment to quickly expand the quantity and variety of coal by-products recovered. In addition to using coal as a raw material to manufacture fertilizer, sulfuric acid and other seven major products, the workers of Dalian Chemical Plant added a set of old distillation and condensation equipment last year, which can recover a large amount of benzol and pyridine every day; after adding some equipment, semiconductor raw materials were recovered from flue ash. Now, the factory is expanding coal tar processing equipment to increase the recovery of twelve products including heavy and medium oil, benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenol, and asphalt. Workers at the Dalian Gas Company used old equipment and added some new equipment to expand from recovering two by-products to recovering thirteen products, which can create an additional 5.7 million yuan of wealth for the country every year. Only one set of tar processing equipment converted from two old kettles can process nearly ten products such as anthracene, anticorrosive oil, phenol, and gasoline. Last year, a semi-native and semi-foreign carbon black workshop of this company produced 593 tons of carbon black, which was sold to Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places. Dalian Steel Plant, Dalian Insulator Factory, Jinzhou Heavy Machinery Plant and other units have built and are building a total of ten mixed gas generators with a daily output of 13 cubic meters of gas, which can not only increase the thermal efficiency utilization rate, but also recover coal tar. Because the use of gas is easier to control temperature than coal, it is of great benefit to improving product quality and improving workers' working conditions.

Many factories and enterprises have also adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods to establish a large number of Red Flag simple coking furnaces and small gas generators. Only the more than a dozen Red Flag simple coking furnaces built by several factories under the Lüda Heavy Industry Bureau last year not only produced more than 27,000 tons of metallurgical coke to supply the city's small blast furnaces for production, but also recovered more than 680 tons of coal tar. A simple gas plant built by Dalian Gas Company in Jinzhou Town produces 11 tons of metallurgical coke, 400 kilograms of coal tar, and 4,500 cubic meters of gas every day, which is used by 150 households nearby for cooking and heating. More than 30 square furnaces with a capacity of 15 tons have also been built in the city. Each furnace can produce 10 tons of metallurgical coke and 1.5 tons of coal tar at a time, producing more than 10,000 cubic meters of gas.

Many factories and enterprises in the city have also cooperated with scientific institutions and universities to carry out research on new technologies for comprehensive coal utilization. With the assistance of personnel from the Coal Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian No. 1 Power Plant, Dalian Gas Company, and Dalian Chemical Plant extracted semiconductor raw materials from flue ash. Technicians from Dalian Institute of Technology and the Coal Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are working with workers from Dalian No. 1 Power Plant to jointly test the cutting-edge technology of "pre-furnace dry distillation." Lüda is building a coal tar processing plant with an annual processing capacity of 20,000 tons and two slag brick factories using coal slag to meet the needs of various factories for recovering coal by-products.

    充分利用现有设备　扩大煤炭综合利用
    旅大千方百计向“乌金”取宝
    本报旅大28日电　旅大市许多工厂企业的职工在技术革新运动中，积极开展煤炭综合利用工作，从煤炭中回收并加工出化肥、柴油、汽油、塑料、炭黑、粗苯、酚和锗等二十多种产品。
    旅大市工业部门用煤量很大，但是过去绝大部分煤炭都是直接燃烧，煤炭中副产品全都白白地被跑掉了。1958年，中共旅大市委在大抓节约煤炭的同时，要求各级党委大力开展煤炭综合利用。许多工厂企业的职工采取改革现有设备和增加部分附属设备的方法，迅速扩大回收煤炭副产品的数量和品种。大连化工厂的职工除用煤炭作原料，制造化肥、硫酸等七种主要产品外，去年增添了一套旧的蒸馏和冷凝设备后，每天可回收大量的粗苯和砒碇；又增添一些设备后，从烟道灰中回收到半导体原料。现在，这个工厂正在扩建煤焦油加工设备，以增加回收重中油、苯、萘、蒽、酚和沥青等十二种产品。大连煤气公司的职工利用旧设备和增添一些新设备，从原来回收两种副产品扩大到回收十三种产品，每年可为国家多创造财富五百七十万元。仅其中两个旧釜改装成的一套焦油加工设备，就可以加工出蒽、防腐油、酚、汽油等近十种产品。这个公司的一座半土半洋的炭黑车间，去年就生产炭黑五百九十三吨，运销到上海、天津、青岛等地。大连钢厂、大连电瓷厂、金州重型机器厂等单位已经建立和正在兴建的日产十三立方米煤气的混合煤气发生炉共有十座，这不仅可以增加热效利用率，还可以回收煤焦油。由于使用煤气比煤炭容易控制温度，对提高产品质量和改善工人劳动条件，都有很大好处。
    许多工厂企业还采取土洋结合的方针，建立了大批红旗简易炼焦炉和小型煤气发生炉。仅旅大市重工业局所属几个工厂建立的十几座红旗简易炼焦炉，去年除炼出两万七千多吨冶金焦炭，供应本市小高炉生产外，还回收煤焦油六百八十多吨。大连煤气公司在金州镇兴建的一座简易煤气厂，每天除生产十一吨冶金焦炭、四百公斤煤焦油外，还生产四千五百立方米煤气，供应附近一百五十户居民烧饭、取暖用。全市还建成了三十几座容量为十五吨的方型炉，每座炉子一次可炼出十吨冶金焦，一吨半煤焦油，生产一万多立方米煤气。
    全市还有不少工厂企业与科学机关、大专学校合作，开展了煤炭综合利用新技术的研究。大连第一发电厂、大连煤气公司和大连化工厂等三个单位，在中国科学院煤炭研究室人员的协助下，从烟道灰中提炼出了半导体原料。大连工学院和中国科学院煤炭研究室的技术人员与大连第一发电厂职工一起，正在共同试验“炉前干馏”的尖端技术。旅大市正在兴建一座年加工煤焦油两万吨的焦油加工厂和两座利用煤渣的炉渣砖厂，以适应各厂回收煤炭副产品的需要。
