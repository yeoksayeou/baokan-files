Industry, Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, Banking and Other Departments Work Together to Promote High-Speed Production Development
Tianjin Pharmaceutical Supply Station Organizes Comprehensive Collaboration
Citywide Pharmaceutical Industry Obtains Richer Raw Materials, Each Collaborating Department Advances Together
Editor's Note: Under the unified leadership of the Party, the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Procurement and Supply Station organized a "one-stop" comprehensive collaboration involving relevant industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, and banking departments. This successfully resolved some raw material issues needed by Tianjin's pharmaceutical industry in its production leap forward, and also promoted the development of production and work in other collaborating departments. Facts prove that organizing such "one-stop" collaboration is a relatively advanced form of strengthening cooperation between relevant economic departments and an important way for financial and trade departments to face production and achieve continued leap forward. Organizing this kind of productive collaboration by financial and trade departments (together with material supply departments) is a good way to ensure the continued leap forward of the national economy and is worthy of great promotion.

This newspaper reports that, according to the new situation of the high-speed and sustained leap forward of the national economy, the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Procurement and Supply Station, under the unified leadership of the Party, actively plays the role of a link for commercial departments. It organizes a "one-stop" comprehensive collaboration of industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, banking and other departments, seizes the main problems in high-speed production development, organizes the strength of each collaborating department, cooperates closely, and jointly solves them, promoting the sustained leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.

High Speed Requires Extensive Collaboration

With the high-speed development of the national economy, the pharmaceutical, chemical, reagent and other industrial departments related to the station's purchase and sales business are constantly accelerating the speed of production according to the needs of national construction and the lives of urban and rural people, and are advancing in the direction of producing "high, precise, and advanced" products. Factories and enterprises need more and newer raw materials and equipment, higher technology, and a large amount of funds. Under this new situation, relying solely on the strength of one industry or one factory often cannot solve these new problems that arise in production. This is a relatively prominent contradiction. The station's past collaboration of "production, supply, sales, use, and bank" as a five-in-one entity also seemed narrow in scope and insufficient in strength under this new situation. The objective situation requires more extensive organization of communist collaboration to further promote the production leap forward.

Extensive Collaboration Among Departments, Great Convergence of Mass Movements

Based on summarizing past experiences in industry-commerce collaboration, the station focused on the central task of promoting high-speed production development, seized the main contradiction of raw materials, technology, and equipment not keeping up with the needs of large-scale production, and, on the one hand, carried out a large-scale mass movement within the station, listing solving these problems as an important content of the station's mass movement. On the other hand, it widely organized comprehensive collaboration with relevant industrial, agricultural, commercial, transportation, banking, and scientific research departments to solve them jointly. The scope of collaboration ranged from urban to rural areas, including Tianjin's pharmaceutical, chemical, medical equipment, chemical raw material, glass instrument and other industrial departments, rural people's communes, wholesale and retail commercial departments, as well as railway departments, Peace District bank offices and more than 500 units. A collaboration committee was jointly formed by the main collaborating departments, and special personnel were assigned to set up an office to coordinate, promote and organize collaboration, and closely link the production, acquisition, transportation and distribution links. Subsequently, the collaborating departments jointly launched a competition centered on vigorously engaging in raw material equipment and technology collaboration to promote production. In this way, the station's mass movement became integrated with external mass movements, forming a new situation in which collaborating departments cared for each other, were as close as flesh and blood, and supported each other in times of need.

Implement "Five Unifications" to Implement the Principle of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical

In order to facilitate the unified deployment of forces, work together, and solve key problems in production more, faster, better, and more economically, the departments participating in the collaboration implemented "Five Unifications": First, unified planning. According to the current production and market needs, industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, banking and other departments connect production and sales plans on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis, that is, the production plan of the pharmaceutical industry, the commercial acquisition plan and the credit plan of the bank are directly connected to each other. The raw material plans needed by the pharmaceutical industry department are directly connected to the plans of the chemical reagent, plastic and other industrial departments responsible for producing raw materials, and are arranged uniformly and implemented item by item. Second, unified allocation of raw materials. In accordance with the spirit of ensuring key points, solving urgent needs, and taking care of general needs, we strive to allocate raw materials reasonably, use them appropriately, and exert the greatest effectiveness. Third, unified technical force. According to the different levels of production technology in each factory and enterprise, relevant industrial departments are organized to form technical collaboration groups, so that each factory, based on the spirit of self-reliance and striving for external assistance, implements "technical large-scale matching," shares contracted responsibilities, widely exchanges technical experience, and other methods to help each other and improve together. Fourth, under the principle of not affecting the original production tasks of each department, unify the use of equipment and improve the utilization rate of equipment. Fifth, unified transportation, each collaborating department unifies and connects freight plans with the transportation department on a monthly, ten-day, and weekly basis, and dispatches transportation tools in a planned manner. The implementation of "Five Unifications" has effectively guaranteed and promoted the development of production. For example, through extensive organization of technical collaboration, more than 20 factories in the medical equipment department have improved their production technology level, and the quality of more than 50 kinds of medical equipment products has improved.

Continuously Organize Active Balance to Achieve Comprehensive Leap Forward

After the comprehensive collaboration was organized, they concentrated their efforts, continuously organized active balance, strengthened weak links, and promoted the overall leap forward of production, procurement, sales, and transportation. Since the Great Leap Forward, the production of Tianjin's pharmaceutical industry has greatly increased, but due to the relatively weak technical and equipment base in the past, more than 80% of the intermediate raw materials required for production have been relying on supply from other places. To develop the pharmaceutical industry at high speed, the first step is to develop the production of intermediates in the city through self-reliance. At the advocacy of this purchasing station, relevant industrial, agricultural, commercial, transportation and banking departments participating in the collaboration closely focused on this central link, actively brought into play the special characteristics of their departments, pooled their wisdom and efforts, and cooperated closely. Chemical, plastic, dye, reagent and other industrial departments tapped the potential of equipment, allocated technical forces, vigorously engaged in inter-factory collaboration, and produced intermediate products such as benzyl alcohol and sodium bisulfite that had not been produced in the past. Some people's communes in Jinghai, Ba County, Renqiu and other counties also used local materials to produce medicinal raw materials such as sodium sulfate and potassium fluoride on the spot, supplying the needs of these industrial departments. Commercial departments actively acted as go-betweens, on the one hand organizing relevant industrial and agricultural departments to strengthen collaboration, and on the other hand providing technical data to assist in solving equipment problems. Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Drug Inspection Institute and other departments also sent people to the site to guide and help improve production technology. Banking, transportation and other departments also gave strong support. Through such close collaboration, the self-sufficiency capacity of the intermediate products needed by Tianjin's pharmaceutical industry was 16% at the end of last year, and has now increased to 30%. In January, more than 70 kinds of raw materials were put into production, of which more than 30 kinds of raw materials have been self-sufficient, which greatly promoted the high-speed development of the pharmaceutical industry.

Due to the rapid development of pharmaceutical industry production, it has also promoted the leap forward of other collaborating departments. First of all, the chemical industry department, which produces intermediate products for this industry, has leaped forward. In January of this year, more than 30 kinds of intermediate products that had not been produced in the past were produced, accounting for about 15% of the total output value. The relevant people's communes in various counties in the city used local mirabilite and hemp seeds to produce more than 30 kinds of medicinal raw materials, increasing the income of the communes and improving the level of production technology. With the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the commodity circulation of the pharmaceutical station has also expanded accordingly. In January, local purchases increased by more than 46% compared with the same period last year, which strongly supported market needs.

Adhering to Politics in Command is the Fundamental Guarantee for Doing a Good Job in Collaboration

Adhering to politics in command and strengthening the unified leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out communist collaboration. The party committee secretaries of the main departments participating in the collaboration, such as industry, commerce, and banking, personally took charge and jointly formed a core leading group to strengthen ideological education and organizational leadership of the collaborating departments. The party organizations of various collaborating departments promptly carried out education on communist collaboration among employees, making everyone realize that vigorously engaging in communist collaboration is a matter of promoting high-speed production development and implementing the general line, so they consciously acted and actively participated in the collaboration.

    工、农、商、交通、银行等部门同心协力促进生产高速度发展
    天津医药供应站组织全面大协作
    全市制药工业得到更丰富的原料各个协作部门共同跃进
    编者按：天津医药采购供应站在党的统一领导下，组织有关工业、农业、商业、交通运输和银行等部门开展“一条龙”大协作，既顺利解决了天津市制药工业在生产跃进中所需要的某些原料问题，又促进了其他协作部门生产和工作的发展。事实证明，组织这样的“一条龙”大协作，是有关经济部门之间加强协作的一种比较高级的形式，也是财贸部门面向生产、实现继续跃进的一个重要途径。由财贸部门（和物资供应部门一道）组织这种生产性的大协作，是保证国民经济继续跃进的一个好办法，值得大大提倡。
    本报讯　天津医药采购供应站根据国民经济高速度持续跃进的新形势，在党的统一领导下，积极发挥商业部门的纽带作用，组织工、农、商、交通运输、银行等部门的“一条龙”大协作，抓住高速度发展生产中的主要问题，组织各个协作部门的力量，通力协作，共同解决，促进工农业生产的持续跃进。
    高速度要求大协作
    随着国民经济的高速度发展，同这个采购站购销业务有关的制药、化学、试剂等工业部门，根据国家建设和城乡人民生活的需要，正不断加快速度发展生产，向生产“高、精、尖”产品的方向进军，各工厂企业需要更多、更新的原料、设备，需要更高的技术和大量资金。在这种新情况下，单靠一个行业、一个工厂的力量，往往不能解决生产当中出现的这些新问题。这是一个比较突出的矛盾。这个站过去组织的“产、供、销、用、银行”五位一体的协作，在这新的情况下，也显得范围狭小，力量不够了，客观形势要求更广泛地组织共产主义大协作，进一步促进生产跃进。
    各部门大协作　群众运动大合流
    这个站在总结过去搞工商协作经验的基础上，围绕促进生产高速度发展的中心课题，抓住原料、技术、设备赶不上大规模生产需要的主要矛盾，一面在站内大搞群众运动，把解决这些问题列为站内群众运动的重要内容；一面广泛组织有关工业、农业、商业、交通运输、银行和科学研究部门全面协作，共同解决。协作范围，从城市到农村，包括天津市医药、化学、医疗器械、化工原料、玻璃仪器等工业部门，农村的人民公社，商业的批发、零售部门以及铁路部门、和平区银行办事处等五百多个单位。由主要协作部门共同组成协作委员会，抽调专人设立办事机构，统筹安排，推动和组织协作，把生产、收购、运输、分配各个环节紧密联结起来。接着，各个协作部门又共同开展了以大搞原料设备和技术协作、促进生产为中心的竞赛。这样，这个站的群众运动就和外部群众运动结成一体，形成各协作部门相互关心、骨肉相连、一方有事、多方支援的新局面。
    实行“五统一”　贯彻多快好省方针
    参加协作的部门，为了便于统一调度力量，齐心协力，多、快、好、省地解决生产中的关键问题，他们实行了“五统一”：第一，统一计划。工、农、商、交、银行等部门，根据当前生产和市场需要情况，按年、按季、按月地衔接产销计划，即制药工业的生产计划、商业收购计划和银行的信贷计划互相对口衔接；制药工业部门需要的原料计划和负责生产原料的化学试剂、塑料等工业部门的计划对口衔接，统一安排，逐项落实。第二，统一调配原料。根据保证重点、解决急需、照顾一般的精神，力求原料分配合理，使用恰当，发挥最大效能。第三，统一技术力量。根据各工厂企业生产技术水平高低不同情况，组织有关工业部门成立技术协作小组，使各厂本着自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的精神，实行“技术大配套”，分摊包干负责、广泛交流技术经验等办法，互相帮助，共同提高。第四，在不影响各部门原有生产任务的原则下，统一利用设备，提高设备利用率。第五，统一运输，各协作部门统一与运输部门按月、按旬、按周衔接货运计划，有计划地调度运输工具。实行“五统一”，有力地保证和促进了生产的发展。例如，通过广泛地组织技术协作，只医疗器械部门就有二十多家工厂提高了生产技术水平，有五十多种医疗器械产品的质量提高了。
    不断组织积极平衡　实现全面跃进
    全面大协作组织起来以后，他们集中力量，不断组织积极平衡，加强薄弱环节，推动产、购、销、运全面跃进。大跃进以来，天津市制药工业生产有了很大增长，但是，由于过去技术、设备基础比较薄弱，生产需用的中间体原料，有80％以上一直依靠外地供应。要高速度发展医药工业，首先就要在本市自力更生发展中间体的生产。在这个采购站的倡导下，参加协作的有关工业、农业、商业、交通运输和银行部门，就紧紧围绕这个中心环节，积极发挥本部门的特长，群策群力，通力协作。化学、塑料、染料、试剂等工业部门，挖掘设备潜力，调配技术力量，大搞厂际协作，生产过去没有生产过的苯甲醇、亚硫酸氢纳等中间体；静海、霸县、任丘等县有些人民公社也就地取材，就地生产硫酸纳、氟化钾等中间体原料，供应这些工业部门的需要。商业部门积极穿针引线，一面组织有关工农业部门加强协作，一面提供技术资料，协助解决设备。天津医科大学、天津药品检验所等部门也分别派人到现场指导，帮助提高生产技术。银行、运输等部门也都给了有力的支援。经过这样通力协作，天津市制药工业需要的中间体，去年年底自给能力为16％，目前已提高到30％。1月份，有七十多种原料投入了生产，其中，有三十多种原料已能自给自足，大大促进了制药工业的高速度发展。
    由于制药工业生产迅速发展，也促进了其他协作部门的跃进。首先是为这个工业生产中间体的化学工业部门跃进了。今年1月份，生产出过去没有生产过的中间体就有三十多种，约占总产值的15％左右。本市各县有关的人民公社，利用当地皮硝、大麻籽生产药用原料三十多种，增加了公社收入，也提高了生产技术水平。工农业生产跃进了，医药站的商品流通也相应扩大了，1月份，当地进货比去年同期增加46％以上，有力地支援了市场需要。
    坚持政治挂帅是搞好协作的根本保证
    坚持政治挂帅，加强党的统一领导，是开展共产主义大协作的根本保证。参加协作的工业、商业、银行等主要部门的党委书记，都亲自挂帅，共同组成一个核心领导小组，加强对各协作部门的思想教育和组织领导。各个协作部门的党组织，及时地对职工群众进行共产主义大协作的教育，使大家认识到，大搞共产主义协作，是促进生产高速度发展、贯彻总路线的问题，因而自觉地行动起来，积极参与协作。
