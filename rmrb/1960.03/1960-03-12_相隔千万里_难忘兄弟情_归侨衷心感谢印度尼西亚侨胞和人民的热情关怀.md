Xinhua News Agency report: Overseas Chinese who recently returned to Guangzhou from Indonesia expressed their heartfelt gratitude to Indonesian Chinese organizations and local Overseas Chinese for their care and assistance.

During the anti-Chinese movement by powerful groups in Indonesia, these Overseas Chinese lost their means of livelihood, and faced great difficulties with food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Chinese organizations and local Overseas Chinese gave them "timely help," helping them reduce their living difficulties and suffering. More than 500 Overseas Chinese who were forcibly concentrated in the Lianwang area near Bandung had no food to eat, and local Overseas Chinese enthusiastically sent them rice, firewood, and vegetables. In the areas of Cimahe, Cianjur, Lianwang, and Garut, thousands of Overseas Chinese who were forcibly concentrated also received assistance from local Overseas Chinese, who sent them food, clothing, and necessities, and invited doctors to treat them.

Overseas Chinese also received sincere help from local Chinese organizations and Overseas Chinese when they departed from Indonesia to return to China. More than 180 Overseas Chinese from Garut, West Java, arrived at the port of Jakarta on time, but were obstructed from boarding the ship, and their food and lodging became a problem. Local Overseas Chinese vacated houses for them to live in and cooked meals for them to eat. At 11 o'clock that night, a couple of Overseas Chinese from Bogor drove a car from more than 60 kilometers away to bring fruit to the returning Overseas Chinese in Jakarta. Huang Shengxi, a young Overseas Chinese who returned from Cimahe, said that hundreds of Overseas Chinese who were forcibly concentrated in Cimahe were obstructed in Jakarta when they prepared to take a ship back to China from Cimahe to Jakarta. Overseas Chinese from local Chinese organizations immediately sent rice, vegetables, biscuits, coffee, fruit, etc. On the afternoon of the 20th, when we set off to board the ship, local Overseas Chinese and Overseas Chinese students came to see us off and helped us carry our luggage. We are very grateful to the Overseas Chinese still in Indonesia for their help and care.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th: Overseas Chinese from Indonesia who returned to Guangzhou on February 29 deeply miss the Indonesian people and expressed their determination to forever safeguard the friendship established with the Indonesian people in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

Liu Changjiang, a returned Overseas Chinese from Cipadung, said: "We have lived with the Indonesian people for a long time, and have suffered the oppression of Japanese imperialism and Dutch colonialism together, and have also participated in the struggle against imperialism together." He said that when the Dutch colonial army launched the so-called "police action" in 1947, he and many Overseas Chinese contributed money and efforts to support the Indonesian people's struggle for independence, and he also participated in the "sabotage team" that resisted the Dutch army. The local Indonesian people called the Overseas Chinese "the closest comrades-in-arms."

Overseas Chinese who returned from various parts of Indonesia all talked about how they contributed to the development of the Indonesian economy and have established a deep friendship with the local people. Cai Yude, a returned Overseas Chinese from Cigaron, Garut, said that after Indonesia declared its independence, the Overseas Chinese who moved to Cigaron worked with the local people to develop the overgrown wasteland. Over the past ten years, the Overseas Chinese have developed two to three thousand mu of land there. Overseas Chinese and local people often give each other harvested agricultural products, and get along like a family. Chen Wangqing, a returned Overseas Chinese from Ciwidey near Bandung, said that when they went there twenty years ago, the market town had few houses and few people, and there was not even a school. Overseas Chinese and Indonesian people jointly built houses and schools, and prospered the place. The local people said: "The prosperity of Ciwidey was brought by the Overseas Chinese."

    相隔千万里　难忘兄弟情
    归侨衷心感谢印度尼西亚侨胞和人民的热情关怀
    据新华社讯　最近回到广州的印度尼西亚侨胞，表示衷心感谢印度尼西亚华侨团体和当地侨胞对他们的百般关怀和帮助。
    这批侨胞在印度尼西亚有势力集团的排华运动中，失去了谋生的手段，衣、食、住、行都遇到了很大困难。华侨团体和当地侨胞给他们“雪中送炭”，帮助他们减少生活上的困难和痛苦。被强迫集中到万隆附近连旺地区的五百多名侨胞没有饭吃，当地侨胞热情地给他们送米、柴和蔬菜。在芝马圩、展玉、连旺和牙律地区，被强迫集中的上千侨胞，也同样得到了当地侨胞的帮助，送给吃的、穿的、用的，并请医生为他们治病。
    归侨从印度尼西亚动身回国时也得到了当地华侨团体和侨胞的热诚帮助。西爪哇牙律的一百八十多名华侨按时到达雅加达港口的时候，受到阻难，不能上船，食宿都成问题。当地侨胞腾出房子给他们住，煮饭给他们吃。那天晚上十一时，有一位茂物的侨胞，夫妇两人驾驶了一辆汽车，从六十多公里外把水果送到雅加达给归侨们吃。从芝马圩回来的青年归侨黄声熙说，被强迫集中在芝马圩的数百名侨胞，从芝马圩到雅加达准备乘船回国，在雅加达受到阻难，当地华侨团体的侨胞立即送来饭、菜、饼干以及咖啡、水果等。20日下午，当我们动身上船的时候，当地侨胞和华侨学生都出来欢送，替我们搬运行李。我们非常感谢尚在印度尼西亚的侨胞对我们的帮助和照顾。
    据新华社广州10日电　2月29日回到广州的印度尼西亚华侨，深切怀念印度尼西亚人民，表示要永远维护同印度尼西亚人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义共同斗争中建立起来的友谊。
    从芝巴德回来的归侨刘长江说：“我们长期同印度尼西亚人民生活在一起，共同遭受过日本帝国主义和荷兰殖民者的压迫，也共同参加过反对帝国主义的斗争。”他说，当荷兰殖民者的军队在1947年发动所谓“警卫行动”的时候，他和许多华侨出钱出力，支援印度尼西亚人民的独立斗争，他还参加了反抗荷兰军队的“破坏队”。当地的印度尼西亚人民把华侨称为“最亲密的战友”。
    从印度尼西亚各地回来的华侨都谈到，他们在发展印度尼西亚经济中贡献了力量，和当地人民已经建立起深厚的友谊。从牙律芝加隆归来的华侨蔡玉德说，在印度尼西亚宣布独立以后，迁到芝加隆的华侨，和当地人民一起开发长满野草的荒地。十多年来，华侨在那里开发了两、三千亩土地。华侨和当地人民经常互相赠送收获的农产品，相处得像一家人一样。从万隆附近芝维勒回来的华侨陈旺庆说，当他们在二十年前到那里去的时候，这个圩镇屋少人稀，一所学校也没有。华侨和印度尼西亚人民共同盖房子、办学校，繁荣了这个地方。当地的人民说：“芝维勒的繁荣是华侨带去的。”（附图片）
