Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing—The vigorous technical revolution and technical innovation movement sweeping across enterprises in Nanjing is rapidly accelerating the pace of mechanization.

According to current statistics, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city's construction system has increased from 10% last year to 35.66%; the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the foundry system has increased from 29.62% to 51.24%. From the beginning of February to the 25th, the city has established one hundred and fourteen automatic production lines, six hundred and twenty-one production assembly lines, eight hundred and seventy-six single automated machines, seventeen automated groups and sections, and three thousand one hundred and forty-seven mechanized and semi-mechanized projects. With the increasing level of mechanization and automation, labor productivity has increased exponentially, and production has risen steadily. The total output value completed by factories and mines in the city in the past month and a half has increased by 1.6 times compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan—The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Wuhan is like a storm, reaching an unprecedented speed, thereby promoting a leap in labor productivity.

The new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution in Wuhan is not only fast, but also nationwide. From the most modernly equipped Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation to the completely manual street factories, from production departments to service industries, from individuals, workshops to entire industries, the broad masses of workers are in high spirits, daring to think and daring to act. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's coking plant is a completely modern factory. Many people in the plant used to think that the central issue of the plant was to learn how to operate the equipment, and that engaging in technical innovation was "tickling the tiger's nose - asking for trouble." Recently, the workers of this plant broke with superstition and implemented more than one thousand seven hundred innovation projects. The workers of small factories and enterprises are not to be outdone. In the past, the vast majority of processes in the fitter workshop of the Qiaokou District Machinery Factory were manual operations; but in the last two or three days, the workers made their own rolling beds, grinders, and punch presses, basically realizing the mechanization of the production process. Many workers describe their factories as being "more powerful than the Monkey King, changing seventy-three times a day."

    南京机械化程度迅速提高
    武汉全民搞革新速度空前
    据新华社南京电　南京市各企业掀起的热火朝天的技术革命和技术革新运动，迅速促进了机械化程度的提高。
    根据到目前为止的统计，全市建筑系统的机械化和半机械化程度，已由去年的10％提高到35．66％；铸工系统的机械化半机械化程度，已由29．62％提高到51．24％。从2月上旬到25日止，全市出现了一百一十四条生产自动线，六百二十一条生产流水线，单机自动化八百七十六台，自动化小组、工段十七个，机械化半机械化项目三千一百四十七项。随着机械化、自动化程度的提高，劳动生产率成倍提高，生产节节上升，全市厂矿企业在今年一个半月之内完成的总产值比去年同期增长了一点六倍。
    据新华社武汉电　武汉市的技术革新和技术革命运动有如暴风骤雨，出现了空前未有的高速度。从而促进了劳动生产率的飞跃提高。
    武汉市技术革新和技术革命新高潮不仅速度快，而且是全民性的。从设备最新的武钢到完全手工操作的街道工厂，从生产部门到服务性行业，从个人、车间到整个行业，广大职工意气风发，敢想敢干。武钢焦化厂是个设备完全现代化的工厂，厂里很多人过去认为本厂的中心问题是学会操作，要闹技术革新是“太岁头上动土——自找麻烦”。最近，这个厂的职工打破了迷信，实现了革新项目一千七百多件。各小厂企业的职工也不示弱。硚口区机器厂钳工车间过去绝大部分工序是手工操作；但是在最近两三天之内，工人就自制了滚床、磨床、冲床，使生产过程基本上实现了机械化。很多工人形容自己的工厂“比孙悟空还厉害，一天七十三变。”
