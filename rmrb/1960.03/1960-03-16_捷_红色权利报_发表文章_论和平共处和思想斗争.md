    Czechoslovakian "Red Rights" Newspaper Publishes Article
    On Peaceful Coexistence and Ideological Struggle
    Points out: Since the emergence of the socialist system, socialism has been in competition with capitalism in all basic areas of life. The relationship between the two systems always contains elements of class struggle. Socialist countries should publicize their construction achievements, spread the truth, and refute the lies spread by the bourgeois propaganda machine to defend the capitalist system.

    The "Red Rights" newspaper of Czechoslovakia published an article entitled "Peaceful Coexistence and Ideological Struggle" on the 12th.

    The article said that since the emergence of the socialist system, socialism has been in competition with capitalism in all basic areas of life. The relationship between the two systems always contains elements of class struggle. The forms of this class struggle are naturally diverse.

    The article said that we first promote the victory of socialist ideology on a global scale through the example of our internal construction. Socialist countries hope to compete in such a way: to see which system can bring people a comprehensive, better, and richer life. Under the conditions of this peaceful coexistence, ideological struggle plays a significant role. Socialist countries should publicize their construction achievements, spread the truth, and refute the lies and slanders spread by the bourgeois propaganda machine to defend the capitalist system.

    The article said that some naive people in our country believe that when international tensions ease and many bourgeois politicians see that their policies are untenable, the intensity and significance of the ideological struggle will inevitably decrease. The article points out that these people do not understand that the new tone of bourgeois politicians is sometimes just old content in new words. When certain bourgeois politicians change the tone of their discussions with us, this should naturally be welcomed. However, their words must be compared with their actions, and it must be seen whether they say one thing in one place and another thing in another place. The practice of the past five years has clearly proved that the development of economic cooperation, cultural, artistic, scientific, and other relations between countries with different social systems has far from led to the weakening of ideological struggle. The strengthening of modern revisionist activities and the strengthening of activities to carry out ideological infiltration are also proof of the above argument. Therefore, it is incorrect to believe that the ideological struggle is also easing due to the relaxation of international relations, and thus to fall into various illusions in this regard.

    The article points out that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems cannot be equated with the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie within a country. What the Communists advocate is peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. This does not mean that the Communists oppose the people of a country overthrowing a government they consider bad. The example of a revolution in one country can have a huge impact on other countries, but this ideological influence can only work when the people of other countries themselves recognize the need for change.

    捷“红色权利报”发表文章
    论和平共处和思想斗争
    指出：从社会主义体系产生以来，社会主义就与资本主义在生活的所有基本领域中进行着竞赛。两个体系之间的关系，永远包含着阶级斗争的因素。社会主义国家要宣传自己的建设成就、传播真理、驳倒资产阶级宣传机器为资本主义制度进行辩护而散布的谎言。
    新华社布拉格14日电　“红色权利报”12日发表了一篇题为“和平共处和思想斗争”的文章。
    文章说，从社会主义体系产生以来，社会主义就与资本主义在生活的所有基本领域中进行着竞赛。两个体系之间的关系，永远包含着阶级斗争的因素。这一阶级斗争的形式自然是各式各样的。
    文章说，我们首先是用本国内部建设的榜样来促进社会主义思想在全世界范围内的胜利。社会主义国家希望在这样一个方面进行竞赛：看看哪一个制度能给人民带来全面的更加美好和更加富裕的生活。在这种和平共处的条件下，思想意识方面的斗争就具有很大作用。社会主义国家要宣传自己的建设成就、传播真理、驳倒资产阶级宣传机器为资本主义制度进行辩护而散布的谎言和诽谤。
    文章说，我国有些天真的人，以为当国际紧张局势缓和、许多资产阶级政界人物看到他们的政策是站不住脚时，思想意识方面斗争的强度和意义就必然会降低。文章指出，这些人不了解，资产阶级政界人物的新语调有时候只不过是老内容、新词句而已。当某些资产阶级政界人物改变同我们讨论的语调时，对这种情况自然应该欢迎。但是，必须把他们的言词与行动作对比，并且要看他们是否在一个地方这样说，到另一个地方又那样说。最近五年来的实践清楚地证明，不同社会制度的国家间的经济合作的开展，文化、艺术、科学及其它关系的发展，远远没有导向思想意识斗争的削弱。现代修正主义活动的加强、思想意识方面进行渗透的活动的加强，这些也是上述论断的证明。因此，由于国际关系缓和而认为意识形态方面的斗争也缓和，从而在这方面陷入各种幻想，这些都是不正确的。
    文章指出，不能把不同社会制度的国家间的和平共处与一个国家内部无产阶级与资产阶级间的斗争混为一谈。共产党人主张的是不同制度国家之间的和平共处。这不意味着，共产党人反对某一国家的人民推翻他们认为不好的政府。一国革命的榜样可以对别的国家发生巨大影响，但是，这种思想影响只有在别国人民自己认识到进行变革的必要时才能起作用。
