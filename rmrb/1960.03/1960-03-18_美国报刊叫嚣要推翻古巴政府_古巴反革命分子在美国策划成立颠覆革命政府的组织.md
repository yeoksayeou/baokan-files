Xinhua News Agency, March 17th -- While the U.S. government is stepping up its plans to further interfere in Cuba, the U.S. press and certain reactionary organizations are also chiming in loudly, continuously issuing a chorus of anti-Cuban clamor.

The prematurely released March 21st issue of "U.S. News & World Report" features an article by the editor and reactionary commentator David Lawrence, who is doing his utmost to support the U.S. government's proposal to sever diplomatic relations with Cuba. He also advocated conducting counter-revolutionary propaganda from the United States through radio stations to Cuba, to incite "Cubans to rise up and choose a steady leadership."

In an article published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on March 14th, U.S. columnist Alsop openly talked about the possibility of the United States carrying out savage military intervention in Cuba. He said, "If necessary, a great power can crush its accusers by force," which "requires strength and ruthlessness."

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" editorial on March 12th implied that Cuba's anti-American measures to safeguard its national interests might "create incidents." The newspaper threatened Cuba, saying that the Cuban government's accusations against the United States were "extremely dangerous."

It cursed the Cuban revolutionary regime, saying it "will not last forever."

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th, Miami dispatch: Cuban counter-revolutionaries are secretly plotting in Miami, Florida, in the United States, to establish a "unified" counter-revolutionary organization to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government.

According to a United Press International report, Caxigas, the leader of the Cuban counter-revolutionaries who fled to Mount Dora in central Florida, admitted in Miami on March 15th that "attempts are now being made to form a unified organization to overthrow Cuban Prime Minister Castro." Caxigas came to Miami specifically to hold secret consultations with Eleuterio Pedraza, the former Chief of Staff of the Batista dictatorship.

Caxigas indicated that their "consistent plan is based on the establishment of an executive committee" to collect "all of Castro's enemies at home and abroad" and "jointly shoulder" the "responsibility" of restoring a dictatorship in Cuba that would serve U.S. imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th, Trujillo City, Dominican Republic dispatch: Dominican Senate President Herrera publicly called on the "Organization of American States" to take action to intervene in Cuba at a press conference held in Trujillo City on March 14th.

Herrera made the above statement at a time when the U.S. attempt to interfere in Cuba through the "Organization of American States" under its control was becoming increasingly blatant. As is well known, the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic has been playing an important role in the U.S. conspiracy to interfere in Cuba.

At this press conference, Herrera repeated the platitudes spread by the United States to create pretexts for intervention in Cuba, clamoring that "in order to defend the Christian civilization of the Western Hemisphere" and "to deal with the threat of Cuba being dragged into the Soviet bloc, action by the Organization of American States is necessary."

It is worth noting that just two days before Herrera made this statement, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Rubottom publicly advocated, in a speech at the University of Wisconsin on March 12th, taking "collective security measures against any form of aggression" based on the 1954 "Caracas Declaration." It was precisely under the cover of this declaration that the United States launched a bloody intervention in Guatemala.

    美国报刊叫嚣要推翻古巴政府
    古巴反革命分子在美国策划成立颠覆革命政府的组织
    多米尼加参议院议长竟要求“美洲国家组织”采取行动干涉古巴
    据新华社17日讯　在美国政府加紧策划进一步干涉古巴的同时，美国报界和某些反动组织也在大事帮腔，连续发出一片反对古巴的叫嚣。
    提前出版的3月21日一期的“美国新闻和世界报道”杂志主编、反动评论家戴维·劳伦斯竭力为美国政府正在考虑的同古巴断绝外交关系的主张捧场。他还主张从美国通过广播电台向古巴进行煽动颠覆活动的反革命宣传，以便让“古巴人起来选择一个稳健的领导”。
    美国专栏作家艾尔索普14日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表的文章中，公然谈到美国对古巴进行野蛮的军事干涉的可能性。他说，“如果有必要，大国可以用武力粉碎它的指责者”，这“需要力量和无情”。
    “华盛顿邮报与时代先驱报”在12日发表的社论暗示，古巴为维护民族利益而采取反美措施可能“造成事件”。这家报纸威胁古巴说，古巴政府对美国提出的指责是“极端危险的”。
    它诅咒古巴革命政权“将不会永远持久下去”。
    新华社16日讯　迈阿密消息：古巴反革命分子正在美国佛罗里达州的迈阿密城阴谋策划成立颠覆古巴革命政府的“统一的”反革命组织。
    据合众国际社消息，潜逃在佛罗里达州中部多拉山的古巴反革命分子的头目卡希加斯15日在迈阿密城承认，“现在正在进行尝试来成立一个统一的组织，以便推翻古巴总理卡斯特罗”。卡希加斯到迈阿密来是专门同前巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的陆军总监埃莱乌特里奥·佩德拉萨举行秘密会商的。
    卡希加斯表明，他们“一致的计划是以成立一个执行委员会为基础”来搜罗“古巴国内外所有卡斯特罗的敌人”，“共同担负”起在古巴恢复为美帝国主义效劳的独裁统治的“责任”。
    新华社16日讯　多米尼加特鲁希略城消息：多米尼加参议院议长埃雷拉14日在特鲁希略城举行的记者招待会上，公然要求“美洲国家组织”采取行动来干涉古巴。
    埃雷拉是在美国企图通过由它控制的“美洲国家组织”来干涉古巴的阴谋日益露骨的情况下，提出上述主张的。如所周知，多米尼加的特鲁希略独裁政权在美国干涉古巴的阴谋活动中一直扮演着重要的角色。
    埃雷拉在这次记者招待会上，重复美国为制造干涉古巴的借口而散布的滥调，叫嚷什么“为了保卫西半球的基督文明”，“为了对付古巴被拖入苏联集团的威胁，美洲国家组织的行动是必要的”。
    值得注意的是，就在埃雷拉发表这次谈话的前两天，美国国务院美洲事务助理国务卿鲁博特姆12日在美国威斯康星大学发表讲话时，曾经公开鼓吹根据1954年的“加拉加斯宣言”，采取“集体安全措施来反对任何形式的侵略”。美国正是在这项宣言的掩护下，对危地马拉发动血腥的干涉的。
