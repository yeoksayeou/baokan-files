Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 21st: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party issued a statement on the Lao general election. The statement exposes that the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," under the command of US imperialism, tampered with the election law. The purpose of holding the general election is to turn the soon-to-be-elected parliament into a tool for them to establish a military dictatorship and turn Laos into a new colony and military base of US imperialism.

The statement, published in the "Lao Patriotic News" on March 19th, pointed out that their current approach to the election violates the wishes and democratic freedoms of the Lao people, violates the Kingdom's constitution, and is consistent with previous acts of undermining the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, which serve as the basis for cooperation between the Lao Kingdom and the Lao Fighting Forces. The purpose of doing so is to undermine Lao national harmony, undermine national unity, and undermine the right of the Lao Patriotic Front Party to engage in free activities.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front Party had made great efforts to participate in the upcoming general election. However, due to all sorts of obstruction by the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," the lackeys of US imperialism, the list of candidates announced by the Ministry of Interior a week ago did not include any representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front Party.

The statement exposed the fascist nature of this "election," saying that because the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" made many new and unreasonable regulations for the general election, in many constituencies, only one or two people can become candidates, and the people must vote whether they agree with them or not, with no other choice. They also deprive many voters of their right to vote by not issuing voter registration cards, and threaten those who can vote to vote for them. They threatened: "If anyone does not vote for them, the government will not allow them to live in Laos, and they will all be beheaded."

The statement said that they are driving regular and irregular troops to conduct brutal "sweeps" and persecutions against the people of Luang Prabang, Sam Neua, Phongsaly, Xieng Khouang, and Khammouane provinces under the guise of so-called "exercises." Currently, the four mobile regiments of the Lao Royal Army are conducting "sweeps" in the provinces of Lower Laos, in coordination with 10,000 Ngo Dinh Diem troops conducting "sweeps" on the Laos-Vietnam border. They are vigorously forcing residents to relocate to concentrated settlements around strongholds, and arresting and killing patriotic and peace-loving people on a large scale. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the Lao people to exercise their democratic rights in this general election.

The statement said, "The Lao Patriotic Front Party, which has always adhered to a position of peace and neutrality, safeguarding the independence of the motherland, and safeguarding democratic freedoms and the constitution, hereby solemnly declares: (1) Resolutely opposes the amendment of the election law and opposes the Kingdom authorities' various actions to obstruct the participation of the Lao Patriotic Front Party's representatives in the election, and believes that this is an act of depriving the Lao Patriotic Front Party of its right to conduct free activities; (2) Demands that the Kingdom government immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other members and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party who are still imprisoned, and allow them to participate in the election; (3) Demands that the Kingdom government stop the civil war, stop the 'sweeps' and persecution of the people. The Kingdom government must not send troops to conduct 'sweeps' and persecute the people in order to put pressure on the people in the general election. It is necessary to restore the normal life of the country so that the general election can be conducted democratically and in an orderly manner."

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front Party puts the interests of the motherland and the people first, and is ready to actively participate in the general election together with the people of the whole country, and is ready to unite and support all patriotic and peace-loving political parties and individuals, and work with them to oppose US imperialism, oppose the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," and oppose the policy of interference and the policy of military dictatorship.

The statement said that if the lackeys of US imperialism continue to use troops to "sweep" and persecute the people, and blatantly force the people to vote for them, then the Lao Patriotic Front Party will have no choice but to resolutely lead the people to resist them.

### 老挝爱国战线党就大选发表声明  反对美国干涉和法西斯选举

    老挝爱国战线党就大选发表声明
    反对美国干涉和法西斯选举
    新华社河内21日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会就老挝大选发表声明。声明揭露老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们在美帝国主义命令下篡改选举法，举行大选的目的是为了把即将选出的国会变成他们建立军事独裁制度、把老挝变成美帝国主义新的殖民地和军事基地的工具。
    这篇登在3月19日的“老挝爱国新闻”上的声明指出，目前他们对于选举的作法，违反了老挝人民的愿望和民主自由权利，违反了王国宪法，是同以前破坏作为老挝王国方面和寮国战斗部队实行合作的基础的日内瓦协议和万象协议的种种行为是一脉相承的。这样做的目的是在于破坏老挝民族和睦，破坏国家统一和老挝爱国战线党自由活动的权利。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党曾经作出很大努力，来参加将要举行的大选。但由于美帝国主义的走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们千方百计进行阻挠，以致在内务部一周前公布的候选人名单中竟没有老挝爱国战线党的代表。
    声明揭露这次“选举”的法西斯性质时说，由于“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们对大选作了许多新的无理的规定，许多选区，只有一两个人能当上候选人，而人民不管同意不同意他们，都要去投票，不能有另外的选择；他们还用不发选民证的办法剥夺许多选民的选举权，并且威胁那些能参加投票的人投他们的票。他们恫吓说：“如果谁不给它们投票，政府就不准许他们在老挝居住，并且一律要被砍头”。
    声明说，他们正在驱使正规军和非正规军在所谓“演习”的幌子下，对琅勃拉邦、桑怒、丰沙里、川圹、甘蒙等省人民大肆进行残暴的“扫荡”和迫害。目前，老挝王国军队的四个机动兵团正在下寮各省进行“扫荡”，以配合一万名吴庭艳军队在老越边境进行的“扫荡”。它们大力把居民迫迁到据点周围去集中居住，大批地逮捕和杀害爱国爱和平的人民。在这种情况下，老挝人民在这次大选中是难以行使自己的民主权利的。
    声明说，“一向坚持和平中立、维护祖国的独立、维护民主自由权利和宪法的立场的老挝爱国战线党特郑重宣布：（一）坚决反对修改选举法，反对王国当局百般阻挠老挝爱国战线党代表参加竞选的行为，并认为这种勾当是剥夺老挝爱国战线党进行自由活动的权利的行为；（二）要求王国政府立即恢复仍被监禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其它议员和干部的自由，让他们参加竞选；（三）要求王国政府停止内战，停止‘扫荡’和迫害人民。不许王国政府为了在大选中给人民施加压力而派军队去进行‘扫荡’和迫害人民。必须恢复国家的正常生活，使大选能够民主地、有秩序地进行。”
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党以祖国和人民的利益为重，随时准备同全国人民一起积极参加大选，准备团结和支持一切爱国爱和平的政治党派和个人，同他们一起反对美帝国主义，反对所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们，反对干涉政策和军事独裁政策。
    声明说，如果美帝国主义的走狗仍坚持使用军队“扫荡”和迫害人民，明目张胆地强迫人民去投他们的票，那么，老挝爱国战线党只好坚决领导人民抵抗他们。
