Xinhua News Agency, 10th March: Communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China was held in Beijing from February 27 to March 4, 1960. Attending the meeting were 106 members and alternate members of the Central Committee, and 76 responsible cadres from the League's provincial, municipal, autonomous regional, prefectural, and county committees. Under the cordial concern and direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the plenary session summarized the work of 1959, discussed the situation of socialist construction in our country, and decided on the work tasks of the League for 1960. The plenary session also elected additional members to the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and secretaries to the Secretariat.

The plenary session considered that the situation of socialist construction in our country is unprecedentedly excellent. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which opposed right-leaning tendencies and encouraged greater efforts, the people of the whole country, closely united and with one heart and one mind, held high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, overfulfilled the national economic plan for 1959, and achieved the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Now, the enthusiasm of the people of our country for building socialism is even higher, the scale of mass movements is even broader, and a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement is unfolding fiercely on all fronts. Our country's socialist construction has entered a new stage of continuous leaps forward with both high speed and proportionality. In the Great Leap Forward of the whole people, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels resolutely guaranteed the leadership of the Party, adhered to the communist direction of the youth movement and the principle of vigorously launching mass movements, and thus achieved great successes in their work. The political and ideological level and work level of the League's cadres have also been significantly improved. Through the tempering of actual struggles and the socialist education movement, the three great treasures of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have taken root in the minds of the youth, the broad masses of youth have established communist ambitions, the spirit of collectivism has been greatly enhanced, the communist style has been greatly developed, and they have become more loving of the Party and Chairman Mao, and have more deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp weapon that is invincible and can overcome all obstacles. They have worked heroically and creatively on all fronts, making outstanding contributions to the motherland. This noble spiritual outlook of the youth of our country marks a new upsurge of communist ideology. This is a great victory of Marxism-Leninism and a result of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The plenary session believes that the central task of the League at present is: under the close leadership of the Party, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to strengthen the communist ideological education of the youth, and further enhance the communist consciousness of the whole League and the youth of the whole country; vigorously carry out a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, and heroically strive to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction in 1960.

Continuing to strengthen communist ideological education and further enhance the communist consciousness of the youth of our country is the core issue related to how to better give play to the vanguard role of the youth in socialist construction, and it is also the fundamental issue of cultivating the youth to become successors to the communist cause. The plenary session believes that in the current communist ideological education, first of all, it is necessary to vigorously conduct education on revolutionary ideals to help the youth further establish communist ambitions. It is necessary to educate the youth with the idea of continuous revolution, requiring them to fully recognize the current situation, be full of confidence, be down-to-earth, and do a good job in the current construction cause; at the same time, it is also necessary to fully recognize the great future, be full of hope, and embrace the ambition of building a strong socialist country and further realizing communism. With great ideals, there will be great perseverance and courage, and it will be possible to always maintain soaring revolutionary vigor and move from one victory to another. Secondly, it is necessary to vigorously promote and publicize the communist attitude towards labor among the youth. "Work without conditions, labor without compensation," "Wherever the Party points, go there," and "Consciously undertake the most difficult tasks," this communist attitude towards labor is a powerful factor in promoting the continuous leap forward of socialist construction, and it is also a necessary ideological condition for gradually transitioning to communism. League committees at all levels should further promote this revolutionary spirit so that it becomes more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and becomes a more conscious action of the broad masses of youth. Third, it is necessary to continue to promote the communist spirit of cooperation among the youth. Our cause is a great cause of collectivism, requiring the unity of millions of people, with one heart and one mind, mutual assistance and cooperation. "Give convenience to others, leave difficulties to yourself," "Go forward when you see difficulties, give way when you see honors, learn when you see advanced elements, and help when you see backward elements," these behaviors, shining with communist light, fully embody the noble qualities of the working class of our country. It is necessary to educate the youth to strive to learn and inherit this revolutionary quality and promote and carry forward the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and class friendship. The plenary session believes that as long as the youth of our country further establish communist ambitions, establish a communist attitude towards labor, and promote the communist spirit of cooperation, they will surely be able to make greater contributions to the cause of socialism and communism, and temper themselves into staunch successors to the communist cause.

In the entire ideological education work of the Communist Youth League, "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" is a principle that must be adhered to for a long time. Socialist society is a social form transitioning from capitalism to communism. It has established socialist public ownership, realized the high-speed development of a planned economy, and continuously promoted the growth and expansion of communist factors. On the other hand, it still has traces of capitalism in the economic and ideological fields. The political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and the habits of the petty bourgeoisie will take a long time to overcome.Therefore, in socialist society, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the socialist road, is bound to be long-term and sometimes very fierce. We must continuously strengthen the class education of the youth and help them to firmly establish the proletarian stand and learn the method of class analysis. Only by carrying the socialist political and ideological revolution through to the end, resolutely eliminating bourgeois ideology, and thoroughly criticizing modern revisionism can communist ideology be firmly established.

Vigorously organizing the youth to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works has great and far-reaching significance for the socialist and communist cause of our country and for the healthy growth of the youth of our country. Mao Zedong Thought is a model of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the revolution, and it is the guideline for our country to victoriously carry out the revolution and socialist construction. In recent months, under the direct leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the movement for the youth of the whole country to study Mao Zedong's works has rapidly formed a mass learning upsurge on a national scale. This is a popularization movement of Marxism-Leninism. It is a concentrated manifestation of the great improvement of the political and ideological consciousness of the people and youth of our country. Once this learning movement is launched, it will more forcefully improve the class consciousness of the broad masses of people and youth, promote the communist spirit, promote the technical revolution, and become a powerful driving force for promoting the socialist political and ideological revolution and high-speed construction of socialism.

The Communist Youth League should wholeheartedly support the strong demands of the broad masses of youth to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, and actively promote the more extensive and in-depth development of this learning movement. It is necessary to resolutely criticize the bourgeois viewpoints that despise and ridicule workers, peasants, and students for learning theory. Facts have proved that, due to the class status of workers and peasants and their direct participation in social production, they can not only learn Marxism-Leninism, but also learn it well and use it well. In recent years, the cultural level of the youth of our country has been improved to a certain extent, which has also created favorable conditions for learning theory. League committees at all levels should carry out a series of down-to-earth work, actively lead, and comprehensively plan. In terms of learning methods, it is necessary to implement the principle of linking theory with practice, combining the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works with understanding the international and domestic situation, implementing the Party's line and policies, completing the Party's central tasks, and strengthening communist ideological education, and learn to use the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoints, and methods to understand the world, transform the world, and further transform oneself. In organizing learning, league committees at all levels should pay special attention to the learning of grassroots league cadres and activists. They have a higher level of political consciousness and the strongest desire to learn, and the Party needs them to play a greater role among the masses. Their good learning is an important link in ensuring that the entire learning movement achieves results. For all young people with self-study ability, they must be educated to study hard, diligently, and persistently with an indomitable spirit; at the same time, their guidance and assistance should be strengthened. Accumulating over time and gradually improving, a reserve force for theoretical work will inevitably grow out of them. The youth of our country will also surely become a new generation with Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation.

At present, the upsurge of the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement that has been set off nationwide has great political and economic significance. It not only provides an important guarantee for completing this year's national economic plan and realizing continuous leaps forward in the future, but also opens up broad avenues for our country to realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture at high speed. The league organizations at all levels should take active action, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, widely establish models, and widely insert red flags, carry out the revolutionary competition of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," and lead the broad masses of youth to become the most active and courageous shock forces. Whether in industry and agriculture, commerce and transportation, or in the production and service sectors, the youth should concentrate their efforts, seize the center, vigorously engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization, and change all manual operations that should be changed into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. At the same time, according to the different situations and needs of various industries, it is also necessary to continuously expand the results and carry out comprehensive innovation. In industry, it is necessary to vigorously promote automation and semi-automation, promote new technologies and advanced experiences, and study the comprehensive utilization of resources and raw materials. In agriculture, taking the realization of mechanization, water conservancy, electrification, and the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture as the guiding principle, carry out various scientific and technological experimental activities. The league organizations on all fronts must encourage the youth to strive to master cutting-edge technologies, climb the peaks of science, and the process of carrying out the technical revolution is also a process of ideological revolution. In the movement, it is often filled with the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, and between advanced ideology and backward ideology. Therefore, it is necessary to educate the youth to continue to break superstitions, liberate their minds, promote the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, actively implement the principle of combining indigenous methods with foreign methods and self-reliance, study hard, persevere in experiments, create boldly, and continuously revolutionize and implement to the end with the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties or failure. Countless facts have proved that only with red thinking can there be red innovation; only with red innovation can there be red production. The plenary session warmly hopes that the broad masses of youth in our country, in order to realize our great goal of building a strong socialist country, will bravely carry out innovation and creation, and together with the people of the whole country, strive to complete the technical transformation of our country's industry and agriculture in a not too long period of time, and be able to reach the world's advanced level in all important aspects of science and technology.

In order to promote the development of the technical revolution and socialist construction, the Communist Youth League should continue to actively carry out the mass cultural learning movement with an indomitable spirit, and strive to run spare-time schools well. It is necessary to regard eliminating illiteracy and popularizing spare-time primary schools as a battle, eliminating one batch, upgrading one batch, and doing it in one go, striving for the vast majority of youth in our country to gradually reach at least the level of higher primary school, and actively helping youth with higher primary school and middle school education to continue to enter spare-time middle schools and spare-time universities for further study.

The plenary session believes that realizing the continued comprehensive leap forward in agriculture this year is a major event in which the Communist Youth League should make special efforts. Agriculture is the foundation of the entire national economy. Only by ensuring the continuous large-scale increase in agricultural production can we powerfully promote the high-speed advancement of industry and other construction undertakings, strengthen the material foundation of the people's communes, and further improve the living standards of the people of our country. League committees at all levels and the League organizations of the people's communes must do everything possible to mobilize the broad masses of youth to continue to promote the heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, and immediately invest in the battle of spring plowing and spring sowing and strive for a bumper summer harvest. The rural youth throughout the country must make completing this year's grain and cotton production increase plan as the most important shock direction, actively participate in the activities of high-yield squares and high-yield fields, and further launch a large-scale high-yield competition upsurge. Carry out land reclamation activities, increase the multiple cropping index, effectively transform low-yield fields, and resolutely implement the Party's policy of simultaneously increasing the output per unit area and expanding the planting area. It is necessary to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, regard pig raising as a glorious and great task, love animal husbandry, and wholeheartedly raise pigs and other livestock as many, as fast, as fat, and as strong as possible, in order to implement the Party's policy of attaching equal importance to planting and animal husbandry. While rushing to ensure the summer harvest and spring sowing, it is necessary to widely mobilize young people to use scattered marginal land to grow more oil crops. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, several larger-scale afforestation movements should be organized within this year. The League's work in fisheries and sideline industries must also be actively and reasonably arranged to implement the Party's policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified management. Seizing a large-scale agricultural bumper harvest is a common glorious task of the people and youth of the whole country. Among the urban youth, an activity to support agriculture should be widely launched, contributing the greatest strength to the realization of the 1960 agricultural bumper harvest and the promotion of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification.

In order to victoriously complete the glorious tasks of 1960, it is necessary to better give play to the Communist Youth League's core role among the youth. The plenary session believes that it is necessary to continue to improve the grassroots organizations, strengthen the education of League members, and, in accordance with the League Constitution, require them to better play an exemplary role in work and study. Furthermore, it is necessary to actively admit a group of young people who meet the conditions for League membership into the League in order to continuously increase new blood and enhance the League's combat effectiveness. The League's cadres must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, always maintain full revolutionary vigor, continue to implement the Party's General Line and the principle of vigorously launching mass movements, and at the same time, promote the spirit of learning, cultivate the spirit of diligent learning and painstaking research, and strive to improve the political and ideological level. Resolutely listening to the Party's words and ensuring the Party's absolute leadership over the League is the most fundamental key to the cause of the Communist Youth League. League committees at all levels must continue to implement the principle of giving priority to the leadership of the Party committee at the same level, regard the Party's central work as the League's central work, actively carry out the League's activities, and guide the youth to launch a greater upsurge of labor and learning, and strive to realize a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    用毛泽东思想武装全国青年在技术革命中发挥突击作用
    共青团三届六中全会发表公报确定当前全团中心任务
    新华社10日讯　中国共产主义青年团第三届中央委员会第六次全体会议公报：中国共产主义青年团第三届中央委员会第六次全体会议，于1960年2月27日到3月4日在北京举行。出席会议的有中央委员和候补中央委员一百零六人，列席会议的有团的省、市、自治区和地、县委负责干部七十六人。全会在党中央的亲切关怀和直接领导下，总结了1959年的工作，讨论了我国社会主义建设的形势，决定了1960年全团的工作任务。全会还增选了团中央常务委员会委员和书记处书记。
    全会认为，我国社会主义建设的形势空前良好。在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲精神的鼓舞下，全国人民紧密团结，万众一心，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，超额完成了1959年的国民经济计划，提前三年实现了第二个五年计划的主要指标。现在，我国人民建设社会主义的积极性更加高涨，群众运动的规模更加广大，一个气象万千的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在各个战线上猛烈地开展。我国的社会主义建设进入了一个又高速度又按比例连续跃进的新阶段。在全民大跃进中，各级共青团组织坚决地保证了党的领导，坚持了青年运动的共产主义方向和大搞群众运动的方针，因而在工作中取得了巨大的成绩。团的干部的政治思想水平和工作水平，也有了显著的提高。经过实际斗争的锻炼和社会主义教育运动，总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三大法宝在青年思想中生了根，广大青年树立了共产主义的雄心壮志，集体主义精神大提高，共产主义风格大发扬，更加热爱党、热爱毛主席，更加深刻地认识到毛泽东思想是战无不胜、攻无不克的锐利武器。他们在各个战线上英勇地创造性地劳动，为祖国作出了出色的贡献。我国青年这种高尚的精神面貌，标志着共产主义思想的新高涨。这是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，是党和毛主席英明领导的结果。全会认为，当前全团的中心任务是：在党的密切领导下，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，继续加强青年的共产主义思想教育，更大地提高全团和全国青年的共产主义觉悟；大力开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众性的增产节约运动，为实现1960年社会主义建设更好更全面的跃进而英勇奋斗。
    继续加强共产主义思想教育，更大地提高我国青年的共产主义觉悟，是关系到如何更好地发挥青年在社会主义建设中的突击作用的核心问题，也是把青年培养成为共产主义的接班人的根本问题。全会认为，在当前的共产主义思想教育中，首先，要大力进行革命理想的教育，帮助青年进一步树立共产主义的雄心壮志。应当以不断革命的思想教育青年，要求他们充分认清当前的形势，充满信心，脚踏实地，把当前的建设事业搞好；同时还要充分认识到伟大的未来，满怀希望，抱定建立社会主义强国和进一步实现共产主义的雄心壮志。有了伟大的理想就会产生伟大的毅力和勇气，就能够永远保持冲天的革命干劲，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。其次，要在青年中大力提倡和宣传共产主义的劳动态度。“工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬”，“党指向哪里，就奔向那里”，“自觉地承担最困难的任务”，这种共产主义的劳动态度，是促进社会主义建设连续跃进的强大因素，也是逐步过渡到共产主义的必要的思想条件。各级团委应当进一步宣扬这种革命精神，使它更加深入人心，成为广大青年更加自觉的行动。第三，要在青年中继续发扬共产主义的协作精神。我们的事业是伟大的集体主义的事业，需要千百万人同心同德，团结互助。“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”，“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”，这些闪烁着共产主义光芒的行为，充分体现了我国工人阶级的高贵品质。应当教育青年努力学习和继承这种革命的品质，把团结互助、阶级友爱的精神，加以发扬光大。全会相信，只要我国青年进一步树立共产主义的雄心壮志，建立共产主义的劳动态度，发扬共产主义的协作精神，就一定能够在社会主义共产主义的事业中做出更大的贡献，把自己锻炼成为坚强的共产主义接班人。
    在共青团的整个思想教育工作中，“兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想”，是必须长期坚持的方针。社会主义社会是一个从资本主义向共产主义过渡的社会形态，它建立了社会主义的公有制，实现了计划经济的高速发展，不断促进共产主义因素的生长壮大，另一方面，它在经济上和意识形态上都还存在着资本主义遗留的痕迹。资产阶级的政治思想影响和小资产阶级的习惯势力，还需要很长时间才能克服。因此，在社会主义社会里，无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的阶级斗争，必然是长期的，有时还是很激烈的。我们必须不断地加强青年的阶级教育，帮助他们坚定无产阶级的立场，学会阶级分析的方法。只有把社会主义的政治思想革命进行到底，坚决清除资产阶级思想和彻底批判现代修正主义，才能把共产主义思想巩固地树立起来。
    大力组织青年学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作，对于我国的社会主义共产主义事业，对于我国青年的健全成长，都具有伟大的深远的意义。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同革命具体实践相结合的典范，是我国胜利地进行革命和社会主义建设的指针。最近几个月来，在各级党委的直接领导下，全国青年学习毛泽东著作运动，已经迅速形成全国规模的群众性的学习热潮。这是一个马克思列宁主义的普及运动。它是我国人民和青年政治思想觉悟大提高的集中表现。这个学习运动一经开展，就更加有力地提高了广大人民和青年的阶级觉悟，发扬了共产主义精神，促进了技术革命，成为推动社会主义政治思想革命和高速度建设社会主义的强大动力。
    共青团应当满腔热情地支持广大青年学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的强烈要求，积极促进这一学习运动更加广泛更加深入地发展。必须坚决地批判那种轻视和讥笑工农学理论的资产阶级观点。事实证明，由于工农的阶级地位和直接参加社会生产，他们不但能够学马克思列宁主义，并且能够学得好和用得好。几年来我国青年文化水平已有了一定程度的提高，这也为学习理论创造了良好的条件。各级团委都应当进行一系列踏踏实实的工作，积极领导，全面规划。在学习的方法上，应当贯彻理论联系实际的原则，把学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作同认识国际国内形势、贯彻执行党的路线政策，同完成党的中心任务、加强共产主义思想教育结合起来，学会用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，来认识世界，改造世界，并且进一步改造自己。在组织学习中，各级团委应当特别抓紧团的基层干部和积极分子的学习。他们政治觉悟水平较高，学习的要求也最强烈，党需要他们在群众中发挥更大的作用。他们学习得好，是保证整个学习运动获得成效的重要环节。对一切有自学能力的青年，要教育他们以坚韧不拔的精神，下苦功夫，勤学苦钻，坚持到底；同时要加强对他们的辅导和帮助。这样日积月累，逐步提高，从他们当中就必然会生长出一批理论工作的后备力量。我国青年也一定会成为具有马克思列宁主义理论修养的新的一代。
    目前，在全国范围内掀起的全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮，具有极大的政治意义和经济意义。它不仅为完成今年的国民经济计划和实现今后的连续跃进提供了重要的保证，而且也为我国高速度地实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，开辟了广阔的途径。各级团的组织应当积极行动起来，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，广树标兵，大插红旗，开展“学、比、赶、帮”的革命竞赛，带领广大青年成为最活跃、最勇敢的突击力量。无论工业和农业，商业和运输业，也无论生产部门和服务部门的青年，都要集中精力，抓住中心，大搞机械化、半机械化，使一切应当改变的手工操作通通改变为机械化、半机械化操作。同时，根据各行业的不同情况和需要，还要不断扩大战果，进行全面革新。在工业方面，要大搞自动化、半自动化，推广新技术和先进经验，研究资源和原材料的综合利用。在农业方面，以实现机械化、水利化、电气化和贯彻农业八字宪法为纲，开展各种科学技术试验活动。各个战线的团组织，都要鼓舞青年努力掌握尖端技术，攀登科学高峰，开展技术革命的过程，也是一个思想革命的过程。在运动中，往往充满着无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想、先进思想同落后思想的斗争。因此必须教育青年，继续破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，积极贯彻土洋并举、自力更生的方针，刻苦学习，顽强试验，大胆创造，以不怕困难不怕失败的精神，不断革命，贯彻始终。无数的事实证明，只有思想红、才能革新红；只有革新红，才能生产红。全会热烈希望，我国广大青年，为了实现我们建设社会主义强国的伟大目标，勇敢地进行革新和创造，同全国人民一起，争取在一个不太长的时间内，完成我国工业和农业的技术改造，并在科学技术领域的一切重要方面，都能够达到世界先进水平。
    为了推进技术革命和社会主义建设事业的发展，共青团应当继续以坚韧不拔的精神，积极开展群众的文化学习运动，努力办好业余学校。要把扫除文盲和普及业余小学当作一个战役，扫除一批，升级一批，一鼓作气，争取我国绝大多数青年逐步地首先都达到高小水平，并且积极帮助具有高小、中学程度的青年，继续进入业余中学和业余高等学校学习。
    全会认为，实现今年农业的继续全面跃进，是共青团应当特别出力的大事。农业是整个国民经济的基础，只有保证农业不断大增产，才可以有力地推动工业和其它各项建设事业高速度地前进，加强人民公社的物质基础，进一步提高我国人民的生活水平。各级团委和人民公社团的组织，必须千方百计地动员广大青年，继续发扬英勇顽强的战斗精神，立即投入春耕春种和争取夏季大丰收的战斗。全国农村青年，都要把完成今年的粮、棉增产计划做为最主要的突击方向，积极地参加丰产方和丰产田的活动，进一步掀起大面积的丰产竞赛热潮。开展垦荒活动，提高复种指数，切实地改造低产田，坚决贯彻执行党的提高单位面积产量和扩大种植面积同时并举的方针。要坚决遵照毛主席的指示，把养猪事业看做是一项光荣伟大的任务，热爱畜牧业，满腔热情地把猪和其它牲畜养得又多又快又肥又壮，以贯彻执行党的种植业和畜牧业并重的方针。在突击保夏收、保春播的同时，要广泛发动青少年利用零星边沿土地，大种油料作物。在今年之内在党和政府的领导下，要组织几次规模较大的造林运动。对渔业、副业各方面团的工作，也须积极作出合理的安排，贯彻执行党的以粮为纲、发展多种经营的方针。夺取农业大丰产是全国人民和青年共同的光荣的任务，在城市青年中，应当广泛地开展一个支援农业的活动，为实现1960年的农业大丰产和促进农业的机械化、水利化、电气化，贡献出最大的力量。
    为了胜利地完成1960年的光荣任务，必须更好地发挥共青团在青年中的核心作用。全会认为，应当继续健全基层组织，加强团员教育，根据团章，要求他们在工作和学习中更好地发挥模范作用。并且应当积极接收一批合乎团员条件的青年入团，以不断增加新的血液，增强团的战斗力。团的干部必须用毛泽东思想武装自己，永远保持充沛的革命干劲，继续贯彻执行党的总路线和大搞群众运动的方针，同时要大兴学习之风，养成勤奋学习、刻苦钻研的精神，努力提高政治思想水平。坚决听党的话，保证党对团的绝对领导，是共青团事业中最根本的关键。各级团委必须继续贯彻执行以同级党委领导为主的原则，把党的中心工作当作团的中心工作，积极开展团的活动，引导青年掀起更大的劳动和学习热潮，为实现1960年更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。
