Xinhua News Agency, New York: Laurence Gandar, editor of the South African "Rand Daily Mail," recently wrote after a two-month visit to the United States that the discrimination and persecution of colored people in the United States is no less than that of the racially discriminatory Union of South Africa, which is notorious for its racial discrimination.

Gandar wrote that for an observer like himself, coming from racially discriminatory South Africa, "the extent of racial discrimination in the United States is (also) unexpected." He said, "There are a total of 18 million blacks and more than a dozen smaller ethnic groups in the United States. All of these people are subjected to various forms and degrees of discrimination, some of which are very vicious."

Gandar continued, "Another unexpected fact is the striking similarity in the nature of racial prejudice in the United States and South Africa." For example: "Both countries are equally stubbornly convinced that blacks are inherently inferior," "Both countries are equally consciously disregarding the achievements of blacks," "Both countries are equally resistant to the political and economic progress of blacks," officials and police in both countries carry out equally "rude and even brutal" persecution of blacks, "Both countries equally put forward an argument that blacks are basically content with their lives, and that dissatisfaction is stirred up by meddling agitators," and so on.

Gandar said that the United States' "naked" racial discrimination is "indefensible."

    南非一报纸编辑访问美国后发现
    北美南非半斤八两种族歧视同样盛行
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：南非“兰德每日邮报”编辑劳伦斯·甘达尔最近在美国访问了两个月以后写道：美国对国内有色人种的歧视和迫害绝不亚于以种族歧视而臭名远扬的南非联邦。
    甘达尔写道，对于一个像他这样来自盛行种族歧视的南非的观察家来说，“美国种族歧视的程度（也）是出乎意外的”。他说，“在美国共有一千八百万黑人以及十多个较小的民族集体。所有这些人都受到各种形式的和各种程度的歧视，有些歧视是非常恶毒的。”
    甘达尔继续写道，“另一个出乎意外的事实是，美国和南非两国种族偏见的性质惊人的相似”。例如：“两国同样死硬不变地认为黑人是天生的次等人”，“两国同样有意识地漠视黑人的成就”，“两国同样抗拒黑人在政治上和经济上的进展”，两国的官员和警察对黑人进行同样“粗鲁甚至残暴”的迫害，“两国同样提出一种论据说，黑人基本上对于他们的生活是心满意足的，不满意的情绪是多管闲事的鼓动者所挑起来的”等等。
    甘达尔说，美国“这种以赤裸裸的面目出现的”种族歧视是“无法辩解的”。
