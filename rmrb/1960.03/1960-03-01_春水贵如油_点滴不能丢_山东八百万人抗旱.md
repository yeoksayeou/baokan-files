Spring Water is as Precious as Oil; Not a Single Drop Can Be Wasted
Eight Million People in Shandong Fight Drought

(Reported by our newspaper) Eight million people in various parts of Shandong are stepping up their efforts to prevent and combat drought to ensure timely planting and strive for a bumper summer harvest.

Since the Spring Festival, Shandong Province has had little rain and snow, strong spring winds, and high temperatures, resulting in rapid moisture loss from the soil, with drought conditions already occurring in some areas. In response, people's communes in various places have quickly mobilized forces and adopted the method of using "five groups" and "six water sources" simultaneously to rush irrigation of spring fields. The "five groups" are machinery groups, waterwheel groups, water dipper groups, windlass groups, and carrying pole and bucket groups; the "six water sources" are fully utilizing rivers, reservoirs, canals, wells, springs, and pools. Rivers everywhere have opened their gates, reservoirs are releasing water, machinery is in full swing, and there is a lively scene of waterwheels and people working. More than 30 million mu of wheat across the province has been irrigated with reviving water, a fourteen-fold increase compared to the same period last year; over 2 million mu of spring barren land has been irrigated. Wheat in twelve counties and cities, including Shou'zhang, Changyi, Penglai, Linqing, Liaocheng, and Pingyuan, has been basically irrigated once over, with Liaocheng Prefecture making the fastest progress, having irrigated 82% of its wheat by February 17. Linqing City has irrigated all 530,000 mu of wheat once and has pre-irrigated 500,000 mu of its 560,000 mu of cotton fields. Areas such as Jining, Changwei, Linyi, and Jinan, which were previously considered dead spots in last year's drought resistance efforts, have now turned tens of thousands of mu into irrigation areas with dual insurance of wells and canals.

While carrying out spring irrigation at full speed, various places have also divided into three teams: one is to seize the time to repair field projects and implement engineering support; one is to develop new water sources to expand the irrigated area; and one is to rush the manufacture of water lifting tools. Since the Spring Festival, on the basis of winter water conservancy construction, various places have repaired more than 14,000 li of field irrigation canals and more than 16,000 buildings, leveled the ground, and repaired more than 10 million mu of ridges, so that most of the newly built projects are matched. More than 4,800 small reservoirs, ponds, dams, and pools have been newly built, and 11,000 wells have been dug, expanding the irrigated area by 1.9 million mu and improving the irrigated area by 640,000 mu. Some areas lacking water sources have concentrated their efforts to dig out water for irrigation while repairing. Various places have also paid special attention to the work of repairing and manufacturing water lifting tools. Damaged waterwheels and irrigation and drainage machinery in Yantai Prefecture have been basically repaired. More than 100,000 new water tools have been manufactured throughout the province since the Spring Festival.

In order to quickly overcome the spring drought and allow wheat to develop normally, many areas have broken with conventions and rushed to irrigate the land. The Weizi Commune in Changyi divided the commune's personnel into three professional teams: water lifting, gravity flow, and mechanical, to irrigate water in shifts day and night, stopping people but not tools, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. The communes along the Yellow (River) in Qihe built more than 600 battle sheds on the main canals, with crowds of people during the day and lanterns and torches rushing to irrigate at night. In the drought resistance struggle, extensive cooperation has also been carried out to help weak areas advance into dead spots. The Houmiao Commune in Shou'zhang County organized 78 advanced teams with 746 laborers, carrying 1,780 waterwheels to help 34 small teams lacking water sources and waterwheel tools, so that the daily irrigated area of the entire commune increased from 1,600 mu to 6,000 mu.

Areas where drought has not yet occurred are also striving to take the initiative and seize the time to prevent drought, adopting methods such as plowing, harrowing, rolling, crushing (clods), and hoeing to rush to conserve soil moisture in spring fields. At present, more than 60% of spring land has been plowed and harrowed throughout the province, with many areas reaching three to four harrowings, and five to six harrowings for high-yield fields. Wheat fields that have already been irrigated have also been hoed and harrowed to loosen the soil and conserve moisture.

    春水贵如油　点滴不能丢
    山东八百万人抗旱
    本报讯　山东各地八百多万人加紧防旱、抗旱，确保适时播种，争取夏季丰收。
    春节后，山东省雨雪较少，春风大，气温高，土地跑墒较快，部分地区已发生旱象。针对这种情况，各地人民公社迅速调集力量，并采取“五群”、“六水”齐用的办法赶浇春田。“五群”是机械群、水车群、水斗群、辘轳群、鸳鸯罐群；“六水”是把河、库、渠、井、泉、汪等水源都充分利用起来。各地河河开闸，库库放水，机具齐动，机器轰鸣，车水马龙，全省已有三千多万亩小麦灌了返青水，比去年同期增加十四倍；灌春白地二百多万亩。寿张、昌邑、蓬莱、临清、聊城、平原等十二个县市的小麦已基本普浇一遍，进度最快的聊城专区到2月17日止已浇麦82％。临清市五十三万亩小麦已普浇一遍，五十六万亩棉田，已灌播前水五十万亩。在去年抗旱中还是死角的济宁、昌潍、临沂、济南等地区，今春已有数十万亩变为井渠并用双保险的灌区。
    在突击进行春灌的同时，各地还分出三支人马，一支是抓紧整修田间工程实行工程配套；一支是开辟新水源扩大浇地面积；一支是赶制提水工具。春节后，各地在冬修水利的基础上，又整修田间灌溉渠道一万四千多华里；建筑物一万六千多座，平整地面整修畦田一千多万亩，使新修工程大都配起套来。新建小型水库、塘、坝、水池等四千八百多个，打井一万一千多眼，扩大灌溉面积一百九十万亩，改善灌溉面积六十四万亩。有些缺乏水源的地区，经过集中力量边修边用，很快挖出水来浇地。各地修制提水工具的工作也抓的特别紧。烟台专区损坏的水车、排灌机械，都已基本修好。全省在春节后制造新水具达十万多件。
    为了迅速战胜春旱，让小麦正常发育，很多地区都打破常规，突击浇地。昌邑围子公社把全社人马分为提水、自流、机械三个专业队，昼夜分班灌水，歇人不歇工具，工效提高两倍多。齐河沿黄（河）各公社在干渠上搭起六百多个战棚，白天人山人海，夜晚灯笼火把突击浇地。在抗旱斗争中，还广泛地开展了大协作，帮助薄弱地区向死角进军。寿张县后庙公社有七十八个先进小队组织了七百四十六名劳力，携带了一千七百八十部水车帮助三十四个缺乏水源和车水工具的小队，使全社每日浇地面积由一千六百亩增加到六千亩。
    目前还没有发生旱象的地区，也都争取主动，抓紧防旱，采取耕、耙、耢、轧、打（坷垃）、锄等办法，突击进行春田保墒。现在全省已耕耙春地60％以上，许多地区达到普耙三至四遍，丰产田五至六遍，已经浇过的麦田，也锄耙一遍松土保墒。
