The Work of the Service Worker Moved My Family
　　Resident of Shangxin Street, Chongqing City, Dai Shujun

　　I am fifty-nine years old this year. My son and daughter both work outside, and I am the only one at home. On February 26th of this year, I suddenly fell ill. I went down the street to see a doctor, and when I reached the door of Wang Huizhen's house, I was so tired and weak that I couldn't walk any further. Wang Huizhen is a service worker in our residential section. When she saw how sick I was, she immediately helped me to bed and also ran to the street to fetch a doctor, who gave me an injection and medicine. I was afraid that my illness would infect others, so I insisted on going home. Wang Huizhen said that the wind on the mountain was strong, and it was far from the street, making it inconvenient to see a doctor. She sincerely and earnestly insisted I stay at her home to recover. I stayed at Wang Huizhen's house for more than twenty days. She took care of me day and night, giving me water, medicine, going to the street to buy food, and even personally feeding me congee. Wang Huizhen is very busy with her work in the area. When she was not at home, the sixty-one-year-old Zhao Sucheng from next door came to take care of me, and her grandson, Zhao Jiucheng, brought me meals and water for washing my face every day. The shop assistants at the Shangxin Street store, knowing that I was sick, also sent me lotus root starch, sago, and white sugar several times. My illness slowly improved. By the time my daughter rushed back from out of town, I was already able to get out of bed. When my daughter saw how enthusiastic the service workers in the area were, she was truly moved! She said to me that we must work even harder in our posts and repay the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao with practical actions.

    服务员的工作感动了我一家
    重庆市上新街居民　戴淑君
    我今年五十九岁了，我的孩子和女儿都在外边工作，家里只我一个人。今年2月26日我忽然病了，我下尕去街上看病，走到王惠贞家的门口，累得手足无力，再也走不动了。王惠贞是我们居民段的服务员，一见我病得这么凶，她马上扶我上床睡，还跑上街请来医生，给我打针服药。我怕病会传染别人，一定要回家。王惠贞说，山上风大，离街又远，看病不方便，诚心诚意地留我在她家里治病。我一连在王惠贞家住了二十多天。她日夜照顾我喝水、吃药，上街买食品，还亲自喂我吃稀饭。王惠贞担任地段上的工作很忙，她不在家时，隔壁六十一岁的赵素澄老太婆就来照料我，天天还差她的孙子赵久承给我送饭、送洗脸水。上新街商店售货员晓得我病了，也几次送来藕粉、西米、白糖。我的病慢慢好了。等我的女儿从外地赶来时，我已能起床了。女儿见到段上服务员这般热情，真感动得很啦！她对我说，只有在工作岗位上更好地工作，用实际行动报答党和毛主席的恩情。
