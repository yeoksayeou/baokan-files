(Reported by this newspaper) Harbin Rubber Factory has launched a major technical innovation in enterprise management. Recently, they created a streamlined production management accounting assembly line, achieving accounting without using pens. The economic impact of the entire factory's production leap forward can be announced to the entire factory on the same day, making it easier for workers to participate in management.

This factory's streamlined production management accounting assembly line is composed of ten simplified accounting tools, including an automatic adder, a simple rapid calculator, an electric conversion table, and an electric production progress table, jointly created by technicians, workers, and cadres. It can reflect the completion of the factory's production every hour. The economic impact of the entire factory's day can also be quickly and accurately calculated on the same day and promptly announced to all employees of the factory.

With the development of the mass movement for technical innovation and technical revolution, the factory's production has rapidly increased, and enterprise management work has not kept pace with the needs of production development. Often, because the production results cannot be reflected in time, and production preparation work cannot keep up, the organization of production appears to be insufficient. Statistician Wang Qinsheng and workers, with the assistance of the electrician school, created an adder. Checking statisticians do not need pens, paper, or abacuses. They only need to put the products into a specially designed small wooden box under the adder. The products flow out from the inclined plate inside the box, and the adder automatically records and reflects the numbers.

According to the numbers reflected on the adder, the statistician reports the production completion situation to the work sections and workshops every hour through the "automatic reporting device" by pressing the buttons on the automatic reporting device like making a phone call. Workshop accountants use the same method to reflect the workshop's production situation to the factory's specially set-up electric production indicator table, and at the same time, announce it to the employees through the workshop's electric production progress table. In this way, the factory's leaders and workers can simultaneously know the workshop's hourly output completion situation. In the past, the group and work section's worker accountants had to spend about an hour to calculate the completion of the four major economic indicators (output, quality, attendance rate, raw material consumption), and sometimes errors occurred; now, with the simple rapid calculator, the results can be calculated within a few minutes. Similarly, the workshop accountant can quickly calculate the workshop's economic indicators for the day through the "electric conversion table" and announce them to the workshop employees through the "three highs and one low" daily report board (high output, high quality, high efficiency, low cost).

After the realization of the streamlined production management accounting assembly line, the situation of analyzing plans every seven days by groups and analyzing plans every month by workshops in the past has been completely changed, so that all workers and leading cadres in the factory can have a clear understanding every day. It has greatly enhanced the concept of comprehensively completing the plan and the idea of economic accounting among all employees in the factory. At the same time, it has also facilitated the participation of workers in management, enabling some workers who participate in enterprise management work to get rid of the tedious accounting affairs. They do not need to spend a lot of time every day to finish the accounting work they are responsible for. Therefore, they can participate in cultural learning and other spare-time activities with other workers. Because the accounting tools are simple and easy to understand, and everyone can master them, it has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of workers to participate in enterprise management.

    哈尔滨橡胶厂创造核算简化流水线
    全厂生产的经济效果当天就能准确地计算出来
    本报讯　哈尔滨橡胶厂在企业管理方面大闹技术革新，最近创造了一条生产管理核算简化流水线，做到核算不用笔，当天就可以把全厂生产大跃进的经济效果向全厂公布，更便于工人参加管理工作。
    这个厂的生产管理核算简化流水线，是由技术人员、工人和干部共同创造的自动加数器、简易速算器、电动换算台、电动生产时进度台等十种简化核算工具组成的。它可以按小时反映全厂生产完成情况。全厂一天的经济效果也能在当天迅速、准确地计算出来，并及时在全厂职工中公布。
    随着技术革新和技术革命群众运动的发展，这个厂生产迅速增加，企业管理工作跟不上生产发展的需要，常常因为生产效果不能及时反映，生产准备工作跟不上去，组织生产显得不够有力。统计员王勤生和工人一起，在电工学校协助下，创造一种加数器。检查统计员不用笔、纸和算盘，只要把产品往加数器下特设的小木箱里一放，产品从箱内斜板上流出来，加数器上就自动地记录并反映出数字来。
    统计员根据加数器上反映出的数字，每小时通过“自动报数器”，像打电话一样按动自动报数器上的电钮，把生产完成情况汇报给工段和车间。车间核算员用同样办法，把车间生产情况反映到厂部特设的生产电动指示台上，并同时通过车间电动生产时进度台，公布给职工。这样，厂的领导干部和工人就同时都可以知道车间每小时产量完成情况。过去小组和工段的工人核算员核算一次四大经济指标（产量、质量、出勤率、原材料消耗）完成情况，得一小时左右，有时还发生差错；现在使用简易速算器一拉，几分钟内，就可以核算出结果来。同样，车间核算员通过“电动换算台”又能很快的核算出当天车间的经济指标，并通过三高一低日报板（高产、高质、高效率、低成本）向车间职工公布。
    生产管理核算简化流水线实现后，彻底改变了过去小组七天一分析计划和车间一月一分析计划的状况，使全厂的工人和领导干部都能天天心中有数。大大增强了全厂职工全面完成计划的观念和经济核算思想。同时，也便利了工人参加管理，使一部分参加企业管理工作的工人，摆脱了繁琐的核算事务，他们每天不用花很多时间，就可以结束所担任的核算工作，因此，他们可以和其他工人一起参加文化学习和其他业余活动。由于核算工具简单易懂，人人都能掌握，大大激发了工人参加企业管理的积极性。（附图片）
