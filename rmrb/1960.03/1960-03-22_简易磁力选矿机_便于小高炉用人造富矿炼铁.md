Simple Magnetic Separator
Facilitating the Use of Artificial Rich Ore for Iron Smelting in Small Blast Furnaces

    Workers at the Yueyang Iron and Steel Plant in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, have created a simple electric magnetic separator made of iron and wood, which greatly saves labor in ore dressing and makes it possible to use artificial rich ore for iron smelting in small blast furnaces.

    This machine requires only one operator and can select 70 to 80 tons of concentrate per day, with the selected ore grade reaching about 60 percent. Because the ore is magnetically separated, increasing its grade, the plant's blast furnace utilization coefficient has increased from the original 0.8 to 4.4, and the qualified rate of pig iron has increased from the original 80 percent to 100 percent. The cost of smelting one ton of iron has also decreased from the original 180 yuan to 135 yuan.

    简易磁力选矿机
    便于小高炉用人造富矿炼铁
    湖南省岳阳县岳阳钢铁厂职工制成一部电动的铁木结构简易磁力选矿机，大大节约了选矿劳力，实现了小高炉用人造富矿炼铁。
    这部机器只需要一个人操作，每天可选精矿七十到八十吨，选出的矿石品位达到百分之六十左右。由于矿石经过磁选，提高了品位，全厂高炉利用系数由原来的零·八提高到四·四，生铁合格率由原来的百分之八十提高到百分之一百，每炼一吨铁的成本也由原来的一百八十元降到一百三十五元。
