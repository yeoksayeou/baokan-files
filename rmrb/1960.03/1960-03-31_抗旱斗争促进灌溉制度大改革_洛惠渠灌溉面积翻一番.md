    Anti-Drought Struggle Promotes Major Reform of Irrigation System
    Irrigation Area of Luo-Hui Canal Doubles
    (Our Report) The Luo-Hui Canal Irrigation Area in Shaanxi Province, guided by the dialectical law that things transform into their opposites under certain conditions, has improved its irrigation technology in the face of severe difficulties such as the continuous development of drought and a 50% reduction in canal water. This has not only saved water and expanded the irrigated area, but has also further grasped the laws of scientific water use, pushing irrigation work to a new stage. During this year's spring irrigation, the irrigated area per cubic meter per second of water per day increased from about 1,200 mu during last year's winter irrigation to about 2,400 mu, and the irrigation quality was also improved. The total number of mu irrigated in the entire irrigation area during the spring irrigation increased by 1.3 times compared to the same period last year.
    The Luo-Hui Canal is one of the larger canals in Shaanxi Province. This canal generally has a relatively abundant water source, and in the past, water was wasted very seriously during irrigation, with water consumption exceeding the general irrigation water volume by 1 to 1.5 times. This year, the spring drought is severe, and the water volume has decreased, with each cubic meter per second of water having to bear an irrigation area of about 70,000 mu, which is 2.5 times more than in previous years. The Dali County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in response to the objectively unfavorable situation of drought and water shortage, made subjective efforts to transform it in the opposite direction, thereby promoting a major reform of the irrigation system. The County Committee formulated "Twenty Striving Goals for Changing the Face of the Luo-Hui Canal Irrigation Area," and the County Party Secretary personally led more than 100 leading cadres and technicians from various communes, management districts, and production teams in the irrigation area to systematically inspect the irrigation situation and summarize experiences twice. Afterwards, mass debates were organized among the masses in the entire irrigation area, with the production team as the unit. During the debates, everyone calculated two accounts: one was to calculate the account of saving water. The water used for one mu of land in previous years must now be used for three mu of land this year, so every effort must be made to save water, compete for every drop of water, and cherish water as much as grain. The other was to calculate the account of increasing production through rational irrigation. For example, the Yangjiazhuang Production Team of Nianqiao Commune calculated the comparative account of cotton yields using different irrigation methods in 1959. Under completely identical conditions, the yield of seed cotton per mu using small-furrow irrigation was 674 jin, while the yield per mu using flood irrigation was 621 jin, a difference of 53 jin per mu due to different irrigation methods. Through this kind of accounting comparison, everyone was educated and encouraged, and a mass movement to improve irrigation techniques was immediately launched.
    The result of the mass improvement of irrigation technology was not only saving a lot of canal water, but also pushing the entire irrigation work to a new stage. The first was to implement scientific irrigation methods, changing from flood irrigation to small-furrow irrigation. The entire irrigation area has implemented planned water use. Before each production team irrigates, irrigation technicians measure soil moisture, determine the appropriate irrigation amount according to the water demand of different crops, and irrigate in a timely and appropriate amount, which not only saves water but also benefits crop growth. The irrigation quality has been improved, and a set of irrigation canal systems and management organizations has also been established. The entire irrigation area has thoroughly renovated the canals and leveled the land. More than 9,000 large and small canals have all been straightened, weeds have been removed, and they have been filled and compacted, speeding up the flow rate, reducing seepage, and eliminating water leakage, greatly improving the utilization rate of canal water.

### 抗旱斗争促进灌溉制度大改革  洛惠渠灌溉面积翻一番

    抗旱斗争促进灌溉制度大改革
    洛惠渠灌溉面积翻一番
    本报讯　陕西省洛惠渠灌溉区依据事物在一定条件下向反面转化的辩证规律指导水利灌溉工作，在旱象持续发展、渠水减少一半的严重困难面前，改进灌溉技术，不仅节约了用水，扩大了灌溉面积，并且进一步掌握了科学用水的规律，把灌溉工作推向了一个新的阶段。今年春灌中，每秒公方水一昼夜的灌溉面积，由去年冬灌时的一千二百亩左右增加到了二千四百亩左右，并提高了灌溉质量。全灌溉区春灌总亩数比去年同期增加了一点三倍。
    洛惠渠是陕西省较大的渠道之一，这条渠道一般情况下水源比较充足，往年灌溉中水的浪费十分严重，用水量超过一般灌溉水量一倍到一倍半。今年，春旱严重水量减少，每秒公方水要负担的灌溉面积达到了七万亩左右，比往年增加了二倍半。中共大荔县委针对天旱水少这种客观上不利的一面，经过主观努力，使其向相反的方向转化，借以促进灌溉制度的大改革。县委制定了“改变洛惠渠灌溉区面貌的二十条奋斗目标”，并由县委书记亲自带领灌溉区各公社、管理区、生产队等一百多名领导干部和技术人员，先后两次到灌溉区系统的检查了灌溉情况和总结了经验。以后又在全灌溉区以生产队为单位，组织群众展开了大辩论。辩论中，大家算了两笔账：一笔是算节约用水账。往年一亩地用的水今年要用在三亩地上，因此就要千方百计节约用水，点水必争，爱水如粮。另一笔是算合理灌溉增产账。如埝桥公社杨家庄生产队算了1959年棉花不同灌溉方法的产量对比账，在其它条件完全相同的情况下，细流沟灌的亩产籽棉六百七十四斤，大水漫灌的亩产六百二十一斤，因灌溉方法不同而每亩产量就相差了五十三斤。通过这种算账对比，教育和鼓舞了大家，立即掀起了改进灌溉技术的群众运动。
    群众性的改进灌溉技术的结果，不仅节约了大量渠水，而且把整个灌溉工作，推向了一个新的阶段。首先是实行了科学的灌溉方法，改大水漫灌为小畦沟浇。全灌区都实行了计划用水。每个生产队灌溉前都由灌溉技术人员测量土壤水分，按不同作物需水量确定恰当的灌水量，适时适量灌溉，既节约了用水，又有利于作物的生长。提高了灌溉质量，同时还建立了一套灌溉渠系和管理组织。全灌溉区彻底整修了渠道和平整了土地，九千多条大小渠道全部都截弯取直、铲除杂草、填平夯实，加快了流速，减少了渗漏，杜绝了跑水，大大提高了渠水利用率。　　（薛永）
