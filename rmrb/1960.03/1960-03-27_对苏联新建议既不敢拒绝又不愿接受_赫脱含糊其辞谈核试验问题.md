Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 26th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter said yesterday, in response to questions from reporters, that he is currently unwilling to explain the characteristics of the U.S. government's attitude toward the new Soviet proposal to cease nuclear weapons testing in "any very simple terms." He said that the U.S. government is "studying the problem very seriously." He admitted that there are noteworthy "important factors" in the new Soviet proposal, but he also said that "some parts of this proposal are unacceptable."

A reporter asked the U.S. Secretary of State whether he could accept the Soviet proposal or any proposal to suspend nuclear testing without making "inspection" a prerequisite.

Herter replied that he was "unwilling to talk specifically about any specific issues." He said, "Many questions remain unresolved regarding a treaty within limits, not to mention what should be done about explosions below limits."

One reporter reminded him that the United States used the issue of supervision as a reason for not being able to conclude a nuclear test ban agreement. The reporter said that it is well-known that many representatives of the Pentagon and the Atomic Energy Commission insist that the United States should continue testing. The reporter asked Herter whether he thought that all of this cast doubt on the sincerity of the United States' official reasons. Herter refused to discuss the issue from this angle. At the same time, he reiterated that the issue of establishing so-called "adequate inspection" is the "main difference" between the United States and the Soviet Union, and said: "It is this basic principle that led to the failure of previous disarmament conferences and nuclear test conferences."

When asked whether it was possible to reach "some kind of compromise" agreement on the issue of stopping nuclear tests, Herter said, "At this stage of the game, I am unwilling to guess on what issues a compromise might be reached."

When talking about the summit conference, Herter repeated what he said two days ago in response to senators' questions in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that the summit conference would not discuss the conclusion of any treaty or agreement, and no strict agenda had been set for such negotiations.

### 对苏联新建议既不敢拒绝又不愿接受  赫脱含糊其辞谈核试验问题

    对苏联新建议既不敢拒绝又不愿接受
    赫脱含糊其辞谈核试验问题
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱昨天在回答新闻记者向他提出的问题时说，他目前不愿意以“任何很简单的字眼来说明”美国政府对苏联最近提出的停止核武器试验的新建议的特点。他说，美国政府“正在非常认真地研究这个问题”。他承认在苏联新建议中有着值得注意的“重要因素”，但是他又说，苏联“这项方案有几部分是不能接受的。”
    有记者问美国国务卿，他是否能不以“视察”为先决条件，而接受苏联的建议或任何关于暂停核试验的建议。
    赫脱回答说，他“不愿意具体谈论任何具体问题”。他说，“关于限度以内的一项条约仍然有许多问题没有解决，且不说任何有关对限度以下的爆炸应该做些什么的问题。”
    有一位记者提醒说，美国以监督问题作为不能缔结停止核试验协议的理由。这位记者说，但是大家都知道，五角大楼和原子能委员会的许多代表坚持美国要继续进行实验。记者问赫脱，他是否认为，所有这一切都使人怀疑美国官方理由的诚意。赫脱拒绝从这个角度讨论这个问题。同时，他再一次表明，建立所谓“充分视察”的问题是美国同苏联的“主要分歧”，并且说：“导致以前的裁军会议和核试验会议失败的正是这个基本原则”。
    赫脱在回答有没有可能就停止核试验问题达成“某种折衷的”协议时说，“在赌博的这个阶段，我不愿猜测就什么问题可能达成折衷。”
    赫脱在谈到最高级会议时，重复了他两天前在参议院外交委员会回答参议员问题时所说的话，即在最高级会议上不会讨论缔结某种条约或协定，也没有为这种谈判规定严格的议程。
