Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 26th: The meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee continued on the 25th under the chairmanship of the Soviet representative.

    Soviet delegation leader Zorin, speaking at the meeting, pointed out that the committee's work to date has clarified the positions of the various delegations on a number of important issues. Zorin pointed out that the Soviet delegation and other socialist countries' delegations hope to begin constructive and specific discussions on the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament. Zorin said that the Soviet delegation had made concessions to the position of Western countries on a number of issues. Zorin said that after a general exchange of views, it is now possible to begin implementing the main task of our committee – preparing an agreement on comprehensive and complete disarmament.

    Zorin went on to say that starting the preparation of a treaty also means starting concrete and serious talks on the comprehensive and complete disarmament plan from beginning to end, comparing the positions of both sides, and finding mutually acceptable solutions to the problems that arise. Zorin emphasized that agreement must be reached on the basic points of the future comprehensive and complete disarmament treaty. Agreement should be reached on the total number of measures to be implemented in the process of comprehensive and complete disarmament. Zorin recounted the measures stipulated in the Soviet Union's comprehensive and complete disarmament plan. Unfortunately, the Soviet delegation must point out that the number of measures in the disarmament plan proposed by the five Western countries cannot guarantee comprehensive and complete disarmament.

    Zorin held a press conference that afternoon to tell local and foreign journalists about the content of his speech at the committee meeting.

    The next meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will be held on the 28th.

    佐林在裁军会议上再次指出
    西方计划不能保证全面裁军
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：十国裁军委员会会议25日在苏联代表主持下继续开会。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在会上发言时指出，委员会的工作进行到现在已经澄清了各代表团在一系列重要问题上的立场。佐林指出，苏联代表团和其他社会主义国家代表团希望着手建设性地、具体地讨论全面和彻底裁军的问题。佐林说，苏联代表团在若干问题上对西方国家的立场作了迁就。佐林说，经过普遍的交换意见以后现在可以着手执行我们委员会的主要任务——筹备全面和彻底裁军的协议了。
    佐林接着说，着手筹备条约也就是意味着开始就全面和彻底裁军方案从头至尾进行具体的、认真的会谈，比较双方的立场，寻找彼此都能接受的解决出现的问题的方法，佐林强调指出，必须就未来的全面彻底裁军条约的基本点取得一致的意见。就在全面彻底裁军过程中应该实现的措施总的数量达成协议。佐林追述了苏联的全面彻底裁军方案中规定的措施。遗憾的是，苏联代表团不得不指出，西方五国提出的裁军计划中的措施数量不能保证全面和彻底裁军。
    佐林在当天下午举行了记者招待会，向当地和外国的记者们讲述了他在委员会会议上讲话的内容。
    十国裁军委员会下一次会议将在28日举行。
