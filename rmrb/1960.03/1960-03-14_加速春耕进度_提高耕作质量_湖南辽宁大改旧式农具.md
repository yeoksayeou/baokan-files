To accelerate the progress of spring plowing and improve the quality of cultivation, Hunan and Liaoning are greatly modifying old-fashioned farm tools.

(Reported by this newspaper) Hunan Province has modified 2 million pieces of old-fashioned farm tools such as plows and harrows in the spring plowing production campaign, basically meeting the needs of farmers for deep耕 tools.

The improved deep耕 plows in Hunan Province generally have the following advantages: (1) Deep plowing with light pulling force; (2) Level plowing with good soil turning; (3) Low cost and high efficiency; (4) Easy to operate, suitable for both men and women. After Shuangjiangkou Commune in Ningxiang County improved five components of the double-wheeled double-share plow, each plow only needs one ox to pull and one person to operate, and it can plow 10 to 15 mu of land per day with a depth of more than six inches, increasing the efficiency by five to six times compared to the old-fashioned plow.

The movement to improve old-fashioned farm tools in Hunan Province started in the winter of last year. According to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, integrating indigenous and foreign methods, starting from the low level to the high level, and from point to area," the Provincial Party Committee made a comprehensive plan to realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, and improvement of old-fashioned farm tools. More than 200,000 iron and wood workers were arranged throughout the province to modify and rush-produce deep耕 plows and other farm tools day and night. In order to better implement the policy of community-run industries serving agriculture, many places also adopted convenient and beneficial measures such as "setting up points in every team, having stoves in every group, assigning personnel to every household, and delivering goods to the door." Due to the above measures, the movement to improve old-fashioned farm tools in Hunan Province has had the characteristics of wide scope, great momentum, rapid progress, and remarkable results since it was launched.

Another feature of Hunan Province's improvement of old-fashioned farm tools this year is the comprehensive reform of plows, harrows, and rollers. On the basis of deep耕ing and thickening the soil layer, only by harrowing the soil finely, evenly, and thoroughly can the transplanted seedlings take root, tiller, absorb rich nutrients, accelerate their development and growth, and achieve the effect of increasing production; otherwise, the effect of deep耕ing will be diminished. Therefore, while changing old plows into deep耕 plows, all parts of Hunan Province closely focused on the improvement of harrows and rollers. In Changde Prefecture and central Hunan, which are located on the shores of Dongting Lake, the soil layer is thick and loose, and there is a lot of green manure, so the harrow teeth have been appropriately deepened, which can improve the efficiency of breaking clods and also better embed the green manure into the mud, which is convenient for accelerating its decay and fermentation. In some mountainous areas such as southern Hunan and western Hunan, where the soil structure is relatively hard, dense-toothed harrows have been promoted.

(Reported by this newspaper) A tool reform movement centered on shortening the sowing period is booming in rural Liaoning. According to incomplete statistics in early March, more than 174,000 pieces of various spring耕 sowing tools have been reformed and promoted throughout the province, and there are more than 390,000 pieces of spring耕 tools reformed last year.

Liaoning Province has a large land area and a small population. In addition, this year, the province is implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link, comprehensively leaping forward," and combining multiple planting and harvesting with high-yield and multiple harvesting. Rural labor is even more insufficient. In order not to violate the agricultural season, all localities have thoroughly implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instructions that "tool reform should be grasped early and well, so that tool reform can be ahead of the production season," and mobilized the broad masses of workers and farmers to start early. Therefore, this year's spring耕 sowing tool reform is earlier, faster, and better than in previous years. By the end of February, Panshan County had created, reformed, and imitated more than 500 sowing farm tools, most of which have been put into production. Yingkou County, which has a large area of paddy fields, has focused on rice transplanters and has imitated a large number of Jiangxi 59, Nan 105, and Hunan Li Ling models of rice transplanters. More than 70% of the county's paddy fields will basically realize rice transplanter transplanting. Xifeng County, in the spirit of using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and starting from indigenous to foreign, successfully reformed "indigenous tractors" with diesel engines. This kind of "tractor" can cultivate land, provide power for various processing machinery, and transport goods. By the end of the month, 100 units can be refitted, which is equivalent to an increase of 50 standard tractors, and 150,000 mu of land in the county has realized mechanized operations.

Another feature of this year's tool reform in Liaoning Province is: more complete sets, practical, money-saving, and high efficiency. Yongling Commune in Xinbin County created a kind of animal-powered double-ridge universal seeder, which can sow soybeans, sorghum, corn, millet, and vegetables, as well as fertilize, step on grids, and cover soil. It can sow 15 to 20 mu per day, increasing efficiency by more than three times compared to using old plows. The double-row corn planter produced by Pianling Commune in Xiuyan County can complete four processes at one time, including ditching, sowing, soil covering, and suppression. One person and one animal can sow 24 mu of land a day, increasing work efficiency by seven times.

### 加速春耕进度　提高耕作质量  湖南辽宁大改旧式农具

    加速春耕进度　提高耕作质量
    湖南辽宁大改旧式农具
    本报讯　湖南省各地在春耕生产运动中，共改良旧式犁耙等农具二百万件，基本满足了农民对深耕工具的需要。
    湖南省经过改良的深耕犁，一般具有以下几个优点：（一）犁得深、拉力轻；（二）犁得平、翻土好；（三）成本低、工效高；
  （四）操作方便，男女都可使用。宁乡县双江口公社对双轮双铧犁改进五个部件以后，每部犁只需要一头牛拉，一个人掌握，一天就可以犁田十至十五亩，深度可保证在六寸以上，比旧式犁提高工效五至六倍。
    湖南省改良旧式农具的运动是从去年冬季开始的。省委根据“土洋并举，土洋结合、由低到高、由点到面”的方针，作出了实现机械化、半机械化和改良旧式农具的全面规划。全省共安排了二十多万铁木工人，夜以继日地改良赶制深耕犁等农具。为了更好地贯彻社办工业为农业服务，许多地方还采取了“队队设点，火炉到组，人员到户，送货上门”等便民、利民的方法。由于采取了上述措施，湖南省改良旧式农具的运动刚一展开，就具有范围广、声势大、进展快、成效显著的特色。
    湖南省今年改良提高旧式农具的另一特点是：犁、耙、滚成套改革。在田土深耕、土层加厚的基础上，只有将泥土耙得细、耙得平、滚得烂，插下的秧苗才能更好地生根分蘖，吸取丰富养分，加速其发育成长，收到增产的效果；否则，深耕的效果就会减色。因此，湖南省各地在改旧犁为深耕犁的同时，就十分密切地抓紧了耙和滚的改良。地处洞庭湖滨的常德专区和湘中等地区，田土土层厚而疏松，加之绿肥多，就适当加深了耙齿，这样就可提高破坯效能，同时也能更好地将绿肥扎入泥中，便于加速其腐烂发酵，湘南、湘西等部分山区土层结构较为坚硬，就推广了密齿耙。
    本报讯　辽宁农村一个以缩短播种期为中心的工具改革运动正在蓬勃发展。据3月初不完全统计，全省已改革推广了各种春耕播种工具达十七万四千多件，连同去年改良的春耕工具共有三十九万多件。
    辽宁省地多人少，加上今年贯彻“以粮为纲，全面跃进”和多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针，农村劳动力更感不足，为了不违农时，各地深入贯彻了省委“工具改革要抓早抓好，让工具改革走在生产季节前面”的指示精神，发动广大职工和农民群众提早动手。因此今年的春耕播种工具改革比历年进行得又早又快又好。盘山县到2月末，已创造改制和仿制成功的播种农具有五百多件，已大部投入了生产。水田面积较多的营口县，重点抓住了水稻插秧机，已仿制出大批的江西五九、南一零五和湖南醴零等型插秧机，全县有70％以上水田将基本实现插秧机插秧。西丰县本着土法上马，土洋结合，由土到洋的精神，用柴油机改制“土拖拉机”成功，这种“拖拉机”能耕地，能做各种加工机械的动力，又能运输，到月末可改装一百台，等于增加了五十个标准台拖拉机，全县有十五万亩土地实现了机械作业。
    辽宁省今年工具改革的另一个特点是：配套多、能实用、省钱、工效高。新宾县永陵公社创制一种畜力双垅万能播种机，既能播种大豆、高粱、玉米、谷子和蔬菜，又能施肥、踩格子和复土，一天播十五到二十亩，比用旧犁提高功效三倍以上。岫岩县偏岭公社制出的玉米双行点播机，一次就能完成开沟、播种、复土和镇压等四道工序，一人一畜一天可播二十四亩地，提高工作效率七倍。
