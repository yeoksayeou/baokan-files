Think about Future Architecture
Lu Ming

Architecture, like a bird, relies on its two wings—building materials and construction technology—which are constantly growing fuller with feathers, to fly higher and higher. In the years to come, to what heights will it fly?

Thousands of years ago, people could only use what nature provided: clay, reeds, vines, bamboo, wood, natural stone, and natural paints to decorate the face of buildings.

In the seventh to sixth centuries BC, people invented bricks by baking clay, and thus began the first new milestone in the history of architecture. In the nineteenth century, concrete was invented, and later reinforced concrete, and thus architecture entered the stage of modern architecture.

Whether it is brick or concrete, although they are relatively strong, they are bulky and do not provide good thermal insulation.

Is it possible to produce bricks that are light, load-bearing, and insulating for walls?

A new era of "foam architecture" has begun in the history of architecture.

"Foam architecture" is built with foam materials. Foam material is a solidified foam. By adding a "foaming agent" to cement, a large number of air bubbles are continuously generated during the mixing and solidification of the cement. At this time, the volume of the cement slurry in the mold continuously expands. When it expands to the required level and solidifies, the bubbles inside can no longer escape, and it becomes foamed cement.

Building houses with foam materials saves a lot of raw materials and reduces the weight of the house. The countless air bubbles in the foam do not conduct heat, which can make the house "warm in winter and cool in summer."

Foam materials are responsible for insulation and soundproofing, while other materials are responsible for load-bearing. For example, for load-bearing, a 24-centimeter-thick brick wall is enough, but in Northeast China, a 37-centimeter-thick brick wall is necessary for insulation. In the future, we only need to place the foam material between two very thin concrete pressed boards to satisfy both insulation and load-bearing requirements.

However, people are not satisfied with "foam materials." People also imagine whether it is possible to use artificial synthesis to create glass that is as hard as steel and steel that is as transparent as glass.

At this time, chemical knowledge will come out to help people, helping people rearrange the basic components of matter—atoms and molecules—so that they can be recombined and reconnected, and thus architecture will enter the era of "plastic architecture."

Plastic is a synthetic material. It is very light but can withstand great tensile and compressive forces, is not afraid of acid and alkali corrosion, is not afraid of temperature changes, is non-conductive and non-heat-conducting, and has very stable characteristics. It can be transparent or have various bright colors.

Building houses with foamed plastic (polystyrene) is even better than foamed cement products. Walls made of plastic only need to be one or two centimeters thick and are absolutely warm; made into floors, even if you jump on them, there won't be much noise.

Plastic can glue objects like glue and can be welded arbitrarily like steel, so "plastic architecture" will be "seamless."

Transparent plastic allows sunlight to enter freely, and the entire building will be as exquisite and translucent as a "crystal palace."

In the future, building a house will be as quick and easy as a child stacking blocks. An entire wall, the floor of a room, a layer of stairs... all of this is first processed according to the design drawings in the "house prefabricated factory" and then hoisted on site.

Please don't worry, this industrialized construction of prefabricated houses will never be "stereotyped" or "lack of beauty." On the contrary, it requires architects to exert their greatest imagination and artistic genius to combine the most diverse and beautiful architectural forms and building complexes with the fewest components.

In future buildings, automatic air conditioning equipment will ensure that the air is constantly fresh. Small semiconductor heating and cooling devices are embedded in the walls. When the button is pressed to pass the current in the positive direction, it heats up, and when the current passes in the opposite direction, it absorbs heat, making the room "spring-like all year round."

The small luminescent semiconductor embedded in the ceiling absorbs solar radiation energy during the day, and at night it converts the absorbed energy into light. After adjustment, this light can last for more than ten hours. So even though the sun has set, the room is bright all night long.

In agricultural production, plastics also have a wide range of uses. This is a greenhouse model, its raw material is not glass but plastic.

    想一想未来的建筑
    路明
    建筑，就像一只鸟，依靠它那不断丰满着羽毛的两个翅膀——建筑材料和施工技术，越飞越高。在未来的年代里，它将要飞到什么样的高程？
    几千年以前，人们只能拿着自然所赐予的一切：粘土、芦苇、藤、竹、木材、天然石料和天然油漆，来打扮建筑的容颜。
    在公元前七到六世纪的时候，人们把粘土坯经过焙烧，而发明了砖，于是在建筑的发展史上，开始了第一个新的里程。到了十九世纪，发明了混凝土，后来又发明了钢筋混凝土，于是建筑就进入了现代建筑的阶段。
    砖也好，混凝土也好，它们虽然比较坚固，却很笨重，也不能很好地隔热保温。
    能不能生产又轻巧、又能承重又能保温的砖来作墙呢？
    建筑的历史上开始了一个“泡沫建筑”的新时代。
   “泡沫建筑”是用泡沫材料盖起来的。泡沫材料就是一块凝固了的泡沫。在水泥里加入“泡沫剂”，在水泥的搅拌、凝固过程中泡沫剂不断产生大量气泡，这时，模子里的水泥浆体积不断膨胀，当膨胀到需要的程度而凝固以后，里面的泡沫就再也出不去了，这就变成泡沫水泥。
    用泡沫材料盖房子，节省了大量的原料，减轻了房屋的重量。泡沫里的无数空气泡，是不传热的，它能使房屋“冬暖夏凉”。
    泡沫材料专管保温隔音，而由别的材料担负承重的任务。例如，为了承重，二十四厘米厚砖墙就够了，但在我国东北，为了保温，就非要三十七厘米厚砖墙才行。将来，我们只要把泡沫材料放在两层很薄的混凝压榨板中间，保温承重就同时得到了满足。
    但是，人们并不满足“泡沫材料”，人们又设想能不能用人工合成的方法制造出钢一样坚硬的玻璃，玻璃一样透明的钢。
    这时，化学知识将出来帮助人们，帮助人们重新排列了物质的基本组成——原子和分子，使它们重新组合，重新连结，于是建筑就将跨入“塑料建筑”的时代。
    塑料，是一种人工合成的材料。它非常轻，但却能承受很大力量的拉、压，不怕酸碱的侵蚀，不怕温度的变化，不导电不传热，性格非常稳定。它可以是透明的，也可以有各种鲜艳的颜色。
    拿泡沫塑料（聚苯乙烯）盖房子，比泡沫水泥制品还要优越。塑料做成的墙壁只要一两厘米厚，绝对保暖；做成地板，即使在上面蹦跳，也不会有多大的声音。
    塑料可以像胶水一样来胶合物件，又可以像钢一样任意焊接，所以“塑料建筑”将是“天衣无缝”。
    透明的塑料允许日光任意进入，整个一幢这样的建筑，将像“水晶宫”似的玲珑剔透。
    将来盖起一幢房子就像小孩堆积木似的快和容易。整个一面墙，一间房子的楼板，一层层的楼梯……所有这一切，都是先在“房屋预制工厂”按设计图纸加工出来，然后在现场吊装。
    请不必担心，这种工业化施工的预制的房屋，绝不会“千篇一律”“没有美感”，相反，它正需要建筑师们发挥最大的想像力和艺术天才，用最少的构件，去结合千变万化的漂亮的建筑形体和建筑群。
    在未来的建筑里，自动的空气调节设备，保证了空气常新。小巧的半导体的取暖降温装置，被镶嵌在墙壁里，当按通电钮，使电流正方向通过它时，它就发热，而当电流反方向通过它时，它就吸热，使室内“四季如春”。
    嵌在天花板上的不大的磷光半导体，白天吸收了太阳的辐射能，夜晚它就把吸收的能量变成光亮，经过调节，这种光亮能持续十几个小时。所以尽管太阳已经落山了，室内却是通夜放光明。

    在农业生产上，塑料也有广泛的用途。这是一个暖房模型，它的原料不是玻璃而是塑料。
