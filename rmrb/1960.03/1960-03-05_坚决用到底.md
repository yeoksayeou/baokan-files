    Resolutely Use It to the End
    Rice transplanter, oh rice transplanter,
    I didn't believe in you in the past;
    Today I see you can transplant rice seedlings,
    We will resolutely use you to the end.
      —Guizhou Folk Song

    坚决用到底
    插秧机来插秧机，
    往日听了不信你；
    今日看你能插秧，
    我们坚决用到底。
      ——贵州民歌
