Waterwheel Ballad
    Down the ridge, spinning wheels stand row on row,
    Spinning silver yarn with creaks and groans,
    Silver yarn flutters, scattering all over the slopes,
    Weaving a picture welcoming spring.

    It's not spinning wheels spinning silver yarn,
    But drought-resistant waterwheels built along the river;
    Silver water rushes through the air,
    Ten thousand acres of rice paddies sprout green shoots.

    水车谣岭下纺车一架架，咿咿呀呀纺银纱，银纱飘飘满坡窜，织成一幅迎春画。不是纺车纺银纱，河边搭满抗旱车；银水哗哗半空走，万顷秧田冒绿芽。
