    Ensure Sufficient and High-Quality Green Manure Seeds
    Jiangxi Establishes Extensive Seed Farms to Prepare for Expanded Green Manure Planting Next Year
    (Our Dispatch) Jiangxi Province is proactively tackling the green manure seed preservation work this year, strengthening the management of green manure seed fields, and ensuring more and better seeds for expanding green manure planting next year.
    Jiangxi Province plans to expand the green manure sowing area to 25 million mu next year, based on this year's 20 million mu, to achieve basic green manuring of farmland for spring-sown crops. At the same time, it is also preparing to transfer a large number of green manure seeds to support other provinces and regions. To accomplish this task, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership over green manure seed preservation work since February. Currently, the province has established a total of 2.5 million mu of green manure seed fields. People's communes in more than 30 major green manure producing counties in Jiangxi Province, such as Leping and Yongxiu, which have been designated as seed propagation bases, will propagate 2.2 million jin of seeds for the state in addition to ensuring the needs of local green manure development. Recently, the agricultural and commercial departments of Jiangxi Province have allocated 2 million yuan in seed pre-purchase deposits to the communes propagating seeds, and subsidized 8.5 million jin of chemical fertilizers for seed fields.
    In recent years, Jiangxi Province has had relatively sufficient green manure seed preservation, enabling continuous expansion of green manure planting area. This is mainly due to the firm implementation of the seed work policy of "self-selection, self-propagation, self-preservation, and self-use, supplemented by necessary adjustments." Various communes have universally established "seed fields," gradually achieving seed self-sufficiency and surplus in every commune. At the same time, the province has also focused on selecting more than 30 counties (or farms) with large green manure planting areas, high yields, and abundant seed preservation to establish seed propagation bases. According to this year's plan for developing green manure seeds throughout the province, the selected seeds can not only be allocated to areas within the province that lack seeds, but will also support Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shanghai and other provinces (regions) and cities according to cooperative plans.

### 把绿肥种子留足留好  江西大量建立种子田为明年扩种绿肥作好准备

    把绿肥种子留足留好
    江西大量建立种子田为明年扩种绿肥作好准备
    本报讯　江西省提早抓今年绿肥留种工作，加强留种绿肥田的管理，保证明年扩种绿肥有更多更好的种籽。
    江西省明年计划绿肥播种面积将在今年二千万亩的基础上扩大到二千五百万亩，实现春播作物农田基本绿肥化；同时还准备调出大批绿肥种子，支援其他省、区。要完成这个任务，就必须在今年春季把绿肥种籽留足留好。为此，中共江西省委和各级党委从2月份以来，就层层加强了对绿肥留种工作的领导。现在全省共建立绿肥留种田二百五十万亩。被江西省划定种子繁殖基地的乐平、永修等三十多个绿肥主要产区县的人民公社，留种面积除保证本地发展绿肥的需要以外，还将代国家繁殖二百二十万斤种籽。最近江西省农业和商业部门已经拨给繁殖种籽的公社二百万元种子预购定金，并补助留种田化学肥料八百五十万斤。
    江西省几年来绿肥留种比较充足，能够不断扩大绿肥种植面积，主要是坚决贯彻执行了“自选、自繁、自留、自用，辅之以必要调剂”的种籽工作方针，各个公社普遍建立“留种田”，逐步做到社社种子自给和有余。同时全省又有重点地选择绿肥种植面积大、产量高、留种多的三十多个县（或农场），建立了种子繁殖基地。根据今年全省发展绿肥种子的计划，所留选的种子，不但可以调剂给省内缺种地区，同时还将按协作计划支援广东、福建、山东、广西、云南、上海等省（区）市。　（江西省农业厅）
