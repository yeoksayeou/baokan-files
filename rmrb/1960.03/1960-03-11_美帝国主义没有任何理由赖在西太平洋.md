U.S. imperialism has no reason to stay in the Western Pacific
Xiao Guang

    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons recently delivered a series of speeches, blatantly clamoring that the United States must seize the Western Pacific region and "cannot shirk its responsibility." In order to justify the United States' actions of persisting in aggression and expansion and antagonizing the people of the Far East, Parsons nonsensically claimed that the reason why the U.S. aggressive forces must remain in the Western Pacific is entirely to prevent China from "threatening" the national independence of Far Eastern countries. The origin of this so-called "threat" lies in the fact that China has become a powerful force, while the "free countries" around China are weak. Therefore, the United States' "primary task is to help these countries survive" in order to maintain the "balance of power" in the Far East; therefore, it is necessary for the United States to "maintain bases and naval forces in this region" in order to "quickly use our forces to deal with various situations"; therefore, the United States must strengthen military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan, the Syngman Rhee Group in South Korea, and the Ngo Dinh Diem Group in South Vietnam, and regard them as "indispensable forces in the U.S. forward defense strategy."
    What a ridiculous argument! The strength of New China has actually become a reason for the United States to invade China and the Far East. However, all lies cannot withstand verification. As soon as history or reality is mentioned, they cannot help but reveal their true colors. If, as Parsons said, U.S. imperialism's occupation of the Western Pacific, launching aggression, and creating tension are merely to prevent China's "threat," then how should the U.S. imperialism's rampage in the Pacific Asia, and the many acts of aggression and expansion it carried out, before the founding of New China be explained? Everyone knows that the United States occupied the Philippines and many strategic islands in the Pacific as early as sixty years ago; and as early as the end of World War II, it controlled Japan and South Korea, and tried to control China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, and India. Is all this due to the "strength of Communist China"?
    Who is threatening the national independence of the Far Eastern countries? Who is threatening peace and security in Asia? Opening a map makes it clear that today, in this vast area from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam to Thailand and Pakistan, U.S. military bases are scattered everywhere. Japan alone has more than 800 U.S. military facilities of different natures; and Okinawa, the "hub base" linking Japan and Taiwan, has eight missile bases on an area of less than 1,200 square kilometers. South Korea is regarded by the U.S. Pentagon as the most important army and air force base, and is stationed with the U.S. Eighth Army and a large number of air force units equipped with atomic rocket weapons. The United States has established nearly 50 airports and naval bases in Taiwan; and a vast network of air force and naval bases has been established on the islands of the Philippines. According to the Geneva Accords, South Vietnam, which is not allowed to provide military bases to any foreign country, has become a U.S. base of aggression. Some of its air force bases have been expanded into heavy jet aircraft bases capable of carrying nuclear weapons; and the naval bases in Saigon and Da Nang are also being rebuilt. The United States has built more than 20 military bases in Thailand; and more than 40 bases in Pakistan. The United States has also established air and naval bases and naval strongholds on many islands in the Pacific. The islands with the largest bases include Guam, Hawaii, Saipan, Midway, Wake, Johnston, Caroline, Marshall, Ogasawara, Samoa, and Fiji. All these aggressive bases and military facilities were established under the guise of "promoting security" and "common defense," and Parsons specifically called them "defensive shields." But U.S. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in the Pacific Area, Felt, openly admitted that this is "a chain for the United States to deal with China in the Pacific area." Haven't the recent developments in the Far East fully proved its aggressiveness? It was precisely by using these bases that the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea; and carried out military provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait.
    Let's take a look at the deployment of troops. It is a well-known fact that the U.S. troop deployment in the Pacific region is far larger than it was during World War II against Japan. According to the Soviet "Naval News," the United States maintains approximately 500,000 troops, 7,000 aircraft, and hundreds of ships in the Pacific. The total number of U.S. troops stationed in the Far East is more than 200,000. The "New York Times" does not deny that "considering the power of nuclear weapons, the United States has concentrated an unprecedentedly large and powerful air and naval strike force in the Western Pacific." The United States, which is located in the Eastern Pacific, has gone to the Western Pacific from thousands of miles away to build a large-scale military encirclement and deploy such a huge atomic force. Who can believe that this is a "defensive" action? Is there any country in the world, other than an aggressive imperialist, that would build its line of defense on the territory of another country? The U.S. Seventh Fleet, with 125 ships and 600 new aircraft, patrols back and forth in front of the gates of Far Eastern countries, conducting provocative military exercises. The United States not only continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, but has never stopped its military provocations against China. As of March 6, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged ninety serious warnings regarding the military provocations of U.S. naval vessels and air force aircraft invading China's territorial waters and airspace. If all this can be called "preventing threats," then shouldn't the word "aggression" simply be abolished?
    It should be known that the aggressive military alliances and military blocs that the United States has pieced together in the Far East are all under the banner of "promoting security" and "common defense." Take the recently concluded Japan-U.S. military alliance as an example. Under the name of "common security," the United States has firmly tied Japan to its war chariot. The U.S.-Japan reactionaries are not only accelerating Japan's nuclear armament, but also openly declaring that their scope of aggression includes "the area north of the Philippines, Japan and its surrounding areas, including Korea, China's Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu, and the Soviet Union's Kuril Islands." As for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which aims to antagonize China, control independent countries in Southeast Asia, and maintain and create tension in Asia, it has left a series of shameful records since its establishment in September 1954. In addition to holding a series of military exercises every year to carry out war provocations and military intimidation, openly taking China as a "hypothetical enemy," it also actively interferes in the internal affairs of Asian countries and suppresses Asian national independence movements through subversive activities, military coups, political division, and instigation and slander. Everyone remembers how the United States and its vassal states formulated a "blueprint" at the Wellington Conference to provoke civil war in Laos, subvert the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and implement its plan to occupy the entire Indochina; and the situations in Indonesia and Burma, as well as the so-called Taiwan issue and Tibet issue, were actually included in the agenda of this aggressive group.
    In recent times, although the United States has begun to play the "peace strategy," it has intensified its arms expansion, war preparations, and provocative activities in various parts of the Far East. The United States not only still occupies South Korea, continues to station troops in Japan, occupies our territory of Taiwan and Japan's Okinawa, but also expands missile bases in these places, strengthens military blocs, conducts various provocative military exercises, and prepares for new wars of aggression. In Japan, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are actively strengthening their military forces, accelerating nuclear armament, and test-producing missiles after forming an aggressive military alliance. In South Korea, the U.S. side openly abandoned the provisions of the armistice agreement prohibiting the import of reinforcing weapons, illegally importing large quantities of missiles and rocket weapons, and reorganizing the South Korean army into five atomic divisions. In Indochina, the United States continues to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos and expand the civil war in Laos; the United States not only rejected the resolution of the Vietnam International Committee to withdraw the "U.S. Temporary Equipment Renewal Group" from South Vietnam, but also stepped up the armament of South Vietnam and plotted a large-scale suppression of former anti-Japanese personnel. Senior U.S. military commanders in the Far East continue to issue war cries. U.S. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in the Pacific Area, Felt, said that small-scale wars could break out in Asia at any time. The spokesperson of the U.S. Eighth Army in South Korea even bluntly said that the atomic weapons in South Korea "are fully ready and can launch a fierce attack on selected targets in North Korea within 30 minutes as soon as the White House orders." U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Hopwood, U.S. Commander of the Forces in South Korea Decker, and others also spread warmongering remarks. According to Western news agencies, U.S. Secretary of the Army Bruck revealed that the United States has drawn up detailed plans for waging war in Southeast Asia.
    The facts are very clear: it is not others who are threatening the national independence of the Far Eastern countries, but the United States itself; it is not others who are threatening peace and security in Asia, but the United States itself. All threats come from U.S. imperialism, and the root of all threats to peace and tranquility in Asia comes from the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialists. All U.S. imperialists, including Parsons, can arbitrarily release the smoke screen of "communist threat," and can fantasize about inventing the "promote security" theory, the "establish balance of power" theory, this theory or that theory; but they can in no way conceal the essence of the U.S. aggressive policy. The crimes of the U.S. aggressors are objectively existing, and unless it rolls back to the other side of the Pacific one day, no amount of sophistry will help.
    The last excuse Parsons made for the U.S. aggressive forces staying in the Western Pacific is that some "countries" have been able to survive under the protection of the United States. This is not entirely false. The reactionary puppet regimes that the United States has propped up with bayonets and dollars in South Korea, South Vietnam, and other places, such as the Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem groups, cannot survive a day without the United States. The United States has indeed given a lot of "help" to these most corrupt, most reactionary, and darkest forces in Asia, but have they become "stronger" as a result? Let's take a look at South Korea, which the United States has praised as a "'free world' showcase." In the past ten years, the United States has given the Syngman Rhee group US$2.68 billion in economic "aid" and US$1.5 billion in military "aid." But South Korea has only ended up with economic bankruptcy and a lack of livelihood. At present, South Korea's national industry is dying, and the total industrial output value has fallen to half of what it was at the end of Japanese rule; South Korea's rural areas have changed from the "granary" of the past to the "land of hunger." Inflation is serious and the cost of living is high. According to United Nations statistics, South Korea's national income ranks at the bottom of the world. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people accounts for more than half of the population with labor capacity. The people of South Korea describe their lives as "the deepest suffering of the people's livelihood in forty years"; "the highest prices in six hundred years"; "finding a job is harder than picking stars in the sky." The Syngman Rhee group, which is extremely corrupt, rotten, reactionary, and autocratic, implements the most barbaric rule over the people with more than 80,000 policemen and secret agents. In 1958 alone, it arrested and imprisoned more than 240,000 people, with an average of one in every hundred people being victimized. Even Western journalists cannot deny that South Korea under the rule of the Syngman Rhee group is "a place of death and dying," "a terrible hell," and "an outright police state"; believing that "the United States' support for such a shameful autocratic system as Syngman Rhee is a bad and human dignity." As for the situation of the Ngo Dinh Diem group, it is by no means better than that of Syngman Rhee. In 1958, a research report by Harvard University Professor Ford wrote: Although the United States has provided 1 billion U.S. dollars in "aid" to such a small "country" as South Vietnam in the past four years, South Vietnam has experienced a "very serious and insurmountable economic recession." U.S. Democratic Senator Gore admitted that the United States supports "a basically totalitarian government in South Vietnam, and this government is working under very difficult circumstances." Ngo Dinh Diem's own "National Revolution" newspaper also did not shy away from the fact that it "cannot really control many villages" and "must try to win the influence of many places." It is no wonder that Ngo Dinh Diem had to build a helicopter airport in his "Presidential Palace" to prevent emergencies.
    Despite these many situations, in the eyes of U.S. imperialism, the likes of Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem are the most loyal and capable servants. Please see, from implementing Eisenhower's proposition of "Asians fighting Asians" to obstructing the peaceful reunification of the North and South (Korea, Vietnam), is there anyone more determined and thorough than them? The South Korean and South Vietnamese troops, which were equipped and trained by the United States, are ready to "advance north" at any time. The United States boasts that South Korea is "the best springboard for attacking mainland China"; Syngman Rhee immediately wrote "Today the 38th parallel, tomorrow Changbai Mountain" on all the large stones on the 38th parallel. The United States said that South Vietnam should become an anti-communist outpost of the "free world"; Ngo Dinh Diem immediately announced that "the border of the United States has been extended to the 17th parallel in Vietnam." The United States threatened the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, with stopping "aid," and the troops of the Ngo Dinh Diem group suddenly appeared in Cambodia. Isn't the reason why the United States is doing its utmost to support the dregs of humanity like Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem precisely to make them its tools of aggression? Now, even the U.S. congressmen have admitted that in the minds of the masses in various parts of the Far East, there is an equal sign between the United States and "militarism and corruption." Can anyone still be expected to believe his ghost words such as "helping to survive"?
    U.S. imperialism's rampage in the Western Pacific, carrying out aggression and expansion activities, has harmed the interests of the Asian people and threatened peace and tranquility in Asia, and cannot but arouse strong opposition from the people of various countries. Today, from China and Japan to every corner of the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaya, the cry of "U.S. imperialism get out of the Western Pacific" has been heard. The broad masses of the Japanese people are resolutely carrying out the struggle to prevent the ratification and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty" with unprecedented momentum. The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people, and it is necessary to force the United States to withdraw its troops and abolish its military bases. Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejirō Asanuma stated that the basic issue of maintaining peace in the Far East is first of all that the United States withdraws its troops from its bases in Okinawa and other parts of Japan, China's Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines. The "Manila Chronicle" once called on the Filipino people to "do their best to expose the hypocrisy of the U.S. policy towards the Philippines and tell the world that the purpose of the United States here... is to use its bases to maintain its suzerainty over our country forever." "As long as the United States enjoys extraterritorial rights on any inch of land in the Philippines, they will prevent the Philippines from exercising its sovereignty as an independent country." Even in South Korea, which is under the strict control of the U.S. military, leaflets of "Yankee go home" have appeared; and in South Vietnam, where the United States is in the position of "Taishang Huang," incidents of throwing bombs at U.S. "advisors" have occurred. The angry mood of the broad masses of the Asian people towards the U.S. aggressors can be imagined. A British journalist described these as "red lights" that Americans should pay attention to. That's right, that's exactly the case. We have repeatedly warned the U.S. aggressors that the Western Pacific is the Western Pacific of the Western Pacific people; the affairs of the Western Pacific should be managed by the Western Pacific people themselves, and there is no need for U.S. imperialism to interfere. Sooner or later, U.S. imperialism will be driven back to its old home in the Eastern Pacific by the Asian people.

    美帝国主义没有任何理由赖在西太平洋
    萧光
    美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯最近接连发表演说，公然叫嚷美国必须抓住西太平洋地区，“不能推卸责任”。为了替美国这种坚持侵略扩张、与远东人民为敌的行径狡辩，帕森斯胡说什么美国侵略势力之所以必须留在西太平洋，完全是为了防止中国对远东国家民族独立的“威胁”。而这种所谓“威胁”的由来，就在于中国已经变成强大的力量，中国周围的“自由国家”却是虚弱的。因此美国的“首要任务是要帮助这些国家生存下去”，以维持远东地区的“均势”；因此美国有必要“在这个地区保持基地和海军力量”，以便“迅速利用我们的力量以应付各种局势”；因此美国要加强对台湾蒋介石集团、南朝鲜李承晚集团和南越吴庭艳集团的军事援助，把它们作为“美国前沿防御战略不可少的部队”。
    这是多么荒唐的论调！新中国的强大居然也变成美国侵略中国和远东的理由了。然而，一切谎言都经不起对证，稍一提到历史或现实，它就不能不原形毕露了。如果按照帕森斯所说，美帝国主义盘踞西太平洋，发动侵略和制造紧张，仅仅是为了防止中国的“威胁”；那么，新中国成立以前，美帝国主义在太平洋亚洲的横行霸道、进行的那许多侵略和扩张活动，又该作何解释？谁都知道，美国早在六十多年前就霸占了菲律宾和太平洋上的许多战略岛屿；早当第二次世界大战结束之初，就控制了日本和南朝鲜，而且力图控制中国、印度尼西亚、越南、泰国、缅甸和印度。难道这一切都是由于“共产党中国的强大”吗？
    究竟是谁威胁着远东国家的民族独立？是谁威胁亚洲的和平与安全？一打开地图就可以清楚，今天，在从南朝鲜、日本、台湾、菲律宾、南越到泰国、巴基斯坦的这一广大地区内，美国的军事基地星罗棋布。光是日本就有八百多个性质不同的美军设施；而作为联结日本和台湾的“枢纽基地”的冲绳岛，在面积不到一千二百平方公里的土地上，却有八处导弹基地。南朝鲜被美国五角大楼视为最重要的陆军基地和空军基地，驻扎着美国第八军和配备着原子火箭武器的大量空军部队。美国在台湾建立了将近五十个飞机场和海军据点；在菲律宾的岛屿上建立了广阔的空军基地和海军基地网。按照日内瓦协议的规定，不准向任何外国提供军事基地的南越全境已变成美国的侵略基地。它的部分空军基地已扩建为能够携带核武器的重型喷气飞机基地；西贡和岘港的海军基地也正在改建。美国在泰国建有二十几个军事基地；巴基斯坦境内的基地在四十个以上。美国还在太平洋的许多岛屿上建立了空、海军基地和舰艇据点。设有最大基地的岛屿有关岛、夏威夷岛、塞班岛、中途岛、威克岛、约翰斯顿岛、加罗林岛、马绍尔群岛、小笠原群岛、萨摩阿群岛、菲吉群岛等。所有这些侵略性的基地和军事设施都是在“促进安全”、“共同防御”的幌子下建立的，帕森斯还特别把它们叫做“防御盾牌”。但美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特却公开承认这是“美国在太平洋一带对付中国的锁链”。近年来远东的事态不也充分证明了它的侵略性吗？美国正是利用这些基地发动了侵略朝鲜的战争；在台湾海峡对中国进行军事挑衅。
    让我们再看看兵力部署。人所共知的事实是，美国在太平洋区域的兵力部署比第二次世界大战中对付日本时还庞大得多。据苏联“海军报”报道，美国在太平洋保持了大约五十万兵力、七千架飞机，数百艘舰艇。驻在远东的美军总数在二十万以上。“纽约时报”并不否认“考虑到核子武器的威力，美国在太平洋西部集中了空前众多的威力强大的空海军突击力量。”居于东太平洋的美国偏偏不远万里而跑到西太平洋来大事建筑军事包围圈、作出如此庞大的原子兵力部署，有谁能相信这是“防御性”的行动呢？世界上除了侵略成性的帝国主义，难道还有任何国家竟把自己的国防线建立在旁的国家领土上的吗？拥有一百二十五艘舰艇、六百架新式飞机的美国第七舰队，来往巡逻于远东各国的大门前，进行挑衅性的军事演习。美国不但继续霸占中国的领土台湾，并且从未停止对中国的军事挑衅。截至3月6日为止，中国外交部发言人已就美国海军舰只和空军飞机侵入中国领海、领空的军事挑衅事件提出了九十次严重警告。如果这一切都可以叫做“防止威胁”的话，侵略这个字眼不是干脆可以取消了吗？
    要知道，美国在远东拼凑的那些侵略性军事同盟、军事集团，也统统打着“促进安全”、“共同防御”的招牌。就以最近缔结的日美军事同盟而言，美国在“共同安全”的名义下，把日本牢牢地绑到自己的战车上。美日反动派不仅加速日本的核武装，并公然宣称它们的侵略范围包括“菲律宾以北、日本及其周围地区，包括朝鲜、中国的台湾、金门、马祖和苏联的千岛群岛。”至于以敌视中国、控制东南亚独立国家、保持和制造亚洲紧张局势为目的的东南亚条约集团，自从1954年9月成立以来，已留下一连串可耻的记录。它除了每年举行一系列的军事演习，进行战争挑衅和武力恫吓，公然以中国为“假想敌人”；还通过颠复活动、军事政变、政治分化、煽动诬蔑等手段，积极干涉亚洲国家内政、镇压亚洲的民族独立运动。大家还记得，美国同它的仆从国家曾怎样在惠灵顿会议上拟制挑起老挝内战、颠复柬埔寨王国政府、推行它霸占整个印度支那计划的“蓝图”；而印度尼西亚和缅甸等国的局势以及所谓的台湾问题和西藏问题，居然也被列入这个侵略集团的会议议程。
    近一个时期以来，美国虽然开始玩弄“和平战略”，却更加紧进行在远东各地的扩军备战和挑衅活动。美国不仅仍然占领着南朝鲜，继续在日本驻扎军队，霸占着我国的领土台湾和日本的冲绳岛，并且在这些地方扩大导弹基地、加强军事集团、进行名目繁多的挑衅性的军事演习，准备新的侵略战争。在日本，美日反动派在结成侵略性的军事同盟后，正积极加强军事力量、加紧核武装并试制导弹。在南朝鲜，美国方面公然毁弃停战协定关于禁止输入增援武器的条款，非法运入大批导弹和火箭武器，把南朝鲜军队改编为五单位原子师。在印度支那，美国继续干涉老挝内政、扩大老挝内战；美国非但拒绝越南国际委员会要“美国临时装备更新团”撤出南越的决议，而且加紧武装南越、策划大规模镇压前抗战人员的阴谋。美国远东高级军事将领不断发出战争叫嚣。美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特说，在亚洲，任何时候都可能发生小规模战争。美国在南朝鲜的第八军发言人甚至赤裸裸地说，在南朝鲜的原子武器“已经完全准备好，只要白宫命令一下，就可以在三十分钟以内猛烈打击北朝鲜方面被选定的目标。”美国太平洋舰队总司令霍普伍德、美国驻南朝鲜部队总司令德克尔等也大肆散布好战言论。据西方通讯社报道，美国陆军部长布鲁克透露美国已经详细拟订了在东南亚进行战争的计划。
    事实很清楚，威胁远东国家民族独立的不是别人，恰恰是美国自己；威胁亚洲和平和安全的不是别人，也正是美国自己。一切威胁都来自美帝国主义，一切威胁亚洲和平与安宁的根源都来自美帝国主义者的侵略野心。所有的美帝国主义者，包括帕森斯在内，可以任意施放“共产主义威胁”的烟幕，可以异想天开地发明“促进安全”论、“建立均势”论、这个论或那个论；但他们无论如何也掩盖不了美国侵略政策的实质。美国侵略者的罪行是客观存在着的，除非它哪一天滚回太平洋彼岸，否则任何狡辩抵赖也无济于事。
    帕森斯为美国侵略势力赖在西太平洋不走制造的最后一个借口是，有些“国家”是在美国的保护下才得以生存的。这倒不完全是假话。美国在南朝鲜、南越等地用刺刀和美元硬撑起来的反动傀儡政权，如李承晚、吴庭艳集团之流，离开了美国是一天也活不下去的。美国对这些亚洲最腐朽、最反动、最黑暗的势力也的确给过不少的“帮助”，但它们由此“壮大”了没有呢？让我们看看被美国誉为“‘自由世界’的陈列橱窗”的南朝鲜吧。在过去的十年中，美国给了李承晚集团二十六亿八千万美元的经济“援助”，十五亿美元的军事“援助”。但南朝鲜只落得个经济破产、民不聊生。目前南朝鲜的民族工业已奄奄一息，工业总产值降到日本统治末期的一半；南朝鲜的农村由过去的“谷仓”变成了“饥饿之乡”。通货膨胀严重，生活费用高涨。据联合国的统计，南朝鲜的国民收入居全世界的末位。失业和半失业的人数占具有劳动能力的人口一半以上。南朝鲜人民形容他们的生活为“四十年来的最深重的民生苦难”；“六百年来最高昂的物价”；“寻找工作，比上天摘星星还难”。贪污、腐烂、反动、专制透顶的李承晚集团，以八万多名警察、特务对人民施行最野蛮的统治，只1958年一年就逮捕和监禁了二十四万多人，平均每一百个人里就有一人受害。即使是西方记者也不能否认李承晚集团统治下的南朝鲜是
  “死亡和垂死的地方”，是“可怕的地狱”，是“十足的警察国家”；认为“美国支持李承晚这样一个可耻的专制制度，是一种恶劣的和有辱人类尊严的行为”。至于吴庭艳集团的境况，也决不比李承晚更好。1958年，美国哈佛大学教授福耳的调查报告写道：尽管在最近的四年里，美国向南越这样小的“国家”提供了十亿美元的“援助”，但南越却发生了“非常严重和不可克服的经济衰退”。美国民主党参议员戈尔承认，美国在南越支持“一个基本上极权的政府，这个政府是在非常困难的情况下工作的。”吴庭艳集团自己的“国家革命报”也不讳言它“无法真正控制许多乡村”，“必须设法争取许多地方的影响”。难怪吴庭艳不得不在他的“总统府”里修筑直升飞机场以防不急之需了。
    尽管有这许多情况，但在美帝国主义看来，李承晚、吴庭艳之流却是最忠实和得力的奴仆。请看，从贯彻艾森豪威尔“亚洲人打亚洲人”的主张到阻挠南北（朝鲜、越南）的和平统一，还有比他们更坚决更彻底的吗？由美国一手装备和训练起来的南朝鲜、南越军队，随时都做好“北进”的准备。美国夸南朝鲜是“进攻中国大陆最好的跳板”；李承晚就立刻把三八线所有的大石头都写上“今天三八线，明天长白山”。美国表示南越应成为“自由世界”的反共前哨；吴庭艳立刻就宣布，“美国的边界已经伸延到越南的十七纬线。”美国以停止“援助”恫吓奉行和平中立政策的柬埔寨王国政府，吴庭艳集团的军队就突然出现在柬埔寨境内。美国所以要对李承晚、吴庭艳这些人类的渣滓备加扶植，不正是为了使他们充当它的侵略工具吗？现在，连美国的议员老爷们也已承认，在远东各地的群众心目中，美国同“军国主义和腐化”中间有一个等号。难道还能期望有人相信他那“帮助生存”之类的鬼话吗？
    美帝国主义在西太平洋这样的横行霸道、进行侵略和扩张活动，损害了亚洲人民的利益，威胁了亚洲的和平和安宁，不能不引起各国人民的强烈反对。今天，从中国、日本到菲律宾、泰国、马来亚的每个角落里，都响起了“美帝国主义滚出西太平洋”的呼声。日本广大人民正在以空前未有的声势坚决进行阻止批准和争取废除日美“共同合作和安全条约”的斗争。日本共产党中央指出，美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人，必须迫使美国撤退军队，撤销军事基地。日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎声言，维护远东和平的基本问题首先是美国从它在冲绳岛和日本的其他部分、中国的台湾、南朝鲜和菲律宾的基地撤退它的军队。“马尼拉纪事报”曾经号召菲律宾人民“尽力揭露美国对菲律宾政策的伪善性，告诉全世界美国在这里的目的……是要利用它的基地永远保持它对我国的宗主权。”“只要美国在菲律宾的任何一寸土地上还享有治外法权，他们就会妨碍菲律宾作为一个独立国家行使自己的主权。”就是在美军严密控制下的南朝鲜，也出现了“美国佬滚回去”的传单；在美国居于“太上皇”地位的南越，发生了向美国“顾问”投掷炸弹的事件。亚洲广大人民对美国侵略者的愤怒心情，可以想见。一位英国记者把这些喻为美国人要注意的“红灯”。不错，正是这样。我们已经一再警告美国侵略者，西太平洋是西太平洋人的西太平洋；西太平洋的事要由西太平洋人自己来管，用不着美帝国主义来加以干涉。美帝国主义迟早一定会被亚洲人民赶回东太平洋的老家去的。
