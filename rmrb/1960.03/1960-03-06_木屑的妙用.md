    Mixing wood shavings, planer shavings, and sawdust, and combining them with blood glue, then high-temperature pressing can produce artificial wood boards (i.e., plywood). It is cold-resistant and heat-insulating, does not expand or contract, and can be used to replace natural wood as a building material, and can also be made into beautiful and sturdy high-end furniture. This plywood can replace sheet metal to make radio speaker casings. According to statistics, Shanghai produces at least 43 million jin of wood shavings and sawdust a year. If all these shavings are pressed into wood chipboard, 40,000 cubic meters of wood can be saved, which is equivalent to the wood needed to build more than 26,000 workshops.

    Wood shavings and sawdust, after being treated with different chemical methods, can be turned into fibers even longer than cotton. This is regenerated fiber, also known as rayon. Rayon, after special processing and spinning, can also be turned into artificial wool. Moreover, wood shavings, after being heated and treated in alkaline solutions or dilute acids, are decomposed into oxalic acid, which is a widely used material in the fiber, textile, and chemical industries.

    Wood shavings can not only replace grain as a raw material for manufacturing alcohol or glucose, but also serve as a good nutrient to promote the development of pigs in the development of pig breeding. Wood shavings, after fermentation, are mixed with bran and sugar cake powder, plus fresh yeast and warm water, and can be used to feed pigs when a wine aroma develops.

    Mixing wood shavings and clay to make bricks results in a lightweight, porous material that does not conduct heat, making houses moisture-proof, cold-proof, and heat-insulating. It can be supplied to electroplating plants, screw factories, etc. as a polishing material, and can also be supplied to printing factories for moisture absorption and prevention of sticking during printing and sizing.

    木屑的妙用
    把木屑、刨花、锯末混合起来，配上血胶，经过高温压榨就能制成人造木板（即胶合板）。它能抗寒保温，不胀不缩，可用来代替天然木材制成建筑材料，还能制成美观坚固的高级家具。这种胶合板可以代替铁皮做收音机的喇叭外壳。据统计，上海一年至少有四千三百万斤木屑、锯末，如果把这些屑末全部压制成木屑板，就可节省四万立方米的木材，相当于建造两万六千多间工房的木材需要。
    木屑、锯末经过不同的化学方法处理后，还能变成甚至比棉花还要长的纤维，这就是再生纤维，也就是人造丝。人造丝经过特殊加工再纺，还可变成人造毛。而且木屑经过在碱液或稀酸内加热处理，分解成草酸，更是纤维工业、纺织和化学工业中广泛应用的物料。
    木屑不但可以代替粮食来做制造酒精或葡萄糖的原料，在发展养猪事业中，还是促使猪只发育的良好营养品。木屑经过发酵处理，混和在麸皮和糖饼粉里，加上鲜酵母和温水，等到发出酒香味就可喂猪。
    用木屑和陶土混合烧砖，质轻，多孔，又不传热，可使房屋防潮，御寒保温。既可供给滚镀厂、螺丝厂等作为抛光物料，又可供给印花厂印花上浆时吸潮和防止粘并。
