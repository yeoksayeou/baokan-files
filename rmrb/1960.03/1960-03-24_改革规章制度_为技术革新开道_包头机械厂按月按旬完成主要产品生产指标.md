Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Electric News. The Baotou Machinery Factory mobilized the masses and promptly innovated enterprise management, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement throughout the factory, and continuously and successfully completed its production plans. By March 18, the factory had completed 90% of its first-quarter production plan, and the output, cost, quality and other indicators of major products were also completed on a monthly and ten-day basis.

In reforming enterprise management, the factory first mobilized the masses of employees, including those in functional departments, to focus on the old rules and regulations that hindered the high-speed progress of the technical innovation movement. They abolished the past system of multi-level approval of employees' innovation proposals and adopted the method of "three levels, one line, and one pole to the end." This method involves establishing innovation support committees or innovation support groups composed of workers, technicians, and leading cadres in the factory, workshops, and teams. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, they formulate unified technical innovation plans based on the problems existing in the production of various workshops and teams throughout the factory. They adopt a system of graded responsibility to combine universal action with centralized leadership. This approach ensures that innovation proposals are accurate and implemented quickly and effectively. Before adopting this new enterprise management system, in January, the factory only implemented a total of 1,100 technical innovation proposals. After adopting the new management system, from February 1st to March 9th, employees submitted a total of 6,746 innovation proposals, implementing 2,280 of them, increasing work efficiency by one to three hundred times, establishing four continuous production lines, automating twenty-three single machines, and increasing the factory's mechanization level by more than 6%.

After a large number of technical innovation proposals were implemented, the original weak links and key production points were broken through, production efficiency increased several times, and new problems continued to emerge, requiring management departments to further organize production in a more in-depth and meticulous manner. The Party committee of this factory called on all employees to participate in enterprise management and to write "one piece of paper, one thing" "small reports" to the management department at any time and anywhere based on the problems found in production. Based on the situations reflected by the employees, the leadership promptly adjusted the labor organization and mobilized everyone to tackle key production issues, completely changing the past situation where management work was only done by a few people in a cold and desolate manner. For example, in the production of radiators, the factory originally had a large casting capacity and a small processing capacity. The workshop leadership first led everyone to tackle the "processing bottleneck," creating a radiator processing machine that increased work efficiency from 180 pieces per day to 380 pieces. Soon, the casting capacity could not keep up with the processing capacity. The "small reports" promptly reflected this problem, and the leadership promptly organized all the workshop employees to work together to achieve continuous production of radiators in one fell swoop, ensuring balanced and leapfrog production. After the masses were mobilized, the employees also took the initiative to establish a technical innovation registration book, recording in detail the original planned man-hours for processing each product and the actual man-hours after technical innovation, and formulating advanced man-hour quotas, so that the management department could not only grasp the overall progress of the product, but also understand the progress of each product in a timely manner, creating conditions for better organization of production.

In the mass innovation of enterprise management, the office staff of this factory also realized twelve major innovations in office work, making office work serve production better. The staff of the finance section collectively created a simple logarithmic table for cost accounting. Using it, workers can calculate the cost of a product in just a few seconds. On the first day of using this logarithmic table, the workers of the twelve-inch water pipe group in the foundry workshop increased their output by 3.2%, reduced the scrap rate by 3%, and reduced the cost by 1.6%, because they can calculate the cost of their own products at any time during production, and everyone is more concerned about the effect of their labor.

    改革规章制度　为技术革新开道
    包头机械厂按月按旬完成主要产品生产指标
    据新华社包头电　包头机械厂发动群众，及时革新企业管理工作，有力地促进了全厂技术革新和技术革命运动的高速度发展，连续出色地完成了生产计划。到3月18日，这个厂第一季度的生产计划已完成90％，主要产品产量成本、质量等指标，也都按月按旬地完成。
    这个厂在革新企业管理中，首先发动全厂职工群众，包括职能科室人员，把矛头指向那些妨碍技术革新运动高速度前进的旧规章制度方面。他们废除了过去对职工革新建议层层审批的制度，采取了“三级一线一竿子扎到底”的办法。这种办法就是在厂部、车间和小组，都设立由工人、技术人员和领导干部参加的革新配套委员会或革新配套小组；在党委统一领导下，根据全厂各车间和小组生产上存在的问题，制定统一的技术革新规划；采取分级负责的办法，使普遍行动和集中领导结合起来。这样做，革新建议提得既准，实现得又快又好。在采取这种新的企业管理制度以前，即在1月份，全厂一共才实现技术革新建议一千一百件。采取新的管理制度以后，从2月1日到3月9日，职工们共提出革新建议六千七百四十六件，实现了二千二百八十件，分别提高工作效率一倍到三百倍，建立了四条连续生产流水线，使二十三项单机实现了自动化，全厂机械化程度提高了6％以上。
    大批技术革新建议实现以后，原有的薄弱环节和生产关键纷纷突破，生产效率成倍提高，新问题不断出现，这就要求管理部门进一步深入细致地组织生产。这个厂的党委号召全体职工，人人参加企业管理，根据生产中发现的问题，随时随地向管理部门写“一片纸一件事”的“小报告”。领导上根据职工们反映的情况，及时调整劳动组织，发动大家围攻生产关键，彻底改变了过去管理工作只由少数人搞的冷冷清清的局面。例如，这个厂在暖气片生产方面，原来是铸造能力大，加工能力小。车间领导方面首先领导大家围攻“加工关”，制成了暖气片加工机，工作效率由每日加工一百八十片提高到三百八十片。不久，出现了铸造能力赶不上加工能力的现象。“小报告”及时反映了这个问题，领导方面又及时组织全车间职工，群策群力，一举实现了暖气片的连续生产，保证了生产的均衡跃进。群众发动起来以后，职工们还主动建立了技术革新登记簿，把加工每一种产品的原计划工时、技术革新以后的实用工时，详细记录下来，制定了先进的工时定额，使管理部门不仅能掌握产品总进度，而且对每一项产品的进度都能及时了解，为更好地组织生产创造了条件。
    这个厂的科室工作人员，在群众性的革新企业管理运动中，还实现了十二项科室工作上的重大革新，使科室工作为生产服务得更好。财务科的工作人员，集体创造了成本核算简易对数表。利用它，工人们只在几秒钟内就可以把产品成本算出来。铸工车间铸十二寸水管小组工人，在使用这种对数表的头一天，就提高产量3．2％，废品率下降3％，成本降低1．6％，因为他们可以在生产中随时核算自己生产产品的成本，大家对自己的劳动效果更加关心。
