Watching the Shanghai People's Art Theater's production of "Dried Trees Revive in Spring" was very exciting. The recent modern drama observation performance organized by the Ministry of Culture, although small-scale with only a portion of drama theaters and troupes participating, powerfully demonstrated the enormous progress of drama since the Great Leap Forward. It closely connects with real life, portraying the spirit of the times and new heroic figures. Significant progress has also been made in the nationalization and mass orientation of form and style. These performances also illustrate that dramatic art is a good weapon for promptly reflecting the current struggle life of the people and conducting communist ideological education among the masses. A number of good plays emerged from this observation performance, and "Dried Trees Revive in Spring" is one of them.

Those who have not grown up in the Jiangnan region do not fully understand the harm of schistosomiasis. After reading Comrade Wei Wenbo's article "Six Hundred Million People Bid Farewell to the God of Plague" in the second issue of "Red Flag" in 1960, I realized that the extent of schistosomiasis-affected areas, the length of its history, and the depth of the people's suffering were almost unimaginable. However, it is a fact. In old China, there was no talk of disease prevention and treatment, and the reactionary rulers themselves were plague germs that killed the people. Reactionary rule and disease were intertwined, and the victims were of course only the common people. New China sent away the god of plague that was pressing down on the people. The people themselves became masters of their own affairs, and the Party led the people to transform society and nature. In terms of transforming nature, unprecedented struggles have been carried out, from disease prevention and treatment to eliminating the four pests, and unprecedented glorious achievements have been obtained. Taking the elimination of schistosomiasis as an example, it is truly a major event in people's lives. Schistosomiasis is no longer an incurable disease, and more importantly, the source of the disease has been eliminated, and nearly 100 million people are no longer threatened by this disease. The disaster areas of the past, once desolate, are now thriving with abundant production. Such a great change is not only gratifying, but also inspires people to generate a sense of pride in the era. I thank the author of "Dried Trees Revive in Spring" for vividly depicting this earth-shaking change through the joys and sorrows of the Ku Meizi family.

The joys and sorrows of the Ku Meizi family are the central events of the play "Dried Trees Revive in Spring." The script is not written for the sake of writing about Ku Meizi, but rather reflects the great victory of the working people in their struggle against the natural disasters left over by the reactionary regime through Ku Meizi's experiences. The script enthusiastically praises the new society and the working people, praises the Party and the wisdom and greatness of the leaders, credibly reflects the great struggle of the people under the leadership of the Party to transform nature in real life, reflects how the bourgeois intellectuals have been transformed, and depicts the concrete application of the Party's formula of unity-struggle-unity and its victory.

The three threads of the play are: the story of Ku Meizi's joys and sorrows; the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods in schistosomiasis prevention and control; and how the Party mobilizes the masses to fight against a disease that has been incurable for generations. Under the guidance of the theme of the two-road struggle, the three threads are interwoven. This expresses the positive significance of the theme more comprehensively and profoundly, and expresses the spirit of Chairman Mao's two poems "Farewell to the God of Plague." The god of plague is schistosomiasis, which must be eliminated. Bourgeois ideology also needs to be thoroughly eradicated. Only by eliminating it thoroughly and eradicating it thoroughly can we fully exploit the potential of production and build socialism more rapidly.

The play creates an image of a grassroots Party leader, Luo Shunde, the head of the schistosomiasis prevention station. He resolutely implements and defends the Party's policies and guidelines in schistosomiasis prevention and control – prevention and treatment, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and integrating production with treatment. He firmly criticizes and struggles against the different erroneous thoughts of Liu Xiang, Aunt Fang, and Uncle Li. However, he puts the policies into action in a vivid and approachable way: his help to Aunt Fang is so vivid and kind. Initially, he does not understand the work, but on matters of principle, he never compromises with bourgeois experts. Although the face-to-face struggle does not seem prominent enough, his criticism of Liu Xiang in the seventh scene is to the point. The creation of this positive character image in the play is successful. The author uses the character's actions to educate people through struggle. For example, his first appearance, carrying a load of luggage for Liu Xiang and other cadres going to the countryside, gives people the image of an ordinary worker. The author's intention is very profound. The author repeats this action, personally carrying back a load of traditional Chinese medicine necessary for late-stage patients from the special district. This detail can be said to depict the spiritual outlook of such a grassroots Party leader in a vivid and definitive way. He is so noble, yet so kind and vividly embodies the Party's infinite concern for the suffering of the people.

The author focuses more on portraying Ku Meizi. Ku Meizi's suffering and illness, and her experiences due to her illness, reflect the fate of the people, especially women, in areas deeply affected by schistosomiasis. The character of Ku Meizi has a basis in real life, and her mental state is sympathetic. Although she has an "incurable disease," she has not given up hope. Especially after being educated and enlightened by the Party, and seeing with her own eyes how the Party resolutely implements the wise decision to cure all patients, she has even more confidence. Unfortunately, when the plot develops to its climax, in order to develop other clues, the resolution of her illness is delayed when Ku Meizi's condition is serious, which makes the audience feel unnatural. The break between Ku Meizi and Dong Ge, from the perspective of the relationship between the characters, is also reasonable. Aunt Fang's demands are unreasonable, and Ku Meizi's ideological level should be higher than that of the older generation of affected women.

The performance by the Shanghai People's Art Theater was warmly welcomed by the audience. The director tightly grasped the main thread of the contradiction and did not dwell on Ku Meizi's "suffering," thus better embodying the theme. The stage art is quite outstanding, rich in local color, and delightful. The only shortcoming is that some actors have relatively skilled acting skills but lack life experience, so their thoughts and feelings are not accurate enough when portraying the image of the working people and Party leaders.

In the second scene, late at night, the county Party committee building is in the distant view, brightly lit. Chairman Mao is holding a meeting there to study schistosomiasis prevention and control work. When the play proceeds to this scene, the audience is very excited. The play and performance well express the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's diligent concern for the lives and production of the people, and also embodies the people's gratitude and love for the Party and the leader.

    看上海人艺演出的“枯木逢春”
    凤子
    看了上海人民艺术剧院创作并演出的“枯木逢春”，很兴奋。最近文化部举办的现代题材话剧观摩演出，虽然是小型的，只有一部分话剧院、团参加，可是它有力地说明了大跃进以来话剧的巨大进步，它密切地联系着现实生活，表现了时代精神和新的英雄人物形象；在形式和风格的民族化、群众化方面，也有了显著的进步。这些演出也说明了话剧艺术是及时地反映当前人民的斗争生活、向群众进行共产主义思想教育的很好的武器。这次观摩演出出现了一些好剧目，“枯木逢春”是其中之一。
    不是在江南地区生长的人，对于血吸虫病的危害性是不够理解的。读了1960年“红旗”第二期魏文伯同志写的“六亿神州送瘟神”这篇文章，才知道血吸虫病疫区之广，历史之长，人民受害之深，几乎是不可想像的。可是，这是事实。在旧中国根本谈不到什么防疫治病，而反动统治者本身就是杀害人民的瘟疫病菌。反动统治和病疫是相互结合的，受害者当然只是老百姓了。新中国送走了压在人民头上的瘟神，人民自己当了家，党领导人民改造社会、改造自然。就改造自然来说，从防疫治病到除四害，进行了史无前例的斗争，而且也获得了史无前例的光辉的成绩。以消灭血吸虫病来说，真是人民生活中一件大事。血吸虫病不再是不治之症了，更重要的是消灭了病源，近亿人口不再受到这个病的威胁。过去的灾害地区，一片荒芜，现在是生产丰收人兴旺。这么伟大的变化，不只是令人欢欣鼓舞而已，人们会油然产生时代的自豪感。感谢“枯木逢春”的作者，通过苦妹子一家的悲欢离合，生动地写出这一翻天复地的变化。
    苦妹子一家的悲欢离合是“枯木逢春”一剧的中心事件。剧本并不是为了写苦妹子而写苦妹子，而是通过苦妹子的遭遇，反映劳动人民在同反动政权遗留下来的自然灾害作斗争的伟大胜利。剧本热情地歌颂了新社会和劳动人民，歌颂了党和领袖的英明伟大，可信地反映了现实生活中人民群众在党领导下进行的改造自然的伟大斗争；反映了资产阶级知识分子怎样得到了改造；描写了党的团结——斗争——团结的公式的具体运用和它的胜利。
    戏的三条线索是：苦妹子的悲欢离合故事；血防工作的土洋结合方针；党如何发动群众同世代以来不治之病作斗争。在两条道路斗争这一主题思想指导下，三条线索交织进行。这就更多方面地、较深刻地表达了主题的积极意义，表现了毛主席“送瘟神”这两首诗的精神。瘟神是血吸虫病，必须加以消灭。资产阶级思想也是需要彻底肃清的。只有消灭得彻底，肃清得彻底，才能充分发挥生产的潜力，才能更迅速地建设社会主义。
    剧本创造了一个党的基层领导者的形象，血防站长罗舜德。他坚决地执行着、保卫着党在血防工作上的政策和路线——防疫和治病，土洋结合、中西医结合，生产同治病并举的精神，坚定地对刘翔、方妈妈、李大爷等不同的错误思想进行批评和斗争。可是，他是那样地把政策化在行动中：对方妈妈的帮助是那样的生动而亲切。最初他不懂业务，可是在原则问题上，他决不迁就资产阶级专家。虽然面对面的斗争似乎不够突出，但第七场他对刘翔的批评是切中要害的。剧本中这一正面人物形象的创造是成功的，通过斗争来刻划人物，作者用人物的行动来教育人们。如他第一次出场，为刘翔等下乡干部挑一担行李，带给人们一个普通劳动者的形象，作者的用意是非常深远的。作者重复了这一动作，他从专区亲自挑回一担晚期病人必须用的中药，这一细节可说是画龙点睛地描绘出这样一位党的基层领导者的精神面貌。他是那样崇高，又那么亲切、生动地体现了党对人民疾苦的无限关心。
    作者比较着力刻划的是苦妹子。苦妹子的苦和病，因病而来的遭遇，反映了受血吸虫病害较深地区的人民的命运，特别是妇女。苦妹子这个人物是有生活基础的，她的精神状态是引人同情的。她虽然有“不治之症”，可是她并未放弃希望，尤其是受到党的教育启发，亲眼看到党如何坚决地执行着治好一切病人这一英明决定，就更有了信心。可惜剧情发展到高潮时，为了其他线索的发展，在苦妹子病情严重的时候，拖延了解决她的病，使观众觉得不大自然。苦妹子和冬哥的决裂，从人物关系看，也是在情理之中，方妈妈的要求不近人情，苦妹子则应该比老一代受害妇女的思想水平高一些。
    上海人民艺术剧院的演出受到了观众的热烈欢迎。导演紧紧地掌握了矛盾的主线，并未在苦妹子的“苦”上做文章，因而较好地体现了主题。舞台美术相当出色，富于地方色彩，令人喜爱。美中不足的是有的演员有较纯熟的演技而生活不足，因而表现劳动人民、党的领导者的形象时，思想感情就不够准确了。
    第二场深夜，远景是县委大楼，灯光明亮，毛主席正召集会议，在那里研究血防工作；戏进行到这一场景，观众都非常激动。剧本和演出很好地表现了党中央、毛主席宵衣旰食地关心着人民的生活和生产，同时也体现了人民对党、对领袖的感激和爱戴。
