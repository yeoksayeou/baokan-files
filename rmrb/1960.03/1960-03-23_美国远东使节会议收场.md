Xinhua News Agency, Baguio, 18th: The U.S. envoys to the Far East concluded their four-day secret meeting in Baguio, Philippines, on the 17th.

The meeting only issued a very brief communique, without revealing the contents of the meeting.

But according to the Associated Press, the main content of this meeting was to plan new conspiracies against China. It said, "The central topic of this meeting was Communist China." It said that U.S. envoys to the Far East are "more determined than in the past" to oppose recognizing China, and "they generally believe that the U.S. policy in Asia should be to hold the anti-communist front." The Associated Press also revealed that the conspirators participating in this meeting believed that the U.S. policy in Asia was to provoke countries in the region against China. But the Associated Press said that they all acknowledged that China's influence is far-reaching. They are worried that they cannot undermine China's prestige.

    美国远东使节会议收场
    新华社18日讯　碧瑶消息：美国驻远东地区的使节17日结束了他们在菲律宾碧瑶举行的四天秘密会议。
    会议只发表了极简短的公报，没有透露会议的内容。
    但是据美联社透露，这次会议的主要内容是策划对付中国的新阴谋。它说，“这次会议的中心议题是共产党中国”。它说，美国驻远东各地的使节“比过去更坚决地”反对承认中国，“他们普遍认为，美国在亚洲的政策应当是守住反共阵线”。美联社并透露，参加这次会议的阴谋家们认为，美国在亚洲的政策是要挑拨这一地区的国家同中国的关系。但是美联社说，他们都承认中国的影响是深远的。他们担心无法破坏中国的威望。
