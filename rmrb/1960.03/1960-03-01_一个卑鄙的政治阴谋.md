    A Base Political Conspiracy
    By Staff Commentator
    The American chairman of the International Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage, issued a statement on February 16, announcing that the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan would be allowed to participate in the 17th Olympic Games, and that the issue of admitting the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the name of the so-called "Republic of China Olympic Committee" would be discussed at the next meeting of the International Olympic Committee. This is a base political conspiracy. Brundage's plan is to first have the Chiang Kai-shek clique participate in the Olympic Games, creating a fait accompli, and then manipulate the International Olympic Committee to illegally admit the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, thereby continuing to serve the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas."
    Under the instructions of the U.S. government, Brundage has long abused his authority as chairman of the International Olympic Committee to engage in the political conspiracy of "two Chinas" in international sports activities. In protest against Brundage's illegal activities, the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) solemnly announced in August 1958 that it would sever all relations with the International Olympic Committee. However, since then, Brundage has not stopped his activities to create "two Chinas," but has only resorted to some new tricks due to the situation. In view of the firm demands of the sports organizations of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and many impartial people in the sports world of various countries who are loyal to the Olympic spirit to expel the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the International Olympic Committee, Brundage proposed a resolution at the 55th meeting of the International Olympic Committee in 1959, requiring the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to change their name, not using "Chinese National Olympic Committee," but using other names to participate in the International Olympic Committee. It is very clear that this is actually still a trick of changing the soup but not the medicine; Brundage attempts to allow Taiwan to participate in the International Olympic Committee as an "independent political entity" separate from China, thereby creating a de facto "two Chinas" situation in international sports activities. However, Brundage's statement on February 16 shows that he doesn't even want to play this trick of changing the soup but not the medicine anymore. Brundage simply doesn't intend to change the soup, he changed the so-called "Chinese National Olympic Committee" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's sports organization to the so-called "Republic of China Olympic Committee"! Brundage is really unchanging in his essence, changing back and forth, and in the final analysis, he is still playing the conspiracy of "two Chinas."
    Just like in the past, Brundage's statement on February 16 was issued entirely in accordance with the wishes of the U.S. State Department. After Brundage was forced to propose a resolution last year to require the sports organizations of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to change their name, the U.S. State Department, which had nothing to do with this matter, issued "statements" and talks again and again, exerting blatant pressure, demanding that the International Olympic Committee still allow the Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate in the International Olympic Committee under the name of "China." Brundage acted according to the wishes of the U.S. State Department. His shameful statement on February 16 can only further prove that he is implementing the U.S. State Department's policy of hostility towards the People's China.
    For many years, in order to persist in its policy of hostility towards China, and at the same time attempt to find a way out of the dead end of this policy, U.S. imperialism has been doing everything possible to carry out conspiracy activities to create "two Chinas." The United States is trying its best to put the Taiwan Kuomintang clique in opposition to the People's China in various international organizations and international activities, which is one of its specific steps. However, no matter what form this conspiracy of the United States takes, no matter how clever tricks it adopts, it is destined to fail completely. There is only one China, that is, the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and no one can separate it from China by any means. Taiwan's sports organizations can only be a local organization of the All-China Sports Federation. It is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people for international sports organizations to allow Taiwan to participate in activities separately under any name and in any way. The "two Chinas" conspiracy of Brundage and his masters is an illusion that can never be realized.

    一个卑鄙的政治阴谋
    本报评论员
    国际奥林匹克委员会的美国主席布伦戴奇在2月16日发表声明，宣布允许台湾蒋介石集团的体育组织参加第十七届奥林匹克运动会，并准备在国际奥委会的下一届会议上讨论以所谓“中华民国奥委会”的名义接纳蒋介石集团的问题。这是一个卑鄙的政治阴谋。布伦戴奇的打算是，首先要蒋介石集团参加奥林匹克运动会，造成既成事实，然后再操纵国际奥委会非法接纳蒋介石集团的体育组织，从而继续为美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。
    在美国官方的指使下，布伦戴奇滥用国际奥委会主席的职权，在国际体育活动中玩弄“两个中国”的政治阴谋，由来已久。为了抗议布伦戴奇的这种非法活动，中国奥委会（中华全国体育总会）已于1958年8月严正宣布同国际奥委会断绝一切关系。但是，在这以后，布伦戴奇仍然没有停止制造“两个中国”的活动，而只是迫于形势，耍了一些新的花招。鉴于苏联等社会主义国家体育组织和各国体育界的许多忠于奥林匹克精神的公正人士，坚决要求把蒋介石集团体育组织逐出国际奥委会，布伦戴奇又在1959年国际奥委会的第五十五届会议上提出一个决议，要蒋介石集团的体育组织改换名称，不用“中华全国奥委会”，而用其他名义参加国际奥委会。非常明显，这实际上仍然是一种换汤不换药的把戏；布伦戴奇企图让台湾作为一个脱离中国而独立存在的“政治单位”，来参加国际奥委会，从而在国际体育活动中在事实上形成“两个中国”的局面。可是，布伦戴奇2月16日的声明表明，他甚至连这种换汤不换药的把戏也不想玩下去了。布伦戴奇索性连汤也不打算换了，他把蒋介石集团体育组织的所谓“中华全国奥委会”字样改为所谓“中华民国奥委会”字样！布伦戴奇真是万变不离其宗，变来变去，归根结底还是玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋。
    和过去的情况一模一样，布伦戴奇2月16日的声明，是完全秉承美国国务院的意旨而发表的。在去年布伦戴奇被迫提出要台湾蒋介石集团体育组织改换名称的决议以后，和这件事毫不相干的美国国务院曾经三番五次发表“声明”和谈话，施加露骨的压力，要国际奥委会仍然允许蒋介石集团用“中国”名义参加国际奥委会。布伦戴奇就是根据美国国务院的意旨行事的。他的2月16日的可耻声明，只能进一步证明他执行的是美国国务院的敌视人民中国的政策。
    多年以来，美帝国主义为了坚持它的敌视中国的政策，同时又企图从这个政策的死胡同中寻找出路，一直在千方百计地进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。美国极力想在各种国际组织和国际活动中摆出台湾国民党集团同人民中国相对抗，就是它的具体步骤之一。但是，不管美国的这种阴谋以什么方式出现，不管它采取多么巧妙的花招，它都是注定要彻底失败的，中国只有一个，就是中华人民共和国。台湾是中国领土的一部分，任何人用什么办法也不能使它从中国分割出去。台湾的体育组织，只能是中华全国体育总会的一个地方组织。国际体育组织不论用任何名义和任何方式容许台湾单独参加活动，都是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。布伦戴奇之流和他们的主子的“两个中国”的阴谋是永远无法实现的幻想。
