Xinhua News Agency, Athens, March 28th: TASS reports: It was announced here that the Greek Supreme Court decided on March 26th to reject the appeals of Glezos and other democrats. Disregarding the will of the public in Greece and the world, as well as the opinions of Greek and foreign lawyers, the Greek Supreme Court approved the unjust judgment of the Athens Military Court against Glezos and other patriotic fighters. This judgment was made based on the so-called "espionage" charges fabricated by the political police. Greek democrats have stated that they will continue to mobilize all forces to fight for the release of Glezos.

    希腊当局无理驳回格列索斯的上诉
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社雅典28日讯：这里宣布，希腊最高法院3月26日决定驳回格列索斯和其他一些民主人士的上诉。希腊最高法院不顾希腊和世界的公众意志以及希腊和外国的律师的意见，批准了雅典军事法庭对格列索斯和其他爱国志士的不公正判决，这种判决是根据政治警察捏造的所谓“进行间谍活动”罪名而作出的。希腊民主人士声明表示将继续动员一切力量争取释放格列索斯。
