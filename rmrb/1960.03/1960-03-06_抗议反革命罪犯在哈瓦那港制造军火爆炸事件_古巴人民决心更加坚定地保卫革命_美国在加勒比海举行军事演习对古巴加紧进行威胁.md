Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 5th: Havana residents from all social strata are indignantly protesting the heinous crime committed by foreign criminals and counter-revolutionaries, who, after continuously bombing sugarcane fields, injured more than one hundred Cuban dockworkers who were unloading ammunition on the docks.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation ordered a general strike in all trades and industries in Havana Province on the 5th to mourn the martyred workers. Service industries and departments such as water and electricity, transportation, and radio stations will not hold strikes. The rest of the country will hold a five-minute strike.

A large number of workers, employees, small businessmen, and taxi drivers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Rebel Army Television Station, vowing to donate twice the amount of their previous donations to the state in order to purchase weapons again to defend the revolution. They also pledged to raise funds to assist the victims. Spanish Republicans exiled here also donated money.

Beque, the General Secretary of the National Sugar Workers' Federation, appealed through television for sugar workers to double their efforts during this sugar harvest season, firmly support the government, and defeat the enemy's sabotage and aggression plots.

An elderly woman over seventy years old put five pesos into the donation box with her trembling hands at midnight yesterday, solemnly raising her arm and saying, "For the entire Cuban people, forward revolution! Forward Fidel!"

Representatives of the workers at the Hilton Hotel, faced with this destruction by the enemy, said that we will more firmly defend the revolution.

A large number of telegrams condemning the enemy's crimes were sent from all over the country.

It is reported that the bodies of the workers who died in the explosion have been moved to the Cuban Workers' Confederation Building. Workers filled the headquarters of the Cuban Workers' Confederation to participate in the wake and condolences.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 4th: A ship carrying sixty-five tons of weapons to the Cuban revolutionary government—the "La Coubre"—exploded in Havana Harbor this afternoon. The ship was flying the French flag. The explosion damaged port buildings. It is estimated that more than one hundred people were killed or injured in the explosion.

President Dorticos, Prime Minister Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces Raul Castro, and other senior government officials and officers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces rushed to the scene to inspect. The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces has ordered all military personnel to be on emergency alert.

Cuban President Dorticos announced through television in the presidential palace after an emergency cabinet meeting on the explosion that "all the characteristics show that it was a barbaric crime against the Cuban people." He said that the authorities are conducting a thorough investigation.

Tens of thousands of Havana residents lined up in long queues at all medical stations, preparing to donate blood for the injured. All doctors, nurses, and medical students are participating in rescuing the injured.

The Cuban cabinet decided to allocate one million pesos to help the victims and their families. They will receive special pensions and housing. Those who lose their ability to work due to the explosion will receive special pensions. The state will be responsible for the upbringing of the victims' children and will donate ten thousand pesos to the crew and families of the French ship involved in the accident.

The Cuban cabinet has ordered the nation to mourn the victims for twenty-four hours.

Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: Washington news: According to the United States Information Agency, the United States government has decided to hold a large-scale military exercise in Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea for fifteen days, starting on the 8th. 22,500 troops will participate in this military exercise, and these troops will be transported from fourteen locations in the United States to Puerto Rico by 483 transport aircraft.

This U.S. military exercise is another deliberate act of military threat against the national independence movement in Latin America. According to the U.S. "New York Post" earlier, the primary purpose of the military exercise is to "make it clear to the Castro government and Panamanian nationalists that the United States can mobilize large numbers of troops and heavy weapons to these countries in a matter of hours."
