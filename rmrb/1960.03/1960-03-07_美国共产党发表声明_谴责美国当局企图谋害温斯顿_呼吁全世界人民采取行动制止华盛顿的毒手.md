　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th dispatch: According to TASS, New York: The American Communist Party issued a statement on the 5th, exposing the US government's conspiracy to send Henry Winston, a Black leader of the American Communist Party, back to prison from the hospital. Winston is still in critical condition after undergoing major surgery at a New York hospital to remove a serious brain tumor.

　　It is reported that US government prison officials are preparing to snatch Winston from his hospital bed in New York City and take him to a prison far away in Missouri. The American Communist Party pointed out that this action by the US government amounts to "murdering" Winston.

　　The American Communist Party's statement said: "[The US government] is taking such brutal action because he (Winston) is a Black man. This action is consistent with the brutal actions [the US government] is committing against Black people at this time, especially in the South."

　　The statement accuses prison officials of taking such action, disregarding a letter from a prominent specialist at a New York hospital who "informed the US government that Winston is still in critical condition, continues to have a fever, is blind in both eyes, and is paralyzed in both legs." The statement said: "The specialist also told the US government that when Winston can be discharged from the hospital in the future, he can only be sent to a medical institution, otherwise his life will be endangered.

　　"However, the US government is taking action that endangers Winston's risk of cerebral hemorrhage after brain tumor removal surgery. The government is carrying out such a plot, regardless of widespread opposition at home and abroad to sending Winston back to prison."

　　The statement concludes: "We call on people around the world to take action to demand that the US President and government stop this extremely dangerous action."

    美国共产党发表声明
    谴责美国当局企图谋害温斯顿
    呼吁全世界人民采取行动制止华盛顿的毒手
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党5日发表声明，揭露美国政府企图把美共黑人领袖亨利·温斯顿从医院送回监狱的阴谋。温斯顿在纽约一家医院进行切除严重的脑瘤的大手术后，至今尚未脱离危险状态。
    据报道，美国政府的监狱官员们正在准备把温斯顿从纽约市的一家医院病床上劫走而把他带到远在密苏里的一个监狱里去。美国共产党指出，美国政府的这一行动意味着“谋害”温斯顿。
    美国共产党的声明说：“（美国政府）采取这样残暴的行动是因为他（温斯顿）是一个黑人。这种行动和（美国政府）在这个时候特别是在南部干下的对黑人的残暴行动相一致的。”
    声明指责监狱官员们采取这样的行动，而不顾纽约医院里一位著名的专科医师在信里“通知美国政府温斯顿还处于危险状态、继续发烧、双目失明和双腿瘫痪”的这种情况。声明说：“这位专科医师还告诉美国政府说，在温斯顿将来可以出院的时候，他也只能被送到医疗机构去，否则就要危及他的生命。
    “但是，美国政府正在进行使温斯顿在割除脑瘤手术后冒脑溢血危险的行动。政府是不顾国内外普遍反对把温斯顿送回监狱的要求，而进行着这样的勾当的。”
    声明最后说：“我们呼吁全世界人民采取行动，要求美国总统和政府停止这种极端危险的行动。”
