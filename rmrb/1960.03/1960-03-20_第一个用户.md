    The First User
    Ma Jun
    Night fell, and the streets of Baoding were bustling with people. We passed through several streets and alleys and arrived at the Baoding Velvet Weaving Factory. It is the first user of China's first rayon factory—the Baoding Chemical Fiber Factory.

    As soon as we said that we came from the Chemical Fiber Factory to see the rayon, a young man couldn't help but say to us: "Great, the rayon from the Chemical Fiber Factory! We use their silk to weave velvet!" Walking into the office, the young man took out his two paper folders from the drawer. When we opened them, they were full of colorful velvet swatches. There was shimmering gold velvet, plaid upright velvet suitable for children's clothing, and georgette velvet with a light cyan gauze base and golden velvet flowers...

    "Are you a salesperson?" we asked curiously.

    "No, I'm a statistician," the young man replied. He was afraid that we wouldn't understand why he collected so many samples, so he added, "These velvets are so beautiful! I love them."

    As we were talking, someone next to us brought over a large pile of velvet samples: "Look, the patterns are all here!" Sure enough, these velvets were truly fascinating. On the sky-blue velvet base, a trace of curved white lines was revealed, and the ends of the lines were mixed with some red dots, just like festive fireworks sprinkling down on the blue sky in front of Tiananmen Square; on the white velvet surface, crimson seeped out from dark to light, just like the sky before sunrise; on the rose-colored velvet surface, shadows of flowers with slightly darker tones were烫 out, shimmering with different luster under the light; on the coral-colored upright velvet, black lines interwoven into a chessboard, and at the intersection of every two black lines, there were fine yellow dots inlaid, emitting starlight-like brilliance... Can you believe it? This is the velvet woven from silk extracted from wood! Touch it, it's so soft and smooth! Isn't this the velvet curtain you see in the theater, the dazzling gold velvet in department store counters, and the georgette velvet that female comrades love most!

    How can such beautiful velvet not be loved! Who wouldn't want to store them as works of art like the statistician! However, the statistician and the veteran workers here also love it for another reason. The factory director, a veteran velvet weaver, told us: "I have woven velvet for decades, using rayon from England, Japan, and Italy, but I have never used rayon from my own country. Now we don't have to worry about not having rayon produced by ourselves. Our rayon is softer and more uniform than the British Pagoda brand rayon!" This is their true joy, and it is also the "appraisal" given by the first user to the first batch of rayon produced by our country. (Attached picture)

    夜幕降临了，保定市的大街上，人群熙来攘往。穿过几条大街小巷，我们到了保定市织绒厂。它就是我国第一个人造丝厂——保定化学纤维厂的第一个用户。
    我们才说是从化学纤维厂看了人造丝来的，一个小伙子就情不自禁地向我们说：“好呵，化学纤维厂的人造丝！我们就用他们的丝织绒哩！”走进了办公室，小伙子从抽屉里拿出了他的两个纸夹来。我们打开一看，全是五光十色的小绒块。有闪闪发光的金丝绒，有适合小孩做衣帽的方格立绒，有淡青色纱底，植着金黄色绒花的乔琪绒……
    “你是推销员吗？”我们好奇地问。
    “不，我是统计员。”小伙子回答说。他还怕我们不理解他为什么要收藏这许多样品，又补充说：“这些绒太美啦！我爱它们。”
    我们正谈着话，不知旁边的谁又去抱了一大堆绒样来：“看，这儿花样才全呢？”果然，这些绒实在叫人着迷。天蓝色的绒底上，透出了一丝丝弯曲的白色细线，线端还杂着一些红色的圆点，就像是节日的礼花在天安门前的蓝天上洒下了一样；白色的绒面上，浸出了由深到浅的绯红，恰像朝日升起以前的天边；玫瑰色的绒面上烫出了色调稍深一点的阴花，在灯光下闪动着不同的光泽；珊瑚色的立绒上，嵌的黑色线条交织成一个棋盘，每两条黑线交合的地方，又镶着细细的黄点，放着金星般的光辉……你相信么？这就是木材抽出来的丝，织成的绒！摸摸它吧，是多么柔和、细软！这不就是你在剧场里看到丝绒吊幕，百货公司的柜台里光彩夺目的金丝绒，女同志们最喜欢的乔琪绒！
    这样美丽的绒，怎么不叫人喜爱！谁又不愿像统计员那样，把它们当做艺术品存放起来！但是，这儿的统计员、老工人们喜爱它还有着另外的原因。这里的厂长、一位织绒老工人告诉我们：“我织了几十年绒，用过英国的、日本的、意大利的人造丝，就没有用过自己国家的人造丝，现在我们可是不愁没有自己生产的人造丝用了。我们的人造丝比英国宝塔牌人造丝质地柔和，条杆均匀！”这是他们的真正喜悦，也是第一个用户给我国自己生产的第一批人造丝作的“鉴定”。（附图片）
