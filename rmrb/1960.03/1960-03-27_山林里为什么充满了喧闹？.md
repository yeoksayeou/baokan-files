　　Night fog is hazy and the sky is not yet bright,
　　Why is the mountain forest full of noise?
　　There are songs, laughter, and loud slogans mixed in,
　　Scaring the roosting birds to fly in all directions...
　　This is the commune's fertilizer-collecting army gathering green manure,
　　Demanding fertilizer from barren mountains, wild valleys, and miscellaneous woods.
　　The revolutionary drive of the commune members is higher than the sky,
　　Eating at the third watch, setting off at the fourth, and arriving at the fifth.
　　The Party committee secretary personally takes command,
　　The production team leader charges into battle, displaying heroism.
　　Everyone strives to be the first, tireless,
　　The labor competition has sufficient drive and high enthusiasm.
　　Red scarves climb to the tops of tall trees,
　　Women's teams sweep the fallen leaves in the forest,
　　Youth shock brigades wield knives to cut through the undergrowth,
　　In an instant, fallen leaves pile up like mountains for green manure.
　　Fallen leaves pile up like mountains for green manure,
　　The fertilizer transport team is busy running back and forth, quickly.
　　The fertilizer transport carts run as fast as birds,
　　Squeak, squeak, the cheerful little tune resounds throughout the village roads.
　　The setting sun is slanting, and a pale yellow new moon hangs on the treetops,
　　The Party committee secretary summarizes and reports good news in the forest:
　　The mass movement's method of collecting fertilizer in a concentrated effort is good,
　　Breaking through the leap forward target for the whole month's fertilizer collection in one day.
　　Applause thunders, and cheers shake the clouds,
　　Drums and gongs are noisy, and songs and laughter never leave their mouths.
　　The fertilizer-collecting army assembles and victoriously returns to the dining hall,
　　The cooks have prepared fragrant vegetables and hot meals to reward the great army...

    山林里为什么充满了喧闹？
    芳草
    夜雾迷蒙天未晓，
    山林里为什么充满了喧闹？
    有歌声有欢笑还夹杂着宏亮的口号，
    把宿鸟惊得四散飞逃……
    这是公社积肥大军正在把绿肥搞，
    向荒山野谷杂树林子要肥料。
    公社社员革命干劲比天高，
    三更吃饭四更出发五更就来到。
    党委书记亲自上阵挂了帅，
    生产队长冲锋陷阵逞英豪。
    人人奋勇当先不知倦，
    劳动竞赛干劲足来热气高。
    红领巾爬上高树梢，
    妇女队林间把落叶扫，
    青年突击手挥刀斩林莽，
    一刹时落叶纷纷绿肥积得山样高。
    落叶纷纷绿肥积得山样高，
    忙煞了运肥队来回急忙飞快跑。
    运肥小车快跑如飞鸟，
    吱咕吱咕愉快的小曲儿响彻乡村道。
    夕阳西坠淡黄新月挂树梢，
    党委书记林间总结传捷报：
    群众运动突击积肥办法好，
    一天就突破全月积肥的跃进指标。
    掌声如雷欢呼声震云霄，
    锣鼓喧天歌声笑声不离口。
    积肥大军整队胜利回食堂，
    炊事员早备好香菜热饭把大军劳……
