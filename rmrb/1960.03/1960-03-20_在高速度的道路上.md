    On the High-Speed Road
    Yu Yaling
    After the bugle sounded,
    These days, the factory newspaper's layout seems to have become much smaller. Every day when the pages are ready, I feel that there are still many news stories that should be reported that haven't been. How many new creations appear in our factory every day! Every creation is closely linked to the word "ahead of schedule."
    Dozens of installation teams across the factory have formed a complex network of crisscrossing construction, chasing and catching up with each other. Those with installation conditions are working day and night to catch up, while those without installation conditions are racking their brains to create conditions for early installation. With the accelerated pace of pipeline installation, flange gaskets couldn't keep up with the installation needs. The workers of the second team of the process pipe installation team boldly added a claw-shaped rotary cutting knife to the German drill press, turning manual flange gasket cutting into mechanical rotary cutting, immediately increasing efficiency by forty-eight times, meeting production needs. Using a hacksaw to cut lead pipes was inefficient and wasted saw blades, so the electricians created a toothless electric saw, increasing the efficiency of cutting lead pipes by twenty-nine times. To compete with time for efficiency, veteran worker Tian Qingde felt that cutting iron with an electric saw was too slow and came up with a new method of cutting iron with a punch press, increasing the efficiency from cutting nine irons per minute to forty. New creations keep emerging one after another, just as the workers described: "The process team has many heroes, and miracles come one after another; what's new before a meal is outdated after a meal!"
    More than three thousand employees throughout the factory are listening attentively to the Party's call to advance. Once the Party's ideology is accepted by the masses, it becomes the driving force for creation, innovation, and high-speed factory construction.
    Combining Foreign and Indigenous Methods to Break Through the First Barrier
    The original construction schedule was no longer feasible. To put parts of the factory into production ahead of schedule, the old spinning drums in the original liquid workshop had to be installed in advance; without them, the main raw material for manufacturing rayon—viscose—could not be produced. Installing the old spinning drums was the first hurdle encountered in putting the factory into production ahead of schedule.
    However, the old spinning drums were twenty-six meters long, more than three meters in diameter, and weighed nearly one hundred tons. The original design called for two giant tower cranes to hoist them to a building more than twenty meters high. To install them ahead of schedule, but without the lifting equipment, what should be done? The lifting workers said, "Anyway, it's just lifting! If we don't have foreign equipment, can't we combine foreign and indigenous methods? Can't several small ones together lift a big one?"
    They got together and discussed it for a long time, first conducted a model experiment, and then used two winches with a capacity of only three tons plus some thick wooden poles for lifting, and used steel plates smeared with oil as automatic sliders. Although the winch groaned when lifting the old spinning drum, it was finally hoisted up, ensuring the supply of viscose needed for production.
    The news of the successful lifting of the old spinning drums immediately spread throughout the factory, and people were excited about breaking through this difficult barrier: "In the end, 'walking on two legs' is faster. Relying on only one leg would have left the old spinning drums lying on the ground!"
    Turning the Complex into Simple
    As soon as I got to work, Xiao Xie from the Youth League Committee said, "The sheet metal group has a news story." I took my notebook and headed to the sheet metal group's construction site. I knew their task was tight this month. The entire group had a total of only two thousand nine hundred plus work hours, and to make the sheet metal ductwork ahead of schedule, creating conditions for the air conditioning installation work, they had to complete more than five thousand work hours. However, bending the edges of sheet metal pipes was a delicate job, and in the past, skilled workers had to use wooden mallets to hammer them out one by one. Like the rest of the factory, their group had very few skilled workers, and the vast majority were apprentices. More than eight hundred meters of ductwork required more than one thousand three hundred sheets of sheet metal. How long would it take relying solely on a few skilled workers?
    When I arrived at the construction site, it was really amusing. Group leader Lu Jinkai was feeding a sheet of iron into a small machine. I heard a "whoosh" sound, and a neat iron edge had already been bent out, taking only three minutes in total.
    This is indeed a good news story; it is a microcosm of the efforts of all our factory workers to strive for high speed. Our factory has come from construction to production along this road.

    在高速度的道路上
    于雅玲
    号角响了以后
    这些天来，厂报的版面好像变得小了许多似的，每天成版的时候，都觉着还有许多应当上报的新闻没有上报。每天，我们厂里要出现多少新的创造啊！每一个创造，都和“提前”这个字眼紧密相连。
    全厂几十个安装小组组成了一个前赶后追，错纵复杂的交叉施工网，有安装条件的，在日夜猛追猛赶，没有安装条件的，就千方百计地开动着脑筋，创造提前安装的条件。管道安装工作加快了，法兰垫圈跟不上安装需要了，工艺管安装队第二小组的工人们就大胆地在德国钻床上添了一只爪形旋割刀，把手工剪法兰垫圈变成了机械旋割，工效立刻提高四十八倍，满足了生产需要。用钢锯锯铅管效率低又费锯条，电工们就创造出一种无齿电锯，把锯铅管的效率提高了二十九倍。要和时间争效率，老工人田庆德嫌电锯切铁也太慢，想出了用冲床切铁的新办法，把每分钟切九根铁的效率提高到四十根。新的创造一个连着一个，真像工人们描绘的一样：“工艺队，英雄多，奇迹一个连一个；饭前还是新鲜事，饭后已成过时货！”
    全厂三千多职工都在谛听着党的前进号声，党的思想一经群众接受，就成了创造、革新、高速度建厂的动力。
    洋土结合破头关
    按照原来的施工进度不行了。要提前部分投入生产，就必须提前把原液车间的老成鼓安装起来，没有它就不能生产制造人造丝的主要原料——粘胶。安装老成鼓是提前投入生产遇到的第一道关口。
    但是，老成鼓身长二十六米，直径三米多，重量近一百吨，原设计是要用两台巨型塔式起重机吊装到二十多米的高楼上去的。要提前安装，吊装设备又没有，怎么办呢？吊装工人说：“横竖是吊装呗！没有洋设备，咱来个洋土结合不行？几个小的加在一起吊大的不行？”
    他们大伙凑在一块合计了半天，先搞了个模型试验，然后就用两台只有三吨能力的卷扬机加上一些粗木杆子吊装，用钢板抹上油做自动滑送器，虽然卷扬机吊装老成鼓时呜呜地直喘气，可是终于把老成鼓吊装上去了，保证了提供生产时需要的粘胶。
    老成鼓吊装成功的消息立刻飞遍全厂，人们都为突破这道难关感到振奋：“到底‘两条腿走路’快，要靠一条腿，还得让老成鼓在地下躺着呢！”
    叫复杂的变简单
    刚上班，团委会小谢说：“钣金组出了新闻。”我带上本子就往钣金组工地走。我知道他们这个月任务挺紧，全组总共只有二千九百多个工时，要使白铁管风道制作任务赶在前面，为空气调节安装工作创造条件，他们必须完成五千多个工时的任务。可是，做白铁管弯边工作是个细活，过去都是技工用木鎯头一下下地敲打出来。他们组和全厂一样，技工很少，绝大部分都是徒工，八百多米风道要用一千三百多张白铁皮，光靠几个技工，得花多少时日？
    到了工地，可真叫人乐了。小组长卢金恺正拿着一张铁皮往一架小机器里喂，只听见“哗啦”一声，一道整齐的铁皮边早就弯出来了，总共只花了三分钟。
    这确实是条好新闻，它是我们全厂职工力争高速度的缩影。我们的工厂从建设到生产就是沿着这条道路走过来的。
