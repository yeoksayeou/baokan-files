Comrades,

I represent the State Council in presenting to the conference the draft of the 1960 national economic plan for deliberation.

I

In 1959, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in our country adhered to the general line for socialist construction, maintained the speed of the Great Leap Forward, persisted in the people's communes, and launched a mass movement to oppose the rightist tendency, boost morale, and increase production and economize. We exceeded the adjusted targets of the 1959 plan approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in August 1959. Thus, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we achieved another Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1959 and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for the people of our country and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.

According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, in 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our country reached 241.3 billion yuan, an increase of 31.1% over the 184.1 billion yuan in 1958. Of this, the total industrial output value reached 163 billion yuan, an increase of 39.3% over the 117 billion yuan in 1958; the total agricultural output value reached 78.3 billion yuan, an increase of 16.7% over the 67.1 billion yuan in 1958. The total investment in basic construction within the state budget amounted to 26.7 billion yuan (excluding approximately 5 billion yuan of investment raised by local governments and enterprises), an increase of 24.5% over the 21.4 billion yuan in 1958. The total number of basic construction projects above the limit (Note) was 1,341, of which 671 were fully or partially completed and put into production; the total number of basic construction projects below the limit established by counties and above was 75,000, of which 54,000 were completed. The total volume of goods transported by various means of transport reached 22.12 billion tons, an increase of 67% over the 13.24 billion tons in 1958. Of this, the volume of goods transported by railways reached 5.42 billion tons, an increase of 42% over the 3.81 billion tons in 1958. The total retail sales of social commodities reached 63.8 billion yuan, an increase of 16.4% over the 54.8 billion yuan in 1958. The national income for this year increased by 21.6% over 1958. These figures show that all economic sectors achieved a Great Leap Forward in 1959. While the economy was rapidly developing, the fields of science, education, culture, sports, and health also made great strides.

(Note) To facilitate the classification and management of basic construction units, the state has set investment limits for various types of basic construction units. For example: the investment limit for an iron and steel integrated enterprise is 20 million yuan; the investment limit for the automobile manufacturing industry, tractor manufacturing industry, and coal mining industry is 10 million yuan; the investment limit for the textile industry, paper industry, salt industry, and sugar industry is 5 million yuan; the investment limit for a reservoir is 20 million yuan; and so on. A construction unit whose total investment equals or exceeds the limit is a construction unit above the limit; a construction unit whose total investment is below the limit is a construction unit below the limit.

In 1959, our great ally, the Soviet Union, and other brother countries continued to provide us with tremendous assistance. This assistance played a significant role in the continued Great Leap Forward of our national economy.

Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1958 and 1959, we completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy (1958-1962) three years ahead of schedule. The control figures for the Second Five-Year Plan were proposed by the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in September 1956 and approved by the State Council in February 1957. The control figures for the Second Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1962 should increase by about 75% over 1957, but by 1959, it had already increased by 94.4% over 1957; the total industrial output value should double, but by 1959, it had already increased by 131.5%; the total agricultural output value should increase by about 35%, but by 1959, it had already increased by 45.8%; the national income should increase by about 50%, but by 1959, it had already increased by 62.86%.

For the main industrial and agricultural products, most of them had already reached or exceeded the 1962 targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan in 1959. The Second Five-Year Plan control figures included 24 types of industrial and agricultural products, and by 1959, 13 types had already reached or exceeded the original targets, and 2 more were close to the original targets. These 15 types of products, the planned 1962 output compared with the actual 1959 output are as follows: steel (excluding pig iron), planned to reach 10.5 to 12 million tons, actually reached 13.35 million tons; raw coal, planned to reach 1.9 to 2.1 billion tons, actually reached 3.478 billion tons; electricity generation, planned to reach 40 to 43 billion kWh, actually reached 41.5 billion kWh; metallurgical equipment, planned to reach 30,000 to 40,000 tons, actually reached 205,000 tons; electricity generation equipment, planned to reach 1.4 to 1.5 million kW, actually reached 2.15 million kW; metal cutting machine tools, planned to reach 60,000 to 65,000 units, actually reached 70,000 units; timber, planned to reach 31 to 34 million cubic meters, actually reached 41.2 million cubic meters; cement, planned to reach 12.5 to 14.5 million tons, actually reached 12.27 million tons; cotton yarn, planned to reach 8 to 9 million pieces, actually reached 8.25 million pieces; cotton cloth, planned to reach 72.9 to 80.6 billion meters, actually reached 75 billion meters; salt, planned to reach 10 to 11 million tons, actually reached 11.04 million tons; machine-made paper, planned to reach 150 to 160 million tons, actually reached 170 million tons; grain, planned to reach about 50 billion jin, actually reached 54.01 billion jin; cotton, planned to reach about 480 million dan, actually reached 482 million dan; soybeans, planned to reach about 25 billion jin, actually reached 23 billion jin. The 1959 output of nine types of products did not reach the 1962 targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan, namely: crude oil, aluminum ingots, chemical fertilizers, edible vegetable oils, sugar, pigs, cattle, horses, and sheep. However, except for sugar and livestock, their average annual growth rate exceeded the planned requirements.

We completed the main targets of the originally planned Second Five-Year Plan in two years, gaining three years of time. This allows us to significantly raise the level of economic development during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Currently, the State Planning Commission is working with various departments and regions to draft the supplementary plan for the remaining three years of the Second Five-Year Plan based on the actual experience of the past two years of the Great Leap Forward.

The two years of continuous Great Leap Forward have proven that the general line for socialist construction, as outlined by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, to build socialism with great enthusiasm, strive to advance, and achieve more, better, faster, and more economical results, is a great creation. It reflects the strong desire of the 650 million people of our country to quickly change the situation of "poverty and backwardness" and build our country into a powerful socialist state. It also accurately reflects the superiority of the socialist economy and the necessity of rapid development. This general line mobilizes all positive factors, making our socialist construction achieve the situation of the Great Leap Forward.

The general line for our socialist construction is rich in content. Its starting point is: the people are the creators of history and the most active factor in productive forces. The people, liberated from the old society and becoming masters in the socialist system, can fully unleash their enthusiasm and creativity, making production and construction develop at a high speed.

To continuously unleash the enthusiasm of the people, we follow the principle of combining the continuous revolution theory and the theory of stages of revolution as expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong, and we continuously and reasonably resolve the contradictions between the productive relations and productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, we continuously reform the productive relations and superstructure, thus opening up a broad path for the continuous development of productive forces. The continuous development of productive forces, in turn, forces the productive relations and superstructure to undergo continuous reform. After the decisive victory in the socialist revolution in the ownership of means of production in 1956, we followed up in 1957 with the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, crushing the savage attacks of the bourgeois rightists on socialism, carrying out a nationwide rectification campaign, launching a large-scale communist education campaign, and arousing the enthusiasm and creativity of the people nationwide to build socialism. We resolutely carried out a comprehensive socialist revolution in economic, political, and ideological aspects, resolutely and continuously eliminated the various influences left over from the old society, broke various kinds of superstitions, and liberated people in all aspects. This was an important reason for the unprecedented situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Due to the improvement of the political consciousness of the people and the development of the Great Leap Forward, the vast rural areas of our country achieved the collectivization of the people's communes. This larger-scale, higher-degree of collectivization, and the combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military, as well as the integration of political and communal affairs, is the best form of grassroots social organization for accelerating the socialist construction of our country. In the future, it will be the best organizational form for the transition from collective ownership to public ownership in rural areas and from a socialist society to a communist society. It further mobilizes and organizes the strength of more than 500 million peasant masses. In 1959, despite the fact that 30% of the sowing area suffered serious natural disasters, our agricultural production continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward, proving the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. Now, all cities are establishing people's communes, developing street industries, developing suburban agriculture, developing public welfare undertakings, and establishing public canteens, extensively organizing the economic life of residents, further organizing the urban population, and liberating tens of thousands of urban housewives from household labor to participate in social labor. All of this not only promotes the development of production and construction but also promotes the thorough transformation of urban social life.

In 1958 and 1959, we carried out a series of reforms in state-owned enterprises, government agencies, management systems, regulations, labor relations, and leadership methods. Except for a few large-scale enterprises with national significance, we transferred the enterprises originally managed by the central departments to the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions for management; many enterprises originally managed by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions were also transferred to the prefectures or counties for management, implementing a system that combines unified leadership with graded management. In terms of the use of funds and materials, we expanded the management authority of enterprises. In the vast number of enterprises, we implemented the democratic centralism, established the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the party committee and the workers' congress, reformed unreasonable regulations, implemented the system of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management, and adopted the method of combining cadres, workers, and technical personnel in production activities. In government agencies, we also implemented the system of cadres participating in physical labor and being sent down for tempering, while requiring all leading cadres to appear in the guise of ordinary workers and treat people equally. In terms of wage and welfare systems, we implemented the principle of combining political and ideological education with material incentives, with political and ideological education as the main focus, the principle of combining the increase of collective welfare with the increase of individual income while gradually increasing the proportion of collective welfare, and the principle of mainly using time-based wages with piece-based wages and bonus wages as supplements. All of these have further improved the relationships between the central government and local governments, leaders and the led, and people in labor and other social activities. In this way, the upper and lower levels become one, forming a completely equal brotherly relationship, further stimulating the enthusiasm and consciousness of the broad masses of workers to build socialism. We must completely eliminate the feudal lord-style, bureaucratic, and commandist styles of leadership. To achieve this goal, it is not something that can be accomplished in a short period of time and requires a long-term process, requiring a rectification campaign every year to thoroughly criticize those with feudal lord-style and bureaucratic, commandist tendencies, and change their shortcomings.

In socialist construction, we have implemented a set of "two-legged" policies, that is, under the condition of prioritizing heavy industry, we simultaneously develop industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry; under the condition of centralized leadership, comprehensive planning, and division of labor and cooperation, we simultaneously develop central industry and local industry, large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, modern and traditional production methods. This set of policies not only mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad urban population but also mobilizes the enthusiasm of more than 500 million peasants to develop both agriculture and industry; not only mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers but also mobilizes the enthusiasm of the families of the broad masses of workers; not only mobilizes the enthusiasm of the central departments to develop industry and other enterprises and undertakings but also mobilizes the enthusiasm of various levels of local governments and people's communes to develop industry and other enterprises and undertakings; not only mobilizes the enthusiasm of people with higher technical levels but also mobilizes the enthusiasm of people with lower technical levels or even no technical skills. In other words, this set of policies can fully and comprehensively mobilize the enthusiasm of the people of our country, coordinate and plan efforts from all aspects in an organized manner, and concentrate on the cause of socialist construction.

Implementing this set of "simultaneous development" policies makes it possible to develop the socialist planned economy at a high speed and in a balanced manner. The proportion of industry and agriculture is the most basic proportion in the national economy. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and industry is the leading factor. Under the condition of prioritizing heavy industry, implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, we can not only ensure the priority growth of means of production but also ensure the rapid growth of consumer goods, thus ensuring the rapid expansion of the scale of national construction and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the people. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, our industrial production increased by 131.5%, and agricultural production increased by 45.8%; in industry, heavy industry increased by 190.9%, and light industry increased by 79.1%. This shows that while heavy industry achieved a Great Leap Forward, agriculture and light industry also achieved a Great Leap Forward, and the proportion between them has become more coordinated, and the proportion between means of production and consumer goods has also become more coordinated.

Due to the implementation of this set of "simultaneous development" policies in industry, the distribution of our industry has become more reasonable, the utilization of resources has been expanded, and some weak links in production have caught up. In just two years, we have established more than 1,300 small-scale modern iron smelting enterprises, of which about 200 can be developed into medium or small-scale iron and steel integrated enterprises. Now the layout of the iron and steel industry is very different from before, except for Tibet, every province, municipality, and autonomous region has iron and steel enterprises of different scales. The development of the iron and steel industry has driven the development of other industries. Various regions have established various industries according to their own resource conditions. In this way, industry can gradually be closely integrated with agriculture, industrial enterprises can be close to the sources of raw materials and consumption areas, and our industry can form a situation of being scattered and blooming everywhere. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, large-scale modern production enterprises played a leading role, and medium and small-scale modern, traditional, or combined production enterprises also played a significant role. In the 20.5 million tons of pig iron produced in 1959 (excluding pig iron), 11.05 million tons were produced by medium and small-scale enterprises, accounting for more than half; in the 13.35 million tons of steel produced in 1959 (excluding pig iron), 4.72 million tons were produced by medium and small-scale converters, accounting for more than one-third. It should be noted that the small-scale traditional enterprises established in 1958, especially the iron smelting, steel smelting, and coal mining enterprises, after rectification and improvement, the majority have expanded their production scale and improved their technical level, becoming modern or combined production enterprises. They will play an increasingly important role in production.

In all economic work, we have continuously strengthened the leadership of the Party, implemented political leadership, launched large-scale mass movements, and made socialist undertakings develop vigorously and vigorously. The victory of all undertakings depends on the masses, and the conduct of all work must follow the mass line. This is our unshakable principle. Since 1958, we have launched one movement after another on various economic fronts, breaking down the old institutions that hinder production development and establishing new institutions that are conducive to production development. In the movement, we tempered a large number of cadres and also tempered an even larger number of people; we developed the spirit of hard work and practical work among the people, and also developed the wisdom of clever work. The socialist competition to learn from, catch up with, and help the advanced, and the large-scale cooperation, has been launched in various places and various enterprises, forming a hot trend. This trend has improved labor productivity, improved product quality, reduced production costs, and effectively carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, making the national economy develop more, faster, better, and more economically.

All our economic work is led by politics, and our mass movements are carried out under the centralized leadership of the Party. The Party and the government call on the people to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and develop the spirit of daring to think and do. The Party and the government implement the principle of distribution according to work in the distribution of personal consumer goods, while educating the people to strive for distant goals and not to quarrel over personal remuneration. In government agencies, organizations, schools, enterprises, and public welfare undertakings, and in people's communes, we use the forms of big debates, big posters, and big discussions to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and let the people educate themselves. In this way, we ensure that every laborer can always maintain full enthusiasm and energy, can overcome difficulties tenaciously, and can dare to innovate.

In 1959, a small number of rightist opportunists within the Party opposed the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement. They formed factional organizations and carried out activities to split the Party, launching a savage attack on the Party's majority from within the Party. This is a reflection within the Party of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in society and the struggle between socialism and capitalism. The socialist revolution in various aspects of our country has achieved great victories, but there are still a small number of people in society who are dissatisfied with and oppose the socialist system and attempt to restore the capitalist system. These rightist opportunists within the Party are the spokesmen of the anti-socialist elements in society. They oppose the Party's general line for socialist construction, oppose the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, and in essence want to restore the capitalist system. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held in Lushan in August 1959, thoroughly smashed the savage attacks of the rightist opportunists within the Party. Subsequently, a nationwide mass movement to oppose the rightist tendency, boost morale, and increase production and economize was launched, achieving the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1959.

The great practice of 1958 and 1959 has given us rich experience. This experience tells us: under the socialist system, it is completely possible to develop the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, and it is an objective necessity. The national economy always goes through a process of development from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance again, and each cycle raises the level of production. In the past two years, as we gradually recognized and grasped this law from practice, we not only focused on the key production sectors to make them leap forward first but also continuously made the backward sectors catch up with the advanced sectors, thus achieving a Great Leap Forward in all sectors of the national economy. This comprehensive Great Leap Forward not only ensures the coordination of the basic proportions of the national economy but also ensures that the phenomenon of imbalance in some local proportions is quickly overcome. It is precisely because of this that the Great Leap Forward of our national economy will continue to develop and will leap forward better and better.

The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are the three magic weapons of the entire socialist construction period of our country, and they are the products of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong, in the process of socialist construction, just as in the process of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, creatively applied the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and formulated the Party's general line and a set of related policies, enriching the treasury of Marxism-Leninism. The general line and the related set of policies fully and comprehensively unleash the subjective initiative of the people, continuously reform the productive relations and superstructure to meet the requirements of the development of productive forces, and make the high-speed development of the Great Leap Forward of the national economy and the planned and proportional development be unified. In this way, the cause of socialist construction of our country has developed rapidly and vigorously along the correct track. The banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater victories in the future.

II

1960 is a very important year for the development of the cause of socialist construction in our country. The people of the whole country strive to achieve a continuous Great Leap Forward in the national economy this year, which will lay the foundation for the continuous Great Leap Forward during the Second Five-Year Plan period and even the entire 1960s.

The task of developing the national economy in 1960 is, in general, to better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, strive for a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the national economy. To achieve this task, the arrangement of the 1960 national economic plan should further determine that agriculture is the foundation and industry is the leading factor, making the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture complementary; it should continue to implement the policy of industry led by steel, agriculture led by grain, and comprehensive arrangements, and further strengthen the transportation, power, and mining industries; to better handle the relationships between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, and within each sector, to make the Great Leap Forward of the national economy better.

Agriculture plays an extremely important role in the development of the national economy, as it is the foundation of the national economy. If agriculture develops faster, it can not only ensure the faster development of light industry but also ensure the priority development of heavy industry. Accelerating the development of agriculture and seriously implementing the "Forty Articles on the Development of Agriculture" is the key link to achieving the high-speed and proportional development of our socialist planned economy. Further determining the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is completely in line with the objective requirements of the development of the socialist economy. Implementing this policy will certainly be conducive to the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy.

To accelerate the development of agriculture, in 1960, while further giving full play to the advantages of the people's communes, we should actively promote the technological transformation of agriculture and improve the labor productivity of agriculture. The realization of the collectivization of the people in our country, on the one hand, has put forward an urgent demand for the technological transformation of agriculture, and on the other hand, has created favorable conditions for the technological transformation of agriculture. Our industry, after the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, has also achieved two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, creating the necessary material and technological foundation for the technological transformation of agriculture. During the period of cooperation, we criticized the view that mechanization is not possible without mechanization, which was completely necessary. At that time, if we had waited for mechanization and delayed the collectivization of agriculture, we would not have been able to guarantee the increase in agricultural production, nor would we have been able to guarantee the development of industry, nor would we have been able to guarantee the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Now, when the various conditions for the technological transformation of agriculture are in place, if we do not actively promote the technological transformation of agriculture, making the development of agriculture able to meet the needs of the rapid development of industry and the growing needs of the entire national economy and the people's lives, we will make a mistake. In the past ten years, our worker-peasant alliance has gone through two stages, namely, the land reform stage and the cooperation stage. Under the condition that the collectivization of the people has been realized in the countryside, we should promote the worker-peasant alliance to a new stage, making industry actively support agriculture and gradually establishing agriculture on a modern basis.

Based on the current situation in our country, the technological transformation of agriculture must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. In terms of agricultural mechanization, our goal is to strive for a small solution in four years, a solution in seven years, and a big solution in ten years. Within ten years or so, we strive to basically realize the mechanization and water conservation of agriculture nationwide and achieve a certain degree of electrification. Our policy is to promote mechanization and semi-mechanization simultaneously, modern and traditional methods simultaneously, and in the next three years, we should mainly focus on improving agricultural tools and semi-mechanized tools. This requires state-owned industry to strive to increase the production of agricultural machinery and other production materials needed for agriculture, while requiring the peasant masses nationwide to carry out a technological innovation movement to improve agricultural tools and equipment. Adopting such a policy, we can mobilize all positive factors and accelerate the process of technological transformation of agriculture in our country. In the technological transformation of agriculture, we should follow the principle of adapting to local conditions, while closely combining with the various measures of the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture and the excellent tradition of fine farming in our country, making new technologies play the maximum role in agricultural production.

To promote the rapid development of agriculture, various sectors such as industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, and health should all take supporting agriculture as an important task and arrange their work according to this task.

The agricultural production in 1960 should continue to focus on grain, and on the basis of ensuring the increase in grain production, comprehensively arrange the production of various crops such as cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine, and miscellaneous crops, and implement the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, striving for the comprehensive and rapid development of agriculture. In the development of animal husbandry, we should prioritize pig farming, launch a large-scale mass movement of pig farming, and initiate a new upsurge in the comprehensive development of animal husbandry; making agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry mutually promote and develop together. To ensure the increase in agricultural production, in addition to actively carrying out the technological transformation of agriculture, various localities should also continue to carry out the water conservancy construction movement of large, medium, and small projects in combination, increase and improve the irrigation area, and enhance the ability to prevent droughts, floods, and waterlogging.

On the basis of striving for the comprehensive and rapid development of agriculture, in 1960, we should strive to expand the sources of raw materials for light industry from various aspects, strengthen the comprehensive utilization of resources, and accelerate the development of light industry to ensure a greater supply of various light industrial products.

In 1960, while prioritizing the development of heavy industry, we should strive to strengthen support for agriculture. This is an honorable task for the industrial front. Strengthening the support of industry for agriculture will accelerate the development of agriculture and also accelerate the development of industry itself. Each of our heavy industry departments should establish the idea of serving agriculture and regard supporting the technological transformation of agriculture as their own responsibility. Large-scale modern industrial enterprises managed by the central government should strive to increase the production of production materials suitable for agriculture; local industries at various levels and commune-run industries should fully utilize their strengths, adopt the method of combining modern and traditional technologies, and promote the technological transformation of agriculture from various aspects.

The development of heavy industry should continue to implement the policy of steel as the leading factor and comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In the past two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, each heavy industry department has developed significantly, and the relationships between them have become more coordinated, and some originally weak sectors are quickly catching up. However, there are still some weak sectors that need to be further strengthened. In the heavy industry construction in 1960, we should continue to focus on the construction of the iron and steel industry, while striving to strengthen the construction of the power industry, mining industry, non-ferrous metal industry, petroleum industry, and synthetic rubber industry, making them better adapt to the needs of the continuous Great Leap Forward of the entire industry and the entire national economy. Each heavy industry department in 1960 should strengthen the work of comprehensive resource utilization.

Greatly developing the transportation industry to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development is an important task for developing the national economy in 1960. While giving full play to the potential of existing transportation equipment, we should strive to strengthen the basic construction of transportation, continue to focus on railways, increase locomotives and vehicles, build new railway trunk lines and branch lines, and strengthen the construction of highways and ports, strive to achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and transportation, and develop and transform civilian transportation tools.

In 1960, large-scale basic construction will continue. In the arrangement of the construction plan, we must better reflect several "simultaneous development" policies. While paying attention to the proportion of industrial investment, we should appropriately increase the proportion of investment in water conservancy, agriculture, and forestry, and increase the proportion of investment in the transportation industry. Various constructions, in addition to continuing to pay attention to the construction of necessary large-scale projects, should especially pay attention to increasing the construction of medium and small-scale projects. Each industrial department and transportation department, each locality, and people's commune should continue to actively develop a batch of "small modern group" enterprises and "small traditional group" enterprises in 1960, while improving the production level of the original "small modern group" enterprises and "small traditional group" enterprises. In places with coal and iron, we should actively establish a batch of new coal mining, coking, iron smelting, and steel smelting "small modern group" enterprises or "small traditional group" enterprises, to drive the development of other "small modern group" or "small traditional group" enterprises in various industries, and adapt to the needs of production and construction development, according to the possible conditions of each place, build the necessary number of small modern railways or small traditional railways. To give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of local governments and enterprises, in the arrangement of investment, we should give local governments the necessary flexibility, and promote the method of basic construction investment contracting. In the arrangement of projects, we should pay attention to blooming everywhere, reasonable layout, and better implement the policy of combining the rational use of old industrial bases and the active construction of new industrial bases. In 1960, we should appropriately increase the construction of school buildings, staff dormitories, and urban public utilities.

In 1960, regardless of the department, we must further carry out the movement of increasing production and economizing, with technological innovation and technological revolution as the center, actively develop the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation mass movements, encourage and support the initiative of the working people and scientific and technical personnel to innovate and invent, continue to promote effective advanced experiences, strive to save raw materials, improve labor productivity, improve product quality, increase new varieties, reduce costs, and reform enterprise management and labor organization.

Based on the above tasks, policies, and possible conditions, the main indicators of the 1960 draft plan are as follows: the total industrial and agricultural output value is 298 billion yuan, an increase of 23% over 1959. Of this, the total industrial output value is 210 billion yuan, an increase of 29%; the total agricultural output value is 88 billion yuan, an increase of 12%. The total investment in basic construction within the state budget in 1960 is 32.5 billion yuan (excluding approximately 6 billion yuan of investment raised by local governments and enterprises), an increase of 21.7% over 1959. In the total investment, the industrial sector accounts for 58.3%, the agricultural, water conservancy, forestry, and meteorological sectors account for 12%, the transportation and postal sectors account for 20.9%, the scientific research and education and health sectors account for 3.5%, the commercial sector accounts for 1.3%, urban construction accounts for 2.8%, and others account for 1.2%. In the total investment, the investment allocated to enterprises directly under the central ministries is 16.35 billion yuan, accounting for 50.3%; the investment allocated to local enterprises is 16.15 billion yuan, accounting for 49.7%.

The 1960 national economic plan is a plan for continuous Great Leap Forward, and it is a plan that can be completed and overfulfilled with effort. Successfully implementing this plan, we can strive to achieve in less than ten years what was originally planned to be achieved in ten years in terms of the output of major industrial products, surpassing Britain, and achieving the "Forty Articles on the Development of Agriculture" ahead of schedule.

III

Now, I will explain the arrangement of the 1960 plan indicators in nine aspects: heavy industry, heavy industry supporting agriculture, agriculture, light industry, rural people's commune industry, urban people's commune industry and urban street industry, transportation, commerce, labor wages, and scientific research and education and health undertakings.

(1) Heavy Industry

The total industrial output value of heavy industry in 1960 is planned to be 127 billion yuan, an increase of 32% over 1959.

To further expand the foundation of heavy industry and more powerfully support the construction of agriculture, transportation, and light industry, this year we will continue to develop the production of raw material industries such as steel, non-ferrous metals, acids, alkalis, cement, timber, and synthetic rubber. The plan is to produce 27.5 million tons of pig iron (excluding traditional pig iron), an increase of 34% over the previous year; 18.4 million tons of steel (excluding traditional steel), an increase of 38%; 1.5 million tons of sulfuric acid, an increase of 42%; 16 million tons of cement, an increase of 30%; 47 million cubic meters of timber, an increase of 14%. At the same time, we will develop more electricity, coal, and petroleum, which are fuel and power industries. The plan is to generate 55.5 to 58 billion kWh of electricity, an increase of 34% to 40%; 4.25 billion tons of coal, an increase of 22%; 5.2 million tons of crude oil, an increase of 41%. In the machinery manufacturing sector, the plan is to produce 3.3 million kW of power generation equipment, an increase of 53%; 90,000 units of metal cutting machine tools, an increase of 29%; and to increase the growth rate of agricultural machinery as much as possible, with tractors to be increased by more than two times, and machine-drawn agricultural tools and power threshers to be increased by about 1.5 times. We will greatly increase the growth rate of transportation equipment, with railway locomotives, freight cars, and heavy-duty trucks all to be increased by more than 50%, and barges to be increased by 37%. The production of equipment needed for light industry will also be arranged according to actual needs.

In 1960, each department of heavy industry should strive to tap potential in the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, increase varieties, and improve quality, striving to achieve a leap forward in quantity, variety, and quality. The steel industry should strive to improve the utilization rate of blast furnaces and converters, reduce the consumption of ore, pig iron, and coal, increase the proportion of high-quality steel and alloy steel, and increase the production of steel rails, steel plates, steel pipes, and high-quality steel materials and new varieties. The coal industry should increase the production of coking coal and washed coal and reduce the ash content of coal. The machinery industry should increase the production of large and precision products, and so on.

The arrangement of basic construction in each department of heavy industry in 1960 is as follows:

Title: The National Economic Plan for 1960
Author:
Date: 1960-04-01
Page: 1

The iron and steel industry has a total of seventy-three construction projects above the designated scale, including continuation projects for major steel bases such as Anshan Steel, Wuhan Steel, and Baotou Steel, as well as large and medium-sized integrated steel enterprises distributed across provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. While planning the construction of a batch of new "small modern" steel enterprises in various places, efforts should be made to strengthen mining, coking, transportation, and other links to ensure they match the smelting capacity.

In the non-ferrous metals industry, in addition to ensuring the construction of necessary large non-ferrous metal projects, efforts should be made to construct local medium and small-sized non-ferrous metal enterprises and vigorously develop "small modern" and "small indigenous" non-ferrous metal enterprises.

The power industry has a total of one hundred ninety-two construction projects above the designated scale, including one hundred fifteen thermal power stations, forty-nine hydropower stations, and twenty-eight transmission and substation projects. The newly installed generating capacity for 1960 is planned to be 4.2 million kilowatts.

The coal industry has a total of eighty-one construction projects above the designated scale. The plan emphasizes the construction of new coal bases in the East China, Southwest, Northwest, and Central South regions, and pays attention to the development of small coal mines to gradually achieve the rational distribution of coal production and reduce the amount of coal transported from north to south.

The petroleum industry has a total of seventeen construction projects above the designated scale. The focus of construction is: continuing the construction and exploration of oil fields in various regions, and continuing to strengthen the construction of synthetic oil. To quickly increase the production of crude oil, 1960 will actively construct medium and small-sized synthetic oil plants. Localities and people's communes should also, based on the availability of resources and other conditions, establish simple coal-oil refineries using local methods.

The machinery industry has a total of two hundred three construction projects above the designated scale. Among them, there are fifty-five agricultural machinery construction projects, mainly including the second phase of the Luoyang Tractor Factory, the Tianjin Tractor Factory, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, etc. Forty-eight percent of the investment in agricultural machinery is allocated to projects below the designated scale, and these construction projects are all arranged by local authorities to ensure that the products meet the specific needs of the local area. In the arrangement, attention has also been paid to the construction of matching projects and repair plants. In addition to strengthening agricultural machinery, the focus of the machinery industry's construction is to increase casting and forging capacity, increase the production capacity of large and precision machinery, and increase the production capacity of general machinery, electrical equipment, and instrumentation and other supporting equipment.

The chemical industry has a total of sixty-seven construction projects above the designated scale. The focus of construction is chemical fertilizers, acids, alkalis, and synthetic rubber. The chemical fertilizer industry will continue to build seventeen large enterprises and build more than one hundred forty medium and small-sized enterprises nationwide. Efforts will be made to develop synthetic rubber.

The building materials industry and the forestry industry have a total of one hundred twenty-nine construction projects above the designated scale. The building materials industry will strengthen the construction of the cement, glass, and ceramic industries and actively carry out the construction of non-metallic mines. The forestry industry, in addition to continuing the development of the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas, will develop new forest areas in Sichuan, Fujian, and other places. At the same time, increase the production capacity of sawn timber and actively develop the comprehensive utilization of wood, mainly artificial boards.

To achieve the basic construction plan of heavy industry quickly, efficiently, and economically, each department should first focus on continuing projects to ensure they are completed and put into production as soon as possible. Each department should strengthen the leadership of design work, improve the political and technical level of designers, encourage designers to further liberate their minds, and make various designs absorb advanced experience to better meet the requirements of being quick, efficient, and economical. All basic construction units should actively adopt rapid construction methods.

(II) Heavy Industry Supporting Agriculture

In the comprehensive support of agriculture by various departments, heavy industry has a particularly important task.

To accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, the draft plan stipulates that in 1960, the state will allocate 1.1 million tons of steel for the production of agricultural machinery and tools, an increase of about 100% compared to 1959. Domestic-produced products directly provided to agriculture include 22,000 tractors, 2,000 combine harvesters, 2.5 million horsepower of irrigation machinery, 8,500 heavy-duty trucks, 2.8 million tons of chemical fertilizers, 1.8 million tons of pesticides, 10 million wheeled handcarts, and 200,000 to 300,000 kilowatts of small hydropower equipment. In addition, semi-mechanized tools and small tools will also increase significantly.

In 1960, the agricultural sector will increase mechanical power by more than 5 million horsepower. In this year, the area of mechanized farming will reach more than 1 billion mu, an increase of about 40% compared to 1959; the area of mechanized irrigation will reach more than 2 billion mu, an increase of 100% compared to 1959.

With the acceleration of agricultural technological transformation, it is necessary to promptly address a series of issues such as the establishment of agricultural machinery repair stations, the training of technical personnel, and the trial and research of new agricultural machinery. Currently, various places are making specific plans and taking steps to address these issues.

In addition to increasing the production of agricultural production materials, industrial enterprises should also organize service teams to teach technology, help communes train technical personnel, help communes establish factories, and provide comprehensive support to agriculture. To do a good job in these support tasks, it is necessary to promote the methods of "direct connection" between factories and communes, "experimental fields," and "piecewise contracting."

(III) Agriculture

The plan proposes that in 1960, the total agricultural output value will increase by 12%, the output of grain and cotton will each increase by about 10%, and the number of pigs raised will increase by about 35%.

In arranging agricultural production, each locality should, in accordance with the requirements of "grain as the key and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries," pay attention to the following: 1. First, ensure the increase in grain production and grasp the appropriate proportion of staple grains, coarse grains, and feed. 2. While ensuring the increase in grain production, economic crops should be developed relatively quickly. The five major economic crops of cotton, oilseeds, hemp, tobacco, and sugar should have a relatively large increase, and the production of vegetables should continue to be emphasized. Tea, silkworm cocoons, medicinal materials, fruits, and other agricultural products should also be actively developed. 3. Great efforts should be made to develop animal husbandry centered on pig raising, and the problems of feed and fodder for livestock should be seriously addressed. The responsibility system and reward methods for the breeding, raising, and use of livestock should be established and improved, and the work of preventing and treating livestock diseases should be strengthened. 4. Actively organize labor and make full use of agricultural slack seasons to develop various sideline productions and local specialties. 5. Increase the commercial rate of agricultural products, strengthen the construction of agricultural product commercial bases, and strive to achieve agricultural technological transformation in these places first. 6. Give full play to the advantages of state farms and provide the state with more agricultural and livestock products.

Putting animal husbandry on an equal footing with crop cultivation, and within animal husbandry, prioritizing pig raising, is an important step in promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture. One pig is a small organic fertilizer factory. By focusing on pig raising, the key to increasing fertilizer in a quick, efficient, and economical way can be grasped. With the large-scale increase in pigs, animal husbandry will also develop on a large scale, solving the problem of meat supply and expanding the source of raw materials for light industry. While carrying out the large-scale pig-raising campaign in 1960, efforts should be made to develop cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits, and attention should be paid to the development of beekeeping.

To ensure the successful implementation of the 1960 agricultural production plan, it is necessary to further give full play to the advantages of the people's commune, continue to consolidate and develop the people's commune. While focusing on agricultural technological transformation, it is necessary to continue to implement the "eight-character constitution" of soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and labor. The continuous development of the people's commune, the better use of the "eight-character constitution," and the gradual implementation of agricultural technological transformation, these three combined, will enable China's agricultural production to develop steadily and rapidly.

While focusing on agricultural production and construction, each locality and rural people's commune should properly arrange the lives of rural people and do a good job in running public canteens.

The planned investment in basic construction for agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, and meteorology in 1960 is 3.91 billion yuan, an increase of 62.9% compared to 1959. It is required that in 1960, the irrigation area will be improved by 2 billion mu, the irrigation area will be expanded by 600 million mu, the waterlogging area will be increased by 600 million mu, the afforestation area will be 2 billion mu, and the area initially implementing water and soil conservation measures will increase by 100,000 to 150,000 square kilometers. To achieve these requirements, the water conservancy construction in 1960 will, in accordance with the policy of "storage, small, and group" and the combination of large, medium, and small projects, in addition to the construction of large reservoirs, also construct a large number of medium and small flood control, irrigation, and comprehensive water use projects. Large water conservancy projects such as Sanmenxia in Henan, Danjiangkou in Hubei, and Yuezheng in Hebei will all undergo large-scale construction. In agricultural basic construction, the reclamation area of state farms will be expanded, and the construction of rubber plantations will be strengthened.

(IV) Light Industry

The total output value of light industry in 1960 is planned to be 83 billion yuan, an increase of 24% compared to 1959.

Based on the availability of raw materials, the indicators for various major light industrial products are as follows:

* Cotton yarn: 9 million pieces, an increase of 9%.
* Cotton cloth: 7.6 billion meters, an increase of 1.3%.
* Knitted products: 1.5 million pieces of yarn used, an increase of 20%.
* Paper: 2.8 million tons, an increase of 31%.
* Sugar: 1.3 million tons, an increase of 15%.
* Edible vegetable oil: 1.7 million tons, an increase of 16%.
* Salt: 14 million tons, an increase of 27%.
* Aquatic products: 5.8 million tons, an increase of 16%.
* Cigarettes: 6 million cartons, an increase of 9%.

The key to increasing light industry production is to expand the source of raw materials, which requires the joint efforts of the agricultural, heavy industry, and commercial departments. In 1960, in the agricultural sector, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the sowing area of economic crops, ensure the allocation of more chemical fertilizers and pesticides for economic crops, and strive to increase more raw materials for light industry; it is also necessary to organize the masses to collect wild plants and collect all usable raw materials for light industry. In the heavy industry sector, it is necessary to increase the production of basic chemical products, strive to achieve the comprehensive utilization of coal and wood, and increase various raw materials needed for light industry; it is necessary to produce some small processing machinery to meet the needs of people's communes; the supply of raw materials, materials, fuel, and power should, as much as possible, consider the needs of light industry. In the commercial sector, it is necessary to strengthen the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and the recycling of waste and scrap.

In addition to improving product quality and increasing varieties, the light industry sector should do everything possible to save raw materials and materials, improve the output rate, especially the output rate of vegetable oil and sugar; strengthen the comprehensive utilization of agricultural raw materials, and promote the use of sugarcane bagasse for papermaking, cottonseed for spinning, rice husk for oil extraction, and multi-stalked high-yield sorghum stalks for sugar production.

The planned investment in basic construction for the textile, light industry, and fishery departments in 1960 is 1.47 billion yuan, of which 90% is for enterprises under local jurisdiction. There are a total of 227 construction projects above the designated scale, including 105 in textiles, 40 in papermaking, 23 in sugar making, 20 in salt making, and 10 in fisheries. The scale of the entire construction is: adding 2.4 million cotton spinning spindles, 1.1 million tons of papermaking capacity, and 940,000 tons of sugar-making capacity.

In the construction of light industry, it is necessary to consider the regions where light industry is relatively less developed but has the conditions for development; it is necessary to adapt to the scattered nature of agricultural raw materials and arrange more medium and small-sized projects to make processing plants as close to the raw material production areas as possible.

(V) Rural People's Commune Industry, Urban People's Commune Industry, and Urban Street Industry

The two-year leap forward has greatly developed the rural people's commune industry, urban people's commune industry, and urban street industry, becoming a new force on the industrial front. In 1959, the output value of rural people's commune industry was about 10 billion yuan, an increase of 70% compared to 1958; the output value of urban people's commune industry and urban street industry was about 2 billion yuan, an increase of about 400% compared to 1958. In 1960, it is required that the output value of rural people's commune industry increases by about 50% compared to 1959, and the output value of urban people's commune industry and street industry increases by about 100%. In 1960, efforts should be made to improve the technical level of existing urban and rural commune industries and street industry enterprises, expand the production scale, and actively develop a batch of new "small indigenous," "small modern," or modern-indigenous combined enterprises.

Urban and rural commune industries and street industries should, under the guidance of the state plan, continue to implement the policy of local conditions, local materials, self-reliance, and thrift in running enterprises. Rural people's commune industry should make full use of local raw materials and actively develop the production of small agricultural tools, improved agricultural tools, and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, as well as the processing of agricultural and sideline products and the production of building materials, to serve agricultural production, large-scale industry, the market, and the lives of commune members. Urban people's commune industry and street industry should make full use of the edge and waste materials of large factories and urban waste and scrap materials to produce daily necessities needed by the people; at the same time, they should actively undertake the processing of materials from large factories to serve large-scale industry.

State-owned enterprises managed by the central and local governments should actively support the reasonable development of urban and rural people's commune industries and street industries in terms of technical training, technical personnel training, and equipment supply.

To accelerate the development of urban and rural people's commune industries and street industries, each region should strengthen the leadership of urban and rural commune industries and street industries, plan comprehensively, coordinate arrangements, gradually incorporate them into local plans, and gradually incorporate them into the state plan.

(VI) Transportation

The planned cargo volume for various modern means of transportation in 1960 is 1.43 billion tons, an increase of 42% compared to 1959. Among them, the cargo volume of railways is 7.2 billion tons, an increase of 33%; the cargo volume of motor vehicles is 5.4 billion tons, an increase of 57%; the cargo volume of ships and barges is 1.7 billion tons, an increase of 38%. The cargo volume of civilian means of transportation will also increase significantly.

In the past two years, the transportation industry has achieved continuous leaps forward, but it still cannot keep up with the needs of industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation. To change this situation, it is necessary to explore potential in all aspects and links of transportation and accelerate the construction of transportation.

In terms of exploiting the potential of existing transportation equipment, it is necessary to further strengthen the organization of transportation work, further plan and organize the "one-stop" cooperation between railways, highways, waterways, and industrial and mining enterprises, improve loading and unloading work, speed up the turnover of vehicles and ships, and strengthen internal transportation within factories and mines. Efforts should be made to organize the participation of government agencies and enterprises in transportation. The full use of civilian means of transportation, the appropriate strengthening of the professional transportation teams of people's communes, the combination of agricultural production, and the utilization of agricultural slack seasons should continue to carry out the mass movement of short-distance transportation. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of communications work, improve the transmission efficiency of telecommunications, and improve the overall efficiency of communications work.

The planned investment in basic construction for the transportation and postal departments in 1960 is 6.81 billion yuan, an increase of 37.6% compared to 1959. Among them, the railway department is 5 billion yuan, the transportation department is 1.57 billion yuan, and the postal department is 2.4 billion yuan.

Railway construction. In the arrangement, the policy of simultaneously building lines and increasing vehicles is implemented, and the policy of simultaneously building new lines and strengthening old lines, building trunk lines and branch lines, and specialized lines, heavy rail and light rail, and modern and indigenous rail is implemented.

The plan is to build 2,068 kilometers of trunk railways, 2,053 kilometers of branch railways, 1,223 kilometers of double-track railways, 2,000 kilometers of specialized railways, and 1,045 kilometers of light railways. The total is 8,389 kilometers, an increase of 82% compared to 1959. In addition, 421 kilometers of railways will be rebuilt. Various localities will also, according to needs and possibilities, build a large number of rail railways. The planned continuation of the construction of trunk railways includes the Lanxin Line, the Inner Mongolia-Kunming Line, the Chengdu-Kunming Line, the Sichuan-Guizhou Line, the Yunnan-Guizhou Line, the Hunan-Guizhou Line, the Lanzhou-Qinghai Line, the Houma-Xi'an Line, etc.

The number of locomotives will increase by 800, freight cars by 32,000, and passenger cars by 1,000.

Highway construction. Newly build 6,500 kilometers of main highways and rebuild 19,000 kilometers of main highways. Increase 9,000 highway transport trucks and 20,000 trailers. To adapt to the development of agricultural production, local governments and people's communes will build simple highways.

Waterway construction. In conjunction with water conservancy construction, increase the main inland waterway navigation mileage by more than 8,000 kilometers. Carry out the construction of sixteen major ports including Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qinhuangdao, and Hankou, and increase loading and unloading equipment. Increase the total number of ships and barges by 2 million tons and increase the power machinery by 100,000 horsepower to transform wooden sailboats.

Civil aviation construction. Open 11,000 kilometers of domestic air routes and increase various new types of passenger planes. Increase about 100 agricultural aircraft to serve agriculture.

Postal and telecommunications construction. In 1960, continue to strengthen the construction of trunk lines, focusing on the reconstruction of long-distance telephone lines in eight provinces and cities including Shanxi and Shandong. A total of 13,000 kilometers of copper wire will be laid.

(VII) Commerce

The planned total retail sales of social commodities in 1960 is 72.5 billion yuan, an increase of 14% compared to 1959.

The total supply value of major sideline foods in 1960 will increase by more than 20%; the varieties and quantities of knitted products will increase; the total supply value of daily industrial products will increase by more than 40%.

The total supply value of production materials for agriculture in 1960 will reach 11 billion yuan, an increase of 35% compared to 1959.

Commercial work should further serve the needs of production and people's lives, actively organize the supply of production materials and daily consumer goods that meet the needs of rural areas, and properly arrange the supply of commodities in cities, and strongly support the organization of work in urban people's communes. It is necessary to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the procurement tasks of various commodities, especially the procurement tasks of agricultural products.

Considering that the increase in social purchasing power in 1960 is mainly in rural areas, local industrial enterprises and people's commune industries should pay attention to arranging more products that meet the needs of agricultural production and rural life when arranging production.

With the continuous leap forward of the national economy, foreign trade will also continue to grow in 1960. The work of foreign trade should better implement the policy of self-reliance as the mainstay, seeking foreign aid as a supplement, and actively supporting the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. Under this policy, based on the spirit of internationalism, further strengthen economic exchanges and cooperation with various socialist brother countries, promote mutual economic prosperity; based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and mutual exchange, develop economic and trade relations with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For Western capitalist countries, we are also willing to develop trade relations with them on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, but we must firmly oppose various discriminatory measures against our country in trade by some Western countries.

The planned investment in basic construction for various commercial departments in 1960 is 433 million yuan, an increase of 13.9% compared to 1959. The main focus is on the construction of warehouses, oil depots, and processing plants.

(VIII) Labor and Wages

In 1960, efforts must be made to improve labor productivity, strive to achieve increased production without increasing personnel in old factories, and, as far as possible, allocate personnel to support new factories; new factories should increase production workers according to actual needs, but should, as far as possible, reduce the proportion of auxiliary workers and non-direct production personnel.

The plan proposes that the labor productivity of the industrial sector will increase by about 25%, the labor productivity of the railway transportation sector will increase by about 20%, and the labor productivity of construction and installation will increase by about 20%.

Due to the significant improvement in labor productivity in many enterprises after the promotion of technical innovation and technological revolution, a portion of employees will be allocated to support the construction of new enterprises. Therefore, the 1960 plan proposes to increase employees by only 1.8 million. To meet the needs of the continuous leap forward of production and construction, it is necessary to strengthen the training and training of new workers.

The planned average wage increase for employees in 1960 is 6%, and the total wage increase is 2.6 billion yuan. The increased wages are mainly used for the promotion of employees and necessary rewards, and the wage standards remain basically unchanged. The planned increase in national expenditures for employees' labor insurance, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and other collective welfare undertakings in 1960 is about 10%. Due to the expansion of the employment scope and the increase in collective welfare, the actual living standards of employees' families will be significantly improved.

All enterprises must strengthen labor protection work and implement the policy of safe production.

(IX) Scientific Research and Cultural, Educational, and Health Undertakings

In the field of education, the planned enrollment for various types of schools in 1960 is: 280,000 for higher education, 600,000 for secondary specialized schools, 800,000 for senior high schools, 40 million for junior high schools, and 2.8 million for agricultural high schools and other vocational high schools. To meet the needs of the great development of agriculture, the plan proposes to enroll 24,000 students in higher agricultural schools and 800,000 students in secondary agricultural technical schools.

The planned enrollment for primary schools in 1960 is 21 million.

While developing full-time and part-time school education, in 1960, various localities, departments, enterprises, and people's communes should also vigorously develop adult education.

To achieve the above tasks, it is necessary to strengthen leadership and comprehensive planning under the condition of mobilizing the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to run schools. In the development of education, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to the policy of serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and combining popularization with improvement. Each province, municipality, autonomous region, prefecture, and county should actively develop secondary and higher schools that serve local production and construction under the guidance of the national plan.

In the field of scientific research, efforts should be made to increase the number of researchers, establish research institutions, and increase necessary equipment and instruments. It is necessary to further strengthen the combination of scientific research, education, and production, that is: in scientific research institutions, scientific research is the main focus, while training personnel and small-scale production are also carried out; in higher education and secondary specialized schools, training personnel is the main focus, while scientific research and small-scale production are also carried out; in production enterprises, production is the main focus, while scientific research and training personnel are also carried out. It is necessary to mobilize the strength of all sectors to strive to learn, study, and master the latest scientific and technological achievements in the world, summarize the rich experience of mass practice, and strive to achieve the twelve-year scientific and technological plan in a relatively short period of time.

In the field of culture, the policy of "comprehensive planning, active development, key construction, and quality improvement" should be implemented to ensure that cultural undertakings better serve and promote the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, serve the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and launch a high tide of building socialist culture. In the field of film, in 1960, 80 feature films will be produced, and about 4,000 film projection units (mainly rural film projection teams) will be developed; attention should be paid to strengthening the production and projection of scientific and educational films. In the field of publishing, it is necessary to especially ensure the publication and supply of Marxist-Leninist classics and the works of Mao Zedong, strengthen the publication of textbooks, literacy materials, and scientific and technological books. Continue to vigorously develop mass cultural activities, especially rural cultural activities. Strengthen the training of cadres and the reform and improvement of the cultural and artistic teams. Vigorously develop the cultural undertakings of ethnic minorities and border areas.

In the field of health, continue to vigorously carry out the mass health movement of eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eradicating major diseases, and promote the experience of the health movement in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, and Foshan City, Guangdong Province. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, make a big fuss, and make extensive propaganda so that everyone knows and takes action, and combine the health movement with the great leap forward in production and the cultural and technological revolution. It is necessary to strengthen rural medical and preventive work with county hospitals as the center and actively support agricultural production. In 1960, the plan is to develop 45,000 hospital beds and vigorously develop simple beds.

Continue to vigorously carry out mass sports activities in urban and rural areas, promote physical exercises, ball games, running, mountain climbing, swimming, shooting, martial arts, and various sports activities, and improve the level of sports on the basis of popularization.

The planned investment in basic construction for scientific research and cultural, educational, and health departments in 1960 is 1.127 billion yuan, an increase of 65.7% compared to 1959, of which the investment in the education sector will increase by nearly 100%.

To achieve the victory of the 1960 leap forward plan and accelerate the development of socialist construction, the vast number of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in China are, with the momentum of breaking bamboo, carrying out a magnificent technological innovation and technological revolution movement. In the movement, new people and new things emerge in endless succession, innovations and creations bloom everywhere, and the spirit of communism is more fully displayed. Due to the widespread and in-depth development of this movement, China's vast cities and rural areas have presented a situation similar to the great steel smelting in 1958.

Currently, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement on all fronts is centered on closely combining with production, gradually realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation. This is a great movement with broad mass participation. Now, in the industrial and transportation sectors, more than 80% of employees have participated in the movement and actively proposed and implemented technological innovation suggestions. In rural areas, in the commercial, financial, and scientific, educational, and health sectors, the masses have all participated in the struggle to reform tools and improve operating methods, combining hard work, diligent work, and clever work. In many places and enterprises, single-item technological innovation has developed into comprehensive technological innovation, and innovation in one enterprise or one industry has developed into "one-stop" cooperation between enterprises and industries. These characteristics indicate that the great march of the Chinese people to conquer backward technology has begun nationwide. Of course, this is just the beginning, but it is a very gratifying beginning.

The widespread technological innovation and technological revolution movement is the inevitable result of continuously carrying out economic, political, ideological, and cultural revolutions, and is the inevitable product of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune. Any unit that has seriously carried out this movement can quickly improve labor productivity, quickly, efficiently, and economically complete the state plan, and continuously improve the political awareness of the masses. In many units, the spirit of communist cooperation has been more fully displayed, individualism and parochialism have rapidly decreased; advanced elements have significantly increased, and backward and intermediate elements have significantly decreased. Learning from advanced elements, catching up with advanced elements, helping backward elements, and taking on difficulties have become new social customs and moral standards. This movement will accelerate the process of industrial modernization, agricultural modernization, and scientific and cultural modernization in China, further improve the speed of socialist construction, and further improve the communist consciousness and scientific and technological cultural level of the masses. We should further promote this movement, making it more widespread and in-depth, continuously consolidating, developing, and improving it, and making it advance along the correct, scientific, and mass path.

In the movement, our long-term direction is: to universally develop single-item technological innovation into comprehensive technological innovation, and make the innovation of each enterprise, each industry, and each department mutually coordinated and form a system. Within the scope of an enterprise, it is necessary to develop single-process and single-workshop technological innovation into comprehensive-process and comprehensive-enterprise technological innovation, and make the supply of raw materials, production, transportation, and other links interlinked. Within the scope of an industry and a department, it is necessary to "match" the technological innovation experience of similar enterprises to form a comprehensive experience and a systematic experience, making technological innovation serialized. Between related enterprises, industries, and departments, it is necessary to organize "one-stop" cooperation, with industrial departments and agricultural departments mutually supporting each other, production departments and transportation and circulation departments mutually supporting each other, enterprise departments and scientific research departments mutually supporting each other, making technological innovation and technological revolution a comprehensive, systematic, and mutually coordinated activity of the national economy. Currently, the mining industry, raw material industry, power industry, and transportation industry should, in particular, strengthen the leadership of the movement, create and promote advanced technology and advanced experience that can greatly increase production and save resources, to meet the needs of processing industry and the entire national economy.

The development of technological innovation and technological revolution will inevitably require certain aspects of the superstructure and production relations to be reformed to meet the needs of the development of productive forces. Therefore, each locality, department, and enterprise should, after achieving certain important results in technological innovation and technological revolution, promptly improve production organization and labor organization, reform those rules and regulations that are no longer applicable, and appropriately adjust the wage and reward system, etc. The leading organs and leading personnel should promptly strengthen their work to make each link of the superstructure and production relations adapt to the rapid development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement and promote the continuous development of the movement.

Each locality, department, enterprise, and people's commune should, for technological innovation and technological revolution, make both short-term arrangements and long-term plans. In each period, there should be a clear direction, and specific tasks should be determined in a realistic manner to closely combine the technological innovation and technological revolution movement with the requirements of increased production and savings, and concentrate efforts to break through key issues and solve key problems, making the movement develop from one high tide to another.

In the movement, many advanced production technologies and production experiences created by us should be widely promoted. The leading personnel of each locality, department, enterprise, unit, people's commune, and street enterprise should fully support, test, summarize, and apply the advanced production technologies and production experiences created by their own locality, department, and unit, as well as the reasonable initiatives of the masses; they should also study and promote the advanced production technologies and production experiences created by other localities, departments, and units. In the promotion, various methods can be adopted. Many places have adopted the form of on-site meetings, the technical performance competition created by Anshan Steel, and the production competition created by Heilongjiang Province, which are all good methods and can be widely adopted.

In the movement, it is necessary to adopt the policy of simultaneously promoting large, medium, and small enterprises and combining them with each other. The "small indigenous" and "small modern" enterprises established since the great leap forward and the technologically backward medium and small enterprises have made many new creations in technology. It can be predicted that through the creative activities of these enterprises, not only is it possible to improve their technological level in a short period of time, but it will also enable us to find a way to develop technology quickly, efficiently, and economically. The numerous vivid examples that have emerged in all parts of the country can prove this point. For example, in Hebei, Anhui, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, there are batches of small blast furnaces with capacities of three cubic meters, eight cubic meters, and thirteen cubic meters, and the iron output per cubic meter capacity per day has continuously reached more than two tons for a long time, and some have reached more than three tons. We should continue to mobilize the masses of workers in "small indigenous," "small modern" enterprises, and technologically backward medium and small enterprises to continuously push the movement to a new high. The technological innovation and technological revolution movement in modern large-scale enterprises has also been widely carried out and has made many outstanding creations. However, the development of the movement is unbalanced, and some enterprises have not been fully mobilized. We should criticize the wrong view that modern large-scale enterprises do not need or cannot carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses of workers in this type of enterprise, break away from superstitions, break through outdated rules, reform production equipment and tools, improve product design and production processes, and improve operating methods, making them play a greater role in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

In the movement, it is also necessary to adopt the policy of combining modern and indigenous methods. Currently, in agriculture, industry, and transportation, many advanced production units have adopted indigenous methods to achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. Even in the adoption of new technologies, many have been completed using indigenous methods. Practice has proven that, as in production, in technological reform, it is possible and necessary to combine modern and indigenous methods. Modern methods should be adopted where possible, indigenous methods should be adopted where possible, or semi-modern and semi-indigenous methods should be adopted. Adopting such methods can effectively implement the policy of self-reliance as the mainstay within the scope of an enterprise to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, materials, equipment, and technical strength.

The technological innovation and technological revolution movement should be combined with the current widespread movement of studying Marxist-Leninist theory and the works of Mao Zedong throughout the country, making the movement have correct ideological guidance. To make the movement continuously develop healthily, we should adhere to political leadership, firmly follow the mass line, continue to mobilize the masses, carry out political and ideological education for the broad masses, making them understand the situation of the high-speed development of China's socialist construction and the great significance of the movement, inspiring their sky-high enthusiasm and great aspirations, and continuing to break away from superstitions, liberate thoughts, use brains, and display the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, mutual assistance, and fearlessness of difficulties. From countless historical facts, it can be seen that experts and technical personnel can reform old technologies and create new technologies, and ordinary workers with production experience can even more reform old technologies and create new technologies. Leading personnel, workers, and technical personnel should closely unite, work together, and use every possible means to definitely create miracles in technology. We should respect the scientific and technological achievements of our predecessors, strive to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, and improve the level of scientific and technological culture. We should combine daring to think and daring to do with scientific analysis, and not be constrained by existing achievements. Any new technology often succeeds after multiple trials, and we should not be afraid of difficulties and failures, and should not be deterred by temporary difficulties and failures. We have achieved the speed of the great leap forward in socialist construction, and we should also strive to achieve the speed of the great leap forward in technological improvement. The great leap forward in production cannot but lead to a profound technological revolution, and the technological revolution will definitely lead production to a new and higher level.

Comrades, the first quarter of 1960 is about to pass. In this period, all our undertakings have achieved continued leap forward victories. The total industrial output value for the first quarter is estimated to have increased by 80% compared to the same period last year. The situation on the agricultural front is also good, and significant achievements have been made in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. The basic construction work volume is estimated to be able to complete 20% of the annual plan. This victorious situation has made the enthusiasm of the broad masses continue to soar, and the spirit of creation continues to flourish. Of course, in the victorious advance, there will not be no difficulties. Currently, some provinces are experiencing spring drought, and transportation in some areas is relatively tense, which requires us to make efforts to overcome. Imperialist elements and enemy spies often use conspiratorial means to try to sabotage our socialist construction, which also requires us to be vigilant at all times. We believe that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the great banner of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, relying on the joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and all democratic parties, and continuing to strengthen economic cooperation with the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties, overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, and continue the great leap forward more quickly, efficiently, and economically!

    关于一九六○年国民经济计划草案的报告
    一九六○年三月三十日在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任　李富春各位代表：
    我代表国务院向大会提出关于一九六○年国民经济计划草案的报告，请予审议。
    一
    一九五九年，我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，坚持了社会主义建设的总路线，坚持了大跃进的发展速度，坚持了人民公社，开展了反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约的群众运动，超额完成了一九五九年八月全国人民代表大会常务委员会通过的一九五九年计划的调整指标。这样，我们就在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，在一九五九年继续实现了国民经济的大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这是我国人民的伟大胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    根据国家统计局的统计，一九五九年，我国工农业总产值达到了二千四百一十三亿元，比一九五八年的一千八百四十一亿元增长百分之三十一点一，其中：工业总产值达到了一千六百三十亿元，比一九五八年的一千一百七十亿元增长百分之三十九点三；农业总产值达到了七百八十三亿元，比一九五八年的六百七十一亿元增长百分之十六点七。国家预算内的基本建设投资总额完成了二百六十七亿元（地方和企业自筹的投资约五十亿元不在此数之内），比一九五八年的二百一十四亿元增长百分之二十四点五。施工的限额（注）以上的基本建设项目共有一千三百四十一个，其中全部建成和部分建成而投入生产的有六百七十一个；县一级以上兴办的限额以下的基本建设项目共有七万五千个，其中建设完工的有五万四千个。各种运输工具的货物运输总量达到了二十二亿一千二百万吨，比一九五八年的十三亿二千四百万吨增长百分之六十七；其中铁路货物运输量达到了五亿四千二百万吨，比一九五八年的三亿八千一百万吨增长百分之四十二。社会商品零售总额达到了六百三十八亿元，比一九五八年的五百四十八亿元增长百分之十六点四。这一年的国民收入比一九五八年增长了百分之二十一点六。这些数字表明，所有的经济部门在一九五九年都继续取得了大跃进的发展速度。在经济事业大发展的同时，科学、教育、文化、体育、卫生事业也都得到了大发展。
    （注）国家为了便于分级分类管理基本建设单位，规定出各类基本建设单位的投资限额。例如：钢铁联合企业的投资限额为两千万元；汽车制造工业、拖拉机制造工业、采煤工业的投资限额为一千万元；纺织工业、造纸工业、食盐工业、制糖工业的投资限额为五百万元；水库的投资限额为两千万元；等等。一个建设单位的全部投资等于或大于限额的，就是限额以上的建设单位；小于限额的，就是限额以下的建设单位。
    在一九五九年，我们伟大盟邦苏联和其他兄弟国家继续给了我国以巨大的援助。这种援助对我国国民经济的继续大跃进起了重大作用。
    由于一九五八年和一九五九年两年国民经济的连续大跃进，我们就提前三年完成了发展国民经济第二个五年计划（一九五八年至一九六二年）的主要指标。我国第二个五年计划的控制数字，是一九五六年九月由中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第一次会议提出、在一九五七年二月经过国务院全体会议通过的。第二个五年计划控制数字规定，工农业总产值一九六二年比一九五七年要增长百分之七十五左右，而一九五九年比一九五七年已经增长了百分之九十四点四；工业总产值要增长一倍左右，而一九五九年已经增长了百分之一百三十一点五；农业总产值要增长百分之三十五左右，而一九五九年已经增长了百分之四十五点八；国民收入要增长百分之五十左右，而一九五九年已经增长了百分之六十二点八六。
    就主要工农业产品来说，其中的多数，一九五九年的产量已经达到或者超过了第二个五年计划规定的一九六二年的指标。第二个五年计划控制数字规定的工农业产品共有二十四种，而在一九五九年达到或者超过原定指标的已经有十三种，接近原定指标的还有两种。这十五种产品，计划要求的一九六二年的产量同一九五九年的实际产量比较如下：钢（不包括土钢），计划达到一千零五十万吨至一千二百万吨，实际达到一千三百三十五万吨；原煤，计划达到一亿九千万吨至二亿一千万吨，实际达到三亿四千七百八十万吨；发电量，计划达到四百亿度至四百三十亿度，实际达到四百一十五亿度；冶金设备，计划达到三万吨至四万吨，实际达到二十万五千吨；发电设备，计划达到一百四十万瓩至一百五十万瓩，实际达到二百一十五万瓩；金属切削机床，计划达到六万台至六万五千台，实际达到七万台；原木，计划达到三千一百万立方米至三千四百万立方米，实际达到四千一百二十万立方米；水泥，计划达到一千二百五十万吨至一千四百五十万吨，实际达到一千二百二十七万吨；棉纱，计划达到八百万件至九百万件，实际达到八百二十五万件；棉布，计划达到七十二亿九千万米至八十亿六千万米，实际达到七十五亿米；盐，计划达到一千万吨至一千一百万吨，实际达到一千一百零四万吨；机制纸，计划达到一百五十万吨至一百六十万吨，实际达到一百七十万吨；粮食，计划达到五千亿斤左右，实际达到五千四百零一亿斤；棉花，计划达到四千八百万担左右，实际达到四千八百二十万担；大豆，计划达到二百五十亿斤左右，实际达到二百三十亿斤。一九五九年的产量没有达到第二个五年计划规定的一九六二年指标的有九种，即：原油、铝锭、化学肥料、食用植物油、糖、猪、牛、马、羊，但是，除糖和牲畜以外，它们的每年平均增长速度都超过了计划的要求。
    我们在两年内完成了原定的第二个五年计划的主要指标，争取了三年的时间，这就能够在第二个五年计划期间使国民经济的发展水平大大超过原来的设想。现在，国家计划委员会正会同各部门和各地区，根据前两年大跃进的实际经验，拟定第二个五年计划后三年的补充计划草案。
    两年的连续大跃进，证明了党中央和毛泽东同志规定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是一个伟大的创造。它集中地反映了我国六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的状况、把我国建成为一个强大的社会主义国家的热烈愿望，也确切地反映了社会主义经济的优越性和高速度发展的必然性。这条总路线把一切积极的因素都调动起来，使我国的社会主义建设事业出现了大跃进的情况。
    我国的社会主义建设总路线有着极丰富的内容。它的出发点是：人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素。人民群众从旧社会解放出来，在社会主义制度下成为主人，就能够充分发挥积极性和创造性，使生产建设得到高速度的发展。
    为了不断地发挥人民群众的积极性，遵循毛泽东同志所阐明的马克思列宁主义关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，我们不断地合理地解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾。根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。而生产力的不断发展，又迫使生产关系和上层建筑不能不进行不断的改革。当一九五六年生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利以后，我们接着在一九五七年进行了政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命，打垮了资产阶级右派向社会主义的猖狂进攻，进行了全民的整风运动，开展了大规模的共产主义教育，激发了全国人民建设社会主义的积极性和创造性。坚决地从经济上、政治上、思想上全面地进行社会主义革命，坚决地不断地肃清旧社会遗留下来的各种影响，破除各色各样的迷信，把人从各方面解放出来，这是一九五八年开创历史上从来没有过的大跃进的新局面的重要原因。由于人民群众政治觉悟的提高，由于大跃进形势的开展，我国广大农村实现了人民公社化。这种规模更大、公有化程度更高、工农商学兵相结合、政社合一的人民公社，是加快我国社会主义建设的最好的社会基层组织形式，在将来，是我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制、由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好的组织形式。它进一步地把我国五亿多农民群众的力量调动起来和组织起来。一九五九年在全国播种面积有百分之三十遭受了严重自然灾害的情况下，我国农业生产继续得到大跃进的发展，证明了人民公社有强大的生命力和无比的优越性。现在，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动。这一切，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造。
    一九五八年和一九五九年，我们在全民所有制的企业中，在国家机关中，在管理体制、规章制度、劳动关系、领导方法等方面进行了一系列的改革。除了一部分带全国性的重大企业以外，我们把原来由中央部门管理的企业，下放给省、市、自治区管理；原来由省、市、自治区管理的许多企业，也下放给专区或县管理，实行了统一领导和分级管理相结合的制度。在资金和物资的使用等方面，扩大了企业的管理权限。在广大的企业中，贯彻执行了民主集中制，实行了党委领导下的厂长负责制和职工代表大会制，改革了不合理的规章制度，实行了干部参加劳动、工人参加管理的制度，并且在生产活动中采用了干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法。在国家机关中，我们也实行了干部参加体力劳动和下放锻炼的制度，同时要求所有的领导干部都以普通劳动者的身份出现，以平等的态度待人。在工资福利制度方面，我们实行了政治思想教育和物质鼓励相结合而以政治思想教育为主的原则，实行了增加集体福利和增加个人收入相结合而逐步提高集体福利比重的原则，实行了计时工资为主、计件工资和奖励工资为辅的原则。所有这些，就进一步改善了中央与地方、领导与被领导以及人与人在劳动和其他社会活动中的相互关系。这样一来，上下打成一片，成为完全平等的兄弟般的关系，也就进一步地激发了广大职工建设社会主义的热情和自觉性。我们一定要把领导上的老爷式作风、官僚主义作风、命令主义作风，完全消灭得干干净净。要达到这个目的，不是短时间内所能完成的，需要一个长期过程，需要每一年整风一次，彻底批判那些老爷式的和官僚主义、命令主义的人们，把他们的缺点改变过来。
    我们在社会主义建设中，贯彻执行了一套“两条腿走路”的方针，即：在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举；在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举。这一套方针，不仅调动了广大城市人民的积极性，而且调动了五亿多农民又发展农业又发展工业的积极性；不仅调动了广大职工的积极性，而且调动了广大职工家属的积极性；不仅调动了中央各部门办工业和其他企业、事业的积极性，而且调动了各级地方以及人民公社办工业和其他企业、事业的积极性；不仅调动了技术水平比较高的人们的积极性，而且调动了技术水平比较低以至没有技术的人们的积极性。这就是说，这一套方针，可以把我国人民群众的积极性全面地充分地调动起来，互相协调地有计划地从各方面进行努力，集中到社会主义建设事业上面。
    实行这一套“同时并举”的方针，就有可能高速度、按比例地发展社会主义计划经济。工业和农业的比例关系，是国民经济中最基本的比例关系。农业是国民经济的基础，工业是国民经济的主导。在重工业优先发展的条件下，实行工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举，就既可以保证生产资料的优先增长，又可以保证消费资料的迅速增长，也就既可以保证国家建设规模的迅速扩大，又可以保证人民生活水平的不断提高。在两年的大跃进中，我国工业生产增长了百分之一百三十一点五，农业生产增长了百分之四十五点八；在工业中，重工业增长了百分之一百九十点九，轻工业增长了百分之七十九点一。这就说明，在重工业大跃进的同时，农业和轻工业也取得了大跃进，它们之间的比例关系更加协调了，生产资料和消费资料的比例关系也更加协调了。
    由于我们在工业方面执行了这一套“同时并举”的方针，我国工业的分布进一步合理了，资源的利用更扩大了，并且使一部分生产中的薄弱环节也赶上来了。在短短的两年中，我们就建设起一千三百多个“小洋群”炼铁企业，其中有二百个左右可以发展成为中型的或小型的钢铁联合企业。现在钢铁工业的布局和以前大不相同了，除西藏地方外，全国每个省、市、自治区都有了规模不同的钢铁企业。钢铁工业的发展，带动了其他工业的发展。各个地区按照自己的资源等条件兴办了各种各样的工业。这样就能够一步一步地使工业同农业密切地结合起来，使工业企业接近原料产地和消费地区，使我国工业形成星罗棋布、遍地开花的局面。在两年的大跃进中，大型的洋法生产的企业起了骨干的作用，中小型的洋法、土法或洋土结合的生产企业也起了很大的作用。在一九五九年生产的二千零五十万吨的生铁（不包括土铁）中，由中小型企业生产的为一千一百零五万吨，占二分之一以上；在一九五九年生产的一千三百三十五万吨钢（不包括土钢）中，由中小型转炉生产的为四百七十二万吨，占三分之一以上。应当指出，在一九五八年开始建立起来的“小土群”企业，特别是炼铁、炼钢和采煤的企业，经过整顿、提高，绝大多数生产规模扩大了，技术水平提高了，变成了洋法生产或者洋土结合的企业，它们在生产中将发挥愈来愈大的作用。
    在一切经济工作中，我们不断地加强了党的领导，实行了政治挂帅，开展了大规模的群众运动，使社会主义事业轰轰烈烈地和生气勃勃地向前发展。一切事业的胜利都要依靠群众，一切工作的进行都要走群众路线，这是我们坚定不移的原则。一九五八年以来，我们在各个经济战线上，一个运动接着一个运动，打破了妨碍生产发展的旧制度，建立了有利生产发展的新制度。在运动中，锻炼了广大干部，也锻炼了更广大的人民群众；发挥了人们的苦干、实干的精神，也发挥了人们巧干的智慧。学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进、大协作的社会主义竞赛，已经在各地各种企业中开展起来，形成了热潮。这种热潮提高了劳动生产率，提高了产品的质量，降低了产品的成本，并且有效地进行了技术革新和技术革命，使国民经济更能多快好省地向前发展。
    我们的一切经济工作是以政治为统帅的，我们的群众运动是在党的集中领导下进行的。党和政府号召人民群众破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢做的精神。党和政府在个人消费品的分配制度方面实行按劳分配的原则，同时教育人民群众为远大的目标而艰苦奋斗，不斤斤计较个人的报酬。在机关、团体、学校、企业和事业单位中，在人民公社中，运用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的形式，开展批评和自我批评，由人民群众自己教育自己。这样就保证了每个劳动者能够经常地保持着充沛的热情和干劲，能够顽强地克服困难，能够大胆地创造。
    一九五九年党内一小部分右倾机会主义分子反对党的总路线、生产大跃进和人民公社的运动，他们进行宗派组织，实行分裂党的活动，从党内向党的大多数举行猖狂的进攻。这是社会上无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争在党内的反映。我国各个方面的社会主义革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，但是社会上总还有一小部分人不满意和反对社会主义制度，企图恢复资本主义制度。党内的这些右倾机会主义分子，就是社会上反社会主义分子的代言人。他们反对党的社会主义建设总路线，反对大跃进和人民公社，实质上就是要恢复资本主义制度。一九五九年八月在庐山举行的党的八届八中全会，彻底地粉碎了党内右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻，随后在全国范围内开展了反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约的群众运动，实现了一九五九年的连续大跃进。
    一九五八年和一九五九年的伟大实践，使我们取得了丰富的经验。这些经验告诉我们：在社会主义制度下，用大跃进的速度发展国民经济，是完全可能的，是客观的必然性。国民经济总是经历不平衡到平衡再到不平衡的发展过程，而每一次反复，也就把生产水平提高一步，国民经济就在这样的波浪式的运动中不断地向前发展。两年来，由于我们从实践中逐步认识和掌握了这样的规律，我们既抓紧关键性的生产部门，使它首先跃进，同时不断地使落后部门赶上先进的部门，因而也就出现了国民经济各部门全面的跃进。这种全面跃进，不但保证了国民经济基本比例关系的协调，而且保证了某些局部的比例关系的失调现象得到迅速克服。正是因为这样，我国国民经济的跃进局面必将持续地发展下去，并且将跃进得愈来愈好。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国整个社会主义建设时期的三个法宝，这是毛泽东思想的产物。毛泽东同志在社会主义建设过程中，同在民主革命和社会主义革命过程中一样，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，制定了党的总路线和有关的一套方针，丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。总路线和有关的一套方针，充分地全面地发挥了人民群众的主观能动性，不断地改革了生产关系和上层建筑以适应生产力发展的要求，并且使国民经济大跃进的高速度发展和有计划的按比例发展能够统一地结合起来。这样，我国的社会主义建设事业就沿着正确的轨道突飞猛进地向前发展。毛泽东思想的旗帜，就是胜利的旗帜。认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证。
    二
    一九六○年是我国发展社会主义建设事业的极为重要的一年。全国人民努力争取这一年国民经济的继续跃进，就将为第二个五年计划期间以至整个六十年代的连续跃进奠定基础。
    一九六○年发展国民经济的任务，总的说来是：更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线，在过去两年连续跃进的基础上，争取国民经济继续全面的更好的跃进。为着实现这个任务，一九六○年国民经济计划的安排，应当进一步地确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合；应当继续执行工业以钢为纲、农业以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，并且进一步加强运输业、动力工业、采掘工业等部门；以便更加适当地处理重工业、轻工业、农业各部门之间及各部门内部各行各业之间的关系，使国民经济跃进得更好。
    农业对于发展国民经济有着极端重要的作用，它是国民经济的基础。农业更快地发展了，不但可以保证轻工业更快的发展，而且可以保证重工业的优先发展。加快农业的发展，认真地贯彻实行农业发展纲要四十条，是高速度、按比例地发展我国社会主义计划经济的中心环节。进一步确定以农业为基础的方针，是完全合乎社会主义经济发展的客观要求的。贯彻执行这个方针，必然有利于国民经济的继续跃进。
    为了更快地发展农业，在一九六○年，要在进一步发挥人民公社的优越性的同时，积极地推进农业的技术改造，提高农业的劳动生产率。我国人民公社化的实现，一方面对农业的技术改造提出了迫切的要求，另一方面为农业的技术改造创造了有利的条件。我国的工业经过第一个五年计划的建设，接着又实现了两年的连续大跃进，为农业的技术改造创立了必要的物质技术基础。在合作化时期，我们曾经批判了没有机械化就不能实行合作化的观点，那是完全必要的。在当时，如果我们坐待机械化而延缓农业的合作化，就不能保证农业的增产，也就不能保证工业的发展，也就不能保证工农联盟的巩固。现在，当农业技术改造的各种条件已经具备的时候，如果我们不积极地推进农业的技术改造，使农业的发展能够适应工业迅速发展的需要，能够适应整个国民经济和人民生活日益增长的需要，我们就要犯错误。在过去十年中，我国工农联盟已经经历了两个阶段，即土地改革阶段和合作化阶段。在农村已经实现了人民公社化的条件下，我们应当把工农联盟推进到一个新的阶段，使工业积极支援农业，使农业逐步地建立在现代化的基础上。
    根据我国现时的情况，进行农业的技术改造必须有计划有步骤地进行。在农业机械化方面，我们努力的目标是：从一九五九年起，争取四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决。在十年左右的时间，争取在全国范围内基本上实现农业机械化和水利化，并且实现相当程度的电气化。我们的方针是：机械化和半机械化同时并举，洋的和土的同时并举，在最近三年内还要以改良农具和半机械化农具为主。这就要求国营工业努力增产农业机械和农业所必需的其他生产资料，同时要求全国农民群众大搞改良农具和工具的技术革新运动。采取这样的方针，我们就可能调动一切积极因素，加速我国农业技术改造的进程。在农业的技术改造中，应当遵守因地制宜的原则，同时必须和农业“八字宪法”的各项办法密切结合，和我国精耕细作的优良传统密切结合，使新技术在农业生产中发挥最大的效果。
    为了促进农业的迅速发展，工业、运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各个部门，都要把支援农业当做自己的重要任务，并且适应这个任务的要求，具体安排本部门的工作。
    一九六○年的农业生产，应当继续以粮为纲，在保证粮食增产的条件下，全面安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂各类农作物的生产，并且实行农、林、牧、副、渔同时并举，争取农业的全面大发展。在畜牧业的发展中，应当把养猪放在首要地位，开展一个大规模的群众性的养猪运动，掀起一个全面发展畜牧业的新高潮；使农、林、牧三者相互结合，相互促进，共同发展。为了保证农业的增产，除了积极进行农业的技术改造以外，各地方还应当继续开展大中小型工程相结合的水利建设运动，增加和改善灌溉面积，提高防旱、防涝、防洪的能力。
    在争取农业全面地、迅速地发展的基础上，一九六○年应当努力从多方面扩大轻工业原料的来源，加强资源的综合利用，加快轻工业的发展，以保证各种轻工业品有更多的供应。
    一九六○年重工业在优先发展中，应当努力加强对农业的支援。这是工业战线的一项光荣任务。加强工业对农业的支援，就将加快农业的发展，同时也将加快工业本身的发展。我们的各个重工业部门，都应当树立为农业服务的观点，把支援农业技术改造看成自己应尽的责任。中央管理的大型现代化的有关的工业企业，应当努力增产适合于农业需要的生产资料；各级地方工业和社办工业更应当充分发挥自己的力量，采取洋土结合的办法，从多方面推进农业的技术改造。
    重工业的发展，应当继续执行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针。在过去两年的连续大跃进中，各个重工业部门都有了相当大的发展，它们之间的关系是更加趋于协调了，某些原来薄弱的部门正在很快地赶上来。但是，也还有一些薄弱部门需要继续努力加强。在一九六○年的重工业建设中，应当继续抓紧钢铁工业的建设，同时努力加强动力工业、采掘工业、有色金属工业、石油工业、合成橡胶工业等这些部门的建设，使它们更好地适应于整个工业以及整个国民经济继续跃进的需要。一九六○年各个重工业部门都应当加强资源综合利用的工作。
    大力发展交通运输业，以适应工农业生产发展的需要，是一九六○年发展国民经济的一项重要任务。在发挥现有交通运输设备潜力的同时，要努力加强交通运输的基本建设，继续以铁路为重点，增加机车和车辆，增建新的铁路干线和支线，同时加强公路和港口的建设，努力实现装卸搬运的机械化和半机械化，发展和改造民间的运输工具。
    一九六○年将继续进行大规模的基本建设。在建设计划的安排中，必须更好地体现几个“同时并举”的方针。在注意安排工业投资的比重的同时，适当提高水利、农业和林业投资的比重，提高运输业投资的比重。各项建设，除了继续注意必要的大型项目的建设以外，应当特别注意增加中小型项目的建设。各个工业部门和交通运输部门，各个地方和人民公社，在一九六○年都应当继续积极地发展一批“小洋群”企业和“小土群”企业，同时提高原有的“小洋群”企业和“小土群”企业的生产水平。在有煤有铁的地方，都要积极建立一批新的采煤、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢的“小洋群”企业，或者“小土群”企业，以带动其他行业的“小洋群”或“小土群”企业的发展，并且适应生产建设发展的需要，根据各地自己的可能条件，建设必要数量的小洋铁路或者小土铁路。为了发挥地方和企业的积极性和主动性，在投资安排上应当给地方以必要的机动权，并且推广基本建设投资包干的办法。在项目的安排上，要注意遍地开花，合理布局，更好地贯彻执行合理利用老工业基地和积极建设新工业基地相结合的方针。一九六○年要适当增加学校校舍、职工宿舍的建设，增加城市公用事业的建设。
    一九六○年，无论那一个部门，都必须把以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动进一步开展起来，积极发展机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的群众运动，鼓励和支持劳动群众和科学技术人员创造发明的积极性，继续推广有效的先进经验，努力节约原材料，提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，增加新品种，降低成本，改革企业管理和劳动组织。
    根据上述任务、方针以及可能的条件，一九六○年计划草案拟定的主要指标如下：工农业总产值为二千九百八十亿元，比一九五九年增长百分之二十三。其中，工业总产值为二千一百亿元，增长百分之二十九；农业总产值为八百八十亿元，增长百分之十二。一九六○年国家预算内的基本建设投资为三百二十五亿元（地方和企业自筹的投资约六十亿元不在此数之内），比一九五九年增长百分之二十一点七。在投资总额中，工业部门占百分之五十八点三，农业、水利、林业、气象部门占百分之十二，运输邮电部门占百分之二十点九，科学研究和文教卫生部门占百分之三点五，商业部门占百分之一点三，城市建设占百分之二点八，其他占百分之一点二。在投资总额中，分配给中央各部门直属企业的投资是一百六十三亿五千万元，占百分之五十点三；分配给地方企业的投资是一百六十一亿五千万元，占百分之四十九点七。
    一九六○年国民经济计划是继续跃进的计划，又是经过努力可以完成和超额完成的计划。胜利地实现这个计划，我们就可能争取用比十年更少的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，并且提前实现一九五六年至一九六七年全国农业发展纲要。

    现在，我就重工业，重工业支援农业，农业，轻工业，农村人民公社工业、城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业，交通运输业，商业，劳动工资，科学研究和文教卫生事业等九个方面，来分别地说明一九六○年计划指标的安排情况。
    （一）重工业
    一九六○年的重工业总产值拟定为一千二百七十亿元，比一九五九年增长百分之三十二。
    为了进一步扩大重工业的基础，更有力地支援农业、运输业和轻工业的建设，今年将继续发展钢铁、有色金属、酸、碱、水泥、木材、合成橡胶等原料材料工业的生产。计划拟定，生铁（不包括土铁）的产量达到二千七百五十万吨，比上年增长百分之三十四；钢（不包括土钢）一千八百四十万吨，增长百分之三十八；硫酸一百五十万吨，增长百分之四十二；水泥一千六百万吨，增长百分之三十；木材四千七百万立方米，增长百分之十四。同时，将更多地发展电力、煤炭、石油等燃料、动力工业的生产，计划拟定，发电量达到五百五十五亿至五百八十亿度，增长百分之三十四至百分之四十；煤炭四亿二千五百万吨，增长百分之二十二；原油五百二十万吨，增长百分之四十一。在机械制造方面，计划拟定生产发电设备三百三十万瓩，增长百分之五十三；生产金属切削机床九万台，增长百分之二十九；并且尽可能提高了农业机械的增长速度，拖拉机将增产两倍以上，机引农具、动力脱粒机将增产一倍半左右。大力提高运输设备的增长速度，铁路机车、货车和载重汽车等都将增产百分之五十以上，轮驳船将增产百分之三十七。轻工业所需设备的生产，也根据实际的需要作了安排。
    一九六○年重工业各部门在技术革新和技术革命运动中要努力挖掘潜力，增加品种和提高质量，争取在数量上、品种上和质量上都继续跃进。钢铁工业要努力提高高炉和转炉的利用系数，降低矿石、生铁和煤炭的消耗，提高优质钢和合金钢的比重，并且增加钢轨、钢板、钢管和优质钢材的产量和新品种。煤炭工业要更多地增产主焦煤和洗煤，降低煤炭的灰分。机械工业要增加大型的和精密的产品的生产，等等。
    一九六○年重工业各部门基本建设的安排情况如下：
    钢铁工业，限额以上建设项目共七十三个，包括鞍钢、武钢、包钢等钢铁基地的续建工程，和分布在各省、市、自治区的大型的及中型的钢铁联合企业。各地方在有计划地建设一批新的“小洋群”钢铁企业的同时，要积极地加强矿山、炼焦、运输等环节，使它们同冶炼能力相适应。
      有色金属工业，在保证必要的大型有色金属项目的建设以外，积极地建设地方中小型的有色金属企业，大力发展有色金属的“小洋群”和“小土群”企业。
    电力工业，限额以上建设项目一百九十二个，其中火力电站一百一十五个，水力电站四十九个，输电变电工程二十八个。一九六○年新安装的发电设备安排为四百二十万瓩。
    煤炭工业，限额以上建设项目八十一个。在计划中，着重地安排了华东以及西南、西北和中南等地区的新煤矿基地的建设，并且注意小型煤矿的发展，以便逐步实现煤炭生产的合理分布，减少北煤南运的数量。
    石油工业，限额以上建设项目十七个。建设的重点是：继续进行各地区天然油田的建设和勘探工作，继续加强人造石油的建设。为了迅速地增加原油的产量，一九六○年将积极建设中小型人造石油厂。各地方和人民公社还应当根据资源和其他条件的可能，举办土法的简易的煤炼油厂。
    机械工业，限额以上建设项目二百零三个。其中，农业机械的建设项目五十五个，主要的有：洛阳拖拉机厂第二期，天津拖拉机厂，北京农业机械厂等。农业机械投资的百分之四十八用之于限额以下项目，这些建设项目统由地方安排，以便使产品适合于当地的具体需要。在安排中，还注意了配套项目和修配厂的建设。机械工业的建设，除了加强农业机械以外，主要是增加铸造和锻压的能力，增加大型和精密机械的制造能力，以及增加通用机械、电器和仪器仪表等配套设备的制造能力。
    化学工业，限额以上建设项目六十七个。建设的重点是化肥、酸、碱和合成橡胶。化学肥料工业，将继续建设十七个大型企业，并且在全国各地建设一百四十多个中小型企业。积极发展合成橡胶。
    建筑材料工业和森林工业，限额以上建设项目一百二十九个。建筑材料工业将加强水泥、玻璃、陶瓷工业的建设，积极进行非金属矿的建设。森林工业除了继续开发东北和内蒙林区以外，将开发四川、福建等地的新林区。同时，增加锯材的生产能力，积极发展以人造板为主的木材综合利用。
    为了多快好省地实现重工业基本建设计划，各部门应当首先抓紧续建工程，使这些工程及早建成投入生产。各部门都应当加强对设计工作的领导，提高设计人员的政治、技术水平，鼓励设计人员进一步解放思想，使各方面的设计吸取先进经验，更好地符合多快好省的要求。所有基本建设单位都应当积极采用快速施工方法。
    （二）重工业支援农业
    在各部门普遍地支援农业的中间，重工业负有特别重要的任务。
    为着加速农业的技术改造，计划草案规定一九六○年由国家分配的用于制造农业机械和农具的钢材为一百一十万吨，比一九五九年增长一倍左右。由国内生产的、为农业直接提供的产品，有拖拉机二万二千台，联合收割机二千台，排灌机械二百五十万马力，载重汽车八千五百辆，化肥二百八十万吨，农药十八万吨，胶轮手推车一千万辆，小型水力发电设备二十万瓩至三十万瓩。此外，半机械化的农具和小农具将有更多的增加。
    一九六○年农业方面将增加机械动力五百多万马力。在这一年，机耕面积将达到一亿亩以上，比一九五九年增加百分之四十左右；机械灌溉面积将达到二亿亩以上，比一九五九年增加一倍。
    随着农业技术改造的加速进行，需要及时着手解决农业机械修配站的建立、技术人材的培养、新式农业机械的试验研究等一系列的问题。现在各个地方正在进行具体规划和着手解决。
    工业企业除了增加农业生产资料的生产以外，还应当组织服务队传授技术，帮助公社培养技术干部，帮助公社办工厂，给农业多方面的支援。为了做好这些支援工作，要提倡工厂和公社直接“挂钩”、办“试验田”、分片“包干”的办法。
    （三）农业
    计划拟定，一九六○年农业总产值增长百分之十二，粮食、棉花的产量各增长百分之十左右，猪的饲养头数增长百分之三十五左右。
    各地方在安排农业生产的时候，应当按照以粮为纲、全面发展农林牧副渔的要求，切实注意：1．首先保证粮食的增产，并且掌握主粮、杂粮和饲料的适当比例。2．在保证粮食增产的同时，使经济作物获得较快的发展。棉花、油料、麻类、烟叶、糖料五项主要经济作物要有较多的增产，蔬菜的生产仍然要继续抓紧，茶叶、蚕茧、药材、果品和其他农产品也要积极发展。3．大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业，认真解决牲畜的饲料、饲草问题，并且建立和健全对牲畜的繁殖、饲养、使用的责任制度和奖励办法，加强防治牲畜疾病的工作。4．积极组织劳动力，充分利用农闲时间，发展各类副业和土特产品的生产。5．提高农产品的商品率，加强农产品商品基地的建设，争取在这些地方先一步实现农业的技术改造。6．发挥国营农场的优越性，使国营农场为国家提供更多的农产品和畜产品。
    把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位，而在畜牧业中又把养猪放在首要地位，这是促进农业全面发展的重要步骤。一头猪就是一个小型的有机化肥工厂。抓住了养猪问题，就抓住了多快好省地增产肥料的关键。猪大量地增加起来，畜牧业大量发展起来，也就解决了肉食的供应，并且扩大了轻工业的原料来源。在一九六○年开展大规模养猪运动的同时，要积极发展牛、羊、驴、骡、马、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等家畜和家禽，要注意发展养蜂。
    为了保证一九六○年农业生产计划的胜利实现，就要进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，继续巩固和发展人民公社。在抓紧农业技术改造的同时，要继续执行土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工的“八字宪法”。人民公社的继续发展，“八字宪法”的更好运用，农业技术改造的逐步实现，这三者结合起来，我国的农业生产就能够稳定而迅速地向前发展。
    各地方、各农村人民公社在抓紧农业生产建设的同时，要妥善地安排农村人民的生活，大力办好公共食堂。
    一九六○年农业、水利、林业和气象部门的基本建设投资拟定为三十九亿一千万元，比一九五九年增长百分之六十二点九。要求在一九六○年改善灌溉面积二亿亩，扩大灌溉面积六千万亩，增加治涝面积六千万亩，造林二亿亩，初步实施水土保持措施的面积增加十万至十五万平方公里。为了实现这些要求，一九六○年的水利建设，按照“蓄、小、群”为主和大中小型工程相结合的方针，除兴修大型水库以外，还将兴修大量的中小型防洪、灌溉和水力综合利用工程。河南三门峡、湖北丹江口、河北岳城镇等大型水利工程都将进行大规模施工。在农业的基本建设方面，将扩大国营农场的垦荒面积，加强橡胶农场的建设。
    （四）轻工业
    一九六○年的轻工业总产值拟定为八百三十亿元，比一九五九年增长百分之二十四。
    根据原料供应的可能，各种主要轻工业产品的指标如下：
      棉纱，九百万件，增长百分之九。
    棉布，七十六亿米，增长百分之一点三。
    针织品，用纱一百五十万件，增长百分之二十。
    纸，二百八十万吨，增长百分之三十一。
    糖，一百三十万吨，增长百分之十五。
    食用植物油，一百七十万吨，增长百分之十六。
    盐，一千四百万吨，增长百分之二十七。
    水产品，五百八十万吨，增长百分之十六。
    卷烟，六百万箱，增长百分之九。
    轻工业增产的关键仍然在于扩大原料来源，这就需要农业部门、重工业部门和商业部门多方面同时努力。一九六○年，在农业方面，应当保证完成经济作物的播种面积，保证为经济作物调配较多的化肥和农药，以争取增产更多的轻工业原料；还应当大量地组织群众，采集野生植物，收集一切可以利用的轻工业原料。在重工业方面，应当增加基本化学产品的生产，尽可能实行煤炭、木材的综合利用，增加轻工业所需要的各种原料；应当生产一些小型的加工机械，供应人民公社的需要；原料、材料、燃料和动力的供应应当尽可能地照顾轻工业的需要。在商业方面，应当加强对农副产品的收购工作和废品、废料的回收工作。
    轻工业部门除了提高产品质量、增加花色品种以外，应当千方百计地节约原料、材料，提高出品率，特别是提高植物油和糖的出品率；加强农业原料的综合利用，推广甘蔗渣造纸、棉子剥绒、米糠榨油、多穗高粱秆制糖等措施。
    一九六○年纺织、轻工、水产三个部门的基本建设投资安排为十四亿七千万元，其中百分之九十是地方所属企业的投资。限额以上建设项目共二百二十七个，其中纺织一百零五个，造纸四十个，制糖二十三个，制盐二十个，水产十个。全部建设的规模是：新增棉纺锭二百四十万枚，造纸能力一百一十万吨，制糖能力九十四万吨。
    在轻工业建设中，应当尽量照顾轻工业比较少而又有条件发展的地区；应当适应农业原料的分散性，多安排中小型的项目，使加工工厂尽量接近原料产地。
    （五）农村人民公社工业、城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业
    两年的大跃进，农村人民公社工业、城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业有了很大的发展，成为工业战线上的一支新生的力量。一九五九年农村人民公社工业的产值为一百亿元左右，比一九五八年增长百分之七十；城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业的产值为二十亿元左右，比一九五八年约增长四倍。一九六○年要求农村人民公社工业的产值比一九五九年增长百分之五十左右，城市人民公社工业和街道工业的产值增长一倍左右。在一九六○年要努力提高原有城乡公社工业和街道工业企业的技术水平，扩大生产规模，并且积极地发展一批新的“小土群”、“小洋群”或者洋土结合的企业。
    城乡公社工业和街道工业应当在国家计划的指导下，继续贯彻执行因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生、勤俭办企业的方针。农村人民公社工业要充分利用当地的原料材料，积极发展小型农具、改良农具和半机械化农具的制造和修配，发展农副产品加工，发展建筑材料的生产，为农业生产、为大工业、为市场和社员生活服务。城市人民公社工业和街道工业应当充分利用大工厂的边角废料和城市废品废料，生产为人民生活需要的日用工业品；同时，应当积极承制大工厂的来料加工，为大工业服务。
    中央和地方管理的国家企业，应当在技术传授、技术人员的训练和设备供应等方面，积极支援城乡人民公社工业和街道工业的合理发展。
    为加速城乡人民公社工业和街道工业的发展，各地区应当加强对城乡公社工业和街道工业的领导，全面规划，统筹安排，把它们逐级纳入地方计划，并且逐步纳入国家计划。
    （六）交通运输业
    一九六○年各种现代运输工具的货运量，计划拟定为十四亿三千万吨，比一九五九年增长百分之四十二。其中，铁路货运量七亿二千万吨，增长百分之三十三；汽车货运量五亿四千万吨，增长百分之五十七；轮船驳船货运量一亿七千万吨，增长百分之三十八。民间运输工具的货运量也将有很大的增长。
    在过去两年中，交通运输业获得了连续的大跃进，但是仍然赶不上工农业生产以及商品流转的需要。为了改变这种状况，必须从交通运输的各个方面、各个环节，千方百计地来发挥潜力，同时加快交通运输的建设。
    在发挥现有运输设备的潜力方面，应当进一步加强运输的组织工作，进一步规划和组织铁路、公路、水路和工矿企业之间的“一条龙”大协作，改进装卸工作，加速车船周转，加强厂矿内部的运输。大力组织机关、企业的汽车参加运输。充分利用民间的运输工具，适当加强人民公社的专业运输队伍，结合农业生产，利用农闲季节，继续开展短途运输的群众运动。同时，应当加强通信的组织工作，提高电信的传送效能，提高通信工作的全程效率。
    一九六○年运输和邮电部门的基本建设投资安排为六十八亿一千万元，比一九五九年增长百分之三十七点六。其中，铁道部门五十亿元，交通部门十五亿七千万元，邮电部门二亿四千万元。
    铁路建设。在安排中，执行了建设线路和增加车辆同时并举的方针，执行了建设新线和加强旧线同时并举，建设干线和建设支线、专用线同时并举，重轨铁路和轻轨铁路同时并举，洋铁路和土铁路同时并举的方针。
    计划拟定建设铁路干线二千零六十八公里，铁路支线二千零五十三公里，铁路复线一千二百二十三公里，铁路专用线二千公里，轻轨铁路一千零四十五公里。以上共计八千三百八十九公里，比一九五九年增加百分之八十二。此外，改建铁路四百二十一公里。各地方还将根据需要和可能大量地修建铁轨铁路。计划继续建设的铁路干线，有兰新线，内昆线，成昆线，川黔线，滇黔线，湘黔线，兰青线，侯马——西安线等。
    全年将增加机车八百台，货车三万二千辆，客车一千辆。
    公路建设。新建主要公路六千五百公里，改建主要公路一万九千公里。增加公路运输汽车九千辆，挂车二万辆。为适应农业生产发展的需要，将由地方和人民公社修建简易公路。
    水路建设。结合水利建设，增加主要内河通航里程八千公里以上。进行上海、天津、广州、秦皇岛、汉口等十六个主要港口的建设，增加装卸设备。增加轮船和驳船共二十万吨，增加动力机械十万马力以改造木帆船。
    民航建设。开辟国内航空线一万一千公里，增加各种新式客机。增加农业用飞机一百架左右，为农业服务。
    邮电建设。一九六○年继续加强干线的通讯建设，重点改造山西、山东等八个省市的长途电话线路。全年架设铜线一万三千余对公里。
    （七）商业
    一九六○年的社会商品零售总额拟定为七百二十五亿元，比一九五九年增长百分之十四。
    一九六○年主要副食品供应总值将增长百分之二十以上；针织品的品种和数量将有增加；日用工业品将有较多的增加，供应总值拟增长百分之四十以上。
    一九六○年供应农业的生产资料总值将达一百一十亿元，比一九五九年增长百分之三十五。
    商业工作，要进一步为生产和人民生活需要服务，积极组织适应农村需要的生产资料和日用消费品的供应，并且妥善地安排城市的商品供应，大力支援组织城市人民公社的工作。要保证完成和争取超额完成各种商品的收购任务，特别是农产品的收购任务。
    鉴于一九六○年社会购买力的增加部分主要在农村，地方工业企业和人民公社工业在安排生产的时候，应当注意多安排适合于农业生产和农民生活需要的产品。
    随着国民经济的继续跃进，一九六○年的对外贸易也将继续增长。对外贸易的工作，应当更好地执行以自力更生为主、争取外援为辅、积极支持工农业生产跃进的总方针。在这总方针下，根据国际主义精神，进一步加强同各社会主义兄弟国家的贸易来往和经济合作，促进彼此经济的共同高涨；根据平等互利、互通有无的原则，发展同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区国家的经济贸易联系。对于西方资本主义国家，我们也愿在平等互利的条件下同它们发展贸易关系，但是必须坚决反对某些西方国家在贸易上歧视我国的各种措施。
    一九六○年各商业部门的基本建设投资安排为四亿三千三百万元，比一九五九年增长百分之十三点九。主要是进行仓库、油库和加工厂的建设。
    （八）劳动工资
    一九六○年必须努力提高劳动生产率，争取做到老厂增产不增人，并且尽可能抽出人来支援新厂；新厂根据实际需要增加生产工人，但是应当尽量降低辅助工人和非直接生产人员的比重。
    计划拟定工业部门的劳动生产率提高百分之二十五左右，铁路运输部门的劳动生产率提高百分之二十左右，建筑安装的劳动生产率提高百分之二十左右。
    由于许多企业在技术革新和技术革命运动开展以后大大提高了劳动生产率，将抽出一部分职工支援新建的企业，因此一九六○年计划拟只增加职工一百八十万人。为了适应生产建设继续跃进的需要，必须加强新工人的培养训练工作。
    一九六○年职工平均工资拟增加百分之六，工资总额增加二十六亿元。增加的工资，主要用于职工升级和必要的奖励，工资标准基本不动。一九六○年国家用于职工的劳动保险金、医药费、福利费以及其他集体福利事业的开支，拟增加百分之十左右。由于就业面的扩大和集体福利的增加，职工家庭的实际生活水平将有较多的提高。
    一切企业都要加强劳动保护工作，贯彻安全生产的方针。
    （九）科学研究和文教卫生事业
    在教育事业方面，一九六○年各类学校的招生数拟定为：高等学校二十八万人，中等专业学校六十万人，高中八十万人，初中四百万人，农业中学和其他职业中学二百八十万人。为适应农业大发展的需要，计划拟定高等农业学校招生二万四千人，中等农业技术学校招生八万人。
    一九六○年小学招生二千一百万人。
    在发展全日制、半日制学校教育的同时，一九六○年各地方、各部门、各企业、各人民公社还要大力发展业余教育。
    为了实现上述任务，应当在加强领导、全面规划的条件下，采取多种多样的办学形式，充分调动社会上各个方面的办学的积极性。在发展教育事业中，必须继续加强党的领导，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，坚持普及和提高相结合的方针。各省、市、自治区，各专区和县，在国家计划的指导下，都要积极地发展为本地方生产建设服务的中等学校和高等学校。
    在科学研究事业方面，积极增加研究人员，增设研究机构，增加必要的设备和仪器。要进一步密切科学研究、教育、生产三者之间的结合，即：在科学研究机关中，以科学研究为主，同时进行培养干部和小规模的生产；在高等学校和中等专业学校中，以培养干部为主，同时进行科学研究和小规模的生产；在生产企业中，以生产为主，同时进行科学研究和培养干部。要动员各方面的力量，努力学习、研究和掌握世界上最新的科学技术成就，总结群众实践的丰富经验，为争取在比较短的时间内实现十二年科学技术规划而奋斗。
    在文化事业方面，实行“全面规划，积极发展，重点建设，提高质量”的方针，以保证文化事业更好地配合和促进工农业生产的大跃进，为技术革命和文化革命服务，掀起建设社会主义文化的高潮。在电影方面，一九六○年摄制电影故事片八十部，发展放映单位（主要是农村放映队）四千个左右；要注意加强科学教育影片的摄制和放映工作。在出版方面，要特别注意保证马克思列宁主义经典著作和毛泽东著作的出版和供应，加强课本、扫盲读物和科学技术书籍的出版工作。继续努力发展群众文化活动，特别是农村文化活动。加强干部培养和文化艺术队伍的改造和提高。大力发展少数民族和边远地区的文化事业。
    在卫生事业方面，继续大力开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的群众卫生运动，推广山西省稷山县和广东省佛山市的卫生运动的经验。应当充分发动群众，大张旗鼓，大作宣传，使家喻户晓，人人动作起来，并且使卫生运动与生产大跃进和文化、技术革命互相结合。要以县医院为中心加强农村医疗预防工作，积极支援农业生产。一九六○年计划发展医院病床四万五千张，并且大力发展简易病床。
    继续大力开展城乡的群众性的体育运动，要提倡做操、打球、赛跑、爬山、游水、射击、打拳及各色各样的体育活动，并且在普及的基础上，提高运动水平。
    一九六○年科学研究和文教卫生部门的基本建设投资安排为十一亿二千七百万元，比一九五九年增长百分之六十五点七，其中教育部门的投资增长将近一倍。四
    为了胜利地实现一九六○年的跃进计划，为了加快社会主义建设事业的发展，我国广大的工人、农民和知识分子，正在以破竹之势，开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动。在运动中，新人新事层出不穷，革新创举到处开花，共产主义风格更加发扬。由于这个运动广泛的深入的开展，我国广大的城市和农村，就出现了像一九五八年大炼钢铁时候那样的沸腾景象。
    当前各个战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，中心内容是与生产密切结合，逐步实现机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化。这是一个具有广泛群众性的伟大运动。现在，在工业和交通运输部门，已经有百分之八十以上的职工参加到运动中来，积极地提出和实现技术革新的建议。在农村，在商业、财政、金融部门和科学文教卫生部门，广大群众都参加了改革工具和改进操作方法的斗争，把实干、苦干和巧干结合起来。在许多地方、许多企业中，已经由单项技术的革新发展成为成套技术的革新，由一个企业、一个行业的革新发展成为企业之间、行业之间的“一条龙”的大协作。这些特点表明，我国人民征服落后技术的伟大进军，已经在全国范围内开始发动起来了。当然，这只是事情的开端，但是，这是一个极为可喜的开端。
    具有广泛群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，是不断进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、文化革命的必然结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物。凡是认真开展了这个运动的单位，就能够迅速提高劳动生产率，就能够又多又快又好又省地完成国家计划，而且群众的思想觉悟也就不断提高。在许多单位中，共产主义大协作的精神更为发扬，个人主义和本位主义思想迅速减少；先进分子大大增加，落后分子和中间分子大大减少。学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进、抢困难、让方便，正在成为新的社会风气和道德标准。这个运动必将加快我国工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的进程，进一步提高社会主义建设的速度，进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和科学技术文化水平。我们应当把这个运动更广泛地、更深入地开展起来，使它不断地巩固、发展和提高，使它沿着正确的科学的全民的道路前进。
    在运动中，我们长期坚持的方向是：要普遍地使单项技术的革新发展成为成套技术的革新，使各个企业、各个行业、各个部门的革新互相配合，形成系统。就一个企业的范围来说，要把单个工序、单个车间的技术革新发展成为整个工序、整个企业的技术革新，并且使原料材料供应、生产、运输等各个环节彼此衔接。就一个行业和一个部门的范围来说，要把同类企业的各种技术革新的经验“配起套”来，形成成套的经验，形成系统的经验，使技术革新系列化。在有关的企业之间、行业之间和部门之间，要组织“一条龙”的大协作，工业部门和农业部门要互相支援，生产部门和运输、流通部门要互相支援，企业部门和科学研究部门要互相支援，使技术革新和技术革命成为国民经济全面的系统的互相配合的活动。在目前，采掘工业部门、原料材料工业部门、动力工业部门和运输部门，尤其应当加强对运动的领导，创造和推广能够大大增产节约的先进技术和先进经验，以适应加工工业和整个国民经济的需要。
    技术革新和技术革命的发展，势必要求上层建筑和生产关系的某些方面也要进行改革，来适应生产力发展的需要。因此，各地方、各部门、各企业在技术革新和技术革命取得某些重要的成就以后，紧跟着就要改进生产组织和劳动组织，改革那些已经不适用的规章制度，适当调整工资、奖励制度，等等。领导机关和领导人员，都要及时地加强工作，使上层建筑和生产关系的各个环节，同技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展相适应，促进运动的继续发展。
    各个地方、各个部门、各个企业、各个人民公社，对于技术革新和技术革命，既要进行短期安排，又要进行长期规划。在每个时期内，都要有明确的方向，实事求是地规定具体的任务，使技术革新和技术革命运动同增产节约的要求紧密地结合起来，并且集中力量，突破重点，解决关键问题，使运动一个高潮接着一个高潮地向前发展。
    在运动中，我们所创造的许多先进的生产技术和生产经验，应当普遍加以推广。各个地方、各个部门、各个企业、各个事业单位、各个人民公社、各个街道企业的领导人员，对于本地方、本部门、本单位创造的先进的生产技术和生产经验，以及群众的一切合理倡议，都应当满腔热情地加以支持，加以试验，加以总结，加以应用；对于别的地方、别的部门、别的单位创造的先进的生产技术和生产经验，也应当加以研究，加以推广。在推广中，可以采取多种多样的办法。许多地方采取的现场会议的形式，鞍钢创造的技术表演赛、黑龙江省创造的生产运动会等形式，都是好办法，可以普遍采用。
    在运动中，要采取大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、互相结合的方针。大跃进以来建立的“小土群”“小洋群”企业和技术落后的中小企业，在技术上已经有了很多的新创造。可以预料，通过这些企业的创造性活动，不仅有可能使它们在很短的时期内提高技术水平，而且将使我们找到一条多快好省地发展技术的道路。全国各地出现的大量的生动事例，都可证明这一点。例如，河北、安徽、山东、山西等省各有一批三立方米、八立方米、十三立方米的小高炉，每立方米容积每昼夜的出铁量，在相当长的时间内连续达到了两吨以上，有一些达到了三吨以上。我们应当继续发动“小土群”“小洋群”企业和技术落后的中小企业的职工群众，把运动不断地推向高潮。现代化大型企业的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动也已经普遍地开展起来，并且有了很多出色的创造。但是运动的发展是不平衡的，有一部分企业还发动得不够。我们应当批判那种认为现代化大型企业可以不搞或不能搞技术革新和技术革命的错误观点，而要加强领导，充分发动这类企业的职工群众，破除迷信，打破清规戒律，改革生产设备和工具，改进产品设计和生产工艺，改善操作方法，使它们在技术革新和技术革命运动中发挥更多的作用。
    在运动中，还应当采取洋土并举的方针。目前无论在农业、工业、运输业中，都有许多先进生产单位采取土办法，实现了手工操作的机械化和半机械化。就是在新技术的采用中间，也有许多是用土办法来完成的。事实证明，如同在生产中一样，在技术的改革中，可以而且也必须洋土并举，互相结合。能采取洋办法的就采取洋办法，能采取土办法的就采取土办法，或者采取半洋半土的办法。采取这样的办法，就可以在一个企业的范围内有效地执行自力更生为主的方针，来克服原料、材料、设备和技术力量不足的困难。
    技术革新和技术革命运动应当同目前在全国各地广泛开展的学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，使运动有正确思想的指导。为了使运动不断地健康地向前发展，我们应当坚持政治挂帅，坚决走群众路线，继续放手发动群众，对广大群众进行政治思想教育，使他们了解我国社会主义建设高速度发展的形势和运动的重大意义，鼓舞他们的冲天干劲和雄心壮志，并且继续破除迷信，解放思想，开动脑筋，发扬敢想敢做、互相帮助、不怕困难的精神。从无数的历史事实中看到，专家和技术人员可以改革旧技术和创造新技术，有生产实践经验的普通劳动者也可以甚至更可以改革旧技术和创造新技术。领导人员、工人群众、技术人员三者密切结合，同心协力，千方百计，就一定能够在技术上创造出奇迹。我们应当重视前人所取得的科学技术的成果，应当努力学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的经验，提高科学技术文化水平。我们应当把敢想敢做和科学分析结合起来，而不应当被已有的成就所束缚。任何新技术，往往是经过多次的试验才能成功的，应当不怕困难，不怕失败，而不应当被暂时的困难，失败所吓倒。我们在社会主义建设上已经取得了大跃进的速度，在技术改进上也应当争取大跃进的速度。生产的大跃进，不能不引起深刻的技术革命，而技术革命又必将把生产引向一个新的更高的水平。
    各位代表，一九六○年第一季度即将过去了。在这个时间内，我们的各项事业都取得了继续跃进的胜利。第一季度的工业总产值，预计比去年同期增长百分之八十。农业战线上的情况也很好，水利建设和积肥运动已经取得了很大的成就。基本建设的工作量，预计可以完成全年计划的百分之二十左右。这种胜利的形势，使广大群众的劳动热情愈来愈高涨，创造精神愈来愈发扬。当然，在胜利的前进中不会是没有困难的，目前有些省份出现了春旱现象，有些地区的运输比较紧张，这些都需要我们努力克服。帝国主义分子和敌特分子经常采取阴谋的手段，企图破坏我国的社会主义建设事业，也需要我们随时随地提高警惕。我们相信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大旗帜，依靠全国各族人民、各民主党派的共同努力，并且继续加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的经济协作，我们一定能够战胜任何困难，超额地完成一九六○年的国民经济计划，一定能够更加多快好省地继续大跃进！（附图片）
