    Immediately Restore the Freedom of Glezos!
    Commentator of this newspaper
    The Greek national hero Manolis Glezos is currently still detained in prison and suffering torture. Due to the strong protests of the Greek people and world public opinion, the Greek Supreme Court will re-examine the case of Glezos on March 12. All peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world are closely watching the upcoming trial in Athens.
    Glezos was arrested by the Greek reactionary authorities on December 5, 1958. The Greek military court fabricated charges such as "espionage" and "plotting a coup" to slander and persecute Glezos. During the interrogation of Glezos, although the "crimes" fabricated by the Greek authorities to frame Glezos were thoroughly and mercilessly exposed in the face of facts, and although the main "witness" for the prosecution finally had to admit that the Greek political police had no concrete evidence to prove that Glezos had committed "espionage," the Greek reactionary authorities still disregarded all this and arbitrarily sentenced Glezos to nine years of deprivation of freedom, eight years of deprivation of political rights, and other patriots to heavy sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment. Obviously, the Athens military court's trial and sentencing of Glezos and other Greek patriots were completely illegal and violated the basic principles of democracy and justice.
    It is well known that Glezos is an outstanding son of the Greek people. In order to strive for Greece's national independence and freedom, Glezos has persistently carried out heroic struggles against the reactionary forces. His heroic act of tearing down the Nazi flag from the castle of Athens during the Hitler occupation of Greece was praised and respected by people all over the world. After the war, Glezos continued to contribute all his wisdom and strength to defending the national interests of Greece and striving for democracy and peace. Therefore, the Greek reactionaries' persecution of Glezos cannot but be a blatant attack on the patriotic and democratic forces in Greece.
    The Greek government's intensification of fascist persecution internally is inseparable from its active affiliation with American imperialism and its pursuit of America's anti-peace Cold War policy externally. Because the Greek government has consistently followed the United States' policy of arms expansion and war preparation, the burden of military expenditure has become increasingly heavy, the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people's living standards have plummeted. According to recent Greek newspaper reports, the Greek government has agreed to the establishment of missile bases by the United States and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc on the island of Crete. As Glezos recently pointed out in his appeal published in the Greek "Dawn Daily," the Greek people know that the current situation in Greece is "mainly the result of the Cold War policy imposed on our country." The Greek ruling clique's adoption of despicable and shameless means to create the conspiracy to persecute Glezos is precisely to further suppress the Greek people's growing desire for peace, independence, democracy, and freedom, so that it can continue to implement the Cold War policy of American imperialism and turn Greece into a base for the Wall Street monopoly capital group to instigate war.
    However, the will of the Greek people cannot be suppressed by any reactionaries. After the news of the heavy sentences imposed on Glezos and other patriots spread, a massive movement to rescue Glezos was launched throughout Greece. The call for the release of Glezos and other patriots resounded throughout the cities and villages of Greece. The Greek people regard the struggle for the release of Glezos as a struggle to defend democratic rights and the cause of peace. The people of all countries and international organizations that uphold peace also strongly protest the Greek government's persecution of Glezos and other patriots. "Immediately release Glezos and other Greek patriots!" This is the common call of all honest people in the world. The Greek authorities must stop the persecution of Glezos and other patriots and immediately restore their freedom.

    立即恢复格列索斯的自由！
    本报评论员
    希腊的民族英雄格列索斯目前仍被拘禁在监狱中，备受折磨。由于希腊人民和世界公众的强烈抗议，希腊最高法院将于3月12日重新审理关于格列索斯的案件。全世界一切爱好和平与维护正义的人们正在密切地注视着日益临近的雅典的审判。
    格列索斯是在1958年12月5日被希腊反动当局逮捕的。希腊军事法庭以“间谍活动”、“策动政变”等莫须有的罪名，对格列索斯横加诬蔑和迫害。在对格列索斯进行审讯的过程中，尽管希腊当局捏造的陷害格列索斯的“罪名”在事实面前被彻底无情地揭穿了，也尽管原告的主要“证人”最后也不得不承认希腊政治警察局没有任何具体的证据足以证明格列索斯犯有“间谍罪”；但是希腊反动当局仍然不顾这一切，横蛮地判处格列索斯以剥夺自由九年，剥夺政治权利八年，以及判处其他爱国者五年以上直至无期徒刑的重刑。很显然，雅典军事法庭对格列索斯及其他希腊爱国者的审讯和判决完全是非法的，是违反起码的民主和正义原则的。
    人所共知，格列索斯是希腊人民的优秀儿子。为了争取希腊的民族独立和自由，格列索斯坚持不懈地同反动势力进行了英勇的斗争。他在希特勒占领希腊的期间奋不顾身地从雅典的城堡上撕下纳粹旗帜的英勇行为，受到全世界人民的称赞和尊敬。在战后，格列索斯继续为保卫希腊民族利益，争取民主与和平贡献出自己所有的智慧和力量。因此，希腊反动派对于格列索斯的迫害，不能不是对于希腊爱国民主力量的一次猖狂的进攻。
    希腊政府对内加紧法西斯迫害，是与它对外积极投靠美国帝国主义，追随美国反和平的冷战政策分不开的。由于希腊政府一贯追随美国的扩军备战政策，军费负担日益沉重，国民经济濒于破产，人民生活水平急剧下降。据最近希腊报纸报道，希腊政府已经同意美国和北大西洋侵略集团在克里特岛上建立导弹基地。正如格列索斯最近在希腊“黎明日报”发表的呼吁书所指出，希腊人民知道，目前希腊国内存在的这种状况，“主要是被强加在我国身上的冷战政策”的结果。希腊统治集团采取卑鄙无耻的手段制造迫害格列索斯的阴谋事件，就是为了进一步镇压希腊人民日益高涨的要求和平、独立、民主和自由的愿望，以便于它继续执行美国帝国主义的冷战政策，把希腊变成华尔街垄断资本集团策动战争的一个基地。
    但是，希腊人民的意志是任何反动派所镇压不了的。在格列索斯等爱国者被判处重刑的消息传出后，在希腊各地掀起了一个声势浩大的营救格列索斯的运动。要求释放格列索斯和其他爱国者的呼声响彻希腊的城市和乡村。希腊人民把争取释放格列索斯的斗争看作是保卫民主权利与和平事业的斗争。各国人民和维护和平的国际组织也强烈抗议希腊政府迫害格列索斯等爱国者的行为。“立即释放格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者！”这是全世界正直人民的共同呼声，希腊当局必须停止对格列索斯和其他爱国者的迫害，立即恢复他们的自由。
