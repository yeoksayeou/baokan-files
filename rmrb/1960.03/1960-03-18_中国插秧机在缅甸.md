Chinese Rice Transplanters in Burma

On March 7th, two rice transplanters donated by the Chinese government to Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win were demonstrated at the Maubin Model Farm in Burma. The working efficiency of the "Nanjing No. 105 Type B" rice transplanter was shown to be 25 to 30 times higher than manual labor. The working efficiency of the "Hunan Liling No. 2" rice transplanter was also very high. Prime Minister Ne Win and others who visited the demonstration were very satisfied with the working efficiency of the rice transplanters. (Attached picture)
