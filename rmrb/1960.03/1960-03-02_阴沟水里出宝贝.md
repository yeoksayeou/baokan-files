Treasures from the Gutter
	The Suzhou Creek in Shanghai is lined with factories on both sides. In the past, the large amount of wastewater and waste liquid produced by these factories during production flowed into the river through the sewers and was simply wasted.

	Now, workers at the Shanghai Rubber Waste Processing Factory transport large amounts of waste—wastewater and waste liquid—produced by pharmaceutical factories, chemical factories, copper factories, steel rolling mills, bicycle factories, and many other units to the factory. Using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, they refine the wastewater and waste liquid into large quantities of industrial raw materials urgently needed by the country, creating tens of thousands of yuan of wealth for the country every month. For example, sodium sulfate, a waste product of pharmaceutical factories, can be used in the glass and paper industries to replace caustic soda after being recycled. It can also be refined into high-grade reagents for use in dyes and medicine.

     阴沟水里出宝贝
    上海苏州河的两边都是工厂。过去，这些工厂在生产过程中产生的大量废水、废液，经过下水道流入小河，便白白流走了。
    现在，上海橡胶废品加工厂工人们把制药厂、化工厂、铜厂、轧钢厂、自行车厂等许多单位生产下来的大量下脚——废水、废液运到厂里来，采用土洋结合的办法，把废水、废液提炼成大量的国家迫切需要的工业原料，每月能为国家创造几十万元财富。例如，药厂下脚——硫酸钠，回收后，用于玻璃、造纸工业可代替烧碱，还可以从中提炼出高级试剂，作染料和药用。
