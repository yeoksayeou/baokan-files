Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 6th: According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Ministry of Power Station Construction has now initially formulated a long-term national electrification plan for the Soviet Union covering fifteen to twenty years.

According to this plan, by 1980, when the plan ends, the total power generation capacity of Soviet power stations will increase six to seven times, and the total power generation in 1975 and 1980 will approximately increase six and nine times respectively compared to last year. It is believed that with such a high rate of development, around 1975, or even between 1972 and 1973, the Soviet Union will be able to surpass the United States in terms of total electricity production and per capita production, ranking first in the world.

The Soviet Union's fifteen to twenty-year national electrification plan is an important component of the long-term plan for developing the national economy of the same period that the Soviet Union is currently formulating. The main task to be solved by this plan is to realize the task of comprehensive national electrification proposed by Lenin forty years ago. The plan stipulates that by 1980, the total power generation capacity of power stations across the Soviet Union will be increased to 480 million kilowatts, making the total power generation reach 900 billion kilowatt-hours in 1970, 1.5 trillion kilowatt-hours in 1975, and 2.3 trillion kilowatt-hours in 1980. In this way, the level of electrification of the entire national economy will be greatly improved, thereby accelerating the development of social productive forces. For example, by 1980, the power equipment used by each worker in the Soviet Union will increase approximately six times, and the average electricity consumption of each resident nationwide will increase seven times. All rural areas and the labor and daily life of farmers will be fully electrified. In terms of railway electrification, by 1970, the total length of electrified railways nationwide will be nearly three times longer than it is now, reaching 45,600 kilometers, which is more than 6,000 kilometers longer than the current total length of electrified railways in all of Europe.

The Soviet Union's fifteen to twenty-year national electrification plan is a plan to win time and accelerate surpassing the United States in terms of power development. This plan stipulates that in the twenty years up to 1980, the total power generation capacity of Soviet power stations will increase by 10% to 14.5% annually. In recent years, the United States has only increased by 1.5% to 2% annually. ?Polozhny, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Power Station Construction, pointed out in a conversation that judging from the Soviet Union's development plan and the growth rate of electricity production in the United States in the past eight years, around 1975, the Soviet Union will be able to catch up with the United States in terms of total electricity production. Moreover, this deadline is very likely to be brought forward. According to a recent editorial in the Soviet "Construction Newspaper," between 1972 and 1973, the Soviet Union will likely surpass the United States in terms of total electricity production and per capita production.

The Soviet Union's fifteen to twenty-year national electrification plan pays close attention to the correct combination of thermal power station and hydropower station construction, as well as the rational utilization of power resources in various regions. The plan stipulates that during this period, priority will continue to be given to developing thermal power stations with low investment and rapid construction, increasing the total power generation capacity of thermal power stations across the country by 8.5 times, reaching 380 million kilowatts by 1980. Among the thermal power stations planned to be built, giant power stations with a power generation capacity of 1.2 million to 2.4 million kilowatts will occupy an important position, and they will mainly be built in Siberia and the Kazakh Republic, which have inexhaustible coal resources.

At the same time, hydropower station construction will continue to be intensified. By 1980, the power generation capacity of hydropower stations across the country will increase eightfold. In this regard, the Soviet Union will make full use of the abundant hydropower resources in Siberia, such as the Yenisei River, the Ob River, and the Lena River. For example, during this period, a cascade of hydropower stations will be built on the Yenisei River. In addition to the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station with 6 million kilowatts currently under construction, three large hydropower stations, Yenisei, Sayan, and Osinov, will also be built. In addition, the Soviet Union will also build the unprecedentedly powerful Lower Lena Hydropower Station on the Lena River. The power generation capacity of this hydropower station will reach 20 million kilowatts, which is more than twice the total power generation capacity of the world's three largest hydropower stations – Bratsk, Stalingrad, and Kuibyshev.

By the end of the fifteen to twenty-year long-term plan, a powerful power station network will be densely distributed throughout the Soviet Union. All these power stations will be connected by high-voltage transmission lines, forming a unified power grid covering the entire country.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 6th: According to the Soviet "Construction Newspaper," the Soviet power industry is accelerating its progress. The results of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan – 1959 – show that the actual speed achieved in Soviet power industry construction is about 3% higher than the original target. Therefore, the original target of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for developing the power industry will definitely be overfulfilled.

The "Construction Newspaper" said that the original control figures of the Seven-Year Plan stipulated that the electricity output in 1965 would be 500 billion to 520 billion kilowatt-hours, while experts now predict that it will actually increase to 550 billion to 560 billion kilowatt-hours at that time. At the end of 1957, the Soviet Union proposed to increase electricity production to 900 billion kilowatt-hours by 1972. Now, due to the further acceleration of the development speed, this production target will be achieved two years earlier, in 1970.

The newspaper pointed out that the new power generation capacity has been put into production at a faster rate, ensuring the overfulfillment of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Power Development Plan. The newspaper said that at the beginning of the Seven-Year Plan, the total power generation capacity of power stations across the Soviet Union was 53 million kilowatts. The plan stipulated that another 60 million kilowatts of new power generation capacity would be added by 1965. However, since Soviet power station builders have accelerated the construction speed of power stations, it can already be predicted that the new power generation capacity added in these seven years will reach 66 million to 67 million kilowatts. In this way, by the end of 1965, the total power generation capacity of Soviet power stations can reach 119 million to 120 million kilowatts.

    大大提高国民经济电气化水平
    苏联初步制订电气化远景计划
    十五年左右电力总产量和按人口平均计算的产量将居世界第一位
    新华社莫斯科6日电　据苏联报纸报道：苏联电站建造部现在已经初步制订出了苏联十五年—二十年国家电气化远景计划。
    根据这个计划，到计划结束时的1980年，苏联发电站的总发电能力将增加六、七倍，发电总量在1975年和1980年差不多将分别增加为去年的六倍和九倍。据认为，按这样的高速度发展，在1975年前后，甚至在1972—1973年间，苏联就将可以在电力总产量和按人口平均计算的产量上超过美国，而居世界第一位。
    苏联十五年—二十年国家电气化计划，是目前苏联正在制订的同一时期发展国民经济远景计划的重要组成部分。这一计划所要解决的主要任务是，实现列宁在四十年前提出的全国全面电气化任务。计划规定，到1980年，要把苏联全国发电站的总发电能力增加到四亿八千万瓩，使发电总量在1970年达到九千亿度，1975年达到一万五千亿度，1980年达到二万三千亿度。这样，就将大大提高整个国民经济的电气化水平，从而加速社会生产力的发展。例如，到1980年，苏联每个工人的劳动中的动力装备程度大约将增加为六倍，全国每个居民的平均用电量将增加为七倍。全国所有农村和农民的劳动和日常生活都将全部电气化。在铁路电气化方面，到1970年，全国电气化铁路线就将比现在长将近三倍，达到四万五千六百公里，即比目前全欧洲的电气化铁路总长度还长六千多公里。
    苏联十五年—二十年国家电气化计划，是争取赢得时间、加速从动力发展水平上超过美国的计划。这一计划规定，在到1980年的二十年间，苏联发电站的总发电能力每年将增加10％到14．5％。而近些年来美国每年只增加1．5％到2％。苏联电站建造部副部长?波罗日尼在一次谈话中指出，从苏联的发展计划以及最近八年美国电力生产的增长速度来看，大约在1975年，苏联就可以在电力总产量上赶上美国。而且这个期限非常可能提前。据苏联“建筑报”最近在编辑部文章中指出，在1972—1973年间，苏联就将可能在电力总产量和按人口平均计算的产量上超过美国。
    苏联十五年—二十年国家电气化计划非常注意火电站和水电站建设的正确结合问题，以及合理利用各地的动力资源问题。计划规定，在这期间将继续优先发展投资少、建设快的火力发电站，使全国火电站的总发电能力增加八点五倍，到1980年达到三亿八千万瓩。在计划建设的这种发电站中，发电能力达一百二十万瓩到二百四十万瓩的巨型发电站将占重要地位，它们主要将建设在有着取之不竭的煤矿资源的西伯利亚和哈萨克共和国。
    和这同时，水电站建设仍将继续加紧进行。到1980年，全国水电站的发电能力将增加八倍，在这方面，苏联将充分利用西伯利亚丰富的水力资源，如叶尼塞河、鄂毕河、勒拿河等。例如，在这期间，将建成叶尼塞河上的水电站梯级。除了目前正在建筑的六百瓩的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站外，还将建设叶尼塞、萨扬和奥西诺夫等三个大水电站。此外，苏联还将在勒拿河上建设空前强大的下勒拿水电站。这个水电站的发电能力将达二千万瓩，比目前世界三大水电站——布拉次克、斯大林格勒和古比雪夫水电站的发电能力的总和还大一倍以上。
    到十五年—二十年远景计划结束时，一个强大的发电站网将密布苏联全国各地。所有这些发电站都将用高压输电线联接起来，形成一个包括全国的统一动力网。
    新华社莫斯科6日电　据苏联“建筑报”报道，苏联电力工业正加速前进。七年计划第一年——1959年的结果表明，苏联电力工业建设实际所达到的速度，要比原订指标高3％左右。因此，苏联发展电力工业的七年计划原订指标定将超额完成。
    “建筑报”说，七年计划控制数字原订1965年电力产量为五千亿度至五千二百亿度，而现在专家预计，那时候实际上将增加到五千五百亿度到五千六百亿度。1957年年底，苏联曾经提出要在1972年使电力产量增加到九千亿度，现在，由于发展速度进一步加快了，这一生产指标将提前两年而在1970年实现。
    这家报纸指出，新的发电能力以更快的速度投入生产，保证了苏联七年电力发展计划得以超额完成。报纸说，在七年计划开始时，苏联全国发电站的总发电能力为五千三百万瓩。计划规定，到1965年再增加六千万瓩的新发电能力。然而，由于目前苏联电站建设者加快了电站建设速度，已经可以预计，在这七年内增加的新发电能力将达六千六百万瓩至六千七百万瓩。这样，到1965年年底，苏联发电站的总发电能力将可以达到一亿一千九百万瓩到一亿二千万瓩。
