Spring Breeze Blows Across the Land, A High Tide of Plowing and Preparation Arises

Zhejiang: Linked Competitions Strive for the Top
This newspaper reports that Zhejiang's plowing and preparation competition is in full swing.
Throughout the province, inter-prefecture, inter-county, inter-commune, and inter-team linked competitions have been launched everywhere. Everyone is focusing on plowing and preparation, vowing to win advancement. Comparing, learning, catching up, and helping are taking place everywhere, all striving for the top. In the neat and wide rice seedling fields spread across the province, the prelude to the high tide of spring plowing production has already begun.
The Hangjiahu Plain area in northern Zhejiang, under the slogan of "Northern Zhejiang surpassing Southern Zhejiang, striving for the top in plowing and preparation," has launched interlinked competitions, determined to compete with Wenzhou area in southern Zhejiang, where the season comes earlier. Currently, over 37% of the early rice fields have been tilled, the fastest progress in the province, and the quality is better than last year.
After the Wenzhou Prefecture in southern Zhejiang and the Jiaxing Prefecture launched interlinked competitions, the CPC Wenzhou Prefectural Committee immediately sent a delegation to Jiaxing to "learn from experience" and specially convened four conferences on agriculture, finance and trade, industry and transportation, and animal husbandry. At the meetings, pace-setters from all counties jointly launched four initiatives to carry out the plowing and preparation competition, immediately sparking a mass competition upsurge throughout the prefecture. In order to strengthen the frontline leadership of plowing and preparation production, the Wenzhou Prefectural Committee and county committees at all levels have transferred more than four thousand county and commune cadres, assigning responsibilities, implementing them at all levels, and leading the competition and inspecting the preparation. Under the slogan of "Breaking through the scientific barrier of seeds, marching towards thousands of grains per ear, ten thousand grains per jin, and ten thousand jin per mu," the vast commune members of this prefecture are enthusiastically carrying out competitions, everyone carefully selecting good seeds, every plot sowing good seeds, and every commune establishing good seed breeding farms. After more than one hundred communes and seven thousand production teams in the Jinhua Prefecture launched interlinked competitions, more than 600,000 commune members held a pledge rally. Everyone was full of energy, and the progress of plowing, fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer transportation, mountain management, water management, and soil management was greatly accelerated.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei: Accumulating Fertilizer, Delivering Fertilizer, Sowing Seeds, and Raising Seedlings
From both sides of the Yangtze River to the mountainous areas of western Hubei, from the Jianghan Plain to the hilly lake areas, everywhere is a busy scene of plowing and preparing fields, storing water, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, sowing seeds, and raising seedlings.
This year, from the very beginning of spring plowing production, an unusual situation has emerged. Whether it is accumulating fertilizer, repairing farm tools, drying seeds, raising draught cattle, tilling land, or preparing seedling fields, everything is about a month earlier than in previous years, and the progress is fast and the quality is good. To date, more than 7 billion dan of natural fertilizer and miscellaneous fertilizer have been accumulated throughout the province, and most of the base fertilizer needed for spring-sown crops has been prepared. Most of the more than 20 million mu of winter fallow land in the province has been tilled once or twice.
In spring plowing production, the tool reform movement is flourishing. Xiangyang Prefecture has promoted more than fifty kinds of standardized advanced transportation tools. Sui County, Zaoyang, Guanghua, and other six counties have all achieved an average of one vehicle per two laborers, basically realizing vehicular transportation. Jingzhou, Wuhan, Huanggang, and other lakeside areas are also vigorously developing wooden boat transportation according to local conditions. Enshi, Yidu, and other places are vigorously developing sliding wire rope transportation according to the characteristics of mountainous areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin. Heilongjiang: Sowing Plans Implemented to the Team
Under the guidance of the principle of "Taking Grain as the Key Link and Achieving Overall Leap Forward," the people's communes in Heilongjiang Province have fully prepared for spring plowing.
In order to meet the needs of the sugar refining, flax textile, and other industrial developments, this year, the sown area of ​​various cash crops in Heilongjiang Province has increased significantly. Among them, the sown area of ​​sugar beets will increase by 30% compared with last year, and flax will increase by 45,000 mu compared with last year. The sown area of ​​flue-cured tobacco, hemp, blue hemp, medicinal materials, and small oil crops has increased compared with last year. While the production plans for grain crops have been implemented in various places, the production plans for cash crops have also been implemented to the management areas and production teams. Most of the flax and sugar beets have been allocated to specific plots.
As early as last autumn when the land was plowed, the plots for planting cash crops were deeply plowed by about eight inches. Some people's communes also dug machine wells and earthen wells in these fields. Flax and sugar beet seeds have been basically prepared.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. Jilin: Fight Drought, Conserve Moisture, and Sow Early
Spring sowing preparation work in Jilin has been done early, quickly, and well. Many areas have broken the conventional wisdom of "Busy sowing wheat during Qingming, and sowing large fields during Guyu" and began sowing spring wheat and oil crops such as sunflowers and castor seeds in early February. By late February, 150,000 mu of spring wheat and oil crops had been sown throughout the province.
Since last winter, the vast commune members in Jilin Province have started preparing for spring sowing. To date, the province's 130 million tons of fertilizer accumulation plan has been overfulfilled ahead of schedule. While continuing to accumulate and produce high-quality and quick-acting fertilizers for topdressing, the focus is on concentrating efforts to transport fertilizer to the fields. More than 60% of the manure fertilizer has been delivered to the fields. Soil improvement has completed 63% of the original plan, totaling 3.8 million mu. This year, the area of ​​various improved crop varieties will reach about 90%. In order to fight drought, conserve moisture, and ensure timely early sowing, land preparation work has also started about half a month earlier than in previous years.
The hundreds of thousands of mu of autumn wasteland reclaimed last autumn will all be sown this year. A vigorous mass movement to create high-yield fields has also been launched. The high-yield fields planned in various places generally account for about 30% of the sown area, more than double that of 1959.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. Liaoning: Carefully Selected Good Seeds, Sufficient Good Seeds Prepared
Liaoning Province has now carefully selected about 600 million jin of various crop seeds, accounting for more than 50% of the amount needed for sowing. The germination rate of carefully selected seeds generally reaches more than 95%.
Achieving the improvement of crop varieties is one of the main measures taken by Liaoning Province this year to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production. At present, except for wheat, peanuts, and hemp, where seeds are still insufficient due to the expansion of the sown area, the seeds of other field crops have basically been prepared. In order to resolutely ensure that seeds are selected well and kept in sufficient quantities, and achieve dryness, cleanliness, purity, and plumpness, the people's communes in various places, according to the instructions of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, have launched a mass movement of one selection (careful selection) and three inspections (inspecting quantity, quality, and variety) with the commune's breeding farm as the core during the preparation.
The people's communes in various places have properly arranged labor, established professional seed selection organizations, and fully mobilized women and semi-laborers to participate in seed selection work. Many areas have also organized major inspections and major evaluations to ensure the quality of seed selection work and resolutely prevent inferior seeds from being planted.

    浙江湖北黑龙江吉林辽宁集中力量突击备耕
    春风吹大地　备耕浪潮高
    浙江：挂钩竞赛齐争上游
    本报讯　浙江备耕竞赛热火朝天。
    全省到处展开专区与专区、县与县、社与社、队与队相互挂钩竞赛，人人狠抓备耕，誓夺先进，处处比、学、赶、帮，齐争上游。遍布全省农村的整齐而宽阔的各式秧田里，全省春耕生产大高潮的序幕已经揭开。
    地处浙江北部的杭嘉湖平原地区在“浙北超浙南、备耕争上游”的口号下，相互展开挂钩竞赛，决心和季节较早的浙南温州地区大赛一场。现在早稻田37％以上已经翻耕好，进度为全省最快，质量也比去年好。
    浙南的温州专区和嘉兴专区挂钩竞赛后，中共温州地委立即派出了代表团到嘉兴“取经”，并专门召开了农业、财贸、工业交通、畜牧四个会议，由各县这四方面的标兵联合发起开展备耕竞赛的四大倡议，全专区立即掀起了群众性的竞赛热潮。为了加强备耕生产的第一线领导，温州地委和各县县委共抽调了四千多名县、社干部，分工包干，层层落实，一抓到底，深入领导竞赛，检查备耕。在“突破种子科学关、向千粒穗、万粒斤、万斤田进军”的口号下，这个专区广大社员热烈开展竞赛，人人粒选良种，丘丘播种良种，社社建立良种繁育场。金华专区一百多个公社、七千多个生产队相互挂钩竞赛后，六十多万社员举行了誓师大会，个个干劲十足，耕田、积肥、运肥、治山、治水、治土等生产进度大大加快。
    湖北：积肥送肥播种育秧
    新华社武汉讯　湖北省从长江两岸到鄂西山区，从江汉平原到丘陵湖区，到处都是一片犁田整地、蓄水保水、积肥送肥、播种育秧的繁忙景象。
    今年各地春耕生产一开始，就出现了不寻常的局面。无论积肥、整修农具、翻晒种籽、饲养耕牛，翻耕土地还是整理秧田，都比往年提早了一个月左右，而且进度快，质量好。到目前止，全省已积下自然肥料、杂肥七十多亿担，春播作物所需的底肥已大部备足。全省二千多万亩冬闲田大部分都耕整一遍到两遍。
    在春耕生产中，工具改革运动蓬勃地开展起来。襄阳专区推广各种定型的先进运输工具达五十多种。随县、枣阳、光化等六县都已作到平均两个劳动力有一辆车子，基本上实现了运输车子化。荆州、武汉、黄冈等滨湖地区，还因地制宜大搞木船运输。恩施、宜都等地则根据山区特点，大搞滑丝滑道运输。
    黑龙江：播种计划落实到队
    新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江省各人民公社在“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，充分进行了春耕准备工作。
    为了满足制糖、亚麻纺织等工业发展的需要，今年，黑龙江省各种经济作物的播种面积又有很大增加。其中，甜菜播种面积将比去年增加30％，亚麻将比去年增加四万五千亩。烤烟、大麻、青麻、药材以及小油料作物的播种面积，都比去年增加。各地在粮食作物生产计划落实的同时，经济作物生产计划也都落实到管理区、生产队，亚麻、甜菜等大部分已落实到地块。
    早在去年秋翻地时，各地就给种经济作物的地块深翻八寸左右，有些人民公社还在这些地里打了机井和土井。亚麻、甜菜种子已基本准备齐全。
    吉林：抗旱保墒适时早种
    新华社长春讯　吉林各地春播准备工作搞得又早又快又好，很多地区破除了“清明忙种麦，谷雨种大田”的常规，在2月上旬就开始播种春小麦和向日葵、蓖麻子等油料作物，2月下旬全省已种春麦和油料作物十五万亩。
    吉林省广大人民公社社员从去冬以来就着手进行春播准备。到目前止，全省一亿三千万吨的积肥计划已经提前超额完成，各地在继续积制优质速效肥料准备用作追肥的同时，正在集中力量往地里突击运肥，现在已有60％以上的粪肥送到了地里。土壤改良已完成原订计划63％，共达三百八十万亩。今年各种作物良种面积将达90％左右。为了抗旱保墒，保证适时早种，整地工作也比往年提早半个月左右开始。
    去秋开垦的几十万亩秋荒，今年都准备播种。一个轰轰烈烈的大搞丰产田运动也已开展起来。各地规划的丰产田一般都占播种面积30％左右，比1959年增加一倍还多。
    辽宁：精选良种备足良种
    新华社沈阳讯　辽宁省目前已经精选出各种作物良种六亿斤左右，占播种需要量50％以上，精选后的种子发芽率一般达到95％以上。
    实现作物良种化，是今年辽宁省保证农业生产继续跃进的主要措施之一。目前全省除了小麦、花生、大麻因为播种面积扩大种子尚感不足以外，其他大田作物的种子都已基本备足。为了坚决做到种子选好留足，达到干、净、纯、饱，各地人民公社根据中共辽宁省委和省人民委员会的指示，在备耕中以公社的繁育场为核心，普遍展开了一选（精选）三查（查数量、质量、品种）的群众性运动。
    各地人民公社都妥善安排劳动力，建立专业选种组织，充分发动妇女和半劳动力参加选种工作。许多地区还组织大检查、大评比，保证选种工作的质量，坚决控制不让劣种下地。
