    People's Commune Opens the Door to Science
    -- Introducing the Scientific Research Activities of Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian, Shandong
    Liu Peiren, Fang Jiawen, Li Jianlin, Yang Shixin
    Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, has a large population and little land, with an average of only 1.6 mu of land per person. Before liberation, the per-mu yield of grain was only 200 jin, and the annual grain production was not enough to eat for half a year. As a result, a large number of people migrated out, with one-third going elsewhere to make a living; more than 2 million jin of grain were shipped across the sea from the Northeast every year. After liberation, grain production increased year by year, and by 1957, the year before communization, the per-mu yield had reached 440 jin, which not only solved the problem of food rations but also sold 7.9 million jin of surplus grain to the state. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the per-mu yield soared to 621 jin, exceeding the grain target set by the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule. In 1959, the first year after communization, the growth rate was even more astonishing, with an average per-mu yield of over 850 jin on the commune's 63,000 mu of land, an increase of 37% over the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.
    The rapid development of production here is primarily the result of the continuous revolution in production relations, and it is also the result of continuous innovation in science and technology. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, especially the establishment of the people's commune, has opened up a new situation for the widespread adoption of new technologies, and the widespread adoption of new technologies has greatly accelerated the development of production.

    From Two Technical Groups to Universal Science
    The mutual aid and cooperation movement of the people of Xiyou has a history of ten years. The people here also began to adopt new technologies ten years ago, after the establishment of mutual aid groups. Although the mutual aid groups at that time adopted some new technologies, they could not carry out scientific research due to their small size and limited strength. After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in 1953, the first technical group was established under the advocacy of the Party General Branch Secretary of the Wangjia Agricultural Cooperative to study, experiment with, and promote new technologies. Subsequently, the Houlu Agricultural Cooperative also established a technical group of the same nature. This was the bud of local farmers' scientific research. As soon as this bud was born, it received the attention of the Party organization and the cooperative committee. The Party General Branch of the agricultural cooperative supported the activities of the technical group in all aspects and encouraged them to break through all difficulties and fight against the backward habits. At that time, many cooperative members did not understand the role of the technical group. When they saw them often running to the experimental fields for observation, some people sarcastically said that they were "loafing on the job," wasting manpower and damaging the land. When the young woman Zhang Huanying was carrying out variety breeding in the field, some people deliberately raised many questions to make things difficult for her. Because the experiment had not yet yielded results, Zhang Huanying had to answer, "This question needs further study." Some people who liked to make sarcastic remarks called her "Research, research" when they met. Although the youth of the technical group were constantly subjected to sarcasm and ridicule, they were not overwhelmed by these cold words because they received the attention and support of the Party organization. In the second year of the establishment of the technical group, they bought the "Yanda 811" millet improved variety from other places and densely planted seven parts of the experimental field, with 42,000 plants per mu, twice as dense as the local millet. After seedling setting, the old farmer Zhang Yuancai said, "You can't open your eyes when you walk into the field. When you see it so dense, you get upset. Don't look at the good seedlings, they can't show ears." Later, when the ears showed, he stubbornly said, "Showing ears can't bear grains." When the millet matured, the cooperative members went to harvest it. Zhang Yuancai still thought that nothing could be harvested and was unwilling to go. Everyone pushed him to go. He didn't even look at it, just shook his head and sighed. As a result, when they threshed it and weighed it, each mu yielded 823 jin, more than twice as high as the local average yield. Only then did Zhang Yuancai say, "I, an old man, am convinced by the improved variety and dense planting." The technical group grew up in constant struggle under the leadership of the Party in this way. However, it was after communization that science and technology were truly popularized throughout the township and accepted by the masses.

    In August 1958, all twenty advanced cooperatives in the township merged to form a people's commune. The establishment of the people's commune and the great leap in production more urgently required the widespread adoption of new technologies; at the same time, the communization movement also created favorable conditions and opened up broad roads for carrying out mass scientific research, promoting new technologies, and training technical personnel. As soon as the commune was established, under the leadership of the commune Party committee and the specific guidance of Xu Jianchun, a member of the Party committee and director of the commune, it quickly established its own scientific and technical team: the commune established a Scientific and Technical Committee, an Agricultural Technology Station, a Red and Expert School, as well as a Tractor Station, a Meteorological Station, and an Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station, etc.; all major teams established Youth Technology Teams, Agricultural Machinery Teams, and Old Peasant Advisory Committees; each small team was equipped with technicians, and some even established technical groups, forming a systematic scientific and technical network from top to bottom. This mass scientific and technical team is a powerful force for the technical revolution and has laid a good foundation for agricultural scientific research.

    From Simple Experiments to Complex Research
    After communization, scientific research activities not only spread from a dozen people in two technical groups to the entire commune, but also broadened the content of technical innovation and the field of scientific research, and explored the problems more deeply. If in the past, when the per-mu yield was 180 jin or several hundred jin, the inherent experience could solve the problem, then today, to yield 1,000 jin per mu or even higher, the problem cannot be solved without higher science and technology. The scientific research of the Xiyou People's Commune is precisely advancing along the road of deepening step by step, improving step by step, from small to large, and from elementary to advanced according to this new need. Before communization, the two technical groups only planted a few mu of experimental fields and conducted some simple comparative tests in several major aspects such as water, fertilizer, soil, density, and seeds. Now the commune and the production brigade have taken out more than 500 mu of land for the Red and Expert School and the Youth Technology Team to use as experimental fields and demonstration fields, and have added the necessary scientific research instruments and equipment for them, including greenhouses, microscopes, specimen rooms, etc. The scale of scientific research is larger, there are more projects, and it is more systematic and complete. According to the needs of production, with the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture as the central content, they study the growth laws of various crops under various soil, climate, and other natural conditions; study the water and fertilizer needed by various crops; study the advantages and disadvantages of various varieties and cultivate new varieties; study methods to prevent wheat lodging and prevent and control various diseases and insect pests, as well as various technologies such as cultivation and dense planting; study the feeding, management, breeding, and epidemic prevention of livestock; and keep detailed records of daily climate changes. At present, they have 82 experimental projects. The experimental methods are also becoming more and more diverse and complex. In the 1959 wheat experiment, the Red and Expert School alone divided more than 300 experimental plots and conducted several experiments and dozens of treatments on each character of the "Eight-Character Constitution." The experimental design is also more scientific. Detailed records are kept of field observations, and archives are established, which greatly improves the accuracy of the experiment. In the experiment, they also cited some of the most advanced scientific achievements in agricultural scientific research. For example, in cooperation with the Physics Institute of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, they conducted experiments on treating corn seeds with the isotope Cobalt-60 and treating wheat seeds with X-rays; in cooperation with Andong Pharmaceutical Factory, they conducted effect experiments on the plant growth stimulants – sodium naphthylacetate and sodium naphthoxyacetate. In one year, the Red and Expert School successfully trial-produced nine kinds of bacterial fertilizers and three kinds of pesticides, of which azobacterin, silicate bacterial fertilizer, rhizobium fertilizer, and phosphorus bacterial fertilizer have been produced in large quantities. In addition to meeting the needs of the commune, they have also signed a sales contract with the county commercial bureau to promote them in large quantities.

    In addition to the Red and Expert School and the Youth Technology Team carrying out large-scale experiments, various production teams also carried out many experiments in the fields in combination with farming. This widespread experimental activity has greatly accelerated the process of popularizing science. For example, if an experiment is successful in one unit, it is not dared to be promoted, but if it is carried out in several units at the same time and a common conclusion is reached, it can be promoted with certainty. Therefore, it not only strengthens the leadership's determination to promote new technologies, but also makes it easier for the masses to accept.

    Grasp the Key and Open the Key
    Starting from actual needs and solving the urgent problems in production is an important principle that the Party organization has stipulated for scientific research work. When wheat was infested with the Valley Longimandibula, the insecticide 666 was sprayed several times without effect. Under the guidance of the Party organization, Zhang Baoji, the head of the technical group, and the technicians observed in the field day and night and finally discovered the activity pattern of this insect pest and found the reason why the medicine was ineffective. It turned out that this pest only came out to move after 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning when the temperature reached 24 degrees Celsius, and after 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when the temperature dropped, it hid in the ground and did not come out. Its activity range was in the second and third sections of the wheat stalk. According to this discovery, the commune instructed each production team to change the time and method of spraying, and the Valley Longimandibula was quickly eliminated. Under the leadership of the Party, the technical group and the technical team carefully observed and painstakingly studied, and completely mastered the habits and control methods of more than 30 kinds of insect pests in the area. The borer, which had caused great damage to corn for many years, was completely eliminated in 1959 by the successful trial of poisonous sand medicine. Improved varieties are an important key to increasing production, and the Party organization and the commune committee entrusted the task of collecting, testing, and cultivating improved varieties to the technical team and the technical group. In the past few years, they have collected a large number of varieties for testing. The Houlu technical team alone has collected 274 varieties of wheat and 32 varieties of corn and established a "primitive variety garden." The Wangjia technical team alone has successfully cultivated five new varieties of corn, and there are still 149 wheat hybrid combinations that are being separated. After many repeated comparative tests, the Red and Expert School and the Houlu, Wangjia, and Zhufeng technical teams reached a common conclusion: among corn varieties, "Andong Mayya No. 11," "Golden Queen," and "Huangxian Ermaya" have the highest yield in the local area, and among wheat varieties, "Qianjiao," "Zaoyang," "Bima No. 4," and "Youzimai" have the highest yield. These varieties have a yield increase of at least 15% and up to 30% higher than local varieties. Now these varieties are commonly used throughout the commune, and all have achieved improved varieties. After implementing dense planting of crops, the problems of ventilation, light transmission, and prevention of lodging were quickly put on the agenda of scientific research. Now they have researched some very good methods. For example, the issue of leaving double seedlings of corn after dense planting, some people say it increases production, and some people say it reduces production. The test results of the technical team proved that at 4,000 plants per mu, single plants increased production by 16.5% compared with double plants; at 4,500 to 5,000 plants per mu, double plants increased production by 4.8% to 11.1% compared with single plants; at 7,000 plants per mu, there was no difference between single and double plants. According to their observation and research, when corn is below 4,000 plants, the density is not very high, and single plants are left, the distribution of plants is uniform, which is conducive to the development of the root system. If double plants are left, they will shade each other, affecting growth. However, above 4,000 plants, as the density increases, the adverse effects of ventilation and light transmission in the field will increase. Leaving double plants can increase the row spacing and improve ventilation and light transmission. At 7,000 plants, because the plant spacing is very small, single and double plants are difficult to distinguish, so there is no difference in yield. The technical team conducted such practical experiments and scientific analysis, convincingly answering the various questions that people encounter in production.

            Comprehensive Innovation and Universal Promotion
    The combination of new science and technology and the powerful force of the commune's organization of production has produced endless power. In just one year, many major reforms have been carried out in the farming system and farming technology. In the past, the vast majority of crops here were two crops in two years, and the land with one crop in two years accounted for only 50% of the cultivated land in 1957. In the first year after communization, it increased to more than 85%. According to the 1959 yield calculation, one crop in two years can harvest 303 jin of wheat and 600 jin of corn per mu, totaling 903 jin; if calculated according to two crops in three years, each mu yields 500 jin of millet, 150 jin of soybeans, and 303 jin of wheat, totaling 953 jin. The yield in two years is only 50 jin more than the yield in one year. While changing two crops in three years to one crop in two years, the area of intercropping and relay cropping was also expanded. Now, in addition to wheat, almost no single crop can be seen in the entire commune. Even cabbage and radish fields are relay-cropped with wheat. It is truly "no land is idle, and the four seasons are evergreen." The change in cultivation methods is even more prominent, completely changing the habits of shallow plowing, sparse planting, and extensive management. Taking the wheat planted in the autumn of 1959 as an example, in addition to the higher levels of the 10,000-mu high-yield area of the commune, the 1,000-mu high-yield area of the brigade, and the 100-mu high-yield area of the team, almost all 40,000 mu of ordinary wheat fields in the entire commune were of one specification: deep plowing of six to eight inches, fertilization of 6,000 to 8,000 jin, sowing of 25 to 30 jin, and sowing period was between the autumnal equinox and the cold dew period, and the entire area was completely transformed into large ridge fields. After planting the wheat, the cooperative members happily said, "The wheat planted now is neither too early nor too late, neither too deep nor too shallow, neither too sparse nor too dense, and the specifications are consistent. The three types of seedlings are eliminated from the womb. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and without the strength of the people's commune, this would never be possible." Taking corn management as another example, in the past, fertilizer was generally applied once, and water was watered only when there was a drought. Now, it has been changed to applying fertilizer in stages and watering in stages, generally applying fertilizer twice and watering four times. In the past, thinning seedlings was generally done by children, but now it is done by people with higher skills to achieve vigorous and even seedlings, which is conducive to ventilation, light transmission, and full pollination; in the past, weeding was generally done once, but now it is generally done two or three times. In the past, diseases and insect pests were mostly treated after they occurred, but now prevention is used instead of treatment.

    The change in farming methods has provided new topics for tool reform. The promotion of each new technology requires corresponding production tools. For example, dense planting requires a dense planting drill, and deep plowing requires a deep plowing plow. During the autumn sowing in 1958, the eight-inch-wide small foot drills were all changed to six-inch-wide large foot drills, and in 1959, 327 deep plowing plows were created. In order to quickly promote ridge fields, the Houdeng technical team created a ridge-making tool that was attached to the back of a horse-drawn seeder, completing sowing and ridge-making in one go, eliminating the need for a special ridge-making process. When drilling machine wells in the winter of 1958, machine well drills could not be bought. The commune-run machinery factory used scrap iron the size of horseshoes to hammer out 26 machine well drills weighing 280 jin overnight, ensuring the completion of the well-drilling task. When controlling insects in 1959, 40 large sprayers were rushed out to support the insect control work. In the year after communization, the entire commune created and imitated 12,067 new-style tools, including 100 corn threshers and 150 sweet potato slicers. The reform of tools has improved labor productivity and saved a lot of labor, creating favorable conditions for further reforming farming methods.

        Commune's General Staff Department, Masses' Inquiry Office
    In carrying out scientific research and promoting new technologies, the Youth Technology Team and the Red and Expert School are two very good forms and are also the most active forces in the technical revolution. The commune Party committee and the general branches of the major teams firmly grasp these two forms as their technical general staff department for conducting scientific and technological experiments and promotion. The Red and Expert School is a new type of agricultural technical school, which is different from ordinary agricultural schools. Its learning method is intermittent, one day of learning and one day of labor, combining theory with practice and integrating learning with application. In order to adapt to this teaching method, the commune allocated 129 mu of land to them, and the school itself established a bacterial fertilizer factory, a livestock farm, an orchard nursery, etc., as places for creating high yields, conducting experiments, and labor practice. Therefore, it is not only a school for training technical personnel, but also a position for conducting scientific research, and also a technical general staff department of the commune. The school has a total of 106 students, all graduates of senior primary schools under the age of 17. Their lives completely depend on the school's production income and implement a supply system. Their schooling system is three years. For a 15- or 16-year-old senior primary school graduate, three years of study and labor is actually a preparation process for formally participating in labor. After they graduate, they grow taller, their labor skills improve, and they have a certain level of scientific and technical expertise, which can become a new type of farmer. In order to solve the urgent needs of production, the Red and Expert School also trained 124 technical personnel of various types for various production teams in one year. With the large increase in agricultural machinery, they also ran short-term training courses and trained three batches of mechanics, totaling more than 170 people.

    The Youth Technology Team is a unit directly under the leadership of the production brigade, generally with a dozen people, cultivating 20 to 30 mu of land. Their regular tasks are: learning, experimenting, and promoting new technologies; creating high-yield and high-yield, and establishing pacesetters for the entire team; assisting the brigade in formulating technical management measures, and being responsible for the technical guidance of the large-scale high-yield areas of each team. This is a technical dissemination team. Although their learning is not as systematic as that of the Red and Expert School and the learning time is not so long, it is also a position for cultivating a large number of technical personnel through actual experiments and production labor. They conduct experimental research on key issues in production, set an example for the production team, and are widely welcomed by the cooperative members. When the cooperative members encounter any difficult problems to solve, they run to the Youth Technology Team for help. The commune Party committee and the Party general branches of the major teams also constantly hold on-site meetings in the Red and Expert School and various Youth Technology Teams to disseminate their new technologies and advanced experiences. The cooperative members happily said, "If you don't know how to farm, ask the technical team; if you want a high yield, study at the 'Red and Expert' (school)."

      Science Arms the Masses, the Masses Fall in Love with Science
    Mass scientific research has begun to combine physical labor and mental labor in agricultural production, and a new generation of people who can labor, have knowledge, and have a communist style is growing rapidly. As Deputy Director Zhang Yongmao said, "Airplanes and artillery are not born, but are researched step by step by people. If others can do it, why can't we?" They are attacking the scientific fortress with such great ambitions. Zhang Yongmao was originally an ordinary farmer. After several years of painstaking research, he created many new-style agricultural tools such as machine grinders, feed crushers, and corn planters, and became a technical innovation expert. He has also conducted many effective researches and experiments in crop cultivation and management. Now he is a part-time researcher at the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Xu Jianmin, the leader of the Houlu technical team, is a breeding expert. In order to cultivate new varieties, he and his team members traveled around to collect improved varieties. At the same time, he also learned to use the breeding methods of plant sexual hybridization and asexual hybridization, and learned the advanced breeding method of corn self-crossing line double-crossing species, and carried out 63 combinations. Wang Keying, the young female director of the pig farm, learned the complete set of pig farming techniques of feeding, management, breeding, and epidemic prevention three years after graduating from senior primary school. Because her skills in treating pigs are very high, the cooperative members call her "Pig Doctor." Outstanding figures in all aspects are emerging one after another. Now there are 554 technicians, mechanics, and veterinarians in the entire commune. This kind of new talent in agricultural technology will become more and more numerous and stronger with the growth of the people's commune.

    The huge role of agricultural science and technology in production has greatly liberated people's thinking and opened up people's minds. In the past, the introduction of any new technology, the reform of new tools, and the formulation of new systems were always resisted by conservative ideas. Some people always like to use the words "the old generation has never seen it" and "the old generation has never done it this way" to oppose the promotion of new technologies. But now, due to the widespread use of new technologies, the cooperative members have recognized the benefits of science and technology from personal experience and have become interested in science. "Talking about science, learning science, and using science" has become the focus of public opinion. "Experiment, experiment" and "research, research" have become people's catchphrases. It has become a common trend for teams to conduct experiments and for everyone to learn science. From the secretary of the commune Party committee to the ordinary cooperative members, they have all participated in scientific research work. Li Zuokun, an old cooperative member who is nearly 70 years old, also conducted experiments on preventing and controlling millet white hair disease and sorghum black spike disease. During the wheat harvest in 1959, 400 primary school students participated in the field selection of seeds and the collection of "variant spikes," and collected 17 kinds of "variant spikes" with cultivation and experimental value. The idea of mystifying science has been broken. The cooperative members said, "If you can grow more grain, you have science." At the same time, the continuous appearance of large-scale high-yield fields is also an impact on the idea of "reaching the top of production increase." In 1959, the 129 mu of experimental fields planted by the Red and Expert School averaged 1,632 jin per mu, twice as high as the yield of the large fields of the general production teams. This fact eloquently tells people that the land still has great potential. The cooperative members said, "When we look at the land we grow, we feel it's pretty good, but when we compare it with the 'Red and Expert,' we have to work harder to catch up."

      Great Development of Science and Technology, Nothing the Commune Can't Do
    The facts of running science in the commune in the past year have proved that the development of science is so rapid and the achievements of technical innovation are so great that it would be difficult to do without the people's commune. In the past, agricultural cooperatives had few households, a small scale, and weak strength, and it was impossible to take out so much manpower and land to specialize in scientific and technological research. At the same time, due to the limitations of the organization scale and scope of activities of small cooperatives, new technologies were not easy to fully promote. After communization, the integration of government and commune meant that the original advanced cooperatives became the production brigades of the commune, which could carry out production according to the commune's unified plan and implement unified technical specifications. At the same time, the "large-scale and public ownership" people's commune also has full conditions to adopt new science and technology and carry out large-scale technical reforms. For example, to change two crops in three years to one crop in two years and increase one season of crops requires sufficient labor. In the past, many agricultural cooperatives could not carry out this reform, which was largely due to the small size and insufficient labor. However, after communization, because labor can be arranged in a larger scope, labor potential has been tapped; because many welfare undertakings (nurseries, canteens, sewing groups, etc.) have been held, more than 6,000 female laborers have been liberated; due to the development of agricultural machinery (8 new tractors, 67 gas engines and boiler engines, 8 threshers, 1 combine harvester, and 1 car have been added), labor efficiency has been greatly improved, which has made it possible to carry out this reform with sufficient conditions. At the same time, the vigorous development of commune-run industry has also created good conditions for tool reform.

    The people's commune has opened the door to science and paved the way for mass scientific research. The members of the Xiyou People's Commune are striding forward along this broad road!

    人民公社打开了科学大门
    ——介绍山东掖县西由人民公社的科学研究活动
    刘培仁　方家文　李建林　杨世欣
    山东省掖县西由人民公社人多地少，平均每人只有一亩六分地。解放前，粮食亩产量只有二百斤，每年的粮食不足半年食用。因此，人口大量外流，有三分之一出外谋生；每年从东北越海运来粮食二百余万斤。解放后，粮食产量逐年增加，到公社化前一年——1957年，亩产量已达到四百四十斤，不仅解决了口粮问题，而且还向国家出售七百九十万斤余粮。大跃进的1958年，亩产量跃增到六百二十一斤，提前九年超额完成了全国农业发展纲要所规定的粮食指标。公社化后的第一年——1959年，增长速度更为惊人，全社六万三千亩土地，平均亩产八百五十斤以上，比特大跃进的1958年又增长了37％。
    这里生产发展如此迅速，首先是生产关系方面不断革命的结果，同时，也是科学技术方面不断革新的结果。互助合作运动的发展，特别是人民公社的建立，为广泛采用新技术打开了新的局面，而新技术的广泛采用又大大地加速了生产的发展。
    从两个技术组到全民办科学
    西由人民的互助合作运动，已经有十年的历史了。这里的人们采用新技术也是在十年前建立了互助组以后才开始的。当时的互助组虽然采用了一些新技术，但由于人少力薄，就不能进行科学研究。到1953年成立了农业生产合作社以后，在王贾农业社党总支书记的倡导下，建立了第一个技术组，进行新技术的学习、试验和推广。随后，后吕农业社也成立了同样性质的技术组。这是当地农民进行科学研究的萌芽。这个萌芽一出生，就受到党组织和社委会的重视。农业社的党总支从各方面支持技术组的活动，鼓励他们冲破一切困难，同落后的习惯势力作斗争。当时很多社员不明白技术组的作用，看到他们经常跑到试验田里进行观察，有人就讽刺说，这是“磨洋工”，既浪费人力，又糟蹋土地。年轻的姑娘张焕英在田里进行品种培育时，有人故意提出许多问题难她，张焕英因为试验还无结果，只好回答说：“这个问题还得研究研究。”一些好说讽刺话的人，见了面就称她为“研究研究”。技术组的青年虽然不断地受到讽刺和挖苦，但由于受到党组织的重视和支持，没有被这些冷讽热嘲所压倒。技术组成立的第二年，从外地买来了“燕大八一一”谷子良种，在试验田里密植了七分作试验，每亩合四万二千株，比当地一般谷子密一倍。定苗以后，老农张元才说：“走到地里就不能睁眼，一看这么密就气得慌，别看苗好，也不能秀穗。”后来秀了穗，他又固执地说：“秀穗也不能结粒。”到谷子成熟时，社员们去收割，张元才还认为收不到什么，不愿去。大家把他拥了去，他连看也不看，只是摇头叹气。结果打出来一称，每亩合八百二十三斤，比当地一般产量高一倍以上。张元才这才说：“良种密植我老汉算服了。”技术组就是这样在党的领导下，从不断的斗争中成长起来。但是，科学技术真正普及到全乡，为广大群众所接受，还是公社化以后的事情。
    1958年8月间，全乡二十个高级社合并成立了一个人民公社。人民公社的建立和生产的大跃进，更加迫切地要求广泛地采用新技术；同时公社化运动也为开展群众性的科学研究、推广新技术、培养技术人材创设了优越的条件，开辟了广阔的道路。公社一成立，就在社党委的领导下，在党委委员、公社社长徐建春的具体指导下，迅速地建立了自己的科学技术队伍：社里成立了科学技术委员会、农业技术站、红专学校以及拖拉机站、气象站、畜牧兽医站等；各大队都建立了青年技术队、农业机械队、老农顾问委员会；各小队都配备了技术员，有的还建立了技术小组，自上而下形成了一个系统的科学技术网。这种群众性的科学技术队伍，是技术革命的强大力量，为农业科学研究打下了良好的基础。
    从简单的试验到复杂的研究
    公社化以后，科学研究活动，不但从两个技术组的十几个人普及到全社，而且使技术革新的内容和科学研究的领域更加广阔，探讨的问题更加深入。假如过去亩产百八十斤或几百斤的时候，依靠固有的经验可以解决的话，那么今天要亩产千斤，或者更高的产量，没有更高的科学技术，就不能解决问题了。西由人民公社的科学研究，正是根据这种新的需要，沿着步步深入、步步提高、由小到大、由初级到高级的道路前进的。公社化前，两个技术组只种着几亩试验田，在水、肥、土、密、种等几个主要方面作一些简单的对比试验。现在公社和生产大队一下子拿出五百多亩土地，给红专学校和青年技术队作试验田和示范田，并为他们添置了必要的科学研究仪器和设备，其中包括温室、显微镜、标本室等。科学研究的规模更大了，项目更多了，也更系统、更完善了。他们根据生产的需要，以农业“八字宪法”为中心内容，研究各种农作物在各种土壤、气候等自然条件下的生长规律；研究各种农作物所需要的水分和肥料；研究各种品种的优劣，并培育新品种；研究预防小麦倒伏，防治各种病虫害的方法，以及耕作密植等各种技术；研究牲畜的饲养、管理、繁殖和防疫；对每日气候变化作详细的记录。目前他们的试验项目已达八十二项。试验的方法也是越来越多样，越来越复杂。1959年的小麦试验中，光红专学校就划了三百多个试验小区，对“八字宪法”的每一个字，都作了几次试验、几十个处理。在试验设计上，也更加科学了。田间观察都有详细记录，并且建立了档案资料，这大大提高了试验的准确性。在试验中，他们还引用了农业科学研究上的一些最先进的科学成就。如和省农业科学院物理研究所合作，进行了同位素钴60处理玉米种、用X射线处理小麦种的试验；与安东制药厂合作，进行了植物生长刺激素——萘乙酸钠和萘氧乙酸钠的效果试验。红专学校在一年中，试制成功了九种细菌肥料和三种农药，其中固氮菌剂、矽酸盐菌肥、根瘤菌肥和磷菌肥已经大量生产，除了满足本社需要，还和县商业局订了销售合同，大批推销。
    除了红专学校和青年技术队大搞试验而外，各个生产小队也都结合耕作，在大田里作了许多试验。这种广泛的试验活动，大大加快了科学普及的进程。比如一种试验，在一个单位试验成功，还不敢推广，但同时在几个单位一齐试验，得出共同的结论，就有把握推广了。因此，它既增强了领导上推广新技术的决心，也使群众容易接受。
    抓住关键　打开关键
    从实际需要出发，解决生产中急需解决的问题，这是党组织给科学研究工作规定的一个重要原则。麦子发生了谷长椿象虫害，用六六六药水喷打了好几次都不见效。技术组长张宝吉在党组织的指导下，和技术员们不分昼夜地在田间观察，终于发现了这种虫害的活动规律，找到了药治无效的原因。原来这种害虫在每天上午八九点钟气温达二十四度以后才出来活动，下午两点以后，气温下降，它就躲在地里不出来。它活动的范围在麦秆的第二三节。社里根据这个发现，指示各生产队改变了喷药时间和方法，很快地消灭了谷长椿象。技术组和技术队就是这样在党的领导下，细心观察，苦心钻研，完全掌握了当地三十多种虫害的习性和防治方法，历年来对玉米危害很大的钻心虫，由于1959年试验成功用毒沙药治，就被彻底消灭了。良种是增产的一个重要关键，党组织和社委会把搜集、试验、培育优良品种的任务交给了技术队和技术组。几年来他们搜集了大量的品种进行试验，只后吕一个技术队，就搜集了二百七十四种小麦品种、三十二种玉米品种，建立了“原始品种圃”。王贾一个技术队就培育成功了五种玉米新品种，而且还有一百四十九个小麦杂交组合正在分离。经过多次地反复地对比试验，红专学校和后吕、王贾、诸冯三个技术队得出了共同的结论：玉米品种在当地以“安东马牙十一号”、“金皇后”、“黄县二马牙”产量为最高，小麦品种以“钱交”、“早洋”、“碧蚂四号”、“蚰子麦”产量为最高。这些品种比当地品种，最低的增产15％，最高的增产30％以上。现在全社普遍地使用了这些品种，全部实现了良种化。实行作物密植以后，通风透光和防止倒伏的问题，很快地排到科学研究的日程上了。现在他们已研究出一些很好的方法。例如，密植后的玉米双株留苗问题，有人说增产，有人说减产，技术队的试验结果证明，每亩四千株时，单株比双株增产16．5％；每亩四千五百株到五千株时，双株比单株增产4．8％到11．1％；每亩七千株时，单、双株没有什么差异。根据他们的观察研究，玉米在四千株以下，密度不很大，单株留苗，株与株分布均匀，有利于根系的发展，如果双株留苗，就互相遮光，影响生长。但是，在四千株以上，随着密度的加大，田间通风透光的不良影响就要增多，双株留苗可以加大行距，改善通风透光的情况。到了七千株时，因为株距很小，单双株难以分出来，所以产量也没有差别。技术队进行这样的实际试验和科学分析，令人信服地回答了人们在生产中遇到的各种各样的问题。
            全面革新　普遍推广
    新的科学技术和公社组织生产的强大力量一结合，就产生了无穷无尽的力量，仅仅一年，就在耕作制度和耕作技术方面进行了许多重大的改革。过去这里的庄稼绝大部分是两年三作，一年两作的土地到1957年只占耕地的50％，公社化后的头一年就增加到85％以上。根据1959年的产量计算，一年两作，每亩可收小麦三百零三斤，玉米六百斤，共计九百零三斤；如果按两年三作计算，每亩谷子五百斤，大豆一百五十斤，小麦三百零三斤，共计九百五十三斤。两年的产量比一年的产量只多五十斤。在改两年三作为一年两作的同时，还扩大了间种套作的面积，现在全公社除了小麦而外，几乎看不到一种单一的作物，就连白菜、萝卜地也套作了小麦，真是“地无空闲，四季常青”。耕种方法的改变更为突出，完全改变了浅耕稀植、管理粗放的习惯。拿1959年秋季种植的小麦来讲，除了社里的万亩丰产区、大队的千亩丰产方、小队的百亩丰产片的水平更高以外，全公社四万多亩普通麦田几乎一个规格：深耕六寸到八寸，施肥六千斤到八千斤，下种二十五斤到三十斤，播种期都在秋分到寒露期间，而且完全实现了大地畦田化。种完小麦，社员们高兴地说：“现在种的小麦是不早不晚，不深不浅，不稀不密，规格一致，三类苗从胎里就消灭了。没有共产党的领导，没有人民公社的力量，怎么也办不到。”再拿玉米的管理来讲，过去一般都是一次施肥，遇上旱天才浇水，现在则改为分期施肥，分期浇水，一般都是上两次肥，浇四次水，过去间苗一般都叫儿童去做，现在都由技术较高的人做，达到苗旺苗齐，有利通风透光和充分授粉；中耕锄草过去一般是一次，现在一般是二至三次，过去多是病虫害发生了以后才治，现在是以防代治。
    耕作方法的改变，给工具改革提供了新的课题，每一项新技术的推广，都要有相应的生产工具。比如，密植就要有密植耧，深耕就要有深耕犁。1958年秋播时，把八寸宽的小脚耧都改成了六寸宽的大脚耧，1959年又创制了三百二十七部深耕犁。为了迅速地推广畦田化，后邓技术队创造了整畦工具，带在马拉播种机的后面，连播带整畦一遍完成，省去了专门整畦的工序。1958年冬打机井时买不到机井钻，社办机械厂就用马掌大的碎铁，连夜锤炼，打出二百八十斤重的机井钻二十六个，保证了打井任务的完成。1959年治虫时，又赶制了四十部大型喷雾器，支援除虫工作。公社化后一年，全社共创造和仿制了新式工具一万二千零六十七件，其中包括玉米脱粒机一百台，地瓜切片机一百五十台。工具的改革，提高了劳动生产率，节省了大量劳动力，为进一步改革耕作方法创造了有利条件。
        公社的参谋部　群众的问事处
    在进行科学研究和推广新技术当中，青年技术队和红专学校是两种很好的形式，也是技术革命中一支最活跃的力量。公社党委和各大队总支紧紧地抓住这两种形式，作为自己的技术参谋部，进行科学技术的试验和推广。红专学校是一种新型的农业技术学校，与一般的农校不同。它的学习方法是间日制，一天学习，一天劳动，理论联系实际，学用紧密结合。为了适应这种教学方法，公社拨给他们一百二十九亩地，学校自己建立了细菌肥料厂、牲畜饲养场、果园苗圃等，作为创高产、搞试验和劳动实习的场所。因此，它既是培养技术人材的学校，又是进行科学研究的阵地，也是公社的技术参谋部。全校共有学生一百零六名，全是十七岁以下的高小毕业生。他们的生活完全依靠学校的生产所得实行供给制。他们的学制是三年。对一个十五、六岁的高小毕业生来说，三年的学习和劳动，实际上是一个正式参加劳动的准备过程。他们毕业以后，人长大了，劳动本领提高了，并且具有一定的科学技术水平，这就可以成为一个新型的农民。为了解决生产上的急需，一年中红专学校还为各个生产队训练了各种技术人员一百二十四名。随着农业机械的大量增加，他们还开办了短期训练班，训练了三批机械手，共计一百七十多人。
    青年技术队，是在生产大队直接领导下的一个单位，一般有十来个人，种地二、三十亩。他们的经常任务是：学习、试验、推广新技术；创造高额丰产，为全队树立标兵；协助大队制订技术管理措施，负责各小队大片丰产方的技术指导。这是一支技术传播队伍。他们的学习虽然不及红专学校那样系统，学习的时间不那么长，但是通过实际试验和生产劳动，也是大量培养技术人材的阵地。他们在生产中针对关键问题进行试验研究，给生产队作出样子，受到广大社员的普遍欢迎。社员们遇到了什么难解决的问题，便跑去找青年技术队帮忙。公社党委和各大队的党总支也不断地在红专学校、各青年技术队开现场会，传播他们的新技术和先进经验。社员们高兴地说：“种地不会，问技术队；要想高产，学习‘红专’（学校）。”
      科学武装了群众　群众爱上了科学
    群众性的科学研究，开始使农业生产中的体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，能劳动、有知识、具有共产主义风格的一代新人迅速成长起来。正如副社长张永茂所说：“飞机大炮，也不是天生的，而是人一步一步研究出来的。别人能作，我们为什么不能作？”他们就是抱着这样的雄心大志，来攻克科学堡垒的。张永茂原是一个普通农民，经过几年的苦心钻研，创造了机器磨、饲料粉碎机、玉米点播器等许多新式农具，成为技术革新的能手。在作物栽培和管理方面，他也进行了许多有成效的研究和试验。现在他成了省农业科学院的兼职研究员。后吕技术队长徐建民，是个育种能手。为了培育新品种，他和队员们四处奔走，搜罗优良品种。同时他还学会了运用植物有性杂交和无性杂交的育种方法，学会了玉米自交系双交种的先进育种方法，搞了六十三个组合。养猪场年轻的女场长王克英，高小毕业后三年，就学会了饲养、管理、繁殖、防疫的全套养猪技术。因为她给猪治病的技术很高，社员都称她是“猪先生”。各方面的出色人物，一个接一个地涌现出来。现在全公社已有技术员、机械员、兽医员五百五十四人。这种农业技术上的新人材，将随着人民公社的成长，越来越多，越来越强。
    农业科学技术在生产中发生的巨大作用，大大地解放了人们的思想，打开了人们的脑筋。过去，凡是一种新技术的提出，新工具的改革，新制度的规定，总是遭到保守思想的抵制。有些人总爱拿“老辈没见过”、“老辈没这么做”的话，来反对新技术的推广。而现在，由于新技术的广泛利用，广大社员从亲身体验中，认准了科学技术的好处，对科学发生了兴趣。“讲科学，学科学，用科学”，成了群众舆论的中心。“试验试验”，“研究研究”，成了人们的口头语。队队搞试验，人人学科学，已成了普遍风气。从公社党委书记到一般社员，都参加了科学研究工作。年近七十岁的老社员李作坤，还进行了防治谷子白发病和高粱黑穗病的试验。1959年麦收时，四百名小学生参加了田间选种和搜集“变异穗”的活动，共搜集了有培植试验价值的“变异穗”十七种。科学神秘化的思想被打破了。社员们说：“能多打粮食，就有科学”。同时，大面积高额丰产田的连续出现，对“增产到顶论”的思想，也是一个冲击。1959年红专学校种的一百二十九亩试验田，平均亩产一千六百三十二斤，比一般生产队的大田产量高一倍。这个事实，雄辩地告诉人们：土地还大有潜力。社员们说：“看看自己种的地觉得满好了，和‘红专’一比，我们还得使大劲才能赶上。”
      科学技术大发展　没有公社办不到
    一年来社办科学的事实证明，科学事业的发展如此迅速，技术革新的成就如此之大，如果没有人民公社，那是很难办到的。过去，农业社户数少，规模小，力量单薄，不可能拿出这样多的人力和土地，专门进行科学技术的研究工作。同时，小社由于组织规模、活动范围的限制，新的技术也不易全面推开。公社化以后，政社合一，原来的高级社变成了公社的生产大队，这就可以按照公社的统一规划进行生产，执行统一的技术规格。同时，“一大二公”的人民公社也有充分的条件，采用新的科学技术，进行大规模的技术改革。例如，要将两年三作改为一年两作，增加一季作物，就需要有足够的劳动力。过去很多农业社不能进行这项改革，与社小劳动力不足有很大关系。但是公社化以后，由于劳动力能在更大范围内统筹安排，挖掘了劳动潜力；由于举办了许多福利事业（托儿所、食堂、缝纫组等），解放了六千多名妇女劳动力；由于农业机械的发展（新增添拖拉机八台，煤气机、锅驼机六十七部，脱粒机八部，联合收割机一部，汽车一辆），大大提高了劳动效率，这就使进行这项改革有了足够的条件。同时，社办工业的蓬勃发展，也给工具改革创造了良好的条件。
    人民公社打开了科学的大门，为群众性的科学研究开辟了道路。西由人民公社的社员们，正沿着这条广阔的道路，大踏步地前进！
