Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: A mass movement to vigorously run forest farms has emerged in people's communes across the country this year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Forestry up to mid-March, people's communes and production teams across the country have established more than 70,000 forest farms. These forest farms are specialized production organizations engaged in afforestation and forest management by the people's communes. The widespread development of commune-run forest farms has greatly promoted the rapid development of various timber forest bases, economic forest bases, and other forestry production bases, and promoted the rapid growth and high yield movement in forestry production, bringing China's socialist forestry construction into a new stage.

As early as before communization, some agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas had already established forest farms and forestry professional teams. After communization, due to the superiority of the people's communes being large in size and collective in nature, and adhering to the principle of "grain as the key link, with diversified undertakings," vigorous development of forestry production has led to a rapid development of forestry construction in our country. Thousands-of-mu forests and tens-of-thousands-of-mu forests created by communes or production teams have emerged continuously, which has laid the foundation for the rapid development of commune-run forest farms. Since last year, a mass movement to run commune-run forest farms has been widely launched. As of now, people's communes in Fujian Province have established 776 forest farms operated at the commune level and 1,229 forest farms operated at the basic accounting unit level, organizing a forestry professional team of more than 100,000 people who are engaged in forestry production year-round. By March 12, all rural people's communes in 64 cities and counties in Heilongjiang Province had established commune-run forest farms. It has achieved the goal of "where there is forest, there is a farm," and forest management is forest farmized. Commune-run forest farms in Hebei, Shanxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces and regions have also developed rapidly. Many provinces and regions have made plans for vigorously running forest farms, proposing to achieve forest farmization of forestry management in the next one to two years.

After the establishment of commune-run forest farms, forestry production has a professional team, which combines mass shock production with the year-round production of professional teams, accelerating the speed of afforestation and improving the quality of afforestation, so that forestry production has taken root in the people's communes. Due to the large-scale development of commune-run forest farms in Henan Province, the amount of afforestation in the winter season of 1959 increased more than doubled compared to the total amount of afforestation in 1958, and the specifications and quality of afforestation have also been greatly improved. Due to the vigorous development of commune-run forest farms in Hubei Province last year, the afforestation area in the winter alone reached more than 4 million mu, exceeding the province's historical winter afforestation area. While vigorously carrying out afforestation, commune-run forest farms in various places have begun to conduct comprehensive management of the existing forests and young forests planted in recent years. Many commune-run forest farms have professional teams such as forest protection and forest management, engaged in various forestry production tasks such as seedling cultivation, afforestation, forest fire prevention, tending of young forests, forest product industry, and timber production, undertaking various tasks of mountain forest production management. Commune-run forest farms in many natural secondary forest areas have further utilized and transformed natural secondary forests, so that natural secondary forests have entered a new stage of comprehensive management and comprehensive development from past closure and maintenance to protection, tending, transformation, and utilization. Many people's communes in Tianshui Prefecture, Gansu Province, took on the task of transforming the region's natural secondary forests after establishing forest farms last year, transforming the forest appearance, accelerating the growth of trees, and making full use of forest by-products, increasing commune income.

Commune-run forest farms have greatly promoted the rapid growth and high-yield movement of trees, making forestry production change from seasonal operation to year-round operation, from extensive management to meticulous management, and from natural growth of trees to artificial cultivation. Since last winter, Henan Province has planted more than 1 million mu of fast-growing and high-yield forests. The commune-run forest farm of Caitun Commune, Chiping County, Shandong Province, has created more than 1,300 mu of fast-growing and high-yield forests since last year, with a survival rate of over 95%.

Commune-run forest farms in various places focus on forestry, carry out diversified management, implement intercropping of forests and grains, and develop sideline production, achieving short-term support for long-term development, combining short-term and long-term, and promoting each other. It has not only enriched the content of production, increased the forest by-products needed for socialist construction and people's production and life, and prospered the mountain economy; but also accumulated a large amount of funds for the commune, making the commune economy further strengthened and developed. Last year, ten commune (brigade) forest farms of Gaofeng People's Commune in Cili County, Hunan Province, afforested a total of 21,000 mu, with a survival rate of over 90%; and cultivated 29 million seedlings. At the same time, it also earned more than 160,000 jin of grain and more than 27,000 yuan in cash. Combining the tending of young forests, the commune-run forest farms in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, produced a large amount of firewood, tree strips, hoe handles, and basket bands in one year. Many commune-run forest farms in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions have also carried out comprehensive utilization of wood such as wood processing and forest product chemistry, as well as forest sideline production such as operating wood ear, mushroom, and hunting, increasing income and changing the appearance of forest areas.

Commune-run forest farms have also created good conditions for developing forestry education and carrying out scientific research. Fujian Province has already held more than 100 various spare-time schools and "red and expert" schools. Taking real objects as teaching materials and the production site as the classroom, the commune-run forest farm in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, has trained more than 2,800 forestry technicians in one year. These technicians generally master technologies such as afforestation, seed collection, and seedling cultivation. The 47 forest farms in this county have also established Michurin groups.

The widespread development and continuous improvement of commune-run forest farms will greatly accelerate the process of forest baseization, forest farmization, and high-yieldization, and promote the rapid development of forestry production. (Attached pictures)

    社社队队办林场　迅速实现林场化
    全国各地人民公社和生产队已办起林场七万多个
    据新华社26日讯　全国各地人民公社，今年兴起了大办林场的群众运动。据林业部到3月中旬的统计，全国各地人民公社和生产队所办的林场已达七万多个。这些林场是人民公社从事造林营林的专业生产组织。社办林场的普遍发展，大大地促进各种用材林基地、经济林基地和其他林业生产基地的迅速发展，并促进林业生产的速生丰产运动，使我国社会主义林业建设进入了一个新的阶段。
    早在公社化以前，有些山区的农业社就已经举办林场和林业专业队。公社化后，由于人民公社一大二公的优越性和以粮为纲、五业并举，大力发展林业生产，使我国林业建设有了飞跃的发展，公社或生产队所造的千亩林、万亩林不断出现，这就为社办林场的迅速发展打下了基础。去年以来，一个社办林场的群众运动就广泛地展开了。福建省各人民公社到目前为止，已办起公社一级经营的林场七百七十六个，基本核算单位一级经营的林场一千二百二十九个，组织了十万多人的林业专业队伍，常年从事林业生产。黑龙江省到3月12日全省六十四个市县的农村人民公社已经全部建立起社办林场。作到了有林就有场，林业经营林场化。河北、山西、湖南、广西、贵州、江苏、安徽等省区的社办林场也有了迅速的发展。许多省区都作了大办林场的规划，提出要在最近一两年内实现林业经营林场化。
    社办林场建立后，林业生产有了专业队伍，使群众性突击生产和专业队伍常年生产相结合，加快了造林的速度和提高了造林的质量，使林业生产在人民公社扎下了根。河南省由于大搞社办林场，1959年冬季一季造林数量比1958年全年造林总数增长一倍以上，造林的规格质量也大为提高。湖北省由于去年大力地发展了社办林场，仅去年冬季造林即达四百多万亩，超过该省历年冬季造林面积。各地社办林场在大力开展造林的同时对原有的森林和几年来所造的幼林开始进行了全面的经营和管理。许多社办林场都设有护林、营林等专业队伍，从事育苗、造林、护林防火、幼林抚育、林产工业、木材生产等各项林业生产工作，担负起了山林生产经营管理的各项任务。许多天然次生林地区的社办林场，进一步对天然次生林进行了利用和改造，使天然次生林由过去封养、保养，进入保护、抚育、改造、利用全面经营，全面发展的新阶段。甘肃省天水专区许多人民公社去年办起林场后，担负起全区的天然次生林改造任务，改造了林相，加速了林木生长，并且充分利用了林副产品，增加了公社收入。
    社办林场大大地促进了林木速生丰产运动，使林业生产由季节性作业变成了常年作业，由粗放经营变为细致经营，林木由自然生长，变为人工培育。河南省去冬以来共种值速生丰产林一百多万亩。山东省茌平县菜屯公社社办林场，去年以来共造速生丰产林一千三百多亩，成活率达到95％以上。
    各地社办林场以林为主，开展多种经营，实行林粮间作，发展副业生产，作到了以短养长，长短结合，互相促进。不仅丰富了生产内容，增加了社会主义建设和人民生产、生活所需要的林副产品，繁荣了山区经济；而且还给公社积累了大量资金，使公社经济得到了进一步壮大和发展。湖南省慈利县高峰人民公社十个社（队）林场，去年一年共造林二万一千亩，成活率达90％以上；育苗二千九百万株。同时还收入粮食十六万多斤，现金二万七千多元。河南省登封县社办林场，结合幼林抚育，一年生产了大量薪柴、树条、锄头把、箩筐绊等。福建、浙江、江苏、黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古等省区的许多社办林场，还开展了木材加工、林产化学等木材综合利用，以及经营木耳、蘑菇、狩猎等林副业生产，增加了收入，改变了林区生产面貌。
    社办林场还为发展林业教育和开展科学研究工作，创造了良好条件。福建省已经举办了各种业余学校、“红专”学校一百多所。河南省登封县社办林场以实物为教材，以生产现场为课堂，一年来培养林业技术员二千八百多名，这些技术员一般都掌握了造林、采种、育苗等技术。这个县的四十七个林场还建立了米丘林小组。
    社办林场的普遍发展和不断提高，将大大加速林业基地化、林场化、丰产化的过程，促进林业生产迅速发展。（附图片）
