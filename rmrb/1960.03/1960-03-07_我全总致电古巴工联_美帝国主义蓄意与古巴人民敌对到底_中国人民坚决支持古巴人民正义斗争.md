    ACFTU Cables Cuban Trade Union
    U.S. Imperialism Deliberately Antagonistic to Cuban People
    Chinese People Firmly Support Cuban People's Just Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th—The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today cabled the Cuban Trade Union, condemning the U.S. imperialists for instigating counter-revolutionary elements to create an ammunition explosion in Havana Harbor, Cuba, resulting in the injury and death of more than one hundred Cuban workers, a barbaric crime, and expressing deep condolences and sympathy to the Cuban workers.
    The cable said: "The U.S. imperialists' constant dispatch of aircraft to bomb Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields, their decision to conduct military exercises in the Caribbean Sea threatening Cuba, and the creation of this explosion further expose the U.S. imperialists' malicious intention to be deliberately antagonistic to the Cuban and Latin American people to the very end, and reveal Eisenhower's despicable conspiracy in his activities in Latin America. We strongly protest the U.S. imperialists' provocative activities against the Cuban people, firmly support the Cuban people's just struggle, and firmly believe that you will achieve even greater victories."

    电报说：“美帝国主义者不断派飞机轰炸古巴糖厂与甘蔗田、决定在加勒比海进行威胁古巴的军事演习和制造这次爆炸事件，进一步暴露了美帝国主义蓄意与古巴和拉丁美洲人民为敌到底的罪恶意图，和揭穿了艾森豪威尔去拉丁美洲活动的卑鄙阴谋。我们强烈抗议美帝国主义对古巴人民的挑衅活动，坚决支持古巴人民的正义斗争，并深信你们一定会取得更大的胜利。”
