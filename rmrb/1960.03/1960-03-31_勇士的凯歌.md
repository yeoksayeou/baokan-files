    Triumph of the Heroes
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang

    After forty-nine days, the longest drift in the world, Soviet soldiers Ziganshin, Kryuchkovsky, Fedotov, and Poplavsky finally returned to the heart of their homeland—Moscow—on March 29th. All the Soviet people welcomed them with boundless excitement and pride, and extended their warm greetings.

    From January 17th of this year, when they were hit by a hurricane in the Kuril Islands, they endured severe trials of hurricane, waves, cold, and hunger, and finally returned to their country, which can be called a miracle in the history of world navigation. The heroic spirit shown by these four young Soviet soldiers once again proved to the world the bravery and strength of Soviet soldiers. They used the excellent qualities of Soviet people to sing a soaring song of triumph for the heroes.

    The four Soviet soldiers had no preparation, either mentally or materially, before the drifting. They were swept into the sea by a hurricane after completing a transport mission. The food they had with them consisted of only two small cans of canned pork, a small can of lard, a whole loaf of black bread, two cans of potatoes, and some fresh water. These things would normally only last for two days, but they sustained them for forty-nine days!

    Secondly, these four Soviet soldiers were not seasoned sailors, nor were they sailors who had long been involved with the ocean, but young men who had just enlisted in the army not long ago. Ziganshin, the captain of the barge, was only twenty-two years old, and he enlisted in August 1958. Before joining the army, this Tatar youth was a member of a collective farm in the Kuibyshev region; the other two Ukrainian youths, Kryuchkovsky and Poplavsky, also grew up in the countryside; only Fedotov, a Russian youth, had sailed on the Amur River for a year or two, but the experience of river navigation was far from sufficient in the vast Pacific Ocean. It was under such circumstances that the four Soviet youths began their drift.

    After the hurricane raged for three days and nights, it finally subsided temporarily. Who among these exhausted men didn't want to eat something good? But the food and fresh water on board were limited, and each person could only eat a small amount of dry food and drink a few mouthfuls of fresh water each day. By the seventh day of drifting, there was not much food left, so they decided to eat only one meal every two days. On the sixteenth day of drifting, after they cooked a pot of soup with the last few potatoes, they couldn't find any more food on the boat. But the four Soviet Communist Youth League members never lost heart. Captain Ziganshin often encouraged everyone, saying: "We will definitely be discovered. The main problem is to preserve ourselves and hold on!" Fedotov told everyone the stories of Soviet heroes Meresyev and Babanin to encourage them. Poplavsky and Kryuchkovsky talked about the life in their hometown of Ukraine, while the Tatar youth Ziganshin told stories about national heroes he had heard as a child. February 23rd was the Soviet Army Day. On this day, four ordinary Soviet soldiers, far away from their homeland, with their personal lives hanging by a thread, celebrated this glorious holiday on the barge.

    Time passed day by day, and everyone's body became weaker. The food was gone, and leather shoes and belts became the objects of being put into the pot. The fresh water was also finished, so they used utensils to collect rainwater at the bow of the boat to quench their thirst. Finally, when everyone could no longer find any leather items on their bodies, Poplavsky looked at his beloved accordion, played the last tune with his tired hands, and had to take the leather off the accordion and put it in the pot…

    During the forty-nine days of drifting, the temperature never exceeded seven degrees Celsius, and was always around zero degrees. During the warmer daytime, they once tried to use the two fish hooks they found on the boat to fish, but the sea fish would not eat their bait. Once, a large shark swam by the boat, and Ziganshin tried to stab it with a fork, but his weak hands could not stab the shark in the ocean.

    Although the difficulties increased day by day, the young people educated by the Lenin Communist Youth League were not intimidated by the difficulties. In order not to miss any chance of being rescued, they were on watch on the boat all day long. These four young people with Soviet optimism often joked, supported each other, and encouraged each other.

    After drifting for five weeks, their bodies were difficult to support. In order to reduce physical exertion, everyone finally lay down in the cabin until 4:00 pm on March 7th, when Ziganshin heard the sound of an airplane again. He went to the deck and waved a distress signal again. A plane finally circled over the barge. After a while, a helicopter from the American aircraft carrier "Kearsarge" threw down a rope ladder. Captain Ziganshin let everyone get on the plane, and he was the last to leave the barge. Because he was so tired and hungry, he lost consciousness after getting on the plane. This ended the forty-nine days of drifting.

    On the aircraft carrier, when people asked these four Soviet soldiers what they hoped for, they replied in unison that their only hope was to "return to the motherland as soon as possible."

    On March 15th, the four Soviet heroes arrived in San Francisco, and their heroic deeds caused a sensation in the United States. When some American reporters wanted to find some "superhuman" characteristics in the four Soviet youths, Ziganshin frankly replied to them: "We have not done anything extraordinary. We are the most ordinary Soviet people. Any Soviet soldier in our situation would act like us." But this is precisely what many Americans cannot understand. Several American publishers wanted to pay a huge sum of money to these four Soviet soldiers, asking them to agree to hand over the publication rights of their drifting experiences to them for monopoly, but they were refused. This is also something that some Americans cannot understand. But this precisely explains the real reason why they were able to overcome difficulties: because they are Soviet people!

    勇士的凯歌
    本报记者　崔永昌
    经过了四十九昼夜世界上最长的一次漂流以后，苏联士兵齐甘申、克留奇科夫斯基、费多托夫和波普拉夫斯基终于在3月29日回到了祖国的心脏——莫斯科。全体苏联人民都以无限兴奋和骄傲的心情欢迎他们，并向他们表示亲切的慰问。
    从今年1月17日在千岛群岛受到飓风袭击起，他们经受了飓风、海浪、寒冷、饥饿的严重考验，最后终于回到了祖国，这可以说是世界航海史中的一个奇迹。而这四位年青的苏联士兵表现的英勇气概，再一次向世界证明了苏联士兵的英勇和坚强，他们用苏维埃人的优秀品质，高唱出一曲响彻云霄的勇士的凯歌。
    四个苏联士兵在漂流之前无论在精神上或物质上都没有任何准备。他们是在完成一次运输任务以后被飓风刮到大海里边去的。他们随身带的食物只有两小筒罐头猪肉，一小筒猪油，一整块黑面包，两筒土豆和一些淡水。这些东西在通常的情况下，只能够两天吃的，而他们却支持了四十九天！
    其次，这四位苏联士兵并不是饱经风波的海员，也不是长期与海洋打交道的水兵，而是不久前才刚刚入伍的青年。驳船上的船长齐甘申才刚满二十二岁，他是1958年8月才入伍的。这个鞑靼族的青年，在入伍前是古比雪夫州集体农庄的庄员；另外两个乌克兰青年克留奇科夫斯基和波普拉夫斯基也是在农村长大的；只有一个俄罗斯族的青年费多托夫曾在阿穆尔河上航行过一两年，但是河上行船的经验在巨大的太平洋中就显得非常不够了。就是在这样的情况下，四个苏联青年开始了漂流。
    飓风刮了三个昼夜以后，总算暂时平息了，这几个筋疲力尽的人谁不想好好地吃些东西呢？但是船上的食物和淡水有限，每人每天只能吃很少的干粮，喝几口淡水。在漂流的第七天，粮食就剩下不多了，这时他们决定两天吃一顿饭。在漂流的第十六天，他们用最后的几个土豆煮了一锅汤以后，在船上就再也找不到任何食物了。可是四个苏联共青团员一刻也没有灰心。船长齐甘申经常鼓励大家说：“我们一定会被人发现，主要问题是保存自己，支持下来！”费多托夫向大家讲起了苏联英雄密烈西耶夫和巴巴宁的故事来鼓舞大家。波普拉夫斯基和克留奇科夫斯基讲起了家乡乌克兰的生活情景，鞑靼族的青年齐甘申则讲起了小时候听来的关于民族英雄的故事。2月23日，是苏联建军节。这一天，四个普通的苏联士兵，在远离国土、个人生命系于千钧一发的时候，在驳船上庆祝了这个光荣的节日。
    时间一天天地过去了，每个人的身体都弱了下来，食物没有了，皮鞋皮带都变成了下锅的对象，淡水也喝完了，他们就用器皿摆在船头接些雨水来止渴。最后，当每个人身上再也找不出一点皮制的东西的时候，波普拉夫斯基看了看自己心爱的手风琴，用他疲惫的双手拉了最后一只曲子，就不得不把手风琴上的皮子拆了下来，下到锅里……
    在四十九天漂流的过程中，气温始终没有超过零上七度，总是在零度上下。在白天较暖时，他们曾经想用在船上找到的两个鱼钩来钓鱼，但是海鱼不吃他们的鱼饵。有一次，一条大沙鱼从船边游过，齐甘申曾想用叉子来刺它，但是他无力的双手哪里还能刺得到海洋中的沙鱼呢？
    尽管困难一天天加重，但是列宁共青团教育出来的青年，并没有被困难吓倒。为了不放过任何一个得救的机会，他们成天在船上放哨。这四个具有苏维埃人乐观主义精神的青年经常说笑话，互相支持，彼此鼓励。
    在漂流了五个星期以后，他们的身体已经难以支持了。为了减少体力消耗，大家最后全躺在舱中，直到3月7日下午四点钟，齐甘申果然又听到了飞机的声音，他走到船板上再一次打求救信号，有一架飞机终于在驳船上空回旋起来，又过了一会儿，由美国“歧沙治号”航空母舰起飞的直升飞机，把一个绳索梯扔了下来，船长齐甘申让大家上了飞机以后，自己最后一个离开驳船，因为累饿交加，他上了飞机以后，就失去了知觉。这样才结束了四十九天的漂流。
    在航空母舰上当人们问这四个苏联士兵有什么希望时，他们异口同声地回答说，唯一的希望是“尽早地回到祖国。”
    3月15日苏联的四勇士到了旧金山，他们的英勇事迹一时轰动了美国。当一些美国记者想从四位苏联青年身上找出一些“超人”的特点时，齐甘申坦率地回答他们说：“我们并没有做出什么奇异的事情，我们是最普通的苏联人，任何一个苏联士兵处在我们的情况下，他全会像我们一样地行动。”而正是这一点却是许多美国人所不能了解的。有几个美国出版社曾想出一笔巨款给这四个苏联士兵，要他们答应把关于漂流的事迹交给他们垄断出版，但是受到了拒绝，这也是一些美国人所不能理解的。而这却正说明了他们所以能够克服困难的真正原因：因为他们是苏维埃人！
