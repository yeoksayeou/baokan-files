    Actively expanding the sources of raw materials for light industry and vigorously developing the initial processing of agricultural and sideline products is a crucial key to ensuring the continued leap forward of China's light industry.

    Over the past two years, under the guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, China's light industry has developed very rapidly. In 1959, the total output value of light industry increased by 34% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The output of major products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, salt, and machine-made paper have all reached or exceeded the 1962 targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan. While the output of products has grown at a high speed, the quality of products has generally improved, and tens of thousands of new varieties and designs have been added. Many products that could not be produced in the past are now being produced. The supply of some products in short supply has also greatly increased. The high speed of light industry development plays an important role in the overall leap forward of the national economy. The rapid development of light industry can provide more daily-use industrial products for the growing urban population and the vast rural areas; it can exchange for more grain, non-staple foods, and other agricultural and sideline products; and it can also increase the country's accumulation of large amounts of capital, providing more funds for socialist construction. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the material and cultural living standards of the people in urban and rural areas of our country are constantly improving, and the demand for light industrial products is also constantly increasing. Therefore, in 1960 and in the future, light industry should continue to leap forward. This is an important aspect of ensuring the high-speed and proportionate development of the national economy. The current problem is that the growth of raw materials for light industry still cannot keep up with objective requirements, and we must make greater efforts in this regard.

    In order to ensure the continued leap forward of light industry, the main task at present is to expand the sources of agricultural and sideline raw materials urgently needed by light industry. In recent years, especially since 1958, due to the rapid development of agricultural production, the raw materials for light industry have greatly increased. However, the growth of raw materials still cannot keep up with objective requirements. We must work hard in many ways. First of all, as is well known, it is necessary to seize the production and purchase of various cash crops, and vigorously engage in the collection and processing of wild raw materials. The spring plowing and sowing season has arrived, and ensuring the completion of this year's planned acreage for cash crops is the first hurdle for increasing the production of cash crops throughout the year. All localities should seize this opportunity and take effective measures to plant all kinds of cash crops fully and well according to the state plan. At present, some farmers still have cash crops harvested last autumn, and some crops in season in some places are about to be harvested. These places should seize the purchase work and purchase all the products that should be purchased. The collection of wild raw materials has greatly developed through last year's "small autumn harvest" campaign. This year, we should continue to expand the collection and make fuller use of wild resources. Wild raw materials are not only available in autumn, but also in spring and summer, and even in winter. All localities should organize forces to collect all kinds of wild plants that are currently suitable for collection in a timely manner, and seize this work in the future seasons.

    In expanding the sources of agricultural and sideline raw materials, another important task is to vigorously develop the initial processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials. The processing industry cannot keep up with the actual needs. This is a weak link in the production of raw materials for light industry, and vigorously strengthening this link is an urgent task at present. Over the past two years, the processing and utilization of agricultural crop by-products and wild raw materials have developed to a certain extent, but compared with the needs of raw materials and the possibilities of resource utilization, there is still a large gap. For example, the cotton stalks produced nationwide can be peeled (ripe skin) for about 10 million dan. Even if 50% is utilized, about 200 million burlap bags can be produced, accounting for half of the national annual demand for burlap bags. However, only 500,000 to 700,000 dan were purchased annually in the past two years, accounting for 5%-7% of the output. The annual resource of flax is more than 2 million dan, but only 100,000 to 150,000 dan are purchased annually in these two years, less than 7% of the output. The purchase volume of Apocynum venetum is only about 1% of the output. The low utilization rate of agricultural crop by-products and wild raw materials is largely because the initial processing industry cannot keep up. Many agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials are difficult to use as industrial raw materials without initial processing, and they will be largely idle and wasted. For example, cotton stalk skin and wild fiber cannot be turned into ripe fiber for the textile industry without peeling and degumming; cottonseed cannot be used for oil extraction without delinting and shelling; acorns cannot be used for oil extraction and starch making without shelling, and so on.

    Developing the initial processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials can not only directly increase the raw materials of light industry, but also take fermentation, dry distillation and other chemical treatment methods to produce furfural (plastic raw materials), alcohol, crude glycerin and other organic chemical raw materials; it can also use the by-products of initial processing as feed and fertilizer. Xiaojiadian People's Commune in Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province, obtained a large amount of fertilizer in the process of processing cotton stalk skin into cooked fiber for the textile industry. Since last autumn, Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, has had as much as 200 million jin of powder residue and distiller's grains left over from processing acorns alone. Each pig can be fattened with 1,000 jin of feed, which can feed 200,000 pigs. Seven people's communes in this county increased their accumulation by 8 million yuan and increased the income of commune members by developing the processing industry of wild raw materials, prompting 96 poor teams to catch up with or exceed the rich teams. Vigorously developing the initial processing industry of agricultural crop by-products and wild plant raw materials has many benefits. We should regard the development of the initial processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials as an important aspect of promoting the comprehensive development of agricultural production and promoting the leap forward development of people's commune industry. We must fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people's communes and build a series of processing industries in a planned way in various raw material producing areas to fully utilize agricultural resources and wild resources.

    How can we vigorously develop the initial processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials? We must strengthen the Party's leadership, put politics in command, launch mass movements, adhere to the principle of making do with whatever is available, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improve from indigenous to foreign. The initial processing of agricultural and sideline products, whether it is grain and oil processing, cash crop processing, wild plant processing, or feed processing, is inherently a mass-based work. In order to widely carry out this work, strengthen the places where the processing industry was weak in the past, establish the places where there was no processing industry in the past, and improve the places where there were only relatively simple processing tools in the past, it is even more necessary to put politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out the reform of processing tools, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, strive to improve tools, improve technology, and gradually realize semi-mechanized and mechanized production. At the same time, industrial departments, commercial departments, financial and banking departments should actively cooperate closely with the people's communes, and actively help the people's communes raise funds, design and manufacture equipment without hindering the national key construction, especially to promote technology, help the communes train technical personnel, and bring technology to the countryside and mountains and hand over the technology to the masses. In a word, we should make the development of the initial processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials into a vigorous mass movement.

    A small part of the raw materials of light industry also comes from heavy industry departments, and these raw materials from heavy industry departments play an important role. Obviously, without the necessary metal materials, without the chemical raw materials necessary for chemical treatment, and without enough fuel and electricity, modern light industrial production cannot be carried out. Therefore, the country's heavy industry departments should provide more raw materials, materials, and fuels for light industry, and the relevant departments should conduct careful organizational work, constantly check, and ensure the complete realization of these raw material production and allocation plans.

    Light industrial enterprises should actively tap their own potential, and more widely and deeply carry out the mass movement of rationally saving raw materials and improving the output rate, and make use of waste products and substitutes as much as possible. In this regard, the light industry departments have done a lot of work in the past, and the effect is also very great, but at present the potential is still very large. In the manufacture of various products, there is still a considerable distance between the average consumption quota of raw materials and the advanced consumption quota. Taking the paper industry as an example, advanced units use about 900 kilograms of pulp to make one ton of paper, while ordinary units use about 1,100 kilograms. If the average consumption quota is reduced by 10%, 300,000 tons of paper can be produced this year using the existing raw materials. In the textile industry, appropriately increasing the count of cotton yarn can also save raw materials, spin more yarn, and weave more cloth. Of course, saving raw materials and improving the output rate must at all times be based on ensuring the quality of products, which is in line with the requirements of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction.

    扩大轻工业原料来源  大搞农副产品加工
    积极扩大轻工业原料来源，大搞农副产品的初步加工运动，是保证我国轻工业继续跃进的一个重要关键。
    两年来，在党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，我国轻工业的发展非常迅速。1959年，轻工业总产值比大跃进的1958年增长了34％，棉纱、棉布、盐和机制纸等主要产品产量，都已经达到或者超过了第二个五年计划规定的1962年指标。在产品产量高速度增长的同时，产品质量普遍提高，新增加的花色品种成千上万。许多过去不能生产的产品，现在生产出来了。某些供不应求的产品也大量增加了。轻工业发展的高速度，对于国民经济全面跃进有着重要的作用。轻工业的迅速发展，可以为日益增长的城市人口和广大农村提供更多的日用工业品；可以换回更多的粮食、副食品和其他农副产品；还能够为国家增加大量的积累，为社会主义建设提供更多的资金。在工农业迅速发展的情况下，我国城乡人民的物质生活和文化生活水平不断提高，所需要的轻工业品也在不断增长。因此，1960年和今后轻工业还应当继续跃进。这是保证国民经济高速度按比例地向前发展的一个重要方面。目前的问题是轻工业原料的增长仍然赶不上客观的要求，我们必须在这方面付出更大的努力。
    为了保证轻工业的继续跃进，当前的主要任务是扩大轻工业急需的农副业原料来源。近几年来，特别是1958年以来，由于农业生产的迅速发展，轻工业的原料大大增加了。但是，原料的增长仍然赶不上客观的要求。我们还要从多方面努力。首先，正如人们所熟知的，是要抓紧各种经济作物的生产和收购，大搞野生原料的采集和加工。春耕春播季节已到，保证完成今年经济作物的播种面积计划，是全年增产经济作物的第一关。各地都应当抓紧这个时机，采取有效的措施，把各种经济作物按照国家计划种足、种好。现在有些地方农民手中还有去年秋季收获的经济作物，有些地方当令的一些作物又快要收获，这些地方都应当抓紧收购工作，把应当收购的产品都收购起来。野生原料的采集，经过去年的“小秋收”运动，有了很大的发展。今年我们应当继续扩大采集，更加充分地利用野生资源。野生原料不只是在秋季有，在春季和夏季乃至冬季也有。各地都应当组织力量，把当前适于采集的各种野生植物及时采集起来，并且在今后的各个季节都抓紧这个工作。
    在扩大农副业原料来源方面，还有一项重要的工作，就是大力发展农副产品和野生原料的初步加工业。加工业跟不上实际的需要，这是轻工业原料生产的一个薄弱环节，大力加强这个环节是当前的紧迫任务。两年以来，农作物副产品和野生原料的加工利用有了一定的发展，但是同原料的需要和资源利用的可能相比较，仍有很大距离。例如，全国生产的棉秆可以剥皮（熟皮）一千万担左右，即使利用50％，也可以生产麻袋二亿条左右，占全国每年需用麻袋数的一半，而过去两年每年只收购五十万担到七十万担，占产量的5％—7％。胡麻每年有资源二百多万担，而这两年每年只收购十万担到十五万担，不到产量的7％。罗布麻的收购量只有产量的1％左右。农作物副产品和野生原料的利用率这样低，一个重要原因就是初步加工业赶不上。许多农副产品和野生原料，不经过初步加工就很难用作工业原料，就会大量地闲置和浪费掉。例如棉秆皮和野生纤维，不经过剥离和脱胶，就不能变成熟纤维，就不能用于纺织工业；棉籽不经过脱绒和去壳，就不能用于榨油；橡子不去壳，就不能用来榨油和做淀粉等等。
    发展农副产品和野生原料的初步加工业，不仅仅可以直接增加轻工业的原料，还可以采取发酵、干馏和其他化学处理方法，制造糠醛（塑料原料）、酒精、粗制甘油等有机化学原料；还可以利用初步加工的副产品做饲料和肥料。辽宁省朝阳县肖家店人民公社，在把棉秆皮加工成纺织工业用的熟纤维过程中，就得到了大量的肥料。贵州省剑河县去年秋季以来，仅加工橡子剩下的粉渣、酒糟就有两亿斤之多，每头猪以一千斤饲料计，就可以喂肥二十万头猪。这个县的七个人民公社，通过发展野生原料加工业，共增加积累八百万元，并增加了社员收入，促使九十六个穷队赶上或超过了富队。大力发展农作物副产品和野生植物原料的初步加工业，好处确实很多。我们应当把发展农副产品和野生原料的初步加工业，看做是促进农业生产的全面发展和促进人民公社工业飞跃发展的一个重要的方面。我们要充分调动人民公社的积极性，在各种原料产地有计划地建设一系列的加工业，以充分利用农业资源和野生资源。
    怎样才能大力发展农副产品和野生原料的初步加工业呢？必须加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，坚持因陋就简，土洋并举，由土到洋，逐步提高的方针。农副产品的初步加工，无论是粮油加工、经济作物加工、野生植物加工、饲料加工，本来就是群众性很大的工作。为了把这个工作广泛地开展起来，使过去加工业薄弱的地方加强起来，过去没有加工业的地方建立起来，过去只有比较简单的加工工具的地方提高起来，更必须实行政治挂帅，充分发动群众，大搞加工工具的改革，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，努力改良工具，提高技术，逐步实现半机械化和机械化生产。同时，工业部门、商业部门、财政银行部门，应当主动地同人民公社密切协作，在不妨碍国家重点建设的条件下，积极帮助人民公社筹措资金，设计和制造设备，特别是要推广技术，帮助公社训练技术人员，做到技术下乡，技术上山，把技术交给群众。一句话，我们应当使发展农副产品和野生原料的初步加工业，形成一个声势浩大的群众运动。
    轻工业的原料，还有小部分来自重工业部门，这些来自重工业部门的原料有着重要的作用。很显然，没有必要的金属材料，没有进行化学处理必需的化工原料，没有足够的燃料和电力，现代化的轻工业生产就不能进行。因此，国家的重工业部门应当为轻工业提供更多的原料、材料、燃料，有关部门应当进行周密的组织工作，不断地检查，保证这些原料的生产和调拨计划的完满实现。
    轻工业企业要积极挖掘本身潜力，更广泛更深入地开展合理节约原材料、提高出品率的群众运动，并尽量利用废品和代用品。在这个方面，轻工业部门过去做了很多工作，效果也很大，但目前潜力还是很大的。在各种产品制造中，原料材料的平均消耗定额和先进消耗定额之间，还有相当距离。拿造纸工业来讲，先进单位造一吨纸，用纸浆九百公斤左右，而一般单位却用一千一百公斤左右，如果把平均消耗定额降低10％，今年利用现有原料就可以增产三十万吨纸。在纺织工业中，适当提高棉纱支数，也可以节约原料，多纺纱，多织布。当然，节约原料材料，提高出品率，任何时候都必须以保证产品的质量为前提，才符合党的社会主义建设总路线的要求。
