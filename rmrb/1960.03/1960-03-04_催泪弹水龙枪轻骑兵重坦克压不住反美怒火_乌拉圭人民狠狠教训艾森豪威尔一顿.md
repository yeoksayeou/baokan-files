Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Montevideo dispatch: The Uruguayan people yesterday at noon greeted U.S. President Eisenhower, who arrived in Uruguay for a visit, with slogans of "Yankee Imperialists Get Out of Latin America!" "Long Live the Cuban Revolution!" and anti-American demonstrations.

After Eisenhower entered the city from the airport, he and his entourage traveled by car from the U.S. Embassy along the streets of the capital, Montevideo, to the government building. When passing the Architecture College of the University of Uruguay, students unfurled a huge banner with the words: "Yankee Imperialists Get Out of Latin America!" "Long Live the Cuban Revolution!" The students also chanted "Cuba! Cuba!" Police and firefighters rushed into the Architecture College and snatched the banner.

As Eisenhower's entourage approached the front of the University of Uruguay's main campus, hundreds of students in the school and on the streets shouted, "Cuba! Cuba!" and distributed leaflets against U.S. imperialism, hanging a huge banner of "Oppose Imperialism" at the school gate. When Eisenhower's car sped past the school gate, the shouts became louder, and leaflets rained down. Police began throwing tear gas and using fire hoses to spray the demonstrators. At this time, Eisenhower abandoned his usual practice of standing on the car with his arms outstretched to greet people, and sat down to avoid the tear gas. Nevertheless, he was still attacked by tear gas and his eyes teared up. According to Reuters, "Almost everyone in the convoy following Eisenhower's car was attacked by tear gas at the (University) Law School entrance, and like Eisenhower, their eyes were red," and "When the U.S. President later greeted members of the Uruguayan government, his eyes were clearly still sore."

According to United Press International, fearing another anti-American demonstration by students when passing in front of the university again, Eisenhower changed his route when going to the Uruguayan government banquet in the evening, and detoured around those remote streets. After the banquet, his car still dared not pass through the main streets, but could only travel through some back streets and alleys.

On the night of the 2nd, a large number of soldiers, police, armored vehicles, and tanks were deployed around the U.S. Embassy, where Eisenhower spent the night. Police dogs were also dispatched for guard duty, and fire engines and hydrants were prepared to deal with demonstrators at any time.

The Uruguayan University Student Federation issued a statement saying that they protested Eisenhower's visit because Eisenhower is "a representative of Wall Street economic groups and colonial capitalists, not a representative of the American people."

According to U.S. news agencies, to protect Eisenhower's safety during his visit to Uruguay, 8,000 army, navy, and air force personnel were deployed, accounting for more than three-quarters of the Uruguayan armed forces. This included cavalry, light and heavy tanks, military vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, and light field artillery, as well as police and firefighters.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Montevideo dispatch from Latin American News Agency: When U.S. President Eisenhower's convertible car passed through the main street of the Uruguayan capital – July 18th Avenue – on the afternoon of the 2nd, a tar ball was thrown at him. The tar ball did not hit its target because it hit a tree on the sidewalk.

The tar ball was thrown from a building as Eisenhower's motorcade passed.

This was the third demonstration against him and against U.S. imperialism encountered by U.S. President Eisenhower within the first three hours of his stay in Montevideo.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Montevideo dispatch: Just as Eisenhower was attending a banquet hosted by the President of the Uruguayan Council of State, Nadone, nearly 2,000 Uruguayan university students held an anti-imperialist conference at the University of Uruguay, condemning the U.S. imperialist policy towards Latin America. This conference was organized by the Uruguayan University Student Federation.

Speakers at the conference included Martinez, Secretary-General of the Uruguayan University Student Federation, as well as representatives from the Latin American July 26th Movement and the Executive Committee of the Uruguayan Workers' United Union (formerly the United Center of Laboring People). Speakers accused U.S. imperialism of being the root cause of poverty and underdevelopment for the people of Latin America. They condemned the interference of the U.S. authorities and the International Monetary Fund in Latin American countries.

Speakers pointed out: Eisenhower's visit was to encircle Cuba. U.S. imperialism is trying to repeat the Guatemalan incident in Cuba. Speakers all expressed support for the Cuban revolution and emphasized the achievements made by Cuba, especially land reform.

They said that Cuba's path is the path of Latin America. They also called on the people of all Latin American countries to unite and follow this path.

The nearly 2,000 students who participated in the conference constantly shouted "Long Live Cuba" and "Long Live Land Reform." After the conference, the students still gathered in front of the university gate. Police tried to disperse them with tear gas, but they continued to shout slogans such as "No Yankees, Yes Cuba!" "Yankees Go Home!"

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Montevideo dispatch: Uruguayan public opinion strongly condemns U.S. interference in Cuba and points out that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of all countries on the South American continent. The Uruguayan University Student Federation and the Argentine University Student Federation issued a joint statement saying: "We students and people do not welcome the U.S. President. We oppose him to oppose the policies of the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Big Trusts. We want to shout out our true feelings about imperialism: 'We don't like it,' and Mr. Ike is an outstanding representative of this imperialism." "We oppose the representatives of the Trusts and the (U.S.) State Department because U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of the people of all countries on our continent today."

The Executive Committee of the Uruguayan Workers' United Union, composed of various trade union organizations, issued a statement saying, "We demand respect for the right of the Cuban people to decide their own destiny, to stop the criminal bombings from U.S. territory, and to stop the slanderous and rumor-mongering propaganda campaign against the Cuban revolution."

On the 2nd, when Eisenhower passed the University of Uruguay in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, Uruguayan university students launched a large anti-American demonstration. The Uruguayan authorities dispatched troops and police to suppress it.

The students and the military police launched a heroic fight. The police officer in white and black pants in the front right is being held down by the students. Police and firefighters used water cannons to spray the demonstrating students.

    催泪弹水龙枪轻骑兵重坦克压不住反美怒火
    乌拉圭人民狠狠教训艾森豪威尔一顿
    新华社3日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭人民昨天中午用“美帝国主义滚出拉丁美洲！”“古巴革命万岁！”的口号和反美示威接待了到达乌拉圭访问的美国总统艾森豪威尔。
    艾森豪威尔从机场进城后，和他的随行人员乘车从美国大使馆沿着首都蒙得维的亚的街道去到政府大厦。当经过乌拉圭大学建筑学院时，学生们打开了一幅巨大的横幅标语，上面写着：“美帝国主义滚出拉丁美洲！”“古巴革命万岁！”学生们同时还高呼“古巴！古巴！”警察和救火员冲进建筑学院，抢走了这幅标语。
    艾森豪威尔一行快要经过乌拉圭大学校本部的门前时，学校里和街道上的几百名学生高呼：“古巴！古巴！”并且散发了反对美帝国主义的传单，在学校门前挂起了一幅“反对帝国主义”的巨大标语。当艾森豪威尔的汽车疾驰经过学校大门的时候，人们的叫声更加响亮，传单像雨点般地撒下来。警察开始投掷催泪弹，并用救火水龙射击示威者。艾森豪威尔这时放弃了站在车上展开双手向人们致意的一贯作法，坐下来躲避催泪弹。尽管如此，他还是遭到了催泪瓦斯的袭击而两眼流泪。据路透社报道，“几乎所有跟随在艾森豪威尔汽车后面的车队上的人都在（大学）法学院门口受到催泪瓦斯的袭击，而且也像艾森豪威尔一样弄得眼睛通红”，“美国总统在后来向乌拉圭政府成员们致意时，他的眼睛显然还很难受”。
    据合众国际社消息，由于害怕再次经过大学门前重新遭遇学生们的反美示威，艾森豪威尔在傍晚前往参加乌拉圭政府宴会时改变了行车路线，而绕行那些偏僻的街道。宴会以后，他的汽车仍然不敢从大街经过，而只能从一些后街小巷穿行。
    2日夜在艾森豪威尔过夜的美国大使馆周围布下了大批军警和装甲车、坦克，同时出动了警犬参加警戒，并且准备了救火车和水龙头准备随时对付示威者。
    乌拉圭大学生联合会发表声明说，他们抗议艾森豪威尔的这次访问，因为艾森豪威尔是“华尔街经济集团和殖民主义资本家的代表，而不是美国人民的代表。”
    据美国通讯社报道，这次艾森豪威尔到乌拉圭访问，为了保护他的安全，曾经出动了八千名陆、海、空军，占乌拉圭武装部队的四分之三以上。其中包括骑兵、轻重坦克，配备着重机枪、火箭炮和轻型野战炮的军用车，还有警察和救火员。
    新华社3日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社蒙得维的亚消息：当2日下午美国总统艾森豪威尔的敞篷汽车经过乌拉圭首都的主要街道——7月18日大道时，一颗沥青弹投向了他，这颗沥青弹由于撞在人行道的一颗树上而没有击中目标。
    这颗沥青弹是在艾森豪威尔的车队经过时由一个大厦上投下来的。
    这是美国总统艾森豪威尔在蒙得维的亚逗留的最初三小时内所遇到的第三次反对他本人和反对美帝国主义的示威。
    据新华社3日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：正当艾森豪威尔出席乌拉圭国务会议主席纳多内招待宴会的时候，将近两千名乌拉圭大学生在乌拉圭大学里举行了反对帝国主义大会，谴责美国对拉丁美洲的帝国主义政策，这次大会是由乌拉圭大学生联合会组织的。
    在大会上发言的有乌拉圭大学生联合会总书记马丁内斯以及拉丁美洲7月26日运动和乌拉圭工人统一工会（前译劳动人民统一中心）执行委员会的代表。发言者指责美帝国主义是拉丁美洲人民贫困和不发达的根源。他们谴责了美国当局和国际货币基金组织对拉丁美洲国家进行的干涉。
    发言者指出：艾森豪威尔的访问是为了包围古巴。美帝国主义企图在古巴重演危地马拉事件。发言人都表示支持古巴革命，强调指出了古巴所获得的成果，特别是土地改革。
    他们说，古巴的道路就是拉丁美洲的道路。他们还要求拉丁美洲各国人民团结起来走这条道路。
    参加大会的近两千名学生不断高呼“古巴万岁”，“土地改革万岁”。大会结束后，学生们仍聚集在大学门前。警察力图用催泪瓦斯把他们驱散，可是他们继续高呼“不要美国佬，要古巴！”“美国佬滚回去！”等口号。
    据新华社3日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭公众舆论强烈谴责美国对古巴的干涉，并指出美帝国主义是南美大陆各国的主要敌人。乌拉圭大学生联合会和阿根廷大学生联合会发表联合声明说：“我们学生和人民不欢迎美国总统，我们以反对他来反对美国国务院和美国大托辣斯的政策。我们要大声疾呼地道出我们对帝国主义的真实感情：‘我们不喜欢它’，而艾克先生正是这个帝国主义的出色的代表。”“我们反对托辣斯和（美国）国务院的代表，因为美帝国主义是目前我们大陆各国人民的主要敌人。”
    由各工会组织组成的乌拉圭工人统一工会执行委员会发表声明说，“我们要求尊重古巴人民决定自己命运的权利，停止来自美国领土的罪恶轰炸，停止对古巴革命的诽谤和造谣的宣传运动。”

    2日，当艾森豪威尔在乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚乘车路经乌拉圭大学时，乌拉圭大学生展开了反美大示威。乌拉圭当局出动军警镇压。
    学生们和军警展开了英勇的搏斗，右前穿白衣黑裤的是被学生扭住蹲下的警察。警察和救火员用水龙喷射正在示威的学生。
