　　　　Allocate Summer Harvest Tools in Complete Sets Early
　　　　Qihe County Can Basically Achieve Semi-Mechanization of Harvesting, Transportation, Threshing and Storage

　　(Our Report) Qihe County, Shandong Province, with the spirit of getting an early start and striving for initiative, mobilized the masses and organized county and commune industries two months ago, launching a movement to innovate summer harvest tools in complete sets. Currently, 16,438 pieces of eight types of semi-mechanized tools have been successfully manufactured, modified, and imitated, including scissor-type wheat harvesters, wheat rapid harvesters, wide-bladed long-handled sickle, horse-drawn trains, blower threshers, lever multi-tread threshers, field-starting machines, and grain-starting conveyors. These tools are used for the main processes of wheat from harvesting and transportation to threshing and storage.

　　These modified tools have been repeatedly tested and evaluated by cadres, workers, and experienced farmers. They increase efficiency by four to eight times, and are low in cost and easy to manufacture. The scissor-type harvester created by workers Wang Zhongshan and Sun Chuanli of the Sangzi Commune Iron and Wood United Factory consists of eight main parts: twenty pairs of scissors, a whirlwind wheel, a figure-eight wheel, a driving rail, an eccentric wheel, a wooden frame, a releasing device, and a brake handle. One person and one animal can harvest eight mu of wheat per day, increasing work efficiency seven times compared to harvesting with a sickle. The wheat rapid harvester modified by worker Wang Rongwen of the County Wood Factory consists of three parts: two 40-centimeter-long scissors, a fork frame, and a wooden handle. One person can harvest four mu of wheat per day, increasing work efficiency three times, and the cost is only four yuan. The wide-bladed long-handled sickle created by commune member Jiang Liantang of the Jiangtang Production Team of Jiaomiao Commune has only two parts: a 40-centimeter-long and 3-centimeter-wide blade and a 1.3-meter-long wooden handle. The cost is 2.5 yuan, and one person can harvest five mu of wheat per day, increasing work efficiency four times. The field-starting machine modified by worker Nie Yiyun of the Da Wu Commune Iron and Wood Factory is made entirely of wood. Even half-labor can operate it, increasing work efficiency five times compared to a regular wooden fork. The grain-starting conveyor created by worker Wang Yunxiang of the Qiguan Commune Machinery Factory has six parts: a wooden frame, a conveying bag, a wooden bucket, a rocking wheel, a rocking handle, and an iron shaft. Three people operating it can convey 20,000 jin of wheat per hour, increasing work efficiency five times, and women and children can operate it. These advanced tools are being vigorously promoted throughout the county. Each people's commune plans to have one advanced harvesting tool for every 40 mu of wheat, one threshing tool for every 200 mu, and one advanced transportation tool for every 150 mu before the "May Day" holiday. According to this requirement, a total of 25,180 of these eight types of tools will be manufactured, so that the county's wheat harvesting, transportation, threshing and storage can basically achieve semi-mechanization. It is estimated that more than 723,000 labor days can be saved, and it can be achieved to harvest wheat in seven days and thresh it in ten days.

　　This county is a wheat-producing area in southwestern Shandong. This year, it has a total wheat field area of ​​850,000 mu. The Qihe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed to the people of the county two months ago the call to get an early start and strive for the initiative, make a big fuss about the reform of summer harvest tools, and resolutely pass the wheat harvest. And the secretary of the county party committee in charge of industry took the lead, forming a professional leading group, going deep into the workshops, and studying technology with the workers to overcome difficulties. The eighteen iron and wood factories and more than 1,700 workers of the county and commune also enthusiastically joined this movement. After the full promotion, the county selected 65 of the highest-skilled technicians and formed eight technical research groups according to the types of tools to strengthen specific guidance, and successively held three on-site meetings for visits and exchange of experience.

### 把夏收工具提早配成套  齐河县收割、运输、脱粒、入仓可基本实现半机械化

    把夏收工具提早配成套
    齐河县收割、运输、脱粒、入仓可基本实现半机械化
    本报讯　山东省齐河县各人民公社本着早动手争主动的精神，在两个月以前就发动群众，组织县社工业，掀起一个成套革新夏收工具的运动。目前已赶制、改制、仿制成功剪刀式小麦收割机、小麦快速收割器、宽刃长把删镰、马拉列车、鼓风脱粒机、杠杆多?打场器、起场机、起粒传运机等八种半机械化工具共计一万六千四百三十八件，把小麦从收割、运输到脱粒入仓等主要工序，用先进工具配起了套。
    这些改制工具经过干部、工人和老农反复试验鉴定，分别提高效率四至八倍，而且成本低、制造简便。桑梓公社铁木联合厂的工人王忠山、孙传礼等人创造的剪刀式收割机，是由二十把剪刀、旋风轮八字轮、代动轨、偏心轮、木架、离开器、闸把等八个主要部件组成，一人一畜每天能割小麦八亩，比用镰刀收割提高工效七倍。县木厂工人王荣文改制的小麦快速收割器，由四十厘米长的剪刀两个、杈架、木把三个部件组成，一人操作每天能割麦四亩，提高工效三倍，成本只有四元。焦庙公社姜堂生产队社员姜连唐创造的宽刃长把删镰，只有四十厘米长、三厘米宽的刀片和一个一米三的长木把两个部件，造价二元五角，一人一天割麦五亩，提高工效四倍。大吴公社铁木厂工人聂一云改制的起场机，全部为木质品，半劳力也能操作，比一般木杈提高工效五倍。七官公社机械厂工人王云祥创造的起粒传运机，有木架、转送袋、木斗、摇轮、摇把、铁轴六个部件，三人操作每小时传运小麦二万斤，提高工效五倍，而且妇女、儿童都能操作。这些先进工具正在全县大力推广。各人民公社计划在“五一”节前，达到每四十亩小麦有一件先进收割工具，二百亩有一件脱粒工具，一百五十亩有一件先进运输工具。按照这个要求，这八种工具，共要制造二万五千一百八十部，使全县小麦收割、运输、脱粒入仓基本实现半机械化，预计可以节约劳动工日七十二万三千多个，并可以做到七天收完麦，十天脱完粒。
    这个县是鲁西南的产麦地区，今年共有麦田面积八十五万亩，中共齐河县委早在两个月以前就向全县人民提出了早动手争主动、大闹夏收工具改革，坚决过好小麦收获关的号召。并且由县委管工业的书记挂帅，组成专业领导小组，深入车间，与工人们一起研究技术，突破难关。县社十八个铁木工厂、一千七百余名工人，也热烈的投入了这一运动。在全面推广之后，全县抽调了六十五名技术最高的技工，按工具种类分别组成八个技术研究小组加强具体指导，并先后召开了三次现场会议，进行参观，交流经验。
