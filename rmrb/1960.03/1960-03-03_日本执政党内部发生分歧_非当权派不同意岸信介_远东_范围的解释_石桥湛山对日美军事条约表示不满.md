    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 1st: Disagreements have emerged within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party as non-mainstream factions prepare to challenge the Kishi Nobusuke group's "unified interpretation" of the "Far East" region as it applies to the new "Security Treaty."

    On February 26th, Kishi Nobusuke issued a so-called "unified interpretation" of the "Far East" scope, stating that the "Far East" region generally encompasses the area north of the Philippines and Japan and its surrounding regions, including the area ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek clique and South Korea under the rule of the Syngman Rhee clique. Today, Kishi Nobusuke, in response to questioning from a Socialist Party member during the House of Representatives Budget Committee, reiterated that "Quemoy and Matsu Islands are also included within the scope of the so-called Far East." He said, "If a war breaks out there, it will be directly related to the peace and security of Taiwan."

    According to Japanese newspapers today, key members of the Ishii faction, Ishibashi faction, Matsumura-Miki faction, and Ikeda faction within the Liberal Democratic Party held a joint meeting on February 28th. A member of the Matsumura-Miki faction stated at the meeting that including Quemoy and Matsu Islands in the "Far East" scope would be detrimental to breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations and would carry the risk of drawing Japan into war.

    Reports indicate that most of those attending the meeting agreed with this view and decided to submit the issue for discussion at the Liberal Democratic Party's General Council meeting.

    According to the "Asahi Shimbun" today, former Japanese Prime Minister and prominent figure in the Liberal Democratic Party's non-mainstream faction, Tanzan Ishibashi, is "very dissatisfied" with the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The newspaper stated that Ishibashi recently told the press that Japanese political figures must reconsider whether signing a treaty that runs counter to the trend of international détente and inevitably worsen Japan's relations with the Soviet Union and China is a wise diplomatic policy for Japan.

    The newspaper stated that Ishibashi has deep concerns about issues such as the operational areas for US troops stationed in Japan, the definition of "Far East," and matters related to "prior consultation" within the new "Security Treaty."

    According to reports, the "Kinshukai," centered around the Kono faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, also held a meeting on February 29th to discuss the scope of the so-called "Far East" and the Kishi Nobusuke group's insistence that the Diet has no right to amend the treaty in order to pass the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." Many members at the meeting expressed disagreement with the "Far East" scope as interpreted by Kishi Nobusuke and argued that the Diet has the authority to set conditions on the treaty.

    日本执政党内部发生分歧
    非当权派不同意岸信介“远东”范围的解释
    石桥湛山对日美军事条约表示不满
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党内的非当权派准备就岸信介集团对于新“安全条约”适用范围“远东”地区所作的“统一解释”提出异议。
    岸信介在2月26日发表所谓“远东”范围的“统一解释”说，“远东”地区大体上是菲律宾以北和日本及其周围地区，包括蒋介石集团统治地区和李承晚集团统治下的南朝鲜。今天，岸信介在众议院预算委员会上回答社会党议员质询时再次肯定说：“金门和马祖岛也包括在所谓远东范围之内”。他说，“如果在这里发生战争，就会同台湾的和平和安全直接发生关系”。
    据日本报纸今天报道，自由民主党内的石井派、石桥派、松村—三木派和池田派的主要议员在2月28日举行联席会议。松村—三木派的议员在会上说，“远东”范围包括金门和马祖岛，对于打开日中关系僵局是不好的，并且有使日本卷进战争的危险。
    消息说，出席这次会议的大部分人都表示同意这个意见，并且决定把这个问题提交自由民主党总务会会议讨论。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，日本前首相、自由民主党非当权派中的重要人物石桥湛山对新日美“安全条约”“十分不满”。这家报纸说，石桥最近对报界说，日本政界人士必须重新考虑：同国际局势缓和的趋势背道而驰，签订这项不可避免地将使日本同苏联和中国的关系恶化的条约，是不是日本的明智的外交政策。
    报纸说，石桥对新“安全条约”中关于驻日美军的出动地区、“远东”的定义、关系到“事先协商”的问题等，深感不安。
    据报纸透露，自由民主党内以河野派为中心的“锦水会”也在2月29日举行会议，就所谓“远东”范围和岸信介集团为了使国会通过新日美“安全条约”而硬说国会无权修改条约的问题进行了讨论。许多议员在会上对岸信介所解释的“远东”范围表示异议，并且认为国会对条约有保留条件的权限。
