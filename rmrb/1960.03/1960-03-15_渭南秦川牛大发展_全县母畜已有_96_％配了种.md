Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 12th: Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, famous for producing Qin Chuan cattle, has achieved another great success in livestock breeding this year, building on the basis of continuous great leaps forward in livestock production for the past two years. By the end of February, 96% of the female livestock that should have been bred in the county had been bred.

　　As soon as this spring arrived, the leading departments of the Party and government in Weinan County launched an "early start and three grasps" early spring breeding campaign in all people's communes in the county. "Early" means starting early, breeding early, and birthing early. "Three grasps" means grasping full pregnancy of female livestock; grasping breeding technology, implementing re-breeding, continuous breeding, and artificial insemination; grasping time, launching a massive campaign, and completing breeding within a set time limit. As a result of adopting the above methods, the breeding group has been expanded, and more breeding and more production has been achieved.

　　Last year, the number of large livestock in Weinan County increased by 10.4% compared with 1958, and fifteen livestock full-pregnancy management areas, such as Dashen and Xiagui, and nine hundred-mother-hundred-calf production teams emerged. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Production Team has achieved hundred-mother-hundred-calf for three consecutive years, and the net increase rate of large livestock reached 31.8% last year. This county has many measures and good methods in the management, breeding, and mating of large livestock.

　　First, they adhere to putting politics in command, and through propaganda and education, they establish the ambition of striving for large-scale and high-yield production of large livestock among the masses. Every spring, they launch a mass breeding campaign, which has a very good effect. Second, strengthen leadership, establish role models, and establish fine breed breeding bases. In order to solve the shortage of breeding livestock and improve the quality of breeding livestock, they selected 75 excellent Qin Chuan cattle and 430 fine breed female livestock through head-by-head appraisal, and the communes built fine breed breeding farms, and the production teams established breeding groups. The county also established 15 artificial insemination stations, achieving a station in every commune.

　　Second, taking Guandao Commune as the key point, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Team as the banner, and Zhang Xingrong, a national model breeder, as the role model, through on-site meetings, organizing visits, study, visits, roving lectures, master-apprentice teaching, and regular evaluations and competitions, the vigorous development of the large livestock breeding campaign in the county was promoted.

　　Third, improve breeding methods and increase breeding efficiency. The methods of artificial estrus induction, artificial insemination, centralized breeding, and the centralized use of breeding livestock, female livestock, estrus-inducing drugs, breeding equipment, and breeding technicians are adopted to speed up breeding speed, improve breeding quality, and eliminate empty pregnancy of female livestock.

　　Fourth, improve the feeding and management system. Implement the methods of contracting breeding, contracting investment, contracting work points, and fixing personnel, fixing troughs, fixing number of heads, fixing fatness, and fixing feed, and implement excess rewards.

　　At present, the people of Weinan County are still deeply carrying out the work of mating large livestock, and are determined to achieve full pregnancy of large livestock in the county in March.

    渭南秦川牛大发展
    全县母畜已有96％配了种
    新华社西安12日电　盛产秦川牛的陕西省渭南县在连续两年获得牲畜大跃进的基础上，今年的大家畜配种工作又夺得了开门红。到2月底全县应配的母畜，已有96％配了种。
    今年春季一到，渭南县的党和政府的领导部门就发动全县各人民公社开展“一早三抓”的早春配种运动。“早”就是早动手、早配、早生。“三抓”即抓母畜满怀；抓配种技术，实行复配、连续配、人工授精；抓时间，大搞突击，限期配完。由于采用了以上办法，扩大了繁殖群，达到了多配多产。
    渭南县去年大家畜比1958年净增10．4％，并出现了大什、下邽等十五个牲畜满怀管理区，九个百母百仔生产队，中苏友好生产队连续三年实现百母百仔，去年大牲畜净增率达到31．8％。这个县在大家畜的管理、繁殖、配种方面，措施多，办法好。
    他们首先是坚持政治挂帅，通过宣传教育在群众中树立争取大牲畜大面积丰产的雄心大志。每年春季都大搞群众性的配种突击运动，效果很好。其次，加强领导，树立标兵，建立良种繁育基地。为了解决种畜不足和提高种畜质量，他们通过逐头鉴定，选出优良秦川牛七十五头，良种母畜四百三十头，社建成了良种繁育场，生产队建立了选育群。全县还建立人工授精站十五处，达到了社社有站。
    第二是以官道公社为重点，以中苏友好队为旗帜，以全国模范饲养员张兴荣作标兵，通过现场会、组织参观、留学、访问、巡回讲演、师傅带徒弟，定期评比竞赛，促进了全县大牲畜配种运动的蓬勃开展。
    第三，改进配种方法，提高配种效率。采用人工催情，人工授精，集中配种，以及种畜、母畜、催情药物、配种器械、配种技术人员集中使用的办法，加快配种速度，提高配种质量，消灭母畜空怀。
    第四，改进饲养管理制度。推行包繁殖、包投资、包工分，和定人员、定槽、定头数、定膘色、定饲料办法，并实行超额奖励。
    目前，渭南县人民还在深入开展大家畜配种工作，决心在3月份内实现全县大牲畜满怀。
