Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 29th: Guangdong Province's industrial and transportation fronts are continuing to vigorously realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations and the elimination of heavy physical labor. At the same time, they are focusing on solving new problems brought about by the large-scale introduction of new equipment into production, such as insufficient electricity, raw materials, and technical forces, so as to ensure the continuous and high-speed development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

The technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization has only been launched in Guangdong Province for more than a month, but the speed of the movement's development and the magnitude of its effects have surpassed previous production movements over the past few years. By mid-March, a total of more than 43,900 innovations had been made in the province to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and a large number of new mechanized, semi-mechanized, and even basically automated and semi-automated workshops and factories have emerged.

With the realization of a large number of innovation projects, new imbalances have emerged in Guangdong's industrial production. The main manifestations are that after a large number of new technologies and new equipment were put into production, the demand for electricity, fuel, and raw materials increased sharply, and the technical level of workers could not adapt to the requirements of the new technologies for a while. To this end, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly proposed to continue to focus on the mechanization of manual operations and the elimination of heavy physical labor as the main direction of attack, and at the same time focus on solving the contradiction of insufficient supply of electricity, fuel, and raw materials, that is, to use the principle of "one main and two auxiliary, comprehensive innovation" as the guiding ideology for the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement, so as to ensure the continued high-speed development of this movement.

The workers and staff in various places who have achieved great victories in the previous stage of technological innovation have responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, promoted the spirit of continuous revolution, and adopted the method of taking materials locally and relying on their own efforts to vigorously overcome the barriers of electricity, fuel, and raw materials, and have achieved immediate results. In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient power supply after the improvement of the degree of mechanization, Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhanjiang, Maoming and other cities have recently combined the technological innovation movement to promote the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience and launch a mass movement to run power. After Guangzhou promoted the "four-in-one" ring power supply, it reduced the load by 13,000 kilowatts in February alone, effectively supporting production. In the emerging industrial city of Maoming, the use of road rollers, wind power, car heads, train heads and biogas power generation has been successful, and preliminary statistics show that the newly added power is equal to more than half of the city's existing power generation.

The innovation movement carried out around the issue of raw materials and fuels has also achieved remarkable results. The factories in the southern district of Guangzhou, where the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization first reached more than 70%, carried out a comprehensive innovation movement to comprehensively utilize raw materials, and extracted or manufactured more than 100 kinds of products from waste gas, waste liquid and other raw materials in more than half a month. The city's building materials industry has also adopted methods such as taking materials locally and comprehensively utilizing shavings, sawdust, and wood chips to produce a batch of new products such as activated carbon and plastic sheeting.

After a large number of new technologies and new equipment were put into production, various places generally adopted the method of carrying out large-scale technical performance competitions and launching communist cooperation to accelerate the improvement of workers' technical level. Guangzhou, which started earlier, combined technical transformation by industry to carry out technical performance competitions, transferred veteran technicians and workers who can skillfully operate new equipment, formed technical medical teams and mobile service teams, went to various factories to carry out technical performances according to the type of work, and widely taught and helped ordinary workers master new technologies. At present, more than 10,000 workers in the city have participated in the study.

Due to the timely resolution of new imbalances in the movement in various places, the large number of new technologies and new equipment that appeared in the previous stage have been fully utilized, thus ensuring the completion of current production tasks and creating favorable conditions for the sustained and high-speed development of the technological revolution movement.

    发扬革新精神　大抓新问题
    广东及时解决技术革命带来的新问题，保证运动持续高速度地发展
    据新华社广州29日电　广东省工业、交通运输战线在继续大力实现手工操作机械化半机械化和消灭笨重体力劳动的同时，抓紧解决由于大批新设备投入生产而带来电力、原料材料和技术力量不足的新问题，使技术革新和技术革命运动不停息地向前发展。
    以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动在广东省开展只有一个多月，但是运动发展之快，效果之大，都超过了过去几年的历次生产运动。到3月中旬止，全省实现手工操作机械化半机械化操作的革新共达四万三千九百多项，出现了大批新的机械化半机械化以至基本上自动化半自动化的车间和工厂。
    随着大量革新项目的实现，广东省工业生产上出现了新的不平衡。主要表现是，大批新技术新设备投入生产之后，引起了对电力、燃料、原料材料等需要量的急剧增加，还出现了工人技术水平一时不能适应新技术要求的现象。为此，中共广东省委及时提出了继续以手工操作机械化和消灭笨重体力劳动为主攻方向，同时抓紧解决电力、燃料、原料材料供应不足的矛盾，即以“一主二辅、全面革新”的方针作为当前技术革新和技术革命运动的指导思想，以保证这一运动继续高速度地向前发展。
    已经取得前一阶段技术革新巨大胜利的各地职工，纷纷响应省委的号召，发扬不断革命精神，采用就地取材、自力更生的办法，猛攻电力、燃料和原料材料关，并且获得了立竿见影的效果。广州、佛山、湛江、茂名等市，为了解决机械化程度提高后电力供应不足的矛盾，最近都结合技术革新运动，推行“四合一”环形供电经验和发动全民办电。广州市推行“四合一”环形供电以后，在2月份一个月中便压缩负荷一万三千瓩，有效地支援了生产。在新兴工业城市——茂名市，已利用压路机、风力、汽车头、火车头和沼气发电成功，初步统计新增加的电力等于全市现有发电量的一半以上。
    围绕原料材料和燃料问题而开展的革新运动，也已经取得了显著成就。广州市机械化半机械化程度最先达到70％以上的南区各工厂，开展了全面综合利用原料材料的革新运动，在半个多月之内就从废气、废液和其他原料材料中提炼或制成产品一百多种。全市建筑材料行业也采用就地取材、综合利用刨花、木糠、碎木等办法，制成了活性炭、胶板等一批新产品。
    在新技术新设备大量投入生产以后，各地普遍采取大搞技术表演赛和开展共产主义协作的办法，加速提高工人的技术水平。动手较早的广州市，结合按行业进行技术改造，普遍开展了技术表演赛，抽调老技工和能熟练操作新设备的工人，组成技术医疗队、流动服务队，到各厂按工种进行技术表演，广泛地传授和帮助普通工人掌握新技术。现在全市已有一万多名工人参加学习。
    由于各地及时解决运动中出现的新的不平衡，使前一阶段出现的大批新技术新设备充分发挥了效能，因而保证了当前生产任务的完成，并且为技术革命运动的持续高速度发展创造了有利条件。
