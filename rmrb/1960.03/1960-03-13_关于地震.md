    About Earthquakes
    Liu Feng
    According to a report in the People's Daily on the 4th of this month: A major earthquake occurred in Agadir, southwestern Morocco, on the 1st, destroying about 90% of the buildings in the city's suburbs and about 70% of the buildings in the city's prosperous areas. After the earthquake, the tide surged into the city, and news reports say that the estimated death toll had reached five to six thousand people by the 3rd. We express our deep sympathy to these suffering people.
    Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural forces on Earth. In an instant, the energy generated by the vibration is often equivalent to the amount of energy it would take the world's largest hydroelectric power station many years to produce.
    During major earthquakes, huge cracks often appear on the ground, which can be hundreds of kilometers long. The land on both sides of the cracks also shifts position, either forward, backward, upward, or downward. Once an earthquake occurs, sometimes mountain peaks collapse.
    Faced with such enormous destructive power, rulers throughout history have always been at a loss. They could only prostrate themselves and pray to be spared from disaster. On the 19th day of the eighth month of the eighth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty, an earthquake occurred in Beijing. Two months later, the emperor issued an edict that read: "Probably an earthquake indicates that I have committed transgressions, so heaven is sending a warning." There are also many places in the "Bible" that use earthquakes to frighten people.
    In fact, earthquakes are not to be feared. Like all natural forces, they follow a certain pattern, and once we understand the pattern, we can be unafraid.
    Why do earthquakes occur?
    We now know that the main reason for earthquakes is the continuous movement of substances inside the earth, which under certain conditions causes the earth's crust to fracture and shift. This is like the foundation of a house shaking, which of course will produce vibrations. In addition, volcanic eruptions and ground subsidence can also cause earthquakes. The reason for ground subsidence is usually due to the activity of groundwater, which causes cavities to appear in the earth's crust and continuously expand. When they become so large that the roof cannot support them, they collapse. Limestone areas have many karst caves, so these types of earthquakes are more common.
    Where is it easiest for fractures to occur? That is in the most active parts of the earth's crust. No place on Earth has ever stopped moving, but some are stronger and some are weaker. Earthquakes are a manifestation of strong activity, as are volcanoes, so they often occur together.
    When we study the geological conditions of various places and grasp the laws of crustal movement, we can roughly know where an earthquake may occur and the possible intensity it may reach, and take preventive measures in advance. We can also use methods such as strengthening buildings to prevent destruction, so that we will not suffer major losses.
    In the future, we will also move from defense to offense, so that earthquakes can also serve humanity. This is possible. Soviet scientists are now envisioning how to slowly release the energy possessed by earthquakes and use it to generate electricity. Man will conquer nature, and in our struggle with earthquakes, there should be no exception.

    关于地震
    柳风
    据本月4日人民日报报道：摩洛哥西南部阿加迪城在1日发生了大地震，使这个城市郊区约90％的建筑物和城市繁华区约70％的建筑物被毁。在地震之后，海潮又涌入这个城市，有消息说，估计死亡的人数在3日已达到五、六千人。对这些受难的人民我们表示深切的同情。
    地震是地球上破坏性最大的一种自然力，在一刹那间，震动所生的能量，往往要世界上最大的水电站工作许多年才能得到。
    在大地震发生时，地面常常出现巨大的裂缝，可以长达数百公里，裂缝两边的土地还错动了位置，或向前、或向后、或上升、或下陷。地震一旦发生，有时山峰也会崩塌。
    面对着这样巨大的破坏力，历史上的统治者们总是张皇失措。他们只能顶礼膜拜，祈求免祸。清雍正八年八月十九日北京发生了地震。两个月以后，皇帝发出的一道上谕中便这样说道：“大概地动，即系朕有过愆，所以上天示惩。”在“圣经”中也有不少地方利用地震来恐吓人民。
    其实地震并不可怕，和一切自然力一样，它也是有规律可寻的，在我们掌握规律以后就可以不怕它了。
    为什么会发生地震呢？
    现在我们已经知道，发生地震的主要原因是由于地球内部物质不断运动，在一定的条件下使地壳断裂错动，这时就像房屋的基础动摇，当然要产生震动。除此以外，火山喷发，地层塌陷都可以引起地震。地层塌陷的原因通常是由于地下水的活动，使地壳中出现洞穴并不断扩大，当大到洞顶支持不住时就塌陷了。石灰岩地区溶洞多，这类地震也就较多。
    什么地方最容易发生断裂呢？那就是地壳最活动的部分。地球上任何一处地方都没有停止过运动，但有强有弱，地震就是强烈活动的表现，火山也是如此，因而它们常伴生在一起。
    当我们对各处的地质情况进行研究，掌握了地壳运动的规律以后，就能大体上知道某个地区可能发生地震和可能达到的强烈程度，事先采取预防措施；还可以用加固建筑物等办法来防止破坏，这样就不会遭受重大的损失了。
    我们将来还要从防御转入进攻，使地震也为人类服务。这是可能的。现在苏联科学家已在设想使地震所拥有的能缓缓放出，用来发电。人定胜天，在我们和地震的斗争中，也应该不例外。
