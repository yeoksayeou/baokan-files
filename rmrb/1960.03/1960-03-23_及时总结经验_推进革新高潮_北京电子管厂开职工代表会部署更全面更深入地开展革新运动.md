    Promptly Sum Up Experience and Promote a New Upsurge of Innovation
    Beijing Electronic Tube Factory Holds Employee Representative Meeting to Deploy a More Comprehensive and In-Depth Innovation Movement

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing Electronic Tube Factory held an employee representative meeting on the 19th to sum up the experience of carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement since the beginning of this year. It was proposed to carry out this movement more comprehensively, systematically, and deeply, striving to seize a complete victory in the second quarter's production, based on the fact that it has already completed the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way.

    The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory employee representative meeting affirmed the achievements of the factory in carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement since the beginning of this year, and summarized the basic experience of the movement, which is: holding high the red flag of continuous revolution, fully mobilizing the masses; launching targeted and intensive "campaigns" in stages on the basis of making full preparations in ideological, organizational, and technical aspects; after the "campaign," promptly grasping the identification and promotion of technical innovation projects, so that the movement can be consolidated, popularized, and improved, and at the same time, making preparations for the next "campaign."

    The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory is a large modern enterprise with a high degree of mechanization. On the basis of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution last year, the entire factory has set off a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on realizing production automation, linkage, and remote control. Since February, the factory has realized 3,440 technical innovation projects, and there are 334 automation, linkage, and remote control projects, of which 308 have been put into production. The factory's production outlook has rapidly changed, and output has continued to increase significantly. The output in January this year increased by 2% compared with December last year, and February increased by 16.3% compared with January. A lot of manpower, operating area, and equipment have been saved.

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement of this factory is carried out by organizing "campaigns" in stages. Two "campaigns" have been organized this year. The specific approach is: first, mobilize all employees of the factory to carry out ideological revolution, break superstitions, establish the idea of continuous revolution, and solve various specific ideological problems. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the general factory, branch factories, workshops, work sections, and groups adopt the method of "from the masses, to the masses," and formulate technical innovation plans at all levels (first formulate long-term plans, and then formulate short-term plans for phased assaults). According to the key problems in current production, they put forward clear directions and specific goals for each "campaign," as well as the measures and time for realization. In this way, all employees of the factory are fully mobilized, pooling their wisdom and efforts, and attacking towards clear goals. The materials, drawings, and manpower allocation required for carrying out the "campaign" are also fully prepared before the "campaign" by relying on our own efforts, so that everyone is responsible for every item, and every item is guaranteed by measures.

    The factory's technical innovation "campaign" is arranged once a month, and each time lasts about ten days. The main methods of each "campaign" are: 1. Generally, everyone participates in realizing general projects, and major projects are completed by organized professional assault teams, and the two are closely combined to promote each other. 2. Under the principle of emphasizing self-reliance, vigorously carry out intra-factory collaboration to solve technical strength, materials, equipment, and other problems. All departments regard collaboration as one of the conditions for competition and evaluation. 3. When the "campaign" reaches a certain stage, hold large-scale evaluation and comparison "production sports meetings," where all employees of the factory conduct large-scale technical performances, observe each other, and further promote the realization and promotion of technical innovation projects, and achieve a large-scale harvest in production. 4. Leading cadres at all levels go to the front line to promptly solve specific problems in the heated struggle of the masses and boost morale. 5. Use various forms to do a good job in publicity and mobilization, exchange experience, and boost morale.

    After each "campaign," the factory immediately conducts appraisal, consolidation, and promotion of technical innovation projects to ensure rapid use in production. The factory has established a technical appraisal committee, and each branch factory and workshop has established a "three-in-one" appraisal team composed of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to appraise each technical innovation project item by item. Projects that pass the appraisal are immediately organized to put into production; projects with some shortcomings are studied and improved by the appraisal personnel and the employees who carry out the innovation, and put into production within a limited time. Projects that have passed the appraisal are vigorously promoted by means of visits, performances, or opening technical training classes. According to the new situation in the realization and promotion of technical innovation projects, the factory also actively improves management work, such as revising technology, revising quotas, and improving labor organization, so as to consolidate the achievements of the technical revolution from the management perspective. The factory has recently revised seventy-eight technological regulations. At the same time, the factory also summarizes each "campaign" from bottom to top and prepares for the next "campaign."

    The factory's summary pointed out that the process of carrying out "campaigns" in stages is a process of continuous repetition and spiral upward movement of "preparation - climax - summary, consolidation, and improvement." In this way, the technical innovation movement is carried out vigorously and practically, and develops forward in waves, constantly pushing production to new heights, reflecting the idea of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development.

    Through summarizing the technical innovation and technical revolution movement since the beginning of this year at this employee representative meeting, all the representatives have more confidence and greater enthusiasm. The conference decided to further push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on automation, linkage, and remote control to a newer climax, and strive to solve more than 100 important production key problems before "May Day," to realize 177 automation, linkage, and remote control projects, to form seven automated workshops and five remote-controlled groups, and to further improve the mechanization level of fitters, foundry workers, and forging workers. Now, all employees of the factory have made preparations for the third technical innovation "campaign." (Attached picture)

    及时总结经验　推进革新高潮
    北京电子管厂开职工代表会部署更全面更深入地开展革新运动
    本报讯　北京电子管厂19日举行职工代表大会，总结了今年以来开展技术革新和技术革命运动的经验，提出要更全面更系统更深入地开展这一运动，争取在已经提前全面完成第一季度生产计划的基础上，夺取第二季度生产满堂红。
    北京电子管厂职工代表大会肯定了这个厂今年以来开展技术革新和技术革命运动的成就，总结了运动的基本经验，这就是：高举不断革命思想的红旗，充分发动群众；在作好思想、组织、技术等各方面充分准备的基础上，分阶段发起目标明确的突击性的“战役”；“战役”结束后抓紧进行技术革新项目的鉴定、推广工作，使运动得到巩固、普及和提高，同时作好下一“战役”的准备工作。
    北京电子管厂是一座现代化的大企业，机械化程度较高。全厂在去年大搞技术革新和技术革命的基础上，今年掀起了一个以实现生产自动化、联动化、遥控化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮。2月份以来，全厂便实现了三千四百四十个技术革新项目，自动化、联动化、遥控化项目有三百三十四项，其中已有三百零八项投入了生产。全厂生产面貌迅速改观，产量不断大幅度上升。今年1月份的产量比去年12月增长2％，2月份比1月份增长16．3％。人力、作业面积、设备都节省了很多。
    这个工厂的技术革新和技术革命运动，是以分期组织“战役”的方法进行的。今年已组织了两次“战役”。具体的作法是：首先发动全厂职工进行思想革命，破除迷信，树立不断革命的思想，解决各种具体的思想问题。在思想认识提高的基础上，总厂、分厂、车间、工段和小组，采用“从群众中来，到群众中去”的方法，层层制订技术革新规划（首先制订长远规划，再制订分期突击的短期规划），根据当前生产中的关键问题，提出每次“战役”的明确方向和具体奋斗目标，以及实现的措施和时间等。这样，就把全厂职工充分地动员了起来，群策群力，向着明确的目标进攻。开展“战役”中需要的材料、图纸设计以及人力配备等，也都在“战役”前，用自力更生的办法充分做好准备，做到项项有人负责，项项有措施保证。
    这个工厂的技术革新“战役”每月安排一次，每一次的时间十天左右。每次“战役”的主要作法是：一、一般项目人人动手实现，重大项目组织专业突击队完成，两者紧密结合，互相促进。二、在强调自力更生的原则下，大搞厂内协作，解决技术力量、材料、设备等问题。各个部门都把协作作为竞赛评比条件之一。三、在“战役”进行到一定阶段时，举行大评大比的“生产运动会”，全厂职工进行技术大表演，互相观摩，进一步促进技术革新项目的实现和推广，取得生产的大面积丰收。四、各级领导干部亲临前线，在群众火热的斗争中，及时解决具体问题，鼓舞士气。五、利用各种形式，做好宣传鼓动工作，交流经验，鼓舞斗志。
    这个工厂在每次“战役”结束后，立即对技术革新项目进行鉴定、巩固和推广工作，保证迅速用于生产。全厂成立了技术鉴定委员会，各分厂、车间分别成立了领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”鉴定小组，对各项技术革新项目逐项鉴定。鉴定合格的项目，随即组织力量投入生产；某些还有缺点的项目，便由鉴定人员和进行革新的职工一起研究改进，限期投入生产。经过鉴定合格的项目，便用参观、表演或开技术训练班等办法大力推广。根据实现和推广技术革新项目中的新情况，这个厂还积极改进管理工作，如修改工艺，修订定额，改进劳动组织等，从管理上巩固技术革命的成果。全厂最近已修订了七十八项工艺规程。与此同时，全厂还自下而上地对每次“战役”进行总结，并进行下一次“战役”的准备工作。
    这个工厂的总结中指出，分阶段进行“战役”的过程，是“准备——高潮——总结巩固提高”不断反复螺旋上升的过程。这样，就使技术革新运动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，一浪高一浪地向前发展，不断把生产推向新的高峰，体现了不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的思想。
    这次职工代表大会通过总结今年以来的技术革新和技术革命运动，全体代表信心更足，干劲更大。大会决定进一步把以自动化、联动化、遥控化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动推向更新的高潮，力争在“五一”以前解决一百多项重要的生产关键，实现自动化、联动化、遥控化项目一百七十七项，组成七个自动化车间、五个遥控化小组，进一步提高钳、铸、锻工的机械化程度。现在，全厂职工已经作好第三次技术革新“战役”的准备工作。（附图片）
