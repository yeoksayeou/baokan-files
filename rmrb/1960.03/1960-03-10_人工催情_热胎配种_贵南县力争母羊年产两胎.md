    Artificial Insemination, "Hot Pregnancy" Mating
    Guinan County Strives for Two Lambing Seasons Per Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining: Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, is seizing the current lambing season to launch large-scale artificial insemination and "hot pregnancy" mating work, striving for more ewes to produce two litters a year. At present, among the county's more than 120,000 lambing ewes, more than 89,000 healthy ewes of appropriate age have undergone estrus induction and mating after lambing. Among them, 49,689 ewes have conceived.
    The practice of ewes lambing twice a year has already been tested as a key experiment by the Guinan County Party Committee in the Zhihe Brigade of the Maying Commune. The brigade formed seven groups of 1,505 healthy ewes of appropriate age, and used pregnant mare urine, pregnant mare serum, refrigerated pregnant cattle blood, etc. for artificial estrus induction injections after they lambed to stimulate the ewes to come into heat and mate early. These ewes produced 2,020 lambs in about a year, with 2,005 surviving. After the experiment, the Guinan County Party Committee promptly summarized and promoted the brigade's experience, and launched an activity for ewes to be mated twice a year throughout the county. At present, the communes are seizing the opportunity to perform estrus induction and immediate mating on every healthy ewe of appropriate age after she gives birth.

    人工催情  热胎配种
    贵南县力争母羊年产两胎
    新华社西宁讯　青海省海南藏族自治州贵南县抓紧当前羊羔生产季节，大规模展开人工催情和热胎配种工作，争取更多的母羊一年产两胎。目前，全县十二万多只产羔母羊中，已有八万九千多头适龄健壮的母羊，在产后进行了催情和配种。其中，已有四万九千六百八十九只母羊受孕怀羔。
    母羊一年产两胎已经中共贵南县委在马营公社的直核大队作过重点试验。这个大队将一千五百零五只适龄健壮母羊组成七个群，在它们产羔后用孕马尿、孕马血清、孕牛冷藏血等作人工催情注射，刺激母羊提前发情交配。这些母羊在一年左右的时间内，产羔二千零二十只，成活二千零五只。试验后，中共贵南县委及时总结和推广了这个大队的经验，在全县展开母羊一年两配的活动。目前，各公社正在抓紧时机，对适龄健壮母羊做到产一只就催情热配一只。
