River water ascends the mountain, a thousand dragons, ten thousand dragons,
Head to tail, connecting to the summit,
Opening their mouths to spout rivers and seas,
Filling the mountains and plains with gurgling sounds,
Even in drought years, we will transform it into a year of abundance,
The People's Commune holds the universe in its palm.

    河水上山千条龙，万条龙，首尾衔接上高峰，张口喷出江海水，满山遍野响淙淙，旱年也要变丰年，人民公社掌乾坤。
