    Always Be a Gardener of New Things
    Di Linjie, Secretary of the CPC Committee of Xi'an People's Enamel Factory

    Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, like all enamel factories in the country, used to be a factory mainly based on manual operation. The degree of mechanization was very low, and the labor intensity was very high. There was a popular saying among the workers: "Working in the enamel industry is eating youth's meals." This situation not only hindered the improvement of workers' working conditions but also affected the improvement of productivity. Therefore, quickly getting rid of manual operation and changing the backwardness of production has long been the urgent desire of the broad masses of workers. Under the shining of the Party's general line for building socialism and inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers and masses liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and established the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to practice. This desire was even more clearly expressed. Many people not only talked about and looked forward to the beautiful prospect of changing manual operation to mechanization, automation, and electrification in ordinary times, but also put it into action. Some were pondering how to reform each tool and each process, and some even drew diagrams and made models. In this way, a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution aimed at transforming the enterprise was vigorously launched in our factory.

    The history of production development is the history of producers constantly carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in production practice and improving labor productivity. Science and technology come from practice, and the innovation of production tools and the improvement of technical level are also the products of production practice. We clearly understand that only the workers and masses are most familiar with production, understand the problems in production best, and have rich operational technical experience and infinite wisdom. Therefore, we should always enthusiastically support the innovation suggestions from the masses, clear the way for them, and create conditions for their growth. We should not only enthusiastically support the relatively mature innovation suggestions put forward by the workers, but also enthusiastically support many immature, flawed, and even seemingly just beautiful "fantasy" suggestions, giving them ideological encouragement, material and time convenience, and organizing forces to help and support them technically. In this way, not only were those relatively mature innovation suggestions realized in time, but also some immature, imperfect, and even "fantasy" suggestions were partially adopted and applied after summarization and integration. For example, the scientific research project of the high-frequency electric heating enamel furnace planned in 1959 came from a suggestion put forward by an old worker in the machine repair workshop to change the production of the enameling workshop to electrical production in the future. He envisioned that in the future, a person would stand next to the electric furnace to send iron blanks, and the iron blanks would automatically rotate in the furnace, and after automatic enameling, baking, scraping, and printing, the finished products would come out of the furnace. This "fantasy" suggestion, after analysis and research, and discarding the crude and retaining the essence, was of great help to everyone.

    The Party organization's support for new things is also manifested in caring for and supporting them in many ways when they suffer setbacks, encounter difficulties, or temporarily fail. Last year, in order to change the most important process of enameling from manual operation to mechanical operation, and then drive the overall innovation of other processes, and realize the call of the Party Committee: "Mechanization and automation of operation, diversification and artisticization of products," the workers, after more than a month of hard work, built an automatic rotary table baking furnace. When this rotary furnace was first put into production, there were some problems in the structure of the furnace, the furnace temperature could not meet the requirements, and the workers had not fully mastered the operating rules of the automatic furnace, and there was a phenomenon of product falling off the shelf, burning and stopping. Originally, a new thing is often imperfect and immature when it first appears, and even has some shortcomings, especially some complex and cutting-edge innovation suggestions, the situation is even more so. Therefore, it needs a growth process of constantly overcoming shortcomings, solving one difficulty after another, and gradually achieving perfection. At this moment, the Party organization immediately emphasized to everyone that the baking furnace can automatically rotate, can burn out products, and reduce the physical labor intensity of workers, which is a great victory. Encourage everyone not to be discouraged, work hard, and find experience and lessons from the existing problems. The responsible comrades of the factory also personally went to the front line of production and worked with the workers and technicians to study the causes of the problems and solve them one by one. After some efforts, the problems of the rotary furnace were quickly overcome. Later, the workers changed "single baking and single burning" to "double baking and double burning," and the production efficiency increased linearly, from 3,700 to 7,500, which was more than six times higher than the original manual operation. This matter has greatly educated the workers and masses and the leaders. It made the workers and masses see their wisdom and strength, and also made the leaders more determined to have a mass viewpoint and support the confidence of new things. It made us deeply realize that any new thing, although it seems very young and even insignificant in its initial stage of germination, it is precisely here that many great innovations and creations are conceived, and it has a strong vitality and is fully capable of overcoming difficulties and overcoming unfavorable conditions to grow and develop. The responsibility of the leaders is to always stand on the side of new things, enthusiastically support and cultivate them, and provide them with conditions for growth. Only in this way can we always advance with new things and be full of youthful vitality.

    Our era is an era of creating miracles. New things of technical innovation, like blooming flowers in spring, are blooming more and more and more beautifully under the nurturing of the east wind. In the past, we only did a little bit of the work that a gardener should do; in the future, we are determined to do this work better and fulfill the responsibilities that a gardener should fulfill.

    永远作新生事物的园丁
    中共西安人民搪瓷厂委员会书记　邸林杰
    西安人民搪瓷厂和全国所有的搪瓷工厂一样，以前也是一个以手工操作为主的厂子，机械化程度很低，劳动强度很大，职工中流行有一句话：“干搪瓷行业是吃壮年饭”。这种情况不但妨碍职工劳动条件的改善，而且影响生产力的提高。因此，迅速摆脱手工操作，改变生产上的落后面貌，早就成为广大职工群众长期以来的迫切愿望。职工群众在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的八届八中全会的精神鼓舞下，解放了思想，破除了迷信，树立了敢想、敢说、敢于实践的共产主义风格，这种愿望就更为明显地表现了出来，许多人不仅在平时谈论着和憧憬着把手工操作改为机械化、自动化、电气化的美好远景；而且见之于行动。有的琢磨着如何对每一件工具、每一道工序进行改革，有的还画了图、作了模型。这样，一个以改造企业为目标的技术革新和技术革命的高潮，就在我们厂里蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    生产发展的历史，是生产者自己在生产实践中不断进行技术革新和技术革命、提高劳动生产率的历史。科学技术来自实际，生产工具的革新和技术水平的提高，也是生产实践的产物。我们清楚地了解到：只有职工群众最熟悉生产，最了解生产中的问题，有着丰富的操作技术经验和无穷的智慧。因此，我们对于来自群众的革新建议，始终都应该满腔热情的加以支持，为它们扫清道路，创造成长的条件。我们不只应该热情支持工人提出的比较成熟的革新建议，而且也应该热情支持许多不成熟、有缺点、甚至在当时看来仅仅是个美好的“幻想”的建议，给他们以思想上的鼓励，物质和时间上的方便，并且在技术上组织力量予以帮助和支援。这样，就不仅使那些比较成熟的革新建议及时得到了实现，而且也使一些不成熟、不完善、甚至一些带有“幻想”的建议，经过归纳综合之后，也部分地得到了采纳应用。例如1959年规划的高频电热烧搪炉的科学研究项目，就是根据机修车间的一个老工人提出的将来把搪烧车间的生产改为电气化生产的建议而来的。他设想将来一个人站在电炉旁边送铁坯，铁坯就在炉里自动转动，经过自动涂琅、烘烧、刮边、打印，成品就从炉口出来。这个带有“幻想”的建议，经过分析研究、去粗存精后，对大家的帮助很大。
    党组织对于新生事物的支持，还表现在当它受到挫折、遇到困难或暂时失败的时候，从多方面加以关怀、扶植。去年，为了把搪烧方面最主要的工序，由手工操作改为机械操作，进而带动其它工序的全面革新，实现党委提出的：“操作机械化、自动化、产品多样化、艺术化”的号召，职工们经过一个多月的奋战，建成了一座自动转盘烘烧炉。这转炉刚投入生产时，炉子结构上有些毛病，炉温达不到要求，加上工人还没有完全掌握自动炉的操作规律，一度发生产品掉架、时烧时停的现象。本来，一个新事物在它刚出现的时候，常常是不完善不成熟，甚至存在有一些缺点的，特别是一些复杂的、带有尖端性的革新建议，情况就更为如此。因此，它需要一个不断克服缺点，解决一个又一个困难，逐步达到完善的成长过程。党的组织在这个时刻立即向大家着重说明了烘烧炉能自动转起来，能烧出产品，减轻工人的体力劳动强度，这就是很大的胜利。鼓励大家不要泄气，好好干，从存在问题中，找经验教训。厂的负责同志还亲自深入到生产第一线和工人、技术人员一起，研究毛病产生的原因，一个又一个地加以解决。经过一番努力之后，转炉的毛病很快克服了。后来，工人又把“单烘单烧”改为“双烘双烧”，生产效率直线上升，由三千七百个一跃而为七千五百个，比原来手工操作提高了六倍以上。这件事，对职工群众和领导的教育很大，它使职工群众看见了自己的智慧和力量，也使领导更加坚定了群众观点和支持新生事物的信心。它使我们深刻体会到，任何一件新生事物尽管在它萌芽的初期，看来是很幼小的，甚至是微不足道的，可是正是在这里面孕育着许多伟大的革新创造，并且具有强大的生命力，完全能够克服困难，战胜不利条件而成长壮大。领导的责任就是要永远站在新生事物一边，满腔热情地支持和培植它，为它提供成长的条件。只有这样，才能永远和新生事物一起前进，充满青春的活力。
    我们的时代是一个创造奇迹的时代，技术革新的新生事物，就像春天盛开的鲜花一样，正在东风的抚育下越开越多，越开越艳。过去，我们仅只是作了一个园丁应作的一点小小的工作；今后，我们有决心把这方面的工作做得更好一些，尽到一个园丁应尽的责任。
