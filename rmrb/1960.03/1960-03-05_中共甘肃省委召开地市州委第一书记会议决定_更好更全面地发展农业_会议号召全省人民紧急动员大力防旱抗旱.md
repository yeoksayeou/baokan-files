This newspaper reports: The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of first secretaries of prefectural, city, and autonomous prefectural Party committees from February 6 to 9. The meeting focused on discussing the current situation and the issue of high-speed, proportional development of the national economy, especially the issue of developing agricultural production better and more comprehensively with agriculture as the foundation.

The meeting believed that the current international and domestic situation is excellent. Gansu Province, like all parts of the country, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, achieved high-speed and proportional development of the national economy in 1959, and all aspects showed a thriving scene. This year, we continue to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward of 1959. Industrial production has seen a good start, winter water conservancy has achieved great results, the mass movement of "Great increase in production without rain, great harvest in the event of a severe drought" is continuing to develop, and people's communes in various regions, after rectification, have embarked on a path of healthier development, playing an even greater role in the current drought prevention and resistance movement.

The meeting emphasized that the decisive key to realizing a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward this year is to strengthen the agricultural front and implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. The fundamental issue of high-speed and proportional development is the agricultural issue. If agriculture does not develop, the development of industry will be restricted. Taking agriculture as the foundation and rapidly developing agriculture, together with giving priority to the development of heavy industry, are mutually conditional, mutually combined, and mutually promoting. Developing agriculture and accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture will consolidate and develop the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis. The people's communes have promoted and will further promote the development of agricultural productive forces, and the high-speed growth of agriculture is also more conducive to the further improvement and development of the people's communes. In Gansu, taking agriculture as the foundation has special significance. The meeting demanded that all Party comrades should strive to grasp agriculture, and the first secretaries of prefectural, city, autonomous prefectural, and county Party committees should devote themselves to grasping agriculture.

On how to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation in the Gansu region, the meeting proposed: First, vigorously carry out water conservancy construction, implementing the policy of "emphasizing storage, diversion, and lifting together, combining large, medium, and small, with small as the foundation and large as the backbone." Second, selectively realize agricultural mechanization and universally and extensively carry out the movement of tool reform. In the Hexi and Dongzhiyuan regions, selectively realize agricultural mechanization, while other regions mainly engage in tool reform and semi-mechanization. Third, increase production and seize land reclamation. All parts of the province should try every means to increase yield per unit area, and in the three reclamation areas of Hexi, Gannan, and Ziwuling in Pingliang Prefecture, seize land reclamation. Fourth, vigorously develop animal husbandry, implementing the principle of raising both pigs and sheep, while also developing large livestock, especially cattle farming. Fifth, do everything possible to support agriculture. Industrial, scientific, cultural, educational, health departments and all walks of life should do their best to support agriculture, especially the industrial sector should pay more attention. The meeting pointed out: The current urgent task is to call on the whole Party and all the people to urgently mobilize, deeply carry out the drought prevention and resistance movement, and achieve "Great increase in production without rain, great harvest in the event of a severe drought." The drought prevention and resistance movement should proceed on two fronts: on the one hand, arrange the people's lives well, earnestly inspect and rectify the work of the communes, and effectively carry out the rectification work, adjusting the relationships well; in conjunction with the rectification work, do a good job in profit distribution, food arrangements, and overproduction rewards; on the other hand, vigorously grasp water conservancy and production measures, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, further give play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, and vigorously carry out the drought prevention and resistance movement.

The meeting pointed out that this year's drought situation has been largely confirmed. Therefore, it is an urgent task to grasp the work of drought prevention and resistance in a down-to-earth manner. The current task is to "cultivate well and plant well, preserve seedlings to ensure harvest." The central link of "cultivating well and planting well, preserving seedlings to ensure harvest" is to grasp water conservancy and resolutely implement the policy of "emphasizing storage, diversion, and lifting together, combining large, medium, and small, with small as the foundation and large as the backbone." At present, we must pay special attention to lifting irrigation, which can produce immediate results. Gansu Province has abundant underground water resources. Whether it is the Loess Plateau in the east, the arid mountainous areas in the central region, the Hexi Basin, or the mountainous areas in the south, there is abundant underground water available for irrigation. We should vigorously promote the well-digging experience of Baiyin City, Dongzhiyuan, and the Hexi Basin, and mobilize the masses to dig wells for irrigation in all water-scarce areas. This is a very reliable drought prevention and resistance measure. At the same time, we must implement lifting irrigation on the high terraces along the Yellow River, Bailong River, Tao River, Jing River, Wei River, and other rivers, making full use of river water. We must also earnestly carry out storage and diversion projects, first seizing the projects that can be irrigated currently, carrying out crash construction, and irrigating while building. All regions should earnestly check the winter irrigation and spring irrigation situation, and special emphasis should be placed on actual irrigation. At the same time, we should also grasp the drought prevention and resistance work in high-altitude mountainous areas and shady and humid areas, and mobilize the masses in a planned way to plant crops well in these areas, preparing for a bumper harvest even in the event of a severe drought. For arid mountainous areas that are neither shady and humid nor high-altitude, and are also short of water, in addition to engaging in groundwater, soil and water conservation, sand paving, and water storage projects, small collectives can also be organized to create small, high-yielding plots as insurance fields. In addition, each prefecture has some areas with better conditions, such as the Hexi Corridor, the banks of the Wei River, the Bailong River basin, the Ziwuling area, and parts of Linxia and Gannan, which should try to increase production as much as possible.

In order to ensure "Great increase in production without rain, great harvest in the event of a severe drought," the meeting called on the people of the province, in addition to vigorously grasping water conservancy, to launch a "100-jin potato, 100-jin pumpkin" movement, requiring all production teams of all people's communes in the province, in addition to completing the prescribed production plans, to mobilize all commune members to use the front and back of houses, courtyard open spaces, and private plots to plant potatoes and pumpkins, striving for each laborer to harvest an extra 100 jin of potatoes and 100 jin of pumpkins. Urban factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, schools, and troops should all participate in this movement. Potatoes and pumpkins planted by farmers belong to those who plant them, and the products planted by factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, schools, and troops are handed over to the canteen, and the output value belongs to individuals. In addition to participating in this movement, factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, schools, and troops should also do a good job in building non-staple food bases. In order to effectively grasp this work, the meeting required that factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, schools, and troops should all appoint a responsible comrade to arrange the lives of the masses, grasp the production of non-staple foods, support agricultural production and drought prevention and resistance, and other tasks.

In view of the severe drought situation this year, the meeting required Party committees at all levels to take a series of measures in the drought prevention and resistance movement: such as doing a good job in ideological education for the broad masses, overcoming paralysis and complacency and lack of confidence, and establishing the idea that man can conquer nature; doing a good job in the rectification and distribution work of the communes, and arranging the lives of the masses; implementing the water conservancy policy, vigorously carrying out the water conservancy movement, and fully utilizing underground water resources; distinguishing land and planting according to local conditions, taking different measures for different land; mobilizing all walks of life to support the drought prevention and resistance movement, and so on.

The meeting required Party committees at all levels to improve their leadership methods, further combine leadership with the masses, and properly follow the mass line. Agricultural production and drought prevention and resistance work should be grasped tightly, ruthlessly, deeply, and meticulously.

    中共甘肃省委召开地市州委第一书记会议决定
    更好更全面地发展农业
    会议号召全省人民紧急动员大力防旱抗旱
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委于2月6日至9日举行地、市、州委第一书记会议。这次会议着重讨论了当前形势和高速度按比例发展国民经济问题，特别是以农业为基础、更好更全面地发展农业生产的问题。
    会议认为当前国际国内形势非常好。甘肃省和全国各地一样，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，1959年国民经济获得了高速度按比例发展，各方面都呈现了欣欣向荣的景象。今年在1959年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。工业生产出现了开门红的大好局面，冬修水利获得了很大成绩，“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”的群众运动正在持续发展，各地人民公社经过整顿，走上了更加健全发展的道路，在当前的防旱抗旱运动中，发挥着更为巨大的作用。
    会议强调指出，实现今年更好更全面的继续跃进的决定关键是加强农业战线，贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针。高速度按比例发展的根本问题是农业问题，农业不发展，工业的发展，就要受到限制。以农业为基础，迅速发展农业，同优先发展重工业，是互为条件、互相结合、互相促进的。发展农业，加速农业的技术改造，就会在新的基础上巩固和发展工农联盟。人民公社促进了并且将更大地促进农业生产力的发展，农业高速度地增长，也更有利于人民公社的进一步提高和发展。在甘肃以农业为基础，更有特殊意义。会议要求全党同志都要努力抓农业，地、市、州委和县委第一书记应当全力抓农业。
    在甘肃地区如何贯彻以农业为基础的方针，会议提出必须：一、大搞水利建设，实行“蓄引提并举，大中小结合，小型为基础，大型为骨干”的方针。二、有重点地实现农业机械化，普遍地大量地搞工具改革运动。在河西和董志塬地区，有重点地实现农业机械化，其他地区主要搞工具改革和半机械化。三、提高产量、抓紧农垦。全省各地都要千方百计提高单位面积产量，在河西、甘南和平凉专区的子午岭等三个垦区，要抓紧垦荒。四、大力发展畜牧业，实行猪羊并举，同时要发展大牲畜，特别是养牛事业。五、尽力支援农业。工业、科学、文教、卫生部门和各行各业都要尽力支援，特别是工业部门更要重视。会议指出：当前的迫切任务就是要号召全党全民紧急动员起来，深入开展防旱抗旱运动，实现“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”。防旱抗旱运动要两条腿走路，一方面要安排好群众生活，认真检查整社工作，把整社工作切实搞好，调整好关系；结合整社工作，做好收益分配、粮食安排和超产奖励等工作；另一方面要大抓水利，大抓生产措施，充分调动广大群众的积极性，进一步发挥人民公社的无比优越性，大力开展防旱抗旱运动。
    会议指出，今年大旱局势已大体肯定，因此，把防旱抗旱工作扎扎实实地抓起来，是刻不容缓的任务，当前就是要“耕好种好，保种保出”。“耕好种好，保种保出”的中心环节，是抓紧水利，坚决贯彻“蓄引提并举，大中小结合，小型为基础，大型为骨干”的方针。目前要特别注意提升灌溉，提升灌溉可以立竿见影。甘肃省地下水源十分丰富，不论东部黄土高原地区，中部的干旱山区，河西盆地或南部山区，都有丰富的地下水可供灌溉。应当大力推广白银市、董志塬和河西盆地的打井经验，在所有缺水地区，发动群众打井灌溉，这是一个很可靠的防旱抗旱措施。与此同时，要在黄河、白龙江、洮河、泾河、渭河等沿河沿江高台地，实行提升灌溉，充分利用河水。对蓄引工程也要认真进行，首先抓紧当前能够灌溉的工程，突击修建，边修边灌。各地应认真检查冬灌和春灌情况，要特别强调实灌，抓紧实灌。同时还应抓紧高寒山区和阴湿地区的防旱抗旱工作，有计划地发动群众，把这些地区的庄稼种好，准备在大旱的情况下，也可以大丰收。对于既非阴湿，又非高寒，又缺水的干旱山区，除搞地下水、水土保持、铺沙，蓄水等工程外，还可以小集体为单位，搞小块丰产方，作为保险田。此外，各专区都有一些条件较好的地区，如河西走廊、渭河沿岸、白龙江流域、子午岭地区以及临夏和甘南的部分地区，应当设法多增产一些。
    为确保“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”，会议号召全省人民，除大抓水利外，还要开展一个“百斤洋芋，百斤南瓜”的运动，要求全省各人民公社所有的生产队，在完成规定的生产计划以外，应发动所有社员，利用房前屋后、院内空地和自留地种植洋芋和南瓜，争取每个劳力多收百斤洋芋、百斤南瓜。城市工矿、企业、机关、学校、部队都应参加这个运动。农民群众种植的谁种归谁，工矿、企业、机关、学校、部队种植的，产品交食堂，产值归个人。工矿、企业、机关、学校和部队除参加这一运动外，还应把副食品基地搞好。为了把这项工作切实抓起来，会议要求工矿、企业、机关、学校、部队都要指定一个负责同志安排群众生活，抓副食品生产，支援农业生产和防旱抗旱等工作。
    鉴于今年旱象严重，会议要求各级党委在防旱抗旱运动中，采取一系列措施：如做好广大群众的思想教育工作，克服麻痹大意和信心不足的现象，树立人定胜天的思想；做好整社分配工作，安排好群众生活；贯彻水利方针，大搞水利运动，充分利用地下水源；区别土地，因地种植，对不同土地采取不同措施；发动各行各业，支援防旱抗旱运动等等。
    会议要求各级党委改进领导方法，更进一步地使领导和群众结合起来，好好走群众路线。对于农业生产和防旱抗旱工作要抓紧、抓狠、抓深、抓细。
