Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Your Excellency, Friends:

	I am truly delighted to have this opportunity to visit China, thanks to the warm invitation from Your Excellency and the Chinese government. The hospitality of this great nation is world-renowned. The friendly and warm welcome you extended to us in Guangzhou yesterday and here this afternoon fully demonstrates the noble sentiments, warm friendship, and respect you hold for our friendly neighbor, Nepal, and its people. I would like to take this pleasant opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for the warm welcome extended to me and my entourage. Indeed, this warm welcome symbolizes your profound goodwill towards Nepal and the Nepalese people.

	The friendly relations between Nepal and China can be traced back thousands of years. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal in 1955 greatly strengthened our friendly relations. At the same time, we firmly believe that in the years to come, we will further strengthen and consolidate the friendship between our two peoples. In promoting and strengthening friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries, I believe that the best and most important way is through direct contact and frequent exchange of views. People from our two countries have already begun official and other mutual meetings. I believe that if this pleasant state of affairs is further strengthened and improved, it will lead to further satisfactory development of the friendly relations between our two countries. It is precisely for this reason that I hope my visit to China will further strengthen the bonds of friendship between our two countries.

	The establishment of China's new social order has become a matter of great attention and interest to everyone; this is especially true for those who have good wishes for China and for China's friendly neighbors. As a neighbor and friend of the Chinese people, I am very eager to come to China to observe and understand the construction work being carried out under your country's new social system. Therefore, I am very happy to arrive here today and realize my wish. China is a large country, but until recently, it was still a relatively underdeveloped country. Therefore, the problems your country faces are not dissimilar to those faced by other relatively underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa. The construction plans formulated by your country to solve these problems, and the achievements your country has made in these plans, are worthy of our serious study. During my visit to China, I will try my best to study and understand your country's construction plans and progress. I believe that doing so will greatly benefit and assist me in formulating plans for the construction and development work of my own country.

	China and Nepal have different political systems in managing state affairs, but the policies of striving for world peace and universal friendship, as well as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which our two countries implement, are very similar. Both of our countries deeply understand that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and peace are extremely necessary for the progress of all countries in the world. For the sake of our country's interests and the world's interests, we have been doing our best in this regard. At the same time, I firmly believe that we are willing to work even harder for world peace and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

	I would like to convey to the Chinese government and the Chinese people the message of friendship and goodwill from His Majesty the King of Nepal, the Nepalese government, and the Nepalese people. Finally, I would like to thank you again for your warm welcome and hospitality.

	Glory to China!
	Glory to Nepal!
	Long live Sino-Nepalese friendship!

    柯伊拉腊首相的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理，阁下，朋友们：
    由于阁下和中国政府热情的邀请，我有这样一个机会访问中国，心里的确感到非常高兴。这个伟大国家的好客是世界驰名的，你们昨天在广州和今天下午在这里所给予我们的友好而亲切的欢迎，充分显示了你们对于友好邻邦尼泊尔及其人民所怀有的崇高的感情，亲切的友谊和尊重。我愿借此愉快的机会向您表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们对我和我的随行人员的热烈欢迎；的确这种热烈的欢迎象征着你们对尼泊尔和尼泊尔人民的深厚的善意。
    尼泊尔和中国之间的友好关系，可以追溯到几千年以前。1955年中尼两国外交关系的建立，大大加强了我们之间的友好关系；同时我们深信，在未来的岁月里，我们将进一步加强和巩固两国人民之间的友谊。在促进和加强两国友谊与相互了解方面，我认为，最好和最重要的办法就是直接接触和经常交换意见。我们两国的人，已经开始了官方的以及其他方面的相互会晤。我相信，这种令人愉快的事如果予以进一步的加强和改进，将会导致我们两国友好关系的更进一步的、令人满意的发展。正是由于这个原因，我希望我这次访问中国将会进一步加强我们两国友谊的联系。
    中国的新社会秩序的建立，已经成为大家极为注意和感兴趣的事了；对于对中国怀有良好愿望的人和对于中国的友好邻邦来说，情况更是如此。作为中国人民的一个邻居和朋友，我很希望来到中国，来考察和了解贵国新的社会制度下所进行的建设工作。因此，当我今天到达这里、实现了我的这一愿望的时候，我感到非常高兴。中国是一个大国，尽管如此，迄至不久以前，它还是一个比较不发达的国家。因此，贵国所面临的问题，同亚洲非洲其他比较不发达的国家所面临的问题，并不是不相似的。贵国为了解决这些问题而制定的建设计划，以及贵国在这些计划中所取得的成就，是值得我们认真研究的课题。在我这次访华期间，我将设法尽最大的可能来研究和了解贵国的建设计划和进展情况，我相信，这样做将会大大有利于和有助于我制定我自己的国家的建设和开发工作的计划。
    中国和尼泊尔在管理国事方面有着不同的政治制度，但是我们两国所执行的争取世界和平和普遍友好的政策以及和平共处五项原则，是很相近似的。我们两国都深知和平共处五项原则和和平，对于世界上一切国家的进步，是极为必需的。为了我国的利益和世界的利益，我们一直在为此尽出我们的最大努力。同时，我深信，我们愿意为了世界和平与和平共处的五项原则而更加努力地工作。
    我谨向中国政府和中国人民转达尼泊尔国王陛下，尼泊尔政府和人民的友谊和亲善的音讯。最后，我愿再次向诸位表示感谢，感谢你们的热烈欢迎和热情款待。
    光荣属于中国！
    光荣属于尼泊尔！
    尼中友谊万岁！
