    Drought Resistance Short Songs

    We're not afraid of no rain,
    We've got a locomotive boiler to run the show;
    It opens its mouth, "doo-doo-doo,"
    A silver dragon climbs straight into the wheat field.
    
    Spring planting is as hot as fire,
    Red flags flutter, heat waves roll;
    People cheer, cattle leap, sounds everywhere,
    "The East is Red" gallops, chasing the wind.
                Shen Yan
    
    Set up a marker on the top of Mount Taizi,
    Undertake large-scale water conservancy, work, work, work!
    Raise the long sword to slay the drought demon,
    Water the thousands of acres of dry land.
    
    Not afraid of three months of drought,
    Still harvest ten thousand stones of grain in the fall!
            Wang Yuliang
    
    The stone cliffs make way, the road is open,
    The canal water, like spraying pearls and splashing jade, has arrived;
    The Longquan Reservoir is built,
    No longer afraid of the disaster of drought.
            Liu Yiwen

    抗旱短曲
    老天不雨咱不怕，
    咱有锅驼机来当家；
    它一张口嘟嘟嘟，
    银龙直往麦地爬。
    春播闹得赛火燃，
    红旗飘飘热浪翻；
    人欢牛跃遍地响，
    “东方红”撒欢把风撵。
                沈彦
    太子山头树标杆，
    大修水利干干干！
    挥起长剑斩旱魔，
    千顷旱地水浇遍。
    天旱三月也不怕，
    秋后仍收粮万石！
            汪玉良
    石崖让路路开了，
    喷珠溅玉的渠水过了；
    龙泉水库修成了，
    不再怕干旱这个祸了。
            刘义文
