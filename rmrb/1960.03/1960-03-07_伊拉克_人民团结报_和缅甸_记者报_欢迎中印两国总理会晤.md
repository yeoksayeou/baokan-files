Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 6th: The Iraqi newspaper "People's Unity" published an editorial today welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India to meet with Nehru on resolving the Sino-Indian border issue.

The newspaper said that people all over the world are very pleased to see that China and India have taken important steps to resolve their disputes through negotiations.

The newspaper pointed out, "The world's imperialist and reactionary groups, especially the reactionary groups in India, have despicably used certain disputes to try to undermine the friendly relations between China and India. They believe that resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute—one of the problems left over from the era of imperialist rule—is impossible."

Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to hold a meeting with Prime Minister Nehru to resolve the border dispute between the two countries, the newspaper said that this has satisfied the people of Asia, especially the people of India. The newspaper also said that Zhou Enlai's proposal shows that China's policy is based on mutual harmony and friendship with peace-loving countries and people around the world. It is based on the lofty Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, and it is based on the Bandung Conference principles and the interests of the Asian-African struggle against imperialism.

The newspaper pointed out that the imperialists' attempts to poison and undermine the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Indian people have not and will never succeed. It said, "We are also deeply convinced that the path chosen by Asians towards liberation, independence, and national prosperity is becoming increasingly clear. The unity of the Asian people in the struggle against imperialism, which they recognize as the correct path to victory, is also increasingly confirmed."

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, March 5th: The Burmese newspaper "Reporter" welcomes the upcoming meeting between the Chinese and Indian Premiers to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue.

In an article published on March 1st, the newspaper said that although there have been disputes and open conflicts on the Sino-Indian border issue, neither side has abandoned the principle of peaceful negotiations between the leaders of the two countries.

The newspaper pointed out that when India was still a British colony and China was still under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, a servant of the United States, the boundary of the area currently in dispute between India and China had never been clearly defined. It is evident that the Sino-Indian border issue is somewhat complicated.

The newspaper believes that the meeting between the two prime ministers can pave the way for resolving the border issue between the two countries.

The newspaper expressed the hope that the leaders of China and India will meet soon to restore amicable relations between these two major Asian countries.

    伊拉克“人民团结报”和缅甸“记者报”
    欢迎中印两国总理会晤
    新华社巴格达6日电　伊拉克“人民团结报”今天发表社论，欢迎周恩来总理即将访问印度，就解决中印两国边界问题同尼赫鲁举行会晤。
    这家报纸说，全世界人民非常满意地看到，中印两国采取了重要步骤，来通过谈判解决两国间的纠纷。
    这家报纸指出，“全世界的帝国主义和反动集团，特别是印度的反动集团，卑鄙地利用了某些争端，设法破坏中印两国之间的友好关系，他们认为，解决中印两国之间的边界纠纷——这是帝国主义统治时代遗留下来的问题之一——是不可能的。”
    这家报纸在谈到周恩来总理曾经提出的希望同尼赫鲁总理就解决两国边界纠纷举行会晤的建议时说，这使亚洲人民、特别是印度人民感到满意。这家报纸又说，周恩来的建议表明，中国的政策是建立在同全世界爱好和平的国家和人民互相和睦和友好的基础之上的，它是建立在制度不同的国家之间实行和平共处这一崇高的列宁主义原则之上的，而且是建立在万隆会议原则和亚非反对帝国主义的斗争的利益之上的。
    这家报纸指出，帝国主义想毒化和破坏中印两国人民的牢不可破的友谊的企图没有而且也永远不会得逞。它说，“我们还深信，亚洲人选择的、走向解放、独立和民族繁荣的道路正在日益明确起来。亚洲人民认识到的团结一致同帝国主义斗争是导致胜利的正确道路，这一点也日益得到证实。”
    新华社仰光5日电　缅甸“记者报”表示欢迎中印两国总理即将举行会晤，讨论中印边界问题。
    这家报纸在3月1日发表的一篇文章中说，虽然在中印边界问题上有争论和曾经发生过公开的冲突，但是双方都没有放弃两国领导人和平谈判的原则。
    这家报纸指出，在印度还是英国的殖民地，中国还在美国的仆从蒋介石的统治下的时候，印度和中国目前争论的这个地区的边界一直没有可能明确地规定下来。由此可见中印边界问题是有点复杂的。
    这家报纸认为，通过两国总理的会晤，可以为解决两国边界问题铺平道路。
    这家报纸表示希望中印两国领导人早日会晤，使这两个亚洲大国的关系重趋融洽。
