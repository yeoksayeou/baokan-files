    An Example

    The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) work at the Yuncheng People's Hospital in Shanxi Province has achieved tremendous success. This is an example of Western medicine practitioners learning from TCM.
    The Yuncheng People's Hospital is an ordinary county hospital. Its achievements in TCM work once again prove the truth emphasized by the Party Central Committee: that TCM is a great treasure house. If the treasures of TCM are so rich in an ordinary county like Yuncheng, how rich are the treasures of TCM in the many counties like Yuncheng and the larger cities throughout the country? This awaits the exploration and organization by the national medical community!
    How to explore and organize the treasure house of TCM? The practice of the Yuncheng People's Hospital is a good reference. The Party organization of the hospital implemented the spirit of the Party's TCM policy. They mobilized Western medicine practitioners to learn from TCM, organized cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, integrated clinical practice, and used modern scientific methods to carry out scientific research. When organizing the treatment of difficult and complicated diseases with both TCM and Western medicine, they also organized them to cooperate closely, observing, analyzing, and testing the etiology, treatment methods, and medicinal properties, etc., in order to seek their scientific basis and laws, and to explore and clarify them in theory. They have written more than 200 scientific papers based on clinical practice, and also designed and manufactured an "ear acupoint tester" using electricity based on the theory of TCM meridians. All these efforts and achievements have also opened up broad avenues for the development of China's medical school. The example of Yuncheng People's Hospital tells us that as long as the medical community in various regions, under the leadership of the Party, dares to set high aspirations, dares to climb to the peak, and effectively implements the Party's TCM policy, China's medicine will develop rapidly.
    As the Party's TCM policy is gradually implemented throughout the country, there are medical units all over the country that have achieved outstanding results in TCM work, like the Yuncheng People's Hospital. They can all give us valuable enlightenment. As long as the medical community in our country can learn from each other well, they will be able to make more contributions to the development of the motherland's medical heritage.

    一个范例
    卫中
    山西运城人民医院的中医工作，取得了巨大成就。这是西医学习中医的一个范例。
    运城人民医院是一个普通的县医院。它在中医工作方面所取得的成就，又一次证明了党中央所强调指出的，中医药学是一个伟大的宝库的真理。像运城这样一个普通的县城里，中医药学的宝藏就如此丰富，全国有多少像运城这样的县城，有多少比运城大的城市，那里的中医药学的宝藏又是如何丰富，这都有待全国医务界去发掘整理！
    如何发掘和整理中医药学的宝库呢？运城人民医院的做法，也是一个很好的借鉴。该院的党组织，贯彻党的中医政策精神，他们发动西医学中医，组织中西医合作，结合临床，运用现代科学方法开展科学研究工作，在组织中西医治疗疑难病症时，也组织他们亲密地配合，对病因、治疗方法以及药性等进行观察、分析、化验，等等，借以从中寻求其科学的根据和规律，并在理论上加以探讨和阐明。他们结合临床已写出科学论文二百多篇，还根据中医经络学说的理论，利用电气，设计制成“耳穴测验器”。所有这些努力和已经取得的成果，也为发展我国医药学派打开了广阔的道路。运城人民医院的事例告诉我们，只要各地医务界在党的领导下，敢立大志，敢攀高峰，很好执行党的中医政策，就会使我国的医药学迅速地发展起来。
    随着党的中医政策在全国各地逐步深入贯彻，像运城人民医院在中医工作方面取得出色成就的医疗单位，在全国各地都有，它们都能给我们以各种宝贵的启示，我国医务界只要能很好地互相学习，在发扬祖国医学遗产上定能做出更多的贡献。
