    Release Glezos!
    Zhang Zhirang, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Association
    Manolis Glezos was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment by the Greek military court last July, based on fabricated facts and false testimonies, in violation of the country's criminal and criminal procedure laws, on trumped-up charges. He and other patriots who suffered the same illegal sentences filed a just appeal demanding the revocation of the verdict. For more than half a year, the Greek people and world public have continuously expressed strong protests. However, these patriots are still being held in prisons and subjected to torture.
    Glezos is a Greek national hero and a world peace fighter. The Greek authorities have slandered the struggle of him and other patriots for national independence and world peace as "espionage activities" and sentenced them to heavy sentences; when he fought to revoke the shameful verdict and supported the Greek people in defending democracy, he was given an additional seven months in prison for the crime of "insulting the authorities." All of this fully exposes the Greek government's willingness to follow the United States' Cold War policy, turning Greece into a war base for US imperialism, committing public outrage, carrying out conspiracies, persecuting patriots, and attempting to suppress the Greek people's resistance to the policy of betraying national interests. The Greek Supreme Court will re-examine the case on March 12. We solemnly demand that the Greek Supreme Court immediately revoke the military court's verdict and restore the freedom of Glezos and other patriots. Our just struggle will not cease until this demand is realized.

    释放格列索斯！
    中国政治法律学会副会长　张志让
    曼诺里斯·格列索斯在去年7月被希腊军事法庭根据明知是虚构的事实、虚伪的证言，违反本国的刑事和刑事诉讼法律，以莫须有的罪名，判处了剥夺自由九年的重刑。他和其他同受非法判决的爱国者提起正义上诉，要求撤销判决。半年多来，希腊人民和世界公众纷纷不断表示强烈抗议。但这些爱国者至今还被拘禁在监狱里，遭受折磨。
    格列索斯是希腊的民族英雄、世界的和平战士。希腊当局把他和其他爱国者为争取民族独立和世界和平的斗争，诬蔑为“间谍活动”而判以重刑；在他争取撤销可耻判决和支持希腊人民保卫民主的斗争时，又以“侮辱当局”的罪名，加判他七个月的徒刑。凡此一切都充分暴露了希腊政府为了追随美国的冷战政策，使希腊变为美帝国主义的战争基地，甘犯众怒，施展阴谋，迫害爱国者，企图借以镇压希腊人民对出卖民族利益政策的反抗。希腊最高法院于3月12日重新审理此案。我们严正要求希腊最高法院立即撤销军事法庭的判决，恢复格列索斯和其他爱国者的自由。我们的正义斗争，非至要求实现，决不停止。
