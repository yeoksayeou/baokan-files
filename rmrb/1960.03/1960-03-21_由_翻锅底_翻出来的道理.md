The phrase "turning over the pot bottom" is a slogan on the agricultural front in the Jin Southeast region of Shanxi Province. "Turning over the pot bottom" means turning over the bottom of the Shangdang Basin, leveling the bottom of the plains, removing the label of low-yield areas in the plains, realizing the grand ambition of the plains catching up with the mountains, even surpassing the mountains, and even having the mountains catch up with the plains again.

It's relatively easy to understand the mountains catching up with the plains. Plains are generally said to be rich and fertile, and it can be said that they have more capital in the agricultural production increase movement. But now the problem is that the mountainous areas have high yields, and the plains, which were originally located in the rich basin, have to turn around and catch up with the mountains. This is thought-provoking.

The "pot bottom" referred to by the masses in the Jin Southeast region of Shanxi Province mainly refers to the Luze Basin. As for the "pot edge," it seems to refer to places like Pingshun, Huguan, and Licheng. These places on the edge of the pot have always been considered poor places. So-called remote and poor areas, barren mountains and harsh rivers, thin soil, barren land, and lacking all five elements. However, a tiger fears added wings, and people fear having ambition. Poor but ambitious, their spirit is as magnificent as mountains and rivers. As long as they have this spirit, have the spirit to get rid of this "poverty and blankness," they can reverse the situation and create great miracles. Mountainous areas like Pingshun can cross the Yellow River first, which, in the eyes of those who believe only in conditions, is obviously difficult to understand. But things have indeed been done this way. Now the problem is not the mountains catching up with the plains, but the plains catching up with the mountains.

It can be seen that whether things are done well or badly, conditions are not the only factor. Conditions can be changed. Poverty, hardship, barrenness, and infertility are certainly not good things, but they can also stimulate people's strong will to change them and spur people forward. Wealth, fertility, and vastness are certainly good things. As long as we work hard, we will definitely leap forward faster and better than the mountainous areas. However, if conditions are superior, if we do not fully exert our subjective initiative, it will become a burden and we will leap forward slowly.

It seems that to turn over the pot bottom, we must first turn over our thinking. Poverty with ambition can turn into wealth; wealth with ambition will surely become richer. Therefore, the problem does not lie in whether the original "foundation" is poor or rich, nor in whether the original conditions are good or bad, but in always having the ambition to change the status quo, and to change it rapidly, with the revolutionary's heroic ambition and great spirit. The old society considered "not being arrogant when rich and not being discouraged when poor" to be commendable, but for revolutionaries, that is their true color, because they have a red heart. And this principle, by extension, applies to all issues. For example, people with poor work ability, as long as they are determined to improve, will quickly catch up with advanced individuals; people with considerable work experience, as long as they see that they still have shortcomings and are determined to reach higher levels, they will surely "go up another floor" every day. People who have read few books, if they realize that this is a defect and are determined to "read ten thousand volumes," will certainly be able to achieve their wishes; people who have read many books, if they can see that they have only read a part of the sea of books, and are not satisfied, they will move forward unswervingly, endlessly, learning as long as they live.

Turning over the pot bottom, in essence, means going from bad to good, from low to high, from poor to rich. Our socialist revolution and socialist construction aim to pursue goodness and wealth, and rapidly change the economic face of "poverty and blankness," which is to turn the pot bottom over. It can be seen that the three words "turning over the pot bottom" precisely express the ambition of our revolutionaries.

Turning over the pot bottom requires the revolutionary's ambition, courage, tenacity, perseverance, and spirit.

The spirit of turning over the pot bottom is needed everywhere. Because there are advanced, intermediate, and backward states everywhere, the backward catching up with the advanced, the advanced helping the backward, "learning, catching up, helping," and "catching up, surpassing, and achieving high standards" are all positive synonyms for the spirit of turning over the pot bottom.

Our country is rapidly changing the economic face of "poverty and blankness." Isn't this also turning over the pot bottom!

The pot bottom must be turned over, and it will definitely be turned over!

    由“翻锅底”翻出来的道理
    郑奋
    “翻锅底”，是山西晋东南区农业战线上的一个口号。“翻锅底”就是翻上党盆地之底，翻平川之底，摘掉平川低产区的帽子，实现川赶山，以至川超山，甚至再让山赶川的宏伟大志。
    山赶川，这是比较容易理解的。川地一般说是富饶而肥沃的，可以说在农业增产运动中他们有更多的本钱，但现在的问题是，山区产量多，而本来地处富饶盆地的川，要反转来赶山。这就耐人寻味了。
    山西晋东南地区群众所指的锅底，主要是指潞泽盆地，至于锅沿，看来就是指平顺、壶关、黎城这些地方了。这些锅沿上的地方，过去向来被认为是穷地方。所谓穷乡僻壤，穷山恶水，石厚土薄，地瘠民贫，金木水火土，五行俱缺。但是，虎怕插翅，人怕有志。穷而有志，气壮山河。只要有这口气，有甩掉这“一穷二白”之气，那就可以扭转乾坤，作出伟大的奇迹来。平顺这样的山地，可以先跨黄河，这在唯条件论者看来，显然是难以理解的。但事情毕竟是这样做出来了。现在的问题不是山赶川，而是川赶山。
    可见，事情办好办坏，条件并不是唯一的因素。条件是可以改变的。穷、苦、贫、瘠，固然不是好事，但也可以激起人们改变它的强烈意志，可以鞭策人们前进。富庶、肥沃、辽阔，当然是好事，只要努力，一定比山地跃进得更快，跃进得更好。但是，条件优越，如果不充分发挥主观能动性，就会形成包袱，就会跃得慢。
    看来，要翻锅底，必先翻思想。穷而有志，可以变富；富而有志，必能富上加富。所以，问题不在原来的“底子”穷或富，不在原来的条件好或坏，而在永远有改变现状，并且是迅速改变的志气，有革命者的豪情壮志和伟大气魄。旧社会认为难能可贵的“富不骄，穷不馁”，在革命者说来，那是他的本色，因为他们有一颗红心在。而这个道理，推而广之，在一切问题上，无不如此。比如说，工作能力较差的人，只要有志于提高，就会很快赶上先进者；有相当工作经验的人，只要看到自己还有不够的地方，有志于更高，也定能逐日“更上一层楼”。读书少的人，如认识到这是个缺陷，有志“破万卷”，结果也定能如愿以偿；读了很多书的人，如能看到自己实际只是读了书林卷海的一部分，不满足，就会一往直前，永无止境，活到老而学到老。
    翻锅底，其实质，就是说由不好到好，由低到高，由穷到富。我们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，目的就是要追求好，追求富，迅速改变“一穷二白”的经济面貌，就是要把锅底翻转过来。可见，这“翻锅底”三字也正是表示了我们革命者的雄心壮志。
    翻锅底，需要有革命者的志气、勇气，韧性、毅力、气魄。
    翻锅底的精神，是哪里都需要的。因为哪里也存在着先进、中间、落后的三种状态，落后赶先进，先进帮落后，“学、赶、帮”、“赶、超、高”，这一切，都是翻锅底精神的正面的同义词。
    我们国家在飞速地改变着“一穷二白”的经济面貌。这又何尝不是在翻锅底啊！
    锅底必须翻，也一定能翻！
