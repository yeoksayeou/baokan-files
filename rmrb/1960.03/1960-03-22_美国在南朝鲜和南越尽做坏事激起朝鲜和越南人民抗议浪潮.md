    U.S. Does Nothing But Bad Things in South Korea and South Vietnam, Inciting Waves of Protests from the Korean and Vietnamese People
    Protest Against U.S. Launching Missiles in South Korea
    15,000 People Rally in Pyongyang
    Han Sorya Exposes U.S. Lavish Talk of Peace While Preparing for War
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th - 15,000 people in Pyongyang held a rally this afternoon at the Moranbong Open-Air Theater to protest against U.S. imperialism launching missiles in South Korea.
    The rally began at 1 p.m., with angry people constantly raising their arms and shouting: "U.S. troops get out of South Korea immediately with your missiles!"
    Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet, Jeong Il-ryong, and leaders of the Fatherland Front and various democratic parties and social organizations attended the rally.
    Han Sorya, Chairman of the Korean National Peace Committee, spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the U.S. invading army's launch of the "Matador" missile at Osan, South Korea on February 26 was a provocative act that seriously violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and a challenge to the Korean people. U.S. imperialism is turning South Korea into a strategic base for atomic war, threatening peace in Korea and the Far East. The U.S. imperialist conspiracy has aroused the anger of the Korean people and the people of the world.
    Han Sorya emphasized that the U.S. imperialism's recent lavish talk of "peace" is a deceptive trick it is playing when it is at a disadvantage in the balance of military power. In reality, U.S. imperialism is continuing the "cold war" and preparing for war.
    Han Sorya emphasized that if U.S. imperialism dares to touch a single hair on the Korean people's heads, it will be destroyed in the flames of retaliation. U.S. imperialists know very well that our allies have powerful combat means and firepower that no army in the world possesses. The deadly enemy of the Korean people, U.S. imperialism, must stop its provocations, immediately withdraw the missiles and atomic weapons illegally brought into South Korea, and punish the masterminds and relevant personnel involved in this missile launch in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. He said that the Korean people will never allow U.S. imperialists to continue trampling on our land and slaughtering our people. U.S. troops get out of South Korea immediately!
    Representatives of workers, farmers, students, women, and cultural circles in Pyongyang all spoke at the meeting, condemning U.S. imperialism for talking about "peace" in words but actually preparing for a new war. They emphasized that U.S. troops must immediately get out of South Korea with their missiles.
    Hanoi Rally Commemorates Anti-U.S. Struggle Day
    Nguyen Xuan Thuy Condemns U.S. for Undermining Peace in Asia
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th - 1,200 representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi held a grand rally tonight to commemorate the tenth anniversary of "Solidarity Against U.S. Imperialism Day" and to support the upcoming Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and launch a donation campaign to support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence and the national independence movement of the Asian and African peoples.
    Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, warmly praised the heroic struggle of the people of Saigon-Cholon on March 19, 1950, against the intrusion of U.S. warships into South Vietnam in his speech at the meeting, and strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's barbarous interference in South Vietnam. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism has not only turned South Vietnam into its colony, but is also turning Laos into its military base and colony.
    Nguyen Xuan Thuy accused the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" at the meeting as being in fact a military aggression treaty. He also said that the U.S.-Southeast Asia military bloc, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S.-Laos, and the U.S.-Japan collusion are all instigated by the U.S. and are closely related to each other, just like the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek and U.S.-Syngman Rhee collusion. Their common goal is to undermine the independence, unification, and peace of Asian countries.
    Nguyen Xuan Thuy pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy will never succeed. He said that the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the Vietnamese people have been tested in the anti-U.S. struggle and have all achieved victory. In this era, no imperialism can act arbitrarily anymore.
    When Nguyen Xuan Thuy spoke to this point, the emotional masses at the meeting raised their arms and shouted: "U.S. get out of South Vietnam!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" Nguyen Xuan Thuy then talked about the heroic struggle of the Algerian people and the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting. He condemned the U.S. imperialism's insincere attitude at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, condemned the U.S. for obstructing the agreement at the conference on the cessation of nuclear testing and preparing to conduct underground nuclear weapons tests. He said that all these bad things are created by the U.S. The U.S. is the enemy of all mankind and peace.
    After speeches by representatives from Saigon-Cholon and Hanoi women, the conference unanimously adopted a recommendation to the Vietnam International Commission, severely condemning U.S. imperialism's interference in South Vietnam and the activities of the U.S. military delegation in South Vietnam, and demanding that the International Commission take measures to force the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group to withdraw the U.S. military aid advisory group and the "Temporary Equipment Refreshment Group" from South Vietnam, stop building and expanding military bases and strategic highways in South Vietnam, stop transporting weapons into South Vietnam, and withdraw the illegally imported weapons and war materials from South Vietnam.

    韩雪野强调指出，美帝国主义最近侈谈“和平”，这是它在军事力量对比中处于不利地位时进行的欺骗勾当，实际上美帝国主义在继续“冷战”，进行战争准备。
    韩雪野强调，美帝国主义如果胆敢触动朝鲜人民一根头发，它将在反击的火焰中遭到灭亡。美帝国主义者很清楚，我们盟国掌握着全世界任何国家的军队都没有的强大的战斗的手段和火力。朝鲜人民的死敌美帝国主义必须停止挑衅，立即撤走非法运入南朝鲜的导弹和原子武器，根据停战协定惩罚这次发射导弹的主谋者和有关人员。他说，朝鲜人民绝不允许美帝国主义者继续践踏我们的国土和残杀我们的人民，美军立即从南朝鲜滚出去！

    阮春水在会上指责日美“安全条约”事实上是一个军事侵略条约。他还说，美国—东南亚军事集团、美国—吴庭艳、美国—老挝、美国—日本的勾结同美国—蒋介石、美国—李承晚的勾结一样都是美国主使的而且彼此之间是有着密切联系的。他们的共同目的就是破坏亚洲各国的独立、统一和和平。
