    German Engineers Invent Fabric That Needs No Weaving

    The German Democratic Republic will mass-produce this year a textile product called "Floretta" that requires no weaving process. This material can be used as clothing material and industrial material. The first successful trial production was a skirt material as light as gossamer.

    The production process of this textile is somewhat similar to that of paper. In production, the raw materials are directly "rolled" into finished products. This eliminates the spinning and weaving processes that have been necessary for textiles since ancient times. The first batch of experimental machines came from various paper mills, and the Floretta machine looks like a modified paper making machine.

    This method can use various fibers as raw materials, and all fiber scraps can be processed. After using this method, general textile factories can increase their production capacity eighteen times with only a 6% increase in labor.

    This material is washable, dry cleanable, wrinkle-resistant, unbreakable, can be dyed and printed in various colors, and can be glued or sewn. This material will be used in the future to manufacture cheap towels, insulation materials, curtains, and summer clothes.

    "Skrang" woolen overcoats have also recently appeared on the market in the German Democratic Republic. "Skrang" is also basically "rolled," using only 4% yarn, meaning almost no spinning is required, and absolutely no weaving.

    德工程师发明无需纺织的衣料
    德意志民主共和国今年将大量生产一种无需经过纺织工序的纺织品“弗洛列塔”。这种料子可以用做衣料和工业用料，第一次试制成功的就是一种轻如羽纱的裙料。
    这种纺织品的生产工艺过程同纸有些类似。在生产时，把原料直接“轧制”成成品。这样就取消了纺织品自古以来必需经过的纺和织的过程。第一批试验性机器就是来自各造纸厂的，而弗洛列塔机器看起来就像一台有所改变的造纸机。
    这种方法可以使用各种纤维为原料，而且所有纤维下脚料都可以加工。一般纺织厂使用这种方法后，只要增加6％的劳动力，生产能力就可增加十八倍。
    这种料子可以水洗、干洗、耐褶、不会折断，可以染上和印上各种颜色，可以粘合或缝合。这种材料今后将用来制造便宜的毛巾、绝缘材料、挂帘和夏季衣服。
    德意志民主共和国市场上最近还出现了“斯克浪”羊毛呢料大衣。“斯克浪”基本上也是“轧制”的，只用4％的纱，也就是说几乎不用纺，而且是完全不用织的。
