Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 1st - Hunan will extensively promote the use of rice transplanters this year to change the backward situation of "facing the mud and having their backs to the sky" when transplanting rice seedlings for thousands of years. As of February 20th, statistics show that 160,000 rice transplanters have been manufactured throughout the province, and more than 185,000 rice transplanter operators and "seedling hands" have been trained. When the early rice transplanting season arrives, the transplanter operators will operate the transplanters and show their skills in the fields.

In the past two years, the masses in various parts of Hunan have promoted the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and have successively created more than 30 types of rice transplanters. The Provincial Party Committee has given strong support to these creations of the masses and has organized multiple tests, evaluations, and improvements. After evaluation, the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter, the Changde direct-insertion rice transplanter, and the semi-automatic rice transplanter created by the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute were promoted with emphasis last year. These three types of rice transplanters have the advantages of good quality, high efficiency, simple structure, easy operation, and can reduce labor intensity. Trials on 1,207 mu of land have proved that the efficiency is increased by one to three times compared with manual transplanting, and the average yield per mu is slightly higher than manual transplanting. The reasons for the increased production are that they seized the season and ensured reasonable close planting. This year, in the large-scale manufacturing and promotion, Party committees at all levels throughout the province have strengthened their leadership. Special management agencies have been established from the special districts to the people's communes, led by the first secretary of the Party committee, to grasp manufacturing, quality, promotion, and technical training. In view of the fact that this is a new task, the Party committees in various places have strengthened publicity among cadres and the masses in a timely manner, organized the broad masses of commune members to hold forums and discussions, and held more than 560 on-site meetings and skill competitions, using pine needles as rice seedlings for demonstrations and organizing the masses to visit, thus greatly promoting the manufacturing and promotion of rice transplanters. Tang Jianzhong, a sixty-year-old man from the Shaoshan Commune in Xiangtan County who usually does not go out, came to the site to visit and took off his shoes and socks to try transplanting. He praised the rice transplanter with the following poem: "Pangu created the world for thousands of years, generations have transplanted fields by hand, manual transplanting is unspeakably hard, facing the mud and having their backs to the sky, it is difficult to transplant one mu a day; today the people are better than Luban, farmers have created rice transplanters, machines replace manual transplanting, the waist is not bent and the back is not hunched, and four mu can be transplanted a day."

Ensuring that the manufactured rice transplanters fully meet the specifications and quality requirements is an important key to successful promotion. Therefore, all localities have focused on manufacturing technical training and arranged for special factories to produce them. As early as last year, relevant departments in Hunan Province held a provincial manufacturing technical training class in Changde, followed by 63 counties and cities holding manufacturing training classes, training a total of more than 70,000 manufacturing experts. According to the different types of rice transplanters and manufacturing technical requirements, a total of more than 1,100 factories have been arranged to specialize in manufacturing. The local and county party committees have continuously convened on-site meetings for quality inspection and grand evaluation of rice transplanter manufacturing. All manufacturing plants have strictly implemented the product inspection system, adopting a three-stage acceptance system for raw materials, parts and components, and finished products, thereby ensuring that each machine manufactured is a qualified machine. At the same time, all communes have formed the trained rice transplanter operators into professional teams, so that the rice transplanter usage technology can take root among the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 1st - Jiangxi county and commune industrial workers are rushing to manufacture Jiangxi "59" rice transplanters, fully supporting spring plowing production. Tens of thousands of rice transplanters that have been manufactured are being continuously transported to the countryside.

In the rush to manufacture rice transplanters, workers in various agricultural machinery factories, farm implement factories, and woodworking factories have vigorously reformed tools, created indigenous equipment, and transformed manual operations into semi-mechanized operations, so that efficiency has increased several times. When the workers Chen Yunjiang and Guo Chunyi of the Ganzhou Woodworking Factory were rushing to manufacture wooden parts for rice transplanters, they saw that each rice transplanter seedling box had 124 holes, and drilling them one by one manually was very slow, so they created an improved drill bit and used a motor to drive it, increasing efficiency by about five times. The agricultural machinery factory workers improved more than 20 kinds of manufacturing tools, and the work efficiency was increased by one to fifty times respectively. Now the city has completed the manufacturing task of 500 rice transplanters ahead of schedule. The workers of the Le'an County Machinery Factory used indigenous iron, scrap iron, and hand files to imitate and successfully create more than 60 sets of machine equipment such as indigenous gantry planers, indigenous shaper planers, and bench vises, greatly accelerating the manufacturing progress of rice transplanters.

Manufacturing rice transplanters is a completely new task for county and commune local industries. The workers of various machinery factories and farm implement factories have adopted the method of learning, manufacturing, testing, improving, and training technical personnel at the same time, strengthening the technical force and improving the quality of rice transplanters. The farm implement factories of various communes in Yongfeng County selected a group of commune members who knew a little about farm implement technology and went to the farm implement factory to learn and work at the same time, so that the number of technicians in the commune-run factories in the county quickly increased from 2,000 to more than 4,000, and the manufacturing of rice transplanters was successfully carried out. The farm implement factories of various communes in Chongren County transferred more than 100 technical workers with higher technical levels, brought their own tools, and concentrated them in the county machinery factory to jointly establish a factory specializing in the manufacture of "59" rice transplanters, teaching and learning from each other, learning from each other's strengths, and improving the manufacturing technical level generally. In more than a month, more than 1,300 rice transplanters were manufactured. The farm implement factories of various communes in Jinxian County specially established an agricultural machinery scientific research station. After thousands of skilled craftsmen created and mobilized the broad masses to test, propose opinions, and improve, the manufacturing progress was not only accelerated, but also the quality greatly exceeded that of the Jiangxi "59" rice transplanter, and the seedling output rate reached more than 95%.

    训练大批插秧机手　安排专厂加紧制造
    湖南江西推广插秧机
    据新华社长沙1日电　湖南今年将大量推广使用水稻插秧机，改变千百年来插秧时“脸朝泥巴背朝天”的落后状况。截至2月20日统计，全省各地已经制造出插秧机十六万部，训练好插秧机手和“种子手”十八万五千多名。等到早稻插秧季节一到，插秧机手们就将操纵着插秧机，在田中大显威风。
    近两年来，湖南各地群众发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，曾先后创制了各种类型的插秧机三十多种。省委对于群众的这些创造，给予了大力支持，多次组织试验、评比鉴定、改进。通过鉴定，去年有重点地推广了醴陵二号插秧机、常德直插式插秧机和湖南省农业机械研究所创制的半自动操作插秧机。这三种插秧机都具有质量好、工效高、结构简单、操作容易、能减轻劳动强度等优点。经一千二百零七亩田的试插证明，工效比手插提高一倍至三倍，平均每亩产量比手插略有增加。增产的原因，一是抢住了季节，二是保证了合理密植。今年在大量制造和推广中，全省各级党委都加强了领导。从专区到人民公社都成立专管机构，由党委第一书记挂帅，抓制造、抓质量、抓推广、抓技术训练。鉴于这是一项新的工作，各地党委都及时地在干部和群众中加强宣传工作，组织广大社员座谈讨论，并且举行了五百六十多次现场会、比武会，用松针当稻秧进行表演，组织群众参观，因而大大推动了插秧机的制造和推广工作。湘潭县韶山公社平时不出门的六十多岁老人汤建中，这次来到现场参观时，也脱下鞋袜跳下水试插。他用以下的诗句歌颂了插秧机：“盘古开天几千年，祖祖辈辈手插田，手工插田苦难言，面朝泥巴背朝天，一天难插一亩田；今朝人民胜鲁班，农民造出插秧机，机械代替手插田，腰不弯来背不驼，一天能插四亩零。”
    保证造出的插秧机完全符合规格质量要求，是顺利推广的重要关键。因此，各地都抓紧制造技术训练工作和安排专厂生产。早在去年，湖南省有关部门就在常德举办全省制造技术训练班，接着又有六十三个县、市举办了制造训练班，共训练了制造能手七万多名。各地根据插秧机的不同类型和制造技术要求，共安排了一千一百多个工厂专门制造。各地委、县委不断召开插秧机制造质量大检查、大评比的现场会。各制造厂严格执行了产品检验制度，采取原料、零件部件、成品三段验收制，从而保证了制造一部、合格一部。同时，各公社都把经过训练的插秧机手组成专业队，使插秧机使用技术在群众中落脚生根。
    据新华社南昌1日电　江西县社工业职工突击赶制江西“59”型插秧机，全力支援春耕生产。已经造好的几万部插秧机，正源源运往农村。
    各地农业机械厂、农具厂、木器厂等职工，在赶制插秧机中大搞工具改革，造土设备，变手工操作为半机械化操作，使功效成倍提高。赣州市木器厂在赶制插秧机木件时，工人陈运江、郭春益看到每部插秧机秧箱有一百二十四个眼，用人工一个一个地钻十分缓慢，就创造了改良钻头，并用马达带动，功效提高五倍左右。农业机械厂职工改进制造工具二十多种，工效分别提高一倍到五十倍。现在全市已经提前完成了五百部插秧机的制造任务。乐安县机械厂职工利用土铁、废铁和手工锉，仿制、创制成功了土龙门刨床、土牛头刨床、台钳等机器设备六十多部，大大加速了插秧机的制造进度。
    制造插秧机，对县社地方工业来说是一项全新的工作。各地机械厂、农具厂职工采取了边学、边造、边试验、边改进、边培训技术人才的办法，壮大了技术力量，提高了插秧机的质量。永丰县各公社农具厂挑选了一批稍为懂得一点农具技术的社员，到农具厂边学边做，使全县社办工厂技工由二千人迅速增加到四千多人，顺利开展了插秧机的制造工作。崇仁县各公社农具厂抽调技术水平较高的技术工人一百多名，自带工具集中到县机械厂，联合建立起一个专门制造“59”型插秧机的工厂，互教互学，取长补短，使制造技术水平普遍得到提高，一个多月时间就制造了一千三百多部插秧机。进贤县各公社农具厂专门成立农业机械科学研究站，经过千名能工巧匠创制和发动广大群众试验提出意见改进，结果不仅加快了制造进度，而且质量大大超过了江西“59”型插秧机，出秧率达95％以上。
