To prevent spring-sown crops from freezing, meteorological observatories across the country are intensifying agricultural meteorological forecasting.

This newspaper reports: This year, the work of meteorological services for spring sowing has been universally strengthened. After the Ministry of Agriculture and the Central Meteorological Bureau jointly issued the "Joint Notice on Doing a Good Job in Timely Spring Sowing and Overcoming Late Frost Damage" in late January, meteorological units at the provincial and special district levels mostly made arrangements one after another, requiring meteorological service stations at all levels to frequently understand the Party committee's intentions for agricultural production and spring sowing arrangements in spring sowing meteorological service work. At the same time, they should focus on agricultural meteorological forecasts for the sowing period and short- and medium-term forecasts of disastrous weather. In terms of weather forecasting, each meteorological (climate) service station should conscientiously make supplementary weather forecasts for the local area based on large-scale weather forecasts. A round of training should be conducted for personnel of the people's commune meteorological outposts and groups, imparting knowledge about meteorological services for spring sowing. In order to do a good job in spring sowing meteorological services, the Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Bureau is preparing to find suitable sowing periods and temperature indicators for the sowing period of local major crops, as well as temperature indicators for rice seedling rot in agricultural meteorological forecasting. In terms of weather forecasting, the bureau will mainly identify forecasting indicators for cold waves, low temperatures (including late frosts), and other disastrous weather forecasting indicators that affect spring sowing. The Dafang Meteorological Station in this province has sent people to go deep into various communes and management areas to conduct agricultural meteorological surveys in order to find practical agricultural meteorological forecasting indicators.

In order to better serve spring sowing with meteorology, various localities have begun training commune meteorological outpost and group personnel and carrying out publicity activities on meteorological knowledge. Yiyang, Yushan, Leping, and Yujiang counties in Shangrao Special District, Jiangxi Province, have completed the task of training outpost and group meteorological personnel. Shaoyang Special District in Hunan Province trained 5,000 brigade meteorological personnel in February. Xiangtan Special District recently conducted a major inspection and rectification of commune meteorological service outposts and trained 5,000 commune meteorologists. The Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Bureau requires meteorological observatories and stations at all levels to vigorously carry out a publicity campaign on meteorological knowledge, focusing on spring sowing services, especially publicizing the significance of early sowing, the scientific truth that man can conquer nature, so that commune cadres and members understand the significance of spring sowing frost prevention and how to use weather forecasts and agricultural meteorological forecasts.

Currently, meteorological services for spring sowing have achieved some results. According to the Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Bureau, early rice in the central and southern regions is often hit by rainstorms from heading to flowering to maturity. Early rice in the northern part of the province is harvested late, and late rice is sown late, and the flowering period is often harmed by cold dew winds. Together with relevant departments, the bureau has conducted research in various aspects such as plant physiology, cultivation, seeds, plant protection, and agricultural meteorology, and proposed suitable early rice sowing period forecasts, which the agricultural departments are satisfied with. Staff members of the Yishan County Hydrological and Meteorological Center Station in Guangxi Province visited more than a dozen veteran farmers and, with the assistance of experienced agricultural technicians, made a meteorological forecast for the sowing period of local early-sown crops in mid-January. The county party committee attached great importance to this forecast, held a meeting to discuss it, and immediately notified various localities to postpone the sowing plan of some crops in a timely manner, avoiding the impact of the freezing and cold waves that appeared in late January, and preventing production losses.

### 不让春播作物受冻受寒  各地气象台站大抓农业气象预报

    不让春播作物受冻受寒
    各地气象台站大抓农业气象预报
    本报讯　气象工作为春播服务的工作，今年普遍获得加强。1月下旬，农业部和中央气象局发出“关于做好适时春播和战胜晚霜冻工作的联合通知”后，各省、专区一级气象单位，大都相继做了布置，要求各级气象服务台、站，在春播气象服务工作中，经常了解党委对农业生产的意图和春播安排情况，同时要抓好播种期农业气象预报和中短期灾害性天气预报。在天气预报方面，各气象（候）服务站要根据大范围的天气预报，认真地做好本地的补充天气预报。对人民公社气象服务哨、组工作人员进行一次轮训，传授关于气象为春播服务的知识。贵州省气象局为了做好春播气象服务工作，在农业气象预报方面，准备找当地主要作物的适宜播种期和播种期的温度指标，以及水稻烂秧的温度指标。在天气预报方面，主要找寒潮、低温（包括晚霜冻）的预报指标，以及影响春播的其他灾害性天气预报指标。这个省的大方气象站，已派人分头深入各公社、管理区进行农业气象调查，以便找出切合实际的农业气象预报指标。
    为了使气象更好地为春播服务，各地开始训练公社气象哨、组工作人员，并开展气象知识的宣传活动。江西省上饶专区弋阳、玉山、乐平、余江四县已完成训练哨、组气象人员的任务；湖南省邵阳专区在2月训练大队气象员五千名；湘潭专区最近对公社气象服务哨进行了一次大检查大整顿，并训练公社气象员五千名。广东省气象局要求各级气象台、站，围绕春播服务，大力开展一次气象知识的宣传活动，特别要宣传早播的意义、人定胜天的科学道理，使公社干部和社员了解春播防寒的意义和怎样利用天气预报和农业气象预报。
    目前，气象为春播服务工作已经取得了一些成绩。广东省气象局根据中部、南部地区早稻，从抽穗，扬花到成熟期间，常受暴风雨侵袭，北部早稻收获迟，晚稻播得晚，开花期常受寒露风为害等情况，和有关部门一起，从植物生理、栽培、种子、植保、农业气象等各方面进行研究，提出了适宜的早稻播种期预报，使农业部门感到满意。广西省宜山县水文气象中心站的工作人员，访问了十多位老农，并经有经验的农业技术人员的协助，在1月中旬就做出了当地早播作物播种期气象预报，县委对这个预报很重视，召开会议进行讨论，并立即通知各地，把一部分作物的播种计划及时延缓，躲过了1月下旬出现的冰冻、寒潮的影响，使生产避免了损失。
