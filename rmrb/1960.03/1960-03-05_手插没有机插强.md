    Rape flowers bloom, covering the field in yellow,
    Hand planting is not as good as machine planting,
    One hand can only plant one seedling at a time,
    Machine planting covers twelve rows at once,
    Machine planting does three and a half mu a day,
    Hand planting can't keep up in ten days.

    手插没有机插强
    油菜开花满坝黄，
    手插没有机插强，
    一手只能栽一蔸，
    机插一次十二行，
    机插一天三亩半，
    手插十天跟不上。
