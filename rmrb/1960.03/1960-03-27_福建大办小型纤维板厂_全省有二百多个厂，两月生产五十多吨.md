    Fujian Vigorously Develops Small-Scale Fiberboard Factories
    More Than 200 Factories Throughout the Province Produce More Than 50 Tons in Two Months
    (Our dispatch) Fujian province is blooming with small-scale factories that comprehensively utilize timber, primarily producing fiberboard, through self-reliance and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. This year, the province has successively built 208 small-scale fiberboard factories, producing more than 52 tons of fiberboard for the country in just over two months. Currently, fiberboard factories throughout the province are mobilizing workers to vigorously carry out technical innovation and achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations.
    Fujian is one of the major timber supply bases in southern China. Discarded scrap wood, treetop wood, shavings, etc., could produce 600,000 tons of fiberboard annually, worth 270 million yuan at 450 yuan per ton. Therefore, this is a fast, good, and economical way to solve China's timber shortage and fully utilize forest resources, especially opening up broad avenues for the majority of people in mountainous areas to fully utilize forest resources and increase the collective economy and industrialization speed of the communes.
    After the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the instruction to "Vigorously Engage in Comprehensive Utilization of Timber" last December, it immediately received an enthusiastic and widespread response from the masses. Party committees at all levels and in all counties strengthened their leadership over this movement, with the secretaries in charge of forestry or industry taking the lead and establishing special offices to lead and manage this work. Comrade Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally went deep into forest areas and factories to inspect the construction and production of fiberboard factories. Due to the personal leadership of Party committees at all levels and the adoption of the method of simultaneous development by state-owned enterprises and communes, the tremendous superiority of the people's communes was fully utilized, greatly accelerating the speed of factory construction and making the movement more widespread.
      In the process of establishing factories, they resolutely implemented the principle of "small-scale as the main focus, launching with indigenous methods, starting with indigenous methods before adopting foreign ones, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting small and growing big, and gradually improving." Localities, adhering to the spirit of using local materials, self-reliance, making do with whatever is available, and running factories diligently and thriftily, fully relied on the masses and promoted a communist style of daring to think and daring to act, thereby overcoming difficulties such as insufficient technology, equipment, and raw materials in factory construction. For example, the Nanping State-owned Xiqin Forest Products Chemical Factory used a manual straw cutter instead of a crushing machine in the trial production of fiberboard, modified a wine press into a pre-press, and used stone mills and water-powered pestles instead of pulping machines, etc.
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, 30 state-owned and commune-run fiberboard factories throughout the province have used indigenous methods and local materials to create and improve new tools such as raw material crushers and pulping machines, and have fully utilized hydraulic power instead of the original heavy manual operations. Processes that originally required male full-time laborers to operate manually can now be entirely replaced by female laborers. These 30 factories alone can save 1,290 full-time laborers per day.
    At the same time, local Party committees also organized various departments in the region to carry out communist collaboration in the construction and production of fiberboard factories. All machinery factories, farm implement factories, and repair shops in Nanping City vigorously supported the masses in running fiberboard factories and rushed to manufacture more than 30 fiberboard hot presses and more than 100 other types of small equipment. The Jian'ou County Party Committee designated the county's General Machinery Factory, Mechanical and Electrical Repair Factory, and Machine Tool Factory to specifically help various fiberboard factories and workshops carry out technical innovation, producing a large number of indigenous iron light rails and hot pressing plates, and also trial-produced foreign-method fiberboard production equipment such as multi-knife and multi-saw slicing machines, raw material crushing machines, and Dutch-style pulping machines, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    福建大办小型纤维板厂
    全省有二百多个厂，两月生产五十多吨
    本报讯　用自力更生、土洋结合的办法大办以生产纤维板为主的木材综合利用小型工厂，已在福建全省遍地开花。这个省今年已经先后建成小型纤维板厂二百零八个，在两个多月中，为国家生产纤维板五十二吨多。目前，全省纤维板厂正在发动广大职工大闹技术革新，实现手工操作机械化、半机械化。
    福建是我国南方木材主要供应基地之一，每年抛弃的碎木、梢木、刨花等，就可以生产六十万吨纤维板，每吨以四百五十元计，即值二亿七千万元。因此这是解决我国木材缺乏和充分利用森林资源多快好省的办法，特别是为广大山区人民充分利用森林资源、增加公社集体经济和工业化速度开辟了宽广的道路。
    去年12月，中共福建省委发出了“大搞木材综合利用”的指示以后，立即获得了广大群众热烈而广泛的响应，各地、县委都加强了对这一运动的领导，并由分管林业或工业的书记挂帅，成立了专门的办公室领导管理这一工作。省委第一书记叶飞同志亲自深入林区、工厂检查纤维板建厂和生产情况。由于各级党委亲自挂帅，采取国营与公社同时发展的办法，充分地发挥了人民公社的巨大优越性，大大地加快了建厂的速度，使运动更加广泛地开展起来。
      在办厂过程中，他们坚决贯彻了“小型为主，土法上马，先土后洋，土洋并举，从小到大，逐步提高”的方针。各地本着就地取材、自力更生、因陋就简和勤俭办场的精神，充分依靠群众，发扬了敢想敢做的共产主义风格，从而克服了在建厂中的技术设备、原料不足等困难。如南平国营西芹林产化工厂在试制纤维板中，没有轧碎机就用土铡刀代替，用制酒压榨器改装成预压器，用石磨、水碓代替打浆机等等。
    在以手工操作机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，全省已经有三十个国营和社办的纤维板厂，用土办法就地取材，创造和改进了原料压碎机和打浆机等新工具，并全部利用水力作动力，代替原来笨重的手工操作，原来要由男全劳力手工操作的工序，现在全部可由女劳力来代替，仅这三十个厂，每天就可以节约全劳力一千二百九十人。
    同时各地党委还组织了本地区各部门对纤维板厂的建设和生产开展共产主义大协作。南平市所有的机械厂、农具厂、修配厂都大力支援群众大办纤维板厂，并赶制了纤维板热压机三十多部，以及其他各种小型设备一百多种。建瓯县委指定这个县的通用机器厂、机电修配厂和机具厂专门帮助各纤维板厂、车间开展技术革新，生产了大批土铁轻轨、热压板，还试制成多刀多锯切片机、原料切碎机和荷兰式打浆机等洋法生产纤维板的设备，从而大大地加速了机械化和半机械化的进度。
