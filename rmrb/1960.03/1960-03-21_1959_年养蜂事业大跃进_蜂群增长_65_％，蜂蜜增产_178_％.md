    Great Leap Forward in Beekeeping in 1959
    Bee Colonies Increase by 65%, Honey Production Up 178%
    (Our Dispatch) China's beekeeping industry achieved rapid development in 1959. According to statistics from twenty-seven provinces (cities), the number of bee colonies nationwide reached 4.95 million, an increase of 65% over 1958. Among these, 3.36 million colonies were of native breeds, and 1.59 million colonies were of foreign breeds. The former averaged an annual honey production of 29.6 jin per colony, while the latter averaged 55 jin per colony. In 1959, the national total honey production increased by 178% compared to 1958. Beeswax production also saw a significant increase. Heilongjiang Province experienced the most significant growth in beekeeping. According to statistics from October 1959, the number of bee colonies increased from 85,000 at the beginning of the year to over 170,000, doubling the number from 1958; commercial honey production reached 42,000 dan, an increase of 1.6 times over 1958; beeswax production reached 400 dan, doubling the amount from 1958. In Zhejiang Province, the number of bee colonies in 1959 increased from 80,000 in 1958 to 182,600, an increase of over 125%.
    The area of beekeeping distribution nationwide also expanded significantly. In Jilin Province, 30% of the counties had basically no beekeeping in 1958. In 1959, every commune in each county, regardless of mountainous or semi-mountainous areas, engaged in beekeeping, and beekeeping also began in pastoral areas. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, beekeeping was only present in twelve counties in 1958, but expanded to forty-five counties in 1959.
    Significant progress was also made in improving beekeeping techniques and management, as well as improving native bee breeds and capturing wild bees. According to the unit yield statistics of more than 113,000 colonies of Italian bees in eight provinces and autonomous regions, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia, twelve colonies achieved over 1000 jin of honey, 101 colonies achieved over 400 jin, 952 colonies achieved over 300 jin, and more than 3700 colonies achieved over 100 jin.

    蜂群增长65％，蜂蜜增产178％
    本报讯　1959年我国养蜂事业获得了迅速发展。据二十七个省（市）的统计，全国蜂群数达到四百九十五万群，比1958年增长65％，其中本国蜂三百三十六万群，外来蜂种一百五十九万群。前者平均每群年产蜜量二十九点六斤，后者平均年产蜜量五十五斤。1959年全国总产蜜量比1958年增长178％。蜂蜡产量也有很大的增加。养蜂增长最显著的黑龙江省，据1959年10月份统计，蜜蜂由年初八万五千群繁殖到十七万群以上，比1958年增长一倍；商品蜜四万二千担，比1958年增长一点六倍；产蜡四百担，比1958年增长一倍。浙江省1959年的蜂群在1958年八万群的基础上，繁殖到十八万二千六百群，比1958年增长125％以上。
    全国养蜂分布的面积也有了显著的扩大，吉林省1958年有30％的县基本上没有养蜂，1959年各县无论山区、半山区的每个公社都养了蜜蜂，牧区也开始养蜂。新疆维吾尔自治区1958年养蜂只有十二个县，1959年扩大到四十五个县。
    养蜂技术与饲养管理的改进提高，以及中蜂改良和收捕野蜂的工作也有了很大的发展。据浙江、福建、湖南、山西、陕西、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古等八个省、自治区的十一万三千多群意大利蜂的单位产量统计，达到千斤蜜以上的有十二群，四百斤以上的有一百零一群，三百斤以上的有九百五十二群，一百斤以上的有三千七百多群。
