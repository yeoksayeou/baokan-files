    American Factories Operating Below Capacity
    The AFL-CIO's research department issued a monthly economic review on the 3rd, predicting that the government's current policies would inevitably slow down economic development this year and cause an industrial recession in 1961. They pointed out that signs of this recession are already visible in the American economy. The gap between sales and production capacity is widening, with American industry as a whole utilizing only 84% of its production capacity by the end of last year. At the same time, consumer credit debt increased by $5.4 billion last year, which reduced residents' purchasing power in 1960.

    美国工厂开工不足
    美国工会劳联—产联的研究部机构3日发表的每月经济评论预料，政府目前的政策不可避免地要降低今年经济发展的速度并使1961年工业生产衰退。他们指出，甚至现在在美国经济中都可以看到这种衰退的迹象。销售和生产能力的脱节越来越大，美国整个工业至去年年底仅仅利用它的生产能力的84％。同时，消费者赊购的债务在去年增加了五十四亿美元，这就使得居民1960年的购货支付能力下降。
