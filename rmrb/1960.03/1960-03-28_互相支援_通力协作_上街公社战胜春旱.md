    Mutual Support, Coordinated Efforts
    Shangjie Commune Overcomes Spring Drought
    The Shangjie People's Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, launched a collaborative effort and overcame the spring drought.

    The drought resistance work in this commune was developing unevenly. The commune's Party committee called on all production teams to share resources and support the weaker teams. Responding to the Party committee's call, the Xiyuan Brigade dispatched 150 laborers to form a specialized charcoal burning team, urgently producing charcoal, ensuring sufficient fuel for all twelve of the commune's water pumps. The Ronggao Brigade freed up seventy-eight waterwheels to support the Qia’an and Jianping Brigades, which had poorer water conservancy infrastructure and larger drought-affected areas. The Houguan Brigade installed a 45-horsepower water pump last winter, capable of irrigating 2,000 mu of fields, but it required a canal to be effective. The Shangjie and Xinfeng Brigades dispatched labor to support the construction, completing the canal and enabling the Houguan Brigade's wheat fields to be universally irrigated. The Houguan Brigade sent commune members to assist the Houmei Brigade in repairing two field canals, allowing the Houmei Brigade's wheat fields to also be irrigated.

    互相支援　通力协作
    上街公社战胜春旱
    福建省闽侯县上街人民公社开展协作，战胜了春旱。
    这个公社抗旱工作发展不平衡，公社党委号召各个生产队互通有无，支援薄弱队。各个生产队响应党委的号召，溪源大队抽调了一百五十个劳力组成烧木炭专业队，赶烧木炭，使全社十二架抽水机，有了充足的燃料。榕槁大队腾出七十八架水车，支援了水利建设差、受旱面积多的歧安、建平两个大队。侯官大队去冬安下四十五马力的抽水机一台，能灌田二千亩，但需要开一条渠道，才能发挥作用。上街、新峰两大队就抽出劳力支援，把渠道建成了，使侯官大队麦田普遍灌了水。侯官大队派出社员协助厚美大队抢修了二条田间渠道，使厚美大队的麦田也灌上了水。
