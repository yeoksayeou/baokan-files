Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 11th. Spurred by the slogan "For Peace and Socialism, One Drives Another, Advancing with a Common Pace," the three largest cities in the German Democratic Republic—Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden—are launching a comprehensive appraisal and competition campaign in all aspects of their work, aiming to fulfill major economic tasks and strive for socialist victory.

These three cities are the industrial and cultural centers of the German Democratic Republic. They have a combined population of over 2.5 million, accounting for about one-seventh of the national population. The electrical machinery and equipment industry in Berlin and Dresden accounts for more than 50% of the total production of this industrial sector in the country. All three cities have a large number of factories manufacturing machine tools and general machinery. Humboldt University in Berlin, Karl Marx University in Leipzig, and the Dresden University of Technology are all world-renowned institutions of higher learning. The total number of students in these three schools also accounts for more than half of the total number of university students in the country. The central content of the competition among the three cities is to comprehensively fulfill production tasks in the manufacturing of electrical machinery, machine tools, general machinery, and construction engineering, to do a good job in urban supply and service work, and to carry out diverse social life activities in residential areas.

During the competition, the three cities will frequently organize exchanges of experience and mutual assistance. This appraisal and competition will be long-term. The leading bodies of the three cities have decided that the period from now until the Ninth Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (scheduled for May this year) will be the first stage of the competition.

Currently, all three cities are actively mobilizing workers and residents to participate in this appraisal and competition campaign. The first secretaries of the Socialist Unity Party committees of the three cities have jointly issued an appeal to the residents of these three cities to actively participate in the competition.

In Berlin, German Democratic Republic, a new atmosphere of "one helps all, and all help one" can be seen in the Collective Dormitory at 7 Marien Street.

Single residents receive special care. Mrs. Lina Scharl (left) and Mrs. Luzia Müller do their laundry for free. When young bachelor Wilhelm Mädel receives his clean and neatly ironed shirts, he is overjoyed.

In the collective family, people help each other and take care of each other. When old Mrs. Rützbusch falls ill, her neighbors, Mrs. Waltraut Schön (left) and Mrs. Luzia Müller, voluntarily come to take care of her.

The people living in the collective dormitory have decorated a small, comfortable cultural palace themselves. After work, they gather here to play chess, listen to music, and everyone gets along very harmoniously. German News Agency (Distributed by Xinhua News Agency)

    德三大城市展开全面评比竞赛运动

    新华社柏林11日电　在“为了和平和社会主义，一个带动一个，用共同的步伐前进”口号的鼓舞下，德意志民主共和国最大的三个城市——柏林、来比锡和德累斯顿正在以完成主要经济任务和争取社会主义胜利为目标，展开一个城市间的各方面工作的全面评比竞赛运动。
    这三个城市是德意志民主共和国的工业和文化中心。它们共拥有二百五十万以上的人口，约占全国人口的七分之一。柏林和德累斯顿两市的电机和电气器材工业的生产占全国这一工业部门总生产的50％以上。三个城市都有大量的制造机床和一般机械的工厂。柏林洪堡大学、来比锡卡尔·马克思大学和德累斯顿高等工业学院都是世界著名的高等学校。三个学校的学生总数也占全国高等学校学生总数的一半以上。三个城市竞赛的中心内容是：全面完成电机、机床和一般机器制造以及建筑工程方面的生产任务，做好城市供应和服务性工作，在居民住宅区中开展多方面的社会生活。
    在竞赛期间，三个城市将经常组织经验交流和相互帮助。这种评比竞赛将是长期性的。三个城市的领导机构决定，从现在到德国统一社会党九中全会的召开（今年五月）是竞赛的第一阶段。
    目前，三个城市都在积极动员职工和居民投入这一评比竞赛运动。三个城市的统一社会党委员会第一书记已经联名向这三个城市的居民发出积极参加竞赛的号召。（附图片）
    在德意志民主共和国柏林，马里恩大街七号集体宿舍里，可以看到一人帮大家，大家帮一人的新风气。
    单身住户得到了特殊的照顾。莉娜·沙耳太太（左）和露齐亚·米勒太太为他们免费洗衣服。年轻的单身汉威廉·迈德耳拿到为他洗得干净、烫得平整的衬衣时，真有说不出的高兴。
    在集体大家庭里人们互相帮助、彼此照顾。露齐布施老太太生病了，邻居瓦尔特劳特·舍恩太太（左）和露齐亚·米勒太太都主动来照顾她。
    住在集体宿舍里的人们，自己布置了小型舒适的文化宫。下班后，聚集在这里下棋，听音乐，大家十分融洽。德意志通讯社稿（新华社发）
