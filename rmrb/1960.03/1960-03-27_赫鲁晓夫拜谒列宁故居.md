Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 25th: TASS reports: Khrushchev visited Lenin's former residence on Marie-Rose Street in Paris this morning.

Tens of thousands of Parisians waited for Khrushchev's arrival on this street and adjacent streets. They held small red flags and small tricolor flags, as well as signs with "Peace" and "Long Live French-Soviet Friendship" written on them.

French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez, Secretary Jacques Duclos, and members of the French Communist Party's Political Bureau waited for Khrushchev at Lenin's former residence. Duclos accompanied Khrushchev up the narrow stairs to the house where Lenin lived. Thorez greeted him at the door.

Thorez said to Khrushchev, "We are very happy to welcome you in this simple house – where Lenin, the founder of the great socialist country, worked." Khrushchev warmly embraced Thorez.

Khrushchev visited the relics in Lenin's former residence.

The crowd chanted rhythmically in the street, "Khrushchev, come out to the balcony!", "Long Live French-Soviet Friendship!", "Long Live Peace!" The calls for "Khrushchev to come to the balcony" grew louder and louder. Khrushchev and Thorez stepped onto the balcony. The Parisians cheered enthusiastically for them.

The French Communist Party presented Khrushchev with a gift – a rare bound volume of government gazettes from the time of the Paris Commune.

    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：赫鲁晓夫今天上午参观了巴黎玛丽·萝丝街上的列宁故居。
    成千上万的巴黎人在这条街和毗邻的街道上等待赫鲁晓夫到来。他们手里拿着小红旗和三色小旗，还拿着标语牌，上面写着“和平”和“法苏友谊万岁”。
    法共中央总书记多列士、书记杜克洛和法共中央政治局的委员们在列宁故居等候赫鲁晓夫。杜克洛陪同赫鲁晓夫通过狭窄的楼梯走到列宁住过的房子。多列士在门口欢迎。
    多列士向赫鲁晓夫说，我们很高兴能在这间简朴的房子里——伟大的社会主义国家的奠基人列宁工作过的地方——欢迎您。赫鲁晓夫同多列士热烈拥抱。
    赫鲁晓夫参观了列宁故居里的遗物。
    群众在街上有节奏地欢呼“请赫鲁晓夫到阳台上来！”、“法苏友谊万岁！”、“和平万岁！”要求“赫鲁晓夫到阳台上来”的声音越来越响。赫鲁晓夫同多列士走上了阳台。巴黎人向他们热情欢呼。
    法共中央送给赫鲁晓夫一件礼物——罕有的巴黎公社时期的政府公报合订本。
