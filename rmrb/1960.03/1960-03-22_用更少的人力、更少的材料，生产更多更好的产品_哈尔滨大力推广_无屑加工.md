Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 21st. Workers in the mechanical manufacturing industry of Harbin are vigorously promoting "chipless machining" as an important measure to promote a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in the mechanical industry.

"Chipless machining" involves using precision casting and forging, stamping, pressing, extrusion, drawing, and rolling methods instead of lathe cutting during the production of product components. This method can not only shorten the production process and save man-hours but also effectively save raw materials.

In the past, mechanical manufacturing factories in Harbin had promoted this advanced technology on individual components and individual processes. However, due to the traditional thinking of a few cadres, who believed that mechanical manufacturing must be based on cutting and that blank production could not replace cutting, this advanced technology has not generally attracted people's attention. After Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory realized chipless machining in the production of electric vehicles (more than 2,000 parts) in February, it fundamentally broke this conventional thinking. The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China quickly promoted this experience and convened a conference on scientific and technological collaboration for vigorous thermal processing, calling on workers throughout the city to advance towards "chipless machining." The city's mechanical manufacturing industry, from large factories to small factories, has formulated plans to fully implement "chipless machining" for major components and products whenever possible, and to partially implement it when full implementation is not possible. In a short period of time, a climax of a major advance towards "chipless machining" was launched throughout the city. Many factories are directly assembling the cast and forged parts into finished products after adopting precision casting and forging, skipping the complicated cutting process, thereby producing more and better products with less manpower, less equipment, and fewer materials. Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has successfully trial-produced the first ten-horsepower winch using the new "chipless machining" method. The number of cold-processed workpieces such as turning, milling, and planing of this winch has been reduced from the original 112 to 7, the processing time has been reduced from the original 360 hours to 90 hours, saving 50% of pig iron and reducing the cost by more than 10%. After realizing "chipless machining" on the "201" electric vehicle, Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory has recently achieved basic "chipless machining" on 75-kilowatt hydro-generating units and coal planer. 43% of the product parts now produced by this factory have achieved "chipless machining." Another important aspect of "chipless machining" is vigorously promoting advanced processes such as stamping, pressing, extrusion, drawing, and rolling. In the past, Harbin Screw Factory used lathes to produce the heading dies for wood screws, which was inefficient, producing only 35 per shift. Due to improper heat treatment, there were many defective products, so punches were often in short supply. Now, after switching to cold rolling, the output per shift has increased to 54,800, which is equivalent to the output of a lathe for four years and one month, increasing efficiency by 1,500 times, and the quality can reach 98%, ensuring the production needs of the heading machine. The "chipless machining" cold-rolled trapezoidal thread cold rolling mill successfully trial-produced by the Boiler Factory increases production efficiency by 180 times compared with the original method of processing threads with ordinary lathes, saving 21 technicians and 123 square meters of production area, basically ending the old method of lathe workers processing threads. After the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory changed the milling of twist drill bits to cold-pressed twisting, each drill bit can save 40% of high-speed steel, and the production efficiency is increased by ten times.

In the process of advancing towards "chipless machining," scientific research institutions, universities, and factories throughout the city have widely carried out large-scale technical collaboration. Teachers and students from relevant majors of Harbin Institute of Technology and Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, as well as researchers from the Tool and Welding Research Institute, have recently formed a three-way combination team of more than 100 people with the technical workers of various factories, going deep into more than 30 factories to assist these factories in solving key technical problems of "chipless machining," which has played a great role in promoting "chipless machining" throughout the city.

### 用更少的人力、更少的材料，生产更多更好的产品  哈尔滨大力推广“无屑加工”

    哈尔滨大力推广“无屑加工”
    新华社哈尔滨21日电　哈尔滨市机械制造业职工大力推广“无屑加工”，以它作为推动机械工业实现全面持续大跃进的一项重要措施。
    “无屑加工”就是在生产产品部件时，采用精密铸锻和冲、压、挤、拔、轧等方法代替车床切削加工。这种方法不但可以缩短生产过程，节约工时，还可以有效地节省原料材料。
    哈尔滨机械制造工厂过去在个别部件、个别工序上也曾推广过这一先进工艺，但是，由于少数干部存在着传统观念，认为机械制造必须以切削加工为主，毛坯生产不能代替切削加工。因此，这项先进工艺一直没有普遍引起人们的重视。哈尔滨建成机械厂2月份在生产电瓶车（二千多个零件）时实现了无屑加工后，从根本上打破了这种习俗观念。中共哈尔滨市委迅速推广了这一经验，并且召开了大搞热加工科学技术协作工作大会，号召全市职工向“无屑加工”进军。全市机械制造工业，从大厂到小厂，纷纷制订规划，对主要部件和产品，能全部实行“无屑加工”的就全部实行，不能全部实行的就部分实行。短期内在全市范围内掀起了向“无屑加工”大进军的高潮。许多工厂在采用精密铸、锻后，就直接把铸、锻成的零、部件组装为成品，跳越繁杂的切削加工过程，从而以更少的人力、更少的设备、更少的材料，生产出更多的产品，更好的产品。哈尔滨第一机械厂用“无屑加工”新方法已经试制成功了第一台十马力卷扬机。这台卷扬机的车、铣、刨等冷加工工件由原来的一百一十二件减少到七件，加工工时由原来的三百六十小时减少到九十小时，节约生铁50％，降低成本10％以上。哈尔滨建成机械厂在继“二○一”型电瓶车实现“无屑加工”后，最近又在七十五瓩水轮发电机组和刨煤机上实现基本“无屑加工”。这个厂现在生产的产品零、部件，已有43％实现了“无屑加工”。“无屑加工”的另一个重要方面，是大力推行冲、压、挤、拔、轧等先进工艺。哈尔滨螺钉厂过去生产木螺丝打头冲模子是用车床车制的，效率低，每班只能生产三十五个，又因热处理不当，废品较多，因而冲子经常供不应求。现在改为冷轧后，每班产量提高到五万四千八百个，等于一台车床四年零一个月的产量，提高效率一千五百倍，质量可达到98％，保证了打头机生产需要。锅炉厂试制成功的“无屑加工”冷轧梯形螺纹冷轧机，比原来用普通车床加工螺纹提高生产效率一百八十倍，节省了二十一名技工和一百二十三平方米生产面积，基本结束了车工加工螺纹的老方法。量具刃具厂把麻花钻头由铣制改为冷压扭制后，每个可节约高速钢40％，生产效率提高十倍。
    在向“无屑加工”进军过程中，全市科学研究机关、大专学校和工厂间广泛地开展了技术大协作。哈尔滨工业大学、黑龙江工学院有关专业师生和工具、焊接研究所的研究人员，最近已和各工厂的技术工人一起，组成一支一百多名的三结合队伍，分别深入三十多个工厂，协助这些工厂解决“无屑加工”技术关键问题，对推动全市“无屑加工”起了很大作用。
