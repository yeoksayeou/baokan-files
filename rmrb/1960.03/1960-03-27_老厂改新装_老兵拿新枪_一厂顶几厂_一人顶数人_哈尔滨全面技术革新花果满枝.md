Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 26th: Harbin's technological innovation and technological revolution have formed into a city-wide mass movement. Highly scientific new equipment and tools are emerging in large numbers, and the technological landscape of the city's major national economic production sectors is undergoing fundamental changes.

Currently, in addition to factories, basic construction, and transportation departments, the vast majority of the masses in universities, scientific research institutions, shops, cafeterias, hotels, banks, streets, and rural people's communes throughout the city have been involved in the movement. Many ordinary workers, service personnel, university students, chefs, childcare workers, street residents have become outstanding designers, engineers, and inventors of mechanization and automation in this movement. Chefs in restaurants and cafeterias have created automatic dumpling production lines, steamed bun machines, vegetable cutting machines, and other cooking tools, achieving "no walking for delivering dishes, no hands for cutting vegetables, no kneading for dough, everything at the touch of a button." Shop salespersons have created automatic vending machines. Bank employees have created money counting machines. Firefighters have created the miracle of "Twenty-Three Automatic Fire Fighting," where at the instant of a fire alarm, a person dresses, the lights turn on, the doors open, the fire truck starts, the bell rings, and twenty-three actions can start simultaneously, greatly shortening the time to dispatch the fire truck. Childcare workers in nurseries have created automatic baby bedwetting signal devices. Street police station personnel have created local telephone conference equipment. Employees of pig farms in rural areas have achieved automated pig farming lines, creating the miracle of one person raising three thousand pigs. From the urban area to the counties, from production to life, from large and medium-sized enterprises to small enterprises, technological revolution flowers are blooming everywhere, bearing abundant fruits.

Harbin's technological innovation movement is not just a general technical reform, but also has the nature of comprehensive technological transformation. After the movement unfolded, many factories and enterprises in the city saw tremendous and historically significant changes of "old factories getting new looks, veteran workers getting new weapons; new factories being even more advanced, new workers becoming veteran workers; one factory doing the work of several, one person doing the work of many." The modern Harbin Flax Factory, newly built after liberation, has already achieved six automated production lines, including combing into strips and slurry sizing. This reform has saved more than 3,000 square meters of building area and complete sets of rinsing equipment, greatly changing the factory's technical landscape. The soft shaft production workshop of the modern Electric Meter Instrument Factory, after realizing full workshop automation, has become a workshop with only two people. Its products, in addition to meeting the needs of the Changchun Automobile Factory, can also supply the entire country. The Jincheng Hardware Factory, an industrial enterprise run by the district, has also fully automated its workshops producing hairpins, thimbles, cotton gin saw blades and other products under extremely simple material conditions. The Eighth District Grain Processing Factory used some existing scrap materials to build an automated production line for storing, transporting, and processing grain, using eight people to operate it instead of the original 257 people's heavy manual labor. These facts prove that modern large factories can greatly engage in mechanization and automation, and old and small enterprises can also achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization, and even "leap to the sky" into automation under certain conditions.

The vigorous mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement in Harbin has a strong scientific nature. Many creations can truly be called "ingenious," fully in line with scientific laws. For a century, the processing of bristles has been done by hand and teeth, and the production method was very backward. This time, the workers of the Harbin Bristle Factory have succeeded in mechanization and automation. At the beginning, some people doubted, saying, "Is it possible to create mechanized and automated equipment to make a pile of messy bristles neat and tidy, roots down, tips up, arranged in teams by height, and tied into bundles of different sizes?" However, the workers of this factory, based on their decades of labor experience, summarized the scientific laws of bristle processing, simulated the actions of past manual operations, and created ingenious mechanized and automated devices, achieving mechanized bristle processing. Even many mechanical design experts were astonished by the workers' creations, believing that this was an astonishing miracle that "scholars" without practical labor experience would hardly have imagined.

The city-wide, scientific technological innovation and technological revolution movement has brought about a new great leap forward in production in Harbin. The movement has brought six major benefits to production: (1) Production efficiency has been significantly improved. For example, the automatic tap production line created by the Measuring Tool & Cutting Tool Factory has reduced the processing time for each tap from 48 seconds to 6 seconds, and the annual output has increased from 330,000 pieces to 2.7 million pieces. The automatic hairpin production line created by the Jincheng Hardware Factory has increased the daily output from 1,300 to 70,460, increasing efficiency by 44 times. (2) The working conditions of workers have been thoroughly improved, and the intensity of labor has been greatly reduced. For example, the Eighth District Grain Processing Factory has realized "dust-free workshops" due to the mechanization and automation of grain storage, transportation, and processing. In the past, the dust content in each cubic meter of air in the workshop was 50 milligrams, but now it has been reduced to 1.3 milligrams. The meat processing plant's grinders happily said after realizing mechanization, "In the past, three and a half circles, sweating all over; now press the button, people sit and the machine turns." (3) A large amount of labor has been saved, and labor productivity has been improved. Since the Electric Meter Instrument Factory has greatly engaged in mechanization and automation, it has used the saved workers to form a new workshop of 150 people. As a result of the city's large-scale mechanization and automation, labor productivity in February this year increased by 117% compared with the same period last year, and increased by 86% compared with the average labor productivity for the whole year. (4) The quality of products has been effectively improved, and the operating area, equipment, tools, raw materials, and materials have been saved in large quantities, and costs have been reduced. (5) The production cycle has been greatly shortened. For example, after the Songjiang Food Chemical Factory created an automatic soy sauce production line, the soy sauce production cycle was reduced from 14 days to 6 days; the automatic lead screw machine of the Harbin Machine Tool Factory reduced the production cycle from 24 hours to 1.5 hours. (6) Workers have learned new production skills. In the process of vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, the vast number of employees worked hard to study, asking questions if they didn't understand, and learning if they couldn't. Countless worker "designers," "engineers," "local experts," and "all-rounders" have emerged.

    老厂改新装　老兵拿新枪　一厂顶几厂　一人顶数人
    哈尔滨全面技术革新花果满枝
    据新华社哈尔滨26日电　哈尔滨市的技术革新和技术革命，已经形成为一个席卷全城的全民运动，具有高度科学性的新设备、新工具大量涌现出来，全市国民经济主要生产部门的技术面貌，正发生着根本的变化。
    目前，全市除工厂、基本建设、交通运输部门以外，大专学校、科学研究机关、商店、食堂、旅馆、银行、街道和农村人民公社，绝大部分群众都已卷入运动。许多普通工人、服务人员、大学生、厨师、保育员、街道居民，在这次运动中成了出色的机械化自动化的设计师、工艺师和发明家。饭店和食堂的厨师们创造了包饺子自动线、馒头机、切菜机等炊事工具，实现了“送菜不用走，切菜不用手，和面不用揉，一切按电纽”；商店售货员创制了自动售货机；银行职工创造了点钞机；消防队员创出了“二十三自动救火”的奇迹，只要一有火警，在同一刹那间，人穿衣，灯自亮，门自开，车自出，铃自响，二十三种动作可以一齐开始，大大缩短了出车救火的时间；托儿所的保育员创制了小孩尿床自动信号器；街道派出所人员创造了土电话会议设备；农村中的养猪场职工实现了养猪自动线，创一人养三千头猪的奇迹。全市从市区到各县，从生产到生活，从大中型企业到小型企业，到处都开放出了技术革命的鲜花，结出了丰硕的果实。
    哈尔滨市的技术革新运动，不仅是一般的技术改革，而且带有全面技术改造的性质。运动展开后，全市许多工厂、企业都出现了“老厂改新装，老兵拿新枪；新厂更尖新，新兵变老兵；一厂顶几厂，一人顶数人”的有历史意义的巨大变化。解放后新建的现代化哈尔滨亚麻厂，已经实现了栉梳成条、漂沙上浆等六条自动化生产线，这一改革节省出了三千多平方米的建筑面积和整套的漂洗设备，使全厂技术面貌大为改观。现代化的电表仪器厂软轴生产车间实现全车间生产自动化后，已经成为一个只有两个人的车间，它所生产的产品，除了满足长春汽车厂的需要外，还可供给全国。区办工业金城五金厂，在极为简陋的物质条件下，生产发卡、顶针、弹棉机锯条等产品的车间，也全部实现了自动化。八区粮食加工厂利用原有的一些残材废料建成了一条储运加工粮食的自动化生产线，用八个人操作代替了原来二百五十七人的笨重体力劳动。这些事实证明，现代化的大厂可以大搞机械化、自动化，旧企业和小企业同样可以实现机械化、半机械化，在一定条件下甚至可以“一步登天”地进入自动化。
    如火如荼的哈尔滨市群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，具有强烈的科学性。许多创造真正称得上“巧夺天工”，完全符合科学规律。一个世纪以来，加工猪鬃一直是用手和牙齿来进行，生产方式非常落后。这次哈尔滨猪鬃厂工人却搞成了机械化、自动化。开始时有人怀疑说：“要创造机械化自动化设备，把一堆乱七八糟的猪鬃弄得整整齐齐，根朝下，梢朝上，高矮排成队，按不同尺寸一束一束地扎起来，这是可能的吗？”但是，这个厂的工人们根据自己几十年的劳动经验，总结了猪鬃加工的科学规律，模拟着过去使用双手操作的动作，制成了精巧的机械化、自动化装置，实现了猪鬃加工机械化。就连许多机械设计专家看了工人们的创造都咋舌，认为这是没有劳动实践经验的“学者”很难设想到的惊人奇迹。
    全民性的、科学性的技术革新和技术革命运动，使哈尔滨市出现了新的生产大跃进。运动给生产带来了六大好处：（一）生产效率显著提高。如量具刃具厂创造的丝锥自动化生产线，使每件丝锥的加工工时由四十八秒钟减为六秒钟，年产量由三十三万件一下子提高到二百七十万件。金城五金厂创制的发卡自动生产线，使日产量由一千三百个增为七万零四百六十个，提高效率四十四倍。（二）彻底改善了工人的劳动条件，大大减轻了劳动强度。如：八区粮食加工厂由于实现了粮食的储、运、加工机械化、自动化，已经实现了“无尘车间”，过去车间里每立方米空气中含尘五十毫克，现在已降为一点三毫克。肉类加工厂的磨碎工人实现机械化后高兴地说：“过去三圈半，累得一身汗；如今按电钮，人坐机器转”。（三）节省了大量劳动力，提高了劳动生产率。电表仪器厂大搞机械化自动化以来，已用节省下来的工人组成了一个一百五十人的新车间。全市由于大搞机械化自动化的结果，今年2月份的劳动生产率比去年同期增长117％，比全年平均劳动生产率提高86％。（四）有效地提高了产品质量，大量地节省了作业面积和设备、工具、原料、材料，降低了成本。（五）大大地缩短了生产周期。如松江食品化学厂创制酱油自动生产线后，酱油生产周期由十四天减为六天；哈尔滨机床厂的丝杠自动化机床，使生产周期由二十四小时减为一点五小时。（六）使工人学会了新的生产技能。在大搞机械化、自动化中，广大职工苦心钻研，不懂就问，不会就学，出现了无数工人“设计师”、“工艺师”、“土专家”和“多面手”。
