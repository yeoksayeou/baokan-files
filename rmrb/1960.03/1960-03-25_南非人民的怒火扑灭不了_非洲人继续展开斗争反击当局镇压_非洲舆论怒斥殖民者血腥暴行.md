Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 24th: Despite the South African Federal Government's exhaustive and cruel suppression in recent days, it cannot extinguish the flames of the South African people's struggle against the "Pass Laws." Not only have Africans not been intimidated, but they are also preparing to launch a larger-scale struggle.

The exiled President of the African National Congress, Luthuli, today called on Africans not to go to work on the 28th to protest the white authorities' bloody suppression and oppose the "Pass Laws." He called: "Let every African man, woman, and child, and all other sections of the people, take March 28th as a day of mourning for our dead brothers and sisters."

At midnight on the 23rd, a new large-scale protest erupted in Nyanga township, an African settlement on the outskirts of Cape Town. Roadblocks were set up throughout the town to prevent police patrols. All whites who entered the town were immediately driven away by Africans.

In many places, Africans continue to strike, buses are suspended, traffic is paralyzed, and factories cannot operate.

At the same time, political organizations have strongly protested the South African Federal Government's brutal suppression in recent days.

In a protest telegram sent to South African Federal Prime Minister Verwoerd on the 23rd, the African National Congress of South Africa said that regarding the authorities' atrocities in massacring Africans, "the African National Congress strongly protests and warns that the African people are extremely indignant about the police brutality in Vereeniging and Langa, which caused the deaths of so many innocent people." The telegram demanded the immediate abolition of the "Pass Laws" and all discriminatory laws.

In a statement on the 22nd, the South African Liberal Party pointed out that "this unrest and the resulting terrible deaths are entirely the result of apartheid, and unless immediate steps are taken to repeal the oppressive laws that weigh so heavily on the non-white residents, the situation will become even more serious."

The Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa demanded that the authorities immediately withdraw the military police attempting to further suppress the Africans.

Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: The Permanent Secretariat of the All-African Peoples' Conference, the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, and public opinion in African countries have condemned the South African Federal authorities' bloody suppression of unarmed African people and expressed support for the South African people's just struggle against racial discrimination and for basic human rights.

In a statement issued in Accra on the 23rd, the Permanent Secretariat of the All-African Peoples' Conference said that the All-African Peoples' Conference was shocked by the South African authorities' police's shameless shooting of Africans. "The All-African Peoples' Conference condemns the South African government for taking such brutal actions in the mid-twentieth century."

The statement said that the South African authorities, in addition to implementing racial discrimination and apartheid policies, are now cruelly massacring African people, which has caused widespread indignation among African people who are fighting for independence and freedom.

In a telegram sent to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 23rd, the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council strongly condemned "the South African Federal Government's barbaric atrocities against the African people—whose only crime is demanding dignity and human rights."

On the 23rd, nine African countries in the United Nations issued a statement condemning the South African authorities' suppression of the African people as a serious violation of the charter and principles of the United Nations Charter.

On the 23rd, the United Arab Republic's Deputy Undersecretary of State for Presidential Affairs, Abdel Kader Hatem, said that the United Arab Republic strongly condemned this inhumane crime that caused the death and injury of hundreds of Africans. He said that the United Arab Republic declared its support for the position of the African people against the barbaric atrocities of the South African Federal authorities.

Liberian Secretary of State Grimes said on the 23rd, "The Liberian government strongly opposes and abhors this organized, cold-blooded, cruel, and despicable massacre of unarmed African people."

Nyasaland African National Congress Propaganda Secretary Chiume, Ugandan National Congress Foreign Affairs Secretary Keir, and Kenyan People's Congress Party Secretary-General Masenga, in a joint telegram to the United Nations Secretary-General on the 23rd, demanded the immediate expulsion of the South African Federal Government from the United Nations because it was cruelly inhumane and massacred African people. The telegram condemned the South African authorities' apartheid policy, believing that it seriously threatens African peace and security.

The Equatorial African Bureau of the African Association in Cairo issued a statement on the 24th condemning the South African Federal Government's barbaric massacre of Africans.

The "Ethiopian Herald" wrote, "The South African Federation is currently implementing an open policy of tyranny against ten million Africans nationwide." The newspaper pointed out that the South African authorities shot the demonstrators simply because they demanded basic human rights.

The Ethiopian "New Times" weekly condemned the South African Federal authorities' massacre as a "bestial act."

    被流放的非洲人国民大会主席卢图利今天号召非洲人在28日都不去上工，抗议白人当局的血腥镇压和反对“通行证法”。他号召：“每一个非洲男人、女人和儿童以及人民的所有其他阶层，以3月28日作为悼念我们死去的兄弟姊妹的哀悼日”。
    23日午夜，开普敦郊外非洲人聚居的尼安加镇又爆发了新的大规模抗议。镇上到处设立了路障，阻止警察的巡逻。所有走进这个镇的白人都被非洲人立即赶走。
    许多地方非洲人继续举行罢工，公共汽车停驶，交通瘫痪，工厂无法开工。
    同时，各政党组织纷纷强烈抗议南非联邦政府连日来的残暴镇压。
    南非非洲人国民大会在23日拍给南非联邦总理维沃尔德的抗议电报中说，对当局惨杀非洲人的暴行，“非洲人国民大会提出强烈抗议，并提出警告，非洲人民对于未里尼琴和兰加的警察暴行而使这么多无辜的人死亡表示极大的愤慨”。电报要求立即废除“通行证法”和一切歧视性法律。
    南非自由党22日在一篇声明中指出，“这次骚乱和因而发生可怕的死亡完全是种族隔离政策的结果，除非立即采取步骤来取消如此沉重的压在非白人居民身上的镇压法律，否则，事件更为严重。”
    南非泛非主义者大会要求当局立即撤退企图进一步镇压非洲人的军警。

    阿联负责总统事务副国务部长阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·哈特姆23日说，阿联强烈谴责这种使成百非洲人死伤的无人性的罪行。他说，阿联宣布它支持非洲各国人民反对南非联邦当局这种野蛮暴行的立场。
    利比里亚国务秘书格兰姆斯23日说，“利比里亚政府强烈反对和憎恶对手无寸铁的非洲人民进行这个有组织的、冷酷的、残忍的和卑鄙的大屠杀。”

    开罗的非洲人协会赤道非洲局24日发表声明，谴责南非联邦政府对非洲人的野蛮屠杀。
      “埃塞俄比亚先驱报”写道，“南非联邦目前对全国一千万非洲人实行公开的暴政方针。”这家报纸指出，南非当局所以枪杀示威者，只不过是因为他们要求取得起码的人道权利。
    埃塞俄比亚“新时代”周刊谴责南非联邦当局的屠杀行动是“兽性行动”。
