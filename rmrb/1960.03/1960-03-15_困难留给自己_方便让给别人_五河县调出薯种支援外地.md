Keeping Difficulties to Ourselves, Offering Convenience to Others
Wuhe County Transfers Sweet Potato Seedlings to Support Other Areas

(Our Report) Anhui Province’s Wuhe County, promoting the spirit of collaboration and mutual assistance, has transferred four million jin of sweet potato seeds to support counties lacking seeds. Although Wuhe County has a relatively abundant supply of sweet potato seedlings for seed, the expansion of the spring-sown sweet potato area and the increase in planting density have significantly increased the demand for seeds. This spring, some areas lacking seeds requested support from Wuhe County, and the communes in Wuhe County regarded supporting seed-deficient counties as a glorious task. The county adopted three measures – “excavating, increasing, and saving” – to tap the potential of sweet potato seedlings. "Excavating" means using other grains to compensate for the fresh sweet potatoes that each commune and brigade planned to use as food rations, leaving the fresh sweet potatoes for use as seeds. "Increasing" means adopting all advanced seedling cultivation methods to increase the production of sweet potato seedlings. "Saving" means not wasting an inch of sweet potato vine when cutting seedlings and planting. Through all parties tapping potential and devising solutions, the county transferred out four million jin of sweet potato seeds. In order to transport the sweet potato seedlings out in a timely manner, the county mobilized a large number of vehicles and boats for transportation, and organized more than 700 people to weave mats and sacks to solve the packaging problem, ensuring that the sweet potato seedlings supporting other counties were delivered to various places in a timely manner.

    困难留给自己　方便让给别人
    五河县调出薯种支援外地
    本报讯　安徽省五河县发扬协作互助精神，调出甘薯种四百万斤，支援缺种县。五河县的甘薯留种虽然比较充裕，由于扩大了春播甘薯的面积，提高了栽种密度，种子的需要量也大大增加了。今春，有些缺种的地区要求五河县给以支援，五河县各公社把支援缺种县当作光荣的任务。全县采取了“挖、增、省”三项措施，挖掘薯种的潜力。“挖”就是把各公社、大队计划做口粮的鲜薯，用其他粮食抵换，留下鲜薯做薯种用。“增”就是采取一切先进的育苗办法，增产薯苗。“省”就是在剪裁薯苗和栽种时，不浪费一寸薯秧。经过各方面挖潜力、想办法，全县调出了四百万斤薯种。为了及时把薯种运出，全县抽调了大量车船运输工具，并组织了七百多人打席子、编席包，解决包装问题，保证把支援外县的薯种及时运到各地。
