Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 22nd: A battle mobilization meeting to accelerate the greening of the Loess Plateau, harness the Yellow River, and ensure the longevity of the Sanmenxia Reservoir—the Shaanxi Provincial Youth Greening Loess Plateau Great Leap Forward Conference—was held in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an from March 10th to 19th.

The conference passed a resolution calling on the youth of the province to: set lofty aspirations, eliminate the three pests (drought, wind and sand, soil erosion), and act as heroic shock troops in conquering nature.

The conference believes that since the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference in 1956, under the wise leadership of the Party, and illuminated by the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, Shaanxi Province has achieved great successes in greening and soil and water conservation. At present, the province's forest coverage rate has increased from 10.16% four years ago to 20.87%, and the area of controlled soil erosion has also increased from 8,736 square kilometers to 63,667 square kilometers.

The conference also called on the youth of the province to actively take the lead in promoting the experience of large-scale, high-speed, and high-standard mountain management in Donggou, Tongchuan City, and Gaoxigou, Mizhi County, as well as the "Ten Experiences" of planting trees and grasses, diverting water to pull sand, etc., and carrying out "Ten Activities" in Liu Guiwan and Hailiutan areas of Yulin Prefecture.

Youth representatives from the seven provinces (regions) of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Henan, Qinghai, and Shaanxi in the Loess Plateau region also jointly proposed a letter of determination at the meeting to accelerate greening, control wind and sand, and transform the Loess Plateau into a green plateau in a not-too-long period of time.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, March 22nd: The Jiangsu Provincial Youth Oath-Taking Conference to March towards Barren Hills, Wasteland, and Barren Beaches, held in Xuzhou, successfully closed in Huaiyin City on the 18th.

Attending this conference were 350 representatives from the forestry front in Jiangsu Province, as well as 190 representatives from ten provinces and cities, including Shandong, Shanghai, Liaoning, Beijing, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Zhejiang, and Fujian, who were invited to attend the conference. The conference proposed a red flag competition initiative to the youth of the country to develop "Three Barrens" to get treasures.

In their "Letter of Determination" to the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all the youth representatives of Jiangsu Province said, we will certainly unite the broad masses of youth and the people of the province to resolutely realize the long-term greening and afforestation plan proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. We will draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on the barren hills, wasteland, and barren beaches, build a green Great Wall on the thousands of miles of beaches, turn the barren hills and ridges into lush forests and bamboo seas, turn the eight hundred li of the old Yellow River course into fruit and wood forest belts, and make Jiangsu more prosperous and beautiful.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 22nd: A mass spring tree-planting campaign is widely underway in rural areas across Tibet. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10 million poplar, willow, pine, cypress, and various fruit trees have been planted in Lhasa, Shannan, and Nyingchi, where thawing occurred earlier; among them, Shannan alone, which started earlier, has planted more than 8.3 million trees. In the colder regions of Xigaze, Gyantse, and Nagqu, people are actively digging ditches, building canals, and preparing seedlings.

Mass tree planting is happening for the first time in Tibet. In the past, all the forests in Tibet were occupied by the three major lords and were arbitrarily destroyed by them, so farmers were not very enthusiastic about planting trees. This year, after the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region issued a call for everyone to plant trees, the broad masses of emancipated peasants responded enthusiastically, bringing tents and carrying pots and pans, eating and living on the construction sites during the afforestation assault days and assault weeks.

In the past, there were very few fruit trees and flowers in many parts of Tibet. This year, special attention has been paid to planting apples, pears, peaches, walnuts, and other fruit trees and flowers that are suitable for growing in Tibet during tree planting.

    陕西江苏青年立志加速绿化荒山荒地
    西藏农民大种杨、柳、松、柏和果树
    据新华社延安22日电　一个为加速绿化黄土高原、根治黄河和确保三门峡水库延年益寿的战斗动员大会——陕西省青年绿化黄土高原跃进大会，于3月10日到19日在革命圣地延安召开。
    会议通过决议，号召全省青年：立大志，除三害（干旱、风沙、水土流失），作征服大自然的英勇突击队。
    会议认为，从1956年五省（区）青年造林大会以来，在党的英明领导下，由于总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀，陕西省绿化和水土保持工作都取得了巨大的成就。目前，全省森林复盖率由四年前的10．16％提高到20．87％，控制水土流失面积也由八千七百三十六平方公里，提高到六万三千六百六十七平方公里。
    会议还号召全省青年，要积极带头推广铜川市东沟、米脂县高西沟的大规模、高速度、高标准治山的经验，和榆林专区刘贵湾、海流滩等地植树种草、引水拉沙等“十项经验”和开展“十大活动”的经验。
    黄土高原地区的山西、内蒙古、宁夏、甘肃、河南、青海、陕西七省（区）的青年代表，也在会上联合提出了加速绿化、制服风沙，在不太长的时间内变黄土高原为绿色高原的决心书。
    据新华社淮阴22日电　江苏省青年在徐州举行的向荒山、荒地、荒滩进军誓师大会18日在淮阴市胜利闭幕。
    出席这次大会的有江苏省林业战线上的三百五十名代表，还有应邀出席大会的山东、上海、辽宁、北京、安徽、江西、河南、河北、浙江、福建等十个省、市的一百九十名代表。大会向全国青少年提出了开展向“三荒”要万宝的红旗竞赛倡议。
    江苏省全体青年代表在给中共江苏省委的“决心书”中说，我们一定团结全省广大青年和全省人民一道，坚决实现省委提出的绿化造林远景规划。我们要在荒山、荒地、荒滩上，画下最新最美的图画，在千里海滩上筑起绿色长城，把荒山秃岭变成茂林竹海，把八百里黄河故道沙龙，变成果木林带，使江苏变得更富饶更美丽。
    据新华社拉萨22日电　西藏各地农村广泛开展群众性的春季植树造林运动。据不完全统计，解冻较早的拉萨、山南、林芝等地目前已种上的杨、柳、松、柏以及各种果树有一千多万株；其中，动手早的山南一地种了八百三十多万株。气候较寒冷的日喀则、江孜、黑河等地目前正积极挖沟修渠、准备树苗。
    群众性的植树造林运动在西藏还是第一次。过去西藏的林木全被三大领主霸占，并被他们任意破坏，因而农民植树的积极性不高。今年，当西藏自治区筹委会发出人人动手植树造林的号召以后，广大翻身农民热烈响应，在造林突击日和突击周中，他们带着帐篷、背着锅壶，在工地吃住。
    过去西藏许多地方很少果树和花草。今年各地在植树造林时特别注意种植苹果、梨、桃、核桃等适宜在西藏生长的果树和花草。
