    Two Poems on Fighting Drought
    Jiang He
    Water Grasped in the Hands of the Commune Members
    The great river is dried, the sea is withered,
    But the irrigation ditches in the fields flow without cease!
    The rocks are baked, the earth is scorched,
    Yet the green seedlings do not bow their heads!
    It’s not that the irrigation channels reach the Dragon's Mouth,
    But that the water is grasped in the hands of the commune members!
    It’s not that the seedlings have divine protection,
    But that the seedlings grow in the soil of the commune!
    A Hundred Li Singing in Chorus of a Bumper Harvest
    A thousand people, one mind,
    A thousand bright moons dropped into a water basin;
    Splashing moonlight, splashing silver,
    Ten li of wheat fields glittering!
    One basin of water, ten nests of seedlings,
    A thousand red suns reflected in the basin;
    Splashing sunshine, splashing heart,
    A hundred li singing in chorus of a bumper harvest!

    抗旱二首
    江河
    水抓在社员的手
    大河晒干海晒枯，
    地里的水渠不断流！
    石头晒化地晒熟，
    青青的禾苗不低头！
    不是水渠通龙口，
    是水抓在社员的手！
    不是禾苗有神护，
    是禾苗生在公社的土！
    百里齐唱丰收调
    千个人，一股劲，
    千轮明月掉水盆；
    泼上月光泼上银，
    十里麦地亮晶晶！
    一盆水，十窝苗，
    千个红日盆中照；
    泼上太阳泼上心，
    百里齐唱丰收调！
