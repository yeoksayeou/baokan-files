Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 5th: Today in Havana, 500,000 people participated in the funeral of the victims of the "La Coubre" ship explosion and an angry demonstration protesting the U.S.'s criminal atrocities.

Cuban Prime Minister Castro, President Dorticós, and all members of the revolutionary government walked hand-in-hand in the vast crowd of people attending the funeral procession.

The land, naval, and police forces of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces began the march from the Cuban Workers' Confederation building. Joining them were contingents of militia and youth patrol teams composed of workers, farmers, students, professionals, and women. The procession passed through the streets, lined with people from all walks of life, who, like the rest of the nation, mourned the dead and condemned the evil saboteurs.

Speaking at the cemetery, Castro said that the explosion of the "La Coubre" was caused by sabotage premeditatedly prepared at the port of embarkation, and the investigation confirmed this. Castro said that the instigators of the sabotage should be sought among officials of the U.S. government, which had exerted pressure to prevent Cuba from purchasing weapons needed to defend its sovereignty. Castro said that the U.S. military attaché and consuls pressured the Belgian government not to sell weapons to Cuba, and when this plot failed, they prepared this criminal act of sabotage. Castro said this was another instance of interference to prevent Cuba from obtaining weapons. Castro recalled that the U.S. had supplied weapons to Batista's executioners, but its attitude toward the revolutionary government was completely different because the revolutionary government had liberated the people from the oppression of monopoly organizations and large landowners.

Castro pointed out that this was not an isolated incident. The people who carried out this criminal sabotage were the same ones whose planes took off from their territory to set fire to Cuban sugarcane fields and bomb Cuban cities. Castro said that the person who first bombed Havana last October is still walking freely on the streets of the United States.

Castro condemned the sugar law proposed by the U.S. authorities to Congress as a new Platt Amendment (a famous act passed by the U.S. Congress at the beginning of this century interfering in Cuba's internal affairs - editor's note). According to this law, the U.S. president can arbitrarily change the sugar quota in the U.S. market, attempting to carry out economic retaliation against the Cuban revolution in this way.

Castro reminded people to pay attention to the U.S. military exercises to be held in the Caribbean Sea, which are aimed at intimidating and threatening the Cuban people with invasion. Castro said, "We are not afraid of any invading army. Any man or woman in the Cuban people will not hesitate for a second to take up arms and defend the motherland." Castro said that he hoped that irrationality would not confuse the invaders' judgment, but if they invaded Cuba regardless, the entire nation would fight to the last drop of blood. The Cuban revolution will never retreat and will continue to move forward.

According to official, incomplete statistics so far, 333 people were injured and 72 people died in the explosion.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 5th: All over Cuba today, in accordance with the decision of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, a national strike of six to twenty-four hours was held to mourn the victims of the counter-revolutionary "La Coubre" explosion on the 4th. All the militias are holding national mourning demonstrations and protests. They are also holding vigil in the building of the Cuban Workers' Confederation. The national flag is flying at half-mast today to mourn the dead.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation issued a statement saying that the U.S. imperialists and all international reactionaries know that the Cuban revolution is a banner held high by the people of Latin American countries, so they are madly opposed to it. However, despite their aggression, they will never be able to suppress the revolution. Every attack by the enemy will make the people and the working class more determined to rise up and defend the revolution.

The Cuban University Students Federation, the Cuban Women's Congress for Latin American Liberation, the Cuban Revolutionary Women's League, grassroots trade unions, peasant associations, Catholic groups, professional groups, and cultural organizations have all issued condemnations and condolences to the dead.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 5th: The Cuban "Revolución" newspaper said today that increasingly complete investigations show that criminals directed by those who instigated anti-Cuban international conspiracies caused the "La Coubre" explosion. "Revolución" said that many details confirm this assertion.

The newspaper said that a 26-year-old American named Donald Chapman had traveled on the ship. He claimed to be a reporter for United Press International and was traveling as a passenger. Chapman took photos on the ship. "Revolución" pointed out that all of this showed that Chapman knew that there were weapons on the ship, and the United States also knew that these weapons were being transported to Cuba. Chapman has been arrested by the Cuban revolutionary authorities.

"Revolución" commented that it is well known that the United States has exerted diplomatic pressure to make all countries refuse to sell weapons to Cuba. "Revolución" pointed out that those who carry out economic aggression against Cuba, direct the burning of Cuban sugarcane fields from the air, and employ war criminals for their barbaric purposes cannot be unconnected with yesterday's murder.

    古巴举国悲愤敌忾同仇
    哈瓦那五十万人大示威抗议美国野蛮罪行
    卡斯特罗指出应该从美国政府官员中寻找祸首
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　今天哈瓦那有五十万人参加了“勒库布尔号”轮船爆炸中死难者的葬礼和抗议美国罪恶暴行的愤怒的示威游行。
    古巴总理卡斯特罗、总统多尔蒂科斯和革命政府的全部成员手挽着手走在参加送葬的浩浩荡荡的人民队伍当中。
    古巴革命武装部队的陆、海军和警察部队从古巴工人联合会的大厦起开始列队示威。同他们一起参加游行的有由工人、农民、学生、自由职业者和妇女组成的民兵队伍和青年巡逻队的队伍。游行队伍经过了大街，在街道的两旁站满了各个社会阶层的人，他们也和全国一样为死难者志哀和谴责罪恶的破坏者。
    卡斯特罗在公墓发表讲话说，“勒库布尔号”的爆炸事件是在起载港口蓄谋准备的破坏造成的，所作的调查证实了这一点。卡斯特罗说，应该从美国政府的官员中寻找进行破坏的祸首，美国政府曾经施加压力阻止古巴购买保卫主权所需要的武器。卡斯特罗说，美国武官和领事向比利时政府施加压力不让它向古巴出售武器，当这个图谋失败之后就准备了这次罪恶的破坏。卡斯特罗说，这是为防止古巴得到武器而再次进行的干涉。卡斯特罗回顾说，美国曾经把武器供应给巴蒂斯塔的刽子手，可是它对待革命政府的态度却截然不同，因为革命政府把人民从垄断组织和大庄园主的压迫下解放了出来。
    卡斯特罗指出，这不是一个孤立的事件。进行这个罪恶破坏的就是这样一些人，从他们的领土起飞的飞机纵火焚烧古巴甘蔗田和轰炸古巴城市。卡斯特罗说，去年10月第一次轰炸哈瓦那的人仍然在美国的大街上自由自在地游逛。
    卡斯特罗谴责美国当权者向国会提出的食糖法是新的普拉特修正案（这是本世纪初美国国会通过的干涉古巴内政的著名法案——编注）。根据这个法律，美国总统可以随意改变美国市场上的食糖限额。企图以这种方式来对古巴革命实行经济报复。
    卡斯特罗提醒人们注意美国将在加勒比海进行的军事演习，这种演习的目的是以入侵来恐吓和威胁古巴人民。卡斯特罗说，“我们不怕任何侵略军。古巴人民中任何一个男子或妇女都一秒钟也不会迟疑地拿起枪杆，保卫祖国。”卡斯特罗说，他希望神智不清不会搅乱了侵略者的辨别力，但是，如果竟然不顾一切地侵略古巴，那么全国人民都将战斗到最后一滴血。古巴革命决不后退，而且将继续前进。
    据官方到目前为止的不完全统计，在这次爆炸中，三百三十三人受伤，七十二人死亡。
    据新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴全国各地今天根据古巴工人联合会的决定，举行了六小时到二十四小时的全国性罢工，追悼在4日反革命爆炸“勒库布尔号”事件中的死难者。所有的民兵都在举行全国性的哀悼示威和抗议。他们还在古巴工人联合会的大厦里守灵。全国今天都下半旗向死难者致哀。
    古巴工人联合会发表声明说，美帝国主义者和一切国际反动派都知道，古巴革命是拉丁美洲各国人民高举着的旗帜，于是他们就疯狂地反对它。但是，尽管他们进行侵略，他们却决不可能把革命镇压下去。敌人的每一次进攻都会使人民和工人阶级更加坚定地起来保卫革命。
    古巴大学生联合会、古巴妇女争取拉丁美洲解放大会、古巴革命妇女联盟、基层工会、农民协会、天主教团体、自由职业者团体和文化组织都提出谴责和向死难者致哀。
    据新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴“革命报”今天说，越来越完整的调查表明，是接受那些策动反古巴的国际阴谋的人指挥的犯罪分子制造了“勒库布尔号”爆炸的事件。“革命报”说，许多细节肯定了这个论断。
    这家报纸说，一个名叫当纳德·查普曼的二十六岁的美国人曾经乘过这只船，他自称是合众国际社的记者，是作为旅客乘船的。查普曼曾在船上拍摄照片。“革命报”指出，所有这些都表明，查普曼知道船上有武器，而且美国也知道这些武器是运给古巴的。查普曼已被古巴革命当局逮捕。
    “革命报”评论道，众所周知，美国曾经施加外交压力，使所有的国家都拒绝把武器卖给古巴。“革命报”指出，那些对古巴实行经济侵略，指挥从空中焚烧古巴甘蔗田，并使战犯为他们的野蛮目的效劳的人，不可能与昨天的谋杀没有关连。
