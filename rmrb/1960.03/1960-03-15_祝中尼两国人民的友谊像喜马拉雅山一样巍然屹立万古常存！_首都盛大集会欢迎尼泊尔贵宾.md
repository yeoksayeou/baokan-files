Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon to warmly welcome the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, and his wife, as well as the accompanying distinguished Nepalese guests. The people of the capital presented the Prime Minister with a banner at the rally, embroidered with golden characters: "May the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples stand tall like the Himalayas and last forever!"

Today, the national flags of China and Nepal were hung side by side on the central curtain of the rostrum of the Great Hall of the People, and the rostrum was surrounded by evergreen palms and blooming flowers. At 3 p.m., Prime Minister Koirala and his wife, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Mayor Peng Zhen and his wife, and Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, stepped onto the rostrum amidst welcoming music. At this moment, in the brilliantly lit auditorium, the crowd stood up and burst into thunderous applause, expressing a warm welcome to the distinguished Nepalese guests. Prime Minister Koirala raised his clasped hands and waved to the crowd.

Also seated on the rostrum were the accompanying distinguished Nepalese guests: Minister of Engineering and Transport Ganesh Man Singh, Minister of Home Affairs and Justice Surya Prasad Upadhyaya, Foreign Affairs Secretary Nara Pratap Thapa, Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry Vishwa Shankar Shukla, Major General Chetra Bikram Rana, Upper House Member Maniharsha Jyoti, and Prime Minister's Private Secretary Kumar Mani Acharya Dixit. A group of Young Pioneers ran onto the rostrum and presented flowers to all the distinguished guests.

Accompanying the distinguished guests on the rostrum were also Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Pan Zili, President of the China-Nepal Friendship Association Zhou Jianren, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC Liu Ren, Vice Mayors of Beijing Wan Li, Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Wang Kunlun, Le Songsheng, Vice Chairmen of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and heads of various people's organizations in Beijing.

Prime Minister Koirala spoke amidst warm applause. He said, "I am grateful for the welcome you have given to me and my entourage, which truly expresses your friendship and goodwill towards Nepal and the Nepalese people."

The Prime Minister said: "Since I arrived in China, I have visited several construction projects in Beijing. I am deeply impressed by your nationwide efforts to develop the country in such a short period of time; your dedication and determination to build the country are commendable. I wish you greater and faster achievements in your great construction cause."

The Prime Minister said: "Your ability to achieve historic unity in the world's most populous country is of great significance to Asian countries. I feel that the great upsurge of unity and nationalism in Asian countries is largely inspired by the great example of national unity in your country. This solid foundation of unity and nationalism in Asian countries, which have just been liberated from the clutches of imperialism and colonialism, is indeed a factor of great significance in contemporary history. I am convinced that anyone who now attempts to subdue or dominate these freedom-loving Asian people by force or any similar means will not only fail but will be utterly impossible."

The Prime Minister said: "New China is the product of the unity of the Chinese people. The unity of the Chinese people has brought the final eradication of colonialism from the land of Asia closer to possibility. The Asian people should learn from history that if peace among Asian countries is once again disrupted, the dark ages of Asia will reappear. Therefore, the wise course of action for Asia today is to maintain and strengthen the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the relations between all countries, large and small, in Asia."

The Prime Minister said: "Although Nepal is a small country, it has always been independent in history. Precisely because we love our independence and freedom, we value the great significance of unity and independence of Asian countries today. Although our country is small, we understand the meaning and importance of world peace and universal brotherhood; we are pleased to see that the Chinese government and the Chinese people also strictly abide by these great principles, and we firmly believe that these principles will promote world peace and the prosperity of all countries."

The Prime Minister's speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause.

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke at the beginning of the meeting, extending a warm welcome on behalf of the people of Beijing to Prime Minister Koirala and his wife, as well as the distinguished Nepalese guests. He asked the distinguished guests to convey the friendship and cordial greetings of the people of Beijing and the entire Chinese people to the citizens of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and to the entire Nepalese people.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that China and Nepal have always been friendly neighbors. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries and the use of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guiding principles of the relations between the two countries, China and Nepal have been living in harmony, and our traditional friendship has greatly developed on a new basis. The exchanges and contacts between the two countries have become increasingly frequent, and friendly cooperation has become increasingly close. We believe that Your Excellency's visit will surely write a new and important page in the history of Sino-Nepalese friendly relations. He said: "The Chinese people have always followed Nepal's progress with great interest and sincerely congratulate it on its further achievements. The Chinese people are willing to strengthen cooperation with the Nepalese people, learn from each other, help each other, and achieve common prosperity."

Mayor Peng Zhen said that the people of China and Nepal have always worked to ease international tensions and firmly advocate that Asian and African countries should coexist peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner based on the Five Principles. The Chinese people have always admired and supported Nepal's efforts in adhering to a policy of peace and neutrality and promoting the unity of Asian and African countries. Despite the fact that imperialist war forces are still trying their best to undermine the unity of Asian and African countries, especially the unity between China and its neighbors, their conspiracy is being seen through by more and more people.

Mayor Peng Zhen emphasized that the Chinese people and the people of other Asian and African countries share common experiences and common interests, and the friendship they have established and developed in the long-term common struggle cannot be destroyed by any force. The continuous development of friendly relations between China and Nepal is a good proof of this. The Chinese people are willing to continue to work hand in hand with the Nepalese people to make greater contributions to promoting Asian-African unity and safeguarding world peace.

Mayor Peng Zhen's speech was also warmly welcomed. After the speeches by Mayor Peng Zhen and Prime Minister Koirala, the band played the national anthems of Nepal and China respectively.

After the speeches, the magnificent auditorium resounded with joyful music once again. Mayor Peng Zhen presented a banner and gifts to Prime Minister Koirala on behalf of the people from all walks of life in the capital. When Prime Minister Koirala took over the banner representing the deep friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people from Mayor Peng Zhen, people once again burst into thunderous applause, congratulating the friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people on standing forever like the Himalayas, which runs through our two countries. Amidst the long-lasting applause, Prime Minister Koirala also waved frequently, repeatedly expressing his warm greetings to everyone.

After the welcoming rally, the guests and hosts enjoyed the wonderful performances of Chinese artists together. Starting from the grand chorus of more than 400 people "Please Stay, Guests from Afar", Chinese artists performed the beautiful "Peacock Dance", excerpts from the ballet "Swan Lake", Peking Opera "The Pearl Presented at Rainbow Bridge", etc. Young actors Shi Xiuyun and Guo Song respectively sang the Nepalese folk song "Kau Li" and an interlude from the Nepalese drama "Harriet Tara", which they learned from Nepalese artists during their visit to Nepal with the Chinese cultural delegation in 1957. Their performances today were warmly welcomed.

After the performance, Prime Minister Koirala and his wife, as well as other distinguished Nepalese guests, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Mayor Peng Zhen and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi, etc., went to the stage to meet the actors, and the Prime Minister also presented flower baskets to the actors, thanking them for their successful performances. At this time, the band played melodious music again, and warm applause echoed in the ten-thousand-person auditorium for a long time. (Attached picture)

    祝中尼两国人民的友谊像喜马拉雅山一样巍然屹立万古常存！
    首都盛大集会欢迎尼泊尔贵宾
    柯伊拉腊首相说：亚洲各国应该维护和加强和平共处五项原则，中国严格遵守着这些伟大的原则
    彭真市长说：中国人民愿同尼泊尔人民继续携手合作为促进亚非团结维护世界和平作出更大贡献
    新华社14日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午在人民大会堂举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎尼泊尔王国首相毕什韦什瓦·普拉萨德·柯伊拉腊和夫人以及随行的尼泊尔贵宾。首都各界人民在大会上献给首相的一面锦旗上绣着金色的大字：“祝中尼两国人民的传统友谊像喜马拉雅山一样巍然屹立，万古常存！”
    今天，人民大会堂主席台正中的帷幕上，并排高悬中国和尼泊尔两国国旗，主席台四周布满了长青棕榈和盛开的鲜花。三时，柯伊拉腊首相和夫人由周恩来总理、彭真市长和夫人、陈毅副总理和夫人陪同，在欢迎乐曲声中，步上主席台。这时候，在灯光辉煌的大会堂里，万众起立，发出暴风雨般的掌声，向尼泊尔贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。柯伊拉腊首相高举紧握的双手，向大家致意。
    在主席台上就座的，还有随同来访的尼泊尔贵宾：工程和交通大臣加奈什·曼·辛格，内政和司法大臣苏里亚·普拉萨德·乌帕德亚亚，外事秘书纳拉·普腊塔普·塔普，商业和工业部秘书维什瓦·山卡尔·舒克拉，少将切特拉·比克拉姆·拉纳，上院议员马尼哈尔沙·乔提，首相私人秘书库马尔·马尼·阿查里雅·迪克希特等。一群少年先锋队员跑上主席台，向全体贵宾献了鲜花。
    陪同贵宾们一起登上主席台的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫、中国驻尼泊尔大使潘自力，中国尼泊尔友好协会会长周建人，北京市政协主席刘仁，北京市副市长万里、冯基平、吴晗、王昆仑、乐松生，北京市政协副主席和北京市各人民团体的负责人等。
    柯伊拉腊首相在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，我很感激你们给予我和我的随行人员的这种欢迎，它确实表达了你们对尼泊尔和尼泊尔人民的友谊和善意。
    首相说：我到达中国以来，已经在北京参观了几个建设工程。你们举国一致在这样短的时期内所作的发展国家的努力，使我获得很深的印象；你们建设国家的献身精神和决心是值得称颂的。我祝你们在伟大的建设事业中获得更大、更快的成就。
    首相说：你们能够在世界上人口最多的国家中达到历史性的团结，这对亚洲各国有很重大的意义。我感到亚洲各国团结和民族主义的伟大高涨，在很大的程度上是在贵国全国团结的伟大榜样的鼓舞下形成的。刚刚从帝国主义和殖民主义魔爪中解放出来的亚洲各国的团结和民族主义的这种坚强基础，对于当代历史确实是一个意义巨大的因素。我深信，任何人现在企图用武力或者任何类似的手段来压服或者统治这些爱好自由的亚洲人民，不仅不能够成功，而且是根本不可能得逞的。
    首相说：新中国是中国人民团结的产物。中国人民的团结使殖民主义从亚洲土地上最后绝迹接近了可能。亚洲人民应该从历史中吸取教训，那就是如果亚洲各国间的和平再度遭到破坏，亚洲过去黑暗的时代就会再次出现。因此，亚洲今天明智的做法，就是在亚洲所有大小国家之间的关系中维护和加强和平共处五项原则。
    首相说：尼泊尔虽然是小国，它在历史上一直是独立的。正因为我们热爱自己的独立和自由，我们很重视今天亚洲各国团结和独立的伟大意义。我们的国土虽小，我们懂得世界和平和普遍的兄弟情谊的意义和重要性；我们高兴地看到，中国政府和中国人民也严格遵守着这些伟大的原则，我们深信这些原则会促进世界和平和各国的繁荣。
    首相的讲话，不时被春雷般的掌声所打断。
    彭真市长在大会开始的时候讲话，他代表北京市全体人民向柯伊拉腊首相和夫人以及尼泊尔的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。他请贵宾们把北京市人民和全中国人民的友情和亲切的问候带给尼泊尔首都加德满都的市民和全体尼泊尔人民。
    彭真市长说，中国和尼泊尔一向是友好的邻居。自从我们两国建立外交关系并且以和平共处五项原则作为两国关系的指导原则以来，中尼两国一直和睦相处，我们的传统友谊在新的基础上有了很大的发展，两国间的往来接触日益频繁，友好合作日益紧密。我们相信，首相阁下的访问一定会在中尼友好关系史上写下新的重要的一页。他说：中国人民一向以极大的兴趣注视着尼泊尔的进步，并且衷心地祝贺它获得进一步的成就。中国人民愿意同尼泊尔人民加强合作，互相学习，互相帮助，以达到共同繁荣的目的。
    彭真市长说，中尼两国人民都一贯为和缓国际紧张局势而努力，并且坚决主张亚非国家应该根据五项原则和平共处、友好合作。中国人民对于尼泊尔在坚持和平中立政策和促进亚非国家团结方面所作的努力，一向表示钦佩和支持。尽管帝国主义战争势力还在千方百计地力图破坏亚非国家的团结，特别是中国和它的邻国的团结。但是，它们的这种阴谋正在被越来越多的人所识破。
    彭真市长强调说，中国人民和其它亚非国家人民有着共同的遭遇和共同的利益，他们在长期的共同斗争中建立和发展起来的友谊是任何力量也破坏不了的。中尼两国友好关系的不断发展就是一个很好的证明。中国人民愿意同尼泊尔人民继续携手合作，为促进亚非团结和维护世界和平共同做出更大的贡献。
    彭真市长的讲话同样受到了热烈的欢迎。在彭真市长和柯伊拉腊首相讲话以后，乐队分别奏起尼泊尔和中国的国歌。
    讲话完毕，瑰丽的大会堂再一次响起欢乐的乐曲。彭真市长代表首都各界人民向柯伊拉腊首相献旗、献礼。当柯伊拉腊首相从彭真市长手里接过表示中尼两国人民深厚友谊的锦旗的时候，人们又一次发出春雷般的掌声，祝贺中尼两国人民的友谊像横贯在我们两国之间的喜马拉雅山一样永远屹立，万古长存。柯伊拉腊首相在经久不息的掌声中，也频频挥手，一再向大家热烈致意。
    欢迎大会结束后，宾主一起欣赏了中国艺术家们的精采表演。从四百多人的大合唱“远方客人请你留下来”开始，中国艺术家们表演了优美的“孔雀舞”、芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”片断，京剧“虹桥赠珠”等。年青的演员史秀云和郭颂分别演唱了尼泊尔民歌“卡乌利”和尼泊尔话剧“哈瑞特·塔拉”插曲，这是他们在1957年随中国文化代表团访问尼泊尔时向尼泊尔的艺术家们学习的。他们今天的演唱受到热烈的欢迎。
    演出结束以后，柯伊拉腊首相和夫人以及尼泊尔的其他贵宾，由周恩来总理、彭真市长和夫人、陈毅副总理等陪同，登上舞台同演员们会见，首相还向演员们赠送了花篮，感谢他们成功的演出。这时候，乐队又一次奏起悠扬的乐曲，热烈的掌声长时间地在万人礼堂里回旋。（附图片）
