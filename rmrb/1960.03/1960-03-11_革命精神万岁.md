Long Live the Revolutionary Spirit

The electric ramming machine is born! The ramming workers clapped and cheered with joy, saying that Huang Huating had done a great thing for them.

This is a heartfelt cheer from the workers. Think about it, someone who works all day with a five-jin hammer is now going to operate a machine. How could they not be overjoyed!

The workers' inner joy has a deeper meaning: the profound inspiration that Huang Huating's tenacious revolutionary spirit brings to people.

Our industrious and courageous people have long been revolutionizing against the reactionaries. Now, they are also revolutionizing against nature. Revolutionizing against nature, like revolutionizing against the reactionaries, requires a tenacious revolutionary spirit. With this spirit, we can be invincible. Look! Wasn't this electric ramming machine born after four years of struggle!

From the day Huang Huating aspired to build the machine, his entire mind was dominated by two emotions. One was: no matter how difficult it is to build an electric ramming machine, it must be built; the other: can a person who has only studied for seven months do it? After four years, after one hundred and three failures, finally, the machine was built! Victory! This is the victory of the tenacious revolutionary spirit. At a time when the tide of technical revolution is sweeping the country, in the face of the mighty mass movement, we want to raise our arms and shout:

Long live the revolutionary spirit!

    革命精神万岁
    电动夯墙机出世了！夯墙工人高兴得拍手叫好，连说，黄华庭为他们干了一件好事。
    这是工人们从内心深处发出来的欢呼声。想想看，一个整天拿着五斤多重的铁锤工作的人，现在要换上机器操作了，怎么能不乐得心花怒放呢！
    工人们内心的喜悦还有着更深的意义，这就是黄华庭那种顽强的革命精神给人们带来的深刻启示。
    我国勤劳勇敢的人民，曾经长期革过反动派的命。如今，他们又在革大自然的命了。革大自然的命，同革反动派的命一样，也要有顽强的革命精神。有了这种精神，就可以攻无不克。瞧！这台电动夯墙机不是经过四年斗争出世了吗！
    黄华庭从立志造机器的那天起，整个思想就在两种情绪支配下。一种是：不管电动夯墙机多么难造，都要把它造出来；另一种：一个只读过七个月书的人，能行吗？经过了四年，经过了一百零三次的失败，最后，机器造出来了！胜利了！这是顽强斗争的革命精神的胜利。在技术革命的波涛正在举国翻腾的时候，在浩浩荡荡的群众运动面前，我们要振臂高呼：
    革命精神万岁！
