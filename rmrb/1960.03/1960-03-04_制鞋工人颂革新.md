　　From ancient times, making shoes was done by hand,
　　With awls, hammers, and big knives at hand;
　　Tools were heavy, production was low,
　　Shoe-makers were bent over from head to toe.
　　Now we use simple, homemade machines,
　　Work becomes light and skillful it seems,
　　Cloth shoe production increases manyfold,
　　Thanks to the Party's good leadership, we are told.

    制鞋工人颂革新
    自古做鞋手工操，
    锥子鎯头和大刀；
    工具笨重产量少，
    上鞋工人累弯腰。
    如今使用土机器，
    干起活来轻又巧，
    布鞋增产好几倍，
    感谢党的好领导。
