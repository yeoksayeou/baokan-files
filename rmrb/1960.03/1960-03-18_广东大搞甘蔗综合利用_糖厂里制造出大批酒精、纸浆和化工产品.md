Guangdong Province, rich in sugarcane, is implementing the policy of "using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods" to vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane. Many sugar factories that originally produced single varieties and operated seasonally are now gradually transforming into sugarcane chemical factories producing multiple varieties and operating year-round, thereby greatly increasing the utilization value of sugarcane and creating more wealth for the country.

Currently, out of more than 100 sugar factories in Guangdong Province, 63 have already engaged in the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane. Among the more than 100 workshops that went into production before September of last year, 64 workshops use bagasse as raw material, and their main products include household paper, pulp, paperboard, furfural, activated carbon, white spirit, and alcohol. Thirty-nine workshops utilize molasses to produce alcohol, dry ice, and yeast. There are also two workshops utilizing filter mud, mainly producing sugarcane wax. Among these workshops, with the exception of Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory and others which are relatively large-scale modern workshops, the vast majority were established using indigenous methods or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods.

These workshops produced more than 12,700 tons of alcohol last year, accounting for about 90% of the province's alcohol production; more than 2,000 tons of pulp, 350 tons of paper, 750 tons of paperboard, 17 tons of furfural, and more than 19 tons of activated carbon, as well as sugarcane wax, dry ice, and other products. The large-scale alcohol workshop of Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory produces alcohol with a concentration of up to 96 proof; alcohol produced by indigenous methods also reached about 93 proof. The paper made entirely or partially from bagasse includes newsprint, glazed paper, and wrapping paper. Of the 15 types of paper currently produced in the province, more than half can be manufactured using bagasse. The quality of the chemical product furfural, used as a raw material for plastics, has an average aldehyde content of 97% (refined furfural).

As a result of implementing the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane, many sugar factories that were originally single-variety, seasonal producers have gradually transformed into multi-variety, year-round sugarcane chemical factories.

Guangdong Province's comprehensive utilization of sugarcane is being carried out by implementing the Party's policy of "walking on two legs." During the Great Leap Forward, based on the results of scientific research in the past few years and construction needs, the Party called on sugar factories to comprehensively utilize sugarcane. The state also invested in the construction of China's first modern Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory for the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane in Guangdong Province. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this work and decided to change the furnaces that originally used bagasse as fuel to coal-fired furnaces, so as to make full use of bagasse to produce products. Currently, the furnaces of seven large sugar factories with a daily crushing capacity of more than 1,000 tons of sugarcane, including Shunde, Zini, and Dongguan, have been completely or partially rebuilt. The workers of the sugar factories actively responded to the Party's call, giving full play to their spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and vigorously established comprehensive utilization workshops or factories. Yuwotou Sugar Factory, due to fully mobilizing the masses, making do with whatever was available, and solving equipment and materials problems themselves, realized the transformation from one factory into eight factories in less than a year, producing various products such as household paper, paperboard, alcohol, and colored liquor. Using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods to develop comprehensive utilization is not only fast, but also requires less investment and yields greater results. For example, the capital construction investment per ton of production capacity in the alcohol workshops established by Longpo and Changpo Sugar Factories using indigenous methods is only between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan, which is only one-fifth or one-twentieth of that of workshops using foreign methods. Dongguan Sugar Factory manufactured iron drying cylinders for use in paper machines, which not only had good quality but also enabled the paper machines to be put into production quickly.

While carrying out production, workshops or factories established using indigenous methods are also constantly accumulating experience, improving equipment, and improving technology, thereby continuously increasing the output and quality of products and continuously reducing costs. For example, the paper-making workshop of Zhongshan Sugar Factory, which produces 1.5 tons per day, has reached a daily output level of two tons due to improving workers' operational skills and improving power equipment, with a 42.85% reduction in cost and a 93.4% finished product rate.

### 广东大搞甘蔗综合利用  糖厂里制造出大批酒精、纸浆和化工产品

    广东大搞甘蔗综合利用
    糖厂里制造出大批酒精、纸浆和化工产品
    本报讯　盛产蔗糖的广东省，贯彻土法上马、土洋结合的方针，大搞甘蔗综合利用。许多原来生产单一品种和季节性生产的糖厂，现在逐步转变为多品种、常年生产的甘蔗化工厂，从而大大提高了甘蔗的使用价值，为国家创造了更多的财富。
    目前，在广东全省一百多个糖厂中，已经有六十三个厂进行甘蔗的综合利用。在去年9月前投入生产的一百多个车间中，用蔗渣做原料的车间有六十四个，主要产品有日用纸、纸浆、纸板、糠醛、活性炭、白酒、酒精等产品。有三十九个车间利用废蜜生产酒精、干冰、酵母等。还有两个利用滤泥的车间，主要生产蔗腊。在这些车间中，除江门甘蔗化工厂等是比较大型的现代化车间以外，绝大部分是用土法或洋土结合的办法搞起来的。
    这些车间去年一年生产酒精一万二千七百多吨，相当于全省酒精产量的90％左右；生产纸浆二千多吨、纸三百五十吨，纸板七百五十吨，糠醛十七吨，活性炭十九吨多，还有蔗腊、干冰等产品。江门甘蔗化工厂的大型酒精车间生产的酒精，浓度达到九十六度；用土法生产的酒精也达到了九十三度左右。全部或部分用蔗渣造出的纸有新闻纸、油光纸、包装纸等多种，在目前全省出产的十五种纸中，能够利用蔗渣制造的，已占了一半以上。作塑料原料的化工产品糠醛质量平均含醛量达97％（精醛）。
    实行甘蔗综合利用的结果，许多原来是单一品种、季节性生产的糖厂，已逐步转变为多品种、常年生产的甘蔗化工厂。
    广东省对甘蔗的综合利用，是贯彻党的两条腿走路的方针搞起来的。大跃进中，党根据过去几年来科学研究的成果和建设需要，向糖厂提出了综合利用甘蔗的号召。国家并投资在广东省兴建了我国第一个现代化的对甘蔗全面综合利用的江门甘蔗化工厂。中共广东省委十分重视这一工作，决定把原来以蔗渣作燃料的炉子改为烧煤炉，以便充分利用蔗渣制产品。现在已有顺德、紫坭、东莞等七个日榨甘蔗千吨以上的大糖厂的炉子全部或部分改建。糖厂的职工积极响应党的号召，发挥敢想敢干精神，大办综合利用车间或工厂。鱼窝头糖厂，由于充分发动群众，因陋就简，自己动手解决设备、材料，不到一年时间，便实现了一厂变八厂，制出了日用纸、纸板、酒精、色酒等多种产品。用土法上马、土洋结合办法搞综合利用，不仅速度快，而且投资少、收效大。如龙坡、长坡两个糖厂用土法上马建立的酒精车间，每吨生产能力的基建投资只在三千元到五千元之间，只有洋法生产车间的五分之一或二十分之一。东莞糖厂自己制造出抄纸机上使用铁烘缸，不仅质量良好，而且使抄纸机能迅速投入生产。
    由土法上马的车间或工厂，在进行生产的同时，也不断积累经验、改进设备、提高技术，从而使产品的产量、质量不断提高，成本不断降低。如中山糖厂日产一吨半的造纸车间，由于提高工人操作水平和改进了动力设备，日产水平已经达到两吨，成本降低了42．85％，成品率达到93．4％。
