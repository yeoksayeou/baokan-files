Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 13th: The House Foreign Affairs Committee recently released a lengthy speech by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, J. Wayne Fredericks, regarding the United States' policy of "aid" to Africa. In his speech, Fredericks vigorously advocated for the United States to control the direction of African countries' development and promote American neo-colonialism in Africa by strengthening economic, cultural, and military "aid."

Fredericks anxiously acknowledged that the wave of anti-colonialism "is sweeping across the African continent." He clamored for the "necessity to coordinate the surge of nationalism with an orderly transition from the past to the future." In other words, he believed that it was necessary to find ways to castrate the revolutionary fighting spirit of the African national independence movement so that it could be controlled and utilized by the United States.

He believes that the current U.S. "aid" program for Africa is "insufficient in scope or scale to accommodate the remarkable changes taking place," and demanded that $157.5 million be allocated for "aid" to Africa in the 1961 fiscal year.

However, Fredericks himself stated in his speech that U.S. "aid" is merely a tool of American neo-colonialism. For example, the three North African countries of Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia are the focus of U.S. "aid" for 1961. While emphasizing the importance of aid to these countries, Fredericks said, "The United States has special political and military interests in this region," and "It is also very important for the United States to maintain the right to use some important bases in Africa, and for the United States and its allies to continue to obtain a wide range of important materials, mainly minerals, in Africa." He openly admitted that U.S. "aid" to Africa is "to achieve these strategic and political goals (of the United States)."

Fredericks vigorously promoted cultural aggression through "education" and "training programs." In addition, the U.S. military aid to Africa for 1961 is planned to increase to $18.2 million, an increase of $5.1 million over the previous year. Fredericks said: "I believe that these modest programs are an important and sound investment for the defense of the United States and the security of the free world (referring to the capitalist world). ... It will help achieve our political goals."

### 用“援助”为推行新殖民主义开路  美国力图加强对非洲的控制

    用“援助”为推行新殖民主义开路
    美国力图加强对非洲的控制
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会众议院外交委员会最近发表了美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威特在这个委员会上发表的关于美国对非洲的“援助”的政策的长篇演说。萨脱斯威特在演说中大力鼓吹美国通过加强经济、文化和军事“援助”的办法，来控制非洲国家的发展方向，在非洲推行美国的新殖民主义。
    萨脱斯威特焦虑地承认，反对殖民主义的浪潮“正在席卷非洲大陆”。他叫喊什么“有必要把民族主义的高涨和有条不紊地从过去过渡到未来的方法加以协调”。换句话说，他认为必须设法阉割非洲民族独立运动的革命斗争精神，使它能为美国所控制利用。
    他认为，美国目前对非洲的“援助”计划，“在范围或规模方面都不足以适应所发生的引人注目的变化”，要求在1961财政年度拨出一亿五千七百五十万美元“援助”非洲。
    但是萨脱斯威特自己在演说中表明，美“援”只不过是美国新殖民主义的一种手段。例如，北非的利比亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯三国是1961年度美“援”的重点。萨脱斯威特在强调对这几个国家援助的重要性时说，“美国在这个地区有着特殊的政治和军事的利益”，“美国保持使用它在非洲的某些重要基地的权利，美国和它的盟国继续在非洲取得广泛的重要物资、主要是矿藏，这也是十分重要的”。他公开招认，美国对非洲的“援助”是“为了达到（美国）这些战略和政治目的”。
    萨脱斯威特极力鼓吹通过“教育”和“训练计划”进行文化侵略。此外，1961年度美国计划对非洲的军事援助增为一千八百二十万美元，比上一年度增加了五百一十万美元。萨脱斯威特说：“我相信，这些不算大的计划对于美国的防务和自由世界（指资本主义世界）的安全是一项重要的健全的投资。……将有助于达到我们的政治目标。”
