    A New Stage in the Women's Liberation Movement in China
    Today is the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. Women all over the world will warmly celebrate this great revolutionary and solidarity holiday. In the past fifty years, the world's working women's liberation movement has made great progress. Now, one-third of the world's women have been freed from class exploitation and class oppression. The women's liberation movement, whether in capitalist countries or colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries, has achieved significant accomplishments under the banner of the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. In our country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the women's movement has begun to embark on a new stage of realizing the complete liberation of women in the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement. The ideals of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the outstanding leader of the international women's movement, Clara Zetkin, regarding the realization of women's liberation, are inspiring more and more women around the world to join the ranks of the revolution.
    Marx's historical materialism tells us that since the emergence of class antagonism in human society, working women have always been the most cruelly and barbarously oppressed objects of all exploiting classes. The social root cause of the oppression of working women is the private ownership of the means of production. The oppression they suffer is essentially class oppression. Therefore, working women can only achieve true liberation by carrying out class struggle under the leadership of a Marxist party, eliminating class oppression, and abolishing the private ownership of the means of production. It is precisely because of this that Marxists have always believed that the women's liberation movement should not and cannot be carried out in isolation. It can only achieve victory when combined with the proletarian revolutionary movement. The women's liberation movement is a broad mass movement that includes women from all strata. This movement is part of the great social class struggle. Only the leadership of proletarian Marxism-Leninism can guide women onto the road of complete liberation. At the same time, working women are the most resolute revolutionary force among women. The women's movement must take working-class and peasant women as its main body, unite women from all strata, and carry the women's liberation movement through to the end. The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era of human liberation and also opened a new era of women's liberation. The people's democratic revolutions and socialist revolutions in eleven countries in Eastern Europe and Asia during and after World War II not only led these countries onto the bright road of socialist construction, but also led the women of these countries onto the bright road of complete liberation. At present, the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism is flourishing. The victory of this struggle is the decisive prerequisite for women's liberation. It is precisely because of this that working women in all countries have actively participated in this great struggle and made significant contributions. Facts have proven that there can be no talk of women's liberation without the revolutionary movement. The Marxist-Leninist theory on women's liberation is the only correct theory for women's liberation. The path of women's liberation in socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, is the only correct path for women's liberation in the world.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese working women, united with women from all strata, together with the people of the whole country, have experienced the great struggles of the new democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The victory of the new democratic revolution freed Chinese women from the class exploitation and class oppression of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, and, like men, made them masters of the country. The victory of the socialist revolution completely realized the socialist ownership of the means of production, and the roots of class exploitation and class oppression were finally eliminated. This has provided Chinese women with broad opportunities for activity in political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. However, after the victory of the socialist revolution, is the task of women's liberation considered complete? The Marxist-Leninist answer is: the task of women's liberation has not yet been completed, and there is much more important work to be done. Engels pointed out in "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State": "As long as women are excluded from socially productive labor and are restricted to private labor in the home, women's liberation, women's equality with men, is impossible. Women's liberation becomes possible only when women can participate in production on a large scale, on a social scale, and domestic work occupies only a small part of their time." Obviously, the victory of the socialist revolution is far from the end of the women's liberation movement. "Participation in production on a large scale, on a social scale" by women, this is the direction pointed out by Marx and Engels for the continued advancement of the women's liberation movement after the victory of the socialist revolution. Lenin said in "A Great Beginning": "Notwithstanding all the laws emancipating woman, she continues to be in fact a domestic slave, because petty housework crushes, strangles, stultifies and degrades her, chains her to the kitchen and the nursery, and she wastes her labour on barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery. The real emancipation of women, the real communism, will begin only where and when an all-out struggle begins (led by the proletariat wielding the state power) against this petty housekeeping, or rather when its wholesale transformation into a large-scale socialist economy begins." Lenin made it clear that whether or not to liberate women from domestic labor is a question of whether or not to have true women's liberation, a question of whether or not to have true communism. Communism requires people to have a high degree of political consciousness, advanced cultural and scientific knowledge, and production skills. It is inconceivable that humanity can enter communism when women are still bound by trivial and stultifying domestic labor. Therefore, how to treat the issue of women's participation in production and domestic labor is an extremely important principled issue for the complete liberation of women and the realization of communism. In socialist society, there can be two diametrically opposed attitudes towards the women's issue: one is to advocate that women return home to engage in domestic labor; the other is to advocate that women come out of the home, get rid of domestic labor, and participate in social production. The former is a wrong attitude, which is actually a reflection of bourgeois ideology and even feudal ideology. The latter is the correct Marxist-Leninist attitude.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in his editor's note to "Women Have Gone to the Labor Front" in "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "It is of extremely great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in productive activities in order to build a great socialist society." Our country's socialist construction cause needs women to participate in social production, and women also urgently demand to get rid of domestic labor and participate in social production. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party and government have consistently paid attention to mobilizing women to participate in social production. By 1957, the number of female workers nationwide reached 3,286,000, an increase of 447.7% compared with 1949; even more women in rural areas participated in agricultural production. However, for the vast number of women who are burdened by trivial domestic labor, regular participation in social production is still just a wish for them. This part of the women (including women in rural areas burdened by domestic labor and street women and workers' family members in cities) is still the majority of women nationwide. It was only after the start of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 that this situation underwent a drastic change. The Great Leap Forward required a large amount of female labor to participate in industrial and agricultural production. In the past two years, hundreds of millions of women, whether in rural or urban areas, have plunged into the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, promoting the tremendous development of production. Like men, the broad masses of women have become the basic force for continuous Great Leaps Forward. This is an unprecedented great change in the social outlook of our country, especially in the outlook of women. Following the large-scale participation of women in social production is a major change in women's lifestyles. The ownership of the means of production in our country is socialist in nature, and industrial and agricultural production is social and collective, and this mode of production inevitably requires a social lifestyle to adapt to it. With the participation of large numbers of rural women and urban street women and female family members of workers in production, the domestic labor problems of these women, mainly cooking and taking care of children, must be resolved. Solving the problem of domestic labor used to be an extremely difficult problem. However, the establishment of rural People's Communes and the development of urban street welfare services have provided the possibility for solving this problem and pointed out a far-reaching direction. The establishment of public canteens, nurseries, service stations, and other collective welfare services in People's Communes and urban streets has greatly reduced the burden of women's domestic labor, enabling them to free up time to participate in social production. The "participation in production on a large scale, on a social scale" by women, as Engels said seventy-six years ago, is beginning to become a reality in our country. The "real emancipation of women" that Lenin spoke of forty-one years ago has begun in our country. The great historical significance of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes is also reflected in the women's issue. Chinese women have finally found a concrete path for complete liberation from domestic labor and participation in social production. This is why it is said that the women's liberation movement in our country has entered a new historical stage.
    Today, Chinese women are a vital force in the great socialist construction cause. Together with the people of the whole country, they have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and are striving to realize the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960. By the end of 1959, the number of female workers had reached more than 8 million, an increase of more than 5 million compared with 1957; almost all women with labor ability in rural areas have participated in production. The 10,000 advanced women and collectives selected from women across the country this year on "March 8th" Women's Day are the banner of the more than 300 million women in our country, and also a sign of women's "participation in production on a social scale." These advanced women are leading the women around them to move forward together. The political and ideological awareness of women has been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm is soaring. According to statistics for the first half of 1959 alone, 540,000 female advanced producers emerged in state-owned factories and mines. The broad masses of rural women have changed from engaging in auxiliary labor to engaging in main labor. Field management of various crops, pig raising, and manure accumulation are mainly undertaken by women. Chinese women have become a main force on the agricultural labor front. Women in urban streets have also actively set up street industries. According to incomplete statistics from eleven large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Harbin in the autumn of 1959, women accounted for 76% of the total number of employees in street industries, with the most in Beijing, where women accounted for 95%. Women are the main force in street industries. They started from scratch and vigorously engaged in production, playing a significant role in promoting the development of urban local industries. On the cultural front, young women have had the opportunity to receive full education from primary school to middle school to university. Women who have participated in production mostly work hard to learn to read. Many of them, after getting rid of illiteracy, have entered half-day schools or spare-time primary schools, and some have entered spare-time middle schools and universities. With the continuous improvement of their political and cultural level, many women have become electrical administrators, tractor drivers, agricultural technicians, construction workers, drillers, train dispatchers, aviators, technicians, engineers, doctors, teachers, accountants, literary and sports workers, scientific workers, and Party and government cadres. In the past few years, the outlook of women has undergone great changes. They are no longer backward and narrow-minded housewives, but glorious socialist builders who are both red and diligent, skillful and thrifty.
    The central task of the current women's work is to further mobilize women to widely participate in social production. Women who have already participated in social production should actively carry out technological innovation and technological revolution on various fronts. We must emancipate our minds, break superstitions, be innovators in the cause of socialist construction, and bravely stand at the forefront of the mass movement of manual operation mechanization and semi-mechanization, so as to change the face of our country's production technology in all aspects and develop our country's productive forces at a high speed. Women who have labor ability but have not yet participated in social labor should be mobilized and strived for their conscious participation in the labor front. Countless experiences in various places have proved that the broad masses of women have a very urgent desire to participate in social labor. Many places are satisfying the reasonable demands put forward by women for social transformation and progress as well as their own transformation and progress in many ways. This is completely correct. In order to adapt to the Great Leap Forward in production and the needs of the broad masses of women to participate in social labor, it is necessary to further realize the socialization of domestic labor and vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings. Transform scattered, trivial, and stultifying domestic labor into collective large-scale socialist economic undertakings. In rural and urban areas across the country, 50 million children have entered nurseries and kindergartens. Many excellent childcare workers have excellently acted as mothers, allowing mothers to participate in production with peace of mind. Hundreds of millions of men, women, old, and young across the country eat collectively in canteens. Many excellent cooks try their best to make everyone eat their fill and eat well, and run the meals to everyone's satisfaction. Lenin called public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens as communist shoots in "A Great Beginning." He said: "These specimen shoots are nothing remarkable, plain, ordinary things, but actually they are capable of liberating women, of lessening and eliminating their inequality with men as regards their role in social production and social life." Our country's revolutionary practice has fully proved this truth. With the continuous improvement of production, social service undertakings have undergone new developments. Many urban streets have established service stations. When female workers leave home to participate in production, the trivial housework left behind, such as fetching water, buying daily necessities, and washing and mending clothes, is undertaken by the service stations. Women in these places can no longer worry about housework. From then on, it can be hoped that in the near future, about 200 million young and middle-aged women will all participate in social labor. Comrade Mao Zedong's call in 1955 to "make all female labor force... participate in the labor front without exception" will be realized in not a long time. This is of extremely important significance not only to women, but also to the country's construction cause. On the basis of participating in social labor and socializing domestic labor, the broad masses of women must continuously strive to improve their political theory and cultural and scientific knowledge level, must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and cultivate themselves into laborers who are selfless for the public, helpful to others, love the collective, have a high degree of communist ideological awareness and a high degree of cultural and scientific knowledge.
    On the occasion of commemorating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, we would like to extend our warm congratulations to the advanced women and all women comrades on various fronts. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of our great Party and the leader of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chinese women, holding high the three red banners, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, together with the people of the whole country, will surely be able to complete the great tasks of the new stage of socialist construction in our country.

### 我国妇女解放运动的新阶段

    我国妇女解放运动的新阶段
    今天是“三八”国际劳动妇女节的五十周年。全世界的妇女，都将热烈地纪念这一伟大的革命的节日和团结的节日。在过去的五十年中，世界劳动妇女的解放运动有了巨大的发展。现在，全世界三分之一的妇女已经摆脱了阶级剥削和阶级压迫，妇女解放运动，无论在资本主义各国或殖民地、半殖民地、附属国，在为和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义而斗争的旗帜下，取得了重大的成就。在我国，妇女运动在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社运动中，开始走上实现妇女彻底解放的新阶段。马克思、恩格斯、列宁以及国际妇女运动的卓越的领导人克拉拉·蔡特金关于实现妇女解放的理想，正在鼓舞着全世界越来越多的妇女参加革命的行列。
    马克思的历史唯物论告诉我们：人类社会出现阶级对立以来，劳动妇女从来就是一切剥削阶级的最残酷、最野蛮的压迫对象。劳动妇女受压迫的社会根源是生产资料的私有制。她们所受的压迫本质上是阶级的压迫。因此，劳动妇女只有在马克思主义的政党的领导下进行阶级斗争，消灭阶级压迫，废除生产资料私有制，才能够实现真正的解放。也正因为是这样，马克思主义者从来就认为，妇女解放运动不应该也不可能孤立地进行，它只能同无产阶级革命运动结合在一起才能取得胜利。妇女解放运动，是包括各阶层妇女的广泛的群众运动，这个运动是伟大的社会阶级斗争的一部分。只有无产阶级的马克思列宁主义的领导才能引导妇女走上彻底解放的道路。同时，劳动妇女是妇女中最坚决的革命力量。妇女运动必须以工农劳动妇女为主体，团结各阶层的妇女，才能把妇女解放运动进行到底。伟大的十月社会主义革命，开创了人类解放的新纪元，也开创了妇女解放的新纪元。第二次世界大战中和战后东欧和亚洲十一个国家的人民民主革命和社会主义革命，不仅使这些国家走上社会主义建设的光明大道，而且也使这些国家的妇女走上彻底解放的光明大道。目前，世界各国人民为和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争，正在蓬勃开展。这个斗争的胜利，是妇女解放的决定性的前提。正因为这样，各国劳动妇女积极地参加了这个伟大的斗争，并且作了重大的贡献。事实证明，离开革命运动，就谈不到妇女解放。马克思列宁主义关于妇女解放的理论，是妇女解放的唯一正确的理论。以苏联为首的社会主义国家妇女解放的道路，是世界妇女解放的唯一正确的道路。
    中国劳动妇女在中国共产党的领导下，团结各阶层妇女，同全国人民一起，经历了新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的伟大斗争。新民主主义革命的胜利，使中国妇女摆脱了帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的阶级剥削和阶级压迫，同男子一样，成为国家的主人。社会主义革命的胜利，完全实现了生产资料的社会主义所有制，阶级剥削和阶级压迫的根源被最后消除了。这就为中国妇女提供了在政治、经济、文化、社会和家庭生活中宽广的活动机会。但是，在社会主义革命胜利以后，妇女解放任务是不是就算完成了呢？马克思列宁主义的答复是：妇女解放任务尚未完成，还有许多更重要的工作要做。恩格斯在“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”一书中指出：“只要妇女被摒弃在社会的生产劳动以外而只限于家中私人劳动，那末妇女的解放，妇女跟男子的平等，便是不可能的。妇女的解放，只有在妇女可以大量地、社会规模地参加生产，而家庭工作仅占有她们很少工夫的时候，才有可能。”显然，社会主义革命的胜利，远不是妇女解放运动的终结。妇女“大量地、社会规模地参加生产”，这是马克思、恩格斯指出的社会主义革命胜利以后妇女解放运动继续前进的方向。列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中说过：“尽管颁布了种种解放妇女的法律，但妇女仍然是家庭奴隶，因为琐碎的家庭事务压迫她们，窒息她们，使她们愚钝卑贱，把她们缠在做饭管小孩的事情上；极端非生产性的、琐碎的、劳神的、使人愚钝的、折磨人的工作占去了她们的时间。只有在反对这种琐碎家务的普遍斗争（为掌握国家权力的无产阶级所领导的）开始了的地方，更确切地说，只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”列宁说得明白，要不要把妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，是要不要真正的妇女解放的问题，是要不要真正的共产主义的问题。共产主义要求人们有高度的政治觉悟、高等的文化科学知识和生产技能。不能设想，当着妇女还束缚在繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动上的时候，人类可以进入共产主义。因此，如何对待妇女参加生产和家务劳动的问题，是妇女彻底解放和实现共产主义的一个极其重要的原则问题。在社会主义社会中，在妇女问题上可以有两种截然相反的态度：一种是主张妇女回到家里去，从事家务劳动；一种是主张妇女从家里出来，摆脱家务劳动，参加社会生产。前者是错误的态度，实际上是资产阶级思想以至封建思想的反映。后者才是正确的马克思列宁主义的态度。
    毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中“妇女走上了劳动战线”一文的按语中说：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。”我国的社会主义建设事业需要妇女参加社会生产，而妇女也迫切地要求摆脱家务劳动，参加社会生产。中华人民共和国成立以来，我们党和政府一贯地注意发动妇女参加社会生产。到1957年，全国女职工达三百二十八万六千人，比1949年增加447．7％；农村中参加农业生产的妇女就更多。但是，对于那些受繁琐的家务劳动牵累的广大妇女来说，经常地参加社会生产还只是她们的一种愿望。这一部分的妇女（包括农村中的有家务劳动牵累的妇女和城市中的街道妇女以及职工家属），还是全国妇女的大多数。仅仅是在1958年大跃进开始以后，这种情况才发生急剧的变化。大跃进要求大量的妇女劳动力参加工农业生产。两年来，无论在农村或城市，上亿的妇女投身大跃进的行列，促进了生产的巨大发展。广大妇女同男子一样，成为连续大跃进的基本力量。这是我国社会面貌、特别是妇女面貌前所未有的大变化。紧接着大批妇女参加社会生产之后发生的是妇女生活方式的大变化。我国生产资料的所有制是社会主义性质的，而工农业生产又是社会性的和集体性的，这种生产方式必然要求社会的生活方式与之相适应。随着大批农村妇女和城市街道妇女以及职工家属妇女参加生产，这些妇女的家务劳动问题，主要是做饭、带孩子等，必需加以解决。解决家务劳动问题，这在过去曾经是极其困难的问题。但是，农村人民公社的建立和城市街道福利事业的兴办，为这个问题的解决提供了可能并且指出了远大的方向。人民公社和城市街道的公共食堂、托儿所、服务站等集体福利事业的兴办，大大减轻了妇女家务劳动的负担，使她们能够腾出时间来参加社会生产。七十六年前恩格斯所说的妇女“大量地、社会规模地参加生产”，在我国开始成为现实。四十一年前列宁所说的“真正的妇女解放”，在我国开始了。大跃进和人民公社的伟大历史意义，也表现在妇女问题上。我国妇女终于找到了摆脱家务劳动、参加社会生产的彻底解放的具体道路。这就是为什么说，我国妇女解放运动进入一个新的历史阶段。
    今天，我国妇女是伟大的社会主义建设事业的生力军。她们同全国人民一道，已经提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，并正在为实现1960年国民经济的继续跃进而努力。到1959年底，女职工已达八百多万人，比1957年增加了五百多万人；农村中几乎所有有劳动能力的妇女都参加了生产。今年“三八”妇女节从全国妇女中选拔出的一万名先进妇女和集体，是我国三亿多妇女的旗帜，也是妇女“社会规模地参加生产”的标志。这些先进妇女，带动周围妇女一起前进。妇女的政治思想觉悟大大提高，干劲冲天。仅据1959年上半年统计，国营厂矿出现女先进生产者五十四万人。广大农村妇女已经由从事辅助劳动变成从事主要劳动。各种作物的田间管理、养猪、积肥等劳动，主要由妇女担任。中国妇女已经成为农业劳动战线上的一支主力军。城市街道的妇女也积极地举办起街道工业，据北京、天津、哈尔滨等十一个大中城市1959年秋季的不完全的统计，妇女在街道工业中占全体职工人数的76％，最多的如北京市，妇女占到95％。妇女是街道工业的主力，她们白手起家，大搞生产，对促进城市地方工业的发展起了重大的作用。在文化战线上，青年妇女有了从小学到中学到大学受充分教育的机会。参加了生产的妇女，大都努力学习识字，其中许多人在摆脱文盲状态后，又进入半日制学校或业余小学，有一部分已进入业余中学和大学。随着政治文化水平的不断提高，许多妇女成了电气管理员、拖拉机手、农业技术员、建筑工人、钻探工、列车调度员、航空员、技术员、工程师、医生、教师、会计、文艺和体育工作者、科学工作者和党政工作干部。几年来，妇女的面貌起了很大的变化。她们不再是落后的、狭隘的家庭妇女，而是又红又勤又巧又俭的光荣的社会主义建设者了。
    当前妇女工作的中心任务是进一步发动妇女广泛地参加社会生产。已经参加社会生产的妇女要积极地在各个战线上大搞技术革新和技术革命。一定要解放思想，破除迷信，作社会主义建设事业的革新者，勇敢地站在手工操作机械化、半机械化群众运动的前列，从各方面来改变我们国家的生产技术的面貌，高速度地发展我国的生产力。凡是有劳动力而目前还没有参加社会劳动的妇女，应当动员和争取她们自觉地参加到劳动战线上来。各地无数的经验证明，广大妇女对于参加社会劳动是有着十分迫切的要求的。许多地方正在多方面地满足妇女们为着社会的改造和进步以及自身的改造和进步所提出的合理的要求。这是完全正确的。为了适应生产大跃进和广大妇女参加社会劳动的需要，要进一步实现家务劳动的社会化，大力办好集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业。把分散的、繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造为集体的大规模的社会主义经济事业。在全国农村和城市，已有五千万儿童进入托儿所、幼儿园。许多优秀的保教人员，出色地代理了妈妈的职务，使妈妈安心参加生产。全国已有数以亿计的男女老幼在食堂集体吃饭，许多优秀的炊事员，想尽办法使大家吃得饱、吃得好，把伙食办得人人满意。列宁在“伟大的创举”中曾把公共食堂，托儿所和幼儿园称作是共产主义的幼芽。他说：“这些幼芽的标本是没有什么了不起的、平凡的、普通的东西，这些东西实际能够解放妇女，减少和消除她们在社会生产和社会生活上同男子的不平等。”我国的革命实践完全证明了这个真理。随着生产的不断提高，社会服务事业又有了新的发展，许多城市的街道成立了服务站，女职工离开家庭参加生产的时候，留下来的琐碎家务如打开水、买日用品、拆洗衣被，都由服务站负担了起来。这些地方的妇女已经可以不再为家务事操心了。从此可以希望，在不久的将来，两亿左右的青壮年妇女将会全部参加社会劳动。毛泽东同志1955年提出的“使全部妇女劳动力……一律参加到劳动战线上去”的号召，不需要很长时间将得到实现。这不仅是对妇女，而且也是对国家建设事业有着极重要的意义。在参加社会劳动和家务劳动社会化的基础上，广大妇女要不断努力提高自己的政治理论和文化科学知识水平，要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，培养自己成为舍己为公、助人为乐、热爱集体的有着高度共产主义的思想觉悟和高度文化科学知识的劳动者。
    在纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节的时候，我们谨向在各个战线上的先进妇女和全体妇女同志们致以热烈的祝贺。我们深信，我国妇女在我们伟大的党和各族人民领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，同全国人民一起，一定能够完成我国社会主义建设新阶段的伟大任务。
