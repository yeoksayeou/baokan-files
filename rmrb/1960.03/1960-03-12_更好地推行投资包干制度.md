    Better Promote the Investment Contract System

    The basic construction investment contract system is an important system for promoting the high-speed development of basic construction and is a product of the Great Leap Forward and the mass movement in the national economy. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, a surging mass movement emerged on the basic construction front. It was at this time that the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, under the leadership of the Party, mobilized the broad masses and created the basic construction investment contract system. As soon as this method appeared, it immediately received enthusiastic support from relevant leading organs and was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, and began to be promoted nationwide. In July 1958, the State Council issued the "Several Provisions on Improving the Financial Management System for Basic Construction," which systematically summarized this experience, stipulating that, under the conditions of ensuring that production capacity is not reduced, the completion date is not postponed, and the total investment is not exceeded, the basic construction investment determined by the national plan and the national budget should be handed over to the construction unit for independent arrangement and contracted use. In May 1959, the State Council further summarized the experience of various localities in implementing the investment contract system and issued supplementary regulations on the basic construction investment contract system, further clarifying that the implementation of the investment contract must obey planned management, ensure project quality, and strengthen financial management. In this way, the investment contract system became more perfect.

    Over the past year, the success of various localities in promoting the basic construction investment contract system has powerfully demonstrated that this is a good form for adjusting the relations of production in basic construction, developing communist cooperation, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. The investment contract system has already demonstrated its strong vitality and superiority in many ways.

    The investment contract method mobilizes the enthusiasm of all parties involved in basic construction and embodies the principle of "unified leadership, decentralized management," thus making the relations of production more adaptable to the needs of high-speed development of the productive forces. With the implementation of the investment contract system, as long as the requirements of the state plan are guaranteed and the investment contract regulations are followed, the construction unit can modify design quotas, adjust construction projects, and adjust the use of funds; the funds saved, with the approval of higher authorities, can be used to expand the scale of construction, and the more saved, the larger the scale of construction can be. This will better unleash the tremendous potential that objectively exists in basic construction and promote the faster, better, and more economical development of basic construction.

    Investment contracts promote the development of mass movements in basic construction work. In order to achieve contract targets, all departments and units must launch mass movements on a large scale, widely mobilize the masses, and tap potential from all aspects such as planning, design, construction, and finance. Because the construction plan, design plan, and construction plan are explained to the masses at all levels, and the contract indicators are determined at all levels, the masses have clear goals to strive for, which makes it easier to let go and mobilize the masses to actively think of ways, offer suggestions, make detailed accounts, and tap potential, and it is possible to tighten non-productive expenditures, reduce the cost standards of secondary projects, rationally arrange specific projects, and modify unreasonable architectural designs, so that plans can be more advanced and investment can be allocated more rationally. In this way, more human, material, and financial resources can be tapped and used to expand the scale of construction and increase production capacity. Because the investment contract system is implemented, with explanations at each level and indicators contracted to production teams, it is easier to mobilize the masses to participate in management and accounting during the construction process, and to carry out mass economic accounting movements on a large scale, and to closely combine it with labor competitions, technical innovations, and technical revolution movements. Through accounting analysis, the masses know their labor results and discover advanced pacesetters, which makes it easier to launch labor competition movements to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward, and also promotes the development of mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The result of this is that not only greatly reduces construction costs, but also speeds up the progress of the project and improves the quality of the project, turning the policy of building more, faster, better, and more economically into the conscious action of the broad masses. Workers say: "After the contract, we have responsibility on our shoulders, power in our hands, a clear understanding in our minds, and energy all over our bodies."

    The investment contract management system also promotes communist cooperation among construction units, construction enterprises, design departments, and construction banks. Experience has proved that after the implementation of the investment contract management system, the goals of construction units, construction enterprises, design departments, and construction banks are all unified on the common construction task, trusting each other, supporting each other, and promoting each other. Construction units create conditions for smooth construction everywhere; construction enterprises carefully calculate everywhere, "loving the factory as their home"; design departments go deep into the site to improve the design; construction banks guarantee the supply of funds and support production and construction. A large-scale communist collaboration became a trend.

    Precisely because the investment contract method adjusts the relations of production in basic construction, mobilizes the enthusiasm of all parties, and facilitates the launch of mass movements and the strengthening of collaboration, it has powerfully promoted the high-speed development of the construction industry and achieved very significant economic results. For example, the thirteen construction units directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry originally planned to invest 490 million yuan, with a production capacity of 15.51 million tons of coal per year, and a total construction period of 451 months; after the implementation of the investment contract system from the second half of 1958, only 336 million yuan of investment was needed, the production capacity could be increased to 21.92 million tons, and the total construction period only needed 252 months. Compared with the past, the investment was saved by 31%, the production capacity was increased by 41%, and the construction period was shortened by an average of fifteen months. Facts have proved that the implementation of the investment contract system can achieve significant results in expanding the scale of construction, accelerating the speed of construction, improving the quality of construction, and reducing costs.

    Perhaps some people will ask, after the implementation of the investment contract system, allowing construction units to use the funds saved to expand the scale of construction, will this impact the national plan? In the process of mobilizing the masses to modify the design and save building materials, will this affect the quality of the project? Practice has proved that as long as the Party's leadership is strengthened and political and ideological work is done well, this situation will not occur. First of all, the implementation of the investment contract system, according to the regulations of the State Council, is carried out under the premise of guaranteeing the national plan. Judging from the situation of various localities in promoting the investment contract system, the general practice is to mobilize the masses, discuss contract tasks, tap potential, and find tricks, so that the national plan is more complete and the national plan is transformed into the actual actions of the masses. The construction unit has completed the national plan through efforts and has saved funds and materials, which is precisely the result of mobilizing the masses, tapping potential, and actively balancing. As for using the funds saved to expand the scale, according to the regulations of the State Council, it still needs to be approved by the leadership department, so that the balance of the planning department, the balance of the masses, and the re-balance of the leadership department at each level are combined, which will not only not affect the balance of the national plan, but also make it easier to mobilize the masses to ensure the completion of the national plan. Secondly, mobilizing the masses to modify the design is carried out under the leadership of the Party, using the method of combining the construction unit, the construction enterprise, and the design department, and combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians, which will only tap more potential and make the design more reasonable and more in line with reality, and will not reduce the quality of the project. Many construction units have achieved a first-class product rate of 90%-99% after the implementation of the investment contract system, basically eliminating third-class products, and the quality of the project has been greatly improved, which is proof.

    China's basic construction plan for 1960 is a grand plan for continued leap forward. The basic construction front has won the first battle this year and achieved a good start. Under this excellent situation, we should rely closely on the leadership of the Party, continue to actively promote the investment contract system, and closely combine the mass movement of promoting the investment contract system with the increase production and practice economy movement centered on "high speed, high quality, economy, collaboration, and safety" on the basic construction front. It must be clearly recognized that the active purpose of promoting the investment contract system is to launch mass movements on a large scale in basic construction work, to carry out communist collaboration on a large scale, and to promote the high-speed development of basic construction. We believe that as long as we launch mass movements on a large scale, carry out communist collaboration on a large scale, and do a good job in investment contracting, we will definitely be able to promote the better and more comprehensive leap forward of basic construction work in 1960.

    更好地推行投资包干制度
    基本建设投资包干办法，是促进基本建设高速度发展的一项重要制度，是国民经济大跃进和大搞群众运动的产物。1958年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，基本建设战线上出现了汹涌澎湃的群众运动。就在这个时候，北京石景山钢铁公司在党的领导下，发动了广大群众，创造了基本建设投资包干办法。这个办法一出现，立即得到有关领导机关的热情支持，受到了广大职工的热烈欢迎，并且开始在全国范围内推广。1958年7月，国务院颁发了“关于改进基本建设财务管理制度的几项规定”，把这个经验作了系统的总结，在保证不降低生产能力、不推迟交工日期、不突破投资总额的条件下，把国家计划和国家预算确定的基本建设投资，交给建设单位自行安排，包干使用。1959年5月，国务院又进一步总结了各地推行投资包干办法的经验，颁发了基本建设投资包干办法的补充规定，进一步明确了实行投资包干必须服从计划管理，保证工程质量，加强财务管理工作。这样，投资包干办法就更趋完善了。
    一年多来，各地推行基本建设投资包干办法的成功，有力地证明了这是一个调整基本建设中生产关系、发展共产主义协作、大搞群众运动的良好形式。投资包干办法已经在多方面显示出它的强大的生命力和优越性。
    投资包干的办法调动了基本建设各有关方面的积极性，体现了“统一领导、分级管理”的原则，这样就使生产关系更加适应生产力高速度发展的需要。实行投资包干办法，只要保证完成国家计划的要求和执行投资包干的几项规定，建设单位可以修改设计定额、调整建设项目、调剂资金使用；节约下来的资金，经过上级批准，可以用来扩大建设规模，节约得越多，就能够把建设规模搞得越大。这样就能把基本建设中客观存在着的巨大的潜力，更好地发挥出来，促进基本建设的多快好省地向前发展。
    投资包干促进了基本建设工作中群众运动的发展。各部门，各单位为了实现包干指标，必须大搞群众运动，广泛地发动群众，从计划、设计、施工、财务等各个环节上来挖掘潜力。由于把建设计划、设计方案和施工方案，层层向群众交底，层层确定包干的指标，群众有了明确的奋斗目标，因而就便于放手发动群众，积极地想办法、出主意、算细账、挖潜力，也就有可能紧缩非生产性开支、降低次要工程的造价标准、合理安排具体项目、修改不合理的建筑设计，使计划订得更先进，投资分配得更合理。这样，就能挖掘更多的人力、物力和财力，用来扩大建设规模，增加生产能力。由于实行投资包干办法，层层交底，指标包到生产小组，这样就便于在施工过程中，发动群众参加管理、参加核算，大搞群众性的经济核算运动，并把它同劳动竞赛、技术革新和技术革命运动密切结合起来。通过核算分析，群众知道了自己的劳动成果，发现了先进的标兵，就便于掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的劳动竞赛运动，同时也促进了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，这样做的结果，不但大大降低了建设成本，而且加快了工程进度，提高了工程质量，把多快好省的建设方针，变为广大群众的自觉行动。工人们说：包干以后“肩上有责，手中有权，心里有底，浑身是劲”。
    投资包干管理制度还促进建设单位、建筑企业、设计部门和建设银行的共产主义协作。经验证明，实行投资包干的管理制度以后，建设单位、建筑企业、设计部门、建设银行的奋斗目标，都统一到共同的建设任务上面，互相信任，互相支援，互相促进。建设单位处处为顺利施工创造条件；建筑企业处处精打细算，“爱厂如家”；设计部门深入现场改进设计；建设银行保证资金供应，支援生产建设。大搞共产主义协作成了风气。
    正由于投资包干办法调整了基本建设中的生产关系，调动了各方面的积极性，便于大搞群众运动，加强协作，因而有力地促进了建设事业的高速度发展，获得了十分显著的经济效果。例如：煤炭工业部直属的十三个建设单位，原来计划投资为四亿九千万元，生产能力为年产煤一千五百五十一万吨，建设总工期为四百五十一个月；从1958年下半年实行投资包干办法后，只要投资三亿三千六百万元，生产能力可以提高到二千一百九十二万吨，建设总工期只要二百五十二个月。与以前比较，投资节约31％，生产能力提高41％，工期平均提前十五个月。事实证明实行投资包干办法，能够取得扩大建设规模、加快建设速度、提高工程质量、降低成本的显著效果。
    也许有人会问，实行投资包干办法以后，允许建设单位用节约下来的资金，扩大建设规模，这样做会不会冲击国家计划呢？在发动群众修改设计，节约建筑材料的过程中，会不会影响工程质量呢？实践证明，只要加强党的领导，做好政治思想工作，这种情况是不会发生的。首先，实行投资包干办法，根据国务院的规定，是在保证国家计划的前提下进行的。从各地推行投资包干办法的情况来看，一般的做法都是发动群众，讨论包干任务，挖潜力，找窍门，这样就使国家计划更加完备，使国家计划变为群众实际行动。建设单位经过努力，完成了国家计划，又节省了资金和材料，正是发动群众，挖掘潜力，积极平衡的结果。至于用节省下来的资金扩大规模，按照国务院的规定，还需要经过领导部门的批准，这样就把计划部门的平衡、群众的平衡、同领导部门的逐级再平衡结合了起来，不但不会影响国家计划的平衡，而且更加便于发动群众来保证国家计划的完成。其次，发动群众修改设计是在党的领导下，采用建设单位、建筑企业、设计部门三结合，领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法进行的，这只会挖掘出更多的潜力，把设计修得更加合理，更加切合实际，而不会降低工程的质量。许多建设单位实行投资包干以后，一级品达到90％—99％，基本上消灭了三级品，工程质量大大提高，就是证明。
    我国1960年的基本建设计划，是一个继续跃进的宏伟计划。今年基本建设战线上首战告捷，实现了开门红。在这个大好形势下，我们应当紧紧依靠党的领导，继续积极推行投资包干办法，把推行投资包干的群众运动和基本建设战线上以“高速、优质、节约、协作、安全”为中心的增产节约运动紧密地结合起来。必须明确认识，推行投资包干办法的积极目的，就是要在基本建设工作中，大搞群众运动，大搞共产主义协作，促进基本建设高速度的发展。我们相信，只要大搞群众运动，大搞共产主义协作，把投资包干的工作作好，我们就一定能够促进1960年的基本建设工作更好、更全面的跃进。
