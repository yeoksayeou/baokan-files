    Collective Living is Good
    We, the residents of the family dormitory building of the Palace Museum, used to cook separately, each family for themselves. Many women spent their entire day by the stove, and the children roamed the streets with little supervision. Recently, under the leadership of the Xinjiekou Street Party Committee and the Palace Museum Party Committee, our building has established a collective canteen, a nursery, and a service station. More than 90% of the female labor force (a total of thirty-two people) have joined the workforce. The employees reflect, "Collective living is good."
    Take the night we established the canteen, for example! More than thirty of us women transported bricks and built stoves together. We had never been so united before. Li Xiangde, a young and strong woman from our building, used to be idle and uninterested in meetings and studies. This time, she actively participated in the canteen's cooking work, vying to do the heavy lifting. She said, "The collective canteen has stirred up my socialist enthusiasm."
    In addition, our building has also established a nursery and a service station. We have formed a medicine packaging workshop to package medicine for pharmaceutical factories. Qian Yuzhen, a family member, used to spend her days looking after her children and rarely went out. Since she participated in medicine packaging, her thinking has improved, and her production has increased. She now exceeds her quota every day and has become a production expert in the factory.

    集体生活就是好
    我们故宫博物院家属宿舍大楼里的居民，过去都是一家一户的做饭，许多妇女整天在炉台旁边转，小孩子满街乱闹，很少有人管。最近，我们大楼在新街口街道党委和故宫博物院党委的领导下，办起了集体食堂、托儿所和服务站，90％以上的妇女劳动力（共三十二人）都参加了工作。职工们反映：“集体生活就是好。”
    拿建立食堂的那一夜来说吧！我们三十多个妇女一块运砖头、建炉灶，过去大伙从来没有这样齐心过。大楼的李相德，是个年轻力壮的妇女，以前她闲着不干活，开会学习也没兴趣。这次，她积极参加了食堂的炊事工作，争着干重活，她说：“集体食堂把我的社会主义干劲鼓起来了”。
    另外我们大楼还成立了托儿所，服务站。组成了包药车间，为制药厂包药。家属钱玉珍以前成天忙着抱孩子，很少出门。自从她参加包药后，思想进步，生产提高，天天超额完成指标，成为全厂的生产能手。
