    Changes in Yanji City
    Li Gequan
    At dusk, I stood on the small hill of the West Suburb Park in Yanji City, the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, looking out. In the height of summer, this city of mountains and rivers appears particularly beautiful and graceful! The continuous mountain ranges embrace the entire city, and the Buerhatong River flows through the city and westward. Korean women wearing short jackets and long skirts wash their clothes on the white stones on the riverbank, accompanied by the gurgling sound of the flowing water. The streets are lined with green trees, reaching high into the blue sky. People come and go on the asphalt roads, which are very lively. Countless tall buildings shine with dazzling brilliance in the setting sun. Yanbian University, Yanbian Medical College, Yanbian Hospital, Yanbian Art School, and so on, have all been built in recent years. These magnificent buildings add splendor to the city.
    The municipal appearance of Yanji is changing day by day, but the most fundamental and profound change is that it is transitioning from a consumer city to a production city. Yanbian's famous machinery factory, electrical machinery factory, farm tool factory, tractor repair and assembly plant, knitting factory, etc., are all located here. Across the Yanji Bridge—in Henan, which was a vacant lot before liberation—tall buildings are now connected in a continuous stretch, becoming a thriving industrial zone. A large-scale iron and steel plant is also under construction here. The ranks of workers in Yanji City are growing stronger day by day, and now workers account for more than 20% of the entire city's population. Ten years ago, only a few scattered pedestrians walked across the Yanji Bridge, but now most of those who walk across here early in the morning and late in the evening are workers carrying lunch boxes. A comrade engaged in urban construction said that Yanji City will continue to expand, and Henan and Hebei will be connected together, and will also extend to Chaoyangchuan, a transportation hub leading to Helong, Kaishantun, and Jilin.
    It is said that Yanji has a history of about one hundred years, but its truly vital history began after liberation. One hundred years ago, the Korean people came here and opened up this place together with the fraternal ethnic groups here. From that time on, households gathered here. Day after day, year after year, slowly it became a small town, becoming the commercial center of this area. In autumn and winter, farmers from all around would use cattle and horses to carry their agricultural and sideline products here for exchange. At that time, there was only one street running east-west, two or three hundred households, a distillery, and a few cart inns. At that time, people called this place "a beautiful city of mountains and rivers." But in 1931, Japanese imperialism forcibly occupied this place and established the puppet "Jiandao" provincial capital here. Thus, this place became a criminal den for slaughtering, suppressing, and ruling the people of all ethnic groups in Yanbian. Once, the water of the Buerhatong River was dyed red! But the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture stood up even more courageously. The workers in the city laid down their hammers and went to the mountains. The farmers on the outskirts of the city put down their hoes and went to the mountains. The people who stayed in the city continued to carry out heroic struggles. A Korean woman, in order to protect a underground worker comrade, stood up and fought the enemy face to face. The enemy wanted to kill her, but she said, "I let the underground worker comrade go, I sent him back to the mountains! They will come back to kill you! They will come back to smash your devil's lair!" She fell, but more people rose up. The unyielding Korean people, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, advanced wave upon wave, fighting heroically, and finally defeated Japanese imperialism and defended this sacred land. And now, they have established their own ethnic autonomous government here, using their own hands to build this city that has suffered all the hardships of the world.
    With激动heart, I walked down the slope to an orchard. The orchard was full of pear trees. Fist-sized pears were covered with branches, exuding a fragrant aroma. I stopped in front of an apple-pear tree. This pear tree was short and sturdy, but every branch was covered with heavy fruit, the pears were big and yellow. The pears did not seem to be growing on the branches, but seemed to be piled up along the trunk. I asked a middle-aged woman who was watching the orchard, "How much does this tree bear?" The middle-aged woman said with a smile, "Three hundred catties!" "Three hundred catties?" I couldn't help but be taken aback. Apple-pears are a specialty of Yanbian, large, juicy, and easy to store, and are famous at home and abroad.
    I strolled slowly to the beautiful park area. Here, colorful flowers are in full bloom, and thick trees soar into the sky, their leaves crisscrossing. I remember that six or seven years ago, this place was still a weedy grassland, but now it has become a beautiful park.
    I walked out of the park, crossed a small bridge, and stepped onto the tall river embankment that stretched eastward along the Buerhatong River. Below the embankment, the transparent river water flowed gently over the bluestone. The crimson sunset glow shone on the water, and golden-red waves rippled on the surface. As the sky darkened, the riverbank became quiet, and the gurgling sound of the flowing water became even more pleasant. That sound seemed to be singing about the great changes that have taken place here, and seemed to be whispering to people, as if to say: Happy people, move forward!

    延吉市的变迁
    李根全
    黄昏，我站在延边朝鲜族自治州首府延吉市西郊公园的小山上了望。盛夏，这山水之城显得格外清秀、美丽！绵绵山岭环抱着整个城市，布尔哈通河，穿过城中，向西流去。穿着小袄长裙的朝鲜族妇女，在河岸的白石上，伴着淙淙的流水声，洗濯着衣衫。市街两旁绿树成荫，高接蓝空。柏油马路上，人来人往，非常热闹。无数座高楼大厦，在夕阳下闪耀着耀眼的光辉。延边大学，延边医学院、延边医院、延边艺术学校等等，都是近几年来建筑起来的。这些宏伟的建筑物，给城市增添了光彩。
    延吉的市政面貌一天天变化，但最根本最深刻的变化，是它正由一个消费城市向一个生产城市过渡。延边著名的机械厂、电机厂、农具厂、拖拉机修配厂、针织厂等都在这里。延吉桥的那边——河南，解放前是一片空地，现在这里高大的建筑物连成了一片，成了繁荣的工业区。一个规模较大的炼铁厂也正在这里兴建。延吉市的工人队伍，一天天成长壮大起来，现在全市的工人占整个城市人口的20％以上。十年前，在延吉桥上走过的只是一些零零落落的行人，现在一早一晚从这里走过的绝大部分都是挟着饭盒的工人了。我们一位搞城市建设的同志说，延吉市还要继续扩大，河南河北，要联结在一起，还要向通往和龙、开山屯、吉林方面去的交通要塞朝阳川伸展。
    据说，延吉这城市有一百年左右的历史，但它真正的富有生命的历史，是从解放后开始的。一百年前，朝鲜族人民来到这里，同这里的各兄弟民族一道开辟了这块地方。从那时起，人户就在这里集聚起来。一天又一天，一年又一年，慢慢这里成了小小的城镇，成了这一带的商业中心。一到秋冬，四处农民，就用牛马驮着他们的农副产品到这里来交换。那时，这里只是东西一条街，二三百户人家，有一个造酒局，几家大车店。那时人们称这里为“秀丽的山水之城”。可是1931年，日本帝国主义强占了这块地方，在这里建立了伪“间岛”省会。于是这里就成了屠杀、镇压和统治延边各族人民的罪恶的巢穴。有一次，布尔哈通河的河水都被染红了！但是州内的各族人民也更勇敢地站起来了。城里的工人撂下锤子上山去了。城郊的农民放下锄头上山去了。留在城里的人们继续进行英勇的斗争。有一位朝鲜族妇女，为了掩护一个地下工作同志，挺身出来同敌人面对面的斗争。敌人要杀她，但她却说：“地下工作同志我放走了，我放回山上去了！他们会回来杀死你们的！会回来捣碎你们这鬼穴的！”她倒下了，但是更多的人们起来了。不屈的朝鲜族人民，同州内的各族人民一道，前仆后继，英勇斗争，终于战胜了日本帝国主义，保卫了这块圣洁的土地。而现在，他们又在这里成立了自己民族的自治政府，用自己的双手建设着这个曾经受尽人间苦难的城市。
    我怀着激动的心情，顺坡走到一个果树园里。这果树园长满了梨树。拳头般大小的梨子，结满枝头，散发着扑鼻的香味。我在一棵苹果梨树前站住了。这棵梨树墩实矮小，但是条条枝条结满累累的果实，梨子又大又黄。那梨似乎不是长在树枝上，好像顺着树干堆起来似的。我问看园的一个中年妇女：“这棵树结有多少？”那中年妇女含笑说：“三百斤！”“三百斤？”我不禁吃了一惊。苹果梨是延边的特产，个大、汁多、又容易贮藏，在国内外都享有盛名。
    我又慢步走到了美丽的公园区内。这里盛开着五颜六色的鲜花，粗大的树木直冲半空，树叶纵横交错。我记得六、七年前，这里还是杂草丛生的草地，而现在却成了美丽的公园了。
    我走出公园，过了一座小桥，迈上了沿着布尔哈通河向东伸展开去的高大的河堤。河堤下面，透明的河水，在青石上轻轻的流去。绯红的晚霞，映照在水面上，水面荡起一片金红色的浪波。天色暗下来，河岸清静了，淙淙的流水声，更加悦耳动听。那声音仿佛在歌唱这里发生的伟大变化，又仿佛对人们窃窃私语，似乎在说：幸福的人们，前进吧！
