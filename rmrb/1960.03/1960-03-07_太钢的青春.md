    The Youth of Taiyuan Iron and Steel
    By our reporters Guo Jie, Fan Yinhuai

    Just after the urgent bell rang, molten iron poured out like a red waterfall as the electric drill was pulled out. The newly built large blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company tapped its first iron.

            Rebirth of an Old Factory

    Large blast furnace, what an attractive phrase!
    As early as 1934, the ancient city of Taiyuan had seen Yan Xishan start preparations for building the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. However, it took a full eight years, piecing things together, to build a blast furnace that looked like an ink bottle. Later, the Japanese invaders, in order to plunder our country's resources, also built blast furnaces here, but in the eight years before and after, they only added another "ink bottle" next to the blast furnace built by Yan Xishan. At that time, the total volume of these two blast furnaces was only forty cubic meters, and the daily output of pig iron was only fifteen or sixteen tons. Taiyuan, which was known as the "iron and steel center within the passes," was originally so pitiful. After liberation, the steelworkers, who became masters of the country, not only renovated the two "ink bottles" of Taiyuan Iron and Steel, but also built a large blast furnace, a modern power station, and a large coke oven here in just one year. Ascending to the top of the newly built large blast furnace and looking down at the original two small blast furnaces, they looked as small as a pile of earthen mounds. The birth of this blast furnace doubled the pig iron production of Taiyuan Iron and Steel from then on.
    It is not enough to simply say that the newly built large blast furnace is just a little bigger. It is not only large, but all the equipment is automated and modernized. Wang Qingyun, the shift foreman, introduced the technical achievements of the large blast furnace to the visitors with a radiant face. He is an old furnace worker of more than ten years, a person who used to deal with iron bars and large iron hammers. Now, standing in front of this huge and complex blast furnace, he only needs to press a button, and the electric drill and the electric mud gun will automatically open the iron tapping hole, and automatically block the hole again. Every time Wang Qingyun introduced the situation to people, he always said, "Now, Taiyuan Iron and Steel is in its youth."

    Collaboration Generates High Speed

    Who would have thought that it would take just over a year to build such a blast furnace? Speaking of speed, the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel still miss their brothers from Baotou Steel, Wuhan Steel, and Shijiazhuang Steel. The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel are excellent, but when the construction of this large blast furnace started, they couldn't help but feel nervous. Because building such a large blast furnace was their first time. It was at that time that Wuhan Steel, Baotou Steel, and Shijiazhuang Steel first extended their hands of friendship and sent more than 500 technicians and workers. As soon as they entered the construction site, they proposed: to build Taiyuan Iron and Steel like building Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel, and to build it faster and better than in the past.
    The task of bricklaying the blast furnace was very arduous, requiring more than 400,000 firebricks to be laid in less than a month, and only a gap the thickness of a hair was allowed between each brick. In order to seize time and ensure quality, the bricklayers launched a heated competition. The Nie Chengqi team from Wuhan Steel, which was responsible for bricklaying, was a famous model team; and the bricklaying team led by Gao Hanfu was not inferior, he was the first youth shock brigade of Baotou Steel. These two teams were evenly matched. Originally, the Gao Hanfu team from Baotou Steel could lay 1,100 bricks a day, while the Nie Chengqi team from Wuhan Steel only laid 900 bricks; but the Nie Chengqi team was not willing to lag behind, and launched a technical competition performance within the team, carried out technical innovations, and immediately increased to 1,500 bricks, surpassing the speed of the Gao Hanfu team. The two teams chased each other and helped each other, and finally both exceeded 2,500 bricks, which was several times higher than the original bricklaying efficiency of Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel.
    The workers from various brother factories dedicated their creative labor to the construction project of Taiyuan Iron and Steel. Those achievements will be engraved on the towering blast furnace and passed down.

      Difficulties Give Way to Heroes

    "Take on difficulties!" "We must make difficulties give way!" These are the bold words of the workers who built the large blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel. In those days of racing against time to ensure quality, unexpected difficulties blocked the workers' progress one after another. Not only were people not overwhelmed, but they also grew up one by one.
    The bricklaying project of the blast furnace body was about to end, and the installation project of the furnace top equipment was about to begin, but the entire company did not yet have a crane that could lift the furnace top equipment. Ensuring the completion of the installation project as scheduled became a major key to the timely commissioning of the blast furnace. For this matter, Geng Liantang, the foreman in charge of installing the furnace top equipment, ran up and down the blast furnace all day like an ant on a hot pot, thinking and pondering. Finally, he discovered that there was a small track on the top of the blast furnace leading to the furnace mouth. If a small car was installed on the track, and pulleys and steel cables were attached below, and the winch was used to pull the ropes, the small car could move on the track and lift the components to the top of the furnace. Geng Liantang's plan was quickly accepted by the leaders. Zhu Wenbin, the branch secretary, immediately assigned engineer Jin Qingchun and several others to research and manufacture it. The workers were also unambiguous when they heard that they were making a small car for installing the furnace top equipment. After a day of hard work, the small car was finally made. A test run was conducted that night, and a 25-ton cooling plate was lifted from the ground to the top of the furnace, 55 meters above the ground, in just a few tens of minutes, and it was very stable. The engineers and technicians who participated in the test run gave it a satisfactory appraisal. As a result, the installation of all the furnace top equipment was completed in just seven days.

    太钢的青春
    本报记者　郭洁　范银怀
    急促的钟声刚过，铁水像一股红色的瀑布，随着拔出的电钻倾泻出来。太原钢铁公司新建的大型高炉出铁了。
            老厂新生
    大型高炉，是多么吸引人的字眼！
    古老的太原，早在1934年，阎锡山就在这里动手筹建太原钢铁厂了。但是，整整用了八年时间，经过东拼西凑，才搞了一座像墨水瓶样的高炉。此后，日寇为了掠夺我国资源，在这里也搞过高炉，前后八年，也只是在阎锡山修的高炉旁边，加了一个“墨水瓶”。当时，这两座高炉，总容积不过四十立方米，生铁日产量只有十五、六吨。号称“关内钢铁重镇”的太原，原来就是这么可怜。解放了，当了国家主人的钢铁工人，他们不仅把太钢的两个“墨水瓶”改建得焕然一新，而且仅仅用了一年的时间，在这里又建设起了大型高炉，建起了近代化的电站和大型焦炉。登上新建大型高炉的炉顶，俯视原来的那两个小高炉，它们小得像一堆土丘。这座高炉的诞生，使太钢的生铁产量从此翻了一番。
    把新建的大型高炉简单地说成是大一点，那太不够了。它不仅是大，而且设备全部是自动化、现代化的。值班工长王庆云满面生辉地给参观的人们介绍着大型高炉的技术成就。他是十多年的老炉前工，一个成年和铁钎子、大铁锤打惯了交道的人。现在，他站在这个庞大而又复杂的高炉面前，只要按一下电钮，电钻和电动的堵泥炮就自动把出铁口捅开，又自动地把口子堵上了。王庆云每次向人们介绍过情况以后，他总要说一句：“现在，太钢才是青春时期”。
    协作产生高速度
    谁能想到，建设这样一座高炉仅仅用了一年多一点的时间呢。提起速度来，太钢工人至今还怀念着包钢、武钢和石钢的兄弟们。太钢的工人是好样的，但是当这座大型高炉破土动工的时候，却不能不感到紧张。因为建设这样一座大型高炉，对他们来说还是第一次。正是那个时候，武钢、包钢和石钢首先伸出了友谊的手，派来了五百多名技术工人。他们一进入工地就提出：要像建设武钢、包钢一样来建设太钢，并且要比过去建设得更快、更好。
    高炉的砌筑任务非常艰巨，要求在不到一个月的时间内砌完四十多万块耐火砖，而且每块砖之间只允许有一根头发丝的空隙。为了夺取时间，保证质量，砌炉工人们展开了一场热烈的竞赛。担负筑炉的武钢聂成棋小队，是有名的标兵队；而高汗富领导的筑炉队，也并不逊色，他是包钢第一青年突击队。这两个队遇到一起，真是棋逢对手。原先包钢高汗富队一天能砌一千一百块砖，武钢聂成棋队只砌九百块；但是聂成棋队不甘落后，在队内展开了技术比武表演赛，大搞技术革新，一下提高到一千五百块，赶过了高汗富队的速度。两队你追我赶、相互帮助，最后都超过了两千五百块，比武钢、包钢原来的砌砖效率提高了好几倍。
    来自各兄弟厂的工人们，把创造性的劳动献给了太钢的建设工程。那些功绩将刻在巍峨的高炉上流传下去。
      困难为英雄让路
    “见困难就上！”“一定要困难让路！”这是建设太钢大型高炉职工们的豪言壮语。在争夺时间保证质量的那些日子里，料想不到的困难曾经一个接着一个地拦住了工人们前进的道路。人们不仅没有被难倒，而且是一个个成长起来了。
    高炉本体的砌筑工程眼看就要结束，炉顶设备的安装工程就要开始了，但是整个公司眼前还没有能把炉顶设备吊上去的起重机。保证安装工程的如期完工，就成了高炉按时投入生产的一大关键。为这事，担负炉顶设备安装的工长耿连堂，整天像热锅上的蚂蚁在高炉上跑上跑下，琢磨着、思考着。最后，他发现在高炉炉顶有一个通到炉口的小道轨，如果在轨道上安装一辆小车，下面拴上滑轮和钢丝绳，用卷扬机牵动绳索，小车在轨道上移动，不就可以把部件吊到炉顶了吗。耿连堂的打算，很快被领导接受了。支部书记朱文彬当场就责成金庆春工程师等几个人研究和制作。工人们听说是为安装炉顶设备做小车，也毫不含糊。奋战一天，小车终于做出来了。当晚就进行了试车，二十五吨重的冷却板从地上吊到了离地五十五米高的炉顶，仅用了几十分钟，而且很稳当。参加试车的工程师和技术员给它做了满意的鉴定。结果，仅仅用了七天时间，全部炉顶设备的安装就完工了。
