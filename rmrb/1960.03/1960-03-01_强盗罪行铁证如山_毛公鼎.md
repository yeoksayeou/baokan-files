Ironclad Evidence of Robbery

Mao Gong Ding

The Mao Gong Ding is a well-known bronze artifact. Legend has it that it was unearthed in Qishan County, Shaanxi Province, during the late Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. It was initially acquired by Chen Jieqi of Weixian County, Shandong. The Ding contains an inscription of thirty-two lines, totaling four hundred and ninety-seven characters. It is the bronze Ding with the most inscriptions among those handed down through generations. The inscription's general meaning is a record of the Zhou King's command to Mao Gong? (Mao Gong is a conferred title, ? is the name of the owner who cast the Ding): The Zhou King ordered Mao Gong? to inherit the cause of his ancestors to assist the royal family, and rewarded him with food, drink, clothing, carriages, horses, weapons, ceremonial guards, etc. Looking at the inscription's phrases and wording, it is very similar in tone to the "Wen Hou's Command" article in the oldest extant classic, the "Shangshu." Comrade Guo Moruo, based on the Ding's shape and patterns, determined that it was a work from the time of King Xuan of Zhou (approximately 827-782 BC). It is a standard bronze artifact from the late Western Zhou Dynasty. This Ding fell into the hands of the national thief Yuan Shikai in the late Qing Dynasty, and later belonged to the Nanjing Museum (formerly the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum before liberation). The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique looted it from the Nanjing Museum to Taiwan.

   强盗罪行铁证如山
    毛公鼎
    毛公鼎是大家都知道的一件青铜器，传说是在清道光末年陕西岐山县出土，开始是由山东潍县陈介祺收买得来。这鼎里面有铭文三十二行，共四百九十七字。它是传世青铜器鼎中铭文最多的一件。铭文大意是周王策命毛公?（毛公是封的爵位，?是铸鼎的主人名字）的记事：周王叫毛公?继承他先人的事业来辅助王室，并赏给他酒食、衣服、车马、兵器、仪仗等等。看铭文的语句文辞，和传世最古的典籍“尚书”里的“文侯之命”一篇文辞的语气有极相像的地方。郭沫若同志从这鼎的器形花纹上参证，断定它是周宣王时（约当公元前827—782年）的作品。这是西周末期标准的青铜器。这鼎在清末曾落入窃国大盗袁世凯之手，后归南京博物院（即解放前的中央博物院筹备处），蒋介石卖国集团是由南京博物院劫掠去台湾的。
