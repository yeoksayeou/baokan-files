Xinhua News Agency, 20th. At the oath-taking and skills competition conference held by the national coal mine system in Beijing on the 19th, representatives of employees from seventy-nine units proposed to coal mine workers across the country to continue to deepen the red flag competition for large-scale and high-yield production.

Of these seventy-nine units, five are provincial-level administrations (bureaus), twenty-four are centrally-managed mining bureaus and mines, twenty-four are locally-managed coal mines, three are coal washing plants, eight are basic construction bureaus, seven are geological bureaus, and six are design institutes. The vast majority of them were winners in the 1959 national coal industry large-scale high-yield red flag competition. In their proposal, they unanimously stated that, in order to further change the technical landscape of coal mine production and construction and overfulfill the state plan, they suggest that all coal mine workers further establish high ambitions and lofty aspirations, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and climb the peak of coal production and construction. The joint proposal from employees of twelve mines, including Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine and Fushun Laohutai Mine, which won the National Red Flag Award for Large-Scale High-Yield Production for three consecutive seasons in 1959, proposed that in 1960, the average monthly output of their coal mining faces will reach 10,000 tons, 20,000 tons, and 25,000 tons respectively (calculated according to coal seam thickness), overfulfilling the 1960 competition assessment indicators for large-scale high-yield production recently revised by the Ministry of Coal Industry; the timber consumption rate will be reduced by more than 50% compared to 1959, the efficiency of all employees will be increased by 50% to 80%; and the cost of raw coal will be reduced by 20% compared to 1959. The employees of six coal mine basic construction bureaus, including Heilongjiang and Hebei, proposed in a joint proposal that in 1960, the construction period of the large, medium, and small-sized mines they construct will not exceed 800 days, 500 days, and 400 days respectively, shortening the mine construction period by 13%, 17%, and 5% respectively compared to 1959; construction costs should be reduced by 8% to 16% compared to 1959. Employees of seven coalfield geological bureaus, including Liaoning and Anhui, proposed in a proposal that in addition to ensuring that the monthly footage of each drilling rig will be increased by 30% compared to 1959, they also require that the quality of exploration will all meet national standards, reduce drilling costs by 15% to 20%, and strive to complete the annual tasks of reserves, drilling, surveying, and testing two to three months ahead of schedule.

In their proposals, employees from various units also put forward many practical and feasible measures. Employees of twelve mining bureaus, including Jingxi, Jiaozuo, and Pingdingshan, plan to further carry out various forms of red flag competition activities this year, such as counterpart competitions, key competitions, and pace-setter selection competitions, and to comprehensively promote the 180 major advanced experiences summarized by the coal industry last year, reform coal mining methods, and comprehensively improve the level of enterprise management at the fastest speed. Employees of three coal washing plants, Shuangyashan, Didao, and Nanshan, decided to focus on production links such as coal slime treatment, manual selection, sampling and sample preparation, and loading and unloading, to carry out technical innovation on a large scale, quickly achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization, and to adopt advanced technologies such as horizontal wind valves in large quantities, so as to improve the processing capacity of coal washing machines.

At the meeting, representatives of employees from four hundred and seventeen units responded to the proposal of these seventy-nine units, and they submitted letters of determination and challenge to the Ministry of Coal Industry, setting off a new production upsurge and seizing high yields in large areas of the coal industry.

    七十多个煤矿单位倡议
    开展大面积高产竞赛
    新华社20日讯　全国煤矿系统19日在北京举行誓师比武大会上，有七十九个单位的职工代表向全国煤矿职工提出了继续深入开展大面积高产红旗竞赛的倡议。
    这七十九个单位中，有五个是省一级管理局（厅），二十四个中央管理的矿务局和矿，二十四个地方管理的煤矿，三个洗煤厂，八个基本建设局，七个地质局，六个设计院。他们绝大部分是1959年全国煤炭工业大面积高产红旗竞赛中的优胜单位。他们在倡议书中一致表示，为了进一步改变煤矿生产建设的技术面貌和超额完成国家计划，建议全体煤矿职工进一步树雄心、立大志，大力开展技术革新和技术革命运动，攀登煤炭生产建设的高峰。1959年连续三季获得全国大面积高额丰产红旗奖的开滦唐家庄矿、抚顺老虎台矿等十二个矿的职工的联合倡议书中提出，1960年他们将做到采煤工作面的平均月产量分别达到一万吨、二万吨和二万五千吨（按煤层厚薄计算），超额完成煤炭工业部最近修订的1960年大面积高额丰产的竞赛评比指标；坑木消耗率比1959年降低50％以上，全员效率提高50％到80％；原煤成本比1959年降低20％。黑龙江、河北等六个煤矿基本建设局的职工在联合倡议中提出，1960年他们建设的大中小型矿井，工期将不超过八百天、五百天和四百天，比1959年的建井工期分别缩短13％、17％和5％；建筑成本要比1959年降低8％到16％。辽宁、安徽等七个煤田地质局职工在倡议中除了保证钻机每台月进尺将比1959年提高30％以外，并要求勘探质量将全部达到国家标准，降低钻探成本15％到20％，争取提前二个到三个月全面完成全年储量、钻探、测量、化验等任务。
    各单位职工在倡议中还提出了许多切实可行的措施。京西、焦作、平顶山等十二个矿务局职工计划今年要进一步开展对口赛、关键赛、标兵选拔赛等多种形式的红旗竞赛运动，用最快的速度全面推广煤炭工业在去年总结的一百八十项重大先进经验，改革采煤方法，同时要全面提高企业管理水平。双鸭山、滴道、南山三个洗煤厂职工决定将以煤泥处理、手选、采样制样、装卸车等生产环节为重点，大搞技术革新，迅速实现机械化和半机械化操作，并且将大量采用装置卧式风阀等先进技术，以便提高洗煤机的处理能力。
    会上，有四百一十七个单位的职工代表响应了这七十九个单位的倡议，他们纷纷向煤炭工业部提交了决心书、应战书，掀起一个新的生产高潮，夺取煤炭工业大面积高产。
