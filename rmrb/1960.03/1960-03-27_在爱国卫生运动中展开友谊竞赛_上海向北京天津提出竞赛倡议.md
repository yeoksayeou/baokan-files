Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee held its 15th meeting on the 25th, discussing and adopting the main points of the plan for the spring patriotic health campaign to vigorously promote hygiene and eliminate the four pests. It also adopted a proposal to launch a friendship competition in the patriotic health campaign with Beijing and Tianjin, outlining the following competition goals:

	(1) Vigorously eliminate the four pests (rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes) and snails. Resolutely and strictly control and treat breeding grounds. Everyone should wield fly swatters and other pest control tools, eliminating pests whenever and wherever they are found, and constantly maintaining a pest-free environment.

	(2) Vigorously eliminate the four diseases. Identify and fundamentally cure all patients with schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, and malaria. Ensure everyone understands prevention methods and prevents new infections. Combining technical innovation and technological revolution in production departments, further improve production conditions and the sanitary environment, actively prevent occupational diseases, actively prevent and control intestinal infectious diseases, and popularize preventive knowledge, ensuring early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment.

	(3) Do a good job in the hygiene of collective life. Public canteens and the catering industry should disinfect utensils, ensure fresh and hygienic food, and prevent collective food poisoning. Nurseries and kindergartens should establish sound hygiene systems, cultivate good hygiene habits in children, ensure good health, and prevent infectious diseases. Train childcare workers, cooks, and catering industry staff on a large scale, ensuring everyone masters relevant professional hygiene knowledge.

	(4) Vigorously promote environmental sanitation, fully implement a street-cleaning system, maintain cleanliness and tidiness everywhere, strengthen the management of粪便 and garbage, promote mud-sealed composting, manage toilets and latrines well to ensure harmless disposal of 粪便, and improve the hygiene of poultry and livestock sheds, keeping them harmless, odorless, and livestock healthy.

	(5) Popularize and improve the public's health knowledge and strengthen and develop mass health organizations. Strive to develop the city's contingent of mass health backbone and activists to one million people, ensuring that resident groups, workshop sections, production teams, and institutions, schools, shops, and companies have mass health organizations.

	(6) Vigorously and deeply carry out publicity and education on hygiene work. It is required that in the vigorous health publicity campaign, every household, men, women, old and young, understand the important significance of carrying out the health movement, all units and families establish health covenants, everyone diligently cleans, bathes, and washes clothes, does not spit or defecate anywhere, washes hands before meals and after using the toilet, and "takes hygiene as an honor and unhygienic behavior as a disgrace," making hygiene habits and beneficial physical activities a necessity of everyone's life and a new social fashion.

	(7) In the health movement, the city's medical and health workers should, under the leadership of the Party, raise their political and ideological awareness, invigorate their spirits, closely connect with the masses, learn the working methods of the mass line, take the lead, strive to be the first, play a backbone role, and demonstrate their abilities.

	(8) In order to realize the task of eliminating pests and diseases ahead of schedule, organize four large-scale shock campaigns to encircle and annihilate the four pests and vigorously promote hygiene this year, while establishing a regular hygiene system and carrying out mass movements for competition and emulation.
