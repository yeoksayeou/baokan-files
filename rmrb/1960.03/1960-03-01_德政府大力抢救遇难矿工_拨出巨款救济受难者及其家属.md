Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 29th – Following the unfortunate explosion on February 22nd at the Karl Marx Coal Mine in Zwickau, German Democratic Republic, rescue work has been proceeding day and night under the leadership of the Government Commission of the German Democratic Republic and with the strong support of various parts of the country and some fraternal countries.

Through the courageous rescue efforts of the rescue team, fifty-one miners have been saved. Some of the injured are receiving the best medical care and nursing.

According to a statement issued by the Government Commission, which is leading the rescue work on the scene, the rescue team encountered a major source of fire from the evening of February 27th to the morning of February 28th, thereby losing any possibility of advancing. After studying the situation with the mine rescue organization and some well-known experts, the Government Commission unanimously concluded that due to the enormous scale and duration of the disaster, the lives of the seventy-four people still remaining in the mine had ceased, and rescue was hopeless. Thus, together with the forty-nine deaths previously identified, a total of one hundred and twenty-three miners tragically perished.

The Government Commission has instructed three expert working groups to continue their work in order to determine the cause of the mine explosion.

People throughout the German Democratic Republic deeply mourn the miners who sacrificed their lives for the country's socialist construction. The Republic's government and the Free German Trade Union Federation have allocated huge sums of money to aid the victims and their families. At present, various follow-up measures are being vigorously implemented.

    德政府大力抢救遇难矿工
    拨出巨款救济受难者及其家属
    新华社柏林29日电　德意志民主共和国兹维考城卡尔·马克思煤矿2月22日发生不幸的爆炸事件后，在德意志民主共和国政府委员会的领导及全国各地和一些兄弟国家的大力支援下，营救工作夜以继日地进行。
    经过营救队的奋勇抢救，已有五十一名矿工被拯救出来。其中的一部分受伤者正得到最好的医疗和护理。
    据在现场领导营救工作的政府委员会发表的公告说，营救队从2月27日晚间到28日清晨遇到了一处大火源，从而丧失了任何前进的可能性。政府委员会同矿井救护机构和一些著名专家研究情况后一致认为，由于大灾规模巨大、持续时间过长，尚留在矿井的七十四人的生命已经停止，拯救无望。这样，连同前已查明的四十九名死者在内，共有一百二十三名矿工不幸牺牲。
    政府委员会责成三个专家工作组继续进行工作，以便查明矿井爆炸的原因。
    德意志民主共和国全国各地的人民深深哀悼为国家的社会主义建设而牺牲的矿工。共和国政府和自由德国工会联合会已经拨出巨款来救济受难者及其家属。现在，各种善后措施正在大力执行中。
