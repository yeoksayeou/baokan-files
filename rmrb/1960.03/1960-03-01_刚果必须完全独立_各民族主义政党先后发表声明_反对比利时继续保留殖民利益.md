Congo Must Achieve Complete Independence
Various Nationalist Parties Issue Statements
Against Belgium Continuing to Retain Colonial Interests

    This newspaper reports that some major nationalist parties in the Congo have recently expressed opposition to the Belgian colonial government retaining any rights in the Congo after its independence on June 30.

    Joseph Kasavubu, the chairman of the ABAKO party of the Congo, emphasized in a statement to reporters in Brussels on February 20 that the Congo should achieve complete and unrestricted independence. Prior to this, the Congolese Political Parties Alliance, composed of seven parties including the ABAKO party, the Congo National Movement (Kasavubu faction), the African Solidarity Party, and the People's Party, issued a communiqué on the issue of Congo's independence, stating that "the parties of the alliance completely reject incomplete independence. They believe that independence means that the Congo enjoys all rights of international sovereignty without reservation."

    Some major parties in the Congo also oppose the Belgian King serving as the head of state of the independent Congo.

    It is reported that although the Belgian colonialists were forced to announce their agreement for the Congo to achieve independence on June 30 of this year, they are still attempting to continue controlling the independent Congo through economic and other means to preserve their colonial interests; the Belgian Minister for Congolese Affairs has also hinted that the Belgian King intends to serve as the future head of state of the Congo.

    刚果必须完全独立
    各民族主义政党先后发表声明
    反对比利时继续保留殖民利益
    本报讯　刚果一些主要的民族主义政党最近都表示反对比利时殖民政府在刚果6月30日独立后仍对刚果保留任何权利。
    刚果阿巴科党主席卡萨武布2月20日在布鲁塞尔向新闻记者发表声明时强调刚果应取得完全和毫无限制的独立。在这之前，由阿巴科党、刚果民族运动党（卡萨吉派）、非洲团结党、人民党等七个政党组成的刚果政党联盟就刚果独立问题发表的公报指出，“联盟各政党完全拒绝不完整的独立。他们认为，独立意味着刚果毫无保留地享有一切国际主权的权利。”
    刚果的一些主要政党还反对比利时国王担任独立后的刚果元首。
    据报道，比利时殖民者虽被迫宣布同意刚果在今年6月30日实现独立，但仍企图通过经济等方面继续控制独立后的刚果以保存其殖民利益；比利时的刚果事务大臣还曾暗示比利时国王有意担任刚果今后的元首。
