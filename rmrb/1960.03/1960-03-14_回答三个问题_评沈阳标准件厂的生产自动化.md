    Answering Three Questions
     ——On the Production Automation of Shenyang Standard Parts Factory

    Can enterprises with backward equipment and technology engage in mechanization and automation? Will the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution affect current production? Must technical innovation and technical revolution, the realization of mechanization, automation, and electrification, go through a long process, or can they be done quickly? The experience of the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory raises these three questions and answers them affirmatively.

    Some say that modern enterprises have a good material and technical foundation, so they can carry out technical revolution and automation quickly. However, enterprises with backward equipment and low technical levels find it difficult to achieve high speed in technical revolution and automation. This statement has only a partial truth and is actually wrong. First of all, it should be recognized that enterprises with relatively poor equipment and technical foundations also have greater potential, so they should carry out technical revolution more quickly in order to rapidly change their backwardness, greatly increase production, and meet national requirements. Secondly, compared with enterprises with good equipment and technical foundations, these types of enterprises have worse objective conditions for carrying out technical revolution and automation, but it cannot be said that more difficulties prevent them from achieving high speed. The Shenyang Standard Parts Factory is a vivid example. They mainly started automation on the basis of old equipment from the puppet Manchukuo period, and in the short period of nearly one month from January 24 to February 23, they established fifteen automatic lines and made a large number of automated single machines. Adding to the one automatic line created earlier, they dramatically increased the factory's automation level from about 23% in 1957 to over 71%. Their experience tells us that whether or not technical revolution and automation can achieve high speed, the primary issue is not the quality of the equipment and technical foundation or the number of difficulties, but whether or not we can summon up enough energy and vigorously launch a mass movement. If enterprises with good conditions do not summon up enough energy and do not vigorously launch a mass movement, but lack enthusiasm and rely only on the efforts of a few people, they cannot achieve high speed. Regardless of whether the conditions are poor or good, enterprises can only fully mobilize the masses, vigorously launch a mass movement, so that every employee can muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, work hard, specially hard, and cleverly hard, with everyone using their brains and everyone doing their part, racing against time day and night, bringing greater strength to do more work, using greater diligence to make more innovations, and thinking of more ways to overcome more difficulties, to ensure that the technical revolution "passes five passes and cuts six generals", achieving successive victories, reaching more, faster, better, and more economical results, and achieving high speed. Secondly, the experience of the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory also shows that to ensure high-speed development of technical revolution and automation, it is also necessary to resolutely implement the principles of self-reliance, combining foreign and local methods, and making use of existing conditions during the movement. Regardless of whether the conditions are good or bad, enterprises carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution must solve some problems and difficulties. If they all reach out to the state for solutions, or all want to take the path of large-scale foreign methods, waiting for automation, the result can only be less, slower, worse, and more expensive. The workers of the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory adopted an attitude of self-reliance and combined foreign and local methods to deal with these problems. They did everything themselves, using their own hands and brains, looking for waste materials themselves when they needed materials, and using indigenous methods for processing when there was no special equipment, thus quickly overcoming various difficulties and winning high speed.

    The long-term interests of developing technical revolution and production are completely consistent, a principle that is immediately apparent. However, some people still believe that carrying out technical revolution will always affect the completion of current production tasks. Carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution takes time, manpower, and equipment, which seems to delay production, but if technical innovation and technical revolution are carried out quickly and well, it will greatly promote production. There are now two situations. One situation is to carry out technical revolution on a large scale, with great determination, full of energy, and quick action, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, drawing up a battle plan, arranging the current production, and then mobilizing all personnel to concentrate their forces on batch attacks, one battle after another, taking down one batch and then working on another. In this way, it can be ensured that technical innovation yields results quickly and the quality is good. On the one hand, it minimizes the production time occupied by technical innovation, and on the other hand, it quickly puts those innovative projects that can greatly increase production into production, which can not only quickly make up for short-term underproduction, but also greatly promote current production. The other situation is to carry out technical revolution on a small and slow scale, with a hesitant attitude, little determination, insufficient energy, and slow action, so the masses are not fully mobilized. As a result, it is inevitable that an innovation cannot be completed for a long time, or if it is completed, there are many problems that have not been resolved in a timely manner and cannot be put into normal production. This long-term occupation of equipment, manpower, and materials to fight a "war of attrition" will certainly affect production. The Shenyang Standard Parts Factory adopted the former attitude, doing a fast and good job of achieving automation, and taking certain measures to ensure that new creations could be quickly put into normal production. As a result, innovation not only did not affect current production, but also promoted the completion of the production plan ahead of schedule in January and February. It can be seen that the contradiction between technical revolution and current production can be completely unified and resolved. The important thing is that we must carry out technical revolution on a large scale, not on a small scale; we should only do it quickly, not slowly.

    回答三个问题
     ——评沈阳标准件厂的生产自动化
    设备、技术落后的企业，能不能搞机械化、自动化呢？开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，会不会影响当前的生产呢？技术革新和技术革命、实现机械化、自动化、电气化，必须经过一个漫长的过程呢，还是可以搞得很快呢？沈阳标准件厂的经验正是提出了这样三个问题，又肯定地回答了这样三个问题。
    有人说，现代化的企业物质、技术基础好，搞技术革命和实现自动化等能够快；可是设备落后、技术水平低的企业，搞技术革命、实现自动化等就很难高速度。这话只有片面的道理，实际是错误的。首先应该认识，设备、技术基础比较差的企业，潜力也比较大，因此就应该更快地搞技术革命，这样才能更迅速地改变落后面貌，大大提高生产，适应国家要求。其次，这类企业搞技术革命和自动化等，比起设备、技术基础好的企业，客观条件是差一些，可是并不能说困难比较多就不能实现高速度。沈阳标准件厂，就是一个生动的例子。他们就主要是在伪满时期的老旧设备的基础上搞起自动化的，而且从1月24日到2月23日短短的近一个月内，就建立了十五条自动线，做出大批的自动化单机，加上以前创造的一条自动线，就把全厂的自动化水平从1957年的23％左右，猛提到71％以上。他们的经验告诉我们，搞技术革命和实现自动化等，能不能高速度，首要的问题不在于设备、技术基础的好坏和困难的多少，而是在于能不能鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动。如果条件好的企业不鼓足干劲，不大搞群众运动，而是劲头不足，只靠少数人努力，也不可能有高速度。不管条件差还是条件好的企业，都只有像沈阳标准件厂那样，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，使每个职工都鼓起更大的革命干劲，大干、特干、苦干、巧干，人人动脑，个个动手，抢分夺秒日夜战斗，拿出更大的力量去作更多的工作，用更大的钻劲做出更多的革新创造，想更多的办法去战胜更多的困难，才能保证技术革命“过五关斩六将”，节节取胜，达到多快好省，实现高速度。其次，沈阳标准件厂的经验还说明，要保证高速度地开展技术革命和自动化等工作，还必须在运动中坚决执行自力更生、洋土结合、因陋就简的方针。不论条件好还是条件差的企业，开展技术革新和技术革命，都要解决一些这样那样的问题和困难，如果都伸手要求国家解决，或者都想走大的洋的道路，坐等自动化，结果只能是少慢差费。沈阳标准件厂职工，对待这些问题则采取自力更生的态度和洋土结合的办法。他们要做的事情都自己动手动脑，需要材料自己去找废旧材料，没有专用设备，就用土法加工，因此迅速克服了各种困难，赢得了高速度。
    开展技术革命和生产发展的长远利益完全一致，这个道理是一目了然的。但是还有些人认为开展技术革命总要影响当前生产任务的完成。开展技术革新和技术革命要占用时间、人力、设备，这似乎是耽误生产，但是如果把技术革新和技术革命搞得又快又好，就会大大地促进生产。现在有两种情况。一种情况，是对技术革命大搞特搞，决心大，劲头足，行动快，充分发动起群众的积极性和创造性，订好作战计划，安排好当前的生产，而后调动全部人马集中力量分批突击，一个战役接一个战役，拿下一批再搞一批。这样，便能保证技术革新收效快，质量又好；一方面使技术革新占用的生产时间很少，另方面使那些能够大大提高生产的革新项目很快投入生产，这样不仅能很快地补上短时间的欠产，而且能大大推动当前的生产。另一种是对技术革命运动小搞、慢搞，态度迟疑，决心不大，劲头不足，行动不快，因此群众发动得也不充分。结果就难免弄得很长时期也搞不成一项革新，或者搞出来了，又有许多问题没有及时解决，不能正常投入生产，这样长期地占用设备和人力、物力打“消耗战”，当然要影响生产。沈阳标准件厂，就是采取了前一种态度，把实现自动化的工作搞得又快又好，并且采取一定的措施使新的创造能迅速地投入正常生产，结果革新不但没有影响当前生产，反而促进1、2月份的生产都提前超额完成了计划。可见技术革命和当前生产的矛盾是完全可以求得统一和解决的，重要的是我们必须大搞技术革命，不应该小搞；只能快搞，不应该慢搞。
