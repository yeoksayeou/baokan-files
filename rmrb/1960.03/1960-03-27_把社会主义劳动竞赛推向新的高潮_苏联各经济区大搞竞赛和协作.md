Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th: The Soviet working people, fighting on the industrial front, have launched a socialist competition to strive for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan with even greater labor enthusiasm since the beginning of this year, pushing it to a new high. This competition has now exceeded the scope of last year's competition between industrial sectors and between enterprises, and has expanded into a widespread competition between economic zones. The common slogan proposed by the economic zones participating in the competition is: comprehensively improve production, strengthen mutual cooperation, and strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan one to two years ahead of schedule, and complete this year's production plan seven to ten days ahead of schedule through joint efforts.

The socialist labor competition movement between economic zones in the Soviet Union this year has been strong, and new initiatives have been quickly responded to across the country. The movement was initially launched by industrial enterprises in the Moscow economic zone. This economic zone proposed in early January to guarantee that it would not only complete the Seven-Year Plan for improving labor productivity two years ahead of schedule, but also complete the seven-year production plan and all other indicators originally scheduled to be reached in 1965 two years ahead of schedule, and called on other national economic zones to participate in the competition. The workers and staff of the Leningrad economic zone were the first to support this initiative, and they also decided to complete the seven-year industrial production plan two years ahead of schedule and to start a competition with the people of Moscow. The great competition between the Moscow and Leningrad economic zones greatly stimulated the communist labor enthusiasm of the workers and staff in other economic zones. Now, inter-regional competitions have been enthusiastically launched between Sverdlovsk and Dnepropetrovsk economic zones, between Kharkov and Novosibirsk, between Belarus and Stalingrad, between Azerbaijan and Bashkir economic zones, and between many other economic zones. The People's Daily editorial on March 21 pointed out that the scale of competition between economic zones in the Soviet Union has never been as broad and as mass-based as it is this year.

Although the competition between economic zones in the Soviet Union has only just begun, it has already produced good results. This movement has established and strengthened the ties between the national economic committees of the economic zones, between industrial enterprises, and between work teams and workers, greatly promoting their overall cooperation. In the competition, many national economic zones have included the early completion of orders for fraternal economic zones and fraternal units in their competition guarantees. For example, the Novosibirsk economic zone proposed to complete all orders for other economic zones before December 5 this year. In order to strengthen cooperation, the economic zones have also sent delegations to visit fraternal economic zones and exchange advanced experiences. Textile workers from Tajikistan recently visited a textile factory in Bukhara, Uzbekistan. During their visit, they put forward suggestions on yarn application and improvement of labor organization based on their own work experience. As a result, they helped the Bukhara textile workers greatly tap their production potential, enabling them to increase their labor productivity by 3% compared to the original plan. Steel workers from Zaporozhye and Dnepropetrovsk held joint meetings to exchange experiences. Steel workers from Zaporozhye introduced their experience in saving coke, which resulted in a significant reduction in coke consumption in the blast furnaces of the Dnepropetrovsk steel plant.

The competition movement between economic zones has greatly promoted the struggle for technological progress and the comprehensive mechanization and automation of the production process in the economic zones. For example, the Moscow (city) economic zone has proposed to install 60 automated production lines and 280 assembly lines this year, and to produce more than 1,000 new types of machines and equipment, and to implement comprehensive mechanization of production in four factories and thirty-two workshops. The Leningrad (city) economic zone has also proposed to install 478 automated production lines and assembly lines within this year, and to realize comprehensive mechanization of production in three factories, fifty-eight workshops, and one hundred and ninety-eight work sections. At present, good news of technological progress has been reported from many regions.

Due to the promotion of the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, the full exploitation of production potential, and the improvement of production technology, there are fewer and fewer backward factories, enterprises and units in the participating economic zones, and a new atmosphere of common upsurge has emerged. Backward units are decreasing day by day or even completely eliminated. For example, in the Lugansk economic zone, all factories completed their production plans ahead of schedule in January and February. The Stalino economic zone has now completely eliminated backward units. In the Konstantinovskiy district of this economic zone, the industrial sector had 288 backward collectives in October last year, and now there is not a single one.

    把社会主义劳动竞赛推向新的高潮
    苏联各经济区大搞竞赛和协作
    发扬互助协作精神，发掘生产潜力，提高生产技术水平，落后的工厂企业和单位逐日减少甚至完全消灭
    新华社莫斯科26日电　战斗在工业战线上的苏联劳动人民，今年以来以更高的劳动热情把争取提前完成七年计划的社会主义竞赛推向新高潮。这个竞赛目前已超出了去年在工业部门同工业部门之间、企业同企业之间的范围，而扩展为经济区同经济区之间广泛展开的竞赛。参加竞赛的经济区提出的共同口号是：全面提高生产，加强彼此间的协作，以共同的努力来争取提前一年到两年完成七年计划，并提前七天到十天完成今年的生产计划。
    今年苏联各国民经济区之间的社会主义劳动竞赛运动来势猛，新的倡议一出现，在全国各地就一呼百应，发展很快。运动最初是由莫斯科市经济区的工业企业发起的。这个经济区在1月初提出保证，不但要提前两年完成提高劳动生产率的七年计划，而且要提前两年完成七年的生产计划和七年计划原定在1965年达到的其他一切指标，并且号召其他国民经济区参加竞赛。列宁格勒市国民经济区的职工首先支持了这项倡议，他们也决定提前两年完成七年工业生产计划，并同莫斯科人展开竞赛。莫斯科市和列宁格勒市经济区的大竞赛，大大激起了其他经济区职工的共产主义劳动热情。现在，斯维德洛夫斯克和第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克经济区之间、哈尔科夫和新西伯利亚之间、白俄罗斯和斯大林格勒之间、阿塞拜疆和巴什基尔经济区之间，以及其他许多经济区之间，都已热烈展开了区际竞赛。真理报3月21日的社论指出，苏联各经济区之间的竞赛规模从来还没有像今年这样广泛，这样带有群众性。
    苏联各经济区之间的竞赛现在虽然才开始，但是已经产生了良好的结果。这一运动建立和加强了苏联各经济区国民经济委员会之间、各工业企业之间以及工作队之间和工人之间的联系，大大促进了它们之间的全面协作。在竞赛中，许多国民经济区都把提前完成兄弟经济区和兄弟单位的订货订在自己的竞赛保证书中。例如，新西伯利亚经济区就提出要在今年12月5日以前全部完成其他经济区的订货。为了加强协作，各国民经济区还派了代表团到兄弟经济区参观访问，互相交流先进经验。塔吉克的纺织工人不久以前到乌兹别克共和国布哈拉的纺织工厂中参观，他们在参观时根据自己的工作经验提出了上纱和改进劳动组织的建议，结果帮助布哈拉的纺织工人大大挖掘了生产潜力，使他们把劳动生产率比原订计划提高了3％。萨坡罗什和第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的钢铁工人，共同开会交流经验。萨坡罗什的炼钢工人介绍了节约焦炭的经验，结果使得第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克钢铁工厂的高炉的焦炭毫费量大大减少。
    国民经济区之间的竞赛运动，大大地促进了各国民经济区争取技术进步的斗争和生产过程的全面机械化和自动化。例如，莫斯科（市）国民经济区就提出要在今年安装六十条自动化作业线和二百八十条流水作业线，并且要生产一千种以上新式机器和设备，在四家工厂和三十二个车间实行生产全面机械化。列宁格勒（市）经济区也提出要在今年一年内安装四百七十八条自动化作业线和流水作业线，并使三家工厂、五十八个车间和一百九十八个工段实行生产全面机械化。目前，从不少地区已经传来技术进步的捷报。
    由于发扬了互助协作精神，充分挖掘了生产潜力和提高了生产技术水平，目前，在参加竞赛的各国民经济区中，落后的工厂企业和单位已越来越少，出现了彼此共同高涨的新气象。落后单位逐日减少甚至完全消灭，例如卢干斯克经济区，在1月和2月份所有工厂都提前完成了生产计划，斯大林诺经济区现在也全部消灭了落后单位。这个经济区的康斯坦丁诺夫区的工业部门在去年10月有二百八十八个落后集体，而现在连一个也没有了。
