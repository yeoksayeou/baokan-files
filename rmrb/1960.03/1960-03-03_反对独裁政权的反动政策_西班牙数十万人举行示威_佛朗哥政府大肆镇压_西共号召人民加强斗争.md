Opposing the Dictatorial Regime's Reactionary Policies
Hundreds of Thousands Demonstrate in Spain
Franco Government Cracks Down Vigorously; Spanish Communist Party Calls on People to Strengthen Struggle

    (Report from this newspaper) The Sixth Congress of the Spanish Communist Party, held not long ago, sent a letter to all parties and groups in Spain opposing the Franco regime, requesting that these parties and groups make contact with each other and jointly prepare for a round-table conference to reach an agreement, jointly organize and lead the anti-dictatorial struggle of all the Spanish people.

    The letter stated that large-scale protest movements have emerged in Spain, and the people are moving towards taking new large-scale mass movements to oppose the current state of affairs and oppose the dictatorship. Today, millions of Spaniards recognize the need to take actions of this nature.

    The recent struggle launched by the Spanish people is to oppose Franco's implementation of the so-called "stabilization plan," which is actually an impoverishment plan imposed on the Spanish people by imperialist monopoly capital groups. Hundreds of thousands of urban and rural laborers in Spain have recently held demonstrations against this plan. Workers in Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville have held multiple demonstrations. Even members of the petty and middle bourgeoisie have supported this struggle because this plan has also brought disastrous consequences to them.

    The Spanish Franco dictatorial regime, aware of this explosive situation, has strengthened its repression of the people. According to a report in the Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" on February 26, it is estimated that one thousand people have been detained in the current large-scale arrests in Spain. Some communists and progressives have been arrested on charges of so-called "subversive activities," including the writer Luis Goytisolo. To create a pretext, the Spanish police even imitated Hitler's trick of burning down the Reichstag, "discovering" a time bomb in the Prado Museum. This arrest is the largest persecution of democratic forces by the Franco regime in recent years. The Soviet "Izvestia," in commenting on this matter, wrote: Twenty-seven years ago, Hitler, in order to oppose communism, burned down the Reichstag, which was a signal for the barbarous persecution of all progressive forces in Germany. And now, the Spanish authorities, due to their difficult situation, are trying to repeat this historical farce. Franco has decided to use the Prado Museum to achieve his own despicable goals. The commentary pointed out that the purpose of the Franco authorities in adopting this method is to attempt to prevent new mass anti-dictatorial movements. To this end, they first want to undermine the prestige of the Spanish Communists among the people and arbitrarily accuse the Communists of engaging in terrorist activities. The bomb farce also serves to justify the persecution carried out by Spain in front of other countries.

    Observers in Madrid pointed out that Eisenhower's recent visit to Madrid was an encouragement to Franco's tyranny.

    However, the Franco regime's brutal repression cannot shake the Spanish people's determination to fight against dictatorship. The French "L'Humanité" published a detailed summary of the statement of the Executive Committee of the Spanish Communist Party on February 27, stating: The struggle against repression must be strengthened, and there must be no concession to the intimidation imposed by the government.

### 反对独裁政权的反动政策  西班牙数十万人举行示威  佛朗哥政府大肆镇压　西共号召人民加强斗争

    反对独裁政权的反动政策
    西班牙数十万人举行示威
    佛朗哥政府大肆镇压　西共号召人民加强斗争
    本报讯　不久前举行的西班牙共产党第六次代表大会向西班牙各反对佛朗哥政党和团体发出一封信，要求这些政党和团体进行接触，共同筹备召开圆桌会议，以便达成协议，共同组织和领导全体西班牙人民的反独裁斗争。
    这封信说，在西班牙已经出现了大规模的抗议运动，人民正在走向采取新的大规模群众运动来反对目前的状态、反对独裁，今天数以百万计的西班牙人都认识到有必要采取这种性质的行动。
    西班牙人民最近展开的斗争是为了反对佛朗哥执行所谓“稳定计划”，这个计划其实是由帝国主义垄断资本集团强加于西班牙人民的贫困计划。几十万西班牙城乡劳动者最近举行示威，反对这个计划。马德里、巴塞罗那、塞维尔的工人都多次举行了示威。甚至中小资产阶级人士也纷纷支持这个斗争，因为这个计划也给他们带来灾难性的后果。
    西班牙佛朗哥独裁政权意识到这种爆炸性的局势，加强了对人民的镇压，据捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”2月26日报道，在目前的西班牙的大逮捕中，据估计被拘留的有一千人。一些共产党员和进步人士在所谓从事“颠复活动”的罪名下被捕，其中包括作家路易斯·戈伊蒂索洛。为了制造借口，西班牙警察甚至仿效希特勒烧毁国会的故伎，在普拉多博物馆“发现了”定时炸弹。这次逮捕是佛朗哥政权几年来对民主力量最大的迫害。苏联“消息报”在评论这件事情时写道：二十七年前，希特勒为了反共，烧毁了国会大厦，这是野蛮迫害德国一切进步力量的信号。而现在，西班牙当局由于处境困难，竟想重演历史丑剧，佛朗哥决定利用普拉多博物馆来达到自己卑鄙的目的。评论指出，佛朗哥当局采取这种手段的目的在于企图预防新的群众性的反独裁运动。为此，他们首先想破坏西班牙共产党人在人民中的威信，硬把进行恐怖活动的罪名加在共产党人的头上。演出炸弹滑稽剧还在于要在别的国家面前为西班牙进行的迫害作辩护。
    马德里的观察家指出，艾森豪威尔不久以前对马德里的访问是对佛朗哥虐政的鼓励。
    但是，佛朗哥政权的残酷镇压决不能动摇西班牙人民反独裁斗争的决心。法国“人道报”2月27日刊载了西班牙共产党执行委员会的声明的详细摘要，声明指出：必须加强反对镇压的斗争，决不对政府所施加的恫吓让步。
