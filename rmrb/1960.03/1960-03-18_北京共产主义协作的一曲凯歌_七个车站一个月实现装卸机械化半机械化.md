Beijing's five key freight stations and two medium and small stations, as well as four transport lines dozens of kilometers long, have rapidly achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading. This is a significant achievement made by Beijing's transportation departments, factories, enterprises, government offices, and neighborhood communities, under the unified leadership of Party organizations, breaking down unit boundaries, promoting the spirit of Communist cooperation, and using a large-scale battle approach to jointly overcome weak links. During the movement, relevant central departments and some factories in Taiyuan and Tianjin also came to provide support.

The practice of breaking down industry boundaries and jointly tackling the loading and unloading challenge began in Xuanwu District. Under the leadership of the Party, more than 10,000 employees in this district launched a large-scale Communist collaboration. In just twenty days, they basically achieved the mechanization of loading and unloading at Guang'anmen Station and Xibianmen Station, as well as the warehouses and transportation tools such as automobiles, horse-drawn carts, and flatbed carts connected to these two stations. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote the four experiences of this district in achieving high-speed mechanization of loading and unloading: strengthening Party leadership and adhering to putting politics in command; breaking down unit boundaries and promoting the spirit of Communist cooperation; vigorously launching mass movements and organizing large-scale battles; and working diligently, self-reliantly, and implementing the policy of walking on two legs with both indigenous and foreign methods. It also called on the transportation departments and factory enterprise employees in the city to learn from the practices of Xuanwu District and seize total victory in one go.

After the on-site meeting, a technical revolution movement to vigorously promote loading and unloading mechanization spread throughout the city's transportation front. The battle was carried out by district. Each district took its key railway station as the main target, led by the district party secretary and specifically directed by the district head, organizing a technical revolution army of thousands of people to implement large-scale battles. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 420 units, more than 50,000 employees, teachers, students, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and neighborhood residents participated in this movement. The scope and scale were unprecedented on the transportation front.

During the movement, Party committees at all levels set up special leading bodies to strengthen centralized leadership, ensuring that they grasped the work firmly at each level and that the leadership was meticulous and specific. Whether manufacturing complex machinery or simple machinery, there were specialized units responsible for it, with delivery dates stipulated. In the process of collaborative manufacturing of machinery, each cooperating unit strictly followed the plan to complete its tasks. Therefore, in just one month, nearly 5,000 pieces of handling and loading machinery and tools were produced, increasing the degree of loading and unloading mechanization from 12.6% to more than 70%, and increasing loading and unloading efficiency by more than one time.

In the movement to fight for the mechanization of loading, unloading and handling, vivid scenes of Communist cooperation could be seen everywhere. Dongjiao Station needed a five-ton electric hoist to assemble a gantry crane. Upon hearing this news, the employees of the Beijing No. 3 General Machinery Factory immediately sent an electric hoist that they needed for their own technical revolution to the station. When the employees of the Materials Supply Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications were picking up goods at Fengtai Station, they learned that the station lacked some materials for its large-scale loading and unloading mechanization efforts. They immediately sent eighty sets of bearings by truck and also supported three hundred kilograms of silicon steel sheets. The Tianjin Machine Tool Factory also sent six motors and a belt conveyor to Fengtai Station by truck.

Currently, the technical revolution armies in various districts of Beijing are going all out to fight hard in March, striving to basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling and unloading in all factories, enterprises, construction sites, warehouses, etc., within one month.

    北京共产主义协作的一曲凯歌
    七个车站一个月实现装卸机械化半机械化
    本报讯　北京五个重点货运车站和两个中、小型车站，以及四条数十公里长的运输流水线，迅速实现了装卸机械化半机械化。这是北京运输部门、工厂企业和机关、街道，在党组织的统一领导下，打破单位界限，发扬共产主义协作精神，用大兵团作战的方法共同突破薄弱环节，取得的显著成果。在运动中，中央有关部门和太原、天津有的工厂也都赶来支援。
    打破行业界限，协力攻打装卸关的做法，是从宣武区开始的。这个区的一万多名职工在党的领导下，开展共产主义大协作，只用了二十天时间，就使广安门车站和西便门车站，以及与这两个车站相联系的仓库和汽车、马车、排子车等运输工具，基本实现了装卸机械化。中共北京市委立即召开现场会议，推广这个区高速度实现装卸机械化的四项经验：加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅；打破单位界限，发扬共产主义协作精神；大搞群众运动，组织大兵团作战；穷干苦干，自力更生，贯彻土洋并举两条腿走路的方针。并且号召全市运输部门和工厂企业职工学习宣武区的做法，一鼓作气夺取全胜。
    现场会议以后，大搞装卸机械化的技术革命运动，就在全市运输战线扩展开来。战斗以区为单位进行。各区都以自己所属的重点火车站为主要目标，由区委书记挂帅，区长具体指挥，组织成千上万人的技术革命大军，实行大兵团作战。根据不完全统计，参加这次运动的共有四百二十多个单位，五万多名职工、师生、解放军官兵和街道居民，范围之广，规模之大，在运输战线上空前未有。
    在运动中，各级党委都设有专门领导机构，加强集中领导，作到了层层狠抓，领导细致具体。无论制造复杂机械和简单机械，都有专门单位负责，规定交货日期。各协作单位在分工制造机械的过程中，都严格按照计划完成任务。因此，在短短的一个月内，就突击制成近五千件搬运装卸机械和工具，使装卸机械化程度由12．6％猛增到70％以上，装卸效率提高一倍以上。
    在为装卸搬运机械化而战的运动中，到处可以看到共产主义大协作的生动场面。东郊车站装配一台龙门吊，缺少一个五吨的电动小吊车。北京市第三通用机械厂职工们听到这个消息，立刻把自己在技术革命中需要的一台电动小吊车送到车站。邮电部器材供应处的职工在丰台车站提货时，了解到该站在大搞装卸机械化中缺少一些材料，他们立即派汽车送来八十套轴承，还支援了三百公斤矽钢片。天津机床厂也派汽车给丰台站送来六台电动机、一台皮带运输机。
    目前，北京各区的技术革命大军，正在鼓足干劲，大战3月，力争在一个月内使全市各个工厂企业、工地、仓库等搬运装卸，基本实现机械化、半机械化。（附图片）
