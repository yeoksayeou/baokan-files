The lives of working women in capitalist countries are extremely impoverished and miserable. They are deprived of the basic political, economic, cultural and social rights they should have as human beings.

	Denied True Political Rights

In many capitalist countries, women still do not have equal political rights with men. Although some countries have laws stipulating that women enjoy the right to vote and to be elected, in reality, women, especially working women, do not truly enjoy these basic political rights. Take the United States, which is touted as a Western "bastion of democracy," for example. In the current Senate and House of Representatives, there are only eighteen female members, accounting for only 3.18% of the total number of members. In the United Kingdom, which was one of the first countries to implement parliamentary democracy, in the last parliament, there were only twenty-four female members in the House of Commons out of six hundred and thirty members, accounting for only 3.8%; in the House of Lords, there were four female members out of eight hundred and seventy members, accounting for less than 0.46% of the total. As for France, which the bourgeoisie often touts as an example of "liberty, equality, and fraternity," women did not obtain the right to vote and be elected until the end of World War II in 1945, and even now French women are still deprived of the right to hold a series of administrative positions. The situation of Japanese women is even worse. For many centuries, they have been deprived of political rights. After World War II, although some democratic reforms were implemented domestically and women obtained the right to vote, at present, American imperialism is colluding with the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary government to revive Japanese militarism, and democratic movement fighters are often persecuted and suppressed. The so-called rights of women are merely a formality.

Even if a few women in these countries become members of parliament, this is only a decoration of so-called equality between men and women in capitalist society, and they only represent the interests of the bourgeoisie. The voices of the vast number of working women are not reflected at all. In some countries like the United States, where racial discrimination policies prevail, the political rights of non-white women are even more unreasonably deprived.

	Seen as "Surplus People"

The economic rights of working women in capitalist countries are even more insecure. They are often seen as "surplus people" and are excluded from many jobs. Even if they have jobs, they do not receive equal treatment as men, and are often dismissed by bosses at will under various pretexts. According to official U.S. statistics, as of February last year, women accounted for 29.3% of the total number of unemployed people in the United States. In the United States, married women are particularly discriminated against, and some American companies openly declare that they will not hire married women. As for British women, they are assigned a "priority" right to unemployment. In this "civilized" country, during the crisis of the 1930s, it was stipulated that if any enterprise wanted to dismiss workers, it should first dismiss married female workers. Although this decree has been abolished, it is still used by many business owners to this day.

A large number of women are forced to sell their bodies in exchange for a few dollars to survive because they have no means of livelihood. In many capitalist countries, the number of prostitutes has been increasing in recent years, and incidents of trafficking in women are prevalent in some countries. According to the lowest estimate by the prosecutor in charge of morality cases at the special court of the Paris High Court, the number of women currently engaged in prostitution in France is more than 25,000. In Paris alone, there are more than 10,000 prostitutes registered with the police. As for the number of amateur prostitutes, it is even greater. The phenomenon of women selling their children because they cannot afford to raise them is also becoming increasingly common in capitalist countries. Last year, a huge black market center for selling babies was uncovered in the United States, which bought a large number of babies from many capitalist countries at low prices for resale for profit. The British "Daily Mirror" reported that there is also a black market for children in London. How many mothers' tears are shed in these transactions!

The pot-bellied capitalists of the capitalist world sometimes hire some women in order to exploit cheap labor. However, these women do not receive the same pay as men. The average wage of female workers in the United States has always been 40% lower than the average wage of male workers. This difference has been widening in recent years. The situation is similar in the United Kingdom and France.

Women in capitalist countries not only do not have equal rights in politics and economics, but they are also often discriminated against in all aspects of life, such as cultural education, social activities, and family marriage. In order to maintain this unequal and sinful system, some bourgeois publications are still promoting the decadent theory of inequality between men and women, clamoring that "women do not have sufficient value in biology," advocating that women's position is in the family, and inheriting Hitler's fascist theory of women returning to the kitchen. Obviously, the bourgeoisie is trying to make the vast number of women, especially working women, disengage from politics and class struggle. But their effect does not seem to be that good. Real life educates the oppressed women of capitalist countries, and they are increasingly involved in the struggle for survival, democracy, freedom, and the defense of peace.

	Struggles are Flourishing

In the various struggles of the American people to defend their own rights, oppose racial discrimination, and oppose the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, there is an increasing number of women participating.

In France, women have shown a high degree of combativeness in opposing de Gaulle's personal autocratic system and opposing the government's reactionary economic measures that make the working people increasingly impoverished. They oppose increasing labor intensity, oppose dismissing women first, and protest against reducing family allowances and reactionary measures that harm social insurance. In a factory in Pontarlier, female workers forced the factory to implement the principle of "equal pay for equal work" for men and women after a three-week strike. French women are also active members in the movement to defend world peace.

The working women of the United Kingdom have been waging fierce battles against the Conservative government for their freedom and equality.

Women in West Germany are also carrying out unremitting struggles under fascist reactionary rule. 100,000 textile workers in the Rhine held a strike, and about 100,000 textile workers in Westphalia and Lower Saxony also carried out a strike struggle, and thus won the victory of increasing wages. West German women also actively participate in the struggle for negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany, negotiations between the two Germanies, thereby restoring German unity, opposing American imperialism and its partners' atomic arming of West Germany, and opposing the war preparations of West German militarists.

In Japan, women's fighting spirit is even more vigorous. In order to defend their own and their children's rights, defend peace, and get rid of the sea of suffering of being enslaved and insulted by American imperialism and the domestic reactionary ruling class, the vast number of Japanese women actively participate in the nationwide struggle for independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy. Last year, the Japanese people launched a huge wave of opposition to revising and striving to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Since April last year to the present, many women's organizations of the Japanese people have also launched a series of activities centered on opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and mobilized the vast number of women to participate in the struggle. For example, the "Women's Council for the Protection of Human Rights," composed of forty-four women's groups, held a "Mothers and Daughters Conference" in Tokyo on July 20 last year, attended by 1,000 women, opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty." On November 21, more than 2,500 women in Tokyo, under the call of the council, braved the heavy rain to hold a demonstration parade with their children and daughters. On January 12 this year, the council held a "Mothers and Daughters Grief Conference." More than 300 women who participated in the conference wore black veils on their chests to express their irrepressible anger and protest. In the past year, in addition to opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Japanese women have also carried out struggles to defend peace, oppose nuclear armament, demand the return of Okinawa by the United States, and safeguard the rights of mothers and improve their lives. In this series of struggles, Japanese female workers and workers' families are a core force. At present, the Japanese people are launching an even higher wave of enthusiasm to prevent the Diet from ratifying this new military treaty. Forty-six Japanese women's groups have decided to hold mass rallies across the country on April 16 this year. In this year's "Women's Month" activity slogan to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, it also prominently put forward "Oppose the New Japan-U.S. Security Treaty."

In today's struggle of the people of the world for peace, democracy, and progress, the oppressed women of capitalist countries have become a force that cannot be ignored. The happy lives of women in socialist countries who have gained true liberation are increasingly encouraging their struggles. At the same time, their every struggle action is regarded by their sisters in socialist countries as their own struggle, and they are given strong support. There is no doubt that in the 1960s, the women's movement in the capitalist world will develop more vigorously and achieve greater victories.

    另一个世界妇女的生活和斗争
    在资本主义国家的劳动妇女的生活是极端贫困和悲惨的，她们被剥夺了作为人应有的政治、经济、文化和社会等各方面的基本权利。
    得不到真正的政治权利
    在许多资本主义国家中妇女至今仍然没有同男子平等的政治权利。一部分国家虽然有法律明文规定着妇女享有选举权和被选举权，但是实际上妇女们特别是劳动妇女们却并没有真正享受到这种基本的政治权利。就拿被吹嘘为西方的“民主堡垒”的美国来说，本届参议、众议两院中女议员只有十八人，只占议员总数的3．18％。实行议会民主最早的英国，上届议会里，下院六百三十个议员中，女议员只有二十四人，仅占总数的3．8％；上院八百七十个议员中，女议员四人，还不到总数的0．46％。至于被资产阶级经常鼓吹为“自由、平等、博爱”榜样的法国，妇女们一直到1945年第二次世界大战结束，才第一次获得了选举和被选举权，而且法国妇女到现在仍然还被剥夺了从事一系列行政上职务的权利。日本妇女的情况更加糟糕，许多世纪以来她们都被剥夺了政治上的权利，第二次世界大战后，国内尽管实行了一点民主改革，妇女得到了选举权，但目前，美帝国主义勾结岸信介反动政府，复活日本军国主义，民主运动战士经常遭到迫害和镇压，妇女们的所谓权利也只是徒具形式而已。
    这些国家纵然有少数妇女当上了议员，这也不过是资本主义社会里所谓男女平等的一种点缀，而且她们代表的只是资产阶级的利益，广大劳动妇女的呼声根本得不到反映。而在像美国这样一些种族歧视政策盛行的国家中，非白种妇女的政治权利更是受到无理的剥夺。
    被看作“过剩的人”
    资本主义国家中劳动妇女的经济权利更是毫无保障，她们往往被看作是“过剩的人”，在许多工作岗位上受到排斥，有了工作，也得不到同男子平等的待遇，而且常常被老板以各种借口随便解雇，根据美国官方统计，到去年2月止，美国失业总人数中妇女就占29．3％。在美国，已婚妇女特别受到歧视，美国有些企业公开宣布拒收已婚妇女。至于英国的妇女就更是被派定了一种“优先”失业的权利。在这个“文明”国家，在三十年代的危机时期曾经规定，任何企业如果要开除工人，就应首先开除已婚女工，以后这一法令虽已废除，但实际上到现在还被许多企业老板沿用。
    大批妇女因为苦无生计，被迫出卖自己的身体来换取几个活命钱。在许多资本主义国家中，近年来娼妓的数目都在激增，而且在一些国家流行贩卖妇女的事件。据巴黎最高法院专院负责有关风化案件的检察官的最低的估计，目前法国以卖淫为职业的女子，数目在两万五千以上。仅巴黎一地在警察局登记了的妓女便超过一万。至于业余的卖淫妇女数目，也就更多了。妇女因无力抚育儿女而卖儿鬻女的现象，在资本主义国家中也日益普遍。美国去年就有一个巨大的贩卖婴儿的黑市中心被揭发，它从许多资本主义国家以贱价买入大批婴儿贩卖赢利。英国“每日镜报”曾报道过，伦敦也存在着儿童的黑市买卖。在这些买卖中，浸透着多少母亲的眼泪啊！
    资本主义世界大腹便便的资本家，为了剥削廉价的劳动力，有时也雇用一些妇女。但是这些妇女却得不到同男人相同的报酬。在美国女工的平均工资一直比男工的平均工资低40％。最近几年这种差别还在扩大，在英国和法国，情况也差不多。
    资本主义国家的妇女不仅在政治和经济上没有平等权利，她们在文化教育、社会活动、家庭婚姻等生活各个方面也往往受到歧视。为了维护这种不平等的罪恶制度，一些资产阶级的出版物到现在还在宣扬关于男女不平等的腐朽理论。叫嚷“妇女在生物学上没有充分价值”，主张妇女的岗位是在家庭里，继承着希特勒要妇女回到厨房的法西斯理论。很显然，资产阶级企图使得广大的妇女，特别是劳动妇女脱离政治、脱离阶级斗争。但是他们的效果看来并不那样好。现实生活教育着资本主义各国受压迫的妇女，她们越来越多地投入了争取生存、民主、自由和保卫和平的斗争。
    斗争在蓬勃开展
    在美国人民保卫切身权利、反对种族歧视、反对扩军备战政策等各个斗争中，都有着日益增多的妇女参加。
    在法国，妇女们在反对戴高乐的个人专权制度和反对政府使劳动人民日益贫困的反动经济措施上，表现了高度的战斗性。她们反对提高劳动强度，反对首先解雇妇女，抗议减少家庭补助金和损害社会保险的反动措施。在邦塔尔列的一个工厂里，由于女工们坚持了三个星期的罢工，迫使厂方实行了男女“同工同酬”的原则。法国妇女在保卫世界和平运动中，也是积极参加的成员。
    英国的劳动妇女们一直在为自己的自由和平等对保守党政府展开激烈的战斗。
    西德的妇女在法西斯反动统治下，也进行着不懈的斗争。莱因十万纺织工人曾举行了罢工，威斯特伐利亚和下萨克森行政区也有约十万纺织工人进行了罢工斗争，并因此取得增加工资的胜利。西德妇女还积极参加争取对德和约谈判、全德谈判，从而恢复德国统一的斗争，反对美帝国主义及其伙伴对西德进行原子武装，反对西德的军国主义者的备战活动。
    在日本，妇女们的斗志更是旺盛。日本广大妇女为了保卫自身和孩子们的权利，保卫和平，摆脱被美帝国主义和国内反动统治阶级的奴役和凌辱的苦海，积极参加到全民的争取独立、和平、中立和民主的斗争行列。去年，日本人民掀起了反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的巨浪。从去年4月以来到现在，日本人民的许多妇女组织也以反对修改日美“安全条约”为中心展开了一系列活动，发动广大妇女参加斗争。比如，由四十四个妇女团体组成的“保卫人权妇女协议会”，去年7月20日在东京就召开了一千名妇女参加的反对修改“安全条约”的“母亲和女儿大会”，11月21日东京二千五百多名妇女又在该会号召下，携儿扶女地冒着大雨举行了示威游行。今年1月12日该会举行了“母亲和女儿悲愤大会”，参加大会的三百多妇女都在胸前佩戴黑纱，表示她们不可抑止的愤怒和抗议。在去年一年里，日本妇女在反对日美“安全条约”之外，还进行了保卫和平、反对核武装、要求美国归还冲绳岛以及维护作为母亲的权利，改善生活的斗争，在这一连串的斗争中，日本女职工和工人家属是一支核心的力量。目前，日本人民正在为阻止国会批准这一新的军事条约掀起更加高涨的热浪，日本四十六个妇女团体已决定今年4月16日在全国各地举行群众大会，在今年纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年的“妇女月”活动口号中，也突出地提出了“反对新日美安全条约”。
    在今天全世界人民争取和平、民主和进步的斗争中，资本主义国家被压迫的妇女已成为一支不可忽视的力量。社会主义国家已经获得了真正解放的妇女的幸福生活日益鼓舞着她们的斗争，同时她们的每个斗争行动都被社会主义国家的姊妹看成是自己的斗争，而给予大力的支持。毫无疑问，在六十年代中资本主义世界的妇女运动将会有更蓬勃的开展，并且取得更大的胜利。
