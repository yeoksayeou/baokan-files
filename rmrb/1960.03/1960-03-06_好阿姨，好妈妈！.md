　　Good Aunts, Good Mothers!
　　Zeng Zijian Xu Chuanmao

　　The Shanghai No. 542 Factory's kindergarten used to be a day-care center. Every day, mothers would send their beloved little ones to the kindergarten and go to work with peace of mind, but as soon as evening came, they would have to rush to pick up their children. Some mothers had to give up their evening political studies or meaningful gatherings and meetings because of this. Seeing this situation, the kindergarten's aunts felt uneasy. They thought: they had left their own families to do childcare work to allow mothers to work in production with peace of mind. As things stood now, mothers still couldn't be worry-free! What should they do? They should work harder themselves, so they proposed temporary half-night care, temporary full-night care and other measures. When mothers were late, they would always say warmly, "Feel free to let your child sleep here! We will take care of him." Sometimes, seeing that it was getting late and the mother had not yet arrived, they would call and tell her not to bother picking up the child, or they would take the initiative to send the child home and then pick him up in the morning to bring him to the kindergarten. The mothers, seeing how the aunts cared for them and their children, entrusted their children to the aunts with great peace of mind.

　　The aunts truly loved the children like mothers.

　　Jin Zhongxin's clothes used to always be clean, but now they were often dirty and not changed, and his cotton pants had a teacup-sized hole worn through them on the slide, and his mother hadn't mended them for days. Aunt Shen Peili began to find it strange. To get to the bottom of things, she made a home visit one evening. She didn't see Jin Zhongxin's mother, but the neighbor, Aunt Wang, told her, "Zhongxin's mother is making steel at the factory right now and is very busy. She's also not feeling well. The aunties will have to take extra care of the child." So that was the situation! After returning, Shen Peili resolutely took on the responsibilities of Jin Zhongxin's mother, washing Jin Zhongxin's clothes, mending his socks, washing his hair...

　　Yang Wenduo got the measles, and Wenduo's mother rushed over and cried when she saw her child with a high fever; she was also worried. Because the kindergarten didn't have an isolation room at that time, the child couldn't stay in the kindergarten; if she took him home, she wouldn't be able to manage since she worked at the bank and was busy, and there would be no one to take care of the child. As she was struggling, Aunt Zhang Chengying comforted her, saying, "Don't worry, you can go to work with peace of mind. Let me take the child home, and I'll take care of him."

　　Three days later, Yang Wenduo's father, Yang Jingji, rushed to Aunt Zhang's house early in the morning to see his son. He was stunned by the scene before him as soon as he entered the door: the quilt on the bed was dirty from Wenduo and thrown on the floor, and Aunt Zhang was wearing her clothes and holding Wenduo, spoon-feeding him medicine. Yang Jingji's eyes blurred. He said with a trembling voice:
　　"Aunt Zhang, how can we ever repay you? Let me take the child back!"
　　Aunt Zhang asked in surprise: "Take him back to whom?"
　　"My wife and I will take turns taking leave."
　　"That won't do. Getting the measles isn't something that will be cured in a day or two. Taking leave will take at least a few days, and won't that affect production? If you trust me, just leave Wenduo here. If the bedding gets dirty, we can just wash it."

　　Yang Jingji used to rush to pick up his child as soon as he got off work, and didn't care about anything else; now, after entrusting his child to someone he completely trusted, he could actively engage in production and study with peace of mind.

　　Worker Yin Zhaojun's son, Yin Guozhong, was one and a half years old and still couldn't stand steadily, and weighed only twenty catties. After coming to the kindergarten, he was able to stand steadily when he was taken back home on the first Sunday, he was able to walk a few steps when he was taken back on the second Sunday, and his little face began to plump up when he was taken back on the third Sunday. After two months, his weight increased to twenty-seven catties.

　　As soon as Yin Guozhong arrived at the kindergarten, the old director, Shen Ziyuan, said to Aunt Tao, "Whether a child is healthy and adorable is the aunt's responsibility. Yin Guozhong's mother has to spend three hours commuting to and from work every day. How can she take care of the child all day like we can? Now we have to rely on us." Aunt Tao was very moved by these words and was determined to take good care of the child. After careful observation, she found that Guozhong's stool was both white and thin, indicating indigestion and insufficient nutrition, so she adopted the method of eating small meals frequently. While the other children ate five meals a day, Guozhong ate seven meals, and she specially cooked pork liver porridge, minced meat porridge, vegetable porridge, milk porridge, and sugar porridge for him, and also often took him out to bask in the sun. With such meticulous care, how could Yin Guozhong not change every day?

　　Special mention should be made of Director Shen Ziyuan. She is not only the mother of her own six children, but also the mother of the kindergarten's one hundred and seventy children. She comes early in the morning and goes back very late in the evening, and she dreams about the children at night. As soon as it's windy or rainy, she wakes up in alarm and hurriedly gets out of bed, puts on her clothes, and rushes from home to the kindergarten to check...

　　The aunts in the kindergarten used to be housewives with low levels of education and were completely unfamiliar with singing, dancing, playing the piano, and painting; but they had a red heart. For the sake of the children, they were determined to learn these things. The old director, who was forty years old, had stiff hands when she played the piano, and they didn't obey her commands, so she went home to ask her sons and daughters for advice, asking them to sing to her and teach her over and over again, and finally learned it.

　　When Aunt Chen Xiafei taught music class to the children for the first time, her face turned red to her neck before she even sang a word, and her heart jumped before her hands and feet moved when she danced. So every night after returning home, she invited the younger brothers and sisters from her neighborhood who knew how to dance and loved to sing to her home to teach her. After studying for more than a month, she finally grasped some basics. Telling stories to the children, one had to express various different expressions and tones for different characters and animals, which was not easy, so she practiced telling stories in front of the mirror by herself.

　　After hard study and practice, the aunts not only learned but also mastered these skills. All nine caregivers in the class can play, dance, sing, tell stories, paint, and even compose. They create their own teaching plans and have composed hundreds of children's songs, puppet shows, and dance tunes and scripts for the children, and have also made hundreds of toys themselves. Among them, some things closely related to the central movement and reflecting real life, not to mention the children love to listen to, even adults love to listen to, many children's education workers have gone to listen to the lectures of these housewives, and couldn't stop praising them.

　　Diligent gardeners have cultivated beautiful flowers. The kindergarten children are growing up lively and healthy, becoming towering talents and bearing fruitful results!

     好阿姨，好妈妈！
     曾子坚　徐传楙
    上海五四二厂的幼儿园本来是日托。每天，妈妈们把自己心爱的小宝宝送到幼儿园来以后，安安心心去上工，可一到晚上，就得急急忙忙地来接孩子。有些妈妈，不得不因此放弃了晚上的政治学习，或一些有意义的活动集会。看到这种情景，幼儿园的阿姨们心里不安起来。她们想：自己丢开家里的事出来做保育工作，就是为了让妈妈们能安心生产。照现在这样，妈妈还是不能省心啊！该怎么办呢？还是自己辛苦一些吧，因此她们提出临时半夜托，临时全夜托等办法。妈妈来晚了，她们总是热心地说：“放心让孩子睡在这里吧！我们会照看他的。”有时看看天色晚了，妈妈还没有来，就打电话去叫别来接了，或者主动把孩子送回家，早上又去接孩子来园。母亲们见阿姨对自己、对孩子这样关心，都很放心地把孩子交给了阿姨。
    阿姨们真像妈妈一样抚爱孩子。
    金忠信这孩子的衣服过去总是穿得干干净净的，可现在却常常很脏了也不换，棉裤在滑梯上磨破了茶杯口大一个洞，几天也没见妈妈给他补上。阿姨沈佩丽开始感到奇怪了。为了把事情弄清楚，她抽晚上去做了一次家庭访问。金忠信的妈没见着，可邻居王阿婶却对她说：“忠信妈厂里现在正炼钢，忙得很，她自己身体又不太好，孩子可要阿姨多照看些。”原来是这么回事啊！沈佩丽回去后就毅然担负起了金忠信母亲的职责，给金忠信洗衣服，补袜子，洗头发……。
    杨文铎出痧子了，文铎的妈妈赶来看到发高烧的孩子直流泪；同时也着急。因为幼儿园里那时没有隔离室，孩子不能留在园里；带回家吧，自己在银行里工作忙不开，孩子无人照看。她正在为难，张成英阿姨却安慰她说：“别着急，你安心工作好了。孩子让我带回家去，我来护理他。”
    三天以后，杨文铎的爸爸杨景吉一大早赶来张阿姨家看儿子，他刚进门就被眼前的情景怔住了：床上的被子给文铎弄得很脏丢在地上，张阿姨披着衣服，正抱着文铎一调匙一调匙喂他吃药水。杨景吉眼睛模糊了。他带着颤音说：
      “张阿姨，这怎么对得起你，还是让我把孩子领回去吧！”
    张阿姨惊奇地问道：“领回去给谁带呀！”
    “我和爱人轮流请假。”
    “那怎么行，出痧子可不是一、二天就好的，一请假起码得几天，这不影响生产吗？你要是放心的话，就把文铎留在这里好了，被褥脏了洗一洗就是。”
    杨景吉过去一下班就忙着去接孩子，别的什么事都顾不上；现在，当他把孩子交给了他完全信托的人之后，他能积极生产安心学习了。
    工人尹兆钧的儿子尹国忠，一岁半了还站不稳，体重只有二十斤。来到了园里后，第一个礼拜天领回去时，站得稳了，第二个礼拜天领回去时，能走几步路了，第三个礼拜天领回去时，小脸蛋开始胖起来，过了二个月，体重增加到二十七斤。
    尹国忠一到园里，老所长沈子缘就对陶阿姨说：“孩子是不是健康可爱，这是阿姨的事。尹国忠妈妈每天上下班单路上来回就得花上三个钟点，她哪能像我们一样，整天照看孩子，现在就得靠我们了。”陶阿姨听了这话心里很感动，下决心要带好这孩子。她仔细观察后，发现国忠的大便既白又稀，知道是消化不良，营养不足，就采取少吃多餐的办法。其他的孩子每天吃五餐，国忠就吃七餐，还特地为他煮了猪肝粥、肉沫粥、菜沫粥、牛奶粥、糖粥等，并且还经常抱他出去晒太阳。这样细心地护理，尹国忠怎么不会天天变呢？
    特别应该提到的是所长沈子缘。她不光是自己六个孩子的妈妈，也是幼儿园的一百七十个孩子的妈妈。她早上很早来，晚上很晚回去，夜里做梦也在想着孩子们。只要一刮风下雨，她就会惊醒过来，赶忙起床披了衣服从家里奔往幼儿园去查看。……
    幼儿园里的阿姨们过去都是家庭妇女，文化程度很低，对于唱歌，跳舞，弹琴，画画等也完全不熟悉；可是她们却有一颗红心。为了孩子们，她们一心要把这些学会。老所长四十岁的人了，弹起琴来两只手硬硬的，不听使唤，于是她回家去就向儿子女儿请教，叫孩子们一遍又一遍地唱给她听，教她，终于学会了。
    陈霞斐阿姨第一次给孩子们教音乐课，歌未唱出口，脸先红到脖子上，跳舞手脚未动心先跳。于是她每晚回家后，就请邻居会跳舞爱唱歌的小弟弟小妹妹到她家来教她，学了一个多月，才算摸到了一些门路。给孩子们讲故事，一人要表现出各种人物动物不同的表情和声调，也不容易，因此她就一个人对着镜子试讲。
    经过苦学苦练，阿姨们不仅学会了，而且学精了。带班的九个教养员人人都会弹、会跳、会唱、会讲、会画、甚至会编。她们自编教学计划，给孩子们编制了几百首儿歌、木偶戏、舞蹈等曲调和剧本，还自制玩具几百件。其中一些密切结合中心运动和反映现实生活的东西，不要说孩子们喜爱听，就是大人也爱听，曾经有许多儿童教育工作者去听了这些家庭妇女的讲课后，都不住嘴地连声赞美。
    辛勤的园丁培育出了美丽的花朵。幼儿园的孩子们活泼健康地成长着，成为擎天之材，结出丰硕之果！
