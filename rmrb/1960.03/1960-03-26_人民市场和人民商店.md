To eliminate speculation and profiteering by illegal merchants, stabilize people's lives, and promote economic development in urban and rural areas, the Cuban revolutionary government has established people's markets and people's stores in cities and villages.

　　In Havana, five people's markets managed by the municipal government have already been organized. The National Land Reform Committee has also set up shops in the markets. These shops purchase products directly from farmers at reasonable prices and then supply urban residents with necessities at reasonable prices, thus avoiding the exploitation of middlemen. For example, in the past, one peso could only buy twenty bananas, but now in the stores of the people's market, the same amount of money can buy 60% more bananas.

　　With the realization of land reform, 1,300 people's stores have also been established in rural areas. In the past, farmers suffered from the heavy exploitation of merchants, who bought cheap and sold dear to farmers. Profits were generally as high as 40%.

　　Now, the National Land Reform Committee, through the people's stores, on the one hand, purchases from farmers at favorable prices, and on the other hand, only charges a 10% profit on the goods sold to them to compensate for transportation and management personnel expenses.

　　According to the director of the Production and Foreign Trade Department of the National Land Reform Committee, the people's stores will become the main institutions for stabilizing agricultural production and providing funds for agricultural production, and also a base for distributing seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools, as well as disseminating planting techniques among farmers.

    人民市场和人民商店
    为了肃清不法商人投机倒把、攫取暴利的行为，稳定人民的生活，促进城乡经济发展，古巴革命政府在城市和乡村建立了人民市场和人民商店。
    在哈瓦那，已经组织了五个由市政府管理的人民市场。土地改革全国委员会也在市场里设立了商店。这些商店以合理的价格直接向农民购买产品，再以合理的价钱供应城市居民的必需品，这样就避免了中间商人的剥削。例如，过去一比索只能买二十只香蕉，而现在在人民市场的商店里，同样多的钱可以多买60％的香蕉。
    随着土地改革的实现，在农村也建立了一千三百个人民商店。过去农民受着商人的苛重剥削，商人向农民贱买贵卖。利润一般高达40％。
    现在土地改革全国委员会通过人民商店一方面以有利的价钱向农民收购，另方面向他们卖出的商品只收10％的利润用来补偿运输和管理人员的费用。
    据土地改革全国委员会生产和对外贸易部主任说，人民商店将成为稳定农业生产和向农业生产提供资金的主要机构，同时也是分配种子、肥料、农具以及在农民中传播种植技术的基地。（附图片）
