Robber's Crime Ironclad Evidence
The Caisson of Zhihua Temple in Beijing

    In the decades before liberation, American imperialists, under the guise of "cultural exchange," dispatched many cultural spies with different titles and identities. They openly or secretly penetrated various parts of our country to investigate and collect ancient cultural relics and treasures. They even dismantled and transported famous ancient architectural relics or decorative remnants from our country. The caisson of Zhihua Temple in Beijing is the most obvious example. Zhihua Temple is located in Lumicang, Dongcheng, Beijing. It is a large-scale temple built in the eighth year of the Zhengtong reign of the Ming Dynasty. The caisson on the ceiling of the main room in the Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas in the temple is exquisitely carved in wood, even larger and more beautiful in structure than the caisson in the Nanxun Hall of the Forbidden City. The center of the caisson is in the "Douba" style, and the square frame on all four sides is one zhang two or three chi (about twenty square meters). The square frame is divided into octagons with supports, and the inner octagon is formed by two square grids. The eight sloping slabs extending upwards support the central circle. The edges of the square grids are carved with scrolls, lotus petals, and arched brackets. The gaps are carved with the Eight Treasures. A vigorous and sturdy coiled dragon, with its head hanging down, is wrapped around the central circle. This architectural creation is ingenious in its workmanship and elegant in its form. It is a masterpiece of Ming Dynasty architectural wood carving art. Before 1931, this artistic masterpiece, made with much effort by the working people, was stolen by American robbers, leaving the beams and frames empty. Now this caisson is placed in the Nelson Museum in the United States, together with the wall paintings of Guangsheng Temple in Zhaocheng, Shanxi. This is the real evidence of the American robbers' acts of plunder.

    强盗罪行铁证如山
    北京智化寺的藻井
    解放前数十年间，美帝国主义者就曾打着“交流文化”的招牌，派遣过很多不同名义身份的文化特务，公开或秘密地深入我国各地，调查搜罗我国古代文物珍品，甚至拆运我国著名的古代建筑遗迹或装饰遗物，如北京智化寺的藻井，就是其中最显明的例子。智化寺在北京东城禄米仓，是明代正统八年建筑的一座规模宏大的寺宇。寺中万佛阁室内明间天花藻井，木雕刻非常精致，比起故宫南熏殿的藻井结构还大，还美丽。藻井中央是“斗八”式，四边方框见方有一丈二三尺（约二十平方米）。方框内用支条区划成八角形，又用两方格套和成内八角。向上斜出的八面平板托起当中的圆心，方格边缘雕刻卷云、莲瓣、栱枓等。空档内雕刻八宝。中央圆心蟠绕着一条矫健粗壮的团龙，垂首向下。这个建筑制作工巧，形式秀丽，是明代建筑木雕艺术的精品。在1931年以前，这个经过劳动人民费了很多心血制成的艺术杰作，就被美国强盗偷走，剩下梁架空空。现在这个藻井被放在美国奈尔逊博物馆内，和山西赵城广胜寺壁画等在一起。这是美国强盗们劫掠行为的真赃实证。
