Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 4th. The Soviet "Pravda" published a commentator's article today, attacking the actions of the North Atlantic Group and West Germany in preparing to turn Denmark and Norway into their military bases.

The commentary said that the broad movement of the people striving for disarmament has encountered the stubborn resistance of the supporters of the "Cold War." The militarist groups of the leading Western countries continue to lead some countries down the path of further militarization, as a response to public demands for the prevention of a new war. It is regrettable that military and political figures in some countries that have suffered major war disasters and destruction are also listening to the instigators of war. The commentary cited as examples Denmark and Norway, which are undergoing new military preparations, with Denmark also preparing new military bills.

The commentary said that recently, the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization leadership group in exerting pressure on Denmark and Norway have attracted people's attention. Obviously, they want to turn the territory of these two countries into military bases for the North Atlantic Group.

The commentary said that West German revanchists are paying special attention to Denmark and Norway, and these revanchists already have territorial claims on neighboring countries. Bonn is using its growing influence in the North Atlantic Group to try to strengthen its position in some parts of Europe, especially Northern Europe. West German Defense Minister Strauss, under the pretext of establishing warehouses for the North Atlantic Group, is trying to establish military bases in these countries, in order to drive them to participate in military adventures when the time is right. It should be admitted that Bonn has forced some countries in the North Atlantic Group, including Denmark and Norway, to make concessions.

The commentary said that as a friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union has warned Denmark and Norway more than once that they must be vigilant against West German militarism and not forget the old nature of West German militarism. The establishment of a military warehouse system by Bonn in these two countries, and the appearance of West German officers in the North Atlantic Group headquarters, are real threats to Denmark and Norway.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd. The Soviet "Red Star" published an article today, attacking a large-scale joint military exercise held by the United States and West Germany not long ago, saying that this exercise was an adventurous action in preparation for aggression. The U.S. Seventh Army was the main participant in this exercise, which shows that the exercise was controlled by the will of the United States.

The article continued, even the U.S. "New York Times" admitted that this exercise was a review of the atomic preparedness of the North Atlantic Group's army.

The "Red Star" article pointed out three characteristics of this exercise: First, it made extensive use of so-called "long-range action reconnaissance teams." These reconnaissance teams consisted of four to six people equipped with radio equipment. In addition, there were plainclothes squads. This shows that this reconnaissance team is preparing to penetrate deep into the rear of the opposing side; second, it widely used "exercise nuclear weapons"; third, it used a large number of helicopters to drop "reconnaissance teams" and "combat teams."

In discussing the U.S.'s active support for West German militarism, the article pointed out that the U.S. aggressive forces place great hope on Bonn's revanchists. They regard these revanchists as their reliable pillar, and are doing everything they can to strengthen it. West German militarists are also cunningly using the protection and help of the North Atlantic Group to build their own large army equipped with modern weapons. The article further pointed out that, according to Bonn's own admission, West Germany not only wants to arm itself, but also wants to establish its own military base network on the territory of some participating countries of the North Atlantic Group and on the territory of Spain. The article finally pointed out that the imperialist group is thus using dangerous arms race adventures to oppose the peace-loving people.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 4th. The Polish "People's Tribune" published a commentary today entitled "Fierce Cold War Actions," attacking the "Cold War" clamor of American generals. The commentary pointed out that the proposal of U.S. General Norstad, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the North Atlantic Group in Europe, to establish a "multinational mobile special force" for the North Atlantic Group next year is a kind of Cold War proposal. This force will initially be composed of the United States, Britain, and France. Norstad has strongly stated at a press conference that other countries can also participate in the future. This action is an attempt to supply a large number of destructive weapons to the participants of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Obviously, Norstad first wants to supply nuclear weapons to the West German armed forces.

The commentary reminded that this type of "initiative" was put forward two weeks before the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference and two months before the summit meeting.

The commentary pointed out that certain groups in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and certain powerful groups in Western countries are eagerly hoping to create a situation in which the West German government's "Cold War" means will be more effective and hinder the possibility of reaching certain agreements and continuing to ease the situation.

    苏联“真理报”“红星报”、波兰“人民论坛报”发表评论揭露
    北大西洋集团正在加紧“冷战”活动
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表一篇观察家评论，抨击北大西洋集团和西德准备把丹麦和挪威变成它们的军事基地的行动。
    评论说，人民争取裁军的广泛运动遇到了
  “冷战”拥护者的顽强抵抗。西方首要国家的军国主义集团继续把一些国家引向进一步军国主义化的道路，作为对公众关于防止新战争要求的一种回答。值得引为遗憾的是，在一些受过战争重大灾难和破坏的国家里的军政界人物也听从战争挑拨者的支配。评论举例说，丹麦和挪威就正在进行新的军事准备，丹麦还在准备新的军事法案。
    评论说，最近以来，北大西洋公约组织领导集团对丹麦和挪威施加压力的行动引起人们的注意。很显然，他们是想把这两个国家的领土变成北大西洋集团的军事基地。
    评论说，西德复仇主义者对丹麦和挪威特别注意，这些复仇主义者已经对邻国有领土要求。波恩运用自己在北大西洋集团中的日益增长的影响，企图加强自己在欧洲某些地区，特别是北欧地区的阵地。西德国防部长施特劳斯以建立北大西洋集团的仓库为借口，企图在这些国家建立军事基地，以便在适当时机驱使它们参加军事冒险。应该承认，波恩已经迫使包括丹麦和挪威在内的北大西洋集团的一些国家作出让步。
    评论说，作为友好邻国，苏联已不止一次警告丹麦和挪威必须警惕地对待西德军国主义，不要忘记西德军国主义的旧性。波恩在这两个国家中建立军事仓库体系以及西德军官出现在北大西洋集团参谋部之中，这些都是对于丹麦和挪威的现实威胁。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联“红星报”今天发表文章抨击美国和西德军队不久前联合举行的一次大规模的军事演习说，这次演习是为了准备侵略的一种冒险行动。美国第七军是这次演习的主要参加者，这说明这次演习是由美国的意志所控制的。
    文章接着说，连美国“纽约时报”也承认这一次演习是对北大西洋集团军队的原子备战的检阅。
      “红星报”的文章指出了这次演习的三个特点：第一、它大量利用了所谓“远方行动侦察队”。这种侦察队由四至六个带有无线电装备的人员组成。此外，还有便衣小队。这表明这种侦察队是准备用来深入到作战对方的后方的；第二、它广泛采用了“演习用的核武器”；第三、它采用了大批直升飞机来投掷“侦察队”和“战斗队”。
    文章在谈到美国积极扶植西德军国主义时指出，美国侵略势力对波恩的复仇主义者寄予很大的希望。他们把这些复仇主义者看成是自己可靠的支柱，并用全力来加强它。而西德军国主义者也正在狡猾地利用北大西洋集团的庇护和帮助来建立自己大批由现代化武器装备起来的军队。文章进一步指出，根据波恩政府自己承认，西德不仅要武装起来，而且要在北大西洋集团某些参加国的领土上以及在西班牙领土上建立起自己的军事基地网。文章最后指出，帝国主义集团就是这样用危险的备战的冒险行动来反对爱好和平人民的。
    新华社华沙4日电　波兰“人民论坛报”今天以“猛烈的冷战行动”为题发表评论，抨击美国将军的“冷战”叫嚣。评论指出，美国将军、北大西洋集团驻欧武装部队总司令诺斯塔德的关于在明年建立北大西洋集团“多国家的机动特别部队”的倡议，就是一种冷战的倡议。这支部队最初将由美、英、法三国组成。诺斯塔德在记者招待会上已经强烈表示，将来其他国家也可以参加。这种行动是企图把大量毁灭性的武器供给北大西洋公约组织的参加者。很明显，诺斯塔德首先是想把核武器供给西德的武装力量。
    评论提醒说，这种性质的“倡议”是在日内瓦十国裁军会议举行前两周和最高级会议举行前两个多月的时候提出的。
    评论指出，北大西洋公约组织某些集团和西方国家的某些有势力的集团，热烈地希望造成这样的局势，就是使西德政府的“冷战”手段更加有成效，并阻挠达成某些协议和继续缓和局势的可能性。
