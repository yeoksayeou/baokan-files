    Shaking off Household Labor and Striding Forward
    Minority Women Become a Production Force
    (Reported by this newspaper) For thousands of years, the minority women of our country, who have suffered national and class oppression, have finally raised their eyebrows and stepped forward in the great Mao Zedong era. They are using their diligent and brave hands to make great contributions to socialist construction and the prosperity and development of their ethnic groups.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the vast majority of minority women, like Han women, have been freed from tedious household chores and have entered the vast world of social labor. In the past two years, the ranks of minority women workers have grown rapidly. According to statistics from Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia and other autonomous regions, the number of female workers of all ethnic groups has developed to more than 170,000, becoming a prominent force in the development of industry in ethnic regions. In Inner Mongolia, women of all ethnic groups built more than 800 "March 8th" women's blast furnaces during the Great Steel Smelting Campaign, and they produced pig iron from their own hands for the first time. A large number of herder women have entered factories and learned new technologies such as dairy production and leather making. The Karamay "March 8th" drilling team, composed of thirty-two women from various ethnic groups, were all housewives two years ago. In just four months, the team drilled twenty-two wells and continuously exceeded the record of drilling over 1,000 meters per month. In agricultural and pastoral production, minority women are an even more powerful force. Most minority women used to undertake some of the main labor in agricultural and pastoral production. Now, they have become an important force in the struggle to transform nature, such as building water conservancy projects, planting trees and forests, conserving water and soil, and improving soil. Women in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region now undertake more than half of the farm work. In the past, women in pastoral areas of Xinjiang only did labor such as lambing, raising lambs, shearing wool, and milking. Now, their scope of labor has expanded to treating livestock diseases, artificial insemination, grazing, and repairing and padding sheds.
    In Guizhou, thousands of minority women have become rice-transplanting experts. Yang Jiao, a Shui girl from the Shuolong People's Commune in Sandu Shui Autonomous County, transplanted 54,000 seedlings a day with a rice transplanter and was named a rice-transplanting model worker.
    Inspired by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, minority women have broken through many superstitious fallacies and outdated customs in participating in social labor, and put forward the bold statement that "what men can do, women can do too." Yu Ai Yang, a Dai girl from Yunnan, was the first to break the Dai superstition that "women plow the fields, and there will be drought for three years." Soon, more than 400 Dai women plowing experts appeared. The Hui women of Ningxia resolutely shattered the shackles of the religious feudal system. In the past, "inner women could not see outer men," but now more than 90% of Hui women have stepped into the ranks of production and construction.
    After participating in social labor, the vast number of minority women, under the education of the Party, have rapidly improved their socialist and communist consciousness, and they have a high sense of responsibility for the collective cause. Zalin Tajikbay, a woman from the Tajik Autonomous County of Taxkorgan, Xinjiang, took the initiative to mobilize sixteen women after the male commune members went up the mountain to smelt iron. They walked for a day and a night to rescue all 350 sheep trapped on the snowy mountain, so that the commune's property was not lost. During the construction of a reservoir in Tongxin County, Ningxia, Ma Baoying, a Hui woman, led more than 300 Hui women in a special-class model company to undertake the frontline task of damming the reservoir. After the dam was built, a gap was suddenly broken through. Ma Baoying immediately jumped into the water without hesitation and blocked the gap with her body. The heroic images of these figures radiate the brilliance of minority women in the new era.
    After minority women have been thoroughly liberated politically and economically, their social status has been greatly improved. Under the deep concern of the Party, a large number of minority women cadres have grown up rapidly, and many outstanding women have been loved by the masses and elected as "housekeepers" of collective undertakings. In areas where ethnic minorities live in Guangxi, many communes have minority women serving as chairpersons or vice-chairpersons, and every team has minority women serving as captains or deputy captains. Niguo Guoguo, a Yi woman from the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan, was the first person in the entire prefecture to raise the banner of mutual assistance and cooperation. In the people's commune movement, the commune she led was also at the forefront.

    摆脱家务劳动昂首阔步前进
    少数民族妇女成为生产劲旅
    本报讯　千百年来受尽民族压迫和阶级压迫的我国少数民族妇女，在伟大的毛泽东时代里扬眉吐气，昂首阔步前进，她们用自己勤劳勇敢的双手，为社会主义建设和民族的繁荣发展，做出巨大的贡献。
    大跃进以来，少数民族妇女和汉族妇女一样，绝大多数都摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，进入社会劳动的广阔天地。少数民族妇女的工人队伍，这两年中迅速地壮大起来。据内蒙古、新疆、宁夏等自治区的统计，各民族的女职工已经发展到十七万多人，成为发展民族地区工业一支突起的劲旅。内蒙古各族妇女在大炼钢铁运动中，就兴建了八百多个妇女号小高炉，第一次从她们手里炼出了生铁。大批牧民妇女走进工厂，学会了制乳品、制皮革等新技术。由三十二个各族妇女组成的克拉玛依“三八”钻井队，两年前她们都是家庭妇女，仅仅四个月，这个队就钻了二十二口井，并且连续超过月钻千米的纪录。在农牧业生产中，少数民族妇女更是一支强大的生力军。大部分少数民族的妇女，在过去就担负着农牧业生产中的一些主要劳动，现在她们更成了兴修水利、植树造林、水土保持、改良土壤等改造大自然斗争中的重要力量。宁夏回族自治区的妇女，现在已担负了一半以上的农活。新疆牧区妇女过去只是做接羔、育羔、剪毛、挤奶等劳动，现在她们的劳动范围扩大到治疗牲畜疾病、人工配种、放牧和修垫棚圈等方面。
    贵州有成千上万的少数民族妇女变成插秧能手，三都水族自治县水龙公社的水族姑娘杨姣，用插秧机日插五万四千窝，被评为插秧标兵。
    少数民族妇女受到全国大跃进的鼓舞，在参加社会劳动中，冲破了许多迷信邪说和陈规陋俗，提出“男人能干的女人也能干”的豪言壮语。云南傣族姑娘玉艾养第一个打破了傣族中“妇女犁田、天旱三年”的迷信，很快就出现了四百多个傣族妇女犁田能手。宁夏的回族妇女们，坚决粉碎了宗教封建制度的束缚，过去那里是“内女不能见外男”，现在90％以上的回族妇女跨进生产建设的行列。
    广大少数民族妇女参加社会劳动以后，在党的教育下，社会主义和共产主义觉悟迅速提高，她们对集体事业具有高度的责任感。新疆塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县的妇女扎林塔吉克拜，在男社员们上山炼铁以后，她主动动员了十六名妇女，步行一个昼夜，把困在雪山那边的三百五十只羊全部救出，使公社的财产没有受到损失。宁夏同心县的回族妇女马保英，在兴修水库时，率领三百多名由回族妇女组成的特等模范连，担负水库截流最前哨的任务。大坝筑起以后，突然被冲破了一个缺口，马保英马上奋不顾身地跳进水里，用身体挡住了缺口。这些人物的英雄形象，放射着新时代里少数民族妇女的光辉。
    少数民族妇女在政治上和经济上得到彻底翻身以后，社会地位有了很大的提高。在党的深切关怀下，大量的少数民族妇女干部迅速成长起来，许多优秀的妇女受到群众爱戴，被推选为集体事业的“管家人”。广西的少数民族聚居的地区，许多公社都有少数民族妇女担任社长或副社长，队队都有少数民族妇女担任正或副队长。四川凉山彝族自治州的彝族妇女尼古果果，便是全州第一个举起互助合作大旗的人，在人民公社化运动中，她领导的公社也是走在最前列。
