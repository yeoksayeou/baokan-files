    Concentrating Efforts on Large-Scale Afforestation and Developing Diversified Operations
    Huguan County Communes Establish Joint Forest Farms
    (Our Newspaper) News item: The Five Dragon Mountain Forest Farm, jointly operated by the Chengguan, Jinzhuang, Zhoucun, and Dianshang Communes in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, was established in November of last year. Although the forest farm has not been established for long, people say it is being run well.
    The forest farm covers an area of over 112,200 mu. The four communes have established a professional team of more than 400 people here, who are permanently stationed to manage forestry. They have already planted some timber forests, economic forests, and scenic forests.
    The Five Dragon Mountain Joint Forest Farm is a product of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes. In the past, the forest cover on Five Dragon Mountain was sparse, and soil erosion was serious, but individual advanced cooperatives did not have the strength to establish a forest farm here. After communization, the county party committee put forward the call to "Advance on Five Dragon Mountain." After research by the party committees of the four communes of Chengguan, Jinzhuang, Zhoucun, and Dianshang, they established the joint forest farm.
    After the establishment of the forest farm, the secretaries at all levels of the communes took the lead, relied on the masses, and formulated a forestry construction plan for Five Dragon Mountain. They also publicized the bright prospects of Five Dragon Mountain to the masses. The four communes mobilized more than 13,000 people to wage a great battle on Five Dragon Mountain, afforesting more than 45,000 mu in seven days, completing 40% of the plan. In order to closely integrate mass movements with the perennial operation and management of the professional team, the forest farm established a professional team of more than 400 people. In addition to managing and protecting the planted saplings, they have blasted rocks, removed rocks and replaced soil in 60,000 holes, and renovated 1,300 mu of forest land, collected 45,000 jin of tree seeds, and cultivated 70 mu of nurseries, all in preparation for large-scale afforestation in the spring. Over the past few months, in operating the forest farm, they have conscientiously implemented the principle of focusing on forestry, developing diversified operations, using sideline production to support the main production, and using short-term gains to support long-term development, as well as the principle of running the farm diligently and thriftily. In addition to achieving great accomplishments in forestry construction, they have also established pig farms, chicken farms, and bee farms.

    集中力量大量造林发展多种经营
    壶关县各公社办联合林场
    本报讯　山西省壶关县城关、晋庄、周村、店上等四个公社联合经营的五龙山林场，是在去年11月建立起来的。建场的时间虽然不长，但人们都说这个林场办得好。
    这个林场的面积有十一万两千二百多亩，四个公社在这里建立了一支四百多人的专业队，常年固定下来经营林业。现在已经造了一部分用材林、经济林和风景林。
    五龙山联合林场是大跃进和人民公社的产物。过去五龙山上森林复盖稀薄，水土流失严重，但是高级社时期没有力量在这里办个林场。公社化后县委提出：“向五龙山进军”的号召后，城关、晋庄、周村、店上四个公社的党委一研究，就把联合林场办起来了。
    林场建立之后，各公社层层书记挂帅，依靠群众，制订出了五龙山林业建设规划，并向群众宣传了五龙山的美好前景。四个公社出动了一万三千多人，大战五龙山，七天造林四万五千多亩，完成规划的40％。为了使群众运动和专业队伍常年经营管理密切结合起来，林场建立起了四百多人的专业队伍，除管理保护好已造幼林外，从去年冬季到现在共爆破石方、起石换土六万穴，整修林地一千三百亩，采集树种四万五千斤，培育苗圃七十亩，为春季大规模造林作好准备工作。几个月来，他们在经营林场中，认真贯彻执行以林为主、多种经营，以副养主，以短养长的方针和勤俭办场的原则，他们除了在林业建设上取得了巨大成就之外，并且建立了猪场、鸡场和蜂场。
