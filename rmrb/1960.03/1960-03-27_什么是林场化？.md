    What is forest farm development?
    Forest farm development is the establishment of forest farms in existing forest areas and new forest areas to carry out year-round management and operations, ensuring that wherever there is forest (possessing a certain area), there is a farm. On barren hills and wastelands suitable for forestry development, forest farms should also be established according to needs and possibilities to carry out afforestation work.
    Forest farm development is the central link of the "three transformations" of forestry (base development of forestry production, forest farm development of forestry management, and high-yield cultivation of trees). With forest farms, various forestry bases can be established according to national needs; afforestation and year-round forest management can be carried out according to certain standards to achieve high-yield cultivation of trees. In other words, with forest farms, there is an organizational guarantee for realizing the "three transformations" of forestry, and the entire forestry work has a foothold. Realizing forest farm development is an important step in the transition of forestry production from extensive management to intensive management and modern production.
    To realize forest farm development, it is necessary to implement the policy of "walking on two legs," that is, strengthening the construction of state-owned forest farms and commune-run forest farms. People's communes with certain afforestation and forest management tasks should quickly establish forest farms. At the same time, new state-owned forest farms should be established in a planned way.

### 什么是林场化？

    什么是林场化？
    林场化就是在现有林区和新林区建立起林场，进行常年的经营管理，做到有林（具有一定面积）就有场。在适于发展林业的荒山荒地上，也根据需要与可能建立林场，开展造林工作。
    林场化是林业“三化”（林业生产基地化、林业经营林场化、林木培育丰产化）的中心环节。有了林场，才能按照国家需要，建立起各种林业基地；才能按照一定的规格来造林和常年营林，实现林木培育丰产化。也就是说，有了林场，实现林业“三化”才有组织保证，整个林业工作才有落脚点。实现林场化是林业生产由粗放经营走向集约经营和现代化生产的一个重要步骤。
    要实现林场化，必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针，即加强国营林场与社办林场的建设工作。凡是有一定造林、营林任务的人民公社都应迅速办起林场。同时还要有计划地建立新的国营林场。
