　　Sincere Cooperation is the Key to Smoothly Resolving the Overseas Chinese Issue

　　Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi replied on March 15th to the second letter from Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, suggesting that on the basis of the six demands made by Ambassador Huang Zhen on behalf of the Chinese government to the Indonesian government, both parties should reach an agreement on repatriating Overseas Chinese to China through consultation as soon as possible, so as to create favorable conditions for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue. This is a positive suggestion. The Chinese people fully support this suggestion made by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on behalf of our government.

　　We are pleased to see that a good start has been made towards a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue. The Chinese and Indonesian governments exchanged instruments of ratification of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality on January 20th in Beijing, and a joint committee on the implementation of the treaty was established on January 25th in Jakarta. Negotiations between the two countries on the repatriation of Overseas Chinese to China are also underway, and the first group of Overseas Chinese transported by ships sent by our government has returned to the motherland. Now, our government has once again made constructive efforts, which fully demonstrates the sincerity of our government in seeking a reasonable resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue and safeguarding the friendship between China and Indonesia. We hope that the Indonesian government can also work together with our government in a spirit of friendly cooperation to strive for an agreement on the issue of repatriating Overseas Chinese to China first, so as to continue to remove obstacles and achieve a fair and reasonable solution to the Overseas Chinese issue as soon as possible.

　　Our government has always attached importance to the friendship between China and Indonesia, and has always adopted a positive attitude towards resolving the Overseas Chinese issue, hoping that the resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue will not only conform to the interests of the Overseas Chinese themselves, but also conform to the interests of Indonesia. No one can deny that Overseas Chinese have a positive role in the economic development of Indonesia. Foreign Minister Subandrio also emphasized in the joint communique issued with Foreign Minister Chen Yi last year that "the economic strength of the Overseas Chinese will still play a beneficial role in the economic development of Indonesia." Therefore, our government has always advocated resolving the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese reasonably, so that as many Overseas Chinese as possible can choose Indonesian nationality according to the principle of voluntariness and become non-discriminated citizens of Indonesia. As for those Overseas Chinese who are willing to retain Chinese nationality, it is also hoped that they will stay in Indonesia as much as possible under the condition that their legitimate rights and interests are respected and protected, live in harmony with the Indonesian people, and continue to make positive contributions to the development of Indonesia. It is in this spirit that our government signed a treaty with the Indonesian government in 1955 on the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese, which was a major effort made by our government to fundamentally resolve the Overseas Chinese issue.

　　However, just four years after the signing of this treaty, large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities occurred in Indonesia. Certain influential forces in Indonesia have repeatedly emphasized that Overseas Chinese are no longer compatible with Indonesia's economic development and have excluded them from participating in legitimate economic life, thereby causing a considerable number of Overseas Chinese to lose their livelihoods and fall into displacement. Even under such circumstances, our government still attached importance to the friendship between the two countries and put forward three suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue: requesting the Indonesian government to exchange instruments of ratification of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese with our government as soon as possible, so that the treaty can take effect and be implemented as soon as possible; requesting the Indonesian government to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of those Overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality or choose Indonesian nationality but have not been approved; and emphasizing that the Chinese government is prepared to arrange for those Overseas Chinese who cannot make a living or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia to return to China for production based on their willingness, hoping that the Indonesian government can be responsible for repatriating these Overseas Chinese back to China in batches. The Chinese government took the initiative to propose the issue of repatriating Overseas Chinese to China in its own suggestions, which was not only out of concern for the Overseas Chinese and the needs of its own socialist construction, but also another sincere effort to break the deadlock on the Overseas Chinese issue. In addition to repeatedly requesting the Indonesian government to be responsible for repatriating Overseas Chinese back to China based on their willingness, the Chinese government has also made a series of preparations for receiving and resettling Overseas Chinese returning to China. Under the circumstances that the Indonesian government expressed that it had difficulties in providing ships to transport Overseas Chinese back to China, our government took the initiative to send ships to pick them up for the sake of the friendship between the two countries. All of this fully illustrates the benevolent and righteous attitude adopted by our government in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue.

　　However, these efforts of our government cannot alleviate the responsibility of the Indonesian government in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. First of all, regarding the issue of repatriating Overseas Chinese to China, whether from the perspective of friendly relations between the two countries or from the perspective of international morality, the Indonesian government has an unshirkable responsibility. The Indonesian government has also repeatedly expressed its willingness to assume this responsibility. In his letter to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on December 11th last year, Foreign Minister Subandrio said that the Indonesian government would not obstruct Overseas Chinese who are willing to return to China, and would be prepared to provide assistance to facilitate their return to their motherland. On February 16th this year, Foreign Minister Subandrio also declared to the press: "It is indeed the policy of the (Indonesian) government to provide as much assistance and facilitation as possible to accelerate the repatriation of Overseas Chinese." The Chinese people have every reason to expect the Indonesian government to fulfill its responsibilities and promises. However, it is regrettable that until now, the repatriation of Overseas Chinese has encountered many unnecessary obstacles. Overseas Chinese who request to return to China are subjected to various harassments, their belongings are subjected to harsh restrictions, they are subjected to rude inspections when leaving the country, and their personal belongings are arbitrarily destroyed or detained. To this day, many Overseas Chinese who are eager to return to China are prevented from leaving. The four ships recently sent by our country to pick up Overseas Chinese have arrived in Jakarta, but have not been able to set sail smoothly until now. These actual measures taken by influential groups in Indonesia to deliberately obstruct Overseas Chinese from returning to China are obviously inconsistent with the promises made by the Indonesian government in this regard.

　　As for the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia, we regret to point out that not only have they not been restrained and stopped, but they have shown a trend of intensification. Foreign Minister Subandrio himself admitted after inspecting the situation of Overseas Chinese in West Java last month that the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese "has indeed caused difficulties for Overseas Chinese and made them feel sad." Foreign Minister Subandrio also announced at the beginning of this month that a committee has been formed under his auspices to be responsible for handling the resettlement of Overseas Chinese who have been displaced due to forced relocation. People originally thought that this situation of Overseas Chinese being treated unfairly would soon be changed. But, unfortunately, the facts are not so. The scope of persecution of Overseas Chinese has been further expanded, and the actions of attacking and arresting Overseas Chinese have expanded from rural areas to cities; the means of persecuting Overseas Chinese have also become more brutal, and more and more Overseas Chinese have been forced to lose their fortunes, live without a livelihood, and even the leaders of Overseas Chinese communities have been deported. What is particularly puzzling is that when our government and people are making every effort to adopt a restrained attitude towards the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia in order to create a favorable atmosphere for friendly consultation, some Indonesian newspapers and periodicals continue to carry out endless slanders and attacks against our country, and even some responsible officials have made some irresponsible remarks, slandering our government for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. Can this practice be considered conducive to a reasonable solution of the Overseas Chinese issue and conducive to maintaining the friendship between the two countries?

　　The above-mentioned situation cannot but cause serious anxiety among the vast number of Overseas Chinese. At present, Overseas Chinese in Indonesia cannot stay there with security, nor can they smoothly return to their motherland. How can this not make them feel disheartened? How can it be guaranteed that Overseas Chinese will make truly voluntary choices on the issue of nationality under such circumstances? Moreover, it is reported that the Indonesian authorities have recently made unilateral provisions on the choice of nationality of Overseas Chinese, which are not in line with the spirit of the treaty between the two countries on dual nationality, and can only hinder the smooth implementation of this treaty. If the current anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese trend in Indonesia is allowed to continue to develop, it will inevitably complicate the Overseas Chinese issue and endanger the preliminary results achieved in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue.

　　At present, a large number of Overseas Chinese are asking to return to China. How to quickly and properly arrange for these Overseas Chinese to return to China is the most urgent problem that needs to be solved. Now, Foreign Minister Chen Yi has once again reiterated in his reply letter the six-point proposal made by Ambassador Huang Zhen on behalf of our government regarding the repatriation of Overseas Chinese to China, and stated that if the Indonesian government still has difficulties in providing ships at present, the Chinese government is willing to continue to send ships to pick up Overseas Chinese to return to China, and will notify the Indonesian government of the departure date as soon as possible so that the Indonesian government can make prior arrangements so that the return of Overseas Chinese will not be unnecessarily delayed. These suggestions and statements of our government are completely reasonable. We hope that the two sides can reach an agreement on the issue of repatriating Overseas Chinese to China as soon as possible through consultation, and we hope that the Indonesian government can immediately take measures to eliminate artificial obstacles and improve the situation of Overseas Chinese returning to China. We believe that the smooth resolution of this issue will create a friendly atmosphere for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue.

　　It is already very clear that the key to whether the current Overseas Chinese issue can be resolved smoothly lies in whether both sides have a sincere attitude of cooperation. This is true for the issue of repatriating Overseas Chinese to China, and it is also true for the entire Overseas Chinese issue. Our government has never interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, and will never do so in the future. What kind of policies the Indonesian government adopts in its own country is Indonesia's own business. However, if influential groups in Indonesia use internal affairs as a shield to arbitrarily persecute Overseas Chinese, this is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. Since the issue involves the interests of millions of Overseas Chinese, this is not only a problem for Indonesia alone, but a problem related to both China and Indonesia, and should be resolved by both sides through friendly consultation in a way that is beneficial to both Indonesia and the Overseas Chinese. Our government's position on this issue is firm and unwavering. If the Indonesian government can now take appropriate measures to make more Overseas Chinese willing to choose Indonesian nationality or willing to continue to reside in Indonesia, we of course welcome it, and are willing to cooperate with the Indonesian government to try to persuade Overseas Chinese to make such choices. If the Indonesian government does not welcome Overseas Chinese, or Overseas Chinese do not want to continue to reside there, then we will have to take them back, but this also requires the Indonesian government to provide cooperation in order to achieve it smoothly. Only in this way can it be beneficial to enhancing the friendship between China and Indonesia. In short, whether it is to allow Overseas Chinese to continue to reside there or to let them return to China, both require cooperation from both sides. Without cooperation, things will not be easy; as long as there is cooperation, there is no problem that cannot be solved.

　　China and Indonesia are two friendly countries. We have common enemies, common aspirations to accelerate the construction of our own countries, and both use the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit as the guiding principles for relations between the two countries. What problems are there between us that cannot be resolved? Why should we let such a problem, which can be easily solved, become an obstacle to further strengthening the friendship between our two countries? Allowing the current situation to continue will only benefit imperialism, which is hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia and hopes that Asian and African countries will remain disunited for a long time, and will not benefit the Indonesian people and the Chinese people. It must be seen that the friendship between the people of China and Indonesia is eternal and cannot be destroyed by any force; the recent Overseas Chinese issue between the two countries is only temporary and partial, and can be resolved through efforts. Since a good start has been made towards a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue, then the task before our two countries is for both sides to cooperate sincerely, remove existing obstacles, and promote the smooth resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue. As Foreign Minister Chen Yi said in this reply letter: "We believe that as long as both sides abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, and conduct friendly consultations in earnest, the negotiations between our two countries will progress smoothly, the Overseas Chinese issue can be expected to be resolved comprehensively and reasonably at an early date, and the friendly relations between the two countries will definitely be maintained and developed."

### 真诚合作是顺利解决华侨问题的关键

    真诚合作是顺利解决华侨问题的关键
    我国陈毅外长在3月15日回复了印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长的第二次来信，建议在黄镇大使代表中国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出的六项要求的基础上，双方通过协商，迅速达成一项关于遣送华侨回国的协议，以便为全面解决华侨问题创造有利的条件。这是一个积极的建议。中国人民完全拥护陈毅外长代表我国政府所提出的这个建议。
    我们高兴地看到全面解决华侨问题已经有了良好的开端。中国和印度尼西亚两国政府已于1月20日在北京互换了关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书，并且于1月25日在雅加达成立了有关实施这个条约的联合委员会。两国关于遣送华侨回国的谈判也正在进行，第一批由我国政府派船接运的华侨已经回到了祖国。现在，我国政府又一次作出建设性的努力，这充分表明我国政府谋求合理解决华侨问题和维护中国、印度尼西亚两国友谊的诚意。我们希望印度尼西亚政府也能够本着友好合作的精神，同我国政府共同努力，争取首先就遣送华侨回国的问题达成协议，以便继续排除障碍，使华侨问题早日获得公平合理的解决。
    我国政府向来重视中国和印度尼西亚两国的友谊，对于解决华侨问题一贯采取积极的态度，希望华侨问题的解决既要符合华侨本身的利益，也要符合印度尼西亚的利益。谁都不能否认，华侨对于印度尼西亚的经济发展有着积极的作用。苏班德里约外长去年在同陈毅外长发表的联合公报中也曾强调，“华侨的经济力量将仍然对于印度尼西亚的经济发展起有益作用”。因此，我国政府一直主张通过合理解决华侨的双重国籍问题，使尽可能多的华侨能够根据自愿原则选择印度尼西亚的国籍，成为印度尼西亚的不受歧视的公民。至于那些愿意保留中国国籍的华侨，也希望他们在正当权利和利益受到尊重和保护的情况下尽量留居在印度尼西亚，同印度尼西亚人民友好相处，并且对印度尼西亚的发展继续做出积极的贡献。正是本着这样的精神，我国政府在1955年同印度尼西亚政府签订了关于华侨双重国籍问题的条约，这是我国政府为了从根本上解决华侨问题而作的一次重大努力。
    但是，就在这个条约签订的四年以后，在印度尼西亚出现了大规模的反华排华活动。印度尼西亚某些有影响的势力一再强调华侨同印度尼西亚的经济发展已经不相适应，并且排斥他们参加正当的经济生活，因而使得相当一部分华侨丧失生计，陷于流离失所的境地。即使在这种情况下，我国政府仍然以两国的友谊为重，提出了全面解决华侨问题的三项建议：要求印度尼西亚政府尽快地同我国政府互换关于华侨双重国籍问题条约的批准书，使这一条约早日生效和付诸实施；要求印度尼西亚政府切实保护那些自愿保留中国国籍或者选择印度尼西亚国籍而未获批准的华侨的正当权利和利益；并且着重提出中国政府准备根据那些无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨的志愿，安排他们回国生产，希望印度尼西亚政府能够负责分期分批地遣送这些华侨回国。中国政府在自己的建议中主动地提出遣送华侨回国的问题，这不仅出于对华侨的关怀和本国社会主义建设的需要，同时也是为了打开华侨问题上的困难局面而作的又一次真诚的努力。我国政府除了一再提请印度尼西亚政府根据华侨的自愿负责遣送他们回国之外，还对接待和安置回国华侨进行了一系列的准备。在印度尼西亚政府表示提供船只运送华侨回国尚有困难的情况下，我国政府为了两国的友好，又主动地派船前往接运。所有这一切充分说明了我国政府在解决华侨问题上所采取的仁至义尽的态度。
    但是，我国政府的这些努力丝毫也不能减轻印度尼西亚政府在解决华侨问题上的责任。首先就遣送华侨回国的问题而言，无论从两国的友好关系，或者从国际道义来看，印度尼西亚政府都有不可推卸的责任。印度尼西亚政府也一再表示愿意承担这种责任。苏班德里约外长在去年12月11日致陈毅外长的信中说过，印度尼西亚政府对于愿意回国的华侨不会阻挠，而且准备给予帮助，以便利他们返回祖国。今年2月16日，苏班德里约外长又向报界宣称：“提供尽可能多的帮助和便利来加速华侨的遣返工作，的确是（印度尼西亚）政府的政策。”中国人民完全有理由期望印度尼西亚政府履行它的责任和诺言。但是，令人遗憾的是，直到现在华侨的遣送工作还遇到许多不应有的障碍。要求回国的华侨受到种种刁难，他们携带物品受到苛刻的限制，他们在出境时受到粗暴的检查，他们的随身物品被任意破坏或扣留。至今还有许多渴望回国的华侨被阻不能起程。我国最近派去接运华侨的四艘轮船到达雅加达后，直到现在，还未能顺利启航。印度尼西亚有势力集团对于华侨回国所采取的这些有意阻难的实际措施，同印度尼西亚政府在这一方面所作过的诺言显然是不相符合的。
    至于谈到印度尼西亚的反华排华活动，我们非常遗憾地指出，不仅没有收敛和停止，反而有变本加厉的趋势。苏班德里约外长上月亲自到西爪哇视察华侨情况之后也承认，对华侨的逼迁“确实给华侨造成了困难和使他们感到伤心”。苏班德里约外长在本月初还宣布，在他的主持下已组成一个委员会负责处理因为受逼迁而致流离失所的华侨的安置问题。人们原认为华侨受到不公正对待的这种处境将会很快得到改变。但是，可惜事实并不如此。迫害华侨的范围更加扩大了，打击和逮捕华侨的行动由乡村扩展到城市；迫害华侨的手段也更加残暴了，越来越多的华侨被逼得倾家荡产、生活无着，甚至华侨社团的领导人也被驱逐出境。特别令人不解的是，当我国政府和人民为了给友好协商创造有利气氛，对于印度尼西亚的反华排华活动竭力采取克制态度的时候，印度尼西亚的一些报刊却继续对我国进行无休止的诽谤和攻击，甚至某些负责官员也发出一些不负责任的言论，诬蔑我国政府干涉印度尼西亚的内政。这种做法，难道能够被认为是有利于合理解决华侨问题和有利于维护两国友谊的吗？
    上述这些情况，自然不能不引起广大华侨的严重不安。目前，在印度尼西亚的华侨，既不能有保障地居留下去，又不能顺利地返回自己的祖国，试问这怎么能够不使他们感到寒心呢？试问在这种情况下又怎能保证华侨在国籍问题上作出真正自愿的选择呢？而且据悉，印度尼西亚当局最近还对华侨选择国籍作出片面规定，这种规定是不符合两国关于双重国籍条约的精神的，它只能妨碍这一条约的顺利实施。如果目前印度尼西亚的反华排华趋势听任其继续发展下去，那就势必会使华侨问题更加复杂化，并且使解决华侨问题上所取得的初步成果有被破坏的危险。
    目前，大批华侨纷纷要求回国，如何迅速地、妥善地安排这些华侨回国是当前最急切需要解决的问题。现在，陈毅外长在他的复信中又一次重申黄镇大使代表我国政府提出的有关遣送华侨回国问题的六点建议，并且表示如果印度尼西亚政府目前提供船只仍有困难，中国政府愿意继续派遣船只接运华侨回国，同时将尽早把启航日期通知印度尼西亚政府，以便印度尼西亚政府预作安排，使华侨回国不致受到不必要的拖延。我国政府的这些建议和表示是完全合情合理的。我们希望，双方通过协商，能够就遣送华侨回国的问题迅速达成协议，并且希望印度尼西亚政府能够立即采取措施，消除人为的障碍，改善华侨回国的情况。我们相信，这一问题的顺利解决，将为全面解决华侨问题创造友好的气氛。
    事情已经很明白，目前华侨问题能不能顺利解决的关键在于双方是否具有真诚合作的态度。遣送华侨回国的问题如此，整个华侨问题也如此。我们政府从来没有，今后也绝不会干涉别国的内政。印度尼西亚政府在本国采取什么样的政策，是印度尼西亚自己的事情。但是，如果印度尼西亚有势力集团以内政问题来作为恣意迫害华侨的挡箭牌，这是中国人民所绝对不能答应的。问题既然涉及几百万华侨的利益，这就不仅是印度尼西亚一国的问题，而是中国和印度尼西亚两国都有关系的问题，那就应当由双方经过友好协商，寻求既有利于印度尼西亚、也有利于华侨的解决。我国政府在这个问题上的立场是坚定不移的。如果现在印度尼西亚政府能够采取适当的措施，使更多的华侨愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍，或者愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚，我们当然欢迎，而且愿意同印度尼西亚政府合作，尽量劝说华侨作这样的抉择。如果印度尼西亚政府不欢迎华侨，或者华侨不想继续居留下去，那我们就只好把他们接回来，但这也需要印度尼西亚政府提供合作，才能顺利得到实现。也只有这样，才能对增进中国、印度尼西亚的友好有所裨益。总之，不论是让华侨继续居留也好，让他们回国也好，都需要双方的合作。不合作事情就不好办；只要合作，就没有什么问题不好解决。
    中国和印度尼西亚是两个友好的国家。我们有着共同的敌人，有着加速自己国家建设的共同愿望，并且都以和平共处五项原则和万隆精神作为指导两国关系的准则。在我们之间有什么问题不好解决呢？为什么要让这样一个本来可以很容易解决的问题成为进一步加强我们两国之间友谊的障碍呢？让目前的这种情况继续下去，只会对敌视中国和印度尼西亚两国友好以及希望亚非国家长期不和的帝国主义有利，对于印度尼西亚人民和中国人民都是没有好处的。必须看到，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊是永恒的、任何力量也不能破坏的；最近两国之间发生的华侨问题，只是暂时的、局部的，而且经过努力是可以解决的。既然全面解决华侨问题已经有了良好的开端，那么，摆在我们两国面前的任务就是双方要真诚合作，排除现存的障碍，促使华侨问题走向顺利的解决。正如陈毅外长在这次复信中所说的：“我们相信，只要双方遵守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，认真地进行友好协商，我们两国间正在进行的谈判就会顺利地进展，华侨问题就可望早日获得全面和合理的解决，两国的友好关系就一定能够得到维护和发展。”
