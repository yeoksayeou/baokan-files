    Friends of the People's China: At the invitation of the esteemed Premier Zhou Enlai, I came to your great country on March 11th, carrying the goodwill and friendship of the Nepalese people. My wife, all the members of my delegation and I are satisfied with and deeply grateful for your warm hospitality. During my visits throughout your country, you treated me as a family member, and I believe this is not only for me personally, but for all the Nepalese people. After returning home, I will certainly convey it to the Nepalese people as a precious gift.

    Your country is a large country, and you are building a new China with great efforts. Everywhere we can see your selfless labor in development and construction. I believe that China's future is bright and happy. Your efforts in construction are a great inspiration to us. We have visited and learned a lot in many places, and we have also learned a lot. I believe that our visit to China this time will help to further consolidate the friendship between our two countries.

    In international relations, you have made unremitting efforts in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the defense of world peace. Through these efforts, world peace can not only be maintained, but will also be developed in all aspects.

    Under your meticulous hospitality, my delegation and I had an unforgettable nearly two-week visit to the People's Republic of China. Now, we are about to return home. We received warm hospitality during our visits throughout your country. On behalf of my delegation, I would like to express my gratitude to you.

    I had friendly talks with the great leaders of great China, and it will always remain in my memory. I express my high respect to His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai for giving me the opportunity to visit China. I will never forget the sincerity shown to me by Vice Premier Marshal Chen Yi, ministers and other officials.

    The friendship between your country and our country has begun to enter a new milestone. The friendship between us is constantly developing. Nepal will make full use of the assistance you have given. This assistance has further consolidated the friendship between us.

    This wish I make at the time of parting is a friendly wish to the Chinese people.

    Finally, I wish you prosperity and strength.

    Long live Nepal!

    Long live China!

    Long live the friendship between Nepal and China!

    新华社24日讯　尼泊尔王国首相毕什韦什瓦·普拉萨德·柯伊拉腊在离开北京的前夕，应中央人民广播电台邀请，向中国人民发表了广播演说。广播演说的全文如下：
    人民中国的朋友们：应尊敬的周恩来总理的邀请，我带着尼泊尔人民的善意和友谊在3月11日来到了你们伟大的国家。我和我的夫人以及全体随行人员对你们的殷切款待，都感到满意并且深表感激。我在贵国各地进行参观访问期间，你们把我当成亲人看待，我认为这不仅是对我个人，而且是对全体尼泊尔人民。回国以后，我一定将它作为宝贵的礼物转达给尼泊尔人民。
    你们的国家是一个大国，你们正在以巨大的努力建设着新中国。在任何地方我们都能看到你们在发展建设中所进行的忘我劳动。我相信中国的未来是光明的、幸福的。你们在建设中所作的努力对我们说来是极大的鼓舞。我们在许多地方参观了并且学到了不少东西，同时也了解了很多东西。我相信，我们这次来中国访问将有助于我们两国之间友谊的继续巩固。
    在国际关系中，在和平共处五项原则和保卫世界和平方面你们已经作出了不懈的努力，通过这种努力，世界和平不但能够继续保持，并且将会在各方面获得发展。
    在你们无微不至的款待下，我和我的随行人员在中华人民共和国进行了一次难忘的将近两个星期的访问。现在，我们将要回国了。在你们国家各地参观的时候，我们受到了殷切的款待，对此，我代表我的随行人员向你们表示谢意。
    我和伟大中国的伟大领袖们进行了友好的会谈，对我来说，它将永远留在我的记忆中。周恩来总理阁下给予了我来中国访问的机会，我表示崇高的敬意。副总理陈毅元帅和部长们以及其他官员们对我表示的诚意，使我任何时候都不会忘记。
    贵国和我国之间的友谊已经开始进入了一个新的里程。彼此之间的友谊正在不断地发展着。对你们所给予的援助，尼泊尔将充分地利用它。这次援助更加巩固了我们之间的友谊。
    我在离别时所作的这个祝愿，是对中国人民的友好的祝愿。
    最后，我祝你们富强、繁荣。
    尼泊尔万岁！
    中国万岁！
    尼泊尔和中国的友谊万岁！
