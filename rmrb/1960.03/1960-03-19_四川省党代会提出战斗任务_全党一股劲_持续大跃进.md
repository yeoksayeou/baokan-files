    Sichuan Provincial Party Congress Proposes Combat Tasks
    The Whole Party Works as One, Continuing the Great Leap Forward
    (Our dispatch) The whole Party united as one, working with one heart and one mind to strive for the Great Leap Forward in 1960. This is the combat task proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to Party organizations throughout the province at the Third Session of the First Congress held from February 25th to March 2nd.
    This meeting was conducted under the personal direction of Comrade Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. The meeting focused on summarizing the rich experiences of continuous Great Leap Forward in various tasks throughout the province over the past two years, and fully discussed the glorious task of achieving sustained leaps forward in the future. The meeting adopted the report made by Comrade Liao Zhigao, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, entitled "The Whole Party United as One, Working with One Heart and One Mind, to Strive for the Great Leap Forward in 1960," and made a resolution.
    The meeting believes that the current international and domestic situation is very good. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, after two years of hard struggle, the people of the province have victoriously completed and overfulfilled the main tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan given to Sichuan Province by the state. The average growth rate of the province's total industrial and agricultural output value in 1958 and 1959 was 1.4 times higher than that during the First Five-Year Plan. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, the situation in which the development speed of agriculture lagged behind the development speed of industry has begun to change significantly, so that all sectors of the national economy can develop more harmoniously. Rural people's communes throughout the province, after rectification, have embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development. With the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, the province's science, education, culture, health, and sports undertakings have also achieved tremendous accomplishments. The cultural and material lives of the people have been further improved. With the victorious completion of democratic reforms in minority areas, the production and living standards in these areas have been significantly improved, and national unity has been further consolidated. Since entering 1960, various tasks throughout the province have continued to present a vibrant and Great Leap Forward situation. The province's industrial production has broken the abnormal phenomenon of "low at the beginning of the month and high at the end of the month" in previous years, and achieved a good start, red every day, and red throughout the whole month. A vigorous and down-to-earth spring production movement is being widely and vigorously carried out throughout the province.
    After analyzing the current excellent situation, the meeting, based on the needs of national construction and the situation in the province, pointed out that the current task of the people of the province is "The whole Party united as one, working with one heart and one mind, to strive for the Great Leap Forward in 1960." To this end, it is required that Party committees at all levels must continue to resolutely implement the General Line of Socialist Construction; implement the guiding ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation and implementing the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture; constantly break superstitions, liberate thinking, and fully mobilize the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the people; and further improve and develop people's communes, tap the potential of all aspects, and ensure that the national economy moves forward at the speed of the Great Leap Forward.
    In terms of agricultural production, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Resolutely grasp grain production and do everything possible to ensure greater grain production increases. At the same time, implement the simultaneous promotion of food crops and cash crops, so that cash crops such as cotton and oilseeds have more production increases. Implement the simultaneous promotion of planting and animal husbandry, so that animal husbandry centered on pig raising can achieve rapid development. And make forestry, fishery, and other diversified operations develop. In order to ensure a large increase in grain crop production and ensure a larger development of cash crops, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of combining large-area high-yield multiple harvests and multiple planting and multiple harvests. It is necessary to vigorously improve the yield per unit area and also expand the planting area as much as possible. It is also necessary to vigorously develop animal husbandry centered on pig raising to ensure the fertilizer needed for increased grain production. It is necessary to adopt the policy of overall planning, key promotion, from low to high, and phased implementation to gradually achieve agricultural technology transformation centered on semi-mechanization and mechanization. At present, it is necessary to further strengthen leadership, conscientiously do a good job in field management of minor spring crops, continue to firmly grasp vegetable production, ensure a bumper harvest of minor spring production, make all preparations solidly, eliminate the three types of seedlings before sowing, and do everything possible to seize a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    In industry, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, implementing steel as the key link, and comprehensively leaping forward. In order to achieve this task, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of simultaneously promoting large, medium, and small enterprises, develop and improve the small-scale and indigenous enterprises, and continue to develop cutting-edge products, greatly increase the variety and output of light industry and chemical industry, and achieve a sustained leap forward in industrial production at a high speed and in proportion in the future. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously solve the weak links of transportation, electricity, coal, and petroleum. Muster greater efforts, fully mobilize the masses, complete plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, and make the greatest efforts to ensure the overfulfillment of steel production tasks.
    In terms of science and education, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" in the spirit of "setting high goals, making up our minds, boosting our energy, and scaling new heights," and strive to establish a scientific research system that basically meets the requirements of the province's industrial and agricultural development in two or three years; education work must continue to conscientiously implement the policy of combining education with productive labor and "walking on two legs" in developing education, and at the same time actively develop secondary vocational education, general education, and various types of spare-time education at all levels. In order to ensure the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the meeting required that all aspects of work in finance and trade, transportation, health, sports, politics, law, and militia throughout the province must be further strengthened and improved.
    In order to achieve the Great Leap Forward in 1960, the meeting especially emphasized that leading cadres at all levels must better study Mao Zedong's works and improve their leadership work and ideological level. Through study, better master the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, summarize and solve some theoretical problems in socialist construction, so as to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies, etc. Party organizations at all levels should also plan to cultivate and expand the theoretical ranks to create better conditions for continuously improving the ideological and theoretical level of the entire Party.
    The meeting pointed out that in order to further improve the leadership level, especially in the county (city) party committee level and above county-level party organizations to establish a strong leadership core, party organizations at all levels must always pay attention to promote outstanding cadres who have been tested by the Great Leap Forward, have a firm stand, advanced thinking, full of energy, selfless, in-depth style, and capable, to enrich the leadership. At the same time, it is also necessary to conscientiously summarize and vigorously promote the leadership methods of the mass line created since the Great Leap Forward, and continuously push industrial and agricultural production to new heights.
    Through listening to reports, studying, and discussing, the comrades present were full of confidence and high morale, and expressed that they must take advantage of the excellent situation, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for the Great Leap Forward in 1960 with the whole Party united as one, working with one heart and one mind.
