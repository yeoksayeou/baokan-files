Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 27th - Representatives from fifteen Latin American countries stated at the closing ceremony of the Week of Support for the People of Latin America last night that the people of Latin American countries firmly support the Cuban Revolution and must carry out revolutions for national liberation and against feudalism.

Gigantic banners reading "Latin America United Can Stop Foreign Aggression" and "Latin American People Support the Cuban Revolution" expressed the fighting sentiments of workers, militia, rebel army fighters, students, women, writers, and artists gathered at the Havana Workers' Palace.

The closing ceremony was hosted by leaders of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the Executive Committee of the Week of Support for the People of Latin America, and delegations from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.

Mexican female representative Clementina Bassols pointed out that it is not enough to simply overthrow dictatorships in Latin America. Bolivian representative Orlando Capriles emphasized that the revolution needed in Latin America is a national revolution that eliminates feudal forces and the rule of foreign monopoly organizations. Jesus Soto, Organizational Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, called for organizing a huge united Latin American front to victoriously carry out this revolution.

Argentine female representative Irene Rodriguez emphasized that the vanguard of this struggle is the Cuban Revolution. Honorio Villacis, leader of the Ecuadorian Workers' Confederation, said that the Cuban Revolution is no longer just the revolution of Cuba. Dominican representative and poet Pedro Mir said that if it is necessary to defend the Cuban Revolution and resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism, the Latin American people are determined to sacrifice everything. Panamanian student leader Andres Cantillo said that the Cuban Revolution, supported by the people of all countries, is invincible.

The contempt for imperialism and the strong confidence in the power of the people are fully reflected in the speeches of some representatives. Mexican female representative Bassols emphasized that in this great struggle, the people of Latin American countries are no longer afraid of imperialism, and they are advancing with full confidence in unity and victory. Humberto Cuenca, Professor of Law at the University of Caracas and Chairman of the Venezuelan Committee for the Defense of the Cuban Revolution, said that the masses of the Latin American people have understood that imperialism is a paper tiger. Brazilian female representative Antonieta Campos Paz emphasized that the Cuban Revolution is the awakening of Latin America. She also read a letter signed by more than fifty Brazilian congressmen supporting the Cuban revolutionary government.

The participants expressed their support for the speakers with cheers and prolonged applause.

The "Latin American Declaration" was read at the meeting. In this declaration, the representatives of the people of Latin American countries called for anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutions and called for strengthening united support for the Cuban Revolution.

Similar rallies were also held in many other cities throughout Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th - San Jose Dispatch: More than a thousand participants responded with enthusiastic applause to the speech by Manuel Mora, leader of the People's Vanguard Party of Costa Rica, at a mass rally in support of the Cuban Revolution. Manuel Mora said on the evening of the 26th that if Cuba is subjected to imperialist aggression, every organized worker in every Latin American country will rise up to fight.

He said that the Caribbean region should belong to Latin American countries and should not become a region for imperialist exploitation. One link in the imperialist shackles has been broken in Cuba, and the next to be broken will be the other links in the Caribbean region. Perhaps it will be the Nicaraguan dictator Somoza himself, who initiated the convening of meetings to oppose the Cuban Revolution. He emphasized that the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution in Latin America cannot be stopped.

Cuban Ambassador to Costa Rica Juan Jose Fusa attended the mass rally. Also on the presidium were Harry Meono, Chairman of the Costa Rican Railway Workers Union, and members of the Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution.

On the same evening, Arnoldo Ferreto, leader of the Costa Rican People's Vanguard Party, spoke at a rally attended by hundreds of workers in Turrialba, a banana-growing area. He stated that the workers of Costa Rica will fight for their brothers in Cuba.

    拉丁美洲团结起来就能制止侵略
    “支援拉丁美洲人民周”闭幕式大会发表“拉丁美洲宣言”
    号召进行反帝反封建的革命和加强对古巴革命的支持
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　拉丁美洲十五个国家的代表昨天晚上在支援拉丁美洲人民周的闭幕式上表示，拉丁美洲各国人民坚定地支持古巴革命，并且必须进行争取民族解放和反封建的革命。
      “拉丁美洲团结起来就一定能制止外国侵略”、“拉丁美洲人民支持古巴革命”等巨幅标语，表达了在哈瓦那工人宫集会的工人、民兵、起义军战士、学生、妇女、作家和艺术家的战斗情感。
    闭幕式是由古巴工人联合会领导人、支援拉丁美洲人民周执行委员会和阿根廷、玻利维亚、巴西、哥伦比亚、智利、厄瓜多尔、海地、墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马、波多黎各、多米尼加和委内瑞拉的代表团主持的。
    墨西哥女代表克莱门蒂纳·巴索耳斯指出，在拉丁美洲仅仅打倒独裁政权是不够的。玻利维亚代表奥尔兰多·卡普里莱斯强调指出，拉丁美洲所需要的革命是消除封建势力和消除外国垄断组织的统治的民族革命。古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托号召组织巨大的拉丁美洲联合阵线来胜利地进行这个革命。
    阿根廷女代表伊雷内·罗德里格斯强调指出，这个斗争的先锋队就是古巴革命。厄瓜多尔工人联合会领导人奥诺里奥·比利亚西斯说，古巴革命已经不仅仅是古巴的革命了。多米尼加代表、诗人佩德罗·米尔说，如果为保卫古巴革命、反抗美帝国主义的侵略需要的话，拉丁美洲人民决心不惜牺牲。巴拿马学生领袖安德烈斯·坎蒂略说，得到各国人民支持的古巴革命是不可战胜的。
    对帝国主义的蔑视和对人民力量的坚强信心充分反映在一些代表的发言中。墨西哥女代表巴索耳斯强调指出，在这个伟大的斗争中，拉丁美洲各国人民已经不害怕帝国主义了，他们正在满怀着团结取胜的信心前进。加拉加斯大学法学教授、委内瑞拉保卫古巴革命委员会主席翁贝托·昆卡说，拉丁美洲的人民群众已经懂得，帝国主义是纸老虎。巴西女代表安东尼埃塔·坎波斯·帕兹强调说，古巴革命是拉丁美洲的觉醒。她在会上还宣读了由巴西五十多名众议员签名的支持古巴革命政府的信。
    与会者以欢呼和经久不息的掌声表示支持发言者的讲话。
    会上宣读了“拉丁美洲宣言”。拉丁美洲各国人民的代表在这个宣言中要求进行反帝国主义和反封建的革命，并且号召加强对古巴革命的团结一致的支持。
    古巴全国其他许多城市也举行了类似的大会。
    新华社28日讯　圣约瑟消息：一千多名与会者在一次支援古巴革命的群众集会上对哥斯达黎加人民先锋党领袖曼努埃尔·莫拉的讲话报以热烈的掌声。曼努埃尔·莫拉26日晚间说，如果古巴遭到帝国主义的侵略，每一个拉丁美洲国家的组织起来的工人都将起来战斗。
    他说，加勒比海地区应该是属于拉丁美洲国家的，而不应该成为帝国主义进行剥削的地区。帝国主义枷锁在古巴的一个环节已经被打破，继之被打破的将是它在加勒比海地区的其它环节。也许就是倡议召开会议来反对古巴革命的尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查自己。他着重指出，拉丁美洲的反封建和反帝国主义革命是遏止不住的。
    古巴驻哥斯达黎加大使胡安·何塞·富萨参加了这次群众集会。在大会主席台上的还有哥斯达黎加铁路工人联合会主席哈里·梅奥诺和古巴革命之友协会的成员。
    同一天晚间，哥斯达黎加人民先锋党领导人阿诺耳多·费罗托在香蕉区图里亚耳巴举行的有数百名工人参加的集会上讲了话。他表示，哥斯达黎加的工人将为古巴的兄弟而战。
