    Female Workers Forced to Sign No-Marriage Contracts
    Italy
    Italian female worker Mara is already in her thirties. Four years ago, she fell in love with worker Giulio and they finally decided to get married. But a week before the wedding, the factory director threatened her, saying that if she married, the contract would be enforced. Because the contract stated: "From the date of my marriage, this contract will be invalid." This means that if Mara wants to get married, she will lose her job. Therefore, this contract is like a shackle around Mara's neck, preventing her from ever getting married.

    女工被迫订立不结婚合同
    意大利
    意大利女工玛拉今年已经三十多岁了。四年前她和工人朱里奥相爱，最后决定结婚。谁知在婚前一个星期，厂长威胁她说，如果结婚，就将执行合同。因为合同里注明：“自本人出嫁之日起，此合同即失效”。这就是说，玛拉要结婚她就要失业。因此，这份合同就像枷锁一样套在玛拉的脖子上，使她永无结婚的日期。
