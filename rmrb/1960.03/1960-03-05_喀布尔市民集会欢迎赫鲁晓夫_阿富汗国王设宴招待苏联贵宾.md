Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, March 4th: According to a TASS report from Kabul, a grand citizens' rally was held today at the "Ghazi" stadium in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to welcome Soviet Minister of Council Chairman Khrushchev, who is currently on a friendly visit to Afghanistan. The "Ghazi" stadium was filled with a festive atmosphere, decorated with the national flags of both Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.

Tens of thousands of Kabul citizens and farmers from the suburbs crowded the stadium's stands and field.

The Mayor of Kabul, Mohammad Sadeq, welcomed the Soviet guests on behalf of the residents of the Afghan capital. He said that the Soviet Union is an old friend of the Afghan people, and the Soviet people and the Soviet government have always resolutely pursued a peaceful foreign policy of strengthening the friendship of the people of all countries.

He said that the Afghan people warmly welcome Khrushchev's visit to Afghanistan. We firmly believe that his visit will help further consolidate the friendly and good-neighborly relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.

The Mayor said that the Afghan people will never forget that the Soviet people and the Soviet government were the first to recognize Afghanistan's independence. He expressed his belief that the existing friendship and good-neighborly relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union will be further consolidated in the future.

Khrushchev spoke at the rally amidst thunderous cheers. He said that in the relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, there has never been a trace of a large country dominating a small country. On the contrary, the relations between the two countries are a convincing example of truly equal cooperation between a large country and a small country.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union cherishes the friendly relations between the two countries. Since the establishment of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan's achievement of independence in the struggle against colonialism and imperialist plunderers, there has never been a small cloud of conflict in the long-term relations between the two countries, and the friendly relations between the two countries have not been diluted by anything.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is now and will continue to provide Afghanistan with various kinds of assistance to help it build various enterprises, roads, and houses to improve the economic and cultural welfare of the Afghan people. He said that the Soviet Union provides this assistance in the manner of mutual assistance between neighbors. The Afghan people can be assured that in their efforts to further develop their country and in their struggle to strengthen political and economic independence, they will always feel the strong support of the Soviet people.

Khrushchev said that much effort is still needed in the world to move more quickly along the path of progress, and first of all, the "Cold War" must be ended and the policy of "strength position" and the policy of threats and blackmail must be stopped.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that the relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan are developing very well. The two countries should continue to live in peace and friendship like harmonious neighbors in the future, and help each other in developing the economies of the two countries and in improving the living standards and culture of the people.

On the evening of the 3rd, Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah held a banquet to entertain Khrushchev. The King and Khrushchev both spoke at the banquet.

On the 3rd and 4th, Khrushchev also visited Kabul's two largest enterprises built with Soviet economic and technical assistance – the Kabul Bread Factory and the Jangalak Automobile Repair Plant.

    喀布尔市民集会欢迎赫鲁晓夫
    阿富汗国王设宴招待苏联贵宾
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔消息：今天在阿富汗首都喀布尔的“加齐”运动场举行了盛大的市民大会，欢迎正在阿富汗进行友好访问的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。“加齐”运动场一片节日气象，到处装饰着阿苏两国的国旗。
    成千上万的喀布尔市民和城郊农民挤满了运动场的看台和运动场地。
    喀布尔市长穆罕默德·萨迪克代表阿富汗首都居民欢迎苏联贵宾。他说，苏联是阿富汗人民的老朋友，苏联人民和苏联政府一向坚决奉行加强世界各国人民的友谊的和平外交政策。
    他说，阿富汗人民热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫访问阿富汗。我们深信，他的访问将有助于进一步巩固阿苏两国之间的友好的睦邻关系。
    市长说，阿富汗人民永远不会忘记，是苏联人民和苏联政府第一个承认了阿富汗的独立。他表示相信，阿苏两国现有的友谊和睦邻关系今后将会更加巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫在暴风雨般的欢呼声中在大会上讲了话。他说，在苏阿两国的关系中从来没有出现过大国驾驭小国的一丝痕迹。相反，两国的关系是大国同小国之间真正平等合作的令人信服的范例。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联珍视两国的友好关系。自从苏联建国后和阿富汗在反对殖民主义和帝国主义掠夺者的斗争中取得了独立以来，长时期内两国的关系中从来没有出现过一小片冲突的乌云，两国的友好关系没有被任何东西冲淡过。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联现在和将来都给阿富汗各式各样的援助，帮助它修建各种企业、道路、住宅，以提高阿富汗人民的经济和文化福利。他说，苏联是以邻居互助的方式提供这种援助的。阿富汗人民可以相信，在他们为国家的进一步发展而作的努力中，在加强政治和经济独立的斗争中，他们一直会感到苏联人民的大力支持。
    赫鲁晓夫说，世界上还需要作很多努力，才能更迅速地沿着进步的道路前进，而首先必须结束“冷战”，停止执行“实力地位”政策和威胁讹诈政策。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏阿两国的关系正在很好地发展。两国今后仍要像和睦的邻居那样和平、友好地相处。在发展两国的经济方面、在提高人民的生活水平和文化方面互相帮助。
    3日晚上，阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿举行宴会招待赫鲁晓夫。国王和赫鲁晓夫都在宴会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫3日和4日还先后参观了在苏联的经济和技术帮助下修建的喀布尔两个最大的企业——喀布尔面包厂和江加拉克斯汽车修理厂。
