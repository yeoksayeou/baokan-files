Xinhua News Agency:

    Guangxi's various ethnic groups have lofty ambitions and great aspirations, vigorously launching a movement to transform low-yielding fields and striving for large-scale balanced production increases. To date, the region has transformed more than three million mu of low-yielding fields.

    Low-yielding fields in the autonomous region currently account for about 30% of the region's paddy fields. In previous years, the region's grain output could not be quickly increased, often because these fields lagged behind.

    In order to achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region organized a large number of technical cadres, experienced farmers, and production activists to conduct in-depth field investigations as early as last autumn harvest. Through investigation and summarization, the broad masses of cadres and people realized that transforming low-yielding fields is an effective measure to achieve large-scale high grain yields.

    From a long-term perspective, the fundamental way to transform low-yielding fields is to build large fertilizer bases in areas with more low-yielding fields to change the soil. The Liuzhou Prefecture organized 200,000 people to transform low-yielding fields, combining deep plowing and soil improvement with large-scale fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and lime burning, vigorously carrying out "three clearances" (clearing field foundations, burning weeds, and sweeping ditch edges) and large-scale fertilizer basic construction at the field side. From November of last year to now, the entire prefecture has established more than 46,000 cattle and pig pens and more than 190,000 fertilizer stations in low-yielding fields. In the entire prefecture, more than 80% of the 1.4 million mu of low-yielding fields have been fertilized with approximately 100 dan of refined and coarse fertilizer. Each commune and brigade in Beiliu County has also established 15 farms each for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in areas where low-yielding fields are concentrated. Animal husbandry farms alone have established nearly a thousand sites, opening up a wide range of fertilizer sources for low-yielding fields. In addition to large-scale fertilizer basic construction at the field side, when delivering fertilizer to the fields, the general practice in various localities is to prioritize low-yielding fields over high-yielding fields. In February, the Libu Commune of Cangwu County organized more than 12,000 people to change the abnormal phenomenon of sending more and better fertilizer to nearby and fertile fields, and less and poorer fertilizer to remote and barren fields, which had occurred in previous years.

    In the movement to transform low-yielding fields, leading cadres at all levels also went deep into the field to strengthen leadership, and through planting "experimental fields" in low-yielding areas, they summarized experiences to guide the overall effort. This year, cadres and members of the Wuzhou Prefecture planted more than 200,000 mu of experimental and high-yielding fields, with more than 50% planted in low-yielding fields.

    Xinhua News Agency: Under the battle cry of "reaching greater heights," Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province is focusing on weak links, boosting morale, and identifying low-yielding areas within high-yielding areas, backward areas within advanced areas, and poor teams within rich teams, launching a mass campaign of higher yields and advanced teams helping backward teams.

    The cultivation and production levels of agricultural production in Suzhou Prefecture have always been relatively high, but the production levels between regions are still unbalanced. Of the 168 people's communes in the prefecture, 40% had an average rice yield of about 1,000 jin last year, 35% had about 800 jin, and 25% had about 600 jin. There are also 194 poor teams in the prefecture. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels in Suzhou Prefecture mobilized cadres and the masses to summarize experiences, focus on weak links, and comprehensively improve cultivation techniques and production levels.

    Zhongxing and Mazhen Communes in Jiangyin County both produced 1,000 jin of rice last year, but their cultivation and fertilization levels had their own strengths and weaknesses. Zhongxing Commune had reasonable close planting and meticulous weeding, but its fertilization level was not as high as that of Mazhen; Mazhen Commune had more and better quality grass mud and a high fertilization level, but its close planting and processing were not as good as Zhongxing. The two communes exchanged experiences, learned from each other's strengths, and both took their production to the next level.

    Low-yielding areas and some poor teams have also fully mobilized the masses to thoroughly change production conditions in response to their own weak links. In the prefecture's 1.6 million mu of low-lying areas, large-scale water conservancy projects are currently underway to completely eliminate the threat of waterlogging. Each people's commune in low-yielding areas has also organized more than 100,000 laborers to engage in large-scale leveling of fields and improving low-yielding soil. In order to thoroughly improve the third-class soil, Kunshan County has contracted the third-class soil to cadres of the commune and team as basic fields and experimental fields for processing and cultivation.

    In order to help the existing 194 poor teams fully catch up with the level of rich teams this year, the entire prefecture has transferred more than 30,000 cadres from the county, commune, and team levels to strengthen the leadership of the poor teams. (Attached picture)

### 广西在薄田远田广建肥料基地  三百万亩低产田大翻身  苏州专区抓薄弱环节争取“更上一重天”

    广西在薄田远田广建肥料基地
    三百万亩低产田大翻身
    苏州专区抓薄弱环节争取“更上一重天”
    本报讯　广西各族人民树雄心、立大志，大搞改造低产田运动，力争大面积平衡增产。到目前为止，全区已改造低产田三百多万亩。
    自治区现有的低产田约占全区稻田面积30％。历年来自治区粮食产量不能很快增加，往往由于这些田拉后腿。
    为了实现今年农业生产更大更全面的跃进，自治区各级党委，早在去年秋收时，就组织大批技术干部、老农、生产积极分子深入田间调查，通过调查总结，使广大干部和群众认识到改造低产田是实现粮食大面积高产的一项有效措施。
    从长远打算，改造低产田的根本办法，是在低产较多的地方大建肥料基地，改变土壤。柳州专区组织二十万人改造低产田，结合深耕改土，大量积肥、制肥、烧石灰，大搞田边“三光”（田基铲光、杂草烧光、沟边扫光）大搞田头肥料基本建设。从去年11月到现在，全专区在低产田共建立了牛栏、猪栏四万六千多个，肥料站十九万多处，全专区一百四十多万亩低产田，80％的田施上精、粗肥百担左右。北流县各公社、大队，还在低产田较集中的地区，分别建立了十五个农、林、牧、副、渔五业场，单畜牧场就建立了近千处，为低产田广开肥源。除大搞田头肥料基本建设之外，各地在送肥下田时，一般都是先低产田后高产田，苍梧县梨埠公社，今年2月间组织一万二千多人改变了往年近田、肥田送肥多又好，远田、瘦田送肥少又差的不正常现象。
    在改造低产田的运动中，各级领导干部还深入现场，加强领导，通过在低产区种“试验田”，总结经验，指导全面。梧州专区各级干部和社员，今年种的二十万多亩试验田和丰产田，种在低产田的占50％以上。
    本报讯　江苏苏州专区在“更上一重天”的战斗号召下，大抓薄弱环节，大鼓干劲，从高产之中找低产，先进之中找落后，富队之中找穷队，掀起了群众性的高产更高产，先进帮落后的竞赛运动。
    苏州专区农业生产的耕作水平和生产水平历来较高，但是地区间生产水平还不平衡。全区一百六十八个人民公社，去年水稻平均产量在千斤左右的占40％，八百斤左右的占35％，六百斤左右的占25％。全区还有一百九十四个穷队。针对这种情况，苏州专区各级党委动员干部群众总结经验，大抓薄弱环节，以全面提高耕作技术水平和生产水平。
    江阴县中兴、马镇两个公社，去年都是水稻千斤社，但是这两个公社的耕作水平和施肥水平都互有长短，中兴公社密植合理，耘耥加工细致，但是施肥水平不如马镇高；马镇公社沤制草塘泥量多质好，施肥水平高，但密植和加工不如中兴好。这两个公社相互交流了经验，取长补短，都把生产提高一步。
    低产地区和一些穷队，也充分发动群众针对自己的薄弱环节彻底改变生产条件。全区一百六十万亩低洼地区，目前正在大兴水利，彻底解除内涝威胁。低产地区各人民公社还组织了十多万名劳力大搞平田整地和改良低产土壤运动。昆山县为了彻底改良三类土，已将三类土包给社队干部，作为基本田和试验田加工培育。
    为了帮助现有的一百九十四个穷队在今年内全面赶上富队的水平，全区已抽调县社队三级干部三万多人加强穷队的领导。（附图片）
