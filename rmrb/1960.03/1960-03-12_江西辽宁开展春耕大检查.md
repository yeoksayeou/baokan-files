Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th: Jiangxi has been conducting spring ploughing inspections in various areas since February, making the various spring sowing preparations better and more substantial.

Local Party committees, county Party committees, and commune Party committees, following the instructions of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, have organized inspection teams and inspection sub-teams at all levels, led by the First Secretary, with the participation of more than one million cadres from the prefectural, county, commune, and brigade levels, as well as representatives of commune members. They are inspection teams, evaluation teams, working teams, and promotion teams; closely integrating the top-down production inspection with mobilizing the masses to further promote the spring ploughing preparation movement.

Grasping ideology at all levels is the main characteristic of the inspection teams' work. Because the spring ploughing preparation work this year was grasped early and done well, a few cadres began to develop a complacent attitude of "almost there." The inspection teams first mobilized the masses to criticize this complacency, thereby further promoting the preparation for spring ploughing production.

The inspection teams in various areas also inspected the planting area of ​​various crops based on the principle of combining multiple planting with high yield, mobilizing commune members to expand the planting area of ​​early rice and other crops in every possible way. After the Ji'an Special District Inspection Team summarized and promoted the experience of reclaiming and transforming hilly red soil, the communes in the entire district organized thousands of commune members to use the red soil to expand the planting of ramie, corn, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and other crops, freeing up more than 380,000 mu of dry land to grow early rice. According to the different natural conditions in different regions, the inspection teams in the counties of the Southern Jiangxi Administrative Region summarized and promoted methods of turning dry land into paddy fields, changing late rice to early rice, and changing scattered land into integrated land, making the early rice area in the entire region expand by more than 530,000 mu compared with the original plan.

For the communes and teams in a few areas where production plans have not yet been implemented, the inspection teams organized commune members to fully discuss and do a good job of "three guarantees," so that plans and areas could be quickly implemented in the fields.

The inspection teams focused on going deep into backward teams, poor teams, and remote mountainous areas to help them discover and solve problems. Xixi Brigade of Bayi Commune in Nanchang County was a poor team, and its preparation of spring ploughing tools was insufficient due to lack of funds. After the commune inspection team discovered this, it allocated a loan of 5,000 yuan from the credit cooperative to help the brigade repair and add more than 4,000 pieces of agricultural tools such as plows and harrows, so that the brigade's spring sowing production could proceed smoothly.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: The busy season of spring ploughing and spring planting is approaching, and the leading departments of Liaoning Province, cities, and counties have organized 15,000 cadres to go deep into the front line of production to conduct inspections and evaluations, promoting the province's spring ploughing preparation work to a new climax.

In the past month, leading cadres of Party committees at all levels in Liaoning Province have stepped up to personally lead the inspection work. Wang Liang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, successively went to Heishan, Tieling, Yingkou and other places to preside over on-site meetings on tool reform and production technology symposiums on wheat, rice, etc., and promoted to the whole province the high-efficiency experience of Heishan County's water conservancy construction realizing soil mechanization. The secretaries of various city and county Party committees also took the lead in leading the spring ploughing preparation inspection work. During the inspection, various places widely adopted the practice of discovering and summarizing advanced experiences, holding on-site meetings in a timely manner, planting red flags, setting up pacesetters, and comprehensively promoting them. After the Yingkou Municipal Party Committee discovered that the Gaiping County Party Committee was focusing its efforts on grasping high-yield fields to drive the overall progress of various tasks in the current spring ploughing preparation work, it immediately held an on-site meeting in Lutun Commune, Gaiping County, with the participation of the first secretaries of the Party committees of various counties and communes, pointing out that vigorously developing high-yield fields is a major revolution in the farming system, and requiring all communes to promote it. After the meeting, a new upsurge of spring ploughing preparation production with water seizure and fertilizer increase and vigorous development of high-yield fields as the center was quickly set off in various counties and communes.

The spring ploughing preparation inspection teams in various places also paid special attention to helping the areas lagging behind in spring ploughing preparation, thus effectively promoting the comprehensive development of spring ploughing preparation work. In the previous period, the progress of fertilizer accumulation and manure delivery in Zhangwu County was relatively slow. With the help of the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee inspection team, the county's daily fertilizer accumulation has now increased by more than three times compared with the previous period, and the daily amount of manure delivery has increased by more than two and a half times compared with the past.

    江西辽宁开展春耕大检查
    据新华社南昌11日电　江西各地从2月份开始进行春耕大检查，使各项春播准备工作作得更好、更实在。
    各地委、县委和公社党委都根据中共江西省委指示，由第一书记挂帅，层层组织检查团和检查分团，吸收地委、县委、公社大队四级干部和社员代表一百多万人参加。它们既是检查团又是评比团，既是工作团又是促进团；把自上而下的生产检查同发动群众进一步大搞备耕运动密切结合起来。
    层层抓思想，是各级检查团在检查工作中的主要特点。由于今年各项备耕工作抓得早，做得好，有少数干部开始产生“差不多”的自满情绪。检查团首先发动群众，批判这种自满情绪，从而进一步推动了备耕生产。
    各地检查团还根据多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，检查了各项作物播种面积，发动社员千方百计扩大早稻和其他作物种植面积。吉安专区检查团总结推广开垦改造丘陵红壤的经验后，全区各公社组织成千上万的社员利用红壤扩种苧麻、玉米、红薯、南瓜等作物，腾出了三十八万多亩旱地改种早稻。赣南行政区各县检查团根据不同地区的自然条件，分别总结推广了旱地变水田、晚稻改早稻、零地变整地的方法，使全区早稻面积比原计划扩大五十三万多亩。
    对于少数地区生产计划尚未落实的社、队，各地检查团立即组织社员充分讨论，做好了“三包”工作，使计划和面积迅速落实到田。
    检查团都重点深入后进队、穷队、边远山区，帮助它们发现问题解决问题。南昌县八一公社洗溪大队是个穷队，因为缺少资金，春耕工具准备不足，公社检查团发现后，从信用社拨出五千元贷款，帮助这个大队及时修理和添置了犁、耙等农具四千多件，使这队的春播生产能顺利进行。
    据新华社沈阳11日电　春耕春种的大忙季节即将到来，辽宁省、市、县领导部门组织一万五千名干部深入生产第一线，展开检查、评比，推动全省备耕工作进入新的高潮。
    近一个月来，辽宁省各级党委的领导干部纷纷出马上阵，亲自领导检查工作。中共辽宁省委书记处书记王良，先后赴黑山、铁岭、营口等地主持召开了工具改革现场会议和小麦、水稻等生产技术座谈会，向全省推广了黑山县水利施工实现土机械化的高工效经验。各个市、县委书记也都分别挂帅，领导了备耕检查工作。在检查中，各地广泛采取了发现和总结先进经验，及时召开现场会议，插红旗、树标兵，全面推广的做法。营口市委发现盖平县委在当前备耕工作中，集中力量大抓丰产方带动了各项工作全面跃进的经验后，立即在盖平县芦屯公社召开了有各县、公社党委第一书记参加的现场会议，指出大搞丰产方是耕作制度上的大革命，要求各公社推广。会后，各县和公社迅速掀起了以夺水增肥、大搞丰产方为中心的备耕生产新高潮。
    各地备耕检查团还特别注意帮助备耕后进的地区，从而有效地推动了备耕工作的全面发展。彰武县前一个时期积肥送粪进度比较迟缓，经过阜新市委检查团的帮助，现在全县每天积肥量比前一个时期增加了三倍多，每天的送粪数量比以前增加了两倍半以上。
