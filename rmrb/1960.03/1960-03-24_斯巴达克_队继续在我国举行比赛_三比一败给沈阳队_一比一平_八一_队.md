Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 22nd: The Shenyang football team defeated the Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team 3-1 today at the Tianjin Minyuan Stadium. The visiting team led 1-0 in the first half.

Most of the players on the visiting team today were young and strong rising stars, and many of the home team's players were also new. At the start of the game, the visiting team launched a quick attack, with the center forward often rushing forward, and the two wingers cutting in from the sidelines to pass and cross, while the left and right inside forwards were active in midfield, creating a fierce offensive. Five minutes after the start of the game, a defender of the visiting team got the ball and kicked it high towards the Shenyang team's penalty area. The ball fell between the two defenders of the home team due to the wind. Before it landed, the goalkeeper of the home team, Sang Tingliang, jumped out to save it, and the defenders also turned to support, but the center forward of the visiting team, Lein Gold, had already taken the lead. When the ball bounced up after landing, he lightly lifted his foot and shot the ball into the empty goal.

After the break, the home team concentrated on counterattacking. One minute after the kickoff, the left inside forward, Gai Zengsheng, received a good pass from the right winger, Wang Youcheng, and kicked the ball into the goal three or four meters in front of the opponent's goal, leveling the score at 1-1. Twenty minutes later, the home team launched another fierce attack and scored two goals in a row within two minutes. After that, although the visiting team launched a series of fierce attacks, they failed to achieve anything due to the home team's tight defense. The score of 3-1 was maintained until the end of the game.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" football team drew 1-1 with the Soviet "Spartak" football team today.

This friendly football match, which ended in a draw, was held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. During the ninety minutes of the game, there were many thrilling and intense scrambles in front of both goals. The competition between the two sides reached its climax in the last fifteen minutes of the game.

The "Spartak" football team played today with skilled and experienced main players. Five of the eleven players were athletes. They were goalkeeper Ivakin, left back Kruzhikov, right midfielder Chistyakov, left winger V. Mishin, and left inside forward Mozer. Most of the players on the "August 1st" team were veterans, and they fielded a brand new lineup, with the famous midfielder Ren Bin playing as the center forward.

The "Spartak" team players who played today were tall and strong, and particularly fast in passing and running. The speed of their transition from defense to offense was extremely fast, often making it difficult for the "August 1st" team's forwards to retreat and assist in defense. In the first half, they had a total of nine shots (the "August 1st" team had a total of six), of which the most thrilling was a powerful shot by the right inside forward Pogorelnikov in the penalty area in the thirty-ninth minute. At that time, Huang Zhaowen ran out to save the ball but missed, but fortunately, the "August 1st" team's left back, Jiang Jexiang, rushed to the scene and kicked the ball, which was heading towards the empty goal, away, averting the danger.

In the second half, the "August 1st" team adjusted its lineup, with Sun Yuming and Wang Xiwenz replacing You Yonghu on the right and Weng Chuanlong on the right respectively, strengthening the defense. At the same time, they also increased the speed of their passing and tried to break free from the visiting team's marking defense, gaining opportunities to shoot in the penalty area. In the twentieth to thirtieth minutes of the second half, the "August 1st" team gained the advantage of continuously attacking the visiting team. However, in the thirty-second minute, the visiting team successfully used the tactics of a quick counterattack. At that time, the left inside forward Mozer received a long pass in the "August 1st" team's penalty area and immediately took a powerful shot, catching Huang Zhaowen off guard.

After conceding a goal, the "August 1st" team launched another fierce attack and finally achieved "results" in the fortieth minute. The center forward Ren Bin got the ball a dozen meters to the left front of the visiting team's goal and shot quickly, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. The right inside forward Zhou Xing immediately caught up and shot again from the right. Ivakin turned to save the ball but it was too late, and the score on the field was tied at 1-1.

    “斯巴达克”队继续在我国举行比赛
    三比一败给沈阳队　一比一平“八一”队
    据新华社天津22日电　沈阳市足球队今天在天津民园体育场以3比1战胜了苏联莫斯科“斯巴达克”足球队。上半场客队以1比零领先。
    今天客队上场的队员大部都是年青力壮的后起之秀，主队队员中也有不少是新手。比赛一开始，客队就展开快速进攻，中锋时常突前，两个边锋则从边线切入传球吊中，左右内锋活跃中场，攻势凌厉。开赛后五分钟，客队后卫得球大脚高传向沈阳队禁区，球借风力往主队两个后卫中间落去，还没落地，主队守门员桑廷良就跃出抢救，后卫也转身奔来支援，可是客队中锋莱因戈尔特已抢先一步，乘球落地弹起时，举足轻轻一挑，将球射入空门。
    休息后易地再战，主队集中力量反攻，开球一分钟，左内锋盖增圣接到右边锋王有成传来好球，在对方门前三、四米处踢进一球，扳成一平。二十分钟以后，主队又发动猛攻，在两分钟内，又连续踢进两球。此后，客队虽接连猛攻，但由于主队防守严密，没有建树。3比1的比数一直保持到终场。
    据新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军“八一”足球队今天以一比一同苏联“斯巴达克”足球队踢成平局。
    这场不分胜负的足球友谊赛，是在北京工人体育场举行的。在全场九十分钟的比赛中，两队球门前屡屡出现惊险紧张的激烈争夺场面。到全场比赛还剩最后一刻钟时，双方争夺达到最高潮。
    “斯巴达克”足球队今天以技术熟练、经验丰富的主力队员上场，十一名队员中有五名是运动健将。他们是守门员伊瓦京、左后卫克鲁济柯夫、右前卫契斯佳柯夫、左边锋维·米辛和左内锋莫泽尔。“八一”队上场的大部分都是老将，他们排出了一个崭新阵容，以著名的前卫任彬踢中锋的位置。
    今天上场的“斯巴达克”队队员身材高、体力强，特别是传球、奔跑快速，由防守转为进攻时推进速度极快，常使“八一”队前锋来不及退回助守。上半场他们共射门九次（“八一”队共六次）其中以第三十九分钟时由右内锋波哥里尼科夫在禁区内的一次劲射最为惊险。当时黄肇文跑出救球扑空，幸好“八一”队左后卫姜杰祥飞速赶到，把这只奔向空门的球大脚踢走，才化险为夷。
    下半场“八一”队调整了阵容，由孙玉明、王锡文分别换下右卫后全勇虎和右前卫翁传龙，加强了防守。同时，他们也加快了传球速度，尽力摆脱客队后卫的盯人防守，获得在禁区射门的机会。在下半场第二十到第三十分钟内，“八一”队取得了连续猛攻客队的优势。但到第三十二分钟时，客队成功地利用了快速反攻的战术。当时，左内锋莫泽尔在“八一”队禁区接到长传球后，马上猛射一脚，使黄肇文措手不及。
    “八一”队失球后再次猛攻，到第四十分钟时也终于获得了“战果”。中锋任彬在客队球门左前方十几米处得球急射，球却碰门楣弹出，右内锋周兴立刻赶上从右方再射一脚，伊瓦京转身扑球已来不及，场上出现了一比一的平局。
