    Parsons' Dead End
    --Observer's Commentary--
    In the past few months, foreign public opinion has been discussing the trends in the United States' policy toward China. Some Western newspapers believe that the United States' policy toward China has changed. The Yugoslav newspapers have gone the furthest in this regard, and they even want to attribute the current state of Sino-US relations to China. On January 28, the Yugoslav newspaper "Free Home" wrote: "The US government's change of policy towards the Beijing government has embarked on the hopeful road of establishing national relations in the near future. ... Now China's attitude is being awaited." But what is the actual situation of the US policy toward China? A speech by US Assistant Secretary of State Parsons on February 19 provides a good answer.
    Although Parsons used carefully chosen words and phrases in his speech, he did not conceal in the slightest the deep-rooted hostility of US imperialism towards the Chinese people. Parsons said, "First, we have not ignored that Communist China has developed into a powerful economic and political force, and for prudence's sake, we must accept this fact." However, this does not mean that the United States will abandon its policy of hostility towards China; on the contrary, Parsons immediately declared that the United States' policy is to "figure out how to deal with this fact"! He frankly stated that the United States still "hopes" that China will experience "internal collapse," but "it is important that our policy toward China is not based on the expectation of collapse," but to implement "a policy aimed at offsetting the growth of (China's) strength," and to "persist in measures aimed at dealing with this strength." In other words, US imperialism is not just sitting at home cursing China's "collapse," but is persisting in activities hostile to China. In order to implement this policy, Parsons once again announced that the United States is determined to continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and to carry out armed interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. He said in a threatening tone, "We will not tolerate a solution to this problem by force." At the same time, Parsons did not deny that the United States is "single-mindedly engaged in military activities in East Asia and Southeast Asia" in order to maintain a "deterrent force" against China. He called the military encirclement and invasion bases established by the United States in the Western Pacific region aimed at China a "defensive shield," and shouted, "We cannot put down this shield!" What is the only conclusion that people should draw from Parsons' entire speech? That is: the US policy of hostility towards China, aggression against China, and threats to China has not changed at all.
    However, while admitting that the United States continues to pursue a policy of hostility towards China, Parsons attempted to shift the responsibility to the Chinese people. He invented a novel logic, as if the United States is hostile to China primarily because China is hostile to the United States. He wants to overturn the entire history of US imperialism's aggression against China. However, history cannot be changed. It is true that the Chinese people recognize US imperialism as the number one enemy. This is the result of US imperialism's aggression against China for nearly a century. It should be pointed out that it was US imperialism that "educated" the Chinese people with countless iron facts and bloodstained facts, so that the Chinese people understood this truth. Not to mention the distant past, but just from the history since the end of World War II, the "education" that the United States has given to the Chinese people has been enough. US imperialism has proved with naked aggressive actions that it is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. It was the United States that provided billions of dollars in aid to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to launch a large-scale anti-people civil war, attempting to replace Japanese imperialism and turn China into a US colony. It was the United States that launched the war of aggression against Korea only eight months after the birth of New China, and burned the flames of war to the Yalu River, openly claiming that the Yalu River was not the border between China and North Korea! It was the United States that, while launching the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, used armed forces to occupy our territory of Taiwan and Penghu, turning it into a US military base. Not only that, but the United States also interfered in our internal affairs, attempting to infringe upon our sovereignty over the Tibetan region. US Secretary of State Herter openly expressed in his recent letter to the Dalai Lama that he would use the false pretense of supporting Tibetan "self-determination" to conspire to split Tibet. It is the United States that constantly threatens and provokes the Chinese people, attempting to suffocate and strangle the Chinese people's cause of liberation and construction from within and without, from political, military, and economic aspects, and then overthrow New China. However, the Chinese people can no longer be bullied. In the face of the mad American aggressors, the Chinese people have not succumbed, nor have they flinched, but have carried out a resolute and tenacious struggle, giving US imperialism heavy blows again and again. Thus, it is not others, but the US aggression against China, that has tempered the Chinese people's fighting spirit against imperialism.
      The Chinese people have always loved peace, and we have always been friendly to the American people. No matter how hard Parsons tries to falsify history, he still cannot point out when and where China has ever sent a single soldier, a warship, or an aircraft to invade any territory, territorial waters, or airspace of the United States. China and the United States are separated by a vast ocean. If the United States had not extended its aggressive forces to the Western Pacific, invaded China, and threatened China, then there would have been no tension between China and the United States at all. The Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence and non-aggression with the people of all countries in the world, and also advocated that international disputes should be resolved peacefully. As early as the Bandung Conference in 1955, our Premier Zhou Enlai stated that the Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States, but are willing to sit down with the United States for negotiations to discuss and ease the tensions in the Taiwan Strait area. Subsequently, in the Sino-US talks held in Geneva, the Chinese side repeatedly suggested that the two countries jointly declare that disputes between the two countries should be resolved through peaceful negotiations rather than resorting to threats or force. However, all these suggestions were rejected by the United States. To this day, the United States is still unwilling to undertake a guarantee of non-use of force in Sino-US relations, stubbornly insisting on armed aggression against China's territory of Taiwan and maintaining military threats against China. The serious military provocation that the United States carried out against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area in the summer of 1958 is an example. It can be seen that the tension between China and the United States is not due to any "challenge" China has made to the United States. On the contrary, it is entirely due to the United States' persistence in being hostile to China, invading China, and threatening China.
    Parsons now even turns the strength of New China into a reason for the United States to be hostile to China, invade China, and threaten China. He said that China has become a powerful force, while the "free countries" around China are weak. Therefore, the United States' "primary task is to help these countries survive" in order to maintain the "balance of power" in the Far East. Parsons also uses the fact that the Chinese people demand that the US aggressive forces leave the Western Pacific to prove that the United States must establish "common defense" and "maintain bases and naval forces" in this region. Parsons' logic is truly chaotic beyond compare! May I ask, if the United States is hostile to China because China is too strong, then why did the United States occupy China's Taiwan when the Chinese people were not as strong as they are today? If the United States is hostile to a certain country because that country is too strong, then countries like Guatemala, Lebanon, Cuba, and Cambodia are not so strong, but why does the United States also carry out armed aggression, subversion, and interference against them? May I ask, if the United States' so-called "balance of power" theory can stand, then the countries around the United States are also weak compared to the United States. Therefore, wouldn't any Asian or European country be able to use this as a reason to send fleets to the US coast to provoke, occupy US territory, establish military bases around the United States, and form a "defensive shield" around the United States to threaten the United States? By analogy, wouldn't any country in the world be able to find a reason to invade and threaten any other country? Obviously, this is completely a robber logic of dominating the world. It does not add any reason to the US aggressive behavior, but instead thoroughly exposes the true face of the US aggressors. It is precisely under the guise of "helping survival," "common defense," and "establishing a balance of power" that the United States has placed many countries in Asia and the Western Pacific under its control and enslavement, turning them into objects of US aggression and also into tools of aggression. As for Parsons' saying that some "countries" are able to survive under US protection, this is also true. The most corrupt, most reactionary, most dark, and most barbaric forces in Asia, such as the Syngman Rhee group and the Ngo Dinh Diem group, would indeed not be able to survive for a single day without the United States. However, under the protection of the United States, these reactionary groups have not "grown stronger" as Parsons boasted, but have become more and more decadent, living from day to day. Because these aggressive activities of the United States have damaged the interests of the people of Asian countries and threatened the peace of the people of Asian countries, not only the Chinese people, but also the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, the Japanese people, the Philippine people, and all the Asian people who have suffered from US aggression, including the people of South Korea and South Vietnam, have shouted the slogan of "US imperialism get out of the Western Pacific." The US aggressors should return from where they came! The Western Pacific is the Western Pacific of the people of the Western Pacific. No matter what reasons the US aggressors use to defend themselves, they are fundamentally untenable and will be driven out sooner or later.
    Parsons' speech can be said to be full of clichés. But at this time, he is also giving a big speech about the logic of Dulles, who has long been sleeping underground, which is not without reason. Parsons told his audience, "You will point out that there is no real solution to our problem in sight. Communist China exists and is growing stronger. We cannot ignore or turn a blind eye to the 600 million Chinese people. You may suggest that we must therefore have a new policy." This means that the US policy toward China has reached a dead end and has reached the end of its rope. This policy has aroused so much criticism that Mr. Parsons has had to make strenuous defenses for it.
    In his speech, Parsons emphatically "refuted" the claim of a section of the American bourgeois politicians concerning the so-called creation of "two Chinas". The essence of this claim is to exchange the "recognition" of New China for the legitimization of the US occupation of Taiwan, so as to continue to use the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group to confront New China, and to wait for an opportunity to make a comeback. Therefore, the common point between this claim and the current US government policy toward China is that they insist on occupying Taiwan; the only difference between them is that the US government refuses to recognize New China. The reason why Parsons came out to "refute" this claim is only because the US government is afraid that the pressure of public opinion will completely overwhelm the US policy of "non-recognition" of New China, which is not conducive to the US's insistence on creating a cold war policy of tension, especially not conducive to the US's intensified aggression and war preparations in the Far East. However, Parsons' outright denial in his speech that the US government is actually engaged in "two Chinas" activities is a statement of "a guilty conscience protests too much". In recent years, especially after the Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles talks in 1958, the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and "trusteeship" of Taiwan has become increasingly apparent. The US State Department's statement on October 8 last year openly denied that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group was "a country or part of a country," but was a strange thing that had neither territory nor a government in exile. Then the State Department issued a booklet on Taiwan, introducing in detail the "geography" and "history" of Taiwan, praising Taiwan's ability to "develop independently," and describing Taiwan as an independent political entity. Eisenhower also deliberately said at a press conference on October 22 last year that there are many countries in the United Nations that "recognize Taiwan's independence". As for the "Conlon Report" issued by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in November last year, it openly advocated the establishment of a "Republic of Taiwan". All these are not just discussions by a section of the bourgeois politicians, but the words and activities of the US government itself. It can be seen that the current plan of the US government is to insist on the policy of "non-recognition" of New China on the one hand, and to insist on occupying Taiwan on the other hand, and to create the theory of "Taiwan independence" in order to legitimize this occupation, and to put the Chiang Kai-shek group in international activities to confront New China. This is essentially also creating "two Chinas" and cannot deceive people. Whether it is the "two Chinas" that Parsons opposes, or the "two Chinas" that Parsons is actually promoting, no matter what form or occasion the "two Chinas" conspiracy appears, it is absolutely intolerable and resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. US imperialism wants to use this method to find a way out of its dead end in its policy toward China, but it is a complete fantasy.
    China has always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy. We do not want to invade any country, but we firmly oppose US imperialism's aggression against our country. It is very clear that as long as the United States continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, insists on interfering in our internal affairs, and insists on a policy hostile to the Chinese people, the Chinese people can only resolutely fight to the end to safeguard their territorial sovereignty and national dignity. This is a solemn position that anyone with national self-esteem cannot but adhere to. If US imperialism refuses to give up its aggression against China, then so be it, let it continue to adhere to its policy of hostility towards China and non-recognition of China for a hundred years, a thousand years, what's so great about it? For ten years, without the "approval" of the American masters, haven't our people lived better and better every day!
    On this point, even Parsons had to admit that in the past ten years, the US attempt to strangle and "contain" New China's delusion has gone exactly in the opposite direction, and New China is becoming stronger day by day. He said: "Indeed, all Americans must understand" that "in the new decade of the 1960s, Communist China may become even stronger." He said: "We cannot prevent Communist China from increasing its absolute power." If US imperialism can learn a little lesson after hitting its head and bleeding, that is not without benefit. But the US ruling group is not willing to admit defeat, let alone change its course. In his speech, Parsons stated that he agreed with the conclusion of the Rockefeller Foundation's report on US foreign policy, that is: for the People's China, the various policies that the United States "can choose in the short term lack creative possibilities". This is the inevitable result of the US monopoly group placing itself in a hostile position to the 650 million Chinese people. What can others do if US imperialism wants to drill into a dead end itself? Whether it is the so-called "two Chinas" or the "non-recognition of China" that Parsons insists on, they will all be like the US policy toward China in the past ten years, "neither able to prevent" nor "unable to offset" China's prosperity and strength!
    The Chinese people have long seen through the reactionary essence of US imperialism and have no illusions at all. Parsons' speech is not surprising at all in the eyes of the Chinese people. If this speech has any effect, it is to put those who are keen to spread the so-called US change of policy toward China, especially the Yugoslav revisionists who viciously slander our country for creating tensions in Asia, in a very embarrassing position. As for us Chinese people, we will continue to look at all the clamoring of US imperialism and its running dogs with contempt and disdain, and stride forward confidently on our own path.

    帕森斯的死胡同
    ——观察家的评论——
    过去几个月里，外国舆论对于美国对华政策的动向，颇有一些议论。某些西方报刊认为，美国对华政策有了改变。在这方面走的最远的要算南斯拉夫的报刊，他们甚至要想把中美关系的目前状态归咎于中国。1月28日南斯拉夫“自由之家报”写道：“美国政府对北京政府方针的改变，走上了在不久的将来建立国家关系的希望的道路。……现在正在期待中国的态度”。但是，美国对华政策的实际情况究竟如何呢？2月19日美国助理国务卿帕森斯发表的一篇演说，提供了一个很好的答案。
    尽管帕森斯在他的演说中使用了精心挑选的字眼和词句，但是他却丝毫也没有掩饰美帝国主义对中国人民的根深蒂固的敌视。帕森斯说，“首先，我们并未忽视共产党中国已经发展成为一个强大的经济和政治力量，为了谨慎起见，我们必须接受这个事实”。可是，这决不意味着美国从此就放弃敌视中国的政策；恰恰相反，帕森斯紧接着就申明，美国的政策是要“设法对付这个事实”！他直认不讳地表示，美国仍然“期望”中国会发生“从内部的崩溃”，不过，“重要的是，我们的对华政策并非以期望崩溃为基础”，而是要执行“一项谋求抵消（中国）这种力量增长的政策”，要“坚持旨在对付这种力量的措施”。换句话说，美帝国主义并不是仅仅坐在家里咒诅中国“崩溃”，而是要坚持进行敌视中国的活动。为了实行这种政策，帕森斯再次宣布，美国决心继续霸占中国领土台湾，并且要对中国人民解放台湾的内政问题进行武装干涉。他用威吓的口吻说，“我们不会容忍用武力解决这个问题”。同时，帕森斯也不否认，美国“在东亚和东南亚一心搞军事”，是为了保持对中国的“威慑力量”。他把美国在西太平洋地区建立的针对着中国的军事包围圈和侵略基地叫做“防御盾牌”，并且叫嚷说，“我们是不能放下这道盾牌的！”从帕森斯的整篇演说里，人们应该得出的唯一结论是什么呢？那就是：美国敌视中国、侵略中国和威胁中国的政策，根本没有改变。
    但是，帕森斯在承认美国继续执行敌视中国的政策的同时，却企图把责任推到中国人民身上。他发明了一种新奇的逻辑，似乎首先是由于中国敌视美国，美国才敌视中国的。他想把美帝国主义侵略中国的全部历史一股脑儿颠倒过来。然而，历史是无法改变的。不错，中国人民认清了美帝国主义是头号的敌人。这是近百年来美帝国主义侵略中国的结果。应当指出，是美帝国主义用无数铁的事实和血的事实“教育”了中国人民，使中国人民懂得了这个真理。远的不说，仅仅从第二次世界大战结束以后的历史来说，美国给中国人民的“教育”就已经是够多的了。美帝国主义用赤裸裸的侵略行动证明了它是中国人民的死敌。是美国以几十亿美元援助蒋介石反动派发动大规模的反人民的内战，企图代替日本帝国主义，把中国变为美国的殖民地。是美国在新中国诞生仅仅八个月以后，就发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，把战火烧到鸭绿江边，公然声称鸭绿江并不是中朝两国的边界！是美国在1950年发动侵略朝鲜的战争的同时，使用武装力量侵占了我国领土台湾和澎湖，把它变为美国的军事基地。不仅如此，美国还干涉我国内政、企图侵犯我国对西藏地方的主权，美国国务卿赫脱在他最近写给达赖喇嘛的信中公开表示要假赞助西藏“自决”之名，阴谋进行割裂西藏之实。是美国经常向中国人民进行威胁和挑衅，从内部和外部，从政治、军事和经济各个方面，企图窒息和绞杀中国人民的解放事业和建设事业，并进而推翻新中国。然而中国人民再不是可以任人欺侮的了。在疯狂的美国侵略者面前，中国人民没有屈服，也没有畏缩，而是进行了坚决的顽强的斗争，一次又一次地给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。这样，不是别人，正是美国对中国的侵略，磨炼了中国人民反对帝国主义的斗志。
      中国人民从来就是爱好和平的，我们对于美国人民始终是友好的。帕森斯不论怎样苦心孤诣地伪造历史，毕竟没有办法指出中国究竟在什么时候，在什么地方，曾经派遣过一兵一卒，一艘军舰或者一架飞机，去侵犯过美国的任何领土、领海或领空。中国和美国远隔重洋，如果不是美国把它的侵略势力伸到西太平洋，侵略中国，威胁中国，那么中美之间根本就不可能发生任何紧张局势。中国人民一向主张同世界各国人民和平共处，互不侵犯，并且主张在发生国际争端的时候，也用和平方式来解决。早在1955年万隆会议期间，我国周恩来总理就曾经声明，中国人民不要同美国打仗，而愿意同美国坐下来谈判，讨论和缓和消除台湾海峡地区的紧张局势问题。接着，在日内瓦举行的中美会谈中，中国方面曾经一再建议中美两国共同声明，应该通过和平谈判来解决两国之间的争端而不诉诸威胁或武力。但是，所有这些建议都一概被美国拒绝了。直到今天，美国仍然不肯在中美关系中承担不使用武力的保证，顽固地坚持对中国领土台湾的武装侵略和保持对中国的军事威胁。1958年夏天，美国在台湾海峡地区向中国人民进行了严重的军事挑衅，就是一个例子。可见，中美之间的紧张局势，并不是由于中国向美国进行过什么“挑战”，恰恰相反，它完全是由于美国坚持敌视中国、侵略中国、威胁中国而造成的。
    帕森斯现在居然把新中国的强大也变成美国所以要敌视中国、侵略中国和威胁中国的理由了。他说，中国已经成为强大的力量，而中国周围的“自由国家”是虚弱的，因此美国的“首要任务是要帮助这些国家生存下去”，以维持远东地区的“均势”。帕森斯并且用中国人民要求美国侵略势力离开西太平洋这一点，来证明美国必须在这个地区建立“共同防御”，“保持基地和海军力量”。帕森斯的逻辑，真是混乱得无以复加了！试问，如果美国是因为中国太强大了才敌视中国，那为什么当过去中国人民并没有像今天这样强大的时候，美国就霸占了中国的台湾呢？如果美国是由于某一个国家太强大了才敌视这个国家，那么像危地马拉、黎巴嫩、古巴、柬埔寨这些国家并不是那么强大的，而美国为什么也要对它们进行武装侵略、颠覆和干涉呢？试问，如果美国的所谓“均势”论可以成立的话，那么，美国周围的国家同美国比较起来，也是弱小的，因此任何一个亚洲国家或欧洲国家岂不是也可以以此为理由，派遣舰队到美国海岸去挑衅，占领美国的领土，在美国周围建立军事基地，把美国周围的国家组成一道“防御盾牌”，去威胁美国吗？依此类推，世界上任何一个国家岂不是都可以找到理由去侵略和威胁另一个任何国家吗？显然，这完全是一种独霸世界的强盗逻辑。它没有给美国的侵略行为增加任何一个理由，却反而彻底地暴露了美国侵略者的真面目。美国正是在“帮助生存”、“共同防御”、“建立均势”等等幌子下，把亚洲和西太平洋的许多国家都置于自己的控制和奴役之下，把它们变为美国的侵略对象，同时又变为侵略的工具。至于帕森斯所说有些“国家”是在美国保护下才得以生存的，这倒也是事实。亚洲最腐朽、最反动、最黑暗、最野蛮的势力，如李承晚集团和吴庭艳集团之流，的确是离开了美国就一天也活不下去。但是，这些反动集团在美国保护之下，并没有像帕森斯所吹嘘的那样“壮大”起来，而是一天天糜烂下去，朝不保夕。由于美国的这些侵略活动损害了亚洲各国人民的利益，威胁了亚洲各国人民的和平，因此，不仅是中国人民，还有朝鲜人民，越南人民，日本人民，菲律宾人民，以及一切遭受美国侵略之害的亚洲人民，包括南朝鲜和南越的人民，都喊出了美帝国主义滚出西太平洋的呼声。美国侵略者从哪里来，就应该回到那里去！西太平洋是西太平洋人的西太平洋，不论美国侵略者用什么理由来为自己辩护，他们根本是站不住脚的，迟早是要被赶走的。
    帕森斯的演说，通篇可以说是陈腔滥调。但是他在这个时候把已经长眠地下的杜勒斯的逻辑大讲特讲，也是不无理由的。帕森斯对他的听众说，“你们会指出，还看不到我们的问题会得到什么真正的解决。共产党中国存在着，而且日益强大。我们不能无视或者掉头不顾六亿中国人民。你们也许会建议，因此我们必须有一项新政策”。这就是说，美国的对华政策已经走入死胡同，已经到了山穷水尽的境地。这种政策已经引起了如此众多的非难，以致有劳帕森斯先生为之作费力的辩解。
     帕森斯在他的演说中着重地“驳斥”了美国一部分资产阶级政客关于所谓制造“两个中国”的主张。这种主张的实质是以“承认”新中国来换取美国霸占台湾的合法化，以便继续用台湾蒋介石集团来同新中国对抗，并且等待时机，卷土重来。因此，这种主张和美国政府的现行对华政策的共同点是坚持霸占台湾；它们的不同点仅仅在于美国政府拒绝承认新中国。帕森斯所以要出来“驳斥”这种主张，只是因为美国政府害怕舆论的压力会把美国“不承认”新中国的政策一下子冲垮，从而不利于美国坚持制造紧张局势的冷战政策，特别是不利于美国在远东地区加紧进行侵略活动和备战活动。但是，帕森斯在他的演说中一口否认美国政府实际上已在进行“两个中国”的活动，却是一种“此地无银三百两”的声明。近些年来，特别是1958年蒋介石和杜勒斯会谈以后，美国制造“两个中国”和“托管”台湾等等的阴谋已经日益表面化。去年10月8日美国国务院的声明公开否认台湾蒋介石集团是“一个国家或一个国家的一部分”，而是一个既没有领土又不是流亡政府的莫名其妙的东西。接着国务院又发表了一个关于台湾的小册子，不厌其详地介绍台湾的“地理”和“历史”，赞扬台湾“独立发展”的能力，把台湾描写成为一个独立的政治单位。艾森豪威尔在去年10月22日的记者招待会上也故意地说，联合国里有许多国家“承认台湾独立”。至于去年11月由美国参议院外交委员会发表的“康伦报告”，更是公开主张建立“台湾共和国”。所有这些并不仅仅是某一部分资产阶级政客的议论，而是美国政府自己的言论和活动。可见美国政府现在的打算是，一边坚持“不承认”新中国的政策，一边又坚持霸占台湾，并且为了使这种霸占合法化而制造“台湾独立”论，在国际活动中抬出蒋介石集团来同新中国对抗。这实质上也是制造“两个中国”，是骗不了人的。不论是帕森斯反对的“两个中国”也罢，也不论是帕森斯实际在推行的“两个中国”也罢，不论“两个中国”的阴谋以任何形式，在任何场合出现，都是中国人民所绝对不能容忍和坚决反对的。美帝国主义想用这种办法从它的对华政策的死胡同里寻找出路，不过是一个十足的幻想而已。
    中国一贯坚持和平外交政策。我们不要去侵犯任何国家，但我们坚决反对美帝国主义对我国的侵略。十分明白，只要美国继续占领着我国的领土台湾，坚持干涉我国内政，坚持着敌视中国人民的政策，中国人民只有坚决为维护自己的领土主权和民族尊严斗争到底，这是任何一个有民族自尊心的人都不能不坚持的庄严立场。美帝国主义不肯放弃对中国的侵略，那么好吧，就让它继续坚持敌视中国、不承认中国的政策一百年、一千年，又有什么了不起的呢？十年来，没有美国老爷的“批准”，我国人民不是生活得一天比一天好吗！
    关于这一点，连帕森斯也不得不承认，十年以来，美国企图扼杀和“遏制”新中国的妄想，正好走到它的反面，新中国是日益强大了。他说：“的确，必须使所有美国人都了解”，“在六十年代的新的十年中，共产党中国可能更加强大”。他说：“我们不能阻止共产党中国增加它的绝对力量”。倘使美帝国主义果能在碰得头破血流之后得到一点点教训，那未始不是没有好处。可是美国统治集团并不甘心承认失败，更不用说改弦更张了。帕森斯在他的演说中表示，他同意洛克菲勒基金会关于美国外交政策的报告的结论，这就是：对于人民中国，美国“在短期内可供选择的各种政策都缺少创造的可能性”。这正是美国垄断集团把自己放在同六亿五千万中国人民的敌对地位上的必然结果。美帝国主义自己要钻进死胡同去，别人有什么办法呢？无论所谓“两个中国”也好，无论帕森斯所坚持的“不承认中国”也好，都将像过去十年中美国对华政策一样，“既不能阻止”，“也无法抵消”中国的繁荣和强盛！
    中国人民对于美帝国主义的反动本质，早就看透了，根本没有任何幻想。帕森斯的演说，在中国人民眼里，是一点也不足为奇的。这篇演说，如果说有什么作用的话，那就是使那些热衷于散布所谓美国改变对华政策的人，特别是恶毒诬蔑我国制造亚洲紧张局势的南斯拉夫修正主义者，处于十分尴尬的地位。至于我们中国人民，则将继续以蔑视和鄙视的眼光，不顾美帝国主义及其走狗的一切吵吵嚷嚷，而昂首阔步，满怀信心地走自己的路。
