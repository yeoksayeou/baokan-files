    Learning From Others' Strengths
    Yang Changwen
    First Tractor Manufacturing Plant

    Comrades who attended the National Mechanical Industry Mechanization and Automation Heilongjiang On-site Conference visited production lines, single-machine automation, and various mechanization and automation projects all over Harbin. They personally felt the deeply rooted atmosphere and the ambitious spirit of the Harbin working class marching towards mechanization and automation, and they were all delighted to be there and praised it endlessly. Every comrade who attended the conference, after returning from Harbin, made great ambitions to vigorously promote mechanization and automation. Now, more than 20,000 employees in our factory, with high spirits and sonorous voices, are learning from and catching up with Harbin. The roar of marching towards mechanization and automation has risen into the clouds, and a mass movement climax of learning, catching up, and surpassing has immediately been set off throughout the factory. The seeds of Harbin have already sprouted and grown in various places.

    Just as the worker comrades said, "New things are new every day, and there are advanced things among the advanced." We need to take some time to visit and learn everywhere, to see what new things have appeared there, how they are cultivating new things, and opening up places for the growth of new things. More looking and more learning can broaden our horizons, increase our knowledge, give us a higher vision, liberate our minds, and learn from others' strengths to make up for our own shortcomings, find our own ladder to climb higher, and encourage ourselves to "go up another floor." We will all have this experience: in these years of the Great Leap Forward, if we don't leave our doors, don't step out of our gates, close our ears and eyes, and sit in a well to watch the sky, we will inevitably fall behind the situation.

    Take our tractor factory as an example. On the one hand, it constantly sends people to visit other places, and on the other hand, it welcomes groups of people who come to visit the factory every day, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers from all directions, some from poor remote areas and some from modern industrial cities. Although they come from different places and go to different places, they all hold the same extremely precious wish to "seek scriptures." They "take" back the "scriptures" they think are useful, and their visits have encouraged us and promoted us to leap forward better. This trend of mutual visits and learning is both a product of the Great Leap Forward and a powerful factor in promoting the Great Leap Forward. It is a vivid scene of the 650 million Chinese people closely united, full of confidence, rapidly changing the "poor and blank" economic face, and climbing the world's peak.

    Some people say that there is no need to visit between different industries. That's wrong. As a worker said, "Different industries are not separated from the principles." Many principles of this industry and that industry are interlinked, so they can not only encourage each other but also inspire each other. Some people also think that others' experiences are not all advanced, so there is no need to visit and learn. In fact, people who are good at learning always "choose the good and follow it." Therefore, in the final analysis, it is still conservative thinking or complacency at work, and these are completely contrary to the national Great Leap Forward and the communist style. The Party calls on us to learn with an open mind, help each other, and rapidly promote advanced experiences and turn them into social wealth. First, we must learn and visit with an open and enthusiastic mind.

    取人之长
    第一拖拉机制造厂　杨常稳
    参加全国机械工业机械化、自动化黑龙江现场会议的同志，参观了哈尔滨遍及全市的生产自动线、单机自动化、以及名目纷繁的机械化自动化，亲身感受了哈尔滨工人阶级向机械化自动化进军的深入人心的气氛和志壮山河的气概，无不欣临其境，为之赞叹不已。每一个参加会议的同志，从哈尔滨回来以后，都立下了大闹机械化自动化的雄心壮志。现在我们厂二万多职工，器宇轩昂，学赶哈尔滨的声浪翻滚，向机械化自动化进军的吼声入云，全厂立即掀起了学、赶、超的群众运动高潮。哈尔滨的种子，已经在各个地方发芽生长了。
    正像工人同志说的：“新鲜事儿日又新，先进之中有先进。”需要我们拿出一定时间到处参观访问，看看人家那里出现了什么新事物，人家是怎样培育新事物，并为新生事物的生长而开辟场所的。多看多学，就能开阔眼界，增长知识，高视远望，解放思想，并取人之长，补己之短，从别人的先进经验中，找到自己登高的阶梯，促使自己“更上一层楼”。我们都会有这样的体会：在这大跃进的岁月，若是大门不出，二门不踩，耳目闭塞，坐井观天，就非落在形势后头不可了。
    就拿我们拖拉机厂来说吧，它一面不断派人到外地参观，一面又天天迎送着成群结队的来厂参观的人，其中工农商学兵都有，他们则来自四面八方，有的来自穷乡僻壤，有的来自现代化的工业名城。虽然来处不同，去处各异，但他们都抱着同一个“取经”的极其珍贵的心愿。他们“取”回了认为可用的“经”，他们的参观又鼓舞了我们，推动我们更好地跃进。这种互相参观学习之风，既是大跃进的产物又是推动大跃进的有力因素，它是我国六亿五千万人民亲密团结，满怀信心，迅速改变“一穷二白”的经济面貌，攀登世界高峰的一个生动镜头。
    有人说，不同行业之间，没有参观的必要。这话错了，一位工人说得好：“隔行不隔理”，这行和那行的许多道理都是相通的，所以它们之间不仅能互相鼓舞，而且能互相启发。还有人认为别人的经验并不都是先进的，不必参观学习。其实，善于学习的人，总是“择其善者而从之”。所以，归根结蒂，还是保守思想或者自满情绪在作怪，而这些是同全民大跃进、同共产主义风格完全背道而驰的。党号召我们虚心学习，互相帮助，要把先进经验迅速地推广开来，变成社会的财富，首先就要虚心地热情地去学习去参观。
