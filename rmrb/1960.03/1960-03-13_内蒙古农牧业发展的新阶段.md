New Stage of Agricultural and Pastoral Development in Inner Mongolia
Wang Duo, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the agricultural and pastoral production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been pushed to a new level and has begun a new stage of continuous leap forward.

The development speed of agricultural and pastoral production in 1958 and 1959 was very fast. Compared with the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period, the average growth rate of the total value of agricultural and pastoral production increased more than seven times; the grain output increased 3.8 times compared with the average output of the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan period (1957 was not compared due to disaster and production reduction, the same below); the grain yield per unit area increased 2.9 times. The average annual increase of livestock of all kinds was 11.9% in the two years, which was 63% higher than the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period.

The above simple figures eloquently illustrate that the agricultural and pastoral production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, like all parts of the country, can develop at a high speed as long as we resolutely implement the Party's general line of socialist construction and a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs", earnestly implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and the eight measures of increasing livestock and protecting livestock through water, grass, breeding, improvement, management, prevention, housing, and labor that we have summarized based on practical experience, and fully utilize the superiority of the people's commune, and rely on the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses. And it has already achieved high-speed development. Now, except for a very few people who suffer from "right-leaning stubbornness" and close their eyes to the facts, all people are unanimously cheering the great victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune in the face of the ironclad facts of the agricultural and pastoral production during the Great Leap Forward in the past two years.

Currently, one question before us is: can the situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural and pastoral production in the past two years continue to develop? Can the high speed we have achieved continue to be maintained? And can it be even higher? Our answer is affirmative. To answer this question, we need to talk about it from the following two aspects.

First, agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The high-speed development of socialist construction requires the high-speed development of agriculture. The high-speed development of agricultural production will inevitably promote the overall upsurge of all sectors of the national economy; conversely, if the development speed of agriculture is slow, it will inevitably affect the development speed of various sectors of the national economy. This has been proved by the experience of the whole country and the autonomous region in the past few years. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the national economy of the autonomous region developed very rapidly, especially the development of industrial construction was very rapid. The emerging industrial cities are expanding day by day, and the newly opened industrial and mining areas are constantly increasing. In particular, the urban supply population has increased even faster in the two years of 1958 and 1959, with an average annual increase of 800,000 people, an annual population increase of nearly 9% of the total population of the region, which requires agriculture to increase more in the output of grain, non-staple food, vegetables and other products. At the same time, as people's living standards continue to improve, the state and the people's communes also need to gradually increase grain reserves, which requires further acceleration of grain production. The rapid development of animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, calculated at a net increase of 15% per year, requires a large increase in feed production to meet the needs of animal husbandry development for feed. The development of light industry requires an increase in the supply of a large amount of industrial raw materials. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual increase in the output value of light industry was 27%. In the two years of 1958 and 1959, the average annual increase was 40.8%, and the future development will inevitably be faster, which requires agriculture and animal husbandry to provide more industrial raw materials. In short, the high-speed development of all sectors of the national economy requires agricultural and pastoral production to produce more grain, oil, cash crops, non-staple food, vegetables, and livestock products to supply the national economy's needs for grain and industry's needs for raw materials, as well as to produce more agricultural and sideline products to meet market supply and export material needs. Therefore, it is very obvious that the continuous high-speed development of agricultural and pastoral production is required.

Secondly, the autonomous region has vast farmland, a large amount of wasteland that can be reclaimed, vast pastures that can greatly develop animal husbandry production, a large mountainous area, abundant forests and wild animals and plants, and 20 million mu of water surface and other abundant resources. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery all have broad prospects for development. In the past few years, especially the Great Leap Forward in the two years since 1958, vigorously developing farmland water conservancy construction and basic construction in pastoral areas, and vigorously carrying out various measures to increase production, have laid a solid material foundation for the continued high-speed development of agricultural and pastoral production in the future. With the rapid progress of production and the improvement of technology, our experience has become richer, our material strength has become more abundant, and our technology has improved even more. What is particularly important is that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the policy that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that industry supports agriculture, and people have a deeper understanding of the importance of agriculture and animal husbandry. After two years of Great Leap Forward practice, the Party's general line of socialist construction and a whole set of policies and measures for developing agriculture and animal husbandry have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Once the Party's various policies and measures are mastered by the masses, they will inevitably become a great force, and will show its infinite power even more in the future continuous Great Leap Forward. With rich experience and knowledge in implementing the Party's whole set of policies and measures for developing agriculture and animal husbandry and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, we have more ways to implement the general line in high-speed development of agricultural and pastoral production; we also have more knowledge of the regularity of agricultural and pastoral production. We have people's commune organizations, which make the rural and pastoral production relations more adapted to the development of productive forces. After rectification, the people's commune has embarked on a path of sound development. This year, we will further consolidate and develop the construction of the people's commune, and the superiority of the people's commune will be more fully brought into play. At the same time, it must also be emphasized that the Great Leap Forward in agricultural and pastoral production in the two years of 1958 and 1959 was only the starting point for the high-speed development of agricultural and pastoral production. The Great Leap Forward in the past two years has opened up broad prospects for the future continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural and pastoral production.

At present, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, like other parts of the country, is in an excellent situation. Whether from the political and ideological aspect, from the requirements of the high-speed development of the autonomous region's national economy for agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, from the objective conditions, material basis, and from the future development needs of agricultural and pastoral production, it will definitely be able to continuously leap forward, and must achieve continuous leap forward.

With the situation that the socialist construction of the whole country and the autonomous region has entered a new stage, the agricultural and pastoral production of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also entered a new stage of continuous Great Leap Forward. In this new stage and new situation, we must accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, further consolidate and build the people's commune, and strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, accelerate the modernization of agriculture and animal husbandry, and build the autonomous region into one of the important agricultural and pastoral bases in the country. This is the general task for us to realize the continuous Great Leap Forward in agriculture and animal husbandry.

1960 is the first year of the 1960s and a year for continuing the Great Leap Forward of the past two years and achieving a new leap forward. In this year, the Party Central Committee further clarified the policy that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that industry supports agriculture, and the state has also vigorously supported agriculture and animal husbandry from investment, steel, machinery, and chemical fertilizers. Therefore, this year is a year in which the agricultural and pastoral technology of the autonomous region begins to enter a new stage, and it is also an important year for carrying on the past and opening up the future. Therefore, the tasks on our agricultural and pastoral front are even more arduous and the responsibilities are even heavier, which requires us to pay attention to grasping the following key issues in the leadership and practical work of agricultural and pastoral production in the future.

First, we must follow the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and clearly establish the guiding ideology that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, that developing industry and developing agriculture and animal husbandry go hand in hand, and that industry supports agriculture, in the whole Party and among all cadres, and take high-speed development of agriculture and animal husbandry as an important task for high-speed development of socialist economic construction, and put the development of agriculture in the primary position. The Party committees at all levels in rural and pastoral areas must focus their leadership on agriculture and animal husbandry, implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, with industry serving agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing agriculture and animal husbandry to support industry. The Party leadership in urban industrial and mining areas should focus on industry, implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, with industry supporting agriculture and animal husbandry, and agriculture and animal husbandry serving industry. All business departments must establish the idea of supporting agriculture and animal husbandry, and support agricultural and pastoral production as they support industry. Putting the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the primary position will not only not hinder the development of industry, on the contrary, only after agriculture and animal husbandry have successfully realized socialist transformation and then realized technological transformation, can agriculture and animal husbandry be more adapted to the development of industry, provide industry with a continuous stream of increasing grain, light industrial raw materials, labor force, and expand market supply materials, and greatly promote the continued Great Leap Forward of industry and the high-speed development of the entire national economy.

Second, take grain as the key link, implement the simultaneous development of grain and industrial raw material crops, and comprehensively develop diversified operations. Put grain in the first place in agricultural production, and while giving priority to the development of grain production, make unified arrangements for ten crops: grain, oil, sugar, hemp, tobacco, vegetables, fruits, silkworms, medicine, and miscellaneous crops, so that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery can all have a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. We must ensure that grain production has a greater increase, and that various crops meet the needs and have an increase.

In order to ensure that the various crops on the agricultural front can develop proportionally and avoid various crops squeezing each other's cultivated land, losing internal balance, and affecting the needs of national economic development, we must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs" for multiple harvests and high yields, and make full use of the autonomous region's favorable conditions of having more land, carry out a large amount of land reclamation, and make full use of scattered vacant land in rural areas to expand cultivated land by 10% in order to expand the planting area of various crops. This will not only increase the area of grain crops, but also appropriately increase the area of cash crops and industrial raw material crops. On the one hand, we will guarantee the increase in the total output of grain, oil, cash crops, etc. from expanding the planting area, and on the other hand, we will strive to improve the yield per unit area by better implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and establish large-scale high-yield fields. In order to achieve this goal, this year we will increase the irrigated area by 4 million to 5 million mu, reaching 25 million to 26 million mu, of which the perennial benefit area will reach 21 million mu, the fertilizer will increase by 36% compared with 1958, and we will fully carry out the movement of applying 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Through the comprehensive measures of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, 25% of the cultivated land will be established as basic farmland to achieve large-scale high yields.

Third, implement the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, emphasize both planting and breeding industries, so that the two are mutually conditional, combined, promoted, and leap forward together. Animal husbandry occupies an important position in Inner Mongolia. In order to enable this year's animal husbandry production to continue to maintain the situation of the Great Leap Forward, we, according to the spirit of taking pigs as the head and the prosperity of the six livestock, combined with the characteristics of the development of animal husbandry in the autonomous region, on the one hand, resolutely implement the policy of both public and private, with public raising as the main focus, carry out the movement of 10,000-pig farms, 1,000-pig farms, and 100-pig farms in communes, production teams, and production squads, vigorously solve the key issues of pig sources, feed, and epidemic prevention, so that pig raising will achieve a leap forward of doubling this year. On the other hand, we will conduct in-depth animal husbandry production movements centered on 100 mothers and 100 piglets, creating high-yield herds. At present, we should strengthen the spring work centered on protecting livestock and taking care of lambs, and improve the breeding rate and survival rate, so that livestock will increase by 32% this year, thereby ensuring a net increase of 15%. While increasing the number of livestock, we should strive to improve the quality of livestock, and actively carry out the improvement of varieties and the selection of superior breeds. While developing sheep, we will vigorously strengthen the breeding work of large livestock to change the backwardness in this regard. Through the high-speed development of animal husbandry, we will promote the continuous leap forward of agricultural production.

Fourth, establish agricultural and pastoral product bases to make agricultural and pastoral production adapt to the needs of industrial development. Through vigorously carrying out basic farmland construction and agricultural and pastoral technology transformation, we will strive to build agricultural product bases in three to five years to produce more grain, oil, industrial raw materials, and other cash crops, and increase the commodity rate of agricultural products. Expand the construction of state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in pastoral and forest areas, reclaim a large amount of wasteland, and strive to establish new agricultural bases within three years to make grain and feed self-sufficient in order to develop agriculture and animal husbandry faster. In the suburbs of cities, new industrial and mining areas, forest areas, and pastoral areas, we will establish non-staple food bases within one or two years to give greater play to the role of agriculture as a foundation.

Fifth, we must vigorously carry out basic farmland construction and pastoral area construction, and implement agricultural and pastoral technology transformation. Taking technological transformation as the center, we will more comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and the eight measures for animal husbandry, and strive to basically realize agricultural mechanization in five to six years, focusing on semi-mechanization before 1962, and implementing both mechanization and semi-mechanization. We will strive to basically realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in pastoral areas in three years.

In 1960, the tasks and measures for agricultural and pastoral production in the autonomous region have been greatly improved, and the amount of labor required for agricultural and pastoral production has also greatly increased. In order to ensure the completion of the task of production leap forward, in addition to tapping labor potential, improving labor organization, rationally arranging labor force, giving play to the superiority of the people's commune, and vigorously developing collaboration, the central link to improve labor efficiency is to vigorously carry out tool reform. Now the mass movement of agricultural and pastoral technology transformation centered on tool reform has been launched throughout the region. We plan to improve the labor efficiency of agricultural and pastoral production by half, one time, or more through a large number of tool reforms, creations, and promotion of advanced tools. We firmly believe that through the tool reform movement, we will definitely solve the difficulty of insufficient labor force and guarantee the Great Leap Forward in agricultural and pastoral production.

Sixth, further build the people's commune according to the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines. The people's commune implements both industry and agriculture, both self-sufficient production and commodity production, and comprehensively develops the commune's economy to accelerate the economic development of the people's commune. The people's commune must persist in carrying out the struggle between the two roads, and constantly consolidate the socialist ideological front in rural and pastoral areas in order to give greater play to the superiority of the people's commune.

Now, the new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural and pastoral areas has been rising with the arrival of spring production. The urgent task of our leadership is to organize this task of the Great Leap Forward better, so that the production Great Leap Forward will advance victoriously, wave after wave. We must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, hold high the red flag of the "three magic weapons" of socialist construction created by our Party—the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune—and stand at the forefront of the situation to lead the development of the situation. This requires our cadres at all levels to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, arm the broad masses of cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, fully recognize the importance of agricultural and pastoral development, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and establish the communist ambitions of continuous Great Leap Forward. Deeply summarize the rich experience of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in implementing the general line and the policy of agricultural and pastoral production, implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and the eight measures for animal husbandry in the past two years, and apply the rich and successful experience and knowledge of the regularity of agricultural and pastoral production that we have gained in practice better in this year's actual work, vigorously promote various advanced experiences, resolutely implement political command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and vigorously carry out the method of experimental fields, so that the broad masses of cadres and masses can always maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm to promote the high-speed development of agricultural and pastoral production.

    内蒙古农牧业发展的新阶段
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记　王铎
    经过1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进，内蒙古自治区的农业和畜牧业生产，已经推向一个新的水平，并开始了一个持续跃进的新阶段。
    1958年和1959年两年的农牧业生产发展速度是很快的，这两年平均增长速度同第一个五年计划期间平均增长速度比较，农牧业生产总值增长七倍多；粮食产量比第一个五年计划期间的前四年（1957年因灾减产，未作比较，下同）平均产量增长三点八倍；粮食单位面积产量增长二点九倍。畜牧业各类牲畜两年平均增长11．9％，比第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度增长63％。
    上边这些简单的数字，雄辩地说明了内蒙古自治区的农牧业生产和全国各地一样，只要我们坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，切实执行农业“八字宪法”和我们自己根据实践经验总结出来的水、草、繁、改、管、防、舍、工增畜保畜的八项措施，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，依靠广大群众的冲天干劲，农牧业生产是能够高速度发展的，并且已经实现了高速度发展。现在，对过去两年农牧业生产大跃进的铁的事实，除了极少数患了“右倾顽症”和闭着眼睛不看事实的人以外，所有的人都无不齐声欢呼总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利。
    当前，摆在我们面前的一个问题是：过去两年农牧业生产大跃进的局面，是否能够持续发展下去？我们已经取得的高速度，是否还会继续保持下去？并使它能够更高些？我们的答复是肯定的。答复这个问题，需要从以下两方面来说。
    首先，农业是国民经济的基础。社会主义建设高速度地发展，要求农业必须是高速度地发展。农业生产高速度地发展，必然会促进国民经济各个部门全面的高涨；反之，如果农业发展的速度慢，也必然影响到国民经济各部门的发展速度。这是已经为全国和自治区几年来的经验证明了的。大跃进的两年来，自治区的国民经济的发展是很快的，特别是工业建设的发展非常迅速。新兴的工业城市日益扩大，新开辟的工矿区不断增加，特别是1958年和1959年两年来城市供应人口增加得更快，这两年每年平均增加八十万人，每年人口增加将近全区总人口的9％，这就要求农业在粮食、副食品、蔬菜等产品产量上有更多的增加。同时，由于人们生活水平的不断提高，国家和人民公社还需要逐渐增加粮食的储备，这就更需要加快粮食的增产。内蒙古自治区畜牧业的迅速发展，每年按纯增15％计算，饲料的生产必须大量地增加，才能满足发展畜牧业生产对饲料的需要。轻工业的发展，要求增加大量工业原料的供应，第一个五年计划期间，轻工业产值五年平均增长27％，1958年和1959年两年平均就增长了40．8％，而今后的发展，必然更快，这就要求农牧业提供更多的工业原料。总之，国民经济各部门的高速度发展，都要求农牧业生产出更多的粮食、油料、经济作物、副食品、蔬菜、畜产品，以供应国民经济发展对粮食的需要和工业的发展对于原料的需要，以及生产出更多的农副产品，满足市场供应和出口物资的需要。因而，要求农牧业生产持续高速度的发展，这是很明显的。
    其次，自治区有广阔的农田，有大量可以开垦的荒地，有广大的牧场可以大量发展畜牧业生产，有很大的山林地区，有丰富的林木和野生动植物，有两千万亩的水面等资源丰富，农、林、牧、副、渔五业都有广阔的发展前途。过去几年，特别是从1958年起两年来的大跃进，大力发展农田水利建设、牧区基本建设，大搞各项增产措施，为今后继续高速度发展农牧业生产打下了雄厚的物质基础。随着生产的突飞猛进和技术的提高，我们的经验更加丰富了，物质力量更加雄厚了，技术更加提高了。特别重要的是，党中央和毛主席提出农业是国民经济的基础，工业支援农业的方针，人们对农牧业的重要性，认识更深入了。经过两年大跃进的实践，党的社会主义建设总路线和发展农牧业的一整套方针政策，更加深入人心。党的各项方针政策一旦为群众所掌握，就必然变成伟大的力量，在今后持续大跃进中，将会更加显示出它的无穷威力。有了执行党的发展农牧业一整套方针和农业“八字宪法”的丰富经验和知识，使我们在高速度发展农牧业生产上，贯彻执行总路线的办法更多了；我们对农牧业生产规律性的知识也更多了。我们有了人民公社组织，使农村牧区生产关系更加适应生产力的发展。人民公社经过整顿之后，已经走上了健全发展的道路，今年再进一步继续巩固和发展人民公社的建设，人民公社的优越性，必将更加充分地发挥出来。同时，还必须着重指出，1958年和1959年两年农牧业生产的大跃进，只是高速度发展农牧业生产的起点，过去两年的大跃进，已经为今后农牧业生产持续大跃进开辟了广阔的道路。
    目前，内蒙古自治区同全国其他各地一样，是一片大好形势。无论从政治思想方面来说，从自治区国民经济高速度发展对于国民经济基础的农业的要求来说，从客观条件，物质基础和从农牧业生产今后的发展需要来说，都一定能够持续跃进，并且必须实现持续跃进。
    随着全国和自治区社会主义建设已经进入了一个新阶段的形势，内蒙古自治区的农牧业也进入了一个持续大跃进的新阶段。在这新阶段新形势下，我们必须加速农牧业的技术改造，进一步巩固和建设人民公社，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要，为加速实现农牧业的现代化，把自治区建设成为全国重要的农牧业基地之一而奋斗。这就是我们实现农牧业的持续大跃进的总任务。
    1960年是二十世纪六十年代开始的一年，是继续过去两年大跃进实现新的跃进的一年。在这一年，党中央进一步明确规定了农业是国民经济基础和工业支援农业的方针，国家又从投资、钢材、机械、化肥等方面大力支援农牧业。因而这一年是自治区农牧业技术开始进入一个新的阶段的一年，又是承上启下的重要一年。因此，我们农牧业战线上的任务更加艰巨了，责任更加繁重了，这就要求我们在今后的农牧业生产的领导上和实际工作中，必须注意抓紧以下几个关键问题。
    第一，必须遵循中央和毛主席的指示，在全党和全体干部中明确地树立起农业是国民经济的基础，发展工业和发展农牧业同时并举，工业支援农业为方针的指导思想，把高速度发展农牧业作为高速度发展社会主义经济建设的重要任务，把发展农业列为首要地位。农村、牧区各级党委必须把领导重点放在农牧业上，实行工农并举，工业服务于农牧业，发展农牧业以支援工业。各城市工矿区党的领导应以工业为重点，实行工农并举，工业支援农牧业，农牧业服务于工业。各个业务部门都要树立起支援农牧业的思想，像支援工业那样，支援农牧业生产。把发展农牧业放在首要地位，这不但不会妨碍工业的发展，相反，只有农牧业在胜利实现社会主义改造之后，又实现技术改造，才能使农牧业更适应工业的发展，为工业发展提供源源不断越来越多的粮食、轻工业原料、劳动力和扩大市场供应物资，才能大大促进工业的继续大跃进和整个国民经济的高速度发展。
    第二，以粮为纲，实行粮食和工业原料作物并举，全面发展多种经营。把粮食列为农业生产的首位，在优先发展粮食生产的同时，对粮、油、糖、麻、烟、蔬、果、蚕、药、杂十项作物统一安排，使农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进。要做到既使粮食有更大的增产，又使各种作物适应需要，都有增产。
    为了做到农业战线上各项作物能够有比例地发展和避免各种作物互相挤占耕地，失去内部平衡，影响国民经济的发展需要，必须坚决贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收“两条腿走路”的方针，充分利用自治区土地多的有利条件，进行大量开荒和充分利用农村零散空地使耕地扩大10％，以扩大各种作物的种植面积。这样不仅能使粮食作物的面积增加，而且还能适当地增加经济作物和工业原料作物的面积。我们一方面从扩大种植面积来保证粮食、油料、经济作物等总产量的增加，另一方面从更好地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，来努力提高单位面积产量，建立大面积高额丰产田。为实现这一目的，今年增加水利灌溉面积四百万到五百万亩，灌溉面积达到二千五百万到二千六百万亩，其中常年受益面积达到二千一百万亩，肥料比1958年增加36％，全面开展亩施万斤肥运动。通过农业“八字宪法”综合措施，使25％的耕地建立成基本农田，实现大面积高额丰产。
    第三，实行农牧结合，种植业和饲养业并重，使二者互为条件，互相结合，互相促进，共同跃进。畜牧业在内蒙古地区占有重要地位。为了使今年畜牧业生产能够继续保持大跃进的局面，我们根据以猪为首、六畜兴旺的精神结合自治区畜牧业发展的特点，一方面坚决贯彻公私并举，以公养为主的方针，开展公社、生产队、生产小队万猪场、千猪场、百猪场运动，大力解决猪源、饲料、防疫几个关键问题，使今年养猪实现翻一番的跃进，另一方面深入开展以百母百仔为中心、创造高产群的畜牧业大生产运动。当前应该加强以保畜接羔保育为中心的过春工作，提高繁殖率成活率，使今年牲畜增殖32％，从而保证纯增15％。在增加牲畜数量的同时，努力提高牲畜质量，积极进行品种的改良和优种的选育工作。在发展羊的同时，大力加强大牲畜的繁殖工作，以改变这方面的落后现象。通过畜牧业的高速度发展，促进农业生产的持续跃进。
    第四，建立农牧产品基地，使农牧业生产适应工业发展的需要。通过大力进行农田基本建设和农牧业技术改造，争取在三、五年内把农产品基地建设起来，以生产更多的粮食、油料、工业原料和其它经济作物，并提高农产品的商品率。在牧区、林区扩大国营农牧场的建设，大量开垦荒地，争取三年内建立新的农业基地，使粮食、饲料能够自给，以更快地发展农牧业。在城市的郊区、新的工矿区、林区和牧区，在一、两年内把副食品基地建立起来，使农业这个基础发挥更大作用。
    第五，必须大搞农田基本建设和牧区建设，实行农牧业技术改造。以技术改造为中心，更加全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”和畜牧业的八项措施，争取五年到六年时间基本实现农业机械化，1962年前以半机械化为重点，实行机械化半机械化并举。牧区争取三年基本实现机械化和半机械化。
    1960年自治区农牧业生产，无论各项任务和措施都大大提高了，用于农牧业生产的需工量也大大增加了。为了保证实现生产跃进的任务，除了要挖掘劳动潜力，改进劳动组织，合理安排劳动力，发挥人民公社的优越性，大兴协作而外，提高劳动效率的中心环节是大搞工具改革。现在全区以工具改革为中心的农牧业技术改造的群众运动已经开展起来。我们计划经过大量的改革工具创制和推广先进工具，使农牧业生产的劳动效率提高半倍、一倍或更多一些。我们深信，通过工具改革运动，一定会解决劳动力不足的困难，保证农牧业生产的大跃进。
    第六，根据中央的方针政策，进一步建设人民公社。人民公社实行工业和农业并举，自给性生产和商品性生产并举，全面发展公社经济，以加速人民公社的经济发展。人民公社必须坚持进行两条道路的斗争，不断巩固农村牧区的社会主义思想阵地，才能更加发挥人民公社的优越性。
    现在，农牧区新的跃进的高潮已经随着春季生产的到来，正日益高涨。我们领导上的迫切任务是要把这个大跃进的任务组织得更好，使生产大跃进一浪比一浪高地胜利前进。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，高举我党创造的社会主义建设“三大法宝”——总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，站在形势的前头领导形势的发展。这就需要我们各级干部认真地学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想把广大干部武装起来，充分认识农牧业发展的重要性，克服右倾保守思想，树立起持续大跃进的共产主义雄心大志。深入地总结内蒙古自治区两年来贯彻执行总路线和农牧业生产的方针，贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”和牧业八项措施的丰富经验，把我们在实践中取得的丰富的、成功的经验和农牧业生产规律性的知识，更好地运用在今年实际工作中去，大力推广各种先进经验，坚决贯彻执行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大搞试验田的方法，使广大干部和群众经常保持旺盛的革命干劲，以促进农牧业生产高速度的发展。
