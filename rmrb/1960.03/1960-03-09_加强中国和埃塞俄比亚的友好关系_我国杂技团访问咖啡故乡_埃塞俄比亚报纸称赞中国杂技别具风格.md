Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, March 8th. Wang Yutian, the Chinese Ambassador to Sudan currently visiting Ethiopia, and the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe led by Qu Wu, returned to Addis Ababa on the afternoon of the 7th after a three-day visit to Jimma in Ethiopia's Kaffa Province, the homeland of coffee. They were accompanied on their visit by Innaisu, Assistant Minister of Education and Art of Ethiopia, and Asfo, Director of the Information Department Office.

When they left Jimma, Jimma Mayor Enkoselase entertained the Chinese guests on behalf of Kaffa Province Governor Kuanselase, and saw the guests off five kilometers from Jimma City.

The Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe went to Jimma after performing eleven shows in Addis Ababa. They performed three shows in Jimma, each of which was warmly welcomed by the audience. During each performance, many people crowded outside the theater, standing on tiptoe to watch the performance from the windows.

On the morning of the 5th, Wang Yutian and Qu Wu paid a courtesy call to Kaffa Province Governor Inguzuf. The Governor expressed his hope that the friendly and cultural relations between Ethiopia and China would further develop. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Governor held a cocktail party for the Chinese guests, and presented the silver Jimma City emblem to the Chinese guests amidst warm applause. Accompanied by the Director of the Provincial Government Office and the Mayor of Jimma, the Chinese guests visited the coffee experiment center of the agricultural technical school and also visited coffee plantations.

Ethiopian newspapers gave high praise to the acrobatic troupe's performances. The "Ethiopian Herald" said in a commentary that the performance of the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe is different from everything that Addis Ababa has seen so far. The Chinese acrobats combine bravery and grace, agility and skill, and they have repeatedly won the applause of the Ethiopian audience. The "Ethiopian Voice" wrote that every program on the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe's program list is unique in style. "In every program, one can see unparalleled precision and artistry."

    我国杂技团访问咖啡故乡
    埃塞俄比亚报纸称赞中国杂技别具风格
    新华社亚的斯亚贝巴8日电　目前正在埃塞俄比亚访问的中国驻苏丹大使王雨田以及由团长屈武率领的中国杂技艺术团，在咖啡故乡埃塞俄比亚咖法省的今马进行了三天访问后，7日下午回到亚的斯亚贝巴。陪同他们进行访问的有埃塞俄比亚的教育和艺术部助理大臣因奈苏，情报部办公厅主任阿斯福。
    在他们离开今马时，今马市市长恩科塞拉塞代表咖法省省长款待了中国客人，并把客人送到离今马市五公里的地方。
    中国的杂技艺术团是在亚的斯亚贝巴进行了十一场表演后到今马的。他们在今马进行了三场表演，每次演出都受到观众的热烈欢迎。在每场演出过程中，很多人挤在戏院的外面，踮起脚从窗户中观看表演。
    在5日上午，王雨田和屈武拜会了咖法省省长因古祖夫。省长表示希望埃塞俄比亚和中国之间的友好和文化关系进一步发展。7日下午，省长为中国客人举行了鸡尾酒会，他在热烈的掌声中把银质的今马市徽送给了中国客人。中国客人在省政府办公厅主任和今马市长陪同下，参观了农业技术学校的咖啡试验中心，并且参观了咖啡种植园。
    埃塞俄比亚报纸对杂技团的演出给予了很高评价。“埃塞俄比亚呼声报”在评论中说，中国杂技艺术团的表演不同于亚的斯亚贝巴到现在为止所看到的一切表演。中国杂技演员们把勇敢和优美结合在一起，把灵巧和技艺结合在一起，他们一次又一次地获得了埃塞俄比亚观众的掌声。“埃塞俄比亚先驱报”写道，中国杂技艺术团节目单上的每一个节目都别具风格。“从每一个节目中都可以看到无比的精确性和艺术性。”
