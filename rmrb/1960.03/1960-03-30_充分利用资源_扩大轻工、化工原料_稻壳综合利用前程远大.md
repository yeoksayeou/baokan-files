    To make full use of resources and expand raw materials for light industry and chemical industry
    Comprehensive Utilization of Rice Husks Has Broad Prospects
    This newspaper reports that grain processing departments across the country have made significant achievements in the comprehensive utilization of rice husks. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 20 products made from rice husks as raw materials, including furfural, sodium acetate, creosote oil, asphalt, activated carbon, water glass, sodium fluorosilicate, and rice husk gas. These products have begun to be used in the food, printing and dyeing, enamel, and plastics industries.
    In the past, rice husks were mostly used as fuel, mixed with mud for plastering walls, or as filling materials for winemaking and packaging. Some areas also used rice husks as feed.
    In the past two years, the comprehensive utilization of rice husks has been widely carried out in Guangxi, Hunan, Jilin, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places. Preliminary test results show that a series of products can be obtained by dry distillation of rice husks. For example, Changsha Rice Mill in Hunan Province, with the help of the Grain Department, produced methanol, acetone, phenol oil, calcium acetate, asphalt, activated carbon, water glass, and other products from rice husks, with an output value more than 60 times that of the original rice husks. Wuzhou Rice Mill in Guangxi Province has made sodium acetate from rice husks that meets market needs and is now supplied to printing and dyeing factories in large quantities, which is welcomed by users. Creosote oil can be supplied to button factories to manufacture phenolic plastics, solving the current shortage of carbolic acid supply; the activated carbon produced from rice husks has a high decolorizing power and is now used to refine monosodium glutamate and glucose. Jilin Grain Processing Factory uses the糠炭 (kāng tàn - charcoal made from rice husks) after dry distillation to make sodium fluorosilicate, which is supplied to enamel factories as an opacifier to replace cryolite powder, with good quality and a purity of over 98%.
    Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi and other provinces also use rice husks to produce rice husk gas on a large scale, which is used as power fuel to drive engines or for power generation. In many areas, the power fuel for grain processing is also rice husk gas. According to the use of rice husk gas in Guangdong Province, every 36 horsepower engine consumes 2,000 catties of coal in 24 hours, worth more than 70 yuan; if electricity is used, 650 kWh are needed, worth more than 50 yuan. However, only 6,000 catties of rice husks are needed, worth only more than 20 yuan.
    In the past, due to the limited uses of rice husks and their extremely low value, rice husks were piled up in large quantities as waste from grain processing factories during the peak season of rice processing. How to dispose of these materials was a heavy burden for rice processing factories. Now, the achievements of comprehensive utilization of rice husks have completely changed the old situation. This year, grain departments in various regions will build a new batch of rice husk dry distillation factories and rice husk hydrolysis factories to carry out production and experimentation simultaneously, create complete models, and prepare for the comprehensive and universal utilization of rice husks in the future.

### 充分利用资源　扩大轻工、化工原料  稻壳综合利用前程远大

    充分利用资源　扩大轻工、化工原料
    稻壳综合利用前程远大
    本报讯　全国各地粮食加工部门大搞稻壳综合利用，已获得显著成果。据初步统计，利用稻壳作原料生产的产品有：糠醛、醋酸钠、杂酚油、沥青、活性炭、水玻璃及氟硅酸钠、糠煤气等二十多种。这些产品已开始应用在食品、印染、搪瓷和塑料等工业方面。
    过去，各地对稻壳的使用，大都用来当燃料，和泥掺在一起抹墙，或作酿酒、包装的填料，也有些地区用稻壳做饲料。
    两年来，在广西、湖南、吉林、四川、贵州等地普遍开展了稻壳综合利用，初步试验结果，采用稻壳干馏的方法，可以得到一系列的产品。如湖南长沙米厂在粮食厅的帮助下，用稻壳生产出甲醇、丙酮、酚油、醋石、沥青、活性炭、水玻璃等产品，产值相当于原来稻壳的六十多倍。广西梧州市碾米厂用稻壳制成了合乎市场需要的醋酸钠，现在已经大量供应印染厂使用，受到用户的欢迎。杂酚油可以供给钮扣厂制造酚醛塑料，解决了当前石炭酸供应不足的问题；用稻壳生产的活性炭脱色力很高，现在用来精制味精和葡萄糖。吉林市粮谷加工厂利用干馏后的糠炭，又制成氟硅酸钠，供应给搪瓷厂作乳浊剂，代替冰晶粉，质量良好，纯度达到98％以上。
    湖北、广东、江西等省，还利用稻壳大搞稻壳煤气，作为动力燃料带动引擎，或者用于发电。很多地区粮食加工的动力燃料，也都是使用的稻壳煤气。根据广东省利用稻壳煤气的情况，每三十六马力的动力，在二十四小时中，用煤二千斤，价值七十多元；若用电需要六百五十度，价值五十多元。而用稻壳只需要六千斤，价值仅二十多元。
    过去，由于稻壳的用途有限，价值极低，在稻谷加工旺季，稻壳作为粮食加工厂的废物大量堆积，如何处理这些物资曾是大米加工厂的沉重负担。现在，稻壳综合利用的成果，已使旧的面貌彻底改观。今年，各地粮食部门将新建一批稻壳干  工厂和稻壳水解工厂，进行边生产边试验，创造完整典型，为今后全面的、普遍的综合利用稻壳做好准备。（附图片）
