At two o'clock in the morning, Lü Jingxin, the first secretary of the Taodeng Commune Party Committee in Laibin County, returned from a meeting at the county Party committee. He rode his bicycle for more than 40 kilometers and was very tired, and should have gone to bed for a good night’s sleep. However, he recalled the eagerness to grasp the spring plowing production early and well, and the competitive spirit of the communes, which was discussed at the county Party committee meeting, and many questions flooded his mind. He felt that the key step at present was to seize the season and transplant rice seedlings in a timely manner. But how can we win this battle? How is the current preparatory work going? ... Thinking of this, he rushed to the key Taodeng brigade of the commune overnight. Unexpectedly, the members of the key team were still doing things according to the old calendar. It was almost March, but there was no sign of transplanting rice seedlings here. Team leader Qin Yinghan even said with a satisfied tone that the old habits of farming in the era of small-scale peasant economy had been changed a lot. This year, many things were done faster than in the past. In the past, rice fields were not planted until Qingming, but this year the seedlings have grown tall, and the fields have been plowed, harrowed, and fertilized. But when it comes to transplanting rice seedlings, he shook his head and said: "It's too cold, it's impossible to transplant rice seedlings immediately." Lü Jingxin realized that fear of the cold weather was an important ideological obstacle to carrying out rice transplanting. It was difficult to convince everyone by just talking, so he decided to do it himself first and make a demonstration.

On March 1st, it was drizzling, and Lü Jingxin began to transplant rice seedlings in his experimental field. He drained the excess water from the field, leaving only about half an inch of water, then evenly spread a layer of heat-preserving fertilizer, and then transplanted the seedlings according to the 6×4 specification, with seven seedlings per clump. After the seedlings were transplanted, he carefully observed the changes in the weather every day. When it rained, he ran to the field in the middle of the night to irrigate; when the sun came out during the day, he immediately drained the water from the field. After four or five days, the seedlings had taken root and turned oily green. Not only were they not damaged by the cold, but they also grew an inch taller.

This incident quickly spread from Taodeng brigade to the entire commune. Some people who didn't believe it came to Lü Jingxin's experimental field and had nothing to say. In the face of the facts, people changed their minds. By March 6th, all eight brigades of the commune were involved in the rice transplanting upsurge.

Before the full-scale start of rice transplanting, Lü Jingxin noticed the issue of popularizing rice transplanters. By early March, more than 130 rice transplanters had been manufactured in the entire commune, and more than 300 rice transplanter operators had been trained. However, when it came to fully promoting the use of rice transplanters, some cadres shook their heads and said: "Rice transplanters look light and handy, but they are not easy to use. Some people threw them away after using them for a few days. It is a bit difficult to fully promote them." Lü Jingxin had his own views. He thought that rice transplanters are new things, and at the beginning, they would always encounter difficulties. It is necessary to mobilize the masses in depth and find ways to overcome difficulties in order to fully promote their use. He decided to grasp this work well.

Lü Jingxin, together with office secretary Lu Tingfang and women's director Zhao Guifang, went to the Dadeng production team and saw that many rice transplanters were discarded on the ridges of the fields, but the female commune members preferred to bend over and transplant rice seedlings by hand. After they inquired, they found out that at the beginning, the commune members scrambled to use rice transplanters, but after transplanting a few times, there were phenomena such as missing seedlings, hooking seedlings, floating seedlings, and injuring seedlings, so everyone was unwilling to use them. Lü Jingxin felt that he had to get his hands dirty and find out the problems in using rice transplanters. So, he carried a rice transplanter to the field and started transplanting. Because it was his first time operating, he only wanted to work hard, and the phenomena of injuring seedlings, missing seedlings, and being crooked and out of line were even more serious than when the commune members operated.

In the evening, Lü Jingxin convened five rice transplanter operators who had studied in the rice transplanter operator training class to study the problems of using rice transplanters. Some of them said that the specifications and quality of the rice transplanters were not good enough, some said that the users did not understand the operating technology, and some said that it was because the fields were not harrowed evenly... The fundamental problem could not be found. The forum was held until 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, and he tossed and turned all night and couldn't sleep well. The next day, before dawn, he put on his raincoat and ran to the field in the rain to fiddle with the rice transplanter. This time, he didn't just rely on working hard like the day before. He transplanted for a while, then stopped and carefully observed and pondered. Gradually, he discovered that the more flat and even the seedling boxes and seedlings on the rice transplanter were, and the more appropriate the number of seedlings stacked, the more neat and orderly the transplanted seedlings would be. He also found that the better the right hand grasped the seedling-clamping handle and coordinated with the steps of moving forward or backward, the more evenly and upright the transplanted seedlings would be; the less force was used to operate the handle, the fewer seedlings would be injured. It turned out that the problem was still with the operating technology.

Then, Lü Jingxin held an on-site meeting on the use of rice transplanters in this brigade. While introducing his experience and lessons learned from not knowing how to use rice transplanters to being relatively skilled in using them, he also performed for everyone to see. Everyone saw that the rice transplanted by Lü Jingxin using rice transplanters was even, in rows, upright, and had few injured seedlings. They all said it was easy to use, especially the women who happily said: If Secretary Lü hadn't pointed out the problem to us, we would have gone back. After the on-site meeting, all 130 rice transplanters in the commune were put into use. The daily progress of rice transplanting increased from more than 50 mu to 300 to 400 mu.

The implementation of rational close planting has had several years of experience. But, has everyone's ideological problem been solved? Lü Jingxin paid attention to this issue and found that some cadres' views on close planting were not unified enough. Some advocated the denser the better, and some still advocated planting 8×8 large-plant sparse planting. He convened cadres, old farmers, technicians, and young commune members to discuss this issue together, and calculated an account for those who advocated the denser the better and those who were preparing to adopt the 8×8 specification: Overly dense planting would not catch up with the season, and at the same time, there would not be enough sunlight, and it would not be able to grow, and the fertilizer would not be able to keep up, which would inevitably reduce production; 8×8 was too sparse to ensure increased yield per unit area. The result of the discussion was that over-dense and too sparse planting could not increase production. The unanimous opinion was to adopt 6×4 and 6×5 specifications according to the soil fertility. In order to adhere to the implementation of rational close planting, Lü Jingxin also mobilized everyone to take measures at all levels: the commune established an acceptance team, and the production team set up inspectors to go deep into the fields to check and implement the planting of one piece and the acceptance of one piece. Thanks to the forceful measures and the tight grasp at all levels, the transplanted rice fields were very good. (Attached picture)

    党委书记在春插中
    广西日报记者  黄英勤
    深夜两点钟，来宾县陶邓公社党委第一书记吕景新，才从县委开会回来。他骑了四十多公里的自行车，非常疲倦，真该躺下好好睡一会。可是，他想起在县委会上所讨论的对春耕生产要抓早抓好，各公社你追我赶那股热劲，许多问题接连涌上心头。他感到当前关键性的一着是抢上季节，适时插秧。但是，怎样才能打好这一仗呢？当前准备工作做得怎样了呢？……想起这些，他就连夜赶到公社的重点陶邓大队去了。想不到，重点队的社员，也还是按老皇历办事，将近3月了，这里还没有插秧的动静。队长覃英汉还带着些满意的口气说，过去小农经济时代一些种地的旧习惯已经改掉许多了，今年许多事都比过去搞得快，往年到清明才种秧田，可是今年现在秧苗已经长高了，田也犁耙放肥了。可是谈到插秧，他却摇摇头说：“天太冷，马上插秧搞不得。”吕景新意识到怕天冷是当前开展插秧的一个重要思想障碍，光凭口讲是难以说服大家的，便决定自己先动手，做出个样子看。
    3月1日，细雨绵绵，吕景新开始在他的试验田里插秧了。他把过多的田水排去，只留下大约半寸深的水，再均匀地撒上一层保温肥，然后按照6×4的规格，每蔸七苗，插下了秧苗。秧苗插下后，每天细心观察天气的变化，如遇雨天，半夜里也跑到田里去灌水；白天太阳出来了，又马上排干田水。过了四、五天，秧苗已经扎根，变得一片油绿，不但没有冻坏，还长高了一寸。
    这件事很快从陶邓大队传遍了全公社。有些人本来不大相信的，来到吕景新的试验田一看，也没有话说了。人们在事实面前，改变了自己的想法。到3月6日，公社的八个大队全部卷入插秧高潮。
    在插秧全面开始前，吕景新就注意到推广插秧机的问题了。到3月初，全公社已制成插秧机一百三十多部，插秧机手也训练出了三百多名。可是一提起全面推广使用插秧机，有的干部就摇头说：“插秧机，看起来轻巧，用起来不好办，有人用了几天就丢开了，全面推广有点难。”吕景新却有自己的看法，他想，插秧机是新事物，一开始，总会碰到困难的，要深入发动群众，想办法克服困难，才能全面推广使用起来。他决心抓好这项工作。
    吕景新和办公室秘书陆庭芳、妇女主任赵贵芳，到了大邓生产队，看见不少插秧机丢放在田埂上，女社员们却宁愿弯腰曲背地用手插秧。他们一打听，原来开始时，社员们争着使用插秧机，可是插不几下，便出现了漏秧、钩秧、飘秧、伤秧现象，于是大家就不愿用了。吕景新觉得必须自己动手摸一摸使用插秧机当中的问题。于是，他搬了一架插秧机下田，插了起来。因为他是第一次操作，光想用力猛干，伤秧、漏秧、歪扭不成行的现象，比社员们操作时还要严重。
    晚上，吕景新召集了曾在插秧机手训练班学习过的五个插秧机手，研究使用插秧机的问题。她们有的说是插秧机的规格质量不够好，有的说是用的人不懂操作技术，也有的说是因为田耙得不平整……根本问题到底在哪里还是找不着。座谈会开到深夜十二时，当晚他翻来复去睡不好，第二天没等天亮，他就披上蓑衣，顶着雨跑到田里摆弄插秧机了。这次，他不像前一天那样只凭猛干了，插一会，就停下来，仔细地观察琢磨。渐渐地他发现：插秧机上的秧箱和秧苗放得愈是平整，秧苗堆放数量适当，插下的秧就愈是齐整成行。他还发现：右手掌握夹秧柄，和前进或后退的脚步配合得好，插下的秧苗就均匀挺直；轻轻使用操作把，不用猛力，伤秧就很少。原来问题还是出在操作技术上。
    接着，吕景新在这个大队召开了使用插秧机现场会，他一边介绍自己由不会使用插秧机到使用得比较熟练的经验教训，一边表演给大家看。大家看到吕景新用插秧机插的秧均匀，成行，直立，伤秧少，都讲好用，特别是妇女们高兴地说：要不是吕书记把问题给我们指出来，我们又要走回头路了。现场会后，全公社一百三十多部插秧机全部使用起来了。每日插秧进度由五十多亩增加到三、四百亩。
    推行合理密植，已经有了几年的经验。但是，是不是每个人的思想问题都解决了呢？吕景新注意了这个问题，发现有些干部对密植的看法还不够统一，有的主张越密越好，有的仍然主张插8×8大株疏植。他召集干部、老农、技术员、青年社员，一起讨论了这个问题，分别给主张越密越好和准备采用8×8规格的人算了一笔账：过密了抢不上季节，同时阳光不足，不能发蔸，施肥赶不上，必然减产；8×8太疏，不能保证提高单位面积产量。讨论的结果是过密和太稀都不能增产，一致的意见，是要按田土肥分情况分别采用6×4、6×5的规格。为了坚持推行合理密植，吕景新又发动大家层层采取措施：公社成立验收小组，生产队设立验收员，深入田间检查，实行插一块，验收一块。由于措施有力，层层抓紧，插下的秧田都很好。（附图片）
