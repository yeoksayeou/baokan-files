    Clear Reservoir Bottoms to Facilitate Fish and Shrimp Catching
    The natural conditions of reservoirs are very suitable for fish farming. To ensure high and abundant fish production in reservoirs and to facilitate fishing, the following two tasks must be done well:
    1. Do a good job of clearing the reservoir bottom. The experience of fish farming in the Fozi Ridge, Guanting, and Banqiao Reservoirs shows that if the bottom of the reservoir is not cleaned before water storage, the trees, foundations, bridges, culverts, and earthen embankments at the bottom of the reservoir will be obstacles to fishing, affecting the rate of fish harvesting. Therefore, doing a good job of cleaning the reservoir bottom is one of the basic constructions for developing reservoir fishery production.
    The clearing of the reservoir bottom can have different requirements depending on the size of the reservoir. For large and medium-sized reservoirs, the location and scope of the fishing area should be determined and cleared according to the migration, habitat patterns, and seasonal aggregation points of fish. For small reservoirs where the clearing project is not large, a full reservoir clearing operation can be carried out in areas below the normal water level of the reservoir. The work of clearing the bottom of the reservoir includes: after the houses in the original residential areas are demolished, the walls should be pushed down and leveled, and the large and small trees should be sawn off on the spot; earthen dikes, tombs, and village enclosures should also be flattened. If the leveling of large areas of tombs or earth mounds is too large a project, they can be dug into wave shapes to create gentle slopes that are conducive to net operations. Isolated large buildings such as river dams, castles, and bridge piers can be left uncleared, but markers should be established in appropriate locations for identification during fishing.
    2. Take good anti-escape measures. In some reservoirs without fish blocking equipment or with imperfect equipment, the phenomenon of fish escaping is very serious. Therefore, before stocking fish in reservoirs, fish blocking equipment should be installed near the reservoir hub, upstream of the reservoir, and in the branch ditches along the reservoir. Small reservoirs can choose fish blocking equipment made of bamboo mats or galvanized wire mesh according to the size of the reservoir's flow and velocity, adapting to local conditions. For large reservoirs with deep water and large flow rates, fish blocking barriers that are both for removing debris and blocking fish, and that are electrically powered or operated by gantry cranes, can be installed near the dam, or electric fish barriers can be used.

    便于捕捞鱼虾
    要做好水库清底
    水库的自然条件，非常适合养鱼。要保证水库养鱼高额丰产，以及便于捕捞，必须做好下面两项工作：
    一、做好水库清底工作。佛子岭、官厅、板桥等水库养鱼的经验证明，水库在蓄水前，库底如不经过清理，库底的树木、房基、桥涵、土堤等是捕鱼的障碍物，影响成鱼的起水率。因此，做好库底清理工作，是发展水库渔业生产的基本建设之一。
    水库库底的清理工作，可根据水库的大小不同有不同的要求。大型、中型水库要根据鱼类回游、栖息的规律和季节性集结的地点，确定捕鱼区的位置、范围，进行清理。清理工程不大的小型水库，可对水库正常水位以下的地区作全库性的清理工作。清理库底的工作包括：原来居民点的房屋，拆掉以后，墙壁应推倒整平，大小树就地锯平；土堤埂、坟墓、村屯围埝，也应该摊平。大片坟墓或土岗如果摊平工程太大，可以扒成波浪形有利于网具作业的缓坡。对孤立的大型建筑物如拦河坝、城堡、桥墩等，可以不做清理，但要在适当的地点，建立标志，以便在捕捞时识别。
    二、要做好防逃措施。有些无拦鱼设备或设备不完善的水库，逃鱼的现象很严重。因此，水库养鱼在放养以前，水库枢纽附近、水库上游及库边支沟应设置拦鱼设备。小型水库可根据水库流量、流速的大小，因地制宜地选择竹箔、铅丝网的拦鱼设备。大型水库由于水深、流量流速大，可在水坝附近设置用电气或用门式起重机活动的除污、拦鱼两用的拦鱼栅，或者用电拦鱼。　王国嵪
