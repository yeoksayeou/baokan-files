    Strive for Advancement, Not Delay, and Exceed the Transportation Plan
    The first quarter of 1960 is coming to an end. The excellent situation of the continued leap forward in the national economy during the first quarter has once again made us realize how significant the role of transportation, a crucial link, plays in promoting and guaranteeing the high-speed and sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production when leaders at all levels grasp it from the very beginning. The old convention of declining transportation volume at the beginning of the year, which had existed for many years, has been broken, and a new convention of balanced production and high-speed operation has emerged. This is a good start for the continued and comprehensive leap forward in transportation this year and an important guarantee for the sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    Due to the widespread development of the nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the speed of leap forward in all walks of life is very fast, and the tasks facing the transportation sector are becoming increasingly heavy. The national steel production front has launched a competition to complete the steel production plan ahead of schedule, requiring transportation workers to deliver more coal, pig iron, and ore to steel enterprises in a timely manner; after the technical innovation movement is carried out and production capacity is improved in other industrial sectors, they also put forward more and greater requirements for the supply of raw materials; the comprehensive development of spring plowing and spring planting in the vast rural areas, the agricultural machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds urgently needed for spring production, as well as various building materials and materials needed for farmland water conservancy and drought resistance, all require transportation upon arrival; basic construction, commercial trade, and other aspects also have many materials to be transported. That is to say, the tasks of the transportation sector are heavier than in the past, and it must actively prepare its forces to meet the needs of the current continued leap forward in the national economy.
    How can we undertake the heavy tasks that are greater in each quarter? The key lies in establishing the idea of striving for advancement, not delay, and first grasping the completion of the current transportation tasks. Resolutely overfulfill the transportation plan and never be in arrears. Transportation has always been known as the vanguard. However, to truly be a worthy vanguard, one must have the determination to transport as much goods as there are and to transport them whenever they are needed. Failure to do so will have an adverse impact on production and construction. The production tasks of industry and agriculture always come one after another. If the transportation tasks that should be completed in this quarter are not completed and are dragged into the next quarter, the "burden" will become heavier and heavier over time, and the work will become increasingly passive. According to past experience, the fourth quarter of each year is a quarter with a particularly large volume of transportation. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, that industrial production reaches its peak in the fourth quarter, and agricultural production is a season of harvest; on the other hand, some transportation tasks that should have been completed in the previous quarters were not completed in time and were dragged into the fourth quarter, which increased the burden on the fourth quarter. This year's transportation work must establish the idea of striving for advancement, not delay. Tasks that should be completed in the spring must never be delayed until the summer, and those that can be transported in advance must not be delayed lightly. The reason why the overall transportation tasks in the first quarter of this year were completed well is mainly because party committees and transportation departments at all levels grasped them early and tightly and made preparations in advance. Learning from the experience of the first quarter, we must grasp each step tightly. For the transportation sector, only by grasping each step more tightly than the previous one can it be possible to turn temporary initiative into longer-term initiative; for the production sector, only if transportation is more and earlier at each step can the continuous rise of production be reliably guaranteed.
    What should we focus on? The "one-dragon" transportation collaboration and the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling are the two central links to fully exploit the existing transportation potential. To ensure that the transportation tasks are completed well, we must grasp these two central links well. At present, the "one-dragon" transportation collaboration promoted by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications has achieved great results, setting off a nationwide mass movement to vigorously promote "one-dragon" transportation collaboration, striving to achieve the "dragon network" of national transportation within a certain period. This is the main link in transportation organization work. Grasping this link can drive the leap forward in the overall transportation organization work and transportation collaboration and rapidly improve transportation capacity. Transportation headquarters at all levels should regard organizing and realizing "one-dragon" transportation collaboration as their central work, regularly supervise and inspect, and summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner. Transportation departments at all levels should incorporate "one-dragon" into monthly and daily shift transportation plans, establish special dispatching, and organize its realization. Vigorously engaging in the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling in terms of technical equipment is an important link to give full play to the power of "one-dragon" transportation. Because in the transportation process, the work of the "junction" between the transportation department and the production department, between various different transportation tools, that is, the links such as loading, unloading, transshipment, collection, distribution, and transfer, is still relatively weak. Modern transportation tools are not adapted to the manual labor of loading, unloading, and handling, which not only affects the improvement of transportation efficiency but also occupies a large amount of labor force. The phenomenon of vehicles and ships "running in the middle and nesting at both ends" is still relatively common. This is the greatest potential of the transportation sector at present. Since the beginning of this year, many provinces and cities have set off a high tide of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading. Many manual operations have been replaced not only by indigenous machines, indigenous equipment, and various combinations of indigenous and foreign equipment created by the workers and masses, but also some mechanized linkage operation lines or assembly lines for loading and unloading and handling have appeared, giving "one-dragon" transportation a reliable material basis. We must vigorously promote the existing innovation experience and integrate the technical innovation and technical revolution in transportation organization work and technical equipment, and push the comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution of transportation loading and unloading to a higher stage.
    Of course, to fundamentally solve the weak link of transportation, it is also necessary to seize transportation construction and strive to establish a well-connected transportation network in our country, mainly based on modern transportation tools, in the shortest possible time. Our country has a vast territory, but the density of existing railways and highways is still very small, and the existing modern transportation tools and various folk transportation tools are far from meeting the needs of production and transportation development. We need to vigorously engage in mass movements, carry forward the communist style of daring to think and act, break superstitions, and do everything possible to build more railways, highways, and waterways in the shortest possible time, and increase the production of more locomotives, automobiles, ships, and various folk transportation tools. In transportation construction, on the one hand, we must ensure the completion of the state's railway and highway construction tasks and give full play to the potential of modern transportation tools; on the other hand, we must strive to build indigenous and simple railways, highways, and transportation tools. The former is the backbone, but this backbone cannot be built on a large scale in a very short period due to the limitation of funds and equipment. However, the construction of indigenous and simple railways, highways, and transportation tools is an important auxiliary force for modern transportation tools and an important way to develop transportation at high speed. At present, the biggest problem in the transportation of large factories and mining enterprises is that short-distance transportation is not connected. Therefore, vigorously building small foreign railways and indigenous railways is particularly important.
    Comrades of the vast number of workers and staff on the transportation front! Although the transportation tasks in 1960 are very arduous, the new situation we face is very good. In the first quarter, the overall transportation tasks were completed very well. Only a few departments did not complete them well enough. In the second quarter, if we push the mass movement of "one-dragon" transportation collaboration and technical innovation and technical revolution to a new peak, the tasks in the second quarter will be completed even better.

### 赶前不赶后，超额完成运输计划

    赶前不赶后，超额完成运输计划
    1960年的第一个季度快过去了。第一季度国民经济继续跃进的大好形势，使我们再一次认识到，各级领导部门一开始就抓紧运输这一重要环节，对于工农业生产高速度地持续跃进，起着多么重大的促进和保证作用。多少年来存在的年初运量下降的老常规打破了，均衡生产和高速度运行的新常规出现了。这是今年运输事业继续全面跃进的良好开端，是工农业生产持续跃进的重要保证。
    由于全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动的广泛开展，各行各业跃进的速度很快，摆在交通运输部门面前的任务越来越大。全国钢铁生产战线上掀起了提前完成钢铁生产计划的竞赛，要求运输职工把更多的煤炭、生铁和矿石及时送到钢铁企业；其他工业部门当技术革新运动开展、生产能力提高以后，对于原材料的供应也提出更多更大的要求；广大农村春耕春种工作的全面展开，春季生产急需的农业机械、化肥、农药、种子，以及农田水利、抗旱斗争所需的各项建筑器材和物资，都要求随到随运；基本建设、商业贸易等方面也都有许多待运的物资。这就是说，交通运输部门的任务比过去更加繁重了，必须积极准备力量，才能适应当前国民经济继续跃进的需要。
    怎样才能承担起一个季度大于一个季度的繁重任务呢？关键在于树立赶前不赶后的思想，首先抓紧完成当前的运输任务。坚决超额完成运输计划，决不欠账。交通运输一向有先行官的称号。但是，要名副其实地当好先行官，就要有决心作到有多少货运多少货，要什么时候运就什么时候运。不这样做，就会给生产和建设带来不利的影响。工农业的生产任务总是一个紧接着一个来的，如果这一个季度应该完成的运输任务没有完成，拖到下一个季度，长此下去，“包袱”越背越大，工作就越来越被动。根据往年的经验，每年第四季度是运量特别大的一个季度，追究原因，一方面因为第四季度的工业生产达到高峰，农业生产是丰收季节；另一方面，有些本来应该在前几个季度完成的运输任务没有及时完成，拖到了第四季度，加重了第四季度的负担。今年的运输工作必须树立起赶前不赶后的思想，该在春季完成的任务决不拖到夏季，能提前运输的决不轻率地拖后。今年第一季度整个的运输任务所以完成得好，主要由于各级党委和运输部门早抓、紧抓，提前做好了准备。吸取第一季度的经验，那就要一步抓紧，步步抓紧。对于运输部门来说，只有一步抓得比一步紧，才有可能由一时的主动变为较长期的主动；对于生产部门来说，只有运输得一步比一步多，一步比一步早，生产的步步高升才有可靠的保证。
    主要抓什么呢？“一条龙”运输大协作和装卸搬运的机械化半机械化，这是充分发挥现有运输潜力的两个中心环节，要保证运输任务完成得好，就要把这两个中心环节抓好。目前，铁道部和交通部推行的“一条龙”运输大协作已取得了很大的成效，掀起一个全国性的大搞“一条龙”运输大协作的群众运动高潮，争取在一定时期内，实现全国运输的“龙网化”，这是运输组织工作的主要环节，抓住这一环，就能带动全盘运输组织工作和运输大协作的跃进，迅速提高运输能力。各级运输指挥部应该把组织实现“一条龙”运输大协作，作为自己的中心工作，经常督促检查，及时总结交流经验。各级运输部门要把“一条龙”纳入月度和日班运输计划，建立专门调度，组织实现。在技术装备上大闹装卸搬运的机械化半机械化，这是发挥“一条龙”运输威力的一个重要环节。因为在运输过程中，运输部门与生产部门之间，各种不同运输工具之间的“结合部”的工作，即装、卸、换装、集散、中转等环节还比较薄弱，现代化运输工具与装卸搬运的手工劳动不相适应，不仅影响运输效率的提高，还占用大量劳动力，车船“跑在中间，窝在两头”的现象还比较普遍，这是当前运输部门最大的潜力所在。今年以来，许多省市掀起了装卸机械化半机械化的高潮，许多手工操作，不仅为职工群众创造的土机器、土设备和各种土洋结合的、洋的设备所代替，而且出现了一些装卸搬运机械化的联动作业线或流水线，使“一条龙”运输有了可靠的物质基础。我们要大力推广已有的革新经验，把运输组织工作上和技术装备上的技术革新、技术革命结成一体，把运输装卸的全面技术革新、技术革命推向一个更高的阶段。
    当然，要从根本上解决交通运输这一薄弱环节，还需要抓紧交通建设，争取在尽可能短的时期内在我国建立起以现代化交通工具为主的四通八达的交通运输网。我国幅员辽阔，而现有的铁路和公路的密度还很小，已有的现代化交通工具和各种民间运输工具，远远满足不了生产运输发展的需要。我们需要大搞群众运动，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义的风格，破除迷信，千方百计地争取在尽可能短的时间内修建更多的铁路、公路和航道，增产更多的机车、汽车、船舶和各种民间运输工具。在交通建设中，一方面要保证完成国家的铁路和公路建设任务，并充分发挥现代化交通工具的潜力；另一方面要努力搞土的、简易的铁路、公路和交通工具。前者是骨干，但这种骨干，由于资金和设备的限制不可能在很短的期间大量地建设，而兴建土的、简易的铁路、公路和交通工具，则是现代化交通工具的重要辅助力量，是高速度发展交通运输的重要途径。当前，大型厂矿企业运输的最大问题，是短途运输衔接不上，因此，大搞小洋铁路和土铁路更特别重要。
    运输战线上的广大职工同志们！1960年的交通运输任务虽然是很艰巨的，但是我们面临的新形势是很好的。在第一季度，整个的运输任务完成得很好，只有个别部门完成得还不够好，在第二季度，把“一条龙”运输大协作和技术革新、技术革命的群众运动推向新的高峰，第二季度的任务就会完成得更好。
