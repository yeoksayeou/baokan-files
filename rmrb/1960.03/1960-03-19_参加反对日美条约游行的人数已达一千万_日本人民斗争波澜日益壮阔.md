Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 18th: On the eve of launching the 13th National Unified Action, the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" convened a national representative meeting of joint struggle organizations in Tokyo today. The meeting decided on an action plan for the movement against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Secretary-General of the National Council, Hirozo Mizuguchi, reported at the meeting that the number of people participating in marches against the new "Security Treaty" in various prefectures has reached ten million; joint struggle organizations in various places are working hard to collect signatures against the new "Security Treaty," and the number of signatures will exceed the National Council's target of ten million. He expects that by the end of March, the number of local joint struggle organizations against the new "Security Treaty" will develop to two thousand.

In his report, Mizuguchi Hirozo emphasized the importance of April for the struggle against the new "Security Treaty." He said that in order to win the struggle, workers' strikes, the struggles of progressive members of the Diet, and mass actions by people from all walks of life must maintain close ties.

The representative meeting made specific decisions on future activities: between April 1st and 7th, the 14th National Unified Action against revising the "Security Treaty" will be held, and between April 15th and 21st, the 15th National Unified Action will be held, and the entire movement will culminate in the 15th Unified Action.

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, forwarding it to the National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty," warmly supporting the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the Japanese people in their 13th Unified Action to prevent the ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and further abolish it, and once again expressing sincere respect to the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the Japanese people who are persevering in their heroic struggle.

The telegram said, "Your struggle has thoroughly exposed the war and aggression plots of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, making them more isolated in the eyes of the Japanese people and the people of the world, severely hitting the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and making a significant contribution to the cause of national democracy in Japan and to peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese workers are very pleased with these great achievements of the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the Japanese people.

"Recently, Kishin Suke said in his Diet reply that 'the Far East includes Jinmen and Matsu,' which nakedly reveals the heinous ambitions of the Japanese militarists who have continuously carried out aggression against China for decades and committed countless crimes, and once again exposes that the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' is an aggressive military alliance treaty. This fully shows that U.S. imperialism and Kishin Suke are the common enemies of the workers and people of China and Japan. The Chinese workers will work together with the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the Japanese people to fight to the end to completely smash the war and aggression plots of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

"Behind the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the Japanese people is the support of thousands of workers and people all over the world. The times have undergone fundamental changes. The Chinese workers firmly believe that no matter what tortuous paths the struggle of the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the Japanese people may experience, they will overcome all obstacles and achieve final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The National Women's Federation today sent a telegram to the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations, forwarding it to the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," supporting the 13th Unified Action of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, saying: "With the signing and implementation of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Japan will bear more and more military obligations for the United States' aggressive policies, and is at risk of being dragged into a new war at any time. For the Japanese people, this means: the military burden will become heavier and heavier, fascist rule will be imposed, women will once again be forced to send their husbands and sons to the battlefield to make futile sacrifices, and even the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will be repeated. For the Chinese people and the people of Asia, this means that peaceful life will once again be seriously threatened and disrupted. Therefore, Chinese women and all Asian women cannot ignore this. The large-scale unified actions launched time and time again by women from all walks of life in Japan together with the Japanese people have powerfully countered the aggressive war plots of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and made great contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. Chinese women, the Chinese people, and all the people of Asia are cheering for you. Although there are still many difficulties on your path of struggle, we believe that with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, your struggle will surely achieve final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Japan Democratic Youth League and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," representing Chinese youth and students, expressing full support for the Japanese people and youth in holding the 13th National Unified Action against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The telegram said, "The increasingly large-scale struggle launched by the Japanese people and youth against the Japan-U.S. military alliance has powerfully exposed and attacked the aggression and war plots of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and has made important contributions to safeguarding the national interests of Japan and defending the cause of peace in Asia and the world. We sincerely congratulate you on the significant achievements you have already made, and wish you even greater victories in your just struggle for national independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality."

"We firmly believe that no force can stop the victorious advance of the Japanese people who are united and persist in struggle. The perverse actions of the Kishin Suke government will surely be completely defeated, and U.S. imperialism will surely be driven out of its own country by the Japanese people."

    参加反对日美条约游行的人数已达一千万
    日本人民斗争波澜日益壮阔
    我全总、妇联、青联、学联致电支持日本人民第十三次统一行动
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：在展开第十三次全国统一行动的前夕，阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天在东京召开了全国地方共同斗争组织代表会议。这次会议决定了反对日美“安全条约”运动的行动计划。
    国民会议事务局长水口宏三在会上报告说，目前各县参加反对新
  “安全条约”游行的人数已经有一千万；各地共同斗争组织正在努力征集反对新“安全条约”的签名，签名数字将超过国民会议所规定的一千万的指标。他预计到3月底，反对新“安全条约”的地方共同斗争组织将发展到两千个。
    水口宏三在报告中强调了4月份对反对新“安全条约”的斗争的重要性。他说为了赢得斗争的胜利，工人的罢工、进步国会议员的斗争和各阶层人民的群众行动必须保持密切的结合。
    代表会议对今后的活动作出了具体决定：在4月1日至7日之间，将举行反对修改“安全条约”的第十四次全国统一行动，在4月15日至21日之间将举行第十五次全国统一行动，并且在第十五次统一行动中使整个运动达到高潮。
    新华社18日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电日本工会总评议会转阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议，热烈支持日本工人和日本广大人民为阻止批准日美“安全条约”并进一步废除这个条约而举行的第十三次统一行动，并向坚持不懈进行英勇斗争的日本工人和日本广大人民再一次表示衷心的敬意。
    电报中说，“你们的斗争彻底揭露了美日反动派的战争和侵略阴谋，使它们在日本人民和全世界人民面前更加孤立，沉重地打击了美日反动派，为日本民族民主事业、为亚洲和世界和平作出了重大的贡献。中国工人为日本工人和日本广大人民的这些伟大成就感到非常高兴。
    “最近，岸信介在国会答辩中说‘远东范围包括金门和马祖’，这赤裸裸地揭示出几十年来对中国不断地进行侵略和犯有无数罪行的日本军国主义者的罪恶野心，又一次暴露了日美‘安全条约’是侵略性的军事同盟条约。这充分说明美帝国主义和岸信介是中日两国工人和人民的共同敌人。中国工人将和日本工人和日本广大人民一道，为彻底粉碎美日反动派的战争和侵略阴谋而共同奋斗到底。
    “日本工人和日本广大人民的背后有全世界千千万万的工人和人民的支持。时代已经发生了根本的变化。中国工人坚信，日本工人和日本广大人民的斗争无论经历任何曲折的道路，必将克服种种障碍，取得最后的胜利。”
    据新华社18日讯　全国妇女联合会，今天致电日本妇女团体联合会转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，支持日本人民为反对日美军事同盟条约举行的第十三次统一行动说：“随着日美军事同盟条约的签订和实施，日本将为美国的侵略政策负担越来越多的军事义务，随时都有被拖入新的战争的危险。对日本人民来说，这意味着：军费负担将愈来愈重，法西斯统治将被强加在头上，妇女们将再次被迫将自己的丈夫儿子送上战场做无谓的牺牲，甚至，广岛、长崎的惨剧将再次重演。对中国人民和亚洲人民来说，这意味着和平生活将再受到严重威胁和破坏。因此，中国妇女和全亚洲妇女对此不能置之不理。日本各阶层妇女和日本人民在一起展开的一次又一次的大规模统一行动，有力地回击了美日反动派的侵略战争阴谋，对保卫亚洲和世界和平事业做出了极大的贡献。中国妇女和中国人民以及全亚洲人民都为你们而欢呼。尽管在你们的斗争道路上还有许多困难，但是我们相信，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，你们的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。
    据新华社18日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天致电日本民主青年同盟并转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，代表中国青年和学生，表示全力支持日本人民和青年举行反对日美“安全条约”第十三次全国统一行动。
    电报中说，“日本人民和青年为反对日美军事同盟而掀起的声势越来越浩大的斗争，有力地揭露和打击了美日反动派的侵略和战争阴谋，对维护日本民族利益和保卫亚洲与世界和平事业，作出了重要的贡献。我们衷心祝贺你们已经取得的重大成就，并且预祝你们争取民族独立、和平、民主和中立的正义斗争，获得更大的胜利。”
    “我们坚信，任何力量都无法阻挡团结起来坚持斗争的日本人民的胜利前进。岸信介政府的倒行逆施必将遭到彻底的惨败，美帝国主义必将被日本人民赶出自己的国土。”
