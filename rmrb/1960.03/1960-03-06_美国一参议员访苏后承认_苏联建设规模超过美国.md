Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 27th (TASS dispatch): Morse, a member of the US Senate delegation for studying the experience of Soviet hydroelectric station construction, praised the Soviet Union's construction in the field of hydropower when speaking at the National Association of Agricultural Electric Cooperatives conference.

Morse and his companions visited the Soviet Union last autumn. Morse pointed out that the Soviet Union not only built the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station in such a short period of time, but is now building the Angara, Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric stations and other huge hydroelectric stations whose energy greatly exceeds that of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. He specifically mentioned that the power generation capacity of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station is almost double that of all thirty-one hydroelectric stations on the Tennessee Valley in the United States.

Morse said that he also saw the enormous progress made by the Soviet Union in the construction of long-distance transmission lines in the past two years. He emphasized that the members of the Senate delegation reached the following unanimous conclusion: "The Russians have only been engaged in water conservancy and power engineering for about thirty years, and they have caught up with other countries in the technical aspects of water conservancy and power construction projects, and have surpassed them in many specific aspects. They have great perseverance to realize their plans, and build water conservancy and power projects at a much greater speed than the United States."

Morse also talked about the huge scale of housing construction in the Soviet Union.

Morse admitted that he found no reason to doubt that the potential of the Soviet "existing system can smoothly continue the development of industry." He said that he had visited the Leningrad electrical equipment factory, which produces half of the world's electric generators and transmission equipment; while twenty years ago, most of this equipment came from the United States and Western Europe. He emphasized: "This fact itself shows how tremendous changes have taken place in the industrial situation in the East and the West."

In addition, Morse also introduced the situation of education and cultural life in the Soviet Union. He said that everyone in the Soviet Union is reading now, and "books are very cheap and well-printed. A large number of publications—various engineering and technical books (rather than detective novels with various covers like in the United States)—are sold at three-quarters cheaper than here."

    美国一参议员访苏后承认
    苏联建设规模超过美国
    新华社讯　据塔斯社华盛顿2月27日讯：美国参议院研究苏联水电站建设经验代表团成员摩斯在美国农业电气合作社全国协会会议上讲话时，对苏联水电方面的建设表示赞叹。
    摩斯和他的同伴们在去年秋天访问了苏联。摩斯指出，苏联不仅在如此短促的期间内建成了世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站，而且现在正在建设着其能量大大超过古比雪夫水电站的安加拉、布拉次克、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站及其他一些巨大的水电站。他特别提出，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的发电能力几乎要超过美国田纳西州河谷上所有三十一个水电站的一倍。
    摩斯说，他还看到苏联最近两年在长距离架设输电线方面取得的巨大的进步。他着重指出，参议院代表团成员得出了下列的一致结论：“俄国人经营水利动力工程总共才有三十年左右，他们就以水利动力建设工程的技术方面赶上了其他国家，而且在许多具体的方面超过了它们。他们有巨大的毅力实现自己的计划，并且比美国以大得多的速度建立水利动力工程”。
    摩斯还谈到苏联在住宅建设方面的巨大规模。
    摩斯承认，他没有找到任何理由怀疑苏联“现存制度的潜力能够顺利地继续工业的发展”。他说，他参观过列宁格勒的电力电工器材工厂，这个工厂生产着世界上半数的电动发电机和输电设备；而在二十年以前，这种设备大多数是来自美国和西欧的。他强调说：“这一事实本身表明，在东西方的工业状况中发生了多么巨大的变化。”
    此外，摩斯还介绍了苏联的教育和文化生活状况。他说苏联现在人人都在阅读，那里“书籍很便宜，印刷得也很好。大批的出版物——各种各样的工程技术书籍（而不是像美国那些有形形色色的封面的侦探小说），售价比我们这里便宜四分之三。”
