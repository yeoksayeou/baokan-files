A Farce
\tBy Our Staff Commentator

\tThe South Korean presidential "election" held under the bayonets of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique has concluded. Syngman Rhee, with the support of the United States and the extremely barbaric methods he adopted, has once again been re-elected as "President." This was not an election, but a farce of corruption, terror, and violence.

\tOriginally, under the fascist rule of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, the South Korean people could not even speak of having any basic democratic freedoms, let alone any right to elect or be elected. The "elections" held in South Korea have always been merely a public performance of the Syngman Rhee clique vying for power and profit with another group of American lackeys. This presidential "election," like the previous ones, saw the Syngman Rhee clique use the full range of fascist and rogue tactics to maintain its rule. First, according to the pseudo-"constitution" manufactured by Syngman Rhee himself, the election of this "President" was originally scheduled for July 15, but Syngman Rhee suddenly announced that it would be brought forward to March 15, so that he could gain the upper hand while the opposition party was unprepared. At the same time, starting from March 12, special martial law was implemented throughout South Korea, with large numbers of police and military police taking to the streets to threaten voters. A large number of police were also deployed at the election sites, forcing voters to vote for the Syngman Rhee clique. Prior to this, the Syngman Rhee clique also secretly ordered the police to create "ghost" voter lists, putting bundles of "supporting votes" accounting for more than 40% of the votes into the ballot boxes, requiring the police to ensure that Syngman Rhee would receive more than 85% of the votes. Assassinations and violent acts and other bloody incidents emerged one after another. Syngman Rhee's main opponent, Democratic Party "presidential candidate" Cho Byung-ok, "suddenly died" in Washington on February 15, resulting in a ridiculous play of Syngman Rhee "competing" with a dead man. Syngman Rhee's agents openly broke into local Democratic Party offices, beating its leaders to death with iron bars; they seized the campaign documents of the "Democratic Support League," making it impossible for it to nominate a "presidential" candidate. All public places were controlled by the Syngman Rhee clique's Liberal Party, preventing the Democratic Party from giving campaign speeches. According to statistics, at least eleven people were beaten to death in this "election," and countless were injured. Even U.S. news agencies had to admit that "violent acts" had occurred throughout South Korea, making it "a bloody election."

\tProbably even the United States felt that this farce was performed too excessively, causing the master to lose face. U.S. State Department spokesman White had to issue a statement on March 14 saying that the United States "regretted" certain actions in the South Korean presidential "election." How strange! Hasn't the United States always boasted that South Korea is a "free country," that South Korean elections are "free elections," and insisted on expanding this "free election" to the entire Korean peninsula? But even the U.S. State Department itself "regrets" this kind of "election," so how valuable is this so-called "freedom"? Of course, the United States' dissatisfaction with the Syngman Rhee clique is only the dissatisfaction of a master with his servant, only because the Syngman Rhee clique did things too poorly. However, despite its dissatisfaction, the United States has always used various methods to support this most reactionary, most corrupt, and most barbaric puppet group it created. Not long ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Parsons made such a statement. He also said that if the United States does not support "free countries" like the Syngman Rhee clique, these "countries" will not be able to survive. This is indeed the case! Without the protection of U.S. bayonets, the Syngman Rhee clique would not be able to survive for a day. In other words, without U.S. support and U.S. colonial rule over South Korea, there would be no puppet rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, and of course, there would be no "bloody elections" manufactured by Syngman Rhee. Ultimately, the crimes of the Syngman Rhee clique are also the crimes of U.S. imperialism. So, who should the United States express "regret" to? Can the U.S. State Department's expression of "regret" to Syngman Rhee conceal U.S. support for Syngman Rhee and U.S. aggression against South Korea? This can only be self-deception. Recently, Eisenhower openly claimed that "it is ridiculous to say that the United States supports dictators." In fact, what is truly ridiculous is Eisenhower himself!

\tHowever, no matter how the United States supports the Syngman Rhee clique for the purpose of aggression and war preparation, the Syngman Rhee clique's situation in South Korea is still getting worse and worse. The South Korean people's opposition to U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee clique, is rising daily, the political crisis of the Syngman Rhee clique is deepening, and his small court is becoming increasingly unstable. This situation is even reflected to some extent in this "election." Despite the Syngman Rhee clique mobilizing all its forces and exhausting all fascist suppression and various despicable means, the number of votes obtained by the Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party candidates was still far from the numbers it expected. And the South Korean people rose up in protest before the "election" was even over, shouting "the election is invalid." South Korea's opposition parties have issued statements condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's election as illegal and invalid. A demonstration of thousands of people erupted in Masan against the Syngman Rhee clique's manufacturing of the "election." Of course, this is only part of the South Korean people's opposition to the U.S.-Rhee reactionary rule. The barbarous rule and enslavement of the South Korean people by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique for many years cannot but arouse the anger and resistance of the people. Since the beginning of this year, the South Korean people's struggle against the cruel exploitation and fascist rule of the U.S.-Rhee has developed to all levels of workers, peasants, students, and citizens; from Jeolla South Province and Jeolla North Province to Gyeonggi Province and North Chungcheong Province, from Busan, Daegu, Incheon to Suwon and Daejeon, flames of resistance have been ignited in many places. The reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea is built on a volcano. One day, this volcano will erupt.

    一出丑剧
  　本报评论员
    在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的刺刀下举行的南朝鲜总统“选举”，已经收场了。李承晚凭借美国的支持以及他所采取的极端野蛮的手段，再次连任“总统”。这并不是什么选举，而是一出营私舞弊、恐怖和暴力的丑剧。
    本来，在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的法西斯统治下，南朝鲜人民根本就谈不上有任何最起码的民主自由，更谈不上有任何选举和被选举的权利。南朝鲜所举行的“选举”从来只是李承晚集团同美国的另一批奴才之间争权夺利的一种公开表演。这一次总统“选举”，同前几次一样，李承晚集团为了维持它的统治权，使出了法西斯和流氓的全套本领。首先，根据李承晚自己制造的伪“宪法”，改选本届“总统”原应在7月15日举行，但李承晚却突然宣布提前到3月15日，以便于他在反对党准备不及的情况下占居上风。同时，从3月12日开始，南朝鲜全境就实行特别戒严，大批警察、宪兵出动街头，对选民进行威胁。选举场所也部署大量警察，逼使选民必须投李承晚集团的票。在此以前，李承晚集团还密令警察制造“幽灵”选民名单，把占选票40％以上的“支持票”成捆地放入票箱，要警察保证李承晚能得到85％以上的票。暗杀和暴力行动等血腥事件层出不穷。李承晚的主要对手民主党“总统候选人”赵炳玉2月15日在华盛顿“突然死去”，于是出现了一场李承晚同死人“竞选”的滑稽戏。李承晚的特务公然闯进民主党地方党部，用铁棍打死它的领导人；抢夺“民主拥护联盟”的竞选文件，使它根本无从提出“总统”候选人。一切公共场所都被李承晚集团的自由党所把持，不让民主党发表竞选演说。据统计，在这场“选举”中被打死的至少有十一个人，被打伤的不可胜计。连美国通讯社也不得不承认，在南朝鲜各地都发生了“暴力行动”，这是“一场流血的选举”。
    大概连美国也觉得这幕丑剧表演得太过份了，丢了主人的脸。美国国务院新闻发布官怀特不得不在3月14日发表谈话说，美国对南朝鲜总统“选举”当中的某些行动“感到遗憾”。多么奇怪！美国不是经常吹嘘南朝鲜是“自由国家”，南朝鲜选举是“自由选举”，而且坚持主张把这种“自由选举”扩大到整个朝鲜吗？可是，居然连美国国务院自己也对这种“选举”“感到遗憾”，那末这种所谓的“自由”的价值究竟有多大，可想而知。当然，美国对李承晚集团的这种不满，不过是主人对奴才的不满，不过是因为李承晚集团把事情办得太不漂亮了而已。可是，不满尽管不满，美国对于它所制造的这个最反动、最腐朽、最野蛮的傀儡集团却始终是用各种办法加以支持的。不久以前，美国助理国务卿帕森斯就作过这样的表示。他并且说，如果美国不支持像李承晚集团这样的“自由国家”，这些“国家”就无法生存下去。事实的确如此！离开了美国刺刀的保护，李承晚集团一天也活不下去。换句话说，没有美国的支持，没有美国对南朝鲜的殖民统治，也就没有李承晚集团的傀儡统治，当然也就没有李承晚所制造的这种“流血的选举”。归根结底，李承晚集团的罪恶，也就是美帝国主义的罪恶。那么，美国究竟应该向谁表示“遗憾”呢？美国国务院对李承晚表示“遗憾”，难道就可以掩饰美国对李承晚的支持和美国对南朝鲜的侵略吗？这当然只能是自欺欺人。最近，艾森豪威尔公然声称，“说美国支持独裁者，是荒唐可笑的”。其实，真正荒唐可笑的，恰恰是艾森豪威尔自己！
    但是，不管美国为了侵略和备战的目的，对李承晚集团怎样加以支持；李承晚集团在南朝鲜的处境却仍然是越来越不妙了。南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团的情绪逐日高涨，李承晚集团的政治危机更加深化，他的小朝廷已经日益不稳了。这种形势，甚至在这次“选举”中也得到某种反映。尽管李承晚集团动员了它的全部力量，使尽了法西斯镇压和各种卑鄙手段，李承晚的自由党候选人所得的票数仍然同它预期的数字相差很远。而南朝鲜人民当“选举”尚未结束时就奋起抗议，高呼“选举无效”。南朝鲜各在野政党纷纷发表声明，谴责李承晚集团的选举是非法的和无效的。马山市爆发了反对李承晚集团制造“选举”的数千人大示威。当然，这还仅仅是南朝鲜人民反对美李反动统治的一部分表现。美国和李承晚集团多少年来对南朝鲜人民的野蛮统治和奴役，不能不激起人民的愤怒和反抗。今年以来，南朝鲜人民反对美李残酷压榨和法西斯统治的斗争已经发展到工人、农民、学生和市民各阶层；从全罗南道、全罗北道到京畿道、忠清北道，从釜山、大丘、仁川到水原和大田，许多地方都燃起了反抗的火焰。美帝国主义和李承晚集团在南朝鲜的反动统治，是建立在火山之上的。总有一天，这个火山是要爆发的。
