U.S. Rice Dumping in Asia

Striving to Seize the Thai Market

The massive dumping of rice in Asia by the United States has severely impacted Thailand's rice trade.

According to Thai newspaper reports, Thailand's rice trade will face a greater crisis this year under the competition from U.S. rice. Thai government officials, business figures, and newspaper commentators have recently made speeches and published articles, criticizing the United States for seizing Thailand's rice market through various means.

According to official Thai statistics, under the competition from U.S. rice, Thailand's rice exports last year were only over 1.07 million tons, setting the lowest rice export record in the past five years.

According to Bangkok newspaper reports, the United States will dump another 700,000 tons of rice in Asia this year. The U.S. government has notified Thai authorities that the first batch of rice will amount to 90,000 tons.

Thai newspapers report that due to the decrease in Thai rice exports, domestic rice stocks have increased (approximately 150,000 tons). Thailand's rice trade has fallen into a state of depression this year, with rice exporters and importers and rice mills complaining about the sluggish business conditions. Nai Sanchuk, Chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, told the press on February 6 that the dumping of rice in Asia by the United States would inevitably affect the sales of Thai rice. He said that the prospects for Thailand's rice trade this year are indeed not optimistic.

However, those currently most affected are the Thai farmers, who account for about 80% of the national population. Due to the sharp drop in grain prices (the price of every 2,000 liters of grain has fallen by 300-400 baht), Thai farmers, especially the general poor farmers, have suffered heavy losses, and their lives have fallen into despair. Many poor farmers have been forced by life to sell their draft cattle, on which they depend for their livelihoods. Thai farmers have written letters to the government complaining and requesting relief.

Thai newspapers have also published commentaries criticizing the United States for dumping rice and seizing Thailand's rice market. "Siam Mass News" said on the 11th that no matter what form the United States uses to dump rice around the world, it will certainly cause countries like Thailand, Burma, and Cambodia, which produce rice, to encounter a serious economic crisis in the near future.

"Free Communication News," "Thai Daily," and "Honor News" have also published consecutive commentaries expressing dissatisfaction with the U.S. dumping of rice and demanding that the United States stop seizing Thailand's rice market.

According to Bangkok newspaper reports, the Thai cabinet had no choice but to recently decide to authorize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to hold negotiations with the U.S. government to prevent the United States from seizing Thailand's rice market.

    美国大米倾销亚洲
    竭力争夺泰国市场
    美国在亚洲大量倾销大米，已严重地影响到泰国的大米贸易。
    据泰国报纸报道，在美国大米的竞争下，泰国今年的大米贸易将面临更大的危机，泰国政府官员、商界人士和报纸舆论最近纷纷发表谈话和评论，指责美国以各种方式抢夺泰国的大米市场。
    据泰国官方发表的统计数字，在美国大米的竞争下，去年泰国大米的输出量只有一百零七万多吨，创最近五年来大米输出的最低纪录。
    据曼谷报纸报道，美国今年还将向亚洲倾销七十万吨大米。美国政府已通知泰国当局，其中首批大米将达九万吨。
    泰国报纸报道，由于泰国大米输出减少，国内存米增加（约有十五万吨）；今年泰国大米贸易已陷入萧条状态，经营大米的出入口商和碾米厂都诉苦说商情不景气。泰国商会主席乃搧祝2月6日对报界说，美国在亚洲倾销大米，必然会影响泰国大米的销路，他说，今年泰国大米贸易前途实在不容乐观。
    但是，目前受打击最大的还是约占全国人口80％的泰国农民，由于谷子价格暴跌（每二千公升的谷子的价格已下跌了三、四百铢），使得泰国农民特别是一般贫农遭到惨重损失，生活陷入绝境，许多贫农被生活所迫，只得将相依为命的耕牛卖掉。泰国农民纷纷写信向政府诉苦，并且要求给予救济。
    泰国报纸也纷纷发表评论，指责美国倾销大米抢夺泰国大米市场。“暹罗群众报”11日说，不管美国用什么形式在世界各地倾销大米，都肯定会使泰国、缅甸和柬埔寨等这样一些产米国在不久将来遭遇严重的经济危机。
    “自由通讯报”、“泰日报”和“荣誉报”也连续发表评论，对美国倾销大米的做法表示不满，并且要求美国停止抢夺泰国大米市场的做法。
    据曼谷报纸报道，泰国内阁也不得不在最近决定授权外交部和经济部同美国政府举行谈判，以阻止美国抢夺泰国的大米市场。
