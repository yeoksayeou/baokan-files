Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd. The Soviet "Naval Gazette" today published a commentary entitled "Japan Becomes the Pentagon's Strategic Base," stating that Japan is now an unsinkable aircraft carrier for the United States and the most important base for atomic air force attacks against the Soviet Union and China.

The commentary said that a fundamental measure taken by the U.S. military authorities to achieve the above goal is to extensively establish air force, naval, and rocket bases in Japan, and to build warehouses for atomic and other weapons. Currently, there are more than 50,000 U.S. military personnel stationed on Japanese soil, with 750 aircraft from the U.S. Fifth Air Force, 100 airfields, and 20 air force bases available for U.S. use. In addition, the United States is constantly transporting various rocket weapons to Japan and has established launch sites. The majority of the U.S. Seventh Fleet also uses Japanese ports as its base.

The commentary said that the United States is trying every means to revive the Japanese armed forces. According to official Japanese admissions, Japan will possess 1,100 aircraft and 150 warships this year. The construction plan for new warships is being stepped up, Japan is accelerating the construction of submarines, and most of the military technical equipment of the Japanese armed forces is supplied by the United States. U.S. monopoly capital is fattening itself on these, while also turning Japan into its arsenal.

The commentary pointed out that the United States has also turned Okinawa Island into a strategic base and claims that the island is its most powerful overseas fortress.

The commentary said that the new Japan-U.S. military treaty ultimately turned Japan into the main strategic base for the United States in the Far East.

The commentary concluded by criticizing the policies pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke government, stating that these policies hinder the easing of international tensions and cause concern among peace-loving people.

    苏联“海军报”评日美军事条约
    美国把日本作为进攻苏中基地
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联“海军报”今天在一篇题为“日本成为五角大楼的战略基地”的评论中说，日本现在是美国的不沉的航空母舰，是进攻苏联和中国的原子空军的最重要的基地。
    评论说，美国军事当局为要达到上述目的而采取的一个基本措施是在日本广泛建立空军、海军和火箭基地，建立原子及其他武器的仓库。现在，在日本国土上已驻有五万多名美国军事人员，有美国第五航空队的七百五十架飞机，有供美国使用的一百个机场和二十个空军基地。除此之外，美国还将各种火箭武器不断运往日本，并建立了发射场。美国第七舰队绝大部分也以日本港口为基地。
    评论说，美国正千方百计使日本武装力量复活。据日本官方供认，今年内，日本将拥有一千一百架飞机和一百五十艘军舰。新军舰的建造计划正在加紧执行，日本正在加紧制造潜水艇，日本武装力量的大部分军事技术装备都由美国供应。美国垄断资本靠这些养肥了自己，同时又把日本变成自己的军火库。
    评论指出，美国把冲绳岛也变成了战略基地，并自称这个岛是它的一座最强大的海外堡垒。
    评论说，日美新军事条约最终把日本变成了美国在远东的主要战略基地。
    评论最后还抨击岸信介政府所执行的政策，它说，这种政策妨碍着国际紧张局势的缓和，引起爱好和平人民的忧虑。
