Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Providing sufficient and high-quality raw materials for light industry is a crucial issue for achieving sustained leaps forward in China's light industry. Since last year, the light industry sector has found a way to establish raw material bases, which can play a significant role in resolving the problem of raw material supply for the continued leap forward in light industry.

Recently, under the leadership of the State Council's Finance and Trade Office, the Ministry of Light Industry, in close cooperation with relevant departments such as agriculture, state farms, grain, forestry, and commerce, jointly established specialized groups for papermaking, leather, sugar and tobacco, oil and wine, and handicrafts, responsible for studying the raw material supply and the establishment of raw material bases for these industries. Many provinces and cities' light industry departments are also cooperating with agriculture and commerce departments under the unified leadership of the local Party committees to plan and link with people's communes, starting the establishment of various raw material bases during the spring ploughing season. Liaoning and Hebei are preparing to establish reed bases for the papermaking industry, while Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan are to establish bamboo forest bases. Guangdong, Sichuan, and Jilin are establishing bases for Masson pine and poplar for papermaking pulp mills. According to the "southern sugarcane and northern beet" characteristics of sugar industry raw materials, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Fujian, and Yunnan will appropriately expand the area planted with sugarcane this spring, while also supplying more high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to the existing sugarcane bases to increase yield per unit area. Heilongjiang Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will further expand existing beet bases and establish some new key points. According to local climatic conditions, Nanping Prefecture in Fujian Province has generally established cassava bases this spring for brewing raw materials. Fifteen key egg product factories in Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and other provinces are promoting the experience of the Jincheng Egg Product Factory in Shanxi in establishing thousand-chicken farms and ten-thousand-chicken mountains, and are establishing chicken farming bases. Canned food industries in various provinces have decided to promote the experience of the Xiamen Cannery and establish raw material bases for vegetables, fruits, and poultry.

Establishing raw material bases has many benefits. According to the experience of Xiamen Cannery, Jianyang Winery in Fujian, and Jincheng Egg Product Factory in Shanxi last year, establishing raw material bases can first rapidly increase raw material output and promote the high-speed development of light industrial factory production. Last year, the Jincheng Egg Product Factory in Shanxi, based on the principle of "water has a source, trees have roots, to get eggs, raise chickens first," cooperated with people's communes to establish dozens of thousand-chicken farms and ten-thousand-chicken mountains, which played a significant role in solving the problem of raw material supply for the egg product factory. Secondly, it facilitates factories providing some assistance to people's communes in terms of technical guidance, funds, varieties, and chemical fertilizers, so that the quality of raw materials and yield per unit area are greatly improved. After Xiamen Cannery established a raw material base linked with people's communes, it sent experienced technicians to reside in the communes to assist in solving technical problems such as seedling cultivation, and taught fruit seedling cultivation, harvesting, and vegetable planting techniques through training classes and on-site field meetings. Now the cucumbers, tomatoes, and other vegetables and fruits supplied by the communes can meet the factory's requirements. Thirdly, factories and raw material bases are closer in distance, which can shorten transportation mileage and save transportation capacity. For example, although Jianyang Winery in Fujian is not a very large winery, it used to transport more than one million catties of grain from other places every year as raw materials. Last year, this factory cooperated with local people's communes to establish a cassava base and used cassava instead of grain for brewing, which saved a lot of transportation capacity and saved a lot of grain for the country.

80% of China's light industrial raw materials (including the textile industry) come from rural areas. Therefore, the development speed of light industry is closely related to the production of agricultural cash crops. After the communization of rural areas throughout the country, agricultural production became more planned and realized diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The output of various cash crops has surged, providing more raw materials for light industry and promoting the possibility of light industry developing at an unprecedented high speed. For example, in 1959, edible vegetable oil increased by 17% compared with 1958, and machine-made paper increased by 40%. It is unprecedented in the history of capitalist development for light industrial products based on agricultural crops to develop at such a rapid rate. As China's light industry develops faster and faster, the need for various raw materials also increases more and more. Although the growth rate of agricultural cash crops is very large, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the high-speed development of light industry. At the same time, most of China's original light industrial factories are concentrated in the coastal areas, and these factories do not have their own raw material bases. The raw materials they need were transported from farther places in the past. This long-distance transportation has increased transportation costs and increased the country's transportation burden. Therefore, vigorously establishing light industry raw material bases is still an important issue at present. In order to fully utilize light industrial raw materials and accelerate the development of light industry, on the one hand, it is necessary to adopt a policy of combining large, medium, and small, with medium and small as the main, in the inland and remote areas to accelerate the construction of a large number of light industrial factories, so as to use local materials, sell them locally, and fully utilize local rich resources; on the other hand, it is necessary to widely establish various raw material bases near the original light industrial factories in the coastal areas. In this way, light industry can be close to the raw material production areas and obtain relatively sufficient raw materials nearby. This is of great significance for giving full play to the production potential of the original light industrial enterprises and ensuring that China's light industry achieves high-speed development.

    使工厂接近原料产地　使原料产量迅速增长
    各地建立轻工业原料基地
    工农商协作，工厂和公社挂钩，趁春耕季节及早进行规划和建设
    新华社8日讯　为轻工业提供充足而优良的原料，是当前我国轻工业实现持续跃进的关键问题。去年以来，轻工业部门找到建立原料基地的办法，对解决轻工业持续跃进的原料供应问题，可起很大作用。
    最近，轻工业部在国务院财贸办公室领导下，和农业、农垦、粮食、林业、商业等有关部门进行大协作，共同成立了造纸、皮革、糖烟、油酒、手工业等专门小组，负责研究这些行业的原料供应和建立原料基地的问题。许多省市的轻工业部门也在当地党委的统一领导下，和农业、商业部门协作规划，并且和人民公社挂钩，趁春耕季节着手建立各种原料基地。辽宁、河北准备为造纸工业建立芦苇基地，四川、江西、湖南要建立竹林基地，广东、四川、吉林为造纸木浆厂建立马尾松和杨木基地。根据制糖工业原料的“南蔗北菜”特点，广东、广西、四川、福建、云南今春将适当扩大种植甘蔗的面积，同时为原有的蔗糖基地供应更多的优良种子、化肥和农药，来提高单位面积产量。黑龙江省和内蒙古自治区则将进一步扩大原有甜菜基地和建立一些新的基点。福建省南平专区根据当地气候条件，今春普遍建立了酿酒用原料——木薯基地。河南、山西、江苏等省十五个重点蛋品厂，推广山西晋城蛋品厂建立千鸡场、万鸡山的经验，正在建立养鸡基地。各省罐头工业决定推广厦门罐头厂的经验，建立蔬菜、水果、家禽等原料基地。
    建立原料基地的好处很多。根据厦门罐头厂、福建建阳酒厂、山西晋城蛋品厂去年的经验，建立原料基地首先能迅速增加原料产量，促进轻工业工厂生产高速度发展。山西晋城蛋品厂，去年根据“水有源、树有根、要蛋先养鸡”的道理，和人民公社合作，办起了几十个千鸡场和万鸡山，对解决蛋品厂原料供应问题起了很大作用。其次，便于工厂在技术指导、资金、品种、化学肥料等方面给予人民公社一些帮助，使原料的质量和单位面积产量大大提高。厦门罐头厂与人民公社挂钩建立原料基地后，派有经验的技术人员驻在公社，协助解决育苗培植等技术问题，通过开训练班、田间现场会议等办法，传授水果育苗、采摘和种植蔬菜的技术。现在公社供应的黄瓜、番茄等蔬菜和水果，都能合乎工厂的要求。第三，工厂和原料基地距离较近，可以缩短运输里程，节省运输力。譬如，福建建阳酒厂虽然是一个不太大的酒厂，但过去每年要从外地调运一百多万斤粮食作原料。去年这个厂和当地人民公社协作建立木薯基地，用木薯代替粮食酿酒，既节省大量运输力，又为国家节约大量粮食。
    我国轻工业原料（包括纺织工业）80％来自农村。因而轻工业的发展速度和农业经济作物的生产，关系极为密切。全国农村公社化以后，由于农业生产更加有计划，并且实现了农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营，各种经济作物产量激增，为轻工业提供了更多原料，促使轻工业有可能以空前高速度发展起来。如1959年食用植物油比1958年增长17％，机制纸跃增40％。以农作物为原料的轻工业产品，以这样快的速度发展，是世界资本主义发展史上所没有过的。随着我国轻工业发展的步伐愈来愈快，需要的各种原料也愈来愈多。农业经济作物增长的幅度虽然很大，也还不能完全满足轻工业高速度发展的需要。同时，我国原有轻工业工厂大多集中在沿海一带，这些工厂都没有自己的原料基地，所需要的原料过去都是从较远地方调运。这种长途运输既增加了运输费用，又增加了国家的运输负担。因此，大力建立轻工业原料基地在目前仍是一个重要问题。为了充分利用轻工业原料和加速轻工业发展，一方面需要在内地和边远地区采取大中小结合以中小为主的方针，加快兴建大批轻工业工厂，以便就地取材，就地销售，充分利用当地丰富的资源；另一方面，要在沿海原有轻工业工厂附近，广泛建立各种原料基地。这样就可以使轻工业接近原料产地，就近得到比较充足的原料。这对充分发挥原有轻工业企业的生产潜力和保证我国轻工业得到高速度发展，有着十分重要的意义。
