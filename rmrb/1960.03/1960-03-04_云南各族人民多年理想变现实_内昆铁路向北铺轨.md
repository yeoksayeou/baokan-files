Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 3rd: The southern section of the Neikun Railway, the first heavy-rail railway that the people of Yunnan have longed for for decades, began laying tracks northward from the Kunming Hub Station on the 1st.

　　More than 3,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Kunming City came to the hub station early that day to participate in the track-laying ceremony with joy and excitement. Many young women from the Yi, Hani, and other ethnic groups wore national costumes and sang and danced on the flat roadbed.

　　Zhou Chipping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guo Chao, Secretary of the Secretariat and Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, and representatives of other relevant agencies attended the track-laying ceremony. Guo Chao spoke at the ceremony on behalf of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee, and the people of Yunnan Province.

　　The Neikun Railway starts in Neijiang, Sichuan, in the north and ends in Kunming, Yunnan, in the south, with a total length of 830 kilometers. It passes through the Wumeng Mountains, which the Red Army passed through during the Long March. It is one of the few plateau railways in China. The length of bridges, tunnels, and culverts on the entire line accounts for about two-fifths of the total length of the railway, and the earthwork per kilometer reaches 200,000 cubic meters. The difficulty of the project exceeds the world-famous Baoji-Chengdu Railway. At present, the northern section has been opened to traffic from Neijiang to Anbian, where Sichuan and Yunnan provinces meet. The southern section from Kunming to Xuanwei, 239 kilometers, was started in 1958, and all tunnel, bridge, and earthwork projects were completed in sixteen months.

　　Yunnan is located in the southwest border of the motherland, and transportation has always been inconvenient. People in the past only knew that "the road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to the blue sky," but they did not know that the road to Yunnan was even more difficult than the road to Shu. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan have long hoped for a railway to connect with the rest of the country. After the Neikun Railway is completed, Yunnan can be connected to the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu Railways, leading to the Northwest and North China. After the Dianqian Railway, which is under construction, is opened to traffic, it can also be connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou, Xiang-Gui, Xiang-Gan, and other railways via Guiyang and Qian-Gui in the east, reaching Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou directly. The ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan for many years has become a reality under the socialist system.

### 云南各族人民多年理想变现实  内昆铁路向北铺轨

    云南各族人民多年理想变现实
    内昆铁路向北铺轨
    据新华社昆明3日电　云南人民盼望了几十年的第一条重轨铁路——内昆铁路南段，1日开始从昆明枢纽站向北铺轨。
    昆明市三千多名各族各界人民，在当天一早就来到枢纽站上，以欢欣鼓舞的心情参加了铺轨典礼。许多彝族、哈尼族等青年妇女穿上民族服装，在平坦的路基上面载歌载舞。
      中共云南省委书记处书记周赤萍，书记处书记、云南省副省长郭超，以及中国人民解放军驻昆明部队的代表和其他有关机关的代表，都参加了铺轨典礼。郭超代表中共云南省委和云南省人民委员会和云南全省人民，在典礼大会上讲了话。
    内昆铁路北起四川内江，南迄云南昆明，全长八百三十公里。中途要经过当年红军长征时经过的乌蒙山脉，是我国有数的高原铁路之一。全线的桥梁、隧道、涵洞的长度，约占铁路总长度的五分之二，每公里的土方工程达二十万方，工程的艰险超过了举世著名的宝成铁路。目前，北段已从内江通车到四川同云南两省交界的安边。南段从昆明至宣威二百三十九公里，是1958年动工修建的，开工十六个月就完成了全部隧道和桥梁和土方工程。
    云南偏处祖国的西南边疆，交通历来不便。人们过去只知道“蜀道之难难于上青天”，殊不知，滇道比蜀道更难。因此，云南各族人民长期以来就希望有一条铁路和全国相接联系起来。内昆铁路修通以后，云南就可以同成渝、宝成铁路相联，通往西北和华北；正在加紧施工的滇黔铁路通车以后又可以东经贵阳和黔桂、湘桂、京广、湘赣等铁路相联，直达北京、上海和广州。云南各族人民多少年来的理想，在社会主义制度下变成了现实。
