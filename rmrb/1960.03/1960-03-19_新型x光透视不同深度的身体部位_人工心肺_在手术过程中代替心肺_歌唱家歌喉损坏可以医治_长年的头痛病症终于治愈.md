    New X-ray 透视 Different Depths of Body Parts
    “Artificial Heart-Lung Machine” Replaces Heart and Lungs During Surgery
    Singer's Voice Damage Can Be Treated
    Long-Term Headaches Finally Cured
    Soviet scientists have designed a new type of tomographic X-ray machine that can take five pictures at once, each showing five different depths of the part of the human body being studied.
    Using this X-ray machine, the radiation dose received by the patient is much smaller than when using an ordinary tomographic X-ray machine. This tomographic X-ray machine can help doctors make better diagnoses. The new X-ray machine is horizontal and fixed, and can take photos of two different sizes.
  The Kiev X-ray Equipment Factory will produce the first batch of new tomographic X-ray machines this year.

    Soviet scientists have created a new "artificial heart-lung machine" for use during surgery. It is simple in structure, easy to use, and requires much less supplemental blood than similar machines last year.
    The new "artificial heart-lung machine" was designed under the leadership of Professor Amosov, a famous Kiev surgeon and thermal engineer, and can replace the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. It only requires supplementing half a liter of blood during use, while some current "artificial heart-lung machines" require 1.5 to 3 liters. A large amount of mixing with foreign blood is medically very unfavorable.
    On March 10, this device underwent clinical trials in Kiev and was used in a complex heart operation on a nine-year-old child. During the operation, it replaced the child's heart and lungs for sixteen minutes. The operation was very successful.

    In the Soviet Union, hospitals for treating vocal cords have now been opened in Boly, Chelyabinsk, Leningrad, Gorky, Minsk, and other large cities.
    The famous Soviet physician Petrov played a huge role in creating methods for treating vocal cords. In his youth, he graduated from both a music school and a medical school. The combination of these two areas of knowledge enabled him to find the cause of vocal cord damage in singers. In 1928, the Soviet Union established the world's first dedicated laboratory for research.
    The results determined that vocal cord damage in singers is caused by nerve concussion, brain disorders, and functional damage. After years of research, Petrov finally found a treatment method.

    A hospital in Sverdlovsk recently cured a strange headache. The patient was discharged from the hospital after recovering from surgery.
    The patient, Barsukov, was an artillery soldier who had frequent headaches as a child, which became chronic headaches after joining the army. Neurologists tried all methods of treatment without success. Finally, X-ray photography revealed a sewing needle in the lower parietal region of the patient's brain. It seems that the needle was inserted through the fontanelle in the patient's infancy. The needle caused constant inflammation of the brain tissue, resulting in headaches. After two and a half hours of complex surgery, the needle was removed.

    歌唱家歌喉损坏可以医治
    长年的头痛病症终于治愈
    苏联科学家设计了一种新型的层析X射线机，它可以一次拍摄五张照片，五张照片分别照出人体内部被研究部分中五种不同深度的部位。
    使用这种X射线机，病人所受到的辐射剂量比使用普通层析X射线机要小得多。这种层析X射线机可以帮助医师更好地作出诊断。新的X射线机是水平的、固定式的，可以拍摄两种不同尺寸的照片。
  基辅x射线器材厂今年将生产出第一批新型层析X射线机。

    苏联科学家制成了一种在施行手术时使用的新的“人工心肺”。它的结构简单、使用方便，所需要的补充血数量比去年同类机械少得多。
    新的“人工心肺”是在基辅著名外科医生兼热力技术工程师阿莫索夫教授领导下设计的，在手术过程中能代替心和肺的功能。在使用时只需要补充半公升血，目前一些“人工心肺”需要一点五到三公升。而大量混入外来血在医疗上是极不利的。
    3月10日，这个器械在基辅进行了临床试验，在为一个九岁儿童作复杂的心脏手术时使用了。在手术期间，它代替儿童心肺工作了十六分钟。手术进行得很成功。

    在苏联的伯力、车里雅宾斯克、列宁格勒、高尔基、明斯克及其它一些大城市，现在都开办了医治歌喉的医院。
    在创立医治歌喉方法方面，苏联著名医师彼得罗夫起了巨大的作用。他在青年时代曾经在音乐学校和医学院毕业。这两门知识的结合，使他找到了歌唱家歌喉损坏的原因。1928年苏联建立了世界上第一个专门实验室进行研究。
    结果确定，歌唱家歌喉损坏是因为神经震荡、大脑障碍和机能破坏。经过多年研究，彼得罗夫终于找到了治疗方法。

    斯维德洛夫斯克一家医院最近治好了一个奇怪的头痛病。病人经过手术后痊愈出院了。
    病人巴尔苏科夫是一位炮兵战士，年幼时即常患头痛，入伍后变成经常性头痛。神经科大夫用尽一切方法治疗无效。最后经X光照像发现，病人脑部前顶下有一根缝衣针。看来这根针是在病人的婴儿时期由顶门扎进去的。针引起脑组织的经常发炎而造成头痛。在经过两个半小时的复杂手术以后，针才被取了出来。
