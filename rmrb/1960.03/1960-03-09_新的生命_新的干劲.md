Shanxi Correspondence

    New Life, New Drive
    By our reporters Fan Yinhuai and Feng Dongshu

    Piece after piece of earth and stone collapsed from the mountain ridge. Then, the laborers, like soldiers charging, braved the pervasive dust and rushed forward, some shoveling, some pushing carts. At this moment, the technician standing on the mountain in front waved a red flag and shouted, "Comrades, another large area of bumper harvest!" Standing on this boiling construction site, one could not tell that those working here were the sixty-one class brothers who had been severely poisoned just over ten days ago.

    In late February, we traveled south from Taiyuan along the Datong-Puzhou Railway, crossed the torrential Yellow River, and traversed the towering mountains to arrive at Pinglu County in southern Shanxi. Here, an intense battle to save lives had just ended more than ten days ago, but the poisoned laborers had all recovered their health, and they were launching an intense labor competition. Walking into the construction site, sixty-one fiery hearts were radiating the brilliance of new life. As soon as they started work, they proposed: New life, new drive, splitting mountains and paving roads to be heroes, presenting gifts three months ahead of schedule. They arrived at the construction site every day before dawn and did not stop working until eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Wang Wenyue, the leader of the Zhanggou section of the Fengnan Highway, who led us to the construction site, pointed enthusiastically at the vigorous warriors and said to us, "Look, that young man pushing the cart is a tool innovation expert, and that one is the initiator of improving labor organization." Then he pointed to the old man shoveling soil on the mountain and said, "He is Liu Baoquan, who suggested adopting the large-area soil unloading method."

    Liu Baoquan's thin face was covered with wrinkles. He was not a cadre, but every day before dawn, he urged the young people to get up and go to work. At the construction site, whenever there was a break, he would discuss with everyone how to improve work efficiency and how to improve operations. He suggested using the mountain势 to unload soil over a large area. As a result, efficiency increased by more than double at once. Although Liu Baoquan was over half a century old, he worked no less hard than the young people. Even after he was poisoned, he worried that he would not be able to go to work the next day.

    Recalling those critical days, people deeply felt the kindness and warmth between people under the socialist system. On the day of the poisoning, when people felt hopeless, the Party Secretary of Zhangcun Commune led more than thirty doctors to the construction site overnight. The doctors gave injections for a while, washed clothes and dried quilts for the patients, drank mung bean water, and made them vomit all the poisonous food. In order to fundamentally remove the toxins, an air force unit airdropped medicines overnight the next day. Later, the laborers all said, "This is the medicine sent by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao." Now, as soon as people mention this sentence, a warm current surges through their hearts, and they gain strength when they work.

    When we visited old man Liu Baoquan, the first thing he said was, "Without the Party, we would have been long gone." Liu Baoquan originally fled from Henan Province to Pinglu County due to famine. Before liberation, he had been a farmhand for landlords. One year, he contracted malaria, and even when he was delirious with fever, he had to struggle to go to the fields. Even so, the landlord said he was faking illness and wanted to drive him out. He had also personally witnessed the tragic fate of his class brothers who worked with him, who were thrown into ditches by the landlord before they even died of illness. Liu Baoquan could not continue speaking here. After a while, he said, "This time the Party saved me, and I will repay Chairman Mao's kindness with outstanding achievements."

    Sixty-one new lives emitted sixty-one soaring drives. At the construction site, we heard a series of vivid stories of selfless dedication to building highways. When seventeen-year-old Wu Guangxin was poisoned, his father, Wu Jingxi, rushed all the way from Zhangdian Commune, eighty miles away, to the construction site to see him. As soon as he entered the hospital, the crowd of people visiting the patients blocked his view, and he could not find his son in the crowd for a while, which made him even more anxious. As soon as Guangxin saw his father, he hurried to greet him and said bluntly, "Dad, Chairman Mao has saved us. What are you doing coming so far? Look, County Chief Guo and the Party Secretary of the Commune have also come to see me. It's more reassuring than getting sick at home." When old man Wu Jingxi saw that Guangxin was still as strong and lively as before, he couldn't speak through his tears. At this time, a group of cadres and laborers surrounded him to comfort him. County Chief Guo shook his hand and said, "Old man, don't worry. In a socialist country, there is a home everywhere." In front of County Chief Guo, old man Wu Jingxi said to his son, "Guangxin, the Party is even closer than your own parents. You must listen to the Party and not go home until you have repaired the highway." The Party's concern and his father's encouragement gave Wu Guangxin infinite power. He asked to return to the construction site before his convalescence period was over. He said, "The Fengnan Highway is an artery of the whole county. If it is not repaired sooner, how can we support the Sanmenxia project when the Yellow River flood season comes and the old highway is destroyed?" This young man jumped up happily when he was approved to return to the construction site. As soon as he came back, he tried every means to find tricks. Originally, they were two people loading soil onto the car. Every time they loaded a car, they had to wait a long time before loading the next one. He felt that this was too slow, so he discussed with his workmates to put the soil basket close to the root of the soil pile and use three strands of rope to directly load the soil into the soil basket. Loading and pulling the soil was as fast as a relay race.

    The family comedy of Dong Haiguan and his wife is spreading on the construction site. The story is as follows: Dong Haiguan is a young man who usually only knows how to bury his head in work and rarely jokes with people. This time, he was severely poisoned. When he was just discharged from the hospital and ready to go to work, he received a letter from his wife saying that she had a stroke and wanted Dong Haiguan to go home and take a look. Haiguan felt that he should go back, and the leaders also advised him, but when he thought about the meticulous care he had received from the Party Committee and doctors after he was poisoned, and that the construction site was very tense, he carried his hoe and went to the construction site. The boiling construction site made him forget about this matter. Dong Haiguan did not expect his wife to get angry; it turned out that she was holding back her anger because she wanted to send Haiguan new shoes and socks. Haiguan knew that he had offended his wife, so he wrote a letter to persuade her: "I was poisoned at the construction site, and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao sent planes to save us. Think about it, without the Party, could we two still be together? Now that I am well, I have to hurry up and go to work to make up for the work we did not do during our recuperation. You have to know that one less day of work is fifteen cubic meters of soil less..." Sure enough, this letter moved his wife, and within a few days, she asked someone to bring the shoes and socks and wrote a letter congratulating Haiguan: "My illness has also been cured in the commune hospital. Don't worry! You can work hard at the construction site to repay the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao." At the construction site, we saw this young man full of energy, putting down his shovel and pushing the car. From his strong physique and red cheeks, we saw the vitality of youth shining all over him.

    The brilliance of communist thought has produced a huge force among the people of Pinglu County. We saw many laborers and commune members cherish a light bulb, a wooden board, and a medicine box used in the airdropped medicines as gifts from Chairman Mao. As soon as they see it, they feel full of energy. When we were in Pinglu, the people of the county, inspired by the high communist style of the people of the capital, were all engaged in the drought resistance movement. In order to support drought resistance, the industrial sector has rushed to manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery. The county machinery factory lacked wood for manufacturing waterwheels. Li Wensheng, chairman of the trade union, and master Ren Zi'an took out their bed boards to make waterwheels and slept on the ground themselves. The factory Party Committee Secretary was afraid of affecting their health and repeatedly dissuaded them. They said, "The air force and the people of the capital sent us medicine through the clouds and fog. What's so great about us not sleeping on bed boards for a while?" Here, we saw the Party's concern for the people and the communist spirit of cooperation being carried forward in people's minds. They dedicated their sincere hearts to the Party and to the magnificent socialist cause.

    新的生命  新的干劲
    本报记者　范银怀　冯东书
    一片片土方从山岗上塌落下来。接着，民工们像战士冲锋一样冒着弥漫的烟土冲上前去，攉土的攉土，推车的推车。这时，站在前方山头上的技术员挥舞着红旗高喊：“同志们，又一个大面积丰收！”置身在这沸腾的工地上，一点也看不出在这里劳动的就是十多天前曾经恶性中毒的六十一个阶级弟兄。
    2月下旬，我们从太原沿同蒲路南下，渡过滔滔的黄河，又翻过丛山峻岭，来到了山西南部的平陆县。这里，一场抢救生命的紧张战斗刚过去十几天，但是中毒的民工们已全部恢复了健康，他们正在展开紧张的劳动竞赛。走进工地，六十一颗火热的心，正在焕发着新生命的光辉。他们一上班就提出：新生命，新干劲，劈山开道称英雄，提前三月把礼献。每天不等天亮就到了工地，直到晚上八九点钟才收工。引我们来工地的风南公路张沟工段领导人王汶月同志指着一个个生龙活虎的战士热情地对我们说：“看，这个推车的小伙子是革新工具能手，那个是改进劳动组织的倡导人”。接着他指着正在山岗上攉土的老汉说：“他就是建议采用大面积卸土法的刘宝权。”
    刘宝权瘦小的面孔上布满了皱纹。他不是干部，可是每天天不亮，就四处催促青年人起床上班。在工地上一到歇工时就和大伙儿研究如何提高工效，怎样改善操作。他建议利用山势大面积卸土。结果，效率一下提高一倍多。刘宝权虽然年过半百，干起活来可一点也不比年青人差。直到中了毒，他还耽心第二天不能上工。
    回想在危急的日子里，人们深深地感到在社会主义制度下，人与人之间的亲切和温暖。在中毒的当天，当人们感到绝望的时候，张村公社党委书记带领着三十多名医生连夜赶到了工地。医生一会儿打针，一会儿给病人洗衣服晒被子，喝绿豆水，让有毒的食物都吐净。为了从根本上解除毒素，第二天空军某部又连夜空投了药品。后来，民工都说：“这是党中央毛主席送来的药。”现在，只要人们一提这句话，一股暖流就冲击着人们的心，干起活来，劲就来了。
    当我们访问刘宝权老汉的时候，他第一句话就说：“没有党早没有我们了。”刘宝权原来是从河南省逃荒到平陆县的。解放前一直给地主当长工，有一年他得了瘧疾症，人烧得昏昏糊糊的，还得挣扎着下地。就是这样，地主还说他装病要把他赶出大门。他还亲眼看到过和他一起扛长工的阶级弟兄没等病死就被地主抛到河沟里的惨事。刘宝权谈到这里再也说不下去了。停了一会说：“这次党挽救了我，我要用出色的成绩来报答毛主席的恩情。”
    六十一个新生命发出了六十一道冲天的干劲。我们在工地上听到一连串舍己为公赶修公路的生动事迹。十七岁的吴广新刚中毒时，他父亲吴敬喜一口气就从八十里外的张店公社赶到工地来看他。一进医院，慰问病人的人群，挡住了他的视线，他在人群中一时没有找到儿子，更加焦虑了。广新一看到父亲，赶忙迎上去，劈头一句就说：“爷，毛主席已把我们救活了，这么远你来干啥？你看郭县长、社党委书记也都来看我，这比家里得病还放心。”吴敬喜老汉看到广新，还跟原来那样壮实、活泼，含着眼泪说不出话来。这时，一群干部、民工都围到他身边安慰他。郭县长握住他的手说：“老大爷，你不要着急，在社会主义国家里到处是家。”吴敬喜老汉在郭县长面前对儿子说：“广新，党比你的亲生父母还亲，你要听党的话，不修好公路不要回家。”党的关切和父亲的勉励给了吴广新无穷的力量。他不到疗养期满就要求回到工地。他说：“风南公路是全县的一条动脉，不早些修好，黄河汛期一来，旧公路被冲毁，怎么能支援三门峡工程？”这位青年人被批准回工地时高兴得跳了起来。一回来，就千方百计找窍门。原来他们两个人往车上装土，每装一车，要等好久才装下趟车。他觉得这样太慢了，就和工友们研究，把土筐靠近土堆根，用三股绳直接往土筐里装土，装土拉土，像接力赛跑一样迅速。
    董海贯和他爱人的一场家庭喜剧，在工地上传诵着。事情的经过是这样的：董海贯是个青年小伙子，平常只知道埋头干活，很少与人开玩笑。这次中毒很重。他刚出院准备上工的时候，接到了爱人的来信说她中了风，要董海贯回家看一看。海贯当时觉得也应该回去一趟，领导上也劝过他，当他想起自己中毒以后受到党委和医生无微不至的照顾，而工地上又很紧张，就扛着镢头上了工地。沸腾的工地，使他忘记了这件事情，董海贯没想到爱人发了火；原来她说要给海贯寄的新鞋新袜憋着股气压下来了。海贯知道得罪了爱人，就写了一封信劝说道：“我在工地中了毒，党中央和毛主席派飞机救活了我们，你想，没有党我们俩还能在一起吗？现在我好了要赶快上工，把我们养病期间少干的活补起来，你要知道少干一天就少挖十五立方米土呀……”果然这封信打动了爱人，不过几天就托人把鞋袜捎来，并且写信祝贺海贯：“我的病也在公社医院治好了。你放心吧！你在工地好好劳动报答党和毛主席的恩情。”在工地上我们看到这个小伙子干劲十足，放下铁锹就推车。从他那健壮的体态和红红的脸蛋上看到浑身闪耀着青春的活力。
    共产主义思想光辉在平陆县人民中产生了巨大的力量。我们看到许多民工、公社社员都把空投药品中使用过的一个灯泡、一块木板、一个药盒都当成毛主席送来的礼物珍藏起来。一看到它，就觉得浑身是劲。我们在平陆时，全县人民在首都人民的高度共产主义风格鼓舞下，都投入了抗旱运动。工业部门为了支援抗旱，已赶制出排灌机械。县机械厂制造水车缺少木材，工会主席李文生、老师傅任子安把自己的床板腾出来做水车，自己睡在地下。厂党委书记怕影响他们身体，再三劝阻。他们说：“空军和首都人民曾穿云破雾给我们送药品，我们暂时不睡床板有啥了不起。”在这里，我们看到党对人民的关切和共产主义的协作精神在人们心目中发扬光大。他们把一颗颗赤诚的心献给了党，献给了壮丽的社会主义事业。
