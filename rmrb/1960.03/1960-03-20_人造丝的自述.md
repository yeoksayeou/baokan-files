The Autobiography of Rayon

My full name is viscose rayon, a branch of the chemical fiber family. We have many brothers and sisters, some from trees, grasses, cotton linters, others from coal, limestone, petroleum waste gas; some from corn cobs, rice husks, and a few from peanuts, soybeans, and milk. Although we all grow in different places and have our own names, people have turned us into a big family and call us all chemical fibers.

Our branch grows from trees in the high mountains and ridges of the motherland. Although people like us very much, we feel quite uneasy, always feeling that we have not made much contribution to socialist construction. The motherland's construction needs various materials, but we change back and forth into wood. I am really worried, and I want to transform into several kinds of materials needed for construction! One day, our family was discussing this matter when a worker, an old uncle, came with a group of young people, pointing at me with a smile and saying, "Great, choose them!" The young men pulled out electric saws and cut us down, then let us down the mountain along the ice track. I only heard a swishing sound in my ears, and before I could blink, I was pulled onto a train.

A few days later, we arrived at a paper mill, which was much more lively than the mountains! Everywhere there were busy crowds, and machines were singing loudly. I was so absorbed in watching that I slipped and fell into a crusher. Hey, this machine is really powerful; it tore us into crushed wood chips in a few moments. Then, we went into a very large pot filled with slippery water. We took a bath inside and felt much refreshed. Coming out of the pot, we became as soft and white as cotton. At this time, the workers sent us to a copper wire mesh, and we became sheets of snow-white paper pulp, no longer distinguishable from each other.

A few days later, the truck took us to the Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory. No wonder people say this is the first modern rayon factory in our country! As soon as we entered the factory, we took the elevator to the top floor of the raw liquid workshop. The workers put us into large troughs with iron gratings. I thought, "Probably another bath." Sure enough, the trough was also filled with alkaline water. Strangely enough, before the bath was finished, we all grew fatter, and our bodies felt like we had shed a layer of skin. It turned out that we had something called hemicellulose, which had to be removed with alkaline solution. I was about to climb out of the iron trough when the iron grating suddenly moved and pressed us flat again.

"Is the pulverizer on yet?" I heard someone ask.

"Okay, come on!" someone replied. "Oh my God! Are they going to pulverize us!" Before I could figure it out, I walked into a pair of grinding wheels, and in a moment, I turned into powder and fell into a large cylinder. There was no sunlight here, and it was very hot. As soon as we went in, the large iron cylinder spun around forcefully, and we kept somersaulting. With great difficulty, I rolled out and hurried forward. A girl in white came over and took me to the laboratory. After a while, she told the worker on duty, "It can be xanthated now, the degree of molecular polymerization is suitable for spinning raw materials!"

"This made me so happy; they are going to use me to spin yarn! This is the first time in our ancestors' lives!" I thought, "I should hurry up and move forward." Alas, it's not easy in this xanthation machine, with carbon disulfide and alkaline solution. Before long, I felt sticky all over. It turned out that I had mixed with everyone and become viscose!

After several filtrations, I followed the winding pipes to a small glass tube on the spinning machine. In front of the tube, there was something like a small top hat blocking my way. The brothers behind kept surging up, squeezing me so hard that I was about to shout. Before I could open my mouth, I involuntarily sprayed out from the small hole on top of the small top hat. To my surprise, in that instant, I had turned into thirty strands of fine silk, only a fraction of the thickness of human hair. As soon as I sprayed out, I shivered and felt a spicy taste in my nostrils. It turned out that I had fallen into an acid bath. Fortunately, just as I turned around in the water, the worker pulled me out and pulled me onto a roller, and I followed the roller in circles. Hey, I looked back and saw that our brothers and sisters had all become glittering rayon. We cheered and took a few more showers, changing from yellow to white. The workers wound us into skeins on a reeling machine. I saw myself shining all over, and my brothers and sisters also shining all over. We really became silk! We no longer had that stiffness, and as soon as the wind moved, we danced with it. I heard the engineer say that we are called ordinary rayon, which is used to weave silk and velvet. Sure enough, when I arrived at the silk mill, I went on the loom. The workers were especially kind to us, calling us "the first batch of rayon in the motherland!" I heard that the second phase of the Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory will start construction this year, and after it is completed, another brother of ours will be born. It is called high-tenacity rayon, which is specially used for industrial production and can be used to make automobile tire cord fabric, etc.

　　Let's go, brothers, let's go down the mountain together!
　　Workers from the chemical fiber factory came to welcome us!
　　We have all become skeins of silk with glittering bodies!

    人造丝的自述
    我的全名叫粘胶人造丝，是化学纤维家族中的一个分支。我们兄弟姊妹挺多，有的是树木、草类、棉籽短绒，有的是煤、石灰石、石油废气；有的是玉米芯、谷糠，还有少数是花生、大豆、牛奶，虽然我们都各自生长在一个地方，各有各的姓名，可是人们把我们变成了一个大家族，都叫化学纤维。
    我们这个分支是生长在祖国高山峻岭的树木。人们虽然十分喜欢我们，可是我们心里却挺不好过，总觉得自己对社会主义建设没有立下多少功劳。祖国建设需要各种物资，可我们变来变去还是木材，我真有点发愁，多想再变几种建设需要的物资啊！那天，我们一家正在议论这件事，一位工人老伯伯领着一帮小伙子来，笑呵呵地指着我说：“真棒，就挑它们！”小伙子们拉开电锯把我们锯倒，就顺着冰道放下山去。我只听见耳边唰地一声，还没有来得及眨眼，就被拉上火车了。
    过了几天，我们到了一家造纸厂，这儿可比山上热闹多啦！到处是忙碌的人群，机器轰隆隆地唱歌。我正看得出神，一滑足就落进了轧碎机。嘿，这机器劲头真大，它唏里哗啦几下子就把我们撕成碎木块了。接着，我们就进了一个很大锅里。锅里面尽是些滑溜溜的水，我们在里边洗了个澡，觉得一身都清爽了许多。从锅里出来，我们一身都变得像棉花一样又软又白了。这时候，工人们把我们往铜丝网上一送，我们变成了一张张洁白的纸粕，再也分不清你我了。
    又过了几天，车子把我们送到保定化学纤维联合厂。嗨，难怪人家说这是我国第一个现代化人造丝厂！我们刚一进厂就坐着电梯到了原液车间的顶楼上去。工人们把我们送进了有铁格板的大槽里去。我想，大概又是洗澡。果然，槽里也装的碱水。说来也奇怪，澡还没有洗完，我们都长胖了，身上也觉得像脱了层皮似的。原来是我们身上有种叫半纤维的东西，要用碱液除去。我正打算爬出铁槽，铁格板忽然动了起来，又把我们压的扁扁的了。
    “粉碎机开了没有？”我听见有人在问。
    “行，来吧！”一个人回答说。“天啊！这是要粉碎我们啦！”我还没有想清楚，就走进一对磨轮了，一会儿就变成粉末落进一个大筒。这儿没有阳光，热烘烘的。我们一进去，大铁筒就一股劲地打转，我们也不停地栽跟斗。好容易滚了出来，我急忙往前跑。一个穿白衣服的姑娘走来，把我拿到化验室去了。不多会，她告诉值班工人：“可以黄化了，分子聚合度已经适合作纺丝原料！”
    “这可把我乐坏了，要用我纺丝！我们祖祖辈辈还是第一回哩！”我想，应该赶快加紧脚步往前走。唉呀，这黄化机里可是不好受，又是二硫化碳，又是碱液，不多大工夫，我就觉得周身发粘，原来我已经和大伙混在一起成了粘胶！
    又经过几番过滤，我顺着曲曲弯弯的管道到了纺丝车上的小玻璃管里。管子前面是个小礼帽似的东西挡住了我的去路。后边的兄弟们又不断地涌上来，挤得我真要叫起来了。我还没来得及张口，就身不由己地顺着小礼帽顶上的小孔喷了出去。万没想到，就这一下，我已经变成三十股只有人头发几十分之一的细丝。刚一喷出去，我就打了个寒噤，鼻孔也觉着有些辛辣味，原来落进酸浴槽里了。还好，刚下水打个转身，工人就把我牵出来拉在一个辊筒上，我就跟着辊筒打圈。嗬，我回头一看，我们的兄弟姊妹都成光灿灿的人造丝了。我们欢呼着又去洗了几回淋浴，由黄色变成了白色。工人们又在摇丝车上把我们扎成丝绞。我看见自己遍体发光，兄弟们也遍体发光，我们真正成丝啦，我们再没有先前那股硬劲，风儿稍微一动，我们就跟着它跳舞。我听见工程师说，我们叫普通人造丝，是用来织绸缎和绒。果然，我到了丝织厂就上织机。工人们对我们特别亲热，他们叫我们是“祖国的第一批人造丝！”听说保定化学纤维联合厂第二期工程今年就要开工，建成以后，我们的另一个兄弟就要诞生了。它名叫强力丝，是专门供工业生产用的，可以做汽车轮胎帘布，等等。

    走吧，兄弟，同我一起下山去！
　  化学纤维厂的工人来欢迎我们了！
　　我们都变成了遍体发光的丝绞！
