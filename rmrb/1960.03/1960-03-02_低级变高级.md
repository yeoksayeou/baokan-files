Turning Low-Grade into High-Grade
Ma Jun
The Guangzhou and Chongqing paper mills have successfully manufactured high-grade paper using sugarcane residue. This is a new achievement in technological innovation in China's paper industry.

Sugarcane residue has always been regarded as a low-grade raw material in the paper industry, incomparable to wood, bamboo, and reeds. It was always believed that it could only be used to make ordinary paper, not high-grade paper. Moreover, the proportion of sugarcane residue pulp used could not be too high, as the quality of the paper could not be guaranteed. This was a long-standing prevailing view. Now, this traditional view has been shattered by the successful practice of Guangzhou and Chongqing paper mills using all or mostly sugarcane residue pulp to manufacture high-grade paper. From now on, sugarcane residue has transformed from a low-grade raw material into a high-grade raw material. This is a big change.

Where does this change come from? Has the sugarcane residue changed, or have people changed? The sugarcane residue has not changed; it is still composed of the same material elements as before, with nothing added or subtracted. But people have changed; people's understanding of sugarcane residue has changed, and their ability to utilize sugarcane residue has improved. Sugarcane residue inherently possesses all the conditions to be a high-grade raw material for papermaking. It's just that in the past, people's understanding of sugarcane residue was not comprehensive or profound enough. They only saw its potential as a low-grade papermaking raw material and did not see its potential as a high-grade paper raw material. Or even if they did see it, they only had the ability to use sugarcane residue as a low-grade paper raw material, and not the ability to use it as a high-grade paper raw material. Therefore, people thought that sugarcane residue was a low-grade raw material for papermaking. Through the efforts of the workers at the Guangzhou and Chongqing paper mills, they not only recognized that sugarcane residue has the conditions to be a high-grade raw material for papermaking, but also mastered the ability to use it as a high-grade raw material for papermaking. Thus, sugarcane residue has transformed from a low-grade raw material into a high-grade raw material. Therefore, it can be said that the transformation of sugarcane residue from a low-grade raw material to a high-grade raw material is the result of the continuous deepening of people's understanding of objective things, the result of the continuous improvement of people's technical level, and the result of people's subjective initiative further reacting on objective things.

Without a deep understanding of objective things, it is impossible to fully utilize them to serve us. This is true of sugarcane residue papermaking, and it is also true of the utilization of various natural resources. Many so-called low-grade raw materials, so-called useless things, and even so-called harmful things are not absolute. As people's understanding of things gradually deepens, and as science and technology continue to develop, not only will many original low-grade raw materials become high-grade raw materials, but also many "useless things" and even "harmful things" will become useful things and become high-grade raw materials. As time goes on, the material resources available to mankind will inevitably increase, and the uses of many material resources will inevitably become greater and greater. Looking at the problem from this point of view, we will be full of confidence in continuously expanding the source of industrial raw materials, and we will feel that the road is getting wider and wider.

People can understand objective things. Understanding comes from practice (including scientific experiments). The more practice, the richer the experience, the deeper the understanding of objective things. Sugarcane residue's transformation from mere firewood to a low-grade raw material for the paper industry was achieved through repeated practice by predecessors; sugarcane residue's transformation from a low-grade raw material to a high-grade raw material was also achieved through repeated practice by comrades at the Guangzhou and Chongqing paper mills. The transformation of countless resources in the world, from being useless to humans to being useful, from having only one use to having multiple uses, has also been achieved through people's continuous experimentation and continuous practice. To open up new sources of raw materials, to transform things that are currently useless or have limited uses into things that are useful or have many great uses, we need to continue to break down superstitions, continue to implement continuous technological revolutions in the use of raw materials, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and boldly and unyieldingly conduct experiments.

    低级变高级
    马骏
    广州、重庆的造纸厂用甘蔗渣制造高级纸成功了。这是我国造纸工业在技术革新方面的一个新成就。
    甘蔗渣，在造纸工业里，一向被视为低级原料，是不能跟木材、竹子、芦苇相比的。一向被认为只能造一般纸张，不能造高级纸张。而且采用甘蔗渣纸浆的比例不能太大，太大了纸张的质量就没法保证。这是长期以来支配着人们的一种看法。现在，这种传统的看法，却被广州、重庆纸厂全部或大部分使用甘蔗渣纸浆制造高级纸张成功的实践打破了。从此，甘蔗渣从低级原料一变而为高级原料。这是一个很大的变化。
    这个变化从何而来？是甘蔗渣变了，还是人变了？甘蔗渣没有变，从前是什么样的物质要素构成的，现在也还是一样，既不会多些什么，也不会少些什么。而人却变了，人对甘蔗渣的认识改变了，利用甘蔗渣的本领提高了。甘蔗渣本来就具有作造纸高级原料的一切条件。只是在以前，人们对甘蔗渣的认识不够全面，不够深刻，只看到它具有作低级造纸原料的条件，而看不到它具有作高级纸原料的条件，或者虽然看到了，也由于只有利用甘蔗渣作低级纸原料的本领，而没有利用它作高级纸原料的本领，所以人们就认为甘蔗渣是造纸的低级原料。经过广州、重庆纸厂职工的努力，不但认识了甘蔗渣有作造纸高级原料的条件，而且也掌握了利用它作造纸高级原料的本领，于是甘蔗渣就从低级原料一变而为高级原料。因此，可以说，甘蔗渣从造纸的低级原料变为高级原料，是人对客观事物的认识不断深化的结果，是人的技术水平不断提高的结果，也就是人的主观能动作用进一步反作用于客观事物的结果。
    对客观事物没有深刻的认识，就不可能充分利用它来为我们服务，甘蔗渣造纸是这样，自然界的各种资源的利用也莫不是这样。许多所谓低级原料，所谓无用之物，甚至所谓有害之物，都不是绝对的。随着人们对事物的认识逐步深化，随着科学技术的不断发展，不仅许多原来的低级原料会变成高级原料，而且许多“无用之物”、甚至“有害之物”，也将变为有用之物，变为高级原料。随着时间的推移，可供人类利用的物质资源必然越来越多，许多物质资源的用途也必然越来越大。用这个观点看问题，我们对不断扩大工业原料材料的来源，就会充满着信心，就会觉得路越走越宽。
    人是可以认识客观事物的。认识来源于实践（包括科学试验），实践越多，经验越丰富，认识客观事物就越能够深化。甘蔗渣从仅仅作为燃火的柴草变为造纸工业的低级原料，是经过前人的反复实践才成功的；甘蔗渣从造纸的低级原料变为高级原料，也是经过广州、重庆纸厂的同志反复实践才成功的。世界上许许多多的资源，从对人类没有用处到有用处，从只有一种用途到有多种用途，也都是经过人们的不断尝试、不断实践才成功的。我们要开辟新的原料材料来源，要把现在对我们还没有用或者用途还不大的东西，变成对我们有用或者用途很多很大的东西，这就需要我们继续破除迷信，继续在原料材料的使用方面实行不断的技术革命，敢想敢说敢干，大胆地百折不挠地进行试验。
