Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 9th. Burmese newspapers continued to publish editorials or commentaries on the 9th, praising the rice transplanters given to Prime Minister Ne Win by the Chinese government. "Burma New Era" said that the Burmese rice production method is very laborious. If Chinese rice transplanters can be used on a large scale, this would mean a major revolution in Burmese rice farming.

　　"Industry Truth" published a commentary saying that a wooden Chinese rice transplanter only costs 15 kyats, but it can do the work of five people. Although the price of iron rice transplanters is more expensive, they can do the work of 25 to 30 people a day. Places like Upper Burma are suitable for using this kind of machine.

　　The newspaper pointed out that if the Burmese Union government could arrange for Burmese farmers to use this machine, it would not only save a lot of labor, but also save a lot of time.

　　"Burma Times" pointed out that if the Burmese government could produce this machine and sell or distribute it to farmers cheaply, it could increase the rice cultivation area without increasing the labor force.

    缅甸报纸赞扬我国插秧机
    新华社仰光9日电　缅甸各报9日继续发表社论或评论，赞扬中国政府赠送给奈温总理的水稻插秧机。“缅甸新时代报”说，缅甸的水稻生产方法是非常累人的。如果可以大规模采用中国插秧机，这将意味着缅甸稻米耕种的一次大革命。
      “产业真理报”发表评论说，一台木料做的中国插秧机只需要十五缅元，但是，它能抵五个人的工作。铁制插秧机的价格虽然比较贵一些，但是，一天可以抵二十五人到三十人的工作。像上缅甸等地方适合于使用这种机器。
    这家报纸指出，如果缅甸联邦政府能够安排缅甸农民使用这种机器，那么，不仅能节约很多劳动，并且还节约不少时间。
    “缅甸时报”指出，如果缅甸政府能生产这种机器，并且廉价出售或分配给农民，那么，可以在不增加劳动力的情况下，增加稻米耕种面积。
