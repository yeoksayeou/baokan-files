    Experts Outside the Factory
    He Qing
    After the People's Daily published letters on the second page on February 8th in the "Caring About Our Common Cause" column, widely soliciting opinions on improving the "Liberation" brand automobile from the First Automobile Works, in the short period of less than a month, the First Automobile Works received more than 160 letters from all over the country. Many of the opinions raised in these letters belong to urgent problems in automobile manufacturing around the world that need to be solved but have not been solved, and many are new methods that cannot be found in books. These enthusiastic letters not only show the broad masses' concern, care, and expectations for our domestically produced automobiles, but more importantly, they once again prove the endless wisdom of the masses; attaching importance to mobilizing the strength of the masses can make the work better and better.
    The "Liberation" brand automobile produced in our country has been considered a car of good quality both domestically and abroad for several years since its introduction. This is because we referred to relevant domestic and foreign materials when designing it, humbly learned from other people's experience, and combined it with the characteristics of Chinese raw materials and usage requirements. However, everything is constantly developing upwards, "good" can be even better, "refined" can be even more refined, and there is no limit to achieving perfection in a product. The best appraisers of whether a product is good or not so good, and where there are shortcomings, should be the users, not the direct producers. Whether the place where the car's tool box is placed is appropriate or not, whether it is convenient to use, and whether the ventilation in the cab is good, the drivers feel it the most deeply; in addition to the driver, the auto repair workers are the most familiar with the performance characteristics of various components of the car, even a screw. Transportation workers who handle loading and unloading, although not as closely connected to the car itself as drivers and repair workers, can also gain some understanding from their local contact. These people do not seem to be professional experts in automobile design and manufacturing. However, they are all concrete examiners of automobile performance. Only by constantly soliciting their opinions can we continuously improve product quality and make products more perfect day by day.
    Chairman Mao told us in "On Practice" that theory comes from practice and then guides practice, circulating repeatedly, to infinity. This is the inevitable path for the development of all things. Product production is the same. It can only be continuously improved through users from practice; then practice again, then improve again, constantly circulating repeatedly, so that the product can continuously "climb to a higher level" and better meet the needs of the people.
    The First Automobile Works did the right thing. They not only widely solicited the opinions of users, but also consolidated it as a system; they will also hire some "experts outside the factory" as their special designers, often contact them, and participate in their design work. In society, there are many "experts outside the factory" who do not belong to their own positions. All walks of life should pay attention to this group of "experts outside the factory" because they are an inexhaustible source of wisdom.

    厂外行家

    人民日报在2月8日二版“关心我们共同的事业”的来信专栏中刊登了第一汽车制造厂广泛征求改进“解放牌”汽车的信以后，在不到一个月的短短的时间里，第一汽车制造厂接到了来自全国各地一百六十多封信，这些信提出的意见，很多是属于世界上汽车制造方面迫切需要解决而没有解决的问题，很多是书本上找不到的新办法。这些热情洋溢的信，不仅表明了广大群众对于我们国产汽车的关心、爱护和期望，更重要的是它再一次证明群众智慧的无穷无尽；重视动员群众力量，就能够把工作愈做愈好。
    我国出产的“解放牌”汽车问世几年来，在国内国外，都被认为是质量较好的汽车。这是由于我们在设计它时，就参考了国内外有关资料，虚心地学习了人家的经验，并结合了中国的原材料特点和使用要求而取得的结果。但是，什么事情都是不断向上发展的，“好”上还能再好，“精”上还有更精，一件产品要达到完美是永无极限的。一件产品是好，还是不太好，什么地方有缺陷，最好的鉴定者应该说不是直接生产者，而是使用者。汽车的工具箱放的地方合适不合适，用起来顺手不顺手，驾驶室通风好不好，司机的感受最深；汽车上面的各种机件、甚至一个螺丝的性能脾气，除了司机以外，汽车修理工人是最熟悉的。交通运输方面的搬运、装卸工人，虽然跟汽车本身不像司机、修理工人那样密切，但也可以从他们的局部接触有所体会。这些人看来都不是研究汽车设计和汽车制造的专业行家。但是，他们却都是汽车效能的具体考查者。只有经常地不断地征询他们的意见，才能不断改进产品质量，使产品日趋完善。
    毛主席在“实践论”里面曾告诉我们，理论来源于实践，再来指导实践，循环往复，以至无穷。这是一切事物发展的必经之路。产品生产也是一样，只有不断通过使用者从实践来提高；再实践，再提高，不断地循环往复，才能使产品不断“更上一层楼”，更好地满足人民的需要。
    第一汽车制造厂做对了。他们不但广泛地征求了使用者的意见，而且把它作为制度巩固了下来；他们还将聘请一些“厂外行家”作为他们的特约设计员，经常和他们联系，参加他们的设计工作。在社会上，像这样的属于非本身职务的“厂外行家”是很多的，各行各业，都应该重视这批“厂外行家”，因为他们是取之不尽，用之不竭的智慧的源泉。
