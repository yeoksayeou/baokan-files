    Serving as Pioneers of the Technical Revolution
    Hua Ren
    The technical innovation movement recently sweeping across our country's factories, rural areas, and streets is broad in scope and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, bearing a great resemblance to the nationwide mass steelmaking campaign of 1958. The vast numbers of teachers and students, educated and tempered by the revolution, have rushed to factories and gone deep into the countryside, working alongside the workers and peasants. Combining teaching and scientific research, they offer ideas and find solutions, opening the doors to technical innovation and technical revolution. The news from Zhejiang University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Taiyuan Institute of Technology published in today's newspaper are excellent examples.
    The significance of this event lies not only in the event itself, but more importantly, it reflects the profound changes that have taken place in higher education since the education revolution in our country. The vast numbers of teachers and students can participate in the current practical struggles as masters of their own destiny, contributing their wisdom. Once they come into contact with reality, they quickly see results. The teachers and students of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Zhejiang University, in cooperation with workers, have completed more than 800 technical innovation projects since going to the factory in January, more than 100 of which are major technical innovation projects. The teachers and students of the Foundry Department of Harbin Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Harbin Jinxing Machinery Factory, enabled this small factory, which was merged from a handicraft cooperative and a district street factory, to quickly realize the full mechanization and partial automation of foundry production. The teachers and students of Taiyuan Institute of Technology have also achieved great results.
    The reason why these three schools have been able to achieve such great results in a short period of time is mainly because the vast numbers of teachers and students understand the unparalleled superiority of the Party's education policy. This road is not getting narrower and narrower, but wider and wider, and more and more bright. The Electrical Automation Specialty of the Harbin Institute of Technology, because of its cooperation with factories, began research on electrical automation several years earlier than originally planned. The teachers and students of Taiyuan Institute of Technology in Shanxi, who went to the factory, became one with the workers and became the closest friends in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Without the Party's education policy, where would today's excellent situation be? The vast numbers of teachers and students have begun to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects, becoming laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.
    However, the separation of education from politics and production is an old tradition of thousands of years. Its roots are very deep. Bourgeois pedagogy is a pedagogy of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive." We must thoroughly oppose this kind of thinking, and we must go through a long period of struggle. The most important thing is to firmly implement the Party's education policy under the leadership of the Party, without wavering and without being satisfied. The economic construction of our country is developing more and more deeply. With the continuous deepening of the political and ideological revolution, the education revolution must also become more and more profound. Zhejiang University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Taiyuan Institute of Technology, according to the development of production, actively participate in the torrent of technical innovation and technical revolution, fully embodying this spirit of continuous revolution. This is an experience worthy of our full attention.

    充当技术革命的尖兵
    华仁
    最近在我国工厂、农村和街道掀起的技术革新运动，其范围之广，深入人心之深，大有1958年全民大炼钢铁之势。受了革命教育锻炼的广大师生，奔赴工厂，深入农村，和工农群众一块，结合教学和科学研究，出主意想办法，敲开技术革新和技术革命的大门。今天本报发表的浙江大学、哈尔滨工业大学和太原工学院的新闻，就是很好的例子。
    这件事的重要意义，不仅在于事情的本身，更重要的是反映我国教育革命以来高等学校所起的深刻变化。广大师生都能以主人的身份参加当前的实际斗争，贡献出他们的智慧来。他们一经和实际接触，很快就见成效。浙江大学电机系的师生，在和工人的合作下，从1月份下厂以来，已完成了八百多项技术革新项目，其中重大技术革新项目就有一百多项。哈尔滨工业大学铸工专业师生，和哈尔滨金星机械厂协作，使这个由手工业合作社和区街工厂合并而成的小工厂，很快实现铸工生产全盘机械化和部分自动化。太原工学院的师生，也同样取得了巨大成就。
    这三个学校，所以能在短时期内取得这样大的成绩，主要是因为广大师生理解了党的教育方针的无比的优越性。这条路不是越走越窄，而是越走越宽，越走越是光明灿烂。哈尔滨工业大学工业企业电气化专业因为同工厂协作，就比原来提前几年开始了电气自动化的研究，山西太原工学院下厂师生，和工人打成一片，成了技术革新和技术革命运动中最亲密的朋友。没有党的教育方针，哪有今天的大好形势呢？广大师生开始在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    但是，教育脱离政治、脱离生产，是几千年的旧传统。它的根是很深的，资产阶级的教育学就是少慢差费的教育学，我们要彻底反掉这种思想，还要经过长期的斗争。最主要的就是在党的领导下，坚定不移地贯彻党的教育方针，毫不动摇，毫不满足。我们国家的经济建设越来越发展，越来越深入，随着政治、思想革命的不断深入，教育革命也必须越来越深入。浙江大学、哈尔滨工业大学和太原工学院，根据生产的发展，积极投入技术革新和技术革命的洪流，充分体现了这种不断革命的精神。这是值得我们充分重视的经验。
