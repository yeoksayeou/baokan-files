Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd: Members of the Guanqiao People's Commune in Anxi County, Fujian Province, have successfully created 66 types of rapid seedling cultivation methods for fruit trees, timber trees, medicinal herbs, flowers, and grasses using techniques such as short-shoot cuttings and rootstock grafting, making significant contributions to the high-speed development of fruit, timber, and medicinal herb production. This innovation has received unanimous attention from the Fujian Provincial Party and government leadership and scientific research departments. Under the call of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee, all communes in the province are widely learning and promoting the advanced experience of Guanqiao Commune in high-speed seedling cultivation.

In the past, the Guanqiao Commune area mostly used sowing methods to cultivate fruit trees and timber trees, which generally took two to three years to cultivate seedlings. After the establishment of the People's Commune, a nursery with an area of more than 1,000 mu was established. The broad masses of commune members overcame various difficulties and conducted asexual reproduction experiments, mainly with cuttings, on eighty-two varieties of fruit, timber, medicinal herb, and flower seedlings, with sixty-six varieties successfully cultivated. Among them, more than fifty varieties were cultivated by cutting propagation, and seven varieties by rootstock grafting. Peach seedlings, which were previously considered difficult to propagate by cutting in the local area, achieved a survival rate of 80%; the survival rate of short-shoot cuttings of oil-tea camellia reached more than 98%; and the survival rate of teak, a valuable timber that previously relied on imported seed propagation, reached 100%. The success of this asexual reproduction rapid seedling cultivation experiment solved the difficulty of insufficient seedlings in the high-speed development of fruit, timber, woody oil, and economic crop production.

    福建官桥公社创造林木快速育苗法
    据新华社福州22日电　福建省安溪县官桥人民公社社员，用短穗扦插、根茎嫁接等方法，创造成功了六十六种果树、林木、药材、花草等快速育苗法，为高速度发展水果、林木、药材等生产作出了重大贡献。这一创造，受到福建省党政领导机关和科学研究部门的一致重视。在中共福建省委的号召下，全省各公社正普遍学习和推广官桥公社高速度育苗的先进经验。
    官桥公社所在地区，过去营造果树、林木，大多是用播种的方法，一般需要两、三年的时间才能培育成苗。人民公社成立后，建立了有一千多亩面积的苗圃，广大社员克服了各种困难，进行以扦插为主的八十二个品种的果、木、药、花苗的无性繁殖试验，有六十六种得到成功。其中扦插育苗的有五十多种，根茎嫁接的有七种。在当地一向被认为很难用扦插繁殖的桃苗，成活率也达到80％；油茶短穗扦插的成活率达到98％以上，过去依靠国外输入种子繁殖的名贵用材——柚木的成活率达到百分之百。这种无性繁殖快速育苗试验的成功，解决了高速度发展水果、林木、木本油料和经济作物等生产中苗木不足的困难。
