Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd. Pi Shushi, Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and Archbishop of the Shenyang Archdiocese, issued a statement today, saying that the shameless statement by U.S. Secretary of State Herter defending American spy Walsh exposed the heinous face of U.S. imperialism's resolute hostility towards new China.

In his statement, Pi Shushi expressed his complete support for the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's verdict on American spy Walsh and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique. He said that it was precisely because of the Chinese judicial organs' verdict, which severely struck at the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to subvert our people's democratic regime, that the U.S. government became infuriated. Secretary of State Herter then hurriedly came forward himself and issued a so-called "statement." However, his "statement" dared not touch on any facts, which truly showed a guilty conscience.

    中国天主教友爱国会主席皮漱石发表谈话
    痛斥赫脱为华理柱辩护
    据新华社22日讯　中国天主教友爱国会主席、沈阳总教区总主教皮漱石今天发表谈话说：美国国务卿赫脱为美国间谍分子华理柱进行辩护的无耻声明，暴露了美帝国主义坚决敌视新中国的凶恶面目。
    皮漱石在谈话中，表示完全拥护上海市中级人民法院对美国间谍分子华理柱和龚品梅反革命叛国集团的判决。他说，正由于中国司法机关的判决，沉重地打击了美帝国主义颠覆我国人民民主政权的阴谋，美国政府恼羞成怒，国务卿赫脱便急忙亲自出马，发出了所谓“声明”。但是，他的“声明”不敢触及任何事实，这真是作贼心虚。
