Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 15th: The Shenyang Shirt Factory organized its workers to master and utilize the newly emerged mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment in the technical innovation movement, increasing the factory's daily shirt output from 1,200 pieces in the past to 2,000 pieces.

The Shenyang Shirt Factory's mechanization and semi-mechanization level was originally only 20.6%. In the entire production process, except for sewing using foot-pedal machines, all other processes were manual operations. During the great technical revolution movement, the factory's employees created and modified more than sixty types and one hundred and sixty pieces of mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment and tools, such as sizing machines, double-needle sewing machines, collar pressing machines, and button sewing machines, increasing labor productivity by one to several times respectively. However, when these new equipments first appeared, they were not completely mastered and used by the workers. To this end, the factory's leadership conducted investigations and studies and found that the main reasons for this phenomenon were: workers jumping from manual operation to mechanical operation all at once were not skilled in the technology and could not master it; or they were unwilling to use it because they felt it was not easy to use; some middle-level leaders saw that the efficiency of workers using machines was not high, feared affecting production, and were not actively supportive.

In response to the above situation, the factory's Party branch promptly convened a meeting of middle-level leaders, so that each cadre realized that the emergence of new equipment must go through a period of time to be mastered by workers, and the leaders must vigorously support it. At the same time, technical performance competitions were carried out among the workers to educate the workers about the superiority of the new equipment with practical examples. In the performance competition, worker Min Shuxia used a double-needle sewing machine to process 400 shirts a day, which was one-third more than the factory's most skilled sewing worker, leaving a deep impression on the workers. In order to enable workers to rapidly improve their technical level and be able to skillfully use various new equipment, the factory also organized personnel from the tool workshop to hold technical lectures, explaining mechanical principles to workers in each shirt production workshop, teaching workers operating methods, and organizing workers to learn from each other through practical demonstrations and machine-side guidance. After these measures, the workers' enthusiasm for mastering innovative equipment generally increased, thereby rapidly improving the production level.

### 教育干部支持新事物　帮助工人掌握新技术  沈阳市衬衣厂革新创造的设备大显威风

    教育干部支持新事物　帮助工人掌握新技术
    沈阳市衬衣厂革新创造的设备大显威风
    新华社沈阳15日电　沈阳市衬衣厂组织职工掌握、运用在技术革新运动中新出现的机械化、半机械化设备，使全厂衬衣日产量由过去的一千二百件增长到二千件。
    沈阳衬衣厂原来机械化、半机械化程度只有20．6％。在整个生产过程中，除缝纫使用脚蹬机器以外，其它工序都是手工操作。在大闹技术革命运动中，全厂职工创造和改制浆布机、双针缝纫机、压领机、钉扣机等机械化、半机械化设备和工具六十多种、一百六十件，分别提高劳动生产率一倍到数倍。但是，这些新设备刚一出现的时候，并没有完全被工人群众掌握和运用。为此，这个厂的领导方面进行了调查研究，发现产生这种现象的主要原因是：工人从手工操作一下子跳到用机械操作，技术不熟练，掌握不了；或是因为感到不顺手不愿使用；一些中层领导干部看到工人使用机器效率不高，害怕影响产量，也不积极支持。
    针对上述情况，工厂党支部及时召开了中层领导干部会议，使每个干部认识到新设备的出现，必然要经过一段时间才能为工人所掌握，领导干部必须大力支持。同时，在工人中开展了技术表演赛，以实际事例教育工人认识到新设备的优越性。工人闵淑霞在表演赛中使用双针缝纫机，一天加工出四百件衬衣，比厂内缝纫技术最高明的工人还多三分之一，给工人留下了深刻的印象。为了使工人迅速提高技术水平，能熟练地使用各项新设备，这个厂还组织工具车间人员举办技术讲座，向生产衬衣各车间工人讲解机械原理，教给工人操作方法，并且通过实际表演、机旁指导等形式，组织工人展开互学。经过这些措施后，工人们对掌握革新设备的积极性普遍高涨，从而迅速地提高了生产水平。
