Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, March 12th. Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, and Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, visited the temporary reception center for returned overseas Chinese in Jimei, Xiamen, yesterday afternoon to express their regards to the returned overseas Chinese.

Lin Yixin and others visited every room where the overseas Chinese were staying to inquire about their living and eating arrangements since returning to the country. Xu Xiong, an elderly man who had lived in Indonesia for forty-six years, had four sons who all died of illness in Indonesia. This time, he and his wife, Huang Qiuniang, returned to China on a ship sent by the motherland and received warm reception from their compatriots. When Lin Yixin and others visited his room to express their regards, he said with emotion, "The motherland is the backing of overseas Chinese!" His wife, Huang Qiuniang, wearing the new clothes given to her by the motherland, also said with a smile, "I am so happy to be back in the motherland." He Youxu's family of twelve all returned to the motherland. He said to Lin Yixin, "Thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership, otherwise my family of twelve would not have been able to return. I will definitely ask my family to do their best to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland." In the dormitory for returned overseas Chinese students, Lin Yixin cordially asked each returned overseas Chinese student whether they were accustomed to the life and reminded them to pay attention to the changes in the domestic climate, take care of their health, study hard, and learn skills so that they could better serve the socialist motherland in the future.

Accompanying Lin Yixin and Chen Shaokuan on their visit were Wang Hanjie, Director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Li Wenling, Mayor of Xiamen, Gao Jianfeng, Deputy Commissioner of Jinjiang Prefecture, Lin Zhuguang, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and Chen Di, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of Longxi Prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, March 12th. More than 1,800 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who recently arrived in Fujian Province have been properly settled. Among them, more than 1,100 people have been settled in the Yunxiao Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm and the Yongchun Beikong Overseas Chinese Tea and Fruit Farm to participate in production. They set off from Xiamen and Zhangzhou today respectively. A group of returned overseas Chinese have been assigned to work in industrial and mining enterprises and will also be able to depart soon. More than 500 returned overseas Chinese students have already begun their studies and lives.

The overseas Chinese happily accepted the arrangements made by the motherland and expressed their determination to repay the motherland's care for them with practical actions to improve production and study. Overseas Chinese Mai Hanbing wrote in his letter of determination: "The motherland is my home everywhere. Wherever the motherland needs me, I will go." Yang Miaosheng, a returned overseas Chinese assigned to the Yunxiao Changshan Farm, said that he would guarantee to learn skills from the veteran farm members after arriving at the farm and contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 13th. More than 1,300 overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia have recently arrived at the Wuming Overseas Chinese Farm in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to settle down.

Along the 70-kilometer road from Nanning, the capital of the autonomous region, to the residential area of the returned overseas Chinese at the farm, slogans and banners warmly welcoming the overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in socialist construction were posted everywhere. Residents, commune members, and farm workers along the way set up tea stations and rest stations by the roadside to warmly welcome the returning relatives. Li Renren, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and his wife visited and expressed their regards to the returned overseas Chinese at the farm yesterday.

Before the arrival of the returned overseas Chinese, the leading cadres and veteran workers of the Wuming Overseas Chinese Farm had already prepared houses and furniture for their relatives who had gone through hardships in Indonesia. After the returned overseas Chinese got off the bus, they quickly moved into their new homes.

    祖国处处热情关怀归国侨胞
    中共福建省委书记林一心等前往厦门慰问归侨
    两批归国华侨分赴新的工作学习场所
    新华社厦门12日电　中共福建省委书记处书记、福建省接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任林一心和福建省副省长陈绍宽，昨天下午到厦门集美归国华侨临时招待所，向归侨们进行了慰问。
    林一心等到侨胞们住的每一个房间，了解侨胞回国后的起居饮食情况。在印度尼西亚侨居四十六年的老人许雄图，四个儿子都在印度尼西亚病死了。这次他和妻子黄求娘乘祖国派去的轮船回国，受到祖国亲人的殷勤接待。当林一心等到他住的房间慰问他时，他激动地说：“祖国是华侨的靠山啊！”他的老伴黄求娘穿着祖国发给她的新衣服，也笑迷迷地说：“回到祖国真高兴”。归侨何攸续一家十二口人全部回到祖国，他向林一心说：“多亏毛主席英明领导，不然我全家十二口人是回不来的。我一定叫我家人尽力参加祖国社会主义建设。”在归国华侨学生宿舍，林一心见到每一个归侨学生时，都亲切地问他们生活习惯不习惯，并叮嘱他们要注意国内气候的变化，保护好身体，好好读书，学好本领，以便将来更好地为社会主义祖国工作。
    同林一心、陈绍宽一起前往慰问的，还有福建省华侨事务委员会主任王汉杰，厦门市市长李文陵，晋江专区副专员高剑峰，福建省归国华侨联合会副主席林珠光和龙溪专区华侨事务局局长陈迪。
    据新华社厦门12日电　最近从广州到福建省的一千八百多名印度尼西亚归侨，已经得到妥善安置。其中一千一百多人安置到云霄常山华侨农场、永春北硿华侨茶果场参加生产，他们今天分别从厦门、漳州出发。有一批归侨安置在工矿企业工作，不日也可动身。五百多名归国华侨学生已经开始学习生活。
    侨胞们愉快地接受了祖国的分配，并纷纷表示要以搞好生产和学习的实际行动，来报答祖国对他们的关怀。侨胞麦寒冰在决心书上写道：“祖国到处是我家，祖国需要我到那里去，我就到那里去。”分配到云霄常山农场的归侨杨淼生表示，保证到农场以后好好向老场员学习本领，为祖国社会主义建设贡献力量。
    据新华社南宁13日电　一千三百多名从印度尼西亚回国的华侨，最近到达广西僮族自治区武鸣华侨农场安家落户。
    从自治区首府南宁到农场的归侨住地，七十多公里长的公路两旁，到处张贴着热烈欢迎侨胞回国参加社会主义建设的标语和横额。沿途居民、公社社员和农场职工们在路边设了茶水站、休息站，热情欢迎回国的亲人。中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任、广西僮族自治区副主席李任仁和他的夫人，昨天到农场看望和慰问归侨。
    归侨们到达之前，武鸣华侨农场领导干部和老职工们就已经给在印度尼西亚历尽艰辛的亲人们准备好了房子和家具。归侨们下车后，很快就搬进新居。
