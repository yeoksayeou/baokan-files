Defending the Fruits of the Revolution
——After Watching the Cuban Film “This Land of Ours”
Cong Shan

It was very exciting to see the first Cuban film "This Land of Ours" being screened in our country. We, the liberated Chinese people, are always concerned about the lives and struggles of the Cuban people. We sympathize with their past suffering; we celebrated with them the overthrow of Batista's dictatorial rule; we are pleased with every step forward the Cuban people have made in realizing the slogan of "land to the tiller"; we share the hatred of the Cuban people and resolutely support their struggle against interference by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people, who are so concerned with the worries and joys of the Cuban people, how can they suppress their inner excitement once they see the land and people of Cuba on the screen?

This documentary film "This Land of Ours," produced by the National Cultural Department of the Cuban Rebel Army, although brief, reflects quite simply the struggle of the Cuban people for land. It vividly shows us the past of enslavement and plunder suffered by the Cuban people and the fruits of revolutionary victory they won with their blood. In this uniquely endowed country, known as "Paradise," before the revolution, the vast majority of the people were sufferers in "Paradise." Cuba has favorable weather and extremely fertile land, and sugarcane, on which the people depend for their livelihood, is a "national treasure" that can yield abundant harvests for decades after a single planting. However, as the film tells us, in the dark days before the revolution, when dictators were in power and large plantation owners ran rampant, there was widespread unemployment and famine. In this "sweetest" country, the people lived the bitterest lives. After watching the scenes in the film of farmers being driven out of their huts, land being seized by large plantation owners, and women and children being massacred by Batista's troops, we naturally think of the suffering of farmers in old China and the brutal crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. But in no time at all, Cuba's little Chiang Kai-shek was overthrown, and six million people began to taste the flavor of the "sweetest country."

Seeing several scenes in the film depicting how the armed people fought bravely against the counter-revolutionary armed forces and finally eliminated the dictatorial regime, we admire the heroic struggle of the Cuban people. At the same time, we feel that the path taken by the Cuban people of "using armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution" is very correct. As the film's commentary introduces, the decisive factor for the Cuban people's current situation is the seven-year armed struggle against the Batista dictatorship. Without such a heroic and unyielding bloody struggle, it would be unimaginable to make the Batista elements, armed to the teeth and supported by U.S. imperialism, return the land to the Cuban people and let the Cuban people truly become the masters of "Paradise." The short sentence in the film, "Today's soldiers have become the protectors of the people," vividly illustrates the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Cuban people's children in military uniform and the people. Today, with the support of all the people of Latin America and the peace-loving people of the world, as long as the Cuban people are closely united, holding higher and higher this bright banner of national democratic revolution, and carrying out the struggle, then any conspiracy by U.S. imperialism to enslave the Cuban people will never succeed!

The film uses a series of convincing figures and facts to illustrate how Cuban farmers gained land through land reform after the revolution. The struggle of the Cuban people shows that to achieve a truly great victory in the national democratic revolution, it is necessary to overthrow the rule of the big plantation owners. Without uprooting this social pillar of reactionary dictatorial rule and the enslavement by U.S. imperialism, the already victorious fruits of the revolution will not be consolidated.

The Cuban film is being screened at the same time that Eisenhower is wearing a "goodwill" mask to "visit" four South American countries to plot further interference in Cuba. "The night cat enters the house, it brings no good," and the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism has aroused a high degree of vigilance among the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries.

After watching this Cuban film, we are even more convinced that the Cuban people will never again be slaves in "Paradise." The heroic Cuban people will surely be able to smash all the conspiracies of imperialism, resolutely implement land reform, and defend the victorious fruits of the Cuban national democratic revolution.

    保卫革命果实
    ——古巴影片“我们的这块土地”观后
    丛山
    看到在我国上映的第一部古巴影片“我们的这块土地”，感到非常的兴奋。我们解放了的中国人民时时刻刻都在关心着古巴人民的生活和斗争。我们同情他们过去的苦难历程；我们同他们一起欢庆过他们推翻巴蒂斯塔的独裁统治；我们为古巴人民在实现“耕者有其田”的口号下所取得的每一步进展而感到高兴；我们和古巴人民同仇敌忾，坚决支持他们反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争。就是这样地为古巴人民之忧而忧、为古巴人民之乐而乐的中国人民，一旦在银幕上目睹了古巴的土地和人民，怎能抑制住自己内心的兴奋呢？
    古巴起义军全国文化部拍摄的这部纪录片“我们的这块土地”，虽然简短，然而相当朴实地反映了古巴人民为争取土地而斗争的面貌。它以生动的画面向我们展示了古巴人民遭受奴役和掠夺的过去以及他们用鲜血换来的革命的胜利果实。在得天独厚、被称为“乐园”的这个国家里，在这次革命前，广大人民却是“乐园”里的受难者。古巴风调雨顺，土地异常肥沃，而人民赖以为生的甘蔗，又是一次下种就可以一连几十年丰收的“国宝”。但是，正如影片告诉我们的，在革命前独裁者当道、大庄园主横行的黑暗日子里，到处是一片失业和饥饿的惨象。在这个“最甜”的国家，人民却过着最苦的日子。看了影片里农民被赶出茅舍、土地被大庄园主圈占、妇孺被巴蒂斯塔军队残杀的那些镜头，使我们自然地联想到旧中国农民的痛苦遭遇和蒋介石反动派的残暴罪行。但是，曾几何时，古巴的小蒋介石被打倒了，六百万人民开始尝到“最甜的国家”的滋味了。
    看了影片中描绘武装的人民如何同反革命武装奋战并最后消灭独裁政权的几个镜头，使我们在敬佩古巴人民英勇斗争的同时，感到古巴人民所走的“以武装的革命反对武装的反革命”的道路，是十分正确的。正如影片解说词所介绍的，古巴人民之所以有今天，起决定作用的就是七年的反巴蒂斯塔独裁的武装斗争。没有那样英勇不屈的流血斗争，要使武装到牙齿并受美帝国主义支持的巴蒂斯塔分子把土地交还给古巴人民，让古巴人民真正成为“乐园”的主人，是不可想像的。影片中短短的一句“如今的士兵成了人民的保护者”，生动地说明了穿着军装的古巴人民子弟同人民的血肉关系。今天，在全体拉丁美洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，只要古巴人民紧密团结，越来越高地举起这面鲜明的民族民主革命旗帜，进行斗争，那末美帝国主义想奴役古巴人民的任何阴谋都决不能得逞！ 
    影片以一串令人信服的数字与事实，说明古巴农民如何经过革命后的土地改革获得了土地。古巴人民的斗争说明，要使民族民主革命获得真正伟大的胜利，不打垮大庄园主的统治是不行的。不拔掉这一个反动独裁政权和美帝国主义奴役的社会支柱，已经胜利了的革命果实也是不会巩固的。
    在古巴影片上映的这几天，正赶上艾森豪威尔披着“亲善”的画皮去南美四个国家“访问”策划进一步干涉古巴。“夜猫子进宅，无事不来”，美帝国主义的阴谋已经引起了古巴人民和拉丁美洲各国人民高度的警惕。
    看了古巴的这部影片以后，我们更加相信：古巴人民决不会再作“乐园”里的奴隶了。英勇的古巴人民，一定能够粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋，坚决推行土地改革，是保卫古巴民族民主革命胜利果实。
