A Common Worker

    She was the first to win the Red Flag of the Seven-Year Plan
    Textile worker Vichinova has advanced thinking and listens to the Party
    Achieved the production level of the Seven-Year Plan in one year
    Vichinova, a female worker at the "Unity" textile factory in Ivanovo Oblast, Soviet Union, reached the production level stipulated for the last year of the Seven-Year Plan in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. She was the first person to win the Red Flag of the Seven-Year Plan in industrial production, and a role model for everyone to learn from on the Soviet industrial front.
    Vichinova is an ordinary weaver. Her experience is simple: graduated from middle school, entered a factory school, and then became a weaver. Her father was also an old textile worker who worked in textile factories for a long time. Vichinova loves the textile industry. She is very familiar with the weaving machines she oversees and can constantly improve equipment utilization. She understands what the Party teaches: as long as you are good at using the machines you operate and adopt advanced labor methods, any machine can produce high-quality, low-cost products.
    A person with advanced thinking and a spirit of innovation can change the situation wherever they work. Vichinova is such a person. When she reached the Seven-Year Plan production level last August, it was precisely in the factory's backward work team, using the factory's oldest "old-fashioned" machines. Not long after she transferred from an advanced work team to a long-term backward work team, she completely changed the face of this work team.
    Vichinova achieved the goal of improving production through technological innovation. Her method was to modernize existing machinery and equipment to tap potential. After modernization, the speed of the looms increased from 240 revolutions per minute to 270 revolutions per minute. This means that each work team can weave an additional 7 to 10 meters of cloth on each loom.
    Vichinova's second method is to correctly and perfectly organize her labor methods. She cares very much about the machines, often oils them, and constantly pays attention to the quality of the shuttle and other parts. In the past, this was generally considered the responsibility of the deputy foreman, but now Vichinova takes on this responsibility herself. After taking over the shift, she first oils the machine, then cleans up all the flying fluff, inspects the parts, and starts the machine after everything is ready. She pays close attention to analyzing the causes of various thread breaks and tries to solve the problem.
    Vichinova said well at a meeting of advanced textile workers in Ivanovo Oblast: "The work of a weaver is ordinary, but it is very important to correctly organize one's work and constantly improve labor methods."
    She also said: "I always constantly pay attention to everything new in the work of textile workers." Indeed, for many years, she has always been learning anytime, anywhere: learning from others in the factory during the day, and burying herself in books at home at night, studying advanced things in the entire textile industry.
    Last August, the looms she managed wove more than 14,300 weft threads per hour, far surpassing the level stipulated by the Seven-Year Plan. In September, it reached more than 14,600, and in November, it reached more than 14,700. After that, it continued to rise every month. She completed the annual production plan last October and produced an additional 18,000 meters of cloth beyond the plan by the end of the year.
    Vichinova has opened up a path for the textile industry to quickly complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The factory where she works is vigorously carrying out the modernization of machinery and equipment.
    Now, not only Ivanovo Oblast, but also textile factories across the country are learning from Vichinova's initiative. Many factories have reached the level of equipment utilization rate stipulated by the Seven-Year Plan.

### 她首先夺得七年计划的红旗  纺织女工维契诺娃思想先进听党的话  在一年中达到了七年计划的生产水平

    她首先夺得七年计划的红旗
    纺织女工维契诺娃思想先进听党的话
    在一年中达到了七年计划的生产水平
    苏联伊万诺夫州“团结”纺织工厂的女工维契诺娃，还在七年计划的第一年就达到了七年计划规定的最后一年的生产水平。她是在工业生产方面首先夺下了七年计划红旗的第一个人，是苏联工业战线上大家学习的一个榜样。
    维契诺娃是一名普通的织布女工。她的经历很简单：中学毕业，进入工厂学校，然后就担任织布工作。她的父亲也是老纺织工人，长期在纺织工厂中工作。维契诺娃热爱纺织事业，对她所看管的织布机器非常熟悉，能够经常不断地提高设备利用率。她懂得党所教导的话：只要善于应用自己所操作的机器，采用先进的劳动方法，任何机器都能够生产出质量高成本低的产品。
    一个有先进思想和革新精神的人不管在那里工作，就能改变那里的情况。维契诺娃就是这样的人物。她在去年8月达到七年计划生产水平的时候，恰恰就是在工厂里落后的工作班里，使用的机器也是工厂里最陈旧的“老爷”机器。她从先进工作班转移到长期落后的工作班不久，就把这里工作班的面貌完全改变了。
    维契诺娃是靠技术革新达到改进生产的目标的。她采取的方法，是使现有的机器设备现代化，这样来发掘潜力。经过现代化以后，织布机的转速从每分钟二百四十转提高到二百七十转。这就是说，每个工作班在每部织布机上可以多织出七米到十米的布。
    维契诺娃的第二个方法，是正确完美地组织自己的劳动方法。她非常关心机器，经常给机器上油，不断注视梭子和其他部件的工作质量。过去一般认为这是副工长的责任，现在维契诺娃自己担负起来了。她接班以后首先就给机器上油，接着就把所有的飞絮收拾干净，检查部件，一切整理就绪后，就开动机器。她非常注意分析各种断线的原因，想尽办法解决这个问题。
    维契诺娃在伊万诺夫州先进纺织工作者集会上说得好：“织布女工的工作是平凡的，但是非常重要的是正确地组织自己的劳动，不断改善劳动方法。”
    她还说：“我总是经常不断地注视纺织工人工作中一切新的事物。”的确，多少年来，她总是随时随地在学习：白天在工厂里向别人学习经验，夜晚在家中埋头读书，研究整个纺织业中的先进事物。
    去年8月，她所管理的织布机，每小时所织的纬线达到一万四千三百多根，把七年计划所规定的水平远远地抛在后面了，9月达到一万四千六百多根，11月达到一万四千七百多根。以后也每月不断上升。她去年10月就完成了全年生产计划，到年底超计划多生产了一万八千米布。
    维契诺娃开辟了纺织业中迅速提前完成七年计划的道路。她所在的工厂正在大力进行机器设备现代化的工作。
    现在，不仅伊万诺夫州，而且全国纺织工厂都在学习维契诺娃的倡议。许多工厂已经达到七年计划设备利用率的水平。
