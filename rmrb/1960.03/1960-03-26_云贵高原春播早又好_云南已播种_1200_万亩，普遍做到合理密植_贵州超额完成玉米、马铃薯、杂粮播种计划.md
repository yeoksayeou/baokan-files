Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 25th:  More than 150 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects and over 120,000 small-scale water conservancy projects in Yunnan Province have been basically completed, increasing the irrigated area from more than 15 million mu to 20 million mu. At present, the accumulated fertilizer in the province guarantees that each mu of major spring crops will be fertilized with approximately 10,000 jin, an increase from approximately 6,000 jin per mu last year. Most of the cultivated land has undergone three plowings and three harrows to four plowings and four harrows, with deep plowing increasing from six inches to about eight inches. The 12 million mu of various crops that have been sown throughout the province have universally achieved reasonable close planting in accordance with local conditions. In order to effectively guarantee the realization of various advanced technologies this year, 61 counties across the province are carrying out a super-production contracting competition, pushing the current spring plowing production, centered on close planting, to a new stage of comprehensive upsurge.

Yunnan Province continues to adhere to the principle of combining "planting more to harvest more" and "high yield to harvest more" in this year's agricultural production, developing grain production at a high speed. In accordance with this requirement, the mass movement to expand cultivated land and organize large-scale high yields is sweeping across the Yunnan Plateau. Since last winter and this spring, more than one million people across the province, under the unified organization of people's communes in various places, have reclaimed 7.4 million mu of wasteland, expanding the province's cultivated land area by 18%. While reclaiming wasteland, the province has also built water conservancy projects that can increase irrigation by 5 million mu of farmland. This year, the planting area of ​​high-yield crops such as rice and corn in the province will be greatly expanded, and 3 million mu of high-yield forage bases will also be opened up. 2.4 million mu of high-yield forage have now been planted. In this way, the feed required for the great development of livestock in Yunnan this year can be fully supplied. This year, the planting area of ​​minor spring crops in Yunnan has also expanded by about 30% compared with last year.

In order to achieve the goal of planting more for high yield, Yunnan is currently carrying out a study, catch-up, and help movement to organize large-scale high yields throughout the province. The province has already established benchmark counties for double harvests of rice and wheat - Fumin County, benchmark counties for large-scale high yield of corn - Luquan and Xuanwei Counties, benchmark counties for double harvests of grain and livestock - Xundian Hui Autonomous County and Changning County, and benchmark counties for vigorously engaging in planting more for multiple harvests and high yield for multiple harvests - Lanping and Xichou Counties. In Wenshan, Honghe, Simao and other places in the southern region, the goal this year is to change from a single season to a double season and three crops a year. Xichou County is working hard this year to re-cultivate, interplant, and intercrop, changing two crops a year to three crops, so that the multiple cropping index reaches 166%. Various basic farmland construction projects such as improving soil, leveling land, and building water conservancy projects are also being carried out very well.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 25th: Guizhou Province, where spring planting started one solar term earlier than last year, has now completed 7.6% to 37% above the planned planting areas for corn, miscellaneous grains, and potatoes, respectively. The area for rice seedling cultivation has also increased seven times compared with the same period last year. Early corn and spring potatoes in Chishui, Wangmo, Luodian and other counties with earlier seasons have grown five or six true leaves, with full and strong seedlings.

The quality of spring plowing and planting work in Guizhou Province this year is very good. All 8 million mu of corn land in the province have been deeply plowed, and 5,000 to 6,000 jin of high-quality base fertilizer have been applied per mu, with some reaching more than 10,000 jin; the degree of close planting generally has a row spacing of one chi and five cun, and a plant spacing of one chi to one chi and two cun, with 2,000 to 3,000 holes and 4,000 to 6,000 plants planted per mu. The improved varieties of major spring-sown crops in various places generally account for more than 80%, and methods such as soaking grain seeds with baking soda, mixing corn seeds with tung oil and lime, soaking seeds in warm water, and disinfecting with chemicals are adopted to strictly treat seeds.

Seizing the early opportunity is an important experience that Guizhou Province has gained in achieving comprehensive agricultural production increases since 1958. Since last winter, various places have made full preparations for spring plowing and planting in terms of manpower and materials. Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture broke the conventional practice of sowing after the "Start of Insects" and began planting early corn in large areas during the "Rain Water" period. The prefecture exceeded its spring sowing plan by 80.3% while overfulfilling its water conservancy construction tasks and carrying out crash fertilizer accumulation, and the quality met the requirements. Due to the complex natural conditions and the large differences in mountain climates in Guizhou.

Planting early while planting enough is another characteristic of spring sowing in Guizhou Province this year. Various places have adopted measures such as mixed forest-grain cultivation, intercropping and interplanting, utilizing fragmented land, and reclaiming wasteland under the principle of not affecting soil and water conservation, effectively increasing the multiple cropping index and expanding the area of spring planting. In Bijie Prefecture, more than 70% of early spring crops are intercropped with melons and beans. Zunyi Prefecture has utilized idle land to plant 160,000 mu of green beans alone. In Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, the area of mixed forest-grain cultivation reached more than 950,000 mu, of which Jinping, Liping, Kaili, Jianhe and other counties expanded the area of mixed forest-grain cultivation by one to nine times compared with last year.

    云贵高原春播早又好
    云南已播种1200万亩，普遍做到合理密植
    贵州超额完成玉米、马铃薯、杂粮播种计划
    据新华社昆明25日电　云南省一百五十多项大、中型水利和十二万多处小型水利工程已基本完成，灌溉面积由一千五百多万亩增加到两千万亩。目前，全省已积的肥料保证每亩大春作物由去年每亩施肥六千斤左右提高到一万斤，大部分耕地都经过三犁三耙至四犁四耙，深耕由六寸提高到八寸左右。全省现已播种的一千二百多万亩各种作物，普遍做到了因地制宜、合理密植。为了切实保证今年各项先进技术的实现，全省六十一个县正在开展一个超包产竞赛运动，把当前以密植为中心的春耕生产正推向一个全面高涨的新阶段。
    云南省在今年的农业生产中继续坚持贯彻“多种多收”和“高产多收”相结合的方针，高速度地发展粮食生产。根据这一要求，目前扩大耕地和组织大面积高产的群众运动正席卷云南高原。去冬今春全省一百多万人在各地人民公社统一组织下，已开垦荒地七百四十万亩，使全省耕地面积扩大了18％。在开荒的同时，全省还兴修了可以增灌五百万亩田地的水利工程。今年全省水稻、玉米等高产作物的种植面积将有很大扩大，同时还开辟了三百万亩高产饲料基地，现在已种下高产饲料二百四十万亩。这样今年云南牲畜大发展所需的饲料可以得到充分的供应。今年云南小春作物种植面积也较去年扩大了30％左右。
    为了达到多种高产的目的，目前云南全省正在开展一个组织大面积高产的学、赶、帮运动，全省已经树起了稻麦双丰收的标兵县——富民县，包谷大面积高产的标兵县——禄劝、宣威等县，粮畜双丰收的标兵县——寻甸回族自治县和昌宁县，大搞多种多收和高产多收的标兵县——兰坪和西畴县等。南部地区的文山、红河、思茅等地，今年要改单季为双季和一年三熟。西畴县今年大干复种、间种、套种，变一年两熟为三熟，使复种指数达到166％。各项农田基本建设如改良土壤、平整土地、兴修水利等也都进行得很好。
    据新华社贵阳25日电　春播时间比去年提早一个节令的贵州省，现在已经分别超额7．6％到37％完成了玉米、杂粮、马铃薯的播种计划。水稻育秧面积也比去年同期增长了七倍。季节较早的赤水、望谟、罗甸等县的早玉米、春马铃薯已长出五、六片真叶，苗全苗壮。
    今年贵州省春耕播种工作的质量非常好。全省八百多万亩玉米地都进行了深耕，每亩施了优质底肥五、六千斤，多的达到万斤以上；密植程度一般行距一尺五寸，窝距一尺到一尺二寸，每亩种二千到三千窝、四千到六千株。各地主要的春播作物，良种面积一般达80％以上，并分别采取了小苏打浸谷种、桐油石灰拌玉米种、温汤浸种和药剂消毒等办法，严格地进行了种子处理。
    抓早，是贵州省1958年以来取得农业全面增产的一条重要经验。各地从去年冬天开始就从人力、物力等方面，为春耕播种作了充分的准备。黔东南苗族侗族自治州打破了往年“惊蛰”下种常规，“雨水”就大种早玉米，全州在超额完成水利兴修任务和突击积肥同时，还超额80．3％完成了春播计划，质量符合要求。由于贵州自然条件复杂，山区气候差异很大。
    播早同时播足，是贵州省今年春播的又一特点。各地都采取林粮混作、套种间作、利用零星土地和在不影响水土保持的原则下开垦荒地等措施，有效地增加复种指数、扩大了春播种植面积。毕节专区70％以上的早春作物套种了瓜豆，遵义专区利用闲散土地，仅种四季豆一项就达十六万亩，黔东南苗族侗族自治州林粮混作面积达九十五万多亩，其中锦屏、黎平、凯里、剑河等县，林粮混作面积分别比去年扩大一至九倍。
