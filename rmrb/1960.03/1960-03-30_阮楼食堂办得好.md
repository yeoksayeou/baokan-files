	The Ruanlou Canteen is Well-Managed
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Xiangren

	The Ruanlou Canteen of the Yuanqiang Commune in Taihe County, Anhui Province, is one of the earliest rural public canteens established. Because the leadership of the canteen was firmly in the hands of poor and lower-middle peasants from the beginning, and the principle of "actively running well and voluntary participation" was resolutely implemented, the canteen has been continuously consolidated and improved, becoming better and better, and becoming a red banner for rural public canteens in the province. It was recently awarded the honorary title of National "March 8th" Advanced Collective.

	In the two years since its opening, this canteen has conscientiously made good arrangements for life and provided meticulous care for the lives of the masses, and has become a warm family for the members of the Ruanlou Production Team. The reporter visited many commune members, and they all said that the canteen staff treated them like relatives. When female commune member Fu Xinzhi was about to marry a wife for her son, and her husband was not at home, she was worried that she would be too busy to handle the wedding alone. The canteen staff helped her solve this problem perfectly. On the day of her son's wedding, the canteen used its own fish, chickens, ducks and self-grown vegetables to prepare a fairly rich banquet for her family. Fu Xinzhi spent only a few yuan to make more than 20 relatives and friends from both families happily drink "wedding wine". In the evening, a wedding ceremony was held in the canteen, and the production team's amateur troupe also performed wonderful entertainment programs, which was very lively. This made Fu Xinzhi and her son Ruan Delou and daughter-in-law Liu Chunying excited to express their determination at the wedding ceremony, promising to actively participate in production to repay the canteen and commune members for their care. The day after the wedding, the whole family went to work and devoted themselves to spring ploughing.

	The reporter was a guest at the home of commune member Ruan Jingxuan. This old man in his fifties had been bedridden for a long time due to chronic illness, and no one at home to take care of him. The canteen cook delivered food and water to him every day, and often asked doctors to see him, wash his clothes, and clean his room. He said to the reporter: "I am a poor peasant. Before liberation, I had nothing to eat when I was sick. Now that I am sick, the canteen takes care of me like this. Even my own mother is not as good as the canteen!" When women give birth, the canteen also specially supplies fine noodles and eggs. In the current spring ploughing and production campaign, in order to enable commune members to eat in the fields, the canteen specially made insulated food delivery vehicles. Because the canteen takes care of the commune members in every possible way, the commune members enthusiastically sing praises of the canteen: "The commune canteen is a flower, loved by men, women, old and young; cooking together is good in every way, the canteen feeds and warms ten thousand families."

	Because the canteen has comprehensively arranged the lives of the commune members, it has enabled the commune members to concentrate on production without any worries, greatly encouraging the production enthusiasm of the commune members. According to statistics, the attendance rate of the whole team has increased from 74% before the canteen was established to 98%. At the same time, collective dining ensures that work is done in unison, which also greatly improves labor efficiency. With the increase in the number of commune members involved in production, the production of the whole team has achieved a leap forward. Last year, this team achieved a bumper harvest with an average yield of 1,324 jin per mu. This year, various productions of the whole team have shown a better and more comprehensive leap forward situation than last year. All 165 mu of wheat in the whole team are first-class seedlings. The spring planting area of the whole team this year has expanded by 50% compared with last year. The commune members sang: "The commune runs the canteen, the old and young are happy, no worries about food and drink, great enthusiasm, and the grain piles grow higher every year."

	The canteen not only promoted the development of production, but also promoted the development of other undertakings in the commune, and became the center of political, economic and cultural activities of the production team. The reporter participated in a whole day of activities in this canteen. It was observed that the commune members used the half-hour gap before and after the three meals a day to turn the dining table into a desk, study culture, and read newspapers and books; some were concentrating on listening to the domestic and foreign news broadcast on the wired broadcast, and did not leave the canteen until the production team blew the whistle to gather for production. When night fell, the canteen was brightly lit, and all 47 young and middle-aged people in the team went to the canteen for cultural lessons.

	The reason why the canteen of this production team is well-managed is because the staff of the canteen have a good service attitude. The director of the canteen, the accountant, and the two cooks are all from poor peasant backgrounds. They are selfless, treat everyone, including their closest relatives, equally, and are also active and hardworking, and know how to arrange life. They get up before dawn every day and sleep late at night, working hard to cook for the commune members. They said: "Seeing the commune members eating happily in the canteen, we forget our fatigue and are full of energy."

	This canteen relies on the masses in everything and has well implemented the principle of democratic management. Sang Chaolan, the director of the canteen, also frequently visits households to solicit opinions from commune members. The walls of the canteen are covered with notes. Some are the published food bills, and some are criticisms and suggestions from commune members on the work of the canteen.

	The Ruanlou Canteen engages in its own non-staple food production, which not only improves the lives of the commune members, but also increases income. This canteen now grows 24 mu of vegetables. In addition to ensuring that all 141 commune members in the team have vegetables to eat at every meal throughout the year, it also sold more than 30,000 jin of vegetables last year. The canteen also raises 200,000 fish, 94 pigs, 540 chickens, 374 ducks, 74 sheep, and 173 rabbits. Last year, in addition to overfulfilling the state-stipulated task of selling poultry and livestock by more than four times, each commune member also ate an average of one jin of pork and half a jin of fish per month.

### 阮楼食堂办得好

    阮楼食堂办得好
    新华社记者　李祥仁
    安徽省最早办起的农村公共食堂之一——太和县原墙公社阮楼食堂，由于食堂的领导权一开始就牢固地掌握在贫农、下中农手中，而且坚决贯彻了“积极办好、自愿参加”的原则，食堂不断巩固提高，越办越好，成为全省农村公共食堂的一面红旗，最近又荣获了全国“三八”先进集体的光荣称号。
    这个食堂开办两年来，切实做好了生活安排，对群众生活上照顾无微不至，已成为阮楼生产队社员一个温暖的大家庭。记者访问了许多社员，他们都说食堂人员待自己有如亲人。女社员傅新芝要给儿子娶媳妇，她丈夫又不在家，正愁着一个人办喜事忙不开。这个困难由食堂人员帮助她圆满地解决了。她儿子结婚的那一天，食堂用自己养的鱼、喂的鸡鸭和自种的蔬菜，给她家办了一桌相当丰富的酒席。傅新芝只花了几块钱，就使婆媳两家的二十多名亲朋故旧高高兴兴地喝了“喜酒”。晚上又在食堂举行了婚礼，生产队的业余剧团还演出了精采文娱节目，热闹非凡。这使傅新芝和她的儿子阮德楼、媳妇刘春英激动得一起在婚礼会上表示了决心，保证积极参加生产以报答食堂和社员们对自己的关怀。婚后第二天，全家出勤投入了春耕生产。
    记者在社员阮敬宣家作客。这个五十多岁的老人长期患慢性病卧床不起，家又没人照顾，食堂的炊事员每天给他送饭送水，还经常给他请医生、洗衣服和打扫卫生。他对记者说：“我是个贫农，在解放前生病就没得吃，如今生病，食堂这样照顾我，亲娘也没有食堂好！”遇到妇女生孩子，食堂还特别供应细面、鸡蛋。在当前春耕大生产运动中，为使社员能在地里吃饭，食堂专做了保温送饭车。由于食堂无微不至地照顾社员，社员们热情歌颂食堂道：“公社食堂一枝花，男女老少喜爱它；合伙做饭样样好，食堂饱暖万人家。”
    由于食堂全面安排好了社员生活，使社员们无牵无挂的安心生产，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。据统计，全队劳动出勤率由未办食堂前的74％提高到98％。同时由于集体吃饭，出工做到一致，也大大提高了劳动效率。随着投入生产的社员增多，使全队生产获得了飞跃发展。这个队去年获得平均亩产一千三百二十四斤的大丰收。今年全队各项生产又呈现了比去年更好更全面的跃进形势。全队一百六十五亩小麦都是一类苗。全队今年春种面积比去年扩大了50％。社员们唱道：“公社办食堂，老少喜洋洋，不愁吃喝干劲大，年年粮堆往上长”。
    食堂不但促进了生产的发展，还带动了公社其他事业的发展，成为生产队政治、经济、文化活动的中心。记者在这个食堂参加了一整天的活动，只见社员们利用一天三餐饭的饭前饭后的半小时的空隙，把饭桌变成课桌，学习文化，阅读报纸图书；有的在聚精会神地听有线广播里播送的当天国内外新闻，一直到生产队吹哨子集合去生产才离开食堂。当夜幕降临时，食堂里灯火辉煌，全队四十七名青壮年全部到食堂上文化课。
    这个生产队的食堂所以办的好，是因为食堂的工作人员有良好的服务态度。食堂主任、会计和两个炊事员都是贫农出身，他们大公无私，对自己再亲再近的人都同等看待，而且积极苦干，会安排生活。他们每天都是天不明就起，到深夜才睡，辛辛苦苦地为社员做饭。他们说：“看到社员在食堂里吃的高高兴兴，我们就忘记了疲劳，满身是劲。”
    这个食堂事事依靠群众，很好地实行了民主管理的原则。食堂主任桑朝兰还经常挨户登门访问，征求社员意见。食堂的墙壁上贴满了字条。有的是公布的伙食账，有的是社员对食堂工作的批评和建议。
    阮楼食堂自己搞副食品生产，既改善了社员生活，又增加了收入。这个食堂现种菜二十四亩，除保证了全队一百四十一个社员一年四季顿顿有蔬菜吃以外，去年还售出蔬菜三万多斤。食堂还养了鱼二十万尾、猪九十四头、鸡五百四十只、鸭三百七十四只、羊七十四头、兔一百七十三只。去年除超额四倍以上完成国家规定这个队家禽家畜出售任务外，平均每个社员每月还吃到了一斤猪肉、半斤鱼。
