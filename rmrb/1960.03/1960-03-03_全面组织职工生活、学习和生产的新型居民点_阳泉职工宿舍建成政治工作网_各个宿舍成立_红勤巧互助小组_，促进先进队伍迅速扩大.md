    New Type of Residential Area Comprehensively Organizes Workers' Lives, Study, and Production:
    Yangquan Workers' Dormitories Establish Political Work Network
    "Red Diligent Skillful Mutual Aid Groups" Established in Each Dormitory to Promote Rapid Expansion of Advanced Teams
    Our newspaper Taiyuan, 2nd dispatch: The famous coal mining area, Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, after massively adjusting workers' dormitories in 1958, centered on grassroots production units, has created a set of methods and systems for dormitory area work through continuous development and supplementation, thereby enriching and perfecting the experience of dormitory adjustment. Now, workers' dormitory areas in various factories and mines throughout the city have developed into new types of residential areas that comprehensively organize workers' production, life, and cultural and technical education.
    In the past two years, Yangquan City's industrial and mining enterprises have added a large number of new workers, and production labor organization has also been constantly changing. In response to this situation, the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly organized various factories and mines to make multiple adjustments to workers' dormitories. On this basis, it established a complete political and ideological work network, including "One Department (Club), Two Rooms (Library, Exhibition Room), Three Schools (Party School, Communist Youth League School, Political School), Four Bigs (Big airing, Big Letting off steam, Big Debates, Big-character posters), Five Samenesses (Same eating, Same living, Same entertainment, Same studying, Same labor)," and cultural and technical learning organizations, so that each dormitory area is not only a place for workers to live, but also a "school" for learning politics and cultural science and technology. At the same time, the "Five Samenesses" system of leaders at all levels and workers has also been newly developed, not only understanding the masses but also systematically helping them. Last year, the Party committees of various factories and mines in Yangquan City used this complete political and ideological work network to organize workers to conduct big airing, big letting off steam, posting big-character posters, and holding debates on various major issues, constantly improving workers' class consciousness. Workers felt happy and energetic, greatly promoting production. In order to meet the needs of workers' political, cultural, and technical learning, in the adjustment of dormitories, attention was paid to distributing Party members, Communist Youth League members, activists, and skilled old workers to various dormitories in a planned way, under the condition of not disrupting the division of accommodation by production units, according to the workers' political, technical, and cultural levels. Taking these people as the core, organize the "Red Diligent Skillful Mutual Aid Group" in each dormitory to help each other, learn from each other's strengths, and improve together. This approach effectively promoted the "Red Diligent Skillful" competition, making the ranks of advanced collectives and advanced producers rapidly grow. A new atmosphere of going down the well to carry out competitions, going home to conduct evaluations, and unity and mutual assistance has generally appeared in the dormitory areas. After the establishment of "Red Diligent Skillful Mutual Aid Groups" in the dormitory areas of the Third Mine, many old workers used recollection comparisons and on-site exhibitions to educate new workers and improve their class consciousness. Through the activities of the "Red Diligent Skillful Groups," 80% of the old workers signed apprenticeship contracts with new apprentices in the same room. With the help of the old workers, after a year, 50% of the new apprentices reached the technical level of grades three to five.
    The dormitory front not only comprehensively carries out political and cultural and technical education for the vast number of workers, but also uses the conditions of centralized accommodation to establish "Dormitory Area Economic Activity Analysis Meetings," "Dormitory Area Rationalization Proposal Committees," and "Advanced Experience Exchange Meetings," mobilizing workers to participate in enterprise management and promoting the continuous improvement of enterprise management. The production conditions of the third coal mining team and the fifth coal mining team of the No. 1 well of the Third Mine are basically the same, but the production cost of the fifth team is higher than that of the third team. The "Dormitory Area Economic Activity Analysis Meeting" then conducted research and introduced experience to the fifth team, so that the cost of the fifth team immediately decreased by 50%. In order to break through the weak link of backward transportation, the electromechanical workers of the Fourth Mine formed a professional research group in the dormitory area. As a result, they continuously created and improved more than 30 types of machinery, greatly improving the transportation level.

    全面组织职工生活、学习和生产的新型居民点
    阳泉职工宿舍建成政治工作网
    各个宿舍成立“红勤巧互助小组”，促进先进队伍迅速扩大
    本报太原2日电　著名煤矿区山西省阳泉市，在1958年以基层生产单位为中心，大规模地调整职工宿舍以后，经过不断发展和补充，创造了一套宿舍区工作的方法和制度，从而使调整宿舍的经验更加充实和完备。现在，全市各厂矿职工宿舍区，已经发展成为全面组织职工生产、生活和进行文化、技术教育的新型居民点。
    阳泉市各工矿企业两年来增加了大批新工人，生产劳动组织也随之不断变动。中共阳泉市委针对这种情况，及时组织各厂矿对职工宿舍进行多次调整。并在这个基础上，建立起包括“一部（俱乐部）、二室（图书室、展览室）、三校（党校、团校、政治学校）、四大（大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报）、五同（同吃、同住、同娱乐、同学习、同劳动）”的整套的政治思想工作网，和文化技术学习的组织，使每个宿舍区不仅是工人住宿的地方，也是学习政治和文化科学技术的“学校”。同时，各级领导干部和工人的“五同”制度也有了新的发展，不但了解群众，而且能系统地帮助群众。去年，阳泉市各厂矿党委运用这个完整的政治思想工作网，组织职工对各项重大问题进行大鸣大放，贴大字报和开辩论会，不断提高工人的阶级觉悟，工人心情舒畅，干劲充沛，大大促进了生产。为了适应职工政治、文化和技术学习的要求，在调整宿舍中，注意了在不打乱生产单位划分住宿的条件下，根据职工政治、技术和文化水平，把党员、团员、积极分子和有技术的老工人，有计划地分布到各宿舍。以这些人为核心，组织各宿舍的“红勤巧互助小组”，相互帮助、取长补短、共同提高。这种作法，有效地推动了红勤巧竞赛运动，使先进集体和先进生产者的队伍迅速壮大。各宿舍区普遍出现了下井搞竞赛、回家搞评比、团结互助的新风尚。三矿各宿舍区成立“红勤巧互助小组”后，许多老工人用回忆对比、现场展览的方法教育新工人，提高他们的阶级觉悟。经过“红勤巧小组”的活动，有80％的老工人和同屋的新徒工订了师徒合同，在老工人的帮助下，经过一年的时间，就有50％的新徒工达到三级到五级工的技术水平。
    宿舍阵地不仅对广大职工全面进行政治和文化技术教育，而且利用集中住宿的条件，建立了“宿舍区经济活动分析会”、“宿舍区合理化建议委员会”、“先进经验交流会”，发动工人参加企业管理工作，促进了企业管理工作的不断的改进。三矿一号井第三采煤队和第五采煤队，生产条件基本相同，但五队比三队生产成本高，“宿舍区经济活动分析会”便进行研究，向五队介绍经验，使五队成本马上降低了50％。四矿机电工人为突破运输落后的薄弱环节，在宿舍区组成专业研究小组，结果连续创制和改进了三十多项机具，大大提高了运输水平。
