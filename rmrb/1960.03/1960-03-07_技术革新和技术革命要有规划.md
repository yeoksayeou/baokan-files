    Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution Must Have Planning

    In the vigorous movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, Party committees in many places have made comprehensive plans and organized the broad masses of people to advance bravely towards the goals set by the technological revolution plan, making technological innovation and technological revolution a mass movement with more leadership and organization. Not long ago, we successively published news about Hebei and Yinchuan, Ningxia formulating comprehensive plans and carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements. Now, Taiyuan City and many enterprises in Liaoning, Guangdong, and Guizhou have also formulated plans and determined goals, guiding the technological innovation and technological revolution movement to a climax. This is a good experience in leading the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

    Comprehensive planning is an important leadership method often advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong. We must have a goal in doing anything, we must foresee the problems that may arise in the process of achieving this goal, and determine the guidelines, policies, and measures to solve these problems. Only in this way can we take the initiative, which requires a plan. Especially for a widespread mass movement like the current technological innovation and technological revolution, a comprehensive plan is especially needed. In this nationwide movement, not only industry should engage in it on a large scale, but also agriculture; not only the transportation industry, but also the commerce and service industries; all sectors should engage in it on a large scale. The tasks undertaken by this movement are also extremely huge. It is not just to innovate the technical face of a certain process, a certain equipment, a certain enterprise, or a certain industry, but to change the backward technical face of manual operations, which accounts for a large proportion in all walks of life. Such a great technological innovation and technological revolution movement will inevitably affect and promote the innovation of labor organization and production management, and will inevitably trigger a high tide of cultural revolution. Without comprehensive planning and lacking foresight, it would be difficult to organize such a widespread mass movement and successfully complete the huge task of changing manual operations to mechanical operations in all walks of life.

    Formulating plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements must be closely integrated with current production. The technological innovation and technological revolution movement serves production, and its spearhead must point to the key problems of production and be closely integrated with production. Only by directing the spearhead of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement directly at the key to production can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in innovating production technology and rapidly promote the development of production. Otherwise, if we shoot here and shoot there without hitting the key point, the enthusiasm of the masses will be affected, and the technological innovation and technological revolution movement cannot be fully carried out, and it is impossible to play a greater role in promoting production. The plans formulated in many places focus on realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and put forward different requirements according to the different situations of different enterprises, which is very important. The mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is the center of the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement. At the same time, in all enterprises where it is necessary and possible, a technological revolution movement of semi-automation and automation should also be launched.

    The technological innovation and technological revolution movement is a broad and profound nationwide mass movement. With the widespread and in-depth development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement from point to area, from several industries to all walks of life, from shallow to deep, and from low-level to high-level, a series of new problems will inevitably arise. In addition to the corresponding adjustment of production relations and the superstructure to adapt to the development of productive forces, many new requirements will also be put forward in terms of material technology. For example, due to the widespread implementation of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, the demand for equipment, materials, and electricity will inevitably increase greatly, and the cultural and technical level of workers also needs to be correspondingly improved; due to the development of production, the demand for raw materials, materials, and fuels will inevitably increase greatly. When compiling plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements, we must foresee these new problems, make arrangements as early as possible, and propose correct ways to solve these problems. Experience has proved that the most important way to solve these problems is self-reliance. The planning of technological innovation and technological revolution should be based on self-reliance to achieve gradual realization. The country's assistance and the support and collaboration of brother departments are of course important, but the most important thing is self-reliance. Only by looking inward, not outward, and relying mainly on self-reliance, combined with the country's assistance and the support and collaboration of brother departments, can we solve the new problems that continue to arise in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement and rapidly implement the plans for technological innovation and technological revolution. Therefore, in solving the problem of equipment and materials, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods. If mechanization and semi-mechanization and even automation and semi-automation can be realized with foreign methods and foreign equipment, then foreign methods and foreign equipment should be used; if there are no foreign methods and foreign equipment, do not wait, first use indigenous methods and indigenous equipment, and then develop from indigenous to foreign when conditions are ripe; in solving the problem of raw materials, we must try our best to save use, make full use of waste and old materials and stagnant materials, find substitutes, expand the source of raw materials, and study the comprehensive utilization of materials; in improving the cultural and technical level of workers, we must run spare-time schools on a large scale, run short-term training classes, and mobilize more masters to train more apprentices.

    Formulating plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements is a process of "from the masses, to the masses." "From the masses, to the masses" is a famous formula created by Comrade Mao Zedong by applying Marxist epistemology to practical work, and it is a mass line working method that must be implemented in all work. Compiling plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements is no exception. What are the key points of production? Where is the potential of production? The broad masses of workers who have been engaged in production practice for many years understand it best and can also put forward the most practical and effective measures to overcome these key points of production and tap the potential. We must mobilize the masses to explore potential and propose measures, and concentrate the opinions of the masses. Only then can the plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements be practical and feasible. "Building a car behind closed doors" will definitely not be able to make a good plan. After the plan is drawn up, it must be taken to the masses, mobilize the masses to discuss, revise, and implement it. Relying on the strength of a few people will also make it impossible to rapidly implement the plan. Many places have gone through the process of coming from the masses and going to the masses in formulating plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements, and there are many new experiences. For example, layer-by-layer discussions and layer-by-layer planning make the plan have a broader mass base; adopting the method of phased operations to realize the plan gives the broad masses a clearer goal at each stage. These are all mass line working methods, and all localities can refer to them when compiling and implementing plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements.

    Formulating plans for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements is a matter of great urgency. It is hoped that all places that have not yet started this work or are in the process of doing so will immediately seize the time and quickly make a plan for a city or a factory to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution movements, so that the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations can advance more vigorously towards higher goals with more leadership and organization!

### 技术革新和技术革命要有规划

    技术革新和技术革命要有规划
    在轰轰烈烈的以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多地方的党委都做出全面规划，组织广大人民群众朝着技术革命规划所制定的目标奋勇前进，使技术革新和技术革命成为一个更有领导、更有组织的群众运动。不久以前，我们先后发表了河北各地和宁夏银川市制订全面规划、开展技术革新和技术革命运动的新闻，现在，太原市以及辽宁、广东、贵州的许多企业也都制订规划，确定目标，把技术革新和技术革命运动导向高潮。这是领导技术革新和技术革命运动的一个好的经验。
    全面规划，这是毛泽东同志经常倡导的一项重要的领导方法。我们做任何事情都要有一个目标，都要预见到在实现这个目标的过程中可能发生的问题，确定解决这些问题的方针、政策和措施，只有这样，才能掌握主动，这就需要有一个规划。特别是像当前技术革新和技术革命这样广泛的群众运动，尤其需要有全面的规划。在这个全民性的运动中，不仅工业要大搞，农业也要大搞，不仅运输业要大搞，商业、服务行业也要大搞，各行各业都要大搞。这个运动所肩负的任务也是极其巨大的。它不只是要革新某一个工序、某一种设备、某一个企业和某一个行业的技术面貌，而且是要改变在各行各业中都占有很大比重的手工操作的落后技术面貌。这样一个伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动，又必然要影响和推动劳动组织的革新，生产管理的革新，并且必然要引起一个文化革命的高潮。如果没有全面规划，缺乏高瞻远瞩，就很难把这样一个广泛的群众运动组织起来，圆满地完成各行各业改变手工操作为机械操作的巨大任务。
    制订开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划，必须紧密结合当前的生产。技术革新和技术革命运动是为生产服务的，它的矛头必须指向生产的关键问题，紧密地同生产相结合。只有把技术革新和技术革命运动的矛头直指生产关键，才能把广大群众革新生产技术的积极性和创造性充分调动起来，迅速推动生产的发展。否则，东放一枪，西放一枪，打不中要害，群众的积极性就要受到影响，技术革新和技术革命运动也就不可能充分地开展，不可能在促进生产中发挥更大的作用。许多地方制订的规划，都以实现手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心，并针对不同企业的不同情况提出了不同的要求，这是很重要的。手工操作机械化和半机械化是当前技术革新和技术革命运动的中心。同时，在一切有必要和有可能的企业，也应当展开半自动化和自动化的技术革命运动。
    技术革新和技术革命运动是一个广泛的、深刻的全民性的群众运动，随着技术革新和技术革命运动由点到面、由几个行业到各行各业、由浅入深、由低级到高级地广泛深入的发展，必然会出现一系列新的问题。除了适应生产力的发展，生产关系和上层建筑要有相适应的调整以外，在物质技术上也会提出许多新的要求。例如，由于手工操作广泛实行机械化和半机械化，设备器材和电力的需要必然大为增加，工人的文化技术水平也需要有相应的提高；由于生产的发展，原料、材料、燃料的需要也必然会有很大的增加。在编制开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划时，都要预见到这些新的问题，及早安排，提出解决这些问题的正确途径。经验证明，解决这些问题的最重要途径是自力更生。技术革新和技术革命的规划，都应当建立在自力更生的基础上求得逐步实现。国家的帮助，兄弟部门的支援和协作，当然都是重要的，但是最重要的还是自力更生。只有眼睛朝内，而不是眼睛朝外，以自力更生为主，结合国家的帮助和兄弟部门的支援协作，才能解决技术革新和技术革命运动中不断出现的新的问题，使技术革新和技术革命运动的规划迅速付诸实现。因此，在解决设备器材的问题上，要坚决贯彻洋土并举的方针，能用洋办法、洋设备实现机械化和半机械化以至自动化和半自动化，就用洋办法和洋设备；没有洋办法和洋设备，决不要等待，先用土办法、土设备，待到条件成熟，再由土到洋发展；在解决原材料的问题上，要千方百计地节约使用，充分利用废旧材料和呆滞物资，寻找代用品，扩大原料的来源，研究物资的综合利用；在提高工人的文化技术水平方面，要大办业余学校，开办短期训练班，动员更多的师傅培养更多的徒弟。
    制订开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划，是一个“从群众中来，到群众中去”的过程。“从群众中来，到群众中去”，是毛泽东同志把马克思主义的认识论运用于实际工作所创造的一个著名的公式，是在一切工作中都要实行的群众路线的工作方法。编制开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划也不例外。生产的关键是什么？生产的潜力在哪里？长年累月从事生产实践的广大职工了解得最清楚，也最能提出切实有效的措施，攻克这些生产关键，把潜力挖掘出来。必须发动群众，摸潜力、提措施，把群众的意见集中起来，开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划才是切实的，可行的。“闭门造车”，一定不能把规划订好。规划订出来以后，还要拿到群众中去，发动群众讨论、修改、贯彻执行。依靠少数人的力量，也是不可能使规划迅速付诸实现的。许多地方制订开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划，都经过了从群众中来到群众中去的过程，并且有不少新的经验。例如，层层讨论，层层规划，就使规划有更广泛的群众基础；采用分段作战的办法来实现规划，就使广大群众在每一个阶段都有更明确的目标。这些都是群众路线的工作方法，各地在编制和贯彻开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划时，可以参考。
    制订开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划，是当务之急。希望一切还没有着手这项工作或者正在进行这项工作的地方，都立即抓紧，迅速做出一个市、一个厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划，使当前以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，更有领导、更有组织地朝更高的目标勇猛前进！
