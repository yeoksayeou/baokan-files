    New Conspiracy of Belgian Colonists in Congo

    Belgian Congo will achieve independence on June 30 this year. However, many signs indicate that Belgian colonists are still trying their best to maintain their colonial rule in Congo.

    The Belgian colonists' agreement to Congolese independence was a reluctant action taken under the irresistible circumstances of the Congolese national independence struggle. Since the Congolese people launched a large-scale riot in Leopoldville in January last year, although the Belgian colonial authorities have adopted repressive measures such as arrests, torture, and massacres, as well as political deception, the Congolese people's struggles such as resistance to taxes, demonstrations, and strikes have continued to occur. The Congolese people also resolutely opposed the deceptive plan of "independence in stages" put forward by the Belgian government in order to maintain its colonial status, and effectively resisted the so-called "elections" that the colonialists originally planned to conduct in December last year, so that the Belgian colonists were finally forced to agree to negotiate the issue of independence with the Congolese people. At the round table conference on the political future of the Congo, which was held not long ago in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, the Belgian government still played many conspiracies and tricks. At the beginning of the meeting, the Belgian government attempted to make this meeting merely one of "providing information" without making any decisions. Later, it engaged in divisive activities among African representatives. In order to maintain the privileges of plundering Congolese resources, Belgian monopoly consortia conspired to divide Congolese territory, attempting to separate the richest Katanga Province from the Congo. However, due to the unity of the representatives of various Congolese nationalist parties, who formed a united front, the Belgian colonists' conspiracy ultimately failed, and they had no choice but to agree to Congo's independence on June 30.

    Although the Belgian colonists have been forced to agree to Congolese independence, they are still attempting to maintain their privileges politically and continue to control the Congo economically. There are reports that the King of Belgium even intends to serve as the head of state of the independent Congo. The Belgian authorities have not given the Congolese people basic freedoms, and the Belgian government still keeps thousands of Congolese people in prisons. The Belgian military bases in the Congo may still be used to suppress the Congolese people, and the Belgian government is constantly airlifting paratroopers to reinforce military bases in the Congo. At the same time, the Belgian colonists are also attempting to maintain the Belgian financial groups' economic control over the Congo by reaching so-called technical "aid" and financial "aid" agreements with the Congo.

    The conflict that the Belgian colonial authorities created in Katanga Province this time further shows that the colonialists are by no means willing to give up colonial rule, and they will set up various obstacles on the road for the Congolese people to strive for independence. However, it is believed that the Congolese people, who have waged a long and heroic struggle for national independence, will surely defeat all the conspiracies of the Belgian colonists and achieve final victory.

    比利时殖民者在刚果的新阴谋
    比属刚果将在今年6月30日取得独立。但是，很多迹象表明，比利时殖民者仍然千方百计力图保持他们在刚果的殖民统治。
    比利时殖民者同意刚果独立，是在刚果民族独立斗争势不可当的情势下所采取的不得已行动。自从去年1月刚果人民在利奥波德维尔发动大规模的暴动以后，比利时殖民当局虽然采用了逮捕、酷刑、屠杀等镇压措施和政治欺骗手段，但是刚果人民抗税、游行、罢工等斗争还是不断地发生。刚果人民还坚决地反对比利时政府为了保持其殖民地位而提出的“分阶段独立”的欺骗性计划，并且有效地抵制了殖民者原来准备在去年12月搞的所谓“选举”，以致比利时殖民者终于被迫
  同意和刚果人民谈判独立的问题。而在不久前于比利时首都布鲁塞尔召开的讨论刚果政治前途的圆桌会议上，比利时政府仍然玩弄了许多阴谋诡计。在会议开始的时候，比利时政府曾经企图把这次会议作为仅仅是“提供情况”而不作出决定的会议。后来，它又在非洲代表之间搞分裂活动。比利时垄断财团为了保持掠夺刚果资源的特权，阴谋分割刚果领土，企图使最富裕的加丹加省脱离刚果。但是，由于刚果各民族主义政党代表团结一致，组成联合阵线，比利时殖民者的阴谋终于没有得逞，只好同意刚果在6月30日独立。
    尽管比利时殖民者已经被迫同意刚果独立，但仍企图在政治上保持它的特权，在经济上继续控制刚果。有消息说，比利时国王竟还有意担任独立后的刚果元首。比利时当局还没有给刚果人民以基本自由，比利时政府仍然把几千名刚果人关在监狱里。比利时在刚果的军事基地还可能被利用来对刚果人民进行镇压，比利时政府不断空运伞兵增援部队到刚果的军事基地去。同时，比利时殖民者还企图通过同刚果达成所谓技术“援助”和财政“援助”等协定，以维持比利时金融集团对刚果的经济控制。
    比利时殖民当局这次在加丹加省制造的冲突事件，进一步表明殖民主义者是决不甘心放弃殖民统治的，他们还将在刚果人民争取独立的道路上设下各种障碍。但是，人们相信，为争取民族独立而已经作了长期英勇斗争的刚果人民，一定会击败比利时殖民者的一切阴谋，取得最后的胜利。
