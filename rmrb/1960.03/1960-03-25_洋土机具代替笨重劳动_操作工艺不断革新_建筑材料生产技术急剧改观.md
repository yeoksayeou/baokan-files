Xinhua News Agency, 24th - The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is rapidly changing the face of the building materials industry. The long-standing extensive manual operation and heavy physical labor are gradually being replaced by machinery; many fundamental reforms in operating techniques are also constantly emerging with the deepening of the movement.

The building materials industry sectors producing cement, glass, ceramics, asbestos products, bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel are particularly reliant on manual operation, with very heavy loading and unloading work. In order to achieve increased production without increasing manpower, and to overfulfill this year's production plans, the vast number of workers in the building materials industry have vigorously promoted the motorization, rail transport, cableway transport, chute transport, and various combinations of imported and indigenous machinery, greatly improving labor efficiency. For example, after the Shanghai Cement Plant realized the mechanization of raw material loading, unloading, and handling, efficiency increased tenfold. Qixin Cement Plant created an electric rake, increasing the efficiency of unloading slag by nearly twenty times. Many enterprises have matched newly created loading and unloading machinery into sets, and some enterprises have even produced automatic transport lines. In the past month or so, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the building materials industry has increased by nearly 10%, freeing a large number of workers from manual operation and heavy physical labor, saving a large amount of labor. In just over a month, Jinxi Cement Plant in Liaoning Province saved more than 140 workers. After rectification, consolidation, and technical transformation of small cement enterprises in Henan Province, nearly 190,000 workers have been saved in recent months. Some of these workers have been transferred to positions in the building materials industry where labor is urgently needed, and some have also supported agricultural production.

While continuing to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, many significant reforms have also been carried out in operating techniques and production processes. For example, the "coal gas firing method" recently successfully tested in the cement industry in Zibo, Shandong, can double cement production using the original equipment and reduce coal consumption by one-third. The Mudanjiang Cement Plant, on the basis of promoting advanced operating methods such as large fire, large wind, large feed, and rapid rotary kilns, further increased the calcination temperature, which not only increased output but also greatly shortened the production cycle. The Beijing Taipingzhuang Brick and Tile Factory created a double-cylinder tunnel kiln, using waste heat to dry brick blanks, changing the situation in the brick and tile industry where it has long been "dependent on the weather" and affected by nature. This fundamental reform in the brick and tile industry can increase output by 75% to 100%. Many significant reforms in operating techniques are now being summarized and further developed, and some have been vigorously promoted nationwide.

    洋土机具代替笨重劳动　操作工艺不断革新
    建筑材料生产技术急剧改观
    新华社24日讯　技术革新和技术革命运动正在使建筑材料工业的面貌迅速改观，长期存在的大量手工操作和笨重体力劳动，已经逐步为机械所代替；操作工艺上许多根本性质的改革，也随着运动的深入不断涌现出来。
    生产水泥、玻璃、陶瓷、石棉制品和砖瓦、砂石的建筑材料工业部门，是手工操作特别多的一个部门，装卸运输工作很繁重。为了实现增产不增人，超额完成今年的生产计划，建筑材料工业中的广大职工大力推行了运输车子化、轨道化、索道化、溜槽化和各种洋土结合的机具，使劳动效率大为提高。例如上海水泥厂实现原料装卸搬运机械化以后，效率提高了十倍。启新水泥厂创造了电耙，使卸矿渣的效率提高近二十倍。许多企业把新创造的装卸机械配成了套，有的企业还制出了自动运输线。在最近的一个多月中，建筑材料工业的机械化、半机械化水平已经提高了近10％，大量工人摆脱了手工操作和笨重的体力劳动，节省出大批劳动力。辽宁省锦西水泥厂在一个多月中，就节省出一百四十多个劳动力。河南省经过对小型水泥企业的整顿巩固和技术改造，近几个月中节省出了十九万个劳动力。这些劳动力，有的已经调往建筑材料工业中急需劳动力的岗位，有的还支援了农业生产。
    在继续大搞机械化、半机械化的同时，还在操作技术和生产工艺方面进行了许多有重大意义的改革。例如，山东淄博最近在水泥工业中试验成功的“煤气烧成法”，可以用原来的设备使水泥产量增加一倍，并且能使煤耗减少三分之一。牡丹江水泥厂在推行大火、大风、大料和快速转窑等先进操作方法的基础上，进一步提高焙烧温度，不仅增加了产量，还大大缩短了生产周期。北京太平庄砖瓦厂创造的双筒轮窑，用余热干燥砖坯，改变了砖瓦工业长期“靠天吃饭”、受自然影响的局面。砖瓦工业的这一项根本性质的改革，可以使产量提高75％到一倍。操作工艺方面许多意义重大的改革，现在正在总结和继续发展，有的已在全国大力推广。
