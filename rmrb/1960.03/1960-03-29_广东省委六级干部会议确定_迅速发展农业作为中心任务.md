    Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Six-Level Cadre Meeting Determines
    Rapidly Developing Agriculture as the Central Task

    (Our Newspaper) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a six-level cadre meeting from February 29th to March 9th to discuss the issue of implementing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's determined policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and combining it with the rapid development of agriculture in Guangdong Province. The meeting decided that all Party organizations in Guangdong Province should take the rapid development of agriculture as the central task. The entire Party must use greater strength to grasp agriculture, greatly accelerate the development of agriculture, thereby further promoting the sustained leap forward of industry and the entire national economy. In order to rapidly develop agriculture, in addition to the entire Party further strengthening agriculture, the fundamental solution is to rely on strong industrial support for agriculture and accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. The meeting called on all Party organizations, all Party cadres, and all economic, cultural, educational, and political-legal departments in the province to contribute their strength to the great historical task of realizing the modernization of agriculture.

    Three thousand five hundred cadres from six levels, including the Provincial Party Committee, Prefectural Party Committee, County Party Committee, Commune Party Committee, as well as production brigades and production teams of the communes, participated in the meeting. At the opening of the meeting, Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, first gave important instructions, and Comrade Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a report on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee entitled "Agriculture Must Be Rapidly Developed." During the discussion process of the meeting, Comrade Chen Yu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a report entitled "This Year's Industry Must Continue to Leap Forward in an All-Round Way and Vigorously Support Agriculture." The meeting was finally summarized by Comrade Tao Zhu.

    The meeting believes that taking agriculture as the foundation, implementing the combination of prioritizing the development of heavy industry and rapidly developing agriculture, is a complete socialist construction policy that has been tested by history; it is the only correct policy to ensure the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. Implementing this policy is of particularly important significance for Guangdong. Guangdong is China's main subtropical and tropical region, with extremely favorable conditions for developing agriculture, and is also very conducive to the development of light industry; at the same time, based on Guangdong's underground resources, non-ferrous metals, the chemical industry, and the petroleum industry also have great prospects for development. Since entering the construction phase in 1953, Guangdong has achieved great success in implementing the policy of focusing on agriculture, with grain output doubling compared to before liberation, and driving the industry to also achieve considerable development. However, Guangdong's grain production has not yet passed the hurdle and cannot yet freely develop cash crops and diversified operations. Only by resolutely implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and combining it with the rapid development of agriculture, can the entire Party more prominently grasp agriculture as the central link, rapidly develop agriculture, rely on strong industrial support for agriculture, accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, so that grain can achieve basic self-sufficiency relatively quickly, and at the same time lay a certain foundation for heavy industry. After that, Guangdong can fully leverage the characteristics of its region, vigorously engage in diversified operations in agriculture and freely develop cash crops, especially subtropical crops; on this basis, further develop light industry, develop non-ferrous metals, chemical and petroleum industries.

    The meeting, based on the policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," formulated the main indicators for this year's agricultural production.

    The meeting believes that implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture is the key to completing this year's agricultural production tasks and achieving the continued leap forward of agriculture in the future. The general requirement for agricultural technical transformation is to achieve mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification. The center is mechanization. Before 1962, the entire province must focus on vigorously developing improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools as the center of agricultural technical transformation. Their contents include: the vehicle and boatization of transportation tools, the improvement and semi-mechanization of farming tools, the dynamization of animal husbandry and agricultural product processing tools, the semi-mechanization of farmland infrastructure such as water conservancy construction tools, and the semi-mechanization of tools for forestry, fishery, and canteens; at the same time, according to the characteristics of Guangdong, great efforts should be made to develop hydroelectric stations, local fertilizers, and explosives and put them in important positions.

    In order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, first of all, Party organizations throughout the province are required to unify their understanding, clarify their thinking, deeply understand the great historical significance of agricultural technical transformation, and immediately grasp it as the primary key to realizing this year's continued leap forward. All county and commune machinery factories and farm tool factories should fully serve the technical transformation of agriculture, actively develop the production of agricultural machinery, building materials, local fertilizers, and local explosives, and vigorously develop hydroelectric stations and local power generation, and those with the conditions should also develop small foreign-style oil refining, iron smelting, and coal production to meet the needs of agricultural technical transformation. Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture also requires a large number of technical talents to be trained and a strong technical team to be formed; the work of mechanized demonstration areas must be strengthened. Finally, and most importantly, Party leadership over this work must be strengthened. Party committees at all levels must be headed by the first secretary, personally grasp the technical transformation of agriculture, and use the technical transformation of agriculture to drive the entire work forward. Provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees, and commune Party committees must establish and further strengthen the agricultural technical transformation office.

    The meeting pointed out that in order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and realize the modernization of agriculture as soon as possible, industrial support for agriculture must be greatly strengthened. According to the plan for agricultural technical transformation, the main task of industrial support for agriculture this year is: first, to rapidly build the agricultural machinery industry. It is necessary to seize the construction of a number of backbone factories such as tractor factories, hydro-generator factories, power machinery factories, and irrigation and drainage machinery factories, and at the same time strengthen the construction of farm tool repair and assembly networks in communes and brigades, and rapidly form a provincial agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair and assembly network. Second, vigorously develop chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This year, it is necessary to seize the construction of nitrogen fertilizer plants, phosphate fertilizer plants, calcium phosphate plants, and a number of small fertilizer plants run by various regions, and strive to put them into production quickly. On the other hand, it is necessary to widely adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to produce calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, potassium-magnesium fertilizer, and various other local fertilizers and local pesticides. Third, actively expand the production of raw materials, and strive to produce more steel, cement, wood, and fuel oil to support water conservancy construction and the technical transformation of various agricultural sectors. In addition, it is necessary to actively support the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification in the agricultural demonstration area near Guangzhou, vigorously develop small rural hydropower stations; and actively help agricultural departments train various technical personnel.

    According to the fact that the people's communes throughout the province have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development, the meeting discussed several issues concerning the current work of the people's communes. The meeting believes that the people's commune system will continue to develop from content to form, and the transition from the current socialist collective ownership based on production team ownership to the socialist collective ownership based on commune ownership is an inevitable trend in the development of the people's communes. The transition of the people's communes from basic team ownership to basic commune ownership must have several conditions: a great development of the commune-owned economy, the economic development level between teams has been basically balanced, mechanization and semi-mechanization have been initially realized, the income of commune members has increased significantly, and the socialist consciousness of the masses is higher. It is not possible to force the transition if the conditions are not ripe. At present, the three-level ownership system based on the team is suitable for the current level of production and the degree of consciousness of the masses, and it is conducive to the development of productive forces. In order to gradually develop the economy at the commune level, the commune Party committee must establish the concept of economic accounting, rationally use human, material, and financial resources, be diligent and thrifty, and painstakingly manage commune-run enterprises and undertakings. To this end, the commune level must establish a strict financial management system and financial discipline. Communes should actively help poor teams catch up with rich teams, but rich teams should also be treated equally. Poor teams mainly rely on their own ambition and self-reliance to develop production, and cannot be dependent. Doing a good job in distribution is a major issue related to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. It is required that in handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption, it must be ensured that on the basis of production development and on the premise of appropriately increasing accumulation, the income of commune members will increase significantly year by year. In terms of distribution policy, it is necessary to adhere to the relevant provisions of the central and provincial party committees. The proportion of the supply part should generally not be increased or decreased. For brigades with more income, the increased income should mainly be used to increase wages. For brigades with less income, efforts should be made to increase cash income to ensure the normal payment of wages, and the supply standard should not be lowered. The principle of paying according to labor days should be adhered to when issuing wages. In addition, a rectification movement should be carried out among the commune members at least once a year to strengthen the Party's political and ideological work and continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the masses. All of these are to make the people's communes more consolidated and promote the continued development of production and productive forces; at the same time, they are actively creating conditions for the development of the people's commune system. If this is done, the people's communes throughout the province will be changing with each passing day, and the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production will have a more reliable guarantee.

    The meeting believes that in the face of the new situation and new tasks, the entire Party is required to establish a better work style. This is: a work style with ideals and drive; seeking truth from facts and a scientific attitude; fully following the mass line and caring about the lives of the masses; working hard and simply, burying oneself in hard work, and not caring about personal gains and losses. At the same time, all Party cadres must study hard, think carefully, and further improve their political, theoretical, and professional levels.

    广东省委六级干部会议确定
    迅速发展农业作为中心任务
    本报讯　中共广东省委员会于2月29日至3月9日召开六级干部会议，讨论关于在广东省贯彻执行党中央和毛主席确定的国民经济以农业为基础、优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合的方针问题。会议决定：广东全省党组织把迅速发展农业作为中心任务。全党必须以更大的力量来抓农业，大大加速农业的发展，从而进一步促进工业和整个国民经济的持续跃进。为了迅速发展农业，除了全党进一步加强农业之外，根本的出路是依靠工业对农业的大力支援，加速对农业的技术改造。会议号召全省的党组织、全体党员干部，一切经济、文教、政法部门，一致为实现农业的现代化这一伟大历史任务贡献自己的力量。
    参加这次会议的有省委、地委、县委、公社党委以及公社的生产大队、生产小队六级干部共三千五百人。会议开幕时，省委第一书记陶铸同志首先作了重要指示，省委书记处书记赵紫阳同志代表省委作了“必须迅速发展农业”的报告。在会议讨论过程中，省委书记处书记陈郁同志作了“今年工业要继续全面大跃进，大力支援农业”的报告。会议最后由陶铸同志作总结。
    会议认为：以农业为基础，实行优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合，是一个完整的、经过历史考验的社会主义建设方针；是保证国民经济高速度、按比例发展的唯一正确方针。执行这个方针，对广东来说，具有特别重要的意义。广东是我国主要的亚热带、热带地区，发展农业的条件极其优越，又非常有利于轻工业的发展；同时，根据广东地下资源情况，有色金属、化学工业、石油工业，也有极大的发展前途。从1953年开始进入建设阶段以来，广东实行以农业为重点的方针已经取得了很大的成绩，粮食产量比解放前翻了一番，并带动了工业也获得了长足发展。但是，目前广东粮食还未过关，还不能够放手发展经济作物和多种经营。只有坚决贯彻执行以农业为基础、优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合的方针，全党更加突出地抓住农业这个中心环节，迅速发展农业，依靠工业对农业的大力支援，加速农业的技术改造，使粮食能够比较快地实现基本过关，同时又打下一定的重工业基础以后，广东就可以充分发挥自己地区的特点，在农业上大搞多种经营和放手发展经济作物，特别是亚热带作物；在这基础之上，更大地发展轻工业，发展有色金属、化学和石油工业。
    会议根据“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针，制定了今年农业生产的主要指标。
    会议认为：贯彻土洋并举的方针，加速农业技术改造，是完成今年农业生产任务和今后实现农业持续跃进的关键。农业技术改造总的要求是实现机械化、水利化、电气化。中心是机械化。1962年以前，全省必须以大搞改良农具和半机械化农具作为农业技术改造的中心。它们的内容包括：运输工具的车船化，耕作工具改良化和半机械化，畜牧业、农产品加工工具动力化，农田基建如水利施工工具半机械化，林业、渔业、食堂等用具的半机械化；同时根据广东的特点，应当把大搞水力站、土化肥和炸药放到重要位置。
    为加速农业技术改造，首先要求全省的党组织统一认识，明确思想，深刻了解农业技术改造的伟大历史意义，并立即把它作为实现今年的继续跃进的首要关键狠狠地抓起来。所有县和公社的机械厂和农具厂应当全力为农业技术改造服务，积极发展农业机械、建筑材料、土化肥、土炸药的生产，并大搞水力站和土法办电，有条件的还要发展小洋群的炼油、炼铁、煤炭等生产，以满足农业技术改造的需要。加速农业技术改造，还必须大量培养技术人材，组成强大的技术队伍；必须加强机械化示范区的工作。最后，也是最重要的一条是：必须加强党对这一工作的组织领导。各级党委必须由第一书记挂帅，亲自抓农业技术改造工作，以农业技术改造带动整个工作前进。省、地、县委，公社党委都要成立和进一步加强农业技术改造办公室的机构。
    会议指出，为了加速农业技术改造，尽快实现农业现代化，必须大力加强工业对农业的支援。根据农业技术改造的规划，今年工业支援农业的主要工作是：首先，迅速建设农业机械工业。要抓紧建成拖拉机厂、水轮发电机厂、动力机械厂、排灌机械厂等一批骨干工厂，同时加强公社和大队的农具修配网的建设，迅速形成全省的农业机械制造和修配网。其次，大搞化肥、农药。今年要抓紧氮肥厂、磷肥厂、磷酸钙厂以及各地区所办的一批小型化肥厂的建设，力争迅速投入生产。另一方面，必须广泛采取土洋结合的办法，生产钙镁磷肥、钾镁肥和其它各种土化肥、土农药。第三，积极扩大原材料的生产，力争生产出更多的钢材、水泥、木材和燃料油等，支援水利建设以及农业各部门的技术改造。此外，要积极支援广州附近农业示范区的农业机械化、电气化的实现，大搞农村小型水力发电站；还要积极帮助农业部门培养各种技术人员。
    会议根据全省人民公社已经走上巩固和健全发展的道路这一情况，讨论了关于当前人民公社工作的几个问题。会议认为，人民公社制度从内容到形式都将是不断发展的，由目前的以生产队所有制为基础的社会主义集体所有制过渡到以公社所有制为基础的社会主义集体所有制，是人民公社发展的必然趋势。人民公社由基本队有制转变为基本社有制，必须要具备公社所有经济的很大发展、队与队之间的经济发展水平已基本平衡、初步实现了机械化和半机械化、社员收入有显著增加、群众的社会主义觉悟更高等几个条件。条件不成熟就不能勉强过渡。在目前，以队为基础的三级所有制，是适合于目前的生产水平和群众觉悟程度的，是有利于生产力发展的。为使公社一级经济逐步发展，公社党委必须树立经济核算观点，合理使用人力、物力、财力，克勤克俭，苦心经营社办企业和事业。为此，公社一级必须树立严格的财政管理制度和财政纪律。公社应当积极帮助穷队赶上富队，但对富队也要一视同仁。穷队赶富队主要靠自己树立雄心大志，自力更生，发展生产，而不能有所依赖。搞好分配工作，是关系调动群众的积极性的重大问题。要求在处理积累和消费的关系方面，必须做到在生产发展的基础上和适当增加积累的前提下，使社员的收入逐年有显著的增加。在分配政策方面，必须坚持中央和省委的有关规定，供给部分所占的比例，一般不再增加也不能降低。增加收入较多的大队，增收部分主要用于提高工资。收入不多的大队，则应努力增加现金收入以保证正常发放工资，不能降低供给标准。发放工资应坚持按劳动日付酬的原则。此外，每年至少都要在社员群众中开展一次整风运动，加强党的政治思想工作，不断地提高群众的社会主义觉悟。所有这些，都是使人民公社更加巩固，促进生产和生产力的继续发展；同时，又是为人民公社制度的发展，积极地创造着条件。照此做去，全省的人民公社将会日新月异，农业生产的全面跃进有了更加可靠的保证。
    会议认为，在新的形势和新的任务面前，要求全党树立一种更好的工作作风。这就是：有理想、有干劲；实事求是，科学态度；充分走群众路线，关心群众生活；艰苦朴素，埋头苦干，不计较个人得失的工作作风。同时，全党干部必须努力学习，认真思考，将自己的政治、理论和业务水平进一步地提高起来。
