New Soviet Machines Emerge in Endless Streams
Three Heavy Labor Tasks Achieve Mechanization

    Mechanized Fertilizer Transport: Fast and Cheap
    In a drained swamp, a tractor with a rotating plow drum advances slowly, loosening the peat soil. Behind it follows another tractor, this one equipped with a soil collector. The soil collector uses buckets to gather the loose peat into piles. Then, a suspended loading machine quickly loads the peat into the trailer of another tractor. Finally, the third tractor delivers the peat to the fields.
    This entire set of machines and tools was designed by the Belorussian Institute of Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification in the Soviet Union. They can fully mechanize the heavy agricultural task of fertilizer transport to the fields. Extracting and transporting peat with them is very cheap, costing only a little over two rubles per ton of peat.
    This set of machines is particularly valuable for collective farms and state farms because they can handle the heavy work of loading and transporting fertilizer in agriculture. When designing this set of machines, the designers adopted a series of improvements. The fertilizer loading machine, suspended on a crawler tractor, can rotate and has a hydraulic control device, capable of lifting 750 kilograms of fertilizer each time. The loading machine can load 50 tons of peat or chemical fertilizer per hour using a special fertilizer bucket. If the fertilizer bucket is replaced with a manure fork, this machine can also load manure onto trailers. After the trailer is towed to the field, the tractor driver does not need to get out of the cab; simply turn the control handle, and the trailer bed tips over. This set of self-unloading trailers is designed for tractors of various horsepower, with trailer load capacities ranging from 400 kilograms to 6 tons. They all have hydraulic control devices.

    Machine Harvesting of Castor Beans: Efficiency Increased a Hundredfold
    Not long ago, many machine operators from Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, and other neighboring regions in the Soviet Union came to visit the "Krivorozhye" State Farm. What attracted them here?
    It turns out that the small team leader of the farm, Ovsyannikov, successfully mechanized one of the most labor-intensive tasks in agriculture: the harvesting of castor beans, a crop of great value in medicine, technology, and chemical industry.
    Here, every year, one hundred to one hundred and fifty people had to spend one and a half to two months exclusively picking the prickly castor bean pods. Once a basket was full, it had to be carefully lifted out of the field. Dozens of tractors, cars, and wagons waited longer to be loaded than they did transporting the castor beans. The harvesting cost per hectare was very expensive. Despite this, sometimes as much as a quarter of the harvest was lost.
    But now, all the castor bean fields have been harvested... by just one person in twenty days. The rationalization proposer modified a "CK-3" type grain combine harvester for this purpose. Only two cars served it. As a result, the harvesting cost per hectare was reduced by thirty-four times. Losses are almost nonexistent because harvesting continues until the castor bean plants are fully mature.
    State farms in the Dnepropetrovsk region have already modified the necessary number of grain combine harvesters to harvest castor beans in all plantations. This saves the country more than one million rubles. At the same time, the planting area of this valuable technical crop can be expanded several times in the future.

    New Tea Plucking Machine: Automatically Selects Tender Tea Leaves
    Under the scorching southern sun, hundreds of women are bent over the green bushes. Looking from behind the bushes, only their backs and sun-shading wide-brimmed straw hats can be seen. This is tea plucking.
    Plucking tea is not an easy task. A tea picker can pluck about forty thousand tender leaves a day, averaging a total of twenty to thirty kilograms of tea. Picking one hectare of tea requires four hundred workers.
    How to alleviate the labor of tea pickers? Scientists at the Sochi Experimental Station (Northern Caucasus, Soviet Union) have been considering this issue for a long time. Not long ago, their creative exploration finally succeeded. They designed and manufactured a new type of tea plucking machine called "чу—1, ВЩ".
    The tea plucking device of this machine resembles a curved comb straddling the tea bushes. It can distinguish between old leaves and tender leaves, plucking only the pluckable tender leaves without damaging the unpluckable tender buds.
    The tea plucking device is mounted on a self-propelled chassis. Its average production capacity is 40 kilograms of tea per hour. This is about nine times more tea than the most excellent tea picker can pluck in an hour of intense work.

    苏联新式机器层出不穷
    三项繁重劳动实现机械化
    运肥机械化　又快又便宜
    在排干了水的沼泽里，一架带旋转犁转筒的拖拉机一面松着泥炭土层，一面缓缓前进。后面跟着另一架拖拉机，这架拖拉机面前装着集土器。集土器用土斗将松散的泥炭集成堆。接着吊挂装土机迅速的将泥炭装入另一架拖拉机的拖车。于是第三架拖拉机便将泥炭送往地里。
    这一整套机器和工具都是苏联白俄罗斯农业机械化电气化研究所设计的。它们能使运肥上地这项繁重的农事全部机械化。用它们来掘取和运送泥炭，花费十分便宜，每吨泥炭运价只两卢布多点。
    这套机器对集体农庄和国营农场特别有价值，因为它们能做农业中装运肥料这项繁重工作。这套机器设计的时候，设计师们采用了一系列改进措施。吊挂在履带式拖拉机上的装肥机能够转动，并有液压操纵装置，每次能扬举七百五十公斤肥料。装肥机用专门的肥斗一小时能装五十吨泥炭或化学肥料。如果将肥斗换上粪叉，这种机器又能往拖车上装粪。将拖车拖到地里以后，拖拉机手不要走出驾驶室，只要将操纵把手转动一下，车斗就翻过来了。这套自卸拖车是为各种马力的拖拉机设计的，拖车的装运量从四百公斤到六吨大小不等。它们全有液压操纵装置。
    机器摘蓖麻　工效高百倍
    不久以前，苏联第聂伯罗彼德罗夫斯克、赫尔松和其他邻州许多机务人员来参观“克里沃罗”国营农场。是什么吸引他们到这里来的呢？
    原来农场小队长奥夫贤尼可夫成功的使农业中最费工夫的一项工作机械化了，那就是在医学、技术和化工方面具有重大价值的农作物蓖麻子的收获工作。
    这里每年要用一百至一百五十个人搞上一个半月到两个月时间去专作采摘刺手的蓖麻子荚的工作。篮子一满，就得小心的把它从地里提出来。几十台拖拉机、汽车和大车等着装车的时间比运蓖麻子的时间多得多。每一公顷的收获工价非常昂贵。尽管如此，有时还要损失掉收成的四分之一。
    而现在所有的蓖麻地都收尽了……只用一个人干了二十天。合理化建议者为此改装了一台“CK—3”型谷物联合收割机。为它服务的只有两辆汽车。因此每公顷收获工价降低了三十四倍。损失几乎没有了，因为收获一直进行到蓖麻株植完全成熟为止。
    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州各国营农场已将必要数量的谷物联合收割机改装好了，用来收摘所有种植场的蓖麻子。这为国家节约了一百万卢布以上。同时以后可以将这项有价值的技术作物的种植面积扩大好几倍。
    新式摘茶机　自动选嫩茶
    在南方灼人的阳光下，成百的妇女附身在绿色的灌丛上。从灌丛后面望去，只能看见她们的背和遮阳的宽边草帽。这是在摘茶了。
    摘茶不是一桩容易的事情。摘茶工一天约能摘四万片嫩叶，平均共合二十至三十公斤茶叶。摘一公顷茶需要四百个工。
    怎样减轻摘茶工的劳动呢？索钦斯基试验站（苏联高加索北部）的科学工作者久已在考虑这个问题。不久以前，他们创造性的探索终于成功了。他们设计并制造了一种“чу—1，ВЩ”新型摘茶机。
    这种摘茶机的摘茶装置好像一把跨在茶丛上的弧形梳，它能区别老叶和嫩叶，只摘可摘的嫩叶，而不损伤不能摘的嫩芽。
    摘茶装置装在自行机架上。它的平均生产能力是每小时摘四十公斤茶叶。这比最优秀的摘茶工紧张工作一小时所摘的茶大约多九倍。
