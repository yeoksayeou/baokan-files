Comrade Ren Yongbin of the Power Department of the 55-cubic-meter blast furnace workshop at the Xingtai Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei Province, felt it was a great waste to see 70% of the gas from the blast furnace escape unused. He thought, "If this gas could be recovered and used to burn boilers and roast ore, how great would that be!" So, he made up his mind to experiment. Lacking technical knowledge about gas recovery, he actively sought advice from others and finally succeeded in the experiment.

Recovering blast furnace gas to burn boilers and roast ore can save more than two tons of good coal per boiler per day; the number of workers burning boilers has been reduced from three to one per shift.

    回收高炉煤气焙烧矿石
    河北邢台炼铁厂五十五立方米高炉车间动力部任永彬同志，看到高炉里的煤气，70％都白白跑掉了，觉得十分可惜。他想：“如果将这些煤气回收，用来烧锅炉、焙烧矿石够多好！”于是，他下定决心搞试验。不懂煤气回收的技术知识，就主动向别人请教，终于试验成功了。
    回收高炉放出的煤气烧锅炉、焙烧矿石，每天每个锅炉可以节省两吨多好煤；烧锅炉的工人每班由三人减到一人。
