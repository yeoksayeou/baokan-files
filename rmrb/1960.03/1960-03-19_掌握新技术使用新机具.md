    Mastering New Technologies and Using New Machinery
    Tiāngōng
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, skilled workers in all industries on the industrial front have created a large number of new machines and new tools, presenting a new situation of "ten thousand strands of spring breeze and willow branches" everywhere.

    Two months ago, the transportation, factory, and enterprise internal handling and loading/unloading departments in Tianjin, where manual operation still accounted for 90%, in a short period of time jumped to a mechanization and semi-mechanization level of over 80%. The work methods of carrying on shoulders, pulling by people, and moving by hand, which had been used for thousands of years, have been replaced by new types of machinery. The next problem to be solved is how to cultivate technical workers at high speed, so that more people can master the use and maintenance of these machines in the shortest possible time.

    This requires that in the current technical revolution movement, technical workers be cultivated and trained at high speed. Its significance is threefold: First, it can enable the vast number of workers to master a large number of machines in the fastest possible time and put them into production, increase productivity, and achieve the goal of manufacturing new machines; second, only after workers master new machines can they be widely used and promoted, technically transform the original equipment, and gradually improve in the process of promotion and application, making them more perfect. Third, after workers master new machines, they can more effectively consolidate the results of the movement, inspire the enthusiasm of employees to make innovations, and thus push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new high.

    The purpose of our technical innovation and technical revolution is to improve production efficiency and liberate heavy physical labor, and the new machinery and new tools created by the masses in the movement are sharp weapons that hit this purpose. Having a purpose and having weapons does not mean that everything is ready, but there must be a large number of people who can master, use, maintain, and repair these weapons to ensure that the "arrow" of technical innovation hits the "target" of improving labor productivity accurately.

    There are many methods for training technical personnel, including setting up schools, training courses, and other step-by-step methods, as well as carrying out mass movements to adopt various forms of high-speed training. Because the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is progressing at high speed, a large number of mechanized and semi-mechanized new machines are created in a few dozen or even a few days. In order to prevent these new machines from being idle, the work of training technical personnel must keep up accordingly. The methods adopted by the transportation and factory enterprise internal handling and loading/unloading departments in Tianjin, such as combining amateur training and centralized full-time training, combining practical operation and classroom teaching, learning while doing, learning and then doing, learning again if they don’t know, master teaching apprentices, apprentices teaching apprentices, and studying in other factories at the same time, are good ways to carry out mass movements to train technical personnel at high speed.

    Some people say that the cultural level of porters is low and they cannot quickly master complex machines. This view is very one-sided. They have not seen that porters, due to their urgent desire to be liberated from heavy physical labor, and as the masters of the machines, have a higher enthusiasm for learning technology than intellectuals. Therefore, as long as they are mobilized and organized, they can quickly master technology. The fact is that in a very short period of time, more than 10,000 porters and loaders in Tianjin have skillfully mastered new machines, more than 3,000 have become multi-skilled workers who can use a variety of machines, and 740 have become "native experts" in machine design and manufacturing, which is not a good proof?

    掌握新技术使用新机具
    天工
    在以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，工业战线上各行各业的能工巧匠都创造了大批的新机器、新工具，到处呈现出“春风杨柳万千条”的新局面。
    两个月前，手工操作程度还占90％的天津市交通运输和工厂、企业内部的搬运、装卸部门，在短短的时间内就使机械化、半机械化的程度一跃而至80％以上。千百年来肩扛、人拉、手搬的工作方式，都被新型的机械所代替了。紧接着要解决的就是如何高速度地培养技术工人，让更多的人在最短时间内掌握使用和维修这些机器了。
    这就要求在当前的技术革命运动中，要高速地培养、训练技术工人，它的意义有三：第一，它可以使广大工人在尽快的时间内把大批机具掌握起来，投入到生产中去，提高生产率，达到制造新机具的目的；第二，只有工人掌握新机具后，才有可能使新机具广泛地应用、推广，对原有设备进行技术改造，并在推广和应用中逐步提高，使其更加完善。第三，工人掌握新机具后，才能更有效地巩固运动成果，鼓舞职工群众的闹革新的积极性，从而把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高潮。
    我们闹技术革新和技术革命的目的，是为了提高生产效率和解放繁重的体力劳动，而广大群众在运动中创制出来的新机械、新工具，就是命中这个目的的犀利的武器。有了目的，也有了武器，并不等于万事俱备，而必须有大批的人能够掌握、运用、维护、修理这种武器，才能保证使技术革新之“矢”，不偏不倚地射中提高劳动生产率之“的”。
    培训技术人才也有很多的方法，有开办学校、训练班等按部就班的方法，也有开展群众运动采取多种形式高速培训的办法，因为技术革新和技术革命运动是高速度地进展的，在几十天甚至几天之内就创制出大批的机械化和半机械化的新机具，为了不让这些新机具闲置起来，培训技术人才的工作就必须相应的跟上。天津市交通运输和工厂企业内部的搬运、装卸部门所采取的业余培训和集中脱产培训相结合，实际操作和课堂讲授相结合，边干边学，学学就干，不会再学，师傅带徒弟，徒弟带徒弟和外厂留学同时并用等从实际出发的办法，就是开展群众运动高速度培训技术人才的好办法。
    有人说，搬运工人的文化水平低，不能很快地掌握复杂的机器。这种看法是十分片面的。他们没有看到搬运工人由于迫切地要求从繁重的体力操作中解放出来，作为机器的主人，他们学习技术的积极性比知识分子还高，因此只要把他们发动起来，组织起来，便可以很快地掌握技术。事实也正是这样，天津市的搬运和装卸工人在很短的时间内就有一万多人熟练地掌握了新机具，三千多人成为能使用多种机具的多面手，七百四十人成了机具设计制造的“土专家”不就是很好的证明吗？
