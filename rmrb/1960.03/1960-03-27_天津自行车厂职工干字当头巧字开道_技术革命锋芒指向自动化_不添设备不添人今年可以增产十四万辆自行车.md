Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 26th: The workers of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, carrying forward the spirit of "poor sticks" (a reference to self-reliance and hard work in the face of adversity), daring to think and daring to act, thinking higher and higher, and doing bigger and bigger, are directing the cutting edge of the technological revolution towards automation, bringing about tremendous changes in the factory's production and working conditions. To date, they have already completed an automated production workshop, eighteen automated production lines, and thirty-eight linked and automatic single machines, and have transformed one hundred and twenty manual operation procedures into mechanized and semi-mechanized processes. Now, the factory's degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has increased from 65.7% to 76.6%, and the degree of automation and semi-automation has reached 16%. This year, without adding personnel or equipment, the factory can increase its production of "Flying Pigeon" bicycles by 140,000.

To pave the way for automation, the factory first started with ideological work, letting thought lead the way. The Party Committee first widely publicized the significance of automation and the favorable conditions for realizing automation to the workers. At the same time, it organized cadres and engineering and technical personnel to repeatedly study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and launched a discussion on "How to Achieve High-Speed Production" based on the factory's situation. Factory leaders went deep into the workshops and held separate forums with cadres, technical personnel, and veteran workers to listen to the opinions and demands of the masses. The vast majority of people expressed their approval, and some workers composed rhymes saying: "Think cleverly, study diligently, work hard to make improvements; surpass Zhuge Liang, rival Lu Ban, unwilling to rest without creating miracles." They said, "As long as we have great determination, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome." This spirit of the workers, putting "diligence" first and "ingenuity" as the guide, with great ambition to climb to the peak, educated the few people with conservative ideas.

Where to start with automation? The factory Party Committee decided to adopt the method of breaking through key points to drive overall progress, focusing first on the electroplating workshop, fighting a great battle for twenty days to realize the first automatic production line. The workers warmly responded to the call of the Party Committee. The workers in the repair workshop, who were responsible for manufacturing the automatic electroplating machine, proposed: "If the Shanghai Bicycle Factory can make automatic electroplating machines, so can we; if Shanghai takes two months, we will strive to complete it in ten days." Other workshops also expressed that they would provide manpower and materials to fully support it. The sheet metal workers adopted the method of preparing in advance, finding materials while cutting materials, and completed 60% of the material cutting workload in three days. The metalworking group adopted the method of "machines running non-stop, people taking turns to rest," seizing every minute to ensure that materials arrived and work was completed. Technical personnel and workers studied together on-site, and drew up a rough sketch in two hours. The Party Branch Secretary of the workshop, the workshop director, and more than one hundred workers participating in the assault also moved their luggage to the workshop, "sleeping by the machine, eating beside the machine." As a result of their hard work and ingenuity, they completed the first automatic electroplating machine in just nine days, allowing the electroplating workers to leap to the skies, completely changing from heavy manual operation to automation.

After the first automatic production line was realized, the factory Party Committee immediately convened an on-site meeting, proposing technical innovation slogans such as large-scale automated production lines, material-saving and high-efficiency continuous processes, fitters not using files, and riveting not using hammers. After visiting the automatic electroplating machine, the workshops expressed their determination one after another, formulated specific plans and measures, and a situation of everyone working together and innovating everywhere immediately appeared in the factory. The painting and assembly workshop realized the assembly line production of pedals and handlebars in two days; the chain workshop of Accessories Factory No. 1 succeeded in creating an automatic production line that connected four processes, including indentation and oil boiling, in four days.

Now, the enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory is growing stronger. They are determined to realize two automatic production workshops, twenty-two automatic production lines, and thirty-five automatic single machines before the "May Day" holiday, so that 80% of the workers use mechanical operation.

    天津自行车厂职工干字当头巧字开道
    技术革命锋芒指向自动化
    不添设备不添人今年可以增产十四万辆自行车
    据新华社天津26日电　天津自行车厂职工发扬“穷棒子”精神，敢想敢干，越想越高，越干越大，把技术革命的锋芒指向自动化，使全厂生产面貌和劳动条件发生了巨大变化。到目前为止，他们已经搞成了一个自动化生产车间，十八条自动生产线，三十八台联动和自动单机，并且使一百二十道手工操作工序变成了机械化、半机械化。现在，全厂机械化、半机械化程度已由65．7％提高到76．6％，自动化、半自动化程度达到16％。这个厂今年不添人、不添设备，就可以增产十四万辆“飞鸽牌”自行车。
    这个厂为了给自动化开路，首先从思想工作入手，思想先行。党委首先向职工广泛宣传自动化的意义和实现自动化的有利条件，同时组织干部和工程技术人员反复学习党的八届八中全会文件，针对本厂情况展开了“如何实现生产高速度”的讨论。工厂领导干部深入车间，又分别召开干部、技术人员和老工人座谈会，听取群众的意见和要求。绝大部分人表示赞成，有的工人编了顺口溜说：“巧思量，苦钻研，为搞改进加油干；超诸葛，赛鲁班，不创奇迹心不甘。”他们说：“只要决心大，天大困难也能克服。”工人们这种“干”字当头、“巧”字开道的立大志攀登高峰的劲头，使少数有保守思想的人受到了教育。
    自动化从何着手？工厂党委决定采取突破重点带动全面的办法，先以电镀车间为重点，大战二十天，实现第一条生产自动线。职工们热烈响应了党委的号召。承制自动电镀机的修理车间工人提出：
  “上海自行车厂能做自动电镀机，我们也能做；上海用两个月，我们争取十天完成。”其它车间也表示要人有人，要料给料，全力支援。版金工采取提前准备、边找料边下料的办法，三天就完成了下料工作量的60％。金工组采取歇人不歇车的办法，分秒必争地保证料到活成。技术人员同工人在现场一起研究，两个小时就画出了草图。车间党支部书记、车间主任和一百多名参加突击的工人，也纷纷把行李搬到车间，“守机餐、伴机眠”。他们苦干巧干的结果，只用九天时间就制成了第一台自动电镀机，使电镀工人一步登天，由笨重的手工操作完全改为自动化。
    第一条自动生产线实现以后，工厂党委立即召开现场会议，提出大搞自动生产线、压材高效能连续化、钳工不用锉刀、铆合不用鎯头等技术革新号召。各车间参观了自动电镀机以后，纷纷表示决心，订出具体规划和措施，全厂立即出现了人人齐动手、处处搞革新的局面。油漆装配车间两天就实现了脚踏、车把装配生产流水线；附件一厂链条车间四天搞成功了一条把砸窝、煮油等四道工序连在一起的自动生产线。
    现在，全厂职工劲头越干越足。他们决心要在“五一”节前实现两个自动生产车间和二十二条自动生产线、三十五台自动单机，使80％的职工使用机械操作。
