    The Chinese Exhibition Hall covers an area of 3,600 square meters. Premier Grotewohl and other distinguished guests spent an hour in the Chinese Pavilion. The "Red Flag" limousine displayed at the entrance of the Chinese Pavilion aroused great interest among the visitors. Inside the exhibition hall, the distinguished guests watched the performance of eighteen machine tools manufactured in China last year, as well as models of the Beijing Great Hall of the People, railway station, National Cultural Palace, Agricultural Exhibition Hall, and other buildings completed last year. The construction speed of these buildings was unanimously praised by the distinguished guests. In front of the special handicraft exhibits, the distinguished guests had a cordial conversation with three Chinese embroiderers who were demonstrating Suzhou embroidery.
