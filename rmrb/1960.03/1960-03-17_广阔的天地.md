    The Vast Expanse
    Wu Lü
    A bank whose employees not only sit behind counters but also live among the masses; not only deal with ledgers and abacuses but also delve into production; they issue loans, not just handing the money out and considering their job done, but also helping the units using the funds to formulate capital utilization plans and improve financial systems, ensuring that every loan plays its greatest role; they develop savings business, not only by simplifying procedures, improving service attitudes, and facilitating depositors' access, but also by summarizing and promoting the masses' experiences in diligence and thrift, and helping the masses increase income and reduce expenditure. Such banks are not just in one or a few places now, but everywhere. The Luoqisi Savings Office in Chongqing, the Jiqing Street Savings Office in Wuhan, the Wangchuanchang Savings Office in Tianjin, and the Ping Mountain County Bank in Hebei are among those that started earlier and have done better.

    Doing bank work in this way gives people a new understanding of it. The impression of bank work in the past was mainly credit and savings, confined to a circle of "money." Now it seems that although it is still credit and savings, the scope is so vast. In various tasks such as developing industry, developing agriculture, helping poor teams catch up with rich teams, and organizing the people's economic life, banks can contribute through their business activities. In these activities, the political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints of bank work have more profound and concrete content. This is a creative development.

    Although the division of labor in the various sectors of the national economy differs, the purpose is to better promote the development of the national economy through this division of labor. The bank is also a sector of the national economy. Its main task is to support the development of production through credit and savings business. Doing this well promotes the development of the national economy. If there is only division of labor, and each guards its own corner, with commerce only managing buying and selling, the bank only managing deposits and withdrawals, production not concerned with transportation, and transportation not asking about production, cutting apart the overall national economy, it will hinder the development of the national economy.

    Our era is an era of great development of the national economy. Such an era has opened up infinitely vast expanses in front of all sectors of the national economy. No matter how different these sectors are in division of labor, they can all play a greater positive role in the great development of the entire national economy through their own business activities. In the banking sector, many places have already set an example, and those who follow are flocking to it. This is a great thing.

    "The sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly." May comrades in all walks of life and all departments come to this vast world and show their talents!

    广阔的天地
    吴滤
    一个银行，他们的职工不只是坐在柜台里边，而且生活到群众中去；不只是同账簿、算盘打交道，而且深入到生产中去；他们发放贷款，不是把钱发出去就算了事，而且帮助用钱的单位制订资金使用计划、健全财务制度，使每一笔贷款都能发挥最大的作用；他们发展储蓄业务，也不只是从简化手续、改进服务态度、便利储户存取着手，而且总结和推广群众勤俭持家的经验，帮助群众开源节流。这样的银行，现在不是一处、几处，而是各处都在这样做。重庆的锣旗寺储蓄所、武汉的吉庆街储蓄所、天津的王串场储蓄所、河北的平山县银行，都是其中做得比较早、也做得比较好的。
    这样去做银行工作，使人对银行工作有了新的认识。银行工作，在过去的印象中，主要是信贷、储蓄而已，跳不出一个“钱”的圈子。现在看来，尽管还是信贷、储蓄，天地却是这般的广阔。在发展工业、发展农业、穷队赶富队、组织人民经济生活等各项工作中，银行都可以通过自己的业务活动尽一臂之力。在这些活动中，银行工作的政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，都有了更加深刻和更加具体的内容，这是一个创造性的发展。
    国民经济各个部门的分工虽有不同，目的都是为了通过这种分工更好地促进国民经济的发展。银行也是国民经济中的一个部门。它的任务主要就在于通过信贷和储蓄业务，支持发展生产。做好了这一点，就促进了国民经济的发展。如果只有分工，而各守一隅，商业只管买买卖卖，银行只管存款取款，生产不管运输，运输不问生产，把一个整体的国民经济割裂开来，就有碍国民经济的发展。
    我们的时代是国民经济大发展的时代。这样的时代，在国民经济各个部门的面前，都开辟了无限广阔的天地。不管这些部门分工有多少不同，它们都可以通过自己的业务活动，对整个国民经济的大发展发挥更大的积极作用。在银行这个部门，已经在很多地方做出榜样来，后来者也是蜂拥而至，这是一件大好事。
    “海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”，愿各行各业各个部门的同志，都到这个广阔的天地来大显身手！
