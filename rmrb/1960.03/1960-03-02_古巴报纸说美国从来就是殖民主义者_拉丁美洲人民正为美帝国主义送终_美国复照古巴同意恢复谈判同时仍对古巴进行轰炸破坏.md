Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 1st. The Cuban newspaper "Combate" commented on the US reply to Cuba on March 1st, pointing out that the US reply protects the interests of some large American plantation owners, such as the United Fruit Company. "Combate" said that the land of large American plantation owners and the land of large Cuban plantation owners were equally confiscated according to the Land Reform Law. The newspaper also pointed out that the US government is trying to confuse the interests of the American people with the interests of the US government.

On the same day, "Combate" also used a full page to expose the entire history of US interference in Latin American countries.

The newspaper pointed out that from 1902 to 1954, American imperialism carried out thirty-two acts of intervention in Cuba, Colombia, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala, Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia and other Latin American countries. All dictatorships are the product of American intervention.

"Combate" pointed out that when President Eisenhower began his trip to South America, he said that accusations of American colonialism in Latin America were slander, but in fact, the United States has always been a colonialist. The newspaper emphasized that today's awakened people are sending American imperialism to its grave.

"Revolución" also published an article criticizing the United States for maintaining its threat to Cuba's sugar quota in its reply.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st. Washington dispatch: The US State Department replied to the Cuban government on February 29th, expressing its agreement to resume diplomatic negotiations between the two countries on outstanding issues, but the US note also openly stated that the United States would reserve the freedom to take any means to interfere in Cuba. The note arrogantly stated: "The United States government, in exercising its own sovereignty, must always be free to take any steps it deems necessary to defend the legitimate rights and interests of the American people."

In a note delivered to the United States on February 22nd, the Cuban government stated that the Cuban government had decided to appoint a committee to resume diplomatic negotiations with the United States to resolve the issues between the two countries. The necessary condition for this negotiation was that the US government or Congress should not take any unilateral measures that might harm the outcome of the talks or harm the Cuban economy and the Cuban people.

The US reply not only unreasonably rejected this legitimate request from the Cuban government, but also slandered Cuba's measures to safeguard national interests and implement land reform, saying that "the legitimate rights and interests" of Americans in Cuba have been "adversely affected due to the unilateral actions taken by the Cuban government."

US news agencies reported that the State Department's rejection of Cuba's conditions was against the background that the US ruling group was still preparing to coerce Cuba into submission by reducing Cuba's sugar import quota.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 29th. Today, another twin-engine aircraft from the United States invaded Cuba and dropped incendiary bombs on sugarcane fields in Abreus, Rodas, and Palmira in Las Villas province. The plane fled in the direction of the United States after being chased by Cuban aircraft.

At the same time, counter-revolutionaries burned 180,000 arrobas of sugarcane (one arroba equals 11.338 kilograms) at the Manuelita sugar mill and 160,000 arrobas of sugarcane in other areas on the ground. Workers and farmers immediately began harvesting the sugarcane affected by the burning in order to transport it to the sugar mill for immediate crushing.

    古巴报纸说美国从来就是殖民主义者
    拉丁美洲人民正为美帝国主义送终
    美国复照古巴同意恢复谈判同时仍对古巴进行轰炸破坏
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　古巴“战斗报”1日在评论美国给古巴的复照时指出，美国的复照中庇护了像联合果品公司这样一些美国大庄园主的利益。“战斗报”说，美国大庄园主的土地和古巴大庄园主的土地同样是根据土地改革法被没收的。这家报纸还指出，美国政府企图把美国人民和美国政府的利益混淆起来。
    同一天的“战斗报”还以整版的篇幅揭露了美国对拉丁美洲国家进行干涉的全部历史。
    这家报纸指出，从1902年到1954年，美帝国主义对古巴、哥伦比亚、巴拿马、多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、墨西哥、海地、危地马拉、秘鲁、委内瑞拉、巴拉圭、玻利维亚和其他拉丁美洲国家进行了三十二次干涉。所有的独裁政权都是美国干涉的产物。
    “战斗报”指出，艾森豪威尔总统在开始他的南美之行时，曾说关于美国在拉丁美洲实行殖民主义的指责是诬蔑，但是在事实上，美国从来就是殖民主义者。这家报纸强调说，今天觉醒了的人民正为美帝国主义送终。
    “街道报”也发表文章抨击美国在它的复照中保持着它对古巴食糖限额的威胁。
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院2月29日复照古巴政府，表示同意就两国间悬而未决的问题恢复两国外交谈判，但是美国照会同时却公开表明美国要保留采取任何方式来干涉古巴的自由，照会蛮横地表示：“美国政府在行使它自己的主权方面必须始终可以自由采取它认为有必要采取的任何步骤，以保卫美国人民的合法权利和利益”。
    古巴政府在上月22日交给美国的一份照会中曾经表示，古巴政府已经决定任命一个委员会来恢复同美国的外交谈判以解决两国间的问题，这一谈判必需的条件是美国政府或国会不得采取可能损害会谈结果或损害古巴经济和古巴人民的任何单方面措施。
    美国的这个复照不但无理拒绝了古巴政府的这一正当的要求，同时还针对着古巴维护民族利益和实行土地改革的措施诬蔑说，“由于古巴政府采取单方面行动”，使得在古巴的美国人的“合法的权利和利益受到了不利的影响”。
    美国通讯社在报道美国复照的消息中并不讳言，国务院拒绝接受古巴的条件的背景是：美国统治集团仍在准备以削减古巴糖的进口定额来胁迫古巴屈服。
    新华社哈瓦那2月29日电　今天又有一架来自美国的双引擎飞机侵入古巴，向拉斯维利亚斯省的阿夫雷乌斯、罗达斯和帕耳米拉镇的甘蔗田投掷了燃烧弹。这架飞机在古巴飞机的追击下向美国的方向逃去。
    同时，反革命分子在地面上焚烧了马努埃利塔糖厂的十八万阿罗瓦甘蔗（一阿罗瓦等于十一点三三八公斤）和其他地区的十六万阿罗瓦甘蔗。工人和农民立即开始收割受到焚烧影响的甘蔗，以便把这些甘蔗运到糖厂，立即进行压榨。
