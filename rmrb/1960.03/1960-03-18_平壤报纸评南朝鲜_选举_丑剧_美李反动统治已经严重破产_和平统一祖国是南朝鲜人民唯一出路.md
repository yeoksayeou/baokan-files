Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 17th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today stating that the South Korean "Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections" on March 15th were conducted by the Syngman Rhee group using the most barbaric and bloody methods and unprecedentedly despicable and shameless public deception. The US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee group created a terrifying atmosphere of murder with police, military, and secret agents throughout South Korea, which shows that their rule has reached a point of serious bankruptcy.

The editorial said that this election proves that the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee group are thoroughly isolated not only among the South Korean people but also within the South Korean ruling class. This is the inevitable result of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee group's frenzied colonial plunder and traitorous and reactionary rule in South Korea over the past fifteen years.

The editorial pointed out that the Syngman Rhee group's actions in this "election" further and thoroughly exposed the essence of American-style "freedom" and American-style "democracy." The editorial said that the US imperialists have touted the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, which they single-handedly fostered under the guise of the United Nations, as a "democratic fortress" in Asia. However, even the Associated Press said that this "election" was the "most brutal election." The editorial said that this is a specimen of the so-called "free elections under UN supervision" advocated by US imperialism.

The editorial concluded that the South Korean people have once again truly experienced that there is nothing to expect from the so-called "freedom" touted by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee group. There is only one way out for the South Korean people, which is to force the US aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea, end the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland at an early date.

"Democratic Korea" also published an editorial today stating that the situation created by the "Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections" in South Korea leads to a clear conclusion: the US imperialists' occupation of South Korea cannot be allowed to continue, and the puppet rule must end as soon as possible.

    平壤报纸评南朝鲜“选举”丑剧
    美李反动统治已经严重破产
    和平统一祖国是南朝鲜人民唯一出路
    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，3月15日南朝鲜的“正副总统选举”是李承晚集团用最野蛮的流血的方法和史无前例的卑鄙无耻的公开欺骗的手段来进行的。美帝国主义和李承晚集团在整个南朝鲜用警察、军队、特务造成杀气腾腾恐怖气氛，这说明了他们的统治已经到了严重破产的地步。
    社论说，这次选举证明，美帝国主义和李承晚集团不仅在南朝鲜人民中而且在南朝鲜统治阶层中也被彻底地孤立了。这是美帝国主义和李承晚集团在过去十五年间在南朝鲜疯狂进行殖民地掠夺和卖国反动统治的必然结果。
    社论指出，李承晚集团在这次“选举”中的行为进一步彻底地暴露了美国式“自由”和美国式“民主”的本质。社论说，美帝国主义把它在联合国的幌子下一手扶植起来的李承晚伪政权说成是亚洲的“民主堡垒”，可是，就连美联社也说这次“选举”是“最残暴的选举”。社论说，这就是美帝国主义所主张的所谓“在联合国监督下的自由选举”的标本。
    社论最后说，南朝鲜人民又一次切实地体验到美帝国主义和李承晚集团叫嚷的所谓“自由”是没有什么可期待的。南朝鲜人民的出路只有一条，就是使美国侵略军从南朝鲜撤走，结束李承晚的法西斯统治，早日和平统一祖国。
    “民主朝鲜报”也在今天发表社论说，这次在南朝鲜进行的“正副总统选举”造成的局势，得出了一个明显的结论，那就是：再不能让美帝国主义对南朝鲜的霸占持续下去，傀儡统治必须早日结束。（附图片）
