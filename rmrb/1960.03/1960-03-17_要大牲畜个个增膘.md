To make every head of livestock gain weight

The busy season of spring plowing is about to arrive. Feeding all the draught animals well, so that they are all fat and strong, and putting them into spring plowing in a timely manner, is an extremely important and urgent task in current agricultural production.

In our country's spring plowing production, almost every farm job, whether plowing, transporting fertilizer, or lifting water, requires strong animal power. At present, we have very few tractors in our country, and strong large livestock are our "tractors." With them, we can further implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and increase agricultural output even more. For example, using manpower to deep-plow the land, a strong laborer can only plow one or two fen of land in a day; while two strong cattle or mules can plow six or seven mu of land in a day. One person carrying fertilizer can only carry a hundred or so jin; while an ox pulling a large cart can transport two thousand to four thousand jin of fertilizer. Under the current conditions where we cannot achieve full mechanization, using more animal power and various natural forces (wind power, water power, air power, etc.) to replace and reduce heavy human labor, to improve labor efficiency, and promote increased agricultural production is the most realistic path at present. The masses often say, "If a cow gains 10% more fat, the field will yield 10% more produce, and people will save 10% of their strength," which vividly illustrates the causal relationship between protecting draught animals and increasing production and reducing physical labor.

All localities should immediately launch a campaign to increase the weight of large livestock. Increasing weight and protecting livestock is a very important aspect of animal husbandry production. Grasping this link can drive a series of tasks such as feeding management, breeding improvement, epidemic prevention and hygiene, preparing feed, and building livestock sheds. In 1959, the people's communes in various localities grasped the work of protecting livestock over the winter earlier and more thoroughly than in previous years, and the livestock gained much more weight than in the past. In pastoral areas such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Gansu, the proportion of livestock with medium or above weight accounted for more than 90%. In Hebei Province, livestock with medium or above weight accounted for 95%. Many places have changed the historical pattern of general weight loss of livestock in winter and spring, and a new situation has emerged with good weight gain, many pregnant animals, many young animals, and fewer weak animals. All localities should take advantage of this excellent situation and continue to strengthen the work of increasing weight and protecting livestock in the spring. Doing a good job in feeding management is a prerequisite for ensuring that cattle are fat and horses are strong. It is necessary to conscientiously summarize, study, and promote the advanced experience in feeding livestock, and continuously improve the level of feeding management, so that the feeding management of livestock gradually develops towards scientification. Whether livestock are raised well or not depends on feeding management, and whether or not feeding management methods can be quickly improved depends on the feeding management personnel. Therefore, local grassroots party organizations should select party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists who have good ideas and are enthusiastic about the cause of collective feeding to go to the livestock front. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of the feeders, and continuously improve their political and ideological awareness. Shuangmiao People's Commune in Shanghe County, Shandong Province, is a good example of how, after selecting excellent feeders last winter, the commune restored the health of relatively weak livestock in less than a month.

Conscientiously arranging forage and feed is the material basis for raising livestock well. The masses often say, "Grass is fat, and feed is strength," which shows that forage and feed are indispensable. All localities should calculate the amount of feed and forage needed this year based on the number of livestock developed, and make proper arrangements in the agricultural production plan. Corn is the king of feed, and multi-headed sorghum has a high yield, and the stalks can also be used as forage, so the planting area should be expanded in a planned way. Northern alfalfa has a high yield, good nutrition, and can also increase soil fertility, so it can also be promoted in a planned way.

Pay attention to having labor and rest when using livestock. It should be used appropriately according to the extent of the livestock's ability, and special attention should be paid to protecting pregnant and weak livestock. It is necessary to make the vast number of commune members clearly recognize that large livestock are an indispensable force in production, and that it is not easy to raise a head of livestock well, and that the love of large livestock should be raised to the height of love of public property and socialist consciousness for education. In order to protect draught animals, people's communes in various localities should also establish a set of reasonable feeding management and use systems, and conduct regular evaluations and inspections. In this regard, various localities have many experiences, which should be well summarized and promoted.

Protecting draught animals is a very meticulous task. If care is not taken for a while, livestock may get sick; if overused in a season, they may become weak and die. Spring is the season when epidemics are prevalent, so it is necessary to strengthen epidemic prevention, do a good job in preventive injections and environmental sanitation, and prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases.

Spring plowing is the decisive battle in the annual agricultural production. The sowing area of spring-sown crops accounts for more than half of the annual sowing area. The amount of cultivation is large, and the time is very concentrated, urgently requiring strong cattle and horses to be put into battle in a timely manner. In the recent general inspection of preparations for spring plowing in various localities, the use and protection of large livestock should be given special attention. We must do everything possible to do a good job in feeding management, and in the shortest possible time, make every head of livestock fat and strong, so as to better complete the tasks of spring plowing and annual agricultural production.

### 要大牲畜个个增膘

    要大牲畜个个增膘
    春耕大忙季节就要到来。把所有的耕畜饲养好，使它们头头膘肥体壮，及时投入春耕，这是当前农业生产中一项极为重要而迫切的工作。
    我国的春耕生产中各项农活无论耕种、运肥、提水等，几乎没有一项不需要强壮的畜力。目前我国拖拉机还很少，健壮的大牲畜就是我们的“拖拉机”。有了它，我们就可以进一步贯彻农业“八字宪法”，更多地提高农业产量。例如，用人力来深翻地，一个壮劳力一天只能翻一、两分地；而两头强壮的牛或骡子一天可以翻六、七亩地。一个人挑运肥料，不过挑百来斤；而一头牛拉大车可运肥料二千斤到四千斤。在目前我们还不可能实现全部机械化的条件下，多用畜力及各种自然力（风力、水力、气力等）来代替和减轻人的繁重劳动，来提高劳动效率，促进农业增产，这是当前最现实的道路。群众常说：“牛增一成膘，田增一成产，人省一分力”，这就十分生动地说明了保护耕畜对于增加生产和减轻体力劳动的因果关系。
    各地应该立即开展一个大牲畜的增膘运动。增膘保畜是畜牧生产中一个十分主要的环节。抓住这个环节就可以把饲养管理、繁殖改良、防疫卫生、准备饲料、修建畜舍等一系列工作带动起来。1959年各地人民公社保畜越冬工作比往年抓得早，抓得深入，畜膘比过去大大提高。内蒙古、新疆、甘肃等牧区的牲畜，畜膘在中等以上的占90％以上。河北省中上等膘的牲畜占95％。不少地方改变了历史上冬春牲畜普遍掉膘的成规，出现了膘情好，孕畜多，仔畜多，瘦弱畜少的新气象。各地应当利用这一大好形势，继续加强春季增膘保畜工作。做好饲养管理是保证牛肥马壮的先决条件。要认真地总结研究和推广饲养牲畜的先进经验，不断提高饲养管理水平，使牲畜的饲养管理逐步向科学化发展。牲畜养的好坏，决定于饲养管理，而能不能迅速改进饲养管理方法，又决定于饲养管理人员。因此，各地基层党组织要抽调那些思想好、热心集体饲养事业的党、团员和积极分子到牲畜战线上去。同时还要加强对饲养人员的政治思想教育，不断地提高他们的政治思想觉悟。山东省商河县双庙人民公社去年冬天选派优秀的饲养员以后，不到一个月的时间使全社比较瘦弱的牲畜恢复了健壮，就是一个很好的例证。
    认真安排饲草饲料，是养好牲畜的物质基础。群众常说：“草是膘、料是力”，这说明草料缺一不可。各地应根据牲畜发展头数计算出今年饲料饲草的需要量，在农业生产计划中妥善安排。玉米是饲料之王，多穗高粱产量高，秸秆也可作饲草，都应有计划地扩大播种面积。北方紫苜蓿产量高，营养好，还可增加地力，也可有计划地推广。
    使用牲口要注意有劳有逸。应当根据牲口力所能及的程度，使用得当，尤其要注意保护孕畜和瘦弱的牲畜。要使广大社员都能明确认识到大牲畜是生产中不可缺少的动力，养好一头牲口很不容易，要把爱护大牲畜提高到爱护公共财产和社会主义觉悟的高度来进行教育。为了保护耕畜，各地人民公社还应建立一套合理的饲养管理和使用制度，定期进行评比检查。这方面各地已有许多经验，要很好地总结和推广。
    保护耕畜是一项十分细致的工作，一时照料不周，牲畜就可能生病；一个季节役使过重，就可能瘦弱死亡。春季正是疫病流行季节，要加强防疫，做好预防注射和环境卫生等工作，防止传染病发生。
    春耕是全年农业生产中决定性的战役。春播作物播种面积占全年播种面积一半以上。耕作量大，时间又很集中，迫切需要牛强马壮，及时投入战斗。各地最近在备耕工作大检查中，应把大牲畜的使用和保护情况，着重检查一下。要想尽一切办法做好饲养管理工作，在最短时间内，使大牲畜头头膘肥体壮，以便更好地完成春耕和全年农业生产的任务。
