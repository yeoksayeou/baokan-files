Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 26th: A rally in support of the Haitian people's struggle was held here last night on the sixth day of the Week of Solidarity with the Latin American People. Several Haitian exiles who spoke at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the Haitian people support the Cuban Revolution. The Haitian people regard the success or failure of the Cuban Revolution as their own. Washington's pawn—the Duvalier tyranny in Haiti—is the enemy of the Cuban and Haitian people.

The distinguished Haitian poet and patriot, René Depestre, pointed out in his speech that Haiti, the first country in Latin America to achieve independence, fell into the clutches of American imperialism after shaking off the shackles of France. American imperialism carried out a military occupation of Haiti in 1915 and ruled there for twenty years.

Algeria Laya, leader of the National Women's Federation of Venezuela and representative of Venezuela, emphasized that defending the Cuban Revolution means defending the national interests of Latin American countries. Amid cheers at the meeting, she said that volunteers in Venezuela to defend Cuba have begun to sign up, farmers are raising funds to donate a cannon to the Cuban people, workers are raising funds to donate an airplane, and women are raising funds for a field hospital and ambulance equipment for Cuba. She emphasized that if the United States invades Cuba, Venezuela will never supply the invaders with a drop of oil. Not only are volunteers from Latin America going to Cuba to participate in the fighting, but new fronts will be opened on every mountain on the Latin American continent.

Delia Echavarria, vice-chairwoman of the Cuban Women's Congress for Latin American Liberation, and Gerardo Figueras of the "July 26th Movement" said in their speeches that the Cuban people support the struggle of the Haitian people for national liberation and democracy.

The congress concluded with a performance of Haitian folk songs. Representatives from various Latin American countries and leaders of Cuban people's organizations were present on the podium.

    哈瓦那集会支持海地人民斗争
    据新华社哈瓦那26日电　这里昨晚在支援拉丁美洲人民周第六天举行了支持海地人民斗争的大会。在会上发言的一些海地流亡者一致指出，海地人民支持古巴革命。海地人民把古巴革命的成败看作是自己的成败。华盛顿的走卒——海地的杜瓦利埃暴政是古巴人民和海地人民的敌人。
    海地杰出的诗人和爱国者雷纳·德佩斯特在会上发言时指出，拉丁美洲第一个取得独立的国家的海地在摆脱了法国的束缚以后，落入了美帝国主义的魔爪中，美帝国主义在1915年对海地实行军事占领，并且在那里统治了二十年。
    委内瑞拉全国妇女联合会领导人、委内瑞拉代表阿尔赫利亚·拉亚强调说，保卫古巴革命就是保卫拉丁美洲国家的民族利益。在会议的欢呼声中，她说，在委内瑞拉保卫古巴的志愿者已开始报名，农民在募集基金，以便捐献一门大炮给古巴人民，工人在为捐献一架飞机募捐，妇女在为古巴募集野战医院和救护设备的基金。她强调说，如果美国侵略古巴，委内瑞拉绝不供给侵略者一滴石油。不仅拉丁美洲有参加战斗的志愿者前往古巴，而且在拉丁美洲大陆的每一个山上都将开辟新的战线。
    古巴妇女争取拉丁美洲解放大会副主席德利亚·埃切瓦里亚和“7月26日运动”的赫拉尔多·菲格雷斯在会上发言时表示，古巴人民支持争取民族解放和争取民主的海地人民的斗争。
    大会最后表演了海地的民间歌曲。在主席台上有拉丁美洲各国的代表，古巴各人民组织的领导人。
