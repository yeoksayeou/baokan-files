With the rising sun and bright spring scenery, tens of thousands of commune members are fighting on the drought resistance front on the vast Hebei Plain. Red flags are fluttering during the day, and lanterns and torches at night. The sound of waterwheels turning, the sound of locomobiles, and people's slogans merge together. This is the prelude to the first bumper harvest of the 1960s.

Look: "Swear to seize the wheat greening pass," "Guarantee wheat harvest even with a hundred days of no rain," "Eliminate drought before spring sowing," "Resist drought until the heavens bow their heads," "Never give up until complete victory." These slogans are decisive and unambiguous! They are the bold words of the people's commune members! It is the determination that man will conquer nature!

We have always strategically despised the enemy. In order to ensure the wheat harvest and ensure sowing, the drought demon is the "enemy." We despise it and will surely be able to defeat it.

At the same time, tactically we attach great importance to the "enemy." According to the Hebei Province Meteorological Forecast, during the spring plowing season this year, there will be more spring wind, higher temperatures, and less rainfall than usual, and the drought situation will continue, and may even develop further. Therefore, if this situation is underestimated and we become complacent, irreparable losses will be caused. People see this very clearly. The work of the Communist Party Committee of the Waliwang People's Commune in Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, in the current drought resistance struggle is relatively good. This commune has thoroughly and meticulously studied the "enemy" and our side, and formulated a practical combat plan. The central content is "seven increases": that is, increase leadership, increase labor, increase livestock, increase water sources, increase tools, increase time, and increase daily progress. With a big "enemy" at hand, "seven increases" means concentrating superior forces to contain the "enemy."

There is only one wheat harvest and one spring sowing a year. These are two extremely important battles. If these two battles are fought well, it will lay the foundation for a bumper harvest throughout the year. Of course, this is not "finishing the job in one battle." Following spring sowing and wheat harvest, there will be summer sowing and autumn harvest. To win a bumper harvest throughout the year, we must also fight other battles, large and small.

Strategically despising the "enemy" and tactically paying attention to the "enemy," the "seven increases" specifically embodies this idea. "Of all the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first," it is not unreasonable for the Waliwang People's Commune to put "increasing leadership" in the first place. In addition to the First Secretary personally taking charge, the commune party committee also appointed two secretaries, two standing committee members, and thirty-one cadres to form a drought resistance headquarters. Leaders at all levels took the lead, contracting at each level, all the way down to the plots of land, producing and commanding at the same time, and solving problems in a timely manner when they were discovered. This is the fundamental guarantee for winning the battle.

The way to "increase" is self-reliance. What to do about the shortage of labor and livestock, the lack of tools, and the lack of water sources? Be afraid of difficulties? No. Reach out to superiors? No. Their method is to make full use of existing conditions, rely on their own efforts, tap potential, create new conditions, and overcome numerous difficulties. The Waliwang Commune's method of increasing labor is to widely carry out full attendance campaigns and engage in five combinations. The five combinations are: topdressing and cultivating, preparing for cultivation, diversified operations, orchard management, and logistics work, all combined with watering and drought resistance. In this way, the center is highlighted and the general is taken care of, making the labor force from "tight" to "abundant," which is a win-win situation. For example, their method of increasing tools is to mobilize the masses and organize skilled craftsmen to clean, repair, match, assemble, modify, manufacture, and create through seven character measures, transforming the tools originally lying in warehouses and scattered parts and other "dead" objects into "living" objects that can be applied; to modify the tools that were originally inconvenient to use and inefficient, turning them into handy and efficient tools; at the same time, everyone used their brains and vigorously engaged in inventions and creations, so that the tools changed from "lack" to "enough". As the saying goes: "If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." With many "sharp tools," why worry about not being able to "do a good job"! In the face of this "increase," the most ferocious drought demon has to obediently "retreat three houses."

The fundamental purpose of "increasing" is to ensure the wheat harvest and ensure sowing. The scope of "increasing" is not only a management area, a production team, nor a few districts and teams, but the whole commune should universally "increase". While the Waliwang Commune implemented the seven "increases", it fully exploited the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune, and implemented mutual adjustment of leadership, labor, livestock, water sources, tools and technical forces between districts and teams, concentrated forces to attack weak links, and ensured that the whole commune had no "three types of teams" and "dead corners".

The launch of the "increase" embodies the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. The three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are displaying their great power, illuminating the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, making people more intelligent and wise, and more incomparably powerful, invincible. People use these three magic weapons to cut through thorns and thorns, and strive with full confidence to achieve the first bumper harvest in the 1960s.

    丰收的前奏
    陈实
    旭日东升，春光明媚，在广大的河北平原上，成千上万的公社社员，奋战在抗旱前线。白天红旗招展，夜晚灯笼火把，水车转动声、锅驼机声和人们的口号声汇合在一起，这是六十年代头一个丰收的前奏曲。
    看：“誓夺小麦返青关”、“百日无雨保麦收”，“把干旱消灭在春播前”，“抗旱抗到天低头”，“不获全胜不罢休”。这些标语口号，斩钉截铁，毫不含糊！它是人民公社社员们的豪言壮语！是人定胜天的决心！
    我们在战略上从来就是藐视敌人的。为了保麦收，保播种，旱魔就是“敌人”。我们藐视它，也一定能够战胜它。
    与此同时，在战术上我们又十分重视“敌人”。据河北省气象预报，今年春耕期间，春风多，气温高，雨量较常年少，旱情还将继续下去，甚至还可能有发展。因此，如果对这种情况估计不足，麻痹大意，就会造成不可弥补的损失。这一点，人们看得很清楚。河北省交河县洼里王人民公社党委，在当前抗旱斗争中的工作是作得比较好的。这个公社深入细致地研究了“敌”方和己方，制定了切实的战斗方案。其中心内容是“七增”：即增领导、增劳力、增牲畜、增水源、增工具、增时间、增日进。大“敌”临头，“七增”意味着集中优势力量，箝制“敌人”。
    一年只有一次麦收、一次春播。这是两次极为重要的战役。两仗打好了，就给全年的丰收奠定了基础。诚然，这不是“毕其功于一役”，跟着春播、麦收而来的，还有夏播和秋收。要赢得全年大丰收，还必须打好其他的大大小小的战役。
    战略上藐视“敌人”，战术上重视“敌人”，“七增”具体体现了这一思想。“千条万条，党的领导第一条”，洼里王人民公社把“增领导”放在第一位，不无道理。这个公社党委除了第一书记亲自挂帅外，又确定两名书记、两名常委、三十一名干部，组成抗旱指挥部，各级领导上马，层层包干，一直包到地块，边生产，边指挥，发现问题，及时解决。这是取得战斗胜利的根本保证。
      “增”的途径是自力更生。劳、畜力紧张，工具缺乏，水源不足等等，怎么办？畏难么？不。向上级伸手要么？不。他们的办法是充分利用现有条件，自力更生，挖掘潜力，创造新的条件，克服重重难关。洼里王公社增劳力的方法是：广泛开展出全勤运动，大搞五结合。五结合就是：追肥中耕、备耕、多种经营、果树管理、后勤工作等项，统统结合浇水抗旱。这样，既突出了中心，又照顾了一般，使劳力由“紧张”到“宽裕”，两全其美。又如，他们增工具的方法是：发动群众和组织勤工巧匠，通过清、修、配、装、改、制、创七个字的措施，把原来躺在仓库里的工具，和零星机件等“死”物，加以安装配套，变成了可以应用的“活”物；把原来用着不灵便、效率不高的工具加以改制，变成了应手效高的好工具；同时，人人开动脑筋，大搞发明创造，这样，就使工具由“缺乏”到“足够”了。俗语说：工欲善其事，必先利其器。有了众多的“利器”，何愁不能“善其事”呢！在这“增”字面前，再凶恶的旱魔也只得乖乖地“退避三舍”啦。
      “增”的根本目的，是要确保麦收，保播种。“增”的范围不仅是一个管理区，一个生产队，也不是几个区和队，而是全社要普遍的“增”。洼里王公社在七“增”的同时，充分发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，实行了区与区、队与队之间的领导、劳力、畜力、水源、工具和技术力量的互相调剂，集中力量猛攻薄弱环节，保证了全社无“三类队”和“死角田”。
    “增”字上马，体现了光辉的毛泽东思想。总路线、大跃进、人民公社三件法宝，正大显神通，它照澈了亿万人民的心，使得人们更加聪明智慧，更加力量无比，无往而不胜。人们以这三件法宝，披荆斩棘，信心百倍地力争六十年代头一个丰收的实现。
