There is Much to Learn
Cheng Pu

How to arrange crop planting in production practice? There is much to learn here. For example, which crops are most economically viable to plant in a certain area during a certain period? In what season is it best to plant a certain crop locally? Is it better to plant early or late? How can one crop be coordinated with other crops to increase production together? These questions require us to use our brains and conduct serious research.

Guang'an County is a famous high-yield corn area in Sichuan Province. Last year, under particularly droughty conditions, the average yield of 130,000 mu of corn in the county reached 733 jin per mu, more than double that of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. This year, instead of deciding to plant corn in general, Guang'an County seriously summarized last year's experience and decided to plant more early corn; not only plant more early corn, but also plant it early. This is what they call "seeking earliness within earliness." The benefits of doing so are: first, it can extend the corn growing period; second, it can avoid certain natural disasters (both of which can promote greater corn production); third, it can plant an additional season; and fourth, it can resolve the contradiction between corn production and summer harvesting, rice transplanting, and other farm work. Furthermore, when expanding early corn production, Guang'an County not only pays attention to ensuring that early corn itself yields more, but also pays attention to not squeezing the area of other crops due to the expansion of early corn, and to not hindering the production of crops in the same or subsequent seasons. It can be believed that the result of doing so will not only be higher yields of early corn, but also increased production of other crops. Guang'an County has studied so much knowledge around the issue of planting corn.

In fact, not only corn is like this, but other crops are also like this. The production of each crop contains a wealth of knowledge that requires people to constantly explore and master. In the production of a crop, there are general rules that generally apply to many regions (for example, corn can achieve high yields in many regions); there are also special rules that only apply to individual regions (for example, in Guang'an County, Sichuan, planting early corn can achieve higher yields). To creatively lead production, it is certainly indispensable to understand the general laws of a certain production, and especially indispensable to understand the special laws of this crop production, because these special laws are generated from the specific natural and socio-economic conditions of the time and place. Many things in agricultural production often seem simple, but are actually complex. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with common-sense understanding of various things in production, and we must not stop at superficial understanding, but must delve into the interior of these things to observe and discover aspects and corners that have not yet been recognized by us. The more comprehensively we can understand the various laws in production, the more ways we can find to increase production. The knowledge in agricultural production is endless, and practice and hard study can help us continuously enrich our knowledge about production, so as to rely on it to create more wealth.

    大有学问
    程浦
    在生产实践中怎样安排作物的种植？这里边是大有学问的。例如，在一个地区、一定时期多种哪几种作物在经济上最合算？一种作物在本地最好在什么季节种植？早种好还是晚种好？一种作物和其他作物怎样配合才能共同增产？这些问题都需要我们开动脑筋认真研究。
    广安县是四川省著名的玉米高产地区，去年，在特别干旱的情况下，全县十三万亩玉米平均亩产量达到了七百三十三斤，比大跃进的1958年猛增一倍以上。今年广安县不是笼统地决定多种玉米，而是认真地总结了去年的经验，决定多种早玉米；不但多种早玉米，而且早种早玉米。这就是他们所说的“早中求早”。这样做的好处是：一可以延长玉米生长期，二可以避开某些自然灾害（以上两条都可以促使玉米更多地增产），三可以多种一季，四可以解决玉米生产与夏收、插秧等农活的矛盾。不但如此，广安县在扩大早玉米生产的时候，不只是注意保证早玉米本身更多地增产，而且注意到不因为扩种早玉米而挤掉其他作物的面积，注意到不妨碍同茬作物和下茬作物的生产。可以相信，这样做的结果，将不仅仅是早玉米更高产，而且其他各种作物也会增产。广安县围绕着一个种植玉米问题就钻研出这么多的学问。
    其实，不仅玉米是这样，其他作物也是这样。每一种作物的生产中都蕴藏有丰富的学问，需要人们不断地去探讨，去掌握。一种作物的生产中，有一般的规律，它大体上适用于许多地区（例如玉米在许多地区都能高产）；也有特殊的规律，它只适用于个别的地区（例如在四川的广安县，种早玉米能够更多地获得高产）。要做到创造性地领导生产，固然不可不了解某种生产的一般规律，尤其不可不了解这种作物生产的特殊规律，因为这种特殊规律是从当时当地的具体的自然条件和社会经济条件中产生的。农业生产中有许多事物常常貌似简单，实际上却是复杂的。因此，我们对于生产中的各种事物，不能只是满足于常识性的了解，不能浅尝辄止，而要深入到这些事物的内部去观察、去发现尚未被我们认识到的方面和角落。我们越是能更全面地认识生产当中的各种规律，就越能找到更多的增产门径。农业生产中的学问是无穷无尽的，实践和刻苦钻研可以帮助我们不断地丰富关于生产的学问，以便依靠它去创造更多的财富。
