　　Dengfeng's 300,000 People Mobilize Together

　　(Our report) Henan's Dengfeng County has launched a sanitation campaign throughout the county to learn from Jishan and catch up with Jishan. The characteristics of this movement are that the secretary personally takes command, Party members and activists take the lead, and 300,000 people mobilize together. Cai Zhenzhong, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, held four consecutive broadcast and telephone conferences to deploy the elimination of the four pests (rats, bedbugs, mosquitoes, flies) and the promotion of hygiene, eliminating many remaining pests in the county. During the movement, the health and medical network was consolidated and expanded, health record bags were universally established, and all six communes in the county implemented collective medical care. The county also worked to improve the living conditions of the masses, not only changing the sanitary conditions, but also accumulating more than 6 million tons of fertilizer.

　　Currently, the Dengfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has further adopted five measures: seize the favorable opportunity to launch another annihilation battle to eliminate the remaining four pests; take the hospital as the center to expand prevention, control infectious diseases, and eliminate other diseases; conduct key construction, universal improvement, and comprehensive clean-up of housing; popularize public health knowledge education, and thoroughly change sanitary conditions and people's mental outlook.

    登封三十万人民齐动手
    本报讯　河南登封县在全县范围内掀起了学稷山、赶稷山的卫生运动。这次运动的特点是书记亲自挂帅，党团员积极分子当先锋，三十万人民齐动手。县委第一书记蔡振忠连续四次召开广播会、电话会布置开展除四害（老鼠、臭虫、蚊子、苍蝇）、讲卫生运动，全县歼灭了不少残余的四害。在运动中，巩固扩大了卫生医疗网，普遍建立了健康档案袋，全县六个公社全部实行了集体医疗制度。全县还进行改善群众的居住条件，不但改变了卫生面貌，而且积了六百多万吨肥料。
    目前，中共登封县委进一步采取五项措施：抓住有利时机，再来一次消灭残余四害的歼灭战；以医院为中心，扩大预防，控制传染病，消灭其他疾病；对住房进行重点新建、普遍改良、全面清理的工作；普及全民卫生知识教育，彻底改变卫生面貌和人们的精神面貌。
