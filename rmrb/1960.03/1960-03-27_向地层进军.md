A Party Secretary's Notes

    Marching Towards the Strata
    Ren Yunfeng, First Secretary of the CPC Bin County Committee, Shaanxi Province

    It has been a full 130 days without a single drop of rain. Across the vast sky, not a single cloud can be seen. However, in this loess plateau region of western Shaanxi, you cannot see even a trace of drought. What you see are lush, sturdy wheat seedlings as if they've been washed with water, a flow of people fighting the drought, countless well frames standing like pagodas in the fields, and a network of crisscrossing canals. The heroic commune members, in the face of four consecutive months without a drop of rain, did not cower or lose heart. They stood tall, scorned the drought, and forced the fierce drought demon to submit. In just one month, all 1,090,000 mu of wheat in the county were irrigated once. Fight the drought until the heavens bow their heads, fight the drought until a bumper harvest comes, even if it doesn't rain for three years, the granaries will be piled to the clouds. This is the ambition of the entire county to subdue the drought demon.

    The drought has educated people to believe even more in their own strength, tempered their will to conquer nature, and brought into play their endless wisdom. Based on the experience of fully utilizing existing wells on the drought-stricken plains to fight the drought, the county Party committee decisively decided to launch an emergency mobilization to march towards the strata and demand grain from the underground water. In a half-month sprint, dig 10,000 wells, realize the water conservancy of the plateau, and forever break free from the threat of drought.

    The bugle call to march towards the strata has sounded! Tens of thousands of people are heading to the fields in a mighty force. It is truly, "Yesterday we subdued the drought demon, today we come to battle the earth." The people of the entire county, united closely around the Party, have established the lofty ambition that man will conquer nature. Thirty thousand heroes, wielding silver hoes, declared war on the strata. Across the 3,300 square kilometers of land in the county, 10,000 well openings were created overnight, and 10,000 well-digging frames stood in the vast fields. The slopes and plains were filled with people digging wells. There were workers, peasants, students, and office cadres. White-haired elders walked out of the homes for the elderly, Young Pioneers rushed out of the classrooms. Regardless of gender or age, regardless of the cardinal directions, regardless of occupation, everyone felt honored to contribute to well-digging. The rivers and mountains shook, the earth trembled. What great power the revolutionary mass movement led by the Party possesses! During the day, red flags fluttered, and songs shook the earth; at night, ten thousand lanterns and torches illuminated half the sky. People forgot the day, forgot the night, and only remembered one thing: dig a well, seize ten thousand dan of grain. One well after another was dug, and one well after another was used to irrigate the land. The county Party committee's task of 10,000 wells was exceeded in less than three days, reaching 16,000 wells. Triumphant letters, phone calls, and telegrams constantly flew to the county Party committee.

    "Xinmin Commune reports!" The excited voice of the commune Party committee's first secretary came from the telephone earpiece: "The entire commune has dug 1,985 wells in three days, and we guarantee to complete the task of digging 4,000 wells on time." "Our commune has dug 3,233 wells." Now reporting is the first secretary of the Beiji Commune Party Committee. Such phone calls can be received at any time. All the triumphant letters and phone calls were filled with joy and excitement. The 30,000 well-digging heroes dug 15,531 wells, expanding the irrigated area by 27,125 mu, equivalent to 20% of the water conservancy projects done since last winter, and all of this only took half a month!

    The drums of the Great Leap Forward awakened the strata that had been sleeping for thousands of years, making the water hidden deep in the strata serve the will of the people. The wells here are generally 45 meters deep, and the deepest reach 120 meters, and they must penetrate three to five layers of rock.

    What is there to fear from the depth of the wells! If the wells are a hundred zhang deep, the revolutionary drive is ten thousand zhang high. No matter how difficult the problem is, it cannot withstand the word "do." No matter how deep the well is, we will not give up until we strike water. The heroic people of the Dimiao management district of Beiji Commune fought for 20 days and brought water up from 100 meters underground. The speed of well-digging was almost unbelievable, and the record of advancing one zhang per day was commonplace. The red flag competition movement on the construction site was in full swing. "If you dig one zhang, I will dig one zhang and five chi!" Xu Naiwen and Shi Dongshi of Liujiabao in Beiji Commune launched a head-to-head competition. The two fought for a day and dug more than one zhang and four chi. Li Fahai, a 50-year-old commune member from Changwu Commune, and his daughter-in-law Meng Zhi'e, dug a well 30 meters deep in six days. Stories of mother-child wells, father-son wells, husband-wife wells, and brother wells can be heard everywhere.

    Zhao Zhenfang, the branch secretary of the Xinmin production team of Xinmin Commune, who is known as the "Red Secretary," worked in the well for three days. The Party committee secretary and commune members repeatedly advised him to rest, but he politely refused. Shang Peixi, the Party branch secretary of the Dingjia production team of Changwu Commune, did not return home for twelve days. His footprints and sweat were left on the surface and in the wells of all 135 wells in the team. The Zhitian Commune had a shock team composed of six Communist Party members, specializing in tackling tough battles. In fifteen days, they drilled through more than 40 rock layers inside the wells. Our heroes used such perseverance to awaken the sleeping strata and change the face of the mountains and rivers.

    People's subjective initiative contains endless power. The masses led by the Party are an ocean of wisdom. The 30,000 heroes are 30,000 skilled craftsmen. People are vigorously engaged in tool reform and striving to improve work efficiency. Using a winch to lift the soil was too slow, so they changed it to a pulley; the speed of the pulley was still considered too low, so they changed it to a large wheel. Well-digging has achieved semi-mechanization, and work efficiency has increased by two times. The air in the well is thin, and lighting is difficult at night, so Gao Sanlai and Gao Balai, two elderly commune members in their sixties, created a mirror reflection lamp that can reflect light to 50 meters deep in the well. Difficulties are being defeated one by one in front of the heroes.

    People not only see the present but also look forward and think more and further. The well groups in all ten communes in the county are uniformly planned according to the terrain: one li apart for rows, and ten zhang apart for wells, which is convenient for both mechanized farming and afforestation. Looking down from a height, the earth is like a chessboard, with layers of combs and orderly arrangements. People vow to use their giant wrists to put a verdant new outfit on the Loess Plateau.

    向地层进军
    中共陕西邠县县委第一书记　任云峰
    整整一百三十天了，没下过一滴雨，万里长空，看不到一丝云彩。但是，在我们这个陕西西陲的黄土高原地区，你却看不到一星半点干旱的痕迹，你所看到的是像水洗过似的嫩绿茁壮的麦苗，是抗旱的人流，像宝塔一样矗立在原野上的无数座井架，蛛网般纵横交错的渠道。……英雄的人民公社社员，在连续四个月不下一滴雨的情况下，没有畏缩气馁，他们昂首挺胸，蔑视干旱，迫使凶恶的旱魔低头就范。仅仅在一个月时间内，全县一百零九万亩小麦就全部浇灌了一次。抗旱抗到天低头，抗旱抗到大丰收，哪怕三年不下雨，粮囤插到云里头。这就是全县人民降伏旱魔的雄心壮志。
    干旱教育了人们更加相信了自己的力量，锻炼了人们征服大自然的意志，发挥了人们无穷无尽的智慧。根据旱原广泛发挥原有水井作用大闹抗旱的经验，县委果断地决定：紧急动员，向地层进军，向地下水要粮。突击半月，打井万眼，实现高原水利化，永远摆脱干旱威胁。
    向地层进军的号角吹响了！成千上万的人民浩浩荡荡地奔赴原野。这真是“昨日才把旱魔伏，今日又来战地球”。全县人民，紧紧地团结在党的周围，树立了人定胜天的雄心壮志。三万雄师，挥舞银锄，向地层宣战。全县三千三百平方公里的土地上，一夜之间开了一万个井口，一万个打井架子，矗立在辽阔的原野上。漫坡遍野，布满了打井的人群，这里有工人、农民、学生、机关干部。白发苍苍的老人走出敬老院，红领巾们奔出了课堂，人不分男女老少，地不分东南西北，职业不分工农商学兵，人人都以能为打井出份力为光荣。河山震动了，大地颤抖了。党领导的革命群众运动，具有多么大的威力啊！白天，红旗招展，歌声撼天动地；晚上，万只灯笼火把，映红了半壁天。人们忘了白天，忘了夜晚，只记得一件事：打得一眼井，夺得万石粮。一眼眼井打成了，一眼眼井浇地了。县委提出的一万眼井的任务，不到三天就超额完成了一万六千眼。报捷的书信、电话和电报，不断地飞向县委会。
    “新民公社报告！”电话耳机里传来公社党委第一书记兴奋的声音：“全社三天打井一千九百八十五眼，打四千眼井的任务，保证按时完成。”“我社已打井三千二百三十三眼。”现在报告的是北极公社党委第一书记。这样的电话，随时都可以接到。所有报捷的书信和电话，都充满了胜利的喜悦和激动。三万打井雄师，打井一万五千五百三十一眼，扩大灌溉面积二万七千一百二十五亩，相当于去冬以来所做水利工程的20％，而这一切，仅仅花了半月时间！
    大跃进的战鼓，唤醒了千年沉睡的地层，使蕴藏在地层深处的水为人的意志服务。这里的井，一般深达四十五米，最深的达到一百二十米，而且要打穿三层到五层的岩石。
    井深怕什么！井深百丈，革命干劲高万丈，天大的困难顶不住一个“干”字。任你井深千尺，不打出水不罢休。英雄的北极公社底庙管区人民，大战二十天，把水从一百米深的地下引了上来。打井速度之快，几乎令人难以置信，日进一丈的纪录司空见惯。工地上的红旗竞赛运动，搞得热火朝天。“你打一丈，我就打丈五”！北极公社六甲堡的许乃文和史东时展开对口赛，两人大战一天，掘进一丈四尺还多。长武公社五十多岁的老社员李发海和他的儿媳孟芝娥两人，六天打了一口井，深达三十米。母子井、父子井、夫妻井、兄弟井的佳话，到处都可听到。
    被人称为“红支书”的新民公社新民生产队支部书记赵振芳，在井下干了三天，党委书记和社员几次劝他休息，都被他婉言谢绝。长武公社丁家生产队党支部书记尚培西，十二天没回过家，全队一百三十五眼井的井上井下，都印下了他的足迹，洒下了他的汗珠。职田公社有六名共产党员组成突击组，专打攻坚战，在十五天内，打穿了四十多个井内的岩石层。我们的英雄，就是用这样的毅力，唤醒了沉睡的地层，改变了山河的容颜。
    人的主观能动性蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量。党领导的群众是智慧的海洋。三万名雄师就是三万名能工巧匠。人们大搞工具改革，努力提高工效。辘轳提土太慢，改成滑车；滑车的速度还嫌低，又改成大轮。打井实现了半机械化，工效提高了两倍。井下空气稀薄，晚上照明困难，六十多岁的老社员高三来、高八来兄弟俩创造了明镜反射灯，可以把光反射到五十米深的井下。困难，在英雄们面前，一个一个被击溃了。
    人们不仅看到现在，而且高瞻远瞩，想的更多，看的更远。全县十个公社的井群，都按地形情况统一规划：行距一里，井距十丈，既便机耕，又便绿化。登高鸟瞰，大地就像棋盘一样，层次栉比，秩序井然。人们发誓要用自己的巨腕，给黄土高原披上翠绿的新装。
