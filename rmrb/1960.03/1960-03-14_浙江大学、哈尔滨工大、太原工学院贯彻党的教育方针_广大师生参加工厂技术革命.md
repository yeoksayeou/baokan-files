Zhejiang University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Taiyuan Institute of Technology Implement the Party's Education Policy
Faculty and Students Participate in Factory Technical Revolution
Promoting Current Production and Improving the Quality of Teaching and Scientific Research

    (Our report) Hangzhou—More than 3,000 faculty members and students at Zhejiang University have recently launched a surge of factory-school collaboration, vigorously promoting mechanization, semi-mechanization, and semi-automation.

    Currently, more than 300 teachers and more than 3,000 students from over twenty specializations in eight departments, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, radio engineering, chemical engineering, metallurgy, civil engineering, mathematics, mechanics, and physics, have gone to industrial and mining enterprises such as Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Factory, Hangzhou Automobile Factory, Xiaoshan Motor Factory, Banshan Iron and Steel Plant, Jiaxing Mining Machinery Factory, Ningbo Transformer Factory, and Quzhou Chemical Plant. Combining production labor, production internships, graduation designs, and scientific research, they are working with workers to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution.

    Thanks to the joint efforts of faculty, students, and workers from various factories and mines, thousands of technical innovation projects have been completed in a very short period. Many of these are significant technical innovations that play a positive role in realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations and the semi-automation of modern enterprises. Since arriving at the factories in January, faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering, in cooperation with workers, have completed more than 800 technical innovation projects, including over 100 major technical innovations. Fourth-year students majoring in industrial enterprises, together with workers from the Second Engineering Division of Zhejiang Installation Company, created an electric drilling machine, increasing work efficiency by thirty times and changing drilling operations from manual to mechanized.

    The participation of faculty and students in the current nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement not only strongly supports industrial production, but more importantly, allows teachers' theoretical knowledge to be further linked with production practice, enriching their practical knowledge and helping to improve teaching work. Students can test and consolidate their professional knowledge in production practice, gain practical experience, and improve the quality of learning and independent work ability. For example, fifth-year students majoring in mechanical engineering who participated in technical innovation at Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory and Hangzhou Steam Turbine Factory were assigned the design tasks of modular machine tools and 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine manufacturing processes. Through independently studying literature, collecting data, analyzing problems, drafting plans, conducting technical discussions and research with factory workers, and measuring and drawing, their working abilities have been fully exercised and improved, thus ensuring the quality of design and improving academic performance. Many students have learned a lot of knowledge and operational experience that cannot be learned from books by contacting the actual production, which greatly broadened their knowledge fields.

    In the current vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, faculty and students who went to factories saw the leap-forward development situation on the industrial front and the workers' high enthusiasm for building socialism and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. They received great education and encouragement, and more deeply realized that the working masses have infinite wisdom and power, and that intellectuals can only play their due role when they combine with the workers and peasants. Therefore, many faculty members and students reflected that they will work harder to transform their thinking in the future, achieve the laborization of intellectuals as soon as possible, and train themselves into red and expert intellectuals of the working class.

    Through the participation of faculty and students in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the relationship between factories and schools has also been strengthened, creating favorable conditions for further implementing the Party's education policy and establishing a base combining teaching, production labor, and scientific research. Many factories have stated that they will maintain regular contact with Zhejiang University in the future and support the school with materials. Faculty and students at Zhejiang University also said that they must take turns going to factories to support the factories with more technical strength. Many students and workers have become close friends, and they are determined to cooperate better in the future and strive to continuously promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 13th—Harbin Institute of Technology, in combination with teaching and scientific research, assists factories and enterprises in Harbin City in vigorously promoting mechanization and automation. Since November last year, they have organized more than 1,000 faculty members and students from various departments to go deep into more than 100 units, including factories, enterprises, basic construction departments, and service industries in the city, to closely cooperate with the workers, jointly design, and have already developed 35 automated production lines, of which 16 have been built and put into production. At the same time, more than 120 single-machine automation projects have been realized. Harbin Jinxing Machinery Factory was originally a small factory merged from a handicraft cooperative and district street factories. With the assistance of faculty and students majoring in foundry at Harbin Institute of Technology, it quickly realized the complete mechanization and partial automation of foundry production, increasing production efficiency by 12 times, improving the qualified rate of castings from 40% to 95%, and fundamentally improving working conditions.

    Harbin Institute of Technology uses various forms to cooperate with factories and enterprises in mechanization and automation.

    One form is to list the technical problems in the process of vigorously promoting mechanization and automation as scientific research projects, overcome scientific and technological difficulties together with the factory, and help the factory adopt new processes and technologies. The school's mechanical manufacturing technology major and industrial enterprise electrification major, in cooperation with Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory, designed and manufactured an automated production line for pipe threader blades. During the design process, the factory and school jointly conducted scientific research on processing technology, typical structure, electrical automatic control, electromagnetic components, and other projects, and studied the use of broaching as a new process in the slot processing of the blades, replacing the previous milling, which shortened the processing time of this process from five minutes to fifteen seconds.

    The second form is to participate in the appraisal of some automated production lines under the unified leadership of the municipal party committee. They conducted in-depth investigations in dozens of factories, systematically summarized the various experiences and creations of the masses in the movement of vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, and elevated them to theory, writing nearly one million words of scientific papers. This provides favorable conditions for the promotion, application, and development of these experiences.

    The third form is to combine the arrangement of graduation designs for some fifth-year students and the production labor of some classes with assisting factories in solving technical problems in the mechanization and automation movement. For example, nine fifth-year students majoring in pressure processing, in cooperation with Harbin Bearing Factory, successfully designed an automated production line for precision forging. The success of this design allows the bearing ring to be directly ground after forging without machining, reducing the number of workers from 150 to one. The entire design has now been adopted by the factory and has begun to be manufactured.

    In the process of enthusiastically assisting various factories and enterprises in vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, Harbin Institute of Technology also improved its scientific research level. The industrial enterprise electrification major started the research on electrical automation several years earlier than originally planned because of its cooperation with factories in automating production lines. Relevant majors participating in the mechanization and automation movement also compiled four collections of scientific papers, including "Collection of Scientific Research Reports on Automated Production Lines," "Collection of Papers on Industrial Enterprise Electrification and Automation," and "Selected Collection of Scientific Research Reports on Modularization." Relevant majors have also significantly improved the quality of teaching by participating in the mechanization and automation movement in combination with student graduation designs and production labor.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th—In the new situation of the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the current industrial front, Taiyuan Institute of Technology further implements the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. According to the teaching arrangements, it dispatched 639 fourth- and fifth-year students, led by 143 teachers, to 41 factories and mines to serve as vanguards in the technical revolution.

    After this group of teachers and students went to the factories in mid-January, they assisted in vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution under the unified leadership of the party committees of the factories and mines, according to actual needs. In the casting workshops of Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, Jinxi Machine Factory, and Shanxi Machine Factory, manual operations still account for more than 50%. The teachers and students majoring in casting at Taiyuan Institute of Technology took assisting in the mechanization of casting operations as their main task. Various types of belt lathes at Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory account for a large proportion. The teachers and students who went to this factory took the transformation of old belt lathes into semi-automatic lathes as their main task. The teachers and students not only proposed various innovative designs based on the actual conditions of each factory and adapted to local conditions, but also closely cooperated with factory technicians and workers during the design process. Finally, after a comprehensive review by factory technicians and workers, they strived to make the designs practical and feasible. In order to avoid the duplication of research on a single topic by the groups sent to each factory and to avoid unnecessary waste, Taiyuan Institute of Technology also organized mutual cooperation groups inside and outside the school to collect the common problems found in various factories and hand them over to teachers and students at the school for research.

    Going to the factory to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution together with workers not only greatly supported the factories and mines and was welcomed by all parties, but also provided a good exercise for the teachers and students who went to the factory. After a period of common labor, the teachers and students who went to the factory have already become one with the vast number of workers and have become the closest friends in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Whether teachers or students, after this exercise, their ability to solve practical production problems has been improved to a certain extent. In the past, the course design for fourth-year students was done by teachers asking questions in the classroom. Now they are working in real production, closely connecting with reality.

    浙江大学、哈尔滨工大、太原工学院贯彻党的教育方针
    广大师生参加工厂技术革命
    推动了当前生产，提高了教学和科学研究质量
    本报讯　浙江大学师生三千多人最近掀起了厂校结合，大搞机械化、半机械化和半自动化的热潮。
    目前，已有机械、电机、无线电、化工、冶金、土木、数学、力学和物理等八个系二十几个专业的三百多名教师和三千多名学生，分别奔赴杭州制氧机厂、杭州汽车制造厂、肖山电机厂、半山钢铁厂、嘉兴矿冶机械厂、宁波变压器厂、衢州化工厂等工矿企业，结合生产劳动、生产实习、毕业设计和科学研究，和工人一起，大闹技术革新和技术革命。
    由于师生和各地厂矿企业职工的共同努力，千百件技术革新项目在很短的时间内已经完成。其中有很多是重大的技术革新，对实现手工操作机械化半机械化和现代企业的半自动化起了积极的作用。电机系师生，和工人合作，从1月份下厂以来，已完成技术革新项目八百多项，其中重大技术革新项目有一百多项。工企专业四年级学生和浙江安装公司第二工程处工人一道制成了电动打眼机，提高工效三十倍，并使钻孔工作由手工操作改为机械化操作。
    广大师生参加当前全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动，不仅有力地支援了工业生产，更重要的是使教师们的理论知识进一步地和生产实践联系起来，丰富了实际知识，有助于改进教学工作；广大学生在生产实践中检验和巩固了专业知识，得到了实际经验，提高了学习质量和独立工作能力。例如，在杭州机床厂、杭州汽轮机厂参加技术革新的机金专业五年级学生，分别担任了厂中的积木式机床和六千瓩汽轮机制造工艺的设计任务，通过独立地钻研文献、搜集资料、分析问题、拟订方案，和厂内工人进行技术讨论和研究，以及测绘制图等，工作能力得到了全面的锻炼和提高，因而保证了设计质量，提高了学习成绩。不少学生由于接触了生产实际，学到了很多书本上学不到的知识和操作经验，大大地扩大了知识领域。
    在当前以排山倒海之势蓬勃发展的技术革新和技术革命运动中，下厂师生看到工业战线上的飞跃发展形势，看到工人群众建设社会主义的高度热情和敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，受到了很大的教育和鼓舞，更加深刻地体会到工人群众有无穷的智慧和力量，知识分子只有和工农群众结合，才能发挥应有的作用。因此，许多师生反映，今后要更加努力改造思想，尽快做到知识分子劳动化，把自己锻炼成为一个又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。
    通过师生下厂参加技术革新和技术革命运动，还密切了厂校之间的关系，为进一步执行党的教育工作方针，建立教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的基地，创造了良好的条件。许多工厂都表示今后要和浙大保持经常联系，并在物资上支援学校；浙大师生也表示一定要轮流下厂，以更多的技术力量支援工厂。许多学生和工人已经成为亲密的朋友，他们决心今后更好地合作，为不断地推动技术革新和技术革命运动而努力。
    新华社哈尔滨13日电　哈尔滨工业大学结合教学和科学研究，协助哈尔滨市各工厂企业大搞机械化、自动化。从去年11月以来，他们共组织各系师生一千多人，深入市内各工厂企业、基本建设部门和服务性行业等一百多个单位，同工人群众密切协作，共同设计，已经研究成三十五条自动化生产线，其中十六条已建成投入生产，同时实现了一百二十多项单机自动化。哈尔滨金星机械厂原是一个由手工业合作社和区街工厂合并而成的小厂，经哈尔滨工业大学铸工专业师生协助，很快实现铸工生产全盘机械化和部分自动化，使生产效率提高十二倍，铸件合格率由40％提高到95％，劳动条件有了根本改善。
    哈尔滨工业大学利用各种形式，同工厂企业协作搞机械化、自动化。
    一种形式是把大搞机械化、自动化过程中的技术问题列为科学研究项目，同工厂一起攻克科学技术难关，并且帮助工厂采用新工艺、新技术。这个学校的机械制造工艺专业和工业企业电气化专业，同哈尔滨第一工具厂协作，设计制成了管子板牙刀片自动化生产线。在设计过程中，厂校共同进行了加工工艺、典型结构、电气自动控制、电磁元件等项目的科学研究，并在刀片槽加工中研究采用拉削的新工艺，代替过去的铣削，使这道工序加工时间由五分钟缩短到十五秒钟。
    第二种形式是在市委统一领导下，参加部分自动化生产线的鉴定工作。他们深入调查了几十个工厂，系统地总结了群众在大搞机械化、自动化运动中的各种经验和创造，把它们提升到理论，写成了近百万字的科学论文。这就为推广、运用和发展这些经验提供了有利条件。
    第三种形式是，把安排部分五年级学生的毕业设计及某些班级的生产劳动，同协助工厂解决机械化、自动化运动中的技术问题结合起来。如压力加工专业九名五年级学生，同哈尔滨轴承厂合作，设计成功了精密锻造自动化生产线。这一设计成功，可使轴承环锻出后，不经过车加工就直接进行磨加工，使工人由一百五十人减少到一个人。现在全部设计已为工厂采用，并已开始制造。
    在热情协助各工厂企业大搞机械化、自动化的过程中，哈尔滨工业大学同时提高了自己的科学研究水平。工业企业电气化专业因为同工厂协作搞自动化生产线，就比原来计划提前几年开始了电气自动化的研究。参加机械化、自动化运动的有关专业，还编写了“自动化生产线科学研究报告集”、“工业企业电气化及自动化论文集”、“积木式科学研究报告选集”等四本科学论文集。有关专业也因为结合学生毕业设计和生产劳动参加机械化、自动化运动，显著地提高了教学质量。
    据新华社太原13日电　在当前工业战线上技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃发展的新形势下，太原工学院进一步贯彻党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，根据教学安排，派出四、五年级学生六百三十九名，在一百四十三名教师率领下，分别到四十一个厂矿去，充当技术革命的尖兵。
    这批师生在1月中旬下厂以后，在各厂矿党委的统一领导下，根据实际需要，协助大搞技术革新和技术革命。山西机床厂、晋西机器厂、山西机器厂的铸工车间手工操作还占50％以上，太原工学院铸工专业的师生就把协助实现铸工操作机械化作为他们的主要任务。太原机车车辆厂各种型号的皮带车床占的比重很大，下到这个厂的师生们就把改造旧皮带车床为半自动车床作为自己的主要任务。师生们不仅从各厂的实际条件出发，因地制宜地提出各种革新设计，而且在设计过程中，同工厂技术人员和工人密切合作，最后经过工厂技术人员和工人的全面审查，力求作到切实可行。为了避免下到各厂的小组重复研究一个主题，造成不必要的浪费，太原工学院还组织校内外相互配合小组，把在各工厂发现的带有普遍性的问题集中起来，交给在校师生研究。
    到工厂里去同职工一起大搞技术革新和技术革命，不仅大大支援了各厂矿，受到各方面的欢迎；而且对下厂师生也是一次很好的锻炼。下厂师生同广大工人在一起，经过一段时间的共同劳动，现在已经打成一片，成了技术革新和技术革命运动中最亲密的朋友。无论教师、学生，经过这次锻炼，解决生产实际问题的能力都有了一定的提高。过去四年级学生的课程设计是由教师出题在教室里作的，现在在生产中真刀真枪地干，密切地联系了实际。（附图片）
