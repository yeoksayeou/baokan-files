Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, March 10th: The imperialists have not changed their fundamental goal of maintaining capitalism and destroying socialism; the United States is still exacerbating international tensions; all this proves that the struggle to safeguard world peace must not be relaxed.

According to a report in the Sydney "Tribune" weekly, the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, Sharkey, recently reported on the international situation at a meeting of the Party's Central Committee, calling on the Australian people to wage a vigorous struggle against the policies of reviving West German and Japanese militarism.

Sharkey pointed out that although the current international tension has indeed eased somewhat, and this is what people hope for, the imperialists have not changed their fundamental goal of maintaining the capitalist system and destroying the socialist system.

Sharkey said that the current easing of the situation shows that the position of the "Cold War" advocates has weakened, and the forces of peace have further strengthened. Sharkey pointed out that reactionary monopoly capitalists, who are making huge profits from arms contracts, are stubbornly resisting the trend towards peace.

He said that the revival of German militarism, led by Nazi generals, is a serious threat to world peace. The Adenauer government is a government engaged in militarism and war conspiracies, and West Germany's military force is the strongest force in the aggressive troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Sharkey said, "At this very moment, the US government has signed a treaty with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, which means the revival of aggressive Japanese militarism."

Sharkey said that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China oppose the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" because the treaty is aimed at them and threatens all Asian countries.

Sharkey pointed out that Eisenhower's open declaration to resume nuclear tests is another example of the US policy of exacerbating international tension.

Sharkey said that Eisenhower recently also threatened that the United States would intervene in Latin American countries in the event of "Communist subversive activities" against the existing dictatorial systems in Latin American countries and against the brutal exploitation of these countries by US monopoly capital. This is another example of creating tension. Sharkey said that Eisenhower also declared that situations like Cuba would never be allowed to arise in other countries.

Sharkey said, "There is no doubt that the democratic forces fighting for genuine independence and better lives will oppose this threat, and in doing so, they will receive the support of peace and democracy forces around the world."

Sharkey stressed that all this proves that the struggle to safeguard world peace and to ban nuclear weapons and achieve disarmament must not be relaxed.

When talking about the great construction achievements of socialist countries, Sharkey said that in all the decisive aspects of economy, culture and science, the development speed of socialist countries far exceeds that of capitalism, even the speed in its heyday.

He said that China has basically completed its Five-Year Plan in two years, and in a few years, it will become the third largest steel producer in the world. Other socialist countries have also made similar progress.

Sharkey said, I can summarize it in one sentence: the socialist countries are a huge construction site with one-third of the world's population.

Sharkey said that the imperialists' attempt to hinder this development through "Cold War," arms race and trade embargo has been completely defeated.

He said that the imperialists recognize this and are conducting a "painful re-evaluation."

He pointed out that the imperialists have fallen behind, "This is because capitalism itself restricts economic growth and restricts the development of science and culture. As time goes by, this factor will become more and more obvious to people."

He said that this is precisely some of the factors that cause fierce disputes between bourgeois leaders in the United States and elsewhere today.

Sharkey said that this is also a major factor that led President Eisenhower to make peaceful remarks, agree to participate in a summit meeting, and a certain relaxation in international tensions in recent times.

Sharkey finally said, "The imperialists have no intention of disarming, and the people's movements everywhere must force them to disarm."

    澳共总书记谈目前国际形势
    帝国主义并没有改变企图保持资本主义和摧毁社会主义这一根本目的；美国仍然在加剧国际紧张局势；这一切证明维护世界和平的斗争决不能放松。
    新华社10日讯　悉尼消息：据悉尼“论坛”周报报道，澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基最近在党的中央委员会会议上报告国际形势时，号召澳大利亚人民进行强有力的斗争，反对复活西德和日本的军国主义的政策。
    夏基指出，虽然目前国际紧张局势的确有所缓和，而且这是人们所希望的，但是，帝国主义并没有改变企图保持资本主义制度和摧毁社会主义制度这一根本目的。
    夏基说，目前局势有所缓和表明
  “冷战”鼓吹者的阵地削弱了，和平力量进一步加强了。夏基指出，但是靠军火合同捞取巨额利润的反动垄断资本家正在顽固地抗拒走向和平的趋势。
    他说，以纳粹将领们为首的德国军国主义的复活，是对世界和平的严重威胁。阿登纳政府是搞军国主义和战争阴谋的政府，西德的军事力量是北大西洋公约组织的侵略部队中最强大的部队。
    夏基说，“正在这个时候，美国政府同日本的岸信介政府签订了一项条约，这也就意味着侵略性的日本军国主义的复活。”
    夏基说，苏联和中华人民共和国所以反对新的日美“安全条约”，是因为这项条约的矛头是针对它们的，而且威胁着所有亚洲国家。
    夏基指出，艾森豪威尔公开扬言要恢复核试验，这是表明美国的加剧国际紧张局势的政策的另一事例。
    夏基说，艾森豪威尔最近还扬言，美国要在一旦发生反对拉丁美洲国家现有的独裁制度和反对美国垄断资本对这些国家的残酷剥削的“共产党颠复活动”时，就要对拉丁美洲国家进行干涉。这又是制造紧张局势的一个例子。夏基说，艾森豪威尔还扬言，决不允许在其他国家产生和古巴同样的情况。
    夏基说，“毫无疑问，为争取真正独立和改善生活而斗争的民主力量将反对这种威胁，在这样做的时候，他们将得到全世界和平和民主力量的支持。”
    夏基强调说，所有这一切证明，维护世界和平以及禁止核武器和实现裁军的斗争决不能放松。
    夏基在谈到社会主义国家的伟大建设成就时说，在经济、文化和科学等各个决定性的方面，社会主义国家的发展速度远远超过资本主义的速度，甚至是它全盛时代的速度。
    他说，中国已在两年中基本完成它的五年计划，再过几年，它将成为全世界产钢量占第三位的国家。其他社会主义国家也取得了类似的进展。
    夏基说，我可以用一句话来概括说，各社会主义国家就是一个具有全球三分之一人口的庞大的建设工地。
    夏基说，帝国主义者想以“冷战”、军备竞赛和贸易禁运来阻挠这种发展的企图已经遭到惨败。
    他说，帝国主义者认识到这一点了，他们正在进行“忍痛的重新估计”。
    他指出，帝国主义者落在后面了，“这是由于资本主义本身束缚了经济的增长、束缚了科学和文化的发展。随着时间的推移，这个因素将愈来愈明显地为人们所感觉到。”
    他说，这正是使美国和其他地方的资产阶级领袖之间今天发生激烈争端的一些因素。
    夏基说，这也就是使艾森豪威尔总统发表和平言论、同意参加最高级会议以及最近时期国际紧张局势中出现某种缓和的一个主要因素。
    夏基最后说，“帝国主义者毫无裁军的意思，各地的人民运动必须迫使他们裁军。”
