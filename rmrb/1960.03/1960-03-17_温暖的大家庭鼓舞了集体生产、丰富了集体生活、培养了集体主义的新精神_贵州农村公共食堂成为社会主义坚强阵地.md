Warm Big Family Encourages Collective Production, Enriches Collective Life, and Cultivates a New Spirit of Collectivism
Guizhou Rural Public Canteens Become Strong Socialist Bastions
More than 119,000 Canteens are Getting Better and Better; Grassroots Cadres and Party Members All Participate in the Canteens, and Commune Members Eat Well, Eat Good Food, and Eat Clean and Hygienically
Many Canteens Have Become Centers for Commune Members' Meetings, Learning, and Recreational Activities, Attracting Residents to Concentrate Around the Canteens, Creating Conditions for the Construction of New Villages
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Guiyang, March 15) More than 119,000 rural public canteens in Guizhou Province are getting better and better. 94% of the commune member families in the province's rural people's communes have joined the public canteens. Now, the canteens have been consolidated, and those that practice collective cooking, collective meal preparation, and everyone eating in the canteen account for more than 90% of the total number of canteens.

Public canteens are the main position for consolidating the people's commune system and a warm big family for commune members
Rural public canteens have become solid socialist positions in the countryside. The broad masses enthusiastically sing the praises of the canteens, saying, "The people's commune is really good, running the canteen well is reliable, the rice is hot and the dishes are fragrant, and the production enthusiasm is high." Because the canteens are getting better and better, first of all, it is ensured that people eat their fill, eat good food, and eat clean and hygienically, which enables the various ethnic groups of commune members to devote themselves to production without any worries, promoting the continuous upsurge of the production upsurge. Well-run canteens are often places where production teams hold meetings to discuss production, learn, and engage in cultural and recreational activities. Some have become the center of political, economic, and cultural activities of the production team, forming a big family. In these places, the people's communes have been consolidated, and production has also been done very well, fully demonstrating the superiority and importance of the canteens, making the canteens the main position for consolidating the people's commune system. In some places, because the canteens are well-run, everyone has something to rely on, and there is a warm big family, commune members have gathered around the canteens, and there is a trend of residents concentrating, that is, from a number of very small settlements to form a larger settlement, which creates the preconditions for the construction of new villages. Now, throughout the vast rural areas of the province, the idea of taking the canteen as home is being firmly established among the people of all ethnic groups.

Consolidate all canteens and make all canteens run better
The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the work of rural public canteens. In mid-February this year, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting of the first secretaries of the prefectural (autonomous prefectural, municipal) party committees, focusing on the issue of further improving the province's rural public canteens. The meeting pointed out that about 80% of the rural public canteens in Guizhou at that time were consolidated or basically consolidated; a number of well-run canteens had emerged throughout the province. The characteristics of these canteens are: 1. The leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants has been firmly established; grassroots cadres and party members all participate in the canteens, integrate with the masses, share weal and woe, and do everything possible to run the canteens well; all collectively cook and prepare meals, and everyone eats in the canteens. 2. Follow the mass line and implement democratic management; publicize accounts monthly, the masses are familiar with the canteen's assets, and people's hearts are stable. 3. Establish necessary management systems, first of all, the grain ration management system; implement planned grain use and economical grain use, with quotas set according to the number of people and savings returned to oneself. 4. The canteen has its own production and assets. The canteen grows vegetables, raises pigs, and processes non-staple foods; some canteens also have a certain amount of grain reserves, a considerable amount of wild plant starch and dried vegetables; and have simple dining halls, equipped with tables, benches, cooking utensils, and tableware, which are convenient for centralized dining. 5. Great achievements have been made in the reform of cooking utensils, thus reducing the labor intensity of cooking staff and improving the quality of meals. In addition, the meeting also pointed out that about 20% of the canteens in the province were poorly run and not consolidated enough, requiring all localities to quickly consolidate all the canteens that were not consolidated enough; all canteens should learn from the well-run canteens and improve all of them. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, local party organizations at all levels, starting in late February, in conjunction with the preparation for spring plowing, led commune members to launch a large-scale activity to further improve public canteens, especially focusing on rectifying and consolidating the work of canteens that were previously poorly run. In a short period of time, the number of consolidated canteens in the province quickly increased to more than 90% of the total number of canteens.

Secretaries take the lead in running public canteen "experimental plots," and cadres are transferred to go deep into public canteens to help with work
In the work of rectifying and consolidating public canteens, all localities have secretaries taking the lead and transferring cadres to assist communes in running canteens well. Zunyi Prefecture alone transferred more than 30,000 cadres to assist in the work of more than 26,000 canteens in the area. Many cadres serve as cooks, waiters, or managers in the canteens. All cadres working in the countryside also care about the canteens, eating, living, working, learning, and entertaining with the commune members. Under the slogan of "grasping tightly, grasping realistically, and grasping to the end," party committee secretaries at all levels also personally started to grow "experimental plots" in the canteens. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 19,000 canteen "experimental plots" in the province. In the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, 78% of the county party committee secretaries, 70% of the commune party committee secretaries, 80% of the management area general branch secretaries, and production team branch secretaries have run canteen "experimental plots." In Tongren and Zunyi Prefectures, an average of one out of every five canteens has a canteen "experimental plot." These canteens are all run very well and have become bright red flags, planted in every corner. At the same time, all localities have also adopted the method of going to places with experience to summarize, and going to places with creations to visit, to establish pace-setters and widely carry out the "compare, learn, catch up, help" movement to improve public canteens. Some places have also adopted methods such as intensive training or sending staff from "pace-setter canteens" to provide guidance, actively running some of the poorly-run canteens well.

Firmly establish the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, and increase the number of party members and members elected to participate in canteen work
Firmly establishing the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and selecting party members, Youth League members, and people with high awareness and ability to work in the canteens is the key to running public canteens well. In this work of further improving public canteens, Guizhou localities, as in the past, have continued to resolutely implement this principle, and have increased the number of outstanding party members, Youth League members, and commune members from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds who have been elected to work in public canteens. All localities have paid more attention to enriching the leading backbone for canteens that were previously poorly run. In Wengan County, each commune sent more than 4,100 party members and Youth League members and more than 3,900 activists from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to serve as managers and cooks in canteens with weak leadership. After this adjustment, the vast majority of rural public canteens in the province have established the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants. According to statistics from Qian Southeast, Qian South, Bijie, Tongren, Zunyi and other regions, poor and lower-middle peasants account for about 95% of the more than 480,000 canteen staff. In Tongzi Lane Canteen, Chengguan Commune, Tongren County, the leadership was originally controlled by impure elements, and the canteen was not well run; recently, after re-election, a management committee composed of seven poor and lower-middle peasants was established, which comprehensively arranged the lives of the commune members and improved their food, making the commune members eat well and full, and everyone was satisfied.

Establish democratic management, grain ration management, and financial management systems, hold regular meetings, regularly publicize accounts, and listen to the opinions of the masses
In this work of further improving the canteens, all localities have generally established and improved various systems based on the experience of "pace-setter canteens." Now, more than 90% of the canteens in the province have established democratic management, grain ration management, and financial management systems, and most canteens have established commune member representative meetings and management committees, so that regular meetings are held, accounts are regularly publicized, and the opinions of the masses are listened to. The 22 canteens in Wenquan Management Area, Muyang Commune, Suiyang County, originally had unsound management systems and did not implement the grain saving system well. After implementing the spirit of democratic canteen management, management regulations were generally formulated, accounts were cleared every seven to ten days, and publicized once a month, so that commune members were familiar with the canteen's assets, which facilitated the inspection and supervision of the canteen's work. The commune members in the entire management area put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals, which quickly changed the backwardness of these canteens. Dazhai Canteen, Huaxi Commune, Guiyang City, implements planned grain use, adopting the method of setting quotas per person, calculating to households, centralized storage, and eating with tickets, which not only ensures that the commune members eat their fill, but also saves grain. In just eight days, more than 200 kilograms of grain were saved.

Growing vegetables, raising pigs, raising poultry, establishing canteen assets, vigorously reforming cooking utensils, improving work efficiency, and improving the quality of meals
Establishing the canteen's own assets and actively growing vegetables, raising pigs, and raising poultry are important conditions for consolidating rural canteens. Therefore, all localities have led the canteens to vigorously engage in the production of establishing assets. At present, 90% of the canteens in the province have set aside vegetable plots, planting a total of more than 1.73 million mu of vegetables; more than 70% of the canteens have raised pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish. According to statistics from six prefectures (autonomous prefectures, cities), canteens have raised more than 690,000 pigs. Some canteens have even achieved self-sufficiency and more in meat and vegetables. The 28 canteens in Yizhong Management Area, Lezhi Commune, Nayong County, planted a total of 420 mu of vegetables. Now commune members have enough fresh vegetables to eat every day, and they also use the vegetables they can't finish to make more than 120,000 jin of dried vegetables; these canteens raised a total of 980 pigs and more than 28,000 chickens, which not only improved the lives of the commune members, but also sold 100 pigs, more than 5,000 chickens, and 150,000 eggs to the state, supporting national construction and increasing income by 12,200 yuan.

Vigorously carrying out the renovation of cooking utensils is another important link to adapt to the collectivization of life and consolidate and improve the canteens. There are many rivers and streams and abundant bamboo and wood materials in the mountainous areas of Guizhou. In the past, labor such as carrying water and husking rice was very heavy, and there were objective and subjective conditions for carrying out technological innovation. Therefore, when the party committees at all levels called for the reform of cooking utensils, the vast number of canteen service personnel immediately responded enthusiastically. They installed local tap water, manufactured vegetable cutting machines, changed single stoves to continuous stoves, and changed manual rice husking to hydraulic rice husking, quickly forming a province-wide upsurge in the renovation of cooking utensils. According to statistics from Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Bijie and Anshun Prefectures, more than 54,000 canteens have realized local mechanization and semi-mechanization. Various local machines and tools have replaced manual labor such as carrying water, husking rice, cutting vegetables, and delivering meals. In the canteens of Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the ratio of cooking staff to diners was 1:30 to 40 before the renovation of cooking utensils. After the realization of local mechanization, the ratio became 1:60 to 80 or more. Because the cooking staff used improved cooking utensils to improve work efficiency, they had time to study and improve cooking and cooking methods, and improve the quality of meals. The canteens that reformed cooking utensils in Anshun Prefecture have achieved diversified meals, and the commune members are generally satisfied. The number of people eating in canteens in the region quickly increased from 80% of the total rural population to more than 95% in the past.

Now, all localities in Guizhou are continuing to focus on the rectification and consolidation of public canteens, striving to consolidate all the canteens in the province as soon as possible, and to run them even better.

    温暖的大家庭鼓舞了集体生产、丰富了集体生活、培养了集体主义的新精神
    贵州农村公共食堂成为社会主义坚强阵地
    十一万九千多个食堂越办越好，基层干部和党团员一律参加食堂，社员吃得饱吃得好吃得干净卫生
    许多食堂成为社员集会、学习和文娱活动中心，吸引居民集中到食堂周围，为建设新村创造了条件
    本报贵阳15日电　贵州省十一万九千多个农村公共食堂越办越好，全省农村人民公社94％的社员家庭都参加了公共食堂。现在，食堂已经巩固，实行集体做饭、集体做菜、大家都在食堂吃饭的，已占食堂总数的90％以上。
    公共食堂是巩固人民公社制度的主要阵地，是社员温暖的大家庭
    农村公共食堂，已成为农村中坚实的社会主义阵地。广大群众热情地歌颂食堂说，“人民公社真正好，办好食堂有依靠，饭热菜香吃得饱，生产劲头高又高”。由于食堂越办越好，首先是保证了吃得饱、吃得好、吃得干净卫生，这就使各族社员毫无牵挂地投入生产，促使生产高潮步步高涨。办得好的食堂，往往又是生产小队开会讨论生产，进行学习、文化娱乐的场所，有的已成为生产小队政治、经济、文化活动的中心，形成一个大家庭。这些地方，人民公社得到巩固，生产也搞得很好，充分显示了食堂的优越性和重要性，使食堂成为巩固人民公社制度的主要阵地。有些地方由于办好了食堂，大家有了依靠，有了一个温暖的大家庭，社员们纷纷集中到食堂周围，出现了居民集中的趋势，即由若干很小的居民点，形成一个较大的居民点，这就为建设新村创造了前提条件。现在全省广大农村，以食堂为家的思想正在各族人民中巩固地树立起来。
    把全部食堂都巩固起来使全部食堂都办得更好
    中共贵州省委十分重视农村公共食堂的工作。今年2月中旬，省委召开了一次地（州、市）委第一书记会议，着重地讨论了进一步办好全省农村公共食堂的问题。会议指出，贵州农村公共食堂在当时已有80％左右是巩固的或基本上是巩固的；全省已经出现了一批办得很好的食堂。这些食堂的特点是：一、巩固地树立了贫农、下中农的领导优势；基层干部和党团员一律参加了食堂，和群众打成一片，同甘共苦，千方百计地办好食堂；完全集体做饭、集体做菜，大家都在食堂里吃饭。二、走群众路线，实行民主管理；按月公布账目，群众熟悉食堂家底，人心安定。三、建立了必要的管理制度，首先是口粮管理制度；执行了计划用粮、节约用粮，以人定量，节约归己的原则。四、食堂有了自己的生产，有了家底。食堂种菜、养猪、加工副食品；有的食堂还有一定的粮食储备、相当数量的野生植物淀粉和干菜；并有简易饭厅，备置了桌凳、炊具、食具，便于集中吃饭。五、炊具改革很有成绩，因而减轻了炊事人员的劳动强度，提高了饭菜质量。另外，会议也指出，全省还有20％左右的食堂办得较差，不够巩固，要求各地迅速地把不够巩固的食堂全部巩固起来；所有食堂都要向办得很好的食堂看齐，全部提高一步。各地各级党组织根据省委的指示，从2月下旬开始，就结合春播准备工作，领导社员展开了大规模的进一步办好公共食堂的活动，特别是抓紧了整顿和巩固原先办得较差的食堂的工作。在短短的时间内，使全省办得巩固的食堂，很快增加到食堂总数的90％以上。
    书记挂帅，大办公共食堂“试验田”抽调干部，深入公共食堂帮助工作
    各地在整顿、巩固公共食堂的工作中，都由书记挂帅，抽调干部，协助公社办好食堂。仅遵义专区就抽调三万多名干部，分别到全区二万六千多个食堂中协助工作。许多干部在食堂中当炊事员、服务员或管理人员。各地所有下乡工作的干部，也都关心食堂，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同娱乐。在“抓得紧、抓得实、抓到底”的口号下，各级党委书记还亲自动手，在食堂中种“试验田”。据不完全统计，现在全省已有食堂“试验田”一万九千多个。黔东南苗族侗族自治州有78％的县委书记、70％的公社党委书记、80％的管理区总支书记和生产队支部书记，办了食堂“试验田”。铜仁、遵义两专区，平均每五个食堂中就有一个食堂“试验田”。这些食堂都办得很好，成为一面面鲜艳的红旗，插遍各个角落。同时，各地还采取哪里有经验就到那里去总结，哪里有创造就到那里去参观的办法，树立标兵，广泛开展办好公共食堂的“比、学、赶、帮”运动，有些地方还采取集训或派“标兵食堂”的工作人员前往辅导等办法，积极把一些办得较差的食堂办好。
    巩固地树立贫农和下中农的领导优势增派和选举大批党团员参加食堂工作
    巩固地树立贫农、下中农的领导优势，选派党员、团员和觉悟高、又能干的人到食堂工作，是办好公共食堂的关键。贵州各地在这次进一步办好公共食堂的工作中，同过去一样，继续坚决地贯彻了这一原则，增派和选举了大批优秀党员、团员和贫农、下中农成份的社员到公共食堂工作。各地对于原先办得较差的食堂，更加注意充实领导骨干。瓮安县各公社派到领导力量薄弱的食堂去充当管理人员和炊事员的党员、团员就有四千一百多名，贫农和下中农成份的积极分子三千九百多名。经过这次调整，全省绝大多数农村公共食堂都树立了贫农和下中农的领导优势。据黔东南、黔南、毕节、铜仁、遵义等地区统计，在四十八万多名食堂工作人员中，贫农和下中农占95％左右。铜仁县城关公社桐梓巷食堂，领导权原先掌握在不纯分子手中，食堂办得很不好；最近经过改选，成立了由七个贫农和下中农参加的管理委员会，全面安排了社员生活，改善了伙食，使社员吃得又好又饱，人人满意。
    建立民主管理、口粮管理、财务管理制度定期开会、定期公布账目、倾听群众意见
    在这次进一步办好食堂的工作中，各地都根据“标兵食堂”的经验，普遍地建立和健全了各种制度。现在，全省90％以上的食堂建立了民主管理、口粮管理、财务管理等制度，大部分食堂成立了社员代表会、管理委员会，作到了定期开会，定期公布账目，听取群众意见。绥阳县募阳公社温泉管理区二十二个食堂，原来管理制度不健全，节约粮食制度执行得不好，经过贯彻民主办食堂的精神，普遍订立了管理条例，七至十天一清理账目，一月一公布，使社员熟悉食堂家底，便于对食堂工作进行检查和监督，全管理区社员先后提出了合理化建议一千多条，迅速改变了这些食堂的落后面貌。贵阳市花溪公社大寨食堂实行计划用粮，采取以人定量，计算到户，集中保管，凭票吃饭的办法，不仅保证了社员吃饱，而且节约了粮食，仅八天时间就节约粮食二百多斤。
    种菜、养猪、养家禽，建立食堂家底大搞炊具改革，提高工效提高饭菜质量
    建立食堂自己的家底，积极种菜、养猪、养家禽，是巩固农村食堂的重要条件。因此，各地都领导食堂大搞建立家底的生产。目前全省90％的食堂已划出菜地，共种菜一百七十三万多亩；70％以上的食堂养了猪、鸡、鸭、鱼。据六个专区（州、市）统计，食堂养猪已达六十九万多头。有些食堂还做到了肉、菜自给有余。纳雍县乐治公社义中管理区二十八个食堂共种蔬菜四百二十亩，现在社员每天都有足够的新鲜蔬菜吃，还用吃不完的蔬菜制干菜十二万多斤；这些食堂共养猪九百八十头，养鸡二万八千多只，不仅改善了社员们的生活，还卖给国家一百头猪、五千多只鸡和十五万个鸡蛋，支援了国家建设，增加了收入一万二千二百多元。
    大搞炊具革新，是适应生活集体化，巩固、提高食堂的又一重要环节。贵州山区河流溪水多、竹木材料充足，过去挑水、舂米等劳动十分繁重，具备大搞技术革新的主客观条件。因此，这次当各级党委号召改革炊事工具时，广大食堂服务人员立即热烈响应。他们自己动手，安装土自来水、制造切菜机、改单灶为连灶、改人力舂米为水力舂米，很快就形成了席卷全省的炊具革新热潮。据黔南布依族苗族自治州和毕节、安顺两专区统计，有五万四千多个食堂已经实现了土机械化和半机械化，各种土机具代替了挑水、舂米、切菜、送饭菜等手工劳动。黔南布依族苗族自治州的食堂，在革新炊事工具以前，炊事人员和用饭人员的比例是一比三十到四十，实现土机械化后，比例变成了一比六十到八十以上。由于炊事人员使用改良炊具，提高了工效，他们已有时间研究改进做饭、做菜方法，提高了饭菜的质量。安顺专区改革了炊具的食堂，都做到了饭菜多样化，社员们普遍感到满意，全区在食堂吃饭的人数，很快由过去占农村总人口80％增加到95％以上。
    现在，贵州各地还在继续抓紧公共食堂的整顿、巩固工作，争取尽快地把全省的食堂都巩固起来，并且把它办得更好。
