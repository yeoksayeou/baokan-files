Comprehensive report from this newspaper: The 1959 Industrial Department Labor Model Congress of North Vietnam opened in Hanoi on the 10th. Attending the congress were 400 male and female labor models, who emerged from approximately 70,000 workers and technicians in state-owned enterprises under the Industrial Department of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam last year.

　　Le Thanh Nghi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Minister of Industry, delivered a report at the congress on the situation of the 1959 competition movement in the industrial sector and the policy of the competition movement this year. In his report, he pointed out that in order to complete the tasks of the industrial sector in 1960, all labor models, advanced workers, cadres, and workers must correctly implement the production competition policy of "more, faster, better, more economical, steady, sustainable, comprehensive progress, and ensuring labor safety" put forward by the Party Central Committee and the government. They must vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to participate in the competition movement of "striving to become advanced workers, advanced production teams, and advanced units," vigorously promote collective competition movements, and vigorously promote technical innovation and improve labor organization so as to continuously improve production efficiency and reduce costs.

　　Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, extended warm congratulations to the representatives of the Labor Model Congress.

　　He pointed out that in last year's competition movement, 1,963 labor models and more than 20,000 advanced workers emerged in enterprises under the Industrial Department. He said that this proves the great progress and creativity of the Vietnamese working class. It also proves that the Vietnamese working class and people are determined to advance along the path of industrialization and socialism and are determined to fight for the reunification of the country.

　　He said that these brilliant achievements should first of all be attributed to the strong socialist enthusiasm shown by industrial workers and all other working people in their labor. This kind of labor enthusiasm has enabled the continuous progress of the competition movement of technical innovation, management, and labor organization carried out in state-owned enterprises.

　　He called on workers to complete and overfulfill the 1960 production plan and prepare conditions for the first five-year plan starting next year. He emphasized that everyone must abide by the principle of "more, faster, better, more economical" while ensuring safe production. He also said that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to make continuous improvements in working methods and technology.

　　President Ho Chi Minh attended the 1959 Labor Model Congress of the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry on the 11th. In his speech at the meeting, he called on the labor models to play a leading role and help the backward so that they can improve together and strive to overfulfill the national plan ahead of schedule.

　　President Ho Chi Minh called for efforts to promote the 1960 competition movement so that it can be carried out enthusiastically, steadily, and sustainably, and it must be done more, faster, better, and more economically. President Ho Chi Minh said that more and faster means diligence, and better and more economical means frugality. Diligence and frugality mean improving labor productivity and improving product quality. To achieve more, faster, better, and more economical, it must be combined with ensuring labor safety. The competition must also be carried out continuously, so it is necessary to improve technology and improve organization, rather than increase labor intensity, and it is necessary to consolidate and develop the good results of the enterprise management reform movement.

　　President Ho Chi Minh said that in the past year, the workers of various enterprises have developed the spirit of daring to think and act, and put forward many good rationalization proposals. Responsible cadres must pay attention to studying the workers' rationalization proposals in a timely manner, and must supplement, adopt, and promote them.

　　President Ho Chi Minh instructed the labor models, cadres, party members, and league members must play a leading and exemplary role in all work. He instructed everyone to learn from the Soviet worker Gaganova, actively help the backward, so as to make progress together, and advanced enterprises should also help backward enterprises.

    越南劳动党中央和政府提出生产竞赛方针
    多快好省、稳当、持续、全面迈进
    胡志明号召劳动模范帮助后进共同提高
    范文同赞扬劳动人民的社会主义热情
    本报综合报道　越南北方1959年工业部劳动模范大会10日在河内开幕。出席这次大会的有四百名男女劳动模范，他们是去年从越南民主共和国工业部所属国营企业中的大约七万名工人和技术人员中涌现出来的。
    越南劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、工业部长黎清毅在大会上作了关于工业部门1959年竞赛运动的情况和今年竞赛运动的方针的报告。他在报告中指出，为了完成1960年工业部门的任务，全体劳动模范、先进劳动者以及干部和工人，必须正确贯彻执行党中央和政府提出的“多快好省、稳当、持续、全面迈进和保证劳动安全”的生产竞赛方针，必须大力动员、组织群众参加“争取成为先进劳动者、先进生产组和先进单位”的竞赛运动，大力推进集体竞赛运动，并大搞技术革新、改善劳动组织，以便不断地提高生产效率，降低成本。
    范文同总理代表越南劳动党中央委员会向劳动模范大会的代表们表示热烈的祝贺。
    他指出，在去年的竞赛运动中，工业部所属企业出现了一千九百六十三名劳动模范和两万多名先进劳动者。他说，这证明越南工人阶级的巨大的进步和创造力。这也证明越南工人阶级和人民决心沿着工业化和社会主义的道路前进，并且决心为国家的重新统一而进行斗争。
    他说，这些光辉的成绩首先应归功于产业工人和所有其他劳动人民在劳动中所表现的强烈的社会主义热情。这种劳动热情使得在国营企业中开展的技术革新、管理和劳动组织的竞赛运动获得了继续不断的进步。
    他号召工人完成和超额完成1960年的生产计划，并为明年开始的第一个五年计划准备条件。他强调说，每一个人都必须在保证安全生产的同时，遵守“生产多、快、好、省”的方针。他又说，为了达到这一目的，有必要在工作方法和技术方面进行不断的改进。
    胡志明主席11日出席了越南工业部1959年劳动模范大会。他在会上讲话时号召劳动模范们要发挥带头作用，帮助后进，以便共同提高，力争提前超额完成国家计划。
    胡志明主席号召努力推进1960年的竞赛运动，使它能够热烈、稳当和持续开展，必须做到多快好省。胡志明主席说，多、快就是勤，好省就是俭，勤俭就是提高劳动生产率和提高产品质量。要作到多快好省必须与保证劳动安全相结合。竞赛还要做到持续开展，因此必须改进技术，改进组织，而不是加强劳动强度，必须巩固和发挥企业管理改革运动的良好结果。
    胡志明主席说，一年来，各企业工人已发挥了敢想敢做的精神，提出了许多好的合理化建议。负责干部必须及时注意研究工人的合理化建议，并且要加以补充、采用和推广。
    胡志明主席嘱咐劳动模范、干部、党员、团员们必须在一切工作中起火车头和模范作用。他嘱咐大家向苏联工人加干诺娃学习，主动地帮助后进，以便共同进步，先进企业也要帮助后进企业。（附图片）
