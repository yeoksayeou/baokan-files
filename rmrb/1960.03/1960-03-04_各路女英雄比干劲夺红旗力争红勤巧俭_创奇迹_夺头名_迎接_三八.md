Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd – Throughout the nation, women on all fronts have launched a widespread Redness, Diligence, Skill, and Thrift competition, competing in drive and seizing red flags, using outstanding production and work achievements to welcome the 50th anniversary of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day.

	Technical Innovation Brings Good News
On the industrial front, female workers are carrying out competitions centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, with frequent good news. According to statistics from 50 factories and mines in the five cities of Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Jinzhou, and Liaoyang in Liaoning Province, female workers put forward more than 13,000 technical innovation proposals in January and February, many of which have already been implemented, greatly improving labor efficiency. In Shanghai, female workers in various factories quickly launched a "compare, learn, catch up, help" upsurge through the selection of "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetters" and "March 8th Red Banner Collectives." After Lu Hezhen, a technical innovation expert from the Huasheng Electric Motor Factory, was selected as a candidate for "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter," female workers throughout the factory immediately launched a "catch up with Lu Hezhen" campaign. The female workers in the Third Workshop realized more than 300 technical innovations in just a few days. After the Yi Shijuan Group of the No. 2 State Cotton Factory was selected as a candidate for the "March 8th Red Banner Collective," the female workers in the group went to fraternal factories to learn high-speed operation experience to further improve themselves. At the same time, they actively helped others, striving to enable 80% of the female workers in the factory to reach the level of experts before "March 8th." Under the guidance of experienced workers, more than 1,400 female workers at the Hudong Shipyard created a "March 8th Women" tugboat with a 20-day building cycle, which was launched on March 1st. The female workers in the "March 8th" workshop of the Tianjin Lifting and Transport Equipment Factory realized a semi-automatic production line for screw processing in the competition, increasing production efficiency by 240 times. Hu Suqing, the leader of the Thirteen Sisters Carpet Weaving Group in the carpet workshop of the Xining Fur Factory in Qinghai Province, recently proposed to change the manual operation of the upper warp and flat weaving processes in carpet production to machine operation after hard research. According to her suggestion, the upper warp machine and flat weaving machine successfully trial-produced can initially increase work efficiency by five times and forty times respectively. The female youth quenching group of the Harbin Sharp Tool Factory recently successfully created an umbrella-shaped turntable lifting heat treatment automated production line, ending the manual operation of file quenching and shortening the production cycle from the original 48 hours to 5 minutes.

	Accumulating Manure and Fighting Drought Makes Great Contributions
Under slogans such as "Creating Miracles and Striving for Top Honors to Welcome March 8th with Great Achievements," the vast number of rural women have actively engaged in wheat field management, spring plowing, drought prevention, pig raising, and manure accumulation, achieving great results. The number of women participating in spring plowing has recently increased in many areas, and in some areas, almost all women with labor ability have participated in spring plowing. More than 30,000 women in Pingwu County, Sichuan Province, launched a climax of vigorously attacking the three types of seedlings in the spring crops. In early February, after seven days of effort, they universally cultivated, top-dressed, applied surface soil, and controlled pests on more than 48,000 mu of alpine spring crops and more than 31,000 mu of river dam spring land. The wheat they manage has now basically eliminated the three types of seedlings. Women in the cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province proposed to greet their festival with the achievement of managing 2 million mu of high-yield cotton fields. In the Guanzhong area, which is rich in cotton, every people's commune has a women's high-yield field. In Sanyuan County, 120,000 women are responsible for planting 15 high-yield fields of 5,000 mu, 50 high-yield fields of 1,000 mu, and 250 high-yield fields of 500 mu, totaling 250,000 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 35% of the county's total cotton field area. All these high-yield cotton fields have been deeply ploughed to a depth of eight inches to one foot, and each mu has been fertilized with 20,000 jin of base fertilizer and irrigated once. Women in Yichun, Gannan, Fuzhou, and other regions of Jiangxi Province planted 920,000 mu of early rice experimental fields, and have now carefully selected seeds, prepared sufficient fertilizers, and prepared seedbeds for these experimental fields. Women in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, organized 790 "March 8th Manure Accumulation Shock Teams," accumulating more than 11 million dan of manure in one month. Rural women in the Liuzhou area of Guangxi launched a shock month campaign focusing on improving spring plowing production, living welfare, and pig raising. Currently, the number of women's pig farms in the area has surged from 14 before January to more than 13,000, and a large number of pig-raising pacesetters have emerged. The vast number of rural women also actively participated in high-efficiency activities centered on tool reform. Women in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, successfully reformed the "slope-style soil transporter," increasing work efficiency by five times and greatly accelerating the progress of fertilizer transportation.

	Sisters on the Finance, Trade, Culture, and Education Fronts Report Double Good News
Women on the finance, trade, culture, and education fronts have also made many new achievements to welcome their festival. Female commercial employees in various regions actively improved their work methods, improved service quality, and worked with male employees to organize the lives of urban people. More than 800 female employees in the commercial system of the Xining area of Qinghai Province recently held a mobilization meeting, issuing a proposal to female employees on the commercial front of the province to complete the commercial work indicators of the first quarter one month in advance in an all-round way and greet the "March 8th" festival with practical actions. After the meeting, female employees in the commercial system of the province immediately took action. The female employees of the grocery store No. 1 of the Dongguan Canteen in Xining City purchased more than 37,000 jin of goods such as vegetable leaves and baking soda in the two days after the meeting. They also widely carried out activities such as door-to-door delivery to better serve residents and employees' families. Women in the Shanghai literary and art circles are also actively creating new achievements to welcome "March 8th." The Tianma Film Studio is rushing to shoot a feature film composed of three short films depicting female workers, female breeders, and female students, entitled "Their Wishes." Female writer Ru Zhijuan participated in the screenwriting work, and famous actress Bai Yang served as director for the first time, directing one of the short films; most of the cinematographers and other crew members are also female film workers.
