New Homes for Cooperative Farmers

After the Cuban Revolution, the Cuban government promulgated the Land Reform Law, abolishing the large estate system, and the vast number of farmers began a new life on the land they had been allotted. They have organized cooperatives one after another and begun to develop diverse economic crops in order to change the deformed single economy of only growing sugar cane and tobacco that was created by the American monopoly capitalists in the past.

In addition, cooperatives have also built many new houses, hospitals, department stores, and schools to improve the lives of farmers.

The above picture shows the newly built houses of the “San Juan Two Brothers Cooperative” in Pinar del Río province. Farmers are about to move from dilapidated houses to live here.

    合作社农民的新住宅
    古巴革命后，古巴政府颁布了土地改革法，废除了大庄园制度，广大农民在分得的土地上开始了新的生活。他们纷纷组织合作社，开始发展多种经济作物，以改变过去美国垄断资本家所造成的只种甘蔗、烟草等畸形的单一经济。
    此外，合作社还新建了许多住宅、医院、百货商店和学校等，改善农民生活。
    上图是皮那尔省“圣胡安两兄弟合作社”刚建好的新房屋。农民们即将由破旧的房屋里搬到这里来居住。
