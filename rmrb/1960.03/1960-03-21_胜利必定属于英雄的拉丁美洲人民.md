    Victory Surely Belongs to the Heroic People of Latin America

To the Editorial Staff:

    As "Support Latin American People's Week" begins, we wish to express our utmost excitement to our dear Latin American brothers through you.

    Dear Latin American brothers: We firmly support you. Because we know that your struggle is our struggle.

    Dear Latin American brothers: Who supported Chiang Kai-shek riding on our backs in the past, and today uses the big plantation owners and reactionary groups to shackle you? Who made a fortune by plundering our grain and raw materials in the past, and today is still robbing you of your oil and rubber? Who still occupies our sacred territory of Taiwan today, while also refusing to leave the Panama Canal Zone and occupying many military bases in Latin America? Who attempts to intimidate us by launching missiles, while also dropping a large number of bombs on Cuban territory? This is the vicious and evil U.S. imperialism. This wolf is our common enemy.

    There is an old saying: "When you find a clear spring, don't forget the brothers in distress in the desert." Dear Latin American brothers, how can the 650 million Chinese people who have already taken control of their own destiny forget you, and how can they not wholeheartedly support your struggle!

    Dear Latin American brothers, we, like all the Chinese people, firmly believe that in the struggle for national independence against U.S. imperialism, the final victory will surely belong to you. Look! On the Caribbean coast, the tall palm trees standing still against the wind and rain are a symbol of the indomitable fighting spirit of the Latin American people! We know that not long ago, the Latin American people's leaflets of "No Interference in Cuba" frightened Eisenhower into hiding in a helicopter. We firmly believe that the Latin American people, hand in hand, will persist in their struggle and eventually kick the Americans and their running dogs into the sea!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the Latin American people!

### 胜利必定属于英雄的拉丁美洲人民

    胜利必定属于英雄的拉丁美洲人民编辑同志：
    在“支援拉丁美洲人民周”开始举行的时候，我们希望通过你们，向亲爱的拉丁美洲兄弟们表达我们万分激动的心情。
    亲爱的拉丁美洲兄弟们：我们坚决支持你们。因为我们知道，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。
    亲爱的拉丁美洲兄弟们：是谁，过去支持蒋介石骑在我们头上，今天又利用大庄园主和反动集团给你们带上枷锁？是谁，过去靠掠夺我们的粮食、原料发横财，今天还抢劫着你们的石油、橡胶？是谁，今天还霸占着我们神圣的领土台湾，同时又赖在巴拿马运河区不走并且在拉丁美洲占领着很多军事基地？是谁，妄图发射导弹来恫吓我们，同时又把大量炸弹倾倒在古巴的领土上。这就是穷凶极恶的美帝国主义。这只豺狼是我们共同的敌人。
    有一句古话说：“找到了清泉，别忘了沙漠里患难的弟兄”。亲爱的拉丁美洲兄弟们，已经掌握了自己命运的六亿五千万中国人民怎么能忘记你们，怎么能不全心全意地支援你们的斗争！
    亲爱的拉丁美洲兄弟们，我们，和全体中国人民一样，坚信在争取民族独立反对美帝国主义的斗争中，最后的胜利必定属于你们。看！加勒比海海岸上，在大风雨中屹立不动高耸入云的棕榈，正是拉丁美洲人民不屈斗志的象征！我们知道，不久前，拉丁美洲人民的“不许干涉古巴”的传单，曾经把艾森豪威尔吓得躲在直升飞机里。我们坚信，携起手来的拉丁美洲人民坚持斗争，终将把美国佬和它的走狗们一同踢进大海里！
    中国人民和拉丁美洲人民的友谊万岁！
