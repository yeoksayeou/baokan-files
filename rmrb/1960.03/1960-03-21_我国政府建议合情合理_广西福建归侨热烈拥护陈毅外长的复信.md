Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 19th: Returned Overseas Chinese in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region warmly endorse Foreign Minister Chen Yi's reply to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on the Overseas Chinese issue. Returned Overseas Chinese are also using their personal experiences to expose the persecution and harassment of Overseas Chinese by powerful groups in Indonesia.

Lei Peihong, Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and others pointed out that Foreign Minister Chen's reply further embodies the positive attitude consistently adopted by our government in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. The suggestions made in Foreign Minister Chen's letter are reasonable and just, and are aimed at safeguarding and consolidating the friendly relations between the two countries in every way.

Li Jincai, a returned Overseas Chinese recently returned to the motherland and settled in the Nanning Automobile Repair Factory, said, "I worked in Bangka Island, Indonesia for more than 40 years. Last year, the relevant authorities said I was old and fired me. I had no means of living there. I applied to return to China, but was met with all kinds of harassment. On the one hand, they said I was old, and on the other hand, they asked me and my wife to pay marriage tax, and my children to pay birth tax. We can't even maintain our daily lives, and we can't afford to pay so much money. As a result, only four of our family of more than 20 people were allowed to return." Li Jincai said angrily, "May I ask the Indonesian authorities, what does it mean to persecute Overseas Chinese in your country, dismiss them, make them homeless, and not allow them to return home smoothly?"

The Indonesian returned Overseas Chinese who arrived at the Wuming Overseas Chinese Farm on March 12th and settled down were all elated after reading Foreign Minister Chen's reply and expressed their warm support. Chen Jinxing and Wang Danan, who returned from Cilamaya, Indonesia, said that the Indonesian authorities have repeatedly stated that they will do their best to assist Overseas Chinese who are willing to return home, but we have been subjected to insults and persecution from being forced to move to the accommodation centers to boarding the ship back home. In the beginning, the local authorities in Karawang demanded that each of us put one hundred and eight fingerprints on various forms. The vehicles from the accommodation centers to Jakarta were our own, but the local authorities sent a large number of military police to escort us and forced the vehicles to be dispersed, separating luggage and people. Many of our luggage was lost in this way. On the day of boarding the ship, the relevant Indonesian authorities made us wait at the dock from morning until twelve o'clock at night. How can these facts be said to be assisting us in returning home?

Xinhua News Agency, Quanzhou, 20th: Returned Overseas Chinese attending the joint (expanded) meeting of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese in Quanzhou unanimously and warmly endorsed Foreign Minister Chen Yi's reply to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on the Overseas Chinese issue on March 15th. They unanimously believe that as long as the Indonesian government truly abides by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and conducts friendly consultations with our government, the Overseas Chinese issue can be resolved comprehensively and reasonably at an early date, and the friendly relations between the two countries can be further developed.

Guo Ruiren, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said: "The Indonesian Foreign Minister has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of obstructing Overseas Chinese from returning home and is willing to do his best to assist them. However, when our country sent ships to pick up Overseas Chinese, it was constantly obstructed by the Indonesian side. We hope that the relevant Indonesian authorities can truly value the friendship between the two countries and, on the basis of the six requirements put forward by our government, quickly reach an agreement on the repatriation of Overseas Chinese through consultation, and immediately take effective measures to ensure that all Overseas Chinese who are willing to return home can return smoothly."

Gao Zhirong, Chairman of the Fuqing County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, used a large number of facts from his own experience to illustrate the role played by Overseas Chinese in the economic development of Indonesia and said: "Now that the relevant Indonesian authorities emphasize that Overseas Chinese are not suitable for the economic development of Indonesia, then Overseas Chinese should be allowed to return with their funds and belongings. However, Overseas Chinese are subjected to all kinds of harassment when they want to return. Some of the Overseas Chinese who returned on the last ship had even their straw mats, shorts and slippers confiscated. Is this the attitude that should be taken towards the nationals of friendly countries?"

    我国政府建议合情合理
    广西福建归侨热烈拥护陈毅外长的复信
    据新华社南宁19日电　广西僮族自治区的归国华侨，热烈拥护陈毅外长就华侨问题给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的复信。归国华侨们并以亲身的经历，揭露印度尼西亚有势力集团对华侨的迫害和刁难。
    广西僮族自治区归国华侨联合会主席雷沛鸿等人指出，陈外长的复信进一步体现了我国政府解决华侨问题所一贯采取的积极态度。陈外长信中提出的建议合情合理，处处在维护和巩固两国之间的友好关系。
    最近回到祖国被安置在南宁汽车修配厂工作的归侨李进才说，我在印度尼西亚汶岛作了四十多年工，去年有关当局说我年老将我解雇，我在那里生活无着，申请回国，却遭到种种刁难。他们一方面说我老，另方面又要我和妻子交结婚税，儿女交出生税。我们平时生活都不能维持，没有能力交那么多钱，结果我一家二十多口人只让回来四个人。李进才气愤地说，请问印度尼西亚当局，华侨在你们那里受迫害，被解雇，流离失所，又不让他们顺利回国，这究竟是什么意思？
    3月12日到达武鸣华侨农场安家落户的印度尼西亚归侨，在读了陈外长的复信后个个欢欣鼓舞，表示热烈拥护。从印度尼西亚芝拦马夜回来的陈晋星、王大南说，印度尼西亚当局一再表示对愿意回国的华侨尽力协助，但是我们从被迫迁往收容所到登船回国，一直受着侮辱迫害。开始，加拦横地方当局要我们每个人在各种表格上盖上一百零八个手指印，从收容所到雅加达的车辆是我们自己的，而地方当局却派大批军警押送，并强使车辆分散，把行李和人分开，我们许多行李都是这样丢失的。在上船那天，印度尼西亚有关当局要我们从早上一直在码头上等到晚上十二点。这些事实，怎么能说是协助我们回国呢？
    据新华社泉州20日电　在泉州出席福建省华侨事务委员会、福建省归国华侨联合会委员联席（扩大）会议的归国华侨，一致热烈拥护陈毅外交部长3月15日就华侨问题给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的复信。他们一致认为，只要印度尼西亚政府真正遵守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，和我国政府进行友好协商，华侨问题是可以早日获得全面和合理的解决的，两国之间的友好关系也可以得到进一步的发展。
    福建省归国华侨联合会副主席、印度尼西亚归国华侨郭瑞人说：“印度尼西亚外交部长一再声明无意阻挠华侨回国，而且愿意尽力给予协助。可是我国派船去接运侨胞时，却不断受到从印度尼西亚方面来的阻挠。我们希望印度尼西亚有关当局能够真正以两国友谊为重，在我国政府提出的六点要求的基础上，通过协商迅速达成一项关于遣送华侨回国的协议，并且立即采取有效措施，保证所有愿意回国的华侨，能够顺利地回来。”
    福清县归国华侨联合会主席、印度尼西亚归国华侨高至荣，用亲身经历的大量事实说明了华侨对发展印度尼西亚经济所起的作用后说：“现在印度尼西亚有关当局既然强调华侨对印度尼西亚的经济发展不相适应，那么就应该让华侨带着他们的资金和物品回来。但是侨胞们要回来却受到百般刁难。乘搭上一次班船回来的侨胞中，有些人连草席、短裤和拖鞋都被扣留，这是对友好国家侨民所应该采取的态度吗？”
