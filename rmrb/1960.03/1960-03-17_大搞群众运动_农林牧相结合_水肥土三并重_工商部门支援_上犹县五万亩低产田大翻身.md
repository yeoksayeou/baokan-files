From our correspondent in Nanchang: Thirty thousand cadres and members in Shangyou County, Jiangxi Province, slept in mountain caves and fought on mountain ridges for three months of expeditionary warfare, completely turning around 50,000 mu of low-yield land.

Shangyou County is located in the mountainous area of southern Jiangxi. Out of the county's 190,000 mu of paddy fields, 64,000 mu are distributed in high, cold mountain pits. Last year, the average yield per mu was below 300 jin, making them the county's low-yield fields. The Shangyou County Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that to achieve a balanced increase in grain production in 1960, it was first necessary to vigorously transform low-yield fields. Therefore, after the autumn harvest last year, it organized more than ten investigation teams. After investigation and research, the causes of low yield were found: some lacked water conservancy facilities and were prone to drought; some suffered from severe soil erosion and had shallow topsoil; some had cold, sticky mud and low soil temperature; some suffered from insufficient sunshine due to high mountains and many trees, and so on. In response to these low-yield causes and the experience accumulated by the masses over the years in transforming low-yield fields, the county party committee and the party committees of various communes formulated plans and specific measures for transforming low-yield fields. Subsequently, the county party committee issued a battle call to the people of the county: "Sleep in mountain caves, eat in the open, go on expeditionary warfare this winter and spring, and make a complete turnaround for low-yield fields!" More than 30,000 cadres and members of the county immediately marched towards the low-yield fields, holding high the red flag of "Great Battle for Low-Yield Fields" and carrying tools, clothes, and bedding. After more than three months of hard work, more than 10,000 mountain ponds, reservoirs, and other water conservancy projects have been built for low-yield fields; 40 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, averaging 630 dan per mu; and more than 20,000 mu of trees have been planted and more than 4,000 mu of pasture have been planted to prevent rainwater from eroding low-yield fields. In addition, more than 300 livestock farms and more than 1,000 indigenous fertilizer factories have been set up next to low-yield fields, specializing in accumulating and producing fertilizer for low-yield fields. According to the county party committee's recent inspection results, more than 51,000 mu of the county's 64,000 mu of low-yield fields have been completely transformed, and double-cropping rice can be planted this year. The remaining 13,000 mu have also undergone preliminary changes.

The Shangyou County Party Committee summarized the main experiences in transforming low-yield fields quickly and well: "The Party leads the movement, shock brigades live in the fields, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are combined, water, fertilizer, and soil are emphasized simultaneously, and all departments cooperate closely."

The primary key to Shangyou County's victory in transforming low-yield fields lies in strengthening Party leadership and launching a massive mass movement. The county and commune party committees established leading bodies for transforming low-yield fields, with the first secretary personally taking charge and establishing special offices. Party committees at all levels sent more than 700 cadres deep into the mountain pits to eat, live, and work with the shock brigade members, leading commune members in the battle.

Shangyou County regards the combination of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry as the fundamental way to address both the symptoms and the root causes of transforming low-yield fields. Agriculture means planting green manure extensively in low-yield fields to improve soil quality. More than 40,000 mu of green manure crops have been sown in low-yield fields throughout the county, more than three times more than in previous years. At the same time, weeds were cut down in the mountains, generally ensuring that there were no weeds within three zhang of the fields, increasing the amount of sunlight reaching the shady fields. Forestry means planting trees and pasture around the mountains, which prevents soil erosion and washing away of fields, develops forestry, and provides pasture for animal husbandry. Animal husbandry means establishing large-scale livestock farms next to low-yield fields, which not only accumulates large amounts of high-quality fertilizer for low-yield fields year-round, transforming the soil, but also develops pig farming, killing two birds with one stone.

Simultaneously emphasizing water, fertilizer, and soil is another fundamental way to address both the symptoms and the root causes of transforming low-yield fields in Shangyou County. Water, first, means digging ditches around the mountains, building embankments along the mountains, and building dams at the mouths of ditches to prevent mountain floods from destroying fields, and digging sand sedimentation ponds in drainage ditches to allow silt carried in the water to settle and not flow into the fields; second, for mountain-lined fields with insufficient water sources, building mountain ponds and reservoirs according to the principle of "storing water as the main priority, small-scale as the main priority" to ensure farmland water use; and third, digging ring field ditches to drain cold spring water out of the fields, and winter plowing and sunning of fields to turn cold, sticky mud into hot, sticky mud. This past winter and spring, more than 5,000 flood discharge ditches and more than 3,000 irrigation canals have been opened up for low-yield fields throughout the county, and more than 1,600 new mountain ponds and reservoirs have been built, which will effectively and comprehensively control mountain flood damage and basically meet the water needs of low-yield fields this year. Fertilizer, in addition to establishing large-scale livestock farms and indigenous fertilizer factories in low-yield fields and planting green manure, also vigorously cuts green manure, shovels turf to make pit fertilizer and compost fertilizer. More than 65,000 manure pits have been composted throughout the county, reaching one pit per mu and 100 dan of fertilizer per pit. Soil, one is to carry "guest soil" into sandy fields and shallow-footed fields to change or increase the cultivated layer; two is to carry hard soil into the cold, sticky mud fields with deep mud feet; and three is to plow and harrow more, plow and harrow finely, cultivate carefully and skillfully, so that the soil particles are fine and the ground is as flat as a mirror, which is convenient for crop growth. Now, all low-yield fields have been finely plowed and harrowed three to four times, and more than 10,000 mu of sandy fields have been carried into "guest soil" to change the cultivated layer.

Transforming low-yield fields is a major event for the people of the county. Therefore, before the army for transforming low-yield fields set off, the county party committee organized industrial, commercial, and other departments to closely cooperate and support, sending people deep into the low-yield field areas to help various communes build work sheds, select locations for pig farms and fertilizer factories, and install telephone lines. As the pioneer teams set up camp, commercial departments sent more than 100 sets of peddler's loads; medical departments sent 13 medical brigades; and handicraft departments sent more than 500 carpenters, basket weavers, and ironworkers to manufacture and repair tools for the army.

Title: Grasping Mating to Ensure Pregnancy, Grasping Gestation to Ensure Full Survival: Shandong Launches a Livestock Production Blitz Month
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th: A livestock production blitz month movement with the main content of vigorously grasping mating, protecting fetuses, and hatching is being launched in various parts of Shandong.

Since entering February, various parts of Shandong Province have successively launched blitz ten-days and blitz months, and vigorously grasped spring mating. Up to now, 62.6% of the province's 990,000 heads of breeding cows, donkeys, and mares have conceived during the spring mating, plus the originally pregnant ones. In order to further carry out the spring mating and fetal protection of large and small livestock and poultry hatching work, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on the evening of the 13th, calling on the whole party and the whole people to combine the central task of fighting drought to protect wheat and spring planting from now until April 15 to carry out a blitz month movement for mating, fetal protection, and hatching. The main content of the blitz month movement is: extensively carry out the activities of "two grasps, two protections, and one hatch" (grasp mating to ensure pregnancy, grasp gestation to ensure full survival, and one household hatches one brood of poultry) to ensure that livestock achieve full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full strength, and poultry spring hatching should complete more than 70% of the annual task. Large livestock should strive to mate as much as possible before March 20, so that pregnant livestock can give birth this year, which is the first hurdle to ensuring that large livestock can make a great leap forward this year. For pigs and sheep, it is mainly to continue to promote the experience of heavy mating and re-mating to achieve multiple births, high yields, and increased litter size and survival rate.

In order to reduce miscarriages and prevent miscarriages of pregnant livestock, the provincial party committee requires that any pregnant livestock that needs to reduce labor should resolutely reduce labor; if it needs complete rest, it should resolutely let it rest completely. At the same time, every commune must establish a livestock and poultry hospital, and all pregnant livestock must enter the livestock and poultry hospital before delivery, implement scientific delivery, and be managed by special personnel. At the same time, it is necessary to universally establish young livestock farms so that young livestock can achieve full birth, full survival, and full strength.

The provincial party committee also pointed out that each commune should establish a livestock farm of appropriate scale according to its conditions to demonstrate the mating, fetal protection, hatching, and feeding management of livestock and poultry, and concentrate the livestock that some units are weak and temporarily unable to raise well, so that they can be raised and managed well, which can not only reduce the weakness and death of livestock, but also demonstrate the restoration of fat and strength.

The provincial party committee emphasized that strengthening Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of animal husbandry and the continued leap forward in animal husbandry production this year. All localities must make up their minds to equip full-time secretaries, improve and strengthen the professional institutions for animal husbandry production, train technical personnel, strengthen the animal husbandry team, insert red flags, establish models, and organize a competition movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping between communes and farms, so that the animal husbandry production movement continues to leap forward wave after wave.

    大搞群众运动　农林牧相结合　水肥土三并重　工商部门支援
    上犹县五万亩低产田大翻身
    本报南昌电　江西上犹县三万名干部社员夜宿山洞、日战山岗，远征野战三个月，使五万亩低产田彻底翻身。
    上犹县位于赣南山区，全县十九万亩稻田中有六万四千亩分布在山高水冷的山坑，去年平均亩产量在三百斤以下，是全县的低产田。中共上犹县委认为实现1960年粮食平衡增产，首先必须大力改造低产田。因而在去年秋收后就组织了十多个调查组，经过调查研究找到了低产原因：有的是水利设施少，容易受旱；有的是水土流失严重，土层浅薄；有的是冷浆泥，土温低；有的因山高树多遮盖了阳光，日照不足等等。针对这些低产原因和群众多年来积累的改造低产田经验，县委和各公社党委制定了改造低产田的规划和具体措施。接着，县委向全县人民发出了“山洞宿、露天餐，远征野战一冬春，要低产田大翻身”的战斗号召，全县三万多名干部社员立即举着“大战低产田”的红旗，背着工具、衣被，全面向低产田进军。经过三个多月的奋战，至今已为低产田兴修了一万多处山塘、水库等各种水利工程；积造了四千万担肥料，平均每亩达六百三十担；为了防止雨水冲刷低产田，已植树造林二万多亩，种植牧草四千多亩。此外，还在低产田旁办起了三百多个畜牧场、一千多个土化肥厂，专门为低产田积造与生产肥料。根据县委最近检查结果，全县六万四千多亩低产田中已经有五万一千多亩得到了彻底改造，今年可以种植双季水稻，其余一万三千亩也已初步改变了面貌。
    上犹县改造低产田既快又好，县委总结了主要经验是：“党领导搞运动，突击队住田头，农林牧相结合，水肥土三并重，各部门紧配合。”
    上犹县改造低产田取胜的首要一点，还在于加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。县和公社党委成立了改造低产田的领导机构，第一书记亲自挂帅，专设办公室；各级党委派出了七百多名干部深入山坑，与突击队员同吃同住同劳动，带领社员一道战斗。
    上犹县以农林牧相结合做为改造低产田治标治本的根本办法。农，即在低产田广种绿肥，改良低产田土质；全县在低产田里播种了四万多亩绿肥作物，比往年增加三倍多。同时还斩除了山间杂草，普遍做到离田三丈无杂草，为山阴田增加了日照。林，即环山造林种牧草，既防止了水土流失和冲刷田地，也发展了林业，又为畜牧业提供了牧草。牧，即在低产田旁大办畜牧场，既为低产田常年积造大量的优质肥料，改造土壤，又发展了养猪，一举两得。
    水肥土三并重是上犹县改造低产田的另一治标治本办法。水，首先环山开沟，沿山筑堤，逢沟建坝，防止山洪毁田，并在排水沟中挖建沉沙池，使水中夹带的泥沙沉积下来不流入田中；其次，对水源不足的山排田，根据“蓄水为主、小型为主”的原则，修建山塘水库，保证农田用水；再就是开环田沟，把冷泉水排出田外，以及冬翻晒田，变冷浆泥为热浆泥。去冬今春，全县已为低产田开辟了五千多条排洪沟和三千多条水圳，新建山塘水库一千六百多个，今年将有效地全面控制山洪侵害，基本满足低产田的用水需要。肥，除了在低产田大办畜牧场、土化肥厂以及种植绿肥之外，还大力割青、铲草皮沤窖肥、堆肥，全县已沤制了六万五千多个粪窖，达到了亩田一窖、每窖百担肥。土，一是对沙田、浅脚田挑入“客土”，改变耕作层或增高耕作层；二是对泥脚深的冷浆田挑入硬质土；三是多犁多耙、细犁细耙，精耕巧做，达到土粒细小、地平如镜，便利作物生长。现在，所有低产田都已经过三次至四次细犁细耙，其中的一万多亩沙田都已挑入了“客土”，改变了耕作层。
    改造低产田是全县人民的一件大事，因此县委在改造低产田大军出发前，即组织了工业、商业等部门紧密配合支援，派人深入低产田区，帮助各公社建立工棚，选择猪场、化肥厂的地址，安装电话线路。随着先垦队的安营扎寨，商业部门派来了一百多副货郎担；医疗部门派来了十三个医疗大队；手工业部门派来了五百多名木、篾、铁工工人，为大军制造、修理工具。

    抓配种保满怀　抓保胎保全活山东开展
    畜牧生产突击月
    据新华社济南16日电　一个以大搞配种、保胎、孵化为主要内容的畜牧生产突击月运动正在山东各地展开。
    进入2月份以来，山东省各地都相继开展了突击旬、突击月，狠抓春季配种。到目前为止，全省九十九万头适龄母牛、母驴、母马，经过春配，再加上原来怀胎的，已有62．6％受孕怀胎。为了进一步开展大、小牲畜的春配、保胎和家禽孵化工作，中共山东省委13日晚召开了电话会议，号召全党全民从现在起到4月15日止，结合抗旱保麦抗旱春播中心任务，开展一个配种、保胎、孵化突击月运动。突击月运动的主要内容是：广泛开展两抓、两保、一孵（抓配种保满怀，抓保胎保全活、一户孵一窝家禽）活动，保证牲畜实现全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮，家禽春孵要完成全年任务的70％以上。大牲畜力争3月20日以前尽可能的多配，以便孕畜在今年生犊，这是保证今年大牲畜能否大跃进的第一关。猪、羊主要是继续推行重配、复配等经验，实现多胎高产和提高产仔量和成活率。
    为了使孕畜少流产和不流产，省委要求凡是孕畜需要减轻使役的，就坚决减轻使役；需要完全休息的，就坚决让它完全休息。同时，社社都要建立畜产院，所有孕畜在临产以前都要进畜产院，实行科学接生，专人管理。同时，要普遍建立幼畜场，使幼畜能做到全生全活全壮。
    省委还指出，各公社都要根据条件，建立一个适当规模的畜牧场，做好家畜家禽的配种、保胎、孵化和饲养管理的示范工作，并且把有些单位瘦弱一时无力养好的牲畜集中起来，养好管好，既减少牲畜瘦弱死亡，又做好复膘、复壮的示范工作。
    省委强调指出：加强党的领导是畜牧业高速度发展，实现今年畜牧生产继续跃进的根本保证。各地要下决心，把专职书记配备起来，要健全和加强畜牧业生产的专业机构，培养技术人员，壮大畜牧业队伍，大插红旗，大树标兵，组织社与社、场与场之间开展一个学、比、赶、帮的竞赛运动，使畜牧业生产运动一浪高一浪地持续大跃进。（附图片）
