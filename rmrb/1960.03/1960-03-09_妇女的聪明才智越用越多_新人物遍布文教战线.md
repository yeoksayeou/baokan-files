Xinhua News Agency Report: With the great development of cultural and educational undertakings, the cultural and educational outlook of working women in our country is rapidly changing. They are also in high spirits on the cultural and educational front, giving full play to their intelligence and talent.

The number of women in our country receiving formal education has increased unprecedentedly. In 1951, there were only 540,000 female students in universities, ordinary middle schools, and secondary vocational schools across the country. By 1959, this number had increased to more than 3.47 million. During this period, the number of female primary school students nationwide increased from more than 12 million to 35.6 million. Many outstanding working women who have emerged from various places are now receiving advanced studies in formal schools. They have all achieved excellent results on the road to climbing the peaks of science and culture.

At present, 120 million people in rural areas across the country are participating in literacy campaigns and receiving spare-time education, of which women account for about 40% to 60%. Working women in various places have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in the national upsurge of cultural learning. In the cultural learning competition in Dongwangzhuang People's Commune, Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, there were 310 "all-red families," 168 pairs of "model learning couples," 232 "model learning sisters-in-law," 198 "model learning sisters," and more than 70 "model learning mothers and daughters." The advanced collective "Thirty Ingenious Sisters Platoon" on the Huinü Reservoir construction site in Fujian Province, when they arrived at the construction site in July 1958, only one person could recognize a few characters. Because they persisted in cultural learning during their labor on the construction site, by the end of 1959, all of them had gotten rid of illiteracy and entered spare-time primary school. Now they can all write letters and read newspapers.

The ranks of female educators in our country are constantly expanding, and they have made outstanding achievements in the great leap forward of cultural and educational undertakings. There are more than 40,000 female educators in Shanghai, and female teachers account for 51.4% of primary school teachers in Beijing. They all work diligently like gardeners cultivating fresh flowers, and a large number of outstanding figures have emerged in recent years. Qi Shifang, a mathematics teacher at Beijing No. 4 Middle School, only stepped onto the educational work post in 1957. She tried every means to understand the situation of each student, not only taught the lessons well, but also patiently provided after-school help according to the characteristics of the students. Due to her excellent teaching performance, she has been selected as an advanced worker in the primary and secondary school education system in Xicheng District, Beijing. Li Jinglan, a primary school teacher in Lanzhou, and Sun Qiuhua, a primary school teacher in Qingdao, have achieved excellence rates of over 90% among their students. In the movement to eliminate illiteracy, a large number of outstanding female teachers in people's schools have also emerged. Zhang Yulan, a cultural teacher in a commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has traveled to 42 mountain villages throughout the management area in the past five years, going deep into every household, relying on the strength of the masses, and helping students persist in year-round learning. As a result, 95% of the young and middle-aged people have escaped illiteracy, and 104 people have been promoted to the senior primary class of spare-time schools.

Women have also made important contributions to science and technology, health, sports, and other work posts, and their ranks have grown significantly. What is particularly noteworthy is that a large number of female peasant scientists and various technical personnel have newly emerged in rural areas. There are 69 communes and more than 1,450 production teams in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region that have established scientific research institutes (stations) and experimental research groups, in which thousands of rural women are engaged in scientific research activities. According to statistics from eleven counties in this autonomous region, more than 80,000 Hui and Han women have been trained in the past year and have mastered certain agricultural science knowledge and production techniques. Zheng Xingzhen, a female agronomist from Changshi People's Commune in Dafang County, Guizhou Province, is now the director of a research station in the commune. She is bold and capable and created the "boiling water sterilization method," which eliminated corn and wheat smut disease and made great contributions to agricultural production. Last year, she and other members of the research station successfully manufactured ammonia water with peat. This year, she has also tried planting seven kinds of rapeseed and nearly ten kinds of wheat. These experiments are of great scientific value and have aroused great interest among the surrounding farmers.

Thanks to the Party's boundless care, all kinds of new female figures are emerging from the grassroots level on the cultural and educational front today, and they all have a high level of cultural education. The emergence of these new figures would have been unimaginable in the old society. Huang Meiying, a peasant woman from Shandan County, Gansu Province, who used to be illiterate, recently wrote an autobiographical novel of 10,000 words and a novel praising the people's commune. Cao Siying, a young female peasant in Jiangxi Province, wrote five scripts and 300 folk songs in three months and was called a female writer by the masses. Chong Xiuyun, a female peasant athlete from Jiangsu Province, won the women's shot put championship at the National Games last year. The emergence of these outstanding figures in all walks of life has aroused a huge response among the broad masses of working women, who have expressed their determination to establish lofty aspirations and ambitions and to learn from these advanced, educated working women.

    妇女的聪明才智越用越多
    新人物遍布文教战线
    据新华社讯　随着文化教育事业的大发展，我国劳动妇女的文化教育面貌正在迅速改变。她们在文教战线上也是意气风发，充分发挥自己的聪明才智。
    我国妇女受正规教育的人数有了空前增加。在1951年，全国高等学校、普通中学和中等专业学校的女学生还只有五十四万人，1959年已发展到三百四十七万多人，在这个时期内，全国小学女生人数由一千二百多万发展到三千五百六十万人。各地涌现出来的许多优秀的劳动妇女，今天在正规学校里得到了深造。她们在攀登科学文化高峰的道路上，都取得了优良的成绩。
    目前全国农村参加扫盲学习和受到业余教育的达到一亿二千万人，其中妇女约占40％到60％。各地劳动妇女在全民性文化学习高潮中，发挥了高度积极性。山东省平原县董王庄人民公社在文化学习竞赛中，出现了三百一十户“全家红”，一百六十八对“夫妻学习模范”，二百三十二名“妯娌学习模范”，一百九十八名“姐妹学习模范”，七十多名“母女学习模范”。福建省惠女水库工地上的先进集体“三十巧姐妹排”，1958年7月到工地时，只有一人能识几个字，由于她们在工地劳动中坚持文化学习，1959年底已全部摆脱文盲状态，进了业余小学，现在都会写信、读报了。
    我国女教育工作者的队伍在不断扩大，她们在文教事业大跃进中作出了卓越的成绩。上海市有四万多女教育工作者，北京市的小学女教师占51．4％。她们都像培植鲜花的园丁一样勤恳地工作，几年来涌现出大批优秀人物。北京市第四中学数学教师漆士芳，1957年才走出家庭踏上教育工作岗位，她千方百计地了解每个学生的情况，不但教好课，而且针对学生特点，耐心进行课余帮助。由于她教学成绩优良，已被选为北京市西城区中小学教育系统的先进工作者。兰州市小学教师李景兰，青岛市小学教师孙秋华，她们所教的学生，优等生都达到90％以上。在扫除文盲运动中，也出现了大批优秀的民校女教师。山西省昔阳县一位公社的文化教师张玉兰，五年来跑遍了全管理区四十二个山村，深入各家各户，依靠群众力量，帮助学员坚持常年学习，结果有95％的青壮年脱离文盲状态，有一百零四人升入了业余学校高小班。
    在科学技术、卫生、体育等工作岗位上，妇女们也作出了重要的贡献，而且队伍有了很大的发展。其中特别值得注意的是，在各地农村中新涌现出了一大批女农民科学家和各种技术人员。宁夏回族自治区有六十九个公社和一千四百五十多个生产队建立了科学研究所（站）和试验研究小组，其中有数千名农村妇女在进行科学研究活动。这个自治区根据十一个县的统计，一年来还培养了八万多名回族、汉族妇女，掌握了一定的农业科学知识和生产技术。贵州省大方县长石人民公社有一位女农艺师郑兴珍，现在担任公社一个研究站的站长，她敢想敢干，创造了“开水杀菌法”，消灭了玉米和小麦黑穗病，为农业生产作出了很大贡献。去年她同研究站的其他成员一起，用草炭制造氨水成功。今年，她又试种了七种油菜和近十种小麦。这些试验都很有科学价值，引起周围农民很大的兴趣。
    由于党的无限关怀，今天在文教战线上，正从基层涌现出各式各样的妇女新人物，她们都具有很高的文化教养，这些新人物的出现，在旧社会是不敢想像的。甘肃省山丹县有一位从前一字不识的农妇黄梅英，最近写成了一本一万字的自传体小说和一本歌颂人民公社的小说。江西省女青年农民曹嗣英，在三个月的时间内写出了五个剧本和三百首山歌，被群众称为女作家。江苏省一位女农民运动员崇秀云，去年在全国运动会上获得了女子铅球比赛冠军。各行各业这些优秀人物的出现，在广大劳动妇女中引起了巨大的反响，她们纷纷表示要树雄心，立大志，向这些先进的有文化的劳动妇女看齐。
