Nepal, I Salute You
Gao Lin
Respected guests from the Himalayan kingdom, please accept my heartfelt greetings and respect, and convey them to your beautiful snow-capped mountains and forests, to the whistling shepherds in the valleys and forests, to the handsome and brave Gurkha soldiers, and to the farmers busy planting and irrigating in the fields: we love the simple and warmhearted Nepalese brothers, who work hard and love truth and peace.

Thousands of years of history have cultivated our deep feelings, and we are connected in the river of culture. On the ancient and rugged mountain roads of the Himalayas, there are footprints of scholars, craftsmen, and Buddhists from both countries.

We admire Nepal's ocean-like culture, its magnificent architecture like a crystal palace in the sea. The five-story pagoda of Bhaktapur is enchanting, and the sonorous music and poetry are inspiring.

I love listening to the simple and ancient Nepalese mountain songs,
  The story of "Madan and Muna" is spread throughout the valley; (Note 1)
  Let me recite "The Caged Parrot" again; (Note 2)
  My eyes are filled with tears for "The Cold Hearth". (Note 3)

But I dedicate more respect to your patriotic people,
For hundreds of years, they have followed one another, leading the people in launching anti-colonialist
      struggles,
  Imprisoned in the dark and suffocating prisons of the Rana family,
  Their hearts burned with the torch of love for their country.

Ah, Nepal, you now hold high the banner of independence and peace,
  Standing tall on the southern slopes of the Himalayas.
More than eight million children resolutely oppose aggression and war,
  And will no longer be insulted and bullied in struggle.
On the road to peace, prosperity, and progress,
  The Chinese people are your good brothers.

Ah, distinguished guests from the Himalayan kingdom,
  Please accept my brotherly greetings and respect.

(Note 1): This folk song is well known in the Kathmandu Valley, and it describes the loyalty of young Madan and his lover Muna to their love.
(Note 2): This poem was written by the famous Nepalese modern poet Lekhnath Paudyalaya, describing his yearning for freedom when he was imprisoned by the Rana rulers. This poem is widely recited among young people in Nepal.
(Note 3): This is a famous poetic drama written by the Nepalese modern poet Sama, describing the love between Sandi, an "untouchable", and Gauri, the daughter of a wealthy man, but Gauri's father ordered his daughter to marry a wealthy old man. Gauri later died of depression, and Sandi mustered the courage to fight against the unequal class system of the old society.

    尼泊尔，我向你们致敬
    高林尊敬的喜马拉雅山国的客人，请接受我衷心的问候和敬意，把它转达给你们美丽的雪山和森林，带给山谷林间吹着口哨的牧童，告诉那英俊勇敢的廓尔卡士兵，还有田野上忙着播种灌溉的农民：我们热爱朴实热情的尼泊尔兄弟，他们辛勤劳动，酷爱人间真理与和平。千年的历史培育了我们深厚的感情，在文化的河流里我们脉脉相通。在喜马拉雅古老崎岖的山道上，布满两国学者、匠人、佛教徒的足印。我们爱慕尼泊尔深似海洋的文化，瑰丽的建筑像海中的水晶宫，巴特岗的五层高塔使人神迷，铿锵的音乐、诗歌激动人心。我爱听淳朴古老的尼泊尔山歌，
  “马丹和莫娜”的故事传遍山谷；（注一）让我再一次朗诵“笼中的鹦鹉”；（注二）我眼泪满眶，为了“冰冷的火炉”。（注三）但我把更多的敬意献给你们的爱国志士，百年来，他们前仆后继，领导人民掀起反殖民主
      义的斗争，
    囚禁在拉纳家族黑暗窒息的监狱，
    心里燃烧着热爱祖国的火炬。
    啊，尼泊尔，你如今举起独立、和平的旗帜，
    在喜马拉雅的南麓矗立。
    八百多万儿女坚决反对侵略和战争，
    斗争中不再受人侮辱和欺凌。
    在和平、繁荣、进步的大道上，
    中国人民是你们的好兄弟。
    啊，来自喜马拉雅山国的贵客，
    请接受我兄弟般的问候和敬意。
    （注一）：这首民歌在加德满都山谷家喻户晓，它描写青年马丹和他的爱人莫娜对于爱情的忠贞。
  （注二）：此诗是尼泊尔著名现代老诗人Lekhnath  Paudyalaya所作，描写他被拉纳统治者囚禁时渴望自由的心情。此诗在尼泊尔的青年中普遍传诵。
    （注三）：这是尼泊尔现代诗人萨马所著的著名诗剧，描写一位“不可接触者”桑迪同富人女儿葛丽相爱，但葛丽父亲命令把女儿嫁给了一位富有的老人，葛丽后来忧郁病死，桑迪鼓起勇气，决心同旧社会不平等的等级制度斗争。
