    Extensive Academic Exchange Activities in the Natural Sciences
    Recently, national academic exchange activities in the natural sciences have been widely carried out.
    From November of last year to the present, more than ten national specialized academic conferences in the natural sciences have already been held, including the National Electromechanical Cable Traction Machine Conference, the National Converter Lining Symposium, the Second National Pig Asthma Research Conference, the Atmospheric Circulation Academic Conference, the National Shipbuilding Technology Conference, the National Solid State Physics Academic Conference, the Annual Conference of the Chinese Textile Engineering Society, the National On-site Academic Conference on Railway Subgrade Collapse and Landslide Treatment, the National Oncology Academic Conference, the National Cardiovascular System Disease Academic Reporting Conference, the National Geographical Academic Conference, and the National On-site Conference on Pig Raising Tool Reform and Feed Production Experience Exchange. These meetings were jointly or separately convened by the relevant natural science specialized societies under the leadership of the Science and Technology Association of the People's Republic of China, and relevant departments. In addition, the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society, the Chinese Ceramic Society, the Chinese Psychological Society, and others have also combined to hold meetings and conduct academic exchange activities. Many other national academic conferences will also be held successively in the near future.
    These academic conferences are closely centered around many major issues in the current national economic construction. They have adopted various forms such as paper reports, group discussions, professional seminars, on-site visits, advanced experience introductions, technical demonstrations, and exhibitions to summarize, exchange, evaluate, and identify many colorful scientific and technological research results from the broad masses in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward. These conferences have played a positive role in promoting the development of national economic construction. For example, at the Electromechanical Cable Traction Machine Conference, the role and development prospects of cable traction machines were assessed, and eight (types of) electromechanical cable traction machines were recommended; at the Converter Lining Symposium, the goals and measures for further improving converter life and reducing lining material consumption were discussed, and a series of rapid and advanced operation methods were proposed; at the National Water Conservancy Science and Technology Discussion Conference, thirteen opinions reflecting the actual situation of current water conservancy construction and guiding the future direction of water conservancy technology development were put forward; at the Atmospheric Circulation Academic Conference, many research results on medium- and long-term weather forecasting were exchanged; and at the National On-site Conference on Pig Raising Tool Reform and Feed Production Experience Exchange, advanced experiences were exchanged, etc., all of which have important reference value for production departments. Through the exploration of these practical issues, the content of academic activities has also been greatly enriched. In terms of scientific theoretical development, the various conferences have also achieved great success.
    These academic conferences demonstrate a new look of mass-based natural science academic activities in our country under the leadership of the Party. The scale of each conference is very large. The number of participants is several times to even more than ten times that of previous conferences. The participating units are also very broad. The representative members include leading cadres at all levels, elderly and young scientists, local experts, and also practical workers. Through the academic exchanges conducted by the various conferences, it can be clearly seen that mass scientific and technological research activities in our country have achieved fruitful results. The number of papers, reports, and advanced experiences exchanged at the various conferences is large, wide-ranging, and of high quality. Each conference receives hundreds of papers and materials, most of which are summarized from the production practices of the broad masses and scientific research combined with reality. Some conference representatives reported that the papers have "three more": more collective creations, more works by young comrades, and more papers combined with the actual problems of current socialist construction. In addition, many disciplines with relatively weak foundations in the past and emerging cutting-edge disciplines have presented papers and reports at these recent conferences. For example, the papers received at the National Solid State Physics Academic Conference include semiconductors, solid-state luminescence, crystallography, magnetism, and other aspects; many of the papers at the National Geographical Academic Conference come from many new disciplines and fields such as chemical geography, lakes, estuaries, coasts, microclimates, and engineering geomorphology. The level of these papers, reports, and advanced experiences is relatively high. For example, a preliminary analysis of the more than 300 papers received at the National Geographical Academic Conference showed that about 70% of them were of a high level. Among them, the report on the experience of water and soil conservation work in Dajiashan, Jilin Province, by Dai Xilu, a farmer water and soil conservation expert from Jilin Province, and the report on the experience of desert control work in Yulin Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, by Cui Fengming, a farmer desert control expert from Shaanxi Province, were unanimously praised. Many of the advanced experiences exchanged at the annual conference of the Chinese Textile Engineering Society have directional significance for the development of the textile industry; the rapid weaving method demonstrated on-site by worker representative Wang Zhengquan greatly inspired many engineering and technical personnel in terms of improving theory.

    自然科学界广泛开展学术交流活动
    最近以来，全国性的自然科学学术交流活动，广泛开展。
    从去年11月份以来，到目前为止，已经举行的全国性自然科学专门学术会议，就有全国机电绳索牵引机会议，全国转炉炉衬座谈会，全国第二次猪气喘病研究工作会议，大气环流学术会议，全国造船技术会议，全国固体物理学术会议，中国纺织工程学会年会，全国铁道整治路基坍方滑坡现场学术会议，全国肿瘤学术会议，全国心脏血管系统疾病学术报告会，全国地理学术会议，全国养猪工具改革和饲料生产经验交流现场会议等十余个。这些会议是由中华人民共和国科学技术协会领导下的各有关的自然科学专门学会，与有关部门联合召开或单独召开的。另外，中国机械工程学会、中国硅酸盐学会、中国心理学会等等，也结合召开了会议，进行了学术交流活动。还有许多全国性的学术会议，最近也将陆续举行。
    这些学术会议，都紧密地围绕着当前国民经济建设中的许多重大问题，采取了论文报告、小组讨论、专业座谈、现场参观、先进经验介绍、技术表演、展览等多种形式，把几年来，特别是大跃进以来许多来自广大群众的、丰富多彩的科学技术研究成果，加以总结交流、评价鉴定。这些会议对促进国民经济建设事业的发展，起了良好的作用。例如在机电绳索牵引机会议上，对绳索牵引机的作用和发展前景做了估价，并且推荐了八台（种）机电绳索牵引机；在转炉炉衬座谈会上讨论了进一步提高转炉炉龄，降低炉衬材料消耗的目标和措施，提出了一系列快速先进操作法；在全国水利科学技术讨论会上，提出了反映当前水利建设实际情况和指导今后水利技术发展方向的十三项意见；在大气环流学术会议上交流了许多中、长期天气预报的研究结果；在全国养猪工具改革、饲料生产经验交流现场会议上交流了先进经验等等，这些对生产部门都有重要参考价值。通过对这些有实际意义问题的探讨，也大大丰富了学术活动的内容。在科学的理论发展方面，各次会议也取得了很大成就。
    这些学术会议，显示了在党的领导下，我国群众性自然科学学术活动的崭新面貌。各次会议的规模都很大。参加活动的人数，比历届会议多几倍以至十几倍。参加的单位也非常广泛，代表成员中，有各级领导干部，有老年和青年科学家，有土专家，也有实际工作者。通过各次会议所进行的学术交流，可以清楚地看出：我国群众性的科学技术研究活动，已经取得了丰硕的成果。各次会议所交流的论文、报告、先进经验，数量多、方面广、质量也高。每次会议收到的论文资料多达数百篇，这些成果绝大多数是从广大群众的生产实践和结合实际的科学研究中总结出来的。有的会议代表反映论文有“三多”：集体创造的多，青年同志作品多，结合当前社会主义建设实际问题多。此外，还有许多过去基础比较薄弱的学科和新兴的尖端学科，在最近的这些会议上，提出了论文和报告。例如，全国固体物理学术会议收到的论文，包括半导体、固体发光、晶体学、磁学等等方面；全国地理学术会议的论文，很多是来自化学地理、湖泊、河口、海岸、小气候、工程地貌等等许多新的学科和领域的。这些论文、报告和先进经验的水平是较高的。例如全国地理学术会议对所收到的三百多篇论文进行了初步分析，认为具有较高水平的约占70％以上，其中有吉林省的农民水土保持专家戴喜禄，关于吉林大架山水土保持工作经验的报告，陕西省的农民治沙专家崔凤鸣，关于陕西榆林专区治沙工作经验的报告，受到大家一致推崇。在中国纺织工程学会年会上所交流的先进经验，很多项在纺织工业的发展上，是具有方向性意义的；工人代表王正铨实地表演的快速织布法，使很多工程技术人员感到对提高理论有重大启发。
