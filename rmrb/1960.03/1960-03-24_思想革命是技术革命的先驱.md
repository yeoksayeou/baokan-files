    Ideological Revolution is the Pioneer of Technological Revolution
    The Shashi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The Process of Technological Revolution is Also a Process of Ideological Revolution
    Beginning in late November of last year, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, our city launched a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. This movement, in our city, is only just beginning, but it has provided us with profound education and enlightenment. Technological revolution is not only a revolution in technology, but also a revolution in thought and habit. The transformation of production tools leads to a series of changes in operational techniques, labor organization, and enterprise management; because people have different levels of understanding of this revolution, and different degrees of ideological preparation, they will inevitably reflect different viewpoints and different attitudes towards this revolution. These different viewpoints and attitudes are reflections of the ideological struggle between the new and the old, the struggle between the advanced and the conservative, and also the struggle between two lines. In the early stages of the movement, what was reflected was that some leading cadres did not see the characteristics of the current revolutionary situation and did not believe in the wisdom of the masses, which was a mechanical equilibrium viewpoint of not daring to thoroughly reform old technologies and fearing chaos; after the masses actively mobilized, they became all kinds of "conditionalists"; they were afraid of difficulties, retreated in the face of difficulties, and lacked enthusiasm for the large number of new things that emerged in the movement. These comrades lacked a dialectical and developmental viewpoint, demanding that new things be perfect as soon as they appeared. When the movement achieved some results, some people became complacent and did not stand at the forefront of the movement to lead the masses in continuous leaps forward. The struggle between two ideologies and two lines runs through the entire technological revolution movement. If new ideas do not defeat old ideas, advanced ideas do not defeat conservative ideas, and the line of more, faster, better, and more economical does not defeat the line of less, slower, worse, and more expensive, it will not be possible to mobilize the broad masses to participate in this movement, and the technological revolution will lack a reliable mass base and guarantee. Therefore, the technological revolution must first use ideological revolution as its driving force. The process of technological revolution itself is a process of ideological revolution, a process of continuously improving everyone's ideological level.
    Speaking Extensively about the Situation and Launching Extensive Debates
    In the early stages of the movement, when people lacked ideological preparation to greet this technological revolution, we extensively discussed the current situation based on Chairman Mao's principle of "poverty gives rise to the desire for change." We successively sent several groups of responsible cadres and innovation experts to visit advanced areas, and after returning, we spoke extensively about the leap forward situation across the country, especially the revolutionary spirit on the agricultural front. Through extensive discussions about the situation, under the encouragement and inspiration of revolutionary spirit examples from advanced areas, the broad masses of cadres and people consciously launched a mass self-education movement of linking thoughts, linking reality, everyone talking about change, constantly talking about change, and everything talking about "change." Many masses successively formulated their own innovation plans. At this time, although many people realized that the situation was changing rapidly and that they should adapt accordingly, they had various different attitudes towards "change." Some people were determined to change, and to change greatly, quickly, and thoroughly; some people believed that they could only change a little, only change gradually, not change greatly or quickly; they could only proceed step by step and not develop by leaps and bounds. They were actually afraid that the mass movement would disrupt the so-called "normal order." Some individuals also said, "Change means unrest," "Great change leads to great chaos, small change leads to small chaos, and the more you change, the more chaotic it becomes." We then, in response to this situation, launched a nationwide debate, with the topic "Will Shashi change? Great change or small change? Fundamental change or reformist change? Who will we rely on to change? What methods will we use to change?" to mobilize the masses to link their thoughts and link reality. In order to organize the actions of change produced by the masses after ideological education, we formulated plans to support agricultural technological transformation, plans to change the face of the city, and plans to advance towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. And according to the above-mentioned struggle tasks, adopting the method of clarifying goals and fighting in stages, we put forward the combat task of the first battle, which is to combine with the key to production and advance towards heavy manual labor. As soon as this task was put forward, in just over ten days, the city eliminated 381 processes of heavy manual labor. Chairman Mao's principle of "poverty gives rise to the desire for change" armed the masses, inspired the masses, and guaranteed the victory of the first battle.
    When people did not know what methods to use to change, we put forward the slogan "Change like Ma Xueli (an innovation expert from Hubei Province)," and at the same time held high the Shashi's Ma Xueli-style innovation red flag, Fang Lieying. Fang Lieying is a young female worker in a knitting factory, only twenty years old, who sews the toe of socks. In order to improve labor productivity and get rid of backward production technology, she diligently studied and struggled against various conservative ideas. In the first battle, she realized the "four automatics" of the sock toe seaming machine (winding yarn, joining heads, cutting heads, and removing socks), greatly reducing manual operation and improving labor productivity. The daily output of the sock toe seaming machine increased from more than 40 dozen to more than 60 dozen, and the number of workers operating the machines was reduced by one-third. Fang Lieying's approach of innovating tools, improving labor productivity, and getting rid of heavy and cumbersome manual labor pointed out a specific direction for the broad masses of manual workers. Inspired by Fang Lieying, the second battle, focusing on manual operations, was immediately launched. Carpenters, shoemakers, bamboo weavers... innovation and creation blossomed everywhere, and the teams reporting good news to the Party continued to pour in. This movement expanded from the production sector to the commercial sector, service industries, and even cultural education and scientific research departments, showing a lively scene of everyone using their brains and everyone making innovations.
    Continuous Improvement of Ideology and Continuous Deepening of the Movement
    The large number of new things that appeared made the broad masses of people and cadres extremely excited. However, some people, due to insufficient ideological preparation, or lack of a dialectical viewpoint, or strong habitual forces, lacked enthusiasm for new things. In order to unify ideological understanding and promote the technological revolution forward, we organized a study movement of Chairman Mao's discussion on "how to correctly treat new things." Chairman Mao's analysis of new things and his attitude of wholeheartedly treating new things pointed out the direction for the broad masses of workers and cadres.
    Through study, the broad masses of workers understood that new things are invincible; the growth of new things can only be realized through serious struggle with difficulties; and the progress of work is the process of new things defeating old things. Many cadres and workers consciously checked their attitude towards new things, and praised the thousands of people who dared to create and enthusiastically supported new things. From then on, advanced workers became more conscious and more determined, the knots of backward workers were untied, and a large-scale, magnificent, and all-participating mass movement to transform manual operation into mechanization and semi-mechanization was launched fiercely in many industries. Carpenters used machines they made themselves to replace the axes, planes, saws, and chisels passed down from Lu Ban for thousands of years; shoemakers used self-made indigenous machines to replace knives, awls, and scissors; cafeteria staff used indigenous methods to make steam stoves, vegetable cutting machines, and rice washing machines, replacing heavy manual labor. Commercial staff made automatic oil, wine, and rice vending machines. Therefore, workers wrote thousands of words of poems to praise Chairman Mao. Workers from the Second Machinery Factory wrote:
    The growth of new things needs the sun,
    The growth of a baby needs the nourishment of its mother.
    Chairman Mao's thought is the sun,
    Chairman Mao's works are nutrition.
    When the third battle ended, some comrades became complacent and said, "Everything that could be innovated has been innovated, and further innovation would require buying foreign machines," "I have thrown away the planes and axes that I have used for decades, and now you want another revolution, what is there to revolutionize?" In order to unify ideology on a new basis, overcome complacency, and greet a new upsurge in the technological revolution, we organized the broad masses of workers to study Chairman Mao's thought on continuous revolution. On the one hand, the broad masses of workers used Chairman Mao's spirit of continuous revolution and the grand ambitions of socialist construction to examine and summarize their work; on the other hand, they organized workers to visit advanced areas and learn, and launched a movement to learn from the advanced levels in the country. As a result, complacency was dispelled. The broad masses of workers were inspired by the grand ambitions of socialist construction and determined to carry the technological revolution through to the end, with everyone striving to be a promoter of the technological revolution. Based on this ideological movement, the fourth battle, advancing towards mechanization, continuity, and automation, was organized. In this battle, inspired by the spirit of continuous revolution, the broad masses of workers produced 33 automatic production lines and 72 assembly lines in just over ten days.
    Conducting Large-Scale Study Movements to Improve Theoretical Level
    Our city's technological revolution has always been driven by ideological revolution, and guided by studying Chairman Mao's works to guide our current practical struggle. Therefore, studying Chairman Mao's works has become the demand of the broad masses of workers, with more than 29,000 people participating in the study throughout the city, and more than 1,800 study groups of Chairman Mao's works established; During this period, more than 60,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works (including some reference books) were sold, forming a wave of learning. In the process of learning, we have always paid attention to closely combining the study of Chairman Mao's works with the current ideological and production struggle practice. In this regard, we have the following experiences:
    First, Chairman Mao's works are so rich, from what aspects should we start learning? Our experience is to determine the learning content based on the principle of theory guiding practice, and to decide the learning content based on the urgent demands of the masses. We must be good at proposing the main ideological contradictions of the masses in a certain period, and this main ideological contradiction often reflects the main contradictions in the struggle of real life. Therefore, the learning content must be closely combined with the current practical struggle tasks. Raise the learning topics from real life, and use Chairman Mao's theories on these issues as weapons to analyze and solve the problems in the practical struggle. Through learning, promote the struggle forward. In this way, step by step, we can learn Chairman Mao's works from low to high and from shallow to deep, and firm up the proletarian world outlook.
    Second, starting from the actual ideological situation to study Chairman Mao's works not only embodies the policy of linking theory with practice, but also makes it easier for workers to learn and understand Chairman Mao's works and apply them vividly.
    When studying Chairman Mao's works, many workers are most interested in examples such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire", "The Direction of 500 Million Peasants", and "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky". They said, "The technological revolution we are engaged in now seems difficult and indigenous, but it can go from indigenous to foreign, and eventually to mechanization and automation." Many workers compared new things to children walking, they will stumble at the beginning, and slowly they will walk with the support of their parents. Inspired and guided by Chairman Mao's idea of actively supporting new things, thousands of technological innovations that had been shelved in the past (generally stopped due to difficulties) were re-proposed for testing, and a large number of technological innovations and technological revolution proposals emerged, forming an upsurge in the technological revolution.
    Third, organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works must be led by the Secretary, the whole Party must act, and launch a large-scale mass movement.
    Because we closely linked ideology, work, and study together, the movement to study Chairman Mao's works has become a driving force for promoting production and various tasks. For this primary task on the ideological front, our Party committees at all levels were led by the First Secretary and grasped by the whole Party. The Municipal Party Committee and the grassroots Party organizations all established study leading groups and lecture groups led by the Secretary. In addition to analyzing the ideological trends of the masses and determining the key points of study based on the current struggle, the Municipal Party Committee also made demonstration reports in light of the ideological situation, linked to reality, and helped the masses to study; at the same time, it selected and edited Chairman Mao's works and articles by other responsible comrades of the Central Committee on Chairman Mao's works, People's Daily editorials, and compiled study materials for workers to study.
    Because the work of training backbones is a reliable guarantee for the sustained development of the mass movement of theoretical study, after determining the study content based on the superior's study arrangements and the actual situation of our city, we first organized cadres above the county level and cadres at the level of Party branch secretaries to study, helping these comrades understand the principles of the documents, link them with ideological reality, and check their work, and then organized these comrades to widely make guidance reports to the masses to help workers study. The second backbone team is to cultivate the theoretical study backbone of the workers. Each branch organized some older workers and cadres with higher awareness as the central group. In addition to studying by question, the central group studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction", "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and documents such as the historical experience of one and two discussions on the dictatorship of the proletariat, according to the actual situation. In addition to the backbone study organized by the branch, we ran short-term rotational training classes for workers to study theory at the Municipal Party School, one week per class. In the first phase, we organized 50 workers (mainly old workers with more than ten years of work experience) to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice", and the effect was very good. The workers reflected that the more they studied, the brighter they became. The improvement of the ideological level of these backbones helped the broad masses of workers better combine theory with practice and elevate practical problems to theory. We also organized workers who studied well, had deep experiences, could use theory to analyze and explain practical problems, and could elevate practice to theory to form a "Lecture Group for Studying Mao Zedong's Works" to report to the masses of workers, so that everyone had a living example of how to study Mao Zedong's works, broke the superstition that "studying theory is a matter for cadres, and workers with low education cannot learn well," and further promoted the upsurge in learning.

    思想革命是技术革命的先驱
    中共沙市市委员会
    技术革命的过程也是思想革命的过程
    从去年11月下旬起，我们市在省委、地委领导下，掀起了一个以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动。这个运动，在我们市来说，还仅仅是开始，但对我们的教育和启示是很深刻的。技术革命不仅是技术上的革命，而且也是思想上、习惯上的革命。生产工具的变革，引起操作技术、劳动组织、企业管理等一系列的变革；由于人们对这一革命的认识程度不同，以及思想准备的程度不同，而对待这个革命必然反映出不同的观点和不同的态度。这种不同的观点和态度就是新与旧的思想斗争的反映，先进与保守斗争的反映，也是两条路线斗争的反映。在运动开展的初期，反映出来的是部分领导干部看不到当前革命形势的特点，不相信群众的智慧，是一种不敢彻底变革旧技术和怕乱的机械平衡论观点；在群众积极行动起来以后，又成了形形色色的“条件论”者；他们害怕困难，知难而退，对待运动中涌现出的大量新生事物缺乏热情。这些同志缺乏辩证的发展的观点，要求新事物一出现就完美无缺。运动取得某些成绩的时候，有些人就出现满足现状，不是站在运动的前面，领导群众不断跃进。两种思想、两条路线的斗争贯彻技术革命运动的始终。新的思想不战胜旧的思想，先进的思想不战胜保守思想，多快好省的路线不战胜少慢差费的路线，就不能动员广大群众参加到这个运动中来，技术革命就缺乏可靠的群众基础和保障。因此，技术革命首先必须以思想革命作为动力。技术革命过程本身就是思想革命的过程，是不断提高大家思想水平的过程。
    大讲形势开展大辩论
    运动初期，当人们对迎接这场技术革命的大风暴还缺乏思想准备的时候，我们根据毛主席“穷则思变”的原理，大讲当前形势。我们接连派出数批负责干部和革新能手到先进地区去参观，回来后大讲全国各地一日千里的跃进形势，特别是农业战线上的革命精神。通过大讲形势，广大干部和群众在先进地区的革命精神范例的鼓舞和启示下，自觉地掀起了一个联系思想，联系实际，人人谈变，时时谈变，事事谈“变”的群众性的自我教育运动。许多群众都纷纷制订自己的革新计划。在这个时候，虽然许多人意识到了形势在飞跃地变，自己也应当相适应地变，但是对“变”却有各种不同的态度。一种人是坚决要变，而且要大变、快变、彻底地变；一种人认为只能小变，只能逐渐地变，不能大变、很快地变；只能循序渐进，不能飞跃发展。他们实际上是害怕群众运动打乱了所谓“正常秩序”。也有个别人说：“变就是不太平”，“大变大乱，小变小乱，越变越乱”。我们又针对这种情况，以“沙市变不变？大变还是小变？根本性的变或是改良性的变？依靠谁变？用什么方法变？”为题，发动群众联系思想，联系实际，开展全民性的大辩论。为了把群众经过思想教育后产生的变革行动组织起来，我们制定了支援农业技术改造的规划、改变城市面貌的规划和向机械化半机械化进军的规划。并根据上述斗争任务，采取明确目标、分步作战的方法，提出了第一战役的战斗任务，这就是结合生产关键，向笨重体力劳动进军。这个任务一提出，在短短的十多天里，全市消灭笨重体力劳动工序三百八十一道。毛主席“穷则思变”的原理武装了群众，鼓舞了群众，保证了第一战役的胜利。
    当人们还不知道用什么方法变的时候，我们提出“像马学礼（湖北省革新能手）一样变”的口号，同时高举沙市的马学礼式的革新红旗方烈英。方烈英是个年纪才二十岁的针织厂青年缝尖值车女工。她为了提高劳动生产率，摆脱落后的生产技术，勤钻苦学，并与各种保守思想作斗争，在第一战役中实现了缝尖机的“四自动”（挽纱、接头、割头、下袜），大大减少了手工操作，提高了劳动生产率，缝尖机由原来日产四十余打上升到六十余打，而值车工人减少了三分之一。方烈英采取革新工具，提高劳动生产率，摆脱笨重繁琐的手工劳动的道路，给广大手工工人指出了具体方向。在方烈英的启发下，立即又开展了以主攻手工操作为主的第二战役。木工们、制鞋工人们、篾工们……革新创造四处开花，向党报捷的队伍源源不断。这个运动由生产部门扩展到商业部门，服务行业以至文化教育、科学研究部门，出现了人人动脑筋，人人闹革新的生动局面。
    思想不断提高运动不断深入
    新生事物的大量出现，广大群众和干部都是异常兴奋的。但是也有人因思想准备不足，或缺乏辩证观点，或有浓厚的习惯势力，对新鲜事物缺乏热情。为了统一思想认识，促进技术革命向前发展，我们组织了一个学习毛主席论述“如何正确对待新生事物”的学习运动。毛主席对新生事物的分析和满腔热情地对待新生事物的态度，给广大工人和干部指出了方向。
    通过学习，广大职工懂得了新生事物是不可战胜的；新生事物的成长是和困难作严重斗争才能实现的；工作的进步就是新事物战胜旧事物的过程。许多干部和工人自觉的检查了自己对待新生事物的态度，表扬了成千上万的勇于创造并热情支持新生事物的人。从此先进的工人更加自觉、更加坚定了，后进的工人疙瘩解开了，一个规模壮阔、气势磅礴，人人参加革新，人人支持革新的变手工操作为机械化半机械化的群众运动，在许多行业猛烈的开展起来。木工们用自己制造的机械代替了千年鲁班相传的斧、刨、锯、凿；制鞋工人自造土机械代替了刀子、锥子、剪子；食堂工作人员用土法制成了蒸汽灶、切菜机、淘米机，代替了繁重的体力劳动。商业工作人员制作了自动售油、售酒、售米器。因此，工人们写下了千言万语的诗篇来歌颂毛主席。机械二厂工人写道：
    新生事物成长需要太阳，
    婴儿的成长需要母亲的哺养。
    毛主席的思想就是太阳，
    毛主席的著作就是营养。
    当第三战役结束后，有部分同志产生了自满情绪，说，“能革的都革掉了，再革就得买洋机器”，“我用了几十年的刨子、斧头都丢了，还要革命，革什么呢？”为了在新的基础上统一思想，克服自满，迎接新的技术革命高潮，我们组织了广大职工学习了毛主席的不断革命论的思想。一方面广大职工用毛主席不断革命的理论精神，社会主义建设的雄心大志，检查、总结了自己的工作；另一方面，组织职工到先进地区参观学习，开展向全国先进水平看齐的运动。因之，自满情绪打消了。广大职工为社会主义建设的雄心大志所鼓舞，决心把技术革命进行到底，人人争做一个技术革命的促进派。在这个思想运动的基础上，组织了向机械化、连续化、自动化进军的第四战役。在这个战役里，广大职工受了不断革命精神的鼓舞，在短短十多天里，制成了三十三条生产自动线，七十二条生产流水线。
    大搞学习运动提高理论水平
    我市技术革命始终以思想革命为动力，以学习毛主席著作指导我们当前实际斗争，因而学习毛主席著作成为广大工人群众的要求，全市参加学习的有两万九千多人，成立了一千八百多个学习毛主席著作小组；这一时期销售毛主席著作六万余册（包括一部分参考书），形成了学习热潮。我们在学习过程中，始终注意把学习毛主席著作与当前思想和生产斗争实践紧密结合起来。这方面，我们有以下几点体会：
    第一，毛主席著作是那样丰富，从什么方面学起。我们的体会是根据理论指导实践的原则来确定学习内容，根据群众的迫切要求来决定学习内容，要善于提出一定时期群众的主要思想矛盾，而这个主要思想矛盾，常常反映了现实生活斗争中的主要矛盾。因此学习内容必须和当前实际斗争任务紧密结合，从实际生活中提出学习的课题，以毛主席有关这些问题的理论作为武器，去分析和解决实际斗争中的问题，通过学习，促进斗争向前发展。这样循序渐进，就能由低到高，由浅入深地学习毛主席著作，坚定无产阶级的世界观。
    第二，从实际思想状况出发学习毛主席著作，一方面体现了理论联系实际的方针；同时这样也最便于工人学习和领会毛主席著作，并可以生动地加以运用。
    很多工人在学习毛主席的著作时，对“愚公移山”、“星星之火，可以燎原”、“五亿农民的方向”、“谁说鸡毛不能上天”等事例最感兴趣。他们说：“我们现在搞的技术革命，看起来是困难的，而且是土的，但是可以由土到洋，将来还会到机械化和自动化”。许多工人比喻新生事物和小孩子走路一样，开始是要跌跤的，慢慢地经过父母的扶持就会走了。由于毛主席积极支持新生事物的思想的启发和指导，有成千上万件过去被搁置的技术革新（一般都是遇到困难而停止使用的）又被重新提出来试验，同时还出现了大量的技术革新和技术革命的建议，形成了技术革命的高潮。
    第三，组织群众学习毛主席著作，必须书记挂帅，全党动手，大搞群众运动。
    由于把思想、工作和学习紧密地联系起来，学习毛主席著作的运动已成为推动生产和各项工作的动力，对思想战线上的这一项首要工作，我们各级党委都是第一书记挂帅，全党动手抓的。市委和基层党组织都以书记为首成立了学习领导小组和讲师团。市委除根据当前斗争，分析群众思想倾向确定学习要点外，并针对思想状况，联系实际，作示范报告，帮助群众学习；同时选辑毛主席著作和中央其他负责同志论述毛主席著作的文章、人民日报社论、编印学习材料给工人学习。
    由于训练骨干的工作是理论学习的群众运动持续发展的可靠保证，我们根据上级学习部署和本市实际情况确定学习内容后，首先组织县以上干部和支部书记一级干部学习，帮助这些同志理解文件原理，联系思想实际，检查工作，然后组织这些同志广泛向群众作辅导报告，帮助工人学习。第二个骨干队伍是培养工人的理论学习骨干。各支部都组织了部分觉悟较高的老工人和干部为中心组。中心组除按问题学习外，根据实际情况学习毛主席的“矛盾论”，“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和一论、再论无产阶级专政的历史经验等文件。除支部组织的骨干学习外，我们在市委党校办了工人学理论的短期轮训班，每班一星期。第一期，我们组织了五十名工人（主要是有十年工龄以上的老工人），学习了毛主席的“实践论”，效果很好，工人反映，越学习心里越亮堂。这些骨干思想水平的提高，就帮助了广大工人把理论与实际更好的结合起来，把实际问题上升到理论。我们还组织学习好、体会深的，能用理论分析说明实际问题并能把实际上升到理论的工人组成“学习毛泽东著作讲演团”，向工人群众作报告，使大家对怎样学习毛泽东著作有了活的榜样，破除了“学理论是干部的事，工人文化低学不好”的迷信思想，进一步促进了学习热潮。
