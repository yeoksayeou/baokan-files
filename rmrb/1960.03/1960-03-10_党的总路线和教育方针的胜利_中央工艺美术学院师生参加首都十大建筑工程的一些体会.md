The Victory of the Party's General Line and Education Policy
——Some Experiences of Teachers and Students of the Central Academy of Arts and Design Participating in the Capital's Ten Great Construction Projects
Zhang Ding
    Through rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, and labor training, the teachers and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Design have combined with the workers and peasants, made progress in their political thinking, and raised their communist consciousness. Especially since the implementation of the education revolution in 1958, after a great debate on the education policy, political and ideological education has been strengthened, the Party's leadership has been established, and teaching work has been reformed.
    At this time, in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the capital was preparing to build ten major buildings. When the teachers and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Design heard that they would have the opportunity to participate in this work, everyone was overjoyed, and the whole academy was buzzing with excitement. Now, most of these magnificent buildings have been completed. This is the product of the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward.
    However, there were difficulties in welcoming this great and arduous task. First, the task was important, the deadline for completing the task was short, and there were many work items. Second, in terms of subjective conditions, the school had been established for less than three years, the teachers lacked practical work experience, and most did not have professional knowledge. After research by the Party Committee, it was recognized that this was a great and glorious political task, the best way to combine education with practice, and through this work, the Party's education policy could be fully embodied. Therefore, it was decided to accept this glorious task as the best gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.
    At the end of 1958, seventy-five teachers and students from the undergraduate and training classes were organized as the basic team to go to the construction site to work. The teachers and students who stayed at school to attend classes served as support. According to work needs, teachers and students from different majors such as interior decoration, murals, ceramics, and dyeing and weaving were divided into groups to participate in the art design work of construction units such as the Great Hall of the People, the Museum of the Revolution, the Palace of Nationalities, and the Military Museum.
    After three months of intense design work, the teachers and students went to the Jingdezhen Ceramic Factory, the Beijing Northeast Gypsum Factory, and the Iron Factory to participate in the National Day project physical labor. Around National Day, some teachers and students turned to internal furnishings design work. In terms of architectural decoration, it has received good reviews both domestically and internationally. In terms of ceramic design, according to users and artists, it exceeded the level of the National Day ceramics in 1954. The textile design and the technological innovation of the production unit were also combined, which also exceeded the current product level and created many new varieties. In general, many of the designs that were adopted greatly exceeded the graduation level of the former Department of Arts and Crafts. Leading comrades and the people gave us a lot of encouragement.
    However, in the entire process of this work, not everything went smoothly. From the beginning to the end, the struggle between the two roads and two methods ran through. The Party Committee of the Academy, under the leadership of the higher-level Party, adhered to the Party's leadership and upheld putting politics in command, which successfully completed this arduous political task and achieved a triple harvest of work, ideology, and teaching. It fully proved the greatness and correctness of the spirit of the Party's General Line and education policy in art education.

    I
    Adhering to the Party's leadership and upholding putting politics in command are the guarantees for achieving victory in work.
    At the beginning of the work, a struggle between two roads and two methods unfolded. One was that individual leading cadres of the academy emphasized that participating in the work of the Ten Great Buildings would affect teaching, disrupt normal order, and make it difficult to guarantee teaching quality. This right-leaning conservative thought was wrong and was criticized at the time. Another opinion emphasized that we should completely obey the needs of the work, believing that such arduous and intense work could not be combined with teaching, and the work itself was learning. It should take a hands-off approach, which actually lacked a correct understanding of combining education with practice and lacked confidence in the realization of the Party's education policy, attempting to replace systematic theoretical education with artistic practice and neglecting the leading role of the Party, reflecting the bourgeois pragmatic education thought.
    In the Party meeting, a debate was held to clarify that participating in this work was the most direct service to proletarian politics, and it was also the most vivid and concrete education to improve political and artistic thinking. The Party must lead, ideology must come first, politics must be in command, and Red must lead the way in expertise. Work should be combined with teaching, and teaching should help work. The professional knowledge learned by various departments should be combined as much as possible. According to the specific situation, the work should be incorporated into the plan, the teaching plan should be revised, and the necessary professional knowledge education and art theory education should be inserted according to the unevenness of the work. In this way, because of the needs of the work, students absorbed theoretical knowledge quickly and were immediately tested in practice. On the one hand, the quality and efficiency of the work were greatly improved, and the work itself stimulated the students' enthusiasm for learning. At the same time, it also overcame the shortcomings of teachers who had been detached from reality and only talked on paper in the past, and greatly improved their professional level.
    In the design work of various majors, in each stage of the work, there were struggles between two roads and two methods. Whether to walk on two legs or one leg had to be debated before it could be resolved. The contradiction between work and teaching was the center of the debate at the beginning. After that, there were contradictions between the fast and good of artistic quality, between work and rest in work, and between the expert line and the mass line in creative methods. The Party organized discussions in a timely manner to improve ideological understanding and enable the work to continue to leap forward.

    II
    We must implement the Party's literary and artistic policy in artistic practice and plant the red flag in professional work.
    During the anti-Rightist struggle and in the education revolution, although general criticisms were made of bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts, they were not deep enough. Some people still believed that the Party's leadership of artistic work could only be reflected from political requirements, and the Party did not have to intervene in artistic issues. They separated politics from art. In this work, we used practical work to refute this view, always adhered to the Party's literary and artistic policy, and planted the red flag in professional work. In each stage of the work, we resolutely implemented the Party's instructions, instead of taking the bourgeois expert line.
    In art education and practice, how to implement the Party's literary and artistic policy, through this participation in the National Day Ten Great Buildings work, constantly unfolded the struggle between two roads. In previous political movements, the political standards in art were relatively clear in the minds of teachers and students, but as soon as artistic standards were involved, there were great differences. The "Chinese style and Chinese spirit that the Chinese people love to see" proposed by Chairman Mao is also our artistic standard, but in the minds of some people, this is still abstract. Without struggle, the red flag cannot be raised.
    In the art design work of the Ten Great Buildings, the first thing was to struggle against bourgeois national nihilism. The bourgeois structuralism and functionalism in architecture and technology, and the opposition to national style in art, were criticized. At the same time, the bourgeois restorationism, valuing the ancient and despising the modern, clinging to the old and sticking to conventions, only looking backward and not forward, and opposing innovation and other erroneous thoughts, were also criticized.
    The principles of practicality, economy, and aesthetics pointed out by the Party in terms of arts and crafts design were not clear in the minds of some arts and crafts education cadres who had been detached from reality for a long time. When they were designing, they often proceeded from personal interests or adhered to tradition (Chinese tradition or Western tradition), forgetting that they should first consider the political effect, and personal style must be unified with the overall style, and must be unified with the style of the times and the communist style.
    In terms of political standards and artistic standards, many leading comrades gave many principled instructions at various stages of the work, giving us weapons in the struggle between the two roads, and closely combining the criticism of bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts with the current work.
    For example: the overall style of the Great Hall of the People requires the newest and most beautiful, to have the vigor of the rising sun of the country, to express the spirit of the 600 million people, to be simple and generous, to give people an optimistic and happy infection, to break the idea of seeing things but not people in design, and not to give the feeling of being pressed on the people's heads like ancient buildings, because socialist architectural art serves the broad masses of the people. In terms of form, neither Western nor ancient, we must use both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. For example, the requirements for the Ten Thousand People Auditorium should also break the frame of the theater stage, so that the stage and the audience are integrated, creating a feeling of the sea and the sky. A huge red star is designed in the center of the roof, surrounded by stars, showing the Party's leadership is brilliant and illuminates all directions.
    For example, the initial style of the lighting design was an improved palace lantern form, and later it was attempted to adopt a chandelier form. The former is the Chinese tradition, and the latter is the Western tradition. Both started from tradition, but failed to innovate and give people a clear sense of the times. After repeated discussions, I didn't know what to do. Finally, the Party proposed that it would be enlightening to start from the use, and the problem was solved.
    The initial design of architectural decoration was also extremely complex and cumbersome. After the leading comrades pointed out that it should be simple and bright, and should not be made into the palace style of the old era. In this way, it not only overcame the shortcomings of the traditional decorative patterns being cumbersome and the heavy and low atmosphere of the temples, but also absorbed the advantages of its rigorous structure. According to the healthy and bright color tone required by the Great Hall of the People, appropriate arrangements and treatments were made.
    Other designs, such as ceramic design and textile design, were also designed based on the actual needs of each unit, studying the laws of national traditional art, and referring to Western science and technology, and they also achieved pushing out the old and bringing forth the new.
    Especially the young teachers and students, under the leadership of the Party, took Red as the lead in expertise, and their artistic thinking was also broadened. They studied the rules and laws of ancient excellent patterns, developed and developed them, and strived to create new forms, and composed various kinds of craft patterns with new content and new themes in modern life. For example, steel, grain, cotton, coal, etc. are composed of new eight treasures, replacing the old eight treasures on religious patterns such as wheels, screws, umbrellas, and covers. Many patterns symbolizing revolution, symbolizing peace, and symbolizing industrial and agricultural production that could never be found in architectural technology in the past feudal era were created and widely used in architectural decoration and interior crafts, forming a new situation in arts and crafts design where a hundred flowers bloom and push out the old and bring forth the new.

    III
    Implement the spirit of the General Line, adhere to the Party's education policy, and achieve a triple harvest of teaching, work, and ideology.
    At the beginning of the work, both teachers and students had some superstitious ideas. Teachers superstitious in the West, superstitious in tradition, superstitious in classroom teaching as the only method, worrying that they would not be able to complete the task and disrupt the teaching plan. And the students had not participated in actual design work, let alone such a huge project. Most of the students could not understand the design drawings at first, and did not understand the size and proportion. Under the correct leadership of the Party, they seriously discussed the Party's instructions and requirements, repeatedly emphasized the great significance of education serving proletarian politics and education being combined with labor production, liberated their minds, broke superstitions, despised difficulties strategically, valued difficulties tactically, mobilized the masses, and put forward the three combinations of teachers, students, and users under the leadership of the Party; and the five combinations of teachers, students, users, construction units, and skilled workers; taking the mass line, and adopting various methods according to the nature of different work.
    Some architectural decoration designs were proposed by architects, written by students, or designed by teachers, and students acted as assistants; or the users put forward requirements, and the students drew a large number of sketches for collective discussion and evaluation. Some important designs have been revised countless times, including the opinions of leaders, as well as the opinions of users, architects, teachers, students, workers, and the general public. Finally, it cannot be determined which design came out of it, so it is called: the design of the whole people.
    In the process of work, various social surveys were conducted. Teachers and students who participated in architectural decoration design visited important buildings in Beijing, summarized experiences, and learned lessons; students who participated in ceramic design went to the Beijing Hotel to ask the restaurant section chief to make a report, solicited the opinions of the service staff, visited the tableware used at banquets, understood its specifications and styles, and studied the details of how to use and clean it; the students who designed carpets also learned a lot of practical experience from artists with rich design experience.
    In order to master the traditional artistic laws, we also went to the Forbidden City to study the ceramic shapes and decorations of the past dynasties. In order to learn from foreign countries, we also studied a large number of modern fabrics from Democratic Germany and modern lamps from Czechoslovakia.
    In the process of work, experts from society and teachers from our college were also invited to give academic reports, and discussions were conducted in conjunction with the work.
    Under the circumstances of the mutual combination, mutual penetration, and mutual promotion of work and teaching, and the vigorous development of mass movements, not only the routines of design work were broken, but also the routines of teaching were broken.
    In terms of work, we have achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results. The number of drawings completed in less than three months is: 500 for the Great Hall of the People (excluding sketches); 80 for the Museum of the Revolution; 400 for ceramic originals; and 400 for dyeing and weaving.
    Taking the textile design group as an example, the average design per person exceeded the achievements of the past semester in terms of quantity. The adoption rate is very large, which is incomparable to closed-door teaching.
    The gains in teaching can be summarized as:
    First of all, in professional design, due to the combination of reality, there is an overall concept. In the past, the design of a column head gypsum flower, or a carpet, or a curtain was considered in isolation, and the overall artistic effect could not be obtained. In fact, there are great differences in the effect of the two-dimensional design on the design drawings and the three-dimensional effect, the small sample and the large sample, the long distance and the short distance. The size of the pattern ratio and the nature of the material (coarse stone, fine stone, metal and colored glaze) are also closely related.
    The design of a gypsum flower must consider the contradiction between acoustics and optics. The design of a lamp must consider the distribution of light, and so on. In terms of architectural construction, questions are raised from different angles. If these contradictions are not unified, a complete artistic design cannot be made. Especially when participating in labor in factories, not only the purpose of ideological exercise is achieved, but also professional production knowledge is obtained; for example, students who go to iron factories see that a line on the iron lamps they designed is dispensable, and they can draw it in one minute, but it takes a skilled worker a day to process it together. After he came back, he said that he must be very serious and careful in future designs. ——These are things that cannot be learned in the classroom.
    Secondly, basic course knowledge and professional knowledge have been consolidated and improved. Some students have learned basic patterns in the lower grades in the past, but the impression is not deep. After combining with practice, a column head lace has to repeatedly draw dozens of continuous patterns; a fan louver has to repeatedly draw dozens of different styles of suitable patterns. This kind of work consolidates the learning of basic patterns.
    Students who study ceramics, for the design of blue and white tableware, have copied dozens of articles from the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and are very familiar with its pattern organization rules, and can even recite them. Students who study dyeing and weaving design carpets for the Palace of Nationalities, because each museum has to use different national patterns, through work, they have mastered the different rules of each national pattern, and everyone can recite many sets of traditional carpet patterns, and can draw them when they pick them up. Therefore, professional knowledge has been greatly improved.
    Finally, the biggest gain is ideological.
    After the completion of the work, the teachers and students fully recognized the huge political influence of arts and crafts, and affirmed that art education must implement the spirit of the General Line, adhere to the Party's education policy, and take the mass line. The students' professional thoughts were consolidated, and they realized that their major was closely related to the socialist construction of the motherland, and understood that their work was directly serving socialism. In the past, some students looked down on arts and crafts, thinking that they did not have the political influence of painting, and there was no fame or profit, and they yearned for the Academy of Fine Arts, wanting to be a painter or sculptor. Through work, they realized that arts and crafts are an indispensable part of the socialist construction of the motherland, and like other arts, can give the people a huge influence on thoughts and feelings, thus clarifying the significance of their studies and the importance of their tasks, enhancing their political sense of responsibility, and loving their major more.
    All the teachers and students of the college unanimously felt that through participating in the National Day project, they achieved a triple harvest of teaching, work, and ideology. This is the great victory of the Party's General Line and education policy.

    党的总路线和教育方针的胜利
    ——中央工艺美术学院师生参加首都十大建筑工程的一些体会
    张仃
    中央工艺美术学院师生，经过整风、反右派斗争和劳动锻炼，和工农群众相结合，在政治思想方面有了进步，共产主义觉悟提高了。特别是1958年实行教育革命以来，经过了对教育方针的大辩论，政治思想教育加强了，党的领导确立了，教学工作有了改革。
    正当这个时候，为了庆祝伟大的祖国建国十周年，首都准备兴建十大建筑。中央工艺美术学院师生听到能有机会参加这一工作的时候，个个兴高采烈，全院情绪沸腾。现在，这些规模宏伟的建筑，大部分已经完成。这是党的总路线、大跃进的产物。
    但迎接这一伟大艰巨工作，不是没有困难的。首先是任务重大，要求完成任务的期限短暂，工作项目繁多；其次是在主观条件方面，学校成立不到三年，教师实际工作经验不足，多数还没有专业知识。经过党委研究，认识到这是一项伟大的光荣的政治任务，是教育和实际相结合的最好方法，通过这一工作能全面的体现党的教育方针，因此，决心接受这一光荣任务作为建国十周年最好的献礼。
    在1958年底，组织了本科和训练班的七十五名师生，作为基本队伍，开赴工地工作。留校上课的师生，作为后援。根据工作需要，由室内装饰、壁画、陶瓷、染织等不同专业师生，分组参加人民大会堂、革命历史博物馆、民族宫、军事博物馆、迎宾馆等建筑单位的美术设计工作。
    经过了三个月的紧张设计工作以后，师生又下到景德镇陶瓷厂、北京东北石膏厂、铁工厂，参加国庆工程体力劳动。在国庆前后，部分师生又转入内部陈设设计工作。在建筑装饰方面得到国内国际的好评。在陶瓷设计方面，据使用单位和美术家们反映，超过了1954年建国瓷水平。织物设计和生产单位技术革新相结合，也超过了当前的产品水平，并创造了不少新品种。总的说来，许多被采用的设计，大大超过了从前工艺美术系的毕业水平。领导同志和人民群众，给了我们很多鼓励。
    但是，在这整个工作的过程中，并不是都一帆风顺的。从开始到结束，都贯穿着两条道路、两种方法的斗争，本院党委在上级党的领导下，坚持了党的领导，坚持了政治挂帅，才胜利地完成了这个艰巨的政治任务，并达到了工作、思想、教学三丰收，充分地证明了艺术教育必须贯彻党的总路线精神和教育方针的伟大和正确。
    一
    坚持党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是取得工作胜利的保证。
    在工作一开始，就展开了两条道路两种方法的斗争。一种是本院个别领导干部，强调参加十大建筑的工作，会影响教学，打乱正常秩序，教学质量难于保证。这种右倾保守思想是错误的，在当时就遭到了批判。另一种意见，强调应该完全服从工作需要，认为像这样艰巨紧张的工作不能结合教学，工作本身就是学习；应该采取大撒手的态度，实际上是对教育结合实际，缺乏正确认识，对于党的教育方针的实现，缺乏信心，企图以艺术实践代替系统的理论教育，忽视党的领导作用，反映了资产阶级实用主义的教育思想。
    在党的会议上，进行了辩论，明确了参加这一工作，就是最直接地为无产阶级政治服务，而且也是一次提高政治思想和艺术思想的最生动最具体的教育。党一定要领导，思想先行，政治挂帅，以红带专，工作结合教学，以教学帮助工作，尽量结合各系科所学的专业，根据具体情况，把工作纳入计划，修订教学计划，根据工作忙闲不平衡的情况，插入必要的专业知识教育和艺术理论教育。这样，因为工作需要，学生吸收理论知识很快，并立即在实践中受到考验。一方面大大提高了工作质量和工作效率，工作本身又反转来刺激学生的学习热情，同时也克服了教师们过去脱离实际、纸上谈兵的缺点，大大提高了业务水平。
    在各种专业的设计工作中，在工作的各个阶段中，都有两条道路、两种方法的斗争，两条腿走路或一条腿走路，都要经过争论才能得到解决。工作和教学的矛盾，一开始就是争论的中心，此后又发生了艺术质量的快和好的矛盾，工作中劳逸的矛盾，在创作方法上，专家路线和群众路线的矛盾，对这些问题党都及时组织讨论，提高思想认识，使工作继续跃进。
     二
     必须在艺术实践中贯彻党的文艺方针，把红旗插到业务上去。
    在反右派斗争时，在教育革命中，对资产阶级文艺思想，虽然进行了一般的批判，但还不够深入。还有一些人认为，党领导艺术工作，只能从政治要求上来体现，在艺术问题上，党可以不必过问。他们把政治性和艺术性割裂开来。在这次工作中，我们用实际工作反驳了这种观点，一直坚持了党的文艺方针，把红旗插到业务上去，在工作的每个阶段，都坚决贯彻了党的指示，而不是走资产阶级的专家路线。
    在艺术教育和实践中，如何贯彻党的文艺方针，通过这次参加国庆十大建筑工作，不断地展开了两条道路的斗争。在历次的政治运动中，艺术上的政治标准，在师生思想里是比较明确了，但一涉及艺术标准，就又有了很大的分歧。毛主席所提出的“中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”，也就是我们的艺术标准，但在某些人的思想上这还是抽象的。不经过斗争，红旗就树不起来。
    在十大建筑的美术设计工作上，首先是对资产阶级民族虚无主义作斗争。对资产阶级在建筑和工艺上的结构主义、功能主义，反对艺术上的民族风格，进行了批判。同时对资产阶级的复古主义，厚古薄今，抱残守缺，墨守成规，只向后看，不向前看，反对革新等等错误思想，也进行了批判。
    党在工艺美术设计方面所指出的实用、经济、美观的原则，过去在某些长期脱离实际的工艺美术教育干部的思想上，是并不明确的。他们在进行设计的时候，往往从个人兴趣出发，或拘泥于传统（中国的传统或西洋的传统），忘记了首先应该考虑政治效果，个人风格必须统一于整体风格之中，必须统一于时代风格与共产主义风格之中。
    在政治标准和艺术标准方面，许多领导同志在工作的各个阶段，都给了很多原则性的指示，使我们在两条道路的斗争中，有了武器，把对资产阶级文艺思想的批判，和当前的工作紧密地结合起来。
    例如：对人民大会堂的整体风格，要求最新最美，要有国家旭日东升的朝气，要表现六亿人民的气魄，要朴素、大方，要给人以乐观愉快的感染，要破除设计上的见物不见人的思想，不能像古代的建筑物那样给以压在人民头上的感觉，因为社会主义的建筑艺术是为广大人民服务的。形式上，不要洋也不要古，要古今中外皆为我用。又如对万人礼堂的要求，也要打破剧院舞台的框子，使台上台下融合起来，要造成海阔天空的感觉，屋顶中央设计一个巨大的红星，周围是满天星斗，表现党的领导光芒万丈，普照四方。
    又如灯具设计，最初式样是改良的宫灯形式，后来又企图采用吊灯形式。前者是中国的传统，后者是西洋的传统，都是从传统出发，而不能推陈出新给人以鲜明的时代感。经过反复讨论，莫知所从，最后党提出从使用出发才豁然开朗，解决了问题。
    建筑装饰的最初设计，也极为复杂繁琐。经过领导同志指出，要简洁明快，不要搞成旧时代的宫殿式的。这样就既克服了传统装饰花纹繁琐的缺点和庙堂沉重低压的气氛，但又吸取了它的结构严整的长处。根据人民大会堂所要求的健康明朗的色调，作了妥善的安排和处理。
    其他的如陶瓷器设计、染织品设计等，也都根据各单位的实际需要，研究了民族传统艺术的规律，参考了西洋的科学技术进行设计，也都做到了推陈出新。
    尤其是青年教师和同学们，在党的领导下，以红带专，艺术思想也开阔起来，研究古代优秀图案的法则规律，加以发挥发展，努力创造新的形式，把现代生活中的新内容新题材，组成各式各样的工艺图案。例如把钢、粮、棉、煤等组成新八宝，代替轮、螺、伞、盖等宗教图案上的旧八宝。把象征革命、象征和平、象征工农业生产的许多在过去封建时代的建筑工艺里决找不到的图案，都创作出来了，广泛地运用到建筑装饰上和室内工艺品上，形成了工艺美术设计百花齐放推陈出新的新局面。
    三
    贯彻总路线精神，坚持党的教育方针，达到教学、工作、思想三丰收。
    工作开始的时候，教师和同学都有一些迷信思想。教师迷信西洋，迷信传统，迷信课堂教学是唯一的方法，担心既完不成任务，又打乱了教学计划。而同学们也没有参加过实际设计工作，更不用说这么巨大的工程了。多数同学，最初连设计图纸都看不懂，尺寸比例也不明白。在党的正确领导下，认真地讨论了党的指示和要求，反复强调教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育要与劳动生产相结合的伟大意义，解放思想、破除迷信，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，发动群众，并提出了在党领导下，教师、同学、使用单位三结合；以及教师、同学、使用单位、施工单位、技工师傅的五结合等方针；走群众路线，根据不同工作的性质，采取了各种各样的方法。
    有的建筑装饰设计，由建筑师提出设计意图，由同学执笔，或由教师设计，同学作助手；或由使用单位提出要求，由同学绘出大量草图，集体来进行讨论评定。有些重要设计，经过无数次修改，其中有领导人意见，也有使用单位、建筑师、教师、学生、工人以及一般群众的意见，最后不能确定是哪一个设计出来的，所以称之为：全民设计。
    在工作过程中，进行了各种社会调查。参加建筑装饰设计的师生，参观北京重要建筑物，总结经验，接受教训；参加陶瓷设计的同学，到北京饭店请餐厅科长作报告，征求服务员的意见，参观了宴会上使用餐具的情况，了解它的规格式样，研究如何使用、清洁等细节；设计地毯的同学，也向有丰富设计经验的艺人，学习了许多实际经验。
    为了掌握传统的艺术规律，我们还到故宫研究历代陶瓷造型和装饰。为了向外国借鉴，又研究了大批的民主德国的近代织物，和捷克斯洛伐克的近代灯具等。
    在工作过程中，还请社会上的专家和本院教师作学术报告，并结合工作进行讨论。
    在工作与教学互相结合，互相渗透，互相推动，大搞群众运动的情况下，不仅打破了设计工作的常规，也打破了教学上的常规。
    在工作上，作到了多快好省，不到三个月的时间完成图纸数量是：人大会堂五百张（不包括草图）；革命历史博物馆八十张；陶瓷正稿四百张；染织四百张。
    以染织品设计小组为例，每人平均设计，在数量上超过过去一个学期的成绩。采用率很大，决不是关门教学可比得了的。
    在教学上的收获，总括起来是：
    首先，在专业设计上，由于结合实际，有了整体观念，过去设计一块柱头石膏花，或一块地毯，一块窗帘布，都是孤立地考虑，不能求得艺术上的整体效果，实际上在设计图纸上的平面设计与立体效果，小样与大样，远距离与近距离，效果上是有很大不同的。设计花纹比例大小和材料性质（粗石、细石、金属和琉璃），也有密切关系。
    一块石膏花设计，要考虑到和声学光学上的矛盾。一个灯具设计，要考虑光的分布等等。在建筑施工方面，从各个不同的角度提出问题，这些矛盾不统一起来，就不能作出完整的艺术设计。尤其是到工厂参加劳动，既达到思想锻炼的目的，又获得了专业生产知识；譬如下铁工厂的同学，看到自己设计的铁灯具，可有可无的一条线，自己用一分钟画出来的，但和一个技工一起加工却要花费一天的劳动，他回来后表示，今后设计必须要十分严肃认真才行。——这些都是在教室中所学不到的东西。
    其次，基础课知识和专业知识都得到了巩固和提高。有些同学的基础图案，过去在低年级是学过的，但印象不深，经过结合实际，一个柱头花边，要反复画几十种连续图案；一个风篦子，也要反复画几十种不同式样的适合图案，这样工作，使基础图案的学习得到巩固。
    学陶瓷的同学，为了青花餐具的设计，把明清的青花瓷，摹写了几十篇，对它的花纹组织规律，已经十分熟悉，甚至可以背出来了。学染织的同学，给民族宫设计地毯，因为每个馆要采用不同的民族图案，通过工作，掌握了各民族图案的不同规律，对于地毯的传统图案，每人都能背出很多套，可以拿起来就画。所以专业知识，得到很大的提高。
    最后，最大的收获，是思想上的收获。
    工作完成以后，师生们充分地认识了工艺美术的政治影响的巨大，并肯定艺术教育必须贯彻总路线的精神，坚持党的教育方针，走群众路线。同学们的专业思想巩固了，体会到自己所学的专业，和祖国社会主义建设是密切相关的，理解到自己的工作，是直接为社会主义服务。过去有些同学看不起工艺美术，觉得没有绘画的政治影响大，又无名无利，一心向往美术学院，要当一个画家或雕刻家。通过工作，认识到工艺美术是祖国社会主义建设中不可缺少的一部分，不仅给人民以物质上的需要和满足，也像其它艺术一样，能给人民以思想感情上的巨大影响，因而，明确了自己学习的意义和任务的重大，增强了政治责任感，对专业也更加热爱了。
    全院师生一致感到，通过参加国庆工程工作，达到了教学、工作、思想三丰收。这是党的总路线和教育方针的伟大胜利。
