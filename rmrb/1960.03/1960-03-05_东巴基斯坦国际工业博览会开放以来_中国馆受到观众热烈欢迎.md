    东巴基斯坦国际工业博览会开放以来
    中国馆受到观众热烈欢迎
    据新华社达卡电　东巴基斯坦国际工业博览会中的中国展览馆自开放以来受到热烈欢迎。在二十天中，前来参观的已有四十万人左右。
    达卡一共只有六十万左右的人口。自从中国馆向公众开放以来，每天挤满了参观者，特别是在星期日，参观者平均有四、五万人。许多参观者来自东巴基斯坦的吉大港等城市和乡村，甚至还有来自西巴基斯坦的卡拉奇和拉合尔的。
    已有四千多位参观者在留言簿上写下了参观中国馆的观感和热烈赞扬中国人民的话。
    中国馆的开幕式是由东巴基斯坦省长扎基尔·侯赛因在2月9日主持的。
    中国曾在1952年和1955年参加在卡拉奇举行的国际工业博览会。这是中国展览馆第一次在达卡展出。
