　　Powerful Educational Tool

　　Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, China's scientific education film and news documentary film industries have also made great strides and developed rapidly. In the past two years, nearly three thousand films of science education and news documentaries have been produced nationwide, equivalent to the total of the past eight years. More importantly, the ideological content and artistic skills of these films have been greatly improved, playing a huge role in publicizing the Party's policies, promoting advanced experiences, educating the people, and popularizing cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge. They are powerful tools for publicizing the Party's policies and educating the people. Therefore, they have been well received by the audience, who call news cinemas "amateur universities," "political classrooms," and "technical schools."

　　"Amateur universities," "political classrooms," and "technical schools" are the fundamental purpose of socialist film art. Film cannot be regarded as a mere entertainment tool, and cinemas cannot be regarded as mere entertainment venues. Film is an important part of the cultural and artistic cause. Although it has an entertainment function, its more important role is to educate the people. The bourgeois film, which is adapted to the bourgeois society's political economy, is entirely regarded as an entertainment tool, full of low taste and toxins. Its purpose is to deceive the people and paralyze the people's fighting spirit. Our film, on the other hand, is adapted to the socialist political economy. It stirs up the people's enthusiasm for building socialism and fighting for a better life. During our spare time, watching a good film can provide us with many inspirations and knowledge. In the past two years, the science education films and news documentaries produced in China have, to varying degrees, achieved this goal.

　　At present, China's political and economic situation is developing rapidly. New people and new things are constantly emerging, providing film workers with inexhaustible materials. We should summon greater efforts and better play the role of "amateur universities," "political classrooms," and "technical schools."

    有力的教育工具
    在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东文艺思想的指导下，我国的科学教育电影和新闻纪录电影事业，也迈开大步，一日千里地发展起来。两年来，全国出产的科学教育片和新闻纪录片近三千本，相当于过去八年的总和。更重要的是，这些片子的思想内容和艺术技巧都有了很大提高，在宣传党的政策、推广先进经验、教育人民群众，以及普及文化科学技术知识方面，都发挥了巨大作用，是宣传党的政策和教育人民的有力工具。因此，获得了观众的好评，他们把新闻电影院叫作“业余大学”、“政治课堂”和“技术学校”。
    “业余大学”、“政治课堂”和“技术学校”，是社会主义电影艺术事业的根本目的。不能把电影看作单纯的娱乐工具，把电影院看作单纯的娱乐场所。电影是文化艺术事业的一个重要组成部分，虽然它有娱乐的作用，但更重要的是教育人民。资产阶级的电影，和资产阶级社会的政治经济相适应，完全当作娱乐的工具，充满了低级趣味和毒素。其目的就是要欺骗人民，麻痹人民的斗志。而我们的电影，则和社会主义的政治经济相适应，它鼓起人民建设社会主义的热情，为美好生活而斗争。我们在工作余暇，去看一场好的电影，可以得到许多启发和知识。两年来，我国出产的科学教育电影和新闻纪录电影片子，都在不同程度上达到了这一目的。
    目前，我国的政治形势和经济形势，都在飞快地向前发展。新人新事不断出现，这给电影工作者提供了取之不尽，用之不竭的题材。我们应当鼓起更大的干劲，更好地发挥“业余大学”、“政治课堂”和“技术学校”的作用。
