Comrades and Friends! Dear Comrades!

Today, women from all walks of life in our capital, together with people from all sectors of society, are gathered here in a grand meeting to warmly celebrate the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day. We are most honored to have the presence of the leaders of the Party Central Committee and the State. We are honored to have invited representatives from the Women's International Democratic Federation, women representatives from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, Hungary, and other countries, women representatives from Japan, as well as the wives of ambassadors to China from various countries, female experts and wives of experts from various countries assisting in our country's construction, to celebrate this glorious festival with us. Their presence adds more splendor to our meeting. On behalf of the women of China, and on behalf of the presidium of the meeting, I extend my heartfelt welcome to the distinguished guests from various countries, and express my warm congratulations to all the friends and comrades present.

With the continuous victories of the proletarian revolution, national liberation, and the people's democratic movement, the women's liberation movement has also developed unprecedentedly vigorously.

Fifty years ago, the Second International Socialist Women's Conference held in Copenhagen, based on the proposal of Clara Zetkin, the advanced fighter of the proletariat and outstanding leader of the world women's movement, decided that March 8th would be International Working Women's Day. From that day on, the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day became a festival for working women all over the world to unite and strive for liberation. As we commemorate this great festival, we must first inherit and carry forward Clara Zetkin's revolutionary spirit of being loyal to the cause of proletarian liberation and the cause of women's liberation. Clara Zetkin devoted her life to fighting for the interests of the working people. In order to defend the purity of Marxism, she waged an irreconcilable struggle against the revisionism of the Second International. She loved peace and resolutely opposed imperialist and colonial wars. She steadfastly defended the interests of working women and devoted her life to the struggle for women's liberation.

We are very pleased to see that with the continuous victories of the proletarian revolution, national liberation, and the people's democratic movement, the women's liberation movement has also developed unprecedentedly vigorously. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution in Russia opened a new era in human history; after the Second World War, many socialist countries were established in Europe and Asia; thus, the women of these countries were liberated, truly became masters of the country like men, and made greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist and communist construction. In the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the vast number of women actively participated in the struggle to win and safeguard national independence and their own rights. In other capitalist countries, the struggle for the rights of women and children has also made significant progress. In the worldwide movement to defend peace, the broad masses of women have played an increasingly significant role, and have increasingly become an important force in striving for peace and opposing the imperialist war policy. With this rapid development of the women's liberation movement, the international solidarity of women around the world has also been strengthened. We believe that in this era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the women's liberation movement, as an important component of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, will surely achieve greater victories.

Under the illumination of the General Line, driven by the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, China's women's movement has entered a new stage of realizing complete liberation since 1958.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have found and adhered to the three magic weapons of the general line for socialist construction, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Communes, enabling our country's socialist construction to achieve a sustained leap forward with both high speed and proportional development. The main targets of our country's Second Five-Year Plan have been completed three years ahead of schedule. Our people are full of confidence and are striving hard to build our country, in the not too distant future, into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Under the illumination of the general line for socialist construction, driven by the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, our country's women's movement has entered a new stage of realizing the complete liberation of women since 1958. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of urban and rural women have universally and enthusiastically participated in social labor. Almost all women with labor ability in the countryside have participated in various labors of the People's Communes, becoming a main force in agricultural production. A large number of family members of workers and urban residents have also actively participated in social labor. The ranks of female workers across the country have expanded rapidly, reaching more than 8 million by the end of 1959, an increase of about 5 million compared with 1957, and more than twelve times that before liberation. In particular, the laborers in street industries are mostly women, who started from scratch, set up factories on their own, and engaged in production on a large scale, playing a positive role in promoting the development of urban local industries. Women across the country, whether in industrial and agricultural production, or in culture, education, science, technology, health, sports, and other aspects, have made tremendous contributions. On all fronts of socialist construction in our country, women have deeply experienced the supreme glory and joy of labor. Whether in factories or in the fields, women enthusiastically sing the praises of labor. They have sung such a song: "Who sings the most mountain songs on the hillside? The girls sing several baskets in one breath, singing to the gate of the Chang'e Palace, singing until the Weaver Girl stops her shuttle, everyone says that heaven is not worth loving, they want to go to the commune to work, commune life is so happy, sisters laugh cheerfully." Many folk songs of this kind fully express the unparalleled joy and pride of the new Chinese women in labor. Their feelings are in stark contrast to the feelings of women in capitalist societies who are forced to engage in slave labor. This shows how ridiculous and foolish it is for imperialist elements to slander our country for practicing "forced labor"!

Adapting to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production and the participation of women in social labor, the socialization of housework is being universally realized in urban and rural areas of our country. Collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings have been widely established and are moving towards consolidation and sound development. From the mountains to the plains, from the countryside to the cities, there are public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly everywhere, and collective living habits have been widely established. Taking Beijing as an example, there are more than 12,000 public canteens, more than 1,200 service and repair organizations, and more than 18,000 nurseries and kindergartens, accommodating more than 610,000 children. In the suburbs, 92.4% of farmers have joined public canteens, liberating more than 250,000 female laborers to participate in production. Nearly 200,000 housewives in urban areas have participated in social labor. Like Beijing, collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings throughout the country have developed and improved rapidly, which guarantees that women can participate in labor with peace of mind and vigorously promotes the development of production undertakings.

As a result of the participation of the broad masses of women in social labor and collective life under the leadership of the Party, not only has it promoted the transformation and progress of society, but it has also promoted the transformation and progress of women themselves. The broad masses of women in our country have become glorious social laborers with both a high degree of socialist consciousness and a certain level of technical and cultural knowledge. They are energetic, high-spirited, and have broken the sense of inferiority left over from thousands of years, showing the heroic spirit of being able to do anything and do anything well. They have carried forward the spirit of communism, learning from the advanced, helping the backward, stepping forward in the face of difficulties, and giving way for convenience. The practice of being selfless and helping others has become a common practice among women. Women in the industrial and commercial sectors are also striving to transform themselves, and many have also participated in social labor, taking a big step forward on the road from being exploiters to being laborers. The status of women in society has been greatly improved, the feudal patriarchal system has been completely broken, and new democratic and harmonious families have been widely established.

In labor and production, millions of advanced women's collectives and advanced individuals have emerged, spread throughout rural areas, cities, and various fronts, truly with models in rows and red flags like forests. Today, many representatives of advanced women and advanced collectives attended our meeting. This is something we should be proud and honored of.

In order to consolidate and develop our achievements, women across the country must strive to study theory, culture, science, and actively participate in the technological revolution movement, and vigorously run collective life welfare undertakings and service undertakings.

The great achievements of the women's movement in our country are the result of the hard work and heroic struggle of the broad masses of women and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong. In order to consolidate and develop our achievements, women across the country must, together with the people of the whole country, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the three magic weapons for developing socialist construction, and strive to achieve a sustained leap forward and a better leap forward. To this end, we put forward the following four tasks to women across the country:

First, women across the country must enthusiastically participate in the movement to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, and further improve their political awareness and ideological and theoretical level.

From their own personal experience, the people of our country have deeply realized that Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth, and Mao Zedong Thought is an example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao Zedong creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism, guided us to achieve the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution, and is now guiding us to continue to carry out the Socialist Revolution in depth and develop socialist construction at high speed. In the future, he will surely guide us to achieve greater victories on the socialist road and advance victoriously towards communism in the future.

Now, a wave of enthusiasm for studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works has been formed among the people, and many women have enthusiastically and actively participated in this study. Through this study, we will surely more firmly establish the proletarian worldview, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, adhere to the Party's correct line, and wage a resolute struggle against right-wing opportunism and modern revisionism. Through this study, we will always maintain a strong revolutionary will, give full play to the spirit of continuous revolution, and advance bravely along the road pointed out by the Party. Our study movement has not been long, and women across the country should more universally join this movement, practicing and learning at the same time, studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and using this great thought to arm our minds, so as to make greater contributions to socialist construction.

Second, women across the country must continue to exert great efforts and enthusiastically participate in the increase production and practice economy movement called for by the Party, which is centered on technological innovation and technological revolution.

Women who have labor ability but have not participated in labor should consciously participate in social labor according to the needs of the country. Women who have already participated in social labor should actively participate in technological innovation and technological revolution, bravely engage in the mass movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. This movement is an important key to developing socialist construction at high speed, improving labor efficiency, and reducing physical labor, and it is also an urgent requirement of the broad masses of the people and women in our country. We must further emancipate our minds, break superstitions, continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and popularize this revolutionary movement to all fronts and corners. In modern large enterprises, we must strive to carry out the mass movement of automation and semi-automation. We must make a huge change in the technological face of our country's production in all aspects, so that our country's productivity can develop at a higher speed.

Third, vigorously run collective life welfare undertakings and service undertakings, further realize the socialization of housework, and transform scattered, tedious, and ignorant housework into a collective socialist economic undertaking.

The great revolutionary teacher Lenin once said: "Only where the petty housework is transformed universally into large-scale socialist economy is there true emancipation of women, is there true communism." Women in our country deeply realize the brilliance and correctness of Lenin's teaching from their own experience. Realizing the socialization of housework and organizing collective life can not only fully liberate labor, promote the high-speed development of socialist production, but also cultivate people's communist spirit, establish new relations of friendship and unity between people; it also makes family life more democratic, harmonious, and happy, and allows children to receive better social education and become new people of communism. Therefore, we must strive to make the collective way of life gradually become the main way of life.

We must develop towards comprehensive organization of collective life on the basis of the socialization of major housework. Women across the country must pool their efforts and care for and support public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, sewing factories, service stations, maternity hospitals, homes for the elderly, and other undertakings, and promote these undertakings to be run more and better. Women working in these undertakings must work wholeheartedly, continuously improve their professional level, and strive to serve production and the masses, so that everyone is satisfied.

Fourth, strive to study culture and science, and aspire to climb the peaks of culture and science.

The broad masses of women in our country deeply realize that: "Communism is heaven, and you cannot go to heaven without culture. To break through the barriers of science and technology, you must first occupy the cultural mountain." Raising the level of culture and science is an indispensable condition for building socialism at high speed. In the ten years since the founding of the country, tens of millions of women have gotten rid of illiteracy, and many former illiterates have improved to the middle school level. Many working-class and peasant women have marched towards science and made outstanding achievements. In the future, we must continue to work hard, and those who have not yet gotten rid of illiteracy must aspire to get rid of illiteracy as soon as possible in a short period. Those who have already gotten rid of illiteracy should immediately participate in amateur or specialized study. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the new Chinese women must have great ambitions, completely throw away the hat of cultural backwardness, and climb the peaks of culture and science. We must, as Chairman Mao Zedong expected, "appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture!"

Our country's women have always loved peace and have made unremitting efforts to maintain the cause of peace.

We Chinese women not only actively participate in the socialist construction of our motherland, but also have always loved peace and have made unremitting efforts to maintain the cause of peace. We are pleased to see that as a result of the repeated struggles between socialist forces, national revolutionary forces, peaceful and democratic forces, and imperialist war forces, there has been some easing of the current international tension. However, we cannot fail to note with vigilance that while playing with peaceful tricks, US imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, vigorously developing intercontinental missiles, establishing military bases everywhere, and actively reviving West German and Japanese militarism, making these two countries hotbeds of serious war danger. It is particularly noteworthy that recently US imperialism has been using fewer and fewer words of peace, and the main figures in the US ruling group are openly and blatantly making war cries again. This once again makes the people of the world more clearly realize that the nature of US imperialism will not change, it is always the main enemy of world peace, and we must maintain full vigilance against it and continue to fight it.

An important part of the US imperialist "peace" conspiracy is to undermine the unity between socialist countries, especially the unity between China and the Soviet Union. This conspiracy of theirs is nothing more than an extremely stupid fantasy. The unity between socialist countries, the unity between China and the Soviet Union, cannot be broken by any force. The more the enemy wants to undermine this unity, the more we must maintain and consolidate this unity. The Chinese women and the Chinese people, who have long been educated in internationalism by Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, have always shared the same breath and destiny with the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. For our common cause, we must cherish the unity between China and the Soviet Union and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as we cherish our own eyes. We must answer the enemy's conspiracy to undermine our unity with redoubled unity.

US imperialism also attempts to use historical legacy problems existing between our country and certain Asian countries to undermine the unity between our country and Asian countries and isolate our country. This conspiracy has also been severely hit. Not long ago, our government signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues with the Government of the Union of Burma, setting a new example for friendly cooperation and harmonious coexistence among Asian countries. Our country and Indonesia have exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on the dual nationality issue, established a joint committee to implement the treaty, and are conducting negotiations on the repatriation of overseas Chinese, which has provided a good start for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries. Our government has repeatedly suggested to the Indian government that a way to resolve the border dispute be sought through talks between the prime ministers of the two countries. We are pleased to see that the Indian government has accepted our government's suggestion, and Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai will meet in April. We believe that through the meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries, the border dispute between China and India can be resolved in a friendly and peaceful manner, thereby consolidating and developing the friendship between the people of the two countries. All of this fully demonstrates our country's sincerity in maintaining Asian-African solidarity and world peace, completely exposes the imperialist lies of slandering our country's "aggression" and "expansion", and also eloquently proves that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have great vitality and cannot be destroyed by any force.

In order to defend world peace and strive for the complete liberation of women, we Chinese women will unswervingly consolidate the unity of women in socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, consolidate the unity with women in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and consolidate the unity with women in all peace-loving countries around the world. We must further support and learn from each other in our common struggle. The current situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us, and the enemies of peace and socialism have reached the end of the road. Let us inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, hold high the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, and advance victoriously towards the great goal of world peace, human progress, and the complete liberation of women!

    发扬“三八”革命传统，向妇女彻底解放的伟大目标前进
    邓颖超在首都各界庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年大会上的讲话亲爱的朋友们！亲爱的同志们！
    今天我国首都各界妇女和各界人士在这里隆重集会，热烈地庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年。我们感到最荣幸的是有党中央和国家领导人的光临。我们荣幸地邀请了国际民主妇联的代表，苏联、朝鲜、蒙古、匈牙利等国的妇女代表，日本的妇女代表，还有各国驻华使节的夫人、协助我国进行建设的各国女专家和专家夫人，同我们一起庆祝这个光辉的节日。她们的光临，使我们的大会更加生色。我代表中国妇女，代表大会主席团向各国的贵宾们表示衷心的欢迎，向所有到会的朋友们、同志们表示热烈的祝贺。
    随着无产阶级革命和民族解放、人民民主运动的不断胜利，妇女解放运动也有了空前蓬勃的发展
    五十年前，在哥本哈根举行的第二次国际社会主义者妇女大会，根据无产阶级的先进战士和世界妇女运动卓越的领导者克拉拉·蔡特金的倡议，决定3月8日为国际劳动妇女节。从这一天起，“三八”国际劳动妇女节就成为全世界劳动妇女团结起来争取解放的节日。当我们纪念这个伟大节日的时候，我们首先要继承和发扬克拉拉·蔡特金忠实于无产阶级解放事业和妇女解放事业的革命精神。克拉拉·蔡特金毕生为保卫劳动人民的利益而奋斗。为了捍卫马克思主义的纯洁性，她曾经对第二国际的修正主义进行了不调和的斗争。她热爱和平，坚决地反对帝国主义战争和殖民战争。她坚定不移地维护劳动妇女的利益，毕生为妇女解放而奋斗。
    我们十分高兴地看到，随着无产阶级革命和民族解放、人民民主运动的不断胜利，妇女解放运动也有了空前蓬勃的发展。俄国伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，开辟了人类历史上的新纪元；在第二次世界大战后，欧洲、亚洲又建立了许多社会主义国家；从而使这些国家的妇女获得了解放，同男子一样真正成为国家的主人，对于社会主义革命和社会主义、共产主义建设做出了更大的贡献。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国，广大的妇女积极地参加了争取和维护民族独立和自身权利的斗争。在其它资本主义国家里，争取妇女儿童权利的斗争，也有了明显的进展。在全世界保卫和平的运动中，广大妇女群众发挥了越来越显著的作用，日益成为争取和平、反对帝国主义战争政策的一支重要力量。随着妇女解放运动的这种迅速发展，全世界妇女的国际团结也增强了。我们相信，在这东风压倒西风的时代，作为和平民主、社会主义事业一个重要组成部分的妇女解放运动，一定能够获得更伟大的胜利。
   在总路线的照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社的推动下，我国妇女运动从1958年起进入实现彻底解放新阶段在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，中国人民找到和坚持了社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式这三大法宝，使我国的社会主义建设出现了既高速度又按比例发展的持续跃进的局面。我国第二个五年计划的主要指标已经提前三年完成。我国人民正满怀信心地为在今后一个不太长的时期内把我国建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学文化的社会主义强国而奋斗。
    在社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社的推动下，我国妇女运动从1958年起进入了实现妇女彻底解放的新阶段。广大的城乡妇女在党的领导下，普遍地、踊跃地参加了社会劳动。农村有劳动能力的妇女几乎全部参加了人民公社的各项劳动，成为农业生产上的一支主力军。城市中大批职工家属和居民妇女，也积极地参加了社会劳动。全国女职工的队伍迅速扩大，到1959年底，已达到八百多万人，较1957年增加了约五百多万人，较解放前增加了十二倍以上。特别是街道工业中的劳动者，绝大多数是妇女，她们白手起家，自办工厂，大搞生产，对于促进城市地方工业的发展起了积极的作用。全国妇女不论在工农业生产方面，在文化、教育、科学、技术、卫生、体育等各方面，都作出了巨大的贡献。我国妇女在社会主义建设的各条战线上，深深地体会到劳动的无上光荣和愉快。无论在工厂或田野里，妇女们热情地歌颂劳动，她们唱过这样一首歌：“坡上山歌谁最多？姑娘一气唱几箩，唱到嫦娥宫门望，唱得织女停了梭，都说天上不可恋，要到公社来干活，公社生活多欢畅，姐姐妹妹笑呵呵”。许许多多这一类的民歌，充分地表现了新中国妇女在劳动中的无比欢乐和自豪。她们的心情同资本主义社会里被迫进行奴役劳动的妇女的心情恰成鲜明的对照。这就可以看出帝国主义分子诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”，是何等可笑和愚蠢！
    适应着生产大跃进和广大妇女参加社会劳动的需要，我国城乡各地正在普遍地实现着家务劳动的社会化，集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业已经广泛地建立起来，并且正在走上巩固和健全发展的道路。从山区到平原，从农村到城市，到处都有公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、妇产院和敬老院，集体生活习惯已经普遍地树立起来。以北京为例，就有一万二千多个公共食堂。一千二百多个服务修理组织。一万八千多个托儿所、幼儿园，收托了六十一万多儿童。郊区已有92．4％的农户加入公共食堂，解放了二十五万多妇女劳力参加生产。市区有近二十万家庭妇女参加了社会劳动。如同北京一样，全国各地的集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，都有了迅速的发展和提高，这就保证了妇女能够安心地参加劳动，并且有力地促进了生产事业的发展。
    广大妇女在党的领导下参加社会劳动和集体生活的结果，不仅促进了社会的改造和进步；同时也促进了妇女自身的改造和进步。我国广大妇女已经成为既有高度的社会主义觉悟，又有一定的技术、文化水平的光荣的社会劳动者。她们精神焕发，斗志昂扬，打破了几千年遗留下来的自卑感，表现了什么也能干，什么也干得好的英雄气概。她们发扬了共产主义的精神，见先进就学，见落后就帮，见困难就上，见方便就让。舍己为公，助人为乐，已经在广大妇女中形成风气。工商界妇女也在努力自我改造，有不少人还参加了社会劳动，在由剥削者改造为劳动者的道路上前进了一大步。妇女在社会上的地位大大提高了，封建家长制被彻底破除了，民主和睦的新家庭普遍地建立起来了。
    在劳动生产中出现了千百万妇女先进集体和先进人物，她们遍及农村、城市和各条战线，真是标兵成列，红旗成林。今天就有不少先进妇女和先进集体的妇女代表出席了我们的大会。这是值得我们引为光荣和自豪的。
    为了巩固和发展我们的成就，全国妇女要努力学习理论和文化科学，积极投入技术革命运动，并大力办好集体生活福利事业和服务事业我国妇女运动的伟大成就，是全国广大妇女和全国人民一起，在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下，顽强劳动、英勇奋斗的结果。为了巩固和发展我们的成就，全国妇女要同全国人民一起，更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚持发展社会主义建设事业的三大法宝，为实现持续的跃进和更好的跃进而奋斗。为此我们向全国妇女提出以下四个方面的任务：
    第一、全国妇女要热烈地投入学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的运动，进一步提高政治觉悟和思想理论水平。
    我国人民从自己的切身经验中，深刻地认识到，马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的真理，毛泽东思想则是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范。毛泽东主席创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义，引导我们取得了新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，现在正引导我们继续深入地进行社会主义革命和高速度地发展社会主义建设，今后还一定会引导我们在社会主义道路上取得更大的胜利，并在将来向共产主义胜利前进。
    现在，在人民群众中已经形成了学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的热潮，很多妇女踊跃地积极地参加了这个学习。通过这个学习，我们一定会更巩固地树立起无产阶级的世界观，站稳立场，明辨是非，坚持党的正确路线，同右倾机会主义和现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。通过这个学习，我们就会永远保持旺盛的革命意志，充分发挥不断革命的精神，沿着党所指出的道路，奋勇前进。我们的学习运动开始不久，全国妇女要更普遍地投到这个运动中去，边实践，边学习，学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，用这种伟大的思想来武装我们的头脑，以便对社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。
    第二、全国妇女要继续大鼓干劲，踊跃参加党所号召的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。
    凡有劳动能力而没有参加劳动的妇女，应当按照国家的需要，自觉地参加社会劳动。已经参加社会劳动的妇女，要积极地参加技术革新和技术革命，勇敢地投入手工操作机械化、半机械化的群众运动，这个运动是当前高速度发展社会主义建设、提高劳动效率、减轻体力劳动的重要关键，也是我国广大人民和妇女群众的迫切要求。我们要进一步解放思想，破除迷信，继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的精神，把这个革命运动普及到各条战线和各个角落，在现代化大企业中要努力开展自动化、半自动化的群众运动。我们要从各个方面使我们国家的生产技术面貌有一个巨大的改变，使我国的生产力得到更高速度的发展。
    第三、大力办好集体生活福利事业和服务事业，进一步实现家务劳动社会化，把分散的、繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造成为集体的社会主义经济事业。
    伟大的革命导师列宁曾经说过：“只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”我国妇女从切身体会中深刻的认识列宁这一教导的英明和正确。实现家务劳动社会化，组织集体生活，既能充分解放劳动力，促进社会主义生产的高速度发展，又能培养人们的共产主义精神，建立人与人的友爱团结的新关系；还使家庭生活更加民主和睦和幸福，使儿童得到更好的社会教养，成为共产主义的新人。因此，我们要努力促使集体生活方式逐步成为主要的生活方式。
    我们要在主要家务劳动社会化的基础上，向全面组织集体生活发展。全国妇女要群策群力，关怀和支持公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫厂、服务站、妇产院、敬老院等事业，促使这些事业办得更多、更好。在这些事业中工作的妇女，更要全心全意作好工作，不断提高业务水平，努力为生产服务，为群众服务，使大家称心满意。
   第四、努力学习文化、科学，立志攀登文化科学高峰。
    我国广大妇女深深体会到：“共产主义是天堂，没有文化不能上，要破科学技术关，先要占领文化山。”提高文化科学水平是高速度建设社会主义不可缺少的条件。建国十年来，几千万妇女摆脱了文盲状态，不少原来的文盲提高到中学水平，许多工农妇女向科学进军，作出了出色的成绩。今后我们还要继续努力，未脱盲的要立志在一个短时期中，尽快脱盲。已经脱盲的要紧接着参加业余或专门的学习。在毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下的新中国妇女，要有雄心大志，彻底扔掉文化落后的帽子，攀登文化科学的高峰。一定要像毛泽东主席所期望的那样，“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界！”
   我国妇女一贯爱好和平，对维护和平事业进行了不懈的努力
    我们中国妇女不仅积极参加祖国的社会主义建设，而且一贯爱好和平，对维护和平的事业进行了不懈的努力。我们高兴地看到，由于社会主义力量、民族革命力量、和平民主力量同帝国主义战争势力反复进行斗争的结果，目前国际紧张局势出现了某些缓和的趋势。但是，我们不能不警惕地注意到，美帝国主义在玩弄和平手法的同时，正在加紧扩军备战，大力发展洲际导弹，到处建立军事基地，积极复活西德和日本的军国主义，使这两个国家成为严重战争危险的策源地。特别值得注意的是，最近以来美帝国主义连和平的言词也越来越少了，美国统治集团中的主要人物又在公开露骨地进行战争叫嚣。这就再一次让全世界人民更加认清美帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，它始终是世界和平的主要敌人，必须对它保持充分的警惕，再接再厉地同它进行斗争。
    美帝国主义“和平”阴谋中的一个重要内容就是要破坏社会主义国家之间的团结，特别是中苏两国之间的团结，它的这个阴谋不过是一个极端愚蠢的幻想。社会主义国家间的团结，中苏两国的团结是任何力量也不能把它拆散的。敌人越是要破坏这种团结，我们就越要维护和巩固这种团结。长期以来受着毛泽东主席和中国共产党国际主义教育的中国妇女和中国人民，从来就和以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭同呼吸，共命运。为了我们共同的事业，我们一定要像爱护自己的眼珠一样来维护中苏两国和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。我们要用加倍的团结来回答敌人破坏我们团结的阴谋。
    美帝国主义还妄图利用我国同某些亚洲国家间存在的历史遗留问题来破坏我国同亚洲国家的团结，把我国孤立起来。这种阴谋也遭到了沉重的打击。不久以前，我国政府同缅甸联邦政府签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，以及中缅关于边界问题的协定，为亚洲各国的友好合作与和睦相处树立了一个新的范例。我国同印度尼西亚已经交换了关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书，成立了执行这个条约的联合委员会，并且正在进行有关遣送华侨回国问题的谈判，使全面解决存在于两国间的华侨问题有了良好的开端。我国政府一再向印度政府建议，经过两国总理的会谈来寻求解决边界争端的途径。我们高兴地看到，印度政府已经接受了我国政府的建议，尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理即将在4月间会晤。我们相信，经过两国总理的会晤，中印两国关于边界的争端完全有可能友好地、和平地解决，从而使两国人民的友谊得到巩固和发展。所有这一切充分说明了我国对于维护亚非团结和世界和平的诚意，彻底戳穿了帝国主义诬蔑我国“侵略”、“扩张”的谎言，同时也雄辩地证明了和平共处五项原则有着伟大的生命力，是任何力量也破坏不了的。
    为了保卫世界和平，为了争取妇女的彻底解放，我们中国妇女将坚持不渝地巩固以苏联为首的社会主义国家妇女的团结，巩固同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国妇女的团结，巩固同全世界一切爱好和平的各国妇女的团结。我们要在共同斗争中进一步地互相支持，互相学习。目前形势对我们空前有利，和平和社会主义的敌人已经走上穷途末路。认我们继承和发扬“三八”国际劳动妇女节的革命传统，高高举起和平、民主、社会主义的旗帜，向着世界和平，人类进步和妇女彻底解放的伟大目标胜利前进！
