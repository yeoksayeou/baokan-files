    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd. Our naval forces on the Fujian Front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, sank a Chiang Kai-shek gunboat on the 1st.
    At noon on the 1st, on the sea southeast of Beichuan Island in northeastern Fujian, a No. 517 gunboat belonging to the First Detachment of the Naval Task Force of Chiang Kai-shek's army in Taiwan suddenly intruded into our fishing grounds where production was underway, attempting to disrupt fishery production. Upon receiving the news, the People's Navy on the Fujian Front immediately dispatched vessels to the fishing grounds and launched a fierce attack on the enemy gunboat. After about half an hour of intense fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek gunboat was destroyed by our forces and sank into the sea. Twelve Chiang Kai-shek soldiers on board were killed, and ten were captured.
    All our naval vessels and fishing boats returned to port safely. They were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.

    新华社福建前线2日电　中国人民解放军福建前线海军部队，1日击沉蒋军炮艇一艘。
    1日中午，在闽东北北礵岛东南海面上，台湾蒋军海军一纵队水上支队五一七号炮艇一艘，突然窜入我正进行生产的渔场，企图破坏渔业生产。我福建前线人民海军闻讯后，立即派出艇只驰往渔场，对敌炮艇展开猛烈攻击。激战约半小时，蒋军炮艇被我击毁，沉没海中。艇上蒋军被我击毙十二人，俘虏十人。
    我军艇只和渔船全部安全回港。他们受到当地军民的热烈欢迎。
