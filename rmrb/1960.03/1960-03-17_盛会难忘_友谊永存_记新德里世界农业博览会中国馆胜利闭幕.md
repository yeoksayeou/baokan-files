    Unforgettable Gathering, Everlasting Friendship
    —A Record of the Successful Closing of the China Pavilion at the New Delhi World Agricultural Fair
    By Our Correspondent Tu Peilin
    On the World Agricultural Fair grounds, ablaze with lights and a riot of color, a blaze of brilliant lights went out, the 81-day event came to an end, and the six palace-style vermilion gates of the China Pavilion closed. But on the night of that day, an Indian farmer came to the China Pavilion, representing the farmers of Batholohen village in Punjab Province, to invite Chinese farmers to visit them. Ten days earlier, after visiting the China Pavilion, he returned to the village and introduced it to everyone, sparking a desire in many to come and see it in Delhi. But how could so many people come? After thinking it over, they decided to invite Chinese farmers to visit the village. This representative, who had traveled a long distance, said to the staff of the China Pavilion with a sincere heart: "Go! We have prepared everything, and everyone is waiting to welcome the Chinese farmer brothers! ..."
    This happened on February 29th. On this day, the newspapers of the Indian capital prominently published, under a banner headline, Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of February 26th in response to Prime Minister Nehru, announcing that Premier Zhou would visit Delhi in April for talks between the two prime ministers. This "best, best news," as the vast majority of the Indian people called it, brought an exceptionally moving atmosphere to the last day of the China Pavilion's exhibition at the World Agricultural Fair.
    A little after one o'clock in the afternoon, before the opening time, many Indian visitors were already waiting in front of the China Pavilion. For the past eighty-one days, this place has been a constant surge of people. Despite the various acts of resistance and sabotage carried out by certain reactionary elements in India before and after the opening of the China Pavilion, the friendship between China and India, with its long history of two thousand years, cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces. The iron fact that more than three million people from all walks of life in India visited the China Pavilion in eighty-one days is the best illustration of how deep the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people is! Indian farmers praised the China Pavilion as "the most attractive pavilion," Indian agronomists said that the China Pavilion contained "extremely rich agricultural knowledge," Indian poets came to collect the fast-paced rhymes created by Chinese farmers during the Great Leap Forward, and agricultural workers from various places came to exchange experiences and study how China, with a population larger than India, solved the food problem. Prime Minister Nehru also visited the China Pavilion a few days before the closing of the expo.
    Look! A milk farm worker with graying hair has squeezed into the crowd and entered the gate again today. With four paper packages tucked under his left arm, he leads his brother, familiar with the crowded place, to find Chen Bingyin next to the electric model of the Chayashan People's Commune. This milk farm worker is visiting the China Pavilion for the fifteenth time. More than a month ago, since he met Chen Bingyin, the director of the Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, China, next to this model, the hearts of two working people have been closely linked. Although the two had never met before and were thousands of miles apart, they had similar experiences in the difficult journey of life. They talked heart-to-heart, took pictures together, and quickly became as close as brothers. Seeing that Chen Bingyin was too busy to find time to visit him at home, this ordinary Indian worker prepared Indian food, wine, fruit, cigarettes, and snacks at home and brought his family to the China Pavilion to find Chen Bingyin. In the last week or so before the China Pavilion was about to close, he came to see Chen Bingyin every day. Today, he once again opened the Indian snacks he brought one by one, wanting Chen Bingyin to taste them again. He said: "From tomorrow on, it will be difficult for me to see you again, but I will never forget the sincerity of the Chinese people. India and China are truly brothers. For the eternal friendship between the two countries for thousands and millions of years, I am willing to use the water of the Ganges to pray every day!"
    February 29th was not a holiday, but the huge China Pavilion, covering more than 70,000 square feet, was still packed with people. Many visitors were seizing the last opportunity to copy the experiences and measures for increasing production on the walls, and many were using the last few hours before the closing to talk to Chinese experts and people's commune directors to understand the issues they hoped to learn about... For more than two months, the China Pavilion has held more than 800 such technical seminars, and more than 800,000 copies of exhibition materials have been taken away. The small packets of improved seeds of Chinese high-yield crops were even regarded as the most precious gifts by Indian farmers. More than twenty days ago, when the staff of the China Pavilion went to visit Gota in the suburbs of Delhi, the nearby farmers surrounded them when they learned about it, specifically asking for the fifteen-foot-tall sorghum seeds from the China Pavilion. Many such high-yield crops and rice transplanters in the China Pavilion have become well-known. Even many remote provinces in India write letters every day to request information on seeds and technology. Look! The dense crowds in the outdoor square, surrounding the Chinese rice transplanters, vegetable seeders, and simple harvesters, are drawing and taking pictures. A week ago, the Madras State Exhibition Hall, with the help of the China Pavilion, had successfully replicated a wooden Hunan Liling simple rice transplanter and began exhibiting it in their hall. Today, the Madras Pavilion sent people again to request that the China Pavilion delay packing another iron-made South 105B rice transplanter for a few days after the closing, because they had taken detailed photos of each part and were replicating it, hoping that the Chinese friends could assist them in inspecting and correcting it once again before returning home. The staff of the China Pavilion readily agreed to this request, and the Madras Pavilion staff who came to negotiate extended their grateful hands, not knowing what to say.
    An Indian worker named Mina, who had talked with Luo Shifa, the director of the Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, came to find Luo Shifa again on the last day of the closing. He handed Luo Shifa a brand-new badminton racket, saying: "You know I don't have any money, I can't afford anything else, so please take this item to your people's commune!" Luo Shifa took the gift, and his heart was so excited when he shook hands with this Indian! Millions of Indian people have come to understand the people's communes by visiting the Chinese agricultural exhibition and listening to the introductions of Chinese farmers. They congratulated the Chinese people's communes on the great achievements they have already made in the visitors' book, and they praised it as "a symbol of the Chinese people's determination to get rid of poverty forever and strive to build their own happy lives." They no longer believed the lies spread by reactionary elements that the people's communes were "forced slave labor." A group of visitors from West Bengal said well in the visitors' book: "Only after the slaves are liberated can China's agricultural production achieve such great achievements. This is a brilliant example of fully developing human creativity and wisdom!"
    The Indian people, who came to visit the China Pavilion in a continuous stream, wrote their warm congratulations and wishes for friendship in the visitors' book with sincere language. At this moment of parting, people felt the preciousness of friendship even more. Baindar, of the Bombay Rice Science Research Laboratory, presented a beautiful Indian handicraft to his Chinese friend, Yan Ji, a Chinese rice expert, as a permanent souvenir when he said goodbye on the last day of the closing. Ge Qielaxin, the head of the dairy farm at the Pusa Agricultural Research Institute, also rushed to the China Pavilion to invite animal husbandry expert Xiong Deshao to visit his home again before returning home. The Central Botanical Garden, located in the Northern Province, sent the seedlings that the China Pavilion had hoped to obtain when the two sides exchanged seeds and technical information a few days ago, and sincerely hoped that the two countries would exchange more experiences in agricultural science in the future.
    The bell rang, and the closing time finally arrived. The 81-day China Pavilion came to an end, and many visitors still wanted to enter the pavilion for a last look. And when many reluctant visitors finally stepped out of the vermilion gate, another moving scene appeared in the hall. - Indian docents and public service personnel who assisted in the China Pavilion for more than two months said goodbye to their Chinese friends reluctantly. A few days ago, at a get-together, everyone sang "The Sino-Indian Friendship Song" together with deep affection. Today, they exchanged contact addresses for the last time, exchanging photos and souvenirs... The Indian friend who explained the model of the Chayashan People's Commune pinned a peace dove badge with outstretched wings on Chen Bingyin's chest. Chen Bingyin held his hands tightly and thanked him for his hard work for the China Pavilion for more than two months. It was he who, during the entire exhibition, did not want to rest for a day. Once he fell off his bicycle and injured his leg, but he still insisted on rushing over, standing next to the model from morning to night and explaining to the audience again and again how earth-shaking changes had taken place in Chayashan, China. What an unforgettable friendship! The Indian friend who served as the docent for the industrial part of the People's Commune took out his photo and a crane carved from a cow horn and gave it to Ma Baoshan, the director of the Hanjiawa People's Commune in Ding County, Hebei, as a souvenir of friendship, and he said humorously: "Whenever I forget you, let my tongue stick to my palate, and I will never be able to speak again in my life!"
    Long tables began to be set up in the exhibition hall of the China Pavilion, and friends who had spent eighty days together were going to have a final dinner here tonight to say goodbye. When people said goodbye, they felt the warmth of the two huge photos hanging on both sides of the wall even more. This is a group photo of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru visiting Delhi and Beijing respectively. How many visitors have walked past here every day and looked up affectionately at this photo showing friendship! Dr. Kechilou, the son of an Indian peace activist who assisted in the China Pavilion, said passionately at this farewell party: "Premier Zhou Enlai will come to India in April to meet with Prime Minister Nehru. This is the best, best news. Our two countries have been on friendly terms since ancient times. Through the efforts of the prime ministers and people of the two countries, I believe that the dark clouds surrounding the relations between the two countries will quickly dissipate. Let us all work together!"
    The spring night in New Delhi is beautiful. On this last night of the closing of the World Agricultural Fair, the pavilions of various countries participating in the expo, as well as the central and provincial states of India, were brightly lit, illuminating the 5.2 million square feet of the expo site in an extraordinarily beautiful and moving way. Prime Minister Nehru personally presided over the closing ceremony, and Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan presided over the awards ceremony. In the night sky, a series of brilliant fireworks rose, and in the midst of shooting stars, colorful clouds, and cheers, the 81-day World Agricultural Fair was officially declared closed. The crowd surrounded and shook hands with the representatives of the China Pavilion in a friendly manner, cheering "The Indian and Chinese people are brothers!" Congratulating the China Pavilion on its great success in Delhi.
    The eighty-one days that the China Agricultural Exhibition Hall spent in India were unforgettable. The comrades of the China Pavilion deeply felt the depth of friendship between the people of China and India from here. Everyone still clearly remembers the farewell words spoken by the Indian farmers who came to the China Pavilion in the dark night after the closing of the expo and happily took back the Chinese rice, corn, and soybean seeds: "Let these many seeds blossom and bear good fruit on the land of India, we will always remember the friendship of the Chinese brothers!"

    盛会难忘　友谊永存
    ——记新德里世界农业博览会中国馆胜利闭幕
    本报记者　屠培林
    在火树银花、万紫千红的世界农业博览会广场上，一片灿烂辉煌的灯火熄灭了，历时八十一天的盛会结束了，中国展览馆六扇宫殿式的朱红大门也阖上了。但在这一天的夜间，有一个印度农民找上中国馆来，他代表旁遮普省巴脱洛亨村的农民们邀请中国农民到他们那里去作客。他在十天以前参观了中国馆后，回村向大家作了介绍，引起许多人想到德里来看一看的愿望。可是这么多人怎能都来呢？想来想去，还是请中国农民到村里来作客吧。这位从远路赶来的代表，带着一片真诚的心意对中国馆工作人员说：“去吧！我们一切都准备好了，大家都在等着欢迎中国农民兄弟的光临！……”
    这是发生在2月29日的事情。也就是在这一天，印度首都的报纸以通栏标题，显著地刊载了周恩来总理2月26日答复尼赫鲁总理的信，周总理将在4月间来德里访问，举行两国总理会谈。这一被广大印度人民称作是“最好最好的消息”，给世界农业博览会中国馆最后一天展出带来了格外动人的气氛。
    下午一点多钟，开馆的时间还没有到，中国展览馆门前就已经等候着许许多多印度观众。八十一天来，这里经常是人似潮涌。尽管印度某些反动分子在中国馆开幕前后进行了各种各样的抵制和破坏活动，可是有着两千年悠久历史的中印友谊，决非任何反动势力所能加以破坏的。八十一天里有三百多万印度各阶层人民到中国馆参观这一铁的事实，再好不过地说明了中印两国人民之间的友谊是何等深厚！印度农民赞扬中国馆是“最吸引人的馆”，印度农学家说中国馆里“有着极其丰富的农业知识”，印度诗人前来收集中国农民在大跃进中创作的快板，各地农业工作人员前来交流经验，研究人口比印度还多的中国怎样解决了粮食问题。尼赫鲁总理也在博览会即将闭幕的前几天参观了中国馆。
    你看！一位头发已经灰白的牛奶场工人，今天又挤在人堆里走进大门来了。他左手挟着四个纸包，领着他的兄弟，熟悉地穿过拥挤的人群，在嵖岈山人民公社电动模型旁边找到了陈丙寅。这个牛奶场工人已经是第十五次来中国馆了。一个多月以前，自从他在这个模型旁边结识了中国河南省遂平县嵖岈山人民公社社长陈丙寅，两颗劳动人民的心就紧紧连在一起。虽然两个人过去从不相识，相距万里，但在生活的艰辛历程里，彼此曾经有过一段相似的遭遇。他们促膝谈心，一起照相，很快就亲如兄弟。这个印度普通的劳动者看到陈丙寅忙得无法抽空上他家里去作客，他就在家里准备了印度的酒菜水果和纸烟点心，带着一家老小一起到中国馆来找陈丙寅。在中国馆即将闭幕的最后一个多星期里，他天天都要来看一看陈丙寅。今天，他又亲手一包包打开了带来的印度的点心，要陈丙寅再尝一尝。他说：“从明天以后，我很难再见到你了，但是中国人的一片真心，我永远忘不了。印度和中国真是兄弟啊。为了两国千年万年的永恒友谊，我愿用恒河之水来天天祝祷！”
    2月29日，并不是假日，可是占地七万多平方英尺的偌大的中国馆，依然人头钻动。多少参观者抓紧最后的机会在忙着抄录墙上的增产经验和措施，多少人利用闭馆前的最后几小时忙着找中国的专家和人民公社社长交谈希望了解的问题……。两个多月来，中国馆已经进行了八百多次这样的技术座谈，八十多万份展览资料被索取一空。那一小包一小包中国高产作物的良种，更被印度农民视为最珍贵的礼物。二十几天前，当中国馆工作人员去德里郊区的高塔游览时，附近的农民知道了就围了上来，指名要中国展览馆里的那一颗高达十五尺的高粱种子。中国馆里许多这样的高产作物和水稻插秧机已经是远近闻名。连印度许多偏僻的省份都每天有信写来，索取有关种子和技术的资料。你看！室外广场上那走了一批又来一批的密密层层的人群，围着中国的水稻插秧机、蔬菜播种机和简易收割机等，在画图、照相。一个星期前，印度马德拉斯邦展览馆在中国馆帮助下，已经仿制成功了一架木制湖南醴陵简易插秧机，开始在他们馆里展出。今天，马德拉斯馆又派人来要求中国馆在闭幕后能把另一架铁制的南105B型水稻插秧机迟几天装箱，因为他们已经拍下了它每个零件的详细照片，正在进行仿制，希望中国朋友在回国前能再一次协助他们加以检验校正。中国馆的工作人员毫不犹豫地答应了这一要求，那个前来接洽的马德拉斯馆工作人员伸出感谢的双手高兴得不知说什么好。
    一个曾经同四川省新繁县新民人民公社社长罗世发交谈过的印度工人米纳，在闭幕的最后一天，又来找罗世发。他把手里一张崭新的羽毛球拍塞给罗世发说：“你知道我没钱，买不起别的，就请你把这一件东西带给你的人民公社吧！”罗世发接过礼物，握着这个印度人的手时，心里多么激动啊！千千万万印度人民通过参观中国农业展览馆和听了中国农民的介绍，对人民公社已经有了了解。他们在观众留言簿上祝贺中国人民公社所已经取得的伟大成就，他们称颂“这是中国人民决心永远摆脱贫困，努力建设自己幸福生活的标志”。他们再也不相信反动分子造谣说什么人民公社是“强迫奴隶劳动”等谎言了。一群来自西孟加拉省的参观者在留言簿上说得好：“只有奴隶获得了解放之后，才能使中国农业生产获得如此巨大的成就，这是充分发挥了人类创造力和智慧的一个光辉的榜样！”
    川流不息地到中国馆来参观的印度人民，用真挚的语言，把他们的热忱的祝贺和友谊的愿望写在观众留言簿上。在这惜别的时刻里，人们更觉得友谊的可贵。孟买水稻科学研究实验室的贝恩达尔，在闭馆最后一天同我国水稻专家颜济话别时，把一件美丽的印度工艺品赠给中国朋友留作永久纪念。普沙农业研究院乳牛场负责人葛却拉姆辛，也赶来中国馆再一次邀请畜牧专家熊德邵在回国前到他家里去作客。设在北方省的中央植物园更派人送来了几天前双方交换种子和技术资料时中国馆所盼望得到的苗木，并且热诚希望两国今后在农业科学上多多交流经验。
    铃声响了，闭馆的时间终于到了，历时八十一天的中国馆到此结束了，不少的观众还想进馆来最后看一看。而当许多恋恋不舍的观众最后跨出朱红大门时，大厅里出现了又一幅动人的场面。——两个多月来在中国馆协助工作的印度讲解员和公勤人员依依惜别地同中国朋友们话别。几天前，在一次联欢会上，大家深情地一起唱过“印中友好歌”，今天，又最后地交换了通讯地址，交换着照片和纪念品……。讲解嵖岈山人民公社模型的印度朋友，把一只展翅飞翔的和平鸽纪念章佩在陈丙寅的胸前。陈丙寅紧握住他的双手，感谢他两个多月来为中国馆所付出的辛劳。就是他，在整个展出期间一天都不愿休息，有一次他骑自行车摔伤了腿，也还是一拐一拐地坚持赶来，从早到晚站在模型旁边一遍又一遍地向观众讲解在中国嵖岈山发生了怎样翻天复地的变化。这真是难忘的友谊啊！在人民公社工业部分担任讲解的印度朋友，拿出自己的照片和一座牛角雕刻的仙鹤送给河北定县韩家洼人民公社社长马宝山留作友谊的纪念，他并且诙谐地说：“我什么时候要忘了你们，就让我的舌头粘住上颚，一辈子永不能再说话！”
    中国馆展览大厅里开始摆起了长长的餐桌，相处了八十来天的朋友今晚要在这里最后聚餐话别。当人们告别时，更感到高悬在两边墙上那两张巨幅照片的亲切。这是周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理相互访问德里和北京时的合影。每天有多少参观者走过这里时曾经深情地抬头凝望过这幅表现着友谊的照片！在中国馆协助工作的印度和平人士克其鲁博士的儿子满怀激情地在这个告别会上讲话说：“周恩来总理即将在4月间到印度来同尼赫鲁总理会见了，这是最好最好的消息。我们两个国家自古以来就一直友好相处。通过两国总理和人民的努力，相信笼罩着两国关系的阴云一定会迅速消散。让我们大家一起努力吧！”
    新德里的春夜是美丽的。在这世界农业博览会闭幕的最后一个晚上，参加博览会的各国和印度中央以及各省邦的展览馆无不彩炬缤纷，灯火齐明，把占地五百二十万平方英尺的博览会广场照耀得格外艳丽动人。尼赫鲁总理亲自来主持闭幕式，印度副总统拉达克里希南主持了授奖。夜空里，升起了一串串灿烂的焰火，在流星四射、霞光万道、一片欢呼声中，历时八十一天的世界农业博览会正式宣告闭幕。人群围上来友好地同中国展览馆的代表握手，欢呼“印中人民是兄弟！”祝贺中国展览馆在德里所取得的巨大成功。
    中国农业展览馆在印度度过的这八十一天的日子是令人难忘的。中国馆的同志从这里深切体会到了中印两国人民之间友谊的深厚。大家到现在都还清楚记得在博览会闭幕后的黑夜里找上中国馆来的印度农民高兴地带回中国水稻、玉米和大豆种子时所说的告别的话：“让这许多种子在印度的土地上很好的开花结果吧，我们将永远记得中国兄弟的友谊！”（附图片）
