    African Women in the Torrent
    With the increasing upsurge of the African people's struggle against colonialism, African women, who have suffered deeply, are also increasingly awakened and widely involved in the torrent of struggle. They know that "without national independence, there will be no real happiness for women."

    Algerian Women Dedicated to the National Liberation War
    In Algeria, women have become a vital force in the national liberation war. Some take up guns and fight alongside men against the French colonial army; some serve as liaison officers in the army, risking their lives to cross police cordons every hundred meters to carry out missions. In medical teams, there are many female doctors and nurses who not only take care of the wounded but also treat the local people, strengthening the ties between the army and the people. When the National Liberation Army arrives, rural women are not only responsible for guarding and washing clothes and preparing meals for the soldiers, but also for transporting weapons and communicating.

    In recent years, the French colonial army has pursued an extremely barbaric policy of terror in Algeria. Algerian women have shown great courage in the face of enemy torture and massacres. The Algerian heroine Djamila Bouhired, known to people all over the world, was arrested by the French army in 1957 and subjected to severe torture, but she always showed a heroic spirit of unyieldingness. Algerian female communist Jacqueline Gueroutj, solemnly declared in the French colonialists' court: "In the world, what I hate most is war, but I cannot but fight." She gave her young and precious life for the happiness and freedom of the people. So many patriotic Algerian women have dedicated themselves to the sacred cause of national liberation.

    South African Women Standing at the Forefront of the Struggle Against Racial Discrimination
    In the Union of South Africa, which suffers the most from racial discrimination, women not only actively participate in the struggle against racial discrimination, but also often stand at the forefront of the struggle.

    In recent years, organizations such as the African National Congress Women's League and the Federation of South African Women have led the vast number of women to launch continuous activities centered on opposing pass laws. On August 9, 1956, more than 20,000 women gathered in Pretoria to demonstrate against pass laws. Since that year, every August 9th, women have been fighting against pass laws and racial discrimination in various ways. In 1958, the heroic struggle of South African women against the Identity Documents Act reached a climax. The South African authorities carried out a brutal suppression of unarmed women, arresting more than two thousand women in three weeks from October to November. But the South African authorities' prisons and clubs could not scare the brave women. The anti-racial discrimination riots that broke out in Durban Port in June 1959, mainly involving women, and the widespread demonstrations by women in the Nanoor area from August to October to fight for democratic rights, made the South African white rulers feel frightened.

    Last November, Africans in the Vaal region of South Africa held a demonstration to protest the white government's conspiracy to exile Mrs. Mafeking, a South African trade union leader.

    In many other African countries, women have also actively participated in the struggle against colonial rule for independence and freedom. Women in Cameroon are also fighting alongside the Cameroonian people against British and French imperialism for national liberation. Women in Nigeria, Uganda, Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Ivory Coast, French Sudan, Upper Volta, Zanzibar, Basutoland, Kenya and other places are also increasingly participating in nationalist political parties, establishing their own women's organizations, and actively fighting for national independence and freedom.

    激流中的非洲妇女
    随着非洲人民反殖民主义斗争的日益高涨，遭受着深重苦难的非洲妇女也日益觉醒，广泛地投入了斗争的洪流，她们知道“没有民族独立，就不会有妇女的真正幸福”。
    献身于民族解放战争的阿尔及利亚妇女
    在阿尔及利亚，妇女已经成为民族解放战争中的一支生力军。她们有的拿起枪杆，和男子并肩和法国殖民军队作战；有的在军队里当联络员，冒着生命危险越过每一百米一道的警察封锁线去执行任务。在医疗队里，有许多女医生和女护士，她们不仅照顾伤员，而且替驻地人民治疗疾病，加强了军民联系。农村妇女在民族解放军来到的时候，不但负责放哨和替士兵洗衣服、准备伙食，还担负武器运输和通讯联系工作。
    几年来，法国殖民军队在阿尔及利亚推行极端野蛮的恐怖政策。阿尔及利亚妇女在敌人的酷刑和屠杀面前，表现了极大的勇气。全世界人民都熟悉的阿尔及利亚女英雄加米拉·布伊海德，在1957年被法军逮捕后受到了严刑拷打，但是始终表现了宁死不屈的英雄气概。阿尔及利亚女共产党员热克林·盖鲁特日在法国殖民者的法庭上严正宣告：“在世界上我最憎恶的是战争，但是我又不能不去战斗”。她为人民的幸福和自由献出了年青的宝贵生命。阿尔及利亚多少爱国妇女就这样献身于神圣的民族解放事业。
    站在反对种族歧视斗争前列的南非妇女
    在受种族歧视祸害最深的南非联邦，妇女们不仅积极地参加了反对种族歧视斗争，而且常常站在斗争的前列。
    近几年来，非洲人国民大会妇女联盟和南非妇女联合会等组织领导了广大妇女以反对通行证为中心连续不断地展开各种活动。1956年8月9日，有两万多名妇女聚集在比勒陀利亚市举行反对通行证的示威。从这一年开始，每年的8月9日，妇女都以各种各样的方式进行反对通行证和反对种族歧视的斗争。1958年，南非妇女反对身份证法的英勇斗争形成高潮。南非当局对手无寸铁的妇女进行了残酷的镇压，在10月到11月的三周内即逮捕了二千多名妇女。但是南非当局的监狱和大棒吓不倒勇敢的妇女。1959年6月在德班港爆发的主要由妇女参加的反对种族歧视的暴动以及8月到10月间在纳诺尔地区广泛展开的妇女争取民主权利的示威斗争，使南非白人统治者感到心惊。
    去年11月，南非巴尔地区的非洲人举行了示威游行，抗议白人政府阴谋放逐南非工会领袖马费肯夫人。
    在非洲其它许多国家里，妇女们也都积极参加了反对殖民统治争取独立自由的斗争。喀麦隆的妇女也正和喀麦隆人民一道进行反对英法帝国主义的民族解放斗争。在尼日利亚、乌干达、尼亚萨兰、南罗得西亚、坦噶尼喀、象牙海岸、法属苏丹、上伏尔特、桑给巴尔、巴苏陀兰、怯尼亚等地的妇女也正在日益增多地参加民族主义的政党、建立妇女自己的组织，积极地为民族独立、自由进行斗争。
