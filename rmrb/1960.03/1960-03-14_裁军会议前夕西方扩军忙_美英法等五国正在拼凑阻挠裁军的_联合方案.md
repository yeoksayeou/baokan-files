Western Countries Busy Expanding Armaments on Eve of Disarmament Conference
US, Britain, France and Other Five Countries Are Cobbling Together a "Joint Plan" to Obstruct Disarmament

(Xinhua News Agency, March 12th) The East-West Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will begin its meeting in Geneva on the 15th. The Soviet Union proposed a comprehensive and thorough disarmament plan last September, and in January of this year, it decided to unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million troops again. These major steps taken by the Soviet Union to actively promote universal disarmament have been warmly welcomed by the public worldwide. Now, whether the Geneva disarmament talks can make progress depends entirely on the attitude of the Western countries, headed by the United States.

But how are the United States and other Western countries preparing for the new disarmament negotiations?

Although Eisenhower has repeatedly stated recently that "the United States is wholeheartedly committed to relentlessly seeking genuine disarmament with guarantees that eliminate suspicion and fear," he himself has proposed a direct military spending budget of more than $45.5 billion for the next fiscal year in the United States. U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates also claimed on the 10th that if necessary, he would "certainly not hesitate to recommend an increase" in the military budget. The United States is also concentrating on developing intercontinental missiles, stepping up the establishment of a missile base network overseas, and announced on the 8th that it would immediately send two more missile battalions to Western Europe. The US President has also declared that the United States will have the freedom to resume nuclear weapons testing at any time in the future, and the US armed forces will continue to maintain their current level in the coming year.

The United States has also put forward a plan for the entire North Atlantic Group to strengthen its preparations for war in the next ten years. According to the plan, the Supreme Commander of the US North Atlantic Group Forces, Norstad, recently announced that a new multinational joint atomic assault force will be established in Western Europe within a year. Norstad reported to the US Congress on the 11th that eight countries in the North Atlantic Group have announced their intention to increase their military budgets for the coming year. The new annual military budget recently proposed by the British government has increased to more than 1.6 billion pounds. The French government's new annual military budget reached more than 1.6 trillion francs. France also hurriedly carried out an atomic device explosion.

In this frenzy of arms expansion and war preparation, where can one find even a trace of a "disarmament wish"?

At the same time, with the support of the United States, West German militarists have arrogantly begun to expand their military power abroad. West Germany is realizing its plan to establish twelve ground divisions this year, and is preparing to further expand to twenty-four divisions. Recently, with the support of the United States, it colluded with Spain to arrange the establishment of West German military bases in Spain. Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama also bluntly stated in the Diet on the 11th that if comprehensive and thorough disarmament were carried out, it would violate the newly concluded US-Japan military alliance treaty. This alliance is accelerating Japan's nuclear armament. Isn't it clear what the United States is really "wholeheartedly committed to" when it is cultivating two new sources of war in the East and the West?

At present, the Western Five are finalizing the "joint plan" that the West will put forward at the conference in Paris, but US Secretary of State Herter announced the basic principles of the Western plan in a speech as early as February 18. In this speech, Herter did not put forward any practical measures in terms of banning atomic weapons, abolishing foreign military bases, or reducing armed forces, but insisted on establishing "arms supervision." Advocating this "arms supervision," which is solely for collecting military intelligence from other countries without disarmament, is the old trick that the United States has consistently used to undermine disarmament negotiations for more than a decade. Herter also trumpeted that in order to achieve this "arms supervision," it is "very necessary" to "continue and effectively implement our (US) and the free world's other military plans." Isn't it obvious what kind of "disarmament" plan will be formulated based on Herter's principles?

It is worth noting that before the disarmament conference has even begun, Herter and his assistant, Burden, etc., are already making every effort to promote that the new disarmament negotiations are "not a short-term task" and "can be imagined to last for several years." Their intentions are obvious.

### 裁军会议前夕西方扩军忙  美英法等五国正在拼凑阻挠裁军的“联合方案”

    裁军会议前夕西方扩军忙
    美英法等五国正在拼凑阻挠裁军的“联合方案”
    据新华社12日讯　东西方十国裁军委员会将在15日开始在日内瓦举行会议。苏联去年9月就已提出全面彻底裁军的建议，今年1月又决定再次单方面裁减武装部队一百二十万人，苏联这些主动促进普遍裁军的重大步骤受到了全世界公众的热烈欢迎。现在，日内瓦裁军谈判能否取得进展，关键完全在于以美国为首的西方国家的态度。
    但是美国和其他西方国家怎样在迎接新的裁军谈判呢？
    虽然艾森豪威尔最近再三在说“美国专心致志于不懈地谋求有着消除猜疑和恐惧的保证的、真正的裁军”，但就是他自己提出了美国下一财政年度高达四百五十五亿多美元的直接军事开支预算。美国国防部长盖茨10日又声称，如有需要还“一定会毫不犹豫地建议增加”军事预算。美国还正在集中力量发展洲际导弹，加紧在海外建立导弹基地网，8日又宣布立即增派两个导弹营去西欧。美国总统并且已经声明，美国今后有随时恢复核武器试验的自由，美国武装部队今后一年内将继续保持目前的水平。
    美国还对整个北大西洋集团提出了今后十年加强备战的规划。依据规划，美国的北大西洋集团军队总司令诺斯塔德新近宣布，一年内将在西欧建立起一支新的多国联合原子突击部队。诺斯塔德11日向美国国会报告，北大西洋集团里已经有八国宣布打算增加今后一年的军事预算。英国政府最近提出的新年度军费预算，增加到十六亿多英镑。法国政府新年度军事预算达一万六千多亿法郎。法国还急忙进行了原子装置爆炸。
    在这种扩军备战的狂热中，那儿能找到“裁军心愿”的半点影子呢？
    同时，在美国支持下，西德军国主义者已嚣张地开始向外军事扩张。西德正在实现今年内建立十二个地面师的计划，还准备进一步扩充到二十四个师。最近它并在美国支持下，同西班牙勾结一起安排在西班牙建立西德的军事基地。日本外务相藤山11日在国会里也不讳言，如果全面彻底裁军，就会违反新缔结的美日军事同盟条约。这个同盟正在加速着日本的核武装。美国一手在东西方培育着这样两个新战争策源地，难道不也清楚说明美国真正“专心致志于”什么吗？
    目前西方五国正在巴黎最后拼凑西方将在会议中提出的“联合方案”，但是美国国务卿赫脱早在2月18日发表的演说里，就已宣布了西方方案的基本原则。赫脱在这篇演说里，丝毫也没有提出禁止原子武器、取消外国军事基地、裁减武装部队等方面的任何实际措施，而一味要建立“军备监督”。主张这种没有裁军而专门为了搜集别国军事情报的“军备监督”，正是美国十多年来一贯用来破坏裁军谈判的老手法。赫脱并且鼓吹，为了实现这种“军备监督”，“非常必要”“继续和有效地执行我们（美国）的和自由世界其他的军事计划”。根据赫脱这样的原则拟订出来的方案将会是怎样的“裁军”方案，这不很明显吗？
    值得注意的是，裁军会议尚未开始，赫脱和他的助手伯丁等已经在竭力宣传，新的裁军谈判“不是一个短期任务”，“可以想像得到会持续数年”。他们的用心是昭然若揭的。
