Xinhua News Agency dispatches: According to reports, the Cuban Ministry for the Recovery of Stolen Property took over the American-owned Soledad Sugar Mill, Los Caños Sugar Mill, Isabel Sugar Mill and the Guantanamo Railway in Guantanamo on the 10th.

The Cuban people were overjoyed by this takeover, because these enterprises, under the protection of the Batista tyranny, violated the law and trampled on the workers. These sugar mills, belonging to the Guantanamo Sugar Company, produced 530,867 bags of sugar (each bag weighing 250 pounds) in 1958, and they leased 946.2 caballerias of land. It is estimated that the value of these sugar mills is 10 million pesos.

These sugar mills and railways will be managed by the National Land Reform Committee.

The total number of sugar mills now managed by the National Land Reform Committee is thirty-one. Despite the imperialists' prediction that the output of the sugar mills controlled by the revolutionary government would decline, and their frantic burning of sugarcane fields, contrary to their wishes, as of February 29, sugar mills across Cuba had produced 2,087,169 long tons of sugar, an increase of 800,000 tons over the same period in 1959.

At the same time, the General Secretary of the trade union of workers at the Guantanamo American Naval Base revealed the provocations often carried out by the American military authorities at the base for questionable purposes. When the people held rallies in Guantanamo City, the American troops on the base even equipped themselves with machine guns and cannons, threatening the Cuban people. American Lieutenant Thomas once said insidiously that they were afraid of the kind of sabotage and demonstrations that had occurred in the Panama Canal Zone. In addition, Cubans at this American base are often treated with hostility, and they are frequently subjected to inspection and surveillance.

In addition, according to a report in a Havana newspaper on the 4th, the Cuban National Land Reform Committee, in accordance with the Land Reform Law, took over five large estates in Oriente Province, with a total land area of 2,341 caballerias. Among them, the "Calabaza" farm owns 1,724 caballerias of land.

At the same time, the Ministry for the Recovery of Stolen Property also ordered the takeover of the San Pablo Sugar Mill and the Amazon Sugar Mill in order to investigate the corruption that occurred there during the Batista regime. The Ministry for the Recovery of Stolen Property appointed the National Land Reform Committee as the receiver for these two sugar mills. The total number of sugar mills currently managed by the National Land Reform Committee has reached twenty-eight.

Xinhua News Agency dispatches: A joint meeting presided over by Cuban Prime Minister Castro with leaders of the National Land Reform Committee and the National Sugar Workers' Union, which began on the 3rd, ended on the morning of the 8th. The meeting decided to organize approximately four hundred cooperatives in the national sugarcane growing areas.

Each cooperative will occupy one hundred caballerias of land and have an output of three million arrobas (each arroba equals 22.676 jin). According to statistics, 1.6 billion arrobas of sugarcane are produced by workers on existing large sugarcane plantations.

The leadership of the sugarcane cooperatives will be composed of five members representing sugarcane workers, tenant farmers, sugar mills, the Revolutionary Army, and the National Land Reform Committee.

The National Land Reform Committee will provide various assistance in order to obtain the highest yield in the smallest area, and plans to increase sugarcane production sixfold by adopting modern technology and tapping the enthusiasm of the workers. The National Bank has allocated a fund of 40 million pesos for this year's sugarcane planting.

The meeting also decided to take some organizational measures, such as adapting the trade union organization of the National Sugar Workers' Union to the division of agricultural development zones by the National Land Reform Committee. In addition, the National Land Reform Committee will select some experienced sugar industry worker leaders to serve in the sugar industry aspects of the National Land Reform Committee's work.

Cuba's sugarcane planting area is 180,000 caballerias (one caballeria is equivalent to 201.45 mu), accounting for 40% of Cuba's cultivated land area, and it is all the most fertile land. Thirteen large American sugar companies occupy 87,000 caballerias of land, accounting for 47.4% of the sugarcane field area. The Land Reform Law stipulates that in no case shall the area of sugarcane fields owned by a natural person or legal entity exceed one hundred caballerias. In addition, joint-stock companies whose stocks are not held by Cuban citizens shall not operate sugarcane farms.

    古巴接管一批美国糖厂
    在甘蔗种植区将组织约四百个合作社
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：古巴恢复失窃财产部在10日下午接管了美国在关塔那摩的索莱达德糖厂、洛斯卡尼奥斯糖厂、伊萨维耳糖厂和关塔那摩的铁路。
    古巴人民对这次接管感到欢天喜地，因为这些企业，曾在巴蒂斯塔暴政的庇护下违反法律和蹂躏工人。属于关塔那摩糖公司的这些糖厂在1958年生产了五十三万零八百六十七袋糖（每袋重二百五十磅），它们租种的土地有九百四十六点二卡瓦耶里亚。据估计，这些糖厂的价值为一千万比索。
    这些糖厂和铁路将由土地改革全国委员会来管理。
    现在由土地改革全国委员会管理的糖厂总共有三十一个。尽管帝国主义者预言革命政府所掌握的榨糖厂的产量要下降，并且疯狂地焚烧甘蔗田，但是，同他们的愿望相反，到2月29日为止，古巴全国的糖厂已经制成了二百零八万七千一百六十九长吨糖，比1959年同期的产量增加了八十万吨。
    与此同时，关塔那摩美国海军基地的工人工会总书记揭露了这个基地的美国军事当局常常以可疑的目的进行的挑衅。当人民在关塔那摩城举行集会的时候，基地上的美国军队甚至装备了机关枪和大炮，对古巴人民进行威胁。美国中尉托马斯曾经阴险地说，他们害怕在基地上发生像在巴拿马运河区发生的那种破坏和示威游行。此外，在这个美国基地上的古巴人还常常遭到敌视的对待，他们经常受到检查和监视。
    此外，据哈瓦那报纸4日报道，古巴土地改革全国委员会根据土地改革法在奥连特省接管了五个大庄园，土地面积共达二千三百四十一卡瓦耶里亚。其中的“卡拉瓦萨”农庄拥有土地一千七百二十四卡瓦耶里亚。
    同时，恢复失窃财产部还下令接管圣帕夫洛糖厂和亚马逊糖厂，以便调查巴蒂斯塔统治期间在那里发生的贪污罪行。恢复失窃财产部指定土地改革全国委员会为这两个糖厂的接管者。目前由土地改革全国委员会管理的糖厂总共达到了二十八个。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：由古巴总理卡斯特罗主持的有土地改革全国委员会和全国糖业工人联合会领导人参加的联席会议从3日开始，到8日上午结束。会议决定在全国甘蔗种植区组织大约四百个合作社。
    每个合作社占地一百卡瓦耶里亚，有产量三百万阿罗瓦（每阿罗瓦等于二十二点六七六市斤）。据统计，有十六亿阿罗瓦甘蔗是由现有的甘蔗大庄园的工人生产的。
    甘蔗合作社的领导机构将由代表蔗糖工人、佃农、糖厂、起义军和土地改革全国委员会的五个委员组成。
    土地改革全国委员会将提供各种帮助，以便在最小面积上获得最高的产量，计划通过采用现代化的技术和发挥工人的热情，把甘蔗生产提高六倍。国家银行已经为今年的甘蔗种植拨给了四千万比索的基金。
    会议还决定采取一些组织措施，如使全国糖业工人联合会的工会组织适应于全国土地改革委员会对农业开发区的划分。此外土地改革全国委员会将在经验丰富的糖业工人领导人中间选择一些人担任土地改革全国委员会糖业方面的工作。
    古巴甘蔗种植面积达十八万卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚合二百零一点四五亩），相当于古巴耕地面积的40％，而且都是最肥沃的土地。十三家美国大糖业公司占有土地八万七千卡瓦耶里亚，即占甘蔗田面积的47．4％。土地改革法规定：在任何情况下一个自然人或法人所拥有的蔗田面积不得超过一百卡瓦耶里亚。此外，股票不是由古巴公民持有的股份公司不得经营甘蔗园。
