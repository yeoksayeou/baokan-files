Cuban Folk Songs

In the Cuban countryside, peasant singers strum their guitars, improvising as they sing. The lyrics are often a series of couplets, similar to our "Xin Tian You" folk songs. Below are some original lyrics that I heard, and what the farmers sang and said, compiled in this format.

	Years of bitter experiences have taught me what life is,
	Harvesting sugarcane only provides three months of work, how do we survive the nine-month "dead season"!
	I am the father of five children,
	How can we survive without a roof over our heads!
	Golden tobacco (note) hides from dust and sand in fine gauze tents,
	My children endure wind and rain in dilapidated shacks.
	The landlord drove me off the land,
	Batista sent me to prison.
	Having left my loved ones, where have you wandered off to?
	Some insects spin silk to make clothes for people until they die,
	Some insects wait for people to die before they devour them completely!
	I can't explain the great principles of land reform clearly,
	In the past, I ate corn kernels,
	Now I eat rice.
	In the past, gun muzzles pointed at me, forcing me to leave,
	This year, I aim the gun muzzle at arsonist dogs.
	American, if you dare to come, we'll drive you out,
	Victory will certainly be mine, definitely not yours!

(Note) Golden tobacco is a famous product of Cuba. During cultivation, large gauze tents are erected to cover it, to prevent dust and sand from harming it.
		(Li Bingquan, compiled)

    古巴民歌
    在古巴的农村里，农民歌手弹着六弦琴（吉他），随编随唱，歌词常是一个排句，好像我国的“信天游”。下面把听到的一些歌词的原句和农民唱的、讲的，按这形式编写出来。
    多少年辛酸的遭遇，使我懂得什么是生活，
    收割甘蔗只作三个月工，那九个月的“死季”怎样捱过！
    我是五个孩子的父亲，
    头上没有屋顶怎样生存！
    金黄烟草（注）在细纱帐里躲避尘砂，
    我的孩子们在烂草棚里让风吹雨打。
    老爷把我赶出土地，
    巴蒂斯塔送我进监狱。
    离开了我的亲人啊，你们流浪到哪儿去？
    有的虫儿到死还吐丝给人作衣裳，
    有的虫儿等人死了还要把他吃得精光！
    我说不清土地改革的大道理，
    从前我吃玉米的花，
    现在我吃大米。
    往年枪口对着我逼我走，
    今年我把枪口对准放火的狗。
    美国佬你敢来，就把你打出去，
    胜利的准是我，决不是你！
    （注）金黄烟草是古巴的名产，种植时搭起大片的纱帐覆盖，以防尘砂侵害。
