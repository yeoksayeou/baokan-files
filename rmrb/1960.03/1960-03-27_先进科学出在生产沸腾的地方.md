Advanced science is born in the fertile soil of boiling production and construction; wherever production and construction boil, new sciences are bound to emerge. Boiling production and construction do not belong to capitalist countries, but to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to our new China. This is determined by the superiority of the socialist system, by the socialist economic laws, and by the non-antagonistic contradiction between productivity and production relations under the socialist system.

The "New Theory of Continental Oil Generation Proposed by the Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" published in today's newspaper, as well as some other scientific achievements published recently, such as the new problem of carbon nutrition in crops discovered in the summary of agricultural high-yield experience—crop roots can absorb biogas, and some new theories of mineral geology derived from the data provided by large-scale underground resource exploration and development, their significance lies not only in the development of science itself, not only in the guiding role it already plays or can play in my country's production and construction, but also in the fact that they demonstrate with concrete facts the law that "advanced science always appears where production boils"; they demonstrate the truth that Engels said, "the occurrence and development of production is determined by production from the beginning"; these eloquent facts can inspire scientific workers: go to places where production boils to find research topics!

Some scientific workers used to bury themselves in foreign literature to find research topics. But what makes them distressed is that it is often difficult to find fresh research topics in foreign literature that meet the needs of my country's production and construction, or if they find topics that suit them, they are often the cold leftovers of foreigners. The way to get rid of this distress is to face the boiling production.

It does not mean that we should not pay attention to international scientific literature, but that it is very important to pay attention to the literature. The literature helps us understand the current international scientific development and trends. But what determines the research direction and specific actions of our scientific workers is more importantly the requirements and problems raised by production practice.

In today's newspaper, the communication "From Artillery Regiment Commander to Scientific Leading Cadre" introduces Comrade Wang Jiansheng. Why was he able to successfully lead scientific research work in just over a year after being transferred from the army to a scientific institution? One of his magic weapons is to firmly remember the Party's instructions—to face production and let science serve production. Therefore, he has a pair of bright eyes. As soon as he walked into the Institute of Geology, he noticed an "abnormal" phenomenon: why doesn't everyone talk about mines in this geological research institution? So, with the support of the Party Committee, he put forward the research direction of facing production and insisted on this direction with the masses, which made the work achieve remarkable results.

On our land, there is boiling production and construction everywhere, so new scientific undertakings are appearing or will inevitably appear everywhere. Vigorously carrying out artificial rainfall has promoted the establishment of cloud and fog physics; on the basis of a large number of soil surveys, a classification system for cultivated soil has been established; the theory of "soil and fertilizer compatibility" has been put forward from the summary of agricultural high-yield experience, etc., which are all powerful proofs. At the same time, there are more scientific problems in my country's rich production practice that need to be studied and solved by scientific workers. For example, the data and data accumulated in a large number of blasting projects in various places in recent years are breeding new blasting theories; the experience of close planting of crops inspires botanists to use the new viewpoint of "population physiology" to study plant physiology.

Boiling production provides us with batches of new scientific problems, research clues, signs, data and data. People engaged in scientific research should cherish this priceless asset and must not turn a blind eye to them; must not let them slip past us. If we can do this, our scientific workers will have infinitely broad ideas; they will have inexhaustible research topics and materials.

Boiling production incubates advanced science, and advanced science will inevitably guide production to a higher level. In our socialist society, the relationship between the two is a never-ending spiral cycle. As long as our scientific personnel resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party and work hard along the correct path, my country's scientific undertakings will surely leap to the forefront of world science in the near future, and will never fall behind!

    先进科学出在生产沸腾的地方
    新初
    沸腾的生产建设是孕育先进科学的沃土；什么地方生产建设沸腾，什么地方便一定会出现新兴的科学。沸腾的生产建设不属于资本主义国家，而是属于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，属于我们新中国，这是由社会主义制度的优越性、由社会主义的经济法则、社会主义制度下生产力与生产关系没有对抗性矛盾所决定的。
    本报今天发表的“中国科学院兰州地质研究所提出的陆相生油新理论”以及最近以来发表的一些别的科学成果，例如在总结农业丰产经验中发现的作物炭素营养中的新问题——作物根部可以吸收沼气，以及根据大规模地下资源勘探开发提供的资料而得出的一些矿物地质的新理论等，它们的意义，不仅在于发展了科学本身，不仅在于它对我国生产建设已经或者可以起指导作用，而且在于它们以具体事实论证了“先进的科学总是出现在生产沸腾的地方”这个规律；论证了恩格斯说的“生产的发生和发展从开始起便由生产所决定的”这个真理；这些雄辩的事实可以启示科学工作者：到生产沸腾的地方去找寻研究课题！
    曾经有一些科学工作者，他们习惯于埋头到外国文献中去寻找研究课题。但使他们苦恼的是，外国文献中往往找不到新鲜的、切合我国生产建设需要的研究课题，或者找到了合乎自己的课题，也往往是外国人剩下的冷骨头。摆脱这种苦恼的办法就是面向沸腾的生产。
    决不是说不要留意国际科学文献，而是很需要留意文献。文献有助于我们了解当前国际科学发展情况和动向。但是决定我们科学工作者的研究方向和具体行动的，更重要的是生产实际提出的要求和问题。
    今天本报发表的“从炮兵团长到科学领导干部”这篇通讯中介绍的王建生同志，为什么在从部队转业到科学机关仅仅一年多的时间里，就能够成功地领导科学研究工作？他的一个法宝就是牢牢记着党的指示——面向生产，科学为生产服务。因此，他就会有一对明亮的眼睛，一走进地质研究所，就觉察到一个“不对劲”的现象：在这个地质研究机关里为什么大家不谈矿呢？于是他就在党委的支持下提出了面向生产的研究方向，并且和群众一起坚持这个方向，使工作获得了卓越的成绩。
    在我们的国土上，到处有沸腾的生产建设，因而到处出现着或者必将出现新兴的科学事业。大搞人工降水促进了云雾物理的建立；在大量土壤普查的基础上，建立了耕作土壤的分类系统；从总结农业丰产经验中提出了“土肥相溶”的理论等等，都是有力的证明。同时，我国丰富的生产实践中还有更多的科学问题有待于科学工作者去研究解决。例如近年来各地大量爆破工程中积累的资料和数据正孕育着新的爆破理论；农作物的密植经验启发植物学家用“群体生理”的新观点去研究植物生理。
    沸腾的生产为我们提供着一批又一批的新的科学问题、研究线索、苗头、资料和数据。搞科学研究的人们，要珍贵这一份无价的财产，切勿对它们熟视无睹；切勿让它们在我们面前溜过去。能够这样，我们科学工作者就会有无限开阔的思路；就会有取之不竭的研究课题和材料。
    沸腾的生产孵育出先进的科学，先进的科学又必然会引导生产走向更高的水平。在我们社会主义社会里，这两者的关系是一个永不停止的螺旋式的循环。只要我们科学人员坚决依靠党的领导，沿着正确的道路努力工作，我国的科学事业必然会在不远的将来跃居世界科学的前列，而且永不掉队！
