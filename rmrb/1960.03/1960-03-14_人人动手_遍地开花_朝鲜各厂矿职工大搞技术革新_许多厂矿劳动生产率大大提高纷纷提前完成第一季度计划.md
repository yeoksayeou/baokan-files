Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 11th. The Korean working class, riding the "Chollima" (Thousand-Li Horse), is vigorously engaged in technical innovation on all fronts of socialist construction. With everyone participating and blossoming everywhere, labor productivity has rapidly increased. Many factories and mines have already completed their first quarter production plans ahead of schedule.

The Huichon Precision Machinery Factory, tasked with producing six thousand rock drills for various mines this year, has seen its monthly rock drill output jump from over four hundred to one thousand in the first two months of this year due to technical innovations. This factory had already completed its first quarter production plan ahead of schedule by March 5th. The factory recently adopted over sixty rationalization proposals for technical innovation. One of these is a cylindrical lathe tool collectively created by the lathe operators. Using it to process an important part of the rock drill has increased efficiency fourfold.

The Kiyang Machinery Factory, which plays an important role in agricultural mechanization, is to produce three thousand tractors this year for supply to the countryside. Walking into this factory, one sees innovation success reports and new machines, jigs, and tools manufactured by the workers everywhere. From July of last year to January of this year, the factory launched a campaign of "One Invention or Creation per Person." During this period, workers manufactured more than 180 various metal-cutting machine tools and over 25,000 tools and jigs. Technical innovation and invention have enabled this factory to develop from being able to produce only general agricultural machinery to being able to manufacture tractors in large quantities. Kim Eui-kyung, an innovation expert at this factory, implemented thirty-six technical innovations last year, and has implemented eight more in the first two months of this year. The automated machine for rolling oil filter cleaning plates that he recently manufactured replaced manual operation. Operating this machine for only two weeks can produce enough products to supply the factory for a year. Kim Jeong-cheol of the tool workshop recently invented a vibration-preventing flat-shaving lathe tool that doubles the cutting efficiency.

Workers in the steel sector are also enthusiastically carrying out technical innovation movements. The Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works adopted fifty-seven rationalization proposals for technical innovation in the first two months of this year. The device invented by worker Lee Won-hee to remove tar from the ascension pipes of coke ovens can save more than 2,500 man-days per year compared to manual labor. Recently, mechanical factories have widely launched a high-speed cutting campaign of cutting at 100 meters per minute, and have widely adopted new technologies such as high-speed powerful cutting methods. Some machine tools have reached a level of cutting at 530 meters per minute. The processing volume per machine tool at the Rakwon Machinery Factory is currently double that of the same period last year.

Miners fighting underground are also innovating production technology. Park Ki-hoon, a miner at the Daeyudong Mine, recently adopted an automatic drilling machine and a side water injection machine, increasing the drilling speed per shift from 1.2 meters to 1.9 meters. This mine plans to fully promote this machinery by the end of March. The workers of the entire mine are determined to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule before the fifteenth anniversary of Korea's liberation on August 15th this year.

    人人动手　遍地开花
    朝鲜各厂矿职工大搞技术革新
    许多厂矿劳动生产率大大提高纷纷提前完成第一季度计划
    新华社平壤11日电　骑上“千里马”的朝鲜工人阶级，在社会主义建设的各条战线上大闹技术革新，人人动手，遍地开花，迅速提高了劳动生产率。有不少厂矿已经提前完成了第一季度的生产计划。
    今年担负着为各矿山生产六千台凿岩机的任务的熙川精密机器厂，由于进行了技术革新，在今年头两个多月内，凿岩机的月产量就由四百多台跃增到一千台。这家工厂到3月5日为止，已经提前完成了第一季度的生产计划。这家工厂最近采纳了六十多项关于革新技术的合理化建议。其中有一项是车工们集体创造的一种圆筒形车刀，用它来加工凿岩机的一个重要部件，效率提高了四倍。
    在农业机械化的工作中担当着重要任务的岐阳机械厂，今年要生产三千台拖拉机供应农村。走进这家工厂，到处看到革新喜报和工人们制造出来的新机器、新卡具和工具。这家工厂从去年7月到今年1月的七个月中，开展了“一人有一件发明创造”的运动。在这期间，工人们制造出一百八十多台各种金属切削机床和二万五千多件工具和卡具。技术革新和发明创造使这家工厂由只能生产一般农业机械发展到能够大量制造拖拉机。这家工厂的革新能手金义景在去年一年进行了三十六项技术革新以后，今年头两个月中又实行了八项革新。他最近制造的轧制滤油清净板的一架自动化机器代替了过去的手工操作，只要把这架机器开动两个星期，它所制造的产品就可以供工厂用一年。工具车间的金正杰最近发明的防止震动平削车刀使切削效率提高了一倍。
    钢铁部门的工人们也热烈开展技术革新运动。金策制铁所的职工今年头两个月采用了五十七项关于技术革新的合理化建议。工人李元希发明的清除炼焦炉上的升管中的焦油的装置，比过去的手工劳动一年可以节省二千五百多个人工。各机械工厂最近广泛展开了每分钟切削一百米的高速切削运动，广泛采用高速强力切削法等新技术，有的机床达到每分钟切削五百三十米的水平。乐元机械厂目前每台机床的加工量比去年同期提高了一倍。
    战斗在地下的矿工也在革新生产技术。大榆洞矿山矿工朴基勋最近采用了自动掘进机和侧面注水机，使每班掘进速度由一点二米提高到一点九米。这个矿山要在3月底以前全部推广这种机械。全矿的工人们决心在今年“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年纪念日以前提前完成今年的生产计划。（附图片）
