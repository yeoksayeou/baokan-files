Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd. The heroic people of Shandong, while preventing spring drought, are widely digging water sources to prevent summer drought. At present, the province has invested 8.55 million laborers in drought resistance and prevention. As of the 13th, more than 51 million mu of wheat and spring fields have been irrigated, and more than 60 million mu have been topdressed. Since the province's drought resistance efforts, newly built water conservancy projects have expanded the irrigation area by more than 4 million mu.

In order to pay attention to preventing summer drought while fighting spring drought, all localities resolutely implemented the six principles put forward by the Provincial Party Committee: 1. Both surface water and groundwater should be used, with groundwater as the main focus; use river water, spring water, well water, and all possible runoff water first, and then reservoir water. 2. Ensure that wheat water use is the main priority, and appropriately take care of spring field water use. 3. Combine watering with moisture conservation, watering while conserving moisture, watering and conserving moisture. 4. Grasp both opening up water sources and conserving water. 5. All irrigation areas, especially large and medium-sized irrigation areas, should establish scientific management plans and water use systems. 6. Combine water conservancy projects with drought resistance irrigation, with projects serving and submitting to drought resistance. All localities have widely adopted measures such as diverting river water, lifting well water, pumping pit water; using wells if available, digging wells if not, and digging if water is scarce; diverting if possible, lifting if not, and conserving water and irrigating rationally, in every possible way to expand the irrigation area. In the Linyi area, Tancheng, Junan, Ju counties and other seven counties organized a professional team of 450,000 people to excavate new water sources. They expanded the irrigation area by more than 800,000 mu by digging wells, digging springs, and damming rivers. Wudi County adopted methods such as "digging rivers in rivers, digging ditches in ditches, digging bays in bays, and setting springs in wells", expanding the irrigation area by more than 70,000 mu. Many places have also adopted scientific management systems for water use. After Cao County Chengguan Commune established a system, it ensured that every canal was managed and every gate was watched. The four party committee secretaries of the commune led 67 cadres to take charge of the main canal, more than 330 brigade cadres took charge of the branch canal, and more than 130 team cadres took charge of the farm canal, so that no water ran, no seepage occurred, and every drop of water returned to the fields. This not only saved water and expanded the irrigation area, but also accelerated the progress of drought resistance and spring irrigation.

Under the principle of ensuring that wheat water use is the main priority and appropriately taking care of spring field water use, the province has also launched a magnificent upsurge of seizing opportunities to plow, rake, and spring irrigate to preserve soil moisture. As of the 13th, the province had cultivated more than 14.8 million mu of land, harrowed and raked more than 49 million mu, supported sweet potato ridges more than 11 million mu, and hoeed wheat more than 34.9 million mu. Penglai County adopted the method of watering while conserving moisture, and watering and conserving moisture, and put forward a set of scientific management measures for wheat field management: six procedures of correcting (correcting ridges), applying (topdressing), pressing (rolling), watering (irrigating), treating (treating diseases and insect pests), and planing (loosening the soil), which greatly accelerated the progress of soil loosening and moisture preservation in the county's wheat fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd. The drought resistance and spring irrigation movement in Shanxi Province is tremendous. From the ancient Great Wall outside Yanmen Pass to Fenglingdu on the Yellow River, from Niangziguan to the Luliang Mountains, from the Jinzhong Basin to the Jinan Plain, there are crowds of people everywhere fighting drought and striving for a bumper harvest. Under the slogan of "rivers are cut off, wells are drained, and harvest depends on people, not on heaven; wheat is guaranteed a bumper harvest without rain, and autumn fields are guaranteed complete seedlings without rain," the members of the people's communes in various places are fighting tirelessly in the vast fields, waging unremitting struggles against the drought demon. As of March 13, the province's spring irrigation area had reached 8.1 million mu, of which 4 million mu of winter wheat had been watered with returning green water. The province's daily progress of spring irrigation has increased from 50,000 mu in early February to 490,000 mu, which is twelve times larger than the spring irrigation area in the same period in 1959. Nearly 40 million mu of land has been treated with harrowing, rolling, pressing and other moisture conservation treatments. The Jinan area, which has a faster irrigation progress, has now spring irrigated 3.05 million mu. All the wheat seedlings that have drunk spring water are growing lush and green.

This year's drought resistance struggle has once again demonstrated the powerful power of the people's communes to overcome natural disasters. Because the people's communes have a large organizational scale and can uniformly allocate labor, all localities are doing well in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and other preparatory work while carrying out drought resistance and spring irrigation. According to statistics, the province has completed more than 2,000 small reservoirs; twenty continued large and medium-sized reservoirs will also be basically completed, and some have been put into production. After entering the spring, the spring plowing and drought resistance entered a tense stage. The people's communes in the province re-arranged the labor force for water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and seed selection. While establishing professional teams in all lines, they transferred a large number of people to strengthen drought resistance and spring irrigation, setting off a high tide of rushing to irrigate, building small reservoirs, and digging wells to resist drought. After unified arrangement of labor force in the Jin southeast area, 233 reservoirs were renovated one after another, and more than 4,000 canals were opened, realizing that each reservoir was equipped, each canal was unblocked, and the benefiting area was expanded by 230,000 mu.

In the drought resistance struggle of thousands of troops and horses, the most touching and valuable thing is that the vast number of commune members in various communes have carried forward the noble communist style under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels. All localities in the province broke through the boundaries of communes and districts, pooled their wisdom and efforts, and competed to support each other in terms of labor and materials, and helped each other up and down in terms of water use. The members of Chengguan Commune in Jiexiu County, in the spirit of "giving convenience to others", gave the spring water with a flow of 0.17 to Yitang Commune, expanding the irrigation area by 13,000 mu for Yitang Commune.

"Heaven does not rain, people rain, harvest is determined by people, not by heaven", this is the ambition of the vast number of members of the people's communes in Shanxi. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the people's communes have made tremendous changes in the natural features of Shanxi. The province has 64 irrigation areas with more than 10,000 mu, and has opened 210,000 water wells on arid land. Since the beginning of spring alone, the province has expanded and improved the area of irrigated land by 8 million mu. As a result, the province's water area has soared to 11 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 23rd. People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have launched a large-scale drought prevention and resistance struggle centered on spring irrigation, moisture conservation, and rush repair of water conservancy projects benefiting before spring sowing. By mid-March, the region had spring irrigated more than 3.02 million mu of farmland, an increase of one and a half times compared with the first ten days of the month. After rolling, harrowing, and mulching one to three times, 34.4 million mu of farmland in the region has initially preserved soil moisture. After the large-scale water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring, the region has newly expanded the irrigation area by more than 2 million mu. In addition to the water conservancy projects built over the years, the region's agricultural population has an average of more than three mu of irrigated land per person, which is extremely beneficial for preventing drought, resisting drought, and winning a greater harvest this year. Favorable conditions.

The Party Committee of the Autonomous Region put forward the fighting call of "eliminating spring drought before spring sowing" as early as a month ago, and mobilized members of all ethnic groups to vigorously prevent and fight drought and prepare various materials. In Zhaowuda League, where the drought situation is relatively serious, the people's communes formed a drought prevention and resistance team of more than 310,000 people, and built more than 10,000 water conservancy projects in a concentrated manner. Now, more than 1.02 million mu of land has been irrigated. The Secretary of the CPC Chifeng Municipal Committee and 85 municipal-level cadres went to the communes and production teams to lead drought resistance. More than 2,000 new water conservancy projects were built in the city, and 185,000 mu of land has been irrigated, equivalent to three times the same period last year.

In order to enable water conservancy projects to play a greater role in the drought resistance struggle, the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region timely put forward the call of "grabbing surface water, grasping groundwater, and returning every drop of water to the fields." All localities have carried out project scheduling, investing 70% of the water conservancy construction labor force and a large amount of materials into projects that benefit in the current year, especially projects that benefit before spring sowing, and grasping the work of project supporting facilities, vigorously carrying out activities such as damming rivers to divert water, repairing ponds and building dams, digging wells and extracting springs, and building field projects. At present, more than 23,000 various water conservancy projects have been built in the region, 15,000 various projects have been renovated, and more than 11,000 newly built projects are under construction. The region has stored 1.1 billion cubic meters of water, and the irrigation area has increased by nearly two times compared with the same period last year.

In drought prevention and resistance, all localities have rushed to sow seeds in time. Now most of the agricultural banners and counties in the region have started sowing spring wheat about half a month earlier. As of March 15, the entire autonomous region had sown more than 3.45 million mu of spring wheat, and other early fields had also begun sowing.

In order to support the agricultural drought resistance struggle, the industrial departments in various localities in the autonomous region are rushing to repair and manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery. At present, various factories have manufactured 672 irrigation and drainage machines, 329 Liberation-style waterwheels, and repaired more than 600 irrigation and drainage machines to support rural areas. Factories in various places have also transferred more than 8,000 mechanical workers to the countryside to help farmers repair and install machinery, and trained more than 1,500 farmer drivers to ensure that irrigation and drainage machinery can be put into spring irrigation in time. Although some areas have had spring rains, the drought resistance struggle of the people of all ethnic groups has not slackened in the slightest. (Attached picture)

    山东山西内蒙古人民树立长期抗旱思想
    抗春旱防夏旱确保农业丰收
    组织力量广挖水源，节约用水，扩大春灌面积
    山东
    新华社济南23日电　英雄的山东人民在防春旱的同时，广挖水源，防备夏旱。目前，全省投入抗旱防旱的劳力已达八百五十五万人。到13日止，已浇小麦和春田五千一百多万亩，追肥六千多万亩。全省抗旱以来新修各种水利工程，共扩大灌溉面积四百多万亩。
    为了做到抗春旱时注意防夏旱，各地坚决贯彻了省委提出的六项原则：一、地上水与地下水并用，以地下水为主；先用河水、泉水、井水以及一切可能流掉的水，后用库水。二、保证小麦用水为主，适当照顾春田用水。三、浇水与保墒结合，边浇水，边保墒，又浇水、又保墒。四、开源节流同时抓。五、一切灌区特别是大中型灌区，都建立科学管理计划和用水制度。六、水利工程与抗旱灌溉相结合，工程服从和服务抗旱。各地广泛采取了引河水，提井水，抽坑水；有井用井，无井打井，水少就挖；能引就引，不能引就提，以及节约用水合理灌溉等措施，千方百计地扩大灌溉面积。临沂专区的郯城、莒南、莒县等七个县，共组织了四十五万人的挖掘新水源专业队伍，他们通过打井、挖泉、闸河等办法扩大灌溉面积八十多万亩。无棣县采取了“河中挖河、沟中挖沟、湾中挖湾、井中下泉等办法以后，扩大灌溉面积七万多亩。许多地方在用水上，还采取了科学的管理制度。曹县城关公社订立制度以后，做到渠渠有人管，闸闸有人看。公社的四名党委书记带领六十七名干部包管干渠，三百三十多名大队干部包支渠，一百三十多名小队干部包管农渠，作到不跑水、不渗漏、滴水归田。这样不仅节约用水扩大了灌溉面积，还加快了抗旱春灌的进度。
    在保证小麦用水为主，适当照顾春田用水的原则下，全省还掀起了一个规模壮阔的抢耕抢耙和春灌保墒高潮。到13日止，全省已耕地一千四百八十多万亩，耙耢四千九百多万亩，扶甘薯垅一千一百多万亩，锄小麦三千四百九十多万亩。蓬莱县采取边浇水、边保墒、又浇水又保墒的办法，对麦田管理提出了：正（正畦）、追（追肥）、压（镇压）、浇（浇水）、治（治病虫害）、划（松土）六道工序的一套科学管理措施，使全县的小麦松土保墒工作进度大大加快。
    山西
    新华社太原23日电　山西省的抗旱春浇运动声势巨大。从雁门关外的古长城到黄河边的风陵渡，从娘子关到吕梁山，从晋中盆地到晋南平原，到处都是抗旱夺丰收的人流，在“河斩断、井汲干，丰收靠人不靠天；小麦无雨保丰收，秋田无雨保苗全”的口号下，各地人民公社社员轮番地战斗在广阔的田野上，与旱魔进行不懈的斗争。到3月13日为止，全省春灌面积已达到八百一十万亩，其中有四百万亩冬小麦浇过了返青水。全省春浇日进度，已由2月上旬的五万亩增加到四十九万亩，比1959年同期的春浇面积增大十二倍。还有近四千万亩土地经过耙、耱、压等保墒处理。浇水进度较快的晋南专区现在已经春浇三百零五万亩。所有喝到春水的麦苗，生长一片葱绿。
    今春的抗旱斗争，再一次显示了人民公社战胜自然灾害的强大威力。由于人民公社组织规模大，可以统一调配劳力，各地在抗旱春浇的同时，水利建设、积肥等备耕工作，样样做得好，做在前。据统计，全省已经完工的小型水库有二千余座；二十项续修的大中型水库也将基本竣工，部分已投入生产。入春以后，春耕抗旱进入紧张阶段，全省各人民公社又重新安排了水利、积肥、选种的劳动力，在行行建立专业队的同时，抽调大批人力加强抗旱春浇，掀起了赶浇水、大建小型水库和打井的抗旱高潮。晋东南专区统一安排劳力之后，先后整修了二百三十三座水库，开渠道四千多条，实现了库库配成套，渠渠水畅通，扩大受益面积二十三万亩。
    在千军万马的抗旱斗争中，最感人、可贵的是，各公社广大社员在各级党委统一领导下，发扬了高尚的共产主义风格。全省各地打破社界、区界，群策群力，在劳力和物资方面争相支援，在用水方面上下游互让互助。介休县城关公社社员本着“把方便送给别人”的精神；把零点一七个流量的泉水让给了义棠公社，为义棠公社扩大灌溉面积一万三千亩。
    “天不雨人下雨，丰收由人不由天”，这是山西广大人民公社社员的雄心大志。人民公社在两年大跃进中，已经使山西的自然面貌起了巨大的变化。全省有了万亩以上的灌区六十四处，在干旱的土地上开凿了二十一万眼水井。仅入春以后，全省扩大和改善浇地的面积就有八百万亩。从而使全省的水地面积猛增到一千一百万亩。
    内蒙古
    新华社呼和浩特23日电　内蒙古自治区各族人民展开了以春浇、保墒和抢修春播前受益水利工程为中心的大规模防旱抗旱斗争。到3月中旬，全区已春浇农田三百零二万多亩，比上旬激增一倍半，全区三千四百四十万亩农田经过磙、耙耱一到三遍后，已初步保住墒情。经过去冬今春大规模的水利建设运动，全区新扩大灌溉面积二百多万亩，加上历年来建设的水利工程，全区农业人口平均每人已经有三亩多水浇地，为防旱抗旱、夺取今年更大丰收，创造了极其有利的条件。
    自治区党委早在一个月以前就提出了“把春旱消灭在春播之前”的战斗号召，发动各族社员大力防旱抗旱斗争和各项物资准备工作。在旱情比较严重的昭乌达盟，各人民公社组成三十一万多人的防旱抗旱队伍，突击修建起一万多项水利工程，现在已浇地一百零二万多亩。中共赤峰市市委书记和八十五名市级干部分头深入到公社和生产队领导抗旱，全市新建水利工程二千多项，现在已浇地十八万五千亩，相当于去年同期的三倍。
    为了使水利工程在抗旱斗争中发挥更大效益，自治区党委及时提出了“抢抓地表水，狠抓地下水，滴水归田”的号召。各地都进行了工程排队，将70％的水利建设劳力和大批物力投入当年受益工程，特别是春播前受益工程，并抓紧工程配套工作，大力开展拦河引水、修塘筑坝、打井掏泉和建筑田间工程等活动。目前，全区已建成各种水利工程二万三千多处，整修各种工程一万五千处，还有一万一千多处新建工程正在加紧施工。全区已经蓄水十一亿立方米，灌溉面积比去年同期增加近两倍。
    在防旱抗旱中，各地纷纷提前趁墒播种。现在全区大部分农业旗县都提前半个月左右开始播种春小麦。到3月15日，全自治区已播种春小麦三百四十五万多亩，其他早田也已开始播种。
    为了支援农业抗旱斗争，自治区各地工业部门正在抢修抢制排灌机械。各工厂目前已经制造出各种排灌机械六百七十二部，解放式水车三百二十九台，修理排灌机械六百多部支援农村。各地工厂还抽调了八千多名机械工人下乡帮助农民修理安装机械，训练农民司机一千五百多人，保证排灌机械能及时投入春浇。目前部分地区虽然喜降春雨，但各族人民的抗旱斗争并未稍懈。（附图片）
