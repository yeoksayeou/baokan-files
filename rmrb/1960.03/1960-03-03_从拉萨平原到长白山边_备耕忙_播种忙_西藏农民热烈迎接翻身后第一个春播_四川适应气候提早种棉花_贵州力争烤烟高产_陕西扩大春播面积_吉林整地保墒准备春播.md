Tibet
(Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa) A vigorous and large-scale upsurge in spring plowing preparations has emerged in the vast rural areas of Tibet. Farmers everywhere are welcoming their first spring plowing after complete emancipation with soaring enthusiasm for production.

The vast rural areas of the Tibetan Plateau have begun to thaw. In the Shannan and Lhasa areas, preparations for plowing are being intensified. In the warm climate of the Linzhi and Bomi counties in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, weeping willows are sprouting and budding, and peach trees are budding. Preparations for plowing have ended, and the farmers are actively carrying out spring plowing and sowing. In some areas of Bomi County where planting began as early as January, wheat and highland barley have grown to two or three inches high, and the land is green everywhere.

Last winter, under the leadership of the Farmers' Associations and the newly established large number of agricultural production mutual aid groups, emancipated farmers in various parts of Tibet launched a heated upsurge in winter production, making full preparations for this year's spring plowing in terms of water, soil, and fertilizer. According to statistics from the Shannan Special District, a total of 5.48 billion catties of fertilizer were accumulated in winter, with more than 12,000 catties of fertilizer accumulated per "ke" of land (equivalent to one mu). More than 3,100 li of irrigation canals were repaired and built, more than 290 reservoirs and ponds were built, and the cultivated area was expanded by 74,000 ke. The land was generally plowed two to three times.

Farmers, who in the past could not straighten their backs and dared not breathe loudly on the land of the feudal lords, are now preparing for plowing with beaming faces and loud songs.

Sichuan
(Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu) Various parts of Sichuan are planting cotton early. By mid-February, Jianyang County, a major producing area, had already used warm beds to cultivate seedlings on more than 2,400 mu, and some high-yield fields had already begun transplanting. Shehong County has more than 9,700 warm beds with more than 160,000 catties of cotton seeds sown. The general sowing time is more than 20 days earlier than last year.

Fully utilizing the favorable conditions of Sichuan's mild climate, sowing and raising seedlings early, and striving to set bolls and set more bolls early are important experiences gained in large-scale cotton production last year. In order to achieve early sowing, cotton-producing areas have generally adopted the method of wide-row intercropping. Cotton rows are reserved when sowing small spring crops, which also facilitates ventilation and light transmission and solves the contradiction between grain and cotton land. Vigorously developing high-yield roads and high-yield areas, and carrying out mass high-yield movements are major features of this year's cotton production in Sichuan. The high-yield fields planned for planting in various parts of the province account for about 30% of this year's cotton field area. A vigorous mass movement of planting "Cotton King" is also being carried out throughout the province.

Guizhou
(Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 2nd) Guizhou Province, which is rich in tobacco leaves, is promptly grasping the management of tobacco seedling beds and the preparation for transplanting after overfulfilling the planting plan for flue-cured tobacco, striving to exceed last year's flue-cured tobacco production.

Guizhou Province's planned planting area for flue-cured tobacco this year has expanded by more than 40% compared with last year. By mid-February, the province's tobacco planting had overfulfilled the plan by more than 10%. Guiding County, Zunyi City and other famous flue-cured tobacco producing areas have cultivated a number of reserve seedlings after completing the sowing plan to prevent seedling shortages. At present, the early-planted tobacco seedlings have grown lush and green, with four or five cotyledons; the rest have also generally emerged, and it is expected that transplanting can be started early in early April.

After sowing, all localities immediately grasped the three key links of "checking, supplementing, and managing," established professional teams, and strengthened the management of seedling beds. Through a general survey of seedling beds, additional fertilizer was applied to those with insufficient base fertilizer; seeds were immediately replenished in areas where tobacco seedlings were too sparse. While strengthening the management of seedling beds, people's communes in various places have also started preparations for tobacco planting and curing in advance. The land required for tobacco planting has been basically arranged and implemented in various places, and is currently being deeply plowed and leveled. Zunyi City has also built more than 8,000 drying rooms.

Shaanxi
(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 2nd) Various parts of Shaanxi Province are actively expanding cultivated land to welcome spring planting. Hanzhong Special District and ten counties in Guanzhong have opened up more than 772,000 mu of wasteland without affecting soil and water conservation. The masses in the sandy land areas of Yulin and Yan'an Special Districts in northern Shaanxi are massively diverting water and removing sand, turning barren sand into fertile fields. Yulin County has transformed more than 55,000 mu, of which 30,000 mu have also been greatly leveled, which alone has increased the county's paddy field area by 50% compared with last year.

While reclaiming wasteland and improving the soil, all localities have also paid attention to increasing multiple cropping. For example, Sanyuan County plans to replant more than 90,000 mu of cotton in the summer miscellaneous grain fields that mature earlier. All localities have also made full use of scattered small plots of land to expand the planting area. Many basic construction units have also handed over temporarily unused land to nearby communes for cultivation, giving full play to the potential of the land.

In the preparations for spring planting in Shaanxi Province, the principle of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting has been implemented. While expanding the planting area, all localities have also vigorously developed high-yield plots, striving to increase the yield per unit area. This year, high-yield plots of grain crops in the province will account for 25% to 30% of the grain field area, and nearly half of the cotton fields in the Guanzhong area will be high-yield plots.

Jilin
(Xinhua News Agency, Changchun) People's communes in Jilin Province are plowing and pressing the land early to conserve moisture and prevent drought, in preparation for the upcoming spring plowing production. At present, the progress of land preparation and moisture conservation in various places is very rapid. According to statistics on February 20, the province has prepared 7.2 million mu of land. Baicheng area, which is progressing faster, has already plowed and pressed more than 80% of the autumn-plowed land. All counties have proposed to complete all land preparation work before March 15. The land in various places after plowing and pressing has good soil moisture conditions, creating conditions for early topdressing.

Based on the current situation that the land has not yet completely thawed, all localities have adopted methods such as plowing one layer and harrowing one layer, harrowing the sunny slopes first and then the shady slopes, and harrowing the land in the morning and pressing the land in the afternoon to ensure the quality of land preparation.

    西藏
    据新华社拉萨电  西藏广大农村，出现了声势浩大、规模壮阔的备耕高潮。各地农民正以高涨的生产热情，迎接彻底翻身以后的第一个春耕。
    辽阔的西藏高原农村已经开始解冻。山南、拉萨地区，备耕活动正在加紧进行。雅鲁藏布江下游气候温暖的林芝、波密两县，垂柳发芽抽条，山桃含苞欲放，备耕活动已经结束，农民们?喝着牲口，正在积极进行春耕播种。波密县有些早在1月份播了种的地区，小麦、青稞，已长到两、三寸高，到处一片青绿。
    去年冬天，西藏各地翻身农民在农民协会和刚刚成立起来的大批农业生产互助组的领导下，掀起了热火朝天的冬季生产高潮，在水、土、肥等方面，为今年的春耕生产作了充分的准备。据山南专区的统计，冬季共积肥五十四亿八千多万斤，每克地（相当一亩）积肥一万二千多斤，整修、兴修水渠长达三千一百多里，修水库、池塘二百九十多个，扩大耕地面积七万四千多克，土地普遍翻耕了两次到三次。
    往年在领主土地上被压的腰直不起来，气不敢喘的农民们，现在，眉飞色舞、放声高歌地进行备耕工作。
    四川
    据新华社成都电  四川各地提早播种棉花。到2月中，主要产区的简阳县已用温床育苗二千四百多亩，有些高产田已开始移栽。射洪县共有温床九千七百多个，播下棉子十六万多斤。一般播种时间比去年提早二十多天。
    充分利用四川气候温和的有利条件，早播种、早育苗，争取早结桃、多结桃，是去年各地获得棉花大增产的一项重要经验。为了实现早播，各棉区普遍采用了宽行套种的办法，小春作物播种时即为棉花预留出棉行，这样还便于通风透光和解决粮棉争地的矛盾。大搞高产路、高产片，开展群众性的高产运动，是今年四川棉花生产中的一大特点。全省各地计划种植的高产田，占今年棉田面积30％左右。各地还开展了轰轰烈烈的全民种“棉花王”运动。
    贵州
    据新华社贵阳2日电　盛产烟叶的贵州省在超额完成烤烟播种计划后，及时抓紧烤烟苗床管理和移栽准备工作，力争烤烟产量超过去年。
    贵州省今年烤烟计划种植面积，比去年扩大四成以上。到2月中旬，全省烤烟播种已超额一成多完成计划。著名的烤烟产区贵定县、遵义市等地，在完成播种计划后，又培育了一部分预备苗，以防缺秧。目前种得早的烟苗已长得青葱郁茂，有四、五片子叶；其余的也普遍出土，预计在4月初就可以提早开始移栽。
    在播种后，各地立即抓住“查、补、管”三个环节，建立专业队，加强苗床管理。通过苗床普查，对底肥施得不足的就增施追肥；烟苗过稀的就马上补撒种子。在加强苗床管理同时，各地人民公社都提早展开了栽烟和烘烤的准备工作。各地对种烟所需土地已基本安排落实，目前正在深翻平整。遵义市并建成烘房八千多间。
    陕西
    据新华社西安2日电　陕西省各地积极扩大耕地面积来迎接春播。汉中专区和关中十个县在不影响水土保持的条件下，目前已开出荒地七十七万二千多亩。陕北榆林、延安两专区风沙地带的群众，正在大规模引水拉沙，改荒沙为良田。榆林县已改了五万五千多亩，其中有三万亩还进行了大平整，仅这一项就使全县稻田面积比去年增加50％。
    各地在开荒、改良土壤的同时，还注意了增加复种。如三原县计划在成熟较早的夏杂粮田里再复种棉花九万多亩。各地还充分利用零散小块土地来扩大种植面积。许多基本建设单位也把暂时不用的土地交给附近公社耕种，发挥土地潜力。
    陕西省在春播准备中，贯彻了多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，各地在扩大播种面积的同时还大搞丰产方，力争提高单位面积产量。全省今年粮食作物丰产方将占粮田面积的25％到30％，关中地区棉田将近一半是丰产方。
    吉林
    据新华社长春电  吉林省各人民公社提早耙压土地、保墒防旱，迎接即将到来的春耕生产。目前，各地的整地保墒进度很猛，据2月20日统计，全省已整地七百二十万亩。进度较快的白城地区已经耙压秋耕地80％多。各县提出，要在3月15日前全部结束整地工作。各地经过耙压后的土地，墒情很好，为顶浆早种创造了条件。
    根据当前土地还未全部解冻的情况，各地采取化一层耙一层，先耙阳坡后耙阴坡，上午耙地下午压地等方法，保证整地质量。
