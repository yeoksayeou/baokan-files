Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 20th: According to TASS, the Soviet representative Zorin, who is attending the Geneva Three-Nation Conference on Discontinuing Nuclear Weapons Tests, stated at a press conference on the 19th that the Soviet delegation proposed an important suggestion at the meeting on the 19th, paving the way for the early and certain completion of its task.

Zorin said that, in order to overcome all obstacles to the conclusion of a treaty, the Soviet government is prepared to agree to reach an agreement on the following basis: Concluding a treaty on the cessation of all nuclear weapons tests, including tests in the atmosphere, oceans, and outer space, as well as underground tests producing seismic magnitudes above 4.75.

Since the United States insists that underground explosions with seismic magnitudes below 4.75 cannot be supervised, the Soviet government is prepared to agree to a proposal made by the United States on joint research and experiments by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, provided that the contracting parties jointly guarantee that no nuclear weapons tests producing seismic magnitudes of 4.75 or below will be conducted during this period.

Zorin pointed out at the press conference that the work of drafting the treaty could be said to be nearing completion, and therefore, it is even more intolerable that a treaty has not been concluded after seventeen months of negotiations. The real reason is that certain groups keen on the nuclear arms race, out of military considerations and the desire to freely conduct underground explosions, are obstructing the conclusion of a treaty.

Zorin pointed out that the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons tests proposed by the United States excludes underground nuclear weapons tests producing seismic magnitudes below 4.75. Accepting such a proposal would be tantamount to allowing the legal continuation of nuclear weapons tests under the cover of a superficially grand but actually empty treaty.

Zorin reiterated that the Soviet Union fully adheres to the position stated in the 1958 Geneva Experts Conference report. The Soviet Union does not agree that there are any limits in the detection of underground nuclear explosions. He pointed out, however, that in view of the fact that the United States and the United Kingdom are using this issue to seriously hinder the progress of the conference, in order to remove this obstacle, the Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, put forward the above-mentioned important suggestion. Zorin expressed the hope that this new effort by the Soviet Union will lead to the conclusion of a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons tests without delay.

    在三国不继续核试验会议上
    苏联提出新建议
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦19日讯：出席日内瓦三国不继续核武器试验会议的苏联代表查拉普金19日在记者招待会上发表声明说，苏联代表团在19日的会上提出了一项重要的建议，为会议早日和肯定地完成它的任务铺平了道路。
    查拉普金说，为了克服缔结条约方面的一切障碍，苏联政府准备同意在下面的基础上达成协议：缔结一项关于停止一切核武器试验，包括在大气、海洋和外层空间中的试验以及产生幅度在四点七五地震指数以上的地下试验。
    由于美国坚持说，地震幅度在四点七五以下的地下爆炸无法监督，苏联政府准备同意美国提出的一项关于苏、美、英三国共同进行研究和试验的建议，只要缔约各方共同保证在此期间内不进行任何产生幅度在四点七五地震指数或这个指数以下的核武器试验。
    查拉普金在记者招待会上指出，拟订条约的工作本来可以说已经接近完成，因此，经过十七个月的谈判而仍然没有能够缔结一项条约就更加使人不能容忍。真正的原因是，某些热中于核武器竞赛的集团，出于军事考虑和要求自由地进行地下爆炸，阻挠缔结条约。
    查拉普金指出，美国方面建议签订的禁止核武器试验条约把产生幅度在四点七五地震指数以下的地下核武器试验除外。如果接受这样一个建议，就无异允许在表面堂皇而实际空洞无物的条约掩护下合法地继续进行核武器试验。
    查拉普金重申，苏联完全遵循在1958年日内瓦专家会议报告中所阐明的立场。苏联不同意说在地下核爆炸的侦察方面有什么界限。他指出，但是，鉴于美英两国利用这个问题来严重地妨碍会议的进展，为了扫除这个障碍，苏联代表团奉苏联政府的指示，提出了上述重要建议。查拉普金表示希望，苏联的这一新的努力，将会导致毫不拖延地签订一项禁止核武器试验的条约。
