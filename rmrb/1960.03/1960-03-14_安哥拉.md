    Angola
    Angola is located in the equatorial region of the southern hemisphere of western Africa and is the largest and most important overseas colony of Portugal. It covers an area of 1,246,700 square kilometers, more than thirteen times the size of Portugal itself, with a population of 4,392,000. It has rich mineral resources. The land and climate are suitable for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.
    Portugal began to invade Angola in 1482, but was met with long-term resistance from the Angolan people, and it was not until 1888 that it forcibly occupied Angola.
    Portuguese colonialists have always attempted to suppress the Angolan national independence movement through large-scale immigration and "assimilation" policies, and planned means to eliminate Africans. After occupying Angola, the Portuguese colonialists subjected Africans to the most barbaric economic enslavement and political persecution. Africans had no political rights and no land, and they lived in poverty for generations. In order to maintain its high profits, the Portuguese colonialists still use the "Native Labor Law" formulated in 1929, which stipulates that the colonial authorities can implement forced labor on local Africans. Through so-called "contract laborers" or "free labor laws," the colonial authorities rounded up large numbers (about 380,000) of Africans and drove them to the colonialists' large plantations, mines, or transported them to South Africa. Once the Angolan people left, there was little hope of survival. As a result, large areas of Angola were deserted, but the colonialists extracted huge profits on the basis of the deaths of these Africans. The total net profit of several companies of the colonialists at the end of 1957 reached 334,730,000 escudos (equivalent to 48 billion francs).
    In order to maintain its colonial rule in Angola, the Portuguese colonialists carried out cruel persecution of Africans. They used troops and a large number of police to carry out strict control. Africans in Angola must carry so-called "identity cards," "passes," and a large pile of various documents with fingerprints; Africans cannot contact the outside world. All Africans returning from other colonies were immediately arrested. Anyone who showed dissatisfaction with colonial rule or demanded independence was persecuted; they were either imprisoned or exiled to São Tomé Island. Since last year, many nationalists have been arrested.
    The Portuguese colonialists' brutal rule in Angola has been strongly supported by American imperialism. The United States not only has large investments in Angola but also occupies military bases.
    In recent years, the Angolan people have launched a heroic struggle for independence. In 1956, residents of several villages on the Angolan border rioted against the colonialists. At the same time, mass political organizations of the Angolan people also began to operate. In 1958, the Angolan People's Union was established, and it distributed pamphlets, slogans, and leaflets demanding independence throughout the country. In August 1958, it published a declaration calling on all the people to rise up and demand immediate independence. In early 1959, an anti-colonial riot occurred in Angola, but it was brutally suppressed. However, the Portuguese authorities' terrorist tactics cannot shake the Angolan people's determination to fight for independence, and the flames of new struggles are burning more and more strongly.

    安哥拉
    安哥拉位于非洲西部南半球赤道地区，是葡萄牙在海外最大和最重要的一个殖民地。面积计一百二十四万六千七百平方公里，比葡萄牙本土要大十三倍多；人口四百三十九万二千人。它有丰富的矿产。土地和气候都适宜于发展农牧业。
    葡萄牙在1482年就开始侵入安哥拉，但遭到安哥拉人民的长期反抗，直至1888年才以武力侵占了安哥拉。
    葡萄牙殖民者一直企图通过大规模移民“同化”政策，有计划地消灭非洲人的手段来达到镇压安哥拉民族独立运动的目的。葡萄牙殖民者在占领安哥拉后，就对非洲人进行最野蛮的经济奴役和政治迫害，非洲人没有政治权利，也没有土地，他们世世代代都过着贫困的生活。葡萄牙殖民者为了保持其高额利润，至今仍沿用1929年制定的“土著劳动法”，规定殖民当局可以对当地非洲人实行强迫劳动。殖民当局通过所谓“契约劳工”或“自由劳工法”把大批的（约三十八万）非洲人抓起来赶到殖民者的大种植园、矿山或被输送到南非去。安哥拉人民就一去很少有生还的希望。结果造成了安哥拉大片地区都荒无人烟，但是殖民者就在这非洲人死亡的基础上榨取了大量的利润。殖民者的几家公司在1957年底所得纯利总数达三亿三千四百七十三万埃斯库多（合四百八十亿法郎）。
    葡萄牙殖民者为了保持其在安哥拉的殖民统治，对非洲人进行着残酷的迫害。他们通过军队与大批的警察进行严密的控制。安哥拉的非洲人必须随身携带所谓“身份证”“通行证”和一大堆按有指印等各种各样的证件；非洲人不能与外界联系。所有从其他殖民地回来的非洲人都立即遭到逮捕。任何对殖民统治流露不满情绪或要求独立的人民都遭到迫害；他们不是被关进监狱就被流亡到圣托姆岛。去年以来，就有许多民族主义者被捕。
    葡萄牙殖民者在安哥拉的这种残暴统治得到了美帝国主义的大力支持。美国在安哥拉不仅有大量投资而且占有军事基地。
    安哥拉人民近年来为争取独立展开了英勇的斗争。1956年，在安哥拉边境的几个村庄的居民就发生了反对殖民者的骚动。同时安哥拉人民的群众性政治组织也开始活动起来。1958年，安哥拉人民联盟成立，它在全国各地散发了要求独立的小册子、标语和传单。1958年8月间，它公布了宣言，号召全体人民起来要求立即独立。1959年初，安哥拉曾发生反殖民主义的暴动，但遭到了残酷的镇压。但是，葡萄牙当局的恐怖手段并不能动摇安哥拉人民争取独立的斗志，新的斗争火焰正在日益强烈地燃烧起来。
