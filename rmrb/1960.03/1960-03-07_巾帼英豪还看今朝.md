Heroic Women of Today
Rural Sisters Cherish Pigs Like Treasure
Many Have Become Pig Farmers, Breeders, and Veterinarians

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Chinese rural women have made significant contributions to livestock production, especially in hog raising.

In the past, women also raised pigs, but it was mainly a household affair, mostly done by older women. Since the Party Central Committee pointed out that pigs are the head of the six domestic animals, and people's communes everywhere have been vigorously developing collective raising, "raising pigs is glorious" has become a good social trend, and many young women have joined the ranks of pig raising. Currently, women make up more than 60% of the pig farm workers in many areas. In addition to participating in pig raising with male workers, women in various regions have also independently established a large number of women-run pig farms. According to preliminary statistics from six provinces and regions—Guangxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hebei—and three special districts in Henan (Luoyang), Anhui (Fuyang), and Zhejiang (Wenzhou), there are more than 104,000 women-run pig farms, with more than 900,000 female workers. In these women-run pig farms, all positions, from farm managers to pig farm workers and breeders, are held by women. Shaanxi Province alone has more than 10,900 female pig farm managers.

Rural women love the pig-raising business and have put in hard work to raise more pigs and raise them well. Many female workers regard the pig farm as their home, cherishing the pigs like treasure, staying by their side every day, meticulously feeding them and preventing diseases. The pig pens are cleaned several times a day. When it's cold, they pad the pig pens with straw; when it's hot, they bathe the pigs with cold water during the day and smoke the pig pens at night to drive away mosquitoes. They also reclaim wasteland to grow melons and vegetables, and try every means to find wild plants to solve the pig feed problem. Regardless of wind or rain, they feed the pigs on time to ensure they are full and well-fed. Yang Maoying, a female pig-raising expert in Guizhou Province, has trekked over a hundred hills of all sizes in the vicinity over the years to find wild feed, personally tasting more than a hundred kinds of wild grasses and wild fruits. She has raised more than 400 fat pigs with hardly any grain. Female workers in various regions actively learn collective feeding and management methods, so that the pigs grow fast, reproduce more, and the survival rate of piglets is high, making them not only farm workers but also breeders and veterinarians. Among the female workers in Hunan Province, there are more than 34,000 breeders and veterinarians. The young women of the "Liu Hulan Pig Farm" in Wangjia Production Brigade of Xiyou Commune in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, have all become farm workers, breeders, midwives, veterinarians, and scientific researchers. They have successively learned more than 20 advanced pig-raising technologies, enabling the number of pigs in stock to rapidly increase from 23 in the spring of 1958 to 1,150, and completely eliminating diseases, making it a disease-free pig farm. The twenty-four farm workers of the "March 8th" Women's Pig Farm in Tianma Commune, Songjiang County, Shanghai, are all young women. After learning artificial insemination, the conception rate of sows reached 97.8%, and all the piglets born survived.

Female Warriors in the Sky and on the Ground
Adding an Important Force to National Defense Construction

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Women in the New China have excellently completed various tasks in the ground, naval, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and have made outstanding contributions in the glorious posts of defending the motherland and defending socialist construction, becoming an important force in national defense construction.

The New China's female aviators, who have written a glorious page in the history of Chinese aviation, are rapidly growing under the education of the Party. They have mastered complex aviation science and technology in flying, navigation, communication, mechanics, parachuting, and gliding, and some have also served as flying squadron leaders, squadron leaders, captains, navigation staff officers, and mechanics chiefs. Because they have perseverance and a spirit of hard work, their flying skills are rapidly improving. Lieutenant Qin Guifang is now an "all-weather" pilot; she can take off during the day, return at night, navigate through clouds, and fly safely in the wind and rain. Lieutenant Li Lizhen, who graduated from a certain aviation school in 1958, has now become a female navigator who is familiar with every air route in the country and understands the main landmarks and navigation data on the routes. People affectionately call her a "clever girl" with "three fasts and one accurate" (fast hands, fast eyes, fast mind, and accurate calculation).

On the Fujian front, there is a group of female broadcasters who, year after year, rain or shine, broadcast to the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the islands of Jinmen and others, from forward tunnels or hidden positions, about the glorious achievements of socialist construction in the motherland, our army's lenient policies towards defectors and insurgents, and letters from relatives of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. Broadcaster Chen Feifei has not left her position for eight or nine years. The more the enemy shells, the more vigorously she broadcasts. Sometimes, her broadcasting equipment is damaged, and she braves the shelling to repair it with technicians. Over the years, she has been continuously praised and rewarded.

Female radio operators, telephone operators, and technicians in the military communications work posts of the motherland, female military doctors, nurses, and researchers on the medical front, and female quartermaster workers on the logistics front, have all contributed to the cause of national defense construction over the years.

More and More Female Athletes
26 People Have Broken Eight World Records Eleven Times

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: In the past ten years, the number of women in New China participating in sports has greatly increased, and great achievements have been made in sports. In the three years from 1957 to 1959 alone, 26 female athletes in our country broke eight world records in track and field, parachuting, mountaineering, and shooting eleven times. Other sports such as women's table tennis, speed skating, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, rowing, radio transceiver, and motorcycle cross-country have also reached or approached international levels.

Ten years ago, women in our country had little foundation in sports. However, with the rapid development of socialist construction, the Party and the government have created better and better conditions for carrying out sports, and more and more women are participating in sports.

Today, in our country, thousands of female workers regularly participate in sports activities. For example, many female workers in Beijing Cotton Textile Factories No. 1, 2, and 3 insist on doing broadcast exercises every day. In universities, middle schools, and primary schools, sports have been widely carried out. Female students have all participated in sports activities in schools.

In rural areas, due to collectivization, especially after the people's communes, the vast number of rural women who have been liberated from housework are increasingly participating in sports activities. The talents of women of various ethnic minorities in our country in sports have also been brought into play after liberation.

On such a broad mass foundation, the technical level of women in our country in sports has also made leaps and significant improvements over the past decade. By 1958, more than 670,000 people had reached the standard of graded athletes. Currently, 486 female athletes have obtained the title of Master of Sports.

In track and field, which is the foundation of various sports, our female athletes not only broke all the national records before liberation by 1955, but also created the world record for women's high jump in 1957 by Zheng Fengrong, who was twenty years old at the time, writing a glorious page in the history of sports in our country. The general improvement in the level of track and field in our country was particularly prominent at the First National Games last year.

Although women's parachuting in our country started relatively late, in the two years from 1958 to 1959, 15 female athletes in the country broke the world record for women's group parachuting five times. Women's mountaineering in our country has only been carried out for two years, and in 1959, nine female mountaineers in our country broke the world record for women's mountaineering. In 1959, Chen Rong, a twenty-four-year-old nurse, also broke the world record for women's small-bore rifle fifty and one hundred meters each with thirty shots prone shooting with a score of 589 rings, surpassing the previous record of 588 rings.

The level of sports such as women's table tennis, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, speed skating, rowing, radio transceiver, and motorcycle cross-country in our country has also made great progress in recent years.

    巾帼英豪还看今朝
    农村姊妹爱猪如宝
    许多人成了饲养员、配种员和防疫员
    据新华社6日讯　我国农村妇女在以猪为首的畜牧业生产战线上作出了重大贡献。
    从前妇女也养猪，都是一家一户地经营，而且绝大部分是老年妇女。自从党中央指出猪为六畜之首，各地人民公社大办集体饲养事业以后，“养猪光荣”成了良好的社会风气，许多青年妇女投身到养猪行列，女饲养员人数急剧增加。目前，许多地区的饲养员队伍中，60％以上是妇女。各地妇女除了同男饲养员一起参加养猪以外，还单独建立了大批妇女养猪场。据广西、山东、陕西、湖南、江西、河北六个省区和河南洛阳、安徽阜阳、浙江温州三个专区的初步统计，就有妇女养猪场十万四千多个，女饲养员九十多万人。这些妇女养猪场从场长到饲养员、配种员等，全部由妇女担任，仅陕西省就有女养猪场场长一万零九百多名。
    农村妇女热爱养猪事业，为多养猪、养好猪付出了辛勤的劳动。许多女饲养员视猪场为家，爱猪如宝，天天守候在猪的身边，精心饲养、防疫，猪栏每天都打扫好几次，天冷了给猪栏垫上草，天热了白天用凉水给猪洗澡，晚上在猪栏熏烟给猪驱蚊。她们还开荒种瓜种菜，千方百计寻找野生植物来解决猪的饲料问题，不论刮风下雨，都按时给猪吃饱吃好。贵州省女养猪能手杨茂英，为了寻找野生饲料，几年来踏遍了附近大小百十个山头，亲口尝了一百多种野草野果，几乎没有用粮食，就饲养出四百多头大肥猪。各地女饲养员积极学习集体饲养和管理方法，使猪长得快，繁殖多，仔猪成活率高，做到既是饲养员，又是配种员、防疫员。湖南省女饲养员中，有配种员、防疫员三万四千多名。山东省掖县西由公社王贾生产大队“刘胡兰养猪场”的年轻姑娘们，人人都成了饲养员、配种员、接生员、防疫员和科学研究员。她们先后学会二十多种养猪先进技术，使生猪存栏数由1958年春季的二十三头迅速发展到一千一百五十头，并且完全杜绝了疫病，成为无疫养猪场。上海市松江县天马公社“三八”妇女养猪场的二十四名饲养员，全部是年轻姑娘，她们学会了人工配种以后，母猪的怀胎率达到97．8％，所生仔猪只只成活。
    天上地下都有女战士
    国防建设中增添一支重要力量
    据新华社6日讯　新中国妇女在中国人民解放军陆、海、空军部队里，出色地完成了各项工作任务；在保卫祖国、保卫社会主义建设的光荣岗位上作出了卓越的贡献，成为国防建设中的一支重要力量。
    为我国航空史上写下光辉一页的新中国女航空员，正在党的教养下迅速成长。她们分别掌握了飞行、领航、通讯、机械、跳伞、滑翔等复杂的航空科学技术，有些人还担任了飞行大队长、中队长、机长、领航参谋和机械长等职务。由于她们有着坚韧不拔的毅力和刻苦钻研的精神，飞行技术在迅速提高。秦桂芳中尉现在已经是“全天候”飞行员，她白天能起飞，夜空能返航，云雾里能驾驶，风雨中也能安全飞行。1958年从某航空学校毕业的李丽真少尉，现在已经成为熟悉全国每一条航线，了解航线上主要地标和航行资料的女领航员。人们亲昵地叫她是“三快一准”（手快、眼快、脑子快，计算准）的“巧姑娘”。
    在福建前线，有一批女广播员，她们成年累月、风雨不误，在前沿坑道或隐蔽部里，向金门等岛屿上的蒋军广播祖国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，我军对投诚、起义人员的宽大政策和蒋军亲属给蒋军士兵的信件。广播员陈斐斐，八、九年来没有离开过阵地，敌人越打炮，她广播得越有劲。有时，她的广播器被打坏了，她就冒着炮火和技术员一起抢修。几年来，她不断受到表扬和奖励。
    在祖国军事通讯工作岗位上的女报务员、电话员、技术员，在医务战线上的女军医、女护士、女研究员，在后勤战线上的女军需工人等，几年来都为国防建设事业作出了贡献。
    女运动员越来越多
   26人先后十一次打破八项世界纪录
    据新华社6日讯　在过去的十年中，新中国妇女参加体育运动的人数有了巨大增长，在体育运动方面取得了很大成就。仅在1957年到1959年的三年中，我国已有二十六名女运动员先后十一次打破了田径、跳伞、登山和射击等方面的八项世界纪录。我国的女子乒乓球、速度滑冰、篮球、排球、体操、赛艇、无线电收发报、摩托车越野等其他一些体育运动项目，也都达到或接近了国际水平。
    十年前，我国妇女在体育运动方面还没有什么基础。但随着社会主义建设的迅速发展，党和政府为开展体育运动创造了越来越好的条件，参加体育运动的妇女也越来越多。
    今天，在我国，成千上万的女职工经常参加体育活动。如北京棉纺织一、二、三厂每天都有许多女工坚持做广播体操。在大、中、小学中，体育运动已经得到普遍开展。女学生们都参加了学校里的体育活动。
    在农村，由于合作化特别是人民公社化以后，从家务劳动中解放出来的广大农村妇女，参加体育活动的人数也在日益增加。我国各少数民族妇女在体育运动方面的才能，在解放后也得到了发挥。
    在这样广泛开展的群众基础上，十年来我国妇女在体育运动的技术水平方面，也有了飞跃发展和显著的提高。到1958年为止，已有六十七万多人达到了等级运动员的标准，目前，有四百八十六名女运动员已经获得运动健将的称号。
    在作为各项体育运动基础的田径运动方面，我国女运动员不仅到1955年为止就已经全部刷新了解放前的全国纪录，而且到1957年，二十岁的郑凤荣还创造了女子跳高的世界纪录，为我国体育史上写下了光辉的一页。我国田径运动水平普遍提高的情况，在去年第一届全运会上表现得十分突出。
    我国的女子跳伞运动虽然开展得比较晚，但在1958到1959年的两年中，全国已经有十五名女选手八次打破了五项女子集体跳伞的世界纪录。女子登山运动在我国开展只有两年的时间，而在1959年我国就有九名女子登山运动员打破了女子登山的世界纪录。在1959年，二十四岁的护士陈蓉也以五百八十九环的成绩，打破了女子自选小口径步枪五十和一百米各三十发卧射五百八十八环的世界纪录。
    我国的女子乒乓球、篮球、排球、体操、速度滑冰、赛艇、无线电收发报、摩托车越野等项运动的水平，几年来也都有很大的进步。
