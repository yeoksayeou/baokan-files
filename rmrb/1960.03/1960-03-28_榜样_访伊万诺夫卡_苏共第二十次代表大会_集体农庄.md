    A Model
    ——Visiting the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" Collective Farm
    By Our Correspondent Li Nan
    Just as Ivan and Ivanov are the most common names and surnames in Russia, Ivanovka is also the most common and typical name for a Russian village. There are many small villages with this name throughout the Soviet Union. Today, we are going to visit Ivanovka in the Moscow Oblast, which is also a small village, but it is this small Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm that has set an advanced example for the whole country to complete the seven-year plan for animal husbandry ahead of schedule in a short period.

    The wide Minsk highway stretches straight westward. We followed this highway for more than fifty kilometers, then turned north, crossed the frozen Moscow River, and entered a forest of villa districts. The forest area surrounds a slightly undulating field. In the center of the field, from a distance, you can see the outline of a village. Passers-by pointed us to this as the Ivanovka we were going to.

    We had to brave the February wind and snow and walk three kilometers because more than a meter of snow blocked the road for cars. Since the December Plenum at the end of last year, many people from all over the country have walked to Ivanovka to visit. The unconventional speed of development, bold innovative ideas, and outstanding achievements surpassing the United States have linked the name of the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm with the struggle of the entire Soviet people to solve basic economic tasks.

    A Collective Farm's Path

    Since the Party Central Committee put forward the task of accelerating the development of animal husbandry and surpassing the United States, the members of the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm have been more thoughtful. The nearby collective farms are busy, buying building materials, adding farm buildings, and adding feeding staff. Some collective farms are planning to ask the bank for loans and appeal to some factories and enterprises in Moscow for help. But this small collective farm seemed to have been forgotten, there was no movement there, and no one gave it special care.

    But the small Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm, which was not noticed or valued by people, was conducting heated discussions and debates. The chairman of the collective farm, Povze, and the vast majority of members did not agree with the method of asking the bank for loans and asking for help from above. "You can't turn rubles into meat and milk immediately!" the members said excitedly. "Moreover, millions of rubles are spent before a liter of milk is obtained, and it takes at least two years. The hope of winning time will be lost."

    The collective farm began to brew a thorough reform of dairy cow breeding methods. The chairman of the collective farm, Povze, and the management committee proposed changing the past practice of tying cows in barns, changing the tradition of people serving cattle, and letting cattle take care of themselves. This can multiply production without adding housing or asking for money and help from above.

    However, this change violates the principles propagated by animal husbandry for decades and violates long-standing breeding methods. The chairman of a neighboring collective farm, hearing that cows were not fed in stalls and not given feed on a regular basis, simply did not believe that this would have any results, he said: "I will never allow this crude method to be used." Some people also ridiculed: "This is the feeding method of the Genohese Tsar era." The Genohese Tsar era is the oldest era in Russian legends, like the Chinese saying of the Fuxi and Shennong era.

    The collective farm's animal husbandry officer was even more completely angered by this reform. He said: "What are you planning to do? For thirty years, animal husbandry science has advocated individual care for dairy cows, but you want to keep the cows untied in the barns. The cows will fight, and the feed will be eaten up before the first month of the year."

    Contrary to the views of the animal husbandry officer, the milkmaids who worked directly fully agreed with this innovation. The young milkmaid Lyuba Sesoyeva said in the debate: "Dairy cows are not stupid. They will not eat more than they should. According to our experience, dairy cows take care of themselves no worse at all." In order to prove her point, Lyuba asked to immediately follow the new method, and she increased from caring for ten dairy cows to fifty.

    The animal husbandry officer was unwilling to take the risk for the new method, packed his bags, and left the collective farm. The collective farm's production soared.

    Labor Completely Changed

    Many people from nearby collective farms are visiting the farm. The staff of the Leningrad Scientific Film Studio are shooting a documentary. We also watched with everyone to see how a milkmaid can take care of one hundred and fifty cows and squeeze all the milk in two hours.

    The scene in the farm is indeed different from many other collective farms. All the cowsheds have been removed, and the number of dairy cows has more than doubled, which makes it look more spacious than other farms. The milking parlor is a specially designed small area, which is fully mechanized, but this is not complicated, but simple but can completely reduce the labor of the milkmaid's mechanization.

    It's milking time. The cows are waiting outside the door, waiting for the door to open, and then they walk in in order. The milking parlor milks six cows at a time. The milkers feed the dairy cows with concentrate feed while wearing electric milking machines for them, and then observe the milk output through glass tubes. After milking, the cows came out from another door.

    Chairman Povze told us: "It only takes ten days to half a month for the cows to get completely used to it." Now they milk three times a day, nearly two hundred dairy cows, each time only takes two hours.

    Will feed consumption increase? The chairman told us: now the feed cost per quintal of milk is reduced by thirty feed units compared to the method of feeding in cowsheds.

    But those who doubt that the new feeding method violates scientific principles have another argument, that the cows cannot survive the winter, the cows will not be able to withstand the harsh Russian winter, the cows will catch colds, and reduce milk production. According to the experience of the "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm, people's suspicion has also completely disappeared. It turns out that what dairy cows fear most is not cold but humidity. When the cows are freed, they will choose dry places by themselves. As for production, not only did it not decrease in the winter months, but it increased instead. For example, in January, when the old method was implemented, each cow produced 137 liters of milk, and after the new method was implemented, it was 250 liters. In February, it was originally 181 liters, and after the new method was implemented, it became 260 liters.

    The labor of the milkmaid has also completely changed. The milkmaid Lyuba Sesoyeva said well in her speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League: "Now the labor of the milkmaid has completely changed. The only thing that has not changed is the name of the milkmaid." Indeed, their labor is close to the labor of factory workers.

    The past concerns and worries of the collective farm's animal husbandry officer did not come true. According to the concept formed by animal husbandry science for many years, he believed that cows should be raised in cowsheds, the personality habits of each dairy cow should be studied, and they should be taken care of comfortably, otherwise high milk production would not be obtained. The chairman of the collective farm, Povze, told us: "Animal husbandry has always believed that each dairy cow should be tied separately in a cowshed, with a separate feeding quota, and should be milked and cared for separately, as a result, dairy cows have become 'counts' who need to be carefully served, and milkmaids have become serving servants." The "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm abandoned the principle of turning dairy cows into "counts," and as a result, dairy cows are still dairy cows, and animal husbandry has greatly developed.

    Now this advanced method is being demonstrated at the National Economic Achievement Exhibition, and many collective farms are adopting this method.

    To Win Three Years of Time

    The progress of the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm in animal husbandry is amazing. Since 1956, meat production has increased four times in four years, and milk production has increased five or six times. Labor productivity has increased tenfold, and the number of dairy cows cared for by milkmaids has increased twelve to fifteen times. The cost per kilogram of milk has been reduced from two rubles to sixty kopecks.

    The milk production per hundred hectares of agricultural land in the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm has far exceeded the level of the United States. At the same time, the labor productivity in the collective farm's animal husbandry has also exceeded that of the United States. People still remember that after the US Secretary of Agriculture Benson visited the Soviet Union, he no longer denied that the Soviet Union would quickly surpass the United States in agricultural output, but he still shamelessly said that the level of labor productivity in Soviet agricultural production would never surpass the United States.

    When someone talked to the members of the "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm about this great saying of the US Secretary of Agriculture, the members all laughed. Lyuba Sesoyeva said: "Our collective farm has already surpassed the Americans in terms of labor productivity. The labor force spent on each quintal of milk in our collective farm, if calculated by the number of people and hours combined, is 3.8, while the Americans are 4.7. This year, labor productivity will be further improved, and one labor force can produce one quintal of milk in three hours.

    We also heard about this in this collective farm: a farm in Wisconsin, USA, where one hundred and seventy dairy cows are taken care of by a total of three people, and the farm owner believes that this is a remarkable achievement, and specially made a large billboard, calling itself the "World Farm," and equipped a special room for visiting travelers to live in. The two hundred dairy cows in the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm have only two milkmaids, and the labor productivity is much higher than this farm in the United States.

    But the members of this collective farm are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. There is a slogan expressing determination in the collective farm: "We are determined to complete the collective farm's seven-year plan in four years." The members of the Ivanovka "20th Party Congress of the CPSU" collective farm want to win three years of time! (Attached picture)

    榜样
    ——访伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄
    本报记者　李楠
    像伊万和伊万诺夫是俄罗斯人最普通的名字和姓氏一样，伊万诺夫卡也是最普通、最典型的俄罗斯村庄的名字。这样名称的小村庄在苏联全国有许多个。今天我们要去访问的莫斯科州伊万诺夫卡也是一个不大的村庄，但是正是这个小小的伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄，在短短的时间内，给全国提前完成畜牧业的七年计划树立了一个先进的榜样。
    宽阔的明斯克公路笔直地向西伸展。我们沿着这条公路，走了五十多公里，然后折向北方，越过冻结的莫斯科河，走进了一片别墅区的森林。森林地带围绕着一块略为起伏不平的原野。在原野的中央从遥远的地方，可以看见一个村庄的轮廓。路人给我们指点：这就是我们要去的伊万诺夫卡。
    我们必须冒着2月的风雪，步行三公里，因为一米多厚的积雪阻挡了汽车通行的道路。从去年底十二月全会以来，许许多多来自各地的人们，也这样地步行到伊万诺夫卡来参观访问。打破常规的发展速度、大胆的革新思想、超过美国的卓越成就，使得伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄的名字同全苏联人民解决基本经济任务的斗争联结在一起了。
    一个农庄的道路
    党中央提出加速发展畜牧业、超过美国的任务以来，伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄的庄员们多了一层心思。附近的农庄都忙碌起来了，他们忙着购买建筑材料，增建饲养场舍，加添饲养人员。有的农庄计划着向银行要求贷款，向莫斯科的一些工厂企业吁请帮助。但是这个小小的农庄像被人遗忘了似地，那里没有什么动静，也没有什么人给以特别的关怀。
    但是不受到人们注意和重视的小伊万诺夫卡的“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄，却正在进行着热烈的讨论和争论。农庄主席波夫泽和绝大多数庄员都不赞成向银行贷款、向上面要求帮助的办法。“你不能马上把卢布变成肉类和牛奶！”庄员们这样激动地说。“况且几百万卢布在还没有得到一公升牛奶之前就花掉了，而且起码得等待两年时间。赢得时间的希望是会落空的。”
    农庄开始酝酿彻底改革奶牛饲养方法。农庄主席波夫泽和管理委员会提出改变过去把奶牛拴在牛栏里的作法，改变人侍候牛的传统，让牛自己照应自己。这样不增建房舍，不向上面要金钱和帮助，就能成倍地提高产量。
    可是，这种改变是违背饲畜学几十年来所宣传的道理的，是违反长期以来的饲养方法的。邻近的一个农庄主席听说不把牛拴在栏里喂养，不按定时定量给以饲料，简直不相信这会有什么结果，他说：“我绝不容许采用这种粗野的办法。”还有人讥笑说：“这是格诺赫沙皇时代的饲养方法。”格诺赫沙皇时代是俄罗斯人传说中最古老的年代，好像中国人说伏羲、神农时代一样。
    农庄的饲畜师更完全被这种改革激怒了。他说：“你们打算怎样干呢？饲畜科学三十年来都提倡个别照看奶牛的做法，而你们要把牛不拴在牛栏里。牛会打架，不到正月里就会把饲料吃个精光。”
    和饲畜师的看法相反，直接劳动的挤奶妇们却完全赞同这种革新。年青的挤奶妇柳芭·色索也娃在争论中说：“奶牛并不蠢笨。它们并不会比应该吃的吃得多。根据我们的经验，奶牛自己照顾自己一点也不差。”为了证明自己的看法，柳芭要求立刻按照新方法，她从看照十条奶牛增加到五十条。
    饲畜师不愿意为新方法承担风险，收拾行囊，离开了农庄。农庄的生产却扶摇直上了。
    劳动完全改观了
    许多来自附近农庄的人们正在饲畜场参观。列宁格勒科学电影制片厂的工作人员正在拍摄纪录影片。我们也和大家一道看着究竟一个挤奶妇怎样能够看管一百五十条牛，在两小时时间全部把奶挤完。
    饲畜场的景象的确和其他许多农庄的饲畜场不一样。牛栏全部撤除了，乳牛的数目增加了一倍多，倒显得比其他饲畜场宽敞。挤奶室是一个专门设计的小场地，这里是完全机械化了的，但是这不是复杂，只是简易的但却能彻底减轻挤奶妇劳动的机械化。
    正是挤奶的时间。奶牛都等候在门外，等待门一开，就挨次序地走了进去。挤奶室一次挤六条奶牛。挤奶员一边给奶牛喂精饲料，一边就给它们戴上电气挤奶器，然后，就通过玻璃管观察出奶的情况。挤奶完毕后，牛就从另一道门走了出来。
    主席波夫泽告诉我们说：“只要十天到半个月的时间，牛就完全养成习惯了。”现在每天挤三次奶，将近两百条奶牛，每次只要两小时的时间。
    饲料消耗是不是会增多呢？主席告诉我们：现在每公担牛奶花费的饲料比在牛栏里饲养的方法时减少了三十个饲料单位。
    但是怀疑新饲养方法违背科学原理的人还有一个论据，就是牛不能过冬，牛会耐不过严寒的俄罗斯冬季，牛会伤风感冒，减少牛奶产量。根据“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄的经验，人们的这一怀疑也完全消失了。原来奶牛最怕的不是寒冷而是潮湿。把牛解放了，牛会自己选择干燥的地方。至于产量，冬天月份不但没有减少，相反倒增加了。例如，正月份在实行旧方法时，每条牛产奶一百三十七公升，实行新方法后是二百五十公升。2月份原来是一百八十一公升，实行新方法后变成了二百六十公升。
    挤奶妇的劳动也完全改观了。挤奶妇柳芭·色索也娃在参加苏联共青团中央全会时的讲话说得好：“现在挤奶妇的劳动完全改变了。没有改变的只是挤奶妇这个名称。”的确，她们的劳动接近于工厂工人的劳动了。
    过去的农庄饲畜师的担心和顾虑并没有实现。他根据饲畜科学多少年来形成的观念，认为要把牛饲养在牛栏里，要研究每条奶牛的性格习惯，要照顾得舒舒服服，不然就不会获得牛奶的高产量。集体农庄主席波夫泽对我们说：“一向的饲畜学总认为每条奶牛要单独拴在牛栏里，有单独的饲养定额，应该单独挤奶，单独照料，结果把奶牛变成了要精心侍候的‘伯爵’，而挤奶妇倒成了侍候的仆役。”“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄抛弃了这种把奶牛变成“伯爵”的原理，结果奶牛仍然是奶牛，饲畜业大发展了。
    现在这个先进的方法正在国民经济成就展览会上表演，许多农庄都正在采用这个方法。
    要赢得三年时间
    伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄在饲畜业中的进步是使人惊异的。从1956年来，四年内肉类生产提高了四倍，牛奶产量增加了五、六倍。劳动生产率提高了十倍，挤奶妇看管的奶牛数目增加了十二倍到十五倍。每公斤牛奶的成本从两个卢布减少为六十个戈比。
    伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄每百公顷农业用地上的牛奶产量已经远远地超过了美国的水平。同时，这个农庄饲畜业中的劳动生产率也超过了美国。人们还记得美国农业部长本逊到苏联访问以后，他再也不否认苏联在农业产量上会迅速超过美国，但却还大言不惭地说，苏联农业生产中劳动生产率的水平绝不会超过美国。
    当有人向“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄的庄员们谈起美国农业部长的这句大言时，庄员们都笑起来了。柳芭·色索也娃说道：“我们的农庄，早已在劳动生产率方面超过了美国人。我们农庄花在每公担牛奶上的劳动力，如果按人数和时数合并计算是三点八，而美国人是四点七。今年劳动生产率还要进一步提高，一个劳动力三小时就能生产一公担牛奶。
    我们在这个农庄里还听说这样一件事情：美国威斯康辛州一家农场，那里一百七十条奶牛，一共三个人管照，农场主人认为这是了不得的成绩，专门做了一个大广告牌，自称是“世界农场”，并且装备一间专门的屋子，供参观旅行者住用。伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄的两百条奶牛，只有两个挤奶妇，劳动生产率比美国这家农场要超出得多。
    但是这个农庄的庄员们并不满足于已得的成绩。农庄里有一块表示决心的标语：“我们决心四年完成农庄的七年计划”。伊万诺夫卡“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄的庄员们要赢得三年的时间！（附图片）
