    No Waste Here
    – Introducing the Shanghai Municipal Exhibition of Comprehensive Material Utilization
    People often call a fish bone, a weed, a stream of sewage, or a wisp of smoke "waste," but after you visit the Shanghai Municipal Exhibition of Comprehensive Material Utilization, you will find the word "waste" very inaccurate for them. They are not "waste," but valuable assets.
    Unlimited Potential of Scrap Materials
    Walking into the exhibition, the most striking thing is the many colorful solids and liquids placed in small glass bottles. These are all new products extracted from waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue by Shanghai chemical factories. The walls are covered with many charts, with many chemical equations drawn on them. Although the content is different, the problem they illustrate is the same: the comprehensive utilization of chemical raw materials can unleash power that people can hardly imagine. Last year, factories in Shanghai's pharmaceutical and dye industries produced nearly 300 kinds of chemical products from waste and scrap materials. The chemical fertilizer made from dye factory scrap alone amounted to more than 600 tons, which could be used to fertilize more than 40,000 mu of farmland. The resulting increase in grain production could feed 150,000 people for a month.
    The Shanghai No. 4 Pharmaceutical Factory produces chlorpromazine, a drug for treating nervous system disorders, using a total of 24 raw materials. After repeated chemical reactions, the scrap waste left over from making the drug turns into 25 kinds of materials. Of the 22 kinds that have already been recovered, 12 kinds can be reused to produce chlorpromazine, some are made into deworming agents for livestock, organic solvents and other raw materials, and some become intermediates for manufacturing other important drugs.
    Acids and alkalis, which are the most widely used and consumed, have even greater potential for comprehensive utilization. Last year, the Shanghai Furan Resin Store recovered more than 100,000 tons of waste acid from various sources, supplying more than 400 factories to manufacture various chemical products and daily necessities. In the past, when these waste acids were not utilized, Shanghai had to spend more than 100,000 yuan a year to transport and dump them. Now, not only can this expense be saved, but more than 800,000 yuan of raw materials can be added. With one inflow and one outflow, the wealth has increased by about one million yuan.
    Panning for “Gold” in Mud
    A chart at the exhibition tells people: Shanghai now has 1.8 million tons of sewage every day. If all of it is utilized, the nitrogen content is equivalent to 1,100 tons of ammonium sulfate. That is to say, using this sewage to irrigate farmland can exert the effect of 20 million dan of fertilizer. Shanghai's relevant departments have taken action based on these fascinating figures. The Urban Construction Bureau is currently expanding two factories specializing in sewage treatment. They use sewage to try to grow water chestnuts, water celery and other crops, and the results are much larger than those irrigated with river water.
    Some research units in Shanghai have also begun to extract vitamin B12 from sludge. This is a drug that promotes animal growth. Pigs that eat it grow 20% to 30% more meat in two months than pigs that do not take the medicine.
    Every 100 tons of sludge can also extract 2.8 tons of gasoline, 3.2 tons of kerosene, 2.2 tons of diesel... Sludge ferments under conditions of low oxygen, producing a large amount of methane gas, which is a gas with very high combustion efficiency. Some sludge can even extract raw materials for making plastics.
    If sewage and sludge are like this, what else can be called "waste" in our lives?
    Livestock Offer Hundreds of Treasures
    Pork can be eaten, pigskin can be made into leather, pig manure can fertilize fields... This is well known, but pig liver, gall, heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and pituitary glands in the brain, as small as soybeans, what are they used for in industry, most people may not know. Shanghai has now produced and successfully tested more than 100 kinds of products using these things, and their total value exceeds the value of pork. Not to mention anything else, just talk about pig bile. In the past, Shanghai meat processing plants always discarded it as waste. Now it is used to make several products. One of them, called bilirubin, is an extremely important raw material in the chemical industry and scientific research. When it was previously imported from abroad, it cost 128,000 yuan per kilogram. After Shanghai mass-produced it, this raw material was no longer imported, saving the country a lot of foreign exchange. Several other factories use pig bile to make more than ten kinds of raw materials such as cholic acid, bile salts, bile powder, and bile viridin. The repeated use of various internal organs greatly increases the value of pigs. Originally, a pig stomach was only worth 8 jiao, but when it was taken to the Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory to make medicine, the value immediately increased sevenfold.
    The hides, fur, and internal organs of livestock and poultry such as cattle, horses, sheep, and chickens are also serving people better. Several leather factories in Shanghai have many scattered scraps of cowhide during leather making. No one would have thought that these hard and dirty scraps would become soft and transparent gelatin after being steamed and processed in a chemical factory. The poor quality ones are used to make glue for pencils and sandpaper, and the good ones are used to culture bacteria, make cod liver oil capsules or photographic film. Each ton of scraps therefore increases the product by more than 3,000 yuan. There are also several sweaters and blankets at the exhibition that feel very soft. If you don't look at the instructions next to them, I'm afraid few people would think that they are made of chicken feathers.
    Yesterday's Unknown Soldiers, Today's Honored Guests
    The exhibition also features comprehensive utilization products of various plants such as melons, fruits, flowers, and grasses. The most interesting is the comprehensive utilization of oranges by the Shanghai Yimin Food Factory. Almost the entire orange is utilized after entering this factory. The complete orange sacs are made into canned sugar oranges; the slightly broken ones are mashed into a paste to make orange jam or orange infant cakes; orange kernels and orange fibers are picked out for Chinese medicine stores to make medicinal materials; the very thin orange peel is divided into two layers, the outer layer is used to squeeze orange oil (fragrance), and the remaining residue is combined with the inner layer and ground into powder to make various fragrant and delicious orange marmalade, orange jelly soft candy, and candied oranges. One ton of oranges, which was originally only worth 600 yuan, has exerted a value of 3,000 yuan.
    The value of wild plants that were not discovered in the past is hard to compare once they are utilized by people. Shanghai Soap Factory and Wuzhou Soap Factory have used 170,000 jin of Litsea cubeba oil, Ficus erecta oil, Malus spectabilis oil and other wild plant oils in the past two years, increasing the production of more than 20,000 boxes of soap. In the past year, Shanghai's fragrance industry used more than 50 kinds of wild plant oils such as Litsea cubeba oil, turpentine oil, and broom oil to make 2.27 million kilograms of synthetic fragrances, worth more than 60 million yuan. The scrap residue of wild plants is reused to make more than 700 tons of chemical raw materials, which adds more than 2 million yuan. These unknown soldiers who were originally in the mountains and forests have become honored guests of many factories.
    The Sea Offers Treasures
    In addition to aquatic products such as fish, shellfish, shrimp, and crabs that can be comprehensively used to manufacture various fish scale glitter powders, artificial pearls, and crab shell solidifying agents, seawater is an even greater resource.
    Seawater contains many valuable rare elements, such as lithium, rubidium, cesium, etc., which are essential for scientific research. However, the content of these elements in seawater is extremely small, and it is indeed not easy to extract them. According to foreign literature, to comprehensively utilize seawater, there must be many valuable instruments and extremely complex analysis methods. The Shanghai Marine Chemical Research Institute, East China University of Chemical Technology and other units have recently joined forces to extract potassium from seawater. They brought collective wisdom into play and, after countless explorations, finally developed a new synthesis method that greatly improved efficiency and created favorable conditions for the large-scale extraction of potassium. Not long ago, in order to adapt to the current needs of seawater resource survey work, they created a new method for analyzing seawater. Compared with the methods commonly used abroad, it can not only save a lot of labor and instruments, but also is very simple and easy to master.

    这里没有废物
    ——介绍上海市物资综合利用展览会
    人们往往把一根鱼骨、一棵野草、一股污水、一缕青烟，叫做“废物”，但当你参观了上海市物资综合利用展览会后，便发现“废物”这个词对它们很不确切。它们不是“废物”，而是宝贵的财富。
    下脚废料潜力无穷
    走进展览会，最引人瞩目的便是许许多多放在小玻璃瓶里五颜六色的固体和液体的东西。这些都是上海化学工厂从废气、废液、废渣中提取出来的新产品。墙上挂着许多图表，上面画着很多化学方程式，尽管内容不一样，而说明的问题只有一个。这就是化工原料的综合利用，可以发挥出人们难以想像的威力。上海制药、染料行业的工厂，去年就利用废料下脚生产了近三百种化工产品。单单从染料厂下脚中回收制成的化学肥料就有六百多吨，可供四万多亩田用来施肥，因此而增产的粮食，十五万人可吃一个月。
    上海第四制药厂生产一种治疗神经系统病症的药品氯丙嗪，一共用二十四种原料。这二十四种原料经过反复多次的化学反应，制成药品剩下的下脚废料，变成了二十五种。目前已经回收的二十二种中，十二种可以重新用来生产氯丙嗪，其余有的制成了畜用的驱虫剂、有机溶剂等原料，有的变成了制造另外一些重要药品的中间体。
    用途最广、用量最大的酸碱，综合利用的潜力更大。上海糠酸商店去年从各方面回收了十万多吨废酸，供给四百多家工厂制造各种化工产品和生活用品。过去这些废酸没有利用时，上海每年还要花上十多万元的费用，才把它们运出去倒掉。现在不但可以省掉这笔开支，还增加八十多万元的原料。一进一出，无形中增加了约一百万元的财富。
    泥里淘“金”
    展览会上有一幅图表告诉人们：上海现在每天有一百八十万吨污水，如果全部加以利用，内中所含的氮，等于一千一百吨硫酸铵。也就是说，用这些污水来灌溉农田，可以发挥二千万担肥料的效能。上海有关部门根据这些引人入胜的数字，已经行动起来了。城市建设局最近正在扩建两座专门处理污水的工厂。他们用污水来试种茭白、水芹等作物，结果比用河水灌溉的都大得多。
    上海有些研究单位还开始从污泥里提炼维生素乙12。这是一种促进动物生长的药品。猪吃了，过了两个月，比不吃药的猪多长了20％到30％的肉。
    每一百吨污泥，还可以提出二点八吨汽油、三点二吨煤油、二点二吨柴油……。污泥在氧气很少的条件下进行发酵，会发生大量的甲烷气，这是一种有着很高燃烧效能的气体。有的污泥甚至还可以提取制造塑料的原料。
    污水污泥，尚且如此，在我们生活中，还有什么可以称得“废物”的呢？
    六畜献百宝
    猪肉可食用，猪皮可制革，猪粪可肥田……，这是人所共知的，但是猪肝、胆、心、肺、腰、眼睛和脑子里小得像黄豆的脑下垂体，在工业上有什么用，一般人就不一定知道了。上海现在利用这些东西已经生产和试验成功的产品共有一百多种，它们的总值超过了猪肉的价值。别的不说，单说猪胆。上海肉类加工厂过去一直把它当作废料丢掉。现在却用来做成了好几种产品。其中有一种叫胆红素，是化学工业和科学研究方面极为重要的原料。以前靠国外进口时，一公斤竟要十二万八千元，上海大量生产后，这种原料就不进口了，为国家节约了大量外汇。还有几家工厂用猪胆制成了胆酸、胆盐、胆粉、胆绿素等十多种原料。各种内脏的一用再用，猪的身价便大大提高。原来一只猪胃只值八角钱，拿到上海生物化学制药厂做药品，价值马上提高七倍。
    牛、马、羊、鸡等牲畜、家禽的皮毛内脏，也在为人们更好地效劳。上海几家制革厂，在制革时有许多零零星星的碎牛皮。谁也想不到，这些又硬又脏的碎皮，拿到化工厂蒸煮处理后，竟会变成又软又透明的明胶，质量差的，用来做铅笔、砂皮的胶水，好的用来培养细菌，做鱼肝油胶丸或照相底片。每吨碎皮因此而增加了三千多元的产品。展览会上还有几件摸上去非常柔软的绒衫、绒毯，不看旁边的说明，恐怕很少人能想到，是用鸡毛做成的。
    昔日无名小卒　今日座上贵客
    展览会里还有瓜、果、花、草等各种各样植物的综合利用产品。最有趣的要算上海益民食品一厂桔子的综合利用了。一只桔子进了这个厂，几乎全部被利用。完整的桔囊，做糖水桔子罐头；有点破碎的，打成糊状，做桔酱或桔子乳儿糕；桔核和桔络，拣出来给中药店去做药材；很薄的桔子皮被分成两层，外面一层用来榨桔油（香料），余下来的残渣又和内层合在一起磨成粉末，做成各种香美可口的桔子果酱、桔子冻软糖、桔子蜜饯。一吨原来只值六百元的桔子，却发挥出了三千元价值的作用。
    过去没有被发现的野生植物，一旦为人们所利用，价值就很难相比了。上海制皂厂、五洲肥皂厂，最近二年来，先后用了十七万斤乌子油、毕橙芥油、海棠油等等野生植物的油脂，增产了两万多箱肥皂。上海香料业在去年一年内，用山苍子油、松节油、扫把油等五十多种野生植物油，制成了二百二十七万公斤的合成香料，价值六千多万元。野生植物的下脚废渣进行再利用，制成了七百多吨化工原料，又增加了两百多万元。这些原来在山间林中的无名小卒，一跃而成了许多工厂的座上贵客。
    海水献宝
    海里除鱼蚌虾蟹等水产品可以综合用来制造各种鱼鳞闪光粉、人造珍珠、蟹壳牢固剂外，海水更是个大资源。
    海水含有多种宝贵的稀有元素，例如锂、铷、铯等等，都是科学研究工作上必不可少的。可是这些元素在海水中的含量极微，要把它们提出来，确实不容易。按照国外文献规定，要综合利用海水，一定要有许多贵重的仪器，还要有极复杂的分析方法。上海海水化学研究所、华东化工学院等几个单位最近已经联合起来向海水要钾。他们发挥集体智慧，经过无数次的摸索，终于研究成功了一种新的合成方法，效率大大提高，为大量提取钾创造了有利条件。前不久，他们为了适应当前海水资源普查工作的需要，又创造了一种新的分析海水的方法，和国外习用的办法相比，不仅可以节省大量的劳动力和仪器，而且非常简便，很容易掌握。
