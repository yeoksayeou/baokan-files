A mass movement for spring mating of female livestock is unfolding across Shaanxi Province. This year's spring mating drive began more than a month earlier than last year.

Since last year, people's communes throughout Shaanxi Province have conscientiously implemented the policy of taking pigs as the key link and developing animal husbandry in an all-round way, resulting in a new situation of thriving livestock and a comprehensive leap forward. The number of large livestock in the province has generally increased, and many counties and cities with large-scale, high-yield production have emerged. Among them, Yichuan, Huangling, Weinan, and other counties achieved a net increase rate of over 10% in livestock last year, while Zichang, Yanchang, and Shangnan counties had a net increase rate of 8%. Many communes and production teams have created outstanding achievements in the great leap forward in the development of large livestock. The Panlong People's Commune in Yan'an achieved a net increase rate of 25.6% in livestock last year, and the Mogou Production Team in the Huangping Management District of Shangnan County achieved a net increase rate of 32.3%.

As early as December 1959, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee formulated a plan for the development of large livestock this year. Cities, counties, communes, and production teams have implemented livestock breeding plans at all levels and have made full preparations in terms of ideology, personnel, and management. Many counties, communes, and management districts have also established mating command headquarters (groups), and all localities have generally rectified the ranks of breeders in conjunction with the commune rectification, adding a large number of outstanding breeders.

Various localities have widely adopted methods such as on-site meetings to promote advanced experiences, which has powerfully promoted the concentrated mating movement. Hanzhong, Yan'an, and other areas have held on-site meetings from the special district to the county to the commune, and many communes have also held livestock competitions and evaluation meetings. The Hanzhong Special District held an on-site meeting in the famous "cattle-producing area" - the Banqiao Management District of Xixiang County. This management district has maintained "double full" (full膘, full怀) and "five complete" (complete配, complete怀, complete产, complete活, complete健壮) for four consecutive years, with an average annual net increase of 32.8%. By the end of February this year, all female livestock had been mated, with a pregnancy rate of 100%, producing sixty-six calves, with a survival rate of 100%, and fat cattle accounted for 92%. After on-site observation and debate, the cadres attending the meeting proposed that the entire special district should achieve "Banqiao-ization" by the end of May. Currently, more than 80,000 breeding-age female livestock in this special district have conceived, with over 23,000 already pregnant.

People's communes in various localities have organized collaboration and adjusted public breeding livestock in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, promoted advanced mating techniques, and greatly accelerated the mating speed of large livestock. Communes throughout the province have generally promoted "three changes" (changing two births in three years to one birth per year, changing natural mating to artificial insemination, changing wild mating to selective breeding) and "four matings" (early mating, heat mating, double mating, continuous mating). Pucheng County has also created a method of "three concentrations, three matings, and one patrol," in which breeding livestock, female livestock, and mating personnel are concentrated in communes, and estrous female livestock are mated in a timely manner, non-estrous ones are induced to mate, and those that cannot be mated are supplemented, and mating assault teams are organized to patrol and mate.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th - People's communes throughout Shanxi Province are actively carrying out spring mating work for large livestock, focusing on full mating and full conception.

Since entering February, more than 2,300 large livestock mating stations in people's communes throughout the province have been busy mating female livestock all day long. Mating experts also lead excellent breeding livestock and patrol the breeding farms, stables, and fields in various management areas, taking advantage of production gaps to mate estrous female livestock. To date, more than 564,000 breeding-age female donkeys, mares, and cows in the province have been mated in the spring, and coupled with those already pregnant, more than 60% are already pregnant.

This year, people's communes in various parts of Shanxi Province have paid special attention to the development of large livestock. Before the arrival of the spring mating season, they had made preparations in advance. People's communes in the four special districts of Southern Shanxi, Southeastern Shanxi, Central Shanxi, and Northern Shanxi generally conducted inspections and investigations of existing breeding-age female livestock, classifying and arranging them. After clarifying the distribution and health status of breeding-age non-pregnant female livestock, they formulated mating plans. For the 4% of weak, non-pregnant breeding-age female livestock, measures such as reducing labor and feeding refined feed have been generally adopted to promote early estrus. The Jinzhong Special District has also widely promoted the experience of artificial estrus induction, thus greatly accelerating the mating speed.

In order to make the distribution of mating stations and breeding males more reasonable and facilitate timely mating, in addition to adjusting the existing 2,300 large livestock mating stations, the two special districts of Southern Shanxi and Northern Shanxi have also added many mating stations, so that every people's commune and larger management area has a mating station. Communes in various localities also planned and adjusted the existing 20,300 excellent breeding males according to the distribution of non-pregnant female livestock, preventing the phenomenon of female livestock running long distances, affecting conception.

In order to push the spring mating work of large livestock to a new climax, competitions centered on "one full, two highs, three fasts, and four goods" (i.e., full mating; high conception rate, high utilization rate of breeding livestock; fast estrus of female livestock, fast mating, fast conception; good estrus of female livestock, good adjustment of breeding livestock, good breeding and management of breeding livestock and female livestock) have been widely launched between stations, between communes, between management areas, and between people. Mating workers are doing everything possible to adopt methods such as hot mating, re-mating, multiple mating, and continuous mating to increase the conception rate of female livestock. People's communes and many government agencies, factories, mines, and transportation departments have reduced and reduced the labor time and intensity of female livestock to facilitate estrus and mating. Some people's communes and management areas have also handed over the three rights of mating, rest, and labor of female livestock to breeders and implemented the method of assigning people, assigning tasks, assigning time, and assigning remuneration, which has solved the contradiction between mating and labor while improving the enthusiasm of breeders for mating and breeding large livestock.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 28th - Since the beginning of spring, the situation on the livestock front in Jilin Province has been unprecedentedly good. After overwintering, large livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys throughout the province are strong and fat, and the historical situation of livestock losing膘 after overwintering has greatly changed. At the same time, the work of receiving pregnant female livestock has also started more than two months earlier than in previous years.

This year, female livestock in various parts of Jilin gave birth earlier, which is the result of implementing early spring mating last year. In order to further promote the experience of early spring mating and enable each breeding-age female livestock to produce one offspring per year, state-owned horse breeding farms trained more than 2,200 mating workers for the 1,831 mating stations of people's communes in various localities as early as January, so that many places started mating ahead of schedule. The Ping'an People's Commune in Da'an County has mated 250 cows and all of them are accurately pregnant.

The red scene in the livestock production in Jilin Province at the beginning of spring fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's commune. Last year, people's communes in various localities, relying on the superior conditions of being large in size and public in nature, generally organized specialized livestock production teams, established pastures and mating networks, and insisted on year-round mating, which greatly improved the conception rate of female livestock. According to statistics, the conception rate of breeding-age female livestock last year was as high as 70%, 10% higher than in 1958. After entering winter, people's communes in various localities generally carried out a livestock protection movement with the content of ensuring膘, ensuring pregnancy, full births, and full survival, and took many effective measures to strengthen the feeding and management of livestock over the winter. In order to prevent livestock from suffering frost damage, many new sheds were built in various places last winter. In the three counties and cities of Dongfeng, Shuangliao, and Liaoyuan alone, 1,506 livestock sheds were built. All 38,000 livestock in Dongfeng County were housed, avoiding the damage of severe cold. Various localities have also especially strengthened the winter feeding and management of old livestock, weak livestock, pregnant livestock, and young livestock, and have generally implemented methods such as grazing in groups, managing in separate circles, feeding in separate troughs, adding grass and feed separately, feeding night grass and drinking night water, so that these livestock have increased more than 20% more than in the same period last year. In order to prevent miscarriage of pregnant livestock, various localities have also taken measures to reduce labor and not to use them for labor to protect pregnancy. Therefore, the number of miscarried female livestock in the province has decreased by about 10% compared with last year. At the same time, the livestock farms of each commune have established obstetrics rooms, making meticulous preparations for obstetrics for female livestock.

In order to strive for red throughout the year in livestock breeding, now people's communes throughout the province have transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into pastures and production teams to inspect and guide obstetrics, mating, feeding management, and other work. Prevention and control personnel from veterinary stations in various localities have also adopted the method of routine inspections to strengthen the prevention and control of livestock diseases in spring.

    抓紧春配季节加快大家畜繁殖
    陕西山西吉林提早时间突击配种
    本报讯　一个大搞母畜春季突击配种的运动，正在陕西全省展开。今年的春季突击配种运动比去年提前了一个多月。
    去年以来，陕西省各地人民公社认真贯彻执行了以猪为纲，全面发展畜牧业的方针，全省出现了一个六畜兴旺，全面跃进的崭新局面，全省大家畜普遍增加，并涌现出许多大面积高额丰产的县、市。其中宜川、黄陵、渭南等县，去年牲畜的净增率达10％以上，子长、延长、商南三个县净增率为8％。许多公社和生产队更创造了大家畜发展特大跃进的突出成绩。延安蟠龙人民公社去年牲畜净增率达25．6％，商南县黄平管区磨沟生产队净增率为32．3％。
    中共陕西省委早在1959年12月，就制定了今年大家畜发展的规划。各市、县、公社和生产队层层落实了牲畜繁殖计划，并从思想、人员、管理等方面都作了充分准备。不少县、社、管理区还成立了配种指挥部（组），各地结合公社整顿，普遍整顿了饲养员队伍，增加了大批优秀饲养员。
    各地广泛采用现场会等办法，推广先进经验，有力地推动了突击配种运动。汉中、延安等由专区到县到公社都举行了现场会议，不少公社还举行了赛畜会，评比会。汉中专区在有名的“牛产地”——西乡县板桥管理区举行了现场会议。这个管理区连续四年保持了双满（满膘、满怀）五全（全配、全怀、全产、全活、全健壮），平均每年净增32．8％。今年2月底，全部母畜都配了种，怀胎率达100％，产仔六十六头，成活率达100％，肥壮牛占92％。通过现场看、辩以后，到会干部提出全专区到5月底都要做到“板桥化”。目前这个专区八万多头适龄母畜，怀胎的已达二万三千多头。
    各地人民公社组织协作，按照互利等价交换的原则，调剂了公种畜，推广了先进的配种技术，大大加快了大家畜配种速度。全省各地公社普遍推广了“三改”（改三年二胎为一年一胎、改自然交配为人工授精交配、改野交乱配为选种选配）和四配（提早配、热胎配、双重配、连续配）。蒲城县还创造了“三集中、三次配、一巡回”的办法，以公社为单位，集中种畜、母畜和配种人员，对发情母畜进行适时配，未发情的用诱情配，配不上的补配，还组织了配种突击队，巡回配种。
    新华社太原28日电　山西各地人民公社，以全配满怀为中心，积极开展大牲畜春季配种工作。
    进入2月以来，全省各地人民公社的二千三百多个大牲畜配种站，整日忙碌地为母畜配种；配种行家们还牵着优良种畜，巡回在各个管理区的饲养处、马厩和田间，趁生产空隙为发情母畜配种。到目前，全省五十六万四千多头适龄母驴、母马、母牛，经过春配，再加上原来怀胎的，已有60％以上怀胎。
    今年，山西省各地人民公社特别重视大牲畜的发展。春季配种季节到来前，就提早做好了各项准备工作。晋南、晋东南、晋中、晋北等四个专区的各人民公社，对现有适龄母畜，普遍进行了检查摸底，分类排队，在弄清了适龄空怀母畜的分布与健康状况以后，制定了配种规划。对占适龄母畜总数4％的瘦弱空怀母畜，普遍采取了减轻使役、加喂精料等措施，促使它们提早发情。晋中专区还普遍推广了人工催情的经验，因此大大加快了配种速度。
    为了使配种站和种公畜分布合理，便于及时配种，各地除对现有的二千三百多个大牲畜配种站进行了调整外，晋南、晋北两个专区还新增设了许多配种站，使全省每个人民公社和较大的管理区都有了配种站。各地公社对现有的二万零三百头优良种公畜，也根据空怀母畜的分布情况，有计划地进行调剂，防止了过去母畜跑路远影响受胎的现象发生。
    各地为了把春季大牲畜配种工作推向一个新的高潮，站与站、社与社、管理区与管理区、人与人之间普遍展开了“一全、二高、三快、四好”（即全配；受胎率高、种畜利用率高；母畜发情快、配种快、受胎快；母畜发情好，种畜调剂好、种畜和母畜饲养管理好）为中心内容的全配满怀竞赛。配种员们人人千方百计地采用热配、复配、多次配、连续配等办法，提高母畜受胎率。各地人民公社和许多机关、厂矿、运输部门都减少和减轻了母畜的劳动时间和强度，以利于发情配种。有的人民公社和管理区还把母畜的配种、休息、使役等三种权利交给饲养人员，并且实行了定人、定任务、定时间、定报酬的办法，解决了配种和使役的矛盾，同时提高饲养员对大牲畜配种繁殖的积极性。
    新华社长春28日电　开春以来，吉林省畜牧业战线上的形势空前良好。全省牛马骡驴等大家畜越冬后体壮膘肥，历史上牲畜越冬降膘的情况大大改变。同时，对怀胎母畜的接产工作，也比往年提前两个多月开始。
    今年吉林各地母畜提早产仔，是去年实行早春配种的结果。为了进一步推广早春配种的经验，使适龄母畜个个一年一产，各国营种马场，早在1月份就为各地人民公社的一千八百三十一处配种站，训练了二千二百多名配种员，使许多地方提前开始配种。大安县平安人民公社已配完母牛二百五十头，并且全部配准怀胎。
    吉林省畜牧业生产开春一片红，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。去年，各地人民公社依靠一大二公的优越条件，普遍组织了畜牧业生产专业队，建立牧场和配种网，坚持常年配种，大大提高了母畜受胎率。据统计，去年适龄母畜受胎率高达70％，比1958年高10％。入冬后，各地人民公社普遍开展了以保膘、保胎、全生、全活为内容的爱畜保畜运动，采取很多有效措施，加强了牲畜越冬的饲养管理工作。为了防止牲畜遭受冻害，去冬各地都大建圈棚，仅东丰、双辽、辽源等三个县、市就修建畜舍一千五百零六处。东丰县的三万八千头牲畜全部入舍，免除了严寒的侵害。各地还对老畜、弱畜、孕畜、幼畜特别加强了越冬饲养管理，普遍实行分群放牧、分圈管理、分槽饲养、分别加草加料、喂夜草饮夜水等办法，使这些牲畜都比去年同时期增膘二成多。为了防止孕畜流产，各地还采取减轻使役和不使役的办法，进行保胎，因此，全省流产的母畜比去年下降了10％左右。同时各公社的畜牧场都建立了接产室，为给母畜接产作了周密的准备。
    为了力争牲畜增殖全年红，现在全省各地人民公社都已抽调大批干部，深入牧场和生产队检查指导接产、配种、饲养管理等工作。各地兽医站的防治人员也采取巡回检查的方法，加强了春季畜疫防治工作。
