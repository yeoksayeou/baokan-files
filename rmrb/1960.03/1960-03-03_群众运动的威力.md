    The Power of Mass Movements
    Huang Jingbo, Member of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province

    In 1959, under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the victory over extraordinary disasters and the achievement of a bumper harvest on the agricultural front, the vast masses and cadres, with soaring enthusiasm and unprecedented speed, comprehensively overfulfilled the task of purchasing agricultural products thirty-two days ahead of schedule in Shaanxi Province.
        Brilliant Results
    Last year, the agricultural product purchasing work in Shaanxi Province, due to the early, tight, detailed, and solid efforts of Party committees and governments at all levels, was completed in a shorter time, with greater speed, larger quantities, and better quality. The movement started in mid-October last year, reached a climax in late October, and by the end of the month, the grain purchase task was overfulfilled first. Especially after the National Agricultural Product Purchase Broadcast Conference held on November 6th last year, the whole Party and the whole people mobilized, working hard for twenty days, and comprehensively overfulfilled the task. The completion status is as follows: The total value of agricultural product purchases (excluding grain) was overfulfilled thirty-two days ahead of schedule on November 28th last year. The grain requisition task assigned by the Central Government was overfulfilled more than seven months ahead of schedule by the end of October last year; cotton completed the purchase task on December 3rd last year, eight months ahead of schedule; edible oilseeds completed the task on November 21st last year, more than seven months ahead of schedule. Other products such as live pigs, goats, and poultry were also overfulfilled ahead of schedule.
    The agricultural products purchased in Shaanxi Province last year were not only large in quantity but also of good quality. In 1958, medium-grade grain accounted for 60% of the autumn grain stored, lower-grade grain accounted for 30%, and higher-grade grain was very little. Last year, 80% to 90% of the autumn grain stored was medium-to-high grade, and lower-grade grain was very little. Most of the cotton purchased was of the fourth and fifth grades. The purchase work focused on grain, cotton, and oil, grasping both the large and the small; grasping both the main varieties and the scattered varieties; grasping both the home-grown and the wild. After the Provincial Party Committee convened a diversified economy conference in November last year, 800,000 people in the province engaged in diversified economy, and the production, collection, and processing of local and sideline products has formed a climax.
    Taking agricultural product purchases as the center, the entire financial and trade work was greatly promoted. Under the premise of abiding by the Party's policies, the financial revenue target was overfulfilled more than sixty days ahead of schedule on October 26th last year; the credit withdrawal task was overfulfilled more than forty days ahead of schedule on November 19th last year. After selling agricultural products, the income of the members greatly increased. In addition to purchasing production and living materials, they also actively participated in patriotic savings.
    Characteristics of the Purchase Work
    The characteristics of the agricultural product purchasing work in Shaanxi Province are mainly: supporting industrial and agricultural production; properly arranging the people's lives; planned use of grain and economical use of grain; and the close combination of agricultural product purchasing, processing, transportation, and storage.
    Through purchasing, production has been greatly promoted and supported. During the critical period of agricultural product purchasing, the whole Party mobilized, went all out, seized the opportunity, and rushed to complete the task, which greatly shortened the time for centralized purchasing in autumn, so that the whole Party and the whole people could free up their hands to concentrate their efforts on production. At the same time, after the completion of the purchasing task, the financial and trade departments can also free up their hands earlier to take supporting production as the central task, which also plays a significant role in ensuring the development of production. (Of course, the task of regular purchasing throughout the year cannot be relaxed.) Precisely because the purchasing work is beneficial to production, although the task is tight and the work is heavy during the purchasing movement, the cadres and the masses are all in a good mood, work happily, and become more and more energetic.
    While the Party committee was focusing on agricultural product purchasing, it also properly arranged the people's lives, closely combining distribution, purchasing, and saving. In accordance with the principle of taking into account the interests of the state, the commune, the production team, and the members, all localities started with arranging production and life, and retained enough grain, cotton, oil, and other products according to national regulations, properly arranging the people's lives. Now, all 176,676 rural canteens in the province have realized planned grain consumption; 135,800 rural canteens have adopted new methods of cooking, accounting for 76% of the total number of canteens, saving 385.32 million catties of grain. Saving grain has become a common practice among the masses. At the same time, commercial departments have distributed means of production and means of livelihood to the countryside in a timely manner. Because we grasped both purchasing and distribution from the beginning of the purchasing movement, the policies were implemented in a deep, specific, and comprehensive manner. Precisely because the portion of members' self-retention for their own use was properly arranged, and arranged in a timely and reasonable manner, combining the interests of the state, the commune, the production team, and the members, the masses rushed to sell agricultural products, so that the purchasing task could be overfulfilled ahead of schedule.
    The purchasing, processing, transportation, and storage of agricultural products are closely related to the purchasing work. These tasks can be closely linked together, and the purchasing work can be accelerated. Relevant departments in Shaanxi Province have attached importance to this issue. While purchasing, they also seized other links. For processing work, special attention was paid to improving the oil yield. During the purchasing period, communes and production teams organized professional transportation teams to carry out short-distance transportation movements, contracting for the transportation of materials; transportation departments closely combined with purchasing departments, so that agricultural products were quickly concentrated and transported to the designated locations by the state, ensuring the timely transfer of materials. For the storage of materials, according to the characteristics of the purchase, all localities mobilized the masses to find ways, innovate technologies, and expand warehouse capacity, thereby solving the difficulty of insufficient warehouses. When purchasing, according to the different dryness and wetness of agricultural products, they were collected and stored separately to ensure that materials were not damaged.
      Experience in Purchasing Work
    Based on the creations of Party committees at all levels and the masses, we have summarized the following experiences:
      1. The Party committee strengthens leadership, the secretary takes command, does a good job in political and ideological work, and opposes right-leaning conservative thinking.
    Of all the measures, the leadership of the Party committee is the first. In the purchasing work in Shaanxi Province, the Party committee strengthened its leadership over the agricultural product purchasing work, achieving the command of the four secretaries (county party secretary, commune party committee secretary, management area general branch secretary, and production team branch secretary). The Party committee included the purchasing work in the main agenda, with the first secretary of the county party committee grasping it comprehensively, and the secretary and county magistrate in charge of financial and trade work grasping it frequently. During the sprint period, the first secretary of the county party committee personally took command, personally grasping ideology, policies, timing, and tasks. Organize inspection and supervision groups, assign areas to be responsible for, so that each area has someone responsible and each item has someone leading, so that tasks are implemented. The secretaries of the commune, management area, and production team personally went into battle, acting as both commanders and purchasing agricultural products, twisting the leadership and the masses into one force, ensuring the Party's strong leadership over the movement, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and members, so that the purchasing work can be carried out quickly.
    In leading the purchasing work, the Party committee insisted on publicizing policies first and doing ideological work first. Constantly and deeply oppose right-leaning and encourage vigor. Party committees in various localities carried out the struggle between the two roads among the masses. At the same time, in response to various ideas in various periods, various regions, and various types, resolutely boosted morale among cadres; resolutely reversed the fear of difficulties and enhanced confidence in completing tasks. For example, many counties and cities such as Xianyang City overcame various erroneous ideas by presenting facts and reasoning, so that the purchasing work progressed quickly.
    The purchasing departments in various localities paid attention to publicizing policies. They organized propaganda teams, turning purchasing personnel into propagandists, and using forms such as broadcast meetings, telephone meetings, mobilization meetings, and report meetings to publicize policies and eliminate concerns. They not only completed the task but also correctly implemented the policies. Facts have proved that as long as the publicity work is done thoroughly, the masses will consciously and actively sell products, and the purchasing task can be overfulfilled ahead of schedule.
      2. Rely on the masses and carry out a vigorous mass movement to sell agricultural products.
    The reason why the agricultural product purchasing work in the province was able to be completed early with more, faster, better, and more economical results, in addition to the Party committee strengthening leadership, was mainly due to the full utilization and development of the superiority of the people's communes, and the full mobilization and development of the subjective initiative and creativity of the masses. Make agricultural product purchasing a conscious action of hundreds of millions of people for the cause of patriotism and socialism. The scale and momentum of last year's agricultural product purchasing movement was unprecedented. About 140,000 cadres and more than 3 million laborers participated in the purchasing movement throughout the province, with more than 180,000 large carts, as well as hundreds of thousands of pack animals, bicycles, and handcarts. Because the masses were mobilized extensively and deeply, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, everyone was full of vigor, and everyone worked selflessly to complete the task ahead of schedule. On the evening of November 22nd last year, the revolutionary sacred land of Yan'an Prefecture dispatched more than 80,000 people and sold more than 7 million catties of grain overnight, rushing to complete the purchasing task. Hanzhong Prefecture dispatched more than 140,000 people to carry out agricultural product purchasing and the "small autumn harvest" movement. Many Party committee secretaries carried burdens of goods, held pig whips, did not avoid wind and rain, did not distinguish between day and night, and purchased, labored, and transported with the masses. Under their inspiration, the vast number of members actively sold agricultural products to support the country. These all show that as long as the masses are mobilized, recognize that selling agricultural products is beneficial to the country, beneficial to themselves; beneficial to the long-term, and also beneficial to the present, the purchasing task can be successfully completed.
    3. Insert red flags and set up pacesetters; carry out a mass competition movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced.
    The province organized opponent competitions between regions, departments, and individuals, comparing good implementation of policies, good completion of tasks, good work quality, good arrangement of people's lives, and good support for production. Implement the method of daily reporting, ten-day inspections, monthly evaluations, and rewards, establish advanced models, and promote the general. At the end of the purchasing work, conduct summaries and comprehensive evaluations at all levels. This will enable the vast number of masses to always maintain their vigorous enthusiasm and ensure that the purchasing movement starts well and ends well.
      4. Arrange in stages, distinguish priorities; link closely and fight quickly.
    During the sprint purchasing period, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers all went into battle, and all kinds of vehicles were dispatched, making the purchasing work lively. After the purchasing movement is launched, it is necessary to closely link each link and strike while the iron is hot. When the movement reaches a stage, immediately carry out rectification, inspection, and summary in ideology and organization, and then set off a climax. Such staged, classified, continuous sprinting purchases, always maintaining vigorous will, and setting off several climaxes, can comprehensively complete the task. Shangxian County adopted this method, carried out three mass sprint movements, and completed the purchase task of grain and other agricultural products at the end of October last year. On this basis, it is necessary to continue to seize the regular purchasing work.
    5. Increase manpower and set up points, purchase and supply at the same time, improve service attitude, and everything is for the convenience of the masses.
    In areas with few purchasing points and insufficient purchasing personnel, it is necessary to increase purchasing points, widely organize delivery to the countryside, purchase door-to-door, and set up purchasing agents for each team; ensure that they are collected whenever they arrive, and how much is received; treat the masses with enthusiasm and think of the masses everywhere. The purchase price should be based on quality and fair transactions. While purchasing agricultural products, it is necessary to do a good job in supplying production and living materials. So that purchasing guarantees supply, and supply promotes purchasing, purchasing and supply simultaneously meet the needs of the masses and promote production.
    Although we have achieved great results in agricultural product purchasing, we must not be satisfied with this. We must continue to oppose right-leaning and encourage vigor, start well and end well, leave no tails, and resolutely do a good job in the later stages of agricultural product purchasing. At present, the people of the province are continuing to make persistent efforts and advance victoriously. On the one hand, continue to focus on the purchase of unfinished scattered agricultural products, especially in coordination with diversified operations, vigorously purchase mountain goods and local specialties, and strive to overfulfill the purchase task. On the other hand, it is necessary to carefully review and arrange the people's lives, do a good job in supplying materials in every possible way, and welcome the large-scale spring plowing production movement that is about to come.

    群众运动的威力
    中共陕西省委委员、陕西省副省长　黄静波
    陕西省1959年的农产品收购工作，在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，在党中央和中共陕西省委的领导下，在农业战线上战胜特大灾害而获得丰收的情况下，广大群众和干部以冲天的干劲、空前的速度，提前三十二天全面超额完成任务。
        辉煌的成果
    去年陕西省的农产品收购工作，由于各级党政抓得早、抓得紧、抓得细、抓得实，因而完成任务的时间短、速度快、数量多、质量好。运动从去年10月中旬开始，下旬形成高潮，到月底粮食收购任务首先超额完成。特别是在去年11月6日召开全国农产品收购广播大会后，全党全民总动员，大干二十天，全面超额完成了任务。完成的情况是：农产品收购总值（不包括粮食）在去年11月28日提前三十二天超额完成。中央分配的粮食征购任务到去年10月底就提前七个多月超额完成；棉花在去年12月3日提前八个月完成收购任务；食用油料在去年11月21日提前七个多月完成任务。其他如生猪、菜羊、家禽也都超额提前完成。
    陕西省去年收购的农产品不仅数量大，而且质量好。1958年入库的秋粮中级粮占60％，下级粮占30％，上级粮很少。去年入库的秋粮80％—90％都是中上级粮，下级粮很少。收购的棉花，绝大部分是四、五级的。收购工作以粮、棉、油为中心，既抓大的，又抓小的；既抓主要品种，又抓零星品种；既抓家生的，又抓野生的。在省委去年11月召开了多种经营会议后，全省有八十万人大搞多种经营，土副产品的生产、采集和加工已形成高潮。
    以农产品收购为中心，大大带动了整个财贸工作。在遵守党的政策的前提下，财政收入指标在去年10月26日提前六十多天超额完成；信用回笼任务在去年11月19日提前四十多天超额完成。社员们在出售农产品后，收入大大增加。除了购买生产和生活资料外，还积极参加爱国储蓄。
    收购工作的特点
    陕西省农产品收购工作的特点，主要是：支援了工农业生产；妥善安排了人民生活；计划用粮，节约用粮；农产品的收购、加工、调运、保管的紧密结合。
    通过收购，大大地推动和支援了生产。在农产品收购的关键性时期，全党动员，全力以赴，抓紧时机，突击完成任务，使秋季的集中收购大大缩短时间，使全党全民能腾出手来集中力量搞生产。同时，在收购任务完成后，财贸部门也可以提早腾出手来，把支援生产作为中心任务，这对保证发展生产也起着重大的作用。（当然，一年四季经常收购的任务，也不能放松。）正由于收购工作有利于生产，在收购运动期间虽然任务紧，工作重，但干部和群众都心情舒畅，工作愉快，越干劲头越大。
    党委在大抓农产品收购的同时，还妥善地安排了人民生活，把分配、收购、节约密切结合起来了。各地根据国家、公社、生产队、社员四兼顾的原则，从安排生产和生活入手，按照国家规定留够了应留部分的粮、棉、油和其他产品，妥善地安排了人民生活。现在全省有十七万六千六百七十六个农村食堂全部实现计划用粮；有十三万五千八百个农村食堂采用了新法做饭，占食堂总数的76％，节约粮食三亿八千五百三十二万斤。节约粮食已成为广大群众的一种风气。同时，商业部门把生产资料和生活资料及时下放到农村。由于在收购运动一开始就一手抓收购，一手抓分配，因而将政策贯彻得深入、具体、全面。正由于妥善的安排了社员自留自用的部分，并安排得及时、合理，把国家、公社、生产队、社员四者利益结合在一起，因而群众争先恐后地交售农产品，使收购任务能提前超额完成。
    农产品的收购、加工、调运、保管和收购工作有着密切关系。这些工作能够环环扣紧，紧密结合，收购工作就能加快。陕西省有关部门重视了这一问题。在收购的同时，也抓紧了其他环节。对于加工工作，特别注意了提高出油率。在收购期间，公社和生产队组织了专业运输队，开展短途运输运动，包干运输物资；交通运输部门与收购部门密切结合，使农产品很快集中运送到国家指定地点，保证物资及时外调。对于物资保管工作，各地根据收购特点，发动群众想办法，革新技术，扩大仓库容量，从而解决了仓库不足的困难。在收购时，根据农产品干湿的不同情况，分收、分存，保证物资不受损失。
      收购工作的经验
    我们根据各级党委和群众的创造，总结了以下经验：
      一、党委加强领导，书记挂帅，做好政治思想工作，反对右倾保守思想。
    千条万条，党委领导是第一条。陕西省在收购工作中，加强了党委对农产品收购工作的领导，做到四书（县委书记、公社党委书记、管理区总支书记、生产队支部书记）挂帅。党委把收购工作列入主要议事日程，县委第一书记全面抓，主管财贸工作的书记和县长经常抓。在突击时期，县委第一书记亲自挂帅，亲自抓思想、抓政策、抓时机、抓任务。组织检查督导团，分片包干，做到块块有人负责，条条有人领导，使任务落实。公社、管理区、生产队的书记亲自上阵，一面当指挥，一面收购农产品，把领导和群众扭成一股劲，保证党对运动的坚强领导，充分发挥广大职工和社员的积极性，使收购工作能迅速地开展。
    党委在领导收购工作中，做到宣传政策在先，思想工作在先。不断深入地反右倾、鼓干劲。各地党委在群众中开展两条道路的斗争。同时，针对各个时期、各个地区、各种不同思想，在干部中坚决鼓舞士气；坚决反掉畏难情绪，增强完成任务的信心。如咸阳市等许多县、市，通过摆事实，讲道理，克服了各种错误思想，使收购工作进展得很快。
    各地收购部门注意宣传政策，他们组织宣传大军，把收购人员变为宣传员，利用广播会、电话会、誓师会、报告会等形式，宣传政策，清除顾虑。做到既完成了任务，又正确贯彻了政策。事实证明，只要宣传工作作得深透，群众就一定会自觉地积极地交售产品，收购任务就可以提前超额完成。
      二、依靠群众，开展声势浩大的群众出售农产品运动。
    全省农产品收购工作所以能够多、快、好、省地提前完成，除了党委加强领导，主要是充分利用和发挥了人民公社的优越性，充分调动和发挥了群众的主观能动性和创造性。使农产品收购工作变成千百万群众爱国、爱社会主义事业的自觉行动。去年农产品收购运动的规模和声势之大是空前的。全省参加收购运动的干部约有十四万多人，劳力在三百万人以上，出动的大车在十八万辆以上，还有驮畜和自行车、人力车几十万辆。由于深入广泛地发动了群众，从党内到党外、从干部到群众，个个干劲冲天，大家为提前全面完成任务忘我地劳动着。革命圣地延安专区在去年11月22日晚上，出动八万多人，一夜交售粮食七百多万斤，突击完成了收购任务。汉中专区出动了十四万多人，大搞农产品收购和“小秋收”运动。许多党委书记肩挑货郎担，手拿赶猪鞭，不避风雨、不分昼夜，和群众同收购、同劳动、同运送。在他们的感召下，广大社员积极出售农产品支援国家。这些都说明了，只要群众发动起来了，认识到交售农产品对国家有利，对自己有利；对长远有利，对目前也有利，收购任务都能胜利地完成。
    三、要插红旗、树标兵；开展学先进、赶先进、超先进的群众竞赛运动。
    全省组织地区、部门、个人之间的对手赛，比执行政策好，比任务完成好，比工作质量好，比人民生活安排好，比支援生产好。实行日汇报、旬检查、月评比和奖励的办法，树立先进，推动一般。在收购工作结束时，层层进行总结，全面评比。这样就能使广大群众一直保持旺盛的热情，保证收购运动善始善终。
      四、要分段安排、分清主次；环环扣紧，速战速决。
    在突击收购时期，工农商学兵全面上阵，大小车辆齐出动，使收购工作搞得轰轰烈烈。在收购运动开展后，要环环扣紧，趁热打铁。在运动到一阶段时，就立即在思想、组织上进行整顿，检查总结，再掀起高潮。这样分段、分类连续不断地突击收购，始终保持旺盛的意志，掀起几次高潮，就能全面完成任务。商县就是采取这种办法，搞了三次群众性突击运动，在去年10月底就完成了粮食和其他农产品收购任务。在这个基础上，还要继续抓紧经常的收购工作。
    五、要增人设点，边收购、边供应，改进服务态度，一切为了便利群众。
    在收购点少、收购人员不足的地区，要增加收购点，广泛组织送货下乡，登门收购，队队设代购员；做到什么时候到，什么时候收；到多少，收多少，要热情对待群众，处处为群众着想。收购价格要依质论价，公平交易。在收购农产品的同时，要做好供应生产和生活资料工作。使收购保证了供应，供应又促进了收购，收购和供应同时满足群众需要，促进了生产。
    我们虽然在农产品收购方面取得了巨大的成绩，但决不因此而满足，还必须在继续反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，善始善终，不留尾巴，坚决做好农产品收购的后期工作。目前全省人民正再接再厉，乘胜前进。一方面继续大抓未完成的零散农产品的收购，特别是配合多种经营，大力收购山货土特产品，争取超额完成收购任务。另一方面要认真复查和安排好人民生活，千方百计地作好物资供应工作，迎接即将来到的大规模春耕生产运动。
