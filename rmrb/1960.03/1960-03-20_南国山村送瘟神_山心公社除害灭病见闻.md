Sending Away the God of Plague in a Southern Mountain Village
—Observations from the Elimination of Pests and Diseases in Shanxin People's Commune
By our reporter Yao Yange

Spring comes early to the South, and the rice seedlings are green in the fields. On an early morning in March, I traveled through the bustling countryside and arrived at Shanxin People's Commune in Yulin County, Guangxi, a well-known advanced unit in eliminating pests and diseases.

The Diligent Manure Manager

As soon as I entered the commune, I saw Ning Hanqi, the nearly fifty-year-old manure manager of the Third Production Team of Minghui Brigade, "tidying up and dressing up" the Shanxin Commune. He gets up earlier than anyone else every day, and works harder than anyone else. He is in charge of fourteen toilets, over one hundred manure pits, and two garbage dumps. He not only cleans them every day but also uses a high-temperature composting method, which kills various disease-causing insect eggs and increases fertilizer efficiency. In his words: the manure manager is like a doctor, eliminating the source of infectious diseases and changing environmental hygiene.

In the past, in Shanxin Village, every household had cattle pens and pigsties right inside the door, people and animals lived together, and manure pits were everywhere. In summer, mosquitoes, flies, and maggots would gather in large numbers, and diseases were constant. Now, walking into the village, a fresh and pleasant feeling arises spontaneously. The snow-white earthen walls are adorned with colorful murals, the streets paved with gravel are smooth and clean, and streams of mountain water flow through the ditches, washing away the dirt. The houses on both sides of the street, no matter which one you go to, are clean and spotless. From the beginning of the street to the end of the alley, you can't find a single trace of phlegm or feces, and you can't smell any odor. People and animals no longer live together, and pig and cattle pens have been moved to the hillsides and fields. The old manure pits in every household have been filled in, and more than three thousand new manure pits, both large and small, have been built, all sealed and covered. The more than two hundred and thirty new-style public toilets not only have clean wooden lids and are flushed with clean water, but the toilets close to the houses are also equipped with snow-white screen doors. Seeing all this, I have even greater respect for this old man. It is his selfless labor that has changed the face of this place, one person for everyone, and everyone respects one person.

"Life Was Given to Me by the Party"

Li Hanhua, this "half-dead resurrected" hookworm patient, everyone in Shanxin Commune knows her. At noon, when I arrived at Minghui Brigade, she had just returned from transplanting rice seedlings in the field. Her dark hair and dark red hands and feet showed that she was a typical Guangxi working woman who could carry heavy loads and do good work.

Ten years ago, when Li Hanhua was in her twenties, everyone said: "She is a production expert." However, soon she contracted hookworm disease, and everything changed. She felt her heart beat fast and her head was dizzy when doing heavy work, and she didn't have the strength to carry a load. When she became seriously ill in 1955, she was swollen all over, her hair fell out, and she couldn't even carry twenty pounds. The agricultural cooperative asked her to look after an old buffalo, but she couldn't even keep up with it, and she had to pull on the buffalo's tail to climb a small slope. At that time, the doctors in the cooperative did not understand the root cause of this disease, and although she took a basketful of prescriptions, the disease continued to worsen. People in the village said that she would not get better. Li Hanhua lay in bed, thinking: "I won't be able to live to see socialism." In 1958, when the county began to treat hookworm disease on a large scale, the doctor Ning Jincai gave her medicine. She said in despair, "I have taken so much medicine and still can't get better, can you cure me?" After a year of repeated treatment with effective drugs such as tetrachloroethylene by the commune and the brigade, she quickly recovered her health. Now, she can carry a heavy load of one hundred and twenty pounds, earns more than two hundred work points every month, and has given birth to her third child. When people mention the prevention and treatment of hookworm disease, she gratefully sheds tears: "My life was given to me by the Party, and my drive was given to me by Chairman Mao."

The Story of "Rebirth and Childbearing"

In Shanxin Commune, there is a story circulating about "rebirth and childbearing."

Fifteen years ago, young Lu Jiaying married a young farmer in the village. Although life was hard at the time, the newlyweds were happy. In the morning, Jiaying and her husband went to the fields together, and when they came back in the evening, they helped her elderly mother-in-law with household chores. Jiaying thought: "I'll have a baby in a year or so, and the family will be lively." However, things did not go as planned. In that era of poverty and disease, she contracted hookworm disease. The disease made her thin, exhausted her strength, and deprived her of her ability to have children. At first, her husband and mother-in-law thought that Jiaying was suffering from some gynecological disease because she had been engaged in heavy labor for many years, and they didn't care. However, the harmful hookworm disease did not improve for several years. Her husband, who had been asking for doctors and medicine, knew that the disease was difficult to cure and began to sigh in disappointment: "Bad luck, I married a useless sick woman." The mother-in-law, who was eagerly hoping for a grandson, couldn't hold back her anger and complained all day long. Jiaying cried secretly when she heard these words. In 1958, when she heard the news that people from the county had come to treat hookworm disease, she was overjoyed and immediately sought medical treatment. She never dreamed that this treatment would restore her youth and eliminate the hidden pain that had been accumulated in her heart for many years. In September of last year, her first child was born. The mother-in-law looked at her healthy daughter-in-law and her chubby granddaughter, and she was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth. Her husband was even more considerate and affectionate.

Zhou Zhencai, a fifty-four-year-old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Shanxin Commune, told me that there was a plague before liberation, and more than fifty people died in one go in just eight or nine households on Guhang Street. More than 70% of the entire commune contracted hookworm disease every year. At that time, there was a folk song circulating nearby:

Shanxin's people are poor and bare,
Life is hard, and disease is difficult to bear,
Half a year of chaff and vegetables in the stomach to wear.
Men are thin and difficult to produce,
Women are pale and lazy to dress.
Men don't marry Shanxin women,
Women don't marry Shanxin men.

However, these miserable lives have become historical relics. Now, hookworm disease has been basically eliminated here, and many swollen patients who had been tossing and turning on their beds, like Li Hanhua and Lu Jiaying, have recovered their health. More than 28,700 people in the entire commune with varying degrees of hookworm disease have eliminated their diseases, and the attendance rate of commune members has increased from 85% in 1957 to 99% last year.

    南国山村送瘟神
    ——山心公社除害灭病见闻
    本报记者　姚燕戈
    春到南国早，秧绿满田间。3月初的一天早晨，我穿过喧闹的山野，来到了广西著名的除害灭病先进单位——玉林县山心人民公社。
    辛勤的粪便管理员
    一走进公社，就看到鸣水大队第三生产队年近五十的粪便管理员宁汉琪，在给山心公社“梳洗、打扮”。他每天比谁起得都早，干劲比谁都大，一人管十四个厕所、一百多个粪坑和两个垃圾堆，不但做到天天清理，还采用了高温沤肥法，既能杀死各种病害虫卵，又增加了肥效。用他的话来说：粪便管理员就是医生，消灭了传染病的根源，改变了环境卫生。
    过去的山心村，家家进门就是牛栏、猪圈，人畜同居，粪坑遍地，一到夏天，蚊、蝇、蛆大“聚会”，疾病常年不断。现在，走进村来，一股清新、舒畅的感觉使人油然而生。雪白的土墙上，彩色的壁画琳琅满目，砂石铺成的街道，平整光洁，水沟里流着冲刷污物的涓涓山水。街巷两旁的住房，随便你走到哪家，都是窗明几净，一尘不染。从街头到巷尾，找不到一点痰迹、粪尿，闻不到一点臭味。这里早已改变了人畜同居的习惯，猪、牛栏迁到了山坡、田间。填平了家家户户的旧粪坑，新建了大、小三千多个粪坑，全部密封加盖。二百三十多个新式公共厕所，不但有干净的木盖，清水冲洗，靠近住房的厕所还装有雪白的纱门。看到这一切，越发对这位老人倍增敬佩。是他的忘我劳动改变了这里的面貌，一人为大家，大家敬一人。
    “生命是党给我的”
    李汉华，这个“半死复生”的钩虫病人，提起她来，山心公社没有不知道的。中午，我来到鸣水大队时，她刚从田里插秧回来。她那乌黑的头发，黑红的手脚，一看就知道是个能挑善担的典型的广西劳动妇女。
    十年前，二十多岁的李汉华，谁见了都说：“是个生产能手”。可是，不久她就感染上了钩虫病，从此一切都变了样，做重活心跳头晕，担起担子没有力气。到1955年病重时，通身浮肿，头发脱落，不但担不起二十斤，连农业社让她看一头老水牛都追不上，上小坡还得拉着牛尾巴才能上去。当时，社里的医生不懂这种病的根源，尽管她服的药方有一篓筐，但病仍是有增无减，村里的人都说她不会好了。李汉华躺在床上，心里想：“过不了社会主义了。”1958年县里开始大规模治疗钩虫病时，医生宁进才让她服药时，她绝望地说：“我吃了这么多药都治不好，你们能医好么？”经过公社、大队一年来用四氯乙稀等有效药的反复治疗，她很快就恢复了健康。现在，她一担就是一百二十斤的重担，每月都超过二百多个工分，并且生了第三个孩子。当人们一提起防治钩虫病时，她就感激地流出了泪花：“命是党给我的，干劲是毛主席送我的。”
    “再生得子”的故事
    在山心公社，流传着一个“再生得子”的故事。
    十五年前，年轻的卢家英和本村青年农民结婚了，当时的生活虽苦，但新婚也给青年夫妇带来了幸福。早上，家英和丈夫一起下田，晚上回来，帮助年老的婆母料理家务，家英想：“过一年半载再生个孩子，家里就热闹了。”但是，事与愿违，在那贫病交加的年代，她感染上了钩虫病，病魔使她消瘦了，力气耗尽了，还剥夺了她的生育能力。起初，丈夫、婆母还以为家英常年参加繁重的劳动，害些妇女病，没有介意，可是害人的钩虫病一连几年不见好转，问医取药的丈夫知道病难治好，开始灰心叹气：“命不好，娶了个不中用的病婆。”切盼孙子的婆婆更是压不住气，整天埋怨。家英听到这些话，暗暗流泪。1958年，当听到县里来人治疗钩虫病的消息后，她高兴极了，马上求医治疗。她作梦也想不到经过这次治疗会恢复了青春，消除了积在心里多年的隐痛。去年9月里，第一个孩子出世了，婆婆看着健壮的儿媳和胖胖的孙女，高兴得合不拢嘴，丈夫更是体贴、抚爱。
    山心公社五十四岁的老中医周箴才告诉我，解放前一年闹瘟灾，仅谷行街八九户人家一回就死了五十多人，全社每年感染上钩虫病的就有70％以上。当时，附近流行着这样一首民谣：
    山心方，穷得光，
    生活苦，病难当，半年糠菜肚里装。
    男人消瘦难生产，女人面黄懒梳妆。
    有男不娶山心女，有女不嫁山心郎。
    但是，这些凄惨的生活已成了历史的陈迹。现在，这里的钩虫病基本消灭了，多少个辗转床褥的黄肿病人，像李汉华、卢家英一样恢复了健康。全社有二万八千七百多个不同程度的钩虫病人消除了疾病，社员的出勤率由1957年的85％上升到去年的99％。（附图片）
