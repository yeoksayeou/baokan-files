Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 15th: (Reporter Zhang Yang) The ten-nation East-West disarmament conference opened here at the League of Nations building on the afternoon of the 15th. This is the first international negotiation on general disarmament since 1957. At that time, the United Nations Disarmament Commission interrupted its work without reaching any agreement because the Western countries lacked a genuine desire for disarmament.

Unlike the situation before 1957 when only the Soviet Union faced Western countries alone at disarmament conferences, today delegations from five socialist countries—the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria—are sitting together at the conference table to negotiate with representatives from the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Italy for comprehensive and complete disarmament. This reflects the changes in the international balance of power in recent years that are favorable to the socialist camp.

Currently, not only socialist countries and newly independent nationalist countries hope for disarmament, but people all over the world are also increasingly strongly demanding disarmament. The people of Western countries hope to get rid of the unbearable burden of armaments imposed on them by their own governments. This is why the Western countries, especially the United States, which have been hindering the progress of disarmament issues in the dozen years of negotiations after World War II, now have to agree to resume disarmament negotiations.

On the eve of the disarmament conference, the United States announced the Western joint "disarmament" plan, which was drafted by the five Western countries after two months of repeated consultations and approved by the North Atlantic Group Council. This plan exposes the Western countries' attempt to participate in the Geneva conference. Judging from this plan, what the West wants is supervision, not disarmament. The West emphasizes supervision to an absurd degree in order to cover up their sinister intention of being unwilling to disarm and deliberately obstructing the reaching of an agreement.

In contrast to the disarmament plan proposed by the Soviet Union, the Western plan mentions a lot of "joint research" and "further joint research" without any time limits. Combined with the so-called remarks intentionally spread by American officials that this meeting will be held for "several years," one cannot help but get the impression that the West is once again planning to adopt its usual delaying tactics. The West is so keen on military intelligence that its plan initially emphasizes the need to "collect information on current force levels and armaments."

In the minds of the people of the world, stopping nuclear weapons tests is an important and urgent issue. However, the disarmament plan proposed by the United States completely avoids the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests. The Western plan does not mention the abolition of military bases in foreign countries, although this is one of the main reasons for international tensions.

The Western proposal to establish an "international police force," which Western newspapers describe as an in-depth investigation into the internal affairs of other countries, can only constitute an infringement on the sovereignty of other countries.

In his opening speech at the disarmament conference, Zorin, the head of the Soviet delegation, pointed out: "At present, there is still a stubborn force in the world that opposes genuine disarmament. These people are not only trying to prevent the realization of comprehensive and complete disarmament, but are also taking measures to further intensify the arms race."

The Soviet delegation stated that the Soviet Union is willing to consider various supplementary and revised opinions and other suggestions on the Soviet Union's comprehensive and complete disarmament plan in order to formulate an agreement.

### 西方提出不愿裁军的“裁军”方案

    西方提出不愿裁军的“裁军”方案
    避而不谈停止核武器试验和取消军事基地问题
    特别热衷搜集军事情报和建立“国际警察部队”
  新华社日内瓦15日电　本社记者张扬报道：东西方十国裁军会议15日下午在这里的国联大厦开幕。这是1957年以来第一次关于普遍裁军的国际谈判，当时由于西方国家缺乏真正裁军的愿望，联合国裁军委员会没有达成任何协议就中断了工作。
    同1957年以前在裁军会议上只有苏联单独面对西方国家的情况不同，今天五个社会主义国家——苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的代表团一起坐在会议桌前为了全面彻底裁减军备而同美国、英国、法国、加拿大和意大利的代表谈判。这反映了最近几年国际力量对比发生了有利于社会主义阵营的变化。
    目前，不仅是社会主义国家和新独立的民族主义国家希望裁军，全世界各地的人民都日益强烈地要求实现裁军。西方国家的人民希望摆脱他们自己的政府强加在他们身上的负担不了的军备重担。这就是在第二次世界大战后十几年的谈判中一直阻挠裁军问题进展的西方国家，特别是美国，目前不得不同意恢复裁军谈判的原因。
    裁军会议开幕前夕，美国公布了西方五国经过两个月反复磋商后拟订并经北大西洋集团理事会批准的西方联合“裁军”计划。这个计划暴露了西方国家参加日内瓦会议的企图。从这个计划看，西方要的是监督而不是裁军。西方所以把监督强调到荒谬的程度，这是为了要掩盖它们不愿裁军、故意阻挠达成协议的罪恶的意图。
    同苏联提出的裁军的计划正相反，西方的计划提到很多“共同研究”和“进一步的共同研究”，而没有任何时间上的限制。和美国官员有意散布的所谓这次会议将会举行“几年”的这种言论联一起，不由得不使人产生这种印象：西方又打算采取它一贯运用的拖延策略。西方是这样热衷于军事情报，所以它们的计划一开始就强调要“收集关于目前的武力水平和军备的情报”。
    在世界人民心目中，停止核武器试验是一个重要而迫切的问题。但是美国提出的裁军计划根本避开停止核武器试验问题。西方计划中只字不提取消在外国的军事基地，虽然这是造成国际紧张局势主要原因之一。
    西方提出的关于成立被西方报纸说成是深入调查其它国家内政的“国际警察部队”的计划，只能构成对其它国家主权的侵犯。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在裁军会议开幕词中指出：“目前世界上还有一股顽固地反对真正裁军的势力。这些人不仅企图阻止实现全面彻底裁军，而且还采取措施进一步加紧军备竞赛。”
    苏联代表团说，苏联愿意考虑对苏联的全面彻底裁军计划提出的各种补充和修正意见及其它建议，以便拟订一项协议。
