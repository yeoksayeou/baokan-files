Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, March 21st: U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates arrived in Bonn today to hold talks with West German Defense Minister Strauss.

The content of the talks has not been made public here. It is believed that the meeting is in preparation for the NATO Defense Ministers' meeting to be held in Paris at the end of this month. According to West Germany's Deutsche Presse-Agentur, the focus of the talks is the "practical issues of NATO's defense policy" and the Bonn government's demand for "integration" of NATO's military supplies.

Since the plan for West Germany to establish military bases in Spain was revealed, Strauss has repeatedly clamored for the "integration" of military supplies of NATO member states. This is actually to obtain a "legitimate" basis for West Germany's activities in establishing military bases abroad within NATO. The Bonn government has submitted a memorandum to the member states of this military bloc, requesting that this issue be discussed at the upcoming meeting of the group's defense ministers. This attitude of West Germany has aroused strong reactions in its NATO allies. It is revealed that during today's talks, Strauss reiterated to his American colleague that if West Germany is to complete the tasks assigned by NATO – to build twelve well-trained divisions – it must obtain supply and training bases outside its territory, because there is "not enough space" in West Germany. Gates assured the West German Defense Minister that the United States would do its best to work within NATO to help West Germany solve its base problem.

Gates will visit West Germany for four days. He will "inspect" the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany. He will also go to West Berlin on the 24th for a "visit".

    美国支持西德军事扩张
    两国国防部长在波恩开始会谈
    新华社波恩21日电　美国国防部长盖茨今天到波恩同西德国防部长施特劳斯会谈。
    这里没有公布会谈内容。人们认为，这次会谈是为本月底在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团国防部长会议作准备。据西德德意志新闻社透露，会谈的中心是北大西洋集团“防御政策的现实问题”以及波恩政府要求北大西洋集团军事供应“一体化”的问题。
    自从西德要在西班牙建立军事基地的计划被揭露后，施特劳斯就一再叫喊要把北大西洋集团成员国的军事供应“一体化”，这其实就是要使西德在外国建立军事基地的活动在北大西洋集团中取得“合法的”依据。波恩政府已经向这个军事集团的成员国提出备忘录，要求在即将举行的这个集团的国防部长会议上讨论这一问题。西德的这种态度在它的北大西洋盟国内引起了强烈的反应。据透露，在今天的会谈中，施特劳斯再次向他的美国同僚表示，如果要西德完成北大西洋集团所规定的任务——建成十二个受过良好训练的师，它就必须在它的领土以外获得供应和训练的基地，因为在西德没有“足够的地方”。而盖茨则向这位西德国防部长保证说，美国将尽力在北大西洋集团内作工作，帮助西德解决它的基地问题。
    盖茨将在西德访问四天。他将“视察”驻西德的美军。他还将在24日到西柏林去“访问”。
