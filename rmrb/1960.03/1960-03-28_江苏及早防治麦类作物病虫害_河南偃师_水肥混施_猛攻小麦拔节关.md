Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 27th. Jiangsu is starting early and acting quickly in the prevention and control of wheat crop diseases and pests. Under the slogan of "Do not let go of a single disease or insect, do not miss treating a single wheat field," all wheat fields in the province affected by diseases and pests have been treated once by March 15th, and some wheat fields have been treated more than twice. At present, inspections and comparisons are being widely carried out to gradually deepen the prevention and control movement.

In view of the characteristics that the temperature was higher last winter and this spring, and the diseases and insect pests of wheat, barley, and oats may occur earlier, the party committees at all levels established prevention and control command organizations early and led the communes to prepare for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in advance. At present, more than 330,000 technicians for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests have been trained throughout the province, and 6,639 professional prevention and control teams have been established.

In order to achieve "sufficient medicine and complete machinery, be prepared for everything," all localities have produced pesticides and added and repaired pharmaceutical machinery early in accordance with the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." This year, the amount of sulfur and barium polysulfide prepared for the prevention of wheat diseases in the province is more than in the past. In addition, people's communes in various places have also built more than 17,700 indigenous pesticide factories, producing more than 200 million jin of indigenous pesticides. Spraying and dusting machines were also repaired in advance. As of March 15th, 71% of the pharmaceutical machinery that should be repaired has been repaired. In the repair of pharmaceutical machinery in Changshu, Tongshan, Pi County and other places, indigenous methods were used instead of foreign methods, using sandalwood that does not swell when exposed to water to process the water swirling plug of the sprayer, using ink bottle caps as sprinkler caps, using old galoshes cut into cushions to replace cowhide cushions, and using bamboo tubes instead of steel to make water pumping cylinders, etc., which made the repair work good and fast, and adapted to the needs of disease and pest control.

The forecasting and forecasting organizations for diseases and insect pests in various places have also developed. 166 forecasting and forecasting stations, 2,207 commune information points, and more than 57,000 informants have been established throughout the province, reaching an average of two stations per county, one to two points per commune, and two to three informants per brigade. A dragnet was laid for diseases and insects.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 27th. Yanshi County, Henan Province, on the basis of universally irrigating wheat with water to promote greening and successfully passing the greening stage, has comprehensively strengthened wheat field management and vigorously attacked the wheat jointing stage.

This year, the communes in Yanshi County grasped the field management during the wheat greening period early and fiercely, and the wheat seedlings in various places generally grew vigorously. Now that the vernal equinox has passed, the weather is gradually warming up, and the wheat is generally starting to joint, which is an important juncture in the mid-term management of wheat fields. Good management can enable wheat to produce more heads and grow large ears, but poor management will lead to yellowing or lodging. For this reason, after the spring rain, the communes were led by the secretaries to mobilize the members and set off a high tide of wheat field management centered on managing the third category of seedlings well. Generally, 30 to 60 dan of human manure and urine were applied per mu to the third category of wheat in various communes, striving to catch up with the first category of wheat at a high speed. The Dakou Brigade of Dakou Commune had 460 mu of yellow and thin wheat, and adopted the "water and fertilizer mixing method", organized twelve professional teams to open ditches and apply strips, and sealed them after application to maintain sufficient fertilizer efficiency, and the third category of seedlings quickly upgraded. At the same time, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied to the first and second categories of wheat to prevent lodging. The Dongsizhuang Brigade of Laocheng Commune regularly controlled the soil moisture content of the first category of wheat seedlings at 18%-20%; increased the application of 300 jin of plant ash and 500 to 1,000 jin of superphosphate per mu to prevent lodging; according to the experience of increasing production by spraying phosphate fertilizer last year, 20 jin of phosphate fertilizer per mu was sprayed on the first category of wheat seedlings with a sprayer. The communes also combined deep ploughing with soil preparation for wheat seedlings, according to the successful experience of "soil preparation to prevent lodging" in some brigades of Laocheng, Zhaizhen and other communes last year. Now, 300,000 mu of high-yield fields in the county have been universally cultivated with old wall soil, totaling about 10,000 jin per mu. The Yuetan Brigade of Zhaizhen Commune plans to cultivate the first category of seedlings three times, and has cultivated them twice, with 20,000 jin of soil per mu. Through the above-mentioned measures and scientific management, wheat throughout the county is developing and growing more vigorously.

Yanshi County also started early to prevent and control diseases, insect pests and natural disasters such as frost. (Attached picture)

    江苏及早防治麦类作物病虫害
    河南偃师“水肥混施”猛攻小麦拔节关
    新华社南京27日电　江苏各地防治麦类作物病虫害的工作，动手早，行动快。在“不放松一病一虫，不漏治一块麦田”的口号下，到3月15日为止，全省发生病虫害的麦田，已经普遍防治一次，部分麦田防治了两次以上。目前各地正在广泛开展检查评比，使防治运动逐步深入开展。
    根据去冬今春气温较高，小麦、元麦、大麦的病虫害有可能提早发生的特点，各级党委早就建立了防治指挥机构，领导各公社提早进行了防治病虫害的准备工作。目前各地已经训练了防治病虫害的技术员三十三万多人，建立防治专业队六千六百三十九个。
    为了做到“药足械齐，有备无患”，各地都根据“土洋并举”的方针，提早生产农药和添造、检修药械。今年全省准备防治麦病的硫磺和多硫化钡比过去充足。另外各地人民公社还建土农药厂一万七千七百多个，生产土农药二亿余斤。喷雾喷粉器也提前进行了修理。到3月15日止，应修的药械中已有71％修理完毕。常熟、铜山、邳县等地在检修药械中，以土代洋，用过水不涨的檀木加工为喷雾器的旋水塞，用墨水瓶盖做喷头盖，用旧套鞋剪成垫口代替牛皮垫口，用竹筒代替钢铁做唧水筒等，使检修工作又好又快，适应了防治病虫害的需要。
    各地病虫害的预测预报组织也有了发展。全省已建立预测预报站一百六十六个，公社情报点二千二百零七个，情报员五万七千余人，达到每县平均有两个站，每社有一至二个点，每个大队有二至三个情报员。给病虫布下天罗地网。
    新华社郑州27日电　河南偃师县在小麦普浇返青水，胜利渡过返青关的基础上，全面加强麦田管理，猛攻小麦拔节关。
    偃师县各公社今年对小麦返青期间的田间管理抓的早、抓的狠，各地麦苗普遍生长旺盛。现在春分已过，天气逐渐暖和，小麦普遍开始拔节，这是麦田中期管理的重要关口，管理得好，能使小麦多发头，长大穗，搞不好，不是变黄就是倒伏。为此各公社在春雨过后，都由书记挂帅，发动社员，掀起了以管好三类苗为中心的麦田管理高潮。各公社对三类麦一般每亩都施入人粪尿三十至六十担，力争高速度赶上一类麦。大口公社大口大队有四百六十亩黄瘦麦，采取“水肥混施法”，组织十二个专业队开沟条施，施后封盖，以保持充足的肥效，三类苗很快升了级。同时，对一、二类麦增施了磷钾肥，防止倒伏。老城公社东寺庄大队，对一类麦苗土壤含水量经常控制在18％—20％；每亩增施草木灰三百斤，过磷酸钙五百至一千斤，防止倒伏；根据去年喷洒磷肥增产的经验，对一类麦苗每亩用喷雾器喷洒二十斤磷肥。各公社还根据去年老城、翟镇等公社一些大队“培土防倒伏”的成功经验，结合中耕给麦苗培土。现在全县三十万亩丰产方，普遍培了老墙土，计每亩约一万斤左右。翟镇公社岳滩大队对一类苗计划培三次土，已培两次，每亩培土两万斤。通过上述各种措施和科学管理，全县小麦正在更加健壮地发育生长。
    偃师县还及早动手防治病虫害和霜冻等自然灾害。（附图片）
