    Superfluous Quibbling
    Chi Bei'ou Poem, Jiang Fan Painting
    An American spy is punished,
    The American government is ashamed and enraged,
    Spreading rumors, slandering, and protesting,
    Only because their conspiracy has been exposed.
    They say the criminal is truly innocent,
    Sincerely spreading the gospel for the Lord.
    Collecting intelligence is carrying out God's mission,
    Planning subversion is being loyal to the Holy Mother.
    China already has religious freedom,
    His activities should be protected.
    It's written clearly in the Bible:
    A wolf's face cannot be hidden by sheep's clothing.
    His religious cloak is torn off,
    He is a thorough and utter special agent.
    The criminal has already confessed everything,
    What's the use of all sorts of quibbling? (Attached image)

    多余的狡辩
    池北偶　诗　江帆　画
    美国间谍被惩处，
    美国政府羞成怒，
    造谣诽谤兼抗议，
    只因阴谋被揭露。
    据说罪犯实无辜，
    诚心传道为天主。
    搜集情报是执行上帝使命，
    策划颠覆是效忠圣母。
    中国既有宗教自由，
    他的活动就应受保护。
    圣经上写得清清楚楚：
    羊皮盖不住狼的面目。
    扯掉了他的宗教外衣，
    彻头彻尾一个大特务。
    犯罪的都已经供认不讳，
    各种狡辩还有什么用处？（附图片）
