Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 29th:  The magnificent labor emulation campaign launched by the Hungarian people to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their country's liberation (April 4th) has achieved remarkable results. Currently, the production enthusiasm of the urban and rural working people is unprecedented, and good news is constantly pouring in from all over the country.

    The vast number of workers fighting on the industrial front are full of energy. Many industrial enterprises have broken with past conventions and greatly increased production in the first quarter. The workers of the Lenin Iron and Steel United Works have completed their National Day dedication plan ten days ahead of schedule. In the first two and a half months of this year, they overfulfilled the plan by producing 5,000 tons of steel and other metallurgical products worth 12 million forints (Hungarian currency). The workers in the Dorog coal mining area have also completed their National Day dedication plan ahead of schedule, and the average daily output has increased by about 20% compared with last year.

    In order to welcome the 15th anniversary of National Day, a total of 39,000 labor teams in the national industrial and transportation sectors have formulated competition goals for increasing production and saving this year. The miners of the Komló coal mine decided to overproduce more than 30,000 tons of high-quality coal this year, saving 6 million forints. The workers of the Danube Iron and Steel Plant decided to produce 110,000 tons more iron and 100,000 tons more steel than last year, and to ensure that the hot rolling mill is put into production ahead of schedule. The Tótobánya Cement and Lime Factory proposed to overproduce 2,000 tons of cement.

    The movement for creation and technological innovation is also deepening and spreading. Enterprises affiliated to the metallurgical and machine-building industries have decided to save the country 810 million forints this year through technological innovation. The Budapest United Bulb Factory held an "Innovation Month" event to welcome National Day, and the workers put forward more than 100 innovative suggestions in the first ten days. The workers of the Csepel Automobile Factory used 300 hours of voluntary labor to design a set of automatic control units, which greatly reduced physical labor and improved production.

    In the process of the competition, the workers promoted the communist spirit and extensively carried out mutual assistance and cooperation movements. Construction enterprises, iron foundries, and machine factories in Nógrád County closely cooperated and supported each other, ensuring that a newly built glass factory in the state was put into production greatly ahead of schedule. Technicians from the Kőbánya Porcelain Factory worked together with workers to transform unusable old machine tools into new cutting machine tools. After this machine tool was put into production, the production of high-voltage porcelain insulators increased three times compared to the past, and the quality was also improved. The workers of the Csepel Factory and the Tótobánya coal mine also used voluntary labor to help accelerate the construction of new enterprises.

    The Hungarian farmers, who have embarked on the broad road of socialist collective management, are also greeting the upcoming National Day with unprecedented production enthusiasm. This year's spring plowing and sowing in Hungary is progressing particularly well, and tractor drivers are working in three shifts day and night to complete the plowing and sowing tasks in time. The newly established agricultural production cooperatives are challenging each other to rapidly develop animal husbandry, and have put forward the slogan of raising pigs in every household, raising poultry in every household, and providing more livestock products to the state.

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 28th: Our correspondent reports: Hungary is accelerating capital construction. This year, many important industrial projects across the country will be put into production or begin construction. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously update existing machinery and equipment, expand existing enterprises, and lay a good foundation for the second five-year plan (1961-1965).

    This year's total national investment is 16% higher than last year, and the funds used for capital construction amount to 33.4 billion forints, of which 78% is used for production purposes.

    This year's focus of Hungary's industrial capital investment is the power and metallurgical industries. This year, Hungary will put into production equipment with a total power generation capacity of 128,000 kilowatts. The Pécs, Ajka and Oroszlány power stations are currently under construction. The largest thermal power station in the country, the Danube Power Station, will also begin construction in April.

    The state will continue to invest 580 million forints this year to develop the Danube Iron and Steel Plant, so that the hot rolling mill of this plant will be put into production this year, and the construction of the cold rolling mill will be accelerated. The No. 4 open hearth furnace and the large bearing factory of the Danube Iron and Steel Plant will be completed this year.

    The building materials industry will also be greatly developed. After the expansion of the Lábatlan Cement Factory this year, it can provide the country with 87,000 tons of cement. The Danube Cement and Lime Factory, one of the largest capital construction projects during the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960), will also be completed this year.

    This year, Hungary used more than 2.2 billion forints to develop the chemical industry. The Borsod Fertilizer Factory will be put into production this year, and the Inota Aluminum Smelter will be expanded. In addition, some plastic and pharmaceutical factories will be expanded and newly built.

    Hungary's agricultural investment this year is 27% higher than last year, totaling 7 billion forints, half of which is used to develop agricultural mechanization. With the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, Hungarian agriculture will increase by 10,000 tractors, 4,000 seeders, 1,400 combine harvesters and 3,500 fertilizer spreaders this year.

    The characteristics of Hungary's capital construction this year are: first, in order to rapidly develop technology, the state has greatly increased the proportion of machine investment. The proportion of machine investment in the total investment has increased from 25%-28% in previous years to 41.5%. Second, strive to concentrate the use of funds and shorten the construction period. This year, the vast majority of capital construction investment is used to complete and continue key projects that have already started, and only a small portion of investment is used to build new enterprises. In this way, by the end of the year, 30% of the key projects that have already started construction will be completed. Third, do our best to expand existing factories and enterprises and improve their equipment, so as to achieve less investment and greater results, and make full use of existing production potential. Fourth, accelerate the development of industry outside the capital Budapest through investment, gradually relocate enterprises that are not suitable for development in Budapest to other places, so that they are close to power and raw material bases. This will help eliminate the phenomenon of excessive concentration of industry and population in the capital and promote the development of some economically less developed areas.

    劳动竞赛波澜壮阔　生产捷报不断传来
    匈牙利人民以出色成就向国庆献礼
    创造和技术革新运动日益深入和普及
    基本建设加快进度力求投资少收效大
    新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利人民为迎接祖国解放十五周年（4月4日）而展开的波澜壮阔的劳动竞赛，已经取得了辉煌的成绩。目前，城乡劳动人民的生产热情空前高涨，捷报正从全国各地不断传来。
    战斗在工业战线上的广大职工干劲十足。很多工业企业打破了往年的常规，在第一季度就大大提高了生产。列宁钢铁联合企业的职工们已提前十天完成了国庆献礼计划。他们在今年头两个半月内，共超计划增产了五千吨钢和价值一千二百万福林（匈币）的其他冶金产品。多罗哥煤区的职工们也提前完成了国庆献礼计划，目前平均日产量已比去年提高了20％左右。
    为了迎接国庆十五周年，全国工业和交通部门共有三万九千个劳动队制定了今年增产节约的竞赛目标。柯姆洛煤矿的矿工决定今年要超计划增产三万多吨优质煤，节约六百万福林的资金。多瑙钢铁厂的职工决定今年要比去年增产十一万吨铁和十万吨钢，并保证热轧钢厂提前投入生产。托托巴尼奥水泥和石灰工厂提出要超计划多生产二千吨水泥。
    创造和技术革新运动也正在日益深入和普及。冶金和机器制造工业部门所属的企业决定在今年内通过技术革新为国家节约价值八亿一千万福林的资金。布达佩斯联合灯泡厂为迎接国庆举行了“革新月”的活动，职工们在头十天内就提出了一百多项革新建议。切佩尔汽车厂的职工们用三百小时的义务劳动设计了一套自动控制机组，大大减轻了体力劳动，并提高了生产。
    在竞赛过程中，职工们发扬了共产主义的风格，广泛开展了互助协作运动。诺格拉德州的建筑企业、铸铁厂和机器厂密切合作，互相支援，保证了这个州的一个新建玻璃厂大大提前投入生产。克巴尼亚瓷器厂的技术员同工人共同合作，把不能用的旧机床改造成新型的切削机床。这种机床投入生产后，使高电压的瓷器绝缘体的生产比过去提高了三倍，同时也改进了质量。切佩尔工厂和托托巴尼奥煤矿的职工们并且以义务劳动来帮助加速新企业的建设。
    走上社会主义集体经营的康庄大道的匈牙利农民，也以空前的生产热情迎接即将到来的国庆。匈牙利今年的春耕春播工作进行得特别好，拖拉机手们为了及时完成耕种任务，日夜三班轮流工作。新成立的农业生产合作社互相挑战，要迅速地发展畜牧业，并提出家家养猪、户户养家禽、向国家提供更多的畜产品的口号。
    新华社布达佩斯28日电　本社记者报道：匈牙利正在加速进行基本建设。今年，全国将有很多重要工业项目投入生产或开始兴建，同时还要大力更新现有的机器和设备，扩建原有企业，为第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）打下良好的基础。
    今年国家的投资总额比去年提高16％，用于基本建设的资金达三百三十四亿福林。其中78％用于生产目的。
    今年匈牙利工业基本投资的重点是电力和冶金工业。在今年内，匈牙利将有发电能力共达十二万八千瓩的设备投入生产。现在正在进行建设的有：佩奇、阿以卡和奥罗斯拉尼等发电站。全国最大的火力发电站多瑙发电站也将于4月间开始动工。
    国家今年继续投资五亿八千万福林来发展多瑙钢铁厂，使这个工厂的热轧钢厂今年投入生产，并加速冷轧钢厂的建设。多瑙钢铁厂的四号平炉和大型轴承厂将在今年建成。
    建筑器材工业也将得到很大的发展。拉巴特兰水泥厂在今年扩建后，可以提供国家八万七千吨水泥。属于三年计划（1958—1960年）期间最大的基本建设工程之一的多瑙水泥和石灰厂，也将在今年建成。
    今年，匈牙利用于发展化学工业的资金达二十二亿多福林。包尔绍德化肥厂今年将投入生产，伊诺塔炼铝厂将进行扩建；此外还要扩建和新建一些塑料和制药厂。
    匈牙利今年的农业投资比去年提高27％，总额达七十亿福林。其中一半用于发展农业机械化。随着农业合作化运动的发展，今年匈牙利农业将增加一万台拖拉机、四千台播种机、一千四百台联合收割机和三千五百台施肥机。
    匈牙利今年基本建设的特色是：第一，为了迅速发展技术、国家大大增加了机器投资的比重。机器投资在投资总额中所占的比重已由前几年的25％—28％提高到41．5％。第二，力求集中使用资金，缩短施工期限。今年绝大部分的基本建设投资用于结束和继续进行已开工的重点工程，只有很少一部分投资用来兴建新企业。这样到年底时，30％的已动工兴建的重点工程建设将可以完工。第三，尽力扩建现有工厂企业，改善其设备，以便做到投资少而收效大，充分利用现有的生产潜力。第四，通过投资来加速首都布达佩斯以外地区的工业的发展，逐渐把一些不适合在布达佩斯发展的企业迁移到外地去，使之接近动力和原料基地。这将有助于消除首都工业和人口过于集中的现象，促进一些经济发展较慢的地区的发展。
