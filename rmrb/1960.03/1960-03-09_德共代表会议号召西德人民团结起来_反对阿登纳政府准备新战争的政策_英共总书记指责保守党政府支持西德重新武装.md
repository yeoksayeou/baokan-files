Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party announced through the "German Freedom Radio 904" that the German Communist Party held a congress in the Cologne region of West Germany in early February. The meeting unanimously adopted a document entitled "The Situation in the (German) Federal Republic, the Struggle for Peace, Democracy and Social Welfare" and an appeal. The Congress called on West German residents to unite broadly against the Adenauer government's policy of launching a new war, demanding an immediate halt to the arms race, the abandonment of atomic weapons, negotiations with the German Democratic Republic to conclude a non-aggression treaty, the conclusion of a peace treaty, the establishment of an All-German Committee to prepare for reunification, and the establishment of a parliamentary democratic order in West Germany.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, delivered a report at the Congress. He emphasized that the leading organs and grassroots organizations of the German Communist Party are carrying out the tasks of strengthening the Party organizationally and ideologically, striving to restore the Party's legal status, striving for unified action by the working class, and carrying out mass movements against West German militarism and its war plans.

The appeal of the Congress pointed out that the Federal Republic of Germany has become a major source of war danger in Europe. It would be fatal to ignore Adenauer's war policy.

The appeal called on workers, peasants and other citizens to unite in the common struggle to defeat the militarists.

The appeal pointed out that now is the time for the people to rise up and take an interest in establishing normal relations between the two Germanys. The appeal said that if it were not for the existence of the German Democratic Republic, the militarists would have launched their planned eastward advance long ago. The German Democratic Republic is a strong peace fortress that saves the German nation from the disaster of a new war, and West Germans fighting for democracy and social stability can always rely on the German Democratic Republic.

The appeal emphasized that in order to successfully wage the struggle for peace, the German Communist Party needs to be legalized. Without the legalization of the German Communist Party, there would be no democracy and German reunification could not be restored.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th: British public opinion has expressed anger at a statement made by the US Ambassador to Bonn, Dowling, on the 3rd, in which Dowling openly stated that the United States does not object to West Germany establishing military bases in Britain.

Dowling said at a press conference in Bonn: "It is certainly necessary for [West Germany] to seek rear bases abroad." He also said: "As far as we [the United States] are concerned, it does not matter whether these bases are established in France, Spain, Portugal, Britain, or the Netherlands and Belgium." On the same day, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office also confirmed that the question of West Germany's request to establish military bases abroad "has been repeatedly raised within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and many possibilities have been discussed."

The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, John Gollan, issued a statement today on Dowling's speech, saying: "Hitler's army never landed here (Britain) except as prisoners. But Adenauer's generals are negotiating within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to station the 'Bundeswehr' on British territory. Could German (West German) arrogance and Conservative treachery go any further than this? Is this what the British people fought and sacrificed for in the anti-fascist war? This is the result of rearming West Germany."

He called on the British people to rise up and fight, "to tell the government, 'No arms for Adenauer.'" A commentary in the British "Daily Worker" said: "Former Hitler generals dare to demand the establishment of military bases for West German armed forces in Britain - bases for organizing their planned war against the Soviet Union. But worse, the US and British governments are calmly discussing these demands."

    德共代表会议号召西德人民团结起来
    反对阿登纳政府准备新战争的政策
    英共总书记指责保守党政府支持西德重新武装
    据新华社柏林电　德国共产党中央委员会政治局通过“德国九○四自由广播电台”宣布，德国共产党2月上旬在西德科隆地区举行了代表会议。会议一致通过了一个题为“（德意志）联邦共和国局势，争取和平、民主和社会福利的斗争”的文件和一份呼吁书。代表会议号召西德居民广泛团结起来，反对阿登纳政府发动新战争的政策，要求立即停止扩充军备、摒弃原子武器，要求同德意志民主共和国谈判缔结互不侵犯条约、缔结对德和约、成立全德委员会为重新统一作准备以及在西德建立议会民主秩序等。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼在代表会议上作了报告。他着重指出，德国共产党的领导机关和基层组织正在执行有关从组织上和思想上加强党、争取恢复党的合法地位、争取工人阶级统一行动以及开展群众运动反对西德军国主义及其战争计划的各项任务。
    代表会议的呼吁书指出，德意志联邦共和国已变成欧洲战争危险的主要策源地。如果无视阿登纳的战争政策，那将是致命的。
    呼吁书号召工人、农民和其他市民必须在击败军国主义者的共同斗争中团结起来。
    呼吁书指出，现在正是人民起来过问两个德国建立正常关系的时候了。呼吁书说，要不是德意志民主共和国的存在，军国主义者早就发起了它们策划的东进。德意志民主共和国是使德国民族免遭新战争灾难的坚强的和平堡垒，为民主及社会安定而斗争的西德人永远可以倚靠德意志民主共和国。
    呼吁书着重指出，为了成功地进行争取和平的斗争，需要德国共产党合法化。德国共产党不合法化就没有民主，就不能恢复德国统一。
  据新华社伦敦4日电　英国舆论对美国驻波恩大使陶林3日发表的一番谈话表示愤怒，陶林公开表示，美国并不反对西德在英国建立军事基地。
    陶林在波恩举行的一次记者招待会上说：“肯定地说，（西德）在国外寻求后方基地是必要的。”他还说：“就我们（美国）自己来说，这些基地无论是建立在法国、西班牙、葡萄牙、英国或荷兰和比利时都没有什么关系。”同一天，英国外交部发言人也证实，关于西德要求在国外建立军事基地的问题，“已经在北大西洋集团内一再提出，而且已经讨论了许多种可能性”。
    英国共产党总书记高兰今天就陶林的讲话发表声明说：“希特勒的军队除了作为俘虏以外，从来没有在这里（英国）登陆过。但是阿登纳的将领们却在北大西洋集团中进行谈判，要在英国领土上驻扎‘国防军’了。德国（西德）人的骄横和保守党的卖国难道还能比这个更进一步吗？难道这就是英国人在反法西斯战争中为之而战斗和牺牲的东西吗？这就是重新武装西德的结果。”
    他号召英国人民起来斗争，“告诉政府，不给阿登纳武装。”英国“工人日报”的一篇评论说：“前希特勒将领们竟然敢于要求在英国建立西德武装部队的军事基地——组织他们所计划的反苏战争的基地。但是，更糟的是，美国和英国政府正在平静地讨论着这些要求。”
