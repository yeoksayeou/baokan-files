    Words of People on a Boat
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai
    Yachts going east and west,
    Tropical havens to escape the cold.
    Conversations of bosses on the boat,
    Sound truly amusing.
   "John, have you been pleased lately?"
   "Indeed, I've been extraordinarily busy, Willie,
    I've newly been appointed as a director of twelve companies,
    Each only grants me a month's vacation!"
    This is called: "Capitalists are also laborers,
    Capitalism is growing into socialism!"
    This is called: An international new fraud,
    Revisionist old trick.

    "I am the director of twelve companies, each giving me a month's vacation."

    艇上人语
    袁水拍配诗
    游艇到东到西，
    热带避寒胜地。
    艇上老板对话，
    听来实在逗趣。
   “约翰，最近你可得意？”
   “真是忙得出奇，威利，
    我新任十二家公司董事，
    每家只给一个月假期！”
    这叫做：“资本家也是劳动者，
    资本主义长入了社会主义！”
    这叫做：国际新骗局，
    修正主义旧把戏。

    “我是十二家公司的董事，每家给一个月假期”。
