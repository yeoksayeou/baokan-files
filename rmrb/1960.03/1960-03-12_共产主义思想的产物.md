On the basis of promoting the simplified, boosted-voltage, ring power supply experience, the Harbin Electric Wire Factory, through cooperation with various factories, enterprises, organizations, schools, and street residents outside the factory, completely broke the boundaries of the "self-reliance" of each power-consuming unit in the past. It achieved the cooperative use of electricity by 39 large and small enterprises and more than 1,500 organizations, schools, and residents within a 910,000-square-meter area in the Nanma Road area. This is a major technical reform in the urban power supply mode and a product of communist thought during the Great Leap Forward. It demonstrates a new way to fully utilize the superiority of the socialist system, tap the potential of social production, and promote the sustained leap forward of the national economy.

What is urban cooperative power supply (i.e., "four-in-one" ring power supply)? Some people compare it to developing from separate "small pots" to running "public canteens." This comparison is apt. It not only vividly depicts the cooperative urban power supply mode, but also reflects the essence of this reform. The original urban power supply systems in our country generally adopted two methods: "dedicated" and "public." That is, some factories, enterprises, organizations, and other units with high power consumption all had their own set of power distribution and transformation equipment. Other smaller factories, enterprises, and organizations, schools, and residents with lower power consumption had another set of public power distribution and transformation systems. In a region, after the regional substation sent out electricity, each power-consuming unit had another set of power distribution and transformation equipment to distribute the power to various parts of the unit, such as to various workshops in a factory. Each workshop adopted a dedicated circuit for power supply, with no connection to each other, and even the voltage was different. This power supply method, in which each factory has a set of distribution and transformation equipment, is generally larger than the actual power consumption capacity. This has created a situation where regional substations are fully loaded or overloaded, while some factories have surplus equipment, while others lack it, making it impossible to fully start the machines or to operate them normally even when they are started. Within a factory, due to unconnected circuits and different voltages, if workshop A lacks electricity, workshop B cannot provide support even if it has electricity. With the increasing development of socialist construction, although the power industry department has made many improvements to the original power supply system, because it has not completely broken the decentralized power consumption method of "self-reliance," this method is becoming increasingly incompatible with the high-speed development of productivity. It is not only unreasonable and uneconomical, but also hinders the development of production. This was the case in the Nanma Road area of Daoli District in Harbin City before the reform. On the one hand, each enterprise unit had dedicated power distribution and transformation equipment with a total capacity of 11,700 kVA, while the total maximum load of actual power consumption of each unit was only 6,700 kVA, accounting for only about 57% of the total capacity. This means that nearly half of the electricity was actually wasted. On the other hand, all regional substations were overloaded and could not increase power supply capacity. Therefore, the first and second tool factories and the flour mill in the Nanma Road area were short of 4,500 kW of electricity, and the two automated production lines that had been built could not be put into production. The hindrance of this outdated power supply method to the development of production is obvious.

After the implementation of cooperative power supply in the Nanma Road area of Harbin City, this unreasonable and uneconomical power supply method was changed, and the boundaries of "each household" and "small stove" were completely broken. The factory's internal lighting and power consumption, the power consumption between factories, the power consumption between industry and residents, and the factory power grid were combined. That is, the four aspects of power consumption were combined with the regional power grid, and the decentralized and ununified power supply method was changed into a centralized and unified power supply method. This enabled the discovery of 4,500 kW of power supply equipment, providing the necessary electricity for the continued leap forward in production. The actual results in the Nanma Road area of Harbin City and other regions across the country that have promoted this experience prove that cooperative power supply not only strengthens mutual assistance and cooperation among units, improves voltage, and makes power supply safer, but also reduces power loss, saves transformation equipment and electrical materials, thereby promoting the development of production. It is foreseeable that after the widespread promotion of cooperative power supply experience across the country, the current shortage of transformer equipment will be significantly changed, greatly accelerating the development of the power industry. At the same time, it will also promote the great improvement of the power system and power consumption management work, which can improve power supply capacity, simplify management work, and reduce management personnel.

The experience of urban cooperative power supply has found a new path for the reform of China's original power supply system, and also pointed out a new direction for the future construction of a new and more reasonable power supply system. However, the significance of cooperative power supply is by no means limited to this. This is by no means a simple technical issue of the layout and design of the power supply system, but has very important significance. The experience of cooperative power supply shows that in socialist construction, it is necessary to fully utilize the superiority of the socialist system, fully promote communist thought, and constantly promote the leap forward of production. Breaking the boundaries of decentralized power supply in the past, concentrating scattered electrical equipment for common use, and implementing unified and cooperative centralized power supply within a large area can only be achieved in a socialist society with public ownership of the means of production and planned production. In a capitalist society with private ownership of the means of production and anarchic production, it is fundamentally impossible to achieve this. Under the socialist system, the interests of all units of the national economy are consistent, and they are all working towards a common goal: developing socialist production and prospering the socialist economy. The basis of their mutual relations is comradely mutual assistance and cooperation. Socialist construction requires the development of the widest possible cooperation between all departments and units of the national economy. Social production is originally a whole, and the relationship between the various departments of the national economy is originally inseparable. Industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry have an inseparable connection. The mining industry, the smelting industry, the fuel and power industry, and the machinery industry also have an inseparable connection. Production and transportation, production and circulation, and production and consumption are equally inseparable. Schools and scientific research are also part of social production in a broad sense. The various divisions of labor in society are the various links in the entire process of social production. The division of labor of the various departments of the national economy itself is conditional upon cooperation with each other. This is the dialectical relationship between division of labor and cooperation. Our economic workers, no matter which aspect of work they are responsible for, must recognize the relationship between division of labor and cooperation, and must carry forward the communist spirit of cooperation, so that their subjective world conforms to the objective world and conforms to the objective laws that the various departments of the national economy must fully cooperate. The emergence of the urban cooperative power supply method reflects the understanding of the laws of division of labor and cooperation in the various departments of the national economy, and reflects the promotion of the communist spirit of cooperation.

Under the socialist system, production is social, and the ownership of the means of production is socialist. This mode of production requires a series of production management methods that are adapted to it in the production process. The cooperative power supply method was created on this basis. Before this, the reason why the old decentralized power supply method could continue to be used and had not been changed was not only due to some technical reasons, but also reflected that people's minds had not been liberated and were still bound by some old ideas, and liked to follow in the footsteps of others. For example, some power-consuming units were afraid that changing the power supply system would disrupt the original power distribution network; they were afraid that after the reform, they would not have their own dedicated equipment or lines, and it would be inconvenient to use electricity; some power industry units were afraid of disrupting various power supply systems, charging systems, and investment systems, and the work would be difficult to handle, and so on. These considerations all started from local interests. As a result, the old power supply method was regarded as something that could not be changed, and they did not consider what kind of social system this power supply method was produced under, what kind of production method characteristics it reflected; at the same time, they did not study whether the old power supply method was still adapted to the characteristics of the new socialist production method. The issue of power supply methods, like other production management issues, is a technical issue, but also a political issue. From a technical point of view, any technology is used to serve a certain class, so how to use it is inevitably marked with a class imprint. The industrial layout, process regulations, designs, etc. of capitalism must reflect the characteristics of capitalist production relations. Therefore, many industrial layouts, process regulations, and various production management methods, etc., which seem to be the most reasonable and scientific in capitalist society, are not only not truly reasonable and scientific for us, but some are even extremely unreasonable and unscientific. Therefore, breaking the shackles of outdated ideas and adapting production management methods to the socialist mode of production in order to promote the development of social productive forces is a major task for our economic workers. The emergence of the cooperative power supply method is a vivid example of how to make production management methods suitable for the socialist mode of production.

It can be seen from this that the cooperative power supply experience is by no means just a simple technical experience of reforming the power supply system, but also an experience of how to fully utilize and exert the superiority of the socialist system, and an experience of promoting the communist spirit of cooperation. Recently, the Harbin Bearing Factory's employees learned from this experience in water supply problems, and carried out large-scale cooperation with factories, enterprises, organizations, schools, and residents near the factory to achieve cooperative "four-in-one" ring water supply, improving water supply capacity, which is not only conducive to production and life, but also conducive to fire protection work. This fact once again illustrates that this experience has a broad and profound significance. In fact, since the Great Leap Forward, the various economic departments, starting from comradely cooperation and mutual assistance and a common upsurge of communist viewpoints, have found many methods that can effectively promote the development of production with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. For example, industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, and other departments have implemented large-scale one-stop cooperation in transportation work; various industries and trades have carried out large-scale cooperation in the use of technical forces and the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and so on. All of these have shown the new upsurge of communist thought among the vast number of cadres and people in our country. Fully exerting the ideological power of this communism is the most important condition for our country's continued leap forward.

    共产主义思想的产物
    哈尔滨市电线厂在推行简化、升压、环形供电经验的基础上，通过与厂外各工厂、企业、机关、学校和街道居民的协作，彻底打破了历来各用电单位“自立门户”的界限，实现了南马路地区九十一万平方米范围内，三十九个大小企业、一千五百多户机关、学校、居民的供用电合作化。这是城市供用电方式的一项重大技术改革，是大跃进中共产主义思想的产物。它展示了充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，挖掘社会生产潜力，促进国民经济持续跃进的新途径。
    什么叫做城市合作化供用电（即“四合一”环形供电）？有人把它比做由分门别户的“小锅饭”，发展到办“公共食堂”。这个比方是贴切的，它不仅形象地描绘了合作化的城市供用电的方式，也反映了这个改革的实质。我国原来的城市供电系统，普遍是采用“专用”和“公用”两种方式。这就是一些用电较多的工厂、企业、机关等单位，都有自己的一套配电和变电设备；另一些较小的工厂、企业及用电较少的机关、学校、居民又另是一套公用配电和变电系统。在一个地区内，地区变电所送出电去以后，各用电单位另有一套配电和变电设备，把电源分送到这个单位的各个部分去，例如在工厂就是分送到各个车间去，而各个车间又是采取专用电路供电，彼此互不联系，甚至电压也不相同。这种各厂都有一套配变电设备的供用电方式，一般都比实际用电的容量大。这就造成了这样一种情况：地区变电所满负荷、超负荷，而各厂呢，有的设备有富裕，有的却缺少，不能开足机器或是机器开动了而不能正常运转；在一个厂内，也由于电路不联系，电压不相同，甲车间缺电，乙车间有电也不能支援。随着社会主义建设的日益发展，电业部门虽然对原有的供用电系统也作了不少的改善，但是由于没有彻底打破这种“自立门户”的分散用电方式，这种方式与生产力的高速度发展不相适应就越来越明显。它不仅不合理、不经济，而且妨碍着生产的发展。改革前的哈尔滨市道里区南马路就是如此。一方面是各企业单位都有专用的配电和变电设备，总容量达到一万一千七百千伏安，而各单位的实际用电最大负荷总共只有六千七百千伏安，只占到总容量的57％左右，这就是说，实际上浪费了将近一半的电力。但是，另一方面，地区变电所全部超负荷，不能再增加供电能力，因而南马路地区第一、第二工具厂和面粉厂等共缺电四千五百瓩，已经建成了的两条自动生产线也不能投入生产。这种陈旧的供电方式之妨碍生产的发展是显而易见的。
    哈尔滨市南马路地区实行合作化供用电以后，就改变了这种不合理、不经济的供用电方式，彻底打破“一家一户”各开“小锅小灶”的界限，把工厂内部照明与动力用电、工厂与工厂之间的用电、工业与居民之间的用电、厂用电网，也就是说，把四方面的用电与地区电网合而为一，把分散的、不统一的供用电方式，改变成为集中的、统一的供用电方式，从而挖掘出四千五百瓩的供电设备，为生产继续跃进提供了必需的电能。哈尔滨市南马路和全国其它已经推广了这一经验的地区的实际效果证明：合作化供用电不仅密切了各单位的互助协作，提高了电压，使供用电更加安全，还减少了电力损耗，节约了变电设备和电气器材，从而促进了生产的发展。可以预料，合作化供用电经验在全国普遍推广以后，将使目前缺少变压设备的情况发生显著改变，大大加速电力工业的发展。同时，它还将促进电业系统及用电管理工作的大大改善，既可以提高供电能力，简化管理工作，还可减少管理人员。
    城市合作化供用电的经验，给我国原有供用电系统的改革，找到了一条新的途径，也为今后建设新的更合理的供用电系统指出了一个新的方向。但是，合作化供用电的意义绝不仅止于此，这绝不是一个单纯的供用电系统的布置、设计的技术问题，它有非常重大的意义。合作化供用电的经验表明：在社会主义建设中，必须充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，充分发扬共产主义思想，不断促进生产的跃进。打破过去一家一户分散供电的界限，把分散的电气设备集中起来，共同使用，实行大面积内统一的、合作化的集中供电，只有在生产资料公有制的有计划生产的社会主义社会中才能实现。在生产资料私有制的生产无政府状态的资本主义社会里，要作到这点是根本不可能的。在社会主义制度下，国民经济各单位之间的利益是一致的，他们都是为着一个共同的目标——发展社会主义生产，繁荣社会主义经济。他们相互关系的基础，是同志式的互助合作。而社会主义建设又要求国民经济各部门、各单位之间发展尽可能广泛的协作。社会生产本来是一个整体，国民经济各部门之间的关系本来是密切不可分的。工业和农业、重工业和轻工业有着不可分割的联系，采掘工业、冶炼工业、燃料动力工业和机械工业也有着不可分割的联系，生产和运输、生产和流通、生产和消费也同样是不可分割的。学校和科学研究在广义上说也是社会生产的一部分。社会的各项分工是社会生产整个过程中的各个环节。国民经济各部门的分工本身是以彼此之间的协作为条件的。这就是分工和协作的辩证关系。我们的经济工作人员，不管他是分工负责哪一方面的工作，都必须认识分工和协作的关系，都必须发扬共产主义的协作精神，使自己的主观世界符合于客观世界，符合于国民经济各部门必须充分协作的客观规律。城市合作化供用电方式的产生正是反映了对国民经济各部门的分工和协作的规律的认识，反映了共产主义协作精神的发扬。
    在社会主义制度下，生产是社会性的，生产资料所有制是社会主义性质的，这种生产方式要求在生产过程中有一系列的与之相适应的生产管理方式。合作化供用电方式就是在这样的基础上产生的。在这以前，旧的分散的供用电方式之所以能沿用下来一直没有改变，固然有着技术上的一些原因，但也反映了过去人们的思想没有解放，还受着一些旧观念的束缚，喜欢踩着别人的脚印走路。比如有的用电单位怕改变了供用电系统把原来的配电网打乱了；怕改革以后没有了自己的专用设备或线路，使用电力不方便；有的电业单位又怕打乱了各项供用电制度、收费及投资制度，工作不好办等等。这些考虑都是从局部利益出发的，结果是把旧有的供用电方式看成了不可变更的东西，没有考虑这种供电方式是在什么社会制度下产生的，它反映的是什么样的生产方式的特征；同时也没有从新的社会主义生产方式的特点来研究旧有的供用电方式是否还相适应。供用电的方式问题，同其他生产管理问题一样，是技术问题，也是政治问题。从技术上看，任何技术都被利用来为一定的阶级服务，因而如何利用它，是必不可免地要带有阶级的烙印的。资本主义的工业布局、工艺规程、设计等等，都必然要反映出资本主义生产关系的特点。因此，许多在资本主义社会看来是最合理、最科学的工业布局、工艺规程以及各种生产管理方式等等，对我们说来不仅不是真正合理、科学的，有的甚至是极不合理、极不科学的。因此破除陈旧观念的束缚，使生产管理方式适应于社会主义的生产方式，以促进社会生产力的发展，是我们经济工作人员的重大任务。合作化供用电方式的产生就是如何使生产管理方式适合于社会主义的生产方式的一个生动的例子。
    由此可见，合作化供用电经验，绝不只是一个单纯的改革供用电系统的技术经验，而且是一条如何充分利用和发挥社会主义制度的优越性的经验，是一条大兴共产主义协作之风的经验。最近，哈尔滨市轴承厂职工在供用水问题上学习了这一经验，与本厂附近的工厂、企业、机关、学校和居民大搞协作，实现了合作化的“四合一”环形供水，提高了供水能力，既有利于生产、生活，也有利于消防工作。这个事实再一次地说明了这个经验具有广泛而深刻的意义。事实上，大跃进以来，各经济部门从同志式的协作互助、共同高涨的共产主义观点出发，找到了许多有力地促进生产又多又快又好又省的发展的方法。例如工、农、商、交通等部门在运输工作上实行一条龙的大协作；各行各业在技术力量的使用和原材料的综合利用上的大协作等等，都显示了我国广大干部和人民群众中共产主义思想的新高涨。充分发挥这种共产主义的思想威力，是我国继续跃进的最重要的条件。
