Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, China's entire national economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the cause of culture and art is also flourishing rapidly. As early as 1949, Chairman Mao predicted: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Practice has proved that Chairman Mao's scientific prediction is entirely correct.

The cultural and artistic work in the Baoding area, like that in other parts of the country, has made great progress in the past decade or so under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, in order to meet the needs of economic development and satisfy the growing material and cultural demands of the broad masses, Party committees at all levels, in the spirit of grasping politics with one hand, production with the other, and also doing a good job in the people's lives, have further strengthened their leadership over cultural and artistic work. In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee on actively cultivating and developing local opera genres, the Baoding Prefectural Party Committee has carried out work to cultivate, improve, and develop the "Old Tune" opera genre, which has unique characteristics and is loved by the broad masses of the people.

"Old Tune" is one of the major opera genres in the Baoding area, and it is said to have originated in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. It has more than one hundred traditional plays and more than two hundred musical tunes, with simple and melodious singing and a unique folk art style, deeply loved by the broad masses of working people. However, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders, it was not only not developed or improved, but suffered extremely great devastation. The broad masses of artists were subjected to humiliation and trampling, with no political security and living in desperation. Many artists abandoned their art and returned to farming, while others were displaced and died without burial. Before liberation, this opera genre was on its last breath, almost extinct. After liberation, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and the Party's literary and art policies, and through the vigorous cultivation of the Party and the government, the Old Tune opera genre was able to revive and grow, prosper, and become strong.

In order to quickly restore, inherit, and develop the Old Tune opera genre, the Baoding Prefectural Party Committee expanded the Gaoyang County Old Tune Opera Troupe into a special district Old Tune Opera Troupe in 1959, as an experimental field for the Prefectural Party Committee to thoroughly implement the Party's literary and art policies and cultivate local opera genres, and used this as a key point to drive and guide the development of the entire opera cause in the district. Over the past two years, with the care and vigorous support of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and relying on the active efforts of the broad masses of actors and artists, the Old Tune Opera Troupe has grown and become stronger. Now, the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of actors and artists has been unprecedentedly improved, and they are full of energy, so their artistic level has also been greatly improved. In the past two years, not only have many traditional plays been rescued, restored, and reorganized, but a large number of modern dramas serving politics, production, and workers, peasants, and soldiers have been rehearsed, enriching the people's lives and promoting the development of production, and coordinating with the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front; moreover, under the guidance of the policy of walking on two legs of popularization and improvement, excellent plays with higher ideological and artistic levels such as "Pan Yang Lawsuit," "Well Platform Meeting," and "Interrogation of the Wife" have been rehearsed with leaps and bounds. These initial achievements are a victory for Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and the result of implementing the Party's General Line and literary and art policies.

The main measures we have taken in the work of reviving the Old Tune opera genre are:

First, strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to the principle of putting politics in command.

With the in-depth development of the socialist revolution and construction, we have deeply realized from practice that in the new historical stage, cultural and artistic work plays a very important role in promoting production and coordinating the transformation of the superstructure. Therefore, in addition to including the entire cultural and artistic work in the Party's agenda, the Prefectural Party Committee, in the spirit of creating models, establishing benchmarks, moving from point to surface, summarizing experience, and providing comprehensive guidance, strengthened the specific leadership of the special district Old Tune Opera Troupe after transferring the Gaoyang Old Tune Opera Troupe to the special district troupe in 1959. First of all, we strengthened ideological leadership. In addition to providing strong support in terms of financial and material resources, and transferring a group of capable cadres to enrich the leadership core of the Old Tune Opera Troupe and strengthen political and ideological leadership, the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Prefectural Party Committee, the Minister of Propaganda, and other principal responsible cadres also often went deep into the troupe to personally listen to the troupe's reports and check the troupe's rehearsal and performance situation; at the same time, in view of the main tendencies and problems existing in the political ideology of the actors and other opera workers in each period, they were given timely guidance and education. Comrade Song Lian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Prefectural Party Committee, also specifically guided the rehearsal work. Secondly, the troupe, according to the instructions of the Prefectural Party Committee, adhered to the principle of putting politics first and achieving overall leaps in politics, culture, and art. Under the Party's meticulous cultivation, care, and education, the broad masses of actors have grown rapidly. Young actors such as Wang Guanying, Chen Shuhuan, Zhou Shuqin, Bai Yuchang, and Xin Qiuhua gloriously joined the Communist Party of China due to the improvement of their awareness. At the same time, due to the improvement of their political awareness, they strictly demanded themselves and worked hard to study, so their cultural and artistic levels also rapidly improved, setting an example for all the actors to leap forward along the road of being both red and expert.

Second, adhere to the mass line and launch mass movements on a large scale. This is one of the most fundamental experiences in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction cause, and it is also the fundamental experience for the high-speed development of cultural and artistic work. In order to master and apply this experience in the troupe, we adopted the method of pooling wisdom and efforts in the Old Tune Opera Troupe from writing to performing. In terms of writing and organizing scripts, we overcame the past practice of a few people closing their doors and engaging in creation in a cold and deserted manner, but instead adopted the work of leading cadres, directors, actors, musicians, and art workers participating in writing, organizing, and revising scripts. For example, scripts such as "Pan Yang Lawsuit," "Interrogation of the Wife," and "Well Platform Meeting" were collectively organized by dozens of people talking and working. In terms of rehearsal, a mass campaign of offering suggestions and plans was launched. For each new play being rehearsed, the Party organization called on the broad masses of actors and staff to offer ideas, think of ways, offer physical skills, and offer singing styles, and emphasized that the actors should go deep into reality and experience life, which improved the speed and quality of rehearsing plays. At the same time, in combination with performances, the troupe also widely solicited the opinions of the audience. The play "Pan Yang Lawsuit" alone invited representatives of the audience for five forums and put forward nearly five hundred valuable opinions, making up for many shortcomings that the director and actors could not have thought of. Practice has proved that adhering to the mass line and launching mass movements on a large scale in opera work can not only rapidly improve artistic levels, but more importantly, only in this way can the ideology of literary and art workers be rapidly transformed and a work style of believing in and relying on the masses be established. Therefore, the process of adhering to the mass line and launching mass movements on a large scale is essentially also the process of improving and transforming the ideology of literary and art workers.

Third, emphasize that opera art should go deep into reality and deep into life, expand the actors' horizons, improve their understanding, transform their ideology, and enhance the ideological and artistic nature of opera art from actual struggles. In 1959, the special district Old Tune Opera Troupe performed more than 420 performances, of which performances going up the mountains and down to the countryside to go deep into reality accounted for 80% of the performances. The heroes of reservoirs such as Wangkuai and Xidayang and some factories and mines saw a significant increase in their revolutionary enthusiasm and work efficiency every time they saw a performance; at the same time, the achievements of high-speed leaps forward on various fronts greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of actors in diligently studying and practicing and the great improvement of their political awareness. Now, the Old Tune opera genre has established a deep revolutionary friendship with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and its ideological roots have been deeply rooted among the working people. Therefore, the broad masses love and care for the growth and strength of this new force like loving mothers. Practice has proved that only by going deep into reality, deep into the masses, and participating in actual struggles can we correctly and deeply implement the literary and art policy of serving politics, serving socialist construction, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and fully play the role of literary and art work in promoting production and transforming the superstructure and ideology in a subtle way; only in this way can the broad masses of literary and art workers be trained, transformed, and improved in terms of ideological and artistic levels in actual struggles.

Fourth, adhere to the policy of walking on two legs. In accordance with Chairman Mao's opera policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," we have both inherited the excellent traditions of the Old Tune opera genre and boldly innovated by breaking through tradition, and strived to absorb the achievements of brother opera genres. Because society is advancing, and the people's cultural level and artistic appreciation ability are constantly improving, any art that is complacent and stagnant will be divorced from the masses and eliminated by the times, which is actually stifling the heritage. In our work of reviving the Old Tune opera genre, we first organized forces to excavate and copy traditional Old Tune plays and musical tunes based on the memories and oral accounts of famous old artists, and then, after sorting and processing, innovated on the basis of inheriting traditions. For example, in the "Pan Yang Lawsuit," the scene of "Tuning the Kou" inherited the melodious and beautiful singing and artistic performance programs of the Old Tune opera genre, removed the slavish appearance of Kou Zhun portrayed by the ruling class, and highlighted Kou Zhun's just and loyal, intelligent and broad-minded personality, making him stand up in the hearts of the audience. In addition, in order to enrich the art of the Old Tune opera genre, we also learned from the excellent plays of brother opera genres, such as learning "Blocking the Horse" from the Hebei Provincial Youth Leap Forward Bangzi Opera Troupe; at the same time, we also broke down superstitions and rehearsed more than 20 modern plays welcomed by the audience, such as "Mother and Daughter." Under the encouragement of the Party, since 1954, the Old Tune opera genre has had female actors for the first time. At present, many female actors play the leading roles, completely changing the situation in the history of the Old Tune opera genre where men played women's roles, and prospering this opera genre.

Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, although we have achieved some results in the work of rescuing, restoring, and developing the Old Tune opera genre, it is still far from the requirements of the Party and the people. In order to further adapt to the needs of the development of the situation, we are determined to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher on the existing basis and advance victoriously.

    在党的文艺方针照耀下的“老调”剧种
    中共河北省保定地委代理第一书记　杨培生
    在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，我国整个国民经济在突飞猛进，文化艺术事业也在一日千里地蓬勃发展。早在1949年，毛主席就曾经预言：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”实践证明，毛主席的科学预见是完全正确的。
    保定地区的文化艺术工作和全国各地一样，在党中央和省委的正确领导下，十几年来，全区的文化艺术工作也有了很大的发展。特别是大跃进以来，为了适应经济形势发展的需要，满足广大群众日益增长的物质文化要求，各级党委本着一手抓政治，一手抓生产，同时搞好人民生活的精神，进一步加强了对文化艺术工作的领导。地委根据中央和省委积极培植、发展地方剧种的指示，对我区具有独特色彩、为广大人民群众喜闻乐见的“老调”剧种，进行了培养、提高和发展的工作。
    “老调”是保定地区大型剧种之一，据传产生于元末明初。它有一百多个传统剧目，二百多支音乐曲牌，唱腔朴实，婉转动听，具有独特的民间艺术风格，深受广大劳动群众的喜爱。但是，在国民党和日寇的反动统治下，不仅没有得到发展、提高，反而遭受了极大的摧残。广大艺人受污辱蹂躏，政治上没有保障，生活上陷于绝境。许多艺人弃艺归农，也有的流离失所，死无葬身之地。解放前，这个剧种已经奄奄一息，几乎绝种灭迹。解放后，在毛泽东文艺思想和党的文艺方针的指导下，经过党和政府的大力培植，老调剧种才枯木逢春，成长、繁荣、壮大起来。
    为了迅速恢复、继承和发展老调剧种，保定地委于1959年将高阳县老调剧团扩大成专区老调剧团，作为地委深入贯彻执行党的文艺方针、培植地方剧种的试验田，并以此为重点带动和指导全区整个戏曲事业的发展。两年来，在中央和省委的关怀和大力扶植之下，依靠广大演员和艺术工作者的积极努力，老调剧团已经成长壮大起来了。现在广大演员和艺术工作者的政治思想觉悟空前提高，干劲十足，因而艺术水平也得到了很大的提高。两年来，不仅抢救、恢复、整理了很多传统剧目，排演了大批为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的现代剧，丰富了人民生活，促进了生产的发展，配合了政治思想战线上的社会主义革命；而且在普及与提高两条腿走路的方针指导下，以跃进的步伐排演了思想水平和艺术水平较高的“潘杨讼”、“井台会”、“盘夫”等优秀剧目。这些初步的成绩，是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利，是贯彻执行党的总路线和文艺方针的结果。
    我们在复兴老调剧种工作中采取的主要措施是：
    第一，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    随着社会主义革命和建设事业的深入发展，我们从实践中深深体会到，在新的历史阶段，文化艺术工作在促进生产、配合改造上层建筑等方面，所起的作用是很大的。因此，地委除将整个文化艺术工作列入党的议事日程外，并本着搞样板、树标兵、由点及面、总结经验、指导全面的精神，从1959年将高阳老调剧团调为专区剧团后，便加强了对专区老调剧团的具体领导。首先是加强思想领导。地委除在财力、物力上给予大力支持，并抽调了一批得力的干部充实了老调剧团的领导核心，加强政治思想领导外，地委书记处书记、宣传部长等主要负责干部也经常深入剧团，亲自听取剧团的汇报，检查剧团的排演和演出情况；同时，针对每个时期演员和其他戏曲工作者政治思想上存在的主要倾向和问题，及时地给予指导和教育。地委书记处书记宋琏同志还具体指导过排演工作。其次剧团根据地委指示，坚持了政治第一，政治、文化、艺术全面跃进的方针。广大演员在党的无微不至的培养、关怀、教育下，迅速成长起来了。王贯英、陈淑缓、周淑琴、白玉昌、辛秋花等青年演员由于觉悟的提高，光荣地参加了中国共产党。同时，他们由于政治觉悟的提高，严格要求自己，努力学习，因而文化水平和艺术水平也迅速地得到提高，在全体演员中树立了沿着既红又专道路跃进的榜样。第二，坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动。这是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中最根本的经验之一，也是文化艺术工作高速度发展的根本经验。为了在剧团中掌握运用这条经验，我们在老调剧团中从编剧到演出，采取了集思广益，群策群力的方法。在编写整理剧本方面，克服了过去少数人员关起门来冷冷清清搞创作的作法，而是采取领导干部、导演、演员、音乐、美术工作者都参加编写、整理、修改剧本的工作。如“潘杨讼”、“盘夫”、“井台会”等剧本都是经过几十个人的动口、动手集体整理出来的。在排演方面，发动了群众性的献计献策运动，每排一个新戏，党组织都号召广大演员、职工出计谋、想办法、献身段、献唱腔，并强调演员深入实际，体验生活，这样就提高了排戏的速度和质量。同时，结合演出，剧团还广泛征求了观众的意见。仅“潘杨讼”一剧就邀请观众代表进行了五次座谈，提出了近五百条宝贵意见，弥补了导演和演员许多想不到的缺点。实践证明，在戏曲工作中坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，不仅能够迅速地提高艺术水平，更重要的是只有这样才能迅速地改造文艺工作者的思想，树立相信群众、依靠群众的作风。因此坚持群众路线、大搞群众运动的过程，实质上也是提高、改造文艺工作者思想的过程。
    第三，强调戏曲艺术深入实际、深入生活，从现实斗争中扩大演员的眼界，提高认识，改造思想，增强戏曲艺术的思想性和艺术性。1959年专区老调剧团共演出四百二十多场次，其中上山下乡深入实际演出占演出场次的80％。王快、西大洋等水库和一些厂矿的英雄们，每看到一次演出，革命干劲和工作效率都有显著提高；同时各个战线上高速度跃进的成绩，也大大促进了广大演员勤学苦练的干劲和政治觉悟的大大提高。现在，老调剧种已和广大的工农兵建立了深厚的革命友谊，思想根子已深深扎在劳动人民中间。因此，广大群众像慈母般地热爱、关怀着这支新生力量的成长壮大。实践证明，只有深入实际，深入群众，参与实际斗争，才能正确地、深入地贯彻执行为政治、为社会主义建设、为工农兵服务的文艺方针，充分发挥文艺工作促进生产，改造上层建筑、意识形态方面潜移默化的作用；也只有这样，才能使广大文艺工作者，在实际斗争中锻炼、改造、提高思想水平和艺术水平。
    第四，坚持两条腿走路的方针。遵照毛主席提出的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲方针，既继承了老调剧种的优秀传统，又突破传统大胆地进行了革新，并努力吸收了兄弟剧种的成就。因为社会在前进，人民的文化水平和艺术欣赏能力在不断提高，任何一种艺术，如果故步自封，停滞不前，就会脱离群众和为时代所淘汰，这实际是扼杀了遗产。我们在复兴老调剧种的工作中，首先组织力量根据名老艺人的回忆口述，挖掘抄录了老调的传统剧目和音乐曲牌，然后经过整理加工，在继承传统的基础上，进行了革新。如“潘杨讼”中的“调寇”一场，就是继承了老调剧种婉转优美的唱腔和艺术表演程式，去掉了统治阶级所刻划的寇准低三下四的奴才相，突出了寇准公正忠良、智谋深广的性格，使他在观众心目中站立起来了。另外，我们为了丰富老调剧种的艺术，还向兄弟剧种学习了他们的优秀剧目，如向河北省青年跃进梆子剧团学习了“挡马”；同时还破除迷信，排演了“母女俩”等二十多个受观众欢迎的现代剧目。在党的鼓励下，从1954年起，老调剧种第一次有了女演员，目前很多女演员担任了主角，彻底改变了历史上老调剧种男扮女装的局面，繁荣了这一剧种。
    在中央和省委的正确领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们在抢救、恢复、发展老调剧种的工作中，虽然取得了一些成绩，但是距离党和人民的要求还很远，为了进一步适应形势发展的需要，我们决心在现有基础上，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，乘胜前进。
