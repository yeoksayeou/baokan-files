Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: According to Soviet newspapers, the Gaganova movement of learning from the advanced to help the backward is not only flourishing in Soviet industrial and mining enterprises, but also in the commercial sector.

The first to propose the idea of transferring from advanced stores to backward stores was Comrade Alefeeva, the female manager and Communist Party member of the advanced retail store, No. 42 Clothing and Sundries Store, in Moscow. In July 1959, she obtained the approval of the higher authorities and transferred to Store No. 38 in Moscow. Under her leadership, Store No. 38 completed its work plan by 106.6% in August of last year, and exceeded the plan by 120% in September. By the end of the year, Alefeeva's promise had been fulfilled: Store No. 38 had already escaped its old backward state and become one of the advanced stores in the capital.

Before Alefeeva went to work in the backward unit, she had considered that she would encounter various difficulties. However, she saw that when Gaganova began to lead the backward production team, the work was not easy either, but Gaganova worked hard and overcame difficulties with her comrades, and finally quickly changed the face of the backward production team. Alefeeva finally concluded: "Communists do not seek an easy path in life." When the higher authorities approved her to go to work in Store No. 38, Alefeeva happily stated: "I resolutely obey the assignment, I am not afraid of all difficulties, and I will let all difficult problems be solved in front of all the staff of our Store No. 38."

After Alefeeva went to work at Store No. 38, her first impression was that almost all the salespersons were young, not patient enough with customers, and the store did not have a wide variety of goods.

Based on these circumstances, she first started by strengthening ideological work, setting an example to educate young salespersons to love their work, so that everyone could treat their work with a sense of ownership. With her enthusiastic and patient help, the salespersons became active. Now, they have not only completely changed their service attitude, but also set up stalls in nearby factories twice a month to sell goods, deliver goods to customers' homes twice a week, and actively solicit opinions from residents to improve their work.

Alefeeva's behavior, which demonstrated a high degree of communist style, was praised by the Presidium of the Central Council of the Trade Union of Workers in State Trade and Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union. The Presidium of the Central Council of the Trade Union called on all stores across the country to universally launch a movement of advanced helping the backward, and to carry out competitions with each other.

Since August of last year, the face of the Soviet commercial sector has been completely renewed. Staff from many advanced department stores, bookstores, food stores, clothing stores, and shoe stores in various union republics and border regions have gone to work in backward units. Kovalyenko, a member of the Communist Youth League and director of the Book Sales Department of the Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky District Consumer Cooperative in Ukraine, volunteered to work in the backward department of the district department store - "Children's World". In less than half a month after she arrived, the daily turnover of "Children's World" increased by 20%, and the sales of goods greatly exceeded the original plan.

Baurzhansky, the manager of Public Canteen No. 37 of a large enterprise in Moscow, applied to work in Public Canteen No. 21, which had failed to complete its tasks for a long time. When he first took on the task, the biggest difficulty facing him was that there were too few experienced cooks. Therefore, he put forward the slogan of "improving skills through work" and personally went to the kitchen to guide. Inspired by Baurzhansky, the canteen staff gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. After more than a month of diligent study and hard work, many young cooks who were previously considered "unsuitable" became culinary experts, and the appearance of the canteen changed greatly.

The movement of advanced helping the backward launched in the commercial sector is not limited to the various stores in the cities. Many advanced units in the cities have also sent people to the countryside to help rural stores improve their work. The Kuibyshev City Department Store first initiated this proposal. Suraeva, the assistant manager of the department store, went to work in a department store in a suburban district together with the salespersons. Suraeva also decided to stay there for a long time to work.

The initiative of the Kuibyshev City Department Store attracted great attention in major stores in the Soviet Union. Not long ago, Alefeeva wrote a letter to Suraeva, expressing her desire to learn from the Kuibyshev City Department Store, and decided to help raise a backward store in the suburbs of Moscow to the level of an advanced unit.

### 苏联加干诺娃运动在商业部门开花结果  先进商店职工自愿到后进商店帮助克服困难  城市先进单位派人到农村商店共同改进工作

    苏联加干诺娃运动在商业部门开花结果
    先进商店职工自愿到后进商店帮助克服困难
    城市先进单位派人到农村商店共同改进工作
    新华社莫斯科29日电　据苏联报纸报道：学习先进帮落后的加干诺娃运动不仅在苏联各工矿企业，而且也在商业部门中开花结果。
    商业部门中第一个提出从先进商店转入落后商店工作的，是莫斯科一家先进的零售商店——第四十二服饰杂货商店的女经理、共产党员阿列菲耶娃。1959年7月，她获得上级领导机关的批准，转到莫斯科第三十八号商店去工作。在她的领导下，第三十八号商店去年8月完成了工作计划106．6％，9月份又超额完成计划120％。到年底，阿列菲耶娃的诺言实现了：第三十八号商店已经摆脱旧有的落后状态，而成为首都先进的商店之一。
    阿列菲耶娃到落后单位工作以前曾经考虑过：这会遇到各种各样的困难。但是她看到，加干诺娃开始领导落后生产队的时候，工作也不容易，但加干诺娃努力工作，和同志们一道克服困难，终于迅速地改变了落后生产队的面貌。阿列菲耶娃最后得出结论：“共产党员不找容易的生活道路”。当上级批准她到第三十八号商店去工作时，阿列菲耶娃高兴地表示：“我坚决服从分配，不怕一切困难，让一切难题在我们第三十八号商店的全体工作人员面前迎刃而解。”
    阿列菲耶娃到第三十八号商店工作后，给她第一个印象是，售货员几乎全部是青年人，对顾客不够耐心，商店的货物品种也不多。
    根据这些情况，她首先从加强思想工作着手，以身作则教育年轻的售货员热爱自己的工作，使每个人都能以主人翁的态度来对待工作。售货员们在她的热情和耐心帮助下，都积极起来了。现在，他们不仅彻底改变了服务态度，而且每月两次到附近工厂去摆摊售货，每星期两次给顾客送货上门，并积极向居民征求改进工作的意见。
    阿列菲耶娃所表现的具有高度的共产主义风格的行为，受到了苏联国家贸易和消费合作社工作者工会中央理事会主席团的赞扬。工会中央理事会主席团号召全国各个商店普遍展开先进帮落后的运动，并相互间展开竞赛。
    自去年8月到现在，苏联商业部门的面貌焕然一新。各加盟共和国、各边疆区的许多先进的百货公司、书店、食品商店、服装店和鞋店的工作人员，纷纷到落后单位去工作。乌克兰佩列亚斯拉夫—赫米尔尼茨基区消费合作社书籍出售部主任、共青团员科瓦连科，自愿到区百货公司落后的部门——“儿童世界”去工作。她去了不到半月的时间，“儿童世界”每天的贸易额就增加了20％，出售的商品也大大超过原订计划。
    莫斯科一个大企业的第三十七号公共食堂的经理鲍尔江斯基，申请到长期完不成任务的第二十一号公共食堂去工作，他刚接受任务时，摆在他面前的最大困难是，有经验的炊事员太少。于是，他提出了“在工作中提高水平”的口号，并亲自下伙房指导。在鲍尔江斯基的鼓舞下，食堂工作人员充分地发挥了积极性和创造性。经过一个多月的勤学苦练，许多过去被认为“不行”的年轻炊事员，都成了烹调能手，食堂的面貌大大改观。
    商业部门中展开的先进帮落后的运动，不仅限于城市中的各个商店。许多城市里的先进单位还派人下乡帮助农村商店改进工作。古比雪夫城百货公司首先发起这一倡议。百货公司的助理经理苏拉叶娃和售货员一起，到城郊一个区的百货商店去工作。苏拉叶娃并决定长期留在那里工作。
    古比雪夫城百货公司的创举在苏联各大商店引起了极大注意。不久前，阿列菲耶娃写信给苏拉叶娃，表示要向古比雪夫城百货公司学习，并决定帮助把莫斯科近郊的一个落后商店提高到先进单位的水平。
