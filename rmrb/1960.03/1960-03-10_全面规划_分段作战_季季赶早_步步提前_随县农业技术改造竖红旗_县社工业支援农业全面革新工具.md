    Comprehensive Planning, Phased Operations, Seize the Day Every Season, Advance Step by Step
    Suixian County Sets Up a Red Flag for Agricultural Technical Transformation
    County and Commune Industries Support Agriculture with Comprehensive Tool Innovation
    (Our Newspaper Reports) Suixian County in Hubei Province has become an advanced county in the province for agricultural technical transformation. Entering Suixian County, one sees farmers transporting fertilizer by vehicles and boats, and no one is laboriously carrying burdens to transport fertilizer anymore. Water begins to irrigate the farmland by gravity, and water power is used to drive machinery to process flour, rice, and cotton. Factories in the county and communes manufacture a large number of new-style farm tools to supply the countryside.
    Recently, Wang Yanchun and Wang Shucheng, Secretaries of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, led the First Secretaries of various prefectural committees and the industrial secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county committees to hold an on-site conference on agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization here. They summarized and promoted Suixian County's experience in resolutely implementing the policy of combining industry and agriculture and local industry serving agricultural production, and vigorously carrying out agricultural tool reform. They called on all counties in the province to launch an agricultural technical transformation movement of "comparing with Suixian, learning from Suixian, and catching up with Suixian."
    Based on the Party Central Committee's guidelines for achieving agricultural modernization, and combined with the specific conditions of rural Hubei, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee proposed that the province strive to first achieve "Four Transformations and Two Eliminations" within three years (i.e., by 1962): transforming human-powered water lifting into gravity irrigation and mechanical drainage and irrigation; transforming shoulder carrying and back hauling into vehicle and boat transportation and sliding ropeway transportation; transforming backward farming tools into advanced and improved tools; transforming manual processing into mechanized and semi-mechanized processing, and finally eliminating shoulder carrying and back hauling and eliminating human-powered water lifting throughout the province. The people of Suixian County actively responded to the Party's call, and local industry fully supported agriculture, vigorously carrying out tool reform, which powerfully promoted the development of agricultural technical transformation. In about a year, the county basically realized water conservancy; 80% of the 1.5 million mu of paddy fields achieved gravity irrigation, and 20% basically achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized drainage and irrigation. On average, there is one cart for every two standard laborers in the county, basically eliminating the phenomenon of shoulder carrying and back hauling that has existed for thousands of years. In terms of farming tools, the county has also basically realized deep plowing and strip sowing, and 50% of the tools for inter-row cultivation and weeding have been improved. Currently, they are rushing to manufacture rice transplanters and harvesters. The processing of agricultural and sideline products in the county has generally been changed from manual processing to hydropower, power, and animal power processing. Recently, the Lishan Commune built 87 hydropower joint processing plants and stations along the Cheshuigou Canal, forming a one-stop semi-mechanized processing network. This experience is being rapidly promoted throughout the county. It is estimated that more than 900 hydropower joint processing plants will continue to be established throughout the county this year, so that the county's agricultural and sideline products will be basically completely converted to hydropower automated production.
    Since 1959, the Suixian County Party Committee and the Party Committees of various communes have grasped agriculture with one hand and industry with the other. Agriculture proposed the problems (presenting the needs), and industry wrote the articles (serving agriculture), seizing every agricultural season, preparing in advance, fighting in stages, and carrying out mass key-problem solving campaigns. Last year, the county organized five mass movements of industry supporting agriculture and vigorously carrying out tool reform in accordance with different agricultural seasons such as spring plowing, summer harvesting, drought resistance, autumn harvesting, and winter planting, creating and improving a total of more than 230 kinds of tools and popularizing more than 740,000 pieces. Last year, a total of 40 million labor days were saved.

    全面规划　分段作战　季季赶早　步步提前
    随县农业技术改造竖红旗
    县社工业支援农业全面革新工具
    本报讯　湖北省的随县已成为全省农业技术改造的先进县。进入随县境，只见农民都在用车船运送肥料，再也没有人吃力地挑着担子送肥了。水开始自流灌溉着农田，并利用水力带动机具，加工面粉、大米和棉花。县和公社的农具厂里制造出大批新式农具，供应农村。
    最近，中共湖北省委书记处书记王延春、王树成带领各地委第一书记和地、市、县委工业书记，在这里召开了农业半机械化和机械化的现场会议，总结和推广随县坚决贯彻工农业并举和地方工业为农业生产服务的方针，大搞农业工具改革的经验，并号召全省各县展开“比随县、学随县、赶随县”的农业技术改造运动。
    湖北省委根据党中央提出实现农业现代化的方针，结合湖北农村具体情况，提出全省争取三年内（即到1962年）首先实现“四改两消灭”——把人力车水改为自流灌溉和机械排灌；把肩挑背驮改为车船运输和滑丝滑道运输；把落后的耕作工具改为先进的改良工具；把用人力加工改为机械化、半机械化加工，最后在全省范围内消灭肩挑背驮，消灭人力车水。随县人民积极响应了党的号召，地方工业全力支援农业，大搞工具改革，有力地促进了农业技术改造的发展。在一年时间左右，全县基本上实现了水利化，一百五十万亩水田80％做到了自流灌溉，有20％基本实现了排灌机械化、半机械化；全县平均每两个标准劳动力有一部板车，基本消灭了几千年来的肩挑背驮现象；在耕作工具方面，全县也基本实现了深耕犁化和条播器化，50％的中耕除草工具进行了改良，目前正在赶造插秧机、收割机；全县的农、副产品加工，已经由人力加工普遍改为水力、动力和畜力加工。最近厉山公社在车水沟大渠沿线建造起水力联合加工厂、站八十七处，形成为一条龙式半机械化加工网。这个经验正在迅速向全县推广，预计今年内全县将继续建立九百多处水力联合加工厂，使全县农、副产品基本上全部改为水力自动化生产。
    自1959年以来，随县县委和各公社党委一手抓农业，一手抓工业，农业出题目（提出需要），工业做文章（为农业服务），抓住每个农业季节，提前准备，分段作战，开展群众性攻关战役。去年全县根据春耕、夏收、抗旱、秋收、冬种等不同的农事季节，连续组织了五次工业支援农业、大搞工具改革的群众运动，共计创制、改良了二百三十多种工具，推广了七十四万多件。去年共节约了四千万个劳动日。
