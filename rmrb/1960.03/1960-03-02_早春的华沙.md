    Early Spring in Warsaw
    By Our Correspondent Li Ke
    White primroses have appeared on the streets of Warsaw, announcing the arrival of spring to the citizens. A gentle, not-too-cold breeze is chasing away the last vestiges of winter, awakening the sleeping earth. In the heart of the garden, small grasses peek out from beneath the remaining snow, revealing a patch of new green. The famous Łazienki Park and the area around the Warsaw Mermaid statue have once again become lively with crowds of visitors. The Vistula River, frozen solid during the harsh winter, has thawed and is swollen with water.

    The arrival of spring fills everything with vitality. The labor emulation movement in Warsaw's factories is expanding daily, like a robust new sprout growing in spring. Hundreds of labor production teams are participating in the national competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team." The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party on carrying out technical innovation has enlivened the daily life of the factories. In the words of a Polish comrade, "How to adopt new technologies and how to improve labor productivity are currently the hottest topics in Warsaw factories." In the spacious workshops of the Żerań Automobile Factory, in front of the huge open-hearth furnaces of the Warsaw Quality Steel Plant, and on the scaffolding of construction workers building new houses for the citizens, workers are discussing the same thing: how to improve production. The slogan put forward by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party that people and their socialist consciousness are the guarantee of technological progress has touched the hearts of all workers. Many factories have begun to implement new labor quotas, and workers are throwing themselves into intense labor with vigor and enthusiasm.

    The slogan of technological progress has also attracted Warsaw's technical and intellectual circles. For the first time, the Polish United Workers' Party invited non-Party intellectuals to participate in its Fourth Plenary Session, listening to many meaningful suggestions from non-Party intellectuals on technological progress. This has enhanced and encouraged the socialist construction awareness and sense of responsibility of the technical and intellectual circles. "The integration of scientific research and production" has become a resounding slogan in intellectual circles this spring.

    Farmers in the suburbs are also busy in the spring. Carts transporting fertilizer appear one after another on the field roads. Farmers are constantly observing the fields soaked with melting snow, waiting for and selecting the most suitable sowing season. Due to the drought last autumn, the area sown last autumn was small, so this year's spring sowing task is much larger than in previous years. Suburban farmers have been busy accumulating fertilizer, selecting seeds, and repairing farm tools early on, in order to strive for a greater harvest this year.

    The celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Polish people's singer and great composer Chopin has added a touch of spring to Warsaw. Eighty-six young pianists under the age of thirty from thirty-one countries are participating in the Sixth International Chopin Piano Competition. This is the largest Chopin Piano Competition in history. World-renowned musicians have also gathered in Warsaw for this event. These days, the Warsaw National Philharmonic Hall, where the competition is being held, has become the focus of attention for the entire city. Every day, Chopin's tunes, full of patriotism and fighting spirit, are transmitted from there, making Warsaw a city full of beautiful musical melodies.

    The literary and artistic fields also show a thriving scene in the spring. The new play "The First Day of Freedom" by Kruczkowski, which is currently being staged, has become one of the most eye-catching plays in recent times. The creative activities of Marxist writers have become active. The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party has recently established a new Ministry of Culture and a Ministry of Science and Education to strengthen leadership in the cultural field.

    A well-known cultural worker optimistically told reporters: "Spring is a season full of hope. It is hoped that colorful flowers will bloom in our literary and artistic fields."

    Although the chill of early spring still strikes from time to time, it can no longer stop all outdoor activities. On the roads leading to the suburbs, bicycles speed past from time to time, perhaps the athletes preparing to participate in the Warsaw-Berlin-Prague bicycle race. In the blue sky and white clouds above Warsaw, where flocks of pigeons fly, the shadows of gliders appear. These are all signs of spring in Warsaw.

    早春的华沙
    本报记者　李克
    华沙街头上白色的报春花已经上市，它向市民们宣告了春天到来的消息。拂面不寒的微风在驱赶着最后的冬寒，唤醒着沉睡的土地。街心花园里的小草从残存的积雪下面探出头来，泛出一片新绿，著名的瓦建卡公园里和华沙美人鱼雕像四周，重又恢复了往昔游人众多的热闹场面。严冬季节封冻了的维斯杜拉河已经解冻，涨满了江水。
    春天的来临使一切都充满了生机。华沙各工厂的劳动竞赛运动日益扩展开来，像是春天里生长的一棵茁壮的新芽，已经有成百的劳动生产队参加了全国争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。波兰统一工人党四中全会关于开展技术革新的决议，活跃了工厂的日常生活。用一位波兰同志的话说：“如何采用新技术，如何提高劳动生产率，是目前华沙工厂中最热烈的话题。”在泽兰汽车厂宽大的车间里，在华沙优质钢厂巨大的平炉前，以及在为市民们建筑新房的建筑工人的脚手架上，工人们都在讨论着同一件事：如何提高生产。党的四中全会提出的关于人和他的社会主义觉悟是技术进步的保证这个口号，打动了全体工人的心。不少工厂开始试行新的劳动定额，工人们以蓬勃的朝气和热情，投身于紧张的劳动。
    技术进步的口号也吸引了华沙的技术知识界，波兰统一工人党第一次邀请了党外知识分子参加自己的四中全会，听取了党外知识分子关于技术进步的许多有意义的建议。这提高和鼓舞了技术知识界对社会主义建设的觉悟和责任感。“科学研究和生产相结合”成了今春知识界中一句响亮的口号。
    郊区的农民在春天里也忙碌起来。田间道路上出现了一辆又一辆的运送肥料的车子，农民们不断在浸润着雪水的田野上进行观察，等待和选择着最适宜的下种季节。由于去秋天旱，去年秋播面积小，所以今年春播任务要比往年大得多，郊区农民很早就忙着积肥、选种和修理农具，以争取今年更大的丰收。
    庆祝波兰人民的歌手、伟大作曲家萧邦诞生一百五十周年的活动，使华沙凭添了一番春色。有来自三十一个国家的八十六位不满三十岁的年轻的钢琴家参加第六届国际萧邦钢琴演奏比赛。这是萧邦钢琴比赛会有史以来规模最盛大的一次。世界著名的音乐家也因此云集华沙。这些天来，比赛会所在地华沙国家音乐厅成了全市注意的中心。每天从那里传出萧邦的充满爱国主义和战斗气息的曲调。这使华沙成了充满音乐的优美旋律的城市。
    文艺园地在春天里也显出欣欣向荣的景象。正在上演的克鲁奇科夫斯基的新剧“自由的第一天”成了近来最引人注目的剧目之一。马克思主义作家的创作活动已活跃起来。波兰统一工人党中央最近又新成立了文化部和科学教育部，加强对文化方面的领导。
    一位著名的文化工作者乐观地对记者说：“春天是充满希望的季节。可以希望我们的文艺园地里会开放出鲜艳的花朵。”
    尽管初春的寒意仍不时袭来，但已不能阻挡露天的一切活动。在通往郊区的马路上，不时有一辆辆自行车疾驶而过，这也许是准备参加华沙—柏林—布拉格自行车比赛的选手。在华沙上空的蓝天白云间，在成群的鸽子飞过的地方，出现了滑翔机的影子。这都是华沙的春天的标志。
