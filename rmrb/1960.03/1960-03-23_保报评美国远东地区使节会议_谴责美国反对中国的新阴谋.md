Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 21st. The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary today exposing the secret meeting recently held by U.S. envoys to the Far East in Baguio, Philippines, to plot new conspiracies against China.

The commentary said that, according to Western news agency reports, the main topic of the meeting was to discuss measures against China. One measure recommended by the meeting was: "Under no circumstances should People's China be admitted to the United Nations, because this would mean the bankruptcy of the U.S. position in Asia." The commentary pointed out that this is the old "Cold War" position that the people of all countries have already abandoned.

The commentary said that China's legitimate seat in the United Nations should and must be restored, because this is firmly demanded by the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

    保报评美国远东地区使节会议
    谴责美国反对中国的新阴谋
    新华社索非亚21日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”今天发表评论，揭露美国驻远东地区的使节最近在菲律宾碧瑶举行秘密会议，策划反对中国的新阴谋。
    评论说，根据西方通讯社的报道，这次会议主要是讨论反对中国的措施，这次会议建议采取的一个措施是：“无论如何也不能接受人民中国加入联合国，因为这意味着美国在亚洲的立场的破产”。评论指出，这是各国人民已经弃绝了的陈旧的“冷战”立场。
    评论说，应当而且一定要恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位，因为这是亚洲和世界和平的利益所坚决要求的。
