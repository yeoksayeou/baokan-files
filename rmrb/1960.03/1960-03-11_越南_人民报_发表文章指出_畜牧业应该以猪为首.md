The Vietnamese "People's Daily" Publishes Article Pointing Out that Animal Husbandry Should Prioritize Pigs
This Year's Plan Aims to Achieve an Average of 1.5 to 2 Pigs Per Household

(Reported by this newspaper) On February 13th, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a short article titled "Animal Husbandry Should Prioritize Pigs." The following is a summary:

Among livestock, the main ones are yellow cattle, water buffalo, pigs, and chickens. Each yellow cattle or water buffalo is a tractor. Without oxen, farmers cannot plow the land, so oxen must be carefully managed and actively developed. However, from the perspective of meat supply and the source of income for each household, pigs are the top priority. According to incomplete statistics, before September 1959, the income from pigs accounted for 15% to 18% of the total income of each household in the north, and in some places, it accounted for 20% to 30%.

Pigs reproduce quickly, and raising pigs can not only provide meat but also fertilizer. Most of our current fertilizer is pig manure.

In recent years, we have made some achievements in developing pig farming, preventing and controlling swine fever, and improving breeds. However, generally speaking, our pig farming industry is still very backward. Some comrades in the Party committees at all levels believe that leading pig farming is a low-level job and not a task for the Party committee. In many cooperatives, pig farming is not encouraged. Some places believe that developing pig farming on a household basis violates the line of developing cooperatives. The above erroneous understanding must be overcome in a timely manner.

Some people still believe that pigs can only be raised with bran. Of course, bran is pig feed, but it is not the only feed, nor is it the main feed. Historically, farmers have used vegetables, corn, peanut shells, and other things to raise pigs. As livestock farming develops more and more, we cannot always maintain this method of solving the feed problem, and we must actively grow the above-mentioned feeds. Agricultural cooperatives must reserve some land to grow feed.

According to the 1960 plan, the entire north is to raise 4.5 million pigs. In mountainous areas, each household will raise an average of two pigs, and every three households will raise one sow. In plain areas, an average of three pigs will be raised for every two households, and one sow will be raised for every six households. As long as the Party committees and governments at all levels strengthen their leadership over pig farming, we have sufficient conditions to achieve this goal.

    越南“人民报”发表文章指出
    畜牧业应该以猪为首
    今年计划实现每户平均养一头半到两头猪的指标
    本报讯　2月13日越南“人民报”发表一篇题为“畜牧业以猪为首”的短文。摘要如下：
    家畜中以黄牛、水牛、猪、鸡为主。每一头黄牛或水牛是一部拖拉机。没有耕牛，农民就不能犁地，因此耕牛必须小心管理和积极发展，但从供应肉食和每户的收入来源看，猪占头等地位。据不完全统计，1959年9月以前，全北方每户的收入中，猪的收入占15％至18％，有的地方占20％至30％。
    猪的繁殖快，养猪不仅可以得到肉，而且还有肥料。我们目前的肥料大部分是猪粪。
    几年来，我们在发展养猪、防治猪的瘟疫和改良品种方面获得一些成绩，但一般说来，我们的养猪业还很落后，各级党委中有些同志认为领导养猪是低级的工作，不是党委会的任务。在许多合作社中，养猪业得不到鼓励。有的地方认为逐户发展养猪是违反发展合作社的路线。上述错误认识必须及时克服。
    有一部分人仍认为要有糠才能养猪。当然，糠是猪饲料，但并非是唯一的饲料，也不是主要的饲料，历来农民就用菜、玉米、花生壳等养猪。由于家畜日益发展，我们不能总是保持这种解决饲养的办法，必须主动多种上述饲料，农业合作社必须留一部分土地来种饲料。
    据1960年计划，全北方要养四百五十万只猪。在山区，每户平均养两只猪，每三户养一只母猪。在平原地区，平均每两户养三只猪，每六户养一只母猪。只要各级党委和各级政府加强对养猪的领导，我们有足够的条件来实现这一指标。
