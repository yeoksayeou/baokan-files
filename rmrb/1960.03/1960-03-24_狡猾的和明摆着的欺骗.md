    Cunning and Blatant Deception
    Editor's Note: The American "I.F. Stone's Weekly" published an article on March 21st entitled "Weak, Sly and Obvious," revealing that the American "disarmament" plan is actually a non-disarmament plan. Excerpts are translated below:
    The State Department's "Working Paper on General Disarmament," published on the eve of the Geneva disarmament talks, is disappointing in both form and substance. It is so vague and so complicated that no one can say what it means until after months of negotiation.
    In substance, it is no better. This plan—if it is more vague—also leaves greater room for negotiation. But in other respects, it is a step backward. Let us take the simple question of the number of armed forces as an example. Eight years ago, in May 1952, we initially proposed a maximum limit of 1.5 million each for the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. Now we propose a maximum limit of 2.5 million each for the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union, and then reduce it to 2.1 million. When we called the Pentagon to inquire about the latest figures for the U.S. armed forces, the reply was 2,490,035. Therefore, in the first stage of this disarmament plan, we would have to recruit another 9,965 soldiers! For years, we have been saying that we must have nuclear weapons to offset the Soviet armed "hordes" and insisting that we must first reduce conventional forces before we "ban the atom bomb." After all these years, we are now talking about having a larger army than Russia.
    The new proposal is arranged to combine maximum inspection with minimum disarmament: the former to be implemented early, while the latter is to be waited for until the final farewell. This is most evident in the missile issue. Our plan requires the Russians to reveal their missile launch sites to the international disarmament organization that wants to go to "the scene to inspect the launch sites" in the initial stage, but puts the elimination of nuclear weapons and launching systems in the final stage—which officials here jokingly refer to as "a thousand years." Our proposal is vague even for a thousand years, talking about prohibiting the production of "nuclear, chemical, biological and other weapons of mass destruction," but not about prohibiting the use of these weapons. It vaguely refers to "monitoring the production of various missiles agreed upon by all parties... and the final destruction of such missiles." If we want to destroy them, why monitor them? There is no time limit for each stage, and it may take several years of inspection before monitoring, and several more years of monitoring before "destruction."
    This weak and blatant deception reflects the thinking of military figures who do not like disarmament at all.

### 狡猾的和明摆着的欺骗

    狡猾的和明摆着的欺骗
    编者按　美国的“斯通周刊”3月21日刊登了一篇题为“软弱的、狡猾的和明摆着的”的文章，透露了美国的“裁军”计划实际上是个不裁军的方案。现摘译如下：
    国务院在日内瓦裁军谈判的前夕发表的“关于普遍裁军的工作文件”，在方式和实质内容上都是令人失望的。它是如此含糊如此复杂，以致在经过几个月的谈判以前没有一个人能说出它的意义。
    在实质方面，它也好不到什么地方去。这个方案——如果说它更含糊的话——也有容许谈判的较大的余地。但是，在其他方面，它是后退了一步。让我们来以关于武装部队的人数的这一简单的问题为例。八年前，在1952年5月，我们开始时建议美国、苏联的武装部队的最高限额各为一百五十万人。而现在我们建议美国和苏联的武装部队最高限额各为二百五十万人，以后再降为二百一十万人。当我们打电话给五角大楼询问美国武装部队最新的数字时，答复是二百四十九万零三十五人。因此，我们在这一裁军方案的第一阶段还得再招募九千九百六十五名士兵！这些年来，我们一直在说我们必须拥有核军备来抵消苏联武装的“人群”，并坚持说在我们“禁止原子弹”之前首先必须裁减常规部队。在过了这些年之后，现在我们又在谈论拥有比俄国更大的军队的问题了。
    新的建议的安排是把最大限度的视察和最低限度的裁军结合在一起：前者要及早实行，而后者则要等到最后言欢握别的时候。在导弹问题上这点最为明显。我们的方案要求在初期阶段让俄国人向要到“现场去视察发射场”的国际裁军组织透露他们的导弹发射场，但是却把消灭核武器和发射体系的问题放在最后阶段——这里的官方人士在谈到这个阶段时诙谐地认为是“一千年的事”。我们的建议甚至对于一千年的时间来说也是含糊的，它谈到了禁止生产“核、化学、生物和其他大规模毁灭性武器”，但是没有谈到禁止使用这些武器的问题。它含糊其词地谈到“监督大家商定的各种导弹的生产……和最后销毁这类导弹”。如果我们希望销毁它们，又为什么要监督呢？对于各个阶段没有规定时限，可能要经过若干年视察后才进行监督，再经过若干年监督才进行“销毁”。
    这种软弱的明摆着的欺骗反映了军界人士的想法，他们一点也不喜欢裁军。
