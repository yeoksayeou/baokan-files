Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 15th: People of all ethnic groups in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province held a grand gathering in Mangshi, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, on the 14th, to warmly celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement. Burmese friends, headed by Colonel So Min, commander of the 7th Brigade of the Burmese Federal Defense Forces, were invited by Colonel Ding Yi, commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army garrison in Tengchong, to attend the celebration.

That day, the border town of Mangshi was immersed in an atmosphere of joy and friendship. Under the lush green Bodhi trees and among the banana groves, thousands of red flags fluttered in the wind. The national flags of China and Burma flew over the celebration venue, and slogans were posted and hung along the streets: "The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression embodies the 'Paukphaw' (sibling) relationship of the two peoples!" "The Sino-Burmese agreement on the border issue is a model for Asian countries to rationally resolve border disputes!" "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" "Long live the unity of Asian and African countries!"

From early morning, the Dai, Jingpo, De'ang, Lisu and Han people living on China's border put on their colorful ethnic costumes, beat elephant-foot drums, danced peacock dances, performed dragon lanterns, and happily came to Mangshi, young and old. Since their ancestors, they have lived in harmony with the people of neighboring Burma, sharing the same river and living on the same mountain, and many have even become relatives. Since the prime ministers of China and Burma jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the traditional deep friendship between the border people of the two countries has been further consolidated and developed. People will never forget that three years ago, the unprecedented Sino-Burmese border people's get-together was held in Mangshi. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe personally came from afar to attend the get-together. Since then, the friendly exchanges between the border people and local military and government officials of China and Burma have become more frequent, and the friendship between the people on the borders of the two countries has grown day by day. When the good news of the recent signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement by the two governments reached the Yunnan border area, it conformed to the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups on the border. Therefore, they attended the celebration with particularly excitement on this day.

The celebration began at 2 p.m. After the band played the national anthems of China and Burma, Wang Zhixiang, Deputy Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, spoke at the meeting. He said: Today, the people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture warmly celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Border Agreement in Mangshi, and we warmly welcome the Burmese friends headed by Colonel So Min to participate. He said that the signing of these two documents is a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which marks a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Burma and sets a new example for the unity and friendship of Asian countries.

Wang Zhixiang said that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement is a major happy event for the people of the two countries. The Sino-Burmese border issue is a complex issue left over by imperialism. Imperialism once used the Sino-Burmese border issue to create disputes and provoke the friendly relations between the two peoples. However, since our two countries gained independence, the friendship between the two countries has developed further since the prime ministers of the two countries advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954, which provided a new basis for resolving the border issue between the two sides. On January 28, the two governments signed an agreement on the border issue, paving the way for a comprehensive solution to the border issue. The people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture, like the people of the whole country, express their heartfelt support and warm congratulations on the signing of this agreement.

Wang Zhixiang said that at the same time as the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement was signed, the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression was also signed. This treaty is a further development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the two countries, and it embodies the "Paukphaw" relationship between the people of our two countries. Without a doubt, this treaty will become an important milestone in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations.

He said that our Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture is connected to the Kachin State and Shan State of Burma by mountains and rivers, and the villages face each other. The border people of the two countries have always lived in friendship, and many have become relatives. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture have made brilliant achievements in industrial and agricultural production, culture, education, and health. At present, we are working hard to continue to leap forward in 1960. We cherish the friendly relations with the Burmese people and will contribute our strength to consolidate and develop this friendly relationship. Wang Zhixiang finally said that the border people of China and Burma were friendly in the past, and in the future, due to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, the border between our two countries will also be a friendly border.

Colonel So Min, commander of the 7th Brigade of the Burmese Federal Defense Forces, spoke at the celebration at the invitation. He said: The border issue left over from history between China and Burma is a disaster left by imperialism to the people of the two countries. The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement signed by the prime ministers of our two countries this time will prevent unexpected disputes and frictions between our two countries and ensure the friendly relations between our two countries. These two great treaties and agreements shocked the imperialists. They believe that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems cannot be consolidated and lasting. The two treaties and agreements signed by our two countries have set a good example for adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and are also great good news for the border defense forces and border people of all ethnic groups in our two countries. At the end of his speech, Colonel So Min shouted: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese armies!" "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" "Long live world peace!"

Si Weizhang (Dai nationality) and Lei Chunguo (Jingpo nationality), Deputy Governors of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Colonel Ding Yi, commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army garrison in Tengchong, and representatives of workers, farmers, youth, and religious circles of the autonomous prefecture also spoke at the celebration. In their speeches, they unanimously supported the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement and expressed their willingness to consolidate and develop the traditional friendship between the border people of China and Burma with practical actions in their respective positions.

After the celebration, the leaders of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture took a group photo with the Burmese friends headed by Colonel So Min. Wang Zhixiang, Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, and Colonel Ding Yi, commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army garrison in Tengchong, presented gifts to the Burmese friends.

In the evening, Deputy Governor Wang Zhixiang hosted a banquet for Colonel So Min and the Burmese friends. After the banquet, a get-together was held. The atmosphere of joy and friendship enveloped the border town of Mangshi.

    热烈庆祝中缅友好条约和边界问题协定的签订
    云南边境各族人民盛大集会
    以苏敏上校为首的缅甸朋友们应邀参加，欢乐友好气氛笼罩边城芒市
    新华社昆明15日电　云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州各族人民一万多人14日在自治州首府芒市举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国边界问题协定的签订。以缅甸联邦国防军第七旅旅长苏敏上校为首的缅甸朋友们，应我国腾冲驻军指挥官丁一上校的邀请，前来参加了庆祝大会。
    这天，边城芒市沉浸在一片欢乐和友好的气氛中。在浓绿的菩提树下，香蕉林间，千百面红旗迎风招展。庆祝大会会场上飘扬着中缅两国的国旗，街道两旁贴着和挂着标语：“中缅友好和互不侵犯条约体现了两国人民亲如手足的‘胞波’关系！”“中缅关于两国边界问题的协定是亚洲国家之间合理解决边界争端的范例！”“中缅友谊万古长青！”“亚非国家团结万岁！”
    从早晨起，居住在我国边境的傣族、景颇族、崩龙族、傈僳族和汉族人民都穿上了鲜艳的民族服装，敲着象脚鼓、跳着孔雀舞、耍着龙灯，扶老携幼、欢天喜地来到芒市。他们从祖祖辈辈以来，就同邻邦缅甸人民和睦相处，共饮一江水，共住一座山，许多人还结成了亲戚关系。自从中缅两国总理共同倡导了和平共处五项原则以后，两国边民的传统的深厚友谊有了进一步的巩固和发展。人们永远不会忘记，三年前的冬天，曾在芒市举行过盛况空前的中缅两国边民联欢大会，我国周恩来总理和缅甸联邦当时的总理吴巴瑞，都亲自远道赶来参加了那次联欢会。从那以后，中缅两国边民和地方军政负责人员相互的友好往来更加频繁，两国边境人民之间的友谊与日俱增。当最近两国政府签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国边界问题协定的喜讯，传到云南边疆后，正符合边境各族人民的愿望，因此，他们这天怀着特别兴奋的心情来参加庆祝大会。
    庆祝大会在下午二时开始。乐队奏了中缅两国国歌后，德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长王之祥首先在会上讲话。他说：今天，我们全州各族人民在芒市热烈地庆祝中缅两国友好和互不侵犯条约及边界问题协定的签订，并且有以苏敏上校为首的缅甸朋友们前来参加，对此我们表示热烈的欢迎。他说，这两个文件的签订，是和平共处五项原则的胜利，它标志着中缅两国的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段，并为亚洲各国的团结友好树立了一个新的范例。
    王之祥说，中缅两国关于边界问题协定的签订，是两国人民的一件大喜事。中缅边界问题是帝国主义遗留下来的一个复杂的问题。帝国主义曾利用中缅边界问题，制造争端，挑拨两国人民的友好关系。但是，从我们两国各自取得独立之后，由于两国人民都有着睦邻相处和友好的共同愿望，特别自1954年两国总理倡导和平共处五项原则以来，两国的友谊有了进一步的发展，因而为解决双方的边界问题提供了新的基础。1月28日两国政府就边界问题签订了协定，为全面解决边界问题铺平了道路。我州各族人民和全国人民一样，对这个协定的签订，表示衷心的拥护和热烈的祝贺。
    王之祥说，在签订两国边界问题协定的同时，还签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约。这个条约是两国所共同倡议的和平共处五项原则的进一步发展，它体现了我们两国人民亲如手足的“胞波”关系。毫无疑问，这个条约将成为中缅友好关系史上的一个重要里程碑。
    他说，我们德宏傣族景颇族自治州同缅甸的克钦邦和掸邦山水相连，村寨相望，两国边境人民一向友好相处，许多人还结为亲戚。我们德宏傣族景颇族自治州各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在工农业生产和文教卫生工作等方面都取得了辉煌的成就，目前，我们正为1960年继续跃进而努力。我们非常珍视同缅甸人民的友好关系，并将为巩固和发展这种友好关系而贡献我们的力量。王之祥最后说，中国同缅甸的边境人民过去是友好相处，今后由于中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，我们两国的边界也必然是友好的边界。
    缅甸联邦国防军第七旅旅长苏敏上校应邀在庆祝会上讲了话。他说：中缅两国历史上遗留下来的边界问题，是帝国主义给两国人民留下的灾祸，这次我们两国总理签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国边界问题协定，使我们两国之间再也不会发生意外的纠纷与摩擦，并使我们两国友好的关系得到了保证。关于这两个伟大的条约和协定，使帝国主义感到震惊，他们的心目中认为在社会制度不同的国家之间和平共处是不能巩固和持久的，我们两国签订的这两个条约和协定，为坚持实现和平共处五项原则树立了良好的榜样，也是我们两国边防部队和边境各族人民的大喜讯。苏敏上校在讲话结束时高呼：“中缅两国军队友好万岁！”“中缅友好万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长思维章（傣族）、雷春国（景颇族），腾冲驻军指挥官丁一上校以及自治州的工人、农民、青年、宗教界代表，都在庆祝大会上讲了话，他们在讲话中一致拥护中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国边界问题协定，并表示要在各个不同的岗位上，用实际行动来巩固和发展中缅两国边民之间的传统友谊。
  庆祝大会结束后，德宏傣族景颇族自治州负责人同以苏敏上校为首的缅甸朋友们合影留念。自治州副州长王之祥和我国腾冲驻军指挥官丁一上校并向缅甸朋友赠送礼品。
    晚上，王之祥副州长设宴招待苏敏上校和缅甸朋友们。宴会后举行了联欢晚会。欢乐、友好的气氛笼罩着边城芒市。
