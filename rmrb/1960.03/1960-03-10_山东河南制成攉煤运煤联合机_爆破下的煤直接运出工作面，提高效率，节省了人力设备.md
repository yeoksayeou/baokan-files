Shandong and Henan Make a Combined Coal Loading and Transporting Machine
    Coal after Blasting is Directly Transported out of the Working Face, Improving Efficiency and Saving Labor and Equipment

    (Reported by our newspaper) The workers of the Huafeng Mine under the Xinwen Mining Bureau of Shandong Province have recently successfully created a combined coal loading and transporting machine.

    The characteristic of this combined machine is: it combines the two processes of coal loading and coal transportation on the coal mining working face. After the coal is blasted down, this combined machine directly transports it out of the working face. In this way, it eliminates the need for coal loaders to load coal, and it also saves the electric scraper conveyor on the working face and the workers who maintain and use the electric scraper conveyor, creating very favorable conditions for liberating the heavy physical labor of underground coal miners, simplifying coal mining procedures, and saving equipment.

    According to calculations from the seven working faces of this mine that have fully promoted this combined machine, after using this combined machine, the output of the working face has increased by 23%, the number of coal loaders has been reduced from 589 to 141, the full-member efficiency of the working face has increased by more than doubled, and all electric scraper conveyors have been eliminated.

    The structure of this combined coal loading and material transporting machine is very simple. The average amount of steel required for each unit is less than one ton, and the cost is only one-fifth of that of an electric scraper conveyor. Ordinary mine repair factories can manufacture it.

    This combined coal loading and material transporting machine is not limited by the thickness of the coal seam, and it is especially suitable for thin coal seams where coal loading and transportation are particularly difficult. After transporting the coal out of the working face, it can also transport pit wood back to the working face, thus saving a lot of material transportation workers.

    The combined coal loading and material transporting machine created by Xinwen Huafeng Coal Mine was developed on the basis of promoting the coal loading machine of Fuxin Coal Mine. In January of this year, the mine manufactured many coal loading machines according to the drawings of Fuxin Mine, but they were not convenient to use because there were too many thin coal seams. The workers of this mine worked hard for eighteen days and nights and conducted forty-three experiments, finally successfully trial-producing the combined coal loading and material transporting machine.

    Now, various coal mines in Shandong Province are generally promoting this combined coal loading and material transporting machine. The Ministry of Coal Industry has designated the promotion of the combined coal loading and material transporting machine as one of the important measures for liberating workers from heavy physical labor in coal mines across the country this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th: The workers of Longshanmiao Coal Mine in Pingdingshan, Henan Province, have successfully trial-produced an electric combined transportation machine, making a new contribution to the comprehensive mechanization of coal mine production nationwide.

    The electric combined transportation machine replaces the coal loading machine and the transporting electric scraper conveyor. It can directly transport the fallen coal out of the working face without going through coal loading, greatly reducing the heavy physical labor of workers.

    At present, Longshanmiao Mine mostly mines thin coal seams with a thickness of about one meter. The distance between the electric scraper conveyor and the roof is only twenty centimeters, making movement very difficult. Especially when loading coal into the electric scraper conveyor, workers cannot stand to operate, and even if there is a coal loading machine, it cannot function. Workers have to shovel coal one shovel at a time to the transport machine alley.

    Based on this situation, the mine's Party committee listed how to effectively solve the coal loading and transportation problems in the thin coal seam mining working face as the main content of the current technical innovation and technical revolution. Fu Yuming, the head of the electromechanical section, first proposed the suggestion of trial-producing an electric combined transportation machine. Based on this suggestion, the Party committee quickly formed a "three-way combination" group composed of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, actively carried out research, and mobilized all the workers of the machine repair factory to participate, adopting the method of researching, manufacturing, experimenting, and improving at the same time, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally successfully trial-produced it all in just twelve days. Trial use has proved that this machine not only replaces the coal loading machine and the electric scraper conveyor transportation on the working face and saves 80% of the coal loading workers, but also the production efficiency is also about twice as high as before.

    The electric combined transportation machine also has the advantages of simple structure, easy manufacture, simple operation, light and quick movement, relatively sturdy and not easy to cause accidents. The weight of each electric combined transportation machine is only one-eighth of that of a 100-meter-long 11-type electric scraper conveyor, and the cost is only one-fifth of it, which not only helps to solve the current difficulty of insufficient supply of electric scraper conveyors, but also can save a lot of steel for the country.

    The Pingdingshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has already held an on-site meeting in Longshanmiao Mine, requesting that each coal mine quickly conduct key experiments in order to fully implement it.

### 山东河南制成攉煤运煤联合机  爆破下的煤直接运出工作面，提高效率，节省了人力设备

    山东河南制成攉煤运煤联合机
    爆破下的煤直接运出工作面，提高效率，节省了人力设备
    本报讯　山东新汶矿务局华丰矿职工，最近创制成功一种攉煤运料联合机。
    这种联合机的特点是：它把采煤工作面上的攉煤和运煤两个工序合并在一起，当煤爆破下来以后，就由这种联合机直接运出工作面。这样，既可以不用攉煤工攉煤，又可以节省工作面上的电溜子和维护、使用电溜子的工人，为解放井下采煤工人的笨重体力劳动、简化采煤工序和节省设备创造了非常有利的条件。
    据这个矿已经全面推广这种联合机的七个工作面计算，使用这种联合机以后，工作面产量提高了23％，攉煤工从五百八十九人减到一百四十一人，工作面全员效率提高一倍以上，而且全部取消了电溜子。
    这种攉煤运料联合机的构造很简单，平均每部所需的钢材不到一吨，成本只及电溜子的五分之一，普通的矿山机修厂都能制造。
    这种攉煤运料机还不受煤层厚薄的限制，对攉煤运煤特别困难的薄煤层尤其适用。它在把煤运出工作面以后，还能把坑木运回工作面去，因而还能节省很多运料工。
    新汶华丰煤矿创造的攉煤运料联合机，是在推广阜新煤矿的攉煤机基础上发展起来的。今年1月，这个矿曾按照阜新矿的图纸制造了很多攉煤机，但是因为薄煤层太多，使用不方便。这个矿的职工苦战了十八个昼夜，进行了四十三次试验，终于试制成功了攉煤运料联合机。
    现在，山东省各煤矿已在普遍推广这种攉煤运料联合机。煤炭工业部已经把推广攉煤运料联合机，定为今年全国煤矿解放工人笨重体力劳动的重要措施之一。
    据新华社郑州9日电　河南省平顶山龙山庙煤矿职工试制成功电动联合运输机，为全国煤矿生产的全面机械化作出了新的贡献。
    电动联合运输机代替了攉煤机和运输电溜子，它不经过攉煤就可以直接将落下的煤运出工作面，大大减轻了工人的笨重体力劳动。
    龙山庙矿目前大都在厚度为一米左右的薄煤层开采。电溜子和顶板之间的距离仅二十厘米，移动非常困难。尤其是往电溜子里攉煤，工人不能站着操作，有攉煤机也发挥不了作用，工人不得不一锹传一锹地把煤攉到运输机巷。
    根据这种情况，矿党委就把如何有效地解决薄煤层采煤工作面的攉煤和运输问题，列为当前进行技术革新和技术革命的主要内容。机电科长富玉明，首先提出了试制电动联合运输机的建议。党委根据这一建议，迅速组成了有领导干部、技术人员和工人参加的“三结合”小组，积极进行研究，并发动机修厂全体工人参加，采取边研究、边制造、边试验、边改进的办法，战胜了重重困难，终于在短短的十二天内全部试制成功。试用证明，这种机械不仅代替了攉煤机和工作面的电溜子运输，节省了80％的攉煤工人，而且生产效率也比以前提高两倍左右。
    电动联合运输机还具有结构简单、易于制造、操作简便、移动轻快、比较坚固和不容易发生事故等优点。每部电动联合运输机的重量，只等于百米长的一一型电溜子的八分之一，成本费用仅等于它的五分之一，既有助于解决目前电溜子供应不足的困难，又可以为国家节约大量钢铁。
    中共平顶山市委已经在龙山庙矿召开了现场会议，要求各煤矿迅速重点试验，以便全面推行。
