Our newspaper Chongqing, 4th - Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's leadership cadres at all levels, while focusing on key production issues in February, adopted a method of achieving breakthroughs in specific areas to drive overall progress, widely planting "experimental fields" to promote an all-round leap forward in production.

The characteristics of Chongqing Iron and Steel's leadership cadres planting experimental fields are: fast planting, large quantity planted, quick problem solving, and receiving immediate results in production. In just over twenty days, from the company's Party Secretary and Manager to the 529 leadership cadres of various units, 189 "experimental fields" were planted, solving 72 of the company's 91 major key problems in one fell swoop. Steel production and quality increased steadily. Among these, the daily steel production in mid-February increased by 16.11% compared to the first ten days of the month, and increased by another 2.1% in the last ten days of the month compared to the middle ten days, and the quality was also greatly improved.

Since the beginning of this year, Chongqing Iron and Steel has encountered many new difficulties in steel production. In order to improve desulfurization efficiency and steel quality, all steelmaking workshops generally changed the original acidic iron smelting furnaces to hot-blast alkaline iron smelting furnaces. However, because workers were temporarily unfamiliar with this new equipment, problems such as short furnace life and low iron melting rates often occurred. Coal gas furnaces and steam furnaces also experienced many accidents such as slagging and blockage of tuyeres due to poor quality raw coal, failing to meet the needs of steelmaking and rolling steel production. These weak links seriously affected production.

In the process of planting experimental fields, leadership cadres at all levels operated alongside workers, carefully observed problems in production, exchanged opinions with workers, analyzed causes, and proposed solutions, thus solving many key production problems in a short period. For example, the lifespan of iron smelting furnaces has generally increased from one day or more to three days or more, the iron melting rate has increased from five tons per hour to eight tons, the phenomenon of nodulation has been basically eliminated, and the gas furnace has also burned good gas from bad coal. In January, the open-hearth furnace workshop was often affected by insufficient gas supply, which affected steelmaking. This time, the workshop's general branch secretary and a branch secretary who came from a gas worker background jointly planted an experimental field at the gas furnace. In the process of operating and talking with the workers, they found that the operational thinking of the three shifts was not unified. Subsequently, they worked with the workers to develop new operating procedures, so that the gas was always maintained at around 1,300 large calories. In addition, this unit also solved key problems such as poor open-hearth furnace maintenance and tight transportation through the method of planting experimental fields. Although the furnace was in its final stage this month, the smelting time per furnace of steel was still half an hour shorter than last month, the daily output was 18% higher than last month, and the monthly plan was completed two and a half days ahead of schedule. Aiming at the key problem of the short lifespan of iron smelting furnaces, the two Party secretaries of the Zhongshan Hall converter plant went deep into the No. 2 iron smelting furnace to plant experimental fields. They found in joint operation with the workers that the main key to the short lifespan of hot-blast iron smelting furnaces was nodulation, and nodulation was due to eight reasons such as careless operation and blockage of tuyeres. Based on these reasons, various operating procedures were formulated, resulting in the lifespan of the iron smelting furnace being extended by more than one time.

After the leadership cadres went deep into the front line to plant experimental fields, they not only overcame the tendency of seeing things more than people in some cadres, but also explored a set of working methods and improved the level of management. The Liujiaba converter plant is a new plant that was put into production in September last year. Most of the workers and cadres are novices, the system is not yet sound, and even the shift handover system is very chaotic. The workers' operations are very inconsistent, so production is unstable. After this time, the leadership cadres went deep into the front line to plant experimental fields, and seriously worked with technical cadres, management cadres and workers to jointly formulate a complete set of management systems and operating procedures; they adopted the method of formulating one item and implementing one item, quickly putting production on the right track.

    深入生产关键　突破一点推动全盘
    重钢广种“试验田”
    二十多天解决80％的重大关键问题保证了高产优质
    本报重庆4日电　重庆钢铁公司各级领导干部在2月份大抓生产关键的同时，采取突破一点带动全面的方法，广种“试验田”，促进生产获得全面跃进。
    重钢各级领导干部种试验田的特点是：种得快、种得多，解决问题迅速，而且在生产上收到了立竿见影的效果。二十多天中，从公司党委书记、经理到各单位的五百二十九名领导干部种了一百八十九块“试验田”，使全公司九十一个重大关键，一下就解决了七十二个。钢产量、质量节节上升，其中2月中旬钢的日产量比上旬提高16．11％，下旬又比中旬提高2．1％，质量也大大提高。
    今年以来，重钢在钢铁生产中遇到了不少新困难。各炼钢车间为了提高脱硫效率，提高钢的质量，普遍将原来的酸性化铁炉改为热风碱性化铁炉。但是，由于工人一时不熟悉这种新设备，经常发生炉子寿命短、熔铁率低等问题，煤气炉和蒸汽炉也由于原煤质量不好，结渣、堵死风眼等事故很多，供不上炼钢和轧钢生产的需要。这些薄弱环节都严重地影响着生产。
    在种试验田的过程中，各级领导干部与工人共同操作，仔细观察生产中的问题，同工人交换意见，分析原因，提出解决办法，因而在短时期内就解决了很多生产关键问题。如化铁炉的炉龄已普遍由一天多提高到三天多，熔铁率由每小时五吨提高到八吨，基本上消除了结瘤现象，煤气炉也用坏煤烧出了好气。小平炉车间1月份常因煤气供应不上而影响炼钢，这次，车间总支书记和一个煤气工人出身的支部书记共同到煤气炉种试验田，他们在与工人共同操作、谈心的过程中，发现三班的操作思想不统一。接着，和工人共同研究定出了新的操作规程，使煤气经常保持在一千三百大卡左右。此外，这个单位还通过种试验田的方法，解决了平炉维护不好、运输紧张等关键问题。虽然这个月炉子处于末期，但每炉钢熔炼时间还是比上月缩短了半小时，日产量比上月提高了18％，而且提前两天半完成了月计划。中山堂转炉厂针对化铁炉寿命短的关键，两个党委书记深入二号化铁炉种试验田。他们和工人共同操作中发现，热风化铁炉寿命短的主要关键是由于结瘤，而结瘤又因操作马虎、塞死风眼等八个原因。根据这些原因，订出了各项操作规程，结果使化铁炉的寿命延长了一倍以上。
    领导干部深入第一线种试验田后，不仅克服了某些干部中见物多见人少的偏向，而且还摸索出了一套工作方法，提高了管理水平。刘家坝转炉厂是去年9月才投入生产的新厂，工人、干部绝大部分是新手，制度还不健全，甚至连交接班制度也很混乱，工人们的操作很不统一，因而生产不稳定。这次领导干部深入第一线种试验田后，认真同技术干部、管理干部和工人共同研究制订了一套完整的管理制度和操作规程；他们采取订一条、贯彻一条的办法，很快使生产迅速走上正规。
