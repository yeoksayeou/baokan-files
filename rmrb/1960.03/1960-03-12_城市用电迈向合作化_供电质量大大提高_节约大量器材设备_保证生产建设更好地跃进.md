City Electricity Use Moves Towards Cooperation
Power Supply Quality Greatly Improved, Saving Large Amounts of Equipment, Ensuring Better Leaps Forward in Production and Construction
Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: China's urban electricity consumption is developing in the direction of cooperation. At present, more than 30 large and medium-sized cities across the country, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Changsha, and Guangzhou, are systematically and step-by-step promoting the advanced experience of voltage boosting, simplification, and "four-in-one" ring power supply. The promotion of this advanced experience can not only thoroughly change the unreasonable state of the power distribution systems in these cities, but also dismantle a large number of electrical equipment to support the needs of new industrial areas and rural electrification.

According to statistics from nine cities in Liaoning Province, including Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, and Andong, which have already begun to partially promote the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience, to date, 931 transformers, totaling more than 50,000 kVA, more than 240,000 meters of various wires and cables, and more than 260 switchboards have been dismantled from the old power distribution systems. If this equipment is used for agriculture, it can provide electric irrigation for 5 million mu of land. In Beijing, the results of trial ring power supply in four factories and three districts showed that not only was the potential of a large number of electrical equipment tapped, but also the power supply quality was greatly improved due to the universal increase in voltage and the implementation of ring power supply. Many factories are no longer affected by low voltage and insufficient power supply equipment, the transmission capacity of lines has been generally improved, power outages have been reduced, and a lot of reactive power has also been reduced. In the past, cities such as Changsha and Zhuzhou in Hunan Province were unable to keep up with the rapid development of new industries and their power supply equipment, which partially affected the normal production of some factories; after the implementation of the "four-in-one" ring power supply, the existing equipment can not only meet the needs of industrial electricity consumption, but also allocate a portion to support nearby rural areas.

In Heilongjiang Province, the birthplace of the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience, this experience has now been fully promoted. In Harbin, 72 power supply areas have basically implemented the "four-in-one" ring power supply, and 30,000 kVA of transformers alone have been dismantled. The phenomenon of power poles standing in forests and lines as dense as spider webs on the main streets in the past has now been swept away. Some places have even become streets without power poles, further beautifying the city's appearance.

Simplification, voltage boosting, and ring power supply were first created by the Hongqi Chemical Plant in Heilongjiang Province. In the past, this plant lacked planning for the layout of the power distribution system, and the power transmission lines in the plant were very chaotic, and the utilization rate of electrical equipment was not high; however, on the other hand, due to the rapid development of production, there was a serious shortage of power supply equipment, lack of power supply, low voltage quality, frequent motor burnout and unsafe production. In response to this situation, the factory's employees creatively integrated the advanced experiences of various places in reforming the power distribution system and carried out a thorough reform within the factory. They appropriately increased the voltage of some lines, canceled the radial power supply mode with workshops as units, and replaced it with a ring power supply in which each unit was connected to support each other. At the same time, they also merged low-voltage power and lighting power into mixed power. After this reform, the plant's power distribution equipment and transmission lines were greatly reduced, the utilization rate of electrical equipment was increased, the line power supply capacity was increased, and the voltage quality was improved and the consumption of reactive power was reduced, ensuring safe production. Subsequently, the Harbin Wire Factory further developed the chemical plant's experience. They not only reformed within the factory, but also cooperated with nearby factories, institutions, schools, and residents to build a "four-in-one" (factory internal electricity integration, factory and factory electricity integration, industrial and civil electricity integration, factory power grid and regional power grid integration) ring power supply network. In this way, the advantages of simplification, voltage boosting, and ring power supply were further developed, the boundaries of electricity consumption by individual households were broken, communist collaboration was promoted, and a systematically complete experience was created for thoroughly changing the unreasonable phenomenon of the power distribution system.

After this experience appeared, it quickly received attention from relevant departments across the country. After receiving the news, many units immediately sent people to Harbin to visit and learn. Beijing, Tianjin, Changsha, Jinan, Liaoning and other provinces and cities also established organizations for the reform of the power distribution system, conducted investigations on the power distribution system of the entire province and city, and formulated plans for gradual reform. In the process of reform, various places also adopted the method of launching a mass movement, with power supply and power consumption units working together and supporting each other, so the progress was fast and the quality was good. Many power supply areas completed the overall reform plan in just two or three days.

In the specific application of simplification, voltage boosting, and the "four-in-one" ring power supply, there have been many new developments in various places. On the basis of "four-in-one," Tianjin, Changsha and other places have added new contents of spare parts integration and maintenance technician integration, further expanding the scope of cooperation.

### 城市用电迈向合作化  供电质量大大提高　节约大量器材设备　保证生产建设更好地跃进

    三十多个城市推广哈尔滨先进经验　彻底改变配电系统不合理状况
    城市用电迈向合作化
    供电质量大大提高　节约大量器材设备　保证生产建设更好地跃进
    新华社11日讯　我国城市用电正在向合作化方向发展。目前，全国已有北京、天津、沈阳、济南、长沙、广州等三十多个大中城市，正在有计划有步骤地推广升压、简化、四合一环形供电的先进经验。通过这一先进经验的推广，不仅可以彻底改变这些城市配电系统的不合理的状况，而且还能拆下大批电气器材支援新工业区和农村电气化的需要。
    据已经开始部分推广四合一环形供电经验的辽宁省沈阳、旅大、抚顺、安东等九个城市的统计，到目前为止，已从旧的配电系统上拆下变压器九百三十一台，共五万多千伏安，各种电线电缆二十四万多米，配电盘二百六十多副。这些器材如果用于农业，可供五百万亩土地实行电力灌溉。北京市在四个工厂和三个地区试行环行供电的结果，不但挖出了大批电气设备的潜力，而且由于普遍升高了电压和实行环行供电，供电质量大大提高。许多工厂不再因为电压低，供电设备不足而影响生产，线路的输电能力普遍提高，停电事故减少，还减少了很多无功电力。湖南省长沙、株洲等城市过去因为新工业发展很快，供电设备跟不上，部分影响了某些工厂的正常生产；实行四合一环形供电以后，现有设备器材不仅可以满足工业用电的需要，还能拨出一部分支援附近农村。
    在四合一环行供电经验的发源地——黑龙江省，现在已全面推广了这一经验。哈尔滨市已有七十二个供电区域基本上实行了四合一环形供电，仅变压器就拆下了三万千伏安。过去各主要街道上电杆林立、线路密如蛛网的现象，现在已经一扫而光，有的地方还变成了无电柱街道，进一步美化了城市的市容。
    简化、升压、环形供电，是由黑龙江省红旗化工厂首创的。这个厂过去因为对配电系统的布置缺乏规划，厂内送电线路十分紊乱，电气设备的利用率不高；但是另一方面，由于生产的迅速发展，又出现供电设备严重不足，电源缺乏，电压质量低，电动机常被烧毁和生产不安全等现象。针对这种情况，这个厂职工创造性地综合采用了各地在改革配电系统中的各项先进经验，在工厂内部进行了彻底改革。他们把一部分线路的电压适当升高，取消了以车间为单位的辐射形供电方式，代之以各单位联结在一起可以互相支援的环形供电，同时还把低压动力用电和照明用电合并起来，变成混合用电。经过这样改革以后，全厂的配电设备和送电线路大大减少，电气设备的利用率提高，线路供电能力增加，还改善了电压质量和减少了无功电力的消耗，保证了安全生产。接着，哈尔滨电线厂又进一步发展了化工厂的经验。他们不仅在厂内改革，而且还同附近的工厂、机关、学校、居民协作，建成了“四合一”（工厂内部用电合一，工厂与工厂用电合一，工业和民用电合一，厂用电网和地区电网合一）的环形供电网。这样，就进一步发扬了简化、升压、环形供电的优点，打破了一家一户用电的界限，促进了共产主义大协作，为彻底改变配电系统的不合理现象创造了系统完整的经验。
    这一经验出现以后，很快受到全国各地有关部门的重视。许多单位在得到消息以后，立刻派人到哈尔滨去参观学习。北京、天津、长沙、济南、辽宁等省市还专门成立了配电系统改革的组织，对全省、全市的配电系统进行了调查，并且订出了逐步改革的规划。在改革过程中，各地又采取了大搞群众运动的方式，供电、用电单位一起动手、互相支援，因而进度快、质量好。很多供电区域，只花了两三天的时间，就完成了全面改革计划。
    在具体运用简化、升压四合一环形供电的过程中，各地又有很多新的发展。天津、长沙等地在四合一的基础上，又增加了备品备件合一、维修技工合一的新内容，进一步扩大了协作的范围。
