    The Earth is Changing
    Since the Earth formed four or five billion years ago until now, its internal physical and chemical processes have never ceased. These processes are very complex, and there are still many areas we do not understand. The fission of some radioactive elements inside the Earth generates enormous energy. According to Soviet scientists, the fission of atomic elements inside the Earth adds 43 quadrillion kilocalories of heat to the Earth's core every hour. The energy generated by compression and expansion processes is even greater than this. The crystallization of some rocks may also release or absorb energy, and their volume may increase or decrease. These are the causes of earthquakes.
    The Earth's crust is not as calm as we usually see it. It is changing both vertically and horizontally. The ground in vast areas of the Scandinavian Peninsula is currently rising gradually, about one meter every hundred years. At the same time, some parts of France are slowly sinking. If carefully measured, the distance between Greenland and the European continent changes by 30 meters every year. And the distance between Europe and America changed by 4.5 meters in the seven years from 1926 to 1933. Every location on Earth is changing. If new mountain ridges are not continuously growing on the Earth, then after only one million years, wind, water, and the sun could make the Earth's surface as smooth as a marble. (Yu Wen)

    地球在变动
    自从地球在四、五十亿年以前形成一直到现在，它内部的物理化学过程从来没有间断过。这种过程非常复杂，目前我们还有许多地方没有了解。地球内部一些放射性元素的裂变能产生巨大的能量。据苏联科学家计算，由于地球内部元素原子的裂变，每小时要给地球核心增加四千三百万亿千卡的热量。由于压缩和膨胀过程所产生的能量还要比这个大。一些岩石结晶的过程也可能放出或吸收能量，而它们的体积也可能增大或缩小。这些都是发生地震的原因。
    地球的外壳并不像我们平时所看到的那样平静。它无论在垂直方向和水平方向都在变动。斯堪的纳维亚半岛广大地区的地面目前正在逐渐上升，每一百年要上升一米左右。同时，法国的一些地方都在缓缓下沉。格陵兰和欧洲大陆之间的距离如果仔细测量，每年要变动三十米。而欧洲和美洲之间的距离从1926年到1933年的七年中，就发生了四点五米的变动。地球上的任何地点都在发生变动。倘使地球上不陆续生长新的山脊，那么，只要经过一百万年，风、水和太阳就能把地球表面弄得像弹子那样光滑。（宇文）
