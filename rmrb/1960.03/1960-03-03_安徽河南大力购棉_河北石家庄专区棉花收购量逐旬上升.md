Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 2nd: In Anhui Province, Party committee secretaries at all levels are taking the lead to strengthen leadership over the later stages of cotton purchasing. Some key cotton-producing counties have established cotton purchasing and re-purchasing offices. Cadres have been dispatched to various locations to assist in cotton purchasing. Wuhu Prefecture has transferred a group of cadres from directly affiliated organizations to eleven key cotton-producing communes in six cotton-producing counties to help arrange labor and re-purchase and sell cotton.

Since the Spring Festival, people's communes throughout the province have continued to enthusiastically sell cotton. As of now, eleven counties and cities, including Wuwei, Feixi, and Anqing, have overfulfilled the 1959-1960 cotton purchasing plan. Many communes are organizing labor to re-harvest cotton in order to sell more cotton to the state. Recently, the Liuzhou People's Commune in Wuwei County improved commune members' enthusiasm for selling cotton through the method of "two accounts" (calculating the account of selling cotton to support national construction and calculating the account of increasing commune members' income). Production teams have launched a concentrated effort to pick up fallen cotton and harvest cotton remaining on stalks, selling a total of more than 267,000 catties of cotton, of which more than 70,000 catties were re-harvested fallen cotton and undeveloped bolls.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 2nd: In Henan Province, various regions are vigorously purchasing cotton in conjunction with organizing the masses to fight drought and irrigate wheat. Party committees at all levels throughout the province have made unified arrangements for cotton purchasing while assigning drought resistance tasks. Commercial departments have strengthened their purchasing force, generally increased purchasing points, and promoted the practice of simultaneously purchasing and supplying drought resistance materials, which has been welcomed by the masses. In early February, the average daily cotton purchase volume in Xinxiang Prefecture increased by 4.1 times compared to late January.

People's communes are very enthusiastic about selling cotton. Recently, communes in Hua County have found a large amount of cotton to sell to the state by cleaning warehouses, clearing scattered cotton stores, and carrying out secondary harvesting of incompletely harvested cotton stalks. At present, communes in this county have used the income from selling cotton to purchase 253 waterwheels and 18 gas engines for drought resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd: In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, the volume of cotton purchased in February increased with each ten-day period. The average daily purchase volume in the last ten days of the month increased by 47% compared to the first ten days.

Since entering February, the Party committees of the Shijiazhuang Prefecture, counties, and communes have strengthened leadership over the later stages of cotton purchasing. The First Secretaries are taking the lead, with some Party committee secretaries, commissioners, and county heads going deep into key cotton-producing areas to help commune and team cadres comprehensively arrange production, life, and cotton purchasing work. Wu Shuanglin, Deputy Commissioner of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, went to the Yehe Commune in Gaocheng County. On the one hand, he helped commune cadres promote the significance of selling more cotton to support national socialist construction by calculating the harvest account and arranging the masses' lives. On the other hand, he helped local commercial departments adopt measures that facilitated the masses, such as on-site purchasing and cash-for-goods transactions, and quickly overfulfilled the cotton sales plan.

In the purchasing process, various regions have adopted methods of grasping advanced units, leading the general, establishing models, and commending model workers, which has played a significant role in encouraging commune members to actively sell cotton.

    安徽河南大力购棉
    河北石家庄专区棉花收购量逐旬上升
    新华社合肥2日电　安徽省各级党委书记挂帅，加强对后期棉花收购工作的领导。一些重点产棉县成立了棉花收购、复收办公室。各地都派出干部帮助收购棉花。芜湖专区从直属机关抽调了一批干部，分别到六个产棉县的十一个重点产棉公社，帮助安排劳动力和复收、出售棉花。
    全省各地人民公社在春节以后继续踊跃售棉。现在已有无为、肥西、安庆等十一个县、市超额完成了1959至1960年度的棉花收购计划。许多公社组织劳动力，进行棉花的复收工作，以便把更多的棉花卖给国家。无为县六洲人民公社最近通过“两算账”（算出售棉花支援国家建设账，算社员增加收入账）的办法，提高了社员出售棉花的积极性。各生产队突击拣拾落地棉，摘净秸上棉，共出售棉花二十六万七千多斤，其中有七万多斤是复收的落地棉和僵瓣棉。
    新华社郑州2日电　河南省各地正在结合组织群众抗旱浇麦，大力收购棉花。全省各级党委在布置抗旱任务时，都对棉花收购工作作了统一安排。商业部门加强了收购力量，普遍增设收购点，推行边收购边供应抗旱物资，受到群众的欢迎。新乡专区2月上旬平均每天收购的棉花比1月下旬上升四点一倍。
    各人民公社售棉很踊跃。滑县各人民公社最近通过清理仓库、清理分散存棉、对收摘不净的花柴进行二次收摘等办法，又找出了大批棉花卖给国家。目前，这个县的公社已用售棉的收入购买了水车二百五十三部、煤气机十八部，用于抗旱。
    新华社天津2日电　河北省石家庄专区2月份棉花收购量逐旬上升。下旬平均日收购量比上旬增加47％。
    石家庄专区进入2月份以来，专区、各县和公社党委都加强了后期棉花收购工作的领导。由第一书记挂帅，一部分党委书记、专员、县长深入重点产棉区，帮助社队干部全面安排生产、生活和收购棉花工作。石家庄专区副专员吴双霖到藁城冶河公社，一面帮助社干部通过算丰收账和安排群众生活，向社员宣传多卖棉花支援国家社会主义建设的意义；一面帮助当地商业部门采取就地收购、钱货两清等便利群众的措施，很快就超额完成了售棉计划。
    各地在收购中，采取抓先进，带一般，树立标兵，表扬模范的方法，对鼓舞社员积极售棉起了很大作用。
