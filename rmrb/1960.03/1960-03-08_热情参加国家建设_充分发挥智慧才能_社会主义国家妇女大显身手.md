Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Today marks the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. It is exciting to see that women in the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, are working with high enthusiasm to accelerate socialist and communist construction, and have achieved remarkable achievements.

Women in socialist countries are an important force in building socialism and communism. In the industrial sectors of these countries, women workers occupy an important position. In the Soviet Union's industrial sector, women workers account for 47% of the total number of workers; in North Korea, women workers account for 32.3%; in North Vietnam, women workers account for 30%; in Mongolia, women workers account for 41%; in Poland, women workers account for 33%; in Czechoslovakia, women workers account for 40%; in the German Democratic Republic, women workers account for 43%; in Bulgaria, women workers account for 30%; and in Albania, women workers account for 24.7%.

The vast number of rural women in socialist countries actively participate in agricultural production and construction. In North Vietnam, women account for 60% of agricultural cooperative members. In Mongolia, women cooperative members account for 50%. In Czechoslovakia, women account for 54% of agricultural laborers. On Bulgaria's agricultural front, 52% of producers are women. In the Soviet Union, North Korea, Albania, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Romania, women also occupy an important position on the agricultural front. Many women serve as tractor drivers, combine harvester operators, and rural leaders, such as production team leaders, collective farm chairpersons, and production cooperative directors.

Because women in socialist countries enjoy truly equal rights with men, they have the opportunity to quickly master various cultures and technologies and fully display their infinite wisdom and talents. In the Soviet Union, 50% of leaders and experts in the national economy are women. As women's education and cultural levels improve, they play an important role in cultural, educational, scientific, and medical and health work. In the Soviet Union, women teachers account for 70% of the total number of teachers; in Bulgaria, women teachers account for 61% of the total number of teachers; and in Hungary, women teachers account for 70% of the total number of teachers. Women working in the Soviet health sector account for 85% of medical personnel. Women scientific workers account for 36% of the total number of scientific workers. Among these women scientific workers, there are 662 academicians, corresponding academicians, and professors who have climbed the peaks of science and technology. Lidia Kurnosova, a famous Soviet female scientist, participated in the creation of the first artificial satellite. In Czechoslovakia, women account for 75% of the staff in the health care sector.

In the thriving upsurge of economic construction in socialist countries, women's enthusiasm for labor has greatly increased. They have launched a lively labor competition in various production posts, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, doing everything possible to tap production potential and improve labor productivity. Many women work selflessly and without regard to compensation, demonstrating a noble communist style. The Soviet advanced female worker Gaganova initiated a movement to help the backward, which had a huge impact. Yulia Vicherova, a Soviet textile worker, has already reached the production target for 1965—the last year of the Seven-Year Plan—in the competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Valentina Belova, an advanced Soviet pig breeder, created the miracle of raising 1,500 pigs a year. In 1960, she decided to raise 2,800 pigs. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, many women are ahead of schedule, completing the first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961) three and a half years or three years ahead of schedule. Pyongyang textile worker and labor hero Zhu Bingshan managed 35 looms alone and was the first to complete the first Five-Year Plan in early 1958. In the mass movement to manage multiple machines launched last year, she increased from managing 35 machines to 55 machines, greatly improving labor productivity. Bulgarian women workers also demonstrated heroic spirit in their work. Ostrova, a female worker at the "Maritsa" textile factory in Plovdiv and a Socialist Labor Hero, has already started producing products for 1980. In the German Democratic Republic, millions of female employees participated in the socialist labor competition. Richta, a female worker at the Zittau textile factory, put forward the initiative of advanced helping backward last year and became a banner in the socialist competition.

Female advanced producers and model figures in socialist countries have received universal respect from the people and praise from the state. According to statistics, 835,000 women in the Soviet Union have won medals and orders, 2,605 women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, 75 women have been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and many women have been awarded the title of "Communist Labor Shock Worker." In Albania, more than 1,300 women have won the title of Stakhanovite worker, and more than 3,300 women have won various medals and awards.

    热情参加国家建设　充分发挥智慧才能
    社会主义国家妇女大显身手
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：今天是“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年纪念日。人们兴奋地看到，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的妇女，以高涨的热情为加速社会主义和共产主义建设而努力，并且取得了卓越的成就。
    社会主义各国妇女是建设社会主义和共产主义的一支重要力量。在这些国家的工业部门中，女工占着重要的地位。在苏联的工业部门中，女工占工人总数的47％，朝鲜女工占32．3％，越南北方女工占30％，蒙古的女工占41％，波兰女工占33％，捷克斯洛伐克女工占40％，德意志民主共和国女工占43％，保加利亚女工占30％，阿尔巴尼亚女工占24．7％。
    社会主义国家的广大农村妇女积极参加农业生产建设。在越南北方农业社员中，妇女占60％。蒙古女社员占50％。在捷克斯洛伐克，妇女占农业劳动者的54％。在保加利亚的农业战线上，52％的生产者是妇女。在苏联、朝鲜、阿尔巴尼亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰和罗马尼亚，妇女在农业战线上也占重要地位。许多妇女担任了拖拉机手、收获联合机手以及农村中的领导工作，如生产队长、集体农庄主席、生产合作社社长等。
    由于社会主义国家的妇女享有和男子真正平等的权利，她们就能够有机会迅速地掌握各种文化和技术，充分地发挥她们无穷无尽的智慧和才能。在苏联，国民经济部门中50％的领导人和专家都是妇女，由于妇女的教育和文化水平提高，她们在文教、科学和医药卫生工作方面发挥着重要的作用。在苏联，女教师占教师总数的70％；在保加利亚，女教师占教师总数的61％；匈牙利女教师占教师总数的70％。苏联在卫生工作部门工作的妇女占医务工作人员的85％。女科学工作者占科学工作人员总数的36％，在这些女科学工作者中间，有院士、通讯院士、教授六百六十二人，她们攀登了科学技术的高峰。苏联著名的女科学家丽佳·库尔诺索娃参加了第一批人造卫星的制造工作。在捷克斯洛伐克，妇女占卫生保健部门工作人员的75％。
    社会主义各国妇女在蓬勃发展的经济建设高潮中，劳动积极性大大提高了，她们在各种生产岗位上掀起了热火朝天的劳动竞赛，大搞技术革新和技术革命，千方百计地发掘生产潜力，提高劳动生产率。许多妇女在工作中不计报酬，忘我劳动，发扬了崇高的共产主义风格。苏联先进女工加干诺娃倡议掀起了先进帮助落后的运动，产生了巨大的影响。苏联纺织女工尤丽娅·维切洛娃在提前完成七年计划的竞赛中已经达到了1965年——七年计划最后一年的生产指标。苏联先进养猪员瓦莲金娜·别洛娃创造了一年喂养一千五百头猪的奇迹，1960年她决定喂养二千八百头猪。在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，很多妇女都走在时间的前面，提前三年半或三年完成了第一个五年计划（1957年—1961年）。平壤纺织女工、劳动英雄朱炳善一人看管三十五台织布机，在1958年初第一个完成了第一个五年计划。在去年开展的群众性看管多台运动中，她又从看管三十五台增加到五十五台，大大提高了劳动生产率。保加利亚女工在劳动中也表现了英雄的气概。普罗夫迪夫市“马里查”纺织厂女工、社会主义劳动英雄奥斯特洛娃已开始生产1980年的产品。在德意志民主共和国，成百万女职工参加了社会主义劳动竞赛，齐涛纺织厂女工里希特在去年提出了先进帮助后进的倡议，成为社会主义竞赛中的旗帜。
    社会主义国家的女先进生产者和模范人物受到了人民的普遍尊敬和国家的褒奖。据统计，苏联有八十三万五千名妇女荣获奖章和勋章，二千六百零五名妇女获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号，有七十五名妇女荣获苏联英雄的称号，许许多多妇女获得了“共产主义劳动突击手”的称号。在阿尔巴尼亚，仅荣获斯塔哈诺夫工作者称号的妇女就有一千三百多人，获得了各种勋章和奖章的妇女有三千三百多人。
