Strengthening the Agricultural Front is the Current Primary Task

    Strengthening the agricultural front by every possible means is the central link in developing the socialist economy at high speed and proportionally, and therefore is the primary task of the party organizations and all the people of Shaanxi Province.

    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Only by realizing agricultural modernization and developing agricultural production at high speed can we solve the major problem of food and clothing for all the people, continuously expand the supply of industrial raw materials and sources of capital accumulation, and gradually free up a large amount of labor for the development of industry; and only then can we further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance on the basis of modern technology. Our party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached importance to agricultural issues. During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Central Committee further established the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, adding new content to Marxist-Leninist political economics. Like all parts of the country, the party organizations and the broad masses of people in Shaanxi Province have resolutely implemented this correct policy of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. It is precisely because of this that our agricultural front has been able to continuously achieve great successes and promote the overall leap forward of industry and other undertakings with the great leap forward in agriculture. In 1958, the province's agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest; in 1959, although it suffered from a hundred-day drought that had not been seen for decades, the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries still increased by more than 12% compared with the great leap forward of 1958, and by about 50% compared with 1957. Compared with 1949, although the area of cultivated land has decreased somewhat, grain output has increased by nearly doubled, and cotton has increased by two times. In 1959, the province's total industrial output value increased by 48% compared with 1958, and by one and a half times compared with 1957, and exceeded the total agricultural output value; not only has light industry made great development, but also a base for the iron and steel industry has been established, and there are more mechanical manufacturing industries. The total value of commodity purchases in 1957 increased by more than 66% compared with 1958, and the total value of commodity supply increased by 40.8% compared with 1958; the total national income for the year increased by more than 16% compared with 1958. Other economic and cultural undertakings have also made great development. The above-mentioned achievements in various aspects were all achieved on the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture. Without the leap forward in agriculture, the development of other undertakings would be unimaginable.

    Since we have always attached importance to agriculture, and the situation on the agricultural front is extremely good, why should we propose the issue of strengthening the agricultural front? This is because the greater leap forward of industry and the continuous improvement of people's lives require the agricultural front to provide more grain, non-staple foods, and industrial raw materials, and to transfer more labor. However, the existing level of agricultural production cannot meet this requirement. Agricultural cultivation in Shaanxi Province still mainly uses manual tools and animal-powered tools, and labor productivity is still very low; natural disasters such as drought, soil erosion, wind and sand, hail, and diseases and pests have not been fundamentally controlled. The agricultural output of Shaanxi Province is not as high as that of advanced regions, and there is a lack of grain reserves. Under such circumstances, in order to accelerate the realization of the modernization of industry, the modernization of national defense, and the modernization of science and culture, and to promote the greater, better, and more comprehensive sustained leap forward of the entire national economy, it is necessary to put agriculture in the primary position and accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization. At the same time, if the conditions for realizing agricultural modernization in the past were not sufficient, then today, these conditions are relatively mature. The establishment of the socialist industrialization foundation and the continuous strengthening of industrial support for agriculture have provided material and technical conditions for agricultural modernization; the great agricultural harvest of 1958 and the continued leap forward of 1959 have opened up a situation for the sustained leap forward of agriculture and accumulated rich experience; and the establishment and sound development of the people's communes have further liberated agricultural productive forces and become the most important lever for realizing agricultural modernization and promoting the overall leap forward of the national economy. With these favorable conditions, we can more powerfully strengthen the agricultural front and accelerate the development of agriculture.

    Perhaps some people think that strengthening the agricultural front means that the industrial front and other fronts are not as important as in the past, and they can take a breather. The fact is just the opposite. Rapidly developing agriculture is not incompatible with giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and the greater leap forward in agriculture is not incompatible with the overall leap forward in the national economy, but they are mutually conditional and mutually promoting. Strengthening agriculture is to promote the overall leap forward of industry and even the entire national economy, and the accelerated development of agriculture requires the vigorous support of industry and other undertakings. Therefore, the issue of strengthening the agricultural front will never weaken the position and role of industry and other undertakings. On the contrary, it increases the tasks of all departments and requires all departments to strengthen their own work to meet the needs of accelerating agricultural development. In 1959, Shaanxi Province adopted the method of integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation to quickly solve market problems and promote the overall development of the national economy. This experience shows that the larger the scale of socialist construction and the faster the speed, the more the high concentration and comprehensive development of various economic departments are required. The view that various undertakings are isolated from each other and hinder each other is obviously wrong.

    Strengthening the agricultural front means achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production. 1960 is the beginning of a new stage in realizing agricultural modernization. If this year's work is done well, it will lay the foundation and create conditions for the work in the last two years of the second five-year plan and the next few years. We must seize this crucial year, try every possible means, and win a great harvest for the first crop of grain this year. On this basis, we will complete and over fulfill the annual agricultural production plan and create a good start for strengthening the agricultural front.

    Grasp Water, Fertilizer, and Management, Transform Low Yields into High Yields

    Although Shaanxi Province's agricultural production has achieved great harvests for two consecutive years, the output of about one-third of the province's cultivated land is still very low; and the general areas are not as high-yielding as the advanced areas in the country. In order to realize the requirement of accelerating agricultural development, in addition to appropriately expanding the area of cultivated land, the most important task is to transform low yields into high yields, and to ensure that the output of all areas can steadily increase.

    Whether it is possible to transform low yields into high yields has already been answered by the facts. The Yulin Special Zone has adopted comprehensive measures such as diverting water to pull sand, flushing sand to create land, diverting floodwater to irrigate land, and planting trees, planting grass, and applying fertilizer to transform more than 4.8 million mu of sandy land. The original vast desert sand has become "the beach is full of cattle and sheep, the sand sea raises fish, the little Jiangnan on the frontier, and the rice is fragrant in August." Some of the improved sandy fields have an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu, greatly exceeding the production level of low-yield areas. A prominent example is the Huayuangou Production Team of the Guidebao Commune in Yulin County, whose average yield in 1958 and 1959 was more than 1,500 jin per mu, establishing a red flag of continuous high yield in the wind and sand area. Zhouzhi County has adopted methods such as releasing silt to suppress alkali and building terrace fields to plant rice to improve more than 45,000 mu of saline-alkali land, of which the average yield of 27,000 mu has increased from 35 jin to 343 jin, an increase of more than nine times. Since these places can do it, places with the same or even better conditions can certainly do it.

    In order to transform low yields into high yields, it is necessary to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, especially to focus on the key technical measures of water, fertilizer, and management.

    There are three major enemies in agricultural production in Shaanxi Province: drought, soil erosion, and wind and sand. In order to control drought, it is necessary to vigorously develop water conservancy; in order to control mountains, it is necessary to vigorously develop soil and water conservation; in order to control sand, it is necessary to divert water into the sand and use water to pull sand. In short, water control is the most important measure to overcome natural disasters and change the face of agricultural production in Shaanxi Province, and it must be grasped firmly. Water control requires both overall planning and a focus on key points. It is necessary to vigorously develop water conservancy and prevent water disasters. We demand that in about ten years, we will manage the five rivers and two rivers (namely: Wuding River, Yan River, Luo River, Jing River, Wei River, Dan River, and Han River), control soil erosion, achieve no mountain without green, all water clear, plains with river networks, mountains and plateaus with terrace fields, farmland with water conservancy, no disasters in heavy rain, and a guaranteed harvest without rain. The current focus of water control is to advance to the plateau, mountainside, desert and grassland, adopting various methods such as diverting water to the mountains, diverting water into the sand, and draining water to wash alkali to vigorously transform low-yielding fields; at the same time, in the existing irrigation areas, further utilize water resources to achieve high-standard water conservancy. In water conservancy construction, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of storing water as the main focus, combining large, medium, and small projects, and grasping surface water and groundwater together; and combining construction, management, and utilization to fully utilize the irrigation benefits of all water conservancy facilities, overcome the phenomenon of not using water, using large amounts of water for small purposes, and using long water for short periods, and strive to repair one mu, complete one mu, repair one section, divert one section, and use one section, like the Tongchuan Fuping Commune.

    Fertilizer is the food of plants and another basic factor in transforming low yields into high yields. To solve the fertilizer problem, it is necessary to take pig raising as the center and implement the policy of raising pigs, accumulating fertilizer, planting green manure, and producing chemical fertilizer simultaneously. Raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer has a very significant effect on increasing agricultural output. The Xiaoma Production Team of the Pujie Commune in Xingping County has seen a sharp increase in the number of live pigs by twenty times in the past year or so, which has increased the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields by two times, and increased wheat production by nearly doubled. Raising pigs can not only accumulate fertilizer, but also pork is an important non-staple food, and pig bristles and pig hair are important industrial raw materials, and pig offal can be used to make medicine. As the masses say, one increase can turn into five increases—more pigs, more fertilizer, more grain, more accumulation, and more income. Shaanxi Province must launch a pig-raising movement widely and deeply throughout the province, mobilizing all walks of life to raise pigs. Raising pigs must first solve the problems of pig sources and feed. To this end, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, carry out a full retention, full mating, full pregnancy, full production, and full survival movement, and promote the method of multiple mating, continuous mating, and hot mating to maximize the number of piglets produced by sows; it is necessary to establish feed bases, develop feed production, and collect and store various wild feeds in large quantities and make extensive use of by-products of various crops. Raising pigs also requires vigorous strengthening of feeding management, especially to focus on preventing epidemics, and to ensure that all veterinarians or feeders in the people's communes learn the acupuncture treatment for swine fever technology of Fan Yuqi and Xiong Deyou of Sanyuan County to minimize the mortality rate of pigs. Collecting and accumulating fertilizer must be combined with sanitation and epidemic prevention work on a regular basis, and on the basis of regular work, conduct several national fertilizer accumulation and pest control campaigns every year. At the same time, people's communes should set up small chemical fertilizer factories and pesticide factories as much as possible, adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods for production, and focus on green manure.

    In the entire cultivation process, field management has the most amount of work, with work to be done almost every day of the year. We must seize this link, implement intensive cultivation, and pay attention to the continuous innovation of cultivation methods. All parts of the province have rich experience in this regard. For example, Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting technology, Liu Shuxian's wheat cultivation technology, and Wang Baojing's experience in comprehensively innovating cultivation technology all have significant yield-increasing effects and should be further and effectively promoted throughout the province. The broad-row intercropping cropping system created by the Fenghuo Commune has proposed a new direction for improving land utilization and should be tested on a larger scale. Stripe rust is very harmful to wheat production in Shaanxi Province. According to predictions, stripe rust in the Guanzhong area this year will have a larger epidemic. We must not be paralyzed and negligent. If rust disease is not eliminated, prevention and control will not stop.

    Large-area high-yield plots are an effective method of comprehensively adopting various yield-increasing measures and promoting the overall high yield of multiple crops, and is a major reform of the cropping system. All localities should set aside about one-third of the cultivated land to engage in high-yield plots in a big way. All high-yield plots should establish command fields and field archives, implement a three-way combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses, ensure that political, technical, and organizational measures are in place, give priority to realizing water conservancy and garden-like management, give priority to realizing technological innovation, and guarantee high yields, so as to drive a bumper harvest in all farmland through high-yield plots.

    Taking Tool Reform and Semi-Mechanization as the Center, Continuously Improving Agricultural Labor Productivity

    The fundamental way to improve agricultural labor productivity is to realize agricultural mechanization. Only by realizing agricultural mechanization can the production level of agriculture further adapt to the high-speed development of industry, and can a large amount of labor be freed up to support the industrial front and other fronts. However, the strength of industrial support for agriculture is gradually increasing, and agricultural mechanization must also go through a process from indigenous to foreign and from low to high to gradually realize it. Therefore, we must adopt a positive attitude to speed up the mechanization as much as possible, and oppose the idea of ​​liking "foreign" and disliking "indigenous" and waiting for large machines. During the second five-year plan period, we will focus on tool reform and semi-mechanization, and at the same time select some densely populated, conveniently located, and highly commercialized areas to concentrate on the use of agricultural machinery, implement partial mechanization, cultivate typical cases, accumulate experience, and train cadres to prepare conditions for the realization of comprehensive mechanization.

    The current focus of tool reform should be placed on the six major categories of tools that are laborious, high-intensity, versatile, and effective: cultivation, water conservancy, transportation, processing, pig raising, and cooking. We must grasp it firmly and reform it in sets. Not only should the six major categories of tools be matched with each other, but the reform of each tool should also be in sets. Many places have created good experience in this regard. For example, more than 140 water conservancy construction sites in the Hanzhong Special Zone have comprehensively reformed water conservancy construction tools from digging, transporting, to loading, unloading and ramming, greatly improving work efficiency. The Liquan Directly Subordinate Grain Depot of the Qian County Grain Bureau has comprehensively realized indigenous mechanization in grain receiving, transfer, storage and safekeeping. From February of last year to January of this year, it saved nearly 20,000 labor days, more than 3,000 head of livestock, saved more than 70,000 yuan of funds, and reduced grain loss by more than 50,000 jin. These experiences should be promoted throughout the province. In the tool reform, we must also pay attention to the comprehensive utilization of tools, and try to adopt hydraulic machinery as much as possible, striving to make one thing multi-purpose, so that it is less laborious, costs less money, and has greater benefits.

    Shaanxi Province has a more complex natural situation and has a fine tradition of intensive cultivation. The agricultural tool reform and mechanization must adapt to this situation and combine with the special requirements of natural conditions and cultivation techniques. For example, how to realize mechanization in mountainous areas and paddy fields, how to adapt field operation tools and intercropping, how to adapt harvesting tools to the characteristics of high density and strong plants of wheat in the Guanzhong area, etc., must be specifically studied and gradually resolved. Whether it is the reform of existing tools or the adoption of new machines, it must be carefully studied and tested before being actively and systematically promoted. We cannot only create without paying attention to promotion, nor should we rush into action without considering the conditions.

    While engaging in tool reform and semi-mechanization in a big way, we must also pay attention to the rational layout of production and the rational arrangement of labor. A rational layout can reduce the round-trip transfer of agricultural products and other materials, reduce many unnecessary labor consumption, and greatly improve labor productivity. For example, Chang'an County established field production points, selected suitable locations in the field under the principle of saving land to set up yards, drill wells, build pig pens, and build warehouses, and adopted the method of on-site harvesting, on-site threshing, on-site preservation, and on-site fertilizer accumulation and on-site fertilizer application, saving more than half of the labor. Many places have implemented sheep pens on the mountains and pig pens in the plots (setting up pig farms in high-yield plots), which also greatly saves labor. These tricks can be found in every production link. We must study them specifically according to different situations and adopt the most labor-saving method to deploy agricultural production and construction.

    Labor management should also be improved to adapt to the needs of comprehensive agricultural development. Generally, production teams should be taken as units. Based on the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of all aspects, a comprehensive balance should be made for the labor required in all aspects. Comprehensive production teams and specialized production teams should be established. Agriculture should be the focus during busy farming seasons, and sideline businesses should be the focus during slack farming seasons. When both agricultural and sideline businesses are busy, labor should be rationally arranged in proportion; at the same time, methods such as combining long-term plans and short-term arrangements, combining fixed division of labor and temporary allocation, and combining specialized team production and certain periods of overall assault should be adopted to ensure the comprehensive development of agricultural production and diversified operations.

    Give Full Play to the Superiority of People's Communes and Promote the Sustained Leap Forward of Agricultural Production

    Giving full play to the great superiority of the people's communes and continuing to consolidate and gradually improve the people's communes is a basic guarantee for rapidly developing agricultural production and realizing agricultural modernization.

    At present, the three-level ownership system based on production teams implemented by the people's communes is basically adapted to agricultural productivity. We must give full play to the active role of the existing relations of production in the people's communes and promote the great development of production. The production team is the basic accounting unit of the people's commune, and special attention should be paid to further improving the management level of the production team. We must conscientiously and correctly implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system, and be sure to implement the three guarantee indicators to the small teams before March. We must continue to adhere to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, improve the democratic management system of financial work, and rationally use and save funds. Special attention should be paid to helping poor teams and transforming backward teams. At present, there are still about 25% of poor teams in Shaanxi Province, and they are required to catch up with the rich teams within a few years. To transform backward teams, we must seize the opportunity to transform them and strive to change them in the shortest possible time. To help poor teams and transform backward teams, we must fully mobilize the masses, educate the masses to establish great ambitions and lofty aspirations, dig out the roots of backwardness and poverty, seize the key to increasing production, take effective measures, work hard, and catch up. The state and the commune must continue to help poor teams from the aspects of materials and financial resources. Party committees at all levels must constantly strengthen the leadership of poor teams and backward teams. From the province to the county, they must grasp several times a year, and the commune must grasp it more often. Cadres of counties, communes, and management districts must often go deep into poor teams and backward teams, participate in production, help with work, or take turns serving as deputy leaders. The vast majority of cadres who are sent to work and exercise labor should be sent to poor teams and backward teams. Special attention should be paid to strengthening the leadership backbone of poor teams and backward teams, and consolidating the leadership advantages of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    While actively developing the production team economy, attention should be paid to strengthening the collective economy. The strengthening of the collective economy can more powerfully promote the development of agricultural and industrial production and create conditions for gradually realizing agricultural modernization and gradually transitioning to a system that is basically owned by the commune. At present, the strength of the collective economy in Shaanxi Province is still very small. Together with the public accumulation submitted by the production team, it still accounts for less than 10% of the commune's three-level income. It is necessary to make the economic income of the commune level exceed the income of the production team in about eight years. In addition to appropriately extracting a certain amount of public accumulation from the production team, the strengthening of the economic strength at the commune level mainly depends on the development of commune-run production undertakings. Simultaneous development of industry and agriculture is the basic way to develop the commune economy. Industrial accumulation is fast, which is suitable for communes to run, and can also promote the technological transformation of agriculture. Therefore, commune-run production undertakings should be based on industry, and at the same time, actively develop various undertakings such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline businesses, and fishery according to local conditions. At present, it is especially necessary to run pig farms and livestock farms in a big way, taking pigs as the head and promoting the great development of animal husbandry. To strengthen the collective economy, it is necessary to make overall plans and make rational arrangements on the basis of developing the production team economy. The commune level should run more enterprises with a larger scale, more complex management, and difficult or unsuitable for production teams to run. All the tools, breeding livestock, seedlings, etc. required for commune-run production undertakings should be purchased by the commune. When purchasing from production teams and commune members, the principle of democratic consultation and equivalent exchange must be resolutely implemented. We must mobilize and give play to all the enthusiasm of the three-level ownership system to rapidly develop agricultural production.

    The process of continuing to consolidate and gradually improve the people's communes is also a process of struggle between new and old ideas, which also contains the struggle between two roads. Since last winter, the rectification movement in rural areas with the struggle between two roads and socialist education as the main theme has achieved great victories, but the struggle between two roads has not ended, and thoroughly overcoming the ideological influence of capitalism and the old habits is still a long-term struggle. In future rural work, we should still adhere to the struggle between two roads and socialist education as the main theme, and constantly improve the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses. In all work, widely set up pacesetters, and carry out specific and vivid education through commending the model deeds and advanced ideas of advanced figures. For a small number of wealthy middle peasants with capitalist ideas, we must continue to strengthen education and transformation through various practical work. We must constantly strengthen the rural party organizations to make them strong fighting fortresses on the production front and the political and ideological front.

    Establish Lofty Aspirations and Improve Leadership Methods

    To strengthen the agricultural front by every possible means, the most fundamental strategy lies in strengthening the Party's leadership over the agricultural front. First of all, leading cadres must ideologically prevent and overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, and greatly establish the lofty aspirations of Marxism-Leninism. To rapidly develop agricultural production, quickly change the backward economic and cultural conditions of the province, and realize the beautiful prospects of iron cattle plowing the land, electric lights illuminating, crisscrossing river networks, mountains full of flowers and fruits, abundant grains, prosperous livestock, developed industry, and prosperous culture, the key lies in great drive. Dragging on, with many difficulties, with this being impossible and that being impossible, these are all the worldviews of cowards and lazy people, and there is not a bit of Marxist ambition. The attitude towards difficulties is not a small problem, but a problem of two worldviews. The most fundamental characteristic of proletarian revolutionaries is to overcome all difficulties and thoroughly transform the world; bourgeois revolutionaries are neither willing nor courageous to thoroughly transform the world. This is precisely the fundamental difference between our worldviews. To lead a county, a commune, or a production team, we must establish the great ambition to build it into a happy paradise. Only by establishing lofty aspirations can we fully develop our intelligence and revolutionary drive, and move forward bravely towards victory. Marxist ambition requires us to establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution and continuous overcoming of difficulties, and eliminate the idea of ​​fearing difficulties and living in peace, and the decline of revolutionary will; it requires us to establish a revolutionary idealism that can both see the present and foresee the future, and eliminate the mediocre and mediocre affairs that only see the immediate future and lack grand ideals; it requires us to establish the idea of ​​striving to be the best at all times and catching up with the advanced in everything, and eliminate the right-leaning conservative idea of ​​being content with being in the middle; it requires us to have a high degree of realistic spirit, and combine lofty ideals with the spirit of hard work, and combine soaring revolutionary drive with realistic and scientific analysis. Only in this way can we competently lead the people who are energetic and energetic, and create more brilliant achievements on the agricultural front.

    Secondly, we must strengthen the Party's organizational leadership over the agricultural front. The provincial party committee, the regional party committee, the county party committee, and the commune party committee must all list agriculture as the center of all work, and the agricultural leadership institutions at all levels must truly become powerful assistants to the party committee's leadership over agriculture. Those who cannot adapt to the needs of work should be adjusted and strengthened. A group of cadres with firm standpoints, full of energy, lofty aspirations, and strong abilities should be transferred to strengthen the weak links and the front line of agricultural leadership.

    Finally, we must continue to improve and improve the methods of leading agriculture by party committees at all levels, and further implement the Party's mass line and launch mass movements in a big way. To rapidly develop agricultural production and gradually realize agricultural modernization, we must further rely on the broad masses of peasants and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. The mass movement to lead agricultural production is not, as some people think, just spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvesting, and winter storage, repeating itself, and generally calling and inspecting, but to constantly go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, grasp the key, seize the opportunity, insert red flags, help the backward, and create a lively and better leap forward situation. To lead agricultural production, on the one hand, we must make overall plans and arrange things in a unified way, and on the other hand, we must focus on key points and attack key points fiercely. Not only should we grasp those general common key points, but also constantly proceed from the actual situation at the time and place, and grasp which are the most effective and more realistic key points. For example, under the principle of complying with the state's unified plan, which crops are most likely to produce high and stable yields; in diversified operations, which are the fastest to develop and the most useful; and which yield-increasing measures require less labor and money and yield the most benefits. For these questions, we must conduct in-depth investigations, specific analysis and research, and grasp them firmly and fiercely, so that the leadership will not fall into a generalized and superficial state. We should pay special attention to discovering and supporting new things in a timely manner. The most effective method is to always pay attention to inserting red flags and establishing pacesetters, and to summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner, so as to drive the general with the advanced. There are many large and small red flags and pacesetters in various places. In the past, some were discovered and promoted; some were discovered, but the summary and promotion were not enough; and many have not yet been discovered. Generally speaking, the work in this area is still weak and needs to be greatly strengthened. The recent enlarged meeting of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee decided to launch a campaign of 100,000 red flag units and 1 million red flag bearers throughout the province. The widespread development of this movement will greatly promote the socialist competition with technological revolution and cultural revolution as the central content. Party committees and departments at all levels are required to work hard to lead this movement, investigate and study the red flags and pacesetters within their scope, arrange them in a good order, and summarize and promote them in a planned and in-depth manner. At the same time, pay attention to specifically helping backward areas and units, and leading them to catch up with the advanced and leap forward together. The time and season of agricultural production have an inseparable connection between before and after. Grasping this season well will lay the foundation for the next season; grasping this year well will create conditions for the next year. We must prominently seize the opportunity and the season, grasp early and do it early, grasp early and do it fiercely, and for 365 days a year, we must grasp it every day, grasp it tightly, and grasp it to the end. From the province to the production team, the whole party and all cadres work together to widely mobilize the broad masses of peasants, launch a mass-based assault movement, and complete the most arduous and tense tasks in agricultural production.

    Recently, the drought situation has been quite serious, and the growth of summer crops and the sowing of cotton and early autumn crops have been greatly threatened. Overcoming drought has become the most important and urgent task on the agricultural front. Whether there is an idea of ​​taking agriculture as the foundation and implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and whether one is willing to strengthen the agricultural front, etc., will be tested in the current anti-drought struggle. We must be able to withstand this test, we must twist the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants into one rope, and carry out a spring production movement centered on drought resistance. Through the anti-drought struggle, we will seize a great harvest of the first crop of grain; through the anti-drought struggle, we will fight the first battle to strengthen the agricultural front and lay a solid foundation for the overall harvest and sustained leap forward of agriculture.

    千方百计加强农业战线
    中共陕西省委书记处书记　方仲如
    加强农业战线是当前的首要任务
    千方百计地加强农业战线，这是高速度、按比例地发展社会主义经济的中心环节，因而也就是陕西省党组织和全体人民当前的首要任务。
    农业是国民经济的基础。只有实现农业现代化，高速度地发展农业生产，才能解决全体人民吃饭穿衣的大问题，才能不断扩大工业原料的供应和资金积累的来源，并且为发展工业逐步腾出大量的劳动力；也才能在现代化技术的基础上进一步巩固工农联盟。我们党和毛泽东同志一贯重视农业问题。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，中央更进一步地确定了以农业为基础，在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，对马克思列宁主义政治经济学增加了新的内容。同全国各地一样，陕西省党的组织和广大人民，坚决执行了党中央和毛泽东同志的这个正确方针。正因为如此，我们的农业战线才能够不断取得伟大的成绩，并且以农业的大跃进促进了工业和其它事业的全面跃进。1958年，全省的农业生产获得了史无前例的特大丰收；1959年，虽然遭受了数十年未有的百日大旱，农副业总产值仍比大跃进的1958年增长12％以上，比1957年增长50％左右。同1949年相比，耕地面积虽然有所减少，粮食产量却增加了近一倍，棉花增长了二倍。1959年，全省工业总产值比1958年增长了48％，比1957年增长了一倍半，并且超过了农业总产值；不仅轻工业有了巨大的发展，而且建立了钢铁工业的基地，有了较多的机械制造工业。1957年的商品购进总值比1958年增长66％以上，商品供应总值比1958年增长40．8％；全年国民总收入比1958年增长16％以上。其他经济文化事业，也都有了巨大的发展。上述各方面的成就，都是在农业大跃进的基础上取得的，如果没有农业的跃进，其他事业的发展就是不可设想的。
    既然我们一贯重视农业，而农业战线的形势又是极为良好，为什么还要提出加强农业战线的问题呢？这是因为，工业的更大跃进和人民生活的不断提高，要求农业战线提供更多的粮食、副食品和工业原料，输送更多的劳动力。但是，现有的农业生产水平还不能适应这个要求。陕西省的农业耕作还主要是采用着手工工具和畜力工具，劳动生产率还很不高；干旱、水土流失、风砂、冰雹、病虫等自然灾害，还没有从根本上得到控制。陕西省的农业产量较之先进地区还不是高产，粮食还缺少储备。在这种情况下，要加速实现工业现代化，国防现代化和科学文化的现代化，要促使整个国民经济更大、更好、更全面地持续跃进，就必须把农业放在首要地位，加速实现农业的现代化。同时，如果说在过去实现农业现代化的条件还不够充分，那么，在今天，这些条件比较成熟了。社会主义工业化基础的建立和工业支援农业的不断加强，为农业的现代化提供了物质技术条件；1958年的农业大丰收和1959年的继续跃进，为农业的持续跃进打开了局面、积累了丰富的经验；而人民公社的建立和健全发展，又进一步解放了农业的生产力，成为实现农业现代化和推动国民经济全面跃进的最重要的杠杆。有了这些有利条件，我们就有可能更有力地加强农业战线、加速农业的发展了。
    也许有人以为，加强农业战线意味着工业战线和其他战线不如过去重要了，可以松一口气了。事实恰恰相反，迅速发展农业同优先发展重工业，农业的更大跃进同国民经济的全面跃进，并不是互不相容的事，而是互为条件、互相促进的。加强农业是为了推动工业以至整个国民经济的全面跃进，而农业的加速发展，又需要工业以及其它事业的大力支援。所以提出加强农业战线的问题，决不会减弱工业和其它事业的地位和作用，相反的是加重了一切部门的任务，要求各个部门适应加速农业发展的需要来加强本身的工作。1959年，陕西省曾经采取工、农、商、交一条龙的办法，迅速解决了市场问题，促进了国民经济的全面发展。这个经验说明：社会主义建设的规模越大，速度越快，就越需要各个经济部门的高度集中和综合发展。那种把各项事业看作各自孤立、互相妨碍的观点显然是错误的。
    加强农业战线就是要使农业生产实现更大更好更全面的跃进。1960年是实现农业现代化的新阶段的开始。这一年的工作做好了，就为第二个五年计划的后两年和今后若干年的工作，奠定了基础，创造了条件。我们一定要抓紧这个关键年，想尽千方百计，夺取今年第一料庄稼大丰收。在此基础上，完成和超额完成全年的农业生产计划，为加强农业战线造成一个良好的开端。
    大抓水、肥、管，变低产为高产
    陕西省的农业生产虽然连续二年获得大丰收，但是占全省耕地三分之一左右的土地，产量还很低；而一般地区较之全国先进地区，也还不是高产。为了实现加速农业发展的要求，除了适当扩大耕地面积以外，最重要的任务就是变低产为高产，并使所有地区的产量都能稳步上升。
    能不能变低产为高产，事实早已作了答复。榆林专区采用引水拉沙、冲沙打地、引洪漫地和植树、种草、施肥等综合措施，改造了四百八十多万亩沙地。原来的漠漠荒沙变成了“满滩是牛羊，沙海把鱼养，塞上小江南，8月稻谷香”。改良后的一部分沙田，平均亩产二百多斤，大大超过低产区生产水平。突出的如榆林县归德堡公社花园沟生产队，1958年和1959年的平均亩产都在一千五百斤以上，在风沙区树立了连续高产的红旗，盩厔县采用放淤压碱和修台田、种水稻等办法改良盐碱地四万五千多亩，其中二万七千亩的平均产量由三十五斤提高到三百四十三斤，增产九倍之多。既然这些地方能够办到，和它们条件相同甚至更好的地方就一定能够办到。
    为了变低产为高产，必须贯彻实行农业增产的“八字宪法”，特别是要大抓水、肥、管这几项关键性的技术措施。
    陕西省农业生产上有三大敌人，一是干旱，二是水土流失，三是风沙。为了治旱，必须大兴水利；为了治山，必须大搞水土保持；为了治沙，必须引水进沙，以水拉沙。总之，治水，这是战胜自然灾害、改变陕西省农业生产面貌的头等重要的措施，必须大抓特抓。治水，既要有全面规划，又要抓住重点，既要大兴水利，又要防治水患。我们要求在十年左右，治好五河二江（即：无定河、延河、洛河、泾河、渭河、丹江、汉江），控制水土流失，作到无山不绿，有水皆清，平川河网化，山塬梯田化，耕地水利化，大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收。当前治水重点，是向高原、山坡和沙漠、草原进军，采用引水上山，引水进沙，排水洗碱等种种办法，大力改造低产田；同时，在现有的灌溉区进一步利用水利资源，实现高标准水利化。在水利建设中，必须坚持蓄水为主，大中小结合，地面水、地下水一齐抓的方针；并把兴修、管理、利用三者结合起来，充分发挥一切水利设施的灌溉效益，克服有水不用、大水小用、长水短用的现象，要像铜川富平公社那样，力争修一亩，成一亩，修一段，引一段，用一段。
    肥料是植物的粮食，是变低产为高产的另一个基本因素。解决肥料问题，要以养猪为中心，实行养猪、积肥、种绿肥、制化肥同时并举的方针。养猪积肥，对于提高农业产量，效果非常显著。兴平县普集公社肖马生产队，在最近一年多的时间里，生猪猛增二十倍，使麦田施肥量增加了二倍，小麦产量增加近一倍。养猪不仅可以积肥，而且猪肉是重要的副食品，猪鬃、猪毛是重要的工业原料，猪内脏可以制药。正像群众说的，一多可以变五多——猪多、肥多、粮多、积累多、收入多。陕西省一定要在全省范围广泛深入地开展一个养猪运动，发动各行各业人人动手大养其猪。养猪，首先要解决猪源和饲料问题。为此，必须坚持自繁自养的方针，开展全留、全配、全怀、全产、全活和双重配、连续配、热胎配的满怀高产运动，并且推广鄠县养猪能手刘秀英创造的使母猪多生仔猪的方法；要建立饲料基地，发展饲料生产，并且大量收集、储存各种野生饲料和广泛利用各种农作物的副产品。养猪，还要大力加强饲养管理，特别要大抓防瘟，要让所有人民公社的兽医员或饲养员都学会三原县范玉琦、熊德有同志的针灸治猪瘟的技术，把猪的死亡率减少到最小限度。搜肥、积肥必须结合卫生防疫工作经常地进行，在经常工作的基础上，每年搞几次全民性的积肥驱瘟运动。与此同时，人民公社要尽可能地办小型的化肥厂和农药厂，采取土洋结合的方法进行生产，并且要大抓绿肥。
    在全部耕作过程中，田间管理的活路最多，一年三百六十五天几乎天天都有工作要做。我们必须抓紧这个环节，实行精耕细作，注意耕作方法的不断革新。全省各地在这方面有着丰富的经验，例如，张秋香的植棉技术，刘述贤务育小麦的技术，王保京全面革新耕作技术的经验，都具有显著的增产效果，应当进一步切实地在全省推广。烽火公社创造的宽行套种间作耕作制度，为提高土地利用率提出了新的方向，应当在更大的范围内进行试验。条锈病对陕西省小麦生产危害很大，根据预测，今年关中地区的条锈病，将有较大的流行。我们绝不能麻痹大意，锈病不灭，防治不歇。
    大面积丰产方是综合采用各种增产措施、促进多种作物全面丰产的一个行之有效的方法，是耕作制度的一项重大改革。各地应当拿出三分之一左右的耕地来大搞丰产方，所有丰产方都要建立指挥田和田间档案制，实行领导干部、技术人员和群众三结合，政治、技术和组织措施三到方，优先实现水利化，园田化，优先实现技术革新，保证高产，通过丰产方带动全部农田大丰收。
    以工具改革和半机械化为中心，不断提高农业劳动生产率
    提高农业劳动生产率的根本出路，是实现农业机械化。只有实现了农业机械化，才能使农业的生产水平进一步适应工业的高速度发展，才能解放出大量的劳动力来支援工业战线和其他战线。不过，工业支援农业的力量是逐步增加的，农业机械化，也必须经过由土到洋、由低到高的过程，逐步地实现。因此，我们既要采取积极态度，尽量加快机械化的速度，又要反对那种喜“洋”不喜“土”，等大机器的思想。在第二个五年计划期间，着重抓工具改革和半机械化，同时选择一些人口稠密、交通便利、商品生产率较高的地区，集中使用农业机械，实行部分机械化，培养典型、积累经验、训练干部，为实现全面机械化准备条件。
    当前工具改革的重点应放在费力多、强度大、用途广、效果好的耕作、水利、运输、加工、养猪、炊事等六大项工具方面。要狠狠地抓、成套地改。不仅六大项工具相互之间要配套，每一项工具改革也要成套。许多地方在这方面已经创造出好的经验。例如：汉中专区有一百四十多个水利工地从挖土、运土到装卸、夯压，全面地革新了水利施工工具，大大提高了工效。乾县粮食局的醴泉直属粮库对收粮、调运、保管，全面实现了土机械化。从去年2月至今年1月，节省劳动日近两万个，畜力三千多头，节约资金七万多元，减少粮食损耗五万多斤。这些经验应当在全省范围加以推广。在工具改革中，还须注意工具的综合利用，并且尽量采用水力机械，力求作到一物多用，作到费力小、花钱少、收效大。
    陕西省自然情况比较复杂，又具有精耕细作的优良传统，农业的工具改革和机械化，必须适应这种情况，同自然条件和耕作技术方面的特殊要求结合起来。例如，山地和稻田如何实现机械化，田间作业工具和套种间作如何适应，收获工具如何适应关中地区小麦密度高、植株粗壮的特点，等等，都要进行具体研究，逐步加以解决。不论是现有工具的改革，或是新式机器的采用，都必须经过认真的研究和试验，然后积极而有步骤地加以推广。既不能只顾创造，不注意推广，也不要不看条件地一哄而起。
    在大搞工具改革和半机械化的同时，还须注意生产的合理布局和劳动力的合理安排。合理布局可以减少农产品和其他物资的往返调运，减少许多不必要的劳力消耗，大大提高劳动生产率。例如，长安县建立田间生产点，在节约用地的原则下，选择田间适中地点盘场、打井、修猪圈、修仓房，采用就地收获、就地碾打、就地保藏和就地积肥、就地施肥的办法，节省劳力一半以上。许多地方实行的羊圈上山、猪圈进方（在丰产方中设养猪场），也大大节省了劳力。这些窍门在各个生产环节上都可以找到，我们要分别不同情况，加以具体研究，采取最节省劳力的办法，来部署农业的生产和建设。
    劳动管理，也要适应农业综合发展的需要加以改进。一般地应当以生产队为单位，根据保证重点，全面照顾的原则，对各方面需要的劳动力进行综合平衡，要建立综合生产小队和专业生产小队，农忙集中抓农业，农闲集中抓副业，农副业都忙的时候，按比例合理安排劳力；同时，采取长计划和短安排相结合，固定分工和临时调配相结合，专业队生产和一定时期的全体突击相结合的办法，保证农业生产和多种经营的全面发展。
     发挥人民公社的优越性，促进农业生产持续跃进
    充分发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，继续巩固和逐步提高人民公社，这是迅速发展农业生产和实现农业现代化的一个基本保证。
    现在，人民公社实行的以生产队为基础的三级所有制，同农业的生产力基本上是适应的。我们要充分发挥人民公社现有生产关系的积极作用，促进生产的巨大发展。生产队是人民公社的基本核算单位，特别要注意进一步提高生产队的经营管理水平。要切实地、正确地贯彻执行三包一奖制度，3月份前一定要把三包指标落实到小队。要继续坚持勤俭办社的方针，健全财务工作的民主管理制度，合理使用和节约资金。特别要注意扶助穷队和改造落后队。现在陕西省还有25％左右的穷队，要求在几年内全部赶上富队。对落后队要抓紧改造，力争在最短期间改变过来。扶助穷队和改造落后队，都要充分发动群众，教育群众立大志、树雄心，挖出落后和贫穷的根子，抓住增产关键，采取有效措施，奋发苦干，迎头赶上。国家和公社要继续从物力、财力等方面帮助穷队。各级党委必须经常加强对穷队和落后队的领导，从省到县每年要大抓几次，公社更要经常去抓。县、社、管理区的干部，必须经常深入穷队和落后队，参加生产，帮助工作，或者轮流担任领导副职，下放劳动锻炼的干部，绝大多数要派到穷队和落后队去。特别要注意加强穷队和落后队的领导骨干，巩固地建立起贫农和下中农的领导优势。
    在积极发展生产队经济的同时，要注意壮大社有经济。社有经济的壮大，能够更有力地促进农业和工业生产的发展，为逐步实现农业现代化和逐步过渡到基本上是公社所有制创造条件。目前，陕西省社有经济力量还很小，加上从生产队提交的公共积累，还占不到公社三级收入的10％。必须在八年左右使社一级的经济收入超过生产队的收入。社一级经济力量的壮大，除了适当地向生产队提取一定的公共积累以外，主要依靠发展社办生产事业。工农业并举是发展公社经济的基本途径，工业积累快，宜于公社举办，又能促进农业的技术改造。所以，社办生产事业应以工业为主体，同时因地制宜地积极发展农、林、牧、副、渔各种事业。目前特别要大办养猪场，畜牧场，以猪为首，推动畜牧业的大发展。壮大社有经济，一定要在发展生产队经济的基础上统筹兼顾，合理安排。社一级应多办一些规模较大、管理比较复杂、生产队难以举办或不宜举办的企业。社办生产事业所需的全部工具、种畜、树苗等，都应由社购置，需要向生产队和社员购置时，要坚决贯彻民主协商、等价交换的原则。我们要调动和发挥三级所有制的全部积极性，迅速发展农业生产。
    继续巩固和逐步提高人民公社的过程，也是新旧思想斗争的过程，其中也包含着两条道路的斗争。去冬以来农村中以两条道路斗争和社会主义教育为纲的整社运动，已经取得了伟大胜利，但是两条道路的斗争还没有结束，彻底克服资本主义的思想影响和旧的习惯势力，还是一个长期的斗争。在今后的农村工作中，仍然应当坚持以两条道路斗争和社会主义教育为纲，不断提高广大群众的政治思想觉悟。在各项工作中，广泛树立标兵，通过表扬先进人物的模范事迹和先进思想，进行具体生动的教育。对于一小部分具有资本主义思想的富裕中农，要通过各种实际工作，继续加强教育和改造。我们要不断加强农村党的组织，使之在生产战线和政治思想战线上，成为坚强的战斗堡垒。
    树立雄心壮志，改进领导方法
    千方百计加强农业战线，最根本的一计在于加强党对农业战线的领导。首先要使领导干部从思想上要防止和克服右倾保守思想，大立马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志。我们要迅速发展农业生产，尽快改变全省经济、文化的落后面貌，实现铁牛耕地、电灯照明、河网纵横、花果满山、五谷丰登、六畜兴旺、工业发达、文化繁荣的美好远景，关键在于很大的干劲。拖拖沓沓、困难重重，这也不可能，那也办不到，这些都是懦夫和懒汉的世界观，半点马克思主义的雄心壮志都没有。对待困难的态度，不是一个小问题，而是两种世界观的问题。无产阶级革命家最根本的特点是，要战胜一切困难，彻底改造世界；资产阶级革命家，既不愿意也没有勇气来彻底改造世界。这正是我们同他们世界观上的根本分歧。领导一个县、一个公社、一个生产队，都要树立起把那里建设成幸福乐园的伟大志气。只有树立起雄心壮志，才能充分发挥出聪明才智和革命干劲，勇往直前地奔向胜利。马克思主义的雄心壮志，要求我们树立不断革命、不断克服困难的思想，破除畏难苟安、革命意志衰退的思想；要求我们树立既能看到现在又能预见未来的富有革命理想的现实主义，破除只看到眼前，缺乏远大理想的庸庸碌碌的事务主义；要求我们树立时时争上游、事事赶先进的思想，破除甘居中游的右倾保守思想；要求我们具有高度的求实精神，把远大的理想与踏实苦干的精神结合起来，把冲天的革命干劲与实事求是的科学分析结合起来。只有这样，我们才能够胜任地领导气壮山河干劲冲天的人民群众，在农业战线上创造出更加辉煌的丰功伟绩。
    其次，要加强党对农业战线的组织领导。省委、地委、县委和公社党委，都要把农业列为全部工作的中心，农业方面的各级领导机构，要真正成为党委领导农业的有力助手。不能适应工作需要的，要加以调整和加强。要调派一批立场坚定、干劲充沛、有雄心壮志和能力较强的干部，加强农业领导方面的薄弱环节和第一线。
    最后，要继续改进和提高各级党委领导农业的方法，进一步贯彻党的群众路线、大搞群众运动。迅速发展农业生产，逐步实现农业现代化，一定要进一步依靠广大农民群众，充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性。领导农业生产的群众运动，并不像有些人所想的，只是春耕、夏耘、秋收、冬藏，周而复始，一般地号召和检查，而是要经常深入群众，深入实际，抓关键，抓时机，插红旗，帮落后，造成一个生动活泼的更大更好的跃进局面。领导农业生产，一方面要全面部署，统筹安排，另一方面又要狠抓重点，猛攻关键。不仅要抓那些一般的共同的重点和关键，而且要经常从当时当地的实际情况出发，抓哪些最有效益的更加切合实际的重点和关键。例如，在服从国家统一计划的原则下，种植哪些作物最能高产稳收；多种经营中，哪些发展速度最快，最有用处；哪些增产措施费工花钱较少，收效得益最多。对于这些问题，都要进行深入的调查，具体的分析研究，抓紧、抓狠，才使领导不致于陷入一般化的浮浅状态。我们要特别注意及时发现和扶植新生事物，最有效的方法就是要经常注意插红旗、立标兵，及时总结和推广先进经验，以先进带动一般。各地都有许多大大小小的红旗和标兵，过去有的发现了，也推广了；有的发现了，总结和推广不够；有许多还没有发现。总的说来，这方面的工作还是薄弱的，需要大大加强。最近陕西省委扩大会议决定在全省开展一个十万红旗单位、百万名红旗手的运动。这个运动的广泛开展，将要大大推进以技术革命和文化革命为中心内容的社会主义竞赛。要求各级党委和各部门要努力领导好这一运动，把自己范围内的红旗和标兵调查研究一番，好好排个队，有计划地深入地加以总结和推广。同时要注意具体帮助落后的地区和单位，带动他们赶上先进，共同跃进。农业生产的时间和季节，前后之间有着不可分割的联系，抓好这一季，就给下一季打好了基础；抓好今年，就给明年创造了条件。我们要突出地抓住时机和季节，一早百早，抓早抓狠，一年三百六十五天，要天天抓、抓紧、抓到底。从省一直到生产队，全党和全体干部一齐动手，广泛发动全体农民群众，大搞群众性的突击运动，完成农业生产上最繁重紧张的任务。
    近来，旱象相当严重，夏季作物的生长和棉花、早秋作物的播种，受到很大的威胁。战胜干旱，已经成为农业战线上最重要、最迫切的任务。有没有以农业为基础，实行工农业并举的思想，愿不愿加强农业战线等问题，在目前，就要在抗旱斗争中来考验。我们一定要经得起这种考验，一定要把工农兵学商扭成一股劲，开展千军万马的以抗旱为中心的春季生产运动。通过抗旱斗争，夺取第一料庄稼大丰收；通过抗旱斗争，打好加强农业战线的第一仗，为农业的全面丰收和持续跃进奠定稳固的基础。
