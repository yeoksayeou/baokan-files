Afforestation Changes the Face of Dianbai County
Wang Zhan'ao, First Secretary of the Dianbai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Under Chairman Mao's great call to "Greening the Motherland," Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, has continuously carried out large-scale afforestation campaigns in recent years, and the entire county has now basically achieved greening. In the past few years, Dianbai County has afforested a total of 1.65 million mu, which is 113 times the area afforested before liberation. More than 88% of the barren mountains and wasteland have grown clumps of trees. Along the county's 1,000 kilometers of roads, three to five rows of large trees have been planted, with two rows each of bamboo forests and fruit trees planted along 300 kilometers of roads. 722 kilometers of riverbanks along the county's 95 rivers of all sizes have formed bamboo forest belts. Protective forest belts have been created along 101 kilometers of coastline. The 40-kilometer coastline of the two peninsulas, Bohe and Nanhai, has achieved "four belts" (forest belt, bamboo belt, fruit tree belt, and mangrove belt). People's communes throughout the county have universally established orchards, planting more than 94,000 mu of fruit trees.

	When the rain stops, the soil dries first,
	The summer sun is scorching;
	When the wind comes, sand and dust cover the sky,
	Good farmland turns into sandy wasteland.

This folk rhyme circulating in Dianbai County in the old society is a true reflection of the county's past natural appearance. Dianbai County is located in the arid Jianjiang Plain, and the natural conditions are very harsh. On the eve of liberation, of the county's 3.18 million mu of land, only 21,000 mu were planted with trees. The central hilly area was full of collapsing mountains and rotten ridges, where grass and trees did not grow, and barren yellow earth filled the eyes; the southern coast was a vast expanse of white sand, with sandstorms obscuring the sun in spring, autumn, and winter, and the barren sand burning feet in summer, with no one to be seen. When typhoons came, the lives of people and livestock were at risk. Due to the scarcity of forests and the lack of water conservancy, the level of agricultural production was very low, and the people's lives were extremely poor.

Under the socialist system, the broad masses of the people in Dianbai County had a strong desire to completely transform the natural landscape. However, due to the extreme poverty and backwardness caused by the reactionary rule before liberation, some people had serious feelings of inferiority. When the afforestation movement began, some people along the coast said that trees could not survive on the sandy beaches; some people in the hilly areas said that trees could not grow on collapsing ridges and thin soil; some people in the mountainous areas said that there was a shortage of labor for afforestation due to the small number of people. In a word, afforestation and greening could be done in other places, but not in Dianbai County. In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles, we carried out extensive mobilization, propaganda, and debates among the masses, and while doing a good job in ideological mobilization, we paid attention to cultivating typical examples and setting up banners to spread the movement from points to areas.

In 1954, the county committee conducted a pilot project for building a protective forest belt on Bohe beach. At that time, many people thought it would not be successful. The first trial planting also failed. At this time, many people lost confidence, only the party members, the League members and activists, with the support of the Party, insisted on continuing. We summed up the lessons of the first failure and conducted a second trial planting in the autumn of the same year. This time, we improved the planting techniques, adopted the methods of cultivating backfill soil, applying fertilizer, and watering diligently, and finally achieved success. This made people believe in the truth that "man can conquer nature." People built up confidence from here and relied on the collective strength of mutual aid and cooperation organizations to launch a full-scale march to the beach.

Bohe Town is a fishing port. When men went to sea, the task of afforestation fell on the shoulders of women. Originally, afforestation on the beach was difficult enough, but to ask fishermen's women, who had never had any agricultural labor habits for thousands of years, to do afforestation was even more difficult. They had no tools, so they used pot shovels to dig holes, used snail shells to water, and used buckets to carry mud. Some people's palms were blistered, and some people's feet were swollen from the heat, but they didn't say a word, wiped on some mercurochrome, wrapped a handkerchief, and went back to work. In order to provide sufficient base fertilizer for the saplings, in the midst of the crash program to accumulate fertilizer, the female Communist Party member Chen Jiao took the lead in jumping into the pond when a cold wave struck. Following her, the masses also took off their cotton-padded clothes and jumped down one after another. On the beach of Bohe, heroic people, with selfless labor and diligent hands, finally built a protective forest belt more than 20 kilometers long. Now the coast is lush and green, the forest belt is shaded by dense foliage, and birds sing incessantly; outside the forest belt, the newly built ponds ripple with water. The once vast expanse of white sand has now become a pleasant seaside park.

The success of afforestation on Bohe beach sounded the clarion call for a full-scale march towards nature. People all understood that the main measures to fundamentally change the desolate and impoverished face of Dianbai County were afforestation and water conservancy construction. The Dianbai County Committee adopted different policies according to the three different regions: in the mountainous areas, plant more timber forests, economic forests, and fuel forests, expand agroforestry intercropping, and plant crops on the mountains; in the coastal areas, take measures to prevent disasters, start with the easy and then the difficult, advance from points to areas, and connect points into belts to build protective forest belts; in the hilly areas, focus on building soil and water conservation forests, and plant various trees accordingly. The decision of the County Committee was warmly supported by all the people. In 1956, under Chairman Mao's great call to "Greening the Motherland in Twelve Years," the afforestation movement developed even more vigorously. Because people personally experienced the benefits of afforestation, the masses' enthusiasm for planting trees became higher and higher, and the scale of the afforestation movement expanded year by year. "Prepare all year round, make a concentrated effort when it rains, and afforest in all seasons" has become a system consciously observed by the masses. During each major campaign, the party, government, army, and people were always mobilized, and leading cadres and the masses together picked up hoes, carried dry rations, brought pots and bowls, carried saplings, and marched mightily to the beaches and mountains, with a sea of people planting trees everywhere.

With the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of the people's communes, the greening movement entered a new stage in 1958 and 1959. The scale of afforestation in these two years was unprecedented, with a high tide of afforestation and greening lasting 40 to 50 days each year, involving two to three million people. Dianbai County implemented the "three guarantees" method of ensuring planting, survival, and growth in the afforestation movement, so it was able to cultivate good seedlings, dig large holes, water thoroughly, and apply sufficient fertilizer. When afforesting along roads and on collapsing ridges and thin soil, holes were dug three feet deep and three feet wide, and one to two dan of base fertilizer was applied to each plant. During the movement, the entire population planted trees, and professional teams managed them year-round, so the survival rate of afforestation reached more than 90%. At the same time, we also implemented the policy of focusing on crash afforestation, year-round forest protection, and attaching equal importance to afforestation and forest protection, and launched a mass forest protection movement with the division of management areas and contracting to the end.

In the past few years, the afforestation movement has brought about tremendous changes in the county's natural landscape. In the northern mountainous area, barren mountains have become the Wanbao Mountains with lush mountains, clear waters, and dense bamboo forests. 500,000 mu of barren mountains throughout the county have been transformed into agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry areas, with mountains and fields covered with forests and fruit trees, not only greening the barren mountains and beautifying the environment, but also opening up a way to develop sideline production and increase income. In the central hilly area, because forests were planted on the collapsing mountains and rotten ridges, mountain floods were controlled and soil and water were conserved. The county has controlled soil erosion in an area of 305 square kilometers, accounting for 78% of the total soil erosion area, protecting 91,000 mu of farmland. In these areas, even if there is a torrential rain of 300 millimeters, it can be guaranteed that water will not flow down the mountains and mud will not flow out of the ditches, ensuring a bumper harvest of farmland. On the coastal beaches, protective forest belts like screens have controlled wind and sand, protected farmland and villages, and greatly reduced the threat of typhoons. More than 10,000 mu of sandy beaches within the forest network can be used to grow miscellaneous grains, and more than 4,000 mu of fields have been changed from single cropping to double cropping, with farmland reaping bumper harvests year after year.

The results of afforestation have not only obtained tremendous economic benefits and changed the landscape of the mountains and rivers, but also changed people's spiritual outlook. People have been liberated from the state of slaves who succumbed to nature, dare to be the masters of nature, and dare to issue orders to nature. In the past few years, despite encountering various natural disasters, the broad masses of cadres and people believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, giving full play to man's subjective initiative, they will be able to overcome any disaster. The fact is that various disasters have been overcome time and time again, and bumper harvests have been achieved year after year. At present, the people of the entire county are advancing by leaps and bounds towards the direction of turning the land into a garden on the basis of basic greening. (Attached picture)

    造林改变了电白县的面貌
    中共电白县委第一书记　王占鳌
    在毛主席“绿化祖国”的伟大号召下，广东省电白县几年来不断开展大规模造林运动，现在全县基本实现了绿化。几年来，电白县一共造林一百六十五万亩，相当解放前造林面积的一百一十三倍。88％以上的荒山、荒地都已长起了丛丛的树木。全县一千公里公路两旁，都栽上三至五行大树，其中三百公里公路两旁种上了竹林、果树各二行。全县大小河流九十五条，有七百二十二公里河岸形成了竹林带。一百零一公里海岸线营造了防护林带。博贺和南海两个半岛四十公里海岸线实现了“四带”（林带、竹带、果树带、红树带）。各人民公社普遍建立起百果园，共种下果树九万四千多亩。
    天雨未晴土先干，
    夏日太阳旱煞人；
    风来沙尘蔽天日，
    大好良田变沙岗。
    这首旧社会流传在电白县的歌谣，正是这个县过去自然面貌的真实写照。电白县地处干旱的鉴江平原，自然条件十分恶劣。解放前夕，全县三百一十八万亩土地中，种有树木的面积只有二万一千亩；中部丘陵地区，尽是崩山烂岭，草木不长，赤地黄土，满目荒凉；南部沿海，是一片白茫茫的沙滩，春秋冬季风沙蔽日，夏季荒沙烫脚，行人绝迹，台风一来，人畜生命难保。由于林木稀少，水利失修，农业生产水平很低，人民生活极端穷苦。
    在社会主义制度之下，电白县广大人民对于彻底改造自然面貌有着强烈的愿望。但是，由于解放前反动统治所造成的极端贫困和落后状况，部分人存在着严重的自卑情绪。当造林运动开始时，沿海有些人说，沙滩造林树木活不了；丘陵地区有些人说，崩岭瘦地种树长不起来；山区有些人说，人手少造林缺劳力，等等。一句话，造林绿化别的地方办得到，在电白县办不到。为了清除这些思想障碍，我们在群众中进行了大动员、大宣传、大辩论，做好思想发动工作的同时，注意培养典型，树立旗帜，使运动由点到面展开。
    1954年，县委在博贺海滩搞营造防护林带的试点，当时许多人认为搞不成。第一次试种也真的失败了。这时，很多人没信心，只有党、团员和积极分子，在党的支持下，坚持搞下去。我们总结了第一次失败的教训，在同年秋天又进行第二次试种。这次我们改进了种植技术，采取培客土、施肥料、勤浇水的办法，终于获得成功。这使人们确信“事在人为”的真理，人们从这里树立了信心，并依靠互助合作组织的集体力量，向海滩全面大进军。
    博贺镇是个渔港，男人出海，造林任务就落在妇女肩上。本来，沙滩造林已经是够困难了，而又要几千年来从没有农业劳动习惯的渔民妇女去造林，这真是难上加难。她们没有工具，就拿锅铲挖穴，用螺壳浇水，用水桶挑泥。有些人手掌磨起了血泡，有些人脚底给烫肿了，可是一声不响，擦上一点红汞水，手帕一包，又干起来。为了给树苗下足基肥，在突击积肥运动中，正当寒流侵袭，女共产党员陈娇第一个带头跳下水塘。跟着，群众也脱下棉衣，争先恐后的跳下去。在博贺这块沙滩上，英雄的人们以忘我劳动，用勤劳的双手，终于建成了一条长达二十多公里的防护林带。现在沿海一片青葱，林带里面浓阴蔽天，鸟啼不绝；林带外边，新修的池塘水波荡漾。昔日一片白茫茫沙滩，如今已变成景色宜人的海滨公园了。
    博贺海滩造林的成功，吹响了向大自然全面进军的号角。人们都懂得，要根本改变电白县荒凉贫困的面貌，主要措施是造林和兴修水利。电白县委根据三种不同地区采取不同方针：在山区多种用材林、经济林、薪炭林，扩大农林间种，作物上山；在沿海地区，采取因害设防，先易后难，由点到面，联点成带的办法营造防护林带；在丘陵地区，以营造水土保持林为主，相应地种各种林木。县委的决定获得全体人民的热烈拥护。1956年，在毛主席关于“十二年绿化祖国”的伟大号召下，造林运动更是波澜壮阔的开展起来。由于人们亲身受到造林的好处，群众植树的积极性越来越高，造林运动的规模一年比一年扩大，“常年准备，逢雨突击，四季造林”已经成为群众自觉遵守的制度。在每次大突击的日子里，总是党政军民总动员，领导干部和群众一起拿起锄头，背上口粮，带上锅碗，挑起树苗，浩浩荡荡的奔赴沙滩山野，到处是植树造林的人山人海。
    随着大跃进和人民公社的建立，1958年和1959年，绿化运动走上一个新的阶段。这两年造林的规模之大空前未有，每年都掀起为时四十天到五十天的造林绿化高潮，投入造林绿化运动达二、三百万人次。电白县在造林运动中实行保种、保活、保长的“三保”办法，因此做到了育好苗，开大穴，淋足水，施足肥料。在公路和崩岭、瘦地造林时，开穴三尺深、三尺宽，每株下基肥一至二担。运动中全民种，常年专业队管理，因此造林成活率达90％以上。与此同时，我们还贯彻了突击造林、长年护林，造林护林并重的方针，并开展了分片管理、包干到底的群众性护林运动。
    几年来造林运动使全县自然面貌发生了巨大变化。在北部山区，荒山变成了山青水秀、茂林修竹的万宝山了。全县有五十万亩荒山变成农、林、畜牧区，漫山遍野长满了林木和果树，不仅绿化了荒山，美化了环境，而且开辟了一个发展副业生产、增加收入的门路。在中部丘陵地区，由于崩山烂岭造了林，控制了山洪，保持了水土。全县已控制水土流失面积三百零五平方公里，占水土流失总面积的78％，保护农田九万一千亩。在这些地区，日下暴雨三百毫米也能保证水不下山、泥不出沟，保障了农田丰收。在沿海沙滩上，像屏风一样的防护林带，已控制了风沙，保护了农田和村庄，大大减少了台风的威胁。林网内有一万多亩沙滩可以种杂粮，四千多亩田由单造改双造，农田年年丰收。
    造林的结果，不仅获得了巨大的经济效益，改变了山河面貌，同时也改变了人们的精神面貌。人们从屈服于自然的奴隶状态下解放出来，敢于做大自然的主人，敢于向大自然发号施令。几年来，尽管碰到多种多样的自然灾害，但广大干部群众相信在党的正确领导下，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，是一定能战胜任何灾害的；而事实也正是一次又一次的战胜了各种灾害，获得连年大丰收。目前，全县人民正在基本绿化的基础上，朝着大地园林化的方向大步前进。（附图片）
