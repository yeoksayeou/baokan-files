Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 2nd. According to "Hoy" newspaper reports: The National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party began its plenary session in Havana on February 29th. Juan Marinello, Chairman of the People's Socialist Party, announced the agenda at the beginning of the meeting: First, the Executive Bureau's report on the current situation and the work of the Party, reported by General Secretary Blas Roca; Second, the report on national development issues and the activities of the working class, peasants, and the general masses, reported by Executive Secretary Escalante; Third, the report on the Party's National Congress, reported by Manuel Luzardo. Roca and Escalante have already reported on the first and second agenda items.

Roca, in analyzing the current situation in Cuba, said: Significant events and changes have occurred in the approximately four months since the last meeting. He emphasized three main characteristics of this revolutionary period: the progress and deepening of the revolution, which is the main feature; the increase in the number of enemies of the revolution; and the division of forces, with a clear demarcation between revolution and counter-revolution.

Roca said that every step more clearly and explicitly shows that the Cuban revolution is a patriotic, progressive, and radical revolution; this revolution for the poor and by the poor is today a struggle against semi-feudal large estates and against semi-colonial anti-imperialism.

Roca then listed the following advances, marking the progress and deepening of the revolution, which have been achieved recently: 1. Promoting the implementation of land reform; 2. Starting to eliminate the "mujahedin" (those who served tyranny in the past) from the trade union movement, and the Cuban Workers' Confederation withdrew from the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers; 3. Organizing worker-peasant militias; 4. Strengthening the organization, discipline, and revolutionary spirit of the Revolutionary Armed Forces; 5. Enhancing collaboration, cooperation, and unity among all revolutionary parties; 6. Promulgating the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law; 7. Resolutely carrying out the confiscation of the property of counter-revolutionaries; 8. Developing state ownership and an economy planned, controlled, and led by the state; 9. Announcing the convening of a conference of underdeveloped countries to be held in Havana at Cuba's initiative; 10. Cuba issued a joint communiqué with the Soviet Union, establishing trade relations between the two countries.

Roca emphasized in his report that the growth of state ownership in estates, commerce, and industry, as well as the implementation of realistic and effective control measures, is a great progress of the revolution. The growth of state ownership and the takeover of problematic enterprises are fundamental means of avoiding economic sabotage.

Roca praised the trade agreement and joint communiqué signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union. He said that this is the first time that a Latin American country has taken a stand on foreign policy that is in line with true independence and autonomy.

Roca then pointed out that although every step forward makes the revolution more consolidated, it would be wrong to underestimate the dangers involved in counter-revolutionary activities. We should increasingly and forcefully wage a constant struggle against counter-revolutionary activities in all aspects. U.S. imperialism and all the forces it possesses are the number one enemy of the Cuban revolution, the instigator of counter-revolutionary activities, and the shield, base camp, and weapons supplier of the counter-revolution. The imperialists have been attacking the revolution and the revolutionary government because they know that this revolution is a real revolution, and in front of them are revolutionaries determined to advance the Cuban revolution and the Latin American revolution. The imperialists are now at the core of the counter-revolution. The most aggressive imperialist forces are now directly manipulating counter-revolutionary activities, pushing Trujillo and their bases in the Dominican Republic into a secondary position. Cuba must continue to prepare militarily in order to resist all attacks and imperialist intervention.

However, Roca pointed out that imperialism can never subdue us by intervention. If imperialism understands this, it may be deterred from sending troops to land here. Therefore, the Cuban people must consciously learn to master weapons and strengthen the worker-peasant militias.

Referring to Cuba's recent diplomatic note to the United States regarding the proposal to negotiate with the United States, Roca said that we not only regard the American people as brothers, but also believe that more friendly and mutually beneficial relations should be established. However, such relations cannot be built on the basis of imperialism attacking us. Now is the time for the U.S. government to show its sincerity.

Referring to the U.S. economic threats, Roca pointed out that if the sugar quota is reduced, then the only thing they can really and finally get is to further intensify national anti-imperialist sentiment and suffer the consequences in front of the people of Cuba and all of Latin America.

Roca finally talked about developing party membership and building the party, as well as the task of maintaining a pure and reliable revolutionary contingent. In talking about the tasks put forward, he pointed out that this year we should make raising the revolutionary consciousness of party members and the ideological and political level of Marxism-Leninism the main task within the party. The meeting has begun discussing the reports on the first and second agenda items.

Prominent activists from communist parties in some Latin American countries attended the meeting as guests.

    在反帝反封建的斗争中获得巨大进展
    古巴革命日益深刻化
    古巴人民社会党总书记在党的全国委员会会议上指出：美帝国主义是古巴的头号敌人，古巴人民在前进中不能低估反革命的危险
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　据“今日报”报道：古巴人民社会党全国委员会2月29日开始在哈瓦那举行全体会议。人民社会党主席胡安·马里内略在会议开始时宣布的议程是：第一项，执行局关于目前形势和党的工作的报告，报告人为总书记布拉斯·罗加；第二项，关于国家发展问题和工人阶级、农民及一般人民群众的活动的报告，报告人为执行书记埃斯卡兰特；第三项，关于党的全国代表大会的报告，报告人为曼努埃尔·卢萨多。罗加和埃斯卡兰特已经就第一和第二两项议程作了报告。
    罗加在分析古巴目前的形势时说：从上次会议到现在约四个月期间，发生了重大的事件和变化。他着重指出了这个革命时期的三个主要特点：革命的进展和深刻化，这是主要特点；革命的敌人增加了；力量分化，革命和反革命的界限清楚了。
    罗加说，每一个步骤都更加清楚和明确地说明，古巴的革命是一个爱国主义的、先进的和激进的革命；这个为了贫苦人和由贫苦人进行的贫苦人的革命，今天是一场反对半封建大庄园制、反对半殖民主义的反帝国主义斗争。
    罗加接着列举了革命在最近所取得的标志着革命前进和深刻化的如下一些进展：一、推进了土地改革的实施；二、工会运动中开始清除（过去为暴政效劳的）穆哈耳分子，古巴工人联合会退出了美洲区域工人组织；三、组织了工农民兵；四、加强了革命武装部队的组织、纪律和革命精神；五、增进了所有革命党派之间的协作、合作和团结；六、颁布了矿业法和石油法；七、坚决地进行了没收反革命分子财产的工作；八、发展了国有制和由国家计划、控制和领导的经济；九、宣布召开根据古巴的倡议将在哈瓦那举行的不发达国家会议；十、古巴同苏联发表了联合公报，建立了两国间的贸易关系。
    罗加在报告中强调指出，在庄园、商业和工业方面的国有制的增长以及现实有效的控制措施的执行，是革命的巨大进展。国有制的增长和对发生问题的企业所进行的接管，是避免经济破坏的基本手段。
    罗加赞扬古巴同苏联签订的贸易协定和联合公报。他说，这是一个拉丁美洲国家破天荒第一次采取了符合于真正独立和自主的对外政策的立场。
    罗加随后指出，虽然革命每前进一步都使它更加巩固，但是，如果低估反革命活动所包含的危险，那是错误的。应该在各个方面越来越有力地与反革命活动进行不断地斗争。美帝国主义及其所拥有的一切力量是古巴革命的头号敌人，是反革命活动的策动者，是反革命的盾牌、大本营和武器供应者。帝国主义者一直在攻击革命和革命政府，因为他们知道，这个革命是真正的革命，在他们面前的是决心把古巴革命和拉丁美洲革命推向前进的革命者。帝国主义者现在是反革命的核心。现在最富于侵略性的帝国主义势力直接操纵反革命活动，而把特鲁希略和他们在多米尼加的基地推到了次要地位。古巴一定要继续进行军事准备，以便抵抗一切进攻和帝国主义的干涉。
    但是，罗加指出，帝国主义决不可能靠干涉使我们屈服。帝国主义如果了解这一点，这就有可能使它不敢派军队到这里登陆。因此，古巴人民必须自觉地学会掌握武器，加强工农民兵。
    罗加在谈到古巴最近给美国的关于建议同美国谈判的外交照会时说，我们不仅把美国人民看作兄弟，而且还认为应该建立更加友好和互利的关系。但是，这种关系不能建立在帝国主义攻击我们的基础上。现在该是美国政府表明它的诚意的时候了。
    罗加在谈到美国的经济威胁时指出，如果降低糖的限额，那么他们真正和最后所能得到的唯一的东西，就是使民族反帝情绪更加高涨，而在古巴和全拉丁美洲人民面前自食其果。
    罗加最后谈到了发展党员和建党问题以及保持纯洁和可靠的革命队伍的任务。他在谈到关于所提出的任务时指出，今年我们应该把提高党员的革命觉悟和马克思列宁主义的思想和政治水平作为党内的主要任务。会议已开始讨论第一和第二两项议程的报告。
    一些拉丁美洲国家共产党的著名活动家以来宾身份出席了会议。
