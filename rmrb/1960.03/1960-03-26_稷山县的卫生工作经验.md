Jishan County's Experience in Health Work
Wang Peisha

Since the people's communes were established, Jishan County, Shanxi Province, has achieved significant progress in healthcare. Currently, the county has established a healthcare network that serves the people's communes and is adapted to the organization of production. The four pests have been eliminated, and several major diseases that endanger people's health have been basically eliminated and controlled. People's mental outlook has also undergone profound changes, forming a social ethos of hygiene, cleanliness, and belief in science. Because the broad masses have enhanced their physical fitness, increased labor attendance rates, and strengthened their confidence in overcoming natural disasters, production has been greatly promoted. The whole county presents a prosperous scene of "bumper harvests of grain and longevity for the people."

Jishan County's healthcare work has achieved great success, and the following experiences have been explored and summarized.

Strengthen Party Leadership and Adhere to Putting Politics in Command

In the past few years of practice, leading comrades of the Party committees at all levels in Jishan County have deeply realized the significant role of doing a good job in health in promoting production development. Therefore, they attach great importance to health care work and have indeed strengthened the Party's leadership. They implement a system from the county to the management district, commune, and production team, where the secretary at each level takes the lead, and put health work on the agenda of Party organizations. Party committee secretaries at all levels personally lead the formulation of health plans, convene meetings, and mobilize the masses. In each health campaign, they set an example by taking the lead and joining the masses in battle, giving the masses great encouragement.

The Jishan County Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches particular importance to strengthening the Party's ideological leadership over health work. In 1958, the whole county realized the communization. The Jishan County Committee of the Communist Party of China implemented Chairman Mao's thoughts on continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary stages. According to the development of production and the changes in production relations, through multiple meetings, the county committee pointed out the new situations and new tasks facing health work to the broad masses. The committee educated the masses to recognize that after the people's communes were established, healthcare institutions had become a component of the commune, personnel and funding were more easily arranged in a unified manner, and health and production were more easily and closely combined. At the same time, due to the commune's large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, large-scale establishment of factories, pastures, forest farms, and deep plowing of land, as well as large-scale collective labor and life, and due to the establishment of public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly and other collective welfare undertakings, these not only brought favorable conditions for doing a good job in health work, but also required health care work to keep up accordingly. In particular, labor protection and public health must be placed in a primary position. Through publicity and education, the broad masses further enhanced their understanding, clarified the direction, and laid the foundation for doing a good job in health care after the establishment of the people's communes.

Follow the Mass Line and Launch Mass Movements

In the past few years, Jishan County's health care work has always adhered to the policy of following the mass line and launching mass movements. In the mass movement of health work, Jishan County correctly resolved the relationship between crash campaigns and regular work, and carried out repeated struggles to eliminate pests and diseases. They launched a health campaign month in late winter and early spring, and a health campaign ten-day period before the busy farming season in summer and autumn. They launched health campaign days on or one or two days before New Year's Day, Spring Festival, Lantern Festival, "March 8th" (International Women's Day), "May 1st" (International Labor Day), "July 1st" (CCP Founding Day), Mid-Autumn Festival, and National Day. They also insisted on regular health work at other times. Their arrangement of crash campaigns and regular work was not only based on the agricultural busy and slack seasons, but also targeted the breeding and transmission patterns of diseases and pests. In each crash campaign, new content and new requirements were put forward to the broad masses, rather than repeating the old routine. In this way, doing a good job in the crash campaigns accelerated the improvement of regular work; doing a good job in regular work consolidated and developed the results of the crash campaigns, thereby promoting the continuous improvement and advancement of the mass movement of health work.

The reason why Jishan County's mass movement for health work can fully blossom and achieve a large-scale harvest is that they adopted the working methods of inserting red flags, setting up model soldiers, using points to lead the area, and combining points and area. In every aspect of health work, they focused on cultivating typical examples and establishing model soldiers. Through methods such as organizing the masses to visit typical units and convening on-site meetings, they not only vigorously promoted advanced experiences, but also resolved the ideological problems of the masses and inspired their revolutionary enthusiasm.

Health for Production, Production Pays Attention to Health

Starting from production, combining with production, and serving production is the consistent guiding ideology of Jishan County in carrying out health work.

Jishan County has many measures to combine health and production. In terms of leadership methods, from the county to the production team, the "five unifications" of health and production were implemented (namely, unified planning, unified deployment, unified inspection, unified reporting, and unified evaluation). That is, at the same time as deploying production, the work of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene was deployed and arranged; when inspecting production, the work of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene was inspected; and the work of health was combined when reporting, evaluating, and summarizing production. In this way, the contradictions between health and production were unified. In terms of specific practices, "five combinations" were implemented, that is, rectifying environmental sanitation combined with accumulating fertilizer and managing feces; eliminating rats combined with protecting seeds and grain; doing a good job in labor protection combined with safe production; doing a good job in food hygiene, water source protection and collective hygiene and prevention work, combined with the management of canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens; and doing a good job in household hygiene, combined with recovering waste products and practicing diligence and thrift in managing the household. The work system and methods were also adapted to the production situation and production requirements. For example, the implementation of a collective medical and healthcare system ensures that commune members can receive early treatment when they are sick and early prevention when they are not sick. The methods of hanging signs to report illnesses, doctors visiting the home, and field patrols to see patients at the head of the fields were adopted to ensure the working time of commune members, and so on. Reasonable solutions were also found in terms of time arrangement. Different health work tasks were arranged according to different seasons and different production tasks. For example, combined with spring plowing, summer harvest, and autumn harvest, the work of preventing and controlling infectious diseases and labor protection and field hygiene was deployed; combined with large-scale accumulation of fertilizer, the work of "three clearances" and "ten improvements" was deployed, etc. When arranging time, they adopted the following methods: small-scale work during busy farming seasons, large-scale work during slack farming seasons, cleaning for ten minutes early in the morning, doing household hygiene when it rains, and doing environmental hygiene after rain.

Cultivate Technical Cadres and Carry out Cultural Revolution

The achievements of Jishan County's healthcare work are also the result of the combination of professional health teams and the broad masses, and the result of the combination of the strength of the masses and the strength of science and technology. Jishan County attaches great importance to cultivating technical cadres and activists in health work. In the past few years, more than 15,000 skilled workers in eliminating the four pests have been trained, and more than 42,000 cooks, child care workers, midwives, breeders, barbers, store service personnel, and food processors have been given three to five centralized training sessions. Moreover, graduates of senior primary schools and junior middle schools in the countryside were transferred to training classes held by the county hospital to study. Last year, the county trained more than 120 new medical and nursing personnel. Relying on this group of technical cadres, professional teams, and activists, Jishan County correctly solved the relationship between professional teams and mass movements, and the relationship between scientific and technological forces and mass forces. Relying on this group of technical cadres, the first thing to do is to publicize knowledge about disease prevention and hygiene to the broad masses, and to improve the masses' awareness of hygiene and their level of cultural science and technology. The second is to organize technical instruction and experience exchange, and to provide technical guidance for eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases. At the same time, it is necessary to study the breeding and activity patterns of the four pests and the methods of pest control, summarize the inventions and creations of the masses in the pest control and disease elimination, and also organize the masses to reform the tools for eliminating the four pests, and prepare the pesticides for eliminating the four pests, and so on. In the past few years, Jishan County has summarized many experiences of the masses in eliminating pests and diseases, and after sorting out and researching, it has been raised to the theoretical level, and then handed over to the masses to master, thereby greatly exerting the huge power of science and technology in the pest control and disease elimination movement.

Jishan County has made great achievements in health care work, but they are not satisfied. They have put forward new goals: the four pests are eradicated, people live long and healthy lives, everyone has a high level of hygiene science knowledge and good hygiene habits, every household has bright windows and clean tables, every village is clean, green, beautified, and fragrant, the scenery is pleasant, and medical and health care institutions with modern building equipment and a fairly high level of technology are established.

    稷山县的卫生工作经验
    王培莎
    山西稷山县的卫生保健工作，在人民公社化以后，又获得了巨大的成绩。目前，全县范围内建立了一套为人民公社服务、与生产组织相适应的卫生保健网；歼灭了四害，基本消灭和控制了几种危害人民健康的主要疾病；人们的精神面貌也得到了深刻的改变，形成了讲卫生、爱清洁和信科学的社会风尚。由于广大群众增强了体质，提高了劳动出勤率，坚定了战胜自然灾害的信念，因此大大地促进了生产的发展。全县呈现出“五谷丰登、人寿年丰”的繁荣景象。
    稷山县的卫生保健工作取得了巨大成绩，也摸索和总结出以下几点经验。
    加强党的领导　坚持政治挂帅
    在过去几年的实践中，稷山县的各级党委的领导同志，已经深刻地体会到搞好卫生对促进生产发展的重大作用，因此十分重视卫生保健工作，确实加强了党的领导。他们从县到管理区、公社和生产队都实行层层书记挂帅，把卫生工作列入党组织的议事日程。各级党委书记都亲自领导制订卫生计划，召集会议，动员群众，在历次卫生突击运动中，他们都是以身作则，同群众在一起投入战斗，给群众以很大的鼓舞。
    中共稷山县委特别重视加强党对卫生工作的思想领导。1958年，全县实现了公社化，中共稷山县委贯彻毛主席的不断革命和革命阶段论的思想原则，根据生产的发展和生产关系的变革，通过多次会议，向广大群众指出了卫生工作所面临的新形势和新任务，教育广大群众认识了人民公社化以后，卫生保健机构已经成为公社的组成部分，人员和经费等更便于统一安排，卫生和生产也更便于密切结合；同时，由于公社的大搞水利建设、大办工厂、牧场、林场和深翻土地等大规模的集体劳动和生活，由于举办了公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、妇产院和敬老院等集体福利事业，既给搞好卫生工作带来有利条件，也更要求卫生保健工作相应地跟上去，特别是劳动保护和公共卫生必须放在首要地位。通过宣传教育，使广大群众进一步提高了认识，明确了方向，为人民公社化后搞好卫生保健工作奠定了基础。
    走群众路线　大搞群众运动
    几年来，稷山县的卫生保健工作，始终坚持了走群众路线、大搞群众运动的方针。在卫生工作的群众运动中，稷山县正确地解决了突击运动和经常工作的关系，进行了除害灭病的反复的斗争。他们在冬末春初开展一次卫生突击月，夏秋两季农忙之前各开展一次卫生突击旬，元旦、春节、元宵节、“三八”、“五一”、“七一”、中秋、国庆的当天或前一两天开展卫生突击日，平时还坚持经常性的卫生工作。他们安排突击运动和经常工作，不仅是根据农业忙闲进行的，而且是针对病害繁殖和传播的规律进行的。在每次突击运动中，都向广大群众提出新的内容和新的要求，而不是老一套的循环。这样，搞好突击运动，就使经常工作加速提高；搞好经常工作，又使突击运动的成果得到巩固和发展，从而促使卫生工作的群众运动不断地提高，不断地前进。
    稷山县的卫生工作的群众运动之所以能全面开花，获得大面积丰收，是由于他们采用了插红旗、树标兵、以点带面、点面结合的工作方法。他们在每一个卫生工作方面，都重点培养了典型，树立了标兵。通过组织群众参观典型单位到召开现场会议等方法，既大张旗鼓地推广了先进经验，又解决了群众的思想问题，鼓舞了他们的革命干劲。
    卫生为生产　生产讲卫生
    从生产出发、结合生产、为生产服务，是稷山县开展卫生工作的一贯的指导思想。
    稷山县的卫生和生产相结合的措施是很多的。在领导方法上，从县到生产队，都实行了卫生和生产的“五统一”（即统一计划、统一部署、统一检查、统一汇报、统一评比）。也就是在每次布置生产的同时，布置和安排除四害讲卫生工作；在检查生产时，检查除四害讲卫生工作，在汇报、评比、总结生产时都结合卫生工作，这样便把卫生和生产的矛盾统一起来了。在具体作法上是实行“五结合”，即整顿环境卫生、结合积肥和粪便管理；消灭老鼠，结合保种保粮；做好劳动保护，结合安全生产；做好饮食卫生、水源保护和集体卫生预防工作，结合食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的管理；做好家庭卫生，结合收回废品和勤俭持家。在工作制度和方法上，也使卫生保健工作和生产情况、生产要求相适应。例如，实行集体医疗保健制度，保证社员能够有病早治、无病早防，采取挂签报病医生上门和田间巡回地头看病的办法，保证社员的劳动时间，等等。在时间安排上也得到了合理的解决，根据不同的季节不同的生产任务，布置不同的卫生工作任务，例如，结合春耕和夏收秋收，布置防治传染病和劳动保护、田间卫生的工作；结合大搞积肥，布置“三清除”、“十改良”的工作等。安排时间时，他们采取的方法是：农忙小搞，农闲大搞，早起十分钟清扫，下雨搞家庭卫生，雨后搞环境卫生。
    培养技术干部　进行文化革命
    稷山县的卫生保健工作的成绩，也是专业的卫生队伍和广大群众相结合的结果，是群众的力量和科学技术的力量相结合的结果。稷山县非常重视培养技术干部和卫生工作的积极分子。几年来共培养了一万五千余名除四害的能手，对四万二千多名炊事员、保育员、助产员、饲养员、理发员、商店服务员和食品加工人员等都进行了三至五次的集中训练。而且还抽调在乡的高小和初中毕业生到县医院举办的训练班学习。去年，全县培养了一百二十多名新的医务、护理人员。稷山县依靠这批技术干部、专业队伍和积极分子，正确地解决了专业队伍和群众运动、科学技术力量和群众力量相结合的关系问题。依靠这批技术干部，首先是向广大群众宣传预防疾病、讲究卫生的知识，提高群众的卫生自觉性和文化科学技术水平。其次是组织技术传授和经验交流，对除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病进行技术指导。同时，研究四害的繁殖活动规律和除害方法，总结群众在除害灭病中的发明创造，还要组织群众改革除四害的工具，配制除四害的药剂，等等。几年来，稷山县已经总结了群众很多的除害灭病的经验，并经过整理研究提高到理论上来，然后再交给群众掌握，从而，大大发挥了科学技术在除害灭病运动中的巨大力量。
    稷山县的卫生保健工作取得了很大成绩，但是，他们并不满足，他们提出了新的目标：四害灭绝、人寿年丰，人人有较高的卫生科学知识和良好的卫生习惯，户户窗明几净，村村整洁、绿化、美化、香化，风景宜人，建立有现代化建筑设备和相当高级的技术水平的医疗保健机构。
