Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 23rd: Rangoon newspapers continue to welcome the agreement signed between China and Nepal regarding the border issue between the two countries.

    The evening newspaper "New Rangoon Daily" said in an article entitled "Another Brilliant Example" that the Sino-Nepalese border agreement, signed after the conclusion of the Sino-Burmese border agreement, once again demonstrates that countries with different social systems can resolve all historically inherited problems through peaceful negotiations. This is a shining example for those countries that have problems with each other that have not yet been resolved.
    The article emphasized that the clamor of slandering China for "invading Nepalese territory" can cease. The Sino-Nepalese border agreement proves that China will never and does not need to "invade" neighboring countries. What China needs is to coexist peacefully and equally with its neighbors.
    "Reporter" newspaper published an editorial saying that the signing of the Sino-Nepalese border agreement is the second auspicious event following the signing of the Sino-Burmese border agreement. It should be said that this is very satisfying.
    The editorial said that if the border issue between India and China is also resolved, it will be the third auspicious event.

    缅甸报纸发表评论说
    中尼签订协定是吉祥的大事
    新华社仰光23日电　仰光报纸继续欢迎中国和尼泊尔签订的关于两国边界问题的协定。
    晚报“新仰光报”在题为“另一个辉煌的范例”的文章中说，继缔结中缅边界协定后签订的中尼边境协定再一次表明，不同社会制度的国家可以通过和平谈判来解决历史上遗留下来的一切问题。对于那些彼此有问题还没有得到解决的国家来说，这是一个光辉的范例。
    文章着重指出，诬蔑中国“侵入尼泊尔领土”的这种叫嚣可以休矣，中尼边界协定证明，中国决不会也不需要“侵略”邻国，中国需要的是同邻国和平与平等地共处。
    “记者报”发表社论说，中尼边界协定的签订，是继中缅边境协定签定以后的第二件吉祥的大事。应当说，这是令人十分满意的。
    社论说，如果印度和中国的边界问题也解决了，这将是第三件吉祥的大事。
