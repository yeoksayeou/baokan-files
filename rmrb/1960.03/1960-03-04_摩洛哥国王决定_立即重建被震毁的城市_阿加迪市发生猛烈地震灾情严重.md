Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Rabat dispatch: Moroccan King Mohammed V decided at a cabinet meeting on the 1st to immediately rebuild the city and port of Agadir in southwestern Morocco, which was destroyed by the major earthquake, and appointed a committee headed by Crown Prince Hassan to be responsible for this work.

The major earthquake in Agadir City on the 1st destroyed a large number of buildings in the city. In this city of about 50,000 residents, the number of homeless people is between 35,000 and 40,000. There are no official statistics on the number of dead and injured. News reports estimate that the death toll has reached 5,000 to 6,000 by the 3rd.

The Moroccan King has ordered national mobilization for assistance and declared a national mourning period.

Since the news of the Agadir earthquake spread, many countries have sent telegrams to Morocco to express their condolences and sympathy, and some countries have also donated relief supplies and funds.

The League of Red Cross Societies issued an urgent appeal to its members on the 2nd, requesting them to provide ten more surgeons and twenty nurses for the victims of the Agadir earthquake. This appeal was made at the request of the Moroccan Red Crescent Society.

Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd, Rabat dispatch: A severe earthquake occurred in the port of Agadir, southwestern Morocco, at approximately 1:00 AM local time on the 1st, causing significant casualties and property damage.

The port of Agadir, located 250 miles southwest of Casablanca, is a Moroccan center for fisheries, canned food manufacturing, and tourism.

According to a telegram sent by the Moroccan naval authorities from the disaster-stricken city on the same day, about 90% of the buildings in the city's suburbs and about 70% of the buildings in the city's commercial district were destroyed. News also said that the earthquake had damaged the roads leading to the city, and the city's transportation had been almost completely cut off, and telephone lines were also destroyed. After the earthquake, tidal waves flooded the city.

Never before has there been such a large earthquake in Morocco. Officials at the Rabat earthquake station said that the intensity of this earthquake was equivalent to the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755, which killed at least 15,000 people.

The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces have mobilized more than thirty aircraft to transport victims since the earthquake occurred. Twelve planes carrying medical personnel and medicines left Rabat and Casablanca for Agadir City on the 1st.

On the morning of the 1st, Moroccan King Mohammed V and Crown Prince Hassan visited the scene of the incident. Crown Prince Hassan appealed for international support.

    立即重建被震毁的城市
    阿加迪市发生猛烈地震灾情严重
    新华社3日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世1日在内阁会议上决定，立即重建被大地震震毁了的摩洛哥西南部的阿加迪城和港口，并且任命了一个由王储哈桑领导的委员会来负责这项工作。
    阿加迪城1日发生的大地震使这个城市的大量建筑物都被震毁。在这个约有居民五万人的城市里，无家可归的人数在三万五千到四万人之间。死伤的人数还没有正式的统计。有消息说，估计死亡的人数在3日已经达到五、六千人。
    摩洛哥国王已经命令摩洛哥全国动员，进行援助，并且下令全国致哀。
    自从阿加迪地震消息传出以来，许多国家纷纷打电报给摩洛哥表示慰问和哀悼，有些国家还捐助了救济品和救济金。
    红十字会协会2日向它的会员发出紧急呼吁，要求它们再为阿加迪地震的受害者提供十名外科医生和二十名护士。这项呼吁是根据摩洛哥红新月会的要求而发出的。
    新华社2日讯　拉巴特讯：摩洛哥西南部阿加迪港在1日清晨当地时间一时左右发生猛烈地震。造成重大的人员伤亡和财产损失。
    阿加迪港位于卡萨布兰卡西南二百五十英里的地方，是摩洛哥一个渔业和罐头食品制造业中心和游览地。
    据摩洛哥海军当局当天从这个受灾的城市发出的电报说，这个城市郊区约90％的建筑物和城市繁华区约70％的建筑物被毁。还有消息说，地震把通往市区的公路都震坏了，这个城市的交通几乎已被切断，电话也被震毁。在地震之后，海潮又涌入这个城市。
    在摩洛哥，还从来没有发生过这样大的地震。拉巴特地震站的负责人员说，这次地震的猛烈程度，相当于至少死了一万五千人的里斯本1755年的大地震。
    摩洛哥皇家武装部队在地震发生后已调动三十几架飞机负责抢运受害者。十二架运载医务人员和药品的飞机在1日已经离开拉巴特和卡萨布兰卡飞往阿加迪城。
    1日上午，摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世和王储哈桑曾前往出事地点。哈桑王储呼吁各国支援。
