Friendship Fills the Valley
Gao Liang

Chinese guests who have visited Nepal all have this deep impression: the Nepalese people are simple, hardworking, hospitable, and enthusiastic. Their sincere and profound friendship towards the Chinese people is difficult to describe in words.

The beautiful Kathmandu Valley is itself a beautiful poem. The Himalayan snow mountains use their fresh milk to irrigate the valley's crops, grasslands, and forests. Fragrant and colorful flowers, graceful and charming, bloom all over the valley. Nepalese people often use these flowers to express their respect and friendship to their guests. When reporters visited Kathmandu not long ago, two enthusiastic young people brought several bunches of fragrant "fan-shaped flowers" to our residence every morning, quietly placing them in front of our windows and on our tables, to express their love for Chinese friends.

"China Flower" and "China Queen"

Just as flowers bloom everywhere, symbols of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people can be found everywhere in the actual lives and feelings of the Nepalese people. Nepal has a most beautiful flower called "China Flower." Nepalese girls universally love to adopt the beautiful name "China Queen." The houses inhabited by Nepalese people are generally installed with exquisitely carved and beautiful louvred windows, which they call "Tibetan Windows." The style of these louvred windows is somewhat similar to those in Tibet. People look out the window and it is as if they can see the Tibetan Plateau of China across the mountains, and they will immediately think of how close China and Nepal are as neighbors.

Cultural Exchange Historical Sites are Everywhere

The clear spring of Sino-Nepalese cultural exchanges has flowed through the riverbed of thousands of years of history. The world-renowned ancient Nepalese architecture is magnificent and brilliant, and is a glittering gem of Nepalese culture. In the magnificent temples of the ancient cities of Patan and Bhaktapur, there are many pagoda-style buildings that are familiar and loved by the Chinese. Their complex structure and exquisitely refined carvings fully demonstrate the artistic genius of the Nepalese working people. According to historical records, the Chinese pagoda-style architecture was introduced to China in ancient times by famous Nepalese craftsmen; and on the thresholds of Nepalese temples and residences, it is common to see carved dragons, coiling and dancing. According to records, these were introduced to Nepal from China.

In Kathmandu, I visited Mr. Sama, a famous Nepalese poet and academician of the Royal Academy of Literature. He is good at poetry, painting, and drama, and integrates them together in his works. He loves the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, translated several of Du Fu's poems into Nepali, and painted Du Fu's image using traditional Chinese painting techniques. He greatly admires Qi Baishi's paintings and Guo Moruo's historical dramas. He told me that he would organize a performance of the Chinese historical drama "Qu Yuan" in Nepali. At a banquet in Kathmandu, we also met an old Nepalese man. He is a doctor and is already seventy-three years old. He visited China several years ago and brought back many Chinese medicine prescriptions and herbs from Beijing, combining Chinese medicine treatment methods with traditional Nepalese medicine to treat patients. Therefore, people call him "Chinese Doctor."

The Chinese and Nepalese People are Good Brothers

The Chinese Photo, Art, and Handicraft Exhibition and "Chinese Film Week" held in Kathmandu last October aroused the interest of the leaders and people from all walks of life in the Kingdom of Nepal. Among the thousands of daily visitors, many enthusiastically wrote inscriptions on the souvenir book expressing their wishes and confidence in continuously strengthening Sino-Nepalese friendly relations and economic and cultural cooperation. At this exhibition, we met a farmer from the outskirts of Kathmandu who brought his young son, who was attending primary school, to visit. After the visit, he asked his young son to write on the exhibition's souvenir book: "The Chinese and Nepalese people are good brothers!"

Now, it is the beautiful time of the third month of the Chinese lunar calendar, and Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala is carrying the friendship of the Nepalese people to the Chinese people on a friendly visit to China. It is believed that when Prime Minister Koirala returns to Kathmandu, he will bring back the sincere and affectionate friendship of the Chinese people to the Nepalese people. (Attached picture)

    友情满山谷
    高梁
    访问过尼泊尔的中国客人，都有这样深刻的印象：尼泊尔人民朴实勤劳，好客热情，他们对中国人民真挚深厚的友谊，是很难用语言来形容的。
    幽美的加德满都山谷，本身就是一首美丽的诗。喜马拉雅雪山用它清新的乳液，灌溉山谷的庄稼、草原和森林。奇香鲜艳的花朵，婀娜多姿，开满山谷。尼泊尔人常用这些鲜花表达他们对客人的尊敬和友情。当记者不久前在加德满都访问时，两位热情的青年，每天清晨都把几束奇香扑鼻的“扇形花”带到我们的住处，静悄悄地放在我们的窗前和桌上，表示他们对中国朋友的友爱。
    “中国之花”和“中国皇后”
    正像是鲜花处处开一样，在尼泊尔人民的实际生活和感情中，到处都可以发现中、尼两国人民传统友谊的象征。尼泊尔有一种最美丽的花，叫“中国之花”。尼泊尔的姑娘，普遍爱起“中国皇后”这个好听的名字。尼泊尔人居住的房屋，一般都安装着精雕细琢的美观的楼窗，他们称它为“西藏之窗”。这种楼窗的式样同西藏的有些类似。人们推窗远眺，心目中就像是隔山看到了中国的西藏高原，顿时就会联想到中国和尼泊尔是多么亲近的邻邦。
    文化交流史迹触目皆是
    在千百年历史的河床上流过中尼文化交往的清泉。驰名于世的尼泊尔古代建筑，壮丽辉煌，是尼泊尔文化的晶莹宝石。在巴丹古城和巴特岗的壮丽的庙宇中，有许多为中国人熟悉和喜爱的高塔式建筑。它们的复杂的结构、美丽精致的雕琢，充分地显示了尼泊尔劳动人民的艺术天才。据历史记载，中国的塔式建筑就是由尼泊尔著名的匠人在古代传到中国的；而在尼泊尔的庙宇和住宅的门槛上，常见有雕刻的龙，盘旋飞舞，据记载，这是从中国传入尼泊尔的。
    在加德满都，我曾拜访过尼泊尔著名的诗人、皇家文学院文学士萨马先生。他善长诗、绘画和戏剧，并在著作中把它们融化在一起。他酷爱李白和杜甫的诗篇，他把杜甫的几首诗译成了尼泊尔文，并用中国国画的传统画笔，绘出杜甫的形象。他十分欣赏齐白石的画和郭沫若的历史剧。他告诉我，他将要组织用尼泊尔文演出中国的历史剧“屈原”。在加德满都的一次宴会上，我们还会见过一位尼泊尔的老人。他是医生，已经是七十三岁了。几年前他曾访问过中国，他从北京带回许多中医的处方和草药，把中医的治疗方法同尼泊尔的传统医术结合起来，给病人治病。因此，人们都称呼他为“中国医生”。
    中尼人民是好兄弟
    去年10月间在加德满都举行的中国图片、美术和手工艺品展览会和“中国电影周”，曾引起尼泊尔王国的领导人和各界人士的兴趣。在每天成千的观众中，许多人热情洋溢地在留念本上题字表示他们对不断加强中尼友好关系和经济文化合作的愿望和信心。我们在这个展览会上曾遇到过一位来自加德满都近郊的农民，他带着正在小学里上学的小儿子前来参观。在参观以后，他叫他的小儿子在展览会的留念簿上写道：“中尼人民是好兄弟！”
    现在，正是中国阳春三月的美好时光，尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊带着尼泊尔人民对中国人民的友情到中国进行友好访问。人们相信，当柯伊拉腊首相返回加德满都的时候，他将要带回去中国人民对尼泊尔人民的真诚而亲切的友情。（附图片）
