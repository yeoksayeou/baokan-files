　　Preparing for plowing should be early, sowing should be early, preparing summer harvest tools should be early, and all work should be carried out appropriately in advance. Because early preparation and early action allow us to seize the initiative and do the work more carefully. As early as two months ago, Qihe County in Shandong Province began preparing summer harvest tools, so the repair and manufacturing of summer harvest tools was done very well. Among them, more than 16,000 pieces of semi-mechanized tools were manufactured alone, and there are plans to match various tools for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and storage.
　　The preparation of summer harvest tools can be completed as early as possible because it is different from sowing and harvesting. Sowing can be done early, but if it is too early, the soil temperature and climate are not suitable for seed germination and growth. Harvesting can be done early, but if it is too early, the crops will not be fully mature, which will inevitably reduce the harvest. The preparation of tools is different from these tasks and is not restricted by natural conditions. As long as there is strength, preparation can begin in early winter. The agricultural tools used in the communes now are different from before, especially since a technical transformation movement is underway in various places. The tools used are not only increasing in quantity, but also changing in specifications. In addition to the original farm tools, various places must also add some more complex improved farm tools and semi-mechanized tools. Among these newly added tools, some are imitations, some need to be modified, and some are yet to be created. Therefore, the preparation of agricultural tools includes not only the production process, but also the process of testing and identification, as well as the process of rework and reconstruction. If we don't start early and don't strive for more time, how can we complete such a complex and arduous task? In particular, attention should also be paid to the matching of tools. If this work is not done well, the harvesting, transportation, threshing and other tools will not be able to adapt to each other, and during the summer harvest process, there will inevitably be a phenomenon of tools waiting for people and people waiting for tools. This will neither give full play to the effectiveness of the tools, nor will it solve the contradiction of insufficient labor. Even because the various processes are not connected, such as harvesting without timely transportation, and transportation without timely threshing, it is easy to cause losses due to spillage and mildew. All these problems must be paid attention to and solved when preparing summer harvest tools.
　　In the preparation of summer harvest tools, the close cooperation of all relevant departments is very important. In the past two years, the support of industrial and commercial departments for agriculture has played a significant role. In addition to continuing to organize the source of goods to ensure supply, these departments should also go deep into the countryside to deliver various application materials to the door and repair and equip tools for the countryside. The People's Commune should give full play to its own strength, on the one hand, organize iron and wood workers to overhaul the original large and small tools, and on the other hand, mobilize the staff of farm tool factories and machinery factories to mass-produce and imitate some new farm tools and semi-mechanized tools according to local characteristics. Starting early and working together, it is possible to prepare all the necessary tools before the start of the summer harvest, to meet the tools needed for a bumper summer harvest.

    早准备，争主动
    张克
    备耕要早，播种要早，准备夏收工具要早，一切工作都应适当地提前进行。因为早准备，早动手，才可以争取主动，把工作做得更加细致。山东齐河县早在两个月以前就动手准备夏收工具，所以夏收工具的修理制造工作做得很好，其中单是半机械化工具就制造了一万六千多件，并且计划把收割、运输、脱粒、入仓等各种工具进行配套。
    夏收工具的准备工作，是尽量可以提前完成的，因为它不同于播种和收割。播种可以提早，但如果太早，地温和气候都不适宜种子的发芽、生长。收获可以提早，但如太早了，庄稼没有完全成熟，势必减少收成。而工具的准备，和这些工作不同，不受自然条件的限制，只要有力量，在前冬就可以开始准备。现在公社里使用的农具和从前不同了，尤其目前各地正进行着技术改造运动。使用的工具不仅数量有所增加，规格也在发生变化。各地除原有农具外，还要添置一些比较复杂的改良农具和半机械化工具。在这些新添工具中，有的是仿制，有的要修改，有的还有待创造。因而在农具准备过程中，既包括生产的过程，也包括试验鉴定的过程，还包括返工重造的过程。如果不及早动手，不争取更多的时间，怎么能完成这样复杂而又艰巨的任务呢？特别是还要注意工具的配套工作。这一项工作做得不好，收割、运输、脱粒等工具不能互相适应，在夏收过程中就必然会出现工具等人和人等工具的窝工现象，既不能充分发挥工具的效能，也不能解决劳力不足的矛盾。甚至因各个过程互不衔接，如收了不能及时运，运了不能及时脱粒，还容易造成抛撒霉烂的损失。所有这些问题，都要在准备夏收工具时就注意解决。
    在夏收工具的准备工作中，各有关部门的密切配合非常重要。近两年来，工业和商业部门对农业的支援有很大作用。这些部门除应当继续组织货源保证供应外，还要深入农村把各种应用物资送到门上和为农村修配工具。人民公社则应当充分发挥本身的力量，一面组织铁木工人对原有大小工具进行检修，一面根据当地特点发动农具厂、机械厂的职工大量试制和仿制一些新式农具和半机械化工具。及早动手，通力协作，就有可能争取在夏收开始以前，把需要的各种工具准备齐全，满足夏季大丰收所需要的工具。
