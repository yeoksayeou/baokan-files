    The anniversary of the founding of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is today. The German people and all officers and soldiers of the National People's Army celebrate this day every year as a symbol of their determination to defend their country. In the past few years, the National People's Army has grown into a reliable armed force to defend the first worker-peasant state in Germany. It is the first truly people's army in Germany, a sharp sword in the hands of the working class. It maintains a high degree of vigilance at all times, defending the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic, and striving to defend European and world peace.

    德国工农军队的节日
    今天是德意志民主共和国国家人民军建军四周年节日。德国人民和国家人民军全体官兵每年都把这一天当作卫国决心的象征来庆祝。在过去的几年里，国家人民军已成长为一支保卫德国第一个工农国家的可靠的武装力量。它是德国第一支真正的人民子弟兵，是一把掌握在工人阶级手中的利剑。它时刻都保持着高度的警惕性，保卫着德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业，并为保卫欧洲和世界和平而努力。
