    Two Ideologies, Two Kinds of People
    Wang Fuyu, Beijing Jianguomen East Biaobei Hutong Kindergarten
    "A riot of color always heralds the spring" portrays various typical female characters participating in production. Under the Party's education, people's spiritual outlook is changing greatly. Gui Zhen is a typical virtuous wife and good mother of the old society. With the help of the Party's education and the masses, she recognizes the meaning of life, understands the relationship between women and socialist construction, becomes strong, breaks through the shackles of the small family, and embarks on a production post. Gui Zhen and Cai Feng's husbands have completely different attitudes towards their wives' participation in production. The film clearly praises Cai Feng's husband, an advanced worker, who actively supports his wife's participation in production, and criticizes Gui Zhen's husband, who has a male chauvinist ideology. That selfish, self-centered intellectual, under the education of facts, also sees the strength of the women's masses, and finally changes his attitude and establishes an equal and mutually respectful relationship with his wife. This is a good education for people with this kind of old ideological consciousness.

    两种思想两种人
    北京建国门东裱背胡同幼儿园　王父玉
    “万紫千红总是春”表现了家庭妇女参加生产中，各个不同的典型人物。在党的教育下，人们的精神面貌正大大改变。桂贞是典型的旧社会的贤妻良母，在党的教育和群众的帮助下，认识了生活的意义，懂得了妇女与建设社会主义的关系，坚强起来，突破了小家庭的束缚，走上了生产岗位。在对待自己爱人参加生产的问题上，桂贞和彩凤的爱人所持的态度是截然不同的。影片很鲜明地颂扬了积极支持爱人参加生产的彩凤的爱人——一位先进工人，批判了有着大男子主义思想的桂贞的爱人。那个自私自利，唯我独尊的知识分子，在事实的教育下，也看到了妇女群众的力量，终于改变了态度，和爱人建立了平等互敬的关系。这对于有这种旧思想意识的人，是个很好的教育。
