    In Memory of a Friend Far Away
    Ai Zhongxin
    At the German Democratic Republic's 10th Anniversary Art Exhibition, many excellent oil paintings, prints, and sculptures carried my thoughts to a distant place thousands of miles away. In the spring and summer of 1956, I visited the banks of the Elbe, from Dresden to Rügen Island. I visited many cities and villages, where I met many friends.

    The author of "Brühl Street," the oil painter B. Kretzschmar, is one of the most well-known landscape painters in the German Democratic Republic. We are old friends who met in Beijing. When I visited the Dresden Art School, he was returning from painting on the banks of the Elbe, with a drawing board under his arm, a paint box in his hand, and an easel on his shoulder. This energetic, white-haired old man loves his country, the Elbe, the hills and wheat fields of the Dresden suburbs, and the thriving scene of the German Democratic Republic. At the Socialist Countries Fine Arts Exhibition held in Moscow the year before last, his new work "Stalin Steel Base" was highly praised. This painting vividly reflects the spirit of a new socialist city rising from the ground. The author reflects on the canvas a heartfelt joy for the industrial construction of the motherland. Like "Brühl Street" that we see now, it is filled with the uplifting emotions of the socialist construction era, which is in line with the principle of "combining art with the new life" advocated by the party and government of the German Democratic Republic.

    R. Behrend is one of the most prestigious oil painters in Germany. The images of workers he portrays are deeply loved by the German people. The outstanding artists of the German Democratic Republic use their creations to express the lives of the working people from different perspectives, closely integrating art with the lives of the people; at the same time, they have made many efforts to explore how art forms can perfectly reflect life. Painter Behrend's oil painting "Assembly," lithograph "Festival," and etching "Female Construction Worker" are all representative works embodying this artistic direction. In the German Democratic Republic, painters go to factories and rural areas for short periods, or sign long-term contracts with farms, to live and create among the working people. This is a powerful measure to align the emotions of artists with the people and to deeply reflect life in their works. Comrade F. Noll, chairman of the Dresden Artists Association and an oil painter, excitedly talked about his new plan that started in the 1960s when he visited our country last year. This plan is very similar to our country's method of sending writers and artists to the countryside to settle down. Painter Noll has signed a contract with an agricultural cooperative, where he will work as a member. When I admired his painting "Tractor Driver at Rest" at this exhibition, I had a vision of painter Noll living in the agricultural cooperative. Life is the only source of artistic creation, and a bountiful harvest of future creations by the artists of the German Democratic Republic can be expected.

    Many oil painters, sculptors, and printmakers who have visited our country have a number of works in this exhibition. Some depict the friendship between the Chinese and German people (H. Rohma's "Friendship"), some depict the suffering of the Chinese people in Taiwan (B. Hehler's "Taiwan"), and some exhibit sketches made during their visit to China. Our two countries are new brothers born in the same year and the same month. One of us is in the east, and the other is in the west, standing on the front line against imperialism and aggression. As Prime Minister Grotewohl said: "In the struggle against aggression, the German people stand firmly on the side of the Chinese people." Because the cause of socialism and communism is our common ideal.

    I recall that moment in the studio of the painter Grundig and his wife... H. Grundig suffered from persecution by the fascists for a long time from 1936 until the demise of Hitler. The inhuman life in the concentration camp seriously damaged his health. When I was in the German Democratic Republic, he was recuperating. The many prints they created with the theme of anti-fascism show their vigorous fighting will and creativity. His wife, L. Grundig, presented her new works "Bouquet," "Autumn," and "Harvest" to our country's exhibition. We can see the bright scenery of socialist countries, and the dark world under the fascist iron heel is such a strong contrast.

    Among many excellent print works, the woodcut series "Algerians" (by painter K. Miller) is cherished by the Chinese people. We express our deep sympathy and support for the Algerian people's struggle for national independence and liberation. It is undoubtedly a noble manifestation of internationalist spirit for German artists to use art to reflect the anti-colonial national liberation movement.

    Another set of woodcut series "Ten Commandments of Socialist Morality" (by female painter G.M. Dähne) expresses the noble spirit of communist international solidarity, defending the worker-peasant regime and labor discipline in a style familiar to the German people. This form is conducive to promoting communist morality among the people. Female painter Dähne's creative conception and artistic treatment have reached a high level of achievement.

    When I went to Buchenwald, the monument was still being designed. Now I see the portraits made by F. Kremer for this monument. Kremer is an outstanding sculptor in the German Democratic Republic. His works are deeply emotional and simple in technique. This group portrait of three people also embodies his artistic characteristics. The calmness, firmness, and unyielding spirit of these three victims are expressed in a pure sculptural language. In these figures, we can appreciate the revolutionary spirit of heroic struggle hidden in their hearts. Painter E. Jazefski has many excellent works in this exhibition, such as "On the Banks of the Sukbe River" and the novel illustrations for "Tamara." From composition to figures and beasts, he has created a complete set of perfect images.

    There are many excellent works in the exhibition. J. Hagenbarth, an old painter who uses oil paint dipped in charcoal, exhibited three mature sketches including his "Circus Performance." Sculptor H. Drake, who is known for animal sculptures, exhibited "Standing Girl." I am very happy to see the work "Watz in Construction" by Weimar printmaker O. Pech. He handled the composition of the construction landscape powerfully. The "Friendship" created by printmaker K. Siemenmann, which shows the comradely love between the Soviet Red Army and the workers of the German Democratic Republic working together, creates two distinct and vivid typical images. In addition, many young painters' works appeared in the exhibition, showing the growth of the strength of the new generation. This reminds me of the Academy of Fine Arts (Science) in Berlin and several art schools in Dresden, Mecklenburg, Halle, and other places. This exhibition has already shown their great artistic achievements over the past ten years. The oil paintings, sculptures, and prints of the German Democratic Republic have a long and excellent national tradition. Along the road of "combining art with the new life," we believe that the close connection between German artists and the people will surely continue to create newer and more beautiful pictures.

    怀念远方的朋友
    艾中信
    在德意志民主共和国建国十周年艺术展览会上，许多优秀的油画、版画和雕塑作品，把我的思想带到了千万里外的远方。1956年春夏之交，我曾到过易北河滨，从德累斯顿到旅根岛，我访问过许多城市和乡村，在那里结识了很多朋友。
    “布吕尔街”的作者，油画家B·克雷茨许玛是德意志民主共和国最知名的风景画家。我们是在北京相识的老朋友。当我去德累斯顿美术学校访问时，他手里挟着画版、提着画箱，肩上背着画架正从易北河滨作画回来。这位富有青春朝气的白发老人热爱祖国，热爱易北河，热爱德累斯顿郊区的丘陵麦田，热爱德意志民主共和国欣欣向荣的景象。前年在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家造型艺术展览会上，他的新作“斯大林钢铁基地”一画得到很高的评价。这幅画鲜明地反映了一个新兴的社会主义城市平地而起的气魄。作者在画面上反映了对祖国工业建设的由衷的喜悦。像我们现在看到的“布吕尔街”一样，这里洋溢着社会主义建设时代精神振奋的情感，这是符合德意志民主共和国党和政府所号召的“艺术与新生活相结合”的原则的。
    R·贝甘德是德国最有声望的油画家之一，他所描绘的劳动者形像，深为德国人民所喜爱。德意志民主共和国的优秀的艺术家从不同的角度用他们的创作来表现劳动人民的生活，使艺术和人民生活密切结合；同时，对艺术形式如何完美地反映生活的探索作了很多努力。画家贝甘德的油画“集合”、石版画“节日”、腐蚀版画“女建筑工”都是体现这个艺术方向的代表作。在德意志民主共和国，画家们短期的到工厂、农村，或者和农场订立长期的合同，在劳动人民中生活，进行创作，这是使美术家和人民感情相一致以及使作品深刻反映生活的一项有力措施。德累斯顿美协主席、油画家F·诺尔德同志去年访问我国时兴奋地谈到他在六十年代开始的新计划，这个计划和我国文学家、艺术家下乡落户的办法很相似。画家诺尔德和一个农业合作社订了合同，他将作为一个社员在那里工作。当我在这个展览会上欣赏他的“休息中的拖拉机手”一画时，在我的幻觉里出现了画家诺尔德在农业社生活的情景。生活是艺术创作唯一的源泉，德意志民主共和国美术家们未来的创作大丰收是可以预期的。
    曾经访问过我国的油画家、雕塑家、版画家在这次展览会上都有不少作品，有的描绘了中德人民的友谊（H·罗玛的“友谊”），有的描绘了在台湾的中国人民所受的痛苦（B·海勒尔的“台湾”），有的展出了在中国访问期间的写生。我们两国是同年同月生的新兄弟。我们一个在东、一个在西，站在反帝反侵略的最前线。诚如格罗提渥总理说的：“在反侵略斗争中，德国人民坚定地站在中国人民一边。”因为社会主义、共产主义事业是我们共同的理想。
    我回忆起在画家葛龙蒂希夫妇的工作室的那个时刻……H·葛龙蒂希从1936年起一直到希特勒的灭亡，长时期的受着法西斯的迫害。集中营的非人生活严重地残害了他的健康。我在德意志民主共和国的时候，他正在疗养中。他们所创作的以反法西斯为主题的很多版画，显示了他们旺盛的斗争意志和创作力。他的夫人L·葛龙蒂希以她的新作“花束”、“秋天”、“收获”来我国展览，我们可以看到社会主义国家的明媚风光，和法西斯铁蹄下的黑暗世界是多末强烈的对比。
    在很多优秀的版画作品中，木刻组画“阿尔及利亚人”（画家K·米勒作）受到中国人民的珍视，我们对阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立解放的斗争寄予深切的同情和支援，德国美术家用艺术来反映反殖民主义的民族解放运动无疑是国际主义精神的崇高表现。
    另一套木刻组画“社会主义道德十诫”（女画家G·M·丹尼维茨作）把共产主义的国际团结、保卫工农政权和劳动纪律等高尚的精神用德国人民所熟悉的体裁表达出来，这种形式有利于在人民中宣传共产主义道德。女画家丹尼维茨的创作构思和艺术处理都达到了很高的成就。
    我到布亨瓦尔特时还正在设计中的纪念碑，现在我看到了F·克雷默尔为这座纪念碑所作的人像。克雷默尔是德意志民主共和国杰出的雕塑家，他的作品感情深厚，而手法简洁。这座三人的群像也正体现了他的艺术特点。这三个受难者的沉着、坚定、宁死不屈的气概，是用纯朴的雕塑语言表达出来的，在这些人物身上，我们能体会到蕴藏在人物内心的英勇斗争的革命精神。画家E·牙采夫斯基，在这次展览会上有不少优秀的作品，如“在苏克贝河边”和“塔玛拉”的小说插图，从构图到人物、走兽，他创造了一整套完美的形像。
    展览中的佳作很多，以油画笔蘸炭墨作画的J·海根巴脱老画家这次展出了他的“马戏表演”等三幅纯熟的素描。以动物雕刻见长的雕塑家H·德拉克这次展出了“挺立的少女”。我很高兴地看到威玛版画家O·派茨的作品“建设中的瓦茨”，他处理建设风景的构图很有力。版画家K·西门曼所创作的“友谊”，表现苏联红军和德意志民主共和国的工人一起劳动中的同志友爱，创造了两个鲜明生动的典型形像。此外，在展览会上还出现了不少青年画家的作品，显示了新生一代的力量的成长。这使我想起在柏林美术（科学）院和德累斯顿、麦克特堡、哈莱等地的几所美术学校。这次展览已经看到他们十年来艺术上的伟大成就。德意志民主共和国的油画、雕塑、版画都有悠久的、优秀的民族传统，沿着“艺术与新生活相结合”的道路，我们相信德国的美术家和人民的密切联系中一定会不断创造出更新更美的图画。
