    The struggle against the makers of the "Cold War" must be resolute
    Wu Qian
    U.S. imperialism has always been one to speak sweet words but do evil deeds. They are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality on the surface, but their hearts are full of bad intentions. They outwardly display the banner of "peace," but in reality, they have never stopped creating the "Cold War." This was the case in the past, and it is the case now.
    On June 23, 1954, the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" was attacked in the sea south of Taiwan and hijacked to Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan. All the crew members were imprisoned in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's prisons for thirteen months. During these thirteen months, the enemy exhausted all their shameless tricks, trying to make the Soviet sailors betray their motherland, but they got nothing. This incident itself once again exposed the piratical face of U.S. imperialism. As the "Pravda" pointed out in an article at the time: "This illegal action is not accidental, but part of a policy deliberately pursued by the U.S. authorities."
    The Soviet film "Extraordinary Incident" truthfully records this world-shaking event, allowing people all over the world to once again see the shameless faces and robber-like acts of these "Cold War" makers. The U.S. officialdom once denied the crime of hijacking the "Tuapse," but the evidence is irrefutable, how could they deny it? This happened on the sea controlled by the U.S. Navy. The American newspaper columnist Drew Pearson also admitted that before the "Tuapse" oil tanker was detained, a U.S. Navy seaplane had circled over it for a long time, indicating the position of the Soviet oil tanker to the Chiang Kai-shek pirate ships performing the interception mission. Seizing a Soviet oil tanker was just one move in the "Cold War" activities of U.S. imperialism. Isn't it clear what that U.S. imperialism's running dog said in the film? "This is the Cold War, others invented this war, they believe in its power and necessity. We execute their will."
    A fierce and acute struggle is unfolding before us. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are using all kinds of means: threatening with death and hunger, enticing with money and beautiful women, saying to each isolated person: "Everyone has signed the application to refuse to return to Russia, now you are the only one left!" "Your political commissar is driving around in his own car."... They even sent a traitor from the United States who sold his soul to conduct shameless "lobbying" of each crew member in turn, day after day. The purpose was simply this: to make this group of Soviet sailors betray their motherland. U.S. imperialists vainly hoped to add some "Cold War" capital from this bet.
    However, they bet on the wrong "treasure." In front of them were not spineless people, not the dregs who are easily bought, but unyielding Soviet people, ordinary but great people cultivated and educated by the Soviet Communist Party. Some of them are Communist Party members, and some are non-Party masses. Everyone has their own personality characteristics and their own shortcomings, but one thing is common, and that is their loyalty to the socialist motherland. When they faced a serious test, they were all excellent. They endured all kinds of cruel tortures and always raised their heads to answer the enemy with "No!" All the conspiracies and tricks of the Cold War makers are worthless in front of this group of tough guys.
    During the thirteen months of illegal imprisonment, they never stopped waging a resolute struggle against the enemy. The film portrays a series of unforgettable images: First Mate Gavrilenko is calm and decisive, constantly analyzing the enemy's situation and directing this special form of combat; the brave and stubborn Grachev risks his life to escape from prison to deliver a letter signed by all the crew members to the French consulate, but in the end, his signature is washed away by the rain, and he cannot return home with the other comrades; the lovable radio operator Lida does not bow her head under the enemy's guns and shouts "Long live the great Soviet motherland!" The Second Mate Sakharov, who had been severely criticized by the crew for his rude character, after being imprisoned alone for ten months, meets Grachev, who has escaped from prison to deliver the letter, and bites his arm, dipping it in blood to sign his name... Most unforgettable is the cheerful and lively young man Reisky, who, in order to take on the task of liaison and communication, would rather be misunderstood, rebuked, and abused by his comrades, and even risk being seen through and killed by the enemy, bravely and ingeniously fighting and finally winning the victory of most of the crew members gaining their freedom.
    From the film, we also see some patriotic and upright images of Taiwanese compatriots who live a life worse than that of beasts of burden, but their hearts are all facing Beijing. The old soldier who protected the Soviet sailors said righteously when he was killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang: "I am Chinese! Taiwan is only a very small part of the great motherland... In Taiwan, many people think the same as I do!" This is the voice of thousands of Taiwanese compatriots. They are willing to sacrifice their lives to rescue Soviet friends.
    Do not have any illusions about imperialists and their running dogs; the struggle against the "Cold War" makers must be resolute and thorough. This is the most important conclusion that the film "Extraordinary Incident" gives us. The "Tuapse" incident has passed five or six years, but this conclusion still has realistic educational significance. The U.S. imperialism's "Cold War" conspiracy has not stopped; the piratical acts like the "Extraordinary Incident" have not stopped. Therefore, our vigilance and struggle against U.S. imperialism cannot stop for a moment!

### 对“冷战”制造者的斗争必须坚决

    对“冷战”制造者的斗争必须坚决
    吴茜
    美帝国主义从来就是说尽好话、干尽坏事的。他们满口仁义道德，骨子里却是一肚子坏水；他们表面上挂着“和平”的招牌，实际上从来也没有停止过制造“冷战”。过去是这样，现在也是这样。
    1954年6月23日，苏联油船“图阿普斯”号，在台湾以南海面上，受到袭击，被劫到台湾的高雄港。全体船员被囚禁在蒋介石匪帮的监狱里达十三个月之久。在这十三个月里，敌人使尽了他们的一切无耻伎俩，想使苏维埃水手们背叛祖国，但是，他们什么也没有得到。而这件事本身，却再一次地暴露了美帝国主义的海盗面目。就像“真理报”在当时发表的一篇文章里指出的：“这种非法的行动，并不是偶然的，而是美国当局蓄意奉行的政策的一部分。”
    苏联影片“非常事件”，把这一震惊世界的事件，如实地记录了下来，让全世界的人们，再一次地看清这些“冷战”制造者们的无耻嘴脸和强盗行径。美国官方曾经抵赖过关于劫持“图阿普斯”号的罪行，但是，铁证如山，他们怎能抵赖得了？这事发生在美国海军所控制的海面上，美国报纸专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊也承认，在“图阿普斯”号油船被扣留以前，曾经有一架美国海军水上飞机在它的上空盘旋了好久，向执行拦劫任务的蒋介石海盗舰只指示这艘苏联油船的方位。劫夺苏联油船，只是美帝国主义的“冷战”活动中的一步棋而已。在影片里，那个美帝国主义的走狗不是说得清清楚楚吗？“这就是冷战，别人发明了这种战争，他们相信它的力量和必要性。我们执行他们的意志。”
    一场剧烈的尖锐的斗争在我们面前展开了。美帝国主义和它的走狗们，无所不用其极地耍着各种各样的手段：用死亡和饥饿来威胁，用金钱和美女来引诱，对被隔离的每一个人说：“大家都在拒绝回俄国的申请书上签字了，现在只剩下你一个人啦！”“你们的政委，坐自己的小汽车兜风啦。”……甚至还从美国派来一个出卖了自己的灵魂的叛徒，整天轮番地向每个船员进行无耻的“游说”。目的就是一个：想使这群苏联水手们背叛自己的祖国。美帝国主义者妄想从这一笔赌注上增加一些“冷战”的资本。
    然而，他们把“宝”押错了。在他们面前的，并不是软骨头，并不是那种轻易被收买的败类，而是坚贞不屈的苏维埃人，是苏联共产党培养教育出来的平凡而又伟大的人。他们有的是共产党员，有的是非党群众，每个人有自己的性格的特点，也有这样或那样的缺点，但是，有一点是共同的，那就是对社会主义祖国的忠诚。当他们面临着一场严重的考验的时候，他们都是好样的。他们经受了各种残酷的折磨，总是昂首向敌人回答说：“不！”冷战制造者的一切阴谋诡计，在这群硬汉子面前，一个钱也不值。
    在被非法囚禁的十三个月里，他们一刻也不停止地向敌人进行坚决的斗争。影片塑造了一系列使人难忘的形象：第一副船长高瓦连柯沉着而果断，他时刻分析敌情，指挥这一场特殊形式的战斗；勇敢而倔强的格拉切夫，冒着生命的危险越狱向法国领事馆递送全体船员的签名信，最后，却由于雨水冲掉了自己的签名，而不能同别的同志一起回国；惹人喜爱的报务员丽达，在敌人的枪口下也没有低头，高喊“伟大的苏维埃祖国万岁！”曾因性格粗暴受到船员们严厉批评的副船长萨哈洛夫，在被单独囚禁十个月之后，遇见越狱送信的格拉切夫，竟咬破自己的胳膊，蘸着血签上自己的名字……最使人不能忘记的，是那个愉快活泼的小伙子莱依斯基，他为了担当联络通讯的任务，宁可遭到同志们的误解、斥责、辱骂，甚至冒着被敌人识破而被杀害的危险，勇敢而机智地进行斗争，最后争得大部分船员获得自由的胜利。
    从影片里，我们也看到一些爱国的、正直的台湾同胞的形象，他们过着牛马不如的生活，然而他们的心全向着北京。那个保护着苏联水手的老兵，在被蒋介石匪帮杀害的时候，义正词严地说：“我是中国人！台湾只是伟大祖国的很小一部分。……在台湾，很多人的想法跟我一样！”这正是千万个台湾同胞的心声。他们为了救护苏联朋友，不惜献出自己的生命。
    对帝国主义者及其走狗们，不要存在任何幻想；对“冷战”制造者的斗争，必须坚决彻底。这就是影片“非常事件”给我们的最重要的结论。“图阿普斯”号事件已经过去了五、六年，但是这个结论仍然有现实的教育意义。美国帝国主义的“冷战”阴谋，并没有停止；像“非常事件”这样的海盗行为，也没有停止。因此，我们对美帝国主义的警惕和斗争，也一刻不能停止！
