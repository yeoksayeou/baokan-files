"Reaching out to pluck the immortal fruit," people like to use this phrase to mock those who overestimate themselves, attempting to do things that are fundamentally impossible. There is nothing wrong with the phrase itself. Since ancient times, who has ever seen anyone reach out and pluck an immortal fruit? However, this phrase is often used by conservative forces as a form of public opinion to hinder the growth of new things.

Recently, a moving story emerged from Bengbu, Anhui, about five stevedores forging iron rails with their bare hands. This is a vivid example of being determined to pluck the immortal fruit. These five stevedores were all formerly baggage carriers and rickshaw pullers. In terms of education, the most educated had only just shaken off the label of illiteracy; in terms of technology, they knew nothing, and they lacked both funds and equipment. However, when the Party issued a call to the stevedoring department to build simple railways through self-reliance, they stepped forward and accepted the task of trial-casting iron rails. At first, those with conservative ideas mocked them, saying, "Illiterates forging iron rails, that's really reaching out to pluck the immortal fruit!" The five stevedores replied loudly, "The immortal fruit, we must pluck it!"

Relying on this spirit of "must pluck it," they built a makeshift shed with waste materials for production in the open air because they lacked a factory building. Since they lacked iron-smelting equipment, they found a broken gasoline barrel to use as a smelting furnace. Lacking raw materials, they pulled carts in all directions to collect them. Since they did not understand sand-casting technology, they studied hard from others. As a result, in less than a month, they cast "丄" shaped iron rails and laid a 1,000-meter-long ring railway around the port, replacing 2,000 carts and 500 people's heavy labor. People sang, "Stevedores have great energy, not afraid of any difficulties, breaking superstitions to cast iron rails, determined to send the carts back home." They then began to trial-produce "工" shaped iron rails. Under the slogan of "hard work plus ingenuity, breaking through technical barriers," they boldly experimented and constantly innovated, and finally produced high-quality iron rails that could run large locomotives weighing 90 to 160 tons. In more than half a year, they produced more than 38,000 meters of iron rails, laying three simple railways with a total length of 19 kilometers. The stevedores proudly sang, "In the past, we carried big packages, now we ride along, with a whistle blowing, the goods are delivered."

The stevedores wanted to pluck the "immortal fruit," and they finally plucked it. This example vividly proves a truth spoken by Chairman Mao: "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, not avoiding problems but solving them with a positive attitude, any difficulty in the world can be solved." (See page 9 of the selected works "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"). The reason why these five stevedores in Bengbu City were able to overcome numerous difficulties and pluck the "immortal fruit" was not because they had three heads and six arms, or had the ability to fly to the sky, but because under the leadership of the Party, they had turned over and become masters of the country, controlled their own destiny, and realized that in order to achieve complete liberation, they must get rid of heavy physical labor and vigorously promote tool reform and technological innovation. They not only had the desire to pluck the "immortal fruit," but also demonstrated the soaring enthusiasm of "must pluck the immortal fruit"; not waiting and expecting the "immortal fruit" to fall into their mouths automatically, but actually taking action to pluck it. They neither dreamed of plucking the fruit with one reach, nor blindly relied on one pair of hands, but moved hands and brains, combining practical work, hard work, and ingenuity, studying hard and drilling hard, learning while doing, and trying every means to pluck the immortal fruit. They firmly believed that as long as there is correct leadership from the Party, coupled with their soaring enthusiasm, all temporary difficulties encountered on the road ahead are nothing but "paper tigers," and the "immortal fruit" can always be eaten. This is the root cause of their creation of miracles.

Today, we are doing a great cause that our predecessors have never done before. There are many "immortal fruits" that we want to pluck. In general, it is to rapidly build our country from a country with a "poor and blank" economic face into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. As long as we, under the leadership of the Party, carry forward the spirit of "must pluck the immortal fruit," with red hearts and great ambitions, we will surely be able to break through barriers, be invincible, and overcome everything, and pluck all the immortal fruits into our hands!

### 非摘神仙果不可

    非摘神仙果不可
    余锡朋
    “伸手想摘神仙果”，人们爱用这句话来嘲笑人不自量力，妄图办根本办不到的事。这句话本身并没错。古往今来，谁见过伸手摘到神仙果的呢？然而，这句话总往往被保守势力用来作为阻碍新生事物成长的一种舆论力量。
    最近，我们安徽蚌埠出了一件五位搬运工人赤手空拳铸造铁轨的故事，就是一个立志摘神仙果的动人事例。这五位搬运工人，以前都是扛包、拉架车出身，论文化程度，最高的才摘掉文盲帽；论技术是一窍不通，资金设备更是一无所有。然而，当党向搬运部门提出自力更生办简易铁路的号召时，他们便挺身而出，接受了试铸铁轨的任务。一开始，有保守思想的人就嘲笑说，“大老粗铸铁轨，真是伸手想摘神仙果呢！”五位搬运工人却响亮地回答说：“神仙果，非摘不可！”
    他们就凭着这种“非摘不可”的精神，没有厂房，便用废料搭成席棚，露天生产；没有化铁设备，就找了一只破汽油桶代替化铁炉；缺乏原材料，便拉着板车分途四处收集；不懂翻砂造型技术，就向人刻苦学习。结果在不到一个月内就铸成“丄”型铁轨，铺起了一条一千多米长的环港铁路，代替了二千辆板车和五百人的笨重劳动。人们唱道：“搬运工人干劲大，天大困难都不怕，破除迷信铸铁轨，定叫板车回老家。”他们接着又动手试制“工”型铁轨。在“苦干加巧干，突破技术关”的口号下，大胆试验，不断革新，终于制成了能行驶九十至一百六十吨大机车的优质铁轨。半年多时间内，共生产了铁轨三万八千多米，铺了三条全长十九公里的简易铁路。搬运工人自豪地歌唱说：“从前扛大包，现在坐着跑，一声汽笛响，货物已运到。”
    搬运工人要摘“神仙果”，就终于摘到了。这个事例生动地证明了毛主席说过的一个真理：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”（见“中国农村社会主义高潮”选本第九页）蚌埠市这五位搬运工人之所以能够打破重重困难摘到“神仙果”，并不是因为他们长了三头六臂，或者有什么飞天的本领；而是因为他们在党的领导下，翻身做了国家的主人，掌握了自己的命运，觉悟到要彻底解放便必须摆脱笨重的体力劳动，大搞工具改革和技术革新。他们不但有摘“神仙果”的要求，而且确实拿出了“非摘到神仙果不可”的冲天干劲；不等待和企望“神仙果”自动掉进自己的嘴里，而是切切实实地动手去摘它。他们既不空想一伸手便摘到果子，也不是光凭着一双手蛮干，而是动手又动脑，把实干、苦干和巧干结合起来，苦学苦钻，边干边学，千方百计地把神仙果摘到手。他们坚决相信，只要有党的正确领导，加上自己的冲天干劲，一切前进道路上遇到的暂时困难都不过是“纸老虎”，“神仙果”总是能吃到的。这便是他们创造奇迹的根由。
    今天，我们正在干前人从没有干过的伟大事业。我们要摘的“神仙果”多得很，总的来说，是要把我国由一个经济面貌“一穷二白”的国家迅速建设成为一个现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。只要我们在党的领导下，发扬那种“非摘神仙果不可”的精神，心红志大，我们就一定能够闯关破阵，战无不胜、攻无不克，把一切神仙果都摘到手里！
