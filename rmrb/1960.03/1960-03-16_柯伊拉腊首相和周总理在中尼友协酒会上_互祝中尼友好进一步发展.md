Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Koirala, and his wife, along with all the distinguished Nepalese guests accompanying them, were warmly welcomed by the President of the China-Nepal Friendship Association, Zhou Jianren, at a grand reception this afternoon.

In his speech at the reception, Prime Minister Koirala said, "I believe that today and tomorrow, we must maintain and develop the traditional friendship between Nepal and China. Through the development of traditional friendship, and through mutual assistance and cooperation among Asian countries, peace in Asia can be guaranteed." The Prime Minister's remarks were warmly welcomed.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Shen Junru and Guo Moruo, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Pan Zili, and others attended the reception. They gathered with Prime Minister Koirala and all the distinguished Nepalese guests to celebrate the continuous development of friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people, wishing it everlasting.

The distinguished Nepalese guests accompanying the visit included: Minister of Engineering and Transport, Singh; Minister of Home Affairs and Justice, Upadhyaya; Foreign Affairs Secretary, Thapa; Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Shukla; Major General Rana; Member of the Upper House, Chhoti; and the Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Dixit, all attended the reception. Also invited to the reception were the Nepalese journalists' delegation led by the editor-in-chief of "New Society Newspaper", Pande, and Nepalese students studying in Beijing.

President Zhou Jianren first delivered a speech, extending a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to Prime Minister Koirala and his wife, as well as other accompanying distinguished guests, who brought the profound friendship of the Nepalese people. He said that Nepal is our close neighbor, and China and Nepal have a traditional friendly relationship of harmonious coexistence. This friendly relationship is something that the people of both countries have always been proud of. We are very pleased that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the traditional friendly relations have not only been restored, but also gained new development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Zhou Jianren said that the Chinese people greatly admire the great efforts made by the government and people of the Kingdom of Nepal in safeguarding national interests and developing the national economy, and are excited about the achievements they have made in this regard. The Kingdom of Nepal has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs. The Chinese people welcome and fully support this wise foreign policy of the Nepalese government.

Zhou Jianren said that, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, in recent years, our two countries have been continuously developing cultural and friendly exchanges, which has further strengthened the mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and enhanced our traditional friendship. The Chinese people are very pleased about this. Zhou Jianren finally said that now, the esteemed Prime Minister Koirala has personally come to visit our country, which marks that the friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people is entering a new stage, and the Chinese and Nepalese people will join hands more closely to make new contributions to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

When Prime Minister Koirala spoke, the applause was continuous. The Prime Minister said that in the few days we have been in China, wherever we go and whoever we meet, we have felt the Chinese people's friendship and kindness towards us, which makes me very happy.

The Prime Minister talked about his impressions of his visit to Beijing, praising the Chinese people's enthusiasm, drive, and perseverance in construction. He said that although our two countries have different social systems, the tasks borne by the governments of our two countries are common, that is, to get rid of the scourge left to us by feudal rule and colonialism. We both still need to improve the living standards of our people. I have always believed that mutual help and cooperation among Asian countries is the best way to promote friendship. When the Prime Minister talked about his impression of visiting the Sanatorium for Asian and African Students today, he said that there were students from various countries recuperating there, just like a big family, which made me particularly happy. There were also Nepalese students recuperating there, which symbolized the friendship between our two countries.

The Prime Minister said that the Nepalese government and the Nepalese people are very grateful to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for the assistance provided to Nepal's construction. This time, my wife and I, as well as other members of Nepal, visited China, and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you here. After returning, I will tell the Nepalese people how warmly you welcomed us, and how respectful and friendly you are to the Nepalese people.

The Prime Minister finally proposed a toast to the friendship between China and Nepal, to the continuous prosperity and progress of the Chinese people, to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to the unity of Asian countries, and to the good health of Premier Zhou Enlai. The Prime Minister's speech was met with extremely warm welcome.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech amidst warm applause. He took this opportunity to once again wish for the further development and consolidation of the friendly relations between China and Nepal, and to wish for the everlasting friendship between the people of China and Nepal. Premier Zhou invited everyone to raise their glasses to the health of Prime Minister Koirala and his wife, as well as all the distinguished Nepalese guests.

The reception proceeded in a very warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end. People from all ethnic groups and walks of life in China and directors of the China-Nepal Friendship Association in Beijing attended the reception.
