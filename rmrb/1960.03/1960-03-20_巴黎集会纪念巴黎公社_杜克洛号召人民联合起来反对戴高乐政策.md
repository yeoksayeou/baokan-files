Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 19th: The French Communist Party held a rally at the Mutualité in Paris on the evening of the 18th to commemorate the 89th anniversary of the founding of the Paris Commune.

Several thousand residents of Paris and the Parisian suburbs attended the rally, including a delegation from the French Communist Party led by General Secretary Maurice Thorez and representatives from other democratic organizations.

Étienne Fajon, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party who presided over the meeting, said that although the Paris Commune existed for only 71 days, the Paris Commune and its cause are immortal. Fajon said that it has been less than a hundred years since the establishment of the Paris Commune, but today very few working people or intellectuals doubt the justice of the Paris Commune and that its cause will triumph in the near future.

French Communist Party Secretary Duclos delivered a long speech, in which he listed the main measures taken by the Paris Commune and the heroic struggle to defend the Paris Commune. He said, "The Paris Commune, which was essentially a government of the working class, stipulated two extremely important goals. That is, the Commune wanted to liberate France from German invasion and liberate the workers from capitalism by establishing socialism. Therefore, in the Commune, national interests are closely linked with the class interests of the proletariat."

Amid enthusiastic applause from the entire hall, Duclos said that although the Paris Commune did not exist for long, the victory of the subsequent October Revolution avenged the Paris Commune, and the victory of the socialist revolution marked the beginning of a new historical era.

Speaking of the prosperity of the Soviet Union, Duclos said: The French people believe that the visit of Soviet Chairman Khrushchev to France will contribute to the cause of peace and Franco-Soviet friendship.

Turning to the current situation in France, Duclos pointed out that De Gaulle flatly refused to convene a meeting of the National Assembly to discuss agricultural issues, despite the demands of the majority of deputies. Duclos said that this shows that the National Assembly is an assembly without real power, and to him, the will of the people does not count for anything.

Duclos said that now is the time for all those who are harmed by the policies of the monopoly bourgeoisie pursued by the De Gaulle regime to unite and act. Faced with a regime whose despotic face is becoming increasingly exposed, we must point out to the working class and all the French people the prospects for changing the situation.

    巴黎集会纪念巴黎公社
    杜克洛号召人民联合起来反对戴高乐政策
    新华社巴黎19日电　法国共产党18日晚上在巴黎的团结大厅举行了纪念巴黎公社成立八十九周年的大会。
    有好几千巴黎和巴黎郊区的居民参加了大会，参加大会的还有以总书记莫里斯·多列士为首的法国共产党代表团和其他民主组织的代表。
    主持大会的法国共产党政治局委员艾蒂安·法戎说，虽然巴黎公社只存在七十一天，但是巴黎公社和它的事业是不朽的。法戎说，现在离开巴黎公社成立不到一百年，但是今天已经很少有劳动人民或者有知识的人再怀疑巴黎公社的正义性和它的事业将在不远的将来取得胜利。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛作了长篇发言，他列举了巴黎公社所采取的各个主要措施和为保卫巴黎公社而进行的英勇斗争，他说，“实质上是工人阶级政府的巴黎公社规定了两个极其重要的目标。这就是，公社要把法国从德国的侵入中解放出来，并且用建立社会主义把工人们从资本主义中解放出来。因此，在公社中，民族利益是和无产阶级的阶级利益紧紧联合在一起的”。
    杜克洛在整个大厅热烈的掌声中说，巴黎公社虽然存在时间不长，但是后来的十月革命的胜利为巴黎公社复了仇，社会主义革命的胜利标志出新的历史纪元的开始。
    杜克洛谈到苏联的繁荣昌盛时说：法国人民相信：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的访问法国将对和平和法苏友谊的事业作出贡献。
    杜克洛在谈到法国目前局势时指出，戴高乐不顾大多数议员的要求断然拒绝召开国民议会会议讨论农业问题。杜克洛说，这表明国民议会是没有实权的议会，而且对他来说，人民的意志是不算一回事的。
    杜克洛说，现在是一切受戴高乐政权奉行的垄断资产阶级的政策之害的人们联合起来行动的时候了。面对着这样一个专制面目日益暴露的政权，我们要向工人阶级和法国全体人民指出改变局势的前景。
