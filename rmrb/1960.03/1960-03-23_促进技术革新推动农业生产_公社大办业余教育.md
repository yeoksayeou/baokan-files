Promote Technological Innovation to Drive Agricultural Production
Communes Vigorously Develop Amateur Education

Hebei Changli
Used mass movement methods to train a large number of technical personnel

(Reported by this newspaper) Changli County, Hebei Province, has adopted the method of vigorously launching mass movements to widely carry out technical education and train technical personnel.

Changli County has adopted a variety of forms to carry out technical education. One is to run Red and Expert Schools and amateur technical schools. At present, the county has a total of 66 Red and Expert Schools and 263 amateur technical schools. The second is to hold short-term training courses and organize technical instruction activities according to seasonal needs. The third is that old hands teach new hands, and old factories help new factories. The county has widely launched activities of masters taking apprentices. The fourth is to "invite in" and "send out." In the past year, the county has sent more than 5,000 people to other provinces and counties to "learn from experience," learning many new technologies such as mechanical repair, tractor driving, land leveling, soil fertilizer manufacturing, and soil and water conservation from other places. Communes have also carried out mutual learning and cooperation in technology to jointly improve the level of technical personnel. The Guoxiang and Mujing communes, which are closer to the city, have hired teachers and technicians from the Changli Agricultural College and Fruit Tree Research Institute to give lectures in their own communities and teams, with good results.

Through the above measures, Changli County trained a total of 3,491 farmer researchers and 68,500 various technicians last year. Due to the unprecedented growth of technical strength and the continuous improvement of technical level, the county has basically achieved that small repairs do not leave the team, medium repairs do not leave the commune, and large repairs do not leave the county in terms of agricultural tool repair. In terms of animal husbandry, the county has basically controlled more than a dozen infectious diseases of livestock and poultry that were popular in the past, such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine plague, equine encephalomyelitis, anthrax, sheep internal parasites, and fowl cholera. Some technical personnel have made greater inventions and creations after learning. Since last year, the county has had more than 50,000 new technology inventions.

Henan Ye County
Liancun Commune Persists in Amateur Education, Improves Culture, and Promotes Production

(Reported by this newspaper) The amateur education of the Liancun People's Commune in Ye County, Henan Province, is evergreen and thriving. 80% of the commune's young and middle-aged people and grassroots cadres can read general books and periodicals, and can write short articles of 500 to 3,000 words. Through extensive reading, writing, and practice, they have established 211 amateur higher primary classes and 38 amateur junior high classes.

The Liancun People's Commune is full of a spirit of striving to learn. According to rough statistics, the commune read more than 180,000 extracurricular books last year, and the number of newspapers and periodicals subscribed increased by two-thirds compared with the previous year. Wang Lingyun, a member of the Qingzhuang Production Brigade who is studying in an amateur middle school and is the mother of four children, was illiterate before liberation. In the past year, she has read 125 books, can write articles of 3,000 words, and has also learned junior high school geometry and some algebra. Last year, during the socialist education movement, the commune wrote 140,000 articles recalling and comparing the past and present, carrying out self-education with great effect, and the commune has selected and printed a part of it as political teaching material.

The spirit and perseverance of the masses and cadres of this commune in persisting in learning are very touching. They have persisted in learning since the literacy campaign began in 1950. Especially after communization, the concentration of production and the collectivization of life have provided more favorable conditions for centralized learning.

The Liancun People's Commune Party Committee has found a set of organizational forms that combine production and learning through long-term exploration, with the production team as the study class, the production group as the study group, and teachers and students working together. The learning organization has never been disrupted in the allocation of labor, so their learning has never been interrupted.

Due to long-term persistence in amateur cultural learning, the political and cultural level of the commune members has been improved, production has been promoted, and technological innovation has been promoted. The amateur middle school class of the Qingzhuang Production Brigade is a red flag class for learning in the entire commune, and it is also a shock brigade for production and a standard-bearer for technological innovation in the commune. They have conducted many comparative experiments on excellent varieties in their own experimental fields, making the yields of cotton, corn, tobacco and other crops several times to dozens of times higher than the general yield of the commune, and used the physical knowledge they learned to improve tools. Liu Fenglan of the junior high school class used the principles of mechanics to create a waterwheel group that increased work efficiency by more than two times.

Inner Mongolia Hulunbuir
Xisumu Commune Herdsmen Persist in Amateur Learning in Combination with Production

(Reported by this newspaper) For two years, the herdsmen of the Xinihe Xisumu People's Commune in Hulunbuir Grassland, Inner Mongolia, have persisted in amateur cultural learning in combination with animal husbandry production. Most of the commune's more than 340 young and middle-aged herdsmen were illiterate in the past, and now 97% have gotten rid of illiteracy; 52% of those who have shaken off the label of illiteracy have entered amateur higher primary school study. More than 60 people who have graduated from higher primary school and grassroots cadres have entered amateur junior high school study.

In the past, herdsmen could not read and could not write letters or read newspapers. They did not even know the numbers on banknotes, and they felt inconvenienced everywhere in their lives; moreover, they all realized that illiteracy could not keep up with the leapfrog development of the national situation. Therefore, during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the herdsmen, under the leadership of the Party, launched a movement to advance towards culture. For two years, young and middle-aged people have persisted in learning in combination with herding: studying in Mongolian yurts in the morning and evening, and studying while herding on the pasture during the day, forming a learning upsurge of "wherever there are cattle and sheep, there is learning, and the grassland is full of schools and the sound of reading." An important factor in the formation of this learning upsurge is that the Party has strengthened its leadership over the cultural revolution of the herdsmen. The commune Party organization organized all members to study in amateur cultural schools, and the secretary of the commune Party committee served as the principal; each production team set up a branch school, and the secretary of the team branch served as the principal of the branch school. Each branch school organizes study classes, higher primary classes, and literacy consolidation classes. Each Aoteer (nomadic group) of each production team organizes a study group. The commune Party committee also trained more than 30 civilian teachers. Under the attention of the Party committee, the herdsmen participating in amateur learning are very enthusiastic, study hard and practice hard, and make rapid progress. Some people can now read letters and newspapers. (Guo Pingyong) (Attached picture)

    促进技术革新推动农业生产
    公社大办业余教育
    河北昌黎
    用大搞群众运动方法培养了大批技术人材
    本报讯　河北省昌黎县采取大搞群众运动的方法，广泛开展技术教育，培养技术人材。
    昌黎县开展技术教育采取了多种多样的形式。一种是举办红专学校和业余技术学校。现在全县共有红专学校六十六所、技术业余学校
  二百六十三所。第二种是按照季节的需要，举办短期训练班与组织技术传授活动。第三种是老手教新手，老厂帮新厂。全县广泛开展了师傅带徒弟的活动。第四种是“请进来”、“派出去”。一年来，全县共派出五千多人次到外省外县去“取经”，从外地学习了机械修配、拖拉机驾驶、平整土地、土化肥制造、水土保持等很多新技术。各公社之间也开展了技术上的互相学习、互相协作，共同提高技术人员的水平。离城较近的果乡、木井等公社聘请了昌黎农学院、果树研究所的教师和技术人员到本社、本队讲课，效果很好。
    通过上述措施，去年昌黎县共培养出农民研究员三千四百九十一人，各种技术手六万八千五百人。由于技术力量的空前壮大和技术水平的不断提高，全县在农具修配方面已经基本上做到了小修不出队、中修不出社、大修不出县。在畜牧方面，全县已经基本上控制了过去流行的猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫、马脑炎、炭疽、羊内寄生虫、鸡霍乱等十几种畜禽传染病。有些技术人员经过学习，有了较大的发明创造。去年以来，全县共有五万多项新技术创造发明。
    河南叶县
    廉村公社坚持业余教育提高了文化推动了生产
    本报讯　河南省叶县廉村人民公社的业余教育，四季常青，蓬勃发展。全社80％的青壮年和基层干部能阅读一般书籍和报刊，能写五百字到三千字的短文。他们通过大读、大写、大练，已经办起二百一十一班业余高小，三十八班业余初中。
    廉村人民公社，充满着奋发的学习空气。据粗略统计，去年一年全社读了十八万多册课外读物，报刊比前年增订三分之二。现在在业余中学学习的庆庄生产大队队员、四个孩子的母亲王凌云，解放前是个文盲，一年来，读了一百二十五本书，能写三千字的文章，又学会了初中的几何和部分代数。去年，社会主义教育运动中，全社写了十四万篇回忆对比的文章，进行自我教育，效果很大，公社已经选印了一部分，作为政治教材。
    这个公社的群众和干部坚持不懈的学习精神和毅力是很感动人的。从1950年开始扫盲，他们就一直坚持学习，特别是公社化以后，生产集中和生活集体化，给集中学习提供了更有利的条件。
    廉村人民公社党委经过长期摸索，找出了一套生产和学习相结合的组织形式，以生产队为学习班，生产组为学习组，教师和学生同劳动。在劳动力调配当中从来没有打乱过学习组织，因而他们的学习从来没有间断过。
    由于长期坚持了业余文化学习，提高了社员的政治和文化水平，推动了生产，促进了技术革新。庆庄生产大队的业余中学班，是全公社的学习红旗班，同时也是公社生产的突击班和技术革新的旗手。他们在自己种的试验田中，进行了许多优良品种对比试验，使棉花、玉米、烟叶等作物产量比公社一般产量高几倍到几十倍，并把学到的物理知识，用来改良工具，初中班刘风兰利用力学原理，创造了提高工效二倍多的水车群。
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔
    西苏木公社牧民结合生产坚持业余学习
    本报讯　内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原锡尼河西苏木人民公社牧民们两年来结合牧业生产，坚持业余文化学习。全公社青壮年牧民三百四十多人，过去大部分是文盲，现在97％已摆脱了文盲状态；摘掉文盲帽子的人，有52％已进入业余高小学习。高小毕业的和基层干部六十多人已进入业余初中学习。
    牧民们过去不识字不能写信、看报，甚至钞票上的数字也不知道，生活上感到处处不方便；而且也都认识到不识字跟不上国家形势的飞跃发展，于是在1958年大跃进中，牧民们在党的领导下掀起了向文化进军的运动。两年来青壮年们结合放牧坚持了学习：早晚在蒙古包里学习，白天在牧场上一边放牧一边学习，形成了“哪里有牛羊群那里就有学习，草原上到处是学堂，处处有读书声”的学习高潮。这个学习高潮形成的重要因素，是党加强了对牧民文化革命的领导。公社党组织把全体社员都组织到业余文化学校学习，公社党委书记任校长；各生产队设分校，由队支部书记任分校校长。各分校组织学习班、高小班、扫盲巩固班。各生产队的敖特尔（游牧小组）都组织学习小组。公社党委还培训了三十多名民师。在党委的重视下，参加业余学习的牧民们热情很高，勤学苦练，进步很快，有的人现在已能看信、看报纸了。　（郭平永）（附图片）
