Editorial Notes:

    "Many Hands Make Light Work"
    This year, Shanxi Province has started constructing over 400 blast furnaces of various types, with a pig iron production capacity that will reach one million tons. Hunan Province plans to establish 2,300 iron-smelting furnaces, and once they are put into production, pig iron output will increase more than ninefold compared to last year. After tens of thousands of small and medium-sized blast furnaces are completed across the country, their production capacity will exceed 20 million tons. These encouraging facts prove the complete correctness of the policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, as well as large and small to medium-sized enterprises. This is precisely a case of "many hands make light work!" Look! The magnificent picture of ten thousand blast furnaces rising from the ground, with molten iron flowers blooming everywhere and iron flowing rapidly, will unfold before us in the short term. Our iron and steel industry will develop rapidly, and the time it takes to catch up with Britain will be even shorter!

    “众人拾柴火焰高”
    山西省今年动手兴建四百多座各种类型的高炉，它们的产铁能力将达到一百万吨；湖南省计划建立两千三百多座炼铁炉投入生产后，生铁产量将比去年增加九倍多；全国成万座中小型高炉建成后，生产能力就能超过二千万吨。这样鼓舞人心的事实，证明中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举方针的完全正确。这正是“众人拾柴火焰高”。看吧！万座高炉平地起，到处铁花怒放、铁水奔流的壮丽图画，就将在短期内展开在我们面前，我国的钢铁工业就将飞速发展，赶上英国的时间就将更短了！
