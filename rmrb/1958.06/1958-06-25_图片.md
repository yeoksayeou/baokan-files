    Zhejiang Province's Wuxing County established a higher education institution specializing in training agricultural middle school teachers, Huzhou Normal College, in just one month. This school was established based on the principle of diligence and thrift, making full use of the existing equipment and manpower of the original Huzhou Normal School. Most of the school's students are rural primary school teachers and young people from society. The courses they study are also established according to the needs of agricultural middle schools.

    浙江省吴兴县只用了一个月的时间，办起了一所专门培养农业中学师资的高等学校——湖州师范专科学校。这所学校是根据勤俭办学的原则，充分利用了湖州师范学校原有的设备和人力办起来的。这个学校的学员大部分是农村小学教员和社会青年，他们学习的课程也是根据农业中学的需要而设立的。图为他们正在上珠算课。右下角是在向农民学习农业技术。　王友生摄（新华社稿）
