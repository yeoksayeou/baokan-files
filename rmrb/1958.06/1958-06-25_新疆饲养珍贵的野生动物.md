Xinjiang raises precious wild animals

    In the dense forests and rivers and lakes of the Tianshan and Altai Mountains, there grows a wide variety of precious wild animals. Several of these wild animals, which have high economic value, have begun to be artificially raised.

    Sable
    In the Altai Mountains, the Autonomous Region’s Foreign Trade Bureau has begun to build a sable farm. The sable is a rare wild animal in the world, and its fur is light, soft, thick, and fine, with long, needle-like hairs, making it extremely valuable. In our country, it is only produced in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang. This animal likes cold climates and mostly lives in burrows in the crevices of high mountain cliffs; it is timid and cunning, and moves its home as soon as it finds something unusual near its burrow, sometimes moving several times a day, so it is not easy to catch. The Autonomous Region Foreign Trade Bureau will mobilize experienced Kazakh hunters to use methods such as snow tracking to capture them. The sable farm plans to raise 100 to 200 sables this year, depending on the capture situation.

    Muskrat
    Muskrats grow everywhere along the Ertix River and Ili River in Xinjiang. In order to meet domestic and export needs, the autonomous region's foreign trade departments are selecting some reed lakes in the Yili and Korla areas, capturing muskrats for free-range breeding, and massively propagating them. Muskrat fur is very valuable, easy to catch, and very easy to raise, without requiring a lot of manpower and technical equipment. They can be released in one or several lakes to reproduce. This animal has a strong reproductive capacity, giving birth to two to five litters per year, with an average of seven or eight pups per litter, and up to sixteen. With fixed breeding lakes, it is easier to catch them during the annual skinning season.

    Deer
    Recently, another deer farm was established on the grasslands of Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture and Hexing County. This is the second deer farm established in Xinjiang by the Autonomous Region's Health Department to develop the production of valuable medicinal materials such as deer antlers. This year, the two deer farms will raise up to 400 deer and will begin to breed them in large numbers. Xinjiang is one of the main deer producing areas in my country. There are herds of wild deer in the Tianshan forest area and along the Tarim River, estimated to number in the tens of thousands. Every year, farmers and herdsmen in the vicinity can pick up more than 100 tons of naturally shed antlers in places where deer herds roam. However, naturally shed deer antlers are not as valuable as the velvet antlers sawn off at deer farms.

### 新疆饲养珍贵的野生动物

    新疆饲养珍贵的野生动物
    在天山和阿尔泰山的丛山密林和河流湖泊中，生长着种类繁多的珍贵的野生动物。其中有几种具有很高经济价值的野生动物，已开始加以人工饲养。
    紫貂
    在阿尔泰山区，自治区对外贸易局开始兴建一座紫貂饲养场。紫貂是世界上一种稀有的野生动物，它的皮毛质轻柔、绒厚而细、毛长如针，极为名贵。我国仅有新疆和黑龙江两地出产。这种动物性喜寒冷，大多穴居在高山悬崖峭壁的夹缝里；胆小而狡黠，穴旁发现稍有异状就搬家，有时一天搬几次，所以不易捕捉。自治区对外贸易局将动员有经验的哈萨克猎人用雪地追踪等办法捕捉。紫貂场今年准备根据捕捉情况，饲养一百只到二百只。
    麝鼠
    新疆额尔齐斯河和伊犁河两岸到处都有麝鼠生长。为了满足国内和出口的需要，自治区对外贸易部门正在伊犁和库尔勒地区选择一些苇湖，捕捉麝鼠实行散放饲养，大量繁殖。麝鼠的皮毛很贵重，捕捉较易，饲养十分简便，不需很多人工和技术设备，可以散放在一个或几个湖泊里，任其繁殖。这种动物繁殖力很强，每年生两胎到五胎，平均每胎生七、八个小鼠，最多达十六个。有了固定繁殖的湖泊，每年取皮时节，捕捉就更容易。
    鹿
    在巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州和靖县的草原上，最近又建立了一座养鹿场。这是自治区卫生部门为了发展鹿茸等名贵药材生产在新疆建立的第二座养鹿场。今年，两个养鹿场豢养的鹿，将达到四百只，并开始大量繁殖。新疆是我国主要产鹿地区之一，天山丛林区和塔里木河两岸野鹿成群，估计有数万只，每年附近农牧民在鹿群出没的地方都可拾到一百多吨自然脱落的鹿角。但是自然脱落鹿的角，远不如养鹿场锯下的鹿茸名贵。
