Some people, once summer arrives, feel drowsy all day long, lose their appetite, and even lose weight, as if they are sick but not really. This condition is called "bitter summer" in the north and "summer bore" in the south.

Loss of appetite is probably the most prominent problem of "bitter summer." Medical examinations have also proven that in the hot season, many people's gastric juice secretion decreases, and the stomach's motor ability also experiences varying degrees of impairment. Therefore, there is a reason for people's loss of appetite in summer. But why does gastric juice secretion decrease in summer? Opinions vary. Some say it is because people's skin blood vessels expand more severely in summer, while the internal organs become relatively anemic. This makes gastrointestinal motility weak, which affects appetite. Others believe it is due to excessive sweating. Because of sweating, sodium chloride, a component of table salt, is excreted from the body. Chlorine is one of the main components of gastric acid, so gastric acid secretion is reduced, which affects appetite. Some believe that people often like to eat cold food in summer, and cold food can prolong the time food stays in the stomach, which also affects appetite.

In summer, people often feel tired and mentally unwell, possibly because they cannot get enough rest in the hot weather, or it may be related to people's nervous system type.

"Bitter summer" can also be prevented. In terms of diet, in addition to eating less greasy food and more vegetables, it is best to eat less for lunch. When thirsty, you should drink water in small amounts and frequently. That is, you can drink water more often, but drink less each time. For those who have the habit of drinking salt tea or salt water, that is the best. If you don't have this habit, you can make the dishes saltier, so you can compensate for the salt lost with sweat. Secondly, you should regularly participate in physical exercise or manual labor, because exercise can promote the human body to better adapt to various climates. The best exercises in summer are swimming and cold water baths. In addition, trying to make life regular, taking a nap if possible, keeping the living room ventilated, and wearing seasonable clothes can all help eliminate "bitter summer."

"Bitter summer" is not a disease, but merely a special reaction of some people to summer. As long as you pay attention to your life, especially giving conscious exercise to your spirit and nerves, "bitter summer" will disappear without a trace.

    苦夏不是病
    江泉官
    有些人一到夏天，终日感到昏昏沉沉，食欲不振，体重也下降，好似有病实无病。这种情况，北方人叫“苦夏”，南方人叫“蛀夏”。
    食欲不振恐怕是苦夏最突出的一个问题了。医学的检查也证明了在炎热的季节里，很多人的胃液分泌减少了，胃的运动能力也随着发生程度不等的障碍。因此，夏天人们的食欲不振是有一定原因的。但是为什么在夏天胃液分泌就要减少？却是议论不一。有的人说是因为人的皮肤血管在夏天扩张得较厉害，而内脏就相对地贫血了，这就使胃肠道运动无力，以致影响了食欲。有人则认为这是由于出汗出得多了的缘故。因为出汗，体内的食盐——氯化钠随着排出了，而氯是胃酸的主要成份之一，胃酸分泌也就降低，因此影响了食欲。有的人认为夏天人多喜欢吃些冷食，而冷食能使食物在胃里停留的时间延长，因此也会影响食欲。
    夏天，人常感到身体疲倦，精神不爽，可能和在炎热的天气下不能得到充分的休息有关，也可能和人的神经类型有关。
    苦夏也可以预防。在饮食方面，除了少吃油腻的食物，多吃蔬菜以外，中午一顿最好吃得少些。口渴了，应该少量多次地饮水，也就是说喝水的次数可以多些，但每次喝得少些。有喝盐茶、盐水习惯的，那是最好也没有了。没有这个习惯的，可以把菜肴做得咸些，这样就可以补偿随着汗水流走的盐份了。其次，要经常参加体育锻炼或体力劳动，因为运动能促进人体更好地适应各种气候。夏天最好的锻炼莫过于游泳和冷水浴了。此外，尽量使生活有规律，能午睡的话，就午睡，住室应该通风，衣服应该合乎时令等，都可以帮助消除“苦夏”。
    苦夏不是病，只是某些少数人对夏天的特殊反应而已，只要在生活上加以注意，尤其是在精神、神经上予以有意识的锻炼，苦夏就会无影无踪了。
