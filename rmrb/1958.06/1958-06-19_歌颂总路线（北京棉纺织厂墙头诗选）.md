    In Praise of the General Line
    (Selected Wall Posters from Beijing Cotton Textile Factory)
    The General Line, like a raging fire,
    Revolutionary drive soars ten thousand feet higher,
    Beat down difficulties like subduing tigers,
    Kick key problems like capturing dragons.
    With the General Line in our hearts,
    Everyone can lift the sky with their hands,
    Catching up with England won't take fifteen years,
    Imperialism will all lag behind.
    With the General Line in our hearts,
    Difficulties tremble at the sight,
    The masses are strong and wise,
    If there are no conditions, create conditions.
    The General Line spreads everywhere,
    The banner unfurls, all turns red,
    If anyone doesn't believe, look up and see,
    Ramie yarn and poplin have already appeared.

    歌颂总路线
    （北京棉纺织厂墙头诗选）
    总路线，似火烧，
    革命干劲万丈高，
    拳打困难如伏虎，
    脚踢关键似擒蛟。
    心里装上总路线，
    人人双手能托天，
    赶英国不要十五年，
    帝国主义都得落后边。
    心里装上总路线，
    困难见了就打颤，
    众人力大智慧高，
    没有条件造条件。
    总路线，各处传，
    大旗一展全红遍，
    哪位不信抬头看，
    麻纱、府绸已出现。
