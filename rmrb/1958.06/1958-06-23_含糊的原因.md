    The Reason for Ambiguity
    The Nobusuke Kishi government of Japan is turning Japanese territory into a base for American nuclear weapons. The Soviet government has already issued two warnings to the Japanese government on this issue. However, the recent "unofficial view" expressed by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on this matter is still full of sophistry and lies.
    American B-47 bombers carrying atomic bombs have been patrolling over Japan, and American "Honest John" rockets have also been deployed on Japanese territory. This has been reported by many Japanese newspapers. The Japanese Foreign Ministry calls these reports "groundless" but also believes that "there is no need" to "deny them one by one." If we put this statement together with what Nobusuke Kishi said in the Diet on March 28 of last year—that "the United States has the right to bring nuclear weapons into Japan"—we can see that the problem is not that it is "not necessary" to "deny" it, but that it is difficult to "deny." Nobusuke Kishi wants to keep the Japanese people in the dark, which is why he always speaks ambiguously on the issue of not bringing nuclear weapons into Japan.

    含糊的原因
    日本岸信介政府正在把日本领土变为美国的核武器基地。苏联政府就这个问题已经两次向日本政府提出警告。但最近日本外务省对此表示的“非正式见解”，仍然是一片狡辩和谎言。
    美国的携带原子弹的B—47型轰炸机已在日本上空巡逻，美国的“诚实的约翰”火箭也在日本领土上被安置起来，这是日本许多报刊报道过的。日本外务省把这些消息叫作“没有根据”的，但又认为“没有必要一个一个地”“加以否认”。如果把这种说法同岸信介去年3月28日在国会说过的“美国有权把核武器运进日本”的那些话连在一起来看，就可以看出这个问题不是“没有必要”加以“否认”，而是难于“否认”。岸信介是想要把日本人民蒙在鼓里，这就是为什么关于不把核武器运进日本问题，他的话总是说得含糊不清的原因。
