The Japanese Communist Party's "Akahata" Issues Call
    Smash the Kishi Government's Attempts to Strengthen Reactionary Rule

    Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata," recently published an editorial calling on the entire party to exert all its efforts to organize a united action of peace, independence, and democratic forces to smash the attempts of the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to further submit to the United States externally and strengthen reactionary rule internally.

    The editorial pointed out that Japan's monopoly capital groups have a greater say in the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. This cabinet will be even more subservient to the United States and more openly implement policies that serve only the monopoly capital groups.

    The editorial said that the new cabinet's foreign policy will be to actively assist the United States' war policy against the Soviet Union and China, turn Japan into a missile base, and exacerbate international tensions. It will strengthen relations with the Syngman Rhee group and the Chiang Kai-shek group with the goal of "establishing an anti-communist Asia," continue to adopt a hostile policy towards China, and become a puppet of the United States in the United Nations.

    The editorial said that in terms of domestic policy, Nobusuke Kishi attempts to revise the current constitution, restore the Emperor's status, greatly deprive the Japanese people of the democratic rights they have gained after the war, and revise the election law to implement a small constituency system. At the same time, he is stepping up the fascist suppression of trade unions, attempting to weaken the working class and its vanguard, which play a leading role in the struggle to defend peace and democracy. The editorial pointed out that smashing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's current suppression of trade unions and its attempt to implement a small constituency system to revise the constitution is the urgent task at hand. At the same time, it is necessary to fight for the implementation of measures that allow monopoly capital to bear the expenses to maintain the lives of workers and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in order to cope with the economic recession.

    The editorial pointed out the deep-rooted contradictions harbored by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. These contradictions are: setbacks in Sino-Japanese relations; the "bottoming out" of the domestic economy and the economic crisis in the capitalist world. These contradictions force the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which is subservient to the United States and hostile to socialist countries, to confront the various demands of the Japanese people, forcing it to face serious difficulties.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: TASS, Tokyo, June 21st: Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said, regarding the Soviet Union's note to Japan regarding the news of nuclear weapons being transported into Japanese territory, that the Japanese government is very clear that nuclear weapons have already been transported into Japan.

    Yoshitaro Hirano pointed out that, according to "Akahata" reports, the Socialist Party had proposed an agreement with the United States to prohibit the testing of nuclear weapons and the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan, and Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi rejected this proposal. This fact alone proves that the Japanese government is aware of the presence of nuclear weapons in Japan.

    日共“赤旗报”发出号召
    粉碎岸政府加强反动统治企图
    据新华社22日讯  日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”最近发表社论，号召全党竭尽全力，组织团结和平、独立、民主力量的统一行动，粉碎岸信介第二届内阁对外进一步屈从美国，对内加强反动统治的企图。
    社论指出，日本垄断资本集团对第二次岸信介内阁拥有更大的发言权。这届内阁将会更加屈从美国，更加露骨地推行专为垄断资本集团服务的政策。
    社论说，新内阁的外交政策将是积极协助美国对苏联、中国所采取的战争政策，使日本变成导弹基地，以加剧国际紧张局势。它将以“建立反共亚洲”为目标，加强同李承晚集团、蒋介石集团的关系，对中国继续采取敌视政策，并且在联合国组织里成为美国代表的傀儡。
    社论说，在对内政策方面，岸信介企图修改现行宪法，恢复天皇的地位，大大地剥夺日本人民在战后所获得的民主权利，并且修改选举法实行小选举区制。同时，他加紧对工会进行法西斯镇压，企图使在保卫和平、民主的斗争中发挥领导作用的工人阶级和它的先锋队变成软弱无力。社论指出，粉碎岸信介内阁目前对工会的镇压和实施小选举区制以便修改宪法的企图，是当前的紧急任务。同时，必须进行斗争，争取实行让垄断资本负担经费，以维护工人和中小企业家的生活的办法，以应付经济萧条。
    社论指出了岸信介内阁所包藏的根深蒂固的矛盾。这些矛盾是：日中关系上的碰壁；国内经济的“锅底状态”和资本主义世界的经济危机。这些矛盾迫使屈从美国、敌视社会主义各国的岸信介内阁同日本人民的各项要求相对抗，使它不得不面临严重的困难。
    新华社22日讯  塔斯社东京21日讯：日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎在谈到由于核武器运进日本领土的消息而引起苏联向日本提出照会这件事时说，日本政府对于核武器已经运入日本这件事是知道得很清楚的。
    平野义太郎指出，据“赤旗报”报道，社会党曾经提出关于和美国签订一项禁止试验核武器和禁止向日本运进核武器的协议的建议，而日本首相岸信介拒绝了这个建议，这个事实本身就可证明日本政府是知道日本境内有核武器的。
