    The Uruguayan Communist Party organ "People's Newspaper" Points Out
    Yugoslav Leaders Appease Imperialism

    Xinhua News Agency: The Uruguayan Communist Party organ "People's Newspaper" published an article on April 25th, criticizing the modern revisionist theories of the leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and refuting the various slanders spread by bourgeois newspapers in order to distort the criticisms of the revisionism of the leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia by the communist parties of various countries.

    The article said that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, under the pretext of a "novel new road" to socialism, have seriously deviated from Marxism on many occasions and are actually standing at the forefront of a purely right-wing type of revisionist trend. This is obvious and well-known, and cannot be concealed in any way. Its most recent expression is Yugoslavia's refusal to sign the declarations of the communist and workers' parties of various countries.

    These differences existed before and were re-expressed at this congress (referring to the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia). This is the whole fact. It should also be clarified some issues that the capitalist press is attempting to distort:

    First, the issue was not raised by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, or the Polish United Workers' Party, etc., but by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In its draft program, it elaborated the class nature of the socialist camp countries, absurdly equating these countries with the imperialist camp.

    We have already had the opportunity to analyze this incredible position: it is far removed from Marxism, as different as heaven and earth; this leads to: pleasing the predatory imperialism, concealing imperialism's aggression and anti-socialist tendencies, and disarming the people of various countries in the face of this vicious enemy, while this enemy is flying over Europe with airplanes carrying atomic bombs.

    Second, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has broken the existing agreement: not to attack each other, to seek ways to exchange ideas and clarify ideological issues within a comradely scope, and not to interfere with each other.

    Third, Yugoslavia broke its promise, and the attitude taken by the Soviet Union and other countries' communist parties is by no means interference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs, as the Yugoslav leader Ranković would like to say. On the contrary, the problem is only that: in the theoretical publications of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it is pointed out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other communist parties believe that these views violate Marxism and the reality of the socialist camp; fraternal hopes are expressed to the Yugoslav communists, hoping that they will correct their erroneous theories in order to benefit the development of socialist thought.

    Fourth, it is not only the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that criticizes the erroneous views of the Yugoslavs, but also the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Polish United Workers' Party, and all communist parties that have received the draft program. This is to be expected. This is because Yugoslavia's theory is a frontal attack on the theory in the declaration unanimously adopted in Moscow in November (with the exception of Yugoslavia).

    Fifth, the attempt by our country's newspapers to show that the position of the Polish United Workers' Party is different from that of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saying that "Gomułka is closer to Belgrade," is insidious. The facts show that the Polish United Workers' Party criticized Yugoslavia's program, did not send a representative to the congress, and supported the positions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and other countries.

    Sixth, the fact that no official delegation was sent to the Seventh Congress, but the ambassadors of various countries in Belgrade were appointed as observers, cannot be considered interference or disrespect for internal affairs. It should be seen as a wise practice. Because in the theories to be discussed there are views that attack the systems of these countries (equating these countries with the American system), silence is impossible, and speaking out will further worsen relations, thereby further reducing the possibility of continuing the discussion within a more appropriate scope; there is no doubt that imperialism will applaud such open quarrels and ruptures, but fraternal communist parties do not want this. The same is true of the absence of observers from various countries during Ranković's harsh speech. No one can force representatives of great parties and great countries to attend or silently listen to and agree with the unfounded attacks on their countries, especially when the speakers are those who refuse to jointly agree to conduct fraternal discussions.

    As mentioned above, it can be clearly seen what is happening in Ljubljana. It is an ideological discussion, and there is no interference in internal affairs. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia unfortunately insists on its revisionist tendencies toward Marxism, while other communist parties conduct serious and fraternal principled criticisms. Since Marxists rely on principled policies and do not want to solve ideological problems with bombs (in contrast to what the United States is preparing), there is no doubt that Marxism—a scientific doctrine that has been tested by more than a century of historical events—will sooner or later triumph.

    The "People's Newspaper" published another article on April 30th.

    The article pointed out that the Moscow Declaration of last November and the proceedings of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia show that it is not, as the US imperialist propaganda organs say, that the communist and workers' parties of various countries interfered in Yugoslavia's internal affairs, but that the opposite is true.

    The article said that, in stark contrast to the reports of American news agencies, in the draft program submitted to the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, sent to the communist parties of various countries, and published, the Yugoslav communists did indeed violate the agreement signed with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—not to attack each other on issues of ideological disagreement, but to seek ways of comradely exchange of ideas. In what areas was the agreement violated? That is: the aforementioned draft openly put forward a series of views on the Soviet Union and other socialist countries that were very harmful to them. These views openly betrayed the theory adopted by the parties in November.

    In the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the socialist camp is equated with the imperialist camp. That is to say, the fraternal relations of mutual assistance in common endeavors while respecting each other's special problems (as is the case with the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies) are equated with the barbaric policies of imperialist oppression, plunder, and enslavement of weak countries (as is the case with the United States, Britain, or France and their colonies). In addition, the draft program also made a completely negative and defamatory assessment of the entire world communist movement and its current brilliant development. This view is interference in the communist parties of various countries and supplies weapons to the imperialist enemy.

    The article pointed out that silence cannot be maintained on such interference, and keeping silent is a principled concession. Since the Yugoslavs broke the agreement, the other parties cannot tie their hands and do at least clarify their position. This is what they did: expose the hypocrisy of the theory of equating the two camps, point out its theoretical weakness and how it violates reality, and sincerely hope that the Yugoslavs will carefully consider these facts that only benefit the common enemy. All the communist parties that signed the Moscow Declaration did so unanimously.

### 乌拉圭共产党机关报“人民报”指出  南共领导人取悦于帝国主义

    乌拉圭共产党机关报“人民报”指出
    南共领导人取悦于帝国主义
    新华社讯　乌拉圭共产党机关报“人民报”4月25日刊载文章，批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团的现代修正主义理论，并且驳斥资产阶级报刊为了歪曲各国共产党对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团修正主义的批判而散布的形形色色谰言。
    文章说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人以走向社会主义的“别出心裁的新道路”作借口，在许多场合下都严重地脱离了马克思主义，实际上是站在纯粹右派类型的修正主义潮流的最前列。这是明显的和众所周知的，是任何方式也掩盖不了的。它的最近的表示就是南斯拉夫拒绝在各国共产党和工人党的宣言上签字。
    这些分歧以前就存在，而在这次代表大会（指南共第七次代表大会）上又重新表现出来。这就是全部事实。还应该说明的是资本主义报刊企图歪曲的一些问题：
    一、问题不是苏联共产党、不是中国共产党、也不是波兰统一工人党等提出来的，而是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟提出来的。它在它的纲领草案中阐述了社会主义阵营各国的阶级性质，荒谬地把这些国家同帝国主义阵营等同起来了。
    我们已经有机会分析了这个令人难以置信的立场：它远远地离开了马克思主义，同马克思主义有天渊之别；这就导致了：取悦于掠夺成性的帝国主义，掩饰帝国主义的侵略和反社会主义的倾向，并且在这个凶恶的敌人面前解除各国人民的武装，而这个敌人正以载有原子弹的飞机在欧洲上空飞行。
    二、是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟破坏了已有的协议：不互相攻击，在同志式的范围内寻求交流思想的道路和阐明思想意识问题，而不互相干涉。
    三、南斯拉夫破坏了诺言，苏联和其他国家的共产党所采取的态度绝不是像南斯拉夫领导人兰科维奇所想说的那样是对南斯拉夫内政的干涉。相反地，问题仅仅是：在苏联共产党的理论性刊物上指明，苏联共产党和其他共产党认为这些观点违背了马克思主义和社会主义阵营的现实情况；向南斯拉夫共产党人提出兄弟般的希望，希望他们纠正错误的理论，以便有利于社会主义思想的发展。
    四、批评南斯拉夫人错误观点的不只是苏联共产党，而且还有中国共产党、捷克斯洛伐克共产党、波兰统一工人党和一切接到纲领草案的共产党。这是理所当然的。这是因为，南斯拉夫的理论是对十一月在莫斯科所一致通过（南斯拉夫例外）的宣言中的理论的正面进攻。
    五、我国的报刊力图表明波兰统一工人党的立场不同于苏联共产党的立场，说什么“哥穆尔卡更接近于贝尔格莱德”，这种企图是阴险的。事实表明，波兰统一工人党批评了南斯拉夫的纲领，没有派代表参加大会，并支持了苏联、中国等国的共产党的立场。
    六、没有派正式代表团参加第七次代表大会而指派各国驻贝尔格莱德的大使为观察员，根本不能认为是干涉或轻侮内政，应该把它看成是一种明智的做法。因为在所要讨论的理论中存在着攻击这些国家的制度的看法（把这些国家同美国的制度等量齐观），缄默是不可能的，而发言又会使关系更加恶化，从而更加缩小在更加适宜的范围内继续进行讨论的可能性；毫无疑问，帝国主义将在这样的公开争吵和破裂面前拍手叫好，但是兄弟共产党并不希望这样。兰科维奇进行尖酸刻薄的发言时各国观察员不到场的情况也同样是这样。任何人也不能强迫伟大的党和伟大国家的代表出席或默默地听取和同意对他们国家的毫无根据的攻击，特别是说话的人正是那些拒绝共同协议进行兄弟般讨论的人。
    如上所述，可以清楚地看到卢布尔雅那正在发生的是什么。是一个思想意识的讨论，并没有干涉内政。南共不幸地坚持对马克思主义的修正倾向，而其他共产党则进行严肃的和兄弟般的原则性批评。由于马克思主义者依靠原则性的政策并且不想用炸弹来解决思想意识问题（同美国所准备的相反），毫无疑问，马克思主义——经过一个多世纪整个历史事件考验的科学学说迟早要取得胜利。
    “人民报”在4月30日又发表了一篇文章。
    文章指出，去年11月的莫斯科宣言和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的经过表明，并不是像美国的帝国主义宣传机关所说的那样，是各国共产党和工人党干涉了南斯拉夫的内政，而事实恰恰相反。
    文章说，和美国通讯社的报道截然不同。在提交南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会、寄给各国共产党并公布了的纲领草案中，南斯拉夫共产党人的确违反了同苏联共产党所签订的协议——不在有思想分歧的问题上互相攻击，而寻求同志式的交流思想的道路。究竟在那些方面违反了协议呢？这就是：在上述草案中公开提出一系列关于苏联和其他社会主义国家的并且对它们非常有害的看法。这些看法公开背叛了各国党11月所通过的理论。
    在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案中，把社会主义阵营同帝国主义阵营等量齐观。也就是说，把在共同事业中互相援助而又尊重彼此的特殊问题（苏联、中国和人民民主国家就是这样）的兄弟关系和帝国主义压迫、掠夺和奴役弱国（这是美国、英国或法国同它们的殖民地的情况）的野蛮政策等同起来了。此外，纲领草案还对整个世界共产主义运动和它目前的光辉发展作了完全否定的和诬蔑性的估计。这种看法是干涉各国共产党，并且给帝国主义敌人供应了武器。
    文章指出，对这种干涉不能保持沉默，缄口不谈就是作原则性的让步。既然南斯拉夫人破坏了协议，其他的党就不能缚起手脚而不起码做到阐明自己的立场。这就是它们所做的：揭穿把两个阵营等同起来的理论的虚伪性，指出它在理论上的软弱性以及如何违反了实际，诚恳地希望南斯拉夫人仔细地想想这些仅仅对共同敌人有利的事实。在莫斯科宣言上签字的各国共产党都一致这样做了。
