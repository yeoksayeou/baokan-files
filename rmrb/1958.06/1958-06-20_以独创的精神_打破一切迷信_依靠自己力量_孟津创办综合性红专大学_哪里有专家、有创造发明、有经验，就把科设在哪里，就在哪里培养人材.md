With Original Spirit, Break All Superstitions, Rely on Our Own Strength:
Mengjin Establishes Comprehensive Red and Expert University
Where There Are Experts, Creations, Inventions, and Experience, Set Up the Department There, and Cultivate Talent There

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Chen Jian reports: Mengjin County, Henan Province, with a spirit of originality and innovation, broke all superstitions and conventions and relied on its own strength to establish a comprehensive Red and Expert University at the beginning of this month. This university has no fixed school buildings, nor all the equipment that a university should have. Its six colleges and forty-two departments are separately located in the relevant departments directly under the County People's Committee and throughout the county, creating a model of combining education and labor.

This university was born in the upsurge of the mass cultural and technical revolution in Mengjin County. In two months, the masses throughout the county established a number of agricultural universities and Red and Expert universities. These schools have become the center of all activities in the countryside. The task of the Mengjin County Comprehensive Red and Expert University is not only to help cadres in county-level organizations gradually achieve the goal of being both Red and expert through study to adapt to the current objective situation, but also to push the county's cultural and technical revolution to a new and higher stage.

The president and vice-president of this university are the county magistrate of Mengjin County and the director of the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee, respectively. The six colleges—the College of Agriculture, the College of Engineering, the College of Finance and Economics, the College of Political Education, the College of Medicine, and the Teachers College—are located in the relevant departments of the Party Committee and the government, such as the College of Agriculture being located in the County People's Committee's Bureau of Agriculture, and the College of Political Education being located in the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee. The students of each college are the cadres of the relevant departments. The source of teachers emphasizes adapting to local conditions and using local materials. The secretary of the County Party Committee, the county magistrate, the responsible cadres of various departments, and the main technical cadres are all teachers. However, the main emphasis is on individual hard study and diligent research. Students are required not to be obsessed with classrooms, but to combine their own business and their own experimental fields, go to the masses, participate in labor and work, and lead the masses in developing high-yield fields and technical innovations. This is the main criterion for evaluating students' performance.

The distribution of the forty-two departments belonging to these six colleges is unprecedented in the history of Chinese education. It adopts the principle of setting up the department wherever there are experts, creations, inventions, and experience, and cultivating talent there. For example, the Orthopedics Department of the College of Medicine is located in the Pingle Township Orthopedic Hospital, whose orthopedic doctor, Gao Yunfeng, is a nationally renowned orthopedic expert; the Cotton Department of the College of Agriculture is located in the Zhaiquan Agricultural Cooperative, which has the cotton-planting expert and provincial agricultural labor model Wang Mu. Wang Mu is now cultivating high-yield fields that produce 2,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu. All other departments are located throughout the county according to this principle. The students of each department are the directors and technicians of the Red and Expert universities and agricultural universities run by the masses throughout the county. The learning time is not fixed, ranging from two years to ten days or half a month, mainly depending on the specific situation and the current production needs. For example, since there is an urgent need to solve the fertilizer problem, the Chemistry Department, which started classes the earliest, has trained hundreds of bacterial fertilizer technicians in half a month, and now the entire county is engaged in bacterial fertilizer production. At present, three colleges and their departments of this university have already started classes.

This university, which was established in only half a month without spending a penny, first solved the problem of improving the teaching staff of the schools already run by the masses throughout the county; promptly summarized the advanced scientific experiences already created throughout the county and promoted them throughout the county; systematically studied the valuable cultural and scientific heritage circulating among the people and passed it on to the younger generation; and initially solved the problem of how county-level organs can lead and adapt to the cultural and technical revolution.

    以独创的精神　打破一切迷信　依靠自己力量
    孟津创办综合性红专大学
    哪里有专家、有创造发明、有经验，就把科设在哪里，就在哪里培养人材
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省孟津县以独创和革新的精神，打破了一切迷信和常规，依靠自己的力量，于本月初创办了一所综合性的红专大学。这所大学没有固定的校舍，也没有大学应有的一切设备，它的六个学院和四十二个科分设在县人民委员会直属各有关部门和全县各地，创造了教育和劳动相结合的典型。
    这所大学是在孟津县群众性的文化技术革命高潮中诞生的。全县群众在两个月中创办了一些农业大学和红专大学。这些学校成为农村一切活动的中心。孟津县综合红专大学的任务，不仅要帮助县直属机关的干部通过学习逐步达到又红又专的目的，以适应当前的客观形势，而且要把全县的文化技术革命推向一个新的更高的阶段。
    这所大学的正副校长分别由孟津县县长和中共县委宣传部长担任。农学院、工学院、财经学院、政教学院、医学院、师范学院六个学院，分设在党委和政府有关部门，如农学院设在县人民委员会农业局，政教学院设在县委宣传部。各院的学生就是各有关部门的干部。师资来源，强调因地制宜、就地取材。县委书记、县长、各部门负责干部和主要技术干部都是教员。但主要强调个人苦学苦钻，要求学员不要迷恋教室，要结合自己的业务，自己的试验田，到群众中去，参加劳动和工作，领导群众搞丰产田，搞技术革新，这是考核学员成绩的主要标志。
    这六个学院所属的四十二个科的分布情况，是中国教育史上没有的，它采取那里有专家、有创造、有发明、有经验，就把科设在那里，就在那里培育人材。例如：医学院的正骨科就设在平乐乡正骨医院，这个医院的正骨医生是全国闻名的正骨专家高云峰；农学院的棉花科就设在翟泉农业社，这个社有植棉能手、省农业劳动模范王木，王木现在正在培植亩产两千斤皮棉的高额丰产田。其他各科都是按照这个原则分设在全县各地。各科的学生，都是全县群众自办的红专大学、农业大学的系主任和技术员。学习时间不固定，多者两年，少者十天半月，主要是根据具体情况和当前的生产需要而定，如：目前急需要解决肥料问题，开课最早的化学科，半月内就培养了几百名细菌肥料技术员，现在全县都在搞细菌肥料。目前，这所大学已经有三个学院和所属的科开学了。
    这所只用了半个月的时间，没有花一文钱就办起来的大学，首先解决了全县群众已经办起来的学校的师资提高问题；把全县已经创造出来的先进的科学经验及时总结，在全县推广；把流传在民间的有价值的文化科学遗产，加以系统的研究，传给年青的一代；初步解决了县级机关如何领导适应文化技术革命的问题。
