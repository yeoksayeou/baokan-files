Our Nanchang correspondent, Li Jiuzhe, reports: In order to adapt to the rapidly developing local industry, relevant departments in Jiangxi Province are drastically improving the management system and various rules and regulations.

Recently, the Shangrao Prefectural Office submitted 500 industrial capital construction projects to the Jiangxi Provincial Planning Commission for approval at once, requesting the approval to be as quick as possible, saying that they had the funds and manpower ready, only lacking the approval. This situation is becoming more and more common, and the Planning Commission feels unable to cope. Recently, in studying the General Line, relevant departments studied the above problems, believing that this belongs to the relationship between the superstructure and the economic base, and how the relations of production should adapt to the development of productive forces. Therefore, according to the spirit of the General Line, they are actively working to improve the work of state organs and various rules and regulations to adapt to the current situation of great industrial development.

The reason why the Jiangxi Provincial Planning Commission felt it difficult to cope was because since the call for the whole party and the whole people to run industry was put forward, factories were being built everywhere, and planning work could no longer be managed by the method of "one pole to the bottom." At the same time, with the great development of industry in prefectures, counties, and townships, the balance and arrangement of industrial plans in each region could not be entirely managed by a single provincial planning commission. In view of this situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Planning Commission decided to improve the existing planning system, determine the prefectural office as a level of planning agency, and implement hierarchical management of planning. From now on, the plans of all enterprises and institutions in a region will be balanced and arranged by the local planning departments; at the same time, the approval authority of prefectures, counties, and cities for capital construction projects will be expanded. When the Provincial Planning Commission improved this management system, it correctly solved the problem of the combination of the power of the province and the prefectures and counties. For example, the regulations on the approval authority of capital construction projects stipulate that large-scale projects requiring provincial investment for construction shall be approved by the Provincial Planning Commission, and those whose raw materials and product sales need to be balanced and controlled by the province shall also be uniformly arranged by the Provincial Planning Commission; all capital construction projects whose funds, raw materials, and product sales can be solved locally shall be approved by the prefectures and counties themselves, regardless of the amount of investment. In this way, the enthusiasm of the prefectures and counties is brought into play, and there is also the necessary centralized and unified management.

In studying the General Line, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance mobilized all cadres to debate and review one by one the various systems and regulations for allocating funds for capital construction, and put forward improvement plans. Subsequently, the Department of Finance further solicited opinions from relevant departments and jointly improved twelve rules and regulations with various departments. Originally, a capital construction project required five documents before funds could be allocated: a design task book, a technical design, a budget, a construction commencement approval document, and a quota notice. Now, the Department of Finance has simplified the five fund allocation procedures to require only a capital construction plan and a quota notice for fund allocation. In order to supply capital construction funds in a timely manner, the Department of Finance has also supplemented a new method, that is, if there is no Construction Bank in the location of the construction unit, the provincial branch will directly remit the funds and deliver the funds to the door, so as to ensure that the project starts on time. In the past, if there was no Construction Bank in the location of the construction unit, it would have to travel a long way to the location of the bank to request the allocation of funds. The "earmarked funds for special purposes" regulation, which the capital construction unit felt was the most restrictive, has also been changed. In the future, the Department of Finance and the Construction Bank will only control the total amount, and the specific projects will be controlled by the departments themselves, giving the capital construction unit a certain degree of flexibility in the use of funds. The Department of Finance made this modification based on the following: First, the capital construction units believe that the financial departments are too restrictive, which is not conducive to construction; second, after rectification, the awareness of cadres has been improved, the leadership of construction work has been strengthened, and funds will not be misappropriated casually, so specific projects can be controlled by the capital construction units themselves.

The Jiangxi Provincial Materials Supply Department and the Commercial Department have also made corresponding improvements in the management system and rules and regulations. In the past, the supply of materials was completely concentrated in a provincial agency. Now, with the development of local industry, the variety and quantity of materials required by prefectures and counties have increased rapidly, and the industrial products of prefectures and counties have also increased day by day. It is no longer appropriate for the supply of materials to be completely concentrated in the province. With the approval of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee, a materials supply agency at the prefectural and county level has now been established, responsible for the materials supply and product distribution of the prefectures and counties. The commercial departments have also recently improved the purchasing work of local industrial products, adjusted the purchasing prices of certain local industrial products based on the principle of supporting the development of local industry, and put forward the slogan "produce what you sell, produce as much as you sell," changing some unreasonable regulations in this regard in the past.

    适应地方工业飞跃发展的形势
    江西改进企业管理体制
    本报南昌27日电　记者李久泽报道：为了适应地方工业飞跃发展的形势，江西省有关部门大刀阔斧地改进管理体制和各种规章制度。
    日前，上饶专署一下子报来了五百个工业基本建设项目请江西省计划委员会审批，而且要求越快越好，说他们资金、人力都已具备，只欠批准。这种情况现在越来越多，计划委员会感到无法应付。最近在学习总路线中，有关部门研究了类似以上的问题，认为这是属于上层建筑与经济基础的关系问题，是生产关系如何适应生产力发展的问题，因此根据总路线的精神，积极着手改进国家机关工作，改进各种规章制度，以适应目前工业大发展的形势。
    江西省计划委员会所以感到难于应付，是因为自从提出全党全民办工业的号召以后，到处都在兴办工厂，计划工作已经无法用“一竿子插到底”的办法来管理了。同时，在专县乡工业大发展的情况下，每个地区的工业计划的平衡和安排，省的一个计划委员会也是无法全部管起来的。鉴于这种情况，江西省计划委员会决定改进现有的计划体制，确定专署为一级计划机构，实行计划分级管理。凡一个地区的全部企业、事业单位的计划，今后全由当地计划部门平衡和安排；同时，扩大专县市对基本建设项目的审批权限。省计划委员会在改进这一管理体制的时候，正确地解决了省和专县的权力的结合问题。例如，关于基建项目的审批权限中规定：凡是需要省投资兴建的规模较大的工程，由省计划委员会审批，若干原材料和产品销路需要由省统一平衡掌握的，也由省计划委员会统一安排；凡资金、原材料和产品销路均可就地解决的基建项目，不论投资大小，一律由专县自己审批。这样，既发扬了专县的积极性，又有必要的集中统一的管理。
    江西省财政厅在学习总路线中，发动全体干部就基本建设拨款的各种制度和规定进行辩论和逐一审查，提出了改进方案。随后，财政厅又向有关部门进一步征求意见，并和各部门共同改进了十二项规章制度。原来，一项基本建设工程，要有设计任务书、技术设计、预算、开工批准文件、限额通知书五种文件才能拨款。现在财政厅把五种拨款手续简化为只要有基建计划和限额通知书就拨款。为了及时供应基建资金，财政厅还补充制定了一项新的办法，即建设单位所在地如果没有建设银行，省行就采取直汇资金、把资金送上门的办法，以保证工程按时开工。在过去，建设单位所在地如没有建设银行，那得跑很多路到银行所在地去请求拨款。基本建设单位感到束缚最大的“专款专用”的规定也改了，以后财政厅及建设银行只控制总额，具体项目由各部门自行掌握，给基建单位使用资金一定的机动权。财政厅作这种修改的根据是：一、各基建单位认为财政部门卡得太死，不利于建设；二、经过整风以后干部觉悟提高了，建设工作的领导加强了，不会随便挪用资金，因此具体项目可以让基建单位自行掌握。
    江西省物资供应部门和商业部门，在管理体制及规章制度方面也作了相应的改进。过去，物资供应完全集中在省的一个机构，现在随着地方工业的发展，专县所需物资的品种和数量迅速增加，专县工业产品也日益增多，物资供应工作就不宜再完全集中在省里。经江西省人民委员会批准，现在成立了专县一级的物资供应机构，负责专县的物资供应和产品分配工作。商业部门最近还改进了对地方工业产品的收购工作，本着支援地方工业发展的原则调整了某些地方工业产品的收购价格，提出“生产什么销售什么，生产多少销售多少”的口号，改变了这方面过去某些不合理的规定。
