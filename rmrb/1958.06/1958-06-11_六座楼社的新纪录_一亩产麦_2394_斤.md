    New Record for the Liuzuolou Cooperative
    2394 Jin of Wheat Per Mu
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) According to the Hebei Daily: The Youth Leap Forward Team of the Sixth Production Team of the Liuzuolou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Beizhang Township, Weixian County, planted six mu of high-yield wheat and created a high-yield record averaging 1,057 jin per mu. The single harvest and single threshing result of one mu of high-yield field reached 2,394 jin. During the harvesting, Wu Kun, First Secretary of the Weixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chang Linshan, Deputy Secretary of the County Supervisory Committee, Chen Siqin of the League Prefectural Committee, and Zhu Jian of the League County Committee and other comrades went to the site for inspection and acceptance.
    This high-yield field was cultivated jointly by Li Xiuping, the deputy director of the cooperative, Han Jin, and the youth team. This mu of high-yield wheat was first irrigated with canal water, deep-plowed to a depth of eight cun, and harrowed three times. Each mu was applied with 22,000 jin of base fertilizer, sown with 25 jin of Bima No. 1 superior seeds, with a sowing width of three cun and a row spacing of eight cun. After tillering, each mu reached more than 768,000 plants. A total of four topdressings were applied before and after the Spring Festival. The first time, 16,000 jin of livestock manure and 15,000 jin of human manure and urine were applied before freezing. The second time, 3,000 jin of livestock manure, 180 jin of cake fertilizer, and 150 jin of ammonium nitrate were applied when the wheat turned green. The third time, 6,000 jin of livestock manure, 200 jin of cake fertilizer, 100 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 150 jin of ash fertilizer were applied when the wheat jointed. The fourth time, 70 jin of chemical fertilizer and 120 jin of cake fertilizer were applied when the wheat headed, and two jin of phosphorus were sprayed outside the roots. This mu of wheat was irrigated seven times from sowing to before harvest. The first time was to irrigate with pest control water after all the wheat emerged; the second time was to irrigate with winter water; the third time was to irrigate with greening water during the Spring Festival; the fourth time was to irrigate with jointing water; the fifth time was to irrigate with booting water; the sixth time was to irrigate with heading and flowering water; and the seventh time was to irrigate with grain-filling water. After each topdressing and irrigation, intertillage and weeding were carried out. Before the wheat was harvested, wooden poles were used to build frames to prevent lodging. By taking these measures, the high yield of wheat was guaranteed.

    六座楼社的新纪录
    一亩产麦2394斤
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：魏县北?乡六座楼村农业社第六生产队青年跃进小组，种了六亩丰产小麦，创造了平均亩产一千零五十七斤的高额丰产纪录。其中一亩高额丰产田单收单打的结果，达到二千三百九十四斤。在收打的时候，中共魏县县委第一书记武坤、县监察委员会副书记常林山、团地委陈思勤和团县委朱俭等同志曾到现场验收。
    这块丰产田是这个社的副主任李秀萍、韩金和青年小组共同培育的。这一亩高额丰产小麦先用渠水浇了一遍，深耕八寸，耙了三遍，每亩施底肥两万二千斤，播种碧蚂一号优种二十五斤，播幅三寸，行距八寸，经过分蘖，每亩达七十六万八千多棵。春节前后共追肥四次，第一次在封冻前盖牲口粪一万六千斤，人粪尿一万五千斤；第二次在小麦返青时，追牲口粪三千斤，饼肥一百八十斤，硝酸铵一百五十斤；第三次在小麦拔节时追牲口粪六千斤，饼肥二百斤，硫酸铵一百斤，草木灰一百五十斤；第四次在小麦抽穗时追化肥七十斤，饼肥一百二十斤，根外喷磷二斤。这亩小麦从播种到收获前浇了七次水，第一次小麦出齐后浇镇虫水，第二次浇冬水，第三次春节时浇返青水，第四次浇拔节水，第五次浇孕穗水，第六次浇抽穗扬花水，第七次浇灌浆水。每次追肥和浇水以后，都进行了中耕和除草。在小麦收割前，为了防止倒伏，又全部用木棍搭了架。经过采取这些措施，保证了小麦高额丰产。
