Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 22nd: The European Trade Union and Workers' Conference Against Atomic Threat and for Peace victoriously concluded on the afternoon of the 22nd after three days of meetings. A series of documents passed at the conference by more than 300 trade union representatives from 23 European countries demonstrated the firm will of the working people of various European countries to oppose atomic threats, strive for disarmament, and strive for peace.

    The appeal to the working people and trade unions of various European countries, passed by the conference, called on workers and trade unions throughout Europe to hold a "Week of Struggle and Solidarity for Peace and Disarmament" from October 15th to 22nd this year.

    In an open letter to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, the conference welcomed the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing and demanded that the US and UK governments also cease nuclear testing. It called on the three major powers to reach an agreement quickly on the issue of an immediate, universal, and supervised cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    In addition, the conference issued an open letter to scientists around the world calling on them to participate in the above-mentioned week of struggle and solidarity, and suggested that all international trade union organizations and the World Federation of Scientific Workers conclude an agreement to cooperate and jointly safeguard peace.

    Furthermore, the conference also passed a letter to the working people and trade union leaders of the United States, an appeal to the trade unions and working people of Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania, a letter to the trade unions and working people of West Germany, a statement on the conference for disarmament and international cooperation, an appeal to European farmers, and statements of solidarity with workers in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, and Algeria.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 22nd: Ma Chun-ku, the observer from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) at the European Trade Union and Workers' Conference Against Atomic Threat and for Peace, delivered a speech at the conference on the 22nd. Ma Chun-ku said that the ACFTU and the Chinese working class warmly welcome and support the convening of the European Trade Union Conference.

    Ma Chun-ku said that imperialists are currently preparing for war, carrying out atomic threats, and stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan, but their internal difficulties and contradictions are deepening day by day. Life and practice have repeatedly proven that the seemingly powerful American imperialism is actually outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Any underestimation or overestimation of the forces of imperialism is unnecessary and harmful.

    Ma Chun-ku said that the Chinese people have always believed that peace is indivisible. The Chinese workers and 600 million people will always unite closely with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people, and resolutely support the struggle of the European workers and people to safeguard peace. We believe that our just cause of safeguarding peace will, after repeated and arduous struggles, surely achieve great victory.

    欧洲各国工会代表会议呼吁美英两国停止核试验
    欧洲工人阶级决心堵塞战争道路
    我全总代表说中国人民坚决支持欧洲工人的斗争
    据新华社柏林22日电  欧洲各国工会和工人反对原子威胁和争取和平会议在举行了三天会议之后，已在22日下午胜利结束。来自二十三个欧洲国家的三百多位工会代表在会上通过的一系列文件，显示了欧洲各国劳动人民反对原子威胁、争取裁军和争取和平的坚决意志。
    会议通过的致欧洲各国劳动人民和工会的呼吁书，号召全欧洲的工人和工会在今年10月15日到22日举行“争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周”。
    在致美国、英国和苏联政府的公开信中，会议表示欢迎苏联单方面停止核武器试验的决定，同时要求美、英两国政府停止核试验。它呼吁三大国就立即、普遍、有监督地停止核武器试验问题迅速达成协议。
    会议还在致全世界科学家的公开信中呼吁他们参加上述的斗争和团结周，并且建议一切国际工会组织和世界科学工作者协会缔结一项进行合作和共同维护和平的协议。
    此外，会议还通过了致美国劳动人民和工会领导人的信，致亚洲、非洲、美洲和大洋洲的工会和劳动人民的呼吁书，致西德工会和劳动人民的信，关于争取裁军和国际合作大会的声明，致欧洲农民的呼吁书，以及声援西班牙、葡萄牙、塞浦路斯和阿尔及利亚等国工人的声明。
    据新华社柏林22日电  中华全国总工会出席欧洲各国工会和工人反对原子威胁、争取和平会议的观察员马纯古22日在会上发表讲话，马纯古说，中华全国总工会和中国工人阶级热烈欢迎和支持欧洲工会代表会议的召开。
    马纯古说，帝国主义者目前正在准备战争、进行原子威胁、加紧武装西德和日本，但是它们内部的困难和矛盾正日益加深。生活实践已经一再证明：貌似强大的美国帝国主义实际上是外强中干的。一切对帝国主义力量的过低或过高的估计都是不必要的和有害的。
    马纯古说，中国人民一向认为和平是不可分割的。中国工人和六亿人民将永远同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民紧密地团结在一起，坚决地支持欧洲工人和人民维护和平的斗争。我们相信，我们维护和平的正义事业经过反复顽强的斗争，一定能够得到伟大的胜利。
