Reform Funeral Customs, Advocate Cremation and Simple Burial, Tombs but not Graves
Zhao Jianmin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Funeral customs are a part of the superstructure of society. Like other social superstructures, they are produced on a certain economic base and social system and serve this economic base and social system. They will inevitably change with the transformation of the social economic base. We have successfully built a series of superstructures that adapt to the socialist economic base. This kind of superstructure is conducive to the current development of socialist production, and it serves our current socialist economic base. However, it must be admitted that some of the superstructures we have built are not yet complete, and some feudal and capitalist remnants of the superstructure have not been broken or replaced by our new superstructure. They are still in contradiction with the new economic base, hindering the development of current productive forces. The old funeral customs that currently dominate the lives of the broad masses of rural people fall into this category.

Old funeral customs have become a heavy burden on the masses in terms of spirit and material, seriously hindering the development of socialist construction.

The current rural funeral customs, although impacted and changed after several years since liberation, and simplified and modified by the people with the improvement of their consciousness; but because we have not systematically reformed them with a planned leadership, these old feudal remnants of funeral customs have not been thoroughly reformed. Their feudal superstitious content and old clan moral views are still a serious spiritual pressure on the working people. At present, when parents and elders die, the rural masses generally still follow the old feudal superstitious rituals, such as reporting to the temple to lead the soul, thick burial with wooden coffins, feasting relatives and friends, and excessive memorial days. Some people, if they violate these old funeral rituals, violate the practice of thick burial with wooden coffins, will be condemned by relatives, friends, and even public opinion. This old funeral custom has become a heavy burden on the masses in terms of spirit and material, seriously hindering the development of socialist production and construction. For example, the tomb system not only causes a serious waste of land, but also creates great difficulties for land consolidation, farmland water conservancy construction, and the use of new agricultural tools (especially tractors). In terms of thick burial with wooden coffins and feudal superstitious rituals, it has caused a serious waste of wood, cotton cloth, paper, and money. As Marx said in the Communist Manifesto: "The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air." Therefore, it is very necessary to reform the old feudal superstitious funeral customs and establish a new set of funeral customs that are compatible with the socialist system and economic base, especially in today's great leap in production, it feels even more urgent.

Since the beginning of agricultural cooperativization in Shandong Province in early 1956, it has begun to work on the issue of reforming funeral customs, conducting some investigation and research work. Work groups were organized to go to Liaocheng, Linyi, Laiyang, Huimin, Jining and other special districts, and selected plains, mountainous areas, lakeside areas, and urban suburbs to conduct typical investigations in 18 townships and towns; at the same time, symposiums were held with relevant provincial departments, historical experts, cultural and historical museum staff, and counselors to conduct several studies on the situation and problems of funeral customs. From the investigation and research, it was felt that this was an important problem that could not be ignored and must be solved. According to the survey of eighteen townships and towns: (1) There are currently 74,698 existing graves, occupying 3,202 mu of cultivated land, accounting for 1.98% of the total cultivated land area. If the area of the cemetery around the grave is added, it accounts for more than 3% of the total cultivated land area, and all are good land. The area of cultivated land occupied by existing graves is the largest in the urban suburbs, such as Chengdongguan in Laiyang County, which is 7.2%; generally, mountainous areas and plains are 3.5%-4%; the least is the lakeside area, which is 0.11%. According to the above estimate, the existing graves in the province account for at least 3% of the total cultivated land area, and the occupied cultivated land is about 4.17 million mu. Assuming that the average annual output per mu is 300 jin, the province reduces grain by more than 1.25 billion jin each year, which is equivalent to the rations for more than 3.2 million people for one year. According to the statistics of the Provincial Bureau of Statistics from 1952 to 1956, the average annual mortality rate in Shandong Province was 1.2%. According to this number, the province has 644,000 deaths each year, of which about 80%, or 515,200 people, need graves besides infants. The new graves added each year occupy 5,152 mu, which reduces grain by more than 1.54 million jin. Therefore, reforming the burial system and competing with graves for land is particularly important. (2) According to the above estimate, 80% of the annual deaths in the province, or 515,200 people, need coffins. Each coffin requires at least 0.4 cubic meters of wood. In this way, the province needs 206,080 cubic meters of wood for coffins each year. This wood can build more than 200,000 ordinary houses, and can supply more than 2,000 kilometers of railway sleepers. Due to the shortage of wood, the price of coffins is very high. The cheapest coffin costs 50 yuan, the average costs about 100 yuan, and the most expensive costs 600 yuan. (3) According to the survey and statistics of Jiuzhai Township, Mengyin County, in the past three years, an average of 48 chi of cloth and 3 jin of linters are used for making longevity clothes for each deceased person. According to this number, the province uses 24.73 million chi of cotton cloth and 1.5456 million jin of linters for making longevity clothes each year. (4) According to the survey, the average cost of funeral expenses is at least about 100 yuan (including coffins, longevity clothes, and other various funeral expenses). According to this number, the province spends about 51.5 million yuan on funeral expenses each year.

This serious waste of land, wood, cotton cloth, and money is a heavy burden on both cooperatives and individuals. Due to the constraints of this feudal funeral custom, both in the past and present, it has caused great difficulties for the masses. There are many cases of production and life difficulties and family bankruptcy caused by funerals.

The masses have suffered from the disasters brought by feudal etiquette, and urgently demand the reform of old funeral customs, hoping that the Party and the government will put forward a new set of methods.

Precisely because the people have suffered from the disasters brought by feudal etiquette, with the establishment of the socialist system and the foundation of the collective economy, and the great improvement of political consciousness, they urgently demand the reform of old funeral customs. The masses generally feel that the old funeral customs are wasteful, superstitious, and cumbersome, but they suffer from the lack of new methods to replace them. Some people feel that if they do not follow the old methods, they are afraid of being criticized by relatives and friends. Therefore, they very much hope that the Party and the government can set a new set of methods. For example, the masses reflected: "Old graves are all over the place, and new graves are added every year. There is less and less land. It is impossible if the higher authorities do not come up with a solution." Some said: "Good land is occupied by the dead. Do the living still not eat?" Many agricultural cooperatives proposed: "To compete with the heaven for height, to compete with graves for land, to fight a decisive battle with nature, not to ask for gods, not to rely on heaven, but to rely entirely on our own hands to ensure increased production." Some said: "When a person dies, it is like a lamp goes out. Burning incense and paper and talking about feng shui is superstition. With cooperatives, both people and wealth are prosperous. There is nothing to be afraid of. If you want to talk about feng shui, the Communist Party and cooperatives are good feng shui." Therefore, with the great improvement of the masses' awareness, with the needs of production and life, there are examples of flattening graves and reclaiming land everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from six townships including Maguantun Township in Liaocheng County and Jiuzhai Township in Mengyin County in 1957 alone, 952 graves (mostly ownerless graves) were flattened, and the cultivated land area was expanded by nearly 100 mu. And many people have formally proposed to the government through the People's Congress and people's letters. In October 1957, Wang Dianchang, a farmer from Wangjiamiao Village, Mengzhuang Township, Liaocheng County, wrote to Chairman Mao, suggesting the construction of a people's tomb hall. He compiled the reasons into a ballad: "If you want the country to be strong, you must build a people's tomb hall. Big trees will not be used to make coffins in the future, and the wood will be used to build factories. No tombs should be built on good land, and more grain should be harvested from the land saved. Ancestors are not buried underground, and will not suffer waves in the ground. From now on, we plan to live in high-rise buildings, and we will never sleep on soil mounds again. The people's tomb hall must be built well, and it will add glory to the country. When the Qingming Festival arrives, the gongs and drums will sound happily. Everyone stands together and bows three times. The ancestors are happy to die." Under the encouragement of the socialist system, in order to develop production and improve life as soon as possible, the people spontaneously reformed or made suggestions on the old feudal remnants of funeral customs. This is inevitable and correct. We also encouraged and supported it in the past. However, because our leadership ideology lags behind objective reality, we underestimate the consciousness of the masses, have many concerns, and dare not boldly and publicly advocate and publicize it. We lack organizational leadership and have not put forward specific reform measures. Therefore, the reform of the old funeral customs is not great and the progress is not fast.

Now the conditions are ripe, and we should actively and step by step lead the masses to reform the old funeral customs, and at the same time establish a new set of funeral customs that are compatible with the socialist system and economic base.

Based on the above situation, I think the time has come and the conditions are ripe, and we should actively and step by step lead the masses to reform the old funeral customs. While reforming the old funeral customs, we should establish a new set of funeral customs that are compatible with the socialist system and economic base. The new funeral customs we advocate are essentially different from the old funeral customs. The old funeral customs serve the exploiting classes, fool the people, and instill feudal superstitious ideas into the people, such as the so-called "people have souls, and the souls of the dead are still there", "filial piety is supreme", and so on. And our funeral customs serve socialist production and construction, commemorate the deceased, spur and encourage the living, and use communist moral standards to educate the people. We advocate filial piety. We should take care of and love the elderly and our elders when they are alive, so that their old age can be comforted and their lives can be relied on. At the same time, after their death, we should also express our condolences and commemorate them. We should encourage future generations to learn from their advantages and achievements, so as to achieve the positive purpose of encouraging future generations and turning grief into strength. On this issue, Chairman Mao clearly instructed in his speech "Serving the People" at the meeting convened by the directly affiliated organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1944 to commemorate Comrade Zhang Side: "In the future, whoever dies in our ranks, whether it is a cook or a soldier, as long as he has done some useful work, we should hold a funeral and hold a memorial service for him. This should become a system. This method should also be introduced to the people. When people in the village die, hold a memorial service. Use this method to express our condolences and unite the entire people."

Regarding the practice and methods of reforming the old and establishing new funeral customs, according to the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with specific practice, and according to Marx's famous saying in Capital that "the same—the same in the main conditions—economic basis can still have countless different empirical events, natural conditions, racial relations, various historical influences caused by external effects, and so on, and show endless variations and levels in the phenomenon," I feel that in addition to criticizing and abolishing those feudal superstitious contents that violate thrift and hinder production and construction in the old funeral customs, we should also see that the old funeral customs have a history of thousands of years, and have formed a habitual force among the masses. Therefore, for some non-essential phenomena and forms, we can also give full play to the creativity of the masses, adopt diverse reform methods according to the historical customs and natural conditions of the masses, so that the masses can easily accept them and facilitate their promotion among the broad masses.

Specific reform method suggestions: abolish wooden coffins; deep burial and simple burial, tombs but not graves; dispose of existing graves; gradually promote cremation.

Specific reform method suggestions:
Regarding the abolition of wooden coffins. We can first universally promote substitute coffins. That is, to replace the commonly used wooden coffins with new-style coffins made of wood frames, straw materials, reeds, or other materials. Now the Provincial Forestry Department has trial-produced two types of substitute coffins: one type is mainly for new burials. That is, a small amount of wood is used as the skeleton, and the four walls are made of sorghum straw and reeds, and then plastered with lime or lime-soil mixture. The form is beautiful, the same as the old coffins, taking care of the habits of the masses. The advantages are: saving wood, the wood of one coffin can make five or six substitute coffins; and it is economical and durable, and the average cost of each substitute coffin is about ten yuan, which is as strong as a wooden coffin. The second type is mainly for relocation burials. It is made of ceramic materials, with two shapes: box-shaped and jar-shaped, both with lids. The average cost of each is about five yuan (if it is changed to be made of straw, the cost can be greatly reduced). In addition, we can also consider mobilizing the masses not to use coffins, and adopt burial methods such as earth pits, brick pits, and stone pits. When the conditions are ripe, the substitute coffins can be completely abandoned.

Regarding the promotion of deep burial and simple burial, tombs but not graves. Under the unified planning of the local government or cooperative, a part of the thin land or mountains that do not hinder production and construction can be selected as public cemeteries, buried deeply in the flat ground, tombs but not graves, and signs or trees can be planted on the graves or on the side of the road at a certain distance as memorial signs. Crops can still be planted as usual on the graves, or trees can be planted and orchards can be established in a planned way. This can both green the environment, beautify the cemetery, and increase income. In mountainous and hilly areas, burial methods such as digging holes can be adopted without affecting cultivation and tree planting.

Disposing of existing graves. Graves without owners or graves older than five generations can be mobilized by the masses to be leveled; for graves with owners within five generations that hinder production and construction, they can be leveled or moved on the basis of voluntary participation after education to expand the area of cultivated land.

The tombs of martyrs and ancient tombs with historical or cultural value should be properly protected. Modern people who have made special contributions to society, model workers, and advanced figures from all walks of life, if the masses request to build tombs, plant trees, and carve stones as a memorial after their death, should be agreed to and assisted in carrying out.

Cremation should be gradually and selectively promoted. First, crematoriums should be established in cities and areas with developed culture and high mass awareness to promote cremation.

Advocate frugal and easy funeral customs. Several sets of new funeral customs should be formulated according to communist moral standards and in combination with local conditions. For example: advocate preserving portraits and relics, compiling wills and resumes to commemorate the deceased. Cadres, employees, workers, and farmers who die can hold memorial services according to the situation in units such as agencies, factories, workshops, or streets, and in rural areas in units such as societies or teams. The deceased should not wear longevity clothes, but can wear whatever they have on hand. The descendants and relatives of the deceased should not wear mourning clothes, but can wear black or white gauze, or they can continue to use the method of edging white on their clothes. The memorial days should be greatly reduced, and two or three memorial days such as Qingming and Spring Festival can be selected each year according to local customs. For sacrifices, advocate bowing and silent mourning, and gradually change the habit of kowtowing.

In ethnic minorities, the reform of funeral customs should be cautious. In some places, the reform can be delayed, and ethnic minorities can reform them according to their own customs.

When we conducted surveys in the urban suburbs of Laiyang County and Heluo Township, we publicized the above methods of reforming funeral customs. The masses not only accepted them but also welcomed them very much (only most farmers temporarily found cremation difficult to accept). They said that reforming funeral customs has four major benefits: First, it expands cultivated land and increases output; second, it does not affect water conservancy construction and tractor farming; third, it saves capital and invests it in production and construction; fourth, it eliminates feudal superstitious ideas.

For the sake of prudence, all of the above methods need to be piloted first, gain experience, and then be promoted after being revised and supplemented by the masses. Whether in pilot projects or in promotion, ideological work must be done well, the masses must be fully mobilized, the principle of voluntariness must be implemented, and anyone who does not want to accept the new methods should be allowed to handle them according to his old methods. During pilot projects or promotion, it must be carried out around the central work of production rectification. In short, reforming the old and establishing new funeral customs has become the urgent demand of the broad masses. Our Party should further strengthen leadership and promotion. I believe that after conducting pilot projects and gaining experience, and then widely promoting them in the Han areas, we can enable the broad masses of people to quickly, well, and economically relieve the heavy spiritual and material burdens formed by the old funeral customs, and a new situation will appear in ideology and production.

    改革丧葬礼俗　提倡废棺薄葬墓而不坟
    中共山东省委书记处书记　赵健民
    丧葬礼俗是社会上层建筑的一部分，它和其它社会上层建筑一样，是在一定的经济基础和社会制度上产生出来并为这个经济基础和社会制度服务的，它必然随着社会经济基础的变革而变革。我们已经成功地建成了一系列的适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，这种上层建筑，有助于当前社会主义生产的发展，它为我们当前的社会主义经济基础服务。但是应当承认，我们目前建成的上层建筑，有的还不完备，有的封建主义资本主义残留的上层建筑还未被我们新的上层建筑所打破所代替，它仍在与新的经济基础发生矛盾，阻碍当前生产力的发展。现时支配广大农村人民生活的旧丧葬礼俗即属于这一范畴。
    旧的丧葬礼俗已成为群众在精神上物质上的沉重负担，严重地妨碍着社会主义建设的发展。
    现时农村的丧葬礼俗，虽经解放后几年来的冲击变化，人民群众随着觉悟的提高而加以简化和修改；但由于我们还未有有计划地加以领导，还未有有系统地加以改革，所以这种旧的封建残余的丧葬礼俗，尚未得到彻底的改革，它的封建迷信的内容和旧的宗法道德观点，仍然相当严重的成为劳动人民的精神压力。目前农村群众，当父母老人死亡时，一般仍沿用旧的封建迷信仪式，如报庙引魂、木棺厚葬、宴请亲友、祭日过多等等。有的如果违犯这些旧的丧葬仪式，违犯木棺厚葬的做法，则会受到亲友以至社会舆论的谴责，这种旧的丧葬礼俗已成为群众在精神上物质上的沉重负担，严重地妨碍着社会主义生产建设的发展。例如坟墓制度，它不仅造成了土地的严重浪费，而且给土地连片、农田水利建设和新式农具（特别是拖拉机）的使用等，造成了很大困难。在木棺厚葬封建迷信仪式方面，则造成了木材、棉布、纸张和金钱的严重浪费。诚如马克思在共产党宣言中所说的：“无产阶级是现代社会中最下层的阶级，它若不把压在它头上而由组成正式社会的那些阶层所构成的全部上层建筑物抛出九霄云外，便不能伸腰，便不能抬头”。因此，改革旧的封建迷信的丧葬礼俗，建立一套同社会主义制度和经济基础相适应的新的丧葬礼俗是非常必要的，尤其是在生产大跃进的今天，更感到迫不及待。
    山东地区，在1956年初农业合作化以后，就开始着手对改革丧葬礼俗的问题，进行了一些调查研究工作。曾组织工作组到聊城、临沂、莱阳、惠民、济宁等专区，选择了平原、山区、沿湖和城市郊区，作了十八个乡、镇的典型调查；同时，召集了省级有关部门、史学专家、文史馆员及参事等人员的座谈会，对丧葬礼俗的情况和问题进行了几次研究。从调查研究的情况看，感到这是一个不可忽视和必须解决的大问题。据十八个乡、镇的调查；（1）现有坟头七万四千六百九十八个，占用耕地三千二百零二亩，占耕地总面积的1.98％，如果加上坟头四周占用的茔地面积，则占耕地总面积的3％以上，且都是良好的土地。现有坟头占耕地面积最多的是城镇郊区，如莱阳县城东关为7.2％；一般的是山区和平原为3.5％—4％；最少的是沿湖区为0.11％。据上推算，全省现有坟墓至少占总耕地面积的3％，占用的耕地约有四百一十七万亩左右。每亩常年产量平均按三百斤计算，每年全省约减少粮食十二亿五千多万斤，相等于三百二十多万人口一年的口粮。根据省统计局1952年到1956年的统计，山东全省人口每年平均死亡率为1.2％，按此数推算，全省每年要死亡六十四万四千人，其中除了婴儿以外，约有80％的即五十一万五千二百人需要坟墓，一年光增加的新坟墓就要占地五千一百五十二亩，约减少粮食一百五十四万多斤。由此可见，改革墓葬制度，与坟墓争地，就显得特别重要。（2）根据上数推算，全省每年死亡人口中要有80％的即五十一万五千二百人要用棺材，每个棺材最低需用零点四立方米的木材，这样，全省每年用于棺材的木材就需二十万零六千零八十立方米。这些木材可建筑平房二十多万间，可供应二千多公里的铁路枕木。由于木材的紧张，棺材价格很高，最贱的棺材需要五十元，一般的需一百元左右，最贵的则需六百元。（3）据蒙阴县旧寨乡近三年的调查统计，平均每个死人做寿衣用布四十八尺，皮棉三斤。按此数推算，全省每年用做寿衣的棉布二千四百七十三万尺，皮棉一百五十四万五千六百斤。（4）据调查，平均每起治丧费用最低约需一百元（包括棺材、寿衣和其它各种治丧费用）。按此数计算，全省每年用于治丧费用约五千一百五十多万元。
    这些土地、木材、棉布和金钱的严重浪费情况，对合作社和个人都是一项沉重的负担。由于这种封建丧葬礼俗的束缚，不论在过去和现在，都给群众造成了很大的困难，因丧事造成生产生活困苦和家庭破产的事例是很多的。
    群众饱受封建礼俗给予的灾难，迫切要求改革旧的丧葬礼俗，希望党和政府提出一套新的办法。
    正因为人民群众饱受了封建礼俗给予的灾难，所以随着社会主义制度和集体经济基础的建立，政治觉悟大大提高，迫切要求改革旧的丧葬礼俗。群众对旧的丧葬礼俗，较普遍地感到浪费、迷信、烦琐，但又苦于没有新的办法来代替，部分人感到不按旧办法执行，怕受到亲友指责，因此很希望党与政府能定出一套新办法来。如群众反映：“旧坟堆满地是，新坟堆年年增加，土地越来越少，上级不想个办法是不行的。”有的说：“好好的土地叫死人占去了，活人还吃不吃饭？”不少农业社提出：“要和天公比高低，要和坟墓争土地，要和大自然决战，不求神，不靠天，全靠双手保增产”。有的说：“人死如灯灭，烧香烧纸讲风水是迷信，有了合作社人财两旺，什么都不怕，要讲风水，共产党、合作社就是好风水”。因此，在群众觉悟大大提高的情况下，随着生产和生活的需要，各地都有平坟墓开垦土地的事例。仅据聊城县马官屯乡、蒙阴县旧寨乡等六个乡1957年不完全的统计，就平掉坟墓（大部是无主墓）九百五十二个，扩大耕地面积近百亩。并且有不少人民群众通过人民代表大会和人民来信向政府提出正式建议。1957年10月，聊城县孟庄乡王家庙村农民王殿昌上书毛主席，建议修盖民墓堂，他把理由编成了歌谣：“要想国家建设强，必须要盖民墓堂。大树今后不造棺，拿下木材修工厂。好地之上不筑墓，节出地来多打粮。祖先不在地下埋，不在地里受波浪，从今计划住高楼，再也不去睡土岗。民墓堂来要盖好，又为国家来增光，到了清明纪念日，锣鼓打起喜洋洋，大家齐立三鞠躬，祖先死去喜心肠”。人民群众在社会主义制度的鼓舞下，为了尽快地发展生产改善生活，对旧有的封建残余的丧葬礼俗，自发地进行改革或者提出建议，这是必然的、正确的。我们过去也是鼓励和支持的。但是，由于我们领导思想落后于客观实际，对群众的觉悟估计不足，顾虑重重，不敢大胆地公开地提倡和宣传，缺乏组织领导，没有提出具体改革办法，因而对旧丧葬礼俗的改革不大，进展不快。
    现在条件已经成熟，应该积极地有步骤地领导群众改革旧的丧葬礼俗，同时建立一套同社会主义制度和经济基础相适应的新的丧葬礼俗。
    根据上述情况，我认为时机已到，条件已成熟，应该积极地有步骤地领导群众改革旧的丧葬礼俗。在改革旧丧葬礼俗的同时，应该建立一套同社会主义制度和经济基础相适应的新的丧葬礼俗。我们所提倡的新的丧葬礼俗同旧的丧葬礼俗有本质的区别。旧的丧葬礼俗是为剥削阶级服务的，是愚弄人民的，是向人民灌输封建迷信思想的，如所谓“人有灵魂，人死灵魂在”，“孝道至上”等等。而我们的丧葬礼俗是为社会主义的生产建设服务的，是为了纪念死者，鞭策和鼓励生者，是用共产主义的道德标准去教育人民的。我们是主张孝道的，对老年人、自己的尊长，在他们生前应该照顾和爱护，使他们的晚年得到安慰，生活上有所指靠；同时，在他们死后，也完全应该表示我们的哀悼和纪念，对他们的优点成绩要勉励后人学习，达到鼓励后代，化悲痛为力量的积极目的。对这个问题，毛主席在1944年中共中央直属机关为追悼张思德同志而召集的会议上所作的“为人民服务”的讲演中，就明确地指示过：“今后我们的队伍里，不管死了谁，不管是炊事员，是战士，只要他是做过一些有益的工作的，我们都要给他送葬，开追悼会。这要成为一个制度。这个方法也要介绍到老百姓那里去。村上的人死了，开个追悼会。用这样的方法，寄托我们的哀思，使整个人民团结起来”。
    关于改革旧的建立新的丧葬礼俗的做法和办法问题，根据马列主义普遍真理和具体实践相结合的原则，根据马克思在资本论中所说的“同一——就主要条件说同一的——经济基础，仍然可以有无数不同的经验上的事情，自然条件，种族关系，各种由外部发生作用的历史影响等等，而在现象上显示出无穷无尽的变异和等级差别。”的名言，我感到：对旧的丧葬礼俗除了批判和废除那些封建迷信、违背勤俭节约和妨害生产建设的主要内容以外，同时还应看到，旧的丧葬礼俗已有几千年的历史，在群众中已经形成了一种习惯力量，因此对于一些非本质的现象形式等，也可以根据群众的历史风俗习惯和自然条件等，多方发挥群众的创造，因地制宜地采用多种多样的改革办法，使群众容易接受，便于在广大群众中推广。
    具体改革办法的意见：废除木棺；深埋薄葬，墓而不坟；处理原有坟墓；逐步推行火葬。
    具体改革办法的意见：
    关于废除木棺问题。可以先普遍推行代用棺。就是把现时习惯使用的木棺改以木架秸料芦苇或其它材料制成的新式棺去代替。现在我省林业厅已经试制了两类代用棺：一类主要是为新葬用的。就是用少量的木材做骨干，四壁用秫秸芦苇，再用石灰或三合土涂抹做成。形式美观，与旧棺材相同，照顾了群众的习惯。其好处是：节约木材，一个棺材的木材能做五、六个代用棺；并且经济耐用，每个代用棺平均成本十元左右，坚固和木棺相等。二类主要是为迁葬用的。用陶瓷材料做成，有箱形、罐形两种，都有盖子。每个平均成本五元左右（如改为秸料制成则成本更可大量降低）。此外，还可以酝酿动员群众不用棺材，采用土坑、砖坑、石坑等安葬办法。待条件成熟时，代用棺即可全部废弃。
    关于推广深埋薄葬，墓而不坟的办法。可以在当地政府或合作社的统一规划下，选择一部分不妨碍生产建设的薄地或山岭作为公墓场，平地深埋，墓而不坟，在坟上或在一定距离的路边插牌或植树等办法作为纪念标志，坟上面仍可以照常种庄稼，或有计划地种植树木、建立果园。这样既绿化环境、美化墓地，又可以增加收入。在山区、丘陵区，在不影响耕种植树的情况下可以采取掏洞填葬的办法。
    处理原有墓坟。对无主坟或五代以上的坟墓可以动员群众平毁；妨碍生产建设五代以内的有主坟，经过教育，在群众自愿的基础上平毁或迁移，以扩大耕地面积。
    对于烈士陵墓和有历史价值或文物价值的古坟，应该加以妥善保护。对社会有特殊贡献的现代人士，工农模范以及各界先进人物，死后群众要求筑坟植树刻石作纪念者，则应同意并协助进行。
    要逐步地有重点地推行火葬。首先在城市和文化发达、群众觉悟高的地区，建立火葬场，推行火葬。
    提倡俭易的丧葬礼俗。应根据共产主义的道德标准，结合当地情况，拟定几套新的丧葬礼俗。譬如：提倡保存遗像、遗物，编整遗言、简历等办法纪念死者。干部职员和工人农民死亡者，可以根据情况以机关、工厂、车间或街道，农村以社或队为单位开追悼会。死者不做寿衣，可随身衣着，有什么穿什么。死者的后代、亲友不做孝服，可戴黑纱或白纱，也可以沿用在衣服上镶白边的办法。祭日应大大减少，可根据当地习惯，每年选择清明、春节等两三个祭日即可。祭礼，提倡鞠躬礼、默悼，逐渐改变叩头的习惯。
    在少数民族中，改革丧葬礼俗要慎重，有的地方可以缓予改革，由少数民族根据本民族的风俗习惯，自行改革。
    上述改革丧葬礼俗的办法，我们在莱阳县城郊和河洛乡作调查时，曾加以宣传，群众不仅接受而且十分欢迎（唯火葬多数农民暂时还难接受），他们说，改革丧葬礼俗有四大好处：一是扩大耕地，提高产量；二是不影响水利建设和拖拉机耕地；三是节约资财、投入生产建设；四是破除了封建迷信思想。
    为了慎重起见，上述各项方法在推行中均需要首先进行试点，取得经验，并经群众修改补充后加以推广。不论在试点中、或在推广中，必须做好思想工作，充分发动群众，贯彻自愿原则，允许任何一个人如果不愿接受新办法时，他仍可以按照他的旧办法办理。在试点或推广时，必须围绕着生产整风中心工作去进行。总之，改革旧的建立新的丧葬礼俗已成为广大群众的迫切要求。我们党应进一步加强领导和推动。我相信，在进行试点取得经验之后，再在汉族地区广泛推广，就可以使广大人民群众多、快、好、省地解除旧的丧葬礼俗所形成的精神上物质上的沉重负担，就会在思想上生产上出现新的局面。
