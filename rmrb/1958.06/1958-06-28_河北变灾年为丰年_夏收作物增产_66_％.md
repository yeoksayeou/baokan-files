Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 27th: The people of Hebei have used their strength to turn a disaster year into a bumper year, seizing 6.55 billion jin of summer grain from nature this year, an increase of 66% compared to the total output of summer crops last year. The average yield per mu of the more than 40 million mu of summer crops was 165.8 jin, an increase of 85% over last year. The total wheat production of 64 counties and cities in the province increased by more than 100% compared to last year, and more than 30 counties and cities increased by more than 50%. At the same time, seven counties and cities, including Anguo, Gaocheng, Zhengding, Shijiazhuang, and Xingtai, achieved yields of more than 400 jin per mu. There were 180,000 mu of high-yield fields yielding 1,000 jin, 2,000 jin, and 3,000-4,000 jin, and 66 "1,000-jin communes."

Hebei Province achieved this bumper harvest after overcoming more than 270 days without thorough rain. In the struggle against drought, although a very few people pessimistically estimated wheat production, the vast majority were determined and optimistic. They used the optimistic attitude of "look up at the starry sky, look down at ten thousand lights, planting wheat is like celebrating the New Year, every family rises before dawn" to fight the drought. With this heroic revolutionary spirit, most areas of wheat fields received five irrigations and four applications of fertilizer or seven irrigations and five applications of fertilizer, turning some seemingly hopeless wheat fields into high-yield wheat fields.

Collective wisdom and mutual support were important factors for the people of Hebei to overcome drought and fight for a bumper harvest. During the wheat harvest, the labor force mutually supported by various regions reached hundreds of thousands of people.

    河北变灾年为丰年
    夏收作物增产66％
    据新华社天津27日电　河北人民用回天之力把灾年变成丰年，今年向大自然夺得了六十五亿五千万斤夏粮，比去年夏收作物总产量增长66％。四千多万亩夏收作物的平均单位产量是一百六十五点八斤，比去年提高85％。全省有六十四个县市的小麦总产量比去年增产一倍以上，还有三十多个县市增产50％以上。同时，出现了安国、藁城、正定、石家庄和邢台市等七个亩产四百斤以上的县市，出现了十八万亩千斤、双千斤和三、四千斤的高额丰产田，六十六个千斤社。
    河北省是在战胜二百七十多天无透雨的情况下得到丰收的。在抗旱斗争中，尽管有极少数人对小麦的丰产作悲观的估计，但是绝大多数人斗志坚定，他们用“抬头看满天星，低头看万盏灯，种麦好比过新年，家家起五更”的乐观态度来抗旱。凭着这种气壮山河的革命气概，多数地区麦田得到了五水四肥或七水五肥，使有些看来无指望的麦田变成了丰产麦田。
    群策群力，互相支援，是河北人民战胜干旱、争夺丰收的重要因素。在麦收期间，各地互相支援的劳动力就达到了几十万人。
