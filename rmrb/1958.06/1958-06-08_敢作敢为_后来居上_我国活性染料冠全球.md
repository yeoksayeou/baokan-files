Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. In less than six months, China's variety of reactive dyes has surpassed the United Kingdom to rank first in the world, reaching the pinnacle of global dye science and technology.

According to the head of the Shanghai Dye Industry Laboratory, Shanghai's dye factories have now produced thirty-two kinds of reactive dyes, while the United Kingdom only has twenty-one. At the same time, the theoretical research, application issues, manufacturing methods, and quality levels of reactive dyes are on par with the United Kingdom.

Reactive dyes are the newest dyes in the world. These dyes can create a chemical reaction with textiles, so they never fade and can dye all fibers. Originally, only the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and West Germany could manufacture them, with the United Kingdom having the most varieties. However, the United Kingdom only officially granted domestic patent rights last year. At the beginning of January this year, Xi Xiangyun, a young technician at the Shanghai Runhua Dye Factory, with the cooperation and support of workers Jiang Boqi and Qian Wu Ba, successfully trial-produced China's first reactive dye, which inspired the people of the whole country. However, the lightfastness of the reactive dye's color was not as good as that of the United Kingdom, and the variety was monotonous, lacking dark-colored dyes. In order to further improve quality and increase variety, the Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission and the Municipal Chemical Industry Bureau invited technicians from dye factories and relevant scientific research institutions throughout the city to form a reactive dye research group. After Xi Xiangyun submitted the information he had already trial-produced to this research group, everyone analyzed and studied it to improve it, and mobilized all factories to continue trial-producing new varieties.

In this competition with the United Kingdom, Shanghai workers demonstrated a high degree of communist collaboration, carried out meticulous division of labor, exchanged experiences in a timely manner, and supported each other. The Institute of Organic Synthesis Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the East China Institute of Chemical Technology were responsible for dissecting and analyzing the structural components of reactive dyes; relevant textile research departments collected data; and various dye factories trial-produced new varieties. In less than a month, the lightfastness of reactive dyes caught up with the level of the United Kingdom. Afterwards, the East China Institute of Chemical Technology and Shanghai Dye Factory, among other units, successively trial-produced dark-colored reactive dyes. Up to now, six dye factories in Shanghai, including Runhua, Hongxing, and Taixin, have produced thirty-two varieties.

The problem of lightfastness of reactive dyes was solved, and the variety also increased, but a relatively important raw material for manufacturing reactive dyes had to be imported from abroad.

In order to fully catch up with the United Kingdom, dye factory workers demonstrated a daring communist style in the issue of self-made raw materials. They said: "If foreigners can do it, we can definitely do it too!" As a result of their hard work using simple equipment, they finally succeeded in manufacturing this raw material.

### 敢作敢为　后来居上  我国活性染料冠全球

    敢作敢为　后来居上
    我国活性染料冠全球
    新华社上海7日电　在不到半年的时间内，我国活性染料的品种已超过英国跃居世界第一位，登上了世界染料科学技术的高峰。
    据上海染料工业试验室负责人说：上海各染料厂目前已经制成了三十二种活性染料，而英国只有二十一种；同时，在活性染料的理论研究、应用问题、制造方法和质量水平上，都已经同英国不相上下。
    活性染料是世界上最新的染料。这种染料能与纺织品起一种化学作用，因此永不褪色，而且可以染一切纤维。原来，世界上只有英国、瑞士和西德能够制造，而以英国的品种较多；但是英国也是在去年才正式颁布国内专利权。今年1月初，上海润华染料厂青年技术员奚翔云，在工人蒋伯祺和钱伍捌的合作支持下，试制成功我国第一种活性染料后，振奋了全国人民，但是，活性染料颜色的日晒牢度不及英国，而且品种单调，没有深色的染料。为了进一步提高质量、增加品种，上海市计划委员会和市化学工业局邀集全市各染料厂及有关科学研究机关的技术人员，成立了活性染料研究组。奚翔云把他已经试制成功的资料提交这个研究组以后，便由大家分析研究提高，并且发动各厂继续试制新品种。
    在这场同英国较量的竞赛中，上海职工发挥了高度的共产主义的协作精神，进行了精细的分工，及时交流经验，相互支援。中国科学院有机合成化学研究所和华东化工学院，负责解剖分析活性染料的结构成份；有关的纺织研究部门收集资料；各染料厂试制新品种。经过不到一个月的时间，活性染料的日晒牢度，赶上了英国水平。之后，华东化工学院和上海染料厂等单位，又先后试制成功了深色活性染料。到目前为止，上海已有润华、宏兴、泰新等六个染料厂制成了三十二个品种。
    活性染料的日晒牢度问题解决了，品种也增加了，可是制造活性染料某种比较重要的原料，却要从国外进口。
    为了全面赶上英国，在自造原料问题上，染料厂的职工又表现了敢作敢为的共产主义风格。他们说：“外国能够做，我们也一定能够做！”他们运用简陋的设备苦干的结果，终于制造成功这种原料。（附图片）
