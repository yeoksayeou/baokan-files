    Substitutes for Ball Bearings

    A new key product that can replace ball bearings – iron-graphite oil-impregnated bearings – has recently been successfully trial-produced and put into production by the North China Radio Equipment Factory. This will open up a broad field for the production and supply of bearings in our country, and will play a huge role in solving the current difficulty of insufficient ball bearing supply during the Great Leap Forward in our country and in saving steel.

    The production process and technology of this oil-impregnated bearing are not very complicated. It simply involves grinding iron oxide scale, a waste product from steel rolling mills, into powder using a ball mill, mixing it with graphite powder, and then pressing, shaping, sintering, oil-impregnating, and grinding it.

    Because the raw material for this oil-impregnated bearing is waste from steel rolling, the cost is low, only 3 to 7 jiao per set, while a ball bearing of the same specification costs 3 to 4 yuan per set.

    This type of bearing can replace twenty-five different specifications of rolling bearings, bronze bearings, and tin-antimony-babbit bearings. It is currently being tested in motors, motorcycles, automobiles, bicycles, and other applications. This factory plans to produce 1.5 million sets this year to supply the whole country. (Li Baoyu)

    滚珠轴承的代用品
    一种可以代替滚珠轴承的重要新产品——铁石墨含油轴承最近华北无线电器材厂试制成功并开始生产。它将为我国轴承的生产和供应开辟了广阔的园地，对于解决目前我国大跃进时期滚珠轴承供应不足的困难和节约钢材方面将起到巨大的作用。
    这种含油轴承的生产过程和技术并不十分复杂，只是把轧钢厂轧钢时产生的废物——氧化铁皮用球磨机磨成粉末，再和石墨粉混合一起，再经过压制、成型、烧结、浸油、研磨等工序就做成了。
    这种含油轴承由于原料是轧钢废料，成本低廉，每套只需三角至七角，而同样规格的滚珠轴承，每套要三元至四元。
    这种轴承可以代替二十五种不同规格的滚动轴承，青铜轴承及锡锑巴特轴承，现在已在电机、摩托车、汽车、自行车等方面试用，这个厂今年计划生产一百五十万套供应全国应用。（李宝玉）
