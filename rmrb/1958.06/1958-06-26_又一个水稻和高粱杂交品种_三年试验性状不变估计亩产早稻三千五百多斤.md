    Another Hybrid Rice and Sorghum Variety
    Unchanged Characteristics in Three Years of Testing, Estimated Yield of Over 3,500 Jin of Early Rice Per Mu
    Jiang Shaofang, a worker at the Yulin County Normal School in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, conducted sexual hybridization between the dwarf sticky rice and sorghum in 1955, that is, spreading the pollen of sorghum male flowers to the pollen of dwarf sticky rice, and cultivated the first generation of hybrid seeds. In 1956, he used the cultivated first-generation hybrid to cross with Baotai sticky rice, and cultivated the second-generation improved variety. In the late season of 1956, the seeds were trial-planted, and the growth was very good. The rice plants were tall and strong, the leaves were thick and long, the rice stalks were hard and glossy, the tillering was moderate, and each ear produced 600 grains. Continued cultivation in 1957 showed no change in characteristics. This spring, Comrade Jiang Shaofang planted three jin of the cultivated seeds on 0.45 mu of land on the campus. The seeds were soaked on February 23, sown on February 25 (dry sowing), sprouted on March 14, and transplanted (pulled seedlings) on April 2. No seedling root fertilizer was applied. The transplanting specification was 6 × 6, with three seedlings per clump. The rice clumps tillered from the original three seedlings to fourteen seedlings. The rice stalks were hard, strong, tall, and large. The tallest rice was five and a half feet tall, and the average was four and a half to four feet eight inches tall, more than a foot taller than ordinary rice; the rice stems were as thick as water pens, with a diameter of 1.3 centimeters. Its inherited characteristics of sorghum are: tall stalks, abundant grains, and uniform heading, but without lodging. It has now entered the grouting and grain-filling stage. The rice ears are as long as one foot two inches, and the grains are full. The most productive ear has 526 grains, and the average has three to four hundred grains. According to preliminary estimates, there are about 8,000 rice clumps on this 0.45 mu of land. Assuming each clump has fourteen seedlings and each ear has a minimum of 300 grains, this plot can harvest more than 1,600 jin of rice. Based on this conversion, the yield per mu can reach more than 3,500 jin. However, judging from the current situation, the actual yield may exceed this figure.
    According to research, if this plot had not suffered from a slight drought this year, and if it had been in a normal year with favorable weather, coupled with deep plowing, careful cultivation, and sufficient fertilizer application, the yield could have been greatly increased.
    Comrade Jiang Shaofang is a young man from a poor peasant family. He is only in his twenties this year. In addition to doing his job well at school, he also participated in the school's Michurin research group and actively studied and experimented. When the Party proposed developing agricultural production, it deeply moved him. He thought that the current rice yield was very low and that he should find a way to increase it. Therefore, he thought of sorghum, which is thick and produces many grains. If rice could be successfully hybridized with sorghum, it would greatly increase yield. So, starting in 1955, he began to use sorghum and dwarf sticky rice for sexual hybridization to cultivate improved varieties. After more than three years of hard work and dozens of experiments, he finally succeeded.

### 又一个水稻和高粱杂交品种  三年试验性状不变估计亩产早稻三千五百多斤

    又一个水稻和高粱杂交品种
    三年试验性状不变估计亩产早稻三千五百多斤
    广西僮族自治区玉林县师范学校工人蒋少芳在1955年用水稻矮子粘和高粱进行有性杂交，即把高粱的雄花粉传播到矮子粘的花粉上，培育出第一代杂交种子。1956年又以培养出来的第一代杂交和水稻宝太粘进行杂交，培育出第二代良种。1956年晚造以这种子试种，生长很好，禾株高大粗壮，叶身粗长，稻秆坚硬带有光泽，分蘖中等，每穗结谷六百粒。1957年继续培育，性状不变。今年春蒋少芳同志即把培育出来的三斤种籽种植在校园的零点四五亩土地上，2月23日浸种，25日播种（旱播），3月14日发芽，4月2日移植（扯秧），没下秧根肥，插秧规格是6×6，每蔸三苗。禾蔸由原来插三苗分蘖到十四苗，禾秆坚硬粗壮高大，最高稻有五尺半高，一般的都有四尺半到四尺八寸高，比一般的水稻高一尺多；稻茎如水笔样粗大，直径一点三公分。其承继高粱的特性是：禾高、实多，抽穗整齐，但不倒伏。现在已灌浆结实，谷穗长达一尺二寸，谷粒饱满，最多的一穗结谷五百二十六粒，一般的都有三四百粒。据初步鉴定，在这块零点四五亩田中有八千蔸禾左右，以每蔸十四苗，每穗最低结谷三百粒计算，这块地可收谷一千六百多斤，按此折算，每亩产量可达三千五百多斤。但从当前情况看，实产可能要超过这个数字。
    据研究，这块田假如不是今年略微受旱，如果是在风调雨顺的正常年景下，加上深耕细作，施足肥料，产量将能大大地提高。
    蒋少芳同志是一个贫农出身的青年，今年才二十多岁，他在学校除了搞好自己的工作外，还参加了学校米丘林研究小组，积极钻研试验。当党提出发展农业生产的时候，深深地打动了他。他想，现在水稻产量很低，应该想办法提高，于是他想起了高粱粗大结粒多，如果水稻能同高粱杂交成功，一定能大大提高产量。于是他从1955年就开始用高粱和水稻矮子粘进行有性杂交培育良种。经过三年多的苦钻，数十次的试验，终于得到了成功。
