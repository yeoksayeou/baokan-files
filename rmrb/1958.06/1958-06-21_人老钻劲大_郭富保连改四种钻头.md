    The older one gets, the more energetic one becomes in research
    Guo Fubao consecutively modifies four types of drill bits
    Inspired by the general line of socialist construction, Guo Fubao, a sixty-year-old drilling worker at the Wuchang Vehicle Factory, showed great enthusiasm and consecutively improved four types of drill bits, increasing work efficiency by twenty-four times. Drilling the drainage holes for the ㄅ11 car floor mat, he used to make only four a day, but after improving the drill bit, he increased it to seventy. If the wood is not very hard, he can make one hundred.
