Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 18th: The Hubei Province Lower-Level Cadre Representative Conference pointed out that lower-level cadres must, on the basis of the achievements already made in labor training, muster up their energy and continue to actively participate in labor production, as well as grassroots work and mass work, to fully train and transform themselves.

The conference was held in Wuhan from the 14th to the 17th, with more than 600 representatives attending. Their speeches at the meeting showed that in the past five months, the more than 50,000 cadres at all levels of Party and government organs in Hubei Province and relevant central departments who had been sent to the rural areas of Hubei Province for labor training had mostly withstood the test of labor, learned some production knowledge, and experienced the greatness of labor and the preciousness of labor's fruits, ending their past state of being "unable to distinguish the five grains and disinclined to use their limbs." In eating, living, and working with the farmers, they have established relatively deep feelings for each other, helping and caring for each other. Cadres teach farmers to learn culture, farmers teach cadres to learn production, and the relationship between cadres and the masses is completely equal. All of this has not only gained the trust of the masses for the lower-level cadres but also laid a good foundation for them to develop in the direction of becoming both red and expert.

The meeting pointed out that a sense of complacency is currently growing among some lower-level cadres. For example, some lower-level cadres overestimate the achievements they have made, thinking that they are "almost done with their training." This sentiment comes from two aspects: one is that labor training is one-sidedly understood as simply carrying out labor, the so-called "ignoring everything under the heavens and concentrating on labor"; the other is that they came down purely to obtain farmer qualifications, the so-called "reddening" or "gilding" their resumes. Through discussions in large and small meetings, the representatives clarified that the so-called "all-round training" is a thought reform movement based on labor training. Experience has proven that simple labor will not achieve the expected results of thought reform, or at least will weaken this effect. To achieve the goal of thoroughly transforming thought, it is necessary to actively participate in grassroots work and mass work while actively participating in labor production. Only through training in these two aspects can we better transform our bourgeois individualist thoughts, such as underestimating labor, underestimating the masses, and transcending class viewpoints, and establish the proletariat's class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and labor concept. Only then can we learn the Party's fundamental working methods of the mass line and the basic knowledge of agricultural production.

In order to strengthen the transformation of lower-level cadres, the meeting decided that in the future, regular or irregular, individual or collective methods will be used to rectify thinking and improve understanding. After a period of labor training, lower-level cadres should take necessary rest periods to allow them to systematically examine, summarize, and evaluate their thoughts and actions in the previous stage, in order to clarify the direction of their efforts in the next stage. Repeating this cycle will not only promote the lower-level cadres' consciousness of thought reform but also make the thought reform movement form a continuous upward trend from low to high, with each wave pushing the next.

Based on the experience of the previous stage, the meeting believes that lower-level cadres should achieve "six goods." These are: good in labor production, good in participating in grassroots work and technological and cultural revolutions, good in thought reform, good in learning, good in obeying leadership and observing discipline, and good in contacting the masses. The meeting proposed a competition initiative to all lower-level cadres in the province based on these conditions.

During the meeting, Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and Wang Yuzhen, Minister of the Organization Department, delivered reports on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and on the work of lower-level cadres, respectively. Ministers of the Organization Departments of relevant prefectural and county Party committees also attended the meeting.

    克服自满情绪　加强全面锻炼
    湖北下放干部开展“六好”运动
    新华社武汉18日电　湖北省下放干部代表会议指出，下放干部必须在劳动锻炼已经取得成绩的基础上，鼓足干劲，继续积极地参加劳动生产以及基层工作和群众工作，全面地锻炼和改造自己。
    这次会议14日到17日在武汉召开，参加的代表有六百多人。他们在会上的发言表明，五个月来，下放到湖北省农村劳动锻炼的湖北省各级党政机关和中央有关部门的五万多名干部，绝大部分经受住了劳动的考验，学会了一些生产知识，并且体验到劳动的伟大和劳动果实的珍贵，结束了过去那种“五谷不分，四体不勤”的状态。在和农民同吃同住同劳动中，彼此间建立起比较深厚的感情，互相帮助，互相体贴，干部教农民学文化，农民教干部学生产，干部和群众的关系完全处在平等的地位。所有这些，不仅使下放干部取得了群众的信任，而且给他们向红透专深的方向发展打下了良好的基础。
    会议指出，目前部分下放干部中正滋长着一种自满情绪，例如有些下放干部对已取得的成就估计过高，认为“锻炼得差不多”了。这种情绪来自两个方面，一种是把劳动锻炼片面地理解为简单地进行劳动，即所谓“两耳不闻天下事，一心一意搞劳动”；另一种是单纯为了取得农民资格下来的，这就是所谓“抹红”或“镀金”的思想。通过大小会议的讨论，代表们明确了所谓“全面锻炼”，就是以劳动锻炼为主的思想改造运动。经验证明，单纯的劳动不会收到思想改造的预期效果，至少会减弱这种效果。为达到彻底改造思想的目的，必须在积极参加劳动生产的同时积极参加基层工作和群众工作，在这两方面的锻炼中，才能更好地改造自己的轻视劳动、轻视群众以及超阶级观点等资产阶级个人主义思想，建立起无产阶级的阶级观点、群众观点和劳动观念，也才能学会党的群众路线的根本工作方法和农业生产的基本知识。
    为了加强对下放干部的改造，会议决定今后用定期或不定期、个人或集体相结合的方法来整顿思想，提高认识。下放干部劳动锻炼一个时期以后应进行必要的休整，让下放干部把前一阶段的思想和言行系统地加以检查、总结，进行评比，以明确下一步的努力方向。如此循环下去，不仅能促进下放干部思想改造的自觉性，而且将使思想改造运动形成前浪推后浪、由低级到高级不间断的上升趋势。
    会议根据前一阶段的经验，认为下放干部应作到“六好”。就是：劳动生产好、参加基层工作和技术革命文化革命好、思想改造好、学习好、服从领导和遵守纪律好、联系群众好。会议以这些条件向全省下放干部提出了评比倡议书。
    会议期间，中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、组织部部长王玉珍分别作了党的八大二次会议精神的传达报告和下放干部工作报告。有关地委、县委的组织部部长也参加了这次会议。
