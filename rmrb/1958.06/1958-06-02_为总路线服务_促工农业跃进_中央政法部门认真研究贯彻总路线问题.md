Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: The central political and legal departments have conscientiously conveyed and discussed the issue of how to implement the general line for socialist construction. Some departments have already put forward preliminary plans and requirements for implementing the general line. The First Office of the State Council convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Supervision on May 28, requesting each department to better serve the general line of socialist construction.

The Ministry of Public Security plans to combine the Party Congress held within the ministry to vigorously and thoroughly publicize and study the general line, and decided to convene a national public security work conference in June to discuss the issue of implementing the general line. The Party group of the Ministry of Public Security pointed out that public security work should play its due and greater role in implementing the general line, relentlessly打击 (dǎjí -strike, crack down on) the enemy, resolutely protect production, and strive to create a more stable and unprecedentedly good social order to ensure the smooth realization of the general line of socialist construction. The Party group of the Ministry of Supervision is holding an enlarged meeting to study and discuss the general line, further examine and summarize the experience and lessons of supervision work over the past few years, emphasizing the need to first liberate thinking in order to remove the ideological obstacles to implementing the general line. The Party group of the Ministry of Supervision also proposed that in implementing the general line, it is necessary to better exert the role of national supervision work by improving the quality and efficiency of investigating and handling cases, promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and ensure the smooth implementation of the general line of socialist construction.

The Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Justice have all earnestly discussed the issue of studying the general line, and have begun to conduct studies among leading cadres. After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the Ministry of Internal Affairs convened the Fourth National Civil Affairs Work Conference to discuss how civil affairs work can serve production and how to implement the general line in civil affairs work.
