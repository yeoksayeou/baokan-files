People's Daily, Mangai, June 22nd (Reporter Li Zhi'an) The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau is reforming its employee training system. This year, it began to implement the method of "everyone learns to be versatile, and machines should do multiple jobs," cultivating each employee to have "specializing in one skill, mastering three skills, and understanding five skills" of multiple operating techniques.

Since the Great Leap Forward this year, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau has experienced some labor shortages. Next year's production tasks will be even greater than this year, and the labor shortage will be even more acute. In the past, many jobs here were divided too finely. Even within the same group or drilling team, there were many different specialties, with one person only knowing one thing. This required more people to meet production needs. At the same time, there are no mass residents in Qaidam, exploration areas are scattered, and transportation lines are long. The labor shortage is even more prominent, leading to the phenomenon of work waiting for people and people waiting for work, which affects production.

In response to these situations, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau changed its past single-skill training method and vigorously promoted on-site training and learning multiple skills. For example, drilling workers should learn to repair, install, and manage sand sampling, welders should learn gas welding, and manage internal combustion engine operation and other technologies. After making these requirements, some units have seen new changes. For example, workers with low skills and ordinary workers have quickly grown into nine new drilling teams composed of more than 300 people through on-site training, undertaking new tasks. The central laboratory has 20% of its technicians and skilled workers have learned three or more operating techniques. The instrument repair group of the electromechanical general factory originally had eight technicians who could only repair five types of instruments such as levels and theodolites. But after learning multiple skills, three people can now repair 35 types of instruments and precision tools such as well-logging instruments and electric computers.

Adopting the new method of training employees of "everyone learns to be versatile, and machines should do multiple jobs" has many benefits. First, it can fully tap the potential of employees and promote the development of production. Drilling workers learning the technology of installation and mud preparation will prevent delays caused by relocation and installation after the completion of a well. Diesel engine workers learning repair and welding technology can repair machines in a timely manner and maintain the normal operation of diesel engines. Second, learning multiple skills allows people to master machines instead of machines restricting people. This allows people to exert their multiple talents at any time according to production needs, and there will be no more difficulties in supplementing personnel due to a shortage of one type of work. At the same time, machines can also play a greater role. Third, after employees master three skills and understand five skills, they will further enrich their professional and technical knowledge, enabling them to further improve their professional and technical skills. Fourth, it can reduce staffing and solve the problem of labor shortages.

In the process of promoting the activity of learning multiple skills, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau also actively formulated methods for training multiple skills. They mainly focus on on-site training, signing master-apprentice contracts, mutual assistance learning contracts, and establishing spare-time technical study classes and cultural classes in various exploration bureaus, setting off a high tide of learning technology and culture, so that more than 2,000 employees trained this year and next year and existing employees can become people with multiple technical skills.

### 人人做到“专一门  会三门  懂五门”  青海石油勘探局革新培训职工制度

    人人做到“专一门  会三门  懂五门”
    青海石油勘探局革新培训职工制度
    本报茫崖22日电  记者李治安报道：青海石油勘探局革新培训职工制度，今年开始推行“人人学会多面手、机器要做多种活”的办法，培养每个职工能“专一门、会三门、懂五门”的多种操作技术。
    青海石油勘探局在今年大跃进以来，劳动力有些紧张，明年的生产任务比今年更大，劳动力会更加缺乏，加以过去这里的很多工作都是分工分业过细，虽同在一个组一个井队也有很多不同的专业，一人只会一样，这样就需要更多的人才能满足生产需要。同时柴达木没有群众居民，探区分散，交通线长，劳动力的紧张就更为突出，以致发生工作等人，人等工作的现象，影响了生产。
    青海石油勘探局针对这些情况，改变了过去单打一的培训办法，大力提倡现场培训和学会多面手。如钻井工要学会修理，安装兼管取捞砂样，电焊工学会气焊，并管内燃机运转等多种技术。提出这样的要求后，有的单位已出现了新的变化。如原来技术低的和普通工，经过现场培训已迅速成长起一支三百多人组成的九个新井队，担负了新的任务。中心试验室已有20％的技术员和技工学会三种以上的操作技术。机电总厂仪器修理组原来八个技术员只能修水平仪、经纬仪等五种仪器，但学会多面手后，目前三个人已能修测井仪、电动计算机等三十五种仪器和精密工具了。
    采用“人人学会多面手，机器要做多种活”的培训职工的新办法的好处很多。首先是能充分发挥职工的潜力，促进生产的发展。钻井工人学会安装和配泥浆的技术，就不会在一口井完钻后因搬家安装而带来的窝工。柴油机工人学会修理和电焊技术，就可及时修理机器，经常保持柴油机正常运转。其次是学会多面手后，使人掌握了机器而不是机器限制了人。这样可以根据生产的需要随时发挥人的多种才能，不再因一个工种缺人而发生补充的困难，同时机器也可以发挥更大的作用。第三，职工们做到会三门、懂五门后将会更丰富他的专业技术知识，使他的专业技术能进一步提高。第四，可以减少人员的编制，解决劳动力不足的困难。
    青海石油勘探局在推行学会多面手的活动中，还积极制订培训多面手的办法。他们以现场培训为主，签订师徒合同、互助学习合同，各探局成立业余技术学习班与文化班的方式，掀起一个学技术学文化的高潮。使今年明年培训的两千多名职工和现有的在职职工成为有多种技术才能的人。
