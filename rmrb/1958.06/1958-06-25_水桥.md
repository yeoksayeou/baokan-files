    Aqueduct
    Zhang Ranghua
    On a five-li-long canal, people had been fighting for days. The clanging of old hammers and steel picks striking the stone slab still echoed through the valley. Although people were swinging their picks like the wind, sweating like rain, they couldn't help but look back at the stone slab from time to time, their eyes asking, "Can we really get up there?"
    Seeing this, Ma, the head of Guantun Agricultural Cooperative, put down his pickaxe and raised his arm: "Come on, a few people come to the dam to release water and guide it." More than twenty young people swarmed over. Once the water was released from the dam, it slowly climbed along the new canal. Wherever the water couldn't climb, people dug. Digging, shoveling, the long line moved forward quickly, and the water finally climbed onto the stone slab, rushing forward.
    As evening approached and it was time to stop working, people went back to eat, but Director Ma squatted on the stone slab, staring at the flowing water, lost in thought. He had tasted the bitterness of drought in this mountainous area for more than twenty years. A drop of water is worth a grain of rice; water is precious!
    Now, the sound of the water flowing in the canal was as pleasant as the sound of grain entering the granary! He looked at the opposite mountain, where newly built terraced fields looked like crouching dragons blocking the mountainside; a narrow valley at the foot of the mountain lay quietly in the evening mist; the waterwheel recently installed on the Touhe well looked black from a distance, like a person squatting on the eastern side of the terrace. Speaking of the Touhe well, he and old man Zhang suffered a lot last winter. In order to draw river water to the shore and turn dry land into irrigated fields, they chiseled open the stone wall with pickaxes and hammers, cracking their tiger's mouths. Finally, they dug a well more than two zhang deep. At that time, although people were exhausted, they were very comforted: "The cooperative has more than twenty mu of irrigated land, something that has never existed for generations. What does it matter to suffer a little!" This spring, they also chiseled stones and stacked them into piers under the cliffs of Xiping, erecting a scale-pole aqueduct several zhang high. The more than six mu of land that has been irrigated are the cooperative's thousand-jin mu of land this year, and the barley sown a few days ago has broken ground and sprouted.
    The village has never had a single fen of paddy field. Now the cooperative has built more than thirty mu of paddy fields. It seems that their progress is not slow. However, once the canal under construction is completed, the Songjiagou and Hanjiagou cooperatives can irrigate more than two hundred mu of valley land, and they will run ahead, far ahead of them.
    He stared at the wide river bank for a long time. Suddenly, an idea flashed through his mind: send the water from the stone slab to the other side of the river. The stone slab is high, and as long as the water crosses over, all the valley land on the other side can be irrigated completely by gravity. What worried him was the wide river bank in front of him. Water has no wings and cannot fly across. It is ten or twenty zhang wide from this bank to that bank, and the riverbed is one or two zhang higher than the stone slab. Build a stone bridge? The cooperative is small and the foundation is weak, and cannot afford to build one. Even if they could afford to build one, a flood would wipe it out.
    Back home, after eating dinner, he lay down, tossing and turning, unable to sleep, recalling the size of the floods and the terrain of the water flow each year. The flood was the biggest one year, but the water did not reach the stone slab; the water in the small river flowed along a large bay in a mountain cliff to the foot of the stone slab cliff. Ordinary floods also reached the high shoals in the riverbed. Thinking, thinking, he finally found a way: build a stone pier several zhang long on the high shoal, wouldn't the river bank be narrowed by several zhang? There are plenty of scattered stones in the river beach, no need to buy them, no need to hire stonemasons, the cooperative members can carry them themselves, stack them themselves. There are plenty of hollow willow trees in the mountains, cut down a few, dig wooden troughs to connect them, this bank is supported on the stone slab, that bank is supported on the stone pier, it must work. There is a thick gacha tree more than two zhang high in Nangou, it is a good support post, one post can support a thousand jin of beams, planting it in the center of the riverbed can support even more weight...
    He had just fallen asleep groggily when the window paper was already bright. The whistle to start work on the canal sounded, and he climbed up, carried his iron pickaxe, and ran to the canal.
    Early in the morning, old Liu, the water conservancy surveyor, had run all over the canal. When he and Director Ma met, Director Ma told him the plan he had thought about last night and asked him what he thought. Old Liu was very happy when he heard it: "This is a clever move, it can be done, let's try it!" Director Ma asked old Liu to take some time to go to the other side of the river and use a level to see if the water could irrigate all of that valley land. Old Liu readily agreed: "This is not difficult, it can be done."
    When the first phase of this canal was about to be completed, the canal on the opposite bank had already been surveyed. As soon as this side was completed, the members of Guantun Cooperative immediately started to act: carrying stones, stacking piers, pushing soil, ramming; Director Ma and old man Zhang were still old partners, going to the mountains together to cut trees and dig wooden troughs… In a few days, a new scene had appeared here: a water trough six or seven zhang long stood majestically across the two banks of the river. People passing by could not help but stop, watching and praising: "This year's Great Leap Forward is really a hero, a good man, everyone is better than Zhuge Liang. If the Dragon King has a spirit, let him look at this aqueduct, he will be angry enough to have a stomachache!"

    水桥
    张让花
    在一条五里来长的水渠上，人们已经战斗了几天，老锤和钢镐凿敲石盘的叮当声，仍在川里震天价响。人们虽然挥镐如飞，汗流如雨地在干，但又不时回头望望石盘，那眼光是在发问：“真能爬上去吗？”
    贯屯农社的马社长把这些看在眼里，他放下十字镐，把胳膊一扬：“走，来几个人到坝上去，放水引水修。”二十几个青年人蜂涌着去了。坝上的水一放脱，就顺着新渠道缓慢地爬着。水在哪里爬不上去，人们就在哪里挖起来。挖着、铲着，一字长蛇阵向前迅速移动着，水终于爬上了石盘，哗哗向前奔去。
    傍晚收工时分，人们都回去吃饭了，马社长却蹲在石盘上盯着流水出神。这山区，三年两头干旱的苦头他尝过二十多年了。一滴水一颗粮，水就是宝啊！
    现在水渠里流水的哗哗声，就像粮食入仓时的响声那么动听！他望望对面的山，山上新修的层层梯田像卧龙拦住山腰；山脚下一条狭长的川地在暮霭中静静躺着；前些天刚安装在透河井上的水车，远远望去，黑乎乎的像个人蹲在东边的坪畔上。说起透河井，去年冬天，他和张老汉可吃了不少苦头。为了引河水上岸，变旱地为水浇田，他们一镐一锤凿开了石壁，虎口都震裂了，最后终于开出了一口二丈多深的井。那时候，人虽然熬得撑不定，但心里却很自慰：“社里有了二十多亩水浇田，这是世世代代没有的，熬一点算什么！”今年春天，他们又在西坪的崖下，凿石垒码子，架起了一座好几丈高的秤杆水，已浇水的六亩多地，是社里今年的千斤亩地，前几天播种的大麦已破土出苗了。
    村里从来没有一分水田。现在社里修了三十来亩水田，按说他们前进的脚步不算慢了。但是，正在修的水渠一修好，宋家沟和韩家沟社能灌川地二百多亩，人家就跑到前面去了，他们被远远闪在后面。
    他久久地凝视着宽宽的河岸。忽然一个念头闪动：把水从石盘上送到对岸去。石盘高，只要水过去，对岸的一片川地可以用自流水全部浇完。使他发愁的是眼前宽宽的河岸。水没有翅膀，飞不过去。这岸到那岸十来丈宽，河床距石盘一两丈高，修石桥吗？社小家底薄，修不起。即使修得起，一场洪水下来会推个精光。
    回到家里，吃过饭躺下来，他翻来复去不能入睡，回忆着每年洪水的大小和水流的地势。有一年洪水最大，水也没有上石盘；小河里的水是顺着一个山崖的大湾冲到石盘崖下流走的，一般的洪水还上了河床里的高滩地。想着想着，终于找出了门路：高滩地上垒一座几丈长的石码子，河岸不是缩窄了几丈吗？河滩里有的是乱石头，不用买，不用请石匠，社员们自己背，自己垒。山里空心柳树有的是，砍到几棵，挖木槽接起来，这岸担在石盘上，那岸担在石码上，一定能行。南沟有一棵两丈多高的粗圪杈树，是根好顶柱，一柱能顶千斤梁，栽在河心槽子再重也能撑得住……。
    他迷迷糊糊刚入睡，窗纸已经透亮了，上工修水渠的哨子响了，他爬起来扛起铁镐就往渠道上跑。
    一清早，水利测量员老刘已跑遍了整个渠道，当他和马社长碰头时，马社长把昨夜想的计划告诉了他，问他怎么样，老刘一听，很是高兴：“这一招高，能成，试试看！”马社长请老刘抽空到河对面去，用水平仪照一照，看水能否放完那一片川地。老刘满口承应：“这不费难，办得到。”
    当这条水渠的第一期工程快结束的时候，河对岸的水渠道已经测量好了。这边刚完工，贯屯社的社员们就马上动作起来：背石头、垒码子、推土、打夯；马社长和张老汉仍是老搭当，一起到山里砍树挖木槽，……不几天工夫，这里已出现了新的景象：长达六、七丈的水槽子雄伟地横跨在河的两岸上。过路的人们，走到这里，都不禁停住脚步，一边观看，一边赞不绝口：“今年这大跃进，真是你英雄，我好汉，人人都赛诸葛亮。龙王爷要有灵，看看这水桥，他不气得肚疼才怪呢！”
