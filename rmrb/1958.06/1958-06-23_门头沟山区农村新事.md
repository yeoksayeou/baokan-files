New Things in the Rural Mountainous Areas of Mentougou
Beijing University Downward Transferred Cadre Li Yining

    Using spare parts to assemble our own water pumps,
    Leading the river water up the mountain slopes,
    We call it a "water pump,"
    The farmers call it "Little Dragon King."

    Bacterial fertilizer, bacteria culture in four or five days,
    Mixed with black soil and applied to the fields,
    Low cost and small dosage,
    It only costs one dime per mu.

    Windmill, the windmill is truly wonderful,
    Saving expenses and labor,
    Driving the millstone day and night,
    Regardless of whether the wind is from the east, south, west or north.

    Artificial cotton factory
    The factory equipment is incomplete,
    The products are quite peculiar,
    What is the raw material for artificial cotton?
    Lamp posts and linden bark.

    Fruit processing factory
    What to do with too many mountain fruits?
    They will rot if they cannot be transported out,
    It's a good idea to set up a factory,
    Go ahead and work hard.

    Gaopu Hydropower Station
    Having gone through untold hardships,
    Electric lights illuminate Gaopu,
    The canals are like dragons,
    The power station is a shining pearl.

    Red and Expert University
    Overthrowing superstitious thoughts,
    Science is blooming everywhere,
    Running a Red and Expert University,
    To train worker-peasant experts.

    Nursery
    The nursery is really great,
    Peking University cadres as nannies,
    The children grow up fair and chubby,
    Strong as a little weight.

    Veterinarian
    Bottles of medicine,
    Specially treating pig and sheep diseases,
    Farmers praise the cadres:
    -- You're great!

    门头沟山区农村新事
    北京大学下放干部  厉以宁
    抽水机利用零件自己装，引得河水上山岗，咱们唤它“抽水机”，农民称它“小龙王”。
    细菌肥料菌种培养四五天，拌入黑土施下田，成本低廉用量少，每亩只花一毛钱。
    风  车风车好处真无穷，又省经费又省工，日夜带动磨盘转，管它东南西北风。人造棉工厂工厂设备不齐，产品倒也希奇，人造棉花啥原料？点灯棍、椴树皮。果品加工厂山果太多怎么办？运不出去就会烂，办个工厂倒不错，鼓足劲儿动手干。高铺水电站历尽千辛万苦，电灯照亮高铺，水渠好比蛟龙，电站是颗明珠。
    红专大学迷信思想打垮，科学遍地开花，办个红专大学，培养工农专家。
    托儿所托儿所，真不错，北大干部当保姆，孩子长的白又胖，壮得像个小秤砣。
    兽  医药物一瓶瓶，专治猪羊病，农民夸干部：——行！
