One Link After Another, Never Relaxing Any Link
Lishui Launches Early Rice Four-Guarantee Campaign

(Our dispatch) Zhejiang's Lishui County is vigorously promoting the "Four-Guarantee" movement for early rice—guaranteeing seedlings, guaranteeing ears, guaranteeing grains, and guaranteeing yield—to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice.

In mid-May, when the last batch of early rice had just been transplanted, the Lishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a "Four-Guarantee" movement throughout the county, focusing on strengthening field management, including more weeding, timely topdressing, rational irrigation and drainage, and early pest control.

After the early rice was transplanted in Lishui County, it encountered prolonged cloudy and rainy weather. Some cadres and the masses developed a slackened mood and were not very concerned about how to try every possible means to complete the production increase plan. Especially among some old farmers, the old idea of "abundance or scarcity is unpredictable, good or bad is determined by heaven" was still quite strong. They expressed great doubt that human effort could determine future yields. The Lishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first grasped the link of launching a county-wide field competition, evaluating the quality of rice seedlings, comparing the level of field management, summarizing and promoting advanced experience, and affirming that backward seedlings that were slow to turn green could be transformed. "As long as you put in the effort, rotten seedlings can grow into a thousand catties!" Within three days, a movement to rescue and transform 20,000 mu of backward seedlings was launched throughout the county. The main methods of rescue and transformation were early weeding, more weeding, and early topdressing.

After the rice seedlings turned green, the county committee led the county's farmers to check the tillering situation every day, counting the number of tillering plants. At this time, the tens of thousands of mu of experimental fields of early sowing, early transplanting, early weeding, and more weeding by cadres played a huge role. The cadres used examples of early and more weeding to promote vigorous tillering of rice seedlings to persuade farmers throughout the county to weed their fields earlier. In the past, Lishui County had always been popular with large-clump sparse planting. The first weeding was done more than twenty days after transplanting, and the second weeding was done more than twenty days later. During these two twenty-day periods, weeds competed with rice seedlings for growth, consuming a lot of soil fertility, resulting in low yields. The county committee advocated more weeding and more harrowing, requiring the first weeding to be done ten days after transplanting, the second weeding seven or eight days later, and then two to three more weedings every seven or eight days. Moreover, it was required that topdressing should be applied every time or every other time of weeding, so that the rice seedlings could fully tiller and reach the expected number of tillering plants.

Since proposing the battle cry of guaranteeing seedlings, guaranteeing ears, guaranteeing grains, and guaranteeing yield, Lishui County has, for more than a month, greatly promoted field management work by constantly counting plants, calculating panicles, counting grains, and estimating yields in the fields. Weeding, pest control, topdressing, rational irrigation and drainage, and other agricultural activities are closely linked one after another, and no link is relaxed. At present, a good foundation for a bumper harvest of early rice has been achieved. According to the latest statistics from the county, most of the first and second categories of rice fields, which account for 80% of the county's total early rice area, have reached the planned requirements in terms of the number of tillering plants and the number of grains per ear. The remaining 20% of the third category of rice fields are currently strengthening field management.

The Lishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that as long as field management is closely linked to every link, there will be no third-category fields in the county, and it is entirely possible to achieve the planned yield targets. (You Qi)

### 一环扣一环　环环不放松  丽水开展早稻四保运动

    一环扣一环　环环不放松
    丽水开展早稻四保运动
    本报讯　浙江丽水县为争取早稻丰收，正大搞早稻保株、保穗、保粒、保产运动。
    5月中旬，当最迟的一批早稻刚插完，中共丽水县委就在全县范围内展开了以早耘多耘、适时追肥、合理排灌、早治虫害等加强田间管理为中心内容的保株、保穗、保粒、保产的“四保”运动。
    丽水县在早稻插下以后，遇到了长久阴雨不晴的坏天气。一部分干部和群众曾产生了松劲情绪，对如何千方百计地去争取完成增产计划表示不大关心；特别在一部分老农民中，还相当浓厚的存在着“丰歉难预知，好坏天决定”的旧思想，他们对于人力可以决定将来的产量这一点表示很大的怀疑。中共丽水县委首先抓住了发动全县农民田间大评比这一环节，评稻苗好坏，比田间管理的高低，总结推广先进经验，肯定落后的迟不转青的稻苗都可改造。“只要工夫深，烂秧长千斤！”三天之内，在全县范围内发起了抢救、改造两万亩落后苗的运动。抢救、改造的办法主要是早耘、多耘和及早追肥。
    稻苗转青以后，县委又领导全县农民天天检查发棵分蘖情况，查点发棵分蘖的株数。在这时，全县干部早播、早插、早耘、多耘的上万亩试验田起了巨大的作用。干部们运用早耘、多耘促使稻秧旺盛发棵的事例来说服全县农民提早耘田。在过去，丽水县一向盛行大墩疏植，插秧后二十多天才耘头遍，再过二十多天再耘二遍，在这两次二十多天中，杂草与稻苗争长，消耗了不少地力，因而产量不高。县委提倡多耘多耥，要求插下后十天就耘头遍，再过七、八天就耘二遍，以后每隔七、八天再耘两遍到三遍，而且要求每次或隔一次耘田时要施追肥，这样一定可以使稻苗充分发棵，达到应有的分蘖株数。
    丽水县在提出保株、保穗、保粒、保产的战斗口号以后，一个多月来，他们用不断的在田间数株数、算穗头、点谷粒，估产量的办法大大地推动了田间管理工作，使耘田，除虫、追肥、合理排灌等农事活动一环紧扣一环，环环都不放松，到目前已取得了良好的早稻大丰产的基础。据全县最近统计，占全县早稻总面积80％的第一、第二两类稻田，发棵分蘖数和每穗结谷数大部分都达到了规划的要求。其余20％的第三类稻田目前正在加强田间管理。
    中共丽水县委会认为，只要田间管理扣紧每一环节，全县没有三类田，达到规划产量指标是完全可能的。　（尤淇）
