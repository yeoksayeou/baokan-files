　　Brief History of Men's 100-Meter Race Performance Development

　　The official world record for the men's 100-meter race only began in 1894, with the highest record at that time being 11.2 seconds. In 1912, an American athlete named Craig Gault improved it to 10.6 seconds. Nine years later, twenty-one-year-old Paddock replaced him with a time of 10.4 seconds. In 1936, American black athlete Jesse Owens further improved this record to 10.2 seconds. Since Owens set the record of 10.2 seconds, no one has been able to surpass it for nearly twenty years. It was not until August 3, 1956, that American black athlete Williams broke this record with a time of 10.1 seconds in a competition in West Germany, becoming the fastest man in the world in the 100-meter race. From 1894 to the present, in sixty-four years, the men's 100-meter record has improved by a total of 1.1 seconds.

　　China began having 100-yard races in 1902 and included them as an official competition item in 1910. Later, in some large cities, people changed 100 yards to 100 meters. In 1921, the best record for men's 100 meters was 11.6 seconds. In 1925, someone ran 11.2 seconds, and in 1927, a record of 11.1 seconds appeared. However, the national official competition record for men's 100 meters only appeared in 1923, with the best record at that time being 10.9 seconds. Later, Liu Changchun once refreshed the 10.9-second record with a time of 10.8 seconds. In 1933, Liu Changchun created a new national record with an updated time of 10.7 seconds, which has been maintained until now.

　　男子百公尺赛跑成绩发展简况
    男子一百公尺赛跑的正式世界纪录是从1894年起才有的，那时的最高成绩是十一秒二。在1912年有一个名叫礼品考特的美国运动员把它提高到十秒六。九年以后，二十一岁的帕达克以十秒四的成绩取而代之。1936年美国黑人运动员欧文斯又把这个成绩提高到十秒二。自从欧文斯创造了十秒二的纪录以后，在将近二十年的时间里，没有一个人能越过它。一直到1956年8月3日，美国黑人运动员威廉斯在西德的一次比赛中，才以十秒一的成绩打破了这个纪录，成了目前世界上百公尺跑得最快的人。从1894年到现在的六十四年中，男子一百公尺的成绩一共提高了一秒一。
    我国自从1902年开始有一百码赛跑，在1910年，列入了正式比赛项目。以后在个别大城市，有人把一百码改为一百公尺。1921年出现了男子一百公尺最好成绩十一秒六，1925年有人跑了十一秒二，1927年又出现了一个十一秒一的成绩。但是男子一百公尺全国性正式比赛的成绩却是1923年才出现的，那时的最好成绩是十秒九。以后刘长春曾经以十秒八的成绩刷新过十秒九的纪录。1933年，刘长春又以十秒七的更新成绩，创造了全国纪录，一直保持到现在。
