    Pulling Out White Flags and Planting Red Flags
    Most of Hubei's Third-Class Seedlings Have Improved
    (Our dispatch) Hubei Province farmers, having achieved an unprecedented bumper summer harvest, are actively strengthening field management of rice paddies to strive for an even greater autumn harvest.
    More than five million mu of early rice in Hubei Province is budding and heading; more than thirteen million mu of mid-season rice has also generally sprouted and turned green. However, due to a series of rainy days during planting, the quality of transplanting was affected, and topdressing fertilizer and weeding were not well followed up. As a result, the rice seedlings are growing unevenly, especially the early rice. According to a May survey, poorly growing third-class seedlings accounted for about 20%, and in some areas even reached over 30%.
    Since June, various parts of Hubei have actively launched an offensive against third-class seedlings. In the eastern Hubei areas of Hong'an, Huanggang, Guangji and other counties, on-site visits were universally organized, accounts were calculated and compared, reversing the slack mood of some cadres and the masses, and a movement of topdressing fertilizer and weeding was launched, rapidly changing the situation of the third-class seedlings. Many areas also achieved good results by inspecting field by field, plot by plot, and inserting red, green, and white flags for classification. For example, the Dengta People's Commune in Luotian County, through field-by-field inspection, separately inserted red, green, and white flags in the fields of first, second, and third-class seedlings, and wrote on the green flags: "Second-class seedlings are still good, catch up with the advanced and work hard, apply 100 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu, and quickly catch up with first-class seedlings." On the white flags, it was written: "Third-class seedlings are growing poorly, catch up with the advanced and make great efforts, apply 200 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu, not a single dan less." As a result, this commune mobilized 350 laborers, and in two days, all the second and third-class seedlings of early and mid-season rice were topdressed and weeded.
    All localities also pay close attention to the prevention and control of rice diseases and insect pests. In Xiaogan Prefecture alone, in early June, more than 700,000 people were mobilized, along with more than 48,000 various machines, and more than 750,000 mu of early japonica rice throughout the area were universally treated for insects two to three times. After the above efforts, the situation of a large number of third-class seedlings in various places has been changed, and the originally yellow and thin rice crops have now mostly improved.

    拔白旗插红旗
    湖北三类苗大都好转
    本报讯  获得夏季空前大丰收的湖北省农民，正积极加强水稻田间管理工作，力争秋季更大丰收。
    湖北省五百多万亩早稻正在打苞抽穗；一千三百多万亩中稻也已普遍发棵转青。但是，由于播种时碰上了一连串的雨天，栽秧质量受到影响而且追肥和中耕锄草工作也未很好地跟上去。因此，各地秧棵长得很不平衡，特别是早稻，据5月份的检查，生长不好的三类苗就占20％左右，有些地区达到30％以上。
    湖北各地自从6月份以来，积极向三类苗开展了攻势。鄂东地区的红安、黄冈、广济等县普遍组织现场参观，算账对比，扭转了部分干部和群众的松劲情绪，开展了追肥、薅草运动，迅速地改变了三类苗的局面。许多地区还通过丘丘检查、块块鉴定，插红、绿、白旗，收效很好。例如，罗田县灯塔一社通过丘丘检查，分别把红、绿、白旗插在一、二、三类苗的田里，并且在绿旗上写着：“二类苗还算好，赶先进抓紧搞，每亩追肥一百担，迅速赶上一类苗”。白旗上面写着：“三类苗生长差，赶先进要大抓，每亩追肥二百担，一担肥也不少下”。于是，这个社出动了三百五十个劳动力，两天时间就把早、中稻的二、三类苗，全部追了肥，薅了草。
    各地对水稻病虫害的防治也很注意。仅孝感专区在6月上旬就出动了七十多万大军，动员了各种器械四万八千多部，全区七十五万多亩早粳普遍防虫二次到三次。经过上述一番努力以后，各地大量三类苗的局面已经改变，原来长得黄瘦的稻禾，现在大都已好转。		  （田庄）
