Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: The 1.1 mu wheat experimental plot cultivated by Lan Shizhong, the first production team leader of Leminshe in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, has been inspected by the local leadership and the yield reached 2357 jin per mu.

The soil quality of this plot isn't particularly good. How did it achieve such a high yield? Preliminary conclusions point to: deep plowing, close planting, sufficient fertilizer, and good field management. The preceding crop on this 1.1 mu plot was corn. After the corn harvest last year, the land was immediately plowed, with plowing occurring every five days, each time deepening the tilled layer by five fen, for a total of four plowing sessions to a depth of seven cun. Plowing was followed immediately by harrowing to conserve moisture in the small clods of soil. At the time of sowing, 28 jin of seeds were used, with a sowing width of four cun and a row spacing of three cun. Base fertilizer was applied three times, totaling more than 330 dan of cattle manure and old wall soil. After the wheat was sown, top dressing was applied three times. The first time, 120 dan of old wall soil was applied; the second time, 100 dan of old wall soil and 6 jin of ammonium sulfate were applied; and the third time, 25 dan of liquid manure was sprinkled. After each top dressing, weeding and soil covering were carried out. When the wheat was budding, 5 jin of calcium superphosphate (solution) was sprayed on the roots. As a result, the wheat always grew well, with a general plant height of about 3.5 chi, approximately 630,000 plants per mu, and about 47 grains per ear.

Although this 1.1 mu wheat plot created a record of 2357 jin per mu, there were still some shortcomings in the cultivation techniques and fertilization methods. In particular, half of the wheat lodged in the later stage, which greatly affected the yield. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute have sent personnel to help Lan Shizhong study the causes of lodging, further summarize experiences, and find the key to continued production increase next year.

### 小麦丰产的新纪录  乐民社亩产2357斤

    小麦丰产的新纪录
    乐民社亩产2357斤
    新华社武汉8日电　湖北省谷城县乐民社第一生产队长蓝世忠种的一点一亩小麦试验地，经当地领导部门验收的结果，亩产达到二千三百五十七斤。
    这块地区的土质并不好，但是，它怎样获得高产的呢？根据初步总结主要经验是：深耕、密植、肥足、田间管理好。这一点一亩小麦的前作物种的是苞谷，去年苞谷收获以后，便随即翻耕，每隔五天犁地一次，每次加深耕层五分，共犁四次深达七寸，并且做到了随犁随耙，小坑土保墒。播种时，下种量二十八斤，播幅四寸，行距三寸。底肥下过三次，总共施牛栏粪、陈墙土三百三十多担，小麦播种后追肥三次，第一次施陈墙土一百二十担，第二次施陈墙土一百担和硫酸铵六斤，第三次泼水粪二十五担。每次追肥后都锄草盖肥，小麦含苞时又在根外喷洒过磷酸钙五斤（溶液）。最后，棵茂盛，不能锄草，只用手扯草一次。因此，小麦始终长得很好，一般株高约三尺五寸，每亩有六十三万株，每穗约四十七粒。
    这一点一亩小麦虽然创造了亩产二千三百五十七斤的最高纪录，但是在耕作技术上和施肥方法上还存在一些缺点，特别是到了后期小麦倒伏了一半，因而使产量受到了很大影响。最近，湖北省农业厅，华中农业科学研究所已派人帮助蓝世忠研究倒伏原因，进一步总结经验，找出明年继续增产的关键。
