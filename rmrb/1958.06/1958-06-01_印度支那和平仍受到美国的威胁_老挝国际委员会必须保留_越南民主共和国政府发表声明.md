Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 31st. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today released a statement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the necessity of retaining the International Commission for Laos. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The Royal Lao Government recently put forward a suggestion to cease the activities of the International Commission for Laos after the supplementary elections held on May 4, 1958. This suggestion involves the implementation of the agreements of the 1954 Geneva Conference, and therefore concerns all three countries of Indochina. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a participant in the Geneva Conference and a signatory to agreements concerning the cessation of hostilities in Laos, and as a neighboring government that consistently hopes to establish friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos, has always paid attention to the implementation of the Geneva Agreements regarding the issue of Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot but feel concerned about the suggestion to cease the activities of the International Commission for Laos. Therefore, proceeding from the interests of the common peace of Indochina and the interests of the peoples of Vietnam and Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam deems it necessary to state its views as follows:

    In the nearly four years since then, although the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on the issue of Laos has encountered many difficulties, some good results have been achieved. These are: the maintenance of peace; the realization of national unity and national harmony; the establishment of a coalition government; and the recent holding of supplementary elections. These achievements are due to the sincerity of both the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and also to the active contributions made by the International Commission, headed by India. These achievements not only conform to the legitimate aspirations of the Lao people, but also conform to the common interests of all the Indochinese nations. Therefore, these achievements have been warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese people, who regard them as a favorable factor in strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries. However, the situation in Laos is not yet completely normal: acts of reprisal and discrimination in violation of Article 15 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos are still occurring, and the political settlement stipulated in Article 14 has not yet been realized. The existence of the International Commission has always made a great contribution to the improvement of the situation in Laos. Therefore, it is necessary to retain this commission. Its existence will not only enable a political settlement to be achieved quickly, but will also play a role in consolidating peace in Laos and in acting as a supervisor of the correct implementation of the military provisions of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities.

    Due to the signing of the various agreements of the Geneva Conference, peace has been restored in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, but this peace has not yet been consolidated, and it is now still threatened by the interventionist activities of the US imperialists. The peace of Indochina is indivisible; this was recognized in the discussions at the Geneva Conference, and the spirit of the final declaration of the conference, especially Articles 4 and 5, reaffirmed this point. According to the provisions of Article 39 of the Geneva Agreement on Laos, Article 46 of the Geneva Agreement on Vietnam, and Article 25 of the Geneva Agreement on Cambodia, it is clear that the three international commissions should continue their activities until the political issues in the three countries have been fully resolved. In the current situation in Indochina, to cease the activities of an international commission in one country, such as Laos, without considering the resolution of the political issues in the other two countries, would endanger the effective implementation of the various agreements of the Geneva Conference and the activities of the various international commissions. Such a practice is contrary to the spirit and the letter of the various agreements of the Geneva Conference.

    Based on the above reasons, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it is absolutely necessary to retain the International Commission for Laos in the current environment. However, according to Article 39 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, the activities and structure of the International Commission can be reduced.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hopes that the governments concerned will adopt an attitude that is in line with the requirements of continuing to implement the various agreements of the Geneva Conference and retaining the International Commission for Laos for the sake of peace in Laos, Indochina and Southeast Asia.

### 印度支那和平仍受到美国的威胁  老挝国际委员会必须保留  越南民主共和国政府发表声明

    印度支那和平仍受到美国的威胁
    老挝国际委员会必须保留
    越南民主共和国政府发表声明
    新华社河内31日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部今天公布了越南民主共和国政府就老挝国际委员会必须继续保留的问题发表的声明。声明全文如下：
    老挝王国政府最近提出了关于在1958年5月4日举行补充选举以后停止老挝国际委员会的活动的建议。这项建议牵涉到1954年日内瓦会议的各项协定的履行问题，因此同印度支那三国都有关系。越南民主共和国政府作为日内瓦会议的参加者和关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定的签署者，并且作为经常希望同老挝王国建立友好关系的一个邻国政府，一向注意履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协定。对于停止老挝国际委员会的活动的建议，越南民主共和国政府不能不感到忧虑，因此，从印度支那的共同和平的利益和越南、老挝两国人民的利益出发，越南民主共和国政府认为有必要把自己的观点说明如下：
    近四年以来，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协定的履行虽然遇到过许多困难，但是已经取得了一些良好的成果，那就是：保持了和平；实现了国家的统一和民族的和睦；成立了联合政府；最近举行了补充选举。这些成果是由于老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队双方的诚意，同时也是由于以印度为首的国际委员会作出的积极贡献而取得的。这些成果不仅符合于老挝人民的正当愿望，而且符合于各印度支那各民族的共同利益，因此，这些成果已经得到越南人民的热烈欢迎，他们认为这是加强两国之间的友好关系的一个有利因素。但是，老挝的局势还不是完全正常：违反关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定第十五条的报复和歧视行为还在继续发生，第十四条规定的政治解决还没有实现。国际委员会的存在对于老挝局势的改善一向作出很大的贡献，因此，保留这个委员会是必要的。它的存在不仅将要使政治解决迅速实现，而且还起着巩固老挝的和平以及作为正确履行停止敌对行动协定的军事条款的监督者的作用。
    由于日内瓦会议的各项协定的签订，在老挝、越南和柬埔寨已经恢复了和平，但是这种和平还没有得到巩固，而且现在还受到美帝国主义者的干涉活动的威胁。印度支那的和平是不可分割的，在日内瓦会议上的历次讨论中承认了这一点，会议的最后宣言的精神，特别是第四、五两条又确认了这一点。根据日内瓦会议关于老挝问题协定的第三十九条、关于越南问题协定的第四十六条和关于柬埔寨问题协定的第二十五条的规定，显然，在三个国家的政治问题还没有完全解决以前，三个国际委员会应当继续进行活动。在印度支那目前的形势下，在一个国家里，例如在老挝，停止国际委员会的活动，而不考虑到其他两个国家政治问题的解决，这样就会使得日内瓦会议各项协定的有效履行和各个国际委员会的活动遭到危险的影响。这种做法是违反日内瓦会议各项协定的精神和条文的。
    基于上述理由，越南民主共和国政府认为，在目前环境下，保留老挝国际委员会是完全必要的，但是根据关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定第三十九条的规定，国际委员会的活动和编制可以缩减。
    越南民主共和国政府希望，有关各国政府能够采取一种同为了老挝、印度支那和东南亚和平的利益而继续履行日内瓦会议各项协定和保留老挝国际委员会的要求相符合的态度。
