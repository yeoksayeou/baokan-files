　　Millennial Dragon Kilns Change Their Appetite: Formerly Ate Pine, Now Eat Coal

　　(Our Dispatch) The transformation of dragon kilns and stepped kilns for firing ceramics in Yixing, Jiangsu; Liling, Hunan; Shiwan, Guangdong; Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, and other places, using coal or gas instead of firewood as fuel, has been successfully tested. Recently, more than 100 representatives from southern provinces held an on-site meeting in Yixing, Jiangsu, to promote it comprehensively.

　　During the meeting, the Yixing Architectural Ceramics Factory No. 2, in three hours, without spending a penny or using a piece of iron, transformed a pottery kiln using the principle of a tunnel kiln, using coal powder as fuel. The effect is excellent. It can eliminate the need for a blower, and production and kiln transformation do not interfere with each other. The kiln operation is simple, the labor intensity is reduced, and each kiln can also reduce ten workers, saving labor. Fuel consumption is reduced, and costs are lowered. When burning firewood, each kiln requires 672 yuan in fuel costs. After switching to burning coal, it only costs 126 yuan, saving 546 yuan in fuel costs per kiln. Based on burning 120 kilns a year, one kiln can save 65,520 yuan in fuel costs annually. The firing time per kiln has also been reduced from 21 hours to 11 hours, accelerating the production turnover rate by almost double. The product quality has also improved significantly, with the percentage of qualified products increasing from 73% to 88%, and the fired products are whiter, brighter, and more resonant.

　　Based on unifying thinking and understanding the methods, the representatives of the provinces have formulated plans and proposed specific measures, striving to complete the kiln transformation task within the year.　　　　　　　(Huang Gang)

　　千年龙窑胃口改  昔食松柴今食煤
    本报讯　江苏宜兴、湖南澧陵、广东石湾、江西景德镇等地改造烧陶瓷的龙窑、阶级窑，用煤或煤气代替木柴为燃料已经试验成功。最近，南方各省代表百余人在江苏宜兴召开现场会议，全面推广。
    在会议期间，宜兴建筑陶瓷二厂以三小时时间，不花一文钱，不用一块铁，采用轮窑原理，以煤粉为燃料改造的陶器窑，效果十分好。可以不要鼓风机，生产改窑两不误。烧窑操作简便，劳动强度减轻，一窑还可以减少十个工，节约了劳动力。减少了燃料耗费，降低了成本。烧柴时每窑要燃料费六百七十二元，改烧煤后只要一百二十六元，即每窑节约燃料费五百四十六元。以一年烧一百二十窑计，一座窑每年就可以节约燃料费六万五千五百二十元。每窑烧成时间也从二十一小时减少到十一小时，加速了生产周转率几近一倍。产品质量也有显著提高，正品率从73％提高到88％，烧出的成品又白、又亮、又响。
    在统一思想、摸清做法的基础上，各省代表纷纷订出规划，提出具体措施，争取年内全部完成改窑任务。　　　　　　　（黄岗）
