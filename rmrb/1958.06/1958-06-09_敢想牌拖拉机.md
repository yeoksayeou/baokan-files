　　"Dare to Think" Brand Tractor
    The Guiding Farm Implement Factory in Hunan Province recently successfully trial-produced a universal tractor using indigenous methods, naming it "Dare to Think No. 58." This universal tractor has a body weight of 120 kilograms and four horsepower. It can plow twelve mu of land per day, generate 1.5 kilowatts of electricity, and mill 600 jin of rice per hour.
    With the exception of a very few parts, this tractor was entirely made by hand. The belt pulley, wheels, and other major components are of a mixed iron and wood structure. Many new technical problems were solved using indigenous methods. The factory does not have a single engineer or technician. There was only one comrade who had been sent to the countryside who had visited tractor exhibitions in Changsha and Beijing (he was the main designer). They manufactured this small universal tractor in eight days and eight nights. (Liu Jigui)

　　敢想牌拖拉机
    湖南桂东农具厂最近用土办法试制成功一台万能拖拉机，命名为“敢想58号”。这台万能拖拉机，机身重一百二十公斤，四马力，每天能犁田十二亩，可发电一点五瓩，每小时可碾米六百市斤。
    这部拖拉机除极少数零件外，全部是手工作成，皮带盘、车轮等主要部件都是铁木混合结构，很多技术上的新问题都是用土办法解决的。这个厂没有一个工程师或技术员，只有一个下放来的同志曾在长沙和北京参观过拖拉机（他是主要设计人），他们以八天八夜的时间就制成了这台小型万能拖拉机。　　（刘际圭）
