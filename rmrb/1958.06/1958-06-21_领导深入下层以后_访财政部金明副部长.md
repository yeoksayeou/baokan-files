    After Leaders Go Deep into the Grassroots
    —An Interview with Jin Ming, Vice Minister of Finance
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Mu
    In order to implement the rectification method of "attacking from both inside and outside, combining the top and bottom," the Ministry of Finance sent thirty-four of its fifty-odd directors and bureau chiefs to various locations across the country from the beginning of this year to May, leaving their footprints in twenty-three provinces and cities across the country, as well as factories, mines, and rural areas within these provinces and cities, from Qingdao in the east to Yumen in the west. Together with local cadres at all levels and workers and peasants, they held 244 meetings ranging from hundreds of people to just a few, engaging in heart-to-heart talks and mutual criticism and debate, conducting an unprecedented large-scale in-depth investigation and research on financial work. Recently, I interviewed Jin Ming, Vice Minister of Finance, and asked him to talk about his own experiences in this matter. Vice Minister Jin straightforwardly said to me: "Rather than saying that this in-depth involvement at the grassroots level has indeed helped solve some specific problems below, I would say that the rich practical experience and the creativity of the masses have greatly promoted the ideological liberation of the leading cadres of the Ministry of Finance, because this has a more profound significance for the improvement of the entire work." He said that this can be summarized in twelve characters: everyone "sees something with their own eyes, thinks something in their hearts, and gains something greatly."
    To illustrate his view, Vice Minister Jin cited many vivid examples seen at the grassroots level to show how the rich practical experience, especially the new situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, has enlightened the thinking of the leading cadres of the Ministry of Finance. In an agricultural cooperative in Macheng County, Hubei Province, the state originally planned to allocate 72,000 yuan to help farmers build a reservoir last winter and this spring. However, due to the full mobilization of the peasants' enthusiasm, the masses built their own sheds, brought their own tools, and used local materials, using labor as an investment in the cooperative. They only spent 4,200 yuan to purchase important materials such as water pipes and cement, and the reservoir was built. In Shanghai, 12,000 factories need to re-evaluate their working capital quotas starting in April this year. When this work was first done in 1956, only a few cadres from the finance and banking departments relied on a top-down approach to calculate the amount for each factory, spending half a year to assess only more than 600 enterprises, accounting for 5% of the 12,000 enterprises in the city. Based on this speed, it would take ten years to assess the working capital quotas of all enterprises in the city. This time, the approach was changed. After mobilizing the masses to have each factory assess itself, not only could all assessments be completed in two or three months, but also the number of state allocations needed by the factories that had already been assessed was greatly reduced. On the other hand, many situations similar to the following were also discovered at the grassroots level, making people more deeply aware that some of the regulations and systems formulated by the financial departments in the past were indeed too rigidly controlled, restricting the development of productive forces. For example, some factories implemented large-scale adjustments of stagnant materials among themselves in order to make full use of existing inventory materials. However, according to the current tax system, if materials are transferred to other industrial systems, taxes must be paid in accordance with regulations. After the leading comrades who went deep into the grassroots level discovered this unreasonable regulation that hindered the development of production, they dealt with it in a timely manner. Vice Minister Jin said that in the face of these situations, the leading cadres of the Ministry of Finance deeply realized that the key issue in the leading work of the Ministry of Finance is that they must clarify the idea of relying on the whole Party and the masses to do a good job in finance, establish the viewpoint of serving politics and production in financial work, and correct the past erroneous view of mystifying financial work, believing that only financial cadres know how to manage and supervise finance. The leading cadres brought this view, which was derived from practice, back to the ministry, combined it with the rectification of the organs, and discussed and debated with the masses in the ministry, which greatly promoted the in-depth rectification and reform work of the organs. According to the guiding ideology mentioned above, the Ministry of Finance quickly checked 368 of the major and widely involved items among all 1,450 regulations and systems, made handling opinions on the unreasonable ones, and has begun to gradually reform them. Concrete plans have also been made for further implementing the decentralization of the financial system and streamlining institutions.
    Speaking of this, Vice Minister Jin emphasized that after this guideline for improving financial work was found, it also pointed out the direction for how financial work can achieve a Great Leap Forward. He said that in the early stage of entering in-depth reform in the rectification movement, the Ministry of Finance was once distressed about how to keep up with the national leap forward situation. Some people believed that it was easy for the industrial sector to leap forward, but the Ministry of Finance is a comprehensive department, and whether it is the increase in national revenue and expenditure or the rational balance of revenue and expenditure, it requires the consistent efforts of the whole country. It was difficult to find a way for financial work to leap forward all at once. Now the view has changed. Everyone believes that as long as we truly rely on the whole Party and the masses to manage finance and earnestly establish the viewpoint of serving politics and production, it will greatly promote the increase in national income this year. The increase in national income may not be a matter of several hundred million yuan, but a matter of several billion yuan.
    "One thing understood, everything is understood. We are now increasingly aware of the importance of the central government's repeated emphasis on leading cadres contacting the masses and going deep into reality," Vice Minister Jin said to me. After a large number of leading cadres liberated their minds through rectification and going deep into reality, it can be seen that the leadership level has been improved to some extent. This situation is first and foremost manifested in the ideological methods and work methods of the leading cadres, who have begun to be able to do "from virtual to real, and then from real to virtual." The situation of "not being able to be virtual" and being restricted by complex affairs is changing. He said that in the past, people often "lacked taste in language" when discussing principled issues, and their thinking could not be expanded. However, in various specific businesses, they were at a loss because the guiding ideology was not clear. Now the situation has changed. People's thinking has become lively, and the phenomenon of "arguing over numbers" in meetings in the past has been greatly reduced. After discussion and debate on political principles, many specific problems have been quickly resolved because of ideological unity. Vice Minister Jin also excitedly told me that due to the enrichment of leadership thinking after contacting reality, the leading cadres of the Ministry of Finance have begun to boldly support the practice of relying on the masses to manage finance. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently contracted construction investment to enterprise units in more than ten factories and mines, mobilizing the masses to earnestly implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. As a result, the same amount of funds can do twice as much. If this practice can be gradually promoted to all localities, all business departments, and even the cells of my country's socialist economy—every factory, mine, enterprise, and agricultural cooperative—it will fundamentally change the face of financial work. Vice Minister Jin said that this new line of thought for leading cadres has begun to free themselves from considering financial work only from numbers, reports, and cumbersome regulations.
    Finally, when I asked, "In the past, some leading cadres often went to the grassroots units to inspect work and conduct investigations and research, but why couldn't they achieve such significant results today?" Vice Minister Jin believed that this must be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the tremendous role that the rectification movement has already played in the past year. He said that the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" proposed by the Party Central Committee, as well as instructions to adjust the relationship between the central and local governments and reform those unreasonable regulations and systems that restrict productive forces, have given us ideological weapons; and after rectification, the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses has been raised, their enthusiasm is full, and many vivid deeds that were unimaginable in the past have emerged, powerfully attacking the conservative thinking in financial work. At the same time, rectification has also changed the attitude of leading cadres towards reality and the masses. The idea of "being a student" has been widely established. The socialist democratic form of free airing of views, big contending, and big debating, which has gradually become complete during the rectification, enables leading cadres to go down and debate with grassroots cadres and workers and peasants on an equal footing; humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and everyone can liberate their minds on the spot in the face of rich practical experience, which will inevitably enable leading cadres to truly achieve ideological depth after going deep into the grassroots and continuously improve themselves.

    领导深入下层以后
    ——访财政部金明副部长
    本报记者　袁木
    财政部为了贯彻“内外夹攻、上下结合”的整风方法，从今年初到5月，在财政部的五十多位司局长以上的领导干部中，有三十四人曾经东到青岛，西至玉门，在全国二十三个省市和这些省市的厂矿和农村中留下了他们的足迹。他们同地方上的各级干部和工人农民一起，开了二百四十四次从几百人到几个人的会议，上下倾心交谈，互相鸣放争辩，对财政工作进行了一次空前规模的深入的调查研究。最近，记者访问了财政部金明副部长，请他就这件事谈一谈他自己的体会。金副部长开门见山地对我说：“我与其对你说这次深入下层确实帮助下面解决了一些具体问题，毋宁说丰富的实际和群众创造大大地促进了财政部领导干部思想的解放，因为这对于整个工作的改进有着更加深远的意义。”他说，在这一点上可以用十二个字加以概括，这就是人人“目有所睹，心有所思，大有所得”。
    为了阐述他的这种看法，金副部长列举了许多在下面看到的生动事例，来说明丰富的实际特别是全国大跃进的新形势，如何启发了财政部领导干部的思想。在湖北省麻城县的一个农业合作社，国家原计划拨给他们七万二千元，帮助农民在去冬今春修建一座水库，但由于充分发挥了农民的积极性，群众自盖工棚，自带工具，就地取材，用劳动力作为给社里的投资，只是购买水管和水泥等重要材料花了四千二百元，就把水库修了起来。上海有一万二千个工厂需要从今年4月开始重新核定流动资金定额。1956年第一次做这个工作时，只靠财政、银行部门的几个干部，自上而下地一个厂一个厂去核算，花了半年的时间，只核了六百多个企业，占全市一万二千个企业的5％。根据这个速度，核完全市所有企业的流动资金定额，需要十年的时间。这一次做法改变了，经过发动群众由各厂自己核定，不仅两三个月就可以全部核定，并且已经核定的工厂，需要国家拨款的数字都减低很多。另一方面，在基层也发现了不少类似下面的情况，使得人们更深刻地认识到过去财政部门制定的规章制度中，有一部分的确是统的过多、过死，束缚了生产力的发展。例如，有些工厂为了充分利用现有库存材料，相互间实行呆滞物资大调剂。可是，按照现行税收制度的规定，材料如果调拨给别的产业系统，就要照章纳税。这种妨碍生产发展的不合理的规章制度，经深入基层的领导同志发现后，就作了及时的处理。金副部长说，面对着这些情况，财政部的领导干部深刻地体会到，财政部领导工作的关键问题是必须明确依靠全党和群众办好财政的思想，在财政工作中树立为政治和生产服务的观点，纠正过去把财政工作神秘化，认为只有财政干部才懂得如何管理和监督财政的错误看法。领导干部把这种从实际中得出的看法又带到部里，结合机关整风，同部里群众一齐鸣放辩论，这对机关整风的深入整改工作，起了很大的推动作用。根据上面所说的那种指导思想，财政部很快就对全部一千四百五十种规章制度中的重大的、涉及面广的三百六十八件，进行了检查，对不合理的作出处理意见，并且已经开始逐步进行改革，对于进一步实行财政体制下放和精简机构，也已做出具体规划。
    谈到这里时，金副部长强调地说，这条改进财政工作的方针找到以后，它还为财政工作如何实现大跃进指明了方向。他说，在整风运动进入深入整改的初期，财政部曾经一度为如何才能跟上全国的跃进形势而苦闷过。有人认为工业部门跃进容易，财政部是综合部门，不论全国收支的增加或支出的节约，收支的合理平衡，都需要全国上下的一致努力，一下子找不到财政工作如何跃进的路子。现在看法改变了，大家认为，只要在真正依靠全党和群众办财政，切实树立为政治和生产服务的观点，那么就将对全国今年的收入增加发生极大的促进作用，全国收入的增加很可能不是几亿元，而是几十亿元的问题了。
    “一通百通，我们现在正越来越深刻地认识到中央一再强调领导干部联系群众、深入实际的重要意义”，金副部长对我说，大批领导干部通过整风和深入实际解放了思想之后，可以看出领导水平已有所提高。这种情况首先突出的表现在领导干部在思想方法和工作方法上，已经开始能够做到“从虚到实，再从实到虚”，“虚不起来”和被庞杂的事务束缚住思想的状况，正在改变。他说，过去人们常常在讨论原则问题上“语言乏味”，思想展不开，而在各项具体业务上则因为指导思想不明确而莫衷一是，现在情况变了，人们的思想活泼了，过去开会就是“嘴吵争数字”的现象大大减少了，经过在政治原则上的鸣放争辩，许多具体问题都由于思想一致之后而很快迎刃而解。金副部长还兴奋的告诉我，由于接触实际之后丰富了领导思想，财政部领导干部已经开始大胆支持依靠群众办财政的做法。冶金部最近在十多个厂矿企业中，把建设投资包干给企业单位，发动群众切实贯彻勤俭建国的方针，结果同样的数目资金却可以办两倍的事情。这种作法如果能逐步推广到各个地方，一切事业部门以至我国社会主义经济的细胞——每个厂矿企业和每个农业合作社中去，将使财政工作的面貌发生根本变化。金副部长说，领导干部这种新的思想脉络，已经开始把自己仅仅从数字、表报和繁琐的规章制度中考虑财政工作的状况中解脱出来。　　最后，当记者问到“过去有些领导干部也常到基层单位去视察工作和调查研究，为甚么却不能达到今天这种重大收获”的问题时，金副部长认为这不能不归功于党中央的正确领导和一年来整风运动所已经发生的巨大作用。他说，党中央提出的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的建设总路线，和调整中央同地方的分权关系，改革那些束缚生产力的不合理的规章制度等指示，给了我们以思想武器；而经过整风，干部、群众中的社会主义觉悟提高，干劲十足，涌现出许多过去难以想像的生动事迹，有力地打击了财政工作中的保守思想。同时，经过整风，也使领导干部对待实际和对待群众的态度发生了变化。“当学生”的思想普遍树立起来了。整风中逐步完整起来的大鸣大放大辩论的社会主义民主形式，使领导干部下去后以平等的态度同基层干部和工农群众一起鸣放争辩；虚心听取群众意见，大家一起在丰富的实际面前就地解放思想，这就必然会使领导干部深入下层以后能够真正做到思想深入，不断地提高自己。
