The Party and Government Show Deep Concern
Living Conditions of Herdsmen in Northern Tibet Improve
Xinhua News Agency, Heihe, 18th – Several relief work groups dispatched from Heihe, a city in the northern Tibetan pastoral area, have traveled throughout twenty-nine tribes in the past month, distributing relief grain to more than two thousand elderly, weak, and impoverished herdsmen. At the same time, the People's Government has adopted the method of "work-for-relief" to absorb some herdsmen with difficult living conditions into various construction projects.

Currently, the Tibetan pastoral area is in the season between harvests. In previous years, at this time, many impoverished herdsmen often wandered to other areas to beg, only returning home at the time of the autumn harvest. This year, some of them can settle down on the grasslands and engage in production, while others have become workers with a certain income, and they no longer have to worry about not having enough to eat.

Staff members from the Heihe Health Clinic and the Veterinary Disease Prevention Station also accompanied the work groups to various tribes. They relieved the suffering of the broad masses of herdsmen from diseases and saved hundreds and thousands of cattle and sheep.

Since the northern Tibetan pastoral area suffered from natural disasters last year, the herdsmen have received relief three times. The People's Government has sent them more than 130,000 jin of relief grain and more than 4,000 jin of tea.

    党和政府深切关怀
    西藏北部牧民生活改善
    新华社黑河18日电　从西藏北部牧区城市黑河派出的几个救济工作组，在最近一个多月时间中走遍了二十九个部落，给两千多个老弱贫苦的牧民分发了救济粮。同时，人民政府还采取以工代赈的办法，吸收一些生活困难的牧民参加各种建设工作。
    目前西藏牧区正是青黄不接的季节。往年这时，许多贫苦牧民常往外区流浪讨乞，到秋收时才能回家。今年，他们有的可以在草原上安居下来从事生产，有的成为有一定收入的工人，再也不愁没有吃的了。
    黑河卫生院和兽疫防治所的工作人员，也随工作组到了各部落。他们为广大牧民解除疾病痛苦，救活了成百上千头牛羊。
    自从去年藏北牧区遭到天灾以后，牧民们曾先后三次得到救济，人民政府给他们送去十三万多斤救济粮和四千多斤茶叶。
