　　A Red Flower of Socialism
　　——Introducing Nursing Homes for Rural "Five Guarantees" Households
　　By our reporter Wang Zhuofei
　　At the National Exhibition of Advanced Units in Welfare, Relief and Social Security, Social Welfare, and Production, visitors were very interested in the nursing homes for "Five Guarantees" households run by agricultural cooperatives. People used the phrase "Another big red flower of socialism is blooming in the countryside" to praise it.
　　The exhibition told people that the "Five Guarantees" are a form of social welfare undertaken by agricultural cooperatives, as stipulated in Article 30 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft). Currently, more than 3.13 million households and more than 5.19 million widowed, orphaned, and childless cooperative members across the country are enjoying the "Five Guarantees" benefits provided by agricultural cooperatives. Some of these "Five Guarantees" households live dispersed, with agricultural cooperatives assigning specific individuals to care for them; others live in nursing homes. After the high tide of agricultural cooperation, especially since the great leap forward in agricultural production this spring, agricultural cooperatives have been establishing a large number of nursing homes to better care for "Five Guarantees" households and to meet the needs of great developments in production (referring to freeing up more people who were dispersed to care for "Five Guarantees" households to participate in production). Zhen'an County in Shaanxi Province, which has done an excellent job in "Five Guarantees" work, has already sent all 2,225 "Five Guarantees" households, totaling 3,598 people, into nursing homes. Dengfeng County in Henan Province has established 122 nursing homes.
　　"Five Guarantees" households enter nursing homes (or homes of happiness, happiness teams) entirely on a voluntary basis. Many nursing homes have collective meals and also small stoves; collective dormitories and also single rooms. Some nursing homes also have health kits. During holidays, especially during the New Year, township cadres, cooperative cadres, members of the Communist Youth League, and Young Pioneers visit the elderly, and women also come to the nursing homes to help cook. Living in the warm socialist family, the elderly live a happy and carefree life, and the miserable life of widowed, orphaned, and childless people who "have no one to care for them when they are old and no one to bury them when they die" is gone forever.
　　The exhibition introduced a nursing home for "Five Guarantees" households to the audience.
　　This is a nursing home for "Five Guarantees" households run by Jingfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Funing County, Hebei Province. On the day the nursing home was established, the whole village was filled with gongs and drums and joy. The elderly put on new clothes made for them by the agricultural cooperative and entered the nursing home happily. New couplets were pasted on the gate of the nursing home: "Having support and reliance, spending socialist years together; carefree and worry-free, celebrating a happy life." Three elderly people live in the nursing home: 93-year-old Granny Tian, who worked as a servant for landlords for 60 years, 83-year-old Grandpa Li, who worked as a farmhand all his life, and 81-year-old Grandpa Qiu. The agricultural cooperative takes good care of them, and the living standard is the same as that of ordinary cooperative members, 82 yuan per person per year, and it is planned to increase it to 102 yuan after the autumn harvest. The clothes of the elderly are sewn by the agricultural cooperative, and grain and firewood are supplied by the agricultural cooperative on a regular basis. In daily life, the accountant of the agricultural cooperative is responsible for arrangements, and women are sent by the agricultural cooperative to make dumplings for them during the New Year and holidays. The Party branch of the agricultural cooperative also specially assigned a female Communist Party member, Ma Fengling, to be responsible for the hygiene of the nursing home and to help the elderly wash their clothes. The exhibition also displayed a set of photos introducing the nursing home. From these photos, people saw that the three elderly people were smiling and living a happy old age, and they saw the agricultural cooperative's meticulous care for them. Granny Tian often said to the cooperative cadres: "I used to want to die sooner to suffer less; now I want to live a few more years and enjoy my old age."
　　In agricultural cooperatives in other regions, the care and attention received by "Five Guarantees" households are the same as those in Jingfeng Agricultural Cooperative. For example, the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, stipulates: "Five Guarantees" households receive 480 catties of unprocessed grain, 1,200 catties of firewood, one set of single clothing, and two pairs of single shoes per person per year, one set of cotton clothing and one pair of cotton shoes every two years, and one cotton quilt every five years, and one yuan of pocket money per person per month; Liyu Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhu County stipulates: "Each person receives 4.9 yuan per month for living expenses, two sets of cotton clothing every three years, and three sets of single clothing every two years." Therefore, the "Five Guarantees" households in Dengfeng County sing the praises of their new life in this way:
　　Being orphaned and widowed is bitter, being orphaned and widowed is hard,
　　It has never changed for thousands of years,
　　The Communist Party leads the change of society,
　　Spending the old age in a happy home.
　　The widowed, orphaned, and childless cooperative members who enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment have much better conditions after entering the nursing homes than living dispersed. Seeing that everyone is working hard, they also want to participate in some labor. After their repeated requests, the agricultural cooperatives agree to let them participate in some light labor, such as guarding orchards, planting fruit trees, raising fish, raising chickens, raising rabbits, raising ducks, and growing vegetables. After participating in these labors, they not only improve their physical and mental health but also increase their income and make their lives more prosperous. The exhibition introduced the situation of the "Five Guarantees" elderly in Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, participating in production such as raising pigs, raising rabbits, raising geese, and growing vegetables. The "Five Guarantees" team has a total of 36 "Five Guarantees" households and 43 people. In 1957, the income was more than 6,600 yuan, and the life has been greatly improved. Some "Five Guarantees" households also have savings. Last year, 24 "Five Guarantees" households in this team saved 275 yuan. This is really a miracle. Some of these people were beggars before liberation, relief recipients after liberation, and "Five Guarantees" households after cooperation, and now they have become wealthy households!
　　Finally, people saw a large photo. This is a photo of three old men from the "Five Guarantees" Home of Xing'an Village Agricultural Cooperative in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, laughing happily as they look at the fruitful fruits in their own tomato garden. How happy they live! The audience constantly praised the nursing homes, saying that this is a paradise created by socialism for these helpless elderly. (Attached pictures)

　　社会主义的一朵红花
　　——介绍农村“五保”户的养老院
    本报记者　王濯非
    在全国优抚救济社会福利事业生产展览会上，观众们对展览会上介绍的农业社举办的“五保”户养老院很感兴趣。人们用“社会主义在农村又开放了一朵大红花”这一句话来赞美它。
    展览会告诉人们，“五保”是按照全国农业发展纲要（草案）第三十条的规定，由农业社举办的一种社会福利事业。现在，全国有三百一十三万多户、五百一十九万多鳏寡孤独的社员享受着农业社的“五保”待遇。其中有一部分“五保”户是分散居住的，农业社指定专人照顾他们；还有一部分“五保”户在养老院里生活。在农业合作化高潮以后，特别是今春的农业生产大跃进以来，农业社为了更好地照顾“五保”户和适应生产大发展的需要（指可以多抽一些分散照顾“五保”户的人参加生产），大量举办养老院。陕西省“五保”工作做得很好的镇安县，已经把二千二百二十五户“五保”户、三千五百九十八人全部送进了养老院。河南省登封县已成立了一百二十二个养老院。
    “五保”户进养老院（或幸福院、幸福队）完全根据自愿原则。许多养老院内有集体伙食，也有小锅灶；有集体宿舍，也有单间房。有些养老院还设有保健箱。每逢假日，特别是过年过节时，乡干部、社干部、共青团员、少先队员都要去看望老人，妇女们还到养老院帮助做饭做菜。老人们生活在社会主义的温暖大家庭中，无忧无虑地过着幸福的晚年，那种“老了没人养，死了没人葬”的鳏寡孤独者的悲惨生活是一去不复返了。
    展览会向观众介绍了一个“五保”户养老院。
    这是河北省抚宁县景峰农业社举办的一个“五保”户养老院。在成立养老院的那一天，全村敲锣打鼓，一片欢乐。老人们穿上了农业社给他们做的新衣服，高高兴兴地进了养老院。养老院的大门口贴上了新对联：“有依有靠，共度社会主义；无忧无虑，欢庆幸福生活”。养老院里住着三位老人：给地主当了六十年佣人的九十三岁的田老太太，当了一辈子长工的八十三岁的李老汉和八十一岁的仇老汉。农业社对他们照顾得很周到，生活标准和一般社员一样，每人每年八十二元，秋收后准备提高为一百零二元。老人们的衣服都是农业社替他们缝的，粮食和烧柴都由农业社定时定量供应。在日常生活上由农业社会计负责安排，过年过节由农业社派妇女给他们包饺子吃，农业社党支部还专门派了一个女共产党员马凤玲负责养老院的卫生工作，帮助老人洗衣服。展览会还展出了介绍这个养老院的一套照片，人们从这些照片上看到了这三位老人笑容满面，过着幸福的晚年，看到了农业社对他们无微不至的照顾。田老太太常对社干部说：“我过去想早些死了好，少受点罪；现在又想多活几年，享享老福。”
    在其他地区的农业社里，“五保”户受到的关怀和照顾，也和在景峰农业社里的“五保”户一样。例如在安徽省寿县爱国农业社规定：“五保”户每人每年四百八十斤原粮、一千二百斤烧柴、一套单衣、两双单鞋，两年一套棉衣、一双棉鞋，五年一床棉被，每人每月一元零用钱；芜湖县鲤鱼农业社规定：
  “每人每月生活费四元九角，三年发两套棉衣，两年发三套单衣。因此，登封县的“五保”户，这样歌颂自己的新生活：
    孤寡苦，孤寡难，
    千年万代没改变，
    共产党领导把社会变，
    幸福院里度晚年。
    享受“五保”待遇的鳏寡孤独的社员进入养老院以后，比分散居住的条件要好得多。他们看到大家都在紧张的劳动，也想参加一些劳动，农业社在他们再三要求之下，答应他们参加一些轻微劳动，如看果园、种果树、养鱼、养鸡、养兔、养鸭、种菜等。他们参加这些劳动以后，不仅增进身心健康，还增加了收入，使生活更加富裕。展览会向观众介绍了安徽省寿县爱国农业社的“五保”户老人参加养猪、养兔、养鹅、种菜等生产的情况。这个养老队一共三十六家“五保”户、四十三人，1957年收入六千六百多元，生活大大改善，有些“五保”户还有了积余。去年，这个队里就有二十四户“五保”户储蓄了二百七十五元。这真是奇迹，这些人有些解放前是讨饭户，解放后是救济户，合作化后是“五保”户，现在居然成了富裕户！
    最后，人们看到了一张大幅照片，这是河北省藁城县兴安村农业社“五保”院的三位老大爷在自己种植的西红柿园地里看着丰硕的果实在欢笑的照片。他们生活得是多么幸福啊！观众们不断称赞养老院好，说这是社会主义给这些无依无靠的老人所创造的乐园。（附图片）
