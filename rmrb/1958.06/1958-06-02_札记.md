    Something's Wrong
    The American press has become alert to the "anti-American sentiment" occurring in many countries. Because "anti-American sentiment" is growing stronger and is very common.
    An article in the American magazine "The Nation" listed a very important fact and figure: "In the past ten years, more than fifty U.S. Information Agency offices in twenty-one countries have been bombed, burned, or vandalized, most of which have occurred in recent years."
    The people of twenty-one countries, driven to extremes of anger, have taken action against the U.S. Information Agency offices. Doesn't this show the hatred of hundreds of millions of people for America's imperialist aggressive policies?
    However, the author of this article in "The Nation" only lightly answered this question: "There must be something wrong with American policy." This is of course not a question of right or wrong, but a question of whether to invade the people of other countries or to respect the people of other countries.
    Worry
    Sir Harold Himsworth, Secretary of the British Medical Research Council, revealed at a meeting of the Royal Doctors' Remuneration Committee that many famous British medical experts, especially bacteriologists, experimental geneticists, and experts in the use of nuclear energy for health care, are being bought by the United States with "very attractive" salaries. To this end, the Sir warned worriedly: "One day we will find that Britain will be stripped clean in terms of the basic departments of medicine."
    It seems that this British Sir has learned the taste of the Anglo-American policy of "interdependence" and "good partnership" from personal experience. On the one hand, the United States strictly keeps secrets from Britain on some so-called scientific achievements, and on the other hand, it resorts to all means to undermine Britain. The logic of the "big partner" America is: "What's yours is mine, and what's mine is still mine."
    It can be seen that Sir Himsworth's worries are well-founded. However, the matter does not stop there. As the United States is stepping up its efforts to undermine the foundations of the British Empire in all aspects today, what Britain will be "stripped clean" of is more than just in the field of medicine!

　　札记
    不对头
    美国报刊对于当前许多国家中发生的“反美情绪”警觉了起来。因为，“反美情绪”是在日渐强烈，而且非常普遍。
    美国“民族”杂志一篇专文列举了一个十分重要的事实和数字：“在过去十年中，有二十一个国家中的五十多个美国新闻署办事处挨到炸弹、被人烧掉，或者被人捣毁，其中大部分都是最近几年的事”。
    二十一个国家的人民，由于愤怒到了极点，于是对美国新闻署办事处采取了行动。这不是说明亿万人民对美国的帝国主义侵略政策憎恨万分又是什么呢？
    但是，“民族”杂志这篇专文的作者只是轻描淡写地回答了这个问题：“美国政策当中一定有什么不对头的地方”。这当然不是什么对头或不对头而是侵略他国人民还是尊重他国人民的问题。
    忧虑
    英国医学研究委员会秘书哈劳德·希姆斯窝夫爵士在皇家医生报酬委员会的一次会议上透露：英国许多著名的医学专家，特别是细菌学家、实验遗传学家和利用核能保健专家正在纷纷地被美国用“非常吸引人”的薪俸收买。为此，这位爵士忧心忡忡地警告说：“有朝一日我们将发现，英国在医学的基础部门方面会被剥得干干净净。”
    看来，这位英国爵士已经从亲身经历中尝到英美“相互依赖”和“好伙伴”政策的滋味了。美国一方面在一些所谓科学成就上对英国严格保密，一方面又不择手段地挖英国的墙脚。“大伙伴”美国的逻辑就是：“你的就是我的，我的还是我的。”
    由此可见，希姆斯窝夫爵士的忧虑是有根据的。不过，事情并不是到此为止。当美国正在从一切方面加紧挖大英帝国墙脚的今天，英国将“被剥得干干净净”的岂止于医学方面而已！
