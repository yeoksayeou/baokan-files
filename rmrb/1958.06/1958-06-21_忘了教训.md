    A Note
    
    Forgotten Lesson
    Recently, Britain hastily airlifted its 16th Parachute Brigade to Cyprus, attempting to suppress the people of Cyprus and follow the United States in invading Lebanon. This parachute brigade was the vanguard force in Britain's invasion of Egypt.
    Less than two years have passed, and Britain has completely forgotten the lessons of its failure in Egypt. "A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit" does not apply to imperialists. The rule of action for imperialists is: aggression, failure, re-aggression, re-failure..., until their demise.

    忘了教训
    最近英国把它的第十六伞兵旅匆匆空运到塞浦路斯，想要镇压塞浦路斯人民并追随美国侵略黎巴嫩。这个伞兵旅就是英国侵略埃及时的先锋部队。
    时间过去还不到两年，英国就把它在埃及失败的教训忘得干干净净了。吃一堑，长一智，这句话对帝国主义者总是不适用的。帝国主义者的行动规律是：侵略，失败，再侵略，再失败……，直至灭亡。
