    **Wormwood Solution:** Wormwood is a perennial wild plant. Cut the wormwood into small pieces and place it in a bucket, add two to three times the amount of water and soak for three to four hours. Then, wring out the wormwood and discard it, filtering the juice to remove any residue. This becomes the mother liquor. It can kill cotton aphids and red spiders. When using, add five liang of lime per jin of mother liquor, and dilute with six to ten jin of water for spraying.

    **Peach Leaf Solution:** Pick peach leaves, chop them finely, and place them in a bucket. Add one liang of lime per ten jin of leaves, and then add two to three times the amount of clear water, soaking for five hours. Wring out the soaked peach leaves and filter out the residue to obtain the mother liquor. It can prevent cotton aphids. When using, dilute each jin of mother liquor with eight to ten jin of water.

    **Bordeaux Mixture:** The preparation method is as follows: Use one jin of copper sulfate and one jin of quicklime lumps. First, dissolve one jin of copper sulfate in fifty jin of water in a small bucket. Then, dissolve one jin of quicklime lumps in fifty jin of water in another small bucket. After stirring evenly, filter out any residue. Then, slowly pour both buckets of solution simultaneously into a large bucket, stirring while pouring to ensure it is uniform, resulting in a sky-blue Bordeaux mixture. This agent can prevent cotton anthracnose, brown spot, ring spot, leaf spot, and damping-off; rice blast of rice; potato late blight; citrus scab and canker; tobacco anthracnose, etc. When using, spray it onto the crops with a sprayer.

    **Egg Oil Emulsion:** This is an effective agent for preventing aphids on cotton and other crops. The ingredients for preparation are: four liang of cotton oil (vegetable oil or sesame oil can also be used), two to three eggs (duck eggs can also be used), and thirty-five to forty jin of water. When preparing, first stir the eggs evenly, then slowly drip in the cotton oil, stirring continuously to ensure there is no floating oil on the surface, resulting in a sesame paste-like consistency. Then, add a small amount of water and stir. Gradually add water while stirring until the specified amount of water is added and mixed thoroughly. Because protein is prone to spoilage, this agent cannot be stored and must be used immediately after preparation.

    **Rosin Mixture:** This is an effective agent for preventing citrus scale insects, cotton red spiders and aphids, as well as sooty mold on trees. The preparation method is as follows: Use three jin of rosin (i.e., colophony), two jin of alkali powder (sodium carbonate), and ten jin of water. First, put the alkali powder in a pot and bring it to a boil. Then, slowly add the finely ground rosin, stirring while adding, until it is completely dissolved. Boil for a few more minutes and filter with warm gauze to obtain the original liquid mixture. When using, to prevent cotton red spiders, add forty to eighty jin of water per jin of the original liquid (the multiple of water added depends on the weather; add more water when the temperature is high; also add more water when the cotton seedlings are tender to avoid pesticide damage). To prevent citrus scale insects, add five to ten jin of water per jin of original liquid in autumn and winter and early spring, and fifteen to twenty jin of water in summer. When diluting, first dilute the original liquid with a small amount of hot water before adding cold water, otherwise it will not dissolve easily.

    几种农药制造方法
    苦艾液：苦艾是一种多年生的野生植物。把苦艾割下细细切碎放在桶内加二至三倍的水泡三至四小时，然后把苦艾拧干扔掉，汁水再滤去渣子，就成了母液。它能够毒杀棉花蚜虫和红蜘蛛。使用时，每斤母液加石灰五两，兑水六至十斤即可喷撒。
    桃树叶液：把桃树叶采下切细放入桶内，每十斤加石灰一两，再加二至三倍的清水泡五小时，把泡溶的桃叶拧干再滤去渣子，就成了母液。它能防治棉蚜虫，使用的时候每斤母液兑水八至十斤。
    波尔多液：配制方法是：用硫酸铜一斤，生石灰块一斤。先把一斤硫酸铜加五十斤水溶解在一个小桶里；再把一斤生石灰块加五十斤水溶解在另一小桶里，搅拌均匀后滤去残渣，然后把两桶溶液同时慢慢倒入一个大桶里，边倒边搅动，使其均匀，即成天蓝色波尔多液。这种药剂能防治棉花的炭疽病、褐斑病、轮纹病、叶斑病、立枯病；水稻的稻瘟病；马铃薯晚疫病；柑桔疮痂病、?疡病；烟草炭疽病等。使用时用喷雾器向作物上喷撒即可。
    蛋油乳剂：是防治棉花等作物蚜虫的有效药剂。配制的原料是：棉油四两（菜油、麻油也可以），鸡蛋二至三个（鸭蛋也可以），水三十五斤至四十斤。配制时，先把鸡蛋搅和均匀，然后把棉油慢慢滴入，随滴随搅，务使表面无浮油，成为芝麻酱状，再加入少量水分搅拌，然后逐渐加水，边搅边加，把定量的水加完搅匀即成。因蛋白质易于腐烂，此剂不可贮藏，配好后即须使用。
    松脂合剂：是防治柑桔介壳虫、棉花红蜘蛛和蚜虫以及树木烟霉病等有效药剂。配制方法是：用松脂（即松香）三斤，碱粉（碳酸钠）二斤，水十斤。先把碱粉放入锅内煮沸，再将磨细的松脂慢慢加入，边加边搅，等全部溶解后再煮几分钟，用温纱布过滤即成合剂原液。使用时，防治棉花红蜘蛛，每斤原液加水四十到八十斤（加水倍数，要看天气而定，气温高可多加；棉苗嫩，也要多加水，以免发生药害）；防治柑桔介壳虫，在秋冬两季和早春，每斤原液要加水五至十斤，夏季加水十五至二十斤。稀释时，要先用少量热水把原液冲淡再加入冷水，不然不易化开。
