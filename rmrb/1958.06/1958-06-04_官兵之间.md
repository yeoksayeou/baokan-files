　　Between Officers and Soldiers
    General and Soldier
    Zhou Hong
　　As usual, on Sunday, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit went to the "Evergreen Society" for voluntary labor again. After a period of intense work, the rest whistle blew, and the comrades immediately gathered together, talking and laughing. Only Zhao Zhongshi, the deputy squad leader of the sixth squad, sat silently under a tree. Suddenly, someone behind him said, "Hey, young man, what are you thinking about?" Zhao Zhongshi turned around and saw a stranger: a man in his forties, wearing a tattered blue cloth jacket, with a kind smile on his face.
    "What's your name?"
    "Zhao Zhongshi."
    "Which unit are you from?"
    "Second Platoon of the Guard Company. May I ask your name?"
    "Me? … My surname is Geng."
    "Geng? The same surname as our Political Commissar Geng?" "Oh! Our Political Commissar Geng, General Geng, ah…" Old Zhao's long sigh made Comrade Geng very strange, so he asked, "What's wrong with him?" Old Zhao glanced at him and said, "He… he is a bit bureaucratic!" Then, he told a story from the past:
    "One Saturday last summer, the sun was scorching. We had training in the morning and participated in voluntary labor in the afternoon, and we didn't finish until dusk. Everyone was thirsty and tired, as if all their energy had been used up, but First Platoon Leader Yan Jiaolie still asked me and Comrade Xu Shunrui to deliver coal briquettes to his wife. Xu Shunrui was a new recruit who had been digging soil too quickly that day and was exhausted. I said to the first platoon leader, 'Let's carry it together, Xu Shunrui is too tired.' The first platoon leader said, 'Can't you carry such a small amount of coal briquettes? I still have to carry the vegetable basket!' Seeing this situation, Xu Shunrui didn't say a word, picked up the coal basket and left. He was really too tired. He staggered as he walked. When he crossed a ditch, he fell down and couldn't get up, lying on the ground, his face pale, and white foam coming out of his mouth.
    Because of this, I wrote a letter to Political Commissar Geng. But what's the use! The political commissar wouldn't have time to read a soldier's letter."
    Comrade Geng glanced at Old Zhao, smiled gently, and said, "This is indeed bureaucracy."
　　A few days later, Zhao Zhongshi received a letter from Platoon Leader Yan. He was very surprised, and quickly read on: "Dear Deputy Squad Leader of the Second Squad, I was wrong before. Political Commissar Geng personally came to our company to check for remnants of warlordism, and I made a profound self-criticism. Political Commissar Geng asked me to talk to you, and now I am writing this letter to apologize to you..." After reading the letter, the feeling of excitement and gratitude prompted him to see Political Commissar Geng immediately.
    He ran to the political commissar's office in one breath. When he saw the general standing in front of him was the old Geng who had talked with him by the haystack, he blushed and didn't know what to say. Political Commissar Geng let him sit down and said to him kindly and sincerely, "Thank you for your criticism of me last time." As soon as Zhao Zhongshi heard this, he stood up and said, "Comrade Political Commissar, I was also wrong. I shouldn't have discussed the leaders behind their backs!"

    After watching the movie, it was already late at night, and a drizzle had started falling again. When I returned to the barracks, my cotton clothes were soaked. I went straight to the first platoon to find the political commissar before returning to my squad because he had told me to come back and study the work of the "experimental field" with him. Who knew I would miss him. Huh, didn't he say he was watching the door at home? Where did he go in the middle of the night?
    Political Commissar Tian has been really tired these days. A division leader, so old, and with a disabled body, lives with the soldiers in the squad every day, drilling and training with everyone in the wind and rain, covered in mud.
    I searched the whole company but couldn't find him and was hesitating. Among the people who came back successively after watching the movie, someone asked which platoon was on duty tonight, which reminded me.
    These days, Political Commissar Tian has always asked the squad leader to let him stand guard too, but the squad leader would definitely not agree, saying that he would never let a forty-year-old lieutenant colonel political commissar stand guard. Although he spent a lot of effort, no soldier was willing to hand over the post to him. Thinking of this, I decided to go to the post to find him.
    Along the winding mountain road, I walked towards the sea. From afar, I heard the roar of the sea waves accompanied by the rustling spring rain, and the pine trees in the mountains were also roaring. I had just climbed up the mountainside when a loud "Halt! Who goes there!" came. It was indeed the voice of Political Commissar Tian.
    I stepped forward and said, "Comrade Political Commissar, you can't do this!"
    "Hey, standing guard is our old job."
    "Isn't it the fourth platoon's shift tonight?" I asked.
    "I let him go to see the movie."
    "Okay, now I'll relieve you," I said, stepping forward to take the gun.
    "Why bother? Aren't I standing guard well, eh?"
    Seeing that there was really no way, I said, "Political Commissar, I have a suggestion for you. Your health is not good, this approach is not right."
    "Hey, comrade, you are too conservative!" He smiled rather disapprovingly and said, "What time is it now? Haven't you seen Chairman Mao going to this province today and that county tomorrow, running around agricultural cooperatives and neighborhood committees? Compared to Chairman Mao, I'm just a kid!"
    Then, he said meaningfully: "Comrade, the arduous war years are getting farther and farther away, and our days are not as difficult as they used to be; but the more in this kind of situation, the more we must not forget our glorious traditions. We must do what the soldiers do, and touch the unfamiliar things with our own hands, otherwise, how can we do a good job!"
    The night was deeper, and the spring rain was still falling, and his words hit my heart like raindrops... (Attached picture)

　　官兵之间
    将军和士兵
    周洪
    星期日，和往常一样，某部的官兵们，又到“长青社”义务劳动去了。经过一阵紧张的劳动，休息哨响了，同志们马上聚到一块，有说有笑地谈了起来。只有六班副赵钟实默默地坐在树下，突然身后有人对他说“嗳你这个小伙子总想什么？”赵钟实回头一看，是个素不相识的人：年岁四十开外，穿一件破蓝布褂子，嘴角挂着慈祥的笑容。
    “你叫什么名字？”
    “赵钟实。”
    “哪个单位的？”
    “警二连的，你尊姓？”
    “我？……我姓耿。”
    “耿？和我们的耿政委同姓吗？”“唉！我们的耿政委，耿将军呵……”老赵的长叹使耿同志很奇怪，便问：“他怎么？”老赵看了他一眼说：“他呀……有点官僚主义！”接着，他就讲起了一件往事：
    “去年夏天的一个星期六，太阳很毒。我们上午出课目，下午参加义务劳动，直到傍晚才收工。大家又渴又累，好像把全身的劲都用光了，可是一排长阎焦烈，还叫我和徐顺瑞同志给他老婆送煤球。徐顺瑞是个新战士，那天挖土挖得太急，累得够呛。我就对一排长说：‘咱俩抬吧，徐顺瑞太累了。’一排长说：“这点煤球还抬不动吗？我还要提菜篮哩！”瞧见这种情况，徐顺瑞二话没说，抬起煤筐就走。他真是太累了，走起路来直打晃，过一条沟的时候，一下就摔倒了，伏在地上爬不起来，脸煞白，嘴里直吐白沫子。
    为这事，我写了一封信给耿政委。可是有什么用！政委哪会有空看士兵的信。
    耿同志看了老赵一眼，温和地笑了笑说：“这确实是官僚主义。”
    几天之后，赵钟实接到一封信，是阎排长写来的。他很奇怪，
  忙看下去：“亲爱的二班副同志，以前我错了。耿政委亲自到我们连来检查了军阀残余，我作
  了深刻的检讨。耿政委叫我找你谈谈，现在我先给你写这封信向你道歉……。”看了信兴奋和感激的心情促使他想立刻去见耿政委。
    他一口气跑到政委办公室。当他看见站在他面前的这位将军，就是和他在草堆旁谈心的老耿时，他刷地红了脸，不知道说什么好。耿政委让他坐下亲切而又诚恳地对他说：“谢谢你上次对我的批评。”赵钟实一听，连忙站起来，说：“政委同志，我也错了，我不该背后议论首长！”
    春雨夜哨
    任斌武
    看完电影夜已经深了，不知什么时候又落起霏霏细雨。回到营房，浑身的棉衣淋得湿漉漉的，我没来得及回班，就直奔一排找政委去了。因为他曾告诉我回来和他一道研究“试验田”的工作。谁知我竟扑了个空。咦，他不是说在家看门的吗？深更半夜又到那里去了？
    田政委这几天真够累的了，一个师的首长，年龄那样大，又是个残废身体，整天和战士一起生活在班里，风里雨里跟大家一起出操练兵，滚得浑身是泥。
    我找遍了全连也没找到他，正在踌躇着。看完电影陆续回来的人中，不知是谁问起了今晚是那个排的岗，这下子可提醒了我。
    这些日子，田政委老是要求班长叫他也去站岗，班长当然不会答应，说什么也不会让一位四十多岁的上校政委站岗去。尽管他费了不少口舌，然而战士谁也不肯把岗交给他。想到这里，我决定到岗位上找去。
    沿着蜿蜒的山路，我朝海边走去，远远听到海浪伴着淅淅的春雨喧闹着，山间松涛也跟着呼呼地吼着，我刚刚登上山腰，就传来了一声宏亮的“口令！”不错，正是田政委的声音。
    我走上前去说：“政委同志，你这样不行啊！”
    “哎，站岗是咱的老行当了。”
    “今晚上不是四排的岗吗？”我问。
    “我让他看电影去了。”
    “好吧，现在我来换岗，”说着我就上前接枪。
    “何必呢，我不是站得很好嘛，嗯？”
    看看实在没有办法了，我说：“政委我给你提个意见，你身体这样不好，这种作法是不行的。”
    “哎，同志，你太保守罗！”他颇不以为然地笑了笑说，“这是什么时候啊，你没见毛主席老人家今天这个省，明天那个县，农业合作社、居民里弄跑这跑那的，比起主席来我还是个娃娃哩！”
    接着，他又意味深长地说：“同志，艰苦的战争年代愈去愈远了，咱们的日子也不像往日那样艰难了；但是愈在这样的情况下，咱们就更不能忘记咱的光荣传统，战士们作的事情咱们都要去做做，生疏的东西，就要亲手去摸摸，要不怎么能作好工作呢！”
    夜更深了，春雨还在刷刷地落着，他的话就像雨点一样打在我的心上……。（附图片）
