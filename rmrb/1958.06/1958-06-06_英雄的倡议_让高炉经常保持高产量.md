　　Heroic Initiative
　　Keep Blast Furnaces at High Production Regularly
　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th: All employees of the Iron Smelting Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant yesterday proposed a significant initiative to all brother iron smelting units across the country: to launch a competition to create new records for the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces over a longer period from June to December this year.
　　The initiative stated that from June to the end of the year, the iron smelting blast furnaces in this department should reduce the daily utilization coefficient to an average of 0.555 within seven months, which is 0.048 lower than the daily average utilization coefficient in May, which had the lowest utilization coefficient in the first five months of this year. Starting from June, the average daily pig iron production of blast furnaces should increase by 27.89% compared to the national plan, and 19.04% compared to the unit's leap forward plan; pig iron cost should decrease by 3.76% compared to the national plan, and 1.58% compared to the leap forward plan; and quality should reach 99.9%.
　　In order to guarantee the realization of the above plan, this department has decided to carry the rectification movement through to the end, widely and regularly carry out the technical innovation movement, improve equipment and labor organization, and adapt to the characteristics of continuous three-shift operation of blast furnaces; strengthen unified cooperation between the three shifts, and each person should realize five technical innovations and rationalization proposals this year.
　　In the first five months of this year, this department created thirty-one new records for the daily utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, and the average utilization coefficient on a ten-day and monthly basis also decreased significantly. In the past few days, after carefully studying the general line of socialist construction, all employees of this department believed that it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of tight and loose production and fluctuating output that appears in the pursuit of new daily production records, so they unanimously agreed to launch a competition to create new records for the average utilization coefficient over a longer period.

　　英雄的倡议
　　让高炉经常保持高产量
    据新华社太原5日电　太原钢铁厂炼铁部全体职工昨天向全国各兄弟炼铁单位提出一件具有重大意义的倡议：要在今年6月到12月期间开展创造较长时间的高炉平均利用系数新纪录的竞赛。
    倡议书中说，这个部的炼铁高炉从6月到年底，要在七个月内把每天的利用系数平均降低到零点五五五，比今年头五个月利用系数最低的5月份日平均利用系数降低零点零四八。从6月起，高炉平均日产生铁量要比国家计划提高27.89％，比本单位跃进计划提高19.04％；生铁成本比国家计划降低3.76％，比跃进计划降低1.58％；质量达到99.9％。
    为了保证以上计划的实现，这个部决定一定要把整风运动坚持到底，广泛、经常地开展技术革新运动，改进设备和劳动组织，适应高炉三班连续操作的特点；加强三班之间的统一协作，每人今年要实现五项技术革新和合理化建议。
    这个部在今年头五个月中，创造了三十一次高炉日利用系数新纪录，按旬按月的平均利用系数也有很大降低。这几天，这个部的全体职工认真地学习了社会主义建设总路线以后，认为必须防止为追求日产新纪录而出现的生产时紧时松、产量忽高忽低的现象，因此一致同意发起开展创造较长时期平均利用系数新纪录的竞赛。
