	Preparing for Winter Water Conservancy Construction in Advance
	The Practice of Xiangyang Prefecture in Early Planning and Early Action is Worth Promoting
	(Our Newspaper) News: Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, broke with convention and began various preparations for large-scale water conservancy projects this winter and next spring as early as late April. Currently, several tens of thousands of people throughout the prefecture are involved in this work. Specialized organizations have been established from the prefecture to the counties and many townships and communes to strengthen leadership.
	Xiangyang Prefecture achieved tremendous success in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. Both the amount of earth and stone work completed and the area of land benefited ranked first among the five prefectures in Hubei Province, and far exceeded the targets originally required by the prefecture's Second Five-Year Plan.
	In order to create conditions for the continued great leap forward in agriculture in the entire prefecture next year, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China seized the opportunity at the county party secretaries' meeting in late April, when the water conservancy campaign was basically over, to make arrangements and deployments for water conservancy construction. It demanded that water and drought disasters be basically eliminated in the entire prefecture this winter and next spring. According to preliminary planning, during the above-mentioned period, the entire prefecture will continue to build and renovate more than 100,000 water conservancy projects, and the earth and stone work task will increase by 40% compared with last winter and this spring, requiring the completion of 700 million cubic meters of earth and stone, so that the watermelon vine-style water irrigation network that has already been formed will continue to expand. After the completion of these projects, the paddy fields in the entire prefecture will increase from the current 7 million mu to 10 million mu, and the irrigated land will increase from the current 2 million mu to about 4 million mu, so that more than 80% of the original 17 million mu of cultivated land will become paddy fields and irrigated land; the drought resistance capacity of the original paddy fields and irrigated land will also be further strengthened. At the same time, tens of thousands of hydraulic processing projects and hundreds of small hydropower stations will also be built. In order to enable early preparation for spring plowing and avoid excessive occupation of labor by water conservancy projects, the Prefectural Committee requires that medium and small-scale water conservancy projects in various counties be completed this winter, and the conversion of dry land to paddy fields should resolutely implement the principle of "building water conservancy while converting fields," and 75% of the field conversion plan should be completed this winter. Therefore, preparations for water conservancy projects must be made early and construction must start early.
	Since May, specialized organizations headed by the Prefectural Party Secretary, County Party Secretaries, or County Heads have been established from the prefecture to the counties to lead the preparatory work for large-scale water conservancy projects. So far, surveying, design, and the formulation of construction plans have generally begun in various counties. Each county has established a specialized surveying and design team, and some projects have completed surveying and are now starting design. In terms of construction materials, in addition to obtaining materials locally as much as possible and using substitutes without affecting quality, various counties will establish a large number of low-grade small cement plants, most of which have already begun construction. In addition, the counties are also actively preparing to build gunpowder factories and continue to promote the experience of advanced water conservancy tool reforms to meet the needs of large-scale construction. Various counties have also generally established year-round construction teams. These construction teams are starting construction now on some jobs that require a longer time due to the limitation of small working surfaces, such as cleaning foundations, quarrying stone, and renovating transportation lines. Work related to training technical personnel, arranging labor for large-scale construction, dividing work sections, and organizing collaboration will also begin successively soon. It is expected that most projects can start in August, and some projects can start in July.
	Party committees and governments at all levels in Xiangyang Prefecture attach great importance to the preparatory work for large-scale water conservancy projects, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses is also very high. "Do not fight unprepared battles" is their slogan. In carrying out various preparatory work, all localities have paid attention to educating cadres and the masses to overcome conservative ideas and establish confidence in victory by summarizing, visiting, and mobilizing the masses to conduct extensive airing of views, great contending, and great debates.

### 提前准备今冬水利建设  襄阳专区早规划早动手的做法值得提倡

    提前准备今冬水利建设
    襄阳专区早规划早动手的做法值得提倡
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳专区打破了常规，从四月下旬起即开始了今冬明春大兴水利的各项准备工作。目前，全专区投入这一工作的已有好几万人，从专区到各县以及许多乡、社，都建立了专门机构以加强领导。
    襄阳专区去冬今春在水利建设方面获得了巨大的成就，无论从完成的土石方量和受益的土地面积来看，都居湖北省五个专区之冠，并远远超过了全专区原订第二个五年计划要求的指标。
    为了给明年全专区农业继续大跃进创造条件，中共襄阳地委在四月下旬水利运动基本结束时，即抓住时机在县委书记会上对水利建设作了安排和部署，要求在今冬明春使全专区基本消灭水旱灾害。据初步规划，在上述时期内，全专区将继续新修和整修水利工程达十万处以上，土石方任务将比去冬今春增加40％，要完成土、石方七亿公方，使已经形成的西瓜秧式的水利灌溉网继续扩大。这些工程完成后，全专区水田将由现在的七百万亩增加到一千万亩，水浇地由现有的二百万亩增加到约四百万亩，使原有的一千七百万亩耕地80％以上都成为水田和水浇地；原有水田和水浇地的抗旱能力也将随着进一步加强。同时，还将兴建上万个水力加工工程和几百个小型水电站。为了使明春的备耕工作能够及早地进行，不致因水利工程占用劳动力过多而受到影响，地委要求各县的中、小型水利工程要在今冬全部完成，旱地改水田应坚决贯彻“边修水利边改田”的方针，在今冬要完成改田计划的75％。因此，对水利工程必须早准备、早兴工。
    5月以来从专区到各县都先后建立了以地委书记、县委书记或县长为首的专门机构，来领导大兴水利的准备工作。到目前为止，各县的勘测设计和制订施工计划的工作已经普遍开始，县县都建立了专门的勘测设计队伍，有一部分工程已经完成勘测，正着手进行设计。在施工器材方面，除尽可能地就地取材和在不影响质量的条件下采用代用品外，各县都将建立大批的低标号小型水泥厂，其中绝大部分县现已开始着手建立。此外，各县还在积极筹建火药厂和继续推广先进的改革水利工具的经验，以适应大规模施工的需要。各县还普遍建立了常年施工队。这种施工队正把一些受工作面小的限制而需时较长的工作，像清理基础、开石方和整修运输线路等，从现在起就提前开始施工。有关培训技术力量，安排大规模施工的劳动力，以及划分工段和组织协作等工作，也将在不久后陆续开始。预计到八月份，大部分工程即可开工，部分工程在7月份就可开工。
    襄阳专区各级党委和政府对大兴水利的准备工作都极为重视，广大群众的积极性也很高。“不打无准备的仗”就是他们的口号。在进行各项准备工作时，各地都注意了通过总结、参观、发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，教育干部和群众克服保守思想，树立胜利信心。
