The Great Yuan Dynasty Dramatist Warrior Guan Hanqing
Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Tian Han

I.

The Chinese people love drama. The budding stage of drama originated very early in China, and by the Sui and Tang Dynasties, significant development could already be traced. From the Tang to the Song Dynasties, dramatic forms focusing on language and action, as well as dance forms, were enriched and enhanced. In the Yuan Dynasty, a brilliant flower of drama combining *ke* (action), *bai* (language), and *chang* (singing and dancing) finally blossomed – the Yuan Zaju. From then on, China had a relatively complete dramatic form of representation, laying the foundation for a tradition of realistic dramatic literature. Guan Hanqing was one of the main founders of this great tradition!

The records of Guan Hanqing that have been passed down are so few. For such a great playwright, you cannot find his name in the *Yuan History: Biographies of Literary Figures*. Even the *Yuan History: Arts and Literature* did not acknowledge "zaju," this brilliant artistic form representing the Yuan Dynasty. This fully demonstrates that although feudal scholar-officials loved to watch dramas, they greatly despised this literary form and its authors and performers. Thus, we still have different estimations of Guan Hanqing's birth and death dates. He was likely born in the 1220s, and died at the end of that century or the beginning of the 14th century. It is possible that he lived a long life. The peak of his creative activity began about 700 years ago, from the early period when Kublai Khan destroyed the Southern Song and established the Yuan Dynasty, until the Yuanzhen and Dade periods of Yuan Chengzong. He was from Dadu (Beijing). Nineteen of the early zaju writers were from Dadu, indicating that Beijing was once the birthplace of zaju art. He migrated to Dadu from Jie Prefecture, Shanxi, and it is said that he lived in Anguo County, Hebei Province, for some time. In the Yuan Dynasty, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi were called "Abdominal areas," and transportation was frequent, which makes this entirely possible.

According to records such as "Register of Ghosts," he and the outstanding zaju writer Yang Xianzhi were intimate friends who critiqued and revised each other's works. The playwrights Fei Junxiang and Liang Jinzhi were also his friends. Liang Jinzhi was a famous doctor and a family friend of Guan Hanqing. Guan Hanqing may also have been a doctor, although he playfully teased doctors in "Dou E's Injustice," saying: "Practicing medicine requires deliberation, prescribing medicine follows the *Materia Medica*. The dead cannot be revived, and the living are killed by medicine." Wang Shifu may also have been his contemporary, and it is said that they jointly created "Romance of the Western Chamber." Reading Guan Hanqing's poems about "Sixteen Things of Cui Zhang" in "Collection of Pearl-like Ballads," one will find that many sentences in the sixteen poems from "Cause of Salvation Temple" to "Reunion of Husband and Wife" are the same as the lyrics in "Romance of the Western Chamber," so it can be seen that this is not without basis.

Yuan Dynasty zaju actors were mainly courtesans in the Jiaofang. Zhu Lianxiu "combined various skills in one woman" and was "unparalleled" in performing zaju at the time. It was natural for Guan Hanqing to be friendly with her. (He gave Zhu Lianxiu [Nanyu Yizhihua].)

Guan Hanqing went to Hangzhou not long after the fall of the Southern Song Dynasty and wrote about "Hangzhou Scenery." In addition, he also went to Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other places.

Guan Hanqing's "writing about his feelings" contains the sentence "Zhuang Sheng would also sigh at this, moved by the times, I tie up my hair, sitting still like a monk," indicating that his wife died relatively early.

This is roughly what we can understand about his life and traces.

Although Guan Hanqing was not valued by feudal scholar-officials, he deeply penetrated the lower levels of society, especially the Jiaofang and the goulan (theaters), which were oppressed and trampled upon at the time. He was a highly respected "talent of the book society," and Jia Zhongming called him "leader of the pear garden," "chief editor (referring to editing scripts)," and "head of the zaju troupe." Yuan zaju was not created by him alone, but undoubtedly he was the most powerful pioneer in advancing zaju art to a higher stage.

II.

In the many zaju left by Guan Hanqing, whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, one can invariably hear the sound of him clashing with the dark forces of the time. Guan Hanqing always stood on the side of the oppressed people, opening fire on the rulers who oppressed the people. He was not a literati who sought "comments and care from princes and lords, to suit their needs and instructions," but rather a severe critic, exposer, and protester of the Mongol slave-owning aristocracy's rule!

First, he opened fire on the unjust and reactionary wars that cruelly massacred the people and destroyed their economy and culture. In addition to some promotion of cultural exchange and commercial transportation in the world, the Mongol slave-owning aristocracy's war of aggression destroyed the production and culture of the invaded nations, endangering the safety of people's lives and devastating the lives of the broad masses of the people. The populations of the Jin and Song Dynasties originally totaled 100 million, but were slaughtered to only 50 million by the Yuan Dynasty. It was truly as Guan Hanqing lamented in "A Maiden's Lament in the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion," "Bones scattered in the Central Plains like tangled hemp"! In this play, Guan Hanqing also profoundly wrote about the suffering of the people who experienced the pain of separation and exile under the iron hooves of the Mongol nobles. As in the first act: "Clearly, the wind and rain urge people to leave their homeland, taking a step and sighing. Two lines of sorrowful tears hang on the face, a drop of rain interspersed with a line of mournful tears, a gust of wind accompanied by a long sigh... "

Although this play mainly writes about the love between Wang Ruilan and Jiang Shilong, it is actually full of powerful accusations against unjust wars. "When dragons fight, fish get hurt" is such a poignant and vivid metaphor!

After the Mongol slave-owning aristocracy invaded the Central Plains, they established a brutal and backward slave system and semi-slave system on the basis of Chinese feudalism. The law stipulated that slaves who beat or verbally abused their masters or killed or injured adulterers of the master would be executed; slaves who accused their masters were guilty. Conversely, masters had full power over the lives and deaths of their slaves. Guan Hanqing could not have been unaffected by this. Guan Hanqing fiercely seized on the irreconcilable opposition of the two classes in feudal society to make accusations. In "Bao Zheng Wisely Executes Lu Zhai Lang," he highlighted the opposition between the so-called "powerful and influential families" and the laboring people. The so-called "powerful and influential families" were synonymous with those privileged classes of the Mongol Dynasty who "could kill people without paying for their lives." They were, of course, landlords, but their power far exceeded that of ordinary landlords. Although this play is set in the Northern Song Dynasty, it actually refers to the Yuan Dynasty.

Guan Hanqing was not only good at exposing the contradictions between oppressors and the oppressed, but also good at vigorously encouraging the rebellious emotions of the oppressed. He praised all those who dared to fight the enemy, and satirized all those who succumbed to the enemy. In a word, he always boosted the spirit of the oppressed and destroyed the prestige of the oppressors!

Take a look at "Bao Zheng Thrice Investigates the Butterfly Dream." In this play, he also wrote about a "powerful and influential family" like Lu Zhai Lang called Ge Biao, who was also known as a "royal relative," whose power can be imagined. He claimed, "I can kill people without paying for their lives." When Old Man Wang bumped into his horse's head, he beat him to death. According to Yuan Dynasty rules, the victim's family could only "swallow their anger." But Guan Hanqing had Granny Wang lead her three sons and encounter Ge Biao on the long street. After an argument, the three sons also beat Ge Biao to death. This caused no small trouble! But Granny Wang angrily pointed to Ge Biao's corpse and said:

"Thinking back then, you didn't think thrice. Retribution always comes, Heaven's retribution is impartial. You pretended to be a hero on the long street, who would have thought you would lie in a pool of blood, just like a general shot with a poisoned arrow, it's like when he shot someone!"

This resolute mother did not seem to regret it at all, and she encouraged her sons, saying:

"I didn't expect this disaster to come from the sky. You beat him to death in a pool of blood. You ought to avenge your father. Even if you are sentenced to death and go to the underworld, you will still be known as filial sons."

"Thinking back then, it was a last resort. It's just that if the crime is punishable, we will report to the Emperor, and at most one person will be executed. It will not cut off the Wang family's ancestral line, and it will not lead to the extermination of our entire family."

In order to encourage the spirit of "fighting back," the playwright not only did not let the Wang family be "exterminated," but even had Bao Zheng return the small Wang San, who was to be executed, to her.

This is how Guan Hanqing cheered for those who dared to fight back and dared to "avenge their father"! Even if the opponent was a "powerful and influential family," and even a "member of the imperial family, a golden branch and jade leaf."

Guan Hanqing not only encouraged the oppressed to fight and satirized those who succumbed, but he also further pointed out that those who struggle unyieldingly will surely achieve victory. He did not just shout slogans empty-handedly. He profoundly told us that as long as you are not intimidated by the enemy, you will find that even the most powerful enemy has weaknesses and can be defeated. Life and wisdom are precisely on the side of the oppressed. Therefore, ultimate victory is also on the side of the oppressed.

Take a look at "Zhao Pan'er Rescues from the Dust." Zhou She, the son of Magistrate Zhou of Zhengzhou, is a veteran of the "meat and wine scene for thirty years, spending extravagantly for twenty years." Zhao Pan'er is determined to go to Zhengzhou to rescue Song Yinzhang, who is being beaten and scolded, from Zhou She's hands. Song Yinzhang's mother is a little worried. But Zhao Pan'er believes in her own strength, saying: "It's not that I'm boasting, how can he escape my grip?" Because she is clever and resourceful, grasps the enemy's weaknesses, and makes thorough preparations, she finally achieves her goal without getting implicated herself.

Take another look at "Mid-Autumn Fish Slice at the Gazing River Pavilion." Yang Yanei, from the same "powerful and influential family," obtains a gold medal and tiger tally from the emperor to behead Bai Shizhong, the Prefect of Changsha, and seize the beautiful Tan Ji'er as his concubine because of his private accusations. As a result, this Tan Ji'er, who comes from humble origins but is extremely talented, dares to disguise herself as a fisherwoman. On the Mid-Autumn Festival night, she goes to the Gazing River Pavilion under the guise of selling carp to meet with Yang Yanei.

Because she sees through that the oppressors are so despicable and incompetent, Tan Ji'er teases Yang Yanei to her heart's content at the "Gazing River Pavilion," successfully tricking him out of the gold medal and tiger tally, and shattering Yang Yanei's sinister plot.

Guan Hanqing also could not suppress his anger at the corruption system. Yuan Dynasty officials were initially not given salaries, and were simply allowed to exploit the people. Therefore, the Taowu Magistrate in "Dou E's Injustice" kowtows to those who come to sue, saying: "Those who come to sue are my food and clothing parents." Therefore, Guan Hanqing proposed the slogan "Kill all the corrupt officials... sharing the worries of one person and eliminating harm for the people" in the fourth act of "Dou E's Injustice."

The playwright also touched on this issue in the play "Mother Chen Teaches Her Son in the Hall of Honors." Mother Chen taught her three sons, all of whom excelled in the imperial examinations. The third son, Liangzuo, passed through Jinzhou, Sichuan, on his way home, and the local elders gave him a piece of "baby brocade," worth a thousand strings of cash. Liangzuo gave it to his mother to make clothes. Mother Chen was furious, saying: "Before my unworthy son has even become an official, he has already accepted the wealth of the people," and ordered her youngest son to lie down and receive a beating with a cane, which knocked her top-ranking son's "goldfish badge" to the ground. At that time, corruption was rampant in the court, and Mother Chen's cane was hitting every corrupt official.

Guan Hanqing also opposed the child bride system, usurious exploitation, and the patriarchal system, etc. In "Dou E's Injustice," he even borrowed the mouth of that unfortunate young widow to accuse the heavens and earth of not distinguishing between good and bad, and wrongly judging the wise and foolish. She said:

"...The virtuous suffer poverty and have short lives, while the wicked enjoy wealth and longevity. Heaven, you are afraid of the strong and bully the weak, and you push the boat along with the current. Earth, you cannot distinguish between good and bad, it's hard to be the Earth. Heaven, you wrongly judge the wise and foolish, you wrongly act as Heaven!..."

III.

In Guan Hanqing's works, realism and romanticism are well combined. When his Dou E is executed, she makes three vows: first, when the knife falls, the blood must spray onto the white banner and not touch the ground; second, it must snow in June to cover her corpse; and third, "this Chu Prefecture will experience a three-year drought." These are all impossible, but the author makes these impossible things all come true. The unyielding Dou E does not spare her enemies even after becoming a ghost. She "cries every day while guarding the Gazing Hometown Terrace, anxiously waiting for her enemies," until she meets and persuades her father, Dou Tianzhang, and she can finally take revenge. These impossible plots in "Dou E's Injustice" represent the angry emotions and wishes of the people at the time.

Guan Hanqing's romanticism is also reflected in the "Bao Zheng Thrice Investigates the Butterfly Dream" mentioned earlier. This play was once carelessly classified by our historians, along with Ma Zhiyuan's "Yellow Millet Dream" and Yue Bochuan's "Li Tieguai," as works that "express a world-weary mood and promote Taoism." (See Lü Zhenyu: "A Concise General History of China," page 524.) In fact, Bao Zheng's "Butterfly Dream" has nothing in common with Zhuang Zhou's "Butterfly Dream." There is not the slightest world-weary thought or promotion of Taoism. Guan Hanqing wrote that this model and ideal official of the people suddenly felt sleepy after hearing a case and rested on the desk. In his nap, he had such a dream:

The flowers are brilliant, the spring scenery is harmonious, a spider web is formed on the pavilion, a butterfly flies in among the flowers and hits the web; Bao Zheng is secretly saddened, the butterfly was once beaten and flown away; don't say that people have life and death, even insects have disasters. Ah! ... A large butterfly flies in and rescues this butterfly. Ah, another butterfly flies in and hits the web, that big butterfly will definitely come to rescue it. How strange! That big butterfly flies only in the flowers two or three times, without saving the small butterfly, pretending to fly away. The sages say, "Compassion is inherent in all people," but you don't save it; let me save it!

After Bao Zheng wakes up from his dream, he encounters a case sent by Zhongmou County about the Wang brothers killing Ge Biao to avenge their father. After several inquiries, the three loving brothers argued over who would confess, but only one person needed to pay with their life. Bao Zheng asked Wang Da to pay, and Wang's mother said, "My eldest son is filial, who will support me if he is killed?" Bao Zheng asked Wang Er to pay, and Wang's mother said, "The second child is good at doing business..." So Wang San brought shackles himself, saying, "My elder and second brothers will not pay with their lives, I see that it will be me, might as well do a favor early." Bao Gong said to Wang's mother, "Shall we ask Wang San to pay with his life?" Wang's mother said, "Isn't it said that 'the youngest suffers when three people go together,' then let him pay with his life." Bao Gong thought, "These eldest and second sons must be her own, and the third son may have been adopted or a stepchild, so she doesn't feel sorry at all." When he questioned the Wang mother again, who knew that it was exactly the opposite, this Wang San was her own son. She said, "If I ask the son of the previous wife to pay with his life, wouldn't it seem like I am a vicious stepmother?" Bao Zheng was deeply moved by these words, and he remembered the events of his dream, saying: "Three insects are hurt by spider silk, they are the same as the official case of mother and son. The stepmother abandons her own son three times, it corresponds to the butterfly dream I had at noon." So he finally found a way to have Zhao Wanlu replace Wang San, and let a living Wang San return to the arms of this virtuous mother.

In this play, Guan Hanqing portrays Bao Zheng, who is known as impartial and unselfish and whose smile clears the Yellow River, as an affectionate old man who cannot bear to see a small butterfly caught in a spider web, so it is entirely possible for him to help the kind Wang family, who are oppressed by the "powerful and influential families," escape their tragic fate. Some people say that there is "fatalism" here. What "fatalism" is there? There is the people's fantasy. A kind fantasy is a positive romanticism.

Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of the entire history of literature and advocated that our literature should be a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. I believe that in terms of dramatic literature, many of Guan Hanqing's works are good examples of the combination of realism and romanticism.

IV.

Just as people call Du Fu a "poet historian," people can also see Yuan Dynasty society from Guan Hanqing's works. Even though Guan Hanqing does not directly write about Yuan Dynasty society, Han Bangqi (Zi Yuanlu, Jinshi in the Zhengde era) of the Ming Dynasty once compared Guan Hanqing to the historian Sima Qian. This is very appropriate. Guan Hanqing is a good mirror of the politics and society of the Yuan Dynasty. He reflected the darkness and corruption of the time with the same depressed and upright feelings as Sima Qian, and also showed the noble virtues displayed by the oppressed Han and Southern people in their struggle against the darkness and corruption. Playwrights in the mid- and late Yuan Dynasty emphasized textual skills and neglected the new and sharp ideological content that was its soul, so Yuan opera gradually lost its initial brilliance.

The new thing that was zaju, especially since it was born from the people and represented the people's anger, was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the oppressed people, but the scholar-officials who followed the ruling class always underestimated it. It was not until after the Ming Dynasty, and even until the late Qing Dynasty, that its amazing talent and beauty were highly valued by some more insightful scholars. But Yuan opera is clearly not only "the most natural literature," but also "the most democratic literature," and "the literature richest in popular appeal." Only in the era of the people can the true value of this fighting literature and its writers be truly recognized. Guan Hanqing, who was not valued by the scholar-officials seven hundred years ago and constantly suffered oppression from the rulers, is unanimously respected by the people of the whole country today, seven hundred years later, and even progressive people all over the world commemorate him as a cultural figure who has made contributions. The vast majority of his works are simultaneously performed by more than a thousand professional theater troupes in various forms of Kunqu Opera, Beijing Opera, local opera, spoken drama, and new opera all over the country. This is a glorious encounter for Chinese playwrights that has never happened before. This is truly worthy of Guan Hanqing and all Yuan Dynasty zaju writers smiling from the grave, if they were conscious.

At the same time, this is also truly worthy of our pride. As early as seven centuries ago, we had such a great realist writer, who learned carefully and created boldly with the people and artists. He brought forth the new from the old, valued the present over the past. He skillfully and bravely used the art of historical drama, tragedy, and comedy in a variety of forms to serve the oppressed people of the time. He opened up a brilliant path that combines high political thought with artistic form, and combines realism with romanticism!

Seven hundred years ago, he had already sounded the loud call to oppose wars of aggression and defend peace!

Around the time of our conference, progressive people all over the world are commemorating Guan Hanqing with the same enthusiasm, re-evaluating his creative activities and their contribution to mankind. Countries like the Soviet Union have even performed his masterpiece "Dou E's Injustice." This specifically illustrates that Guan Hanqing does not only belong to the Chinese people, he belongs to all progressive humanity. As Chinese literary and art workers, we have an obligation to establish our own "Guan Studies," just like the "Shakespeare Studies" in Europe. It can be said that our Marxist research on Guan Hanqing is still in its initial stage. We should thoroughly eliminate the metaphysical methodology of the bourgeoisie, and study Guan Hanqing more correctly and more carefully, so that the hidden virtues of this great playwright and his outstanding contemporary writers can be brought into greater play, to contribute to the Chinese people and contribute to the world.

Under the illumination of communist ideology, let us move forward in Guan Hanqing's great footsteps. Let a great people's China produce outstanding dramatic literature that far surpasses the era of Yuan opera. Let an incomparably magnificent Chinese people's theater scene produce countless Guan Hanqings, and cultivate more and more beautiful dramatic flowers for the benefit of the people!

专栏：

    伟大的元代戏剧战士关汉卿
    中国戏剧家协会主席　田汉
    一
    中国人民是热爱戏剧的。萌芽状态的戏剧在中国起源甚早，到隋唐时代已经可以找到显著的发展脉络；由唐到宋以语言动作为主的戏剧形式和歌舞形式都有所丰富与提高；到了元代终于开出科（动作）、白（语言）、唱（歌舞）相结合的灿烂的戏剧花朵——元杂剧。从这之后，中国才有较完备的代言体的戏剧形式，才奠定了现实主义戏剧文学传统，而关汉卿正是这一伟大传统的主要奠基人之一！
    关于关汉卿的记载，流传下来的是如此之少，像他这样一位大剧作家，你不能从元史文苑传找到他的名字，甚至元史艺文志也没有理会到“杂剧”这一代表元代的辉煌的文艺形式。这充分说明了封建士大夫虽也爱看戏剧，却十分轻视这种文体和它的作者与艺人的。这样，我们对于关汉卿生卒年月至今有不同的估计。他大约生于十三世纪的二十年代。死在这个世纪的末年或十四世纪初年，可能他是很长寿的。他的创作活动的旺盛期约从距今七百年前开始，就是忽必烈汗灭了南宋，建立元朝统治的初期，直到元成宗元贞、大德之间。他是大都（北京）人，初期杂剧的作家有十九位是大都人，可知北京曾经是杂剧艺术的发祥之地。他是由山西解州流寓大都的，据传在河北省安国县住过一些时候。元代河北、山东、山西称为“腹里”，交通频繁，这完全是可能的。
    据“录鬼簿”等的记载，他跟同代优秀的杂剧家杨显之是莫逆的朋友，互相评改作品。剧作家费君祥和梁进之也是他的好友，梁进之是名医，跟关汉卿世交，关汉卿可能也是一位医生，虽说他在“窦娥冤”里还诮皮过医生，说：“行医有斟酌，下药依本草。死的医不活，活的医死了。”王实甫也可能是他的同时人，传说他们共同创作了“西厢记”。读过“乐府群珠”所载关汉卿咏“崔张十六事”的，会发现它从“普救因缘”到“夫妇团圆”十六首中有很多句子是跟“西厢记”的曲词相同的，就可知此说不是没有根据。
    元代杂剧演员主要是教坊歌妓，朱廉秀“以一女子众艺兼并”，表演杂剧为当时“独步”，关汉卿曾和她相友好是很自然的。（他赠过朱廉秀〔南吕一枝花〕。）
    关汉卿在南宋亡后不久到过杭州，咏过“杭州景”，此外他还到过开封，洛阳等地。
    关汉卿“写怀”的词有“庄生遇此也宜嗟，感时思结发，兀坐似僧家”的句子，可知他的妻死得较早。
    我们所能了解的关于他的生平踪迹大致如此。
    关汉卿虽不见重于封建士大夫，但他深入当时被压迫作践的社会下层，特别是教坊，勾阑（戏园子）。他是一位声望很高的“书会才人”，贾仲名称他为“梨园领袖”，“编修（指编改剧本）帅首”，“杂剧班头”。元杂剧不会是他一个人创造的，但无疑地他是把杂剧艺术推进到较高阶段的最有力的先驱者。
    二
    在关汉卿留下的许多杂剧中，不管是悲剧也好，喜剧也好，无例外地可以听到他和当时黑暗势力兵铁相击的声音。关汉卿总是站在被压迫的人民一边，向压迫人民的统治者开火。他不是什么希求王公们“品题照顾，适合他们的需要和指示”的文士，他恰恰是蒙古奴隶主贵族统治的严峻的批评者、揭发者、抗议者！
    首先，他向残酷地屠杀人民，破坏人民经济文化的不义的反动的战争开火。蒙古奴隶主贵族发动的侵略战争除了对世界文化交流，商业交通有若干促进作用外，它破坏被侵略民族的生产和文化，危害人民生活安全，摧残了广大人民生命。金宋两国原达一万万的人口到了元朝屠杀得只剩五千万。那真是关汉卿在“闺怨佳人拜月亭”剧里慨叹的“白骨中原如乱麻”！关汉卿在这个剧里还深刻地写出了当时人民在蒙古贵族铁蹄下所经历的乱离流亡之苦。如第一折：“分明是风雨催人辞故国，行一步，一叹息。两行愁泪脸边垂，一点雨间一行凄惶泪，一阵风对一声长吁气。……”
    这个剧本虽主要写王瑞兰和蒋世隆的恋爱，实际上充满对不义战争的有力控诉。“龙斗来鱼伤”是多么痛切的形象的比喻啊！
    蒙古奴隶主贵族侵入中原后，在中国封建制上建立残暴落后的奴隶制、半奴隶制的统治，法律规定奴婢打骂主人或杀伤奸犯主人处死刑；奴婢告主人有罪。反之，主人对奴婢有生杀全权。关汉卿对此不可能无所感受。关汉卿狠狠地抓住了封建社会两个阶级的不调和的对立来进行控诉。在“包待制智斩鲁斋郎”中他突出了所谓“权豪势要之家”与劳动人民的对立。所谓“权豪势要之家”是蒙古王朝那些“杀人不偿命”的特权阶级的代名词，他们当然是地主，但权势之大又远远超过一般地主。这戏虽以北宋做背景，实际指的元朝。
    关汉卿还不止善于揭发压迫者和被压迫者之间的矛盾，而且善于极力鼓舞被压迫者的反抗情绪。对于一切敢于跟敌人斗争的他都加以歌颂；对于向敌人屈服的他都加以讽刺。一句话，他总是长被压迫者的意气，灭压迫者的威风！
    看一看“包待制三勘蝴蝶梦”吧。在这个戏里，他也写了一个跟鲁斋郎一样的“权豪势要之家”叫葛彪，他又是被称为“皇亲”的，其权势可想了。他自称“我打死人不偿命”。王老汉撞了他的马头就把他给打死了。按元代规矩，受害者的家属也只能“忍气吞声吧。”但是关汉卿让王婆婆领着三个儿子在长街上遇着葛彪，争吵之下，三个儿子也把葛彪给打死了。这祸闯得不小！但王婆婆愤怒地指着葛彪尸首说：
    “想当时，你可也不三思。这一还一报从来是，想皇天报应不容私。则道你长街上装好汉，谁想你血泊内也停尸，正是将军着痛箭，还似射人时！”
    这位刚毅的母亲看起来也不怎么后悔，她鼓励她儿子们说：
    “不想这场祸从天至。你又打得来血泊停尸。你为亲爷雪恨合当是。便当刑死赴阴司，也落得个孝顺名儿。”
    “想当时也是不得已而为之。止不过罪若当刑奏过圣旨，不过是一人处死，须断不了王家宗祀，且不致灭门绝户了俺一家儿。”
    剧作家为了鼓舞“还手”精神，岂止没有让王家“灭门绝户”，甚至还让包待制把当刑的小王三也还给她了。
    关汉卿就是这样替敢于还手，敢于“为亲爷雪恨”的人喝彩！尽管对手是“权豪势要之家”，而且是“国戚皇亲，金枝玉叶。”
    关汉卿也不止是鼓舞被压迫者斗争，对屈服者加以讽刺，他还进一步指出斗争不屈便一定会得到胜利。他不只是空口地叫嚷，他是深刻地告诉我们，只要你不被敌人唬倒，你会发现再强大的敌人也存在弱点，也可以打倒，充满生命力和智慧的恰恰是在被压迫者这一边。因而最终胜利也在被压迫者这一边。
    就看看“赵盼儿风月救风尘”吧。郑州周同知的儿子周舍是一位“酒肉场中三十载，花星整照二十年”的惯家。赵盼儿发心要去郑州从周舍手里救出挨打受骂的宋引章。宋引章的娘有些担心。但赵盼儿相信自己力量，说：“不是我说大口，怎出我烟花手？”由于她聪明机智掌握了敌人的弱点，又做了周到的准备，终于达到了目的，而她自己没有受牵累。
    再看“望江亭中秋切鱠旦”吧。同一“权豪势要”的杨衙内，由于他的挟私诬告，从皇帝那里取得金牌虎符来标长沙太守白士中的首级，夺取美丽的谭记儿为妾，结果这位出身寒微而才智纵横的谭记儿竟敢扮做渔妇，在中秋月夜，到望江亭以卖鲤鱼为名去会见那杨衙内。
    由于她看透了压迫者是那样卑鄙无能，谭记儿在“望江亭”上把杨衙内尽情播弄，胜利地骗得了金牌虎符，粉碎了杨衙内的阴谋毒计。
    关汉卿也不能制止他对贪污制度的愤怒。元代官吏起先不给薪俸，就是任他们剥削人民。所以“窦娥冤”里的檮杌太守向告状的叩头，说：“但来告状的就是我的衣食父母。”所以关汉卿在“窦娥冤”第四折，提出了“把滥官污吏都杀坏，……与一人分忧，万民除害”的口号。
    剧作者在“状元堂陈母教子”剧中也接触了这个问题，陈母教三个儿子都大魁天下。第三子良佐回家路经四川锦州，当地父老送了他一匹“孩儿锦”，价值千贯，良佐送给他的娘做衣服穿。陈母大怒说：“辱子未曾为官，可早先受民财”，叫她小儿子躺下受杖，直打的她状元儿子“金鱼落地”。当时贪污满朝，陈母的拐杖是打在每一个滥官污吏的身上的。
    关汉卿也反对过童养媳制度，高利贷剥削，以及家长制等等。他在“窦娥冤”中甚至借那位不幸的青年寡妇的嘴里，控诉到不分好歹，错勘贤愚的天地。她说：
    “……有德的受贫穷更命短，造恶的享富贵又寿延。天也，做得个怕硬欺软，不想天地也顺水推船：地也，你不分好歹难为地，天也，你错勘贤愚枉做天！……”

    在关汉卿的作品中现实主义与浪漫主义有很好的结合。他的窦娥临刑的时候立下三个誓愿：一要刀过头落，血上素旗，一滴也不要沾地；二要六月下雪，掩盖她的尸体；三要“这楚州亢旱三年”，这些都是不可能的，但作者让这些不可能的事桩桩都实现了。不屈的窦娥就在做了鬼以后仍然不饶过她的敌人。她“每日哭啼啼守着望乡台，急煎煎把仇人等待”，直待她遇到了并说服了她父亲窦天章，她才算报仇雪恨了。“窦娥冤”里这些不可能的情节是代表着当时人民的愤怒情绪和愿望的。
    关汉卿的浪漫主义也表现在他前面提过的“包待制三勘蝴蝶梦”这个戏也曾经被我们史家粗心地和马致远的“黄梁梦”、岳伯川的“李铁拐”一道，归入“表现厌世情绪和宣传道教的”作品之列。（见吕振羽：“简明中国通史”，五二四页）实则包待制的“蝴蝶梦”和庄周的“蝴蝶梦”毫无相同之处。也没有丝毫厌世思想和道教的宣传。关汉卿写这位人民理想的清官在审案后忽然身体困倦，伏在公案上歇息，在盹睡中他做了这样一个梦：
    百花烂熳，春景融和，亭子上结一个蜘蛛罗网，花间飞将一个蝴蝶儿来，正打在罗网中；包拯暗暗伤怀，蝴蝶曾打飞来；休道人无生死，草虫也有非灾。呀！……飞将一个大蝴蝶来，救出这蝴蝶去了。呀，又飞了一个蝴蝶打在罗网中，那大蝴蝶必定来救它。好奇怪啊！那大蝴蝶两次三番，只在花丛上飞，不救那小蝴蝶，佯常飞去了。圣人道：“恻隐之心，人皆有之，”你不救；等我救！
    包待制梦醒之后，就碰上中牟县送来王氏三兄弟为父报仇打死葛彪一案。经过几度勘问，十分友爱的他们兄弟三个争着认罪，但抵命的只要一人，包拯叫王大偿命，王母说：“我大儿子孝顺，杀了他谁人养活我？”叫王二偿命，王母又说：“第二个孩子会做生意……”于是王三自带枷，说：“大哥二哥都不偿命，眼见得是我了，不如早做个人情。”包公向王母说：“叫王三偿命中么？”王母说：“可不道‘三人同行小的苦’，就叫他偿命吧”。包公一想：“这老大老二准是她亲生的，而老三许是乞养过房、螟蛉之子，所以她一点也不心疼。”再责问那王母时，谁知恰恰相反，这王三倒是她亲生的。她说“若叫前房的儿子偿命，岂不显得做继母的心毒？”包拯听了此话深为感动，他想起梦中之事说：“三个草虫伤蛛丝，便和那子母官司都一等。三番继母弃亲儿，正应着午时一枕蝴蝶梦。”于是他终于设法让赵顽驴代替了王三，让一个活的王三回到这位贤母的怀抱。
    在这个剧中关汉卿把那位被称为铁面无私、一笑则黄河清的包待制描写成对一只打在蜘蛛网中的小蝴蝶都如此不忍的多情的老年人，因此他完全可能帮助被“权豪势要之家”欺压的善良的王家母子摆脱悲运。有的人说这里有“宿命论”，有什么“宿命论”呢？人民的幻想倒是有的。善良的幻想就是积极的浪漫主义。
    毛泽东同志总结全部文学历史的经验，提倡我们的文学应当是革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义的结合。我以为在戏剧文学方面，关汉卿的许多作品便是现实主义与浪漫主义相结合的很好的范例。

    就像人们称杜甫为“诗史”一样，人们也从关汉卿的作品看出元代的社会。尽管关汉卿不直接写元代的社会。明代韩邦奇（字苑洛，正德进士）就曾经把关汉卿和史家司马迁相比，这是很恰当的，关汉卿就是当时元代政治社会的一面好镜子。他以司马迁同样的抑郁磊落的情怀反映了当时的黑暗、污滥，也表现了被压迫的汉人南人在与黑暗滥污斗争中所表现的高贵品德。元朝中叶以后的剧作家偏重文字技巧，而轻视作为其灵魂的新锐的思想内容，所以元曲就渐渐失去初期的光彩。
    杂剧这样的新事物，由其是从人民中间产生，代表了人民的愤怒，所以受到广大被压迫的人民的热烈欢迎，但追从统治阶级的士大夫们总是对它估计不足的。直到明代以后，甚至直到清末，它的惊才绝艳才被一些较有见解的学者们加以较高估价。但元曲显然不只是“最自然的文学”，也是“最民主的文学”，“最富于人民性的文学”，这一种战斗的文学和其作家的真价值只有在人民时代才可能被真正认识。七百年前不被士大夫重视，并不断遭受统治者压迫的关汉卿在七百年后的今天受到全国人民的一致尊仰，甚至全世界进步人民都把他当作有贡献的文化名人来纪念，他的作品的极大部分由一千多个职业剧团，以昆剧、京剧、地方戏、话剧、新歌剧的各种形式在全国各地同时演出，这是中国戏剧家亘古未有的光辉遭遇。这真值得关汉卿和所有元代杂剧家们九泉含笑的，倘使他们有知的话。
    同时这也真值得我们骄傲，远在七个世纪以前，我们就有这样伟大的现实主义作家，他跟人民一道，跟艺人一道，细心学习，大胆创造；他推陈出新，薄古厚今；他巧妙地勇敢地通过历史剧、悲剧、喜剧的多样形式的艺术创造为当时被压迫人民服务。他开辟了高度政治思想和艺术形式相结合、现实主义和浪漫主义相结合的辉煌道路！
    他在七百年前已经吹起了反对侵略战争、保卫和平的响亮号角！
    跟我们大会相前后，全世界进步人民以同样的热情在纪念关汉卿，在重新估价他的创作活动对于人类的贡献。像苏联那样还演出了他的杰作“窦娥冤”。这具体说明关汉卿不止属于中国人民，他属于全体进步人类。而作为中国文艺工作者的我们有义务像欧洲的“莎士比亚学”一样，建立起自己的“关学”。可以说对于关汉卿的马克思主义的研究我们还在开始阶段，我们应该彻底肃清资产阶级形而上学的治学方法，更正确更细致地研究关汉卿，让这位七百年前伟大剧作家以及他的同代优秀作家的潜德幽光得到更大的发挥，以贡献于中国人民，贡献于全世界。
    在共产主义思想的光照下，踏着关汉卿的巨大足迹前进吧。让伟大的人民中国出现远远超过元剧时代的卓越的戏剧文学，让无比壮阔的中国人民剧坛，出现无数的关汉卿，为人民的利益，培养出无边招展的更新更美的戏剧花朵吧！
