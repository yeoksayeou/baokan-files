　　Ode to Zhangjiakou
　　Xiao San

　　In a flash, thirty-three years, three visits to Zhangjiakou. (Note 1)
　　The road was full of thorns, past events not to be looked back upon.
　　Now building anew, sweeping away decay and rot!
　　Great liberation of thought, everyone displays their talents.
　　Many people are experts, and experts are not afraid of being "rustic."
　　Splitting mountains and cutting cliffs, turning stone into tofu.
　　Drawing water to form reservoirs and canals, even dragons submit.
　　Fruits and flowers piled like mountains, grain and rice fill the granaries.
　　Horses and sheep cover the grasslands. Molten iron flows straight.
　　Industry and agriculture advance together, changing poverty to culture and wealth.
　　Soon mountains will yield black gold, and every county will have blast furnaces.
　　Every household will have electric lights, and everyone will read and study technology.
　　Songs from the frontier soar to the sky. Mongolians, Hans, and Hui people dance together.
　　The scenery inside and outside the Great Wall is beautiful, building a new special zone in the North.
　　Overwhelming the winds of Europe and the rains of America, full of drive and full of confidence!

　　(Note 1) I worked in Zhangjiakou in 1925, went to Zhangjiakou for the second time in 1945, and retreated in 1946; this is my third visit to Zhangjiakou.

    张家口赞
　  萧三
    瞬息卅三年，三入张家口。（注一）
    道路多荆棘，往事不回首。
    如今建设新，一扫腐与朽！
    思想大解放，人人显身手。
    人民专家多，专家不怕“土”。
    劈山削悬崖，石头变豆腐。
    引水成库渠，蛟龙也贴服。
    花果堆成山，粮米满仓库。
    马羊遍草地。铁水直流注。
    工农业并举，白穷变文富。
    行见山山出乌金。县县置高炉。
    家家户户电灯亮。人人读书钻技术。
    塞上歌声冲霄汉。蒙汉回民齐起舞。
    长城内外风景好，建成塞北新专区。
    压倒欧风和美雨，干劲足来信心足！
    （注一）一九二五年我在张家口工作过一九四五年第二次去张家口，一九四六年撤退；此次是第三次访张。
