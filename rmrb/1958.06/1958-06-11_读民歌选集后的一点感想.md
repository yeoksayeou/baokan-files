Some Thoughts After Reading the Folk Song Anthology
Shí Xīmín, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

On a Sunday morning, I finished reading the proofs of "The Song of Shanghai" edited by the Shanghai Culture Publishing House in one go. This is a collection of ninety new folk songs created by workers and farmers in Shanghai. Reading them, they are vivid, flavorful, and refreshingly uplifting.

The poems written by the farmers in the Western Suburbs District are so lively, so powerful, and so full of ideals that I was completely captivated by them:

	More people, good farming,
	More fertilizer, bumper harvest.
	Cattle fear cold spring,
	Fields fear shallow plowing.
	Plow deep one inch,
	Seedlings grow one foot.
	In the pot, in the bowl,
	In the commune, for all.
	Think big, work hard,
	Forty Articles soon realized.

I couldn't help but flip through the literary magazines on my desk and compare them to the poems written by poets:

	Countryside
		Golden gates
			Open!
	Land - Mother
			Longing for
				Rising
	Deep black chest, calling:
	Promising children -
	Come! Today
		I need
			Deep plowing

Compared in this way, it is clear that although the content of the poem written by this poet is good, the language and emotion of the poem are much worse than that of the folk song. I say this not to deliberately belittle poets or elevate folk songs. China needs poets, and folk songs also have their limitations. Since ancient times, there have been both *feng* and *ya* [classic categories of poetry in the Book of Songs], and poetry and folk songs have existed side by side. However, folk songs always demonstrate their most vital and nutritious qualities. Most successful poets have drawn from folk songs an inexhaustible source to enrich their own creations. Some of our modern poets, for some unknown reason, blindly pursue foreign forms, always look down on folk songs, and do not learn from classical poetry. As a result, not only is their life empty, but the new poetry they have been promoting for so many years has still not developed a form of its own and is not welcomed by readers. Isn't it time to resolutely revolutionize this situation?

Many of our musicians often lament the lack of new lyrics to compose music for. But what about now? A large number of vigorous and fresh folk songs reflecting the great era have emerged. Do you plan to set these "common people's songs" to music? I think it is time. Select a batch of excellent folk songs that have emerged from the rectification movement, edit and trim them, and you can compose one or several great choruses of the Shanghai Great Leap Forward that will be sung by tens of thousands of people. Wouldn't that be much better than composing those lifeless things like "Moonlight" and "Winter Snow" that were previously thought to be "highbrow" music? Can't our opera workers also draw useful things from folk songs?

Folk songs are the voice of the era. Our country is a country of poetry. Many ancient folk songs have been passed down, and a large number of new folk songs are emerging. There is an endless treasure here. The work of collecting and organizing folk songs should not only be done by publishing houses, but also by all comrades engaged in cultural and artistic work. Everyone should get involved, and everyone should recommend them. In this way, there is hope that new poems in national form, with the unity of opposites between realism and romanticism as their content, will bloom beautifully.

### 读民歌选集后的一点感想

    读民歌选集后的一点感想
    中共上海市委宣传部部长　石西民
    星期天的早晨，一口气读完了上海文化出版社编辑的“上海之歌”清样。这是九十篇上海工人和农民创作的新民歌选集，读来有声有色，味道醇厚，精神为之一爽。
    西郊区农民写的诗，是多么生动，多么有力量，多么有理想，我完全被它吸引住了：
    人多好种田，肥多是丰年。
    牛怕春冷，田怕浅耕。
    深耕一寸，苗长一尺。
    锅里有，碗里有，
    社里有，大家有。
    大胆想，大胆干，
    四十条纲要早实现。
    我禁不住翻起了案头的文艺杂志，把诗人写的诗拿来作一个对比：
    农村
        金色的大门
                  打开！
    土地——母亲
                渴望着
                  隆起
    深黑色的胸脯，呼喊：
    有出息的儿女们——
    来吧！今天
        我需要
                  深耕
    这样一比，显出这位诗人写的诗，内容虽好，但是诗的语言和诗的感情比那首民歌是差得多了。我说这个，并不是有意压低诗人，抬高民歌。中国需要诗人，民歌也有它的限制，自古以来，有风有雅，诗与民歌并行不悖。然而，民歌总是表现出它最有生命力，最富有营养。凡是有成就的诗人，大都从民歌中汲取了无限的丰富自己创作的源泉。我们现代的一些诗人，不知什么缘故，一味追求外国的形式，总是看不起民歌，也不向古典诗歌学习，因此不仅生活空虚，连提倡了多少年的新诗也至今不成一个形式，不受读者欢迎。这种状况，难道不是到了下决心革命的时候了吗？
    我们许多音乐工作者，平常总是叹息缺少谱曲的新词。而现在呢？大量刚劲清新的反映伟大时代的民歌出现了，是否打算为这些“下里巴人”谱上一曲呢？我看，也是时候了。把整风运动中涌现的优秀的民歌挑选一批，加以编辑剪裁，就可以谱出一个或几个万人传诵的上海大跃进的大合唱来。比起去谱那些过去以为“阳春白雪”的“月光”“冬雪”之类没有生命力的东西不是要好得多吗？我们的戏曲工作者难道也不能从民歌中汲取自己有用的东西吗？
    民歌是时代的声音。我们的国家是诗的国家。古老的民歌流传的很多，新的民歌又大量涌现，这里有无穷无尽的宝藏，搜集和整理民歌的工作，不仅出版社要来做，所有做文化艺术工作的同志都要来做。大家都动手，大家来推荐。这样，民族形式的以现实主义与浪漫主义的对立统一为内容的新诗歌，就有希望开出美丽的花朵来了。（原载“解放日报”）
