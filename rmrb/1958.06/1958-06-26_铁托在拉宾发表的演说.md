Tito's Speech in Rab

Editor's Note: On June 15th, Tito delivered a reactionary speech in Rab, Istria, slandering China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries, and once again expressing gratitude to American imperialism. The full text was published in the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" on June 16th. It is translated as follows:

Comrades:

On the occasion of celebrating the great and historic 150th anniversary of mining in Rab, please allow me to extend my warmest congratulations to you.

One hundred and fifty years ago, when the miners, the workers of Istria, began their work here underground, they could not have dreamed that there would be such a day when their descendants would be the masters of the mines, managing the mines themselves, and creating a better life for themselves according to their own wishes. For one hundred and fifty years, the miners of Rab have had many difficult moments, even sacrifices, shed much sweat and tears. At that time, the miners did not have the conditions they have today, nor the tools they have today.

Comrades, this coal mine has played a significant role since the liberation of Yugoslavia, because the miners of Rab have made a great contribution to our socialist motherland. Of course, it was impossible for us to immediately create the necessary conditions for the miners here and throughout the country in the early years after the war. But you must believe that we have done everything possible to improve the lives of miners and workers here and throughout the country.

You have seen that we recently created such material conditions that miners can receive pensions under the conditions that are most suitable for them. Of course, there are still some areas that should be corrected. But today I want to say here that we will soon be able to include miners in the ranks of senior workers according to the rights of miners. The work of miners is very arduous, they spend most of their lives underground, and miners have made a significant contribution to the foundation of our socialist motherland. Therefore, they have the right to stand at the forefront of senior workers.

Comrades, I know that you all understand the situation in our country today, and the various difficulties we often encounter on the road of socialist construction. I can only feel satisfied and proud that our country has such a highly conscious working class. Our working class understands its role, responsibilities, and obligations even in the most difficult moments. It labors patiently and tenaciously so that the present generation and future generations can live better lives. We still have many difficulties ahead of us, but the most difficult times have passed. Today we have such a solid foundation that we can move forward with confidence and build a better life. Our economic situation has now passed a turning point, whereas before we often had to worry about the situation tomorrow. You yourselves have seen that our country is now industrialized. Of course, not completely, but a solid foundation has been laid, and our products are increasing year by year. You saw the other day that our industrial production increased by 14% in the first four months of this year. If production continues to develop year after year and labor productivity continues to increase, we can raise the living standards of our people and increase the gross national income. This means that there are the best prospects for achieving our goals, the goals that our working class has been striving for before and after the war.

Comrades, I originally intended to come here and talk more about domestic issues, as I had promised. Not about certain difficult issues, but about those things that our working people do not understand clearly enough and require further explanation. But unfortunately, I have now decided to talk about those problems that are hindering us and preventing us from building a better life more quickly. Some unfortunate events have caused us, throughout the entire period of socialist construction after the war, during our strenuous efforts to get rid of various difficulties without success, to constantly encounter new obstacles and difficulties, and this has come precisely from the side that we least expected.

We recently held the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and this congress truly demonstrated not only the unity of the ranks of the League of Communists, but also the unity of the members of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia and the people of all nationalities in our country. The purpose of the congress was first to summarize our achievements, to comprehensively analyze our work between the Sixth and Seventh Congresses, and to learn from it, and also to conduct a certain analysis of those achievements that are significant not only for our country but also for other countries. We are a socialist country, so we believe that we should present at the meeting both the achievements and shortcomings of our internal development and domestic work, as well as those shortcomings outside our country that in our opinion may harm socialist ideas and the victory of socialism throughout the world. However, contrary to our wishes, we have therefore been misunderstood by the leaders of other socialist countries who cannot accept this. First, we were attacked because of the program, and then because of the report at the congress, and things that we neither said nor wrote were imposed on us, many things were distorted, and what we did not say was told to the people of these countries.

The current clamor attacking socialist Yugoslavia is not caused by any theoretical propositions in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the report made to the Seventh Congress, but has deeper roots. This was organized long before the Seventh Congress, and the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was only used as an excuse to attack the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The main reason for launching this movement is that we refused to sign the Twelve-Nation Declaration passed in Moscow in November 1957, and that we refused to participate in the so-called socialist camp for reasons that everyone has long been clear about. These reasons ultimately come down to our opposition to dividing the world into various camps.

As for the program itself, after some criticism, we accepted the opinion that certain places should be deleted. In addition, considering that the program is an important historical document, we ourselves believed that it should be fully clarified before the congress was convened, and therefore submitted it for broad discussion. As you know, the people of our country put forward one thousand five hundred various opinions, some of which were small and some of which were of an essential nature. We have also told our comrades abroad, the comrades in the Soviet Union and other countries, that the program is not final, but only a draft, and that our committee is still working to make it more perfect. We also explained that some things have been deleted or supplemented. Therefore, we should not be impatient and wait until the program is drafted and passed at the congress before explaining our views and opinions. We will consider them. Indeed, when some well-intentioned comrades, such as the Polish comrades, put forward some opinions to us, we accepted their opinions. However, when someone does not put forward principled opinions to us, but simply scolds us without thinking, the congress certainly cannot accept these opinions and cannot write them into the program.

However, the fact that we did not sign this declaration and did not participate in the socialist camp does not mean that we are opposed to the best cooperation with all socialist countries. On the contrary, it means that we advocate this kind of cooperation in all aspects, but we believe that in the current tense international situation, it is more beneficial to pursue a constructive peaceful policy together with other peace-loving countries that do not belong to any group than to participate in this camp, thereby intensifying the already tense world situation.

We believe that, considering our foreign policy, considering the principles of coexistence and the need for cooperation with all countries, that is to say, considering our entire peaceful policy, we must try every possible means to prevent the world situation from becoming acute and to avoid war. We believe that we must establish cooperative relations with all countries and should not limit ourselves to two camps. Conflicts will occur between these two camps, and one day they may break out into war because of them.

As for the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the report made to the Seventh Congress, which were used as an excuse for launching this fierce and far from comradely movement against our country and the League of Communists, I must emphasize that most of the quotations from this program and these reports used in the Eastern countries' newspapers and speeches are distorted, incorrect, sometimes fabricated, or taken out of context, which will lead people to a very wrong impression of our attitude.

Let us take as an example an assertion in the newspapers or speeches of some leaders in the Soviet Union, China, and other countries that I praised American aid and American imperialism. You know very well that I have never praised imperialism at any time. If anyone has heard it, please tell me. At the same time, they also said that I despise Soviet aid and attacked the Soviet Union, which is also an arbitrary statement. This assertion provides an excuse for the most brutal slander and defamation against the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

However, you probably remember that after the normalization of relations, I was one of the first people to try to make our people forget the serious wounds that Stalin had inflicted on us during the entire period from 1948 onwards. You will remember that, together with other comrades, I tried to find a way for us to forget the past and embark on a new road of normal socialist relations between our country and other socialist countries, mainly between our country and the Soviet Union. You know that I have never attacked the Soviet Union; but they said that I attacked the Soviet Union, and used this as an excuse to brutally abuse and defame the League of Communists. Thus, they forced some unwarranted things on us, and then brutally attacked us on this basis.

Here is what I said in my report to the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia: When we were in dire need of aid, that is, when Stalin imposed political, economic, and propaganda pressure on our country, we received economic and military aid from the United States. This greatly helped us overcome the enormous difficulties at that time. Although American aid only accounted for 4% of our national income, it would be incorrect and incomprehensible on our part to deny the important significance of this aid that we received in the most difficult period. Some people in the East want to use this matter for propaganda purposes, expressing doubts that the aid we received was not attached to any political or other concessions. But the facts are always the facts: we did not make any concessions of this nature, and no one made such conditions to us at that time.

This is what I talked about, and they attacked me because of this. Is it true that we needed help at that time? I think that no one in Yugoslavia who loves their country and hopes for the well-being of the people would disagree with this.

Regarding the issue of Yugoslav-Soviet relations and cooperation, I said this in the report: The development of Yugoslav-Soviet relations today, based on the Belgrade Declaration, is going smoothly. Mutual trade has also developed extensively. A series of agreements have been signed, such as: the establishment of industrial enterprises worth 110 million US dollars in Yugoslavia, a commodity loan totaling 54 million US dollars, scientific and technological cooperation, a loan of 30 million US dollars in gold or foreign exchange, and cooperation in the field of atomic energy.

In addition, a cultural protocol has also been signed, and on this basis, extensive cooperation is being developed, and a protocol on resolving dual nationality has been concluded; a special agreement on the construction of a lead factory and a chemical fertilizer factory has also been signed, etc. All this proves that the normalization of relations and the establishment of good friendly relations have achieved the material basis for economic cooperation, which is of great benefit to both countries.

This is what I said. Did I attack anyone here? No, I did not attack. Did I say something wrong? No, because it is correct! If I said that this would be beneficial to both parties and they felt bothered by it, what can I do?

Therefore, it can be seen from here that I did not ignore Soviet aid, nor did I attack the Soviet Union. I just stated the facts as they were. As for saying that this cooperation is beneficial to both parties, there are also sufficient reasons. Of course, I did not start considering which country would benefit more from this cooperation. I will not say now that we cannot get significant benefits from this cooperation, if they had not suspended the implementation of these agreements. We would have benefited.

There are similar situations regarding other accusations against my report. They quoted different fragments from this report and interpreted them incorrectly. The same is true of the various citations and excerpts from our program and other reports. We were particularly surprised that Comrade Rankovic's report aroused such great indignation, because he only mentioned the words that discussed us and made us feel unpleasant, and he did not mention the name of anyone who made such discussions when he did so, although we were being discussed publicly in front of the whole world. I think that the practice of the Eastern countries avoiding publishing our materials in full and avoiding making the public opinion of these countries understand these materials is not a good policy, and it is rare in the relations between socialist countries. As for us, you have seen that we publish their things, even the things they curse us with. You will also remember that we even published the entire resolution of the Cominform. However, they do not publish our things, because they are afraid that their people will know what we are saying. Obviously, what is involved here is that in order to make it easier to slander our country, this is why they only publish those things that can cause confusion and stimulate public opinion in these countries. When providing bad information to people who do not understand the facts, they will of course sometimes get agitated, but I want to tell you that in almost all these countries, the vast majority of the people no longer believe this set of things, because they say, you did this in 1948, but then you admitted that it was a mistake; then what can guarantee that you are not doing the same thing now and will say it is a mistake tomorrow?

If this program or some reports contain some other theoretical propositions that some comrades of other communist parties do not like, then comradely discussions can be held on these propositions. But in any case, this cannot be a reason to launch such a fierce movement to attack the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the entire socialist Yugoslavia. Let us take as an example the articles in the "People's Daily" (which is now known throughout the world for publishing slanderous attacks against us) and other Chinese newspapers, and the speeches of some Chinese leaders. They have carried out unprecedented and malicious slander and smears against the state and party leadership of socialist Yugoslavia. What is worse is that Soviet newspapers and the newspapers of other communist parties reprinted these slanders and smears. These "Marxists" are using this kind of abusive language, supposedly to defend the purity of the theoretical ideas of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. If Marx, Engels, and Lenin knew what kind of people were interpreting their science and in what way, they would be restless in their graves. It seems that Marxist science has undergone such a transformation after it was transmitted from Europe to the Chinese leaders that its founders would not be able to recognize it today, and would be particularly horrified by the moral principles that some Chinese leaders have forced on Marxism. Of course, if the science of Marx, Engels, and Lenin is distorted and interpreted in this way by some so-called Marxists in that distant country—they interpret Marxism in their inhumane way and want to teach others Marxism—Marx, Engels, and Lenin cannot be blamed.

If these Chinese leaders have internal difficulties—and there is no doubt that they do—let them solve these difficulties in some other way, and not with this hostile attitude towards Yugoslavia. We know what a difficulty it is in socialist construction to lack capital, funds, and loans, but we are striving to solve these problems in a fair and aboveboard manner, and not by harming another socialist country. They rudely accuse us of selling ourselves to the Americans in order to obtain 2 billion US dollars. First of all, the statement that we received 2 billion US dollars is not in accordance with the facts, although this money would have been very useful to us. Secondly, they forgot that during and after World War II, other countries also received a large amount of material assistance in the form of war materials and food from the United States, as well as assistance from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, including the Soviet Union and some other Eastern countries. They forgot that Yugoslavia was almost completely destroyed during World War II, and we were entitled to receive assistance, at least to partially heal the wounds of war.

If the Chinese leaders want to adhere to the Stalinist attitude towards relations between socialist countries, that is their business. But who will benefit, and what will be the result of a similar pressure since 1948—a pressure on a small socialist country that they themselves once condemned—is another question. They can believe that this pressure will never succeed either, and will leave even deeper negative traces in the international labor movement. They say in their writings and speeches that the events of 1948 must not be repeated, but the tone of their speeches, the slanders they carry out, and the methods of distortion and lies they use in their propaganda are the same as those they used in 1948.

This is also interesting: the reason why the Chinese leaders are fiercely attacking us is due to our foreign policy, that is, the policy of coexistence of countries with different social systems, which means that they are opposed to easing world tensions. In this respect, they are in the same position as the most reactionary warmongers in the West. The key to the problem is that our peace-loving policy, peaceful policy, and coexistence policy make them uneasy. However, war cannot solve various difficulties in socialist construction, even if a country has 600 million people. Some of them often like to emphasize the point of 600 million people. They say that in a possible war, there will still be about 300 million Chinese people left. We insist that and say that war and the destruction of war cannot establish and expand socialism in the world. This can only be achieved through unremitting efforts, through the creative labor of workers in various countries, and through constructive cooperation with other countries. War is the number one enemy of mankind, especially socialism, and we refuse to use it as a means of resolving disputes between countries due to different social forms and ideologies.

In terms of quantity and the quality of insults and abuse, the leaders of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian newspapers are in step with China's anti-Yugoslav movement, not to mention the leaders of Albania. When the problem is to slander Yugoslavia and its leaders, they are always the first to carry out this slander, if not the first. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party as a whole was specifically to attack, slander, and insult socialist Yugoslavia and its leaders. So much was talked about Yugoslavia at their congress that it seemed like a factional Bulgarian-Yugoslav congress. Instead of admitting the shortcomings and difficulties in their domestic development, instead of confessing past wrongdoings, instead of admitting the mistakes they made in their work, the Bulgarian leaders usurped the right to interfere in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. They fabricated all kinds of untruthful matters, criticized Yugoslavia's allegedly bad situation, and bragged about their situation in order to show that their situation was better, so as to comfort the Bulgarian people.

But what I have said so far does not include all the attacks on the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia. Other communist parties are also trying not to lag too far behind, reprinting all the slanders and attacks against our country, and occasionally adding some of their own things, in which there is no lack of insults and distortions of facts. Judging from the tone of all these speeches, attacks, and slanders, this movement seems to have been organized for a long time, and the various reconciliatory remarks made by some leaders in these countries from time to time have a clear purpose—to deceive world opinion in order to isolate us and discredit us as much as possible.

Of course, we still believe that national relations do not need to deteriorate, but this does not depend entirely on us. This movement has also greatly deteriorated the relations between our country and the countries whose leaders are attacking us. The remarks of some leaders that theoretical discussions must never be allowed to deteriorate national relations have completely gone bankrupt. If there are indeed principled and comradely discussions, we believe that national relations will not deteriorate. However, this is a movement against socialist Yugoslavia that is being carried out by the state and party leaders of socialist countries, so the deterioration of national relations is inevitable. This has already involved national relations, and the following facts can prove this: First, the Soviet government broke the agreement between the countries to give us credit loans for important projects for the second time in two years, right after our congress was held; second, after our congress was held, the Soviet Union cancelled the state visit; third, the visit of the delegation of disabled veterans was cancelled; fourth, other various mutual visits that had been planned have been abandoned or cancelled. Of course, this is done not in the ideological aspect but in the national aspect, so all the emphasis on the ideological aspect is absurd, because what is involved is obvious.

At the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party held recently in Sofia, Comrade Khrushchev delivered a speech. In addition to talking about other things, he attacked Yugoslavia and the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia for no reason, and his wording had nothing in common with comradely criticism. He described us as a Trojan horse, which Western imperialists wanted to use to sabotage socialist countries. In his speech—as will be seen later—he not only attacked the leaders of Yugoslavia, but also attacked the people of all nationalities in our country. Our people have suffered a lot from Stalin's policy of economic and political pressure, so we feel very sad when Comrade Khrushchev still repeats this practice and defends it today (although he fiercely condemned this policy at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union).

Comrade Khrushchev said in Sofia that we are the agents of class enemies in the labor movement. He said: "It is impossible to imagine that American monopoly groups would be interested in strengthening socialism and developing Marxist-Leninist theory. The representatives of this country (that is, Yugoslavia) insist that we have deviated from Marxist-Leninism, while they (that is, we Yugoslavs!) are standing on the correct position. As a result, a rather strange situation has emerged: the imperialists want to 'develop' Marxist-Leninism through this country (that is, Yugoslavia)." This means that he sarcastically accused us of colluding with the United States, which does not like socialism.

I completely agree with the view that the Americans gave us aid not to let socialism triumph in Yugoslavia, just as in 1921 and 1922, when the Soviet Union suffered serious difficulties and drought, they helped the Soviet Union, not because they hoped that this would be conducive to strengthening the Soviet government. At that time, they gave great assistance because there was a famine in the Soviet Union. After 1949, the Americans began to help us, not to let socialism triumph in our country—because they do not like socialism, and they do not hide this fact—but because, on the one hand, we were threatened by hunger, and on the other hand, because Yugoslavia could more easily resist Stalin's pressure and maintain its independence in this way. However, if some people in the United States have other hopes in this regard, it has nothing to do with us. Stalin's policy of economic blockade and threat caused huge losses to Yugoslavia. According to experts, this loss reached about 600 billion dinars. Therefore, the aid from the United States, Britain, and France greatly helped Yugoslavia, which was in serious trouble due to the blockade and the pressure from the Cominform. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France gained great moral benefits in the world.

Comrade Khrushchev often repeats that socialism cannot be built with American wheat. I think that those who know how to do it can build socialism, and those who do not know how to do it cannot build socialism even with their own wheat. Comrade Khrushchev said in his speech that we live on "the alms given to us by the imperialist countries in the form of outdated goods." First of all, our people do not rely on anyone's alms to live, but try their best to build a better life. Secondly, I have already said why we still have to accept some assistance in the form of long-term credit. Third, American wheat, cotton, and oil are not outdated goods, but commodities that are very much needed in every world market. However, American wheat is no worse than the Soviet wheat that we did not get, and the situation is the same in other commodities. For us, all these are very good commodities, things that are very valuable and very useful in the world, because they help us overcome more easily the difficulties that people who should have helped us make up for the damage caused by the economic blockade and political pressure from 1948 to 1953 are unfortunately creating for us. Finally, when Comrade Khrushchev himself recently asked to conclude an agreement with the United States on credit and long-term economic cooperation, what moral right do those who attack us have to blame us for American aid or credit? Not only is this illogical, but it is simply shameless to attack and slander us, saying that we sold ourselves in order to get American aid and credit.

Comrade Khrushchev said many things in his speech in Sofia that attacked Yugoslavia and its leaders; but the strangest thing is that he is now taking the same attitude as the Chinese leaders, that is, the attitude of defending the notorious Cominform resolution—a booklet that will always be a shameful stain in the history of relations between socialist countries and the international labor movement. When people read this so-called resolution today, they will see how absurd fabrications and slanders it is based on, and the purpose is only to be able to maliciously smear our party and our country. What is even more surprising is that in the current movement—not discussion!—Comrade Khrushchev and others have taken this action that disgraces socialism. Comrade Khrushchev likes to joke and say: "In battle, any stick will do." However, I think that in today's so-called discussion, or more precisely, in the unprincipled movement against socialist Yugoslavia, this is a weak and harmful weapon.

According to the logic of things, in the case that they excerpt the Cominform resolution to attack Yugoslavia, we should also go back and recount the various evils against our country and our people in more than four years, and our arguments to refute the accusations launched by Stalin in 1948 and later years. But where will doing this lead us?

Some people blame me because I said in my report that Stalin's policy was negative and harmful to Yugoslavia and some small countries, as well as to the Soviet Union itself. However, I think that what I said about Stalin is no more and no harsher than what was said at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In addition, the facts I cited have long been known to the whole world. This is history, the history of Stalin's policy of pressure and the history of his incorrect policy towards Yugoslavia, and we dare not and do not want history to be tampered with. Therefore, I only put this forward as a historical fact and nothing else. The League of Communists Congress has historical significance for the entire domestic life. It cannot remain silent on the negative manifestations of the past, it cannot cover up these manifestations, let alone fail to talk about the development of the situation in the period since the Sixth Congress.

All this is embarrassing for us, but we will struggle to defend ourselves against all unjust accusations, against all slanders and attacks, because all these clamors are to stifle our principled arguments about maintaining proper and just relations between socialist countries.

Comrades, you can believe that for these attacks, not only our leaders, but also the people of all nationalities in our country, have maintained complete calm and peace this time. It seems that we are destined to build the socialism of our country under constant attacks in all aspects. And the heaviest blows come from those who should be our most loyal and best friends. It seems that history has prescribed such a painful path for us: to even safeguard the development of socialism to prevent it from degenerating; to make socialism emerge from the current state of chaos in the world with a moral force that will provide it with a victorious path for further development.

Our leaders are accused of inciting the people to hate the Soviet Union and thus poisoning our people. But this is not true. On the contrary, we have had great difficulty in restoring the trust that could not be established among the people of all nationalities in our country due to the appalling actions taken against Yugoslavia after 1948. And who is trying to restore this trust now? Let them ask our ordinary people if this is true, so that they will know what the people of our country think about the recent actions taken against our country. We have not only not incited our people to oppose the Soviet people, but we will also strive in the future to prevent the resentment caused by the current movement from taking root too deeply in the hearts of our people. Our people do not hate the people of the Soviet Union or any other country. On the contrary, they admire the Soviet people and regard them as fraternal people who have suffered a lot in history and have carried out the great October Revolution. However, in the hearts of our people, there is also a lot of resentment caused by the actions taken against our country, and I believe that even the Soviet people do not understand this emotion.

Comrades, you see that even today, some leaders, such as the Chinese leaders, are publishing articles and speeches, as was common in 1948, saying that in all these disputes, the people of our country do not agree with us, but agree with them; saying that they are against us, but they can't do anything about it. Just think about it: the people of our country, who were able to liquidate the Hitlerite army in the past, liquidated all the Quislings, and could not liquidate us—although, according to them, the people of our country are against us! How wrong they have made estimates for the sentiments of our people and for their political maturity and awareness. In the movement against Yugoslavia, the old methods of 1948 have reappeared on the stage, and the only purpose is to deceive their own people. Because they cannot deceive the people of our country with that kind of propaganda. The people of our country know these things clearly, and they have many years of experience in this regard. This is why we do not hide anything. On the contrary, whenever possible, we publish all their speeches and accusations, so that the people of our country can understand them. But what do those who attack and accuse us do? They do not publish any of our materials, because they dare not let their people know the truth, that is, they dare not let them know our attitude. This absurd accusation is also harmful to them, because the truth will always win in the end. We will not leave the road of building socialism because of this movement. We also know how to overcome these new difficulties, and we know how to defend the pure banner of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In the past, we also gloriously held up this banner and passed through all the storms and attacks from all sides.

We do not want to carry out this struggle, because we have enough of our own troubles. However, since the struggle has been imposed on us, we will defend ourselves, and nothing will frighten us and prevent us from fighting for the victory of what we consider to be just and right. The main thing is that we have the unity of the people of all nationalities in our country and the close unity of our workers, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia.

Resolutely strive to further build our socialist country, raise the living standards of our working people, increase labor productivity, etc., and in this way we will give the best answer to those who attack and slander us. Comrades:

Of course, we have experience, patience, and courage, but the recent situation still makes us feel very difficult. This is not to say that anything can prevent us from moving forward victoriously in the construction of our country. We feel difficult for purely moral reasons. Obviously, we are morally superior to them, because we know that we are right. We are difficult because we know that this is unnecessary for them or us. However, since things are already like this, we will not stay at this point, but will only give answers at a certain period, giving answers calmly and peacefully, not in the same language as them, but in the language of real people, the language of truth—striving to defend our unity, striving to make our ranks united. Because it is important that we are building a better life and establishing true socialist relations, which is beneficial to us and to the further development of socialism.

Long live the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!

### 铁托在拉宾发表的演说

专栏：

    铁托在拉宾发表的演说
    编者注　铁托6月15日在伊斯特里亚半岛拉宾地方发表了一篇污蔑中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家、并对美帝国主义再次表示感恩戴德的反动演说。它的全文刊载在6月16日南斯拉夫的“战斗报”上。现译载如下：同志们：
    在庆祝伟大的具有历史意义的拉宾开矿一百五十周年纪念的时候，请允许我向你们致以最热烈的祝贺。
    一百五十年前，当矿工、伊斯特里亚的工人开始在这里的地下工作时，他们做梦也不可能想到会有这样一天，他们的后代自己就是矿井的主人，自己管理矿井，而且按照自己的愿望，为自己创造更好的生活。一百五十年来，拉宾的矿工曾经有过许多困难的时刻，甚至有过牺牲，流过许多汗和泪，那时矿工没有像今天这样的条件，也没有像今天这样的劳动工具。
    同志们，这个煤矿在南斯拉夫解放以后起了重大的作用，因为拉宾的矿工为我们的社会主义祖国作出了重大的贡献。当然，我们不可能在战后最初几年立刻就为这儿和全国各地的矿工创造应有的条件。但你们一定会相信我们已经尽了一切努力尽可能地改善这儿和全国各地矿工和工人的生活。
    你们已经看见，不久前我们创造了这样的物质条件使矿工可能根据最适合他们的条件领取养老金。当然，还有某些地方应该加以改正。但我今天在这儿想说的是我们很快就可以按照矿工的权利把矿工列入高级工人之列。矿工的工作十分繁重，一生的时间大部分都在地下度过，矿工给我们社会主义祖国的基础作出了重大的贡献。因此他们有权利站在高级工人的最前列。
    同志们，我知道你们都了解我国今天的情况，了解我国在社会主义建设道路上经常遇到的各种困难。我只能因为我国有这样觉悟很高的工人阶级感到满意和骄傲。我国工人阶级即使在最困难的时刻也了解自己的作用、职责和义务，它耐心地、顽强地劳动，以便现在的一代和将来的后代都生活得更好。我们面前还有许多困难，但最困难的时候已经过去了。我们今天具有这样巩固的基础，可以满怀信心地前进，建设更好的生活。我们经济情况今天已经走过了转折点，而在此以前我们却不得不经常为明天的情况而操心。你们自己也看见，我国现在已经工业化了。当然还不完全，但已经打下了牢固的基础，我国的产品一年比一年多。你们前几天看到今年头四个月我国工业生产增长了14％。如果生产年复一年地不断发展，劳动生产率不断提高，我们就可以提高我国人民的生活水平，提高国民总收入。这就是说，在达到我们奋斗的目标、达到我国工人阶级战前战后一直为之奋斗的目标方面，有着最好的远景。
    同志们，我本打算像我已经答应过的那样到你们这儿来多谈谈国内问题。不是谈某些困难的问题，而是谈谈那些由于我国劳动人民还不够清楚要求再作解释的事情。但可惜的是我现在决定来谈谈那些妨碍我们使我们不能更快地建设美好生活的问题。有些不幸的事使得我们在战后建设社会主义的整个时期，在我们紧张努力力求摆脱各种困难但不获成功的时期，一直遭遇着新的阻挠和困难，而且这恰恰来自我们很少能够想到的那一方面。
    我们前不久举行了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会，这次大会确是不仅显示了共产主义者联盟队伍的团结一致，也显示了南斯拉夫社会主义劳动人民联盟成员和我国各族人民的团结一致。大会的目的首先是总结我们的成绩，对我们在第六次代表大会至第七次代表大会之间的工作进行全面分析，并从中吸取教训，同时也对那些不仅对我国，而且对其他国家具有意义的成绩进行一定的分析。我们是社会主义国家，因此我们认为应该在会上既提出我国内部发展和国内工作的成绩和缺点，也提出那些在我们看来可能损害社会主义思想和社会主义在全世界胜利的我国以外的缺点。但是，事与愿违，我们却因此遭到其他建设社会主义国家的领导人无法接受的误解。先是因为纲领，后来因为大会上的报告而攻击我们，把那些我们既没有说过也没有写过的东西强加于我们，许多事情都被歪曲了，而且把我们没有说过的话就那样告诉给这些国家的人民。
    目前攻击社会主义南斯拉夫的叫嚷并不是由于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领和向第七次代表大会所作的报告中的任何理论上的提法所引起的，而是有更深的根源的。这是早在第七次代表大会以前很久就组织好的，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领不过是被用来作为攻击南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的一个借口而已。发动这个运动的主要原因，在于我们拒绝在1957年11月在莫斯科通过的十二国宣言上签字，在于我们出于每一个人早就清楚知道的原因而拒绝参加所谓社会主义阵营，而这些原因归根结蒂就是我们反对把世界分裂成各种阵营。
    至于纲领本身，经过若干批评以后，我们接受了意见，认为应该删去某些地方。此外，鉴于纲领是一个具有历史性的重要文件，我们自己也认为召开大会以前应该加以全面的阐明，因而把它提交广泛的讨论。你们知道，我国人民提出了一千五百条各种不同的意见，其中有些是小意见，有些带有本质的性质。我们也曾告诉国外的同志，告诉苏联和其他国家的同志，纲领不是定稿，只是草稿，我们的委员会还在继续工作以使其更加完善。我们也说明有些东西已经删去或者加以补充。因此不应没有耐心，等纲领拟就并在大会上通过以后，再说明自己的看法和意见。我们将予以考虑。的确，当某些善意的同志，例如波兰同志，向我们提出一些意见之后，我们接受了他们的意见。但是，当有人不是向我们提出原则性的意见，而是简单地，不加思索地责骂的时候，大会当然不能接受这些意见，不能把它写到纲领里去。
    但是，我们没有在这项宣言上签字和没有参加社会主义阵营这个事实，并不意味着我们反对同所有的社会主义国家进行最好的合作。相反，这意味着我们是主张在一切方面进行这种合作的，但是我们认为，在目前这种紧张的国际局势中，同其他同样不属于任何集团的爱好和平的国家一起奉行建设性的和平政策，比参加这个阵营从而使已经紧张的世界局势更为加剧要有益一些。
    我们认为，考虑到我们的外交政策，考虑到共处的原则和同一切国家合作的必要，也就是说考虑到我们整个的和平政策，必须用尽一切可能的办法努力使世界局势不致趋于尖锐，努力避免战争。我们认为必须同一切国家建立合作的关系，而不应该把我们自己局限于两个阵营之中。这两个阵营之间将会发生冲突，并且有朝一日可能会因为它们而爆发战争。
    至于说到被用作对我们国家和共产主义者联盟展开这种凶狠的、远非同志式的运动的借口的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领和向第七次代表大会所作的报告，我必须强调指出，现在东方各国的报刊和言论所用的这篇纲领和这些报告的引语大部分是歪曲的，不正确的，有时是捏造的，或者是断章取义，从而会使人对我们的态度得出十分错误的印象的。
    我们就举苏联、中国以及其他国家的报纸上或某些领导人的演说中的一种断言为例，他们说我赞美了美援和美帝国主义。你们知道得很清楚，我任何时候也没有颂扬过帝国主义，如果谁听到，谁就向我讲吧。他们同时还说，我轻视苏联的援助并攻击了苏联，这也是一种武断。这种断言提供了一种对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟进行最粗暴的污蔑和诽谤的借口。
    不过你们大概记得，在关系正常化之后，我是第一批竭力要我国人民忘掉斯大林在1948年和1948年以后的整个时期加在我们身上的那些严重创伤的人们之一，你们会记得，和其他的同志一起，我竭力设法使我们可以忘掉过去的事，使我们可以走上我国和其他社会主义国家之间、主要是我国和苏联之间的正常的社会主义关系的新道路。你们知道，我从来没有攻击过苏联；但是他们却说我攻击了苏联，并且以此为借口对共产主义者联盟进行最粗暴的谩骂和诽谤。于是，硬把某些莫须有的东西推在我们身上，然后又在这个基础上对我们进行最粗暴的攻击。
    这里就是我在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会上所作的报告中所说的话：在我们极其需要援助，即斯大林对我国施加政治、经济和宣传压力的时候，我们从美国获得了经济和军事援助。这在很大程度上帮助我们克服了当时的巨大困难。尽管美援仅占我国国民收入的4％，但是在我们方面，如果否认我们在最困难时期获得的这种援助的重要意义，那是不正确的和不可理解的。东方某些人想利用这件事达到宣传目的，表示怀疑我们接受的这种援助不附任何政治或其他让步。但是事实总是事实：我们没有作任何这种性质的让步，当时也没有人向我们提出这种条件。
    这就是我所谈的，他们就因这一点而攻击我。而我们当时需要援助这一点是否正确呢？我想在南斯拉夫没有一个热爱本国人民并希望人民美好的人会不同意这一点。
    关于南苏关系及合作问题，我在报告中是这样说的：以贝尔格莱德宣言为基础的南苏关系今天的发展是顺利的。相互间的贸易也有了广泛的发展。签订了一系列的协定，例如：在南斯拉夫建立价值一亿一千万美元的工业企业，总额五千四百万美元的货物贷款，科学技术合作，为三千万美元的黄金或外汇贷款以及原子能方面的合作等。
    除此以外，还签订了文化议定书，而且在此基础上正发展广泛的合作，并缔结了解决双重国籍的议定书；还签订了有关建设铅厂和人造肥料厂的特别协定等。所有这一切都证明，关系正常化和良好的友谊关系的建立已取得了经济合作的物质基础，这对两国都有很大好处。
    这就是我所说的。在这里我是否攻击了谁呢？是的，我没有攻击。我是否有说的不对的地方呢？没有，因为这是对的！如果我说这将对双方有利而他们却感到伤脑筋的话，那我又有什么办法呢？
    因此，从这里可以看出，我并没有忽视苏联的援助，也没有攻击苏联，我只是按事实的本来面目来说明事实，至于我说这种合作对两国都有好处，也是有充分理由的。当然，我并没有开始考虑哪一个国家从这种合作中得到更多的好处。现在我也不会说我们不能从这种合作中得到重大的好处，如果他们不曾中止执行这些协定的话。我们是会得到好处的。
    关于对我的报告的其他指责也有类似的情况，他们从这个报告中援引了不同的片段而加以不正确的解释。从我们纲领中和其他报告中所作的种种引证和摘录也有同样情况。我们特别感到惊异的是，兰科维奇同志提出的报告竟然激起了这样大的愤慨，因为他只不过提到了议论我们的和使我们感到不愉快的话，而且他在这样做的时候连发表这种议论的任何人的名字都没有指出来，虽然我们是公开地、在全世界面前被人议论的。我认为，东方国家避免全文发表我们的材料以及避免使这些国家的舆论了解这种材料的做法，不是什么好政策，而且在社会主义国家之间的关系中也是少见的。至于我们，你们已经看到，我们发表他们的东西，连他们咒骂我们的东西都发表，你们还会记得，我们甚至于发表了共产党情报局的全部决议。然而，他们却不发表我们的东西，因为他们怕他们的人民知道我们所说的话。显然，这里牵涉到的就是，为了更容易对我国进行诽谤，而这就是为什么只发表那些可以在这些国家造成混乱和刺激舆论的东西的原因。在对不了解事实的人民提供不好的情况的时候，他们当然有时要激动起来，可是，我要告诉你们。几乎在所有这些国家中，巨大多数的人民不再相信这一套了，因为他们说，你们在1948年是这样做的，后来却又承认这是一个错误；那末有什么可以保证你们现在不是做同样的事情而明天又说这是一个错误呢？
    如果这个纲领或一些报告中包含有其他共产党的某些同志所不喜欢的一些其他理论性的提法的话，那末可以就这些提法进行同志式的讨论。但是无论如何这不能成为发动这样激烈的运动来攻击南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导和整个社会主义南斯拉夫的理由。让我们以“人民日报”（它因发表反对我们的诽谤性攻击现在已经全世界闻名）和其他中国报纸的文章和某些中国领袖的演说为例。他们对于社会主义南斯拉夫的国家的和党的领导进行了空前未有的、恶毒的诽谤和诬蔑。更坏的是，苏联报纸和其他共产党的报纸转载了这些诽谤和诬蔑。这些“马克思主义者”就是用这种谩骂的语汇，据说是来保卫马克思、恩格斯和列宁的理论思想的纯洁性的。如果马克思、恩格斯和列宁知道是什么样的人在解释他们的科学和用什么样的方式来解释的话，他们会在坟墓中辗转不安。看来，马克思主义科学从欧洲传到中国领袖那里之后已经经过这样一种变形，以致它的创立者今天也会毫无办法把它认出来，而且会对某些中国领袖硬加给马克思主义的道德原则特别觉得不寒而栗。当然，如果马克思、恩格斯和列宁的科学在那个遥远的国家被某些所谓的马克思主义者作了这种歪曲的解释的话——他们用他们的不近人情的方式来解释马克思主义并且想给别人上马克思主义课——这是不能责怪马克思、恩格斯和列宁的。
    如果这些中国领袖们有内部困难的话——毫无疑问他们是有的——让他们用某种其他办法，而不要用这种对南斯拉夫的敌对态度来解决这些困难吧。我们知道，在社会主义建设中，缺乏资本、资金和贷款是怎样的一个困难，但是我们是努力用正大光明的办法，而不是在损害另一个社会主义国家的情况下来解决这些问题的。他们无礼地指责我们说，我们为了取得二十亿美元把自己出卖给美国人。首先，我们得到二十亿美元的说法并不符合事实，虽然这笔钱本会对我们很有用处。其次，他们忘记了在第二次世界大战期间和以后，其他国家也得到了美国提供的战争物资和食物的大量物质援助以及联合国善后救济总署的援助，其中包括苏联和某些其他东方国家。他们忘记了，在第二次世界大战期间，南斯拉夫几乎被完全摧毁，我们有资格得到援助，至少是为了部分地医治战争创伤。
    如果中国领袖们对于社会主义国家之间的关系要坚持斯大林主义的态度，那是他们的事情。但是谁会得到好处，类似1948年以来的那种压力——他们自己也一度谴责过对一个社会主义小国施加的这种压力——将会产生什么结果，则是另外一个问题。他们可以相信，这种压力也决不会成功，而会在国际劳工运动中留下甚至更深的消极痕迹。他们在写的文章和发表的讲话中都说，1948年的事件一定不能重演，但是他们讲话的语调，进行的诽谤以及在他们的宣传中所使用的歪曲和撒谎的方法，和他们在1948年所使用的是一样的。
    这一点也是有趣的：中国领袖们之所以猛烈攻击我们，是由于我们的外交政策，也就是具有不同社会制度的国家共处的政策，这意味着，他们是反对缓和世界紧张局势的，在这方面，他们同西方最反动的战争贩子处于同样的地位。问题的关键是：我们的爱好和平的政策、和平政策、共处政策使他们感到不安。但是，战争解决不了社会主义建设中的各种困难，即使是一个国家拥有六亿人口也罢，他们之中有些人常常喜欢强调六亿人口这一点，他们说，在一次可能发生的战争中，仍旧会留下大约三亿中国人。我们坚持认为并且说，战争和战争的破坏不可能在世界上建立和扩大社会主义，只有通过坚持不渝的努力，通过各国的劳动者的创造性劳动以及通过同其它国家进行的建设性合作，才能实现这一点。战争是人类特别是社会主义的头号敌人，我们拒绝以它作为解决各国间由于不同的社会形式和思想而发生的争执的手段。
    从数量以及侮辱和谩骂的质量来看，保加利亚的领导人和保加利亚的报纸是同中国反对南斯拉夫的运动步调一致的，更不用提阿尔巴尼亚的领导人了。当问题是诽谤南斯拉夫和它的领导人的时候，他们总是进行这种诽谤的第一批，如果不是第一个的话。保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会整个来说是专门来攻击、诽谤和侮辱社会主义南斯拉夫和它的领导人的。在他们的代表大会上对南斯拉夫谈得如此之多，以致它看来像是一种派系性保加利亚南斯拉夫代表大会。保加利亚领导人不是承认他们国内发展方面的缺点和困难，不是交代过去的错误行为，不是承认他们在工作中所犯的错误，而是僭取了干涉南斯拉夫内政的权利。他们捏造各种各样不真实的事项，批评南斯拉夫的据说是恶劣的情况，并且吹嘘他们的情况，以便表明他们的情况较好，这样来使保加利亚人民得到安慰。
    但是，我到现在为止所说的情况并不包括对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫进行的全部攻击。其他的共产党也在力求不太落后，转载反对我国的所有诽谤和攻击，偶而也添上它们自己的一些东西，在这些东西中也是不乏辱骂和对事实的歪曲的。从所有这些讲话、攻击的语调和诽谤来看，这个运动似乎是经过长期的组织的，这些国家内的某些领导人不时发表的各种和解的言论有一个明确的目的——欺骗世界的舆论以便尽可能地孤立我们和使我们信誉扫地。
    当然，我们仍然认为，国家关系无需恶化，但是，这完全不取决于我们。这一运动也使我们国家和其领袖对我们进行攻击的国家之间的关系大大恶化。某些领袖所谓决不可让理论讨论使国家关系恶化的言论已经完全破产了。如果进行的确有原则的和同志式的讨论的话，我们相信国家关系不会恶化。但是，这是社会主义国家的国家和党的领袖所正在进行的反对社会主义的南斯拉夫的运动，因此，国家关系的恶化是不可避免的。这已经牵涉到了国家关系，下面的一些事实可以证明这一点：一、苏联政府在我们的代表大会一开完以后就在两年中第二次破坏了给我们的重要工程以信用贷款的国与国之间的协定；二、在我们的代表大会一开完以后，苏联就取消了国事答访；三、残废退伍军人代表团的访问取消了；四、其他已经计划好的各种互相访问都已经放弃或取消了。当然，这不是在意识形态方面而是在国家方面做的事情，因此，一切对意识形态方面的强调都是荒谬的，因为其中牵涉到什么是显而易见的。
    在最近在索非亚举行的保加利亚共产党的第七次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫同志发表了演说，除了谈到其他事情之外，他毫无理由地攻击南斯拉夫和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领袖，其措词与同志式的批评毫无共同之处。他把我们说成是特洛伊木马，西方帝国主义者要在它的帮助下对社会主义国家进行破坏。在他的演说中——正像以后会看到的那样——他不但攻击了南斯拉夫的领袖，而且还攻击了我们的各族人民。我们的人民曾吃过斯大林的经济和政治压力政策的不少苦头，因此，当赫鲁晓夫同志今天仍然重复这种做法并加以辩护的时候（虽然他曾在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上激烈谴责过这一政策），我们感到很难过。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在索非亚说，我们是劳工运动中阶级敌人的代理人，他说：“决不能设想美国垄断集团会对加强社会主义和发展马克思列宁主义理论感到兴趣。这个国家（就是南斯拉夫）的代表人物硬说我们脱离了马克思列宁主义，而他们（即我们南斯拉夫人！）是站在正确的立场上的。结果就出现了相当奇怪的情况：帝国主义者想通过这个国家（即南斯拉夫）来‘发展’马克思列宁主义”。这意味着他以讽刺的口吻指责我们在同不喜欢社会主义的美国勾结。
    我完全同意这种看法：美国人给我们援助并不是为了让社会主义在南斯拉夫取得胜利，正像在1921年和1922年时一样，当时在苏联遭到严重困难和旱灾的时候，他们曾帮助过苏联，那并不是因为他们希望这会有利于加强苏维埃政府。那时他们所以给与巨大的援助是因为苏联发生了饥荒。在1949年以后美国人开始援助我们，那并不是为了让社会主义在我国取得胜利——因为他们不喜欢社会主义，而且他们也不掩饰这一事实——而是因为，一方面，我们受到饥饿的威胁，另一方面，因为这样南斯拉夫就能够比较容易地抵抗斯大林的压力，和维护它的独立。但是，如果美国的某些人士在这方面抱有其他希望，那同我们无关。斯大林的经济封锁和威胁政策给南斯拉夫造成了巨大的损失，据专家估计，这种损失达六千亿第纳尔左右。因此，美英法三国的援助使得由于封锁和共产党情报局的压力而处于严重的困境的南斯拉夫得到很大帮助，而同时美英法三国在世界上在道义方面得到很大好处。
    赫鲁晓夫同志时常重复说，社会主义是不能用美国的小麦来建立的。我想，懂得怎样做的人是能够建立社会主义的，而不懂得怎样做的人即使用自己的小麦也不能建立社会主义。赫鲁晓夫同志在他这篇演说中说，我们靠着“帝国主义国家以陈旧的货物的方式，给与我们的施舍生活”。首先，我们的人民并不依靠任何人的施舍生活，而是尽自己的巨大努力来建立更美好的生活。其次，我已经说过我们为什么还必须接受某种长期信贷方式的援助。第三、美国的小麦、棉花和油脂并不是陈旧的货物，而是每一个世界市场上都非常需要的商品。然而，美国的小麦并不比我们没有得到的苏联小麦差，而且在其他商品方面的情况也是这样。对我们来说，所有这些都是非常好的商品，是世界上价值非常高和非常有用的东西，因为它们帮助我们比较容易地克服了那些本来应当帮助我们弥补从1948年到1953年的经济封锁及政治压力给我们带来的损害的人不幸正在为我们制造的困难。最后，当最近赫鲁晓夫同志本人要求同美国缔结一项信贷和长期经济合作的协定的时候，那些攻击我们的人在道义上有什么权利由于美国的援助或信贷而责难我们呢？在这里不仅是不讲逻辑，而且攻击和诽谤我们、说我们为了得到美国援助和信贷而出卖自己，这种作法简直是无耻到极点了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在他在索非亚发表的讲话中说了许多攻击南斯拉夫和它的领袖们的话；但是最奇怪的是，他现在采取了中国领袖们所采取的那种态度，即为恶名昭彰的共产党情报局决议——永远是社会主义国家关系和国际劳工运动史上的可耻污点的一本小册子——进行辩护的态度。当人们今天阅读这个所谓决议的时候，他们将看到，它是以多么荒谬的捏造和诽谤为根据的，目的只是为了可以更加恶毒地诬蔑我们的党和我们的国家。更加令人惊奇的是，在目前的运动中——不是讨论！——赫鲁晓夫同志等又采取这种使社会主义丢脸的行动。赫鲁晓夫同志喜欢开玩笑地说：“在战斗的时候，用什么棍子都行”。但是，我认为，在今天的所谓讨论，或者更确切地说，在反对社会主义南斯拉夫的无原则的运动中，这是一个软弱的、有害的武器。
    根据事情的逻辑，在他们摘引共产党情报局决议来攻击南斯拉夫的情况下，我们也应当回溯既往，叙述在四年多内反对我国和我国人民的种种恶行和我们驳斥在1948和以后几年斯大林发起的指责的论点。但是，这样做会把我们引向何处呢？
    有人责备我，因为我在我的报告中谈到斯大林的政策是消极的，对于南斯拉夫和一些小国以及对于苏联本身都是有害的。但是，我认为，我所讲的有关斯大林的话并不比在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上讲过的话更多、更尖锐。此外，我所举的事实是全世界老早就知道的。这是历史，斯大林的压力政策的历史和他对南斯拉夫采取的不正确的政策的历史，而我们既不敢让，也不愿让历史被篡改。因此，我仅仅是作为历史事实提出这一点而不是别的。共产主义者联盟代表大会对整个国内生活有历史性重大意义，它不能够对过去的消极表现保持缄默，它也不能遮掩这些表现，更不能不谈第六次代表大会以来这段时期中的形势发展。
    这一切都是使我们为难的，但是，我们将奋斗，保卫我们自己对付各种不公正的指责，对付各种诽谤和攻击，因为这一切叫嚣都是为了扼杀我们关于社会主义国家之间保持适当和公正的关系的原则性论点。
    同志们，你们可以相信，对于这些攻击，不仅我国的领导人员，而且我们各族人民，这一次也都保持完全的镇定和平静。看来我们命定要在各方面的不断打击下建设我们国家的社会主义。而最沉重的打击则来自那些应该是我们最忠实和最好的朋友方面。看来历史已经为我们规定这样一条痛苦的道路：甚至要维护社会主义的发展以免它退化；要使社会主义从目前世界上的混乱状态中，带着一种将为它提供进一步发展的胜利道路的道义力量出现。
    我们的领导人员受到指责，说他们煽动人民仇恨苏联从而毒害我们的人民。但是，这是不真实的。正相反，我们很困难地在我们各族人民中间恢复由于四八年以后对南斯拉夫所采取的骇人听闻的行动而不能建立的信任。而现在是谁要恢复这种信任的呢？让他们去问问我们的普通人民，这是不是真的，这样，他们就会知道我们的人民对于最近对我国采取的行动有什么想法。我们不仅没有煽动我国人民去反对苏联人民，而且我们将来还要努力使目前这个运动所引起来的愤慨情绪不要在我们人民的心中扎得太深。我们的人民对苏联或任何其他国家的人民并不怀恨。正相反，他们钦佩苏联人民，把他们当作在历史上受过很多苦难，进行过伟大的十月革命的兄弟人民。但是，在我们人民的心中，也积下了由于对我国所采取的行动而引起的许多愤慨情绪，我相信，这种情绪就是苏联人民也是不了解的。
    同志们，你们看甚至在今天，有些领导人，譬如说中国的领导人，就像在1948年常见的那样，发表文章和讲话，说什么在所有这些争论中，我们的人民跟我们是不一致的，而跟他们是一致的；说什么他们是反对我们的，但是他们无法可想。只要想一想：我们的人民，过去有能力清算希特勒军队，清算了一切吉斯林分子而竟然不能清算我们——虽然据他们说，我们的人民是反对我们！他们对于我们人民的情绪和他们的政治成熟和觉悟作了多么错误的估计。在反对南斯拉夫的运动中，1948年的老方法又在舞台上出现了，其唯一目的是欺骗他们自己的人民。因为，他们用那种宣传欺骗不了我国人民，我国人民是清楚知道这些事情的，他们在这方面有多年的经验。这就是我们不隐瞒任何事情的原因。相反，在可能的时候，我们就发表他们全部的演说和指责，以便我国人民能够了解它们。但是攻击和指责我们的那些人是怎么作的呢？他们不公布我们的任何材料，因为他们不敢让他们的人民知道事实真相，那就是，不敢让他们知道我们的态度。这种荒谬的指责对他们也是有害的，因为真理最后总是要获得胜利的。我们不会由于这次运动而离开建设社会主义的道路。我们也知道如何克服这些新的困难，我们知道如何保卫马克思、恩格斯和列宁的纯洁的旗帜，过去，我们也光荣地高举着这面旗帜通过一切风暴和来自各方面的进攻。
    我们并不希望进行这场斗争，因为我们自己的烦恼已经够多了。但是，既然斗争已经强加在我们身上，我们就要自卫，任何东西都不会吓倒我们，使我们不敢为我们认为正当和公正的东西的胜利而战斗。主要的是，我们有我国各族人民的团结和我国工人、南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟的紧密的团结。
    坚决为进一步建设我们的社会主义国家而努力，提高我国劳动人民的生活水平，提高劳动生产力等等，这样我们就会给那些攻击和诽谤我们的人以最好的回答。同志们：
    固然，我们有经验，有耐心和勇气，但是最近的这种情况仍然使我们感到很困难。这不是说，有什么东西能够阻止我们在我国建设中胜利地向前迈进。我们感到困难是出于纯粹道义的原因。显然在道义方面我们比他们优越的多，因为我们知道我们是正确的，我们之所以困难，是因为我们知道这无论对他们或我们都是不需要的。但是，事情既已如此，我们就不停留在这一点上，而只在一定时期给予答复，心平气和地、镇静地给予答复，不用同他们一样的语言，而是用真正人的语言，真理的语言——努力捍卫我们的团结，努力使我们的队伍团结一致。因为重要的是，我们在建设更美好的生活和建立真正的社会主义关系，这对我们、对社会主义进一步发展都是有利的。
    南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国万岁！
