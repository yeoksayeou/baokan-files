    Sino-Soviet Friendship on the Don River
    Upstream on the Don River, there is a small mining town called Don City. The Don River originates near this city. On a bright spring day, we set out from Moscow to Don City to attend a Sino-Soviet friendship evening at a club.
    The car sped past the Oka River, the city of Tula, and through countless farms and forests, arriving in the Don City mining area. The soil here is all jet black, indicating a rich coal region. The car stopped in front of a beautiful two-story building, which is the "Mine Builders" Club.
    The club held its first grand Sino-Soviet friendship evening last May. Since then, Sino-Soviet friendship activities have become one of the main activities of the club in this mining area. They have held photo exhibitions introducing Chinese construction and city landmarks, regularly screened Chinese films, invited Zoya's mother, who had visited China, to give a report on her experiences in China, and invited a Moscow band to play Chinese works. Club Director Ushakov said that in the future, they will hold two reports each month introducing China's socialist construction, and they will also invite Chinese students from Moscow to join them in get-togethers. At this time, Club Instructor Valkin interjected, "We hope that when you have the opportunity, you will tell the Chinese miners that the 'Mine Builders' Club and the miners of Don City sincerely hope to establish regular contact with the Chinese miners' clubs and miners, and exchange experiences."
    Hanging on the walls of the club's corridor are photos introducing the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and previews of the Chinese film "Brother and Sister." In the Chinese book and photo exhibition room specially opened in the club, there are exhibitions of pictures such as "Cadres Going to the Countryside," "Achievements of China's First Five-Year Plan," and Chinese books, periodicals, and propaganda posters.
    The evening party was presided over by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. He read out a telegram from the participants of the evening party to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Beijing, in which they wished the Chinese people greater achievements in socialist construction. The establishment of the first Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association branch—the Don City branch—was also announced at the meeting. Then several Soviet comrades gave reports on China. The Chinese film "Acrobatic Performance on the Square" was shown at the evening party, and the club's amateur mining art group also performed many programs. Among them, four seventh-grade girls performed the Chinese folk dance wonderfully.
    It was already midnight when we left Don City. On the way back, everyone excitedly said that Sino-Soviet friendship is like the flowing water of the Don River, forever endless. (Shen Yiming) (Attached picture)

    顿河畔的中苏友谊
    顿河上游有一个不大的矿工城，名叫顿河城，顿河就是在这个城市附近起源的。在一个春光明媚的日子，我们从莫斯科出发到顿河城去参加一个俱乐部的苏中友谊晚会。
    汽车驰过奥卡河、图拉市，穿过无数田庄和森林，来到了顿河城矿区。这里的土色都是漆黑的，一望而知是个丰饶的煤区。车子在一座漂亮的二层楼建筑物前面停下了，这就是“矿井建设者”俱乐部。
    俱乐部在去年5月举行了第一次盛大的苏中友好晚会，从此以后苏中友好活动成了这个矿区的俱乐部主要活动内容之一。他们举办过介绍中国建设和城市名胜的图片展览，定期放映中国电影，他们曾请访问过中国的卓娅的母亲来作中国见闻的报告，请莫斯科的乐队来演奏中国的作品。俱乐部主任乌沙乔夫说，今后每月要举行两次介绍中国社会主义建设的报告会，还要请莫斯科的中国留学生来同他们联欢。这时俱乐部指导瓦尔金插进来说：“希望你们有机会时告诉中国的矿工同志们，顿河城的‘矿井建设者’俱乐部和矿工们非常希望同中国的矿工俱乐部和矿工兄弟建立起经常的联系，交流经验。”
    俱乐部走廊的墙壁上张挂着介绍武汉长江大桥的照片和中国电影“哥哥和妹妹”的预告。在俱乐部专门开辟的中国图书照片展览室里，展览着“干部下乡”，“中国第一个五年计划的成就”等图片和中国书刊、宣传画。
    晚会是由市委书记主持的。他宣读了晚会参加者致北京中苏友协总会的电报，他们在电报里祝中国人民在社会主义建设中获得更大的成就。会上还宣布了苏联第一个苏中友协支会——顿河城支会正式成立。然后由几位苏联同志作了关于中国的报告。晚会上放映了中国电影“广场上的杂技表演”，俱乐部矿工业余艺术小组也演出许多节目。其中四位七年级的小姑娘表演的中国民间舞十分精彩。
    离开顿河城时已是午夜十二时了，归途中大家都兴奋地说，中苏友谊正像顿河的流水一样永远无穷无尽。（沈一鸣）（附图片）
