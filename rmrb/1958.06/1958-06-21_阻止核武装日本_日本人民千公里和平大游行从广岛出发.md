    阻止核武装日本
    日本人民千公里和平大游行从广岛出发
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本人民举行的一千公里和平大游行今天上午十时从广岛开始了。这个由日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会组织的和平大游行的队伍，预定在8月12日到达东京，作为那时在东京举行的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的序曲。
    据今天日本的晚报报道，有一百五十多个广岛原子弹受害者和一般市民踊跃参加了大游行。游行队伍在广岛大学教授森泷市郎宣布游行开始后，从广岛市和平纪念公园原子弹牺牲者慰灵塔前面出发。广岛市长渡边忠雄曾经向游行队伍致词表示勉励。正在日本访问的法属苏丹和平委员会代表也特地赶来参加游行。游行队伍高举着“阻止核武装日本，拥护民主”的标语牌，高唱着“不许再使用原子弹”歌走过了广岛市街头。游行队伍将在今天晚上到达吴市。
