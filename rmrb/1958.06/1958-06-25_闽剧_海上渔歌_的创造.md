    Recommending Modern Theme Opera Repertoires

    The Creation of the Min Opera "Song of the Sea Fishermen"
    Yu Lin
    The play "Song of the Sea Fishermen" has been continuously performed in many opera genres over the years and has been loved by the majority of audiences. People can be educated and raise their vigilance from this small play of suppressing bandits and fighting special agents; at the same time, it is also because the theme of this play can intersperse rich and colorful opera dance movements, such as scenes of sailing at sea or fighting in the water, which can give the audience a lot of artistic enjoyment.
    However, due to the different types of opera and the conditions of the actors, as well as the different levels of understanding of using traditional performance programs to express modern life, the performance styles and qualities are not very uniform. This time, the Fujian Provincial Min Opera Experimental Troupe performed this play in Beijing. The most prominent feature is that it creatively designed a relatively complete set of performing arts based on the scenes of old fishermen, olive girls, and two Chiang Kai-shek special agents meeting at sea, mistakenly rescuing, suspecting, fighting, capturing... The "circling the stage" to represent the parents sailing the boat has been arranged in several different forms. Among them, the dance movements that express the small fishing boat being tossed and shaken in the stormy waves, coupled with the percussion music with water sounds, are the most outstanding, making people believe it without doubt. The special agents walking with "squatting steps" when they appear on stage is also to express the erratic nature of the small boat, and at the same time, it portrays these two sneaky characters. The hand-to-hand combat on the boat selectively uses the naval battle movements in traditional opera, which conforms to the specified scene, has a sense of rhythm, and is very beautiful. In this play, the harmony and unity of content and form are basically achieved. It can be seen that the director and actors have creatively carried out artistic conception. They were not limited by so-called "life reality", but boldly used the unique exaggeration techniques of Chinese opera art, including action exaggeration and emotional exaggeration, to realistically express the characters, highlight the theme, and greatly enhance the dramatic effect. The entire play is tightly gripping the audience's heartstrings, showing the great charm of Chinese opera art.
    The Min Opera "Song of the Sea Fishermen" is the most powerful proof. In the garden of Chinese opera art where a hundred flowers bloom, we need not only the "Crossroads Inn", which is famous both at home and abroad, but also the "Song of the Sea Fishermen", which expresses the heroic characters of the era.

    推荐现代题材戏曲剧目
    闽剧“海上渔歌”的创造
    俞琳
    “海上渔歌”这个戏，几年以来在很多戏曲剧种中不断上演，一直受到广大观众喜爱。人们可以从这个肃奸反特的小戏里，受到教育，提高警惕；同时，也是由于这个戏的题材能够穿插丰富多采的戏曲舞蹈动作，海上行船或是水中搏斗等场面，都可以给观众不少艺术上的享受。
    不过，由于剧种和演员条件不同，运用传统表演程式表现现代生活的认识程度也有出入，演出风格和质量便不很一样。福建省闽剧实验剧团这次到北京演出了这个戏，最突出的特点是：创造性的根据老渔民、橄榄姑娘和两个蒋匪特务在海上相遇、误救、见疑、格斗、捕获……等场景，设计了一套比较完整的表演艺术。父母行船的“圆场”，安排了几种不同的形式，其中表现小渔舟在惊涛骇浪之中颠簸动荡的舞蹈动作，配合上带水音的打击音乐，是最为出色的，使人置信不疑；特务出场走“蹲步”，也是表现小舟的飘忽不定，同时也刻划了这两个鬼鬼祟祟的人物；船上肉搏是有选择的运用了传统戏曲中的水战动作，符合规定情景，有节奏感，非常优美。在这出戏里基本上做到了内容与形式的和谐与统一。可以看出，导演和演员是有创造地进行了艺术构思。他们没有被所谓“生活真实”局限住，而是大胆地运用了我国戏曲艺术独特的夸张手法，包括动作夸张与情绪夸张，而真实地表现了人物，突出了主题，大大增强了戏剧效果。整整一出戏都是紧紧地扣住观众的心弦，显示是我国戏曲艺术的巨大魅力。
    闽剧“海上渔歌”就是最有力的证明。在百花齐放的我国戏曲艺术园地中，需要有赫然扬名中外的“三岔口”，更需要有表现时代英雄人物的“海上渔歌”。
