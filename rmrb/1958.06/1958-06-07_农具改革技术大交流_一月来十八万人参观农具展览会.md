　　Agricultural Tool Reform Technology Exchange
　　180,000 People Visit Agricultural Tool Exhibition in One Month
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Since the opening of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition on May 5th, it has received more than 187,500 visitors in one month.
    This exhibition has powerfully promoted the current agricultural tool reform movement and the technological revolution in agriculture. The Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, visiting delegation summarized their gains from the visit: Before the visit, they lacked confidence in achieving mechanization and cart transportation in mountainous areas. After seeing many transportation tools and agricultural implements suitable for mountainous areas, everyone was very excited.
    This exhibition is a large-scale national exchange of technology for reforming agricultural tools. People from all over the country came to visit to learn and to acquire treasures. The vast majority of visitors spent the whole day at the exhibition drawing diagrams. Many people forgot their fatigue and forgot to eat. The Henan Province visiting delegation drew more than 1,060 drawings of 693 categories of agricultural tools and implements.
    The exhibition solved many technical problems for the visitors that had not been solved for a long time in the past, and inspired their creativity.
    In the past month, 557 new agricultural tools, implements, and agricultural machinery have been sent from all over the country. The content of the exhibition is even more substantial and richer than when it opened.

　　农具改革技术大交流
    一月来十八万人参观农具展览会
    据新华社讯　全国农具展览会从5月5日开幕以来，一个月里已经接待了十八万七千五百多名观众。
    这次展览会有力地推动了当前的农具改革运动，推动了农业方面的技术革命。四川省北川县参观团总结参观收获时说：参观以前，他们对山区实现机械化、车子化缺乏信心，这次看到许多适于山区的运输工具和农具，大家很兴奋。
    这次展览会是一次全国规模的改革农具的技术大交流。各地来参观的人都是来学习，来取宝的。绝大多数参观者整天在展览会上画图样，许多人忘了疲劳，忘了吃饭。河南省的参观团就绘制了六百九十三类农具和工具的一千零六十多张图纸。
    展览会为参观者解决了不少过去长期没有解决的技术问题，启发了他们的创造性。
    一个月来，全国各地又送来了五百五十七件新的农具、工具和农业机械。展览会的内容比开馆时更加充实和丰富了。
