Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 8th: French democratic citizens are further uniting to fight for the defense of the republican system. A large number of new anti-fascist vigilance committees and committees for the defense of the republic are constantly emerging across the country.

    The "National University Defense of the Republic Committee" issued a statement, urging employees of various institutions of higher learning to pay attention to the dangerous nature of the current situation in France: "Parliament has adjourned, and whether public freedom exists in the future will completely depend on the government's whims, and this government is supporting those most vicious enemies of the Republic's freedom in Algeria." It called on the staff of various institutions of higher learning to establish more committees for the defense of the republic.

    The Defense of the Republic Committee of the Orne department united representatives of trade union organizations and youth organizations with different political leanings. The committee, in its distributed leaflets, called on all those who support the republic to take the cause of defending democratic freedom into their own hands.

    The leadership of the Paris District Trade Union Federation of the French General Confederation of Labor decided at a meeting on the 7th to take all necessary measures to establish and strengthen the Paris District Defense of the Republic Committee, and to take unified action more widely with other trade union organizations. The trade union leaders called on the working people to deal a powerful blow to any act that infringes on the rights of the working class and trade union freedom, as well as the conspiracies of the rebellious elements.

    In Montpellier, up to now, thirty-five parties and organizations, including the French Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Human Rights League, and the General Confederation of Labor, have participated in the local anti-fascist committee. This committee is actively expanding its influence to the entire province. In a statement, it called on the people to remain united in order to be able to retaliate against any infringement of freedom.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: Paris News: The French Communist Party increased its seats in the Republic Senate election held on the 8th, while De Gaulle's party, the Social Republican Party, which came to power with the support of military rebels, reduced its seats.

    According to statistics, the Communist Party won fifteen seats in the election of one hundred and twenty-three senators in this Senate re-election, an increase of two seats compared with the last election. De Gaulle's Social Republican Party won twenty seats, two fewer than last time. In addition, the Independent Party won thirty-seven seats, the Socialist Party nineteen seats, the People's Republican Party thirteen seats, and the Radical Socialist Party eighteen seats.

    The Republic Senate has a total of three hundred and twenty members, with a term of six years. It is stipulated that about half of the members are re-elected every three years, and they are produced by indirect elections.
