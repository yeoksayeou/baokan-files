A word from our readers:

	Light Switches Should Have Replacement Parts Available
	The springs inside pull-string light switches break easily. When they break, the hardware store doesn't have replacement parts, so you have to buy a whole new switch. A new switch costs five or six jiao, while the old switch becomes useless because a tiny spring is broken. This not only increases the burden on users but also wastes the nation's resources. It is suggested that factories manufacturing light switches, in addition to improving quality, should also manufacture some replacement parts for citizens to buy. Wu Yiling
	(Editor's Note: We forwarded Comrade Wu Yiling's suggestion to the Technical Section of the Eighth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building for consideration. They replied that this suggestion is very good. In order to save electrical materials, all electrical equipment manufacturers should produce some spare parts and supply them to users through the hardware materials company system.)

    电灯开关应该能配零件
    拉线的电灯开关，里面弹簧很容易坏，坏了电料行不能配零件，非重新买一个开关不可。买一个开关要花五、六角钱，而旧开关因为坏了很小的一个弹簧就全部没用，这不仅增加了用户的负担，也浪费了国家的物力。建议制造电灯开关的工厂除改进质量外，还应制造一些零件供市民配用。  吴懿玲
    （编者按：吴懿玲同志的建议我们转到第一机械工业部第八局技术处考虑后，他们回信认为这个建议很好，为了节约电工器材，各电工器材制造厂应生产部分零件，通过五金器材公司系统供应用户配购。）
