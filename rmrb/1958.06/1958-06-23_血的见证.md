The Testimony of Blood

    In order to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement, the French colonialists used extremely cruel and terrifying methods, slaughtering countless Algerian civilians. This bloody crime has aroused the indignation of people all over the world. Even among the French officers and soldiers who participated in the colonial war and the French journalists who had interviewed in Algeria, many people expressed dissatisfaction with the appalling atrocities of the French colonialists, and some of them wrote articles based on what they had heard and witnessed to expose the cruelty of the colonialists. The Indian "New Age" weekly on June 8 published the testimony of several eyewitnesses, including French officers.

    More Brutal Than Hitler

    A French officer of the 10th Infantry Regiment of the French colonial army said in a letter: "I feel extremely disgusted. Compared to us, the Germans are just unweaned babies. I witnessed the interrogation by the paratrooper intelligence agencies: they put the prisoners on the torture rack all day long and forced confessions. A water pipe was inserted into the prisoner's mouth, and water kept overflowing from the corners of his mouth. Some prisoners' elbows were tied and suspended, which could dislocate their bones..."

    Robbers Who Kill and Burn

    The French colonial army carried out a frenzied sweep of all villages that refused to cooperate with them. An Algerian pastor spoke about the reality of this sweep against peaceful villages and unarmed residents:

    "I don't want to talk much about the cruel atrocities, torture, the bombing of countless villages, women, children, and livestock, and the massacres carried out by paratroopers...
    Along the railway line, one can see clusters of small earthen houses on fire due to machine gun fire.
    I saw an officer show a photo. In the photo, a tractor was ramming an earthen house. The residents of the earthen house had already evacuated. However, the occupying forces often destroyed the houses one after another, regardless of whether there were people inside..."

    Bloodstains on the Door

    An eyewitness gave the following testimony about the atrocities of the French colonial military police:

    "I have seen officers learning how to whip. They quickly became experts in this work... I saw some soldiers, inspired by the example of the military police, imitating the methods of the military police to whip Algerians... In the torture room of the Debissa police station, anyone can see the strange crimson mark on the lower end of the door. This is because the paint on the door has peeled off and is stained with the blood of the tortured."

    血的见证
    法国殖民者为了镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动，使用了极端残酷的恐怖手段，屠杀了无数阿尔及利亚平民。这种血腥的罪行已经激起了全世界人民的愤怒。就是在参加过殖民战争的法军官兵中和曾到阿尔及利亚采访的法国记者中，也有不少的人对法国殖民者的骇人暴行表示不满，其中有些人并用耳闻目击的事实撰文揭露了殖民者的残暴罪行。6月8日的印度“新世纪”周刊发表了包括法国军官在内的若干目击者的见证。
    残暴赛过希特勒
    法国殖民军步兵第十联队的一个法国军官在一封信里说：“我感到无比的厌恶。德国人同我们比起来，只算得是乳臭未干的小儿。我目睹了伞兵特务机关拷问的情况：他们把受刑者整天放在拷问台上，进行着逼供。受刑者口里插入了水管，水不断地从嘴边溢出。有的受刑者的手肘被缚扎而悬吊起来，这样可以使他的骨胳脱节……”
    杀人放火的强盗
    法国殖民军对一切拒绝与他们合作的村庄，进行了疯狂的扫荡。阿尔及利亚的一位牧师谈到了这种对和平村庄及手无寸铁的居民进行扫荡的实况：
    “残酷的暴行，拷打，无数村庄、妇孺、牲畜被轰炸，伞兵进行的屠杀……这一切我都不想多谈了。
    沿着铁路线，人们看得见一簇簇的小土屋由于被机关枪的扫射而着火。
    我看见一个军官出示一张照片。照片上，一辆牵引车冲击着一所土屋。土屋的居民已经先期撤走了。但是占领军往往不管土屋里面有没有人，就一间挨着一间地冲毁……”
    门上的血迹
    有一个目击者对法国殖民军警的暴行作了这样的见证：
    “我曾经看见军官们学习鞭打的方法。他们很快地就成了这个工作上的专家……我看见一些兵士，他们受了宪兵榜样的鼓舞，仿照宪兵的办法鞭打阿尔及利亚人……在得比萨警察局进行拷打的那间房里，谁都看得见房门下端奇异的殷红迹印。这是因为门上的油漆已经脱落，沾上了受刑者的鲜血。”
