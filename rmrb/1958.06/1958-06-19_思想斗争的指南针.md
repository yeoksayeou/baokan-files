The report by Chairman Mao on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is the compass of ideological struggle in universities and colleges. Here, I will focus on some fragments of experience and feelings in the actual struggle.

In the anti-Rightist struggle, we deeply realized that Chairman Mao's report theoretically shattered the revisionist views spread by the Rightists at that time, clarified the thinking of the intermediate masses, clearly distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and the difference between the two types of contradictions, ideologically armed the party cadres and the masses, and isolated the bourgeois Rightists. Let me give some examples to illustrate the enormous theoretical power of Chairman Mao's report in the anti-Rightist struggle.

After the Central Committee issued instructions on rectification on May 1st last year, and before the publication of Chairman Mao's report, the thinking of teachers and students in our school was quite chaotic; the bourgeois Rightists took the opportunity of the rectification to carry out rampant anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Under these circumstances, although the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in higher education was very sharp and obvious, many people lost their way under the captivity of revisionist views, and some party members and even individual leading cadres made mistakes (some of whom later degenerated into Rightists). Their errors in theoretical viewpoints reflected political errors, and even betrayal. They believed that there were no class contradictions in the contradictions among the people; the contradiction between the Party and non-Party members was the main contradiction at present; and the contradictions among the people since liberation were the main contradictions in the school. Chairman Mao's report made these issues clear: the contradictions among the people included both the contradictions between the working people and the contradictions between the exploiting and exploited classes. The latter also had its antagonistic side. In the specific circumstances of higher education, a comprehensive understanding of the contradictions among the people, especially the understanding that non-antagonistic contradictions can be transformed, is of great significance to practical work.

Regarding the issue of the boundary between the enemy and ourselves, after the People's Daily editorial "Why is This?" was published on June 8th last year, it became an urgent issue that the broad masses demanded to be resolved. Many people asked us: "Is the contradiction between the people and the Rightists a contradiction between the enemy and ourselves or a contradiction among the people?" "Why is opposing the Party opposing socialism?" These were urgent questions raised entirely from actual struggles, and we explored and sought answers to these questions in order to better guide the struggle. Chairman Mao's report gave us the answers. From this, it can be seen that Chairman Mao's works, like other classic Marxist-Leninist works, are not dogmas divorced from reality but guides for combat operations. Studying Chairman Mao's works is not an unattainable task; as long as you devote yourself to the struggle and engage in independent thinking based on Marxism-Leninism in the struggle, you can gradually learn Chairman Mao's thought. Only in this way can you truly understand Chairman Mao's works.

The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and the method of great blooming, great contending, and great debate, as elucidated in Chairman Mao's report, have guided the ideological socialist revolution carried out in universities and colleges in the year since the anti-Rightist struggle. The anti-Rightist struggle repelled the frenzied attacks of the bourgeois Rightists and politically isolated and discredited the representative figures of the Rightists. However, many ideological problems among the masses have not been resolved. Looking back now, there are two more prominent problems:

    1. Some people with Right-leaning ideas have the ideas of "political danger" and "keeping their mouths shut," "Troubles arise from opening your mouth, and worries only come from sticking your neck out," and dare not expose their thoughts.

    2. Not only have the bourgeois ideas, bourgeois individualism, liberalism, anarchism, etc. in teaching and scientific research not been resolved, but also the political issues of Party leadership, democracy and dictatorship, democracy and centralism, etc. have not been completely resolved.

This shows that resolving the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves prepared the conditions for resolving the contradictions among the people and the all-people rectification, but it cannot replace the handling of the contradictions among the people. We must continue to use the methods of great blooming, great contending, and great debate to handle the contradictions among the people and carry out the ideological socialist revolution. Therefore, since the anti-Rightist struggle, one movement has followed another in the past year, and heated debates have been launched on issues such as rectification and reform, the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the discussion of "redness" and expertise, scientific research, the handling of Rightists, and teaching reform. This series of movements fully proves the brilliance of the conclusions in the report.

Here, I want to focus on the issue of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in resolving contradictions among the people and developing Marxism-Leninism.

    1. Marxism-Leninism must be developed in struggle, not only in the past but also now, and inevitably in the future. Why? Chairman Mao pointed out: "Marxists are still in the minority, whether among the entire population or among intellectuals." The multiple great debates we have conducted in the past year fully prove the correctness of this conclusion. Under the socialist system and the political power led by the working class, socialism has superior conditions in the ideological struggle. However, it is also easy to create an illusion that people all sincerely approve and support Marxism (naturally, the vast majority support the leadership of the Party and patriotism). Therefore, after a basic victory is achieved in a struggle, some comrades are prone to a right-leaning paralysis that does not see ideological problems and relaxes ideological struggle, thinking that there will be peace and tranquility on the ideological front from now on. A series of great debates have also proved that it is necessary to have a realistic and comprehensive assessment of the ideological situation of bourgeois intellectuals. In other words, we must see both sides: on the one hand, socialism has superior conditions in the ideological struggle; on the other hand, the struggle of who will defeat whom in ideology still requires a considerable amount of time to resolve.

In the past year, the law of each debate in our school has been that the Western wind prevails over the Eastern wind at the beginning, but after fierce debate, Marxists persuade the majority, and the thinking of the masses greatly improves.

    2. What policy should be adopted towards non-Marxist ideas? Chairman Mao pointed out: "Only by adopting the methods of discussion, criticism, and reasoning can correct opinions be truly developed, erroneous opinions be overcome, and problems be truly solved."

Practice has proved that there are many benefits to doing so, which can be summarized as follows:

First, establishing the opposite side can maintain our ideological and political vigilance.

Second, the masses receive vivid and effective education, and anti-materials enhance the masses' immunity. Moreover, through great blooming, great contending, and great debates, the tendency of simply instilling and reciting dogmas that existed in the past in teaching has actually been largely overcome, and each debate provides a large amount of rich ideological viewpoints.

Third, cadres are tempered in the struggle, and the combat effectiveness of cadres in the ideological struggle is improved. A large number of new forces have emerged in the ideological struggle, and many comrades have been able to criticize anti-Marxist ideas with viewpoints, materials, and vividness at the great debate meetings. This has also expanded the Marxist front.

After the rectification movement, we entered a new period of socialist construction centered on the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Universities and colleges should resolutely implement the policy of education serving politics and serving production, and realize the combination of education and production. The transformation of bourgeois intellectuals in universities and colleges still needs to be continued. Recently, the Party Central Committee proposed not to be afraid of bourgeois professors, to break down superstitions, to eliminate feelings of inferiority, to plant red flags, and to pull out white flags. All of this makes us deeply realize that to do a good job, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's works.

### 思想斗争的指南针

    思想斗争的指南针
    中共清华大学委员会副书记　艾知生
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，是高等学校中思想斗争的指南针。在这里，我只着重谈一下在实际斗争中的一些片断的体会和感想。
    在反右派斗争当中，我们深刻体会到，毛主席的报告从理论上粉碎了当时右派所散布的修正主义观点，澄清了中间群众的思想，明确地分清了敌我界限和两类矛盾的区别，从思想上武装了党的干部和群众，孤立了资产阶级右派。这里让我举些例子来说明一下毛主席的报告在反右派斗争中的巨大的理论威力。
    去年“五一”中央发出整风的指示以后，以至毛主席的报告发表以前，我校师生的思想是相当紊乱的；资产阶级右派趁整风机会大肆进行反党反社会主义活动。在这种情况下，虽然高等教育事业中的社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争是十分尖锐明显地摆在面前，可是在修正主义观点的俘虏下，不少人迷失了方向，有些党员甚至个别领导干部犯了错误（其中有些人后来堕落成为右派）。他们在理论观点上的错误，反映了政治上的错误，以至叛变。他们认为：人民内部矛盾中没有阶级矛盾；党和非党的矛盾是当前的主要矛盾；自解放以来人民内部矛盾就是学校中的主要矛盾。毛主席的报告使这些问题明确了：人民内部矛盾既包括了劳动人民之间的矛盾，又包括了剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的矛盾。后者还有其对抗性的一面。在高等学校的具体情况下，全面理解人民内部矛盾，特别是了解非对抗性矛盾可以转化这点，对于实际工作有重大的意义。
    关于敌我界限问题，在去年6月8日人民日报社论“这是为什么”发表以后，变成广大群众迫切要求解决的问题。不少群众问我们：人民群众与右派的矛盾是“敌我矛盾还是人民内部矛盾？”“为什么反党就是反社会主义？”这些完全是从实际斗争中提出来的迫切问题，我们在这些问题上摸索、寻求解答以便更好地指导斗争。毛主席的报告给了我们解答。由此可见，毛主席的著作像马列主义的其他经典著作一样，不是脱离实际的教条而是战斗行动的指南。学习毛主席的著作并不是高不可攀的事情，只要全力投入斗争，在斗争中以马列主义为基础进行独立思考，就能够逐步学到毛主席的思想。也只有这样，才能对毛主席的著作真正有所体会。
    毛主席报告中所阐明的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，大鸣大放大辩论的方法，指导了反右斗争以后一年来高等学校所进行的思想上的社会主义革命。反右派斗争击退了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，在政治上孤立了、搞臭了右派的代表人物。但是在群众中还有许多思想问题并未解决。现在回想起来，较突出的问题有两点：
    1、一部分有右倾思想的人，有“政治危险”、“守口如瓶”的想法，“是非皆因要开口，烦恼只为强出头”，不敢暴露思想。
    2、不仅教学、科学研究上的资产阶级思想、资产阶级个人主义、自由主义、无政府主义等等没有解决，就是政治上的党的领导问题、民主与专政、民主与集中等问题，也并未彻底解决。
    这就说明：解决了敌我矛盾为解决人民内部矛盾和全民整风准备了条件，但并不能代替人民内部矛盾的处理，还必须继续用大鸣大放大辩论的方法来处理人民内部矛盾，进行思想上的社会主义革命。因此，反右派斗争以后，一年来运动一个接一个，在整改、干部下放、红与专的讨论、科学研究、处理右派、教学改革等问题上都展开了热烈的辩论。这一系列的运动，都充分证明报告中论断的英明。
    这里，想着重谈谈关于百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，在解决人民内部矛盾、发展马克思列宁主义方面的问题。
    1．马列主义必须在斗争中发展，不但过去是这样，现在是这样，将来也必然是这样。为什么？毛主席指出：“无论在全人口中间，或者在知识分子中间，马克思主义者仍然是少数”。我们一年来所进行的多次大辩论，充分证明了这个论断的正确。在社会主义制度和工人阶级领导的政权下，社会主义在意识形态的斗争中具有优胜的条件。但也往往容易出现一种假象，似乎人们都是衷心赞成拥护马克思主义的（自然拥护党的领导和爱国的是绝大多数），因此，有些同志在一场斗争取得基本胜利后，很容易产生一种看不见思想问题，放松思想斗争的右倾麻痹的倾向，认为思想战线上从此天下太平。一系列大辩论也证明了，对于资产阶级知识分子的思想状况需要有切实的全面的估计，换句话说就是必须看到两个方面：一方面社会主义在意识形态的斗争中具有优胜的条件；另方面，意识形态的谁战胜谁的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。
    一年来，我们学校的每次辩论的规律都是，开始时西风压倒东风，而经过激烈的辩论，马克思主义者说服多数，群众的思想大大进步。
    2．对于非马克思主义的思想，应该采取什么方针？毛主席指出：“只有采取讨论的方法批评的方法，说理的方法，才能真正发展正确的意见，克服错误的意见，才能真正解决问题。
    实践证明，这样作的好处很多，归纳起来有以下几点：
    首先，树立了对立面，可以保持我们思想上政治上的警惕性。
    其次，使群众受到生动有效的教育，用反面材料增强了群众的免疫力。并且通过大鸣大放大辩论，实际上在很大程度上已经克服了过去在教学中存在的单纯灌输、背诵教条的倾向，每次辩论提供了大量丰富的思想观点材料。
    再次，在斗争中锻炼了干部，提高了干部在思想斗争中的战斗力。大批新生力量在思想斗争中涌现出来，许多同志都能够在大辩论会上有观点、有材料、有声有色地批判反马克思主义的思想。这也就是扩展了马克思主义的阵地。
    经过整风运动，我们进入以技术革命、文化革命为中心的社会主义建设的新时期。高等学校应该坚决贯彻教育为政治服务、为生产服务的方针，实现教育与生产的结合。高等学校中对资产阶级知识分子的改造还需继续进行。最近党中央提出不要怕资产阶级教授，要破除迷信，打掉自卑感，插红旗，拔白旗。所有这些使我们深深地体会到要做好工作必须认真学习毛主席的著作。
