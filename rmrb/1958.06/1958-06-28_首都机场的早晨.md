    Morning at the Capital Airport
    Chen Zhijian

    Night has just vanished, and the sky is not yet bright, but the Capital Airport has already begun its day of intense labor.

    The lights in the dispatch building are as bright as day. The lights from the control tower on the top floor shine out from the circular row of windows, illuminating the surrounding area like a lighthouse on the ocean. On the third floor, there's a small room with no lights and no people, but the skilled sound of typing can be heard from time to time. This is a teletype machine automatically recording weather reports from various locations, providing forecasters with the data to create weather maps.

    The first thing dispatch and meteorological personnel do in the morning is go to the forecast room to listen to the weather briefing. On a weather map filled with lines and symbols, the "vast expanse of sky" is compressed to the size of a single sheet of newsprint. After the forecaster's explanation, the fantastical and unpredictable wind and clouds have a clear origin and destination. By looking at the high-pressure areas, low-pressure areas, and the basic movements of various weather systems marked on the map, one can have a "thorough understanding" of the overall weather situation across the country.

    If there are no complex weather changes, the dispatch office will notify the various departments to prepare. The entire airport then becomes active.

    The convex-shaped dispatch building and the terminal building face each other from a distance, forming the main architectural elements of the Capital Airport. A wide, flat concrete runway runs alongside the two buildings, looking like a thoroughfare to heaven when viewed from either end. A beige sedan slowly drives along the runway. Sometimes it stops midway, lingers for a few seconds, and then continues. This is the duty dispatcher inspecting the pavement. He just found a small stone on the edge of the runway, stopped the car to remove it, ensuring the safety of aircraft takeoffs and landings.

    On the apron, engineers and mechanics make final checks on all parts of the aircraft. Only after they are satisfied that there are no faults do they allow the tractor to tow the aircraft to the passenger apron for the transportation department to arrange its use.

    After listening to the weather briefing, captains submit their flight mission orders and pilots' health certificates, and then go to the navigation room with the aircrew to collect navigation charts, airport charts, and cloud penetration charts. Whether they are new or experienced captains, they carefully calculate various navigation data and review these basic skills before each flight. They select the best flight path to safely and quickly deliver passengers and cargo to their destinations. The captains of China's Civil Aviation always use this standard to evaluate all their work.

    The flight status board for departing aircraft hangs on the wall of the transportation office. The board lists the flight numbers, departure times, and estimated arrival times for domestic and international flights. Transportation service personnel are constantly busy, but all work is carried out in an orderly manner.

    As a hub of air transportation, the Capital Airport has the dual mission of promoting the country's economic construction and strengthening international friendly exchanges. Among the departing air passengers are Party and state leaders, experts and engineers, as well as delegations and dignitaries from various countries.

    Sometimes, the Capital Airport also receives some strange "passengers": leopards and pandas going to live in the Oslo Zoo, turtles and monkeys going to Copenhagen to participate in medical experiments, or pigs, chickens, and cats going to Shanghai, Chongqing, Urumqi, and other places to propagate their species. Thanks to the safety and speed of civil aviation flights and the dedicated care of the service personnel, there have never been any injuries or deaths among the animals transported.

    Opening the cargo hold in the morning, you can sometimes smell the fresh fragrance of vegetables. These are fresh vegetables such as green vegetables, bean sprouts, leeks, cucumbers, and tomatoes produced in the suburbs of Beijing, which have now become air cargo for export, ready to be loaded onto aircraft and transported to Ulaanbaatar. Various equipment, devices, and urgently needed materials are also frequently transported from the Capital Airport to support construction in various regions.

    The preparation work is basically completed one hour or half an hour before the aircraft's departure. Passengers arrive at the airport one after another in special buses of the Civil Aviation Administration or in their own cars. They quickly complete travel procedures in the luggage room and are then received into the waiting room to rest.

    The departure time has arrived. The duty dispatcher conducts a strict inspection of all preparation work and, being satisfied that everything meets safety requirements, signs the flight mission order and issues the takeoff command.

    Every morning, aircraft departing from the Capital Airport carry passengers of different nationalities and professions, carrying books and newspapers, carrying urgently needed equipment and materials for industrial and agricultural production, and also carrying the service enthusiasm and leaping determination of civil aviation personnel.

    首都机场的早晨
    陈志坚
    夜，刚刚消逝，天色还没有大亮，首都机场一天的紧张劳动便开始了。
    调度大楼里灯明如昼。楼顶塔台的灯光从环形排窗里射出来，远照着四周的场地，好像海洋上的灯塔。三楼上有一间小屋子，里面没有灯光，也没有人，但是却不时地响起熟练的打字声。这是电传打字机在自动地记录着各地的天气报告，供给预报员作为填制天气图的资料。
    调度人员和气象人员早晨的第一件事就是到预报室去听取气象讲解。在画满了线条、符号的天气图上，“万里长空”被压缩到只有一张四开报纸那么大。经过预报员的解说，奇幻莫测的风云也就有了来踪去迹。再看看图上标示的高压区、低压区以及各个天气系统的基本动向，则全国各地的天气大势就能“了如指掌”。
    要是天气没有什么复杂的变化，调度室便通知各部门进行准备。整个机场就活跃起来了。
    凸字形的调度大楼和航站大楼遥遥相望，构成为首都机场的建筑主体。一条宽坦的混凝土跑道就在两座大楼的旁边，站在这一头望那一头，宛若一条通天的青云大道。一辆米黄色的小座车在跑道上慢慢地驶行着。有时它在半路上停下来，逗留几秒钟，然后又继续前进。这是值班调度员在检查道面。他刚才在跑道边上发现了一块小石头，就停下车来把它搬掉，保证飞机起降的安全。
    在停机坪上，工程师和机械员对飞机的各部分作了最后检查，认为完全没有故障了，才让拖车把飞机牵引到客机坪，交给运输部门安排使用。
    机长们听完了气象讲解，交验了飞行任务书和驾驶员的健康证明书，又和空勤组的人员一起到领航室去领取航行图、机场图和穿云图。无论是新机长还是老机长，在每次飞行以前，他们都要认真计算各种航行数据，重新复习这些基本功课。选择一条最好的飞行路线，把旅客和货物安全地、迅速地送到目的地。中国民航的机长们永远拿这个尺度来评价自己的全部工作。
    出港飞机的动态牌挂在运输室的墙上，牌子上写着国内航线和国际航线各个班次的飞机号码、起飞时间和预计到达的时间。运输服务人员不停地忙碌着，但是一切工作都进行得很有秩序。
    作为航空交通的中心，首都机场担负着促进祖国经济建设和增强国际友好往来的双重使命。在出港的航空旅客中，有党和国家的领导人，有专家和工程师、还有各国的代表团和贵宾等。
    有时，首都机场还要接待一些奇奇怪怪的“旅客”，到奥斯陆动物园里去安家落户的豹和熊猫，到哥本哈根去参加医学试验工作的乌龟和猴子，或者是到上海、重庆、乌鲁木齐各地去传宗接代的猪、鸡、猫等。由于民航飞机的安全、迅速和服务人员的尽心照顾，收运的动物从来没有发生过伤亡的事故。
    早晨打开货仓门，有时可以闻到一股蔬菜的清香，这是北京郊区出产的青菜、豆芽、韭菜、黄瓜、蕃茄等新鲜菜蔬，现在也都成了出口的航空货物，正准备装机运往乌兰巴托。从首都机场还经常运出各种器材、设备和急用物资，去支援各地建设。
    在飞机起飞一小时或半小时之前准备工作基本上完成了，旅客们乘坐民航局的专用客车或者自备汽车陆续地到达了机场。他们在行李间里很快地办好了旅行的手续，就被接待到候机室里去休息。
    起飞的时间到了。值班调度员对全部准备工作进行了严格的检查，认为一切都合乎安全要求，于是在飞行任务书上签了字，发出了起飞的命令。
    每天早晨，从首都机场起飞的飞机载着不同国籍、不同职业的旅客，载着书报和邮件，载着工农业生产上急需的器材和物资，同时也载着民航工作人员的服务热情和跃进决心。
