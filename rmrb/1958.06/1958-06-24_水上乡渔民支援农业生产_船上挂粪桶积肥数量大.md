Fishermen in Shuishang Township Support Agricultural Production
Large Quantities of Manure Accumulated in Buckets Hung on Boats
    (Our dispatch) The fishermen of Shuishang Township, Yantian, Xiapu, Fujian Province, who live on boats, used to relieve themselves directly into the water. This year, the local supply and marketing cooperative, in order to support the great leap forward in agriculture, mobilized fishermen to hang manure buckets on their boats to accumulate fertilizer. After propaganda and education, all 432 fishing boats in the township have now broken away from superstitious thinking and the habit of not accumulating fertilizer, and have all hung up manure buckets. According to statistics from the past twenty days, more than 2,000 dan of human manure and urine have been accumulated. It is estimated that more than 36,000 dan can be accumulated throughout the year.

    水上乡渔民支援农业生产
    船上挂粪桶积肥数量大
    本报讯  福建省霞浦盐田水上乡住居在船上的渔民，过去大小便都拉在水里。今年当地供销社为支援农业大跃进，发动渔民在船上挂粪桶积肥，经过宣传教育后，现在全乡四百三十二条渔船均已打破迷信思想和不积肥习惯，全部挂上粪桶积肥。据二十天来的统计，已积人粪尿二千多担，以此估计全年能积三万六千多担。
