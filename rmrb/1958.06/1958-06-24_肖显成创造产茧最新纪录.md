    Xiao Xiancheng Creates New Silk Cocoon Production Record
    Xiao Xiancheng, a silkworm farmer from Xinlu No. 2 Cooperative in Hepu Township, Luotian County, Hubei Province, has set a new national record for silkworm cocoon production. According to the county's relevant leading departments' verification, his three silkworm egg sheets produced a total of 468 jin and 3 liang of cocoons, averaging 156 jin and 1 liang per sheet. This is 34 jin and 11 liang more than the national record (121 jin and 6 liang) set last year by Lin Shuying, a national silkworm farming model in his county, and about 27 jin more than the new record (over 129 jin) set by Li Wenying of Fuyang County, Anhui Province, this year.
    Xiao Xiancheng consistently implemented various technical measures, such as "feeding with good mulberry leaves until full, sparse placement and frequent feeding," and "picking up silkworms without dropping them, and placing them on the cocooning frames without damaging the cocoons." When the silkworms were about to begin their "third molt," he stayed in the silkworm rearing room, changing mulberry leaves and feeding the silkworms up to 18 times every day and night. Therefore, the three silkworm egg sheets he raised not only had a high survival rate but also produced strong silkworms and large cocoons.

    肖显成创造产茧最新纪录
    湖北省罗田县河铺乡新路二社养蚕员肖显成创造了全国养蚕产茧最新纪录。根据县里有关领导部门的验收，他养的三张蚕种共产茧四百六十八斤三两，平均每张产茧一百五十六斤一两。这比他所在县的全国养蚕模范林淑英在去年创造的全国纪录（一百二十一斤六两）高出三十四斤十一两，比今年安徽省阜阳县李文英的新纪录（一百二十九斤多）约高二十七斤。
    肖显成始终如一地贯彻了各项技术措施，如像“良桑饱食、稀放勤喂”，“提蚕不掉蚕、上簇不损茧”等。在蚕儿将开始“三眠”时，他守候在养蚕室里，每昼夜换桑喂蚕达十八次之多。因此，他养的三张蚕种，不但成活率高，而且蚕壮茧大。
