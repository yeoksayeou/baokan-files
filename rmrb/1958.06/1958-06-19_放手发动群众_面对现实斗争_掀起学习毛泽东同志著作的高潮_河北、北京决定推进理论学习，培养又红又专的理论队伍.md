    Boldly Mobilize the Masses, Confront Realistic Struggles
    Launch a High Tide of Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Works
    Hebei and Beijing Decide to Promote Theoretical Study and Cultivate a Theoretical Contingent That Is Both Red and Expert
    This newspaper reports, according to the Hebei Daily: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to boldly mobilize the masses, confront realistic struggles, and launch a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's works, throughout the province.
    The Hebei Provincial Committee believes that the current state of theoretical study in the province cannot meet the needs of the developing situation. From the perspective of the entire province, there is still dogmatism that is divorced from reality in certain departments, especially in theoretical education work, and there is relatively widespread empiricism among many practical work cadres who neglect theory. This dogmatism and empiricism cause people to be conservative and lack vigor, theory cannot be combined with practice, and practical experience cannot be elevated to theory. Therefore, it has become a major obstacle to ideological liberation, and the Marxist-Leninist level of cadres cannot be effectively improved, which affects the better implementation of the Party's line and policies.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the Hebei Provincial Committee has clearly put forward the main tasks on the theoretical and ideological front. First, it is necessary to study the Party's general line for socialist construction, learn to grasp the laws of socialist construction, and struggle against all right-leaning conservative ideas and ideas that deviate from the general line. Second, continue to complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, carry the struggle between the two roads to the end, promote proletarian ideology, eliminate bourgeois ideology, and further launch a resolute struggle against various bourgeois ideologies, especially revisionism. Third, transform the ideological style and working methods of cadres, learn to master dialectical materialism in practical work, learn to master the ideological methods and working methods of Marxism-Leninism, and struggle against all conservative, mind-binding dogmatism and empiricism. The Hebei Provincial Committee also believes that these three tasks are a guideline that closely integrates theoretical study with the current tasks of struggle, and this guideline must be firmly grasped to thoroughly improve the Party's theoretical study. This requires focusing on studying Mao Zedong's works, combined with studying relevant basic theories of Marxism-Leninism; focusing on studying and researching realistic problems, combined with studying historical experiences; combining theoretical study, current affairs and policy study, and summarizing practical experiences; and fully utilizing the rectification method to study theory, so as to achieve unity of learning and application.
    In early June, at the meeting of prefectural and municipal party committee secretaries, propaganda ministers, and cultural and educational ministers convened by the Hebei Provincial Committee, Comrade Ma Guorui, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee Secretariat, delivered a report entitled "Go All Out, Aim High, and Strive for a Great Leap Forward in Theoretical and Ideological Work." He emphasized that all cadres should invigorate their spirits, eliminate feelings of inferiority, give play to their creative spirit, dare to think, dare to do, dare to learn, and dare to apply, vigorously attack theory, and dare to climb the ladder of theory and science. The comrades from various places who participated in the meeting used the methods of big blooming, big contending, and big debating to discuss the issue of strengthening theoretical study. They unanimously agreed that the secretaries must take action, the entire Party must mobilize, and a climate of studying theory must be established.
    In accordance with the decision of the Provincial Committee, the meeting discussed specific measures to strengthen theoretical study. First, leading cadres above the county party committee throughout the province must be organized to put in hard work and vigorously attack theory. It is necessary to closely integrate studying theory, researching policies, studying problems, summarizing experiences, writing articles, and guiding work. Second, the "East Wind" journal established by the Provincial Committee should take Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology, focus on the practical problems of socialist revolution and construction in Hebei Province, and research and discuss various aspects of socialist construction in the province and the theoretical problems raised by cadres and the academic community. Third, improve the theoretical study of cadres and intellectuals in service, and mobilize and organize all cadres and intellectuals to launch a high tide of studying theory, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Fourth, strengthen the construction of Party schools. Fifth, cultivate a theoretical contingent that is both red and expert.
    This newspaper reports that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a decision to establish a proletarian Marxist-Leninist theoretical contingent that is both red and expert throughout the city.
    This decision requires that, starting this year, within about five years, the Beijing Municipal Committee and party committees at all levels cultivate a group of Marxist-Leninist theoretical work cadres who have excellent political qualities, a certain amount of practical work experience, have systematically studied Chairman Mao's works and the works of Marx, Lenin, etc., and whose theory is consistent with practice. According to this requirement, a theoretical contingent will be immediately established throughout the city, including a small but highly capable full-time contingent and a larger part-time contingent distributed across various work posts. A theoretical office with about ten people will be established in the Municipal Committee, and theoretical offices with three to five people will be established in district committees, large factory and enterprise party committees, and university party committees. This is a full-time contingent with more than one hundred people. This type of theoretical office will be directly led by the party committee secretary and will conduct theoretical research and theoretical publicity work centered on the central work of the party committee. At the same time, a part-time theoretical contingent of about five hundred people will be established among the cadres throughout the city. The members of this contingent will mainly be party member cadres at the bureau and department head level, and some young cadres who are currently engaged in theoretical work and are suitable for theoretical work will be absorbed. The Municipal Committee has also decided to prepare for the publication of a theoretical journal.
    Regarding the training methods and tasks undertaken by the theoretical contingent, the Beijing Municipal Committee's decision points out: (1) Study practical problems in Beijing's socialist construction; (2) Participate in struggles on the theoretical front and study theoretical problems raised by cadres and the academic community; (3) Give reports on theoretical issues to cadres, tutor in-service cadres in theoretical study, and can also go to universities and middle schools to teach political classes; (4) Study Chairman Mao's works and the works of Marx, Lenin, etc.; (5) Write one or several theoretical and practical papers each year.
    Currently, the Beijing Municipal Committee and some district committees, factory and enterprise party committees, and university party committees are actively carrying out the construction of the theoretical contingent in accordance with this decision.

    放手发动群众　面对现实斗争
    掀起学习毛泽东同志著作的高潮
    河北、北京决定推进理论学习，培养又红又专的理论队伍
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：中共河北省委决定放手发动群众，面对现实斗争，在全省普遍掀起学习马克思列宁主义，特别是学习毛泽东同志著作的高潮。
    河北省委认为，全省当前理论学习的情况还不能适应形势发展的需要。从全省来看，在某些部门，特别是理论教育工作中，还有脱离实际的教条主义，在许多实际工作干部中，还比较普遍地有忽视理论的经验主义。这种教条主义、经验主义，使人们因循守旧，缺乏朝气，理论不能结合实际，实际经验不能提高到理论上来。因此成为思想解放的主要障碍，干部的马克思列宁主义水平不能有效地提高，也就影响到更好地贯彻执行党的路线和方针政策。
    河北省委根据党的“八大”二次会议的精神，明确提出了当前在理论思想战线上的主要任务。一是必须学习党的社会主义建设总路线，学会掌握社会主义建设的规律，向一切右倾保守思想和离开总路线的思想作斗争；二是继续完成政治思想战线上的社会主义革命，把两条道路的斗争进行到底，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，进一步向各种资产阶级思想，特别是修正主义，开展坚决的斗争；三是改造干部的思想作风和工作方法，在实际工作中学习掌握唯物论辩证法，学习掌握马克思列宁主义的思想方法和工作方法，向一切因循守旧、束缚头脑的教条主义、经验主义作斗争。河北省委并认为这三方面的任务是使理论学习和当前斗争任务密切结合起来的一条纲，必须紧紧抓住这条纲彻底改进全党的理论学习。这就必须以学习毛泽东著作为中心，结合学习有关的马克思列宁主义基本理论；要以学习研究现实问题为中心，结合研究历史经验；要把理论学习、时事政策学习和总结实际经验结合起来，要充分运用整风的方法学习理论，使学用一致。
    6月初，在河北省委召开的地市委书记、宣传部长、文教部长会议上，河北省委书记处书记马国瑞同志作了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，实现理论思想工作大跃进”的报告。他强调提出：全体干部要振奋精神，去掉自卑心理，发挥独创精神，敢想敢做、敢学敢用，猛攻理论，敢于攀登理论和科学的阶梯。各地参加会议的同志，以大鸣大放大辩论的方法，对加强理论学习问题进行了讨论，一致认为必须书记动手，全党动员，树立学习理论的风气。
    会议根据省委的决定，讨论了加强理论学习的具体措施。首先，全省县委以上的领导干部，都要组织起来，下苦功夫，猛攻理论。必须把学习理论，研究政策，钻研问题，总结经验，写文章和指导工作密切结合起来。第二，省委创办的“东风”，应以马克思列宁主义为指导思想，以河北省当前社会主义革命和建设的实际问题为中心，研究讨论全省社会主义建设各方面的问题和干部、学术界提出的理论问题。第三，改善在职干部、知识分子的理论学习，发动和组织全体干部、知识分子掀起学习理论，特别是毛泽东同志著作的高潮。第四，加强党校建设工作。第五，培养又红又专的理论队伍。
    本报讯　中共北京市委作出了在全市范围内建立起一支又红又专的无产阶级的马克思列宁主义的理论队伍的决定。
    这个决定要求，从今年开始，在五年左右的时间内，北京市委和各级党委培养出一批政治品质优良，具有一定的实际工作经验，系统地学习过毛主席的著作和马克思、列宁等的著作，理论与实践相一致的马克思列宁主义理论工作干部。根据这个要求，在全市范围内，立即建立一支理论队伍，它包括一个人数较少的精干的专职队伍和一个人数较多的分布在各个工作岗位上的兼职的队伍。在市委设立十人左右的理论工作室，区委、大工厂企业党委和高等学校党委设立三至五人的理论工作室。这是一支拥有一百多人的专职的队伍。这种理论工作室由党委书记直接领导，围绕党委的中心工作进行理论研究和理论宣传的工作。同时，在全市的干部中建立一支五百人左右的兼职的理论队伍，这个队伍的成员以局、处长一级的党员干部为主，吸收一些正在作理论工作和适于作理论工作的青年干部。市委并决定筹办理论刊物。
    关于理论队伍的培养方法和理论队伍所担负的任务，北京市委的决定中指出：（一）研究北京市社会主义建设中的实际问题；（二）参加理论战线的斗争，研究干部和学术界中提出的理论问题；（三）给干部作理论问题的报告，辅导在职干部的理论学习，并且可以到大学、中学去教政治课；（四）学习毛主席的著作及马克思、列宁等的著作；（五）每年写一篇或几篇有理论有实际的论文。
    目前，北京市委和一些区委、工厂企业党委和高等学校党委正在按照这个决定，积极地进行理论队伍的建设工作。
