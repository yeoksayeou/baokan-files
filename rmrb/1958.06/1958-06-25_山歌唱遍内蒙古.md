Mountain Songs Sung Throughout Inner Mongolia
Han Yanru
　　The east wind blows and the water flows west, not fearing the Yellow River won't turn back.
　　Mountain songs sung to Mao Zedong, watching the Yellow River become clear.
　　White sheep, yellow sheep, mountain songs winding over eighteen ridges.
　　Playing the flute horizontally and striking the qin vertically, mountain songs sung into a hollow sound.
　　Putting down the flute and pulling the erhu, mountain songs sung throughout Inner Mongolia.

    山歌唱遍内蒙古
    韩燕如东风一刮水西流，不怕黄河不回头。山歌唱到毛泽东，眼看黄河要澄清。绵羊白，黄羊黄，山歌盘过十八道梁。横吹笛子竖打琴，山歌唱成一洼声。放下笛子拉胡胡，山歌唱遍内蒙古。
