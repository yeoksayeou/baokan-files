Record of High Forest Yields

	Chinese Fir
	The Heping Cooperative in Xihou Township, Nanping County, Fujian Province, has more than 1,350 hectares of Chinese fir forest, with an average stock volume of approximately 600 cubic meters per hectare, setting a national record for large-scale high-yield Chinese fir forest. In southern China, generally, a mature Chinese fir forest can only produce 200 to 300 cubic meters of timber per hectare.

	Within the Heping Cooperative's Chinese fir forest, there is a plot of over 50 mu (approximately 3.3 hectares) of 38-year-old Chinese fir forest with an average stock volume of 1,174.5 cubic meters per hectare, ranking first in the country and rarely seen in the world.

	Masson Pine
	The Jiande Forest Farm in Zhejiang Province has a plot of over 30 mu (approximately 2 hectares) of 37-year-old Masson pine forest with a stock volume of 723 cubic meters per hectare, three times higher than that of a typical forest of the same age, setting the highest stock volume record for Masson pine forests in the country.

    杉木
    福建南平县溪后乡和平社共有杉木林一千三百五十多公顷，平均每公顷蓄积量达六百立方公尺左右，创造全国杉木林大面积丰产纪录。在我国南方，一般杉木成林每公顷仅能产木材二百到三百立方公尺。
    和平社杉木林中有一片五十多亩三十八年生的杉木林，平均每公顷的蓄积量达一千一百七十四点五立方公尺，在国内数第一，世界上也少见。
    马尾松
    浙江省建德林场有一片三十多亩三十七年生的马尾松林，每公顷蓄积量达七百二十三立方公尺，比一般同龄林的蓄积量高三倍，是目前全国马尾松林蓄积量的最高纪录。
