　　Falling in Love with Mountain Areas, Falling in Love with Agricultural Labor
　　A Group of Young People from Shanghai and Hangzhou Settle Down in the Countryside
　　(Our Dispatch) Anhui Province recently welcomed a new group of young people from Shanghai. As of the beginning of this month, Shanghai has sent three groups of young people, totaling more than 2,000, to settle in Anhui. Before their arrival, the members of agricultural cooperatives and workers of farms in various places were busy cleaning houses, preparing beds and utensils, as if preparing for a joyous event, waiting for their arrival. In the province's famous tea production model cooperative, members arranged comfortable housing for the eight new members, prepared hoes and sickles for them, and added thermos bottles, kerosene lamps, foot basins, and bath basins, and also gave each person a packet of tea. Many young people from Shanghai have mastered various production techniques with the help of cooperative members. Six young people from Shanghai who settled in the Chi Hui Cooperative in Yi County learned six production techniques, such as water lifting and ramming, within a month. Chen Yunping, who settled in the Shancha Cooperative in She County, learned thirteen kinds of farm work in less than two months. Female youth Luo Heying settled in the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Yi County for only two or three months, and because of her active production and progressive thinking, she was recently honorably elected as a people's representative of the township and county.
　　While learning production, these educated youths also spread their cultural knowledge to the people in the mountainous areas. They not only sought production knowledge from the cooperative members, but also taught the cooperative members to read. Three young people who settled in the Lixiang Cooperative in Taiping County ran a people's school in the cooperative.
　　Many young people from Shanghai have fallen in love with the mountainous areas and agricultural labor. Some wrote letters to friends in Shanghai, mobilizing them to also come to the mountainous areas to settle down and produce, and some even plan to bring their parents to settle down in the mountainous areas.
　　(Our Dispatch) Two thousand eight hundred social youth in Hangzhou are settling down in the countryside with peace of mind, actively participating in agricultural production and various social tasks.
　　The social youth who went to the countryside to settle down this year are mostly educated youth who graduated from senior primary school, junior middle school, and senior middle school. They set off from late February this year and went to Tiantai, Ninghai, Xianju, Xiaoshan, and the suburbs of Hangzhou to settle down. They have a high enthusiasm in labor. Most of the 1,600 social youth who settled in the Sandun District in the suburbs of Hangzhou can share weal and woe with the old cooperative members, achieving the same food, same living, and same labor. Junior middle school graduate Wu Shaonan has a very firm will to participate in agricultural production, determined to realize the "thousand-jin cooperative" with the farmers. He has never been absent from work for more than a month since he went to the countryside. The masses reflected, "We welcome two thousand more people like this." Nine young people who participated in labor in the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Zhangshan Township, Tangqi District in the suburbs of the city, have learned various agricultural production technologies such as water lifting, digging the ground, digging water chestnuts, and dragging river mud under the care and help of the old cooperative members.
　　This group of young people who settled in the countryside not only actively participated in labor production, but also actively assisted agricultural cooperatives in doing various social tasks. Many new members of the Shangxi Cooperative in Anxi Township actively work during the day and become active members of social work at night. Some helped with the election work until dawn, some ran all over the cooperative to do statistics and comparisons, and most of the educated youth ran people's schools by team. Yan Yanqiu, a junior middle school graduate who was the first to settle in the agricultural cooperative, was elected as a township people's representative because he actively organized more than a dozen educated youths who went to the agricultural cooperative to settle down with him to eliminate illiteracy for the agricultural cooperative.

　　爱上了山区　爱上了农业劳动
    上海杭州一批青年在农村安家落户
    本报讯　安徽省最近又迎接了上海市新来的一批青年。到本月上旬止，上海市已有三批青年共二千多人来安徽安家落户了。每当他们到达之前，各地农业社的社员们、农场的工人们，都像办喜事一样地忙着打扫房屋，准备床铺、用具，等待着他们到来。全省著名的茶叶生产模范社，社员们为新来的八个社员安排了舒适的住房，为他们准备了锄头、镰刀，添置了热水瓶、煤油灯、洗脚盆、洗澡盆，还送给每人一包茶叶。很多上海青年在社员的帮助下，已掌握了多种生产技术。在黟县迟辉社落户的六个上海青年，在一个月内就学会了车水、打夯等六种生产技术。在歙县山岔社落户的陈云萍，不到两个月就会做十三种农活。女青年罗荷英到黟县星火农业社落户也不过两三个月，由于她生产积极、思想进步，最近已被光荣地选为乡和县的人民代表。
    这些知识青年在学习生产的同时，也把自己的文化知识传播给山区人民。他们一边向社员求教生产知识，一边教社员识字。在太平县里巷社落户的三个青年，就给社里办了一所民校。
    很多上海青年已爱上了山区，爱上了农业劳动。他们有的写信给上海的朋友，动员他们也来山区安家生产，有的还打算把父母接来山区落户。
    本报讯　杭州市二千八百多个社会青年安心在农村中安家落户，积极参加农业生产和各项社会工作。
    今年到农村中去落户的这些社会青年，绝大部分是高小、初中、高中毕业的知识青年。从今年2月下旬起先后出发到天台、宁海、仙居、肖山和杭州市郊区去安家落户，他们在劳动中，热情很高。在杭州市郊三墩区落户的一千六百个社会青年，大多数都能和老社员同甘共苦，做到同吃同住同劳动。初中毕业生吴绍南，参加农业生产的意志非常坚定，立志要和农民一起实现千斤社。下乡一个多月来从未缺过勤。群众反映，“像这种人来两千个我们也欢迎”。在市郊塘栖区獐山乡第二农业社参加劳动的九个小青年，在老社员的关怀帮助下，已经学会了车水、掘地、挖荸荠、拖河泥等各项农业生产技术。
    这批在农村安家落户的青年，不但积极参加了劳动生产，同时还积极协助农业社做好各项社会工作。安溪乡上溪社不少新社员白天积极劳动，晚上成了社会工作的积极分子。有的帮助搞选举工作直到通宵，有的跑遍全社搞统计、比高低，大部分知识青年以队为单位办起了民校。第一批到农业社落户的初中毕业生严艳秋，由于积极地把一同到农业社去落户的十多个知识青年组织起来，为农业社扫除文盲，因而被选为乡人民代表。
