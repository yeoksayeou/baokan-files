    The Tradition of Opera Representing Modern Life

    Since liberation, opera workers across the country have liberated their thinking and exerted great efforts. During the Great Leap Forward, they created and performed many excellent new dramas reflecting the current realities of struggle, which have been welcomed by the broad masses of the audience. However, a few people still hold reservations about opera portraying modern themes; they kindly worry that this will lose the tradition of opera. However, this joint performance of modern-themed operas not only proves that modern operas have inherited the tradition well and have had new developments, but also that modern operas themselves have their own traditions. Here, without mentioning the experience gained from performing modern operas in the nine years after the national liberation, simply providing some historical data on the following types of operas can prove this.

    Henan Opera (also known as Henan Bangzi) is the main local opera form in Henan Province and is also a fairly ancient opera genre. Everyone knows that Henan Opera has many excellent classical traditional plays, but around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, it had already begun to perform plays reflecting the social life of the time, such as "Qi Widow Rebels," "Killing Seven People," and "Dissecting the Abdomen to Verify the Flower." Around the time of the Great Revolution, it also performed plays such as "Cai E's Divorce," "Shooting Cai Gongshi," and "South Manchuria Road." Although these plays reflected the people's wishes and loves and hates at the time, they also had the error of promoting the ruling class's "benevolent governance." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, "Old Bao Judges Japan," performed in northern Henan, reflected the people's strong anti-Japanese sentiments at the time.

    Shanghai Opera is a local opera popular in southern Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Wuhu. In the traditional repertoire of Shanghai Opera, "Meeting at the Nunnery" and "Lu Yachen" were written based on actual events at the time. Before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large number of people engaged in "civilized drama" participated in the Shanghai Opera circles, bringing with them a batch of plays, such as "Blood Road," which reflected the miserable lives of the working people at the time and their resistance to exploitation. In addition, plays such as "Divorce Case" and "Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong" were also written based on social news at the time.

    Min Opera only originated in the Fuzhou language area three hundred years ago. It is a mixture of "Confucian Scholars," "Jianghu," and "Pingjiang" from the late Ming Dynasty to the mid-Qing Dynasty. On the eve of the Xinhai Revolution, the people of Fuzhou, under the call of Sun Daoren, launched an uprising, defeated the Qing army in one battle, and ended the Qing Dynasty's rule. This current event was compiled by "Sanxiaxiang" performers into "Sun Daoren Beats the Qing General" for performance. Since the Xinhai Revolution, Min Opera artists have compiled and performed many current affairs dramas, including "Lin Zexu" and "Cai Songpo."

    Chu Opera, formerly known as Flower Drum Opera, originated in rural Hubei and developed from the mountain songs and folk tunes sung by the working people in the fields during their farming leisure. Therefore, its content mostly expresses the farmers' own lives and hopes, and its form is lively. During the Great Revolution, under the leadership of the Party, realistic plays such as "Fei Gongzhi," "Returning South," and "Mid-Autumn Moon Cake" were compiled and performed to expose the decadent life of the old society. In 1932, it was forced to stop performing due to the performance of "Country Bumpkin," which exposed the Kuomintang's decadent politics. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, some people in the Chu Opera circles, under the leadership of Guo Moruo and Tian Han, formed propaganda teams to perform anti-Japanese short plays, such as "Those with Strength Contribute Strength" and "Great Victory in Northern Hunan," which greatly encouraged the audience.

    Hunan Flower Drum Opera, like Chu Opera, is a local life drama with a strong local flavor, suitable for reflecting real life. Traditional plays such as "Pulling Radish Greens," "Begging for Tuition," and "Baozheng Urging Grain" all reflected the people's life and struggle before liberation in a timely manner. (Lan)

### 戏曲表现现代生活的传统

    戏曲表现现代生活的传统
    全国各地许多戏曲工作者解放了思想，鼓足干劲，在大跃进中创作和演出了不少优秀的反映当前现实斗争生活的新剧目，受到了广大观众的欢迎。但至今仍有少数人对戏曲表现现代题材抱着保留态度；他们好心地担心这样会丢掉戏曲传统。但从这次现代题材戏曲联合公演中，不仅证明了现代戏已经很好地继承了传统，并有了新的发展。而且，现代戏本身也是有它自己的传统的。这里先不说全国解放后，九年来演出现代戏所获得的经验，只简单地就下列几个剧种，提供一些历史资料便可证明。
    豫剧（即河南梆子）是河南省主要的地方戏曲形式，也是一个相当古老的剧种。大家都知道豫剧有很多优秀的古典传统剧目，但它在辛亥革命前后，即已开始演出反映当时社会生活的“齐寡妇造反”、“杀七口”、“剖腹验花”等剧。大革命前后也曾演出“蔡锷离婚”、“枪杀蔡公时”、“南满路”等剧，这些剧目虽然反映了当时人民的愿望和爱憎，但也有宣扬了统治阶级“德政”的错误。到了抗日战争时期，豫北地区演出的“老包铡日本”等，更是反映了当时人民强烈的抗日情绪。
    沪剧是流行于苏南杭州、嘉兴、芜湖一带的地方戏。在沪剧传统剧目中的“庵堂相会”“陆雅臣”等便是采取当时当地的实事编写的。抗日战争爆发之前，因为有一大批搞文明戏的人参加到沪剧界，带去了一批剧目，其中如“血路”等就是反映当时劳动人民过着悲惨生活，起来反抗剥削的戏。此外，如“离婚案”“黄慧如与陆根荣”等剧也是采取当时的社会新闻编写的。
    闽剧三百年前才发源于福州语系地区。它是混合了明末到清中叶的“儒林”“江湖”“平讲”等形成的。辛亥革命前夕，福州人民在孙道仁的号召下起义，一战打垮了清军，结束了清朝统治。这个时事便曾被“三下响”艺人编成“孙道（仁）打（清）将军”演出。辛亥革命以来，闽剧艺人编演了许多时事戏，其中如“林则徐”“蔡松坡”等都是。
    楚剧原名花鼓戏，发源于湖北农村，是劳动人民耕余时，在田间歌唱的山歌小调发展形成的。因此，它的内容多是表现农民自己的生活和希望，形式活泼。大革命时期，在党的领导下，曾编演“费公智”“南归”“中秋画饼”等暴露旧社会腐朽生活的现实剧目。1932年因演出“乡巴佬”揭露国民党的腐朽政治，曾被迫停演。抗日战争时期，楚剧界一部分人在郭沫若、田汉等的领导下，组成宣传队演出抗日小戏，如“有力出力”“湘北大捷”等，给与观众很大鼓舞。
    湖南花鼓戏和楚剧一样，同是地方生活小戏，生活气息浓厚，适于反映现实生活。传统剧目中如“扯萝卜菜”“讨学钱”“保正催粮”等都是及时反映解放前人民生活和斗争的。　　　　（兰）
