　　Establish a Boldly Innovative and Fully Collaborative Communist Style
    All for the Benefit of Patients
    The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army Presents a New Scene of Blooming Flowers Everywhere
    (Our dispatch) Reporters Yan Wu and Ye Feng report: In this rectification movement, the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with politics in command, launched an ideological remolding movement for intellectuals with the rectification of medical style as the "key link," thoroughly criticizing and discrediting bourgeois medical ideas and practices such as "loving disease but not patients" and "using patients to practice skills." Among medical personnel, it clarified the medical ideology of "all for the benefit of patients," and established a socialist style of bold innovation and comprehensive collaboration in medical work, presenting a new scene of blooming flowers everywhere.
    Some medical personnel who "couldn't love" patients have developed a high degree of class sympathy for the sick and wounded due to their enhanced political awareness in this rectification movement. "Treating patients as relatives" and "thinking about reducing the pain of patients in every way" have become the action guidelines for these red medical workers. Military doctor Feng Yike exhausted her mind and devoted many days and nights of hard work to save a critically ill patient. Her mood changed day and night with the patient's condition. When the patient's phlegm blocked the throat, breathing was extremely difficult, and all methods of suctioning phlegm were ineffective, she anxiously disregarded her own health and sucked out the patient's phlegm with her mouth, rescuing the patient from suffocation. Recently, a pregnant woman seven months along came to the hospital because of the deterioration of her high blood pressure. In the past, doctors would have performed a surgical abortion on the pregnant woman according to "routine." Now, in order to avoid the pain of surgical abortion for the patient and to ensure the survival of the fetus, the doctors changed to conservative treatment, observing the patient's condition day and night, trying every means to treat the pregnant woman's illness, and doing their best to protect the fetus, until the pregnant woman safely delivered.
    For the convenience of patients seeking medical treatment, the outpatient department implemented a "three-shift system," providing medical care as soon as patients arrive, whether day or night. For hospitalized patients, they achieve "welcoming upon admission and farewell upon discharge." The outpatient department also set up publicity duty officers, who proactively explain the hospital's rules, regulations, and matters that patients should pay attention to, so that patients can quickly enter a normal recuperation life after admission.
    In the past, errors in nursing care were often not taken seriously. Now, if someone gives a patient an extra biscuit or drinks half a glass less of water, even if these errors do not directly harm the patient, they are considered "remarkable" errors and are condemned by conscience and public opinion. A nurse felt bad for several days because she drew two milliliters of blood more than necessary when giving a patient a blood test. They also conscientiously implemented the system of "three checks (patient's name, bed number, and hospitalization number), five comparisons (size of medicine label, dosage, medicine name, and time), and four knowledges (diagnosis, treatment, nursing, and diet)," thoroughly eliminating the occurrence of errors and accidents.
    Previously, some medical personnel only cared about treating diseases and not about the patient's thoughts. Now they "treat both the disease and the person." For the sick and wounded who are unwilling to accept surgical treatment, the doctor will understand and dispel their ideological concerns, and never let the sick and wounded go to the operating table with ideological burdens. A patient couldn't sleep at night because her lover hadn't come to see her for many days, but she was unwilling to tell the doctor her concerns. The doctor and nurse went to the patient's home and organization to find out. It turned out that her lover couldn't spare time to see her because of official business. After the doctor told the patient about this situation, the patient's doubts were dispelled, and she recuperated peacefully from then on.
    "Taking the ward as home" and "bringing work to the patient's bedside" are the resounding slogans put forward by this hospital during the rectification of medical style. In the past, people felt anxious to go home before getting off work. Now, they devote their feelings and energy to the patients. So that patients not only receive physical treatment, but also receive spiritual comfort. The doctors and nurses of the pediatrics department also mend socks, sew pillows, tutor homework for sick children, or take sick children to the outdoors for walks and games, so that sick children can still enjoy "maternal love" and "family warmth" in the hospital. When a patient was admitted to the hospital for the second time, she pessimistically believed that she was a "hopeless person." This was her fourth hospitalization, but the doctors and nurses still came to comfort her as before: "We will treat you with the best technology, so please recuperate well!" Now the patient has become optimistic.
    Under the slogan of "everything is subordinate to treatment, everything starts from the convenience of patients," an unprecedented situation of medical collaboration has emerged in the hospital. In the past, disunity and non-cooperation often occurred between medical departments, between medical departments and auxiliary diagnostic departments, between business departments and administrative departments, and between doctors and nurses; nurses complained to doctors: "You just move your mouths and ask us to run our legs off." Doctors said that nurses did not cooperate with his medical treatment. The supply department said that the medical department was "difficult to serve." Now, as long as the needs of patients and medical treatment are mentioned, everyone rushes to do it. In the past, the work of auxiliary diagnosis and treatment departments and offices was to wait for people to "come to their door." Now, they take the initiative to go to the wards, and meet medical requirements and needs in all aspects. When encountering difficult and critical illnesses, they conduct preoperative discussions and preliminary diagnosis discussions to ensure correct medical treatment for patients.
    Not long ago, on a Sunday, the hospital received a patient, Zhang Zemin, who suffered from thrombocytopenic purpura and pregnancy anemia, and had symptoms of bleeding after admission. In order to rescue this patient, the entire hospital launched a tense "joint operation." When internal medicine treatment was ineffective, surgery followed by splenectomy. Shortly after the operation, the patient was about to give birth, and obstetrics then entered the "battle." In order to prevent the patient from dystocia, surgery again was ready to be a "reserve team" to prepare for surgery, and all people in the hospital with AB blood type went to the blood bank to donate blood in preparation for blood transfusion to the patient. Through the efforts of the entire hospital, the patient was finally turned from danger to safety, and mother and child were safe.
    In the past, they believed that medical errors were "unavoidable," but now they have many advanced units and individuals with "zero errors in a hundred days." Many "incurable diseases" that were thought to be incurable can now be cured. Before the rectification movement, internal medicine had a patient with fulminant dysentery who died due to ineffective treatment. Recently, another similar patient was sent, and the patient had a high fever of more than 42 degrees Celsius upon admission, and her life was in danger. But because they firmly believed: "We must save him!" After two days and nights of intense rescue, the patient was finally out of danger. Not long ago, a patient with malignant gastric cancer, after consultation with various departments, decided to perform abdominal resection. When the patient's abdomen was opened, it was found that the gastric cancer was adhered to the liver, but they had never performed liver resection surgery. To do it would be a great risk, and perhaps with a little error, the patient would die immediately. If the cancer was left in the abdomen, the patient could live for a few months at most. When they thought of the patient's long-term interests, they boldly performed the operation on the patient and finally cured the disease.
    No one has ever dared to put forward the slogan of "eliminating red lights" in nursing work. They not only put it forward, but also did it. In pediatrics, the phenomenon of "red buttocks" has now been 100% eliminated. Obstetrics creatively used "fetal aspirators," which have reduced the rate of perineal tears in pregnant women by 75%, reducing the pain of pregnant women.
    From their personal experiences, these medical workers found the red and expert road. Their slogan is: "Red in the ward, expert in the ward, the ward is the scene of our red and expert." In the process of curing patients, they exercise and improve their political awareness and professional level.
    Ding Ningsheng, a doctor in the Department of Neurology, once mistakenly believed that "clinical work hindered the improvement of theory," and regarded going deep into the ward as "tedious, troublesome, and a waste of time." Now, she goes deep into the ward, understands the patient's condition from patiently caring for the patient, which not only comforts the patient, but also enriches the basis of her diagnosis, and also learns a lot of medical knowledge that cannot be found in books.
    Huang Kegang, an old professor in his sixties and director of internal medicine, said to reporters: "What is the use of being an expert if a doctor does not serve patients? May I ask, how can you be a good doctor if you are separated from the patient and do not observe the cause and effect of the condition?"

　　树立大胆革新和全面协作的共产主义风格
    一切造福于病人
    解放军总医院到处呈现着百花争艳的新气象
    本报讯　记者阎吾、冶峰报道：中国人民解放军总医院在这次整风运动中，以政治作统帅，开展了一个以整顿医疗作风为“纲”的知识分子思想改造运动，搞透搞臭了“爱病不爱病人”、“拿病人练技术”等资产阶级医疗思想和医疗作风。在医务人员中明确了“一切造福于病人”的医疗思想，在医务工作中树立起大胆革新和全面大协作的社会主义风格，到处呈现着百花争艳的新气象。
    有些对病人“爱不起来”的医务人员，由于在这次整风运动中提高了政治觉悟，对伤病员已有了高度的阶级同情心。“把病人当作亲人”、“处处为减少病人的痛苦着想”，已成为他们——红色医务工作者的行动指南。军医冯意可为了挽救一个垂危的病人，她绞尽脑汁，付出了许多昼夜的辛勤劳动。她的心情日夜地随着病人的病情而变化。当病人的痰堵住了喉咙、呼吸万分困难而用一切办法抽痰无效时，她焦急得不顾自己的健康，用嘴吸出了病人的痰，把病人从窒息中抢救过来。最近，有一个妊娠七个月的产妇，因为高血压状恶化而来到医院，要是在从前，医生会按照“常规”给产妇进行手术流产。现在，医生们为了免除手术流产对病人的痛苦和胎儿的成活，就改用了保守疗法，日夜观察病人病情的变化，一面想尽办法治疗产妇的病，一面极力保护胎儿，一直坚持到产妇安全分娩。
    门诊部为了病人看病的方便，实行了“三班制”，不管白天或黑夜，病人随到随看。对住院的病人，做到“入院欢迎，出院欢送”。门诊部还设立了宣传值班员，主动地向病人讲解医院里的制度、规定和病人要注意的事项，使病人入院后很快就能进入正常的休养生活。
    过去护理上的差错，常常不被重视。现在谁要是给病人多吃了一块饼干或者少喝了半杯水，虽然这些差错对病人没有直接的危害，也认为是“了不起”的差错而受到良心和舆论的谴责。有一个护士在给病人验血时，因多抽了两毫升的血，难过了好几天。她们还认真贯彻了“三查（病人的姓名、床号和住院号）五对（大小药牌、剂量、药名和时间）和四知道（诊断、治疗、护理和饮食）”的制度，彻底消灭差错事故的发生。
    以前有些医务人员，只管治病而不管病人的思想，现在他们“治病又治人”。对于不愿接受手术医疗的伤病员，医生就了解和解除其思想顾虑，决不让伤病员背着思想包袱去开刀。有一个病人因为爱人多日没有来看她，她夜里睡不着，但又不肯把心事告诉医生，医生和护士就到病人的家里和机关里去了解。原来她爱人因公而抽不出时间来看她。医生把这个情况告诉了病人后，病人的疑虑解开了，从此安心地休养。
    “以病房为家”、“把工作作到病人的床沿上”是这个医院在整顿医疗作风时所提出的响亮口号。过去没等下班，人们就心慌慌地想回家。现在，他们都把自己的感情和精力用在病人身上。使病人不仅得到肉体上的治疗，而且也得到了精神上的安慰。儿科的大夫和护士们，还给病儿补袜子、缝枕头、补习功课或者领着病儿到室外散步、游戏，使病儿在医院里仍能享受到“母爱”和“家庭的温暖”。有一个病人在第二次入院时她就悲观地认为自己是“没有希望的人”。这次是她第四次住院，可是医生和护士们还像过去一样经常来安慰她：“我们拿最好的技术给你治疗，你好好休养吧！”现在病人已经乐观起来。
    在“一切服从于治疗、一切从便利于病人出发”的口号下，全院出现了空前未有的医疗大协作的局面。过去，医疗科与医疗科、医疗科与辅助诊疗科、业务部门与行政部门、医生和护士间常常发生一些不团结、不合作的现象；护士埋怨医生：“你们动动嘴，叫我们跑断腿”。医生就说护士不配合他的医疗。供应部门说医疗部门“难伺候”。现在，只要提到病人和医疗的需要，谁都争着干、抢着做。过去辅助诊疗科、室的工作都是等人家
  “找上门”，现在，他们主动地下病房，而且从各方面满足医疗上的要求和需要。在遇到疑难病情和危重病人时，他们认真地进行术前讨论和拟诊讨论，以保证对病人的正确医疗。
    在不久前的一个星期天，这个院接收了一个病人张责民，她患血小板减少性紫癜病和妊娠贫血，入院后又有出血的症候。为了抢救这个病人，全院投入了一场紧张的“联合作战”，当内科治疗无效后，外科接着就进行脾脏切除，手术进行不久，病人又要分娩，产科接着投入了“战斗”。为了防止病人难产，外科又作了“后备队”，作好手术上的准备，全院有AB型血型的人都到血库去献血，准备给病人输血。经过全院的努力，终于使病人转危为安、母子安全。
    过去他们认为医疗差错是“不可避免”的，现在他们已出现了许多“百日无差错”的先进单位和人物。许多过去认为“不治之症”，现在也能治好了。内科在整风运动前，有一个患暴发性痢疾的病人因治疗无效而死亡。最近，又有一个同样的病人被送来，病人在入院时已高烧到四十二度以上，眼看生命危急。但是由于他们坚信：“我们一定要治活他！”经过两昼夜地紧张抢救，终于使病人脱险。不久前，一个患恶性胃癌的病人，经过各科的会诊，决定进行破腹切除。当破开病人的肚子后，发现胃癌粘连在肝脏上，可是切除肝脏的手术，他们从来未作过。要作就要冒着很大危险，说不定有一点差错，病人就会立刻死去。要是把癌瘤留在肚里，病人最多能活几个月。当他们想到病人的长远利益的时候，就大胆地给病人作了手术，终于把病治好了。
    从来没有人敢在护理工作上提出“消灭红灯”的口号，他们不仅提出，而且也做到了。在儿科，现在已经百分之百地消灭了“臀红”现象。产科创造性地使用了“胎儿吸引器”，已使产妇的会阴撕裂率减少了75％，给产妇减少了痛苦。
    这些医务工作者从其亲身经历中，找到了红专道路。他们的口号是：“红在病房，专在病房，病房是我们红专的现场”。在为病人治好病的过程里，锻炼和提高他们的政治觉悟和业务水平。
    脑系科医生丁宁生曾一度错误地认为“作临床工作妨碍理论的提高”，把深入病房看成是“罗嗦、麻烦和浪费时间的事情”，现在她深入病房，从耐心照顾病人中了解病人的病情，既安慰了病人，又丰富了她诊断的根据，也学到许多书本上找不到的医学知识。
    年已花甲的老教授、内科主任黄克纲向记者说：“医生若不为病人服务，专而何用？试问脱离病人、不观察病情的前因后果，又怎么能做一个好医生呢？”
