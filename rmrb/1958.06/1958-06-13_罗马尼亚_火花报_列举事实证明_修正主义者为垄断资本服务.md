Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 11th: To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the nationalization in Romania, the "Spark" newspaper here published an editorial on the 11th, stating that Romania's experience once again proves the fundamental difference between socialist nationalization implemented by the working class who hold state power and the nationalization implemented by certain capitalist countries.

The editorial pointed out that nationalization in capitalist countries does not bring any changes to the capitalist economic structure and social relations, but is the most beneficial thing for monopoly capitalists. In Britain, due to the nationalization of coal mines, mine owners can receive 100 million pounds in remuneration each year. This kind of nationalization expands the income of capitalists, strengthens the exploitation of the working class, and has no socialist flavor at all.

The editorial said that reformists and revisionists believe that the bourgeois state is above society and serves the universal welfare. It treats workers and capitalists equally and alternately restricts workers and capitalists according to the needs of the situation. In addition, it will promote the emergence of socialist factors within state-monopoly capitalism. However, it is not difficult for people to see whose interests are served by those who put forward this theory. According to this theory, Mr. Dulles resigned from his position as chairman of the International Nickel Company and president of the Rockefeller Foundation to serve as Secretary of State, in order to restrict monopoly capital and take care of the birth of socialism in the United States!

The editorial, when introducing the great achievements made by Romania in the ten years since the implementation of nationalization, pointed out that the electricity, pig iron, and natural gas that Romanian socialist industry needed a year to produce in 1948 could be produced in three months in 1957. The output of oil, steel, and coal produced in more than four months in 1957, and the tractors produced in one and a half months, were equal to the annual output in 1948.

The editorial pointed out that Romania's experience confirms the correctness of the universal laws of building a new social system. The great achievements of Romania's socialist construction are due to the correct line implemented by the Party, which resolutely rejected the anti-Marxist theories of revisionism. Revisionists believe that socialism will develop spontaneously and oppose the organized activities and planned management of the socialist state in the economic field according to the principle of democratic centralism.

The editorial said that in the initial period of nationalization in our country, the "Voice of America," "Radio Free Europe," and Western newspapers once predicted that we would not be able to accomplish anything without their help. But ten years have passed, and the facts have proved that those gentlemen were wrong. The facts have proved that the working class manages enterprises much better than the bourgeoisie.

The editorial also talked about the fraternal cooperation of socialist countries, and pointed out that the achievements Romania has made in the implementation of nationalization are first and foremost inseparable from the all-round assistance of the Soviet Union.

### 罗马尼亚“火花报”列举事实证明  修正主义者为垄断资本服务

    罗马尼亚“火花报”列举事实证明
    修正主义者为垄断资本服务
    新华社布加勒斯特11日电　为纪念罗马尼亚实行国有化十周年，这里的“火花报”11日发表社论说：罗马尼亚的经验再一次证明了掌握国家政权的工人阶级所实行的社会主义国有化和某些资本主义国家所实行的国有化的根本不同。
    社论指出，资本主义国家的国有化没有给资本主义经济结构和社会关系带来任何变化，而是最有利于垄断资本家的事情。在英国，由于煤矿的国有化，矿主每年可以得到一亿英镑的酬金。这种国有化扩大了资本家的收入，加强了对工人阶级的剥削，没有丝毫社会主义气味。
    社论说，改良主义者和修正主义者认为，资产阶级国家是超于社会之上而为普遍的福利服务的，它对工人和资本家一视同仁，根据情况需要对工人和资本家轮流加以限制，此外还会促使在国家垄断资本主义内部产生社会主义因素。但是，人们不难看出，提出这种理论的人究竟是为谁的利益服务；根据这种理论，杜勒斯先生辞去国际镍公司董事长和洛克菲勒基金会主席的职务而担任国务卿，乃是为了限制垄断资本而照料社会主义在美国的诞生！
    社论在介绍罗马尼亚实行国有化十年来所取得的伟大成就时指出，罗马尼亚社会主义工业在1948年的时候需要用一年时间生产的电力、生铁和天然气，在1957年用三个月就能够生产出来，1957年四个多月里生产的石油、钢和煤炭，一个半月生产的拖拉机，就等于1948年一年的产量。
    社论指出，罗马尼亚的经验证实了建设新社会制度的普遍规律的正确性。罗马尼亚社会主义建设之所以取得巨大成就是由于党所实行的正确路线，它坚决拒绝了修正主义的反马克思主义理论；修正主义者认为社会主义会自发地发展而反对社会主义的国家在经济方面根据民主集中制原则进行有组织的活动和计划管理。
    社论说，在我国国有化的最初时期，“美国之音”、“自由欧洲”电台和西方的报刊曾经预言，没有他们的帮助我们什么也做不成。但是十年过去了，事实证明，那些先生们看错了。事实证明工人阶级把企业管理得比资产阶级好得多。
    社论还谈到社会主义国家的兄弟合作，并且指出，罗马尼亚在实行国有化中取得的成就首先是同苏联的多方面援助分不开的。
