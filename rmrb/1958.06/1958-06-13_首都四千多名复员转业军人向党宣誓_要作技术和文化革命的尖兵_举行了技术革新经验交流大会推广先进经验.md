Xinhua News Agency, 12th — Demobilized and transferred soldiers in Beijing held a technical innovation experience exchange conference today, and in the evening, a mobilization rally for technical and cultural revolutions was held.

More than 800 people, including technical innovation experts, advanced producers, advanced workers, and responsible persons from various provinces and cities who came to Beijing to participate in the Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference, attended the technical innovation experience exchange conference held during the day. Five demobilized and transferred soldiers introduced their daring and proactive deeds in technical innovation at the meeting. Mu Rulian, a demobilized soldier of the electrician group of the repair shop of the North China Metal Structure Factory, reported on behalf of the entire group of seventeen demobilized soldiers the process of successfully modifying a three-phase 380-volt 500 kVA transformer. The factory's production tasks have increased this year, and the original transformer is no longer suitable. If it were sent to a transformer factory for modification, it would not only take half a year but also cost more than 17,000 yuan. After repeated research, all the demobilized soldiers in the electrician group proposed to modify it themselves. They learned while doing, gave play to collective wisdom, overcame difficulties, worked hard for forty-five days, and with the help of experienced workers, completed the modification task sixteen days ahead of schedule, using only more than 7,000 yuan. Mi Boxian, a demobilized soldier from the Beijing Transportation Company's automobile repair shop, only had two and a half years of primary school education. Under the cultivation of the Party and the help of the workers, he had created and improved twenty-eight production tools in the past. In the past month or so, he has created and improved twenty more production tools. Among them, the "bent steel plate spring U-shaped bolt" can increase production efficiency by eighty times. Shen Fengchi, a fitter and disabled soldier from the China Plumbing Factory, Chen Xiaozhi, a technician and transferred soldier from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and others also introduced their bold creative deeds.

Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, carefully viewed the Beijing Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers Technical Innovation Exhibition in the morning and spoke at the conference in the afternoon. He encouraged everyone to continue to be bold in innovation and make more achievements in building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Feng Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, hoped in his speech that everyone would set off a upsurge in learning culture, technology, and science, and work with the people of the city to strive to build the capital into a modern industrial base within five years.

At the Beijing Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers Technical Revolution and Cultural Revolution Mobilization Rally held in the evening, the representatives of more than 4,000 demobilized and transferred soldiers took an oath to the Party, expressing their determination to break superstitions, liberate their minds, work hard and practically, not fear difficulties, and serve as pioneers of the technical and cultural revolutions in the technical revolution and cultural revolution movement. They pledged to hold high the red flag of the general line and contribute all their strength to the construction of the motherland and the capital.

    新华社12日讯　北京市的复员转业军人今天举行了技术革新经验交流大会，晚上又举行了技术革命和文化革命誓师大会。
    来自工厂、企业、机关和学校等单位的复员转业军人技术革新者、先进生产者、先进工作者和来北京参加全国第四次民政会议的各省、市负责人共八百多人，参加了在白天举行的技术革新经验交流大会。五名复员转业军人在会上介绍了他们在技术革新方面敢想敢干的事迹。华北金属结构厂修配车间电工组复员军人穆如连代表全组十七名复员军人报告了他们改装成功一台三相三八○伏特五○○千伏安变压器的经过。这个厂今年的生产任务增大，原有的变压器已不适用，如果拿到变压器制造厂去改装，不但需要半年时间，还需一万七千多元。电工组全体复员军人经过反复研究，提出由自己来改装。他们边做边学，发挥集体智慧，克服困难，苦战四十五天，在老师傅的帮助下，只用了七千多元，提前十六天，完成了改装任务。北京市运输公司汽车修理厂复员军人糜伯先只上过两年半小学，他在党的培养和工人们的帮助下，过去曾创造和改进了二十八件生产工具。最近一个多月来，他又创造和改进了二十件生产工具。其中“弯钢板弹簧凵型螺拴”能提高生产效率八十倍。中国水暖厂钳工、残废军人沈凤池、北京航空学院技术员、转业军人陈效智等也介绍了他们大胆创造的事迹。
    内务部部长谢觉哉上午仔细地观看了北京市复员转业军人技术革新展览会，下午在大会上讲了话。他勉励大家继续大胆创造，为多快好省地建设社会主义做出更多的成绩。北京市副市长冯基平在讲话中希望大家掀起一个学文化、学技术、学科学的热潮，和全市人民一道，为争取在五年内把首都建成为现代化工业基地而努力。
    在晚上举行的北京市复员转业军人技术革命和文化革命誓师大会上，四千多复员转业军人的代表向党宣誓，表示要在技术革命和文化革命运动中，破除迷信，解放思想，实干苦干，不怕困难，作技术和文化革命的尖兵，高举总路线的红旗，为建设祖国和首都而贡献自己的全部力量。
