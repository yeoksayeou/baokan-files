    Fengtai Creates Simplified Railroad Switch
    Increases Speed, Saves Steel

    Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The track maintenance workers of the Fengtai Engineering Section of the Beijing Railway Administration, based on the bold ideas of Youth League member Wang Yushu, and through collective wisdom and four days and nights of hard work, successfully created a simplified railroad switch. This simplified switch was recently laid at Fengtai Station and on the main line of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. Test runs have proven its effectiveness is very good. Relevant scientific research personnel and engineering technicians from the Ministry of Railways unanimously believe that it has many advantages and is worthy of widespread promotion. Lü Zhengcao, Vice Minister of Railways, happily said after seeing the application of this new switch: "This is the correct direction for improving switches, it's a revolution."

    A railroad switch is a device needed for a train to move from one track to an adjacent track. The switches currently used on China's railways have a relatively complex structure and certain weaknesses. Train movement is wobbly and vibrates, steel rails and wheels wear out quickly, requiring frequent repairs, and trains must reduce speed when passing through. The simplified switch, now made based on Wang Yushu's initiative, fundamentally eliminates the above shortcomings. At the same time, because of its simple construction, this switch does not require complicated design and centralized production, and local factories can also manufacture it in large quantities. Manufacturing this switch can also greatly save steel. It is calculated that each set of simplified switches can save 20 meters of steel rail; based on an average of one set of switches per kilometer, more than 10,000 tons of steel can be saved for every 10,000 kilometers of railway.

    The Ministry of Railways has decided to organize relevant technical personnel to conduct joint research with workers on site to further improve it on the existing basis, so as to promote it universally.

### 丰台创制简易道岔  提高了速度　节约了钢材

    丰台创制简易道岔
    提高了速度　节约了钢材
    新华社24日讯　北京铁路管理局丰台工务段的养路工人们，根据青年团员王玉书的大胆设想，发挥集体智慧，苦战四天四夜创造成功一种简化铁路道岔。这种简化道岔，最近铺在丰台车站和京广铁路正线上，试车证明效果很好，铁道部有关的科学研究人员和工程技术人员一致认为它有很多优点，值得普遍推广。铁道部副部长吕正操看了这种新道岔的运用情况以后高兴地说：“这是改进道岔的正确方向，是个革命。”
    道岔是火车从一条线驶入相邻的另一条线需要的设备。目前我国铁路上采用的道岔，结构比较复杂，又有某些弱点，行车摇摆振动，钢轨车轮磨损较快，需要经常补修，列车通过必须降低速度。现在根据王玉书的倡议而制成的简化道岔，从根本上消除了以上的缺点。同时，这种道岔由于构造简单，不需要繁琐的设计和集中生产，地方工厂也能大量制造。制造这种道岔，还能大大节约钢材。据计算，每组简化道岔可以节约二十公尺长的钢轨；按每公里平均有一组道岔估计，每一万公里铁路能节约钢材一万吨以上。
    铁道部已决定组织有关技术人员，到现场跟工人共同研究，在现有基础上进一步改进，以便普遍推广。
