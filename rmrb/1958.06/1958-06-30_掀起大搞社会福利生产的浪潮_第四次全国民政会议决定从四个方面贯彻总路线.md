Xinhua News Agency, June 29th. The Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference convened by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on May 26th concluded victoriously on the 18th.

The conference, using the spirit of moving from the abstract to the concrete, from the concrete to the abstract, breaking down superstitions, and liberating thought, reviewed past work, exchanged advanced experiences, and discussed and resolved the issue of how to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction in various civil affairs tasks.

The conference first assessed the new situation in civil affairs work brought about by the Great Leap Forward in production. The conference believed that in the past six months or so, civil affairs work has been leaping forward at an incredible pace. Currently, a wave of large-scale social welfare production has been launched across the country. According to statistics from January to April this year, twenty-three provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have newly established more than 5,700 social welfare production units. The rapid development of social welfare production units in these months has increased the number of social welfare production units established nationwide in the past few years by more than 95%. Many cities, through half a month of hard work or a few days of intense effort, have organized all those who can participate in production from among the recipients of preferential treatment and social relief to participate in social welfare production. Some cities have already achieved complete self-sufficiency in preferential treatment and social relief funds through organizing production. There have also been great achievements in disaster relief work. People in disaster areas have stable lives and are full of enthusiasm for production. Many areas have eliminated the spring famine ahead of schedule. For example, in the years since liberation, the average spring famine population accounted for 80% of the previous year's disaster-affected population, while this year's spring famine population accounted for only 25% of last year's disaster-affected population. These leap forward situations show that disaster relief work has broken the conventions of previous years. In addition, the broad masses of civil affairs work recipients have been mobilized, and their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction is unprecedentedly high. Families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, and demobilized soldiers have become an active force in the Great Leap Forward in production. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of civil affairs cadres has been aroused, and the past anxiety and negative emotions in their work have been basically overcome. The conference pointed out that the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in civil affairs work shows that civil affairs work has played an important role in promoting socialist construction.

Based on the Party's general line for socialist construction and the new situation of the leap forward in national civil affairs work, the conference put forward four aspects of opinions on how to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction in civil affairs work: First, to enable civil affairs work to fully play its role in encouraging 600 million people to selflessly defend socialism and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way; Second, to mobilize and organize families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, disaster victims, and the poor, to exert all their strength, strive for the top, and make the greatest contribution to building socialism; Third, to ensure that civil affairs work truly embodies the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people and promotes the development of socialist ownership and social productive forces; Fourth, to ensure that all civil affairs work starts from production and serves production.

The conference put forward specific requirements for these four aspects of opinions. In the first aspect, it required civil affairs departments in various regions to further improve preferential treatment and demobilization work, so that soldiers would not worry about their families and their future, exert all their strength, strive for the top, consolidate national defense, and protect the 600 million people in building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way; it also required them to do a good job in disaster relief and social relief work, so that 600 million people would not worry about their tomorrow and their old age, exert all their strength, strive for the top, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. The conference pointed out that this is the main starting point and purpose of preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief work. Leaving it and simply providing preferential treatment for the sake of preferential treatment and relief for the sake of relief will make these tasks lose their political significance. In the second aspect, the conference required civil affairs departments in various regions to mobilize and organize families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, disaster victims, and the poor to fully participate in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the technical revolution, and the cultural revolution through various political measures. For the elderly, the weak, the semi-able-bodied, and the disabled among them who have only part of their labor capacity, it is necessary to use science and technology and other material forces to create conditions for them to participate in socialist construction, so that they can also participate in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the technical revolution, and the cultural revolution. When discussing how civil affairs work should truly embody the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people, the conference pointed out that in civil affairs work, a considerable part of the workload is to help a portion of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, demobilized soldiers, disabled soldiers, and the poor who have lost their labor capacity or lack labor capacity to solve their living difficulties. This is a problem of the distribution of consumer goods. Dealing with this problem often involves the relationship between this part of the people and 600 million people. When dealing with this aspect of the problem, it is necessary to take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual in accordance with the spirit of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and at the same time, it must be conducive to consolidating and developing socialist ownership and conducive to developing social productive forces. When discussing the fourth aspect of the opinion, the conference cited a large number of facts to prove that as long as civil affairs work starts from production and serves production, civil affairs work can be lively, proactive, and free.

When discussing how to strengthen the Party's leadership in civil affairs work, the conference seriously criticized the phenomenon of some places waiting for the Party's leadership in the past. The conference believed that it was right for some civil affairs departments in the past to strengthen the system of requesting instructions and reporting to the Party, which is an important aspect of ensuring the Party's leadership over civil affairs work. However, it is not enough for some places to understand obeying the Party's leadership only as requesting instructions and reporting to the Party. It is necessary to plant the red flag of the Party's general line throughout all civil affairs work as the commander of all civil affairs work; it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's policies on civil affairs work in all civil affairs work; it is necessary to take the high-speed development of production as a red line running through all civil affairs work; it is necessary to regard the Party's central tasks in various periods as its own tasks, arrange its work around it, and serve it, and not carry out its own work in isolation. Only in this way can civil affairs work be completely placed under the leadership of the Party and play its due role in promoting the Party's entire cause.

The conference also discussed issues in civil affairs work such as strengthening ideological and political work, vigorously organizing social security welfare production, improving preferential treatment work, further developing social welfare undertakings, and disaster relief work must serve the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the elimination of natural disasters. The conference believed that the main task of demobilization work in the future is to do a good job in the political mobilization of demobilized soldiers, so that they can become revolutionaries and promoters who never fade, and play a shock role in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the technical revolution, and the cultural revolution. The conference required all cities and towns to organize all relief recipients and socially disabled people with some labor capacity into social welfare production in 1958, and achieve self-sufficiency in preferential treatment and relief subsidies in 1959, realizing a city without the poor. In rural areas, it is also necessary to organize social welfare production and promote the experience of centralized production and education for "five guarantees" households. The conference proposed to gradually establish medical labor appraisal work for those who are disabled due to illness and should enjoy disability pensions, scientific research work in the prosthesis industry, and carry out vocational training work for the disabled to create conditions for the disabled to participate in socialist construction. In production and disaster relief work, the conference criticized the simple relief viewpoint and summarized the correct production and disaster relief policy implemented by various regions as: "Prevention is more important than relief, combining prevention and relief, relying on the collective, focusing on agriculture, taking into account sideline industries, mutual cooperation, practicing strict economy, and eliminating disasters."

More than 400 people attended the conference, including representatives of 84 advanced units with good civil affairs work. On the last day of the conference, the Ministry of Internal Affairs presented each advanced unit with a banner. The representative of Yingju Agricultural Cooperative of Fengqiu County, Henan Province, recommended by Chairman Mao for its good work in production and disaster relief, was welcomed at the meeting.

    掀起大搞社会福利生产的浪潮
    第四次全国民政会议决定从四个方面贯彻总路线
    新华社29日讯　内务部5月26日召开的第四次全国民政会议在18日胜利结束。
    会议用以虚带实、逢实抽虚，破除迷信、解放思想的精神，检查了过去的工作，交流了先进的经验，讨论并解决了各项民政业务如何贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的问题。
    这次会议首先对民政工作在生产大跃进的推动下所出现的新形势作了估计。会议认为，最近半年多以来，民政工作是在一日千里地向前跃进。目前全国已掀起了大搞社会福利生产的浪潮。据今年1月到4月的统计，全国有二十三个省、市、自治区新建了社会福利生产单位五千七百多个。这几个月的社会福利生产单位的迅速发展，比几年来全国所建立的社会福利生产单位的数量增长了95％以上。许多城市苦干半月或者苦战几天就把优抚补助对象和社会救济对象中可以参加生产的人全部组织起来，参加社会福利生产，有些城市已经通过组织生产达到优抚补助和社会救济经费全部自给。在救灾工作方面，也有很大成绩。灾区人民生活安定，生产劲头十足，有许多地区提前消灭了春荒。如解放后几年来，平均春荒人口占前一年成灾人口80％，今年的春荒人口仅占去年成灾人口25％。这些跃进情况表明了救灾工作已打破历年的常规。另外，广大的民政工作对象已被发动起来，参加社会主义建设的积极性空前高涨，烈属、军属、复员军人已成为生产大跃进中一支活跃的力量。广大民政干部的干劲已鼓起来了，部分民政干部过去存在的不安心的情况和工作上的消极情绪已基本上克服。会议指出，民政工作大跃进的新形势，显示了民政工作对社会主义建设起了重要的促进作用。
    会议根据党的社会主义建设总路线和全国民政工作跃进的新形势，对在民政工作中如何贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线提出四个方面的意见：一、要使民政工作充分发挥鼓舞六亿人民忘我地保卫社会主义、多快好省地建设社会主义的作用；二、要发动和组织烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、灾民、贫民等，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为建设社会主义作出最大的贡献；三、要使民政工作切实体现正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，促进社会主义所有制和社会生产力的发展；四、要使各项民政工作从生产出发，为生产服务。
    会议对这四个方面的意见提出了具体要求。在第一个意见方面，要求各地民政部门必须进一步做好优抚、复员工作，使军人不为自己的家庭和将来担忧，鼓足干劲，力争上游，巩固国防，保卫六亿人民多快好省地建设社会主义；还要做好救灾和社会救济工作，使六亿人民不为自己的明天和晚年担忧，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。会议指出，这就是优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济工作的主要出发点和目的，离开它而单纯地为优待而优待，为救济而救济，就会使这些工作失掉政治意义。在第二个意见方面，会议要求各地民政部门要通过各种政治措施，发动和组织烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、灾民、贫民全部投入到工农业生产大跃进、技术革命和文化革命的高潮中来，对其中只有一部分劳动能力的老弱半劳动力和残废者，要利用科学技术和其他物质力量，为他们创造参加社会主义建设的条件，使他们也能够投入到工农业生产大跃进、技术革命和文化革命的高潮中。会议在讨论民政工作切实体现正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针时指出，在民政工作中，有相当大的一部分工作量，是帮助烈属、军属、复员军人、残废军人、贫民中一部分丧失劳动力或缺乏劳动力的人解决生活困难问题，这是一个消费资料的分配问题，处理这个问题，往往涉及到这一部分人和六亿人民之间的关系，在处理这方面问题的时候，必须根据正确处理人民内部矛盾的精神，兼顾国家、集体和个人三方面的利益，同时必须有利于巩固和发展社会主义所有制，有利于发展社会生产力。会议在讨论第四方面的意见时举出大量事实证明，民政工作只要从生产出发，为生产服务，就可以使民政工作生动活泼，主动自如。
    会议在讨论民政工作如何加强党的领导问题时，严肃地批判了有些地方过去存在的某些等待党的领导的现象。会议认为，过去有些民政部门加强了向党的请示报告制度，这是对的，这是保证党对民政工作的领导的一个重要方面。但是，有些地方把服从党的领导，仅仅理解为向党请示报告，是不够的，必须把党的总路线这面红旗插遍各项民政工作，作为各项民政工作的统帅；必须把党的有关民政工作的方针政策，正确地贯彻到各项民政工作中去；必须把高速度地发展生产，作为贯穿各项民政工作的一条红线；必须把党在各个时期的中心任务看作是自己的任务，围绕它安排自己的工作，并为它服务，而不能孤立地进行自己的工作。只有这样，才能使民政工作完全置于党的领导之下，在党的整个事业中发挥自己应有的促进作用。
    会议还就加强思想政治工作和大力组织社会保障性的福利生产，改进优抚工作、进一步开展社会福利事业，救灾工作必须为农业生产大跃进和消灭自然灾害服务等民政业务方面的问题进行了讨论。会议认为，今后复员工作的主要任务是做好对复员军人的政治鼓动工作，使他们成为永不褪色的革命派和促进派，在工农业生产大跃进、技术革命和文化革命中发挥突击作用。会议要求各地城镇在1958年内要把凡有一部分劳动能力的救济补助对象和社会残废者全部组织到社会福利生产中来，1959年达到优抚救济补助费自给有余，实现城镇无贫民。在农村也要组织社会福利生产，并推广“五保”户集中生产教养的经验。会议提出要逐步建立对于因病致残而应享受残废抚恤的医务劳动鉴定工作和假肢工业科学研究工作，开展残废者职业训练工作，为残废者创造参加社会主义建设的条件。在生产救灾工作上，会议批判了单纯救济观点，总结了各地执行的正确的生产救灾方针是：“防重于救，防救结合，依靠集体，农业为主，兼顾副业，互相协作，厉行节约，消灭灾荒”。
    参加会议的有四百多人，其中有八十四个民政工作做得好的先进单位的代表。在会议的最后一天，内务部赠给每个先进单位一面锦旗。毛主席推荐的生产救灾工作做得好的河南省封丘县应举农业社的代表在会上受到大家的欢迎。
