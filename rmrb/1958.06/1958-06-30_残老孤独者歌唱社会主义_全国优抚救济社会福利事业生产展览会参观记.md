The songs praising "Socialism is good, the Communist Party is good" come from all corners of the motherland, from workers, farmers, intellectuals, from young and healthy people, and also from the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and sick.

The National Exhibition of Special Care, Relief, Social Welfare, and Production, organized by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, tells visitors that there are currently 450 children's homes and homes for the disabled and elderly across the country. In the old society, elderly people who lost their ability to work and had no one to rely on could only wander, beg, and freeze in their old age. Now, in our socialist motherland, poor and helpless old people no longer need to worry about their later years. They live a stable and happy life in homes for the disabled and elderly.

In the old society, orphaned children could be seen everywhere on the streets. They were lonely, hungry, and suffered a miserable, bleak childhood. However, the situation is completely different now. Orphans have warm homes and happy childhoods. Children's homes are the homes of orphans and their schools. For the healthy growth of children, children's homes have full-time caregivers, medical equipment, and regular physical examinations for children. Within the children's homes, school-age children are educated according to the curriculum of ordinary primary schools, and graduates can also enter middle school. There are also rich cultural and recreational activities in the children's homes, and some have even formed theatrical troupes. One such troupe is the children's Henan Opera troupe from the Henan Province Children's Home, which is currently performing in Beijing.

These children sang with gratitude:

	"The ancient tree blooms for a thousand years,
	Wandering orphans have a home,
	The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are their own parents,
	The orphanage theater troupe is their warm home."

The exhibition also tells people that since liberation, the state has allocated more than 56 million yuan for capital construction, building 24 sanatoriums, 11 convalescent homes, and 10 schools for disabled veterans. The Revolutionary Disabled Veterans School is responsible for raising the educational level of veterans with minor disabilities to the junior high school level, and then sending them to participate in industrial and agricultural production and other work, or sending them to other schools for further study. Some of the state-established disabled veterans' sanatoriums are located in scenic areas. The sanatoriums are well-equipped for learning, recreation, and sports. Du Shuangquan, a first-class disabled veteran from the Sichuan Province Revolutionary Disabled Veterans Sanatorium who had his right hand and right foot amputated, wrote a rhythmic poem calling the sanatorium a "Veteran's Paradise." In this poem, he described the beautiful environment of the sanatorium with "clusters of green forests" and the pleasant recreational life arranged by the sanatorium for disabled veterans, including "basketball courts, volleyball courts, dance floors, dairy farms, and goat farms—all for the health of our comrades."

The socialist system has also brought happiness to blind and deaf-mute people who were abandoned or regarded as useless in the old society. China has 1.3 million deaf-mute people and 1.6 million blind people. They have all ended their miserable fates, received the care of the Party and the government, and obtained the same social status, labor, and learning opportunities as healthy people. Since liberation, the welfare of blind and deaf-mute people in China has greatly developed. At present, there are 23 production units for deaf-mute people, 70 schools for the deaf-mute, one secondary technical school for the deaf-mute, and four deaf-mute clubs across the country. There are 85 production units for the blind and 19 schools for blind children. Now, some places have organized all blind and deaf-mute people with labor ability to participate in production, and most other areas plan to organize all blind and deaf-mute people with labor ability to participate in production this year. Deaf-mute and blind people have gained new lives and are also singing the praises of socialism. A student from the Changsha School for the Blind and Deaf wrote a poem expressing his desire to sing the praises of socialism and Chairman Mao. The poem says:

	"A little bird out of its cage,
	How can it not sing?
	A Begonia flower gets rainwater,
	How can it not bloom exuberantly?
	I left the dark abyss,
	How can I not be grateful to the savior?
	The savior is Chairman Mao,
	This kindness is higher than the mountains and deeper than the water."

In the Shanghai team promoting the general line of socialist construction, there is a propaganda team composed of more than 30 blind people. They performed more than ten programs such as national music and Yue opera on the streets. Their programs include songs praising the general line and praising the new life of blind people. They said: "The general line illuminates the blind, and we must sing and promote it."

The ideal of "the elderly are provided for, the strong are employed, the young are cared for, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and sick are all supported" has been realized in our era. With the development of socialist ownership and social productive forces, their lives will get better day by day. Compared with their past miserable lives, how can they not sing the praises?

### 残老孤独者歌唱社会主义——全国优抚救济社会福利事业生产展览会参观记

    残老孤独者歌唱社会主义
    ——全国优抚救济社会福利事业生产展览会参观记
    本报记者　王濯非　朱敏之
    社会主义好、共产党好的歌声，来自祖国四面八方，来自工人、农民、知识分子，来自青年人和健壮的人，也来自鳏寡孤独废疾者。
    内务部举办的全国优抚救济社会福利事业生产展览会告诉观众：目前全国共有儿童教养院、残老教养院四百五十所。在旧社会，丧失了劳动能力而又无依无靠的老人，晚年的生活只有流浪、乞讨和冻饿。现在，在我们社会主义的祖国，贫苦无依的老人再也用不着为他们的晚年担忧了，他们在残老教养院里过着安定的幸福生活。
    在旧社会到处可以看到流落在街头的孤儿，他们孤苦伶仃，忍饥受饿，过着悲惨的、暗淡无光的童年。但是，现在情况完全不同了，孤儿们有了温暖的家，也有了欢乐幸福的童年。儿童教养院就是孤儿的家，也是孤儿的学校。为了儿童健康的成长，儿童教养院设有专职的护理人员，有医药设备，还定期为儿童检查身体。在儿童教养院内，对学龄儿童按照普通小学课程进行教育，小学毕业还可以进中学。在儿童教养院内也有丰富的文化娱乐活动，有的还组成了剧团。正在北京演出的河南省儿童教养院的一个童声豫剧团，就是其中的一个。
    这些孩子们满怀感激之情地唱道：
    “千年古树开了花，
    流浪孤儿有了家，
    共产党毛主席就是自己的亲父母，
    教养院剧团，就是自己温暖的家。”
    展览会还告诉人们，解放以来，国家共拨出基建费五千六百多万元，为残废军人修建教养院二十四所、疗养院十一所、学校十所。革命残废军人学校负责把有轻微残废的文化水平低的军人，提高到初中水平，然后再分别送他们参加工农业生产和其他各项工作，或送他们到别的学校继续深造。国家建立的残废军人教养院，有一部分是在风景优美的地区。教养院内学习、文娱、体育等方面设备都很齐全。四川省革命残废军人教养院有一位切去右手右足的一等残废军人杜双全，写了一首快板诗，称教养院是“荣军乐园”。他在这首诗中描写了教养院的“丛丛森林绿一片”的优美的环境，描写了教养院为残废军人安排的“有篮球场、排球场、跳舞场、奶牛场和奶羊场，这一场，那一场，不为同志们身体健康为那桩”的愉快的休养生活。
    社会主义制度也把幸福带给了在旧社会被人遗弃的或被人看作废人的盲人和聋哑人。我国有聋哑人一百三十万，盲人一百六十万，他们都已结束了悲惨的命运，受到了党和政府的关怀，获得了同健全人同样的社会地位、劳动和学习的机会。解放后我国盲人、聋哑人的福利事业有很大的发展。目前全国聋哑人生产单位有二十三所，聋哑学校七十所，聋哑中等技术学校一所，聋哑人俱乐部四所。盲人生产单位有八十五个，盲童学校十九所。现在有些地方已把有劳动力的盲人、聋哑人全部组织起来参加生产，其余大部分地区都计划在今年把有劳动力的盲人、聋哑人全部组织起来参加生产。聋哑人、盲人获得了新生活，也在歌唱社会主义。长沙市盲哑学校的一个学生写了一首诗，表达了他要歌唱社会主义、歌唱毛主席的心情。诗中说：
    一只小鸟出了笼，
    能不鸣叫吗？
    一株海棠花得了雨水，
    能不怒放吗？
    我离开了黑暗的深渊，
    能不感激救命的恩人吗？
    救命的恩人是毛主席，
    这种恩情比山高，比水深。
    在上海宣传社会主义建设总路线的队伍中有一支由三十多个盲人组成的宣传队，他们在街头表演了国乐、越剧等十多个节目，在他们的节目中，有歌颂总路线的，有歌颂盲人新生活的。他们说：“总路线照亮了盲人，我们也要歌唱，也要宣传。”
    多少年来人们的“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的理想，在我们这个时代实现了。随着社会主义所有制和社会生产力的发展，他们的生活还会一天好似一天，他们同过去的悲惨生活对比起来，怎么能不歌唱呢？
