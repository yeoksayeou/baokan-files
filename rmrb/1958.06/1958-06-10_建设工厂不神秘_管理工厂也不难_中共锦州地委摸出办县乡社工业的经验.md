　　Building Factories Isn't Mysterious, Managing Factories Isn't Difficult
　　The CCP Jinzhou Prefectural Committee Learns from Experience in Running County, Township, and Commune Industries

　　(Our Newspaper Jinzhou, June 9th) How to lead county and township industries in rapid development? Recently, the CCP Jinzhou Prefectural Committee sent working groups to various places to inspect the development of industry and summarized some experiences in solving this problem.

　　From the second half of March to the present, Jinzhou Prefecture has built more than 20,000 new small factories, mines, and workshops in its fifteen counties.

　　Before March of this year, Jinzhou Prefecture had only over 900 small factories and mines, but now it has suddenly developed to more than 20,000. How do the leaders of counties and townships grasp industry while grasping agriculture? Jinzhou region has put forward four main methods and measures.

　　In the past, leaders at all levels focused their main energy on agriculture. Now, Party organizations at all levels implement unified arrangements, inspections, and evaluations for agriculture, industry, and other work. This method was proposed by the CCP Jin County Committee in April. At that time, the Jin County Party Committee used this method to lead the high tide of industrial production, and the effect was very good. On average, more than 30 small factories and mines were built every day in the county without affecting spring plowing. When arranging and inspecting work, leaders at all levels must first inquire about agriculture and second about industry. Industrial development was also evaluated when evaluating spring plowing. The county party secretary and county party committee members went to the countryside in different areas to help with work, and they did the same. Therefore, although only one leader in each Party organization was in charge of local industry, the leadership of industry was strengthened because every leader in each Party organization inquired about industry. Due to the implementation of the "three unified" leadership method, more than 1,000 small factories and mines were built in the county in less than a month and a half, basically implementing the policy of serving agricultural production in the county. The CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Jinzhou Prefectural Committee summarized this experience and promoted it. Soon, leaders of counties and townships in Jinzhou Prefecture universally used this method to organize and promote a high tide of large-scale local industry while leading spring plowing. Now that tens of thousands of small factories and mines have been put into production one after another, leaders at all levels are still grasping industrial production tightly with this method.

　　In the past, leaders at all levels had not engaged in industry. Now they must learn to run factories. They can only learn while doing, cultivate experimental plots, and enter training classes. County party secretaries, industrial ministers, and township party committee secretaries of Jin County, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, and other counties personally took command when building factories, cultivated experimental plots in one factory, and learned to run factories. Liu Shufan, secretary of the Jin County Party Committee, and Qi Yaozhu, minister of industry, studied industrial management in the Daye Township United Factory and the Jin County State-Run Iron Smelting Plant. Recently, the Daye Township United Factory was put into production, and Qi Yaozhu learned the management experience of small factories and mines. Some counties also run temporary training classes, organizing factory directors, secretaries, and accounting personnel to use the method of summarizing work and exchanging experiences to prepare to learn and improve their knowledge of factory management in about ten days. In this way, leaders at all levels can gradually learn to lead industry.

　　After the new small factories and mines were put into production, some contradictions appeared in terms of equipment capacity and production coordination. For example, the grain and feed processing plants run by various townships could not fully meet the requirements of agricultural cooperatives, either because of insufficient mechanical equipment capacity or because of a lack of power equipment. In order to solve this contradiction, the Kazuo County Party Committee summarized and promoted the typical experience of some townships using earthen mills to process feed. The Beizhen County Party Committee and the Chaoyang County Party Committee are preparing to use the currently idle tractors and irrigation equipment as power equipment to help grain and feed processing plants solve the difficulty of insufficient power equipment. At present, the industries of many counties, townships, and communes have not yet formed a cooperative system. The oil and wine industries in Chaoyang, Beipiao, and Suizhong counties have begun to form a county-wide cooperation network. For example, after some small factories and mines built by agricultural cooperatives and commune members through fundraising were put into production, agricultural cooperatives only bought products and did not receive cash, resulting in insufficient working capital. The Jin County Party Committee decided that the factories and agricultural cooperatives should discuss together, in the spirit of mutual support, and stipulate that agricultural cooperatives should pay a part of the cash when purchasing products to help the factories overcome the difficulties.

　　In the past, Jinzhou area had few factories and mines, and the organizations and forces leading industry were very weak. In order to change this situation, 400 to 500 cadres were transferred from existing cadres to work in industrial departments. Deputy secretaries and deputy heads of townships manage industry, and one township cadre takes care of industry. Some deputy general secretaries of township branches also serve as branch secretaries of township-run factories. Each agricultural cooperative is also managed by a deputy branch secretary and deputy director. Through these measures, counties, townships, and communes throughout the area have formed strong organizations to lead and manage industry to adapt to the new situation of the great development of local industry.

### 建设工厂不神秘  管理工厂也不难  中共锦州地委摸出办县乡社工业的经验

　　建设工厂不神秘  管理工厂也不难
    中共锦州地委摸出办县乡社工业的经验
    本报锦州9日电　怎样领导在飞跃发展中的县、乡工业？最近中共锦州地委派出工作组到各地检查工业发展状况，总结出一些解决这个问题的经验。
    锦州专区从3月下半月到现在，全区十五个县新建成的小型厂矿和小作坊共达两万多个。
    锦州专区在今年3月以前还只有九百多个小型厂矿，现在突然发展到两万多个。各县、乡领导怎样在抓农业的同时又抓工业？锦州地区提出了四种主要方法和措施。
    过去各级领导把主要精力都放在农业上，现在各级党组织对于农业、工业和其他工作，都实行统一的布置、检查和评比。这个方法是4月间由中共锦县委员会提出来的。当时锦县县委为了领导好工业生产的高潮，运用了这个方法，效果很好。全县每天平均都建成三十多个小厂矿，但不影响春耕工作。各级领导干部在每次布置和检查工作的时候，第一要过问农业，第二就要过问工业。评比春耕的时候，也评比工业。县委书记和县委委员，分片下乡帮助工作，也都这样办。因此各级党组织虽然只有一个领导人员抓地方工业，但由于各级党组织的每个领导人员都要过问工业，也就加强了对于工业的领导。由于实行“三统一”的领导方法，全县不到一个半月时间，建成一千多个小型厂矿，基本上贯彻了为本县农业生产服务的方针。中共辽宁省委和锦州地委总结了这个经验，并且加以推广。不久锦州专区各县、乡领导都普遍运用这种方法，在领导春耕的同时，组织和推动了大办地方工业的高潮。现在上万个小型厂矿纷纷投入生产后，各级领导仍然以这种方法，抓紧工业生产。
    各级领导人员过去没有搞过工业，现在他们必须要学会办厂，只能边干边学，搞试验田，进训练班。锦县、凌源、朝阳等县委书记、工业部长和乡党委书记，在建厂的时候都亲自挂帅，在一个工厂搞试验田，学会办厂。锦县县委书记刘树藩和工业部长齐耀珠都在大业乡联合厂和锦县县营炼铁厂学习办工业。最近大业乡联合工厂投入生产，齐耀珠学会小型厂矿的管理经验。有些县还开办临时训练班，组织厂长、书记和财会人员，用总结工作，交流经验的方法，准备用十几天时间，来学习和提高管理工厂的知识。这样各级领导人员就可以逐步地学会领导工业了。
    新的小型厂矿转入生产以后，在设备能力、生产协作等方面都出现了一些矛盾。例如：各乡举办的粮米饲料加工厂，或者因为机械设备能力不足，或者因为缺少动力设备，都不能充分满足农业社的要求。喀左县委为了解决这个矛盾，总结并推广了有些乡用土碾子加工饲料的典型经验。北镇县委和朝阳县委准备利用目前闲置的拖拉机和灌溉设备，来作为动力设备，帮助粮米饲料加工厂解决动力设备不足的困难。现在不少县、乡、社的工业还未组成一个协作体系。朝阳、北票、绥中等县的油、酒行业，已开始组成全县的协作网。又如有些由农业社和社员集资建设起来的小厂矿投入生产以后，农业社只买产品，不收现金，因而造成流动资金不足。锦县县委便决定由工厂和农业社共同商量，本着互相支援的精神，规定农业社购买产品时，付给一部分现金，帮助工厂渡过难关。
    锦州地区过去由于厂矿较少，领导工业的机构和力量都很薄弱。为了改变这种状况，从现有干部中抽调四、五百名干部到工业部门工作。各乡副书记、副乡长管理工业，并由一个乡干部兼顾工业。有些乡总支副书记还兼任乡营工厂的支部书记。各农业社也由一位支部副书记和副主任管理工业。通过这些措施，全区各县、乡、社就组成了有力的领导和管理工业的组织，来适应地方工业大发展的新形势。
