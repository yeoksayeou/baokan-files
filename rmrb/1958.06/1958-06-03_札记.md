　　Notes
　　Living by Taking Cues from Others
　　The United States recently passed an "Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act," stipulating that in the future, "in principle," it will purchase goods domestically that were previously purchased from countries such as Japan. Only when it does not affect American domestic industry can it purchase at most 50% of the goods included in the foreign aid plan from abroad. American foreign aid has always been a means of economic aggression and political control against recipient countries. In the past, the United States shared some benefits with its sidekicks when purchasing foreign aid materials. Now it even wants to take these leftovers into its own pockets, which shows that the economic crisis has made it no longer pretend to be generous.
　　But this has made things difficult for the sidekicks. The Japanese Ambassador to the United States specially sent a report back to his country. After studying this report, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs concluded that "the situation is unexpectedly serious" because it means that the work of the United States purchasing $130 million worth of goods in Japan each year using International Cooperation Administration funds is in "danger of complete stagnation." Japan's crisis of overproduction was already becoming increasingly serious, and commodity inventories were already increasing. If these scraps previously obtained from the United States were to vanish, it would truly be "when it rains, it pours." This is precisely the sorrow of living by taking cues from others.
　　A Dagger Hidden in a Smile
　　Several million unemployed workers in the United States are struggling in hardship, and the vast working masses are also facing the threat of losing their jobs. Their anger and dissatisfaction are, of course, also increasing. At such a moment, the bulletin issued by the First National City Bank of New York released a tone saying that "economic decline also has its bright side." What is the bright side? This mouthpiece of the monopoly capitalist enterprise explained that the depression can prompt the unemployed to "seek and even learn various different occupations."
　　Of course, Citibank is not suddenly being compassionate and concerned about the interests and future of workers. In fact, there is a trick with a dagger hidden in a smile, aimed at diverting the attention of the working masses from the root of the economic crisis, easing their dissatisfaction, and thus paralyzing their will to fight.

　　札记
    仰人鼻息
    美国最近通过了一项“对外援助法修正案”，规定今后“原则上”要在美国国内采购过去从日本等国采购的物资，只是在不影响美国国内工业的情况下，才能从国外至多采购列入援外计划的50％的物资。美国的对外援助，本来就是对受援国家进行经济侵略和政治控制的一种手段。过去，美国在采购援外物资上，还分给小伙计们一些甜头，现在它连这点残羹剩肴也想收进自家腰包里去，可见经济危机已使它不再假充大方了。
    但这样一来，却苦了小伙计。日本驻美大使为此特地给国内送回了一份报告。日本外务省研究了这份报告之后，得出的结论是：“情况意外地严重”，因为这意味着美国每年使用国际合作署资金在日本采购一亿三千万美元物资的工作，有“完全停顿的危险”。日本的生产过剩危机，本来已经越来越严重，商品库存已经越来越多，如果过去从美国得到的这点餕余，再化为泡影，那可真是“屋漏又遭三更雨”了。这正是仰人鼻息的悲哀。
    笑里藏刀
    美国现有几百万失业工人在苦难中挣扎，广大劳动群众还面临着失去工作的威胁，他们的愤怒和不满当然也在增加着。在这样的时刻，纽约第一花旗银行发布的公报却放出一种论调说，“经济下降也有它光明的一面”。光明面何在呢？这份垄断资本企业的喉舌解释说，萧条可以促使失业者去“寻找以至学会各种不同的职业”。
    花旗银行当然并不是忽然大发慈悲关心起工人们的利益和前途了。实际上，这里面包含有一个笑里藏刀的诡计，目的在于转移劳动群众对经济危机根源的注意，缓和他们的不满，从而麻痹他们的斗争意志。
