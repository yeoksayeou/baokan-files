How Does Anemia Happen?
　　Xue Wen
　　"Pin" means little and insufficient, so the name anemia easily makes people think of it as a disease of having too little blood. In fact, most anemia patients do not have a low blood volume.
　　Under normal circumstances, the human body's blood volume is approximately equivalent to 7-8% of body weight. However, the human body's blood volume constantly changes with changes in posture, blood pressure, and external air pressure. For example, a person has less blood when lying down than when standing. Therefore, a blood volume slightly lower than 7-8% does not necessarily mean anemia. Conversely, some anemia patients' blood volume is not lower than this standard. What is the reason for this? It turns out that whether a person has anemia is not judged by blood volume, but by the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. So anemia is not a matter of blood quantity, but of quality.
　　Blood contains a large number of red blood cells, which is why it appears red. The red color of red blood cells is given by hemoglobin. If there are not enough red blood cells in the blood, or the hemoglobin in the red blood cells is low, or both, the color of the blood will be lighter. When the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin is low to a certain degree, it becomes anemia.
　　The number of red blood cells in the blood is extremely large. For example, in adult males, there are approximately five million red blood cells in every cubic millimeter, which is about the size of the head of a pin. Hemoglobin in red blood cells is calculated by weight, with an average of about fourteen or fifteen grams of hemoglobin per hundred milliliters. For adult males, if there are less than four million red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood, and less than twelve grams of hemoglobin per hundred milliliters of blood, it is considered anemia in medicine.
　　There are many causes of anemia, which can be roughly divided into three types:
　　One type is caused by excessive or rapid loss of red blood cells. Human red blood cells have a lifespan of approximately one hundred days from formation to aging and death. On average, about 1% of red blood cells age and die every day, but the number of newly created red blood cells is similar to the number of deaths, so the source can be replenished to maintain balance. When a person suffers rapid blood loss due to injury, or suffers from diseases such as hemorrhoids or peptic ulcers that cause continuous bleeding, the rate of red blood cell loss will exceed the rate of red blood cell production, and the person will become anemic. In addition, some people may develop anemia because their red blood cells themselves are abnormal and easily destroyed.
　　The second type is caused by insufficient supply of raw materials for blood production. Manufacturing red blood cells requires many raw materials, and iron, copper, protein, and vitamins are essential. When raw materials are insufficient, especially when iron and vitamin B are lacking, the production of red blood cells will decrease, or the quality will decrease even if the production is not low. At this time, even if the consumption of red blood cells does not increase, the person will still suffer from anemia.
　　Another reason is the decrease in hematopoietic function. The red bone marrow in bones such as the sternum, vertebrae, and skull is the workshop for manufacturing red blood cells. When these bones develop diseases for various reasons, such as poisoning by substances such as benzene and arsenic, destruction by radioactive elements, or tumors invading the bone marrow, the function of manufacturing red blood cells can be damaged.
　　The most obvious symptom of anemia from an external perspective is pale skin color. However, people with white skin are not necessarily anemic. Because skin color is also related to the dilation or contraction of capillaries, dilated capillaries make the skin appear rosy, while constricted capillaries make the skin appear whiter. Therefore, doctors cannot make a diagnosis of anemia based solely on skin color; only a blood test can make an accurate diagnosis.
　　The symptoms that anemia patients feel themselves are fatigue, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, shortness of breath after slight activity. Severely ill patients feel palpitation after activity, and even faint and lose consciousness. In addition, there are sometimes symptoms of the digestive system, as well as hepatosplenomegaly and other phenomena.

    怎么会贫血的？
    学文
    贫，是少和不足的意思，因而贫血这个病名，很容易使人联想到这是一种血少的病。其实，一般贫血病患者的血量并不少。
    在正常情况下，人体血量大约相当于体重的7—8％。但是，人体血量是常随着姿势的变更、血压的高低以及外界气压的高低而变化的，例如人躺着时候的血量就比站着时候少些。所以，血量稍低于7—8％，不一定就是贫血；相反，一些贫血病患者的血量却并不比这个标准低。这是什么道理呢？原来人是否患贫血病，并不是根据血量来判断，而是根据血里红血球或血红素的多少来判断的。所以贫血不是血的数量问题，而是质量问题。
    血液里含有大量的红血球，所以才呈现红色。红血球的红，则是血红素所赋与的。如果血里红血球不足，或红血球里的血红素低，或两者兼而有之，血液的颜色就会淡些。红血球和血红素少到一定程度时，就成了贫血病了。
    血里红血球的数量极大，以成年男子为例，每一立方毫米、也就是像大头针的针头那么大小的一滴血里，就约有五百万个红血球。红血球里的血红素是按重量计算的，每一百毫升里，平均约有血红素十四、五克。以成年男性来说，如果每一立方毫米血里红血球少于四百万，每一百毫升血里的血红素低于十二克时，医学上就认为是贫血了。
    贫血的原因很多，大致可以分为三种类型：
    一种是由于红血球损失过多或过快所造成的。人体的红血球，从造成到衰老死亡，大约有一百多天的寿命。平均每天约有1％的红血球衰老死亡，但每天新造的红血球和死亡的数目相仿，所以能源源补充保持平衡。当人受伤迅速失血，或患痔疮、消化性溃疡等病而陆续不断出血时，红血球损失的速度就会超过红血球生产的速度，人就要贫血了。另外，有的人因为红血球本身不正常，容易被破坏，也能形成贫血。
    其次一种原因是造血原料供应不足。制造红血球需要很多种原料，铁、铜、蛋白质、维生素都是不可少的。原料不足，特别是铁和维生素乙缺少时，红血球的产量就会减低，或是产量虽不低而质量降低，这时即使红血球的消耗并不增加，人也要患贫血病了。
    再一种原因是造血功能的减低。胸骨、脊椎骨、颅骨等骨头里的红色骨髓，都是制造红血球的车间。当这些骨头因种种原因发生了病变时，如中了苯、砷等物质的毒害，受了放射性原素的破坏，或肿瘤侵入了骨髓等等，都能破坏制造红血球的机能。
    人得了贫血病，从外表看来最明显的现象是皮肤的颜色苍白。不过，皮肤白的人不一定都贫血。因为皮肤颜色和毛细血管的舒张或紧缩也有关，毛细血管舒张的，皮肤就显得红润；毛细血管紧缩的，皮肤就会白一些。所以是否贫血，医生不能仅根据皮肤的颜色下断语，只有通过验血才能作出正确的诊断来。
    贫血病人自己感觉到的症状是疲倦、头痛、头晕、耳鸣，轻微活动后就感觉气喘，严重的病人在活动后觉得心慌，甚至昏倒不省人事。另外，有时还出现消化系统的症状，以及肝脾肿大等现象。
