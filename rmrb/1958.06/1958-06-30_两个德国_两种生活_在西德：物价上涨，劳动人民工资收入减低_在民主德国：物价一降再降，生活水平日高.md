Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: According to a report by the German News Agency, West Germany is experiencing rapid price increases, heavy taxes, and an increasingly difficult life for the working people, while the living standards of the working people in East Germany are steadily rising. This stark contrast fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

    Due to continuous price increases, the monthly living expenses for a family of four in West Germany today are at least 75% higher than in 1950. According to calculations by the West German "Federal Statistics Office," the average monthly living expenses for a middle-income family of four were 285 marks in 1950. However, in 1957, this family would have to pay 526 marks to buy the same quantity and quality of necessities. During this period, prices for staple and non-staple foods, coal briquettes, shoes, clothing, rent, gas, water, electricity, transportation, and postage have all generally increased. The price of coal alone has increased ten times.

    The wage income of the working people in West Germany is far from keeping up with the rapidly rising prices. Some working people are also heavily indebted due to installment purchases. Currently, most working-class families have even been forced to reduce their consumption of basic foods.

    In stark contrast to the situation in West Germany, as a result of the East German government's implementation of measures to reduce prices, increase wages, and provide other welfare benefits, the living expenses for a family of four have decreased by at least 39% from 1950 to the present.

    In the two years of 1956 and 1957 alone, the purchasing power of the working people in East Germany increased by 3.6 billion marks due to price reductions and increases in wages and pensions. The recent measure to eliminate the remnants of food rationing has further increased the purchasing power of the working people by no less than 2.8 billion marks annually.

    A comparison of current price levels in the two Germanys shows that the fixed basic living expenses for a working-class family in East Germany are 60 to 70 marks cheaper than in West Germany. In terms of butter and sugar consumption, East Germany has already far surpassed West Germany on a per capita basis. In 1957, East Germany's average per capita consumption of butter was 10.88 kilograms, while West Germany's average consumption in the same year was only 7.2 kilograms, even less than before the war.

    两个德国　两种生活
    在西德：物价上涨，劳动人民工资收入减低
    在民主德国：物价一降再降，生活水平日高
    据新华社29日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，西德物价迅速上涨、捐税繁重，劳动人民生活日益艰难，而民主德国劳动人民的生活节节上升。这种鲜明的对比充分显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。
    由于物价不断上涨，今天在西德一个四口之家的每月生活费用至少比1950年上涨了75％。据西德“联邦统计局”的计算，1950年时一个四口的中等开支的家庭每月平均生活费用是二百八十五马克。但是在1957年这家人如果要买同等数量和质量的生活必需品必须支付五百二十六马克。在这期间，主食品和副食品、煤砖、鞋、衣服、房租、煤气、水、电、车费、邮资都普遍涨了价。仅煤一项就涨价十次。
    西德劳动人民的工资收入远远跟不上迅速上涨的物价。一部分劳动人民还由于分期付款的购买而负债累累。目前大多数工人家庭甚至已经被迫减少基本食物的消费量。
    与西德的情况恰恰相反，由于民主德国政府实行降低物价、提高工资和其他福利措施的结果，从1950年到现在，一个四口之家的生活费用至少降低了39％。
    仅仅在1956和1957两年内，民主德国劳动人民的购买力就因为降低物价以及提高工资和养老金而增加了三十六亿马克。最近取消食品配给制残余的措施又使劳动人民的购买力每年增加不下二十八亿马克。
    拿两个德国目前物价水平相比较的结果表明，民主德国一个工人家庭固定的基本生活费用要比西德便宜六十到七十马克。在牛油和食糖的消费量方面，按人口平均，民主德国已经大大超过西德。1957年民主德国平均每人消费牛油十点八八公斤，而同年内西德的平均消费量只有七点二公斤，还不如战前多。
