A Tap Water Plant Built with Indigenous Methods

The employees of the Jishou Power Plant in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province built a tap water plant using indigenous methods. They used local moso bamboo for water pipes and wooden buckets instead of water towers. The pumping equipment was assembled using the power plant's water pumps.

Two years ago, the prefectural people's committee planned to invest 40,000 yuan to have the plant build a tap water plant. At that time, the technical personnel believed that there was a lack of steel and that the investment was too small, so they did not accept the task. Now it has been built for only 2,000 yuan.

    湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州吉首发电厂的职工用土办法建起一座自来水厂。他们用当地的楠竹做自来水管，用木桶代替水塔；抽水设备是利用电厂的水泵装配成的。
    两年前，州人民委员会曾准备投资四万元要求这个厂修建一座自来水厂。当时，技术人员认为缺乏钢材，投资太少，没有接受这项任务。现在只花二千元，就建立起来了。
