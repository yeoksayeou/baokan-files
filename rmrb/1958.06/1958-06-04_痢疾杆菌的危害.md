　　The Harm of Shigella Dysenteriae
　　Xiao Yu

　　People have known about dysentery for 2,400 years, but it wasn't until more than 500 years later that they discovered that dysentery is caused by Shigella dysenteriae. The first person to discover Shigella dysenteriae was the Russian, Grigoriev.

　　There is more than one type of Shigella dysenteriae; medical scientists can name at least twenty-eight. They can practically form a "Shigella dysenteriae family." In this family of scourges, the most famous is "Shiga's bacillus." A dozen or so years ago, it was rampant for a time, and hundreds of thousands of lives around the world were lost to it. But now, its ferocity is gradually dying down, and its relatives, "Flexner's bacillus" and "Sonne's bacillus," are becoming rampant.

　　Under the microscope, Shigella dysenteriae looks like a small, short stick, neither moving nor changing much. But as soon as it dies, its corpse can decompose into "endotoxin." This stuff is powerful, and it is what makes people sick.

　　According to Soviet medical scientists, Shigella dysenteriae must first pass through the first barrier of the human body - the stomach. If they are not killed by stomach acid, they can enter the intestines. The intestines absorb the "endotoxin," and if the body's resistance cannot decompose and destroy these toxins, the blood carries the toxins to all parts of the body. As a result, within forty-eight hours, the person develops a fever, stomach pain, and general discomfort. At the same time, the toxin can cause changes in the large intestine: swelling, congestion, and inflammation, which creates a suitable environment for the Shigella dysenteriae to survive. The pus and blood in the stool are products of the destruction and inflammation of the large intestine. And because the inflammation stimulates the muscles outside the anus, there is also a feeling of never being able to finish defecating.

　　Children are most susceptible to the toxins. Often, the disease starts with a high fever, coma, and convulsions, and the person dies before diarrhea even begins. The number of children who die from dysentery is four times higher than that of adults.

　　How can dysentery be transmitted from one person to another? Originally, dysentery is mainly transmitted from feces to flies, to our hands, to water, to vegetables and fruits, and then into another person's mouth, and the disease is thus spread.

　　The stool of dysentery patients contains a large number of Shigella dysenteriae. They can survive in feces for two and a half to four months (of course, this requires dark, warm conditions). However, they are afraid of sunlight; as long as they are exposed to sunlight for half an hour, they cannot survive. From this, it can be seen that paying attention to the stool of dysentery patients is very important.

　　Flies are accomplices of Shigella dysenteriae. It has been found that almost 8% to 30% of flies carry Shigella dysenteriae. It is very dangerous if we eat food that these flies have landed on.

　　Since the launch of the Four Pests Elimination campaign, there are fewer flies, and the only medium for transmitting dysentery is hands. Therefore, washing hands before meals and after using the toilet should not be ignored.

　　If the feces of patients are poured into rivers, or if toilets are too close to rivers, wells, and ponds, there will be Shigella dysenteriae in the water. It can survive in water for five days to a month. It is clear that drinking raw water is dangerous!

　　Vegetables and fruits can also be contaminated with bacteria. Dysentery bacteria can live on them for more than ten days. Therefore, it is also not advisable to eat raw and cold fruits and vegetables, unless they have been disinfected.

　　Summer and autumn have always been the rampant seasons for dysentery. Although the Four Pests Elimination and hygiene campaign has been vigorously launched this year, dysentery should be greatly reduced, but it should still not be ignored.

### 痢疾杆菌的危害

　　痢疾杆菌的危害
　　小雨
    人们在二千四百年前就知道痢疾这种病，可是知道痢疾是痢疾杆菌引起的，却要迟五百多年。第一个发现痢疾杆菌的人，是俄国人格里高尔卑夫。
    痢疾杆菌不止一种，医学家至少能举出二十八个名字来。它们简直可以组成一个“痢疾杆菌大家族”了。在这个祸害的大家族里，鼎鼎大名的是“志贺氏痢疾杆菌”。它在十几年前，曾经横行一时，世界上成千上万的生命，丧失在它的手中。可是现在，它的凶焰渐渐在熄灭，它的同族“福氏菌”和“宋氏菌”却在嚣张起来。
    从显微镜看痢疾杆菌，仿佛一节小小的短棍，既不会动，又少变化。可是它只要一死亡，它的尸体就能分解出“内毒素”来。这东西厉害，使人们闹病的，就是它。
    据苏联医学家的研究：痢疾杆菌首先得通过人体的第一道关卡——胃。要是它们没被胃酸杀死，就能进入肠内。肠子吸收了“内毒素”，如果身体抵抗力不能把这些毒素分解破坏，血液就带着这种毒素分布到身体各处。于是，在四十八小时以内，人就发烧，肚子痛，浑身不适。同时毒素能使大肠发生变化：肿胀、充血、发炎，正好给那儿的痢疾杆菌创造了生存条件。粪便里的脓血，是大肠被破坏和发炎的产物。又因为炎症刺激了肛门外边的肌肉，所以又有拉不尽的感觉。
    最受不了毒素侵害的是孩子。往往病一开始，就发高烧，昏迷，抽风，还不等泻肚，人就死去。孩子痢疾死亡的人数，要比大人多四倍。
    痢疾怎么能从一个人身上传染给另一个人身上的呢？原来痢疾主要从粪便传给苍蝇，传给我们的手，传给水，传给蔬菜和水果，于是进了另一个人的口，病就这样传了开来。
    痢疾病人的大便里，有大量的痢疾杆菌。它们在粪便里能活上二个半月到四个月（当然这是需要阴暗、暖和的条件）。可是，它怕阳光，只要阳光晒半小时，它就活不了。这样看来，注意痢疾病人的大便很重要。
    苍蝇是痢疾杆菌的帮凶。曾经有人查出，几乎8％至30％的苍蝇带有痢疾杆菌。如果我们吃了这种苍蝇停留过的食品，就很危险。
    除四害运动开展之后，苍蝇少了，传染痢疾的唯一媒介，就是双手了。所以饭前便后洗手，就不应忽视。
    把病人粪便倒入河里，或者厕所过于靠近河道、井和水塘，水里面就会有痢疾杆菌。它能在水里生存五天到一个月。可见喝生水危险！
    蔬菜瓜果，也能沾病菌。痢疾菌在上面能活十多天。所以瓜果蔬菜也不宜吃生冷的，除非经过消毒。
    夏秋两季向来是痢疾的猖狂季节，今年虽然蓬勃展开了除四害讲卫生运动，痢疾病应当大为减少，但还是不应该忽视。
