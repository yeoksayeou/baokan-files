    Tianjin Promotes the Experience of the State-Owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory
    Vigorously Run Part-Work, Part-Study Schools
    Properly Arrange Production and Life　Learning Doesn't Cost the State Money
    (Our Newspaper News) Reporters Shi Jian and Hong Minsheng report: Many factories and enterprises in Tianjin are actively learning from the experience of the State-Owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and are running part-work, part-study schools. According to incomplete statistics from seven districts, nearly thirty units have already begun to run part-work, part-study schools. These schools take various forms, including middle schools and universities; some work half a day and study half a day, others work six hours and study two hours; some are run by a single unit, others are jointly run by several units. The curriculum content is also set up according to the different circumstances of each unit and the actual needs of production.
    In order to promote the experience of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in running part-work, part-study schools, on June 3rd, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting at the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. Two hundred and sixty leading cadres from various districts and industrial bureaus listened to the introduction of the experience made by the Secretary of the Party Committee of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. After the meeting, many units held Party committee meetings to study the matter and immediately began to run the schools.
    When running part-work, part-study schools, each unit generally had the Party committee take charge personally, fully mobilized the masses, and enabled cadres and workers at all levels to recognize the political significance of running part-work, part-study schools. At the beginning, some leading cadres were afraid that running part-work, part-study schools would affect production and were unwilling to let the backbone of production participate in the study, and some old workers were also concerned that participating in the study would cause production losses. Combining the propaganda of the general line, the Party organizations of each unit repeatedly explained the significance of running part-work, part-study schools to cadres and workers. Some units also held forums with workshop cadres, old workers, and young workers to unify their thinking and understanding. Many workers recognized the important significance of cultivating intellectuals from the working class and enthusiastically signed up to participate in the study.
    Each unit also properly arranged the production order. Some units adjusted the labor organization and changed the shifts of the workers participating in the study without affecting production. Some adopted the method of making full use of working hours and tapping potential, so that the work that originally took eight hours on the construction site could be completed in six hours. Some adopted the method of mutual assistance in groups, whereby the workers participating in the study would complete the main work, and some sporadic work would be helped by others. For some operational workers, measures such as giving full play to the role of the original auxiliary workers were adopted to solve the problem.
    Regarding the issue of wage treatment for enrolled workers, after the method of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory (paying 75% of wages during study time) was announced, the workers believed that this method increased the country's economic burden and proposed that wages should not be paid during study time. When expanding the classes, the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory had already decided not to pay wages during study time. The part-work, part-study school run by the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory decided not to pay wages during study time. This decision was supported by the workers. Liu Hongru, a seventh-grade maintenance worker in the cloth field, said: "Implementing part-work, part-study is a good way to cultivate intellectuals from the working class in a faster, better, and more economical way. I very much agree with the regulation that wages should not be paid during study time. This is not a matter for one or two factories or a few workers. If all the workers participating in the study nationwide receive wages during study time, how much expenditure would the state have!" Many people expressed that they would arrange their family life well and strive to participate in the study. Some expressed that in order to complete the great task of technological revolution, they must resolutely march towards cultural advancement.
    The part-work, part-study schools of each unit all implemented the policy of education serving production and combining theory with practice in curriculum setting and teaching work. According to the actual needs of production in each unit, necessary technical courses were set up. Some schools also had engineering and technical personnel from the factory serve as technical course teachers, and were preparing to compile teaching materials based on the experience of production practice.

    天津推广国营第一棉纺织厂的经验
    大办半工半读学校
    妥善安排生产生活　学习不用国家出钱
    本报讯　记者石坚、洪敏生报道：天津市许多工厂企业，积极学习国营天津第一棉纺织厂经验，举办半工半读的工人学校。据七个区不完全统计，已有近三十个单位开始举办半工半读学校。这些学校形式多种多样，有中学、大学；有的每天工作半天、学习半天，有的工作六小时，学习两小时；有的是一个单位举办，有的是几个单位联合举办。课程内容也是根据本单位的不同情况和生产的实际需要设置的。
    为了推广国棉一厂举办半工半读学校的经验，6月3日，中共天津市委在国棉一厂举行了现场会议，各区、工业局的党政负责干部二百六十人，听取了国棉一厂党委书记所作的经验介绍。会后，许多单位召开了党委会作了研究，并立即开始举办起来。
    各单位在举办半工半读学校时，一般都由党委亲自动手，充分发动群众，使各级干部和工人认清举办半工半读学校的政治意义。在开始时，有的领导干部怕搞半工半读影响生产，不愿让生产中的骨干参加学习，有的老工人也顾虑参加学习后会使生产受到损失。各单位的党组织结合总路线的宣传，反复向干部和工人说明举办半工半读学校的意义，有的单位还召开了车间干部、老工人、青年工人的座谈会，统一了思想认识，许多工人认清了培养工人阶级知识分子的重要意义，纷纷踊跃报名参加学习。
    各单位还妥善地安排了生产秩序，有的单位在不影响生产的原则下，调整了劳动组织，调换了参加学习工人的班次。有的采取了充分利用工时、挖掘潜力的办法，使工地作业八小时的活六小时完成。有的采取小组互助办法，由参加学习的工人将主要的活干完，一些零星活由别人来帮助作，对于一些运转工人，则采取充分发挥原有辅助工的作用等办法加以解决。
    关于入学工人的工资待遇问题，国棉一厂的办法（在学习时间发工资75％）公布以后，工人们认为这个办法增加了国家的经济负担，提出学习时间不应发工资的意见。国棉一厂在扩充班次时，已决定学习时间不发工资。国棉二厂举办的半工半读学校决定学习时间不发工资，这个决定受到工人们的拥护，布场七级保全工人刘鸿儒说：“实行半工半读，是多快好省的培养工人阶级知识分子的好办法，我对学习时间不发工资的规定非常赞成。这不是一两个厂少数工人的事，如果全国参加学习的工人在学习时间内都拿工资，国家得多大的一笔支出啊！”许多人表示要安排好家庭生活争取参加学习。有的表示为了完成技术革命的伟大任务，必须坚决地向文化大进军。
    各单位的半工半读学校在课程设置和教学工作上，都贯彻执行了教育为生产服务，理论联系实际的方针，根据本单位生产上的实际需要，设置了必要的技术课程，有些学校还由本厂工程技术人员兼任技术课的教师，并准备根据生产实践的经验编写教材。（附图片）
