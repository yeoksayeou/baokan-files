Visiting a County Party Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party
    Chen Jun

    The photograph introduced to readers here is of Comrade Hanzlik, the County Party Secretary of the Brandýs County of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. At the request of the reporter, he answered some questions of concern to Chinese readers.

    Comrade Hanzlik is a lathe worker. He grew up in a revolutionary family. His father was a veteran party member from 1921, and he dedicated his life during the struggle against the German fascist occupiers in World War II. Hanzlik inherited his father's aspirations, threw himself into the anti-fascist struggle, and was admitted to the party in 1945. In 1949, he left production to receive training in agricultural policy at a party school. After that, the party assigned him to work in the countryside to carry out socialist transformation. In 1952, he became the County Party Secretary of Brandýs. Now, Brandýs is one of the four excellent counties in the Prague region.

    Our conversation began with the question of how a County Party Secretary can grasp the work of the entire county. Comrade Hanzlik stated his views straightforwardly: the ultimate standard for measuring the political work of a county is its production performance. Brandýs is a county mainly engaged in agricultural production. The county committee is leading all party members and the people of the county to strive for the goal of achieving a 30% increase in agricultural production within four years to fulfill the Five-Year Plan. This requires the county committee to go deep into reality and personally contact the masses, understand the situation, and help grassroots organizations to continue the socialist transformation of agriculture and complete agricultural collectivization on the one hand, and strengthen leadership in agricultural production on the other.

    Brandýs County has fifty-four villages, more than fifty-three thousand people, and out of more than sixteen thousand five hundred hectares of cultivated land, 80% of the land has joined cooperatives. There are a total of forty-two cooperatives in the county. In March of this year, the county's party congress proposed to expand the cooperative land by two thousand seven hundred hectares and absorb six hundred and fifty-two individual households with more than two hectares of land into the cooperatives. Judging from the numbers, this task is not very large, but because of the cooperative high tide last year, most of the remaining individual farmers are living in relatively good conditions and are unwilling to join the cooperatives. Therefore, it is even more necessary to carry out patient and meticulous work.

    Since April, the county committee has transferred cadres to form many work teams, which are sent to the grassroots to work with the party's grassroots organizations to carry out the work of expanding cooperatives. These work teams go to the villages, work with the party's grassroots organizations, specifically study the situation of each individual farmer, analyze the reasons why they are unwilling to join the cooperatives, and discuss how to persuade them. Then, they schedule dates to talk to them individually. In the past two months, forty-three households with one hundred and sixty hectares of land have been developed to join the cooperatives. However, not all individual farmers are easily persuaded. For example, in the village of Stará Boleslav, the work team encountered several farmers who were unwilling to join the cooperatives. Some said: I am already living well without joining the cooperative, why must I join! Some said, the cooperative is good, but I don't want to join now, let's talk about it later! Some people also said: The party's plan is to fully implement collectivization by 1960, let me wait two more years. Comrade Hanzlik asked here whether our country had similar situations in the process of agricultural collectivization. When the reporter informed him that there were also farmers in our country who were reluctant to give up small-scale production, he smiled and said that coercive measures should not be used against these few individual farmers. Only by striving to consolidate and develop the cooperative economy, so that it surpasses individual farmers in all aspects, can they be finally persuaded. In Brandýs County, livestock breeding and production are still weak links and have not completely surpassed some individual farmers. That is why the county committee regards expanding and improving livestock breeding as an important task in this year's agricultural production plan.

    When the reporter asked about the situation of wealthy peasants in the countryside, Comrade Hanzlik said that there were only five wealthy peasant households in the entire county. Due to the party and government's policy of restricting and squeezing out wealthy peasants, the power of wealthy peasants has been shrinking. In addition to wealthy peasants, there are also a very small number of speculators and profiteers in cities and villages. It is understood that nationwide, out of more than thirteen million four hundred thousand people, there are only one hundred and twenty thousand remaining bourgeois elements such as wealthy peasants in the countryside. The party is preparing to adopt a thorough policy of restriction and squeezing out to gradually achieve the final elimination of the wealthy peasant class.

    Brandýs County has good conditions in terms of agricultural production. The county has twelve tractor stations, one hundred and ten tractors, and the cultivation of grains has been mechanized; every village has electricity, and there is no problem with power supply; irrigation is convenient; in addition to chemical fertilizers, every village raises cattle and pigs, and there is no shortage of fertilizer sources. However, due to the large amount of land, the average cultivated land area per member of the cooperative in the county is 4.7 hectares (equivalent to more than 70 mu in our country), plus half a hectare of private plot, so the cultivation is relatively extensive, and the yield of wheat per hectare in 1957 was two thousand six hundred kilograms. The county committee has set a target of increasing production by 11% this year. This target is quite considerable compared with the agricultural growth rate in the past two years. Because nationwide, agricultural production increased by 2% in 1956 compared to 1955, and maintained the 1956 level in 1957, the situation in Brandýs County is roughly the same. The county's party congress discussed this year's production targets and determined the planned targets for each village. This year, the county's focus is on increasing livestock production, establishing feed bases, and expanding the planting area of ​​corn. At the same time, efforts are being made to increase the yield per unit area. For example, the planned yield of sugar beets per hectare is to be increased from two hundred and fifty quintals to three hundred and fifteen quintals. Now, after discussing with the masses, the various grassroots party organizations have submitted to the county committee various plans to guarantee the completion of production, stipulating the tasks of absorbing cooperative members, planting area, and over fulfilling procurement and purchase tasks. The county committee conducts inspections and supervision based on these plans. On the day the reporter visited, the county committee was holding a meeting to inspect spring plowing.

    During the conversation, the County Party Secretary took out a stack of guarantee letters, all from the party's grassroots organizations in various villages. In these guarantee letters, without exception, there is a plan to develop probationary party members. It is understood that the Czechoslovak Communist Party has more than one million four hundred and twenty thousand party members and probationary party members nationwide, accounting for more than 10% of the total population. In recent years, the party has focused on ideological education for party members and generally stopped development. Therefore, the task of developing probationary party members generally put forward by grassroots organizations aroused the reporter's interest. Comrade Hanzlik was asked to introduce the situation of the party organization.

    Brandýs County has one hundred and fifty-five grassroots party organizations, including more than ninety in factories, forty-two in rural areas, and the rest are grassroots organizations in the streets. The number of party members reached six thousand, accounting for more than 18% of the total number of adults in the county. The age composition of party members is:
    Under 26 years old accounted for 2.2%
    27-35 years old accounted for 13.9%
    36-45 years old accounted for 20.5%
    46-60 years old accounted for 41.5%
    Over 60 years old accounted for 21.9%

    From the above statistics, it is not difficult to understand the significance of the Czechoslovak Communist Party's proposal to develop young party members and improve the age composition of party members in strengthening the party's leadership and influence over young people and supplementing the party with new blood. Since the county party committee put forward this task, Brandýs County has absorbed one hundred and sixty-two probationary party members in the first quarter of this year.

    Comrade Hanzlik then took the initiative to introduce a good system for strengthening the ties between workers and peasants and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance – the system of factories guiding rural areas. There are many factories in Brandýs County, such as sugar factories, machine manufacturing factories, automobile repair factories, etc. Under the unified leadership of the county committee, each factory signs a mutual assistance contract with a rural cooperative according to needs. The following is the content of the 1957 contract signed by the Čelakovice Machine Tool Factory and the agricultural cooperative:

    The first part of the contract is the help proposed by the Čelakovice Machine Tool Factory to the agricultural cooperative:
    1. Be responsible for the inspection of all electrical equipment of the cooperative;
    2. Help solve the transportation of public building materials;
    3. Install electrical equipment and supply equipment materials for the maternity and medical clinic built by the cooperative;
    4. Send a work team to support the cooperative during the busy farming season, and the agricultural cooperative is responsible for supplying the agricultural tools for the voluntary work team;

    The other part of the contract is the guarantee put forward by the agricultural cooperative to the factory:
    1. In terms of the yield per unit area of ​​agricultural products, such as 2,500 kilograms of wheat per hectare, 30,000 kilograms of sugar beets, 4,000 kilograms of corn, etc.;
    2. In terms of livestock products, the average annual milk production per cow is 2,150 kilograms, the average pork production per hectare is 70 kilograms, and beef is 60 kilograms.

    The third part of the contract stipulates some systems and contact methods. For example, the various materials and transportation tools needed by the agricultural cooperative from the factory should be discussed with the factory in advance. The work of the factory's voluntary workers is calculated according to the work point standards of the cooperative members, and the factory is notified. The trade union pays from special expenses. The two parties invite each other to participate in various cultural and recreational activities.

    Comrade Hanzlik told the reporter that the factory's help to the agricultural cooperatives currently focuses on political guidance, helping the cooperatives improve organizational work, and working with cooperative cadres to persuade individual households to join the cooperatives. As for the specific leadership of the entire guidance work, the county people's committee is responsible, and all mutual assistance contracts must be approved by the county people's committee. The county people's committee holds a meeting of the heads of the factory trade unions in charge of guidance work every year to review and study the improvement of guidance work.

    After answering the questions raised by the reporter in detail, Comrade Hanzlik enthusiastically introduced the living standards and emotions of the farmers to the reporter. From the perspective of Brandýs County, the income of farmers is already close to the average wage of workers. Some farmers have even exceeded the level of workers. In terms of basic consumer goods, meat, butter, sugar, etc., have increased by half to one times compared to 1948. In terms of high-end consumer goods, washing machines, radios, televisions, motorcycles, electric refrigerators, etc. are also quite common in rural areas. Comrade Hanzlik said that the Communist Party has brought happiness to the people, and the vast working people wholeheartedly support the party. During the Hungarian incident, workers and farmers went to the county committee one after another to ask what the party needed them to do, expressing their willingness to accept any tasks assigned by the party. This year, half of the county's population participated in the May Day parade. These are enough to show the high political enthusiasm of the people. Comrade Hanzlik said with confidence that the road of agricultural collectivization has brought broad prospects for farmers to develop production. Farmers across the county are welcoming the party's 11th Congress with a wave of production.

    Finally, the reporter asked Comrade Hanzlik to talk about a specific example to introduce his experience in going deep into the grassroots and strengthening specific leadership. After a bit of modesty, he excitedly took the reporter to Ovčáry, a dozen kilometers away from the city. Along the way, he told the reporter that the cooperative in this village was not doing well a year ago due to the lack of experience of the cadres. The remuneration for each workday was only ten crowns, and it owed the state two hundred thousand crowns. After the specific help of the county committee and the transfer of an experienced cadre to strengthen leadership, it has completely changed its appearance after a year. Not only has the remuneration for each workday been increased to twenty crowns, but also the debt of two hundred thousand crowns has been paid off. He is willing to introduce Comrade Čulda, the chairman of the cooperative in this village, to me and ask him to talk about it in detail.

    We are almost to Ovčáry. In the fields, twenty or thirty members of the cooperative were busy transplanting cucumber seedlings. Comrade Hanzlik greeted the members cordially from afar, led the reporter over, and introduced the cucumber seedlings to the reporter. These cucumber seedlings are all cultivated in small tile pots in the nursery. When transplanting, take them out of the nursery pot by pot and plant them in the ground, where they can continue to grow immediately. Walking to a field of turnips, Comrade Hanzlik pulled up a few fresh and tender turnips and asked the reporter to taste them. The members told him that four hundred and twenty thousand of them had been harvested on this turnip field that day. Their turnips are ripe early, and a turnip is worth a crown in the market. After laughing and talking in the field for a long time, it was dusk when we found Comrade Čulda, so we could only agree to talk another day.

    We should thank Comrade Hanzlik for accompanying the reporter to personally contact the Czechoslovak countryside. In this experience, the reporter saw the close relationship between Comrade Hanzlik and the farmers, and also saw his familiarity with agricultural knowledge. Comrade Hanzlik told the reporter with vivid facts: a County Party Secretary from a worker's background has already taken root in the countryside. (Attached picture)

    访捷共一个县委书记
    陈浚
    这一张照片介绍给读者的，是捷共布朗第斯县的县委书记罕兹里克同志。他应记者的要求，回答了中国读者所关心的一些问题。
    罕兹里克同志，是一个车床工人。他成长在一个革命的家庭里。他父亲是1921年的老党员，第二次世界大战期间，在同德国法西斯占领者的斗争中，献出了自己的生命。罕兹里克继承他父亲的遗志，投入了反法西斯的斗争，1945年被吸收入党。1949年脱离了生产，在党校中接受了关于农业政策的训练，此后，党分配他到农村进行社会主义改造的工作。1952年，他就担任了布朗第斯的县委书记。现在，布朗第斯是布拉格州四个工作优秀县之中的一个。
    我们的谈话是从作为一个县委书记怎样掌握全县工作的问题开始的。罕兹里克同志开门见山地说出他的见解：衡量一个县的政治工作，最后的标准，将是这个县的生产成绩如何。布朗第斯是一个以农业生产为主的县。县委会正在领导着全县的党员和人民，为四年里实现五年计划，农业增产30％的目标而努力着。这样，就要求县委深入实际和群众亲身接触，了解情况，帮助基层组织，一方面继续进行农业社会主义改造，完成农业合作化；另一方面加强对农业生产的领导。
    布朗第斯县共有五十四个村子，五万三千多人，在一万六千五百多公顷耕地中，已有80％的土地加入了合作社，全县共有四十二个合作社。今年3月间，县的党代表大会上提出了要扩大合作社土地二千七百公顷，吸收六百五十二户有地两公顷以上的单干户入社。如果从数字上来看，这个任务并不算很大，可是，由于经过去年合作社的高潮，剩下的个体农户，大部分是生活条件比较优越，不愿意入社的。因之，就更需要进行耐心和细致的工作。
    四月份以来，县委会抽调干部，组成了许多工作组，派到基层去，协同党的基层组织，进行扩大合作社的工作。这些工作组到了村里，同党的基层组织一起进行工作，具体研究每一户个体农民的情况，分析他们不愿入社的原因，讨论怎样对他们进行说服工作。然后排定日期，找他们个别谈话。两个月来，全县已发展了四十三户、一百六十公顷土地入社。但是，并不是所有的单干农民都是很容易说服的。比如在斯达约维采村，工作组就碰到几个不愿入社的农民。有的说：我没有入社，生活已经过得很好了，为什么一定要入社呢！有的说，合作社好是好，可是现在我还不想入，往后再说吧！也有的人说：党的计划，要到1960年才全盘实行合作化，让我再等两年吧。罕兹里克同志讲到这里，问到我国在农业合作化过程中，有没有这种类似的情况。当记者告以这样留恋小生产方式的农民，在我国也是有的时候，他笑了起来，并且说，对这些少数的个体农民，是不能用强制手段的，只有努力巩固和发展合作社的经济，使它在各个方面都超过个体农民的时候，才能最后说服他们。而在布朗第斯县，目前在牲畜繁殖和产量方面，还是一个薄弱的环节，没有完全超过某些个体农民。这就是为什么县委会在今年的农业生产计划中，以扩大和改良牲畜饲养，作为一项重要任务。
    当记者问到农村中的富农情况的时候，罕兹里克同志说，全县只有五户富农了。由于党和政府实行了限制和排挤富农的政策，富农的势力日益缩小。除了富农之外，城市和乡村中还有极少数进行投机倒把的分子。据了解，就全国来说，一千三百四十多万人口中，农村中富农等残余资产阶级分子也只有十二万人了。党正准备采取彻底的限制和排挤政策，逐步达到最后消灭富农阶级。
    在农业生产方面，布朗第斯县是有良好条件的。全县有十二个拖拉机中心站，一百一十台拖拉机，谷物的耕作已机械化；村村有电，动力没有问题，灌溉方便；除了化学肥料，村村养牛养猪，肥源不缺。不过，由于地多，全县平均每个社员的耕地面积是四点七公顷（合我国七十亩多），还有半公顷自留地，因之，耕作比较粗放，麦子每公顷的产量，1957年是二千六百公斤。县委会今年提出增产11％的指标。这个指标，如果同过去两年农业增长的速度来比是相当可观的。因为就全国范围讲，农业生产1956年比1955年增长了2％，1957年保持了1956年的水平，布朗第斯县的情况，也大致如此。县的党代会上，讨论了今年的生产指标，并且确定了每个村的计划指标。今年全县的重点是增加牲畜产量，建立饲料基地，扩大玉蜀黍种植面积，同时，努力提高单位面积产量，如甜菜的产量每公顷计划从二百五十公担提高到三百一十五公担。现在，各个基层党组织，经过同群众的讨论，已向县委提出保证完成生产的各种计划，规定了吸收合作社社员，种植面积、超额完成征购和收购的任务。县委根据这些计划，进行检查督促。记者去访问的那一天，县委正在召开检查春耕的会议。
    在谈话过程中，县委书记拿出了一叠保证书，都是来自各村的党的基层组织的。在这些保证书中，无例外的都有一项发展候补党员的计划。据了解，捷共在全国有党员和候补党员一百四十二万多，占人口总数的10％以上。近几年来，党着重对党员进行思想教育工作，一般停止了发展。因之，基层组织中普遍提出的发展候补党员任务，引起了记者的兴趣，请罕兹里克同志介绍了一下党组织的情况。
    布朗第斯县，有一百五十五个党的基层组织，其中九十多个工厂的，四十二个农村的，其余是街道的基层组织。党员人数达六千人，占全县成年人总数的18％强。党员的年龄组成是：
    二十六岁以下的占2.2％
    二十七岁—三十五岁的占13.9％
    三十六岁—四十五岁的占20.5％
    四十六岁—六十岁的占41.5％
    六十岁以上的占21.9％
    从上面这个统计数字里，就不难明白捷共提出发展年青党员，改善党员年龄组成，对于党加强对青年的领导和影响、为党补充新的血液的意义了。布朗第斯全县从党提出了这一任务以来，今年第一季度里，已吸收了一百六十二个候补党员。
    罕兹里克同志接着主动地介绍了他们密切工农联系，加强工农联盟的一种优良的制度——工厂辅导农村的制度。布朗第斯县有很多工厂，如制糖厂、机器制造厂、汽车修理厂等等。在县委的统一领导下，各个工厂都按照需要，同一个农村合作社订立互助合同。下面就是切拉科维茨机床厂和农业合作社签订的1957年的合同的内容：
    合同的第一部分，是切拉科维茨机床厂提出的对农业合作社的帮助：
    1、负责合作社全部电气设备的检查；
    2、帮助解决公共建筑材料的运输工作；
    3、为合作社建设的产科医务所装置电气设备和供应装备材料；
    4、农忙期间派工作队支援合作社，义务工作队的农具由农业合作社负责供给；
    合同的另一部分是农业合作社向工厂提出的保证：
    1、在农产品单位面积产量方面，如每公顷小麦二千五百公斤，甜菜三万公斤，玉米四千公斤等；
    2、在畜产方面，牛奶每头牛平均年产量二千一百五十公斤，每公顷平均产猪肉七十公斤，牛肉六十公斤。
    合同的第三部分，规定一些制度和联系办法，比如农业合作社所需要工厂的各种材料、交通工具的帮助，要事先同工厂商定，工厂义务工作队员的工作，按社员工分标准计算，通知工厂，由工会从特别费用中支付。双方互相邀请参加举办的各种文化娱乐活动。
    罕兹里克同志告诉记者，目前工厂对农业社的帮助，着重在政治上的辅导，帮助合作社改进组织工作，同社干部一起，说服单干户入社。至于整个辅导工作的具体领导，由县人民委员会负责，所有互助合同，都要经县人民委员会批准。县人民委员会每年要召开各厂工会主持辅导工作的负责人的会议，检查和研究改进辅导工作。
    在详细地解答了记者提出的问题以后，罕兹里克同志热情地向记者介绍了农民的生活水平和情绪。从布朗第斯县来说，农民所得，已经接近于工人的平均工资。有的农民还超过了工人的水平。在基本消费品方面，肉类、牛油、糖等等，比起1948年来，都增加了半倍到一倍，就在高级消费品方面，洗衣机、收音机、电视机、摩托车、电气冰箱等在农村中也已相当普遍。罕兹里克同志说，共产党给人民带来了幸福，广大劳动人民是衷心拥护党的。在匈牙利事变的时候，工人农民纷纷到县委会来，问党需要他们做什么事情，表示愿意接受党所分配的任何任务。今年“五一”节，参加游行的人数达到全县人口的一半。这些，都足以表明人民政治热情的高涨。罕兹里克同志充满信心地说，农业合作化的道路，已经给农民发展生产带来了广阔的远景。全县农民正以生产热潮来迎接党的第十一次代表大会。
    最后，记者要求罕兹里克同志再谈一个具体的实例，介绍他深入基层，加强具体领导的经验。他谦逊了一番，就兴冲冲地把记者带到距城十几公里的奥夫恰里去。一路上他告诉记者，这个村里的合作社，一年以前，由于干部缺乏经验，办得很不好，每个劳动日的报酬只有十克朗，并且欠了国家二十万克朗的债务。经过县委的具体帮助，并且抽调了一个有经验的干部去加强领导，一年以后，已经完全变了样。不但每个劳动日的报酬提高到二十克朗，并且还清了二十万克朗的债务。他愿意把这个村的合作社主席丘尔达同志介绍给我，请他详细谈谈。
    快到奥夫恰里了。田里二三十个社员，正在忙着移栽黄瓜秧。罕兹里克同志老远地就同社员们亲热地打起招呼来，把记者引过去，向记者介绍移栽黄瓜秧。这些黄瓜秧都是在苗圃里用小瓦钵培养出来的。移栽的时候，一钵一钵地从苗圃里取出来，栽到地里，马上就可以继续生长。走到一块蔓菁地边，罕兹里克同志拔起几个新嫩的蔓菁，请记者尝新。社员们告诉他，在这一片蔓菁地上，当天已经收了四十二万个，他们的蔓菁成熟得早，到市上，一个蔓菁值一个克朗。在地里又说又笑地耽搁久了，当我们找到丘尔达同志的时候，已经是薄暮时分，只能约定改日再谈了。
    应当感谢罕兹里克同志陪同记者亲身接触了一次捷克斯洛伐克的农村。在这一次经历中，记者看到了罕兹里克同志同农民的亲切关系，也看到了他对农业知识的熟悉，罕兹里克同志用生动的事实告诉了记者：一个工人出身的县委书记，已经在农村中落户生根了。（附图片）
