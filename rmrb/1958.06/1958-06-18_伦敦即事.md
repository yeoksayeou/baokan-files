Incidents in London
Poems by Zhu Liru
Illustrations by Jiang Yousheng
A friend came from England and spoke of the recent strikes in London. Moved after hearing this, I composed a poem to record it.

    High prices in London
    Workers in an uproar
    The government waits and watches
    The more it waits, the worse it gets
    Buses no longer run on the streets
    Hundreds of large ships all drop anchor
    The subway is silent
    Stations are closed, no tickets sold
    Employees are late for work
    Babies need to be carried to school
    Morning newspapers read at night
    The order of life is completely turned upside down
    Pedestrians wait on the sidewalks
    "Hello, hello" fills the streets
    Stop passing cars
    "Take me with you, please?"
    Bananas rot in the holds
    Potatoes and radishes are hard to store
    Fruits and vegetables are scarce
    Vitamin C is unattainable
    "The British Empire" is in a mess
    "The Free World" is unreliable
    The East wind blows high
    Overpowering the West wind (with picture)

### 伦敦即事

    伦敦即事
    朱力如诗
    江有生图
    有朋自英国来，谈起最近伦敦罢工事。听后有感，咏诗纪之。
    伦敦物价高
    工人闹风潮
    政府等着瞧
    愈等愈不妙
    公共汽车不上街
    上百大船全抛锚
    地下铁道静悄悄
    车站关门不卖票
    职员上班都迟到
    娃娃上学要人抱
    早晨的报纸晚上瞧
    生活秩序全颠倒
    行人等在人行道
    “哈罗哈罗”满街叫
    拦住过路小汽车
    “把我带走好不好”
    香蕉烂在船仓里
    土豆萝卜难进窖
    水果蔬菜都缺少
    维他命C吃不到
    “大英帝国”乱糟糟
    “自由世界”不牢靠
    东风刮的高
    压得西风倒（附图片）
