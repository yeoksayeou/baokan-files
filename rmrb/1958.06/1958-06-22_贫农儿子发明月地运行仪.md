Column: Greatness Comes From the Ordinary

    The inventor of the Earth-Moon Orbit Instrument, Zhang Junde, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, is the son of a poor peasant from Zhangjiabao, Hu County, Shaanxi Province. As a child, he relied on his mother's weaving to earn a little money to barely continue his schooling until graduating from junior high school. At the age of twenty-one, he began working as an elementary school teacher, teaching natural science. When he lectured on why there are day and night, as well as solar and lunar eclipses, he felt very difficult because there was no instrument to explain these problems. So he used his brain to find a solution. Finally, in 1951, he created an instrument that could explain more than a dozen astronomical phenomena, which is the "Earth-Moon Orbit Instrument" that is now available in various schools.

    In the process of Zhang Junde's trial production of the "Earth-Moon Orbit Instrument," he suffered all kinds of accusations and ridicule. Some people said, "Young boy, what do you know!" Some people said, "A country bumpkin still wants to invent an instrument!" But he ignored these comments and persisted in experimenting. After more than five years of efforts, especially after liberation, with the encouragement and help of the Party organization and the school administration, he finally succeeded in the trial production.

    贫农儿子发明月地运行仪
    月地运行仪的发明人、中国共产党党员张俊德，是陕西省鄠县张家堡一个贫农的儿子。小时靠母亲织布赚点钱，勉强念书到初中毕业。二十一岁开始当小学教员，教自然课。当他讲到为什么会有白天和黑夜以及日食、月食等问题时，因为没有一个可以说明这些问题的仪器，很感困难。于是就开动脑筋，想办法。终于在1951年制出了能说明十几种天文现象的仪器，这就是现在各个学校里都有的“月地运行仪”。
    在张俊德试制“月地运行仪”的过程中，曾遭受到种种责难和嘲笑，有人说：“年青娃娃懂个啥！”有人说：“土包子还想发明什么仪器！”但是他没理会这些，坚持不懈地试验，经过五年多的努力，尤其在解放后，受到党组织和学校行政上的鼓励和帮助，最后试制成功。
