　　Cultural Sower in a Mountain Village
　　By our reporter Gao Changren
    Every evening when the lamps are lit, forty-two members of the first, second, and third production teams of the Dashan Agricultural Cooperative in Yanghua Township, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, holding flashlights and torches, converge from all directions on a mountain village called Wenjiachong. They are going to study at the people's school. At the same time, a fifty-seven-year-old man, carrying a four-sided lantern with a broken glass cover patched with white paper, walks from a mountain village called Miaochong towards Wenjiachong. This man is Zhang Anqu, a model mass teacher at this people's school.
    Zhang Anqu has been serving as a mass teacher in the Dashan Cooperative since 1953. He comes from a poor peasant family, and with the help of some peasants in his clan, he finished higher primary school. Later, through diligent self-study, he taught primary school in that mountain village. When the township launched the literacy campaign in 1953, he was very much in favor of it, because he deeply knew the pain of the poor who could not afford to study in the past. Now that the government wants to enable people who had no opportunity to study in the past to become literate, this is such a good thing. When the township cadres asked him to receive training in the county, he said with emotion, "Now that I can do something for the great cultural liberation of the peasants, then I can rest assured."
    Zhang Anqu has to walk four miles of mountain road to and from school, but he has never been late. Sometimes, his wife prepares dinner too late, and he would rather go to class hungry than make dozens of students wait for him alone. He never misses class in wind, rain, or snow. One very cold and rainy day, in the classroom, he saw a girl named Hu Zhiwen coming to class barefoot, so he asked her with concern, "Aren't you cold coming to class barefoot?" Hu Zhiwen replied crisply, "Teacher Qu is so old and not afraid of the cold, running seven or eight miles to teach us, how can we young people be afraid of the cold." At this time, all the students in the classroom said in unison, "Teacher Qu is not afraid of the cold, and we are not afraid of the cold."
    This incident moved Zhang Anqu, and also moved and urged all the students. From then on, every night when it was time for class, the number of people who arrived was very complete.
    Another time, it was a snowy night, and the mountain roads were covered with ice. Zhang Anqu was returning home after class, and after all, he was old. He accidentally fell on the road and broke the lantern he was using for lighting. The next night, he still went to class as usual, but the lantern was different. There was a half-section of white paper on the broken glass cover.
    When he started teaching, he used the same method he used to teach children in the past to teach these adults: explaining each sentence in the textbook, spending more time explaining, and less time for students to practice. As a result, the students were not very interested, and some people slowly stopped coming frequently. Zhang Anqu discovered this situation and thought about it for several days before realizing that he could not use this method to teach adults. He later tried to be more concise in his lectures, giving the students more time to practice, and at the same time, strengthening individual tutoring. Sure enough, the students felt that they gained a lot, made rapid progress, and their interest in learning was also high.
    Zhang Anqu is not only a model mass teacher, but also a good cooperative member. While teaching, he can combine it with the cooperative's central tasks and do some publicity and education work for the students. Now the cooperative has established three more people's schools, and Zhang Anqu leads and helps these people's school teachers. The Party branch secretary often cares about and asks Zhang Anqu if he has any difficulties in teaching and personal life, but every time Zhang Anqu does not make any personal requests. He always says excitedly, "I have not done many things for the cooperative, and the cooperative's care for me is already very good (he is a semi-five guarantee household in the cooperative, and he is given fifty yuan each year). My wife and I are already eating well and dressing warmly, what else can we ask for."
    The Party and the people will give honor and rewards to those who can diligently contribute their strength to socialism. Zhang Anqu has been repeatedly rated as a model teacher.

　　山村中的文化播种人
　　本报记者　高长任
    每到点灯的时候，湖南省浏阳县杨花乡大山农业社第一、二、三生产队分散的村落中，就有四十二名社员打着手电，点着火把，从四面八方向名叫文家冲的那个山村汇集。他们是到民校读书的。也就在这个时候，有一位五十七岁的老人，提着一盏用白纸糊着破玻璃罩的四马灯，从名叫庙冲的山村走向文家冲。这人就是这个民校的模范群众教师张安渠。
    张安渠担任大山社的群众教师，是从1953年开始的。他的家庭成分是贫农，小时候他在家族里一些农民的帮助下，读完了高小。以后，经过自己勤学苦练，就在那个山村里教小学。1953年乡里开展扫除文盲工作的时候，他是万分的赞成，因为他深知过去穷人读不起书的痛苦，现在政府要让过去没机会读书的人能够识字，这是多么好的事情啊。当乡里干部请他到县里受训的时候，他感动地说：“现在能够为农民文化大翻身做点事情，那我就可以安心了。”
    张安渠从家到学校来回要走八里山路，但从来没有迟到过。有时，他的妻子把晚饭做得太迟了，他就宁愿饿着肚子去上课，也不叫几十名学员等着他一个人。风雨雪天，也从不间断。一个很冷的阴雨天，在课堂上，他看到一个叫胡芷文的女孩子是赤着脚来上课，就关心地问她：“你打赤脚来上课，不冷吗？”胡芷文回答的很俐落：“渠老师这么大的年纪还不怕冷，跑七、八里路来替我们上课，我们青年人还能怕冷。”这时，全教室的学员都一连声地说：“渠老师不怕冷，我们也不怕冷。”
    这件事感动了张安渠，也感动和督促了全体学员，以后，每晚一到上课的时间，人数都到的非常整齐。
    又一次，是个雪后的夜晚，山路上都结了冰，张安渠散学回家，到底年纪大了，一不小心在半路上摔了一跤，把那盏照明的马灯也跌坏了。第二天晚上，他还是照常上课，只是那盏马灯不同了，破玻璃罩上多了半截白纸。
    他开始教学时，还用过去教小孩子的办法来教这些成年人：照课本逐句讲解，讲的时间多，学员练习的时间就少了。这样，学员们兴趣不大，有的人就慢慢来得不勤了。张安渠发现这个情况，想了好几天，才领悟到不能用这个办法来教成年人，他以后在讲课时尽量讲得扼要一些，多给些时间让学员练习，同时，加强个别辅导。果然，学员们感到收获大，进步快，学习兴趣也高了。
    张安渠不仅是模范群众教师，还是一个好社员。在教学时，他能结合社里中心任务，对学员们做些宣传教育工作。现在社里又办了三所民校，张安渠领导和帮助这些民校教师。党支部书记常常关怀询问张安渠教学上和个人生活上有什么困难，但每一次张安渠都没有提出什么个人要求。他总是兴奋地说：“我没有替社里做好多事，社里对我的照顾已经很好了（他是社里的半五保户，每年分给他五十元）。我老两口已经吃的饱、穿的暖，还能有什么要求。”
    对于能够勤勤恳恳为社会主义贡献自己力量的人，党和人民是会给予他荣誉和奖励的。张安渠连续被评为模范教师。
