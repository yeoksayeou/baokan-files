    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 13th: The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) Executive Bureau meeting has concluded after two days of discussion. The meeting passed a resolution calling on workers to oppose the plot that rioters may carry out on June 18th, a statement on current events and the fight against fascism, and a resolution on the demands of the working class.
    In its resolution regarding June 18th, the CGT Executive Bureau pointed out: De Gaulle and those who support him are preparing to turn June 18th in Paris and major French cities into a day of expressing support for personal autocracy, military dictatorship, and fascism. The rioters organized in the so-called "Committees of Public Safety," the Petainists who betrayed their country, and those who carried out the riots in Algiers and Ajaccio are preparing to use this anniversary of the resistance movement to organize fascist demonstrations against the Republic. The Executive Bureau calls on all CGT organizations, all activists, union members, and workers to contact the Committees for the Defense of the Republic and take all effective measures to thwart any riot attempts to attack various trade union organizations and democratic organizations on this day, and to turn this day into a great day for defending freedom.
    The CGT Executive Bureau's statement on current events and the fight against fascism pointed out that the unity forged between workers and members of all [democratic] organizations in strikes and demonstrations should be further strengthened to become an irresistible force. The French CGT calls on all workers to continue and strengthen the struggle to safeguard all freedoms and the Republic, and not to allow any infringement of their rights. The French CGT calls for a strong response to any riot attempts immediately, and calls for crushing any attempts to establish "Committees of Public Safety" or other riot organizations within enterprises. The CGT calls on everyone to consolidate and vigorously develop numerous and active Committees for the Defense of the Republic in enterprises. The CGT calls on all workers to prepare from now on to participate in the great battle of the referendum, in order to oppose personal autocracy and dictatorial systems.
    The resolution calls on all organizations to strengthen united action to defend economic and social demands, and to strive for universal increases in wages and benefits, as well as other welfare benefits. The resolution calls for strengthening the unified struggle in order to achieve peace in Algeria.
