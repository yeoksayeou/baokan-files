Six students from the Agricultural Machinery Department of Northeast Agricultural College, including Tang Yuqing, during their internship at the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Xingfu Township, Shuangcheng, inspired by the nationwide farmers' tool reform and the urgent needs of the farmers, with the strong support of the Township Party Committee and the Cooperative Party Branch, and in cooperation with carpentry workers, after seven days and nights of hard work, successfully trial-produced a comprehensive No. 3 three-wheeled double-ridge corn planter.

The successful trial production of this corn planter completely solved the problem of excessive labor, insufficient manpower, inability to cope, and failure to complete the plan. After the corn planter was successfully trial-produced, it was field-tested and its effect was very good, and it was well received by the masses. The masses believe that this corn planter has high efficiency and good planting quality. It can not only perform continuous operations such as corn planting, applying fertilizer, interplanting soybeans, and cultivating soil and compacting, but also has equal spacing and uniform seeding and fertilizer application, is easy to operate, and is suitable for animal traction. With slight modifications, it is also suitable for mechanical traction.

After the corn planter was field-tested and evaluated, the county agricultural tool workshop plans to start producing a portion according to current needs and supply them to agricultural cooperatives in various places. These six students are working with iron and wood workers from the Xingfu Cooperative to jointly research and trial-produce weeding machines and topdressing machines.

    东北农学院汤玉清等六名学生
    创造三轮双垅苞米垵种机
    东北农学院农业机械系汤玉清等六名同学，在双城幸福乡幸福农业社实习期间，由于全国各地农民改革工具的鼓舞和农民的迫切要求的启发，在乡党委和社党支部的大力支持下，和木匠工人共同协作，经过七昼夜的刻苦钻研，试制成功一台综合号三轮双垅苞米垵种机。
    这台苞米垵种机试制成功就完全解决了用工多，劳力少，干不过来，完不成计划的问题。苞米垵种机试制成功后经过实地试验鉴定效果很好，颇受群众欢迎。群众认为这种苞米垵种机效率高，播种质量好。它不仅能使苞米垵种施把肥、混种小豆和培土、镇压连续作业同时进行，并且等距和下种量与播粪量均匀，操作简便，适于畜力牵引，如再稍加改装后，还适于机械牵引。
    这台苞米垵种机，经过实地试验鉴定后，县农具坊根据当前需要，计划开始生产一部分，供应各地农业社。这六位同学正在和幸福社的铁木工人共同研究试制除草机和追肥机等。
