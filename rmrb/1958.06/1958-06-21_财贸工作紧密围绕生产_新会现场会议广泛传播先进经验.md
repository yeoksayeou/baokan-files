Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hailan reports: Over the past few days, more than two hundred and ninety financial and trade cadres from all over the country, at the National Financial and Trade Work On-site Conference held in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, have been enthusiastically discussing how financial and trade work can support and promote production, the technological revolution in commercial departments, improvements in enterprise management, and Party leadership.

According to reports from representatives from various regions, under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, in addition to doing a good job in commodity circulation and capital accumulation, financial and trade work has also promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production by intervening in production and organizing and mobilizing the masses to produce. In areas where the work has been done better, financial and trade work has been intertwined with production, and the greatest efforts have been made to help agricultural cooperatives develop diversified operations and promote the sales of agricultural and sideline products and handicrafts. For example, the commercial department in Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, has helped agricultural cooperatives develop more than 1,600 forest gardens. The commercial department in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, helped agricultural cooperatives develop more than 200 new products by adopting six methods: capture, raise, dig, plant, collect, and manufacture. In terms of the supply of means of production and fertilizers, various regions have shown their unique abilities, and the number of newly discovered varieties and supplies cannot be counted.

Representatives from various regions also reflected that running industries by commercial departments has greatly promoted the development of local industries. The financial and trade departments in Lushan County, Henan Province, plan to expand and build 130 factories and mines this year. By mid-May, 35 factories and mines had started production, producing more than 20 kinds of products such as cement, lime, paper, flour, and food. From the current point of view, most of the industries run by commercial departments are related to their own business, serving agricultural production and local industries with some processing industries and other small industries. Such as the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products, non-staple food, local products, export commodities of waste products; small-scale industries demonstrating to townships and communes; small-scale farm tools, machinery repair shops, etc. These are some industries that the industrial departments do not run, and the investment is not large, and the technicality is not high.

In addition to the commercial departments, other financial and economic departments have also done a lot of work in supporting and promoting production. The grain department has made it convenient for the masses and saved farmers' labor in the collection, purchase, and sale of grain, and has helped agricultural cooperatives to run processing factories well; do a good job in the supply of seeds, feed, and cake fertilizer. The financial department starts from the development of production, opens up financial resources, and increases financial revenue. The banking department mainly raises and supplies funds in every possible way through savings, deposits, and loans. These practices have achieved remarkable results.

When discussing the issue of improving business management, representatives from various regions, based on their own experiences and understandings, believed that workers' participation in management, cadres' participation in labor, and mass participation in supervision are important systems for running enterprises well and are also the direction for improving business management. Hubei Province is promoting the system of enterprise workers' congress, holding regular meetings under the leadership of the Party committee, and the effect is very good. The representatives unanimously believed that this system can be universally promoted. In addition, some reforms should also be carried out in the work system so that workers can regularly participate in enterprise management. Chongqing City has decentralized the plans of business, property management, labor organization and capital use to groups in the reform of rules and regulations, which can make workers feel truly in charge, give play to their enthusiasm, and run the enterprise well. Some areas have adopted the method of holding resident representative meetings to listen to the opinions of the masses or have store employees go deep into the residents to solicit opinions and understand needs. Some areas also invite resident representatives to participate in certain meetings of the store. These experiences of enabling the masses to participate in enterprise supervision are all worth promoting.

Everyone also pointed out that financial and trade work must be carried out around the central work of the Party, because the central work is the mainstream of the current socialist revolution and socialist construction, which is the greatest politics. Leaving the central work and completing the tasks of financial and trade work in isolation is actually detaching from politics, and the business work will inevitably be done poorly. After listening to the experience introduction of Xinhui and other places, everyone believed that the county party committees of these counties clearly took industrial and agricultural production as the center, so that financial and trade work and other tasks served production, served the central work, and led other tasks with the central work, and supported and promoted each other, so that all fronts could leap forward together. This experience of twisting the central work and financial and trade work into a rope is mature, comprehensive, and completely feasible. Everyone said that they would vigorously promote and popularize it in future work, so that it will fully blossom and bear fruit in every county.

In addition, the conference also discussed the issues of financial and trade cadres being both red and expert, the work of Party grassroots organizations, and how to carry out rectification to the end.

    财贸工作紧密围绕生产
    新会现场会议广泛传播先进经验
    据新华社广州20日电　新华社记者章海蓝报道：来自全国各地的二百九十多个财贸干部，这几天，在广东省新会县举行的全国财政贸易工作现场会议上，热烈地讨论了财贸工作如何支持和促进生产、商业部门的技术革命，企业改善经营管理和党的领导等问题。
    根据各地代表汇报，财贸工作在工农业生产大跃进的新形势下，除了做好商品流通和资金积累以外，还从插手生产、组织和发动群众生产方面，促进了工农业生产的发展。工作做得较好的地区，财贸工作已与生产扭在一起，在帮助农业社开展多种经营、推销农副产品和手工业品等方面，都尽了最大的努力。例如四川省奉节县商业部门就帮助农业社发展了一千六百多个林园。广东省新会县商业部门帮助农业社采用捉、养、挖、种、采、制六个办法，发展了二百多种新的产品。在生产资料和肥料供应上，各地更是各显神通，新发掘的品种和供应数量无法统计。
    各地代表还反映商业部门办工业，对促进地方工业的发展有很大的作用。河南省鲁山县财贸部门今年规划扩建厂矿一百三十个，到5月中旬已有三十五个厂矿开工生产，出产水泥、石灰、纸、面粉、食品等二十多种产品。从目前来看，商业部门举办的工业，大多数是与本身业务有关的，为农业生产和地方工业服务的一些加工工业和其他小型工业。如农副产品、副食品、土特产、废品出口商品的加工工业；给乡社示范的小型工业；小型的农具、机械修配厂等等，这些都是工业部门不办的，而且投资不大，技术性又不高的一些工业。
    除商业部门外，其他财经部门在支持和促进生产上也做了很多工作。粮食部门在征、购、销中做到了便利群众，节省农民的劳动力，并帮助农业社办好加工厂；做好种子、饲料、饼肥的供应。财政部门从发展生产入手，开辟财源，增加财政收入。银行部门主要是通过储蓄、存款、贷款等活动，千方百计筹集资金和供应资金。这些做法都已收到显著效果。
    在讨论到改善经营管理问题时，各地代表根据自己的经验和体会，认为职工参加管理，干部参加劳动，群众参加监督，是办好企业的重要制度，也是改善经营管理的方向。湖北省正在推行企业职工代表大会制度，在党委领导下，定期举行会议，效果很好。代表们一致认为这个制度可以普遍推行。此外，还应该在工作制度上进行一些改革，使职工能经常参加到企业管理中来，重庆市在革新规章制度中，把计划经营、财产管理、劳动组织、资金使用下放给小组，这样做可以使职工感到真正当家作主，发挥他们的积极性，把企业办好。有的地区采取召开居民代表会议办法，经常听取群众的反映，或由商店职工深入到居民中，征求意见，了解需要情况。有些地区还采取邀请居民代表参加商店的某些会议。这些使群众参加企业监督的经验，都是值得推广的。
    大家还指出财贸工作必须围绕党的中心工作来进行业务工作，因为中心工作就是当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主流，就是最大的政治，离开了中心工作，孤立地去完成财贸工作任务，实际上就是脱离政治，这样业务工作必然是搞不好的。大家听了新会等地的经验介绍，认为这些县的县委明确地以工农业生产为中心，使财贸工作和其他各项工作服务于生产，服务于中心工作，以中心工作带动其他各项工作，并互相支持，互相促进，使各条战线都能一齐跃进。这种把中心工作、财贸工作扭成一股绳的经验，是成熟的，全面的，而且是完全可以行得通的。大家表示一定在今后工作中大力提倡、推广，使它在每个县全面开花结果。
    此外，大会还讨论了财贸干部红与专、党的基层组织工作、怎样把整风坚持到底等问题。
