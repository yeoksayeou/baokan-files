Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: The full text of the speech given by Korean Premier Kim Il Sung tonight at the banquet to welcome the second group of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea:

Dear Comrade Xiao Yingtang, General of the Chinese People's Volunteers!
Dear Comrades Xie Zhenhua and Wang Yi, Generals of the Chinese People's Volunteers!
Dear Comrades, Officers and Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers!

On behalf of the Korean Workers' Party, The Republic's government, and all the Korean people, I extend my deepest gratitude and highest honor to the comrades, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have performed great feats in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Korean people and the consolidation of peace in the East, and who are about to return to their country.

It has been seven and a half years since you crossed the Yalu River, holding high the sacred banner of resisting America and aiding Korea. Over these years, you have shared weal and woe with the Korean people, demonstrating unparalleled heroism and bravery, and establishing immortal and great achievements.

Taught and nurtured by the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, you have fully demonstrated to the people of the world that you are a true people's army, a true Marxist-Leninist party's army, and a true internationalist army. The feats you have established will forever shine with our beautiful rivers and mountains. The deep friendship you have forged with the Korean people will forever remain in the hearts of the Korean people and their descendants.

The People's Republic of China has consistently provided tremendous assistance, both materially and spiritually, for the freedom and happiness of the Korean people. At the same time, it has consistently made sincere efforts for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Chinese People's Volunteers have already completed the first phase of troop withdrawal and are now entering the second phase.

It is the American imperialists who are obstructing the reunification of Korea and hindering our nation from embarking on a brighter future. The American imperialists must immediately withdraw from the land of Korea.

As a glorious member of the powerful socialist camp, the Korean people must drive the American imperialists out of the land of Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Dear Comrades,

Today you are returning to your motherland with great victory and honor. Your victory and honor are the victory and honor of the great Chinese people, which is the great victory of proletarian internationalism and the victory of the people of all socialist camp countries. I propose a toast: to the health of the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and their achievements in future work, to the permanent prosperity of the great People's Republic of China, to the eternal and immortal friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, to the unbreakable and consolidated internationalist unity of the people of the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union, and to lasting peace throughout the world!

    在欢送第二批归国志愿军的宴会上
    金日成首相的讲话
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜内阁首相金日成今晚在欢送中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的中国人民志愿军将军萧应棠同志：亲爱的中国人民志愿军将军谢振华、汪易同志：亲爱的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们：
    我代表朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民，谨向在为朝鲜人民的自由、独立和东方的巩固和平的斗争中建立了丰功伟绩、即将回国的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们，致以深切的感谢和最大的荣誉。
    你们高举着抗美援朝的神圣旗帜跨过鸭绿江后已经七年半了。这些年来，你们同朝鲜人民同甘共苦，表现了无比的英雄气概和勇敢精神，建立了永世不朽的伟大功勋。
    由光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席教导培育下的你们，向全世界人民充分显示了你们是真正的人民军队，是真正的马克思列宁主义党的军队，是真正的国际主义的军队。你们建立的功勋，将和我国的美丽江山一起，永远放射着光芒。你们同朝鲜人民之间结成的深厚友谊，将永远留在朝鲜人民子子孙孙的心中。
    中华人民共和国为了朝鲜人民的自由和幸福，一贯在物质上和精神上给予巨大的帮助。同时，为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，也始终一贯地进行着真挚的努力。中国人民志愿军已经完成第一批撤军，现已进入第二批撤军的阶段。
    阻挠朝鲜的统一，阻挠我们民族走上更加繁荣的明天的道路的，就是美帝国主义者。美帝国主义应当立即从朝鲜的土地上撤出。
    作为强大的社会主义阵营光荣成员的朝鲜人民，一定要把美帝国主义从朝鲜的土地上赶出去，实现祖国的和平统一。
    亲爱的同志们，
    今天你们带着伟大的胜利和荣誉返回自己的祖国。你们的胜利和荣誉就是伟大的中国人民的胜利和荣誉，那也就是无产阶级国际主义伟大的胜利和全体社会主义阵营国家人民的胜利。我建议：为英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们的健康和在今后工作中取得成就，为伟大的中华人民共和国的永久的繁荣，为中国人民和朝鲜人民的永恒不朽的友谊团结，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家人民的牢不可破的、巩固的国际主义团结，为全世界的巩固和平干杯！
