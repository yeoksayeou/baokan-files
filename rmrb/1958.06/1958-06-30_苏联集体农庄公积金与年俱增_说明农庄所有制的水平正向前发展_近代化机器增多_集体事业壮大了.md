Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th – The large increase in Soviet collective farm public accumulation funds marks the continuous improvement of the level of collective farm ownership. The scope of public accumulation funds is also gradually expanding, and their nature is also changing.

For more than twenty years since the implementation of the Soviet collective farm system, the amount of public accumulation funds has increased every year, and the growth rate has increased even more in recent years. In 1932, the total amount of public accumulation funds in collective farms nationwide was 4.7 billion rubles, 21 billion rubles in 1940, and 63 billion rubles in 1952. At the beginning of 1958, the public accumulation funds had reached 100 billion rubles.

The amount of cash in the total public accumulation funds is also increasing every year. For example, in 1952, the cash in the national collective farm public accumulation funds was 7.4 billion rubles, which increased to 16.7 billion rubles in 1956, and has increased to 25 billion rubles this year. The average amount of public accumulation funds per collective farm nationwide was 22,000 rubles in 1932 and more than 1.1 million rubles in 1956.

The nature of public accumulation funds is also changing. In terms of content, an important component of the collective farm public accumulation funds now is various modernized machines, power stations, and public buildings. In terms of the scope of public accumulation funds, it has broken through the scope of one farm, and there are many examples of two or more farms jointly building power stations, roads, irrigation systems, and factories. In the Russian Federation alone, 2,000 collective farms have established public construction organizations and enterprises. In one district of the Kirghiz Republic, eleven farms jointly built a hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of 1,300 kilowatts. These farms invested a total of more than 5.6 million rubles. The investment in construction jointly carried out by two or more farms had reached more than 1 billion rubles at the beginning of 1957. The large-scale emergence of this inter-farm public accumulation fund in recent years shows that the level of farm ownership is developing forward.

The Model Charter of Soviet Agricultural Labor Cooperatives once stipulated that the funds allocated for public accumulation should not exceed 20% of the total income, but this regulation has actually been broken through. In recent years, many collective farms have allocated 30% of their total annual income to public accumulation funds.

Due to the large increase in public accumulation funds, collective farms can not only purchase machines, but also quickly organize many welfare undertakings that require collective efforts to improve the living standards and cultural level of the members. Hundreds of economically strong farms have already begun to improve rural living conditions according to special plans. For example, in many regions of Ukraine, collective farms have established streets according to plans. Many houses are built according to urban standards. The farms have built tap water and sewage facilities. Some farms have begun to establish bread factories and public laundries. Many farms have begun to implement pension systems and regular vacation systems. Some farms in the Kuban region have begun to change from remuneration based on workdays to full cash wages. These are all the results of the rapid increase in public accumulation funds.

    苏联集体农庄公积金与年俱增
    说明农庄所有制的水平正向前发展
    近代化机器增多　集体事业壮大了
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联集体农庄公积金的大量增加标志着集体农庄所有制水平的不断提高。公积金的范围也在逐步扩大，性质也在起着变化。
    苏联集体农庄制度实行二十多年来，公积金的数目每年增加，近年来增长速度更大为提高。1932年，全国集体农庄公积金总数是四十七亿卢布，1940年是二百一十亿卢布，1952年是六百三十亿卢布。1958年初公积金已经达到一千亿卢布。
    公积金总数中现金数目每年也都在增长。例如，1952年全国集体农庄公积金中现金是七十四亿卢布，1956年增加到一百六十七亿卢布，今年已经增加到二百五十亿卢布。全国平均每一个集体农庄的公积金数目1932年是二万二千卢布，1956年是一百一十多万卢布。
    公积金的性质也在发生变化。从内容方面讲，现在集体农庄的公积金的重要组成部分是各种近代化的机器，发电站，公共建筑。就公积金的范围讲，已经突破了一个农庄的范围，出现了两个以上农庄共同修建发电站、道路、灌溉系统和工厂等许多事例。单是在俄罗斯联邦，就有二千个集体农庄成立了公共的建筑组织和企业。吉尔吉斯共和国的一个区里，有十一个农庄共同修建一个发电能力一千三百瓩的水电站。这些农庄共投资五百六十多万卢布。两个以上农庄共同进行的建设的投资在1957年初已经达到十亿多卢布。这种农庄间的公积金在近年来的大量出现说明农庄所有制的水平正在向前发展。
    苏联农业劳动组合模范章程曾经规定提作公积金的款项不超过总收入的20％，现在这个规定实际上已被突破。近年来，许多集体农庄从每年总收入中拨入公积金的款项已达到总收入的30％。
    由于公积金的大量增加使得集体农庄不仅可以购买机器，并且还可能迅速举办许多需要用集体力量举办的提高庄员生活和文化水平的福利事业。数以百计的经济上壮大的农庄已经开始按照专门计划改善乡村居住条件。例如，在乌克兰的许多地区，集体农庄已经按照计划来建立街道。许多住宅是按照城市的标准建筑的。农庄修建了自来水、下水道等设施。有的农庄开始建立面包工厂、公共洗衣房等。许多农庄开始实行养老金制度和定期的休假制度。库班地区有些农庄已经开始由按劳动日计算报酬改为全部现金工资制。这些都是公积金迅速增加的结果。
