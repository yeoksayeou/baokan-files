　　Ceylon Riots Basically Subdued
    Bandaranaike Asks People to Help Restore Order
    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 4th - The riots in northern and eastern Ceylon and other places, caused by the language issue, are gradually returning to normal after the Ceylon authorities took emergency measures to maintain law and order.
    According to a government spokesman on the 3rd, no incidents occurred in Ceylon in the past two days. The Ceylon Parliament will hold a meeting on the 4th to discuss the riots.
    Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike pointed out in a broadcast to the nation on May 30 that the riots that have occurred in Ceylon in the past two weeks "are not entirely spontaneous, and there are deeper problems than the events themselves." He asked the people of Ceylon not to listen to rumors and to help the authorities carry out the task of restoring order. The British magazine "Eastern World" in its February issue revealed the conspiracy of the United States to use the language issue to create division and opposition to the government in Ceylon.

　　锡兰骚乱事件基本平定
    班达拉奈克要求人民帮助恢复秩序
    据新华社4日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰北部和东部等地由于语言问题而发生的骚乱，在锡兰当局采取了维持治安的紧急措施后，局势日趋正常。
    据政府发言人3日宣布，在过去两天中，锡兰全国没有发生任何事件。锡兰议会将在4日举行会议，讨论这次骚乱问题。
    锡兰总理班达拉奈克5月30日在向全国发表广播演说时指出，锡兰在过去两个星期来发生的骚乱事件“不完全是自发的，其中存在着比事件本身还要深刻的问题”。他要求锡兰人民不要听信谣言，并且帮助当局执行恢复秩序的任务。今年2月号的英国“东方世界”杂志，曾经揭露美国利用语言问题在锡兰制造分裂和反对政府行动的阴谋。
