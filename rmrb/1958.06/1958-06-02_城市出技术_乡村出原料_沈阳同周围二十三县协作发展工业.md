Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 31st: Shenyang City and its surrounding twenty-three counties are launching a major industrial collaboration between urban and rural areas. Shenyang will assist various counties in establishing factories and mines with relatively complex technologies, and the counties will become supply bases for Shenyang's industrial raw materials.

　　At the Shenyang Regional Collaboration Conference held from May 8th to 20th, Shenyang City and eighteen counties within the collaboration zone, including Tieling, Xinmin, Kaiyuan, and Beizhen, discussed and signed agreements on strengthening urban-rural collaboration, mutual support, and joint leaps forward. Fuxin, Chaoyang, Beipiao, Jinxi, Jin County, and five other counties outside the Shenyang collaboration zone also rushed to the conference to request technical and equipment support from Shenyang to establish county and township heavy industries such as iron smelting and power stations.

　　Shenyang's state-owned industries, local industries, handicraft cooperatives, universities, colleges, and scientific research departments are truly "doing their best" in supporting county and township industries. They will assist the counties in establishing over 960 factories and mines through technical guidance, surveying and design, chemical analysis, technical personnel training, technical data supply, and equipment supply. Most of these are heavy industry factories and mines such as iron smelting, machinery, fertilizer, power stations, and coal mines, as well as light industry factories with relatively complex technologies such as paper making, alcohol, and rayon.

　　Eighteen counties urgently needed to establish machine repair factories to repair agricultural machinery and factory equipment but were troubled by a lack of skilled workers and equipment. The Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, Heavy Machinery Plant, Shenyang First Industrial Bureau, Handicraft Administration Bureau, and sixteen other units will be responsible for helping them from factory design, production technical guidance, technical personnel training, possible equipment supply, all the way to independent production. Establishing fertilizer plants, power stations, and oil refineries are common requests from various counties. If Shenyang does not have the conditions to provide technical guidance, it will actively find ways to manufacture the required equipment. The Shenyang First Industrial Bureau has already begun to transform the original rivet welding factory into a chemical machinery factory, uniting more than 50 factories in collaboration to manufacture complete sets of fertilizer plant equipment to support the construction of fertilizer plants in various counties. The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, Shenyang Geological Bureau, Shenyang Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, Northeast Institute of Technology, and other units are also assisting the eighteen counties in resource exploration, chemical analysis, design, and mining of 47 mines, according to their respective strengths.

　　After the agreement for Shenyang City to assist the surrounding twenty-three counties in establishing over 960 factories and mines is implemented, the chemical fertilizer produced can be used to increase grain production by more than 450,000 tons. The general machinery and equipment used can be manufactured or repaired by themselves, and an average of more than 70% of farmers can have electric lights. The twenty-seven iron smelting plants built by these counties can produce more than 470,000 tons of steel annually, which can not only meet the needs of the counties but also support Shenyang with 250,000 tons of steel. At the same time, the raw materials for light and heavy industries such as copper, iron, and rayon produced by the counties will be continuously transported to Shenyang from all directions, becoming Shenyang's raw material base.

　　城市出技术  乡村出原料
    沈阳同周围二十三县协作发展工业
    据新华社沈阳31日电　沈阳市同周围的二十三个县，正在展开城乡工业大协作。沈阳市将协助各县兴办各种技术比较复杂的厂矿，各县也将成为沈阳工业原料的供应基地。
    在5月8日到20日召开的沈阳地区协作会议上，沈阳市和铁岭、新民、开原、北镇等协作区内的十八个县，双方对加强城乡协作、互相支援、共同跃进作了讨论，并且签订了协议书。沈阳协作区外的阜新、朝阳、北票、锦西、锦县等五个县，在会议期间也赶来要求沈阳给以技术和设备上的支援，兴办炼铁、电站等县乡重工业。
    沈阳的国营工业、地方工业、手工业社、大专学校、科学研究部门，在支援县乡工业上，真可说是“各尽所能”。他们将从技术指导、勘查设计、化验分析、技术力量培训、技术资料供应、设备供应等方面，帮助各县兴办九百六十多个厂矿，其中多数是炼铁、机械、化肥、电站、煤矿等重工业厂矿，以及造纸、酒精、人造棉等技术比较复杂的轻工业工厂。
    有十八个县急需兴办机修厂，检修农业机械和厂矿设备，可是苦于缺少技术工人和设备。沈阳第一机床厂、重型机器厂、沈阳市第一工业局、手工业管理局等十六个单位，就从建厂设计、生产技术指导、技术力量培训、可能的设备供应、一直到能独立生产，负责帮助到底。兴办化肥厂、发电站、炼油厂是各县普遍要求。沈阳没有条件给予技术指导，就积极想办法制造所需的设备。沈阳市第一工业局已经着手把原有铆焊厂改建成化工机械厂，联合五十多个工厂协作，制造全套化肥厂设备，支援各县建设化肥厂。沈阳煤矿设计院、沈阳地质局、沈阳有色金属试验所、东北工学院等单位，也根据自己的所长，协助十八个县进行四十七个矿山的资源勘查、化验分析、设计、开采矿山的工作。
    沈阳市协助周围二十三个县兴办九百六十多个厂矿的协议实现以后，生产的化学肥料可以用来增产四十五万多吨粮食，所用的一般机器设备都能自己制造或修配，平均有70％以上的农户可以点上电灯。这些县建设的二十七个炼铁厂，每年可以生产四十七万多吨钢铁，不仅能满足各县的需要，还能支援沈阳二十五万吨钢铁。与此同时，各县产的铜、铁、人造棉等轻重工业原料，将从四面八方源源不断地运往沈阳，成为沈阳工业的原料基地。
