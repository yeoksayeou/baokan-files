Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - A vigorous campaign to publicize the general line for socialist construction has been launched in many parts of the country.

　　Changchun and Jilin cities mobilized a propaganda army of 170,000 people in one day to widely publicize the general line in the streets and alleys of the urban area. In Changchun City, more than half of the city's residents, over 500,000 people, were educated on the general line that day. The propaganda army was composed of people from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, government cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, students, and street residents. They compiled many propaganda programs overnight and started propaganda activities early in the morning in densely populated areas such as streets, theaters, stations, and shops. PLA generals explained the basic spirit of the general line to the masses on the streets, which was warmly welcomed.

　　In cities and villages in Zhejiang Province, propaganda teams of thousands of people use various forms to publicize the general line to the masses every day. The propaganda team of more than 1,000 people formed by the Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou city theatrical troupes is very active. On May 30, they performed 80 short and concise programs. From May 30 to June 1, Hangzhou mobilized a propaganda army of 250,000 person-times, and 2.7 million citizens and suburban farmers were educated on the general line. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is summarizing the propaganda experience of the past few days and preparing to mobilize 2,800 speakers in the urban area from the 4th to go deep into the grassroots and carry out further propaganda to the masses.

　　The Jianghan District Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a propaganda team of 5,000 speakers and propagandists, which went deep into factories, shops, teahouses and homes on the 1st, conducting propaganda reports from house to house and distributing leaflets. In one day, 100,000 residents in the district initially learned about the basic content of the general line. Wuhan has used various forms of propaganda in the movement of "Everyone Publicizes the General Line, Everyone Listens to the General Line Propaganda." Xinhua Bookstore, cinemas and theaters, automobiles, and banks have also rushed to produce a large number of bookmarks, slides, banners, and savings certificates for propaganda. New slogans will be posted in various entertainment venues, shop windows, and stations.

　　Party and government responsible cadres in Qinghai Province have recently made reports on the general line to cadres of provincial and Xining municipal organs and active workers in factories and mines.

　　The Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province vigorously publicized and studied the general line in the celebration of the wheat harvest. After the propaganda of the general line, the peasants in various places were even happier and more energetic. In the eastern part of Guanzhong, where wheat has matured, the masses have started to harvest wheat, striving for high yield and harvest.

　　Some representatives of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China from Anhui, Zhejiang, Hebei and other places actively participated in the propaganda activities of the general line after returning to their places. Luo Tengyun, representative of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and director of the Dayuying Agricultural Cooperative in Lai'an County, Anhui Province, added more enthusiasm to the people of Lai'an in the Great Leap Forward after returning to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. After hearing the report, the party members of the Dayuying Agricultural Cooperative were very excited and unanimously guaranteed to produce 1,000 catties per mu this year and realize the agricultural development program ahead of schedule. Wang Zunxian, Secretary of the Shengsi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhejiang Province, who attended the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, crossed the sea to publicize the general line to the vast number of fishermen in the fishing grounds shortly after returning to the county. Geng Changsuo, a representative of the Eighth National Congress, immediately conveyed the spirit of the meeting to the members of the agricultural cooperative he led after returning to the cooperative. The members said excitedly: "The general line is like a lighthouse, which makes people clear-headed and clear in direction, and the confidence and enthusiasm for realizing the great leap forward in agricultural production are even greater." In order to make the great leap forward in production more guaranteed, all the members took out more than 200 yuan of personal savings in just a few days and invested in the township and the community to set up small farm tool factories and agricultural and sideline product processing factories.

　　The Thousand-Person Inspection Group organized by the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, while publicizing the general line, used the general line as the standard to conduct a mass comprehensive inspection and comparison of various tasks. Through this publicity and inspection, a nationwide upsurge in running industries and technological revolution and cultural revolution was further set off, promoting the current production and a comprehensive leap forward in various tasks, and building Lanzhou into a new industrial base as soon as possible.

    新华社3日讯  大张旗鼓地宣传社会主义建设总路线的活动，已经在全国许多地方先后展开。
    长春、吉林两市一日出动了由十七万人组成的宣传大军，在市区大街小巷广泛宣传总路线。在长春市，这一天有占全市居民半数的五十多万人受到了总路线的教育。宣传大军是由工人、农民、机关干部、解放军、学生、街道居民等各界人士组成。他们连夜编排了许多宣传节目，清晨就遍布街头巷尾、影剧院、车站、商店等人口密集的地区开始宣传活动。解放军的将军们在街头向群众讲解总路线的基本精神，受到热烈欢迎。
    在浙江省的城市和农村里，每天都有成千上万人组成的宣传队伍，运用各种形式向群众宣传总路线。浙江省和杭州市各戏剧团体组成的一千多人的宣传队伍，十分活跃。5月30日一天，他们就演出了八十个短小精悍的节目。从5月30日到6月1日的三天中，杭州市共出动了宣传大军二十五万人次，受到总路线教育的市民和郊区农民有二百七十万人次。中共杭州市委正在总结这几天的宣传经验，准备从4日起，市区两千八百个报告员一齐出动，深入基层，向群众作进一步的宣传。
    中共武汉市江汉区委组织的一支包括五千个报告员和宣传员的宣传队伍，1日分别深入到工厂、商店、茶馆和家庭，挨家挨户地进行宣传报告，散发传单，在一天里，使这个区的十万居民初步了解到总路线的基本内容。武汉市在“人人宣传总路线、人人听总路线宣传”运动中，运用了各种宣传形式。新华书店、各电影院和剧场、汽车以及银行等也都赶制大批书签、幻灯、横幅和储蓄券，进行宣传。各文娱场所、商店橱窗、车站码头都将张贴新的标语。
    青海省的党政负责干部，最近已向省级和西宁市的机关干部、厂矿中的工人积极分子作了有关总路线的报告。
    陕西关中地区在欢庆小麦丰收中大张旗鼓地宣传和学习总路线。经过总路线的宣传，各地农民更加喜上添喜，精神百倍。小麦已成熟的关中东部，群众已纷纷动手割麦，争取做到丰产丰收，颗粒还家。
    安徽、浙江、河北等地的一些中共“八大”代表从北京回到原地后，更积极地参加了总路线的宣传活动。中共“八大”代表、安徽省来安县大余营农业社主任骆腾云回来传达了八大二次会议的精神以后，给跃进中的来安人民增添了更足的干劲。大余营农业社的党员听到传达后，十分振奋，一致保证今年亩产一千斤，提前实现农业发展纲要。列席中共八大二次会议的中共浙江省嵊泗县委书记王尊贤回县后不久，就飘洋过海，向渔场的广大渔民宣传总路线。“八大”代表耿长锁回到他领导的农业社后，立即向社员们传达了会议精神。社员们兴奋地说：“总路线像灯塔，使人心明眼亮，方向明确，实现农业生产大跃进的信心和干劲更大了”，为了使生产大跃进更有保障，全体社员在短短几天内就拿出二百多元个人储蓄，投资给乡和社兴办小型的农具工厂和农副产品加工厂。
    中共兰州市委组织的千人检查团，在宣传总路线的同时，以总路线为标准，对各项工作进行群众性的全面大检查，大评比。通过这次宣传和检查，进一步掀起全民大办工业和技术革命、文化革命的热潮，推动当前生产和各项工作全面大跃进，尽快地把兰州建设成为新兴的工业基地。
