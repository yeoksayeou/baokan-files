    Tianjin Uses Ordinary Equipment to Make Silicon Steel Sheets

    (Our dispatch) Tianjin has used ordinary equipment to produce silicon steel sheets, an important raw material in the electrical appliance industry. This pioneering feat shattered the mysterious idea that silicon steel sheets could not be produced without special equipment and advanced technology, opening up a simple path for the widespread production of silicon steel sheets in industrial cities across the country. The First Ministry of Commerce, the Second Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently jointly held an on-site meeting in Tianjin to promote this experience. This will enable the production of silicon steel sheets to flourish in cities throughout our country.

    Silicon steel sheets are an indispensable and important raw material for power equipment. Only Anshan and Taiyuan in China have small-scale production, and most of it relies on imports. This year, under the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, industrial production and rural power stations require a large amount of power equipment, and the supply of silicon steel sheets has become strained.

    In response to this situation, the Tianjin Xinxing Steel Plant sent workers and technicians to the Taiyuan Steel Plant to learn how to refine silicon steel. The staff of the Tianjin Transportation Electrical Equipment Purchasing and Supply Station also organized a special group to contact Tianjin universities, electrical industry research institutes, and other units to collect relevant domestic and foreign technical information on silicon steel sheet production for research. After the workers of the Xinxing Steel Plant returned to the factory after studying in Taiyuan for a week, they immediately started trial refining. They learned to use electric furnaces to refine silicon steel in Taiyuan, but they used converters during the trial refining. After taking appropriate treatment methods, they refined a batch of high-quality silicon steel in less than 20 minutes. The smelting time was shorter than using an electric furnace, and the cost per ton was reduced by more than 50%.

    After the special group of Tianjin Transportation Electrical Appliance Station painstakingly studied the collected materials, they also sorted out a set of technical data for refining silicon steel, and with the strong assistance of the Tongda Magnet Steel Factory, which uses crucibles to refine magnet steel, they used 300-tael crucibles to refine silicon steel. The jointly owned small rolling mill overcame the difficulties of backward equipment and further rolled this silicon steel into silicon steel sheets with a thickness of 0.5 mm and 0.35 mm. An electric hair dryer made of this silicon steel sheet has been tested and proven to be effective and meets the standards.

    Representatives from ten provinces and cities who attended the on-site meeting in Tianjin emancipated their minds and completely broke the "conditional theory" for the production of silicon steel sheets through on-site visits and practical operations. They saw with their own eyes that the Xinxing Steel Plant used a converter to refine silicon steel, and when casting silicon steel ingots, they used 4-inch small molds instead of 10-inch large molds, and no cracking occurred. The representatives unanimously believed that any steel plant could produce silicon steel. Yao Yilin, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Commerce, made a report at the on-site meeting, calling on representatives from all regions to take immediate action after returning to their locations, try to produce silicon steel sheets, and at the same time further study and improve the quality of silicon steel sheets.

### 天津用普通设备制成矽钢片

    天津用普通设备制成矽钢片
    本报讯　天津市用普通设备制成了电器工业生产中的重要原料——矽钢片。这一创举打破了非有特殊设备和高深技术不能生产矽钢片的神秘观点，为全国各工业城市普遍生产矽钢片开辟了简捷的道路。第一商业部、第二商业部和冶金工业部最近在天津联合召开现场会议，推广了这一经验。这将使我国矽钢片生产在城市中普遍开花。
    矽钢片是电力设备不可缺少的重要原料，国内只有鞍山、太原有少量生产，大部分依靠进口。今年在工农业大跃进的形势下，工业生产和农村电站都需要大量电力设备，矽钢片供应便显得紧张了。
    针对这种情况，天津新兴钢厂派了工人和技术人员到太原钢厂学习炼矽钢；天津交通电工器材采购供应站的职工也组织了专门小组，同天津各高等学校、电气工业试验所等单位联系，收集有关生产矽钢片的国内外技术资料进行研究。新兴钢厂的工人在太原学习一个星期回厂以后，立即动手试炼。他们在太原学的是用电炉炼矽钢，试炼时改用了转炉。经过采取适当的处理方法，结果用不到二十分钟的时间就炼出了一炉优质矽钢。冶炼时间比用电炉节省，每吨成本还降低50％以上。
    天津交电站的专门小组对收集来的资料进行刻苦钻研以后，也整理出了一套炼矽钢的技术资料，并在用坩埚炼磁钢的同大磁钢厂的大力协助下，利用三百两的坩埚炼出了矽钢。公私合营小型轧板厂克服了设备落后的困难，进一步用这种矽钢轧制成了厚度零点五米厘和零点三五米厘的矽钢片。用这种矽钢片制成的电动吹风机，经试验证明，效果良好，合乎标准。
    到天津参加现场会议的十个省市的代表，通过现场参观和实际操作，解放了思想，彻底打破了对矽钢片生产的“条件论”。他们亲眼看到：新兴钢厂用转炉炼出了矽钢，浇铸矽钢锭的时候，用四吋小模代替十吋大模，也没有发生碎裂。代表们一致认为，凡是钢厂就能生产矽钢。第一商业部副部长姚依林在现场会议上作报告，号召各地代表回去以后立即行动起来，试制矽钢片，同时要进一步研究提高矽钢片的质量。　（吕素瑄）
