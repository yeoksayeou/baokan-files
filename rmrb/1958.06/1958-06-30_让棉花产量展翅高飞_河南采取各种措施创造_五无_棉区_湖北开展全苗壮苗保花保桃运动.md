    Let Cotton Production Soar
    Henan Takes Various Measures to Create "Five-Free" Cotton Areas
    Hubei Launches a Campaign for Full Seedling Emergence, Strong Seedlings, and Protection of Flowers and Bolls

    (Our report) Farmers in cotton-producing areas of Henan Province are extensively launching cotton field management activities centered on creating "five-free" cotton areas (free of soil compaction and weeds, free of diseases and pests, free of excessive vegetative growth, free of drought and flood disasters, and free of third-class cotton seedlings), striving to make this year's cotton production soar.

    Based on the unprecedented bumper wheat harvest in the province this year, cotton farmers in various parts of Henan have further recognized the potential of the land and liberated their thinking. In order to create more "five-free" cotton areas as quickly as possible, various localities held cotton production battlefield conferences in mid-June, conducted major inspections of cotton fields, and launched debates on the great leap forward in cotton production, thereby further promoting cotton field management. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have organized cotton management professional teams and established land section responsibility systems to ensure that each plot is managed by a designated person. The following specific measures have been adopted: First, a universal insect pest monitoring network has been established to do a good job of pest forecasting and supply of pesticides and machinery, seize favorable opportunities, and completely eliminate pests such as cotton aphids, cotton bollworms, plant bugs, and red spiders. Second, diligently loosen the soil and weed frequently, requiring seven to nine cultivations. Third, in cotton field management, implement the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, classifying and ranking the cotton seedlings, strengthening topdressing and watering of weak cotton seedlings, expanding the number of first-class seedlings, improving second-class seedlings, and eliminating third-class seedlings. Strive for each cotton plant to produce ten to thirty large bolls. Fourth, immediately improve cotton field drought resistance and flood control facilities to ensure that irrigation is possible in drought and drainage is possible in floods. Fifth, meticulously prune, top at the right time, and remove excessive vegetative growth at any time to ensure ventilation and light penetration in the cotton fields and reduce bud and boll shedding.

    Currently, more than 13 million mu of cotton seedlings in Henan are growing vigorously, reaching a height of about one foot, with generally three or four fruiting branches per plant, and some already flowering and budding. In Anyang County, 100,000 farmers participate in field management work such as pest control, weeding, and topdressing every day. In Qingfeng County of Xinxiang Prefecture, 98.2% of the 217,000 mu of cotton fields have reached the "five-free" cotton field standard. On the 4.5 million mu of cotton fields in the provincial cotton high-yield demonstration areas, on the basis of applying more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, topdressing has been universally increased once or twice.

    (Our report) Nearly 9 million mu of cotton in Hubei Province is growing well, with most cotton seedlings having grown five or six true leaves, and many areas have begun to bud. At present, various localities are further strengthening cotton field management, striving to achieve the cotton leap forward plan.

    In April this year, just when cotton was being sown, Hubei was hit by wind and rain, followed by varying degrees of drought. Due to the impact of the climate, various diseases and insect pests of cotton in Hubei Province occurred early and were widespread. In view of this situation, the county party secretaries in charge of cotton production in many counties personally led township and commune cadres and technicians to go deep into the cotton fields to check the damage to cotton seedlings and study prevention and control methods. Macheng County, which had already achieved a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year, also launched a mass competition movement, striving to become a "double hundred jin" county of ginned cotton this year.

    At present, cotton in Hubei Province is growing better than in any previous year. However, in order to further improve cotton field cultivation and management and strive for a great cotton harvest, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a provincial cotton on-site meeting. The cotton production in Xinzhou, Macheng, Tianmen and other counties was visited and inspected successively, the experience of cotton field management was summarized and exchanged, and various right-leaning conservative ideas were criticized. The meeting required all localities to continue to carry out the movement of full seedling emergence, uniform seedling emergence, strong seedlings, and protection of buds, flowers, and bolls. In this regard, the meeting especially emphasized that all localities must continuously classify and rank cotton seedlings, make every effort to eliminate backward fields, and achieve balance between communes and between plots; cotton scattered production areas should immediately send additional personnel and establish professional teams, so that these areas can also quickly catch up.

    让棉花产量展翅高飞
    河南采取各种措施创造“五无”棉区
    湖北开展全苗壮苗保花保桃运动
    本报讯　河南省产棉地区农民正广泛展开以创造地无板结和杂草，无病虫、无疯杈赘芽、无旱涝灾害、无三类棉苗的“五无”棉区为中心的棉田管理活动，力争今年的棉花产量展翅高飞。
    河南各地棉农在今年全省小麦空前大丰收的基础上，进一步认识了土地潜力，解放了思想。为了尽快地创造出更多的“五无”棉区，各地在6月中旬，都普遍举行了棉花生产战地会议，进行了棉田大检查，并开展了棉花生产大跃进的辩论，从而进一步推动了棉田管理。各地农业社都组织了棉花管理专业队，建立地段责任制，达到块块有专人管理；并采取以下几项具体措施：一、普遍建立虫情测报网，做好虫情预报和药械供应工作，掌握有利时机，彻底消灭棉蚜、棉铃虫、盲椿象、红蜘蛛等害虫。二、勤松土、勤锄草，要求中耕七至九遍。三、在棉田管理上，贯彻抓两头带中间的方法，分类站队，对瘦弱棉苗加强追肥、浇水，扩大一类苗，提高二类苗，消灭三类苗。争取每株棉花结大桃十至三十个。四、立即作好棉田抗旱防涝设施，做到旱能灌溉，涝能排水；五、精细整枝，适时打顶，随时打去疯杈赘芽，保证棉田通风透光，减少蕾铃脱落。
    目前，河南一千三百多万亩棉花苗儿生长肥旺，高达尺许，一般每株有三、四个果枝，有的已开花现蕾。安阳县每天参加治虫、锄草、追肥等田间管理工作的农民达十万人。新乡专区的清丰县二十一万七千亩棉花达到“五无”棉田标准的占98.2％。全省棉花丰产示范区的四百五十万亩棉田，在每亩施底肥一万多斤的基础上，又普遍增施追肥一次或二次。　（曲明振）
    本报讯　湖北省近九百万亩棉花生长良好，棉苗大都已长出五、六片真叶，不少地区已经开始现蕾。目前，各地正进一步加强棉田管理，力争棉花跃进规划的实现。
    今年4月间，正值棉花播种时，湖北各地遭到了风、雨袭击，接着又出现了程度不同的旱象。由于气候的影响，湖北省棉花各种病、虫害发生得早而普遍。根据这一情况，许多县专管棉花生产的县委书记，亲自带领乡、社干部和技术人员，深入棉田检查棉苗受害情况，研究防治办法。去年就已达到亩产皮棉百斤的麻城县，还开展了群众性的竞赛运动，力争今年成为双百斤“皮棉”县。
    目前，湖北省棉花长得比过去哪一年都好。但是，为了更进一步做好棉田培育管理，争取棉花大丰产，最近，中共湖北省委召开了全省棉花现场会议。先后参观、检查了新洲、麻城、天门等县的棉花生产，总结交流了棉田管理经验，批判了各种各样右倾保守思想。会议要求各地继续开展全苗、齐苗、壮苗和保蕾、保花、保桃运动。在这方面，会议特别强调：各地必须不断地对棉苗分类排队，一股劲地消灭落后田，作到社社平衡，丘丘平衡；棉花分散产区，应立即加派力量，建立专业班子，使这些地区也迅速地跟上来。
