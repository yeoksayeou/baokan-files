Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Early rice across 1.7 million mu in the Longxi Special District along the Jiulong River in Fujian Province is generally ripe and harvesting has begun a season earlier than in previous years. According to yield statistics from the first harvested 7,000+ mu of early rice, yields have generally increased by 70-80% compared to last year, with many high-yield fields discovered producing over 1,000 jin per mu. As of June 19th, incomplete statistics from ten townships in Longxi, Haicheng, and Zhangpu counties show that 88.119 mu of early rice had yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu. After inspection, weighing, and land measurement, the highest yield reached 1,560 jin and one liang per mu, while the lowest was 1,061 jin and four liang per mu.

The reason these early rice yields were able to surpass 1,000 jin per mu is mainly due to the fact that during the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members were full of energy and continuously struggled against conservative thinking, boldly implementing technical innovations.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 22nd: The Huoju (Torch) Youth Production Team of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, harvested 2.07 mu of experimental early rice fields on the 17th. After drying the crop twice, the actual yield of dry grain was 3,229.6 jin, averaging 1,560.2 jin per mu, setting the highest record for early rice harvested in the province so far.

The township head, Huang Yezhen, Haicheng County Agricultural Bureau cadre Hong Dexiu, and farmers participated in the inspection on the day of the harvest. On the 20th, Liu Bingren, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Longxi Prefectural Party Committee, and others arrived at the cooperative for further inspection and measured the land.

This experimental early rice field was jointly cultivated by Yan Delong, Deputy Secretary of the Haicheng County Party Committee, Pan A'tie, Captain of the Huoju Youth Production Team, technician Pan Damu, and township and cooperative cadres and experienced farmers. The soil was turned and sun-dried twice during winter cultivation. During spring cultivation, 800 dan of dry river mud, 1,000 jin of duck manure, 320 jin of plant ash, and 35 dan of human manure were used. When sowing, the superior Nantao variety was used for single-plant propagation and direct seeding with a close planting density of 6 x 6.25. Ten days after sowing, seedling arrangement and replanting were carried out to maintain eight to nine rice seedlings per clump. Over the past 100 days, the field was cultivated four times, top-dressed three times, and continuously dried for nearly 40 days with a cycle of three days wet and two days dry to prevent lodging and eliminate pests and diseases, finally creating a high-yield record that increased production by 68% compared to last year's early rice yield of 925 jin per mu.

    九龙江畔早稻丰收
    黎明社创亩产1560斤纪录
    综合新华社消息  福建省九龙江两畔的龙溪专区一百七十万亩早稻已经普遍黄熟，并已比往年提前一个节令开镰收割。据最先收割的七千多亩早稻产量统计，一般都比去年增产七、八成，并且发现许多亩产千斤以上的高额丰产田。到19日止，仅据龙溪、海澄和漳浦等县的十个乡镇不完全统计，有八十八亩一分九厘早稻亩产达到千斤以上，经过验收过秤和土地丈量结果，其中最高亩产量达一千五百六十斤零一两，最低亩产一千零六十一斤四两。
    这些早稻亩产量所以能跨过千斤，主要是由于广大农业社社员在生产大跃进中，鼓足干劲，不断与保守思想作斗争，大胆实行技术革新的结果。
    新华社福州22日电  福建省海澄县黎明农业社火炬青年生产队，17日收割了二亩零七厘试验田的早稻，翻晒了两次后实收干谷三千二百二十九斤六两，平均亩产达到一千五百六十斤零二两，创目前这个省已收早稻的最高纪录。
    收割的那一天，乡长黄野贞、县农业局干部洪德修和农民一起参加了验收。20日中共龙溪地委宣传部副部长刘秉仁等到达这个社再次检查，并丈量了土地。
    这块早稻试验田，是中共海澄县委副书记颜德隆和火炬青年生产队队长潘阿铁、技术员潘大目以及乡社干部、老农等共同种植的。冬耕时曾二次翻土晒土，春耕中用干河泥八百担、鸭粪一千斤、草木灰三百二十斤、人粪肥三十五担。播种时用单本繁殖的南特号良种直播，密植为6×6.25。播种后十日，进行了整苗补苗，保持每丛八至九株禾苗。百天以来，进行了四次中耕，三度追肥，三天湿二天干的连续烤田近四十天，防止了倒伏，扑灭了病虫害，终于创造了比去年早稻亩产九百二十五斤增产六成八的高产纪录。
