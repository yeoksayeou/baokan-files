Factories Illuminate Farmers' Hearts
    ——A Visit to the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative After Establishing Industry
　　By our reporters Fang Chen, Shu Ti
    No Longer the Old Way
    Walking for about an hour from the South Gate of Ding County, Hebei Province, one enters the Hanjiawa Agricultural Production Cooperative. This area was historically known as "Bran Quyang, Vegetables Dingzhou," once filled with sandy slopes where "planting a gourd yields a dipper," and the crops grew like sparse hair on a bald head. But now, looking into the distance, white clouds float in the sky, and wheat waves rise and fall on the ground. Along the way, we saw: newly built roads more than a丈 (zhàng, approx. 3.3 meters) wide stretching in all directions, and newly erected power poles extending into the distance. Motor sounds came from the pumping stations, but no people or animals were seen beside the wells, yet water flowed along the channels to the fields with a whooshing sound.

    Seeing the crops here is truly delightful. The seedlings hide our chests, and the wheat ears are thick and long.

    Beside the road, a group of male and female farmers were digging a long, deep pit. This was a sweet potato experimental plot. They planned to spread twelve layers of fertilizer and twelve layers of soil in the pit. After planting sweet potatoes, it is said that each mu (approx. 0.067 hectares) can yield 120,000 jin (approx. 60,000 kg).

    Another Revolution
    The director of the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative is Ma Baoshan, a model agricultural laborer in Hebei Province. Since the agricultural cooperative set up factories, he has been even busier. We could only talk to him for a few short moments at the edge of the fields, in the factories, or late at night.

    The first time we met was in a small room next to the office. Under the kerosene lamp, this thirty-one-year-old farmer could not suppress his inner joy and said, "Our cooperative's crops grow so well that you like them because the cooperative has built a new 84-kilowatt thermal power plant. In the past, watering the fields depended on two things: the weather and people. Relying on the weather was unreliable, and relying on people was never enough. Now, as long as you pull the switch, you can irrigate with small amounts of water frequently, which is even more effective than a dragon fetching water." This power plant supplies electricity to all twenty-six machine wells in the cooperative, irrigating more than 1,800 mu of land a day. If relying on people, it would take at least 1,800 full laborers. The power plant freed up a large number of laborers for the agricultural cooperative, deep plowing all of the cooperative's more than 5,700 mu of wheat fields and more than 5,000 mu of sweet potato fields to a depth of one chi (approx. 0.33 meters) and two or three chi, applying fertilizer layer by layer, and spreading soil layer by layer, so that the average wheat field could yield 300 to 400 jin per mu, and sweet potatoes could yield about 10,000 jin. This is a large-scale, high-yield that has not been seen in the Ding County area for thousands of years. Ma Baoshan excitedly told us, "The cooperative's average yield of 1,300 jin per mu, and striving for a leap forward plan of 2,000 jin, is inevitable. Even with the most conservative estimate of the yield of more than 5,000 mu of sweet potato fields, it will exceed the cooperative's total output last year."

    The Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative is a joint village cooperative consisting of nine villages, with more than 5,700 people, more than 2,200 full laborers, and more than 12,000 mu of cultivated land. Since the beginning of this year, it has successively built a power plant, an agricultural machinery repair factory, a cement factory, sewing groups, and a shoe factory, plus the original brick factory and agricultural sideline sugar factory, flour mill, etc., a total of forty-four. There is also a grain and feed processing factory that will soon be put into operation.

    All the factories, except for the original sugar factory, flour mill, etc., in Ma Baoshan's words, "are auxiliary factories of the agricultural cooperative," and directly serve the innovation of agricultural production technology and the liberation of rural labor.

    In our contact with the farmers, we deeply felt that industry entering the agricultural cooperative has initiated a huge transformation in the agricultural production situation that has relied on manual labor and animal power for thousands of years.

    Relying Only on Human Power, Crops Cannot Turn Over
    All the cultivated land in the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative relies on well water for irrigation. Last spring, the sky refused to rain, and the wheat drooped its head, thirsty for water. All the men, women, and children of the cooperative were drawing water day and night. Many cooperative members' shoulders were swollen high, and their feet were blistered, but they still couldn't keep up; they watered the front, and the back dried up; they took care of the wheat, but couldn't take care of the corn. In this way, more than 100 mu of cornfields in the cooperative were not watered even once. Ma Baoshan recalled his mood at that time, saying, "In those days, I was always thinking: since the realization of cooperation, because of the lack of machines, the annual yield per mu of land has always fluctuated around 400 jin. Is this a long-term solution? Relying only on human power, crops cannot turn over."

    One day, Ma Baoshan came back from the field, and a group of children surrounded him and sang a folk song: "What kind of rice is eaten? Yam dried rice is eaten; What kind of work is done? Small water wheels are pushed; Whose cooperative is joined? Director Ma Baoshan." While listening, Ma Baoshan replied in his heart: "Sing, sing, when the cooperative starts factories in the future, you will sing something else." In those days, he had plans to build a small thermal power plant, realize the electrification and mechanization of irrigation throughout the cooperative.

    After the autumn harvest, the farmers saw that the cooperative had several hundred mu of land irrigated by gas engines and coal-fired machines driving water pumps. Planting the same crops and applying the same fertilizer, each mu of land yielded more than 100 jin more. Many cooperative members asked to add more machines. Seventy-two-year-old Wang Laochong even proposed to Ma Baoshan: "Do not distribute dividends for one or two years, but also make machines."

    With the active support of the cooperative members, the agricultural cooperative set up factories. This year, when the generator drove the water pump to start irrigating the fields, Zhang Changhe, a wealthy middle peasant who had applied to withdraw from the cooperative last year because he could not irrigate the land, resolutely requested to rejoin the cooperative. There is a sixty-year-old Liang Shipo in the cooperative, who has always been superstitious. This time, she also happily said: "Praying to gods requires chanting spells and burning talismans, and even if you kowtow until your head is broken, it is not certain that it will rain. Now, when the electric gate is turned on, the water comes rolling in. Truly, human ability is better than divine ability." The children no longer sang the folk song "Director Ma Baoshan," but clapped their hands and started to say a rhythmic storytelling: "It's really rare, really rare! When the electric gate is turned on, the well water spurts upwards, watering the wheat until it smiles, making the little donkey cry out. If you ask what's going on, it's because the cooperative built a power station."

    To a Higher Level
    When the wheat was flowering, the workers in the cooperative's agricultural machinery repair factory launched a labor competition to rush to repair and make agricultural tools for the summer harvest. The three iron-making furnaces were filled with flames all day long, and the hammer sound clanged, rushing to repair small cart axles, and making hoes and shovels. Thirteen carpenters and blacksmiths competed to repair windmills and manufacture various threshing agricultural tools. The machine repair workers were not to be outdone, repairing and assembling threshing machines and other summer harvest machinery. Ma Baoshan said: "Last year, the cooperative did not have a repair factory, and if an agricultural tool broke a screw, it had to be sent to the city for repair. In this way, the originally insufficient summer harvest agricultural tools felt even more insufficient; we had to let the old ladies beat the wheat with clubs, and the girls rub the crops with washboards. This year's wheat harvest will definitely not lack this and that like last year."

    Now, the seventeen sewing machines in the three sewing groups are also working tirelessly to rush to make summer clothing for the cooperative members. The cement factory has also begun to produce low-grade cement. While the cooperative members are very happy about the successive start of these factories, Ma Baoshan feels "both happy and worried." He is happy that the cooperative has factories, the crops have turned over, and the farmers have also turned over; he is worried about how to manage so many factories. But he then said: "As a Communist Party member, with the leadership of the Party, any difficulties can be overcome; moreover, this difficulty is bought with money that we are happy to spend. We dare to engage in industry, and we can learn the ability to manage industry."

    "Now all the farmers in the cooperative are overcoming this difficulty. More than 130 cooperative members are learning electrical and mechanical repair knowledge in the cooperative-run technical revolution school every night, and more cooperative members are learning in practice. I am a scientific illiterate. I have to learn everything about industry. For example, there are foreign words on the generator, so I, a farmer, have to learn a little ABCD, otherwise, I can't start the machine and manage the factory."

    Ma Baoshan is learning all the time. He learns electrical and mechanical repair knowledge in the technical school at night; he goes to the power plant and repair factory to check work during the day, and learns operational knowledge; he not only learns from workers and technicians, but also learns from some middle school students in the cooperative. Now, he has learned a lot of electrical knowledge. When introducing the work of the power plant to us, he uses the terms and terminology about transformers, high-voltage bottles, three-phase reverse switches, short circuits, and wire pinching quite appropriately. He said: "Agriculture is our main task, but only by understanding industry can industry better serve agriculture."

    A More Beautiful Future
    One evening before leaving, in a casual chat with Ma Baoshan, we unexpectedly obtained some materials. When we talked about the future countryside of the motherland, Ma Baoshan became excited. He jumped off the kang (a traditional heated platform bed), and described the cooperative's industrial development prospects. He said: "Recently, the Ding County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to realize 'Nine Transformations' and 'Four Networks' in the county within one to four years (note). We should realize the Party's call in advance." He counted on his fingers and told us that electrification and mechanization of water conservancy and irrigation have been realized, and telephone networks and broadcasting networks have been established; mechanization of agricultural product processing can be realized soon, chemicalization of fertilizers will be realized next year, and rubber-tire transportation vehicles will be realized, etc. The more he said, the happier he became, and the more excited he became. As the old saying goes: "'People on the millstone, donkeys on the grinder' (describing heavy work). In the past, the women of our cooperative pushed water wheels all day, and had to push millstones and cook at night, but now they are going to be liberated." "In the future, the cooperative will train a few more young people, buy a few hair clippers, and let the young men all have parted hair. How beautiful that would be!" "But how will the crops grow in the future?" We interjected a question. Ma Baoshan humorously recited two nursery rhymes that have recently become popular in the cooperative as an answer: "One yam fills a basket, one corn stalk breaks through the house."

    Note: "Nine Transformations" are: irrigation self-flowing, mechanization, electrification, mechanization of agricultural product processing, chemicalization of fertilizers, rubber-tire transportation vehicles, mechanization of cultivation, mechanization of harvesting, and electrification of the whole county; "Four Networks" are: telephone network, broadcasting network, transportation network, and telephone conference network.

    工厂照亮了农民的心
    ——访办起工业以后的韩家洼农业社
　　本报记者　方辰　舒倜
    再不是旧样子
    从河北省定县南关步行约一小时，就进入韩家洼农业生产合作社。这一带历史上有“糠曲阳、菜定州”之称，曾经到处是“种一葫芦收一瓢”的砂坡，种的庄稼像秃子的头发，稀稀拉拉。可是，现在哩，极目远望，天上白云飘飘，地面麦浪起伏。一路行来，只见：一条条新修的一丈多宽的大道四通八达，一排排新竖的电线杆子向远方伸展开去。一座座水泵房里传来马达的声音，井台旁边却不见人畜，水，却沿着渠道哗哗地流向田间。
    看到这里的庄稼，真叫人欢喜，苗秸掩过我们的胸部，麦穗儿又粗又长。
    路旁，一伙男女农民正在挖一条长溜溜的深坑，这是一块甘薯试验地，他们准备在深坑里撒上十二层肥、十二层土，栽上甘薯以后，据说，每亩能收十二万斤。
    又一次革命
    韩家洼农业社的社长，是河北省农业劳动模范马保山。自从农业社里办起了工厂，他更加忙了。我们只能在田边、工厂里、或是在深夜，才能在短促的时间内跟他谈上几句话。
    第一次见面是在办公室旁边的一间小屋里，在煤油灯下，这位三十一岁的农民，压不住内心的喜悦，说：“咱社里庄稼长得使你们看了喜欢，是因为社里新建了一个八十四瓩的火力发电厂。过去浇地，一靠天、二靠人；靠天靠不上，靠人老不够。现在，只要把电闸子一拉，要小水勤浇，就给它个小水勤浇，真比龙取水还灵。”这个发电厂供应全社二十六个机井的电力，一天能浇田一千八百多亩，要是靠人，至少也得用一千八百多个整劳动力。发电厂使这个农业社腾出了大批劳动力，把全社五千七百多亩小麦田和五千多亩甘薯地深耕了一尺和二、三尺深，层层施肥，层层撒土，使平均每亩小麦田，能收三、四百斤，甘薯能收万斤左右。这是定县一带几千年来所没有过的大面积的高额产量。马保山兴奋地告诉我们：“社里平均亩产一千三百斤，争取两千斤的跃进规划，是跑不掉了，就以五千多亩甘薯地的最保守的产量来估计，也会超过去年全社的总产量。”
    韩家洼农业社是由九个村庄组成的联村社，共有五千七百多人，二千二百多个整劳动力，耕田一万二千多亩。今年以来，先后兴建了发电厂、农具机械修配厂、水泥厂、缝纫组、鞋厂，加上原有的砖厂和农业副业性的糖厂、粉坊等共四十四个。还有一个粮食和饲料加工厂即将开工。
    所有的工厂，除原有的糖厂、粉坊等以外，用马保山的说法“都是农业社的辅助工厂”，都直接为革新农业生产技术和解放农村劳动力服务。
    我们在同农民的接触中深深地感到，工业进了农业社，使几千年来以手工劳动和畜力为主的农业生产状况开始了一个巨大的变革。
    光靠人力庄稼翻不了身
    韩家洼农业社的耕地，全部要靠井水灌溉。去年春天，老天老不下雨，小麦低了头要水喝，全社男女老少昼夜车水，很多社员肩膀肿得老高，脚底磨起了泡，还是顾得吹笛，顾不了捏眼；浇了前面，干了后面；顾了麦子，顾不了玉米。就这样，社里还有一百多亩玉米地连一滴水也没有浇上。马保山回顾那时的心情说：“在那些日子里，心里老是嘀咕：实现合作化以来，因为缺少机器，每年每亩田的产量，总是在四百斤左右摇来摆去。这是长远办法吗？光靠人力，庄稼是翻不了身的。”
    一天，马保山从田里回来，一群孩子围着他在唱山歌：“吃的什么饭？吃的山药干；干的什么活？推的小水车；入的谁的社？社长马保山。”马保山一面听，一面心里回答：“唱吧，唱吧，将来社里闹起了工厂，你们就会唱别的了。”在那些日子里，他就有了兴建小型火力发电厂、实现全社灌溉电气化、机械化的打算。
    秋收以后，农民们看到社里有几百亩用煤气机、锅驼机带动水泵浇水的田，种同样庄稼，施同样肥料，每亩田却多收了一百多斤，很多社员就要求增添机器。七十二岁的王老充还向马保山提出：“一、二年内不分红，也要闹机器”。
    在社员们的积极支持下，农业社里办起了工厂。今年，当发电机带动水泵开始浇田的时候，有一户曾经在去年因为浇不上地而申请退社的富裕中农张长和，就坚决要求重新入社。社里有一个六十多岁的梁师婆，此人一向迷信，这次也高兴地说：“求神还得念咒烧符，叩破头，还不一定有雨。这会儿，把电门一开，水就滚滚地来了，真是神能不如人能。”孩子们再也不唱“社长马保山”的山歌了，而是拍着手说起了快板：“真稀奇，真稀罕！电门一打开，井水往上窜，浇得麦子裂嘴笑，气得小驴呜喽呱啦直叫喊，要问这是咋回事，就是社里修了发电站”。
    再上一层楼
    当小麦正在扬花的时候，社里农具机械修配厂的工人们就展开了突击抢修、赶制夏收农具的劳动竞赛，三盘铁匠炉终日炉火融融，锤声叮当，抢修小车车轴，赶制镐、锹。十三个木匠和铁匠们比着修理风车和制造各种打场农具，机修工人们也不甘落后地在修配脱谷机等夏收机械。马保山说：“去年社里没有修配厂，农具坏了一个螺丝还得送到城里去修。这样，原来就不够的夏收农具就感到更不够了；只得让老大娘用棒槌打麦子，姑娘们用洗衣板搓庄稼。今年麦收，决不会像去年那样缺这缺那了。”
    现在，三个缝纫组的十七台缝纫机也在整日不息地为社员们赶制夏季衣裤。水泥厂也已开始生产低标号水泥。这些工厂的陆续开工，在社员们十分高兴的同时，马保山却感到“又高兴，又发愁”。他高兴的是社里有了工厂，庄稼翻了身，庄稼汉也翻了身；发愁的是这么多工厂咋管。但是他接着就说：“作为一个共产党员，有党的领导，什么困难都能克服；何况这个困难是咱们高高兴兴地用钱买来的。我们敢于闹工业，我们就能够学会管工业的本领。”
    “现在全社农民都在克服这个困难，有一百三十多个社员每天晚上在社办的技术革命学校里学习电气和机械修理的知识，更多的社员在实践中学习。咱是个科学文盲，对于工业什么都得学，例如发电机上有洋文，于是咱这个农民也只好学一点ABCD，要不，就开不好机器，管不好工厂。”
    马保山无时无刻不在学习，他晚上在技术学校里学习电气和机械修理的知识；白天到发电厂修配厂去检查工作，就一面学习操作方面的知识；他不仅向工人和技术人员学习，也向社里的一些中学生学习。现在，他已经懂得了不少电业知识，在向我们介绍发电厂工作情况的时候，关于变电器、高压瓶、三相倒闸、短路、捏线等名词和术语运用得颇为确当。他说：“农业是我们主要任务，但只有懂得了工业，才能使工业更好地为农业服务。”
    更美好的前景
    在临别前的一个晚上，在和马保山的闲扯中，意外地获得了一些材料，当我们扯到祖国未来的农村时，马保山兴奋起来了，他从炕上跳下来，叙述着社里发展工业的前景，他说：“最近中共定县县委提出一年到四年内全县实现‘九化’、
  ‘四网’（注）。党的号召，咱们应该提前实现。”他扳着指头告诉我们现在实现了水利灌溉电气化、机械化，建立了电话网、广播网；不久可实现农产品加工机械化，明年实现肥料化学化，运输车辆胶轮化等等。他越说越高兴，越说越兴奋。老话说：“‘人上碾子驴上磨’（形容活重），以前咱社妇女，白天推了一天水车，晚上还得推碾，做饭，现在可要解放了。”“将来社里再培养几个小青年，买几把推子，让小伙子们都留起分头，那该多漂亮！”“可是将来的庄稼长得怎样呢？”我们插问了一句。马保山很幽默地背了两句最近在社里流行的童谣作为回答：“一个山药装一筐，一颗玉米窜破房”。
    注：“九化”是：灌溉自流化，机械化，电气化，农产品加工机械化，肥料化学化，运输车辆胶轮化，耕作机械化，收割机械化，全县电气化；“四网”是：电话网，广播网，交通运输网，电话会议网。（附图片）
