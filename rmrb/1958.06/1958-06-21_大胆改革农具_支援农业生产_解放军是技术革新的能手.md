Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: Many officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have created many new types of agricultural tools in support of agricultural production. Many officers in the conscription departments of Zhejiang Province are known as "experts" in improving agricultural tools. Officers of the Yongjia County Conscription Bureau created the "bulldozer pulley brake" and "high-wheel wooden cart" during the construction of the Baodi Reservoir. Wang Jing-san, an assistant in a certain unit of the Jiaxing garrison, created three types of close-planting devices and a close-planting inspection ruler. These creations not only improved labor efficiency but also inspired farmers to dare to think and study, promoting the innovation of agricultural technology. Some officers have also applied the principles of military science and technology to the improvement of agricultural tools. Zhao Kun, deputy political commissar of the Taibai District Conscription Bureau in Baoji County, Shaanxi Province, used the principle of rifle shooting to create a "horizontal measuring instrument," providing a simple and accurate measuring tool for building water conservancy projects and excavating canals in mountainous areas.

Wholeheartedly supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and boldly reforming agricultural tools has become a spare-time creative activity for many officers. The "foot-operated liberation-style waterwheel" model exhibited at the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition was created by Wen Zhenbo, an accountant of a certain air force unit, in his spare time. This type of waterwheel is twice as efficient as the dragon-bone waterwheel.

In addition to completing their own work tasks, officers and workers in the automobile repair shops of various units are stepping up research and trial production of small agricultural machinery. Automobile repair shops in Lanzhou, Jinan, Kunming, and other five cities can now modify and manufacture tractors.

    大胆改革农具　支援农业生产
    解放军是技术革新的能手
    据新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军许多军官在支援农业生产中创造出许多新式农具。浙江省兵役部门的许多军官，被称为改良农具的“能手”。永嘉县兵役局军官，在修建宝第水库时，创造了“推土滑轮刹车”和“高轮木车”。嘉兴驻军某部助理员王敬三创造了三种密植器和一种密植检查尺。这些创造不仅提高了劳动效率，而且启发了农民敢想敢钻研，推动了农业技术的革新。有些军官还把军事科学技术的原理运用到农具改良中。陕西省宝鸡县太白区兵役局副政委赵琨，运用了步枪射击原理，创造出“水平测量具”，使山区兴修水利，开凿渠道有了简便、准确的测量工具。
    全力支援农业大跃进和大胆改革农具，成了许多军官的业余创造活动。全国农具展览会上展出的“脚踏解放式水车”模型，就是空军某部会计文镇波利用休息时间创造的。这种水车比龙骨水车效率高一倍。
    各部队汽车修理厂的军官和工人，在完成本身工作任务以外，都在加紧研究、试制小型农业机械。兰州、济南、昆明等五个汽车修理厂，现在已都能改装和制造拖拉机。
