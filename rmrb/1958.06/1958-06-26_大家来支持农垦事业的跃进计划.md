Everyone Should Support the Great Leap Forward Plan for State Farms
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the State Farms of the Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau of Mishan, Heilongjiang, have proposed a Great Leap Forward plan to expand the reclamation of more than 20 million mu of wasteland within the last four years of the Second Five-Year Plan, relying on the funds accumulated by the state farms themselves. To realize this plan, they will sell grain, soybeans, cotton, meat, cheese, and other products to the state, and contract for the expenses required for wasteland reclamation, construction, and production with the income from the sale of agricultural and livestock products, processing, transportation, mining, etc., without requiring additional investment from the state. This is a major event in China's state farm undertaking and a Great Leap Forward for state farms. After the realization of this plan, the Gobi Desert on both sides of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang and the swamps in the eastern part of Heilongjiang Province will be transformed into fertile fields, producing a large amount of living materials, industrial raw materials, and export goods for the country. The industrial and agricultural production and construction of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province will leap forward even faster; at the same time, it will greatly encourage the enthusiasm and initiative of the Chinese people to reclaim the 1.5 billion mu of wasteland in the border areas and inland. Therefore, everyone should actively support this Great Leap Forward plan for land reclamation.

The troops stationed in Xinjiang of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were the first to respond to Chairman Mao's call for the army to participate in production, working hard, reclaiming wasteland, and establishing state-owned farms under the system of ownership by the whole people. Officers and soldiers together, with hoes in their hands and rifles on their shoulders, braved the wind and dew, and worked selflessly. In the beginning, they lived in dugouts because they had no houses to live in; they ate rice with salt water because they had no vegetables to eat; they saved every penny to buy hoes and tractors because they had no funds for production and construction. They launched a large-scale movement to reclaim wasteland and build water conservancy projects in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The Mishan Reclamation Area in Heilongjiang took demobilized and transferred officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps as the vanguard to carry out wasteland reclamation, construction, and production. Like the officers and soldiers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, they reclaimed wasteland on a large scale in the harsh environment and low-lying swamps, and established state-owned farms under the socialist system of ownership by the whole people.

Experience has proven that in wasteland reclamation, construction, and production, it is necessary to implement the Party's mass line working method and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. We cannot passively wait for the conditions of technical forces, machinery, and funds to be met before reclaiming wasteland and building farms, but we must give full play to our subjective initiative to create conditions. The method of wasteland reclamation and construction should not be carried out in accordance with the dogmatic so-called "standardized" regulations, but should adopt the creative method of "reclaiming wasteland, producing, building, accumulating, and expanding simultaneously." For example, Xinjiang is an arid desert area, and the land reclamation teams built reservoirs, dug canals, and introduced snow water to the Gobi Desert; Mishan is a low-lying swamp area, and the land reclamation teams dug ditches and canals in the waterlogged swamp land, so that the accumulated water was drained and then re-collected to irrigate the crops, turning water damage into water conservancy. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps also adopted the Soviet Union's excellent cotton seeds, and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of cotton in the Manas new cotton area north of the Tianshan Mountains, the northernmost latitude in China. In 1952 and 1953, 20,000 mu of cotton were planted in this newly reclaimed cotton area, with an average yield of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, creating an unprecedented record of large-scale bumper harvest of cotton. The Mishan Reclamation Area also reclaimed nearly 2 million mu of wasteland in swamps in 1957, and also achieved a bumper harvest.

Transportation is inconvenient in the wasteland, and there are difficulties in the supply of production materials and living materials and the external transportation of farm products. Therefore, they built their own transportation network and construction engineering teams, and established agricultural product processing industries such as cotton, grain, and oil. During the busy farming season, the officers and soldiers engaged in transportation, construction engineering, and processing of sideline industries all went to work in the fields; during the slack farming season, the officers and soldiers engaged in agricultural production came to engage in construction, transportation, and water conservancy construction. Their policy and practice are to simultaneously carry out agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and processing, transportation, mining, construction, and other diversified operations. In this way, they can support each other, resist natural disasters, promote each other, accelerate the development of production, improve the utilization rate of land, equipment, labor, and animal power, overcome waste, continuously reduce investment in wasteland reclamation and construction and production costs, and accumulate funds faster.

This kind of cooperation system is not only used within the reclamation area, but also extends to the outside. For example, in order to support the development of the Karamay oil field in Xinjiang, the state-owned farms once sent people to repair roads. When the oil mine workers lacked grain and vegetables, the state-owned farms supplied them with grain and vegetables. The task of forest logging and afforestation and the construction of forest railways in the Wanda Mountains of Heilongjiang was also undertaken by state-owned farms. This kind of cooperation vigorously supported the development of local industry and transportation, and also increased their own income. The state-owned farms used these incomes to speed up the pace of wasteland reclamation and construction and the development of production.

From 1955 to this year, the average investment per mu by the Mishan Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau of Heilongjiang Province was less than 20 yuan. In 1958, the state's investment in this reclamation bureau was 60 million yuan; because the wasteland reclamation target was increased from 3 million mu to 6 million mu, the average investment per mu was reduced to more than 10 yuan, and some processing sideline industries and animal husbandry have already been started. In 1959, the cultivated area of this reclamation bureau can reach 9 million mu, and the income from agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline industries alone will be 120 million to 150 million yuan, in addition to other sideline income of 40 to 50 million yuan. Therefore, the expenses for continued wasteland reclamation in the next few years can be solved by relying on the accumulation of the enterprise itself, without requiring investment from the state.

The situation of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is similar. The original wasteland reclamation target here was 2 million mu, and now the target has been increased to 4.5 million to 5 million mu, and the investment per mu has also been reduced from the past average of more than 100 yuan to the current 20 yuan. By adopting the aforementioned methods, it can also be achieved in the next four years without requiring investment from the state.

What Xinjiang and Mishan can do, other reclamation areas should also be able to do. If they cannot do it at present, they should create conditions and strive to do it within the next one or two years or a little longer. At present, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hebei, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces have adopted the form of contracting for wasteland reclamation and production, and the average investment per mu is generally around 20 yuan (the investment in long-term crops such as rubber is higher, but it is also reduced by about 70% compared with the past). Doing so is completely in line with the spirit of the General Line of building socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

In the past few years, the development of state-owned farms has been slow and the reclamation of wasteland has been less, which is not a problem of conditions, but a problem of ideology. Some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the superiority of the socialist system of ownership by the whole people, and look at new things with the old eyes of the small-scale peasant economy. They are helpless in the face of large areas of wasteland, and think that they have neither the strength to reclaim it, nor the prospect of reclaiming it. Right-wing elements stirred up trouble and tried their best to obstruct it. Now the facts have proved that under the management of state-owned farms under the system of ownership by the whole people, large-scale reclamation of wasteland is both powerful and promising. These large tracts of ancient wasteland that have been uninhabited for thousands or tens of thousands of years will be completely turned over in the hands of our generation, producing a large amount of grain, cotton, oil, meat, milk, rubber, coffee, tea, white sugar, spices, ginseng, deer antler, vegetables, fruits, and other products for the country. People will see that the terrible wilderness in history has become a place with crisscrossing canals, shady green trees, granaries full of grain and cotton, herds of cattle and sheep, factories and power stations, schools and hospitals standing in great numbers, and highways and railways extending in all directions. These places will become the most lovable and beautiful people's paradise in the motherland.

    大家来支持农垦事业的跃进计划
    本报评论员
    新疆生产建设兵团和黑龙江密山铁道兵农垦局的国营农场，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，提出在第二个五年计划的后四年内，依靠国营农场本身积累的资金扩大开荒二千多万亩的跃进计划。为实现这个计划，他们向国家出售粮食、大豆、棉花、肉类、乳酪等产品，用出售农畜产品和加工、运输、采矿等收入，包干开荒建场和生产所需的费用，不要国家另外投资。这是我国农垦事业中的一件大事，是农垦事业的跃进。这个计划实现以后，新疆天山南北的戈壁滩和黑龙江省东部的沼泽地将变为良田，为国家生产大量生活资料、工业原料和出口物资；新疆维吾尔自治区和黑龙江省工农业生产建设将更快地跃进；同时也将大大鼓舞我国人民开垦边疆和内地的十五亿亩荒地的热情和积极性。因此，大家都应该积极支持这个农垦的跃进计划。
    中国人民解放军驻新疆的部队，曾经首先响应毛主席关于军队参加生产的号召，艰苦奋斗，开垦荒地，建立全民所有制的国营农场。他们官兵一起，手拿镢头，肩负步枪，餐风饮露，忘我劳动。当初他们没有房子住，就住地窝子；没有菜蔬吃，就用盐水就饭；没有生产建设资金，就节衣缩食，把节省下来的钱购买锄头和拖拉机。他们在天山南北展开了大规模的开垦荒地、兴修水利的运动。黑龙江的密山垦区是以铁道兵复员转业官兵为先锋进行开荒建场和生产工作的。他们和新疆生产建设兵团的官兵一样，在艰苦奋斗的环境中、在低洼的沼泽地上大规模地开垦荒地，建立了社会主义全民所有制的国营农场。
    经验证明，在开荒建场和生产中，必须贯彻执行党的群众路线的工作方法，高度发挥群众的积极性和创造性。不能消极地等待技术力量、机具、资金等条件具备以后才开荒建场，而要充分发挥主观能动性来创造条件。开荒建场的方法，也不能按教条主义的所谓“正规化”的规定办事，而要采取“边开荒、边生产、边建设、边积累、边扩大”的创造性的建场方法。比如，新疆是干旱沙漠地区，农垦队在那里修水库、挖渠道、把雪水引进戈壁滩上；密山是低洼沼泽地区，垦荒队在积水沼泽地上开沟引渠，使积水排而复聚，再来灌溉庄稼，变水害为水利。新疆生产兵团还采用了苏联优良棉种，在我国纬度最北的天山以北玛纳斯新棉区获得棉花大面积丰产。1952年和1953年在这个新垦的棉区上栽培二万亩棉花，每亩平均产籽棉四百斤，创造了棉花大面积丰产的空前纪录。密山垦区1957年在沼泽荒地上垦荒近二百万亩，也获得了丰产。
    荒原上交通不便，生产资料和生活资料的供应和农场产品的外运有困难，他们就自己动手来建立运输网和建筑工程队，创办了棉花、粮食、油料等农产品加工业。农忙时，从事运输、建筑工程和加工副业的官兵都到田间工作；农闲时，从事农业生产的官兵就来搞建筑、运输和修水利等工作。他们的方针和做法，是农林牧业和加工，运输，开矿，建筑等多种经营同时并举。这样就能够互相支援，抵御自然灾害，互相促进，加速生产的发展，提高土地、设备、人力、畜力的利用率，克服浪费现象，不断地降低开荒建场投资和生产成本，并且更快地积累资金。
    这种协作制不仅用于垦区内部，还发展到外部。例如，为了支援新疆克拉玛依油田的开发，国营农场曾经派人去修公路。油矿职工缺少粮食和蔬菜，国营农场就以粮食、蔬菜来供应。黑龙江完达山中森林采伐抚育与森林铁路的修建任务，也是由国营农场承担的。这种协作有力地支援了当地工业、交通运输业的发展，也增加了自己的收入。国营农场就用这些收入来加快开荒建场和发展生产的速度。
    黑龙江省密山铁道兵农垦局从1955年到今年，每亩平均投资还不到二十元。1958年国家对这个农垦局的投资是六千万元；由于开荒指标由三百万亩提高到六百万亩，每亩平均投资又降到了十多元，而且已经搞起了一些加工副业和畜牧业。这个农垦局1959年耕地面积可以达到九百万亩，光农牧副业的收入就有一亿二千万元到一亿五千万元，另外还可以有其他副业收入四、五千万元。因此，今后几年继续开荒的用费，依靠企业本身的积累就可以解决，而不再要国家投资了。
    新疆生产建设兵团的情形也差不多。这里原定开荒指标二百万亩，现在指标提高到四百五十万亩到五百万亩，每亩投资也从过去的平均一百多元降到现在的二十多元。采用前述各种办法，在今后四年内也可以作到不再要国家投资。
    新疆和密山能够做到的，别的垦区应该也能够做到，目前做不到的，应该创造条件，争取在今后一、二年内或更多一点的时间内做到。现在广东、广西、云南、湖北、湖南、江西、河北、甘肃、青海等省都采取开荒生产大包干形式，一般每亩投资都在二十元左右（长期作物如橡胶等的投资要高一些，但也比过去降低70％左右）。这样做，是完全符合于多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线精神的。
    过去几年国营农场发展较慢、开荒较少，并不是什么条件问题，而是思想问题。有些人对社会主义全民所有制的优越性认识不足，以小农经济的旧眼光来看新事物，在大片荒地面前束手无策，认为既没有力量开垦，开垦也没有前途。右派分子更兴风作浪，极力阻挠。现在事实已经证明，在全民所有制的国营农场经营之下，大量开荒是既有力量、也有前途的。这些沉睡了几千年几万年的荒无人烟的大片古生荒地，将在我们这一代人的手里彻底翻身，为国家生产大量粮食、棉花、油料、肉类、牛奶、橡胶、咖啡、茶叶、白糖、香料、人参、鹿茸、蔬菜、水果等产品。人们将看到历史上那么可怕的荒野变成水渠纵横，绿树成荫，粮棉满仓，牛羊成群，工厂和电站、学校、医院林立，公路铁路四通八达。这些地方将成为祖国最可爱最美丽的人民乐园。
