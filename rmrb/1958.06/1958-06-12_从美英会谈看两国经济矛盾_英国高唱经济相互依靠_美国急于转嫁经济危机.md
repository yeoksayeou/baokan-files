    The talks currently being held in Washington between British Prime Minister Macmillan and US President Eisenhower show that, when they discuss specific issues, the contradictions between the two countries greatly overshadow their publicly expressed common desire to find a way out of the West's political passivity and economic recession.

    In several public speeches after arriving in the United States, Macmillan emphasized the current critical and difficult economic situation facing Western countries, and repeatedly put forward his theory of "economic interdependence," hoping to obtain US assistance to support the British and Sterling Zone economies.

    Coordinating with Macmillan's appeal, economists and bourgeois newspapers here have expressed opinions emphasizing that to save the capitalist world, the United Kingdom must be saved first. First of all, the Sterling Area must be supported.

    British government officials have also repeatedly emphasized that the position of the pound sterling is unstable. According to official announcements, the gold and dollar reserves of this region last month were $3,003.9 million, which accounts for only about 5% of the reserves of the capitalist world. Of this, $811 million was borrowed from the International Monetary Fund and the US Export-Import Bank. The weak foundation of the pound sterling is easily subject to sudden fluctuations, and the danger of using reserves still exists.

    According to the British financial capital mouthpiece, "The Economist" magazine, Britain hopes to strengthen its economic position through "Dollar-Sterling Cooperation," which is: The United States guarantees the Sterling system, expands the financial resources of the International Monetary Fund by absorbing more dollars, turns the organization into a super central bank so that it can share the burden of providing funds for Western world trade with the pound sterling, and raises the dollar price of gold, thereby increasing the value of the pound sterling.

    So far, the US response to Britain's approach has been lukewarm. The United States is busy dealing with its own economic crisis. It is said that the United States favors providing Marshall Plan-style "aid" to "underdeveloped" countries, so that on the one hand it can export its own economic crisis, and on the other hand, it can use this to infiltrate areas dominated by British influence.

    Judging from newspaper comments, Britain's reaction to this point is very cautious and apprehensive.

    "The Economist" stated that the US plan would not be an effective way to solve the main problems.

    从美英会谈看两国经济矛盾
    英国高唱经济相互依靠  美国急于转嫁经济危机

    英国首相麦克米伦和美国总统艾森豪威尔目前在华盛顿举行的会谈表明，当他们讨论具体问题的时候，两国之间的矛盾使他们公开表示的希望设法摆脱西方的政治被动和经济萧条的共同愿望大大相形失色。
    麦克米伦在到达美国后在几次公开演说中，都强调指出目前西方国家在经济方面面临的危急和困难局面，并且一再提出他的“经济相互依靠”的理论，希望能够得到美国的援助来支持英国和英镑区的经济。
    和麦克米伦的这种呼吁相配合，这里的经济学家和资产阶级报纸发表意见强调指出，要拯救资本主义世界，必须先拯救联合王国。首先，必须支持英镑地区。
    英国政府人士也一再强调，英镑的地位是不稳定的。据官方宣布，这个地区的黄金和美元储备上个月是三十亿零三千九百万美元，这只占资本主义世界储备的5％左右。其中，八亿一千一百万美元是向国际货币基金组织和美国进出口银行借的。基础薄弱的英镑很容易遭到突然的波动，动用储备的危险仍旧存在。
    据英国金融资本喉舌“经济学家”杂志说，英国希望通过“美元—英镑合作”来加强它的经济地位，这就是：由美国对英镑体系加以保证，扩大国际货币基金组织的财源，办法是吸收更多的美元，把这个组织变成一个超级中央银行，使它可以分担英镑对西方世界贸易提供资金的负担，并且提高黄金的美元价格，从而提高英镑的价值。
    迄今为止，美国对英国的这个办法的反应是冷淡的。美国正忙于对付它自己的经济危机，据说，美国赞成对“不发达”国家提供马歇尔计划式的“援助”，这样一方面可以输出它自己的经济危机，另一方面可以借此渗入在英国势力支配下的地区。
    从报纸评论来看，英国对这一点的反应是非常谨慎的和疑惧的。
    “经济学家”表示，美国的这一计划不会是解决主要问题的有效办法。
