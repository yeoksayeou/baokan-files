Two-Wheel Two-Share Plows Have New Uses Again
Retrofitted Deep Plows are More Effective Than Double-Layer Two-Share Plows
(Our dispatch) The Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, successfully retrofitted a light two-wheel two-share plow into a "two-wheel double-layer two-share deep plow." This was designed by Comrade Zhang Xinyuan, a technician from the Pingyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, with assistance from the Pingyuan County Chengguan Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing and Repair Plant. The results of a test on the afternoon of June 9th in the east of Pingyuan County: pulled by two oxen, the plowing depth was eight *shi cun* (approximately 10.5 inches); pulled by three oxen, the plowing depth was one *shi chi* (approximately 14 inches). It can plow six *mu* (approximately 0.99 acres) per day.

A comparative experiment between the double-layer two-share plow created in Changge County, Henan, and the "two-wheel double-layer two-share deep plow" of Pingyuan County: using two oxen in both cases, the double-layer two-share plow plowed to a depth of less than seven *shi cun* (approximately 9.2 inches), and the turned soil sometimes had large clods; the "two-wheel double-layer two-share deep plow" plowed to a depth of eight *shi cun* (approximately 10.5 inches), turning the soil evenly and smoothly. Because the plowshare of the two-wheel double-layer two-share deep plow is wider than the double-layer two-share plow, it plows a wider area. The two-wheel double-layer two-share deep plow has a depth adjustment device, which can adjust the depth at any time. The operating technique of the two-wheel double-layer two-share deep plow is easier to master than the double-layer two-share plow, and the retrofitting technology is also simpler. If deep plowing is not required, it can also be retrofitted back to the original light two-wheel two-share plow.

    双轮双铧犁又有新用途
    改装深耕犁效能比双层双铧犁更好
    本报讯　山东省平原县用轻型双轮双铧犁改装为“双轮双层双铧深耕犁”成功。这是由平原县供销社技术员张新元同志设计，平原县城关农业机械制造修配厂帮助改装的。6月9日下午在平原县城东试验结果：用二头黄牛拉，耕深八市寸；用三头耕牛拉，耕深一市尺。每天可耕六亩。
    河南长葛县创造的双层双铧犁与平原县的“双轮双层双铧深耕犁”的耕地对比试验结果：都用二头牛，双层双铧犁耕深不到七市寸，翻过的土有时有大坷垃，“双轮双层双铧深耕犁”耕深八市寸，翻土均匀、平整；因双轮双层双铧深耕犁的犁铧比双层双铧犁宽，所以它就耕的宽；双轮双层双铧深耕犁有耕深调节器设备，能随时调节深浅；双轮双层双铧深耕犁的操作技术比双层双铧犁好掌握，改装技术也较简单，如不需要深耕时，还可以改装为原来的轻型双轮双铧犁。
