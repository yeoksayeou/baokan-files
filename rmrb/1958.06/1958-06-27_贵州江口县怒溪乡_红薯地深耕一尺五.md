    Nuxi Township, Jiangkou County, Guizhou
    Sweet Potato Fields Deeply Plowed to One and a Half Feet
    (From our newspaper) According to the Guizhou Daily: Nuxi Township, Jiangkou County, Guizhou Province, is carrying out a movement to deeply plow the land to a depth of one and a half feet. In the first ten days of June, the township deeply plowed more than 1,200 mu of sweet potato fields, all meeting the requirement of "deeply plowing the land to one and a half feet." This is a new and important measure taken by Nuxi Township to increase its grain production target—from the original 1,300 jin per mu to 1,500 jin per mu.
    Initially, a few agricultural cooperative cadres and members were afraid that deeply plowing the land to one and a half feet was "impossible," but most people believed that today we must break through past superstitions, dare to think and dare to act, and do things that our predecessors had not done. Everyone listed sufficient facts to reverse the fear of difficulties in deeply plowing to one and a half feet. Some cited the fact that Kuai Chang Cooperative intercropped corn and potatoes in sweet potato soil that had been deeply plowed to one and a half feet and achieved high yields, to illustrate the huge role of deep plowing; some cooperatives summarized the fact that old farmers in the past deeply plowed to one and a half feet when planting indigo, refuting the idea that they could only deeply plow eight inches. Everyone believed that vigorously carrying out agricultural tool reforms could solve the problem of deeply plowing to one and a half feet.
    Under the current conditions, how to carry out deep plowing? The main method discussed by the farmers in this township is to use new-style agricultural tools for "combined plowing": the first time, use a single-铧 plow without wheels to plow eight inches, turning the soil to the left, and then plow it again, turning the soil to the right. By adopting this "combined plowing" method, two people with two oxen can deeply plow one and a half mu a day. For the very small number of sandy bottom lands and sloping lands that are not easy to use new-style agricultural tools, manual digging can be used, and it can still completely reach a depth of one and a half feet, with a maximum of only seven workdays per mu. After discussion, the entire township immediately formulated a specific plan: before the beginning of July, all the existing 4,000 mu of sweet potato fields will be deeply plowed to one and a half feet; the remaining 11,000 mu of fields that have been planted with crops will be deeply plowed after autumn.

### 贵州江口县怒溪乡  红薯地深耕一尺五

    贵州江口县怒溪乡
    红薯地深耕一尺五
    本报讯　据贵州日报消息：贵州省江口县怒溪乡正在开展一个深翻土地一尺五的运动。6月上旬的十天中，全乡深犁红薯地一千二百多亩，并全部达到了“深翻土地一尺五”的要求。这是怒溪乡提高粮食增产指标——由原每亩产粮一千三百斤改为一千五百斤的一项新的重要措施。
    开始，有少数农业社的干部和社员怕深翻土地一尺五“办不到”，但是大多数人认为，今天要冲破过去的迷信思想，敢想敢做，干出前人没有干过的事情。大家列举了充分的事实扭转了对深耕一尺五的畏难情绪。有的举出快场社在深耕一尺五的红薯土里套种包谷、洋芋获得高额增产的事实，来说明深耕的巨大作用；有的社总结了过去老农民中种蓝靛深耕一尺五的事实，驳斥了那种只能深耕八寸的思想。大家认为大搞农具改革，就能够解决深耕一尺五的问题。
    在目前条件下，怎样进行深耕呢？这个乡的农民讨论出来的主要的办法是用新式农具进行“套犁”：第一次用无轮一铧犁翻犁八寸，把土顺向左边，然后再犁一次，把土顺向右边，采取这种“套犁”的办法，一天两头牛、两个人可以深耕一亩半。对于极少部分的不便于使用新式农具的沙底地和坡土，可以用人工突击挖，仍然完全能够达到一尺五寸深，一亩地最多只需七个工。经过讨论，全乡立即订出了具体计划：在7月初以前，将现有的四千亩红薯地全部深耕一尺五寸；其余已种上庄稼的一万一千亩田土，在秋后进行深耕。
