　　Resolutely Believe in the Masses
　　Zhang Bingwei
    The Party rectification and commune rectification in Xixian County, Henan Province, have achieved very remarkable results. The experience of Xixian County can be summarized in one sentence: resolutely believe in the masses, boldly mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses to carry out rectification.

    The mass line working method is the fundamental method for our Party to carry out all its work. Under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, cadres at all levels have always worked according to the principles of the mass line. However, it must also be admitted that, among a considerable number of cadres, the mass line is not fully implemented because dogmatism and empiricism have not been eradicated. Many comrades are not good at creatively applying the mass line according to new situations and new needs. Now, our country is in a period of rapid development, and all socialist construction undertakings are making great leaps forward. The Great Leap Forward requires large-scale working methods. The old methods of working with small steps and bound feet are outdated and no longer applicable. The comrades in Xixian County are good at changing their leadership methods and working methods in a timely manner according to the new situation and new needs. They have unhesitatingly abandoned the old set of Party rectification and commune rectification methods of slowly spending one or two months in a small village, first within the Party and then outside the Party, first cadres and then the masses, from top to bottom, and then from bottom to top. They adopted large-scale working methods such as directly meeting with the masses, boldly mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, debate extensively, use big-character posters, and hold exhibitions. This method is very effective. In a very short period of time, all three types of communes in the county were elevated to first-class and second-class communes; the Party and League organizations were made purer and their combat effectiveness was enhanced; many long-standing problems in the work were resolved; the relationship between people was changed, and the connection between cadres and the masses was strengthened; the patriotism and socialist consciousness of the masses were greatly enhanced. In short, the entire county's work took on a new look, and the county's work entered a new period.

    The widespread use of big-character posters in rural areas is a very important sign that leading cadres firmly believe in the masses and boldly mobilize them to carry out rectification movements. Some people once believed that big-character posters are only suitable for government agencies, enterprises, and universities, and not for rural areas. The reason is that farmers have low levels of education and will not be able to use big-character posters as a new weapon; forcing them to do so will become a mere formality; rural areas are too scattered and difficult to control, and it is easy to make mistakes, and so on. What does this illustrate? It shows that some people simply do not believe in the masses, so they dare not boldly mobilize the masses and rely on them to carry out rectification. The comrades in Xixian County understand the principle of "the masses liberate themselves," and they firmly believe in the masses. They believed correctly. The liberated Chinese peasants not only know how to use big-character posters as a new weapon, but they also use it very well. Not only did they not make any mistakes, but they also achieved extraordinary results, both improving the work and educating themselves. After seeing the facts in Xixian County, those who do not believe in the masses' awareness, do not believe that farmers can use big-character posters, and therefore are unwilling and dare not boldly mobilize the masses to carry out rectification, and are unwilling and dare not boldly hand over the new weapon of big-character posters to the broad masses of farmers, should wake up.

    "Cadres rectifying errors at the door" is an important reason for the major achievements of the rectification movement in Xixian County. For any opinions raised by the masses in the great airing of views and the use of big-character posters that pertain to the cadres' own shortcomings and mistakes, the cadres personally went to the homes of those who raised the opinions, admitted their mistakes face to face, made self-criticisms, and immediately corrected them. This practice greatly moved the masses, greatly increased the masses' trust in the leadership of the Party, fundamentally improved the relationship between cadres and the masses; it also profoundly educated the masses, inspiring and promoting the masses to consciously rise up to overcome their shortcomings and improve their work. As the Central Committee of the Party pointed out in its report to the Eighth National Congress, Second Session: "The masses intimately feel that the Party has handed its heart over to them, and they have also handed their hearts over to the Party."

    Big-character posters are a very good way to promote socialist democracy, and "cadres rectifying errors at the door" is a new development of the mass line. The combined use of big-character posters and rectifying errors at the door powerfully promotes the rectification movement towards complete victory and promotes socialist construction to a new upsurge. This has already been proven in Xixian County, and with the dissemination and promotion of the Xixian County experience, it will certainly be proven throughout the country.

　　坚决地相信群众
　　张丙蔚
    河南息县整党、整社取得了十分显著的效果。息县的经验概括成一句话就是：坚决地相信群众，大胆放手地发动群众、依靠群众进行整改。
    群众路线的工作方法，是我党进行一切工作中的根本方法。在党和毛主席的教导下，各级干部从来就是根据群众路线的原则进行工作的。但是也应该承认，在相当一部分干部中，由于教条主义和经验主义还没有根除，群众路线执行得并不充分，不少同志还不善于根据新的情况和新的需要，创造性地运用群众路线。现在，我们的国家正处在向前飞跃发展的时期中，各项社会主义建设事业都在大跃进。大跃进需要大规模的工作方法。那种小手小脚的工作方法已经过时了，不适用了。息县的同志善于根据新的情况和新的需要，及时地改变自己的领导方法和工作方法，他们毫不犹豫地抛弃了过去那种慢腾腾地用一两个月时间在一个小村里先党内后党外，先干部后群众，从上而下，然后再从下而上的老一套的整党、整社办法，采取了直接同群众见面，大胆放手地发动群众大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报和展览会等大规模的工作方法。这方法十分有效，在极短的时间内，便使全县的三类社都上升到一类社和二类社；使党和团的组织更加纯洁，战斗力更加提高；解决了很多工作中长期不能解决的问题；改变了人和人的关系，密切了干部和群众的联系；使群众的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟大大提高，总之，使全县的工作面貌为之一新，使全县的工作进入到了一个新的时期。
    在农村也广泛地运用大字报，是领导干部坚决相信群众，大胆放手发动群众进行整改运动的一个很重要的标志。曾经有人认为：大字报只适用于机关、企业和高等学校，而不适用于农村。理由是农民文化低，不会运用大字报这个新式武器，勉强搞也会流于形式；农村太分散，不好掌握，容易出偏差等等。这说明什么问题呢？它说明有一些人根本不相信群众，所以也就不敢大胆放手地发动群众并依靠群众进行整改。息县的同志懂得“群众自己解放自己”的道理，他们坚决相信群众。他们信对了。解放了的中国农民不仅会使用大字报这个新式武器，而且使用得非常好。不仅没有出什么偏差，反而获得了非常的功效，既改进了工作，也教育了自己。看过息县的事实以后，那些不相信群众的觉悟，不相信农民会使用大字报，从而不肯和不敢放手发动群众进行整改，不肯和不敢大胆把大字报这个新式武器交给广大农民的人，应该猛醒了。
    “干部登门整改”是息县整改运动中取得重大成果的一个重要原因。群众在大鸣大放、大字报中提出的意见，凡是属于干部自己的缺点和错误，干部就亲自到提意见的人家里，当面承认错误，进行检讨，并马上改正。这种作法，使群众极为感动，极大地提高了群众对党的领导的信任，从根本上改善了干部和群众的关系；同时也深刻的教育了群众，启发和推动了群众自觉的起来克服自己的缺点，改进自己的工作。正如党中央向八大二次会议的工作报告中所指出的：“群众亲切地感觉到党把心交给了他们，他们也把心交给了党。”
    大字报是发扬社会主义民主的一个很好的方法，而“干部登门整改”则是群众路线的一个新的发展。大字报和登门整改结合运用，就强有力地推动着整改运动走向彻底胜利，推动着社会主义建设事业奔向新的高潮。这已经在息县得到证明了，随着息县经验的传播和推广，也必将在全国证明它。
