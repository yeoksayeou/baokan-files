Beijing National Defense Sports Association
Establishes Hydrogen Balloon Parachuting Training Class

    (Our Newspaper) News: The first amateur hydrogen balloon parachuting training class established by the Beijing National Defense Sports Association held its opening ceremony on June 22 at the auditorium of the China National Defense Sports Association.

    This is the first amateur hydrogen balloon parachuting training class in the capital, and also in the entire country. It marks a new development in China's parachuting cause. Attending this training class are 155 young men and women from more than sixty units, including Peking University, Beijing Experimental High School, Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, and Tongren Hospital. They are all parachuting instructors and outstanding parachutists between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two, who have jumped from parachute towers more than ten times. Each one is physically strong and full of energy. After learning and mastering the structure, folding, and use of parachutes, and studying the methods of hydrogen balloon parachuting, and practicing aerial parachuting movements on the ground platform, basket, and control frame, they will enter hydrogen balloon parachuting at the end of July.
