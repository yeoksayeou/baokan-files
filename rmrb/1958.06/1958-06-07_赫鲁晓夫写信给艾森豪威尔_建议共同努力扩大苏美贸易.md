Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 5th: Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower, stating that the Soviet government, with a sincere desire to improve Soviet-American relations, suggests that the U.S. government jointly take resolute measures to expand trade between the two countries. Khrushchev's letter was delivered to the U.S. State Department on the 3rd by the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Menshikov.

Khrushchev pointed out that there is a great possibility of solving the issue of methods to improve and develop Soviet-American relations, and that it has not been well utilized up to now.

Khrushchev said that we should work together to resolve pressing common international issues through peaceful consultations. We believe that the summit meeting of national leaders proposed by the Soviet Union will help in this regard, and we should also devote ourselves to developing direct relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

The Soviet government believes that existing conditions make it possible for us to take important and far-reaching steps in developing trade relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, so that both countries can obtain great benefits and promote universal peace.

Khrushchev pointed out that there was a period when the economic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States developed extremely smoothly. However, in the past decade, trade between the two countries has not only failed to develop further, but has instead shrunk to a negligible level, and the responsibility for this does not lie with the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev specifically emphasized that the Soviet government's proposal to expand Soviet-American trade does not refer to military arms or equipment for military production. The Soviet Union is now implementing a new and grand plan to further increase the production of consumer goods. This plan only pursues peaceful goals, and its aim is to further improve the welfare of the people. The Soviet Union has all the conditions and resources to successfully implement the above plan. However, in order to accelerate the implementation of this plan, the Soviet government can purchase a large amount of relevant equipment and materials from the United States. In this way, the United States will also have the opportunity to increase the operating rate of its industrial enterprises and the employment rate of its residents.

Khrushchev then put forward specific suggestions from the Soviet government regarding cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States in the production of synthetic materials and their products, and pointed out that at the same time, the Soviet Union could propose to the United States a broad plan for ordering other equipment needed for the production of consumer goods and for housing and public utilities construction. The Soviet Union can also order a large number of industrial materials and manufactured products.

The Soviet government believes that, according to corresponding agreements between the two sides, it can purchase equipment and various materials worth tens of billions of dollars from the United States in the next few years. The Soviet Union can supply goods of Soviet origin that the United States is interested in as payment.

Khrushchev also stated that if American companies have certain difficulties in resuming large-scale purchases of Soviet goods in a short period of time, and at the same time American companies are now interested in accepting orders, the Soviet Union is prepared to purchase more American goods and sell less of its own goods in the initial years. He then pointed out that this raises the question of installment payments and long-term loans under normal conditions. Loans and installment payments will create conditions for the Soviet Union to order goods from the United States quickly and in greater quantities.

Khrushchev suggested that the issue of establishing the necessary contractual legal basis for arranging trade between the two countries, as well as the issue of realizing mutual purchase of goods and mutual settlement of accounts, can be agreed upon through consultations between the two governments.

Khrushchev said that the smooth development of Soviet-American trade will be a real contribution to the universal revitalization of international trade. All countries will benefit from this development, including the United States, which will enable the United States to obtain a large number of favorable orders not only from the Soviet Union, but also from many other countries. Khrushchev finally expressed his hope that the U.S. government would treat the suggestions put forward in this letter with due attention.

### 赫鲁晓夫写信给艾森豪威尔  建议共同努力扩大苏美贸易

　　赫鲁晓夫写信给艾森豪威尔
    建议共同努力扩大苏美贸易
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔说，苏联政府本着改善苏美两国关系的真诚愿望，建议美国政府共同采取坚决措施来扩大两国间的贸易。赫鲁晓夫的信已经在3日由苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫交给美国国务院。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，解决有关改善和发展苏美关系的方法问题的可能性是很大的，而且直到目前为止还没有很好加以利用。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们应当共同努力通过和平协商来解决迫切的共同的国际问题，我们相信苏联所建议的国家领导人的高级会议有助于此，同时也要致力于发展苏联同美国的直接关系。
    苏联政府认为，现有条件使我们有可能在发展苏美两国间的贸易关系方面采取重要的、远大的步骤，以使两国都获得巨大利益并促进普遍和平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，曾经有过一段时期，苏美双方的经济关系发展得极为顺利。但是最近十年来两国的贸易不但没有得到进一步的发展，相反已经缩减到微乎其微的水平，其责任不在苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫特别强调指出，苏联政府提出扩大苏美贸易的建议，决不是指军火或是供军事生产用的设备。苏联现在正在实现进一步提高消费品生产的新的宏伟计划。这个计划只是追求和平的目的，它以进一步提高居民的福利为目标。苏联有一切条件和资源来胜利执行上述计划。但是，苏联政府为了加速这个计划的实现，可以向美国大量采购有关的设备和材料。这样一来，美国也会有可能提高自己工业企业的开工率和居民的就业率。
    赫鲁晓夫接着提出了苏联政府关于苏美两国在生产合成材料及其制品方面的合作的具体建议，并且指出，同时苏联可以向美国提出订购生产消费品以及住房和公用事业建设所需要的其他设备的广泛计划，苏联还可以大量订购一系列工业物资和制成品。
    苏联政府认为，根据双方相应的协议，最近几年内可以向美国购置数十亿美元的装备和各种物资。苏联可以供给美国所感到兴趣的苏联商品来作为偿付。
    赫鲁晓夫还表示，如果美国公司在短时期内重新大规模购买苏联商品有一定的困难、同时美国公司对接受订货现在就感到兴趣的话，苏联准备在最初几年多购买美国的货物而少出售自己的货物。他接着指出，因此就产生了根据正常条件分期付款和提供长期贷款的问题。贷款和分期付款会创造条件使苏联向美国迅速地、更大量地订购商品。
    赫鲁晓夫建议，关于为安排两国贸易而建立必要的合同法律基础的问题，以及关于实现互相购买商品和双方的清账问题，可以由两国政府会商取得协议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，顺利发展苏美贸易在普遍活跃国际贸易方面将是一个真正的贡献。所有的国家都会从这种事态发展中得到好处，这同样也包括美国在内，这样就使美国不仅能从苏联、而且也能从许多其他国家获得大量有利的订货。赫鲁晓夫最后表示希望美国政府以应有的注意对待这封信中所提出的建议。
