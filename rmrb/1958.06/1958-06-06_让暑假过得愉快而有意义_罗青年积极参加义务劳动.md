Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 5th: More than 600,000 Romanian youths are actively participating in various voluntary labor activities under the slogan of beautifying cities, villages, and enterprises.

    Since mid-March this year, the youth have built 1,245 parks, 975 sports grounds, and 5,692 bridges, planted more than 2.3 million fruit trees, and repaired 743,000 square meters of roads.

    This year, many Romanian university, middle school, and primary school students will also spend a pleasant summer vacation in labor. At present, the academic year exams for primary schools across the country have ended. The Labor Youth League, trade unions, and the Ministry of Education and Culture are preparing to organize tens of thousands of primary school students to glean wheat during the wheat harvest and organize 15,000 primary school students to participate in two to three weeks of labor in collective farms.

    University and middle school students across the country are now both preparing for exams and actively signing up to participate in summer vacation labor. 65% of the students at the Cluj Medical Institute have already signed up. More than 2,740 university students from "Babeș-Bolyai University" have formed 59 production teams.

    让暑假过得愉快而有意义
    罗青年积极参加义务劳动
    新华社布加勒斯特5日电　罗马尼亚六十多万青年在美化城市、乡村、企业机关的口号下积极参加各种义务劳动。
    从今年3月中旬以来，青年们已经修建了一千二百四十五个公园、九百七十五个运动场、五千六百九十二座桥梁，种植果树二百三十多万株，修路七十四万三千多平方公尺。
    今年，许多罗马尼亚大学、中学和小学的学生还将在劳动中度过愉快的暑假生活。目前，全国小学的学年考试已经结束，劳动青年联盟、工会、教育和文化部等部门准备组织几万名小学生在麦收时拾麦穗，组织一万五千名小学生到集体农庄去参加二至三星期的劳动。
    全国大学和中学的学生们现在一方面紧张地准备考试，一方面在积极报名参加暑假劳动。克罗什城医学院的学生有65％已经报名。“巴别士大学”的两千七百四十多名大学生已组成了五十九个生产队。
