Everyone Asks Questions, Everyone Offers Ideas
·Editor·
In the agricultural tool reform movement, the Fujian Daily suggested some time ago using the method of "posing questions and writing articles" to organize the masses to create urgently needed new agricultural tools. Wang Maoyu, the director of the Aofeng Cooperative in Minhou County, posed a question, asking for the creation of a harvester. As of June 12th, thirteen responses have been received. Among them is a hand-pushed harvester created by the Luoyuan County Agricultural Tool Factory. It is easy to make and use. One person can harvest twenty mu of rice a day, increasing efficiency by nineteen times, while the cost is only thirty yuan (the raw materials are mainly wood, and the weight is less than one hundred catties). This harvester has now been sent to the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Tool Exhibition for the masses to evaluate and offer opinions, so as to continue to improve and enhance it.

This event tells people that when something has become an urgent requirement of the broad masses, the appearance of that thing is not far away. When a contradiction has become a prominent contradiction that urgently needs to be resolved, the objective possibility of resolving this contradiction also appears at the same time. At this time, the most important thing is to prepare and create the necessary conditions to transform possibility into reality.

After agricultural collectivization, the urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants is to develop agricultural production at a high speed, which requires the construction of many projects and undertakings. Both large-scale production and large-scale capital construction need to be carried out, which leads to the problem of insufficient labor. This is one of the contradictions that have emerged universally across the country since last winter. The main method of solving this contradiction is to reform production tools and improve labor productivity. In order to reform tools and create new tools, and also to solve other newly emerging contradictions and problems, the Fujian Daily suggested using the method of "posing questions and writing articles," which has already achieved results. Now Comrade Sun Jichang suggests that our newspaper also call on everyone to name specific topics, which is very good. The benefit of doing so is to bring the most urgent demands and the most concerning issues of the broad masses to the attention of the broad masses, to arouse the research and discussion of the broad masses, and to concentrate the wisdom and strength of the broad masses to solve these problems. This is a concrete application and development of the Party's mass line, and a fundamental way to resolve contradictions.

Due to the establishment of socialist public ownership, and due to the consistency of the broad masses in economic interests, the number of things that can arouse widespread common interest has greatly increased. Reforming tools and creating agricultural machinery is one of the focal points of the common interest of the broad masses of peasants. And because the peasants have been freed from the shackles of the disaster-ridden small-scale peasant economy, a very large number of people are able to participate in the movement of creation and reform. As for the working class, they are laborers who are even more creative and master modern production technology. As long as the questions are put to them, they will never shrink back. What about the scientific and technological community? After rectification and ideological remolding, they have also broken the bourgeois ideological tendency of not combining with practice and not combining with the masses. When the working people need them to contribute their knowledge and skills, they generally will not refuse.

These are the social foundations for the inevitable success of our launching the movement to name specific topics.

Dear readers: If you have any urgent demands, please submit your topics. You can directly name a certain industry, factory, or cooperative, or you can generally put forward your demands. We will publish these demands and ask the people of the whole country to study and answer your questions and meet your demands.

    人人发问　个个献策
    ·编者·
    在农具改革运动中，福建日报前些时建议用“出题目做文章”的办法组织群众创造当前迫切需要的新式农具。闵州鳌峰社社长王茂玉出了一个题目，要求创造收割机。截至本月12日，已经有十三处应征。其中有罗源县农具厂创制的一种手推收割机，易制易用，一天一人能割稻二十亩，工效提高十九倍，而造价只要三十元（原料主要是木材，重量不到百斤）。现在这部收割机已经送到福建省农具展览会，请群众鉴定，提出意见，以便继续改进，提高。
    这件事告诉人们：当某一事物已经成为广大群众的迫切要求的时候，这一事物的出现就为期不远了。当某一矛盾已经成为当前突出的迫切需要解决的矛盾的时候，解决这一矛盾的客观可能性就也同时出现了。这时候，最重要的事情就是准备和创造必要的条件，使可能性向着现实性转化。
    农业生产合作化以后，广大农民的迫切要求是高速度地发展农业生产，这就要兴办许许多多的工程和事业。又要搞大生产，又要搞大规模的基本建设，这就发生了劳动力不足的问题。这是去年冬季以来全国各地普遍出现的矛盾之一。解决这一矛盾的主要方法，是改革生产工具，提高劳动生产率。为了改革工具，创造新的工具，也为了解决其他新出现的矛盾和问题，福建日报建议采用“出题目做文章”的办法，已经收到效果。现在孙纪昌同志建议本报也来号召大家点名出题目，这是很好的。这样做的好处，就是把广大群众最迫切的要求和最关心的问题，提到广大群众的面前来，引起广大群众的研究和探讨，集中广大群众的智慧和力量来解决这些问题。这是党的群众路线的具体运用和发展，是解决矛盾的一个根本办法。
    由于社会主义公有制的建立，由于广大群众在经济利益上的一致，现在能够引起广泛的共同兴趣的事情大大地增多了。改革工具和创造农业机械，则是广大农民的共同兴趣的集中点之一。而由于农民都摆脱了充满灾难的小农经济的束缚，所以就有非常多的人能够来参加创造和改革的运动。至于工人群众，那是更富于创造精神的掌握着现代生产技术的劳动者。只要把题目出到了他们头上，他们是决不会退缩的。科学技术界呢？他们经过整风和思想改造，也打破了不与实际结合、不与群众结合的资产阶级思想倾向。在劳动人民需要他们贡献自己的学识和技能的时候，他们一般是不会拒绝的。
    这些，就是我们发动点名出题目运动必然能取得收获的社会基础。
    亲爱的读者：你们有什么迫切的要求，就来出题目吧。直接点某行业、某工厂、某合作社的名也可，一般地提出自己的要求也可。我们将发表这些要求，请全国人民来研究和回答你们的问题，满足你们的要求。
