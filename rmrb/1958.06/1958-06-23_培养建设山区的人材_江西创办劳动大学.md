To Cultivate Talents for Mountain Area Construction
Jiangxi Establishes Labor University

(Our dispatch) Jiangxi Province, breaking with convention, has decided to establish a "Communist Labor University." The general campus of the Jiangxi Province "Communist Labor University" is located in Xishan, in the western suburbs of Nanchang City, with a branch campus established at each of the twenty-four reclamation farms in Jinggang Mountain, Lushan Mountain, Damao Mountain, etc.

Since Jiangxi Province transferred more than 50,000 cadres last winter to develop and build mountainous areas, the Jiangxi Provincial Party and government leading organs and relevant departments have frequently received letters from young people all over the province and the country, requesting to participate in the development and construction work in the mountainous areas of Jiangxi. The establishment of the Communist Labor University in Jiangxi Province will fully meet this demand.

The general campus and branch campuses of the Jiangxi Province Communist Labor University will establish several departments such as agriculture, forestry, and industry, according to the specific circumstances.

Professors and teaching staff for the general campus will be resolved by the Provincial People's Committee, and each branch campus will be resolved by each reclamation farm, with any shortfall being supplemented by the respective prefectural administrative offices; in addition, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee will also organize mobile lecture groups to assist with teaching.

The Jiangxi Province Communist Labor University will begin enrolling students on July 1st throughout the province and the country. The study period at the Labor University is two to four years. Upon graduation, diplomas will be issued, and graduates will be assigned uniformly or allowed to find employment independently.

The general campus of the Communist Labor University recently convened the first liaison meeting of the principals and Party committee secretaries of various branch campuses. Governor Shao Shiping, Provincial Party Secretary Fang Zhichun, and Provincial Party Secretary and President of the general campus, Liu Junxiu, all attended the meeting and delivered reports. Shao Shiping, in his report, spoke of the purpose and task of establishing the Communist Labor University, which is to specifically implement the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and to cultivate talents in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and industry who possess a communist style, are both red and expert. Resolutely implement the educational policy of combining work and study, part-work and part-study, and theory with practice. There is a fundamental difference in the recruitment of students compared to bourgeois schools. The first requirement is good political conditions; the second is good labor performance; and the third is the level of education. In short, we must recruit as many children of workers and peasants as possible.

The principals and Party committee secretaries of the various branch campuses held heated discussions at the meeting, unanimously believing that the establishment of a Communist Labor University in the mountainous areas is a powerful guarantee for further developing the mountainous areas and promoting the economic and cultural prosperity of the mountainous areas. At the same time, they believe that there are many favorable conditions for running a university in the mountainous areas: abundant mountain resources are suitable for building school buildings and experimental sites, the cadres going up the mountains are the best teachers, and the labor experience of the cadres is ready-made teaching material.

    培养建设山区的人材
    江西创办劳动大学
    本报讯  江西省打破常规，决定创办“共产主义劳动大学”。江西省“共产主义劳动大学”总校设在南昌市西郊的西山，在井冈山、庐山、大茅山等二十四个垦殖场各设一个分校。
    自从去冬江西省下放五万多干部开发和建设山区以来，江西省党政领导机关和有关部门经常收到全省和全国各地青年的信，要求参加江西山区的开发和建设工作。江西省创办共产主义劳动大学，将充分满足这一要求。
    江西省共产主义劳动大学总校和各分校，将根据具体情况分别设立农业、林业、工业等若干科系。
    总校教授和教学人员由省人民委员会解决，各分校由各垦殖场解决，不足部分由所在专署配备；此外，省委和省人民委员会还将组织巡回讲学团协助教学。
    江西省共产主义劳动大学于7月1日开始在全省各地和全国范围内招生。劳动大学学习年限为二年到四年，毕业后发给文凭，统一分配，或自行就业。
    共产主义劳动大学总校最近召开了各分校校长、党委书记第一次联系会议。省长邵式平、省委书记方志纯、省委书记兼总校校长刘俊秀，都到会分别作了报告。邵式平在报告中说到创办共产主义劳动大学的目的和任务，是具体贯彻执行技术革命和文化革命，培养农业、林业、畜牧业、渔业、工业各方面的具有共产主义风格、又红又专的人材。坚决贯彻执行勤工俭学、半工半读、理论与实践相结合的办学方针。招收学生与资产阶级学校有原则区别。第一要求政治条件好；第二劳动好；第三是文化程度。总之，要尽量多招收些工农子弟。
    各分校校长、党委书记在会上进行了热烈的讨论，一致认为：在山区建立起共产主义劳动大学，是进一步开发山区，繁荣山区经济和文化的有力保证。同时，认为在山区开办大学有许多有利条件：丰富的山区资源适宜建立校舍和实验场地，上山的干部就是最好的教员，干部的劳动经验就是现成的教材。
