Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives and the Ministry of Light Industry jointly convened a National Technical Revolution Conference of Handicraft Cooperatives in Beijing from June 20th to 23rd. The conference called on the nation's five million-plus handicraft laborers to unleash their daring and innovative spirit to launch a great technical revolution and to shift the backward handicraft industry onto a new technical foundation within two to three years.

    Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Fear Neither Heaven nor Earth, Dare to Think and Dare to Act; Handicraft Industry Launches a Great Technical Revolution." Tian Ping, Deputy Director, delivered a report on the issue of cooperative factories. After repeated discussions, the delegates unanimously agreed that implementing a technical revolution in the handicraft industry is of great significance politically and economically. The concurrent development of industry and agriculture has resulted in an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, demanding that the handicraft industry supply various agricultural tools, agricultural machinery, and farmland water conservancy machinery. In particular, the widespread blooming of county and township industries also requires the handicraft industry to supply various machinery and equipment. At the same time, the handicraft industry is also a good foundation for developing local industries. Currently, in the country's more than 2,000 counties, approximately 60% of the counties' industrial output is predominantly from handicrafts. In 1957, handicrafts accounted for more than 80% of the industrial output below the special district and county levels. Therefore, when developing local industries, fully utilizing handicraft cooperatives as a foundation, and conducting expansion and new construction in a planned manner, can achieve the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical results. However, the current state of the handicraft industry is not commensurate with this task. In 1957, on average, only about 3% of the nation's handicraft cooperatives had implemented mechanization, with the vast majority still relying on heavy manual labor, resulting in very low labor productivity. In cooperatives with more than 100 people that have not implemented mechanization, the average output value per person per year is only three to four thousand yuan, equivalent to one-tenth of the average annual output value per worker in large, modern state-owned industries. Therefore, to implement the general line of socialist construction, the handicraft industry must carry out a technical revolution and advance towards semi-mechanization and mechanization.

    The conference believes that the key to implementing a technical revolution in the handicraft system lies in liberating thought, discarding feelings of inferiority, and promoting a daring, outspoken, and proactive spirit of innovation. At the conference, many delegates examined their past tendency to look down on the handicraft industry and their doubts about whether the handicraft industry could be mechanized and whether it could produce major products. After visiting the exhibition before this conference, this feeling of inferiority was shattered. A small exhibition attached to this conference showcased more than 200 products, demonstrating that handicraft cooperatives or cooperative factories in many regions have already manufactured large machinery that they previously dared not even imagine, such as gantry planers, blowers, air compressors, and portable steam engines. Some cooperatives have also manufactured precision instruments such as thousandth calipers, compasses, and electronic high-temperature control instruments, as well as ball bearings. These all illustrate that there are many "capable people" and "local experts" in the handicraft industry, and fully leveraging their roles will make amazing contributions to socialist construction. The conference called on handicraft leadership organs in various localities to fully care for and support the inventions and creations of handicraft workers, and to help them summarize, improve, and promote them.

    Regarding the steps to implement a technical revolution in the handicraft industry, the conference believes that, from the perspective of a single handicraft cooperative, the technical revolution should start with the weakest links in production and the most physically demanding manual labor. From a national perspective, the machinery, electrical, iron, and wood industries in large and medium-sized cities must take the lead, arming those cooperatives in these industries that have the necessary conditions first, so that they can manufacture the machinery and equipment needed by small-scale local industries and handicrafts below the special district and county levels. This is to first cultivate "hens" and then let the "hens lay eggs." However, for handicraft cooperatives in these industries to produce machinery and equipment, they must first solve the problem of raw materials for the machines—steel, iron, etc. Therefore, the conference called on various localities to quickly investigate resources and vigorously develop raw material bases, striving for the national handicraft system to produce three to five million tons of gray pig iron in 1959, and to develop small-scale steel mills on this basis, gradually achieving the goal of not only meeting the needs of the handicraft industry itself, but also providing a portion of steel and machinery and equipment to the state.

    Through the exchange of experiences, the conference concluded that three basic experiences must be paid attention to when implementing a technical revolution in the handicraft industry: relying on the masses and self-reliance (but a small number of important machinery and equipment in key factories still cannot be separated from state support); doing everything possible and practicing diligence and thrift; and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and coordinating in all aspects. The delegates participating in the conference had great enthusiasm, and many regions proposed plans to gradually achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    Before the conference, delegates from various localities visited more than ten grassroots handicraft cooperatives and cooperative factories in Beijing, Shenyang, Dalian, and other cities where the technical revolution had been carried out well, and gained a lot of inspiration.

    千方百计向半机械化机械化挺进
    手工业者动员起来大闹技术革命
    据新华社23日讯  中华全国手工业合作总社和轻工业部20日到23日在北京联合召开全国手工业合作社技术革命会议，号召全国五百多万手工业劳动者发扬敢想敢干的独创精神，大闹技术革命，在两三年内把落后的手工业转移到新的技术基础上来。
    中华全国手工业合作总社副主任邓洁在会上作了“天不怕、地不怕、敢想敢干，手工业大闹技术革命”的报告，副主任田坪作了关于合作工厂问题的报告。到会代表经过反复讨论，一致认为手工业实行技术革命在政治上、经济上都具有重大的意义。工农业同时并举的结果，农业生产出现了空前大跃进的局面，要求手工业供给各种农具、农业机械和农田水利机械，特别是县乡工业的遍地开花，也要求手工业供给各种机器设备。同时手工业也是发展地方工业的良好基础。目前全国二千多个县中，约有60％左右的县绝大部分工业就是手工业，1957年专区、县以下的工业产值中，手工业占80％以上。因此在发展地方工业时，充分利用手工业合作社作为基础，有计划地进行扩建和新建，就能达到多快好省的要求。但是目前手工业的状况却与这一任务很不相称，1957年全国平均只有
  3％左右的手工业合作社实行了机械化，绝大部分还是繁重的手工操作，劳动生产率很低，一百人以上未实行机械化的合作社，每人每年平均产值只有三千到四千元，相当于国营现代化大工业每个工人每年平均产值的十分之一。因此手工业要贯彻社会主义建设总路线，必须实行技术革命，向半机械化和机械化进军。
    会议认为手工业系统实行技术革命的关键在于解放思想、打掉自卑感，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的独创精神。会上许多代表都检查了过去轻视手工业，怀疑手工业能否机械化、能否出产重大产品。经过这次会议前的参观，这种自卑感打破了。这次会议附设的一个小型展览会展出的二百多种产品说明，不少地区的手工业合作社或合作工厂已经制造出过去想都不敢想的龙门刨床、鼓风机、空气压缩机、锅驼机等大型机械；有的合作社还制造出千分卡钳、罗盘仪、电子高温控制仪等精密仪器和滚珠轴承。这些都说明手工业中“能人”、“土专家”很多，充分发挥他们的作用，对社会主义建设将会作出惊人的贡献。会议要求各地手工业领导机关要充分关心和支持手工业者的发明创造，并帮助他们总结提高加以推广。
    关于手工业实行技术革命的步骤问题，会议认为，从一个手工业社来说，技术革命应当从生产最薄弱、体力劳动最笨重的环节做起。从全国范围来说，必须以大中城市的机、电、铁、木四个行业带头，把这些行业中有条件的合作社先武装起来，使他们能制造专区、县以下的小型地方工业和手工业所需要的机器设备；这就是先培养“母鸡”，然后让“母鸡下蛋”。但是要使这些行业的手工业社生产出机器设备，首先还必须自己解决机器的原料——钢、铁等问题。因此，会议要求各地迅速调查资源，大搞原料基地，争取1959年全国手工业系统能生产灰生铁三百万至五百万吨，并在此基础上发展小型炼钢厂，要逐步做到不但能满足手工业本身的需要，而且还能拿出一部分钢铁和机器设备交给国家。
    会议通过交流经验，认为手工业在实行技术革命时必须注意三点基本经验，这就是：依靠群众、自力更生（但重点工厂的少数重要机器设备仍离不开国家的支援）；千方百计，不离勤俭；土洋结合，各方面协作。参加会议的代表们干劲很大，许多地区提出了逐步实现机械化、半机械化的规划。
    这次会议在召开之前，各地代表曾到北京、沈阳、旅大等市参观访问了十多个技术革命开展得较好的手工业基层社和合作工厂，得到了很多启发。
