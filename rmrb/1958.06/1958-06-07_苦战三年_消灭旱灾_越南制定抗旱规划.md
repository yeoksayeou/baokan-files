Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 5th: Vietnamese Minister of Water Conservancy, Tran Dang Khoa, published an article in "People's Daily" stating that North Vietnam will basically eliminate drought by 1961.

The article stated that a three-year plan to gradually overcome drought will begin this autumn. Each province, county, and township will formulate their own drought resistance plans based on the overall plan.

Tran Dang Khoa said that currently, Vietnamese agriculture has not yet broken free from its dependence on nature. Therefore, farmers have to fight drought at the beginning of summer plowing, but need to combat waterlogging and floods during the autumn harvest.

Tran Dang Khoa wrote that the way to eliminate drought is to control and manage water resources. Specifically, it means organizing farmers to build ridges in paddy fields to store water, and digging a large number of water storage ponds, especially large ponds. In addition, many rivers and canals in North Vietnam will be utilized during the dry season. Where water cannot be stored and river water cannot be used, deep wells will be dug. The article pointed out that North Vietnam will also build a number of reservoirs and sluice gates in the future, and construct a number of pumping stations along the rivers.

Currently, Vietnam will make full use of its existing large-scale irrigation projects, while also building new projects to expand its irrigated area.

    苦战三年　消灭旱灾
    越南制定抗旱规划
    据新华社河内5日电　越南水利部长陈登科在“人民报”发表一篇文章说，越南北部将在1961年以前基本上消灭旱灾。
    文章写道，一项逐渐战胜干旱的三年计划将于今年秋天开始进行。每个省、每个县和每个乡都将根据总的计划订下它们自己的抗旱计划。
    陈登科说，目前，越南农业还没有摆脱依赖自然的现象。因此，农民在夏耕开始时要抗旱，在秋收时却需要同内涝和洪水战斗。
    陈登科写道，消除干旱的办法是支配和控制水源。具体说来是组织农民在稻田筑畦蓄水，挖掘大量蓄水的池塘，特别是大池塘。此外，在旱季还将利用北越的许多河川和运河。凡是不能蓄水和利用河水的地方将挖深的水井。文章指出，越南北部将来还要建一批水库和水闸，并且沿着江河兴建一批抽水站。
    目前，越南将充分利用它的现有的大规模灌溉工程，同时兴建新的工程来扩大它的灌溉面积。
