A Tale of Scaling the Wall (Short Story)
Ji Xuepei

As dusk approached, my landlord, Elder Brother Zhang Yongkui, returned from the Guanshan Reservoir.

He had been supporting the Guanshan Reservoir project for three and a half months. This time, he wasn’t back for a break or a holiday. In his own words, he was back to “take care of the food for the gang.”

My sister-in-law was naturally very happy to see Elder Brother return. She first heated a basin of water for him to wash his feet, and then went to fetch a few eggs to cook.

Just then, the production team leader, Wang Erbing, arrived. After sitting down, he first inquired about the situation at the construction site and how everyone was doing. Then, he began to talk to Elder Brother about the current production situation in the team...

Elder Brother was also a member of the team committee, so he was naturally very concerned about the team's production. As he listened… he frowned and asked, "Can the spring land be converted before the wheat harvest?"

"It's tight!" Wang Erbing shook his head, smiling, "But we can manage."

Elder Brother thought for a moment and said, "Then we have to take some measures!"

"Exactly," Wang Erbing continued, "We've already added a few night shifts." He paused and added, "Here's what we're thinking: Our team has a big task of converting fields. We have to convert two hundred mu of stubble fields after the wheat harvest. If we don't find a way to finish converting the spring land before the wheat is ripe, we'll have to harvest wheat, convert fields, prepare fields, and transplant rice all at once. How can we take care of the spring land then?"

Elder Brother nodded, saying, "That's right, that's right!"

After dinner, my sister-in-law and I were going to work the night shift. Elder Brother asked us, "Which field are you converting tonight?"

I blurted out, "West Back Slope."

For some reason, my sister-in-law glared at me and said to Elder Brother, "You should rest. You've traveled a hundred or so li; you must be tired enough. Besides, you have to travel early tomorrow morning. No matter how big the task is, it won't make much difference if you go and do a little bit."

Elder Brother chuckled when he heard this. But I felt very uneasy.

It was a dark night. As soon as we stepped out of the house, we couldn't see anything. I walked in front, and my sister-in-law followed behind. As we stepped out the front door, my sister-in-law stopped. I heard the front door creak, the door knocker rattled, and then with a "clang," the door was locked.

I felt relieved and happy, thinking to myself, "Now it's really safe."

That night, my sister-in-law and I, along with our group, took charge of a field. It was so dark that no one could see anyone's face clearly. We could only vaguely see where it was high, where it was low, where it should be raised, and where it should be filled. Besides, this was just the first stage; we just needed to create an outline, and then we could take care of it properly during field preparation.

The weather was cool, perfect for working. We worked without talking, only hearing the clods of earth flying about.

Suddenly, my sister-in-law shouted behind me, "Who's that? Can't you throw lighter? You got dirt all over someone's neck!"

No one answered, only the clods of earth continued to fly. ...

After a while, my sister-in-law shouted again, "You! What good stuff have you been eating at home? Why are you so strong? Can't you throw it lighter?"

Still, no one answered. The clods of earth continued to fall on our heels.

This time, my sister-in-law got angry. She stuck her shovel into the ground and said angrily, "I want to see who you are, so stubborn!" As she said this, she walked towards that person.

"Hey! Do your work!" I heard Elder Brother's voice, low and suppressed, "What are you shouting about?"

My sister-in-law stopped abruptly, stretched her neck, and looked. Angrily she asked, "Oh! How did you get here?"

"I rode a horse." Elder Brother's voice carried a smile.

My sister-in-law sighed deeply.

"Let me tell you, the dirt has to be thrown further out; you're throwing it too close," Elder Brother said, panting loudly as he threw dirt, "Didn't you see, the outside is very low; it needs to be filled heavily."

"I know, I know!" My sister-in-law walked back, grumbling, "You weren't at home; people couldn't work."

When we returned from work, Elder Brother walked in front of me. I poked his waist, laughing, and asked, "How did you get out?"

Elder Brother didn't answer. He grabbed my hand and pulled me forward, indicating: ahead.

I looked ahead and recognized that the person walking ahead was indeed my sister-in-law.

The night was very quiet. The sky was full of stars, each one as bright as crystal.

People who had worked all day and night now felt relaxed, so their spirits were particularly high. Some talked, some laughed, giggling and laughing, the road filled with laughter.

But my sister-in-law was silent, walking quickly. She seemed to be trying to catch up to the front.

Elder Brother whispered in my ear, chuckling, "You see, she's angry with me."

I said, "Who told you to run out?"

Elder Brother laughed and said, "You tell me, everyone is working the night shift; how could I sleep?"

When we reached the front door, my sister-in-law was unlocking the lock. Seeing us coming, she ignored us. But I was really puzzled: the door was still locked from the outside; how did Elder Brother get out?

My sister-in-law pushed open the door, leaned the shovel against the wall with a "clang," and went straight into the house. I grabbed Elder Brother's sleeve and said, "Tell me, how did you get out?"

Elder Brother took the flashlight from my hand and shone it on the base of the east wall. Then, I saw an old door panel leaning against a low wall.

I couldn't help but laugh. Elder Brother nudged me and said, "Just watch! Tonight, she'll definitely nag half the night." ...

    越墙记（小小说）
    吉学霈
    傍晚时分，我的房东大哥张永魁从官山水库回来了。
    他去支援官山水库，已经三个半月了，这次回来，一不是放工，二不是休假，拿他自己的话说，是给大伙“办粮饭”呢。
    大嫂一见大哥回来，自然高兴的很。先烧了一盆热水让他洗脚，自己就去取了几个鸡蛋下厨房了。
    正在这时候，生产队长王二炳来了。坐下以后，先问了问工地情况，又问了问大伙身体可好，随后，就向大哥谈起眼下队里的生产情况来。……
    大哥也是队委委员，自然对队里的生产非常关心。听着听着……眉头一皱问道：“赶麦收前春地能改得完吗？”
    “紧哪！”王二炳晃晃头，笑着说：“反正够招架的了。”
    大哥想了想，说道：“那得采取点措施呀！”
    “可不嘛，”王二炳接上说：“我们已经加了几个夜班啦。”停了停，又说：“我们是这样考虑的：咱们队里，改田任务大。麦收后光茬子要改二百亩。麦前要不想办法把春地改完，等麦一熟，又要收麦，又要改田、又要整田，又要插秧，哪还顾得上春地呢？”
    大哥点点头说：“那是哩，那是哩！”
    吃过晚饭，大嫂和我要去加夜班了。大哥问我们：“今晚在那块地里改呀？”
    我的嘴快，说：“西后坡。”
    不知为什么，我这样一说，大嫂瞪了我一眼，对大哥说：“你歇着吧，跑百十里路，够累的了。再说，明天一早还要赶路呢。任务再大，也不差你去干那一点儿。”
    大哥一听，嘿嘿嘿笑了。我可觉得心里很不自在。
    这是月黑夜，刚一出屋门，什么也看不见。我在前面走，大嫂在后面跟。走出大门，大嫂停下了，只听大门吱吜一声，门环响了一下，然后就砰嚓一声落了锁。
    我放心了，也高兴了，暗想：“这一下可真保险了。”
    这天晚上，我和大嫂她们一组人包下一块田。天很黑，谁也看不清谁的脸。只是模模糊糊的看到那处高，那处低，那处该起，那处该填；再说，这又是头道，只要先改出个轮廓来，等整田的时候，再好好拾掇。
    天很凉快，这是正适于干活的时候。我们干着，谁也不说话，只听见土块子“日——日”乱飞。
    突然，大嫂在我后面叫起来了：“那谁？你不会撂的轻一些吗？弄人家一脖子土！”
    没人接腔，只听见土块“日——日”乱飞。……
    过了一阵，大嫂又叫起来了：“你这人，在家吃啥好的了，那么大劲？不会轻些甩吗？”
    仍没人接腔，土块子还是噼嚓噼嚓直往脚跟上落。
    这一来大嫂火了，把撒锨往地上一插，气呼呼的说：“要我看看你是谁，这样顽固！”说着，就往那人跟前走去。
    “咄！干你的吧！”我听见这是大哥的腔口，低低的压着嗓子：“吵喝什么？”
    大嫂陡的站住了，伸着脖子看了看，生气的问：“哟！你怎么来了？”
    “骑马来的。”大哥话音里带着笑。
    大嫂长长叹了口气。
    “给你说，土得再往外面撂，你们撂的近了，”大哥一边撂着土，大声喘着气说：“你没看，外面低的很呢，需得狠狠填哩。”“知道知道！”大嫂往回走着发牢骚：“你没在家人家都没有干活。”
    散工回来的时候，大哥走在我的前面，我捅捅他的腰笑着问：“你怎么出来的？”
    大哥没有回答，抓住我的手往前面拉了拉，意思说：前面。
    我向前面一看，认出前面走的正是大嫂。
    夜是很静的。满天繁星，颗颗都像水晶那样透亮。
    劳动了一天一夜的人们，现在身子觉得松闲了，因此，兴致格外好。有人说，有人笑，嘻嘻哈哈，满路笑声。
    可是大嫂却不言不语，急急的走着。看样子，像是想竭力赶到前面去呢。
    大哥咬住我的耳朵吃吃笑着说：“你瞧，她可是生我的气了。”
    我说：“谁教你跑出来呢？”
    大哥笑着说：“你说，大家都在加夜班，我能睡得成吗？”
    赶我们来到大门跟前时，大嫂正在用钥匙开锁，见我们来，也不理会。可是我实在纳闷了：门还从外面锁着，大哥是怎么出来的呢？
    大嫂推开门，“砰啷”一声把撒锨往墙上一靠，就径直向上房屋里走了。我一把抓住大哥的袖子说：“告诉我，你是怎么出去的？”
    大哥从我手里接过电灯，往东墙跟处照了一下。这时，我看见一道低矮矮的墙上，靠着一块旧门板。
    我禁不住笑了。大哥捅了我一下说：“瞧着吧！今晚保险她得唠叨半夜。”……
