    Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: De Gaulle delivered a speech in Algiers on the evening of the 4th, saying that from this day on, there would only be one kind of resident in the entire territory of Algeria: "thorough" French citizens. De Gaulle's remarks blatantly revealed his policy of colonial rule.
    De Gaulle described the French colonial army's armed suppression of the Algerian national liberation movement as a "magnificent work." He praised the colonial army for participating in this fascist riot and said that he "trusted" them and would "rely on them" now and in the future.
    After announcing France's determination to annex Algeria, De Gaulle said that he was prepared, within the next three months, to have ten million local residents (of whom nine million were Muslims and only one million were French immigrants) hold elections to "decide their own destiny."
    An authoritative figure from the Algerian National Liberation Front in Tunis pointed out that De Gaulle's speech did not acknowledge the principle of independence for which the Algerian people have been fighting, which undermined the basis for achieving reconciliation between France and Algeria.

    戴高乐在阿尔及尔鼓吹殖民政策
    叫嚣要吞并阿尔及利亚
    据新华社5日讯　戴高乐4日傍晚在阿尔及尔发表演讲说，从这一天起，阿尔及利亚全境将只存在唯一的一种居民：“十足的”法籍公民。戴高乐的这一番话露骨地表明了他的殖民统治的政策。
    戴高乐把法国殖民军用武力镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动说成是一件“宏伟的工作”。他称赞殖民军队参加这次法西斯暴乱，并且说，他“信任”他们，现在和将来“都将依仗他们”。
    戴高乐在宣布法国决心要并吞阿尔及利亚之后说，他准备在今后三个月内，使一千万当地居民（其中有九百万是穆斯林，只有一百万是法籍移民）举行选举，“决定他们自己的命运”。
    驻突尼斯的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线权威人士指出，戴高乐的讲话丝毫也不承认阿尔及利亚人民一直在为之进行斗争的独立原则，这使得实现法国同阿尔及利亚之间的和解失去基础。
