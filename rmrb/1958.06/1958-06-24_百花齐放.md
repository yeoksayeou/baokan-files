    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    88  Canna: Some say we are so-called talented writers, but the pen must be used with blood to write. A poem that doesn't vomit out one's heart and soul is definitely not a good poem. Writing poetry seems easy, but it's actually not. The common people call us "状元红" (Top Scholar Red), and they know best how to produce a top scholar. They are always engaged in production with all their heart and soul. Whoever learns this spirit is a hero.
    89  Snapdragon: Who said a string of goldfish pierced through a willow branch? (Note) But why isn't it drooping, but standing straight? It's better to say a school of goldfish darted into the algae. Isn't this image more vivid and wonderful? In short, we are very pleased to be compared to goldfish, but goldfish are active, while the flowers bloom all year round; Comrade Goldfish brought a message yesterday: "The river has gone up the mountain, and I don't want to live in the water anymore."
    (Note) The Japanese call snapdragons "金鱼草" (Goldfish Grass) because the flower shape resembles goldfish.
    90  Summer Cypress: We are a kind of artemisia that blooms in autumn. Our foreign name is Cosmos, and our Chinese name is Summer Cypress (扫帚梅). (Note) Artemisia representing the universe is a bit too un-self-effacing. Brooms can sweep away dirt, which suits our taste. Our slender artemisia body is sometimes taller than people. Because we are a collective, we show strength. We bloom collectively in pinkish-white, pink, and dark red, with simple seven petals, gracefully whistling in the west wind.
    (Note) The foreign name is Cosmos, meaning the universe. The Chinese name is also called Large Cosmos or Autumn Cherry.
    91  Monkshood: The scientific name is Aconitum, don't be surprised. (Note) Purple-blue flowers bloom vigorously in autumn. The Chinese gardens love to cultivate us and gave us a strange name according to our flower shape - monk's shoe. We are poisonous, but our use is great. Our roots can treat scrofula, swelling and itching, athlete's foot, and other ailments. We can promote urination, kill insects, and also have an anesthetic effect. After dialectical unity, poisonous weeds become fragrant flowers.
    (Note) Aconitum, the toxin it contains is called Aconitine.
    92  Hydrangea: When mentioning hydrangea, one must think of the lion, and when mentioning the lion, one must think of the hydrangea. Today's People's China is an awakened lion, and our hydrangea must give full play to its energy. The flower color can change seven times, and the flowering period is very long. It doesn't choose its location and can be planted in shady corners. Dried leaves, when decocted, can cure malaria. As long as I can serve the people, what does fame and fortune mean to me!
    93  Geranium: Our origin is in southern Africa, and the name is geranium or洋绣球 (foreign hydrangea). We are loved very much when we come to China. Wherever there are flowers, there are us. We are not in the same family as hydrangea, but that doesn't matter; adding the word "foreign" or "天竺" (Tian Zhu, ancient name for India) doesn't concern us. Please note that there is a horseshoe mark in the heart of the leaf, which is to encourage everyone to gallop forward with ten thousand horses.
    94  Dianthus plumarius: We and Dianthus chinensis and Dianthus superbus are sisters. The stem has knots and is hollow, and the leaves resemble bamboo leaves. The petals are thousands of layers, the flower color is diverse, the flower fragrance is faint, the stalk is long, drought-resistant, and afraid of listening to noise. Listening for a long time will cause us to wither. Beijing's flower houses love to add legs to snakes and want to dye us, which is really a torment. You often see colored ivory statues, do you think they are beautiful? Not beautiful at all.
    95  Balloon flower: Balloon flower is a common name in Chinese medicine. We are used for colds, coughs, and indigestion. Korean friends also use us as food; but I'm afraid few people have seen the flowers. The flowers have single petals and double petals and are five-lobed bell-shaped. The Japanese say that purple represents balloon flower. We grow wild on sunny mountainsides. For the health of the people, we are willing to dedicate our lives.
    96  Dahlia: Some people also call us 天竺牡丹 (Tian Zhu Peony). Even we find it difficult to distinguish between our many varieties. Our tubers are a bit like sweet potatoes, and our flowers are not far from chrysanthemums. Since coming to China, we have been thinking: if our roots can become food, then we can be regarded as economic plants, wouldn't that be more useful to the 600 million people?

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    88  美人蕉有人说我们是所谓生花的笔，但是，要由执笔的人用血来写。不呕出心血的诗决不是好诗，做诗好像容易，实际并不容易。老百姓有的叫我们为状元红，怎样才能出状元，老百姓最懂。他们总是呕心喋血地从事生产，谁学得这种精神，谁就是好汉。
    89  柳穿鱼是谁说，一条柳枝穿上一串金鱼？（注）却怎么并不是下垂，而是直竖？倒不如说，一群金鱼窜进了水藻。这形象岂不是更要生动而佳妙？总之，比成金鱼我们是非常惬意，但金鱼是活动的，花朵周年不谢；金鱼同志昨天却带了个口信来：“河水都上了山，不愿长住在水里。”
    （注）日本人称柳穿鱼为金鱼草，以花形似金鱼。
    90  扫帚梅我们是秋天开花的一种蒿草类，外文名是宇宙花，中文名扫帚梅。（注）蒿草要代表宇宙，未免太不自卑，扫帚可以扫除污秽，倒合乎口胃。我们纤细的蒿体有时比人还长，由于是集体成群，就显示了力量。我们集体地开花，粉白、粉红、深红，简简单单的七瓣，娉婷啸傲西风。
    （注）外文为Cosmos，即宇宙之意。中文名或称为大波斯菊或者秋樱。
    91  僧鞋菊学名叫阿科尼同，不要见怪，（注）紫碧色的花朵在秋季盛开。中国的庭园中爱栽培我们，根据花形给了个怪名——僧鞋。我们有毒，但我们的用处很大，根可医瘰疬、肿痒，脚气及其他。可以利尿、杀虫，还有麻醉作用，经过辩证统一，毒草变成香花。
    （注）Aconitum，其中所含毒素即名Aconitin，（阿科尼丁）。
    92  绣 球提到绣球就一定要联想到狮子，提到狮子也一定要联想到绣球。今天的人民中国是醒了的狮子，我们绣球也就一定要鼓足劲头。花色能有七变，花期又十分长久，不择地位，可以种植在阴辟墙坳。阴干的叶子，煎服，可以医治疟疾，只要能服务人民，名利于我何有！
    93  洋绣球我们的原产地是南部非洲，名称叫天竺葵或者洋绣球。我们来到中国很受到爱好，凡是有花的地方，到处都有。和绣球并不同科，但不要紧；加个洋字或天竺也不关心。请注意，叶心都有个马蹄痕，那是要大家万马奔腾，鼓劲。
    94  千叶石竹我们和剪春罗、剪秋罗是姊妹，茎有节而中空，叶和竹叶相类。花瓣千叶，花色多样，花香清微，梗长耐旱，怕听骚音，听久会萎。北京的花房爱在蛇身上加腿，要替我们染色，真是令人受罪。着色的象牙雕像也常常看到，你们以为美吗？一点儿也不美。
    95  桔梗花桔梗在中药中是常见的药名，伤风、咳嗽、消化不良，都用我们，朝鲜朋友还把我们当成食品；可是看过花的，怕就没有几人。花有单瓣，有双瓣，是五裂钟形，日本人说紫色就代表以桔梗。我们是在向阳的山地中野生，为了人民健康，深愿献出生命。
    96  大丽花有人又叫我们是天竺牡丹，种类之多连我们也难分辨。我们的球根很有点像番薯，我们的花倒和菊花不相远。自到中国来就在这样作想：假使我们的根能成为食粮，那吗我们就可算经济植物，岂不对六亿人民更有用场？
