    7日午夜前后在尼科西亚有上千的土耳其族居民手执铁器和刀子等冲入了这个城中希腊族居民的居住区，向从睡梦中惊起的希腊族居民发起攻击，结果有两名希腊族居民被打死，有五十九名希腊族居民受伤，其中有两人受重伤。冲入希腊居民区的土耳其居民还放火烧毁了这个地区的许多商店，使希腊居民的财产受到很大损失。他们进行这次袭击时高呼着要求分治塞浦路斯的口号。8日在东南部的拉纳加发生的同样事件中又有两名希腊居民死亡，两名希腊居民受重伤，许多希腊居民开设的商店被捣毁。
    同一天，土耳其外交部发表了一项公报说，土耳其已经作出“完全的和成熟的决定，要实现塞浦路斯的分治”。这一天在伊斯坦布尔还举行了一次宣传塞浦路斯分治的群众集会。
