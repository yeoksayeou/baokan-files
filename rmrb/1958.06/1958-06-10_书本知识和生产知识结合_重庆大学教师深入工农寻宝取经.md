Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 9th: Chongqing University teachers have undergone the "Double-Anti" campaign, the movement to confide in the Party, and participation in labor training. Their work style and mental outlook have undergone changes.

In teaching and scientific research, teachers have clarified their thinking on serving the general line of building socialism, and changed the phenomenon of being divorced from production and current political tasks. For example, out of the 141 scientific research topics set by the university last year, only eight were related to production; this year, out of the 116 topics set, 86 are closely related to current production. The Department of Mechanical Engineering sent more than 30 people to factories to make contact and collect research topics. Teachers from the Department of Metallurgy undertook the design task of the Beibei Iron Smelting Plant and assisted the plant in its construction and future production work. This department also researched 19 kinds of substitute alloy steel for Chongqing's steel plants, and nine have already been smelted, which can save the country a large amount of rare metals. Teachers and students from the Department of Power Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering vigorously supported the realization of electrification in rural suburbs, helped several units such as the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative to build small hydropower stations and biogas power stations, and decided to use this as a research topic to summarize and study a set of design problems for various small power stations suitable for rural areas in Sichuan.

Liking to run to factories and rural areas is a new trend that has emerged among teachers after the rectification movement. Teachers call learning from workers and peasants and discovering and researching problems on site "seeking treasures and learning from experience." Some teachers used to bury themselves in books and always refer to foreign countries. After arriving at the mine, they realized that the monthly tunneling record of the Zhongliangshan inclined shaft had reached more than 200 meters, while they were still telling students in class that the monthly progress was more than 100 meters. An assistant teacher had previously designed a four-cycle tunneling process, believing that this design was difficult to achieve under the existing coal mine mining conditions in China. This time, he saw that the Zhongliangshan West inclined shaft was using four cycles, and the operation was much more practical than he had originally considered. Lin Yanxian, an associate professor in the Department of Metallurgy, said that he had encountered a lot of knowledge in participating in the design work of the Beibei Iron Smelting Plant that he had never learned before. In the past, the design simply pursued good and advanced, ignoring more, faster, better, and more economical results. This time, in practical work, he realized that the design of a component must consider the possibility of processing and the principles of local materials, economy, and durability to save costs. Wu Yunpeng, a young assistant teacher, helped the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative design and build a small hydropower station. The water diversion canal of this power station had to pass through a depression. According to book knowledge, he began to design it to be filled with earthwork, which was not only labor-intensive but also collapsed because the earthwork was not strong. Later, the method of making a wooden trough overhead proposed by the peasants was adopted, which was both economical and simple. After many teachers participated in production practice in factories and rural areas, they generally realized the importance of combining book knowledge with practical production knowledge and continuously absorbing nourishment and receiving education from practice.

    书本知识和生产知识结合
    重庆大学教师深入工农寻宝取经
    据新华社重庆9日电　重庆大学教师经过“双反”、向党交心运动和参加劳动锻炼，工作作风和精神面貌都发生了变化。
    在教学和科学研究方面，教师们明确了为建设社会主义的总路线服务的思想，改变了脱离生产、脱离当前政治任务的现象。比如全校去年订出的一百四十一个科学研究题目，结合生产的只有八个；今年订出的一百一十六个题目中，就有八十六个是紧密结合当前生产的。机械系派了三十多人到工厂联系、收集研究题目。冶金系的教师担任了北碚炼铁厂的设计任务，并协助这个厂进行建厂和今后的生产工作。这个系还为重庆的钢铁厂研究十九种代用合金钢，现已炼出九种，可以为国家节约大量稀有金属。动力系、电机系的师生大力支援郊区农村实现电气化，帮助红旗农业社等几个单位修建了小型水力发电站、沼气发电站，并决定以此作为研究题目，总结、研究出一套适合四川农村的各种小型电站的设计问题。
    喜欢往工厂、农村跑，这是整风运动以后在教师中出现的新风气。教师们把向工农学习，到现场发现、研究问题叫做“寻宝取经”。有些教师过去埋头书本，言必称外国，到了矿山后，才知道中梁山平硐掘进月纪录已达到二百多公尺，而他们讲课时还在对学生讲月进一百多公尺。有一个助教过去曾作过四个循环的掘进设计，认为这个设计在我国现有煤矿开采条件下难以实现。这次他看到中梁山西平硐正是采用四个循环，而且操作上比他原来考虑的要切实得多。冶金系副教授林衍先说，他参加北碚炼铁厂的设计工作中所接触的知识，有很多是他从前没有学过的。过去设计单纯追求好和先进，忽视了多快好省，这次在实际工作中，才体会到设计一个构件，要考虑加工的可能性和就地取材、经济耐用等节约原则。青年助教吴云鹏帮助红旗农业社设计修建一座小型水电站，这个电站的引水渠要经过一个洼地，他按照书本知识开始设计用土方填，不但费人力而且因为土方不牢，填起来又垮了。后来采用了农民提出的做木槽架空的办法，既节约又简便。许多教师到工厂、农村参加生产实践后，普遍体会到把书本知识与实际生产知识相结合，不断从实际中吸取养料、接受教育的重要。
