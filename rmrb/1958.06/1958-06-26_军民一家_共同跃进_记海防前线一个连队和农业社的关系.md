Soldiers and Civilians as One Family, Advancing Together
——A Record of the Relationship Between a Company on the Coastal Defense Front and an Agricultural Cooperative
廖全我

The officers and soldiers of the 9th Company of Unit 9167, stationed in Huguang Cooperative, Guihu Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, actively helped the local township and cooperative with their work. In a short period, they transformed a notorious backward cooperative into a vibrant and advanced one. Therefore, the cadres and masses were very grateful to them and wrote to the provincial governor requesting that the company be stationed in their cooperative for a long time; the cooperative members also unanimously elected the company's political instructor as the deputy political director of the cooperative.

The Huguang Cooperative was a third-class cooperative with a relatively weak political atmosphere and poor production. It consisted of more than 600 households and was an overseas Chinese village on the coast of Jinjiang County. When the 9th Company of Unit 9167 moved here, some cooperative members did not allow the soldiers to dry their clothes upstairs, some were unwilling to lend their houses to the troops, and some even deliberately dirtied the places the troops had just cleaned. Faced with this situation, Cui Yousan, the political instructor of the company, and several leading cadres studied the problem and resolved to help the cooperative do a good job and strive to use the fine traditions and work style of the troops to influence the masses. The officers and soldiers discussed issues such as carrying forward the glorious traditions of the troops, participating in labor, taking the lead in doing a good job in the locality, improving military-civilian relations, and influencing the masses with their actions. From then on, the officers and soldiers adopted active assistance methods, participated in local central movements, and enthusiastically helped township and cooperative cadres politically and in their work. Cui Yousan, the company's political instructor, often participated in the cooperative's branch meetings and cooperative committee meetings to understand local work tasks and local conditions and help the branch and cooperative committee solve difficult problems. The troop's Communist Youth League organization also frequently participated in the township and cooperative Communist Youth League meetings and activities. Due to the enthusiastic help of the troops, the township and cooperative cadres also improved. Because the troop comrades had multiple contacts and directly participated in researching the work of the agricultural cooperative, they quickly became familiar with production issues. When some good people and good deeds appeared in the cooperative, the troops helped to compose clapper talks and write big-character posters to publicize and commend them. When publicizing and implementing the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program, the troops cooperated with the branch to organize a propaganda team to go to each household to carry out propaganda and open up the masses' thinking. It was also because of this that three individual households were persuaded to apply to join the cooperative.

Actively Laboring, Setting a Good Example

In the overseas Chinese village of Guihu, it was common to look down on labor and despise labor. Although these bad customs and habits had gradually changed after liberation, some people still did not have the habit of participating in labor. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the 9th Company used their own example of actively laboring to influence the masses. The 9th Company participated in all the cooperative's work such as repairing water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, improving soil, harvesting wheat, transplanting rice seedlings, and eliminating the four pests. In the three months of the Great Leap Forward, the comrades of the 9th Company contributed a total of 822 workdays, helped the cooperative repair water conservancy projects, dug more than 147,900 loads of soil, removed 5,130 loads of garbage, captured 1,725 rats and sparrows, and accumulated 45,340 loads of soil fertilizer. When the cooperative launched the "mechanization" movement, the company headquarters organized a carpentry team composed of several soldiers who knew carpentry to specialize in helping the cooperative repair carts.

Under the influence of the officers and soldiers of the 9th Company, the Huguang Cooperative, which was originally "not very confident, lacked enthusiasm, had a very low attendance rate, and was backward in everything," soon launched a mass movement to "catch up with the troops and learn from the hard-working spirit of the troops." When leveling the land, one day the masses were eating when they saw that the troops had already gone to work, so they urged, "Quick! Quick! The People's Liberation Army is gone, we have to hurry up and catch up." In the past few months, all the masses in the entire cooperative, except for the elderly and infirm and young children who could not participate in labor, have all turned out to participate in production, and the attendance rate has increased from about 40% of the total population to 88.4%. Some people who never participated in labor before can't stay idle now. They actively participate in various production labor, and some even do it very well. Cai Wuxue, a relative of an overseas Chinese who had never worked in the fields before, participated in labor and worked hard for several months without complaining. When someone asked her if she was tired, she smiled and said: "You won't be tired once you get used to labor."

The Military and Civilians Take a Great Leap Forward, Backwardness Becomes Advancement

With the help of the officers and soldiers of the 9th Company, the Huguang Cooperative worked hard for several months, and production has been very successful. The cooperative's arable land can now basically eliminate ordinary droughts, and all 2,506 mu of land have been improved, with more than 700 loads of soil and sand added per mu. More than 600,000 loads of soil fertilizer were accumulated in the spring plowing, exceeding the task by 20%, more than double the same period last year. Last year, the cooperative only raised 530 pigs, but now it has raised 1,320. In the movement to eliminate the four pests, the Huguang Cooperative became the first in Jinjiang County. Spring plowing work was earlier than in previous years, and technical measures were also better than in previous years. The backward cooperative's hat has been removed, and the people have renamed them - Red Flag Village, Red Flag Cooperative.

As Close as a Family, As Affectionate as Brothers

In addition to motivating the masses to work hard in production by actively laboring and setting a good example, the comrades of the 9th Company also often pay attention to using the fine style of the People's Army to influence and motivate the masses, and never lose their temper with the masses. For example, the landlord of the 5th and 6th squads was an old lady with backward thinking. She often poured urine and water from upstairs to downstairs. Sometimes the ground that the troops had just cleaned was dirtied by her, and once two soldiers were drenched in water. But the soldiers did not lose their temper. Afterwards, the troops cleaned the place spotlessly. The squad leader specially invited the old lady to visit and asked for her opinion, "Is it clean or not?" The old lady said, "Very good, very good." The squad leader took the opportunity to ask her to be careful when pouring water in the future. The old lady was moved and never poured water casually again.

When the masses have difficulties, the officers and soldiers help them. Eight households in the cooperative lacked labor to fetch water, and the soldiers often helped them carry it. Xu Chunnang, the landlord of the sixth squad, had difficulties going to other places to fetch firewood and buy rice. Soldiers You Yuzhen and Wang Fulin often helped her go to Yupu, four li away, to fetch firewood and rice. When the masses' houses were collapsed by heavy rain, the soldiers helped them repair them. These actions of the troops greatly moved the cooperative members. Some people examined their past shortcomings in not being enthusiastic about the troops. Everywhere in the township said that this was "Chairman Mao's good troops," and that the instructor was a "instructor without official airs." The masses deeply realized that the people's own troops cared for them with the utmost sincerity. Now the masses in the cooperative often chat with the soldiers and talk about their daily lives. Some masses hand over their children to the soldiers to take care of when they go to the fields to work during the day, and some even hand over the keys to the soldiers. They said, "If you need anything, just go to the room to get it, don't be polite." When the soldiers wash their clothes, the landlords ask them to take them upstairs to dry. Sometimes when the soldiers go out and it rains, the masses will also collect the soldiers' clothes and fold them up. If the quilts are torn, the masses will help them sew them up overnight. When the troops have guests, the neighbors will lend their houses and quilts to the troops. One day, the troops braved the rain to help the farm harvest wheat, and their clothes were soaked by the rain. The landlord Xu Chunnang immediately took off the wool clothes worn by herself and her son and gave them to the new comrades to wear. She often asked the soldiers if they were cold and sent boiled water and made porridge for the patients. The soldiers sometimes added the things sent by the landlord to the dishes they received and had a meal with their neighbors.

The troops and the masses are like one family. Now the military and civilians are advancing in high spirits on the basis of close unity and full cooperation!

    军民一家　共同跃进
    ——记海防前线一个连队和农业社的关系
    廖全我
    驻在福建省晋江县龟湖乡湖光社的九一六七部队九连官兵，积极帮助驻地乡社工作，在短短的期间内，把一个远近闻名的落后社改变成有声有色的先进社。因此，干部群众十分感激他们，向省长写信要求让这个连队长期驻在他们社里；社员们并一致推选连队政治指导员为政治副社长。
    湖光社是一个政治空气比较薄弱，生产也搞得很不好的三类社，一共有六百多户人家，是晋江县沿海的一个侨村。当九一六七部队九连移驻这里时，有的社员不让士兵们到楼上晒衣服，有的人不愿借房子给部队住，甚至还有人故意弄脏部队刚打扫干净的场所。面对着这种情况，这个连的政治指导员崔友三同志和几个领导干部作了研究，下决心帮助这个社搞好工作，并争取用部队的优良传统和作风来影响群众。官兵们讨论了发扬部队光荣传统，参加劳动，带头做好所在地工作，搞好军民关系，用自己行动来影响群众等问题。从那以后，官兵们就采取积极帮助的办法，参加当地的中心运动，热情地从政治上、从工作上来帮助乡、社干部，连的政治指导员崔友三同志经常参加合作社的支部会和社委会，从中了解地方上的工作任务和地方情况，并帮助支部、社委解决困难问题，部队的共青团组织也经常参加乡社共青团的会议活动。由于部队的热情帮助，乡社干部也有了提高，而部队同志由于多次接触和直接参加研究农业社的工作，也很快熟识了生产问题。社里出现了一些好人好事，部队就帮助编快板、写大字报宣传表扬。在宣传贯彻农业发展纲要四十条时，部队即配合支部组织了宣传队，深入到各户进行宣传，打通群众思想，也就是因为这样，有三户单干户被他们说服申请入了社。
    积极劳动，做好榜样
    在侨乡的龟湖村里，轻视劳动、鄙视劳动是较普遍的，解放后，这种坏的风俗习惯虽然逐步在改变，但是，有些人还没有参加劳动的习惯，因此，九连的官兵就用自己积极劳动的榜样来影响群众。凡是社里的修水利、积肥、改良土壤、割麦、插秧、除四害等工作，九连都参加。大跃进三个月来，九连的同志共出动了八百二十二个劳动日，帮助社里修水利，挖土十四万七千九百多担，清除垃圾五千一百三十担，捕鼠雀一千七百二十五只，积土肥四万五千三百四十担。当社里开展“车子化”运动时，连部又把原来几个会做木匠的战士组织一个木工小组，专门帮助社里修车子。
    在九连官兵的影响下，原来“信心不大，劲头不足，出勤率很低，样样落后”的湖光社，随即掀起了一个“赶上部队，向部队学习苦干精神”的群众运动。平整土地时，有一天群众正在吃饭，看到部队已经上工去了，就催着说：“快！快！解放军走了，我们要快些追上去”。几个月来，全社所有群众除了年老体衰和幼小孩子不能参加劳动外，凡能参加干轻重活的人都全部出动参加生产了，出勤率由原来占总人口40％左右增加到88.4％，有些从来不参加劳动的人，现在也呆不住了，他（她）们积极参加了各种生产劳动，有的还干得很出色。从没有下过田的侨眷蔡乌雪，参加了劳动后，一鼓气干了几个月也没有叫辛苦。有人问她累不累？她笑着说：劳动惯了就不累。
    军民大跃进，落后变先进
    在九连官兵的帮助下，湖光社苦干了几个月，生产搞得非常出色。全社耕地已经可以基本上消灭普通的旱灾了，二千五百零六亩土地也全部进行改良土壤，每亩加土沙七百多担。春耕中积了六十多万担土肥，超额完成任务20％，比去年同期增加二倍多。去年全社只养猪五百三十头，现在已养了一千三百二十头。在除四害运动中，湖光社成了晋江县的第一名。春耕工作比往年早，技术措施也比往年好，落后社的帽子摘掉了，人民重新给他们叫一个名字——红旗村，红旗社。
    亲如一家，情同兄弟
    九连同志除了以积极劳动、做好榜样来带动群众努力生产以外，还经常注意用人民部队优良的作风来感化群众，带动群众，从不对群众发脾气。如第五、六班住处的房东是一个思想落后的老太太，平时常常从楼上向楼下倒尿泼水，有时部队刚扫干净地就被她弄脏了，有一次还把两个战士淋得一身是水。但战士们并没有发脾气，随后部队把场所打扫得干干净净，班长特地请这个老太太来参观，并征求她的意见“扫得干净不干净？”这个老太婆说：“很好，很好”。班长就乘机请她以后倒水小心一点，老太婆受感动了，从此就不再随便泼水了。
    群众有困难，官兵们就帮助他们。这个社有八户劳力缺乏的群众吃水，经常是战士们帮助挑的。六班房东徐春娘到外地挑柴买米有困难，战士尤裕珍、王福林就经常帮她到四里地的玉铺去挑柴米；群众的房子被大雨冲坍了，战士们就帮助他们修好。部队的这些行动，大大感动社员群众，有的人自己检讨了过去对部队不热情的缺点，乡里到处都说这是“毛主席的好部队”，说指导员是“没官气的指导员”。群众深深体会到人民自己的部队，对自己的关心是至殷至切的。现在社里的群众经常找战士们谈心，畅叙家常。有些群众白天下田劳动时，就把孩子交给战士们代他照管，有的人连钥匙也交给战士，他们说：“你们要用什么东西就自己到房间去拿，不必客气”。战士洗衣服，房东都请他们拿到楼上披晒。有时战士们出去，天下雨了群众也会把战士的衣服收起来叠好；被子破了，群众会连夜帮助他们缝缝补补。部队有了客人，邻居会将自己住的房子和棉被借给部队。有一天，部队冒雨帮助农场抢收小麦，衣服被雨淋湿了，房东徐春娘马上脱下自己和他儿子身上穿的羊毛衣，给新同志穿，他平时经常对战士问冷问热，为病员送开水，做稀饭；战士们有时也把房东送的东西加上自己领来的菜和他们的邻居一起会餐。
    部队和群众就像一家人一样。现在军民正在紧密团结，充分协作的基础上高歌猛进！
