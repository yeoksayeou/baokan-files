　　印度尼西亚政府军在北苏拉威西挺进
    收复重要港口多里多里
    据新华社雅加达电  印度尼西亚陆军新闻处3日宣布，政府军已经收复了北苏拉威西的多里多里。在这之前，这座城市的居民已经采取行动反对盘据在当地的叛乱分子。多里多里是北苏拉威西的一个重要的港口城市，以前走私活动常常在这个城市和英属北婆罗洲之间进行。
    据北和中苏拉威西作战司令部向陆军总部发出的报告说，政府军在收复了浪加拉、巴鲁、巴里吉、彭多洛和多里多里以后，已经在这些地区加强了自己的阵地，以便把这些地区作为向叛乱分子进一步发动进攻的根据地。同时，政府军正在对逃进丛林中的叛乱分子加紧进行清剿。
    在前一天，陆军新闻处发言人说，包围哈马里拉岛首府济罗罗的政府军已经加强兵力，准备对那里的叛乱分子发动全面进攻。
