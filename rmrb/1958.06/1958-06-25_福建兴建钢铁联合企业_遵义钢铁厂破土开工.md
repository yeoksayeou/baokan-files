Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th – Fujian Province's first medium-sized iron and steel complex in history recently started construction in Sanming County, the old revolutionary base area in northern Fujian.

The iron and steel complex will have equipment such as iron-smelting blast furnaces, steel-making converters, electric furnaces, large and small rolling mills, seamless steel pipe machines, and thick and thin plate machines, as well as thermal power plants, general machinery plants, waterworks, and transformer substations. It will produce square steel, round steel, flat steel, channel steel, I-beam steel, light rails, seamless steel pipes, thick and thin plates, and other steel products for local industrial construction and production. After completion, it will greatly promote the development of local industry in Fujian.

All the iron ore needed for this iron and steel complex will be taken from within the province. According to a general survey, the province's iron ore resources are distributed in sixty-one counties, with a total of two hundred and twenty-five locations and reserves of over six hundred million tons, mostly rich ore.

This newspaper reports: A steel plant with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel in the historic city of Zunyi has recently broken ground.

The entire project of this steel plant is expected to be completed in 1960. In addition to making the necessary preparations for large-scale construction in 1959, some rolling and steelmaking workshops will be built this year; among them, two rolling and steelmaking workshops can be put into production by the end of this year.

    福建兴建钢铁联合企业
    遵义钢铁厂破土开工
    据新华社福州24日电　福建省有史以来第一座中型钢铁联合企业，最近在闽北革命老根据地三明县动工兴建。
    这座钢铁联合企业拥有炼铁高炉、炼钢转炉、电炉、大小轧钢机、无缝钢管机、厚薄板机等设备，还有热电站、通用机器厂、自来水厂和变电所等。它将生产方钢、圆钢、扁钢、槽钢、工字钢、轻轨、无缝钢管、厚薄板等各种地方工业建设和生产用的钢材。它建成后，将大大促进福建地方工业的发展。
    这座钢铁联合企业所需要的铁矿石全部取之于本省。据普查，全省铁矿资源遍布六十一个县，共有二百二十五处，储藏量达六亿吨以上，且多为富矿。
    本报讯　历史名城——遵义市的一座年产六十万吨钢的钢铁厂，最近破土开工了。
    这座钢铁厂预计全部工程在1960年竣工。今年除为1959年大量施工作必要的准备外，要修建部分轧钢、炼钢等车间；其中有两个轧钢炼钢车间，今年年底可以投入生产。　（赵兴华、余光伟）
