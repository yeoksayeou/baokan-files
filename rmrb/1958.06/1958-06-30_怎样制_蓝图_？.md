    How to Make "Blueprints"?
    Nigong
    We often see the words "construction blueprint" in newspapers. What is a blueprint?
    Usually, when building a house or manufacturing a machine, one must operate according to the drawings prepared by engineering technicians. The drawings show the style of the building, machine, and its components, with detailed dimensions. If the structure of the building or machine is relatively complex, and various components require division of labor, several copies of the same drawing are needed. For example, when building a house, some work is done on site, some is prefabricated in the workshop. Relevant trades like masons, carpenters, steelworkers, etc., all need drawings. The materials department needs to prepare materials and arrange the site based on the drawings. Construction personnel need to follow the drawings to guide operations, and the construction unit also needs drawings to be sent to relevant units for review. Therefore, the same drawing needs to be copied several times. The usual method of copying is "blueprinting." First, the drawing is drawn on semi-transparent tracing paper, with a ferric salt-sensitized paper underneath. It is placed in a glass frame and exposed to sunlight for two to twenty minutes. After that, the sensitized paper is taken out and washed in clean water, becoming a negative image drawing with blue background and white lines. Because the color of the drawing is blue, construction drawings are usually called "blueprints."
    Ferric salt-sensitized paper is generally manufactured by oneself. The method is very simple: use four parts of red prussiate of potash, five parts of ferric ammonium citrate, and add five to ten times the amount of water to mix them evenly, creating the sensitizing agent. Apply it to paper (use heavy-weight drawing paper of better quality that doesn’t dissolve in water), and it becomes sensitized paper. (When coating, it should be done under red light to prevent exposure.) Because ferric salt reduces to ferrous salt after exposure to light, it undergoes a chemical reaction with red prussiate of potash to create a blue precipitate, commonly known as Prussian blue. Where there are black lines, light cannot pass through, so it cannot be reduced, hence white lines appear. In this way, a drawing that exactly matches the size of the original is copied. This kind of sensitized paper can also be used to print photos. Because the negative of a photo is a negative image, the printed photo is a positive image. If the exposure is appropriate, the printed photo is very clear and beautiful.
    The negative image with a blue background and white lines has a disadvantage in use. If you want to modify or annotate text on the drawing, it is not very clear. This requires us to copy positive image drawings to make up for this shortcoming. How to print a positive image blueprint? The method is very simple, just first use a thinner piece of paper, coat it with the sensitizing solution, and print it into a negative image blueprint, exposing it a bit longer; then coat this negative image blueprint with a layer of vegetable oil to make it a semi-transparent drawing. Use this drawing to replace the first drawn semi-transparent original drawing for printing, and you can print a positive image blueprint with a white background and blue lines.
    Using ferric salt-sensitized paper for blueprinting requires a water washing process, and it takes a lot of time to copy a drawing, which cannot meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation. Therefore, most engineering projects now use diazo-sensitized paper (i.e., ammonia-developed paper) for copying drawings. After exposing the ammonia-developed paper under the original drawing, it doesn’t need to be washed with water. Put it into a wooden developing box with a bowl of ammonia water at the bottom. The ammonia water releases ammonia gas (i.e., ammonia) after heating. The drawing is exposed to ammonia gas, and a positive image purple-line drawing is obtained. In the current hot weather, ammonia water does not need to be heated and can evaporate on its own. Developing a drawing takes only a few minutes. Although this kind of drawing is not as clear and beautiful as a blueprint, and it fades easily, it is becoming a trend to replace blueprints because it is easy to develop and produces drawings quickly. This kind of drawing has a light purple background, with dark purple lines, but according to habit, we still call it a blueprint.

    怎样制“蓝图”？
    泥工
    我们常在报上看到“建设蓝图”这几个字，什么叫蓝图呢？
    通常造房子，或是造机器，都要根据工程技术人员画好的图样进行操作。图样上画有建筑物、机器和它的构件的式样，注有详细的尺寸。如果建筑物或机器构造比较复杂，各种构件需要分工进行操作，同一张图样就需要好几份。比如造房子，有的在现场操作，有的在车间预制，泥工、木工、钢筋工……等有关的工种都要图纸，材料部门要根据图纸准备材料，布置现场，施工人员要按照图纸指导操作；建设单位也要图纸，并要分送有关单位审查。因此同样的图纸，需要复制好几份。复制的方法，普通都用“蓝晒”。先把图样画在半透明的描图纸上，底下放一张铁盐感光纸，放在玻璃框子里，在太阳光下曝晒二至二十分钟后，把感光纸抽出来放在清水里漂洗，就成为蓝底白线的负像图纸。因为图纸的颜色是蓝的，因此习惯上就把工程图纸叫做“蓝图”。
    铁盐感光纸一般都是自己制造。方法很简便：用赤血盐四份，柠檬酸铁铵五份，加五到十倍清水拌匀，配成感光剂，把它涂刷在纸上（用纸质较好见水不化的重磅道林纸），即成为感光纸。（涂刷的时候，应在红色的灯光下进行，不使曝光。）因为铁盐见了光线后还原成亚铁盐，与赤血盐发生化学作用后起蓝色沉淀，即普通所谓普鲁士蓝。有黑线的地方因为透不过光线，不能还原，因此出现了白色的线条。这样就复制成和原图尺寸完全相符的图纸。用这种感光纸还可以晒照片，因为照片的底片是负像的，因此晒出来的照片是正像，如果曝光适宜，晒出的照片很清楚、好看。
    蓝底白线的负像图，在使用上有个缺点，如果要在图纸上修改或批注文字，就不大看得清楚，这就要求我们复制正像的图纸来弥补这个缺点。怎样晒正像蓝图呢？方法很简便，只要先用一张较薄的纸，涂上感光液，把它晒成一张负像蓝图，晒得深一些；然后在这张负像蓝图上涂上一层植物油，使成为半透明的图纸，用这张图纸来代替第一次画成的半透明的底图来晒图，就能晒成白底蓝线的正像蓝图。
    使用铁盐感光纸晒图，都需要经过水洗的手续，复制成一张图纸，需要很多时间，不能适应跃进形势的需要。因此现在工程上复制图纸，大多改用重氮感光纸（即熏图纸）。用熏图纸在底图下曝晒感光后，不用水洗，把它放进一只木制的熏图箱里，底下放一碗氨水，氨水加热后放出氨气（即阿莫尼亚），图纸经氨气一熏，即得正像紫线图纸。像目前天气热，氨水不需加热，即能蒸发，熏制一张图纸，只要几分钟就行了。这种图纸虽然没有像蓝图那样清楚美丽，而且容易褪色，但由于熏制简便，出图迅速，因此已有代替蓝图的趋势。这种图纸带有浅紫色，线条呈深紫色，不过我们根据习惯，还是叫它做蓝图。
