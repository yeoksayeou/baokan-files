On the Construction Site of a Blast Furnace
By our correspondents Chen Quanbi and Cui Yongchang

1958 is an unusual year for the Soviet steel industry. In order to expand steel production, the Soviet Union will build seven large-scale blast furnaces within this year and start producing iron by the end of the year. Such a large and rapid construction work vividly and powerfully demonstrates the great ambition of the Soviet Union in developing heavy industry.

Of the seven blast furnaces, besides two in Chelyabinsk and Novotroitsk in the Russian Federation, the other five are all in Ukraine. Their distribution is as follows: two in Zhdanov, one in Yenakiyevo in the Donbas, one in Dnepropetrovsk, and one in Krivoy Rog. The Krivoy Rog blast furnace is the largest, with a volume of 1,719 cubic meters, and can produce about 900,000 tons of iron annually after completion.

The construction of the seven blast furnaces has received enthusiastic support from the people of the Soviet Union, and the construction speed is unprecedented. Now that the builders of the seven blast furnaces have launched a socialist labor competition, none of them are lagging behind the plan. In the first quarter of the competition, the Komsomol No. 3 Blast Furnace in Dnepropetrovsk took the lead, and they put forward a resounding slogan: "Guarantee the completion of the blast furnace on August 10 and iron production on September 1."

Not long ago, we came to the Petrovsky Iron and Steel Plant in Dnepropetrovsk, where the blast furnace is being built. This factory is one of the oldest iron and steel plants in the Soviet Union and celebrated its 75th anniversary last year. Walking into the factory gate, we immediately felt an atmosphere of intense labor. Comrade Bashko, the deputy chief engineer in charge of blast furnace construction, introduced us to the construction of the blast furnace.

The Petrovsky Iron and Steel Plant currently has four blast furnaces. The new blast furnace is being built on the site of the old No. 3 blast furnace, so it is now called the Komsomol No. 3 Blast Furnace. Huge preparations were made before the construction of this new furnace. From December last year to January this year, 1,500 tons of cables were installed, new gas and water pipes were installed, and new railways were laid for transporting ore to the existing blast furnaces.

On February 15 this year, the construction of the blast furnace officially began. The volume of this blast furnace is 1,033 cubic meters, and the height from the ground is 72 meters. After completion, it can produce 1,500 tons of iron per day and night. All the equipment on the blast furnace is mechanized, and all measuring instruments are automated. To build this blast furnace, 7,500 tons of metal parts, 4,500 cubic meters of reinforced concrete parts, and more than 12,000 tons of refractory bricks are needed. According to the original plan, this large project should be completed on September 15 this year, that is, it should be completed in seven months. Such a speed is already rare in the world, but the Soviet workers now guarantee to hand it over a month in advance. How can such a heroic spirit not be admirable!

Comrade Bashko told us that the basic reason for the rapid construction of the blast furnace is the adoption of the rapid construction method. This construction method has several characteristics. First of all, all construction materials are large components. These components are manufactured by specialized factories and transported to the construction site, where they only need to be assembled. On the construction site, we saw large steel structure components that make up the furnace body, some of which weigh up to tens of tons. This method not only saves time but also reduces costs and improves quality. For assembly work, there are three large cranes on the construction site with lifting capacities of 25 to 30 tons.

The second characteristic of the rapid construction method is a high degree of division of labor and specialization. Twelve independent specialized construction companies participated in the construction of this blast furnace, such as the Dnepr Steel Component Installation Company, the Refractory Equipment Construction Company, the Ferrous Metallurgical Installation Company, the Electrical Equipment Installation Company, and the Sewer Installation Company. Each of the twelve specialized companies has its own experts and experienced technicians. Because they are familiar with the business, the quality of work can be greatly improved. In order to unify deployment, an engineering department was specially formed on the construction site to lead the overall construction.

The third characteristic of the rapid construction method is a high degree of mechanization of work. For example, the transportation of refractory bricks is carried out by a non-stop conveyor belt that can send refractory bricks to any place where they are needed. The hub of the transportation is concentrated in a small dispatch room, where a young girl uses a telephone switchboard to direct the supply of refractory bricks.

After Comrade Bashko introduced us to the rapid construction method, he said: "The rapid construction method is indeed an important reason for our achievements, but the decisive factor is still the people who build the blast furnace! If we do not have these people on our construction site who are not afraid of difficulties and work selflessly, any advanced method will be useless."

We had heard many stories about the unparalleled enthusiasm and heroic deeds of the blast furnace construction workers before we arrived at the factory. Take the foundation work when the blast furnace started construction as an example. This foundation is 4.5 meters deep and requires 2,000 cubic meters of concrete to be poured, which was originally planned to be completed in 120 hours. But when the work began, it suddenly started to drizzle, and then the drizzle turned into snow. Such weather undoubtedly hindered the normal progress of the work. However, the Komsomol Youth Production Team led by Comrades Osipov and Minenko took the lead and fought against the bad weather, overfulfilling the work quota by 200%. The work team responsible for mixing concrete then put forward the slogan "Guarantee as much as is needed." As a result, the blast furnace foundation was completed in only 50 hours! After this work was completed, the workers completed the foundation work of the three hot blast stoves at the same speed, twice as fast as originally planned.

Almost all work teams overfulfilled their work quotas, generally reaching 130%-140%. The phenomenon of completing the work quota by 200% is not uncommon. On the red list on the construction site, we also saw an even larger number: overfulfilling the plan by 320%! This achievement was created by installation worker Shepiliov, who had participated in the construction of twelve large blast furnaces in various parts of the Soviet Union and had rich experience. He is now leading a work team to carry out installation work. Shepiliov is a Communist Party member and was awarded the Order of Lenin last year for his labor achievements.

The blast furnace is being built in this way by advanced people using advanced methods. On August 10, this new blast furnace will stand majestically in front of people, and on September 1, the first stream of molten iron from the new furnace will spurt out with dazzling light, adding new strength to the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union.

    在高炉建设的工地上
    本报记者　陈泉璧　崔永昌
    1958年对苏联钢铁工业来说是不平常的一年。为了扩大钢铁生产，苏联要在今年一年内修建七座规模巨大的高炉，并且要在年底开始出铁。这样庞大迅速的建设工作，鲜明而有力地说明了苏联在发展重工业方面的伟大气魄。
    七座高炉中，除去两座在俄罗斯联邦的车里雅宾斯克和诺沃特洛依斯克以外，其他五座全在乌克兰。它们分布的情况是：日丹诺夫两座，顿巴斯的耶拿基也沃一座，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克一座和克里沃依罗格一座。克里沃依罗格的高炉是最大的一个，它的容积是一千七百一十九立方公尺，建成以后每年可以出铁九十万吨左右。
    七座高炉的建设工作得到了苏联全国人民的热情支持，建设速度是空前的。现在七座高炉的建设者展开了社会主义劳动竞赛后，没有一座不是走在计划前面。在第一季度的竞赛中，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的共青团三号高炉名列前茅，他们并提出了响亮的口号：“保证高炉在8月10日完工，9月1日出铁。”
    不久前，我们来到了第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克建设高炉的工厂——彼得罗夫斯基钢铁厂。这个工厂是苏联最老的钢铁厂之一，去年庆祝了建厂七十五周年。走进工厂的大门，我们立刻就感到一种紧张劳动的气氛。负责高炉建设的副总工程师巴什科同志向我们介绍了高炉的建设情况。
    彼得罗夫斯基钢铁厂现有四座高炉，新高炉是在过去三号高炉的旧址上建设的，因此它现在被称为共青团三号高炉。这座新炉在动工之前进行了巨大的准备工作，从去年12月到今年1月，安装了一千五百吨电缆，装起了新的煤气管和水管，铺设了给现有高炉运送矿砂的新铁道。
    今年2月15日，高炉的建设工作正式开始。这座高炉的容积是一千零三十三立方公尺，距地面的高度是七十二公尺，建成以后每昼夜可以出铁一千五百吨。高炉上的一切设备全部是机械化的，测量仪器全部是自动化的。为了建设这座高炉，需要用七千五百吨金属部件，四千五百立方公尺钢筋混凝土部件，耐火砖的数量将达到一万二千吨以上。这样一项大工程，按照原来计划，应当在今年9月15日完成，也就是说要在七个月的时间内建成。这样的速度在世界上已是稀有的了，但是苏联工人现在又提出提前一个月交工的保证，这种豪迈的英雄气概怎能不令人钦佩呢！
    巴什科同志告诉我们，高炉建设速度这样快的基本原因是因为采用了快速建设法。这种建设法有几个特点。首先，建设材料全部采用大型部件。这些部件由专门工厂制造好了以后，运到工地，只要装配起来就可以了。在工地上我们看到了组成炉身的钢结构大型部件，它们的重量大的可达十几吨。用这种方法不但节省时间，并且还可降低成本、提高质量。为了进行装配工作，工地上有三个大型的起重机，它们的起重能力达到二十五吨到三十吨。
    快速建设法的第二个特点是高度的分工与专业化。参加这座高炉建设的有十二个独立的专业化建筑公司，例如第聂伯钢铁部件安装公司，耐火设备建筑公司，黑色冶金安装公司，电气设备安装公司，下水道安装公司等。十二个专业公司个个有自己的专家和经验丰富的技术人员，因为业务熟悉，工作质量可以大大提高。为了统一调配，在工地上专门组成了领导全面施工的工程部。
    快速建设法的第三个特点是工作的高度机械化。例如耐火砖的运送工作，由一个运转不停的传送带可以把耐火砖送到任何一个需要的地方去，传送的枢纽集中在一个小小的调度室里，这里有一位年轻的姑娘利用电话调度机指挥着耐火砖的供应工作。
    巴什科同志向我们介绍完快速建设法以后说：“快速建设法的确是我们取得成绩的重要原因，但是起决定性作用的因素还是建设高炉的人！如果我们工地上没有这些不怕困难、忘我劳动的人，任何先进方法也没有用。”
    高炉建设工人们的无比干劲和英雄事迹，我们在未到工厂之前就已听到了很多。就以高炉开始建设时打地基的工作为例吧。这个地基深达四公尺五十公分，需要浇混凝土两千立方公尺，原来计划用一百二十小时完成。但是当工作开始的时候，忽然下起小雨，后来小雨又变成了雪，这样的天气无疑地妨碍了工作的正常进度。但是奥赛波夫和米宁科等同志率领的共青团青年生产队一马当先，同坏天气斗争，超额完成工作定额200％，负责搅拌混凝土的工作队随着提出了“要多少保证多少”的口号，结果高炉地基只用了五十小时就全部完成了！这项工作结束后，工人们又以同样的速度，比原计划快一倍地完成了三个热风炉的地基工作。
    差不多所有的工作队都超额完成工作定额，一般都达到130％—140％，完成工作定额200％的现象也并不稀奇。在工地的红榜上，我们还看到了一个更大的数字：超额完成计划320％！这项成绩是安装工人谢皮利奥夫创造的，他曾经参加过苏联各地十二个大型高炉的建设工作，经验丰富，现在领导着一个工作队进行安装工作。谢皮利奥夫是一个共产党员，去年因为劳动功绩荣获了列宁勋章。
    高炉就是这样被先进的人们用先进的方法建设着。8月10日，这个新的高炉就将巍然地出现在人们面前，而到9月1日，新炉的第一股铁水就将带着耀眼的光芒喷射出来，它将为苏联的和平建设增加新的力量。
