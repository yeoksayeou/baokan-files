　　New Style of New Peasants
　　Nancun
    The news of Huangjing Township, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, transplanting large seedlings to replace small seedlings on 700 mu of cotton fields is moving and inspiring. From this news, we see the new style of peasants daring to think, daring to act, and daring to fight to the end with Heaven; we also see the great and noble communist spirit of the peasants.
    To create a high-yield record of 2,000 jin of cotton per mu on such a large area of 700 mu, some people may regard it as just a beautiful dream. However, the peasants of Huangjing Township are determined to turn this dream into reality. They continuously fought against overcast rain, cold waves, and hail. After four replantings and rush plantings, the cotton seedlings still grew unevenly, and the season was late. Some people may think that they have done their best, their utmost effort, right? What other way is there to think of? However, they were not reconciled, and with the encouragement and support of the Party organization, they tried every means and finally came up with a way to ask for support from various townships to replace small seedlings with large seedlings. They knew that the strength of one township could not defeat Heaven, but the strength of several townships could. If it weren't for people with the new style of communism, who would dare to imagine this? Under the call of the Mianyang County Party Committee, farmers, cadres, and residents from Xiantao Town, Chungkouchu District, and even Batan Township, 50 li away from Huangjing Township, came in thousands in less than a day to support them. They came carrying cotton seedlings and nutrient pots in gift boxes, vegetable baskets, bamboo baskets, and whatever they could find. They came with shovels and hoes on their backs. They wanted to work together with the farmers of Huangjing Township for five days and five nights to make the 700 mu of uneven cotton seedlings neat and strong. Farmers and residents from various districts and townships may not have known the farmers of Huangjing Township before. However, for a common ideal—to create a large-area high-yield of cotton, they were as anxious and acted as quickly as if it were their own business! How can their communist spirit of cooperation not be moving!
    In the past, when people mentioned peasants, they inevitably had concepts such as conservatism, backwardness, freedom, looseness, selfishness, and self-interest in their minds. After cooperativization, many people still could not change this concept. Precisely because of maintaining this concept of peasants, many people have pessimistic estimates about the future of our country's agriculture, do not believe that agriculture can develop rapidly, and do not believe that the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical can be implemented. They don't know that the peasants who have been liberated from small private relations of production can no longer be viewed with old eyes. Today's peasants are already able to control their own destiny. They can do things like one person with thousands or tens of thousands of people, and do many earth-shattering undertakings that people did not dare to think about in the past. Countless facts that have emerged in the production upsurge since last winter illustrate this point, and the cotton planting in Huangjing Township illustrates this point once again.
    Attaching importance to peasants and relying on peasants is our Party's consistent and unwavering revolutionary policy. The recently held Eighth National Congress Second Session once again admonished us to be good at relying on the strength of the great alliance of more than 500 million peasants. People who are still looking at today's new peasants with old eyes should learn another lesson from the facts in Huangjing Township.

　　新农民的新风格
　　南村
    湖北沔阳县黄荆乡在七百亩棉田上移大苗换小苗的消息，是一则令人感动和鼓舞的消息。从这条消息里，我们看到了农民敢想、敢干、敢于同天老爷斗争到底的新风格；也看到了农民伟大崇高的共产主义精神。
    要在七百亩这样大的土地面积上创造亩产棉花两千斤的高额丰产纪录，这在有些人看来，不过是一个美丽的梦想罢了。黄荆乡的农民却硬要把这个梦想变成现实。他们连续向阴雨、寒潮、冰雹作斗争。经过四次补苗和赶种，棉苗还是生长不齐，而节令也晚了。这在有些人看来，也算是尽了人事，尽了最大的努力了吧，还有什么办法可想呢？可是，他们并不甘休，在党组织的鼓励和支持下，他们又想尽千方百计，终于想出要求各乡支援，以大苗换小苗的办法。他们知道，一个乡的力量不能战胜天，几个乡的力量就能战胜天。要不是有共产主义的新风格的人，谁敢这样设想呢？在黄荆乡附近的仙桃镇、埫口区以至远离黄荆乡五十里的八潭乡的农民、干部和居民，在沔阳县委的一声号召之下，不到一天，就开来了几千人的支援大军。他们用礼盒、用菜篮、用箩筐、用随便什么手边拿得到的东西装着棉苗、装着营养钵，他们背着锹、背着锄头赶来了。他们要和黄荆乡的农民一起，奋战五天五夜，把七百亩参差不齐的棉苗变得又整齐又茁壮。来自各区、乡的农民和居民，和黄荆乡的农民平日也许并不认识。可是，为了一个共同的理想——创造棉花大面积高额丰产，他们像对待自己的事情一样，心情那么焦急，行动那么迅速！他们这种共产主义的协作精神，怎不令人感动！
    过去，一提起农民，人们的头脑里总不免要浮现出保守落后、自由散漫、自私自利等概念。合作化以后，许多人也还改变不了这种概念。正是由于对农民仍然保持这种概念，所以许多人对我国农业的前途产生了悲观的估计，不相信农业可以用很快的速度向前发展，不相信多快好省的方针可以贯彻执行。他们不知道，从小私有的生产关系解放出来的农民，已经不能拿旧的眼光看待了。今天的农民，他们已经能够掌握自己的命运。他们可以几千人几万人像一个人一样地干，干出人们过去想也不敢想的许多惊天动地的大事业。去冬以来的生产高潮中出现的无数事实说明了这一点，黄荆乡种棉的事实又一次说明了这一点。
    重视农民，依靠农民，这是我们党一贯的坚定不移的革命方针。最近召开的八大二次会议又告诫我们，要善于依靠五亿多农民这一伟大同盟军的力量。还在用老眼光看今天的新农民的人们，应该从黄荆乡的事实中再一次吸取教训。
