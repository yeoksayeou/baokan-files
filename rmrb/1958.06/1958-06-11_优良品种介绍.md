Introduction to Superior Varieties

“Victory Rapeseed” is currently one of the best superior rapeseed varieties. The yield increase effect of this variety is even more pronounced this year. In Songzi County, Hubei Province, more than 30,000 mu of "Victory Rapeseed" yielded an average of 270 jin per mu, an increase of 145% compared to local varieties.

Strong disease resistance, high yield with fertilizer tolerance, and relatively cold resistance are all excellent characteristics of "Victory Rapeseed." This variety is currently suitable for cultivation in areas with two crops a year, abundant fertilizer sources, and severe diseases.

"Xishui Rapeseed White" is a superior variety cultivated by Li Wencheng, a model agricultural laborer in Xishui County, Hubei Province. The main characteristics of this variety are: high yield, short growth period, and early maturity, making it suitable for promotion in double-cropping rice areas. "Xishui Rapeseed White" seedlings grow quickly, have well-developed root systems, and are cold-resistant, allowing them to overwinter safely even when sown slightly late. This variety has high resistance to mosaic virus, but it is not resistant to downy mildew.

"Echeng White Rapeseed" is a local superior variety in Echeng County, Hubei Province. It has a short growth period, early maturity, and high yield, making it an excellent variety for cultivation in double-cropping rice areas. In Echeng, the general growth period is about 181 days, and it can be harvested before "Lixia" (Beginning of Summer). After the rapeseed harvest, early rice seedlings can be transplanted completely.

Echeng White Rapeseed has strong disease resistance, small branching angle, and is suitable for dense planting. This variety has a strong spring habit, so do not sow it too early.

"Dongkou Sweet Rapeseed" is a superior local variety in Dongkou, Hunan Province. It has early maturity and high yield characteristics, making it suitable for cultivation in double-cropping rice areas. This variety grows quickly in winter, accumulates a lot of nutrients during the seedling stage, has strong growth potential, and does not bolt and flower before winter. Its characteristics also include strong cold resistance and low susceptibility to rapeseed sclerotinia and downy mildew.

"Gongzhen Bridge Long-Pod Rapeseed" was originally a farmer's variety collected in rural Zhejiang. After being introduced and tested by the Luxian Experimental Station in Sichuan, it was promoted in the southern Sichuan area.

The main advantages of "Gongzhen Bridge Long-Pod Rapeseed" are its short growth period, early maturity, and high yield. In southern Sichuan, the entire growth period is 140 to 150 days, about one to two months earlier than "Victory Rapeseed."

This variety requires less fertilizer and can produce a certain yield even when cultivated on relatively barren land. Its highest yield per mu can reach more than 280 jin.

"Cinnabar Red" is a local variety in Wenjiang County, Sichuan, suitable for late sowing and early maturity, making it extremely suitable for cultivation in double-cropping rice areas. The results of trial planting of this variety in Guangdong are good, and promotion has begun. "Cinnabar Red" seedlings grow rapidly, have a short seedling stage, small leaves, and short plants; its disease resistance is weak, but its cold resistance is strong.

"Xinghua Rapeseed" is a local superior variety in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province. It is a hybrid variety cultivated by the masses in Duotian Township of the county using "Qingyang Ertou" and "Piao'er Bai." The main advantage of "Xinghua Rapeseed" is its strong cold resistance; it rarely freezes to death even under low temperatures of minus five to seven degrees Celsius. "Xinghua Rapeseed" rarely shows signs of damage from mosaic virus and sclerotinia.

This type of rapeseed has thick and well-developed roots and stems, many effective branches, dense pods, tightly arranged seeds, low unfilled seed rate, and plump seeds. Due to the above advantages, it has a high and stable yield, generally 180 to 200 jin per mu.

    优良品种介绍
    “胜利油菜”是目前最好的油菜优良品种之一。这个品种的增产效果，今年更突出了。湖北省松滋县今年三万多亩“胜利油菜”，平均亩产二百七十多斤，比地方品种增产145％。
    抗病力强、高产耐肥、比较耐寒，都是“胜利油菜”的优良特性。这个品种目前适宜在一年两熟和肥源充足以及病害严重的地区栽培。
    “浠水油菜白”是湖北省浠水县农业劳动模范李文成培育的优良品种。这个品种的主要特点是：产量高、生长期短、早熟，可在双季稻区推广。“浠水油菜白”幼苗生长快，根系发达，耐寒力强，在稍晚播种情况下也能安全越冬。这个品种对毒素病有较高的抗病力，但不抗霜霉病。
    “鄂城白油菜”是湖北省鄂城县地方良种。生长期短，早熟丰产，是双季稻区栽培的一个优良品种。在鄂城一般生育期一百八十一天左右，“立夏”前可收获。油菜收获后，完全可以移栽早稻秧苗。
    鄂城白油菜抗病力较强，分枝角度小，宜于密植。这个品种春性较强，不要播种过早。
    “洞口甜油菜”是湖南省洞口优良地方品种。具有早熟丰产特性，适于双季稻区栽培。这个品种冬季生长快，苗期积累养分多，生长势强，冬前不抽苔开花。抗寒力较强，对油菜菌核病、霜霉病受害率均低，也是它的特点。
    “拱震桥长荚油菜”原是浙江农村所征集的农家品种，经四川泸县试验站引种后，在川南地区推广。
    “拱震桥长荚油菜”主要优点是生长期短，早熟丰产。在川南整个生育期一百四、五十天，约比“胜利油菜”早熟一到两个月。
    这个品种需肥量较少，在比较瘠薄地栽培下，也有一定产量。它的最高亩产量可达二百八十多斤。
    “朱砂红”是四川温江县地方品种，宜于迟播，又能早熟，极适合于双季稻区栽培。这个品种在广东试种结果良好，已开始推广。“朱砂红”幼苗生长迅速，苗期短，叶片小，植株矮；抗病力较弱；但耐寒力较强。
    “兴化油菜”是江苏省兴化县的地方良种，是这个县垛田乡群众用“青羊耳头”“飘儿白”培育的杂交种。“兴化油菜”主要优点是抗寒性强，在摄氏零下五到七度低温条件下，很少有冻死现象。“兴化油菜”很少发现有毒素病、菌核病的为害。
    这种油菜根茎粗壮发达，有效分枝多，结荚密，籽粒排列紧，不实率低，子粒饱满充实。由于它具备以上优点，因此产量高而稳定，一般亩产一百八十斤到二百斤。
