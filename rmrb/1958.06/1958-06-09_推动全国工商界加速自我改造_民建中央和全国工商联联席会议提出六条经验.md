Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a joint (expanded) meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the 6th and 7th, focusing on discussing how to further promote the acceleration of the self-remolding of the national industrial and commercial circles under the illumination of the general line of socialist construction.

After listening to the reports of the working groups dispatched by the two associations to various places to inspect the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles, the meeting analyzed and studied the current political and ideological conditions of the industrial and commercial circles. The meeting held that the general situation of the political division of the industrialists and businessmen is: The ranks of the leftists have been expanded and improved compared with the past, but they still need to continue self-remolding and improvement; the majority of the middle elements have begun to transform to the left to varying degrees through the movement, but they are still in the middle transition state and still have two-sidedness in politics. There are also a few people whose capitalist stance has not changed much. They are out of tune with the new society and even have strong resistance to the rectification movement. These situations show that the political and ideological remolding of the industrial and commercial circles is a long-term and complex education and struggle process. At present, it is necessary to combine the study of the general line of socialist construction, implement the spirit of the general line into the rectification movement of the industrial and commercial circles, and mobilize the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to continue to go all out, aim high, and accelerate self-remolding.

The meeting believed that, judging from the situation in various places in the previous stage, the following experiences should be absorbed in order to continue to carry out this movement in depth:

One, accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the key to the victory of the movement. The self-remolding movement of the industrial and commercial circles has been carried out under the leadership, care and support of the Party from the beginning to the present. In the future, we must still actively strive for the leadership of the Party, correctly accept the Party's policies, policies and instructions, and earnestly implement them.

Two, carry out situation education, policy education and various visualized educations to inspire the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen for self-remolding.

Three, earnestly implement the mass line, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in the industrial and commercial circles.

Four, the leadership takes the lead, the backbone goes first, cultivates typical examples, and mobilizes family members.

Five, combine the acceleration of self-remolding with practical actions such as participating in physical labor and actively contributing technical talents. Through labor and production practice, industrialists and businessmen can personally experience the glory of labor and the shame of exploitation, and feel the necessity and importance of their own thorough transformation. This can make the rectification movement develop faster and better.

Six, apply the principles and methods of socialist competition to political stance and ideological remolding. Through this socialist self-remolding competition, set up advanced models, drive the backward, make the backward catch up with the advanced, and make the advanced even more advanced. After the industrialists and businessmen from seven provinces and eight cities signed the "five comparisons" competition agreement at the on-site meeting held by the two associations in Tianjin in mid-April, it has promoted the development of national evaluation and competition. In order to implement the initiative of that meeting and do a good job in the evaluation and competition work, the meeting decided to hold a national evaluation meeting in the third quarter, requiring all regions to hold the evaluation meeting in their own region before the national evaluation, elect advanced units, exchange advanced experiences, and promote them in a timely manner to promote the development of the movement. The meeting also decided to hold a self-remolding exhibition at the same time as the two associations hold a national evaluation meeting, so as to consolidate the achievements of the ideological great leap forward through visualized education, and at the same time promote the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to further accept remolding and contribute their strength to the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

　　推动全国工商界加速自我改造
    民建中央和全国工商联联席会议提出六条经验
    新华社7日讯　中国民主建国会和全国工商联6、7两日举行中央常务委员联席（扩大）会议，着重讨论在社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，如何进一步推动全国工商界加速进行自我改造问题。
    会议在听取了两会派赴各地视察工商界整风运动情况的工作组汇报以后，对目前工商界政治思想状况作了分析研究，会议认为目前工商业者的政治分野大体情况是：左派分子的队伍比以前有了扩大和提高，但是还需要继续自我改造和提高；多数中间分子通过运动开始不同程度地向左转化，但还处在中间过渡状态中，在政治上仍然具有两面性。还有少数人资本主义立场还没有什么改变，他们对新社会格格不入，甚至对整风运动有强烈的抵触情绪。这些情况说明工商界的政治思想改造是一个长期复杂的教育和斗争过程，目前必须结合对社会主义建设总路线的学习，把总路线的精神贯彻到工商界的整风运动中去，动员广大工商业者继续鼓足干劲、力争上游加速自我改造。
    会议认为，从前一阶段各地的情况看来，今后要继续深入开展这一运动应该吸收以下的经验：
    一、接受中国共产党的领导是运动取得胜利的关键。工商界的自我改造运动从开始到现在，一直是在党的领导、关怀与支持下进行的。今后仍然必须积极争取党的领导，正确地接受党的方针、政策和指示，并认真地加以贯彻。
    二、进行形势教育、政策教育和各种形象化教育，启发工商业者自我改造的积极性。
    三、认真贯彻群众路线，发挥工商界群众的积极性和创造性。
    四、领导带头、骨干先行、培养典型、动员家属。
    五、把加速自我改造同参加体力劳动、积极贡献技术才能等实际行动结合起来，通过劳动和生产实践，使工商业者亲身体会到劳动的光荣和剥削可耻，感到自己有脱胎换骨地进行本质改造的必要性和重要性，这样就可以使整风运动开展得更快更好。
    六、把社会主义竞赛的原则和方法运用到政治立场和思想改造中来。通过这种社会主义自我改造的竞赛，树立先进榜样，带动落后，使落后的赶上先进，先进的更先进。两会4月中旬在天津召开的现场会议上，七省八市的工商业者签订“五比”竞赛协议书后，已经推动了全国评比竞赛的开展。为了贯彻实现那次会议的倡议，把评比竞赛工作做好，这次会议决定在第三季度召开全国性评比会议，要求各地在全国性评比以前，先开本地区的评比会议，推选先进单位，交流先进经验，及时推广，以促进运动的发展。会议还决定在两会召开全国性评比会议的同时，举办一个自我改造展览会，以便通过形象化教育，巩固思想大跃进的成果，同时推动广大工商业者进一步接受改造，并在技术革命和文化革命中贡献自己的力量。
