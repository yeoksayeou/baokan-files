　　Let's Shorten the Commodity Circulation Route Even Further
　　In the past, the commercial departments had a saying to describe the slow circulation of commodities: "Pigs die, eggs stink, and fruits rot." This meant that there were too many links in the commodity circulation process, with goods being transferred and allocated in various directions, causing many fresh commodities to rot, stink, and die. This "commodity travel" method, involving circuitous routes, high transportation costs, and wasted time, was detrimental to promoting production and ensuring supply. Everyone felt that this system needed reform.
　　Now, the commercial departments of Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province have taken the lead. They have eliminated unnecessary circulation links in the commodity circulation system, adopting direct transportation to ensure that commodities reach consumers from producers in the shortest time, along the shortest route, and at the lowest cost. This not only saves commodity circulation expenses but also better serves the production departments and consumers.
　　We hope that the experience of the commercial departments of Tangshan Prefecture can be promoted so that our industrial products and agricultural and sideline products can circulate faster between cities, between urban and rural areas, and between industry and commerce and industry and agriculture, helping to achieve greater leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production.

### 让商品流转的路短些再短些

    让商品流转的路短些再短些
    过去，商业部门有句形容商品流转太慢的话：“猪死、蛋臭、水果烂”。意思是商品流转的环节太多，东转西拨，许多鲜活的商品都烂了、臭了、死了。这种“商品旅行”的办法，路绕得多、运费花得多、时间费得多，对促进生产、保证供应有弊无利。大家都感到这种制度要改革。
    现在，河北唐山专区的商业部门作了先锋。他们在商品流转制度上去掉了多余的流转环节，采用直线运输，让商品以最短的时间，走最短的路线、花最少的钱、从生产者手里运到消费者手里。这样既节省了商品流转费用，又能够更好地为生产部门、为消费者服务。
    我们希望唐山专区商业部门的经验能够得到推广，使我们的工业品、农副产品在城城、城乡、工商、工农之间更快地流转，帮助工农业生产更大的跃进。
