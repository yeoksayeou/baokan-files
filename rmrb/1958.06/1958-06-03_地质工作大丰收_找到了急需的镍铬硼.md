Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: In recent years, the mineral raw material bases for nickel, chromium, boron, potassium, and other minerals, which were most lacking for the development of China's metallurgical and chemical industries, have been found one after another this year. Currently, the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have dispatched strong geological teams to intensify exploration, preparing to provide sufficient reserves for exploitable design within this year alone.

　　The discovery of the large nickel mine in Yunnan is the biggest success of China's geological work this year. This nickel mine is found in ultramafic rocks most suitable for mineralization. The outcrop of the ore body alone is 300 kilometers long, and the mining area is close to the highway, with very convenient transportation. Currently, the exploration team of the Ministry of Geology is working at two locations. They plan to submit reserves to the country this year that will be many times greater than the total nickel reserves submitted nationwide during the First Five-Year Plan period.

　　The newly discovered chromium mine in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reserves many times larger than the chromium mine found in Qinghai Province in 1956, and its grade is very high. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to develop this mining area ahead of schedule.

　　The boron and potassium mineral deposits found this year are all in Qinghai Province. Although geological personnel had encountered many soils and lake waters containing borax in this province in the past, finding rich borax deposits under the lake water as in February was a first. They drilled sixteen holes through the lake water with drilling rigs, and fourteen of them encountered borax, making it highly valuable for exploitation. Relevant departments have organized a large force to go there for mining.

　　Potash salt is mainly stored in many salt lakes in the Qaidam Basin. It is estimated that the potash salt reserves in Charkhan Lake alone are more than 200 million tons, and refining is not difficult.

### 地质工作大丰收  找到了急需的镍铬硼

　　地质工作大丰收
    找到了急需的镍铬硼
    据新华社2日讯  几年来我国发展冶金工业和化学工业最感缺乏的镍、铬、硼、钾等矿物原料基地，今年都已先后找到。现在，地质部和冶金工业部都已派出强大的地质队伍加紧勘探，准备在今年一年内，就要提供可开采设计的足够储量。
    云南大镍矿的发现是今年以来我国地质工作最大的一次丰收。这个镍矿赋存在最适宜于成矿的超基性岩石中，光是矿层露头就长三百公里，矿区靠近公路，交通很方便。现在，地质部的勘探队正在两个地点进行工作。他们计划在今年内提交给国家的储量，就将比第一个五年计划期间全国提交的镍储量还多许多倍。
    在内蒙古自治区新发现的铬矿，储量比1956年在青海省找到的铬矿大好多倍。而且品位很高。冶金工业部已决定提前开发这个矿区。
    今年找到的硼和钾的矿产地都在青海省。地质人员过去在这个省虽然也遇到过很多含有硼砂的土质和湖水，但是像2月间那样在湖水下面找到丰富的硼砂矿藏却还是第一次。他们用钻机透过湖水打了十六个钻孔，有十四个钻孔都遇到了硼砂，因此开采价值很大。有关部门已经组织了很大力量前去开采。
    钾盐主要是蕴藏在柴达木盆地的许多盐湖中。据估计仅察尔汗湖内的钾盐储量就两亿多吨，而且提炼并不困难。
