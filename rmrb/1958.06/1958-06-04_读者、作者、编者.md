    Love to Read Articles by Party Committee Secretaries
    Recently, I often read articles written by Party committee secretaries from various places in the newspaper. It is a good phenomenon that Party committee secretaries are doing propaganda work, which can powerfully promote the great leap forward in various tasks. Party committee secretaries are the parties concerned and leaders in various localities, that is, organizers and leaders. They are familiar with the situation, understand the overall work, and have a high level of Marxism-Leninism, so the articles they write are "to the point" and can solve people's problems of understanding, thinking, and practice. We all like to read them.

    Many Benefits from Leadership Cadres Writing
    After reading the news "Guiyang Municipal Party Committee Organized City's Leadership Cadres to Summarize Experience and Write Articles" published in the People's Daily on April 21st, I think the Guiyang Municipal Party Committee's approach is very correct. There are many benefits for leading cadres to write articles and summarize experience themselves: First, implementing the Party's policies and guidelines is both rapid and timely. Second, in-depth investigation and research among the masses, and personally writing articles can overcome bureaucratic airs and stagnation; at the same time, it can avoid the rework phenomenon of relying on secretaries to write, which is in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Third, leading cadres doing this can set an example for general cadres.

    Dispelled Previous Concerns
    I was really excited and improved a lot ideologically after reading the article published on the third page on May 25th about the brilliant achievements made by Jiangxi Province's cadres sent to the countryside in the five months of their assignment.
    Thinking back to last year when the Party put forward the wise call for cadres to be sent down, although I had some theoretical understanding, knowing that this was the best shortcut for us to move towards being both red and expert, my understanding and comprehension of the great significance of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside was extremely insufficient. At that time, I always thought that doing so would be counterproductive and would forget my homework. After reading this report, I completely dispelled my previous concerns and wrong views. Facts have proved the wisdom and greatness of the Party's policies. It is truly "Man and nature change together, thought and production both reap a bumper harvest."

    Too Late
    The "In Schools" column on the second page of the May 18th issue published the news that our college held the second scientific lecture, specially inviting national labor model and rice expert Comrade Chen Yongkang to be the speaker. The matter is true, but the time is too long. This lecture was held on April 11th, and it was not reported until thirty-seven days later. Is it news? Or old news? Although this news is not very important, if it is to be reported, it should be timely.

    Regarding the Issue of Expanding the Page
    Recently, some readers have written to suggest that this newspaper expand the page size and use the center seam to publish advertisements, so as to publish more news and articles without increasing the number of pages.
    The spirit of the readers' suggestion is very good, and we express our gratitude. The page of this newspaper has been slightly enlarged since March. Due to the structure of the printing press, the current page cannot be enlarged any further. In order to save paper, we will also change the 62-inch wide roll paper used in the past to 61.5-inch wide roll paper. As for using the center seam, this is also impossible on a rotary printing press. The reason why a quarter-fold newspaper can use the center seam is because the two pages of this type of newspaper are only equivalent to one page of a broadsheet newspaper (such as this newspaper).
    Some readers have also suggested that all newspapers expand their pages. As far as we know, different newspapers use different printing presses, and this depends on the specific situation of the printing press.  Editor

    爱读党委书记们的文章
    最近，时常在报纸上读到各地党委书记写的文章。党委书记都来作宣传工作，这能有力地推动各项工作的大跃进，是个好现象。党委书记是各地工作的当事人，带头人，亦即组织者和领导者，他们熟悉情况，了解全盘工作，加上他们均有较高的马克思列宁主义水平，写出的文章“有的放矢”，能解决人们的认识问题、思想问题、作法问题。我们都喜欢看。

    领导干部动笔好处多
    读了4月21日人民日报登载的“贵阳市委组织全市领导干部总结经验写出文章”的消息，觉得贵阳市委的做法非常正确。领导干部亲自动手写文章总结经验有很多好处：第一、贯彻党的方针政策，既迅速又及时。第二、深入群众调查研究，亲自动笔写成文章，可以克服官气、暮气；同时可以避免靠秘书写的返工现象，合乎多快好省的原则。第三、领导干部这样做，可以给一般干部做出榜样。

    打消了以往的顾虑
    5月25日第三版刊登的江西省上山干部在下放五个月中所取得的辉煌成绩一文，我读了真感到兴奋，并且在思想上也提高了不少。
    想起去年党提出了干部下放的英明号召后，自己虽然在理论上有所认识，知道这是使我们奔向又红又专道路的最好捷径，但对上山下乡的伟大意义的体会和理解是极其不够的。当时总还以为这样做会得不偿失，把自己的功课都给忘了。看了这篇报道后，彻底打消了以往的顾虑和错误的看法。事实证明了党的政策的英明和伟大。真是“人和自然一齐变，思想生产双丰收”。

    太迟了
    5月18日二版“在学校里”一栏刊登了我院举行第二次科学讲座，特请全国劳动模范、水稻专家陈永康同志主讲的消息。事情是确实的，时间却隔得太久了。这个讲座是4月11日举行的，三十七天以后才报道，算新闻呢？还是旧闻？虽然这条消息不算十分重要，但是既要报道，总该及时些。

    关于扩大版面的问题
    近来有些读者来信，建议本报扩大版面编印面积，并利用中缝刊登广告，以便在不增加篇幅的情况下，更多地刊登消息和文章。
    读者建议的精神很好，我们表示感谢。本报版面从3月份起已经稍有放大，由于印报机器的构造关系，目前的版面不能再扩大了。为了节约纸张，我们并将过去用的六十二吋宽的卷纸改为六十一吋半宽的卷纸。至于利用中缝，这在轮转印报机上也是不可能的。四开报纸所以能够利用中缝，是因为这种报纸的两块版才相当于对开报纸（如本报）的一块版。
    有的读者还建议各种报纸都扩大版面。据我们了解，各报使用的印刷机不同，这要看印刷机的具体情况而定。  编者
