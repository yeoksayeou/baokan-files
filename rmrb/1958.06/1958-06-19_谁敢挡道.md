It is said that some people are currently whispering that the knowledge and techniques of Comrade Li Shimei, our country's termite expert, cannot be considered science, and so on. This whispering comes from the scientific community and boils down to a specific question: Can Li Shimei be a scientific researcher? Some are shouting: "Li Shimei can't be considered a scientific worker; at most, he's just a technician."

Before discussing this issue, let's first look at the comments of some well-known figures in the scientific community.

Chen Shixiang, Director of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Entomological Society, expressed many thoughts. He said that this "embodies the socialist road of science"; "is a model of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in scientific work"; "demonstrates the noble morality of a scientific worker"; "the research on termites has surpassed the international level"; "there is no more complete method for controlling termites than Li Shimei's method in any country"; and therefore, he also thought about "the importance of implementing the mass line in scientific work" and "the importance of whether scientific achievements can completely solve practical problems," and so on. This was said at the Beijing entomological community's welcome meeting for Li Shimei on May 21st and was published in the People's Daily on May 22nd. Also at this meeting, "during the discussion, entomologists and toxicologists pointed out that Li Shimei's methods and viewpoints are in line with the theories of entomology."

Zhu Hongfu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences, also published an article in Wenhui Bao, praising Li Shimei's "original ideas" that he "most admired," those things that "are not in termite books," and said that these "are extremely important for prevention and control." "He is good at judging the location of the main termite nest, which is the key to complete elimination."

There is no need to quote the same views of other scientists and professors. I am not advocating the worship of famous figures, but these discussions generally list facts as the basis, which can be believed. However, those whisperers, although proclaiming the high opinion that "that cannot be considered science," only the sound of barking is heard, but the basis is not even a shadow.

In fact, regardless of what the scientific community thinks, the masses have a very warm interest and discussion about this matter, and they have long been wondering: Twenty-one agricultural tool reformers and young farmer Wang Baojing have already been hired as specially invited researchers, so why hasn't Li Shimei been hired? Is it perhaps because the Institute of Entomology studies animals, so it is more advanced than those studying machinery and plants? Now, people cannot help but think that this is related to the "whispering." It seems that these "private discussions" currently have more power than public discussions and can temporarily block a talented scientific researcher from entering the research institution. So, who are these private discussers? What basis and insights do they have, and why don't they dare to stand up and talk about it publicly?

"Whispering" people probably always have something shameful, so they can only "whisper." But we want to discuss it extensively here:

First, since the "knowledge and techniques" of a person who "embodies the socialist road of science," has become "a model of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in scientific work," and whose "research has surpassed the international level" "cannot be considered science," then those who are now sitting on the scientific throne and "can be considered science" must be taking another "road," are another "model," and that "level" must be without originality, something that termite books already have. Can this be considered reasonable?

Second, one type of person is "unreservedly contributing knowledge and technology to the people," while another type of person is "whispering" on the sidelines, blocking the way. Since it is admitted that the former "demonstrates the noble morality of a scientific worker," then what the latter demonstrates is also very clear, isn't it?

Third, now that we want to follow the "mass line" and "emphasize whether scientific achievements can completely solve practical problems," then why is it that "there is no more complete method for controlling termites than Li Shimei's method in any country" "cannot be considered science"? Perhaps it is still "focusing on papers"? However, isn't Li Shimei's research "already surpassing the international level," and isn't "Li Shimei's report the best scientific paper"? How can this be explained?

It seems that the "whisperers" are not focusing on "papers" or "solving practical problems." They have only one focus: what is your background and what road are you taking. If you are not from a "formal" background, have not studied abroad, have not picked up some old and rotten lecture notes from a capitalist university, and have not taken the bourgeois road of science that is divorced from reality like them, then even if you have research results that "surpass the international level," have new discoveries that are not in the world's "termite books," and have complete prevention and control methods that no other country has, you still cannot be considered science. On the contrary, like termites that have蛀 through books and gnawed on a few pieces of foreign bread, as long as you can recite a few mysterious numbers and obscure formulas like a Taoist priest chanting spells, even if you have no originality, know nothing about practical prevention and control, or are even just a charlatan, you can still "be considered science," can firmly sit in the scientific institution, and can roll your eyes and block the road for others. This is truly "distinctly demarcated"!

From this, I thought of the "termite industry." According to Comrade Li Shimei, the termite merchants who "keep technical secrets and seek profit" once refused his request to learn termite prevention and control, and later, fourteen termite merchants jointly accused him of being "illegal" and wanted to "expel" him from the country. The merchants of the termite industry hated him so much because he exposed the mystery of so-called "technical secrets," turning it into a "vulgar" thing that everyone could master, cutting off the termite bosses' way to control high profits. Now, the role of "refusing" and "expelling" has been taken by the so-called scientists who can only whisper privately, saying "I already knew his technology." The reason, of course, is that Li Shimei dared to lift the veil used by those empty scientists to scare people, restored science to its original appearance, and is even able to speak, use, and is proficient in both literary and military skills. If this kind of person breaks into the scientific ranks and sits on the same bench, then, in contrast, those various "scientists": the "hoarders" who "speculate in commodities," the "delusional" who "sell dog skin plaster," and the "cheaters" who "buy and sell short" will all have to reveal their true colors. If they don't learn some real skills, they will be unable to sit firmly in their chairs. So, they have to desperately hold onto the door, not allowing people from worker and peasant backgrounds with rich practical experience to squeeze in.

Aren't the actions of these whispering "scientists" so similar to those of the termite merchants?

Thus, we clearly see the struggle between two roads. On one side are people wearing paper paste academic hats, desperately blocking the advance of the proletarian scientific army, trying to occupy the scientific institutions and fantasizing about becoming places for them to live in comfort. On the other side is the torrent of the working people, holding high the banner of true science, launching an attack on them, and wanting to make the scientific institutions forever a sacred fortress of the people's science. Fantasizing about hindering the advance of the proletarian scientific army can only lead to the ridiculous end of a mantis trying to stop a cart. Those who recognize the times naturally should make way!

    谁敢挡道
    葛德
    听说目前有些人在窃窃私议，说我国白蚁专家李始美同志的学识和技术不能算科学，等等。这窃窃私议，来自科学界，而且归结在一个具体问题上：李始美能不能当个科学研究员？有人叫嚷着：“李始美哪能算科学工作者，顶多当个技术员也就差不多”。
    在谈这个问题之前，不妨先看一下某些科学界名人的谈论。
    科学院昆虫研究所所长、昆虫学会理事长陈世骧发表了许多感想。说这是“体现了社会主义的科学道路”；“科学工作多快好省的范例”；“表现了一个科学工作者的高尚道德”；“对白蚁的研究已经超过了国际水平”，“现在各国还没有比李始美除治白蚁的方法更完善的方法”；因而还想到了“科学工作中贯彻群众路线的重要”和“应该重视科学成果是否能彻底解决实际问题”等等。这番话，是在5月21日北京昆虫学界欢迎李始美的会上说的，刊载在5月22日人民日报上。也是在这个会上，“讨论的时候，昆虫学家和毒理学家们指出，李始美的方法和观点是符合昆虫学的理论的。”
    科学院昆虫研究所副所长朱弘复也在文汇报上发表文章，赞扬了他“最称赞”的李始美的“创见”，即“白蚁书本上所没有的”那些东西，并说这些“都与防治有莫大关系”。“他善于判断白蚁主巢的所在，这是彻底消灭的关键”。
    不必再去摘引其他科学家、教授们的相同的看法了。我并不是提倡崇拜名家，但这些谈论大体上都列举了事实作根据，是可以相信的。而那些窃窃私议者，虽宣称“那不能算科学”的高见，但是只闻狺狺然之声，而根据却是连影子也没有。
    其实，不管科学界如何，群众对这件事是有着十分热烈的兴趣和议论的，他们早就在纳闷：二十一个农具改革者和青年农民王保京，都已经被聘为特邀研究员了，为什么李始美没有被聘请？莫非因为昆虫研究所研究的是动物，所以又比研究机械的和研究植物的更高级一些吗？现在，人们不能不认为这同“窃窃私议”是有关系的了。看来这些“私议”目前却能比公开的谈论还有力量，居然能暂时地塞住一个有才能的科学研究者进入研究机关的道路，那末，这些私议者是些什么人？他们有什么根据和高见，又为什么不敢站出来公开谈论呢？
    “窃窃私议”者大约总有些见不得人的东西，所以始终只能是“窃窃私议”。而我们却要在这里大加议论了：
    第一，既然“体现了社会主义的科学道路”的、成为“科学工作多快好省的范例”的、“研究已经超过了国际水平”的人的“学识和技术不能算科学”，那末，现在坐在科学宝座上的那些“能算科学”的人，一定是走的另外的“道路”，是另外的“范例”，而且那“水平”一定是并无创见，白蚁书本上早都有了的。这能算得合理吗？
    第二，一种人在“无保留地把知识和技术贡献给人民”，一种人却在一旁“窃窃私议”挡住道路。既然承认前者是“表现了一个科学工作者的高尚道德”，那末，后者表现了什么，不也就很明白了吗？
    第三，现在既然要走“群众路线”和“重视科学成果是否能彻底解决实际问题”了，那末，“现在各国还没有比李始美的除治白蚁的方法更完善的方法”，又为什么“不能算科学”呢？也许还是“从论文着眼的”吧？可是，李始美的研究不是“已经超过了国际水平”，“李始美的报告是一篇最好的科学论文”了么？这又怎么解释呢？
    看来，“窃窃私议”者，既不是从“论文着眼”，更不是从“解决实际问题”着眼。他们的着眼点只有一个，看你是什么出身和走的是什么道路。如果不是“科班”出身，没有留过洋，没有从资本主义大学里捡回一些又陈又烂的破讲义，没有像他们一样走那条脱离实际的资产阶级的科学道路，尽管有了“超过了国际水平”的研究结果，有了世界上“白蚁书本”上所没有的新发见，有了各国还没有的防治的完善方法，也还是不能算科学的。反之，像白蚁蛀木那样的蛀过书本，啃过几块洋面包，只要像道士念咒一样的背得几个神秘的数字，玄虚的公式，哪怕是一无创见，对实际防治一无所知，甚至只是一个江湖骗子，也还是“能算科学的”，可以牢固地稳坐在科学机关里，而且翻起白眼，横着身子挡着别人的道路。这真是“泾渭分明”得很啊！
    由此，我想到了“白蚁行”，据李始美同志说，“保守技术秘密，唯利是图”的白蚁行商人们曾经拒绝他学习防治白蚁的要求，后来又有十四家白蚁行商人，联名控告他“非法”，要“驱逐”他出境。白蚁行的商人所以这样痛恨他，是因为他揭穿了所谓“技术秘密”的神秘，使它变成了人人能够掌握的“俗”物，断了白蚁行老板们把持高利的路。现在扮演“拒绝”和“驱逐”角色的，变成了“他的技术我早知道了”的只能空发私议的所谓科学家，那原因当然还是由于李始美敢于揭开那些空头科学家们借以吓人的纱幕，还了科学一个本来面目，而且竟然是能说能用，文武双全。让这种人闯进科学队伍里来，坐在一条凳子上，那末，对比之下，那些形形色色的“科学家”：“囤积居奇”的“贪者”、“卖狗皮膏药”的“妄者”，“买空卖空”的“骗者”，岂不又都要露出本来面目。倘不去学点真本事，就要坐不稳那椅子了。于是便要死命地抵住那大门，不许工农出身的、具有丰富的实践经验的人插进身来。
    这些窃窃私议的“科学家”的行径，同那些白蚁行的商人们不是那样地神似么？
    于是，我们便分明的看到了两条道路的斗争。一面是带着纸糊学冠的人们，拚命挡住无产阶级科学大军的前进，力图霸占住科学机关妄想成为他们养尊处优的场所；另一方面，却是劳动人民的洪流，高举着真正科学的大旗，向他们进行冲击，要把科学机关，永远成为人民科学的神圣堡垒。妄想阻挡无产阶级科学大军的前进，是只能得到螳臂当车的可笑的下场的。识时务者，自然还是把路让开的好！
