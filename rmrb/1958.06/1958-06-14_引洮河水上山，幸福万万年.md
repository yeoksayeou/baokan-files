Drawing the Tao River Water Up the Mountain, Happiness for Ten Thousand Years
Li Peifu, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee

The project to divert the Tao River is a decisive siege by the people of Gansu against drought, and after the completion of the project, the people of the whole province will basically get rid of the threat of drought.

Since the second half of last year, Gansu, like other provinces, has launched a great leap forward in industry, agriculture and other undertakings, and the water conservancy industry has leapt forward the fastest. After the completion of the Dongliang Canal in Wushan County, which draws water up the mountain, it opened up a way for Gansu to eliminate drought, became a glorious banner for drawing water up the mountain, and also demonstrated the great power and wisdom of the people. After the mass rectification movement, the revolutionary thinking of cadres and the masses was liberated, and taking the Dongliang Canal as an example, a high tide of water conservancy construction was set off, and the movement of water up the mountain was launched. Up to now, the province has more than 10,000 mu of irrigable land, and more than 150 canals have been built to draw water up the mountain. The characteristics of the water-up-the-mountain movement are large scale, fast speed, good quality, and low investment. In just six months, more than 10 million mu of new water fields have been built. At this time, Gansu Province's water conservancy cause has developed from small to large, from treating symptoms to treating the root causes, and from local prevention and control to comprehensive management. On this basis, an even larger-scale project plan for diverting the Tao River water up the mountain was born. This project is dozens of times larger than the largest canal in Gansu, and is planned to be completed in two years.

"Mountain Canal" Thousands of Miles Long

The Tao River originates from the northern foothills of the Minshan Mountains in southern Gansu Province. For thousands of years, this river has been descending from a high position, rushing north, from Min County through Weiyuan, Lintao to the south of Liujiaxia into the Yellow River, with a total length of more than 500 kilometers. For a long time, more than 20 million mu of land east of the Tao River suffered from drought, while the Tao River water flowed into the Yellow River. The project to divert the Tao River water up the mountain is to block the Tao River in Gucheng, Min County, at an altitude of 2,250 meters in the upper reaches, so that it turns east and flows through Huajialing in Huining County to Dongzhiyuan in Qingyang County at an altitude of 1,400 meters. The canal has a surface width of 32 meters, a bottom width of 16 meters, a water depth of 6 meters, and a water flow of 150 cubic meters per second. The total length of the main canal is 1,130 kilometers. The completion of this canal will not only irrigate 15 million to 20 million mu of land in 23 counties and cities, but also use the drop of the water to generate electricity and pass through small boats. Therefore, some people call this canal a "mountain canal".

The construction of this canal is arduous. The entire canal has to pass through mountains and hills. The specific height of the canal is 250 to 270 meters, and the widest span of the gully is 600 meters, and the narrowest is 50 meters. This canal has to pass through 134 kilometers of stone mountains, 50 tunnels, with a total length of 70 kilometers, and the longest Yanghan Tunnel is 5.6 kilometers. The entire main canal project requires digging 554 million cubic meters of earth and 24 million cubic meters of stone. With the addition of branch canals, the amount of work will be even greater. The technology for building this canal is complicated. For example, surveying and alignment, opening mountains and splitting ridges, erecting aqueducts, tunneling, mechanized construction, building reservoirs, selecting sites for hydropower stations, and producing building materials are all very difficult. From the perspective of manpower, the entire project requires 200,000 laborers to work continuously for two years regardless of cold or heat, which cannot but be an arduous task for Gansu, which has a sparse population. In terms of financial resources, the initial estimate is that the entire project requires an investment of 80 million yuan.

The above-mentioned difficulties have been basically resolved under the revolutionary spirit of the people of Gansu. The entire project requires more than 1,000 technicians, and we have started to solve it from three aspects: First, we will concentrate the technical forces of hydropower, railways, scientific research institutions, etc., and move the intermediate water conservancy school to the construction site to allow students to participate in the construction and cultivate them through practice; second, we will invite the Yellow River Committee and various universities to provide technical support; third, we have trained more than 800 farmer technicians who have been assigned to various work sections. In this way, the entire line already has more than 900 technicians, including more than 10 engineers, which can basically ensure smooth construction. The manpower required for canal construction is entirely borne by the farmers in the beneficiary area, and the enthusiasm of 4.4 million farmers is high. They have decided to set aside 11 percent, about 200,000 laborers, to participate in the construction work year-round. The masses in Dingxi and Tianshui prefectures and Lanzhou city have raised 12 million yuan. The 100,000 cubic meters of wood needed for the project can be solved by clearing the forest, and the cement needed is entirely made of locally produced low-grade cement. Many counties have begun to establish simple factories for woodworking, ironware, lime, cement, explosives, and brick-making to meet the needs of the project. Now, the province has established a Tao River Engineering Committee to uniformly lead this work.

The Tao River diversion project is a typical example of the overall great leap forward in the cause of socialist construction in Gansu Province, and it will bring huge economic benefits to Gansu Province. The irrigation area of this canal is located in central Gansu, where there are bare mountains and ridges, and gullies and ravines. The annual rainfall is only more than 200 mm, which is the driest place in the province. According to historical records, from 1865 to 1947, in the 83 years, there were 11 major droughts, including one continuous drought of two years, three of three years, and one of four years, which is known as "nine droughts in ten years." In the 80,000 square kilometers of land in these 23 counties and cities, more than 20 million mu of land and more than 4 million people have been threatened by drought since ancient times. The completion of this canal will bring the people in the arid areas of the central region 20 million mu of watered land, 400 jin of grain per mu, 300,000 kilowatts of electricity, prosperity of local industry, shipping and aquaculture, and a prosperous life. The biggest enemy of agricultural production in Gansu is drought. Since drought can be quickly eliminated in the driest areas in the central region and the face of nature can be changed, then the work of other areas in the province to overcome drought and change the face of nature will not encounter too many difficulties. Therefore, it is said that the Tao River diversion project is a decisive siege of drought in Gansu, and after the completion of the project, the people of the whole province will basically get rid of the threat of drought.

In fact, the Tao River diversion project not only has significant economic significance, but more importantly, it also marks a new victory for communist thought in Gansu Province. When we look back at the situation of Gansu's march towards nature in the past few years since liberation, we deeply realize the serious significance of ideological revolution. The task of us communists is to transform the objective world, not only to transform society, but also to transform nature. Man should be the master in front of nature, not a slave. Man can recognize and master the laws of nature, change the face of nature, and make nature serve the lives of the people. The history of social development has proved that only when the broad masses of people become the masters of society, that is to say, after socialism began to appear in the world, can people consciously and according to their own ideals and wishes, grasp the laws of nature and transform the face of nature in a planned and large-scale way. Because, only in a society that eliminates exploitation can productive forces be greatly liberated, and can there be a strong force to transform nature. As Engels said: "As mankind becomes the master of its own social relations, it will also become the real and conscious master of nature to the same extent."

However, before the autumn of 1957, not all cadres recognized the above points. On the contrary, some people's thinking has not been liberated. Some people showed fear in the revolutionary task of changing the face of nature. They overemphasized some backward conditions in Gansu Province, exaggerated objective difficulties such as long-term drought, scarce rainfall, and bare mountains and ridges, and ignored the subjective initiative of people. This is the epistemology of the "Gansu backwardness theory" in transforming nature.

In the spring of 1956, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee criticized the "Gansu backwardness theory," pointing out that this was an anti-Marxist-Leninist tendency and a stumbling block hindering the progress of the cause of socialist construction. By the winter of 1957, the province had won the victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, launched a mass rectification movement, conveyed the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and among the cadres and the masses of the province, the communist spirit was strengthened, the prestige of the bourgeoisie was destroyed, revolutionary thinking was liberated, revolutionary enthusiasm was encouraged, and a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production was launched. At this time, in only half a year, more than 10 million mu of new water fields were built, which is almost equal to the total area of water fields built in the eight years after liberation and the more than 2,000 years before liberation. The Tao River diversion project is a concrete manifestation of the victory in carrying out the socialist ideological revolution.

The Revolutionary Style of Farmers

The reason why the plan for the Tao River diversion project could appear so quickly and is bound to become a reality is also the result of the close combination of the spirit of bold revolution in leadership thinking and the revolutionary desire of the broad masses of people to build socialism and build a better life. Before liberation, the people of Gansu were always poor. In the long and suffering life, they had a particularly strong desire to overcome natural disasters, and they also showed the wisdom to fight against nature. For example, the "sand fields" that appeared in the driest areas have always been an effective measure to prevent drought in arid areas. Farmers have suffered from drought for a long time, and they will inevitably leave a fear of nature in their minds, and they cannot consciously realize the greatness of their own strength. However, when agricultural cooperativization is realized, and the Party organization uses socialist thought to educate them, so that they believe in their own strength, the strength and wisdom of the masses will be liberated, showing unparalleled power. The poorest people are also the most revolutionary people. The farmers in Gansu showed a revolutionary style when marching towards nature: they never give up in the face of difficulties, they are not afraid of hardship to eliminate drought, they show great enthusiasm and loyalty to the Party's call, and they are full of the spirit of bold creation in labor. When the farmers heard that the Tao River diversion project was to be built, they immediately responded. The farmers sent telegrams to the province saying: "As long as the Tao River water is diverted to Dongzhiyuan, we have whatever you want"; many farmers in Jingyuan County spontaneously gathered to ask to participate in the construction work, and everyone expressed their determination: "If we don't see the canal, we will not be reconciled, and if the water does not enter Jing (Yuan), we will not give up"; Zhang Yufu, a 14-year-old primary school student in Lintao County, designed a water-powered gunpowder grinding plate, a lever crane, and a pulley crane to support the project, which can increase the labor efficiency in these areas by five to ten times.

In the past few years, because Gansu's economy has been relatively backward, and some undertakings have to be undertaken, we have always adhered to the mass line when undertaking any undertaking. For example, most of the large amount of water fields we have built have been completed by relying on the strength of the masses. However, the Tao River diversion project has not been carried out in Gansu in the past, and the project itself has encountered particularly many difficulties. In the face of this arduous task, do we still believe in the strength of the masses, and do we have the confidence to complete the task? This is a test for our cadres. We did not waver in the face of this test. We still believe that the strength and wisdom of the masses can overcome various difficulties and complete the Tao River diversion project. Facts have proved that we are right, and the masses have given us a positive answer in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Therefore, the Tao River diversion project is not only a profound education on the mass line for our cadres, but also a great practice of the mass line.

When we formulated the construction plan for the Tao River diversion project, some people did not believe that this plan would become a reality. We will use the facts of victory to answer them. Now, more than 10,000 people have gathered at the construction site, and large-scale construction preparation work is underway. In early June, it will start on all fronts. We are determined to complete this huge project on schedule under the slogan "Work hard for two years to divert the Tao River up the mountain, eliminate drought, and happiness for ten thousand years" and under the measures of "the secretary takes action, the people run and the government assists, overall planning, and phased construction." At the same time, we will promote the spirit of building the Tao River diversion project and organize a larger-scale march towards nature. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, coupled with continuously learning from the advanced experience of other provinces, we will be able to quickly change the natural appearance of Gansu and make agricultural production more prosperous.

    引洮河水上山，幸福万万年
    中共甘肃省委农村工作部部长  李培福
    引洮工程是甘肃人民对干旱的一次决定性的围攻，工程完成后全省人民将基本上摆脱旱灾的威胁。
    去年下半年以来，甘肃与其他各省一样，掀起了工业、农业及其他事业的大跃进，而水利事业跃进的最快。武山县引水上山的东梁渠建成以后，给甘肃消灭旱灾打开了一条路，成为引水上山的一面光辉的旗帜，也显示了人民巨大的力量和智慧。经过全民性的整风运动，干部和群众的革命思想解放了，拿东梁渠作榜样，掀起了水利建设的高潮，开展了水上山运动。到目前为止，全省可浇地一万亩以上，引水上山的渠道已有一百五十余条。水上山运动的特点是规模大、速度快、质量好、投资省。在短短六个月的时间里，新修水地一千余万亩。这时，甘肃省的水利事业已由小到大、由治标到治本、由局部防治到全面治理了。就在这个基础上，一个更大规模的、引洮河水上山的工程计划诞生了。这个工程比甘肃现有的最大的渠道大几十倍，计划两年完成。
    “山上运河”千里长
    洮河发源于甘肃省南部岷山的北麓。几千年来，这条河一直踞高临下，奔腾向北，由岷县经渭源、临洮至刘家峡南面入黄河，全长五百余公里。在很长的年代里，洮河东面的两千多万亩土地遭受旱灾的袭击，而洮河水却注入黄河流走了。引洮河水上山的工程，就是要在上游拔海二千二百五十公尺的岷县的古城，把洮河水拦住，使它回头向东流，通过会宁县的华家岭到庆阳县境内拔海一千四百公尺的董志塬。渠道面宽三十二公尺，底宽十六公尺，水深六公尺，水的流量为一百五十秒公方，干渠总长度为一千一百三十公里。建成这条渠，不但可以灌溉二十三个县市的一千五百万到二千万亩土地，还可以利用水的落差发电和通过小型的船只。因此，有人称这条渠为“山上运河”。
    建设这条渠道的工程是艰巨的。整个渠道要通过大山、丘陵，渠道的比高为二百五十至二百七十公尺，跨越沟壑的最宽处为六百公尺，最窄处为五十公尺。这条渠道要通过石山一百三十四公里，打隧道五十孔，全长七十公里，最长的杨寒隧道为五点六公里。整个干渠工程要挖土五点五四亿公方、石方二千四百万公方，加上支渠，工程量会更大。建设这条渠道的技术是复杂的。例如测量选线、开山劈岭、架设渡槽、打通隧道、机械化施工、修水库、选择水力发电站址、生产建筑材料等，困难很多。从人力方面看，整个工程需要二十万劳动力不分寒暑连续工作两年，对人口稀少的甘肃来说，不能不是一项艰巨的任务。在财力方面，初步估计整个工程需投资八千万元。
    上述这些困难，都在甘肃人民革命的干劲下基本获得解决。整个工程需要一千余名技术人员，我们已从三个方面着手加以解决：一是集中水电、铁路、科学研究机关等方面的技术力量，并且把中级水利学校搬上工地，让学生参加施工，从实践中加以培养；一是邀请黄河委员会、各高等院校给予技术上的支援；一是训练了八百多名农民技术员，已分赴各工段工作了。这样，全线已拥有技术人员九百多人，其中有工程师十余人，基本上可以保证顺利地进行施工。修渠所需要的人力，全部由受益区的农民负担，四百四十万农民的热情是高涨的，他们决定抽出百分之十一、约二十万劳动力常年参加建设工作。定西、天水两个专区和兰州市的群众，已集资一千二百万元。工程需要的十万立方米木材可以经过清理林木解决，需要的水泥完全采用地方生产的低标号水泥。许多县，已开始建立木器、铁活、石灰、水泥、炸药、烧砖等简易工厂，以满足工程的需要。现在，省上已成立洮河工程委员会，统一领导这一工作。
    引洮工程是甘肃省社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的一个典型的事例，它将给甘肃省带来巨大的经济利益。这条渠道的灌溉地区位于甘肃中部，这里是童山秃岭，沟壑纵横，年雨量不过二百多公厘，是全省最干旱的地方。据历史记载，从1865年到1947年的八十三年间，发生大旱灾十一次，其中连旱二年的一次，三年的三次，四年的一次，素称“十年九旱”。在这二十三个县市的八万多平方公里的土地上，有两千多万亩土地、四百多万人口自古以来一直受着干旱的威胁。建成这条渠，将给中部干旱地区的人民带来二千万亩水地、亩产四百斤的粮食、三十万瓩的电力、地方工业的繁荣、航运事业和水产事业、富裕的生活。甘肃农业生产的最大敌人是旱灾。既然在中部最干旱地区可以很快消灭干旱，改变大自然的面貌，那末省内其他地区战胜旱灾、改变自然面貌的工作，则不会遇到太大的困难了。所以说引洮工程是甘肃对干旱一次决定性的围攻，工程完成后全省人民将基本上摆脱了旱灾的威胁。
    事实上，引洮工程不仅仅具有经济上的重大意义，而更重要的还标志着共产主义思想在甘肃省取得了新的胜利。当我们回顾甘肃解放后过去几年来向大自然进军的情况时，深刻的认识到思想革命的严重意义。我们共产主义者的任务就是要改造客观世界，不仅要改造社会，而且要改造大自然。人在大自然面前应该是主人，而不是奴隶，人能够认识和掌握自然的规律，改变自然的面貌，使大自然为人们的生活服务。社会发展的历史证明了，只有广大人民成了社会的主人，也就是说在社会主义开始在世界上出现以后，人们才能够自觉地、按照自己的理想和愿望，去掌握大自然的规律，有计划地、大规模地改造自然的面貌。因为，只有在消灭剥削的社会里，才能大大解放生产力，才能有雄厚的力量去改造大自然。正如恩格斯说的：“随着人类成为自己社会关系的主人翁，他们也就以同样的程度成为自然界真正的和自觉的主人翁”。
    然而，在1957年秋季以前，并不是所有的干部都认识上述这点的。相反的，有些人的思想并未解放。有些人在改变大自然面貌的革命任务中，表现了畏惧的情绪，他们过分强调甘肃省某些落后的条件，夸大了长期干旱、雨量稀少、童山秃岭等客观困难，忽视了人的主观能动作用。这就是“甘肃落后论”者在改造自然方面的认识论。
    1956年春天，甘肃省委曾对“甘肃落后论”进行了批判，指出这是反马克思、列宁主义的倾向，是阻碍社会主义建设事业前进的绊脚石。到1957年冬季，全省取得了反右派斗争的胜利，开展了全民性的整风运动，传达了八届三中全会的精神，在全省干部、群众中，长了共产主义的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风，解放了革命思想，鼓足了革命干劲，掀起了工业、农业生产的大跃进。这时，只用了半年的时间，新修水地即达一千多万亩，几乎等于解放后八年和解放前二千多年所修水地的总和。引洮工程就是进行社会主义思想革命取得胜利的具体表现。
    农民的革命风格
    引洮工程的计划所以能很快出现，而且一定能变成现实，还是领导思想上大胆革命的精神和广大人民建设社会主义、建设美好生活的革命愿望紧紧结合的结果。甘肃人民解放以前素来贫困，在长期苦难的生活中，心里蕴藏着战胜自然灾害特别强烈的愿望，也曾表现出向自然进行斗争的智慧。例如，在最干旱的地区出现的“砂田”，一直是干旱地区防旱的有效措施。农民长期受到旱灾的折磨，也必然会在思想上留下对自然的畏惧，不能自觉地意识到自己力量的伟大。但是，当实现了农业合作化以后，党组织用社会主义思想去教育他们，使他们相信自己力量的时候，群众力量和智慧就会得到解放，显示出无与比拟的威力。最贫困的人民，也是最富于革命性的人民。甘肃的农民在向大自然进军的时候，表现出了革命的风格：在困难面前百折不回，为消灭干旱不怕艰苦，对党的号召表现出极大的热情和忠诚，劳动中充满大胆创造的精神。农民听说要修引洮工程，立即响应。农民们给省里打电报说：“只要把洮河水引上董志塬，要什么我们有什么”；靖远县的许多农民自动集会，要求参加建设工作，大家表示的决心是：“不见运河心不甘，水不入靖（远）不罢休”；临洮县一个十四岁的小学生张裕福，为了支援这个工程，设计了水力火药碾药盘、杠杆起重机、滑轮起重机，可以使这些方面的劳动效率提高五到十倍。
    过去几年来，由于甘肃的经济较为落后，有些事业又不能不办，因而我们在办任何一项事业的时候，始终是坚持走群众路线的。例如，我们所修的大量水地，大都是依靠群众的力量完成的。但是，像引洮工程，过去甘肃没有办过，工程本身遇到的困难又特别多。在这个艰巨任务的面前，是否还相信群众的力量呢，有没有完成任务的信心呢，这对我们的干部是个考验。在这个考验面前我们没有动摇，我们仍然相信群众的力量和智慧是能够战胜各种困难，完成引洮工程的。事实证明我们做对了，群众从人力、物力、财力方面给我们以肯定的回答。所以说，引洮工程，不但对我们干部进行了一次深刻的走群众路线的教育，而且是走群众路线一次伟大的实践。
    当我们制订引洮工程建设计划时，也有些人不相信这个计划会变成现实。我们将用胜利的事实去回答他们。现在，一万多人已集中到工地，大规模的施工准备工作正在进行，6月初将全面开工。我们决心在“苦战两年引洮上山，消灭干旱，幸福万年”的口号鼓舞下，在“书记动手，民办公助，全面规划，分期分段施工”的措施下，按期完成这一巨大的工程。同时，发扬建设引洮工程的精神，组织更大规模的向大自然进军。我们坚信，在毛主席和党中央的领导下，加上不断学习其他省的先进经验，一定能够很快地改变甘肃的自然面貌，使农业生产更加繁荣。
