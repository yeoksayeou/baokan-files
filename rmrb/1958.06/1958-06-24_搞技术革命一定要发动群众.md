Under the encouragement of the slogans of technical revolution and cultural revolution, a mass technical reform and invention movement is vigorously developing on the industrial and agricultural production fronts. Some workers, peasants, and small intellectuals with limited education are creating amazing miracles.

Faced with this wave of a nationwide technical revolution, what attitude should we adopt? What methods should we use to lead it? Should we just let a few people work in isolation? Or should we launch a vigorous mass movement? The experience of Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory in carrying out the technical revolution movement, published in today's newspaper, gives us a clear answer: the fundamental method for leading the technical revolution, like leading other work, is to implement the Party's mass line, which is to boldly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, launch a vigorous mass movement, and mobilize every worker and technician to participate in this movement. The Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory does not have a single engineer or college student, but because it fully mobilized the masses, it received more than 1,280 technical reform proposals in three months, some of which solved problems that had not been solved in the national textile dyeing industry in the past. The factory investigated the situation of sixteen workers who had made significant technical reform achievements. In terms of education, seven had elementary school education, three had junior high school education, and six were graduates of secondary vocational schools; in terms of age, eight were between eighteen and twenty-four years old, and eight were over twenty-five years old. This situation is sufficient to show that as long as we exert full effort and strive for the top, ordinary workers and small intellectuals can also create new technologies and promote the tremendous development of production.

To implement the mass line in the technical revolution, the primary link is that the enterprise leaders themselves must break down superstitions. What superstitions should enterprise leaders break down? Some enterprise leaders believe that carrying out the technical revolution can only rely on a few experts and technicians, and they hold a skeptical and contemptuous attitude towards mass technical reforms. They always criticize and pour cold water on the inventions and creations of the masses. Obviously, this is wrong. We do not deny the important role of experts and technicians. In the technical revolution, they must be mobilized to give full play to their enthusiasm. However, if we believe in experts and technicians and fail to mobilize the masses, then the technical revolution will lose its mass base and it will be impossible to achieve significant results. Some leaders of factories and enterprises are also afraid that the technical revolution will disrupt the original production order and affect production. They do not understand that the workers are also very concerned about production. Many technical proposals put forward by workers are precisely the problems that urgently need to be solved in production practice and are closely related to the improvement of labor productivity. Mobilizing the workers will not hinder production; on the contrary, it will only make production better and achieve greater results. As for some comrades who are afraid that the technical reforms of employees will go "out of bounds" and affect the solution of the key problems of the current production of the factory, this is even more unnecessary. In fact, employees generally carry out technical reforms around key production issues. Even if some are not key to production, they should be supported. Although some technical reforms cannot immediately solve the key problems of the current factory, from a long-term perspective and on a larger scale, these technical reforms often have very significant meaning. For example, the method of dyeing silk without dyes, successfully researched by technician Liang Shukai of Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory, although not the factory's current main key problem, this major creation has opened up a new path for China's printing and dyeing industry. This is worthy of attention and reward in any case. Enterprise leaders must liberate their minds, have a broad vision, and firmly trust and rely on the masses. In this way, the mass technical revolution can be carried out rapidly.

To implement the mass line, it is also necessary to carry out meticulous political and ideological work among the vast number of employees, repeatedly publicize the great significance of the technical revolution, and constantly enlighten the consciousness of the masses. We must know that all programs and policies, no matter how correct they are, cannot be realized without the direct support of the broad masses and their persistent struggle. Therefore, in carrying out work, it is necessary to repeatedly enlighten and improve the consciousness of the masses, and help the masses gradually organize themselves and engage in the technical revolution under the principle of voluntary participation. The Party organization of Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory adopted various forms of publicity and repeatedly publicized the political significance of the technical revolution through various vivid examples, which had great practical effect. They paid special attention to enlightening the consciousness of those employees who were in an intermediate and backward state, and closely grasped some creations with a pioneering spirit, expanded publicity with great fanfare, and planted red flags in every corner of the factory. In this way, the workers were encouraged, everyone dared to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and even a few backward employees consciously joined the wave of the technical revolution.

The experience of Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory fully illustrates that an important factor in implementing the mass line in the technical revolution is the high political sensitivity and enthusiastic support of enterprise leaders for new things. The leaders of Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory treated newly emerging things with such an enthusiastic attitude. When they discovered some new creations among the employees, they gave them strong support. The leaders of the factory also eagerly paid attention to learning from the advanced experience of factories in other regions. They did not lightly let go of even a short news item in newspapers and magazines. This sensitivity to new things demonstrates the noble qualities of a Communist Party member and is worthy of everyone's learning!

To correctly guide the technical revolution, in addition to boldly mobilizing the masses, it is also necessary to emphasize that everything must be tested. On the one hand, enterprise leaders must have the revolutionary spirit. The technical revolution is a struggle against nature, and it must have a spirit of fearlessness and dare to boldly support the new creations of employees. On the other hand, we must also combine this revolutionary spirit with a pragmatic spirit. Boldly mobilizing the masses and testing everything are indispensable. Lenin pointed out as early as in "A Great Beginning": "Those who want to solve the more difficult task of defeating capitalism should also have the perseverance to experiment with hundreds or even thousands of new methods, forms, and means of struggle until the most appropriate method is formulated from them." Political struggle is like this, and so is the technical revolution. Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory conducted separate tests for the innovative proposals of employees. General sporadic proposals were tested by the group responsible; more important ones were tested by the workshop; and those involving the entire factory were tested under the leadership of the factory. Before the experiment, the leaders of the factory made full estimates of the two possibilities of success and failure. If the experiment failed, they were not discouraged, but encouraged the employees to learn from the lessons and continue the experiment. This method is in line with dialectical materialism. If the leaders of the enterprise abandon their support for the creativity of the employees because of a temporary failure, then it will inevitably frustrate the enthusiasm of the employees and cause some major reforms that might have been successfully tested to fail.

Conscientiously implementing the Party's mass line, boldly mobilizing the masses, and testing everything are the correct methods for us to lead the technical revolution. As long as the leaders of our enterprises use the method of the mass line, enthusiastically support the creations of the masses, and lead this technical revolution movement, we will surely be able to achieve great victories like leading other work, and we will be able to continuously push the mass technical revolution to new heights and continuously improve social productivity.

### 搞技术革命一定要发动群众

    搞技术革命一定要发动群众
    在技术革命和文化革命的口号鼓舞之下，目前在工农业生产战线上，群众性的技术改革和发明创造正蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。一些文化水平不高的工人、农民和小知识分子，正在创造着惊人的奇迹。
    面对着这个全民技术革命的浪潮，我们应当采取什么态度？用什么方法去领导它？只是冷冷清清地让少数人空忙呢？还是开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动？今天本报发表的天津织染厂开展技术革命运动的经验，给我们作了明确的回答：对于技术革命的领导和对其他工作的领导一样，根本的方法就是贯彻执行党的群众路线，就是要放手发动群众、依靠群众，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，发动每一个工人、技术人员投入这个运动。天津织染厂全厂没有一个工程师，没有一个大学生，但是因为充分发动了群众，三个月中就出现了一千二百八十多项技术改革的建议，其中有几项是过去全国织染行业没有解决的问题，现在得到解决了。这个工厂调查了十六名有重大技术改革成就的工人的情况，其中从文化程度上看，小学程度的七人，初中程度的三人，中等专业学校毕业生六人；从年龄上看，十八岁到二十四岁的八人，二十五岁以上的八人。这个情况足以说明：只要鼓足干劲、力争上游，普通的工人和小知识分子也能够创造新的技术，促进生产的巨大发展。
    要在技术革命中贯彻执行群众路线，首要的一环是企业领导者自己必须破除迷信。在企业领导干部中要破除哪些迷信呢？有些企业领导者认为开展技术革命，只能依靠少数专家、技术人员，对群众性的技术改革抱着怀疑和轻视态度，对群众的发明创造，总是评头论足，泼泼冷水。很显然，这是错误的。我们不否认专家、技术人员的重要作用，在技术革命中必须把他们动员起来，充分发挥他们的积极性。但是，如果迷信专家、技术人员而不去发动群众，那末，技术革命就丧失了群众基础，就不可能取得重大的成果。还有一些工厂企业的领导干部害怕技术革命会打乱原来的生产秩序，影响生产。他们不了解工人群众同样是非常关心生产的。工人提出的许多技术倡议，正是生产实践中迫切需要解决的问题，对于劳动生产率的提高有十分密切的关系。发动工人群众不但不会妨害生产，相反的，只会使生产搞得更好，得到更大的成绩。至于还有一些同志害怕职工的技术改革出了“框框”，会影响对当前本厂生产关键问题的解决。这更是不必要的顾虑。事实上，职工们一般地都是围绕生产关键问题来进行技术改革的。即使有的不是生产关键，也应该予以支持。有些技术改革虽然不能立即解决当前本厂的关键问题，但是从长远看、从大的范围看，这些技术改革往往有十分重大的意义。例如天津织染厂技术员梁树楷研究成功的不用染料染丝绸的方法，虽然不是该厂当前主要的关键问题，但是这个重大的创造，为我国印染工业开拓了一条新的道路。这无论如何是值得重视和奖励的。企业的领导者必须解放思想，目光远大，坚定地信任群众，依靠群众。这样，群众性的技术革命，才能够迅速地开展起来。
    要贯彻执行群众路线，还必须向广大职工进行细致的政治思想工作，反复宣传技术革命的伟大意义，不断地启发群众的自觉。要知道，一切纲领和政策，不论怎样正确，如果没有广大群众直接的拥护和坚持到底的奋斗，都是无法实现的。因此，在进行工作的时候，必须反复地启发和提高群众的觉悟，在群众出于内心自愿的原则之下，帮助群众逐步地组织起来，投入技术革命中去。天津织染厂的党组织采取各种各样的宣传形式，通过各种活生生的事例，反复宣传技术革命的政治意义，有很大的实际效果。他们特别注意启发那些处于中间状态和落后状态的职工的自觉性，并且紧紧抓住一些具有首倡精神的创造，大喊大叫地扩大宣传，将红旗插遍全厂各个角落。这样，使工人意气振奋，人人敢想、敢说、敢做，连少数落后的职工也自觉地投入了技术革命的浪潮中。
    天津织染厂的经验充分地说明：在技术革命中贯彻执行群众路线的重要因素，是企业领导者对于新生事物的高度政治敏感和热情支持。天津织染厂的领导者，正是用这种热情的态度，对待刚刚萌芽的新生事物。他们一发现职工中有一些新的创造的时候，就大力予以支持。工厂的领导者对其他地区工厂的先进经验，也如饥如渴地注意学习。对于报纸、杂志上一条简短的消息，他们都不轻轻放过。这种对于新鲜事物的敏感，表现了共产党员的高尚品质，值得大家学习！
    要正确地指导技术革命，除了放手发动群众以外，还要强调一切经过试验。一方面，企业的领导者必须有革命的气魄。技术革命就是向自然界斗争，必须有大无畏的精神，敢于大胆地支持职工的新创造。另一方面，我们还必须把这种革命气概和求实的精神结合起来。放手发动群众和一切经过试验是不可偏废的。列宁在“伟大的创举”中早已指出：“要想解决战胜资本主义这一更困难任务的人们，也就应该具有坚忍精神来试验几百以至几千种新的斗争方法、方式和手段，直至从中制定出最适当的办法时止。”政治斗争是这样，技术革命同样是这样。天津织染厂对于职工的革新倡议，都分别进行试验。一般零星倡议，由小组负责试验；比较重大的，由车间试验；涉及全厂性的，由工厂领导上主持试验。在试验以前，工厂的领导干部对于成功和失败的两种可能都作了充分的估计。试验失败了，也不灰心，而是鼓励职工吸取教训，继续进行试验。这种方法，是符合于辩证唯物主义的。如果企业的领导者因为一时失败就放弃了对职工群众创造性的支持，那末，必然会挫折职工群众的积极性，使一些可能试验成功的重大改革流于失败。
    认真贯彻执行党的群众路线，放手发动群众，一切经过试验，是我们领导技术革命的正确方法。只要我们企业的领导者用群众路线的方法，满腔热情地支持群众的创造，领导这个技术革命运动，我们就一定能够像领导其他工作一样取得伟大的胜利，就能够将群众性的技术革命不断地推向新的高峰，不断地提高社会生产力。
