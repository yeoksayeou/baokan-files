Six Routes Depart, Ten Thousand People Inspect

The front-page headline of the Shanxi Daily on the 7th reported that the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee sent a powerful inspection team to six regions across the province to promote the Party's general line for socialist construction, inspect and promote the great leap forward in industrial production and capital construction throughout the province, and further set off a high tide of industrial production and construction. The inspection team was composed of personnel from industrial departments at all levels, with a total of 10,000 participants. The Provincial Party Committee believes that June and July are the two months that determine the overall situation of industrial production in the province. If efforts are not stepped up, it will create difficulties for the realization of this year's industrial leap forward plan. This inspection should effectively play a role in promoting a new high tide.

One Prefecture Establishes Ten Thousand Factories

The Gansu Daily reported on the 6th: Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu has leaped to become a prefecture with ten thousand factories. The thirteen counties and cities in the entire prefecture have already built 10,035 factories and mines, including more than 350 backbone factories, forming an industrial network with both muscles and bones. The basic experience of the Pingliang Prefectural Committee in running industry is to break down superstitious ideas, liberate leadership thinking, and implement the policy of relying on the masses to run things on a large scale and quickly. Various counties conducted extensive publicity through broadcast meetings, oath-taking rallies, symposiums, and on-site evaluation meetings. Pingliang County also put forward the slogan of "Debate if you don't understand, watch if you don't know, debate and do it, watch and build it." In the high tide of running industry on a large scale, there emerged the leadership methods of "three secretaries (Party secretaries of the county, township, and commune) taking command, three chiefs (county head, township head, and commune head) grasping key points, three teams of people (one for publicity, one for building factories, and one for inspection and grasping production)," and three battlefronts, interlocked with each other.

New Peak in Gauze Quality

Textile workers throughout Shaanxi Province fought hard for forty days to achieve the annual leap forward target, catching up with Wuxi and surpassing Zhengzhou, and the quality of major gauze products has reached the highest peak in the country. The Shaanxi Daily and Xi'an Daily both used nearly the entire front page on June 7 to report this inspiring good news. The banner headline of the Shaanxi Daily was "In the Brilliant Era Where One Day Equals Twenty Years," and the Xi'an Daily had the large-character slogan "Refute the Theory of Conditions, Eliminate Inferiority Complex, and Strive to Be a Model for the National Textile Industry!" to the left of its masthead. Both newspapers published comprehensive reports and victory announcements from various factories after forty days of hard work, as well as congratulatory messages from the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. Both newspapers published editorials and specially introduced the advanced example of the "Three Olds" (old people, old machines, old equipment) of the Dahua Textile Factory transforming into "Three Treasures."

One Pond, Three Uses

The Jiangxi Daily had a fresh piece of news on the 6th: "One Pond, Three Uses" in Xin Cun Commune. Xin Cun Agricultural Cooperative in Pingxiang County brought its creativity into full play, turning a stinky pond into a three-use pond where fish are raised in the water, water hyacinth is planted on the surface (as pig feed), and melons are grown in sheds by the pond. At the beginning, because water hyacinth grew all over the pond, affecting the growth of the fish, the commune members who raised fish and those who raised pigs even had disputes over this. Later, everyone came up with a win-win solution, which was to use bamboo poles to build a square grid in the center of the pond, leaving a certain amount of water surface for the water hyacinth to grow outside the grid. After this method was successful, twenty-three ponds in the entire commune achieved the three-use, increasing income by nearly 4,000 yuan. The Pingxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China is preparing to promote this experience throughout the county by means of visits and exhibitions.

　　在各地报纸上
    六路出发万人检查
    7日的山西日报一版头条消息报道，中共山西省委派出强大的检查团，分赴全省六个地区，宣传党的社会主义建设总路线，检查和推动全省工业生产和基本建设的大跃进，进一步掀起工业生产和建设的大高潮。检查团由各级工业部门人员组成，共有万人参加。省委认为6、7两个月是决定全省工业生产大局的两个月，如不加一把劲，就会给今年工业跃进计划的实现造成困难，这次检查要切实起到促进新高潮的作用。
    一个专区建立了一万个工厂
    6日的甘肃日报报道：甘肃平凉专区一跃而为万厂专区，全专区十三个县、市已经建成一万零三十五个厂矿，其中有三百五十多个骨干厂，形成了一个既有肌肉又有骨胳的工业网。平凉地委办工业的基本经验是大破迷信观念，解放领导思想，贯彻了依靠群众大办快办的方针，各县通过广播会、誓师会、座谈会、现场评比会等进行广泛宣传。平凉县并提出了“不通就辩，不懂就看，边辩边干，边看边建”的口号。在大办工业高潮中出现了三书（县、乡、社的党的书记）挂帅，三长（县长、乡长、社长）抓点，三套人马（一套宣传、一套建厂、一套进行检查和抓生产），三条战线，互相连环的领导方法。
    纱布质量的新高峰
    陕西全省纺织工人奋战四十天，实现全年跃进指标，赶上无锡，超过郑州，主要纱布质量跃居全国最高峰。6月7日的陕西日报和西安日报都以第一版将近整版的地位，报道这个振奋人心的喜事。陕西日报的通栏总标题是“在一天等于二十年的光辉时代里”，西安日报的报头左边是“驳倒条件论，打掉自卑感，要当全国纺织工业模范！”的大字标语。两报都登载了各厂奋战四十天的综合报道和报捷新闻、省委和省人委的贺电。两报都发表了社论，并且特别介绍了大华纺织厂“三老”（人老、机器老、设备老）变“三宝”的先进事例。
    一个塘三种用途
    6日的江西日报有一条新鲜的消息：新村社“一塘三用”。萍乡县新村农业社发挥创造性，把一个臭水塘变成了水中养鱼，水面种水浮莲（作猪饲料），塘边搭棚种瓜三用池塘。在开始时，因为水浮莲繁殖满塘，影响鱼的生长，养鱼的社员和养猪的社员为此还发生争执。后来大家想出两全其美的办法，就是在塘中央用竹竿架一个四方空格，空出一定水面，让水浮莲在这个空格外边繁殖。这办法成功后，全社有二十三口塘做到一塘三用，增加收入近四千元。中共萍乡县委正准备用参观展览办法，在全县推广这个经验。
