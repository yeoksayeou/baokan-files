    A Short History of Big-Character Posters
    Fang Hanqi
    The "big-character poster" form created by the Chinese people in the nationwide rectification movement is brand new, but also has a rich historical tradition. Although people in the past did not use the name "big-character poster," their so-called "public notices," "official bulletins," "long reds," etc., were actually big-character posters.
    As early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, the peasant rebel army led by Zhang Xianzhong already knew how to use big-character posters for propaganda. Every time this team of working peasants occupied a place, they immediately used big-character posters to announce their policies, expose the names of local despots and evil gentry, and encourage victims to file complaints against them. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and other organized peasant uprisings of the same period also used this weapon for propaganda. Many political declarations of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were announced to the masses in the form of big-character posters. Before attacking a place, the Taiping Army often sent some people to infiltrate behind enemy lines and use big-character posters to encourage local people to rise up in response. In areas that had already been occupied, big-character posters were used to publicize laws and policies.
    Big-character posters also played a tremendous role in the heroic struggles of the Chinese people against imperialism and its running dogs in modern China. In 1841, the patriotic people near Sanyuanli in Guangzhou, while actively organizing the "Anti-British Corps," posted many big-character posters written in the form of ballads and cartoons to accuse the atrocities of British imperialists and express the Chinese people's determination to resist aggression. In 1845, when the British invading army demanded to enter Guangzhou city, many anti-British mass armed organizations once again used big-character posters to mobilize the masses, agreeing to "close the doors and start an uprising on the day the barbarians enter the city."
    During the Tianjin Massacre of 1870, the Sino-French War of 1884, and the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, patriotic people in Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places also used the weapon of big-character posters to fight against imperialism and the feudal ruling government. This weapon once greatly annoyed the rulers. Some places even promulgated measures to prohibit the posting of "anonymous" big-character posters.
    The Boxers around 1900 were also very good at using big-character posters as a weapon to fight against the enemy. In Beijing, Tianjin, and areas where the Boxers were more active, such as Shandong, Shaanxi, and Gansu, big-character posters were plastered everywhere and could be seen everywhere. They came in various forms, including prose, verse, stories, and gathas. On the surface, the content seemed to have some backward religious and superstitious elements, but basically it was still carrying out propaganda against imperialism; its purpose was still to strengthen its own morale, destroy the enemy's prestige, and encourage the masses to actively participate in the current heated anti-imperialist struggle. The Boxer's big-character posters were not only diverse in type, but also large in quantity. Most of the big-character posters were directly posted in places where enemies often appeared, such as government offices, embassies, and churches; the momentum was huge and aggressive, which really made those cowardly clowns lose their souls and be terrified. Many diplomats of imperialist countries have more than once described in their reports to their own governments the tense mood in which they were besieged by the Boxer's big-character posters, living in fear all day long.
    The same big-character posters were also widely used in the boycott of American goods in 1905 and the independent church movement in 1906.
    During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, big-character posters were an important tool for the Party to carry out propaganda, mobilization, and organizational work among the workers and peasants. It was not restricted by publication dates, the publication method was relatively flexible, and the text was relatively simple, which could supplement the shortcomings of general regular revolutionary newspapers and periodicals. In the successive revolutionary movements led by the Party, big-character posters played the role of an assistant to general revolutionary newspapers and periodicals.
    The Party attaches great importance to the role of big-character posters in propaganda work. During the Great Revolution, the resolution of the First Hunan Provincial Farmers' Congress convened under the leadership of the Party required "to select simple, powerful words and meanings that farmers can understand, according to the needs of farmers, to make slogans and pictorials." This is actually big-character posters. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the headquarters and Party department of the Fourth Red Army (Army Commander Zhu De, Party Representative Mao Zedong) often issued announcements in the form of big-character posters to publicize current affairs and policies to workers, peasants, merchants, and intellectuals.
    The current big-character poster was produced in the rectification movement last year. It was born out of the old big-character posters in history, inherited the revolutionary and fighting traditions, and has new developments and supplements. The new big-character posters not only have struggles against the enemy, but also expose contradictions within the people; there are criticisms and self-criticisms, as well as rationalization proposals and commendations of advanced figures; the content is rich and the forms are diverse; these are things that old big-character posters did not have or had but were insufficient. Compared with the old big-character posters, the current big-character posters are better than the blue and better. (Attached picture)

    大字报史话
    方汉奇
    我国人民在全民整风运动中所创造的“大字报”的形式是崭新的，同时也是有丰富的历史传统的。虽然从前的人们不用大字报这个名称，但是他们所谓“揭帖”“露布”“长红”等等实际上都是大字报。
    还在十七世纪初页的时候，张献忠领导下的农民起义军，就已经知道怎样利用大字报来进行宣传。这一支劳动农民的队伍，每攻占一个地方，就立刻用大字报来公布他们的政策，揭露当地土豪劣绅的姓名，鼓励苦主向他们提出控诉。太平天国和同时期的其他有组织的起义农民，也运用这种武器来进行宣传。太平天国的许多政治宣言，就是利用大字报的方式向群众公布的。太平军在进攻一个地方之前，往往先派出一些人潜入敌后，用大字报来鼓动当地群众起来响应。在已经占领的地区，大字报则用来公布法令，宣传政策。
    大字报在近代中国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争中，也起了极为巨大的作用。1841年，广州三元里附近的爱国人民，在积极组织“平英团”的同时，就贴出了不少用歌谣、漫画等方式编写的大字报，控诉英帝国主义者的暴行，表示了中国人民反对侵略的决心。1845年，英国侵略军队要求进入广州城的时候，不少反英的群众武装组织再一次用大字报来动员群众，相约“夷人入城之日，闭门起事。”
    在1870年天津教案、1884年中法战争和1894年中日战争期间，天津、上海、广州等地爱国人民，也都曾使用过大字报这种武器，向帝国主义和封建统治政府进行斗争。这种武器曾经使统治者大为恼怒。某些地方甚至为此颁布了禁止张贴“匿名”大字报的办法。
    1900年前后的义和团，也都很善于利用大字报这种武器进行对敌斗争。在北京、天津和山东、陕西、甘肃等义和团比较活跃的地区，大字报都遍贴通衢，随处可见。它们的形式是多种多样的，有散文，有韵文，有故事，有偈语。内容从表面上看来，颇有一些落后的宗教和迷信的成分，但基本上仍然是在进行着反对帝国主义思想的宣传；其目的也仍然是为了长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，鼓动群众踊跃的参加到当前的火热的反帝斗争中来。义和团的大字报不仅种类多，数量也多。大部分的大字报都直接贴在衙署、使馆、教堂等敌人经常出没的地方；声势浩大，咄咄逼人，真能使那些色厉内荏的跳梁小丑们失魂落魄，肉跳心惊。不少帝国主义国家的外交官在写给本国政府的报告中，都不止一次的描述过他们在义和团的大字报围剿下的那种惶惶不可终日的紧张心情。
    同样的大字报，在1905年的抵制美货运动和1906年的自立教会运动中，也曾经普遍的使用过。
    在新民主主义革命时期，大字报是党向工农群众进行宣传鼓动和组织工作的重要工具。它不受刊期的限制，出版的方式比较灵活，文字也比较浅显，可以补一般定期的革命报刊之不足。在党所领导的历次革命运动中，大字报都起了一般革命报刊的助手的作用。
    党很重视大字报在宣传工作中的作用。大革命时期，党领导下召开的湖南全省第一次农代会决议要“根据农民要求，选择简单有力而农民所能懂得的文字及意义，作成标语及画报”这其实也就是大字报。第二次国内革命战争时期，红军第四军的司令部和党部（军长朱德、党代表毛泽东）就经常以大字报的形式发布布告，向工农群众和商人、知识分子宣传时事政策。
    现在的大字报是从去年整风运动中产生的，它脱胎于历史上的旧大字报，继承了其中的革命的战斗的传统，而又有了新的发展和补充。新的大字报不仅有对敌人的斗争，也有对人民内部矛盾的揭露；有批评与自我批评，也有合理化建议和对先进人物的表扬；内容丰富，形式多采；这些都是旧大字报所没有或有而不足的。和旧大字报比起来，现在的大字报是青出于蓝而胜于蓝了。（附图片）
