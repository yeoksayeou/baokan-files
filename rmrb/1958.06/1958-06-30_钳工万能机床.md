    Fitter's Universal Machine Tool
    Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: A bench-top fitter's universal machine tool designed by Li Huange, a young fitter at the factory of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has been successfully trial-produced with the cooperation of workers Zhou Zhengfang, Chen Zebang, and others. It performed well during an operational demonstration. They named this machine tool the "Leap Forward No. 1" Fitter's Universal Machine Tool as a gift to the Party's birthday.
    The birth of the fitter's universal machine tool will enable most of the complex manual fitter's techniques in small factories and repair stations to be mechanized. This machine tool can perform fourteen operations such as drilling, milling, graduating, boring, punching, slotting, shearing, sawing, and filing. In addition, it has a universal rotary worktable that can move in any direction and automatically position itself during work. In this way, one person can complete multiple processes, greatly reducing labor and shortening the time for process transfers. Because this machine tool has versatility and a simple, ingenious structure, it has great value for use in small factories and the development of local township industries.

    钳工万能机床
    据新华社29日讯　中国科学院物理研究所工厂的青年钳工厉焕阁所设计的一种台式钳工万能机床，已在工人周正芳、陈泽邦等合作下试制成功，经过操作表演效能良好。他们把这种机床命名为“跃进一号”钳工万能机床，作为向党的生日的献礼。
    钳工万能机床的诞生，将使小型工厂和修理站手工操作的复杂的钳工技术能大部分机械化。这种机床能作钻、铣、刻度、搪孔、冲、插、剪、锯、锉等十四种操作，另外还有万能旋转工作台，工作时能作任何方向移动，自动定位。这样一个人就能完成多种工序的活，大大减少了人力和缩短了工序转移的时间。由于这种机床具备了万能性，构造简单、灵巧，因此在小型工厂和发展地方乡镇工业中就有很大的使用价值。
