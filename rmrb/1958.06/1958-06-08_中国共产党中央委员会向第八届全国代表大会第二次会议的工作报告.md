Some people doubt whether agricultural production can grow rapidly. They have quoted classics to prove that agricultural development can only be slow and cannot be guaranteed. Some scholars have even asserted that the growth rate of agriculture cannot keep up with the population growth rate. They believe that with more people, consumption will increase, and accumulation cannot increase much. Therefore, they have made pessimistic conclusions about the development speed of agriculture in our country and even the entire national economy. The essence of this idea is to despise our country's organized revolutionary peasants, and therefore it cannot but be refuted by the facts. This year's great leap forward in agricultural production and construction in our country has not only completely overturned their argument that agricultural development cannot be fast, but also completely overturned their argument that more people hinder accumulation. They only see people as consumers, and that more people means more consumption, but they do not primarily see people as producers, and that more people means there is the possibility of producing more and accumulating more. Obviously, this is a view that violates Marxism-Leninism.

　　有人怀疑农业生产究竟能不能迅速增长。他们曾经引经据典，证明农业的发展只能是慢慢的，并且是不能保证的。某些学者甚至断定，农业增长的速度还赶不上人口增长的速度。他们认为，人口多了，消费就得多，积累就不能多，由此，他们对于我国农业以至整个国民经济的发展速度作出了悲观的结论。这种思想的本质是轻视我国组织起来了的革命的农民，因而不能不受到事实的反驳。今年我国农业的生产建设的大跃进，不但彻底推翻了他们的农业发展快不了的论断，而且彻底推翻了他们的人多了妨碍积累的论断。他们只看到人是消费者，人多消费要多，而不首先看到人是生产者，人多就有可能生产得更多，积累得更多。显然，这是一种违反马克思列宁主义的观点。
