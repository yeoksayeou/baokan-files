Guangzhou, June 8th (Our Dispatch) - In order to create a miracle of high yield in the late rice crop, Lihu and Meitang Townships in Puning County, Guangdong Province, swiftly organized a vigorous fertilizer accumulation campaign before the busy summer harvest. The East Route Agricultural Inspection Team, headed by Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, inspected the production situation in these two townships and expressed hope that all agricultural cooperatives in the province would learn from their practices.

This year, Lihu Township expects to produce 430 jin per mu of early rice, but due to insufficient fertilizer, the increase is only 60 jin compared to last year's early rice. Compared to some townships and cooperatives in Puning where the yield increased by 100 to 200 jin per mu, they felt that the increase in early rice was too small. They have made the greatest determination to achieve a late rice yield of 1,500 jin per mu. The main methods to achieve this combat goal are to produce more fertilizer and plant as densely as possible. They plan to increase the number of seedlings planted per mu from more than 20,000 to 50,000 to 75,000; the fertilizer requirement is four times that of early rice, i.e., ensuring 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu. However, the progress of fertilizer accumulation has been relatively slow. As of June 8th, with only a few days left before the busy early rice harvest, the two townships had accumulated less than 300 dan of fertilizer per mu. Without sufficient fertilizer, the plan to increase the late rice yield by 1,500 jin per mu would be in danger of failing. Lihu Township reversed the fertilizer shortage situation by using a mass campaign approach. Starting on June 9th, they showed the same vigor as when transplanting early rice, mobilizing all people and all tools to find and dig up all usable fertilizer. On the evening of the 9th alone, they accumulated 1,070,000 dan of fertilizer. Now, the farmers of Lihu Township are working hard to realize the slogan "Work hard for seven days and nights to accumulate 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu." Upon hearing this, the farmers of the neighboring Meitang Township proposed the slogan "Exceed 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, overwhelm Lihu Township, and strive for the first place in the county." Township and cooperative cadres estimate that if the current rate of fertilizer accumulation continues, the late rice fertilizer problem will definitely be solved as scheduled.

Comrade Tao Zhu and other responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee's East Route Inspection Team arrived in Puning County Town on the evening of the 10th. After hearing the exciting news that the farmers of Lihu and Meitang Townships were competing day and night to accumulate fertilizer, they rushed to the scene that night with Li Xueguang, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and Zhang Shun, First Secretary of the Puning County Committee, to visit. At that time, the night was deep, and in the villages within a radius of twenty or thirty li, along the roads, and on the hillsides, there were stars of light everywhere, and the sound of people was noisy. Arriving at Lihu Township at 10:00 p.m., the lights illuminated the area as if it were daytime, and more than 30,000 fertilizer accumulating troops were working vigorously. Under hundreds of gasoline lamps, kerosene lamps, and bean oil lamps, approximately several thousand people were digging up the street soil of Lihu Village. The streets and alleys were crowded with people.

The Provincial Party Committee's East Route Inspection Team believes that the views of these two townships on fertilizer accumulation are correct, the fertilizer accumulation targets are feasible, and the practice of accumulating fertilizer day and night with soaring enthusiasm is well worth learning by all agricultural cooperatives in the province. All agricultural cooperatives in the province should learn from Lihu Township and Meitang Township and immediately launch a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign to ensure that this year's late rice crop achieves even greater increases in production.

### 为晚稻增产突击肥料  普宁县鲤湖、梅塘乡的做法值得推广

    为晚稻增产突击肥料
    普宁县鲤湖、梅塘乡的做法值得推广
    本报广州8日电　广东普宁县鲤湖、梅塘两乡为了创造晚造丰产奇迹，在夏收大忙之前，迅即组织一个热火朝天的积肥突击运动。以中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志为首的东路农业检查团，在检查了这两个乡的生产情况之后，希望全省农业社学习他们的做法。
    今年鲤湖乡每亩早稻预计产四百三十斤，但由于肥料不足，比去年早稻只增产六十斤，这和普宁有些乡社每亩增产一二百斤相较，他们感到早稻增产太少了。他们下了最大决心，要使晚造亩产粮食达到一千五百斤。实现这个战斗的指标的主要办法是多搞肥料和尽量的密植。他们计划每亩插秧数要由二万多棵增到五万棵到七万五千棵；肥料要求比早稻增加四倍，即每亩保证下肥二千担。可是，积肥进度比较缓慢，到6月8日止，离早稻收获大忙时间只有几天了，两个乡每亩积肥还不到三百担。没有充足的肥料，晚稻每亩增产一千五百斤的计划便有落空的危险。鲤湖乡用群众性突击的办法扭转了缺肥的局面。6月9日起，他们拿出早稻插秧时的那股干劲，动员一切人、一切工具去寻找和挖取一切用得着的肥料。9日一个晚上，积肥一百零七万担。现在，鲤湖乡农民正在努力实现“苦战七昼夜，每亩积肥两千担”的口号。相邻的梅塘乡农民听到了，便提出“每亩积肥超过二千担，压倒鲤湖乡，争取全县第一名”的口号。乡社干部估计，按照现在积肥运动的速度发展下去，晚造肥料的问题肯定会如期解决的。
    陶铸同志和东路检查团的其他负责同志10日黄昏到了普宁县城，听到鲤湖、梅塘两乡农民挑灯比赛积肥这一令人兴奋的消息后，当晚同地委副书记李雪光、普宁县委第一书记张顺同志赶往现场访问。是时，夜色深沉，在方圆二三十里内的村庄里，公路旁，山坡上，处处星光点点，人声喧闹。10时到达鲤湖乡，那里，灯火照耀得如同白昼，三万多积肥大军干得正在热闹。在几百盏汽灯，煤油灯，豆油灯下，大约有几千人在挖取鲤湖村的街道土。大街小巷，人山人海。
    省委东路检查团认为：这两个乡对积肥的看法是正确的，积肥指标是可行的，用冲天干劲、日夜突击积肥的做法很值得全省农业社学习。全省农业社应学习鲤湖乡和梅塘乡，立即掀起一个大规模的积肥突击运动，保证今年晚造能获更大的增产。　（杜导正）
