    After Overcoming Inferiority Complex
    By our staff reporter Zhao Yuxin
    Chairman Mao's instructions on breaking down superstitions and liberating thought have opened the door to technological innovation for the workers of the Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory, like a key.
    Zhang Yanwen, a young worker who is twenty-three years old, did not graduate from elementary school, and whose demeanor is still somewhat childish, recently made a suggestion to Gu Yisun, a technician nearly fifty years old, that caustic soda refining should not be used in dyeing cloth. This veteran technician, who has been engaged in the printing and dyeing industry for more than twenty years, solemnly said to him: "This method not only directly conflicts with the theories in books, but also violates the actual operating experience of the printing and dyeing industry at home and abroad; imagination without scientific basis is called fantasy." But Zhang Yanwen replied without flinching: "If our experiment is successful, won't the scientific basis come out?"
    Sure enough, in less than twenty days, Zhang Yanwen's "fantastic" innovation project was successfully tested with the help of the factory director and workers of the Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory. What power encouraged this young man to dare to break through the siege and declare war on the authority of books and conventional practices? Zhang Yanwen said: "After listening to Chairman Mao's words, I became bolder."
    Liang Shukai, a young technician and the originator of dyeing without dyes, once made the following statement when describing his process of ideological liberation: "Daring to think seems easy. In fact, to dare to express one's ideals in public, one must overcome many obstacles." Four years ago, when Liang Shukai was studying at the Shijiazhuang Technical School, he returned to his hometown – Feixiang County, Hebei Province, which is rich in cotton – for a winter vacation. A fellow villager once asked him:
    "What technology are you learning at school?"
    "Bleaching and dyeing."
    "Do you need to go to school to learn bleaching and dyeing? Just put the white cloth in the dye vat and it becomes blue cloth. You can just be an apprentice in the big dye workshop in our village."
    "No, I am learning modern bleaching and dyeing technology, which uses large machines for production and chemical methods for ingredients. There is a lot of knowledge in it."
    "No matter how much knowledge there is, you still have to use dyes! If you can dye colored cloth without dyes, then you will have mastered it!"
    This half-joking conversation gave Liang Shukai a lot of inspiration. Since then, he has thought more than once: Could dyeing cloth without dyes become a reality? But he immediately rejected this idea, thinking that it was a fantasy that violated scientific knowledge, a beautiful myth, just something to think about. In the winter of 1955, he worked in the laboratory of the Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory. A classmate told him in a casual conversation that a Soviet expert had said that wool fiber contains nitrogen. If it is combined with metal salts and sodium nitrite to "diazotize" it, it will change the color of the wool. Driven by curiosity, he bought a skein of white wool and secretly did an experiment in a glass during off-hours in the laboratory. The "diazotized" wool really showed grass green and light purple colors. He was so excited that he almost cried out, thinking that the ideal of dyeing without dyes had at least shown a glimmer of hope in wool fabrics. However, the clouds of an inferiority complex immediately obscured his wisdom. "I am just an ordinary technician who has been working for less than a year. I don't have much knowledge or experience. Don't be half-baked. How can I do scientific research? Besides, if it were possible, foreign scientists would have already achieved it. I have studied for three years and have not seen this method in books, so it must not work." So, he hid the experimental records and samples under his box, and for three years he did not mention this matter to anyone.
    At the beginning of this year, he was approved to be transferred to the dyeing workshop to participate in labor. Every day, he carried a bucket of dye, walking between the dye vat and the dyeing machine. Looking at the silk rolling in the dye vat, a new idea came to his mind: "Wool is animal fiber, and silk is also animal fiber. If the 'diazotization' method is used on silk, will it dye color?" "Most of the dyes we use to dye silk are imported and very expensive. If the research is successful, how much foreign exchange can we save for the country?" But when he thought, "What if it fails?" Wouldn't it be even more disgraceful? His courage disappeared again. In March, under the call of the Party Central Committee, the workers of this factory launched a technological innovation campaign, and deeds of innovation in improving tools and equipment continued to emerge. Then, the secretary of the factory's Communist Youth League Committee conveyed the resolution of the National Youth Activists Congress and Chairman Mao's instructions on breaking down superstitions and liberating thought. The brilliance of Chairman Mao's great thought dispelled the clouds of self-abasement that had obscured Liang Shukai's mind, straightened his back, and emboldened him. At a Communist Youth League branch meeting, he spoke of his ideal of dyeing silk without dyes. This mythical innovation project immediately aroused great interest among the young people present and also attracted the close attention of the factory leaders. "Can it be successful?" At this time, Liang Shukai still had some concerns. But with the encouragement and support of the factory director and the secretary of the Youth League Committee, and with the assistance of the workers, on April 13, he dyed color on silk for the first time. By the end of April, he had tried dyeing eighteen different colors, and the fastness, sun resistance, washing resistance, and wear resistance had all reached the prescribed standards.
    The news of the successful experiment of dyeing silk without dyes spread throughout the factory like wind. It further broke the concept of technical mystery and shook the old theories in books and the legal process regulations. The factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League also took Liang Shukai's initiative as a banner of technological innovation and raised it high among the workers. People have set their sights on striving for the upstream and determined to "climb the peak and create miracles."
    The dull atmosphere of "ten thousand horses standing mute" has been broken, and the road to technological innovation is broad. From improving tools to eliminating processes; from saving and substituting raw materials to not using raw materials; from improving equipment to electrification and automation; from solving current production problems to climbing to the peak of world science and technology. People are becoming more and more daring to do things, and they are becoming bigger and bigger. From young people to old people, from technicians to technicians, everyone is inventing and creating.
    The truth that "the lowly are the most intelligent; the noble are the most stupid" has been confirmed once again in this factory. There are no engineers in this factory, and no one in the entire factory, including technicians and the factory director, has received higher education. Among the sixteen "model workers" with major technological innovations, seven have primary school education, three have junior high school education, and six have secondary technical school education. In terms of seniority: five have one to five years of service, seven have six to ten years of service, and four have more than ten years of service. Most of them are workers with longer seniority. These people who were called "lowly" in the old society, and those who have no learning, after the tide of the rectification movement and Chairman Mao's call to liberate thought washed away the dust that obscured the wisdom of the working people, shone brightly like unearthed pearls, and emitted immeasurable power like the splitting of atomic nuclei. After a portion of the more than 1,000 innovation proposals they put forward were officially put into production, from January to May, they had completed 43.38% of the annual leap forward plan, and the production cost was reduced by 21% compared with the same period last year. At present, the phenomenon of workers working overtime is gone. Every day after get off work, the factory is filled with gongs and drums, songs are everywhere, ball games are being played on the court, and the courtyard is filled with the Yangko dance. The young girls are rehearsing a living newspaper drama publicizing the general line in the auditorium. They live such a tense, lively, relaxed and happy life. Worker Wan Guoru wrote well in a wall poster poem:
    We are heroes standing upright,
    Daring to speak, daring to think, and daring to do.
    To the sky, we ask Chang'e to dance with us,
    To the sea, we force the Old Dragon to host a banquet;
    A breath, and the mountains collapse,
    A wave of the hand, and the river turns.
    As long as we twist into a rope,
    Overcome England,
    Why need fifteen years.

    打掉自卑感以后
    本报记者　赵玉昕
    毛主席关于破除迷信、解放思想的指示，像一把钥匙，给天津织染厂的职工打开了技术革新的大门。
    今年二十三岁，高小没有毕业，举止还带有稚气的青工张彦文，最近忽然向年近半百的技师顾贻荪提出了染布不用火碱精炼的革新建议。这个已从事印染业二十多年的老技师曾十分郑重地对他说：“这种办法不但和书本上的理论直接冲突，同时也违背国内外印染行业的实际操作经验；没有科学根据的想像，叫做胡思乱想。”但是张彦文毫不畏缩地回答：“如果我们试验成功了，科学根据不就出来了吗？”
    果然，没出二十天，张彦文这个“异想天开”的革新项目，在天津织染厂的厂长和工人们协助下，试验成功了。是什么力量鼓舞着这位年轻人敢于突破重围向书本的权威和因循的惯例宣战的呢？张彦文说：“听了毛主席的话，胆子就大了。”
    不用染料染色的首创人、青年技术员梁树楷，在叙述他的思想解放过程时，曾有如下的一段谈话：“敢想，看来很容易。其实，要把自己的理想敢于当众说出来，这要突破不少的障碍。”在四年以前，梁树楷在石家庄技术学校学习的时候，一次寒假回到了他的故乡——盛产棉花的河北省肥乡县。一个乡亲曾问他：
    “你在学校里学的什么技术？”
    “漂染。”
    “学漂染还要进学校？把白布放在染缸里一涮，就成了兰布，到咱村的大染坊里去学徒就行啦。”
    “不，我学的现代化的漂染技术，要用大机器生产，用化学方法配料，这里头的学问很大。”
    “学问再大，也要用染料呵！你能不用染料染出色布来，才算学到家咧！”
    这段半开玩笑的对话，给梁树楷以很大的启发。从此，他不止一次地想过：不用染料染布会不会成为事实呢？但他马上又否定了这个想法，认为这是一种违背科学知识的幻想，是一个美丽的神话，想想而已。1955年的冬天，他在天津织染厂化验室工作，一个同学在闲谈中告诉他：某苏联专家曾说过，羊毛纤维里含氮，如果和金属盐、亚硝酸钠偶合，使之“重氮化”，会使羊毛变色。由于好奇心的驱使，他买了一绺白毛线，趁化验室下班人静的时候，偷偷地在玻璃杯里做了次试验。“重氮化”的羊毛果然呈现出草绿和淡紫的颜色来，他兴奋得几乎叫出声来，以为不用染料染色的理想，起码在毛呢方面露出了一线希望。但是，一种自卑感的阴云立刻又蒙蔽了他的智慧。“我是个参加工作不满一年的普通的技术员，论知识不多，论经验很少，不要一瓶不动半瓶摇，凭什么能进行科学研究呢？再说，如果有可能的话，外国的科学家们早就实现了，我学习了三年也没有看见书上有过这个办法，那是一定不行了。”于是，他把试验的记录和样品，藏在自己的箱子底下，三年来他没有向任何人谈及过这件事。
    今年年初，他被批准下放到染色车间去参加劳动，每天提着染料桶，在染槽和轧染机之间穿行，看看染槽里滚动的丝绸，又泛起了一种新的念头：“羊毛是动物纤维，丝绸也是动物纤维，“重氮化”的方法用在丝绸上，会不会染出颜色来呢？”“我们染丝绸的染料大部分是进口货，很贵，如果研究成功了，能给国家节省多少的外汇？”但是，当想到：“如果提出来砸了锅”，不是更不光彩吗？勇气又消失了。3月份这个厂的职工，在党中央的号召下开展了技术革新运动，改进工具、改进设备的革新事迹，不断涌现出来。接着，工厂的共青团委书记传达了全国青年积极分子大会的决议，传达了毛主席关于破除迷信、解放思想的指示。毛主席伟大思想的光辉，驱散了蒙蔽在梁树楷心头上妄自菲薄的阴云，使他的腰板挺起来了，胆子壮起来了。在一次共青团支部大会上，他说出了不用染料染丝绸的理想。这件神话般的革新项目，立即引起到会青年的很大兴趣，也引起了工厂领导干部的密切注意。“能不能成功呢？”这时梁树楷还有若干顾虑。但是经过厂长和团委书记的鼓励和支持，经过工人们的协助，4月13日，他第一次在丝绸上染出颜色来了。到4月底他已经试染出十八种不同的颜色，而且坚牢度和耐晒、耐洗、耐磨等方面，都达到了规定的标准。
    不用染料染丝绸试验成功的消息，像风一样传遍了全厂，它进一步打破了技术神秘的观念，动摇了书本上陈旧的理论和法定的工艺规程。工厂的党政工团也把梁树楷的创举作为一面技术革新的旗帜，在职工中高高举起。人们纷纷立下力争上游的志气，下定“登高峰、创奇迹”的决心。
    “万马齐喑”的沉闷空气冲破了，技术革新的道路是广阔的。由改进工具，到取消工序；由节约、代用原材料，到不用原材料；由改进设备，到电气化、自动化；由解决当前的生产关键，发展到向世界科学技术的高峰攀登。人们越干越敢干，越干越大。从青年到老年，从技术员到技师，人人发明，个个创造。
    “卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢”的真理，在这个工厂再一次得到证实。这个厂没有工程师，连技师、厂长在内，全厂没有一个受过高等教育的人。在十六名有重大技术革新的“标兵”中，小学程度的七人，初中三人，中等技术学校的六人。从工龄上看：一至五年的五人，六至十年的七人，十年以上的四人，多数是工龄较长的人。这些在旧社会里被称作“卑贱”的人，没有学问的人，当整风运动的潮流和毛主席解放思想的号召，濯去了蒙蔽劳动人民智慧的灰尘以后，好像出土的明珠，大放光芒，好像原子核的分裂发出了难以估计的威力。当他们提出的一千多项革新建议一部分正式投入生产以后，1至5月份已完成了全年跃进计划的43.38％，生产成本比去年同期降低了21％。目前工人们加班加点的现象没有了，每天下班后，厂内锣鼓喧天，歌声四起，球场上进行着球赛，院子里扭着秧歌，青年姑娘们在大礼堂彩排着宣传总路线的活报剧。他们生活得是那样紧张、活泼、轻松、愉快。工人万国儒在一首墙头诗上写得好：
    我们是顶天立地的英雄汉，
    敢说、敢想、敢干。
    上天，请嫦娥伴舞，
    入海，迫老龙设宴；
    吹口气，高山倒，
    动动手，河转弯。
    只要拧成一股劲，
    赶过英国，
    何需十五年。
