Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, -- The Harbin Boiler Plant has adopted the method of simultaneously preparing and constructing, starting the second phase of its expansion project, originally scheduled for 1960, two years ahead of schedule.

After the completion of this expansion phase, the Harbin Boiler Plant's boiler manufacturing capacity will increase fourfold. Its boiler manufacturing level will also leap from manufacturing medium-pressure boilers to manufacturing high-pressure boilers. After the completion of the second phase, it will also be able to produce chemical equipment and petroleum equipment.

The second-phase expansion project of the Harbin Boiler Plant is very large in scale, and usually requires one to two years of preparation before construction can begin. Faced with the country's urgent need for this modern large factory to accelerate the manufacturing of medium and high-pressure power station boilers and important chemical and petroleum equipment, the plant broke with convention and decided to start expansion immediately, striving to complete the expansion within one year. In terms of construction design, the method of selecting existing drawings was adopted, and three-stage design was changed to a one-time completion. Due to insufficient manpower in the design department, the factory sent its own architectural engineering technicians to assist in the work. This shortened the design time by half a year.

    准备和施工同时并进
    哈尔滨锅炉厂提前扩建
    据新华社哈尔滨电　哈尔滨锅炉厂采取准备、施工同时并进的措施，将原订1960年扩建的二期工程提前二年在最近动工。
    这期扩建工程完工以后，哈尔滨锅炉厂的锅炉制造能力将增长四倍，锅炉制造水平，也将由制造中压锅炉跃进为制造高压锅炉。二期工程完工以后，还可以生产化工设备和石油设备。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂二期扩建工程规模很大，通常都要经过一两年的准备才能开工建设。在国家迫切需要这个现代化大工厂加速制造中、高压电站锅炉和化工、石油等重要设备的情况下，这个厂打破了常规，决定立即动工扩建，并且争取在一年之内扩建完工。在施工设计方面，采取了选用已有图纸的办法，三段设计改为一次完成。设计部门人力不足，工厂就派去本厂的建筑工程技术人员帮助工作。这样，使设计时间缩短了半年。
