Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. The wheat experimental plot cultivated by Xu Daoqing, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Pioneer Cooperative in Shenwan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, and two other young cooperative members, has created a high-yield record of 4,689 jin, ten liang, and eight qian per mu. After on-site verification by the acceptance team of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee and Gucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hao Fengwu, Secretary of the County Secretariat, and Qiu Hongxuan, Secretary of the Township Branch, confirmed through five land area measurements and two weighings that the plot was 1.7788 mu, yielding a total of 8,342 jin and three liang of wheat.

Xu Daoqing and young cooperative members Chang Shouliang and Chang Shouyuan, who cultivated this experimental plot, dared to think, act, and create, boldly conducting experiments and finally achieving success. This plot is located on the south bank of the Han River, and the previous crop was corn intercropped with cowpeas. Before planting wheat, it was plowed five times, harrowed seven times horizontally and vertically, and tilled crosswise. The plowing depth reached nine inches, and a layer of fertilizer was applied with each plowing, totaling 1,100 dan per mu. The seeding rate averaged 35 jin per mu of the superior Nanda 2419 variety, all of which had undergone yellow mud selection and Ceresan treatment. A mixed fertilizer of 40 jin of bone meal, 80 jin of sesame seed cake, and 130 dan of cattle manure was applied with the seeds. Planting took place six days after the Cold Dew solar term last year, using wide-narrow row strip planting with a row spacing of one chi and a vacant row of four cun. Topdressing was applied six times during winter and spring. The first three times consisted of 560 dan of cattle manure, night soil, and old wall soil in total, and the last three times were all superphosphate, totaling 37 jin. As a result, the wheat grew very well, with thick stalks and full grains, and no lodging occurred. There were 1.23 million ears per mu, with an average of 45 grains per ear, and some large ears had 80 to 90 grains.

These three young cooperative members are not arrogant because of the bumper harvest. In addition to actively strengthening cotton seedling management to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, they are also making all preparations for a higher wheat yield next year, striving to reach 5,000 jin per mu.

    湖北又一高产纪录后来居上
    先锋社出现亩产4689斤
    新华社武汉22日电  湖北省谷城县沈湾乡先锋社共青团分支部书记徐道清等三个青年社员种的一块小麦试验田，创造了亩产四千六百八十九斤十两八钱多的丰产纪录。经中共襄阳地委、谷城县委验收工作组、县委书记处书记郝逢武、乡支部书记丘洪宣等到场验收，五次查实地亩和两次过秤，最后证实这块地共一点七七八八亩，共打小麦八千三百四十二斤三两。
    培育这块试验田的徐道清和青年社员常守亮、常守元，敢想敢作敢创造，大胆进行试验，终于获得成功。这块地位于汉水南岸，前季庄稼是玉米夹豇豆。种麦前犁了五道，横直耙了七道，交叉整地。犁深达九寸，每犁一道就铺一层肥料，每亩计一千一百担。下种量平均每亩三十五斤南大二四一九良种，都经过黄泥选种和赛力散拌种。随种下骨粉四十斤、香饼八十斤、牛栏粪一百三十担的混合肥料。去年寒露后六天下种，采用播幅一尺、空行四寸的宽窄行条播。冬春共追了六次肥。前三次是牛栏粪、大粪、陈墙土共五百六十担，后三次都是过磷酸钙，共三十七斤。因此小麦一直长得很好，秆粗、籽粒饱满，没有倒伏。每亩有一百二十三万穗，每穗平均四十五粒，一部分大穗有八十到九十粒。
    这三位青年社员并不因为丰收而骄傲。现在他们除了积极加强棉苗管理，争取棉花也丰收以外，还正在为明年小麦更高产作好一切准备工作，争取亩产达到五千斤。
