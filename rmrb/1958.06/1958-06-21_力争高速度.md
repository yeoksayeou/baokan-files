    Strive for High Speed
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, our country's industry, agriculture, and entire construction cause are currently advancing at high speed.
    Using the highest speed to develop our country's social productive forces and realize national industrialization and agricultural modernization is the basic spirit of the General Line. It is like a red thread that runs through all aspects of the General Line. If we do not demand high speed, there is naturally no question of more, faster, better, and more economical; in that case, there is no need to exert ourselves, and there is no such thing as striving for the upper reaches. Therefore, it can be said that speed is the soul of the General Line.
    Perhaps some people think: Isn't being faster or slower just a matter of time? It doesn't affect our fundamental policy of building socialism, does it? This idea is incorrect. Yes, striving for speed is抢 time. But this is not an ordinary problem, but a fundamental policy issue.
    The superiority of socialism fundamentally lies in the fact that it liberates the productive forces from the shackles of capitalist ownership of the means of production, enabling the productive forces to develop most rapidly and without stagnation or crisis. After the socialist revolution has been basically completed, the most urgent demand of the Chinese people is to transfer the entire national economy to the track of modern large-scale production, quickly and thoroughly get rid of the poverty and backwardness left to us by history, and make our country a socialist power with highly developed economy and culture. Achieving this great goal at the highest speed in the shortest possible time is the only way to ultimately consolidate our socialist system. This is true from a domestic perspective, and even more so from an international perspective.
    Therefore, the speed issue is a matter of construction policy and a fundamental policy issue for our country's socialist cause.
    So, can we develop at high speed?
    This question is actually very clear. Everyone is familiar with the fact that we have sufficient conditions to accelerate construction. Nine million six hundred thousand square kilometers of land, all kinds of endless treasures, liberated six hundred million people, the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership, plus the huge assistance we can get from the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and the rich experience accumulated by the Soviet Union over decades, so it can be said that the conditions for galloping forward are very good.
    The conditions for accelerating the speed of construction exist objectively. The question is whether we ourselves really want to be fast and need to be fast. From 1956 to 1958, the development speed of socialist construction in our country presented a saddle shape of high-low-higher. This saddle shape fully illustrates the importance of the Party's correct policy on the issue of construction speed. Although the objective conditions were no different before and after, due to the different degrees of subjective effort, China can be two different things: one is vigorous, and the other (relatively speaking) is cold.
    The subjective initiative of the people has a very great effect, but it needs a key to start it. The General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is the key that can start the people's subjective initiative. Demanding speed is itself a powerful driving force. Isn't the current situation the best proof? When everyone wants to be fast, wants to be fast, and strives to be fast, things progress really fast. Industrial production in May this year increased by 46% compared with the same period last year; the summer grain harvest is expected to increase by about 30 billion catties compared with last year's summer harvest, an increase of about one-half. The skepticism about China's industry and agriculture being able to develop at high speed must go bankrupt at high speed in the face of such facts!
    Fast is the central link of more, faster, better, and more economical. It goes without saying that fast can be more. Although fast, good, and economical may contradict each other under certain conditions, they fundamentally promote each other. In order to be fast, we must mobilize ourselves to strive for the upper reaches, dare to think, dare to do, and dare to be original. As a result, thousands of good and economical rationalization proposals and inventions have emerged, and a series of good and economical policies have also emerged. Without the need for speed, how would they come out? Even if they did, how would they be appreciated and supported by people?
    Policy is determined by principle. With a policy of speed, there will be a policy of speed, and this policy must be a policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. The people certainly do not need policies that are more, faster, but not better and more economical, and the national strength does not allow it. For example, we cannot be content with only a few million tons of steel. We must increase steel production to tens of millions of tons in the shortest possible time. When our minds are armed with this idea, dare to imagine it, and are determined to do it, our enthusiasm and creativity are mobilized. We have to explore ways to develop the steel industry in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, because other roads are impassable. Therefore, we resolutely implement the central policy of simultaneously developing both central and local industries, and simultaneously developing both large-scale and small- and medium-sized industries. As a result, the situation has undergone a qualitative change: the requirement of "halving investment and doubling output" has been realized; more than 10,000 small- and medium-sized blast furnaces producing 20 million tons of iron and 200 small- and medium-sized converters producing 10 million tons of steel will be successively built and put into production in the coming year.
    But recall, what was it like when we did not enter a state of mobilization to increase speed, but just stepped forward according to the old rules, looking left and right, and hesitating? The machine does not start, and there is no power. As a result, not only is the speed not fast, but also the spirit of the people is not uplifted and morale is low. In that relaxed atmosphere, people are accustomed to doing everything according to the routine, their enthusiasm is suppressed, and although the masses have great wisdom and courage, they have no chance to stand out. In the world of struggle, it is like sailing against the current. If you don't advance, you will retreat. It is impossible to live in the middle reaches. Even with good conditions, people have to use and develop them. As the saying goes: running water does not become stagnant, and a frequently used hinge does not decay. Without frequent tempering, good iron will rust. Without going all out and striving for the upper reaches, even a fast-running rabbit will fall behind the tortoise because it takes a nap halfway. Similarly, if we do not become mentally tense and do not adhere to the policy of continuous revolution, none of our favorable conditions will automatically take effect. Moreover, if the east wind does not prevail over the west wind, the west wind will prevail over the east wind; if the positive factors do not develop, the negative factors will inevitably develop. In this way, the contradictions within the people will become complicated and acute, and all kinds of heresies, such as bureaucratism, lifelessness, arrogance, conceit, squeamishness, and even degenerate elements, revisionist elements, and rightist elements, will inevitably take advantage of the situation.
    From this, it can be seen that fast and slow can indeed create two completely different appearances, and the issue of fast or slow is indeed related to the destiny of the country and everyone, and related to the political atmosphere of the country and the mental state of everyone.
    The acceleration of China's socialist construction is not only beneficial to the Chinese people, but also has world significance. If we were a small country, whether we move forward faster or slower would not have a major impact on the world situation. However, we are a large country with the largest population in the world. If we do not speed up the pace of construction, we will not have fulfilled our responsibility to the socialist camp, the international proletariat, and the forces of peace in the world.
    If we were the only and newly established socialist country, and everything had to be advanced through groping, then it would be excusable for things to proceed slower. However, now we have the Soviet Union's 40 years of experience to learn from, fraternal assistance from the entire socialist camp, and we ourselves have an eight-year construction foundation. Under these superior conditions, it is unreasonable not to strive to improve the speed of socialist construction.
    All of the above shows that we should continue to go all out, aim high, and strive to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in the shortest possible time.
    Let us unify our understanding, unify our steps, work together with one heart and one mind, and move forward towards an infinitely bright future, and move forward at high speed!

    力争高速度
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，目前我国的工业、农业和整个建设事业都在以高速度前进。
    用最高的速度来发展我国的社会生产力，实现国家工业化和农业现代化，是总路线的基本精神。它像一根红线，贯穿在总路线的各个方面。如果不要求高速度，当然没有什么多快好省的问题；那样，也就不需要鼓足干劲，也就无所谓力争上游了。因此可以说，速度是总路线的灵魂。
    也许有人想：快一些慢一些，不仅仅是个时间问题吗？它并不影响我们建设社会主义的根本方针呀！这种想法是不正确的。是的，争速度就是抢时间。但是这却不是一个普普通通的问题，而是一个根本方针的问题。
    社会主义的优越性，根本上就是由于它从生产资料的资本主义所有制的束缚下面解放了生产力，使生产力能够最迅速地向前发展，能够不发生停顿和危机地向前发展。在基本上完成了社会主义革命以后，我国人民最迫切的要求，就是把我国的全部国民经济都转移到现代化大生产的轨道上去，迅速而彻底地摆脱历史遗留给我们的贫困和落后，使我国成为一个经济、文化高度发展的社会主义强国。用最高的速度在尽可能短的时间内达到这个伟大目标，才能最终地巩固我们的社会主义制度。从国内看是这样，从国际看更是这样。
    因此，速度问题是建设路线问题，是我国社会主义事业的根本方针问题。
    那末我们究竟能不能高速度发展呢？
    这个问题其实是很清楚的，大家都很熟悉我们有加快建设的充分条件。九百六十万平方公里的土地，各式各样的无穷无尽的宝藏，解放了的六亿几千万人民，党的马克思列宁主义的领导，再加上我们可以得到以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巨大援助，可以运用苏联在几十年中积累起来的丰富经验，因此可以说，快马加鞭日进千里的条件是很好的。
    加快建设速度的条件是客观的存在，问题是我们自己究竟想不想快，要不要快。从1956年到1958年的三年，我国的社会主义建设的发展速度呈现出一个前高、中低、后更高的马鞍形。这个马鞍形，充分说明了党在建设速度问题上的正确的方针的重要性。尽管客观条件前后没有什么不同，但是由于主观努力程度的不同，却可以使中国成为两个样子：一个是轰轰烈烈，一个（比较地说）是冷冷清清。
    人民的主观能动性有非常伟大的作用，但是要有一把钥匙去开动它。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，就是这把能够开动人民的主观能动性的钥匙。要求快，这本身就是一种强大的动力。当前的形势不就是最好的证明吗？当大家都想快、要快、力争快的时候，事情的进展果然就快了。今年5月份的工业生产比去年同期增加了46％；夏收粮食预计将比去年夏收增产三百亿斤左右，即增加二分之一左右。对于中国工农业能够高速度发展的怀疑论，在这样的事实面前不能不高速度地破产了！
    快，这是多快好省的中心环节。快了就能够多，这不用说。快和好省在某种条件下虽然会互相矛盾，而在根本上却也互相促进的。为了快，就必须动员起来力争上游，敢想敢干敢独创。于是，千千万万又好又省的合理化建议和发明创造就出来了，一系列又好又省的政策也就出来了。没有快的需要，它们怎么会出来呢？就是出来，又怎么会受到人们的赏识和支持呢？
    政策决定于方针。有了快的方针，才会有快的政策，而这种政策必须是又多又快又好又省的政策。多快而不好省的政策，人民固然不需要，国力也不许可。比方说，我们不能安于只有几百万吨钢，我们必须在最短的时期内，把钢铁的产量提高到几千万吨。当我们的思想上有了这种武装、敢于这样设想、决心这样干以后，我们的积极性创造性就被动员起来了。我们就不得不探求既多快而又好省地发展钢铁工业的道路，因为别的道路是行不通的。因此，我们就坚决执行中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型工业和中小型工业同时并举的政策。而这样一来，局面就发生了质的变化：“投资减一半，产量加一倍”的要求实现了；产铁二千万吨的一万多座中小型高炉，产钢一千万吨的二百座中小型转炉，在今后一年内就将陆续建成和投入生产了。
    可是回想一下吧，当我们不进入提高速度的动员状态，而只是按老规矩踏步子，左顾右盼，一步三摇的时候，事情是怎么一个样子呢？机器不发动起来，什么力量都没有。其结果，不单是速度不快，而且是人民的精神不振，意气消沉。在那种松懈的空气下，人们习惯于一切按常规办事，干劲被压抑着，群众虽有大智大勇而无出头之日。在斗争的世界中，譬如逆水行舟，不进则退，安居中游是不可能的。有了好的条件，也要人去利用，去发展。常言说得好：流水不腐，户枢不蠹。不经常磨炼，好铁也会生锈。不鼓足干劲，不力争上游，善跑的兔子也会因为半路睡大觉而落在乌龟的后面。同样，如果我们精神上不紧张起来，不坚持不断革命的方针，我们的任何有利条件也不会自动地起作用。而且，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风；积极的因素不发展，消极的因素就必然发展。这样，人民内部的矛盾就会复杂化和尖锐化，官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气，以至堕落分子、修正主义分子、右派分子的种种邪门外道，就必然乘虚而入。
    由此可见，快和慢确实会造成两种完全不同的样子，快或者慢的问题确实关系到国家的和每个人的命运，关系到全国的政治空气和每个人的精神状态。
    中国社会主义建设速度的加快，不仅有利于中国人民，而且具有世界意义。如果我们是个小国，我们前进得快一些，或者慢一些，对世界形势还不会发生什么重大影响。然而我们是一个世界上人口最多的大国，如果我们不加快建设的速度，就是我们对社会主义阵营、国际无产阶级和世界的和平力量没有尽到自己的责任。
    如果我们是唯一的和建立不久的社会主义国家，一切不得不在摸索中前进，那末事情进行得慢一些也还情有可原。然而现在我们有苏联的四十年经验可以借鉴，有整个社会主义阵营的兄弟般的援助，我们自己也已经有了八年建设的基础。在这种优越的条件下，还不努力地提高社会主义建设的速度，就是毫无道理的了。
    凡此种种，都说明我们应当不断鼓足干劲、力争上游，争取在尽可能短的时间内把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    让我们统一认识，统一步伐，同心同德，对着无限光明的未来前进，高速度地前进！
