Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th - Spurred by the general line of socialist construction, coastal islands in Zhejiang are also vigorously developing industry. In April and May, the Zhoushan Islands saw 267 newly built and expanded factories and mines put into production. Currently, over 1,100 small and medium-sized factories are under construction or planned. These factories and mines include power, shipbuilding and machinery repair, fishing net and rope making, aquatic product joint processing, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizer industry, and salt fields, distributed across many large and small islands such as Dinghai, Daishan, Putuo, Shengshan, Liuheng, and Qushan.

In the past, the industrial base of the Zhoushan Islands was extremely weak. By the beginning of this year, the entire area only had 20 small and medium-sized factories, and there were entire counties and four county towns that were blank slates. Since this spring, the Zhoushan Prefectural Party Committee has led the entire area in vigorously developing local industry, overcoming the various special difficulties encountered in running industry at sea, such as lack of water, electricity, resources, technology, and inconvenient transportation. The electricity problem has begun to be solved by utilizing the superior natural wind power and tides. The Putuo wind power station has been completed, and the Daishan tidal power station is under construction. After a large number of reservoirs were built on various islands, the water problem has been adequately solved. Many islands have also discovered rich mineral resources.

Dachen Island, which suffered a catastrophe when Chiang's troops fled, has also started many factories. The power plant began supplying electricity in early May. The Dachen Food Processing Factory and Aquatic Product Processing Factory, which use fish, shrimp, seaweed, laver, and other marine products to manufacture fish floss, shrimp paste, and fish cakes, are under construction.

### 舟山群岛厂矿林立  大陈岛上兴办工厂

　　舟山群岛厂矿林立  大陈岛上兴办工厂
    据新华社杭州4日电　在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，浙江沿海岛屿也大办工业。舟山群岛在4、5两月已有二百六十七个新建和扩建的厂矿投入生产，目前正在建设和计划建设的中小工厂尚有一千一百多个。这些厂矿包括电力、船舶机械修造、渔网渔绳制作、水产联合加工、农业机械、化学肥料工业，以及盐场等，分布在定海、岱山、普陀、嵊山、六横、衢山等许多大小岛屿上。
    舟山群岛过去工业基础极其薄弱，到今年初，全区只有中、小型工厂二十个，还有一个整县和四个县城是空白点。今春以来，中共舟山地委领导全区大办地方工业，克服了缺水、缺电、缺资源、缺技术和交通不便等海上办工业所遇到的各种特殊困难。电的问题已开始利用优越的自然风力和潮汐来解决，普陀风力发电站已经建成，岱山潮力发电站正在建设。水的问题在各个海岛建造了大批水库以后，淡水供应已经很充足。不少海岛还发现了丰富的矿藏资源。
    在蒋军逃走时曾受浩劫的大陈岛，也办起了好多工厂。发电厂已在5月初开始供电。利用鱼虾和海带、紫菜等海产制造鱼松、虾酱、鱼饼的大陈食品加工厂和水产加工厂，正在施工。
