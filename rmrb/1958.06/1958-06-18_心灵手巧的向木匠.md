    The Ingenious Carpenter Xiang
    By our staff reporter Jiang Qingzhao
    In the Yuguan town area of Wufeng County, Hubei Province, the peasants deeply respect Carpenter Xiang. They say: Carpenter Xiang is ingenious and good with his hands, able to research and create. In recent years, he has helped us create many new farm tools, making our lives better and better.
    Now, this Carpenter Xiang has brought the rice seeder he created to participate in the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition. Every day, he is so busy: sometimes standing next to the machine he created, introducing the machine's performance and efficiency to the audience, listening to the audience's comments and opinions; other times he holds a notebook, pen, and steel ruler, wandering around next to the various new agricultural tools created by others, enthusiastically inquiring, thinking, and measuring the machines with a steel ruler, then drawing sketches in his notebook. He happily said: "This is like entering a mechanical university!"
    His name is Xiang Guangzhang, he is forty-one years old, a member of the Yuguan Agricultural Tool Cooperative in Wufeng County, Hubei Province, and an advanced agricultural tool producer in the province. He has been a carpenter since he was thirteen years old, so the local people are used to calling him Carpenter Xiang. In the past two years, he has successively created eight new types of agricultural tools and imitated twelve new types of agricultural tools, most of which have been promoted and used locally.
    Creating for Current Production
    When the reporter interviewed him, he stood next to the rice seeder he created and introduced the process of creating this machine as if telling a story.
    In March this year, it was the rice transplanting season on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, the peasants in the Wufeng County area were not transplanting seedlings, but sowing seeds by hand. People first drained the water from the paddy fields, then waded through the mud, scattering handfuls of seeds, which was very laborious and inefficient, and the seeds often did not germinate for several days in the mud. The peasants said to Xiang Guangzhang: "It would be great if you could create a machine for us!" Xiang Guangzhang had long had this idea. Back at the agricultural tool cooperative, he discussed it with everyone, but no one had ever seen a seeder. What to do? The Party branch secretary called out at the meeting: "We are the arsenal on the agricultural front. If the peasants want to win the battle, they need us to supply them with weapons in a timely manner. Now that we need a seeder, we must start building it immediately, and everyone will overcome the difficulties together." Xiang Guangzhang's courage and confidence were further boosted by these words. He discussed it with everyone again, and sketched out a drawing by comparing and contrasting, and then worked with three workers to trial-produce the first seeder that night.
    The next day, they moved the machine to the field for testing, attracting many old peasants and cooperative cadres. The test failed: the machine did not run smoothly, and the sowing efficiency was even lower than manual labor. What was wrong? The old peasants found the key. They put forward useful suggestions. Xiang Guangzhang quickly returned to improve it, working through the night to transform it so that it could sow quickly.
    This good news spread immediately. In one day, eight nearby agricultural cooperatives came to order. The joy of victory encouraged Xiang Guangzhang and the workers of the agricultural tool cooperative, and they continued to work hard for four days and nights to rush out eight seeders, personally delivering them to the agricultural cooperatives to support the rice sowing work. This rice seeder is operated by two people, like a small wooden handcart moving forward in the field. Each machine can sow more than ten mu of rice per day, which is six to seven times more efficient than manual sowing, and the sown seeds are even and have a high survival rate.
    Admirable Selfless Spirit
    Before creating this rice seeder, Xiang Guangzhang had already created seven new types of agricultural tools, including a double-row corn planter, a single-row corn planter, and a tung seed shelling machine. When he created the tung seed shelling machine, he not only demonstrated his clever wisdom, but also demonstrated a selfless spirit. Tung seeds are a special product of the Dapo Laoshang Mountains in Wufeng County. Every winter, peasants go to the mountains in groups to harvest tung seeds for oil. However, the only method of shelling tung seeds passed down for thousands of years is to beat them with heavy wooden boards with nails, which makes people's backs ache and they can't beat very many in a day. Last winter, Xiang Guangzhang went to the province to attend a conference for advanced agricultural tool producers and saw a threshing machine for the first time, so he came up with the idea of creating a tung seed shelling machine. He designed the drawing on the road, and as soon as he returned to the cooperative, he wanted to start making it. However, the cooperative was short of wood at the time. After thinking about it, Xiang Guangzhang finally ran home and discussed it with his wife, and dismantled three large beams from his own wooden building to trial-produce his ideal machine. After four days and four nights of hard work, he finally succeeded. One person can easily operate such a tung seed shelling machine, and the work efficiency is two and a half to three times higher than manual labor, and the price is only sixteen yuan, which is very popular among the masses.
    "Use electricity when there is electricity, use water when there is water." This is also a line of thought in Xiang Guangzhang's inventions and creations. There is no electricity in Yuguan Town, only a small river that can run small wooden boats. Therefore, since 1956, Xiang Guangzhang has successively created "water-powered mills", "water-powered tea rolling machines" and "water-powered circular saws", so that the river water can serve the people more.
    I asked Xiang Guangzhang: "You are so ingenious, you must have created a lot of things before liberation, right?"
    He frowned and said, "In the old society, I was so worried about food and clothing that I couldn't care about that!"

### 心灵手巧的向木匠

    心灵手巧的向木匠
    本报记者　姜庆肇
    在湖北省五峰县渔关镇一带，农民们非常爱戴向木匠。他们说：向木匠心灵手巧，能钻研，能创造，这几年，他帮助我们创造了好多种新农具，使我们的日子越过越好。
    现在，这位向木匠带着自己创造的水稻播种机前来参加全国农具展览会。每天，你看他多么忙碌：一会儿站在自己创造的机具旁边，向观众们介绍着机具的性能和工效，倾听着观众的评论和意见；一会儿他拿着本子、钢笔和钢尺，在别人创造的各种新式农具旁转来转去，热心地打听着，思考着，用钢尺测量着机具，然后在本子上画下一张张图样。他高兴地说：“这次可进机械大学了！”
    他叫向光章，今年四十一岁，湖北省五峰县渔关农具社社员，省的农具先进生产者。他从十三岁就干木匠活，因此当地人民都习惯地称呼他向木匠。两年来，他先后创造新式农具八种，仿制新式农具十二种，其中大部分已经在当地推广使用。
    为当前生产而创造
    记者访问他的时候，他站在自己创造的水稻播种机旁边，像讲故事一样地介绍了创造这部机具的过程。
    今年3月里，正是长江南岸的插秧季节。可是五峰县一带的农民不是插秧，而是用手撒种。人们首先放干了稻田的水，然后跋涉在稀泥里，一把一把地撒种子，动作非常吃力，工效不高，而且种子在稀泥里往往好几天不发芽。农民对向光章说：“你能给我们创造一种机器就好了！”向光章早也就有这份心思。回到农具社里，他便和大伙研究，可是谁都没有见过播种机。怎么办呢？党支部书记在会上号召说：“我们是农业战线上的兵工厂，农民要打胜仗，就需要我们及时地供应上武器。现在正需要播种机，我们就要马上动手造，有困难大家来克服。”向光章听了这番话，勇气和信心更足了。他又和大家商量，东比西划绘起了一份图样来，并且和三个工人一起，当夜就动手试制出了第一部播种机。
    第二天，他们把这部机具搬到田里去试验，招来了许多老农民和社干部。试验失败了：机具运转不灵，播种的效率比人工还低。毛病在哪？老农民找出了窍门。他们提出了有益的建议。向光章便连忙回来改进，熬了一个通夜改造成了，可以播得快了。
    这一喜讯立刻传播开来。一天中就有附近八个农业社来订货。胜利的喜悦鼓舞着向光章和农具社的工人们，他们接着苦干了四昼夜，赶制出八部播种机，亲自送到农业社，支援水稻播种工作。这种水稻播种机由两个人操作，就像个小型木制手推车在田里前进，每部一天可播稻十亩多，比人工用手撒种的效率提高六倍到七倍，而且播下的种子均匀，成活率很高。
    舍己为公精神可佩
    向光章在创造这种水稻播种机以前，就已经创造过七种新式农具，其中有双行玉米点播机、单行玉米点播机、木梓脱壳机等。他在创造木梓脱壳机时，不仅表现了聪明的智慧，也表现了舍己为公的精神。木梓是五峰县大坡老山上的土特产，每到冬季，农民便成群结队地上山打木梓来作油料。可是千百年来相传的脱木梓壳的唯一方法就是用有钉子的重木板打，累得人腰酸腿痛，一天还打不很多。去年冬天，向光章到省开农具先进生产者会议，第一次看见了打谷机，因此他想出了创造木梓脱壳机的方法。他在路上就设计好了图样，一回到社里，便要动手制作。可是当时社里的木料缺乏，向光章想来想去最后跑回家和老婆商量好，把自家木楼上的三根大梁拆了下来，试制他理想的机器。经过四天四夜的辛勤劳作，他终于创造成功了。一个人不太费力地操作这样一架木梓脱壳机，工作效率比人工提高两倍半到三倍，而价格只十六元，很受群众的欢迎。
    “有电用电，有水用水”，这也是向光章发明创造中的一条思路。渔关镇没有电，只有一条能跑小木船的小河。因此，从1956年以来，向光章便先后创造了“水力磨”、“水力揉茶机”和“水力圆盘锯”等，让河水更多地为人民服务。
    我问向光章：“你这么心灵手巧，解放前也创造过很多东西吧？”
    他皱皱眉头说：“在旧社会，光愁吃愁穿还顾不了，谁会有这份心思啊！”
