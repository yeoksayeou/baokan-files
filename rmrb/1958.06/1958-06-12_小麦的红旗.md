The Second Production Team of the Xingfu (Happiness) Cooperative in Cuiying Township, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has raised a red flag for high wheat yield. The team's eleven mu of wheat averaged 3,215 jin per mu.

At the end of May, comrades from the acceptance team of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee and the Guanghua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party arrived at the Xingfu Cooperative in Cuiying Township.

"I heard that your cooperative has double-thousand jin wheat?" a member of the acceptance team asked.

"Well, the wheat in Team Two is growing pretty well. We estimate it at double-thousand jin, but who knows if we can actually harvest that much?" said Cui Quandian, the cooperative's director, with a smile.

Cooperative Director Cui Quandian led the comrades from the prefectural and county committees to the field, and indeed, the wheat was growing well. The members were harvesting the wheat, with wheat piles tripping them up in front and wheat bundles bumping into their backsides. Comrade Ma Shouyuan of the prefectural acceptance team said, "This is good wheat. Let's measure a plot and thresh a few bundles to try it out." The comrades of the acceptance team randomly measured one mu and two li that wasn't particularly good or bad. They counted 358 wheat bundles. They took five wheat bundles to thresh which yielded a total of 47 jin of wheat, averaging 9.4 jin per bundle. Everyone was surprised: Usually, a wheat bundle only contains about four jin of wheat, but these bundles yielded twice as much. After calculation, 9.4 jin per bundle, multiplied by 358 bundles, equals more than 3,365 jin. Who would believe that each mu could yield more than 3,000 jin of wheat? Everyone thought there must be a mistake and the threshed wheat bundles must have been unusually large. The comrades from the prefectural and county committees said, "Okay, let's thresh all the wheat from this one-mu plot!" The result was a total yield of 3,249 jin, averaging more than 3,180 jin per mu.

The news of a per-mu wheat yield of over 3,000 jin quickly spread. Zhao Xiu, the First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee, and Jiao Dexiu, the Secretary, along with the First Secretaries of Guanghua, Xiangyang, Junxian, and Yunxian County Committees, as well as agricultural scientific researchers and technicians, all came to inspect despite the light rain. Everyone came to see, and indeed, the wheat was growing very well. After on-site measurement and calculation, this one-mu plot averaged over 1.1 million spikes per mu, with each spike averaging 35.8 grains. The largest spikes had more than 130 grains, averaging more than 11,800 grains per jin, and some even had more than 8,000 grains per jin. In the words of the masses, the wheat stalks were taller than people, the large spikes were as long as centipedes, and the wheat grains were as plump as small beans. The responsible comrades of the prefectural and county committees believed that "If one mu and two li can yield more than 3,000 jin, and the eleven mu of wheat are growing similarly, they should also yield more than 3,000 jin. Therefore, all eleven mu of wheat must be threshed!" After careful single-threshing and single-weighing, the final acceptance was completed on June 8, 1958: The eleven mu of wheat averaged 3,215 jin per mu!

How did these eleven mu of land achieve a yield of 3,215 jin per mu?

This plot of land is located on a newly silted river island in the Han River, called Xiaozhuquan (Little Pig Pen) Island, which was navigable by boat before 1952. Later, members of the Xingfu Cooperative planted more than ten mu of reeds upstream, slowing down the river's flow and creating a backwater area where silt gradually accumulated. In 1953, a small island of seven or eight mu appeared. Afterwards, the reeds were expanded year by year to more than 300 mu, and the silt accumulated one or two chi deep each year. Now, it has accumulated over 400 mu of land. The soil layer is very thick, with a depth of one zhang and five chi. The soil is loose and fertile. The masses say that the soil here is like layers of fried sesame cakes. It's very fine and soft to pinch with your fingers, and the high water table makes the soil very good at retaining moisture. In the past, the masses would scatter some barley and sorghum on this island, and harvest it if they got anything, otherwise they would just leave it. Last year, the average per-mu yield of wheat here was more than 500 jin, with high-yield plots reaching more than 700 jin per mu. In the autumn, the sorghum also grew exceptionally well, reaching a height of one zhang, and yielding more than 700 jin per mu, which drew the attention of cooperative cadres and members to this land.

During last year's summer harvest, Cooperative Director Cui Quandian visited wheat fields in Guocheng and Sui Counties in the Xiangyang Prefecture, and felt very sad: "Why is it that the wheat in other places grows so well, while our cooperative, with its good natural conditions, has lower yields?" He didn't say a word during the visit, but thought to himself: "It's too late this year, but let's see next year!" After returning, he mobilized the members to summarize the summer harvest and prepare for winter sowing, determined to change some of the past bad farming habits and do a good job of winter sowing. Wang Jialin, the production team leader of Team Two, also thought: "The soil on Xiaozhuquan Island is not bad, we must plant it well this year!" In the past, they would only plow one furrow during winter sowing, and sometimes they wouldn't even plow at all. They would just poke a hole in the ground with a stick, scatter a few seeds, and that was it. Last year, they organized seven experienced plowmen to build a thatched shed on Xiaozhuquan Island and live there to plow the land. Around the Autumn Equinox, they began plowing the first furrow, plowing two and a half to three cun deep, turning the one-chi-deep artemisia (about 2,000 jin per mu) into the ground as green manure; plowing and harrowing simultaneously. They said that sandy soil has a lot of cold air, so it should be plowed deeper and dried more to warm the soil. The second furrow was plowed to a depth of five and a half to six cun. Because the oxen were weak and the plows were old-fashioned, they couldn't plow very well, and some oxen were so tired that they didn't eat grass. Some members began to make sarcastic remarks, some saying, "Why plow so deep? The crops will grow whether you plow or not." Others said, "Look how tired the oxen are, are you planning to eat beef!" They didn't waver. They plowed a third furrow during sowing, but this furrow was only two cun deep to harrow the soil into very fine particles.

They began sowing five days before the Cold Dew, and last year they all switched to the Nanda "2419" improved variety. How much seed should be sown? Team Leader Wang Jialin thought: "This year, let's make up our mind and do broadcast sowing with dense planting!" To ensure quality, all eleven mu of land were sown by him alone, averaging 32 jin of seed per mu, sowing it very densely and evenly. Some people came out to speak again: "How can the crops grow if you sow so thickly!" "This is grain! Instead of sowing so much, it would be better to distribute some to the members to eat steamed buns during the New Year." Wang Jialin retorted: "If we eat steamed buns this year, will we have steamed buns to eat next year? Don't be stingy with seeds when farming. If you're stingy with seeds, you won't harvest more grain."

As soon as the wheat seedlings emerged, they were green and lush, like rice seedlings in a paddy field, truly beautiful. In the past, there were many geese in the river island, and they ate the wheat seedlings very fiercely, cutting off a tuft with each bite. Last year, they specially dispatched two people to live in the thatched shed on the river island to watch the geese day and night. As a result, these eleven mu of wheat were not harmed by geese at all, ensuring even and full stands. The seedlings grew so densely that weeds couldn't grow, so they didn't weed, only cultivated once with a large hoe. They also didn't apply top dressing fertilizer.

Once spring arrived, the wheat grew even better. How dense was the wheat? Cooperative Director Cui Quandian told us a joke: Once, he and several other cooperative cadres went to the river island to see the wheat. They chased a rabbit out of the reeds, and when the rabbit saw the people, it burrowed into the wheat field, but was bumped back by the wheat stalks. It jumped up again, but was held up by the wheat stalks. When they went to catch it, the rabbit struggled to crawl out and ran away from another place. It is said that some members even caught two rabbits in this wheat field, because the rabbits were stuck and couldn't move in the wheat stalks.

How much could they harvest with the wheat growing so well? At first, some old farmers said that they could only harvest 700 or 800 jin. Cooperative Director Cui Quandian thought: "Last year's high-yield wheat yielded more than 800 jin per mu, and this wheat is much better, so we should be able to harvest more than 1,000 jin!" At first, the cadres estimated 1,000 jin. But Granny Xu of Team Two said: "Bragging travels the world, buying watermelon rinds doesn't cost money. If you estimate too much and harvest too little, it's just a mess!" Her words swayed the cadres, and Team Leader Wang Jialin said, "Who has ever seen 1,000-jin wheat? We don't have much confidence in estimating a yield of 1,000 jin this year." Later, the wheat headed, and it all headed out in a few days. The spikes were big and neat. When the cadres saw that the 1,000-jin mu in other cooperatives was much worse than the wheat on this plot, they estimated the yield at 1,500 jin per mu. Cui Quandian visited the double-1,000-jin mu wheat field in the Dongsheng Cooperative in Hugang Township, Guocheng County, and thought: "Our wheat on Xiaozhuquan Island is even better than that, I'm afraid it's more than 1,500 jin." He came back and discussed it with other cooperative cadres, and they raised the estimate to double-1,000-jin per mu. The cadres didn't dare to announce the estimated yield of double-1,000-jin to the masses. Later, when the masses found out, some people said: "Their mouths are flat, their tongues are round, they can say whatever they want. We'll see what they say when they can't harvest that much!"

Old Man Xu Guangyin asked Wang Jialin next to this plot of land: "Team Leader, how much do you estimate this wheat will yield?"

"2,000 jin per mu."

The old man stamped his foot: "You're talking nonsense with your eyes closed!"

After careful threshing and acceptance, Wang Jialin asked Old Man Xu Guangyin again: "What do you think?"

Old Man Xu nodded and said: "I really didn't expect it. Not only have I never seen such good wheat, but neither has my father nor my grandfather!"

No wonder. Who has ever seen wheat yielding more than 3,000 jin per mu! Who would believe it without seeing it with their own eyes?

Zhao Xiu, the First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee, other responsible comrades of the prefectural and county committees, and technical cadres all believed that it was not surprising that this eleven mu of wheat averaged more than 3,000 jin per mu. This is entirely in line with the principles of deep plowing and careful harrowing, dense and uniform sowing, sufficient base fertilizer application, mixed fertilizer application, and layered fertilizer application promoted in the past.

Everyone believed that although this plot of land was only plowed to a depth of five and a half cun, it was a newly silted river island with a very thick soil layer. After digging and inspecting the soil, the better soil was 194 centimeters (nearly six chi) deep, with twelve layers, each containing various fertilizers. Because of the deep plowing, each layer had fertilizer, and the wheat roots also grew very deep, with the deepest reaching more than 174 centimeters (more than five chi) deep. Therefore, although it was planted very densely, there was no root rot, and basically no lodging. This proves that deep plowing layer by layer and fertilizing layer by layer is a good experience.

Everyone believed that the main reason why this plot of land could produce so much wheat was that it was densely and uniformly planted, the land utilization rate was high, with more than 1 million spikes per mu, and the spikes were large with plump grains. Everyone believed that although only more than 2,000 jin of green manure per mu were applied to this plot of land, the soil of the river island was silted and accumulated from the upstream, containing many organic substances, which was equivalent to applying sufficient base fertilizer, and the mixed fertilizer was applied with good coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, so the wheat grew well.

Everyone also believed that the high water table and soil moisture of this plot of land were not affected by the drought this summer, which was also an important reason why it could produce so much wheat. This shows that turning dry land into irrigated land can also greatly increase wheat production. Everyone believed that it can be seen from this plot of land that the potential for wheat yield increase is still very large. The cadres and masses of this cooperative also believe that the production of this plot of land still has great shortcomings, such as the soil clods were not broken up enough, so the sowing was not uniform enough. The seedlings were sparse on the large clods, and the seedlings were crowded in the hollows. They are determined to create a new high-yield record of 4,000 jin per mu next year. Since this plot of land reached a wheat yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu this year, why can't it reach a wheat yield of 4,000 jin or even 5,000 jin per mu next year and the year after? Since the wheat on this plot of land can achieve such a high yield, why can't the wheat in other places achieve such a high yield?

    小麦的红旗
    湖北日报记者　孙方  本报记者　罗重璋
    湖北省光化县崔营乡幸福社的第二生产队，树起了一面小麦丰产的红旗。这个队的十一亩小麦平均亩产三千二百一十五斤。
    5月底，中共襄阳地委和光化县委验收组的同志来到了崔营乡幸福社。
    “听说你们社里小麦有双千斤？”验收组的同志问。
    “嗯，二队有块小麦长得还不错，我们估产是双千斤，谁知能打到不？”社主任崔全典笑着回答。
    社主任崔全典引导地委、县委工作组的同志到地里一看，小麦果真长得不错。社员们正在割麦，前面割麦，后面麦铺子拌腿，麦捆子撞屁股。地委验收组马守元同志说：“这好的麦子，量一块打几捆试试吧。”验收组的同志随便量了一亩零二厘不好不坏的一数，是三百五十八个麦捆，抽五个麦捆一打，共打出四十七斤小麦，每捆合九点四斤。大家都很惊奇：一般麦捆只有四斤小麦，这些麦捆要多打一倍。一计算，一捆九点四斤，三百五十八捆就是三千三百六十五斤多，说每亩能收三千多斤小麦谁相信呢？都说搞错了，打的麦捆是大个的。地委县委工作组的同志说：“好，这一亩多地的小麦通通打！”结果共打了三千二百四十九斤，每亩合三千一百八十多斤。
    亩产三千多斤小麦的消息很快传开了。中共襄阳地委第一书记赵修、书记焦德秀等负责同志和光化、襄阳、均县、郧县等县委第一书记，以及农业科学研究工作人员和技术干部都冒着细雨验收来了。大家前来一看，麦子的确长得很好。经过实地测算，这一亩多地平均每亩一百一十多万穗，每穗平均三十五点八粒，最大的穗子有一百三十多粒，平均一万一千八百多粒一斤，部分还有八千多粒一斤的。如果按群众的话说，就是麦秆有人把高，大的麦穗像蜈蚣一样长，麦粒像小豆子一样胖，地、县委的负责同志认为：“一亩零二厘能收三千多斤，十一亩小麦长的也都差不多，也应该能收三千多斤，所以这十一亩小麦要通通打！”经过单打、单秤仔细验收，在1958年6月8日验收完毕：十一亩小麦平均亩产三千二百一十五斤！
    这十一亩地的小麦是怎样争取达到亩产三千二百一十五斤的呢？
    这块地正处在汉水边的一个新淤积起来的河洲上，这个河洲叫小猪圈洲，在1952年以前还能行船。以后，幸福社的社员在河的上游种了十多亩芭茅，减缓了河水流速，造成一个回流湾，淤泥渐渐沉积下来。1953年出现了一个有七、八亩地的小洲。以后芭茅逐年扩大到三百多亩，每年淤积一两尺深，到现在已经淤积了四百多亩土地。土层很厚，有一丈五尺深。土壤疏松肥沃。群众说这里的土壤像烙的油饼一样一层一层的，用手指一捏很细，很柔和，并且地下水位高，土壤很能保墒。过去群众在这洲子上撒些大麦、高粱，收就收，不收就丢。去年这里的小麦平均亩产五百多斤，产量高的达到亩产七百多斤。秋季高粱也长得分外好，有丈把高，每亩收了七百多斤，这就引起了社干部和社员对这块地的重视了。
    去年夏收时，社主任崔全典参观了襄阳专区谷城、随县等地的小麦，心里感到很难过：“为什么人家的小麦长得这好，而我们社的自然条件好，产量反不如人家高呢？”在参观时他一句话没说，心中暗想：“今年是不行了，看明年吧！”回去后就发动社员总结夏收，准备冬播，坚决改变过去的一些不良的耕作习惯，把冬播搞好。第二队的生产队长王家林也想：“小猪圈洲的土地不坏，今年一定要种好！”过去这里冬播时只犁一道，有时连犁也不犁，用棍子往地上戳个眼子，撒上几颗籽完事了。去年他们组织了七个犁地的老把式，在小猪圈洲上搭了个茅棚子，住在那里犁地。在秋分前后开始犁第一道，犁有两寸半到三寸深，将尺把深的青蒿（每亩约有二千多斤）翻到地下作绿肥；随犁随耙。他们说沙质土壤寒气大，要耕深点，多炕一炕，土质暖和些，第二道犁到五寸半到六寸深。由于牛力弱又是旧式犁耕不动，有的牛累得不吃草。有的社员就说出怪话来了，有的说：“犁这深干么事?，这地犁不犁都长庄稼。”有的说：“看把牛累得这狠，想吃牛肉了吧！”他们不动摇。在种时又犁第三道，这道只犁两寸多深，把土耙得很碎。
    寒露前五天就开始播种了，去年通通换上了南大“二四一九”良种。播多少种子呢？队长王家林想：“今年下个决心，搞个撒播密植！”为了保证质量，十一亩地通通是他一人播的，平均每亩地撒了三十二斤种，撒得很密很匀。有些人又出来说话了：“撒这厚怎样长庄稼呀！”“这是粮食！撒这多还不如多分给社员点过年好吃馍馍。”王家林反驳他们说：“今年吃馍馍，明年还吃不吃馍馍？种田莫心痛种子，心痛种子就不能多收粮食。”
    麦苗一出来绿油油地，像秧田里的秧一样，真是好看。过去河洲里有很多大雁，吃起麦苗来很厉害，一嘴斩一蔸。去年他们专门派了两个人，住在河洲上的茅棚里，白天黑夜看大雁，结果这十一亩麦地一点没受雁害，保证了齐苗、全苗。苗子长得太密了，草也就长不起来，所以没锄草，只打一次大垡子。也没有追肥。
    一开春麦子长得更好看。到底麦子长得有多密？社主任崔全典给我们讲了个笑话：有次他和其他几个社干部到河洲上去看麦子，从芭茅里赶出来一个兔子，兔子见了人往这块麦地里一钻，被麦秆子撞了回来，又往上一跳，被麦秆子架住了。等他们上前去捉，兔子又挣扎着钻出来从别处跑了。据说有的社员在这块麦地里还捉住两只兔子，因为兔子被麦秆夹住跑不动了。
    麦子长这好能收多少呢？开始有老农说只能收七、八百斤。社主任崔全典心想：“去年高产的小麦，每亩收过八百多斤，这块小麦要好得多，总能收千多斤吧！”开始干部估了一千斤。可是二队徐婆婆说：“说大话游遍四海，吃西瓜皮不要钱买，估的多，收的少，简直是糊球搞！”她这样一说，把干部也说动摇了，队长王家林说：“过去谁见过千斤小麦呀，今年估产一千斤，的确也没有多大把握。”后来麦子抽穗了，几天就出齐了，穗子又大又整齐。干部看到别的社的千斤亩比这块地的麦子还差得多，就又估了亩产一千五百斤。崔全典到谷城参观了湖岗乡东升社的双千斤亩麦地后想：“我们小猪圈洲的一块麦子，比这块还好，恐怕不只收一千五百斤。”他回来和其他社干部一研究，又提高到亩产双千斤。干部估产双千斤还不敢向群众宣布，后来群众知道了，有人说：“嘴是扁的，舌头是圆的，他们喜欢咋说就咋说，将来收不到那多看他们再怎么说！”
    徐广银老汉在这块地旁边问王家林：“队长，这块麦子估的几多？”
    “亩产两千斤。”
    老汉把脚一跺：“闭着眼睛瞎说！”
    在细打验收后，王家林又问徐广银老汉：“你看咋样？”
    徐老汉点点头说：“真没想到，这好的麦子不光我没见到过，就是我爹我爷也没见到过！”
    这也难怪，过去谁看见过亩产三千多斤的小麦啊！不亲眼看到谁能相信呢。
    襄阳地委第一书记赵修同志和其他地委、县委负责同志以及技术干部都认为：这十一亩小麦平均每亩收到三千多斤并不奇怪。这是完全符合过去推广的深耕细耙、密植匀播、施足底肥、混合施肥、层层施肥的道理的。
    大家认为：虽然这块地只耕到五寸半深，可是这是新淤的河洲，土层很厚。经过挖土检查，较好的土壤有一百九十四公分（近六尺），有十二层，层层都含有多种肥料。由于深耕，层层都有肥料，麦子的根也扎得很深，最深的有一百七十四公分（五尺）多深。所以虽然种得很密，没有锈根，基本上也没有倒伏。由此证明层层深耕，层层施肥是个好经验。
    大家认为：这块地所以能产这多小麦，主要是种得密，种得匀，土地利用高，一亩有一百多万穗，而且穗子大，籽粒饱满。大家认为：这块地虽然每亩只下了二千多斤绿肥，可是由于河洲的泥土是从上流冲下来淤积起来的，含有很多有机物，等于施足了底肥，而且施的是混合肥料，氮、磷、钾配合得较好，因而麦子长得好。
    大家还认为：这块地的地下水位高，墒大，今夏虽然天干，也没受到影响，这也是能产这多麦子的一个重要原因，由此可见，把旱地变成水浇地也能大大提高小麦产量。大家认为：从这块地可以看出小麦的增产潜力还是很大的，这个社的干部群众也认为这块地的生产还有很大缺点，如土垡子整得还不够碎，因而播种的也还不够匀，在大垡子上苗很稀，在窝窝里苗又挤成疙瘩。他们下决心明年再创亩产四千斤的高产纪录。既然这块地在今年达到了小麦亩产三千多斤，为什么到明年、后年不能做到小麦亩产四千斤，甚至五千斤呢？既然这块地的小麦能够达到这样的高产，为什么别的地方的小麦不可能达到这样的高产呢？
