Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 19th: Norwegian Communist Party Vice Chairman Just Lippé published an article in the Norwegian Communist Party's organ "Friheten" on May 24, criticizing the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Lippé pointed out: The conflict of opinion between us Communists and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia exists not only in views on some current practical issues such as peaceful struggle, the relationship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and people's democracies, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Warsaw Pact, but also in some of the most fundamental principles and theoretical issues of the socialist movement, there are two opposing viewpoints.

Lippé wrote: Many years have passed since the last congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In these years, Yugoslavia has drawn some conclusions in its work on purely theoretical and principled issues that have distanced them from the communist movement, and the birth of its current program is somewhat special. When representatives of the entire communist movement issued the Moscow Declaration on the basic theoretical and principled issues and the main practical issues of the current world communist movement on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union in Moscow, the LCY hurriedly drafted this draft program as Yugoslavia's basic views on theoretical issues and current practical issues to confront the Moscow Declaration.

Lippé continued: "If the way this draft program was put forward is quite remarkable, then it must be said that its content is even more remarkable. Considering that this document expresses the basic views of a party that claims to lead the socialist construction of tens of millions of people, we must say that socialists find this program very difficult to understand."

Lippé pointed out: Now we must clearly recognize that many of the ideas and views in the program are not new today. The famous Yugoslav party leader Kardelj already put forward these arguments in his report to the Oslo Workers' Association in the autumn of 1954.

Kardelj once said: "Socialism in Western Europe is taking another path. It is moving in this direction, that is, by gradually strengthening the working class and thereby strengthening the political and economic position of socialism with the help of the system already established by orthodox bourgeois democracy through calm development. To what extent this or that specific policy in this regard is truly a step towards socialism can of course be discussed in each specific case, but in general, it is beyond doubt that gradual development in the direction of socialism with the help of the political machine of orthodox bourgeois democracy is not only possible in a series of countries, but is about to become a reality."

Lippé continued, Kardelj's speech attracted great attention. You must know that this was a statement by one of Yugoslavia's main political leaders. Although Tito later stated that Kardelj's speech only represented his personal views, the current program reiterates Kardelj's earlier statements about gradually developing socialism under "orthodox bourgeois democracy" and based on this, it derives some basic views, saying that the role of the state in modern developed capitalist society is different from that expounded by Marx, and that the state plays an independent role in capitalism, becoming increasingly less dependent on private capital, and also that socialist factors are growing in modern capitalist countries, thus making gradual evolutionary development possible.

Lippé said: "If we compare these arguments in the Yugoslav program with the views of today's social democratic economists and theorists, especially those of the Norwegian (Labor) Party, we will find many extraordinary similarities."

Lippé said: Shortly after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Norwegian "Arbeiderbladet" published a report on a round-table conference held by prominent internal economists of the Labor Party. This round-table conference was held in March 1956 when the Norwegian economy was in the most favorable market conditions and the stagnation of the capitalist world was replaced by certain temporary upward trends. The five Labor Party experts who participated in the round-table conference at that time claimed that it was impossible to describe how "dogmatic" and "wrong" the CPSU Congress's analysis of the development of capitalism and the possibility of a crisis in the capitalist state was. Today, these experts would not be particularly willing for others to present them with the joyful and optimistic statements they made at that time.

Lippé continued: But that is not the first thing that interests us about the round-table conference. More important is what the Labor Party economists said about the "free" capitalist world itself and its basic development. The famous Labor Party expert, Juhl, once said: "Our society has undergone tremendous development since the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, especially after the Second World War, and continues to develop at a rapid pace. We can say that we live in a transitional period. A new society is about to be built, and it is developing in the direction of socialism." Lippé continued: "This speech by the Labor Party's famous 'socialist planning' expert received widespread support from our government and the Labor Party leadership. But this is extremely similar to the above-mentioned Yugoslav statement. Kardelj's and the LCY program's views are just more generalized, more obscure, and more reserved. But other than that, there are very few differences. I think this is precisely one of the most important roots that makes the Yugoslavs' views different from those of the communist movement."

Lippé pointed out: The assessment of capitalism, the assessment of the laws of development of capitalist society, and therefore the attitude taken towards the capitalist state, the class struggle under capitalism, and the revolutionary nature of the transition from capitalism to socialism, all of this has always been and remains the basic mark that distinguishes Marxists from non-Marxists. The views of the Yugoslav party program show that it is implementing a line on the issue of capitalist development that does not develop and enrich Marxist theory, but revises it.

### 挪共副主席利佩发表文章说  南共的“国家论”跟右翼社会党观点相同

    挪共副主席利佩发表文章说
    南共的“国家论”跟右翼社会党观点相同
    新华社19日讯  奥斯陆消息：挪威共产党副主席尤斯特·利佩5月24日在挪威共产党机关报“自由报”发表文章，批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领。
    利佩指出：我们共产党人同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的意见冲突不仅存在于对和平斗争、南斯拉夫与苏联和人民民主国家之间的关系、北大西洋集团和华沙条约等一些当前的实际问题的看法上，而且在一些社会主义运动最根本的原则和理论问题上，也存在着两种对立的观点。
    利佩写道：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟上一次举行的代表大会距今已有好多年了。在这些年里，南斯拉夫在从事纯理论性的和原则性的问题的工作中得出了一些使他们远离共产主义运动的结论，它现在的这个纲领的诞生就有点特殊。当整个共产主义运动的代表在苏联建国四十周年纪念之际在莫斯科发表了关于当前世界共产主义运动对基本的理论和原则问题以及对当前的主要实际问题的基本观点的莫斯科宣言之后，南共急忙拟出了这个纲领草案来作为南斯拉夫对理论问题和当前实际问题的基本观点而与莫斯科宣言相对抗。
    利佩接着说：“如果说这个纲领草案的提出方式颇为引人注意的话，那末必须说它的内容更加引人注意。考虑到这个文件系表达一个自称领导着数千万人口的国家进行社会主义建设的党的基本观点，我们必须说，社会主义者对这纲领感到十分难解。”
    利佩指出：现在我们必须清楚地认识到纲领中的很多思想和观点并不是今天才有的。南斯拉夫著名的党领导人卡德尔1954年秋在奥斯陆工人协会所作的报告中就曾经提出过这些论点。
    卡德尔曾说：“西欧的社会主义走另一条道路。它是朝这方向走的，即它借助于正统的资产阶级民主早已建立的制度，通过平静的发展逐渐地加强工人阶级并从而加强社会主义的政治和经济地位。在何种程度上这一方面的这种或那种具体政策才是真正走向社会主义的一步，当然可以在每一个具体情况下加以讨论，但总的说来，借助于正统的资产阶级民主的政治机器往社会主义方向逐渐发展是不容置疑的，因为在一系列国家内这不仅可能，而且正要成为现实了。”
    利佩接着写道，卡德尔这次的讲话引起了极大的注意。要知道，这是南斯拉夫主要政治领导人之一的一个声明。虽然后来铁托曾声明卡德尔的讲话只是代表他个人的见解，但是现在的纲领重申了卡德尔早已谈到的关于在“正统的资产阶级民主”之下逐步地发展社会主义的说法而且基于这一点，又引伸出一些基本观点，说国家在现代发展的资本主义社会中的作用不同于马克思所阐述的那样，并说国家在资本主义中起一个独立的作用，越来越不依靠私人资本，还说在现代资本主义国家里，社会主义的因素日益增长，从而使逐步的进化的发展成为可能。
    利佩说：“如果我们把南斯拉夫纲领中的这些论点同今天社会民主党的经济学家和理论家的观点，尤其是挪威（工党）的观点相比，我们将发现很多异常相同之处。”
    利佩说：就在苏共二十次代表大会之后不久，挪威“工人报”发表了一份工党内部著名经济学家所举行的圆桌会议的报告。这个圆桌会议是在1956年3月挪威经济正处在最有利的市场条件下、在资本主义世界的停滞由某些暂时的上升趋向所替代的时候举行的。参加圆桌会议的五名工党的专家当时曾声称：无法形容苏共代表大会对资本主义的发展和资本主义国家发生危机的可能性的分析是多么“教条”和“错误”。今天，这些专家是不会特别愿意别人向他们提出他们在那时所作的喜悦和乐观的声明的。
    利佩接着说：但是我们对圆桌会议感到兴趣的首先并不是这一点。更重要的是工党的经济学家所作的关于“自由”资本主义世界本身及其基本的发展的讲话。工党的著名专家尤尔曾说：“我们的社会自十九与二十世纪交替之际起，特别在第二次大战之后，经历了巨大的发展并以一种飞快的速度继续发展着。我们可以说我们生活在一个过渡时期之中。一个新的社会正要建成，它是朝着社会主义方向发展的。”利佩接着写道：“工党这位著名的‘社会主义计划’专家的讲话受到了我国政府方面和工党的领导方面的普遍支持。但这与我们上述的南斯拉夫的声明有极大的相同之处。卡德尔和南共纲领的观点不过是比较一般化一些，比较隐晦一些，比较保留一些罢了。但除此以外不同点甚小。我认为这正是使南斯拉夫人的观点不同于共产主义运动的观点的最重要的根源之一。”
    利佩指出：对资本主义的估价，对资本主义社会发展规律的估价以及因此对资本主义国家、资本主义下的阶级斗争和对从资本主义到社会主义的革命性质等所采取的态度，这一切一向是而且仍然是区别马克思主义者和非马克思主义者的基本标志。南斯拉夫党纲的观点表明它在资本主义发展的问题上执行了一条不是发展和充实马克思主义理论，而是修正马克思主义理论的路线。
