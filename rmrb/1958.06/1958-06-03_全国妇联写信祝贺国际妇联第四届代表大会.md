Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China wrote a letter congratulating the opening of the 4th Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Vienna on the 1st. The letter is as follows: Dear Mrs. Gordon and the Congress:

    Chinese women warmly congratulate and support the convening of the 4th Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation! We extend our highest respect to you—dear Mrs. Gordon—and to all the delegates attending the conference.

    At present, the forces of the whole world that safeguard peace greatly exceed the forces of war, the national independence movement is developing vigorously, and the international situation is becoming more relaxed. We believe that this conference will surely make a greater contribution to further uniting a wider range of women to oppose war, maintain peace, defend women's rights and children's happiness, and develop friendly cooperation among women of all countries.

    We wish the conference a successful conclusion!
                   All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, May 27, 1958
