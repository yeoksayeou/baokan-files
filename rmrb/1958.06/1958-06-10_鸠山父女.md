Speaking of which, in Bailongwan Village at the foot of Pigeon Mountain in Xegou Township, Yuxian County, Henan Province, lived a family. The father, Guo Tian, was in his forties, upright and honest, and a good farmer. His daughter, Guo Xian, had just turned nineteen, was progressive in her thinking, and good at labor, and was a member of the Communist Youth League. The father and daughter got along very well, and no one thought that they would have a falling out.

One day, Guo Xian said to her father, "Our Xegou Township is going to establish a mountain management infrastructure team, and I have signed up." Guo Tian grunted with dissatisfaction and said, "Others can go, but you can't!" Speaking of old man Guo Tian, he can't be considered a backward person in Bailongwan. Since becoming a feeder in the agricultural cooperative, he has fed the livestock with all his might. Guo Tian is not unwilling to manage the barren mountains well. The farmers living at the foot of Pigeon Mountain have suffered from water and drought disasters, so who wouldn't want to manage the mountains well! In the drought of 1942, eighty-six people from Xegou Township fled the famine, and only fourteen have returned so far. After liberation, they turned over a new leaf, but they still inevitably suffer from natural disasters. Guo Tian did not allow his daughter to manage the mountains, ostensibly saying that a big girl, flying around with the young men, was not decent, but the main thing was that he did not believe that the barren mountains could be managed well, and that his daughter would suffer in vain. Based on Guo Tian's decades of experience, he felt that this era was better than any other era; the Communist Party could handle anything well. But he did not believe that he could conquer this ancient mountain of ten thousand years.

A few days later, the infrastructure team members were about to go up the mountain. Guo Xian went to ask her father again, but her father still refused. Guo Xian saw through her father's thoughts, and persuaded him in a gentle voice: "The old society did not do a single good thing for the people. Not to mention managing mountains, they couldn't even manage a small earth ridge. Now it's different. With the leadership of the Communist Party, not to mention a few small hills, even the sky can be turned upside down!" Guo Tian shook his head in disbelief. Guo Xian saw that her father's thinking was not clear, and someone outside was urging her to go up the mountain, so she became a little anxious, and said in a rough voice: "Managing the mountain is the call of the Party, I have to go even if you don't let me!" Guo Tian threatened his daughter: "You can't take my grain!" Guo Xian said: "I earn so many work points, I can't even finish eating my own grain!" These words angered Guo Tian. He stomped his foot and said, "Okay, I can't control you. From now on, don't ever step over my threshold!" Hearing her father say such heartless words, the daughter felt a pang of sadness in her heart, left the house with tears in her eyes, and went up Pigeon Mountain. From then on, a high wall was erected between the father and daughter.

Guo Xian was a clever person, and she knew that in Xegou Township, she was not the only one who did not believe that barren mountains could be managed well. She said to the team members: "The county party committee is focusing on mountain management in our township, and Pigeon Mountain is the first mountain in the county to be managed. The quality of the management will have a great impact. We must fight for a breath and manage the mountain well, and people will naturally believe us." Everyone listened and was full of energy. In order to express their determination to the Party, the infrastructure team members wrote eight large characters on the waist of Pigeon Mountain: "Make the mountains change, and ask the water for grain!" Soon, the Daquanshan Agricultural Cooperative in Shanxi Province sent three technicians, and more than four hundred migrant workers from the plains came to help build the new mountainous area. They sang: "A big socialist family, supporting the mountainous areas without any difference." Doctors, artists, barbers, cobblers, etc. in the city also came to support mountain management. Xegou Township was really shaking the mountains and moving the ground.

Several months passed. People were saying that such a big Pigeon Mountain was dug into small pits and long trenches everywhere. What are "fish scale pits" and "horizontal lines"... They can store water and grow crops. Guo Tian listened, and his heart suddenly moved: I haven't heard of these terms before. Strange! Strange! But he still didn't believe that barren mountains could be managed well.

After seven months of hard work, Pigeon Mountain was finally conquered. It was the rainy season at that time, and it rained heavily eight times in a row. People's hearts were all clenched tightly, fearing that they would suffer from floods again. However, a few days later, people were relieved again, and there was no water flowing down the mountain at all, and all the rainwater was stored on the mountain. The crops planted on the mountain also grew very well. In Xegou Township, for the first time in thousands of years, rainwater did not flow down the mountain! For the first time, barren mountains harvested crops! This strange story, like having wings, immediately spread throughout the township. Men and women, old and young, all rushed to the mountain to see the novelty. Old man Guo Tian couldn't bear it any longer, and he followed the crowd up Pigeon Mountain. He sat on a rock, watching the thousands of years of barren mountains change their appearance, and he was stunned.

Guo Tian returned home and became angry with himself. He wanted to bring his daughter back and say a few words of admission, but he was too embarrassed. This evening, the daughter happened to come back. The family sat in the yard and talked and laughed. Guo Tian felt sorry for his daughter and sat aside in silence. Guo Xian had already understood seven points, and said with a smile: "We are father and daughter, and it doesn't matter if we quarrel a few times. I'm young and don't know anything, I just make you angry." Guo Tian was overjoyed when he heard this, and couldn't say a word. (Attached picture)

　　鸠山父女
　　段荃法
    却说在河南禹县薛沟乡鸠山脚下的白龙湾村，住着一户人家。父亲郭田四十多岁，为人耿直忠厚，种得一手好庄稼。女儿郭仙刚满十九岁，思想进步，劳动又好，是共青团员。父女俩相处得很好，谁也没有想到竟会闹起别扭来。
    这一天，郭仙对父亲说：“咱们薛沟乡要建立治山基建队，我也报了名。”郭田不满意地“哼”了一声说：“人家去，你不能去！”说起郭田老汉来，在白龙湾里，并不能算是落后人。自从当了农业社的饲养员以后，把牲口喂得满身是力。郭田也不是不愿把荒山治好。住在鸠山脚下的农民，吃尽了水旱灾害的苦头，谁能不希望把山治好呢！1942年闹旱灾，薛沟乡出外逃荒的八十六人，至今才回来了十四人。解放后，翻了身，可还是免不了遭受自然灾害的袭击。郭田不让女儿去治山，表面是说，一个大姑娘家，和小伙子们在一起飞来飞去，不大像话，但主要的还是不相信能把荒山治理好，让女儿白受罪。凭着郭田几十年的经验，他觉得出来，这个时代，比哪一个时代都好；共产党什么好事也能够办得了。但他不相信，能够征服得了这万年古山。
    几天以后，基建队员们就要上山了。郭仙又去问父亲，父亲仍然不答应。郭仙看透了父亲的心思，便好言好语地劝他说：“旧社会没给老百姓办一条好事。别说治山了，连个小土岭也治不了。现在可不一样了。有共产党的领导，别说几个小山头，就是天也能翻过来！”郭田不相信地摇了摇头。郭仙见父亲思想不通，外边又有人催她上山，她有点发急了，便粗声粗气的说：“治山是党的号召，不叫去也得去！”郭田吓唬女儿说：“你不能背我的粮食！”郭仙说：“我挣那么多工分，我自己的粮食还吃不完哩！”这一句话，激恼了郭田。他一跺脚说：“好，老子管不了你。从今以后，你永远别踏我的门槛！”父亲说出绝情话，女儿心里一阵阵地难过，含着眼泪离开了家门，上了鸠山。从此，父女中间便拉起了一堵高墙。
    郭仙是个机灵人，她知道，在薛沟乡，不相信荒山能治好的并不止她父亲一个人。她对队员们说：“县委在咱乡搞治山重点，鸠山是全县第一个开始治理的山头。治的好坏，影响很大。我们要争一口气，把山治好了，人家自然就会相信我们。”大家听了，劲头十足。为了向党表示决心，基建队员们在鸠山腰间写了八个大字：“叫山变样，向水要粮！”不久山西大泉山农业社派来了三名技术员，平原地区派来了四百多名民工，来帮助建设新山区。他们唱道：“社会主义一大家，支援山区理不差。”城里的医生、艺人、理发师、补鞋匠等也都支援治山来了。薛沟乡真是闹得山摇地动。
    几个月过去了。人们传说着，那么大一个鸠山，到处挖成了小坑坑、长沟沟。又是什么“鱼鳞坑”呀，“水平线”呀……能存水，又能种庄稼。郭田听了，心里猛一动：这名词没听说过。稀奇！稀奇！可是他仍然不相信能把荒山治理好。
    苦战了七个月，终于征服了鸠山。那时正是雨季，一连下了八次大雨。人们的心都揪得紧紧的，生怕又会遭受水灾。可是，几天以后，人们都又放心了，山下根本不见有水流，下的雨水，全部都存到了山上。山上种的庄稼，也长得很好。在薛沟乡，几千年来，第一次雨水不下山！第一次荒山收庄稼！这件奇闻，像长了翅膀一样，立刻飞遍了全乡。男男女女，老老少少，都争先恐后上山看稀奇。郭田老汉再也忍不住了，他随着大伙也上了鸠山。他坐在一块石头上，看着几千年的荒山变了样，看得直发楞了。
    郭田回到家里，生起自己的气来。他想把女儿找回来，说句输理话，但又不太好意思。这天晚上，女儿恰巧回来了。一家人坐在院子里说笑起来。郭田觉得对不起女儿，坐在一旁不吭声。郭仙早有七分明白，便笑着说：“亲父子爷们，吵几句嘴也算不了啥。我年轻，不懂事，光惹您生气。”郭田一听，心里乐滋滋的，一句话也说不出来。（附图片）
