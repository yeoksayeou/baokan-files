Grasp Summer Harvest with One Hand, Winter Planting with the Other
    Hebei Province Proposes Methods and Requirements for Striving for a Greater Summer Harvest Next Year

    (Our dispatch) The Hebei Province Summer Harvest, Summer Planting, and Summer Distribution Work Conference, recently convened, preemptively studied and arranged the planned planting tasks and requirements for the province's 1959 summer harvest crops.

    The province has preliminarily decided: in 1959, it plans to plant 60 million mu of summer harvest crops, mainly winter wheat and spring wheat, an increase of over 44% compared to the actual planted area of summer harvest crops this year; the planned total output should reach 24 billion jin, a twofold increase compared to the planned total output of summer harvest crops this year, equivalent to 96% of the province's planned total grain output this year.

    The conference pointed out: The tense summer harvest and summer planting season in Hebei Province is about to arrive. While resolutely carrying out this year's summer harvest, summer planting, and summer distribution work, all localities must proactively make a series of preparations for striving for a greater harvest of summer harvest crops next year.

    The conference studied the methods and measures for striving for a large summer harvest next year. It proposed: The wheat fields to be planted this autumn and next spring should all become irrigated land, ensuring water is available whenever needed, and the practice of shallow irrigation with small amounts of water should be universally implemented, making irrigation, cultivation, and technology like gardening; this summer, the movement for accumulating fertilizer should be continued on a large scale, creating conditions for striving to apply 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu of wheat; all wheat fields should be deeply ploughed, and those with conditions should be deeply ploughed to more than one chi; during this year's summer harvest, a sufficient quantity of high-quality seeds should be selected and properly stored, so that all wheat fields planted this autumn and next spring can be appropriately sown early, universally use improved varieties, and increase the amount of sowing, etc.; other aspects such as agricultural tool reform, prevention of diseases, pests, wind, frost, and lodging, and the promotion of scientific management measures should all be properly carried out in a timely manner to ensure the completion of next year's summer harvest crop planting tasks with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　一手抓夏收  一手抓冬播
    河北省提出争取明年夏季更大丰收的办法和要求
    本报讯  最近召开的河北省夏收、夏种、夏分工作会议，提前研究和布置了这个省1959年夏收作物的计划种植任务和要求。
    这个省初步决定：1959年计划种植以冬小麦、春小麦为主的夏收作物六千万亩，比今年夏收作物实际播种面积增加44％强；计划总产量要达到二百四十亿斤，比今年夏收作物计划总产量提高两倍，等于今年全省计划粮食总产量的96％。
    会议指出：河北省紧张的夏收、夏种季节就要到来。各地在坚决作好今年夏收、夏种、夏分工作的同时，必须提前主动地作好力争明年夏收作物更大丰收的一系列准备工作。
    会议研究了力争明年夏季大丰收的办法和措施。提出：今秋、明春要种的麦田应该全部成为水浇地，作到何时要用水何时就有水，并要普遍实行小水浅浇，灌溉、耕作、技术园田化；今年夏季要继续大搞积肥运动，为力争种小麦亩施底肥二万斤创造条件；全部麦田实行深耕，有条件的要深耕一尺以上，今年夏收中要选留足够数量的优良种子，妥善保存，以便作到今秋、明春种的全部麦田适当早播、普遍使用优种、增加播种量等；其他农具改革，防病、防虫、防风、防霜冻和防倒伏，推行科学管理措施等，都应适时作好，保证多、快、好、省地完成明年夏收作物的种植任务。  （邓子常）
