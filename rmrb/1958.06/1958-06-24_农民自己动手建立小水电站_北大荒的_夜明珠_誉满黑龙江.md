Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd: The small hydropower station built by peasants of the Xi'an Cooperative in Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, has become a model for realizing rural electrification throughout the province. The Provincial Water Conservancy Department recently held a short-term training course to train 10,000 technical cadres to go deep into the countryside to promote this experience, requiring the province to realize mechanization in rural areas within one year and electrification within three years.

The small hydropower station of the Xi'an Cooperative in Ning'an County was built by the local masses using "native methods" several years ago. It is deeply loved by the masses and is known as the "Pearl of the Night" in Beidahuang. The advantages of this hydropower station are: simple and easy to use, low cost, and great effect. Arriving at the hydropower station, you can't see a tall dam or a magnificent factory building. Only a stream of water is drawn from the Hailang River beside the village, flowing along a channel to the power station. The factory building is two ordinary thatched houses. Utilizing the natural drop of the channel, the water impacts the "double-impact" iron water turbine, driving a 15-kilowatt generator to generate electricity. This hydropower station, from surveying, design, construction to machine installation and production, was all done by the masses themselves; except for the generator, all the equipment was also manufactured by the masses themselves. The construction of this hydropower station cost more than 10,000 yuan, and the cost of generating each kilowatt of electricity is more than half lower than that of the relatively large power station built in the neighboring county.

The simple hydropower station has brought mechanization and semi-mechanization to the non-field labor of the Xi'an Cooperative. On the one hand, the hydropower station uses water turbines as power to mechanize operations such as grain and rice processing, cotton ginning, and firewood sawing. On the other hand, it uses electricity to drive threshing machines, rice hullers, and chaff cutters.

With electricity, the lives and thoughts of the masses have also changed. The idea of many young people being uneasy with rural work and yearning for the city has changed; some farmers' ideas of moving to the suburbs of Mudanjiang to farm have also been dispelled.

This hydropower station has seven months (May to December) of operation time each year. This period coincides with the busy farming season, and labor is particularly tight. After the mechanization of non-field cultivation with electricity, a large number of laborers were liberated, which is just suitable for the characteristics of Heilongjiang Province, which has a large land area, a small population, and a shortage of labor. In the five months when hydropower cannot be used, they use diesel engines as power. The electricity bill collected by the hydropower station from supplying users with electric lights each year can compensate for the fuel cost of the diesel engine and have a surplus.

In recent days, many places have sent cadres to visit and study at this hydropower station, and the provincial leadership department will hold an on-site meeting here.

### 农民自己动手建立小水电站  北大荒的“夜明珠”誉满黑龙江

    农民自己动手建立小水电站
    北大荒的“夜明珠”誉满黑龙江
    据新华社哈尔滨22日电  黑龙江省宁安县西安合作社农民自办的小型水电站，已经成为全省实现农村电气化的典范。省水利厅最近举办短期训练班，训练一万名技术干部，深入农村推广这项经验，要求在全省农村里一年实现动力化，三年实现电气化。
    宁安县西安合作社的小型水电站，是当地群众几年前用“土办法”办起来的，深受群众爱戴，被称为北大荒里的“夜明珠”。这个水电站的优点是：简单易用，花钱少，起的作用大。来到水电站，既看不到高大的拦河坝，也看不到雄伟的厂房，只是从村旁海浪河里引出一股水，沿着渠道流向电站，厂房是两间普通的草房。利用渠道的自然落差，水冲击着“双击式”铁水轮，带动了十五瓩发电机，发出电流。这个水电站，从勘查、设计、施工到机器安装、生产，都是群众自己干的；除了发电机外，全部设备也是群众自己制造的。建设这座水电站投资一万多元，它发每一瓩电的成本费比邻县建筑的比较大的电站低一半以上。
    简陋的水电站给西安合作社的非田间劳动带来了机械化和半机械化。水电站一方面以水轮作动力，使粮米加工、弹棉和火锯等作业机械化，另一方面，利用电力带动打场机、脱谷机和铡草机。
    有了电以后，群众的生活和思想也发生了变化。许多青年不安心农村工作、向往城市的思想有了改变；一些农民打算搬到牡丹江市郊区种地的想法也打消了。
    这个水电站一年有七个月（5至12月份）的运转时间，这段时间恰值农忙季节，劳动力特别紧张，用电力带动了非田间耕作机械化后，就解放了大批劳动力，恰恰适合黑龙江省地多人少、劳动力不足的特点。在不能用水力发电的五个月中，他们用柴油机作动力。水电站每年供应用户电灯所收的电费，就可以补偿柴油机燃料费用而有余。
    这些天来，许多地方派干部到这个水电站参观学习，省的领导部门将在这里召开现场会议。
