　　Japan's Overseas Markets Are Increasingly Narrow
    Exports of Chemical Fiber Products and Steel Products Plummet
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: Japanese trade figures released on the 2nd indicated that Japan's exports of chemical fiber products in May fell to their lowest level in more than a year.

    Trade figures indicate that in May, Japan exported only 35 million yards of rayon fabrics and 75 million yards of rayon fiber products, the lowest monthly figures since June of last year and February of last year, respectively. They believe that the reasons for the sharp decline in exports of these two types of textiles are: the price of Japanese chemical fiber products in the domestic market began to rise sharply in April and has continued to fluctuate since then, so foreign buyers are waiting to see; secondly, Southeast Asian countries lack foreign exchange, and some East African countries have adopted measures to increase tariffs and restrict imports.

    Trade figures concede that the difficult situation for Japanese chemical fiber product exports will continue.

    In addition, according to a recent "Asahi Shimbun" report, sales of Japanese steel products have also further deteriorated recently, with prices plummeting. In view of the fact that steel companies are not complying with production reduction regulations, and the prospects for steel product exports are not optimistic, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the steel industry decided on May 23 to reduce the production of medium-sized steel by half starting in June, and decided that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the steel industry would jointly establish a production reduction supervision committee to strictly supervise steel companies to implement the production reduction decisions.

### 日本国外市场日益狭窄  化学纤维制品和钢铁制品出口激减

　　日本国外市场日益狭窄
    化学纤维制品和钢铁制品出口激减
    新华社3日讯  东京消息：日本贸易界人士在2日说，日本5月份的化学纤维制品的出口额跌到一年多以来最低的水平。
    贸易界人士说，在5月份，日本只输出人造丝织品三千五百万码和人造纤维制品七千五百万码，分别是去年6月和去年2月以来最少的一个月。他们认为，这两种纺织品出口激减的原因是：日本化学纤维制品在国内市场上的价格在4月份开始猛涨，此后继续波动，因此国外买主都在观望；其次是由于东南亚国家缺乏外汇，同时东非一些国家采取提高关税和限制进口的措施。
    贸易界人士承认，日本化学纤维制品出口困难的情况还要继续下去。
    另据“朝日新闻”最近报道，日本钢铁制品的销售情况最近也进一步恶化，价格暴跌。日本通商产业省和钢铁业界鉴于钢铁企业不遵守减产的规定，钢铁制品出口的前景也不容乐观，因此在5月23日决定从6月开始把中型钢的产量减少一半，并且决定由通商产业省和钢铁业界共同建立一个减产监督委员会，来严格监督钢铁企业执行减产的决定。
