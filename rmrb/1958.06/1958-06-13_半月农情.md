    Half-Monthly Agricultural Situation
    "Small Full" (May 21) - "Grain in Ear" (June 6)
    During the half-month from "Small Full" to "Grain in Ear," the major wheat-producing areas are in the peak harvest season. Before "Grain in Ear," winter wheat in the southern regions has been basically harvested; Anhui, northern Jiangsu, southern Shanxi and Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong and other places have entered the peak wheat harvesting period; Winter wheat in northern Hebei and along the Bailong River in Gansu is ripening, and widespread harvesting will begin after "Grain in Ear."
    This year, the progress of wheat harvesting in various regions has been generally rapid. Dengfeng County, Henan, rushed to harvest all the ripe wheat in one day and night. Some areas in Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces encountered rain during the wheat harvest this year, but were not damaged.
    Wheat-producing areas with earlier seasons generally combine wheat harvesting with summer planting. Henan Province, which has made faster progress, had sown 16.9 million mu of summer crops before "Grain in Ear." Judging from the situation in this stage, the characteristics of this year's summer planting are: early, fast, and meticulous.
    Rice transplanting in northern regions gradually entered its peak period after the end of May. Before "Grain in Ear," most of the spring rice in the Yellow River and Huai River basins had been transplanted, and the early-transplanted spring rice had begun to turn green. In some arid areas of the Yellow River and Huai River basins, the transplanting of spring rice was delayed due to insufficient water sources. Some new rice areas in Hebei, Shandong and other provinces only began transplanting at the end of May.
    Rice in Northeast China and Xinjiang also began to be transplanted or sown during this half-month. Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin, began transplanting on May 16. Some agricultural cooperatives in Heilongjiang and most rice-growing areas in Liaoning also transplanted rice during this stage. Rice sowing in southern Xinjiang ended in mid-May, and rice in northern Xinjiang also began sowing during the same period.
    Early rice in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin has generally entered a stage of intense field management. In many areas, there was excessive rainfall in mid-to-late May, and some early rice was adversely affected by the rain, with seedlings turning yellow and weak. Eliminating third-class seedlings is an important agricultural activity in these areas. In order to turn third-class seedlings into first and second-class seedlings, Shaoyang Prefecture in Hunan Province mobilized 800,000 people every day to cultivate, topdress, replant missing seedlings, and eliminate pests. The general line of building socialism has also become a huge force in promoting this agricultural activity. Encouraged by the general line, agricultural cooperative members in Fuzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi, quickly managed more than 600,000 mu of third-class seedlings.
    Most of the early rice south of the Nanling Mountains is nearing maturity, some has matured, and a small amount has begun to be harvested. Before the large-scale harvest of early rice, these areas will also be subjected to natural disasters such as pests, diseases, floods, and typhoons. Agricultural cooperatives in these areas have already taken actions to prevent these disasters.
    The sowing of late rice seedling fields in the southern regions has basically ended, and some early-sown areas have begun seedling field management.
    In order to meet the fertilizer needs for the next stage, many regions have launched summer fertilizer accumulation activities during the busy farming season. In Huiyang Prefecture, Guangdong, where 500,000 people are involved in fertilizer accumulation, 630 million dan of fertilizer had been accumulated by May 20, with an average of 100 dan of fertilizer available per mu of late rice field. Counties in Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan, have launched a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign under the call of accumulating 1,000 loads of fertilizer per household. In the few days from May 22 to May 29, Nanbu, Nanchong, Yuechi, Guang'an, Wusheng and other counties in this prefecture had an average of 700 to 800 loads of fertilizer accumulated per household in more than 330 cooperatives, and a few cooperatives had reached the target of 1,000 loads.
    This year, many regions have a strong momentum in summer fertilizer accumulation, and the quality of accumulated fertilizer is relatively good. This is another new atmosphere in this year's summer production.

    半月农情
    “小满”（5月21日）——“芒种”（6月6日）
    “小满”到“芒种”这半个月里，正是主要麦产区收获高潮阶段。在“芒种”以前，南方地区的冬麦已基本收完；安徽、江苏北部，山西、河北南部，河南、陕西、山东等地进入收麦盛期；河北北部、甘肃白龙江两岸的冬麦正在黄熟，普遍开镰将在“芒种”以后。
    今年各地收麦进度普遍迅速。河南登封县一昼夜抢收了全部成熟的小麦。河南、陕西等省的一些地区，在今年收麦期间虽然遇到阴雨，但是没有受到损害。
    季节偏早的产麦区，普遍结合收麦进行夏种。进度较快的河南省，在“芒种”以前已播下一千六百九十万亩夏播作物。从这一阶段情况看，今年夏播的特点是：早、快、细致。
    北方地区的水稻插秧，从5月下旬以后逐渐进入盛期。“芒种”以前，黄淮流域的春稻已大部插下，早插的春稻已开始转青。黄淮流域部分干旱地区，因水源不足推迟了春稻的插秧期。河北、山东等省的一些新稻区，有些在5月底才开始插秧。
    东北地区和新疆等地的水稻，也在这半个月里开始插秧或播种。吉林延边朝鲜族自治州由5月16日起开始插秧。黑龙江部分农业社和辽宁大部水稻区也在这个阶段插了秧。南疆水稻在5月中旬结束播种，北疆的水稻也在同一时期开始播种。
    长江流域各省的早稻，普遍进入紧张的田间管理阶段。不少地区5月中、下旬雨水过多，部分早稻因雨受到不利影响，禾苗黄弱。消灭三类禾苗是这些地区的一项重要农事活动。湖南邵阳专区为了使三类禾苗转为一、二类禾苗，每天出动八十万人中耕、追肥、补蔸、除虫。建设社会主义总路线也成了推动这项农事活动的巨大力量，江西抚州地区的农业社员，在总路线的鼓舞下，迅速地管理了六十多万亩三类禾苗。
    五岭以南地区的早稻大部接近成熟，部分已经成熟，少数开始收割。在大规模收获早稻以前，这些地区还会遭受虫、病、洪水、台风等自然灾害。这些地区的农业社已经有了防范这方面灾害的行动。
    南方地区的晚稻秧田播种已基本结束，部分早播的地区，已开始秧田管理。
    为了满足今后一个阶段的肥料需要，许多地区在繁忙的农事季节里开展了夏季积肥活动。五十万人投入积肥的广东惠阳专区，到5月20日已积肥料六亿三千万担，晚稻田每亩平均已有百担肥料可施。四川南充专区各县，在每户积肥一千挑的号召下掀起夏季积肥热潮。在5月22日到5月29日的几天中，这个专区的南部、南充、岳池、广安、武胜等县，已有三百三十多个社平均每户积肥七、八百挑，少数社已达到一千挑的指标。
    今年许多地区夏季积肥的劲头很大，所积肥料质量较好。这是今年夏季生产中的又一新气象。
