    Xinjiang Builds Large Hydropower Station
    (By our newspaper) A large hydropower station, currently the largest in Xinjiang, is being built in the northern part of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region – the Koktokay Large Hydropower Station. This large hydropower station will have a generating capacity of 12,000 kilowatts.
    This project is being undertaken by a regiment of the Construction Engineering Department of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps. To ensure timely construction, this regiment began preparations as early as November of last year.
    Now, the support armies from Urumqi and Karamay have successively arrived at the construction site. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, the builders are ensuring the completion of the three-year task in two years, striving to start delivering electricity by October 1st next year.

    新疆兴建大水电站
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区北部兴建一座目前新疆最大的水力发电站——可可托海大水电站。这个大水电站发电量为一万二千瓩。
    这项工程由新疆军区生产建设兵团建筑工程处某团担任，为了保证按时施工，这个团早在去年11月就开始做准备工作。
    现在，乌鲁木齐和克拉玛依的支援大军已经陆续开到工地。在跃进的高潮中，建设者们保证三年任务二年完成，争取明年10月1日开始送电。　（邹富卿）
