    Success Depends on Human Effort, Land Depends on Human Cultivation
    Shen Shi
    The Zhaoyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is taking measures to change the low-yield appearance of the upland areas. Zhaoyang County, Hubei Province, has 2.18 million mu of cultivated land, of which 1.32 million mu are upland areas. The upland soil is poor, and the yield of crops has been low for years. Farmers have little confidence in cultivating upland areas, saying things like, "Three days of rain, a complete mess; three days of sunshine, like a knife; plowing makes you cry, harrowing makes you scorched, weeding makes your heart race." Some cadres also do not pay attention to the management of upland areas, believing that "river land can leap forward, but upland cannot leap forward."
    However, this year, the Suiyang Agricultural Cooperative in the county planted more than 1,000 mu of wheat on upland, and the appraised yield was an average of 530 jin per mu. The Chenguang Agricultural Cooperative in Huigang Township has poor soil quality, but the 20 mu of wheat cultivated by Zhang Zhengyao, the women's director of the cooperative, had an appraised yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu.
    The Zhaoyang County Committee analyzed this situation and believed that "success depends on human effort, and land depends on human cultivation." In order to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu of wheat in the county, it is necessary to pay attention to the management of upland areas and tap the potential for increased production. The County Committee recently held an on-site meeting of the District Committees and Township Branch Secretaries in the upland areas, citing examples of high and low yields in the upland areas, and criticized the incorrect understanding that "upland has poor soil quality, large area, bad conditions, little fertilizer, and little labor force, so it cannot leap forward." The County Committee put forward the slogan "Fight a hundred-day battle on the upland, transform low yield into high yield, liberate thinking and break with conservatism, achieve 100 jin of ginned cotton and 1,000 jin of grain, tap potential and transform nature, the upland must also catch up with the plain." The county has established a special team for upland production. The first secretaries of the county, districts, and townships personally take charge of upland production. All districts and townships in the upland areas have taken action. Yan Gang Township organized agricultural cooperatives to establish nine factories to improve agricultural tools. All the old plows in the township have been converted into seven-inch walking plows. Yi Zhuang Township's Jianguo Cooperative has established pig farms and livestock farms in places far from the village to accumulate fertilizer locally. The county's agricultural tool factory is rushing to produce 35,000 seven-inch walking plows and has signed processing contracts with various townships and cooperatives. As long as the county consistently grasps this matter to the end, the appearance of the upland areas will be rapidly changed.

    事在人为，地在人种
　　沈石
    中共枣阳县委正采取措施，来改变岗地的低产面貌。湖北枣阳县耕地面积二百一十八万亩，其中有一百三十二万亩是岗地。岗地土质差，农作物历年产量低，农民耕作岗地信心不高，说什么“下雨三天一团糟，天晴三日像把刀，犁地哭，耙地焦，锄草急的只心跳”。一部分干部也不重视岗地的经营管理，认为“河地能跃进，岗地不能跃进”。
    可是今年这个县的随阳农业社，种植在岗地的一千余亩小麦，鉴定产量每亩平均五百三十斤；惠岗乡晨光农业社土地质量差，而这个社的妇女主任张正瑶培育的二十亩小麦，鉴定产量每亩达一千余斤。
    枣阳县委分析了这种情况，认为“事在人为，地在人种”。要想使全县小麦平均亩产千斤，一定要重视岗地的经营管理，发掘岗地的增产潜力。县委最近召开了岗地区委和乡支部书记的现场会议，举出岗地丰产和低产的事例，批判了“岗地土质差，面积大，条件坏，肥料少，劳动力少，不能跃进”等不正确的认识，县委提出了“大战岗地一百天，低产也要变高产，解放思想破保守，皮棉百斤粮一千，挖掘潜力，改造自然，岗地也要赶平原”的口号。全县成立岗地生产的专门班子。县、区、乡的第一书记亲自抓岗地生产。各岗地区乡均已行动起来，阎岗乡组织农业社成立了九个改进农具的工厂，全乡的旧犁已改成七寸步犁，意庄乡建国社，在离村庄较远的地方，已建立养猪场和畜牧场，就地积肥。县农具厂赶制七寸步犁三万五千部，并和各乡、社订了加工合同。全县只要始终如一地抓到底，岗地的面貌是会迅速改变的。
