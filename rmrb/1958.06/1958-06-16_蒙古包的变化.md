Changes in the Mongolian Yurt
By Our Correspondent Feng Ye

Early summer sees the grasslands adorned in new green attire. In the vast pastoral areas, white Mongolian yurts are often seen in groups of seven or eight, or even ten or more, scattered among the grasses, resembling clusters of blooming mushrooms or white flowers woven into a green carpet. Whenever the livestock need to be moved to another pasture, these yurts are dismantled, loaded onto carts or the backs of camels, transported to another green grassland, and then re-erected.

In winter, people choose sheltered places to settle their homes. At this time, ice and snow cover the grasslands, and more yurts are clustered together. The felt coverings are thickened, fires are frequently lit inside, and wisps of white smoke rise from the iron chimneys on the yurt tops.

The circular, ancient Mongolian yurt has been passed down through generations. The yurt's exterior has not changed much, but the white felt covering the yurt, the furnishings inside, and the lives of the yurt's inhabitants have undergone great changes.

Tsetserleg, in the western part of the Mongolian People's Republic, known as the "Garden" city, is the capital of the Arkhangai Province, surrounded by mountains, rivers, and forests, with beautiful scenery. Traveling south from Tsetserleg, crossing the clear waters of the Tamir River, you can reach a lush grassland. Here, we visited the herder, Xia Nabu. He greeted us warmly at the entrance of his yurt.

The small door of the Mongolian yurt always faces south, allowing sunlight to stream into the dwelling. The "tono" (the circular window installed at the top of the yurt) is fully open, making it very cool inside.

This is an ordinary herder's family. The furnishings inside are clean and tidy. The floor is covered with felt, and at the far end are two wooden cabinets, one containing a small leather suitcase, and the other topped with a mirror, face cream, and other items. Many photographs and pictures are hung around the yurt. To the right is an iron bed, on which are folded quilts and blankets. On either side of the entrance are pieces of furniture and leather bags filled with mare's milk. An iron stove stands in the center of the yurt, with the chimney extending outside through the window.

The hospitable host brought out milk curds, milk tofu, and other foods to treat us. This is the season for producing mare's milk, and Xia Nabu served each of us a large bowl. Mare's milk is the best drink in summer, slightly sour and very refreshing. Having traveled all morning, we were thirsty, and the mare's milk was very satisfying.

Xia Nabu lives at home only with his wife and youngest daughter. His eldest son works in the provincial health department. Xia Nabu told us that he joined the cooperative more than a year ago. His original one hundred or so livestock were entered into the cooperative, but he kept dairy cows, horses, and several sheep at home. He said that the cooperative has more people and greater strength, and everyone works together to manage the livestock, which has reduced the mortality rate. Every year, he receives milk, meat, and cash according to his work points, and his family lives very well.

Xia Nabu also told us that their cooperative is preparing for settlement work. He said that the changes since the Mongolian revolution have been tremendous, and the lives of herders are changing day by day. After the herders settle down, new prospects will emerge in production and life.

Xia Nabu's words reminded me of the Tamsagbulag Farm, which we visited last winter when it was frozen with ice and snow, and of the old haymaking worker of this farm, Bulagde.

Old Bulagde has lived through two different eras and has a deep understanding of the different lives in the old and new societies. Before the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, he was a young man of eighteen or nineteen, living the oppressed and impoverished life of a herder. He told us that at that time, in the grassland where he often grazed, several dilapidated and dark yurts housed herders who had no livestock of their own and grazed the cattle and sheep of feudal lords. On freezing nights, the inside of the yurt was pitch black, and the herders could only wrap themselves in ragged sheepskins to endure the long winter nights. Life then was: "Feast for a while, feast during the New Year; eat meal by meal, feast when slaughtering a cow." This meant that in the past they were often unable to get enough to eat, and only during the New Year or when a cow was slaughtered could they eat a full meal.

Bulagde is now an excellent haymaking expert on the farm, earning more than 200 tugriks a month. His son is a horse herder. Father and son each live in a large Mongolian yurt. Their current lives and the hardships experienced by Bulagde in his youth are as different as heaven and earth. Now, the iron beds, sewing machines, blankets, and other items in their yurts are things that the older generation could never have dreamed of. Also, the yurts are now brightly lit with electric lights in the evenings, whereas decades ago, it was pitch black at night. Bulagde said, what else could this be but an earth-shaking change?

The changes in the Mongolian yurt and the lives of the herders are indeed great. The herders are now living happy lives and working hard to build their country. Old Bulagde's words express the feelings of millions of herders. He said: "We have no worries in our lives now, and the important issue now is how to improve production and increase the number of cattle and sheep faster."

### 蒙古包的变化

    蒙古包的变化
    本报记者　逢烨
    初夏，草原换上绿色新装。在广大牧区，白色蒙古包常常是七、八个，十来个成群地分布在草丛中，就像一团团盛开的菌子，又像绿色地毯上织出的朵朵白色鲜花。每当牲畜需要转移牧场的时候，这些蒙古包就拆卸下来，装到车子上或放在骆驼背上，运到另一块绿色的草原，然后再把它架设起来。
    到了冬天，人们选择避风的地方来安置自己的家园。这时，冰雪封盖着草原，较多的蒙古包密集在一起，毡子加厚了，屋里经常燃着火，包顶上的铁烟囱口冒着缕缕白烟。
    圆形的古老的蒙古包，一代代地被流传下来。蒙古包的外形没有多少改变，但是，铺在蒙古包上的白毡子，蒙古包内的陈设，以及蒙古包的主人的生活，却发生了很大的变化。
    蒙古人民共和国西部的被称作“花园”城市的策策尔勒格，是后杭爱省的省会，四周有山、有水，还有森林，风景很美。从策策尔勒格往南行，经过水流清澈的塔米尔河，就可到达一片水草丰茂的草原。我们在这里访问了牧民夏那布。他在蒙古包的门口热情地接待了我们。
    蒙古包的小门总是向南开的，阳光从这里射进屋子。蒙古包顶上的“托诺”（安放在包顶上的圆形窗户）完全敞开，里面很凉爽。
    这是一个普通牧民的家庭。家里的陈设，干净整齐。地下铺着毡子，上端有两个木柜，一个放着小皮箱，另一个柜上有镜子、雪花膏等，四周挂着许多照片和图片。右边是一张铁床，上面叠着棉被和毯子。进门的两边，放着家具和盛装马奶的皮口袋。铁炉子放在蒙古包的中央，烟筒通过窗户伸出蒙古包外。
    好客的主人，把奶干、奶豆腐等食品拿来招待我们。这正是盛产马奶的季节，夏那布给我们每人盛了一大碗马奶。马奶是夏天最好的饮料，微带酸味，喝下去很清凉。今天我们已经赶了一上午的路程，口正渴，喝下马奶，十分舒畅。
    夏那布家里只有妻子和小女儿，大儿子在省里的卫生科工作。夏那布告诉我们，他加入合作社已经一年多了，自己原有的一百多头牲畜入了社，家里还留着奶牛、马和几只绵羊。他说，合作社人多力量大，大家一块想办法管理牲畜，牲畜的死亡率减少了。每年的劳动日分得奶、肉和现金，家里的生活很富裕。
    夏那布还告诉我们，他们的合作社正在准备定居工作。他说，蒙古革命胜利后，变化真大，牧民的生活一天一个样子，牧民定居后，生产和生活还将出现新的景象。
    夏那布的话，使我想起了在去冬冰雪封冻的日子，我们访问过的塔木斯克农场，想起了这个农场的打草老工人布勒格德。
    布勒格德老人，是经历过两个不同时代的人，对新旧社会的不同生活，体会很深。蒙古人民革命胜利前，他是一个十八、九岁的青年，过着被压迫的贫苦牧民的生活。他告诉我们，那时在他经常放牧的那一片草原上，几个又破又黑的蒙古包里住着的牧民，没有牲畜，他们都放牧封建主的牛、羊。在天寒地冻的晚上，蒙古包内一团漆黑，牧民只能裹着破羊皮熬过漫长的冬夜。那时的生活是：“一阵一阵饱，过年饱一阵；一顿一顿饱，杀牛饱一顿”。意思是说，过去经常不得温饱，只是到了过年、杀牛的时候，才能吃一顿饱饭。
    布勒格德现在是农场的优秀打草能手，每月工资二百多图格里克。他儿子是牧马工人。父子二人各住一个大蒙古包。他们现在的生活同布勒格德年青时候经历的苦难，真是天地般悬殊。现在，他们的蒙古包里的铁床、缝纫机、毯子等是老一辈人做梦也想不到的。还有，蒙古包里现在在晚间有电灯照得通明，而几十年前一到夜晚则是漆黑一团，布勒格德说，这不是天翻地复的变化又是什么呢？
    蒙古包和牧民们的变化确是很大。牧民们现在过着幸福的生活，努力建设着他们的国家。布勒格德老人的话，正表达了千千万万牧民们的心情。他说：“生活上是无忧无虑的了，现在的重要问题是怎样把生产搞得更好，使牛、羊增加得更多更快。”（附图片）
