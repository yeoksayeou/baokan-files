Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 24th: The Jakarta "People's Daily" published on the 23rd a statement by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, the full text of which is as follows:

The meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, after listening to and discussing the report of the delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia, led by Comrade Yudo, which attended the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia as an observer, reached the following conclusion:

Before the departure of the observer delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia to Yugoslavia, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, held in Jakarta from March 31st to April 3rd this year, had already discussed the reports of the delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia, which participated in the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, on the "Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Twelve Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Declaration" of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties, and adopted resolutions on fully agreeing with these two documents. In the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Indonesia, revisionism or right-wing opportunism was rejected and condemned.

Two days before the departure of the observer delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia, the leading body of the Communist Party of Indonesia received the "Draft Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia." This draft program clearly contained principles, arguments, and positions that the Communist Party of Indonesia could not endorse in principle, especially regarding the international situation after World War II and the principles, arguments, and positions regarding the international communist movement. Therefore, the Communist Party of Indonesia could only send a delegation as observers to attend the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The observer delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia personally witnessed that those incorrect principles, arguments, and positions were not only upheld but also further developed in the congress, primarily in the speeches of the Yugoslav leaders.

It is thus clear that the Communist Party of Indonesia has no reason to change its position. The Communist Party of Indonesia cannot agree with anything that contradicts the "Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Declaration." It is now even more obvious that the sanctioning of any form of revisionism is very correct and very necessary.

In international politics, the Yugoslav leaders focused their attacks on the Soviet Union, attacking the socialist fortress that has consistently been the target of imperialist attacks. However, the Yugoslav leaders not only practically refrained from criticizing U.S. imperialism but, on the contrary, expressed words of gratitude.

Thus, the Yugoslav leaders confused the enemy and friends, which is misleading and a thorough violation of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and politics.

In terms of the international communist movement, the Yugoslav leaders did not adopt an attitude of strengthening this movement but, on the contrary, adopted an attitude of weakening the unity of the Communist parties. This runs counter to what was stated in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Indonesia: "The unity of the Communist parties is the absolute condition for establishing an anti-imperialist united front."

The attitude adopted by the Yugoslav leaders also violates the "Peace Declaration" of the sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties of the world, which they themselves endorsed. This declaration points out that the main root of the danger of world war is imperialism, primarily U.S. imperialism. However, the Yugoslav leaders believe that it is not U.S. imperialism but the socialist Soviet Union that constitutes the main root of the danger of war.

This contradicts all the facts that have existed and the facts that currently exist, namely that U.S. imperialism is carrying out subversive activities and aggression in Indonesia, Lebanon, Burma, and other places, while the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have always defended those countries that defend their own sovereignty, thereby safeguarding world peace. All of this strengthens what was pointed out in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Indonesia: revisionism is "a manifestation of bourgeois ideology" and "weakens the revolutionary forces of the working class," and therefore must be opposed in principle.

The attitude of the Communist Party of Indonesia in disagreeing with the policies and positions of the Yugoslav Communists does not affect the support of the Communist Party of Indonesia for the peaceful and friendly policies pursued by the Indonesian government and other countries, including Yugoslavia. The relationship between Communist parties, which can only be built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, is not the same as the relationship between countries.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia is pleased to see that Communist parties around the world are consistent and united in their positions on the issue of dealing with modern revisionism or neo-revisionism. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia once again points out that at a time when the imperialists' conspiracies and brutal interference are rampant, the unity of the international working class under the leadership of the Communist parties of all countries, which Marx, Engels, Lenin, and other great teachers of the working class longed for and fought for, is absolutely necessary and must be tempered daily.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局发表声明
    南共领导人彻头彻尾违背马列主义
    南共采取削弱工人阶级力量的立场
    各国共产党必须团结一致予以反对
    新华社雅加达24日电　雅加达“人民日报”23日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局的声明，全文如下：
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局会议在听取了和讨论了以观察员身份出席南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的、由约多同志率领的印度尼西亚共产党代表团的报告之后，作出如下结论：
    在印度尼西亚共产党观察员代表团动身去南斯拉夫之前，从今年3月31日到4月3日在雅加达举行的印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第六次全体会议，已经讨论了参加伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念典礼的印度尼西亚共产党代表团所作的关于“十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”和关于六十四个共产党和工人党的“和平宣言”的报告，并且通过了关于完全同意这两项文件的决议。在印度尼西亚共产党六中全会的决议中，修正主义或右倾机会主义受到了拒绝和谴责。
    在印度尼西亚共产党观察员代表团动身前两天，印度尼西亚共产党的领导机构才接到“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案”。在这个纲领草案中显然载列了在原则上不能为印度尼西亚共产党所赞同的原则、论点和立场，特别是关于第二次世界大战以后的国际形势和关于国际共产主义运动的原则、论点和立场，因此印度尼西亚共产党只有派遣作为观察员的代表团去出席南共第七次代表大会。
    印度尼西亚共产党观察员代表团亲自看到了那些不正确的原则、论点和立场不仅被坚持下来，而且在代表大会中首先在南共领导人的发言中得了进一步的发展。
    由此可见，印度尼西亚共产党完全没有理由改变它的立场。印度尼西亚共产党不可能同意同“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”以及“和平宣言”相违背的事物。而目前更加明显，对任何形式的修正主义的制裁是非常正确和非常必要的。
    在国际政治上，南共领导人集中攻击苏联，攻击一贯成为帝国主义者攻击的对象的社会主义堡垒，但是南共领导人对美帝国主义不仅实际上不加以抨击，而且相反地吐露了感恩的词句。
    这样，南共领导人混淆了敌人和朋友，这是混淆视听的，是彻头彻尾地违背马克思列宁主义的哲学和政治的。
    在国际共产主义运动方面，南共领导人不是采取加强这个运动的态度，而是相反地采取削弱共产党的团结的态度。这和印度尼西亚共产党六中全会决议中所说的“共产党的团结是建立反帝统一战线的绝对条件”是背道而驰的。
    南共领导人所采取的态度还违背他们自己也赞成的全世界六十四个共产党和工人党的“和平宣言”。这项宣言指出，世界战争危险的主要根源是帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义。南共领导人却认为不是美帝国主义而是社会主义苏联构成战争危险的主要根源。
    这是同一切存在过的事实相违背的，也是同目前存在着的事实相违背的，那就是美帝国主义在印度尼西亚、黎巴嫩、缅甸和其他地方进行颠覆活动和侵略，而苏联和其他社会主义国家始终维护那些捍卫自己的主权的国家，从而维护着世界和平。所有这一切加强了印度尼西亚共产党六中全会的决议中所指出的：修正主义是“资产阶级意识形态的表现”，是“削弱工人阶级的革命力量”的，因此必须从原则上加以反对。
    印度尼西亚共产党不同意南共政策和立场的态度，完全不影响印度尼西亚共产党对印度尼西亚政府和其他国家包括南斯拉夫在内所执行的和平和友好政策的支持。只有在马克思列宁主义基础上才可能建立的共产党之间的关系，同国与国之间的关系不是一回事。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局满意地看到，在对付现代修正主义或新修正主义的问题上，全世界共产党立场一致并且团结一致。印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局再一次指出，目前正是帝国主义者的阴谋诡计和粗暴的干涉十分猖獗的时候，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和工人阶级的其他伟大导师所渴望的并且为之奋斗的在各国共产党领导下的国际工人阶级的团结，是绝对必要的和必须每日加以锤炼的。
