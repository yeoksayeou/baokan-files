The goal of developing agricultural production in East China is inspiring
	Two Thousand Jin of Grain Per Person Per Year Within Three to Five Years
	The Current Task is to Implement the Eight Measures to Strive for a Greater Autumn Harvest
	Summer harvest unprecedentedly abundant in four provinces and one city:
	Wheat Increase of 57 Percent
	Rapeseed Increase of 76 Percent
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 27th The inspiring goal put forward at the first agricultural cooperation conference in East China is to increase grain production to an average of two thousand jin per person in three to five years.

	This meeting was presided over by Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting lasted for seven days, and was attended by the secretaries in charge of agriculture and the heads of agriculture, water conservancy and other relevant departments from the four provinces and one city of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shanghai. Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, also attended the meeting.
	According to the meeting's report, although this year's summer harvest crops encountered an unprecedented drought during the autumn planting season last year, followed by continuous severe disasters such as freezing, wind, hail, insects, and diseases. However, thanks to the strengthening of post-management of crops in various places and overcoming various disasters, an unprecedentedly abundant harvest was still achieved. This year's wheat in the four provinces and one city increased by 7.35 billion jin compared to last year, an increase of 57%. Rapeseed also increased by 3.17 million dan compared to last year, an increase of 76.2%.
	The meeting believed that high-yield and abundant harvests have appeared in the three summer crops (barley, wheat, naked barley), rapeseed, broad beans, and peas, and the potential for increased production is great. Therefore, increasing the proportion of summer harvest crops is a strategic task for future agricultural production increases. According to rough estimates, there are still more than 80 million mu of winter fallow land in East China that can be used to develop summer harvest crops. The provinces and cities attending the meeting are prepared to expand the planting area of summer harvest grain crops and rapeseed by more than 15 million mu next year, and further increase the yield per unit area. The meeting studied the grain production targets for the next two years, and all provinces and cities are full of confidence in increasing grain production to an average of 1,000 to 1,500 jin per person in the next two years, and believe that it is entirely possible to increase grain production to an average of 2,000 jin per person in the next three to five years.
	The meeting emphasized that in order to complete the above-mentioned great task of increasing grain production in the shortest possible time, it is necessary to continue to vigorously develop water conservancy, accumulate more fertilizer, improve soil, select improved varieties, implement close planting, strengthen field management, eliminate pests and diseases, and vigorously carry out mass tool reform movements.
	In terms of water conservancy, the meeting requested that in areas south of the Yangtze River that have been basically water-conserved this winter and next spring, continue to do a good job in finishing touches to further consolidate and improve. In the plains north of the Yangtze River, the main task is to realize a river network, so that rivers are connected to rivers, ditches are connected to ditches, and rivers, ditches and ponds are connected together. The meeting also studied the water conservancy work in hilly and mountainous areas.
	In terms of fertilizer, the meeting believed that it should still rely mainly on farm manure, and mobilize the masses to accumulate fertilizer every day. Call for sea fertilizer to land and mountain fertilizer to go down the mountains. Increase the amount of fertilizer accumulated next year by more than double, and the quality should also be improved, reaching an average of 2,200 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. Anhui Province's diverse fertilizer accumulation methods of "burning, smoking, digging, exchanging, sweeping, shoveling, composting, piling, picking up, and dredging" can be promoted. At the same time, by next year, all communes should run local chemical fertilizer plants, and two-thirds of the counties and cities should set up "foreign" chemical fertilizer plants and bacterial fertilizer plants.
	Deep plowing of land and soil improvement are important measures to increase production. Before the autumn of next year, all arable land should be deep plowed (or added with soil) once, to a depth of one to two chi, and soil should be improved by means of soil replacement, soil mixing, and fertilization.
	Next year, the improved varieties of crops should be realized, and close planting should be universally promoted.
	Basically eliminate various pests and diseases that endanger crops in the second five-year plan, and make significant achievements in the next two years.
	The meeting believed that the method of "tasks to the team, specialization to the group, measures to the field, responsibility to the person, and acceptance by inserting signs" created by Jiangsu, Anhui and other places is an important experience in field management of crops, and it was decided to vigorously promote it. All provinces and cities also requested that the management work of crops "from cultivation to sowing, from sowing to green, from green to yellow, from yellow to the field, and from the field to the barn" should be done carefully and meticulously.
	The meeting believed that it is necessary to immediately change the current phenomenon in some places where only creation but no promotion, and only promotion but no use, in tool reform. It is required to complete the task of popularizing improved farm tools this year, and all improved farm tools should be used next year. It is required that the efficiency of all improved tools should be at least twice that of the original tools.
	This meeting also exchanged situations and experiences on the development of cotton, oil crops, sericulture, forestry, aquaculture, animal husbandry, and the development of mass agricultural scientific research, and studied development targets.
	The meeting believed that the total output of autumn grain crops this year will account for 84.6% of the total grain output of the year, so taking various effective measures to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year is the key to a comprehensive increase in production this year. After research, it was unanimously believed that in order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, the following eight tasks must be grasped: First, resist drought and rush to plant, complete summer planting and autumn planting; Second, strengthen field management, irrigate, topdress, cultivate, weed, and cultivate soil in a timely manner, and eliminate the three types of seedlings at any time; Third, resolutely overcome water, drought, and typhoon disasters, and townships and communes should self-manufacture pesticides and agricultural machinery to eliminate pests and diseases; Fourth, mobilize the masses to accumulate and manufacture quick-acting fertilizers; Fifth, vigorously engage in tool reform; Sixth, implement division of labor and specialization, and improve labor organization; Seventh, organize cattle farms to ensure timely cultivation; Eighth, organize large-scale cooperation between townships and communes, and cities support rural areas.
	The meeting believed that it is necessary to continue to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and combine the further in-depth publicity of the general line to hand over the struggle goals of gradually increasing grain production to an average of 1,500 jin and 2,000 jin per person to the masses for discussion, in order to further arouse greater enthusiasm and promote the leap forward in production. The meeting also believed that the struggle against various capitalist ideas in rural areas cannot be relaxed, and socialist ideological education should be carried out frequently to maintain the sustained enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants.
	Finally, Comrade Tan Zhenlin made a summary speech at the meeting.

    华东地区发展农业生产的目标振奋人心
    三五年内每人每年两千斤粮
    当前的任务是实现八项措施争取秋季更大丰收
    四省一市夏季空前大丰收：
    小麦增长百分之五十七
    油菜增长百分之七十六
    新华社合肥27日电　在三年到五年内，要把粮食产量提高到每人平均二千斤。这是在华东区第一次农业协作会议上提出的令人振奋的奋斗目标。
    这次会议是由中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志主持召开的。会议共开了七天，参加会议的有中共安徽、江苏、浙江、福建、上海四省一市掌管农业的书记和农业、水利等有关部门的负责人。农业部副部长刘瑞龙也参加了会议。
    根据会议汇报，今年夏收作物虽然在去年秋种时遇到了几十年来未有的大旱，接着又连续遭受到严重的冻、风、雹、虫、病等灾害。但由于各地加强了对作物的后期管理，战胜了各种灾害，仍然获得空前未有的大丰收。四省一市今年小麦比去年增产七十三点五亿斤，即增长57％。油菜也比去年增产了三百一十七万担，即增长76.2％。
    会议认为今年三麦（大麦、小麦、元麦）、油菜、蚕豆和豌豆等都出现了高额丰产，增产的潜力都很大，所以提高夏收作物比重，是今后农业增产的一项具有战略性的任务。据粗略估计，华东地区尚有冬闲田八千多万亩，可以用来发展夏收作物。到会各省市准备把明年的夏收粮食作物和油菜的种植面积扩大一千五百多万亩，并进一步提高单位面积产量。会议研究了今明两年的粮食生产指标，各省市对今明两年把粮食产量提高到平均每人一千斤到一千五百斤都满怀信心，并且认为在今后三年到五年内使粮食增产到每人平均有二千斤是完全可能的。
    会议强调指出，要在最短期间内完成上述粮食增产的伟大任务，必须继续大兴水利、多多积肥、改良土壤、选用良种、实行密植、加强田间管理、消灭病虫害和大力开展群众性的工具改革运动。
    在水利方面，会议要求今冬明春在长江以南已基本水利化的地区，继续做好扫尾工程，进一步巩固提高。在长江以北平原地区，主要任务是实现河网化，做到河河相通，沟沟相连，河沟塘连成一起。会议对丘陵和山区的水利工作也进行了研究。
    肥料方面，会议认为仍应依靠农家肥料为主，发动群众天天积肥。叫海肥登陆，让山肥下山。把明年的积肥量再增加一倍以上，质量也要提高，达到每亩平均施肥二千二百担。安徽省采取“烧、熏、挖、换、扫、铲、沤、堆、拾、捞”的多种多样的积肥办法，可以推广。同时，各地到明年要做到社社大办土化肥厂，要有二分之一的县市办起“洋”化肥厂和细菌肥料厂。
    深翻土地和改良土壤是增产的重要措施之一。明年秋前，要把全部耕地都深翻（或加土）一次，深度达到一尺到二尺，并采取换土、掺土、施肥等办法，改良土壤。
    明年要实现农作物的良种化，并且要求普遍推行密植。
    在第二个五年计划内基本上消灭危害农作物的各种病虫害，并在今明两年内做出显著成绩来。
    会议认为，江苏、安徽等地创造的“任务到队，专业到组，措施到田，责任到人，插标验收”办法，是农作物田间管理的重要经验，决定大力推广。各省市还要求把农作物“从耕到播、从播到青、从青到黄、从黄到场、从场到仓”等一系列的管理工作，都要认真细致地做好。
    会议认为，必须立即改变目前有些地方在工具改革中只创造不推广，只推广不使用的现象。要求今年内完成推广改良农具的任务，明年全部使用改良农具。要求所有改良工具的工效至少比原有工具提高两倍。
    这次会议还对发展棉花、油料、蚕桑、林业、水产、畜牧和开展群众性农业科学研究工作等问题，交换了情况和经验，并研究了发展指标。
    会议认为，今年大秋粮食作物的总产量将占全年粮食产量的84.6％，所以采取各项有效措施，争取今年大秋作物丰收，是今年全面增产的关键。经过研究，一致认为争取大秋丰收必须抓紧下列八项工作：一、抗旱抢种，完成夏种、秋种；二、加强田间管理，适时灌溉、追肥、中耕、锄草、培土等，随时消灭三类苗；三、坚决战胜水、旱和台风灾害，乡乡社社自制农药、农械，消灭病虫；四、发动群众积造速效性肥料；五、大搞工具改革；六、实行分工分业，改善劳动组织；七、组织耕牛站，保证及时耕种；八、组织乡乡社社大协作，城市支援农村。
    会议认为必须继续依靠群众，发动群众，结合总路线的进一步深入宣传，把粮食生产逐步提高到每人平均有一千五百斤和二千斤的奋斗目标交给群众讨论，以便进一步鼓起更大的干劲，推动生产飞跃前进。会议并认为不能放松对农村各种资本主义思想的斗争，要经常进行社会主义思想教育，使广大农民的干劲持续不懈。
    会议最后由谭震林同志作了总结发言。
