　　Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: Lebanese National Front leader and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam said during a meeting with a United Press International reporter on the 18th, "We will use all means at our disposal to resist armed intervention in Lebanon by the US and Britain or the entry of any international police force into Lebanon." Salam said that the Lebanese opposition believes that the United Nations' dispatch of observers is "inappropriate and unwise."

　　Salam accused the United States and Britain of actively preparing to send troops to Lebanon for armed intervention in order to support "President Chamoun's corrupt regime." He said: We are outraged by any international action that interferes in our internal affairs. We will consider them (referring to the US and UK interventionists) as aggressors occupying a sovereign country, and we will resist with all our might. We will resist any international police force attempting to seize police power.

　　Comprehensive report by this newspaper, via Xinhua News Agency: The United States and Britain are preparing for armed intervention in Lebanon with swords drawn. The situation in Lebanon has become very critical.

　　The US and UK continue to intend to use the United Nations to achieve their aim of aggression against Lebanon. The US State Department summoned the ambassadors of many countries, including Arab nations, on the 18th to discuss the situation in Lebanon. According to Western news agencies, the United States believes that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's trip to Beirut and the recommendations he will make upon his return are "very important." The report said that if Hammarskjöld recommends "more effective action" than sending an observer group, he will receive "full support" from the United States.

　　UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld arrived in Beirut on the morning of the 19th. Hammarskjöld met with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd in London on the 18th. It is reported that Lloyd stated that Britain would give "full support" to the UN's activities in Lebanon.

　　At the same time, the British government continues to deploy troops to Cyprus. The British Ministry of Defense announced on the 18th that a Guards brigade would be airlifted to Cyprus from the 20th, while a paratrooper brigade of three to four thousand men has already arrived in Cyprus, and an artillery regiment is also arriving in a steady stream.

　　Reuters said that the number of British troops on the island currently "exceeds 30,000." Military experts in London believe that this build-up of forces is "related to the events in Lebanon."

　　It is reported that the scale of the US armed forces gathered near the island of Cyprus is even larger. A large number of reinforcing bomber squadrons have arrived at the US base in Izmir.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 19th: According to the Voice of Free Lebanon radio broadcast, the Lebanese People's Army launched attacks on some strongholds controlled by government forces in the Baalbek region in central Lebanon and the Marjayoun region in southern Lebanon on the 18th.

　　The radio said that in the Baalbek region, the People's Army surrounded some strongholds controlled by government forces and destroyed a government forces' aircraft, several armored vehicles, and tanks.

    黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖表示
    准备全力抵抗美英武装侵略
    起义部队继续向政府军据点发动进攻
    据新华社19日讯　黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖、前总理萨拉姆在18日接见合众国际社记者的时候说，“我们将使用我们的一切手段来抵抗英美对黎巴嫩的武装干涉或任何国际警察部队的进入黎巴嫩”。萨拉姆说，黎巴嫩反对派认为，联合国派遣观察员的行动是“不恰当和不明智的”。
    萨拉姆指责美国和英国正在积极准备派军队对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉，以支持“夏蒙总统的腐朽的政权。”他说：我们对于干涉我们的内政的任何国际行动都感到愤怒。我们将认为它们（指美英干涉者）是占领一个自主国家的侵略者，我们要尽我们的一切力量进行抵抗。我们要抵抗试图取得警察权力的任何国际警察部队。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美英两国正在剑拔弩张地准备对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。黎巴嫩的局势已经十分危急。
    美英继续打算利用联合国来达到侵略黎巴嫩的目的。美国国务院18日召见了包括阿拉伯国家在内的许多国家的使节，讨论黎巴嫩局势。据西方通讯社消息说，美国认为，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德这次贝鲁特之行以及他回来后将要提出的建议“很重要”。消息说，如果哈马舍尔德建议采取比派遣一个观察团“更为有效的行动”，他将会得到美国的“全力支持”。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德于19日清晨到达贝鲁特。哈马舍尔德18日在伦敦曾经同英国外交大臣劳埃德举行会谈。据悉，劳埃德表示，对于联合国在黎巴嫩的活动，英国将“完全支持”。
    同时，英国政府继续调兵遣将到塞浦路斯。英国国防部18日宣布，一个近卫旅将从20日空运到塞浦路斯，而拥有三、四千人的一个伞兵旅已全部抵达塞浦路斯、一个炮兵团也源源到达。
    路透社说，目前，这个岛上的英国军队人数“超过三万人”。伦敦的军事专家认为，这种兵力集结“同黎巴嫩的事件有关”。
    据报道，美国武装部队在塞浦路斯岛附近集结的规模更是庞大。大批增援的轰炸机队又抵达伊兹密尔的美国基地。
    新华社大马士革19日电　据自由黎巴嫩之声电台广播，黎巴嫩人民军18日在黎巴嫩中部的巴尔贝克和南部的迈尔杰乌荣地区向政府部队控制下的一些据点发动了进攻。
    电台说，在巴尔贝克地区，人民军包围了政府部队控制下的一些据点，并且击毁了政府部队的一架飞机、几辆装甲车和坦克。
