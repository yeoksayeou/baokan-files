How Much Firewood is Burned in a Year?

In eleven provinces of China, including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou, there are more than 2,600 ceramic kilns that use firewood as fuel. They consume more than 1.6 million tons of firewood annually, equivalent to 4 million cubic meters, of which 80% is mature pine wood. If these timbers were used for papermaking, they could produce more than 1 million tons of newsprint, exceeding the total national newsprint production in 1957. The value would be more than ten times the total national ceramic output value in 1957. (Huang Gang)

    一年要烧多少柴
    我国江西、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、福建、江苏、浙江、云南、四川、贵州等十一省，共有以柴为燃料的陶瓷窑二千六百多座，每年耗柴一百六十万吨以上，折合四百万立方公尺，其中80％是成材的松树。这些木材如用于造纸，可以生产新闻纸一百多万吨，超过1957年全国新闻纸的总产量，价值相当于1957年全国陶瓷总产值的十倍以上。　　　　（黄岗）
