    Xinhua News Agency News: China's first open-air boiler without a boiler room has recently been successfully designed. This is the result of the innovative spirit of the designers at Harbin Boiler Factory.

    This open-air medium-pressure boiler, with a steam evaporation capacity of 120 tons per hour, will begin trial production in August this year. After the trial production is complete, it will be matched with a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine manufactured by the Shanghai Turbine Factory and is planned to be installed in the Xiaguan Power Plant in Nanjing.

    Using open-air boilers to build thermal power plants is a major measure to save funds. According to existing partial data, adopting open-air boilers can reduce the construction investment of the main plant building by about 50%. This type of boiler is suitable for warmer climates and can be widely used in areas south of the Yellow River in China.

    The technology for designing open-air boilers is very complex. Because it does not have a boiler room for protection, the design must solve problems such as fear of freezing, fear of being blown down by strong winds, fear of rain, and fear of sand, soil, and metal corrosion.

    露天式锅炉设计出来了
    据新华社讯　我国第一台不用锅炉房的露天式锅炉在最近设计成功，这是哈尔滨锅炉厂的设计师们发挥独创精神的结果。
    这台每小时蒸气蒸发量一百二十吨的露天式中压锅炉，将在今年8月份开始试制；试制好以后，将同上海汽轮机厂制造的二万五千瓩的汽轮机搭配成套，准备安装在南京下关发电厂里。
    采用露天式锅炉建设火力发电站是节省资金的一项重大措施。据已有的部分资料考查，采用露天式锅炉，可以降低主厂房建设投资50％左右。这种锅炉适用于气候较暖的地区，在中国的黄河以南各地可以大量采用。
    设计露天式锅炉的技术很复杂。因为它没有锅炉房作掩护，在设计上要解决怕冻、怕大风吹倒、怕雨打、怕砂土和金属的腐蚀等难题。
