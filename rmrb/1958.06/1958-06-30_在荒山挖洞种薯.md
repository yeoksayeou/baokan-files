　　Digging Holes to Plant Sweet Potatoes on Barren Hills
　　Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, are making full use of barren hills and vacant land to dig holes and plant sweet potatoes. The Jinxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this method not only makes full use of every inch of land, greatly increases sweet potato production, but also allows for planting radishes or wheat after harvesting the sweet potatoes. It is a good method that requires less labor, has low costs, and yields high returns. The county plans to dig five million holes this year, with each hole expected to yield ten to fifteen catties, and the harvest is estimated to be equivalent to more than fifteen million catties of staple food. By the 15th, the county had already dug more than 1.6 million sweet potato holes.
　　Last year, some agricultural cooperatives in Chixi, Zhongjie and other townships in the county dug holes to plant sweet potatoes on barren hills and wild land, which generally resulted in a bumper harvest. The method of digging holes to plant sweet potatoes is very simple. Whether it is barren hills, camellia hills, wooded hills, grave hills, or in front of villages and behind houses, as long as there is sunlight, holes can be dug to plant sweet potatoes. Their experience is: about 200 holes can be dug per mu of hillside area, each hole being two chi square and one chi five cun deep, with the distance between holes being about two chi. After the holes are dug, the surrounding grass is removed and placed in the holes, along with some pig and cow manure or sludge, garbage, etc., to rot the grass. Then, five or six sweet potato seedlings are planted on top of each hole. This method utilizes local materials to make fertilizer, which not only saves labor but also improves fertilizer efficiency and improves the soil, resulting in particularly fast sweet potato growth.

    在荒山挖洞种薯
    江西省进贤县各地农业社充分利用荒山空地挖洞栽红薯。中共进贤县委认为，这样既可做到寸土寸用，大量增产红薯，收了红薯后，还可以种上萝卜或麦子，是一个花工少，成本低，收益大的好办法。全县今年计划挖洞五百万个，每洞产量按十斤到十五斤计算，收获量折合主粮预计可达一千五百多万斤。到15日止，全县已挖红薯洞一百六十多万个。
    去年，这个县的池溪、中结等乡有些农业社社员，利用荒山野地挖洞种薯，曾普遍得到丰收。挖洞种薯的办法很简单，不论荒山野地、油茶山、树林山、坆山、村前屋后，只要有日照的地方，都可以挖洞种薯。他们的经验是：每亩山地面积可打洞二百个左右，每洞二尺见方，一尺五寸深，洞与洞的距离相隔二尺左右。洞挖好后，就把周围的青草铲光放到洞里，加上一些猪、牛粪或污泥、垃圾等，把青草沤烂，然后在每个洞上面栽种五、六蔸薯苗。这样，就地取材沤肥，既节省人工，又可提高肥效、改良土壤，红薯生长特别快。
