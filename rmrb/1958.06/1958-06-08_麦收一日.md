　　One Day of Wheat Harvest
　　Written collectively by our reporters
    After a winter of hard work and a spring of great effort, the broad masses of the people of Henan Province are now, with a spirit of perseverance and tenacity, launching a campaign throughout the province to rush the harvest, rush the transport, and rush the threshing of wheat. At present, 30 million laborers across the province are joining the battle every day, advancing at a rate of nearly 10 million mu harvested per day. The following are the heroic spirits of the people of Henan Province during the wheat harvest, as seen by reporters on June 3 in various different areas of the province:

    Frontline Headquarters
    June 3 was the first day of the full-scale wheat harvest in Meng County. At one o'clock in the morning, the county committee was quiet, all the cadres having been assigned to various townships and cooperatives throughout the county to lead and assist the masses in the wheat harvest.
    In the Dongjie Agricultural Cooperative of Chengguan Township, the reporter met Yuan Hongzhen, Deputy Secretary of the CPC County Committee. He told the reporter that each of the twenty-three members of the County Committee was responsible for commanding a township during the wheat harvest. He was responsible for directing the summer harvest work in Chengguan Township. He also said, "In this tense time, we command wherever we go; our headquarters are mobile!"
    In the Dongjie Agricultural Cooperative, Yuan Hongzhen held a meeting of cooperative cadres in just half an hour. Like an experienced commander, he first analyzed the situation, saying: According to his inspection in the wheat fields during the day, some loose-grained varieties, such as Bima No. 1, had already lost more than thirty grains per square meter, which would result in a loss of twelve jin per mu. Originally, some people felt that it was a bit early to start harvesting, but after his explanation, everyone understood and immediately organized and arranged the labor force, quickly taking action.
    The reporter and Yuan Hongzhen inspected several cooperatives by moonlight and then joined the people in cutting wheat in the fields until dawn. After the cooperative members went home for breakfast, Yuan Hongzhen ran off to inspect other agricultural cooperatives.

    "New Villages" in the Wheat Sea
    In Nanling Village, Xihua County, the reporter visited the temporary families established in the wheat fields to overcome the special difficulties of having few people, much land, and insufficient transportation during the wheat harvest. In the boundless golden sea of wheat, next to the newly rolled threshing grounds, were neatly arranged rows of simple straw sheds. The agricultural cooperative's office, the temporary combat headquarters of each production team, the busy-season canteen, the livestock breeding room, and the infant feeding room specially set up for women with children were all concentrated here. From a distance, in that golden sea of wheat, they looked like small islands. Many people told the reporter that since the full-scale harvest began in Nanling Cooperative on the evening of the 2nd, all seven hundred able-bodied laborers in the cooperative had spent a full day and night here. People ate, worked, and rested here, and the boundaries between family and wheat field, day and night, had all disappeared.
    In this "temporary family on the battlefield," the reporter met a couple. The man's name was Song Zhenyuan. On this day, he was leading several skilled wheat cutters, busily cutting wheat in the fields. The woman's name was Li Aihua, and she was working with a group of women to transport the cut wheat to the threshing ground. Since the wheat harvest began, the couple had moved to the threshing ground together. The older of their two children was sent to the busy-season nursery, and the younger was sent to the infant feeding room. They ate in the busy-season canteen. On the evening of the 2nd, the two of them issued a challenge and worked all night. Song Zhenyuan and six skilled wheat cutters used scythes to cut seventy mu of wheat in one night, and Li Aihua and the women transported all seventy mu of wheat to the threshing ground and stacked it up. People praised them as model couples and model families on the wheat harvest site.

    "Wheat Harvest Expedition Team" in the Yellow River Flood Area
    In Xihua County, in the "Yellow River Flood Area," more than 600 members of the "Wheat Harvest Expedition Team" dispatched by the provincial government also plunged into the battle in earnest on this day. The sixty-odd cadres from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, who were assigned to the Lingtougang Agricultural Cooperative, had been working continuously from the second half of last night until noon, without rest for more than ten hours. In the tense crowd of wheat cutters, a young female cadre left many of her male companions behind. Even some members of the agricultural cooperative praised her for being as good as a full laborer. She was He Qingyun, a technician from the Water Conservancy Department of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission.
    The leader of this expedition team told the reporter the following story: A few days ago, when it was raining, people braved the rain to rush the harvest, and their whole bodies were soaked. At that time, the leaders did not dare to approve the demand for round-the-clock harvesting that everyone had put forward. One day, a man named Yang Shibin, taking advantage of the fact that everyone was asleep at night, secretly sneaked into the wheat field with a sickle. Unexpectedly, dozens of people with the same idea as Yang Shibin also followed one after another. That night, they cut eighty mu of wheat.

    The Final Fierce Battle
    In Laowangpo, Xiping County, the wheat harvest had entered a tense stage on this day. In the early morning, the Xiping County Laowangpo Wheat Harvest and Summer Planting Headquarters issued an order to launch a "general attack." They demanded that the remaining 40% of the wheat fields be completely harvested before the 4th. On the boundless plain, the red flags of the harvesting army fluttered. The office cadres, students, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers who had come to support the wheat harvest here, although they had been fighting fiercely for three days and nights, went to the fields with the local farmers again before dawn today. Many people wrapped towels around their hands, which were covered in blisters, gritted their teeth, and threw themselves into the battle. Carts, wagons, and wheelbarrows loaded with golden wheat ears were constantly moving across the open fields.
    Laowangpo is a flood storage area on the Hong River. It covers an area of more than one hundred li and has a population of only 70,000. In the past, because there was a lot of land and little labor, the wheat harvest was often delayed by more than a month every year. When the rainy season came, people had to take boats to the water to salvage the wheat. This year, in order to support the wheat harvest here, the leading organs of the province, the special zone, and the county successively sent more than 4,000 cadres, students, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, as well as nineteen automobiles, fifty horse-drawn carts, and more than two hundred wheelbarrows to help with the harvest. In the three days starting on the 31st of last month, nearly 60% of the more than 140,000 mu of wheat had been harvested.
    At 11 p.m., when the reporter was sending the draft by telephone, the lights of cars were still flashing outside the window from time to time. The rumbling of cars and the sound of horns, the calls of donkeys and horses, singing, and laughter were interwoven into one. This originally very desolate wilderness had become a "noisy city" that never sleeps.

    "Newbies" in the Wheat Harvest
    The reporter came to the wheat field north of the Gongtong Third Agricultural Cooperative in Changge County and met Comrade Wang Guoming, a cadre transferred from the Supreme People's Court, in the wheat harvesting team. Although she was not very skilled at cutting wheat, she was very enthusiastic about it. She went to the field at more than four o'clock this morning, with a blue towel tied around her head and her trousers rolled up high. Although her face was covered with sweat, she could not suppress the joy in her heart. In the four months or so that she had been transferred here, she had watered, top-dressed, and weeded the wheat fields day and night. Now, she had finally achieved a bumper harvest of 400 jin of wheat per mu, which was estimated. When she thought of this, she cut even harder. She happily told the reporter: On the first day of rushing the harvest, I was still a "newbie" and cut my finger with the sickle, but now I have trained myself to be able to cut one mu of land a day!

    Laughter on the Threshing Ground
    "When the wheat reaches the threshing ground, young and old are overjoyed; the wheat stalks are as tall as a person, and the wheat ears are half a foot long." This is the song that the reporter heard on the threshing ground of the Guanhutun Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou.
    On the morning of June 3, when the reporter arrived at the threshing ground, there was only one stack of threshed wheat stalks, and the threshing ground was still very wide. But in just a few hours, the wide threshing ground became smaller, and more than a dozen high stacks of wheat were piled up on the ground. The young men cracked their whips, transporting bundles of wheat to the ground in carts one after another. More than thirty people were busy chopping, stacking, and threshing in the field, some shouting, "Hurry up! Leap forward," and others singing. Cooperative director Liu Shouchong told the reporter that because this year's wheat grew too well, each of the five production teams in the cooperative had a threshing ground, and each ground was three or four mu larger than last year, but it was still not enough. This ground should stack wheat from more than 350 mu of land, but now it has only transported wheat from more than 50 mu, and the ground is already full. There were many people counting the wheat ears on the ground, some wheat ears had 131 grains, and most had more than 50 grains. Some experienced cooperative members estimated the size of the wheat stacks, and the largest wheat stack, which stacked wheat from 20 mu of land, could yield at least 16,000 jin. More than a month ago, Premier Zhou had visited this cooperative. In order to thank Premier Zhou for his concern, the cooperative members cut a bundle of the best wheat today, preparing to send it to Beijing to report the good news to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou.
    For a Greater Harvest Next Year
    Yanshi County Yuetan Agricultural Cooperative launched a cooperative-wide seed selection upsurge today. On the beach between the Yi River and the Luo River, in the twelve-li square wheat sea, there were joyful working crowds everywhere, one side was the harvesting team wielding sickles like shuttles, and the other side was the seed selection team holding scissors and willow baskets, like reconnaissance soldiers. In the past few years, this cooperative has paid attention to seed selection every year, and the increase in production has been significant. On the evening of the 2nd, while arranging for the full-scale harvest, the cooperative also studied and arranged the seed selection work. Today, the entire cooperative dispatched more than 130 seed selection team members. In a field, the reporter saw a girl concentrating like an embroiderer, using her skillful hands to cut off the large wheat ears, and soon filled a basket. Others told me that she was Liu Tieniu, a seed selection expert with two years of seed selection experience.
    Liu Yingxiang, the secretary of the CPC branch of this cooperative, is a seed expert who has been studying excellent varieties of wheat for four or five years. Last year, he carefully selected seven varieties, and this year, he selected thirty-seven excellent varieties of various natural hybrids. In the morning, the reporter and he set off to the south bank of the Yi River to inspect the work. Along the way, he selected a handful of wheat ears. Sometimes, when he saw that the girls in the seed selection team had selected bad seeds, he gave them lessons on the spot, teaching them seed selection techniques. On the way back to the cooperative office with Liu Yingxiang, the reporter met Liu Guangju, the director of the cooperative, who waved a bunch of freshly picked wheat ears from afar. It turned out that Liu Guangju had gone to the wheat field early this morning to select seeds. In a short while, based on his experience, he selected twenty-five large ears, the smallest with more than eighty grains, and the largest with more than 110 grains, more than two inches long, and the plump wheat kernels were about to roll out. Liu Yingxiang took it over and said: "These are really good seeds. Keep them and plant them in the experimental field in the autumn." Liu Guangju expertly told the surrounding onlookers: "These ears look like natural hybrids of Bima No. 1 and Xinong 628, or Bima No. 4." He also said: "The natural hybrid varieties selected from the large fields are much better than artificial hybrid varieties and have stronger adaptability."
    On this day, more than a dozen seed selection teams in the cooperative selected more than 1,000 jin of seeds. With the bumper harvest of wheat, they will expand the seed selection activities more widely. The cooperative plans to select 50,000 jin of good wheat varieties this year to ensure that each mu will have 25 jin of excellent seeds in the autumn sowing. (Attached picture)

　　麦收一日
　　本报记者集体采写
    经过苦干一冬，大干一春的河南省广大人民，现在又以坚毅顽强的精神，在全省展开了抢收、抢运、抢打小麦的运动。现在，全省每天都有三千万劳动大军投入战斗，以每日收割近一千万亩的速度向前迈进。下面是记者在6月3日这一天，在全省各个不同地区看到的河南省人民在麦收中的英雄气概：
    火线司令部
    6月3日，是孟县小麦全面收割的第一天。凌晨一时，县委会静悄悄的，所有的干部都被分配到全县各乡、社里领导和帮助群众麦收去了。
    在城关乡东街农业社里，记者遇到了中共县委副书记原洪真，他对记者说，县委会的二十三个县委委员，麦收中每人都包干指挥一个乡。他是负责指挥城关乡的夏收工作。他又说：“在这紧张的时候，走到那里，就指挥到那里，咱们这指挥部是活动的！”
    在东街农业社里，原洪真只用半个钟头就召开了一次社干部会，他像一个有经验的指挥员，首先分析了情况，说：根据他白天在麦田里进行的检查，一些口松的品种如碧蚂一号，每一平方公尺已掉粒三十多个，这样每亩要损失十二斤。本来有的还觉得现在开镰收割有些早，经过他这一讲，大家都想通了，立即组织和安排了劳动力，很快的行动起来了。
    记者和原洪真一起借着月光检查了几个社，便和人们一同在麦田里割起麦来，直到东方发白，社员们都陆续回家吃饭了，原洪真却又跑着到别的农业社里检查去了。
    麦海中的“新村”
    在西华县南凌村里，记者参观了人们为了克服麦收期间这里人少地多运输工具不足的特殊困难，在麦田里建立起来的临时家庭。在一望无边的金黄色的麦海里，新压好的一片片打麦场旁，整齐的搭起了一排排地简易草棚，农业社的办公室和各个生产队的临时作战指挥部，农忙食堂、牲畜饲养室和专门为带孩子的妇女而设立的婴儿哺乳室，全部集中在这里。远远望去，在那金黄色的麦海里，好像是一座座小岛。不少人都告诉记者说：自从2日晚上南凌社全面开始收割起，全社七百多个能劳动的已经在这里度过了整整一昼夜，人们在这里就地吃饭，就地劳动，就地休息，家庭和麦地、白天与黑夜的界限，全都消失了。
    记者在这“战地的临时家庭”里，遇到了一对夫妇。男的叫宋振元，这天他正带领几个割麦能手，紧张地在田间割麦，女的叫李爱华，正在和一群妇女一道把割下来的麦子向场里搬运。这对夫妇自从麦收开始，就双双搬到了打麦场上，两个小孩，大的送到农忙托儿所，小的送进了婴儿哺乳室。他俩在农忙食堂吃饭。在2日晚上，两人提出挑战，整整干了一个通宵。宋振元和六个割麦能手用钐刀一夜割了七十亩麦子，李爱华和妇女们一道把七十亩麦子全部搬到场上垛好。人们都称赞他俩是麦收工地上的模范夫妇，战场上的模范家庭。
    黄泛区的“麦收远征队”
    在“黄泛区”的西华县里，省直机关派来的六百多名“麦收远征队”，这天也紧张地投入了战斗。分配在陵头岗农业社的六十多个黄河水利委员会的干部，从昨天下半夜，一直干到中午，已经有十多个小时没有休息了。在紧张割麦的人群中，有一位年轻的女干部，把她的许多男同伴都撇在了后面。连一些农业社的社员们也都称赞她抵住一个整劳力了。她就是黄河水利委员会水利处的技术员何清云。
    这个远征队的负责人告诉记者这样一个故事：那是在前几天下雨的时候，人们冒雨抢收，浑身上下都被雨水淋透，当时领导上一直都不敢批准大家所提出的日夜收割的要求。有一天，一个名叫杨世滨的，趁着夜晚大家都睡了，一个人拿着镰刀偷偷的溜到麦地里，但谁料想几十个和杨世滨怀着一样思想的人，也都一个跟一个地溜了来，这一夜他们就割了八十亩小麦。
    最后的激战
    在西平县老王坡，这天麦收已进入紧张阶段。清晨，西平县老王坡麦收夏种指挥部，便下达了发动“总攻击”的命令。要求在4日以前，把剩余的40％多的麦田全部收割完。在无边的原野上，收割大军的红旗招展。特地前来支援这里麦收的机关干部、学生和人民解放军官兵，他们虽然已经整整鏖战了三个昼夜，可是今天天还没亮，又和这里的农民一道走到田野里去了。不少人在磨满了血泡的手上，缠上手巾，咬紧牙关，投入了战斗。满载着金黄色麦穗的牛车、马车和人力车在旷野上络绎不绝。
    老王坡是洪河上的一个蓄洪区。方圆足有一百多里，只有七万多人口。过去，由于地多劳动力少，每年麦收常常拖延一个多月。雨季到来时，人们就要坐着船下水捞麦。今年，省、专区和县的领导机关为了支援这里的麦收，先后派来了四千多个干部、学生和人民解放军官兵，还有十九部汽车、五十辆马车和二百多辆架子车前来帮助收麦。自上月31日开始的三天内，十四万多亩小麦就收割完了将近60％。
    深夜十一时，当记者在用电话传稿时，窗外还不时闪耀着汽车的灯光，隆隆的汽车声和喇叭声，驴、马的叫声，歌唱声和欢笑声，交织成一片，这个原来十分荒凉的旷野，变成了一个不夜的“闹市”。
    麦收中的“新手”
    记者来到长葛县共同第三农业社北面的麦田里，在麦收队伍里，遇到了最高人民法院下放的干部王国明同志。她割起麦来虽然很不熟练，但干的却特别红火。她今天早晨四点多钟就下地了，头上扎着蓝毛巾，裤腿卷得高高的。虽然满脸汗水，但总压抑不住内心的高兴。在她下放到这里的四个多月里，她曾不分昼夜地向麦田里浇水、追肥、拔草，如今终于获得了预计亩产小麦四百斤的大丰收，她想到这里，割得就更加起劲。她高兴地向记者说：在抢收的第一天，我还是“新手”，被镰刀割破了手指头，现在我已经锻炼成一天能割一亩地！
    打麦场上的欢笑
    “麦子登上场，老少喜洋洋；麦秸有人高，麦穗半尺长。”这是记者在郑州郊区关虎屯农业社的麦场上听到的歌声。
    6月3日上午，当记者来到麦场上的时候，仅有一垛已经打过的大麦秸，麦场还十分宽阔。但只过几个钟头，宽阔的麦场便变小了，场上堆起十几个高大的麦垛。小伙子们甩着鞭子，一车车的把麦束运到场上，三十多个人在场上川流不息的忙着铡碎、垛麦和打场，有的人喊着：“快呀！跃进”，也有的人在歌唱。社长刘守忠对记者说，因为今年的麦子长的太好，全社五个生产队，每个队都有一个场，个个场都比去年扩大了三、四亩，还是放不开。这个场里应该垛三百五十多亩地的麦子，现在只运进了五十多亩，便把场占满了。在场上有许多人在数麦穗，有的一颗麦穗结一百三十一个粒，一般的都在五十粒以上。一些有经验的社员按照麦垛的大小估算了一下，其中最大的一个垛着二十亩麦子的麦垛，最低能打一万六千斤。一个多月以前，周总理曾经到这个社来参观过，社员们为了感谢周总理的关怀，今天他们割了一捆最好的麦子，准备送到北京，向毛主席和周总理报喜。
    为了明年更大的丰收
    偃师县岳滩农业社今天展开了全社性的选种高潮。在伊河和洛河两河夹峙的滩头上，十二里方圆的麦海里，到处是欢乐的劳动人群，一边是挥镰如梭的收割队，一面是拿着剪刀和柳条筐，像侦察兵一样的选种组。这个社在过去几年里，因为年年注意选种，增产得到显著效果。2日晚上，社里在布置全面开始收割的同时，又研究布置了选种工作。今天，全社出动了一百三十多个选种队员。在一块地里记者看到有一个姑娘像绣花一样的专心，用灵巧的手把硕大的麦穗剪下来，一会儿就剪满了一篮，别人告诉我说：她就是已经有了两年选种经验的选种能手刘铁妞。
    这个社的中共支部书记刘应祥是一个种子专家，他研究小麦的优良品种已经有四、五年的历史了。去年，他精选的品种就有七种，今年，他又选出了三十七种各种自然杂交的优良品种。上午，记者和他一路出发到伊河南岸去检查工作，一路上，他就选了一把麦穗，有时，他看到选种队的姑娘们，选了不好的种子，当场就给她们上课，传授选种的技术。记者和刘应祥回到社办公室的路上，迎面走来了社长刘光聚，他老远就挥舞着一束刚摘下来的麦穗，原来刘光聚今天一早就到麦地里去选种去了，一会儿功夫，凭着他的经验，就选了二十五个大穗，最少的有八十多粒，最大的穗有一百一十多粒，二寸多长，饱满的麦仁都快要滚出来了，刘应祥接过来一看说：真是好种，留下来，秋后种到试验田里去。刘光聚内行的告诉周围观看的人们说：这种穗子看样子是碧蚂一号和新农六二八，或碧蚂四号自然杂交的。他还说：大田里选出来的自然杂交品种，要比人工杂交的品种好得多，适应性更强。
    这一天，社里十多个选种队，一共选了一千多斤种子，随着麦子的大丰收，他们将更广泛的展开选种活动，这个社计划今年要选出小麦良种五万斤，保证秋种每亩有二十五斤优良种子。（附图片）
