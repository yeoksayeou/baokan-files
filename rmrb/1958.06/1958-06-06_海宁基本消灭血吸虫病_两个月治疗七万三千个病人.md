Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou - Haining County, one of the counties in Zhejiang Province most severely affected by schistosomiasis, had basically eliminated the disease by the end of May. This is the first major county in Zhejiang Province to eliminate schistosomiasis.

Haining County has a population of 390,000, and as many as 77,000 people suffer from schistosomiasis. The original plan was to basically eliminate the disease within this year. However, after two months of day and night hard work by the people of the entire county, 73,000 patients who could be treated with antimony agents have been treated, reaching 94.8% of the total number of patients. In the past five years, only 7,000 people were treated in total. At the same time, in conjunction with the manure accumulation campaign, snail-infested riverbanks covering five million square meters throughout the county have been buried with soil and treated with drugs three to four times.

The great leap forward in the thinking of medical personnel has played a significant role in eliminating schistosomiasis. In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, they have taken treatment groups deep into villages and households, delivering treatment to people's doorsteps, greatly facilitating the farmers. After two months of work, the entire county has now achieved the goal of having hospitals in every township and health stations in every commune, laying a good foundation for the complete elimination of schistosomiasis.

　　海宁基本消灭血吸虫病
    两个月治疗七万三千个病人
    新华社杭州讯　浙江省流行血吸虫病最严重的县份之一海宁县已在5月底基本上消灭了血吸虫病。这是浙江省第一个消灭血吸虫病的大县。
    海宁县有人口三十九万人，血吸虫病患者却有七万七千人之多，原计划在今年年内基本上消灭血吸虫病。但经全县人民两个月的日夜苦战后，已对能用锑剂治疗的七万三千个病人进行了治疗，达病人总数的94.8％。而过去五年才总共治疗了七千人。同时，全县结合积肥运动，对五百万平方公尺有钉螺的河滨进行了三至四次土埋与药物处理。
    医务人员的思想大跃进，对消灭血吸虫病起了很大作用。他们为了适应生产大跃进的需要，把治疗组深入到村、户中间，把治疗送上门去，大大方便了农民。经过两个月的工作，现在，全县已做到了乡乡有医院，社社有保健站，为彻底消灭血吸虫病打下良好的基础。
