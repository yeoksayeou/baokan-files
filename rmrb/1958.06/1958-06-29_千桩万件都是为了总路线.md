Thousands of Tasks, Millions of Pieces, All for the General Line
Yang Xuan

These days, with the thorough implementation of the General Line, many street women have also started industrial and service undertakings! It's bustling everywhere. Auntie Liang from No. 24 recently joined the work at the street nursery. These past two days, she's been grinning from ear to ear whenever she sees someone, constantly muttering, "This time, I can finally contribute to socialist construction!"

But just when everyone is working enthusiastically, Auntie Chen from No. 28 doesn't say a word when she sees people, as if she has a lot on her mind. Yesterday, she finally told me what was bothering her. It turns out that Auntie Chen only wants to participate in some clean and neat industrial production work and doesn't want to go to nurseries, canteens... places like that. She said, "At home, I'm taking care of children and working around the stove. When I go out, I'm still taking care of children and working around the stove. What's the point? Some processing jobs involve sorting and cleaning up rags, which are dirty. I'm not after that little bit of money."

With the great leap forward in socialist production, it's certainly good that housewives can directly participate in production and contribute more to building socialism. However, since some people have joined production, they must be freed from household chores. Therefore, running nurseries, canteens, and other service-oriented work has become a welfare undertaking to help them actively participate in production. So, while it may seem like just cooking and taking care of children, participating in the work of collectively run nurseries and canteens is no longer working for one's own family but serving more people. That is to say, we have done our part in realizing the General Line. Furthermore, even if some industrial production needs to be organized by the streets, it should be done according to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. Everything should be done simply and economically, and waste should be found and utilized as much as possible. Waste is what people used to throw into dusty piles of junk. Now, when we find and reuse it, it's bound to be messy, broken, and dusty. Although doing these jobs can get some wages and help increase family income, the more important thing is that these thousands of tasks and millions of pieces of odd jobs are, in the final analysis, all for the General Line. So, even if we are "not after that little bit of money," for the sake of industry, for the sake of agriculture, for the sake of the needs of the whole people, in short, for the sake of realizing our General Line, we should no longer be picky and choosy in the all-round great leap forward, and we should no longer wait!

    千桩万件都是为了总路线
    杨萱
    这些天，随着总路线的深入贯彻，许多街道妇女们也兴办起工业和服务事业来啦！到处闹得轰轰烈烈。二十四号的梁大妈最近也参加了街道托儿所的工作。这两天，她一见了人总是乐的合不上嘴，不停地叨咕：“这回总算给社会主义建设使上一把劲啦！”
    可是就在这大伙干得热火朝天的时候，二十八号的陈阿姨见了人也不言语，好像有满腹心事似的。昨天她才对我说了心里话。原来陈阿姨只想参加一些干净俐落的工业生产工作，不愿到托儿所呀，食堂呀……这些地方去作事。她说：“在家是带孩子围着锅台转，出门还是带孩子、围着炉台转，这算个啥？有些加工活儿，又是整理和拆洗破烂的事，不干不净的，我不图挣那几个钱。”
    社会主义生产大跃进，家庭妇女能够直接参加生产，更多地为建设社会主义出力，当然很好。但是，既然有一部分人参加了生产，就得使这部分人能够摆脱家务劳动。因此，办托儿所、办食堂等服务性工作，也就成为帮助她们积极参加生产的福利事业了。所以看起来同样是做饭、带孩子，可是参加了集体办的托儿所和食堂的工作，就不再是为自己一家一户作活，而是为更多的人服务了。也就是说，咱们在实现总路线中尽了一份力。再说，即使有些工业生产需要街道来举办，也都要依照多快好省的谱来做。事事都应该因陋就简和尽量寻找和利用废物。废物都是过去被人扔在积满灰尘的破烂堆里的，现在重新寻来利用，免不了零乱破碎多尘垢。虽然说，做这些工作就能得到一些工资报酬，对增加家庭收入也有一些帮助，但是更重要的是这千桩万件零碎活，归根结底都是为了总路线。所以即使“不图挣那几个钱”，为了工业，为了农业，为了全民需要，总之一句话，为了实现我们的总路线，我们在全面大跃进中，不要再挑肥拣瘦，不要再等待了！
