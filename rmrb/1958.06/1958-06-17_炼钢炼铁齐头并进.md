    Steelmaking and Iron Smelting Advance Simultaneously

    Industry, developing with the force of ten thousand horses galloping, has an increasing and more urgent need for steel. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient steel supply in the great leap forward of industrial production, various localities have vigorously established many medium and small-sized iron smelting blast furnaces and built some steel smelting open-hearth furnaces in a few months. Many provinces and counties with the conditions have also achieved the blossoming of small blast furnaces everywhere. This will undoubtedly play a significant role in rapidly increasing China's steel production. However, except for the large-scale steel plants established by the central government, the development speed of local steel smelting industry is still slower than that of iron smelting industry. The main reason is that people think steelmaking is more difficult than iron smelting, and it cannot be done without more complex equipment and higher technology. Therefore, how to unravel the mystery of steelmaking, break the mysterious view that steelmaking is unattainable, and make small steel smelting furnaces bloom everywhere like small iron smelting furnaces, and let molten steel and molten iron flow everywhere is indeed an important task at present.

    Is steelmaking really unattainable? Is it really impossible without more complex equipment and higher technology? No. If anyone doesn't believe it, please see the news items published in this newspaper today: Jinan Shengjian Machinery Factory successfully made steel by building its own small Bessemer converter; Yang Caishui, a worker at the Ji'an Highway Transportation Bureau Automobile Maintenance Plant in Jiangxi, and young technician Liu Junxin made steel using indigenous methods; Fuzhou General Machinery Factory in Fujian Province successfully made steel using a self-made small Bessemer furnace; and the converter newly built by Yuxi Iron Factory in Yunnan has also produced steel. Yang Caishui and Liu Junxin of the Ji'an Highway Transportation Bureau Automobile Maintenance Plant are not high-level technicians. The design and successful use of indigenous converters for steelmaking at the Fuzhou General Machinery Factory were also done by ordinary technical workers who were not originally steelmaking workers. Where is there any talk of superb technology? It is only because they are not superstitious, do not underestimate themselves, and dare to think and act that they quickly went from not knowing to knowing, creating miracles and opening up the road for us to develop small-scale steelmaking. Many things that experts and scholars can do or even cannot do, we ordinary people can also do. If these few ordinary people can do it, why can't we all do it?

    Although these small steel smelting furnaces are small in scale, their role and significance are very huge: first, it can solve the problem of steel supply that local factories are currently feeling urgently insufficient; second, and more importantly, this kind of indigenous converter has a simple structure, is easy to use, has low cost, and is easy to promote and build universally. As long as we do not wholeheartedly yearn for large steel plants, start from reality, and build dozens, hundreds, or thousands of small steel smelting furnaces, small can become large. It is understood that for the construction of steel smelting workshops of the same scale, the investment in converters is about 50% lower than that of open-hearth furnaces, and the construction speed is half a year to a year faster; for furnaces of the same tonnage, the output of converters is ten times higher than that of open-hearth furnaces. Therefore, these converters will become important production tools for China's development of steelmaking industry.

    We believe that not only in places with indigenous blast furnace iron smelting equipment, can indigenous steel smelting furnaces be established at the same time to achieve simultaneous advancement of iron smelting and steelmaking, so that steel production can also be obtained locally, smelted locally, and supplied locally to meet the needs of steel for the vigorous development of local industries in various places. At the same time, in all factories and enterprises with molten iron equipment, indigenous steel smelting furnaces or larger converters can also be established for steelmaking and casting steel parts, so that China's steelmaking industry can also achieve simultaneous development of large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, and blossom everywhere on a wider scale. In this way, it will not only promote China's steel production to develop more rapidly than the current speed, but also accelerate the development of other industries along with the development of steel production.

    炼钢炼铁齐头并进
    以万马奔腾之势发展着的工业，对钢铁的需要量越来越多，越来越迫切。各地为了克服工业生产大跃进中的钢铁供应不足的困难，在几个月中风起云涌地创办了许多中、小型的炼铁高炉和建立一些炼钢平炉，许多有条件的省和县还已作到了小高炉遍地开花。这对迅速增加我国钢铁产量无疑将起重大作用。但是，除了中央创办的大型钢厂外，各地炼钢工业的发展速度还是比炼铁工业缓慢。主要的原因，是人们认为炼钢比炼铁难，没有较复杂的设备和较高的技术不行。因此，如何揭开炼钢之谜，破除炼钢高不可攀的神秘观点，让小型炼钢炉跟小型炼铁炉一样，遍地开花，让钢水和铁水到处奔流，实在是当前的一个重要任务。
    炼钢是不是高不可攀的呢？是不是非要较复杂的设备和较高的技术不可呢？不。谁不相信，请看本报今天发表的几条消息吧：济南生建机械厂自建贝氏小转炉炼钢成功，江西吉安公路运输局汽车保养场工人杨才水和青年技术员刘钧信用土法炼钢，福建省福州通用机器厂用自制的小型贝氏炉炼钢成功，云南玉溪铁工厂新建的转炉也已出钢。吉安公路运输局汽车保养场的杨才水和刘钧信都不是什么高级技术人员。福州通用机器厂设计和利用土转炉炼钢成功的，也是一般技术工人，原来都不是炼钢工人。这哪里谈得上什么高超的技术，只因为他们不迷信，不妄自菲薄，敢想敢干，所以就很快地由不懂到懂，创造了奇迹，为我们开拓了发展小型炼钢的道路。许多专家学者能够做到的甚至做不到的事，我们一般人也能做到，这几个平凡的人能够做到的事，我们大家为什么做不到呢？
    虽然这些小炼钢炉规模小，但其作用和意义却非常巨大：第一，它能解决各地工厂当前亟感不足的钢材供应问题；第二，更其重要的还在于这种土转炉构造简单、使用方便、成本低、便于普遍推广和建造。只要不一心向往大型钢厂，从实际出发，建设几十个几百个几千个小型炼钢炉，小就可以变大。据了解，建设规模相同的炼钢车间，转炉的投资要比平炉低50％左右，建设速度要快半年到一年；相同吨位的炉子，转炉产量要比平炉高十倍。因此，这些转炉将成为我国发展炼钢工业的重要的生产工具。
    我们认为，不但在有土高炉炼铁设备的地方，可以同时建立土炼钢炉，做到炼铁和炼钢齐头并进，使钢材生产也能就地取材、就地炼制、就地供应，满足各地地方工业蓬勃发展后用钢的需要，同时在一切有熔铁设备的工厂企业也可以建立土炼钢炉或较大的转炉，用来炼钢和铸造钢制机件，使我国的炼钢工业也能在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，做到大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，在更广的范围内遍地开花。这样，它将不但促进我国钢产量能比现有的速度更快地突飞猛进的发展，同时还将使其他工业随着钢铁产量的发展而加快地发展。
