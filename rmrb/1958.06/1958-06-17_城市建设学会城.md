    Learn from the City Construction of Hui Cheng
    Wu Lü
    In the past, some people thought that urban construction always cost a lot of money. Building roads, repairing sewers, building cultural palaces, running hospitals, opening parks, and doing greening all cost money! Newspapers once published an account: for every additional person in the city population, the state needs to increase welfare facilities and municipal engineering costs by 558 to 695 yuan. Therefore, in the minds of these people, urban construction cannot be done in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. To be more, faster, and better, one cannot save; to save, one cannot be more, faster, and better.
    The construction of Huicheng Town, the county seat of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has shattered this erroneous argument that "urban construction cannot be more, faster, better, and more economical." Indeed, building a city always costs money; but spending very little can still build a city very well. Look! Huicheng Town, which suffered serious damage from the war, has become "a county town that can be said to have reached the international level" after only a few years of construction since liberation. Aren't the facilities in the city, such as auditoriums, hospitals, cultural palaces, theaters, exhibition halls, zoos, and swimming pools, all available in Huicheng Town? And the money spent is very little; some projects have even been completed without spending any money. Who can still say that urban construction cannot be more, faster, better, and more economical?
    The most fundamental reason why urban construction can certainly be done in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, just like other socialist construction undertakings, is that urban construction is also a matter for the people themselves. Our cities are the cities of the people. Who doesn't want to build their city more conveniently and beautifully? Who doesn't want a smooth road and a row of refreshing green trees in front of their house? Who doesn't want their city to have parks and theaters? The people's urgent demand for urban construction contains endless power. Moreover, with the development of urban production, this demand is becoming more urgent and this power is becoming stronger. As long as we organize this force, there is nothing we cannot do. The problem is that some comrades only see the people's urgent demand for urban construction, but do not realize that this demand itself is a force. In their opinion, urban construction is not the people's own business, so they can only wait for the state to pay for it and let the state handle it, and the result is of course that it cannot be more, faster, better, and more economical.
    After solving the ideological problem of waiting for the state to build the city or organizing the people to build the city themselves, it is also necessary to solve the construction policy problem. Is it about extravagance and superficiality, or about practicality and economy? Extravagance can never be more, faster, better, and more economical, and can never meet the people's requirements for urban construction. Even if the power of the masses is organized, it can only waste the power of the masses. Urban construction is not for an architect to "leave a name for eternity," but for the needs of people's lives, so its primary principle is always practicality. Our country's economic situation is not very rich, and the people's living standards are not very high. There are still many things we have to do, so we must seek economy.
    Huicheng Town has set a good example for urban construction, especially the construction of small and medium-sized cities. I hope that all cities that are being built and will be built will learn from Huicheng!

    城市建设学会城
    吴滤
    过去，有些人以为城市建设总是花钱很多的事情，筑马路、修上下水道、建文化宫、办医院、辟公园、搞绿化等等，哪一项不要花钱！报纸上就曾公布过一笔账：城市人口每增加一个人，国家就需要增加福利设施和市政工程等费用五百五十八元到六百九十五元。于是，在这些人的心目中，城市建设是不可能多快好省的。要多、要快、要好，就不能省；要省，就不能多、不能快、不能好。
    广东省新会县县城会城镇的建设，打破了这种“城市建设不能多快好省”的错误论调。确实，建设一个城市总是要花钱的；但花得很省，也一样可以把城市建设得很好。你看！遭受到战争严重破坏的会城镇，解放后短短几年的建设，已成为“可以说是达到了国际水平的一个县城”。礼堂、医院、文化宫、戏院、展览馆、动物园、游泳池等城市里的设施，会城镇不都有吗？而钱呢，花得很少；有些项目，甚至没有花钱也办了起来。谁还能说城市建设不能多快好省？
    城市建设所以一定能够做到多快好省，正像其他各项社会主义建设事业一样，最根本的原因，是因为城市建设事业也是人民群众自己的事情。我们的城市，是人民的城市。谁不希望把自己的城市建设得更加方便、更加美丽？谁不希望自己的家门口有一条平坦的马路、有一行触目清心的绿树？谁不希望自己的城市有公园、有戏院？人民群众这种对城市建设的迫切要求，蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量。而且，随着城市生产事业的发展，这种要求更加迫切，这种力量也更加强大了。只要我们把这种力量组织起来，没有任何事情是我们不能做到的。问题是有些同志只看到人民群众对城市建设的迫切要求，而没有认识到这种要求本身就是一种力量。在他们看来，城市建设不是人民群众自己的事业，因而只能等国家出钱，由国家来办，结果当然不能多快好省。
    解决了等国家来建设城市，还是组织人民群众自己来建设城市的思想问题之后，还要解决建设的方针问题。是讲阔气图表面、还是讲实用求节约。讲阔气永远不能多快好省，永远不能满足人民群众对城市建设的要求，即便把群众的力量组织起来了，也只能浪费群众的力量。城市建设不是为了那一位建筑家“留名千古”，而是为了人民生活的需要，因而它的首要原则总是实用。我们国家的经济情况还不很富裕，人民的生活水平也还不高，我们要做的事情还很多，因而更必须求节约。
    会城镇已经为城市建设特别是中小城市的建设树立了良好的榜样，希望一切正在建设和将要建设的城市都来学会城！
