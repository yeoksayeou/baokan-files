    The Joy of Harvest  The Power of Labor
    Henan Three Thousand Million People Mobilized to Harvest Wheat
    Harvested over Fifty Million Mu of Wheat Despite Wind and Rain
    (Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 3rd dispatch) The entire labor force of over 30 million people in Henan Province has been mobilized to fully harvest the abundant wheat crop despite wind and rain. Starting from May 30th, until 9:00 PM tonight, over 50 million mu of wheat (including the previously harvested 15 million mu of barley, peas, and other crops) has been harvested. The Xinyang and Nanyang regions have harvested approximately 80% of their wheat crop area. The weather began to improve on the 2nd, making the wheat harvesting work even smoother.
    Based on the current harvesting results in various areas, Neixiang County, where wheat production has significantly increased this year, has 420,000 mu of wheat, most of which has doubled last year's production, and some has increased by two to three times. In Yanshi County, the wheat already harvested on the mountain slopes has generally increased by more than double compared to last year, with some areas increasing by up to two times. Many places throughout the province have also reported large-scale high-yield records of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu.
    To ensure a quick and good wheat harvest, over 5 million farmers from economic crop areas, areas where wheat matures later, and areas with less land and more labor have demonstrated a high degree of communist cooperation, bringing their own tools and rations to rush to the wheat harvesting areas to help with the harvest. Over 1 million cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and students throughout the province have organized wheat harvesting volunteer armies or expedition teams to participate in the wheat harvesting battle.
    After the comprehensive start of wheat harvesting in Henan Province on May 30th, the weather was intermittently overcast and rainy, and some areas experienced heavy rain and strong winds. To ensure a bumper wheat harvest, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee made specific arrangements and called on farmers in various regions to urgently rush to harvest overnight. On the evening of May 30th, nearly 10 million people participated in the rush harvest in the rain, harvesting over 6 million mu of wheat in the middle of the night. On May 31st, the rush harvesting movement rapidly spread throughout the province, involving 20 to 30 million people in the army rushing to harvest wheat, harvesting over 25 million mu of wheat. By June 1st, the cumulative amount of wheat harvested throughout the province had reached over 40 million mu, accounting for approximately half of the wheat field area. Most of the wheat that had already matured had been harvested. The Xinyang region, where wheat harvesting and threshing are progressing quickly and well, has now mobilized over 4 million people, equivalent to more than three times the number of daily workers in the past. Two hundred trucks and over 30,000 carts participated in transporting wheat overnight, and over 100,000 people from government agencies, military units, enterprises, and urban residents supported the wheat harvest. A total of 5.39 million mu of wheat was rushed to harvest in one day and one night, more than 1.7 million mu more than the total amount of wheat harvested in the past six days.
    These days, in Henan Province, from the western mountainous areas to the eastern Henan plains, from the north and south of the Huai River to both banks of the Yellow River, the battle slogans for summer harvesting and summer planting are spreading everywhere: "Men and women go into battle together, set up a large camp in the fields," "Work hard, work earnestly, and work practically, fight hard for ten days, and get through the busy wheat season." The broad masses sing ditties such as "Wheat is better than sorghum, the ears are big and long, the seeds are numerous and plump, and it's the same everywhere" to praise the grand occasion of this year's Henan wheat harvest. Farmers in various regions have also put forward the slogans of quick harvesting and quick threshing, returning every grain to the home. Party and government leaders in many places have also summarized and disseminated experiences in a timely manner to guide farmers in carrying out harvesting and threshing work simultaneously. The Henan Provincial People's Committee requires all regions to pay attention to seed selection during rush harvesting and threshing, and to select as many superior varieties as possible; at the same time, high-yield wheat should also be harvested and threshed separately to summarize experience and strive for an even greater wheat harvest in 1959.
    The characteristics of this year's summer harvest and summer planting in Henan, in addition to the good wheat, heavy tasks, and full enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, is that the various preparatory work done beforehand has been more adequate than in previous years. In summary, there are "ten goods" in the preparation for this year's summer harvest and summer planting: First, the ideological mobilization of the masses is good; second, the planning of the summer harvest and summer planting is good; third, the harvesting and planting tools have been improved; fourth, socialist large-scale cooperation is well done; fifth, the arrangement of agricultural work is good; sixth, the organization of labor is good; seventh, the farm canteens and nurseries are well run; eighth, the arrangement of the people's lives is good; ninth, the support from government agencies, military units, and schools is good; and tenth, the coordination of economic departments is good.

    丰收的喜悦  劳动的威力
    河南三千万人出动割麦
    风雨无阻地收割了麦子五千多万亩
    本报郑州3日电  河南省三千多万名劳动大军全部上阵，风雨无阻地全面收割丰产麦子。从5月30日开始，到今天晚上九时止，已经收割麦子（包括前已收割的一千五百多万亩大麦、豌豆等作物）五千多万亩。信阳、南阳专区收割数量已占麦收作物面积的80％左右。2日开始天气好转，麦收工作的进行更为顺利。
    根据目前各地的收打结果情况来看，今年全省各地小麦增产显著的内乡县四十二万亩小麦，大部较去年增产一倍，一部分增产二倍到三倍。偃师县已经收打完的山坡地小麦，一般也都比去年增产一倍以上，多的增产达两倍。全省不少地方还出现了亩产八百到一千斤的大面积丰产纪录。
    为保证小麦收快收好，五百多万名经济作物地区、小麦成熟较晚地区和地少劳力多的地区的农民，发扬了高度的共产主义协作精神，自带工具口粮赶往麦收地区帮助抢收。全省一百多万名机关干部、人民解放军官兵、学生，组织了麦收志愿军或远征队，参加了麦收的战斗。
    河南省收割小麦在5月30日全面开始后，天气时阴时雨，部分地区还发生暴雨大风。为保证小麦丰产丰收，中共河南省委和省人民委员会进行了具体部署，并号召各地农民连夜紧急抢收。5月30日晚，冒雨参加抢收的群众有近一千万人，半夜共收割小麦六百余万亩。5月31日，抢收运动迅速扩及全省，卷入抢收小麦的大军达到两三千万人，抢收麦子二千五百多万亩。到6月1日止，全省累计已经收割的麦子就有四千多万亩，约占麦田面积一半，凡是已经成熟的，大部已收割完了。收麦打麦进行得又快又好的信阳专区，现动员起来的群众有四百多万人，相当于过去每日出勤人数的三倍多，连夜参加运麦的汽车二百辆、架子车三万多辆，机关、部队、企业部门和城镇市民，支援收麦的人数达十万多人。一天一夜共抢收麦子五百三十九万亩，比过去六天收麦的总数多一百七十多万亩。
    这几天，河南省从西部山区到豫东平原，从淮河南北到黄河两岸，到处传扬夏收夏种的战斗口号：“男女齐出阵，田间扎大营”，“苦干硬干踏实干，大战十数天，闯过麦忙关”。广大群众在劳动中唱着“麦子赛高粱，穗儿大又长，籽多又饱满，遍地都一样”等顺口溜，来歌颂今年河南麦子丰收的盛况。各地农民还提出了快收快打、颗粒还家的口号。许多地方的党政领导，也都及时地总结和传布经验，指导农民进行随收随打工作。河南省人民委员会要求各地在抢收抢打时，注意选种工作，把优良品种尽量选出来；同时，高额丰产的小麦也要设法单收单打，以便总结经验，争取1959年小麦更大丰收。
    今年河南夏收夏种的特点，除了麦子好，任务大，干部、群众干劲十足以外，事前各项准备工作做得充分也是历年来所没有的。综合起来，今年夏收夏种准备有“十大好”：一是群众思想发动好；二是夏收夏种规划的好；三是收种工具改良的好；四是社会主义大协作做的好；五是农活安排的好；六是劳动力组织的好；七是农忙食堂和托儿所办的好；八是群众生活安排的好；九是机关、部队、学校支援的好；十是经济部门配合的好。（附图片）
