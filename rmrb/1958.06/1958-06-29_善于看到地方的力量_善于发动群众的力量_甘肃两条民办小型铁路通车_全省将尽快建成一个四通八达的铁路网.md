    Good at Seeing Local Strengths, Good at Mobilizing the Masses
    Two Private Small Railways Open to Traffic in Gansu Province
    The Whole Province Will Soon Build a Rail Network with Easy Access to All Parts
    (Our dispatch from Lanzhou, June 28th) Reporter Ma Linzhou reports: Gansu Province has proposed a plan to build 10,000 kilometers of small railways, setting a national banner for railways built by all the people.
    On June 16th and 18th, the first two private small railways appeared and have been completed and opened to traffic in Guanbao Town, Weiyuan County, and Zhangye County. The railway in Weiyuan County is five kilometers long. The locomotive is converted from a car engine, can haul eight carriages, carry more than 40 tons, and travel at a speed of more than 30 kilometers per hour. Each train can replace more than a dozen cars. The other railway is in Zhangye County, it's eleven kilometers long, the locomotive is converted from a ten-horsepower gasoline engine, hauls five carriages, and carries 15 tons.
    These two railways were built by relying on the masses and using local materials. The five-kilometer railway in Weiyuan County didn't cost the state a penny. It relied on the masses to solve the problems of iron, wood, raw materials, and manpower, and was completed in only twenty days. The locomotive was converted from a car engine, and the carriages were made by local cadres and farmers imitating standard train carriages, using local iron and wood raw materials. The iron used for the railway was all collected from folk scrap iron and waste iron, and cast into iron rails by the local foundry. The roadbed of this railway is four meters wide, the gravel is thirty centimeters thick, the rail gauge is one meter, and each rail weighs 33 kilograms. The technology is simple and the cost is low. In order to create experience, in addition to iron rails, they also laid part of wooden rails with iron sheets nailed on them. After trial runs, it was proved that iron rails are better, and it was decided to use cast iron rails in large quantities in the future. According to a typical investigation, each household in the county has an average of about fifty kilograms of scrap iron. With ancient bells and waste iron, the county can collect four million kilograms, which can lay 120 kilometers of railway. An iron mine that has been discovered in the county has been decided to be mined and smelted using indigenous methods immediately to ensure the completion of the construction of 400 kilometers of railway in the next two years. The railway will connect most of the county's industries, mines, towns, and 70% to 80% of the communes, forming a railway transportation network.
    On June 18th, the members of the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting after attending the opening ceremony of the small railway in Guanbao Town, Weiyuan County. The meeting believed that this kind of small railway built by relying on local resources and the masses is a direction for the future, and decided to build small railways throughout the province. Through this measure, the province's railway construction will also combine large, medium, and small sizes, and strive to quickly build a rail network with easy access to all parts of the province. At the on-site meeting, it was officially determined that the province will rely on the masses and use local materials to build 10,000 kilometers of medium and small railways in the next three years. At the meeting, the four special districts of Dingxi, Zhangye, Tianshui, and Pingliang alone reported plans to build 8,100 kilometers of railway, and strive to complete it by the end of next year.
    With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, Gansu Province has placed increasingly heavy tasks on the transportation industry. Ancient transportation tools can no longer meet the new requirements, and it is very necessary to build such a small railway. The completion of the two small railways in Weiyuan County and Zhangye County has set a banner for private railways. Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, comprehensively analyzed and summarized the role and significance of this railway at the opening ceremony of the small railway in Weiyuan. He pointed out that since China has had railways, the laying of railways has been done by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. After liberation, it was also entirely invested and built by the state. Building railways in a county relying on the strength of the masses was not only unheard of and unseen in the past, but even unimaginable. However, under the encouragement of the general line of socialist construction, the people of Weiyuan broke this convention, broke with superstition, dared to boldly imagine, bravely innovated, and created such an unprecedented miracle. He said: The completion and opening of this railway not only marks a great leap forward in the transportation industry, but also a great leap forward in the technological revolution. It points out a new direction for our railway construction industry. From now on, not only will the state invest in building railways, but the strength of the masses can also be used to build railways. This combination of large, medium, and small railways will make railway construction faster, better, and more economical, with both a backbone and a network, so that the railway transportation network can be formed more quickly.

### 善于看到地方的力量　善于发动群众的力量  甘肃两条民办小型铁路通车  全省将尽快建成一个四通八达的铁路网

    善于看到地方的力量　善于发动群众的力量
    甘肃两条民办小型铁路通车
    全省将尽快建成一个四通八达的铁路网
    本报兰州28日电　记者马林周报道：甘肃省提出了建小型铁路一万公里的规划，给全国树起了全民办铁路的旗帜。
    6月16日和18日，最先出现的两条民办小型铁路，已在渭源县的官堡镇和张掖县建成通车。渭源县的一条铁路长五公里，机车是用汽车引擎改装成的，可拖带八个车皮，载重四十多吨，时速三十多公里，每一列车可代替十几辆汽车。另一条铁路是张掖县的，长十一公里，机车是用十马力的汽油发动机改装成的，拖带五个车皮，载重十五吨。
    这两条铁路都是依靠群众，就地取材建设起来的。渭源县的五公里铁路没花国家一文钱，依靠群众解决了铁、木原料和人力等问题，只用二十天就建成了。机车是用汽车引擎改装的，车皮是当地干部和农民仿照正规火车皮，利用当地铁木原料制成的。铁路用铁都是收集民间废铁烂铁，由当地翻砂厂铸制成的铁轨。这条铁路路基宽四公尺，石子厚三十公分，轨宽一公尺，每根轨重三十三公斤。技术简单，造价低廉。他们为了创造经验，除铁轨外，还铺了一部分木轨，上钉铁皮。经过试车证明，铁轨较好，决定今后大量采用铸铁轨。据典型调查，县内民间每户平均有五十斤左右的废铁，加上古钟烂铁，全县可以收集四百万斤，能铺设一百二十公里铁路。县内已发现的一处铁矿，已决定立即用土法开采、炼铁，以保证今明两年完成四百公里铁路的建设任务，用铁路把全县大部分工矿、乡镇和70％到80％的社连起来，形成一个铁路运输网。
    6月18日，中共甘肃省委的常委委员在参加渭源县官堡镇小型铁路通车典礼之后，即举行了现场会议。会议认为，这种依靠地方依靠群众大办小型铁路是今后的一个方向，决定在全省范围内建设小型铁路。通过这一措施，使全省铁路建设也大、中、小型相结合，争取很快地在全省内建成一个四通八达的铁路网。在现场会议上，正式确定全省在今后三年内，依靠群众，就地取材，建设一万公里中小型铁路。会上，只是定西、张掖、天水、平凉四个专区，即自报建设八千一百公里铁路，而且要争取在明年年底完成。
    甘肃省随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，给交通运输事业提出了愈来愈繁重的任务，古老的运输工具已不能适应新的要求，很需要修建这样一种小型铁路。渭源县和张掖县两条小型铁路的建成，为民办铁路树立了一面旗帜。甘肃省委第一书记张仲良同志在渭源小型铁路通车典礼大会上，全面分析总结了这种铁路的作用和意义。他指出：我国自有铁路以来，铺设铁路都是由帝国主义和官僚资本主义来办的；解放以后，也完全是由国家投资建设的。在一个县内，依靠群众力量建筑铁路，过去不仅闻所未闻，见所未见，甚至连想也不敢想。但是渭源的人民在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，打破了这种常规，破除迷信，敢于大胆设想，勇敢独创，做出如此亘古未有的奇迹。他说：这条铁路的建成通车，不仅标志着交通运输事业的大跃进，而且是技术革命的一个大跃进。它给我们铁路建设事业指出了一个新的方向。从此以后，不光靠国家投资修建铁路，靠群众力量也可以修建铁路。这样大、中、小型铁路相结合，就使铁路建设更多更快更好更省，既有骨干，又有脉络，使铁路交通运输网更快地形成。
