Hard Struggle, Constant Leap Forward
Fujian's Early Rice Has Thick Stalks and Long Ears

    (Our dispatch) Fuzhou, June 15 (reporter Chen Qitong reports): Fujian Province's more than 8.7 million mu of early rice has already begun to grout and ripen, with the vast majority growing thick stalks and long ears, presenting a scene of unprecedented bumper harvest everywhere.
    According to the actual harvest results in some areas and the estimated yields in various places, this year's early rice output in the province will not only greatly increase with the expansion of the planting area, but also the average yield per unit area will have a greater increase than in any previous year. The average yield of early rice in Longxi and Jinjiang prefectures, the main rice-producing areas, will reach about 490 jin, an increase of more than 130 jin compared with last year; with the expansion of the planting area, the total output will increase by more than 65% compared with last year.
    The unprecedented good growth of early rice in Fujian Province this year is the result of the hard struggle of the broad masses of farmers in the great leap forward in agricultural production, implementing continuous revolution, continuous leap forward, and continuous reform of cultivation techniques. In the past winter and this spring, the province's farmers, with the heroic spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, launched an unprecedented large-scale movement to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, and improve soil, which lasted for several months, making the province's early rice planting area expand by 22.6% compared with last year, and the average fertilizer application increased by more than six times compared with last year. Many low-yielding fields have also been transformed into high-yielding fields after soil improvement and increased fertilizer application, laying a good foundation for this year's unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice. A cultivation technology innovation movement centered on early planting and close planting was launched in spring plowing production, ensuring that the early rice in all parts of the province could be planted one season earlier or in a timely manner this year, and generally achieved an increase of more than 20% in the number of seedlings planted per mu compared with last year, which has become an important factor in promoting this year's bumper harvest of early rice.
    However, this year's early rice production in Fujian Province has not been smooth sailing. Since the end of rice transplanting, various places have experienced rare pest and disease disasters due to the early heat this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than one million mu of early rice in the province have suffered from pests and diseases such as rice borers, rice blast, and rice planthoppers. However, with the close cooperation of various relevant departments and the vigorous efforts of the broad masses of farmers, the prevention and control policy of "treating early, treating universally, treating continuously, and treating thoroughly" was conscientiously implemented. Combined with field management such as weeding, topdressing, and preventing lodging, and with the vigorous use of a combination of pesticides and indigenous methods for prevention and control, pests and diseases in many places were quickly extinguished as soon as they occurred.
    Now, encouraged by the promising bumper harvest of early rice, the province's farmers are stepping up preparations for the tools and other materials needed for the summer harvest and summer planting, while continuing to persistently strengthen field management, prevent lodging, prevent and control pests and diseases, prevent wind, and prevent floods, to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice this year.

### 艰苦奋战　不断跃进  福建早稻秆粗穗长

    艰苦奋战　不断跃进
    福建早稻秆粗穗长
    本报讯　记者陈启桐报道：福建省八百七十多万亩早稻已经开始灌浆、黄熟，绝大部分长得秆粗穗长，到处呈现一片空前大丰收的景象。
    根据目前部分地区收获实绩和各地估产看来，全省今年早稻产量不但将随着种植面积的扩大而大大增加，同时单位平均产量也将比以往任何一年有更大的增长。主要水稻产区的龙溪、晋江两专区的早稻平均产量都将达到四百九十斤左右，比去年可增产一百三十斤以上；再加种植面积扩大，总产量将比去年增加65％以上。
    福建省今年的早稻生长空前良好，是各地广大农民在农业生产大跃进中艰苦奋战，实行不断革命、不断跃进、不断进行耕作技术改革的结果。在去冬今春，全省农民曾以移山倒海的英雄气概，掀起了一个持续达数月之久的空前规模的兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤运动，使全省早稻种植面积比去年扩大了22.6％，平均施肥量比去年增加了六倍多，许多低产田在经过改良土壤、增加施肥量后，也都变成了高产田，为今年早稻空前丰收打下了良好基础。在春耕生产中掀起了一个以早插和密植为中心的栽培技术革新运动，保证了全省各地今年早稻都能提前一个季节或适时插下秧苗，并普遍作到了每亩田插秧丛数比去年增加两成以上，成为促成今年早稻大丰收的重要因素。
    但是，福建省今年早稻生产并不是一帆风顺的。从插秧结束以来，各地都曾因今年气候热得早，发生了解放以来少见的病虫灾害。据不完全统计，全省有一百万多亩的早稻发生螟虫、稻热病、稻飞虱等病虫灾害，但在各有关部门密切配合和广大农民鼓足干劲，认真贯彻了“及早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的防治方针，结合中耕除草、追肥和防倒伏等田间管理工作，采用农药械和土法相结合大力进行防治下，许多地方的病虫害刚一发生就迅速被扑灭了。
    现在，全省农民正在早稻可望大丰收的鼓舞下，一面加紧准备夏收夏种所需的工具和其他物资，一面继续坚持不懈地加强田间管理、防止倒伏和防治病虫害、防风、防洪等工作，以确保今年早稻大丰收。
