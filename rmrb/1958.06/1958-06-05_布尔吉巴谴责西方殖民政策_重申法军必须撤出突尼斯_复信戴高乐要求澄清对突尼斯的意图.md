    Xinhua News Agency, Tunis: On June 2nd, de Gaulle, through the French Chargé d'Affaires in Tunisia, handed Tunisian President Bourguiba a letter. In the letter, de Gaulle vaguely expressed his desire to work with Bourguiba to resolve the current difficult issues between the two countries, and stated that "both governments must avoid anything that risks exacerbating the current situation," attempting to adopt a conciliatory stance towards Tunisia as he had just taken office and his position was not yet stable. However, de Gaulle did not indicate whether he agreed to withdraw troops.

    Tunisian President Bourguiba, in a brief reply to de Gaulle on the 3rd, requested de Gaulle to clarify his policies towards Tunisia. The letter stated that if normal relations between the two countries were to be restored, both sides must "clearly state their intentions."

    According to reports, the Tunisian official response to de Gaulle's private letter to Bourguiba was lukewarm, considering the letter to be "ambiguous."

    On the same day, in an interview with a reporter from the Italian newspaper "La Stampa," Bourguiba reiterated Tunisia's demand for the withdrawal of French troops. He said that Tunisian public opinion could no longer tolerate French troops stationed on its territory for long. He emphasized that "patience has its limits," and "regardless of de Gaulle or no de Gaulle, there is only one issue, and that is that French troops must leave Tunisia."

    When discussing the actions of Western countries in North Africa, Bourguiba not only condemned France, but also condemned the Western "bloc... especially the United States," saying that these countries had all made mistakes by supplying France with weapons to help it continue the war in Algeria.

    布尔吉巴谴责西方殖民政策
    重申法军必须撤出突尼斯
    复信戴高乐要求澄清对突尼斯的意图
    据新华社讯　突尼斯消息：6月2日，戴高乐通过法国驻突代办交给突尼斯总统布尔吉巴一封信。戴高乐在信中空泛地表示要同布尔吉巴一道解决两国之间目前的困难问题，并且说“两国政府必须避免有使目前局势恶化的危险的任何事情”，企图在他刚上台立足未稳的时候作出缓和同突尼斯关系的姿态。但是戴高乐没有表示是否同意撤军。
    突尼斯总统布尔吉巴3日在写给戴高乐的一封简短复信中，要求戴高乐澄清对突尼斯的政策。信里面说，如果要恢复两国之间的正常关系，双方必须“清楚阐明自己的意图”。
    据报道，突尼斯官方对戴高乐致布尔吉巴私人信件的反应很冷淡，认为这封信是“含糊的”。
    同一天，布尔吉巴在对意大利报纸“时报”记者发表的谈话中，重申突尼斯要求撤退法军。他说，突尼斯舆论不能再长久容忍法军驻在自己领土上。他强调说，“耐心是有限度的”，“不管戴高乐不戴高乐，问题只有一个，那就是法国部队必须撤离突尼斯”。
    布尔吉巴在谈到西方国家在北非的行动时不仅谴责了法国，而且也谴责西方“集团……尤其是美国”，他说这些国家都曾犯了错误，供给法国武器来帮助它继续在阿尔及利亚进行战争。
