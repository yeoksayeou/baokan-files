Xinhua News Agency reporter, Deng Guoxiang

    The reporter has traveled to many cities, but rarely seen a county town as beautiful and clean as Xinhui. The fragrant flowers placed in front of every household attract passersby. All the buildings are freshly painted, the snow-white and cream-colored walls set off by the green window lattices, appearing particularly soft. Many families have neatly arranged furniture, some looking as good as new. From the conversations of the housewives, the reporter learned that commercial work has created a miracle here. Their organized "Home Beautification Service Group" has made the greatest effort to create such a beautiful living environment, enabling many housewives to beautify their homes without spending a penny.
    The inspiring slogan of "Beautify Every Household" was put forward by the People's Committee of Huidong Town, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, during the patriotic health campaign at the beginning of this year. The Home Beautification Service Group unifies the contradiction between beautifying the home and managing the household diligently by purchasing waste products, and combines it with the patriotic health campaign, so it is extremely popular among the masses. This work started in Huidong Town and has now spread throughout the county. The county's forty-seven Home Beautification Service Groups have already beautified eight thousand four hundred and eighty-three households, and this year the goal is to beautify fifty thousand households. "Clean up waste, improve sanitation; keep household items tidy and beautiful; ensure houses are leak-proof and have plenty of sunshine; beautify every household, ensure everyone's health" are the purpose and content of home beautification.
    Huidong Town has two "Home Beautification Service Groups". Every morning, people can see them carrying toolboxes and heading to various neighborhoods to help residents beautify their homes. Some of them are experts in purchasing waste products, some are carpenters, some are architects, some are painters, and some are hardware repair workers.
    As the reporter passed a street, he encountered craftsman Zhong Wen, who was decorating He Yutian's house. The beams and pillars of He Yutian's building had been damaged by termites and were uninhabitable. The carpenter was replacing the beams for her and was also preparing to repaint the window frames, tables, and screens in her house. According to craftsman Zhong Wen, He Yutian's home beautification was influenced by her neighbor, Xie Qunxin. Xie Qunxin had a leaky house, and the service group not only repaired it for her, but also repaired her dilapidated tables, chairs, bookshelves, and doors and windows to look like new. The service group renovated so many things without requiring her to pay a single penny in cash; it simply purchased the waste products she cleared out and converted them into labor costs.
    The reporter visited many beautified homes, and they praised the service group endlessly. The central hall of Li Shuangyong's house has a pair of vermilion doors, which were converted from screens. She pointed to a new set of tables and chairs in the living room, and one could not tell that they were originally dilapidated items piled in a corner covered with dust. The dressing table in her bedroom has been painted purple. Li Shuangyong happily told the reporter: "The service group's labor costs are cheap, and their craftsmanship is skillful. The government's care for the people is truly meticulous."
    The service group personnel are very good at motivating residents to improve their living conditions. There is an old mansion in Huidong Town that has been beautified and houses seven families. Originally, the interior was dirty and messy, and everyone had different opinions on whether to beautify it or not. After discussing with the service group, the service group taught them in detail how to mix lime water to paint the walls, how to arrange things, and how to dismantle the crumbling wall in the backyard to build a flowerbed. Under the guidance of the service group, the ancient house is now bright and clean. Resident Zhong Shuting was getting married but did not have the money to buy furniture for the bridal chamber, so the service group helped him renovate a bed, a wardrobe, and a desk that his father had used, painting them light yellow. In this way, it cost a total of more than five yuan in labor costs, which he paid for with waste products, without spending a penny. This greatly moved his father. The old man said, "Now the government emphasizes thrift in everything. Thanks to the service group's help, the happy event for my family has added a lot of luster." After being beautified, the living environment of the families has changed to varying degrees. Roofs that used to leak no longer leak, and houses that were dark or lacked ventilation have been replaced with bright glass tiles or had windows opened. After working for a day, the owners feel relaxed and happy when they return to their comfortable homes. They thank the government for its good idea and thank the service group for its concern.
    "Turn broken things into good things, old things into new things, useless things into useful things, and use one thing in many ways." The staff of the service group understand how to use dialectical viewpoints to create wealth for society. When they beautify each family, they focus on thrift, so that all the discarded items of each family are put into use, serving life and serving production. Lin Bai, the head of the service group, told the reporter: "What is waste? Sometimes it depends on the environment. The same thing may be waste in one family, but it becomes a treasure in another family."
    The service group is under the leadership of the "Waste Utilization Store". In addition to the task of beautifying homes, the Waste Utilization Store often supplies the scrap iron collected from various households to agricultural tool factories to produce various agricultural tools. Some raw materials can also be supplied to other places. A purchasing agent from Shanghai recently purchased more than three thousand yuan worth of old wood from this store.

    美化家庭服务组
    新华社记者  邓国庠
    记者跑过了很多城市，但很少看到一个县的市镇有如新会城这样美丽清洁。家家户户门前摆着的芬香鲜花，吸引着行人。所有的楼房都粉刷一新，雪白的、奶黄色的墙壁，衬着绿色的窗格子，格外显得柔和。许多家庭陈设的家具都很整齐，有些看来像新的一样。从主妇们的谈论中，记者才知道商业工作已在这里创造了奇迹。他们组织的“美化家庭服务组”为创造这样幽美的居住环境尽了最大努力，使许多主妇不花一分钱就能把家庭美化起来。
    “户户美化家庭”的动人口号，是广东新会县城——会城镇人民委员会在今年初的爱国卫生运动中提出来的。美化家庭服务组通过收购废品把美化家庭与勤俭治家的矛盾统一起来，并结合爱国卫生运动，所以极受群众欢迎。这个工作从会城镇开始，现在已遍及全县。全县四十七个美化家庭服务组，现在已经把八千四百八十三户家庭美化起来，今年要求达到美化五万户家庭。“清理废品，清洁卫生；家庭用具，整齐美观；房屋无漏，阳光充足；户户美化，人人健康。”是美化家庭的目的和内容。
    会城镇有两个“美化家庭服务组”，每天早晨，人们就可以看到他们背着工具箱，分头到各街坊去，上门帮助居民美化家庭。他们有的是收购废品专家，有的是木匠，有的是建筑师，有的是油漆匠，有的是五金修理工人。
    记者经过一条街道时，正遇着工匠钟稳，他正为何玉甜修饰房子。何玉甜的楼房梁柱被白蚁蛀坏了，不能居住，木匠正在为它换梁，还准备把她家的窗框、桌子和屏门油漆一新。听工匠钟稳说，何玉甜美化家庭是因为受到邻里谢群馨家的影响，谢群馨有一间漏雨的房子，服务组不但替她修好了，而且还把她家破旧的枱椅、书柜和门窗修理如新。服务组修饰了这许多东西，完全不需要她付出一分现钱，只是把她家清理出来的废品收购起来，折算换取工费。
    记者访问了好多经过美化的家庭，他们对服务组称赞不已。李双用家的中堂有一对朱门，是用屏门改装的。她指给我看客厅上摆设着一副新枱椅，怎样也看不出它原来是堆在屋角积满灰尘的破旧东西。她寝室里的梳妆台，已油成紫红色。李双用愉快地对记者说：“服务组的工价便宜，手艺又巧，政府关心人民真是无微不至。”
    服务组的人员很善于鼓动居民改善居住条件。会城镇有一座经过美化的古老大屋，住有七户人家。原来室内肮脏、杂乱不堪，大家对美化不美化，意见不一。后经与服务组研究，服务组详细教他们怎样拌灰水粉刷墙壁，怎样布置，怎样把后园快塌的墙拆来砌花圃。在服务组的指导下，现在这古屋已是窗明几净了。居民钟树庭要结婚，又没有钱购置洞房的家具，服务组就帮助他把他父亲用的一张床、一个衣柜、一张书桌，修饰成淡黄色。这样，一共花了五元多工钱，他用废品来折付，一个钱都不用花。这件事大大感动了他的父亲。这老人家说：“现在政府什么都讲勤俭，多得服务组的帮助，给我家办的喜事增添了不少光彩”。经过美化了的家庭，居住环境都起了不同程度的变化。屋顶漏雨的不漏了，房子阴暗或空气不畅通的，换上了明亮的玻璃瓦或开了窗子。主人劳动了一天，回到舒适的家里，就感到心旷神怡。他们感谢政府的好主意，感谢服务组的操心。
    “破变好，旧变新，无用变有用，一用变多用。”服务组的职工很懂得运用辩证观点，为社会创造财富。他们替各家美化时，处处从俭着眼，使各家废置的东西，全都动用起来，为生活服务，为生产服务。服务组的负责人林柏对记者说：“什么是废品？有时要看环境而定。同样一个东西，在甲家是废物，在乙家就变成为宝物”。
    服务组属“废物利用商店”领导，废物利用商店除了美化家庭任务以外，经常将从各家收购起来的废铁供应给农具厂生产出各种农具。有的原料还可以供应外地，前几天从上海来的采购员，就在这商店购买了三千多元旧木材。
