　　Practical Publicity

    Currently, a high tide of publicizing the General Line is sweeping the country. The purpose of our publicity is not only to let the masses know the content of the General Line, but also to make the General Line produce a huge force in people's thinking and actions, and to promote everyone who knows the General Line to be able to exert full energy, strive for the upper reaches, and engage in socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Today, the news from Shanghai and Laibin Town in Laibin County, Taiping Township in Yishan County, Guangxi Province, and Changshu County in Jiangsu Province, published in this newspaper, which publicize the General Line, have played such a role. These places all used the advanced figures and advanced deeds in the local Great Leap Forward to carry out publicity. In this way, it is both vivid and specific. The masses' understanding of the General Line does not stay on the slogan of "exerting full energy and striving for the upper reaches...", but truly sees the living heroic figures in the Great Leap Forward, and sees the role models they should learn from. Therefore, after publicizing the General Line, a high tide of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced will soon appear. In this upsurge, more advanced figures and advanced deeds will emerge, which will more rapidly promote our socialist construction cause.

　　联系实际的宣传
    现在，全国各地都掀起了宣传总路线的高潮。我们宣传的目的不仅是让群众知道总路线的内容，而且要使总路线在人们的思想、行动上产生巨大的力量，促使每一个知道总路线的人，能够鼓足干劲、力争上游，能够多快好省地从事社会主义建设。
    今天本报发表的上海市和广西省来宾县来宾镇、宜山县太平乡、江苏省常熟县宣传总路线的消息，就起了这样的作用。这几个地方，都是运用了当地大跃进中的先进人物和先进事例进行宣传。这样，既生动又具体，群众对总路线的理解不是停留在“鼓足干劲、力争上游……”的口号上，而是真正看到了在大跃进中活生生的英雄人物，看到了自己应该学习的榜样。于是，在宣传总路线之后，很快地就会出现一个学先进、赶先进的热潮。在这个热潮中，将会涌现更多的先进人物和先进事例，这将更加迅速地推进我们的社会主义建设事业。
