Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the north are currently helping agricultural cooperatives to harvest wheat at a rate of 10 million mu per day. Troops stationed in the south, after reporting victories in the summer harvest, have also thrown themselves into summer planting. This is a new high tide of the People's Liberation Army's all-out support for agricultural production after helping farmers work hard all winter and make great efforts in spring.

This year, the summer harvest assistance by various units is more grand, more energetic, and more fruitful than in previous years. Before the wheat harvest, all units made full preparations, making sickles, buying farm tools, and preparing vehicles and horses. As soon as the wheat matured, all units stopped training and exercises, with commanders personally taking charge and all personnel, animals, and vehicles being dispatched. Some units also organized command posts to uniformly direct this large-scale summer harvesting activity. In the past, the troops provided "on-the-spot support"; this year, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, many "expeditionary teams" were organized and sent to areas with fewer people and more land. The "expeditionary teams" of the Henan Military Region traveled hundreds of miles day and night to places like Xuchang and Xiping, erected tents, and worked with the farmers day and night to carry out rush harvesting and planting. The "expeditionary teams" of the Hubei Military Region that went to the Echeng area also carried forward the "Old Eighth Route Army" style, living, eating, and working with the farmers.

In the face of the golden fields and abundant harvest everywhere, the soldiers demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. More than 4,300 officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in the Nanjing area reaped more than 117,400 mu of wheat from June 4th to 9th. The labor achievements of many units surpassed those of the agricultural cooperatives' youth shock brigades, and some white-haired old generals became "wheat-cutting pacesetters," leading their units to win the "Outstanding" red flag. During the wheat harvest, the weather changed drastically, and under the bold slogans such as "Speed up support and ensure a bumper harvest," "Seize grain from the sky," and "Fight the wind and rain for a bumper harvest," officers and soldiers rushed to harvest in the wind and rain. After working for a day, a certain PLA company stationed in Henan heard a heavy rain warning and immediately put down their rice bowls and worked through the night in the rain, rush-harvesting more than 60 mu of wheat. Troops guarding Dongtou Island in the southeast coast rushed to harvest all the wheat of the local agricultural cooperative in a stormy night, saving it from disaster. The officers and soldiers ensured "three quicks" (quick harvesting, quick transportation, quick threshing) and "four cleans" (clean cutting, clean gleaning, clean threshing, clean winnowing) in the areas where they harvested. Some units organized "inspection teams" to ensure that every grain was returned home. The troops stationed in Chengdu not only generally achieved clean cutting and clean threshing, but many units also achieved clean gleaning, weighing, and sending into warehouses.

The troops participating in the summer harvest and planting were generally welcomed and praised by the people. Wherever they went, people came to express their appreciation with baskets and jars of gifts. A quick-rhyme circulating in the Caitang Cooperative of Anhui Province praised the People's Liberation Army: When the cooperative members see the PLA, everyone smiles and expresses their heartfelt feelings. You planted the wheat last year, and this year you help with the harvest. With a good harvest and full granaries, the army brings a beautiful scene. Let's make an oily pancake to celebrate the harvest, and send it to the comrades to taste first. (Attached photo)

    帮助农民苦干了一冬大干了一春
    解放军又全力投入夏收夏种
    新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军北方驻军，目前正以一日千万亩的进度，帮助农业社抢收小麦；驻南方地区的部队在夏收报捷之后，又投入夏种。这是人民解放军帮助农民苦干一冬，大干一春以后，又一个全力支援农业生产的新高潮。
    今年各部队助民夏收，比往年声势大，干劲足，成绩高。麦收前，各部队作了充分准备，打镰刀，买农具，准备车辆马匹。小麦成熟期一到，各部队都停止操课，由指挥员亲自挂帅，人畜车辆全部出动。有的部队还组织了指挥所，统一指挥这次大规模的夏收活动。过去，各部队都是“就地支援”，今年在当地党委统一领导下，组织了许多“远征队”，开往人少地多的地区。河南军区的“远征队”，日夜兼程数百里，到了许昌、西平等地，架起帐蓬，和农民一起昼夜突击，抢收抢种。湖北军区开往鄂城地区的“远征队”，还发扬了“老八路”作风，和农民同住同吃同劳动。
    战士们在千里金黄，遍地麦香的大丰收面前，发挥了冲天干劲。驻南京地区某部四千三百多名官兵，从6月4日到9日，割麦十一万七千四百多亩。许多部队的劳动成绩赛过了农业社的青年突击队，有些白发苍苍的老将军当了“割麦标兵”，领导部队夺得“优胜”红旗。麦收期间，天气急剧变化，部队官兵在“加紧支援，确保丰收”、“和老天争粮”、“同风雨夺丰收”等豪言壮语下，纷纷冒风雨抢收。河南驻军某连，劳动一天之后，听到大雨警报，立即放下饭碗，冒雨干了一个通宵，抢割小麦六十多亩。守卫在东南沿海洞头岛的部队在暴风雨的夜里，把驻地农业社的小麦全部抢收回家，使其免受灾害。官兵们收割的地方，都作到了“三快”（快收、快运、快打）、“四净”（割净、拾净、打净、扬净）。有的部队组织了“检查组”，保证颗粒还家。驻成都部队不仅普遍作到割净、打光，不少单位还作到捡净、过秤、送入仓库。
    参加夏收夏种的部队。普遍受到人民的欢迎和赞扬。他们所到之处，人民都是提篮携罐前来慰问。安徽省蔡塘社流传一段盛赞解放军的快板：社员见了解放军，人人笑颜述衷心。去年小麦你们种，今年割麦你帮忙。收成好来粮满仓，军队带来好风光。烙个油饼庆丰收，先送同志尝一尝。（附图片）
