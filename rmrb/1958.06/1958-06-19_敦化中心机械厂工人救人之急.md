    Workers of Dunhua Central Machinery Factory Help in Emergency
    On May 1st, when our locomotive entered the Dunhua Station Locomotive Depot for repairs, we discovered that the oil pipe of the automatic lubricator was cracked. The Dunhua Locomotive Depot didn't have welding equipment, and it would have to be taken to Jilin for repair. But we had to leave soon, and there was no time.
    Just as we were anxious, we suddenly saw the Dunhua Central Machinery Factory's team marching past the station in the May Day celebration parade. So we thought we'd take it to the factory to try our luck. The whole factory was on holiday that day, but when we explained our purpose, Party Branch Secretary Liu readily agreed to help us repair it, and immediately sent someone to find comrades Li Zhaoqin and Wang Jinyou, who had just finished their shifts and hadn't yet rested. Thanks to their efforts, the oil pipe was welded in just twenty minutes.
    Thanks to the workers of the Dunhua Central Machinery Factory who were able to sacrifice their rest time to help us repair the oil pipe, we were able to leave on time. All the comrades in our crew are very grateful for their help.

    敦化中心机械厂工人救人之急
    5月1日，当我们的机车进入敦化车站机务段进行检修时，发现自动给油器的油管裂了。敦化机务段没有电焊设备，要拿到吉林去修理。可是马上就要开车，时间来不及。
    正当我们着急的时候，忽然在庆祝“五一”节游行队伍中看见敦化中心机械厂的队伍从车站前面走过，于是我们就想拿到这个工厂去试试看。这一天全厂都休假了，可是当我们说明来意后，党总支刘书记满口答应一定帮我们修好，并立刻派人去把刚下了班还没有休息的工人李照琴和王进有两位同志找来。在他们的努力下，仅用了二十分钟就把给油管焊好了。
    由于敦化中心机械厂工人同志们能牺牲休息时间，协助我们修好了油管，我们才能准时开车，我们包乘组的全体同志非常感谢他们的帮助。
