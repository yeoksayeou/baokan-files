Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky
Peking University Student Factory Successfully Trial-Produces New Products

The newly established semiconductor factory of the fourth-year students of the Physics Department of Peking University has successfully trial-produced products such as selenium photocells ahead of schedule.

On June 10th, Peking University put forward the leap forward plan of "Working hard for five years to build an advanced communist new Peking University." The students were very excited when they learned about it, and the fourth-year students of the Physics Department decided to set up a semiconductor factory.

Most of the students in this department support the establishment of a factory, believing that this can well implement the policy of combining education with politics and education with labor production. However, some people doubted it. They said, "Chicken feathers can't fly to the sky," "Young lads can't do big things," and "What if it closes down after a while?" They also said, "This is just an emotional impulse, a petty-bourgeois frenzy, and it may not work." After two days of great debate, the students' thinking was basically unified. They realized that this is the path of transforming their thinking in a more, faster, better, and more economical way; it is the path of accelerating the training of working-class intellectuals. The teachers of the Semiconductor Teaching and Research Section also held three or four meetings to study the issue of "running a factory," and they wanted to work with the students.

When the factory started, it encountered the problem of funding. Some students advocated selling watches and clothes to raise funds. Some proposed relying on their own hands and labor to raise funds. After debate, the students realized that the purpose of running a factory is to train themselves to be communist laborers, and the funding problem should also be solved through labor.

Lu Ping, the first secretary of the Party committee, learned about this, came to see everyone in person, and said, "The Party supports you, you must persevere and promote it!"

They decided to start production using the existing instruments and equipment first, and to go to nearby construction sites of the Academy of Sciences and milk factories in their spare time to earn money.

Many units outside the school also took the initiative to come to help them after hearing the news. Comrades from the Electrical Science Research Institute explained the production of generators to everyone, and comrades from the Physics Institute introduced the crystal production process and experience to everyone. The Nonferrous Metals Bureau helped the factory overcome difficulties in materials.

Many difficulties were encountered in the trial production process. For example, when they started trial-producing selenium photocells, some people opposed it. They said, "The gentlemen have failed several times in the past, we have no experience, how can we make it?" Some watched and doubted. After discussion, it was finally decided to do it. Afterwards, they encountered a series of technical difficulties, which they all tried to overcome.

The students were full of energy, working day and night. The teachers also helped out, often staying up late.

They started production in the afternoon of the 15th, originally planning to produce the first batch of selenium photocells on July 1st, but everyone worked harder, and they successfully trial-produced them in less than three days. The quality exceeded that of the British goods used in the school laboratory.

The students were in high spirits. They decided to produce in large quantities. They said, "This is the direction of communism. This way, teaching, scientific research and production are combined."

    鸡毛飞上了天
    北大学生工厂试制新产品成功
    北京大学物理系四年级学生新成立的半导体工厂，提前试制成功硒光电池等产品。
    6月10日北大提出“苦战五年，建成先进的共产主义新北大”的跃进规划，同学们知道了很兴奋，物理系四年级学生决定筹建半导体工厂。
    这个系的大部分同学都拥护办工厂，认为这样可以很好地贯彻教育与政治、教育与劳动生产相结合的方针。但也有人怀疑，他们说：“鸡毛飞不上天”，“毛头小伙子干不出大事来”，“过一段时间关了门怎么办”？又说：“这只是情绪冲动，是小资产阶级的狂热病，不一定行。”经过两天大争大辩，同学们的思想基本上统一了。认识到这是改造思想的多、快、好、省的道路；是加速培养工人阶级知识分子的道路。半导体教研室的教师也开了三、四次会研究“办工厂”的问题，他们要和同学们一起劳动。
    办厂开始，就碰到了资金问题。有的同学主张卖手表、卖衣服来筹集资金。有的提出靠自己的双手、靠劳动来筹资金。经过辩论，同学们认识到：办工厂的目的是为了把自己培养成共产主义的劳动者，资金问题，也应该用劳动来解决。
    党委第一书记陆平知道了，亲自来找大家，并说：“党支持你们，你们要把它坚持下去，推广下去！”
    他们决定利用现有的仪器设备先开始生产，有空就去附近的科学院工地和牛奶厂劳动筹集资金。
    校外许多单位听到这个消息后，也主动跑来帮他们。电气科学研究院的同志们给大家讲解发电机的生产情况，物理研究所的同志把晶体生产过程和经验介绍给大家。有色金属局帮助工厂克服材料上的困难。
    在试制过程中遇到不少困难。比如，开始试制硒光电池时，有人反对，他们说：“先生们过去做过几次都失败了，咱们没经验，怎能制成功？”有的观望、怀疑。经过讨论，最后决定还是做。以后又碰到一连串技术上的困难，他们都想法克服了。
    同学们干劲十足，连夜干。先生们也帮着做，常常熬到深夜。
    他们15日午后开始生产，原打算7月1日制出头一批硒光电池，那知道，大家一加劲，不到三天就试制成功了。质量超过校内实验室用的英国货。
    同学们情绪很高，他们决定大批生产，他们说：“这是共产主义的方向。这样作，把教学、科学研究和生产结合起来了。”
