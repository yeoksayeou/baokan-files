Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- "Heroes on the battlefield, good men in construction," demobilized soldiers across the country are throwing themselves into the torrent of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production with a fighting spirit.

    Demobilized soldiers fighting on the agricultural production front are taking the lead and playing a significant role in production. In Jixian County's Chengguan Town, Hebei Province, 132 demobilized soldiers actively participated in the fight against drought, digging 135 earth and stone wells in a single day and night. In Hequ County, Shanxi Province, over 1,000 demobilized soldiers had 91.5% of them become activists or were rated as models during the Great Leap Forward, receiving praise and rewards from the local Party and government. In many places, demobilized soldiers formed production shock brigades and fighting teams, undertaking the most arduous tasks in agricultural production. When the people of Funing County, Hebei Province, were building water conservancy projects and needed to tunnel through a mountain ridge, the county Party committee's plan called for seven days to complete the task, but a pioneer company composed of demobilized soldiers tunneled through the mountain ridge in a single day and night. The Yufeng Cooperative in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, originally planned to spend 251 days building a four-li long, one-meter wide irrigation canal, but a demobilized soldiers' shock brigade completed it in only 100 days. The Guanghua County Party Committee attaches great importance to the shock role of demobilized soldiers, and currently, the county has over 700 production shock brigades composed of over 2,400 demobilized soldiers as the backbone, ensuring that every cooperative has a shock brigade and every brigade has a shock team, forming a mighty production shock force. Many demobilized soldiers on the industrial production front have also made personal Great Leap Forward plans and launched competitions. After launching competitions, demobilized soldiers in Baotou City have continuously achieved new successes. Demobilized soldiers in the crane team of the Baotou Metal Structure Company boldly innovated technology and improved construction methods, installing an open-air station bridge, increasing the workload from an average of 30 tons per day to 404.8 tons, increasing work efficiency by 13 times. In a machinery factory in Shenyang City, demobilized and transferred soldiers have launched a competition movement since March of this year, comparing progressiveness, drive, action, and results between individuals and collectives, achieving great results. For example, Qin Congxian, a demobilized soldier in the tool workshop, worked hard for 12 days in the competition, completing the plan to improve the live-type machine for machine tool accessories four and a half months ahead of schedule. Wang Shun, a demobilized soldier in the 18th workshop, put forward two rationalization proposals in the competition, saving the country 6,300 yuan.

    Many demobilized soldiers have demonstrated creativity in the technical innovation movement. According to incomplete statistics from 26 counties and cities in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places, demobilized soldiers have invented and created more than 100 new types of tools, machinery, and scientific instruments, some of which have reached a relatively high level. Fifteen demobilized soldiers in the third workshop of the Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced ten water pumps in three days. Li Zheng-biao, a demobilized soldier at the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, and his comrades worked hard day and night to produce "vacuum baked grease" and "vacuum sealing compound," the quality of which has reached a very high level. Li Bingbi, a demobilized soldier from Nan Cheng Township, Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, has never attended school, but he has diligently studied and successively modified and created five types of waterwheels. A small power station designed and installed by him this spring has now been put into production. In the technical innovation movement, many demobilized soldiers have been praised as "courageous, intelligent, and resourceful," becoming figures who "surpass Lu Ban" and "make the sea dragon angry." According to statistics from Huguan County, Shanxi Province, there are 786 demobilized soldiers who are publicly recognized by the masses as "all-rounders," "local experts," and skilled technicians.

    在战场上是英雄　在建设中是好汉
    复员军人在大跃进中一马当先
    新华社11日讯　“在战场上是英雄，在建设中是好汉”，各地复员军人纷纷以战斗姿态投入工农业生产大跃进的洪流中。
    战斗在农业生产战线上的复员军人，一马当先，在生产中发挥了很大的作用。河北省蓟县城关镇的一百三十二名复员军人，积极参加抗旱斗争，曾在一昼夜之间打了土井、石井一百三十五眼。山西省河曲县一千多名复员军人，在大跃进中有91.5％成为积极分子或被评为模范，受到当地党和政府的表扬和奖励。许多地方的复员军人组成生产突击队、战斗队等，担负起农业生产中的最艰巨的任务。河北省抚宁县人民在修水利时要凿通一座山岭，中共县委提出的计划是七天凿通，但由复员军人组成的尖兵连一昼夜就把这座山岭凿通了。湖北省光化县裕丰社，原计划用二百五十一天的时间修建一条四里长、一公尺宽的灌溉渠，而复员军人突击队只用了一百天的时间就完成了。中共光化县委很重视复员军人的突击作用，目前全县有以二千四百多名复员军人为骨干组成的七百多个生产突击队，做到社社有突击队，队队有突击组，形成一支声势浩大的生产突击队伍。工业生产战线上的许多复员军人，在生产大跃进中也都订了个人跃进规划，展开了竞赛。包头市的复员军人在展开竞赛以后，不断创造出新的成绩。包头金属结构公司吊车小组的复员军人，大胆革新技术，改进施工方法，安装了露天站桥，工作量由每日平均吊三十吨提高到四百零四点八吨，提高工作效率十三倍。在沈阳市一个机械工厂里工作的复员、转业军人，自今年3月份以来，展开了个人与个人、集体与集体之间的比先进、比干劲、比行动、比战果的竞赛运动，获得了很大成绩。如工具车间复员军人秦从先在竞赛中苦干了十二天，提前四个半月完成了改进机床附件活型机的计划。十八车间复员军人王顺在竞赛中提出了两项合理化建议，为国家节约了六千三百元。
    许多复员军人在技术革新运动中发挥了创造性。据浙江、江苏、江西、辽宁、山西、内蒙古、贵州、陕西、甘肃等地二十六个县市的不完全统计，复员军人发明创造的新式工具、机械和科学仪器等约有一百多件，其中有的已经达到较高的水平。南京市水工仪器厂第三车间的十五名复员军人，以三天的时间试制成功了十架抽水泵。北京电子管厂复员军人李正标和他的战友们苦干两昼夜，制成“真空烤克脂”和“真空密封膏”，质量已达到很高的水平。山西省潞安县南呈乡复员军人李炳璧没有进过学校，但是他刻苦钻研，先后改制和创造了五种水车。今春经他亲手设计和安装的一座小型发电站，现在已经投入生产了。在技术革新运动中，有许多复员军人被誉为“有勇、有智、办法高明”，成为“赛过鲁班”、“气死蛟龙”的人物。据山西省壶关县统计，被群众公认为“万宝全”、“土专家”和技术能手的复员军人就有七百八十六人。
