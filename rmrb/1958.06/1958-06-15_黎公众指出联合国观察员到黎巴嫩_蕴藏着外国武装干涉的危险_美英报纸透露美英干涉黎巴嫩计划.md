Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, dispatch from Beirut, June 13th, TASS: The Lebanese public is deeply concerned about the Security Council's dispatch of a United Nations observer group to Lebanon.

The well-known political figure and former Lebanese Prime Minister, Yafi, said that the Security Council's resolution contains dangerous consequences, because what may follow it is foreign troops, which would be a threat to Lebanese independence.

According to the "Daily News," Lebanese Speaker of Parliament, Oseiran, expressed concern that sending foreign observers to Lebanon is "completely preparing for foreign armed intervention."

The Lebanese National United Front and other parties and groups also agreed with this view. The National United Front stated in a statement that the intervention of Western countries and Baghdad Pact member states in Lebanese internal affairs is a serious danger to Lebanon, and it is the United States, Britain, France, Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan that are sending weapons and equipment to Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, dispatch from New York, June 13th, TASS: "New York Post" reporter Alan reported from Washington that US President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan, in their just-concluded talks, reached an agreement on the conditions under which they would conduct military intervention in Lebanon. The reporter pointed out that a formal request from Lebanese President Chamoun would be a primary condition for such intervention.

The reporter emphasized that "President Eisenhower and Macmillan decided to emulate the precedent of Korea and carry out armed intervention in Lebanon."

In addition, TASS, London, June 13th: The British "News Chronicle" published a commentary by the newspaper's commentator, Willis, on the front page with large headlines, revealing that Britain and the United States have already formulated plans for armed intervention in Lebanon. Willis wrote that these plans were formulated three weeks ago and have been approved by the British and American governments. If the situation in Lebanon does not develop in the direction they hope in the near future, these plans will soon be implemented.

According to the armed intervention plan, the US Sixth Fleet will transport 3,000 Marines to land in Beirut; British and American paratroop units will occupy southern Lebanon. Willis said that the British strategic reserve force on the island of Cyprus would be incorporated into this airborne force.

    黎公众指出联合国观察员到黎巴嫩
    蕴藏着外国武装干涉的危险
    美英报纸透露美英干涉黎巴嫩计划
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特13日讯：黎巴嫩公众对安理会派遣联合国观察员小组到黎巴嫩一事深表不安。
    著名的政界人士、黎巴嫩前总理雅非说，安理会的决议蕴藏着危险的后果，因为跟随它而来的可能是外国军队，这将是对黎巴嫩独立的威胁。
    据“日报”报道说，黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰表示耽心，派遣外国观察员到黎巴嫩“完全是为外国武装干涉作准备”。
    黎巴嫩民族统一阵线和其它各政党、团体的会议也都同意这种看法。民族统一阵线在声明中指出，西方国家和巴格达条约成员国干涉黎巴嫩内政是对黎巴嫩的一个严重危险，正是美国、英国、法国、土耳其、伊拉克和约旦把武器和装备送到黎巴嫩。
    据新华社14日讯　塔斯社纽约13日讯：“纽约邮报”记者艾伦自华盛顿报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦在刚刚结束的会谈中，就他们对黎巴嫩进行军事干涉将要根据的条件达成了协议。记者指出，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的正式请求将是这种干涉的一个首要的条件。
    这个记者着重指出，“艾森豪威尔总统和麦克米伦决定效仿朝鲜的前例，对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。”
    另据塔斯社伦敦13日讯：英国“新闻纪事报”在第一版以大字标题刊登了该报评论员韦利斯的评论文章，透露英美两国已经制定好了武装干涉黎巴嫩的计划。韦利斯写道，这些计划是在三个星期以前制定的，并且已经由英美两国政府通过。如果黎巴嫩的局势在最近不向它们所希望的方向发展，这些计划即将付诸实施。
    根据武装干涉计划，美国第六舰队将运送三千名海军陆战队在贝鲁特登陆；美英两国的伞兵部队将占领黎巴嫩的南部。韦利斯说，塞浦路斯岛的英国战略后备军将编入这个空降部队。
