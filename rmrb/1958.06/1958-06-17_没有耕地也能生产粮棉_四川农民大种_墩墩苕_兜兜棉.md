    Producing Grain and Cotton Without Cultivated Land
    Sichuan Farmers Mass Plant "Mound Sweet Potatoes" and "Basket Cotton"
    (Our dispatch) Farmers in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, are making a concerted effort to plant "mound sweet potatoes." It is estimated that the increased grain production from planting "mound sweet potatoes" will be more than 1.25 billion jin, almost equivalent to one-third of the prefecture's total grain output last year.
    Entering the territory of Neijiang Prefecture, one immediately sees a moving scene: on barren mountains and rocky slopes, on both sides of roads, even under the eaves of houses, beside drying grounds, and around courtyards—places where crops are not normally planted or cannot grow at all—"mound sweet potatoes" are planted (sweet potatoes planted on mounds made of pond mud or fertile soil, hence the name "mound sweet potatoes"). Hundreds of "sweet potato roads" and thousands of "sweet potato mountains" have sprung up throughout the prefecture. These mountains often have signs that read "Youth Sweet Potato Mountain," "Women's Sweet Potato Mountain," "Children's Sweet Potato Mountain," "Elderly Sweet Potato Mountain," and so on. Many towns, government offices, and schools have newly built tens of thousands of flower beds and pots, also planted with sweet potatoes. People here say that the entire Neijiang Prefecture has been greened with sweet potatoes.
    Neijiang Prefecture has approximately five million mu of barren mountains and gaps. The greatest advantage of "mound sweet potatoes" is that they can utilize these lands and yield immediate results without requiring much labor, investment, or time.
    "Mound sweet potatoes" were created through the joint research of the Rong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and local farmers, based on the experience of planting pile sweet potatoes. In mid-May, when the production inspection team organized by the Neijiang Prefectural Party Committee came to the county to inspect production, they discovered this innovation and immediately promoted it throughout the prefecture, putting forward the slogan of "not wasting an inch of land, seizing every opportunity to plant." The masses throughout the prefecture immediately began to plant "mound sweet potatoes" on all barren land and gaps. The plans formulated by various counties have been repeatedly exceeded. The initial plan for the entire prefecture was 300,000 mu, then 1 million mu, and now a new target of 2.7 million mu has been proposed. Farmers everywhere are full of confidence and guarantee to complete the task. This experience of Neijiang Prefecture has been promoted throughout Sichuan Province. (Liu Chongtang)
    (Our dispatch) Inspired and driven by the "mound sweet potato" planting in Neijiang Prefecture, farmers in various parts of Sichuan Province have recently come up with many good ways to increase grain and cotton planting without occupying cultivated land during the summer planting season. Members of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Pengshan County have created "basket cotton." The method involves weaving bamboo into bamboo cages one foot high, filling the cages with fertile soil, leveling and smoothing it, and then transplanting cotton seedlings into them, planting three or four seedlings per basket, applying fertilizer and water, and placing them in courtyards or other open spaces. It is estimated that each basket can produce about two liang of cotton. The whole county is now promoting this experience and has launched a campaign to plant 20 "basket cotton" per household, planning to increase cotton production by 150,000 jin, equivalent to one-third of the county's total cotton production last year. Farmers of the Yujiang Second Cooperative in Zhongjiang County are also using broken baskets, back baskets, bamboo baskets, etc., filling them with soil, to plant corn. The cooperative members call it "bamboo basket corn," which not only does not occupy cultivated land but can also be moved. More than 100 households in the cooperative have planted 200 plants each, which can increase corn production by more than 9,000 jin. This year, due to the expansion of other crops, the corn planting area in the cooperative has decreased. However, since the "bamboo basket corn" method was devised, corn production will still increase compared to last year. Farmers in Liuhe Township, Rongjing County, feeling that the ground is not enough because the increased production area has reached a considerable level, have recently begun to develop in the air while striving to increase the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land. They have created "aerial sweet potatoes" and "aerial corn." The method is to plant sweet potatoes and corn in bamboo cages, hang them on trees, walls, and houses, or use bamboo to build racks and place them over streams. The whole township has increased planting by tens of thousands of nests of sweet potatoes and corn using this method.

### 没有耕地也能生产粮棉  四川农民大种“墩墩苕”“兜兜棉”

    没有耕地也能生产粮棉
    四川农民大种“墩墩苕”“兜兜棉”
    本报讯　四川省内江专区农民正突击种植“墩墩苕”。据估计，种“墩墩苕”增产的粮食十二亿五千多万斤，几乎相当于全专区去年粮食总产量的三分之一。
    走进内江专区境内，立即就会看到一幅动人的景象：在荒山石坡上、道路的两侧、甚至在屋檐下、晒坝旁以及院子周围这些不种庄稼或根本不生长庄稼的地方，都栽种着“墩墩苕”（用塘泥或肥泥堆成一墩，在上面种红苕，所以称“墩墩苕”）。全区涌现了数百条“红苕路”，上千座“红苕山”。在这些山头上常常插有牌子，写着“青年红苕山”、“妇女红苕山”、“儿童红苕山”、“老年红苕山”等字样。许多城镇、机关、学校新筑起了数以万计的花台、花盆，里面种的也是红苕。这里的人说，内江全区已被红苕绿化。
    内江专区约有五百万亩荒山隙地，“墩墩苕”的最大作用就在于它能利用这些土地，不需要花费多大劳力、投资和时间，就能即刻收效。
    “墩墩苕”是中共荣县县委总结了当地种堆堆苕的经验和农民共同研究创造的。5月中，中共内江地委组织的生产检查团到该县检查生产时，发现了这个创造，便立即在全区推广，并提出了“不荒一寸土、见缝就插针”的行动口号，全区群众立即在一切荒土隙地上抢种“墩墩苕”。各县制定的计划，一再被突破。全区第一次提出的三十万亩，第二次提出一百万亩，现在又提出二百七十万亩的新指标。各地农民信心百倍，保证完成。内江专区这个经验，已在四川全省推广。　（刘崇棠）
    本报讯　四川省各地农民在内江专区种“墩墩苕”的启发带动下，最近在夏种中想出了许多不占耕地增种粮棉的好办法。彭山县先锋农业社社员创造了一种“兜兜棉”，作法是用竹子编成一尺高大的竹笼，在笼内装上肥土，铺平整细后，把棉苗移栽进去，每兜栽植三、四株，施了肥水，放在院坝或其他空处，估计每兜能产棉花二两上下。现在全县正在推广这个经验，发起每户种二十个“兜兜棉”的增种运动，计划多增产棉花十五万斤，等于去年该县棉花总产量的三分之一。中江县玉江二社农民还利用破旧的箩筐、背兜、篾篓等，装上泥土，种植玉米。社员称它为“竹箩玉米”，不仅不占耕地，而且可以移动。全社一百多户农民，每户种了二百株，可增产玉米九千多斤。今年该社因扩大了其他作物，玉米播种面积减少，自从想出了“竹箩玉米”的办法后，玉米还将比去年增产。滎经县六合乡农民，因增产面积已达到相当程度，感到地面不够使用，最近在努力提高现有耕地的单位产量同时，开始向空中发展，他们创造了一种“空中红苕”、“空中玉米”。作法是把竹笼里面种上红苕、玉米，吊在树上、墙上、房上，或用竹子搭成架子放在溪沟上。全乡用这种办法增种了好几万窝红苕和玉米。
