Blatant Colonialist Policy
By our commentator

    In a series of speeches delivered in Algeria, de Gaulle announced the main points of his Algerian policy: Algeria "will always be French territory"; to make the Algerian people "full" French citizens.
    What a blatant colonialist policy! To put it more bluntly, it is to completely annex Algeria.
    De Gaulle attempts to conceal the essence of this colonialist policy with some fine-sounding words. He says that the purpose of doing this is to establish equal and friendly relations between the European residents and Muslim residents in Algeria.
    Obviously, this trick cannot fool anyone. Since the right of the Algerian people to national independence is denied, what equality can be spoken of? Since the French colonial army is still carrying out bloody massacres of the Algerian people, what friendship can be spoken of?
    The leadership of the Algerian National Liberation Front has issued a communique, solemnly condemning de Gaulle's colonialist policy. The communique points out that de Gaulle's policy has closed the door to a negotiated settlement of the Algerian question on the basis of recognizing Algerian independence. Therefore, he should bear full responsibility for the continuation of the war and the possible expansion of the war to the entire North Africa.
    In fact, de Gaulle is preparing to continue the Algerian war. He vigorously praised the French colonial army's suppression of the Algerian national independence movement, calling it a "magnificent work." He also told the officers of the colonial army that he "will rely on them" now and in the future.
    But what is the result of doing so? The answer can only be one: the result will be to put France in even more serious difficulties than in the past.
    Military suppression can never subdue the Algerian people, and the facts of the past three and a half years have fully demonstrated this. Now, the strength of the Algerian people is much stronger than in the past, and the unity of the North African people has been further strengthened. There is no doubt that France's continued colonial war will only put it in a more unfavorable position on the battlefield.
    The heavy military expenditure of the Algerian war has brought French finances to the brink of bankruptcy. Binet, de Gaulle's finance minister, felt troubled about raising military funds as soon as he took office. If the colonial war cannot be ended, France's financial situation will inevitably deteriorate further.
    In order to tide over the financial difficulties, France has to seek assistance from the United States. It is reported that the de Gaulle government has requested the United States to postpone the repayment of debts to France. Everyone knows that the bosses in Washington never do business at a loss. The US dollar will not only open the way for the United States to further infiltrate North Africa, but will also put the de Gaulle government in a position of wagging its tail and begging, like the previous French governments.
    In short, the Algerian war is a root of trouble for France. Several of de Gaulle's predecessors were overwhelmed by this problem and stepped down in a mess. Since de Gaulle ignores the lessons of the past and insists on a colonial policy on the Algerian issue, he will inevitably repeat the mistakes of his predecessors.

　　露骨的殖民主义政策
　　本报评论员
    戴高乐在阿尔及利亚连续发表的几次演说里宣布了他的阿尔及利亚政策的要点：阿尔及利亚“永远是法国的领土”；使阿尔及利亚人民成为“十足的”法籍公民。
    多么露骨的殖民主义政策啊！说得再干脆一点，那就是：彻底并吞阿尔及利亚。
    戴高乐企图用一些动听的词句把这种殖民主义政策的实质掩盖起来。他说，他这样做的目的，是要在阿尔及利亚的欧洲籍居民和穆斯林居民之间建立平等和友爱的关系。
    显然，要这种手法是骗不过任何人的。既然拒绝阿尔及利亚人民得到民族独立的权利，那还谈得上什么平等呢？既然法国殖民军队还在对阿尔及利亚人民进行血腥的屠杀，那还谈得上什么友爱呢？
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导机构已经发表公报，严正地谴责戴高乐的殖民主义政策。公报指出：戴高乐的政策，已经关上了在承认阿尔及利亚独立的基础上谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题的大门。因此，他就应该对继续进行战争和战争可能扩大到整个北非负完全责任。
    事实上，戴高乐正是准备把阿尔及利亚战争继续下去的。他竭力赞扬法国殖民军队对阿尔及利亚民族独立运动的武力镇压，说这是一件“宏伟的工作”。他还对殖民军队的军官们说，他在现在和将来“都将依仗他们”。
    但是，这样做的结果是什么呢？回答只能是一个：结果将使法国陷入比过去更加严重的困难中。
    军事镇压绝不能使阿尔及利亚人民屈服，三年半的事实已经充分证明了这一点。现在，阿尔及利亚人民的力量已经比过去强大得多了，北非人民的团结也进一步加强了。毫无疑问，法国把殖民战争继续下去，只会在战场上处于更不利的地位。
    阿尔及利亚战争沉重的军费，已经使法国财政面临破产的边缘。戴高乐的财政部长比内一上台，就为筹措军费感到为难。殖民战争不能结束，法国的财政状况势必将更加恶化。
    为了度过财政难关，法国就不得不向美国求援。有消息说，戴高乐政府已经要求美国延期向法国收回债款。谁都知道，华盛顿的老板是从来不做亏本生意的。美元不仅将为美国进一步渗入北非打开道路，而且将使戴高乐政府处于摇尾乞怜的地位，像过去的法国政府一样。
    总之，阿尔及利亚战争是法国的一条祸根。戴高乐的几个前任，都在这个问题上弄得焦头烂额而狼狈下台。既然戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上不顾前车之鉴而坚持殖民政策，他就必然会重蹈他前任的复辙。
