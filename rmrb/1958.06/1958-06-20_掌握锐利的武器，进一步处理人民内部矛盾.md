Grasp Sharp Weapons and Further Handle Contradictions Among the People
Sha Ying

A year has passed since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The development of the situation in our country over the past year has fully demonstrated its epoch-making significance.

The emergence of Comrade Mao Zedong's work was not sudden. After the high tide of socialist transformation of the three major industries in early 1957, the socialist ownership of the means of production was basically established, and the socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory on the economic front. This was a turning point in the history of our country. In order to carry out a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, in order to continue to consolidate and develop our socialist ownership and the dictatorship of the proletariat, in order to avoid serious errors in construction and to master the laws of construction as soon as possible, how to distinguish between the two types of contradictions—those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people—and how to handle contradictions among the people in order to mobilize all positive factors and unite the strength of all ethnic groups in the country to engage in socialist construction, became a particularly important and urgent issue. Under these circumstances, Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound theoretical analysis of the new problems raised in revolutionary practice and gave correct answers in a timely manner. If we trace it back further, Comrade Mao Zedong's report on "The Ten Major Relationships" at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party in April 1956 mainly explained various issues around the viewpoint of correctly handling contradictions among the people. The work report of the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party was based on the principles and policies of Comrade Mao Zedong on handling the ten major relationships. Comrade Mao Zedong's work on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is a continuation and development of the above viewpoints and is published in a more complete form.

In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong first made a very thorough analysis of the two types of contradictions with different natures and the issue of using different methods to deal with contradictions of different natures; then, he gave principled instructions on the major issues of our country at the time, such as the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the issue of agricultural cooperation, the issue of transforming industry and commerce, the issue of intellectuals, the issue of minority nationalities, etc. Here, he focused on discussing the issue of contradictions among the people.

As everyone knows, many people used to deny that there were contradictions in socialist society. They shrank back from social contradictions, were in a passive position, and could not take correct methods to deal with contradictions, which would hinder rather than promote the development of society. Naturally, there was no talk of the development of theory. Even some people who admitted that there were contradictions in socialist society could not distinguish between the two types of contradictions and often confused them, which would cause great harm to revolutionary practice. Because: If contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are treated as contradictions among the people, right-leaning opportunist errors will be committed, and even the mire of revisionism will be fallen into; if contradictions among the people are treated as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, "left"-leaning opportunist and dogmatist errors will be committed. Because Comrade Mao Zedong systematically solved these problems, liberated people from the shackles of metaphysical viewpoints, enabled them to adhere to the viewpoint of materialist dialectics in thinking about problems, attach importance to contradictions in socialist society, distinguish between the two types of contradictions, find the correct method for handling contradictions among the people, and prompted people to always pay attention to improving the imperfect links in the relations of production and the superstructure, this undoubtedly has great significance for promoting the development of socialist society. In this rectification campaign and anti-rightist struggle, the reason why we were able to correctly handle contradictions between ourselves and the enemy on the one hand, attack, disintegrate, and isolate the enemy, and on the other hand, correctly handle many contradictions among the people, unite ourselves, and mobilize all positive factors, was precisely because the broad masses of cadres mastered Comrade Mao Zedong's sharp weapon for handling contradictions among the people.

The analysis of the main contradictions in our country during the transition period by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is also of great significance. According to this analysis: During the transition period in our country, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads are always the main contradictions in the country. However, this main contradiction is manifested as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy in a small number of areas, and as contradictions among the people in a large number of other areas. Regarding contradictions among the people, some are caused by the existence of classes and the influence of classes, but some are caused by people's subjective understanding not conforming to objective reality. For example, contradictions such as right and wrong, advanced and backward, positive and negative, some of which are related to the influence of classes, but most are the product of erroneous ideological methods. Contradictions caused by cognitive reasons will still exist in the billions of years after classes are eliminated in the future. The law of development of things is always like this, old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions will appear, contradictions are constantly resolved and constantly appear, and there is no end. This will also be the case in the future communist society, which can absolutely not be without contradictions, because without contradictions there will be no development of society. At that time, there will still be good people and bad people, and there will still be people with correct ideas and people with wrong ideas, so there will still be contradictions and struggles between people. It's just that the contradictions at that time are different from the contradictions in class society and do not include class contradictions. There are still some people who cannot understand this point. However, if we look at it not from a metaphysical point of view but from a dialectical point of view, we must come to such a conclusion. At the same time, in our practice, it has also proved this point. For example, some of the subjectivist styles we oppose, as well as some debates about the speed of industrial and agricultural development, etc., cannot be regarded as a reflection of class contradictions. Similar situations will also exist in the future communist society.

Comrade Mao Zedong's views on dividing the two types of contradictions and correctly handling contradictions among the people are based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, combined with China's specific revolutionary practice, and summarized the revolutionary experience of our country over the past few decades and the construction experience of the past few years. At the same time, it absorbed the experience of the international communist movement and made a systematic scientific argument, which enriched and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. There is no doubt that this will have a profound impact on the development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences.

Comrade Mao Zedong's work is a guide to our revolutionary practice, and now it has blossomed and borne fruit. If we recall the actual situation of our country over the past year: the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle have achieved great victories, a new lively political situation has emerged, the relationship between people has greatly changed, "superstitions" have been broken, minds have been liberated, the political awareness and enthusiasm of cadres and the people have been greatly improved, bringing about a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various construction tasks, and rapidly changing the face of our country. All of these have been achieved under the ideological illumination of Comrade Mao Zedong's great work. Because the rectification campaign led by the Party was launched in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's principles on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and the general program of rectification drove the entire work of the Party and the state, forming a national high tide of production and construction. This means that Comrade Mao Zedong's thought has become a powerful material force.

Theory originates from practice, and in turn guides practice, and is tested and developed by practice. Comrade Mao Zedong's views on correctly handling contradictions among the people have not only been tested by revolutionary practice, but have now been enriched and developed by the experience of thousands upon thousands of people. For example: Regarding the issue of using democratic methods to solve contradictions among the people, in this rectification campaign, thousands upon thousands of people used methods such as speaking out freely, airing views fully, holding great debates, putting up big-character posters, and holding discussion meetings to conduct criticism and self-criticism, systematically exposing and correctly handling many problems, greatly increasing our experience in correctly handling contradictions among the people, making new developments in the Party's mass line, and fully demonstrating the broad democratic life under the socialist system. This is revolutionary practice developing Comrade Mao Zedong's views. Regarding the adjustment of relations of production and certain imperfect links in the superstructure, we have also made many major reforms, such as improving the relationship between people in labor and common activities, improving labor organization and labor management, changing the national management system, changing unreasonable rules and regulations, streamlining institutions, transferring cadres to lower levels, improving work methods, and further transforming bourgeois intellectuals, etc. At the same time, we have also gained many new and valuable experiences in these areas, which has also enriched and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's views.

It should be seen that the development of the situation in our country is such that, on the one hand, contradictions between ourselves and the enemy still exist. As long as there is an opportunity, the enemy will still make waves. We must not ignore this, we must not be negligent and lose our vigilance; on the other hand, what exists in large quantities in our country's political life are contradictions among the people, not contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Among the many contradictions among the people, contradictions belonging to the two classes and the two roads will continue to exist for a relatively long period of time in the future, and will fluctuate and move forward in a tortuous manner; but from the general trend, this kind of contradiction is not increasing and becoming more acute, but is gradually weakening, and finally even disappearing. In addition, other contradictions that do not belong to the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, that is, contradictions between working people, contradictions caused by cognitive reasons, will exist for a long time. In particular, contradictions caused by cognitive reasons will still exist even in the future communist society after class contradictions are eliminated. Under this situation, correctly handling contradictions among the people is an important topic for a long time to come, so we must pay full attention to this issue. As for the current conditions, "the Party's current task is to further handle contradictions among the people on the basis of the rectification campaign, systematically improve national work, strengthen the work of Party organizations at all levels, and unswervingly struggle to implement the general line of socialist construction." (Report by Comrade Liu Shaoqi at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China)

Of course, this rectification campaign is a systematic adjustment of relations among the people, and it has already achieved great results, but one rectification campaign cannot solve all contradictions. The idea of solving everything once and for all is incorrect. At the same time, old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions will arise, which still need to be resolved by us. Now, although we have some experience in correctly handling contradictions among the people, it is still far from enough. In the future, we must continue to explore and continue to summarize experience in this area. For some new relationships between people proposed by the further development of productive forces, we must study and deal with them in a timely manner in order to mobilize all positive factors and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. In particular, we must respect the practice of the masses and the creativity of the masses even more, and learn even more humbly; the so-called problem of correctly handling contradictions among the people is the problem of following the mass line that our Party often talks about. Only in this way can we master the methods and art of correctly handling contradictions among the people, give full play to subjective initiative, and give full play to the infinite creativity hidden in the masses.

In order to further handle contradictions among the people, we must continue to seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's work and better master this sharp weapon. Over the past year, all members of Party organizations at all levels, democratic parties, government departments, and people's organizations have universally organized the study of this work, and it should be said that the study results are not bad. For example, all regions and departments have correctly handled the various contradictions they have encountered, attacked the enemy, united themselves, corrected many shortcomings and errors, and various tasks have been greatly improved, which is proof of this. But we should also point out that there are still many comrades who do not sufficiently recognize the great significance of this work, and their study of it is still far from enough. This situation also exists in the academic community, and it is quite serious, but it has only recently improved somewhat. For example, in various places, it has been found that some comrades cannot distinguish between the two types of contradictions and often confuse them, some comrades mistakenly regard the main contradictions in our country during the transition period as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, some comrades in the past period doubted the correctness of the Party's timely proposal to correctly handle contradictions among the people, some comrades still like to use methods of suppression instead of persuasion to deal with contradictions among the people, some comrades have not yet learned to use the set of methods of speaking out freely, airing views fully, holding great debates, and putting up big-character posters, and so on. All of this proves that many people's study of this work is very poor, and their absorption of the experience of the rectification campaign is far from enough. Therefore, continuing to seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's work, deeply understanding its spirit and essence, and learning to apply this sharp ideological weapon, is still a very important matter. Especially now that the rectification campaign has entered the fourth stage, that is, the stage where everyone studies documents, criticizes and reflects, and improves themselves, Comrade Mao Zedong's work is one of the main study documents, and we should study it well.

When studying Comrade Mao Zedong's work and his other works, we should pay special attention to learning his example of applying Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism in practical work, learning his example of combining the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, combining the serious spirit of principle with the lively spirit of originality, learning his example of closely connecting with the masses of the people, bravely fighting for the truth, and having a noble communist style. Comrade Mao Zedong's work is a model of vividly applying materialist dialectics to revolutionary practice, and it is a model of daring to think and speak and being full of originality on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. In addition to the above-mentioned views on two different types of contradictions and applying different methods to deal with contradictions of different natures, such as the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, how to deal with the trouble caused by a few people and turn bad things into good things, the path of China's industrialization must implement the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, etc., are all pointers for our work in all aspects, and these are also the best examples for us to learn and apply Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us long ago that we study Marxism-Leninism in order to find a position, a point of view, and a method from it. We should also study Comrade Mao Zedong's works with this attitude, and we must never study them with a dogmatic attitude. We must be good at applying Comrade Mao Zedong's thought to practical work and applying the materialism and dialectics that Comrade Mao Zedong respected and developed to practical work. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "We should completely liberate ourselves from the shackles of dogmatism and empiricism, so that our thoughts and work can gain lively development. We should respect the practice of the masses and respect the revolutionary nature and creativity of the masses, which is to respect materialism and dialectics." We should follow this spirit and launch a nationwide upsurge in studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works and further promote the communist movement of ideological liberation.

    掌握锐利的武器，进一步处理人民内部矛盾
    沙英
    毛泽东同志“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的著作发表一周年了。一年来我国形势的发展，充分证明了它具有划时代的伟大意义。
    毛泽东同志这个著作的产生不是突如其来的。当1957年初我国社会主义三大改造高潮之后，生产资料的社会主义所有制基本建立起来了，社会主义革命在经济战线上取得了决定性的胜利。这是我国历史上的一个转折点。为了开展一个政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，为了继续巩固和发展我们的社会主义所有制和无产阶级专政，为了避免在建设中犯严重错误而尽快地掌握建设的规律，如何划清敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾这两类矛盾的界线，如何处理人民内部的矛盾，以便调动一切积极因素，团结全国各族人民的力量来从事社会主义建设，便成为一个特别重要和迫切的问题了。在这种情况下面，毛泽东同志对于革命实践中所提出的新问题，加以深刻的理论分析，及时地作出了正确的解答。如果追溯得远一点的话，毛泽东同志于1956年4月在党中央政治局扩大会议上所作的关于“十大关系”的报告，主要地就是围绕着正确处理人民内部矛盾这样一个观点来说明各种问题的。党的第八届全国代表大会第一次会议的工作报告，就是根据毛泽东同志关于处理十大关系的方针政策而提出的。毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的这一著作是上述观点的继续发展而以更加完备的形态发表出来的。
    毛泽东同志在这篇著作中，首先对于两类不同性质的矛盾，和应当用不同的方法处理不同性质的矛盾问题，作了十分透彻的分析；然后，对于肃反问题、农业合作化问题、工商业改造问题、知识分子问题、少数民族问题……等我国当前的重大问题，从理论原则上作了方针性的指示。在这里，他把重点是放在讨论人民内部的矛盾问题。
    大家都知道，从前有许多人不承认社会主义社会中还有矛盾，他们在社会矛盾面前缩手缩脚，处于被动地位，不能采取正确的方法去处理矛盾，这就会阻碍而不能推动社会的发展。自然也谈不到理论的发展。就是有些人虽然承认社会主义社会中有矛盾，但是划不清两类矛盾的界线，常常混淆两类矛盾，这就会给革命实践造成极大的危害。因为：如果把敌我矛盾当作人民内部矛盾处理，那就会犯右倾机会主义的错误，以至陷入修正主义的泥坑；如果把人民内部矛盾当作敌我矛盾处理，那就会犯“左”倾机会主义和教条主义的错误。由于毛泽东同志对这些问题加以系统的解决，把人们从形而上学观点的束缚中解放出来，使他们坚持运用唯物辩证法的观点思考问题，重视社会主义社会中的矛盾，分清了两类矛盾和找到了正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，并促使人们经常注意改善生产关系和上层建筑中那些不完善的环节。这无疑对于推动社会主义社会的发展有极大的意义。在这一次整风运动和反右派斗争中，我们所以能一方面正确地处理了敌我矛盾，打击、分化和孤立了敌人；一方面又正确地处理了许多人民内部矛盾，团结了自己，调动了一切积极因素，正是由于广大干部掌握了毛泽东同志关于处理人民内部矛盾这个锐利的武器的缘故。
    党中央和毛泽东同志对于我国过渡时期的主要矛盾的分析，也具有重大的意义。按照这种分析：在我国的过渡时期，无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，始终是国内的主要矛盾。不过这个主要矛盾在某些范围内少量地表现为敌我矛盾，在其他范围内则大量地表现为人民内部矛盾。在人民内部矛盾方面，一部分是由于阶级的存在和阶级的影响而产生的，但还有一部分是由于人们的主观认识不符合于客观实际而产生的。例如正确和错误、先进和落后、积极和消极这类矛盾，其中有些同阶级的影响有联系，但多数都是错误的思想方法的产物。由于认识上的原因所产生的矛盾，就是在将来阶级消灭以后的亿万年中也还是存在的。事物的发展规律总是这样，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会出现，矛盾不断解决又不断出现，永无完结之日。在将来的共产主义社会也将是这样的，它绝对不能没有矛盾，如果没有矛盾就没有社会的发展。那时候还是有好人和坏人，还是有思想正确和思想错误的人，因而人们之间还是有矛盾，有斗争。只不过那时的矛盾不同于阶级社会中的矛盾、不包括有阶级矛盾罢了。现在还有些人想不通这一点。可是，如果不是按照形而上学的观点而是按照辩证法的观点来看，我们必然要得出这样的结论。同时在我们的实践当中，也证明了这一点。例如，我们所反对的某些主观主义的作风，以及关于工农业发展速度的某些争论，等等，就不能看作是阶级矛盾的反映。类似这样的情况，就是在将来共产主义社会也是存在的。
    毛泽东同志关于划分两类矛盾和正确处理人民内部矛盾的观点是根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，结合中国的具体革命实践，总结了我国几十年来的革命经验和几年来的建设经验，同时吸收了国际共产主义运动的经验而提出的，并对它作了系统的科学的论证，这是丰富了并创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。毫无疑问，这对马克思列宁主义的哲学和社会科学的发展必将发生深远的影响。
    毛泽东同志这一著作是我们革命实践的指南，现在它已开花结果。如果回忆一下一年来我们国家的实际情况：整风运动和反右派斗争获得了伟大的胜利，出现了一个新的生动活泼的政治局面，人与人的关系有了很大的改变，破除了“迷信”，解放了思想，干部和人民群众的政治觉悟和积极性大为提高，带来了工农业生产和各种建设工作的大跃进，迅速地改变着我国的面貌。所有这些，都是在毛泽东同志这部伟大著作的思想照耀下取得的。因为党所领导的整风运动，是按照毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针而展开的，而整风这条总纲带动了党和国家的全部工作，形成了一种全民的生产和建设的高潮。这就是说，毛泽东同志的思想已经变成了强大的物质力量。
    理论产生于实践，反过来又指导实践，并且为实践所检验所发展。毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的观点，不仅已被革命实践所考验，而且现在已用千千万万人的经验把它丰富了和发展了。例如：关于用民主的方法解决人民内部的矛盾问题，在这次整风运动中，千千万万群众用大鸣大放、大争大辩、出大字报、开座谈会等等进行批评与自我批评的方法，系统地暴露了和正确地处理了许许多多的问题，大大地增加了我们正确处理人民内部矛盾的经验，使党的群众路线有了新的发展，并且充分表现了社会主义制度下的广泛的民主生活。这就是革命实践发展了毛泽东同志的观点。关于在调整生产关系、上层建筑某些不完善的环节方面，我们也作了许多重大的改革，例如改进人们在劳动中和共同活动中的相互关系，改善劳动组织和劳动管理，改变国家的管理体制，改变不合理的规章制度，精简机构，干部下放，改进工作方法，进一步改造资产阶级知识分子，等等，同时我们在这些方面也获得了许多新的宝贵的经验，这也是丰富了和发展了毛泽东同志的观点。
    应当看到，我国形势的发展，一方面是敌我矛盾还存在着，只要一有机会，敌人还会兴风作浪，我们不能忽视，不能麻痹大意，丧失警惕；一方面是在我国政治生活中大量存在的是人民内部矛盾而不是敌我矛盾。在人民内部的许多矛盾中，属于两个阶级、两条道路的矛盾，今后还要存在一个较长的时期，而且时有起伏，曲折前进；但是从总的趋势来看，这种矛盾不是越来越多和日趋尖锐，而是逐步地减弱，最后以至消灭。另外，不属于两个阶级、两条道路斗争的其他一些矛盾，即劳动人民之间的矛盾，由于认识原因所产生的矛盾，则将长期存在。特别是由于认识原因所产生的矛盾，就是在将来阶级矛盾消灭以后的共产主义社会中也仍然存在。在这种形势下面，正确处理人民内部矛盾则是今后长时期的重要课题，所以我们要对这个问题给予充分的注意。至于在现在的条件下，“党在目前的任务，就是要在整风运动的基础上，进一步地处理人民内部矛盾，有系统地改进国家工作，加强各级党组织的工作，百折不挠地为贯彻执行社会主义建设的总路线而斗争。”（刘少奇同志在中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的报告）
    固然这次整风运动是一次有系统的调整人民内部关系，而且已经获得了伟大的成果，但是一次整风运动不可能解决所有的矛盾，一劳永逸的想法是不正确的。同时旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾还会产生，还需要我们加以解决。现在，我们关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的经验虽然已经有了一些，但还是很不够的，今后我们要继续探索、继续总结这方面的经验。对于由于生产力进一步发展所提出的一些新的人与人之间的关系，我们要及时地加以研究和处理，以便调动一切积极因素，多快好省地建设社会主义。特别是对于群众的实践，对于群众的创造，我们要更加尊重，更加虚心地学习；所谓正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，就是我们党经常说的走群众路线的问题。只有这样，我们才能掌握正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法和艺术，充分发挥主观能动性，充分发挥蕴藏在群众中的无限创造力。
    为了进一步处理人民内部的矛盾，我们要继续认真学习毛泽东同志这一著作，更好地掌握这个锐利的武器。一年来，各级党的组织、各民主党派、政府部门和人民团体的所有成员，都普遍地组织了对这一著作的学习，而且应当说学习的成绩是不坏的。例如各地区、各部门对于所遇到的各种矛盾大都作了正确的处理，打击了敌人，团结了自己，改正了许多缺点和错误，各种工作都有很大的改进，这就是一个证明。但是我们也应当指出，还有不少同志对这一著作的重大意义认识不足，对它的学习还是很不够的。学术界也存在着这种情况，而且相当严重，只不过最近才有些改进罢了。譬如说，在各地都发现有这样的情况：有些同志划不清两类矛盾的界线而常常把它们混淆起来，有些同志错误地把我国过渡时期的主要矛盾一概看作敌我矛盾，有些同志在过去一个时期曾怀疑党及时提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的正确性，有些同志还喜欢用压服代替说服的方法去处理人民内部矛盾，有些同志还没有学会运用大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报这一套办法，如此等等。这都证明不少人对于这一著作的学习是很差的，对于整风运动的经验的吸取是很不够的。所以，今后继续认真地学习毛泽东同志的这一著作，深刻体会它的精神和实质，学会应用这个锐利的思想武器，仍然是十分重要的事情。特别是现在整风运动已经进入第四阶段，即每人学习文件、批评反省、提高自己的阶段，毛泽东同志的这部著作是主要的学习文件之一，我们更应当好好地学习它。
    在学习毛泽东同志这一著作和他的其他著作的时候，我们应当特别注意学习他在实际工作中应用马克思列宁主义、应用辩证唯物论的榜样，学习他把马克思主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合、把严肃的原则精神同生动的独创精神相结合的榜样，学习他同人民群众密切联系、勇敢地为真理而奋斗、具有高尚的共产主义风格的榜样。毛泽东同志这部著作，是把唯物辩证法活生生地应用到革命实践中去的典范，是在马克思列宁主义基础上敢想敢说、富有独创精神的典范。这部著作中提出的，除了上面所说的关于两类不同的矛盾和应用不同方法处理不同性质的矛盾的观点以外，例如关于百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，关于长期共存、互相监督的方针，关于如何处理少数人闹事和把坏事变成好事的方针，关于中国工业化的道路必须实行工农业并举的方针等等，都是我们各方面工作的指针，这些也都是我们学习运用马克思列宁主义的最好榜样。毛泽东同志早就教导我们说，我们学习马克思列宁主义，就是为了从中找立场，找观点，找方法。我们学习毛泽东同志的著作，也应当本着这种态度去学习，而绝不能用教条主义的态度去学习。我们要善于把毛泽东同志的思想应用到实际工作中去，把毛泽东同志所尊重和发展了的唯物论和辩证法运用到实际工作中去。刘少奇同志在中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的报告中说：“我们应当从教条主义和经验主义的束缚下彻底解放出来，使我们的思想和工作获得生动活泼的发展。我们应当尊重群众的实践，尊重群众的革命性和创造性，这才是尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法。”我们应当本着这种精神，在全国掀起一个学习毛泽东同志著作的热潮，进一步推动共产主义的思想解放运动。
