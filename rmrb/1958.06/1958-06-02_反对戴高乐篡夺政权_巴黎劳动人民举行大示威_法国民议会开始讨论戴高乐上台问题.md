Xinhua News Agency, June 1st -- Paris Dispatch: Amidst the powerful protests of the laboring people of Paris, the French National Assembly began discussing the issue of authorizing De Gaulle to form a government at 3:00 PM Paris time today (10:00 PM Beijing time). This authorization discussion follows a series of compromise political deals between the so-called "center" parties of the French bourgeoisie and De Gaulle, with the aim of allowing De Gaulle, who is supported by fascists, to usurp power under a "legal" guise. Currently, the National Assembly's discussion is still ongoing.

Just as the National Assembly was conducting its discussion, the laboring people of Paris, responding to the call of the French Communist Party, held a powerful large-scale demonstration to oppose De Gaulle's rise to power. Groups of marchers, singing the "Marseillaise" and carrying the flag of the Republic, marched from various parts of Paris and its suburbs towards the city center. They shouted "Down with De Gaulle!" "Don't let fascism succeed!" "Long live the Republic!" The authorities dispatched a large number of armed police to occupy various railway stations, subway stations, and bus stops in an attempt to prevent demonstrators from the suburbs from entering the city. However, demonstrators continued to pour into the city.

In many parts of Paris, demonstrators clashed with the police. Large protest rallies were held in the Place de la République and the Place de la Bastille. Intimidated by the power of the people's strong protests, the government authorities reinforced the already heavily guarded National Assembly building with several thousand more troops.

In a statement to the National Assembly today, De Gaulle demanded six months of "full power" to implement dictatorial rule. He also demanded "immediate constitutional amendments" and the adoption of a "referendum" to decide on them. After the constitution is "amended," the National Assembly should adjourn for six months to allow him to wield executive and legislative power alone. He threatened that "only in this way can his government solve the major tasks it faces."

De Gaulle also announced the list of his cabinet, which includes Social Democratic right-wing leader Mollet, the recently resigned Prime Minister, Popular Republican Pflimlin, and Independent Republican Louis Jacquinot, who will serve as ministers of state equivalent to deputy prime ministers. Independent Party leader Pinay will serve as Minister of Finance, and the current ambassador to West Germany and wartime subordinate in De Gaulle's provisional government, Maurice Couve de Murville, will serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

In order to obtain the support of a majority vote in the National Assembly, forces supporting De Gaulle have been trying to win over the so-called "center" parties in the parliament, especially the Socialist Party, to agree to De Gaulle forming a cabinet. After several days of hesitation and wavering, the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party finally forced the parliamentary groups and executive committee of the party to pass a decision supporting De Gaulle's rise to power at a joint meeting on the 31st by a narrow majority of seventy-seven votes to seventy-four. However, more than half of the Socialist Party deputies in the National Assembly voted against it. Based on the advice of Mollet and other right-wing leaders who worked hard for De Gaulle, the joint meeting passed a resolution stipulating that Socialist Party deputies should decide their attitude in this National Assembly authorization vote and are not bound by the parliamentary groups, which in effect prevented the parliamentary groups from making a decision disagreeing with De Gaulle's rise to power.

On the afternoon of the 31st, other bourgeois parties in the parliament also successively made decisions to support De Gaulle. Apart from the far-right Social Republican Party (former De Gaulle faction) and the Poujadists, as well as the right-wing "Independent Party," the decisions of other so-called "center" parties were made with the opposition of a considerable number of people in the party's leadership groups.

Until formally requesting authorization from the National Assembly, De Gaulle had never clearly stated his policies on major domestic and foreign issues. However, it has been reported that De Gaulle has stated more than once during meetings with leaders of various bourgeois parties that he will "guarantee" that France remains within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will "respect" its "obligations" under various Western European treaties.

A report from Washington by United Press International indicates that the US government is already considering how to build a relationship with De Gaulle after he comes to power. Issues related to France's political and economic situation will be the main focus of discussions between Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan in early this month. Washington diplomats estimate that Eisenhower will invite De Gaulle to visit the United States in the near future.

    反对戴高乐篡夺政权
    巴黎劳动人民举行大示威
    法国民议会开始讨论戴高乐上台问题
    新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：在巴黎劳动人民的强大抗议声中，法国国民议会今天下午巴黎时间三时
  （北京时间晚十时）开始讨论授权戴高乐组织政府问题。这次授权讨论是在法国资产阶级所谓“中间”党派同戴高乐进行了一系列妥协性的政治交易以后举行的，其目的在于使受法西斯分子拥戴的戴高乐得以在“合法”外衣下篡夺政权。目前，国民议会的讨论还在继续进行中。
    正当国民议会进行讨论的时候，巴黎劳动人民响应法国共产党的号召，举行了强有力的大示威，反对戴高乐上台。成批的游行者高唱“马赛曲”，举着共和国旗由巴黎市内和郊区分头向市中心区进发。他们高呼“打倒戴高乐！”“不让法西斯主义得逞！”“共和国万岁！”当局出动了大批武装警察占据各个火车站、地下铁道车站和公共汽车站，企图阻止来自郊区的示威群众进入市区。但是示威人群仍然不断涌入市区。
    在巴黎市许多地方，示威者同警察发生了冲突。在共和国广场和巴士底广场都举行了盛大的抗议集会。慑于人民强大抗议的威力，政府当局在原来就已布满了警察岗哨的国民议会大厦周围又增调了好几千名军队来加强警戒。
    戴高乐在今天向国民议会发表的声明中，要求授给他六个月的“全权”来实行独裁统治。他还要求“立即进行宪法修改”。并且采取“公民投票”的办法来决定。在“修改”宪法之后，国民议会应休会半年，以便由他一人独揽行政和立法的大权。他要挟说，“只有这样做，他的政府才能解决它所面临的重大任务。”
    戴高乐同时宣布了内阁名单，其中社会党右翼领袖摩勒，刚刚辞职的总理、人民共和党人弗林姆兰和独立共和党的路易·雅基诺担任相当于副总理职位的国务部长。独立党领袖比内担任财政部长，现任驻西德大使、战时戴高乐临时政府中的僚属莫里斯·顾夫·德姆维尔担任外交部长。
    由于要取得国民议会中多数票的支持，连日来支持戴高乐的势力竭力拉拢议会中所谓“中间”党派，特别是社会党同意戴高乐组阁。经过好几天的迟疑和动摇，社会党右翼领导终于要挟该党两院议会党团和执行委员会在31日的联席会议上以七十七票对七十四票的微弱多数通过了支持戴高乐上台的决定。但是国民议会中半数以上的社会党议员投反对票。联席会议根据竭力为戴高乐出力的摩勒等右翼领导人的建议，通过了一项决议，规定社会党议员在这次国民议会的授权投票中自行决定态度，不受议会党团约束，这实际上就预先阻止了议会党团作出不同意戴高乐上台的决定。
    在31日下午，议会中其他资产阶级政党也相继作出了支持戴高乐的决定。除了极右翼的社会共和党（前戴高乐派）和布热德分子以及右翼“独立党”以外，其他所谓“中间”党派的决定都是在党的领导集团中相当一部分人反对下作出的。
    一直到要求国民议会正式授权以前，戴高乐始终没有明确提出过他对国内外各项重大问题的政策。但是据报道，戴高乐在同各资产阶级政党领导人会谈时，曾经不止一次地表明态度说，他将“保证”法国留在北大西洋集团之内，并且“尊重”它在各项西欧条约中所承担的“义务”。
    合众国际社从华盛顿发出的一条报道表明，美国政府已经在考虑如何同上台后的戴高乐拉关系的问题。有关法国的政治经济形势问题将是艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦本月上旬举行会谈时的首要内容。华盛顿外交人士估计艾森豪威尔即将在最近邀请戴高乐访美。
