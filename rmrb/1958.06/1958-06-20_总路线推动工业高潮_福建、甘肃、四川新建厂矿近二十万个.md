The General Line Promotes an Industrial Upsurge
Nearly 200,000 New Factories and Mines Built in Fujian, Gansu, and Sichuan

    (Reported by this newspaper) Fujian, Gansu, Sichuan and other provinces rely on the masses to vigorously develop local industries.

    In the past two months, Fujian Province has built more than 51,200 small factories and mines, of which more than 90% are run by townships and communes.

    These newly built small factories and mines include small iron mines, small coal mines, hydroelectric power stations, wind power stations, farm tool factories, and fertilizer factories, with more than 75% directly serving agricultural production.

    In the past half month, many places in Fujian Province have vigorously carried out propaganda campaigns to break the mysterious views and fear of difficulties in running industries, and boosted the enthusiasm of the whole people in running industries. Many cadres and people in the Fu'an Special District originally believed that Fu'an was located in mountainous areas, the poorest, the most blank and the most backward, and that it would be difficult to develop industry on a large scale. After repeated debates, everyone clarified the significance and guiding principles of running factories, and it only took eight days to set up 2,992 factories.

    The General Line has become an infinite force to promote a new upsurge in local industry in Gansu. As of June 10, the province has established 63,000 factories and mines.

    The vast majority of these factories face the countryside and serve agricultural production. The construction time is short and the results are quick. The farm tool repair and assembly plant in Pingliang Special District alone can produce 600,000 farm tools in a short period of time to support the summer harvest. In addition, a number of backbone factories for iron smelting, copper smelting, lead-zinc smelting, coal-to-oil, nitrogen fertilizer, and cement have also been built. The people of Pingliang Special District have built a tractor factory through self-reliance, and the universal tractors produced are of good quality and are very popular among farmers. Gansu did not have a steel industry before. In order to catch up with the United Kingdom in a shorter period of time, the people of the province are starting to build more than 190 small blast furnaces and several iron and steel joint enterprises with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons of steel at high speed, and more than 100,000 tons of steel can be produced by the end of the year. Various places have also built a number of factories that manufacture solar energy machinery and wind and water power tools. The people who were originally regarded as "backward areas" have now put forward the earth-shattering slogan: Let wind, water, and the sun serve the people!

    According to incomplete statistics from sixteen special districts, autonomous prefectures, and cities in Sichuan Province, more than 80,000 factories and mines have been built and put into production this year.

    Sichuan Province adheres to the principle of combining large, medium and small enterprises in the development of local industries. In terms of iron and steel, electricity, and fertilizer industries, this province has more than 500 small blast furnaces, more than 40,000 small hydropower stations, and thousands of small fertilizer plants run by special districts and counties this year. The province invests in the construction of four steel plants with an annual output of 150,000 to 200,000 tons, more than ten hydropower and thermal power plants with a total power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts, and several fertilizer plants with a total production capacity of 300,000 tons.

    总路线推动工业高潮
    福建、甘肃、四川新建厂矿近二十万个
    本报讯　福建、甘肃、四川等省依靠群众，大办地方工业。
    福建省近两个月来共建成小型厂矿五万一千二百多个，其中90％以上是乡、社办的。
    这些新建的小型厂矿，有小铁矿、小煤窑、水力发电站、风力站、农具厂和肥料厂等，75％以上直接为农业生产服务。
    近半个月来，福建省许多地方大张旗鼓地开展宣传运动，打破办工业的神秘观点和畏难情绪，鼓起了全民办工业的劲头。福安专区许多干部和群众原来认为福安地处山区，最穷最白最落后，大搞工业困难很多，经过反复辩论，大家明确了办厂的意义和方针路线，只花八天时间就办起二千九百九十二个工厂。
    总路线变成推动甘肃地方工业新高潮的无穷力量。截至6月10日止全省已办起六万三千个厂矿。
    这些工厂绝大部分面向农村，为农业生产服务，建设时间短，生效快，光平凉专区的农具修配厂，就可在短期内生产出六十万件农具，支援夏收。此外，还建成了一批炼铁、炼铜、炼铅锌、煤炼油、氮肥、水泥等的骨干工厂。平凉专区的人民，自力更生建成一座拖拉机厂，生产出来的万能拖拉机质量很好，深受农民欢迎；甘肃原来没有钢铁工业，全省人民为了在更短时间内赶上英国，正在以高速度着手建设一百九十多座小高炉，和几个年产一万多吨钢的钢铁联合企业，到年底就可先生产出十多万吨钢铁来。各地还建起一批制造太阳能机械和风力、水力工具的工厂，原来被看作“落后地区”的人民，现在提出了气吞山河的口号：叫风、水、太阳为人们服务！
    四川省十六个专区、自治州、市最近不完全的统计，今年建设并投入生产的厂矿已有八万多个。
    四川省在发展地方工业时，坚持贯彻大中小企业相结合的方针。这个省在钢铁、电力、化肥等工业方面，今年由专区和县办的，有五百多座小高炉、四万多个小型水电站和数以千计的小化肥厂；由省投资建设的有四座年产十五万吨到二十万吨的炼钢厂，十多个总发电能力二十万瓩的水力、火力发电站和数个总生产能力三十万吨的化肥厂。
