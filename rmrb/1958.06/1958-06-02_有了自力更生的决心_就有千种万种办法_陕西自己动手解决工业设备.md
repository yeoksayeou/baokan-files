With the Determination to Rely on Our Own Efforts, We Will Have Thousands of Ways
Shaanxi Solves Industrial Equipment Problems Through Self-Reliance

(Our Dispatch) Shaanxi Province can basically rely on its own efforts to solve the problem of machinery and equipment needed for the four thousand large, medium, and relatively complex small local industrial backbone factories and mines to be built this year.

These factories and mines need a total of more than 56,000 horsepower of various power equipment, more than 1,300 lathes, 160 sets of iron smelting, copper smelting, oil refining, and fertilizer equipment, as well as various water pumps, mining machinery, sugar making, paper making, flour milling, and other machinery and equipment.

In order to put these backbone factories and mines into production as soon as possible, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee instructed all localities to rely on their own efforts to solve the problem of machinery and equipment within the province. In accordance with this spirit, various localities mobilized the masses to come up with many effective methods:

First, through clearing warehouses, a batch of stagnant equipment that could be used was found and transferred to more than 3,000 factories and mines for use through balancing and adjustment methods.

Second, develop production and manufacture equipment locally. Many state-owned and local machinery factories in Shaanxi, as well as the practice factories of universities and colleges, together with some handicraft cooperatives, have great manufacturing potential. In early May, the Provincial People's Committee convened relevant units to study collaborative production, and they can manufacture more than 100 sets of smelting equipment, more than 32,000 horsepower of power machinery, more than 30,000 kilowatts of generators, more than 460 various lathes, and more than 20,000 sets of complete small-scale equipment for sugar making, oil pressing, rice milling, flour milling, biogas, etc., which can equip more than 1,000 construction projects.

Third, give full play to the equipment potential of various localities. In Baiyang Township, Weinan County, the power machinery used for irrigation and drainage for agriculture is only used for one-third of the year, and the remaining two-thirds of the time is idle. The masses used these power machinery for industry when they were idle. The Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to promote this method and use all the existing 60 or more irrigation and drainage power machinery in both industry and agriculture.

Fourth, use substitutes as much as possible. When making equipment, Dali County used wood to make water turbines to run flour mills because there were no steel raw materials. The county also organized a group of iron and wood workers to imitate or modify small oil presses, granular fertilizer machines, feed machines and other machines to solve the equipment problems of agricultural cooperatives running industries. With this method, Dali County has established more than 310 small factories.

Now, state-owned and local state-owned machinery industries, universities and colleges, and handicraft cooperatives in Shaanxi Province are actively and enthusiastically undertaking the task of manufacturing machinery and equipment, and are also promoting the communist spirit of mutual cooperation and overcoming difficulties in the manufacturing process. The Shaanxi Provincial Metal No. 1 Cooperative not only guarantees the completion of the production task of 25 winches, but also automatically proposed to undertake the production task of 20 sets of iron smelting blast furnace equipment and 28 boilers. In addition to the tasks already assigned, the Tongchuan Central Machine Repair Factory also decided to overcome difficulties and accept the production tasks of 20 pumps and 40 nodular cast iron machines. The Yumin Iron Factory in Baoji City plans to accept the production task of 100 boilers, but has difficulties in mechanical processing. A certain technical school immediately stated that it would provide support in mechanical processing. Cooperative relationships have also been established between other factories or cooperatives, and between factories and universities and colleges.

Shaanxi Province has more than 20,000 local industrial enterprises that are being built or will be built this year. Among them, about 10,000 projects are run by townships and cooperatives, and most of them are manual operations. The simple equipment needed can be solved by local organizations through handicraft processing and manufacturing. The remaining 10,000 projects require more or less machinery and equipment. In view of this situation, the provincial leadership departments recently arranged for relevant units to produce a batch of irrigation and drainage equipment, and various units also cleared out a portion of machinery from their warehouses, plus some machinery allocated by the state, which can already solve the equipment needed for about 3,000 construction projects.

### 有了自力更生的决心　就有千种万种办法  陕西自己动手解决工业设备

    有了自力更生的决心　就有千种万种办法
    陕西自己动手解决工业设备
    本报讯　陕西省今年内兴建的四千个大、中型和比较复杂的小型地方工业骨干厂矿，所需机械设备可以基本上依靠自力更生的办法解决。
    这批厂矿共需各种动力设备五万六千多马力，一千三百多台车床，一百六十套炼铁、炼铜、炼油和化肥设备，还有各种水泵、矿山机械、制糖、造纸、磨粉等机器设备。
    为了使这批骨干厂矿尽快投入生产，中共陕西省委和省人民委员会曾指示各地依靠自力更生，在省内解决机器设备问题。根据这一精神，各地发动群众想出了许多有效办法：
    一、通过清理仓库，查出一批可以利用的呆滞设备，用平衡、调剂办法调给三千多个厂矿应用。
    二、发展生产，就地制造设备。陕西许多国营和地方机械厂、大专院校的实习工厂，连同部分手工业社，制造潜力很大。5月上旬，省人民委员会召集有关单位研究协作生产，可以自己制造出一百多套冶炼设备、三万二千多马力的动力机械，三万多瓩的发电机，四百六十多台各种车床，和两万多套制糖、榨油、碾米、磨面、沼气等成套小型设备，可以装备一千多个建设项目。
    三、发挥各地设备潜力。渭南县白杨乡农业用的排灌动力机械，一年只用到三分之一时间，其余三分之二时间都闲置着，群众便把这些动力机械在闲置时用于工业。中共渭南县委已决定推广这个办法，把全县已有的六十多部排灌动力机械，都在工农业上兼用。
    四、尽量使用代用品。大荔县在自制设备时，没有钢铁原料，就先用木头做成水轮机办面粉厂。这个县还组织一批铁、木工，仿造或改制小型榨油机、颗粒肥料机、饲料机等机具，解决农业社办工业的设备。用这个办法，大荔县已办起三百一十多个小型厂子。
    现在，陕西省国营和地方国营机械工业、大专院校和手工业社，主动热情地承接制造机器设备的任务，并且发扬了互相配合协作的共产主义精神，克服制造过程中的困难。陕西省金属一社不但保证完成二十五部绞车的生产任务，还自动提出愿承接二十套炼铁高炉设备和二十八台锅炉的生产任务。铜川中央机修厂除已分配的任务外，也决定克服困难，再接受二十台泵和四十部球墨机的生产任务。宝鸡市裕民铁工厂打算接受一百台锅炉的生产任务，但机械加工方面有困难，某技工学校立即表示要在机械加工方面给予支援。其他厂与厂或社之间、厂与大专院校之间，也都建立了协作关系。
    陕西省今年正在兴建和即将兴建的地方工业企业共有二万多个。其中约有一万多个项目是乡、社办的，大多是手工操作，所需简单设备可由当地组织手工业加工制造解决。其余一万个项目，或多或少需要机器设备。根据这种情况，不久前省的领导部门曾给有关单位安排生产了一批排灌设备，各单位还从仓库中清理出一部分机器，加上国家拨给一些机器，已经大约可以解决三千个建设项目左右所需的设备。
