    Learn from the Lessons of Shaanxi

    "Bi Ma No. 1" is an excellent variety of wheat. Over the past seven years, Shaanxi Province has increased its wheat production by a total of 2.4 billion jin by promoting this variety. However, Shaanxi Province also suffered a major loss as a result of concentrating on planting "Bi Ma No. 1" in large quantities - a total loss of more than 300 million jin of wheat in 1956 and 1957. Practice has proven that the singularization of good wheat varieties is detrimental to production.

    Learning from the lessons of Shaanxi Province, we should not only prevent singularization when promoting good wheat varieties, but also conduct regular inspections and appraisals of the good varieties that have already been promoted; at the same time, we should regard relying on the masses to discover and cultivate good varieties as a regular and important task. Only when new good varieties continue to emerge and be promoted can the old good varieties be continuously transformed or eliminated.

    接受陕西的教训
    “碧蚂一号”是小麦的优良品种。陕西省七年来，由于推广这个品种，共增产小麦二十四亿斤。但是，陕西省集中大量种植“碧蚂一号”的结果却也吃了一个大亏——1956和1957两年共损失小麦三亿多斤。实践证明小麦良种单一化对生产不利。
    我们接受陕西省的教训，不仅在推广小麦良种时要防止单一化，对已经推广的良种还要进行经常的考察和鉴定；同时，应该把依靠群众发现和培育良种，作为经常的重要任务，只有新的良种不断出现、不断推广，才能使旧的良种不断得到改造或淘汰。
