　　East Wind Rolls Up Red Clouds (and Another Poem)
　　Sha Ou
　　The east wind rolls up red clouds,
　　Red light brightens the Mangshan Mountain,
　　Chairman Mao has been here,
　　The mountains and rivers have changed their appearance.
　　People talk intimately,
　　At the construction site, by the roadside,
　　The happy moment is forever unforgettable,
　　Seeing Chairman Mao so healthy.
　　His laughter is still here,
　　His warmth remains on the shovel;
　　Look at the dam tonight,
　　It will rise three feet three!

　　Dragon King Sneaks a Peek at the Dam
　　The Dragon King left the Crystal Palace,
　　Rushing hastily, his steps in disarray.
　　Parting the clouds to look down,
　　He was shocked and broke out in a sweat.
　　The Thirteen Tombs, the scenery has changed,
　　The east and west mountain peaks are invisible,
　　The dam blocks the way,
　　Like a mountain being cut in half,
　　Only the roar of machines is heard,
　　Only thousands upon thousands of people are seen.
　　Small carts, like long snakes,
　　Each one heads straight for the dam.
　　Ten thousand cubic meters of sand and stone, ten thousand dan of earth,
　　Some push, some carry,
　　The conveyor belt is like a waterfall,
　　Sand and soil sent to the top of the dam,
　　Sheep foot rollers, large rammers,
　　Go back and forth, rolling and pressing, the mountain trembles,
　　The dam grows day and night,
　　It looks like it will reach the sky.
　　The Dragon King's liver and gallbladder cracked from fright,
　　Veins bulging on his forehead, his legs weakened,
　　Just as he was about to return to the palace to arrange his affairs,
　　Suddenly he heard thunder roaring through the mountains:
　　"Go all out for three days,
　　The earthwork target will be five ten-thousands dan per day!"
　　Only cheers covered the dam,
　　Red flags fluttering, reflecting the clouds.
　　The wind blows fiercely like fire,
　　People surge like a tide, sweat like a spring,
　　Determination is greater than the sky,
　　The dam construction plan is set to be completed ahead of schedule!
　　The Dragon King sighed three times with tears,
　　Blaming himself for being too slow,
　　Pressing the flood is useless,
　　The gate has been closed by iron hands.
　　From now on, the dragons are trapped in the reservoir,
　　A thousand arrows pierce their hearts, they dare not look...

　　东风把红云漫卷（外一首）
　　沙鸥
　　东风把红云漫卷，
　　红光擦亮了莽山，
　　毛主席来过这里，
　　山河改变了容颜。
　　人们亲切地谈论，
　　在工地、在路边，
　　幸福的时刻永远难忘，
　　看见毛主席那么康健。
　　他的笑声还在，
　　铁锹上留下他的温暖；
　　看今夜拦河大坝，
　　将猛升三尺三！
　　龙王偷看拦河坝
　　龙王出了水晶殿，
　　急忙奔，脚步乱。
　　拨开云头向下瞧，
　　大吃一惊直冒汗。
　　十三陵，景色变，
　　东西山头看不见，
　　拦河大坝挡着路，
　　好比大山被腰斩，
　　只听机器轰隆响，
　　只见人马千千万。
　　小斗车，像长蛇，
　　条条直奔大坝前。
　　万方砂石万担土，
　　推的推来担的担，
　　传送皮带像瀑布，
　　砂土送到坝上面，
　　羊脚碾，大夯板，
　　来去碾压山抖颤，
　　拦河大坝日夜长，
　　眼看就要长上天。
　　龙王看得肝胆裂，
　　青筋满额腿发软，
　　正想回宫办后事，
　　忽闻滚雷震群山：
　　“鼓足干劲战三日，
　　日上土方破五万！”
　　但见欢呼盖大坝，
　　红旗翻转映云天。
　　狂风吹得劲如火，
　　人如潮涌汗如泉，
　　决心本来比天大，
　　筑坝计划定提前！
　　龙王挥泪叹三声，
　　只怪自己走得慢，
　　催逼洪水已无用，
　　大门已被铁手关。
　　从此群龙困水库，
　　万箭穿心不敢看…
