Using Steel Where it Counts
    ——Zunyi County Local Industry Communication Three
    Our reporters Zhou Jingyu, Guo Longchun

The booming and vigorous atmosphere of Zunyi County in running industry signifies their successful implementation of the mass line of "the whole party runs industry, all levels run industry, and the whole people run industry." However, compared with the past when only the county's industrial departments ran industry, this has also increased the complexity of the work: it is necessary to twist the forces of all parties into one rope and let everyone's energy be used where it counts.

After the Zunyi County Party Committee conveyed the central government's policy in early March, cadres and the masses in the county immediately took action, truly "everyone competing to be Zhuge Liang," coming up with various methods, overcoming numerous difficulties, and vigorously running local industry. For example, the Xiazi District launched a mass campaign on March 11th and 12th, establishing more than 900 small factories and mines all at once. However, "everything is difficult at the beginning." Running local industry on such a large scale in China's land was unprecedented, and no one had experience. Who could have foreseen everything in advance? Some noteworthy situations occurred:

The Shangji District originally had a local state-owned iron factory, but agricultural cooperatives set up two more iron smelting factories nearby. The supply of charcoal needed for iron smelting became strained.

All districts were running local state-owned rayon factories, and the county handicraft industry cooperative also wanted to run three, but the raw material problem could not be solved.

The industrial department planned to build a cannery and four meat processing plants this year, and the commercial department also wanted to run a meat processing plant. As a result, there were conflicts in raw materials and sales. ...

These practices caused a certain waste in manpower and materials, and at the same time, they could not concentrate forces to first build projects urgently needed for production.

The county party committee promptly analyzed these situations and reached two conclusions: first, it is necessary to clarify the direction of running local industry and oppose the view of simply pursuing profits; second, it is necessary to strengthen overall planning, take into account all aspects, and divide labor and cooperate. The purpose of doing this is to protect and fully develop the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and concentrate the efforts of all parties to "use steel where it counts."

First, Contribute to 800 Jin
The county party committee studied the tasks of local industry and put forward the slogan "First serve 800 jin." In the 40-article outline (draft) of Zunyi County's 1958-1962 industrial development, the county party committee made specific provisions for the direction of running local industry:

"According to the central government's policy, combined with the specific situation of our county, the tasks of local industry in the future are first: to face the countryside, combine with agriculture, serve agricultural production, and serve the needs of the local people's lives; at the same time, also serve large-scale industry and basic construction; and serve to increase foreign exchange export materials. The focus of industrial development in the next five years should be: (1) the manufacture and repair of agricultural machinery; (2) chemical fertilizers; (3) fuel and electricity; (4) iron and non-ferrous metals; (5) the processing of various agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline products; (6) the daily necessities of the people."

After the direction was clarified, some factories and mines that some agricultural cooperatives originally wanted to run that were not closely related to agriculture were postponed or suspended. They put more effort into projects that promote agricultural production increase.

Twisting Strands of Power into One Rope
All levels must run industry. However, how to organize the forces of the four levels of county, district, township, and cooperative well, and avoid and reduce duplication and waste? This requires strengthening overall arrangements, division of labor and cooperation.

The 40-article outline (draft) of Zunyi County's 1958-1962 industrial development made specific provisions for the division of labor in running industry at the county, district, township, and cooperative levels:

The county runs the manufacture of agricultural machinery and the repair and assembly of large agricultural tools, larger power stations, coal mines, iron factories, as well as larger backbone industries such as coal-to-oil, cement, machine-made paper, machine-made sugar, cotton spinning, silk weaving, joint meat processing, and flue-cured tobacco re-baking.

The district runs the repair of new-style agricultural tools and the manufacture of ox-cart and horse-cart, small power stations, high-grade granular fertilizer, rayon, machine-pressed oil, brewing, feed processing, meat processing, grain processing, handmade paper, and other small factories and mines.

Townships run general granular fertilizer, brewing, starch, soda ash, saltpeter and other industries.

The industry of agricultural cooperatives is mainly seasonal, sideline, and technically simple processing industry.

In order to give play to the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives in running industry and to make full use of the accumulated funds of agricultural cooperatives, more industries jointly run by townships and cooperatives can be established.

There is also the issue of economic departments of non-industrial systems running industry.

Now it seems that it is very necessary to organize economic departments of non-industrial systems to run industry. First, these departments' funds can be utilized. Zunyi County's non-industrial departments (grain department, commercial department, handicraft cooperative) can concentrate 400,000 yuan this year to run industry, and 5 million yuan can be concentrated within five years. Second, the manpower and equipment of these departments can be fully utilized. Third, mutual allocation of some raw materials and products can be reduced.

However, this also requires unified arrangements with industrial departments and agricultural cooperatives. The principle determined by the Zunyi County Party Committee is: each non-industrial department should run projects closely related to its own business. For example, the grain department runs rice mills; the commercial department runs food processing plants (such as sugar cakes and pastries) and local specialty processing plants (such as tea); the handicraft cooperative runs agricultural tool repair stations, ox-cart and horse-cart factories, pottery factories, etc. After balanced planning, non-industrial departments in the county can run 72 industrial projects this year, accounting for 19% of newly built projects above the township level.

Zunyi County also paid attention to regular overall collaboration. In addition to the county party committee promptly studying and solving some major problems, the county established a basic construction preparation committee and a material supply office, and personnel from several relevant departments participated to jointly study and solve some specific problems in raw materials, equipment, and funds.

"Squeezing" is Not Allowed
In the process of vigorously running local industry, some districts and townships in Zunyi County once had sharp contradictions with handicraft cooperatives. This contradiction was manifested on the one hand by the fact that the county handicraft industry cooperative planned some projects that were not very closely related to its own business, which overlapped with the projects run by districts and townships; on the other hand, some districts and townships had a tendency to "squeeze" handicraft cooperatives.

"Squeezing" is mainly manifested in: First, forcibly pulling the technical personnel of handicraft cooperatives. For example, the Xiazi District drew four skilled members from the handicraft cooperative to run an agricultural tool iron factory. Second, pulling handicraft cooperatives to transfer to local state-owned factories.

These practices directly affected the normal production of handicraft cooperatives, and at the same time caused ideological unrest among some handicraft cooperative members.

This phenomenon is mainly because some cadres in districts and townships did not regard handicraft cooperatives as part of local industry for overall planning, and did not make good use of the original foundation of handicraft cooperatives, but instead treated them as a strong assistant to local state-owned industry. When some areas took the above measures, they also said that it was to develop industrial production and to support agriculture. The actual result is often the opposite. The technical personnel drawn from the handicraft cooperative in the Xiazi District produced shotguns in the agricultural tool iron factory. Due to incomplete equipment and poor management, it took four days to make a gun barrel; these people could make a gun barrel in only one and a half days in the handicraft cooperative. It can be seen from this that taking measures to strengthen leadership and actively support handicraft cooperatives to effectively carry out their own business is not more beneficial to developing industrial production and supporting agricultural leap forward?

The Zunyi County Party Committee had long proposed the principle of "three families (industrial departments, non-industrial departments, agricultural cooperatives) running factories, unified arrangements," and at the telephone conference of various districts held on April 30, it once again criticized the idea of not attaching importance to giving play to the role of handicraft cooperatives, and specifically stipulated: First, handicraft cooperatives shall not be transferred to local state-owned factories; those that meet the conditions can be transferred to cooperative factories. Second, the personnel of handicraft cooperatives shall not be arbitrarily pulled to engage in voluntary labor for agricultural cooperatives and factories. Third, the districts should comprehensively plan and make overall arrangements for the raw materials, fuels, etc. needed by factories and mines and handicraft cooperatives.

Through this stage of practice, the direction of running local industry has been clarified, the principle of division of labor and cooperation between various levels and departments has been determined, and some cooperative systems have been established. Zunyi County's local industry has embarked on the track of planned and large-scale development. Of course, the issue of cooperation is also related to relations with other cities and counties. For example, the seat of the Zunyi County People's Committee is only 20 kilometers away from Zunyi City, and the vast rural areas of Zunyi County surround Zunyi City, while the city's equipment and technical strength are easy to solve, and the county has abundant raw materials. Therefore, some industrial projects in the two places can further strengthen cooperation. The Zunyi Prefectural Party Committee is already specifically arranging these issues.

    把钢使在刀刃上
    ——遵义县地方工业通讯之三
    本报记者　周静宇　郭龙春
    遵义县轰轰烈烈蓬蓬勃勃办工业的气象，标志着他们成功地贯彻了“全党办工业，各级办工业，全民办工业”的群众路线。但是同过去仅仅由县工业部门办工业比较起来，这也增加了工作的复杂性：需要把各方面的力量拧成一股绳，让大家的劲头都使在刀刃上。
    遵义县委在3月上旬传达中央的方针以后，全县干部、群众马上行动起来，真是“人人赛诸葛”，想出各种办法，克服重重困难，大办地方工业。例如，虾子区在3月11日和12日两天，来了个全民突击，一下子就办起了九百多个小型厂矿。但是，“万事起头难”。在中国的土地上这样大规模地办地方工业是破天荒第一遭，大家都没有经验，谁能事先把各方面都设想得那么周到呢？一些值得注意的情况发生了：
    尚稽区原来有个地方国营的铁厂，农业社却在附近又办了两个炼铁厂。炼铁需要的木炭供应紧张了。
    各区都在办地方国营的人造棉厂，县手工业联社也要办三个，但是原料问题不能解决。
    工业部门今年计划建一个罐头厂和四个肉食加工厂，商业部门也要办肉食加工厂。于是，原料、销路彼此冲突了。……
    这些作法都在人力、物力方面造成一定的浪费，同时又不能集中力量首先建设生产中迫切需要的项目。
    县委及时分析了这些情况，得出两个结论：一、需要明确办地方工业的方向，反对单纯追求利润的观点；二、需要加强全面规划，统筹兼顾，分工协作。这样作的目的，是为了保护和充分发挥干部、群众的积极性，集中各方面的力量，“把钢使在刀刃上”。
    首先为八百斤出力
    县委研究了地方工业的任务，提出了“首先为八百斤服务”的口号。在遵义县1958—1962年工业发展纲要四十条（草案）中，县委对办地方工业的方向作了具体规定：
    “根据中央的方针，结合我县的具体情况，今后地方工业的任务首先是：面向农村，同农业相结合，为农业生产服务，为当地人民生活需要服务；同时，也为大工业和基本建设服务；为增加外汇出口物资服务。五年内发展工业的重点应该是：（1）农业机械的制造和修配；（2）化学肥料；（3）燃料及电力；（4）铁及有色金属；（5）各种农林牧及副产品的加工；（6）人民必需的生活资料。”
    方向明确以后，有些农业社原来要办的一些同农业关系不大的厂矿，就缓办或停办了。他们以更多的力量投入了促进农业增产的项目。
    股股力量拧成一根绳
    各级都要办工业。可是，怎样把县、区、乡、社四级的力量组织好，避免和减少重复浪费呢？这就需要加强统筹安排，分工协作。
    遵义县1958—1962年工业发展纲要四十条（草案）中、对县、区、乡、社办工业的分工作了具体规定：
    县办农业机械的制造和大型农具的修配、较大的电站、煤矿、铁厂，以及煤炼油、水泥、机制纸、机制糖、棉纺织、丝织、联合肉类加工、烤烟复烤等较大型的骨干工业。
    区办新式农具的修理和牛马板车的制造、小电站、高级颗粒肥料、人造棉、机榨油、酿酒、饲料加工、肉类加工、粮食加工、手工纸等小型厂矿。
    乡办一般颗粒肥料、酿酒、淀粉、土碱、火硝等工业。
    农业社的工业主要是季节性的、副业性的、技术简单的加工工业。
    为了发挥农业社办工业的积极性和充分利用农业社的积累资金，可以多办乡社合办的工业。
    这里还有个非工业系统的经济部门办工业的问题。
    现在看来，组织非工业系统的经济部门办工业很有必要。第一、可以利用这些部门的资金。遵义县非工业部门（粮食部门、商业部门、手工业社）今年就可以集中四十万元办工业，五年内可以集中五百万元。第二、可以充分发挥这些部门人力和设备的作用。第三、可以减少部分原料、产品的相互调拨。
    但是，这也需要同工业部门、农业社作统一安排。遵义县委确定的原则是：各个非工业部门应该举办同本身业务有密切关系的项目。例如，粮食部门办机米厂；商业部门办食品加工厂（如糖食糕点）、土特产加工厂（如茶叶）；手工业社办农具修配站、牛马板车厂、陶器厂，等等。经过平衡规划，全县非工业部门今年可以办七十二个工业项目，占乡以上新建项目的19％。
    遵义县还注意了经常的统筹协作。除县委及时研究解决一些重大问题以外，县里成立了基本建设筹备委员会和物资供应办公室，几个有关部门都派人参加，共同研究解决原料、设备、资金等方面的一些具体问题。
    “挤”不得
    遵义县部分区、乡在大办地方工业的过程中，曾经同手工业社发生了尖锐的矛盾。这种矛盾一方面表现为县手工业联社规划了一部分与本身业务关系不是十分密切的项目，同区、乡办的项目重复；另一方面，是部分区、乡有“挤”手工业社的倾向。
      “挤”，主要表现在：一、硬拉手工业社的技术人员。例如，虾子区就从手工业社抽去四个技术较好的社员办农具铁工厂。二、拉手工业社转地方国营厂。
    这些作法直接影响了手工业社的正常生产，同时造成部分手工业社员思想动荡不安。
    这种现象，主要是因为部分区、乡干部没有把手工业社当作地方工业的一部分加以统筹安排，不去很好地利用手工业社原有的基础，把它们作为地方国营工业的有力助手。有些地区在采取上述作法的时候，也说是为了发展工业生产，为了支援农业。实际的结果却往往相反。虾子区从手工业社抽出的技术人员在农具铁工厂生产鸟枪，由于设备不全，管理不善，四天才做好一支枪筒；这些人原来在手工业社里，只要一天半就能制好一支枪筒。由此可见，采取加强领导、积极支持的办法，使手工业社切实搞好本身业务，对于发展工业生产、支援农业跃进，不是更加有利吗？
    遵义县委早就提出过“三家（工业部门、非工业部门、农业社）办厂，统一安排”等原则，在4月30日召开的各区电话会议上，又再次批判了不重视发挥手工业社作用的思想，并且具体规定：一、手工业社一律不转地方国营工厂；有条件的，可以转为合作工厂。二、手工业社的人员，不得随意拉去为农业社和工厂搞义务劳动。三、厂矿和手工业社需要的原料、燃料等，各区要全面规划，统筹安排。
    经过这个阶段的实践，明确了办地方工业的方向，确定了各级、各部门分工协作的原则，建立起一些协作的制度，遵义县地方工业已经走上了有计划地大踏步发展的轨道。当然，协作问题还关联到同其他市、县的关系。譬如说，遵义县人民委员会所在地同遵义市只相距二十公里，遵义县的广大农村环绕着遵义市，而市里设备、技术力量容易解决，县里有丰富的原料，因此，两地有些工业项目就可以进一步加强协作。遵义地委已经在具体安排这些问题。
