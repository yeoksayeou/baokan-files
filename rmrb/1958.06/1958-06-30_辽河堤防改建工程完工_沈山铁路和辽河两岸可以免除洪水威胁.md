Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 29th: The Liao River embankment reconstruction project in Liaoning Province was completed on June 27, one and a half years ahead of schedule.

The Liao River embankment reconstruction project is the main part of the entire Liao River flood control plan and is a massive undertaking. The river embankment project extends from Xinmin Xindian to Panshan on the right bank, and from Shenyang Dalitaizi to Panshan Beijia Wopu on the left bank, passing through the five counties of Shenyang, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Tai'an, and Panshan. It is 347 kilometers long, involving a total of over 21 million cubic meters of earthwork and over 58,000 cubic meters of stonework.

This project started in 1955 and was originally planned to take five years to complete. Thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity displayed by all the cadres and the vast number of workers on the construction site, who were always full of energy, the project progressed rapidly and was successfully completed in three and a half years, saving the country more than 890,000 workdays and more than 4 million yuan in construction funds. At the same time, in addition to completing the entire dyke reconstruction project, two flood diversion weirs and one flood control gate were also built for the country.

The reconstructed Liao River dyke has an average height of five to six meters and is solid and strong. In the event of a major flood that occurs once every fifty years (flow rate of 5,000 cubic meters per second), it can ensure that the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan railway line and 476,000 hectares of land on both sides of the Liao River are not threatened by floods. If an extraordinary flood of more than 5,000 cubic meters per second occurs, the safety of the river dyke can also be guaranteed through the method of flood diversion by the diversion weirs, so as to prevent flooding.

In the past, the Liao River was a disaster-prone river, often experiencing "major disasters with heavy rain and minor disasters with light rain." The losses caused by floods over the years were very serious. Not only were hundreds of thousands of hectares of land on both sides of the river inundated, but the safety of nearby industrial and mining cities and the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan railway was also frequently threatened.

### 辽河堤防改建工程完工  沈山铁路和辽河两岸可以免除洪水威胁

    辽河堤防改建工程完工
    沈山铁路和辽河两岸可以免除洪水威胁
    新华社沈阳29日电　辽宁省辽河堤防改建工程，已在6月27日提前一年半完工。
    辽河堤防改建工程，是整个辽河防洪规划的主要部分，工程浩大。河堤工程右岸从新民新店到盘山，左岸从沈阳大里台子到盘山贝家窝铺，中间经过沈阳、新民、辽中、台安、盘山五个县，全长三百四十七公里，共作土方二千一百多万立方公尺、石方五万八千多立方公尺。
    这项工程是1955年开工的，原计划五年才能完成。由于工地全体干部和广大民工，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，一直是干劲冲天，因此工程进度很快，三年半就胜利完成了，给国家节省了八十九万多个工日和四百多万元建设资金。同时，除完成全部大堤改建工程以外，还给国家修建两座溢洪堰和一处防洪闸。
    经过改建后的辽河大堤，平均高度为五至六公尺，结实坚固。在五十年一遇的大洪水（流量五千秒公方）情况下，可以保证沈（阳）山（海关）线铁路和辽河两岸四十七万六千多公顷土地不受洪水威胁。如果一旦遇上五千秒公方以上的特大洪水时，也可以通过溢洪堰分洪的办法，保证河堤安全，不致泛滥成灾。
    辽河，过去是一条多灾多难的河，常是“大雨大灾，小雨小灾”，历年泛滥所造成的损失非常严重。不仅两岸数十万公顷土地被淹，而且附近工矿城市的安全和沈——山铁路也经常受到威胁。
