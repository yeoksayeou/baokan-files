This newspaper's Nanchang dispatch on the 16th: Yang Caishui, a worker, and Liu Junxin, a technician, at the Ji'an Highway Transportation Bureau Automotive Maintenance Depot in Jiangxi Province, boldly broke away from the mystique surrounding steelmaking and successfully refined steel using indigenous methods. According to tests conducted by the state-owned Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory, the steel produced by them using indigenous methods fully meets the quality standards for medium-carbon steel and high-carbon steel.

Medium-carbon steel and high-carbon steel have a wide range of uses and can be used to manufacture machine components and parts for transportation, mining, and other industries. In the past, mechanical factories lacking steelmaking equipment often could not meet the demand for these two types of steel. Now that there are indigenous methods for steelmaking, this problem can be successfully resolved.

Yang Caishui started learning blacksmithing at the age of sixteen and is now an experienced ironworker with eighteen years of experience. He is still semi-literate and had never refined steel before. Liu Junxin is a young technician who studied automotive mechanical manufacturing. The equipment at the automotive maintenance depot is also very rudimentary, with only a machine shop and a forge shop, but no foundry shop. Under these extremely difficult conditions, they were inspired by the General Line and uncovered the secret of steelmaking, finding a way to refine steel.

Their indigenous method of steelmaking is as follows: in a blacksmith's furnace, the materials are placed in a crucible and surrounded by coke for burning. The raw materials used to refine medium-carbon steel are: two and a half jin of pig iron, one jin of scrap steel, and one tael of aluminum; another time, they used one and a half jin of scrap iron, two jin of pig iron, two and a half jin of scrap steel, and one and a half tael of aluminum. The raw materials used to refine high-carbon steel are: two qian of lump lime, three jin of pig iron, one jin of scrap steel, and one and a half tael of aluminum. Each melting process takes about one and a half hours, at a temperature of about 1500 degrees Celsius.

Now, they have mastered the various components of steel, such as carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus, as well as the carbon content of locally produced pig iron, through testing. They can now completely use pig iron or cast iron mixed with coke in a melting furnace to refine molten iron, and then process it with an air compressor within ten minutes to turn it into molten steel. This will solve the problem of small crucible steelmaking capacity and low steel output, and will provide a way for large-scale steelmaking in the future.

### 打铁炉上出钢水  吉安汽车保养场工人用土法炼成钢

    打铁炉上出钢水
    吉安汽车保养场工人用土法炼成钢
    本报南昌16日电　江西省吉安公路运输局汽车保养场工人杨才水和技术员刘钧信，大胆破除炼钢的神秘观点，采用土办法炼钢成功。根据国营南昌柴油机厂化验证明，他们用土办法所炼的钢材，完全合乎中炭钢和高炭钢质量。
    中炭钢和高炭钢的用途极广，可以制造运输、矿山等多种机器的机件和零件。过去在一般缺乏炼钢设备的机械厂，这两种钢材经常不能满足需要，现在炼钢有了土办法，这个问题就可以顺利获得解决。
    杨才水从十六岁开始学打铁，现在已是一个有了十八年工龄的老铁工。他现在还是个半文盲，过去从未炼过钢。刘钧信是一个青年技术员，学的是汽车机械制造。汽车保养场的设备也十分简陋，只有车工间和锻工间，没有铸工翻砂间。在这种极困难的条件下，他们在总路线的鼓舞下揭开了炼钢的秘密，找到了炼钢的办法。
    他们炼钢的土办法是：在打铁炉上，把材料放在坩锅内，四围用焦炭围烧。炼出的中炭钢所用的原料是：毛铁两斤半，废钢一斤，铝一两；另一次是用废铁一斤半，毛铁两斤，废钢两斤半，铝一两半。所炼成的高炭钢原材料是：块石灰两钱，毛铁三斤，废钢一斤，铝一两半。每次熔化时间约一小时半，温度一千五百度左右。
    现在，他们已化验掌握了钢材所含碳、硅、锰、磷等各种成分以及本地产的毛铁所含碳的成分。他们已经完全可以用毛铁或生铁加焦炭，在熔铁炉中混合炼成铁水，然后在十分钟内用空气压缩机加工处理，使其成为钢水。这样就可以解决坩锅炼钢容量小、出钢少的问题，为以后大量炼钢找到了办法。
