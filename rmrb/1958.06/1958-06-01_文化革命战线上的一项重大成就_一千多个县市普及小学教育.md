Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: A mass movement to popularize primary education is vigorously developing throughout the country. From February to the end of May this year, seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Henan, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, and Zhejiang, have basically popularized primary education. According to incomplete statistics from another twenty-three provinces and autonomous regions, 1,070 counties and cities have also basically popularized primary education, with school enrollment rates for school-age children ranging from 90% to over 98%.

The mass movement to popularize primary education, under the leadership of the Party and with the masses taking action themselves, has developed rapidly. In Baipo Village, Baipo Township, Yancheng County, Henan Province, a primary school was established in one day and one night on February 26th. The entire township popularized primary education in seven days. After this experience was promoted throughout the province, Henan Province established more than 37,400 new primary schools from early March to early May. The total number of primary school students in the province reached more than 7,230,000, with an enrollment rate for school-age children reaching 95%. In Jiangxi Province, where mountainous areas account for a significant proportion, more than 19,000 new private primary schools were also established in just over two months, enrolling more than 620,000 children, bringing the province's enrollment rate for school-age children to 98.9%. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 47 counties and banners have popularized primary education. In the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province, where few children in mountain villages attended school before liberation, primary education has also been popularized, with 90.7% of school-age children of all ethnic groups now enrolled. The autonomous prefecture recently sent 386 educational cadres of various ethnic groups to the mountains to help consolidate the newly established schools.

During the five years of the First Five-Year Plan, the number of primary school students increased by more than 33 million nationwide. However, in the past four months alone, the number of primary school students increased in eleven provinces and regions, including Jiangsu and Hebei, is equivalent to more than one-third of the increase over the past five years.

The mass movement to achieve the popularization of primary education in various localities has been carried out in the context of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production nationwide. In recent years, rural cooperativization and rapid production development have meant that most farmers have surplus money to support their children's education. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has allowed farmers to see the bright prospects of socialism and to personally experience that improving production requires culture and technology. Farmers in Baipo Township, Yancheng County, Henan Province, said: "Cooperativization, strong strength, increased production is guaranteed; tractors, go to the countryside, but culture cannot keep up." The strong demand of the masses to learn culture has become a powerful driving force for the development of the mass movement in education. The Party and the state have determined the educational work policy and put forward the mass line for running schools, criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas existing among educational workers, and broken down the mysterious concept of running schools. Under the situation that the masses urgently want to run schools, the popularization of primary schools has become a natural trend. Strengthening the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over cultural and educational work is the key to the smooth development of the mass movement in education.

Now, the newly established schools, under the leadership of the Party, are run, managed, and supported by the masses themselves. They are simple and use local materials, implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, working and studying diligently, and producing diligently. At present, areas that have popularized primary education are consolidating and improving newly established schools. In areas that have not yet achieved the popularization of primary education, the mass movement in education is still developing.

　　文化革命战线上的一项重大成就
    一千多个县市普及小学教育
    新华社31日讯　普及小学教育的群众办学运动正在全国蓬勃开展，从今年2月至5月底止，已有江苏、河南、福建、湖南、江西、黑龙江、浙江等七个省基本上普及了小学教育。另据二十三个省、自治区不完全的统计，已有一千零七十个县、市基本上普及了小学教育，学龄儿童入学率占90％到98％强。
    普及小学教育的群众办学运动在党的领导下，群众自己动手，发展得很快。河南省郾城县白坡乡白坡村，在2月26日一天一夜办起一所小学，全乡七天普及了小学教育，这一经验在全省推广后，河南省从3月初到5月上旬，群众新办小学三万七千四百多所，全省在校的小学生总数达到七百二十三万多人，学龄儿童入学率达到95％。在山区面积比重相当大的江西省，也在两个多月内新建立一万九千多所民办小学校，招收了六十二万多名儿童入学，使全省适龄儿童入学率达到98.9％。内蒙古自治区也有四十七个县、旗普及了小学教育。解放前在几十里山寨很少有儿童入学的湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州，也已经普及小学教育，90.7％的各族适龄儿童都已入学，自治州最近派了三百八十六名各族教育干部上山，帮助巩固新办的学校。
    第一个五年计划期间的五年内，全国发展小学增加小学生三千三百多万人；但最近四个月来，江苏、河北等十一个省、区所增加的小学在校人数，即等于过去五年内的三分之一以上。
    各地实现普及小学教育的群众运动，是在全国工农业生产大跃进的形势下开展的。近几年来，农村合作化，生产迅速发展，大多数农民都有余钱供给子女入学。工农业生产大跃进，农民看到了社会主义的美好远景，切身体会到，要提高生产，必须要有文化和技术。河南省郾城县白坡乡的农民说：“合作化，力量强，增加生产有保障；拖拉机，下了乡，就是文化跟不上”。群众强烈要求学习文化，成为群众办学运动开展起来的强大动力。党和国家确定了教育工作的方针政策，提出了办学的群众路线，批判了教育工作者中间存在的各种右倾保守思想，破除了办学的神秘观念。在群众迫切办学的形势下，普及小学便有水到渠成之势。各级党委加强了对文教工作的领导，是使群众办学运动顺利发展的关键。
    现在，新办的学校，在党的领导下，由群众自办自管自养。因陋就简，就地取材，贯彻勤俭办学、勤工俭学、勤俭生产的方针。目前，已普及小学教育的地区，正在对新办学校进行巩固和提高。尚未实现普及小学教育的地区，群众办学运动仍在发展中。
