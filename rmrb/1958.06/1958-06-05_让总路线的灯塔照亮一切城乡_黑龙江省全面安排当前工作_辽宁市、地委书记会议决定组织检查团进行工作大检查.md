    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on the 2nd, deciding to comprehensively arrange current work in Heilongjiang Province based on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, adhering to the principle of "using the abstract to drive the concrete," so that the lighthouse of the general line of socialist construction shines on every city and village in the province, and deep into the minds of every cadre and person in the province, so that this political and ideological force immediately generates great material forces like atomic fission.

    The meeting decided to advance simultaneously on five broad fronts: Conducting more extensive propaganda and study of the general line of socialist construction throughout the province, carrying out rectification to the end; conducting major inspections of industry, agriculture, and all other work; vigorously promoting technological revolution and cultural revolution; making major adjustments to organizational structures to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward; and making major improvements in leadership style.

    Based on the principle of "using the abstract to drive the concrete," the meeting decided to first vigorously promote the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the general line of socialist construction within the province's party organizations and among the people of the province, dispatching propaganda teams with thousands of troops and horses, using various forms of propaganda and tools to ensure that every household knows about it, so that the vast number of cadres and the masses can achieve a great ideological liberation, boost their energy, and realize the fighting goals of a great leap forward in all tasks. In the major propaganda and study, it is required to relate to reality, inspect work, examine thinking, and summarize experience. Make people more deeply aware of the great significance of the general line of socialist construction in thought. Among cadres and the masses, it is also required to grasp some issues of universal significance and conduct great airing of views, great debates, and make the general line deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

    The meeting decided to launch a climax of theoretical study among party members and cadres throughout the province, especially requiring cadres above the standing committee of the county party committee to systematically study Chairman Mao's works, so that everyone can have a systematic understanding of the general line of socialist construction, and decided to cultivate and strengthen the Marxist-Leninist theoretical team in the province and start theoretical publications.

    The meeting demanded that the rectification movement throughout the province be carried out to the end, making the major propaganda and study of the general line closely integrated with rectification, so as to better attach importance to the leadership in the fourth stage of rectification. On the basis of learning, earnestly conduct inspection and self-reflection, further overcome "three winds" and "five airs," and improve everyone's ideological understanding. Never hastily end the war without achieving a complete victory in the rectification movement.

    The meeting decided to conduct a mass-line-based inspection of industry, agriculture, and all other work that combines leadership and the masses, discover typical examples, summarize experiences, discover problems, and solve problems, and effectively overcome the phenomenon of being rough rather than meticulous, superficial rather than deep, and showy rather than practical in some units' work. "This major inspection mainly takes the method of organizing inspection teams (which are also propaganda teams for the general line and working groups to help grassroots units) by the leading organs of the province, city, and county from top to bottom to conduct inspections; on the one hand, the method of mutual inspection, mutual learning, exchange of experience, and problem-solving between counties and counties, townships and townships, communes and communes, factories and factories is adopted, and the method of enterprise and internal inspection in the region and more extensive mobilization of the masses for major inspections is adopted."

    The meeting also demanded that, in order to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward, major adjustments should be made to organizational structures, urban and rural areas should be combined, power should be delegated, and provincial-level institutions should continue to be streamlined to enrich the lower levels and enrich the grassroots.

    Finally, the meeting decided to make major improvements in leadership style, requiring a great increase in the theoretical level of leading cadres in mastering materialist dialectics in the fourth stage of rectification. At the same time, it summarized and inspected the implementation of the experimental field system, and conducted four inspections and evaluations of various tasks throughout the year, requiring leading cadres to earnestly implement the system of going down for four months a year, approaching the masses more to exercise their thinking, increase their knowledge, and better implement the mass line.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China decided at the Provincial Municipal and Prefectural Party Committee Secretaries' Meeting held on May 30th and 31st to organize inspection teams in conjunction with the propaganda of the general line of socialist construction and the study of the content of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress to carry out a major inspection of rectification, production, and all aspects of work throughout the province, thereby deepening rectification and promoting a great leap forward in production and construction and all aspects of work.

    The meeting decided that throughout the province, it is necessary to immediately and vigorously, rapidly, universally, and deeply publicize, study, and implement the general line and the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, forming a magnificent mass movement, and through this movement, to liberate the minds of the entire party, all cadres, and all people, raise their understanding, deepen rectification, and promote the leap forward and another leap forward in production, construction, and various tasks. The meeting emphasized that every party member should regard publicizing the general line anytime and anywhere as their unshirkable obligation, and the general line must be correctly understood and grasped by all party cadres, and the general line should become the common thought, common consciousness, and common action guideline of the people of the province, making the general line a lighthouse guiding the province's progress in all aspects of work, so that the province will appear under the light of the general line a new situation of great ideological liberation and great work leap forward.
