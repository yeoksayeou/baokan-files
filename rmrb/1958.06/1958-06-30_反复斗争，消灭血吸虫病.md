Repeated Struggle to Eliminate Schistosomiasis

In the first five months of this year, a major victory was won in the work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis. The achievements made in five months have forced the "wait-and-see" faction to admit defeat. The facts tell us that eleven counties and cities in Anhui Province have basically eliminated snails, the schistosomiasis-affected areas in the province have basically managed excrement well, and the treatment of patients has also completed more than 40% of the target. Hunan Province expects to have treated all 200,000 patients discovered in the province by the end of June, and plans to further re-examine and treat recurrent patients. Zhejiang Province has treated more than 350,000 patients, reaching 58.3% of the original target of treating 600,000 people. It is particularly worth mentioning that Yujiang County in Jiangxi Province has eradicated schistosomiasis. According to the progress of advanced regions, it is highly possible to complete and exceed the annual plan this year. However, from the overall perspective, the progress among different regions varies, the grasp of various prevention and control measures varies, and there is still a large imbalance.

Eliminating schistosomiasis is an arduous task that involves changing the lives and production habits of millions of people. It is necessary to mobilize the masses, closely integrate with production, and conduct repeated struggles. There must be both mass-based shock campaigns and regular work. The two must be combined to fight tenaciously and continuously in order to quickly eliminate schistosomiasis. We must not be satisfied after winning a battle and stop moving forward. We must seize the opportunity, advance on the crest of victory, and fight to the end in one go. However, some comrades have different understandings of this issue, so their determination to prevent and control varies, and their enthusiasm also varies. This is the reason for the unevenness of the work.

The prevention and control of schistosomiasis cannot be stopped. In the winter and spring seasons, campaigns must be launched, and in the summer and autumn seasons, regular struggles must be insisted upon. According to the materials from the western suburbs of Shanghai, various effective snail eradication methods must be adopted and repeated more than seven times a year to basically eliminate snails. Only conducting one snail eradication campaign a year results in the number of snails eliminated being close to the number of snails growing; and in the summer and autumn seasons, snails are mostly on the surface of the land, reproducing the fastest, and snail eradication at this time is the most effective. This is also the peak season for fertilizer production, and if excrement management is not strict, the eggs will enter the water, which will increase the number of positive snails. Farmers also have more frequent opportunities to come into contact with water in their production and lives, and if personal protection is neglected, they will be infected with schistosomiasis. It can be seen that the prevention and control work in the summer and autumn seasons cannot be relaxed. The idea of "stopping the struggle in the summer and autumn seasons and waiting for a big effort in the autumn" will only cool down the enthusiasm of the masses for prevention and control work and will only benefit the reproduction of snails. Moreover, under the new situation of the great leap forward in production, summer and autumn have summer and autumn work, and winter and spring have winter and spring arrangements. Waiting for "slack farming" time to carry out prevention and control work is not an option. As long as it is combined with production, unified arrangements are made, and production gaps are seized, with unified labor organization in today's collectivization, prevention and control work in the summer and autumn seasons can still be carried out. In Hunan Province, May was the season for rice transplanting and the end of weeding, a tense season for draining waterlogging and preventing floods. They still persisted in treating more than 70,000 patients in this month. Fengcheng County in Jiangxi Province seized the gap between busy farming after rice transplanting to launch a shock snail eradication campaign, eliminating snails in paddy fields covering an area of more than 7,800 mu, treating more than 1,500 people, and accumulating 590,000 dan of fertilizer. This proves that prevention and control activities can be carried out during busy farming periods. This also proves that the principle of repeated struggles can be adhered to. Relying on a shock campaign to achieve immediate results in eliminating schistosomiasis, especially eliminating snails, is destined to fail.

Some people only use certain advanced indicators to calculate the time to complete the task. They say, "As long as we treat several hundred people a month, we can complete the task in one month." Therefore, they stand still and wait for the opportunity. They have not carefully considered that from prediction to realization, it is necessary to go through active and arduous efforts; otherwise, the prediction is only a prediction. Why not use all the time that can be used to lay a reliable foundation for completing the annual task, but place the hope on a battle in the autumn? The work of eliminating schistosomiasis must seize the opportunity and advance on the crest of victory. Otherwise, it will not be conducive to realizing the annual plan and will not be conducive to accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis. Repeated struggle is the objective law of eliminating schistosomiasis.

Yuijiang County in Jiangxi Province, after two years of repeated struggles, has already established the first banner of eradicating schistosomiasis in the country. Gucheng County in Hubei Province, after basically eliminating schistosomiasis, has also taken out greater enthusiasm to "cut mountains and fill rivers, move stones to fill lakes," completely eliminate snails, and eradicate schistosomiasis. With this ambition to persist in struggle and move mountains and fill seas, miracles unprecedented in history will surely be created. The comrades in Yuijiang County said it well: "Two years of hard work is better than a thousand years." That's right. In our era, the people's spirit is invigorated, and things that have never been thought of or done for thousands of years have been or will be realized by us. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the preface to the Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside: "What people used to think there was no way to deal with, now there is a way to deal with." Under the brilliant light of the general line, this spring, the people in the schistosomiasis-affected areas of the country, regardless of wind and rain, day and night, have invested in the struggle to eliminate the disease and have won an unprecedented victory. We should forge ahead bravely. As long as there are three or four shock campaigns a year, plus regular work, the country will continue to see a second, a third, and even dozens or hundreds of Yuijiang counties.

The first half of the year has passed. The past work proves that where the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is implemented, the work there is advanced. The conditions in Hunan Province are not the best, and the difficulties encountered by other regions have also been encountered by them. However, their focus is not only on seeing the difficulties, but on mobilizing all positive factors, letting go of mobilizing the masses, daring to think and act, and boldly innovating technology. Therefore, they were able to treat 120,000 people, eliminate snails in more than 400 million square meters, and manage the excrement of villages that have reached 74.3% of the villages that should be managed in the first half of the year, and have created a high record of a three-person treatment team treating 3,415 people per month and a stool examination team examining 2,616 people per day. This makes it possible for them to complete their tasks ahead of schedule and exceed the target. Compared with other regions with small epidemic areas, few patients, and strong technical forces, but lagging behind, it clearly illustrates the truth that "everything depends on human effort." As long as the mind is liberated, dare to act, forge ahead bravely, the already backward areas can catch up with the advanced areas and surpass them. The advanced areas in the first half of the year, in order to continue to maintain their lead, must not be complacent, but must go further, make persistent efforts, and fight to the end.

To do a good job in the second half of the year, we should immediately conduct in-depth and detailed inspection work, and summarize experience and discover problems through inspection. "Look at the next step from the previous step, look at next year from this year." This is an important leadership method. The experience and problems of the previous step are the direction and lessons of the next step. In the first half of the year, some areas relaxed the eradication of snails and the management of excrement, and in the second half of the year, they should further implement comprehensive measures and make up for what is lacking. According to the spirit of continuous revolution, when a task is about to be completed, new tasks should be proposed, so that the prevention and control work can be vigorously pushed to the final victory in one upsurge after another.

Under the brilliant light of the general line, industrial and agricultural production and all construction undertakings such as culture, education, and health will move towards new great victories. Under the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, eliminating schistosomiasis has a more urgent and important significance. This is an important measure to protect people's health, rescue labor, and promote agricultural production in epidemic areas. Moreover, this year is the second year of the four-year battle, and this year's battle is of decisive significance to the entire movement, and we must do everything possible to ensure the realization of the annual plan. We must, with the spirit of overcoming obstacles, go all out, aim high, and achieve the annual plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and fight to accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis!

### 反复斗争，消灭血吸虫病

    反复斗争，消灭血吸虫病
    今年头五个月，在防治血吸虫病工作上，打了一个大胜仗。五个月取得的成绩，使观潮派不得不认输了。事实告诉我们：安徽省已有十一个县市基本消灭钉螺，全省血吸虫病流行区基本管好粪便，治疗病人也完成指标的40％以上。湖南省预计在6月底可将全省已发现的二十万病人治疗一遍，并计划进一步复查和治疗复发病人。浙江省收治了三十五万余名病人，达到原订治疗六十万人指标的58.3％。值得特别提出的是，江西省余江县已经根除了血吸虫病。按照先进地区的进度，完成和超额完成今年全年规划是有很大的可能的。但从全部来看，各地区之间进度有快有慢，对各项防治措施抓得有松有紧，还存在着很大的不平衡。
    消灭血吸虫病是一场关系到改变千百万群众生活、生产习惯的艰巨任务，必须发动群众，紧密结合生产，进行反复斗争。既要有群众性的突击运动，也要有经常工作，必须把两者结合起来，顽强地、不断地进行战斗，才能迅速的消灭血吸虫病。决不能在打了一个胜仗之后，就心满意足，停兵不前。必须掌握时机，乘胜前进，一鼓作气地战斗到底。但是还有些同志对于这个问题有不同的认识，因而对防治工作的决心就有坚与不坚之分，干劲也有足与不足之别。这就是工作不平衡的原因。
    血吸虫病的防治工作是不能停顿的。冬春季节要开展运动，夏秋季节也要坚持经常的斗争。根据上海市西郊区的材料，一年之内，采取各种有效的灭螺方法，反复进行七次以上，才可以把钉螺基本消灭。一年只搞一次灭螺运动，消灭的钉螺与生长的钉螺数字相近；而夏秋季节钉螺大都在土地的表面，繁殖最快，这个时候灭螺收效最大。这时又正是生产用肥的紧张季节，如果粪便管理不严，虫卵下水，就会使阳性钉螺增多。农民生产和生活中接触水的机会也较频繁，忽视了个人防护，就会感染血吸虫病。由此可见，夏秋季节的防治工作是不能放松的。“夏秋季节停止斗争，等秋后再大干”的思想，只会使群众防治工作的热情冷却，只利于钉螺的繁殖。何况在生产大跃进的新形势下，夏秋有夏秋的工作，冬春有冬春的安排，防治工作专等“农闲”时间再搞，是等不到的。只要和生产结合起来，统一安排，抓住生产空隙，在合作化了的今天，劳力有了统一的组织，夏秋季节的防治工作还是可以进行的。湖南省5月份正是插秧扫尾、紧张的排渍防汛季节，他们还坚持在这个月内治疗了七万多病人。江西省丰城县抓住插秧后农忙的间隙时间，开展了一次突击灭螺运动，在七千八百多亩的面积的水田内消灭了钉螺，治疗一千五百多人，还积肥五十九万担。这都证明农忙期间利用空隙是可以开展防治活动的。这也证明反复斗争的原则是可以坚持的。把消灭血吸虫病，特别是消灭钉螺，寄托在一次突击运动，一举奏效的想法，是注定要落空的。
    有些人只凭某些先进指标去计算完成任务的时间，他们说：“只要按一个月治几百人的指标，我们干一个月就可以完成任务”，因此，按兵不动，坐待时机。他们没有仔细考虑，从预计到实现，还需要经过积极艰苦的努力，否则，预计只不过是预计。为什么不利用一切可以利用的时间，为完成全年任务打下可靠的基础，偏要把希望寄托于秋后一战呢？消灭血吸虫病工作，必须抓紧时机，乘胜前进。否则，就不利于实现全年规划，不利于加速消灭血吸虫病。反复斗争是消灭血吸虫病的客观规律。
    江西省余江县经过两年来的反复斗争，已经在全国树立起第一面根除血吸虫病的旗帜。湖北省谷城县也在基本消灭血吸虫病之后，又拿出更大的干劲，要“削山填河，移石补湖”，彻底消灭钉螺，根除血吸虫病。有这种坚持斗争、移山填海的壮志，一定会创造出史无前例的奇迹。余江县的同志说得好：“苦战二年胜千古”。不错，在我们时代，人民精神焕发，千古不曾想到、做到的事情，已经被我们实现或将要实现。毛泽东同志在中国农村的社会主义高潮的序言中说：“过去人们认为没有办法对付的，现在也有办法对付了”。在总路线的光辉照耀下，今年春天全国血吸虫病流行区的人民，不顾风雨，不分昼夜，投入了消灭疾病的斗争，已经获得一个空前的胜利。我们正应该奋勇前进，只要一年来个三、四次突击运动，再加上经常工作，全国将要继续不断的出现第二个、第三个以至几十个上百个余江县。
    上半年的时间已经过去了。过去的工作证明：哪里贯彻执行了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，哪里的工作就先进。湖南省的条件不是最好的，别的地区遇到的困难，他们也曾遇到，但是，他们的目光不只是看到困难，而是调动一切积极因素，放手发动群众，敢想敢为，大胆革新技术，因而他们能在上半年内治疗了十二万人，灭螺四亿多平方公尺，管理好粪便的乡已达到应管乡的74.3％，而且创造了三人治疗小组月治三千四百十五人，粪便检查日检二千六百十六人次的高记录。这就使他们的任务有了提前和超额完成的可能。这与另外一些流行面积不大，病人不多，技术力量较强，而迟迟不前的地区比较起来，明显地说明“事在人为”的真理。只要思想解放了，敢作敢为，奋勇前进，已经落后了的地区也可以赶上先进地区，并超过他们。上半年的先进地区，要想继续保持先进，决不能自满，还要百尺竿头更进一步，再接再厉地战斗到底。
    要做好下半年的工作，应该马上进行深入的、细致的检查工作，通过检查总结经验，发现问题。“上步看下步，今年看明年”，这是一个重要的领导方法。上步的经验和问题，就是下步的方向和教训。上半年有些地区，放松了灭钉螺和管理粪便，下半年就应该进一步贯彻执行综合措施，缺什么，补什么。根据不断革命的精神，在一个任务将要完成的时候，就要提出新的任务来，这样，就能朝气蓬勃地使一个高潮接着一个高潮地把防治工作推向最后的胜利。
    在总路线光辉的照耀下，工农业生产和文教卫生等一切建设事业，将走向新的伟大的胜利。在农业生产大跃进的新形势下，消灭血吸虫病就有着更加迫切的重要意义。这是保护人民健康，抢救劳动力，促进疫区农业增产的一项重要措施。而且，今年又是四年战斗的第二年，今年这一仗对整个运动是有决定意义的，必须千方百计地保证全年规划的实现。我们要以披荆斩棘的精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地实现全年规划，为加速消灭血吸虫病而斗争！
