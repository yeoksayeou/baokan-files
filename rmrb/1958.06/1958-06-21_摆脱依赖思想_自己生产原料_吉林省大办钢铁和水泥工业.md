Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th: Jilin Province's industrial departments are getting rid of their dependence in industrial construction and are vigorously developing major industries such as steel and cement to establish their own raw material supply base.

This year, local industry in Jilin Province has developed rapidly. The supply of raw materials is tight, posing a serious problem for the development of local industry throughout the province: should they continue to rely on assistance from the state and brotherly provinces, or should they overcome difficulties on their own? In the past, there was not a single steel plant in the province, and all the steel used each year was transferred from outside. As a result, some people developed a mentality of dependence, reaching out to the state for help whenever they needed it; others, at the mention of steelmaking and ironmaking, immediately thought of Anshan Iron and Steel, believing they "couldn't touch it." Recently, after some people learned from the experience of other places using indigenous methods to make iron, they established confidence in building a metallurgical industry. However, another group of people felt that this kind of industry was "nothing special" and wanted to only build modern large-scale factories, divorced from the actual conditions. These incorrect views were thoroughly criticized at the recent provincial metallurgical conference. The conference affirmed the policy of fully utilizing the province's resources, overcoming difficulties on their own, and boldly establishing raw material industries. At the same time, it emphasized that it is necessary to adopt a method of first using indigenous methods then foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously developing small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces with small investments, rapid construction, and simple equipment to solve the current urgent need for steel. From June to September, 133 small blast furnaces, 281 indigenous blast furnaces, and some steelmaking and rolling equipment will be put into production one after another throughout the province. The ironmaking capacity of these blast furnaces will reach more than 400,000 tons per year. This year, they will produce 100,000 tons of pig iron, 10,000 tons of steel ingots, and 5,000 tons of steel. At the same time, Jilin Province is also preparing to build a medium-sized iron and steel and nitrogen fertilizer joint enterprise in Tonghua City. This is the backbone of the province's steel industry.

Jilin Province does not produce cement. Now, the province is catching up and developing the cement industry. In addition to restoring a medium-sized cement factory with an annual output of 300,000 tons, fourteen cities and counties are preparing to build a batch of small factories using indigenous methods to produce low-grade cement.

### 摆脱依赖思想　自己生产原料  吉林省大办钢铁和水泥工业

    摆脱依赖思想　自己生产原料
    吉林省大办钢铁和水泥工业
    据新华社长春20日电　吉林省工业部门正在摆脱工业建设中的依赖思想，大办钢铁、水泥等主要工业，以建立本省原材料供应基地。
    今年吉林省地方工业发展很快。原材料的供应呈现紧张，使全省地方工业的发展面对着一个严重问题：继续依赖国家和兄弟省份的援助呢，还是自己动手克服困难。过去省内没有一个钢铁厂，每年所用的钢铁都由外面调进。有些人因此养成了依赖思想，用时就伸手向国家要；另有些人一提到炼钢炼铁，就马上想到鞍钢，认为自己“摸不得”。最近，有些人学习了外地用土法炼铁的经验后，树立了建立冶金工业的信心，但是另外有一部分人又认为这种工业“没有什么”，想脱离现实条件只办现代化的大厂。这些不正确的看法在最近召开的全省冶金会议上，受到彻底批判。会议肯定了充分利用本省资源，自己动手克服困难，大胆创办原材料工业的方针。同时强调指出，必须采取先土后洋、土洋结合的办法，大力发展投资小、建设快、设备简单的小高炉和土高炉，以解决目前对钢铁的急需。从6月到9月，全省将有一百三十三座小高炉、二百八十一座土高炉和部分炼钢、轧钢设备陆续投入生产。这些高炉每年的炼铁能力达四十万吨以上。今年就将出产十万吨生铁、一万吨钢锭、五千吨钢材。同时，吉林省还正在通化市筹建一座中型钢铁、氮肥联合企业。这是全省钢铁工业的骨干。
    吉林省不产水泥，现在，全省正急起直追，发展水泥工业。除正在恢复一座年产三十万吨的中型水泥工厂外，有十四个市县正在筹建一批用土法生产低标号水泥小型厂。
