    Glass Tube Battery
    The Shijiazhuang Battery Production Cooperative has recently successfully trial-produced a glass tube battery. This battery has a discharge time of up to nineteen hours, which is two hours longer than a zinc cylinder battery, and the battery's moisture resistance is also stronger than that of a zinc cylinder.
    According to preliminary calculations by the cooperative, using glass tubes instead of zinc plates can save about 3,000 jin of zinc plates and about 300 jin of solder per 10,000 dozen batteries. The cost of the battery can also be reduced by 25%. (Zai Zhi)

    玻璃管电池
    石家庄市电池生产合作社最近试制成功了一种玻璃管电池。这种电池放电时间达十九小时，比锌筒电池多放电两个小时，电池的防潮力也比锌筒强。
    据这个社初步计算，用玻璃管代替锌板，每万打电池即可节约锌板三千斤和焊锡三百斤左右。电池的成本也可降低25％。（载之）
