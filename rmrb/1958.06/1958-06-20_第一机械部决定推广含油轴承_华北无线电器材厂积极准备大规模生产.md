Xinhua News Agency, 19th - An important new product that can replace ball bearings in many ways—oil-impregnated bearings—has recently been successfully trial-produced at the North China Radio Equipment Factory. The successful trial production of oil-impregnated bearings will play a significant role in solving the current shortage of ball bearings during the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in our country; manufacturing this type of bearing can also save a large amount of steel. The First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to widely promote this new technology throughout the country.

This oil-impregnated bearing is made by grinding steel rolling waste (iron oxide scale) into powder, mixing it with graphite, and then pressing, forming, sintering, oil-impregnating, and grinding it. It itself forms a porous sponge body. After being oil-impregnated, it can absorb oil, hence the name oil-impregnated bearing, also called "iron-graphite oil-impregnated bearing."

Although the strength of oil-impregnated bearings is lower than that of ball bearings, they are very suitable for certain urban and rural transportation vehicles and power machinery, general agricultural machinery, and small and medium-sized machinery in local industries. The oil-impregnated bearings trial-produced by this factory can replace twenty-five different specifications of ball bearings and bronze bearings. They are now being tested in motors, motorcycles, bicycles, and automobiles.

This type of bearing has many advantages: first, the production process is simple and the cost is low. Buying one ton of iron oxide scale only costs five yuan, and making a set of oil-impregnated bearings with this iron oxide scale only costs 0.3 to 0.7 yuan. The cost can be greatly reduced when mass-produced. However, a ball bearing of the same specification costs three to four yuan per set.

Secondly, it saves the trouble of refueling and has strong wear resistance. Because the oil-impregnated bearing itself contains oil, when the bearing is subjected to rotational force, the oil will automatically secrete and lubricate. It is more suitable for some machines with smaller loads and inconvenient refueling.

Building a factory for producing such oil-impregnated bearings requires less investment and yields quick results. An investment of one million yuan can build a factory with an annual output of 15 million sets of oil-impregnated bearings. The profits obtained within a few months can recover the entire investment.

The North China Radio Equipment Factory is preparing for mass production of this type of bearing.

### 第一机械部决定推广含油轴承  华北无线电器材厂积极准备大规模生产

    第一机械部决定推广含油轴承
    华北无线电器材厂积极准备大规模生产
    新华社19日讯　一种可以多方面代替滚珠轴承的重要新产品——含油轴承，最近已在华北无线电器材厂试制成功。含油轴承的试制成功，对解决我国目前工农业大跃进时期滚珠轴承供不应求的情况，将起很大作用；制造这种轴承还可以节省大量钢材。第一机械工业部已决定在全国各地广泛推广这种新技术。
    这种含油轴承是把轧钢的废料（氧化铁皮）磨成粉末，和石墨混在一起，经过压制、成形、烧结、浸油、研磨而制成的。它本身形成一种多孔的海绵体，经浸油后，就可以吸住油，所以叫含油轴承，也叫“铁石墨含油轴承”。
    含油轴承强度虽较滚珠轴承低，但对城乡某些运输工具和动力机械，一般农业机械及地方工业中小型机械都很适用。这个厂试制的含油轴承，可以代替二十五种不同规格的滚珠轴承和青铜轴承。现在已经在电机、摩托车、自行车、汽车等方面试用。
    这种轴承优点很多：首先是制作过程简单，成本低廉。买一吨氧化铁皮只需五元钱，用这些氧化铁皮制一套含油轴承只需三角到七角钱，大批生产时成本还可大大降低。但同样规格的滚珠轴承每套就需要三、四元钱。
    其次，节省加油手续，耐磨性强，因为含油轴承本身含油，当轴承受到转动作用时，油就会自动分泌出来，起润滑作用，它对一些负荷较小加油不方便的机器更为适用。
    建设这种含油轴承的工厂，投资少，收效快，投资一百万元，可建一座年产一千五百万套的含油轴承的工厂。几个月内所得利润就可把全部投资收回。
    华北无线电器材厂正在准备大规模生产这种轴承。
