Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 21st: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote a letter to the Chairman of the International Commission on the 14th regarding the International Commission's decision to allow the South Vietnamese regime to "replace" weapons that the French Expeditionary Corps took with them when withdrawing from South Vietnam.

In the letter, Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army believes that this is a resolution that violates the Geneva Accords and is detrimental to peace. Vo Nguyen Giap said that therefore, "shipping new weapons and war materials into South Vietnam to replace the weapons and war materials taken away by the French Expeditionary Corps when withdrawing from Vietnam violates Article 17 of the Geneva Accords, Protocol No. 23 of the Central Joint Commission, and the resolutions in the International Commission's letter of October 15, 1956."

Vo Nguyen Giap said that, in addition, Article 10 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also stipulates that France will withdraw its troops from the territories of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia for a period of time after peace is restored. It is obvious that it is perfectly natural for the French Expeditionary Corps, as the invading army that created the Indochina War, to withdraw completely from Vietnamese territory after the restoration of peace. Therefore, the issue of shipping new weapons and war materials into Vietnam cannot be raised under the pretext of replacing the weapons taken away by this army when it withdrew from Vietnam.

Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that for several years, under the direction of the United States, the Southern regime has been violating and is violating important provisions of the Geneva Accords. Under these circumstances, the above-mentioned resolution of the International Commission will create conditions for the Southern regime to legalize the act of illegally shipping in weapons and will pave the way for foreign countries to strengthen military intervention in South Vietnam, turn the South into a military base, and prepare for the conspiracy to re-ignite the war.

Vo Nguyen Giap concluded by writing that, based on the above-mentioned legal and political reasons for safeguarding the Geneva Accords, for the Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification, and for the interests of peace in Southeast Asia and the world, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army requests the International Commission: First, to postpone the implementation of the above-mentioned resolution while awaiting the opinions of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference; Second, to take active measures to require the Southern regime to stop reinforcing Vietnam with all new weapons and war materials, and to ensure that the International Commission effectively carries out monitoring and supervision in the South.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 22nd: Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, said that the Polish delegation of the International Commission believes that the International Commission's decision to allow the South Vietnamese authorities to "replace" the weapons that the French Expeditionary Corps took with them when withdrawing from South Vietnam is not in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the military provisions of the Geneva Accords.

Ha Van Lau made this statement at a press conference on the afternoon of the 21st when announcing that General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, had written a letter to the Chairman of the International Commission on June 14 regarding the International Commission's aforementioned decision.

    武元甲将军指出南越不得“替换”武器
    越南国际委会的决定违反日内瓦协议
    波兰代表团也认为这个决定同日内瓦协议相抵触
    据新华社河内21日电  越南人民军总司令武元甲大将14日曾就越南国际委员会决定允许越南南方政权“替换”法国远征军在撤离越南南方时带走的武器的问题写信给国际委员会主席。
    武元甲在信中指出，越南人民军总司令部认为，这是一个违反日内瓦协议、不利于和平的决议。武元甲说，因此，“向越南南方运入新的武器和作战物资来替换法国远征军撤离越南时所带走的武器和作战物资，是违反日内瓦协议第十七条和中央联合委员会第二十三号议定书以及国际委员会1956年10月15日公函中的决议的”。
    武元甲说，另外，日内瓦协议还在会议的最后宣言第十条中规定，在和平恢复以后的一个时期内，法国将从越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国领土上撤退其军队。很明显，作为制造印度支那战争的侵略军队的法国远征军，在和平恢复以后全部从越南领土上撤退是非常自然的事。因此，就不能以替换这支军队在撤离越南时所带走的武器为借口来提出向越南运入新的武器和作战物资的问题。
    武元甲指出，几年来，南方政权在美国的指使下，已经和正在违反日内瓦协议的重要条款。在这种情况下，国际委员会的上述决议将为南方政权创造条件，使他们可能利用这个决议来把非法运入武器行为合法化，并且将为外国加强对南越的军事干涉、把南方变为军事基地、准备重新掀起战争的阴谋开辟道路。
    武元甲最后写道，根据上述为了维护日内瓦协议、为了越南人民的和平统一愿望、为了东南亚和世界和平的利益等法理上和政治上的理由，越南人民军总司令部要求国际委员会：一、在等待日内瓦会议两位主席的意见期间，缓期执行上述决议；二、采取积极措施，要求南方政权停止向越南增援一切新的武器和作战物资，保证国际委员会在南方有效地进行监察和监督。
    据新华社河内22日电  越南人民军联络代表团团长何文楼上校说，国际委员会的波兰代表团认为，国际委员会作出允许越南南方当局“替换”法国远征军从南越撤离时带走的武器的决定，是不符合日内瓦协议军事条款第十七条的规定的。
    何文楼是在21日下午的记者招待会上宣布越南人民军总司令武元甲大将已经在6月14日就国际委员会的上述决定写信给国际委员会主席时谈到波兰代表团这一意见。
