    In Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, located 1,500 to 1,800 meters above sea level beyond the Great Wall, bamboo shoots have emerged from the bamboo planted this year, reaching several inches in length. These 900 bamboo plants were transplanted this spring from Tai'an County, Shandong Province, and were planted in the Zhangbei Forest Farm and the Zhangbei County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
