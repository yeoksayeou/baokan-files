    When Installing Blowers
    By Our Reporter Feng Jian

    The factory building of the No. 1 blast furnace steam blower station in Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant is brightly lit at night. The clanging sound rushes out from the windows, flying towards the construction site, and mingling with the whistling of the wind shovels on the blast furnace, deafening to the ears.

    Two of China's largest blowers are being installed here. Although only four of the dozens of installation workers have done this kind of installation work before, they are creating a miracle: the blowers are twice as large as those in Anshan Iron and Steel, but the number of installation workers is half that of Anshan; the speed will exceed Anshan, with two units installed simultaneously in four months, creating a national record.

    The installation of these two blowers began on April 1 and is scheduled to be completed on August 1. The workers' soaring enthusiasm and heroic spirit have become a model for the leap forward on the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site. However, two months ago, before the blowers were installed, a small storm occurred here.

    At that time, the good news of the Great Leap Forward swept across the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site with the spring breeze. The No. 1 blast furnace construction site was bustling with people and horses, tense and extraordinary. One day, the hoisting machine station sent a challenge letter to the blower station. The fitters installing the blowers discussed it and accepted the challenge. They guaranteed that two groups of fitters would install the two blowers in five months, delivering air to the blast furnace. The fitters excitedly told the foreman, Chen Futang, about this, but unexpectedly, Foreman Chen frowned and said coldly, "Good! Let's discuss it first," and then strode off to find the Party Branch Secretary, Wang Changyu.

    Chen Futang is a Communist Party member. Before coming to the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site, he was a well-known foreman in Hu Zhaosen's work section at Anshan Iron and Steel. Hu Zhaosen's work section had installed more than a dozen blowers in Anshan Iron and Steel, creating many new national records, and became a nationally renowned advanced youth work section. A large red banner with golden tassels was permanently hung in the section. Originally, Chen Futang and his work section planned to send four groups of fitters to complete the two blowers in five months. Because the workers could not be transferred, the matter was still pending. Chen Futang was already very anxious. Now, hearing that two groups of fitters would complete two units simultaneously in five months, much faster than the highest record of Hu Zhaosen's work section, he felt even more uneasy. He rushed to the Party Branch and asked Wang Changyu with a bellyful of grievances: "They only know how to rush the construction period, and don't care about the difficulties. Who will be responsible if the task is not completed in the future?"

    Wang Changyu, seeing Chen Futang like this, felt both amused and angry, and asked him in return: "In your opinion, what are the difficulties?" Chen Futang listed three major difficulties in one breath: first, there are too few workers and their technical level is too low, not enough; second, the factory site is narrow, and two units cannot be worked on at the same time; third, there is only one crane, and two units installed simultaneously will cause conflicts. Finally, he added with particular emphasis: "If the workers can solve these three problems, I will support it; if they can't solve it - then simply follow the old plan."

    In fact, the three major difficulties Chen Futang mentioned were all true. However, Wang Changyu understood Chen Futang's concerns. In Hu Zhaosen's work section in Anshan Iron and Steel, honor and praise always followed him; since coming to the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site from the Northeast, he has often spurred himself on to do even better, so as not to lose the face of the advanced work section. It is precisely because of this that he sometimes even fears difficulties and avoids them. Today, the No. 1 blast furnace needs the blower to deliver air ahead of schedule, and the installation has encountered difficulties. Can sticking to the old ways and shrinking back preserve past honors? Thinking of this, Wang Changyu said to Chen Futang: "There are indeed many difficulties, but as the foreman, you should lead by example and work with everyone to find ways to overcome the difficulties, and not pour cold water on everyone." After Chen Futang left, he immediately notified a mass meeting of the entire work section, mobilizing everyone to discuss the matter.

    The mass meeting was held after dinner. Chen Futang raised the three major difficulties again at the meeting. However, as soon as he finished speaking, the workers began to discuss.

    Fitter team leader Liu Zhenfu had worked with Chen Futang in Anshan Iron and Steel. He was the first to stand up and say: "Foreman Chen said that there are not enough people, this is using the old calendar, and has not taken into account the revolutionary enthusiasm of our workers." Before he finished speaking, another fitter, Ma Jie, interjected: "It doesn't matter if there are few people. When we are busy, we will carry our luggage to the construction site to live, and work day and night continuously, and that will be enough." Meng Qingtang, an old scaffolder in his fifties, also jokingly added: "Good, good, move to the construction site to live, so that we can exert our strength. This old man of mine is not one to hold back, you young lads, you have to weigh it up." Master Meng's happy appearance made everyone laugh and say in unison: "Good, good, move to the construction site to work."

    Everyone chimed in, each sentence touched Chen Futang's heart. Especially Ma Jie, who used to like to play pranks and tell strange stories from Anshan to Lanzhou, and others would squint at him. Chen Futang never expected him to become so active today. Chen Futang's heart was warm, but he was still undecided and somewhat doubtful. Just as he was thinking, the words of the old scaffolder Meng Qingtang interrupted his thoughts.

    "Foreman Chen is worried about the narrow site, this problem is also easy to solve." Meng Qingtang said: "Open up a pre-assembly yard downstairs in the blower station factory building, pre-assemble first, then hoist, and that will be fine." Several other workers added: Build a temporary shed outside the factory building to clean small machine parts; in this way, upstairs and downstairs, inside and outside the factory can work together, which can avoid on-site congestion.

    Two major difficulties had been solved easily. At this time, only Chen Futang's third problem remained: one crane, two teams using it at the same time, would there really be conflicts?

    "There will be no conflicts at all," Liu Zhenfu said, looking at another fitter team leader, Guo Hongru, "Our two teams can work in shifts, without stopping the work or the machines. Lao Guo and I will take turns using the crane. They use it during the day, and we use it at night; they use it at night, and we use it during the day. Do you think it's okay, Lao Guo?" Guo Hongru quickly replied with a smile: "Don't mention it, it's like brothers working, there's nothing to argue about."

    Chen Futang listened, his face flushed. Why didn't he, as the foreman, think of these seemingly simple principles? Now, he realized that he didn't really understand the workers. In the past, when he worked with the workers in Anshan Iron and Steel to create new records, he saw how profound the workers' experience and wisdom were, but it was far from the feeling he had today. The more he listened, the more ashamed he felt, and the more excited he became. The workers' bold and generous speeches made his heart suddenly clear. Those days in Anshan Iron and Steel, the past events of installing blower after blower, were churning in his mind one scene after another. He suddenly thought of a way to speed up the installation. However, he did not say it immediately, but deliberately asked: "Everyone consider again, can two blowers be installed in four months?"

    Everyone was stunned by this sudden question. Dozens of pairs of eyes stared at the fitter team leader Liu Zhenfu - he was calculating with his head down. Liu Zhenfu thought, three months for installation, one month for adjustment and trial run, it may be a bit tight, but it's about the same... With eight or nine points of certainty, Liu Zhenfu stood up and said: "Everyone work harder, we can finish it in four months!"

    The meeting place suddenly became lively. Scaffolders, riveters, welders, fitters, each one looked happy and eager to try. Only the pipe fitters looked at each other, worried. Xie Dexiang, the pipe fitter team leader, said that according to the old rules, the pipe fitters' work must always follow behind the fitters. Only after the fitters have installed the main body of the blower can the pipe fitters enter the site. At that time, there will only be a month or so left, and with all the skills in the world, they will not be able to install the pipes for two blowers.

    As soon as this was said, the meeting place was in chaos again. Some said that it seemed that it was necessary to increase the number of workers; some advocated extending the construction period. There were many opinions, and no one could agree. At this time, Chen Futang slowly said his plan.

    "I have an idea that guarantees that two blowers will be installed and handed over in four months." Chen Futang said confidently: "We will break the old rules of installing blowers in the past, reverse the installation sequence, first install the auxiliary equipment of the turbine and blower, and then install their main body. This will allow the pipe fitters to enter the site in advance and carry out parallel construction with other types of work, which is equivalent to earning two or three months of time. However, since the conventional methods have been broken, we must simultaneously adopt a strict layer-by-layer inspection system to ensure the quality of the project."

    The workers listened to Chen Futang in silence at first, and then cheered and rejoiced: "Good, good, we will hand it over on 'August 1'!" "We will resolutely guarantee excellent quality!"...

    Now, the installation of the two blowers is going smoothly, and the workers' plan is likely to be realized ahead of schedule. Most of them have moved to live next to the blower, and the Party Branch Secretary often has to urge them to go to sleep at night. Chen Futang and the workers all have a great ambition to compete with Hu Zhaosen's work section for the advanced youth work section in this installation.

    After the storm of the debate passed, Chen Futang went to Party Branch Secretary Wang Changyu to talk. He said: "Finding the masses to discuss matters, there really are no problems that cannot be solved. The workers' wisdom is so great, and their enthusiasm is so strong, why should we be afraid of not being able to surpass Hu Zhaosen's work section in Anshan Iron and Steel?"

    安装鼓风机的时候
    本报记者  冯健
    武钢一号高炉蒸汽鼓风机站的厂房，入夜电灯烁亮。铿锵的响声，从窗子里冲出来，朝着工地飞扬，和高炉上风铲哒哒的啸叫交融在一起，震耳欲聋。
    这里正在安装两台我国最大的鼓风机。虽说几十个安装工人当中，只有四个人干过这种安装活，但是，他们正在创造一个奇迹：鼓风机比鞍钢的大两倍，安装工人比鞍钢却少二分之一；速度要超过鞍钢，四个月同时安好两台，创造全国最高纪录。
    这两台鼓风机是从4月1日开始安装的，计划在8月1日竣工。工人们冲天的干劲，豪迈的气概，已经成为武钢工地向前跃进的一个榜样。但是，在两个月前，当鼓风机还没有开始安装的时候，这里却发生过一次小小的风波。
    那时候，大跃进的喜讯随着春风吹遍了武钢工地。一号高炉工地上，人喊马嘶，紧张非凡。一天，卷扬机站给鼓风机站送来了一份挑战书。安装鼓风机的钳工们合计了一下，应战了。他们保证：两组钳工，五个月把两台鼓风机安装好，向高炉送风。钳工们兴冲冲地把这件事告诉了工长陈福堂，没料到，陈工长把脸一沉，只冷冷地说了声：“好啊！讨论讨论再说吧”，就拔腿找党支部书记王长余去了。
    陈福堂是共产党员，来武钢工地以前，他是鞍钢赫赫有名的胡兆森工段的一个工长。胡兆森工段在鞍钢安装过十几台鼓风机，创造过多次全国新纪录，成了全国闻名的先进青年工段。段里常年挂着镶有金色丝穗的大红奖旗。这次的两台鼓风机，陈福堂他们工段本来打算调四组钳工，五个月安完，因为工人调不来，问题还悬着，陈福堂已经十分焦急，现在听说两组钳工五个月就要同时安完两台，比胡兆森工段的最高纪录还快很多，心里越发不安起来。他急匆匆地跑到党支部，满肚子怨气地问王长余：“他们只知道赶工期，也不管有多少困难，将来完不成任务谁负责？”
    王长余看陈福堂这样，又好气、又好笑，就反过来问了一句：“依你看，都有什么困难？”陈福堂一口气举出了三大困难：第一、工人少，技术级别又低，不够用；第二、厂房场地狭窄，两台不能一齐干；第三、天车只有一台，两台同时安装，就要打架。最后，特别加重语气说：“要是工人们把这三个问题解决了，我赞成干；要是解决不了嘛——干脆，照老计划干。”
    说实在话，陈福堂说的这三大困难都是事实。但是，王长余了解陈福堂的心事。在鞍钢胡兆森工段的时候，荣誉、夸奖老跟着他；从东北来到武钢工地，他还常常鞭策自己要干得更漂亮点，不要丢了先进工段的脸。正是因为这个缘故，他有时候甚至已经有点害怕困难，逃避困难。今天，一号高炉需要鼓风机提前送风，安装遇到了困难，难道墨守陈规、畏缩不前，就能保住过去的荣誉吗？王长余想到这里，对陈福堂说：“困难确是不少，可你当工段长的，应该以身作则，跟大家一起想办法克服困难，不能往大家头上泼冷水。”陈福堂走后，他马上通知召开全工段群众大会，发动大家来讨论这件事。
    群众大会在晚饭后开了。陈福堂在会上又提出了那三大困难。但是，他的话刚刚落音，工人们就议论开了。
    钳工组长刘振富，跟陈福堂一起在鞍钢工作过。他第一个站起来说：“陈工长说人手不够，这是用老皇历办事，没有把咱们工人的革命干劲算进去，”话还未了，另一个钳工马杰就插进来说：“人少不要紧，忙的时候，我们把行李扛到工地来住，白天黑夜连着干，这不就得了。”五十多岁的老架子工孟庆堂，也紧接着打趣说：“好哇，都搬到工地来住，才能使上劲哩。我这老头子，是没有拖后腿的人啦，你们年轻小伙子，可要掂量掂量啦。”孟师傅喜眯眯的那副相，逗得大家都笑起来，齐声说：“好，好，搬到工地来干哪。”
    大家你一言我一语，句句打动陈福堂的心。特别是马杰，过去从鞍山到兰州，总爱调皮讲怪话，别人都斜着眼瞅他。今天变得这样积极，陈福堂一点也没想到。陈福堂心里热呼呼的，可是还拿不定主意，有些怀疑，正想着，老架子工孟庆堂的话打断了他的思绪。
    “陈工长耽心场地狭小，这问题也好办。”孟庆堂说：“在鼓风机站厂房楼下，开拓一个预拼场，先拼装，再吊装，就行了”。另外几个工人接着说：再在厂房外边搭一个临时工棚，清洗小机件；这样楼上楼下，厂内厂外一齐干，能避免现场拥挤。
    两大困难已经迎刃而解，这时，只剩下陈福堂的第三个难题：一部天车，两个组同时使用，到底会不会打架呢？
    “根本不会打架，”刘振富一边看着另一个钳工组长郭洪儒，一边说：“我们两个组可以倒班干，歇人不歇马，我跟老郭轮流使唤天车，他们白天用，我们就晚上用；他们晚上用，我们就白天用。你说行吗，老郭？”郭洪儒连忙笑着答道：“甭提了，就像哥俩干活，没有不好说的。”
    陈福堂听着，脸上一阵阵发热。这些看来简单的道理，为什么自己当工长的就没想到？到现在，他才发觉自己对工人并不算真正了解。过去，在鞍钢跟工人们一起创造新纪录的时候，他亲眼看到过工人们的经验、智慧有多么深广，却远远没有今天感受得这样深刻。他越听越感到惭愧，越听也越感到兴奋。工人们大胆、豪爽的发言，使他心里也豁然开朗起来。在鞍钢的那些日子，安装一台台鼓风机的往事，在他脑子里一幕一幕地翻腾着。他忽然想起一个加快安装速度的办法。但是，他并没有马上说出来，却故意问道：“大家再考虑一下，两台鼓风机，四个月能不能安完？”
    这猛地一问，大家都怔住了。几十双眼睛直瞅着钳工组长刘振富，——他正低着头在合算呢。刘振富想，安装三个月，调整试车一个月，可能紧一点，也差不多……。有了八、九分把握，刘振富于是站起来说：“大家加点劲，四个月能干完！”
    会场上顿时活跃起来了。架子工、铆工、电焊工、钳工，一个个喜形于色，跃跃欲试。唯独配管工人们面面相觑，在那里发愁。配管工组长谢德祥说，按照老规矩，配管工的活总得跟在钳工后头，等钳工把鼓风机主体安完了，配管工才能进场。到那时候，横竖只剩下月把功夫，天大的本领，也安不完两台鼓风机的管子。
    这一说，会场又乱了套了。有的说，看来非增加工人不可；有人主张延长工期，众说纷纭，莫衷一是。这时，陈福堂才慢吞吞地说出自己的计策来。
    “我有一个主意，保证四个月把两台鼓风机安完交工。”陈福堂胸有成竹地说：“我们把历来安装鼓风机的老规矩打破，把安装顺序颠倒过来，先安透平机、鼓风机的辅属设备，再安它们的本体，这样就能让配管工提前进场，跟别的工种平行施工，这等于净赚两、三个月的时间。不过，常规打破了，我们必须同时采取严格的层层检查制度，保证工程质量。”
    工人们起初鸦雀无声地听陈福堂说着，继而就吵吵嚷嚷地欢跃起来了：“好，好，‘八一’一定交工！”“坚决保证优等质量！”……
    现在，两台鼓风机安装得很顺利，工人们的计划有很大可能会提前实现。他们大都搬到鼓风机旁边来住了，晚上常常要党支部书记催促才去睡觉。陈福堂和工人们都怀着一个雄心，一定要在这次安装中，跟胡兆森工段争夺先进青年工段。
    一场争论的风波过去以后，陈福堂又去找党支书王长余谈心。他说：“遇事找群众商量，真是没有解决不了的问题。工人们智慧这样大，干劲这样足，还怕赛不过鞍钢胡兆森工段？”
