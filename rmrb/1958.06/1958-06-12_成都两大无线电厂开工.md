Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 10th. The joint commencement ceremony for two major modern radio factories in the Chengdu area – the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory and the Chengdu Radio Factory – was held on June 8th.

	Both factories are key projects aided by the Soviet Union during China's First Five-Year Plan. The radio equipment produced by these two factories will meet modern world standards in terms of product specifications.

	Both factories adopted the policy of simultaneous construction, trial production, and production, greatly shortening the time required to reach their designed production capacity. The Southwest Radio Equipment Factory only took seventeen months from the start of construction of the main factory building to the start of production. Since the factory was fully put into production in February this year, some workshops have reached their designed production capacity three years and ten months ahead of the original plan.

	At the commencement ceremony on the 8th, Li Dazhang, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Sichuan Province, delivered a speech. He said that the official commencement of production at the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory and the Chengdu Radio Factory is another crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship. He called on all employees to continue to earnestly study the advanced technology and advanced experience of the Soviet Union and to combine the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries with China's specific practices. On behalf of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, Li Dazhang expressed his gratitude to all Soviet experts working at the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory and the Chengdu Radio Factory.

	Liu Yin, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, spoke at the meeting. He expressed his gratitude to the Soviet Party and government, the Soviet people, and all the Soviet experts who helped build the two factories on behalf of the State Council and the First Ministry of Machine Building.

	Also speaking at the meeting were Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, Guo Shifu, Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Soviet guests who assisted in the construction of the two factories.

    成都两大无线电厂开工
    据新华社成都10日电　成都地区两大现代化无线电工厂——西南无线电器材厂、成都无线电厂，8日联合举行开工生产典礼。
    这两个厂都是苏联帮助我国在第一个五年计划期间建设的重点工程。这两个厂出产的无线电器材，产品规格达到现代世界水平。
    这两个厂都采取了边建设、边试制、边生产的方针，大大缩短了达到设计生产能力的时间。西南无线电器材厂从主厂房动工到投入生产只花了十七个月。这个厂自今年2月全部投入生产以来，有的车间已比原计划提前三年零十个月达到设计生产能力。
    在8日的开工生产典礼大会上，中共四川省委书记、四川省省长李大章讲了话。他说，西南无线电器材厂和成都无线电厂正式开工生产，是中苏友谊的又一结晶。他号召全体职工要继续认真地学习苏联的先进技术和先进经验，把学习苏联和其他国家的先进经验与我国的具体实践结合起来。李大章代表中共四川省委和四川省人民委员会，向所有在西南无线电器材厂和成都无线电厂工作的苏联专家表示感谢。
    第一机械工业部副部长刘寅在会上讲了话。他代表国务院和第一机械工业部向苏联的党和政府、向苏联人民、向帮助两厂建设的全体苏联专家表示感谢。
    在大会上讲话的还有苏联驻华大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫、中共成都市委书记郭实夫，以及帮助两厂建设的苏联贵宾等。
