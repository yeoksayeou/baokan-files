Guangdong Rural Cadres All Cultivate Experimental Plots
Qi Shouliang's Experimental Plot Blossoms and Bears Fruit in Western Hunan

    (By our report) Guangdong Province's more than one million mu of agricultural experimental plots cultivated by cadres are being further developed and improved on the basis of the consolidation already achieved. Guangdong Province has decided to increase the area of experimental plots for late-season rice from the original one million mu to five million mu. At present, the early rice in these experimental plots is generally better than ordinary early rice fields. The yield per mu will be above 700-800 jin to 1,000 jin. The masses report that experimental plots have ten advantages: more fertilizer, deeper plowing, finer cultivation, better varieties, earlier transplanting, denser planting, reasonable irrigation and drainage, timely pest control, better management, and higher yields.

    In view of the great significance of experimental plots in promoting production and training cadres to be both red and expert, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently required all rural work cadres to cultivate experimental plots; leading cadres in finance, economics, culture, education, and political and legal departments should also be involved. All experimental plots should reach 10% to 15% of the total cultivated area. After inspecting and summarizing the experience of planting experimental plots in the first half of the year, Zhongshan County required all experimental plots in the county to implement a series of technological reforms; to standardize, systematize, and institutionalize technological reforms.

    Many of the existing experimental plots in agricultural cooperatives across the province have developed into larger-scale experimental farms. This form of development shows that experimental plots have been further consolidated and improved. These experimental farms combine existing technical night schools, agricultural middle schools, and experimental fields into one, learning scientific and technical knowledge while conducting relatively extensive experiments on varieties and cultivation methods. The characteristics of these forms are the unity of production and research, the unity of work and study, and the unity of teaching, learning, and doing. A technical night school and an agricultural middle school are at the same time a demonstration production team, an experimental field, and a technical guidance station, thus becoming the base for carrying out technological innovation, cultural revolution, and production guidance in rural areas.

    (By our report) Qi Shouliang, First Secretary of the CPC Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee, planted experimental soil in Huayuan County, which has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in the deep mountains. This is because the corn in this experimental soil emerged half a month earlier than the nearby corn, and grew vigorously and neatly. Local Miao and Han farmers were very happy and organized visiting groups to visit, requesting Qi Shouliang to teach farming techniques. This year, all 92,000 mu of corn sown in Huayuan County were sown and cultivated according to the experience of this experimental soil. The corn is growing better than in any previous year, already four or five feet tall, generally flowering and setting ears, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

    Qi Shouliang's experimental soil was fertilized with 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, spread with 400 dan of sand to improve the soil, and deeply ploughed to one foot. Double-plant wide-row close planting was implemented, and the amount of sowing was more than doubled than local customs. (Long Wenming)

    广东农村干部全种试验田
    齐寿良试验田在湘西开花结果
    本报讯　广东省一百多万亩干部农业试验田，在已经取得巩固的基础上正进一步发展与提高。广东省已决定全省晚造稻的试验田由原来的一百多万亩，增加到五百万亩。目前，这些试验田的早稻，普遍比一般早稻田好。每亩产量将在七、八百斤至一千斤以上。群众反映说，试验田有十好：施肥多，犁得深，耕作细，品种好，插秧早，种得密，排灌合理，除虫及时，管理好，产量高。
    鉴于试验田对推动生产和锻炼干部红、专的重大意义，中共广东省委最近要求所有农村工作干部都要种试验田；财经、文教、政法部门的领导干部也应当搞。全部试验田要达到总耕地面积的10％到15％。中山县检查总结了该县上半年种试验田的经验后，要求全县所有试验田都实行一系列的技术改革；做到技术改革规格化，系统化，制度化。
    全省现有农业社的试验田有许多已发展成为规模较大的试验农场。这种发展形式表明试验田已进一步的巩固和提高。这些试验农场把现有技术夜校、农业中学和试验场结合为一，一边学习科学技术知识，一边进行比较广泛的品种和栽培方法的试验。这些形式的特点是生产与研究统一，工作与学习统一，教、学、做统一。一所技术夜校、农业中学，同时又是示范生产队，又是试验场，又是技术指导站，这便成为农村开展技术革新、文化革命、指导生产的基点。（刘远修）
    本报讯　中共湘西土家族苗族自治州委第一书记齐寿良在花垣县种植的试验土，已经在深山里生根、开花、结果。这是因为这块试验土的包谷比附近的包谷提早半个月齐苗出土，长得又茁壮又整齐，当地苗、汉族农民高兴万分，纷纷组织参观团来参观，要求齐寿良传授耕作技术。今年，花垣全县播种的九万二千亩包谷，都是按照这块试验土的经验播种耕作的，包谷长得比那一年都好，已有四、五尺高，普遍扬花结球，丰收在望。
    齐寿良的试验土每亩施了一千担肥料，铺了四百担砂粒改良土壤，同时深耕到一尺，实行双株宽行密植，播种量比当地习惯增加一倍多。　（龙文明）
