Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 28th: The average electricity production per capita in the East Kazakhstan Oblast of the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union has now increased to 4,000 kilowatt-hours. This is three times the average electricity production per capita in France in 1957, and two and a half times that of West Germany. By 1960, the end of the current Five-Year Plan, the electricity production per capita in this oblast will greatly exceed that of the United States.

East Kazakhstan Oblast is one of the sixteen oblasts of the Kazakh Republic. Thirty years ago, the first hydroelectric power station in the Kazakh Republic was built here. Currently, power station construction is being vigorously pursued here.

Comprehensive utilization of the Irtysh River is an important aspect of power station construction in East Kazakhstan Oblast. According to the plan, a total of thirteen hydroelectric power stations will be built along the 1,700-kilometer stretch of the Irtysh River from Lake Zaysan in East Kazakhstan Oblast to Omsk in Siberia. Among them, the Shulginsk Hydroelectric Power Station in East Kazakhstan Oblast, with a generating capacity of over 300,000 kilowatts, began generating electricity several years ago and will be fully completed in less than a year. The electricity produced annually by the last turbine of this hydroelectric power station will exceed the total annual electricity production of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station, which was built in the early days of the Soviet regime. In addition to the Shulginsk Hydroelectric Power Station, the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Station, which is being intensively constructed on the Irtysh River, will begin generating electricity this year. Once this hydroelectric power station is fully operational, it will enable East Kazakhstan Oblast to catch up with and greatly exceed the United States in terms of electricity production per capita. East Kazakhstan Oblast is also currently building some thermal power stations. In Leninogorsk (the non-ferrous metal industry center of the Kazakh Republic), a large thermal power station will soon be completed.

    苏联东哈萨克州大兴电力站
    按人口计算的电力产量将远超美国
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联哈萨克共和国东哈萨克州按人口平均计算的电力产量现在已经增加到四千度。这等于1957年法国按人口平均计算的电力产量的三倍、西德这一产量的两倍半。到目前的五年计划结束时的1960年，这个州按人口计算的电力产量将大大超过美国。
    东哈萨克州是哈萨克共和国十六个州中的一个。三十年前，这里建成了哈萨克共和国第一个水电站。目前，这里正在大力进行电力站建设。
    综合利用额尔齐斯河是东哈萨克州电力站建设中的一个重要方面。根据计划，在额尔齐斯河从东哈萨克州的斋桑泊到西伯利亚的鄂木斯克长达一千七百多公里的一段，总共将建设十三个水力发电站。其中，位于东哈萨克州的发电能力为三十多万瓩的石山口水电站早在几年前已经开始发电，并且将在不到一年的时间全部建成。这个水电站的最后一台水轮机每年生产的电力将超过苏维埃政权初期建成的沃尔霍夫水电站全年的电力总产量。除石山口水电站以外，正在额尔齐斯河上加紧建设的布赫塔马水电站将在今年开始发电，这个水电站全部投入生产后，将使东哈萨克州按人口计算的电力产量赶上和大大超过美国。东哈萨克州现在还在建设一些火力发电站。在列宁戈尔斯克（哈萨克共和国的有色金属工业中心），一座大型火力发电站很快就要建成。
