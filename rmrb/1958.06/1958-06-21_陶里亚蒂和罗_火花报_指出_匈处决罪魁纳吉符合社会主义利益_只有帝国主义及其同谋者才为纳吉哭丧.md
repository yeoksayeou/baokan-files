Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 19th: Italian Communist Party Central Committee General Secretary Togliatti made a statement to a "National Evening News" reporter, criticizing the reaction of imperialist elements to the execution of Hungarian counter-revolutionary criminal Nagy.

He said: Many of those who are weeping and wailing over the Budapest verdict are hypocrites, because many of them have not only consistently welcomed the struggle to eliminate the people's democratic system and the socialist system, but may also have directly participated in this struggle.

Togliatti said that although the Western bloc, led by the United States, failed in 1956, they are still putting forward the elimination of the people's democratic system and the socialist system in Eastern European countries, starting with Hungary, as a demand and a basic goal.

Togliatti pointed out: The court that made the verdict on Nagy is a revolutionary institution of the Hungarian people. It is precisely it that bears the task of evaluating the facts and drawing appropriate conclusions. He said: The counter-revolutionary offensive in Hungary in 1956 was to overthrow the people's system, separate Hungary from the socialist camp, and throw it into the imperialist camp. Therefore, the struggle in Hungary is a political struggle and a class struggle of life and death, a struggle between reactionary forces and the people's democratic system, and the people's democratic system finally has to defend itself by all means, one of which is the people's revolutionary court.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 20th: The Romanian "Spark" newspaper published an article today entitled "Correct Verdict," welcoming the Hungarian Supreme Court's verdict on counter-revolutionary criminals Nagy Imre and his accomplices.

The article said that this verdict fully conforms to the interests of the Hungarian people and is conducive to the cause of socialism. This verdict demonstrates the correctness of the Hungarian Party and government's policies and the consolidation of the victory of the Hungarian working people in the 1956 anti-counter-revolutionary struggle.

    陶里亚蒂和罗“火花报”指出
    匈处决罪魁纳吉符合社会主义利益
    只有帝国主义及其同谋者才为纳吉哭丧
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社罗马19日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会总书记陶里亚蒂向“国家晚报”记者发表谈话，抨击帝国主义分子对处死匈牙利反革命罪犯纳吉的反应。
    他说：那些为布达佩斯的判决而嚎啕痛哭的人很多是伪善者，因为他们中间有不少人不仅一贯欢迎企图消灭人民民主制度和社会主义制度的斗争，而且可能也直接参加了这个斗争。
    陶里亚蒂说，尽管以美国为首的西方集团在1956年是失败了，但是它们现在仍然把从匈牙利开始来消灭东欧国家的人民民主制度和社会主义制度当作一种要求和基本目的提出来。
    陶里亚蒂指出：对纳吉作出判决的法院是匈牙利人民的革命的机构。正是它担负着评价事实和作出适当结论的任务。他说：1956年匈牙利的反革命进攻是要推翻人民制度，使匈牙利脱离社会主义阵营，投入帝国主义阵营。因此，匈牙利所进行的斗争是你死我活的政治斗争和阶级斗争，是反动势力同人民民主制度之间的斗争，人民民主制度最后不得不用一切手段来保卫自己，这些手段之一就是人民革命的法院。
    据新华社布加勒斯特20日电罗马尼亚“火花报”今天发表了一篇题为“正确的判决”的文章，欢迎匈牙利最高法院对反革命罪犯纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的判决。
    文章说，这个判决完全符合匈牙利人民的利益，并且有利于社会主义的事业。这一判决表现了匈牙利党和政府政策的正确性，表现了匈牙利劳动人民在1956年反对反革命斗争的胜利的巩固。
