Editor's Note

　　A New Method of Obtaining Water from the Earth
    In arid and rainless mountainous areas, people must solve the water problem to conquer nature. Where does water come from? It is nothing more than from the sky, the ground, and underground. If the sky does not love to rain, and there is a lack of water on the ground, then the only way is to get water from underground. Farmers in various places have already created many methods of utilizing groundwater. Now, the members of the Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan County, Gansu Province, have come up with a clever new method. They dig hundreds of interconnected wells on the ground and build underground channels to divert groundwater to irrigate farmland on high mountains. We say this is a clever method because it utilizes some small water sources that were originally difficult to use, turning small water into big water, increasing irrigation capacity; also because the channels are built underground, they do not affect the cultivated land area and can reduce water evaporation, allowing limited water to play a greater role.
    Digging interconnected wells has been the wish of the people in this area for many years. Now their wish has become a reality, and it has established a new method of extracting groundwater for arid and rainless highland mountainous areas.

　　向地要水的新方法
    在干旱无雨的山区，人们要战胜自然，就必须解决水的问题。水从哪里来？不外是天上、地上和地下。如果天不爱下雨，地面上又缺少水，那么只有向地下要水了。利用地下水的办法，各地农民已经有许多创造，现在甘肃皋兰县庄子坪农业社的社员们，又想出了一个巧妙的新方法。他们在地上打通百眼串井，在地下修暗渠，把地下水引上高山灌溉农田。我们说这是个妙巧的方法，就在于它把一些本来难以利用的小水源也利用起来，使小水变成了大水，增加了灌溉能力；还因为渠道修在地下，既不影响耕地面积，又能减少水分的蒸发，使有限的水发挥更大的作用。
    打串井是这个地区人民多少年来的愿望。现在他们的愿望已经变成了现实，而且为干旱无雨的高源山区树立了吸取地下水的新方法。
