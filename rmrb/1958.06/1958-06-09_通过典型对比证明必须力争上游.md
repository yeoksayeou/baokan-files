　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th June: The Chinese Communist Party Changshu County Committee has summarized the work of two agricultural cooperatives, establishing opposing examples to profoundly educate cadres and the masses throughout the county in studying and implementing the general line of socialist construction.

　　The Limin Cooperative and the Xieshui Cooperative are neighbors. The former strives for the top, while the latter is content to remain in the middle. The Xieshui Cooperative has good soil, superior water conservancy conditions, abundant means of production, and rich farming experience. Except for labor, the Limin Cooperative is inferior to its neighbor in every aspect. However, due to one striving for the top and the other content with the middle, the Limin Cooperative's average wheat, barley, and metempsychosis wheat yield per mu this year is nearly four hundred jin, while the Xieshui Cooperative only has two hundred odd jin.

　　In the Limin Cooperative's cooperative and team cadres, poor and lower-middle peasant components account for 70%, while in the Xieshui Cooperative's cooperative and team cadres, 67% are well-to-do middle peasants and old upper-middle peasants. They have two different ideological attitudes towards the Party's leadership. The Limin Cooperative resolutely acts in accordance with the Party's instructions and requirements. During the autumn sowing last year, when the Party issued the call for a great leap forward in production, the cooperative's Party branch led the masses in summarizing and analyzing the experience and lessons of the 1956 bumper harvest and the 1957 production reduction, believing that the key lies in strengthening leadership, overcoming conservative thinking, boosting morale, and implementing various measures. Thus, a high tide of production was launched, the autumn harvest and sowing tasks were completed on schedule, and wheat fields were generally fertilized five times, strengthening field management. The Xieshui Cooperative, led by branch secretary Wei Xuexue, had a majority of cadres with right-leaning conservative ideas, insufficient enthusiasm, and delayed autumn harvest and sowing. Wheat fields were fertilized only three times. They claimed that the thousand-foot mud fertilizer was ineffective or that the manure pit mud had no fertility.

　　The Limin Cooperative's cadres take the lead in participating in production, leading production, and sharing weal and woe with the masses. Last winter, in temperatures of minus five degrees, Wang Genjin, the Party branch secretary of the cooperative, led cadres in breaking the ice to collect mud fertilizer. The cooperative members consciously followed suit, and the fertilizer accumulation campaign has continued to this day. After the task of accumulating 240,000 jin of grass fertilizer was issued recently, the teams worked non-stop, the boats never stopped rowing, and the grass fertilizer was accumulated ahead of schedule. Cadres often leave early and return late, living together to study work. The Xieshui Cooperative's Party branch secretary and cooperative director often start work late and finish early, fearing wind, rain, and hardship, so that the cooperative members also work sluggishly. Of the cooperative's sixty-odd agricultural boats, less than 40% were mobilized for fertilizer accumulation; the routine of not going out in strong winds, not moving in light rain, leaving late and returning early, and only going near and not far is unbreakable. The cooperative's several main responsible cadres have poor unity, with division of labor like division of family, rarely going deep into the masses.

　　The Changshu County Party Committee used the materials of these two cooperatives to establish opposing examples, which has great educational significance for cadres and the masses throughout Changshu. Now, the Xieshui Cooperative, through summarizing its work, has further seen its shortcomings and expressed its determination to change and strive to catch up with and surpass the Limin Cooperative. The Limin Cooperative also expressed its determination to continue to implement the general line and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

### 通过典型对比证明必须力争上游

    常熟县委宣传总路线的一个好方法
　　通过典型对比证明必须力争上游
    条件较好的泄水社甘居中游夏收亩产仅两百多斤
    条件较差的利民社力争上游夏收亩产将近四百斤
    新华社南京6日电　中共江苏省常熟县委总结两个农业社的工作，树立对立面，使全县干部和群众在学习和贯彻社会主义建设总路线中得到深刻的教育。
    这个县的利民社和泄水社是近邻，前者力争上游，后者却甘居中游。泄水社田地土质好，水利条件优越，生产资料多，种田经验丰富。利民社除去劳力和它相仿，其他都不如这个近邻。但是由于一个力争上游，一个甘居中游，利民社今年小麦、大麦和元麦平均亩产近四百斤，泄水社只有两百多斤。
    利民社的社、队干部中，贫农和下中农成份占70％，泄水社社、队干部有67％是富裕中农和老上中农。他们对党的领导存在两种不同的思想态度。利民社坚决按照党的指示和要求办事。去年秋种时，党发出生产大跃进的号召，这个社的党支部就领导群众总结和分析了1956年丰收和1957年减产的经验教训，认为关键在于加强领导，克服保守思想，鼓足干劲，贯彻各项措施，于是掀起了生产高潮，按期完成秋收秋种任务，麦田普遍施肥五次，加强田间管理。泄水社以支部书记韦雪雪为首，多数干部有右倾保守思想，干劲不足，秋收秋种拖得晚，麦田施肥只有三次。他们不是说千脚泥肥效不足，就是说粪坑泥没有肥力。
    利民社干部带头参加生产，领导生产，和群众同甘共苦。在去冬零下五度的天气，社里党支部书记王根金带领干部破冰取泥肥，社员自觉地跟着干起来，积肥运动一直持续到现在。最近一次积草肥二十四万斤的任务下达后，各队人不停手，船不停橹，提前积足草肥。干部经常早出夜归，集中住宿，研究工作。泄水社党支部书记和社主任经常迟上工早息工，怕风怕雨怕吃苦，以致社员干活也拖拖拉拉。全社六十多条农船，出动积肥的不到40％，大风不开，小雨不动，迟出早归，只近不远的常规牢不可破。这个社的几个主要负责干部团结很差，分工如分家，很少深入群众。
    中共常熟县委用这两个社的材料树立对立面，对常熟全县干部和群众教育意义很大。现在泄水社通过总结工作，进一步看到了缺点，表示决心改变，争取赶上和超过利民社。利民社也表示继续贯彻执行总路线，争取秋熟丰收。
