    A Centenarian's Words
    In front of the Liqun Cinema in Shenyang, a truck publicizing the General Line was surrounded by people. Everyone was attentively listening to a speech by a PLA Lieutenant Colonel. As soon as the speech ended, an old man with white hair and beard squeezed through the crowd to the front of the truck, grasped the Lieutenant Colonel's hands tightly, and with tears in his eyes, said, "Thank you so much, thank you for telling us the words of the Party and Chairman Mao."
    "Did you understand, old man?"
    "I understand everything, Chairman Mao wants everyone to work harder to build the country! Catching up with Britain in fifteen years, right?" The old man wiped his eyes with a handkerchief and said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, I, an old widower, don't know where my bones would have been thrown!"
    The old man's name is Wang Weilin, and he is already one hundred and nineteen years old this year. He joined an opera troupe at the age of seven and experienced the dark ages of the Qing Dynasty, the puppet Manchukuo, and the Kuomintang. But it wasn't until after liberation that he enjoyed human happiness. Because he was too old, the People's Government repeatedly advised him to retire and enjoy his old age, with the state paying all living expenses, but he firmly refused. He said, "Our country is still poor, building factories and roads all require money, and I can still do something." It wasn't until the spring of 1956 that he retired after repeated persuasion from the government.
    After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party announced the General Line for socialist construction, the old man was happy all day long. Although he had difficulty walking, he still supported himself to squeeze into the crowd to listen to the propaganda again and again. He said, "Although I can't work anymore, my mouth can still speak, I want to tell everyone Chairman Mao's words, so that everyone can work hard to build our country better."

    百岁老人一席话
    沈阳市利群电影院的门前，一辆宣传总路线的卡车被人们包围得水泄不通。大家都在聚精会神地倾听着一位解放军中校的演讲。讲话刚结束，一位须发苍白的老人从人群中挤到车跟前，用双手紧紧握住中校的手，眼眶里闪着泪花，说：“太感谢你啦，感谢你把党和毛主席的话告诉我们。”
    “您老听懂了吧？”
    “全明白啦，毛主席要大伙加劲建设国家呀！十五年赶过英国，对吧？”老人说到这里用手帕擦了擦眼睛说：“要不是共产党来了，我这孤老头的骨头早不知道扔到哪里了！”
    老人的名字叫王维林，今年已经一百一十九岁了。他七岁就进了戏班子，经历了清朝、伪满和国民党的黑暗年代。但一直到解放后，他才享到了人间的幸福。由于他年纪太大，人民政府曾几次劝他退休养老，由国家支付全部生活费用，但他坚决不依。他说：“咱国家还穷，盖工厂、修马路，都需要钱我还能做些事情嘛。”直到1956年春天，经政府再三劝说他才退休了。
    党的“八大”二次会议公布了社会主义建设总路线后，这位老人整天乐得合不拢嘴，尽管他走路不太方便，也要支撑着挤到人群中去一次再次地听宣传。他说：“虽然我不能干活了，可我的嘴还能说话，我要把毛主席的话告诉大伙，让大伙使足劲，把咱们国家建设得更好。”
