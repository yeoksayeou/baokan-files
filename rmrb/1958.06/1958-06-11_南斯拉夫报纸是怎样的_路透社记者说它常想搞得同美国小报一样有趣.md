Yugoslav Newspapers:
Reuters Reporter Says They Often Try to be as Interesting as American Tabloids

Donald Duck and Sylvester the Cat (names of two comic strips) are doing their part every day to help sell Yugoslav communist newspapers.

"Borba," Yugoslavia's number one daily newspaper, may be the official mouthpiece of the League of Communists, but most readers first turn to the last page every morning to see what trouble Sylvester the Cat has gotten into.

Comic strips, detective novels, fashion pages, cooking recipes, the daily Ripley's "Believe It or Not," and daily chronicles of Sylvester the Cat's adventures have helped "Borba" become the liveliest and most interesting communist newspaper in Eastern Europe (!).

Ten years ago, Yugoslav newspapers were as dry and dogmatic as "Pravda." Today, they often try to be as interesting as American tabloids.

After the Yugoslavs broke with Moscow in 1948, their newspapers began to abandon the old-fashioned layout and dull, serious content that most communist dailies within the Soviet bloc (socialist countries in the eyes of the West) still favored. Now, the uniqueness of Belgrade newspapers sometimes surprises even Yugoslavia's emphasis on unique communists.

Marxists are often surprised by the "pretty legs" photos and American-style features that frequently appear in Yugoslav newspapers. Recently, a pictorial weekly published by "Borba" Publishing House and sold at newsstands was seized and burned by the police because it reprinted a "daring" photo published by a British newspaper, which officials accused of being obscene.

Yugoslav newspapers try to operate on the principle of providing readers with what they need. This approach sometimes gives editors a headache, but not a very serious one.

The newspapers are run by semi-official publishing enterprises and are not directly controlled by the government, but on all political and foreign policy issues, the government's word is law. On most other issues, editors have broad freedom of choice, but may be subjected to "ex post facto" complaints from the publishing committee. These publishing committees were established in newspaper and magazine offices about a year ago.

Publishing committees do sometimes put pressure on editors, but this is usually after the fact. In any case, editors and most journalists are loyal communists, and they roughly know how far they can stray from the "Party line." Politically, the newspapers all follow a straight and narrow communist path (?!).

The fundamental difference between them and most newspapers in the Soviet Union and other communist countries lies in their selection of news and features, and in their entertainment value.

"Borba," "Politika," "Vecernje Novosti," "Slobodna Dalmacija," and other newspapers are filled with international news, usually obtained from Western news agencies, and supplemented by long, detailed reports from correspondents stationed in major capitals around the world.

Occasionally, a piece of news is deleted because it does not conform to the "Party line," but this is rare.

Although the newspapers read by the average Yugoslav are the official organs of a one-party government, he can generally expect to read as much news as the average Western reader, and much more than the average Eastern European (with the possible exception of Poland).

Yugoslav readers can read an extremely wide range of "human interest stories," including frank and often bloody descriptions of crimes and disasters, things that are rarely mentioned in Soviet newspapers.

Whenever President Tito or another senior leader speaks, his speech is published in its entirety, even if it sometimes takes up four or five pages or more, but the usual rule is to write briefly and concisely, and editorials rarely exceed one column.

The movement for originality and liveliness in the Yugoslav press largely stems from the sales "war" between the country's two major newspapers, "Borba" and "Politika."

"Borba" was founded by communists before World War II, when it was an illegal newspaper, and is now generally regarded as the official mouthpiece. In terms of sales, it has never been able to catch up with "Politika." "Politika's" advantage is that it was founded 55 years ago, so readers have long loved reading it, although it is now just as loyal to communism as "Borba" (?!).

Despite its livelier layout and good picture design and variety of interesting features, "Borba" has lost 16,000 readers in the past three years; while "Politika," although not as attractively designed, is more popular due to its more complete foreign news, local news and personal ads, and has added 54,000 new subscribers.

According to the latest statistics, "Politika" has a record daily circulation of around 300,000 copies, and "Borba" has 250,000 copies.

The editors of "Borba" do not miss any opportunity to increase sales.

When "Politika" increased the price of its thick Sunday edition of 24 pages to 20 dinars (sixpence) due to increased production costs, "Borba" quickly announced that it would continue to maintain the general weekday sales price of 10 dinars on Sundays.

When "Politika" began to publish weekly English and French courses, "Borba" immediately followed suit by publishing Russian and German courses. When "Politika" announced plans to launch a new pictorial, "Borba" preempted it by publishing American-style weekly comic strips, which are now the most popular things among Yugoslav children.

"Borba" continues to strive to promote sales, and immediately came up with a new idea, that is, to attach a four-page tabloid-sized supplement to each copy every day: Monday is a science supplement, Tuesday is a film supplement, Wednesday is a children's corner, Thursday is family management, Friday is a radio supplement, and Saturday is an agricultural supplement. On Sundays, add eight pages of features, and on Mondays, there are two full pages of sports news.

Walt Disney's comic strips purchased from the United States often appear in most Yugoslav newspapers, along with many other selected famous American comic strips. They have all been painstakingly translated into Serbian. "Politika" uses Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck to compete with "Borba's" Sylvester the Cat.

The pictorial weekly "Vjesnik u Srijedu" published in Zagreb (Yugoslavia's second largest city), which claims to have the largest circulation in Yugoslavia, with a weekly sales volume of 400,000 copies, is filled with non-political features and cartoons, and sometimes publishes photos of scantily clad movie stars and world-wide synopses just for fun.

Another newspaper whose circulation is growing rapidly is Belgrade's "Vecernje Novosti," which says it sells 100,000 copies of four pages a day. This newspaper is very similar to the photo-filled British "Daily Mirror" in terms of tabloid opening and appearance.

    南斯拉夫报纸是怎样的
    路透社记者说它常想搞得同美国小报一样有趣
    唐老鸭和笨猫（两种连环画的名字）每天在尽自己的一份力量帮助推销南斯拉夫的共产党报纸。
    南斯拉夫的第一号日报“战斗报”也许是共产主义者联盟的官方喉舌，但是大多数读者在每天早上首先翻阅的是最后一版，看看笨猫又闯了什么祸。
    连环图画、侦探小说、时装页、烹饪法、每天刊登的里普利的“信不信由你”以及逐日的关于笨猫历险的记载都帮助了“战斗报”成为东欧的最生动、最有趣味的共产党报纸。（！）
    十年前，南斯拉夫的报纸正像“真理报”一样枯燥、一样教条。而在今天，它常常想搞得同美国的小报一样有趣味。
    在1948年南斯拉夫人同莫斯科决裂以后，他们的报纸开始抛弃苏联集团（西方眼里的社会主义国家）以内的多数共产党日报仍然赞成的老一套的版面和沉闷的、严肃的内容。现在，贝尔格莱德报纸的独特性有时连南斯拉夫的强调独特性的共产主义者也感到吃惊。
    马克思主义者常常为经常在南斯拉夫报上出现的“大腿美”照片和美国式的特稿而吃惊。最近，在书摊上出售的由“战斗报”社出版的一种图画周刊曾被警察搜出焚毁，因为它翻印了一家英国报纸所刊登的一张“大胆的”照片，官员们指责这张照片是猥亵的。
    南斯拉夫的报馆设法以提供读者所需要的东西的原则来办报。这种方针有时使编辑们很伤脑筋，但是却不是怎样严重的伤脑筋。
    报纸是由半官方的出版企业办的，并不受政府的直接控制，但在一切政治问题和外交政策问题上，政府的话就是法律。在大部分其他问题上，编辑是有广泛的选择自由的，只是可能会受到出版委员会的“事后”埋怨。各报社和杂志社是在大约一年前设立这种出版委员会的。
    出版委员会有时的确做到了对编辑施加压力，但是这通常是在事后。无论如何，编辑和大部分记者都是忠诚的共产党人，他们大略知道他们究竟可以离开“党的路线”多远。从政治上来说，各报都遵循着共产主义（？！）的笔直的、狭窄的道路。
    它们同苏联和其他共产党国家的大多数报纸的根本区别在于它们对新闻和特稿的选择以及它们的趣味性。
    在“战斗报”、“政治报”、“消息报”、“解放报”和其他各报上充满着通常是从西方通讯社得来的国际新闻，并且以分布在世界各主要国家首都的记者发来的长篇详细的消息作为补充。
    偶而有一条消息由于不符合“党的路线”而被删去，但是这种情况是很少的。
    南斯拉夫普通人所看的报纸虽然是一党政府的官方机关报，但是总的说来，他却可以指望同一般西方读者读到同样多的消息，并且要比东欧一般百姓（可能波兰除外）读到的消息多得多。
    南斯拉夫读者可以读到极其广泛的“人生报道”，其中包括关于犯罪和灾祸的坦率的并且往往是血淋淋的描述，这些事情是苏联报上很少提到的。
    不论在什么时候，只要铁托总统或者另外一位高级领袖一讲话，他的讲话就被全部刊登出来，即使有时要占四、五页以上的篇幅，然而通常的规则是，写得短而干脆，社论很少超过一栏。
    南斯拉夫报界的力求独出心裁和活泼生动的运动一大部分是从该国的两大报纸“战斗报”和“政治报”之间的销路“战”而产生的。
    “战斗报”是共产党人在第二次世界大战以前创办的，在当时它是一家非法的报纸，而现在一般被认为是官方的喉舌了。在销路方面，它一直没有能赶上“政治报”。“政治报”的有利条件是它是在五十五年前创办的，因此读者长期爱读，虽然它现在完全跟“战斗报”一样忠于共产主义。（？！）
    “战斗报”尽管版面比较活泼，并且还有良好的图片设计和多种多样的有趣的特稿，但是它在过去三年中还是失掉了一万六千个读者；而“政治报”虽然没有设计得那么动人，但是却由于它的比较完全的国外新闻、地方新闻和私人启事而更为人喜爱，它又增加了五万四千个新订户。
    根据最新的统计数字，“政治报”的每日销数开了三十万份左右的纪录，“战斗报”为二十五万份。
    “战斗报”的编辑们丝毫也不错过任何增加销路的机会。
    当“政治报”由于生产成本提高而把共有二十四版的厚厚的星期日版的价格提高到二十个第纳尔（六辨士）的时候，“战斗报”赶紧宣布，它在星期日将继续保持一般平日的销售价格十个第纳尔。
    当“政治报”开始每周刊登一次英文和法文课程的时候，“战斗报”立即仿效它的做法，刊登俄文和德文课程。当“政治报”宣布发行新的画报的计划的时候，“战斗报”便抢先刊登美国式的每周一次的连环画，现在它已经成为南斯拉夫儿童最欢迎的东西了。
    “战斗报”继续努力推广销路，它立即想出了一个新的主意，那就是每天每份附送一份四页小型报大小的增刊：每星期一是科学增刊、每星期二是电影增刊、每星期三是儿童园地、每星期四是家庭管理、每星期五是无线电增刊、每星期六是农业增刊。在星期日增加八版特写，在星期一有两满页的体育消息。
    向美国购买的华尔特·迪斯尼的连环画经常在大多数的南斯拉夫报纸上出现，同时还有许多挑选出来的其它著名的美国连环画。它们都被经过一番苦心地翻译成塞尔维亚文。“政治报”用米老鼠和唐老鸭同“战斗报”的笨猫竞争。
    自称在南斯拉夫销路最广的报纸要算萨格勒布（南斯拉夫第二大城）出版的画报周刊“星期三消息”，它每周的销售量为四十万份，它登满了非政治性的特稿和漫画，有时还刊登一些衣服穿得极少的电影明星的照片和一些只是为了满足乐趣的世界性综合报道。
    销路正在急速增长的另一家报纸是贝尔格莱德的“新闻晚报”，它说每天四版共销十万份，这家报纸在小型报的开张和外表方面同满载照片的英国的“每日镜报”十分相像。
