    To Prevent Land Salinization
    In the Great Leap Forward of agricultural production, water conservancy construction in various regions has progressed rapidly, achieving great results. Many counties, townships, and communes have basically achieved water conservancy in a very short time, which will play an extremely important role in future large-scale agricultural production increases. However, in some areas of the Huimin Special Zone in Shandong, the work of alkali reduction and prevention is not well done in water conservancy projects, especially in water diversion irrigation areas and siphon irrigation areas. For example, in the siphon irrigation areas of Lijin, Boxing, and Bin County, there are still many places without alkali prevention ditches, or where alkali prevention ditches exist but are not dredged, preventing the alkali from being discharged. As a result, the land along the main and branch canals has begun to show signs of salinization. In Zhengjia Township's Advanced Cooperative and Beizhen's Xianfeng Cooperative in Bin County, more than 200 mu of land along the ditches has become saline-alkali land. In Jianjun and Jianshe Cooperatives of Xishang Township in Guangrao County, 1,500 mu of good land has been turned into saline-alkali land because the alkali prevention ditches were not dredged, and even wheat seedlings have been killed by the alkali. Therefore, I suggest that all regions pay attention to alkali prevention when digging ditches for water diversion in farmland water conservancy construction, and drainage ditches must be dug when digging irrigation ditches; existing alkali prevention ditches must be dredged immediately to prevent land salinization.

    要防止土地盐碱化
    在农业生产大跃进中，各地兴修农田水利一日千里，取得了很大成绩。不少县、乡、社已在很短的时间内，基本上达到了水利化，这对今后农业大增产将有极其重要的作用。但是，山东惠民专区还有部分地区在兴修水利中，特别是引水灌区、虹吸灌区，排碱减碱搞的不好。如利津、博兴、滨县等地虹吸灌区，还有许多地方没有防碱沟，或有防碱沟而没疏通，排不出碱去，因而沿干、支沟渠两岸的土地已开始冒碱。滨县郑家乡先进社、北镇先锋社沿沟土地已出现盐碱达二百余亩。广饶县西商乡建军、建设两社，因防碱沟未疏通，有一千五百亩好地变成了盐碱地，甚至有的地连麦苗都碱死。为此，我建议各地在兴修农田水利中，挖沟引水必须注意防碱，挖顺水沟一定要挖排碱沟；已经有防碱沟的要立即疏通，以防止土地盐碱化。
