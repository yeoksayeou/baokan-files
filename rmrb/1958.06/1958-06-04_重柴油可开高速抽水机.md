　　Heavy Diesel Can Run High-Speed Water Pumps
    Currently, the supply of light diesel is relatively tight. Heavy diesel can be produced in large quantities domestically and is cheaper, but many people have always believed that heavy diesel is not easy to use, and even if it is used, it can only run low-speed water pumps and cannot be used to run medium-speed and high-speed water pumps. After the "Two Antis" movement, the Changde County Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy Bureau broke with conservative thinking. In mid-April, they selected the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative of Qiliqiao Township to test the use of heavy diesel to run a 60-horsepower high-speed diesel engine. The result was that the engine ran and loaded normally without any malfunctions. After an on-site appraisal by personnel from the Changde Special Commissioner's Office, it was deemed completely feasible to replace light diesel with heavy diesel. The success of this experiment can not only solve the difficulty of insufficient light diesel supply, but also reduce the production costs for agricultural cooperatives, because using heavy diesel can save more than 30% compared to using light diesel.
    The method of using heavy diesel is simple. Just add a heavy diesel filter box to the original power machine that burns light diesel. Each unit only costs about 110 yuan for installation. The heavy diesel filter box is divided into two layers, the upper layer for oil storage and the lower layer for installing empty pipes. The heat of the exhaust pipe is used to heat the heavy diesel in the upper layer of the oil tank to melt and clarify it. A filter is added to the outer layer of the oil tank, with twelve layers of copper wire or gauze inside, so that the heavy diesel undergoes three stages of heating, melting, clarification, and filtration (when the weather is clear, solar heating and clarification can be used) to enter the machine. When starting the car, use light diesel for about ten minutes. After ten minutes, use heavy diesel for both the light and heavy diesel tanks. When parking, close the door of the heavy diesel tank and open the door of the light diesel tank, using light diesel for ten minutes. This can play a flushing role, ensure normal engine operation, and prevent component failures. Various places can try it out.

### 重柴油可开高速抽水机

　　重柴油可开高速抽水机
    现在轻柴油的供应比较紧张，重柴油国内可大量生产，而且价格较低，但很多人一向认为重柴油不好用，即使用也只能开低速抽水机，不能用来开中速、高速抽水机。经过“双反”运动，常德县农林水利局打破保守思想，在4月中旬选定七里桥乡前进农业社试用重柴油开动六十马力的高速柴油机，结果机器转动和负荷都正常，无任何故障。经常德专署派人实地鉴定，认为以重柴油代替轻柴油完全可行。这一试验成功，不仅可以解决轻柴油供应不足的困难，而且为农业社降低生产成本。因为使用重柴油比使用轻柴油要节约30％以上。
    使用重柴油方法简单，只要在原烧轻柴油的动力机上加设一个重柴油过滤箱，每台只花装置费一百一十元左右。重柴油过滤箱分上下两层，上层容油，下层安装空管，利用排气管的热度对油箱上层的重柴油进行加温，使其溶化澄清，在油箱的外层加设一个滤清器，内装十二层铜丝或纱布，使重柴油经过加温溶化、澄清、过滤三个环节（天晴可利用太阳加温、澄清）进入机器，刚开车十分钟左右全用轻柴油发动，经十分钟后，将轻重柴油两个油箱全部使用重柴油，在停车时把重柴油箱的门关住，将轻柴油箱的门打开，用轻柴油开动十分钟，这样可以起到冲洗作用，保证机器转动正常，机件也不会发生故障。各地可以试用。湖南省常德县农林水利局  周正刚  贾武勋
