Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 21st. Workers at the Zengcheng Sugar Factory, after five days and nights of hard work, successfully trial-produced a small steam power engine. Responsible persons from relevant departments in Guangdong Province believe that this machine is of great significance for solving the power problems of agricultural cooperatives.

This steam power engine is divided into two parts: the power engine and the boiler. The construction principle of the power engine is the same as that of a general steam engine, but it is much simpler. Its components are cylinder, piston, crankshaft, eccentric wheel, flywheel, etc. It uses the steam from the boiler to act on the piston and drive the flywheel to rotate. The boiler is made from old gasoline drums that have been reinforced and modified. Coal, firewood, charcoal, grass, and chaff, etc., can all be used as its fuel, and liquid fuel is not required.

This steam engine has a wide range of uses. When equipped with a universal grinder, seedling cutter, rice threshing machine, grain thresher, and other machinery, it can become a power processing plant. The steam power engine is simple to manufacture and easy to operate. Each unit costs about 700 yuan, and ordinary machinery factories can manufacture it. The Zengcheng Sugar Factory initially plans to produce one hundred units this year.

    增城糖厂职工苦战五昼夜  制成小型农用蒸汽动力机
    新华社广州21日电  增城糖厂职工经过五昼夜苦战，试制成功了一种小型蒸汽动力机。广东省有关部门负责人认为，这种机器对解决农业社的动力问题有着重要的意义。
    这种蒸汽动力机分两部分：动力机和锅炉。动力机的构造原理与一般蒸汽机相同，但要简单得多，它的组成部分是汽缸、活塞、曲轴、偏心轮、飞轮等。它利用锅炉的蒸汽作用于活塞，推动飞轮运转。锅炉是用旧汽油筒经过加固改装成的。煤、木柴、炭、草和糠等，都可以做它的燃料，不需用液体燃料。
    这种蒸汽机用途很广，装上万能磨、切苗机、打禾机、脱谷机等机械，就可以成为一座动力加工厂。蒸汽动力机的制造简单，操作容易，每部成本约七百元，普通的机械厂都能制造。增城糖厂初步计划要在今年内生产一百部。
