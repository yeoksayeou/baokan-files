    Pond Turns into a "Treasure Trove"
    One Mu of Pond Yields an Average Annual Income Equivalent to 10,000 Jin of Grain
    The Xincun Agricultural Cooperative in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, displaying the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act, broke with convention and transformed a one-mu sewage pond into a "treasure trove"—raising fish at the bottom, building sheds on and around the pond to grow melons, and cultivating "water hyacinth" on the surface as pig feed. Over the past two years, the pond has generated an average annual income of 598 yuan, equivalent to the value of 10,000 jin of rice.
    The Xincun Cooperative has little land but a large population. In 1954, when studying how to expand the scope of production, someone suggested raising fish in the pond, and the cooperative management committee immediately released fish fry into a sewage pond in front of the village. That year, they spent only 20 yuan on fish fry and produced 350 jin of fish by the end of the year, generating an income of 168 yuan.
    In 1956, the cooperative planned to convert all the paddy fields used for growing vegetables to grow grain crops, so Deputy Director Liu Xiusheng planted a few pumpkin seedlings by the pond and built a shed over the water for the vines to grow on. Subsequently, more than 100 pumpkin seedlings were planted around the pond, producing 4,400 jin of pumpkins. In 1957, the pond's surroundings and airspace were used to grow not only pumpkins but also winter melons. Before planting the melons, amaranth and scallions were planted, and after planting the melons, radishes, cabbage, and Chinese cabbage were planted, generating an annual income of 190 yuan.
    In 1956, cooperative director Peng Guangxian brought back several seedlings of "water hyacinth" from a meeting in Nanchang, which multiplied to fill the entire pond in less than a month. During the four months of vigorous growth, more than 300 jin could be harvested daily, solving the feed problem for six or seven pigs. To prevent the "water hyacinth" from overgrowing and suffocating the fish, Peng Guangxian worked with cooperative members to find a win-win solution: they used bamboo poles to create a square open area in the center of the pond, controlling the growth of "water hyacinth" in that area. At the end of the year, they calculated that not only was the fish yield not reduced, but the "water hyacinth" yielded 24,000 jin in a year, worth 240 yuan.
    "One pond, three uses" was a success! The cooperative management committee carefully summarized their experience. Last year, out of the cooperative's 34 ponds, 23, covering 18 mu, were used for raising fish and growing vegetables, and 15 ponds were used for cultivating "water hyacinth," generating a total income of 3,857 yuan. Currently, the Pingxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is preparing to promote this method through visits, exhibitions, and other means.

### 水塘变成了“宝库”  一亩水塘每年平均收入折合万斤谷

    水塘变成了“宝库”
    一亩水塘每年平均收入折合万斤谷
    江西萍乡县新村农业社发扬敢想、敢做的共产主义风格，打破了陈规，将一口一亩面积大的污水塘变成了“宝库”——水底养鱼，塘上、塘边搭棚种瓜，水面蓄养生猪饲料“水浮莲”。两年来，这口塘每年平均收入达五百九十八元，相当于一万斤稻谷的价值。
    新村社田少人多。1954年研究如何扩大生产范围的问题时，有人提出了在水塘内养鱼，社管理委员会立即在村前的一口污水塘内放下了鱼种。这年只花二十元买鱼苗，年底即产鱼三百五十斤，收入一百六十八元。
    1956年，社里计划种菜的水田全部改种粮食作物，副主任刘秀盛便在塘边种了几株南瓜，水上搭棚，让瓜牵蔓生长。随后，塘的四周即陆续种上南瓜一百多兜，产瓜四千四百斤。1957年，塘四周和塘上空的利用不仅种了南瓜，还种了冬瓜。种瓜前种上苋菜、香葱，种瓜后又种上萝卜、白菜、黄芽白等，一年收入达一百九十元。
    1956年社主任彭光贤到南昌开会带回的几兜“水浮莲”，不到一个月就繁殖满了全塘。在繁盛期间的四个月中，每天可捞三百多斤，解决了六、七头生猪的饲料。为了防止“水浮莲”繁殖满塘，把鱼闷死。彭光贤找社员一道研究，想出了个两全其美的办法：水塘中央用竹竿架开一个四方空面，控制“水浮莲”不在空面生长。年终一算。不仅鱼的产量未少，“水浮莲”一年收二万四千斤，价值二百四十元。
    “一塘三用”成功了！社管理委员会认真地进行了总结。去年，全社三十四口水塘已有二十三口计十八亩水塘面积，全部养上了鱼，种上了蔬菜，有十五口塘蓄上了“水浮莲”，共收入三千八百五十七元。目前，中共萍乡县委正准备采用参观、展览等办法推广。
