Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 5th: According to Damascus Radio broadcasts, the Lebanese People's Army and government forces engaged in the most intense fighting in the capital, Beirut, in four weeks on the afternoon of the 4th.

The radio said that the fighting started in the Koura-Naba area and then spread to the Basta, Horch, "New Road," and Zaher-Abi-Hedar areas, where government forces used mortars.

According to a report in the Damascus "Al-Nour" newspaper on the 4th, the government forces' artillery shelling of residential areas in Beirut resulted in the destruction of 150 shops.

The "Voice of Free Lebanon Radio" said that government forces again attempted to enter Tripoli and Sidon on the 4th but were repelled by the People's Army. The radio said that this was the tenth time government forces had attempted to enter Sidon. In this battle, four government tanks were destroyed.

According to Damascus newspaper reports, the Lebanese Army Headquarters began recruiting soldiers on the 3rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 5th: According to Damascus Radio broadcasts on the 4th, Christian Maronite bishops from the Lebanese capital Beirut, the southern city of Sidon, and other places held a meeting in Bokki, north of Beirut, on the 4th, presided over by Archbishop Paul Meouchi. They decided to support Archbishop Meouchi's attitude towards the current situation in Lebanon.

Meouchi had expressed opposition to American interference in Lebanon's internal affairs and opposition to the pro-Western government.

Maronite Christians constitute a considerable proportion of the Lebanese population, and this sect has considerable influence on Lebanese political and social life. The current President Chamoun belongs to this sect.

Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: TASS, citing a report from the Cairo "Al-Ahram" correspondent in New York, stated that Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik, who is currently in the United States, has requested the U.S. authorities to immediately intervene in Lebanon's internal affairs to help the Lebanese government suppress the domestic popular uprising.

According to the reporter, Malik, in a meeting with U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles, said that the current situation in Lebanon requires the United States to immediately deploy one or two thousand naval troops to Lebanon. Otherwise, the current government will not be able to maintain power, and the interests of Western countries in Lebanon will suffer "irreparable damage."

The Damascus "Al-Nour" newspaper published an editorial on the 4th, saying that Malik's request "completely conforms to the well-known American espionage mentality and completely conforms to American strategy and the purpose of American official statements."

The newspaper pointed out that the important reason Chamoun is able to continue to hold office is American interference and American aid, which is continuing to increase, bringing death and destruction to the Lebanese people. The newspaper also said that it is for this reason that Arabs today in Lebanon are facing a fierce war directed by American imperialists.

The newspaper pointed out, "The leaders of American imperialism know that it is quite difficult to find a reason to launch a third world war, so they are beginning to create small-scale wars here and there." The newspaper then condemned the American attempt to turn Lebanon into a base for creating wars in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: TASS, citing a report from the Cairo "Al-Shaab" newspaper, stated that the Jordanian government has given the Lebanese government 700,000 dinars. This money will be used to suppress the uprising of the Lebanese people.

　　贝鲁特市区展开激战
    政府军进犯的黎波里和赛伊达受挫
    开罗报纸揭露黎外长在美国求救兵
    据新华社大马士革5日电　据大马士革电台广播，黎巴嫩人民军和政府部队4日下午在首都贝鲁特展开了四星期以来最激烈的战斗。
    电台说，战斗是在考拉斯—纳巴区开始的，随后在巴斯塔、豪尔什、“新路”和扎赫尔—阿比—赫达尔等区进行，政府部队在这些地区使用了迫击炮。
    据大马士革“光明报”4日报道，政府部队在贝鲁特用大炮对居民区轰击的结果，有一百五十家店铺被打毁。
    “自由黎巴嫩之声电台”说，政府部队4日又企图进入的黎波里和赛伊达，但是被人民军击退。电台说，这是政府部队第十次企图进入赛伊达。在这次战斗中，政府部队有四辆坦克被击毁。
    据大马士革报纸消息，黎巴嫩陆军总部在3日开始进行募兵。
    据新华社大马士革5日电　据大马士革电台4日广播，黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特和南部大城市赛伊达以及其他各地方的基督教马罗派主教4日在大主教保罗·迈乌什主持下，在贝鲁特北面的卜克基举行了会议，他们决定支持大主教迈乌什对目前黎巴嫩局势的态度。
    迈乌什曾经表示反对美国干涉黎巴嫩内政，反对亲西方政府。
    马罗派教徒在黎巴嫩居民中占相当大的比例，这个教派在黎巴嫩政治、社会生活中有相当影响。现任总统夏蒙属于这个教派。
    据新华社5日讯　开罗“金字塔报”驻纽约特派记者报道，现在正在美国的黎巴嫩外交部长马利克要求美国当局立即干涉黎巴嫩内政，以便帮助黎巴嫩政府镇压国内的人民起义。
    据这位记者报道，马利克在会见美国中央情报局领导人艾伦·杜勒斯时说，黎巴嫩的当前局势要求美国立刻调动一两千海军部队前往黎巴嫩。不然现在的政府就将不能保住政权，西方国家在黎巴嫩的利益也将受到“不可弥补的打击”。
    大马士革“光明报”4日发表社论说，马利克的要求“完全符合众所周知的美国间谍思想，并且完全符合美国的战略和美国官方声明的目的。”
    报纸指出，夏蒙能够继续执政的重要原因是美国的干涉和美国的援助，这种援助正在继续不断地增加，而给黎巴嫩人民带来死亡和毁灭。这家报纸又说，正是这个原因，阿拉伯人今天在黎巴嫩面临着由美帝国主义分子指挥的激烈的战争。
    报纸指出，“美帝国主义的领导人知道，要找到发动第三次世界大战的理由是相当困难的，因此他们开始在这里和那里制造小规模的战争”。这家报纸接着谴责了美国打算把黎巴嫩变为在中东制造战争的基地的企图。
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社据开罗“人民报”消息，约旦政府给了黎巴嫩政府七十万第纳尔。这笔钱将用来镇压黎巴嫩人民的起义。
