Xinhua News Agency, 15th. After four years of diligent study, 1,900 industrial workers and cadres of worker-peasant origin from all over the country have recently graduated from the worker-peasant rapid middle schools attached to six universities in Beijing. Among these graduates are national and local famous labor models such as Hao Jianxiu, Gao Suxiang, Guo Xiuyun, Ma Chenglin, and Zhang Daozhong.

When the Party and the government sent them to the worker-peasant rapid middle schools four years ago, most of them only had a cultural level of second or third grade of primary school, a few had only studied in private schools for one or two years, and some had only recently removed the label of illiteracy. They stepped into the school gate and studied greedily day and night. Hao Jianxiu, who studied at Renmin University of China, only had a second-grade primary school education when she first entered the school. Algebra was the most difficult subject for Hao Jianxiu. She studied hard when doing exercises, often sweating profusely. Although the answers that her classmates had already done were right next to her, she did not take this shortcut. People were very surprised. Hao Jianxiu said, "It is very easy to copy other people's answers, but this is not your own thing. Only through your own hard work can you never forget it in your life." Hao Jianxiu completed her four years of study with such a tenacious spirit. Ma Chenglin took a total of sixty-two exams in eight semesters. Except for four scores of three, all the others were four and five. Wang Lide, who came from a poor peasant family, had just undergone literacy training in the army before coming to the school. In the first semester, he failed several subjects. He actively looked for the reasons. Later, he came up with a good method: he repeatedly did the math examples taught by the teacher several times, and then tried to solve each exercise in three different ways. This laid a solid foundation, and his grades became better and better. Liu Zhonghui, a labor model in Heilongjiang Province, could not even understand the four arithmetic application problems when he first entered the school. He persevered in his studies with the greatest perseverance. He previewed before class, concentrated his thoughts in class, and thought along with the teacher's lectures. If he could not do the exercises, he would learn from others' strengths in learning and explore the reasons why he could not do them himself. His ability to think independently was strengthened, and his grades improved significantly. In the graduation exam, he got five points in all seven subjects.

In the process of studying, these students have always received the care of the school leaders. The school assigned them better teachers, strengthened individual tutoring for students with learning difficulties, and also held learning experience exchange meetings and made reports on learning methods. Some teachers even lived with them in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the students' difficulties and thoughts.

After graduation, the vast majority of these students will be recommended to universities for further study. Hao Jianxiu and Gao Suxiang will study textile engineering. Ma Chenglin, Liu Zhonghui and others will study industrial enterprise electrification, mechanical manufacturing and other majors respectively.

    经过四年顽强的学习
    郝建秀等将到高等学校继续深造
    新华社15日讯　来自全国各地的一千九百名产业工人和工农出身的干部，经过四年顽强的学习，最近已经分别在北京六个高等学校附设的工农速成中学毕业。在这批毕业生中，有全国和各地著名的劳动模范郝建秀、高素香、郭秀云、马成林、张道中等。
    当党和政府在四年前把他们送到工农速成中学去学习的时候，大部分人只有小学二三年级的文化程度，少数人只在私塾里念过一二年书，有的是不久前才摘去了文盲帽子的劳动人民。他们跨进学校的大门，白天黑夜贪婪地学习。在中国人民大学学习的郝建秀，刚入学时只有小学二年级的文化水平。代数这门课对郝建秀来说是最吃力的，做习题时苦心钻研，常常憋得满头大汗。同学们已经做好的答案虽然就在她的旁边，但是她不走这条捷径，人们很奇怪，郝建秀说：“抄别人的答案，是很容易的，但这不是自己的东西。只有经过自己刻苦钻研出来的，才一辈子也忘不了。”郝建秀就是以这样顽强的精神，完成了四年的学业。马成林八学期中共考了六十二次，除了四个三分以外，其它全是四分和五分。贫农家庭出身的王立德，来校前刚在部队上经过扫盲学习，第一学期有几门课不及格，他积极地寻找原因，以后他想出一个好办法：把老师教的数学例题，反复做上几遍，然后每个习题试着用三种不同的方法去求解，这样打下了巩固的基础，成绩越来越好。黑龙江省工业劳模刘忠惠刚进学校时，连算术的四则应用题也看不懂，他以最大的毅力坚持学习，在课前先预习，上课时思想集中，随着老师的讲课内容去思索。习题作不出来，就去学习别人在学习上的长处和探索自己作不出来的原因。独立思考能力加强了，成绩就有显著的进步，在毕业考试中，七门课他都获得了五分。
    这批学生在学习过程中，始终得到学校领导上的关怀。学校给他们委派了比较优秀的教师，对学习上有困难的学生加强个别辅导，此外还举办学习经验交流会，作学习方法的报告。有些教师为了深入了解学生的困难和思想情况，还同他们住宿在一起。
    这批学生毕业后，绝大多数人将被保送到高等学校去继续深造。郝建秀和高素香将学纺织工程专业。马成林、刘忠惠等将分别学习工业企业电气化、机械制造等专业。
