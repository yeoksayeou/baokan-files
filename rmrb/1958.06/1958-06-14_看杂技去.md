The Shenyang Acrobatic Troupe is a young and vibrant acrobatic troupe that is very appealing. Their performances excellently demonstrate the brave and resourceful spirit of the people and are rich in national characteristics.

Audiences who have seen the Soviet Grand Circus and Soviet acrobatic performances will certainly not forget the wonderful large-scale aerial programs such as the aerialists and trapeze artists. But here, you will also be excited to see that the young actors of the Shenyang Acrobatic Troupe have already quite skillfully mastered these performance techniques. It is also worth mentioning that their interlude comedy performances are very good, and these are the children's most favorite programs. (Shu)

    看杂技去
    沈阳市杂技团是一支充满青春活力、很吸引人的年轻杂技队伍。他们的演出，很好地表现了人民勇敢机智的精神，富有较浓的民族色彩。
    看过苏联大马戏团和苏联杂技表演的观众，一定不会忘记其中那些空中飞人、秋千飞人等精彩的大型空中节目。但在这里，你也将兴奋地看到沈阳市杂技团的青年演员们已经相当熟练地掌握了这些表演技巧。还值得一提的，是他们的幕间滑稽表演很不错，这是孩子们最最喜爱的节目。（树）
