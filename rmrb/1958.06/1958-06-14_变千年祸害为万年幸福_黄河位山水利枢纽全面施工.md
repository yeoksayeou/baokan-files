    Turning a Thousand Years of Calamity into Ten Thousand Years of Happiness
    Comprehensive Construction of the Weishan Water Conservancy Hub on the Yellow River
    (Our Newspaper) According to the Dazhong Daily: The first phase of the Weishan Water Conservancy Hub, one of the important projects for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water hazards and developing its water resources, is under comprehensive construction. More than 80,000 migrant workers and technicians are working day and night on the construction sites of the intake gate, diversion gate, sedimentation basin, and canals.
    The Yellow River Weishan Water Conservancy Hub project is located near Weishan, Dong'a County, Shandong Province. The entire project includes three major components: the Weishan Hub, the Dongping Lake Reservoir, and the main water transmission canal. The hub project includes more than 40 major structures, such as a dam, intake gate, sedimentation basin, floodgate, control gate, diversion gate, and ship lock. The Dongping Lake Reservoir can store 3 billion cubic meters of water. The four main water transmission canals involve 21 counties in the four special districts of Liaocheng, Tai'an, Heze, and Jining. The entire project is expected to be completed by 1960. The first phase of this year's project will complete the Weishan intake gate, the sedimentation basin, the sedimentation basin diversion gate, and the Weishan irrigation area.
    The Yellow River, a mighty river with boundless resources, has been a source of disaster for the people in the past. In the past three thousand years, the Yellow River's lower reaches have breached its banks more than 1,500 times, with 26 major course changes. Each breach and course change has caused the ruin and death of tens of thousands of people. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people along the river have made tremendous efforts to conquer the Yellow River, ensuring that there have been no breaches during the spring thaw, flood season, and autumn floods, thus ensuring the safety of the people along the river. However, because the Yellow River has not been fundamentally controlled, it still poses a great threat to the people along the river every flood season. After the completion of the entire Weishan Water Conservancy Hub project, the Dongping Lake Reservoir can be used to effectively control the serious situation of the once-in-a-thousand-year extraordinary floods of the Yellow River between Sanmenxia and Qinchang meeting the once-in-a-century floods of the Wen River and the Wei Canal above Daokou. It can also store all the Yellow River water during the spring thaw, fundamentally eliminating the threat of floods and ice jams. After the completion of the entire project, it can also divert 780 cubic meters per second of water to irrigate more than 14 million mu of land, and also undertake the important task of water supply and water regulation for the 60 million mu of Yellow River irrigation area in Shandong Province. When this hub project is completed in the future, it will also connect and open up the north-south Grand Canal and the east-west Yellow River shipping traffic, allowing ships of 2,000 to 3,000 tons to travel north to Tianjin and south to the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and restoring navigation on the Linqing to Jining section of the canal, which has been suspended for more than 60 years. It will also allow 700-ton tugboats to travel directly from Lanzhou to the Bohai Sea. While harnessing the Yellow River, a 38,000 kilowatt power station will also be built in the Weishan area using Yellow River water.
    According to the original national plan, the Weishan Hub project was to be constructed in 1959 and completed in 1961. However, in response to the great call of the Party Central Committee to fundamentally change the face of the country in three years of hard work and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, the project builders actively made preparations, and with the approval of the Central Committee, construction started one year ahead of schedule on May 1st. In more than a month, the clearing of the foundation for the Weishan intake gate has been basically completed.

### 变千年祸害为万年幸福  黄河位山水利枢纽全面施工

    变千年祸害为万年幸福
    黄河位山水利枢纽全面施工
    本报讯  据大众日报消息：根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利的重要工程之一——位山水利枢纽第一期工程全面施工。八万多民工和技工，正在进水闸、分水闸、沉沙池和渠道工地上，夜以继日地战斗着。
    黄河位山水利枢纽工程位于山东省东阿县位山附近。整个工程包括位山枢纽、东平湖水库和输水总干渠三大部分。枢纽工程又包括拦河坝、进水闸、沉沙条池、进洪闸、节制闸、分水闸、船闸等四十多个主要建筑物。东平湖水库可蓄水三十亿公方。输水总干渠共四条，渠系涉及聊城、泰安、菏泽、济宁四个专区的二十一个县。全部工程到1960年即可完成。今年第一期工程将完成位山进水闸、沉沙池、沉沙池分水闸和位山灌区四个部分。
    黄河，这支拥有无穷资源的巨流，过去一直是人民的祸害。黄河下游三千年来决口达一千五百多次，重要改道二十六次。每次决口、改道，都要使成千上万的人民家破人亡。解放后在共产党的领导下，沿河人民对征服黄河作了巨大努力，保证了凌、伏、秋汛没有决口，使沿河人民得到了安全。但是，因为黄河还没有根治，每到汛期，还给沿河人民很大威胁。位山水利枢纽工程全部完成后，就可以利用东平湖水库，把三（门）秦（厂）间黄河千年一遇的特大洪水与汶河及卫运河道口以上百年一遇洪水相遭遇的严重情况有效地控制起来，在凌汛期间把黄河水全部蓄起来，从根本上解除洪水和凌汛的威胁。全部工程完成后还可引水七百八十个流量，灌溉一千四百多万亩土地，而且担负山东全省六千万亩黄河灌区的重要的供水与调节用水任务。这个枢纽工程将来建成时，还可沟通、开辟南北大运河和东西黄河的航运交通，使二千到三千吨的船舶北通津沽，南达江淮，使停航六十多年的临清到济宁段运河，重新复航；使七百吨拖轮可从兰州直达渤海。与治理黄河的同时，在位山地区还将利用黄河水兴修三万八千瓩的发电站。
    位山枢纽工程按照国家原计划，是在1959年施工，到1961年完成。但是工程建设者们响应党中央提出的苦干三年基本改变面貌和提前实现全国农业发展纲要的伟大号召，积极进行准备，经中央批准提前一年在5月1日破土开工。一个多月来，位山进水闸清基工程已基本完成。
