　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th—The land reform carried out in Ninglang Yi Autonomous County in the Lesser Liang Mountains, Yunnan Province, by means of peaceful consultation, has recently been completed.

　　More than 26,000 Yi "wa zi" (slaves) who were liberated have become masters of the land. Some "wa zi" were forcibly brought to the Liang Mountains from various places by slave owners in the past. With the help of the People's Government, more than 1,000 people have returned home and reunited with their families. Each person has been allocated three to five mu of arable land. The People's Government has also helped them with a set of farming tools (hoes, machetes, etc.), blankets, clothes, and long blue headscarves. Women have received pleated skirts and sewing kits. Each family has received a complete set of pots, pans, bowls, and sufficient grain and salt. Every three families have received an ox.

　　The liberated slaves have demonstrated astonishing enthusiasm for production. They have been working day and night with other Yi people to build water conservancy projects. In less than two months, the autonomous county has completed water conservancy projects that can irrigate more than 50,000 mu of cultivated land, averaging more than one mu per person, exceeding the planned target. They are also preparing to build water conservancy projects that can irrigate tens of thousands of mu of land. In the past, the Yi people on the Lesser Liang Mountains never planted paddy fields. This year, they are planting rice on a large scale, aiming to increase the yield per mu from 120 jin last year to 450 jin, with a per capita income of more than 500 jin of grain, basically achieving self-sufficiency.

　　In areas where land reform was carried out earlier, more than 10,000 liberated slaves have now joined farms, and more than 2,000 have joined agricultural cooperatives.

　　宁蒗彝族自治县土地改革完成
    两万六千多名奴隶变成土地主人
    新华社昆明9日电　云南省小凉山上宁蒗彝族自治县用和平协商方式所进行的土地改革已在最近完成。
    获得解放的两万六千多名彝族“娃子”（奴隶）变成了土地的主人，有些“娃子”是过去奴隶主用武力从各地抢上凉山的，在人民政府帮助下，有一千多人已回家和亲人团聚。每一个人都分得了三至五亩耕地。人民政府还帮助他们每人一套农具（锄头、砍刀等）、毯子、衣服、蓝布长头巾。妇女们得到了百折裙和针线。每家都得到了一整套锅盘碗盏、足够的粮食和食盐。每三家得到了一头耕牛。
    得到解放的奴隶发挥了惊人的生产积极性。他们夜以继日地和其他的彝族人民一起兴修水利。在不到两个月的时间内，这个自治县就完成了可灌五万多亩耕地的水利工程，平均每人一亩多，超额完成了计划。他们还准备再修可灌几万亩田地的水利工程。过去小凉山上的彝族从不种水田，今年大种水稻，要求粮食亩产量由去年的一百二十斤提高到四百五十斤，每人收入粮食五百斤以上，基本上达到自给。
    土改进行得早的地区，解放了的奴隶现在已有一万多人参加农场，二千多人加入了农业社。
