    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 10th: A delegation from the Indonesian Communist Party, led by General Secretary D.N. Aidit, left Jakarta by plane on the 10th to attend the 11th National Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the 5th Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party. The members of the delegation are Rewang and Suradi.
    Before his departure, Aidit issued a written statement calling on all Indonesian people to do their utmost to strengthen unity and cooperation between the people, the army, and the government in order to defeat all conspiracies of the imperialists and their servants. Aidit pointed out that the imperialists, headed by the United States, are now trying every means to destroy this cooperation.
    Aidit said that the recent American aggression against Indonesia has failed, which once again proves that the strength of the imperialists is limited, that imperialism has indeed become decadent and is collapsing. On the other hand, it proves that the strength of the people is infinite and is growing day by day.
    Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party unswervingly and resolutely implements the policy of combining patriotism and proletarian internationalism. He said that patriotism and proletarian internationalism are inseparable. Patriotism is only complete when it is combined with proletarian internationalism.
    Aidit said that the working people and the Communist Party of Indonesia recognize that only by relying on the cooperation of the working people and all nations of the world, especially the militant cooperation of the world working class, can we smash monopoly capitalism, which is international in nature.
    In his statement, Aidit finally called on the people to unite around the correct leadership of the long-tested Central Committee and Political Bureau of the Communist Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 11th: The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union announced on the 10th that after Prime Minister Djuanda and the National Committee of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union issued statements condemning the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union had received letters and telegrams from trade unions and peace committees in many countries, all expressing support for these statements.

    艾地号召印度尼西亚人民加强团结
    击败帝国主义阴谋
    据新华社雅加达10日电　由总书记艾地率领的印度尼西亚共产党代表团10日乘飞机离开雅加达，启程前往参加捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次全国代表大会和德国统一社会党第五次全国代表大会。团员是雷旺和苏拉迪。
    艾地在起程前发表了一篇书面声明，号召全体印度尼西亚人民竭尽全力来加强人民、军队和政府之间的团结和合作，以便击败帝国主义分子和他们的仆从的一切阴谋。艾地指出，以美国为首的帝国主义者现在正在千方百计地阴谋摧毁这种合作。
    艾地说，美国最近对印度尼西亚的侵略已经失败，这又一次证明了帝国主义者的力量是有限的，帝国主义的确已经变得腐朽，并且正在崩溃，而另一方面，这证明了人民的力量是无穷的，并且正在日益增长。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党始终不渝地坚决执行把爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义相结合的方针。他说，爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义是不能分开的。爱国主义只有同无产阶级国际主义相结合才是完善的。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚的劳动人民和共产党认识到，只有依靠全世界劳动人民和各民族的合作，首先是依靠世界工人阶级的战斗性合作，才能粉碎具有国际性质的垄断资本主义。
    艾地在声明中最后号召人民团结在久经考验的共产党中央委员会和政治局的正确领导的周围。
    据新华社雅加达11日电　全印度尼西亚中央职工会10日宣布，在朱安达总理和全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国委员会发表声明谴责美国和蒋介石集团干涉印度尼西亚内政以后，全印度尼西亚中央职工会曾经收到了很多国家的工会和和平委员会发出的信件和电报，都表示支持这些声明。
