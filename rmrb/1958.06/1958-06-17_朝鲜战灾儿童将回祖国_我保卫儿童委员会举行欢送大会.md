Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th – To bid farewell to the Korean war orphans who have been cared for in China as they return to their homeland, the delegation of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children held a grand farewell ceremony today at the Friendship Palace in Shenyang.

Among those attending the farewell ceremony from the Chinese side were the head of the delegation of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children to bid farewell to the Korean war orphans, Shen Zijiu, member of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children, the deputy head of the delegation, Li Qing, deputy director of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Chen Rui, deputy director of the Jilin Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Ma Bingzheng, deputy director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, all members of the delegation, as well as Zhang Panxin, secretary-general and director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, and more than 600 representatives from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City. From the Korean side were Kim Yong-bin, the Consul General of North Korea in Shenyang, Kim Yong-am, deputy director of the North Korean Children's Education Department, and more than 70 people including the heads of the North Korean orphan schools in the three northeastern provinces and student representatives.

In her farewell speech, delegation head Shen Zijiu first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children and sincerely congratulated the presidents of the North Korean academies and the war orphans on returning to their motherland to participate in the glorious cause of socialist construction. She went on to say that the Chinese people have always believed that the happiness of the Korean people is their own happiness, and the suffering of the Korean people is their own suffering. Therefore, when some Korean children were deprived of their parents by the American aggressors and came to China, our people raised them as their own children. Now, it is especially gratifying that over the years they have grown up in China and have received certain cultural education and technical training under the leadership of the North Korean Children's Education Department, and can serve the construction of their own country.

She said that the war orphans are worthy of being good sons and daughters of the heroic Korean people. During their time in China, they not only diligently participated in study and labor, but also carried out many activities beneficial to Sino-Korean friendship in their spare time, demonstrated a great spirit of internationalism, and displayed the virtue of hard work.

After her speech, delegation head Shen Zijiu presented a banner embroidered with "May Sino-Korean Friendship Last Forever" to the North Korean Children's Education Department on behalf of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children. The entire audience stood up and applauded warmly at this moment. Subsequently, the director and deputy director of the North Korean Children's Education Department and staff, representatives of North Korean orphans, and representatives of North Korean teachers and staff working in North Korean orphan schools received gifts, commemorative albums, and commemorative badges presented by the China National Committee for the Defence of Children.

Kim Yong-am, the deputy director of the North Korean Children's Education Department, delivered a reply speech amidst warm applause. On behalf of the North Korean Children's Education Department and all teachers and staff of the schools, as well as all the orphans, he expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their friendship in nurturing the North Korean war orphans. He said that the orphaned children of Korean patriotic martyrs and war orphans have been living happily in the embrace of the fraternal Chinese people for six years. During this period, the great Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China, as well as the entire Chinese people, have cared for them like their own children. He expressed that he would always remember the profound friendship of the Chinese people. He said that all the Korean people and the Korean orphans who have grown up in the embrace of the 600 million Chinese people will always be loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism and will forever advance together with the Chinese people.

After the farewell ceremony, the guests watched the wonderful acrobatics performed by the Shenyang Acrobatic Troupe. Before the farewell ceremony, delegation head Shen Zijiu held a grand banquet to bid farewell to the Korean war orphans returning home.

The sub-delegations of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces to bid farewell to the Korean war orphans will also conduct farewell activities in cities and counties with North Korean orphan schools.
