Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th: The Pyongyang newspapers today published an important speech made by Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, on the 11th at the third session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea regarding North Korea's first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961).

Kim Il-sung said that the basic task of North Korea's first Five-Year Plan is to further consolidate the socialist economic foundation in the northern part of the Republic and basically solve the people's problems of food, clothing, and housing. In order to achieve this task, it is necessary to continue to thoroughly implement the economic policy of the Korean Workers' Party of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture.

Kim Il-sung said that during the Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value will increase by more than 1.6 times. The total value of industrial products in 1961 will greatly exceed the total of the three years from 1954 to 1956. By 1961, the amount of industrial products that can be distributed to each person in northern North Korea on a per capita basis will reach a fairly high level: each person can be allocated 970 kilowatt-hours of electricity, one ton of coal, 90 kilograms of iron, 68 kilograms of steel, 64 kilograms of chemical fertilizers, 200 kilograms of cement, 20 meters of textiles, and 65 kilograms of fish.

By 1961, the proportion of industrial output value in the total output value of industry and agriculture will increase from 46.7% in 1949 and 60% in 1956 to 70%. The proportion of the production of means of production in the total industrial output value will reach 61.3%, thus completely eliminating the colonial bias and technical backwardness in industry and further strengthening the independent foundation of industry.

Kim Il-sung said that the total agricultural output value in 1961 will double that of 1956, of which grain output will increase by 31%. As a result of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, North Korea's agriculture will not only be able to fully solve the grain problem, but also have a considerable amount of surplus grain, and will also be transformed into a diversified economy capable of supplying a considerable amount of meat, abundant fruits, and raw materials for the textile industry. He emphasized the need to develop water conservancy irrigation, especially dryland irrigation. He said that during the first Five-Year Plan period, 600,000 chongbo (approximately 15 mu per chongbo) of paddy fields and 700,000 chongbo of drylands out of the 2 million chongbo of arable land in northern North Korea should be irrigated, so that agriculture can be guaranteed a bumper harvest all year round.

Kim Il-sung said that if the problem to be solved during the three-year plan after the war was to restore the destroyed factories and mines and restore industrial and agricultural production to the pre-war level, then the problem to be solved during the five-year plan was to expand the existing factories, carry out technical transformation, and build new factories to raise industrial and agricultural production to a new level. He pointed out that it can be said that North Korea's national economy has since entered a period of technical transformation, which is a huge transformation in North Korea's economic development and people's lives. Kim Il-sung said that socialist relations of production have achieved a decisive victory in North Korea's industry, agriculture and all economic sectors. Compared with 1949, the proportion of the socialist economy in industry increased from 90.7% to 98.7%, and the proportion of commodity retail sales increased from 56.5% to 87.9%. Now, more than 98.6% of farmers in northern North Korea have been cooperativized. During the Five-Year Plan period, the cooperativization of agriculture and the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises will be completed, and all forms of exploitation will be eliminated. Kim Il-sung said that the basic completion of this great revolutionary change will open up a brilliant road for the rapid development of productive forces.

Kim Il-sung emphasized that today, North Korea's socialist relations of production have been basically established, but the socialist material and production foundation is still very weak. Under such circumstances, technical transformation has been put forward as the most urgent task.

Kim Il-sung said that during the first Five-Year Plan period, a solid foundation for socialist industrialization should be laid and technical transformation should be carried out gradually. During the second Five-Year Plan period, socialist industrialization will be further promoted, all economic sectors will be re-equipped with modern technology, and the material and technical foundation for large-scale basic construction will be laid.

Kim Il-sung said that during the Five-Year Plan period, the people's living standards will greatly exceed those before the war. At the same time, accumulation and consumption must be rationally arranged. He said that the Korean Workers' Party has consistently adhered to the principle of rapidly increasing accumulation to ensure the strengthening of the economic foundation and at the same time increasing consumption to meet the current needs of the people's lives. In the future, it is necessary to increase consumption simultaneously on the basis of systematically increasing accumulation.

Kim Il-sung finally emphasized that many difficulties will be encountered in the process of implementing the first Five-Year Plan, but the North Korean people, who have been tested by the war and the post-war recovery period and are closely united around the Korean Workers' Party, will certainly be able to complete this glorious plan. He said that the development of socialist construction and the establishment of an independent economic foundation in northern North Korea will encourage the people of southern North Korea in their struggle against American imperialism and the Lee Seung-man clique and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    金日成谈五年计划基本任务
    进一步巩固社会主义经济基础
    基本上解决人民的衣食住问题
    新华社平壤12日电　平壤报纸今天刊载了朝鲜内阁首相金日成11日在朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第三次会议上就朝鲜第一个五年计划（1957年—1961年）发表的重要讲话。
    金日成说，朝鲜第一个五年计划的基本任务是：进一步巩固共和国北部的社会主义经济基础，基本上解决人民的衣食住问题。为了实现这个任务，要继续贯彻执行朝鲜劳动党的优先发展重工业、同时发展轻工业和农业的经济政策。
    金日成说，在五年计划期间，工业总产值将增加一点六倍以上。1961年的工业产品总值将大大超过1954年到1956年三年的总和。到1961年，朝鲜北部按人数平均每人可以分配到的工业产品的数量将达到相当高的水平：每人可分配到九百七十度电、一吨煤、九十公斤铁、六十八公斤钢、六十四公斤化学肥料、二百公斤水泥、二十公尺纺织品和六十五公斤鱼类。
    到1961年，工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重将由1949年的46.7％和1956年的60％增加到70％。生产资料的生产在工业总产值中的比重将达到61.3％，这样就将完全消除工业中的殖民地偏颇现象和技术落后的情况，进一步加强工业的独立基础。
    金日成说，1961年的农业总产值将比1956年增加一倍，其中，粮食产量增加31％。第一个五年计划执行的结果，朝鲜的农业将不仅能够充分解决粮食问题，而且有相当数量的余粮，同时还将转变成为能够供应相当数量的肉类、丰富的水果和纺织工业原料的多种经济。他强调要发展水利灌溉，特别是旱田灌溉。他说，在第一个五年计划期间，要使朝鲜北部二百万町步（每町步约合十五市亩）耕地中的六十万町步水田和七十万町步旱田能够受到灌溉，使农业能够常年保证丰收。
    金日成说，如果说战后三年计划期间需要解决的问题是恢复遭到破坏的厂矿企业，使工农业生产恢复到战前水平的话，五年计划期间需要解决的问题就是扩建原有的工厂，进行技术改造，并且建设新的工厂，把工农业生产提高到新的水平。他指出，可以说朝鲜人民经济从此进入了技术改造的时期，这是朝鲜经济发展和人民生活中的巨大转变。金日成说，社会主义生产关系已经在朝鲜北部的工业、农业和所有经济部门中取得了决定性的胜利。1957年同1949年相比，社会主义经济在工业中占的比重由90.7％增加到98.7％，商品零售业由56.5％增加到87.9％。现在，朝鲜北部有98.6％以上的农户已经合作化。在五年计划期间，要完成农业合作化和私营工商业的改造，消灭一切剥削形式。金日成说，这个伟大的革命变革的基本完成，将为迅速发展生产力开拓光辉的道路。
    金日成强调说，今天，朝鲜的社会主义生产关系已经基本确立，但是社会主义物质的和生产的基础还很薄弱，在这种情况下，进行技术改造就作为最迫切的任务被提出来了。
    金日成说，在第一个五年计划期间，要牢固地打下社会主义工业化的基础，逐渐地进行技术改造。在第二个五年计划期间，将进一步促进社会主义工业化，以现代化的技术重新装备所有的经济部门，奠定进行大规模基本建设的物质、技术基础。
    金日成说，五年计划期间，人民的生活水平将大大超过战前。同时，对积累和消费要加以合理的安排。他说，朝鲜劳动党在战后一贯坚持迅速增加积累以保证经济基础的加强，同时增加消费以满足人民生活当前需要的原则。今后必须在系统地增加积累的基础上，同时增加消费。
    金日成最后强调说，在执行第一个五年计划的过程中将会遇到许多困难，但是经过战争和战后恢复时期考验的朝鲜人民，紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党的周围，一定能够完成这个光辉的计划。他说，朝鲜北部社会主义建设的发展和独立经济基础的建立，将鼓舞朝鲜南部人民反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团以及争取和平统一祖国的斗争。
