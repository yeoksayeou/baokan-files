　　Eliminate the Three Categories of Weak Seedlings; One Crop Equals Two
　　Guangxi and Hunan Strive for a Bumper Early Rice Harvest
　　(Our Dispatch) Guangxi is carrying out a “one crop equals two” production increase campaign to strive for a bumper early rice harvest. After strengthening field management and vigorously eliminating the three categories of weak seedlings, most of the early rice is growing sturdily, a lush green, and the few weak seedlings have turned from yellow to green, showing signs of prosperity. In Rong County, where the season is earlier, the early rice has already begun to head and flower.
　　In the previous period, Guangxi achieved great victories in fighting drought, transplanting rice seedlings, and protecting seedlings from drought. Early rice transplanting has completed 86% of this year's planting plan, an increase of more than one million mu compared to last year. In order to make up for losses caused by the drought and strive for a bumper early rice harvest, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee proposed: "Reduce acreage but not yield, ensure a bumper harvest even without rain," and universally launched an ultra-high yield campaign of "eliminating the three categories of weak seedlings; one crop equals two," requiring that the yield of early rice be increased to reach the harvest of last year's early and late crops combined.
　　In order to complete the ultra-high yield task, the entire region, from top to bottom, carried out ideological mobilization, universally conducting inspections, appraisals, and great debates. Through inspection and debate, the "early rice is a foregone conclusion" and blindly optimistic ideas existing among cadres and the masses were criticized and corrected, and the content of field management was clarified. Therefore, the ultra-high yield campaign of "eliminating the three categories of weak seedlings; one crop equals two" unfolded vigorously.
　　While eliminating the three categories of weak seedlings, all localities also paid attention to eliminating pests. Due to the drought, many places experienced varying degrees of damage from rice stem borers. All localities universally adopted methods such as "one person, two torches" to lure and kill the pests in a concentrated effort. For example, in Rong County, rice stem borers and other pests have been basically eliminated within a few days.

　　(Our Dispatch) Under the brilliant light of the General Line, farmers in various parts of Hunan are seizing the opportunity to carry out intensive cultivation and topdressing of early rice, striving for a bumper harvest. In recent days, taking advantage of the good opportunity after the long rain, more than 13 million commune members have been rushing to work every day. After some effort, more than 20 million mu of early rice is lush and green, generally growing well. In some areas of southern and eastern Hunan, where the season is earlier, the early rice is already more than two feet tall, beginning to fill out, and some have already begun to form ears.
　　At present, most of the early rice in the province is in the tillering stage, requiring sufficient nutrients and sunlight. All localities are seizing the opportunity to rush through intensive cultivation, topdressing, and pest control day and night to promote the tillering and growth of rice seedlings. At present, early rice throughout the province has generally been cultivated and topdressed once, and Xiangtan, Chenxian and other areas have been cultivated and topdressed twice.
　　This year, although the area planted with early rice in Hunan Province was attacked by a heavy rain, it was still over-fulfilled according to the original plan, an increase of more than 8 million mu compared to last year. Therefore, striving for a bumper early rice harvest will play a decisive role in ensuring that the province completes this year's grain production increase plan. (Hu Jian)

### 消灭三类禾　一造顶两造  广西湖南努力争取早稻大丰收

　　消灭三类禾　一造顶两造
    广西湖南努力争取早稻大丰收
    本报讯　广西开展“一造顶两造”增产运动争取早稻大丰收。经过加强田间管理和大力消灭三类禾以后，大部早稻生长茁壮，一片葱绿，少数三类禾已由黄转青，欣欣向荣。季节较早的容县专区，早稻已孕穗开花。
    广西前一时期抗旱插秧和抗旱保苗取得很大胜利，早稻插秧已完成今年种植计划86％，比去年扩大了一百多万亩。为了弥补受旱损失，争取早稻丰收，中共广西僮族自治区党委提出：“减亩不减收，无雨保丰收”，普遍开展“消灭三类禾，一造顶两造”的超额增产运动，要求把早稻产量提高，达到去年早晚两造的收成。
    为了完成超额增产任务，全区自上而下的进行了思想动员，普遍开展了检查、评比和大辩论，通过检查和辩论，批判与纠正了干部和群众中存在的“早稻已成定局”和盲目乐观思想，明确了田间管理的内容，因而“消灭三类禾，一造顶两造”的超额增产运动蓬勃展开。
    在消灭三类禾的同时，各地还注意了消灭虫害，因天旱，很多地方发生程度不同的螟虫为害，各地普遍采取“一人二把火”诱杀等法突击消灭虫害。如容县专区几天之内稻螟等害虫已基本捕灭。

    本报讯　在总路线的光芒照耀下，湖南各地农民正抓紧早稻的中耕追肥工作，努力争取丰收。连日以来，趁久雨新晴这个大好时机，每天突击出工的有一千三百多万社员，经过一番努力之后，两千多万亩早稻已是青葱满田垅，一般生长良好。季节较早的湘南、湘东部分地区，早稻已有两尺多高，开始满行圆脚，有的已经怀苞抽穗了。
    目前，全省大部分早稻正处在分蘖时期，需要充足的养份和阳光。各地正抓紧日夜突击中耕、追肥和除虫，促进禾苗分蘖成长。现在，全省早稻一般中耕追肥一次，湘潭、郴县等专区已中耕追肥两次。
    今年，湖南省早稻种植面积虽经过一场大雨的袭击，仍按原计划超额完成，比去年增加八百多万亩。因此，争取早稻丰收，对保证全省完成今年粮食增产计划，将起决定作用。（胡坚）
