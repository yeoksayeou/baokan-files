　　Yanbian Discovers Large Copper Mine
    (Our Report) The Yanbian Geological Team has discovered a very promising disseminated veinlet-type copper mine in the deep mountains and dense forests of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province. This copper mine mainly occurs in hornfels and quartz diorite. The main metallic minerals in the ore are chalcopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, and pyrrhotite. Here, rich ore bodies have also been found, located in low-lying areas very conducive to structurally controlled mineralization. At the same time, anomalous zones for copper metal content measurement have been discovered. Therefore, this mining area is a very promising mining area.

　　延边发现大铜矿
    本报讯  延边地质大队在吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的深山密林中发现了一个非常有远景的细脉浸染型的铜矿。这个铜矿主要生在角岩和石英闪长岩中，在矿石中主要金属矿有黄铜矿，黄铁矿，辉钼矿，及磁黄铁矿等。在这里，还找到了富矿体，富矿体生在非常有利于构造控制成矿的低洼部位。同时发现了金属量测量铜的异常区。因此，这个矿区是个非常有远景的矿区。
