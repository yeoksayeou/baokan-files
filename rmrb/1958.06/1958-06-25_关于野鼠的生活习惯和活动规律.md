On the Living Habits and Activity Patterns of Wild Rats
By Cao Yixiu, of the Dai ethnic group

    House Rats and Wild Rats

    Rats can spread plague, ruin crops, steal grain, damage clothing, destroy buildings and water conservancy projects, causing great harm. To eliminate rats, it is not enough to eliminate the rats in our homes; we must also eliminate the rats in the wild. Because wild rats can also migrate into homes. If we only eliminate house rats and not wild rats, the success of eliminating rats from our homes cannot be consolidated; the crops in the fields and water conservancy projects will inevitably suffer from rats; and the root cause of the plague cannot be eradicated.

    There are many ways to eliminate rats in the wild, among which digging is the most suitable method for the masses. Because as long as you have a hoe, you can dig for rats.

    The Process of Mastering Wild Rat Living Habits

    From 1951 to now, for eight years, I have eliminated a total of 10,663 rats, most of which were captured by digging. At first, when digging for wild rats, I often came up empty because I had no experience and dug at every hole I saw. Once, when I was digging a rat hole, I dug very deep but didn't see a rat, so I stopped hoeing and observed the surrounding situation. As a result, I found a small rat that couldn't run very far away, and near it was a hole that connected to the one I was digging. Then I realized: the reason I didn't dig up a rat was that while I was digging here, its parents had already led the other young rats to escape from the back door, and the remaining one was the smallest and too weak to run. This was my first discovery that rats also have back doors. Another time, I saw others digging for rats, and they couldn't dig them up either. At this time, I saw that the grass nearby was growing very well, except for a small patch that was completely withered. I poked it with a stick and found that these withered grasses were growing on very thin soil, and below the soil was a rat hole. When I dug it open, I found that several rats were hiding inside to take refuge. From this time on, I learned that rats also have hidden holes for refuge. Since then, before digging for wild rats, I always first look at the situation of the hole, and then look at the surrounding situation; while digging, I use my hands to feel if the hole has split; after digging, I think about why this hole has rats, and that hole doesn't. Over time, after digging more, I gained some understanding of the habits and patterns of wild rats.

    Wild Rat Habitats, Reproduction, and Relocation

    The places where wild rats live are related to the terrain. Generally speaking, rat holes are more common in dry places near water, with lots of weeds and small bushes. The entrances are mostly in sunny places, near the upper edge of field ridges, or near the banks of irrigation ditch walls, in order to facilitate sunbathing and allow warm air to flow in, and to avoid flooding. Places that are low-lying, damp, and prone to flooding, shady places where the sun doesn't shine, and places that are bare and far from water, rarely have rat holes. Therefore, when looking for rat holes, the terrain must be considered.

    Wild rats reproduce in all seasons of the year, but the most reproduction occurs in April to June and September to October each year. During these two periods, seven or eight out of ten nests dug will have young rats. Each nest usually has six or seven young rats, with a maximum of twelve and a minimum of three or four. The reason why wild rats reproduce the most in spring and autumn is that spring has small spring crops maturing, and autumn has rice maturing. When crops mature, rats not only have food to eat, but also there is no water in the fields, making it easy to dig holes, build nests, live, and reproduce.

    Rats also relocate mostly in spring and autumn. When crops are about to mature, some of the rats in homes move to the fields. When the crops are harvested, and plowing and watering begin, rats move to villages, houses, haystacks, high banks, river dikes, foothills, bamboo forests, and bushes. This is partly because they follow the transfer of grain, and partly because they are afraid of flooding.

    Therefore, if we can mobilize everyone to dig for wild rats in spring and autumn, we will surely achieve great results. If we wait until the young rats have dispersed before eliminating them, it will take more effort. At the same time, when searching for rat holes, we must also go to different places according to different seasons in order to eliminate more rats.

    Rat Hole Structure and Identification

    The structure of a rat hole is very complex, often with more than one entrance. The most common is a front and back entrance, with more loose soil at the front entrance and less or no loose soil at the back entrance. Some back entrances are very inconspicuous, or not completely open, and still have a thin layer of soil covering them, but the grass on the soil is withered because the roots have been bitten off. This back entrance is the hidden hole, where they first hide when attacked by "enemies," and when they can't hide anymore, they can escape with a vigorous rush. The back entrance of a rat hole on a field ridge may open on the other side of the ridge when the ridge is thin; when the ridge is thick, the front and back entrances are mostly on the same side of the ridge. The distance between the front and back entrances is generally only one to two feet apart, and the furthest is no more than five feet. The back entrance of a rat hole on an irrigation ditch wall often leads to the fields on the bank, and is sometimes difficult to find. Because the sizes of various rats are different, the sizes of the entrances are also different, some as big as eggs, and some as thin as thumbs. The structure of the hole is very complex, winding and turning, often dividing into three to five forks, leading to its granary, grass nest, back hole, or hidden hole. Therefore, when looking for rat holes, it is necessary to find not only the front hole, but also the back hole and hidden hole. When digging, the back hole and hidden hole should also be blocked first, and then dig inward from the front hole. At the same time, while digging, we must constantly use our hands to explore the direction of the rat hole, whether there are forks, so as not to miss the hidden holes and let them escape.

    There is a pile of loose soil at the entrance of a rat hole, which is an important sign for discovering rat holes. Another important target is the rat path. Rats often have a certain place to travel to and from, especially on the walls of ditches and the edges of rice fields that have just been drained. Following the rat path can lead to the rat hole. The rat path is the footprint of rats stepping on it when they travel frequently. It consists of many rows of small pits, like holes poked with a match head.

    After finding the hole, it is necessary to distinguish whether it is a real rat hole or a fake rat hole. Because there is a type of stinging large ant hole that is about the same size as a small wild rat hole, but the loose soil particles at the entrance of the large ant hole are very fine, about the size and shape of millet grains. The loose soil particles at the entrance of a rat hole are generally the size of rice grains, and a few are the size of peas or millet grains. Because when rats dig holes, they bite with their mouths and use their front and back paws to dig, roll, and knead the soil, the shape of the soil particles is irregular and round, and the surface is somewhat smooth, so it is clear at a glance that this is not an ordinary pile of small soil that has collapsed.

    How to Judge Whether There are Rats and How Many Rats There Are

    After finding a rat hole, it is also necessary to judge whether there are rats inside. The method of judgment is: if there are very fine spider silks or patches of spider webs at the entrance of the hole; the entrance of the hole is not neat or smooth; small grass sprouts have grown at the entrance of the hole; there are still dew drops on the weeds at the entrance of the hole in the morning; there are no fresh footprints of rats at the entrance of the hole; or the loose soil at the entrance of the hole is very old, etc., these phenomena indicate that rats have not been in and out for a long time, and there are no rats in the hole. If there is new soil at the entrance of the hole, but the amount is very small, it means that this hole is being dug and is not very deep. The rats come here to work at night and rarely stay inside during the day. Sometimes you can see leftover grain husks at the entrance of the hole, and there are also fresh rat footprints, but the loose soil at the entrance of the hole is very old. This proves that the rats are resting and eating inside, but they do not live in the hole, so there are no rats inside during the day. A hole that is very smooth, but the loose soil at the entrance is very old, is often an old rat hole occupied by snakes or frogs. Only if the entrance of the hole is smooth, the loose soil outside the hole is plentiful (one to two bowls) and fresh, without spider silks (webs), and without small grass sprouts that have just emerged from the soil, etc., are there definitely rats in the hole.

    Determining that there are rats in the hole, how do you know how many rats there are? If there is a lot of fresh soil at the entrance (one bowl to one liter), and the entrance is blocked with loose soil, there must be a nest of old and young rats inside, with a minimum of four to five and a maximum of a dozen. Because after rats give birth, they often enter and exit from a very hidden back hole, or eat stored food in the hole for several days without coming out, and block the hole to prevent snakes or other enemies from discovering and attacking. If the mother rat runs out when digging for the first time, you can also judge how many rats are in the hole by observing it. If the mother rat's nipples are swollen, it proves that there must be young rats in the hole. And the number of swollen nipples can also determine the number of young rats in the hole. If the young rats obtained are less than the swollen nipples, you should continue to dig to avoid omissions. If only young rats are dug up in a nest, you should continue to dig, as the adult rats are often at home as well.

    If there is not much fresh soil at the entrance of the hole, and the entrance is not blocked with loose soil, it proves that only one or two adult rats live there, and there will be no young rats. There is grass around the entrance of the hole that has been bitten off by rats, indicating that the rats are gathering grass to build a nest in preparation for giving birth, so there are only adult rats and no young rats.

    When digging for rats, in addition to the above, it is also necessary to be vigilant against rats running out, and eliminate one as soon as it comes out. If you have dug up the rat's grass nest, you can feel it with your hand. If it feels warm, there must be rats. Sometimes a nest of rats is forced to the back hole or hidden hole, and you should be determined to dig to the end. (Originally published in Yunnan Daily, slightly abridged by this newspaper.

    关于野鼠的生活习惯和活动规律
    傣族　曹依秀
    家鼠和野鼠
    老鼠会传播痒子病（鼠疫），糟蹋庄稼，偷吃粮食，咬坏衣物，破坏建筑物和水利建设，害处很大。要消灭老鼠，光把家里面的老鼠消灭了还不行，必须要连野外的老鼠也一起消灭。因为，在野外的老鼠，也可迁移到家里来住。光除尽了家鼠，而不除掉野鼠，家里的无鼠成绩，就不能巩固；田里的庄稼和水利工程也免不掉老鼠的祸害；痒子病的祸根就不能挖掉。
    野外灭鼠的方法很多，其中挖捕的方法，最适用于广大群众。因为只要有一把锄头，就可以进行挖鼠。
    掌握野鼠生活习性的经过 
    从1951年到现在，八年来，我共消灭了一万零六百六十三只老鼠，绝大部分都是用挖捕的方法捕获的。最初挖捕野鼠时，因为没有经验，见洞就挖，常常落空。有一次，我挖一个鼠洞时，挖了很深，但是不见老鼠，我就停下锄头，观察周围的情况。结果，发现在不远的地方有一只不大会跑的小老鼠，在它的附近有一个洞口，这个洞与我正在挖的那个洞是相通的。于是我才知道：没有挖到老鼠的原因，是我在这边挖，它的爹娘已经领着其他幼鼠从后门逃跑了，剩下的这一只，是最小而弱跑不动的。这就是我第一次发现老鼠还有后洞口的经过。还有一次，我看别人挖老鼠，他们也挖不着。这时，我看到附近的草长的都很好，只有一小片草完全枯死了。我就用棍子捣了一下，才发现这些枯草长在很薄的土上，土层下面是一个老鼠洞。挖开一看，原来有好几只老鼠躲在里面避难。从这一次起，我才知道老鼠还有避难的暗洞。从此以后，我在挖野鼠之前，总要先看看洞口的情况，再看看附近周围的情况；边挖边用手摸摸，看洞分岔了没有？挖完了之后，再想想为什么这个洞有老鼠，那个洞又没有老鼠。时间长了，挖的多了，我就摸到了一些有关野鼠的习性和规律。
    野鼠的住地、繁殖和搬家
    野鼠居住的地方与地形有关。一般来说，野鼠的洞多在干而近水、杂草多、小树丛生的地方。洞口多在向阳处，田埂近上缘处，或灌溉沟壁的近岸处，这是为了便于晒太阳让暖气流入，而且避免水淹到的缘故。凡是低凹潮湿和水能淹到的地方，太阳晒不着的背阴地方，光秃无草和离水太远的地方，就很少有鼠洞。所以找鼠洞时，要考虑到地形。
    野鼠一年四季都有繁殖生育，但繁殖最多是在每年的4至6月和9至10月。在这两个期间，挖十窝就有七至八窝有幼鼠。每窝的幼鼠一般是六、七个，最多十二个，最少也有三、四个。野鼠在春秋二季繁殖最多的原因，是春季有小春作物成熟，秋季稻谷又成熟了。庄稼成熟的时候，老鼠不但有吃的，而且田地中没有水了，也好打洞、做窝、居住、生育。
    老鼠的搬家，也多在春秋二季。庄稼快要成熟的时候，家里的老鼠有些就搬到田野里去了。等到庄稼收割完毕，犁田、放水的时候，老鼠又多搬到村寨屋内，草堆中，高坎、高埂和河坝上，山脚下和竹林、树丛中。这一方面是它跟着粮食的转移而转移，另一方面是怕水淹。
    所以，我们如果能够在春秋二季人人动手挖捕野鼠，一定可以收到很大的效果。如果等幼鼠分散以后，再来消灭，就要花更大的力气。同时，寻找鼠洞时，也要根据不同的季节，到不同的地方去找，才能消灭更多的老鼠。
    鼠洞的构造和识别
    老鼠洞的构造很复杂，常常不只一个洞口，最常见的是前后二洞，前洞洞口有较多的松土，后洞则很少或没有松土。有的后洞很不明显，或者没有完全打通，还留着一层薄土盖着，但土上的草因为根被咬断了，所以都枯死了。这后洞就是暗洞，当它受到“敌人”侵害时，首先躲在这里避难，等躲不住的时候，用力猛一冲，就可逃脱。田埂上的鼠洞，当埂子薄时，后洞可能是在埂的另一面开口；埂子厚的时候，前后洞口多在埂的一面。前后洞口的距离，一般只有一到二尺远，最远的也不过五尺左右。灌溉沟壁上的鼠洞，后洞常常通到岸上的田地边去，有时很不好找。由于各种老鼠的身体大小不同，所以洞口的大小也不同，有的有鸡蛋那末大，有的只有大拇指头那末粗。洞的构造很复杂，里面弯弯曲曲，常常分成三至五道岔路，通向它的粮仓、草窝、后洞或暗洞去。所以，找鼠洞时，不但要找到前洞，而且要连后洞、暗洞一起找到。在挖的时候，也要先把后洞、暗洞一起堵住，然后从前洞向里挖。同时，在挖的时候，还要不断地用手去探索鼠洞的方向，有没有分岔，以免遗漏了暗洞等叫它躲了过去。
    鼠洞口都有一堆松土，这是发现鼠洞的重要标志。还有一个重要目标就是鼠道，老鼠来往常有一定的地方，尤其是水沟壁和才放干水不久的稻田边容易看到。顺着鼠道追踪就可以找到鼠洞。鼠道是老鼠经常来往时脚爪踏上的脚印子，是很多成排而细小的窝窝，好像用火柴头戳上的洞洞一样。
    找到洞以后，要辨别是真鼠洞，还是假鼠洞。因为有一种会刺人的大蚂蚁洞，和小点的野鼠洞大小差不多，但大蚂蚁洞口的松土颗粒很细，大小形状与小米粒差不多。而老鼠洞口松土的颗粒，一般都有大米粒那么大，少数有豌豆那么大或小米粒那么小。因为老鼠挖洞时，用嘴咬和用前后爪扒土，连滚带揉，土的颗粒形状已呈不规则的圆形，表面弄的有些光滑了，所以一望可知这不是一般蹋下来的小土堆。
    怎样判断有鼠无鼠和鼠多鼠少
    找到鼠洞以后，还要判断里面有鼠无鼠。判断的方法是：如果洞口有很细的蜘蛛丝，或有成片的蜘蛛网；洞口不整齐、不光滑；洞口长了小草芽；早晨洞口的杂草上仍有露水珠；洞口没有老鼠走的新鲜脚迹；或洞口松土已很陈旧，等等，这些现象说明老鼠已久不出入了，洞里就没有老鼠。如果洞口有新土，但是数量却很少，说明这个洞正在打，并且打的还不深，老鼠是夜里来这里工作的，白天很少在里边。有时在洞口就可看见老鼠吃剩的谷壳等，也有新鲜的老鼠脚迹，但是洞口的松土很陈旧，这证明是老鼠在里面休息、吃东西，但不在洞里居住，所以这种洞内白天是没有老鼠的。洞口很光滑，但洞口松土很陈旧，常常是蛇或青蛙占居的旧鼠洞。只有洞口光滑、洞外松土较多（一到二碗）而新鲜，没有蜘蛛丝（网），也没有才出土的小草芽等现象，洞里才一定有老鼠。
    断定洞内有鼠，怎样才知道鼠多鼠少呢？洞口新鲜土多（一碗至一升），而且用松土把洞口堵住的，里面一定有老老小小的一窝，少则四至五只，多则十几只。因为老鼠生育后，多由很隐蔽的后洞出入，或在洞内吃存粮好几天不出来，而把洞堵住，以免有蛇或其他敌人发现侵害。如果在初挖时母鼠就跑了出来，捉住它加以观察也可判定洞内鼠多鼠少。如果母鼠的奶头是膨胀的，证明洞内一定有幼鼠。且由其膨胀奶头的多少，还可判定洞内幼鼠的数目，假使所获幼鼠少于膨胀的奶头时，仍应继续挖找，以免遗漏。如果一窝中，只挖到了幼鼠，也应继续挖找，这时大老鼠常常也是在家的。
    如果洞口新鲜松土不多，洞口也没有用松土堵住，证明只有一到二只大老鼠居住，不会有幼鼠。洞口周围有被老鼠咬断的草，说明老鼠正在衔草作窝，准备生育，所以只有大老鼠而没有幼鼠。
    在挖鼠的时候，除了以上所提及的以外，并且要边挖边防备老鼠跑出来，要出来一个就消灭一个。如果已挖到了老鼠的草窝，可用手摸一摸，如果有温暖的感觉，就一定有老鼠。有时一窝老鼠都被逼到后洞或暗洞里去了，应该有决心挖到底。（原载云南日报，本报略有删改。本文由谭毓通整理）（附图片）
