Xinhua News Agency, June 1st. More than 600 literary and art workers from over 20 theaters (troupes) in the capital, along with many students from universities and middle schools, publicized the general line for socialist construction on the streets today.

Tiananmen Square, Qianmen, Dongdan, the Temple of Heaven, the square in front of the Soviet Exhibition Center, and dozens of other famous squares and hundreds of open spaces resonated with drums and gongs all day long. Literary and art propaganda troops performed and publicized amidst throngs of people. At Tiananmen Square, the China Youth Art Theater propaganda team, with Dean Wu Xue personally announcing the acts, performed the short play "Peaceful Competition." This was a new program that the actors had put together overnight. The play depicted our country's "athletes" exerting full effort to catch up with England, and the entire audience responded with continuous applause. Thousands of spectators and actors sang the song "Socialism is Good" in unison. Two workers were overheard discussing, "We Chinese are truly heroic and high-spirited now. We're sure to surpass England in less than fifteen years!"

Melodious singing rang out in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, as the propaganda team of the Air Force Political Department Cultural Troupe sang their self-composed "Plant the Red Flag of the General Line All Over the Country." The actors also performed the song and dance drama "Singing the General Line" for the audience. Near Qianmen Railway Station, hundreds and thousands of pedestrians watched as the Beijing Quyi Troupe, the New Rising Peking Opera Troupe, and other troupes took turns performing fast-clapper talks, single-string ballads, storytelling with stringed instruments, and skits. A 67-year-old woman, Grandma Shu, said after listening, "Someone at home had told me about the general line, but after watching the performance today, I understand it even better." Housewife Yang Shuzhen was very moved after watching, and she said, "Everyone is working hard, everyone is leaping forward. I'll go back and make an agreement with my husband. I guarantee to take care of the housework and do a good job in the neighborhood, so that my husband can concentrate on his work."

The literary and art groups participating in the publicity will continue to perform on the streets on the 2nd. (See picture)
