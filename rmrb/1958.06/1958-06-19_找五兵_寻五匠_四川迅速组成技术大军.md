Finding the Five Soldiers, Seeking the Five Craftsmen
Sichuan Rapidly Forms a Technical Contingent

Chengdu Dispatch from our Newspaper on June 18th: In the great development of local industry, Sichuan Province has fully tapped into the technical strength of the people, visiting the masses to seek out the wise and capable, supplemented by training, and successfully solved the difficulty of insufficient technical strength. Now, each special district, autonomous prefecture, and more than one hundred counties have successively established their own technical teams for developing local industry. Due to the rapid growth of technical strength, more than 80,000 industrial units have been built throughout the province, and there are currently more than 400,000 local industrial workers.

In the high tide of local industrial construction in Sichuan Province, the greatest difficulty felt everywhere was the lack of technical strength. Under these circumstances, in view of the fact that there were many folk industries in Sichuan Province in the past, the potential of local craftsmen was great, and there were more than 30,000 demobilized soldiers in the province with various technical skills. They adopted revolutionary methods of self-reliance, relying on the masses to extensively search for the five soldiers (retired tank soldiers, mechanical soldiers, engineering soldiers, communications soldiers, and automobile soldiers) and five craftsmen (blacksmiths, coppersmiths, silversmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons) scattered locally, as well as other technical personnel. They conducted social investigations through referrals, personal visits, neighborhood inquiries, and industry insiders connecting with each other, finding ten for every one, and a hundred for every ten. In a very short period of time, Yongchuan County discovered more than 2,800 technical personnel in the county, including construction workers, ironworkers, fitters, tank drivers and automobile soldiers familiar with mechanical properties, and old miners from the Qing Dynasty who were proficient in the direction of coal seams and mineral veins.

This group of folk technical forces is playing a significant role in various industrial construction positions. According to statistics from relevant departments, this year, there are already twenty-three small copper smelting plants built and put into production by local masters and experts throughout the province, with an annual output several times higher than the national local mine copper production last year. The only technical guidance at the Gao County Copper Plant was an old farmer who had smelted iron some years ago and two fire craftsmen who were proficient in indigenous iron and copper smelting methods. They built a blast furnace in half a month and produced 1,500 catties of copper in twelve consecutive days and nights. Wanyuan County, on the one hand, organized local experts to comprehensively explore local industrial resources, and on the other hand, tracked and explored according to the mineral source clues provided by the masses. This enabled them to grasp the distribution of resources in the county in a relatively short period of time.

When organizing and arranging folk technical forces to develop local industries, various places also paid attention to using the five soldiers and five craftsmen as the backbone to train technical forces locally and continuously expand the team. They generally adopted the method of master teaching apprentice, learning on-site, learning while doing. The nine master craftsmen of the Deyang County Man-made Fiber Factory helped the nearby handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives train 117 skilled workers to make man-made fibers in one week. They produced, taught, and learned simultaneously. Each student brought ten catties of straw and operated under the guidance of the master craftsmen. After completing their studies, they returned to experiment with production. In the process of trial production and production, they became teachers themselves and trained new technical forces.

When exploring folk craftsmen and demobilized technical soldiers to solve the difficulty of insufficient technical strength in local industry, Sichuan Province also adopted methods such as old factories helping new factories, large factories leading small factories, on-site visits and internships, and running worker technical schools to actively carry out training to meet the needs of the great development of local industry.

### 找五兵　寻五匠  四川迅速组成技术大军

    找五兵　寻五匠
    四川迅速组成技术大军
    本报成都18日电　四川省在地方工业大发展中，充分发掘民间技术力量，到群众中去访贤问能，辅以培养训练，顺利地解决了技术力量不足的困难。现在，各专区、自治州和一百多个县都相继建立起了一支自己的发展地方工业的技术队伍。由于技术力量迅速增长，全省已建成八万多个工业单位，地方工业工人目前已有四十多万人。
    四川省在兴办地方工业的建设高潮中，各地感到最大的困难是技术力量不足。在这种情况下，各地针对四川省过去民间工业较多，地方匠人的潜力很大；全省有三万多个复员军人有各种技术兵等特点，采取自力更生、群策群力的革命办法，发动群众、依靠群众广泛地搜罗散布在本地的五兵（退役的坦克兵、机械兵、工程兵、通讯兵、汽车兵）。五匠（铁匠、铜匠、银匠、木匠、石匠），以及其他技术人材。他们通过人托人、亲访亲、邻问邻、内行串内行，进行社会调查等，一找十、十找百。永川县在很短时间内，就在全县发掘出二千八百多个技术人力，其中有建筑工、铁工、钳工、熟悉机械性能的坦克手和汽车兵、精通煤层矿脉走向的清朝时代的老矿工等。
    这批民间技术力量在各种工业建设岗位上发挥着很大的作用。据有关部门统计，今年全省由土师傅、土专家建成并投入生产的小型炼铜厂，已有二十三个，年产量比去年全国地方矿山铜产量还多几倍。高县铜厂仅有的技术指导，是一个在若干年前炼过铁的老农民和两个土法炼铁、炼铜的烧火匠。他们在半个月内建成一座高炉，连续生产十二昼夜，就出铜一千五百市斤。万源县，一面组织土专家全面勘察地方工业资源，一面根据群众提供的矿源线索追踪勘查。使他们在很短时间内便大体掌握了全县资源的分布情况。
    各地在组织安排民间技术力量发展地方工业时，还注意以五兵、五匠为骨干，就地培养训练技术力量，不断扩大队伍。他们一般采取师傅带徒弟的办法，实地学习，边学边干。德阳县人造纤维厂的九个老师傅，一周内就帮助附近的手工业社和农业社培训了一百一十七个制造人造纤维的熟练工人。他们边生产边传授边学习，学员们每人自带十斤稻草，在老师傅指导下操作，学成后就回去试验生产，在试制和生产过程中，又自当师傅，再培训新的技术力量。
    四川省在发掘民间匠人和复员技术兵解决地方工业技术力量不足的困难时，还采取老厂帮新厂，大厂带小厂、现场参观实习、举办工人技术学校等办法，积极进行培养训练，来满足地方工业大发展的需要。
