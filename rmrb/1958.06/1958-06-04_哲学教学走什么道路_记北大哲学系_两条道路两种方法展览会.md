What road should philosophy teaching take?
　　——A Record of Peking University's Philosophy Department's "Two Roads, Two Methods Exhibition"
　　By our reporter Li Huaishuang

　　In the fields of culture, education and science, the struggle between two roads and two methods is also very sharp. The "Two Roads, Two Methods Exhibition" recently held by the Philosophy Department of Peking University vividly illustrates this point.

　　In recent years, under the care and leadership of the Party, the Philosophy Department of Peking University has made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism, criticizing bourgeois ideology, and training cadres for the country. However, there have also been some serious errors and shortcomings. In order to deeply develop the debate on two roads and two methods on the basis of the Red and Expert debate, and to continue the ideological revolution, the General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in the Philosophy Department of Peking University organized this exhibition based on the materials exposed in the big-character posters and symposiums in the previous stage.

　　Where will this kind of teaching lead people?

　　What kind of people we cultivate, and how we cultivate them, is the most important issue for all educators, and it is also the main issue for the Philosophy Department of Peking University. The philosophy department's policy of cultivating Marxist-Leninist philosophy researchers and Marxist-Leninist propagandists was originally very clear. However, in recent years, many students in the philosophy department do not want to be Marxist propagandists, but want to become idealist philosophy experts, and want to become "experts" who can hunt for personal fame and gain. Students revealed that the first thing students who entered the school in 1956 encountered was: "Welcome, future philosophers and psychologists!" The subsequent indoctrination was: "The Philosophy Department of Peking University has gathered the most famous philosophers in the country, and the opportunity to become established is rare." One professor openly said to the students: "After five years of study, you can be awarded the glorious title of philosopher through the national examination." In addition, the so-called "red hot" status of many idealist philosophers for a time also played a strong seductive role. In this bourgeois, idealist ideological hotbed, individualistic "expert" thinking has become rampant. Many students believe that Marxist philosophy has too strong a Party spirit, and it is too troublesome to connect with reality, and they believe that the fundamental principles are already in the classic works, and it is "difficult for them to develop creatively," so they are unwilling to read it. However, they believe that the courses "History of Chinese Philosophy" and "History of Western Philosophy" are "promising" and flock to them. It is true that, as one big-character poster said: "All kinds of expert ideals have been developed, but no one wants to be a political theory teacher or political ideological worker." Therefore, students read a large number of elective courses and few professional courses, resulting in a phenomenon of the tail wagging the dog and putting the cart before the horse. For example, a second-year philosophy student takes ten hours of physics, four hours of foreign language, and only four hours of professional courses. No wonder one student asked: "Are we students of the physics department or the philosophy department?" Obviously, if this continues, the philosophy department will not only fail to complete the state's plan to train cadres, and affect the improvement of students' political and ideological level, but also cause students to gain little or nothing in terms of mastering knowledge.

　　Various Forms of Theory Separated from Practice

　　The basic principle of our theoretical education should be "theory closely linked to practice," that is, "study theory, link with practice, improve understanding, and transform thinking." However, judging from the facts revealed in the big-character posters, due to the influence of bourgeois teaching ideas and teaching lines, the teaching work has shown a tendency to run counter to this principle. In this regard, the phenomenon of "valuing the past over the present" and "elaborating on the past and simplifying the present" is extremely prominent. For example,
  "History of Chinese Philosophy" devoted a semester to the pre-Qin period, only thirteen weeks to the modern period, and the modern part after the "May Fourth" Movement was never taught. Regarding specialized courses in the history of foreign philosophy, one big-character poster criticized that it was five-sevenths ancient philosophy and 100% idealism. Criticism of bourgeois logic theory in the imperialist era in the history of logic also accounted for only one-twenty-fourth of the entire logic theory course. The courses of dialectical materialism and historical materialism should be the most able to connect with reality, but teachers can only retell examples used by classic writers a hundred years ago when teaching; and teachers do not use Marxism-Leninism as a weapon to transform the objective world and the subjective world in the classroom, but only use it as a kind of knowledge to impart, talking about theory, not paying attention to reality, and not caring about thinking. One student criticized: "The teacher's lectures are like the deduction of concepts, language, and logic." Political teachers, like other teachers, do not care about students' political ideology. Big-character posters also revealed that many teachers despise the theoretical significance of the Party's policies and guidelines, and a strange argument is popular, saying that policies have no theoretical nature. Studying policies does not help to improve theory much. Therefore, only twenty minutes were spent conveying the spirit of the Party's "Eighth National Congress," while they were very interested in discussing whether the cat eating the mouse is an antagonistic contradiction. The separation of theory from practice is also prominently manifested in the fact that many professors take an attitude of trying their best to avoid the issue of criticizing feudal and bourgeois academic thoughts, and even believe that criticizing academic thoughts is not scientific research, but a political movement, and it is not their business. In fact, it is because they have not yet made up their minds and have the courage to criticize their past reactionary academic thoughts.

　　Idealism Runs Rampant

　　Precisely because some teachers have not yet shifted from the bourgeois standpoint, are not firm in their belief in socialism in politics, and still harbor the bourgeois set in academic and educational thoughts, and are unwilling to take Marxism as the guiding ideology. Therefore, they can not only withstand the wind and grass in politics, but even dream of the restoration of idealism in academics. This can be seen from their attitude towards the Party's "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy.

　　"Hundred Flowers Bloom" is the Party's long-term policy in culture and science, and it will continue to be resolutely implemented in the future, but "Hundred Flowers Bloom" should first be guided by Marxism. However, many professors, starting from their bourgeois standpoint and influenced by the international trend of revisionism, instinctively distorted the Party's "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, spread erroneous and even reactionary views, and had a very bad influence among people inside and outside the school. For example, one professor believes that his past notorious philosophical theory also has a reasonable core, which can be used as a school of thought standing alongside Marxism; he also said that any philosophical thought has elements that serve all classes. Some professors said that excessively emphasizing Marxism as the guiding ideology would hinder the Hundred Flowers Bloom; nor should the history of philosophy be understood according to the distinction between materialism and idealism, but should be based on the various philosophical schools and philosophers with different and varying influences in the history of philosophy as the criteria for determining the focus of the history of philosophy. Obviously, this is an attempt to negate the Party's principles of philosophy and confuse the fundamental boundary between materialism and idealism in order to achieve the purpose of idealism and materialism sharing equally or even restoring. One professor even openly declared that "we must fight for a higher evaluation of idealism." Since 1956, this view has been manifested in teaching and research work as: emphasizing idealism and neglecting materialism; emphasizing data and neglecting analysis; belittling dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and promoting revisionism. It simply formed a situation of "two peaks standing opposite each other, and two streams of water flowing." Students revealed that some teachers were beaming when they talked about idealism, but simply read from the textbook when they talked about materialism. One professor openly said in class: "Xunzi is not interesting, because he was a materialist from the beginning"; and said: "If everything is explained by dialectics, it will be impossible to explain." From this, it can be seen to what extent these professors have gone deep into the labyrinth. In this way, it is not surprising that there are students in the philosophy department who come specifically to study idealism, students who come to pursue the bourgeois demeanor, and students who regard love, art, and wine as their outlook on life, and so on. It is also no wonder that fourteen rightists were exposed in the second year of the philosophy major alone during the anti-rightist struggle.

　　This phenomenon cannot be said to be unsurprising. As for bourgeois teaching attitudes, teaching methods, academic methods, the pursuit of personal fame and gain, and other phenomena, even more have been exposed. One student said heavily: "We are increasingly moving towards capitalism."

　　The Bourgeois Banner Must Be Uprooted

　　Judging from these many facts, it is not only completely necessary, but also urgently necessary to thoroughly criticize bourgeois educational ideas, academic thoughts, and teaching methods, to thoroughly criticize idealism and revisionist thoughts, to uproot the bourgeois banner, and to raise the red banner of Marxism higher. After more than two months of ideological struggle, the Philosophy Department of Peking University has carried out great destruction and great construction, and has achieved great results. Many professors have expressed that they will systematically criticize their old philosophical thoughts, academic thoughts, and educational ideas, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, and link with reality, and have initially formulated personal Red and Expert plans. Now the double-anti movement in the Philosophy Department of Peking University is in a new stage of the great debate on teaching reform, continuing the struggle between two roads, conducting in-depth ideological criticism, and continuing the ideological revolution.

### 哲学教学走什么道路——记北大哲学系“两条道路两种方法展览会”

　　哲学教学走什么道路
　　——记北大哲学系“两条道路两种方法展览会”
　　本报记者  李怀霜
    在文教科学领域内，两条道路、两种方法之间的斗争，也是十分尖锐的。最近北京大学哲学系举办的“两条道路，两种方法展览会”，具体地鲜明地说明了这一点。
    北大哲学系几年来在党的关怀和领导下，在宣传马克思主义、批判资产阶级思想和培养国家干部的工作上，曾取得了显著的成绩。但也存在过相当严重的错误和缺点。为了在红专大辩论的基础上深入展开两条道路两种方法的辩论，继续思想革命，中共北京大学哲学系总支根据前一阶段在大字报和座谈会上揭发的材料组织了这个展览会。
    这样教学会把人们引到哪里去？
    我们培养什么样的人，怎样培养，是一切教育工作者的最主要的问题，也是北大哲学系的主要问题。哲学系要培养马列主义哲学研究工作者和马列主义宣传员的方针，原是很明确的。但近几年来许多同学在哲学系学习却不想做马克思主义宣传员，而想做唯心主义哲学专家，想做能够猎得个人名利的“专家”。同学们揭发说，1956年入校的学生第一天迎面碰到的是：“未来的哲学家，心理学家，欢迎你！”随后得到的熏陶就是：“北大哲学系集中了全国著名的哲学家，成家的机会难得”。有位教授公然向学生说：“你们学习五年后，通过国家考试，即可授与光荣的哲学家称号。”此外，由于许多唯心主义哲学家有一度所谓“红极一时”，也起了一种强烈的引诱作用。在这种资产阶级的、唯心主义的思想温床里，个人主义的“专家”思想就泛滥成灾了。许多同学认为马克思主义哲学党性太强，又要联系实际，太麻烦，并且认为根本原理经典著作中都有了，他个人“很难发挥创造性”，不愿读。而对于“中国哲学史”、“西洋哲学史”课程，却认为“大有可为”，趋之若鹜。真如有张大字报说：“什么专家的理想都有了，就是没有人愿做政治理论教师和政治思想工作人员”。因此学生们大量读选修课而少读专业课，出现了喧宾夺主、本末倒置的现象。例如，哲学专业二年级有个学生选修物理占十小时，外文占四小时，而专业课也只有四小时。难怪有位同学问道：“我们是物理学系学生，还是哲学系学生？”很显然，长此以往，哲学系不但不能完成国家培养干部的计划，影响学生政治思想水平的提高，而且在学生掌握知识方面也会造成顾此失彼，一无所长的恶果。
    理论脱离实际的形形色色
    我们的理论教育基本原则应该是“理论密切联系实际”，也即是“学习理论，联系实际，提高认识，改造思想”。但从大字报揭露的事实看，由于在资产阶级教学思想和教学路线的影响下，在教学工作中却表现了和这个原则背道而驰的倾向。在这方面，“厚古薄今”“详古略今”的现象极为突出，例如，
  “中国哲学史”讲先秦部分占了一学期，讲近代只有十三周，“五四”后的现代部分就从未讲过。关于外国哲学史专门化课程，有张大字报批评说是七分之五的古代哲学，百分之百的唯心论。逻辑史批判帝国主义时代的资产阶级逻辑理论，也只占全部逻辑理论课的二十四分之一。辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义课程本应最能联系实际的，但教师在讲授时只能转述经典作家百年前用过的例子；而且教师在课堂上不是把马列主义当做改造客观世界和主观世界的武器来教学的，而只是把它当做一门知识来传授，空谈理论，不着实际，不管思想。有个同学批评说：“先生讲课好似概念、语言、逻辑的推演”。政治课教师也和别的教师一样，不管学生政治思想。大字报还揭露说，许多教师轻视党的政策、方针的理论意义，流行着一种奇谈怪论，说什么政策没有理论性。学习政策对提高理论帮助不大。因此，传达党的“八大”精神只花了二十分钟，对讨论猫吃老鼠是不是对抗性矛盾的问题则津津有味。理论脱离实际也很突出地表现在：许多教授对于批判封建的和资产阶级的学术思想问题，采取极力回避的态度，甚至认为批判学术思想不是科学研究，而是政治运动，不是他们的事情。其实是因为他们还没有决心和勇气批判自己过去的反动学术思想。
    唯心主义大出笼
    正因为有些教师还没有从资产阶级的立场上转变过来，在政治上对社会主义信仰不坚定，在学术思想、教育思想上还怀抱着资产阶级的那一套，不愿以马克思主义为指导思想。所以，他们不但在政治上经不起风吹草动，在学术上甚至还梦寐以求唯心主义的复辟。这从他们对党的“百家争鸣”方针的态度可以看出。
    “百家争鸣”是党在文化科学方面的长远政策，今后仍要坚决贯彻，但“百家争鸣”首先应该是以马克思主义为指导思想。可是，不少教授从他们的资产阶级立场出发，又受到国际上修正主义思潮的影响，本能地歪曲了党的“百家争鸣”政策，散播了错误的甚至反动的观点，在校内外人群中起了很坏的影响。例如有位教授认为他过去的臭名远扬的哲学理论也有合理内核，可以作为和马克思主义并立的一派；还说，任何哲学思想都有为一切阶级服务的成分。有的教授则说，过分强调马克思主义作为指导思想就会妨碍百家争鸣；也不应该按照唯物主义和唯心主义的区分来认识哲学史，而应该按照在哲学史上影响不同、大小不同的各种哲学派别和哲学家作为标准来定哲学史的重点。很显然，这是企图通过否定哲学的党性原则，混淆唯物与唯心的根本界限，以达到唯心主义和唯物主义平分秋色甚至复辟的目的。有位教授甚至公开声言“要为唯心主义争得更高的评价而斗争”。这种观点，从1956年以来，在教学和研究工作中则表现为：重唯心、轻唯物；重资料、轻分析；贬低辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，宣扬修正主义。简直形成了“双峰对峙、双水分流”的局面。同学揭露，有些教师讲起唯心主义来眉飞色舞，讲到唯物主义则照本宣科。有位教授公开在课堂说：“荀子没有什么趣味，因为他一开始就是唯物主义”；又说：“什么都用辩证法讲，就没法讲了”。由此可见，这些教授们深入迷途已经到了什么程度。这样，哲学系有专为学唯心主义而来的学生，有为追求资产阶级风度而来的学生，有把爱情、艺术和美酒作为自己的人生观的学生，等等，就不足为奇了。也难怪反右斗争中仅哲学专业二年级就揭发出来十四个右派分子。
    这种现象不能说不惊人。至于资产阶级的教学态度、教学方法、治学方法，追求个人名利得失等等现象就揭露得更多了。有个同学沉重地说：“我们是越来越走向资本主义方向了”。
    必须拔掉资产阶级的旗帜
    从这许多事实看来，彻底批判资产阶级的办学思想、学术思想、教学方法，彻底批判唯心主义和修正主义思想，拔掉资产阶级旗帜，更高地树立马克思主义的红旗，不但完全必要，而且是刻不容缓的了。北大哲学系经过两个多月来的思想斗争，进行了大破大立，取得了很大的成绩。许多教授都表示要系统地批判自己旧的哲学思想、治学思想和办学思想，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，联系实际，并已初步订出个人红专规划。现在北大哲学系的双反运动已在教学改革大辩论的新阶段，继续两条道路的斗争，深入进行思想批判，继续思想革命。
