	Toothpaste Like Strained Rice Water
	The spearmint chlorophyll toothpaste produced by the Shanghai Luliuxiang Chemical Products Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, is beautifully decorated on the outside, but inside it's not a solid paste, but strained rice water. When used, the water flows out with just a slight tilt, getting the toothbrush, washbasin, and hands all messy. So every time I use it, I have to bring a towel to wipe my mouth and hands, which is very inconvenient.
	This kind of toothpaste naturally doesn't last long, and a tube is used up in half a month. To be honest, I didn't even squeeze this tube of toothpaste once, because squeezing it would make the toothpaste water shoot out like a water pistol, wasting even more. I hope this factory improves the quality of this product. Guangxi He Rongzhen

    像浆水的牙膏
    公私合营上海留兰香化学制品厂出品的留兰香叶绿素牙膏表面装饰得很美丽，但里面装的不是凝结的膏体，而是浆水，使用时，只要轻轻的一倒，浆水就会流出来，弄得牙刷、口盂、双手到处都是。所以我每次使用时，总得带上一条手巾揩嘴揩手，很是不便。
    这种牙膏自然就很不经用，半月就用完了一管。说实话我直到用完这管牙膏时，还没有用手挤过一次呢，因为用手一挤这牙膏水就会像一根射水筒似的射得老远，会用得更费，我希望这个厂改进这种产品的质量。  广西  何荣真
