　　Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 6th – Under the conquest of the high-spirited workers, the natural landscape of Sanmenxia has undergone fundamental changes. The three stone islands standing in the heart of the river have been shaved by one and a half by the people who conquered the Yellow River; the majestic "dressing table" is gone, and the magnificent "lion's head" has disappeared; remote mountainsides have become construction bases for various machinery; and ladder-shaped steep slopes have been built with factory buildings and bungalows. The heroes also split high mountains and filled deep gullies, building a sixteen-kilometer-long railway line and a thirty-kilometer-long highway from the new urban area to the dam site.

　　Since the commencement of this magnificent water conservancy project in April last year, with the direct assistance of Soviet experts and the support of the people of the whole country, and through the day and night hard work of all employees, more than 3.82 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been excavated and filled. Now, it has entered the construction climax centered on dam pouring. A huge construction team composed of various automobiles, electric shovels, cranes, bulldozers, pneumatic drills, drilling machines and other mechanical joint operations is fiercely advancing towards dam pouring and earth and stone excavation.

　　In view of the soaring enthusiasm of the employees, and in accordance with the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results put forward by the Party Central Committee, the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau Party Committee recently put forward a heroic leap forward plan to advance the damming and power generation by another year on the basis of the original plan to advance flood control and power generation by one year. To this end, they specifically arranged this year's arduous construction tasks: excavating more than 1.49 million cubic meters of earth and stone, pouring 270,000 cubic meters of concrete, and ensuring interception this year.

　　All the employees building Sanmenxia, in order to realize the plan of advance damming and power generation, have also formulated leap forward plans and guarantee conditions, and many inspiring new records have emerged one after another. The employees of Lingbao Sand and Gravel Plant, which produces concrete raw materials for dam pouring, proposed to complete the mining task of more than 3 million cubic meters of sand and gravel one year in advance. The workers who poured concrete for the dam recently jumped from a record of pouring 360 cubic meters per day to more than 1,800 cubic meters. The pneumatic drillers who excavated the dam foundation increased from more than 26 meters of vertical shallow holes per shift in the past to 118 meters.

　　今日三门峡
    新华社三门峡6日电　在干劲冲天的职工们征服下，三门峡的自然面貌已经起了根本性的变化。屹立在河心的三个石岛已被征服黄河的人们削掉一个半；巍峨的“梳妆台”不见了，壮丽的“狮子头”消失了；偏僻的山腰变成了施工的各种机械基地；梯形的陡坡建起一幢幢的厂房和平房。英雄们还劈开高山、填平深沟，修成了从新市区通往坝址的十六公里长的铁路专用线和三十公里的公路线。
    这座规模宏伟的水利枢纽工程从去年4月开工以来，在苏联专家直接帮助和全国人民的支援下，经过全体职工的日夜苦干，已经挖填土石方三百八十二万多立方。现在，这里已经进入了以浇筑大坝为中心的施工高潮。由各种汽车、电铲、吊车、推土机、风钻、钻机等机械联合作业组成的一支巨大建设队伍，正在猛烈地向大坝浇筑和土石开挖大进军。
    鉴于职工们的冲天干劲，并且根据党中央提出的多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的要求，三门峡工程局党委在原定提前一年拦洪发电的基础上，最近又提出了再提前一年拦洪、提前半年发电的英雄跃进计划。为此，他们具体地安排了今年的艰巨的施工任务：开挖土石方一百四十九万多立方，浇筑混凝土二十七万立方，确保今年截流。
    建设三门峡的全体职工，为实现提前拦洪、发电的计划，也纷纷订出了跃进规划和保证条件，并且接连不断地出现了许多振奋人心的新纪录。为浇筑大坝生产混凝土原料的灵宝砂石厂职工提出，要提前一年完成三百多万立方砂石开采任务。浇筑大坝混凝土的职工们，最近把每天浇筑三百六十立方的纪录一跃而提高到一千八百多立方。开挖坝基的风钻工，由过去每班次钻垂直浅孔二十六公尺多，提高到一百一十八公尺。
