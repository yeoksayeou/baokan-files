    Luan County Station Ticket Seller Too Unconcerned About Passengers
    On May 16th, passengers waiting at Luan County Station to buy train tickets for the 9:55 train to Beijing were buying tickets one after another. Because the ticket seller's actions were too slow, many passengers had not bought tickets by 9:30. Everyone unanimously asked the ticket seller to speed up, but the ticket seller replied that there was nothing they could do. Seeing that the train was entering the station, the station负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) did not try to speed up the ticket sales. The train left shortly after entering the station, resulting in more than twenty passengers not being able to buy tickets and board the train.
    It was rare in the past for passengers to be delayed due to slow ticket sales, but it is really inappropriate for such a thing to happen at Luan County Station during the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. I hope they pay attention and that such things do not happen again in the future.

### 滦县车站售票员太不关心旅客

    滦县车站售票员太不关心旅客
    5月16日，在滦县车站等候买火车票乘九点五十五分开往北京方面去的旅客，一个接着一个的在买票。由于售票员的售票动作太慢，到九点半钟还有很多旅客没买上票，大家一致要售票员动作快一些，但售票员回答说没有办法，眼看火车进站了，车站负责人也不设法加快卖票的速度。火车进站一会就开走了，结果有二十多个旅客没有买上票上不了车。
    因为售票慢而耽误旅客乘车，在过去都很少见，而滦县车站在大跃进的高潮中却发生这样事情，实在是太不应该了。希望他们注意，今后不再发生这样的事。
