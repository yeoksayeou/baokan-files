　　They Did Well and Did Right
    At the end of March, the Changzhou Fifth Transportation Cooperative in Jiangsu Province delivered more than ten tons of coal to our department free of charge. The story is this: Many units ordered coal from the Huainan Coal Mine, and after it was transported to Changzhou, the Fifth Transportation Cooperative was responsible for unloading the coal and transferring it to the designated locations. Because some coal crumbs always fell on the ground each time it was unloaded, the coal crumbs accumulated more and more over time. During the "Double Anti" movement, all the workers of the Transportation Cooperative divided this accumulated batch of coal crumbs into several portions according to the proportion of coal purchased by each unit, and then delivered it to each unit one by one.
    The Changzhou Fifth Transportation Cooperative's spirit of cherishing national wealth and being responsible to the owners is worthy of everyone's learning and praise.

　　他们做得好做得对
    3月末，江苏省常州市第五运输合作社给我部白白送来了十几吨煤。事情是这样的：很多单位从淮南煤矿定购的煤运到常州后，都由第五运输合作社卸车并转运到指定的地点。因为每次卸车，总有一些碎煤掉在地下。天长日久，碎煤越积越多。在“双反”运动中，运输合作社的全体职工就把这批积存下来的碎煤，按照各单位购煤数量的比例，分成若干份，然后把它一份一份地送给各单位。
    常州市第五运输合作社这种爱惜国家财富对业主负责的精神是值得大家学习和值得表扬的。
