A Good Way to Combine Theory and Practice
Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Holds Theoretical Instructor Training Class in Agricultural Cooperatives

(Reported by this newspaper) The experience of the "Three Members Five Goods" training class held by the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee proves that adopting the method of combining physical labor, grassroots work, and theoretical study, and holding training classes in agricultural production cooperatives, is an effective way to cultivate a working-class theoretical force and enable theoretical workers to become both red and expert.

After the rectification movement, the political and ideological consciousness of theoretical workers in Jiangxi Province has been greatly improved, but the phenomenon of theoretical detachment from reality and the masses is still very serious. Most of the theoretical workers have not participated in grassroots work and physical labor and are intellectuals from non-laboring people. Ideologically, they despise physical labor, and in their work and study, they read and prepare lessons behind closed doors. In light of this situation, the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee organized more than 40 theoretical instructors in April this year to hold "Three Members" (cooperative member, work team member, student) "Five Goods" (good ideology, good work, good labor, good study, good health) training classes in Yongxing and Xianzhou Agricultural Cooperatives in Yongxiu County, so that theoretical instructors could become both red and expert through the combination of theory and practice.

The specific method of the training class is: cadres and students participate in labor in the agricultural cooperative and also serve as deputy positions in the township and cooperative party and Youth League organizations and production organizations. Under the leadership of the local Party organization, they labor and work simultaneously. The activities of the training class are divided into four stages: laboring and working for more than 20 days, centralized summary and study for 15 days, then laboring and working for more than 20 days again, and then summarizing and studying for 15 days. During labor and work, investigation and research, reading newspapers and Party publications, keeping diaries, and studying and discussing are combined. During the centralized summary and study period, each person writes two papers based on their topic selection, and one ideological summary.

After 40 days of activities in the "Three Members Five Goods" training class, the trainees have gained a great deal both ideologically and theoretically. Before going down to the countryside, many people thought that physical labor was simple and only required strength. However, when they worked with the farmers, they always did it wrong. The rice seedlings transplanted by the farmers were fast and good, and they were neatly arranged without using a marker, while the seedlings transplanted by them were uneven in depth, crooked, and three people could not transplant three-tenths of a mu of land in a day. Only then did they realize that there was a lot of knowledge in physical labor. In the past, they mostly had some prejudices against farmers, thinking that farmers were selfish, conservative, and undisciplined. But after living with the farmers, they found that it was not the farmers who had these shortcomings, but themselves. The hardworking, simple, and humble noble qualities of the laboring farmers profoundly educated these comrades, greatly improving them ideologically.

Through physical labor and grassroots work, the theoretical instructors gained theoretical insights that they had never had before when studying behind closed doors. First, they established a study style centered on studying practical problems. There had been a debate before going to the countryside about whether theoretical workers currently lacked book knowledge or practical struggle knowledge. However, after going to the countryside, a part of the people who originally thought that as long as they had theory, they could apply it everywhere, but could not solve a problem that occurred in a production team. This fact educated those who read books behind closed doors. Before going to the countryside, a teacher posted a big-character poster, "Theory first or practice first?" believing that "the first thing that theoretical instructors need to solve is not practice but theory," and that "after solving the theoretical problem, going to contact practice can be ‘easy to handle’"; this big-character poster was criticized during the debate, but he did not understand. Now, he has written another article, saying, "When encountering the contradiction between rice transplanting (quota completed) and land preparation (quota not set), I don’t know how to solve it. Now I deeply understand that if theoretical instructors have no practical knowledge and do not know how to study and solve problems in practical work, then what is the use of such theoretical instructors?" In the past, everyone studied and talked about "On Practice," but they did not understand "On Practice." This time, they were inspired by their own practice. Everyone wrote: "Those who study political economy do not know about labor quotas or the planned economy of agricultural cooperatives. It can be seen that the little book knowledge we have is also incomplete." Arrogance was swept away. Before going to the countryside, some people thought that "laboring in the countryside can transform thinking, but I'm afraid I won't be able to learn theory well." Now they really understand: "Revolutionary practice, the cooperative countryside is a source of knowledge, an ocean of knowledge." Therefore, starting from the study of practical problems, everyone wrote more than 40 articles on political and ideological work and management of agricultural cooperatives. Second, they enriched their perceptual knowledge, giving the book knowledge practical content. In the past, in their study and discussions, they liked to argue about meanings and nouns, and talk about the main contradictions in general terms. This time, after going to the countryside, they had a perceptual understanding, and the discussion of issues was practical and had specific content. For example, in the past, when discussing the issue of "persuasion" versus "coercion" in the offices, they hypothesized many situations and argued for a long time, but still did not clarify the issue. This time, they used the different results of two production teams in the agricultural cooperative on the grain issue, one adopting a big debate and the other adopting a warehouse inspection, as a comparison to vividly illustrate the issue of "persuasion" versus "coercion," thereby deeply understanding Chairman Mao's article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" regarding the principle of "only persuasion" and "no coercion." Third, the writing style has changed. The lectures written in the past were tens of thousands of words long, but the issues were not explained clearly. Full of citations, without their own opinions. The more than 40 articles they wrote this time, starting from the study of practical problems, all have their own characteristics, rich materials, and clear viewpoints.

Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting of the "Three Members Five Goods" training class in Yongxiu County, believing that this form is not only a good way to cultivate working-class theoretical instructors, but also an effective way for general intellectuals to become both red and expert.

    理论实践相结合的好办法
    江西省委宣传部在农业社举办理论教员训练班
    本报讯　中共江西省委宣传部举办“三员五好”训练班的经验证明：采用体力劳动、基层工作、理论学习三者结合的办法，在农业生产合作社中举办训练班，是培养工人阶级理论队伍，使理论工作者达到又红又专的有效途径。
    经过整风运动，江西省的理论工作者政治思想觉悟大大提高，但在理论上脱离实际、脱离群众的现象仍十分严重。理论工作者中大部分都是没有参加过基层工作和体力劳动，出身于非劳动人民的知识分子，在思想上轻视体力劳动，工作和学习上是关门读书，关门备课。江西省委宣传部根据这种情况，今年4月组织了四十多个理论教员在永修县永兴、仙洲两个农业社内举办“三员”（社员、工作队员、学员）“五好”（思想好、工作好、劳动好、学习好、身体好）训练班，使理论教员通过理论与实践相结合的途径达到又红又专。
    训练班的具体作法是：干部和学员都在农业社内参加劳动，同时都分别担任乡、社党团组织和生产组织的副职，在当地党组织领导下一面劳动，一面工作。训练班的活动分为四个阶段：劳动、工作二十多天，集中总结学习十五天，再劳动、工作二十多天，再总结学习十五天。在劳动和工作中结合进行调查研究、读报、读党刊、记日记和学习讨论。集中总结学习期间，根据各人的选题写出两篇论文，一篇思想总结。
    “三员五好”训练班经过四十天的活动后，受训的学员不论在思想上和理论上都有了很大的收获。下去以前，许多人认为体力劳动简单，只要有力气就行。但是当他们自己和农民一块劳动时，总是做得不对头。农民插的秧又快又好，不用划行器也整整齐齐，而他们插的秧是深浅不一，弯弯曲曲，三个人一天还插不了三分田。这样，他们才认识到体力劳动中也大有学问。过去，他们大都对农民的认识有着某些偏见，认为农民自私、保守、散漫。但在和农民共同生活后，他们发现具有这些缺点的不是农民，而正是自己。劳动农民的勤劳、朴素、谦虚的高贵品质深刻地教育了这些同志，使他们在思想上有了很大的提高。
    理论教员通过体力劳动、基层工作的亲身实践，在理论上也有了过去关门读书时从未有过的收获。第一，树立了以研究实际问题为中心的学风。关于目前理论工作者最缺乏的是书本知识还是实际斗争的知识这个问题，在下乡前曾有过争论。但在下乡后，一部分原来认为只要有理论就能到处联系实际的人，结果不能解决一个生产队里发生的问题，这个事实教育了那些关门读书的人。下乡前，有个教员贴了一张“先理论还是先实际？”的大字报，认为“理论教员首先需要解决的不是实际而是理论”，认为“先解决了理论问题，再去接触实际，就可‘驾轻就熟’”；这张大字报在辩论时受了批判，但他没想通。现在，他又写了一篇文章，说“遇到插秧（已完额）和整田（未定额）的矛盾就不知道应如何解决。现在我深深的了解到，理论教员如果没有实际知识，不懂得研究解决实际工作中的问题，那末，这样的理论教员还有什么用？”过去，大家学过讲过“实践论”，但是没有懂得“实践论”，这一次从亲身实践中得到了启发。大家写道：“学政治经济学的，不知道劳动定额，不知道农业社的计划经济。可见，我们懂得的一点书本知识也是残缺不全的”。骄气为之一扫。下乡前，有人认为“在乡下劳动可以改造思想，恐怕学不好理论”，现在真正懂得了：“革命实践，合作化的农村是知识的源泉，是知识的海洋。”因此，大家从研究实际问题出发，写出了有关农业社政治思想工作和经营管理的四十多篇文章。第二，丰富了感性知识，使书本知识有了实际内容。过去，他们在学习讨论中嗜好争论含义、名词，泛泛的谈主要矛盾。这次下乡后有了感性认识，讨论问题切合实际，有了具体内容。例如过去在机关里讨论“说服”与“压服”的问题，假设了很多情况，争论了很久，还是没有弄清。这次他们用农业社两个生产队在粮食问题上，一个采取大辩论，一个采取查仓的两种不同办法，得到两种效果的事例做对比，就生动地说明了“说服”与“压服”的问题，从而深刻地理解了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文对“只能说服”与“不能压服”的道理。第三，改变了文风。过去写的讲稿长达数万字，但问题还阐述不清。满篇引证，没有自己的见解。这次他们从研究实际问题出发写出的四十多篇文章，都各具特点，材料丰富，观点明确。
    最近，中共江西省委宣传部在永修县召开了“三员五好”训练班现场会议，认为这种形式不仅是培养工人阶级理论教员的良好办法，也是一般知识分子达到又红又专的一个有效途径。
