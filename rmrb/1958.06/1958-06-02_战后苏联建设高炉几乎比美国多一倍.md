Xinhua News Agency, June 1st, Stalin Note: The Soviet Union built almost twice as many blast furnaces in the post-war period as the United States did in the same period. This was announced by Bandos, Director of the Southern Industrial Construction Scientific Research Center of the Soviet Union, at the All-Ukrainian Scientific and Technological Conference on Rapid Construction of Blast Furnaces on May 31.

Before the war, it took fifteen to twenty months for the Soviet Union to build a blast furnace. Now the speed has doubled. The Soviet Union has built a number of large enterprises that manufacture steel structures. These steel structures are assembled into components at construction sites, and then the components are assembled into blast furnaces.

The scientific and technological conference discussed the prospects for further shortening the construction time of metallurgical equipment.

In the next seven years, Ukraine will build dozens of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, coke ovens, etc. Five of the seven blast furnaces that the Soviet Union plans to build this year will be built in Ukraine.

　　战后苏联建设高炉几乎比美国多一倍
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社斯大林诺讯：战后时期苏联建设的高炉比美国在同一时期内建设的几乎多一倍。这是苏联南部工业建设科学研究中心主任班多斯5月31日在全乌克兰快速建设高炉科学技术会议上宣布的。
    战前苏联建设一座高炉需要十五个月到二十个月，现在速度加快了一倍。苏联建成了一些制造钢结构的大型企业。这些钢结构在建筑工地装配成部件，然后用部件装配成高炉。
    这次科学技术会议讨论了进一步缩短冶金设备建设时间的前景。
    在今后七年中乌克兰将兴建数十座高炉和平炉、压延机、炼焦炉等。苏联计划在今年兴建的七座高炉中有五座将在乌克兰建造。
