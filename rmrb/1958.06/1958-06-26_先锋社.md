    Pioneer Cooperative
    The fourth production team of the Pioneer Cooperative in Tangfang Township, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, an experimental group composed of five young people, Zhao Faming, He Dengbang, He Dengkui, He Yuejin, and He Nengneng, conducted a high-yield wheat experiment on 1.6 mu of black saline-alkali soil last year, using all transplanted seedlings. After recent threshing and weighing, a total of 2,695 jin was harvested, with an average yield of 1,684 jin and 15 liang per mu, which is more than 1,300 jin higher than the cooperative's average wheat yield of 321 jin, significantly breaking the county's previous highest wheat yield record of 906 jin.
