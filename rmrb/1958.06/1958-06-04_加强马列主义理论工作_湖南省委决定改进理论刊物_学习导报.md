　　加强马列主义理论工作
    湖南省委决定改进理论刊物“学习导报”
    本报讯  为了加强马克思列宁主义的理论工作，推动全面跃进、多快好省地建设社会主义，中共湖南省委于5月19日作出了关于改进理论刊物“学习导报”的决定。
      “学习导报”是湖南省的理论刊物，从1952年创办，1956年10月改为定期刊物，并在1957年元月公开发行。几年来，这个刊物在辅导干部政治理论学习、宣传马列主义和党的方针政策方面发挥了积极的作用。特别是通过反右派斗争，整顿了队伍，批判了资产阶级右派言论，加强了理论工作的战斗性。
    决定中指出：今后“学习导报”的编辑方针应当是：在毛泽东思想指导下，密切结合本省和全国社会主义革命、社会主义建设的实践，推动和帮助干部、知识分子学习马列主义、学习党中央的决议、指示、文件，学习毛泽东同志的著作，探讨社会主义革命和社会主义建设中提出来的实际问题，以及干部和学术界提出的理论问题，提高全省干部、知识分子政治理论和思想水平，并通过这个理论刊物积极促进全省理论队伍的培养和提高。
    决定指出：根据以上编辑方针，“学习导报”的任务可包括以下几个方面：一、辅导干部和知识分子的政治理论学习；二、对社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的实际问题进行理论研究和宣传，从理论上阐述党的方针政策；三、对马列主义的基本原理进行通俗宣传；四、研究干部和学术界提出的重要理论问题，批判资产阶级的学术思想；五、时事政策方面重大问题的宣传。
    为了办好这个理论刊物，省委要求全党，特别是各级党委负责同志和各方面的负责同志予以重视和支持，并采取以下措施：一、在各部委、厅局与省级各企业部门成立评论小组，对工作中的重大问题进行理论上的研究，并写出文章；各地（市）、县委对工作中有关的重大问题，要进行理论研究，并写出文章，要求每季组织和推荐至少一篇有一定分量的文章。各级党委负责同志和各方面的负责同志应加强理论学习，有计划地研究工作中的重大问题，把实践中的经验提高到理论上来，这将有利于全省工作水平的提高，同时也将有利于马列主义理论工作的发展；理论工作者应当充分注意利用这个理论刊物来进行工作，并锻炼自己，力求理论联系实际，提高自己的水平。二、扩大编委会，由省委宣传部唐麟同志主持编委会的工作。（邝麓安）
