Jilin Province's sika deer breeding farms have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of young deer and antlers. As of early June, the province's ten deer farms had produced 1,155 young deer. This year, the young deer in all farms are very strong, and the survival rate has generally increased. The average survival rate of young deer in the ten deer farms is 91%. The antlers in all farms are also growing very large and plump. One two-tined antler cut at the Longtan Mountain Deer Farm weighed 53 taels, setting a new national record. The ten deer farms have harvested a total of 44 pairs of antlers, with an average weight of 30 taels, an increase of 7 taels compared to last year.

Deer are very timid animals, especially when they are about to give birth. Even a small sound can frighten the does and cause dystocia. Therefore, caring for does during childbirth is an extremely delicate task. After education through the rectification movement, and encouraged by the General Line, the staff of the deer farms have made great improvements in their maternal care work this year. During the does' labor, leading cadres of each farm personally participated in assisting the delivery and solved problems on the spot as soon as they were discovered, greatly reducing accidents.

At present, while the staff of the deer farms are busily caring for the young deer and harvesting antlers, they are also summarizing the experiences and lessons learned from the previous stage of work through research and debate, striving to achieve a higher survival rate for the more than 800 young deer that are about to be born.

    吉林仔鹿和鹿茸空前丰收
    吉林省各国营养鹿场的仔鹿和鹿茸空前丰收。截至6月初，全省十个养鹿场已产仔鹿一千一百五十五头。今年各场仔鹿都很壮实，成活率普遍提高，十个鹿场仔鹿平均成活率是91％。各场鹿茸生长也很肥大。龙潭山鹿场的一个二杠锯茸水重五十三市两，创全国最高纪录。十个鹿场共已收锯鹿茸四十四副，平均水重三十两，比去年提高七两。
    鹿是十分胆小的动物，特别是临产时，一点小的声音就能使母鹿受惊引起难产。因此护理母鹿产仔是一件极为细致的工作。鹿场职工们经过整风运动教育，在总路线的鼓舞下，今年的护产工作有很大改进。在母鹿临产中，各场领导干部亲自参加助产，发现问题立即就地解决，使事故大大减少。
    目前，各鹿场职工一面紧张护产仔鹿和收割鹿茸，一面通过研究辩论，总结前一段工作的经验教训，争取即将产下的八百多头仔鹿达到更高的成活率。
