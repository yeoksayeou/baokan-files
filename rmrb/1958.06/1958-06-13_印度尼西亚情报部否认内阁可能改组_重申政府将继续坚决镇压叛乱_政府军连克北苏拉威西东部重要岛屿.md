Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 11th. The Indonesian Information Ministry broadcast on the radio on the evening of June 11th that Indonesia will continue to resolutely suppress the rebel groups, and the Indonesian authorities have no intention of changing the established policy toward the rebel groups.

The Information Ministry's broadcast said that recently there have been rumors circulating in Indonesia about the cabinet possibly changing its attitude towards domestic problems. The broadcast said that such rumors are harmful.

The Information Ministry quoted President Sukarno's recent statement to a reporter from the Hungarian "People's Liberty Newspaper" that Indonesia's main task at present is to suppress the rebel groups. After crushing the rebellion, Indonesia will concentrate all its efforts to build a rational and prosperous society. The Information Ministry said that this remains Indonesia's guide to action. Although the task is arduous, Indonesia is capable of thwarting conspiracies that attempt to change the above goals.

The Information Ministry also quoted Prime Minister Djuanda as saying that the cabinet has not discussed the issue of reorganization.

The Information Ministry expressed hope that the good situation that has emerged in the country after defeating the rebel group in West Sumatra will not be disturbed by various rumors speculating about a cabinet reshuffle. It said that the government and the army are adhering to the principle of resolutely打击 (dǎ jī - strike, crack down on) the rebel groups.

People in Jakarta are paying close attention to this broadcast. It is believed that the broadcast has打击 (dǎ jī - strike, crack down on) various conspiracies attempting to promote a compromise between the Indonesian government and the rebel groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 12th. The Indonesian Army Information Service announced on the evening of June 11th that the joint forces of the government army had captured some important islands around the Minahasa area in the far east of North Sulawesi in early June. The recovered islands include Talese Island, dozens of kilometers northeast of Manado, and Lembeh Island outside Bitung Port.

The government forces annihilated the rebels on these islands and captured a rebel artillery squadron and a captain.

    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚情报部11日晚上在电台广播说，印度尼西亚将继续坚决地镇压叛乱集团，印度尼西亚当局无意修改对叛乱集团的既定政策。
    情报部的广播说，最近印度尼西亚国内散布着内阁可能改变它对国内问题的态度的消息。广播说，这种消息是有害的。
    情报部引述苏加诺总统最近对匈牙利“人民自由报”记者的谈话说，印度尼西亚目前的主要任务是镇压叛乱集团，在粉碎叛乱以后，印度尼西亚将集中一切力量来建立一个合理的和繁荣的社会。情报部说，这仍然是印度尼西亚的行动指南。虽然任务繁重，但是，印度尼西亚有能力挫败那些试图改变上述目标的阴谋。
    情报部还引述朱安达总理的话说，内阁并没有讨论过改组的问题。
    情报部表示希望，在击败西苏门答腊叛乱集团以后在国内出现的良好局面不至于被各种推测内阁改组的传说所扰乱。它说，政府和军队遵守着坚决打击叛乱集团的原则。
    雅加达人士很注意这个广播，人们认为这个广播打击了各种企图促使印度尼西亚政府同叛乱集团妥协的阴谋。
    据新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处11日晚上宣布，政府军联合部队已经在6月初攻占了北苏拉威西极东部米那哈沙地区周围的一些重要岛屿。收复的岛屿包括万鸦老东北数十公里的达里赛岛和比东港外面的伦勿岛在内。
    政府军歼灭了这些岛屿上的叛军，并且俘虏了叛军的一个炮兵中队和一名上尉。陆军新闻处说，叛军在6月5日从比东向伦勿岛反攻，但被政府军击退。在战斗中有十五名叛军被击毙。
    目前，北苏拉威西东端米那哈沙地区周围的重要岛屿都落入政府军手中，并且变成了政府军在这个叛军心脏地区登陆的重要跳板。
