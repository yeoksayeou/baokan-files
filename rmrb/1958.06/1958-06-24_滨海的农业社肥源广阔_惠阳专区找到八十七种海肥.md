Coastal Agricultural Cooperatives Have Broad Fertilizer Sources
Huiyang Prefecture Finds Eighty-Seven Kinds of Sea Fertilizer
(Our Dispatch) The six coastal counties of Huiyang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, are turning the vast ocean into a fertilizer warehouse serving agricultural production, opening up a broad path for agricultural fertilizer use. Bao'an, Dongguan, Huiyang, Huidong, Haifeng, and Lufeng counties in the district have put forward the slogan "Seek fertilizer from the sea and nourish the fields with the sea." Currently, 494 units of all sizes are producing various kinds of sea fertilizer with good fertilizer content in large quantities. Many fishermen, salt workers, farmers, and urban residents are making sea fertilizer by hand in every household. Various localities will also focus on establishing medium and small-sized mechanized and semi-mechanized fertilizer factories to manufacture sea fertilizer in large quantities.

Huiyang Prefecture faces the sea with its back to the mountains, and the ocean has abundant fertilizer sources. According to preliminary investigations, eighty-seven kinds of sea fertilizer, including marine animals, plants, minerals, and seawater and sea mud, have been collected and successfully trial-produced. Among them, sixty kinds have been scientifically tested and practically experimented with, and the fertilizer effect is very good.

    滨海的农业社肥源广阔
    惠阳专区找到八十七种海肥
    本报讯  广东省惠阳专区沿海六个县正在把辽阔的海洋变为一个为农业生产服务的肥料仓库，给农业用肥开拓一条广阔的道路。该区宝安、东莞、惠阳、惠东、海丰和陆丰等县，提出了“向海要肥、以海养田”的口号，目前，有四百九十四个大小单位在大量生产各种肥分很好的海肥，许多渔民、盐民、农民及城镇居民都家家户户动手制海肥，各地还将重点建立中、小型的机械化和半机械化的制肥工厂，大量制造海肥。
    惠阳专区背山面海，海洋的肥源十分丰富。根据初步调查，现在已经开始采集和试制成功的海洋动物、植物、矿物及海水海坭等海肥有八十七种，其中有六十种经过科学化验与实际试验，肥效很好。
