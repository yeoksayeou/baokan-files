Lessons from Lessons
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    A year ago, this newspaper published the reports and commentaries of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on the incident of deaths from starvation due to disaster in PingLe, Lipu, and other counties in the Pingle Special District of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as the editorial "Resolutely Fight Bureaucracy That Disregards Human Life" regarding this incident. In that editorial, we stated that this was a serious incident, but on a national scale, it was only an isolated phenomenon; the Party and the government would handle such individual incidents with seriousness and responsibility, and educate cadres to earnestly learn lessons from them and practically improve their style of work. The changes over the past year have fully proved that this judgment was correct. Through the rectification movement, the cadres of the Pingle Special District have overcome bureaucratic styles, leading the people of the entire district to restore and develop production. Those who fled their homes due to disaster have returned to their hometowns, barren fields are filled with lush crops, people live a stable life, and a harmonious scene has emerged everywhere.

    Communists are not immortals, and there will always be shortcomings and mistakes, large or small, in their work; however, compared with the tremendous achievements made by the Communist Party in leading the people in revolution and national construction, the shortcomings and mistakes in the work are extremely minor, only one finger out of ten, or even less than one finger. Take the deaths from starvation due to disaster in Guangxi in 1956 as an example. As staff members of the Party and the government, failing to do their work well and the occurrence of deaths from starvation were indeed serious mistakes. But it should also be seen that on a national scale, under the leadership of the Party and the government, not tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands, but millions and tens of millions of people were saved in several disasters; and even in that disaster in Guangxi, the vast majority of people were properly resettled, and only a very small number died from starvation. This shows that, whether in Guangxi or nationwide, the achievements of disaster relief work are the main aspect, accounting for nine fingers; the shortcomings and mistakes are secondary, accounting for one little finger. The problem with this little finger is only a problem of ideological style, and thus can be resolved through persuasion and education. The Party Central Committee and the State Council's handling of the relevant cadres responsible for the deaths from starvation in the Pingle Special District at that time was also to achieve the purpose of education.

    However, despite the clear distinction between right and wrong at the time, the right-wing elements with ulterior motives seized on this matter to maliciously attack our Party and attack agricultural collectivization, saying that Party member cadres were worse than the Kuomintang, and that agricultural collectivization was a complete mess. It is not surprising that the right-wing elements, as enemies of the people, would say such things. What is noteworthy is that when the right-wing elements seized on the incident of deaths from starvation in Guangxi to make a big fuss, many cadres also shouted along with them. One of the important reasons why these cadres shouted like this was that they did not understand the relationship between one finger and nine fingers. There was great one-sidedness in their way of thinking. They only saw one aspect of things and did not see the other aspects; they only saw the non-essential and non-mainstream things of things, and could not grasp the essential and mainstream things, and always replaced the essential and mainstream things with the non-essential and non-mainstream things. In dealing with the incident of deaths from starvation in Guangxi, they precisely committed this one-sided mistake. They did not compare it with the achievements of disaster relief work in Guangxi and the whole country, let alone with the achievements in the entire national work, and rashly echoed the reactionary clamor of the right-wing elements. This shows that if a person does not have a correct way of thinking and cannot observe problems comprehensively, they cannot have the keen ability to identify the direction of the wind, and they are bound to make mistakes, and even political mistakes.

    Saying that the shortcomings and mistakes in the work are secondary, of course, does not mean that shortcomings and mistakes can be tolerated; on the contrary, pointing out this point is precisely to give us more confidence to correct shortcomings and mistakes. But how to correct these shortcomings and mistakes? Should we simply make a clean break and cut off this diseased finger, or should we cure it? The right-wing elements advocate taking the former approach. They not only want to cut off the diseased finger, but also want to expand it as much as possible, cutting off all fingers and describing the work of the Party and the government as completely dark. We are certainly opposed to doing this, because we clearly know that although the mistakes of the personnel involved in this unfortunate incident are serious, they are only mistakes in ideological style and work methods, and are contradictions among the people. Giving appropriate disciplinary sanctions to the personnel who made mistakes is very necessary; without doing so, we cannot strictly enforce the discipline of the Party and the country; but this is also mainly to educate them to correct their mistakes, and cannot "kill them with one blow." The changes in the rectification movement over the past year have proved that such treatment is completely correct. On the one hand, it unites and educates the comrades who made mistakes, giving them the opportunity to continue serving the Party and the people; on the other hand, it educates other cadres to learn lessons and improve their ideological style. In the past, many cadres in the Pingle Special District did not care about the suffering of the masses, but now they are all concerned about the production and life of the masses. In the past, their work style was boastful and floating, but now they can go deep into reality and the masses, leading the masses to rapidly restore and develop production. This clear change in the situation once again shows that we must learn to treat contradictions of different natures with different methods in order to seek the correct solution of contradictions and promote our cause to move forward rapidly.

    教训中的教训
    本报评论员
    一年以前，本报发表了中共中央和国务院处理广西僮族自治区平乐专区平乐、荔浦等县因灾饿死人事件的报道和评论这个事件的“坚决同漠视民命的官僚主义作斗争”的社论。在这篇社论中，我们曾说明，这是一个严重的事件，然而就全国范围来说，这只是个别的现象；对于这种个别的事件，党和政府是要作严肃负责处理的，并教育干部认真地从中吸取教训，切实地改进自己的作风。一年来的变化完全证明了这个论断是正确的。经过整风运动，平乐专区的干部已经克服了官僚主义作风，领导全区人民恢复和发展了生产，因灾逃荒的人们返回了家园，荒芜的田地长满了绿油油的庄稼，人民过着安定的生活，到处出现了乐融融的景象。
    共产党人不是神仙，在他们的工作中总是会出现或大或小的缺点和错误的；但是，同共产党领导人民革命和国家建设取得的巨大成绩比较起来，工作中的缺点和错误是极为次要的，只不过是十个指头中的一个指头，甚至还不到一个指头。就拿广西1956年因灾饿死人来说，作为党和政府的工作人员，没有能够把工作作好，发生了饿死人的现象，这确是严重的错误。但同时也应该看到，在全国范围内，在党和政府的领导下，在几次灾荒中被救活的不是几万、几十万而是几百万、几千万人；而且就是在广西那次的灾荒中，得到妥善安置的也是绝大多数人，因灾饿死的只是极少数。这就说明，不论在全国或广西，救灾工作的成绩都是主要的，是九个指头；缺点和错误是次要的，是一个小指头。这个小指头的毛病，也只是思想作风上的毛病，因而可以用说服教育的方法来解决。党中央和国务院当时对于平乐专区因灾饿死人事件应负责任的有关干部的处理，也是为了达到教育的目的。
    但是，尽管是非界限在当时就是那样地分明，可是别有用心的右派分子却抓住这件事情，恶意地攻击我们的党，攻击农业合作化，把党员干部说得比国民党还不如，把农业合作化说得一团糟。右派分子是人民的敌人，这样说没有什么可奇怪的。值得注意的，倒是在右派抓住广西因灾饿死人事件大做文章的时候，也有不少干部跟在后面叫喊。这些干部所以这样叫喊，重要的原因之一，是不懂得一个指头和九个指头的关系。他们的思想方法上有很大的片面性，只看到事物的一个方面，看不到事物的其他诸方面；只看到事物的非本质和非主流的东西，捉不住事物的本质的和主流的东西，而且总是用非本质和非主流的东西代替本质的和主流的东西。在对待广西因灾饿死人这件事情上，他们就恰恰犯了这种片面性的毛病，没有把它同广西和全国救灾工作的成绩比一比，更没有把它同整个国家工作中的成绩比一比，就轻率地附和了右派分子的反动叫嚣。这就说明，一个人如果没有正确的思想方法，不会全面地观察问题，就不可能有敏锐的识别风向的能力，就必然要犯错误，而且犯政治性的错误。
    说工作中的缺点和错误是次要的，这当然不是说可以容忍缺点和错误；相反地，指出这一点，正是为了使我们更有信心纠正缺点和错误。但是，怎样纠正这些缺点和错误呢？是干脆一刀两断，把这个有病的指头砍去，还是把它医好呢？右派分子是主张采取前一种办法，他们不仅要砍掉那个有病的指头，还要尽量扩大化，要把所有指头都砍掉，把党和政府的工作说成漆黑一团。我们当然反对这样做，因为我们清楚地知道，在这个不幸事件中有关人员的错误固然是严重的，但也只是思想作风和工作方法上的错误，是人民内部矛盾。给予犯错误的人员适当的纪律处分，这是十分必要的，不如此，就不能严肃党和国家的纪律；但这也主要是为了教育他们改正错误，而不能对他们“一棍子打死”。一年来整风运动中的变化，已经证明这样处理是完全正确的，一方面既团结教育了犯错误的同志，使他们有继续为党为人民服务的机会；另一方面又教育其他干部吸取教训，改进自己的思想作风。过去，平乐专区的许多干部，不关心群众的疾苦，现在都很关心群众的生产和生活。过去，他们的工作作风虚夸飘浮，现在都能深入实际和群众，领导群众迅速地恢复和发展了生产。事情的这种鲜明的变化，再一次说明了，必须学会用不同的方法对待不同性质的矛盾，才有可能求得矛盾的正确解决，推动我们的事业迅速地向前发展。
