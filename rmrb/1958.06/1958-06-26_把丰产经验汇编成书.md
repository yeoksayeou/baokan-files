    Compile Bumper Harvest Experiences into a Book
    The nationwide wheat harvest is a widespread success, with countless high-yield records emerging. This is a concrete demonstration of the General Line of Socialist Construction transforming into a tremendous material force, and a great victory for socialist construction. In order to plant the flag of high-yield records across every inch of land in the country, I suggest that all units achieving bumper harvests (from teams, communes, counties, and even provinces) summarize their valuable experiences and specific practices that enabled them to achieve such yields. The state should then compile these summaries into a book and disseminate them in various ways, so that the seeds of the 1958 bumper wheat harvest can bear fruit on every inch of land in the country in 1959.

    把丰产经验汇编成书
    全国小麦普告丰收，出现了无数的高额丰产纪录，这是社会主义建设总路线变成了巨大的物质力量的具体证明，是社会主义建设的伟大胜利。为了把高额丰产纪录的红旗插遍全国每一寸土地，我建议凡是丰产的单位（从队、社、县甚至是省）都把他们所以能获得丰产的宝贵经验与具体做法加以总结，由国家汇编成书，用各种方式加以传播推广，让1958年小麦丰产的种子，1959年在全国每寸土地上结果。
