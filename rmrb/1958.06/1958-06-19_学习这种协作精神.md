　　Learning This Spirit of Collaboration
　　Before the expansion project of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant started, we encountered a difficulty in administrative work: it was difficult to solve the problem of the large number of office supplies and furniture needed by the expansion team. When the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and its affiliated Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, and Mineral Processing Design Institute learned of our difficulties, they immediately transferred various idle appliances to us for use free of charge. According to statistics, the value of the materials allocated by the units was more than 280,000 yuan. The first batch alone consisted of more than 4,000 pieces, and a large number of materials were being prepared for continued shipment. Thanks to the strong support of the above-mentioned units, the enthusiasm of the expansion workers was greatly encouraged, and the preparatory work progressed rapidly, with one new record after another.
　　In addition to thanking the above-mentioned units for their enthusiastic help, we also suggest that other units learn from their spirit of collaboration and transfer idle materials to support new or expanded enterprises.
　　Sun Shuangxin, Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of the General Affairs Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    学习这种协作精神
    在石景山钢铁厂扩建工程开工之前，我们在行政工作上遇到一个困难，这就是扩建队伍所需要的大批办公用具和家具不好解决。当冶金工业部及其所属有色冶金设计院、黑色冶金设计院和选矿设计院等单位了解到我们的困难后，立即分别把闲置不用的各种器具无偿的调拨给我们使用。据统计，各单位拨给的物资价值二十八万多元，仅第一批运来的就有四千多件，还有大批物资准备继续运来。由于上述单位的大力支援，大大地鼓舞了扩建职工的劳动热情，准备工程进展迅速，新纪录一个接着一个。
    我们除了感谢上述单位的热情帮助，并建议其他单位学习他们这种协作的精神，把闲置不用的物资调出来支援新建或扩建企业使用。
