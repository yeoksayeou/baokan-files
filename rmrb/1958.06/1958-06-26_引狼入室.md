　　Letting the Wolf in the Door
　　Recently, the United States has been eager to try and plot armed intervention in Lebanon. When asked whether the United States would apply the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to intervene, Lebanese President Camille Chamoun said, "It probably won't apply the Eisenhower Doctrine as generally understood, but there is a provision that the United States may intervene when its vital interests are endangered."
　　What does Chamoun mean by this statement? It means that the United States' intervention in Lebanon is "justified" because "its vital interests are endangered." However, everyone knows that the matter in Lebanon is entirely a matter for the Lebanese people themselves and has nothing to do with the so-called vital interests of the United States. There is no question of any "endangerment." What is truly endangered is the independence, sovereignty, and freedom of the Lebanese people, which the United States wants to stifle with the colonialist shackles of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
　　If someone who did not know Chamoun's identity heard his remarks, they might think he was some official from Washington. Chamoun is so preoccupied with the so-called vital interests of the United States, while the sovereignty and vital interests of the Lebanese people have no place in his eyes. It is clear that Chamoun is willing to let the wolf in the door, playing the role of betraying national interests, is it not?

    引狼入室
    最近美国正在跃跃欲试，策划对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。黎巴嫩总统夏蒙在回答美国是否会应用“艾森豪威尔主义”进行干涉的问题时说：“大概不会如一般所理解的那样应用艾森豪威尔主义，但是其中有一条规定，与它的切身利益遭到危险的时候，美国可能进行干涉。”
    夏蒙这番话是什么意思呢？那就是说，美国要向黎巴嫩进行干涉是“师出有名”的，因为“它的切身利益遭到了危险”。但是，任何人都清楚，黎巴嫩的事情完全是黎巴嫩人民自己的事情，跟所谓美国的切身利益风马牛不相及，根本谈不到什么“遭到危险”。而真正遭到危险的倒是美国想用“艾森豪威尔主义”这条殖民主义枷锁予以扼杀的黎巴嫩人民的独立主权和自由。
    如果不明了夏蒙身份的人听了上面他的这番话，会以为他是华盛顿的一个什么官员哩。夏蒙如此念念不忘美国的所谓切身利益，而黎巴嫩人民的主权和切身利益在他的眼里却是没有位置的。可见，夏蒙甘愿引狼入室，充当出卖民族利益的角色，不是很清楚了吗？！
