The Original Spirit of Running a University
　　Zu Nian

　　When it comes to running a university, people easily think of tall buildings, complete equipment, and famous professors. However, the university run by Mengjin County, Henan Province, published in today's newspaper, has neither fixed school buildings nor full-time professors. There are two different views on this phenomenon: one view is that it doesn't look like a university; without fixed school buildings and professors, what kind of talent can be cultivated! These people look down on this so-called "irregular" approach. The other view is: this approach is a product of the Great Leap Forward in our country, and the masses are jubilantly in favor of such schools.

　　Is this approach to running a university in Mengjin County good or not? It is very good. They run the university entirely from a practical standpoint, following the mass line. Their slogan is: wherever there are experts, creations, inventions, and experience, the department should be set up there. This approach has many advantages: first, the school is set up without the state spending money to build school buildings; second, the most experienced teachers are invited without having to look for teachers everywhere; third, the site is the laboratory, and the knowledge learned is also practical knowledge, which can immediately solve practical problems. In short, this method of running a school relying on the masses can quickly and effectively cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Isn't such a university beneficial in every way without a single harm? There are not too many such universities, but too few.

　　The fact that Mengjin County runs a university is a blow to the head for those who are superstitious and believe that only "regular" institutions of higher learning can be run. Anyone who still believes that this kind of university cannot be counted as a university, that running a university must have "experts," that there must be tall buildings and complete equipment, and that this kind of university cannot cultivate the talents needed by the country, is a fool talking in his sleep. If we run schools according to this kind of thinking, how can a university be run in a county, and how can more than 130 colleges and universities be newly established in seventeen provinces and cities in two months? This kind of thinking cannot bring about great development in education, nor can it cultivate talents who are both red and expert quickly, well, and economically.

　　The comrades in Mengjin County broke through this superstitious thinking, relied on the masses, and dared to run a university of a very grand scale. This is a revolutionary spirit worthy of advocacy and learning.

    办大学的独创精神
    祖年
    提起办大学，人们很容易想到高楼大厦、完善的设备、出名的教授。可是，今天本报发表的河南省孟津县办的大学，既没有固定的校舍，也没有专职的教授。对于这样一种现象，有两种不同的看法：一种看法认为这不像大学，没有固定的校舍和教授，能培养出什么人材来呢！这些人对这种所谓不“正规”看不上眼。另一种看法是：这种做法正是我国大跃进形势的产物，群众欢欣鼓舞地赞成这样的学校。
    孟津县办大学的这种办法好不好呢？很好。他们办大学完全从实际出发，走群众路线。他们的口号是：哪里有专家、有创造、有发明、有经验，就把科设在哪里。这种做法好处很多：第一，不要国家花钱盖校舍，就把学校办起来了；第二，不要到处找教师，就请到了最有经验的教师；第三，现场就是实验室，学到的知识也是实际的知识，可以马上解决实际问题。总之，这种依靠群众的办学方法，可以迅速有效地培养出有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。这种大学不是有百利而无一害吗？这样的大学不是太多了，而是太少了。
    孟津县办大学的事实，对那些迷信只能办“正规”的高等学校的人，真是当头一棒。谁要再认为这种大学不能算大学，办大学就一定要有“专家”，要有高楼大厦和完善设备，认为这种大学不能培养出国家需要的人材，那真是痴人说梦。如果按照这种人的想法去办学，在一个县里哪能办得起大学来，在两个月内，十七个省市又哪里能新办起一百三十多所大专学校。这种思想，不可能带来教育事业的大发展，也不可能多快好省地培养又红又专的人材。
    孟津县的同志们冲破了这种迷信思想，依靠群众，敢于办一所规模十分宏伟的大学，这是值得提倡和学习的革命精神。
