    Battle on the Banks of the Xiangsi River
    The Xiangsi Reservoir on the Xiangsi River in Xixiangtang, a suburb of Nanning City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is being jointly built by the Guangxi Nationalities Institute, the Administrative Cadre School, the Agricultural School, and the Political School.

    The Xiangsi Reservoir has been under construction for more than half a month, and the project is progressing at a rapid pace. Middle schools in Nanning City have organized labor brigades to build the reservoir. At the construction site, students from various schools have set up challenges, their hoes are flying, and the streams of people carrying earth are like long dragons coiling around the mountainside. Countless heroes have emerged in the labor. In the South, it is now the end of the rainy season, and they have put forward the slogan "Thunder as a salute, heavy rain as applause, work hard in light rain, work less in heavy rain." At night, there are often nearly a hundred shock troops working.

    After the Xiangsi Reservoir is completed, the annual income from fish farming will be about 300,000 yuan, which can solve more than half of the funding for these four schools. At the same time, it can irrigate tens of thousands of mu of farmland near Xixiangtang, turning more than 4,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields and 4,000 mu of semi-dry land into guaranteed paddy fields.

    相思江畔的战斗
    广西僮族自治区南宁市郊西乡塘相思江上的相思水库，是广西民族学院、行政干校、农校和政治学校联合兴建的。
    相思水库动工已半个多月了，工程正以飞快的速度进行着。南宁市各中学都组织劳动大队去建筑水库。在工地上各学校学生都摆了擂台，人们的锄头在飞舞，挑土的人流好像一条条长龙，盘在山腰。在劳动中涌出无数的英雄。南方，现在正是雨季末期，他们提出“响雷作礼炮，急雨当掌声，小雨大干，大雨小干”的口号。晚上，经常有近百名突击队员在劳动。
    相思水库建成后，每年养鱼收入约三十多万元，可以解决这四个学校一半以上的经费，同时可以灌溉西乡塘附近上万亩田地；使四千多亩旱地变成水田，四千多亩半旱田变成有保障的水田。（吕孟成）
