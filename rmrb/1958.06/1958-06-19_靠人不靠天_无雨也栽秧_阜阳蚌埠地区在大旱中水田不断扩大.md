    Rely on People, Not Heaven: Planting Rice Seedlings Without Rain
    Fuyang and Bengbu Regions Expand Paddy Fields Amidst Severe Drought

    (Our Report) From January to the present, the rainfall in the Fuyang Special District has been less than half of the average year, making the drought situation the worst since liberation. However, the unprecedentedly large-scale project of converting dry land to paddy fields is proceeding as planned. Reservoirs and ponds everywhere are storing water, and the rice seedlings are lush and green.

    What is the reason for this? The water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring have already had an effect on production. It is estimated that the Fuyang Special District will convert more than 4 million mu of land to rice paddy this year, requiring more than 2.1 billion cubic meters of water. From last winter to the present, there has been little rainfall, and relying on the sky is unreliable, with no water available on the ground to store. However, the broad masses in northern Anhui, during the water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, have tapped into the inexhaustible supply of groundwater. The Fuyang Special District moved nearly 2 billion cubic meters of earth in water conservancy projects last winter and this spring. Deep ditches and large ponds have initially formed a water network in many places. Each ditch and pond has been dug four to six meters deep, and most have wells dug within them. Groundwater flows continuously to the surface and is stored in the ditches and ponds. Therefore, even during the driest periods, water is guaranteed for irrigation, seedling cultivation, and transplanting.

    Now, with the wheat harvest basically completed, several hundred thousand mu of stubble rice have already been transplanted. The entire special district has put forward the slogan of "Relying on people, not heaven" and "Relying on groundwater, not rainwater from the sky" to continue the struggle against drought.

    In the past, little rice was grown in northern Anhui, and even less spring rice, because of the lack of rain before June each year, which made it impossible to guarantee water for seedling cultivation and transplanting. This year, the rice acreage in the Fuyang Special District has expanded eightfold compared to last year. By utilizing the groundwater discovered during water conservancy construction, this difficulty has been overcome. This approach has opened up a path for large-scale rice cultivation in the plains north of the Huai River, which are prone to spring and summer droughts.

    (Our Report) The Bengbu Special District of Anhui Province, which spans both sides of the Huai River, has more than 3 million farmers engaged in the struggle against drought and for rush planting every day. With the heroic spirit of "Ensuring a good harvest even if it doesn't rain all year," they are moving forward at a rate of more than 200,000 mu of rice planting per day, despite the severe difficulties of water scarcity.

    This year, the rice planting area in the Bengbu Special District has expanded to more than 10.6 million mu. In particular, the area converted to rice planting in the eight counties north of the Huai River has increased by about eightfold, requiring more rainwater to ensure summer planting. However, rainfall in this area has been scarce for the past five months, with evaporation exceeding rainfall in many places. This has brought difficulties to the large-scale conversion to rice planting. But the farmers in various places have not flinched in the face of the drought. Villages and communes, regardless of men, women, old or young, have risen up to wage war against the drought. The 250,000 farmers in Feidong County, after eight days of hard work, have basically completed the transplanting of 1.04 million mu of rice.

    Recently, the fields have been filled with moving scenes of "people everywhere during the day, and tens of thousands of lights at night." Many agricultural cooperatives have sent shock brigades to set up camps at the rice conversion sites, digging ditches and wells on the spot to fight drought and transplant seedlings. Wu Dingyun, Secretary of the Shagou District Committee of the Huaiyuan County CCP, led more than 3,000 farmers to camp at the rice conversion site, digging ditches to divert water from the Yellow River for irrigation, planting more than 300 mu of seedlings every day. More than 1,500 members of the Jinxin Agricultural Cooperative in Lingbi County set up a large camp at the rice conversion site, digging 175 wells in the fields, pumping water day and night for irrigation, and have already transplanted more than 1,000 mu of seedlings. The farmers in the entire area have made the determination to "Get water from the ground and fight with God for grain," utilizing all available water sources and all tools that can be used for drought resistance. Since the end of May, the entire area has built more than 4,000 river barriers, dug more than 12,000 earthen wells, deepened more than 5,000 existing ditches and ponds, opened more than 20,000 irrigation ditches, extracted groundwater from springs in more than 3,300 places, and dug wells in 4,000 ditches and ponds. In addition to the more than 50,000 waterwheels that are pumping water day and night, more than 350,000 wooden buckets, basins, and other tools that can be used to draw water are also being used. Tractors have also been modified and driven to the fields to pump water for the farmers to fight the drought. On the twelve main rivers in the eight counties north of the Huai River, river barriers have been built to divert water for irrigation. More than 100 members of the Dongmiao Agricultural Cooperative in Huaiyuan County fought hard all night and blocked the Wo River to supply the needs of more than 1,000 mu of converted rice fields in the entire cooperative.

### 靠人不靠天　无雨也栽秧  阜阳蚌埠地区在大旱中水田不断扩大

    靠人不靠天　无雨也栽秧
    阜阳蚌埠地区在大旱中水田不断扩大
    本报讯　阜阳专区从今年1月到目前的降雨量不到一般年份的一半，干旱情况为解放以来所少有；但是空前大规模的旱地改水稻田工作，却按原计划照常进行；沟塘到处蓄了水，秧苗一片葱绿。
    什么原因呢？去冬今春兴修的水利工程在生产中已经发生了作用。据估计，阜阳专区今年改种水稻田四百多万亩，需要水量二十一亿多方。而从去冬到目前，降雨少，天雨靠不上，地上无水可蓄。但是，淮北广大群众在去冬今春兴修水利中，把取之不尽，用之不竭的地下水挖掘出来了。阜阳专区去冬今春兴修水利所做的土方近二十亿，许多地方深沟大塘初步形成了水网，每一个沟塘都挖了四至六公尺深，并在沟塘中大部下了井泉，地下水源源不绝地流出地面，储蓄在沟塘里，因此，在最干旱的时候保证了和田、育秧、栽秧的用水。
    现在，随着麦收的基本结束，麦茬稻已经又插秧了数十万亩，全专区提出了“靠人不靠天”，“靠地下水不靠天上雨”的口号，继续和干旱进行斗争。
    淮北过去种水稻很少，种春稻的更少，这是因为每年6月以前缺雨，不能保证育秧插秧的用水。今年阜阳专区水稻面积比去年扩大八倍，利用兴修水利中挖掘的地下水，便把这一困难克服了。这种做法，为我国淮河以北春夏缺雨的平原地区大规模改种水稻，开辟了道路。
                        （于明）
    本报讯　横跨淮河两岸的安徽省蚌埠专区，每天有三百多万农民投入抗旱抢种斗争。他们以“一年不下雨，也要保丰收”的豪迈气概，在水源缺乏的严重困难下，每天仍以抗旱栽种水稻二十多万亩的速度向前迈进。
    今年蚌埠专区水稻播种面积扩大到一千零六十多万亩，特别是淮河以北八县改种水稻的面积扩大了八倍左右，这就需要更多的雨水来保证夏种。可是这个地区最近五个多月来，降雨量很少，很多地方蒸发量还超过了降雨量。这就给大规模改种水稻带来了困难。但各地农民在旱灾面前并没有畏缩，村村社社，不分男女老幼，都起来向干旱开火。肥东县二十五万农民经过八天苦战，已基本完成一百零四万亩水稻的插秧任务。
    近日来，田野里到处都呈现着“白天满地人，晚上万盏灯”的动人景象。很多农业社都派出突击队，到改种水稻的地方去安营扎寨，就地开沟打井，抗旱栽秧。中共怀远县沙沟区委书记吴定云带领三千多农民驻扎在稻改工地，开沟引黄河水灌溉，每天栽秧三百多亩。灵璧县锦新农业社一千五百多名社员在稻改工地安下大营，在田头打井一百七十五眼，日夜车水灌田，已栽秧一千多亩。全区农民下了“向地下要水，向老天争粮”的决心，凡是能利用的水源都利用上，凡是能用来抗旱的工具也都用起来。全区从5月底以来，已打拦河坝四千多条，打土井一万二千多眼，挖深原有沟塘五千多处，开引水沟两万多条，有三千三百多处下泉取地下水，并在四千处沟塘内打了井。各地除有五万多部水车夜以继日地车水外，还利用了三十五万多个木桶、面盆等一切能提水的工具。拖拉机也经过改装，开到田边为农民车水抗旱。在淮河以北八县的十二条主要河流上，都已节节拦河打坝，引水灌田。怀远县东庙农业社的一百多个社员，苦战一夜，就把涡河水拦蓄起来，供应全社一千多亩改种水稻田的需要。
