Emancipating the Mind is the Best Preparation
A Record of the Liuan County Pidong First Cooperative's Wheat Observation and Appraisal
By Our Correspondent Yu Ming

Arriving at the Pidong First Cooperative truly opens one's mind. Walk around, and you won't see a single bad patch of wheat in the entire cooperative. The wheat stalks are thick and tall, and the ears of wheat are long and large. Each field has a sign indicating estimated yields of seven hundred catties, eight hundred catties… up to one thousand one hundred catties. The visitors looked on with amazement and joy. Several people went into the wheat field and measured one foot square around, counting six hundred and thirty-seven plants. They counted the grains on six ears of different sizes, averaging thirty-five grains per ear.

Based on this calculation, the yield should be eight hundred and forty catties per mu. They went to the edge of the field and looked at the sign, and the estimated yield on the sign was exactly the same as their calculation.

I walked over and sat down in a crowd of people by a small river. Cooperative member Guan Jicai was lecturing here. He talked about politics and also about science and technology.

"Comrades, I am responsible for the management of this wheat field, with an estimated yield of over eight hundred catties per mu. Let's talk about this wheat field!"

"This year, this wheat field is planted with improved varieties, using strip planting, close planting, reasonable fertilization, careful plowing and harrowing, and early pest control…."

"You must be saying that this is all too ordinary. That's right! These are all methods that the Communist Party and the People's Government told us about long ago, but in the past, due to conservative thinking, we didn't implement them properly. Wheat could only yield one or two hundred catties per year. This year, we listened and did everything, and we achieved such a high yield. We suffered greatly from conservative thinking in the past!"

"Let's take strip planting and close planting as an example. We used to broadcast seeds, and later we changed to strip planting. However, the strip planting used a manure-spreading harrow to create the furrows, which resulted in narrow seeding widths, uneven bottoms, seeds crowding together, weak seedlings, and excessively wide row spacing, which wasted land. Last year, after the rectification campaign, everyone demonstrated their enthusiasm and overcame conservative thinking. Cooperative Director Gui Jingyuan came up with a method, based on the principle of the harrow, to create a four-toothed harrow. With it, the seeding width was increased from the original one inch to more than two inches, and the row spacing was reduced from the original six inches to five inches. With the widening of the seeding width, the seeds could be spread more widely and evenly during sowing, and the amount of seed was increased from more than ten catties per mu to more than twenty catties. The reduction in row spacing also fully utilized the land."

I interviewed some people in this cooperative. From their words, I realized how significant this large-scale, high-yield production, this on-site observation and appraisal, is for liberating people's minds, further boosting their enthusiasm, and striving for a great leap forward next year.

Cooperative Director Gui Jingyuan said that they began planting experimental plots on 9.6 mu of land in 1953. In that year, they fought against conservative thinking on the issues of implementing strip planting, close planting, and using improved varieties, achieving an average yield of 446 catties per mu, which was three times higher than the yield of the same type of soil locally. Afterwards, their experimental plots gradually expanded, and the yield of high-yield fields gradually increased. In 1954, more than three mu yielded 758 catties per mu, and in 1957, more than two mu achieved a yield of 902 catties per mu. However, these high yields were always on small areas. This year, the entire cooperative's 2,200 mu of wheat has suddenly increased to more than 800 catties per mu, which has opened up new horizons. He confidently told me two goals to strive for, one being corn after the wheat. Last year, the average yield of wheat in the entire cooperative was only 215 catties. This year, it has jumped to 800 catties. Wheat, which was previously considered a low-yield crop, can be increased by more than two times. What about the high-yield crop corn? They are the high-yield corn cooperative in the province. Last year, the average yield per mu reached more than 400 catties. This year, after harvesting the wheat, they are confident that the average yield of corn will reach 1,000 catties per mu. They want to harvest 1,800 catties per mu from wheat and corn this year. He also calculated another account for me. He found five wheat fields with different yields in this year's wheat fields to calculate the number of plants and grains. If the average number of grains per ear reached 35, the yield of this year would be achieved. This year, there are still many wheat ears with more than 70 grains, and there are still shortcomings such as partial lodging and incomplete deep plowing this year. If these shortcomings are overcome in the autumn-sown wheat, and strip planting and close planting are done even better, so that each ear has more than 70 grains, the entire cooperative will cultivate 30 mu of high-yield wheat fields with a yield of 2,000 catties per mu next year. Gong Cunliang, the district party secretary where this cooperative is located, said that the cooperative originally planned to produce 400 catties per mu this year, which the district committee had not yet approved. Now that they have reached 800 catties, it has inspired the masses in the entire district, and they are preparing to implement 600-700 catties per mu in the entire district next year. The secretary of the Liuan Prefectural Committee also stated at the on-site appraisal meeting that the entire prefecture will also strive to achieve 600 catties of wheat next year.

This is merely the grand plan of Liuan Prefecture from top to bottom after liberating their minds, and they are still in a hilly area. Representatives from Huaibei, the famous wheat-producing area, and representatives from the fertile riverside area also participated in the observation and appraisal. Through this on-site observation, they also expressed that they would make great achievements in rapidly increasing wheat production next year.

The key to preparing for increased wheat production next year lies in liberating people's minds through the current on-site observation and appraisal. This seems to be very important.

### 解放思想是最好的准备  记六安县淠东一社参观评比小麦

    解放思想是最好的准备
    记六安县淠东一社参观评比小麦
    本报记者　于明
    到了淠东一社，真是使人顿开茅塞。你走吧，走遍全社看不到一块孬麦。麦秆又粗又高，麦穗子又长又大。每块田边都插上牌子，写着七百斤，八百斤……一千一百斤。参观的人们看着又惊又喜，有几个人走进麦地里用尺子四周各量一尺，数数共有六百三十七棵，用大小不等的六个穗子数麦粒，平均每穗三十五粒。
    根据这样计算每亩应收八百四十斤。他们到田头找到牌子一看，牌子上估产数，不多不少，和他们估算的完全一样。
    我走进靠小河的一个人堆里坐下来。社员管继才正在这里开讲。他讲的是政治，又讲的是科学技术。
    “同志们，这块小麦是我负责管理的，每亩估产八百多斤。咱就谈谈这块麦田吧！”
    “今年这块麦田种的都是良种，实行了条播密植，合理施肥，还有精耕细耙，提早防治虫害……。”
    “你们一定要说这太普通了，对！这些都是共产党和人民政府早告诉过的办法，可是过去有保守思想，就是没有好好实行，小麦年年只能收一、二百斤，今年我们听话了，都作了，就得到这么高的产量。咱们过去吃保守思想的亏吃大啦！”
    “就拿条播密植的事来谈吧。我们过去也是撒播，后来改成条播，可是条播用捣粪的钉耙拉沟，播幅窄，底不平，种子挤成堆，麦苗不旺，行距过宽，也浪费了土地。去年，经过整风，大家都发挥了干劲，克服了保守思想，社主任桂景元想了个办法，根据钉耙的原理创造了一个四齿耙，就用它把播幅从原来的一寸多增加到二寸多宽，行距从原来六寸缩小到五寸。播幅加宽，播种子时就能撒得开，撒得匀，种子量也从原来每亩十多斤增加到二十多斤；行距缩小，土地也就被充分利用起来。”
    我在这个社里访问了一些人，从他们的话里，我意识到这种大面积的高额丰产，这种现场参观评比，对人们解放思想，更加鼓足干劲，争取明年的大跃进有着多么重大的意义。
    社主任桂景元说：他们在1953年就开始在九亩六分地上种试验田了，他们在这一年实行条播密植和采用良种问题上和保守思想进行了斗争，取得平均亩产四百四十六斤的丰产成绩，比当地同等土质的产量高了三倍。以后他们的试验田逐步扩大，高额丰产田的产量逐步提高，1954年有三亩多收到单产七百五十八斤，1957年有二亩多单产达到九百零二斤。但是这些高额丰产总是小面积的，今年全社二千二百多亩小麦一下提高到每亩八百斤以上，就使眼界豁然开朗了。他信心百倍地告诉了我两个奋斗目标，一个就是小麦以后的玉米。去年全社小麦的平均产量才二百一十五斤，今年一跳跳到八百斤，小麦是过去被人们认为低产的作物，都能这样提高二倍多，那么高产作物玉米呢？他们是全省玉米的高额丰产社，去年平均每亩达到四百多斤，今年收麦后，玉米争取每亩平均达到一千斤就有把握了。他们要在今年的小麦和玉米上每亩就要收到一千八百斤了。他还给我算了另一笔账，他在今年的麦地里找五块不同产量的麦地算棵数和粒数，每穗平均粒数达到三十五粒就达到今年的产量，而今年小麦每穗在七十粒以上的还很多，今年还有部分倒伏，深耕不普遍等的缺点。如果秋播的小麦克服了这些缺点。条播密植更搞得好，使每穗的粒子达到七十粒以上，明年全社就要培养三十亩小麦单产二千斤的高额丰产田了。这个社所在地的区委书记龚存良说，这个社原计划今年亩产四百斤，区委会还没有通过，现在他们达到八百斤，就鼓舞了全区的群众，准备明年在全区也要实行六、七百斤。六安地委书记也在现场评比会上表示，全专区明年也要力争小麦达到六百斤。
    这仅仅是六安专区从上到下解放思想以后的宏图，而他们还是在丘陵山区。参加参观评比的还有著名的产麦地区淮北的代表们，还有土地肥沃的沿江地区的代表们，他们通过这一现场的实地观察，也纷纷表示，要对明年小麦产量的迅速提高做出伟大的成绩来。
    准备明年小麦增产的关键，在于通过目前的现场参观评比，解放人们的思想，这一点看来是十分重要的了。
