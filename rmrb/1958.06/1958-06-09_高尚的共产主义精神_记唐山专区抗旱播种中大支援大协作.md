　　Lofty Communist Spirit
　　——A Record of the Large-Scale Support and Coordination in the Tangshan Region's Drought Resistance and Planting Efforts
　　By Our Correspondent　Li Pu
　　The broad masses of peasants in the Tangshan region, ambitious in the great leap forward in agricultural production, demanded to surpass the Yellow River this year. However, "Heaven" did not cooperate. From September of last year to March of this year, only 56.6 millimeters of rain fell, forming a major spring drought unseen in decades. The people of the Tangshan region did not retreat in the face of the severe drought. Through heroic and tenacious struggle, they overcame the drought, and 1.4 million mu of field crops in the entire region have been planted, and the seedlings have emerged.
　　The communist spirit of sharing weal and woe and mutual support is an important factor in overcoming the drought. Under the leadership of the CPC Tangshan Regional Committee, the people of the entire region displayed a high degree of communist spirit, cooperating and supporting each other, breaking down the boundaries of villages, townships, counties, and even regions. Wherever there was a need, they went there; as long as it was beneficial to the collective, they bravely went forward. Seven counties, including Qianxi, Qian’an, Lulong, Zunhua, Funing, Sanhe, and Pinggu, were severely affected by the drought. Yutian, Leting, Xianghe, and other six counties organized 25,000 people to fight alongside the local people, successfully completing the drought resistance and planting tasks. Kuaizizhuang and Xinfangzi townships in Fengrun County lacked labor and animal power, and it would have taken more than ten days to complete the planting of more than 10,000 mu of land, which would have affected production. Just when they had no solution, the CPC Xuanzhuang District Committee mobilized eight nearby townships, sending 6,000 people, 85 head of livestock, 61 carts, and 350 pieces of various small agricultural tools to support the two townships, successfully completing the planting by May 1st. The more than 3,000 migrant workers from Yutian who supported Sanhe in drought resistance and planting also proposed the following to better help the county complete the drought resistance and planting work: ideologically communized, organizationally militarized, agricultural work standardized, life disciplined, actions combat-oriented, and habits localized.
　　Everyone treated the difficulties of others as their own. Shashi峪 and Yukou villages in Zunhua County were severely affected by the drought. Xin Dianzi District in the plains organized more than 3,000 people to deliver more than 6,000 dan of water from seven li away, enabling the two villages to complete the planting of more than 700 mu of land ahead of schedule and on time. The masses in Qishuzhuang District of Fengrun County automatically carried out the extension and widening of a canal in order to support downstream water use, increasing the water flow by half. When Xin Juntun District was lacking sweet potato seedlings and unable to complete the planting plan, Qian Liujiaying Township extended a hand of friendship, donating 200,000 to 300,000 sweet potato seedlings to the district free of charge. Magusi Village in the mountainous area of Qian’an County had a total of 1,059 people and 83 head of livestock, but only four wells, two of which dried up every spring. Not to mention planting, even people's drinking water was a problem. The Luan County migrant workers who supported the village saw this situation and used their own experience in digging quicksand wells. Thirty-four people worked hard for a day and two nights to dig a four-foot-deep well. In addition, they found a spring and dug a six-zhang-long and three-foot-wide reservoir around it to store water. This not only solved the problem of water for planting 600 mu of sweet potatoes, but also solved the problem of people's drinking water. With grateful hearts, the masses of the village erected monuments with the inscriptions "Qian (an) Luan (county) Friendship Well" and "Qian (an) Luan (county) Friendship Reservoir."

　　高尚的共产主义精神
　　——记唐山专区抗旱播种中大支援大协作
　　本报记者　李朴
    唐山专区广大农民，在农业生产大跃进中雄心勃勃，要求今年就过黄河。可是，“天公”不作美，从去年9月到今年3月，只降下五十六点六公厘雨，形成几十年来所没有过的大春旱。唐山专区人民没有在大旱面前后退，经过英勇顽强的斗争，战胜了干旱，全区一千四百万亩大田作物已经播种完毕，幼苗已经出土。
    患难与共，互相支援的共产主义精神，是战胜旱灾的重要因素。在中共唐山地委的领导下，全区人民发扬了高度的共产主义精神，互相协作、互相支援，打破了村界、乡界、县以至专区界，哪里需要就到哪里，只要对集体有利就勇往直前的作去，迁西、迁安、芦龙、遵化、抚宁、三河、平谷等七个县，干旱严重，玉田、乐亭、香河等六县就组织了两万五千人同当地人民并肩作战胜利完成抗旱播种任务。丰润县侉子庄、新房子两个乡，劳力、畜力不足，要完成一万多亩地的播种，就要延长十多天时间，影响生产，正在没办法的时候，中共宣庄区委发动附近的八个乡，出动六千人，八十五头牲口，六十一辆大车，携带各种小型农具三百五十件，支援该两乡到5月1日即胜利完成播种。玉田支援三河抗旱播种的三千多民工，为更好地帮助该县完成抗旱播种工作，还提出了思想共产主义化、组织军事化、农活标准化、生活纪律化、行动战斗化、习惯当地化。
    人人都把别人的困难，当成自己的困难一样去对待。遵化县沙石峪、峪口两个村干旱严重，平原新店子区就组织了三千多人，从七里远的地方，向他们献水六千多担，使这两个村提前按时完成了七百多亩地的播种。丰润县七树庄区的群众为支援下游用水，自动将一条渠道进行伸长加宽工程，使水增加了半个流量。当新军屯区正在缺乏白薯秧没法完成种植计划的时候，前刘家营乡伸出友谊之手，无代价的献给该区白薯秧二十至三十万棵。迁安县山区马谷寺村共一千零五十九人，八十三头牲口，只有四眼井，其中两眼每到春天就干了，不用说播种，就连人们吃的都发生困难。支援这个村子的滦县民工看到这种情况，就用他们自己打流砂井的经验，三十四人苦干一天两夜，打成一眼四尺深的水井；另外，还找到一个泉，并在周围挖了六丈长、三尺宽的一个水库以便蓄水，这样不但解决了六百亩白薯播种之用水，人们吃水的困难也得到解决。这个村子的群众以感激心情，刻立了“迁（安）滦（县）友谊井”、“迁（安）滦（县）友谊库”的纪念碑。（附图片）
