Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 24th: Jakarta newspapers reported today that since June 21st, the joint forces of the Indonesian government army, with the assistance of the People's Guerrillas, have been advancing on the rebel stronghold of Manado city. Indonesian Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel T. B. Simatupang said that the government army had tightly surrounded Manado, but as of the 23rd, no news of the recapture of Manado had been received.

According to newspaper reports, most of the rebels fighting in the Manado area are so-called "volunteers," the vast majority of whom are students and young people who were lured or threatened into joining the rebels, while another part consists of soldiers who previously served in the Dutch army.

    新华社雅加达24日电　雅加达报纸今天报道，6月21日以来，印度尼西亚政府军的联合部队一直在人民游击队的协助下，向叛军巢穴万鸦老市区进攻。印度尼西亚陆军发言中皮恩加迪中校说，政府军已经严密地包围了万鸦老，但是，到23日为止，还没有收到收复万鸦老的消息。
    据报纸报道，在万鸦老地区作战的叛军中大部分是所谓“志愿军”，其中绝大多数是被诱骗或者被威胁参加叛军的学生和青年，另一部分是以前在荷兰的军队中服役的士兵。
