Be Good at Distinguishing and Treating Different Contradictions
Nie Zhen, Vice President of Renmin University of China

Chairman Mao's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is a major development of Marxism and a major development of materialist dialectics. This theory has significant guiding significance for our revolution and socialist construction. This theory is a summary of the experiences of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement.

In this work, Chairman Mao put forward two types of contradictions: contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and contradictions among the people. Contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic contradictions, major issues of principle, and fundamental issues of political stance. Therefore, when we analyze contradictions, we should first distinguish contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and draw a clear line between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. Only in this way can we avoid making mistakes on major issues of principle. The standards for distinguishing major issues of principle vary in different historical periods. The current standard for distinguishing major issues of principle is the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao. This is a fundamental issue of two roads. The more sensitive we are to this issue, the better. In the early stage of the blooming and contending, many people did not understand this issue and made mistakes. This is a major lesson. Learning to distinguish the problem of the enemy and ourselves will still be an important issue in the future. Therefore, it is very important to emphasize summarizing the experience of the struggle against the enemy today.

Historically, enemies have always been a minority, and the people have always been a majority. Our party unites all forces that can be united, isolates the enemy, and finally eliminates the enemy. Moreover, in the process of eliminating the enemy, we must also pay attention to dividing the enemy. We must always adopt the method of resolutely overthrowing and eliminating the enemy. However, the specific circumstances of the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are different in each historical stage, so the treatment methods are also different. Therefore, today we have not adopted the same method for dealing with bourgeois rightists as we did with landlord elements.

When dealing with complex and intricate contradictions, in principle, we should first distinguish contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, but when dealing with them, should we first deal with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, or should we first deal with contradictions among the people? This is not absolute. It mainly depends on the specific circumstances of the contradictions. The Party's rectification movement was originally intended to deal with contradictions among the people, but the bourgeois rightists took the opportunity of the Party's rectification to launch a frenzied attack, which elevated the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy to a primary position. Therefore, we had to solve the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy first. But this is not the case in some places. For example, some factories did not solve the problem of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy first in the blooming and contending debates at that time.

The principle of handling contradictions among the people is fundamentally different from that of handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and the experience in handling contradictions among the people has also developed greatly in the past year compared with the past. Furthermore, contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people are interrelated and interact with each other. When contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are resolved, the people are tempered in the struggle against the enemy, their awareness is raised, and contradictions among the people are easier to handle. Conversely, if contradictions among the people are handled correctly, it will be more conducive to the struggle against the enemy.

The people are also divided into left, middle, middle-left, and middle-right. The people should also be treated differently. The criteria for distinguishing between left, middle, middle-left, and middle-right are mainly the struggle against the enemy. Distinguishing them based on their ability to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and based on their political attitude towards the enemy and ourselves.

There are contradictions among the people, and there are many kinds, but they can be summarized into three types: (1) The struggle between two roads, that is, the class struggle, mainly manifested as the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (including contradictions and struggles on the economic, political, and ideological fronts; this kind of contradiction is both antagonistic and non-antagonistic). (2) The reflection of class struggle, that is, the reflection of bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology within the proletariat, which causes contradictions between two different ideologies within the proletariat. (3) Contradictions that do not belong to the category of class, that is, contradictions between the subjective and the objective, the correct and the wrong, and the advanced and the backward (which are also affected by class relations in class society). This kind of contradiction will continue to arise and be resolved even in the proletarian communist society. Therefore, there will still be frequent political struggles and continuous revolutions at that time.

Since the rectification and anti-rightist campaign, because we have correctly handled the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and various contradictions among the people, the masses have been fully mobilized, and the revolutionary drive of the whole party and the whole people has soared to the sky, achieving a comprehensive great leap forward in all work. This is the victory of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the thought of Chairman Mao, and the victory of the doctrine of correctly handling contradictions among the people. We must resolve contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and correctly handle contradictions among the people in order to better implement the general line of socialist construction of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    要善于区别和对待不同矛盾
    中国人民大学副校长　聂真
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的理论，是马克思主义的重大发展，是唯物辩证法的重大发展。这一理论对我们的革命和社会主义建设，有着重大的指导意义。这一理论是中国革命和国际共产主义运动的经验总结。
    毛主席在这一篇著作中提出了两类矛盾，即：敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。敌我矛盾是对抗性的矛盾，是大是大非的问题，是根本政治立场的问题。因此，当我们分析矛盾时，首先应区分敌我矛盾，划清香花与毒草的界限。只有这样，我们在大是大非的问题上才不会犯错误。大是大非的标准，在各个历史时期有所不同。现阶段划分大是大非的标准是毛主席提出的六条标准。这是两条道路的根本问题。在这一问题上嗅觉越敏锐越好。在鸣放初期，有许多人弄不清这一问题，而犯了错误，这是一个很大的教训。学会划清敌我问题，今后仍是重要问题，因此，在今天强调总结对敌斗争的经验是十分重要的。
    从历史上看，敌人总是少数，人民总是多数。我们党团结一切可以团结的力量，孤立敌人，最后消灭敌人。而且在消灭敌人的过程中，也还要注意分化敌人。对敌人总是要采取坚决打倒而消灭之的办法的。但是，各个历史阶段的敌我矛盾具体情况不同，因而对待方法也就有所不同。所以今天我们对资产阶级右派，就没有采取对待地主分子那样的方法。
    在处理错综复杂的矛盾时，在原则上应首先划清敌我矛盾，但是，在处理时，是首先处理敌我矛盾呢？还是首先处理人民内部矛盾？这不是绝对的。主要还是看矛盾的具体情况。这次党的整风运动本来是要处理人民内部矛盾的，但是资产阶级右派，却乘党整风之机，发动了猖狂进攻，这就使敌我矛盾升到首要地位，因此，我们不得不先解决敌我矛盾。而有些地方并不是这样。比如有些工厂在当时的鸣放辩论中就没有首先解决敌我矛盾的问题。
    处理人民内部矛盾在原则上与处理敌我矛盾根本不同，而且处理人民内部矛盾的经验，一年来比过去也有很大发展。再者，敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾是互相关联、互相作用的。敌我矛盾解决了，人民在对敌斗争中，得到了锻炼，觉悟提高了，人民内部矛盾就更好处理了。反之，人民内部矛盾正确处理了，更有利于对敌斗争。
    人民也有左、中、中左、中右之分。对人民也要分别对待。区分左、中、中左、中右的标准，主要是对敌斗争。依据其识别香花和毒草的能力，依据其对敌我的政治态度而区分之。
    人民内部有矛盾，而且种类很多，但是归结起来有三种：（一）两条道路的斗争，即阶级斗争，主要表现为资产阶级和无产阶级的斗争（包括经济战线、政治战线、思想战线上的矛盾和斗争，这种矛盾既有对抗性的，又有非对抗性的）。（二）阶级斗争的反映，也就是资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想在无产阶级内部的反映，致使无产阶级内部发生两种不同思想意识的矛盾。（三）不属于阶级范畴的，主观与客观、正确与错误、先进与落后的矛盾（在阶级社会中也受阶级关系的影响）。这种矛盾就是到无产阶级的共产主义社会还是会不断产生不断解决的。因此，那时还是经常有政治斗争，以及不断发生革命。
    整风反右派以来，由于我们正确地处理了敌我矛盾和人民内部各种矛盾，群众充分发动起来了，全党全民的革命干劲冲天，获得了全面工作大跃进。这是党中央领导和毛主席思想的胜利，是正确处理人民内部矛盾学说的胜利。我们必须解决敌我矛盾，并且正确处理人民内部矛盾，才能更好地贯彻多快好省的社会主义建设总路线。
