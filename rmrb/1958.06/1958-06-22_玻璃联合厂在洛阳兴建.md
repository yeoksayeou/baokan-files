    Glass United Factory to be Built in Luoyang
    (Our Dispatch) A large-scale glass united factory has recently commenced construction in Luoyang, Henan. This factory was designed by our own country. Once fully completed, it will annually produce over one million cases of plate glass, tempered glass, laminated glass, polished glass, and other specialized technical glass. In addition, it will also produce large quantities of glass silk, glass wool, and fiberglass reinforced plastic, among other glass fiber products.
    The original plan was to start construction on this factory in 1959. Promoted by the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, construction was advanced to this year, and it is planned to gradually commence production in the second half of 1960. (Bolang)

    玻璃联合厂在洛阳兴建
    本报讯  一座大型的玻璃联合工厂最近在河南洛阳动工兴建。这个厂是由我国自己设计的，全部建成后，每年将生产一百多万箱平板玻璃，钢化玻璃、夹层玻璃、磨光玻璃及其他特种技术玻璃，此外还要生产大量的玻璃丝、玻璃棉及玻璃钢等玻璃纤维等。
    这个厂原计划是1959年开始建设的，在工农业大跃进的形势促进下，提前在今年建设，并计划在1960年下半年开始陆续投入生产。（波浪）
