Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 18th: The Gansu Province's 引洮 (Yin Tao) River Diversion Project, comparable to China's canals, officially and comprehensively commenced construction on the 17th. More than 12,000 people held a grand commencement ceremony in Gucheng Village, Minxian County.

Representatives of migrant workers, administrative cadres, and technical staff from the Engineering Bureau and ten work zones, carrying letters of determination, guarantees, and challenge letters, and bringing with them advanced production tools they had created and modified, came to present them to the conference as gifts.

At precisely 10:00 AM, the blasting of the mountains replaced the celebratory cannons, and the conference began amidst the singing of "The East is Red." At the meeting, Li Peifu, Deputy Director of the 引洮 Water Conservancy Project Committee, delivered a speech. Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, and Deng Baoshan, Governor of Gansu Province, spoke successively. Chang Yongfu, a representative of the migrant workers, and Yang Ziying, a representative of the engineering and technical personnel, expressed the determination of all migrant workers and engineering and technical personnel to resolutely complete the project. Finally, Zhang Jiangang, Director of the 引洮 Water Conservancy Project Bureau, announced the construction plan.

Following this, Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, and more than 100 Party and government leaders from the Provincial Committee, the Governor, Vice Governors, and various provincial units, participated in the labor of digging the earth for the 引洮 project.

The Tao River originates from the northern foothills of the Minshan Mountains in southern Gansu Province. The 引洮 River Diversion Project involves damming the Tao River at Gucheng Village, Minxian County, at an altitude of 2,250 meters above sea level, diverting it north and east to the Dongzhi tableland within Qingyang County, at an altitude of 1,400 meters, with a total length of more than 1,100 kilometers. This will allow for the full utilization of the Tao River water, irrigating 15 million to 20 million mu of land, and is estimated to increase grain production by 4.5 billion jin. At the same time, its 850-meter drop can be used to generate more than 300,000 kilowatts of electricity, achieving rural electrification.

    引洮河上山工程正式动工
    据新华社兰州18日电  可与我国运河比美的甘肃省引洮（河）上山工程17日正式全面动工，一万二千多人在岷县古城村举行了隆重的开工典礼。
    从工程局和十个工区来的民工、行政干部、技术工作人员的代表，高举着决心书、保证书、挑战书，携带着他们创造和改制的先进生产工具，来向大会献礼。
    十时正，开山炸药接连轰鸣，代替了礼炮，大会在“东方红”的歌声中开始。会上，引洮水利工程副主任委员李培福致词，中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良、甘肃省省长邓宝珊等相继讲话。民工代表常永福和工程技术人员代表杨子英分别代表全体民工和工程技术人员表示坚决完成工程的决心。最后由引洮水利工程局局长张建纲宣布了施工计划。
    接着，中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良和省委书记、省长、副省长以及省级各单位的一百多名党政负责人，都参加劳动，为引洮工程挖土。
    洮河发源于甘肃省南部岷山的北麓。引洮河水上山的工程，就是在洮河上游海拔二千二百五十公尺的岷县古城村，把洮河水拦住，使它转北向东，流到海拔一千四百公尺的庆阳县境内的董志塬，长达一千一百多公里，这样就可把洮河水充分利用起来，能灌溉一千五百万亩到二千万亩的土地，估计可增产粮食四十五亿斤；同时，还可利用它的八百五十公尺的落差水，发电三十多万瓩，实现农村电气化。
