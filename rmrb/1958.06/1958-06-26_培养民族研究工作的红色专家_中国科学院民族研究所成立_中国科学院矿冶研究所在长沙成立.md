Xinhua News Agency Report: The Institute of Ethnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been formally established. The inaugural meeting was held in Beijing on the 23rd.

Wang Feng, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, attended the meeting to congratulate the establishment of the Institute of Ethnology and delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: The establishment of the Institute of Ethnology marks a new stage of development in the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic research work. This is a major event in our country's scientific research work and also a major event in our country's ethnic work. As early as the founding period of the Chinese Communist Party, especially during the Yan'an period, our Party studied ethnic issues using the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Since the national liberation, ethnic research work has also made great progress and achieved remarkable results. Wang Feng then pointed out that in ethnic research work, there are still struggles between two roads and two ideologies: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, and socialism and nationalism. There are serious erroneous tendencies in ethnic research work of being divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, and divorced from reality. The root of these erroneous tendencies is inseparable from the bourgeois individualism and nationalistic erroneous ideas of some people. He said that these erroneous tendencies must be seriously and thoroughly criticized and corrected.

Wang Feng said that the purpose of ethnic research work must be to benefit the solution of ethnic problems, to benefit ethnic unity, and to benefit the interests of the people of all ethnic groups. In short, it is to serve the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, the research method must be closely linked with the masses and closely linked with reality. He said that every ethnic researcher should have a firm proletarian stand, a work style of close contact with the masses, and should earnestly transform themselves. Ethnic issue research is a long-term task. In addition to well organizing the existing research forces, special attention should also be paid to cultivating a group of red experts in this field from among young people.

Personnel from the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Institute of Minority Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other departments attended the inaugural meeting.

Soviet expert Professor Cheboksarov also attended to offer congratulations.

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Institute of Mining and Metallurgy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was recently formally established in Changsha.

The task of the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is to focus on the research of mining, mineral processing, and non-ferrous metal smelting, while appropriately considering the research of ferrous metal smelting. This institute began preparations for establishment in Changsha in July 1955. During the preparation period, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and higher authorities, the assistance of relevant fraternal units, and the efforts of all staff, it has undertaken more than a dozen important national research tasks and some local research tasks in Hunan, Zhejiang, and other provinces. Now, all the staff are working hard and striving to achieve research results quickly along the road of being both red and expert.

    培养民族研究工作的红色专家
    中国科学院民族研究所成立
    中国科学院矿冶研究所在长沙成立
    据新华社讯　中国科学院民族研究所正式成立。23日在北京举行了成立大会。
    中共中央统战部副部长、民族事务委员会副主任汪锋到会祝贺民族研究所的成立，并在大会上讲了话。他说：民族研究所的成立，标志着中国共产党的民族研究工作进入了新的发展阶段，这是我国科学研究工作方面的一件大事，同时也是我国民族工作方面的一件大事。早在中国共产党的创立时期，特别是在延安时期，我们党就用马克思列宁主义的原理研究民族问题。全国解放以后，民族研究工作方面也有了很大进展，并取得显著成绩。汪锋接着指出，在民族研究工作中还存在着无产阶级与资产阶级，社会主义与资本主义，社会主义与民族主义的两条道路和两种思想的斗争问题。民族研究工作中有严重的脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的错误倾向，这种错误倾向的根源是和一部分人的资产阶级个人主义、民族主义的错误思想分不开的。他说，这种错误倾向必须得到认真的彻底的批判和纠正。
    汪锋说，民族研究工作的目的，必须是有利于解决民族问题，有利于民族团结，有利于各民族人民的利益，总之，它是为社会主义建设事业服务的。因此，研究的方法就必须是密切地联系群众和联系实际。他说，每个民族研究工作者要具有坚定的无产阶级立场，要有密切联系群众的工作作风，要认真地改造自己。民族问题研究是一项长期的任务，除了很好地组织现有的研究力量外，还要特别注意从青年中培养出一批这方面的红色专家。
    参加成立大会的，有全国人民代表大会民族委员会、中央民族事务委员会、中央民族学院、中国科学院少数民族语言研究所等部门的工作人员。
    到会祝贺的还有苏联专家切博克沙洛夫教授。
    据新华社讯　中国科学院矿冶研究所最近在长沙正式成立。
    中国科学院矿冶研究所的任务是以采矿、选矿和有色金属冶炼的研究为主，适当兼顾黑色金属冶炼的研究。这个研究所从1955年7月开始在长沙筹建。在筹建期间，由于党和上级的正确领导、各有关兄弟单位的协助和全体工作人员的努力，已担负起十多项国家重要研究任务和湖南、浙江等省一些地方研究任务。现在全所人员正鼓足干劲，沿着红透专深的道路，力争迅速得出研究成果。
