　　New Bedding Stable Method

　　After five months of experimentation, the Shengxing Agricultural Cooperative in JianShui County, Yunnan Province, has created a record of accumulating more than 42,000 jin of fertilizer per cow per month.

　　This bedding stable method involves multiple layers of bedding and frequent removal. They add bedding every three days and remove the bedding every ten days, each time layering crushed grass, fertile soil, and ash from the stove in twenty layers each. Each layer of grass does not exceed two centimeters, and each layer of soil does not exceed one centimeter in thickness, then soaked with human urine and diluted lime water. In this way, one cow and one stable can produce more than 14,000 jin of fertilizer every ten days. Using this method of bedding, it generally only takes two or three days to generate heat and turn black, and ten days to become mature stable manure. The Shengxing Cooperative also conducted the same experiments in horse and pig stables, proving that each horse can accumulate at least 30,000 jin of fertilizer per year, and each pig can accumulate 50,000 jin of fertilizer per year.

　　Tractor Station Serves Herdsmen

　　The first tractor station on the Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia has sown more than 3,300 mu of feed crops such as oats, alfalfa, and potatoes for nearby pastoral cooperatives for the first time. This tractor station began construction in April this year.

　　In the past, herders in the Hulunbuir League pastoral area had no habit of planting feed and were unable to store much fodder. After the establishment of the tractor station this year, in addition to opening up feed bases, it is planned to store 12.8 million jin of fodder for herders, and also teach the Mongolian, Ewenki, and other ethnic groups in the pastoral areas to develop and utilize water sources, improve pastures, and settle nomadic technology.

　　Thyroid Removal: Pigs Gain Four Jin a Day

　　The Non-Staple Food Management Department of the Yuyao County Commercial Bureau in Zhejiang Province has conducted several experiments on fattening pigs. Recently, they created a new fattening method: surgically removing the thyroid gland from the pig's neck with a common surgical knife. Each pig can gain more than four jin per day. According to experimental observations, the day after the thyroid gland is removed, the pig's temperament changes from lively and restless to unusually docile, fond of sleeping and lazy, unwilling to move, with completely normal appetite and body temperature, and rapid wound healing. Generally, veterinarians and experienced agricultural cooperative epidemic prevention personnel can perform the removal work as long as they have iodine, a knife, pliers, and sewing needle and thread.

    新的垫厩法
    云南省建水县圣兴农业社经过五个月的试验，创造了一牛一厩每月积肥四万二千多斤的纪录。
    这种垫厩法是多垫勤出，分层垫厩。他们每三天垫厩一次，十天除厩一次，每次垫碎草、肥土、灶灰等各二十层，每层草不超过两公分、土不超过一公分厚，再用人尿和淡石灰水浇透。这样，一牛一厩每十天就可出肥一万四千多斤。用这种办法垫厩，一般只要两三天就可发热转黑，十天就可成为熟厩肥。圣兴社还在马厩和猪厩里进行了同样的试验，证明每匹马每年至少可积肥三万斤、每头猪每年可积肥五万斤。
    拖拉机站为牧民服务
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上第一个拖拉机站第一次为附近各牧业社播种了三千三百多亩燕麦、苜蓿、土豆等饲料作物。这个拖拉机站是今年4月开始筹建起来的。
    过去，呼伦贝尔盟牧区牧民没有种植饲料的习惯，也无力打贮很多饲草。今年拖拉机站建立后，除开辟饲料基地外，准备为牧民打贮一千二百八十万斤饲草，还要教给牧区蒙古、鄂温克等族人民开发与利用水源，改良牧场和定居游牧的技术。（以上据新华社消息摘编）
    割掉甲状腺  生猪一天长四斤
    浙江余姚县商业局副食品经理部，进行了好几种生猪催肥方法的试验，最近他们创造了一种新的催肥法：用普通的手术开刀将猪颈部的甲状腺摘出，每天猪可增重四斤以上。据试验观察，甲状腺割除后第二天猪的性情由活泼急燥转变为异常温驯、喜睡懒觉，不愿走动，食欲体温完全正常，伤口愈合很快。一般兽医和有经验的农业社防疫员，只要有碘酒、小刀、钳子、缝衣针线就可进行割除工作。（朱金虎）
