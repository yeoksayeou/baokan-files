　　The Light in the Garret Room
　　Zhou Ke
　　Sister Lu was really strange. Living in downtown Shanghai, she had bright and convenient electric lights available but persistently used a small kerosene lamp year after year. Every night, the dim yellow light from her garret window, compared to the strong electric lights around it, was truly out of place.

　　Could Sister Lu not afford electric lights? Obviously not. Her husband, Old Wu, was a worker at a canvas factory, and his monthly salary was more than enough to support his wife, daughter, and himself. Moreover, electric lights weren't much more expensive than kerosene lamps. So, did Sister Lu just prefer kerosene lamps? Not really. In the past few years, whenever kerosene was in short supply, she would grumble, "This 'old-fashioned lamp' is such a nuisance!" However, whenever a neighbor suggested she install an electric light, she would always refuse outright.

　　Sister Lu's kerosene lamp had long been a small but persistent mystery among the residents in the neighborhood.

　　One spring afternoon thirteen years ago, in a two-story building along the street in the Old City God Temple district, two women were arguing fiercely. Sister Lu said angrily, "Our electric light bulb is broken again! You use the bellows and heat the irons on the rooftop every day, and you've vibrated and broken who knows how many of my light bulbs!" Sister Zhou, who lived on the third floor, also had her reasons: "A'da's grandfather is a tailor; how can he do without heating the irons?" Sister Lu retorted, "Can't you heat the irons a little more gently? You clearly know that my room is under the rooftop. Aren't you bullying me for being honest and deliberately making things difficult?" Sister Zhou sneered, "In this day and age, three copper coins rent a room; I'll do as I please." ... This argument went on and on, and from then on, Sister Lu was determined to prove a point and had the perfectly good electric light removed.

　　Coincidentally, that summer was particularly hot. Sister Lu was suffocating in the garret room while using a coal stove, so she went to the stairwell to cook. This stairwell was the only way for the Zhou family to go downstairs. When Sister Zhou saw the stove placed there, she was already somewhat annoyed. One day, Sister Zhou's youngest son accidentally rolled down the stairs from the third floor and fell beside the burning coal stove, spilling a pot of broad bean soup all over his feet. When Sister Zhou saw her son was scalded, she was both distressed and anxious and began to scold. Although Sister Lu knew she was at fault for injuring the child, she had held a grudge in her heart and refused to give in, so she retorted. After this incident, the feud between the two families deepened. Every two or three days, they would argue over the smallest things. Wives influenced husbands, and even Master Zhou and Old Wu ignored each other when they met. Neighbors so close became worse than strangers.

　　In the early days after liberation, Sister Lu participated in neighborhood work and her understanding improved somewhat. However, when people advised her to improve her relationship with Sister Zhou, she bristled and said, "Not arguing after liberation is achievable, but asking me to reconcile with her is absolutely impossible." Later, Sister Zhou became the security committee member of the residents' committee and also the head of the residents' group. Sister Lu used the excuse of poor health and no longer participated in neighborhood work. Sister Zhou thought that as a neighborhood activist, she should unite with Sister Lu. However, when she thought of the various unpleasantness of the past decade, she found it difficult to overcome. Therefore, whenever there was a group meeting, she had to ask someone else to notify Sister Lu. As for Sister Lu, she would attend, but she just wouldn't speak to the group leader. The residents of the same group and the residents' committee spent a lot of effort on their affair, but they felt helpless.

　　This March, the flames of rectification in the neighborhood were burning fiercely: big-character posters, speaking out meetings, major rectification and reforms, and major debates, one wave after another. The neighborhood wanted to make a Great Leap Forward, everyone wanted to make a Great Leap Forward, and the slogan of "six goods" centered on building the country and running the household through diligence and thrift was spread everywhere... All of this swirled in the minds of Sister Zhou and Sister Lu every day: Saying "six goods" could not be separated from neighborhood unity. What should be done? Sister Zhou woke up every morning and said to herself, "I must call out to her today!" But when they met, it was really difficult! She kept looking at Sister Lu's face, and the opportunities slipped away one by one. Every time Sister Lu went downstairs and met Sister Zhou coming up from below, her heart would beat fast, and she would say to herself, "Call her, call her, call her!" The words reached her lips, but she swallowed them back. "Why should I call out first?" She moved to the side of the stairs, looking elsewhere. In this way, the two played hide-and-seek for several days.

　　Finally, one day, Sister Lu was about to go downstairs when she suddenly heard Sister Zhou calling her son at the bottom of the stairs. Sister Lu saw that she was carrying a bucket of water in one hand and a rice washing basket and a vegetable basket in the other, knowing that she was asking her son for help, but her son was not there. Sister Lu's face turned red, thinking that she must not miss this opportunity. She hurriedly ran downstairs, summoning all her courage: "Let me help you carry it!" "Ah... thank you!" Sister Zhou smiled at Sister Lu, but Sister Lu couldn't say anything. In the afternoon, Sister Zhou ran to the garret room: "Sister Lu, we are discussing the six goods plan today; let's go together?" "Okay!" Sister Zhou said again: "We have reconciled this time, let's sign a sisterhood agreement, shall we?" "Okay, that's what I thought too!" Sister Lu also smiled.

　　The story hasn't ended yet. The day after Sister Lu and Sister Zhou were commended at the residents' meeting, Sister Zhou had an emergency at her old home in the countryside and left in a hurry. When Sister Lu came back and found out about this, she ran to the third floor and said to Master Zhou: "Don't worry. I'll cook for you these few days, take care of the children, and tidy up the place." Without waiting for his reply, she busily prepared dinner for him. Master Zhou remembered that he had heard a long time ago that Sister Lu's sewing machine had some problems, so he silently took his tools and repaired the machine in the garret room. In the evening, he also wrote a letter to his wife, telling her that Sister Lu was taking care of the house, and she didn't need to worry about it in the countryside. ...

　　Yesterday evening, for the first time in thirteen years, the neighbors saw bright electric light shining from the glass window of the garret room.

　　亭子间的灯光
　　周珂
    陆大姐实在古怪，住在上海市区，放着又明亮又方便的电灯不用，却长年累月的点着一盏小煤油灯。每到晚上，她那亭子间窗子里透出来的昏黄灯光，和周围强烈的电灯光对照，实在太不相称。
    陆大姐点不起电灯吗？显然不是。她丈夫老吴，是帆布厂的工人，每月工资供养妻子、女儿，连自己三个人，足足有余。而且，电灯也并不比煤油灯贵多少。那么，陆大姐是偏爱煤油灯吗？也不是。前几年，每当煤油缺货的时候，她就要唠叨：这个“老式灯”，真教人心烦哪！不过，邻居劝她装盏电灯时，她总是一口就回绝。
    陆大姐的煤油灯，长期来，在附近居民中成了一个不大不小的谜。
    十三年前的一个春天午后，在邑庙区一幢沿街二层楼的屋子里，两位妇女吵得正凶：陆大姐气忿忿地说：“我们家的电灯泡又坏啦，你们每天在露台顶上打风箱生熨斗，乒乒乓乓的震坏我的电灯泡不知有几个啦！”住在三层櫊的周大嫂也有理由，“阿大他爷做裁缝，不生熨斗还行？”陆大姐反驳：“生熨斗，不可以轻一点吗？你明明知道露台下面是我的屋子，你不是欺我老实，故意为难吗？”周大嫂冷笑一声：“这年头三个铜钱租间屋，我爱怎样便怎样。”……这场架吵得个没休没完，从此陆大姐就下定决心，拼口气，把好好的电灯给拆掉啦。
    说也凑巧，这一年夏天，天气特别热，陆大姐在亭子间里烧煤炉，闷得吃不消，便到楼梯口上去烧饭，这楼梯口原是周家下楼必经之路，周大嫂见炉子放在这里，心里已有三分气。有一天上午，周大嫂的小儿子一个不小心，从三层櫊的楼梯上滚了下去，跌在烧得正旺的煤炉旁，一锅豆瓣汤全倒在脚上。周大嫂一见儿子烫伤，又疼又急，便骂开了。陆大姐虽然知道伤了孩子自己理亏，但积怨在心，怎肯忍气，也回骂起来。这一次以后，两家的仇就深了。三天两日，碰到一点鸡毛蒜皮，两人就吵将起来。妻子影响丈夫，连周师傅和老吴见了面也相互不理了。近在咫尺的贴隔壁竟比陌生人还不如了。
    解放初，陆大姐曾参加里弄工作，认识有了些提高，但是人家一劝她要改善和周大嫂的关系时，她便作色说：“解放后不吵架可以做到，要我和她去和好，万万不能。”后来，周大嫂当了居民委员会治安保卫委员，兼居民小组长，陆大姐就推说身体不好，不再搞里弄工作。周大嫂想，自己是里弄积极分子，该去团结陆大姐，然而一想到十年来的种种不愉快，也觉难以消除，于是每逢开小组会，只好辗转请人去通知陆大姐；陆大姐呢，去是去了，就是不和组长开口。同组居民和居委会为她们两人的事花了不少气力，也感到没办法。
    今年3月，里弄整风之火熊熊地烧了起来，大字报呀，鸣放会呀，大整大改呀，大辩论呀，一个接一个的热潮。里弄要大跃进，每个人要大跃进，以勤俭建国、勤俭持家为中心的“六好”口号到处传……这一切在周大嫂和陆大姐的脑子里整天翻滚：说“六好”，离不了邻里团结，这可怎么办呢？周大嫂每天清早醒来，就对自己说：“今天一定要去喊她！”可是一见了面，真难啊！她尽拿眼睛去望陆大姐面色，机会就一个一个地滑过去了。陆大姐每次下楼碰到周大嫂从下面上来时，心就通通地跳，暗自说：“叫她吧，叫她，叫她！”话到了嘴边，又咽下了肚，“为什么要我先叫呢？”她往楼梯这边让一让，眼睛望着别处。就这样，两人捉迷藏似地闹了好几天。
    终于有一天，陆大姐正要下楼，忽听周大嫂在楼梯脚边叫儿子。陆大姐见她一手拎了一桶水，一手拿了掏米箩、小菜篮，知道她叫儿子帮忙，可是儿子不在。陆大姐脸上唰地红了起来，心想千万不能错过这机会，急急忙忙地跑了下去，鼓起全部勇气：“我帮你拿吧！”“啊……谢谢你！”周大嫂望着陆大姐笑了笑，陆大姐却什么话都说不出来了。下午，周大嫂跑到亭子间去：“陆大姐，今天讨论六好规划，我们一起去吧？”“好的！”周大嫂又说：“我们这回重新和好了，一起订个姊妹合同好不好？”“好呀，我也这么想呢！”陆大姐也笑了。
    故事还没有最后结束。当居民大会上表扬陆大姐和周大嫂的第二天，周大嫂乡下老家有急事，匆匆地走了。陆大姐回来知道这事，连忙跑到三层櫊上对周师傅说：“你不要急，这几天我帮你烧饭，照料孩子，收拾地方。”不等他回答，就忙忙地给他准备晚饭去了。周师傅却想起很早之前曾听说陆大姐的缝纫机有些毛病，就一声不响地拿了工具，到亭子间里把机子收拾了一番。晚上，还写封信告诉老婆，家里有陆大姐照顾，叫她在乡下不必记挂。……
    昨天晚上，邻居们十三年来第一次看见，亭子间的玻璃窗上射出了通明的电灯光。
