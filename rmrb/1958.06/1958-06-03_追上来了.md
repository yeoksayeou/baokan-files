　　Last Sunday, something new happened in Dongdan Square. A small stage was set up in the poplar grove, two chi high and two zhang wide, with the words "Beijing People's Art Theater Street Performance Team" on a green backdrop. On stage were some comrades, including the nationally renowned Shu Xiuwen. The audience included old ladies, children, chefs in aprons, and workers on bicycles, totaling one or two hundred people. The wind was strong, and the sun was fierce, but the performers performed, and the audience watched, all with great interest, because the performances were about things happening around them: hygiene inspections and street rectification. After more than an hour, the play ended, and the set and actors, all in one vehicle, drove to Tianqiao for another performance.
　　Not long ago, the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe's move from the boudoir and garden to the streets caused some drama troupes to be taken aback. Fortunately, they didn't just stay stunned. Within a few days, the Beijing People's Art Theater and several other units caught up. Their first act was to send out the mainstays of the theater, launching a successful start, and everyone applauded.
　　While street theater is certainly not new, the streets are indeed a place where drama can flourish and develop. Unfortunately, this trend has been shelved for years. One of the reasons is the gradual separation from life. It seems to be the pursuit of a profound and distant artistic realm, but in fact, its own life is showing signs of a lack of nourishment. Looking back to last year, performances were limited to theaters, and most of the plays were about the past. Naturally, some people watched, but mostly not workers, peasants, and soldiers. The passionate scenes of "Put Down Your Whip," where one song resonated with ten thousand responses, and both performers and audiences drew strength from it, were probably unattainable. But now, such scenes have reappeared. Of course, the emotions are different, because the former was sorrow and indignation, while the latter is joy. Constantly looking backward is naturally not good, but occasionally looking back at the path we've taken will clarify our direction and strengthen our confidence in moving forward.
　　The significance of street performances is far more than just adding a new form of performance. From what is performed, how it is performed, and the audience's most favorable reactions, it will actually greatly promote the creation of realistic plays and will also more directly and quickly help to establish and enrich performing arts that are loved and appreciated by the working people. This undoubtedly has great significance for better portraying our new era of mass heroes.
　　I heard that several large theaters will be doing street performances regularly. Good! This is a sign that an unprecedented era of dramatic prosperity is about to arrive!

　　追上来了
　　齐东野
    星期日，东单广场有桩新鲜事，杨树丛中搭起一座小台，高及二尺，宽及两丈，一块绿平片上几个字：北京人艺街头演出队，台上演戏的有知名全国的舒绣纹等一些同志，看戏的有老太太、小孩、带着围裙的大师傅，骑自行车的工人，总有一二百人，风不小，太阳也正毒，但，演的照演，看的照看，大家全都津津有味，因为演的就是身边事：查卫生、街道整风。一个多钟头戏散了，连景加人一辆车开到天桥，又是一场。
    前不久，杭州越剧团下绣楼出花园走向街头的行动，使得有些戏剧团体为之一怔，好处是并没有就此怔住，没几天，北京人艺和别的几个单位就追上来了，头一阵，就摆出了剧院的主将，一炮打响，大家拍手叫好。
    话剧上街固然并非自今日始，街头正是话剧兴隆发挥之地，但遗憾的是此风确也搁置有年了，原因甚多，其中之一是逐渐与生活隔绝，看来似是追求深邃幽远的艺术境界，其实本身生命正渐现缺乏营养的症候，试看去年今日，演戏只限于剧场，剧目大半写过去，自然也有人看，但工农兵劳动人民大抵不多，欲求当年“放下你的鞭子”时，一唱万和，演者观者都从中吸取到力量的热辣辣的场面，大概是不可得的。但是如今，这种场面又重现了，当然，感情不同了，因为前者是悲愤，而后者是欢乐。平时总往后看自然没好处，但偶而回顾一下来路，却是会明确方向坚定走向前去的信心的。
    街头演出的意义，绝不止于增加了一种演出方式而已。从演什么，怎样演，观众才最喜欢的反应当中，实际上将会大大地促进现实剧的创作，也会更直接和更迅速地帮助建立和丰富为劳动人民所喜见乐闻的表演艺术，对于更好地表现我们这个新的群众英雄时代，无疑地这都是有很大意义的。
    听说几个大剧院都将经常不断地做街头演出了，好！这正是一个前所未有的戏剧繁荣时代即将到来的征兆！
