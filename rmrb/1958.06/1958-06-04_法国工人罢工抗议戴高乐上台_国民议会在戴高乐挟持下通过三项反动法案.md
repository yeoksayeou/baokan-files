Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 3rd: A wave of worker strikes protesting De Gaulle's rise to power erupted in many parts of France on June 2nd. In Dinan, northern France, ten thousand workers went on a 24-hour strike, and in Montluçon, five thousand workers also held a 24-hour strike. At four coal mines near Douai in the Nord region, more than three thousand miners also struck for 24 hours and passed a resolution expressing their determination to fight for a government that defends the Republic. Protest strikes also broke out in many factories in Paris, Marseille, the industrial area of ​​northeastern France, and the Ardennes and Meurthe-et-Moselle regions.

The French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement emphasizing that the French working class will continue to struggle in order to safeguard the rights of the people, trade union freedom, and all rights obtained through long and arduous struggles under all circumstances.

The General Confederation of Labor called on all trade union organizations and their members to establish closer contacts with democratic parties and organizations, strengthen the various committees for safeguarding the Republic, and establish new committees.

The General Confederation of Labor stated that it will continue to take action to safeguard the economic and social demands of the working class.

The French Anti-Fascist Resistance Committee also issued a communiqué on June 2nd, calling on all anti-fascist committees in various regions to remain vigilant against the fascist danger and to fight back against all acts that undermine freedom. The committee decided to organize a widespread educational movement to explain to the masses the dangers to democratic freedom posed by the National Assembly's vote on June 1st.

Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: Paris dispatch: Under the coercion of De Gaulle and the right-wing forces, the French National Assembly was forced to pass two bills in quick succession on June 2nd, which will have a major impact on the future of French politics: a bill granting De Gaulle six months of legislative and administrative "full powers" and a bill to immediately "revise" the constitution, which is the foundation of the French Republic. Left-wing republicans, led by communist members of the National Assembly, resolutely opposed this step leading to dictatorial rule.

Prior to this, the National Assembly passed the bill on granting De Gaulle six months of "full powers" by 322 votes to 232 votes, fifteen votes fewer than the majority De Gaulle obtained in the authorization vote. Forced by the opposition of left-wing forces within the National Assembly, De Gaulle and his supporters had to add certain restrictive clauses to the final bill passed. Minister of State Pflimlin was forced to assure the parliament that the government did not intend to establish extraordinary jurisdictions or modify "the basic principles concerning social welfare"; nor did the government intend to extend its broad powers to the abolition of treaties and the declaration of a state of emergency. However, Communist Assembly member Barange said that Pflimlin's guarantees did not eliminate the unease of many members.

On the same day, the National Assembly also hastily passed a bill extending the government's emergency powers in Algeria.

　　法国工人罢工抗议戴高乐上台
    国民议会在戴高乐挟持下通过三项反动法案
    据新华社巴黎3日电  法国许多地方在2日爆发了工人抗议戴高乐上台的罢工。在法国北部的迪南有一万工人，在蒙律松有五千工人，都举行了二十四小时罢工。在诺尔省的杜埃附近的四个煤矿，三千多矿工也罢工二十四小时，并且通过决议表示决心为争取一个保卫共和的政府而斗争。在巴黎、马赛、法国东北部工业区以及阿登省和穆尔特—摩塞尔省，许多工厂里也都爆发了抗议性罢工。
    法国总工会发表声明强调指出，法国工人阶级将继续进行斗争，以便在一切情况下维护人民权利、工会自由以及在长期艰苦斗争中取得的一切权利。
    总工会呼吁一切工会组织及其成员同民主的党派和组织建立更加密切的接触，加强维护共和的各个委员会并建立新的委员会。
    总工会说，它将继续不断地采取行动来维护工人阶级经济和社会的要求。
    法国反法西斯抵抗委员会2日也发表公报，号召在各地所有反法西斯委员会继续警惕法西斯危险，并且对一切损害自由的行为予以反击。委员会决定组织一个广泛的教育运动，向群众说明国民议会6月1日的投票结果对民主自由所造成的危险。
    据新华社3日讯  巴黎消息：在戴高乐和右翼势力的挟持下，法国国民议会被迫在2日一天内接连通过了两项对今后法国政治前途具有重大影响的法案：授予戴高乐六个月的立法和行政“全权”和立即“修改”作为法国共和政体基础的宪法的法案。国民议会中以共产党议员为首的左翼共和人士坚决反对这种导致独裁统治的步骤。
    在这以前，国民议会以三百二十二票对二百三十二票，比戴高乐在授权投票中取得的多数少十五票，通过了关于授予戴高乐六个月“全权”的法案。迫于国民议会内左翼力量的反对，戴高乐及其支持者不得不在最后通过的法案中加上某些限制性条款。国务部长弗林姆兰被迫向议会保证说，政府不打算建立非常的裁判权或是修改“有关社会福利的基本原则”；政府也不打算把它的广泛权力扩及废除条约和宣布紧急状态等方面。但是共产党议员巴朗歇发言说，弗林姆兰的保证并不能消除许多议员的不安。
    同一天，国民议会还匆匆通过了延长政府在阿尔及利亚的紧急权力的法案。
