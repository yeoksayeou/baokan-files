    New Creations in豫 Opera “Liu Hulan”
    Tan Gong
    After watching the豫 Opera “Liu Hulan,” I was continuously moved. Through the collective creation of all the actors, the orchestra, and the director, this play prominently displays the following three characteristics: tragic and magnificent, intense, and highly active. The entire performance is filled with revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, which is highlighted and consistently maintained throughout. The Third Troupe of the Henan豫 Opera Institute has been bold in its experimentation and shows a spirit of originality.
    This is the profound ideological aspect of the豫 Opera “Liu Hulan.” It seems that the director was clear on this point; having grasped this, the director aimed to achieve this goal through performance and music—that is, artistically. In my opinion, the form serves the content, rather than diminishing the content to fit the form, thus presenting the play's unrestrained and bold artistic style. The music utilizes the sonorous characteristics of Henan Bangzi, coupled with the bold use of percussion instruments, further enhancing the play's ideological atmosphere of revolutionary irresistibility and heroic struggle. I think this is highly commendable. It seems that the comrades of the Third Troupe are on the verge of a leap forward in art, breaking free from the constraints of artistic convention.
    “Liu Hulan” has become a widely praised subject in recent years in operas, dramas, and storytelling, not only because the heroic deeds of Martyr Liu Hulan have profound and typical significance but also because artists have gradually enriched the artistic image of "Liu Hulan" from various aspects in various creations.
    Here, a question is posed to us: art is a generalization of life, and the relationship between the truth of art and the truth of life. "Liu Hulan" is based on real people and events, but artists should be allowed to extract possible realities from the more generalized real life of this revolutionary era and place them in the artistic work of "Liu Hulan." Of course, this must be perfectly coordinated. I think in this regard, the豫 Opera "Liu Hulan" is richer. If you ask, was Liu Hulan really like that back then? I would say that in fact, she was not entirely like that, but based on her thoughts and actions, it was entirely possible for her to say and do that. Were the people around her really all like that? Not necessarily, but entirely possible, such as Xiuying in the play, who is entirely fictional by the author. But no one who has seen the play has doubted the authenticity of this character, because "Liu Hulan" reflects an era of revolutionary struggle, and in the fierce national and class struggles, such wavering and betraying revolutionary figures existed. Liu Hulan's struggle with traitors is also realistic and possible.
    Some of our artists have a vulgar understanding of revolutionary realism. They believe that copying according to facts is called realism, which is a distortion that hinders the enrichment and improvement of creation. If artistic works are created in this way, they will inevitably lack authenticity. The authenticity of an artwork is a generalization of real life; the more profoundly it generalizes, the more it can express the truth of life. The authenticity of art comes from the truth of life, but it is more typical than life; it is a combination of the reality and ideals of life. Artistic authenticity is about exposing the struggles and conflicts in life, starting from reality, but being higher than reality, which is the authenticity of art.
    The豫 Opera has broken through that vulgar understanding of realism in its performance, and I hope they can create even more inspiring realities in these areas.
    The members of the Third Troupe of the豫 Opera Institute are all comrades from cultural and art troupes who have achieved great success in learning from tradition, and I hope they will make further progress.

    豫剧“刘胡兰”有新创造
    檀弓
    我看了豫剧“刘胡兰”演出，一直是心情激动着的。这个戏在全体演员、乐队、导演的集体创造下，突出的表现了如下三个方面的特点，即悲壮，强烈，动作性大。全剧演出中始终洋溢着革命的英雄主义和革命必胜的乐观主义，这一点表现得很突出，贯串得也很结实。河南豫剧院三团敢于大胆尝试，有独创精神。
    这是豫剧“刘胡兰”思想性的深刻之处，看起来导演在这一点上是明确的；导演把握了这一点，就从表演方面，音乐方面，也就是说从艺术方面要求达到这一目的，依我看来是做到了形式服从了内容，而不是削内容以就形式，因而表现出全剧在艺术风格上的奔放，粗犷。音乐上运用了河南梆子的高亢特色，加上大胆运用打击乐器，更增强了全剧思想方面的革命的不可抗拒和英勇斗争的气氛。我觉得这一点颇值得赞扬。看起来三团同志们在艺术上有跃进之势，有摆脱艺术的陈规束缚之势。
    “刘胡兰”在近年的歌剧、话剧以及说唱中，已经成为一种广泛歌颂的题材，这除刘胡兰烈士本人的伟大事迹已经具有深刻的典型意义之外，还可看到艺术家们在各种创作中逐渐从各方面来丰富“刘胡兰”的艺术形象。
    这里，向我们提出一个问题，艺术是生活的概括，艺术的真实与生活的真实的相互关系。“刘胡兰”是真人真事，但又要允许艺术家从这个革命时代的更概括的现实生活中提炼出可能的现实，放到“刘胡兰”的艺术作品里。当然，这要完全协调。我觉得在这个方面，豫剧“刘胡兰”是更丰富了。你如果问刘胡兰当年真的那样吗？我说事实上她并不都是那样，但从她的思想行动上说，她完全可能那样说，那样做。他周围的人们真的都是那样吗？不一定，但完全可能，如剧中的秀英，事实上并没有这个人，是完全由作者虚构的。但谁看过戏后也没有怀疑过这个人物的不真实，因为“刘胡兰”是反映一个革命斗争的时代，在激烈的民族斗争和阶级斗争中，这种动摇叛变革命的人物是有的。刘胡兰与叛徒斗争也是现实的、可能的。
    我们有些艺术家们对于革命的现实主义理解得庸俗了。他们认为按照事实的模写，就叫做现实主义，这是一种歪曲，是束缚创作上的丰富和提高，如果说按照这种方法创造艺术作品，必然缺乏真实性。艺术作品的真实性，是现实生活的概括，越概括得深刻，越能表现出生活的真实性。艺术的真实性是来自生活的真实，但它比起生活来更典型，它是生活的现实与理想的结合。艺术上的真实性是要揭发出生活中的斗争和冲突，从现实出发，但比起现实来要更高一些，这才是艺术的真实性。
    豫剧在演出上是突破了那种庸俗的对现实主义的理解，希望他们能够在这些方面创造出更为鼓舞人心的现实来。
    豫剧院三团的团员们都是些文工团出身的同志，在学习传统方面获得很大的成就，希望他们百尺竿头再进一步。
