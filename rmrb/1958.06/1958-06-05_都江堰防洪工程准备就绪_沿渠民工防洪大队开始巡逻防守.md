Chengdu, June 4th (by our reporter) As the flood season approaches, the flood control project in the famous Dujiangyan irrigation area is ready. The main flood discharge channels of the inner and outer water systems—the Qingbai River and the key flood control sections along the Minjiang River—have prepared bamboo cages, pebbles, bamboo mats, and other materials for protecting the embankments. In some areas where a large amount of bamboo is needed in emergencies, local management and maintenance units and nearby agricultural cooperatives have signed contracts for supplying bamboo materials, ready for felling and use if necessary.

Currently, from the Dujiangyan Management Office of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Water Resources down to every township in the irrigation area, specialized organizations have been established to be responsible for directing flood control work. Along the main canals, people's militia flood prevention brigades have been organized by township, dividing the militia into patrol, inspection, defense, and communication teams. They have been taking up their flood control posts since June 1st. In order to fully prepare for flood control work and ensure the smooth progress of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production in the western Sichuan Plain, relevant departments will soon launch a comprehensive inspection of the organization of manpower and the preparation of materials for flood control throughout the region.

The Dujiangyan irrigation system uses the Minjiang River as its water source, and the upstream floods are large every summer. Before liberation, due to disordered canals and extremely poor maintenance, floods occurred every year, destroying farmland. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, annual repairs and maintenance projects have been greatly improved, thus greatly reducing the area of ​​farmland affected by disasters. Taking 1951, when the flood was relatively large, as an example, although the flood level was the same as in 1949 before liberation, the affected farmland was only one forty-sixth of the 140,000 mu affected in 1949.

### 都江堰防洪工程准备就绪  沿渠民工防洪大队开始巡逻防守

　　都江堰防洪工程准备就绪
    沿渠民工防洪大队开始巡逻防守
    本报成都4日电　洪水期来临，著名的都江堰灌区的防洪工程已准备就绪。内、外两个水系的主要排洪干道——青白江和岷江沿岸的重点防洪工段，已准备好防护堤岸用的竹笼、卵石、篾席等；有些紧急时使用竹料较多的地区，当地管理养护单位和附近农业社，订出供应竹料的合同，以备必要时砍伐使用。
    目前，从四川省水利厅都江堰管理处以下，直到灌区的每个乡，都建立了专门机构，负责指挥防洪工作。各主要干渠沿岸都以乡为单位组织了民工防洪大队，分工在巡逻、检查、防守、通信等四个方面的民工，从6月1日开始走上防洪岗位。为了充分作好防洪工作，以确保今年川西平原农业生产大跃进的顺利进行，有关部门即将在全区展开防洪的人力组织和物资准备工作的大检查。
    都江堰系以岷江江水作为水源，每年夏季上游洪水较大。解放前，由于渠道紊乱，养护工程极差，因而年年洪水成灾，冲坏农田。解放后，在党和政府的领导下，岁修和养护工程都有了很大改善，因而受灾农田面积大为减少。以洪水较大的1951年为例，虽然洪水位与解放前1949年相同，但受灾农田仅为1949年受灾面积十四万亩的四十六分之一。
