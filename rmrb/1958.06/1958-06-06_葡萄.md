　　Grapes
　　Grapes are one of the most widely cultivated and abundantly produced fruits in the world. Their production almost equals the combined production of apples, citrus fruits, and pears.
　　Grapes can be broadly divided into two types based on their use: one type is for fresh consumption, and the other is for winemaking. From the perspective of cultivation purposes in various countries, most grapes are used for winemaking. This is because the sugar and acid content in grapes is like a proportion specifically designed for winemaking.
　　There are many types of grapes. There are twenty-seven types of disease-resistant grapes alone, ten of which are in Asia, and six of which are in China. As for varieties, they are too numerous to count.
　　Plants of the grape genus are distributed in both the north and south of China. The wild grapes produced in the mountainous areas of Northeast China are one of the more widely distributed types. Local people often pick them for fresh consumption or send them to wineries for winemaking. The Tonghua and Changbai Mountain wines currently sold in the market are made from wild grapes. As for economically cultivated grape varieties, they were introduced from Central Asia during the Han Dynasty when Zhang Qian was sent as an envoy to the Western Regions. This is clearly recorded in the "Historical Records."
　　Although grapes have been cultivated in China for a long time, grape production has not been valued in the past, and prices have fluctuated unpredictably. Sales were not guaranteed, and the investment in cultivation was relatively large. Moreover, the products were not resistant to transportation and storage, which severely restricted the development of grape production. After liberation, with the strong support of the state, grape production has been restored and developed. In 1957, the cultivated area of grapes increased by more than double compared to 1952. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has the largest grape cultivation area in the country, accounting for about half of the country's total area and 70% of the output. Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan follow. The climatic conditions in North and Northwest China are particularly suitable for grape growth, and they have a good cultivation foundation, which will make them the main grape-producing areas in China. South of the Yellow River, and north of the Dabie Mountains and the Huai River, there are vast sandy wastelands that can be utilized. The lowest winter temperature generally does not exceed minus twelve degrees Celsius, so grape plants can overwinter in the open ground. Grapes have great development prospects in these areas as well.
　　Most of the grape varieties in China are for fresh consumption. The Turpan Basin in Xinjiang mainly produces seedless white grapes (for drying), while the southern Xinjiang region mainly produces red grapes. North and Northeast China mainly produce Longan, Milk, and Rose Fragrant grapes. In addition, there are more than twenty fresh consumption varieties in various parts of China, such as Black Chicken Heart. There are not many grape varieties specifically for winemaking in China at present. Although many have been introduced from abroad in recent years, they are still in the trial planting stage.
　　The areas where grapes are cultivated are generally divided into areas near cities and industrial and mining areas, and hilly areas. The experience of Chinese working farmers in cultivating grapes in barren mountainous areas is very valuable. Farmers in Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, have planted large areas of grapes on dry mountain slopes with 70% gravel content and only 0.3% organic matter content. The general yield reaches 1,000 jin per mu, and the high yield can reach 2,000 jin. Pingdu County, Shandong Province, has adopted various methods to support grape vines using stone mountain slopes, cliffs, and ditches. Some even build weirs on barren stone slopes and use human or animal power to transport soil from the mountains to fill in terraced fields for planting grapes. Under such harsh soil conditions, the general yield can be 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu, and the highest yield can be 3,700 jin. Many people who have visited grape cultivation in Qingxu or Pingdu have said: If grapes can be cultivated in such places, then there is no area in the country where grapes cannot be cultivated.
　　Grape propagation generally does not involve raising seedlings in nurseries. Instead, strong grape branches from the current year are pruned in late autumn or early spring and directly inserted into newly opened garden land. Grape training methods can be divided into two main categories: one is trellis training, and the other is cordon training. Milk, Longan, and other varieties with strong growth potential mostly use trellis training. Rose Fragrant, which has weaker growth potential, mostly uses cordon training. Generally speaking, cordon training is more convenient to manage, but the yield is not as high as that of trellises.

　　葡萄
    葡萄是世界上栽培很广，产量最多的一种水果。它几乎等于苹果、柑桔和梨的产量的总和。
    葡萄按用途来分，大体上可分为两种：一种是生食用的；一种是酿酒用的。从世界各国栽培目的来看，大部分葡萄是用来酿酒的。因为葡萄是最理想的酿酒原料，果实中所含的糖分和酸，就好像专门为酿酒而定下的比例一样。
    葡萄的种类很多。单是抗病的葡萄就有二十七种，在这二十七种当中，亚洲占了十种，中国占了六种。至于谈到品种，那就多到不可胜数了。
    葡萄一属的植物，在我国南北都有分布。东北山区所产的山葡萄就是分布较广的一种。当地群众多采来生食或送酒厂酿酒。现在市场销售的通化、长白山葡萄酒就是用山葡萄酿成的。作为经济栽培的葡萄品种，是在汉朝张骞出使西域的时候，从中亚细亚引入的。关于这一点，史记记载的很清楚。
    葡萄在我国栽培的历史虽然已经很久，但过去由于葡萄生产不被重视，价格波动无常，销路没有保证，加以栽培投资较大，产品又不耐运输贮藏等原因，严重地限制了葡萄生产的发展。解放以后，经过国家的大力扶持，葡萄生产已获得了恢复和发展。1957年葡萄的栽培面积比1952年增加一倍多。全国的葡萄栽培以新疆维吾尔自治区最多，面积约占全国的一半，产量占70％。山西、河北、山东、河南次之。我国华北、西北地区的气候条件，特别适宜葡萄的生长，并有较好的栽培基础，将是我国主要的葡萄产区。黄河以南，大别山、淮河以北的地区有着广阔的沙荒可以利用，冬季最低温度一般不超过摄氏零下十二度，葡萄植株可以露地越冬。葡萄在这些地区也有极大的发展前途。
    我国葡萄品种多为生食种。新疆地区的吐鲁番盆地，以无核白（制干品种）为主；南疆地区以红葡萄为主。华北、东北地区以龙眼、牛奶、玫瑰香为主。此外，我国各地还有黑鸡心等二十多个生食品种。专门作为酿酒用的葡萄品种，我国目前还不多，近几年虽然从国外引种不少，但还在试种阶段。
    栽培葡萄的地区，大体上分为城市、工矿区附近和丘陵地区。我国劳动农民创造的，在贫瘠的山区栽培葡萄的经验是十分可贵的。山西省清徐县的农民在含沙砾70％、有机质含量仅0.3％的山坡旱地上，栽种了大面积的葡萄，一般产量达到每亩一千斤，高产的能达二千斤。山东省平度县采取多种多样的方法，利用石山坡地崖、水沟等处，支架葡萄，有的甚至在终年光秃的石坡上垒堰，并用人力或畜力从山下运土填成梯田来栽种葡萄。就在这样恶劣的土壤条件下，一般每亩可产葡萄一千五百到二千斤，最高有产三千七百斤的。许多在清徐或平度参观过葡萄栽培的人都说：这样的地方都能栽培葡萄，全国各地就没有不能栽培葡萄的地区了。
    葡萄的繁殖，一般不经过苗圃育苗，多在秋末或早春剪取当年生的、充实的葡萄枝蔓，在新辟园地上直接扦插。葡萄的整形方法，可以分为两大类：一种是棚架整枝，另一种是篱垣式整枝。生长势较强的牛奶、龙眼等品种多采用棚架整枝。生长势较弱的玫瑰香多采用篱垣式整枝。一般说，篱垣式整枝管理较方便，但产量不如棚架高。
