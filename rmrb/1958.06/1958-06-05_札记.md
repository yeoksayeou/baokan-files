    Ruining the Country and the People
    A Manila dispatch reports that the Philippines' foreign trade deficit for the first quarter of this year reached $48.5 million, an increase of $24.5 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This figure indicates that the Philippines' financial and economic situation, characterized by the depletion of dollar reserves, continues to deteriorate. This is a huge irony for the so-called "belt-tightening" policy announced by Philippine President Garcia at Christmas in 1957.
    The so-called "belt-tightening" means making the people go hungry. However, this approach will only harm the people and will not improve the Philippines' extremely deteriorating economic situation. The fundamental reason for the Philippines' economic deterioration is primarily due to the ruling clique headed by Garcia implementing a policy of complete subservience to the United States. If Garcia continues to adhere to this policy, he will never realize his dream of improving the economic situation.
    Checked
    De Gaulle wrote to Tunisian President Bourguiba as soon as he came to power, expressing his hope to improve Franco-Tunisian relations. Bourguiba quickly replied, asking him to clearly explain how he intended to do so.
    This was something De Gaulle had not anticipated. It was precisely those extreme colonialists, on whom he relied to come to power, who were vehemently opposed to the withdrawal of French troops stationed in Tunisia and constantly carried out military provocations against Tunisia, which led to the increasingly deterioration of relations between the two countries. However, in order to use the resolution of the North African issue as political capital to deceive the French people, he had to express some "friendly wishes" to Tunisia. Of course, while posturing, he could not propose any concrete solutions. Now, Bourguiba is unequivocal, demanding that he produce the real thing. This move has him checked.

    札记
    祸国殃民
    据马尼拉消息，菲律宾今年第一季度的对外贸易入超达四千八百五十万美元，比去年第一季度增加了二千四百五十万美元。这项数字表明，以美元储备枯竭为特征的菲律宾财政经济状况在继续恶化中。这对于1957年底菲律宾总统加西亚在圣诞节宣布的所谓“勒紧裤带”政策是一个绝大的讽刺。
    所谓“勒紧裤带”，就是要老百姓饿肚子。但是，这种做法只会害了老百姓，而不可能改善菲律宾的极端恶化的经济情况。菲律宾经济恶化的根本原因，首先是由于以加西亚为首的统治集团执行完全屈从美国的政策。如果加西亚还坚持这种政策，那他就永远做不成改善经济状况的美梦。
    将住了
    戴高乐一上台就给突尼斯总统布尔吉巴写信，表示希望改善法突关系。布尔吉巴也很快回了信，要求他清楚说明准备怎样做。
    这一下，是戴高乐事先所没有想到的。因为，正是他上台时所依靠的那些极端殖民主义者竭力反对撤出法国驻在突尼斯的军队，并且不断对突尼斯进行军事挑衅，才使得两国关系越来越恶化。但是，为了拿解决北非问题作为欺骗法国人民的政治资本，他又不得不对突尼斯表示一些“友好的愿望”。当然，他在故作姿态的时候，是不可能提出什么具体办法的。现在，布尔吉巴却毫不含糊，要他拿出真货色来。这一军就把他将住了。
