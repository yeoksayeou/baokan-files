    Mao Dun Visits Northeast Encouraging Amateur Literary Workers
    Let Literary Work Shine
    A Group of Worker-Peasant Amateur Authors Become Members of the Wuhan Branch of the Writers Association
    (Our Paper News) China Writers Association Chairman Mao Dun recently visited Shenyang and Harbin.
    During his time in Shenyang and Harbin, Mao Dun widely contacted amateur literary creators and cultural and artistic workers, and held discussions with them on literary creation issues. At a meeting of over one hundred worker-peasant amateur authors in Heilongjiang Province, Mao Dun analyzed excellent works by worker-peasant amateur authors such as "A Bag of Sunflower Seeds" and "A Big Character Poster Just Started," which greatly inspired and encouraged those present. When Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory held a second-anniversary celebration for the establishment of its amateur creation group, Mao Dun also attended the meeting and visited the comrades of the Han Tongliang creation group. Mao Dun also encouraged this group to write more clapper rhymes and cross-talk. He inscribed the words "Sprout, Sprout, bloomed last year, bears fruit this year" for the factory's literary tabloid "Sprout."
    During the visit, Mao Dun encouraged young authors to strengthen their political and ideological cultivation, study hard, immerse themselves in life, establish a correct creative attitude, and write more works reflecting the current reality of struggle and the socialist Great Leap Forward. Mao Dun believed that the reason why some works by amateur literary authors are good, have a fresh and lively style, and possess the spirit of sweeping mountains and rivers, able to express this great era, is mainly because they have been tempered in actual struggle. At a report meeting for nearly two thousand amateur literary creators and cultural and artistic workers in Shenyang, Mao Dun also recited a folk song: "There is no Jade Emperor in the sky, no Dragon King on the earth, I am the Jade Emperor, I am the Dragon King, ordering the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to open the way, I am coming." He praised this folk song for its rich imagination and for being a work that combines politics and artistry well. In his report, Mao Dun repeatedly encouraged amateur authors to break with superstitious ideas, fully tap their potential, create diverse forms, write about things they are most familiar with in life, let a hundred flowers bloom in the literary world, and let literary work shine with socialist brilliance.
    During his activities in Harbin, Mao Dun paid close attention to reading local literary publications and personally revised manuscripts from the masses.
    Accompanying Mao Dun on his visit to the Northeast were Guo Xiaochuan, Secretary-General of the China Writers Association, and others.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 23rd - The Wuhan branch of the China Writers Association recently admitted eight worker-peasant amateur authors as members.
    Most of these worker-peasant amateur authors are workers and peasants who had little or no schooling in the past. Under the Party's cultivation and education, they have shown great literary talent. Zhang Qinghe, a farmer-poet from Xishui County, is a young farmer who only attended school for two years in the past. In recent years, he has not only improved his cultural level and written many lyrics, poems, and plays closely related to production and political movements, which have been widely circulated in rural Hubei, but he has also never left productive labor and is a production activist in the agricultural cooperative. Since the Great Leap Forward, he has successively written beautiful poems such as "Green Water Laughs Over the Mountain Slope" and "Mistaking the Reservoir for the Dragon Palace," which have been published in many newspapers and periodicals. Xiong Weixi, a porter, is also a more familiar amateur author among Wuhan's worker literature and art enthusiasts. In his spare time from productive labor, he has written many clapper rhyme plays, drum lyrics, operas, etc., related to industrial production. His local operas such as "The True Story of Liu Ergu" and "Xiao Ji and Xiao Feng" encourage people to fight against bourgeois ideology and are very popular among the masses.
    In recent years, the Wuhan branch of the China Writers Association and the editorial departments of relevant publications have sent cadres to strengthen the guidance and assistance to these worker-peasant amateur authors, often revising and discussing works with them. Party organizations in various places have also helped them establish amateur creation groups, supporting and helping them to carry out creation activities and strengthen their studies.

    茅盾参观访问东北各地鼓励业余文艺工作者
    让文艺工作发出异彩
    一批工农业余作者成为作协武汉分会会员
    本报讯  中国作家协会主席茅盾，最近到沈阳、哈尔滨参观访问。
    茅盾在沈阳、哈尔滨期间，广泛地接触了业余文学创作者和文化艺术工作者，同他们座谈有关文艺创作问题。在黑龙江省一百多名工农业余作者会议上，茅盾当场分析了“一袋葵花籽”、“一张才开头的大字报”等优秀的工农业余作者的作品，到会的人得到了很大启发和鼓励。哈尔滨第一工具厂举行业余创作组成立两周年纪念会时，茅盾也参加了这个会，并且访问了韩统良创作组的同志。茅盾还鼓励这个小组多写快板、相声。他给这个工厂的文艺小报“萌芽”题了字：“萌芽萌芽，去年开花，今年结果”。
    在参观访问过程中，茅盾勉励青年作者加强政治思想修养，努力学习，深入生活，树立正确的创作态度，多写反映当前现实斗争和社会主义大跃进的作品。茅盾认为业余文学作者有些作品所以好，所以有新鲜活泼的风格，有气吞山河的气魄，能够表现这个伟大的时代，主要在于他们是从实际斗争中锻炼出来的。茅盾在沈阳近两千名业余文学创作者和文化艺术工作者报告会上，还朗诵了一首民歌：“天上没有玉皇，地上没有龙王，我就是玉皇，我就是龙王，喝令三山五岭开道，我来了。”并称赞这首民歌有丰富的想像力，是政治性和艺术性结合得较好的作品。茅盾在报告中一再鼓励业余作者打破迷信思想，充分发挥潜力，创造多种形式，写生活中最熟悉的东西，让文坛百花齐放，文艺工作发出社会主义的异彩。
    茅盾在哈尔滨活动期间，很注意阅读当地文艺刊物，还亲自修改过群众稿件。
    陪同茅盾在东北参观访问的有中国作家协会秘书长郭小川等。

    新华社武汉23日电  中国作家协会武汉分会最近吸收了八个工农业余作者为会员。
    这些工农业余作者大部分是过去很少或没有念过书的工人和农民，他们在党的培养和教育下，表现了很高的文艺才能。浠水县的农民诗人张庆和是一个过去只念过二年书的青年农民。几年来，他不仅提高了文化水平，写出了许多紧密结合生产、结合政治运动的唱词、诗歌和剧本，在湖北农村广泛地流传着，而且一直没有脱离过生产劳动，是农业社的生产积极分子。大跃进以来，他先后写出了“绿水笑着过山坡”、“错把水库当龙宫”等优美的诗篇，被许多报刊登载。搬运工人熊维喜也是武汉工人文艺爱好者比较熟悉的一个业余作者。他在生产劳动之余，写了许多结合工业生产的快板剧、鼓词、歌剧等，他写的“柳二姑现形记”、“小继和小凤”等地方歌剧，鼓舞着人们向资产阶级思想作斗争，很受群众欢迎。
    中国作家协会武汉分会和有关刊物编辑部，几年来派干部加强了对这些工农业余作者的辅导和帮助，经常和他们一起修改和讨论作品。各地党组织也帮助他们建立业余创作小组，支持和帮助他们进行创作活动和加强学习。
