    Red Flag Brand Motorcycle

    After eighteen days of hard work, the staff of the Sujiatun Automobile Repair Factory in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, successfully trial-produced eight new products: a motorcycle, a universal tractor, an electric motor, a four-wheeled trailer, a new-style horse-drawn flatbed cart, a starting compensator, a grass cutter, and a 10-inch water pump. All of these new products are named "Red Flag Brand."

    The "Red Flag No. 3" motorcycle has undergone driving tests and is of good quality, with a speed of over 100 kilometers per hour. Fuel consumption is very low.
