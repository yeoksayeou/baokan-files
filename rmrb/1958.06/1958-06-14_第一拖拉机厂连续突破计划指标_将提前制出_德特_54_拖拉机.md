    The First Tractor Factory Continuously Breaks Planned Targets
    Will Produce "Dongfanghong-54" Tractor Ahead of Schedule

    (Our newspaper, June 13th) (Our reporter Zhang Jianhong reports:) After the victorious conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the workers of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant expressed their determination to respond to the great call of the congress with practical actions, accelerating the manufacturing of "Dongfanghong-54" tractors as a gift for this year's National Day.

    This year is the year with the largest workload for the tractor factory, entering the stage of construction, adjustment of production, and trial manufacturing simultaneously; at the same time, it also undertakes the temporary task of manufacturing 1,200 small tractors. From January to the first half of May, the workers of this factory, in the rectification movement, continuously broke planned targets. In April, the tool workshop produced 1,446 kinds of workpieces for tractors, almost equal to the total number of workpieces produced in January and February. Of the 8,000 kinds of gauges and cutting tools required for assembling the "Dongfanghong-54" tractor, 6,000 kinds have now been completed. In addition, the workers of the whole factory have created more than a dozen new types of fixtures, which played a decisive role in producing tractors ahead of schedule and improving product quality.

    Now, according to the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the workers are demanding that they further implement the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and further realize technological innovation on the basis of their achieved successes.

    ("Dongfanghong-54" tractor is a diesel-burning, crawler-type agricultural general-purpose tractor with an engine power of 54 horsepower. This tractor can both pull plows and sow seeds.)

    第一拖拉机厂连续突破计划指标
    将提前制出“德特54”拖拉机
    本报13日电  本报记者张健虹报道：第一拖拉机制造厂的职工在中共“八大”第二次会议胜利闭幕后，表示要以实际行动响应会议的伟大号召，加速制造出“德特54”拖拉机来，作为今年国庆节的献礼。
    今年是拖拉机厂进入边建设，边调整生产，边试制的工作量最大的一年；同时还额外地承担了一千二百台小型拖拉机制造的临时任务。1月至5月上半月，这个厂的职工，在整风运动中，连续突破计划指标。工具车间，4月里制出了拖拉机上用的一千四百四十六种工件，几乎等于1、2两月生产工件的总和。装配“德特54”拖拉机需用的八千种量具刃具，现在已完成六千种。此外全厂职工还创制了十几种新的工卡夹具，对于提前出拖拉机，提高产品质量起了决定性的作用。
    现在职工们又根据“八大”二次会议精神，要求自己在既得成绩的基础上，进一步贯彻多快好省，进一步实现技术革新。
    （“德特54”拖拉机是一种烧柴油的、履带式农业通用拖拉机，它的发动机的功率为五十四马力。这种拖拉机既可以拉犁，又可以播种。）
