    Finishing Forty Years of Work in One Day

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Motor Factory workers Zhu Xiangjie and Li Xuecheng used chemical methods to replace manual scraping of enameled wire ends, increasing work efficiency more than 14,000 times. Now, one day of work is equivalent to more than forty years in the past.

    In the winding workshop of the Tianjin Electric Motor Factory, when welding various insulated coils, workers had to manually scrape off the enamel coating on the enameled wire ends. One person could scrape only 800 wire ends in three hours. Li Xuecheng, a graduate of a secondary technical school, and Zhu Xiangjie, an apprentice who had recently joined the factory, recently used nitric acid and potassium aluminum acid to immerse the enameled wire ends, allowing the enamel coating to fall off automatically. The factory's entire year's workload of scraping wire ends can now be completed by one person in thirty-seven minutes.

    一天干完四十多年的活
    据新华社天津电　中天电机厂工人祝相杰、李学成用化学方法代替人工刮漆包线线头，提高工作效率一万四千多倍，现在工作一天，等于过去四十多年。
    中天电机厂绕线工段在焊接各种绝缘线圈时，要用手工将漆包线上的漆皮刮掉，一人干三小时才能刮八百根线头。中等技术学校毕业的学生李学成和进厂不久的徒工祝相杰，最近用硝酸和氢酸钾铝来浸蚀漆包线头，漆皮能自行脱落，全厂刮线头的全年工作量，一个人用三十七分钟就完成了。
