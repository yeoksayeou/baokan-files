    The China Welfare Association is celebrating its 20th anniversary, and I am very happy to congratulate it on this occasion. Over the past 20 years, the China Welfare Association has actively participated in the Chinese people's liberation movement and made outstanding contributions.
    The China Welfare Association was established in 1938, and its original name was the China Defense League. At that time, the vast land of China was suffering from the ravages of Japanese imperialism. Wherever their iron hooves went, they burned, killed, looted, and did everything possible, leaving the people displaced and desolate. The Chinese people rose up to resist the Japanese imperialist invasion. The Chinese Communist Party and its armed forces—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army—quickly launched guerrilla warfare with the people behind enemy lines and established anti-Japanese revolutionary base areas. It was during this period that the China Defense League was born. Its name aptly reflected the task of fighting against reactionaries at home and abroad at that time.
    The China Defense League provided tremendous material and moral support to the revolutionary base areas and anti-Japanese guerrillas of the Chinese people, and encountered many difficulties. During the Hong Kong period, although Hong Kong's geographical location and transportation conditions were very conducive to appealing to overseas, contacting overseas, and raising relief supplies, it was very difficult to send these things to the revolutionary base areas in urgent need. This problem was particularly serious after 1940, when the Kuomintang launched several anti-communist upsurges and blockaded the border areas, and Japanese imperialism cut off China's transportation to Vietnam. However, the China Defense League still tried everything possible to transport supplies to the border areas and guerrilla areas.
    In 1941, Hong Kong was occupied by Japan, and the work of the China Defense League became even more difficult. It was impossible to continue activities in Hong Kong, and donations from abroad could not come in. It was forced to withdraw to Chongqing. At this time, some international relief organizations were controlled by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the activities of the China Defense League were greatly hindered. Even in this harsh environment, the China Defense League still carried out activities in various aspects and used all available transportation conditions, such as cars and planes traveling between Yan'an and Chongqing at that time, to transport supplies to the Liberated Areas.
    When the Chinese Liberated Areas were subjected to the mopping-up operations of the Japanese army and the blockade of the Kuomintang, the assistance of the China Defense League was of particular importance to the struggle of the people in the Liberated Areas against the mopping-up operations and the blockade.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, in order to meet the new situation, the China Defense League was renamed the China Welfare Fund and launched activities in Shanghai. At this time, the Liberated Areas led by the Chinese Communist Party established the China Liberated Areas Relief Association in order to heal the wounds suffered by the Chinese people in the war. On the one hand, they organized the people in the Liberated Areas to carry out self-help and mutual assistance, and on the other hand, they contacted relief and welfare organizations outside the Liberated Areas, first of all the China Welfare Fund, to accept international assistance. The China Liberated Areas Relief Association received the kind concern and strong support of the China Welfare Fund.
    After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese people longed for a peaceful life from then on, but American imperialism supported its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in China and launched an anti-people civil war. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade of the border areas made the medical and health work in the border areas very difficult and distressed, as Chairman Soong Ching Ling said in an article: "The army that most severely attacked the Japanese fascists' positions in China encountered a more severe and cruel 'non-interference' policy. Domestic political blockades left them without doctors, surgical instruments, and medicines; even those sent by foreign friends could not reach them." After the Japanese surrender, when this blockade turned into a full-scale offensive, it is not difficult to imagine that the task of rescuing the wounded and treating the sick facing the China Liberated Areas Relief Association and the China Welfare Fund was even more difficult and serious!
    However, due to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the expansion of the Chinese Liberated Areas, and the increasing demands of the people for medical and health and childcare work, the undertakings funded by the China Welfare Fund in the Chinese Liberated Areas have developed rapidly.
    By 1948, there were eight International Peace Hospitals and forty-two International Peace Hospital branches in the eight Liberated Areas, with a total of 11,800 beds. In addition, there were dozens of mobile medical teams serving the military and civilians of the Chinese Liberated Areas with a population of 140 million at that time.
    The development of the International Peace Hospital symbolizes the friendship and unity between the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. The activities of the International Peace Hospital have set an example for carrying out medical and health work in all economically underdeveloped countries and regions in Asia and Africa. The International Peace Hospital also demonstrates the revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, working hard and overcoming all difficulties with the help of international friends.
    With the formation of the International Peace Hospital network, six Bethune Medical Schools were established in the Chinese Liberated Areas one after another. In addition, the staff of the International Peace Hospital held many short-term training courses. Although these schools in the Liberated Areas were in an environment of continuous war, they often had to move from here to there, just like the International Peace Hospital and the childcare centers, but they still overcame all difficulties and insisted on teaching. By 1948, the Bethune Medical Schools in various places had trained a total of more than 2,000 medical workers, including doctors, nurses, dentists, laboratory technicians, and pharmacists. Many medical schools were not sound enough during the Anti-Japanese War, but after the end of the Anti-Japanese War and the liberation of larger cities, they were expanded into higher medical schools with relatively complete equipment.
    With the assistance of the China Welfare Fund, several pharmaceutical factories were established in the Chinese Liberated Areas, among which the earliest was the Northwest Pharmaceutical Factory, and the largest was the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Jiaodong, Shandong. At first, these pharmaceutical factories could only produce raw medicines, but later, thanks to the assistance of the China Welfare Fund and the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, material conditions were improved, and they could also manufacture chemically synthesized medicines. The China Welfare Fund also provided assistance to many farms in the Liberated Areas, such as the Guanghua Farm in Yan'an, the animal husbandry farm in Sanbian, the Laiyang Farm in Shandong, and the Xinji Farm in Hebei. In addition to sending agricultural technical experts to work on the farms, they also sent seeds, artificial insemination devices, insecticides, etc.
    The China Welfare Fund also actively assisted the children's cause in the Chinese Liberated Areas. The Northwest Border Area Nursery and the Los Angeles Nursery were the earliest to receive assistance from the China Welfare Fund. At first, they adopted war orphans and homeless children, and later developed into general childcare centers. There were a total of ten such childcare centers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, seven in Shandong, and many others in other places.
    According to incomplete statistics, from 1944 to 1947 alone, the China Welfare Fund donated 2.2 billion old currency to the Chinese Liberated Areas, excluding other medical supplies, books, etc. The Yan'an International Peace Hospital did not have X-ray equipment until 1944 with the help of the China Welfare Fund. When we often sacrificed several lives to buy a few small boxes of medicines through the blockade line, and when a small bottle of sulfonamide could save many lives, how precious were the tons of medical supplies sent in by the China Welfare Fund! The difficulty of medical conditions in the Liberated Areas at that time was best witnessed by Dr. Bethune, the excellent son of the Canadian people. On the front line in Shanxi in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, when people helped him prepare for amputation surgery and took out a saw for sawing wood to give him, he not only couldn't understand it, but was simply angry. Due to the brutal exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, China has been a poor and backward country for many years, and the backwardness and poverty of the Chinese countryside have reached an alarming level. There were no anesthetics, sulfonamides, surgical instruments, and sometimes not even the most basic medical conditions. Obviously, without the help of the China Welfare Fund, it would have been more difficult to carry out medical and health work in the Liberated Areas.
    The China Welfare Fund directly or indirectly introduced many foreign doctors, nurses, and other technical personnel to work in the Chinese Liberated Areas. For a period of time, several medical teams funded by the China Welfare Fund worked in several Liberated Areas at the same time.
    When I look back on the work of the China Welfare Fund, especially during the Anti-Japanese War, when the Liberated Areas led by the Chinese Communist Party were divided by Japanese imperialism externally and blockaded by the Kuomintang reactionaries internally, I cannot help but pay my respects to the China Welfare Fund and its leader, Chairman Soong Ching Ling, for their unremitting efforts to assist the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. The China Welfare Fund not only helped us solve the medical problems in the scattered rural areas, but more importantly, it promoted to the world that we were truly actively resisting Japan.
    The China Welfare Fund is different from all welfare organizations in old China in that it has a clear stand, that is, the political stand of the revolutionary people. It opposes the "neutral" view of relief, it never supports the "non-interference" policy, it advocates promoting the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of Dr. Bethune in helping China, and it proposes that relief is only anti-fascist relief, and relief is only relief for the struggle for democracy. This still has extremely important practical significance for every relief and welfare worker today.
    In 1946, I went to Shanghai as the representative of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association stationed in the Kuomintang area. In the two years after that, when I was striving for materials for the Liberated Areas from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Kuomintang Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, I repeatedly received the care and assistance of the China Welfare Fund and Chairman Soong Ching Ling. When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration handed over 98% of this material to the Chiang-controlled area and allocated less than 2% of the material to the Liberated Areas, the China Welfare Fund used airplanes and ships from Shanghai and Beijing to transport a large amount of material to the Liberated Areas, including many complete sets of hospital equipment. In order to facilitate the passage through the Kuomintang's blockade line, the China Welfare Fund sometimes entrusted some international friends to personally escort the materials. Following Dr. Bethune, another Canadian doctor, Harrison, died shortly after transporting the materials into the Liberated Areas due to the fatigue of the journey. In order to commemorate him, the International Peace Hospital in Handan was named "Harrison International Peace Hospital". The efforts made by the China Welfare Fund not only showed its love and support for the Chinese people, but also showed its protest against the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Kuomintang Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.
    In 1947, when the Liberation War was at a turning point, the China Welfare Fund entrusted some international friends to send 15 tons of medical supplies to the Liberated Areas. In 1949, it transferred 300 tons of materials that had not been shipped out of Shanghai due to the Liberation War to the China Liberated Areas Relief Association.
    In warmly celebrating the 20th anniversary of the China Welfare Association, I express my respect for its efforts and contributions to the cause of national liberation, safeguarding peace, and promoting the welfare of the people. I wish the China Welfare Association greater development and achievements in the great socialist construction of the motherland and in the welfare of women and children.

    中国福利基金会与中国解放区救济总会
    伍云甫
    中国福利会成立二十周年了，我以非常欣喜的心情来祝贺这个日子。二十年来，中国福利会积极地参加了中国人民的解放运动，并且有着卓越的贡献。
    中国福利会成立在1938年，它最初的名称是保卫中国同盟。当时，中国的广阔土地，正遭受着日本帝国主义的蹂躏，铁蹄所至，烧杀掳掠，无所不为，人民流离失所，一片凄凉。中国人民为了抵抗日本帝国主义的侵略，奋起抗战。中国共产党和它的武装力量——八路军、新四军，迅速地在敌后同人民一道开展了游击战争，并建立了抗日革命根据地。在这个时期，保卫中国同盟诞生了。它的名称恰当地反映了当时和国内外反动派进行斗争的任务。
    保卫中国同盟在物质上和道义上，对中国人民的革命根据地和抗日游击队，进行了巨大的支援，并且遇到过许多困难。在香港时期，虽然香港的地理位置和交通条件非常便利于向海外呼吁、与海外联系以及募集救济物资，但是把这些东西送到急需的革命根据地，是很困难的。这问题特别在1940年以后显得严重，那时，国民党几次掀起反共高潮并封锁边区，日本帝国主义又切断了中国与越南的交通。但是保卫中国同盟仍然想尽一切办法，给边区和游击区运送了物资。
    1941年香港被日本占领，保卫中国同盟的工作就更加困难了，不可能在香港继续活动，国外捐助的东西也来不了，它被迫撤到重庆。这时候，一些国际救济团体受到国民党反动派的统治把持，保卫中国同盟的活动受到了很大的阻挠。即使在这种恶劣的环境下，保卫中国同盟仍然在各方面活动，并利用一切可以利用的交通条件，如当时往来于延安、重庆之间的汽车和飞机，向解放区运送物资。
    在中国解放区受着日本军队扫荡又受着国民党封锁的时候，保卫中国同盟的援助，对解放区人民反扫荡和反封锁的斗争，具有特别重大的意义。
    1945年抗日战争胜利，为了迎接新形势，保卫中国同盟改名为中国福利基金会，在上海展开活动。在这时，中国共产党领导的解放区为了医治中国人民在战争中所受的创伤，成立了中国解放区救济总会。一方面组织解放区人民进行自救互助，一方面同解放区以外的救济福利团体，首先是与中国福利基金会取得联系，接受国际援助。中国解放区救济总会，受到中国福利基金会的亲切关怀和大力支持。
    在日本帝国主义投降后，中国人民渴望从此过和平的日子，但是美帝国主义扶植它在中国的走狗蒋介石，发动了反人民的内战。在抗日战争时期，国民党反动派对边区的封锁，使当时边区的医疗救护工作处在非常艰难困苦的环境中，正如宋庆龄主席在一篇文章中所说的：“最沉重地打击日本法西斯在中国的阵地的军队，却遇到一个更严厉、更残忍的‘不干涉’政策。国内政治的封锁使他们没有医生、外科器械和药品；甚至由国外友人送来的，他们也得不到。”在日本投降以后，当这种封锁一变而为全面进攻时，不难想像，摆在中国解放区救济总会和中国福利基金会面前的救死扶伤的任务，是更加艰难严重了！
    然而，由于抗日战争的胜利，中国解放区的扩大，人民对医药卫生和儿童保育工作的要求的不断增长，中国福利基金会在中国解放区所资助的事业单位，有了迅速的发展。
    到1948年，在八个解放区中，有了八个国际和平医院，四十二个国际和平医院分院，共有一万一千八百床位，此外还有好几十个巡回医疗队，为当时的一亿四千万人口的中国解放区军民服务。
    国际和平医院的发展，象征着中国人民和世界上一切爱好和平人士的友谊和团结；国际和平医院的活动，为亚非一切经济不发达的国家和地区，树立了在这些国家和地区进行医药卫生工作的典范。国际和平医院还显示了中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，和国际友人帮助下，艰苦奋斗、克服一切困难的革命英雄气概。
    随着国际和平医院网的组成，中国解放区先后成立了六个白求恩医科学校。此外国际和平医院的工作人员举办了许多短期训练班。解放区的这些学校虽然处在战争连年不停的环境中，经常同国际和平医院和儿童保育院一样，要从这里搬到那里，但是他们仍然克服一切困难，坚持了教学。到1948年，各地白求恩医科学校一共培养了二千多名医务工作者，其中包括医生、护士、牙医、化验员和药剂师。许多医科学校在抗日战争时期是不够健全的，但是在抗日战争结束、较大城市解放以后，都扩充成为设备比较完善的高等医科学校了。
    在中国福利基金会的资助下，中国解放区成立了好几个制药厂，其中最早成立的是西北制药厂，规模最大的是山东胶东的新华制药厂。这些制药厂起初只能制生药，后来由于中国福利基金会的援助和中国人民革命斗争的胜利，物质条件有了改善，也能制造化学合成药品了。中国福利基金会还对许多解放区的农场提供了援助，如对延安的光华农场、三边的畜牧场、山东莱阳农场、河北辛集农场等。除了派农业技术专家到农场工作，还送来种籽、人工授精器、杀虫剂等。
    中国福利基金会对中国解放区的儿童事业也进行了积极的援助。西北的边区保育院和洛杉矶托儿所是最早得到中国福利基金会的援助的。他们起初收养战灾孤儿，无家可归的儿童，后来便发展成一般托儿所了。像这样的托儿所，在陕甘宁边区一共有十个，在山东有七个，其他各地还有许多。
    根据不完全统计，仅1944年到1947年，中国福利基金会捐给中国解放区的捐款即达二十二亿旧币，不包括其他医药物资和书籍等。延安国际和平医院直到1944年经过中国福利基金会的帮助，才有了X光的设备。当我们通过封锁线买几小箱药物往往会牺牲几条生命的时候，当一小瓶磺胺药即可以救活许多生命的时候，中国福利基金会送进来的成吨的医药物资是多么宝贵啊！当时解放区医药条件的困难，加拿大人民的优秀儿子白求恩大夫是最好的见证人之一。在抗战初期的山西前线，当人们帮他准备作截肢手术拿出一把锯木头的锯子给他时，他不但不能理解，而且简直是愤怒了。由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的残酷剥削，多少年来中国就是又穷又白的国家，中国农村的落后和贫困达到惊人的程度。没有麻醉剂、磺胺、手术器械，有时甚至没有最起码的医药条件。显然地，没有中国福利基金会的帮助，开展解放区的医药卫生工作是会遇到更大的困难的。
    中国福利基金会直接或间接介绍了许多外国医生、护士和其他技术人员到中国解放区工作。在一个时期内，由中国福利基金会资助的几个医疗队，同时在几个解放区工作。
    当我回顾中国福利基金会的工作的时候，特别是抗日战争这一段时期，在中国共产党所领导的解放区，外受日本帝国主义的分割，内受国民党反动派封锁的情况下，我对中国福利基金会和它的领导人宋庆龄主席为援助解放区军民所作的不懈的努力，不禁肃然起敬。中国福利基金会不仅帮助我们解决了分散的农村中的医疗问题，而且更重要的，是向国内外宣传了我们是真正积极抗战的。
    中国福利基金会不同于一切旧中国的福利团体，这在于它有鲜明的立场，即革命的人民的政治立场。它反对“中立”的救济观点，它从不支持“不干涉”政策，它主张发扬白求恩大夫帮助中国的革命人道主义精神，它提出救济只是反法西斯的救济，救济只是争取民主的救济。这对今天每一个救济福利工作者，都仍然有着极其重要的现实意义。
    1946年，我作为中国解放区救济总会驻国民党区代表而去上海。在这以后的两年中，在我向联合国善后救济总署和国民党行政院善后救济总署为解放区争取物资时，又多次得到中国福利基金会和宋庆龄主席的照顾和协助。当联合国善后救济总署把这笔物资的98％交给蒋管区，只将不到2％的物资拨给解放区时，中国福利基金会却从上海、北京两地利用去解放区的飞机和船只，向解放区大量运送物资，其中包括许多全套的医院设备。为了便于通过国民党的封锁线，中国福利基金会有时还委托一些国际友人亲自押运物资。继白求恩大夫之后，又一位加拿大夏利逊大夫在刚把物资运入解放区，就因为旅途上的劳顿而去世了。为了纪念他，邯郸的国际和平医院被命名为“夏利逊国际和平医院”。中国福利基金会所进行的这些努力，不但表示了它对中国人民的热爱与支持，同时还表示了它对联合国善后救济总署和国民党行政院善后救济总署的抗议。
    在1947年，正当解放战争处于转折点的阶段，中国福利基金会委托一些国际友人为解放区送来十五吨医药物资。1949年，又将由于解放战争未能运出上海的三百吨物资，拨交中国解放区救济总会。
    在热烈庆祝中国福利会成立二十周年的时候，我对它在争取民族解放、保卫和平与增进人民福利的事业上所作的努力和贡献表示敬意。谨祝中国福利会在祖国伟大的社会主义建设中，在为妇女和儿童的福利事业中，取得更大的发展和成就。
