    Mobilize the Masses, Press the Attack, Persevere Unremittingly, Continue the Fight
    Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work Develops at High Speed
    In Five Months, 910,000 Patients Treated and 1.5 Billion Square Meters of Snails Eliminated Nationwide
    (Our Newspaper's Report) Since the beginning of this year, the speed of schistosomiasis prevention and control work nationwide has greatly accelerated, achieving significant results. Currently, the broad masses in schistosomiasis-endemic areas are continuing to exert their utmost effort, pressing the attack, engaging in repeated struggles, and striving to complete and overfulfill this year's planned tasks, laying a solid foundation for the eradication of schistosomiasis.
    According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of May, twelve provinces and municipalities in schistosomiasis-endemic areas nationwide have treated over 915,000 patients, exceeding the total number of patients treated in 1956 and 1957 combined; eliminated over 1.535 billion square meters of snails, close to the total area of snails eliminated in 1956 and 1957; forty-three new basically snail-free counties and municipalities, and six hundred and ninety-two snail-free townships and towns have emerged; according to statistics from five provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and Shanghai, 1,104 townships and towns have implemented fecal management, accounting for 23.8% of the number that should be managed; Yujiang County in Jiangxi Province, which basically eliminated schistosomiasis last year, has eradicated schistosomiasis; eight counties and municipalities and one hundred and sixteen townships and towns have basically eliminated schistosomiasis.
    In terms of treatment, due to prevention and control personnel breaking with convention and innovating technology, the movement to improve the efficiency of medical work, which is widely carried out in various schistosomiasis-endemic areas, fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of prevention and control personnel. To ensure the speed of treatment and the quality of treatment, the Party secretaries of each township mobilized the masses to supply fecal samples in a planned and continuous manner, organized cleaners and others to do nursing work, and vacated offices to serve as wards. They also mobilized each commune and team to arrange for the patients' production and housework, and organized supply and marketing, commercial, and other departments to supply patients with nutritious foods such as pork and tofu, and helped patients with difficulties to find ways to solve the problems of lacking money and food, so that patients could receive medical treatment with peace of mind. After Hunan launched the movement to improve the efficiency of treatment, the number of patients admitted to each treatment group surged. In May, the province admitted a total of 70,000 patients, equivalent to 140% of the total number of 50,000 patients admitted from January to April.
    In terms of prevention, in addition to adopting methods such as burning reed marshes, using drugs to kill snails, and reclaiming land with tractors according to local conditions and circumstances, the broad masses in schistosomiasis-endemic areas have, since this spring, combined with water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline production, etc., using the "one shot, three hits" and "one shot, five hits" methods, to launch a large-scale mass blitz snail-killing movement, which more concentratedly demonstrates the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Kunshan and Jiading in Jiangsu Province mobilized the vast majority of the county's labor force, drained the water from thousands of rivers, and leveled the riverbeds and banks so that they were "three-sided smooth" and "five-sided smooth," which not only eliminated snails but also built water conservancy projects. According to calculations, the masses in Kunshan combined prevention and control work to build over 7 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy. Wuhu County in Anhui Province mobilized 200,000 people to fight continuously for eighteen days, digging up over 2.62 million square meters of snail soil, achieving the target of a basically snail-free county.
    Regarding fecal management and protection work, under the unified arrangement of Party committees at all levels in various localities, the masses have also created many good and economical methods. For example, after the broad masses generally recognized that doing a good job in fecal management had five major benefits (namely, increasing the quantity of fertilizer, improving the quality of fertilizer, reducing flies, killing insect eggs, and improving environmental sanitation), many places used fecal tanks and fecal pools to ferment fertilizer, and some places even combined the production of granular fertilizer and biogas power generation to carry out harmless treatment of feces. After Hunan Province strengthened fecal management, the phenomenon of defecating in the wild has now been basically eliminated, and work to kill insect eggs and apply fertilizer safely is being widely carried out. In Anhui, more than 850,000 households have managed feces, accounting for 96.4% of the total number of households in the province.
    For protection work, the masses in various localities have created many kinds of ointments for application when going into the water, and made cloth sock covers.
    Although the schistosomiasis prevention and control work in the past few months has achieved great results, compared with this year's planned tasks, especially compared with the overall task of basically eliminating schistosomiasis, the distance is still very far. And the distance is even greater in places where work is progressing more slowly. In order to mobilize the masses to press the attack and continue the fight with perseverance, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Nine-Person Leading Group for Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control recently put forward some suggestions to the schistosomiasis-endemic areas. In order to implement the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, it is required that everyone fully recognize the great significance of doing a good job in the full year's work this year for completing the overall task of schistosomiasis prevention and control, and recognize the arduousness and complexity of the current tasks. Places that have achieved preliminary results must not be complacent and slacken their efforts; places where work is progressing slowly should not be content with falling behind. The notice also requires all localities to start planning for the work after the autumn harvest and next year as early as possible. Currently, the Party committees at all levels in the schistosomiasis-endemic areas have attached importance to these issues. For example, Fujian Province is seizing the current agricultural slack season to mobilize the masses to launch a large-scale blitz snail-killing movement; Hunan Province is arranging the work of reviewing the treatment situation as early as possible before the schistosomiasis patients in the province are completely cured; Yujiang County in Jiangxi Province, which has eradicated schistosomiasis, has put forward five tasks in order to consolidate the achievements and permanently eliminate the scourge of schistosomiasis: ① Concentrated treatment of forty-nine late-stage patients with other diseases; ② Further review of the cattle suffering from schistosomiasis that have already been treated; ③ Strengthening personal protection when fishermen go to schistosomiasis-endemic areas in other places; ④ Strictly implementing the system, strengthening fecal management, and vigorously carrying out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene; ⑤ In all snail-eliminated areas, adopt the method of dividing areas into sections, contracting them to teams and groups, consolidating them for a long time, and being responsible to the end.

    发动群众　乘胜追击　坚持不懈　继续战斗
    血吸虫病防治工作高速度发展
    五个月全国治疗九十一万病人，灭螺十五亿多平方公尺
    本报讯　今年以来，全国血吸虫病防治工作的速度大大加快，获得了巨大的成绩。目前，血吸虫病流行区的广大群众正继续鼓足干劲，乘胜追击，反复斗争，力争完成和超额完成今年的计划任务，为根除血吸虫病打下牢靠的基础。
    据不完全统计，截至5月底止，全国血吸虫病流行区的十二个省、市，已治疗九十一万五千多病人，比1956和1957年治疗病人总和还要多；消灭钉螺十五亿三千五百多万平方公尺，近于1956和1957年消灭钉螺面积的总和，新出现四十三个基本无螺县、市，六百九十二个无螺乡、镇；实行粪便管理的，据江苏、江西、湖南、四川、上海等五个省市的统计，已有一千一百零四个乡、镇，占应管数的23.8％；去年基本消灭血吸虫病的江西省余江县，已根除了血吸虫病；基本消灭血吸虫病的有八个县、市和一百十六个乡、镇。
    在治疗方面，由于防治人员打破常规，革新技术，在各血吸虫病流行区普遍开展的提高医疗工作效率运动，充分表现了防治人员的干劲。为了保证治疗的速度，并保证治疗的质量，各乡党委书记发动群众有计划地源源供应粪检的标本，组织清洁员等做护理工作，腾出办公室作病房。并发动各社各队安排好病人的生产和家务，组织供销、商业等部门供给病人猪肉、豆腐等营养食品，帮助有困难的病人想法解决缺钱缺粮问题，使病人安心就医。湖南开展治疗提高工作效率运动以后，各治疗组收治病人激增。全省在5月份收治病人共达七万，相当于1到4月份收治病人总数五万的140％。
    在预防方面，对于钉螺，各血吸虫病流行区的广大群众除了根据各地的情况和条件，采用火烧芦滩、药物灭杀和拖拉机围垦等办法以外，今春以来，各地结合兴修水利、积肥和副业生产等“一炮三响”“一炮五响”的办法，展开大规模的群众性的突击灭螺运动，更集中地表现了群众的干劲和创造性。江苏省昆山、嘉定动员全县绝大部分劳动力，车干了几千条河的水，把河床、河岸铲得“三面光”“五面光”，既消灭了钉螺，又兴修了水利。据计算，昆山群众结合防治工作兴修水利七百多万土方。安徽芜湖县发动二十万人连战十八天，挖螺土二百六十二万多平方公尺，实现了基本无螺县的指标。
    对粪便管理和防护工作，在各地各级党委的统一安排下，群众也创造了许多又好又省的办法。如广大群众普遍认识到做好粪便管理，有五大好处（即增加肥料数量，提高肥料质量，少苍蝇，杀死虫卵和改善环境卫生）后，很多地方都以粪缸和粪池沤粪，有的地方还结合搞颗粒肥料和沼气发电，对粪便进行无害化处理。湖南省在加强粪便管理工作以后，现在已基本上消灭痾野屎的现象，并正在普遍地开展杀虫卵和安全施肥的工作。安徽已有八十五万多户对粪便进行了管理，占全省总户数的96.4％。
    对于防护工作，各地群众已创造出许多种下水用的涂抹药膏，做布袜套。
    前几个月的血吸虫病防治工作，虽然获得了巨大的成绩，但是对照今年的计划任务，特别是对照基本消灭血吸虫病的总任务来说，距离还很远。而工作开展较慢的地方，距离就更远。为发动群众乘胜追击，坚持不懈的继续战斗，最近中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组对血吸虫病流行地区提出几点意见。为了贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，要求大家充分认识做好今年全年工作对完成血吸虫病防治工作总任务的重大意义，认识当前任务的艰巨性和复杂性。已经获得初步成绩的地方，不能自满松劲；工作开展缓慢的地方，不应安于落后。通知并要求各地对秋后和明年的工作及早着手规划。目前各血吸虫病流行区的各级党委对这些问题已引起重视，如福建省正在抓紧当前农隙，发动群众开展大规模的突击灭螺运动；湖南省在将要治完全省血吸虫病人之前，就及早布置复查治疗情况的工作；已经根除血吸虫病的江西省余江县，为了巩固成绩，永绝血吸虫病的后患，又提出五项任务：①把四十九个夹有别种病的晚期病人，进行集中治疗；②已经治疗的患血吸虫病的耕牛，还要进一步复查；③渔民到外地血吸虫病流行区时，要加强个人防护；④严格执行制度，加强粪便管理，大力开展除四害、讲卫生运动；⑤凡是灭螺地段，采取划区分段，包给队组，长期巩固，负责到底。
