    Let's All Paint Murals
    Murals have a long and time-honored tradition in our country. The ancient murals left behind in places like the Dunhuang Grottoes allow us to understand the lives of ancient people. Today, as socialist construction leaps forward, many excellent folk songs are emerging in various places, which we need to collect; and new murals are also appearing. For example, in rural areas such as Anxing Township in my county, inspiring new murals are painted everywhere. The content includes "Riding a Thousand-Li Horse," depictions of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains and Wu Song Beating the Tiger, and even agricultural development program diagrams. Farmers like to look at these new murals, which have played a significant role in promoting the great leap forward in rural production. They also record the battle achievements of this generation. Therefore, I suggest that art workers across the country go to the streets and to the countryside to create a large number of inspiring new murals.

    大家都来画壁画
    壁画，在我国是有悠久历史传统的。如敦煌石窟等留下的不少古代的壁画，使我们了解了古代人民的生活情况。今天，社会主义建设飞跃前进，各地不但产生了很多优秀的民歌，需要我们采风；而且也出现了新的壁画。如我县安兴乡等地农村里到处画着鼓动人心的新壁画，内容有“骑上千里马”的，有画愚公移山、武松打虎的，也有画上农业发展纲要图解的。以上这些新壁画，农民都喜欢看，对于农村生产大跃进起了很大的宣传鼓动作用。也记录了这一代人的战迹。因此我建议全国美术工作者，走上街头、走到农村，大量创制鼓动人心的新壁画。
