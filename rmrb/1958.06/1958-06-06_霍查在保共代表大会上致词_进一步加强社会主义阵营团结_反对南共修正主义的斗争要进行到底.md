Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 4th: Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered a congratulatory speech at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on June 3rd.

He first congratulated the Congress and the entire Bulgarian people, wishing them even greater achievements in socialist construction.

He then spoke of the long-standing friendship between the Albanian and Bulgarian peoples. He pointed out that this friendship has been further developed and consolidated in the common cause of the two countries' national liberation struggles, socialist construction, and the defense of peace.

Hoxha continued, our strength lies in the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. Today, the unity of the socialist camp is not only of decisive significance for safeguarding our independence and smoothly building our countries, but also a powerful guarantee for maintaining peace and a great guarantee for a better future for mankind. Therefore, we believe that our most sacred duty is to safeguard and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, and strengthen our friendship with the Soviet Union, as if protecting our own eyes.

Hoxha said that it is precisely because of this that the imperialists regard our unity as the main obstacle to the realization of their plans, and they are doing everything possible to try to disintegrate the socialist camp and the international communist movement. Modern revisionism is precisely serving them vigorously in this regard. The revisionist clique of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia opposes the leading role of the party and opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat. This group has taken it upon itself to oppose the unity of the glorious socialist camp. However, this group is bound to go bankrupt. Our communist and workers' parties have done our best to help the Yugoslav leadership abandon the anti-Marxist road, but they have ignored our efforts. All their activities are hostile attacks on the socialist camp and Marxism-Leninism, which show that they firmly stand on an anti-Marxist and revisionist position. The path taken by the Yugoslav leaders is not in the interests of socialism, but is boosting the power of imperialism.

Hoxha said that our party and our country have suffered greatly from the anti-Marxist activities of the Yugoslav leaders. Despite this, we still express our full support for the initiative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to improve our relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. We believe that this initiative is very correct, and it is in the interests of the Yugoslav people, the interests of our people, and the interests of the international communist movement. However, the Yugoslav leaders have not only failed to respond to our efforts, but have continued to follow its anti-Marxist path. The Yugoslav leaders insist that our parties' correct criticism of the anti-Marxist stance of the Yugoslav leaders is directed against the Yugoslav people. This is a slander, an attempt to arouse hostile sentiments among the Yugoslav people towards their true friends, towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Our parties have always fought and will continue to fight to strengthen friendship with the Yugoslav people. However, no Marxist-Leninist can fail to wage an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism.

Hoxha said that at present, revisionism is the main danger to the international communist and workers' movement. Therefore, it is necessary to expose revisionism and carry the unwavering struggle against revisionism through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 4th: Jaromír Dolanský, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, delivered a congratulatory speech at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on June 3rd.

Dolanský said that the people of Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are linked by a sincere love for the Soviet Union, and the Communist Parties of Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are linked by an infinite loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Dolanský pointed out that the Communist Parties of Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are working hard to strengthen the unity of socialist countries and fraternal parties in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and are determined to fulfill their internationalist obligations and unswervingly fight against revisionism. Dolanský pointed out that all efforts must be made to support the crushing of the imperialist plan to revive German militarism. He said that we must never again allow the terrible specter of military violence rising in West Germany to threaten the freedom and independence of our two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 5th: The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party concluded this morning its discussion on the summary reports of the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission. In the afternoon, the third item on the agenda began -- the report by Yugov on the draft directives for the Seventh Congress on Bulgaria's Third Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy from 1958 to 1962.

The discussion on the summary report of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party lasted for two and a half days, and nearly thirty delegates spoke at the congress. They unanimously expressed their complete agreement with the report, and emphasized the great achievements made by Bulgaria in socialist construction, affirming the correctness of the leadership of the Central Committe of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the superiority of socialism. They unanimously stated that they would unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Party.

In their speeches, the delegates criticized modern revisionism represented by the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The delegates pointed out that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is completely contrary to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and is beneficial to imperialism, and must be fought against mercilessly.

At the afternoon session on the 4th, representatives of the fraternal parties of North Korea, Vietnam, and Algeria delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.

    霍查在保共代表大会上致词
    进一步加强社会主义阵营团结
    反对南共修正主义的斗争要进行到底
    据新华社索非亚4日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查3日在保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会上致贺词。
    他首先向代表大会和全体保加利亚人民祝贺，祝他们在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。
    他接着谈到阿保两国人民具有悠久历史的友谊。他指出，这种友谊已经在两国的民族解放斗争、社会主义建设和保卫和平的共同事业中获得进一步发展和巩固。
    霍查接着说，我们的力量在于以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营。今天的社会主义阵营的团结一致，不仅对于维护我们的独立和顺利地建设我们的国家具有决定性的意义，而且也是维护和平的有力保证和争取人类美好前途的巨大保证。因此我们认为，我们最神圣的职责是：像保护自己的眼珠一样地维护和加强社会主义阵营的团结一致，加强我们同苏联的友谊。
    霍查说，正因为如此，帝国主义者就把我们的团结一致看成是实现他们计划的道路上的主要障碍，他们用尽一切办法企图瓦解社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动。现代修正主义正好在这方面为他们大力效劳。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义集团反对党的领导作用，反对无产阶级专政。这个集团以反对光荣的社会主义阵营的团结为己任。但是，这个集团必定要破产。我们共产党和工人党进行了仁至义尽的工作来帮助南共的领导抛弃反马克思主义的道路，但是他们无视我们的努力。他们的全部活动是对社会主义阵营和马克思列宁主义的敌对攻击，这表明他们坚决地站在反马克思主义的和修正主义的立场上。南共领导人所走的道路并不是为社会主义的利益服务的，而是助长帝国主义的声势。
    霍查说，我们党和我们国家受了南共领导人反马克思主义活动的很大危害。尽管如此，我们仍然表示完全支持苏联共产党关于改善我们同南共关系的倡议，我们认为这个倡议非常正确，它符合南斯拉夫人民的利益、我们各国人民和国际共产主义运动的利益。但是南斯拉夫的领导人不仅没有响应我们的努力，反而继续走它的反马克思主义的道路。南斯拉夫的领导人硬说我们这些党对南共领导人的反马克思主义立场的正确批评是针对着南斯拉夫人民的。这是诬蔑，是企图激起南斯拉夫人民对他们的真正朋友，对苏联和其他社会主义国家的敌对情绪。我们这些党过去一贯是而且将来也要为加强同南斯拉夫人民的友谊而斗争。但是，任何一个马克思—列宁主义者都不能不对修正主义进行毫不调和的斗争。
    霍查说，目前修正主义是对国际共产主义运动和工人运动的主要危险，因此必须揭露修正主义，并且把反对修正主义的毫不动摇的斗争进行到底。
    据新华社索非亚4日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员柯别茨基3日在保共第七次代表大会上致祝词。
    柯别茨基说，捷保两国人民是以对苏联的真诚的热爱联系在一起的，捷保两国共产党是以对马克思列宁主义原则、对伟大的苏联共产党的无限忠诚联结在一起的。柯别茨基指出，捷保两国共产党都努力以无产阶级国际主义的精神加强社会主义国家和兄弟党的团结，并且决定履行自己的国际主义义务，始终不渝地对修正主义进行斗争。柯别茨基指出，必须全力支持粉碎帝国主义复活德国军国主义的计划。他说，我们任何时候都再不能允许在西德兴起的可怕的军事暴力的怪影威胁着我们两国的自由和独立。
    据新华社索非亚5日电　保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会今天上午结束了对中央委员会和中央检查委员会的总结报告的讨论。下午开始进行第三项议程——于哥夫报告第七次代表大会关于1958年到1962年保加利亚发展国民经济的第三个五年计划的指示草案。
    会议对保共中央的总结报告讨论了两天半，将近三十个代表在大会上发了言。他们一致表示完全赞同这个报告，并且强调指出了保加利亚在社会主义建设方面所取得的巨大成就，确认保共中央领导的正确和社会主义的优越性。他们一致表示，他们将更加紧密地团结在党中央周围。
    代表们在发言中批判了以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义。代表们指出，南共纲领是完全违背马克思列宁主义原则的，是有利于帝国主义的，必须对它进行无情的斗争。
    在4日下午的会议上，朝鲜、越南和阿尔及利亚的兄弟党的代表向大会致祝词。
