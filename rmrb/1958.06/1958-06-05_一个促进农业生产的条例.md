　　A Regulation to Promote Agricultural Production
    The Agricultural Tax Regulation of the People's Republic of China has been approved and promulgated by the 96th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The agricultural tax law is a major law of the country, which is related to the major policies such as the unity of more than 500 million farmers, the development of agricultural production, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the accumulation of national construction funds, so everyone is very concerned about it. The Ministry of Finance has made a detailed explanation of the principles for formulating the new agricultural tax regulation, and here we would like to add some opinions on the basic spirit of this regulation.
    There are several noteworthy points in this regulation. First of all, the new agricultural tax regulation runs through the fundamental policy of promoting the development of agricultural production from beginning to end. On the one hand, the new agricultural tax regulation has made some important changes to the original agricultural tax system based on individual economy in accordance with the new situation after agricultural cooperation, so that it is fully adapted to the new relations of production after agricultural cooperation; on the other hand, it also summarizes the past experience and retains the effective provisions in the original agricultural tax collection methods, especially the provisions that are conducive to promoting the development of agricultural production. Therefore, the implementation of this regulation will be more conducive to the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative system and further encourage farmers to increase production. This will be a powerful coordination for the great struggle to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
    The fundamental issue of social development is the issue of production, the issue of continuously developing social productive forces. Whether a government is a "promoting government" or a "hindering government," the important sign lies in whether it can promote the development of productive forces. The work guidelines, policies, and rules and regulations formulated by the government are an integral part of the superstructure. The superstructure must meet the needs of the economic base. The main sign of whether the guidelines, policies, and rules and regulations are correct is also whether they are conducive to the development of production. Those that can promote the development of production are correct; those that hinder the development of production are wrong. However, things are always developing in contradictions. Contradictions often occur between the superstructure and the economic base. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will appear. Some rules and regulations were originally correct, timely, and promoted the development of production, but after the situation changed, they became inapplicable and, in turn, hindered the development of production. This is the law of development of objective things, which cannot be changed by people's will. Under the socialist system, contradictions are still inevitably occurring between the superstructure and the economic base. Our task is to adjust in a timely manner certain contradictions between various parts and links of the superstructure and the economic base, and to reform in a timely manner those rules and regulations that are no longer compatible with the socialist economic base, restrict the development of productive forces, and bind the enthusiasm of the masses, so that the superstructure can more effectively serve the economic base. In recent years, various departments of the government and various localities have formulated many kinds of rules and regulations, which have played an important role in promoting socialist transformation and socialist construction. However, some of them were originally correct, but now, due to the fundamental transformation and vigorous development of our country's economy, the situation has undergone fundamental changes, and they have become inapplicable. For example, the industrial and commercial tax collection system and certain rules and regulations implemented by the financial and trade departments that were originally intended to transform capitalist industry and commerce once played a significant role in transforming capitalist industry and commerce. Now, capitalist industry and commerce have been entirely converted into joint state-private ownership, the relations of production have fundamentally changed, and the original free market has been replaced by the current organized socialist unified market. Obviously, such rules and regulations must be reformed; if they continue to be implemented, they will inevitably affect the further development of production. We hope that all departments of the government and all localities will universally examine all existing rules and regulations and revise those outdated and unreasonable rules and regulations to adapt to the current new situation.
    Another noteworthy point of the new agricultural tax regulation is that it fully embodies the flexibility of adapting to local conditions under unified guidelines and policies. This regulation has made unified provisions for major policy issues that must be unified, and has made flexible provisions for many issues that do not need to be unified, giving local people's committees greater discretionary power. For example, the tax rate of the new agricultural tax is stipulated to be an average of 15.5% of the normal annual output nationwide, and the highest tax rate does not exceed 25% of the normal annual output, and the method of stipulating differential tax rates at each level is adopted. This enables local people's committees to better arrange the burden of farmers in their respective regions according to local conditions, and avoid the unreasonable phenomenon of excessively light or heavy burdens on farmers. Obviously, such regulations are very necessary and conform to the actual situation in rural areas of our country.
    Some comrades worry that delegating some authority to the local authorities will mess things up. This worry is groundless. Take the improvement of the financial management system at the beginning of this year as an example. At first, many comrades had many concerns, such as fearing that the decentralization of funds would affect key construction projects, and fearing that it would affect the balance of finance and economy, and so on. But facts have proved that these concerns are unnecessary and are a kind of conservative thinking that hinders the development of productive forces. Before the improvement of the financial management system, because financial power was concentrated in the central government, the local governments could only handle affairs according to the money and planned projects given by the state. Therefore, it was very difficult to balance the central and local budgets every year. The local governments wanted more, but the central government gave less. This not only increased a lot of administrative work, but more importantly, it could not fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the local governments and restricted the development of productive forces. After delegating some financial management authority to the local governments, the enthusiasm of the local governments to tap potential, organize income, and develop production was quickly brought into play. For example, this year, the central government only allocated 120 million yuan of basic construction investment to Hubei Province, but the province tried to save administrative expenses and organize income from all aspects, so that the basic construction investment increased to 400 million yuan. Shandong, Henan, Yunnan and other provinces have also relied on organizing local income to greatly increase basic construction investment. Although our country's rural areas carried out such large-scale water conservancy construction projects last winter and this spring, and developed so many local industries, no province has asked the state for more money. It can be seen that it is completely necessary, correct, and timely to appropriately expand the local authority to manage finances, give the local governments more discretionary financial resources on the premise of ensuring the state's key construction projects, so as to further mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the local governments to accumulate funds, increase income, and save expenditures, thereby promoting the development of our country's socialist construction cause. Our country has a vast territory, complex conditions, and very uneven economic development in various places. It is completely necessary to give the local people's committees greater discretionary power, so that under the unified leadership of the central government, the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the local governments can be fully brought into play, so that the implementation of the central government's various guidelines and policies can better adapt to the different conditions of various regions, thereby greatly promoting the development of our country's socialist construction cause. This is what all central departments must consider when formulating rules and regulations. Is there anything to doubt?
    Another noteworthy point in this regulation is that it fully embodies the principle of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. How much burden farmers bear is the substantive issue of agricultural tax. The Ministry of Finance mentioned in the explanation on the Agricultural Tax Regulation (Draft) that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, after a slight increase in the burden of farmers and some reasonable adjustments between regions, the policy of "increasing production without increasing taxes" will still be adopted. According to this policy, what will be the burden of farmers in the future? According to the current situation of the great leap in agricultural production, according to the lowest estimate, if agricultural production increases by an average of 10% per year during the Second Five-Year Plan period, then it will increase by more than 60% by 1962 compared with 1957. Since the agricultural tax levy amount remains basically unchanged, the proportion of agricultural tax in the actual output will gradually decrease from 11.3% in 1957 to about 7% in 1962. In this way, a large part of the increased agricultural production will be used to increase the public accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives, so as to rely on the cooperatives' own financial and material resources, under the leadership of the Party and the support of the state, to go all out, aim high, and build rural socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, so as to rely on the endless strength and wisdom of the farmers across the country to accelerate the transformation of the countryside. Only in this way can we better implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, and simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, so as

### 一个促进农业生产的条例

　　一个促进农业生产的条例
    中华人民共和国农业税条例，已经由全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十六次会议批准，并公布施行。农业税法是国家的一个大法，它关系到对五亿多农民的团结、农业生产的发展、农民生活的改善和国家建设资金的积累等等重大方针政策问题，所以大家都很关心。关于制定新农业税条例的原则根据，财政部已作了详细的说明，这里我们再就这个条例的基本精神说一点意见。
    在这个条例中，有几点值得注意的地方。首先是新的农业税条例从头到尾贯串着促进农业生产的发展这一根本方针。新的农业税条例一方面根据农业合作化以后的新情况，对原来以个体经济为基础的农业税收制度作了若干重要的改变，使它和农业合作化以后的新的生产关系完全相适应；另一方面，也总结了过去的经验，把原来农业税征收办法中行之有效的规定，特别是有利于促进农业生产发展的各项规定，都保留了下来。因此，这个条例实施的结果，必将更加有利于农业合作化制度的巩固和进一步鼓励农民增加生产的积极性。这对于提前实现全国农业发展纲要的伟大斗争，将是一个有力的配合。
    社会发展的根本问题，是生产问题，是不断发展社会生产力的问题。一个政府，是“促进政府”，还是“促退政府”，重要的标志就在于它能不能促进生产力的发展。政府所制定的工作方针政策和规章制度，是上层建筑一个组成部分。上层建筑必须适合经济基础的需要。方针政策和规章制度定得是否正确，主要的标志也是看它是否有利于生产的发展。能够促进生产发展的，就是正确的；阻碍生产发展的，就是错误的。但是，事物永远是在矛盾中发展。上层建筑和经济基础之间经常会发生这样或那样的矛盾。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾还会出现。一部分规章制度原来是正确的、适时的、是促进生产发展的，但在情况发生变化以后，就不适用了，反过来又会阻碍生产的发展。这是客观事物发展的规律，不是人们的意志可以改变的。社会主义制度下的上层建筑和经济基础之间，也仍然不可避免地会发生这样或那样的矛盾。我们的任务，就在于要及时地调整上层建筑各个部分、各个环节同经济基础之间的某些矛盾，及时地改革那些已同社会主义的经济基础不相适应、限制生产力发展、束缚群众积极性的规章制度，使上层建筑更有效地为经济基础服务。几年来，政府各部门和各地方制定了很多各种各样的规章制度，对于社会主义改造和社会主义建设起了重要的促进作用。但是，其中也有一部分原来是正确的，现在由于我国经济的根本改造和大力发展，情况发生了根本性质的变化，就变成不适用的了。比如，工商业税征收制度和财贸部门实施的原来旨在改造资本主义工商业的某些规章制度，对于改造资本主义工商业曾经起了重大的作用，现在资本主义工商业已经全行业公私合营，生产关系已经根本改变，原来的自由市场已被现在的有组织的社会主义统一市场所代替。显然，这类规章制度就非要改革不可了；如果继续实施下去，就必然要影响到生产的进一步发展。我们希望政府各部门和各地方都来普遍地检查一次现行的一切规章制度，对那些已经过时的不合理的规章制度加以修改，以适应当前的新形势。
    新的农业税条例另一个值得注意的地方，是在统一的方针政策下，充分体现了因地制宜的灵活性。这个条例，对于必须统一的重大政策问题，都作了统一的规定，对于可以不必统一的许多问题，都作了灵活的规定，给予地方人民委员会以较大的机动权力。例如新农业税的税率，规定在全国平均为常年产量的15.5％和最高税率不超过常年产量的25％的范围内，采取逐级规定差别税率的办法，这就可以使地方人民委员会更能够因地制宜地来安排所属各地区的农民负担，避免发生农民负担畸轻畸重的不合理现象。显然，这样的规定是很必要的，是符合我国农村的实际情况的。
    有些同志担心，把一部分权限下放给地方会把事情搞乱了，这种担心是毫无根据的。就拿今年初改进财政管理体制为例吧。起初，也有不少同志顾虑重重，如怕资金分散影响重点建设，怕影响财政和经济的平衡，等等。但事实证明了这些顾虑都是不必要的，是一种妨碍生产力发展的保守思想。在改进财政管理体制以前，由于财权集中在中央，地方上只能根据国家给的钱和计划的项目办事，因此每年平衡中央和地方的预算都很困难，地方要得多，中央给的少。这不仅增加了很多事务工作，更重要的是不能充分发挥地方的积极性，限制了生产力的发展。把一部分财政管理权限下放给地方以后，地方上挖掘潜力、组织收入、发展生产的积极性很快就发挥出来了。例如，今年中央分配给湖北省的基本建设投资只有一亿二千万元，可是省里却从节省事业费开支和组织各方面收入想办法，使基建投资增加到四亿元。山东、河南、云南等省也都依靠组织地方收入大量地增加了基建投资。虽然在去冬今春我国农村进行了那样大规模的水利建设工程，发展了那么多的地方工业，可是并没有一个省再向国家多要钱的。由此可见，适当地扩大地方管理财政的权限，在保证国家重点建设的前提下多给地方若干机动财力，以便进一步发挥地方积累资金、增加收入、节约支出的积极性和创造性，从而推动我国社会主义建设事业的发展，这是完全必要的、正确的和适时的。我国幅员广大，情况复杂，各地经济发展很不平衡，完全有必要给予地方人民委员会以较大的机动权力，以便在中央统一领导之下，充分发挥地方的积极性、主动性和创造性，使中央的各项方针政策的实施能够更好地适应各地区的不同情况，从而大大推动我国社会主义建设事业的发展。这是所有中央各部门在制定规章制度时所必需考虑的，难道还有什么可以怀疑的吗？
    在这个条例中还有一个值得注意的地方，是充分地体现了兼顾国家、集体和个人三方面利益的原则。农民负担多少，是农业税的实质问题。财政部在关于农业税条例（草案）的说明中提到，第二个五年计划期间，在农民负担稍有增加，并在地区之间进行某些合理调整以后，仍然采取增产不增税的方针。按照这个方针今后农民的负担情况怎样呢？根据目前农业生产大跃进的形势，按照最低的估计，在第二个五年计划期间的农业生产，如果每年平均递增10％，那么，到1962年将比1957年增长60％以上。由于农业税征收额基本不变，农业税占实际产量的比例将由1957年的11.3％，逐渐下降到1962年的7％左右。这样，农业增产的部分，将有很大一部分是用来增加农业生产合作社的公共积累，以便依靠合作社自己的财力和物力，在党的领导和国家的支援之下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地进行农村社会主义建设，以便依靠全国农民无穷无尽的力量和智慧，加速改变农村的面貌。只有这样，才能很好地贯彻在重工业优先发展的条件下工业和农业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，从而尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    毫无疑问，新的农业税条例是一个促进农业生产发展的条例，它的实施必然会受到广大农民的热烈拥护。
