Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 2nd. Yesterday, when the National Assembly was discussing the issue of authorizing De Gaulle to form a government, the working people and republicans in Paris and many other cities held demonstrations against De Gaulle coming to power, despite the suppression by the military police authorities.

　　In Paris, despite the authorities mobilizing a large number of armed police to block traffic arteries and dispatching helicopters and police aircraft in an attempt to stop the just demonstrations of the masses, demonstrations against De Gaulle coming to power were still held in various districts and suburbs of Paris. They held high the tricolor flag and tricolor wreaths and bouquets of the French Republic, chanting slogans such as "Defend the Republic" and "De Gaulle Must Not Come to Power." In the Latin Quarter, the cries of "Long Live the Republic" and "No to De Gaulle" resounded throughout all the streets. When a procession of thousands of people marched towards Barbes Street and passed Clichy Square, the masses walking on the sidewalks went to the streets to join the march. At the intersection of Ornano Avenue and Ordener Road and on Saint-Michel Boulevard in northern Paris, thousands of demonstrators clashed with the police. A contingent of two thousand people starting from Montreuil marched to the Père Lachaise Cemetery, the burial place of the martyrs of the Paris Commune of 1871, and laid hundreds of bouquets in front of the cemetery, expressing their firm will to oppose fascism.

　　In the provinces, mass demonstrations to defend the Republic were also held in Marseille, Lyon, Nantes, Bordeaux, Brest, Nice, Limousin, Saint-Brieuc, Montpellier and many other cities.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 2nd. Étienne Fajon, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, published an article in "L'Humanité" on June 2nd on the domestic situation after De Gaulle took power, saying that no matter what obstacles appear on the road ahead, the great French people will firmly hold high the banner of freedom.

　　Fajon wrote that De Gaulle made his appearance. He came to power with the help of violence and the support of the likes of Mollet, who betrayed their parliamentary duties, the Republic, and their own party, deliberately leading the country onto a path of adventure. The situation is serious, and the democratic system is suffering a serious threat.

　　Fajon then pointed out that this is only one aspect of the development of the situation. All problems remain to be solved. Although a dictatorial individual has come to power, the French people possess the basic strength to force a just solution. In this worrying month, the French Communist Party, united as one, has further enhanced its prestige. Yesterday's (parliamentary) debate reflected the love of freedom of the Socialist masses and Republican masses, demonstrating their firm will to defend freedom. At such a time, it is no small thing that forty-nine Socialist deputies and many Republicans stood with us to vote.

　　After mentioning the mass demonstrations to defend the Republic held in Paris and throughout France, Fajon said that the action against fascism will not end with a parliamentary meeting. On the contrary, this action will continue and is more necessary and more urgent than before. The development of the situation has not affected the possibility of victory in the slightest.

　　反对戴高乐上台
    法国各城市举行示威游行
    法戎指出法国人民将高举自由旗帜
    新华社巴黎2日电  昨天当国民议会讨论授权戴高乐组织政府问题的时候，巴黎和其他许多城市的劳动人民和共和人士不顾军警当局的镇压举行了反对戴高乐上台的示威游行。
    在巴黎，尽管当局调集大批武装警察封锁了交通要道并且出动了直升飞机和警用飞机企图制止人民群众的正义的示威游行，但巴黎各区和郊区仍然举行了反对戴高乐上台的示威游行。他们高举着法兰西共和国三色国旗和三色花环、花束，高呼
  “保卫共和国”和“不许戴高乐上台”的口号。在拉丁区，“共和国万岁”和“不要戴高乐”的呼声响彻了所有的街道。当数千人组成的游行队伍走向巴尔勃街经过克里希广场时，在人行道上行走的群众纷纷走到大街参加游行。在巴黎北部奥纳诺大街和奥当纳路路口及圣密歇尔大街，数以千计的参加示威游行的群众和警察发生了冲突。从蒙特勒伊出发的一支由两千人组成的队伍游行到法国1871年巴黎公社先烈们的墓地——拉歇神甫公墓，在公墓前献了成百把花束，表示他们反对法西斯主义的坚强意志。
    在外省，马赛、里昂、南特、波尔多、布勒斯特、尼萨、利穆桑、圣布利厄、蒙培利埃和其他许多城市也举行了保卫共和国的群众示威游行。
    据新华社巴黎2日电  法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员艾蒂安·法戎2日就戴高乐执政后的国内局势在“人道报”上发表文章说，不管在前进的道路上出现什么障碍，伟大的法国人民将坚定地高高举起自由的旗帜。
    法戎写道，戴高乐粉墨登场了。他是借助于暴力和摩勒之流的支持上台的，摩勒之流背弃了议员职守、共和国和自己的党，蓄意把国家带上冒险的道路。局势是严重的，民主制度遭受着严重的威胁。
    法戎接着指出，但是这只是事态发展的一面。一切问题尚待解决。尽管独裁的个人已经上台，但是法国人民拥有基本的力量来强使实行公正的解决办法。在令人忧虑的这个月份中，团结一致坚如磐石的法国共产党进一步提高了威望。昨天的（议会）辩论反映出社会党群众和共和群众热爱自由，表明他们保卫自由的坚决意志。在这样的时际，四十九名社会党议员和许多共和人士同我们站在一起投票，这不是一件小事情。
    法戎在提到巴黎和法国各地所举行的群众性的保卫共和国的示威游行之后说，对付法西斯主义的行动，不是随着议会举行了一次会议而就此结束的，相反地这种行动将继续下去而且比以前更有必要、更加迫切，事态发展丝毫没有影响取得胜利的可能性。
