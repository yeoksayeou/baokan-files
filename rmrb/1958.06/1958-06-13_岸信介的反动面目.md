    The sixty-two-year-old Nobusuke Kishi is a Japanese militarist who rose to prominence through anti-communism and anti-people activities. In his early years, when he was studying at Tokyo Imperial University, he joined the "Shichiseisha," a reactionary student group most active in persecuting progressive student organizations. His classmate, Japanese Socialist Party member Hyo Hara, once described him in the "Asahi Shimbun" as being full of the stench of fascism.

    After graduating from university, Kishi soon entered the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce as a bureaucrat.

    Kishi participated in the criminal invasion of China very early on. In 1936, he was sent to the puppet "Manchukuo" as a "key figure," serving as "Vice Minister of Industry," responsible for plundering economic resources in Northeast China, and "Vice Minister of General Affairs," overseeing key secrets. He actively promoted the "Manchurian Industrial Development Five-Year Plan," which oppressed and exploited the people of Northeast China, and was known as one of the five major figures who manipulated the puppet "Manchukuo" alongside Kwantung Army warlord leader Hideki Tojo. Later, Kishi joined the cabinet of war criminal Hideki Tojo, who launched the Pacific War, as Minister of Commerce and Industry and Vice Minister of Munitions. He was one of the planners of this war of aggression.

    After Japan's surrender in 1945, Kishi was imprisoned in Sugamo Prison as one of the first Class A war criminals. In 1948, American imperialism arbitrarily released Kishi and removed the "purge" against him in 1952. Kishi was deeply grateful for the "grace" of the United States. After his release from prison, he said: "I died in Sugamo Prison, and my remaining life is a gift."

    After the "purge" against him was lifted, Kishi actively lobbied under the patronage of Japanese monopoly capital. From 1954, he held important positions such as Secretary-General in the then newly established Democratic Party and later in the Liberal Democratic Party, which was formed by the merger of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party. The American ruling group favored this former war criminal, actively supporting him in establishing a pro-American, anti-communist reactionary regime in Japan. In December 1956, Kishi joined the Ishibashi Cabinet as Foreign Minister. In February 1957, after the Ishibashi Cabinet collapsed, he became Prime Minister.

    Since taking office, Kishi has been actively pursuing a policy of subservience to the United States, intensifying the dragging of Japan into the American atomic strategic system, strengthening the suppression of the Japanese people's movements for peace, independence, and democracy, and resolutely antagonizing the Chinese people in order to win the trust of American imperialism.

    To promote this reactionary policy, Kishi hurriedly went to Taiwan and the United States for activities shortly after taking office. Kishi openly courted the US and Chiang Kai-shek, even saying to Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan: "If the mainland is recovered, I think it would be very good." At the same time, Kishi actively worked for the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and protected the Liao Wen-yi group of the so-called "Taiwan Independence League," attempting to once again interfere in China's territory of Taiwan. At the same time, Kishi consistently undermined Sino-Japanese trade and brazenly sabotaged the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement signed by trade groups from the two countries in April this year. After this, the Kishi government even openly condoned thugs creating an incident in Nagasaki that insulted the Chinese national flag.

    Kishi actively followed the American "policy of strength." He violated the will of the Japanese people and openly announced that he "did not want to ask the American Air Force and Navy to withdraw" from Japan. In March of this year, he even said that the United States "has the right" to transport nuclear weapons into Japan, blatantly expressing his determination to implement the US's sinister plan to turn Japan into its atomic base. With American support, he also intensified the rearmament and actively restored Japanese militarism. Kishi also followed the wishes of Japanese monopoly capital, intensifying the implementation of policies to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia. Recently, Kishi has also been plotting to realize the plan for the "Northeast Asia Alliance" aggression group, planned by the United States and composed of Japan, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, and the Syngman Rhee group.

    These perverse actions of Kishi fully expose his hidden imperialist face.

### 岸信介的反动面目

    岸信介的反动面目
    现年六十二岁的岸信介是一个以反共、反人民起家的日本军国主义分子。早年，他在东京帝国大学念书的时候，就参加了迫害进步学生团体最力的反动学生团体“七生社”。他的同学日本社会党议员原彪在“朝日新闻”上曾经描绘他的面目说，岸信介浑身充满了法西斯的臭味。
    岸信介从学校毕业以后，不久就进入农商省充当官僚。
    岸信介很早就参加了侵略中国的罪恶行动。1936年，他被当做“中坚人物”派到伪“满洲国”，担任负责掠夺中国东北经济资源的“产业部次长”和总揽机要的“总务厅次长”等职。他积极推行压迫和榨取中国东北人民的“满洲产业开发五年计划”，和关东军阀首脑东条英机等被称为操纵伪“满洲国”的五大头目。以后，岸信介参加了发动太平洋战争的战犯东条英机的内阁，任商工大臣和军需次官。他是发动这场侵略战争的策划者之一。
    1945年日本投降后，岸信介作为第一批甲级战犯被关进巢鸭监狱。1948年，美帝国主义擅自释放了岸信介，并且在1952年对他解除
  “整肃”。岸信介对美国的“恩典”感激涕零，他出狱后说：“在巢鸭监狱中我已经死亡了，我的余生是一种恩赐”。
    岸信介在被解除“整肃”以后，极力奔走于日本垄断资本的门下。从1954年起，他在当时新成立的民主党和以后由民主党同自由党合并组成的自由民主党中，获得干事长的重要职位。美国统治集团垂青这个前战犯，积极扶植他在日本建立一个亲美反共的反动政权。1956年12月，岸信介参加石桥内阁任外务相。1957年2月，石桥内阁垮台后，他出任了首相。
    岸信介上台以后，为了博取美帝国主义对他的信任，一直积极推行屈从美国、加紧把日本拖进美国的原子战略体制的政策，加强镇压日本人民争取和平、独立和民主的运动，并且坚决与中国人民为敌。
    为了推行这种反动政策，岸信介上台不久，就匆忙跑到台湾和美国去活动。岸信介公然向美蒋讨好，竟在台湾公然对蒋介石说：“如果收复大陆的话，我认为是非常好的”。岸信介同时积极为美国制造
  “两个中国”的阴谋效劳，并且卵翼所谓“台湾独立同盟”的廖文毅集团，企图重新染指中国的领土台湾。同时，岸信介一贯破坏中日贸易，并且在今年4月悍然破坏了中日两国贸易团体签订的第四次中日贸易协定。在这以后，岸信介政府甚至公然纵容暴徒在长崎制造了侮辱中国国旗的事件。
    岸信介积极追随美国的“实力地位政策”，他违背日本人民的意志，曾经公开宣布“不想要求美国空军和海军撤出”日本。今年3月，他甚至说，美国“有权”把核武器运进日本，明目张胆地表示决心执行美国要把日本变成它的原子基地的罪恶计划。他还在美国的支持下，加紧重整军备，并且积极恢复日本的军国主义。岸信介还秉承日本垄断资本的意旨，加紧执行在东南亚进行经济扩张的政策。最近以来，岸信介又在阴谋实现美国策划下的由日本、台湾蒋介石集团和李承晚集团组成的“东北亚同盟”侵略集团的计划。
    岸信介的这些倒行逆施的行为，充分暴露了他的隐藏的帝国主义的面貌。
