Beiliu - Guangxi's First Illiteracy-Free County
96% of Young and Middle-Aged Illiterates Have Learned 1,500 Characters

(Our reporter Shi Zhengyao reports) Beiliu County, based on the characteristics of adults, adopted a rapid literacy method, eliminating illiteracy among 96% of young and middle-aged people in a month and a half. More than 102,000 people can recognize more than 1,500 Chinese characters, making it the first basically illiteracy-free county in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Since the upsurge of the technological revolution, many illiterate people in Beiliu County have been eagerly demanding to master cultural and scientific knowledge. The Party and government leaders of Beiliu County immediately established a unified headquarters for literacy cadres in the county and townships, to unify leadership and arrange production and learning. They also mobilized intellectuals and literate people throughout the county to form a literacy army. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party branches of the agricultural cooperatives, all illiterate people were organized into study classes (groups) according to production teams (groups). A mass literacy movement of thousands teaching and tens of thousands learning began.

In order to learn faster and learn more, Beiliu County changed the old method of slowly reciting literacy textbooks lesson by lesson. Based on the characteristics of adults having poor memory but strong comprehension, they extracted all 1,665 new characters from the three literacy textbooks and then compiled these individual new characters into meaningful sentences, allowing students to learn by understanding the content of the sentences during intensive study. The Liujing District adopted this method, with each person learning 150 to 300 new characters per day. When the masses in Xiangtang Township learned the sentence "Actively top-dress and cultivate the fields to welcome the spring plowing competition," they not only quickly remembered the new characters, but also automatically carried manure to top-dress and cultivate the fields before dawn the next day, playing a role in promoting production.

While intensively studying new characters, they used rotating reading of newspapers and singing folk songs to help students review the new characters, gradually consolidating their knowledge.

In this way, Beiliu County formed an unprecedented and vigorous literacy movement. The idea among the masses that "going to school every year means starting from scratch every year" and "it is easy to enter school but difficult to eliminate illiteracy" completely disappeared, and a grand scene of "new characters flying all over the sky" appeared. For example, in the eight market towns in Liujing District, each shop and stall vendor was a literacy inspection team. The items displayed in their shops were labeled with names, truly "those who teach have opportunities to teach at any time, and those who learn have opportunities to learn at any time."

Now, all townships and cooperatives in the county have widely organized newspaper reading groups, folk song creation groups, and political and technical night schools to meet the needs of the newly literate masses for further improving their cultural level.

### 北流——广西第一个无文盲县  96％的青壮年文盲已经识字一千五

    北流——广西第一个无文盲县
    96％的青壮年文盲已经识字一千五
    本报讯　记者施峥尧报道：北流县根据成年人的特点，采取快速扫盲方法，在一个半月里扫除了96％的青壮年文盲，有十万二千多人认得一千五百个汉字以上，成为广西僮族自治区第一个基本无文盲县。
    自从掀起了技术革命热潮以来，北流县的许多文盲群众如饥如渴地要求掌握文化科学知识。北流县党、政领导立即在县、乡成立了扫盲干部统一指挥部，统一领导和安排生产与学习。并动员全县的知识分子和识字的人组成了扫盲大军。同时在农业社党支部的领导下，把所有的文盲按生产队（组）编成学习班（组）。一个千人教、万人学的扫盲运动便开始了。
    为了学快些、学多些，北流县改变了过去那种按识字课本一课一课慢慢念的老办法。他们根据成年人记忆力差、领会力强的特点，把三册识字课本的一千六百六十五个生字全部抽出来，再将这些单个的生字编成有内容的句子，让学员在大量突击学习句子时，通过理解句子的内容去帮助记忆。六靖区采取这办法，每人每天学会了一百五十至三百个生字。当香塘乡群众学到“积极追肥耘田迎接春耕大评比”这一句时，不但很快地记住了这些生字，并于第二天天未亮时，都自动担粪追肥耘田去了，起了推动生产的作用。
    在突击生字的同时，用轮流朗读报纸和唱山歌，给学员学习生字搬家，逐步巩固。
    这样，北流县便形成了一个规模空前的轰轰烈烈的扫盲运动。群众当中的那种认为“年年入学，年年从头学”和“入学容易扫盲难”的思想完全消失了，出现了“生字满天飞”的盛况。如六靖区八个墟镇，各商店摊贩都是识字检查组，他们店铺里摆列的东西都贴上了名字，真是“教的人随时有机会教，学的人随时有机会学”。
    现在，全县各乡、社都广泛组织读报组、山歌创编组、政治、技术夜校，以满足脱盲群众进一步提高文化的需要。
