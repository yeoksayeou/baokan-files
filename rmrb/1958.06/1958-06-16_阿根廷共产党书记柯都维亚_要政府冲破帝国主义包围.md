Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, June 14th: The Argentine weekly newspaper "Our Word" published a speech by Argentine Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Codovilla at a Buenos Aires party organization meeting.

Analyzing the international and domestic political situation, Codovilla said that recent events show that Latin America "has been included in the great front of people of all countries striving for national and social liberation." The examples of Argentina, Venezuela, and other brotherly countries that have embarked on this path illustrate this point. He said that the people's wishes can be realized on the basis of united workers and a united people.

Speaking about the domestic situation, Codovilla emphasized that "domestic oligarchs and foreign imperialism" oppose the current government of Argentina because this government has created good conditions for the country to develop in the direction of independence and progress.

The government inherited: difficult economic conditions, state institutions filled with enemies of the people, and a system of terror and repression. However, this government has basically restored democratic rights, promulgated amnesty laws, lifted restrictions on political parties and trade unions, and taken a series of measures to stabilize the national economy.

Codovilla pointed out that national wealth must be protected from the plunder of foreign monopoly organizations.

Codovilla called on the government to "break through the imperialist encirclement, expand trade relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China."

Codovilla finally called for support for the new government.

    阿根廷共产党书记柯都维亚
    要政府冲破帝国主义包围
    据新华社15日讯　塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯14日讯：阿根廷“我们的话”周报刊登了阿根廷共产党中央委员会书记柯都维亚在布宜诺斯艾利斯党组织会议上的发言。
    柯都维亚在分析国际局势和国内政治局势时说，最近发生的事件表明，拉丁美洲“列入了争取民族解放和社会解放的各国人民的伟大阵线”。走上了这条道路的阿根廷、委内瑞拉和其他兄弟国家的例子就说明了这点。他说，人民的愿望能够在工人团结一致、人民群众团结一致的基础上得到实现。
    柯都维亚在谈到国内局势时强调指出，“国内的寡头和外国帝国主义”反对阿根廷的现政府，因为这个政府给国家创造了朝独立和进步方向发展的良好条件。
    政府接过来的摊子是：困难的经济条件、充满了人民敌人的国家机构和恐怖的镇压制度。但是，这个政府基本上恢复了民主权利，颁布大赦法、取缔对政党和工会的限制，以及采取了一系列稳定国家经济的措施。
    柯都维亚指出，必须保护国家财富不受外国垄断组织的掠夺。
    柯都维亚呼吁政府“冲破帝国主义包围，同苏联及其他社会主义国家扩大贸易关系，同中华人民共和国建立外交关系”。
    柯都维亚最后号召支持新政府。
