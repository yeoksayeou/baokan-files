Li Xingyong Creates a Dense Planting Ash Applicator

Li Xingyong, the director of the Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has attended provincial labor model conferences and national labor model conferences several times. Recently, due to his achievements in leading the entire agricultural cooperative in technological reform, he was appointed as a member of the Scientific Work Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Committee.

Li Xingyong has a strong sense of responsibility for realizing the production leap forward plan and for the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, he tenaciously studied technological reforms, first successfully creating a dense planting ash applicator, and later successfully trial-producing a double-row cultivator, a three-purpose plow, and a cattle-powered threshing machine.

Li Xingyong is good at relying on and motivating cooperative members to engage in technological innovation together. Encouraged by Li Xingyong, the Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative has already successfully manufactured 27 types of tools, totaling 7,000 pieces. The cooperative members affectionately call Li Xingyong "Living Zhuge Liang."

    李性永创造密植插灰器
    湖南省浏阳县星星农业社主任李性永，曾经几次出席省的劳动模范会议和全国的劳动模范会议。最近由于他在领导全农业社进行技术改革中创造了成绩，被聘为湖南省人民委员会科学工作委员会委员。
    李性永对实现生产跃进计划、对社会主义建设事业有强烈的责任感，所以他在技术改革中顽强地钻研，首先制成功了密植插灰器，以后又试制成功了双耙中耕器、三用犁、牛力打谷机等工具。
    李性永善于依靠和带动社员群众一起搞技术革新。在李性永的鼓舞下，星星农业社全社已经制造成功的工具有二十七种，七千多件。社员们亲切地叫李性永为“活孔明。”
