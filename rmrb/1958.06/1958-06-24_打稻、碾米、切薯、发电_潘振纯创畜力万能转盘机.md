    Pan Zhenchun Creates Animal-Powered Universal Rotary Machine
    Pan Zhenchun, head of the Production Technology Section of the Agricultural Bureau of the Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hunan Province, has successfully created an animal-powered universal rotary machine.

    This type of animal-powered universal rotary machine can be installed anywhere there is oxen power. Each machine requires only three and a half laborers to operate. When driving a rice threshing machine, it can thresh 10,000 jin of rice or slice 20,000 jin of sweet potatoes per day, equivalent to the work efficiency of twenty full laborers for one day. It can also simultaneously drive a DC generator with a capacity of over 1,000 watts, generating enough electricity to power seventy 15-candlepower light bulbs. Secondly, it is mainly made of wood, and the raw materials can generally be sourced locally. The total cost is approximately 150 yuan. The Shaoyang Prefectural Party Committee has decided to promote it throughout the entire region.

    When Pan Zhenchun was helping to run the Chenjiaqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Shaoyang County, he saw that after the great leap forward in agricultural production, the cooperative was short of labor, but the utilization rate of oxen power was very low, as they were idle after plowing the wheat fields. Pan Zhenchun considered using the principle of oxen-drawn waterwheels in the lake area to use oxen power to drive a rice threshing machine to save labor and solve the difficulty of labor shortages during the summer harvest. This idea was immediately supported by carpenter Wang Longshu. They began trial production on May 16th, and after ten days and nights of round-the-clock work, spending forty carpenters, they finally created the animal-powered rice threshing machine on May 25th. Because the animal-powered universal rotary machine drives the rice threshing machine at a high speed, they further considered using the animal-powered universal rotary machine as a power source for electricity generation. In order to obtain the high speed of 1,000 revolutions per minute required for power generation, they also fitted a small gear on the side of the large gear of the universal rotary machine, and installed a three-foot diameter pulley on the other end of the small gear shaft. The pulley drove a small wheel with a diameter of four and a half inches, and the other end of the small wheel shaft was a large wheel with a diameter of three feet. The generator was then driven by a transmission belt through this large wheel, and the power generation test was very successful. It can start a DC generator with a speed of 1,430 revolutions per minute and a power output of 1,300 watts. The generated electricity can supply seventy 15-candlepower light bulbs for lighting. Thus, the animal-powered universal rotary machine has developed into a universal power machine.

### 打稻、碾米、切薯、发电  潘振纯创畜力万能转盘机

    打稻、碾米、切薯、发电
    潘振纯创畜力万能转盘机
    湖南省邵阳专署农业局生产技术科长潘振纯，创制畜力万能转盘机成功。
    这种畜力万能转盘机能在一切有牛力的地方安装，每部只要三个半劳力掌握，带动一部打稻机，每天即可打一万斤稻谷或切两万斤红薯，相当于二十个整劳动力一天的工效。它还可以同时带动一千多瓦的直流发电机，发电量可供七十盏十五支光的电灯照明。其次，主要是用木料造成，原材料一般能就地解决，全部工本费约一百五十元左右。邵阳地委已决定在全区范围内推广。
    潘振纯在邵阳县陈家桥农业社帮助办社，看到农业生产大跃进后，社内劳动力缺乏，但牛力利用率却很低，犁完麦田后就空闲下来了。潘振纯就考虑用湖区牛拉水车原理，利用牛力带动打稻机节省劳力，解决夏收中劳动力缺乏的困难。这个主意当即得到木工王龙书的支持。从5月16日开始试制，经过十天日夜赶制，花了四十个木工，终于在5月25日将畜力打稻机制成。由于畜力万能转盘机带动打稻机的转速快，又使他们进一步考虑到利用畜力万能转盘机作动力发电的问题。为了取得发电所需的每分钟一千转的高速，他们又在万能转盘机大齿盘边套上一个小齿轮，在小齿轮轴的另一端又安装三尺直径的皮带轮，由皮带轮带动直径四点五寸的小轮，小轮轴的另一端是直径三尺的大轮，再通过这个大轮用传动带带动发电机，进行发电试验很成功。它可以发动一部每分钟转速一千四百三十转、发电量一千三百瓦的直流发电机。发出的电力可以供应七十盏十五支光的灯泡照明。至此，畜力万能转盘机就发展成为万能动力机械。
