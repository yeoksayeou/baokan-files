Resolutely Prevent Mosquitoes and Flies from Surviving the Summer
Anhui, Nanjing, and Sichuan Launch Campaigns to Eliminate the Four Pests

    (Our Dispatch) Under the slogan "Resolutely prevent mosquitoes and flies from surviving the summer," Anhui Province is carrying out a patriotic health campaign focused on eliminating mosquitoes and flies and their breeding grounds. According to incomplete statistics from April 7th to May 10th, the province eliminated more than 390,000 jin of flies, more than 48,300 jin of mosquitoes, and dug up more than 2.03 million jin of pupae.

    After the Anhui Province Four Pests Elimination Headquarters issued an "Emergency Notice on Implementing the Elimination of Mosquitoes and Flies" on April 8th, the campaign quickly unfolded throughout the province. Localities not only closely integrated with production, organizing the elderly and children to catch mosquitoes and flies and dig up maggots and pupae, but also collected poisonous wild plants such as rhododendron, cat's eye, and smartweed to kill maggots. Shucheng County, combined with accumulating fertilizer and killing maggots, also made more than 510,000 mosquito nets and more than 760,000 fly swatters for catching flying mosquitoes, mobilizing the county's masses to encircle and suppress mosquitoes and flies. Every dusk, people in every village held nets to catch mosquitoes. Before and after meals or during labor breaks, people with fly swatters catching flies were also seen everywhere. On May 8th, the Kantuan District of Fengtai County mobilized more than 2,000 people to collect more than 20,000 jin of cat's eye in conjunction with weeding, placing them in more than 1,000 manure vats, completely eliminating all the maggots in these manure vats within two days.

    (Our Dispatch) In the summer patriotic health campaign, the people of Nanjing are concentrating on eliminating mosquitoes and flies and strictly controlling mosquito and fly breeding grounds.

    Since the beginning of summer, Nanjing has adopted a combination of focused periodic campaigns and regular management, and a combination of manual capture and drug killing, which has significantly reduced the number of adult mosquitoes and flies compared with previous years, and it is rare to find maggots and larvae in manure vats, toilets, and sewage ditches. So far, the vast majority of areas have not had to hang mosquito nets. The masses reflect that this is a benefit brought about by eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene.

    At present, various districts in Nanjing are continuing to eliminate adult mosquitoes and flies by continuously inspecting and visiting each other, organizing key surprise attacks, and using fly traps, making the work of eliminating the four pests a regular practice. Each district and each department has a clear understanding of every pond and every manure vat in its jurisdiction, and has effectively grasped the breeding and reproduction of mosquito and fly larvae. Each district also organizes Red Cross health workers and mass disinfection workers to be responsible for the regular disinfection of larger sewage ponds and ditches and internal toilets of industrial and mining enterprises. For mosquito and fly breeding grounds scattered in residential areas, general measures are taken to organize joint defense and contract management by area for management and control. Qinhuai District has also established a mosquito and fly breeding control network, adopting a hierarchical responsibility system, with the neighborhood committees responsible to the street offices, and the street offices responsible to the district office, implementing contract management by area throughout the district. Xuanwu, Baixia, Jianye, Xiaguan and other districts have also set up health supervision posts, responsible for the inspection and supervision of environmental sanitation.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu) Sichuan Province is launching a summer campaign to eliminate the four pests, focusing on eliminating mosquitoes and flies. This campaign has already begun in some areas and will be fully launched in various places in June.

    At the end of last month, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of all special districts, cities, and counties in the province, and many regions reported on the elimination of mosquitoes and flies. Luzhou Special District mobilized the masses to investigate and identified 64 kinds of mosquito and fly breeding grounds. The Baihua Agricultural Cooperative in Xuyong County inserted bamboo sticks into the mosquito and fly breeding grounds, contracting them out by area, with dedicated personnel responsible for managing the mosquito and fly breeding bases. This cooperative made a surprise attack for three days and three nights, not only basically eliminating mosquitoes and flies, but also accumulating more than 68,000 jin of fertilizer. Many areas mobilized the masses to widely use wild plants to catch and kill mosquitoes and flies. Xuyong County discovered 143 kinds of wild plants that can kill mosquitoes and flies, and the masses used these wild plants to basically eliminate maggots in all the county's toilets. Many places also carried out large-scale mosquito and fly catching activities. In Jiange County, from the county party secretary to the members of the agricultural cooperatives, everyone held a fly swatter in their hands during work and labor breaks to catch and kill flies.

    At the telephone conference, the Provincial Party Committee also requested that all localities strengthen reporting, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and do their best to combine the elimination of the four pests with production and disease prevention, striving to achieve a new look in the elimination of mosquitoes and flies throughout the province in June. Yan Xiufeng, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made arrangements and mobilization at the telephone conference. He asked all localities to use the spirit of going all out, aiming high, and striving for the upstream, on the basis of the achievements already made, to eliminate the slack mood, continue to work hard, and strive to eliminate the four pests ahead of schedule.

　　坚决不让蚊蝇过夏天
    安徽、南京、四川开展除四害攻势
    本报讯　在“坚决不让蚊蝇过夏天”的口号下，安徽省开展以消灭蚊蝇及其孳生场所为中心的除四害讲卫生运动。据4月7日至5月10日的不完全统计，全省共消灭苍蝇三十九万多斤，蚊子四万八千三百多斤，挖蛹二百零三万多斤。
    安徽省除四害总指挥部于4月8日发出“关于贯彻消灭蚊蝇的紧急通知”后，运动即在全省范围内迅速展开。各地不但紧密结合生产，组织老年人和儿童捕蚊蝇挖蛆灭蛹，而且采集有毒性的闹羊花、猫儿眼、辣蓼子等野生植物灭蛆。舒城县结合积肥灭蛆，又制成捕捉起飞蚊虫用的网兜五十一万多把、蝇拍七十六万多个，发动全县群众向蚊蝇进行围剿。每到黄昏时分，村村有人持着网兜捕捉蚊虫。饭前饭后或劳动休息时间，拿着蝇拍捕捉苍蝇的也到处可见。凤台县阚疃区在5月8日一天，就发动二千多人，结合除草采集猫儿眼二万多斤，放在一千多个粪缸内，两天内就把这些粪缸的蛆全部灭光。
    本报讯　南京市人民在夏季爱国卫生运动中，集中歼灭蚊蝇，严格控制蚊蝇孳生场所。
    入夏以来，南京市采取重点定期突击和经常管理相结合、人工捕打和药物杀灭相结合的办法，使蚊蝇成虫比往年显著减少，粪缸、厕所、污水沟塘内很少发现蛆虫和孑孓。到目前为止，绝大多数地区都还没有挂蚊帐。群众反映说：这是除四害讲卫生带来的好处。
    目前，南京市各个区采取不断检查和相互参观、组织重点突击和使用捕蝇笼等方法继续消灭蚊蝇成虫，把除四害工作经常化。各区各个部门对自己管辖地区的每一个水塘、每一个粪缸，都做到心中有数，切实掌握了蚊蝇幼虫孳生繁殖的情况。各区还组织红十字卫生员和群众消毒员，负责面积较大的污水塘沟和工矿企业单位内部厕所的定期消毒工作。对分散在居民区的蚊蝇孳生地，一般都采取组织联防和分片包干的办法进行管理和控制。秦淮区也建立了控制蚊蝇孳生网，采取分级负责制，居民委员会对街道办事处负责，街道办事处对区办公室负责，全区实行分片包干。玄武、白下、建邺、下关等区，还设置了卫生监督岗，负责环境卫生的检查监督工作。
    据新华社成都讯　四川省正在开展一次以消灭蚊蝇为主的夏季除四害攻势。这次攻势在一些地区已经开始，6月份将在各地全面展开。
    中共四川省委在上月底召开全省各专区、市、县的电话会议，许多地区汇报了消灭蚊蝇的情况。泸州专区发动群众调查，找出了六十四种蚊、蝇孳生场所，叙永县百花农业社把蚊蝇孳生场所用竹签插上，分片包干，专人负责，管理蚊蝇孳生基地。这个社突击三天三夜，不但把蚊、蝇基本消灭，而且积肥六万八千多斤。许多地区发动群众，广泛使用野生植物捕灭蚊、蝇。叙永县发现了一百四十三种能灭蚊、蝇的野生植物，群众利用这些野生植物，使全县厕所已基本达到无蛆。许多地方还对蚊蝇进行了大规模的捕打活动。剑阁县从县委书记至农业社社员，在工作和劳动空隙每人都手拿一蝇拍，进行捕打。
    电话会议上，省委还要求各地加强汇报，及时交流经验，并把除四害尽力作到和生产相结合，和防治疾病相结合，争取6月份在消灭蚊蝇上全省出现一个新的面貌。中共四川省委书记阎秀峰在电话会议上作了布置、动员，他要求各地用鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，在已获得成绩的基础上，去除松劲情绪，再接再厉，争取提前消灭四害。（附图片）
