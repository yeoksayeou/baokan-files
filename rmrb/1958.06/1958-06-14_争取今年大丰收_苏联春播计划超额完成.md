Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th - The Soviet Union's spring planting work has now been victoriously completed nationwide, with the spring planting plan fulfilled by 101%. As of the 10th, collective farms and state farms across the country had sown a total of 126 million hectares of spring crops, more than 800,000 hectares more than in the same period last year. Among them, the sowing plans for major crops such as wheat, cotton, sugar beet, and sunflower have all been overfulfilled.

Due to the cold weather, this year's spring planting work in the Soviet Union started later than last year, but the sowing speed was faster. The reorganization of machine tractor stations played a decisive role in this regard. First, after the reorganization of the machine tractor stations, the station directors and chief engineers took on leadership roles in the collective farms, technicians served as team leaders in the farms' work teams, and 1.5 million machine operators also participated in the work of the collective farms. This greatly strengthened the leadership and technical forces of the collective farms in the spring plowing and sowing work. Secondly, a large number of Party members and members of the Communist Youth League participated in the work of the collective farms, enabling the establishment of Party and League groups in the field work teams, strengthening political and ideological work and organizational work in the spring field work. In addition, the utilization rate of agricultural machinery has also significantly improved. For example, in the Byelorussian Republic, after reorganizing the machine tractor stations and returning the machines to the collective farms, the productivity of each tractor in the republic increased from an average of just over two hectares to three and a half hectares. In the Karaganda Oblast of the Kazakh Republic, the utilization rate of tractors in the collective farms across the state has doubled this year compared to the past. In the spring plowing and sowing, the phenomenon of machine damage and downtime for repairs has been greatly reduced. All of these have greatly accelerated the progress of the Soviet Union's spring planting work this year.

This year, there has been sufficient rainfall in various parts of the Soviet Union, and spring crops are growing well. Winter crops are now universally flowering and heading. It is expected that the Soviet Union will achieve another bumper harvest this year.

    争取今年大丰收
    苏联春播计划超额完成
    新华社莫斯科13日电  今年苏联的春播工作现在已经在全国范围内胜利完成，春播计划完成了101％。到10日为止，全国集体农庄和国营农场总共播种了一亿二千六百万公顷春播作物，比去年同期多八十多万公顷。其中，小麦、棉花、甜菜、向日葵等主要作物的播种计划都是超额完成的。
    由于天气寒冷，今年苏联春播工作比去年开始得迟，但是播种速度却比去年快。机器拖拉机站的改组在这方面起了决定性的促进作用。首先，在机器拖拉机站改组以后，机器拖拉机站的站长和总工程师都担任了集体农庄的领导工作，技术人员担任了农庄的工作队队长，一百五十万机器操使者也参加了集体农庄的工作。这便大大加强了集体农庄在春耕春播工作中的领导力量和技术力量。其次，大批党员和团员参加了集体农庄的工作，使田间工作队也能成立党、团小组，在春季田间工作中加强政治思想工作和组织工作。此外，农业机器的利用率也显著提高了。例如，白俄罗斯共和国在改组机器拖拉机站并把机器归集体农庄以后，全共和国每台拖拉机的生产率就从过去平均耕二公顷多地提高到耕三公顷半地。在哈萨克共和国的卡拉干达州，全州集体农庄的拖拉机的利用率今年比过去提高一倍，在春耕春播中，机器损坏和停工修理的现象大大减少了。这些都大大加速了苏联今年春播工作的进行。
    今年苏联各地雨水充足，春播作物生长良好，冬播作物现在已普遍扬花吐穗。预料今年苏联又将获得丰收。
