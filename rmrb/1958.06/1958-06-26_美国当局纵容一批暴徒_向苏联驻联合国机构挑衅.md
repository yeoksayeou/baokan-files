Xinhua News Agency, June 25th, TASS New York, June 24th: A group of thugs and provocateurs recently conducted hostile demonstrations in front of the building of the Soviet Union's representative institutions to the United Nations.

During the demonstration, the mob surrounded the exit of the building, threatened the staff of the representative institutions, shouted insults against the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's representative institutions to the United Nations, made a ruckus and created disturbances, and distributed vile and inflammatory leaflets.

It has been proven that the provocative demonstration held in front of the building of the Soviet Union's representative institutions to the United Nations was premeditated. In the days before this incident, American newspapers, radio stations, and television stations were publishing inflammatory remarks against the Soviet Union's representative institutions to the United Nations. New York radio stations repeatedly broadcast malicious slanders by participants in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The US authorities were aware that someone was planning this demonstration, but they did not take any measures to prevent such an event. The police station located near the representative institutions actually condoned the provocative behavior of the demonstration participants.

It is worth noting that the US authorities have violated the well-known agreement between the US government and the United Nations on ensuring the normal working conditions of the representative institutions of the United Nations member states, and the US authorities should be directly responsible for the above-mentioned demonstration.

    美国当局纵容一批暴徒
    向苏联驻联合国机构挑衅
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社纽约24日讯：一批暴徒和挑衅者前几天在苏联驻联合国代表机构的大楼前进行了敌意的示威。
    在示威的时候，暴徒包围了大楼的出口，威胁代表机构的工作人员，大喊大叫地侮辱苏联和苏联驻联合国代表机构，进行吵嚷和捣乱并且散发卑鄙的煽动性传单。
    事实证明，在苏联驻联合国代表机构楼前所举行的挑衅性示威是经过事先策划的。在这次事件发生前几天中，美国报刊、电台和电视台就在发表煽动性的言论，反对苏联驻联合国代表机构。纽约电台多次广播了匈牙利反革命叛乱参加者的恶毒谰言。
    美国当局是知道有人在策划这次示威的，但是它并没有采取任何措施来防止这种事件。驻在代表机构附近的警察局实际上纵容了示威参加者的挑衅行为。
    值得注意的是这样一种情况：美国当局破坏了美国政府和联合国之间关于保障联合国会员国代表机构正常工作条件的众所周知的协定，美国当局应当对上述的示威行动直接负责。
