People's Daily, Guangzhou, June 16th: How to implement the "more, faster, better, and more economical" principle in urban construction? Huicheng Town, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has set a good example. Recently, the Urban Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has called on all cities in the country to learn from Huicheng and surpass it!

In recent years, this town has centered on production and developed various urban constructions accordingly. Now, it has basically achieved "five withouts" (no pests and white ants) and "five transformations" (greening, beautification, fragrance, production, and culture), and is leaping forward towards socialist industrialization.

Fully utilizing waste materials and existing buildings to spend less money and accomplish more; spending little money and achieving great things. This is one of the characteristics of urban construction in Huicheng Town. Before liberation, this county town suffered severe damage from the war, with destroyed houses accounting for one-third of the total building area; among the town's more than 27,000 residents, there were more than 8,000 unemployed poor people and laid-off workers. Since liberation, urban construction has been gradually developed on the premise of developing production. Now, Huicheng Town, with a population of more than 34,000, is very beautiful. In addition to newly built and expanded factories and warehouses, a large number of buildings such as the People's Auditorium, People's Hospital, Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Kindergarten, Cultural Palace, and Theater have been built. A large-scale cultural and recreational park has also been built on the wasteland in the north of the town. It includes an exhibition hall, reading room, zoo, swimming pool, pavilion, tea room, and children's playground. Among the nearly 500 buildings belonging to public welfare facilities, more than 100 were built or renovated using existing old buildings. 86% of the building materials used in these new buildings came from cleaning up rubble and demolishing dilapidated walls and houses. Every project is durable, economical, and beautiful. The People's Auditorium, newly built in 1955, can accommodate more than 3,000 people and has a balcony, but it only cost 45,000 yuan; if all new materials were used, the cost would be as high as 250,000 yuan. In 1956, only 12,000 yuan was spent to build a standard swimming pool including advanced, primary, and children's levels, and auxiliary buildings. At normal costs, it would cost at least 100,000 yuan.

Another characteristic of urban construction in Huicheng Town is: combining production with public welfare facilities, accomplishing things without spending money, or spending a little money for profitable gains. Anyone who comes to Huicheng Town will first feel that they have come to a garden city. Trees are planted beside the streets, houses, and small rivers, with greenery everywhere; every household in the streets and alleys plants two pots of flowers at the door, with fragrance everywhere; dozens of dilapidated sites scattered in the town have been cleaned up and planted with trees and flowers. Some even have rockeries and stone benches, which have become public small gardens for the neighborhood. Walking along a road lined with magnolia trees leads to the cultural and recreational park in the north of the town. The landscaping in the park complements the pavilions and towers, making it even more colorful and fresh. Huicheng Town has not spent much money to become so beautiful. On the contrary, it is directly creating wealth for the country. This is to maximize the combination of economic plants and ornamental plants. The park focuses on planting scenic trees and a large number of fruit trees and other ornamental and profitable economic crops. It also cultivates various fragrant flowers that can be made into valuable spices. Therefore, the park invested 20,000 yuan in the four years since its construction, and earned 30,000 yuan last year alone. It is estimated that it will earn 90,000 yuan this year, and the income will be even greater in the future. In the process of implementing comprehensive greening, the urban construction department of Huicheng Town also organized the masses to plant 100,000 banana, papaya, and other early-maturing fruit trees on dilapidated sites and beside houses, which are planted and harvested by the masses themselves.

Another characteristic of urban construction in Huicheng Town is: mobilizing the masses to participate in voluntary labor, and discovering and cultivating technical forces from the masses. In recent years, the party and government leaders of Huicheng Town have been good at using various methods to publicize production construction and urban construction to the masses, so that the party's principles and plans are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; the masses are enthusiastic and energetic about various constructions. Because the masses actively participated in labor, the sewer renovation project, which was originally planned to cost tens of thousands of yuan and take eight years to complete, was completed in a short period of time last winter for 900 yuan. In addition, Huicheng Town originally lacked urban construction technical forces. The leaders discovered technical talents from the masses. The engineer was found from a bookkeeper in a teahouse, the surveyor was found from a school employee, and the technician was recruited from workers who were unemployed before liberation. On the other hand, through practice, masters taught apprentices, and a technical team for urban construction was cultivated.

Now, in order to increase the town's electricity for production and living and to install tap water, people are also building hydropower stations and reservoirs on the hills in the suburbs. (Yang Weiqun, Xu Shi)

    发动群众　结合生产　利用原有建筑
    新会人民多快好省建县城
    本报广州16日电　城市建设如何贯彻“多快好省”的方针？广东省新会县城——会城镇做出了好榜样。最近，中央建筑工程部城市规划局要求全国各城市学习会城，赶过会城！
    几年来，这个城镇以生产为中心，相应地开展各项城市建设。现在，基本实现了“五无”（无四害和白蚁）和“五化”（绿化、美化、香化、生产化、有文化），并向着社会主义工业化跃进。
    充分利用废物旧料和原有建筑，少花钱、多办事；花小钱、办大事。这是会城镇的城市建设工作特点之一。这个县城解放前遭受过战争的严重破坏，被毁坏房屋占总建筑面积三分之一；全镇二万七千多居民中，无业贫民及失业工人即达八千多人，解放以来，在发展生产的前提下，逐步发展了城市建设。现在，拥有三万四千多人口的会城镇，建设得非常美丽，除了新建、扩建了许多工厂和仓库之外，还建设了人民礼堂、人民医院、妇幼保健院、幼儿园、文化宫、戏院等大批的建筑物，在城北废圩荒地上，还建设了一个规模巨大的文化休息公园。里面设置有展览馆、阅览馆、动物园、游泳池、凉亭、茶室和儿童游乐场。所有这些属于公共福利设施的近五百座建筑物中，有一百多座是利用原有的旧建筑物修建、改建的。这些新建筑物所用的建筑材料有86％是从清理瓦砾废圩和拆除危墙、危房得来的。做到每项工程都耐用、经济和美观。1955年新建的可容三千多人的人民礼堂，有楼座，但仅花了四万五千元；如全部用新材料来建筑，造价需二十五万元之巨。1956年也仅花了一万二千元新建一座符合标准的包括高级、初级、儿童级的游泳池和附属建筑物，如按正常造价起码要十万元。
    会城镇的城市建设工作的另一个特点是：结合生产，搞公共福利设施，不花钱，也办事；花点钱，有利收。凡来到会城镇的人都会首先感到来到了一个花园城市，这里的街道旁、住宅旁、小河旁都种植了树，绿荫处处；大街小巷家家户户的门口都栽花两盆，香气阵阵；散布在城镇里的好几十处烂屋场地经过清理之后，也都种树、栽花，有的还摆设假山、砌了石凳，俨然成为街坊的公共小花园。沿着一条两旁尽种着白玉兰树的马路走去，就是在城北的文化休息公园。公园里的园林布置衬托着亭台楼阁，更显得色彩缤纷，气象清新。会城镇能够这样美丽，并未花多少钱，相反的是在直接为国家创造财富。这就是尽量使经济植物与观赏植物相结合。公园里有重点地种植风景树，并大量地种植各种果树和其他的可观赏而又有收入的经济作物。还栽培了各种可制成贵重香料的香花。因此，建园四年来投资二万元，去年一年就收入三万元。今年估计可收入九万元，以后的收入就会更多了。会城镇在实行全面绿化的过程中，城市建设部门还组织群众在烂屋场地和住宅旁种植了十万棵香蕉、木瓜等易熟的果树，由群众自种自收。
    会城镇的城市建设工作还有一个特点是：发动群众参加义务劳动，并从群众中发掘、培养技术力量。几年来，会城镇党政领导善于运用各种方法向群众宣传生产建设，宣传城市建设，从而使党提出的方针、计划深入人心；群众对于各项建设热情高、干劲足。由于群众踊跃参加劳动，原来计划要花几万元为时八年才能完成的下水道整治工程，在去冬短短的时间内用九百元就完成了。此外，会城镇原来缺乏城市建设技术力量，领导门部一方面从群众中发掘技术人才，工程师是从茶楼里的记账员中找来的，测量员是从学校职工中找来的，技工是从在解放前失业的工人中招来的。另方面从实践过程中，师傅带徒弟，培养成了一支城市建设的技术队伍。
    现在，为了使这个城镇能够增加在生产，生活上的用电和设置自来水，人们还在城郊山地上建立水电站和蓄水库。（杨伟群、许实）
