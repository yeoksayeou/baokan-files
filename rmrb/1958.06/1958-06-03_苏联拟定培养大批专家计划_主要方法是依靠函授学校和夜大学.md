Moscow, June 1 (from this newspaper) - The Soviet "Teacher's Newspaper" recently published a report by the Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Yelyutin, at the First Congress of the Trade Union of Workers in Education, Higher Education, and Scientific Institutions of the Soviet Union, regarding the tasks of Soviet institutions of higher education. In his report, Yelyutin said that this year, the Soviet institutions of higher education are training 23 times more specialized personnel than before the revolution. Currently, Soviet institutions of higher education produce 94,000 engineers annually, while the United States produces only 30,000.

The Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, based on the requirements of Soviet economic development, has formulated a plan for training specialized personnel from 1959 to 1965. From 1956 to 1960, institutions of higher education will train 646,000 specialized personnel, and from 1961 to 1965, this will increase to 762,000. The main methods for significantly increasing the training of specialized personnel will rely on correspondence schools and night universities.

Minister Yelyutin emphasized the issue of improving the higher education system in his report. He said that higher education staff suggested that the new higher education system should include the following four methods: a combination of correspondence and full-time study, night school, correspondence, and full-time study. The combination of correspondence and full-time study is structured so that the first and second years are correspondence, and the third and fourth years are full-time study. For example, in training agricultural specialized personnel, all first-year students are assigned to state farms and collective farms for two years of formal work, while also being correspondence students, but without receiving stipends. They receive wages based on their work. After two years, a group of outstanding students is selected based on their performance at work, allowing them to complete the third and fourth years full-time, while the remaining students stay at their jobs and continue correspondence studies or attend night universities. As for the night university education method, it will also be improved in the future, so that students who have completed two years with excellent grades can have their workdays shortened to increase study time. In training specialized personnel in the arts and humanities, students' full-time study will still be preserved, but the teaching system and methods will be changed, and production internships will be extended to one and a half to two years. In addition, regarding the enrollment system for institutions of higher education, the number of new students with more than two years of work experience will be greatly increased in the 1958-1959 academic year.

　　苏联拟定培养大批专家计划
    主要方法是依靠函授学校和夜大学
    本报莫斯科1日电  苏联“教师报”最近发表了苏联高等教育部长叶留金在苏联教育、高等学校和科学机关工作者工会第一次代表大会上作的关于苏联高等学校的任务的报告。叶留金在报告中说，今年苏联高等学校培养出的专门人材比革命前增加二十三倍，目前苏联高等学校一年培养出的工程师有九万四千名，而美国只有三万名。
    苏联高教部根据苏联经济发展的要求，已拟定了1959年至1965年培养专门人材的计划。从1956年到1960年高等学校将培养出六十四万六千名专门人材，而从1961年至1965年将增加到七十六万二千人，大量增加培养专门人材的方法将主要依靠函授学校和夜大学。
    叶留金部长在报告中着重谈了改善高等教育制度的问题。他说，高等学校工作人员建议新的高等教育制度中应包括下列四种方式：函授与脱产学习相结合的方式、夜校、函授和完全脱产学习。函授与脱产学习相结合的方式是这样的，即一二年级是函授，三四年级是脱产学习。例如在培养农业专门人材方面，一年级新生全都分配到国营农场和集体农庄去正式工作两年，同时为函授生，但不发给他们助学金，根据他们的工作发给工资。两年以后根据学生在劳动中的表现选拔一批优秀生让他们脱产念完三四年级，而其他的学生仍然留在工作岗位上继续函授学习或上夜大学。至于夜大学的教育方式，今后也要加以改善，即读完两年的学生，如果成绩优良，可以缩短他们的工作日增加学习时间。在培养艺术和人文科学等方面的专门人材工作中，学生的完全脱产的学习仍然保存，只是教学制度和方法要改变，生产实习要延长至一年半到二年。此外在高等学校招生制度方面，1958—1959学年招收的新生中，具有两年以上工作锻炼的人的名额将大大增加。
