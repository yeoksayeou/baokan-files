    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    67　White Magnolia
    There's nothing new about small white magnolias,
    Their sweet fragrance is comparable to spring orchids.
    The light green leaves always appear fresh and lush,
    Protecting the flowers, fearing they'll needlessly suffer from wind and rain.
    Shanghai girls love to sell them on the streets,
    The sound of their flower selling is truly adorable.
    "White magnolias!" crisper and sweeter than our own fragrance,
    Therefore, it doubles our aromatic charm.
    68　Magnolia
    Stately branches bloom with white lotus-like flowers,
    Their fragrance resembles orchids, so people call them magnolias.
    Jade isn't as pure white and soft as we are,
    But orchids are more fragrant and leisurely than us.
    After flowering, the petals can be dredged in flour and fried,
    Ornamental and economic uses combine beautifully.
    Please use chemical methods to analyze or extract,
    It is said the fruit and buds can also relieve heat and induce sweating.
    69　Magnolia denudata
    The name "Magnolia denudata" is more poetic than "辛夷" (another name for it),
    We want to use the blue sky as a blank sheet of paper,
    Dipping our brush in purple ink, to write new poems on it;
    Who is soaking a large brush, so dripping and freely?
    The poems are written, but the poets can't see the words,
    They still treat the blue sky as a blank tablet.
    Who understands this new poem?
    It is the farmers, the learned masters, who soak the large brush.
    70　Big Mountain Magnolia
    Our flowers are a little bigger than those of the magnolia officinalis,
    People also call us lotus magnolias.
    The leaf shape is between that of the loquat and the oak,
    With twelve petals, truly like large white lotuses.
    The strong fragrance can travel far on the wind,
    The purple stamens let Guanyin sit on a cattail cushion.
    Our flowering period, although inevitably short,
    But our branches and trunks have the energy to soar to the sky.
    71　Trumpet Vine
    People call us Trumpet Vine, a bit of an exaggeration,
    We climb upwards winding around large trees on the southern branches.
    Writing it as "陵苕" (another name for it) seems a bit better,
    The "凌霄" ("towering into the sky" implied by the name "Trumpet Vine") isn't us, it's our host.
    The big tree is selfless, standing tall and reaching the sky;
    Carrying the weak upwards, without the slightest complaint.
    Adorning it with red flowers,
    We are forming a solid united front.
    72　Wisteria
    People love to train us on wooden frames,
    Letting our flowers bloom from late spring to early summer.
    The inflorescence is very long, sometimes up to six feet; (Note)
    The branches and leaves are lush, with purple clouds hanging down under the green canopy.
    Thousand-year-old trees only have withered and forked branches,
    In the Palace of Labor, many withered trees are blooming.
    That's because we are using the withered trees as our backbone,
    People then endow them with new life, a work equal to creation.
    (Note) See the "Plant Encyclopedia" by Japanese scholar Mikio Murakoshi, which states the larger ones can grow to two meters.
    73　Black Locust
    Wisteria originally has a white-flowered variety,
    We and the wisteria are truly brothers.
    The flower shape and leaf shape are completely similar,
    Only the difference between vine and tree.
    Please plant wisteria and us together,
    Let us embrace and improve together.
    You will see the unity of opposites,
    Purple and white flowers fluttering on the same tree.

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    67　白兰花
    小白兰花倒没有什么新奇，
    清甜的香韵可和春兰相比。
    淡青色的叶子经常显得鲜腻，
    护惜着花朵怕无端受了风雨。
    上海姑娘们喜欢在街头叫卖，
    那卖花的声音真是十分可爱。
    “白兰花呢！”清脆得比我们香甜，
    因此，使我们的香韵添了一倍。
    68　玉兰
    亭亭挺立的枝头开出朵朵白莲，
    有香类似兰蕙被人们称为玉兰。
    玉没有我们这样的纯白而柔软，
    兰却比我们要更加馥郁而悠闲。
    花开后，花瓣可以拖面粉而油煎，
    观赏植物与经济植物其美两全。
    请用化学方法来分析或者提炼，
    据说果实和芽还可以解热、发汗
    69　木笔
    木笔的称呼比辛夷更有诗意，
    我们要把青天当作一张白纸，
    蘸足紫墨水，好向纸上写新诗；
    问谁在濡染大笔这样地淋漓？
    诗写好了，诗人们却看不见字，
    他们依然把青天当成没字碑。
    懂得这首新诗的，究竟有谁呢？
    就是那濡染大笔的农民夫子。
    70　大山朴
    我们的花比厚朴花要大得一点，
    人们又把我们称呼为荷花玉兰。
    叶形在枇杷和橡树叶的中间，
    花瓣十二片，真像朵朵大白莲。
    浓重的香气因风可传达很远，
    紫色的雄蕊让观音坐着蒲团。
    我们的花期，为时虽不免过短，
    但我们的枝干，却有干劲冲天。
    71　凌霄花
    人们叫我们是凌霄，有点夸大，
    我们是蟠着大树的南枝往上爬。
    写成“陵苕”看来是要好得一点，
    凌霄的不是我们，是我们的东家。
    大树是大公无私，亭亭立地参天；
    携带着弱者向上，没有丝毫怨言。
    在大树上替他簪上了朵朵红花，
    咱们是形成着牢固的统一战线。
    72　朱藤
    人们最喜欢把我们蟠上木架，
    让我们的花由暮春开得初夏。
    花序很长，有时可以长到六尺；（注）
    枝叶繁茂，翠盖下倒垂着紫霞。
    千年的古木只剩着枯干杈枒，
    在劳动宫里不少的枯树开花。
    那就是让我们以枯树为骨干，
    人们便赋予以新生，功同造化。
    （注）见日本人村越三千男著“植物大图鉴”，言大者可长至二公尺。
    73　洋槐
    朱藤原来有开白花的一种，
    我们和朱藤真正就是弟兄。
    花形和叶形都是完全相似，
    就只有藤本和木本一点不同。
    请把朱藤和我们种在一道，
    让我们能拥抱着一同提高。
    你们就会看到矛盾的统一，
    紫花和白花同在一树飘摇。
