Changchun, June 17th (This newspaper dispatch) Jilin Province, based on its climate characteristics, has decided to launch an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy construction upsurge during this year's slack weeding season. Through this upsurge, the province's water conservancy landscape will undergo even greater changes.

Jilin Province is vast and sparsely populated, with a rural population of only about eight million. However, during the water conservancy construction upsurge last winter and this spring, more than one million people were mobilized across the province every day to fight against blizzards and frozen soil day and night in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. In five months, more than 300 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed, expanding the irrigated area by more than 10 million mu, averaging more than one mu per person. More than 70% of these projects will be effective this year. However, the cold period in Jilin Province lasts for more than five months, and the temperature is often around minus 30 degrees Celsius (including part of the spring). Although the enthusiasm of the masses has largely overcome the severe cold, labor efficiency is limited to a certain extent. Therefore, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that, based on the province's conditions, in addition to continuing to adhere to winter construction in the future, it is necessary to seize the favorable opportunity of the autumn field slack season to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction in order to accelerate the progress of water conservancy in the province.

The slack season in Jilin Province (that is, the agricultural off-season after the summer weeding ends and before the autumn harvest begins) is generally around July 20th to September 20th. During this period, the days are long and the nights are short, the climate is mild, and it is easy to work in the water. At the same time, it is also the flood season, and the masses already have the habit and experience of flood prevention and control, so they can mobilize more people to launch a new upsurge in water conservancy construction.

At present, all localities are actively preparing for the water conservancy construction upsurge after the slack season. In early May, the five counties of Panshi, Shuangyang, Yongji, Jiutai, and Dehui in the Yinma River basin formulated an agreement to completely control the Yinma River within one or two years. Changling, Nongan, and Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County jointly formulated an agreement to control waterlogging in the three counties. Yitong County mobilized the entire county for large-scale collaboration and support, and established a year-round construction team of more than 10,000 people, preparing to build five medium-sized reservoirs with more than 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork during the slack season to eliminate the threat of the Yitong River flood to the county and downstream areas.

The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch a water conservancy construction upsurge involving more than two million people across the province during this year's slack season. During this upsurge, the province will expand the irrigated area by 300,000 to 500,000 hectares (including 200,000 hectares of paddy fields), completely control the existing waterlogged areas (200,000 hectares), newly build and reinforce the dikes of the Songhua River, Nen River and other rivers, complete 800,000 hectares of soil and water conservation area, build 150 hydropower stations (generating 5,000 kilowatts), and repair existing water conservancy projects, totaling about 390 million cubic meters of earthwork. After this upsurge, the most harmful waterlogging disasters in the province will be basically eliminated, so that a rainfall of 150 mm will not cause disasters, and a bumper harvest can be guaranteed even in the event of extraordinary floods; the irrigated area will reach 1.3 million hectares; and the soil and water conservation area will reach 20,000 square kilometers.

    根据气候特点　利用挂锄空隙
    吉林组织大规模水利建设高潮
    本报长春17日电　吉林省根据本省气候特点，决定在今年挂锄季节掀起一个空前规模的水利建设高潮。通过这个高潮，全省水利面貌将更大的改观。
    吉林省地广人稀，农村人口仅八百万左右。但去冬今春水利建设高潮中，全省每天出动一百多万人在零下三十度的严寒中，日夜同狂风大雪、冻土坚冰作战。五个月内兴修水利达三亿多土方，扩大灌溉面积一千多万亩，平均每人达一亩以上。其中70％以上的工程在今年发挥效益。但是，吉林省寒冷时间长达五个多月，气温经常在摄氏零下三十度左右（包括一部分春季时间）。尽管群众的干劲在很大的程度上战胜了严寒，但劳动效率受到一定限制。因此，中共吉林省委认为：根据本省条件，今后除继续坚持冬季施工以外，必须抓住秋田挂锄的有利时机，大规模地进行水利建设，以加速全省水利化的进度。
    吉林省挂锄期间（即夏锄结束、秋收尚未开始的农闲季节），一般在7月20日至9月20日左右。这段期间日长夜短，气候温和，便于水中作业。同时又是汛期，群众已有防汛治水的习惯和经验，故能发动更多的人员，掀起新的水利建设高潮。
    目前各地都在积极为挂锄后的水利建设高潮进行准备。5月初，饮马河流域的磐石、双阳、永吉、九台、德惠等五县，制定了一、二年内根治饮马河的协议书。长岭、农安和前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县，共同制定了治理三县内涝的协议。伊通县发动全县大协作大支援，建立了一万多人的常年施工队，准备在挂锄期间修建五个十万土方以上的中型水库，以解除伊通河洪水对本县及下游的威胁。
    中共吉林省委决定今年挂锄季节，在全省掀起一个二百多万人参加的水利建设高潮。这个高潮中，全省将扩大灌溉面积三十至五十万公顷（其中水田二十万公顷），治完现有的涝洼地（二十万公顷），新修和加固松花江、嫩江和其他江河堤防，完成水土保持面积八十万公顷，修建水电站一百五十处（发电五千瓩），补修已有各项水利工程等共计约有三亿九千万土方。经过这个高潮，对全省为害最大的内涝灾害将基本解除，能作到一次降雨一百五十公厘不成灾，遇到特大洪水也能保证丰收；灌溉面积达到一百三十万公顷；水土保持面积达到两万平方公里。
