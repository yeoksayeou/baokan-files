    I am resolutely of one heart with the Party
    Hua Luogeng
    My Past Views on the Party
    Before examining this aspect of the issue, I had some resistance in my emotions: I mistakenly thought that eight years ago, while most people were still watching and waiting, I had already decided to return from the United States, which was a sign that I was wholeheartedly following the Communist Party. Why would there still be a question of whether I was of one heart with the Party? After sleepless nights, I saw things more clearly and began to realize that even following the Party does not prove that one is of one heart, especially now that our country has entered a socialist society. – Seagulls follow seagoing ships, not because they have the same destination as the ships, but because they can get food from them. The ancients said: "Of one heart and one virtue." If I retain bourgeois ideology, of course, my standard of virtue will be completely different from the socialist standard. If we don't share the same virtue, of course, we won't share the same heart. Therefore, a person like me, filled with bourgeois individualism, will never be of one heart and one virtue with the Communist Party, and will never be of one heart and one virtue with the proletariat. So, not being of one heart is a natural conclusion.
    The Three-Anti and Ideological Remolding Movements were, for me, a total exposure of my thinking. It exposed that I was not a fellow traveler, but a traveler on a different path. Looking at it from today's perspective, it would not be an exaggeration to say that I had anti-Party sentiments at that time. It was extremely dangerous. I thank the Party for not considering me unteachable, and for proactively helping me in a timely manner, patiently waiting for my awakening, waiting for my repentance. This is something that anyone with a conscience would be moved by. Looking at it from the other side, it becomes even clearer that if I had been left to my own devices and allowed to develop along that path, the consequences would have been unimaginable. I would have either embarked on a path of betrayal, becoming a traitor who deserted the motherland, or I would have become an anti-Party rightist. When I thought about this late at night, I couldn't sleep peacefully. I sincerely thank the Party for saving my life, for saving my political life.
    This is my current state of mind. Looking back on those days, it feels like a different world. But the thoughts that I find frightening today were the very thoughts that were most deeply imprinted on my mind back then. After the Three-Anti and Ideological Remolding Movements, I mistook everyone's good intentions for malice, took exposure as slander, and criticism as attack. I suspected this and suspected that, suspecting that someone was using the movement to attack and retaliate against me. In short, I was looking for the shortcomings and deviations in the movement, instead of positively assessing the meaning and role of the movement, especially its educational significance for me personally.
    My attitude towards some cadres during the Three-Anti Movement best illustrates this phenomenon. When I saw them, I felt my heart constricting and my emotions were antagonistic. I didn't see them as doctors led by the Party to cure my illness, but instead as people who were adding to my illness. This lack of gratitude lasted for a long time, and even when I knew it was wrong and should be overcome, it still occasionally surfaced.
    Before the Three-Anti and Ideological Remolding Movements, I complained that the Party organizations at Tsinghua University and the Academy of Sciences did not recognize my academic achievements. For a short period after the Three-Anti and Ideological Remolding Movements, I mistakenly thought that they shouldn't have estimated my political level so low. I didn't understand that the Party's criticism and education were precisely the Party's love and attention for me. It wasn't until the spring of 1953, when I participated in the Chinese Academy of Sciences' delegation to the Soviet Union, and learned during the visit that the Soviet Union had asked the Chinese government for its opinion on whether to award me the Stalin Prize, and that the Chinese government had immediately agreed (later, the academic prize was discontinued due to Stalin's death), and had telegraphed me to return to China to work on the Chinese version of "Additive Prime Number Theory," that I was deeply grateful. I realized that my suspicions were all wrong. And when I thought about the concern shown to me in the process of persuading me to return to China, I realized that the Party had been concerned about and understood me long before I returned to China. It was just that my bourgeois ideology had blinded me and made me confused.
    After learning that the Party completely trusted me, another side effect appeared: I became even more arrogant and self-important. I held my tail high, higher and higher. I must have been one of those people whom Chairman Mao mentioned as holding their tails ten thousand meters high. I became even more arrogant and conceited in my scholarship, with no one in my eyes. I also felt that I was very progressive politically. This emotion turned me into a person without self-awareness. Recently, when I talked about these empty baggage and smelly baggage, my daughter said very accurately: "Everyone can see your empty baggage and smelly baggage, except you yourself." When it came to academic awards, I felt that I "should not give way to others" and refused to withdraw, which caused a lot of difficulties. This was all because my tail was held too high, unable to come down, and my airs were too great, unable to be humbled. In essence, after 1953, I embarked on a situation of "spoiled and arrogant."
    This "spoiling" hindered my progress, made me look down on everything, filled me with arrogance, and made me unable to tolerate or unite with others. It also made me feel that my abilities were extraordinary, and that I could easily and mistakenly believe that I had the ability to combine politics and professional work very well, and that I could handle a lot of work in both aspects. However, this movement completely exposed this false phenomenon of mine. As my comrades said, my definitions of "red" and "expert" were still vague. My so-called politics was just attending a lot of meetings and writing some articles of poor quality; my so-called expertise was just doing some academic papers, and even those were not serious enough. In short, I was "not red" and my "expertise" was about to collapse. I am grateful for this movement, which made me realize my fatal flaws, and made me deeply realize the unbreakable truth that Chairman Mao said: "Modesty helps one to advance, while conceit makes one lag behind." I have fallen behind too severely. I must catch up quickly and strive to be upstream.
    When I think of the Party's care for me, when I think of how I have let the Party down, when I think of how I regarded the Party's education as a lack of understanding of me, when I think of how I turned the Party's attention into arrogance, my mood is heavy. In the future, I can only embody the Party's intentions in my work at all times, do the work assigned to me by the Party more wholeheartedly, muster up energy, strive to be upstream, resolutely be of one heart with the Party, and move forward, forward, desperately forward.

    To Better Learn the Party's Guidelines and Policies, and Never Again Put Self-Interest Before the Public Good
    Now I will examine another aspect. I will use only one example as typical to illustrate. I once said: "Mathematical problems are the easiest to distinguish right from wrong. If we cannot even conduct discussions in mathematics and cannot bring ourselves to criticize, how can we hope to conduct mutual criticism in life?" This statement, on the one hand, was to elevate myself and find a theoretical basis for my incessant questioning in discussion groups. On the other hand, it was also a kind of veiled threat and attack on some discussion groups that had fewer discussions. Even more frightening, it implied that political progress could be seen from this.
    Did I really elevate the debates in the discussion groups to a theoretical level? In reality, it was completely out of the question. The most concrete example to illustrate my view is still my own words. I said: "Even an individualist should welcome academic criticism, because the earlier the mistakes are found, the smaller the scope of embarrassment will be. If it is found in our discussion group, isn't it just us who know about it? If it is discovered after it is published in the mathematical journal, the embarrassment will be even greater." This is an extremely vulgarized statement of criticism and self-criticism, but it is precisely what I have in my heart. My so-called academic criticism is merely hoping that everyone will point out mistakes more often, so as to avoid embarrassment on a larger scale. My request, sometimes close to forcing people, to give opinions on "Introduction to Number Theory" was all based on this personal calculation. I also once said, "I will not guide research for those who refuse to give me opinions." Looking back on it today, the synonym for this sentence should be "You don't give me benefits, and I won't give you benefits." This is truly a deal where money is exchanged for goods.
    Even this individualistic form of "criticism" has not been well implemented. When errors were found in articles or manuscripts, instead of blaming myself, I always blamed the people who had read them for being irresponsible and careless. On the other hand, when others found errors, I sometimes did not humbly listen, sometimes I would get angry, and sometimes I would even stubbornly believe that people did not understand. So it is really not easy to be my assistant or student. It is not okay not to offer opinions, but offering opinions will lead to setbacks and unreasonable scolding. Almost everyone who has worked with me, whether before or after liberation, has had this experience.
    There are countless examples of such things that mix personal purposes and distort and utilize major principles and guidelines. Since the Party's guidelines and policies and major principles can be mixed with personal factors and distorted and utilized, this fully shows that my relationship with the Party is very abnormal. Some people say that I have a patriarchal style, and some people say that I am like an honorary director. Both of these statements are correct, depending on the occasion. As an individualist, the law of things is: be active if it is beneficial to me, be passive if it is not beneficial to me; want a high position, fear responsibility, hate that there is too little praise, and fear that there is too much criticism.
    In the future, I must better study and understand the Party's guidelines and policies, guarantee that I will never put self-interest before the public good, and take the interests of the Party and the interests of the people as the premise, so as to dedicate everything to the Party, including knowledge, strength, and life.

    We Can No Longer Treat Research Work with "I" as the Center
    The opinions given to me by the comrades at Peking University have also given me great inspiration. I really put "I," "what I am researching," and "the group I lead" at the very center.
    First, let's talk about research work. My view on research work is not entirely correct. I am now going to expose the dark side. Research work is the capital that I started with. My social status is inseparable from my continuous engagement in research work. Since it is the capital that I started with, of course, I strive for more, strive for excellence, and strive for "more, faster, better, and more economical" for me personally. My consistent understanding of scientific research is: producing results is a sign of my fame in the world and my legacy for future generations; only research work belongs to me. These decadent thoughts are deeply rooted in my mind. After liberation, although some changes have been made on the branches, these decadent and ugly essences still exist objectively and are revealed from time to time, thus poisoning the young comrades of the Institute of Mathematics and bringing undue pressure on papers and business pressure to all the comrades in the Institute.
    The above is my view on research work, which is completely based on the individual. Under this situation, I also take this as the core and arrange other work around it. I don't want to deny the three steps I have taken in training young people in recent years: first, to write a book that can enable young people to follow it to conduct research in a certain branch; in the process of writing the book, some young people can learn and exercise; second, to help young people compile some special materials under a theme. When compiling materials, they can recognize those primary and secondary. Printing out the materials can make it easier for others to master this field; third, to further embark on the road of research. Whether this method is correct or not can be discussed, but when I implement it, it reveals the way of carrying out under the control of bourgeois ideology. The first step becomes organizing some people to help me write a book, from which I personally gain fame and fortune. The second step becomes me helping others, so that they gain fame and fortune, and they inevitably mention me in the materials. No matter how well the two steps are done, one thing is certain, that is, everyone is infected with the bourgeois idea of seeking fame and fortune. Entering the third step, they become even more arrogant, invincible so-called talents full of bourgeois thoughts. This is a portrayal of my three steps. Rather than saying that I care about number theory algebra groups, it is better to say that I care more about writing an "Introduction to Number Theory" and writing a "Typical Group Theory"; rather than saying that I care about the training of young people, it is better to say that I care more about everyone giving me more opinions so that I can write the book better.
    Under such ideological guidance, of course, I also care less about the work of other groups in the institute. The differential equation group and the probability theory and mathematical statistics group are the key points, but my concern for them is far from enough. I have some opinions on both ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations, but I always excuse myself as a layman, and I don't want to improve myself through conversation, and at the same time, I may be able to remind others. Needless to say, mathematical logic, topology, and functional analysis are not put in my regular consideration. It was not until shortly before I engaged in scientific planning in 1953 that I paid attention to mathematical logic because it was related to electronic computers.
    My conservative thinking is inseparable from my insufficient loyalty to the people's cause and my decline in scientific research work. I only read about ten or twenty new articles every year, my level of academic thinking stagnated in the 1930s and 1940s, and my previous general understanding of mathematics has not been well-attended to, only hearing one or two sentences through hearsay. At the same time, I am also a person who does not pay attention to theoretical learning, so of course I cannot meet today's requirements, especially showing that it is not commensurate with the responsibilities I bear today. As for the development of the mathematical cause on a national scale, I have not paid enough attention to it. If I occasionally pay attention to it, it is only a few times of skimming the surface. This is of course greatly unable to meet the objective requirements. In the future, I must better pay more attention to the development of mathematics across the country through the scientific planning group and the Mathematical Society, and do everything possible to carry out all work on the basis of collective leadership.

    Favoring the Old and Disparaging the New, Favoring Oneself and Disparaging Others, is the Root Cause of Disunity
    Generally speaking, I have shown conservative thinking in learning that favors the old and disparages the new, and I have shown individualistic thinking in all my work that favors myself and disparages others.
    This kind of thinking of favoring oneself and disparaging others is more clearly manifested in lifestyle. The problems that I am engaged in are important, and the problems that others are engaged in, unless they are particularly important and I have nothing to say, it is difficult to get my praise. The basis for distinguishing between myself and others is like this, and the basis for distinguishing between my own students and non-my own students is also like this, the basis for distinguishing between the branches I specialize in and the branches I do not specialize in is also like this, and the basis for distinguishing between inside and outside the institute is also like this.
    Comrades who have worked with me for a long time must have heard me often say: "My requirements for internal are strict, and at the same time, I am not unaware of the national level and the world level. When it comes to external, I will make an appropriate and objective assessment." What is the meaning of this sentence? That is, don't be unhappy because I have been strict with you or criticized you. When it comes to external, I will brag about you. In fact, I did so. This kind of boasting has created a wrong trend, a trend of only "expertise" but not "red", and a trend of undue business pressure.
    This kind of favoring oneself and disparaging others is the root cause of disunity. As far as my current position is concerned, I should bear the greatest responsibility for the disunity in the mathematics community. What grieves me the most is that I had no previous grudges with many people in the mathematics community before liberation. The people who had grudges after liberation have all improved, but on the contrary, I have created disunity with many people. Isn't this enough to show how much responsibility I should bear and how much loss it has brought to the people?
    Conceit is the internal factor that prevents me from uniting with people. I can't see the advantages of others and my own shortcomings. I always emphasize the shortcomings of others, which makes me complacent, makes me unable to learn from others well, and makes me unable to unite with people. If I consider more from the cause of the people, I will feel that it is not enough to meet the needs of the country to unite all the only a few old mathematicians. If I think more about the advantages of my comrades and learn from them, I will love my comrades more and unite closely. At the same time as I wrote the self-criticism draft, I also wrote down the advantages of those comrades who had disagreements with me. I must dig out the old roots that cause disunity from the bottom of my heart, unite with my comrades, and move forward together.
    Thank you to the rectification movement for letting us settle old scores. On the new ideological basis, on the basis of jointly conducting collective leadership of mathematics, we criticize each other, unite each other, learn from each other, care for each other, and move forward vigorously. At the same time, I also hope that the masses will supervise us and help us. Especially me, if I sometimes talk nonsense behind my back, please give me an unceremonious head-on blow.

    My Aspiration
    I am determined to be an intellectual of the working class, I am determined to be both red and expert, I am determined to demand myself according to the standards of a Communist Party member, I am determined to strive to join the great Chinese Communist Party and be a soldier in the vanguard of the proletariat.

    我坚决和党一条心
    华罗庚
    过去对党的看法
    在检查这方面问题之前，我的情绪上是有过抵触的：谬以为八年之前，一般人还在观望，而我就决心从美国回来，就是一心一意跟共产党走的表示。为什么还会有和党是不是一条心的问题？经过了不眠的夜晚，我才看清楚了一些，才开始认识即使是跟了党走，也不能证明就是一条心，特别是在我国已经进入到社会主义社会的今天。——鸥鸟跟随了海船走，并不是由于它和海船有相同的目的地，而是从海船上可以获得一些食物。古人说：同心同德。我如果保留着资产阶级思想，当然就和社会主义之德的标准完全不同。既不同德，当然也就不会同心。所以我这个充满了资产阶级个人主义思想的人，决不会和共产党同心同德的，决不会和无产阶级同心同德的，所以不同心是自然的结论。
    三反、思想改造运动对我说来，是我的思想的一次总暴露。那就暴露了我并不是同路人，而是异路人。如果提到今天的水平来看，说我那时有反党情绪也不为过。危险极了。感谢党，不是认为我不可教，并且及时地主动地对我进行帮助，耐心地等待我的觉悟，等待我的悔改。这是任何一个有良心的人都不会不感动的。反过来看，就更加清楚了，如果听任自流，让我发展下去，其后果是不堪设想的，我不是走上脱离祖国成为叛徒的绝路，便会成为一个反党的右派分子。我深夜扪心想到这儿的时候，睡不安席。我衷心地感谢党，感谢党救了我的命，挽救了我的政治生命。
    这是我今天的思想情况，回想当年，真有隔世之感了。可是今天我认为可怕的思想，正是当年印在我心上印得最深的思想。在三反、思想改造运动以后，我把大家的好意当成恶意，把揭发当成诽谤，把批评当成攻击，怀疑这，怀疑那，怀疑有人借运动对我攻击报复。总的一句话，我是在找运动中的缺点和偏差，而不从正面来估计运动的意义和作用，特别是对我个人的教育意义。
    我对待三反运动时一些干部的态度最可以说明这一现象。在我见到他们的时候，就觉得心在收缩，情绪对立。不把他们看成为党所领导的给我治病的医生，相反地把他们看成给我添病的人。这不识好歹的情绪延长得很久，即使当自己知道不好，应当克服的时候，还是不时流露。
    三反、思想改造运动以前，我抱怨过清华大学、科学院的党组织在学术上不认识我。三反、思想改造运动以后的不长一段时间内，我又谬认为他们不该在政治上把我估计得这样低。我不了解党的批评和教育正是党对我的爱护和重视。直到1953年的春天，我参加了中国科学院的访苏代表团，并且在访苏期间，知道了苏联向中国政府征求意见，是否同意给我斯大林奖金，而中国政府立刻同意（后来因斯大林去世，学术奖金停发），并且电调我回国搞“堆垒素数论”中文版。这时候我感激得很，我觉悟到我的怀疑都是错了；并且联想到在争取我回国过程中对我的关怀，转而认识早在我回国之前党就关心和了解我了，只是我的资产阶级思想蒙蔽了我，使我自己糊涂起来而已。
    在知道了党完全信任了我以后，另外一个副作用又出现了：我越发地趾高气扬了，越发地自高自大了。我的尾巴翘得很高，越翘越高。毛主席所说的把尾巴翘到了一万公尺高的人，其中有一个一定是我。学问上更自高自大，目中无人。政治上也觉得自己很进步了。这种情绪使我变为毫无自知的人。在最近我谈到这些空包袱臭包袱的时候，我女儿很确切地说：“你那个空包袱臭包袱谁都看得出，就是你自己瞒了你自己。”在学术评奖的时候，我觉得“当仁不让”，不肯撤出，造成了不少困难。这都是尾巴翘得太高，放不下来，架子摆得太大，小不下来的缘故。实质上，1953年以后，我走上了“恃宠而骄”的情况了。
    这种“骄纵”阻碍了我的进步，使我眼高于顶，气溢于胸，目中无人，因此不能容人，不能团结人；也使我觉得我的能力了不得，遇事轻易，谬以为我有能力，可以把政治和业务结合得很好，两方面我都能够担任很多的工作。但是，这次运动把我这一虚假现象完全拆穿了。诚如同志们所说的，我对“红”与“专”的定义都还是模模糊糊的。所谓政治仅是出席了很多的会，写了些质量不高的文章；所谓业务只不过做了些学术论文，并且是不够严肃的。总的一句话：“红”谈不上，“专”快垮了。感谢这次运动，使我认识了我这致命的缺点，使我深刻认识到毛主席所说的颠扑不破的真理：虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。我落后得实在太厉害了。我要急起直追，力争上游。
    在我想到党对我的爱护的时候，在我想到我辜负了党的时候，在想到我把党对我的教育看为不了解我的时候，在我想到我把党的重视化为骄傲的时候，我的心情是沉重的。今后唯有在工作中时刻体现党的意图，更全心全意地做好党所交给我的工作，鼓起干劲，力争上游，坚决和党一心，向前向前，拚命地向前。
    要更好地学习党的方针政策，决不再以私害公
    现在我再检查另一方面。我现在只用一个例子作为典型加以说明。我曾经说过：“数学问题是最容易辨别是非的，如果在数学上还不能展开讨论，拉不下面皮进行批评，我们还能希望在生活中进行互相批评吗？”这句话一方面是抬高自己，为我在讨论班中的滔滔发问、不问垮不止的情况找理论根据；另一方面，也是对一些讨论较少的讨论班进行一种侧面的威胁和打击。更可怕的是，影射着由这一点可以看出政治上的进步不进步。
    我真的把讨论班中的争辩提到理论高度了吗？实际上是完全谈不到的。说明我的看法的最具体的例子还是我自己的话，我说过：“就是个人主义者也应当欢迎人家对我进行学术上的批评，因为错误找出来得早，出丑的范围也就比较小。如果在我们的讨论班上找出来，知道的还不仅仅是我们这些人吗？如果登到数学学报上才发现错了，丑就出得更大了”。这是把批评和自我批评极端庸俗化了的说法，但这正是我心底里的话。我所谓的学术上的批评，仅仅是希望大家多指出错误，免得在更大的范围内出丑而已。我要求人家、有时候接近于逼迫人家对“数论导引”提意见，都是由这种个人打算出发的。我也曾经说过“对不肯给我提意见的人，我不指导他做研究”。今天检查起来，这句话的同义语应当是“你不给我好处，我也不给你好处”。这真是一手交钱一手交货的买卖。
    就是这样的个人主义形式的“批评”也是没有很好地贯彻过。文章中或手稿中发现了错误，不是自己责备自己，反而总是责备帮我看过的人，责备旁人不负责、不小心。另一方面，在旁人找到了错误的时候，有时并不虚心听取，有时还要发脾气，甚至于有时刚愎自用认为人家看不懂。所以做我的助手或学生实在不容易。不提意见不行，提了意见又要碰钉子，无理地挨骂。差不多所有和我共同工作过的人，无论是解放前还是解放后，都是有过这种经验的。
    这种夹杂了个人目的，歪曲利用大原则和方针政策的事是举不胜举的。对于党的方针政策和大原则，既然可以夹杂了个人因素而予以歪曲利用，这也就充分说明了我和党的关系很不正常了。有人说我有家长作风，也有人说我像名誉所长，这两种说法都对，就是看在什么场合出现。作为一个个人主义者对事物的规律是：对自己有利的就积极，对自己无利的就消极；高位要座，责任怕负，表扬恨少，批评怕多。
    我今后一定要更好地学习和体会党的方针政策，保证决不以私害公，一切以党的利益、人民的利益为前提，做到把一切献给党，包括知识、力量和生命。
    不能再以“我”为中心来对待研究工作
    北京大学的同志们给我提的意见，也给了我很大的启发。我的确是把“我”，“我所研究的”，“我所领导的组”放在最中心。
    先谈研究工作。我对研究工作的看法是不完全正确的，我现在来揭露出黑暗的一面。研究工作是我起家的本钱，我之所以有社会地位是和我不间断地从事研究工作分不开的。既然它是起家的本钱，当然也就力求其多，力求其精，力求其对我个人来说的“多快好省”。我对科学研究一向的认识是：搞出结果来是我扬名于世界、垂名于后世的标志，只有研究工作才是我的。这些腐朽思想在我脑海中根深蒂固。解放后，在枝节上虽然改了一些，但是这些腐朽的丑恶的本质还是客观地存在着，并且不时地流露出来，因而毒害了数学研究所的年青同志，并且给全所的同志带来了不正当的论文压力和业务压力。
    以上是我对研究工作的看法，是完全由个人出发的看法。在这种情况之下，也就以此为核心，围绕着它来安排其它工作。我并不想否定我这几年来所进行的训练青年的三个步骤：第一，写一本可以使青年们循此进行某一分支研究的书，在写书的过程中可以使一些青年学习和锻炼；第二，帮助青年在一个主题之下，搞些专题资料。在搞资料的时候，可以使他们认识那些主次。把资料印出，可以使其他的人也易于掌握这一领域；第三，进一步走上研究道路。这种方法正确与否我们可以讨论，但在我执行的时候，却显露出资产阶级思想支配下的进行方式。第一步变成为组织了些人帮我写书，由我个人得名得利。第二步变成为我帮助旁人，使他们得名得利，在资料上还少不得提我一提。两步一做，成绩如何，暂置勿论。但有一点倒是可以肯定的，就是大家都沾上了资产阶级图名图利的思想。进入了第三步，就更是自高自大，不可一世的充满了资产阶级思想的所谓人材了。这就是我这三个步骤的写照。与其说我对数论代数组关心，还不如说，我对写一部“数论导引”、写一部“典型群论”更关心；与其说，我对青年们的训练关心，还不如说，我更关心大家给我多提意见，使我把书写得更好。
    在这样的思想指导下，当然对所里面的其他组的工作也就关心得更少了。微分方程组和概率论与数理统计组是重点，但我对他们的关心远远地不够。对常微分方程和偏微分方程都有些意见，但是总是以外行来宽恕自己，而不想通过交谈来提高自己，同时也许可能提醒旁人。对数理逻辑、拓扑、泛函分析没有放在我经常考虑之中，就更不必说了。我是在1953年搞科学规划前不久，听到数理逻辑和电子计算机有关，才予以注意的。
    我的保守思想是和我对人民事业不够忠诚、和我在科学研究工作上走下坡路分不开的。我每年看的新文章不过一、二十篇，我的学术思想水平停滞在三十年代、四十年代，我以往对数学的一般性的了解就没有很好地注意过，仅仅是道听途说地听到一两句。同时我又是不注意理论学习的人，这样就当然不能符合今天的要求了，特别显出和我今天所负的责任不相称了。至于在全国范围内的数学事业的发展更是注意的不够了。如果说偶而注意一下，也不过是蜻蜓点水式的极少的几次而已。这当然是大大地不能符合客观要求的。我今后一定更好地通过科学规划小组和数学会，多多地注意全国数学的发展，尽力之所能地在集体领导的基础上进行一切工作。
    厚旧薄新，厚己薄人，是造成不团结的根源
    总的说来，我在学问上出现了厚旧薄新的保守思想，我在一切工作中间出现了厚己薄人的个人主义思想。
    这种厚己薄人的思想在生活作风中表现得更为清楚。自己搞的问题是重要的，旁人搞的除去特别重要我无话可说的以外，很难得到我的好评。对自己和对人的分辨的依据是如此，对自己的学生和非自己的学生间的分辨的依据也是如此，对自己所专长的分支和自己所不专长的分支是如此，对所内和所外也是如此。
    和我工作久了的同志一定曾经听到过我常说的话：“我对内要求是严格的，同时我并不是不知道全国的水平和世界的水平的情况，在对外的时候，我会作恰当的合乎客观的估价的。”这句话的含意是什么？就是你们不要为我抓得紧、或者责备了你们而不高兴。在对外的时候，我会替你们吹嘘的。事实上，我也如此做了。在这种吹嘘中造成了一阵歪风，只“专”不“红”的风，不正当的业务压力的风。
    这种厚己薄人是造成不团结的根源。数学界的不团结，就我现在所处的地位来说，我应当负最大的责任。最使我痛心的是我和数学界许多人解放前都是没有积怨的，解放后有积怨的人都已经纷纷地改善了，但是我反而和很多人造成了不团结。这还不足以说明我应当负多大的责任和给人民带来多大的损失吗？
    自高自大是我不能团结人的内在因素。我总看不见旁人的优点和自己的缺点。我总是强调旁人的缺点，使我自满，使我不能好好地向旁人学习，不能够团结人。如果我多从人民事业来考虑，我就会感到把仅有的少数老数学家全都团结起来，还不足以满足国家的需要。如果我多多想到同志们的优点，而向他们学习，我会更加爱同志们而团结无间的。在我写检查稿的同时，我也写下了那些与我有过意见的同志们的优点。我一定要从心底里挖掉不团结人的老根子，和同志们团结，共同前进。
    感谢整风运动，让我们把旧账结了，我们在新的思想基础上，在共同进行对数学的集体领导的基础上，互相批评，互相团结，互相学习，互相爱护，向前猛进。同时，也希望群众监督我们，帮助我们。特别是我，如果有时背后乱说，务请同志们给我来一个不客气的迎头痛击。
    我的志愿
    我立志要做一个工人阶级的知识分子，我立志要做到又红又专，我立志要以共产党员的标准要求自己，我立志要争取加入伟大的中国共产党，做一个无产阶级先锋队伍的战士。
                    （在数学研究所交心会上的自我检查摘要）
