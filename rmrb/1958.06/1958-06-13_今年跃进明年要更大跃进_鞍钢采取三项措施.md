Anshan, June 12th (Reported by our correspondent Sun Minghui): The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of responsible Party member cadres from Anshan Iron and Steel's production and construction units to arrange for Anshan Iron and Steel's Great Leap Forward in production and construction next year and the preparations for production and construction. Prior to this meeting, the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee studied the new situation in Anshan Iron and Steel's production and construction this year and the various measures for the Great Leap Forward next year, striving to realize the various leap forward measures early, so that next year's production and construction can achieve an even greater leap forward than this year.

Since the beginning of this year, on the basis of the victory of the Rectification Campaign and the "Double-Anti" movement, an unprecedentedly high tide has emerged in Anshan Iron and Steel's production and construction. Especially after further publicizing and implementing the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the enthusiasm of workers for production and construction has become even more fervent. The completion and production time of major projects has been generally advanced, and a large number of new creations and production records have emerged, providing a strong guarantee for completing and overfulfilling this year's leap forward plan. Based on the new situation that has emerged in production, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in the spirit of "looking at next year from this year, and looking at the next step from this step," has been working on preparations for next year's production and construction since late May, and has initially formulated specific measures and targets for the Great Leap Forward in production and construction next year. At the Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee meetings and the meetings of responsible Party member cadres from Anshan Iron and Steel's production and construction units held successively, the Municipal Party Committee required all units to carefully examine the implementation of the leap forward measures and further prepare for the implementation of these measures to ensure the continuous leap forward in production and construction.

According to the preliminary plan for next year's Great Leap Forward, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production next year will increase by 26% to 34% compared to this year's leap forward plan. This rate of development greatly exceeds this year's rate of development.

An important measure to realize next year's Great Leap Forward plan is to strive for the early construction and commissioning of major projects that have not yet started construction, and to do a good job in various preparatory work before construction. At present, all fifty-one projects of Anshan Iron and Steel that have been included in the basic construction plans for this year and next year are being stepped up in construction and preparation. In late May, Anshan Iron and Steel conducted an inspection of the construction preparation of projects that have not yet started construction and projects that are about to start construction. Based on the inspection, new advanced arrangements were made for the design, equipment, and material supply dates of some major projects. A comprehensive consideration was also made in terms of construction manpower. After such arrangements, the two open-hearth furnaces originally planned to be completed in March and May next year can be put into production in January next year, and the completion time of many other projects can also be greatly advanced.

Another important measure to guarantee next year's Great Leap Forward is to overcome certain weak links in production early through basic construction and saving and utilizing waste. In order to ensure the increase in steel production, in terms of iron smelting, preparations are being actively made to build a large blast furnace and several small blast furnaces. At present, many small blast furnaces have started construction and can produce tens of thousands of tons of pig iron this year. In terms of steelmaking, because some open-hearth furnaces have increased their charging capacity, it has been decided to take measures such as strengthening cranes to solve the difficulties of insufficient equipment. In terms of steel rolling, in order to give full play to the processing capacity of steel ingots, the construction of the two soaking pits originally planned for construction is being accelerated. In order to ensure the gas, water, and steam needed for next year's Great Leap Forward, in addition to appropriately expanding some projects, it is also planned to adopt methods of recovering waste water, waste gas, and waste steam to solve the problem. In mining, sintering, and coking, measures have also been drafted to overcome weak links.

In order to ensure next year's Great Leap Forward, the third important measure taken by Anshan Iron and Steel is to promote some effective technical measures and advanced experiences, and give full play to the production potential of existing enterprises. Since the beginning of this year, many advanced experiences and advanced units have emerged in various factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites. Some technical measures have also achieved good results after being adopted. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace in the iron smelting plant dropped from 0.778 in January to 0.639 in May, of which No. 3 blast furnace reached 0.607, and No. 4 blast furnace reached 0.614. In terms of steelmaking, No. 7 open-hearth furnace in the No. 1 steelmaking plant adopted the measure of expanding the charging capacity in April this year, and the utilization coefficient reached 11.94, and the output increased by a quarter. At present, Anshan Iron and Steel has begun to promote measures to improve raw material conditions. Among them, the iron content of精矿 (concentrates) is planned to be increased from the original 63% to 68% by adding dehydration tanks and other methods. This item alone can increase pig iron production by more than 2%. In terms of open-hearth furnaces, the advanced measure of expanding the charging capacity is currently being promoted, and only some open-hearth furnaces can increase steel production by hundreds of thousands of tons as a result. In terms of steel rolling, measures such as increasing the temperature of steel ingots, increasing the unit weight of steel ingots, and increasing the operating rate have been adopted to increase the output of steel billets and steel products.

### 今年跃进明年要更大跃进  鞍钢采取三项措施

    今年跃进明年要更大跃进
    鞍钢采取三项措施
    本报鞍山12日电　记者孙铭惠报道：中共鞍山市委最近召开鞍钢生产建设单位党员负责干部会议，对鞍钢明年生产建设大跃进和生产建设准备工作进行了安排。在这次会议以前，市委常委会研究了鞍钢今年生产建设方面出现的新情况和明年大跃进的各项措施，争取提早实现各项跃进措施，使明年的生产建设有可能比今年来一个更大的跃进。
    今年以来，在整风和双反运动胜利的基础上，鞍钢生产建设出现了空前高涨的局面，特别是在进一步宣传贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线以后，职工的生产建设热情更加奋发，主要工程的竣工生产时间普遍提前，新的创造和生产纪录大量涌现，为完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划提供了有力的保证。中共鞍山市委根据生产方面目前已经出现的新情况，本着“今年看明年，上步看下步”的精神，从5月下旬以来就着手进行明年生产建设的准备工作，并初步制定了明年生产建设大跃进的具体措施和指标。在先后召开的市委常委会和鞍钢生产建设单位党员负责干部会议上，市委要求各单位认真检查跃进措施的执行情况，并进一步做好执行这些措施的准备工作，保证生产建设不断跃进。
    根据初步确定的明年跃进计划，鞍钢明年钢产量将比今年跃进计划增加26％到34％。这个发展速度大大超过了今年的发展速度。
    实现明年生产大跃进计划的一项重要措施，是争取尚未施工的主要工程提前施工投入生产，做好施工前的各项准备工作。目前，鞍钢已经列入今明两年基本建设计划的五十一项工程，都在加紧施工和加紧准备。5月下旬，鞍钢曾对尚未施工和即将施工的工程的施工准备情况作了一次检查，根据检查对一些主要工程的设计、设备和材料的供应日期，都作了新的提前的安排。在施工力量方面，也作了通盘考虑。经过这样安排，原来打算在明年3月和5月竣工的两座平炉可以提前在明年1月投入生产，其他许多工程的竣工时间也都可以大大提前。
    保证明年生产大跃进的另一项重要措施，是通过基本建设和节约利废的办法，提早克服生产上的某些薄弱环节。为了保证钢的增产，炼铁方面，正在积极准备建设一座大型高炉和建设若干小高炉，目前，已有好多座小高炉动工建设，今年就可以生产几万吨生铁。炼钢方面，由于有些平炉装入量扩大，已决定采取加固吊车等措施，以解决某些设备不足的困难。在轧钢方面，为了充分发挥钢锭的处理能力，目前正在加速准备原计划建设的两座均热炉的施工。为了保证明年生产大跃进所需要的煤气、水和蒸气，除了适当扩建一些工程外，还准备采取回收废水、废煤气和废蒸气的办法加以解决。在矿山、烧结、炼焦等方面，也都拟订了克服薄弱环节的措施。
    为了保证明年生产大跃进，鞍钢采取的第三个重要措施，是推广一些行之有效的技术措施和先进经验，充分地发挥现有企业的生产潜力。今年以来，各厂矿企业和工地都出现了不少先进经验和先进单位，有些技术措施经过采用也取得了良好效果。炼铁厂高炉利用系数从1月份的0.778降到5月份的0.639，其中三号高炉达到了0.607，四高炉0.614。炼钢方面，第一炼钢厂七号平炉今年4月采取扩大装入量的措施，利用系数达到了11.94，产量提高了四分之一。现在，鞍钢已开始推行改善原料条件的措施，其中精矿含铁成分通过增设脱水槽等办法，计划由原来的63％提高到68％，仅此一项就可以使生铁增产2％以上。平炉方面目前正在推行扩大装入量的先进措施，仅部分平炉因此就可以增产几十万吨钢。轧钢方面已经开始采取提高钢锭温度，加大钢锭单位重量，提高作业率等办法，来提高钢坯和钢材的产量。
