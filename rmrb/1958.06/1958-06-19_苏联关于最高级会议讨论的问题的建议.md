Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th (TASS): "Pravda" published on the 17th the Soviet government's proposals on some issues to be submitted to the Heads of Government Conference for discussion, which were put forward on May 5 this year. The full text of the proposal is as follows:

On January 8, 1958, the Soviet government submitted specific proposals on easing international tensions to other governments for study. These proposals advocated that a high-level meeting of leaders of various countries with the participation of heads of government should discuss issues, the resolution of which would help ease international tensions and build international trust.

As always, the Soviet government believes that there are many urgent international issues that can now be resolved. Its position is that it is not only necessary but also possible for countries to reach agreements on some unresolved issues in international relations. For its part, the Soviet Union has put forward such issues and is willing to participate in the study of other issues that may be raised by the participants in the summit meeting, naturally on the condition that these issues fall within the purview of international conferences and that their purpose is to strengthen peace.

The Soviet government firmly believes that if the heads of government of all countries are determined to seek mutually acceptable ways to solve urgent international problems, then it can be said with full confidence that the upcoming summit meeting will guarantee the necessary transformation in the development of relations between countries, normalize the overall international situation, and eliminate the "Cold War."

Taking into account the past exchange of views on convening a summit conference, and in order to promote the completion of the preparations for this conference in the shortest possible period, the Soviet government proposes the following issues for the conference to study, and at the same time expresses some views on these issues:

(1) Immediate cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons

The cessation of testing of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons is an imminent and practically solvable problem. The universal cessation of testing of such weapons will have a good impact on strengthening the cause of peace and stopping the further expansion of armaments. An agreement reached on this issue will have a certain restraining effect on the production of new atomic and hydrogen weapons with greater destructive power, and it will be a practical step towards a complete ban on such weapons of mass destruction.

The reason why we must solve this problem immediately is also because, as many great scientists have proved, the continued testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, increasing the concentration of atomic radiation in the atmosphere, soil, and water, is already posing a serious danger to the health and lives of contemporary people, and threatens the normal development of future generations. If the experimental explosions of nuclear weapons are not ended, this danger will increase in the future.

Now only three countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, produce nuclear weapons. Under the condition that the Soviet Union has unilaterally stopped testing nuclear weapons, the cessation of testing of such weapons now depends entirely on the United States and the United Kingdom. The Soviet government is awaiting the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing by the United States and the United Kingdom so that the Heads of Government Conference can negotiate a corresponding agreement to affirm these decisions of the three countries.

Although modern technological tools for detecting nuclear explosions make it possible to record any explosion of atomic and hydrogen weapons (no matter where the explosion takes place), and although each relevant country can supervise the other party's implementation of the agreement to stop testing, the Soviet government reiterates its agreement to establish international supervision of the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and to establish international monitoring posts, which the Soviet Union had already proposed in June 1957. The Soviet government believes that as long as the United States and the United Kingdom governments also stop continuing to test these weapons, it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on specific measures for such supervision. Otherwise, any negotiations on the issue of supervision, whether at the expert level or at other levels, will inevitably turn into futile arguments and will certainly not have any practical results.

Making the issue of cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons dependent on the solution of other disarmament issues means in practice refusing to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, because there are still serious differences on other disarmament issues, and the solution of these issues is more complicated.

Although the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing by countries possessing nuclear weapons would put the Warsaw Pact member states in a disadvantageous position compared to the NATO countries, because the Soviet Union has conducted far fewer atomic and hydrogen weapon explosion tests than the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union still does so in order to lay a practical foundation for stopping the atomic arms race. If the United States and the United Kingdom accept this proposal, it will be possible to end atomic and hydrogen weapon testing universally and permanently.

(2) On not using all kinds of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons

The Soviet government believes that an agreement among the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which possess nuclear weapons, on not using all types of such weapons (including air bombs, rockets of any range with atomic and hydrogen warheads, and atomic cannons, etc.) will be an important step in eliminating the danger of atomic war and easing tensions between countries. In the event of the conclusion of an agreement on not using nuclear weapons, any government that dares to violate such an agreement will be exposed in the eyes of the people of all countries as an aggressor and an enemy of peace.

The great significance of such agreements has been confirmed by historical experience. Everyone knows that the Geneva Protocol signed in 1925 on the prohibition of the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons played a major role in preventing the use of such weapons during World War II. The Soviet government believes that the decision not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons can be affirmed by expanding the 1925 Geneva Protocol to nuclear weapons and rocket weapons.

The Soviet government believes that an agreement among the major powers on not using nuclear weapons and rocket weapons at the present stage will create favorable prerequisites for the implementation of measures in the next stage, such as completely and unconditionally prohibiting nuclear weapons, ceasing production and eliminating such weapons from the armaments of various countries, and destroying all stockpiles of such weapons.

(3) On establishing a nuclear weapon-free, atomic weapon-free, and rocket weapon-free zone in Central Europe

Central Europe now has two opposing groups of countries, and it concentrates a large number of armed forces and various types of armaments that are abnormal in peacetime. This situation alone poses a serious threat to the cause of peace, and we cannot close our eyes to the fact that under such circumstances, a new war using the most modern destructive weapons - nuclear and rocket weapons - may break out either due to malice or due to an accident.

In order to eliminate the danger of such a development, the Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to study at the conference the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of Poland on establishing a nuclear weapon-free, hydrogen weapon-free, and rocket weapon-free zone in Europe, which would include the territories of the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, and the Federal Republic of Germany. The commitment of these countries not to produce or allow the installation of any type of nuclear weapon or rocket launching device capable of carrying nuclear warheads on their territories will undoubtedly help prevent the possibility of military conflict in Central Europe.

Since the governments of the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the German Democratic Republic have stated that they agree to participate in the nuclear weapon-free zone, the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone now depends entirely on whether the Federal Republic of Germany agrees.

An agreement among the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the advisability of establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in this region of Europe will undoubtedly help reach an agreement with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the issue of the Federal Republic of Germany's participation in this zone.

If, in addition to the countries participating in the nuclear weapon-free zone undertaking corresponding obligations, those major powers whose own troops are equipped with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons undertake to respect the status of this zone, considering that the territories of the countries participating in this zone are not within the scope of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons, then the agreement on establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in Europe will be practical and effective.

As for the Soviet Union, it has already stated that it is willing to undertake the above-mentioned obligations, if the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France also do so.

The obligations undertaken by the countries participating in the nuclear weapon-free zone and the obligations undertaken by the major powers can be fixed by appropriate international treaties or by appropriate unilateral declarations.

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the obligations and their implementation, the countries concerned should ensure the establishment of a broad and effective system of ground and air supervision in the territory of the nuclear weapon-free zone, and establish monitoring stations in accordance with the agreements signed by the corresponding countries.

The establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe will be an important step on the road to stopping the dangerous arms race and eliminating the threat of atomic war.

(4) Non-Aggression Pact

In order to promote the easing of international tensions, the Soviet government believes that the signing of a non-aggression pact (or agreement) in this or that form between the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization is in line with the interests of stopping the "Cold War" and the arms race. The signing of such a pact will be an important step on the road to establishing a pan-European security system and strengthening mutual trust and cooperation between countries.

If the Western countries are willing to sign this pact or agreement, then the Soviet government believes that it is not difficult to reach an agreement on the form of concluding a non-aggression pact or agreement on the basis of a multilateral agreement among all countries participating in the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or among some countries belonging to these two groups, or on a bilateral basis between individual participating countries in these two groups.

The Soviet government believes that the basis of this agreement should be that the contracting parties shall not use force or the threat of force against each other, and shall undertake to resolve disputes that may arise between the participating countries in the agreement only by peaceful means. It should also be stipulated that it is appropriate for the participating countries in the agreement to make suggestions to each other regarding the performance of the obligations they have undertaken under the agreement.

This pact welcomes the participation of all other countries in Europe in order to contribute to the establishment of a pan-European security system in the next stage and the gradual elimination of existing military and political blocs.

The Soviet government suggests concluding a non-aggression pact, considering it as the first step towards thoroughly improving relations between the countries participating in the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, and as a prerequisite for concluding a broader European security treaty in the next stage.

(5) On the Prohibition of the Use of Outer Space for War Purposes, on the Elimination of Foreign Military Bases on the Territory of Other Countries, and on International Cooperation in the Study of Outer Space

Scientific and technological progress in rocket technology raises the question of what path to take to utilize the latest scientific achievements: to use them to serve peaceful purposes, or to use them to intensify the arms race, thereby exacerbating the danger of an atomic war breaking out.

A thorough and unconditional ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons, the elimination of such weapons from armaments, and the destruction of stockpiles of such weapons will be an effective measure that can completely exclude the possibility of using outer space for war purposes and can ensure that the great achievements in the manufacture of rockets and artificial earth satellites are fully used for peaceful purposes. Since at present, due to the position of the Western countries, it is still difficult to achieve this, it seems that it can only be realized in the next stage, so the Soviet government suggests reaching an agreement at the present stage on the following issues: prohibiting the use of outer space for war purposes, and at the same time withdrawing foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, and first of all in the territories of some countries in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. This measure is in line with the security interests of all countries. As for the countries that have such military bases on their territory, they will only benefit from this decision, because the elimination of foreign bases will eliminate the threat brought about by their providing their territory for the establishment of foreign military bases.

Based on such considerations, the Soviet government suggests discussing the issue of concluding an international agreement on using outer space for peaceful purposes, which should include the following basic contents:

Prohibit the use of outer space for war purposes, and countries undertake to launch rockets into outer space only in accordance with already negotiated international plans.

Eliminate foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, first of all in the territories of some countries in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

Establish corresponding international supervision within the framework of the United Nations for the implementation of the above-mentioned obligations.

The United Nations establishes an institution for international cooperation in the study of outer space.

The signing of such an agreement would open the way for broad international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space and would open up an initiative for scientists from various countries to jointly study issues related to the universe.

(6) On Reducing the Number of Foreign Troops Stationed in Germany and Stationed in Other European Countries

On the one hand, the Soviet Union has always been unswervingly striving to reach the necessary agreements with other countries, and at the same time, it has repeatedly put forward various specific proposals on disarmament and has also taken a series of unilateral measures to reduce its own armed forces and armaments. The Soviet Union does so with the starting point of hoping that other major powers will also follow this example. The Soviet Union advocates a thorough solution to the issue of disarmament, a substantial reduction in the armed forces and armaments of various countries, the complete withdrawal of foreign armed forces from the territories of the member states of the two military blocs in Europe (including Germany), and the elimination of all foreign military bases on the territory of other countries.

However, since the Western countries have not yet expressed their readiness to conclude agreements on all these issues to this day, the Soviet Union suggests embarking on the solution of issues at the present stage that can be fully agreed upon today. The Soviet government suggests gradually reducing the number of foreign troops stationed on the territory of other countries, and suggests, as a first step, reducing the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries that have troops stationed in Germany by one-third during 1958, or reducing them according to other amounts that have been negotiated. The portions of these troops that are reduced should be withdrawn from German territory to their own countries.

The issues of substantially reducing the armed forces and armaments of various countries, of concluding corresponding international agreements for this purpose, and of the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization can be discussed at the next stage of talks.

(7) On Concluding a German Peace Treaty

All the European peoples who were involved in the war on the side of Hitler's Germany have long enjoyed the fruits of peace, and they are independently building their own lives, while the German people are still deprived of the conditions for the peaceful development of their own country and for equal existence with the peoples of other countries. The absence of a peace treaty has also had an adverse impact on the solution of the German people's national question - the unification of the country. In addition, those who do not cherish the fate of peace in Europe are using the outstanding issues related to the peaceful settlement with Germany to drag West Germany into the preparation for atomic war.

The Soviet government believes that under such circumstances, the countries that are responsible for the peaceful development of Germany should do their best to seek a peaceful settlement with Germany as soon as possible. As a supporter of such a settlement, the Soviet government reiterates the proposal to request the summit meeting to discuss the issue of drafting and concluding a German peace treaty.

However, taking into account the attitude expressed by the United States and other Western governments towards this proposal, the Soviet government is willing to reach an agreement at the upcoming conference, even if it is only on preliminary measures to resolve the following issue: to agree at the present stage on the basic principles of the German peace treaty and its drafting procedure. In this regard, the Soviet government's starting pointis that the preparatory work for concluding a German peace treaty with the participation of German representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the German Federal Republic will promote the joint efforts of the German Democratic Republic and the German Federal Republic to achieve rapprochement and restore the unity of the German people.

(8) On Preventing a Sudden Attack by One Country on Another

Since it is not yet possible to solve the entire disarmament issue and only agreements on partial disarmament measures can be reached, the Soviet government suggests gradually solving the issue of sudden attacks in conjunction with the nature of the first stage of disarmament steps. Agreements should be reached on the establishment of monitoring posts at railway hubs, major ports, and highway trunk lines, and agreements should also be reached on aerial photography in the areas where the main armed forces of the European military blocs are adjacent (in some limited areas that are considered most important from the perspective of eliminating the danger of sudden attacks at the present stage).

The Soviet government suggests solving this problem in this way based on the fact that the Western countries have already considered the Soviet proposal on establishing monitoring posts as a means of preventing sudden attacks to be appropriate. This gives reason to hope that the conference will be able to reach an agreement on this issue.

The Soviet government reiterates its proposal to establish an aerial inspection zone within eight hundred kilometers to the east and west of the line of demarcation between the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization in Europe.

As for the proposal to conduct aerial photography over vast areas or the entire territories of the Soviet Union and the United States, this issue cannot be discussed in isolation from measures to ease international tensions and strengthen trust among countries, especially major powers. In the current international situation, when the arms race that creates international tensions and creates mistrust and suspicion in international relations is still continuing, and when the "Cold War" casts a shadow over the entire international situation, the proposal to fly around each other everywhere in the entire territory of the two countries is unrealistic. However, the Soviet government believes that this measure can be implemented at the final stage of the disarmament issue, that is, when the issue of completely prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons and eliminating such weapons from armaments, substantially reducing the armed forces and armaments of various countries, and eliminating foreign military bases in other countries is resolved, that is, when genuine trust is established between countries.

(9) On Measures to Expand International Trade Relations

The Soviet government believes that there is currently a completely realistic possibility of implementing a series of measures to expand international trade relations, as a natural and most reliable basis for peaceful cooperation among all countries regardless of social system. In order to restore and expand trade between Western countries and the huge market of the East with nearly one billion people, it is first necessary to eliminate the discrimination and restrictions that still exist and hinder the expansion of international trade.

At present, due to industrial recession and reduced trade, many Western countries are experiencing serious economic difficulties, and the way out of these difficulties should also be sought on the road to developing international trade, and should not be sought on the road to the arms race, strengthening economic warfare, and blockades.

The Soviet government suggests adopting a declaration on the basic principles of international economic cooperation as concrete measures to expand international trade, hoping that it will stipulate adherence to the principles of complete equality, mutual benefit, and no discrimination in international economic and trade relations; respect for the sovereignty of each country in handling its own wealth and natural resources; mutual assistance and assistance to underdeveloped countries in developing their economies, without putting forward any political, military, or other requirements that are incompatible with the national sovereignty of these countries.

The necessity of convening an international economic conference has also matured. At this conference, it is best to discuss the further development of international trade on a long-term basis, in order to establish trust and stability among the trading countries, and to discuss the establishment of an international trade institution within the framework of the United Nations that is open to all countries.

It is also necessary to discuss such urgent issues as the rational use of world economic resources and assistance to underdeveloped countries. In order to provide such assistance, more sources of funding can be found by reducing military spending.

(10) On Developing Contacts and Exchanges Between Countries

The Soviet government believes that the development of international contacts is of great significance, and has always advocated the development of East-West contacts, and that the establishment of broader political, economic, and cultural ties between countries, regardless of their different social systems, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, is in line with the vital interests of the peoples of all countries and will strengthen friendship and business cooperation among the peoples of all countries. The successful conclusion of the Soviet-American bilateral negotiations and the signing of the Soviet-American cultural, technical, and educational agreement in Washington, as well as the fact that scientists from many countries are cooperating successfully in accordance with the International Geophysical Year plan, prove this.

The Soviet government also believes that arranging and expanding regular direct contacts between state leaders and public figures of various countries in the East and West to exchange views on urgent international issues is of great significance. Recently, the methods of expanding such contacts and exchanges may include: mutual dispatch of parliamentary delegations and delegations of social organizations; mutual dispatch of delegations of scientific, technical, and cultural workers; mutual dispatch of actors, theatrical troupes, and symphony orchestras, etc.; exchange of scientific and technical literature and materials, including design books and drawings of machinery and equipment, descriptions of technological regulations, etc.; free visits to industrial exhibitions; mutual dispatch of university students, professors, and university delegations; vigorous encouragement of travel, sports contacts, etc.

(11) On Stopping the Propaganda of War, Enmity, and Hatred Among Peoples of Various Countries

Although it has been more than ten years since the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in October 1947 prohibiting war propaganda, many countries have not implemented this unanimously adopted resolution of the General Assembly. In these countries, the idea that a new war is inevitable is constantly instilled into the people through newspapers, radio, television, and other means, proving that it is necessary to carry out a nuclear arms race and further increase military budgets and residents' taxes.

There is no doubt that as long as all participants in the summit meeting are sincere and have this desire towards each other, it is not difficult to reach an agreement on stopping war propaganda and launching propaganda for friendship among peoples of various countries.

This issue can also be resolved by adopting a joint declaration, in which the governments of the participating countries in the conference can effectively declare their willingness to strictly implement the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of October 1947 on prohibiting any war propaganda hostile to the cause of peace and mutual understanding, and ensure that effective measures are taken to stop such propaganda in their own countries.

(12) On Ways to Ease Tensions in the Middle East

In recent years, the Middle East has periodically become a hotbed of tensions, breeding dangerous international conflicts that could lead to a disruption of universal peace. In order to ease tensions in the Middle East, it is necessary to establish confidence for the countries in this region that any action by any aggressive force to disrupt peace in the Middle East will be resolutely condemned and stopped. One of these measures is that the major powers can issue a joint statement condemning the practice of using force to resolve disputes in the Middle East, and condemning interference in the internal affairs of the countries in this region. It can also be agreed that the participating countries in the conference mutually guarantee not to transport weapons to the countries in the Middle East, nor to deploy nuclear weapons and rocket weapons in these countries.

Taking into account the economic difficulties encountered by the countries in the Middle East and their desire to consolidate their national independence, it is also necessary to study the issue of conducting economic cooperation with the countries in the Middle East, especially helping them establish national industries. Here, we should proceed from the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit, and should not put forward any political, military, or other conditions that are incompatible with the principles of independence and sovereignty.

The Soviet government is confident that the sincerity and willingness to find mutually acceptable solutions on the premise of fully considering the interests of both parties can guarantee the success of the summit meeting and create the necessary turning point in the development of the international situation that is conducive to consolidating international peace.

### 苏联关于最高级会议讨论的问题的建议

    苏联关于最高级会议讨论的问题的建议
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社莫斯科17日电：“真理报”17日发表了苏联政府关于提交政府首脑会议讨论的一些问题的建议，这个建议是在今年5月5日提出的。建议全文如下：
    1958年1月8日，苏联政府曾经把有关缓和国际紧张局势问题的具体建议交给其他国家政府研究。这些建议主张有政府首脑参加的各国领导人高级会议应当讨论这样一些问题，这些问题的解决会有助于缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际信任。
    苏联政府同以往一样，认为有许多迫切的国际问题现在已经可以解决。它的立场是：各国对于国际关系上的一些没有解决的问题相互取得协议不仅是必要的，而且也是可能的。苏联从自己这方面提出了这样一些问题，并愿意参加研究高级会议参加国可能提出的其他问题，自然要有一个条件，就是这些问题属于国际会议的权限范围，而其目的是为了加强和平。
    苏联政府深信，假如各国政府首脑坚决致力于寻求彼此可以接受的、解决迫切的国际问题的办法，那么可以满怀信心地说，即将召开的高级会议将保证在发展各国之间的关系方面获得必要的转变，使整个国际局势正常化和消除“冷战”。
    考虑到过去就召开高级会议交换的意见，并且为了促进在尽可能短的期间内完成这次会议的准备工作，苏联政府方面提出下列问题供会议研究，同时就这些问题发表一些看法：
    （一）立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器
    停止试验各种类型的原子武器和氢武器是刻不容缓的、而且实际上是可以解决的问题。普遍停止试验这种武器对加强和平事业和停止进一步扩充军备会有良好的影响。就这一问题达成的协定对生产新的杀伤力更大的原子武器和氢武器将会起一定的制止作用，它将是走向完全禁止这种大规模毁灭性武器的一个实际步骤。
    我们之所以必须立即解决这一问题，还由于，据许多大科学家证明，继续试验原子武器和氢武器，增加大气、土壤和水中原子辐射的浓度，这种情况现在已经对当代人的健康和生命产生了严重的危险，并且威胁着未来一代的正常发育。如果不结束核武器的试验性爆炸，这种危险将来还会增加。
    现在只有苏联、美国和英国三个国家生产核武器，在苏联已经单方面停止试验核武器的条件下，现在停止这种武器的试验就完全要看美英两国了。苏联政府正在期待美英两国立即停止试验核武器，以便政府首脑会议能协商以相应的协定把三国的这些决定肯定下来。
    虽然发现核爆炸的现代技术工具使得有可能记录原子武器和氢武器的任何爆炸（不管这种爆炸在什么地点进行），虽然每个有关的国家自己可以监督对方执行停止试验的协定的情况，但是，苏联政府再次表示同意建立对停止试验核武器的国际监督，并建立国际监督哨，这一点，苏联早在1957年6月就已经提出过。苏联政府认为，只要美国和英国政府也停止继续试验这种武器，那么要达成有关这种监督的具体措施的协议是不困难的。否则，任何研究监督问题的谈判，不论是专家级或是别的级的谈判，都不可避免地要变成徒劳无益的争论，当然不会有任何实际的结果。
    使停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题取决于其他裁军问题的解决，就意味着实际上拒绝停止试验原子武器和氢武器，因为关于其他裁军问题还正存在着严重分歧，而且这些问题的解决是比较复杂的。
    虽然拥有核武器的国家现在就立即停止核武器试验，会使华沙条约参加国处于比北大西洋公约组织国家不利的地位，因为苏联所进行的原子武器和氢武器爆炸试验比美国和英国少得多，但是，苏联仍然这样做，为的是给停止原子军备竞赛奠定一个实际的开端。如果美国和英国接受这个建议，就能够普遍和永久地结束原子武器和氢武器试验。
    （二）关于不使用一切种类的原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器
    苏联政府认为，拥有核武器的苏联、美国和英国三国就共同不使用一切类型的这种武器（其中包括航空炸弹、带原子弹头和氢弹头的任何射程的火箭和原子炮等）达成协议，将是消除原子战争危险和缓和各国之间紧张关系的重要步骤。在缔结了关于不使用核武器协定的情况下，任何一个胆敢破坏这种协定的政府将在各国人民的眼前暴露出它是侵略者，是和平的敌人。
    这类协定的重大意义是为历史经验所证实了的。大家都知道，1925年签定的关于禁止使用化学和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书在第二次世界大战中，在防止使用这种武器方面起了重大的作用。苏联政府认为，关于不使用原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器的决定是可以通过把1925年的日内瓦议定书扩大到核武器和火箭武器方面的办法而加以确定。
    苏联政府认为，各大国关于在现阶段不使用核武器和火箭武器的协定，将可以创造有利的前提来在下一阶段实现这样一些措施，如完全和无条件地禁止核武器、停止生产和从各国军备中取缔这种武器、销毁这种武器的一切储备。
    （三）关于在中欧建立无原子武器、核武器和火箭武器地区
    中欧现在有两个相互对抗的国家集团，并且集中有在和平时期不正常的大批武装力量和各种类型的军备。单单是这种情况就造成了对和平事业的严重威胁，我们不能闭眼不看到这一事实：在这种情况下，或者由于恶意或者由于偶然事故，可能爆发使用最现代化的毁灭性武器——核武器和火箭武器的新战火。
    为了消除这种事态发展的危险性，苏联政府认为这样做是适宜的：在会议上研究波兰人民共和国政府关于在欧洲建立无原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器地区的建议，这个地区将包括波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的领土。这些国家承担义务不生产、也不允许在本国领土上设置各种类型的核武器以及可以携带核弹头的火箭发射装置，无疑地将有助于防止在欧洲中部发生军事冲突的可能性。
    既然波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国政府已经声明，它们同意参加无原子武器区，因此现在能否建立无原子武器区就完全要看德意志联邦共和国是否同意了。
    苏、美、英、法四国政府就在欧洲的这个地区建立无原子武器区的适宜性达成协议，无疑地会有助于同德意志联邦共和国政府就德意志联邦共和国参加这个地区的问题达成协议。
    如果除了参加无原子武器区的国家承担相应的义务以外，那些本国军队配备有核武器与火箭武器的大国承担义务尊重这个地区的地位，认为参加这个地区的国家的领土不在使用原子武器、氢武器与火箭武器的范围之内，那么关于在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的协定便会是切实有效的。
    至于苏联，它已经声明它愿意承担上述义务，如果美、英、法三国政府也这样做的话。
    参加无原子武器区的各国承担的义务和各大国承担的义务可以通过适当的国际条约，也可以通过适当的单方面宣言固定下来。
    为了保证义务的有效性及其执行，有关国家应保证在无原子武器区的领土上建立广泛有效的地面和空中监督制度，并根据相应国家签订的协议建立监督站。
    在中欧建立无原子武器区将是停止危险的军备竞赛和消除原子战争威胁道路上的重要步骤。
    （四）互不侵犯公约
    为了促进国际紧张局势的缓和，苏联政府认为，北大西洋公约成员国和华沙条约成员国之间以这种或那种形式签订互不侵犯公约（或协定）是符合停止“冷战”和军备竞赛的利益的。签订这种公约将是走向建立全欧安全体系，加强国与国之间的相互信任与合作道路上的重要步骤。
    假如西方国家愿意签订这项公约或协定，那么苏联政府认为，在参加华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约的全体国家、或者在属于这两个集团的某些国家之间多边协议的基础上，或者在这两个集团个别参加国之间双边的基础上，就缔结互不侵犯公约或协定的形式达成协议并不是困难的。
    苏联政府认为，这项协定的基础应该是缔约各方互不使用武力或武力威胁，并且承担义务只用和平方式解决协定参加国之间可能发生的争端。还应当规定，协定参加国针对它们根据协定所承担的义务的履行情况互相提出意见是适宜的。
    这项公约欢迎欧洲所有其他国家参加，以便有助于在下一阶段建立全欧安全体系和逐步消除现有的军事政治集团。
    苏联政府建议缔结互不侵犯协定，认为这是彻底改善参加北大西洋联盟和华沙条约组织各国之间关系的第一步，认为这是在下一阶段缔结更广泛的欧洲安全条约的前提。
    （五）关于禁止利用宇宙空间于战争目的、关于取消在别国领土上的外国军事基地和关于在研究宇宙空间方面的国际合作
    火箭技术方面的科学技术进步提出了沿着什么样的道路去利用最新科学成就的问题：是利用它们为和平目的服务，还是利用它们去加紧军备竞赛，从而加剧爆发原子战争的危险性。
    彻底地、无条件地禁止原子武器和氢武器，从军备中取消这种武器以及销毁这种武器的贮存将是一个有效的措施，这个措施完全可以排除把宇宙空间用于战争目的的可能性，并可以保证把制造火箭和人造地球卫星方面的巨大成就完全用于和平目的。既然在目前，由于西方国家的立场，做到这一点还是困难的，看来要在下一阶段才能实现，所以苏联政府建议在现阶段就下列问题达成协议：禁止把宇宙空间用于战争目的，并且同时撤消在别国领土上，而首先是在欧洲、中近东、北非一些国家领土上的外国军事基地。这个措施符合各国安全的利益。至于谈到在本国领土上有这种军事基地的国家，它们从这个决定中只会得到好处，因为取消外国基地将消除由于它们提供本国领土设立外国军事基地而招来的威胁。
    本着这样一些考虑，苏联政府建议讨论缔结关于把宇宙空间用于和平目的的国际协定的问题，这一协定应包括以下基本内容：
    禁止把宇宙空间用于战争目的，各国承担义务只根据已经协商好的国际计划向宇宙空间发射火箭。
    取消在别国领土上，首先是在欧洲、中近东、北非一些国家领土上的外国军事基地。
    在联合国范围内对上述义务的实现建立相应的国际监督。
    联合国建立一个研究宇宙空间国际合作的机构。
    签订这样的协定就会给在和平利用宇宙空间方面的广泛国际合作开辟道路，并会为各国科学家共同研究同宇宙有关的问题打开一个开端。
    （六）关于裁减驻扎在德国境内和驻扎在其他欧洲国家境内的外国军队的人数
    苏联一方面始终不渝地争取同其他国家达成必要的协议，同时就裁军问题一再提出了各种具体建议，而且还采取了一系列单方面措施来裁减自己的武装力量和军备，苏联这样做的出发点是，希望其他大国方面也效法这种榜样。苏联主张彻底解决裁军问题、大大缩减各国的武装力量和军备、外国武装力量从欧洲两个军事集团参加国（包括德国在内）的领土上全部撤出和取消在别国领土上的一切外国军事基地。
    但是，既然西方国家直到今天还没有表示准备就所有这些问题缔结协定，所以苏联建议在现阶段着手解决在今天就有充分可能达成协议的问题。苏联政府建议逐步裁减驻扎在别国领土上的外国军队，并建议作为第一步首先在1958年期间把苏联、美国、英国、法国和其他在德国境内驻有军队的国家的武装力量裁减三分之一或者根据经过协商的其他数额进行裁减。这些军队中被裁减下来的部分应当从德国领土撤回本国。
    关于大大裁减各国的武装力量和军备、关于为此目的缔结相应的国际协定，以及关于外国军队从北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国完全撤出的问题可以在下一阶段会谈讨论。
   （七）关于缔结德国和约
    所有站在希特勒德国方面而卷入战争的欧洲各国人民早已享受到和平状态的果实，他们正在独立地建设自己的生活，而德国人民却仍然被剥夺本国和平发展和同其他国家人民平等生存的条件。由于没有和约，就对解决德国人民的全民族的问题——国家的统一也起了不良的影响。此外，那些不珍视欧洲和平命运的人，利用与德国和平解决有关的问题的悬而未决，把德国西部拖入原子战争的准备中。
    苏联政府认为，在这种情况下，对德国和平发展负有责任的国家应当尽自己的努力来尽速求得同德国的和平解决。作为这种解决的拥护者，苏联政府重申关于要求高级会议讨论起草和缔结德国和约问题的建议。
    但是，考虑到美国和其他西方国家政府对这个建议所表示的态度，苏联政府愿意在即将举行的会议上哪怕就解决下列问题的初步措施达成协议也好，这个问题就是：在现阶段商定德国和约及其起草程序的基本原则。在这方面，苏联政府的出发点是，有来自德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的德国代表参加的缔结德国和约的准备工作，将会推动德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国共同努力以达到彼此接近和恢复德国人民统一的目的。
    （八）关于防止一国对另一国的突然进攻
    既然目前还没有可能解决整个裁军问题，只能达成局部裁军措施的协定，所以苏联政府建议，结合第一阶段裁军步骤的性质逐步地解决关于突然进攻的问题。应当就在铁路枢纽、大港口和公路干线上建立监督岗达成协议，还应当就在欧洲军事集团的主要武装力量接壤地区（现阶段在从消除突然进攻的危险性角度来看被认为是最重要的某些有限地区）进行空中摄影达成协议。
    苏联政府建议用这样的办法来解决这个问题，是依据西方国家已经认为苏联关于建立监督岗作为防止突然进攻的手段的建议是适宜的这一点。这就使人有理由希望，会议能够就这个问题达成协议。
    苏联政府重申自己关于在欧洲在北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约两个军事集团的武装力量分界线东西各八百公里内建立空中视察区的建议。
    至于谈到在苏联和美国的广大地区或者全境进行空中摄影的建议，这个问题不能脱离缓和国际紧张局势和加强各国、首先是各大国间的信任的措施来讨论。在目前的国际形势下，当造成国际紧张局势，造成国际关系中的不信任和怀疑的军备竞赛还在继续，当“冷战”给整个国际局势罩上一层暗影时，在两国全境彼此到处飞行的建议是不现实的。但是，苏联政府认为，在裁军问题的最后阶段，也就是说，当完全禁止原子武器和氢武器并且从军备中取缔这类武器、大量裁减各国武装部队和军备、以及消除他国境内的外国军事基地的问题解决时，即当各国之间真正建立起信任关系时，可以实现这个措施。
    （九）关于扩大国际贸易关系的措施
    苏联政府认为，目前存在着完全现实的可能性来实现一系列扩大国际贸易关系的措施，作为不分社会制度的一切国家和平合作的自然的和最可靠的基础。为了恢复和扩大西方国家同拥有将近十亿人口的东方巨大市场的贸易，首先必须消除至今还存在的妨碍国际贸易扩大的歧视和限制。
    目前，由于工业衰退和贸易的减少，很多西方国家正经历着严重的经济困难，困难的出路也应当在发展国际贸易的道路上去寻找，而不应当到军备竞赛、加强经济战争和封锁的道路上去寻找。
    苏联政府建议通过关于国际经济合作基本原则的宣言作为扩大国际贸易的具体措施，希望其中规定在国际经济和贸易关系中遵守完全平等、互利、不容许任何歧视的原则；尊重每个国家处理本国财富和天然资源的主权；互相帮助并且帮助不发达国家发展经济，不得提出任何同这些国家民族主权不相容的政治、军事和其他性质的要求。
    召开国际经济代表会议的必要性也成熟了，在这个会议上最好讨论在长期的基础上进一步发展国际贸易的问题，以便建立起各贸易国家间的信任和稳定性，并且讨论在联合国范围内建立一个向一切国家开门的国际贸易机构。
    还必须讨论这样一些迫切的问题，如合理地利用世界经济资源和援助不发达的国家。为了进行这种援助，可以靠减少军费来找到更多的资金来源。
    （十）关于发展各国间的联系和接触
    苏联政府认为发展国际接触具有很大意义，并且一向主张发展东西方接触，各国不问社会制度的不同，在互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上建立更广泛的政治、经济和文化联系，是符合各国人民的切身利益的，并且会加强各国人民间的友谊和事务上的合作。苏美双边谈判的顺利结束和苏美文化、技术、教育协定在华盛顿的签字，以及很多国家的科学家，按照国际地球物理年计划圆满地合作的事实都证明了这一点。
    苏联政府还认为，安排和扩大东西方各国国家领导人和社会人士的经常的直接接触，来就迫切的国际问题交换意见，是有重大意义的。最近扩大这种联系和接触的方法可能有：互派议会代表团和社会团体代表团；互派科学、技术和文化工作者代表团；互派演员、剧团和交响乐队等等；交换科学技术文献及资料，包括机器和设备的设计书和图纸、工艺规程的说明书等等；自由地参观工业展览会；互派大学生教授和大学代表团；大力鼓励旅行、体育联系等等。
    （十一）关于停止宣传战争、各国人民敌视和仇恨
    尽管联合国大会1947年10月通过禁止战争宣传的决议至今已有十年多，但是很多国家并没有执行大会的这个一致通过的决议。在这些国家里，通过报刊、电台、电视和其他手段经常向人民灌输新战争不可避免的思想，证明必须进行核军备竞赛和进一步增加军事预算以及居民的捐税。
    毫无疑问，只要高级会议的全体参加者具有诚意，彼此都有此愿望，不难就停止战争宣传和展开各国人民友好的宣传的问题达成协议。
    这个问题也可以用通过共同宣言的办法加以解决，在宣言中会议参加国政府可以切实宣告愿意严格执行1947年10月联合国大会关于禁止任何敌视和平和互相谅解事业的战争宣传的决议，并且保证采取有效措施在本国制止这种宣传。
    （十二）关于缓和中近东地区紧张局势的途径
    近几年来，中近东地区周期性地成为紧张局势的温床，孕育着可能导致破坏普遍和平的危险的国际冲突。为了缓和中近东的紧张局势，必须为这个地区的各国建立一种信心，就是任何侵略势力破坏中近东地区和平的任何行动都要受到坚决的谴责和制止。这些措施之一就是，各大国可以发表一个联合声明来谴责用武力解决中近东争端的做法，谴责干涉这个地区各国内政的干涉。还可以议定，会议参加国互相保证不向中近东各国运送武器，也不在这些国家配置核武器和火箭武器。
    考虑到中近东各国所遇到的经济困难和它们巩固本国独立的愿望，还必须研究同中近东各国进行经济合作，特别是帮助它们建立民族工业方面的问题，这里应当从完全平等和互利的原则出发，不得向它们提出任何同独立和主权原则不相容的政治的、军事的或其他条件。
    苏联政府确信，在充分地考虑双方的利益的前提下来寻找互相可以接受的解决办法的诚意和愿望，能够保证高级会议的成功，并且在国际局势的发展中造成有利于巩固国际和平的必要的转折。
