Xinhua News Agency, London, June 19th: British Prime Minister Macmillan today presented a so-called new plan for Cyprus to the House of Commons. The gist of this plan is to permanently occupy Cyprus as a British military base; to implement measures close to partition under British control for the next seven years; and not to grant the residents of Cyprus the right to self-determination in the future.

This new plan stipulates the establishment of separate Houses of Representatives for Greek and Turkish residents to formulate laws concerning residents' affairs. Internal administration will be managed by a council chaired by the British Governor-General with the participation of Greek and Turkish representatives. The British Governor-General will retain power over foreign affairs, defense, and internal security.

According to this plan, the "international status" of the island of Cyprus will not change for seven years.

As for the future of the island, Macmillan said that the British government is only prepared to divide sovereignty between Greece and Turkey on the condition that Britain retains military bases and facilities.

The British Prime Minister's statement was originally intended to be published on June 17th, but it was postponed for two days at the request of the Permanent Representative Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is reported that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, especially the United States, are eager to intervene in the Cyprus issue.

    英国玩弄“新计划”的骗局
    企图永久占领塞浦路斯
    据新华社伦敦19日电　英国首相麦克米伦今天在这里向下院提出了关于塞浦路斯的所谓新计划。这个计划的要旨是永久占领塞浦路斯作为英国的军事基地；在今后七年中，在英国的控制下实行接近于分治的措施；并且在将来也不给予塞浦路斯居民以自决权。
    这个新计划规定分别建立希腊和土耳其居民的代表院来制订有关居民事务的法律。内部行政将由英国总督所主持的有希腊和土耳其代表参加的议会来管理。英国总督将保留对外交、防务和内部安全的权力。
    根据这个计划，塞浦路斯岛的“国际地位”将在七年里不改变。
    至于这个岛的前途，麦克米伦说，只有在让英国保有军事基地和设备的条件下，英国政府才准备把主权分给希腊和土耳其。
    英国首相的这项声明本来打算在6月17日发表，由于北大西洋集团常任代表理事会的要求，结果推迟了两昼夜才发表。据报道，北大西洋集团各国，特别是美国，急于插手干预塞浦路斯问题。
