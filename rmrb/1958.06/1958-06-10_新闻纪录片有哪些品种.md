　　What are the Varieties of News Documentaries?
　　Ma Zheng
　　News documentaries are the vanguards of films. With their short, concise, rich, and colorful artistic forms, they reflect the footprints of our motherland advancing on the road of socialism.

　　News documentaries, as we usually call them, are basically divided into two categories: newsreels and documentaries.

　　Newsreels, also called news magazine films, include several types of films with different characteristics. Taking the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio as an example, the types of films they produced this year include the following:

　　"News Briefs" is a common type of newsreel that we often see. Like a publication, it is published regularly, six issues per month, seventy-two issues per year. Each issue has five or six topics, including one international news item. Its task is to report on major domestic events and construction achievements in industry, agriculture, culture, education, health, and other fields, in accordance with the Party's policies and in conjunction with the current central work; it also captures advanced figures, model deeds, and scientific curiosities that increase knowledge emerging in socialist construction.

　　"Sports Briefs" is a newsreel that focuses on reporting sports-related events. It is published once a month. Its content focuses on promoting and popularizing mass sports activities.

　　"Young Pioneers" is specially made for children. It is published once a month. It mainly educates and helps children become laborers with culture, noble character, and good health.

　　"China Today" is a newsreel distributed abroad. This type of film is released twelve times a year. Its task is to introduce China's socialist construction achievements and its peaceful foreign policy to foreign audiences, so that foreign audiences can increase their understanding of new China.

　　"World Events" is a new type of film that began production this year. It is also released twelve times a year. The film reports on the booming construction achievements of socialist countries, and also shows the increasingly declining situation in capitalist countries.

　　In addition to the newsreels mentioned above, there is also an irregular film called "News Special." In form, it is similar to "News Briefs," but the content focuses on expressing a certain movement or event in coordination with the country's current central work. The recently released "Great Leap Forward in the Countryside" Issues 1 and 2 belong to this type.

　　In terms of documentaries, the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio plans to produce ten feature-length documentaries and one hundred and twenty short documentaries this year.

　　Feature-length documentaries, also known as large-scale documentaries, are generally more than six reels (1,800 meters). Such films include the color film "Song of Mount Everest" and "Ode to Life," which reflects the rapid progress of China's industrial construction.

　　Short documentaries generally have a more concentrated theme, are produced in a short time, and can meet the audience in a timely manner. They are usually between one and six reels. Examples include "May Day," "National Day," "Giving Our Hearts to the Party," and "The Most Beloved People are Back."

　　This year is a year of the Great Leap Forward, and also a year of vigorous development for news documentaries. At present, in addition to the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, each province is preparing to establish film studios. This year, all feature film studios will also devote a lot of effort to produce a considerable number of news documentaries. It is expected that the quantity or quality of news documentaries will be greatly improved this year.

　　新闻纪录片有哪些品种
　　马征
    新闻纪录片是电影中的尖兵。它以短小精悍、丰富多彩的艺术样式，反映着祖国在社会主义道路上前进的足迹。
    我们通常所说的新闻纪录片基本上分作两类：一类是新闻片，一类是纪录片。
    新闻片也叫新闻杂志片，它包括几种性质不同的影片。拿中央新闻纪录电影制片厂来说，他们今年摄制的片种，有以下几种：
    “新闻简报”是我们常见的一种新闻片。它像刊物一样，定期出版，每月出六号，一年出七十二号。每号有五六个主题，其中有一个国际新闻。它的任务是根据党的政策，结合当前的中心工作，报道国内各方面的重大事件和工业、农业、文教、卫生等方面的建设成就；也摄取在社会主义建设中涌现出来的先进人物、模范事迹，以及增长知识的科学珍闻等材料。
    “体育简报”是集中报道有关体育运动方面的新闻片。每月出一号。在内容上以推广和普及群众性的体育锻炼为主。
    “少先队”是专为小朋友们制作的。每月出一号。主要是教育和帮助少年儿童成为有文化、有高尚品德和身体健康的劳动者。
    “今日的中国”是对国外发行的新闻影片。这种影片每年出十二号。它的任务是对国外观众介绍我国社会主义的建设成就及我国的和平外交政策，使国外的观众增进对新中国的了解。
    “世界见闻”是今年开始制作的一个新片种。每年也出十二号。影片报道了社会主义国家蒸蒸日上的建设成就，也表现了资本主义国家日益没落的景象。
    除了上面所说的新闻片以外，还有一种不定期的影片——新闻特辑。在形式上它和“新闻简报”相仿，但内容是配合国家当前的中心工作，集中表现某一运动或某一事件的。不久前上演的“农村大跃进”第一、二辑就属于这一种。
    在纪录片方面，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂今年要摄制长纪录片十部，短纪录片一百二十本。
    长纪录片也称大型纪录片，一般在六本（一千八百公尺）以上。这样的影片如彩色片“珠穆朗玛之歌”及反映我国工业建设一日千里的“生活的凯歌”。
    短纪录片所表现的题材一般都比较集中，制作时间短，能及时和观众见面。通常在一本到六本之间。如“五一节”、“国庆节”、“把心交给党”、“最可爱的人回来了”等便是。
    今年，是大跃进的一年，也是新闻纪录片蓬勃发展的一年。目前除中央新闻纪录电影制片厂以外，每个省都在筹建电影制片厂。各故事片厂，今年也都要抽出很大的力量，来摄制相当数量的新闻纪录片。可以预料，今年的新闻纪录片的数量或质量，都将会有很大的提高。
