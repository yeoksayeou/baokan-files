Promptly Adjust the Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses During the Great Leap Forward
Xushui County's Zhengcun Township Conducts a Mass Line Inspection
Cadre Style Changes, Relationship Between Cadres and Masses Improves, Mass Enthusiasm Greatly Increases

(Our Dispatch) This newspaper reporters Zhang Hua and Wen Ying report: The CCP Zhengcun Township Committee, Xushui County, conducted a mass line inspection, adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses during the Great Leap Forward in production.

In Zhengcun Township, Xushui County, Hebei Province, the relationship between cadres and the masses was, for a time, not very harmonious during the intense drought resistance and sowing efforts. The main reason for the disharmony was that, in the midst of busy and urgent agricultural activities, some township and commune cadres did not earnestly implement the mass line working method to persuade and educate the masses in a thorough and meticulous manner; and when certain work tasks were not completed well, they excessively criticized and blamed the masses, hurting their production enthusiasm. The majority of the township is dry land, and the reservoirs and canals built last winter and this spring have not yet accumulated water. During the spring plowing and sowing, it is not only necessary to carry water to resist drought and sow point by point, but also to drill machine wells to strive for drought resistance and ensure a good harvest. More than 20,000 mu of wheat fields in the township, due to poor emergence from drought-resistant sowing, also need to be strengthened. Coupled with activities such as afforestation and eliminating the "Four Pests", the work is heavy, the tasks are numerous, and the time requirements are also relatively urgent. In addition, this township promoted many new measures in this year's drought resistance and sowing that local people had rarely seen. Due to a lack of experience, some masses were slow to complete these tasks and new measures, and some township and commune cadres became confused on the issue of the mass line, mistakenly believing that the mass line was feasible in normal times, but it was not easy to persuade and educate the masses when there were urgent tasks, so it was better to do it first and then talk about it, do it while talking about it, or just do it without talking about it. Some people even mistakenly believed that general work could come from the masses and go to the masses, but the masses had no experience in the Great Leap Forward and could only obey the commands of the cadres. Therefore, some cadres in the township adopted simplistic methods to deal with the masses when promoting work: for short-term tasks, township cadres went to the communes, and commune cadres took charge of the teams to supervise and carry out crash campaigns; for longer-term tasks, they held meetings to deploy, set deadlines for completion, and criticized those who did not do well. One township cadre even adopted crude and coercive methods because the masses did not water the wheat according to his instructions. In order to rush to complete the tasks, some masses neglected quality, even engaging in work slowdowns and laziness, falsely reporting achievements, and trying to get by with the cadres. In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses gradually became alienated.

In response to the above situation, the CCP Zhengcun Township Committee, under the help and guidance of the Xushui County Party Committee, began to adopt the following improvement measures from late April, and conducted a major inspection of the mass line. First, in conjunction with the handling of forced orders, violations of law and discipline, a mass rally of the whole township was held to vigorously publicize the Party's mass line policy, check the work style of forced orders, and the township Party Committee made a public self-criticism, mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and post big-character posters, criticizing the township leadership. Second, the village and commune Party organizations combined with the rural rectification campaign to focus on checking work styles, and launched three or more mass debates on principled issues such as whether the mass line could be followed when completing urgent tasks, and whether the Great Leap Forward should rely on the masses. During the debates, more than 70 commune and team cadres with a vague understanding of the mass line were criticized under leadership. The commune and team cadres generally made a democratic style inspection. Third, according to the opinions of the masses, the work style of cadres was listed as 15% of the total score of the evaluation, and special evaluations were carried out with mutual supervision from above, below, left, and right, correcting the phenomenon of the task style being divorced from reality. Fourth, the Party's ideological work among the masses was strengthened. In addition to continuing the rural rectification campaign, members of the township Party Committee gave policy reports to the masses every seven days to help the masses solve ideological obstacles in the Great Leap Forward. At the same time, the leadership of the grass-roots Party organizations was strengthened, six backward branches were rectified, and appropriate handling was given to some Party member cadres who had committed forced orders and other errors. Fifth, the method of planting experimental fields and on-site visits was conscientiously implemented to help the masses overcome conservative ideas. People were organized to visit other places to see new things that were not available locally, such as nutrient pots. The branch secretaries of the township and commune Party organizations also personally led the backward communes and teams to prevent forced orders. In addition, the past practice of continuous day and night crash campaigns was changed, and production, study, and meetings were interspersed and combined in the evening, so that the masses had a certain amount of rest time.

After this inspection, the relationship between cadres and the masses in Zhengcun Township has begun to improve. With the change of the cadres' work style, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses have also increased compared with the past. At the mass democratic meeting in the whole township, the masses posted more than 1,700 big-character posters for the cadres in two hours. When the villages conducted inspections, in addition to posting big-character posters and speaking out freely to criticize the ideological and work style errors of the cadres, the masses also put forward nearly a thousand suggestions to help the commune and team cadres improve their work. Some masses also took the initiative to report the illegal acts of individual backward masses to the cadres. During the seedling replenishment and sowing after the rain, 70% of the households in the township closed their doors and went to the fields. Due to the active labor of auxiliary laborers, the attendance rate of the labor force in the township has increased from the original 80% to 125%. After most of the production teams implemented small-scale contract work based on the opinions of the masses, the phenomenon of laziness and work slowdowns was also greatly reduced.

    及时调整大跃进中干部和群众的关系
    徐水县正村乡进行群众路线大检查
    干部作风改变　干群关系改善　群众积极性大增
    本报讯　记者张华、文英报道：中共徐水县正村乡党组织进行群众路线大检查，调整了生产大跃进当中干部和群众的关系。
    河北省徐水县正村乡干部和群众的关系，在紧张的抗旱播种当中，曾有一个时期不太融洽。不融洽的主要原因是，在繁忙急迫的农事活动中，有些乡社干部没有认真贯彻群众路线的工作方法，深入细致地说服教育群众；某些工作任务完成不好时，又过多地对群众进行批评和指责，伤害了群众的生产热情。这个乡大部是旱地，去冬今春修的水库和渠道还没有蓄到水，在春耕播种当中，不仅需要挑水抗旱点种，并且还得打机井，争取抗旱保收。全乡的两万多亩麦田，由于抗旱播种出苗不好，也需要加强管理。再加上植树造林除四害等活动，工作多任务重，时间要求也比较紧急。另外，这个乡在今年的抗旱播种当中，还推行了不少当地群众很少见过的新措施。由于没有经验，部分群众在完成这些任务和新措施时行动较慢，有些乡社干部便在群众路线问题上发生了错觉，误认为群众路线平时行的通，有紧急任务就不容易向群众进行说服教育，只能是先作后说，边作边说，或光作不说。有些人更错误地认为，一般工作可以从群众中来到群众中去，大跃进群众没经验，只能服从干部的指挥。因此，这个乡的一些干部在推行工作时，就采取简单化的办法对待群众：短时间的任务，乡干部下社，社干部包队，督促突击；时间较长的工作，便开会布置，限期完成，作不好就批评。有一个乡干部，因为群众没按他的指示浇麦，竟采取了粗暴的强迫命令的办法。部分群众为赶任务，就忽视质量，甚至窝工偷懒，虚报成绩，应付干部。这样，干部和群众的关系逐渐疏远了。
    针对上述情况，中共正村乡党组织在徐水县委的帮助指导下，从4月下旬开始，采取了以下改进措施，对群众路线进行了一次大检查。一、结合对强迫命令违法乱纪分子的处理，召开全乡群众大会，大张旗鼓地宣传党的群众路线政策，检查强迫命令的作风，乡党委当众检讨，发动群众大鸣大放贴大字报，批评乡的领导。二、村社党组织结合农村整风专门检查作风，并就完成紧急任务时能不能走群众路线，大跃进要不要依靠群众等带有原则性的问题，开展了三次以上的全民大辩论。在辩论中还有领导地批判了七十多名对群众路线认识模糊的社队干部。社队干部普遍作了一次民主作风检查。三、根据群众意见，将干部作风列为评比总分数的15％，进行专题评比，上下左右互相监督，纠正了任务作风脱节的现象。四、加强了党对群众的思想工作，除继续进行农村整风外，乡党委委员每七天向群众分别作一次政策报告，帮助群众解决跃进中的思想障碍。同时加强对基层党组织的领导，整顿了六个落后支部，并对一些犯有强迫命令和其他错误的党员干部，进行了适当的处理。五、认真执行种试验田和现场参观的方法，帮助群众克服保守思想，对营养钵等本地没有的新东西，组织人到外地参观。乡社党组织的支部书记，还亲自动手领导落后的社队，防止发生强迫命令。另外还改变了过去连续日夜突击的办法，晚上时间生产、学习、开会穿插结合，使群众有一定的休息时间。
    经过这次检查，正村乡干部和群众的关系已开始好转。随着干部作风的转变，群众的政治积极性和生产积极性也较前提高了。在全乡群众民主大会上，群众在两个小时内，就给干部贴出了一千七百多张大字报。各村进行检查时，群众除贴大字报大鸣大放批评干部的思想作风错误外，还提出了近千条建议，帮助社队干部改进工作。有的群众还主动向干部检举个别落后群众的违法行为。在雨后的补苗点种时，全乡70％的人家关门下地。由于辅助劳力积极劳动，全乡劳动力的出勤率，已由原来的80％上升到125％。多数生产队根据群众意见实行了小段包工后，偷懒窝工的现象也大大减少了。
