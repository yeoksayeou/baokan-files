Everyone Uses Their Hands and Mouth
Various Regions Actively Promote Mandarin Chinese

    (Our report) Jinan - Shandong, Hunan, Shanghai and other regions are actively carrying out the work of promoting the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese. In Qingdao City, Shandong Province, before the "May Day" holiday, all teachers in the city learned the phonetic alphabet and used it to teach Mandarin Chinese. All teachers and students of Shunxing Road Elementary School in the city also held an on-site Mandarin Chinese meeting and launched a competition. The school also held parent meetings or conducted home visits to win the support of parents and the community for this work.
    In addition to Qingdao City, more than ten counties and cities in Shandong Province, such as Yantai, Laiyang, Jining, and Tai'an, are also promoting Mandarin Chinese. For example, all teachers, students, and staff of Laiyang Normal School have made specific plans for a great leap forward in learning Mandarin Chinese.
    The Party and government of Longhui County in Hunan Province attach great importance to the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese. The county party committee and the county people's committee issued a mobilization order to all teachers in the county to promote Mandarin Chinese vigorously on the basis of the victory of the rectification and "double opposition" movement, creating an atmosphere where everyone uses their hands and mouths, and speaks Mandarin Chinese in both teaching and daily life.
    Shanghai is also taking the lead in promoting Mandarin Chinese. All secondary and primary school educators in the city have also made a guarantee: to learn Mandarin Chinese within six months and master it within one year. They also guarantee to provide make-up lessons on the phonetic alphabet for high school, junior high school, and primary school graduates before the summer vacation; starting from the next semester, all schools in the city will use Mandarin Chinese for teaching in all subjects. In addition, they also put forward a socialist competition initiative to teachers in secondary and primary schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangzhou to learn and promote Mandarin Chinese.
    At present, Fujian, Hubei, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces are actively preparing for provincial-level observation meetings on Mandarin Chinese teaching achievements, and will widely publicize and vigorously promote Mandarin Chinese.

    人人动手　个个动口
    各地积极推广普通话工作
    本报讯　山东、湖南、上海等地积极开展推行拼音字母和推广普通话工作。山东省的青岛市，在“五一”节的前夕，全市教师都学会了拼音字母、并运用拼音字母进行教学普通话。该市顺兴路小学全体师生还召开了普通话现场会议，展开了竞赛活动。该校还召开了家长座谈会或进行了家庭访问，争取家长和社会群众支持这项工作。
    山东省除青岛市外，还有烟台、莱阳、济宁、泰安等十余县市，也在推广普通话。像莱阳师范学校全体师生员工每人都订了学习普通话大跃进的具体规划。
    湖南隆回县党、政非常重视推广普通话工作。县委会和县人民委员会向全县教师发出推广普通话的动员令：要求各级学校在整风、双反运动胜利的基础上，大张旗鼓地推广普通话，造成人人动手、个个动口，无论在教学和日常生活中都说普通话的风气。
    上海市在推广普通话工作上也是一马当先。该市中等、初等全体教育工作者也提出保证：要在半年内学会普通话，一年内学好普通话。并保证在暑假前给高中、初中、小学的毕业生做好拼音字母的补课工作；从下学期起，全市学校各科都用普通话进行教学。此外，他们还向江苏省、浙江省、广州市中等初等学校教师提出学习和推广普通话的社会主义竞赛倡议书。
    目前福建、湖北、陕西、浙江、山东、河北等省都在积极筹办全省普通话教学成绩观摩会，并将广泛宣传，大力推广普通话。
