    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Major General Kang Sang-ho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, wrote a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 24th regarding the second group of the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea.

    The letter stated that, according to the second withdrawal plan formulated based on the statement issued by the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on February 20, 1958, concerning the decision to withdraw all Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, 100,000 Chinese People's Volunteers would withdraw from Korea through Sinuiju during the period from July 11 to August 20, 1958.

    The letter also stated that if the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission sends inspection teams to conduct inspections, the Korean-Chinese side will take appropriate steps.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: At today's meeting of the secretaries of the Military Armistice Commission, the Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side regarding the incident of the U.S. side once again dispatching special agents to illegally cross the military demarcation line on June 17 to carry out hostile activities.

    It has been previously reported that the joint investigation conducted by both sides of the Second Joint Observer Team of the Military Armistice Commission on June 19 and 20 has fully confirmed this incident.

    The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out at the meeting that the U.S. special agent, An Sang-jin, captured by the Korean-Chinese side's civil police, was originally a fisherman from northern Korea. He and his five companions were fishing off the coast of Haeju on August 5 last year when they and their fishing boat were hijacked to South Korea by U.S. armed vessels, and the captain of the fishing boat was killed. After this incident occurred, the Korean-Chinese side lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side at the Secretary-General's meeting held on August 8 last year, and strongly demanded that the U.S. side immediately return the fishermen, including An Sang-jin, and the fishing boat hijacked to South Korea to the Korean side. However, the U.S. side denied the occurrence of this incident at subsequent Secretary-General's meetings. On the other hand, they forced An Sang-jin and others to tell South Korean reporters that they had "voluntarily come to South Korea," and then forcibly subjected An Sang-jin and others to special agent training and dispatched them to illegally cross the military demarcation line to carry out hostile activities against the Korean-Chinese side.

    The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that in the past, U.S. armed vessels have repeatedly invaded the east and west coastal areas of northern Korea, killing and abducting peaceful fishermen and residents. However, when the Korean-Chinese side requested the U.S. side to return the hijacked fishermen and fishing boats to the Korean side, the U.S. side refused each time and denied these incidents. This incident exposed the U.S. side's lying behavior.

    The Korean-Chinese side lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side, demanding that the U.S. side immediately stop this behavior, severely punish the personnel involved, and strongly demanding that the U.S. side immediately return the other North Korean fishermen and fishing boats hijacked on August 5 last year, as well as all residents abducted by the U.S. side, to the Korean-Chinese side.

    The U.S. Secretary-General at the meeting continued to distort the facts and slander the Korean-Chinese side, attempting to deny its violation of the armistice agreement. The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side suggested that the captured U.S. special agent, An Sang-jin, be brought to the meeting for joint interrogation by both secretaries, but the U.S. side unreasonably refused.

    The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side finally pointed out that the above-mentioned violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side have been confirmed by the joint investigation conducted by both sides, and no matter what excuses and methods the U.S. side uses, it cannot deny its crimes.

    就第二批志愿军撤出朝鲜的事情
    朝中方面通知中立国监察委员会
    朝中方面秘书长抗议美方特务越界进行敌对活动
    新华社平壤25日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在24日就中国人民志愿军第二批撤离朝鲜这件事写信给中立国监察委员会。
    信上说，根据中国人民志愿军总部1958年2月20日发表的声明中关于中国人民志愿军官兵在1958年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜的决定而拟订的第二批撤退计划，中国人民志愿军十万人将在1958年7月11日到8月20日这段期间内经过新义州撤出朝鲜。
    信上还说，如果中立国监察委员会派出视察小组对此进行视察，朝中方面将采取适当的步骤。
    新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在今天举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长就6月17日美方又一次派遣特务非法越过军事分界线进行敌对行为这件事，向美方提出严重抗议。
    过去已经报道，军事停战委员会第二联合观察小组双方成员在6月19日和20日进行的共同调查，已经完全证实了这次事件。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出：这次被朝中方面民政警察捕获的美方特务安相珍原为朝鲜北部的渔民。他同他的五名同伴去年8月5日在海州沿海捕鱼时，连同渔船被美方武装船只劫往南朝鲜，渔船船长被杀害。这次事件发生以后，朝中方面曾经在去年8月8日举行的秘书长会议上向美方提出严重抗议，并且强硬要求美方立即把劫往南朝鲜的安相珍等渔民和渔船送还朝鲜方面。但是美方在以后的秘书长会议上却否认这件事的发生，另一方面又强迫安相珍等向南朝鲜记者说，他们是“自愿来到南朝鲜的”，然后又用暴力强迫安相珍等受特务训练，并且派遣他们非法越过军事分界线，向朝中方面进行敌对行为。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，过去美方武装船只曾经多次侵入朝鲜北部的东西沿海地区，杀害和劫持和平渔民和居民。但是当朝中方面要求美方把被劫持的渔民和渔船送还朝鲜方面时，美方每次都加以拒绝并对这些事件加以否认。这次事件暴露了美方的说谎行为。
    朝中方面向美方提出严重抗议，要求美方立即停止这种行为、严惩有关人员，并且强硬要求美方立即把去年8月5日劫去的其他朝鲜北部渔民和渔船以及所有被美方劫走的居民送还朝中方面。
    美方秘书长在会上仍旧颠倒是非，中伤朝中方面，企图否认它违反停战协定的行为。朝中方面秘书长建议把被捕的美方特务安相珍押来会场，由双方秘书长共同审讯，但是，美方又无理地加以拒绝。
    朝中方面秘书长最后指出，上述美方违反停战协定的行为已经由双方进行的共同调查证实了，不管美方用任何借口和方法也无法抵赖它的罪行。
