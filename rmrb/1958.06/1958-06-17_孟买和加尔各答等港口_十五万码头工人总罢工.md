Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th: Approximately 150,000 dockworkers in major Indian ports such as Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Visakhapatnam, and Cochin began a general strike from midnight today.

This strike has halted loading and unloading operations for at least 150 ships in these ports. About 90 ships are anchored and idle in Calcutta and Bombay alone. In Bombay, more than 5,000 dockworkers on the night shift have left the port.

The strike was launched by the All-India Port and Dock Workers Federation in support of the dockworkers' thirty-four demands. The dockworkers are demanding a uniform wage standard, overtime pay, a welfare fund, the abolition of the contract system, the implementation of a system for dismissing temporary workers, and improvements in leave and vacation regulations.

The All-India Port and Dock Workers Federation has held a series of talks with the Indian authorities to resolve the dockworkers' demands. Recently, the Federation also held negotiations in Bombay with the Indian Minister of Transport and Communications, Patil, and others. Due to the failure to reach an agreement, the Federation decided to hold a general strike starting on June 16.

The Indian authorities have taken measures in response to the dockworkers' strike. Earlier, the Bombay Dock Labour Board had declared the dockworkers' strike illegal. Army and naval personnel are on standby in Bombay, ready to take over port operations at any time. Madras and other ports have already been declared to be in a state of emergency. According to newspaper reports, similar steps will be taken in all other major ports across the country.

### 孟买和加尔各答等港口  十五万码头工人总罢工

    孟买和加尔各答等港口
    十五万码头工人总罢工
    新华社新德里16日电　在印度的孟买、加尔各答、马德拉斯、维萨卡帕特南和柯钦等主要港口约有十五万码头工人从今天上午零时起实行总罢工。
    这次罢工使这些港口至少有一百五十只船的装卸工作停顿了。在加尔各答和孟买就有约九十艘船抛锚不动。孟买已有五千多当夜班的码头工人离开了港口。
    这次罢工是全印港口和码头工人联合会为支持码头工人提出的三十四项要求而发动的。码头工人要求实行统一的工资标准、加班工资、福利基金、取消合同制度、实行解雇临时工人制度以及改进请假和休假规定等。
    全印港口和码头工人联合会曾经和印度当局举行了一系列的会谈，以解决码头工人的要求。最近联合会又同印度交通运输部长帕蒂尔等在孟买举行了谈判。由于没有达成协议，联合会才决定从6月16日起举行总罢工。
    印度当局对码头工人的罢工采取了措施。早些时候，孟买码头劳工委员会曾经宣布码头劳工罢工为非法。军队和海军人员在孟买待命，准备随时接管港口工作。马德拉斯等港口已经宣布处于紧急状态。据报纸消息说，在全国所有其他主要港口也将采取类似的步骤。
