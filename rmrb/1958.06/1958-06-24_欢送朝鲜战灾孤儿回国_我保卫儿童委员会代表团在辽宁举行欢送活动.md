The Korean war-stricken orphans in various places were very excited to hear that Delegation Head Shen Ziji had come all the way from Beijing to welcome them. They rushed to make paper flowers to welcome the delegation, wrote welcome slogans, and rehearsed song and dance performances. Wherever the delegation went, they were warmly welcomed by the children. As soon as the delegation came out of one dormitory, they were surrounded by students from other dormitories, all vying to invite Delegation Head Shen Ziji and the delegation members to sit with them and talk with their Chinese mothers and uncles.

The delegation concluded its farewell activities in various parts of Liaoning Province and returned to Shenyang on the evening of the 23rd.
