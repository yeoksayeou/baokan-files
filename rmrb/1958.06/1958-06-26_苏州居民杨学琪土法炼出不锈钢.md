    Suzhou Resident Yang Xueqi Uses Indigenous Methods to Produce Stainless Steel
    (Reported by our newspaper) Suzhou resident Yang Xueqi recently used an indigenous furnace to produce stainless steel. According to preliminary identification, this stainless steel can be used to manufacture tools such as calipers and medical equipment, and the cost per pound is only 20%-30% of that of imported goods.
    Stainless steel is made of four metals: chromium, manganese, nickel, and wrought iron. Among these, nickel, with a content of over 12%, is domestically produced in small quantities, is very expensive, and is difficult to purchase. While flipping through reference books, Yang Xueqi saw a book that introduced how the Soviet Union had reduced the nickel content to 0.6% in the production of stainless steel, which greatly inspired him. He decided to use manganese, which has the same effect, to replace nickel. Comrades from the street office and district people's committee also participated in this experiment to encourage him. They used ordinary white coal stoves and a small crucible, and the raw materials were added to this crucible. After burning for more than two hours, a pot of stainless steel was made. The steel bars initially taken from the sand mold were bluish-gray, but when polished on a grinding wheel, they immediately showed an attractive luster. They did not rust when immersed in salt water, and the hardness was also very good. The disadvantage was that it was brittle and had some magnetism. In response to these shortcomings, Yang Xueqi made some improvements, shortening the smelting time to one hour and twenty minutes. The stainless steel produced in this way had better toughness, could be drilled on a drilling machine, and had less magnetism. Salespersons at the hardware and electrical wholesale store believed it could be purchased and asked them to produce it quickly.
    Now, after the initial success of the experiment, Yang Xueqi, with the help of various parties, has set up a simple workshop, with a total of nine people engaged in production. They used stoves built from diesel drums and smelted the first pot of stainless steel on the 13th.

    苏州居民杨学琪土法炼出不锈钢
    本报讯　苏州市居民杨学琪最近用土炉子炼出了不锈钢。据初步鉴定，这种不锈钢可以制造卡钳等工具和医疗器械，每斤的成本只占进口货的20％—30％。
    不锈钢是用铬、锰、镍和熟铁四种金属炼成的，在其含量中12％以上的镍，由于国内产量少，价格非常贵，而且难以买到。杨学琪在翻参考书籍中，看到有一本书上介绍苏联炼不锈钢已把镍的含量降低到0.6％，受到很大启发。决定用增加作用相同的锰来代替镍。街道办事处、区人委一些同志也参加了这次试验，给他以鼓励。他们用的是普通白煤炉子，加上一个小坩埚，原料就加在这个坩埚里。经过燃烧二个多小时，一锅不锈钢炼好了。初从砂模里取出的钢条呈青灰色，可是上砂轮一打立即显出诱人的光亮，放在盐水中浸也不生锈，硬度也很好。缺点是发脆，并且还带有一些磁性。针对这些缺点，杨学琪又作了一些改进，使冶炼时间缩短到一小时二十多分钟。这样炼出来的不锈钢的韧性也好了，并且可以在钻床上钻眼，磁性也更加少了。五金交电批发商店营业员认为可以收购，并要他们赶快生产。
    现在，在试验初步成功后，杨学琪在各方面帮助下搞起了一个简易工场，共有九人在进行生产。他们用柴油桶砌的炉灶，在13日炼出了第一锅不锈钢。
