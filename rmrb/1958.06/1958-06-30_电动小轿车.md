    Electric Sedan
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. A beautifully designed and easy-to-drive electric sedan was successfully trial-produced on the 27th at the Shanghai Taxi Company's maintenance workshop.

    This electric sedan is very suitable for city driving. It is powered by a storage battery through a DC motor, and its speed can reach 40 kilometers per hour. Each charge of the battery can last for about four hours of driving. The electric sedan runs without any noise and does not emit exhaust fumes like ordinary cars, which is very beneficial for maintaining urban quiet and hygiene. It can seat four people and can drive on roads as narrow as two meters wide. The top is convertible, making it very cool to ride in during the summer.

    电动小轿车
    据新华社上海29日电　一种式样美观、驾驶简便的电动小轿车，27日在上海市出租汽车公司保修车间试制成功。
    这辆电动轿车很适宜在市内行驶。它是用蓄电池通过直流马达发动运转的，时速可达四十公里。蓄电池每充一次电，可以行驶四小时左右。电动轿车行驶起来没有一点声音，也不像普通汽车要排泄废臭气，对于保持城市安静和卫生有很大好处。车上能坐四个人，在两公尺宽的马路上就能行驶。车顶是敞篷的，夏天乘坐非常风凉。
