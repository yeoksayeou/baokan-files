    Research Achievements of the International Geophysical Year
    The International Geophysical Year has passed eleven months – two-thirds of its entire course. The vast majority of countries participating in this activity have conducted extensive research on geophysics according to a unified plan and have already achieved some results.

    Geophysical research includes thirteen aspects, which can be summarized into three main projects: research on the upper atmosphere and the cosmos; research on the Earth's thermal properties and hydrology, including weather and climate; and research on the internal structure of the Earth. These studies are mainly carried out using artificial satellites and the Antarctic region.

    According to data released by various countries, scientists have discovered a crack on the Earth's crust that is 45,000 miles long, 20 miles wide, and 1.5 miles deep, and its direction is consistent with the direction of earthquake zones on Earth. They have also obtained a method for measuring gravity from ships at sea.

    Scientists have discovered that the speed of air flow over the Arctic region reaches 335 miles per hour; discovered a very strong electric current on the ground after a solar explosion; and discovered previously unobserved phenomena using a new solar photography method, including huge gas vortices with diameters ranging from 200 to 600 miles. Soviet oceanographic research vessels conducted ocean measurements in the Pacific Ocean, reaching a depth of 35,948 feet. Huge explosions on the sun eject gases and atomic particles at a speed of 500 miles per second for hundreds of thousands of miles, and these explosions release energy equivalent to ten billion large hydrogen bombs in twenty minutes.

    In addition, in the Atlantic Ocean, scientists have discovered a new, slow-moving, oppositely flowing current deep below 4,500 feet of the Gulf Stream; and discovered mountains as high as 5,000 feet on the Arctic seabed.

    On September 17, 1957, scientists recorded -102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, an unprecedentedly low temperature. It has also been confirmed that the gas emitted from the sun's white light ring surrounds the entire solar system and reflects radio waves back to the ground from thousands of miles above. This gas layer is so thin that the temperature of its individual particles does not show thermal effects.

    国际地球物理年取得研究成果
    国际地球物理年已经过了十一个多月——全部历程的三分之二了。参加这项活动的各国绝大多数都按照统一计划对地球物理进行了广泛的研究，并且已经取得了一些成果。
    地球物理研究包括十三个方面，可归纳成三个主要项目：大气高层和宇宙的研究；地球的热性质和水文情况的研究，其中包括天气和气候；地球内部构造的研究。这些研究主要是利用人造地球卫星和南极地带进行的。
    根据各国公布的资料，科学家们发现地壳上出现长四万五千哩、宽二十哩、深一点五哩的裂缝，它的方向和地球上的地震区方向一致；还获得了在海面上从船上测量重力的方法。
    科学家们发现了在北极地带上空的空气流动速度每小时达三百三十五哩；发现了太阳上发生爆炸以后在地面上出现强度很大的电流；用新的太阳拍摄法发现了以前从没观察到的现象，包括直径从二百到六百哩的巨大气体涡流。苏联海洋学研究船在太平洋进行了海洋测量，达到三万五千九百四十八呎的深度。太阳上的巨大爆炸把气体和原子微粒以每秒五百哩的速度抛出几十万哩，这种爆炸在二十分钟内放出相当于十亿个大型氢弹所含的能量。
    此外，在大西洋中，在哥利佛特尔海流四千五百呎以下的深处，科学家们发现了一股新的流动缓慢、向相反方向流动的海流；发现了在北极的海洋底上有高五千呎的山脉。
    1957年9月17日科学家们曾经记录下来华氏零下102.7度，这是空前未有的低温度。还证实了从太阳的白光环中散发出来的气体笼罩着整个太阳系，并从几千哩的高空把无线电波反映到地面上。这种气体层非常薄，以致它的个别粒子的温度不显示出热影响。
