Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: The Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement yesterday thoroughly exposing the nature of the replies made by Nobusuke Kishi and his cabinet members in the Diet to the questions raised by Socialist Party members regarding Japan-China relations. The statement also demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its fundamental attitude of hostility towards China.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese people's call for eliminating the current tension between Japan and China is growing louder. However, despite this, the Kishi Nobusuke government still adheres to a "wait-and-see" attitude and has no intention of resolving this issue, which is regrettable.

The statement strongly criticized the government officials headed by Nobusuke Kishi for their replies on the Japan-China issue at the recent Diet sessions. It stated that they not only showed no remorse for the strained relations between Japan and China caused by them, but also attempted to shift the responsibility to the Chinese side, insisting that the tension was caused by China's "misunderstanding." Moreover, they continue to help create the "Two Chinas" conspiracy.

The statement refuted, point by point, the absurd fallacies recently spread by Nobusuke Kishi and others, and pointed out that the intention behind their words is completely contrary to the Japanese people's urgent desire to eliminate the tension between Japan and China as soon as possible.

The statement pointed out the responsibility of the Japanese government for launching the war of aggression against China in the past, which brought enormous disasters to the Chinese people, and also criticized the Kishi Nobusuke government's irresponsible attitude towards resolving the Liu Lianren incident.

The statement also called on the Japanese people to launch a national movement demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its attitude of hostility towards China, and actively seek to restore friendly relations between the people of Japan and China in the spirit of friendship, peace, equality and mutual benefit, so as to strive for the full implementation of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement.

    日中友协发表声明
    抨击岸政府敌视中国
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会昨天发表一项声明，彻底揭露岸信介和他的阁员最近在国会对社会党议员提出的关于日中关系问题的质询所做的答复的本质，并且要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的基本态度。
    声明指出，日本人民要求消除目前日中两国的紧张关系的呼声正越来越响亮，但是尽管这样，岸信介政府仍然坚持着“静观”的态度，完全无意解决这个问题，这是令人遗憾的。
    声明强烈指责说，以岸信介为首的政府负责人在最近的国会会议上就日中问题所作出的答复，表明了他们对于自己造成的日中关系的紧张状态不仅完全没有悔悟的表示，相反地还企图把责任转嫁给中国方面，硬说招致紧张状态的原因是由于中国的“误会”，而且他们还继续帮助制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    声明逐点驳斥了最近由岸信介等人散布的荒唐无稽的谬论，并且指出他们所讲的话的意图是同日本人民要求尽速消除日中两国紧张关系的迫切愿望完全相反的。
    声明指出了日本政府过去对中国发动侵略战争、给中国人民招致莫大灾难所应负的责任，并且指责岸信介政府对解决刘连仁事件所表现的不负责任的态度。
    声明同时号召日本人民展开国民运动要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的态度，并且以友好和平等互利的精神积极谋求恢复日中两国人民的友好关系，以争取完全实施第四次日中贸易协定。
