    Deeply Moved
    After reading General Wang Zhen's letter to Comrade Xu Xiangguo and Comrade Guo Xiaochuan's article "On 'Never Putting Down the Gun'" on the eighth page on May 26th, I was deeply moved. I am moved not only because Comrade Xu Xiangguo's "Never Putting Down the Gun" is a good poem, full of the revolutionary style of the People's Liberation Army; but also because our general attaches so much importance to the creations of soldiers, and can breathe and sing with ordinary soldiers.
    A few days later, I saw Marshal Chen Yi's "Children's Poems" for children on the fourth page on June 1st. Although I can't explain the reasons for the goodness of the poems, the mere fact that our Marshal can write poems for children moves me deeply. I recited it to my children, and they were all happy.

    很受感动
    读了5月26日八版上王震将军写给徐先国同志的一封信和郭小川同志“关于‘永不放下枪’”一文后，我深受感动。我所以感动，不仅因为徐先国同志写的“永不放下枪”是一首好诗，充满了人民解放军的革命风格；更因为我们的将军如此重视战士的创作，能和普通战士同呼吸共歌唱。
    过了几天，我又在6月1日第四版看到了陈毅元帅为孩子们写的“儿童篇”。我虽然对诗的好坏说不出个道理来，但是单是我们的元帅能给孩子们写诗这一点就使我感动极了。我把它朗诵给我的孩子听，他们也都感到高兴。
