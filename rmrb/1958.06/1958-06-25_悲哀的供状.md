    A Sorrowful Confession
    On the 23rd of this month, Dulles, in a meeting with a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter, arrogantly stated that to "improve" East-West relations, it was necessary to enable "forces operating within the Soviet bloc" to change the policies of socialist countries. Dulles's so-called "forces operating within the Soviet bloc" referred to nothing other than counter-revolutionary criminals like Nagy. Therefore, what Dulles proclaimed was not a desire to "improve" East-West relations, but merely the American dream of subverting socialist countries.
    However, this arrogant dream is impossible to realize. The counter-revolutionary undertaking of the Nagy group, to which Dulles pinned his hopes, not only suffered a shameful defeat but also resulted in a death sentence. Therefore, Dulles could not help but sigh and admit that the "possibility is small" of using counter-revolutionary dregs like Nagy to realize the plot of subverting socialist countries.
    Thus, Dulles's arrogant clamor is actually a sorrowful confession by imperialists who cannot shake socialist countries.

    悲哀的供状
    本月23日杜勒斯接见加拿大广播公司记者时竟狂妄地说，要“改善”东西方关系就必须使“在苏联集团内部起作用的力量”来改变社会主义国家的政策。杜勒斯的所谓“在苏联集团内部起作用的力量”并不是其他，而是指纳吉之类的反革命罪犯而言。所以，杜勒斯所宣告的并不是什么“改善”东西方关系的愿望，而不过是美国企图颠覆社会主义国家的梦想而已。
    然而，这种狂妄的梦想是无法实现的。杜勒斯所寄予希望的纳吉集团的反革命事业不但遭到了可耻的失败，并且被判处了死刑。所以，杜勒斯也不能不慨叹地承认，利用纳吉之类的反革命渣滓来实现颠覆社会主义国家的阴谋，其“可能性是很小的”。
    因而，杜勒斯的狂妄的叫嚣，实际上是帝国主义分子无法动摇社会主义国家的一种悲哀的供状而已。
