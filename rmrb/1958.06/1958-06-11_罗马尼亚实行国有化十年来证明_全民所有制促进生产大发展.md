Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 10th: This is a report from our correspondent Ding Man: June 11th marks the tenth anniversary of nationalization in Romania. The achievements of Romania's construction over the past decade prove that the public ownership of basic means of production greatly promotes the development of productive forces. The absurd argument of modern revisionists that public ownership is not as good as collective ownership or even individual ownership is completely untenable.

Ten years ago, the Romanian Grand National Assembly passed the draft nationalization law formulated by the Romanian Workers' Party. According to the decree, Romania nationalized large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises, as well as postal and telecommunications, transportation, banking, foreign trade, and insurance sectors.

After the implementation of nationalization, Romania's industrial production developed rapidly. By 1957, the output of the petroleum industry had increased to 268% of that in 1948, the electricity industry to 473%, the machinery manufacturing industry to 782%, the chemical industry to 669%, and the textile industry to 345%. Compared with 1938, the year with the highest pre-liberation output, the output of the steel industry increased 2.4 times in 1957, natural gas extraction increased 14 times, and the output of building materials increased 8 times.

Before 1948, the development of Romania's national economy was severely hindered by the sabotage and resistance of the bourgeoisie, who held a large amount of economic power. The reason why Romanian industry was able to develop rapidly after the implementation of nationalization is that public ownership eliminated the basic contradiction inherent in capitalism between the social nature of production and the private capitalist form of ownership, creating conditions for the planned development of the national economy.

Romania implemented a one-year plan for economic development from 1949 to 1950, and the first five-year plan from 1951 to 1955. The second five-year plan from 1956 to 1960 and the ten-year electrification plan from 1951 to 1960 are currently being implemented.

Due to the planned development of the national economy, as early as the end of the first five-year plan, the proportion of socialist components in industry, finance, and foreign trade had reached or nearly reached 100%. It reached more than 90% in the transportation industry and more than 80% in domestic commerce. In agriculture, by March of this year, the land owned by socialist agriculture had also accounted for 52.4% of the total agricultural land in the country.

The implementation of public ownership of the means of production eliminated the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man in state-owned enterprises. The working people realized that they were the true masters of the country, and their attitude towards labor and public property underwent a fundamental change. The enthusiasm and creativity of workers, engineers, and staff in state-owned enterprises soared to unprecedented heights. Socialist labor competitions to increase output and quality, reduce costs, and save raw materials have been launched among workers time and time again. They had completed the industrial gross output plan of the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.

The lives of the working people have improved significantly in recent years. During the first five-year plan, the real wages of workers increased by 28%. During the second five-year plan, real wages will increase by another 30%, and 2.5 million square meters of housing will be built.

### 罗马尼亚实行国有化十年来证明  全民所有制促进生产大发展

    罗马尼亚实行国有化十年来证明
    全民所有制促进生产大发展
    据新华社布加勒斯特10日电  本社记者丁曼报道：6月11日是罗马尼亚实行国有化的十周年纪念日。罗马尼亚十年来的建设成就证明，基本生产资料的全民所有制大大促进了生产力的发展，而现代修正主义者宣扬的全民所有制不如集体所有制、甚至不如个体所有制优越的荒谬论点，是完全站不住脚的。
    十年前，罗马尼亚大国民议会通过了罗马尼亚工人党所拟定的国有化法令草案。根据法令，罗马尼亚把大、中工矿企业以及邮电、运输、银行、对外贸易、保险事业等部门收归国有。
    在实行国有化以后，罗马尼亚的工业生产有了迅速的发展。到1957年，石油工业产量已经增加为1948年的268％，电力工业增加为473％，机器制造业增加为782％，化学工业增加为669％，纺织工业增加为345％。同解放前年产量最高的1938年相比，1957年钢铁工业的产量增加了二点四倍，天然气开采量增加了十四倍，建筑材料的产量增加了八倍。
    在1948年以前，由于握有大量经济命脉的资产阶级的破坏和反抗，罗马尼亚国民经济的发展受到了严重的阻碍。罗马尼亚工业在实行国有化以后之所以能够迅速发展，是因为全民所有制消除了生产的社会性和私人资本主义占有形式之间的这一资本主义所具有的基本矛盾，为国民经济的有计划的发展创造了条件。
    罗马尼亚在1949年到1950年实行了发展经济的一年计划，1951年到1955年实行了第一个五年计划。目前正在执行着1956年到1960年的第二个五年计划和1951年到1960年的十年电气化计划。
    由于国民经济的有计划的发展，早在第一个五年计划结束时，社会主义成分的比重在工业、金融和对外贸易中已达到或几乎达到百分之百。在运输业中达到90％以上，在国内商业中达到80％以上。在农业中，到今年3月份，社会主义农业拥有的土地也已经占全国农业土地总面积的52.4％。
    实行生产资料的全民所有制就在国有化企业中消灭了人剥削人的现象，劳动人民认识到他们是国家的真正主人，他们对劳动、对公共财产的态度发生了根本的转变。国有化企业中的工人、工程师和职员的劳动积极性和创造性空前高涨。在工人中一次又一次地展开着提高产量和质量、降低成本和节约原料的社会主义劳动竞赛。他们曾经提前完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产量计划。
    劳动人民的生活这些年来有了显著的改善。在第一个五年计划期间，工人的实际工资提高了28％。在第二个五年计划期间，实际工资将再增加30％，并且将建筑二百五十万平方公尺的住宅。
