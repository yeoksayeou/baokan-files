Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 3rd: The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant is manufacturing China's first domestically designed medium-sized steel rolling equipment. The main component of this set of steel rolling equipment, the primary rolling mill, was successfully trial-produced on June 1st, two months ahead of schedule. Technical evaluations have determined that it fully meets the design requirements.

This set of steel rolling equipment was designed by the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant itself and manufactured with the cooperation of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant and the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Plant. The complete set of equipment consists of fifty-six sets of machines, including a primary rolling mill, a medium rolling mill, and a hot shear, weighing a total of two thousand tons. From the loading of steel ingots into the heating furnace to the final rolling into steel billets, the entire production process is mechanized. On the 240-meter-long rolling line, there are only seven control consoles, controlled by fourteen workers who use buttons and levers to carry out streamlined production. It can roll 800,000 tons of steel ingots into steel billets annually, suitable for the needs of medium-sized iron and steel industrial enterprises. (Picture attached)

　　全套轧钢设备正在制造
    新华社沈阳3日电  沈阳重型机器厂正在制造我国第一套自行设计的中型轧钢设备。这套轧钢设备的主体初轧机，已在6月1日提前两个月试制成功，经过技术鉴定认为完全达到设计要求。
    这套轧钢设备是由沈阳重型机器厂自行设计、在太原矿山机器厂和大连工矿车辆厂配合下制造的。全套设备由初轧机、中轧机、热剪机等五十六组机器组成，总重达两千吨。从钢锭装入加热炉开始，一直到最后轧制成钢坯，全部生产都是机械化，在长二百四十公尺的轧制线上，只设有七个操纵台，由十四名工人控制电钮和闸把，就能进行流水式的生产。每年能把八十万吨钢锭轧成钢坯，适合中型钢铁工业企业的需要。（附图片）
