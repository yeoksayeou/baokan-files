Further Liberate Women's Labor Force to Serve Socialist Construction with Greater, Faster, Better and More Economical Results
Cao Guanqun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation

Women are a Great Human Resource

In 1955, Chairman Mao pointed out in the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" the inevitable trend of labor shortages after cooperativization and the great significance of mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the labor front. Chairman Mao said, "For many places, the scale of production has increased, the number of business departments has increased, the scope of labor has expanded to the breadth and depth of nature, and the work has become more refined, so labor will feel insufficient. This situation is only beginning now and will develop year by year in the future. This will also be the case after agricultural mechanization. In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that have never been imagined by people, several times, ten times, or even dozens of times higher yields of crops than now. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange businesses is even more unimaginable by predecessors. The same is true for science, culture, education, health, and other undertakings." Therefore, Chairman Mao pointed out, "Chinese women are a great human resource. We must tap this resource and strive to build a great socialist country." The facts in the great leap forward production upsurge of last winter and this spring have increasingly clearly confirmed Chairman Mao's profound prediction.

Under the leadership of the Party, and after socialist education and the nationwide rectification movement, women's labor force has been greatly liberated in the great leap forward in production last winter and this spring. The specific manifestations are: high attendance rate, frequent attendance, wide range of labor, and a spirit of bold creation and innovation. The general attendance rate of women in various places accounts for about 90% of the female labor force, and the number of workdays made is generally several times or even more than ten times higher than in the past. In the battle to harness mountains and rivers and conquer poor mountains and evil waters, the number of women participating accounts for 30% to 40% of the total labor force. Women's canals, women's ponds, March 8th reservoirs, March 8th forests...etc. can be found everywhere in various provinces and counties. The task of accumulating fertilizer is mostly undertaken by women. Women complete 60% to 80% of the tasks of wheat and cotton field management. Women have also actively participated in the agricultural tool reform movement, creating and improving tens of thousands of agricultural tools, and have learned many new farming techniques. According to statistics from Lushan County, Henan Province, in the past three months or so, women in the county have reformed 171 kinds of agricultural tools, furniture, etc., totaling more than 30,000 pieces. In Jiangkou County, Guizhou Province, more than 5,000 women have learned to use double-wheeled double-share plows this spring, accounting for more than half of all double-wheeled double-share plow farmers. A large number of labor models and production experts have emerged among women in various places, many of whom are well-known in their villages, and even creators of high-yield records that are famous throughout the country. For example, Peng Xueying, a female commune member from Zhaoyang County, Hubei Province, created the national highest record of 2,400 jin per mu for single-season rice yield; Lin Shuying, a female commune member from Luotian County, Hubei Province, created the national highest record of 121 jin and 6 liang of cocoons per silkworm paper; Zhang Qiuxiang from Weinan, Shaanxi Province, created the record of producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu in a large area for three consecutive years, etc. The public's perception of women is no longer just "capable and useful," but is widely spreading the praise: "Women are not simple, their will is as good as Liu Hulan and Zhao Yiman, their courage is better than Mu Guiying and Hua Mulan, and their wisdom is like Zhuge Liang and Luban." All this fully demonstrates that the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" has opened up broad prospects for the liberation of women's labor force, and also shows that women are already and will increasingly be an important labor force in production.

Women Still Have Great Potential to be Tapped

Due to the need for high-yield and high-acreage production, the expansion of agricultural capital construction, and the improvement of farming techniques, there is already a feeling of labor shortage. In the future, with the comprehensive development of local industries and other undertakings, this phenomenon of labor shortage will develop year by year. For example, Hunan Province needs about twice as many workdays in 1958 as in 1957. Even after increasing labor intensity and improving labor organization, there is still a labor deficit of 30% to 40%. In 1958, Shunjian Commune in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, wants to achieve a large-scale increase in grain production to 2,000 jin per mu, sugarcane to 20,000 jin per mu, and various capital constructions, it is estimated that each worker must do 500 workdays to complete the task.

According to the situation in various places, one of the important aspects of tapping labor potential is to tap the labor potential of women. Do women still have labor potential? The practice in advanced areas fully proves that there is great labor potential in women that can be tapped.

In summary, the most active ways to liberate women's labor in various places are: under the unified leadership of the Party, actively reform labor tools and reduce housework; actively help women improve production technology, rationally organize and use women's labor, and pay attention to women's labor protection; at the same time, it is also necessary to further guide women to liberate their minds and improve their communist consciousness. Many regions have already gained a lot of experience in these areas.

The mass tool reform movement in rural areas has played a significant role in improving women's labor efficiency, expanding the scope of women's labor, protecting women's labor, and reducing housework. For example, in Lushan County, Henan Province, women's labor efficiency has increased by eight times, ten times, or even thirty times due to the reform of tools in mountain and water management; some townships originally had 15% of women injured in labor, but now there are no casualties at all. The number of women participating in labor has also greatly increased. For example, before the improvement of tools in Xiaoercheng Commune, there were 307 men and women attending work; after the improvement of tools, there were 410 attending work, including auxiliary labor, each person averaging 28 workdays per month. Therefore, the county's entire task of mountain and water management can be completed three years ahead of schedule. Because of this, the county has established Zhuge Liang groups for women to study technology in various communes, trained tens of thousands of female technicians and various female agricultural tool operators, and vigorously mobilized and supported women to "find tricks in all directions and learn technology in every possible way."

Due to the needs of highly developed production, the issue of liberating women's labor is becoming increasingly urgent, and people are more aware that it is necessary to keep up with the development of socialist construction and reduce women's housework burden as much as possible. Many creations have already been made in this regard in various places, and the sprouts of many new things have emerged. For example, housework such as childcare, food processing, cooking, and sewing is gradually beginning to become a social collective undertaking. From these nascent things, a large liberation of women's labor can already be seen. For example, Hunan has a total of 6 million female laborers, about 4 million of whom have children, 30% of whom have no one to take care of. Solving this problem can add 63 million to 75 million workdays to the province, so the province wants to set up nursery groups in every township and commune. Mutual aid cooking or busy farming canteens can also greatly save manpower. For example, Shuikoujiang Agricultural Cooperative in Shaoyang has three major benefits after collective cooking in eight locations: (1) In the past, 105 households needed 105 people to cook, but now only eight people are needed to cook, saving more than 6,000 workdays per year; (2) More than 1,000 jin of grain and more than 10,000 dan of firewood can be saved; (3) Commune members eat hot meals every meal, are healthy, and get sick less often. The Henan Provincial Women's Federation is preparing to universally promote nursery groups, kindergartens, busy farming canteens, sewing groups, hand-cranked mills, etc. throughout the province to further liberate female labor. It is very necessary and possible to do this now. Among them, promoting the hand-cranked mill alone increases labor efficiency by more than ten times or even twenty times compared to the old mill, which can save more than one million female laborers to invest in production. According to a typical survey in Daye District, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, the use of sewing machines and flour mills alone can reduce women's housework by 40% to 50%.

Chairman Mao once pointed out: "Only when class society no longer exists, heavy labor is automated, and agriculture is also mechanized, can true equality between men and women be realized." Lenin also emphasized that women must be liberated from tedious housework. He called the establishment of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens the beginning of a great communist cause. He also pointed out that these ordinary tasks can actually truly liberate women and reduce and eliminate the phenomenon of their inequality with men in social production and social life. (See Lenin's "A Great Beginning")

Reports from various places show that the masses have "three satisfactions" and "three hearts" after "reforming tools and reducing housework." The "three satisfactions" are: women attend work frequently, labor efficiency is high, and they can smoothly complete production tasks, and the cooperative is satisfied; the intensity of labor is reduced, the working hours are reduced, and the health of women and children is protected, and female commune members are satisfied; household income is increased, and it is guaranteed that the whole family eats well and dresses well. The "three hearts" are that women "do not worry about their children, do not worry about pushing the mill at night and cooking during the day, and are at ease; they have time to participate in cultural and technical studies, recreational activities, and social activities, and are happy; they can increase income, can ride 'satellites' and 'rockets,' and can become models, and are happy." Many women also have such experiences in practice. They said: "If you want to improve labor efficiency, you must work skillfully; if you want to leap forward again, you must reduce housework; if you want complete equality between men and women, you must greatly improve labor tools."

Experience in various places proves that the more rationally labor is organized, the greater the role women play in production. Many facts in the Great Leap Forward show that women, especially young and middle-aged women, can do anything and do anything well. Those conservative views on the use of women's labor are incorrect. We must make full use of women's labor and give full play to women's labor efficiency. Only by mobilizing women to fight alongside men can our socialist construction cause be completed with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. At the same time, women are, after all, physiologically different from men, and appropriate care should be given to them in labor allocation during menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum, and lactation. The menstrual period badge, three adjustments and three non-adjustments (adjust dry but not wet during menstruation, adjust light but not heavy during pregnancy, adjust near but not far during lactation), and appropriate rest before and after childbirth that have been implemented in various places are all effective and good methods. In Daye District, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, under the leadership of the grassroots party committee, relying on the strength of the masses, and making the best use of local conditions, maternity hospitals were quickly established in every township, which has a significant effect on protecting women's health and enhancing women's physical strength, and also reduces the manpower required by farmers' families to take care of postpartum women, ensuring attendance. Some regions have also formed women into specialized groups or teams according to women's characteristics, which plays a good role in appropriately taking care of women's characteristics, giving full play to women's strengths, improving women's labor proficiency, and strengthening the planning of labor organization.

Promote the Ideological Liberation of Women

The liberation of women's labor force will never be achieved peacefully. It can only be achieved through the sharp struggle between the two roads in the countryside and the sharp struggle between advanced and backward ideas among the masses. The example of female commune leader Zhu Guoyun introduced in Comrade Shen Hanmin's article in Gugheng County, Hubei Province, published on page four of the People's Daily on May 16, and the growth of many other female labor models and advanced figures, all prove this. Women can only truly achieve ideological liberation by actively participating in this struggle under the leadership and support of the Party, breaking through all old rules and customs, and establishing a new communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to do.

Therefore, to further liberate women's labor force and give full play to the role of women, the issue of ideological liberation becomes a fundamental issue. In order to further promote the ideological liberation of women, in addition to continuing to guide women to break down the old ideological remnants of individualism, liberalism, and departmentalism, it is also necessary to support women to be liberated from various restraints and obstacles such as conservatism, inferiority, narrowness, and superstition.

According to the experience of advanced areas, the leadership must also overcome conservative ideas, firmly believe in the strength and wisdom of women, deeply and timely discover various advanced figures among women and their inventions; support their struggle to break through all conservative ideas, and pay attention to publicizing these new people, new things, and new styles among women. Some areas have truly played the effect of using points to lead the surface in promoting advanced figures. For example, in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, there is a model named Yan Taoxiang who loves the country, the society, and the family. The party committee summarized and promoted her deeds. In a few months, tens of thousands of Yan Taoxiangs appeared, inspiring and helping a wider range of women understand the correct relationship between individual interests and the interests of the collective and the state. Many local party committees believe that "as long as women have determination and perseverance, are willing to work hard and practically, they will not only not lag behind, but women can do anything, will do anything, and do everything well. Women are an amazing force. Many production and construction projects cannot be completed without the participation of women; as long as women participate, they will be done faster, more, better, and more economically."

According to the experience of advanced areas, all relevant units are also required to strengthen ideological education for women under the unified leadership of the party committee, encourage women's confidence and perseverance in striving for the upstream; help women overcome ideological conservatism and inferiority; support women to participate in various learning activities and improve their political, cultural, and technical levels; and pay attention to women's ideological trends at any time, study and solve the problems and practical difficulties among them. Countless facts in the Great Leap Forward prove that only by liberating women ideologically can women generate endless power.

It can be seen that liberating women's labor force has great significance for building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; at the same time, it also helps to gradually eliminate the differences between men and women in culture, technology, knowledge, talent, and actual social status, and achieve complete equality between men and women. We must abide by the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, strive to tap this great human resource of women, and strive to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    进一步解放妇女劳动力  为多快好省地建设社会主义服务
    全国妇联书记处书记　曹冠群
    妇女是一支伟大的人力资源
    一九五五年毛主席就在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中指出了在合作化以后劳力不足的必然趋势，指出了发动广大妇女参加到劳动战线上去的重大意义。毛主席说：“对于很多地方说来，生产的规模大了，经营的部门多了，劳动的范围向自然界的广度和深度扩张了，工作作得精致了，劳动力就会感到不足。这种情形，现在还只是在开始，将来会一年一年地发展起来。农业机械化以后也将是这样。将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。工业、交通和交换事业的发展，更是前人所不能设想的。科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业也是如此。”因此，毛主席指出：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”去冬今春生产大跃进高潮中的事实，日益明显地证实了毛主席这一深远的预见。
    在党的领导下，经过社会主义教育和全民整风运动，去冬今春的生产大跃进中，妇女劳动力已经获得了很大的解放。具体表现是：出勤率高、出勤经常、劳动范围广、有大胆创造革新的精神。各地妇女出勤的一般占女劳力的百分之九十左右，所作劳动日一般都比过去提高几倍以至十几倍，在兴修水利制服穷山恶水的战斗中，妇女参加的人数占全部劳力的百分之三十到百分之四十。妇女渠、妇女塘、三八水库、三八林……等等，各省各县到处都是。积肥的任务大部分是由妇女承担的。麦田、棉田管理的任务百分之六十——八十是由妇女完成的。妇女们也积极参加了农具改革运动，创造改良了千万件农具，并学会了许多新的耕作技术。据河南鲁山县统计，近三个多月来，全县妇女改革的农具、家具等就有一百七十一种，三万多件。贵州省江口县今春学会使用双轮双铧犁的妇女达五千余人，占全部双轮双铧
  犁农具手的半数以上。各地妇女中涌现了大批劳动模范、生产能手，其中不少闻名乡里，甚至是誉满全国的高额丰产创造者。如湖北省枣阳县女社员彭学应创造了亩产单季水稻二千四百斤的全国最高纪录，该省罗田县女社员林淑英创造了每张蚕纸产茧一百二十一斤六两的全国最高纪录，陕西渭南张秋香创造了连续三年大面积亩产籽棉千斤的纪录等等。社会上对妇女的观感已经不只是“能行、顶事”，而是广泛地传颂着：“妇女不简单，意志好比刘胡兰、赵一曼，勇敢赛过穆桂英、花木兰，智谋有如诸葛亮和鲁班。”这一切充分说明了“鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线为妇女劳力的解放开辟了广阔的前途，也说明了妇女在生产上已经是而且越来越会是一支重要的劳动大军。
    妇女还有巨大潜力可以挖掘
    由于大面积高额丰产的需要，农业基本建设规模的扩大，耕作技术的改进，已经感到劳力不足，今后随着地方工业和其他各项事业的全面发展，这种劳力不足的现象还会一年一年的发展起来。如湖南一九五八年全省所需劳动日比一九五七年增多约二倍多，增加劳动强度、改进劳动组织之后，也还有百分之三十——四十的劳动赤字。四川省内江县顺江社一九五八年要实现今年粮食双千斤、甘蔗双万斤的大面积增产和各种基本建设，预计每个劳动力要作五百个劳动日才能完成任务。
    根据各地情况来看，挖掘劳动潜力的重要方面之一，就是挖掘妇女劳动潜力。到底妇女还有没有劳动潜力？通过先进地区的实践，充分证明在妇女方面是有很大劳动潜力可以挖掘的。
    综合起来说，各地解放妇女劳力的最积极的途径是：在党的统一领导下，积极改革劳动工具，减轻家务劳动；积极帮助妇女提高生产技术，合理组织使用妇女劳力，并注意妇女的劳动保护；同时还必须进一步引导妇女思想解放，提高共产主义觉悟。不少地区在这些方面已经取得了很多的经验。
    农村群众性的工具改革运动，对于提高妇女劳动效率、扩大妇女劳动范围、保护妇女劳力、减轻家务劳动都起了重大的作用。如河南鲁山县在治山治水中，由于改革了工具，妇女劳动效率提高了八倍、十倍甚至三十倍；有的乡原来曾有百分之十五的妇女在劳动中受伤，现在完全没有伤亡事故了。参加劳动的妇女也大大增加，如小尔城社没有改良工具前男女出勤共三百零七人，改良工具后，出勤四百一十人，包括辅助劳力在内，每人每月平均作二十八个劳动日。因而全县治山治水的全部任务能提前三年完成。正因为如此，所以该县已在各社成立了妇女钻研技术的诸葛亮小组，训练了数以万计的女技术员和各种女农具手，大力动员和支持妇女“四面八方找窍门，千方百计学技术”。
    由于生产高度发展的需要，解放妇女劳力的问题日益迫切，人们更加认识到必须紧跟着社会主义建设事业的发展，尽可能地减轻妇女的家务负担。现在各地在这方面已经有了很多创造，出现了不少新鲜事物的萌芽。如把儿童教养、粮食加工、做饭、缝衣等等家务劳动逐渐开始变成社会集体的事业。从这些萌芽状态的事物中，已经可以看到妇女劳动力的大量解放。如湖南共有六百万女劳力，约有四百万是有小孩的，其中百分之三十的小孩无人照顾，解决了这一问题，全省可多作六千三百万至七千五百万个劳动日，所以该省要乡乡、社社办托儿组。互助做饭或农忙食堂，也可以大大节省人力。如邵阳水口江农业社，分八处集体做饭后有三大好处：（1）过去一百零五户要一百零五人做饭，现在只要八人做饭，全年可节省劳动日六千多个；（2）可节省粮食一千多斤，烧柴一万多担；（3）社员餐餐吃热饭，身体健康，少生病。河南省妇联准备在全省普遍推广托儿组、幼儿园、农忙食堂、缝纫组、手摇磨等来进一步解放女劳力。现在这样作是十分需要而且可能的。其中推广手摇磨一项，比旧磨提高劳动效率十多倍以至二十多倍，可以节省出一百多万女劳力投入生产。据该省登封县大冶区典型调查：采用缝纫机和磨面机两项，就可减轻妇女家务劳动百分之四十到百分之五十。
    毛主席曾经指出：“只有当阶级社会不存在了，笨重的劳动都自动化，农业也都机械化了的时候，才能真正实现男女平等。”列宁也曾强调指出，必须把妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来。他把公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的建立，称之为伟大的共产主义事业的开端。还指出：这些平凡的工作，实际上能够真正解放妇女，减少和消灭她们在社会生产和社会生活作用上处于与男子不平等的现象。（见列宁：“伟大的开端”一文）
    各地反映“改革工具、减轻家务劳动”以后群众有“三满意”、“三心”。“三满意”是：妇女出勤经常、劳动效率高，能顺利完成生产任务，合作社满意；减轻了劳动强度，减少了劳动时间，保护了妇儿健康，女社员满意；增加了家庭收入，保证了吃好、穿好全家满意。“三心”是妇女“不挂念孩子，不愁黑夜推磨、白天作饭，安心；有时间参加文化技术学习、文娱活动、社会活动，顺心；能增加收入，能坐‘卫星’‘火箭’，能得模范，开心。”许多妇女从实际中还有了这样的体验，她们说：“若要劳效提得高，就要干得巧，若要跃进再跃进，就要家务减得轻，若要男女完全都平等，就要劳动工具大改进。”
    各地经验证明，劳力组织得越合理，妇女在生产上起的作用就越大。大跃进中的许多事实说明，妇女，特别是青壮年妇女是什么也能干，什么也干得好的。那些在使用妇女劳力上的保守观点是不正确的，必须充分使用妇女劳力，发挥妇女的劳动效能。只有发动妇女与男子并肩作战，才能使我们的社会主义建设事业多快好省地完成。同时，妇女在生理上究竟与男子有所不同，对她们在经期、孕期、产后和哺乳期中，在劳动调配上还需要给予适当照顾。各地已经实行的月经挂牌、三调三不调（月经期调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳期调近不调远）和产前产后适当休息等制度，都是有效的好办法。河南省登封县大冶区，在基层党委的领导下，依靠群众的力量，因陋就简，很快就在乡乡办起了妇产院，对保护妇女健康、增强妇女体力有显著作用，并且减少了农民家庭照顾产妇所需的人力，保证了出勤。有的地区还按照妇女的特点，把妇女组成专业小组或专业队，对于适当照顾妇女的特点，发挥妇女的特长，提高妇女劳动的熟练程度，加强劳动组织的计划性，都起了良好的作用。
    促进妇女的思想解放
    妇女劳动力的解放，决不是和和平平就能达到目的的，它是经过农村两条道路的尖锐斗争，经过群众中先进思想与落后思想的尖锐斗争才能实现的。五月十六日人民日报四版登载的湖北省谷城县沈汉民同志的文章中介绍的女社长朱国蕴的事例，以及其他许多妇女劳动模范、先进人物的成长，都证明了这一点。妇女也只有在党的领导和支持下，积极参加这个斗争，冲破一切陈规旧习，树立敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的共产主义新风格，才能获得真正的思想解放。
    因此要进一步解放妇女的劳动力，要充分发挥妇女的作用，思想解放问题，就成为一个带根本性的问题。为了进一步促进妇女的思想解放，除了要继续引导妇女破除个人主义、自由主义、本位主义等旧的思想残余外，还要支持妇女从各种保守、自卑、狭隘、迷信等束缚和阻碍中获得解放。
    根据先进地区的经验，领导上也必须克服保守思想，坚信妇女的力量和智慧，深入地、及时地发现妇女当中的各种先进人物和她们的创造发明；支持她们冲破一切保守思想的斗争，并注意宣扬妇女中的这些新人、新事、新风格，有些地区在推广先进人物方面，真正发挥了以点带面的效果。如湖北孝感县有个爱国爱社爱家的模范晏桃香，党委总结和推广了她的事迹，在几个月内就出现了几万个晏桃香，启发和帮助了更广大的妇女懂得个人利益与集体、国家利益的正确关系。许多地区的党委都认为“妇女只要有决心、有毅力，肯苦干实干，不仅不落后，而且妇女什么都能干，什么都会干，什么都干得好。妇女是一支了不起的力量。在许许多多生产建设中没有妇女参加就办不成；只要有妇女群众参加，就会办得更快更多更好更省。”
    根据先进地区的经验，还要求各有关单位在党委统一领导下，加强对妇女的思想教育，鼓舞妇女力争上游的信心和毅力；帮助妇女克服思想上的保守和自卑；支持妇女参加各种学习活动，提高政治、文化、技术水平；并随时关心妇女的思想动向，研究解决其中的问题和妇女的实际困难。大跃进中无数的事实证明，只有使妇女获得思想解放，才能使妇女产生无穷无尽的力量。
    由此可见，解放妇女劳动力，对多快好省地建设社会主义具有重大的意义；同时，也有助于逐步地消灭男女在文化、技术、知识、才能和实际的社会地位等方面的差异，达到男女的完全平等。我们一定要遵照中央和毛主席的指示，努力发掘妇女这一支伟大的人力资源，为贯彻执行鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线而奋斗。
