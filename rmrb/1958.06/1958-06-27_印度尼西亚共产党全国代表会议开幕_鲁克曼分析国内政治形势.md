Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 26th: The National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) opened in Jakarta on June 25th. Deputy General Secretary Lukman, in his opening address, analyzed the domestic and international situation in Indonesia.

Lukman said that after the "Revolutionary Government" and "Charter of Overall Struggle" group's rebellion was basically crushed, the prestige of the Indonesian Communist Party and all progressive forces was soaring, because these forces were the most determined in pushing the government to destroy the rebel groups and helping the armed forces.

Lukman said that due to the failure of the terror and rebellion activities of the stubborn forces represented by the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, they have lost prestige among the people. Therefore, when it becomes difficult for them to continue as tools to attack progressive forces, the imperialists spare no effort to find tools that can be used to attack progressive forces. Lukman pointed out that the national bourgeoisie are not enemies of the Indonesian Communist Party, but its allies, and the Indonesian Communist Party will continue to cooperate with them. Imperialists and their comprador elements and landlords are still the enemies of the Indonesian people's struggle. Lukman said that the current national united front remains unchanged, and in the future, progressive forces will continue to be developed, intermediate forces united, and stubborn forces isolated.

Lukman pointed out: Indonesia's intermediate forces are not very firm in their attitude towards the rebel groups. He said that if the intermediate forces continue to turn to the right, even to the point of breaking away from the national united front, it will make our struggle more difficult. However, it is certain that if they do so, they will not only be abandoned by their masses, but will also be opposed by the entire people.

In analyzing the international situation, Lukman pointed out the influence of the statements issued by China and the Soviet Union warning the United States to stop interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and the fact that the socialist camp's advantage has increased after the Soviet Union launched its third artificial satellite.

The Indonesian Communist Party is holding a national congress to discuss preparations for the second general election scheduled for 1959 and issues related to education.

    印度尼西亚共产党全国代表会议开幕
    鲁克曼分析国内政治形势
    据新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚共产党全国代表会议25日在雅加达开幕。副总书记鲁克曼在致开幕词时分析了印度尼西亚的国内和国际局势。
    鲁克曼说，在基本上粉碎了“革命政府”和“全面斗争约章”集团的叛乱以后，印度尼西亚共产党和整个进步力量的威信蒸蒸日上，因为最坚决地推动政府摧毁叛乱集团和帮助武装部队的就是这些力量。
    鲁克曼说，由于以马斯友美党—印度尼西亚社会党为代表的顽固力量的恐怖和反叛活动遭到失败，他们在人民中间已经威信扫地。因此，当他们难以继续作为攻击进步力量的工具的时候，帝国主义者就不遗余力地来寻找能够用来进攻进步力量的工具。鲁克曼指出，民族资产阶级不是印度尼西亚共产党的敌人，而是它的盟友，印度尼西亚共产党将继续同他们合作。帝国主义者和他们的买办以及地主目前仍旧是印度尼西亚人民斗争的敌人。鲁克曼说，目前的民族统一阵线仍旧未变，今后将继续发展进步力量，团结中间力量，孤立顽固力量。
    鲁克曼指出：印度尼西亚的中间力量在对待叛乱集团的态度上不很坚定。他说，如果中间力量继续向右转，甚至于达到脱离民族统一阵线的程度，这会使我们的斗争更加困难，然而，可以肯定，如果他们这样做，他们不仅会被他们的群众所抛弃，而且还要遭到全体人民的反对。
    鲁克曼在分析国际局势时，指出中国和苏联发表的警告美国停止干涉印度尼西亚内政的声明的影响以及社会主义阵营在苏联发射第三颗人造卫星以后优势增强的事实。
    印度尼西亚共产党召开全国代表会议是为了讨论迎接定于1959年举行的第二次大选的准备工作问题和教育问题。
