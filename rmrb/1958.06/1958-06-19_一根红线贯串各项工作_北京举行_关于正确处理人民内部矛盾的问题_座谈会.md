Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Chairman Mao's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, like a red line, runs through all work, becoming the general program for the great rectification movement and the great leap forward in all aspects of work over the past year; its far-reaching influence will be even more brilliantly proven in future revolutionary practice. This was the common viewpoint at the Beijing symposium commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

The symposium was convened by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 17th. More than 50 people attended the symposium, including workers, professors, university presidents, political workers, and party secretaries from schools and districts.

Sun Yushan, a worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, after introducing the rectification movement in the plant and the tremendous changes it had brought about, said that more than one million big-character posters had adjusted the internal relations of the factory, making the relationship between leaders and the led, and between cadres and workers, closer and more united. On the basis of leading cadres regularly going down to the workshops to work alongside the workers, another method of combining mental and physical labor is now being developed, that is, cadres and workers teach and learn from each other. Cadres participate in physical labor, and workers also take time out to study and participate in enterprise management in addition to their physical labor. Workers and cadres are advancing side by side.

Shan Zhaoxiang, secretary of the Chaoyang District Committee of the Communist Party of China, demonstrated the great significance of the idea of correctly handling contradictions among the people in guiding practical work through the rural rectification movement in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. Under the guidance of this thought, they used the method of handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to repel the counterattacks against the socialist system by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements; they used the method of handling contradictions among the people to victoriously struggle against capitalist ideas and the capitalist road represented by well-to-do middle peasants; and finally, they "set fire to themselves," exposing and correcting the shortcomings and errors in the work style and ideological style of cadres through mass criticism and self-criticism. Cadres participated in labor, and adjusted the contradictions between cadres and the masses. After resolving these three types of contradictions, the peasants' revolutionary enthusiasm soared, and the peasants' spiritual outlook also underwent profound changes. At this time, contradictions often arose where the leadership lagged behind the masses. Shan Zhaoxiang examined his own thinking in connection with this and pointed out that under objectively favorable conditions, one should not be a slave to favorable conditions, but rather the master of favorable conditions.

Feng Ding, a professor at Peking University, gave a detailed account of the historical background of the publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and its connection with the general line for socialist construction. He believed that in this Marxist-Leninist work, Chairman Mao fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the people to build socialism. The proposal of the general line for socialist construction is a continued development of the ideas in this work after practice, actively bringing into play the subjective initiative of the 600 million people. He said that the combination of popularization and improvement, the combination of large, medium, and small, and the combination of leadership and the masses, will enable socialist construction to constantly break through "equilibrium" and exert extremely great strength among the 600 million people in these three combinations. The revolutionary practice at the present stage has only just begun to prove this work, and its outstanding foresight will become more and more apparent later on.

Fan Puquan, director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, said that 100,000 people on the reservoir construction site were of one mind, eating, living, and working together, giving cotton clothes when it was cold, raincoats when it rained, houses for accommodation, and helping each other in labor. Our leader Chairman Mao, the central authorities, and the responsible comrades of the party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, like ordinary people, have all carried out ordinary labor here. What kind of relationship is this? This is a communist relationship. However, even on this communist construction site, there are still contradictions among the people, sometimes manifested as contradictions between the advanced and the backward, and sometimes these contradictions are also stamped with the imprint of class. He cited many stories of repeatedly breaking quotas in the project as examples, pointing out that those who are conservative about quotas are often insiders, while those who break quotas are often outsiders. Insiders have made contributions, but the problem lies in putting politics in command; it is necessary to lead the people to break through conventions and continuously revolutionize.

Yang Shu, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: Chairman Mao's theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people comes from practice and guides practice. It runs through the thought of continuous revolution and the thought of fully mobilizing the masses to carry out socialist construction. Only by correctly resolving contradictions among the people can we fully mobilize the masses. The method of handling contradictions among the people has undergone new development after a year of practice. This is the method of using the mass line of "speaking out freely, airing views fully, holding great debates, and writing big-character posters" to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Practice has proved that the result of adopting this method is that a lively political situation has emerged among the people. Yang Shu also elaborated on the nature and handling methods of the two types of contradictions: contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people. He also proposed to break the concept of mystifying philosophy, and everyone should learn and use philosophy, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and apply dialectical materialism to practical work.

Also speaking at the symposium were Nie Zhen, Vice President of the Renmin University of China, Zhang Xu, Secretary of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Xuechu, Second Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Institute of Technology, Jia ?, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Petroleum Institute, and Ai Zhisheng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, and others. They all talked about their understanding of Chairman Mao's thesis in connection with the examples of handling contradictions among the people in their own units.

    一根红线贯串各项工作
    北京举行“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”座谈会
    新华社18日讯　毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论，像一根红线贯串着各项工作，成为过去一年伟大的整风运动和各方面工作大跃进的总纲；它的深远影响在未来的革命实践中将要得到更加光辉的证明。这是北京市纪念“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年座谈会上的共同观点。
    这个座谈会是中共北京市委宣传部在17日召开的。参加座谈会的有工人、教授、大学校长、政治工作者以及学校和区的党委书记等五十多人。
    石景山钢铁厂工人孙玉山在介绍了这个厂的整风运动和所引起的巨大变化以后说，一百多万张大字报，把工厂内部的关系调整好了，领导和被领导、干部和工人的关系更加亲密团结了。在领导干部定期下车间跟班生产的基础上，现在正在发展另一种脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的办法，即干部和工人互教互学，干部参加了体力劳动，工人除从事体力劳动外，也抽出时间学习和参加企业管理。工人和干部在并肩前进中。
    中共朝阳区委书记单昭祥通过北京东郊的农村整风运动，论证了正确处理人民内部矛盾这个思想在指导实际工作中的重大意义。他们在这个思想的指导下，用处理敌我矛盾的方法，击退了地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子向社会主义制度所进行的反扑；用处理人民内部矛盾的方法，和以富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想和资本主义道路胜利地进行了斗争；最后又“放火烧身”，通过群众性的批评和自我批评，揭发和纠正了干部工作作风和思想作风上的缺点和错误，干部参加了劳动，调整了干部和群众之间的矛盾。在解决了这三种矛盾以后，农民们的革命干劲即冲天而起，农民的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。在这个时候，又往往产生了领导落后于群众的矛盾。单昭祥联系自己的思想进行了检查，指出在客观有利的条件下，不要做有利条件的奴隶，要做有利条件的主人。
    北京大学教授冯定就“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表的时代背景和它同社会主义建设总路线的联系，作了详细的叙述。他认为毛主席在这篇马克思列宁主义的著作中，充分调动了人民群众建设社会主义的积极性。社会主义建设总路线的提出，就是这篇论著的思想经过实践以后的继续发展，它积极地发挥着六亿人民的主观能动性。他说，普及与提高相结合，大中小相结合，领导和群众相结合，六亿人民在这三个结合中，将使社会主义建设不断冲破“平衡”，发挥出极其伟大的力量。现阶段的革命实践给这篇论著所证明的还只是开始，越到后来将越会显露出它的卓越的远见。
    十三陵水库总指挥部政治部主任范普权说，水库工地上十万人一条心，同吃同住同劳动，天冷让棉衣，下雨让雨衣，住宿让房子，劳动中互相帮助。我们的领袖毛主席、中央和各省市自治区党委的负责同志，和普通人一样，都在这里进行了平凡的劳动。这是一种什么关系？这是共产主义的关系。但是，就是在这块共产主义的工地上，人民内部也还存在着矛盾，有时表现为先进和落后的矛盾，有时在这种矛盾上却也盖着阶级的烙印。他以工程中一再突破定额的许多故事为例，指出定额保守的往往是内行人，突破定额的往往是外行人，内行人是有贡献的，问题是在于要政治挂帅；要领导人民突破陈规，不断革命。
    中共北京市委宣传部部长杨述说：毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论是来自实际又指导实际。它贯串了不断革命的思想，贯串了充分发动群众进行社会主义建设的思想。只有正确解决人民内部矛盾，才能充分发动群众。处理人民内部矛盾的方法，经过一年的实践，有了新的发展，这就是用“大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报”这种群众路线的方法来正确处理人民内部的矛盾。实践证明，采用这种方法的结果，在人民内部已经出现了一个生动活泼的政治局面。杨述还就敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾这两种矛盾的性质和处理方法作了阐述。他并且提出要打破哲学神秘化的观念，大家都来学哲学、用哲学，学习毛泽东同志的著作，把辩证唯物论用到实际工作中去。
    在座谈会上发言的，还有中国人民大学副校长聂真、中共宣武区委员会书记张旭、中共北京工业学院党委第二书记刘雪初、中共石油学院委员会副书记贾?、中共清华大学委员会副书记艾知生等。他们都结合本单位处理人民内部矛盾的事例，谈述了自己对毛主席这篇论著的体会。
