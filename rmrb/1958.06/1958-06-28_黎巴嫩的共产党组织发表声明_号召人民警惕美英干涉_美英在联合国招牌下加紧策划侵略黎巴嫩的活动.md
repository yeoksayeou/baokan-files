Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 26th: “Al-Nour” newspaper published on the 26th a recent statement issued by the communist organizations in Lebanon. The statement called on the people to unite and continue the struggle to overthrow Chamoun's rule and guard against any interference by imperialism in Lebanese affairs.

The statement said that at this critical moment, it is necessary to be vigilant against the conspiracies of the U.S. and Britain to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs.

The statement condemned the U.S. and Britain for interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs by providing weapons to the Lebanese ruling clique and inciting the Baghdad Pact countries.

The statement said that the purpose of the people's uprising is to overthrow Chamoun, establish a national democratic government, free Lebanon from the Eisenhower Doctrine, implement a free national policy, and establish friendly relations with the United Arab Republic.

The statement warned: "Let there be no rifts among us, lest we be exploited by imperialists and their agents."

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: New York dispatch: Despite the serious warnings from the uprising people of Lebanon, the U.S. and Britain are intensifying their conspiracies to intervene militarily in Lebanon in various ways. Of particular note are the various activities being carried out under the guise of the United Nations.

After talks with the Lebanese government, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld returned to New York from Beirut on the 26th. At the airport, he emphasized that he hoped the United Nations "observation committee" would be able to "improve" the situation in Lebanon and prevent further so-called "infiltration and delivery of weapons" into Lebanon.

According to Western news agencies, the first measure being actively planned is to rapidly expand the United Nations "observation committee" in Lebanon so that it "effectively performs the functions of a police force." At the same time, the U.S. and Britain are also brewing a proposal to the United Nations Security Council, requesting the rapid dispatch of a "United Nations police force" to Lebanon, with the U.S. and Britain deploying a large number of land and naval forces to participate. If this proposal is vetoed by the Soviet Union in the Security Council, an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly will be requested.

Another element of the U.S. and British plans is that if United Nations action is inconvenient, the U.S. and Britain will directly send troops to intervene.

Lebanese President Chamoun received reporters from CBS in Beirut on the 26th regarding the Lebanese situation. He said that if the situation in Lebanon "deteriorates rapidly," he would again request the Security Council to take action. If the Security Council cannot take action due to the Soviet veto, he would appeal to the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. Chamoun said that before the Security Council takes action, the Lebanese government will request assistance from "friendly countries," and he believes that the United States is "entitled to intervene in any place where it has significant interests."

Xinhua News Agency, London, June 27th: Nuri al-Said, the Prime Minister of the Iraq-Jordan Federation, who is currently visiting London, openly called on the West to interfere in the internal affairs of his neighbor Lebanon in an interview with the "Daily Mail" today, and expressed his willingness to serve this intervention.

Said said: "I see no objection to the Lebanese government requesting the United States and Britain to establish a line of defense along the border (of Lebanon) bordering Syria." At the same time, he also expressed his support for sending an intervention force to Lebanon in the name of a "United Nations force" consisting of troops from the United States, Britain, Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, and other countries, believing that "there is even less to object to." He also stated that Iraq "will do our best to provide assistance."

    黎巴嫩的共产党组织发表声明
    号召人民警惕美英干涉
    美英在联合国招牌下加紧策划侵略黎巴嫩的活动
    据新华社大马士革电　“光明报”26日刊载了在黎巴嫩的共产党组织最近发表的声明。声明号召人民团结一致，继续斗争，推翻夏蒙的统治和提防帝国主义对黎巴嫩事务的任何干涉行为。
    声明说，在这个危急的时刻必须警惕美英干涉黎巴嫩内政的阴谋。
    声明谴责美英通过向黎巴嫩统治集团提供武器和煽动巴格达条约国家等办法来干涉黎巴嫩的内政。
    声明说，人民起义的目的是为了推翻夏蒙，建立全国的民主政府，使黎巴嫩摆脱艾森豪威尔主义，执行自由的国家政策和同阿拉伯联合共和国建立友好关系。
    声明警告说：“我们之间不要有任何裂痕，以免被帝国主义者和他们的代理人利用”。
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：尽管黎巴嫩起义人民提出严重警告，美英两国以各种方式武装干涉黎巴嫩的阴谋仍在加紧进行，而特别引人注目的是在联合国招牌下展开的种种活动。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在黎巴嫩政府会谈以后已经在26日从贝鲁特回到纽约。他在机场上强调，他希望联合国的“观察委员会”将能够“改善”黎巴嫩局势，并且能够使所谓对黎巴嫩的进一步“渗入和运送武器”得以“避免”。
    据西方通讯社透露，正在积极策划中的第一个办法是迅速扩大在黎巴嫩的联合国“观察委员会”，使它“实际上履行一支警察部队的职能”。同时，美英两国也在酝酿向联合国安全理事会提出提案，要求迅速派遣“联合国警察部队”到黎巴嫩，美英两国将调派大批陆海军参加。如果这一提案在安全理事会中遭到苏联否决，就将要求召开联合国大会紧急会议。
    美英两国的策划中的另一个内容是如果联合国行动不便，美英将直接出动部队进行干涉。
    黎巴嫩总统夏蒙26日在贝鲁特就黎巴嫩局势接见了美国哥伦比亚广播公司的记者。他说，如果黎巴嫩局势“迅速恶化”，他将再次要求安全理事会采取行动，如果安全理事会因为苏联的否决而不能采取行动，他将求助于联合国大会全体会议。夏蒙说，在安全理事会采取行动以前，黎巴嫩政府将向“友好国家”请求援助，而他认为，美国是“有权在它具有重大利益的任何地方进行干涉的”。
    据新华社伦敦27日电　目前正在伦敦进行访问的伊拉克—约旦联邦首相努里·赛义德，今天在对“每日邮报”记者发表谈话时，公开地要求西方干涉他的邻国黎巴嫩的内政，并且表示愿意为这种干涉效劳。
    赛义德说：“如果黎巴嫩政府请求美国和英国沿着（黎巴嫩）同叙利亚接壤的边境设立一道防线，我看不出有什么可反对的”。同时，他也表示赞成用“联合国部队”的名义派遣一支包括美、英、伊拉克、约旦、土耳其以及其他国家的军队的干涉军去黎巴嫩，认为这“更没有什么可反对的”。他还表示，伊拉克“将尽我们最大的力量来提供帮助”。
