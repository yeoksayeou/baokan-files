Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 17th: Cai Zuquan, a young technician from a worker background, has become an expert in the manufacturing of high-vacuum precision instruments through diligent study and bold innovation. The Physics Department of Fudan University has hired him to teach and conduct research in high-vacuum technology. Young teachers recognize him as a red banner in the school.

Cai Zuquan is the director of the glass workshop at the affiliated instrument manufacturing factory of Fudan University. Since 1954, he has successfully manufactured eighteen types of high-vacuum precision instruments that previously relied on imports; he has also installed more than twenty sets of high-vacuum systems for both on and off campus use. All these instruments have reached the advanced level of similar high-end products internationally, while the cost is generally only about one-tenth of that of imported goods. Currently, the majority of these eighteen products are being mass-produced at the state-owned Shanghai Glass Factory. In recent years, Cai Zuquan has also trained a group of technicians in blowing high-vacuum instruments for more than twenty universities, scientific research institutions, and production units in Shanghai and other places; he has opened a glass instrument blowing technology training class at Fudan University, compiled a set of lectures, and taught assistant teachers, graduate students, and teaching assistants from the Physics and Chemistry departments.

This highly respected and welcomed expert in high-vacuum precision instruments comes from a poor urban family, has only three years of primary school education, and started working as an apprentice blowing small glass ampoules in the injection department of a pharmaceutical factory at the age of fourteen. During the days of suffering exploitation and oppression by capitalists, he participated in the underground struggle led by the Party, and then joined the Party. After liberation, he was successively transferred to the laboratories of Jiaotong University and Fudan University to do some technical work, and also served as a member of the school Party committee and secretary of a Party branch. Although his professional work and social work were very busy, he always tried to make use of his spare time to study cultural and scientific knowledge for two or three hours every day. Over the years, he has completed the courses of mathematics, physics, and chemistry in junior and senior high schools, and has repeatedly studied in detail scientific and technical books in Chinese and foreign languages ​​such as "High-Vacuum Technology," "Manufacturing and Utilization of Glass Instruments," and "Welding of Metals and Glass." He is not satisfied with knowing and memorizing formulas, and he will not stop until he understands how each formula is derived. If he doesn't understand something, he humbly learns from others. If he encounters metalworking problems at work, he asks metalworkers; if he encounters electrical problems, he asks electricians; if he doesn't understand the principles, he asks teachers.

After the Physics Department of Fudan University successfully trial-produced X-ray tubes, it wanted to expand production, but the production department did not have equipment such as diffusion pumps for extracting vacuum, and the entire set of equipment for trial-producing X-ray tubes in the school was imported. At this time, professors and lecturers advocated ordering from abroad, but Cai Zuquan suggested that the school try to produce it itself. The teachers thought it was impossible, so he imitated the imported goods and started working on it himself. The precision of drilling holes in the nozzle of the diffusion pump was relatively high. He used a drill bit to drill holes, and the glass broke immediately. After painstaking thinking and exploration, he found a method of drilling holes with a tungsten rod. When welding the nozzle into the glass tube, he ruined five or six in a row, but he was not discouraged and intensified his glass welding skills. After working hard for five days, he finally successfully trial-produced the first mercury diffusion pump. After verification, the degree of vacuum extracted was exactly the same as that of the imported mercury diffusion pump at the time. The imported product cost 300 yuan per unit, while Cai Zuquan only spent more than ten yuan in material costs. In the series of more complex instruments he later successfully trial-produced, some were improved based on foreign styles, and some were boldly designed and manufactured by himself based on the product names and performance descriptions in foreign merchandise catalogs in the absence of any samples or data. Cai Zuquan is very disgusted with all reliance on foreign countries. He firmly believes that what foreigners can do, we can certainly do. He often encourages the workers in the glass workshop to dare to think and dare to do.

In Cai Zuquan's workshop and office, there are often people looking for him to discuss issues, and he often receives banners and thank-you letters from production departments. He often takes advantage of gaps in time to visit factories, learning and understanding production conditions and needs. He always encourages everyone to go all out for the requirements put forward by the production department. Now he is cooperating with the Shanghai Glass Factory to organize the trial production of various types of large-rate new diffusion pumps and other high-vacuum instruments, a total of seven or eight types. In April of this year, the Central Laboratory of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, in coordination with the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry, wanted to carry out alloy steel analysis work and needed a thermal extraction hydrogen analyzer. If it were ordered from abroad, it would not only cost several thousand yuan, but it would also take a year to arrive. They found Cai Zuquan, and this enthusiastic man delivered the goods in just over two months and personally rushed to the unit to install the instrument. After making great achievements in his work, Cai Zuquan still maintains a humble, studious, and hardworking spirit, and he always teaches his technology to others without reservation.

    思想红　胆子大　钻劲足
    普通工人蔡祖泉成了专家
    据新华社上海17日电　工人出身的青年技术员蔡祖泉，刻苦钻研，大胆创造，成为高真空精密仪器制造专家。复旦大学物理系已聘请他担任高真空技术方面的教学和研究工作。青年教师公认他是学校里的一面红旗。
    蔡祖泉是复旦大学附设仪器制造厂玻璃车间主任。1954年以来，他先后制造成功十八种过去一直依靠国外进口的高真空精密仪器；还为校内外装制了二十多套高真空系统。所有这些仪器，都达到了国际上同种高级产品的先进水平，而成本一般却只有进口货的十分之一左右。现在这十八种产品中绝大部分已在国营上海玻璃厂大量生产。几年来，蔡祖泉还为上海及各地的二十多个高等学校、科学研究机构和生产单位培养了一批吹制高真空仪器的技术人员；在复旦大学开办了一个玻璃仪器吹制技术训练班，自己编了一套讲义，给物理、化学两系的助教、研究生和教学辅助人员上课。
    这位深受尊敬和欢迎的高真空精密仪器专家出身城市贫民的家庭，只读过三年小学，十四岁起就在一个制药厂的针药部当一名吹制针药小玻璃瓶的徒工，在受尽资本家的剥削压迫的日子里，他参加了党所领导的地下斗争，接着又参加了党。解放后，他先后被调到交通大学、复旦大学的实验室里做一些技术工作，还担任了学校党委委员，和一个党支部的书记。虽然业务工作和社会工作都很繁忙，他还总是尽量坚持每天利用业余时间自学文化和科学知识两三小时。几年来他学完了初中和高中的数、理、化课程，还反复地精读了“高真空技术”、“玻璃仪器的制造和利用”、“金属与玻璃焊接”等中文和外文的科学技术书籍。他不满足于知道和记住公式，对每个公式是怎样推论出来的，不钻个清楚是不罢休的。自己不懂就虚心向别人学习，工作中遇到金工问题就请教金工，遇到电工问题就请教电工，原理不懂就问教师。
    复旦大学物理系试制成功X光管以后，要扩大生产，但是生产部门没有抽真空的扩散泵等设备，学校试制X光管的一套设备都是进口的。这时教授和讲师们主张到外国订购，蔡祖泉建议学校自己试制。教师们认为不行，他就自己仿造进口货干起来了。在扩散泵喷口上打孔的精密度要求比较高，他用钻头打孔，一下就把玻璃打坏。经过苦苦思索和摸索，他找到了用钨棒打孔的办法。在把喷口焊接到玻璃管里的时候，一连做坏了五、六个，他还是不灰心，加紧锻炼玻璃焊接技术。这样苦干了五天，终于试制成功第一个水银扩散泵。经过校验，所抽真空的高度与当时进口的水银扩散泵完全相同。进口货要三百元一只，而蔡祖泉只花了十多元材料费。在他以后试制成功的一系列的更为复杂的仪器中，有些是根据外国式样加以改进的，有些是他在没有任何样品或资料的情况下，根据外国商品目录上的产品名称和性能介绍，自己大胆设计和制造的。蔡祖泉对一切依赖外国非常反感，他深信外国人能办的，我们一定也能办。他经常鼓励玻璃车间里的职工们要敢想敢做。
    在蔡祖泉的车间和办公室里经常有找他商量问题的人，也常收到生产部门送来的锦旗和感谢信。他常常利用空隙时间到工厂参观访问，一面学习，一面了解生产情况和需要。对于生产部门提出的要求，他总是鼓动大家全力以赴。现在他正在和上海玻璃厂合作，组织试制各种类型的大速率的新型扩散泵及其他高真空仪器，共七、八种。今年4月，上海钢铁公司中心试验室配合钢铁工业的大跃进，要开展合金钢分析工作，需要一种热出法定氢仪，如果到国外订制，不仅售价几千元，而且等一年也不能到手。他们找到了蔡祖泉，这位热心人在两个多月后就交了货，还亲自赶到这个单位把仪器安装好。在工作上作出了很大成绩以后，蔡祖泉仍然保持着谦逊、好学和苦干精神，他的技术也总是毫无保留地教给别人。
