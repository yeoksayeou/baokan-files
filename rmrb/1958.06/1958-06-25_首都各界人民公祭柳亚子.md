Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: People from all walks of life in the capital Beijing publicly mourned Liu Yazi, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, this morning.

    The public memorial service was held at the Sun Yat-sen Hall in Zhongshan Park. The atmosphere inside the hall was solemn. The coffin of Comrade Liu Yazi was placed amidst flowers. A black纱 was draped over the portrait of Comrade Liu Yazi in front of the coffin. The hall was filled with wreaths sent by national leaders, democratic parties, and various organizations. Wreaths from Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai were placed on both sides of Comrade Liu Yazi's coffin. There were also some elegiac couplets on the walls of the hall. After Comrade Liu Yazi's death, his family also received condolences from Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Director He Xiangning, and some of his friends.

    The public memorial service was presided over by Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Chen Yi, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Wu Yuzhang, and Chen Shutong.

    Those attending the public memorial service included members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, heads of various departments of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, as well as relatives and friends of Comrade Liu Yazi.

    More than 600 people attended the public memorial service.

    As the public memorial service began, the band played funeral music. Presiding celebrant Chairman Liu Shaoqi presented a wreath to the coffin of Comrade Liu Yazi.

    Next, Wu Yuzhang, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, delivered a eulogy. He said that as a patriotic poet and staunch democratic revolutionary, Mr. Yazi dared to uphold the truth and had clear likes and dislikes. After the Zhongshan Warship Incident in 1926, Chiang Kai-shek organized the so-called "Central Special Committee," exposing his conspiracy to betray the revolution. Mr. Yazi, along with Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, Peng Zemin, and others, adhered to the "Three Great Policies" and resolutely opposed him. In 1937, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, launched a full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan, which Mr. Yazi actively supported. In 1945, Mr. Yazi arrived in Chongqing and witnessed Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of creating division and attempting to surrender, which increasingly strengthened his belief that only the Communist Party could save China and his yearning for the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. At the anniversary celebration of the founding of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, he publicly declared: "The light of the world is in Moscow, and the light of China is in Yan'an," and recited the poem "Two lighthouses shine brightly in the world, Yan'an remotely connects to Moscow," which he sent to Chairman Mao.

    Wu Yuzhang also said that after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries intensified their traitorous and dictatorial crimes, and openly launched an anti-people and counter-revolutionary civil war with the support of American imperialism. Mr. Yazi first initiated the "Sanminzhuyi Comrades Association" in Chongqing with patriotic and democratic elements within the Kuomintang. Later, he participated in the initiation of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Hong Kong and served as its Secretary-General, actively responding to the call of the Communist Party of China on May 1, 1948, to convene a new political consultative conference. In 1949, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, achieved a great victory in the people's revolution. Mr. Yazi participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and was elected as a member of the Central People's Government. In 1954, he was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress and a member of the Standing Committee. During the first National Day, he composed a poem on Tiananmen Square: "The alliance leads workers and peasants, a hundred battles complete the liberation feat. This is the new National Day of the people, ten thousand flags red in the Yangko song." This poem expressed the patriotic poet's joy and enthusiastic praise for the victory of the people's revolution.

    Wu Yuzhang concluded by saying that in recent years, although Mr. Yazi's health limited his political activities and poetry creation, he still strived to participate in important meetings and unreservedly supported the Communist Party's policies, until his last breath.

    At 10:30 a.m., the removal of the coffin began, with Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other participants in the public memorial service acting as pallbearers.

    At 11:30 a.m., the remains of Comrade Liu Yazi were buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

    首都各界人民公祭柳亚子
    新华社24日讯　首都各界人民今天上午公祭全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员柳亚子。
    公祭大会在中山公园中山堂举行。中山堂内一片肃穆气氛。柳亚子委员的灵柩停放在鲜花之中。灵柩前面柳亚子委员的遗像上披了黑纱。堂内四周摆满了国家领导人员和各民主党派、各机关团体送的花圈。在柳亚子委员灵柩两旁，摆着毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理送的花圈。中山堂内墙壁上还有一些挽联。在柳亚子委员逝世以后，他的家属还收到了宋庆龄副委员长、何香凝主任以及他的一些生前好友的唁电。
    公祭大会由刘少奇、周恩来、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈毅、黄炎培、李维汉、吴玉章、陈叔通主祭。
    参加公祭大会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、国务院各部门、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的负责人，北京市副市长以及柳亚子委员的亲戚和生前好友等。
    参加公祭大会的共有六百多人。
    公祭大会开始时，乐队奏哀乐。主祭人刘少奇委员长向柳亚子委员灵柩献花圈。
    接着，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员吴玉章致悼词。他说，亚子先生作为一个爱国诗人和坚定的民主主义革命者，是敢于坚持真理、爱憎分明的。1926年中山舰事件发生后，蒋介石组织所谓“中央特别委员会”暴露了他背叛革命的阴谋，亚子先生同宋庆龄、何香凝、彭泽民等坚持“三大政策”，坚决加以反对。1937年，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，发动了全面的抗日战争，亚子先生积极拥护。1945年，先生到了重庆，目睹蒋介石制造分裂，企图投降的罪行日益显露，更加强了先生的只有共产党才能救中国的信念和对革命圣地延安的向往。在重庆新华日报创刊的纪念会上，他公开宣称：“世界的光明在莫斯科，中国的光明在延安”，并且吟出了“世界光明两灯塔，延安遥接莫斯科”的诗，寄给毛主席。
    吴玉章还说，抗日战争胜利以后，蒋介石国民党反动派变本加厉地进行卖国独裁的罪恶勾当，在美帝国主义的支持下，公开发动反人民反革命的内战。先生先在重庆同国民党内部的爱国民主分子发起了“三民主义同志联合会”，后来，又在香港参加了中国国民党革命委员会的发起工作，并担任秘书长的职务，积极响应了1948年5月1日中国共产党所提出的召开新的政治协商会议的号召。1949年，中国人民在共产党领导下取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。亚子先生参加了中国人民政治协商会议，并且当选为中央人民政府委员，1954年当选为全国人民代表大会代表和常务委员会委员。在第一届国庆节的时候，先生在天安门上曾吟诗一首：联盟领导属工农，百战完成解放功。此是人民新国庆，秧歌声里万旗红。这首诗表达了这位爱国诗人对人民革命胜利所感到的欢欣鼓舞和热情歌颂。
    吴玉章最后说，几年来，亚子先生纵然因健康限制了他的政治活动和诗词创作，然而他仍然奋力参加重要的会议，无保留地拥护共产党的方针政策，一直到他最后一息。
    十时半开始起灵，执绋的有刘少奇委员长，周恩来总理和其他参加公祭的人员。
    十一时半，柳亚子委员的遗体在八宝山革命公墓安葬。
