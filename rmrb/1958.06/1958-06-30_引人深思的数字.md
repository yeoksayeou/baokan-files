    Thought-Provoking Numbers
    Jian Yan
    On May 31st, the Hubei Daily published the following statistics regarding 124 individuals who had made inventions and creations:
    Education Level: Primary School: 80 people; Illiterate: 24 people; Secondary School: 20 people.
    Background: Workers: 80 people; Farmers: 29 people; Students: 14 people; Small Business Owners: 1 person.
    Age: Under 25 years old: 25 people; 25 to 40 years old: 96 people; Over 40 years old: 3 people.
    The numbers show: 84% had primary school education or below; 88% were workers and farmers; 97% were young and middle-aged. As for high-level intellectuals with university degrees or above, there were none.
    Why is this? Is it that in scientific and technological inventions and creations, those with higher education are in a worse position than those with lower education, and experienced "experts" are not as good as "outsiders"? I don't think so. Education and experience are always advantageous conditions for invention and creation. I think the fundamental reason is probably ideological constraints.
    Many experts and scholars have knowledge and learning, but they are very superstitious. They are superstitious about foreigners, do not believe in themselves, and dare not do things that foreigners have not succeeded in. They are also superstitious about themselves, do not believe in the masses, do not learn from the masses, do not rely on the masses, and always fight alone, resulting in a waste of lifelong energy and nothing accomplished.
    They have experience, but they are very conservative. They neither believe in the masses nor in new things. The "special theory of science," "specification theory," and "condition theory" that have long existed in their minds are always unwilling to be broken. I heard that some fish experts, when studying whether frogs swallow fish fry, always follow the old "scientific" rules, carefully dissecting the frog's abdomen with a scalpel, slowly observing, which takes a long time and leads to slow conclusions. Some farmers, although without experience, directly tear open the frog's legs by hand, turn over the frog's belly, and see the answer immediately. It seems that the "local methods" considered by scientists are more effective.
    They have "prestige" and "reputation," but they are very proud. Not only do they completely despise those "unknown figures" and the workers and peasants, but they are also unwilling to absorb the experience of famous people. Many problems in real life that urgently need to be solved are considered "small things" and are not worth doing. They want to specialize in "profound theories," but they are ambitious but incompetent and accomplish nothing.
    On the other hand, those who are considered "ordinary people," "roughnecks," and "youngsters" rarely have these ideological shackles. They are brave, straightforward, and bold. Once they break the superstition of "experts" and "scholars" and cut off their sense of inferiority, they can create amazing miracles.

    引人深思的数字
    简言
    5月31日，湖北日报上，刊载了这样一个统计数字，在一百二十四名有发明创造的人中：
    文化程度：小学　八十人；文盲　二十四人；中学　二十人。
    出身：工人　八十人；农民二十九人；学生　十四人；小业主一人。
    年龄：二十五岁以下二十五人；二十五到四十岁　九十六人；四十岁以上三人。
    数字表明：小学程度以下的占84％；工人和农民占88％；青壮年占97％。至于大学以上的高级知识分子，则一个没有。
    这是为什么呢？是不是在科学技术的发明创造上，文化程度高的反不如文化低的条件好，有经验的“专家”，反不如“外行”呢？我想，不是这样。文化、经验，任何时候都是发明创造上的有利条件。我想，根本原因，恐怕还是思想上的束缚。
    很多专家学者，有知识，有学问，但很迷信。他们迷信外国人，不相信自己，外国未做成功的事，他们不敢做。他们也迷信自己，不相信群众，不向群众学习，不依靠群众，总是单枪匹马，孤军作战，结果毕生精力白白浪费，一事无成。
    他们有阅历有经验，但很保守。既不相信群众，也不相信新事物。脑子里长期存在的“科学特殊论”、“规格论”、“条件论”，总是不肯打破。听说有的鱼类专家，在研究青蛙是否吞食鱼苗的时候，总是按着“科学”老规矩，用解剖刀“四平八稳”地剖开蛙腹，慢慢观察，费时很长，结论很慢。有的农民，虽无经验，但他用手直接将蛙腿扯开，翻开蛙肚一看，便立见分晓。看来被科学家认为的“土方法”反而更见效。
    他们有“声望”，有“名誉”，但很骄傲。不但根本瞧不起那些“无名人物”和工农群众，就是名人的经验，也不愿吸收。现实生活中的许多亟待解决的问题，他们认为是“小事”、不屑一做，想专门研究“高深理论”，但又眼高手低，无所成就。
    而那些被认为是“普通人”“大老粗”和“青年小伙子”的人却很少有这些思想镣铐。他们勇敢直爽、大胆敢为，他们一旦打破对“专家”“学者”的迷信，砍掉自卑感，就能够创造出惊人的奇迹。
