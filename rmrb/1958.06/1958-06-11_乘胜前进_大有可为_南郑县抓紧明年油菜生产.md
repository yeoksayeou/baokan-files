Advance Victoriously, Great Potential
Nanzheng County Seizes Next Year's Rapeseed Production

(Our dispatch) Nanzheng County, Shaanxi, has achieved a widespread bumper harvest of rapeseed on more than 46,000 mu. Currently, the entire county's rapeseed harvest is complete. According to actual measurements, the yield per mu of rapeseed in the county has reached 180 jin, an increase of 63.34% compared to last year. At the same time, many high-yield areas have emerged. The Nanzheng County Farm's 35 mu of "Victory" rapeseed averaged 350 jin per mu this year, including more than two mu of high-yield experimental fields, averaging over 400 jin per mu. The highest, the Zhulin Agricultural Cooperative, had one and one-third mu of high-yield experimental field, averaging 600 jin per mu.

The most important reason for Nanzheng County's rapeseed harvest this year is the emphasis placed on it by the leadership, with the Party and government working together. When Nanzheng County began mobilizing the masses to expand the area sown with rapeseed, there was significant ideological resistance among many. Many cadres and masses believed that planting rapeseed did not yield as much as other grain crops, and that rapeseed was a low-yield crop. In response, the Party and government leadership of Nanzheng County launched mass discussions to eliminate the masses' concerns about the economic viability of planting rapeseed. During these discussions, in addition to publicizing the importance of oil production to the masses, various localities widely cited numerous examples of high-yield rapeseed harvests in the area, demonstrating that rapeseed was not a low-yield crop, but rather that low yields were due to poor cultivation.

During the sowing and growth period of rapeseed, field management was strengthened, with particular attention paid to improving rapeseed cultivation techniques and management methods. Timely sowing was carried out, and improved varieties were widely promoted. More than 7,500 mu of "Victory" rapeseed have been sown in the county. Close planting has been implemented, reducing the row spacing of rapeseed from two chi in the past to one chi five cun, and the plant spacing from six to seven cun to four to five cun. The number of plants sown per mu has generally increased from the original 8,000 to the current 12,000 to 15,000. Strengthening field management mainly focused on early thinning and early seedling establishment. Generally, fertilizer was applied four to five times, with the most reaching six times. The amount of fertilizer applied also reached over 10,000 jin, an increase of nearly half compared to the past. In the past, local farmers had no habit of watering rapeseed. During the Great Leap Forward this year, 50% of the rapeseed fields were winter irrigated, and more than 60% of the rapeseed fields were spring irrigated, thus leading to a widespread bumper harvest of rapeseed this year.

In order to strive for further increases in oil production, Nanzheng County proposed to further uphold the slogan of "grain, cotton, and oil" and "vegetable oil and woody oil crops" simultaneously. The county plans to expand the area sown with rapeseed to 50,000 mu next year, with an average yield per mu of 300 jin. Two hundred mu of land are to average 700 jin per mu, and 10,000 mu of land are to average 500 jin per mu. Their measures are: to promote "Victory" rapeseed, eliminate short rapeseed and tall rapeseed, and promote seedling cultivation and transplantation. Implement "three grasps and six transformations." The "three grasps" are to grasp the season, grasp the time, and grasp fertilizer. The "six transformations" are to change direct sowing to seedling cultivation, change average fertilization to applying sufficient base fertilizer, emphasizing topdressing fertilizer, and applying timely and appropriate topdressing fertilizer, change no irrigation to winter and spring irrigation; change disease and pest control to complete elimination; change two plows and two harrows to three plows and four harrows; and change sparse planting to dense planting.

    乘胜前进　大有可为
    南郑县抓紧明年油菜生产
    本报讯　陕西南郑县四万六千多亩油菜普遍丰收。现在，全县的油菜已经收打完毕，根据实打的结果，全县油菜的单位面积产量已经达到一百八十斤，比去年提高63.34％。同时，还涌现出许多高额丰产地，南郑县农场今年播种的三十五亩胜利油菜，平均每亩达到三百五十斤，其中并有二亩多高额丰产试验田，平均每亩达到四百斤以上。最高的竹林农业社有一亩三分高额丰产试验田，平均每亩达到六百斤。
    南郑县今年油菜丰收的最重要的原因是领导上重视，党、政一齐抓，南郑县开始发动群众扩大油菜播种面积时，有许多群众的思想阻力很大。不少干部和群众认为，种油菜不如种其他粮食作物产量高，油菜是低产作物。南郑县的党、政领导部门，针对这种情况，发动群众鸣放辩论，消除了群众嫌种油菜划不过账的顾虑。在鸣放中，除向群众宣传了油料生产的重要意义外，各地普遍列举了当地油菜获得高额丰产的大量事例，说明油菜并不是低产作物，而是作务不好才产量低。
    在油菜播种和生长期间，加强了田间管理，并特别注意了改进油菜的栽培技术和管理方法。进行适时播种。普遍推广良种。全县播种的胜利油菜已经有七千五百多亩。推行了密植，将油菜的行距由过去的二尺缩短到一尺五寸，窝距由六寸到七寸缩短到四至五寸，每亩播种的株数普遍由原来的八千株，增加到现在的一万二千到一万五千株。加强田间管理，主要抓住了早间苗和提早定苗。一般都施了四次至五次肥料，最多的已经施到了六次。施肥量也达到了一万斤以上，比过去增加将近一半。过去当地农民都没有给油菜浇水的习惯，今年在大跃进中，50％的油菜地进行了冬灌，60％以上的油菜地进行春浇，因此，使今年的油菜普遍丰收。
    为了争取油料进一步增产，南郑县提出要进一步使“粮、棉和油”并举、“植物油和木本油料作物”并重的口号。全县计划在明年将油菜播种面积扩大到五万亩，平均每亩单位面积产量要达到三百斤。有二百亩地平均每亩达到七百斤，一万亩地平均每亩达到五百斤。他们的措施是：推广胜利油菜，消灭矮油菜和高杆油菜，推广育苗移栽。实行三抓、六改，三抓是抓季节、抓时间、抓肥料。六改是改直播为育苗，改平均施肥，为饱施底肥，重视台肥，适时适量追肥，改不灌为冬春灌；改病虫防治为彻底消灭；改二犁二耙为三犁四耙；改稀植为密植。
