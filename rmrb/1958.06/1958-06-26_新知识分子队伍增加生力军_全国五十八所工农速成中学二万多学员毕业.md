Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch: A fresh force has been added to the ranks of the working class intellectuals. Recently, over 22,200 students graduated from 58 workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools across the country.

These 58 workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools are distributed in 24 provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, and Jiangsu, totaling 528 classes. The students graduating this term enrolled in 1954 and include workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers, and cadres. Among the more than 10,100 students from worker backgrounds, 531 are national and local labor models. In the old society, these students lost the opportunity to study due to the hardships of life. Before entering the workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools, some had only attended elementary school for a few years, and after liberation, they reached the level of upper elementary school graduates through spare-time study. In the workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools, they received great care and support from the Party and the government. Each school was equipped with more than 1,460 excellent teachers who patiently guided them in their studies in all aspects. After four years of hard work, they completed the basic courses of ordinary middle schools with generally excellent results.

These workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools implement three types of teaching plans: liberal arts, science and engineering, and agricultural medicine. The number of science and engineering classes and students accounts for more than half. After graduation, most of the students will enter universities and continue to attack the fortress of culture and science; some will take up positions in industry, agriculture, culture, and education.

    新知识分子队伍增加生力军
    全国五十八所工农速成中学二万多学员毕业
    新华社25日讯　工人阶级知识分子队伍中增加一支生力军，全国五十八所工农速成中学，最近有二万二千二百多人毕业。
    这五十八所工农速成中学分布在北京、上海、河北、江苏等二十四个省、市，共计五百二十八个班。这一期毕业的学生，是1954年入学的，其中包括工人、农民、革命军人、机关干部等。一万零一百多个工人出身的学员中，有全国和各地劳动模范五百三十一人。这些学员过去在旧社会为生活所迫，失去了学习的机会，进入工农速成中学前，有的只上过几年小学，解放后经业余学习才达到高小毕业程度。在工农速成中学，他们受到党和政府极大的关怀和支持；各校配备优秀的教师一千四百六十多人，从各方面耐心地辅导他们学习。他们经过四年的艰苦努力，学完了普通中学的基本课程，一般成绩优良。
    这些工农速成中学实行文史、理工、农医三类教学计划，其中理工科班数和人数占半数以上。学员毕业后，大部分人将升入高等学校，继续向文化科学堡垒进攻；一部分人将走上工农业和文化教育事业岗位。
