    Thoughts Inspired by Workers Learning Philosophy
    Yu Shangsi
    The People's Daily published a piece of news on the front page on June 5th: Shanghai workers are studying and applying philosophy. After reading it, one feels so happy and pleased; one wants to read it again and again.
    Many people, when learning philosophy, always encounter a stumbling block at the beginning: "Philosophy is too mysterious." Some people say that the palace of philosophy is the residence of experts, and we ordinary people cannot enter it. Now, this veil of philosophical mystery has been lifted by the learning practice of Shanghai workers.
    Generally, people feel that philosophy is mysterious probably for two reasons. First, there is a philosophy called idealism, which is indeed mysterious. Rightist element Zhang Naiqi once said: fixed interest is not exploitation, but simply unearned income; and that capitalists are even more progressive than workers and do not need ideological remolding. He, "doing whatever he wants," called white black, and wolves sheep, confused right and wrong, and reversed right and wrong, completely disregarding the actual situation, with the aim of serving the exploiting classes. The philosophy he believed in was idealism. To us ordinary people, this is, of course, very mysterious and incomprehensible. Second, some dogmatists, when teaching philosophy, divorce theory from practice, stick to nouns, split hairs, and don't know how to apply it at all. They talk about Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" but don't relate it to current work, nor do they analyze the students' thoughts. But they gesticulate, shake their heads, and wag their tails, as if every "article" is the "way." Those who listen, of course, feel it is unfathomable, mysterious, and extremely mysterious.
    Shanghai workers are completely different from those idealists and dogmatists. They have not been influenced by idealism and dogmatism. From the very beginning of learning philosophy, they started with Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," and then went on to read Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks," "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," and Engels' "Anti-Dühring," and "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy". This is an excellent experience: to learn philosophy, start with the classic works of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, instead of learning through "second-hand" works. Engels revealed this news to us long ago.
    The purpose of learning philosophy is not for "gilding" or for show, but for application, to solve problems in life, thought, and work. Chairman Mao told us: "As for the theory of Marxism, it is necessary to be proficient in it and apply it. The purpose of proficiency lies entirely in application." Shanghai workers have set a very good example for us in this regard. For example, a production team was not united and had no energy to work, so production had not been able to complete the task. However, by February of this year, the production task was overfulfilled by more than double. What is the reason for this? Everyone analyzed from the principle of philosophy that internal causes play a decisive role. It turned out that the main reason was that after the education of the Great Leap Forward situation, people's thinking had changed, the team members cooperated with each other in unity, and their labor enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. What a vivid example.
    The specific examples of Shanghai workers learning and applying philosophy tell us that philosophy is something everyone can learn, as long as they are serious. Moreover, it is not difficult to become a philosopher. The German leather worker Dietzgen used his spare time to study philosophy, independently studied many philosophical issues, and came to conclusions that were very close to Marx and Engels' dialectical materialism. Our current workers and cadres have much better conditions than Dietzgen. What Dietzgen can do, we can certainly do.
    Philosophy is not mysterious, and if you don't learn philosophy, your mind cannot be thoroughly liberated.

    从工人学哲学想起的
    于尚思
    人民日报6月5日在头版发表了一条消息：上海工人学哲学用哲学。读了以后，真叫人痛快、高兴；看了一遍还想再看一遍。
    许多人在学哲学的时候，开头总要遇到一个拦路虎：“哲学太神秘了”。有些人说，哲学的殿堂是专家的住宅，我们普通人是不得其门而入的。现在，这个哲学神秘的幕，被上海工人的学习实践揭开了。
    一般人感到哲学神秘，大概有两个原因。第一，有一种哲学叫做唯心论，那确实是神秘的。右派分子章乃器曾说：定息不是剥削，只是不劳而获；又说：资本家比工人还进步，用不着思想改造了。他“随心所欲”地，把白的说成黑的，把狼说成是羊，混淆黑白，颠倒是非，全然不顾实际的情况，目的是要给剥削阶级服务，他所信奉的哲学，就是唯心论。这在我们一般人看来，当然就很神秘，不可理解了。第二，有些教条主义者，在教人哲学的时候，理论脱离实际，死扣名词，钻牛角尖，一点不会运用；讲毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”，却不联系当前的工作，也不分析学生的思想，可是他指手划脚，摇头摆尾，“条条”是“道”，听的人当然就感到莫测高深，玄而又玄，神秘之极了。
    上海工人跟那些唯心主义者、教条主义者完全不同。他们没有受过唯心主义和教条主义的影响，一开始学习哲学就从毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”入手，然后进而阅读列宁的“哲学笔记”、“唯物论与经验批判论”，恩格斯的“反杜林论”、“费尔巴哈论”。这是一条极好的经验：学哲学要从马列主义哲学经典著作入手，而不必经过“第二手”著作去学。这个消息，恩格斯早就透露给我们了。
    学哲学的目的，不是为了“镀金”、好看，而是为了运用，解决生活、思想、工作中的问题。毛主席告诉我们说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”上海工人在这一点上，给我们做出了很好的榜样。比方，有个生产小组闹不团结，干活没劲，因此生产一直完不成任务，但是，到了今年2月，生产任务却超额完成了一倍多。这是什么原因呢？大家从哲学上的内因起决定作用的道理，分析出来这主要是工人们经过大跃进形势的教育，人的思想起了变化，小组内互相团结合作，劳动热情空前高涨的缘故。这是多么生动的例子啊。
    上海工人学哲学、用哲学的具体事例，告诉了我们：哲学是大家都能学会的，只要认真的话。而且，成为哲学家也不难。德国制革工人狄慈根，利用业余时间学习哲学，独立地研究了哲学上许多问题，得出了和马克思、恩格斯的辩证唯物论极相接近的结论。我们现在的工人、干部，比狄慈根的条件好多了，狄慈根能做到的事，我们当然也能够做到。
    哲学不神秘，而如果不学哲学，思想就不能彻底解放。
