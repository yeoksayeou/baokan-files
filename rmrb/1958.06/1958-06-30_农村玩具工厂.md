Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 29th. Five agricultural cooperatives in Hancun Township, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, have jointly established a children's toy factory and have already produced more than 3,500 various toys.

On the 27th, the factory began its first children's toy exhibition, displaying a total of 136 kinds of children's toys, more than 1,500 pieces. These toys are suitable for the characteristics of rural children, are inexpensive, durable, and have educational significance. The small farm tools - plows, seeders, rakes, and drags - imitated with branches, can provide children with production education through games. The active models made with sandboxes and building blocks can inspire children's ideals, allowing them to engage in activities such as building canals, drilling wells, building factories, and beautifying their hometowns in certain places. Trains and cars made from matchboxes, dolls made from eggshells, and various flower baskets woven from wheat straws are also exquisite and very popular with children.

Since Dali County universally established rural nurseries, a new problem that has emerged in nursery work is that there are many children and few toys, and the nurseries are not very attractive to children. For this reason, the Dali County Women's Federation presided over the trial establishment of this children's toy factory in Hancun Township.

    农村玩具工厂
    据新华社西安29日电　陕西省大荔县汉村乡的五个农业社联合创办了一所儿童玩具工厂，并已制成各种玩具三千五百多件。
    27日，这个工厂开始举行第一次儿童玩具展览会，会上展出的儿童玩具共有一百三十六种一千五百多件。这些玩具适合农村儿童特点，造价低廉，结实耐用，富有教育意义。他们利用树枝仿制的小农具——犁、耧、耙、耱，可以通过游戏，给儿童进行生产教育。用沙盘和积木作的活动模型，可以启发儿童的理想，让儿童作某地修渠、某地打井，以及建筑工厂、美化家乡等活动。利用火柴匣制成火车、汽车，用鸡蛋壳制成的洋娃娃，用麦秸秆编成各种花篮也都是小巧玲珑，很受儿童欢迎。
    大荔县普遍举办农村托儿所以后，托儿工作中出现的新问题是：孩子多，玩具少，托儿所对儿童的吸引力不大，为此，大荔县妇联会主持在汉村乡试办了这个儿童玩具工厂。
