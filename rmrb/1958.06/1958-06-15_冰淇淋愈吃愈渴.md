Why?

    The More Ice Cream You Eat, the Thirstier You Get
    Ice cream tastes sweet, cool and delicious, and feels cool and comfortable when you eat it. But after eating it, you will feel that it is not thirst-quenching. Why is this?
    It turns out that the main ingredients of ice cream are eggs and milk, both of which are rich in protein. The human body needs a lot of water to digest protein. At the same time, when protein enters the body and undergoes metabolism, the useful parts are absorbed by the tissues, and the remaining waste is mainly a substance called urea. Urea must be excreted from the body, but it must be dissolved in water to be excreted in the urine. In this way, the body has to consume a lot of water. Therefore, you will feel even thirstier after eating ice cream. By the same token, you will feel thirsty after eating popsicles. However, because popsicles generally contain less eggs and milk and more water, the thirst is less severe.

### 冰淇淋愈吃愈渴

专栏：为什么？

    冰淇淋愈吃愈渴
    冰淇淋味道香甜、清凉可口，吃的时候感到很凉快舒服。但是吃完了，就会觉得并不解渴，这是为什么呢？
    原来冰淇淋的主要成分是鸡蛋和牛奶，这两样东西都含有丰富的蛋白质。人体消化蛋白质时需要大量的水分，同时，当蛋白质进入体内经过新陈代谢后，有用的部分被组织吸收了，剩下的废物主要是一种叫尿素的东西。尿素必须排出体外，但它要溶在水里才能由尿里排出。这样一来，身体就要消耗很多的水分。所以吃了冰淇淋以后更会感到口渴。同样道理，吃了冰棍以后也会感到口渴。不过因为一般冰棍中含的鸡蛋、牛奶少些，水分多些，所以口渴得轻些。
