    Trying to Cover Up
    After the American pilot Allen Pope, who assisted Indonesian rebels in bombing, was captured by the Indonesian government forces, a representative of the American "Civil Air Transport" came out and stated that Pope was originally an employee of the company, but had applied for "leave" last month and was "approved." Therefore, all of Pope's activities seemed to be "personal activities."
    However, this kind of defense cannot deceive anyone. First, the documents found on Pope proved that he was a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. Second, judging from the revealed facts, the American "Civil Air Transport" (CAT) based in Taipei is not a "civil aviation company" at all, but actually an affiliate of the U.S. Air Force. The American pilots who assisted the rebels in bombing were all supplied by this "civil aviation company," which is an organization that specifically implements the American intervention plan. The "civil aviation company" approved Pope's "leave" precisely to allow him to help the rebels carry out bombings, which precisely further proves the crime of the American authorities in interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.
    Blinded by Greed
    The American "Newsweek" recently published an article by one of its senior editors, Arnaud de Borchgrave, entitled "New Africa," with the subtitle "The situation is favorable to the West…," advocating for intensified economic aggression against Africa.
    The author wrote: "This vast continent can accommodate the entire Soviet Russia and the entire China. It is the largest undeveloped region in the world, yet it is potentially the richest region in the world." After such a vivid introduction, the author argued that Africa's possession of abundant resources while its people are desperately poor is "most favorable to the West." Because, according to the author, targeting this weakness, the United States only needs to "spend money, a lot of money" to swallow this piece of fat.
    This approach has long been a mantra in Washington. What is strange is that this editor, who "just returned from a 15,000-mile trip in fourteen African countries," is turning a blind eye to the boiling African national independence movement. What other explanation can there be besides being "blinded by greed"?

　　札记
    欲盖弥彰
    在协助印度尼西亚叛乱分子进行轰炸的美国飞行员鲍普被印度尼西亚政府军俘获后，美国“民用航空运输公司”的代表出来声明说：鲍普原是该公司的职员，但在上月提出“请假”，并经“准假”，所以鲍普的一切活动似乎只是“个人活动”。
    但是，这种辩解是骗不了什么人的。第一，从鲍普身上搜出的证件证明，他是美国空军中尉。第二，从已经揭发的事实来看，设在台北的美国“民用航空运输公司”即“CAT”，根本不是什么“民航公司”，实际上是美国空军的一个附属机构。这次协助叛乱分子进行轰炸的美国飞行员都是由这个“民航公司”供给的，它是具体执行美国干涉计划的一个机构。“民航公司”批准鲍普的“请假”，正是为了让他去帮助叛乱分子进行轰炸，这恰恰更加证明了美国当局干涉印度尼西亚内政的罪行。
    利令智昏
    美国“新闻周刊”最近发表了它的一位高级编辑阿诺·德博什格列夫的一篇标题为“新非洲”、副题为“情况对西方有利……”的文章，鼓吹对非洲加紧进行经济侵略。
    作者写道：“这一个面积广阔的大陆能够容得下整个苏俄和整个中国。它是世界上最大的尚未开发的地区，然而却是世界上潜在的最富庶的地区。”在作了这样绘声绘色的介绍以后，作者就以非洲拥有大量富源而人民却穷得要命为理由，认为这“对西方最有利”。因为照作者的意见，针对这个弱点，美国要吞下这块肥肉只要“花钱、大量的钱”就行了。
    这套办法本来早已是华盛顿的口头禅。奇怪的是这位“刚在非洲十四个国家作了一万五千英里旅行归来”的编辑竟也对沸腾着的非洲民族独立运动熟视无睹。这除了是“利令智昏”以外，又能有什么解释呢。
