Japanese People Oppose the Establishment of Air Force Base

From May 18th to 23rd, the Kishi Nobusuke government transported a large amount of equipment to Hyakurigahara in Ibaraki Prefecture, intending to build a jet airport there. Angry farmers used their bodies to block trucks from entering, expressing that they would rather be crushed to death by trucks than allow their land to be turned into a military base.

The top picture shows the police dragging away farmers who were lying down to block the trucks. The bottom picture shows farmers fighting with the police.

    日本人民反对建立空军基地
    五月十八日至二十三日，岸信介政府运载大批器材到茨城县百里原，要在那里建筑喷气飞机场。愤怒的农民用身体阻止卡车开进来，他们表示宁可被卡车压死，也不让自己的土地变为军事基地。
