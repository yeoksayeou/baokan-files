Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 27th: According to a report in the "Japan News" weekly published on June 25th, Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, delivered a speech at the meeting of the "National Movement Implementation Committee for the Complete Implementation of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement" held on the 18th, thoroughly exposing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's recent pretense of "easing" its hostile attitude towards China. At the meeting, Kazami Akira pointed out that since the establishment of the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, Kishi Nobusuke and some of his cabinet members have been doing their utmost to spread preposterous fallacies, confuse right and wrong, and deceive the Japanese people, and have even attempted to shift the responsibility for the deterioration of Japan-China relations onto the Chinese side. Kazami Akira pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's so-called "to enhance mutual understanding between Japan and China" is very malicious. It means demanding that the Chinese side understand the imperialist reality that Kishi Nobusuke is colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee cliques to promote Japan's implementation of a nuclear rearmament policy.

Kazami Akira called on the Japanese people to be vigilant against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and thoroughly expose its new tricks to deceive the Japanese people.

    岸信介玩弄敌视中国的新手法
    风见章呼吁日本人民提高警惕
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：据6月25日出版的“日本新闻”周刊报道，恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章在18日举行的“完全实施第四次日中贸易协定国民运动实行委员会”会议上发表谈话，彻底揭穿岸信介内阁最近假装“缓和”其敌视中国的态度的骗局。风见章在会上指出，自从第二次岸信介内阁成立以来，岸信介和他的一些阁员极力散布荒唐无稽的谬论，混淆是非，欺骗日本人民，并且还妄图把日中关系恶化的责任推到中国方面去。风见章指出，岸信介所说所谓“要增进日中两国的相互理解”这句话是很恶毒的。它的意思是要求中国方面理解岸信介正在勾结蒋介石和李承晚集团，推行日本实行核武装政策的帝国主义的现实情况。
    风见章呼吁日本人民要对岸信介内阁提高警惕，彻底揭穿它欺骗日本人民的新手法。
