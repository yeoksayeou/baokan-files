    Gaoling Clay Discovered in Santai
    (Reported by this newspaper) Recently, the Suining Special District Geological Survey Team of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry's Bureau of Mining and Metallurgy, together with relevant departments of Santai County, discovered a mineral deposit in Shuanglong Township, Santai County, where a very rich deposit of bleaching earth, activated kaolin, and colored earth coexist. According to preliminary investigations, the area of this mining area is 172 square kilometers, with a thickness generally exceeding 2 meters, and a reserve of approximately 200 million tons or more. Among these, bleaching earth accounts for approximately 50%-60%, activated kaolin accounts for approximately 20%-30%, and colored earth accounts for approximately 15%-20%.
    These three types of soil are very fine and have a smooth surface, locally known by farmers as "stone surface" and also as "slurry powder" (farmers use it to starch clothes, with very good results). The colors include white, off-white, grayish-green, light red, peach red, purple, and several others. These three types of soil have a wide range of industrial uses and can be used as filling materials in the paper industry, and for their adsorption and refractive index in the paint industry. In the cosmetics industry, they can be used for various face powders, tooth powders, ointments, soaps, and rouge. In addition, they also have many uses in the construction industry, chemical industry, rubber industry, and handicrafts.

    三台发现高岭土
    本报讯  最近，四川省工业厅矿冶局遂宁专区地质查勘组会同三台县有关部门，在三台县双龙乡发现一个蕴藏量极为丰富的漂白土，活性高岭土，色土三者共生的矿藏。据初步查明，这个矿区的面积有一百七十二公里，厚度一般在二公尺以上，蕴藏量约有二亿吨以上。其中漂白土约占50％—60％，活性高岭土约占20％—30％，色土约占15％—20％。
    这三种土质都很细，表面滑润，当地农民称“石面”，又称“浆粉”（农民用来浆过衣服，效果很好）。色彩有白色、灰白色、灰绿色、浅红色、桃红色、紫色等几种。这三种土在工业上的用途都很广，可以作造纸工业的充填材料，油漆工业的吸附性和折光率。化装品工业上可以作各种香粉、牙粉、软膏、香皂、胭脂。此外，在建筑工业上、化学工业上、橡胶工业和手工艺上，也有很多用途。
