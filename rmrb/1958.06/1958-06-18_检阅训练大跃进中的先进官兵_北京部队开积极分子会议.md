Xinhua News Agency, June 17th. The Beijing Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a conference of activist representatives to review the advanced units and individuals that have emerged in the troop's training Great Leap Forward this year. The conference lasted eight and a half days and closed this morning.

A total of 230 representatives attended the conference. Among them were Li Jingang, a "soldier inventor" who invented 25 pieces of training equipment such as the "Rifle Shooting Breathing Checker"; Lieutenant Deng Jinan, who conducted 332 experiments and created the "One-Shot Multi-Purpose Shell" suitable for various artillery live ammunition shooting training; and Liu Zhichun, a new recruit who learned the movements of eight gunners in 21 hours and became an "all-around gunner."

Since the spring of this year, under the situation of the nationwide socialist construction Great Leap Forward, a training Great Leap Forward situation has emerged in the Beijing Troops. Many units and individuals are determined to take the lead in the Great Leap Forward and strive to be "Five-Good" companies, "Five-Good" platoons, and "Five-Good" soldiers. The artillery troops have launched a wave of enthusiasm for everyone to strive to be an "all-around gunner," while the signal corps have proposed that everyone should be a "dual-skilled signal soldier." In the competitive wave of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, officers and soldiers are not only full of enthusiasm but also dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to create. According to statistics from only eight units, by the end of May, more than 800 technical innovations and inventions had been examined and identified.

At the opening of the conference, General Yang Chengwu, Commander of the Beijing Troops, gave instructions, encouraging the representatives to: aspire to be at the forefront and always be the locomotive.

During the conference, 31 representatives made typical reports to the conference. All the representatives extensively exchanged experiences and observed more than 800 inventions and innovations. At the meeting, the training work of each unit this year was also evaluated.

The conference rewarded 12 "Five-Good" companies, platoons, and squads and eight "Five-Good" soldiers, and also awarded 21 officers and soldiers who have made significant contributions to training and work with a second-class merit each.

The conference elected Cui Huayun, Li Jingang and 19 others as representatives to attend the Second National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference.

    会议开幕时，北京部队司令员杨成武上将到会作了指示，勉励到会代表：立志争上游，永做火车头。
