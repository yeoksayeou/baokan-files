Spreading Bumper Harvest Experiences and Preparing for Increased Production
Anhui Province Holds On-site Wheat Production Increase Conference in Pidong First Cooperative

(Our Dispatch) Concurrently with launching mass wheat observation and comparison, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially convened a provincial on-site conference in the Pidong First Cooperative of Lu'an County, where wheat had achieved large-scale bumper harvests. The purpose was to summarize experiences and arrange preparations for next year's wheat crop.

Attendees expressed admiration for the Pidong First Cooperative's more than 2,200 mu of wheat, which averaged 800 jin per mu, believing that the wheat ears of Pidong First Cooperative had opened up their conservative minds. Many people came to visit with complacent attitudes. For example, the representatives from Yanjian and Lilou townships in Fengyang County said: "Walk a thousand miles, walk ten thousand miles, but the wheat there can't possibly grow better than along both banks of our Huai River." However, after they saw the wheat of the Pidong First Cooperative, they had to exclaim "There are heavens beyond the heavens," which resolved their complacency. A few people were skeptical about large-scale bumper harvests. As soon as they arrived at the Pidong First Cooperative, they went to look for bad wheat, but they could not find a single piece of low-yield wheat, which convinced them.

At the on-site conference, Zhang Shirong, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, put forward seven universally significant experiences from the Pidong First Cooperative's wheat bumper harvest, including ideological work, seed selection and storage, strip planting with close spacing, and fertilizer application and land preparation. He also conveyed the "Preliminary Opinions on Methods for Increasing Wheat Production Next Year" from the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, calling on all the representatives attending the meeting to raise the province's wheat yield even higher next year.

    传播丰收经验作好增产准备
    安徽省在淠东一社召开小麦增产现场会议
    本报讯　在开展群众性小麦参观评比的同时，中共安徽省委特地在小麦大面积丰产的六安县淠东一社，召开了全省性现场会议，总结经验，布置明年小麦的准备工作。
    到会者对淠东一社二千二百多亩小麦，每亩平均能收八百斤表示钦佩，认为淠东一社的麦穗子打开了他们保守的脑筋。有不少人怀着自满情绪来参观。如凤阳县严涧、李楼等乡的参观代表都说：走千走万，那里小麦还能长得比我们淮河两岸好。但当他们看过淠东一社的小麦以后，便不得不惊叹“天外有天”，解决了自满思想。少数人对大面积丰产抱怀疑态度，一到淠东一社就去找孬麦，可是没有找到一块低产麦，这才使他信服。
    在现场会议上，中共安徽省委农村工作部长张世荣对淠东一社的小麦丰产，提出了思想工作、种籽的精选和保管、条播密植、施肥整地等七条带有普遍意义的经验，并传达了省委农村工作部“关于明年小麦增产办法的初步意见”，号召全体到会代表把全省明年的小麦产量提得更高。　（石正章）
