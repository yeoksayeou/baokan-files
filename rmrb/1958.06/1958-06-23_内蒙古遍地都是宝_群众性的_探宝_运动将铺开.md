Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 22nd: The resource-rich Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is about to launch a larger-scale mass "treasure hunting" movement.

The results of vigorously carrying out mass prospecting and ore reporting activities in the past two months have led to the discovery of a large number of important mineral resources such as chromium, oil shale, iron, gold, and Iceland spar, as well as many mineral clues. Inner Mongolia's chromium resources are extremely rich. Recently, a promising chromite ore area was found on a grassland. Oil shale, an important raw material for synthetic petroleum, has also been continuously discovered recently. The reserves of oil shale mines discovered in Zhaowuda League and Jirem League alone amount to more than ten billion tons. The oil shale mine in the Urad Middle and Rear United Banner of Ulanqab League covers an area of 400 to 500 square kilometers and is also a very promising mining area. Recently, geological departments have discovered twelve iron ore deposits, five of which have been handed over to banners and counties for mining. The iron ore handed over to Wuchuan County for mining alone can meet the production needs of five small blast furnaces.

Now, the ore reporting activities of people of all ethnic groups are frequent. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Geological Bureau alone has recently received more than five or six hundred ore reporting letters. At present, many banners and counties are holding mass ore reporting conferences, imparting ore reporting knowledge, and training ore reporting personnel.

    内蒙古遍地都是宝
    群众性的“探宝”运动将铺开
    据新华社呼和浩特22日电  资源富饶的内蒙古自治区，将要展开更大规模的群众性“探宝”运动。
    最近两个月来大力开展群众性的找矿、报矿活动的结果，已经发现了铬、油母页岩、铁、金和冰洲石等大量重要矿产资源和很多矿产线索。内蒙古的铬矿资源极为丰富。最近在一块草原上又找到了很有希望的铬铁矿区。人造石油的重要原料油母页岩，最近也不断发现，仅昭乌达盟和哲里木盟等地已发现的油母页岩矿，储量就达十多亿吨。乌兰察布盟乌拉特中后联合旗油母页岩矿分布面积达四、五百平方公里，也是一个很有希望的矿区。最近地质部门已发现十二处铁矿，其中五处已交旗县开采，仅交给武川县开采的铁矿，就可满足五个小高炉生产之用。
    现在各族人民的报矿活动频繁，仅内蒙古自治区地质局最近接到的报矿信就有五、六百件以上。目前不少旗县正在召开群众性报矿会议，传授报矿知识，训练报矿人员。
