Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: According to the German News Agency, more than 700,000 workers in East German state-owned industrial enterprises are currently engaged in a vigorous socialist production competition in order to greet the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, scheduled to open on July 10th, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill production targets as a gift to the congress. Members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany have taken the lead in the competition. So far, the competition has yielded fruitful results.

    Almost every day, more factories respond to the call of the Risa Steel Plant, voluntarily increasing the tasks stipulated in the plan. For example, workers at the Brandenburg Steel Rolling Mill have increased the original national plan's crude steel output target by 10,000 tons and steel output target by nearly 15,000 tons. Workers at the Stalinstadt blast furnace decided to increase pig iron production by 30,000 tons beyond the planned target. 10,000 miners in the Senftenberg area have increased coal production by more than one million tons since the beginning of the year.

    In rural areas, farmers and tractor drivers have put forward new guarantees to increase the production of agricultural and animal husbandry products, as an expression of their trust in the policies of the Party and the government. Members of an agricultural cooperative and staff of a machine tractor station in northern East Germany have called on machine tractor stations and agricultural production cooperatives across the country to launch a widespread competition movement.

    民主德国职工开展生产竞赛
    迎接党第五次代表大会
    据新华社12日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，为了迎接预定在7月10日开幕的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，民主德国国营工业企业中目前正有七十多万职工投入了轰轰烈烈的社会主义生产大竞赛，争取完成和超额完成生产指标，作为向大会的献礼。德国统一社会党的党员们在竞赛中起了带头作用。到目前为止，竞赛运动已经取得了丰富的成果。
    几乎每天都有更多工厂响应里扎钢铁厂的号召，自愿增加计划规定的任务。例如，勃兰登堡轧钢厂的工人们把原来国家计划规定的原钢产量指标提高了一万吨，钢材产量指标提高将近一万五千吨。斯大林斯塔特高炉的工人们决定在计划指标之外增产三万吨生铁。森夫滕堡地区的一万名矿工从年初以来已经增产了一百多万吨煤。
    在农村，农民和拖拉机手提出了增产农畜产品的新保证，作为他们信任党和政府政策的表示。民主德国北部一个农业合作社的社员和一个机器拖拉机站的工作人员已经号召全国的机器拖拉机站和农业生产合作社广泛展开竞赛运动。
