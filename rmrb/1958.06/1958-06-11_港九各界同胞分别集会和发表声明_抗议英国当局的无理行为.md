Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th -- Hong Kong News: The recent unreasonable interference by the Hong Kong British authorities in the hanging of Chinese national flags by Chinese schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon has aroused great indignation and condemnation from compatriots of all strata in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Many schools, trade unions, organizations, and parents in Hong Kong held meetings to angrily protest and denounce the unreasonable behavior of the Hong Kong British authorities.

Hong Kong Han Wa Middle School, Chung Wah Middle School, Hailufeng Public School, and the children's school of the China Gas Company Employees Union recently, following some middle schools and labor children's schools, also revealed to Hong Kong society that these schools also encountered unreasonable interference from the Hong Kong education authorities when they hung the Chinese national flag to celebrate the "May Day" Labor Day this year. Teachers, students, and staff of these schools unanimously protested and expressed indignation at this practice of the Hong Kong education authorities that infringes upon the due rights of the Chinese people. Hong Kong Heung To Middle School, Pui Kiu Middle School, Yuk Kwan Middle School, Nam Chung Middle School, and Wei Wen School also expressed strong dissatisfaction with this unreasonable measure of the Hong Kong education authorities.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions recently held a plenary meeting of its council to protest the Hong Kong education authorities' unreasonable interference in schools hanging our national flag. The representatives pointed out that loving the motherland is the common aspiration of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, and hanging the national flag is the traditional custom and patriotic right of Chinese compatriots, which should be respected and must not be violated. It is unreasonable for the Hong Kong Director of Education to interfere with schools hanging the national flag under the pretext of not allowing schools to hang "political and semi-political" flags.

Thirty trade union groups, including Hong Kong Tramways, Telephone, Electricity, Postal, Dockyard, Textile Dyeing, Department Stores, Foreign Affairs, Printing, Motorcycle Industry, and Waterworks Unions, have also held meetings or issued talks and statements in recent days to support the actions of schools in safeguarding patriotic rights and condemning the unreasonable behavior of the Hong Kong Director of Education.

At the enlarged meeting of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Planting General Union held by representatives of farmers in Kowloon, Tai Po, Yuen Long, and Tsuen Wan districts, a resolution was unanimously passed to lodge a serious protest with the Hong Kong Director of Education.

More than 4,000 parents of students from the five labor children's schools under the Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association have also held meetings in recent days to protest the Hong Kong education authorities' interference with their children's schools hanging the national flag and other patriotic rights.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 1st – According to Hong Kong newspapers on the 1st, the person in charge of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association accused the Hong Kong British education authorities of interfering with Hong Kong schools hanging the Chinese national flag and infringing on the patriotic rights of Hong Kong compatriots.

The person in charge of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association told newspaper reporters that the five labor children's schools affiliated to the association were interfered with by the Hong Kong Director of Education when they hung the national flag on May 1st this year to celebrate International Labor Day. On May 3, Mao Qintong, the acting "Director of Education" of Hong Kong, sent a circular to the administrators of all labor children's schools, saying that the labor children's schools hanging the national flag on May 1 violated the "Education Ordinance" and the Director of Education's notice, requesting the schools to explain the reasons for hanging the flag, and to give the principal of the Mong Kok Labor Children's School, who hung the national flag, a "disciplinary action" by the management committee of the labor children's school.

A week before "May Day," the Hong Kong Director of Education issued a notice to the schools, reiterating the provisions of the "Education Ordinance" regarding schools not being allowed to hang so-called "political and semi-political" flags. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association lodged a verbal protest at the time against this notice, which was clearly intended to interfere with schools hanging the national flag on Labor Day.

The person in charge of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association said: The Chinese people hanging the national flag of their own country is a right that citizens of a country should have. Just as citizens of any country have the right to hang their own national flag, this patriotic right must not be violated. Labor schools have hung the national flag in previous years, why is it that today the Hong Kong British education authorities suddenly require an "explanation of reasons"? Is the intention to interfere with the patriotic rights of Chinese compatriots in schools? The person in charge pointed out that this move by the Hong Kong Director of Education is an extremely unfriendly act towards our country.

    港九各界同胞分别集会和发表声明
    抗议英国当局的无理行为
    新华社广州10日电　香港消息：香港英国当局最近无理干涉港九中国学校悬挂中国国旗，引起了港九各阶层同胞的极大愤慨和谴责。香港许多学校、工会、社团和学生家长分别集会，愤怒抗议和指斥香港英国当局的无理行为。
    香港汉华中学、中华中学、海陆丰公学和煤气公司华员职工会子弟学校最近继一些中学和劳工子弟学校之后，也向香港社会人士揭露，这些学校在今年庆祝“五一”劳动节时因为悬挂中国国旗也遭到香港教育当局的无理干涉。各该校的师生员工对香港教育当局这种侵犯中国人民应有权利的做法一致表示抗议和愤慨。香港香岛中学、培侨中学、育群中学、南中中学、卫文学校等也对香港教育当局这种无理措施表示强烈不满。
    港九工会联合会最近举行全体理事会议，抗议香港教育当局无理干涉学校悬挂我国国旗。代表们指出：热爱祖国是香港中国同胞共同的心声，悬挂国旗是中国同胞的传统习惯和爱国的权利，应该受到尊重，绝对不容侵犯。香港教育司用所谓不准学校悬挂“政治性及半政治性”旗帜的借口来干涉学校悬挂国旗是毫无道理的。
    香港电车、电话、电灯、邮务、船坞、纺织染、百货商店、洋务、印务、摩托车业和水务工会等三十家工会团体连日也分别集会或发表谈话和声明，支持学校方面维护爱国权利的行动，谴责香港教育司的无理行为。
    在九龙、大埔、元朗和荃湾等区农民代表举行的港九种植总公会扩大会议上，一致通过决议向香港教育司提出严重抗议。
    港九劳工教育促进会属下五所劳工子弟学校学生的家长四千余人，连日来也分别集会，抗议香港教育当局干涉他们子弟所在的学校悬挂国旗等爱国权利。
    新华社香港电　据香港报纸1日报道，港九劳工教育促进会负责人指责香港英国教育当局干涉香港学校悬挂中国国旗，侵犯香港同胞的爱国权利。
    港九劳工教育促进会负责人对报纸记者说，这个会所属的五所劳工子弟学校，在今年5月1日庆祝国际劳动节时悬挂国旗，曾受到香港教育司的干涉。5月3日香港代理“教育司”毛勤通函各所劳工子弟学校管理员，竟说劳工子弟学校在5月1日悬挂国旗是违反了“教育法例”和教育司的通告，要求学校对挂旗一事解释理由，并要劳工子弟学校管理委员会给予悬挂国旗的旺角劳工子弟学校校长以“纪律处分”。
    在“五一”节前一周，香港教育司曾向学校发出通告，重申了“教育法例”中关于学校不得悬挂所谓“政治性及半政治性”旗帜的规定。港九劳工教育促进会当时对这个显然企图干预学校在劳动节时悬挂国旗的通告曾提出口头抗议。
    港九劳工教育促进会负责人说：中国人民悬挂自己国家的国旗是一国公民应有的权利。正如任何国家的公民都有权利悬挂自己的国旗一样，这种爱国权利是不容侵犯的。劳工学校历年都悬挂国旗，为什么今天香港英国教育当局突然要求“解释理由”？其用意是否企图干涉学校中国同胞的爱国权利？负责人指出，香港教育司的这一举动是对我国极不友好的行为。
