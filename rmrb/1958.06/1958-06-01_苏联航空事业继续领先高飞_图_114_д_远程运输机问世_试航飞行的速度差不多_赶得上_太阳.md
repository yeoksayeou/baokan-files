Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th - According to a report in "Pravda" on the 30th, the Soviet Union has recently manufactured a new type of long-range transport aircraft, the "Tu-114д." During a test flight between Moscow and Vladivostok, flying from east to west in strong winds almost "kept up" with the sun. The "Tu-114д" is an improvement on the famous "Tu-114" turboprop giant aircraft designed by Tupolev, who has twice been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

Synthetic materials were widely used in the construction of this aircraft. Various parts made of plastic, plexiglass, and synthetic rubber were adopted. The "Tu-114д" has the most modern equipment and various piloting instruments, so that the entire flight, except for the selection of altitude, can be carried out by the autopilot. The operation of the aircraft's entire complex equipment is very simple, and the radio communication tools are powerful and reliable, enabling the aircraft to fly at any time of day or night. The "Tu-114д" aircraft has a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, with swept-back wings and tail. The aircraft is equipped with four high-power turboprop engines designed by Kuznetzov, Hero of Socialist Labor. The aircraft is capable of maintaining flight at an altitude of 10,000 to 12,500 meters, with an average flight speed of about 800 kilometers per hour. Despite its large weight, the takeoff run is not long.

The comfortable cabin in the fuselage is equipped with reliable insulation and soundproofing, as well as reclining seats, and maintains constant air pressure, normal temperature, and air humidity. Passengers will not feel any fatigue during long-distance flights.

The first flight of the "Tu-114д" aircraft was a non-stop flight from Moscow to Irkutsk and back to Moscow, covering a total of 8,600 kilometers. During the long flight at an altitude of 10,000 to 12,500 meters, the engines worked normally. After landing, the fuel remaining in the tanks was enough for a flight of 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers.

The second test flight was a high-altitude flight between Moscow and Vladivostok. It took nine hours to reach its destination after taking off from Moscow. This was the first non-stop flight for a passenger plane over such a long distance. A passenger train arrived in Vladivostok together with the "Tu-114д," but it had taken nine days and nights after leaving Moscow.

　　苏联航空事业继续领先高飞
    “图—114д”远程运输机问世
    试航飞行的速度差不多“赶得上”太阳
    新华社莫斯科30日电　据“真理报”30日报道，苏联最近又制成了一种新式远程运输机“图—114д”。在莫斯科和海参崴之间的一次试航中，它在大风中从东向西飞差不多“赶得上”太阳。“图—114д”是两次荣膺社会主义劳动英雄称号的图波列夫，对他设计的著名“图—114”涡轮喷气螺旋桨巨型飞机的一种改进。
    在建造这种飞机时广泛地采用了合成材料。采用了塑料、有机玻璃和合成橡胶制成的各种零件。“图—114д”具有最现代化的设备和各种帮助驾驶的仪器，使整个飞行过程中，除选择高度外，都可以通过自动驾驶仪来进行，飞机的整套复杂设备的操纵很简便，无线电通讯工具很强大可靠，使飞机在日夜任何时都能进行飞行。“图—114д”飞机的外形是张臂式的单翼飞机，它带有后掠机翼和尾翼。飞机上装有社会主义劳动英雄库兹?佐夫设计的四部大功率涡轮喷气螺旋桨式发动机。飞机能够保持在一万到一万二千五百公尺高空飞行，飞行的平均速度约为每小时八百公里，它的体重很大但是起飞滑跑却不长。
    机身中舒适的客舱设有可靠的隔热、隔音设备和靠椅。并且保持着固定的气压、正常的温度和空气湿度。长途飞行中不会使乘客感到有任何的劳累。
    “图—114д”飞机第一次飞行是从莫斯科到伊尔库次克再回到莫斯科的不着陆飞行，共飞行八千六百公里。在一万到一万二千五百公尺的高空中的长途飞行中，发动机工作正常。着陆以后，油箱中所剩的油还够飞行一千五百到两千公里的路程。
    第二次试航就是莫斯科和海参崴之间的高空飞行。它从莫斯科起飞后经过九小时就到达了目的地。这是客机在这样远的航程的第一次不着陆飞行。有一列客运火车同“图—114д”一起抵达海参崴，可是它离开莫斯科后一共走了九昼夜。
