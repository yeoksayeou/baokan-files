Xinhua News Agency, London, June 22nd. More than four thousand people from over fifty towns across Britain held a grand rally in London's Trafalgar Square this afternoon to oppose the manufacturing and testing of hydrogen bombs.

Despite the pouring rain, the number of participants in the rally continued to grow, eventually reaching seven thousand.

The rally was held at the call of the British "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament." The well-known peace movement leaders Reverend Collins and Dr. Soper spoke at the meeting.

The people participating in the rally issued a policy declaration demanding: "Britain, along with as many other countries as possible—but if necessary, even alone—should unconditionally renounce the production and use of nuclear weapons." The declaration stated: "We believe that Britain's possession of nuclear weapons is morally wrong and politically inappropriate." The declaration also explicitly rejected the so-called "nuclear deterrent" policy and demanded that the British government cease nuclear testing.

Copies of this declaration were sent to the Queen of England, the Prime Minister, leaders of all parliamentary parties, and religious leaders.

    伦敦七千人冒雨集会
    主张英国不要核武器
    新华社伦敦22日电  来自英国全国五十多个市镇的四千多人今天下午在伦敦特拉法加广场举行了反对制造和试验氢弹的盛大集会。
    虽然下着倾盆大雨，参加集会的人却愈来愈多，最后达到了七千人。
    这次集会是在英国“要求裁减核军备运动”的号召下举行的。著名的和平运动领袖柯林斯牧师和索佩尔博士在会上讲了话。
    参加这次集会的人们发表了一项政策宣言，要求：“英国同尽可能多的其他国家一起——但是如果必要的话，它也可以单独地——无条件地放弃生产和使用核武器。”宣言说：“我们认为，英国拥有核武器从道义上讲是错误的，从政治上看是不适当的”，宣言还明确表示拒绝所谓“核威慑”政策。并且要求英国政府停止核试验。
    这项宣言的抄件分别送交了英国女王、首相和议会各政党领袖以及宗教界的领袖。
