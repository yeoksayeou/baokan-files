Wheat monoculture is detrimental to production; Shaanxi promotes multi-variety wheat combinations

(Our report) To facilitate the management of wheat production and obtain stable and high yields, farmers in Shaanxi Province are vigorously promoting the combination of multiple wheat varieties in conjunction with the selection and replacement of improved seeds.

In 1951, Shaanxi Province began to promote the "Bima No. 1" improved wheat variety on the Guanzhong Plain. Due to the significant yield increase and wide adaptability of this variety, it was welcomed by the masses and quickly popularized. According to statistics from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, the cumulative planting area in the province over the past seven years totaled more than 48 million mu, with a total increase in wheat production of 2.4 billion jin. However, the situation of variety monoculture formed by the concentrated promotion of this improved wheat variety has also brought great difficulties to agricultural production. For example, during the summer harvest of 1956, continuous rain caused widespread sprouting of wheat due to its uniform maturity, resulting in a loss of approximately 200 million jin of wheat in the province. In 1957, "Bima No. 1" wheat was widely infected with yellow rust disease on both banks of the Wei River in the Guanzhong area, resulting in a loss of about 100 million jin of wheat.

To solve this problem, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture began to promote the combination of multiple wheat varieties in the autumn of last year. First, in the areas along the Wei River in Guanzhong, where wheat yellow rust disease was serious, the planting area of Bima No. 1 was greatly reduced, and improved wheat varieties such as "6028" with resistance to yellow rust were promoted. These wheat varieties have grown well this year, with yields increasing by 50% to 90% compared to last year.

In order to further develop the combination of multiple wheat varieties, Shaanxi Province is vigorously propagating new rust-resistant varieties "134" and "612" at 84 experimental points in 16 counties in Guanzhong and 7 state-owned farms this year. At the same time, in agricultural cooperatives in 15 counties including Huaxian, Mei County, Chenggu, Nanzheng, Pucheng, Sanyuan, and Jingyang, large-scale propagation of improved varieties such as "6028," Jinghui No. 26, No. 30, and Qitouhong is underway. At present, farmers in the above-mentioned counties have carried out rogueing and selection of this year's propagated improved varieties, with some areas beginning to harvest and transport simultaneously, ensuring that the improved seeds are transported to various places in a timely manner.

In early June, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture held meetings in Weinan, Wugong, and Luochuan respectively to further deploy the work of combining multiple wheat varieties in the province for next year. This year, the province will reduce the existing area of 14 million mu of Bima No. 1 by more than 4 million mu, and promote 3.8 million mu of 6028 improved variety, and more than 790,000 mu of Jinghui No. 26, No. 30, and Qitouhong and other improved varieties.

In order to smoothly carry out this work, in addition to publicizing the benefits of combining wheat varieties to the masses, cadres of agricultural departments at all levels use examples of demonstration comparisons of various wheat varieties in the local area over the years to explain the habits of various wheat varieties and their adaptability in different regions. They educate the masses to correctly grasp the habits and regional characteristics of local wheat varieties, so as to select improved wheat varieties in accordance with local conditions, and carry out multi-variety combinations according to different natural conditions, so as to ensure safe and increased wheat production in both normal and disaster years.

### 小麦良种单一化对生产不利  陕西推行小麦多品种组合

    小麦良种单一化对生产不利
    陕西推行小麦多品种组合
    本报讯　为了便于对小麦生产进行经营管理，并在小麦产量上获得稳定而高额的收成，陕西省各地农民正结合选换良种工作，大力推行小麦多品种组合工作。
    1951年，陕西省开始在关中平原推广“碧蚂一号”小麦良种，由于这个品种的增产效果显著，适应性大，因而受到群众欢迎，迅速得到普及。根据陕西省农业厅统计，七年来全省累计种植面积共四千八百余万亩，共增产小麦二十四亿斤。但是，由于集中推广这一小麦良种而形成的品种单一化的局面，也给农业生产带来了很大的困难。例如1956年夏收期间，阴雨成灾，小麦因成熟一致，收割不完，因而普遍出芽，全省共损失小麦约两亿多斤。1957年关中地区的渭河两岸，“碧蚂一号”小麦普遍感染黄锈病，损失的小麦也在一亿斤左右。
    为了解决这个问题，陕西省农业厅从去年秋季，开始推行小麦多品种组合工作。首先在关中渭河两岸小麦黄锈病严重的地区，大力压缩碧蚂一号的种植面积，推广抗黄锈病的“6028”号等小麦良种。今年这些麦子都生长良好，产量比去年提高50％到90％以上。
    为了进一步开展小麦多品种组合，陕西省今年在关中十六县八十四个试验点和七个国营农场，大力繁殖新的抗锈品种“134”和“612”良种；同时，在华县、郿县、城固、南郑、蒲城、三原、泾阳等十五县的农业社里，大面积繁殖“6028”、泾惠26号、30号和齐头红等良种。目前，上述各县农民对今年繁殖的良种已进行了去杂去劣，片选、穗选，有些地区已开始边打边运，保证及时把良种运往各地。
    6月初，陕西省农业厅分别在渭南，武功和洛川召开会议，对全省明年的小麦多品种组合工作，作了进一步的布置。全省今年要把现有的一千四百多万亩碧蚂一号面积缩减去四百多万亩，将推广6028号良种三百八十万亩，泾惠26号、30号和齐头红等良种七十九万多亩。
    为了顺利地开展这一工作，各地农业部门的干部除向群众宣传小麦品种组合的好处外，并以当地历年来各种小麦品种示范对比的事例，说明各种小麦品种习性及在不同地区的适应性。教育群众正确掌握当地小麦品种的习性和地区特点，做到因社因队因地制宜选择小麦良种，按照不同的自然条件，进行多品种组合，以便在常年与灾年的情况下，都能保证小麦安全增产。
