Xinhua News Agency, 8th, New York Dispatch: Some people and newspapers in the United States, commenting on the current economic situation in the United States, believe that they see no hope for a real improvement in the economic crisis soon.

The Joint Economic Committee of Congress released a report on the 5th, disagreeing with the US government's claim that the economy "will recover soon." The report said that even under optimistic assumptions and a fairly rapid rate of US economic recovery, there might still be 5 to 5.5 million unemployed American workers early next year. "If the recovery is not so rapid, then in the first quarter of next year, the number of unemployed could reach 7 million—or equal to more than 10% of the civilian labor force." The report pessimistically stated, "Economic activity is continuing to decline, and there are now very few signs indicating hope for an early improvement."

The Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce released figures on the employment and unemployment situation of American workers in May on the 6th. According to these two government departments, the total number of unemployed people in the United States in May was 4,900,400, a decrease of more than 200,000 from April. However, this figure did not bring much comfort to American business figures, because according to official sources, the decrease in unemployment in May was mainly due to seasonal increases in agricultural employment and some increases in construction projects. Even Labor Secretary Mitchell said that there may be more than 6 million unemployed people in June.

The June 2nd issue of "Newsweek," in predicting the US economic outlook, believed that an important factor determining the future prosperity or decline of US enterprises is investment, and unless the current downward trend in investment ends, it will be difficult for the US economy to have a "full recovery." However, the magazine pointed out that surveys show that the downward trend in US business investment does not appear to be ending soon, because in the manufacturing sector, which is most sensitive to overall business trends, the number of new appropriations that entrepreneurs earmarked in the first quarter of this year for investment in the coming months to more than a year continued to decline, a decrease of 43% compared to the first quarter of last year. Among them, new investment appropriations in the steel industry decreased by 71%, non-electrical machinery manufacturing decreased by 65%, the oil and coal industry decreased by 25%, and the metal smelting industry decreased by 12%. At the same time, the original investment appropriations for the entire manufacturing industry were also reduced by 31%.

Another factor that makes the American press believe that business activities will not improve soon is that entrepreneurs' new orders are still decreasing. According to reports, in April of this year, the number of new orders in manufacturing was only 24.2 billion US dollars, a decrease of 600 million US dollars from March.

### 投资继续下降  订货仍在减少  美国经济危机不会很快好转  美国许多经济界人士和报刊表示悲观

　　投资继续下降  订货仍在减少
    美国经济危机不会很快好转
    美国许多经济界人士和报刊表示悲观
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：美国一些人士和报刊在评论美国当前的经济形势时认为，看不出经济危机很快会有真正好转的希望。
    国会联合经济委员会5日发表了一个报告，表示不同意美国政府所谓经济“很快就会恢复”的说法。报告说，即使按照乐观的假设，美国经济恢复速度相当快，明年初期美国工人可能仍有五百万人到五百五十万人失业。“如果恢复速度不那末快，那末在明年第一季度中，失业者就能达到七百万人——或者说等于平民劳动力的10％以上。”报告悲观地说，“经济活动正在继续下降，现在还很少迹象表示有早日好转的希望。”
    劳工部和商务部6日公布了美国5月份工人就业和失业情况的数字。据这两个政府部门说，美国5月份的全失业人数为四百九十万零四千人，比4月份减少了二十多万人。但是这个数字并没有引起美国企业界人士多大的宽慰，因为据官方人士说，5月份失业人数减少主要是由于农业就业人数有了季节性的增加和建筑工程有些增加。甚至劳工部长密契尔也说，6月份可能失业者会有六百多万人。
    6月2日一期的“新闻周刊”在预测美国经济前景时认为，决定美国企业将来盛衰的一个重要因素是投资，除非目前投资下降的趋势结束，美国经济是很难有“充分的恢复”的。但是杂志指出，调查表明，美国企业投资下降趋势看来并不会很快结束，因为在对企业总趋势最为敏感的制造业部门，企业家在今年第一季拨出来的打算在今后几个月到一年多用来投资的新拨款数目继续下降，比去年第一季减少了43％，其中钢铁业的投资新拨款减少71％，非电力机器制造业减少65％，石油和煤炭业减少25％，金属冶炼业减少12％。同时，整个制造业原有的投资拨款也削减了31％。
    另一个使美国报刊认为企业活动不会很快好转的因素是企业家收到的新订货单仍在减少。据报道，在今年4月份，制造业新订货单的数目只有二百四十二亿美元，比3月份又减少了六亿美元。
