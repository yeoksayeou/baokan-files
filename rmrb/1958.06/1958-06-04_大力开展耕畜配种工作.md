Editorial: Vigorously Develop Livestock Breeding Work

On the basis of the great victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, and simultaneously with the great leap forward in agricultural production, many provinces have attached great importance to spring livestock breeding work and strengthened leadership in order to rapidly develop livestock and promote a high tide of agricultural and animal husbandry production, and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang, Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, Zhejiang, Hunan and other provinces have adopted various effective measures to implement the principle of more, faster, better and more economical results, vigorously mobilized the masses, and widely carried out livestock breeding and reproduction work. Many regions have proposed achieving "Four Completions" (complete breeding, complete accuracy, complete production, complete survival) or "Five Completions" (adding complete health) as their goals, and have achieved great results. However, from a national perspective, the development of livestock breeding and reproduction work is still uneven. Some places are not energetic enough, and even now have not yet carried out livestock breeding and reproduction work well. Party and government leading comrades in these regions should take up this work, mobilize and organize forces, take measures, and quickly change this situation to better carry out the livestock breeding and reproduction movement in their regions.

Animal husbandry is an important and organic component of the entire agricultural economy. It and agriculture are mutually dependent and supportive. It is necessary to comprehensively develop agricultural and animal husbandry production in order to continuously promote new upsurges in agricultural production. Stable and high-yield agriculture requires stable and high-yield animal husbandry. This can be fully demonstrated by the fact that animal husbandry provides animal power and fertilizer for agriculture, as well as accumulating funds for agriculture. According to a survey in Jilin Province, the value created by each head of draught animal in agricultural production power alone is enough to offset all feeding and management costs; the increased production value of the accumulated fertilizer and the value of hides, furs and meat are the net income from raising draught animals. Thus, each increase of a draught animal can provide approximately 460 yuan in net income for agricultural operations. In terms of the use value of draught animals, especially in the great leap forward in agriculture, the need for animal power has increased in all aspects, including deep plowing and careful harrowing, irrigation and drainage, hauling soil and delivering manure, and threshing and transporting grain. It is clear that with the high development of agriculture, the position of animal husbandry production in the agricultural economy is becoming increasingly important. In order to powerfully support the great leap forward in agricultural production, animal husbandry production must also develop at a correspondingly high speed.

The technological revolution in agricultural production has been put on the agenda, and agricultural mechanization is not a very distant matter, but there is still a process. If we simply wait for mechanization without paying attention to breeding draught animals, then it will be divorced from reality and impractical. At present, China mainly promotes improved agricultural tools and implements semi-mechanization, and the existing animal power is generally felt to be insufficient. Even in some places where mechanization can be implemented one step ahead, due to the original lack of draught animals, it will still be necessary to develop machinery and animal power simultaneously for a considerable period of time in order to meet the needs of agricultural production. Moreover, even when mechanized farming is realized in the future, draught animals will still be important auxiliary power. Therefore, whether it is from a national perspective or from the perspective of some areas that implement mechanization one step ahead, it is necessary to vigorously breed livestock while promoting semi-mechanization and mechanization.

Since the situation of a comprehensive great leap forward in agricultural production urgently requires strengthening the breeding of draught animals, can the breeding and reproduction rate of livestock be greatly improved at present? Countless advanced examples in various places have given an affirmative answer to this question. In Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, 67.7% of eligible mares conceived in 1957, and this year 10,974 foals can be produced, and it is estimated that at least 10,200 can survive, with a growth rate three times faster than in 1957. In Dangyang County, Hubei Province, from January to March this year, 45.4% of the county's 9,000 heads of breeding female livestock were bred, which is 685 heads more than the number bred in the whole year last year, and more than eight times the number bred in the same period last year. From the perspective of breeding speed, large livestock in Puxian County, Shanxi Province, increased by 54.7% during the first five-year plan period, with an average annual increase of 9.12%. In particular, even water buffalo, which are generally considered to have a low breeding rate, also have cases of very high breeding speeds. The New Construction Cooperative in Dongliu County, Anhui Province, had a water buffalo breeding rate of 91.5% in 1957, and the Taoyuan Township Joint Cooperative reached 79%. The above all shows that the potential for the development of draught animals is very large. As long as we overcome conservative thinking, strengthen leadership, and take various specific measures, it is entirely possible to greatly increase the net reproduction rate of draught animals.

At present, the spring plowing work in most areas has come to an end, which is the season to vigorously carry out livestock breeding work. In particular, this year's livestock are in better condition than in previous years, which is a favorable condition for achieving "Four Completions." All regions should follow the principle of "self-breeding, self-raising, and self-sufficiency" to solve the shortage of draught animals in agricultural cooperatives, seize the opportunity, promptly solve various specific problems in breeding work, and actively organize agricultural cooperatives to carry out draught animal breeding work.

In order to better and quickly carry out livestock breeding work, all regions should vigorously do the following work:

First, after the widespread and large-scale development of livestock breeding, the supply of breeding stock is a tense task. All regions should adopt the method of mainly selecting seeds locally to supplement the solution. Facts have proved that obtaining materials locally and selecting seeds locally is the fastest, best, and most economical way to solve the problem of insufficient breeding stock at present. For example, Henan Province selected more than 28,000 breeding male livestock through local selection and breeding methods, and also established more than 9,000 breeding stations, and the problem of breeding stock has been basically solved.

Second, conscientiously implement the mass line in breeding work, vigorously develop cooperative-run artificial insemination stations, and impart artificial insemination technology to the masses, so that the technology can take root in agricultural cooperatives. Only in this way can the effectiveness of excellent breeding male livestock be fully utilized and breeding costs reduced. Gansu Province plans to help agricultural cooperatives train breeding personnel and establish 280 cooperative-run breeding stations, and adopt a large number of artificial insemination methods. This practice is very good, and other regions can also emulate it. The breeding targets of existing state-run artificial insemination stations must also be appropriately increased.

Third, establish breeding bases for breeding stock. All regions should delineate areas for the local good breeds of livestock and establish bases to plan breeding and cultivation to supply the needs of the region and support other regions.

Fourth, in order to push the livestock breeding work to a new high tide, all regions should organize a comprehensive inspection, use the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, go deep into the front line, summarize and promote advanced and successful experiences in a timely manner, and widely carry out the competition movement of comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and being more advanced than the advanced, so as to create a upsurge in livestock breeding work.

In order to achieve "Four Completions," it is necessary not only to check the female livestock that have not been bred, but also to check the female livestock that have been bred but have not conceived, and supplement the breeding in a timely manner. Careful care should be taken for pregnant female livestock and newly born foals (calves). Particular attention should be paid to areas where the breeding work has just started and lack of experience. All regions should formulate methods for awarding and comparing achievements to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for breeding draught animals, and do a good job in livestock breeding and reproduction work in many ways, strive to change the face of draught animals in two or three years, and realize the requirement of the National Agricultural Development Program of "every agricultural production cooperative should have a sufficient number of strong draught animals" ahead of schedule.

### 大力开展耕畜配种工作

　　大力开展耕畜配种工作
    在整风和反右派斗争取得巨大胜利的基础上与农业生产大跃进的同时，很多省为了迅速发展牲畜，促进农、牧业生产高潮，提前实现农业发展纲要，对春季耕畜配种工作都非常重视，加强了领导。内蒙古自治区和黑龙江、河南、四川、甘肃、青海、浙江、湖南等省采取了各种有效措施，贯彻多快好省的方针，大力发动群众，广泛开展耕畜配种繁殖工作。许多地区提出实现“四全”（全配、全准、全产、全活）或“五全”（加上全壮）作为奋斗的目标，并已取得了巨大成绩。但从全国范围来看，耕畜配种繁殖工作开展得还不够平衡。有些地方劲头不大，甚至直到现在还没有把耕畜配种繁殖工作很好开展起来。这些地区的党政领导同志，应该把这一工作抓起来，动员和组织力量，采取措施，迅速改变这种状况，把本区的耕畜配种繁殖运动更好地开展起来。
    畜牧业是整个农业经济中的一个重要的有机的组成部分，它和农业是互相依存、互相支援的，必须全面地发展农牧业生产，才能不断地促进农业生产的新高涨。要有稳定高产的农业就必须有稳定高产的畜牧业，这从畜牧业为农业提供畜力、肥料，以及为农业积累资金等方面，可以得到充分的证明。据吉林省的调查，每头耕畜单在农业生产动力上所创造的价值，就足以抵住全部饲养管理费用；所积肥料的增产价值和皮毛肉的价值就是饲养耕畜的净收入。这样每增殖一头耕畜就大约可以为农业经营提供四百六十元左右的纯收益。从耕畜的使用价值上讲，特别在农业大跃进中，深耕细耙、灌溉排水、拉土送粪、碾场运粮，各方面都增加了对畜力的需要。很明显，随着农业的高度发展，畜牧业生产在农业经济中的地位越来越显得重要了。为了有力地支援农业生产大跃进，畜牧业生产也必须相应地高速度地发展。
    农业生产上的技术革命已经提到日程上来，农业机械化也并不是十分遥远的事情，但总还有一个过程，如果因此就单纯地等待机械化，不去注意繁殖耕畜，那就脱离现实，不切实际了。我国目前主要是推行改良农具，实行半机械化，现有畜力普遍感到不足。就是在某些可以先一步实行机械化的地方，由于原来役畜就不充足，在相当长的时期内，也还需要机械和畜力同时发展，才能满足农业生产的需要，而且就是在将来实现了耕作机械化、耕畜也还是重要的辅助动力。因此，无论就全国范围来说，或就某些先一步实行机械化的地区来说，在推行半机械化和机械化的同时，都要大力繁殖牲畜。
    既然农业生产全面大跃进的形势，迫切要求加强繁殖耕畜，目前牲畜的配种繁殖率能不能大大提高呢？各地无数先进事例，对这个问题作了肯定的答复。黑龙江省龙江县1957年适龄母马有67.7％配种受胎，今年可产驹一万零九百七十四匹，估计至少可活一万零二百匹，增长速度比1957年快三倍。湖北当阳县今年1至3月份全县九千头可繁殖的母畜，有45.4％配了种，比去年全年配种数多六百八十五头，比去年同期配种数增加八倍多。从繁殖速度上看，山西省蒲县第一个五年计划期间，大牲畜增长了54.7％，每年平均增长9.12％。尤其是一般认为繁殖率低的水牛，也有繁殖速度很高的事例，安徽东流县新建社1957年水牛繁殖率达91.5％，桃源乡联合社达79％。以上都说明耕畜发展潜力是很大的。只要克服保守思想，加强领导，采取各项具体措施，大大提高耕畜的净增殖率是完全可以做到的。
    目前，大部地区春耕工作已经告一段落，正是大力开展耕畜配种工作的季节，特别今年的牲畜膘头比往年好，是实现“四全”的有利条件。各地应根据“自繁、自养、自给”的方针来解决农业社耕畜不足，抓紧时机，及时解决配种工作中的各项具体问题，积极组织农业社进行耕畜配种工作。
    为了更好地把耕畜繁殖工作迅速地开展起来，各地应该大力作好下列工作：
    第一，普遍地大量地开展耕畜配种之后，种畜供应是一个紧张的工作，各地应该采取就地选种为主的办法补充解决。事实证明，就地取材、就地选种是当前解决种畜不足的问题的多快好省的办法，如河南省通过就地选育的办法，共选出两万八千多头种公畜，还建立了九千多个配种站，种畜问题基本上得到了解决。
    第二，认真贯彻配种工作中的群众路线，大量发展社办的人工授精站，把人工授精技术传授给群众，使技术在农业社内扎根。只有这样，才能做到充分发挥优良种公畜的效能，减少配种成本。甘肃省计划帮助农业社训练配种人员，建立社办配种站二百八十个，大量采取人工授精的办法。这种作法很好，其他地区也可以仿效。现有国营人工授精站的配种指标也必须适当地提高。
    第三，把种畜繁殖基地建立起来。各地应将当地的良好畜种，划定地区建立基地，有计划地繁殖培育，以供应本地区需要和支援外区。
    第四，为了把耕畜配种工作推向一个新的高潮，各地区应该组织一次全面检查，用抓两头带中间的办法，深入现场，把先进的成功的经验及时进行总结与推广，广泛开展比先进、赶先进和先进更先进的竞赛运动，使耕畜繁殖工作造成热潮。
    为了实现“四全”，不但要检查没有配种的母畜，还要检查已配未受胎的母畜，适时补配。对于已怀孕的母畜、新生的幼驹（犊），要加意爱护。特别是在新开展配种工作缺乏经验的地区尤应注意。各地区应该规定出奖励评比办法，鼓励群众繁殖耕畜的情绪，从多方面把耕畜配种繁殖工作做好，争取在两、三年内改变耕畜面貌，提前实现农业发展纲要规定的“每一个农业生产合作社都要有足够数量的强壮的耕畜”的要求。
