The First Red Flag
——An Account of How Yu Jiang County, Jiangxi Province, Fundamentally Eliminated Schistosomiasis

Yu Jiang County in Jiangxi Province has planted the first red flag on the national schistosomiasis prevention and control front—the first to fundamentally eradicate schistosomiasis, adding a new page to the history of schistosomiasis science in the motherland. Scientists believe this is an unprecedented feat.

Admitting Defeat

Professor Cheng Chongyi, Dean of Studies at Jiangxi Medical College, said: “I have been engaged in medical work for sixteen years in the old society and have never heard of, let alone seen, anywhere that has ever eradicated schistosomiasis. In the literature of capitalist countries, there is no mention of schistosomiasis being eradicable. Now I have not only heard about it, but I have also seen it with my own eyes.” Those scholars who used to think that "foreign countries dare not do it, and China can't do it either" are now convinced and admit defeat in the face of this fact.

The process of eradicating schistosomiasis in Yu Jiang County is also a process of struggling against various erroneous ideas and achieving victory. In the spring of 1956, after the high tide of cooperativization arrived, the Yu Jiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the people of the county, relying closely on the superior conditions of cooperativization, and bravely put forward the plan of "half a year of preparation, one year of fighting, and half a year of mopping up" to eliminate schistosomiasis with bitter struggle in two years, setting off a comprehensive schistosomiasis prevention and control campaign. After the movement started, some people did not see this huge change clearly and asserted that "this plan is bragging"; some scientific and technical personnel came not so much to guide the work as to spread pessimistic views. They said: "The Kuomintang ruled for more than twenty years without making any progress; Japan worked for decades without eradicating it; scientists in other countries have studied it back and forth without coming up with a good solution. How can the Communist Party eliminate schistosomiasis empty-handed?" These scholars neither believed in the Party and the masses, nor did they believe in themselves. The people of Yu Jiang forcefully refuted these pessimistic views. They not only did what they dared not think or do in the past, but they also did it well. Before cooperativization, the Jiantou Village of Xishe Commune in Ni Guixiang did not fill in an old ditch in eliminating snails because it was not organized and could not uniformly arrange labor and adjust the distribution of ditches. Some people concluded that "to fill in the old ditches in Jiantou Village and eliminate snails, it will take decades even if your beard turns white." But after the establishment of the cooperative, this argument was completely bankrupt. The people of Jiantou Village used the collective power to fill in all the old ditches in a few months and built a new irrigation network.

In the treatment work, they broke with conventions with revolutionary spirit and boldly adopted new methods of treatment. The old three-month, two-month, and twenty-day therapies were replaced by the new three-day and two-day therapies. Without medicine, they used local methods; when there were not enough hospital beds, they broke it down into smaller units, going deep into the communes, teams, groups, and households for treatment. Some medical experts were superstitious about authority and stubbornly clung to the long-term therapies in books, insisting that the three-day and two-day therapies would kill people. The facts are the best answer: of the more than four thousand mild and severe patients treated here, all but three severe patients were cured.

After a battle to eradicate schistosomiasis, the people of Yu Jiang greatly developed the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to be original. They said to the cadres: "In the future, as long as the Communist Party and Chairman Mao issue a call, if you hold the ladder, we will dare to go to heaven."

Two Different Folk Songs

"Lantian Slope, a granary for grain, 490 jin last year, 1,000 jin this year," is a folk song sung by the people today to Lantian Slope, the granary of Yu Jiang County, known as a fertile field. Two years ago, the folk song sung by the people was: "The rice of Lantian Slope, one basket harvested per mu, happy for two people to carry, unhappy for one person to carry." These two folk songs vividly show the sharp contrast in production before and after the eradication of schistosomiasis in Lantian Slope.

Lantian Slope is fifty li in radius. In the past, due to the harm of schistosomiasis, more than 3,000 people died from schistosomiasis in Lantian Slope in the past 50 years, more than 20 villages were completely destroyed, and more than 14,000 mu of farmland became wilderness. Most of the remaining people also had big bellies, were sallow and thin, and could eat but not work. They described their labor situation as: "A hoe weighs two catties of iron, and you want to rest when you get it in your hand; go to the field with a cane, and you want to sleep before you get to the field." In order to maintain the minimum living, people still went to the fields with their big bellies to work hard, cultivating that small part of the farmland. Due to rough cultivation, lack of water and fertilizer, each mu only yielded dozens of catties of rice. In case of disaster, there was even no harvest at all. In addition to the exorbitant taxes and levies of the reactionary government, the people struggled on the verge of death. After liberation, although the people gained freedom, the disease was not eliminated, production could not develop rapidly, and the living standard improved slowly. 40% of the farmers still relied on government loans and relief to survive.

In 1956, Lantian Slope began large-scale prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. At that time, the Party and the government sent doctors to diagnose people, and the first secretary of the county Party committee personally directed the battle. The 30,000 people of Lantian Slope were extremely happy and determined to fight hard for two years to eliminate schistosomiasis.

Within two years, the people of Lantian Slope realized their wishes, eliminated snails, established a vertical and horizontal water conservancy and irrigation system, eliminated drought, and increased more than 1,500 mu of good farmland; more than 4,000 patients were all treated and recovered their health. Those who used to "want to rest as soon as they picked up the hoe" now become: "Work from morning to night, the more you work, the more energetic you become." Because the disease was cured and nature was transformed, the great development of production was promoted. The people's living standards have risen by leaps and bounds. Last year, the grain yield per unit area rose to more than 400 jin, and the high yield reached more than 500 jin. The grain-deficient areas became surplus grain areas, and the poor households became well-off households. In the past, Magang Township had to rely on the state for 2,000 yuan in relief and 70,000 jin of public grain exemption every year; after the elimination of schistosomiasis, this township sold 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state last year, and the average income per person increased from 38 yuan in 1953 to 74 yuan.

Youth Returns to Jiantou Village

People living in Jiantou Village, Ni Guixiang, often asked to move out of Jiantou Village, or plant fields in Jiantou Village without living in Jiantou Village. Jin Dongle, whose son was taken away by schistosomiasis, went to the township government once or twice to get a migration certificate, determined to leave Jiantou Village. After schistosomiasis was eradicated, both he and his wife recovered from their illnesses, and their lives greatly improved. His wife also gave birth to a baby, and now he no longer goes to the township government to ask for a migration certificate. The people of Jiantou Village are now like Jin Dongle, determined to settle in Jiantou Village forever.

Fifty years ago, Jiantou Village had more than 500 households and more than 1,500 people; within 50 years, some were tortured to death by schistosomiasis, and some were forced to flee. By the time of liberation, only eight households and twenty-four people remained in this village, and everyone had a big belly, unable to engage in production, and their lives were extremely poor. The village became lifeless and shocking. In the short period after the eradication of schistosomiasis, Jiantou Village has now increased to twenty-one households and fifty-four people; everyone is strong and healthy, and every household is living a prosperous life. The village is filled with a joyful atmosphere everywhere. People gratefully said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao saved Jiantou Village."

Like this village that was on the verge of destruction and then regained its youth, there are two or three in almost every commune in the epidemic area of Yu Jiang County. These villages are increasing in population year by year and expanding year by year.

Changes in the Family

In the Xishe Agricultural Cooperative of Ni Guixiang, the reporter interviewed female commune member Deng Rumei. This rural woman, who is less than thirty years old, has a black and red face, and you can tell at a glance that she is very strong.

Deng Rumei held the baby in her arms, and she happily and excitedly told the reporter about the changes in her family.

Deng Rumei married Jin Shenghua, a farmer in the same village, when she was eighteen years old, and lived a good life with her mother, a family of three. But soon she contracted schistosomiasis, and quickly changed from being strong to being listless, sallow and thin, with a belly as big as a leather drum. Three years and five years passed, and she still had no children. The old mother blamed Deng Rumei for not being ambitious and not bringing happiness to the family; her husband also changed, disliked her sallow and thin face, her inability to have children, her slow pace, and her panting as soon as she picked up the hoe, complaining that he was unfortunate to marry such a wife, and the relationship between the two sides was very disharmonious.

In 1956, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao sent doctors to examine and treat schistosomiasis for Deng Rumei's family. The examination results showed that all three members of the family needed treatment. But they did not believe that the doctor could cure them, saying that it was because the "dragon vein was not good" that they got the big belly disease, and they refused treatment. After the doctor explained it again and again, they understood the principle that schistosomiasis makes people have big bellies and cannot produce and reproduce, and then they went to treatment with a surprise.

After the illness was cured, the health of the family quickly recovered. People became fatter, their bellies became smaller, they walked more easily, they had more energy to participate in labor, and with the improvement of life, there was laughter in the family. A year later, Deng Rumei became pregnant, which was a great joy for the whole family. In order to welcome the newborn baby, they also added new mosquito nets, quilts and clothes. After the baby was born, life became more affectionate and harmonious. Deng Rumei said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of our family." The change in Deng Rumei's family is the epitome of the changes in thousands of families in the schistosomiasis epidemic area of Yu Jiang County.

    第一面红旗
    ——记江西余江县根本消灭血吸虫病的经过
    江西日报记者　陈秉彦　本报记者　刘光辉
    江西余江县在全国血吸虫病防治工作战线上插上了第一面红旗——首先根除了血吸虫病，给祖国血吸虫病科学史上增添了新的一页。科学家们认为这是一个史无前例的创举。
    甘拜下风
    江西医学院教务长程崇圯教授说：“我在旧社会从事医务工作十六年，从来没有听说过更没有看见过哪里曾经根除了血吸虫病，在资本主义国家的文献里，根本找不到血吸虫病可以消灭这一条。如今我不仅听到了，而且亲眼看到了。”那些过去认为“外国不敢做，中国更办不到”的学者，在这一事实面前，现在也心悦诚服，甘拜下风。
    余江县根除血吸虫病的过程，也是向各种错误思想作斗争并取得了胜利的过程。1956年春天合作化高潮到来后，中共余江县委领导全县人民，紧紧依靠着合作化的优越条件，勇敢地提出了“半年准备，一年战斗，半年扫尾”的苦战两年消灭血吸虫病的计划，掀起了全面歼灭血吸虫病的防治运动。运动开始后，有的人没有看清这种巨大的变化，就断言“这个计划是吹牛皮”；某些科学技术人员，与其说是前来指导工作，不如说是来给大家散布悲观论调。他们说：“国民党统治时期搞了二十多年，没有搞出什么名堂；日本搞了几十年，也没有把它消灭；别的国家的科学家研究来研究去，都没有弄出个好办法，难道共产党能赤手空拳把血吸虫病消灭掉？”这些学者们既不相信党和群众，也不相信自己。余江人民有力地驳斥了这些人的悲观论调。他们不但把过去不敢想不敢做的事情干起来了，而且也干好了。倪桂乡西坂社建头村在合作化前两年内，因为没有组织起来，不能统一安排劳力和调整沟渠的分布，消灭钉螺中没有填平一条旧沟，有人就从而断言：“要把建头村的旧沟填平，消灭钉螺，不等胡子白，也得几十年。”可是合作社建立后，这个论调彻底破产了。建头村的人民运用集体力量，在几个月内就填平了全部旧沟，并且修成了一个新的灌溉网。
    在治疗工作上以革命精神打破常规，大胆采用新法治疗。陈旧的三月疗法、二月疗法、二十天疗法，都为新的三日疗法和二日疗法所代替。没有药品，用土办法；病床不够，就化整为零，深入社、队、组、户进行治疗。有的医学专家迷信权威，死啃住书本上的长期疗法不放，硬说三日、二日疗法会死人。事实是最好的答复：这里治疗过的四千多个轻、重病患者，除三个重患者外全部治愈。
    经过一场根除血吸虫病的战斗后，余江人民大大发扬了敢想敢做敢独创的共产主义精神。他们对干部说：“今后只要共产党和毛主席发出号召，你们扶梯子，我们就敢上天。”
    两首不同的山歌
    “蓝田坂，粮食屯，去年四百九，今年一千斤”，这是人民今天歌唱号称沃野万里的余江县粮仓蓝田坂的一首山歌。两年前，人民唱的另一首山歌是：“蓝田坂的禾，亩田割一箩，高兴两人抬，不高兴一人驮”。这两首山歌生动的唱出了蓝田坂根除血吸虫病前后生产上的鲜明对比。
    蓝田坂方圆五十里。过去由于血吸虫病为害，在近五十年内，蓝田坂有三千多人因患血吸虫病死亡，有二十多个村庄完全毁灭，有一万四千多亩田地变成了荒野。剩下的人也大多挺着大肚子，面黄肌瘦，能吃不能劳动。他们形容自己的劳动情形是：“一个锄头两斤铁，拿到手里就想歇；下田扶根棍，不到田头就想困”。为了维持最低生活，人们还是挺着大肚子勉强下地劳动，耕种那一小部分田地。由于耕作粗糙，缺水少肥，每亩只收稻谷数十斤，碰上灾害，甚至颗粒无收，再加反动政府的苛捐杂税，人民在死亡的边缘上挣扎。解放后，人民虽获得了自由，但是疾病未除，生产不能迅速发展，生活水平提高很慢，40％的农户还是依靠政府贷款和救济过日子。
    1956年蓝田坂开始了大规模防治血吸虫病的工作。那时，党和政府派来医师给人们诊病，县委第一书记亲自来指挥战斗，蓝田坂的三万人民高兴极了，决心苦战两年消灭血吸虫病。
    两年内蓝田坂人民实现了自己的愿望，消灭了钉螺，还建立了一个脉络纵横的水利灌溉系统，消灭了旱灾，并增加了一千五百多亩良田；四千多个患病者全部得到了治疗，恢复了健康，那些过去“拿起锄头就想歇”的人现在变得：“一天干到晚，越干越起劲。”由于治好了疾病和改造了自然，促进了生产的大发展。人民生活水平飞跃上升。去年粮食单位面积产量上升到了四百斤以上，高的达五百多斤，缺粮区变成了余粮区，贫困户变成了富裕户。马冈乡过去每年要靠国家救济二千元，免公粮七万斤；消灭了血吸虫病后，去年这个乡卖给国家的余粮有三十万斤，每人平均收入由1953年三十八元跃增到七十四元。
    青春回到了建头村
    住在倪桂乡建头村的人，过去经常要求迁出建头村，或者种建头村的田地不在建头村住。被血吸虫病夺去了儿子的金冬仂一两天上趟乡政府要迁移证，坚决要求离开建头村。根除了血吸虫病后，他和妻子的病都好了，生活有很大改善，妻子还生个娃娃，现在再也不上乡政府要迁移证了。建头村的人们现在都和金冬仂一样，下定决心永远在建头村安居立业了。
    建头村在五十年前有五百多户，一千五百多口人；五十年内，有的被血吸虫病折磨死了，有的被迫外逃了，到解放时这个村只剩下八户，二十四口人，并且个个挺着大肚子，无力搞生产，生活极贫困，村子里变得死气沉沉，令人触目惊心。根除了血吸虫病后的短时期内，建头村现在增到二十一户，五十四口人；个个身强力壮，户户过着富裕的日子，村子里到处洋溢着欢乐的气氛。人们感激地说：“共产党和毛主席救活了建头村。”
    像这样临近毁灭又恢复了青春的村庄，在余江县疫区几乎每个社都有两、三个。这些村庄年年增加人口，年年扩大。
    家庭里的变化
    在倪桂乡西坂农业社里，记者访问了女社员邓汝梅。这个不到三十岁的农村妇女脸上黑里透红，一看就知道身体很强壮。
    邓汝梅抱着婴儿，她高兴而激动地向记者叙述了她的家庭的变化。
    邓汝梅十八岁时与同村的农民金盛华结了婚，和母亲一起全家三口，生活过得很不错。可是不久她便患了血吸虫病，很快就由身强力壮变得精神萎靡不振，面黄肌瘦，肚子大得像个皮鼓。三年、五年过去了，她还没有生小孩，老母亲责怪邓汝梅不争气，不给家庭添福；丈夫也变了，嫌她面黄肌瘦不好看，不生育儿女，走起路来慢吞吞，拿起锄头就喘气，抱怨自己不幸娶了个这样的老婆，双方感情很不融洽。
    1956年共产党和毛主席派来医生给邓汝梅一家检查和治疗血吸虫病，检查结果一家三人都需要治疗。但他们不相信医生能治好，说是因为“龙脉不好”得了大肚子病，竟拒绝治疗。经过医师再三解释，明白了血吸虫病使人大肚子不能生产和生育的道理后，才怀着又惊又喜的心情去治疗。
    治好病后，一家人的身体很快恢复了健康。人长胖了，肚子变小了，走起路来轻快方便，参加劳动有了劲，随着生活的改善，家庭里开始有说有笑了。一年后，邓汝梅怀了孕，这是全家的大喜事。为了迎接出生的小娃娃，还添置了新的蚊帐、被子和衣服。小娃娃出生后，日子过得更亲热和睦了。邓汝梅说：“共产党和毛主席是我们一家的救命恩人。”邓汝梅的家庭变化是余江县血吸虫病流行区千百个家庭变化的缩影。
