    Hand-Pushed Wooden Harvester
    Ten Times More Efficient Than Sickle Harvesting
    The carpenters of Bintang Agricultural Cooperative in Nali Township, Qin County, Guangdong Province, recently made a lightweight, hand-pushed wooden harvester. This harvester can be used to cut wheat and harvest rice. After several tests, the results were good. Two to three people operating it can harvest fifteen mu of rice per day, which is about ten times more efficient than using a sickle.
    The harvester has four large wheels, with ten small wheels in the middle of the large wheels, arranged on both sides. The large and small wheels on each side are fitted with interconnected wheel belts, and the large wheels are connected to the ground wheel. The disc harvesting knife is installed horizontally at the bottom between the front two large wheels, about a few inches from the ground. The entire structure is: the ground wheel drives the large wheels, and the large wheels drive the small wheels and the disc sickle. When the ground wheel rotates, the large and small wheels and the sickle also rotate. At this time, the crop lifter pulls the crop inside (four rows of crop at a time), and the disc sickle rotates to cut the crop. After the crop is cut, it is transferred by the wheel belt to the rope on the binding wheel (the rope is placed horizontally at the entrance of the crop). Because the rope is movable, it gradually loosens as it is impacted by the crop, until the binding frame is full of crop. (Attached picture)

### 手推式木制收割机  比镰刀收割提高效率十倍

    手推式木制收割机
    比镰刀收割提高效率十倍
    广东省钦县那丽乡湴塘农业社的木工们最近制成了一种轻便的手推式木制收割机。这种收割机既可用来割麦，又可收获水稻。经过几次试验，效果良好。两至三个人操纵，一天能收割水稻十五亩，比用镰刀收割提高效率十倍左右。
    收割机共有四个大转轮，在大转轮中间有十个小转轮，分列两边，每边的大、小转轮都装上互相联系的轮带，而大转轮又和地轮衔接着。圆盘割禾刀横装在前面两个大转轮中间的底层，离地面约数寸。整个结构就是：地轮带动大转轮，大转轮带动小转轮和圆盘镰刀。地轮一转动，大、小转轮和镰刀也跟着转动。这时候，抄禾板把禾拔进里面（一次四行禾），圆盘镰刀旋转着把禾割下；禾割下后被轮带转送到捆绳轮的绳上时（绳横放在禾的入口处），由于绳子是活动的，被禾一冲就逐渐放松，一直到捆禾架上装满了禾为止。（附图片）
