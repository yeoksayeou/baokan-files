Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 22nd (Dispatch from our correspondent Yang Xiaonong): There is a noteworthy trend in the current French political situation: Just as ultra-rightists are clamoring for the establishment of a single party based on the so-called "Committee of Public Safety," several bourgeois parties in France are also brewing a reorganization. Currently, Maurice Faure of the Radical Socialist Party has proposed establishing a union from the right-wing leader of the Socialist Party, Mollet, to the leader of the "Independent Party," Pinay. This situation illustrates that while monopoly groups are making every effort to push France further towards fascistization, the contradictions within the ruling class are further developing.

The infighting among various factions within the French ruling clique to safeguard their own interests is one of the fundamental reasons for the long-term instability of the French political situation and the constant changes of government. As everyone knows, with the French people increasingly turning to the left, the bourgeois right-wing parties do not have a majority of votes. However, the left-wing majority, which could be formed both nationally and in parliament, cannot be realized due to the stubborn anti-communist attitude adopted by the right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party. As for the so-called centrist forces, they are fragmented. In this situation, the French ruling clique has been using the coalition of centrist forces and right-wing elements to barely maintain its rule since the 1956 general election. This characteristic can be seen from the composition of successive governments.

However, as France's domestic and foreign policies, especially its colonial policy towards Algeria, have been repeatedly thwarted, leading to further deepening of various contradictions within French imperialism, it has become difficult to cope with the situation using the aforementioned methods. The ultra-rightists representing the colonial interests of North Africa's monopoly groups are deeply concerned that the parties representing the interests of French domestic enterprise monopoly groups may tend to resolve the Algerian issue through negotiations because they are worried that the economic expansion of their monopoly groups will be affected by the Algerian War. Therefore, in addition to constantly exerting pressure on the latter, the ultra-rightists are also making every effort to seize power. Coupled with the rising movement of the French people demanding a ceasefire through negotiations on the premise of recognizing the independence of the Algerian people, the French ruling clique's past tactic of using centrist parties to deceive the people while actually implementing policies that satisfy the interests of the ultra-rightists has failed. In this situation, the ultra-rightists launched a coup, attempting to further suppress the people and subdue the part of the bourgeoisie that tended towards reconciliation.

According to some publications here, De Gaulle, who came to power with the support of the fascist coup group, is facing the increasingly acute problem of contradictions within the ruling clique. It seems that De Gaulle will first appear as an arbitrator. For example, he has absorbed some figures who are dissatisfied with the ultra-rightists into the new cabinet, while actually implementing the policies of the ultra-rightists. Then, he will gradually abolish the democratic elements in the current French system, and finally embark on the path of complete dictatorship through the passage of the so-called new constitution. The ultra-rightists are now openly saying that the current De Gaulle government is only the first step in the transition.

It can be predicted that as De Gaulle's dictatorial face becomes increasingly exposed, the irreconcilable conflicts within the French ruling clique will inevitably become more and more superficial and intensified. Currently, De Gaulle's act of preventing ministers from reporting to the committees of the National Assembly has aroused dissatisfaction among some Socialist Party members and so-called centrist party members. Observers here link this matter to the brewing reorganization of French bourgeois parties, especially the so-called centrist parties. They believe that the brewing reorganization of centrist parties reflects the panic of these parties as they see their strength declining and their desire to try to preserve their political position.

    法统治集团内部矛盾加深
    极右翼分子急于实现法西斯化
    所谓中间党派正设法联合自保
    新华社巴黎22日电  本社记者杨效农报道：目前法国政局中有一个值得注意的动向：正当极右翼分子叫嚣要建立以所谓“救国委员会”为基础的单一政党的时候，法国若干资产阶级党派也正在酝酿重新组合。现在，激进社会党的莫里斯·富尔已经提出要建立从社会党右翼领袖摩勒到“独立党”领袖比内的联合。这种情况，说明了：在垄断集团竭力把法国进一步推向法西斯化的同时，统治阶级内部的矛盾正在进一步发展。
    法国统治集团内部各派系为维护自身的利益而互相倾轧，这是法国长时期以来政局不稳定以及政府不断更迭的根本原因之一。大家知道，在法国人民日益向左转的情况下，资产阶级右翼政党是没有多数票的。但是，无论在全国还是在议会中都可能组成的左翼多数，又由于社会党右翼领导机构采取顽固的反共态度，而无法实现。至于所谓中间力量，则是分崩离析的。在这种情况下，法国统治集团从1956年大选以来一直就利用中间力量和右翼分子的联合组阁，来勉强维持其统治。从历届政府的组成中都可以看出这个特点来。
    但是，随着法国对内、对外政策特别是对阿尔及利亚的殖民政策的到处碰壁而引起法国帝国主义各种矛盾的进一步深刻化，要再用上述这种办法来应付局面就很困难了。代表北非殖民利益的垄断集团的极右翼分子，深恐代表法国本土企业垄断集团利益的党派因为担心本垄断集团的经济扩张受阿尔及利亚战争影响而趋向于以谈判方式解决阿尔及利亚问题。因此，极右翼分子除了一直对后者施行压力以外，还竭力设法使自己掌握政权。再加上法国人民要求在承认阿尔及利亚人民独立的前提下谈判停战的运动高涨，法国统治集团过去利用中间党派来迷惑人民而实际上却执行满足极右翼利益的政策的手法，已经失灵。在这种情况下，极右翼分子就发动了政变，企图借此进一步压制人民，并且压服倾向于和解的那一部分资产阶级人士。
    据此间一些刊物分析，由法西斯政变集团支持上台的戴高乐正在面对着统治集团内部矛盾更加尖锐化的难题。看来，戴高乐将首先以仲裁者的面孔出现。例如，他在新内阁中吸收了一些为极右翼分子所不满的人物，同时实际上又执行极右翼的政策。然后，他将通过逐步取消法国现行制度中的民主成分，以至最后经由所谓新宪法的通过而走上完全独裁的道路。极右翼分子现在已经公开说，目前的戴高乐政府只是过渡的第一步。
    可以预料，随着戴高乐的独裁者面貌的日益暴露，法国统治集团内部无法消除的矛盾冲突必然会越来越表面化和激烈化。目前，戴高乐不让各部部长向国民议会各委员会报告工作的行径已经引起一部分社会党议员和所谓中间党派议员不满。此间观察家把这件事同法国资产阶级政党首先是所谓中间党派的酝酿重新组合联系起来看。他们认为，中间党派的酝酿重新组合，反映了这些党派眼看到自己的力量日趋低落的惶恐情绪以及竭力设法保存自己政治地位的心情。
