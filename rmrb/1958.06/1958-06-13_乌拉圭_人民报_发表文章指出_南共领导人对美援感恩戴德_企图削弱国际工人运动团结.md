Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The Uruguayan Communist Party's organ, "People's Daily," published an article on May 12th entitled "Correct Criticism of the Yugoslav Program." The full text is as follows:

    "El País" shamelessly fabricated facts regarding the criticisms made by various Communist and Workers' Parties of the theories in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. "El País" said that the difference of the Yugoslav leaders is that they believe: "The goal of socialism is one; but its paths are various; every nation has the right to choose the path it likes and that suits it; state relations should be built on the principles of independence and complete equality."
    The welcome of this pro-imperialist newspaper for the theories in the program of the Yugoslav leaders has attracted people's attention. But the actual situation is that "El País" is telling a blatant lie.
    Lenin taught that on a fundamental common basis—the dictatorship of the proletariat—every nation will have its own unique forms in socialist construction. This has been proven by the Chinese revolution and the socialist development of the European people's democracies. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed that the increasingly diverse forms of transition to socialism were entirely possible. Even due to the new balance of power in the world, the Congress proposed that those forms do not necessarily have to be linked to civil war under all conditions.
    There is no disagreement on this point between the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. They may disagree with certain forms of the Yugoslav system, but that is not the issue under debate. The disagreement lies in the theories contained in the Yugoslav program regarding the international situation and other pseudo-Marxist-Leninist principles. Let us now look at one of the main theories of this program. The Yugoslav leaders equate the imperialist aggressive blocs with the socialist camp fighting for peace. The program repeatedly echoes the "Soviet Empire" fabricated by imperialist propaganda and its "desire for hegemony and spheres of influence."
    The division of the world into two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system—is an objective fact. Any Communist Party, while putting forward the task of defending peace and opposing the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive blocs, also puts forward the task of consolidating the socialist camp and the unity of the Communist Parties of various countries, in order to develop the world socialist system and oppose the conspiracies of the reactionaries. The Yugoslav leaders do not think so. However, the international communist movement cannot turn a blind eye to this revisionist stance.
    On the other hand, the fact that socialism in each country can have its own forms based on its national characteristics cannot affect the main fact: socialist countries should unite against the common enemy, not only should not one country oppose another, but it is best that each socialist country should make use of the economic and political power of the socialist camp.
    The relations between the countries of the socialist camp are precisely an example of sharing weal and woe, because the basis of this relationship is independence and equality, but also mutual assistance. This is contained in many documents concerning the relations between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, but it is also the practical experience of this relationship. In addition, socialist countries provide selfless assistance to all countries that want to develop their economies independently, and pursue the principle of peaceful coexistence internationally.
    However, despite the brotherly assistance provided by the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav leaders not only regard the Soviet Union as a strong country "seeking hegemony," but it is also noteworthy that these leaders emphasize the kindness of U.S. aid. If the trap of U.S. "aid" is today a universally recognized fact in the world, if today in Latin American countries—look at the reception of Nixon—people understand what is hidden behind this so-called "aid," and even bourgeois leaders condemn the United States, then one should ask: What are the conditions for U.S. aid to Yugoslavia? As "Pravda" asked: "But what do they hope to get in return?" "Is it because the Yugoslav leaders are trying to weaken the international workers' movement?"
    Therefore, the criticism of the Yugoslav program is by no means an interference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. The Yugoslav leaders presented a program to the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries; these parties disagreed with the fundamental theories in the program and did not want to participate in the Congress in order to avoid a debate. However, considering that one of the conditions for the great fortress of the communist movement is to uncompromisingly defend Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, they cannot but express their disagreement with revisionist theories.

    乌拉圭“人民报”发表文章指出
    南共领导人对美援感恩戴德  企图削弱国际工人运动团结
    新华社12日讯　乌拉圭共产党机关报“人民报”5月12日刊载了一篇题为“对南斯拉夫纲领的正确批评”的文章。全文如下：
    “国家报”就各国共产党和工人党对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中的理论所进行的批评无耻地捏造事实。“国家报”说，南斯拉夫领导人的不同点是他们认为：“社会主义目的是一个；但是它的道路是各种各样的；每一个民族都有权选择它所喜欢的和适合于它的道路；国家关系应该建筑在独立和完全平等的准则上。”
    这家亲帝国主义的报纸对南斯拉夫领导人纲领中的理论的欢迎引起了人们的注意。但是实际情况是，“国家报”撒了弥天大谎。
    列宁教导说，在一个根本的共同基础——无产阶级专政——上，每一个民族都将在社会主义建设中有它自己独特的形式。这一点已经被中国革命和欧洲人民民主国家的社会主义发展所证明。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会认为，向社会主义过渡的形式日益多样化是完全可能的。甚至由于世界上新的力量对比，代表大会提出，那些形式不是在一切条件下都必须和内战联系在一起的。
    各国共产党和工人党与南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间关于这一点没有任何分歧。它们可以不同意南斯拉夫制度的某些形式，但是这并不是正在争论的问题。分歧在于南斯拉夫纲领所包含的关于国际形势和关于其他假冒马克思列宁主义原则问题的理论。我们现在来看看这个纲领的一个主要理论。南斯拉夫领导人把帝国主义侵略集团同为和平而斗争的社会主义阵营等量齐观。在纲领中一再重复帝国主义宣传所捏造出来的“苏联帝国”以及它“对霸权和势力范围的渴望”。
    世界划分为两种制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度是一个客观事实。任何一个共产党人在提出保卫和平、反对帝国主义侵略集团阴谋活动的任务的同时，也都提出巩固社会主义阵营和各国共产党团结的任务，以便发展世界社会主义体系和反对反动派的阴谋活动。南斯拉夫领导人并不这么想。但是，国际共产主义运动却不能对这种修正主义立场熟视无睹。
    另一方面，每一个国家的社会主义可以根据本国特点而有它自己的形式这一情况不能影响到这一主要事实：社会主义国家应该团结起来反对共同的敌人，不仅不要一个国家反对另外一个国家，而且最好每个社会主义国家去利用社会主义阵营的经济和政治威力。
    社会主义阵营各国间的关系恰恰是休戚相关的范例，因为这种关系的基础是独立和平等，但是也还有互相援助。这一点包含在苏联同其他社会主义国家关系的许多文件中，但它也是这种关系的实践经验。此外还有，社会主义国家向一切想独立地发展经济的国家提供无私的援助，并且在国际上奉行和平共处的原则。
    然而，尽管苏联对南斯拉夫进行了兄弟般的援助，南斯拉夫领导人不仅把苏联看成一个“寻求霸权”的强国，而且引起人们注意的是，这些领导人强调美援的恩德。如果美国“援助”的圈套今天已是世界上所公认的事实，如果今天在拉丁美洲国家——请看对尼克松的接待——人民明白了这个所谓“援助”后面所隐藏着的东西，甚至连资产阶级领袖都谴责美国，那么就应该问问：美国援助南斯拉夫的条件是什么呢？正如“真理报”所问：“然而它们希望换得些什么呢？”“是因为南斯拉夫领导人企图削弱国际工人运动吧？”
    因此，对南斯拉夫纲领的批评根本不是什么干涉南斯拉夫内政。南斯拉夫领导人向各国共产党和工人党提出了一个纲领；这些党不同意纲领中的根本理论，不想参加代表大会，以免激起一场论战。但是，考虑到共产主义运动伟大堡垒的一个条件是毫不妥协地保卫马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，它们不能不表示它们同修正主义理论的分歧。
