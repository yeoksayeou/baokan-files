Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Vienna, June 3rd (TASS): The Executive Committee of the World Peace Council held an expanded meeting in Vienna from May 31st to June 2nd.

The members of the Promotion Committee for the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference also participated in the meeting.

The meeting adopted an appeal to the people, stating that only in a peaceful environment can the people of all countries be freed from the hateful burden of armaments, can human and material resources be used for the benefit of mankind, and can the people of all countries establish completely new political and economic relations on an equal footing.

All people who yearn for peace should meet in order to find ways to overcome the difficulties that hinder governments from reaching the disarmament agreement that everyone hopes for (including supervision of disarmament), so that the people of all countries can carry out close cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for national independence.

The appeal to the people stated that this is the purpose of the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference. The appeal to the people calls on everyone to discuss these issues, study ways to solve these problems, and send their representatives to Stockholm in order to strive to prevent war and establish lasting peace. The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference is scheduled to open in Stockholm on July 16th this year.

    号召积极参加争取裁军大会
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社维也纳3日讯：世界和平理事会执行委员会从5月31日到6月2日在维也纳举行了扩大会议。
    争取裁军和国际合作大会促进委员会的委员们也参加了这次会议。
    会议通过了一项告人民书说，只有在和平的环境中各国人民才能摆脱令人痛恨的军备负担，人力和物力资源才能为人类造福，各国人民也才有可能在平等的基础上建立全新的政治和经济关系。
    一切渴望和平的人们应该会面，以便找寻途径克服妨碍各国政府达成大家所盼望的裁军协议（包括对裁军的监督）的困难，以便使各国人民在互相尊重国家独立的基础上实行紧密的合作。
    告人民书说，这就是争取裁军和国际合作大会的宗旨。告人民书号召大家讨论这些问题，并且研究解决这些问题的办法和派遣自己的代表到斯德哥尔摩，以便争取防止战争和建立持久和平。争取裁军和国际合作大会定在今年7月16日在斯德哥尔摩开幕。
