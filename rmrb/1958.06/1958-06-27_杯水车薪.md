A Drop in the Bucket

The French government of de Gaulle is loudly touting its financial "achievements" since coming to power. This "achievement" is that the recently issued government bonds have been subscribed to the tune of more than 50 billion francs.

However, it is not difficult for people to see from the newspapers the serious financial difficulties facing the de Gaulle government. In terms of government spending alone, this year's estimated overspending is 200 billion francs; and next year's budget deficit is estimated to double this year's, reaching 1.2 trillion francs. Needless to say, the main reason for this is the ever-increasing war costs in Algeria.

The issuance of government bonds is actually a pre-payment of taxes. This is because the money the government borrows from the capitalists will eventually have to be repaid by the taxpayers. Whether this can be counted as a financial "achievement" is debatable. But even so, compared with the increase in military spending in Algeria, the proceeds from government bonds are just a drop in the bucket and can hardly solve the problem. The de Gaulle government's attempt to cover up its financial difficulties by boasting about "achievements" is obviously impossible.

    杯水车薪
    法国戴高乐政府正在为它上台后取得的财政上的“成就”大吹大擂。这个“成就”是，最近发行的公债认购数已达五百多亿法郎。
    但是，人们从报纸上也不难看到戴高乐政府面临的严重财政困难。仅就政府开支来说，今年预计要超支二千亿法郎；而明年的预算赤字估计将比今年增加一倍，达到一万二千亿法郎。其所以会这样，不消说，主要原因是阿尔及利亚的战费日益巨大。
    发行公债，实际上是赋税的预支。因为，政府从资本家那里借的这笔钱，以后还是要由纳税人来负责归还的。这是否可以算财政“成就”，姑且不说。但是即使这样，公债所得同阿尔及利亚军费的增加相比，也不过是杯水车薪，难济于事。戴高乐政府想用吹嘘“成就”的办法来掩饰财政困难，显然是办不到的。
