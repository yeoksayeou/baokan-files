The Thirteen Tombs Reservoir is named for its location in the area of the Ming Dynasty's thirteen imperial tombs. It is located approximately 100 li from Tiananmen. The reservoir lies across the Shahe tributary of the Wenyu River in Changping District. The reservoir area is 10 li long and 7 li wide, covering an area of 5.5 million square meters.

This is a mountainous area, with larger mountains including Tianshou Mountain, Jiangfeng Mountain, Shuangfeng Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Hu Mountain, Long Mountain, Mang Mountain, etc. During the rainy season, mountain floods from the 217 square kilometer basin converge into the Wenyu River, often causing floods.

The main project of this reservoir, the flood-control dam, is built between Mang Mountain and Hanbao Mountain. It is 29 meters high (including 1 meter for the road base on the west dam top), 618 meters long, 7.5 meters wide at the top, and 179 meters wide at the bottom. The total reservoir capacity is 60 million cubic meters, equivalent to twenty times the size of Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace. At the western end of the dam is a spillway with a bottom width of 15 meters and a length of 341 meters. In addition, there is an intake tower, water transmission pipes, and a hydroelectric power station. The spillway can discharge part of the particularly large floods. The water transmission pipes can deliver 1 million cubic meters of water daily during the irrigation season. The earthwork for the flood control dam alone amounted to more than 1.8 million cubic meters.

This reservoir can control mountain floods from a basin area of 217 square kilometers, reducing downstream flooding; irrigate more than 250,000 mu of land, increasing grain production by 50 million jin; generate 240,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually; produce more than 2 million jin of fish annually; and regulate rainfall and climate in nearby areas.

Currently, the builders of the reservoir are embedding the five large characters "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir" calligraphed by Chairman Mao in white marble on the south dam face. At the site where Chairman Mao inscribed the words – a large granite pier on the south side of the dam – a showroom will be built to house exploration, design, and construction data and related documents of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir.

The Thirteen Tombs area has many scenic spots and historical sites. In addition to the Ming Tombs, there are also the picturesque Conical Stone Pass, the ever-flowing Jiulong Pond, the precipitous Desheng Pass, a ginkgo tree with one root growing 124 trees, and the Immortal Cave formed naturally by stalactite drips. Currently, a plan for the Thirteen Tombs scenic area centered on the reservoir is being formulated. Various fruit trees and flowers will be planted around the reservoir. On the east and west sides of the reservoir, a new socialist village is being planned, where farmers relocated from the reservoir area will live.

    十三陵水库介绍
    十三陵水库因建在明朝十三个皇帝陵墓所在地而得名。它离天安门约一百里。水库横拦在昌平区温榆河的沙河支流上，库区长十里、宽七里，面积为五百五十万平方公尺。
    这是一片多山的地区，较大的有天寿山、将逢山、双凤山、凤凰山、虎山、龙山、蟒山等。每逢雨季，这二百十七平方公里流域内的山洪就汇入温榆河，经常泛滥成灾。
    这座水库的主体工程——拦洪大坝，是修在蟒山和汉包山之间，高二十九公尺（包括西坝顶马路基厚一公尺），长六百一十八公尺，顶宽七公尺半，底宽一百七十九公尺。总库容为蓄水六千万立方公尺，相当于颐和园内昆明湖的二十倍。大坝西头有一条底宽十五公尺、长三百四十一公尺的溢洪道，另外还有进水塔、输水管和水电站。溢洪道可以下泄一部分特大的洪水。输水管在灌溉季节每天能输水一百万立方公尺。拦洪大坝的工程，仅土方就达一百八十多万立方公尺。
    这个水库，可以控制二百十七平方公里流域面积的山洪，减轻下游的涝灾；灌溉二十五万多亩地，能增产五千万斤粮食；每年能发电二十四万度；每年产鱼二百多万斤；还能调节附近地区的雨量和气候。
    现在，水库的建设者正在用汉白玉把毛主席题的“十三陵水库”五个大字镶嵌在大坝的南坝面上。毛主席在工地题字的场所——大坝南侧古迹花岗石砌成的大墩台上，将建一座陈列室，放置十三陵水库的勘探、设计、施工资料和有关文件。
    十三陵地区有很多名胜古迹。除明十三陵以外，还有山明水秀的锥石口，泉水长流的九龙池，悬崖削壁的德胜口，一棵树根上生长着一百二十四棵树的白果树，钟乳石自然滴成的仙人洞等。现在，以水库为中心的十三陵风景区规划正在制订中。水库周围将满植各种果树花木。在水库东西两侧，正在筹建一个社会主义新村，由水库区迁移出来的农民将居住在这里。
