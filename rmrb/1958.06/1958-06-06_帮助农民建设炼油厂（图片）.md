　　Helping Farmers Build Refineries
　　The workers of the Yumen Oil Mine Refinery built a small refinery for the Xihu Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Yumen City. The workers displayed the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and boldly creating. In just two days, with an investment of 75 yuan, they completed all the design and construction work of the small refinery. The entire equipment of this factory is only a large oil drum and some scrap steel pipes. The refining process is simple, and people who don't understand technology can learn it in just one hour.

　　This small refinery can produce 200 to 300 tons of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel per year, which is enough for two cars, three tractors, and lighting for 600 farmers in the agricultural cooperative.
　　The workers of the refinery are installing the refining furnace for the agricultural cooperative.
　　The cooperative members saw the first batch of gasoline they refined themselves.
　　The agricultural cooperative uses kerosene refined by themselves for lighting.

    玉门油矿炼油厂的职工为玉门市郊西湖农业社建设了一个小炼油厂。职工们发挥了敢想敢干、大胆创造的精神，只用两天时间，花七十五元的投资，就把小炼油厂的设计和建设工作全部完成了。这个厂的全部设备只是一只大油桶和一些废钢管，炼油过程简单，不懂技术的人，只要一个小时就能学会。
    这个小炼油厂每年能产汽油、煤油、柴油等二百至三百吨，足够农业社两辆汽车、三台拖拉机和六百户农民点灯之用。
　　炼油厂的工人替农业社安装炼油炉。
　　社员们看到了自己炼出来的第一炉汽油。
　　农业社用自己炼的煤油点灯。
