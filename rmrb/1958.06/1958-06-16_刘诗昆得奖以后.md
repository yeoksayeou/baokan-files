    Liu Shikun won an award in the international piano competition, and we are all very happy. However, though equally happy, our ideas are different.
    One group says: This proves that only by learning foreign things can we achieve success. If we learn Chinese national things, and the competition programs are playing works by foreign great composers, we have no hope of winning awards.
    Another group says: If we don't win awards, we don't win awards. We are serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the love of the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the highest award.
    I agree with the latter attitude. However, I would like to add a few more opinions. Because the latter statement does not answer the question raised by the former: Is it really only by playing foreign works that one can win awards in international competitions? Is learning Chinese national things not up to international standards?
    No one advocates completely rejecting learning good things from foreign countries, and no one advocates stopping learning works by musical masters from various countries. We are not the kind of people who close ourselves off. Our music academies are not doing this now, and will not do this in the future. However, our learning from foreign countries is to serve the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to creatively develop China's socialist national new music. At the same time, we are fundamentally different from those who are full of inferiority. We believe that, contrary to what some people think, it is only a temporary phenomenon that only European composers' works are played in international music competitions, and not Chinese composers' works. It is also only a temporary phenomenon that the organizers and venues of international music competitions are in other countries, not the People's Republic of China, not Beijing and Shanghai. The reason why this phenomenon is temporary is that the musical genius of the Chinese people, the endless power of the Chinese people in the field of musical art, has not been fully expressed or has not been recognized by people. After the great socialist revolution, the talents of the Chinese people in other aspects have already begun to erupt like volcanoes and have begun to be recognized by people; the musical talents of the Chinese people must also be expressed and must also be recognized by people. Six hundred million people, six hundred million people who have carried out earth-shattering revolutions, if they do not create a large number (not a few) of great composers and great musicians, that would be truly strange.
    The programs of international music competitions should not only play works from other countries, but also play works by Chinese composers; not only Chinese musicians, but all musicians from various countries participating in the competition should play Chinese works; not only in European cities, but also in Chinese cities, to hold "Beijing Spring", or "Shanghai Spring", or "Nie Er Spring" in Kunming, where there is spring in all seasons. Will such days have to come in the very distant future? No, in not too long, we can see this day.
    There is only one condition here, which is to get rid of inferiority, dare to imagine that what others can do, we can also do; what others have not done, we can also do; and dare to work in a down-to-earth manner, dare to boldly develop the Chinese people's own musical art. We have not heard of any country that has given birth to its own great musicians because of simply imitating foreign countries, nor have we heard of anyone who has become a great composer because of kneeling at the feet of others, nor have we heard of any country that has been respected by people because it has no creation. Only those who have greatly developed the national musical art, loved by the people of their own country, and added wealth to the general treasure house of world music, are worthy of respect, is there any doubt about this? Musicians who love their own people, never leave the people for a moment, learn from the people wholeheartedly, grow up on the milk of the people, and dedicate everything to the people, musicians who are both red and expert, are qualified to represent the Chinese people on the stage of international music competitions, and will be respected by people, is there any doubt about this?
    Yes, "We are serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the love of the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the highest award." I would like to add a sentence: Musicians who serve the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers and receive the highest awards from the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers are qualified to receive the world's highest awards, because the whole world belongs to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our direction is right, grasp this direction, go all out, move forward courageously, we will surely win. June 7

    刘诗昆得奖以后
    张春桥
    刘诗昆在国际钢琴比赛中得了奖，我们大家都很高兴。但是，同样高兴，想法却不同。
    有一派说：这一下子证明了只有学外国的东西才有出息，我们学中国民族的东西，人家比赛的节
  目，却是演奏外国大作曲家的作品，我们没有什么得奖的希望了。
    另一派说：我们不得奖就不得奖，我们是为工农兵服务，工农兵喜欢就是最高的奖赏。
    我是赞成后一种态度的。但是，还想补充一点意见。因为后一种说法并没有解答前一种说法所提出的问题：果然只有演奏外国的作品才能在国际比赛中得奖吗？学习中国民族自己的东西，就赶不上国际水平了吗？
    没有谁主张根本拒绝学习外国的好东西，也没有谁主张停止学习各国音乐大师的作品。我们不是那种闭关自守的人。我们的音乐学院，现在没有这样做，将来也不会这样做。但是，我们学习外国，是为了给中国的工农兵服务，是为了创造性地发展中国的社会主义的民族的新音乐。同时，我们同那种充满自卑感的人根本不同。我们认为，同某些人想的恰恰相反，在国际音乐比赛中，只演奏欧洲作曲家的作品，而不演奏中国作曲家的作品，这只是暂时的现象。国际音乐比赛的主持者和演奏地点一定是别的国家，而不是中华人民共和国、而不是北京和上海，这也只是暂时的现象。这种现象所以是暂时的，就是中国人民的音乐天才，中国人民在音乐艺术领域中的无穷无尽的力量，还没有充分地表现出来，或者还没有被人们认识到。经过伟大的社会主义革命，中国人民在别的方面的才能已经开始像火山似地爆发出来了，已经开始被人们承认了；中国人民的音乐才能也一定要表现出来，也一定要被人们承认。六万万人，干出了惊天动地的大革命的六万万人，不造就出一大批（不是几个）大作曲家、大音乐家，那才真是怪事。
    国际音乐比赛的节目，不但要演奏别的国家的作品，也要演奏中国作曲家的作品；不但中国音乐家，凡是参加比赛的各国音乐家都要演奏中国作品；不但在欧洲的城市，而且要在中国的城市，举行“北京之春”、或者“上海之春”、或者在四季皆春的昆明举行“聂耳之春”，这样的日子，难道要很遥远的将来才能到来吗？不会的，用不到多久的时间，我们就可以看到这一天了。
    这里只有一个条件，就是打掉自卑感，敢于设想别人能做到的，我们也能做到；别人没有做到的，我们也能做到；并且敢于脚踏实地地工作，敢于大胆地发展中国人民自己的音乐艺术。我们没有听到过有哪一个国家因为单纯地模仿外国而诞生了自己的大音乐家的，也没有听说过有哪一位是因为跪倒在别人的脚下而成为大作曲家的，也没有听说过有哪一个国家因为没有任何创造而受到人们的尊敬的。只有本民族音乐艺术大发展，为本国人民所喜爱，并为世界音乐的总宝库增加了财富的人，才值得人们尊敬，这难道有什么疑问吗？热爱自己的人民，一刻也不离开人民，全心全意地向人民学习，吃人民的奶汁长大、把自己的一切都献给人民的音乐家，又红又专的音乐家，才有资格代表中国人民走上国际音乐比赛的舞台，才会受到人们的尊敬，这难道有什么疑问吗？
    是的，“我们是为工农兵服务的，工农兵喜欢就是最高的奖赏。”我想补充一句：为中国的工农兵服务，得到中国工农兵最高奖赏的音乐家，才有资格得到世界的最高奖赏，因为全世界都是属于工农兵的。我们的方向是对的，抓住这个方向，鼓足干劲，勇往直前，我们一定胜利。　6月7日
