    Torreya grandis, also known as torreya, pizi, yufei, chiguo, and yushan fruit, is the seed of the Torreya grandis tree. It is a unique and valuable specialty of China. The Soviet scientific research department once transported some Torreya grandis seeds and seedlings from China for introduction experiments; Vietnam and Czechoslovakia also transported a batch of Torreya grandis seedlings as exhibits.
    Torreya grandis belongs to the Torreya genus of the Taxaceae family. There are six species of Torreya trees in the world, one in Japan, two in North America, and three in China. Torreya grandis is the best of these six species. Its seeds are characterized by being uniform in size, thin-shelled, rich in kernels, fragrant in taste, and high in yield.
    Torreya grandis is an evergreen tree with linear leaves and oval or elliptical seeds covered with a purplish-red aril. The Torreya grandis tree blooms in April and May, and the seeds mature in October of the following year. After the torreyas are collected, they are piled up and sprinkled with water to rot the seed coat. After a few days, they are washed with clean water, dried in the sun, and baked with charcoal fire. When half-cooked, sprinkle a little cold water to separate the skin from the fruit, then add salt and bake dry to become crispy salted torreyas.
    Torreya generally contains 41.89% oil, 10% protein, 4% fat, 28% carbohydrates, 2.6% ash, and 13.51% other components. It can be pressed for oil, fried (baked) and eaten, or used as an anthelmintic drug.
    The distribution range of Torreya grandis is not wide, and it is only produced in Zhuji, Shaoxing, Shengxian, Dongyang in Zhejiang and Yixian in Anhui. Zhuji produces the most, and Dongxi Township in Fengqiao District of the county has been cultivating and managing Torreya grandis trees for more than 1,000 years. Torreya grandis has a ten-year period of high yield. After that, depending on the management technology and climatic conditions, the harvest varies from year to year. An ordinary Torreya grandis tree can produce 50 to 70 catties of torreya in a fruitful year, and up to 200 to 300 catties in abundant years.

    香榧子别称榧子、披子、玉榧、赤果、玉山果，是香榧树的种子。这是我国特有的一种名贵特产。苏联科学研究部门曾从我国运去一些香榧种子和苗木，作引种试验；越南和捷克斯洛伐克也运去一批香榧苗作展览品。
    香榧属紫杉科的榧属树木。榧属树木，世界上共有六种，日本产一种，北美洲产两种，我国产三种。香榧是这六种中最优良的一种。它的种子的特点是：个儿均匀、壳薄、仁多、味香、产量大。
    香榧是常绿乔木，叶子线形，种子卵形或椭圆形，外面有紫赤色假种皮。香榧树在四、五月开花，第二年十月种子成熟。榧子采回后，堆集起来，洒些水，使种皮腐烂，过几天再用清水洗净，晒干，用炭火焙制，半熟时洒点冷水，使衣脱离果实，然后加盐渍焙干，就成为香脆的椒盐香榧了。
    榧子一般含油量41.89％，蛋白质10％，脂肪4％，炭水化合物28％，灰分2.6％，其他13.51％。可以榨油，可以炒（焙）熟吃，也可作肠寄生虫驱除药。
    香榧分布范围不广，仅产浙江诸暨、绍兴、嵊县、东阳及安徽黟县。产得最多的要算诸暨，该县枫桥区的东溪乡培育经营香榧树已有一千多年的历史了。香榧有十年的丰产期，以后随着经营管理技术与气候条件的不同，收成有大小年的分别。普通一株香榧树，在结实年成可产榧子五十到七十斤，多的可到二百到三百斤。
