　　Take Good Care of the Selected Wheat Seeds
　　In order to prepare for a greater wheat harvest next year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are carrying out wheat appraisal and seed selection activities to select and retain enough wheat seeds for this year's winter sowing. How to properly store the selected seeds is just as important as selecting and retaining seeds.
　　Now is the hot summer season, with high temperatures and high humidity in the air. Especially in some parts of the south, there has been more rain this wheat season, and wheat seeds are most likely to absorb moisture, generate heat, or become infested with insects under these conditions. Some wheat varieties, due to their short dormancy period, are also prone to sprouting under these circumstances, losing their effectiveness as seeds. Selecting and retaining seeds is a very laborious task. Wouldn't it be a waste of all previous efforts if they were just left unattended after selection? If the seed quality is affected due to poor storage, the original meaning of selecting and retaining seeds is lost.
　　Chinese farmers have always paid attention to the storage and preservation of seeds, and have many methods. Although the storage of seeds in agricultural cooperatives has shifted from decentralized to centralized, and from small quantities to large quantities, some folk methods of storing seeds are still applicable. Summarizing these experiences and applying them to today's seed storage work is something that every agricultural cooperative should pay attention to.
　　Nowadays, agricultural cooperatives generally need to use tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of catties of seeds every year. How can so many seeds be properly stored? Smaller agricultural cooperatives mostly adopt the method of unified storage by the cooperative; larger agricultural cooperatives generally adopt the method of storage by teams; some also simultaneously adopt the method of distributing seeds that are more difficult to store to households for separate storage by members. From the experience of some units, the method of decentralized storage has its advantages. Its main advantages are: the number of seeds is small, inspection and sun-drying are easy, warehouses are also easy to find, and the division of labor is clear. There needs to be a dedicated person responsible for inspecting the seeds stored in a decentralized manner. In the past, some agricultural cooperatives did not establish necessary inspection systems, so there were still cases of reduced seed quality or damage to seeds in seed storage work. This needs to be taken into consideration.

### 把选留的麦种保管好

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

　　把选留的麦种保管好
    为了给明年小麦更大的丰收做好准备，各地农业社正在开展小麦的评比选种活动，选好留足今年冬播用的麦种。如何把选好的麦种保管好，也是和选种留种同样重要的工作。
    现在正是炎热的夏季，温度高，空气中的湿度也大，特别是南方的部分地区今年麦季雨水较多，小麦种子在这种情况下，最容易吸湿发热或生虫。有些小麦品种因为休眠期较短，遇到这种情况还容易出芽，丧失做种的效能。选留种子是一件很费力气的事情，如果选出来就不管了，岂不是前功尽弃了吗？如果由于保管不好，影响种子质量，就失掉了原来选留种子的意义。
    我国农民向来注意种子的贮藏保管，而且有很多办法。农业合作社的种子的保管虽然由分散转到集中，由小量变成大量，但是民间储存种子的一些办法还是适用的。总结这些经验，把它们运用到今天保管种子工作上，是每个农业社应当注意的事情。
    现在的农业社一般每年都需用几万到几十万斤种子，怎样才能保管好这样多的种子呢？比较小的农业社大都是采取由社统一保管的办法；比较大的农业社一般是采取分队保管的办法；有的还同时采用把比较不容易保管的种子分散到户，由社员分别保管。从一些单位的经验看，分散保管的办法是有优点的。它的优点主要是：种子数量较少，检查翻晒容易，仓房也容易找到，同时分工明确。对分散保管的种子需要有专人负责检查。过去有的农业社没有建立必要的检查制度，因此在保管种子工作里，仍有降低种子质量或损害种子的情况发生。这一点需要引起注意。
