    Inner Mongolia's Sörön Banner Cadre Style Significantly Transformed
    Deeply Involved with the Masses, Studying Animal Husbandry Production

    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Bai Shulian reports: After rectification and studying the experience of Hong'an County, the cadres of all ethnic groups in Sörön Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have seen significant changes in their ideology and work style, which has powerfully promoted the progress of various tasks. In the past, most of the cadres in this banner lacked a work style that emphasized going deep into reality and connecting with the masses. Their work in researching problems, discovering problems, and solving problems in a timely manner was very poor. Therefore, the herdsmen criticized them as "cadres who talk empty words," "cadres who talk about numbers," and only able to ask "Have you organized? Have you strengthened feeding management?" "How are you? How is your livestock?" without solving practical problems. On the basis of rectification and socialist education, the Sörön Banner Party Committee organized cadres at all levels to deeply study the experience of Hong'an County, examined and criticized the bad work style of being detached from reality and detached from the masses, and called on them to learn from the cadres of Hong'an County. At the same time, the Banner Party Committee first changed the method of leading animal husbandry production from the office and resolutely moved the office to the yurts. The main leading cadres of the Banner and Sumu (district) also established eleven experimental livestock groups, and according to the characteristics and laws of animal husbandry production, studied important issues such as disaster resistance and livestock protection, lambing and raising, mating and fattening, and hay storage on a seasonal and monthly basis, created experiences, and promoted them comprehensively. In order to stimulate the enthusiasm of cadres to learn and study animal husbandry production knowledge and technology, and to urge the backward to catch up with the advanced, the Banner and Sumu also frequently conducted visits and comparisons between Sumu and Sumu, Baga and Baga, and commune and commune, thereby powerfully promoting the current work. For example, in this spring's lambing work, the Banner Party Secretary Ala, based on the poor quality, insufficient quantity, and lack of sheds in livestock pens in various places, personally built several styles of lambing warm sheds in the Ulan Taoya Animal Husbandry Cooperative and promoted them throughout the Banner. Various places quickly built and completed the warm sheds, effectively resisting the largest blizzard since liberation and ensuring livestock safety. This year, except for a few individual herders and individual cooperatives, the survival rate of young livestock has reached 95% to 100%. The Imin Sumu of this Banner adopted the method of livestock group ranking, dividing livestock groups into three categories: advanced, intermediate, and backward, managing them separately, and assigning special personnel to strengthen the management of backward livestock groups, so that they can quickly catch up with the advanced. In addition, some cadres, while participating in and leading production, also study one or two fundamental issues related to animal husbandry production technology and management, gradually changing from laymen to experts. For example, Bao Rishao Bu, the Secretary of the Xini River West Sumu Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, who has been working in pastoral areas for more than two years but has never participated in animal husbandry production, has now learned the technique of assisting difficult births for ewes and the knowledge of lambing and raising through painstaking study. Bu Rente Gus, the organization member of the Xini River East Sumu Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to improve the survival rate of young livestock, studied the use of brick tea, wine, salt and other solutions to treat lamb arthritis, and cured fifteen lambs in two days. Si Leng Daxi, a cadre of the Banner Working Group, also developed a new method for treating umbilical cord disease in calves, and the herdsmen called him our "Taoketeg" (veterinarian).

### 内蒙古索伦旗干部作风显著转变  深入群众钻研牧业生产

    内蒙古索伦旗干部作风显著转变
    深入群众钻研牧业生产
    本报讯　记者白树廉报道：内蒙古自治区索伦旗各民族干部，经过整风和学习红安县的经验，思想作风有了显著转变，有力地推动了各项工作的进展。过去，这个旗的多数干部，缺乏深入实际、联系群众的作风，研究问题、发现问题和及时地解决问题，都作的很差。因此，牧民群众批评他们为“讲空话的干部”、“讲数字的干部”，只能够问问“组织起来没有？加强饲养管理了没有？”“你好？牲畜好？”不解决实际问题。中共索伦旗委在整风和社会主义教育的基础上，组织各级干部深入地学习了红安县的经验，检查和批判了脱离实际，脱离群众的坏作风，号召他们向红安县干部学习。同时，旗委首先改变了在办公室领导牧业生产的方法，坚决地把办公室搬到蒙古包里。旗和苏木（区）的主要领导干部还建立了十一个试验畜群，根据牧业生产的特点和规律，按季按月研究抗灾保畜、接羔保育、配种抓膘、打贮饲草等重要问题，创造经验，推广全面。为了激发干部学习、钻研牧业生产知识和技术的积极性，督促落后赶上先进，旗和苏木还经常在苏木与苏木、巴嘎与巴嘎、社与社之间进行参观评比，从而有力地推动了当前工作。如旗委书记阿拉他在今春接羔工作中，根据各地牲畜棚圈设备质量不好、数量不足、有圈没棚等情况，亲自在乌兰陶亚牧业社修了几种式样的接羔暖棚，并在全旗推广，各地很快地就把保暖棚圈修盖齐全，有效地抵御了解放以来最大一次暴风雪的袭击，保证了牲畜安全。今年除少数单干牧民及个别合作社外，仔畜成活率均达到了95％到100％。这个旗的伊敏苏木采取畜群排队的方法，把畜群分为先进、中等和落后三类，分别管理，对落后畜群则派专人加强管理，使之迅速赶上先进。此外，有些干部在参加和领导生产的同时，还研究一两项有关牧业生产技术和管理方面的根本问题，逐渐从外行变为内行。如参加牧区工作二年多但从未参加牧业生产的中共锡尼河西苏木工委书记宝日少布，经过苦心钻研，现在已经学会了为难产母畜助产的技术和接羔保育的知识。中共锡尼河东苏木工委组织委员布仁特古斯，为了提高仔畜成活率，研究用砖茶、酒、盐等溶液治疗羊羔关节炎，在两日内就治愈十五只羊羔。旗工作组干部斯冷达西还研究出治疗牛犊双脐带病的新办法，牧民群众称他为我们的“陶克得格”（兽医）。
