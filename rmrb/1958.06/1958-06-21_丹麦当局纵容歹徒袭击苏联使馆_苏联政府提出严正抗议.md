Xinhua News Agency, June 20th, Moscow Dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko summoned the Danish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Munk, in Moscow on the 19th, lodging a protest with the Danish government regarding the hostile actions taken by a group of thugs against the Soviet Embassy in Denmark on the 17th in Copenhagen, with the connivance of the Danish authorities.

The Soviet government's protest statement said that the Danish authorities could not have been unaware of the planning of the provocative activities against the Soviet Embassy, because some Danish newspapers had reported on the situation in advance, and the Soviet Embassy had even notified the Danish Foreign Ministry by telephone about the presence of a group of suspicious people in front of the embassy. The statement said that at the time of the provocation, the police present did not stop the thugs but actually connived at their lawless actions.

The statement said that the Soviet government firmly demanded that the Danish authorities take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, June 20th, Copenhagen Dispatch: On the evening of June 17th, a group of provocateurs and hooligans in Copenhagen, with the open connivance of the Danish police, carried out a hostile demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy in Denmark and launched a provocative attack on the embassy.

Before this incident, Copenhagen newspapers such as "Extra Bladet" and "Evening News," when publishing the news of the People's Republic of Hungary executing Nagy and his counter-revolutionary accomplices, reported on the planned hostile gathering to be held in front of the Soviet Embassy.

    丹麦当局纵容歹徒袭击苏联使馆
    苏联政府提出严正抗议
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯19日在莫斯科召见丹麦驻苏联大使穆克，就哥本哈根一群歹徒在丹麦当局纵容下17日对苏联驻丹麦大使馆采取敌视行动一事向丹麦政府提出抗议。
    苏联政府的抗议声明说，丹麦当局不可能不知道对苏联大使馆的挑衅活动的策划情况，因为一些丹麦报纸事先就报道了这种情况，而且苏联大使馆曾经用电话把大使馆前面出现了一群可疑的人这件事通知了丹麦外交部。声明说，在挑衅行动发生时，在场的警察没有阻止而是实际上纵容了歹徒们的无法无天的行动。
    声明说，苏联政府坚决要求丹麦当局采取有效措施，防止将来再发生类似事件。
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社哥本哈根18日讯：6月17日晚，哥本哈根的一群挑衅者和流氓在丹麦警察的公开纵容下在苏联驻丹麦大使馆前面进行了敌意的示威，并且对大使馆进行了挑衅性袭击。
    在这件事发生以前，哥本哈根“号外报”、“晚报”等报在发表匈牙利人民共和国处决纳吉及其反革命同谋者的消息时，就报道了正在筹划的将在苏联大使馆前举行敌对集会的消息。
