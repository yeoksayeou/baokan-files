Textile Workers Studying Culture
With the help of brotherly countries, the Nam Dinh Textile Factory in Vietnam, after two and a half years of restoration and development, is now equipped with 2,500 looms, of which 842 were supplied by China. This textile factory plans to increase the production of cotton cloth by 18.2% and cotton yarn by 3.3% this year compared to 1957. The factory pays great attention to helping workers improve their technical and cultural level. The picture shows the workers studying culture.
