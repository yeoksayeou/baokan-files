　　They Are Ordinary People
　　——Remembering the Creators of the "Single-Cylinder Two-Stroke Gas Water Pump"
　　By our Tianjin Correspondent
    In the Tianjin Machine Manufacturing School's auto garage, there stands a 丩-shaped iron pipe, connected to a small gas generator. This is the "single-cylinder two-stroke gas water pump" that has revolutionized the power structure of irrigation and drainage equipment. When Huang Zhengxia, director of the State Technology Commission, arrived at the garage for the appraisal, the workers connected gas to the cylinder, then used a bicycle pump to fill the cylinder with air. With a push of the choke, the gas immediately exploded with a "pi-pa" sound, and streams of clear water shot out from the vertical pipe. It oscillated 75 times per minute, continuously pumping water for over an hour. Director Huang excitedly shook hands with the principal and the workers, saying: "Congratulations on the success of this pump! It's probably the simplest and most economical internal combustion water pump currently available."

    Daring to Do What Predecessors Could Not
    This gas water pump was first tested by Peng Dingyi, an engineer at the school's practice factory. It was collectively researched and successfully trial-produced with the help of veteran worker Zhu Deheng, teacher Wu Zhensheng, and stoker Sun Liangyu after numerous modifications.

    After Chairman Mao's article on agricultural cooperation was published in 1955, Peng Dingyi was working at the Chongqing Machine Manufacturing School. After studying the article and witnessing the urgent need for irrigation and drainage machinery in the countryside while helping farmers combat drought, he thought: how beneficial it would be for agricultural development if there was a simple, easy-to-use, and inexpensive irrigation and drainage machine! After returning to school, he began experimenting with using air pumps to draw water and machine heads to drive "oil scoops." But none were successful. Then he thought: what if he broke away from the existing two major categories of thermal engines, turbine and piston types, and omitted the most complex mechanical transmission part of the irrigation and drainage equipment, using thermal power to directly act on the water pipe? Could water be pumped out? When he wrote to Zhang Deqing, director of the Automotive Tractor Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building and an expert in internal combustion engines, about this idea, he immediately received the expert's support. Zhang Deqing said in his reply: your idea is reasonable and potentially feasible. Predecessors have also conducted research in this area, but have not yet obtained results. Zhang Deqing also cut out materials from his reference books related to British scientist Humphrey's research on this issue from 1906 to 1909 and sent them to Peng Dingyi. Subsequently, the Thermophysics Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also sent him materials on American scientist Sterko's research on this issue in 1933 with similar concern. This was truly "like finding a treasure" for a teacher. However, after carefully analyzing the design materials of these two scientists, he found that although the simple water pumps they researched were a big step forward compared to ordinary internal combustion engines, their complexity was not less than that of a two-cylinder car engine. How to break out of this circle and trial-produce the simplest irrigation and drainage equipment consisting only of a water pipe and a coal stove became his unforgettable wish. With the support of the school, in 1956, he conducted an experiment using a single-cylinder two-stroke gas water pump powered by electricity to pump water. But after starting, the water pump only made a "puff" sound and then fell silent. He thought, since it could explode once, there must be a possibility of continuing to explode. But the technical problems could not be solved for the time being, and the research work was temporarily suspended.

    Perseverance and Determination
    Last year, Peng Dingyi was transferred from Chongqing to Tianjin Machine Manufacturing School. Soon after, he proposed researching the internal combustion water pump to Fang Zhen, director of the practice factory. Fang Zhen, a cadre who originally came from a worker background, thought Peng Dingyi's idea made sense after hearing his introduction and reported it to the principal, hoping to provide Peng with support. The principal immediately agreed. Although a secondary technical school does not have scientific research tasks, the principal believed that the successful research of this water pump would have great economic value, so he found a way to transport the experimental water pump that Peng Dingyi made in Chongqing to Tianjin and successively transferred comrades Zhu Deheng, Wu Zhensheng, and Sun Liangyu to work with Peng Dingyi on the research.

    Zhu Deheng is an auto repair worker with sixteen years of experience. He developed a fondness for the prototype water pump from Chongqing as soon as he saw it. After carefully studying it, he made many improvements to the water inlet valve, exhaust valve, and ignition device. By early March, the number of explosions of the water pump had increased from the original one to seven or eight. This boosted everyone's confidence even more. They studied, drew diagrams, manufactured parts, and experimented every day, working tirelessly, often until late at night. Sometimes, when the number of explosions increased by one or two, they were overjoyed. Sometimes, they researched for a long time without any gains, but they were not discouraged and continued to work hard. Due to their hard work, the number of explosions finally increased from seven or eight to dozens, and then hundreds. But the ignition device was still not sensitive, and the number of water sprays was also small, averaging only forty or so per minute.

    One day, the water pump powered by a motor in Red Star Agricultural Cooperative had a problem, and the school sent Zhu Deheng to help repair it. Zhu Deheng saw that the problem was very simple. This repair work made him think of the lack of technical strength in rural areas and the lack of charging equipment. The spark ignition used in the water pump they were researching was not suitable for rural areas. When he returned to school, he envisioned experimenting with methods such as burning fireballs and lighting paper twists for ignition, but the results of the experiments were not applicable. What to do? Later, he heard that farmers in Yangliuqing used the method of using small stoves to burn fire sticks for ignition, with good results. So he and Wu Zhensheng and Sun Liangyu went to Yangliuqing to visit and learn. After modification and installation, the choke was also adjusted. This fire stick ignition method was successfully tested on the internal combustion pump. In this way, the water pump continued to start with a "peng peng" sound, and the number of water sprays per minute increased from more than forty to seventy-five. It can spray about fifty tons of water per hour. If six tons of water (about nine millimeters) are poured per mu, it can irrigate more than eight mu in one hour. The simplest and most economical "single-cylinder two-stroke internal combustion water pump" was declared a success in irrigation and drainage equipment.

    They Are Ordinary People
    The four innovators who manufactured this water pump are not experts or scholars, but ordinary engineers, teachers, and veteran workers. Under the full support of the Party and administrative leaders, after recognizing the importance of their research work, they boldly experimented and painstakingly researched, never feeling the mystery of science and technology. Among the four innovators, Peng Dingyi, the only college graduate, originally studied mechanical processing and was a layman in internal combustion engines. However, inspired by the Outline for Agricultural Development, he dared to do what predecessors had not done and strived to climb the peak of science and technology. Zhu Deheng, who played a major role in the manufacturing of the water pump, only had a junior high school education, but based on his years of work experience, he did not bow his head when encountering difficulties. He studied each item, improved the structure of the water pump, and more than ten parts. Wu Zhensheng is a student who just graduated from a secondary vocational school. When he was transferring irrigation and drainage machinery for teaching purposes for the school, he learned that rural areas urgently needed water lifting tools for water conservancy construction. Stoker Sun Liangyu also worked in rural areas for several months during the large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and also participated in the fight against drought through irrigation. They knew that the successful research of the internal combustion water pump would bring great benefits to rural water conservancy. Therefore, they were very enthusiastic about participating in the trial production of the water pump, often working continuously for six or seven hours, and actively learning advanced experience and mastering technology.

　　他们是普通人
　　——记“单缸二冲程燃气水泵”的创造者
　　本报驻天津记者
    在天津机器制造学校汽车库里，矗立着一个丩形的铁管，旁边连结着一个小型的煤气发生炉。这就是革新了排灌设备动力结构的“单缸二冲程燃气水泵”。当前来鉴定的国家技术委员会黄正夏局长到了车库，工人们把煤气通入气缸，然后用自行车气筒往气缸中打足气，一按风门，煤气立即劈拍爆发，一股股的清水从水管的立管中喷射出来。它以每分钟七十五次的摆动，连续出水一个多小时。黄局长兴奋地握住校长和工人们的手说：“祝贺你们这台水泵成功了，这可能是目前最简单、最经济的内燃水泵”。
    敢于作前人作不到的事
    这台燃气水泵是由这个学校实习工厂的工程师彭定一首先试验，经过和老工人朱德恒、教员吴振声和司炉工人孙良玉等多次修改、集体研究试制成功的。
    1955年毛主席关于农业合作化问题的文章发表后，彭定一正在重庆机器制造学校工作。他学习了这篇文章，又在一次下乡帮助农民抗旱时，又看到了农村里迫切需要排灌机械的情况。他想，如果有一种简单易用而且造价不高的排灌机械，对于农业的发展该有多大好处！他回校后就开始用气筒打水和机器头带动“油提”的办法进行试验。但是都没有成功。这时他又想到：如果跳出了实际上现有的涡轮式、活塞式两大类热力发动机的圈子，省略掉排灌设备中最复杂的机械传动部分，由一种热力直接作用着水管，能不能排出水来呢？当他把这种想法写信向第一机械工业部汽车拖拉机研究所所长、内燃机专家张德庆请教的时候，立即得到这位专家的支持。张德庆在回信上对他说：你这种想法是合理的，也是可能实现的，前人也曾在这方面进行过研究，但还未获得结果。张德庆还把自己参考书上有关英国人洪孚理在1906年至1909年研究这个问题的资料剪下，寄给了彭定一。接着，中国科学院热力研究室也以同样关怀的心情，给他寄来了美国人斯特科在1933年研究这个问题的资料。这对一个教员来说真是“如获至宝”。但是，他详细分析了这两位科学家的设计资料以后，发现他们研究的简单水泵虽然比一般的内燃机前进了一大步，但是复杂的程度还不亚于一个双缸汽车的汽车头。如何跳出这个圈子，试制一种只有水管和煤炉的最简单的排灌设备，就成为他寝食难忘的愿望。在学校的支持下，他在1956年作了一个用电力发水的单缸二冲程燃气水泵进行试验。但是这个水泵发动以后，只嘭地一声，接着就不声不响了。他想，既然能爆发一次，一定有继续爆发的可能。但是技术上的问题一时不能解决，研究工作就暂时停顿下来。
    恒心和毅力
    去年彭定一由重庆调到天津机器制造学校工作。不久，他就向实习工厂主任方珍提出研究内燃水泵的问题。方珍原是工人出身的干部，听到彭定一介绍他的想法，认为有道理，就反映给校长，希望给彭以支持。校长立即就答应了。虽然一个中等技术学校没有科学研究任务，但是校长认为这个水泵研究成功有很大的经济价值，于是设法把彭定一在重庆做的那台试验水泵运到了天津，并且先后抽调朱德恒、吴振声、孙良玉等同志和彭定一一起进行研究。
    朱德恒是个有十六年工龄的汽车修理工人，一看见从重庆运来的水泵雏型就对它有了感情。经过他仔细研究，在进水阀、排气阀和点火装置方面做了许多改进。到3月初，水泵爆发的次数已由原来的一下提高到七、八下。这样大家的信心更足了。他们每天研究、画图，制造零件、试验，不停地工作着，常常搞到深夜。有时，爆发次数增加了一、两次，他们就欢喜得不得了。有时他们研究了很久没有收获，也毫不灰心，继续苦干。由于辛勤劳动，终于由七、八次增加到几十次，上百次。但是在点火装置上还不灵敏，喷水次数也少，平均每分钟只有四十多次。
    有一天，红星农业社用马达发动的水泵出了毛病，学校派朱德恒去帮助修理。朱德恒一看，毛病很简单。这次的修理工作使他联想到农村技术力量缺乏，没有充电设备，自己研究的水泵用电火花引火不适合农村。他回到学校就设想用烧火球、燃纸拈引火等方法试验，但是试验的结果，都不适用。怎么办呢？后来他听说杨柳青的农民使用小火炉烧火棍的办法引火，效果良好。于是他就和吴振声、孙良玉到杨柳青参观学习。经过修改安装，风门也作了调整，这种火棍引火的办法在内燃泵上试用成功了。这样水泵就不断地嘭嘭发动起来，每分钟喷水次数由四十多下提高到七十五下。每小时可喷水五十吨左右。如每亩地浇六吨水（约九公厘）一小时可浇八亩多地。在排灌设备中，一种最简单、经济的“单缸二冲程内燃水泵”就宣告成功了。
    他们是普通人
    制造这个水泵的四位革新者，都不是专家、学者，而是普通的工程师、教员和老工人。他们在党和行政领导的全力支持下，认清了自己研究工作的重要意义后，便大胆试验，苦心钻研，从不感到科学技术的神秘。四位革新者中，唯一的大学生彭定一原是学机械加工的，对内燃机是外行。但是，在农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，敢于做前人所没有做到的事，奋力攀登科学技术的高峰。在制造水泵过程中起了主要作用的朱德恒，只有初中文化程度，可是他凭着自己多年劳动的经验，碰到困难不低头，逐项研究，改进了水泵的结构和十多种零件。吴振声是刚由中等专业学校毕业的学生，他在为学校调运教学用的排灌机械的时候，了解到农村兴修水利迫切需要提水工具。司炉工人孙良玉在去冬大搞水利时，也曾在农村工作了几个月，还参加了排灌抗旱斗争。他们知道内燃水泵研究成功后会给农村水利事业带来很大的好处。因此，他们在参加水泵试制工作中劲头很足，经常连续工作六、七个小时，并且积极学习先进经验，掌握技术。
