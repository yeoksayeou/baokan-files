    Leave No Dead Angle
    Zhang Fan
    Recently, Chongqing conducted a major review of the rectification campaign and discovered some units where the rectification was incomplete or had been missed. The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee has determined that these units should undergo remedial lessons. This approach is highly commendable. In his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, Comrade Liu Shaoqi proposed that the rectification campaign must be thoroughly inspected and weak links vigorously strengthened in order to strive for a complete victory in the rectification campaign. The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee's approach is a very good measure to insist on carrying out the rectification to the end.
    The development of the rectification campaign, like all work, cannot be completely balanced. Nor can it be hoped that all problems will be solved in one movement. However, in every department or every place, the rectification campaign should be carried out to the end, striving for a complete victory in the rectification campaign. That is to say, all units should carefully check to see whether, after the rectification campaign, politics has taken command, whether interpersonal relationships have been reasonably adjusted, whether a lively political situation has emerged, whether superstitions have been broken, whether thinking has been liberated, and whether the drive to strive for the top has been boosted? We cannot neglect the problems that still exist in a few units because the rectification campaign in most units has achieved great success. In the overall leap forward of socialist construction, every unit should be adorned with a red flag. We certainly cannot allow the leadership of our socialist enterprises to be in the hands of right-wing elements or others who are half-hearted about socialism, nor can we allow those who promote retreat to lead our work with a spirit of being content with being downstream. If they are right-wing elements, we will replace them; if they are half-hearted, we will transform them; if they are promoters of retreat, we will promote them forward. In every department, proletarian ideology should be the soul, and it should be full of vigor and drive. If this goal is not achieved, the rectification campaign has not been properly carried out, and a review should be conducted and remedial lessons should be given, as decided by the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee.
    Admittedly, the rectification campaign has been going on for a long time, and some comrades are always afraid that it will take too long and affect work, but this is not the case. In those units where problems have not been solved deeply or thoroughly, or even have been missed, how can we talk about a leap forward in production or work if we do not seriously make up for this lesson? Only by carrying out the rectification seriously can we change their backward situation. Before the rural rectification campaign in Fujian Province, there were more than 800 backward branches and more than 3,400 backward cooperatives. After rectification, more than 80% of the backward cooperatives and backward branches got rid of their backward labels, and production and work advanced by leaps and bounds, with a brand-new look. Many cooperatives caught up with and surpassed the advanced cooperatives. Of course, the rectification of backward units should be strengthened, especially for some units that have not yet formed a strong and effective leadership core, the leading organs especially need to take some necessary measures; otherwise, the rectification will not easily achieve real results.

    不要留下一个死角
    张帆
    重庆市最近对整风运动进行了一次大检查，发现了一些整风不彻底和漏掉的单位。重庆市委确定这些单位要进行补课。这种作法很值得提倡。刘少奇同志向八大二次会议所作的报告中提出对整风运动必须深入检查，大力加强薄弱的环节，以争取整风运动的全胜。重庆市委的作法正是坚持把整风进行到底的一个很好的措施。
    整风运动的发展也像所有的工作一样，不可能完全平衡。也不能希望在一次运动中使所有的问题都得到解决。但是，不论在哪一个部门或哪一个地方，却都应该把整风运动进行到底，争取整风运动的全胜。也就是说，在所有的单位都应该认真地检查一下，看看经过整风运动，政治是否已经挂了帅、人与人之间的相互关系是否已经有了合理的调整、生动活泼的政治局面是否已经出现、迷信是否已经破除、思想是否已经得到解放、力争上游的干劲是否已经鼓足？我们不能因为大多数的单位的整风运动已经取得巨大的成就而忽视了少数单位还存在的问题。在社会主义建设的全面大跃进中，任何一个单位都应当插上红旗。我们当然不能允许我们的社会主义事业单位的领导权掌握在右派分子或其他对社会主义三心二意的人的手里，同样不允许促退派用甘居下游的精神来领导我们的工作。是右派分子，我们就要撤换他；是三心二意的，我们要改造他；是促退派，我们就要促进他。在任何部门都应该是无产阶级思想作灵魂，都应该是充满了朝气勃勃的干劲。达不到这个目的，整风运动就没有整好，就应该像重庆市委决定的那样，进行一次检查，重新补上课。
    诚然，整风运动已经进行了很长时间，有些同志总怕时间拖得太久了，会影响工作，其实不然。在那些问题解决得不深不透甚至漏掉了的单位中，如果不认真补上这一课，又怎样能够谈得上生产或工作的跃进呢？只有认真进行整风才能改变他们的落后面貌。福建省农村整风前原有八百多落后支部，三千四百多落后社，经过整风整社，有80％以上的落后社和落后支部摘掉了落后帽子，生产和工作突飞猛进，面貌一新，很多社赶上并且超过了先进社。当然，对落后单位的整风应该加强领导，特别是对有些还不能形成坚强有力的领导核心的单位，领导机关尤其需要采取一些必要的措施，否则，整风就不容易真正收效。
