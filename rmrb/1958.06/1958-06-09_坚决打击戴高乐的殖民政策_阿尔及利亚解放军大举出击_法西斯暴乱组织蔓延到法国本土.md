Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Algiers: The Algerian National Liberation Army is responding to De Gaulle's recent deceptive propaganda of colonial policy in Algeria with widespread offensives.

Less than thirty-six hours after De Gaulle's visit to the eastern Algerian coastal city of Bone, a unit of the Algerian National Liberation Army stormed into the city on the 7th, attacking a police station and wounding three police officers. On the same day, Algerian patriots killed three traitors, including one member of the local riot organization "Committee of Public Safety," in Sidi Bel Abbès, the location of the Foreign Legion.

It is reported that although no incidents occurred in Algiers itself in recent days, the National Liberation Army has launched widespread offensives in many other regions of Algeria, and carried out sabotage activities along railway lines.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th dispatch: A spokesman for the Algerian National Liberation Front said here on the 7th that the army of the Algerian National Liberation Front will inflict new blows on the French colonial army in the coming days. They will "strike with maximum force" against the French colonial army.

The leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front are currently holding a meeting here to study the recent situation in Algeria.

When asked about the current situation in Algeria, the spokesman said: "The struggle continues as before."

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Paris: After De Gaulle returned to Paris from Algeria on the evening of the 6th, he convened a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 7th to report on the results of his trip to Algeria. The meeting approved some measures announced by De Gaulle in Algeria.

According to Parisian political figures, the cabinet meeting discussed the activities of the "Committee of Public Safety," the Algerian riot group. De Gaulle praised this organization during his visit to Algeria and stated that he would continue to use it, but this visit also exposed the contradictions between De Gaulle and this organization. The government did not comment on this issue after the cabinet meeting.

Now the rioters of the Algerian "Committee of Public Safety" are stepping up their activities in an attempt to expand this fascist riot organization to all parts of mainland France. According to an announcement by a fascist organization in Paris on the 7th, so-called "Committees of Public Safety" have now been established in Paris and fourteen provinces of France.

"L'Humanité" pointed out on the 7th that the "Committees of Public Safety" intend to "organize a fascist network throughout France." The Socialist Party newspaper "Le Populaire" wrote that the leaders of the "Committees of Public Safety" may attempt to establish organizations in France similar to Hitler's SS.

After the cabinet meeting, Minister of Propaganda Malraux told reporters that the government has confirmed that the Algerian Delegations-General will henceforth be under the direct jurisdiction of the head of government. He announced that General Salan, one of the Algerian riot leaders, has been approved as the chief representative of the French government in Algeria, wielding all administrative and military power in Algeria, and reporting directly to De Gaulle.

Malraux said that the referendum on the amendment to the French Constitution is expected to be held on October 5th this year, two days before the scheduled resumption of the National Assembly. He said that if the referendum passes the proposed amendment to the Constitution, then new parliamentary elections will "definitely" be held. Malraux also announced that municipal council "elections" will be held in Algeria in about a month.

    坚决打击戴高乐的殖民政策
    阿尔及利亚解放军大举出击
    法西斯暴乱组织蔓延到法国本土
    新华社8日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军以广泛的出击来回答戴高乐最近在阿尔及利亚所进行的带欺骗性的殖民政策的宣传。
    在戴高乐访问阿尔及利亚东海岸波尼城以后不到三十六个小时，一支阿尔及利亚民族解放军7日突入这个城市，并且袭击了一个警察所，打伤了三名警察。同一天，阿尔及利亚爱国者在西迪培尔阿卑斯的外籍军团所在地打死了三个卖国者，其中一个是当地暴乱组织“救国委员会”的人。
    据报道，连日来，虽然在阿尔及尔一地没有发生什么事件，但是在阿尔及利亚的其他许多地区，民族解放军进行了广泛的出击，并且在铁路沿线进行了破坏活动。
    新华社开罗8日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线发言人7日在这里说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的军队将在以后几天中给法国殖民军以新的打击。他们将“用最大的力量来打击”法国殖民军。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖们目前正在这里举行会议，研究阿尔及利亚最近的局势。
    有人问起目前阿尔及利亚局势，这位发言人说：“斗争仍然像以前那样在继续进行。”
    据新华社8日讯　巴黎消息：戴高乐6日晚从阿尔及利亚回到巴黎以后，在7日上午召开了内阁会议，报告这次阿尔及利亚之行的结果。会议批准了戴高乐在阿尔及利亚宣布的一些措施。
    据巴黎政界人士指出，内阁会议讨论了阿尔及利亚暴乱集团的“救国委员会”的活动。戴高乐在阿尔及利亚访问时赞扬了并且表示将继续利用这个组织，同时这次访问也暴露出戴高乐和这个组织之间的矛盾。政府在内阁会议后没有就这个问题表示意见。
    现在阿尔及利亚“救国委员会”的暴乱分子正在加紧活动，企图把这个法西斯暴乱组织扩大到法国本土各地。据巴黎的一个法西斯组织7日宣布，现在在巴黎和法国的十四个省已经建立了所谓“救国委员会”。
    “人道报”7日指出，“救国委员会”打算“在整个法国范围内组织法西斯网”。社会党报纸巴黎“人民报”写道，“救国委员会”的领袖们可能企图在法国建立希特勒党卫军式的各种组织。
    宣传部长马尔罗在内阁会议以后对记者说，政府已经确认，阿尔及利亚驻节部今后将由政府首脑直接管辖。他宣布已经批准阿尔及利亚暴乱头子之一萨兰将军为法国政府驻阿尔及利亚的首席代表，他掌握阿尔及利亚一切行政和军事大权，并且直接受戴高乐领导。
    马尔罗说，关于修改法国宪法的公民投票预料将在今年10月5日举行，即在国民议会预定复会的前两天举行。他说，如果公民投票通过了修改宪法的建议，那么就“一定”要进行新的议会选举。马尔罗还宣布，大约一个月以后就要在阿尔及利亚举行市议会“选举”。
