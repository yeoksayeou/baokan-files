    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 31st: Faced with the threat of De Gaulle seizing power through so-called "legal" means, the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement on the 30th calling on French workers to widely strike and stop work to oppose De Gaulle taking power. The statement said, "Now, more than ever, it is necessary to demonstrate the powerful opposition of workers and those who support the republican system. We want a republican government, not a De Gaulle dictatorship."

    Workers in many parts of France, especially those in the mechanical industry, responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labor and held strikes on the 30th. Metallurgical workers in Paris and many other places who went on strike on the 29th continued their strike on the 30th. All enterprises, shipyards, and dock workers in La Rochelle went on strike. In Bordeaux, almost all factories shut down. In Seine-et-Marne, almost all factories held anti-fascist strikes. Workers in Le Havre, Dieppe, Rouen, Douai, Grenoble, and other places also went on strike on the same day.

    In the mining city of Reims, thousands of people led by leaders of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party held demonstrations. In Le Mans, representatives from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, local organizations belonging to the French General Confederation of Labor and the "Workers' Force" trade union, and more than 12,000 people participated in a march through the entire city.

    Yesterday afternoon, several thousand university students and professors held an anti-fascist demonstration rally in the central square of the University of Paris, braving torrential rain. Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned the conspiracy to let De Gaulle take power, shouted slogans to overthrow De Gaulle, and sang the Marseillaise. When 240,000 primary and secondary school teachers in France held an anti-fascist strike yesterday, the vast majority of students' parents told their children not to go to school to express their protest against the fascist conspiracy.

    At the same time, laborers and republicans resolutely fought back against fascist provocations. On the evening of the 30th, when thousands of laborers and anti-fascists marched in dense formations from nearby streets to the Champs-Élysées, a group of fascists holding reactionary demonstrations on this street provoked the pro-republican demonstration, shouting anti-republican slogans and smashing car windows on the street. Clashes occurred between the two sides and continued late into the night. Similar clashes also occurred in Bordeaux today.

    坚决反对戴高乐上台
    法国人民斗争浪潮高涨
    据新华社巴黎31日电　面对戴高乐通过所谓“合法”途径夺取政权的威胁，法国总工会在30日发表声明号召法国工人广泛的举行罢工、停工反对戴高乐上台。声明说，“现在比任何时候更需要表现出工人和拥护共和制度的人的有力的反对。我们要共和政府，不要戴高乐独裁。”
    法国许多地方的工人特别是机械工业的工人响应总工会的号召在30日举行了罢工。在29日举行罢工的巴黎及许多地方的冶金工人也在30日继续举行罢工。拉罗歇尔的所有企业、造船厂和码头的工人都举行了罢工。在波尔多，几乎所有工厂都停工。在塞纳马恩省，几乎所有工厂都举行了反法西斯的罢工。在同一天举行罢工的还有哈佛尔、第厄普、卢昂、杜埃、格累诺布尔等地的工人。
    在矿业城市兰斯，由共产党和社会党领袖带头的几千人举行了示威游行。在勒蒙，共产党、社会党、激进社会党、属于法国总工会和“工人力量”总工会的地方组织的代表们和一万二千多人一齐参加了穿过全城的游行。
    昨天下午几千名大学生和教授在巴黎大学中心广场冒着倾盆大雨举行了反对法西斯的示威集会，在会上发言的人一致谴责让戴高乐上台的阴谋，会上高呼打倒戴高乐的口号并且高唱马赛曲。当昨天法国二十四万中小学教师举行反法西斯的罢教时，绝大部分学生的家长都叫他们的子女不去上学以表示对法西斯阴谋的抗议。
    同时，劳动者和共和人士对法西斯的挑衅进行了坚决的反击，30日晚间当几千个劳动者和反法西斯人士以密集的队形从附近街道走到爱丽舍大街时，在这条街上举行反动示威的一群法西斯分子向拥护共和制的游行队伍挑衅，他们高呼反共和制的口号，打碎了街道上汽车玻璃。双方发生了冲突并且继续到深夜。今天在波尔多也发生了类似的冲突。
