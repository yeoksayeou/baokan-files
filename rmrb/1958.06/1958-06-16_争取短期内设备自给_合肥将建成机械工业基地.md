To build Hefei into the province's industrial base centered on the machinery industry is a major measure recently adopted by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to realize the province's technological revolution.

In the factory area of the mechanical industry center in the suburbs of Hefei, thousands of construction workers and technicians are working day and night. Equipment manufactured by many cooperative areas for this mechanical industry center has been partially transported to Hefei. Feidong and Feixi, two neighboring counties, have voluntarily sent 20,000 laborers, led by their deputy county heads, to support the construction of the factory area.

This mechanical industrial center includes more than 20 projects, which will be basically completed in 1961. These projects include a hydraulic turbine factory with an annual output of 500,000 kilowatts of hydraulic turbines, a mining machinery factory with an annual output of 40,000 tons of various mining transportation equipment, a machine tool factory with an annual output of 6,000 machine tools of various types, a textile machinery manufacturing factory with an annual output of 100,000 spindles, and relatively large general machinery factories, forging and casting factories, automobile factories, tractor factories, and motor factories. When the hydraulic turbine factory and motor factory are completed, they can basically solve the equipment needed for small and medium-sized hydropower stations in the province. The tractor factory and automobile factory can produce tens of thousands of tractors and light vehicles annually, and the general machinery factory can manufacture the main equipment needed by fertilizer plants.

In order to speed up the construction, many factories in the plan are being built on the basis of the equipment of old factories, adopting the method of simultaneous construction and production. For example, the machine tool factory uses the equipment of the original Hefei Machine Tool Factory and can produce 1,300 machine tools this year to supply various parts of the province. The mining machinery factory, tractor factory, and automobile factory are all expanding by means of simultaneous production and construction. The automobile factory and tractor factory will produce 50 to 100 tractors and automobiles this year and have already produced three tractors. In terms of staffing, training is mainly carried out from the original factories. Several small and medium-sized factories in this mechanical industrial center are being built and expanded very quickly, and some have already been put into production.

In order to supply raw materials in time and ensure the rapid progress of the infrastructure construction of the mechanical industrial center, the newly built refractory material factory, high-grade cement factory, small steel-making furnace, more than 20 small iron-smelting furnaces, and indigenous coking plants in Hefei are all speeding up construction, striving to put them all into production in July.

### 争取短期内设备自给  合肥将建成机械工业基地

    争取短期内设备自给
    合肥将建成机械工业基地
    本报合肥15日电　把合肥建设成全省的以机械工业为中心的工业基地，这是中共安徽省委最近为实现全省技术革命采取的一个重大措施。
    合肥城郊，机械工业中心的工厂区，成千上万的基建工人和技术人员，日夜不停地进行施工，许多协作区为这个机械工业中心制造的设备，部分已运到合肥。肥东、肥西两个邻县主动派出了两万民工，由副县长亲自率领前来支援工厂区的建设工作。
    这个机械工业中心包括二十多个项目，1961年基本建成。这些项目中有能年产五十万瓩水轮机的水轮机厂，年产四万吨重各种矿山运输设备的矿山机器厂，年产各种机床六千台的机床厂，年产十万纱锭的纺织机制造厂，有较大型的通用机械厂、锻铸厂、汽车厂、拖拉机厂、电机厂等。其中水轮机厂和电机厂建成后就可基本解决全省中、小型水电站所需要的设备，拖拉机厂和汽车厂每年可生产上万辆的拖拉机和轻型汽车，通用机械厂能制造化肥厂所需要的主要设备。
    为了加快建设速度，规划中的许多厂，都以老厂的设备为基础，采取边建、边产的办法进行兴建。如机床厂利用原合肥机床厂的设备，在今年内就可生产一千三百台机床，供应省内各地。矿山机械厂、拖拉机厂、汽车厂都是以边生产、边建厂的办法进行扩建，汽车厂及拖拉机厂今年将要生产五十到一百台拖拉机和汽车，现已制成三台拖拉机。在人员配备方面，也主要从原有工厂进行培训。这个机械工业中心的几个中、小型厂，建厂和扩建速度都很快，有的已经投入生产。
    为了及时供应原材料，保证机械工业中心的基建工程迅速进行，合肥新建的耐火材料厂、高标号水泥厂、小型炼钢炉、二十多个小型炼铁炉、土焦厂等都在加快施工，争取7月份全部投入生产。
