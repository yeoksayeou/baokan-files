Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 6th: How to make market management work well for the general line of socialist construction? The Market and Price Committee of Hebei Province held on-site meetings in Tianjin and Wuqing County from May 28th to June 3rd to exchange experiences in market management.

After the high tide of socialist transformation, socialist forces occupied an absolute advantage in the markets of Tianjin and Wuqing County. However, capitalist spontaneous forces still played a considerable destructive role. During the rectification movement, these two places resolutely fought against the capitalist spontaneous forces in the market. On the one hand, they publicized the state's policies to vendors, conducted patriotic and law-abiding education, and organized vendors to carry out debates on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. On the other hand, they launched a major market inspection with "cleaning up unlicensed vendors and cracking down on speculative activities" as the main content, and publicized it to the masses. After face-to-face reasoning and debate with members of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Wuqing County and speculative elements who abandoned agriculture for business, they clarified the boundary between the two roads and consciously assisted the state in managing the market.

Through struggle, vendors generally were willing to take the socialist road. According to the spirit of the general line of socialist construction, the industrial and commercial administrative departments in the two places arranged and dealt with them according to their respective situations. The Hexi District of Tianjin has further transformed all 824 mobile vendors engaged in the operation of non-staple food in the district from the original decentralized operation of cooperative groups with self-financing and self-responsibility for profits and losses into 30 cooperative stores under the direct leadership of state-owned stores, with "unified accounting, sharing profits and losses." The members of the cooperative stores have become sales agents of state-owned stores. The cooperative groups and a small number of individual vendors in various market towns in Wuqing County have generally established joint offices, elected directors and members themselves, and assisted the government in educating, supervising, and managing vendors. The two places also organized some people to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. All unlicensed vendors and some licensed vendors in Wuqing County participated in agricultural production cooperatives, and invested some funds in the agricultural cooperatives according to the principle of voluntariness. Appropriate measures were taken against vendors engaged in serious speculation and illegal activities.

The market appearance of Tianjin and Wuqing County has now been completely renewed. Nearly 80% of the vendors in the city have participated in cooperative stores and cooperative groups, and have formulated patriotic and law-abiding covenants and leap forward plans for accepting socialist transformation. There is no longer any illegal operation of state monopoly purchase and marketing materials by vendors in the rural primary markets of Wuqing County.

Ma Li, Vice Governor of Hebei Province, pointed out at the on-site meeting that the experiences of Tianjin and Wuqing County are two red flags for market management in cities and rural areas throughout the province. He requested the province to gradually establish a completely stable socialist market by the end of June.

    同资本主义自发势力作斗争
    建立完全稳定的社会主义市场
    河北举行现场会议推广天津、武清的经验
    据新华社天津6日电　如何使市场管理工作很好地为社会主义建设总路线服务，河北省市场物价委员会5月28日到6月3日分别在天津市和武清县举行了现场会议，交流市场管理工作的经验。
    天津市和武清县在社会主义改造高潮以后，市场上社会主义的力量占了绝对优势。但是资本主义自发势力，仍然起着相当的破坏作用。在整风运动中，这两地，坚决与市场上的资本主义自发势力作斗争。他们一方面向商贩宣传国家的政策，进行爱国守法教育，组织商贩开展关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的辩论；另一方面，开展以“清理无照商贩、取缔投机活动”为主要内容的市场大检查，并且向群众宣传。武清县光明农业社社员和社内弃农经商的投机分子进行面对面的说理辩论以后，分清了两条道路的界限，自觉地协助国家管理市场。
    经过斗争，商贩们普遍愿意走社会主义道路。两地工商行政管理部门根据社会主义建设总路线的精神，分别情况对他们进行安排处理。天津市河西区已经把全区八百二十四个经营副食品的流动商贩，从原来分散经营自负盈亏的合作小组，进一步改造成为三十个在国营商店直接领导下的“统一核算、共负盈亏”的合作商店。合作商店的成员都成为国营商店的代销员。武清县各集镇的合作小组和少数单干商贩普遍成立了联合办公室，自己推选主任和委员，协助政府教育、监督和管理商贩。两地还组织一部分人下乡参加农业生产。武清县的全体无照商贩和部分有正照的商贩参加了农业生产合作社，资金按自愿原则向农业社投一部分。对严重投机违法商贩，都给以适当的处理。
    天津市和武清县现在市场面貌已经一新。全市有近80％的商贩参加了合作商店和合作小组，制定了爱国守法公约和接受社会主义改造的跃进计划。武清县农村初级市场上的商贩已经没有违法经营国家统购统销物资的现象。
    河北省副省长马力在现场会上指出，天津市和武清县的经验是全省城市和农村市场管理的两面红旗。他要求全省在6月底逐步建立起一个完全稳定的社会主义市场。
