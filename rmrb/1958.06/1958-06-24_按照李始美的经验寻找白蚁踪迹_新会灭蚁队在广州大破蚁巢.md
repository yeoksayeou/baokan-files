Following Li Shimei's Experience to Find Termite Traces
Xinhui Termite Extermination Team Destroys Termite Nests in Guangzhou

(Our newspaper's dispatch) Li Shimei's apprentices, the Xinhui County Termite Extermination Team, publicly destroyed termite nests at the Liurong Temple in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 20th.

Liurong Street was considered a street where termites had been basically eliminated. The Liurong Temple had spent 115.20 yuan to have the Guangzhou Municipal Joint Public-Private Termite Prevention and Control Company inspect and treat the area with medicine, with the company guaranteeing treatment for one year; however, they did not find the main termite nest and believed that the termites had been eliminated.

On the 20th, Liu Zhongming, a 21-year-old member of the Xinhui Termite Extermination Team, and He Youhua, an 18-year-old member, found a main termite nest and a secondary nest in the temple, respectively.

Based on Li Shimei's experience that "where there are termites, there must be a nest, and where there is a secondary nest, there must be a main nest," they immediately determined that there were still termite nests here. Liu Zhongming discovered a large dead tree stump in front of the Lao Guanyin Hall, with termite excrement and old termite paths on it. According to Li Shimei's experience, a large tree stump is highly likely to become a termite nest. Liu Zhongming used an iron tool to insert it into the stump and then pulled it out to smell it. On the third insertion, he smelled the odor of termites. Digging open the tree stump, it was indeed a large termite nest. Many soldier termites were active. According to Li Shimei's experience, this was the main nest. A private sector employee of a termite prevention and control company who was present at the time explained that they were only responsible for treating termites indoors and were not responsible for termites outdoors. But then He Youhua, 18, discovered small plum blossom-like holes at the bottom of a wooden beam in a room about ten feet away from the main nest. He immediately judged that these small holes were for termites to breathe air, and there must be a hidden nest here. Looking further, there was a water-absorbing line on the door frame leading to the ground. According to Li Shimei's experience, this further confirmed the presence of a termite nest. So, he climbed up a ladder, knocked on the beam, and heard a hollow sound. He inserted an iron tool, and soldier termites came out. A termite secondary nest was defeated.

On the morning of the 21st, Li Shimei's apprentices dissected the termite nests. Liang Shefa, the captain of the Termite Extermination Team, and the team members peeled the termite nest layer by layer and found the royal chamber. The royal chamber was particularly large, as tall as a finger and as wide as half a palm, where the "fat queen termite" lived. These facts proved that the team members' judgment about the main nest was correct.

### 按照李始美的经验寻找白蚁踪迹  新会灭蚁队在广州大破蚁巢

    按照李始美的经验寻找白蚁踪迹
    新会灭蚁队在广州大破蚁巢
    本报讯  李始美的徒弟们——新会县消灭白蚁队20日下午在广州六榕寺当众大破蚁巢。
    六榕街是被认为基本消灭白蚁的街。六榕寺曾经花了一百一十五元二角请广州市公私合营白蚁防治公司检查过和用过药，由公司包治一年；但是他们没有找到白蚁主巢，便认为白蚁已经消灭了。
    20日，新会消灭白蚁队二十一岁的队员刘仲明和十八岁的队员何佑华却在这个寺里分别找到一个白蚁主巢和一个副巢。
    他们根据李始美有蚁必有巢、有副巢必有主巢的经验，一开始就认定这里还有蚁巢。刘仲明在老观音殿门口发现一个大枯树头，上面有白蚁的排泄物和旧蚁路。根据李始美的经验，大树头成为白蚁巢的可能性很大，刘仲明就用铁器插下去，又抽出来嗅嗅，插到第三次，就嗅出白蚁的气味了，挖开树头，果然是一个大蚁巢。兵蚁出动很多，按照李始美的经验，这是主巢。当时在场的一个防治白蚁公司的私方人员解释说，他们只负责治屋内的白蚁，对屋外的白蚁他们是不管的。但接着十八岁的何佑华在离主巢约一丈远的一间房子内，发现木梁的底部有梅花点样的小孔。他马上判断这些小孔是白蚁呼吸空气用的，这里一定有暗巢。再看门框上有一条吸水线通到地下。按照李始美的经验，更加肯定有蚁巢。于是他用梯子爬上去，敲一敲梁木，听到有空洞的声音。再用铁器插下去，兵蚁就出来了。一个白蚁副巢又攻陷了。
    21日上午，李始美的徒弟们解剖了白蚁巢。消灭白蚁队队长梁社发和队员们把蚁巢一层层剥开，就找到了白宫和皇室。皇室特别大，有手指那样高，半个手掌那样阔，是“肥蚁后”住的地方。这些事实证明队员们关于主巢的判断是正确的。
