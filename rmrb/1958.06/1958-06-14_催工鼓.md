    Labor-Urging Drum
    During the busy farming season, as long as you step into the territory of Lufang Township in Xiushui County, Jiangxi, you can hear the "dong, dong" drum sounds in the mountains and fields. This is the local people's commonly used form of production propaganda and mobilization – the folk art of the Labor-Urging Drum.
    The Labor-Urging Drum is used when the masses are engaged in collective labor production. The drummer carries the drum on their back, specializing in urging work, drumming and singing labor chants. The drummer leads the singing and everyone echoes. The drum is played wherever production goes. If someone is not energetic in production, the drum will be敲到敲到 [transliteration note: this probably means beated closer to] their face to boost their morale.
    The lyrics and drumbeats of the Labor-Urging Drum are different in the morning, noon, afternoon, and during breaks. For example, when digging the ground in the morning, they sing: "The sun rises in the east, the sun rises in the east, the hoe must be used with deep effort. If the seedlings were grown well last year, a good harvest is guaranteed next year, hang up the lanterns and the hall is full of red." The drummer not only urges work but also acts as a commander. When the drum is sounded, it is like the charge has been blown, and everyone listens to the drummer's command. (Fu Zhiyin)

    催工鼓
    在农忙的季节里，只要你走进江西修水县卢坊乡的地界，不论在山上、田野，都可以听到“咚咚”的鼓声，这就是该地群众惯用的生产宣传鼓动形式——民间艺术催工鼓。
    催工鼓是当群众集体劳动生产时，打鼓手背着鼓，专事催工，边打边唱劳动号子，鼓手领唱大家相和，生产到哪里，鼓就打到哪里，如果谁生产不起劲，鼓就会敲到谁的面前来鼓鼓气。
    催工鼓的唱词、鼓板，早上、中午、下午、歇伙都不同，如早上挖地，就唱：“日头东，日头东，锄头就要工夫深，上年苗稼作得好，下年保险好收成，挂起灯笼满堂红。”鼓手不仅催工，而且起指挥员的作用，敲起了鼓，就等于吹响了冲锋号，人人都听鼓手的指挥。（傅之因）
