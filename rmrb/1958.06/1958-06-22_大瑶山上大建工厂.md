    Building Factories on a Large Scale in the Dayao Mountains
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Dayao Mountain Yao Autonomous County in Guangxi is building thirty-one small factories this year.

    Apart from four tea processing factories, the majority of these small factories use wild plants as raw materials. This year they are expected to produce 14,000 jin of high-grade essential oils and 128,000 jin of wild plant oils. It is planned to use the sweet potato residue and wild fruits left over from starch production to brew wine. By the fourth quarter, production is expected to exceed 110,000 jin of wine. In addition to fully meeting the needs of the county's market, a portion can also be transferred to other areas.

    大瑶山上大建工厂
    本报讯  广西大瑶山瑶族自治县今年兴建三十一个小型工厂。
    这批小型厂除四个茶叶加工厂外，大都是利用野生植物作原料，今年就可出产高级芳香油一万四千市斤，野生植物油十二万八千市斤。计划利用制淀粉剩下的薯渣和野果来酿酒，到第四季就可产酒十一万多斤，除足供本县市场需要外，还可外调一部分。
