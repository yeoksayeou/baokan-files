Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 22nd. The 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC) on June 21st adopted a resolution on the work report of the CPC Central Committee delivered by Comrade Novotny. The resolution believes that the achievements made by Czechoslovakia in construction prove that the general line for building socialism in Czechoslovakia, as stipulated by the previous party congresses, is completely correct.

    Regarding Czechoslovakia's foreign policy, the resolution expressed its firm belief that the powerful strength of the socialist camp and the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world will shatter the war conspiracies of imperialism. The resolution stated that Czechoslovakia actively supports the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and the various proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions.

    The resolution stated that the firm unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties reflected in the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties in November of last year, and the documents adopted at the meeting, are the fundamental conditions for all victories in the struggle for socialism.

    We believe that the struggle against revisionism is our international obligation. Revisionism attacks the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and attempts to undermine the unity of the communist revolutionary movement. We firmly oppose the anti-Marxist revisionist views promoted by the representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which are fully reflected in the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In this revisionist program, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has isolated itself from the international communist movement.

    The resolution stated that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has made sufficient efforts to strive for reconciliation with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. We, like other fraternal parties, believe that the future development of relations between our two parties will depend on the further actions of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. As far as national policies are concerned, we will continue to maintain mutually beneficial relations with Yugoslavia.

    The resolution stated that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia will do everything possible to strive for the broadest international unity of the working class in all countries. It will strive to develop closer relations with social democratic parties in capitalist countries, with their representatives, and with other workers' organizations and trade union organizations.

    In our relations with the countries of the socialist camp, we will more unswervingly follow the principle of friendly mutual assistance, which is the highest manifestation of proletarian internationalism. We will continue to strengthen the defense capabilities and vigilance of Czechoslovakia and the entire collective of the Warsaw Treaty signatories, because the imperialists are still carrying out conspiracies against socialist countries. We will actively contribute to the international socialist division of labor within the framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and actively contribute to the common and fullest use of all the strengths and resources of socialism for the benefit of the entire socialist camp.

    Regarding the issue of domestic socialist construction, the resolution stated that the CPC's main tasks in the future are: to ensure that socialist, cooperative large-scale production dominates in agriculture, to eliminate the remnants of hostile classes, and to further develop productive forces on the basis of the latest technologies, especially automation, mechanization, and chemicalization. At the same time, socialist democracy must be continuously strengthened and perfected, so that the working people can more actively participate in the management of the state and the economy, and continue to strengthen the people's spiritual and political unity and complete the cultural revolution in accordance with the spirit of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

    The resolution calls for a further rapid and comprehensive improvement in the people's living standards, especially through lowering the prices of basic commodities and increasing real incomes. While comprehensively increasing personal consumption, the personal consumption of low-income families, especially families with many children, should be increased more rapidly.

    The resolution stated that the tasks facing agricultural production are: to utilize all potential in order to reach the level of the most developed capitalist countries in terms of unit area yield and agricultural labor productivity in a short period of time. In order to achieve this, the resolution calls for providing agriculture with 100,000 new tractors and a large number of machines to mechanize livestock production by 1965, and requires that the output of chemical fertilizers be increased to two and a half times that of 1957. The resolution also calls for attention to strengthening and developing agricultural cooperatives and fundamentally improving the work of state farms.

    The resolution emphasizes the need to develop the economic organization and cultural and educational role of the Czechoslovak socialist state. The resolution stated that the congress fully agrees with the measures taken by the national economy and the People's Committees to enable the working people to participate more in deciding all issues of economic and public life. In order to ensure that the republic has the strongest defense capability and to eliminate any attempts to hinder the people's construction, the resolution believes that it is necessary to further strengthen the army, security organs, procuratorial and judicial organs.

    The resolution stated that Czechoslovakia has achieved many accomplishments in the cultural revolution, and the feelings of proletarian internationalism and socialist patriotism have taken root in the hearts of the people of Czechoslovakia. The resolution pointed out that the primary task now is to overcome all influences of bourgeois ideology.

    In education, the resolution requires that the vast majority of young people in Czechoslovakia receive secondary education before 1970, and that primary compulsory education be extended to nine years within two or three years, followed by another three years of education in twelve-year schools, specialized schools, or apprentice schools. The university and specialized school education system will be more closely integrated with production, and the enrollment methods of these schools will be improved. Priority will be given to selecting young people who have participated in production practice and therefore have more life experience.

    The resolution stated that the Party will lead artists and cultural workers to develop socialist realism art. The prerequisite for developing socialist realism culture and art is to carry out a resolute struggle against all tendencies and sentiments that are incompatible with the Party and exploited by revisionism.

    Regarding the Party's work, the resolution calls for further strengthening the Party's leadership in ideological work and educating Party members. The resolution stated that Marxism-Leninism, as the foundation of science and revolutionary practice, must be developed and enriched with the new experience of the international working-class movement and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia's own new experience. As ideological education work becomes increasingly important in completing socialist construction, the resolution instructs the Central Committee to draft a long-term plan for the Party's ideological education work in all aspects.

    The resolution concludes by calling on all members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to strive to realize the task of completing socialist construction.

    捷共代表大会就中央工作报告通过决议
    号召全党努力完成社会主义建设
    指出反修正主义斗争是党的国际义务
    据新华社布拉格22日电  捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会21日就诺沃提尼同志所作的捷共中央委员会工作报告通过了一项决议。决议认为，捷克斯洛伐克在建设方面所取得的成就证明了，过去几次党代表大会所规定的捷克斯洛伐克建设社会主义的总路线是完全正确的。
    在谈到捷克斯洛伐克的外交政策时，决议表示深信，社会主义阵营的强大力量以及全世界爱好和平人民的努力将会粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋。决议说，捷克斯洛伐克积极支持苏联的和平政策和苏联提出的关于缓和国际紧张局势的各项建议。
    决议说，各国共产党和工人党去年11月的莫斯科会议所反映的共产党和工人党的巩固的团结和会议所通过的文件，是争取社会主义的斗争中的一切胜利的根本条件。
    我们认为，反对修正主义的斗争是我们的国际义务。修正主义攻击马克思列宁主义的基本原则，企图破坏共产主义革命运动的团结一致。我们坚决反对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表们所宣扬的反马克思主义的修正主义观点，这些观点充分反映在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的纲领中。在这个修正主义的纲领中，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟使自己脱离国际共产主义运动而孤立起来。
    决议说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党已经作了足够的努力来争取在马克思列宁主义的基础上同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和解。我们同其他兄弟党一样认为，今后我们两党之间的关系的发展要取决于南共的进一步行动，就国家政策来说，我们将继续同南斯拉夫保持对两国有利的那种相互关系。
    决议说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党将尽一切力量来争取各国工人阶级最广泛的国际团结。它将努力争取同各资本主义国家里的社会党、同它们的代表以及同其他工人组织和工会组织发展更密切的关系。
    在我们同社会主义阵营各国的关系中，我们将更加坚持不渝地遵循友好互助的原则，这个原则是无产阶级国际主义的最高表现。我们将继续加强捷克斯洛伐克和华沙条约缔约国的整个集体的防御力量和警惕性，因为帝国主义者还在进行反对社会主义国家的阴谋。我们将在经济互助委员会的组织内对国际社会主义分工积极作出贡献，对为整个社会主义阵营的利益而共同来最充分地使用社会主义的一切力量和资源积极作出贡献。
    在谈到国内社会主义建设的问题时，决议说，捷共今后的主要任务是：做到使社会主义的、合作的大规模生产在农业中占优势，消灭敌对阶级的残余，在最新的技术特别是自动化、机械化和化学化的基础上进一步发展生产力。同时，还必须使社会主义民主不断得到加强和完善，使劳动人民更多地积极参与国家和经济的管理，并且按照马克思列宁主义学说的精神继续加强人民在精神上和政治上的团结和完成文化革命。
    决议要求进一步迅速地和全面地提高人民的生活水平，特别是通过降低基本商品的价格和增加实际收入。在个人消费全面增加的同时，更加迅速地提高低收入家庭，特别是多子女家庭的个人消费。
    决议说，在农业生产方面面临的任务是：要利用一切潜力以便在短时期内在农业生产的单位面积产量方面和农业劳动生产率方面达到最发达的资本主义国家的水平。为了作到这一点，决议要求到1965年向农业提供十万台新的拖拉机和大量使畜牧业生产机械化的机器，要求使化学肥料的产量增加为1957年的两倍半。决议同时要求注意加强和发展农业合作社和从根本上改进国营农场的工作。
    决议强调要发展捷克斯洛伐克社会主义国家的经济组织和文化教育的作用。决议说，代表大会完全同意在国民经济和人民委员会方面采取的使劳动人民更多地参与决定经济和公共生活的一切问题的措施。为了保证共和国有最强大的防御能力和消除任何阻碍人民进行建设的企图，决议认为必须进一步加强军队、保安机关、检察和司法机关。
    决议说，捷克斯洛伐克在文化革命方面已经获得了许多成就，无产阶级国际主义和社会主义爱国主义的感情在捷克斯洛伐克已经深入人心。决议指出，现在的首要任务是克服资产阶级意识形态的一切影响。
    在教育方面，决议要求必须在1970年以前使捷克斯洛伐克绝大多数青年都受到中学教育，在两三年内把初级义务教育延长为九年，接着再在十二年制学校、专门学校或艺徒学校再受三年教育。大学和专科学校教育制度将与生产更密切地结合，这些学校的招生办法将予以改进，招生时将优先选拔那些已经参加过生产实践因而生活经验较为丰富的青年。
    决议说，党将领导艺术家和文化工作者来发展社会主义现实主义的艺术。发展社会主义现实主义文化艺术的先决条件就是：要进行坚决斗争，反对和党不相容而为修正主义所利用的一切倾向和情绪。
    在党的工作方面，决议要求进一步加强党在思想工作和教育党员方面的领导作用。决议说，作为科学和革命实践的基础的马克思列宁主义必须用国际工人阶级运动的新经验和捷克斯洛伐克共产党自己的新经验来发展和丰富。由于思想教育工作在完成社会主义建设方面的意义越来越大，决议责成中央委员会起草关于党在各个方面的思想教育工作的远景计划。
    决议最后号召捷克斯洛伐克共产党的全体党员努力为实现完成社会主义建设的任务而奋斗。
