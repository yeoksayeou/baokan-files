Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, June 14th: The first large-scale automated blast furnace of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex began pouring its foundation at 2:00 PM this afternoon. More than a thousand workers participating in the project joyfully held a groundbreaking ceremony.

This blast furnace, which workers call the first "steel giant" on the grasslands, has an effective furnace volume of 1,513 cubic meters and a designed annual output of 900,000 tons. It is expected to be put into production before National Day next year. Despite a reduction of more than 30% in construction investment, the blast furnace still maintains the original design's advanced technical level. It adopts new technologies such as high-pressure furnace top, steam blowing, carbon brick furnace bottom, and strong ventilation cooling at the furnace bottom. Charging, tapping, and adjusting the blast are all done using electrical automation. The opening and closing of the tapholes and transportation facilities are all mechanized.

Today, the blast furnace construction site in the center of the Baogang factory area was plastered with many large-character posters singing the praises of the General Line and the blast furnace. At noon, people held a groundbreaking ceremony for the blast furnace foundation pouring under the blazing sun. Leaders from Baotou City, Baogang Corporation, and Soviet experts spoke at the meeting to offer congratulations. Five worker representatives took the stage to express their determination to complete the pouring of 1,740 cubic meters of concrete for the blast furnace's main foundation with excellent quality within 24 hours, creating the newest record for large-scale blast furnace foundation pouring in the country. Their slogan was: "Fight hard for twenty-four (hours), comprehensively surpass Wuhan Steel, build the foundation quickly, well, economically and efficiently, and strive to surpass others." Amidst the sound of firecrackers and cheers, Gao Jinming, Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, cut the ribbon. Then, a command was issued from the command platform, and the first shift of hundreds of workers immediately sprang into action. On the pouring platform adorned with red flags, workers pushed carts, pouring concrete into more than a hundred funnels according to the marked lines. Below the platform, in the foundation pit, which was 26 meters in diameter and had steel bars as dense as a spider web, the huge sound of vibrators roared as more than eighty workers began tamping. More than twenty automatic dump trucks flowed continuously from four mixing stations, and belt conveyors transported concrete to the platform from all directions. A highly organized battle had begun. Various types of work teams immediately launched a red flag competition, and the political department of the construction site issued a commendation bulletin and progress report every hour.

The groundbreaking for the first large blast furnace marks the start of a full-scale construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex. At the iron smelting plant construction site, projects such as the pig casting machine room, the grinding machine room, and the molten iron ladle repair depot are being carried out simultaneously with the blast furnace project. The foundations for three hot blast stoves will be poured by the end of the month. Outside the iron smelting plant, across the sandy wilderness from the Ula Mountains to the Yellow River, are buildings and construction frames everywhere. The coking chemical plant, the machine repair area, the refractory material plant, the cement project, as well as the large thermal power station being built in cooperation with the electricity department, and the station and car dumper room being built in cooperation with the railway department, are all under large-scale construction. The Baiyun Obo iron ore mine is also being stepped up construction, and these projects must all be partially or fully put into production before the blast furnace starts tapping iron.

    内蒙古草原上的“钢铁巨人”
    包钢首座大高炉破土兴工
    新华社包头14日电　包头钢铁联合企业第一号大型自动化高炉14日下午两点钟开始浇灌基础，参加这项工程的一千多名职工，欢欣鼓舞地举行了开工典礼。
    这座被工人们称作草原上第一个“钢铁巨人”的高炉，炉体有效容积为一千五百一十三立方公尺，设计年产量为九十万吨。明年国庆节以前就可以投入生产。在建设投资减少30％多的情况下，高炉仍保持原设计的先进技术水平。它采用高压炉顶、蒸汽鼓风、炭砖炉底和炉底强力通风冷却等新技术，装料、出铁和调剂鼓风等，运用电气自动化操作，开闭铁水口和运输设施等全部是机械化的。
    包钢厂区中心的高炉工地上，今天贴出了许多歌唱总路线和高炉的诗歌大字报。中午，人们在火热的太阳下举行了高炉基础浇灌开工典礼。包头市、包钢总公司等的负责人和苏联专家在会上讲话祝贺。有五位工人代表登台表示决心，他们要在二十四小时内以优等质量完成高炉本体基础一千七百四十立方公尺的混凝土浇灌任务，创造全国大型高炉基础浇灌的最新纪录。他们的口号是：“苦战二十四（小时），全面超武钢，多快好省建基础，争取后来居上。”在鞭炮声和欢呼声中，中共包头市委书记高锦明剪断彩绸，接着总指挥台上发出号令，第一班几百个工人立刻行动起来。在红旗招展的浇灌平台上，工人们推起小车，按照划好的线路把混凝土倒在一百多个漏斗里。平台下面，直径二十六公尺、钢筋密如蛛网的基础坑里，发出了震动器的巨大响声，八十多名工人开始捣固了。二十多部自动翻斗汽车，从四个搅拌站里川流不息地开来，皮带运输机从四面八方把混凝土送上了平台。有高度组织的战斗就这样开始了。各工种工队立即展开了红旗竞赛，工地政治部每隔一小时就发布一次表扬快报和进度情况。
    第一座大型高炉的破土兴工，标志着包头钢铁联合企业的建设工程全面大动工了。在炼铁厂工地，和高炉工程同时进行的，还有铸铁机室、碾泥机室、铁水罐修理库等工程。三座热风炉月底就浇灌基础。在炼铁厂以外从乌拉山到黄河边的沙滩旷野上，是一片片的建筑物和建筑架，焦炭化学厂、机修区、耐火材料厂、水泥工程，以及电力部门配合建设的大型热电站，铁道部门配合建设的车站、翻车机室等都在大规模施工，白云鄂博铁矿山也在加紧建设，在高炉出铁以前这些工程都要全部和部分投入生产。
