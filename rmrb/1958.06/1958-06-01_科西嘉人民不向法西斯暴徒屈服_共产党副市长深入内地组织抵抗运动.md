Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Paris: The people of Corsica are not yielding to the fascist rioters.

The Communist members of the Ajaccio City Council, the island's capital, announced on the 30th that they have decided to no longer perform their duties, "never to participate in any activities directed by those who attempt to impose a dictatorship on the Republic," and they will not "cooperate with those who usurp legitimate power."

According to a report from the Corsican island of Sartène by a reporter from the Italian "Milan Daily," the situation in Sartène remains chaotic. In the evenings, anti-de Gaulle slogans such as "Block the road to fascism" appeared on the walls, along with symbols of the sickle and hammer.

The reporter said that the Communist Deputy Mayor of Ajaccio, Martin Borgomano, has gone deep into the Corsican interior to organize a resistance movement.

In other news, primary and secondary school teachers on Corsica participated in the nationwide "Defend the Republic" strike on the 30th.

On this day, about 30% of the teachers in Ajaccio and Bastia participated in the strike.

    这个岛的首府阿耶佐市议会的共产党议员30日宣布，他们决定不再执行任务，“决不参加那些企图对共和国实行独裁统治的人所指挥的任何活动”，他们不“同篡夺合法权力的人合作”。
    据意大利“米兰日报”记者自科西嘉岛萨得尼发出的消息说，在萨得尼，局势仍然混乱，晚间，墙壁上出现了反对戴高乐的标语，如“堵住法西斯主义的道路”等，还出现有镰刀和锤子的标记。
    这个记者说，阿耶佐的共产党副市长马丹·博尔果马尼已经深入科西嘉岛内地，组织抵抗运动。
    另外有消息说，科西嘉岛上的中小学教师参加了30日举行的“保卫共和国”全国大罢教。
    在这一天，阿耶佐市和巴斯的亚市参加罢教的教员约占教员总数的30％左右。
