    More on Not Believing Blindly in Foreign Things
    Méi Ěr
    A short article entitled "Do Not Believe Blindly in Foreign Things" was published on page four of the People's Daily on May 26th. It now seems that the issue of not believing blindly in foreign things cannot be discussed in just one article, and it is necessary to continue the discussion in further articles.
    Believing blindly in foreign things manifests itself in various ways. One of them is: everything must be done according to the regulations in foreign books. Before doing anything, one must first check foreign books; if there is a theoretical basis, then do it; if there is no basis, then don't do it. Even if someone succeeds in doing something not according to the regulations in foreign books, that is still not acceptable; if foreign books do not acknowledge it, it cannot be considered a scientific invention or creation. Researchers at the Ministry of Chemical Industry successfully researched the semi-hydrate method of producing phosphoric acid, but because no other country had used this method, the chief engineer expressed doubt. Ma Guorong, a young technician at the Tianjin Renli Food Factory, successfully researched the elimination of Salmonella in egg products, but because no basis for this could be found in foreign literature, people who considered themselves knowledgeable came out to prevent the factory from adopting this invention.
    Theory guides practice, but theory also comes from practice. All scientific theories are created by people from practice. At the same time, scientific theories are not immutable; the original principles and laws will change with the development of objective things, some need to be supplemented, some need to be revised, and some even need to be negated. After studying pre-imperialist capitalism, Engels and Marx said that socialist revolution could not be victorious in a single country. After studying imperialism, Lenin concluded that socialism could be victorious in a single country. This is precisely the case in reality. There are many typical examples of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism in China as well. This is also the case in the natural sciences; laws that were previously considered irrefutable have later been shaken. The law of conservation of parity is one such example.
    Since scientific theories are created by people from practice, all countries have their own practices and are therefore in a position to create theories. The three major socialist transformations are the practice of the Chinese people. Summarizing the experiences in this area can lead to writing scientific theories about the three major transformations. The universal development of local industries is the practice of the Chinese people. Summarizing the experiences in this area can lead to writing scientific theories about the universal development of local industries. The elimination of the four pests is the practice of the Chinese people. Summarizing the experiences in this area can lead to writing scientific theories about the elimination of the four pests. There is no reason why China can only work according to the scientific theories in foreign books and cannot create its own theories.
    Perhaps some people will say: the Chinese people are not cultured enough; they can only have practice but not theory. This is of course not true. To give a recent example published in the newspapers: Zhou Xingnan, a young worker in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, has concentrated his technical experience from on-site operations over the past three years and written three scientific and technological theory books. The already published "Steel Spark On-Site Inspection Method" has received good reviews. Shen Qian, an engineer in charge of the Wuxi City Mechanical Engineering Society, said: "This book integrates scientific theoretical knowledge with practical production experience. This is difficult for general engineering and technical personnel to do."
    It is completely a kind of blind faith to insist on doing everything according to the regulations in foreign books. However, some people emphasize that everything must be done according to foreign books because they have other purposes. Some do so because if they do not emphasize this issue, it will not be enough to show that they are foreign experts who have studied abroad and read foreign books. Others do so because they have no real talent and learning other than the ability to memorize foreign dogmas; if they do not emphasize this issue, their true colors will be revealed.

### 再谈不要迷信外国

    再谈不要迷信外国
    梅耳
    在5月26日的人民日报四版上发表了一篇“不要迷信外国”的短文。现在看来，不要迷信外国的问题，不是一篇文章所能谈了的，有必要写文章继续谈谈。
    迷信外国有各种各样的表现，其中之一是：一切事情都要按照洋书的规定去办。在没有做之前，先要查查洋书，有理论根据就做，没有根据就不做。即使有人不按照洋书上的规定做成功了，那也不行，洋书不承认，不能算是科学上的发明创造。化学工业部研究人员研究成功了制造磷酸的半水法，但因别的国家还没有用过这个方法，主要工程师就表示怀疑。天津仁立食品厂青年技术员马国荣研究成功了消灭蛋品中的沙门氏菌，也因为在外国文献上找不到这方面的根据，自以为有学问的人就出来阻止厂方采用这个发明。
    理论是指导实践的，但是理论又是从实践中来的。一切科学理论，都是人们从实践中创造的。同时，科学理论，也不是一成不变的，原来的原理、定律，是会随着客观事物的发展而变化，有的需要补充，有的需要修改，有的还要否定。恩格斯和马克思研究帝国主义的前期资本主义后，说社会主义革命不能在单独一个国家内获得胜利，列宁研究了帝国主义后，得出结论说：社会主义可以在单独一个国家内胜利。事实也正是如此。这种创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的典型事例，在中国也很多。在自然科学方面也是这样，过去被人认为不可推翻的定律，后来被人动摇了，宇称守恒定律就是一个例子。
    既然科学理论是人们从实践中创造出来的，各国人民都有自己的实践，也都有条件创造理论。社会主义三大改造，这是中国人民的实践，把这方面的经验加以总结，就可以写出有关三大改造的科学理论。普遍发展地方工业，这是中国人民的实践，把这方面的经验加以总结，就可以写出有关普遍发展地方工业的科学理论来。除四害，是中国人民的实践，把这方面的经验加以总结，就可以写出有关除四害的科学理论。没有什么理由，中国只能按照洋书上的科学理论去工作，而不能自己创造理论。
    也许有人会说：中国人民文化不高，只能有实践不能有理论。这当然不是事实。举个报纸上最近发表的例子：江苏无锡市青年工人周兴南三年多来集中了现场操作的技术经验，写成了三本科技理论书。已经出版的一本“钢铁火花现场检查法”得到了好评。无锡市机械工程学会负责人沈潜工程师说：“这本书把科学理论知识和实际生产经验融化为一。这是一般工程技术人员所难以做到的。”
    一定要按照洋书的规定办事，这完全是迷信。不过，有些人所以强调一切都要按照洋书办事，是另有目的的，有的是因为不强调这个问题，不足以显出自己是出过洋、留过学、读过洋书的洋专家；有的是因为自己除了背诵洋教条的本领外，并无真才实学，不强调这个问题，就要原形毕露。
