Nanchang, June 9 (Reporter Li Jiuzhe) – Jiangxi Province is actively preparing for the development of local industry next year to ensure an even greater leap forward in industrial construction next year based on this year's great leap forward. Jiangxi Province's experience proves that preparing for industry next year is not only possible but also very necessary.

Jiangxi Province originally planned to increase investment in local industry in 1959 by one and a half times compared to this year, and to build several times more new factories and mines than this year. According to calculations, the supply of raw materials and machinery and equipment will be far from meeting the needs of this development. For example, industry will need an estimated 200,000 tons of iron next year, but the iron and steel plants planned to be built this year can only provide 56,000 tons for next year's construction. Another example is petroleum. With 5,000 tractors and about 1,000 cars put into production in 1959, these two items alone will require an additional 33,000 tons of petroleum supply, but the state's supply will not increase much next year, and the province's current production cannot keep up with the demand. Similar problems exist with other aspects such as machinery and equipment and technical strength.

The basic policy of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee to solve the above problems is: self-reliance and early preparation. The method is: the mass line, mobilizing the whole people to solve the new contradictions that have emerged in this industrial undertaking by the whole people. In order to correctly implement the general line's principle of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, the Provincial Party Committee, after arranging the construction of large and medium-sized factories and mines, specially convened a provincial conference on the development of small-scale factories and mines a few days ago. The meeting determined that it is necessary to immediately mobilize the whole people to build small-scale raw material industries such as iron smelting, oil refining, and steelmaking in order to produce enough raw materials to ensure a greater leap forward in industry next year. The specific plan is to increase the number of various small blast furnaces for iron smelting to be built throughout the province this year from the original plan of 22 to 180, increasing the production capacity from the original plan of 56,000 tons to 226,000 tons; small oil refineries will increase from the original plan of 31 to 89, increasing the production capacity from the original plan of 25,000 tons to 55,700 tons. In addition, 15 small steel mills will be built with a production capacity of 610 tons. The equipment needed to build the above-mentioned small-scale factories and mines can be completely solved within the province, and funding is not a problem either. Therefore, these small-scale factories and mines can all be completed and put into production before the end of this year. According to calculations at the meeting, after the completion of the above 293 various small-scale factories and mines, the main raw materials such as pig iron, petroleum, and copper can basically meet the needs of industrial development next year.

Electricity and coal are pioneering industries. Jiangxi Province has also made preparations in this regard for next year's industrial leap forward. Each special district, county, and relevant provincial department is building a large number of small power plants with a capacity of 1,000 to 2,000 kilowatts or less to solve the power problems of small factories and mines in the future. At the same time, they will accelerate the construction of nine large and medium-sized power plants in Jiujiang, Leping, Nanchang, and Zhangshukeng to make them the backbone of future industrial power. Regarding the machinery and equipment needed for industrial development next year, all departments are actively starting to make arrangements. In this regard, the method adopted by Jiangxi is to adjust investment, actively expand existing machinery factories, and give full play to the potential of existing machinery factories.

Preparing the money for next year's use this year is another characteristic of Jiangxi Province's preparations for next year's industrial great leap forward. The methods are divided into two types: active and passive. The active method is to actively develop light industry, which accumulates the fastest, while developing heavy industry. This year, we will strive to complete two textile factories with 55,000 spindles each and a number of sugar factories and paper mills ahead of schedule and put them into production, in order to quickly accumulate funds for next year's great leap forward. The passive method is to build factories diligently and frugally, in the spirit of spending less money and doing more things, and doing things without spending money, to prepare funds for next year.

Jiangxi Province's special districts, counties, and relevant provincial departments are also taking three methods—short-term advanced studies, on-site training, and school training—to prepare technical strength for next year's industrial great leap forward.

The party and government leadership departments of Jiangxi Province believe that by doing the above preparations well, next year's industrial great leap forward will certainly leap farther and higher.

### 及早提出新任务　切实采取好措施  保证明年工业更大跃进  江西省委针对明年任务布置今年工作

    及早提出新任务　切实采取好措施
    保证明年工业更大跃进
    江西省委针对明年任务布置今年工作
    本报南昌9日电　记者李久泽报道：江西省积极为明年的地方工业的发展作准备，保证明年的工业建设在今年大跃进的基础上更有把握地争取更大的跃进。江西省的经验证明，工业为明年作准备不仅可能，而且是十分必要的。
    江西省原来计划，1959年地方工业的投资将比今年增加一倍半，新建厂矿要比今年多几倍。根据计算，原材料和机械设备的供应，远不能满足这种发展的需要。例如铁，明年工业的发展约计需要二十几万吨，但原计划今年兴建的炼铁厂只能为明年的建设提供五万六千吨。再如石油，1959年将五千台拖拉机和一千辆左右的汽车投入生产，仅这两项就需增加石油供应三万三千吨，但明年国家的供应增加不了许多，本省现在的生产又赶不上需要。其他如机械设备、技术力量，也有存在着类似的问题。
    江西省委解决上述问题的基本方针是：自力更生，及早准备；方法是：群众路线，发动全民来解决这个全民办工业中所出现的新的矛盾。省委为了正确地贯彻执行总路线所规定的大中小企业同时并举的方针，在安排了大中型厂矿的建设后，前几天专门召开了全省性的发展小型厂矿的会议。这个会议确定、立即发动全民兴办炼铁，炼油、炼钢等小型的原材料工业，以生产足够的原材料保障明年工业更大的跃进。具体计划是，今年全省建设的各种炼铁小高炉，由原计划的二十二个增加到一百八十个，生产能力由原计划的五万六千吨提高到二十二万六千吨；小型炼油厂由原计划的三十一个增加到八十九个，生产能力由原计划的二万五千吨提高到五万五千七百吨。此外，建设小型炼钢厂十五个，生产能力为六百一十吨。建设以上小型厂矿所需要的设备，省内完全可以自己解决，资金也不成问题。因此这些小型厂矿今年年底以前可全部建成投入生产。根据会议上的计算，以上共二百九十三个各种小型厂矿建成后，生铁、石油、铜等主要原材料便可基本满足明年工业发展的需要。
    电和煤是先行工业。江西省在这方面也为明年的工业跃进作了准备。各专、县和省级有关部门正在大量兴建一、二千瓩以下的小型电厂，以解决今后小型厂矿的动力问题；同时，将加快九江、乐平、南昌、樟树坑等九个大中型的电厂的建设，使它们成为今后工业动力的骨干。关于明年工业发展所需要的机械设备，各部门正积极着手安排。这方面，江西采取的办法是：调整投资、积极扩建现有机械厂，充分发挥现有机械厂的潜力。
    今年就准备下明年用的钱，是江西省为明年工业大跃进作准备的另一个特点。办法分积极的和消极的两种。积极的办法是在发展重工业的同时积极发展积累最快的轻工业。今年争取将两个各五万五千纱锭的纺织厂和一部分糖厂、造纸厂提早建成，投入生产，以便迅速地为明年的大跃进积累资金。消极的办法是勤俭建厂，本着少花钱多办事、不花钱也办事的精神，为明年准备资金。
    江西省各专、县、省级有关部门，还正在采取短期进修、现场培训、学校培养等三种办法，为明年工业大跃进准备技术力量。
    江西省党政领导部门相信，做好以上各项准备工作，明年的工业大跃进一定可以跃得更远，跃得更高。
