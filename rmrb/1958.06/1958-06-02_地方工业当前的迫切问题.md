Editor's Note:

　　The supply of raw materials and equipment is a pressing issue in the current development of local industries. The success of resolving these two problems will decisively influence the speed of local industrial development.

　　How can these two problems be solved? One approach is to dispatch large numbers of people to rush around everywhere, with local areas requesting from the central government, special districts requesting from provinces, counties requesting from special districts, and small towns going to large cities to buy. This method may seem convenient, but it is time-consuming and often leads to failure. Another approach is self-reliance. Whether it is a province, special district, or county, all should strive to solve problems within their own scope. As long as the determination is made to take this path, there will be many "tricks." Developing heavy industry locally; organizing urban-rural cooperation, with large factories contracting to build county industries; rummaging through warehouses, turning dead materials and machines into living treasures; tapping the potential of existing factories to strive for greater production increases; adopting "substitution" methods, using wood to replace steel when there is no steel; ... These are all practical and effective good methods. As long as we look downward, overcome dependency, our thinking will be enlightened, and all kinds of good methods will emerge before us. Shaanxi and Henan have chosen this path, and their practice proves that this is a correct path that can truly solve problems in a timely manner.

　　地方工业当前的迫切问题
    原材料和设备的供应问题，是当前发展地方工业中的迫切问题，这两个问题解决得好坏，对地方工业的发展速度有决定的意义。
    怎样解决这两个问题呢？一个办法是派出大批人马，四处奔波，地方向中央要，专区向省要，县向专区要，小城镇到大城市去买。这个办法似乎省事，其实既费时间，又往往会落空。另一个办法是自力更生，不论是省、专区或县，都力求在自己的范围内自己解决问题。只要下了决心走这条路，“窍门”是多得很的。就地发展重工业；组织城乡协作，由大工厂包建县工业；翻仓库，把死材料死机器变成活财宝；挖现有工厂的潜力，争取更多的增产；采取“代用”的办法，没有钢铁就用木材代替；……这些都是既切实又有效的好办法。只要眼睛向下，克服依赖心理，思想就会豁然开朗，各种各样的好办法就都涌到了面前来。陕西和河南选择了这条道路，他们的实践证明了：这是一条真正能够及时解决问题的正确的道路。
